and a shared, single point
of insertion.

00:12:21,675 --> 00:12:23,610
Judging from size and weight,

00:12:23,677 --> 00:12:25,846
uh, we can rule out
Biceps femoris.

00:12:25,913 --> 00:12:29,316
Biceps brachii, then.

00:12:29,383 --> 00:12:31,818
The tissue is clearly
infected.

00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:33,020
In fact,
it looks necrotic.

00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:34,321
What do you make

00:12:34,388 --> 00:12:36,323
of these, uh,
linear streaks?

00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,491
Well, I think

00:12:37,558 --> 00:12:38,659
they're hemorrhage lines.

00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:40,494
I bet this guy was
shooting steroids.

00:12:40,561 --> 00:12:42,496
With a dirty needle?

00:12:42,563 --> 00:12:44,131
That seems pretty stupid,

00:12:44,198 --> 00:12:47,467
even for somebody stupid enough
to kill an FBI agent.

00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:49,803
I guess he neglected
to swab his skin.

00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,205
Contaminants could've been

00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,207
pushed in with
the injection.

00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,576
The muscle looks like it fell
right off the bone.

00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:57,377
Like a piece
of well-cooked chicken.

00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,148
You know, I found some pieces

00:13:01,215 --> 00:13:02,816
<i>of mirror glass</i>
<i>inside the muscle.</i>

00:13:02,883 --> 00:13:04,985
(screaming)
<i>Maybe this guy was</i>
<i>in so much pain</i>

00:13:05,052 --> 00:13:08,222
<i>that he had to rip it out</i>
<i>right then and there.</i>

00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:11,058
HATFORD:
You listening to me, Vinnie?
I asked you a question.

00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,227
What are you doing
on Hill Street?

00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:14,561
Agent Hatford taped
this interview

00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:16,096
the night before
he was killed.

00:13:16,163 --> 00:13:18,198
I guess those muscles make you
deaf <i>and</i> dumb, huh?

00:13:18,265 --> 00:13:20,601
The suspect at the gas station
was heavily muscled.

00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:22,236
Which is why I figured
this could be the guy.

00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,338
Oh, don't eyeball me like that,
Vinnie.

00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:26,673
I am the F-B-friggin'-I,
are you feelin' me?

00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,743
Now put your hands
on the hood.

00:13:32,746 --> 00:13:34,781
We know about all those
little sweet ass

00:13:34,848 --> 00:13:36,016
Brazilian hos
you be running.

00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,518
And we don't
like it.

00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:38,952
But you know who
bothers us more?

00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:40,487
That armpit
you work for.

00:13:40,554 --> 00:13:41,522
That sewer rat.

00:13:41,588 --> 00:13:43,023
Where is he?

00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:44,258
How would I know?

00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:45,492
I don't work
for no one.

00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:47,194
"Os Punho."

00:13:47,261 --> 00:13:49,663
You don't know who I'm
talking about? "The Fist"?

00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:52,432
You tellin' me you know nothin'
about "The Fist"?

00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:54,134
How would you like
a fist up your...

00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:56,136
Unfortunately,

00:13:56,203 --> 00:13:58,472
Vinnie was only referred to
as "Vinnie."

00:13:58,539 --> 00:13:59,540
No last name.

00:13:59,606 --> 00:14:01,108
And Agent Hatford
never had a chance

00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:02,609
to write up a full report.

00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:05,412
Tox on your orphaned
biceps.

00:14:05,479 --> 00:14:07,948
Nandrolone decanoate,
methenolone enanthate,

00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:10,617
oxymetholone,
and HCG.

00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:12,352
That's quite a cocktail.

00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:13,387
Maybe

00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:15,289
this "Vinnie" is
a bodybuilder.

00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:16,323
It could be.

00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,925
This specific mix
was very popular

00:14:17,991 --> 00:14:20,260
with the local weight-
lifting community
a while back.

00:14:20,327 --> 00:14:21,628
The VELCORE Lab
was supplying it

00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,096
to all sorts of athletes.

00:14:23,163 --> 00:14:24,631
Before we shut them down.

00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:27,601
You know, there is someone who's
very familiar with this case.

00:14:27,668 --> 00:14:29,636
And he's real easy to get to.

00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:32,639
BRASS:
He's a murder suspect,
he's using your juice.

00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:34,641
His name is Vinnie.

00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,643
If you know
his last name,

00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,645
we'd appreciate
the information.

00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:41,648
Let me get this straight.

00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:45,152
You guys bust my company
for selling roids,

00:14:45,219 --> 00:14:50,157
give everybody else a chance
to plead out for easy time

00:14:50,224 --> 00:14:53,160
so the D.A. can make
an example out of me,

00:14:53,227 --> 00:14:56,496
because I'm-- me personally--

00:14:56,563 --> 00:15:03,003
I'm corrupting the very fabric
of American sports.

00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:06,373
You ruin my life.

00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,376
And now you want
me to help you?

00:15:09,443 --> 00:15:11,411
That pretty much sums it up,
yeah.

00:15:11,478 --> 00:15:12,913
Screw you.

00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,649
Yeah, I figured you'd have
an adverse reaction to that.

00:15:15,716 --> 00:15:20,988
I've only got 22 days left
of a 16-month rap,

00:15:21,054 --> 00:15:24,424
which means there is nothing
you can do for me or to me.

00:15:24,491 --> 00:15:25,792
Yeah, that's
why I decided

00:15:25,859 --> 00:15:28,362
to bring in an associate.

00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,764
Agent Bechman, would you
come in here, please?

00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:40,774
You work much
with federal agents?

00:15:40,841 --> 00:15:42,609
Actually, this is my first time.

00:15:42,676 --> 00:15:43,944
I'm a CSI-1.

00:15:44,978 --> 00:15:47,481
Were you held back?

00:15:47,548 --> 00:15:49,082
Career change.

00:15:52,352 --> 00:15:54,488
I was a physician.

00:15:55,522 --> 00:15:58,325
And screw you,
too, Fed.

00:15:58,392 --> 00:16:03,897
I... would prefer
to just educate you.

00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:09,369
For instance,
did you know

00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:12,406
that many people

00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:15,409
convicted
of drug offenses

00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:23,483
continue to engage in some form
of drug trade while in prison?

00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:27,087
Now, <i>United States</i>
<i>v. Delgado</i> held

00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:29,022
that if you so much

00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:33,026
as speak to someone for the
purpose of dealing drugs,

00:16:33,093 --> 00:16:34,461
even while incarcerated,

00:16:34,528 --> 00:16:39,499
that's Conspiracy to Conduct
a Racketeering Enterprise.

00:16:39,566 --> 00:16:42,269
Doesn't matter whether or not
you handed out the drugs.

00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:44,605
Your business activities
from prison

00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:47,074
violate the RICO statute.

00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,076
Even if I did something
like that--

00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:51,011
and I am not saying
that I did--

00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:54,548
I already got busted for it.

00:16:54,615 --> 00:16:56,016
That is double jeopardy.

00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:58,252
Not according to <i>Garrett</i>
<i>v. United States.</i>

00:16:58,318 --> 00:17:00,754
The double
jeopardy clause

00:17:00,821 --> 00:17:03,357
does not bar
cumulative punishments

00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:05,025
for continuing
criminal enterprises

00:17:05,092 --> 00:17:07,027
and underlying predicate
offenses.

00:17:07,094 --> 00:17:09,029
Your man knows the law.

00:17:09,096 --> 00:17:11,298
That's our Miles.

00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:15,269
If we determine that you do have

00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:18,205
some information
regarding this suspect

00:17:18,272 --> 00:17:21,475
which you choose not to share,

00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:25,679
then I can promise
that the full weight

00:17:25,746 --> 00:17:31,051
of the Department of Justice
and RICO section 1963

00:17:31,118 --> 00:17:34,721
will be brought
to bear upon you,

00:17:34,788 --> 00:17:38,225
and your 22 days
in Clark County Prison

00:17:38,292 --> 00:17:42,062
will become 20 years
in a federal penitentiary.

00:17:42,129 --> 00:17:45,132
Oh, and we get to take
everything you own.

00:17:51,705 --> 00:17:54,675
His name's Vinnie Mingus.

00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:58,178
He's one of those
Supreme Force Fighters.

00:17:58,245 --> 00:18:01,515
He's supposed to be
fighting today.

00:18:01,582 --> 00:18:03,584
(crowd cheering)

00:18:09,189 --> 00:18:11,158

Welcome to human cockfighting.

00:18:30,844 --> 00:18:32,446
Man, this is as real
as it gets.

00:18:32,513 --> 00:18:33,680
It's like
a bar fight

00:18:33,747 --> 00:18:36,316
spilled out
into the alleyway.
Like the Marquis

00:18:36,383 --> 00:18:38,652
of Queensberry,
I prefer boxing--

00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,786
the sweet science.

00:18:39,853 --> 00:18:42,890
There's Mingus.

Somebody around here
must have seen him.

VINNIE:
Get out of my way!

00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,536
Hey, Brass, I got him.

00:19:29,603 --> 00:19:31,071
(coughing)

00:19:31,138 --> 00:19:34,341
Didn't I get the message across
with the last guy?

00:19:34,408 --> 00:19:35,909
I'm sorry,
you can't come in here.

00:19:35,976 --> 00:19:37,878
LVPD, clear everybody
out of here.

00:19:37,945 --> 00:19:40,047
I want to have a word
with Mr. Mingus.
Please,

00:19:40,113 --> 00:19:41,114
I'm his doctor.

00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:43,784
What kind of getup is that?

00:19:43,851 --> 00:19:45,219
Don't touch me.

00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:46,954
We both know that
gun's not loaded.

00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:47,955
Las Vegas Police.

00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:49,089
Mr. Mingus, you're
under arrest.

00:19:49,156 --> 00:19:52,426
You're gonna have to shoot me
before you arrest me.

00:19:52,492 --> 00:19:53,861
Come on, go ahead.

00:19:53,927 --> 00:19:55,629
Shoot me.

00:19:57,831 --> 00:19:59,600
I've got backup coming.
He's not going anywhere.

00:20:12,312 --> 00:20:14,314
They're all fake!

00:20:15,816 --> 00:20:18,619
They're fake!

They're all fake!

Vinnie, you're making
a fool of yourself!

00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:30,330
I'm making a fool
out of myself?!

00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:31,765
Whoa!

00:20:31,832 --> 00:20:33,100
Hold your fire!

00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:34,401
Put the gun down!

00:20:34,468 --> 00:20:37,404
These guns are not even loaded.

00:20:37,471 --> 00:20:38,438
You see?

00:20:38,505 --> 00:20:40,274
(gunshot)

00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:43,644
(gasps and murmurs)

00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:56,944
Chaos erupted today
at the Delos Auditorium--

00:20:57,011 --> 00:20:59,580
home to the Supreme Force
Fighting Championship--

00:20:59,647 --> 00:21:02,583
after a police chase
through the crowded theater

00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:06,420
ended in the bizarre apparent
suicide of Vinnie Mingus...

00:21:06,487 --> 00:21:07,855
BRASS:
Thanks for your
cooperation, Doctor.

00:21:07,922 --> 00:21:08,889
Thank you.

00:21:08,956 --> 00:21:11,158
Okay, so the fight doctor says

00:21:11,225 --> 00:21:13,427
that Mingus came to him
with his arm all torn up.

00:21:13,494 --> 00:21:15,129
He's infected and feverish.

00:21:15,196 --> 00:21:17,898
So, the doctor
wraps up his arm,

00:21:17,965 --> 00:21:19,934
tells him to go
to a hospital,
Mingus refuses.

00:21:20,001 --> 00:21:23,104
So he gives him a bunch of
antibiotics, hopes for the best.

00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:25,273
Clearly, Mingus was involved
in some kind of assault.

00:21:25,339 --> 00:21:27,608
Why didn't the doctor inform
the authorities?

00:21:27,675 --> 00:21:29,777
He says he knows Mingus
and he's afraid of him.

00:21:29,844 --> 00:21:31,946
Says Mingus is half psychotic
on a good day.

00:21:32,013 --> 00:21:35,182
You know, maybe the
Agent Hatford interview

00:21:35,249 --> 00:21:36,851
spooked him--
Mingus goes nuts, follows him,

00:21:36,917 --> 00:21:38,019
takes him out.

00:21:38,085 --> 00:21:39,854
Well, thank you,
Captain,

00:21:39,921 --> 00:21:41,522
for all your
hard work.

00:21:41,589 --> 00:21:42,657
Sure. So what's next?

00:21:42,723 --> 00:21:43,758
"Os Punho"?

00:21:43,824 --> 00:21:45,927
We're going to finish
what we started.

00:21:45,993 --> 00:21:47,595
Keep me in the loop.
All right?

00:21:47,662 --> 00:21:49,463
All right.
We will.

00:21:56,337 --> 00:21:57,872
LANGSTON:
In Mingus's gym bag,

00:21:57,939 --> 00:22:01,776
we found Agent Hatford's
notebook, his badge

00:22:01,842 --> 00:22:03,711
and his gun.

00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:08,115
It's empty.

00:22:08,182 --> 00:22:10,351
A Davis P-380.

00:22:10,418 --> 00:22:13,321
It's a weird gun
for a fed to carry.

00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:17,258
Oh, my bad.

00:22:17,325 --> 00:22:19,460
It's a street piece.
Uh-huh.

00:22:19,527 --> 00:22:20,962
Must be Mingus's.

00:22:21,028 --> 00:22:23,931
Which means Agent Hatford's
weapon is still unaccounted for.

00:22:25,232 --> 00:22:26,434
Hmm.

00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,403
Roid Boy was sending out
a lot of pictures.

00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:30,871
They're all
of the Feebs.

00:22:30,938 --> 00:22:32,006
Looks like he
was conducting

00:22:32,073 --> 00:22:33,207
an investigation of his own.

00:22:34,709 --> 00:22:36,310
STOKES:
Track down that number.

00:22:36,377 --> 00:22:38,346
Run fingerprints, DNA.

00:22:39,547 --> 00:22:41,015
Swab last for trace.

00:22:41,082 --> 00:22:43,684
We always save the best
for last.

00:22:43,751 --> 00:22:46,587
Yes, David,
that's already getting old.

00:22:49,957 --> 00:22:51,325
Hey, Catherine.
Yeah?

00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:54,996
Do you remember a Jane Doe
we found off of Spencer Street

00:22:55,062 --> 00:22:56,530
about three months ago?

00:22:56,597 --> 00:22:58,366
Sadly, you're gonna
have to be

00:22:58,432 --> 00:23:00,201
more specific
than that.

00:23:00,268 --> 00:23:01,469
Pretty brunette,

00:23:01,535 --> 00:23:03,237
caught up in
prostitution, underage.

00:23:03,304 --> 00:23:05,973
Gunshot wound to the head.

00:23:08,576 --> 00:23:11,579
Okay, yes, I do remember her.
I saw a
picture of her

00:23:11,646 --> 00:23:13,881
on a board
in the FBI command post.

00:23:13,948 --> 00:23:15,916
She's mixed up
in this human trafficking ring.

00:23:15,983 --> 00:23:17,385
Did the feds talk to her?

00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:19,520
Yeah.

00:23:19,587 --> 00:23:21,455
<i>And they got it on video.</i>

00:23:29,897 --> 00:23:32,066
WILLOWS:
That's quite an
assembly line.

00:23:32,133 --> 00:23:34,268
STOKES:
Out with the old,
in with the new.

00:23:34,335 --> 00:23:35,870
ADAMS:
Yeah.

00:23:35,937 --> 00:23:37,338
Watch this.

00:23:37,405 --> 00:23:38,739
STANLEY:
Everything that you say

00:23:38,806 --> 00:23:40,207
in this room
is confidential.

00:23:40,274 --> 00:23:42,777
Now, do you know
what "confidential" means?

00:23:45,513 --> 00:23:47,815
My speak is not good,

00:23:47,882 --> 00:23:49,583
but...

00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:52,820
I understand good.

00:23:52,887 --> 00:23:55,222
Okay, how old are
you, sweetheart?

00:23:55,289 --> 00:23:57,558
Twenty-one.

00:23:57,625 --> 00:24:00,895
No, I know that that's what
they told you to say.

00:24:00,962 --> 00:24:03,831
Sweetie, how old
are you really?

00:24:03,898 --> 00:24:05,600
Sixteen.

00:24:05,666 --> 00:24:07,535
It's okay.

00:24:07,602 --> 00:24:09,503
You know,
we've seen

00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:13,808
a lot of young girls
like you on Hill Street

00:24:13,874 --> 00:24:16,110
being shoved
into limos

00:24:16,177 --> 00:24:17,845
and forced to do
God-knows-what

00:24:17,912 --> 00:24:20,281
with dirty, old men.

00:24:20,348 --> 00:24:22,483
Who brought
you here, Rio?

00:24:24,785 --> 00:24:27,722
I can't.

00:24:27,788 --> 00:24:29,824
He will kill me.

00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:34,662
I will be dead, you understand?

00:24:34,729 --> 00:24:38,332
You won't be dead,
because we will protect you.

00:24:38,399 --> 00:24:40,301
But you need
to help us.

00:24:40,368 --> 00:24:41,669
Who is he?

00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,441
Who is he?

00:24:47,508 --> 00:24:49,310
HATFORD:
Look, we're trying to
help you out here.

00:24:49,377 --> 00:24:51,579
We're giving you the
benefit of the doubt.

00:24:51,646 --> 00:24:53,547
But you're a prostitute,
a criminal.

00:24:53,614 --> 00:24:55,416
Unless you help us,
you're gonna go to jail.

00:24:55,483 --> 00:24:57,918
(sobbing):
No more talk, no more.

00:24:57,985 --> 00:25:00,521
I go to jail, okay?

00:25:00,588 --> 00:25:02,156
Please take me to jail.

00:25:02,223 --> 00:25:04,525
Please take me
to jail.

00:25:07,762 --> 00:25:09,597
BECHMAN:
Let her go.

00:25:16,771 --> 00:25:20,174
Their files indicate that
they never reinterviewed her.

00:25:20,241 --> 00:25:22,376
Three days later, she was dead.

00:25:22,443 --> 00:25:23,844
ADAMS:
Maybe Os Punho

00:25:23,911 --> 00:25:26,414
found out that she was picked up
and questioned.

00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,817
Had her killed on the street
as a warning to the other girls.

00:25:57,945 --> 00:26:00,948
♪ ♪

00:26:23,437 --> 00:26:24,805
(phone ringing)

00:26:24,872 --> 00:26:26,540
What's happening, Professor?

00:26:26,607 --> 00:26:28,109
LANGSTON:
I just printed
Vinnie Mingus's gun.

00:26:28,175 --> 00:26:29,777
At least, I thought
it was his gun.

00:26:29,844 --> 00:26:30,845
What do you mean?

00:26:30,911 --> 00:26:31,946
It appears to have

00:26:32,013 --> 00:26:34,148
Agent Hatford's prints
all over it.

00:26:34,215 --> 00:26:37,018
Now, why would an FBI agent
be carrying a street gun

00:26:37,084 --> 00:26:39,086
with a filed-down serial number
on it?

00:26:39,153 --> 00:26:40,588
He wouldn't--
maybe it's a drop gun.

00:26:40,655 --> 00:26:42,823
Are you saying Agent Hatford
was dirty?

00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:44,258
It happens.

00:26:44,325 --> 00:26:47,695
Maybe Agent Hatford was mixed up
with Mingus or Os Punho somehow.

00:26:47,762 --> 00:26:49,163
Yeah, it happens.
WOMAN:
Excuse me, sir.

00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:50,331
Hold on.
Captain Brass,

00:26:50,398 --> 00:26:52,199
you have a 420
on Hill Street.

00:26:52,266 --> 00:26:54,702
(sighs)
Hooker or pimp?

00:27:07,114 --> 00:27:08,883
Agent Bechman, I was
actually gonna call you.

00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:09,951
What are you
doing here?

00:27:10,017 --> 00:27:11,852
The operation
was undercover.

00:27:16,791 --> 00:27:19,860
Okay, David, what have you got
for me tonight?

00:27:19,927 --> 00:27:21,729
(beeping)

00:27:38,512 --> 00:27:39,847
Oh, man.

00:27:40,881 --> 00:27:42,550
It's Agent Stanley.

00:27:42,617 --> 00:27:43,584
(phone ringing)

00:27:43,651 --> 00:27:44,819
Yeah, Wendy?

00:27:44,885 --> 00:27:47,555
Captain, I just got this e-mail
from FBI Quantico,

00:27:47,622 --> 00:27:50,124
and there is no record
of any agent

00:27:50,191 --> 00:27:51,993
by the name
of William Ray Hatford.

00:27:52,059 --> 00:27:53,694
They're saying this guy
was a fake.

00:27:53,761 --> 00:27:54,829
Okay, thanks.

00:28:08,676 --> 00:28:11,946
ROBBINS:
There's stippling and
powder burns around the wound.

00:28:12,013 --> 00:28:14,949
It was a close-range shot.

00:28:15,016 --> 00:28:16,717
Somebody
probably walked

00:28:16,784 --> 00:28:19,520
right up behind her
on the street.

00:28:23,658 --> 00:28:25,960
Looks like Emma was suicidal.

00:28:28,029 --> 00:28:29,931
Those are old scars.

00:28:29,997 --> 00:28:32,500
Yes, but vertical,
which means she was serious.

00:28:32,566 --> 00:28:34,802
Guess she finally got her wish.

00:28:35,836 --> 00:28:37,171
PHILLIPS:
Hey, Live Scan

00:28:37,238 --> 00:28:39,206
got a hit
on her prints.

00:28:39,273 --> 00:28:40,841
Her real name is Emma Mosler.

00:28:40,908 --> 00:28:42,243
She's got a record.

00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:44,045
She did two years
for prostitution.

00:28:44,111 --> 00:28:48,049
So, she was a prostitute
posing as an FBI agent

00:28:48,115 --> 00:28:49,850
posing... as a prostitute?

00:28:49,917 --> 00:28:53,020
To bust a prostitution ring?

00:28:57,124 --> 00:28:58,492
Okay, take everything,
and we'll figure out

00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,394
what's real and what's
not real later.

00:29:11,105 --> 00:29:12,373
There was this trucker

00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,708
in Gerald, Missouri,

00:29:13,774 --> 00:29:15,242
who rolled into town
and told everybody

00:29:15,309 --> 00:29:16,344
he was a DEA agent.

00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:19,947
Started busting
every meth head in town.

00:29:20,014 --> 00:29:21,582
It was months before
somebody finally caught on.

00:29:21,649 --> 00:29:23,551
Don't try to make
me feel better.

00:29:23,618 --> 00:29:25,219
BRIGGS:
Can I give it
a try, Jim?

00:29:25,286 --> 00:29:26,287
I've been
with the Bureau

00:29:26,354 --> 00:29:27,788
15 years.

00:29:27,855 --> 00:29:29,023
This would have fooled me.

00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:30,491
Well, it didn't fool
Vinnie Mingus.

00:29:30,558 --> 00:29:31,525
He knew they were fakes.

00:29:31,592 --> 00:29:32,994
He thought we were fakes, too.

00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,795
Blew his brains out
trying to prove it.

00:29:34,862 --> 00:29:36,530
Be nice to find Agent Bechman

00:29:36,597 --> 00:29:38,299
before Os Punho does--
we anywhere on that?

00:29:38,366 --> 00:29:39,834
No.

00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,236
All we have
is a lease made out to...

00:29:42,303 --> 00:29:45,673
I Can See For Miles,

David, Foxtrot,

00:30:00,288 --> 00:30:01,956
three, four, eight.

00:30:05,626 --> 00:30:08,896
Registered owner is
I Can See For Miles, Inc.

00:30:08,963 --> 00:30:11,132
Same address
as their command post.

00:30:12,366 --> 00:30:14,802
It looks like Miles
covered all his bases.

00:30:16,504 --> 00:30:18,606
Yeah, well, maybe Emma
didn't cover hers.

00:30:18,673 --> 00:30:21,142
We know when
and where

00:30:21,208 --> 00:30:22,443
she swiped her card.

00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:24,211
The bill's got
to get sent <i>somewhere.</i>

00:30:27,014 --> 00:30:28,282
LANGSTON:
A halfway house?

00:30:28,349 --> 00:30:30,251
BRASS:
Yeah...
well, we think

00:30:30,318 --> 00:30:33,020
she was stealing identities
from the residents.

00:30:33,087 --> 00:30:35,256
How hard
could that be?

00:30:41,996 --> 00:30:44,398
I'm Detective Jim Brass,
Las Vegas Police.

00:30:44,465 --> 00:30:46,400
This is Ray Langston
from the crime lab.

00:30:48,903 --> 00:30:51,505
Is there someone in charge here
that I can talk to?

00:30:51,572 --> 00:30:52,873
That would be me.

00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,342
Until 4:00.

00:30:55,376 --> 00:30:56,777
Do you know
this woman?

00:30:58,946 --> 00:31:00,281
Yeah, sure, I know her.

00:31:00,348 --> 00:31:01,515
Emma.

00:31:01,582 --> 00:31:03,684
You know, most of
the ladies here

00:31:03,751 --> 00:31:06,621
are pretty nasty,
but man, oh, man, she is sweet.

00:31:06,687 --> 00:31:08,155
I seen her in
the shower once

00:31:08,222 --> 00:31:09,690
shaving her pits.

00:31:09,757 --> 00:31:11,425
High point of my life.

00:31:11,492 --> 00:31:13,427
Is she a resident?
Uh-huh.

00:31:13,494 --> 00:31:15,363
Okay.

00:31:17,098 --> 00:31:19,166
Let's see.

00:31:19,233 --> 00:31:21,769
Says here that Emma
signed out two days ago.

00:31:21,836 --> 00:31:24,538
Never signed
back in.

00:31:24,605 --> 00:31:25,539
And nobody noticed?

00:31:25,606 --> 00:31:28,342
Look, this isn't
a lockup facility.

00:31:28,409 --> 00:31:30,344
Everybody
here is free

00:31:30,411 --> 00:31:31,579
to come and go.

00:31:31,646 --> 00:31:33,614
They're just supposed
to sign in and out.

00:31:33,681 --> 00:31:35,049
How about this guy?

00:31:35,116 --> 00:31:37,218
You seen him?

00:31:37,285 --> 00:31:39,720
Yeah, sure, um, Miles Gelson.

00:31:39,787 --> 00:31:43,157
Uh, he came to us
courtesy of CNPH.

00:31:43,224 --> 00:31:46,460
Central Nevada
Psychiatric Hospital.

00:31:46,527 --> 00:31:47,728
Very good.

00:31:47,795 --> 00:31:49,130
LANGSTON:
What about this man?

00:31:49,196 --> 00:31:50,998
Hmm.

00:31:51,065 --> 00:31:52,833
Billy Ray Salvy,

00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:55,002
another resident.

00:31:55,069 --> 00:31:57,038
He's been MIA for three days.

00:31:57,104 --> 00:31:58,806
Another resident.

00:31:58,873 --> 00:32:00,541
So, we've been working a case
with a couple of...

00:32:00,608 --> 00:32:01,642
Crazy people?

00:32:01,709 --> 00:32:02,910
It's okay to
call them that.

00:32:02,977 --> 00:32:04,712
That's what I call them.

00:32:04,779 --> 00:32:06,847
Look, um,
you're welcome

00:32:06,914 --> 00:32:08,749
to talk to Miles if you'd like.

00:32:08,816 --> 00:32:09,617
He's here?

00:32:10,651 --> 00:32:12,253
According to this.

00:32:15,423 --> 00:32:16,424
Here we go.

00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:17,892
No, no, no, hold on.

00:32:17,959 --> 00:32:19,260
We'll take it
from here.

00:32:19,327 --> 00:32:20,595
Thanks.

00:32:37,178 --> 00:32:38,746
Hello, Miles.

00:32:40,615 --> 00:32:41,782
We have some
questions

00:32:41,849 --> 00:32:43,751
that need to be answered.

00:32:56,264 --> 00:32:59,300
(whispers):
I'm undercover here.

00:33:01,335 --> 00:33:03,471
All the people,
they think

00:33:03,537 --> 00:33:04,972
I'm with them.

00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:08,843
So... if you want to talk...

00:33:11,545 --> 00:33:15,650
...put handcuffs on me,
and take me outside.

00:33:15,716 --> 00:33:17,818
Got to be careful,
very careful,

00:33:17,885 --> 00:33:19,053
'cause I can't,

00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,488
I can't blow this cover.

00:33:20,554 --> 00:33:22,056
I understand.

00:33:23,391 --> 00:33:25,059
Just one second.

00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,763
Captain,
the man is clearly

00:33:28,829 --> 00:33:31,198
a fantasy-prone
personality type.

00:33:31,265 --> 00:33:35,336
I think it's best if we...

00:33:35,403 --> 00:33:37,071
go along with it.

00:33:37,138 --> 00:33:39,707
You're the doctor.

00:33:41,342 --> 00:33:42,476
(shouting):
Miles Gelson,

00:33:42,543 --> 00:33:43,945
we have a warrant
for your arrest.

00:33:44,011 --> 00:33:45,980
Stand up.

00:33:46,047 --> 00:33:48,749
Put your hands
behind your back!

00:33:48,816 --> 00:33:50,318
Let's go.

00:33:54,655 --> 00:33:56,157
MILES:
<i>You're probably wondering</i>

00:33:56,223 --> 00:34:00,294
where I was when
Agent Stanley was...

00:34:00,361 --> 00:34:02,196
uh, was, uh...

00:34:04,565 --> 00:34:07,768
I, uh, I received a call from...

00:34:07,835 --> 00:34:08,970
Gun!

00:34:10,171 --> 00:34:11,806
(glass breaking)

00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:24,485
Dispatch, this is Brass.

00:34:24,552 --> 00:34:25,987
Shots fired, my location.

00:34:26,053 --> 00:34:27,588
Suspect down.

00:34:27,655 --> 00:34:28,756
He's dead.
Dead?

00:34:28,823 --> 00:34:29,757
Yes, sir.

00:34:29,824 --> 00:34:30,825
Code four.

00:34:30,891 --> 00:34:32,893
(horn blaring)

00:34:34,228 --> 00:34:36,230
(horn stops)

00:34:40,901 --> 00:34:43,237
Good work, Detective.

00:34:43,304 --> 00:34:45,172
I'm putting you in
for commendation.

00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:46,240
Shut up!

00:34:46,307 --> 00:34:48,409
Shut up, you whack job!
You see this?!

00:34:48,476 --> 00:34:50,578
Captain...
You see this?
This is real. You see this?

00:34:50,645 --> 00:34:52,079
People are dead here
because of you!
Stop it.

00:34:52,146 --> 00:34:53,514
Jim, I've got it!
Because of you!

00:34:53,581 --> 00:34:54,649
You're a fraud!
I got it!

00:34:54,715 --> 00:34:57,118
Get him out of here.
(sirens approaching)

00:35:13,417 --> 00:35:16,253
BRASS:
The driver's cell phone
was recovered at the scene.

00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,922
Clearly, Mingus was spreading 
the word about the phony feds.

00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:23,260
I figure the shooter
was one of Os Punho's

00:35:23,327 --> 00:35:25,396
lower level punks,

00:35:25,462 --> 00:35:27,931
finishing what
Mingus started.

00:35:27,998 --> 00:35:29,733
How much time is
he looking at?

00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,870
Let's see-- impersonating
a federal officer,

00:35:32,936 --> 00:35:35,506
at least two counts
of accessory murder,

00:35:35,572 --> 00:35:38,442
and every person
he hauled off the
street to "interview"

00:35:38,509 --> 00:35:40,344
would be an additional
count of kidnapping.

00:35:40,411 --> 00:35:42,579
15 to 20, minimum.

00:35:42,646 --> 00:35:44,148
His best bet
would be to plead

00:35:44,214 --> 00:35:45,883
diminished capacity.

00:35:45,949 --> 00:35:48,052
He's got that covered.

00:35:52,289 --> 00:35:55,993
This is <i>all</i>
from the fake command post?

00:35:57,161 --> 00:35:58,629
Huh.

00:35:58,696 --> 00:36:00,164
Uh-huh.

00:36:01,565 --> 00:36:02,633
What are you doing?

00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,235
That is a good question.

00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:07,771
This is the
evidence ledger

00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:09,473
from the fake
feds' locker.

00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:11,608
It's filled with dates

00:36:11,675 --> 00:36:14,311
and corresponding
alphabetic codes.

00:36:14,378 --> 00:36:17,614
This is the date that
that girl, Rio, was killed.

00:36:17,681 --> 00:36:18,882
So it stands

00:36:18,949 --> 00:36:20,351
to reason that...

00:36:20,417 --> 00:36:22,353
This code could identify
the murder weapon.

00:36:22,419 --> 00:36:27,024
That is a perfectly
logical conclusion.

00:36:27,091 --> 00:36:28,258
It's also wrong.

00:36:29,793 --> 00:36:32,296
That code isn't on
any of these weapons.

00:36:32,363 --> 00:36:35,599
In fact, none of the
codes on the ledger are.

00:36:36,934 --> 00:36:39,503
I've tried to
decipher it using

00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:43,207
simple shift and substitution
codes, no luck.

00:36:43,273 --> 00:36:47,077
Unless we find a cipher key,
we may never figure it out.

00:36:50,614 --> 00:36:52,616
Maybe Miles is the key.

00:37:02,726 --> 00:37:04,728
Hello, Miles.

00:37:08,232 --> 00:37:11,068
I'm truly sorry
about your friends.

00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:18,909
I'm here
because I need your help.

00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:23,714
This, uh, entry
in your evidence ledger

00:37:23,781 --> 00:37:27,284
corresponds to the day
that girl, Rio, was killed.

00:37:28,919 --> 00:37:30,621
What does it mean?

00:37:41,432 --> 00:37:42,666
All right...

00:37:43,934 --> 00:37:45,669
Miles, um...

00:37:51,775 --> 00:37:53,777
I think I know
what happened, Miles.

00:37:55,746 --> 00:38:00,484
I think you and Emma
and Billy Ray...

00:38:00,551 --> 00:38:03,087
were trying to clean up
your corner of the world,

00:38:03,153 --> 00:38:04,421
do some good.

00:38:07,658 --> 00:38:10,828
To do that, you had
to reinvent yourselves.

00:38:17,234 --> 00:38:20,070
All I did was get them killed.

00:38:20,137 --> 00:38:23,007
Look, they died fighting.

00:38:23,073 --> 00:38:25,643
Trying to help people
who couldn't help themselves.

00:38:31,915 --> 00:38:35,953
Now let me help you
finish what you started.

00:38:52,102 --> 00:38:56,807
L-G-D-G-D-S

00:38:56,874 --> 00:39:00,744
dash U-A-P

00:39:02,346 --> 00:39:08,018
means "Little guy dropped
gun down sewer."

00:39:09,687 --> 00:39:13,557
"Unable to
apprehend perp."

00:39:13,624 --> 00:39:17,628
Corresponding
evidence tagged with

00:39:17,695 --> 00:39:20,664
G-T-L-B-D

00:39:20,731 --> 00:39:24,168
dash G-N-H-A-S:

00:39:24,234 --> 00:39:27,071
"Gun little

00:39:27,137 --> 00:39:31,608
"bastard dropped.

00:39:31,675 --> 00:39:36,180
Gonna nail his ass someday."

00:39:40,084 --> 00:39:42,219
SIMMS:
Now, have you tried this before?

00:39:42,286 --> 00:39:43,487
Have you screened a weapon?

00:39:43,554 --> 00:39:45,522
No.

00:39:45,589 --> 00:39:47,024
Want to try?

00:39:47,091 --> 00:39:48,325
All right.
All right.

00:39:48,392 --> 00:39:51,762
Okay,
you take the gun,

00:39:51,829 --> 00:39:55,532
and I want you
to swab the grip.

00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:57,534
Right in here.

00:39:57,601 --> 00:39:59,203
Perfect.

00:39:59,269 --> 00:40:00,571
I'll hit it with phenol.

00:40:02,106 --> 00:40:03,273
Nothing.

00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:04,708
All right.

00:40:04,775 --> 00:40:08,445
Now, we're going
to swab the magazine.

00:40:08,512 --> 00:40:11,515
'Cause that gets
a lot of handling action.

00:40:13,617 --> 00:40:15,386
Okay.

00:40:20,124 --> 00:40:21,625
No.

00:40:21,692 --> 00:40:23,994
So now, we're going
to try the opening.

00:40:24,061 --> 00:40:25,362
And I want you to swab

00:40:25,429 --> 00:40:28,098
right here
underneath the lip.

00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,802
Great.

00:40:38,876 --> 00:40:40,577
SIMMS:
<i>Looks like our killer</i>
<i>caught his thumb</i>

00:40:40,644 --> 00:40:42,313
<i>when he was loading the weapon.</i>

00:41:00,798 --> 00:41:03,300
LANGSTON:
<i>The fight doctor</i>
<i>is wanted on a long list</i>

00:41:03,367 --> 00:41:05,536
<i>of open trafficking</i>
<i>indictments.</i>

00:41:05,602 --> 00:41:07,604
<i>And Interpol's been</i>
<i>after him for years.</i>

00:41:07,671 --> 00:41:10,107
<i>We believe he's the one</i>
<i>who shot Rio.</i>

00:41:26,991 --> 00:41:29,526
It's over, Miles.

00:41:29,593 --> 00:41:32,696
It was the doctor posing
as Os Punho.

00:41:32,763 --> 00:41:35,165
He was running
the operation the whole time.

00:41:36,533 --> 00:41:40,304
A fake cop taking down
an imaginary villain.

00:41:40,371 --> 00:41:42,406
Not imaginary.

00:41:42,473 --> 00:41:44,708
The suffering,
the death he caused, was real.

00:41:44,775 --> 00:41:46,377
And you put a stop to it.

00:41:49,813 --> 00:41:51,348
I did?

00:41:51,415 --> 00:41:52,816
He's in jail.

00:41:52,883 --> 00:41:54,318
I don't believe
he'll ever get out.

00:41:55,919 --> 00:41:58,055
That's good.

00:41:58,122 --> 00:42:02,393
I brought you something
to pass the time.

00:42:10,768 --> 00:42:12,503
As I recall...

00:42:14,271 --> 00:42:17,675
Quixote regained his sanity
in the end.

00:42:17,741 --> 00:42:21,745
But his melancholia persisted.

00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:28,052
He died emotionally broken
and alone.

00:42:28,118 --> 00:42:29,887
Well, they didn't have
antidepressants

00:42:29,953 --> 00:42:31,455
back in those days.

00:42:42,333 --> 00:42:43,901
Chapter one.

00:42:43,968 --> 00:42:47,905
<i>"At a village of La Mancha,</i>

00:42:47,972 --> 00:42:50,307
<i>"whose name I do not wish</i>
<i>to remember,</i>

00:42:50,374 --> 00:42:52,409
<i>"there lived</i>

00:42:52,476 --> 00:42:54,478

00:42:57,348 --> 00:43:00,317
<i>"an old buckler, a lean horse</i>

00:43:00,384 --> 00:43:01,919
<i>and a swift greyhound."</i>

00:43:07,992 --> 00:43:11,729
they really were giants.
