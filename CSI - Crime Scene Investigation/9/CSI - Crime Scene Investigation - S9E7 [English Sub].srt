in a homicide
about 12 years ago,

00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,277

for a long time.

00:08:59,812 --> 00:09:01,381
But, uh,
you must know who he is

00:09:01,447 --> 00:09:04,450
because according to these
fingerprints, he's you.

00:09:04,517 --> 00:09:06,252
Changing your name
is not a crime.

00:09:06,319 --> 00:09:07,453

No, it's not.

00:09:08,521 --> 00:09:11,090
But let me tell you what is.

00:09:11,157 --> 00:09:13,059
Your first wife Amy hired
a private investigator

00:09:13,126 --> 00:09:14,894
named Trevor Murphy
to find out

00:09:14,961 --> 00:09:16,129
if you were cheating
on her.

00:09:16,195 --> 00:09:17,463
Of course, you were.
Isn't that right,

00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:18,898
Mark, Peter?

00:09:18,965 --> 00:09:20,566
Which do you prefer?

00:09:20,633 --> 00:09:23,102
So, anyway, this
private investigator Murphy--

00:09:23,169 --> 00:09:25,538
he proved Amy was right,

00:09:25,605 --> 00:09:29,175
and she was, uh, disappointed,

00:09:29,242 --> 00:09:33,579
so he consoled her, you know,
in her time of need.

00:09:33,646 --> 00:09:37,183
He comforted her
in the biblical sense,

00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,418
and you found out

00:09:38,484 --> 00:09:39,552
about it,

00:09:39,619 --> 00:09:41,087
and then Murphy was no more.

00:09:41,154 --> 00:09:44,791
His car was found abandoned
at a gas station in the desert,

00:09:44,857 --> 00:09:46,426
and you were
the prime suspect.

00:09:46,492 --> 00:09:48,261
I was never even charged.
That's because
Trevor Murphy's body

00:09:48,327 --> 00:09:49,796
was never found.
Maybe that's

00:09:49,862 --> 00:09:50,863
because he's not dead,

00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:52,231
which is what I told
the cops back then.

00:09:52,298 --> 00:09:53,266
I didn't kill anybody.

00:09:53,332 --> 00:09:54,267
Okay?
Yeah, but...

00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:56,803
bodies keep piling up
around you.

00:09:56,869 --> 00:09:57,804

00:10:13,586 --> 00:10:14,554
"You will rot like Trevor rots.

00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,788
I will watch."

00:10:15,855 --> 00:10:17,523
I've been getting stuff
like this for months.

00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:19,592
Whoever killed
Janelle...

00:10:19,659 --> 00:10:24,230
I think they,
they were gunning for me.

00:10:28,468 --> 00:10:30,670
Driver's C.O.D. is
subdural hematoma as a result

00:10:30,737 --> 00:10:33,439
of injuries sustained
in the crash.

00:10:33,506 --> 00:10:35,742
Same deal with his
buddy, more or less.

00:10:35,808 --> 00:10:37,443
Multiple skull
fractures consistent

00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:40,179
with flying face-first
through a windshield.

00:10:40,246 --> 00:10:42,749
C.O.D here is atlanto-
occipital dislocation.

00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:46,018
So his skull just separated
from his spine?

00:10:46,085 --> 00:10:47,387
Yeah.

00:10:47,453 --> 00:10:48,554
Well, at least
it was quick.

00:10:48,621 --> 00:10:50,223
Thanks, Doc.
Whoa, whoa, hold
your horses.

00:10:50,289 --> 00:10:52,258
There's something
you should see.

00:10:52,325 --> 00:10:55,061
About that shoulder
wound you found,

00:10:55,128 --> 00:10:57,597
I found a cluster of related
injuries on the right arm--

00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:01,200
fractured right
distal humerus,

00:11:01,267 --> 00:11:03,269
dislocated shoulder,
and torn rotator cuff.

00:11:03,336 --> 00:11:05,972
Come here.

00:11:08,007 --> 00:11:09,942
The direction of
applied force in a break

00:11:10,009 --> 00:11:12,045
is indicated by the
fracture plateau.

00:11:12,111 --> 00:11:14,080
That's the flat section
of bone at the break.

00:11:14,147 --> 00:11:15,314
The arm
must have been hanging

00:11:15,381 --> 00:11:17,984
outside the car
something like this.

00:11:18,051 --> 00:11:22,088
<i>In this case, it indicates that</i>
<i>something bent the arm back,</i>

00:11:22,155 --> 00:11:23,923
<i>snapping it</i>
<i>on the backside of the elbow,</i>

00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:26,125
<i>which in turn caused</i>
<i>chain reaction injuries</i>

00:11:26,192 --> 00:11:28,294
<i>to the rotator cuff</i>
<i>and shoulder.</i>

00:11:28,361 --> 00:11:30,830
That's an unusual injury
for a head-on collision.

00:11:30,897 --> 00:11:32,965
Could have injured it
before the crash?

00:11:33,032 --> 00:11:34,634
I don't think so.
Bruising doesn't suggest that

00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:37,070
and all the wounds
are perimortem.

00:11:37,136 --> 00:11:38,604
Well, maybe
the arm

00:11:38,671 --> 00:11:40,273
just broke itself.

00:11:40,339 --> 00:11:41,908
That'd be
a first.

00:11:41,974 --> 00:11:43,876
Thanks.

00:11:57,957 --> 00:11:59,826
(clock ticking)

STOKES:
<i>The EDR records vehicle data</i>

00:13:00,751 --> 00:13:04,111
for about five seconds prior
to the airbag's deployment.

00:13:04,111 --> 00:13:06,614
This indicates
that the antilock brakes

00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,983
activated four seconds
before impact.

00:13:09,049 --> 00:13:11,318
Sounds like the car
lost traction.

00:13:11,385 --> 00:13:12,453
Hmm.

00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,587
Was it wet?

00:13:13,654 --> 00:13:14,889
Nope.

00:13:14,955 --> 00:13:16,424
Was there oil?
No.

00:13:19,093 --> 00:13:20,261
(computer beeping)

00:13:24,498 --> 00:13:25,633
STOKES:
According to the data,

00:13:25,699 --> 00:13:27,635
looks like the driver
veered right

00:13:27,701 --> 00:13:29,870
and then overcompensated left.

00:13:29,937 --> 00:13:31,872
If the car veered
onto the shoulder,

00:13:31,939 --> 00:13:33,407
then one tire is
on the asphalt.

00:13:33,474 --> 00:13:34,975
The other one's spinning
in the gravel,

00:13:35,042 --> 00:13:37,378
which would activate
the ABS, and...

00:13:37,445 --> 00:13:40,514
you did find this gravel
in the soft top, right?

00:13:40,581 --> 00:13:42,416
Mm-hmm.

00:13:44,452 --> 00:13:45,786
But you do not

00:13:45,853 --> 00:13:47,421
appear to be convinced.

00:13:47,488 --> 00:13:51,725
The shoulder was undisturbed
at the scene.

00:13:51,792 --> 00:13:55,229
We're still missing
something there, Colombo.

00:13:58,733 --> 00:14:01,135
Logged onto Facebook
lately, Doc?

00:14:01,202 --> 00:14:02,603
I've been a little busy.

00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:03,604
That's too bad.

00:14:03,671 --> 00:14:05,206
I just schooled
you in Logolous.

00:14:05,272 --> 00:14:07,108
I played "quilt" across.

00:14:07,174 --> 00:14:09,310
The "T" made
"ire" into "tire"

00:14:09,376 --> 00:14:10,478
on a double word score.

00:14:10,544 --> 00:14:11,712
36 points.

00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:14,448
Very impressive.

00:14:14,515 --> 00:14:16,417
You want COD
on Janelle Rowe?

00:14:16,484 --> 00:14:18,285
Bullet to the head?

00:14:18,352 --> 00:14:20,855
Exsanguination from transection
of the jugular

00:14:20,921 --> 00:14:23,491
by a .38 caliber round,
if you please.

00:14:24,525 --> 00:14:25,893
And I bet
there's something

00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,995
you don't know.

00:14:28,062 --> 00:14:30,965
This bruise was inflicted
perimortem.

00:14:31,031 --> 00:14:32,500
Looks like a gun sight.

00:14:32,566 --> 00:14:34,268
Maybe she was pistol-whipped.

00:14:34,335 --> 00:14:35,302
(grunting)

00:14:35,369 --> 00:14:37,304
Certainly
a possibility.

00:14:37,371 --> 00:14:38,305
Is that it?

00:14:38,372 --> 00:14:40,741
Yeah... oh, oh,
I'm almost forgot.

00:14:40,808 --> 00:14:43,511
I played "quartz" off your "Q"

00:14:43,577 --> 00:14:45,946
with a triple-word score
of 72 points.

00:14:47,982 --> 00:14:49,517
So much for youth
and enthusiasm.

00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,986
I look forward
to old age and treachery.

00:14:56,023 --> 00:14:57,525
BRASS:
Thanks for coming in,
Ms. Murphy.

00:14:57,591 --> 00:14:58,859
Thank you.

00:14:58,926 --> 00:15:00,728
You said this
was about my father.

00:15:00,795 --> 00:15:02,363
Did you find his body?

00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:03,798
Unfortunately, no.

00:15:03,864 --> 00:15:05,533
No, this is about a...

00:15:05,599 --> 00:15:07,701
a murder suspect
we have in custody.

00:15:07,768 --> 00:15:09,236
His name is Mark Redding.

00:15:11,872 --> 00:15:14,708
Wacky guess:
he says he's innocent.

00:15:16,377 --> 00:15:18,512
You know, I remember you

00:15:18,579 --> 00:15:22,349
from when my father
went missing.

00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:24,485
You bought me a soda
in the waiting room.

00:15:24,552 --> 00:15:25,820
You were really nice to me.

00:15:25,886 --> 00:15:28,489
Well, I'm glad I was able
to help a little.

00:15:30,491 --> 00:15:32,359
You don't remember.

00:15:34,962 --> 00:15:37,131
I wish I could forget.

00:15:38,966 --> 00:15:41,102
What does this
have to do with me?

00:15:41,168 --> 00:15:42,670
Uh, about nine
years ago,

00:15:42,737 --> 00:15:45,272
uh, Mark Redding
changed his name to Peter Rowe.

00:15:45,339 --> 00:15:46,674
He said he did it

00:15:46,741 --> 00:15:48,743
because he felt like there
was a target on his back.

00:15:48,809 --> 00:15:50,878
Couple of
months ago,

00:15:50,945 --> 00:15:53,013
he started to get
death threats

00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,417
from anonymous e-mails,

00:15:56,484 --> 00:15:58,753
and all those e-mails
mentioned your father.

00:15:58,819 --> 00:16:00,788
My dad had a lot
of angry friends.

00:16:00,855 --> 00:16:02,923
Well, the e-mails
were sent

00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:06,727
from an account that was set up
on your IP address.

00:16:06,794 --> 00:16:08,229
You think I wrote them?

00:16:08,295 --> 00:16:10,531
It's a wacky guess-- did you?

00:16:10,598 --> 00:16:11,832
Of course not.

00:16:11,899 --> 00:16:14,535
He probably sent them
to himself.

00:16:14,602 --> 00:16:16,637
Do you mind if I ask you
where you were last night?

00:16:16,704 --> 00:16:18,472
Do you mind
if my lawyer answers?

00:16:18,539 --> 00:16:22,410
You guys
are unbelievable.

00:16:22,476 --> 00:16:23,811
Uh, Ms. Murphy.

00:16:23,878 --> 00:16:25,613
(sighs)

00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:27,648
We have a warrant
for your computer.

00:16:27,715 --> 00:16:30,518
(sighs)

00:16:30,584 --> 00:16:31,852
Knock yourself out.

00:16:32,887 --> 00:16:35,289
My dad has been dead
for a long time.

00:16:35,356 --> 00:16:37,992
All I want to do
is get on with my life.

00:16:38,058 --> 00:16:39,527
Just leave me alone.

00:16:40,895 --> 00:16:43,130
JOHNSON:
The pink cell phone
belonged to Nora Rowe.

00:16:43,197 --> 00:16:44,965
Maybe the killer took it.

00:16:45,032 --> 00:16:46,934
SANDERS:
Why would the killer
take a kid's cell phone

00:16:47,001 --> 00:16:49,036
and then ditch it
less than a block away?

00:16:49,103 --> 00:16:50,971
Probably thought
they trashed it.

00:16:51,038 --> 00:16:54,675
Most people don't realize how
tough these memory cards are.

00:16:54,742 --> 00:16:56,510
Look at this.

00:16:57,845 --> 00:16:59,346
Most of these pictures
were taken

00:16:59,413 --> 00:17:00,915
within two hours of the murder.

00:17:00,981 --> 00:17:02,116
Hold it.

00:17:02,183 --> 00:17:04,018
That's Janelle Rowe's kitchen,

00:17:04,085 --> 00:17:06,387
taken right around the
time of the shooting.

00:17:07,354 --> 00:17:08,689
You know, the
neighbor said

00:17:08,756 --> 00:17:11,192
that she saw a muzzle flash
when she heard the gunshot,

00:17:11,258 --> 00:17:13,127
but what if it
was a camera flash?

00:17:13,194 --> 00:17:14,662
(Touch-Tone dialing)

00:17:14,729 --> 00:17:15,930
(clicking)
No, get away...

00:17:15,996 --> 00:17:19,266
I bet the killer thought
his face was in that photo.

00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:21,502
Got Ballistics
on Peter Rowe's gun.

00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:22,870
It's not the murder weapon.

00:17:22,937 --> 00:17:25,239
No IBIS hits
on it, either.

00:17:25,306 --> 00:17:27,241
Well, I'm gonna go
out on a limb here

00:17:27,308 --> 00:17:28,476
and say he
didn't do it.

00:17:28,542 --> 00:17:30,945
SANDERS:
Okay... you know,
let's say

00:17:31,011 --> 00:17:32,446
he was telling the truth,

00:17:32,513 --> 00:17:35,116
that someone blamed him
for the death of Trevor Murphy,

00:17:35,182 --> 00:17:36,817
and his wife and daughter
got caught up

00:17:36,884 --> 00:17:38,119
in the revenge.

00:17:38,185 --> 00:17:40,387
So, the death threats
were more than just threats.

00:17:42,356 --> 00:17:44,925
So, let's find out
who really sent those e-mails.

00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,828
HODGES:
On the left, the exemplars

00:17:47,895 --> 00:17:49,964
from the aspen tree
found at the crime scene.

00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,198
On the right,

00:17:51,265 --> 00:17:53,667
the splinters from the
passenger's shoulder wound.

00:17:53,734 --> 00:17:55,302
WILLOWS:
They're different.

00:17:55,369 --> 00:17:57,772
Whatever stabbed him,
it wasn't that tree.

00:17:57,838 --> 00:18:00,708
It was, uh, treated
hardwood and white ash,

00:18:00,775 --> 00:18:02,977
known for its durable
bending quality

00:18:03,043 --> 00:18:04,378
and hardness.

00:18:04,445 --> 00:18:06,714
Not unlike me.

00:18:07,748 --> 00:18:08,749
You didn't learn anything

00:18:08,816 --> 00:18:10,217
in sensitivity training,
did you?

00:18:10,284 --> 00:18:12,820
I took what I needed,
and I left the rest.

00:18:12,887 --> 00:18:14,054
Where would you
find white ash?

00:18:14,121 --> 00:18:15,923
It's found in
long handles,

00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:19,393
such as garden rakes,
spades, shovels.

00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:22,329
And it's also found
in some baseball bats,

00:18:22,396 --> 00:18:25,566
because it's a lighter
wood with a long grain.

00:18:25,633 --> 00:18:27,234
Mailbox baseball.

00:18:29,303 --> 00:18:32,073
These guys were playing
mailbox baseball.

00:18:32,139 --> 00:18:34,108
Yeah, that
would explain the...

00:18:34,175 --> 00:18:36,944
the weird fracture
to his right arm.

00:18:37,011 --> 00:18:37,945
(man whooping)

00:18:38,012 --> 00:18:39,346
Yeah, right there, right there!

00:18:39,413 --> 00:18:40,681
(smashing mailbox)

00:18:40,748 --> 00:18:42,016
(laughter and whooping)

00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:43,384
You're serious.

00:18:43,451 --> 00:18:44,952
Oh, yeah, I'm dead serious.

00:18:45,019 --> 00:18:46,620
It's really fun.

00:18:49,924 --> 00:18:53,294
When you're a bored teenager
who's feeling destructive.

00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:58,766
If you knock the box
cleanly off its post,

00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:00,301
then it's a home run.

00:19:00,367 --> 00:19:03,237
Everything else,
just a base hit.

00:19:04,705 --> 00:19:06,240
That's pathetic.

00:19:06,307 --> 00:19:07,708
Actually, it's awesome.

00:19:07,775 --> 00:19:08,909
It's a release.

00:19:08,976 --> 00:19:10,578
You know, in
high school,

00:19:10,644 --> 00:19:14,215
in chem club, I once painted
iodide of beryllium

00:19:14,281 --> 00:19:16,584
on the inside
of my best friend's desk drawer,

00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:19,153
let it dry overnight,
so when he opened up

00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,621
the drawer the
next morning,

00:19:20,688 --> 00:19:21,989
he got this-- pa!--
explosion

00:19:22,056 --> 00:19:23,691
of pink powder
in his face.

00:19:23,758 --> 00:19:24,992
(chuckling)

00:19:25,059 --> 00:19:25,993
For no reason.

00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,261
WILLOWS:
Well, this is all

00:19:27,328 --> 00:19:29,397
very fascinating
and really quite sad,

00:19:29,463 --> 00:19:32,299
and while it might explain
the roots of violent crime,

00:19:32,366 --> 00:19:33,768
it doesn't explain
why you didn't find

00:19:33,834 --> 00:19:36,303
a bat at the scene
or how a mailbox

00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:38,272
full of air
could shatter an arm.

00:19:38,339 --> 00:19:41,008
Recess is over.

00:19:41,075 --> 00:19:42,076
(chuckles) And it...

00:19:42,143 --> 00:19:43,844
Did it go in his mouth?
Oh, yeah.

00:19:43,911 --> 00:19:45,713
Went in his mouth-- he was
walking around school

00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,448
like a lizard, like...

00:19:50,518 --> 00:19:52,119
NICHOLS:
<i>Natalie Davis.</i>

00:19:52,186 --> 00:19:54,288
<i>You're a serial killer.</i>

00:19:54,355 --> 00:19:57,124
<i>You crushed the skull</i>
<i>of a rock star</i>

00:19:57,191 --> 00:19:59,760
<i>while he was eating breakfast.</i>

00:19:59,827 --> 00:20:01,929
<i>You poisoned an elderly woman,</i>
<i>whose convulsions</i>

00:20:01,996 --> 00:20:03,631
<i>sent her flailing</i>
<i>through a window.</i>

00:20:03,697 --> 00:20:05,266
(door buzzes, then opens)

00:20:05,332 --> 00:20:09,070
<i>You electrocuted a janitor</i>
<i>at a chicken slaughterhouse.</i>

00:20:09,136 --> 00:20:11,305
<i>You gassed an undercover cop.</i>

00:20:11,372 --> 00:20:13,407
<i>And when your foster father,</i>

00:20:13,474 --> 00:20:15,609
<i>in an attempt to protect you,</i>
<i>confessed to your</i>

00:20:15,676 --> 00:20:17,645
<i>crime in a video suicide,</i>

00:20:17,711 --> 00:20:20,614
<i>you kidnapped</i>
<i>a CSI and trapped her</i>

00:20:20,681 --> 00:20:22,750
<i>under a car,</i>
<i>alone, in the desert,</i>

00:20:22,817 --> 00:20:25,619
<i>and left her to die there.</i>

00:20:25,686 --> 00:20:27,021
You were captured
and you were tried

00:20:27,088 --> 00:20:29,590
by a jury of your peers
in a court of law.

00:20:29,657 --> 00:20:32,760
What was the verdict?

00:20:32,827 --> 00:20:36,097
I was found guilty,
but mentally ill.

00:20:36,163 --> 00:20:38,032
And what does
that mean?

00:20:38,099 --> 00:20:39,934
It means that
when I committed my crimes,

00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,136
I knew that what I was
doing was wrong.

00:20:42,203 --> 00:20:43,871
But after
I was arrested,

00:20:43,938 --> 00:20:45,773
I suffered
a psychotic breakdown.

00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,808
You were
diagnosed with

00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:50,010
catatonic schizophrenia.

00:20:51,011 --> 00:20:53,314
You don't seem
catatonic now.

00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,449
I'm taking medications
that make it go away.

00:20:55,516 --> 00:20:57,251
And how do you feel?

00:20:57,318 --> 00:20:58,719
I feel like I used to.

00:20:58,786 --> 00:21:00,287
Normal.

00:21:01,322 --> 00:21:02,723
And that is why

00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:04,291
you no longer need
to be treated

00:21:04,358 --> 00:21:06,660
in this psychiatric
facility.

00:21:06,727 --> 00:21:08,729
You are well enough
to serve the sentence

00:21:08,796 --> 00:21:11,365
that you were lawfully given.

00:21:11,432 --> 00:21:12,900
You're not mentally ill.

00:21:12,967 --> 00:21:14,735
Not anymore.

00:21:14,802 --> 00:21:16,804
You're just guilty.

00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:37,888
WILSON:
I put Ms. Davis
on Risperidone to treat

00:21:37,955 --> 00:21:39,056
the catatonic schizophrenia.

00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:41,760
I'm quite pleased
with the results.

00:21:41,827 --> 00:21:42,828
How are you treating

00:21:42,894 --> 00:21:44,963
her psychopathic
compulsion to kill?

00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:46,698
We're not really.
She's on a couple

00:21:46,765 --> 00:21:48,500
of anti-O.C.D. meds, but...
Isn't it true that

00:21:48,567 --> 00:21:50,302
as the catatonia lifts,
her psychopathic

00:21:50,368 --> 00:21:52,704
tendencies will eventually
reassert themselves?

00:21:52,771 --> 00:21:54,406
It's certainly possible.

00:21:55,941 --> 00:21:58,910
That's because Natalie Davis
has an incurable disease.

00:21:58,977 --> 00:22:01,246
Do we imprison
people with M.S.?
With cancer?

00:22:01,313 --> 00:22:02,981
She is not

00:22:03,048 --> 00:22:04,216
responsible
for her actions.

00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:05,684
She needs help.

00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,485
She needs to remain here.

00:22:07,552 --> 00:22:08,820
Thank you, Counsel.

00:22:08,887 --> 00:22:11,723
These proceedings will resume
at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow.

00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:14,192
Until then,
we're adjourned.

00:22:14,259 --> 00:22:15,927
(gavel bangs)

00:22:19,231 --> 00:22:21,399
(door buzzes, then opens)

00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:26,705
Come on.

00:22:26,771 --> 00:22:28,640
NICHOLS (sighing):
Dr. Grissom.

00:22:28,707 --> 00:22:29,875
Miss Nichols.

00:22:29,941 --> 00:22:31,076
Glad to see you.

00:22:31,142 --> 00:22:32,577
Is Sara coming, too?

00:22:32,644 --> 00:22:34,479
I'm afraid
she's not available.

00:22:34,546 --> 00:22:37,749
I see. You know, Gil, you were
the only person in the room

00:22:37,816 --> 00:22:39,251
when Natalie had
her psychotic break.

00:22:39,317 --> 00:22:40,752
It would really help me out

00:22:40,819 --> 00:22:42,487
if you'd get up there
and testify.

00:22:42,554 --> 00:22:44,890
I can't render an opinion
to her mental state.

00:22:44,956 --> 00:22:47,058
I'm not a psychiatrist
<i>or</i> a psychologist.

00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:48,326
I'd call you

00:22:48,393 --> 00:22:49,895
as a percipient witness.

00:22:49,961 --> 00:22:51,229
You'd only have to testify

00:22:51,296 --> 00:22:53,431
about what you observed
with your own eyes.

00:22:53,498 --> 00:22:55,800
How she was then,
and how she is now.

00:22:55,867 --> 00:22:59,037
I can arrange a
meeting with Natalie.

00:22:59,104 --> 00:23:01,039
Okay.

00:23:01,106 --> 00:23:02,841
I would like to see her.

00:23:02,908 --> 00:23:05,143
ADAMS:
<i>Archie located</i>

00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:07,579
the e-mail server that sent
death threats to Peter Rowe.

00:23:07,646 --> 00:23:09,781
I thought they were sent
from Kelsey Murphy's house.

00:23:09,848 --> 00:23:12,150
The e-mail <i>account</i>
was created there.

00:23:12,217 --> 00:23:15,053
The e-mails themselves came
from a halfway house downtown.

00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,155
Oh. I assume
Brass is checking it out?

00:23:17,222 --> 00:23:19,624
Definitely. I had them
fax over a resident list.

00:23:19,691 --> 00:23:22,494
One of the names
jumped off the page.

00:23:22,561 --> 00:23:24,262
Nathan Murphy?

00:23:24,329 --> 00:23:26,264
Kelsey has a brother.

00:23:26,331 --> 00:23:28,366
BRASS:
Making death threats
is a felony, Nathan.

00:23:28,433 --> 00:23:30,268
So I go to jail for that

00:23:30,335 --> 00:23:33,004
while Mark Redding gets
to walk for murder?

00:23:33,071 --> 00:23:35,574
He's only a murderer
according to you.

00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,175
How'd you find him?

00:23:37,242 --> 00:23:38,643
My dad was a P.I.

00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:41,313
And the Internet's
a beautiful thing.

00:23:41,379 --> 00:23:42,480
Right.

00:23:42,547 --> 00:23:43,715
Why should Mark
Redding live happily

00:23:43,782 --> 00:23:45,250
after what he did?

00:23:45,317 --> 00:23:48,553
New name, new wife, new life?

00:23:49,821 --> 00:23:51,223
(sighs)

00:23:51,289 --> 00:23:52,524
It makes me sick.

00:23:52,591 --> 00:23:54,226
I wanted him looking

00:23:54,292 --> 00:23:56,261
over his shoulder at night,
feeling afraid.

00:23:56,328 --> 00:23:58,396
KELSEY:
<i>I gave Nathan</i>

00:23:58,463 --> 00:23:59,998
my old laptop
six months ago.

00:24:00,065 --> 00:24:02,367
He was staying with me
for a few days,

00:24:02,434 --> 00:24:04,503
and that's when
he set up the account.

00:24:04,569 --> 00:24:06,171
That's why it traced to me.

00:24:06,238 --> 00:24:08,507
So, why didn't you mention that
earlier?

00:24:08,573 --> 00:24:10,575
He's my brother.

00:24:10,642 --> 00:24:12,744
I wanted to protect him.

00:24:12,811 --> 00:24:14,946
So you two are close?

00:24:15,013 --> 00:24:18,183
Not anymore.

00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:20,118
Why is that?
(sighs)

00:24:20,185 --> 00:24:24,189
When we're in a room together,
he doesn't see me.

00:24:24,256 --> 00:24:26,391
He only sees Dad.

00:24:26,458 --> 00:24:28,894
Somebody had to remind
Mark Redding what he did.

00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,897
Did you do anything
other than write e-mails?

00:24:31,963 --> 00:24:35,033
I wanted to kill him.

00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,502
I think about it every day.

00:24:40,138 --> 00:24:43,208
If anyone had ever laid a hand
on me or my sister

00:24:43,275 --> 00:24:45,277
while my dad was alive,

00:24:45,343 --> 00:24:49,681
he would have laid them down
like dogs.

00:24:49,748 --> 00:24:52,083
If my dad saw me now...

00:24:54,186 --> 00:24:57,455
...letting the scumbag
that killed him breathe air

00:24:57,522 --> 00:24:59,658
for nine more years...

00:25:01,726 --> 00:25:04,029
...he'd spit on me.

00:25:06,631 --> 00:25:09,301
His son should have
been stronger.

00:25:09,367 --> 00:25:11,469
Where were you last night
between 8:00 and 10:00?

00:25:11,536 --> 00:25:13,405
(sniffles)
On the strip alone.

00:25:13,471 --> 00:25:14,639
Come on.

00:25:14,706 --> 00:25:15,841
Come on, Nathan.

00:25:15,907 --> 00:25:17,676
You got to do better than that.

00:25:17,742 --> 00:25:19,578
Why?

00:25:19,644 --> 00:25:21,479
Because Mark Redding's wife
was murdered last night,

00:25:21,546 --> 00:25:22,914
and his daughter is hanging on

00:25:22,981 --> 00:25:25,684
by a thread at Desert Palm
Hospital, that's why.

00:25:27,485 --> 00:25:29,554
(sighs)

00:25:29,621 --> 00:25:31,990
I want my phone call
and a lawyer.

Yes!

00:25:41,266 --> 00:25:42,367
Nicky! For God's sakes!

00:25:42,434 --> 00:25:44,035
Are you trying
to break your arm?

00:25:44,102 --> 00:25:48,473
Oh, no. Don't sweat it. I
tried it on the dummy first.

00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:51,376

STOKES:
If it didn't break his arm,
it's not gonna break mine.

00:25:51,443 --> 00:25:53,678
HODGES:
It became clear
during our experiments

00:25:53,745 --> 00:25:55,780
that it would take something
far more massive

00:25:55,847 --> 00:25:57,082
than an aluminum mailbox

00:25:57,148 --> 00:25:59,451
to generate the force necessary
to cause the fracture

00:25:59,518 --> 00:26:01,419
of the victim's arm.

00:26:01,486 --> 00:26:02,854
STOKES:
We're thinking telephone
pole, sign post.

00:26:02,921 --> 00:26:04,289
I want to go back out

to the crime scene,
check it out.

00:26:06,057 --> 00:26:08,960
Then why are you guys still
in here smashing mailboxes?

00:26:09,027 --> 00:26:11,196
Because it's
fun. My turn.

00:26:11,263 --> 00:26:13,498
STOKES:
I'm gonna go a
little bit faster

00:26:13,565 --> 00:26:14,833
than you did last time.

00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,268
HODGES:
Please go faster...

00:26:16,334 --> 00:26:18,270
And I wonder
why I'm still single.

Yeah. Well, we could get
a warrant, Mr. Jackmin,

00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:19,591
Why is that?

00:28:19,658 --> 00:28:20,759
Uh, old one
got smashed

00:28:20,826 --> 00:28:21,960
a while back.

00:28:22,027 --> 00:28:23,161
You know, kids.

00:28:23,228 --> 00:28:25,797
I figured it was cheaper
to take it down every night

00:28:25,864 --> 00:28:27,632
than to keep on,
uh, replacing it.

00:28:27,699 --> 00:28:28,800
Kids, huh?

00:28:28,867 --> 00:28:30,769
Yeah.

00:28:30,836 --> 00:28:32,137
Did you do it yourself?

00:28:32,204 --> 00:28:34,639
I'm a do-it-yourself
kind of guy.

00:28:36,208 --> 00:28:37,609
It's a nice walkway.

00:28:37,676 --> 00:28:39,377
Thanks.

00:28:41,646 --> 00:28:44,282
This looks new.

00:28:48,753 --> 00:28:50,188
(distant cow lowing)

00:28:56,194 --> 00:28:58,196
Charlie, give me
a hand, will you?

00:29:09,007 --> 00:29:12,043
What is this?

00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:14,646
A concrete-filled decoy?

00:29:14,713 --> 00:29:18,016
Man, you really taught
those boys a lesson, huh?

00:29:18,083 --> 00:29:19,284
(whooping)

00:29:19,351 --> 00:29:22,354
(yelling, tires squealing)

00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,422
Four times those kids
trashed my mailbox.

00:29:24,489 --> 00:29:26,458
Four times!
STOKES:
Yeah, there's a better way

00:29:26,525 --> 00:29:28,560
to handle it.
Weren't you ever a kid?

00:29:28,627 --> 00:29:29,728
'Course I was.

00:29:29,794 --> 00:29:31,997
If I met myself now
the way I was then,

00:29:32,063 --> 00:29:33,365
I'd kick my snotty nose ass.

00:29:33,431 --> 00:29:36,067
I didn't mean
to hurt those people.

00:29:36,134 --> 00:29:38,170
I heard the crash,
I went out there.

00:29:38,236 --> 00:29:41,239
<i>There was nothing</i>
<i>I could do for them.</i>

00:29:41,306 --> 00:29:43,475
Oh, no.

00:29:43,542 --> 00:29:47,179
STOKES:
<i>No, but you could still</i>
<i>do something for yourself, huh?</i>

00:29:50,615 --> 00:29:52,617
(panting)

00:29:55,153 --> 00:29:57,489
(grunting)

00:30:03,361 --> 00:30:04,896
What was I supposed to do?

00:30:04,963 --> 00:30:08,033
Just roll over and let them
keep on doing it to me?

00:30:08,099 --> 00:30:09,568
STOKES:
You could have
done something else.

00:30:09,634 --> 00:30:11,236
Use cinderblocks,
set up a camera

00:30:11,303 --> 00:30:13,271
to get their license plate,
but this?

00:30:13,338 --> 00:30:15,106
I didn't make them smash
that mailbox.

00:30:15,173 --> 00:30:16,408
No.

00:30:16,474 --> 00:30:18,777
But I bet you were hoping
they would, huh?

00:30:18,844 --> 00:30:20,111
(garbled radio transmission)

00:30:20,178 --> 00:30:22,113
STOKES:
Mr. Jackmin,
you're under arrest

00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:24,182
for two counts of
negligent homicide.

00:30:30,455 --> 00:30:33,391
(washing machines and dryers
running)

00:30:33,458 --> 00:30:34,793
(door slamming)

00:30:46,104 --> 00:30:47,472
Hello, Natalie.

00:30:47,539 --> 00:30:49,541
Hello.

00:30:51,443 --> 00:30:53,678
I wasn't surprised
to see you yesterday.

00:30:53,745 --> 00:30:56,581
You weren't?

00:30:56,648 --> 00:30:58,950
You want to make
sure I go to jail.

00:30:59,017 --> 00:31:00,952
I understand that.

00:31:01,019 --> 00:31:04,389
People who do bad things
need to be punished.

00:31:06,491 --> 00:31:08,827
Well, I think you're
already being punished.

00:31:08,894 --> 00:31:10,829
Then why did you come here?

00:31:10,896 --> 00:31:12,330
The only time
I ever saw you,

00:31:12,397 --> 00:31:15,200
you weren't yourself.

00:31:15,267 --> 00:31:18,003
I wanted to see the person
you really are.

00:31:18,069 --> 00:31:21,139
Well... here I am.

00:31:27,112 --> 00:31:30,115
Is Sara gonna speak
at the hearing, too?

00:31:30,182 --> 00:31:31,783
No.

00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:34,653
She doesn't work
with us anymore.

00:31:34,719 --> 00:31:37,289
Because of what I did to her.

00:31:37,355 --> 00:31:40,659
I don't know.

00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,902
Occupational therapy?

00:31:50,969 --> 00:31:52,971
By working

00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:56,741
with the thing I fear the most,
I diminish its power.

00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,350
I'm very sorry for
what I did to Sara.

00:32:06,685 --> 00:32:08,587
And to you.

00:32:08,653 --> 00:32:10,989
My foster father

00:32:11,056 --> 00:32:13,892
killed himself because of me.

00:32:13,959 --> 00:32:17,195
I was wrong
to blame anybody else for it.

00:32:20,532 --> 00:32:22,567
Is that how you really feel,

00:32:22,634 --> 00:32:26,004
or is that how
you think you should feel?

00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:32,511
I understand
if you don't believe me.

00:32:32,577 --> 00:32:36,781
Psychopathic personalities
are very often skilled

00:32:36,848 --> 00:32:38,950
at mimicking genuine emotion.

00:32:41,386 --> 00:32:43,822
But I'm truly sorry.

00:32:52,922 --> 00:32:54,356
A year before Trevor Murphy
disappeared,

00:32:54,423 --> 00:32:56,425
he was staking out a liquor
store for a client.

00:32:56,492 --> 00:32:58,260
One night the joint
gets robbed,

00:32:58,327 --> 00:33:00,396
Trevor storms in and drops
the suspect with one shot

00:33:00,463 --> 00:33:02,331
It's pretty ballsy
for a P.I..
Yeah.

00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:04,166
Well, the bullet was
still in evidence.

00:33:04,233 --> 00:33:06,669
So, I compared it to the bullet
that killed Janelle Rowe.

00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:08,204
Ballistics confirms
they're both

00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:10,206
fired from the same weapon,
a .38 Special.

00:33:10,272 --> 00:33:11,574
It's not uncommon

00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,576
for a killer to keep
his victim's gun.

00:33:13,642 --> 00:33:16,579
What if Kelsey and
Nathan are right?

00:33:16,645 --> 00:33:19,081
Peter Rowe killed
their father,

00:33:19,148 --> 00:33:21,083
used Trevor's own
gun to do it.

00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:22,251
I'll call Brass.

00:33:22,318 --> 00:33:24,253
We'll bring Peter
back in.

00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,387
NICHOLS:
<i>Dr. Grissom,</i>

00:33:25,454 --> 00:33:27,389
your department
pursued

00:33:27,456 --> 00:33:29,992
the so-called "Miniature
Killer" for nearly a year

00:33:30,059 --> 00:33:32,761
before you identified
her as Natalie Davis.

00:33:32,828 --> 00:33:33,996
By the time she
was captured,

00:33:34,063 --> 00:33:37,333
she had kidnapped a
member of your team.

00:33:37,399 --> 00:33:40,569
You interviewed
her one time.

00:33:40,636 --> 00:33:42,605
Why only that once?

00:33:42,671 --> 00:33:44,607
During the course
of our interview,

00:33:44,673 --> 00:33:46,775
she had a psychotic break.

00:33:46,842 --> 00:33:47,810
Objection.

00:33:47,877 --> 00:33:48,944
Witness has no medical

00:33:49,011 --> 00:33:51,013
standing here
whatsoever.
Sustained.

00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,182
Will you please
rephrase?

00:33:53,249 --> 00:33:55,184
During the course
of our interview,

00:33:55,251 --> 00:33:58,854
Ms. Davis became non-responsive.

00:33:58,921 --> 00:34:01,557
So, one moment you were
having a conversation,

00:34:01,624 --> 00:34:02,925
and then the next... ?

00:34:02,992 --> 00:34:04,226
Tell me where Sara is!

00:34:04,293 --> 00:34:07,429
♪ I've got a pain
in my sawdust ♪

00:34:07,496 --> 00:34:10,766
♪ That's what's
the matter with me. ♪

00:34:10,833 --> 00:34:13,969
She started singing.

00:34:14,036 --> 00:34:16,038
NICHOLS:
To you?
GRISSOM:
No.

00:34:17,306 --> 00:34:20,242
I believe she was singing
to her dead sister.

00:34:20,309 --> 00:34:22,077
Objection.
Sustained.

00:34:22,144 --> 00:34:24,046
Her eyes

00:34:24,113 --> 00:34:26,115
were no longer focusing on me.

00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:30,453
She no longer seemed to hear
what I was saying.

00:34:30,519 --> 00:34:32,221
NICHOLS:
All right, Dr. Grissom,

00:34:32,288 --> 00:34:34,256
you've been here with us
in this room

00:34:34,323 --> 00:34:37,293
and you spoke to Natalie this
morning in the laundry.

00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:40,629
How does she appear
to you now?

00:34:40,696 --> 00:34:43,666
She makes eye contact.

00:34:43,732 --> 00:34:46,836
She answers questions
in a logical manner.

00:34:46,902 --> 00:34:48,904
She seems
very present.

00:34:50,539 --> 00:34:53,843
She even expresses remorse
for her past actions.

00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:56,378
In other words...

00:34:56,445 --> 00:34:58,414
normal.

00:34:58,481 --> 00:35:01,217
Thank you.

00:35:03,052 --> 00:35:04,887
(Bentley clears throat)

00:35:06,922 --> 00:35:09,892
I really only have one thing
to ask you, Dr. Grissom.

00:35:09,959 --> 00:35:12,928
What do you hope to get out
of coming here?

00:35:12,995 --> 00:35:15,764
I don't understand the question.

00:35:15,831 --> 00:35:16,966
Let me help.

00:35:17,032 --> 00:35:18,534
Are you trying to
punish Natalie

00:35:18,601 --> 00:35:20,202
for what she did
to Sara Sidle,

00:35:20,269 --> 00:35:21,437
your co-worker
and lover?

00:35:21,504 --> 00:35:22,605
NICHOLS:
Objection.

00:35:22,671 --> 00:35:24,173
I'll allow it.

00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,343
During our interview,
I did become frustrated.

00:35:27,409 --> 00:35:28,978
Oh, I know, I saw
the police video.

00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:30,546
You violently shook Ms. Davis

00:35:30,613 --> 00:35:32,815
when she wouldn't give you
Ms. Sidle's location.

00:35:32,882 --> 00:35:35,151
If you'd been alone
and unsupervised,

00:35:35,217 --> 00:35:36,786
you probably would've beaten it
out of her.

00:35:36,852 --> 00:35:38,454
NICHOLS:
Objection,
this is hypothetical.

00:35:38,521 --> 00:35:40,456
As I said, I was frustrated.

00:35:40,523 --> 00:35:43,292
I was also afraid
for my co-worker.

00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:46,061
Then you are here for revenge?

00:35:46,128 --> 00:35:48,063
(sighs)

00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:51,133
I don't care about revenge.

00:35:52,868 --> 00:35:55,805
I have no stake in the outcome
of these proceedings.

00:35:55,871 --> 00:35:57,807
Whether Natalie stays here
or goes to prison

00:35:57,873 --> 00:35:59,742
is at the discretion
of this court.

00:35:59,809 --> 00:36:02,745
I've been trying
to believe that people

00:36:02,812 --> 00:36:04,580
can change.

00:36:04,647 --> 00:36:06,682
Even people who are damaged.

00:36:09,418 --> 00:36:11,420
But I don't know if they can.

00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:17,760
I just don't know.

00:36:17,827 --> 00:36:20,763
JOHNSON:
<i>Brass went to Desert Palm</i>

00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:22,765
to look for Peter,
but he was already gone.

00:36:22,832 --> 00:36:24,767
So, head of surveillance
sent me over

00:36:24,834 --> 00:36:27,036
this security video for you.

00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:28,704
Did someone tip him off?

00:36:28,771 --> 00:36:32,007
Well, that's what I
would have thought
until I saw this.

00:36:32,074 --> 00:36:34,376
Peter went down
to smoke a cigarette

00:36:34,443 --> 00:36:35,911
every couple of hours.

00:36:35,978 --> 00:36:37,246
That's Kelsey.

00:36:37,313 --> 00:36:39,582
Look how she's standing
behind him,

00:36:39,648 --> 00:36:41,083
with her hands
in her pockets.

00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:42,751
Does she have
a gun?

00:36:42,818 --> 00:36:44,587
That looks
pretty intense.

00:36:44,653 --> 00:36:47,056
Where'd they go?

00:36:48,824 --> 00:36:50,493
Let's see what she drives.

00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:52,995
(typing)

00:36:56,565 --> 00:36:58,501
Look at that.

00:36:58,567 --> 00:37:00,336
Kelsey's car is equipped

00:37:00,402 --> 00:37:02,171
with an Auto-Shadow
G.P.S. system.

00:37:02,238 --> 00:37:04,707
We'll need an Attorney General
Waiver to activate it.

00:37:04,773 --> 00:37:06,775
(sirens wailing)

00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:19,255
(panting)

00:37:19,321 --> 00:37:20,589
Please...

00:37:20,656 --> 00:37:23,125
Dig!
(sirens approaching)

00:37:41,177 --> 00:37:44,313
Let's put the gun down, Kelsey.

00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:46,615
Tell them what you did.

00:37:46,682 --> 00:37:47,950
Tell them!

00:37:50,686 --> 00:37:53,389
(panting):
I killed...

00:37:53,456 --> 00:37:56,459
I killed Trevor Murphy,
and I buried him.

00:38:00,529 --> 00:38:04,867
If you do this, Kelsey,
I can't help you.

00:38:07,837 --> 00:38:09,939
Give me the gun.

00:38:10,005 --> 00:38:12,441
When Nathan told me
he found him, I...

00:38:12,508 --> 00:38:14,443
I couldn't get it out
of my head.

00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:17,179
I staked out his house
for a few weeks.

00:38:17,246 --> 00:38:18,781
Just like dad would've.
Learned his schedule.

00:38:18,848 --> 00:38:22,451
They weren't supposed
to be there!

00:38:23,853 --> 00:38:25,855
(cocking gun)

00:38:29,258 --> 00:38:30,092
(camera snapping)
(gasps)

00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:32,194
Mom!
Get away from my daughter!

00:38:32,261 --> 00:38:33,596
(pistol whipping)

00:38:34,363 --> 00:38:35,598
(bangs head on table)

00:38:35,664 --> 00:38:36,699
(gunshot)

00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:40,169
Everything got so messed up.

00:38:40,236 --> 00:38:42,004
We know you didn't mean
to hurt Janelle and Nora.

00:38:42,071 --> 00:38:43,105
We know that.

00:38:43,172 --> 00:38:44,240
Dig!

00:38:46,208 --> 00:38:48,511
Now I talked to the hospital.

00:38:48,577 --> 00:38:49,979
The little girl's
going to make it.

00:38:50,045 --> 00:38:51,814
Really?

00:38:51,881 --> 00:38:53,149
Good.

00:38:53,215 --> 00:38:54,316
That's good.

00:38:54,383 --> 00:38:56,719
Now all you
have to do...

00:38:56,786 --> 00:38:58,354
is give me the gun.

00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:01,557
We can still fix it.

00:39:01,624 --> 00:39:02,691
Listen to them.

00:39:02,758 --> 00:39:04,894
Please.
Shut up!

00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,895
I confessed, all right?
Arrest me.

00:39:05,961 --> 00:39:07,029
Just... I'll spend the rest

00:39:07,096 --> 00:39:08,130
of my life in jail.

00:39:08,197 --> 00:39:09,365
Shut up!
Just...

00:39:09,431 --> 00:39:11,667
Come on, everybody,
just take it easy. Relax.

00:39:11,734 --> 00:39:12,902
We don't have
to do anything.

00:39:12,968 --> 00:39:14,136
So don't do anything.

00:39:14,203 --> 00:39:16,172
Just calm down.
Daddy...

00:39:16,238 --> 00:39:18,174
BRASS:
That's good.

00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,075
Okay.

00:39:20,142 --> 00:39:21,877
There you go.
That's okay.

00:39:21,944 --> 00:39:23,045
Come on.

00:39:23,112 --> 00:39:24,180
Give me the gun.

00:39:24,246 --> 00:39:25,681
Come on.

00:39:25,748 --> 00:39:28,918
I really tried to forget.

00:39:28,984 --> 00:39:30,319
(four gunshots)

00:39:30,886 --> 00:39:32,021
(two gunshots)

00:39:35,791 --> 00:39:36,759
(gasping)

00:39:36,826 --> 00:39:37,893
Kelsey.

00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,528
Come on.

00:39:54,743 --> 00:39:56,679
BENTLEY:
Judge Brenner has ordered her

00:39:56,745 --> 00:39:58,681
to be transferred
to the State Prison in Jean.

00:39:58,747 --> 00:40:01,183
She'll continue
to receive her meds,

00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:03,519
but as far as therapy goes,
they can't do much.

00:40:03,586 --> 00:40:06,355
I'm sorry I couldn't
have been more help.

00:40:06,422 --> 00:40:08,424
I'll take her
from here.

00:40:12,328 --> 00:40:13,996
You're wrong about me.

00:40:16,098 --> 00:40:18,968
I really have changed.

00:40:23,172 --> 00:40:25,708
I have changed.

00:40:25,774 --> 00:40:30,846
And I really do believe
that people who do bad things...

00:40:30,913 --> 00:40:33,249
need to be punished.

00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:43,092
(door closes)
