Look,

00:00:50,178 --> 00:00:53,282
this might win second prize
at the talent contest

00:00:53,348 --> 00:00:57,219
at Spiro Agnew High School
in Bad Limp, Arkansas...

00:00:57,286 --> 00:00:58,587
Hey, Drew.

00:00:59,454 --> 00:01:00,689
It's not my kid's fault.

00:01:00,756 --> 00:01:02,658
Who let Daddy Dearest
on the stage?

00:01:02,724 --> 00:01:04,660
I gave specific orders...

00:01:04,726 --> 00:01:05,961
Everybody's
moving around

00:01:06,028 --> 00:01:07,563
like there's nothing
important going on.

00:01:07,629 --> 00:01:08,830
How about
a little respect, okay?

00:01:08,897 --> 00:01:11,867
Except for your kid
doesn't deserve respect.

00:01:11,934 --> 00:01:13,702
Lazy little prima donna.

00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:16,972
Maybe you should sit
with the losers.

00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:18,240
SINGER:
Let me try it again.

00:01:18,307 --> 00:01:19,808
You don't care.

00:01:19,875 --> 00:01:21,710
I do <i>so</i> care--
this isn't a game

00:01:21,777 --> 00:01:23,312
to me, all right?
I'm a good singer.

00:01:23,378 --> 00:01:25,847
It's all I've ever wanted to do,
and you have no right...

00:01:25,914 --> 00:01:27,349
There! <i>That</i> passion.

00:01:27,416 --> 00:01:29,985
That's what I want to see
when you sing.

00:01:30,052 --> 00:01:31,086
Now, let's
do it again.

00:01:31,153 --> 00:01:32,387
And watch your pitch, baby.

00:01:32,454 --> 00:01:34,723
Too early in the day
to be that flat.

00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,825
I know I wasn't flat.

00:01:36,892 --> 00:01:38,327

You tell us
to feel everything,

00:02:06,021 --> 00:02:09,024
but you don't feel anything.

00:02:09,091 --> 00:02:11,793

that the ratings
will be through the roof


00:04:39,374 --> 00:04:41,443
on our final show.


00:04:41,509 --> 00:04:43,144

00:04:43,211 --> 00:04:45,246

Excuse me?

00:04:53,688 --> 00:04:54,823
Who are you?


00:04:54,889 --> 00:04:56,758
I'm Detective Jim
Brass, Las Vegas Police.


00:04:56,825 --> 00:04:58,326
We're trying
to confirm the whereabouts


00:04:58,393 --> 00:04:59,928
of Layla Wells last night.


00:04:59,994 --> 00:05:01,096
Can you help us?


00:05:01,162 --> 00:05:02,731
She left rehearsal
last night around 7:00.


00:05:02,797 --> 00:05:06,234
Went back to her room,
as far as I know.


00:05:06,301 --> 00:05:07,702
Chaperone says she
called at midnight,


00:05:07,769 --> 00:05:09,170
said she was going to bed.


00:05:09,237 --> 00:05:10,638
Where's the chaperone?


00:05:10,705 --> 00:05:11,806
Fired her this morning.


00:05:11,873 --> 00:05:13,641
Obviously, she wasn't
doing her job.


00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:16,077
Okay.
Layla's an
emancipated minor,


00:05:16,144 --> 00:05:18,213
but her chaperone's supposed
to be looking out for her,


00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:20,348
not pumping per diem into
a slot machine all night.


00:05:20,415 --> 00:05:21,683
This means
you won, Kip.


00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,184
You're the champion.


00:05:23,251 --> 00:05:24,586
No, he's not.


00:05:24,652 --> 00:05:25,653
Ajaya!


00:05:26,921 --> 00:05:28,623
Last one voted off.


00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,592
You're back on
against Kip.


00:05:30,658 --> 00:05:32,093
BRASS:
We're gonna need
contact information


00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,495
from Miss Wells's family.


00:05:33,561 --> 00:05:34,996
Michelle can get it to you.


00:05:35,063 --> 00:05:36,698
Now, I have a show to produce.


00:05:36,765 --> 00:05:38,066
Call editing.


00:05:38,133 --> 00:05:41,002
I want a DVD of every frame
we have on Layla


00:05:41,069 --> 00:05:43,505
on my desk, one hour.
Okay.


00:05:43,571 --> 00:05:45,907
If this was a killer
that fetishized her,


00:05:45,974 --> 00:05:47,709
why not just
dump the body?


00:05:47,776 --> 00:05:50,111
Why bother to wrap her up?
To conceal the body


00:05:50,178 --> 00:05:51,980
during transport
from the primary.


00:05:52,046 --> 00:05:55,550
It's consistent with those knots
being tied into a handle.


00:05:55,617 --> 00:05:58,620
You know, the looping here
looks like a reef knot.


00:05:58,686 --> 00:06:01,756
Might be looking for somebody
with some sailing experience.


00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:04,959
(quiet whirring)


00:06:05,026 --> 00:06:07,462
"Rancho Linen Service."


00:06:07,529 --> 00:06:09,631
They deliver
to every hotel on the Strip.


00:06:09,697 --> 00:06:12,067
Been around since
Bugsy Siegel's days.


00:06:12,133 --> 00:06:15,203
Which is probably the last time
this tablecloth was washed.


00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,472
These discolorations
suggest that


00:06:17,539 --> 00:06:20,308
this has been
on somebody's table a long time.


00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:22,510
ADAMS:
What was Layla doing <i>here?</i>


00:06:22,577 --> 00:06:25,213
She had a great room
at the Palermo,


00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,649
people waiting on her
day and night.


00:06:27,715 --> 00:06:30,185
You ever been in
one of those suites?


00:06:30,251 --> 00:06:31,886
Just to get evidence.


00:06:33,254 --> 00:06:35,190
I sure wouldn't
leave there for...


00:06:35,256 --> 00:06:37,525
whatever this is.


00:06:41,896 --> 00:06:44,265
Couple of blood drops.


00:06:44,332 --> 00:06:47,001
There's no trail.


00:06:47,068 --> 00:06:49,871
Probably dripped
through the cloth.


00:06:53,441 --> 00:06:56,277
These wheel tracks
are 11 inches apart.


00:06:59,414 --> 00:07:01,282
It couldn't have been
a grocery cart.


00:07:01,349 --> 00:07:03,284
The front wheels are
narrower than the back,


00:07:03,351 --> 00:07:05,520
so it would've left two
different sets of tracks.


00:07:05,587 --> 00:07:10,792
Something tells me a guy pushing
any kind of cart in this area


00:07:10,859 --> 00:07:12,427
wouldn't be that unusual.


00:07:13,461 --> 00:07:14,963
(shutter clicks)


00:07:16,798 --> 00:07:19,701
ROBBINS:
That blunt-force trauma
just below the rib cage


00:07:19,768 --> 00:07:21,403
is your C.O.D.


00:07:21,469 --> 00:07:22,871
Lacerated the liver.


00:07:22,937 --> 00:07:25,440
Hangs lower when
the body's upright.


00:07:25,507 --> 00:07:27,709
Since no ribs
were impacted,


00:07:27,776 --> 00:07:30,245
she was standing when
the blow occurred.


00:07:30,311 --> 00:07:31,980
(gasps)


00:07:33,782 --> 00:07:36,551
Death would have occurred
fairly quickly.


00:07:36,618 --> 00:07:40,789
Any indication
of sexual assault?


00:07:40,855 --> 00:07:43,191
No. However, when I was doing
the internal exam,


00:07:43,258 --> 00:07:45,927
I found an embryo implanted
in the uterine wall,


00:07:45,994 --> 00:07:48,263
maybe 20
millimeters long.


00:07:48,329 --> 00:07:50,098
She was pregnant.


00:07:50,165 --> 00:07:51,499
About eight weeks.


00:07:51,566 --> 00:07:53,668
I sent cord tissue to DNA.


00:07:53,735 --> 00:07:57,539
So maybe this isn't just
a case of negligent chaperone.


00:07:57,605 --> 00:07:59,874
Maybe it's motive.


00:08:12,887 --> 00:08:15,490
Got a reading?
Yeah.


00:08:15,557 --> 00:08:17,592
BRASS:
So, the Lock
Interrogator says


00:08:17,659 --> 00:08:19,294
that Layla last used
her key card


00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,930
to enter her room
at 7:12 p.m.


00:08:21,996 --> 00:08:24,833
That's right after
she walked out of rehearsal.
Hm.


00:08:24,899 --> 00:08:27,469
Now, according
to the hotel phone records,


00:08:27,535 --> 00:08:30,205
she made two calls--
one to Drew Rich's room


00:08:30,271 --> 00:08:33,007
around 7:34 p.m.
Probably to apologize.


00:08:33,074 --> 00:08:34,309
And the other one
to her chaperone


00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:35,443
to say good night
around midnight.


00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:36,778
Went to
voice mail.


00:08:36,845 --> 00:08:39,314
Casino surveillance
says that the chaperone


00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:43,551
stayed up all night trying
to win a progressive.


00:08:44,719 --> 00:08:46,621
From about 8:00 on,

00:08:46,688 --> 00:08:49,124
she was looking up
abortion clinics.

00:08:50,391 --> 00:08:52,327
It looks like
she had a change of heart;

00:08:52,393 --> 00:08:55,029
started checking out
adoption agencies.

00:08:55,096 --> 00:08:58,433
Huh.
Sounds like a confused kid.

00:09:03,138 --> 00:09:05,607
Well, it looks like they're a
cute couple, I'll give you that,

00:09:05,673 --> 00:09:07,509
but what I don't get
is why anybody wants

00:09:07,575 --> 00:09:09,010
to watch that
show-- I don't.

00:09:09,077 --> 00:09:10,111
It's a talent contest?

00:09:10,178 --> 00:09:12,013
It's more like a
humiliation ritual.

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,715
Well, you'd know
about that.

00:09:13,782 --> 00:09:15,483
(chuckles):
All right.

00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:17,952
So, you want to know
why that kid Ajaya

00:09:18,019 --> 00:09:20,155
with the fluffy hair,
sings like a hinge,

00:09:20,221 --> 00:09:22,791
why he got into
the semifinals?
Hm?

00:09:22,857 --> 00:09:25,393
Me and 10,000 other guys
vote for him every week

00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,962
on the Internet.

00:09:28,029 --> 00:09:31,232
But if you don't watch,
how do you know about him?

00:09:31,299 --> 00:09:34,202
Oh, you know, water
cooler talk, gossip.

00:09:34,269 --> 00:09:36,171
Mm. Right.

00:09:36,237 --> 00:09:37,672
(clears throat):
Well...

00:09:37,739 --> 00:09:39,441
here's something
the gossips don't have.

00:09:41,109 --> 00:09:44,345
Okay, there's
the humiliator.

00:09:44,412 --> 00:09:46,081
Layla left
the Palermo, too,


00:09:46,147 --> 00:09:48,650
just after midnight.


00:09:48,716 --> 00:09:51,719
Two minutes later...


00:09:51,786 --> 00:09:54,389
Kip follows.


00:09:54,456 --> 00:09:56,724
BRASS:
<i>It must've been pretty hard</i>


00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:59,594
for you and Layla
to find some time together.


00:09:59,661 --> 00:10:01,796
You know, can't get
your mojo workin'

00:10:01,863 --> 00:10:04,666
when Daddy's lurkin'.

00:10:04,733 --> 00:10:06,234
So what did you do?

00:10:06,301 --> 00:10:07,902
You waited till midnight,
Dad's asleep,

00:10:07,969 --> 00:10:10,371
and you take separate
elevators down.

00:10:10,438 --> 00:10:12,574
Then what?

00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,908
Layla was found
in a pretty tough neighborhood.

00:10:13,975 --> 00:10:15,043
What were you
doing over there,

00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:17,312
scoring drugs?
He doesn't do drugs.

00:10:17,378 --> 00:10:18,913
Or maybe it was to get
a back-alley abortion.

00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,148
What?

00:10:20,215 --> 00:10:22,851
Layla was eight weeks pregnant--
am I right?

00:10:22,917 --> 00:10:24,786
And who's the daddy?

00:10:24,853 --> 00:10:25,987
You?

00:10:26,054 --> 00:10:27,689
The hell it was.

00:10:27,756 --> 00:10:29,357
I'm not
talking to you.

00:10:29,424 --> 00:10:31,960
Kip...
Just shut up.
Just... shut up.

00:10:32,026 --> 00:10:33,228
We're going to
need a DNA sample.

00:10:33,294 --> 00:10:34,529
No way.
You're done abusing my kid.

00:10:34,596 --> 00:10:35,597
And so are you.

00:10:35,663 --> 00:10:37,665
Sit down. Take him
out in the hall.

00:10:37,732 --> 00:10:38,800
You can't do this.

00:10:38,867 --> 00:10:41,069
Dad...
Hey, check
it out.

00:10:41,136 --> 00:10:42,937
I've got you and Kip
returning to the hotel

00:10:43,004 --> 00:10:44,172
after the time
of the murder.

00:10:44,239 --> 00:10:46,574
You're like a
team, right?

00:10:46,641 --> 00:10:47,575
You're in it
together,

00:10:47,642 --> 00:10:48,910
50-50.

00:10:48,977 --> 00:10:50,645
You know, the contest,
the career,

00:10:50,712 --> 00:10:52,147
and future
earnings.

00:10:52,213 --> 00:10:53,181
It's a lot of money.

00:10:53,248 --> 00:10:54,582
And that's what this
is about, right?

00:10:54,649 --> 00:10:55,817
The money?
30 million people

00:10:55,884 --> 00:10:59,888
tune in to hear
my kid sing every week.

00:10:59,954 --> 00:11:01,456
How many people want
to watch you?

00:11:01,523 --> 00:11:04,559
So you're on the
road four months?

00:11:04,626 --> 00:11:06,194
How'd you work that out
with your job?

00:11:06,261 --> 00:11:07,896
I took a leave of absence.

00:11:10,265 --> 00:11:13,201
Come on, sailor,
you abandoned ship.

00:11:13,268 --> 00:11:16,371
You quit your job, got a
second mortgage on your house.

00:11:16,438 --> 00:11:19,174
If Kip screws up,
you're wiped out,

00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,876
so I can understand how
you'd cover up for him,

00:11:21,943 --> 00:11:23,678
and maybe you're
even desperate enough

00:11:23,745 --> 00:11:26,381
to kill her yourself.

00:11:31,086 --> 00:11:33,354
SIMMS:
<i>So I ran that fetal cord tissue</i>
<i>that Doc Robbins sent over.</i>

00:11:33,421 --> 00:11:36,091
I subtracted out the
mother's profile,

00:11:36,157 --> 00:11:38,126
leaving what has to be
the father's contribution,

00:11:38,193 --> 00:11:41,796
and it didn't match the
sample from Kip Westerman.

00:11:41,863 --> 00:11:43,631
So he's not the father
of Layla's baby.

00:11:43,698 --> 00:11:47,635
No, but then I ran those
alleles through CODIS and...

00:11:47,702 --> 00:11:49,804
I got a hit.

00:11:49,871 --> 00:11:51,272
Marvin Fleck.

00:11:51,339 --> 00:11:54,776
In the system from charges
in North Carolina in 2002.

00:11:54,843 --> 00:11:56,010
Mm-hmm.

00:11:56,077 --> 00:11:57,812
Do you recognize Marvin?

00:11:57,879 --> 00:11:59,714
Drew Rich?

00:11:59,781 --> 00:12:01,182
Yeah, he had sex
with a minor--

00:12:01,249 --> 00:12:02,984
she was 15
years old--

00:12:03,051 --> 00:12:04,219
but then she
changed her story,

00:12:04,285 --> 00:12:06,020
so the charges
were dropped.

00:12:06,087 --> 00:12:08,389
Want to bet
he paid her off?

00:12:08,456 --> 00:12:11,392
DREW RICH:
Talent and ambition ran
in Layla Wells's family.

00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:14,229
Her grandmother Jasmine
was a Las Vegas showgirl

00:12:14,295 --> 00:12:16,765
who gave Layla her first
figure-skating classes.

00:12:16,831 --> 00:12:20,001
Sadly, Layla's grandmother
didn't live

00:12:20,068 --> 00:12:21,970
to see her come
so close to becoming

00:12:22,036 --> 00:12:23,438
America's next
<i>Overnight Sensation.</i>

00:12:23,505 --> 00:12:25,039
LAYLA:
My mama didn't approve
of show business.

00:12:25,106 --> 00:12:26,241
We were always fighting

00:12:26,307 --> 00:12:29,844
about it, so I went
to live with my grandma.

00:12:29,911 --> 00:12:31,112
Trim the ice ballet,

00:12:31,179 --> 00:12:32,814
give me some more shots
where she's crying.

00:12:32,881 --> 00:12:34,949
We need to see some
more emotion, man.

00:12:35,016 --> 00:12:36,618
BRASS:
Mr. Rich.

00:12:36,684 --> 00:12:39,554
Later.
Marvin.

00:12:43,258 --> 00:12:46,327
I left rehearsal
around 7:15.

00:12:46,394 --> 00:12:50,198
I went back
to my room alone.

00:12:50,265 --> 00:12:51,800
I needed some time
to think.

00:12:51,866 --> 00:12:54,869
Is thinking what
got Layla pregnant?

00:12:54,936 --> 00:12:56,971
These kids might seem
like innocents,

00:12:57,038 --> 00:12:58,673
but they're not.

00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,675
They are first-class
manipulators

00:13:00,742 --> 00:13:02,811
with the survival instincts
of a coyote.

00:13:02,877 --> 00:13:04,679
I told Layla I'd pay
for an abortion,

00:13:04,746 --> 00:13:07,649
and she agreed,

00:13:07,715 --> 00:13:10,452
as long as she won
the competition.

00:13:10,518 --> 00:13:11,853
I don't like
being blackmailed.

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,388
Sounds like motive.
Doesn't mean

00:13:13,455 --> 00:13:14,889
I killed her.
We know you
left the Palermo

00:13:14,956 --> 00:13:16,958
around midnight.

00:13:17,025 --> 00:13:18,827
About 20 minutes later,
your credit card was used

00:13:18,893 --> 00:13:20,095
at the Blue
Madonna Motel.

00:13:20,161 --> 00:13:21,196
I wasn't with Layla.

00:13:21,262 --> 00:13:23,665
Her body was found
three blocks from there.

00:13:23,732 --> 00:13:25,300
You beat rape charges once.

00:13:25,366 --> 00:13:27,769
Maybe you thought you wouldn't
be so lucky a second time.

00:13:27,836 --> 00:13:30,305
This is ridiculous.
Look... I was with a hooker.

00:13:30,371 --> 00:13:31,473
All right?

00:13:31,539 --> 00:13:33,341
Layla was pregnant
with your child.

00:13:33,408 --> 00:13:34,542
That's statutory rape.

00:13:34,609 --> 00:13:35,810
Age of consent
in Nevada is 16.

00:13:35,877 --> 00:13:38,480
No, have your lawyer look
at the statute again.

00:13:38,546 --> 00:13:40,315
There's an exception
when a person

00:13:40,381 --> 00:13:43,485
is in a position of
authority with a teenager--

00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,553
like "executive producer."

00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:46,855
Come on, let's go.

00:13:49,424 --> 00:13:50,759
Spermaceti.

00:13:50,825 --> 00:13:52,961
An oil found in the heads
of sperm whales.

00:13:53,027 --> 00:13:55,163
Mm-hmm, and when it
cools, it becomes a wax.

00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:57,132
The lipstick that the
dead girl was wearing

00:13:57,198 --> 00:13:58,800
had a spermaceti
wax base.

00:13:58,867 --> 00:14:01,202
There's been a ban
on sperm whaling for 20 years.

00:14:01,269 --> 00:14:03,738
Yeah, which means that
the lipstick is very old.

00:14:03,805 --> 00:14:05,874
You know, spermaceti is
not the weirdest thing

00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,108
found in lipstick.

00:14:07,175 --> 00:14:08,977
The ancient Greeks made
theirs out of saliva,

00:14:09,043 --> 00:14:10,845
sheep sweat, and
crocodile excrement.

00:14:10,912 --> 00:14:15,083
Did any of the makeup in her
hotel room contain spermaceti?

00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:17,652
No, but there were intriguingly
analogous results from,

00:14:17,719 --> 00:14:21,856
believe it or not...
the tablecloth.

00:14:21,923 --> 00:14:24,759
Take a look.

00:14:27,962 --> 00:14:29,931
Asbestos?

00:14:29,998 --> 00:14:32,333
Specific type of asbestos
called amocite.

00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,069
Its particles are
bound together by

00:14:34,135 --> 00:14:35,904
<i>vermiculite and cellulose,</i>

00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:38,039
<i>a combination found</i>
<i>in spray-on ceilings.</i>

00:14:38,106 --> 00:14:39,207
That type of ceiling material

00:14:39,274 --> 00:14:41,109
hasn't been used
in 20 or 30 years.

00:14:41,176 --> 00:14:42,610
You know, it's as if

00:14:42,677 --> 00:14:45,580
your victim found a hole
in the time-space continuum

00:14:45,647 --> 00:14:47,715
and was murdered decades ago.

00:14:47,782 --> 00:14:50,752
Brilliant theory, Dave.

00:14:50,819 --> 00:14:52,353
Thanks.

00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,456
Thank you.

00:14:54,522 --> 00:14:58,093
STOKES: So this was
the Strip 50 years ago.

00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:00,295
The Vegas my dad came to.

00:15:00,361 --> 00:15:01,996
Now, any one of
the big hotels

00:15:02,063 --> 00:15:03,832
has more rooms than
all these put together.

00:15:03,898 --> 00:15:07,535
Nearly all the old casinos
that Rancho Linen serviced

00:15:07,602 --> 00:15:09,504
have been torn down.

00:15:09,571 --> 00:15:12,273
Except for this one,
on the west side.

00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:15,677
Where Layla's body was found.

00:15:19,347 --> 00:15:21,349
<i>Le ChÃ¢teau Rouge.</i>

00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:31,359
Man, last time I was
this deep in the hood,

00:15:31,426 --> 00:15:33,628
I was on a case with Warrick.

00:15:33,695 --> 00:15:34,896
(car alarm sounding in distance)

00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,202
Got some track marks here.

00:15:47,542 --> 00:15:49,177
11 inches apart.

00:15:49,244 --> 00:15:51,146
Same as the other
ones I found.

00:16:00,021 --> 00:16:02,824
Layla was wearing a pink sweater
when she left the Palermo.

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,362
(grunting, fabric ripping)

00:16:08,897 --> 00:16:11,066
We have a crime scene.

00:16:11,132 --> 00:16:12,600
No warrant needed.

00:16:14,636 --> 00:16:18,640
If Layla did get inside,
somebody locked up after her.

00:16:28,783 --> 00:16:31,052
STOKES:
Wow.

00:16:31,119 --> 00:16:32,487
It's like someone
yelled "fire"

00:16:32,554 --> 00:16:34,456
50 years ago,
and nobody came back.

00:16:34,522 --> 00:16:35,490
Yeah.

00:16:35,557 --> 00:16:38,159
You can still feel it
in the air.

00:16:38,226 --> 00:16:40,495
Legends walked here.

00:16:40,562 --> 00:16:42,063
Louis Armstrong,
Nat "King" Cole,

00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:44,566
Dinah Washington.

00:16:44,632 --> 00:16:47,402
First integrated casino
in town.

00:16:47,469 --> 00:16:51,206
Place was smoking
so hot every night,

00:16:51,272 --> 00:16:54,442
they added a 2:30 a.m. show.

00:16:54,509 --> 00:16:57,212
Sinatra, the Rat Pack--

00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:00,148
all the white headliners
and tourists

00:17:00,215 --> 00:17:01,850
came down from the Strip.

00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:04,686
Place was swinging till dawn.

00:17:04,753 --> 00:17:07,655
Then, six months
after it opened,

00:17:07,722 --> 00:17:09,724
the joint closed
overnight.

00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:11,726
How come?

00:17:11,793 --> 00:17:14,028
Rumor has it
the Kansas City Mob

00:17:14,095 --> 00:17:16,898
didn't like the East Coast boys
poaching their pigeons.

00:17:16,965 --> 00:17:19,968
Back then, there were only eight
or nine casinos on the Strip.

00:17:20,034 --> 00:17:21,302
700 or 800 people were here

00:17:21,369 --> 00:17:24,072
instead of there, well,

00:17:24,139 --> 00:17:26,107
do the math.

00:17:26,174 --> 00:17:28,810
This cart can match
the tracks I found.

00:17:32,947 --> 00:17:34,516
Rancho Linen Service.

00:17:40,855 --> 00:17:42,924
Hey, give me some light
over here, will you?

00:17:46,461 --> 00:17:48,263
That's the only table
without a tablecloth.

00:18:00,341 --> 00:18:02,110
We've got blood.

00:18:05,647 --> 00:18:07,649
Better call P.D.,

00:18:07,715 --> 00:18:09,117
track down the owner
of the building.

00:18:09,184 --> 00:18:11,986
It's time to reopen
Le ChÃ¢teau Rouge.

00:18:25,478 --> 00:18:26,813
Whose car is that, man?

00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,814
Building owner.

00:18:27,881 --> 00:18:30,650
ChÃ¢teau Rouge, man.

00:18:30,717 --> 00:18:32,218
My parents came here.

00:18:32,285 --> 00:18:34,287
They still
talk about it.

00:18:42,128 --> 00:18:43,963
Good evening.

00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,165
My name's
Gil Grissom.

00:18:45,231 --> 00:18:46,900
I'm with the Crime Lab.

00:18:46,966 --> 00:18:50,236
Well, I hope your people are
taking care with my property.

00:18:50,303 --> 00:18:52,939
I understand it has
quite a history.

00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:54,841
You're too young to remember.

00:18:54,908 --> 00:18:56,276
I've heard stories.

00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:57,610
Wasn't there a night

00:18:57,677 --> 00:19:00,213
when Sammy Davis sang,
and the only way

00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,548
they'd let him off the stage

00:19:01,614 --> 00:19:03,583
was if he took the whole crowd
to breakfast?

00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:05,652
More than once.

00:19:05,719 --> 00:19:06,653
Come on in.

00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,887
Have a drink.

00:19:07,954 --> 00:19:09,856
Thank you, but I'm working.

00:19:09,923 --> 00:19:12,292
Well, then you can
watch me drink.

00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:22,369
In Rome, they illuminate
the ruins every night.

00:19:22,435 --> 00:19:26,640
The Italians see beauty
in what... what used to be.

00:19:26,706 --> 00:19:30,744
It's been 50 years since
I've seen lights on the Rouge.

00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,482
She walks in beauty,
like the night.

00:19:38,418 --> 00:19:41,154
My husband, Jules Rosenthal,
built this.

00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:43,189
Do you know it was
the first casino

00:19:43,256 --> 00:19:45,492
where blacks weren't
turned away at the door?

00:19:45,558 --> 00:19:47,494
Your husband was
a brave man.

00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,329
Oh, he liked making money.

00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:51,131
He gave it the best

00:19:51,197 --> 00:19:52,932
of everything.

00:19:52,999 --> 00:19:55,001
The decor, the food, the music.

00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:59,172
It was exciting.

00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,907
Magical, really.

00:20:00,974 --> 00:20:03,376
As long as it lasted.

00:20:03,443 --> 00:20:05,178
But it died with him.

00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:08,748
I haven't been inside since...

00:20:08,815 --> 00:20:11,518
since he was murdered there.

00:20:11,584 --> 00:20:14,821
Why didn't you
sell the property?

00:20:14,888 --> 00:20:18,124
There's no such thing
as sentiment in Las Vegas.

00:20:18,191 --> 00:20:21,261
They would have torn it down,
and I... I couldn't,

00:20:21,328 --> 00:20:22,996
I couldn't bear that.

00:20:23,063 --> 00:20:24,798
Would you like to go in now?

00:20:24,864 --> 00:20:27,400
Mm-mm.

00:20:27,467 --> 00:20:30,036
You can only wake up once
from a dream.

00:20:56,896 --> 00:20:59,733
SANDERS:
Wow, you know

00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:01,267
I have a glitter fetish,
don't you?

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,277
Lots of recent
activity over here.

00:21:19,386 --> 00:21:20,854
"Jasmine."

00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:24,557
Wasn't Layla's grandmother's
name Jasmine?

00:21:24,624 --> 00:21:26,292
I think so, yeah.

00:21:29,696 --> 00:21:32,232
I think that Layla

00:21:32,298 --> 00:21:34,934
was trying to connect
with her roots.

00:21:56,556 --> 00:21:59,592
I think I got a bullet
in the floor.

00:21:59,659 --> 00:22:02,362
Impact blew the dust back,

00:22:02,429 --> 00:22:03,897
so it must be recent.

00:22:03,963 --> 00:22:07,033
Got something else
that wasn't here 50 years ago.

00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,702
Cell phone.

00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:12,305
It's Layla's.

00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:14,174
That explains why
we didn't find one on her

00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,875
or in her room.

00:22:15,942 --> 00:22:19,279

was "video camera."

00:24:09,389 --> 00:24:11,224
we just gave to each other.

She, uh, (sniffles)

00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:15,762
I looked out for her.

00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:17,197
I cared about her.

00:24:17,263 --> 00:24:21,401
I, I tried to make her
feel... safe.

00:24:24,204 --> 00:24:26,473
Nobody else loved her.

00:24:26,539 --> 00:24:28,842
Not like me.

00:24:28,908 --> 00:24:30,910
Nobody.

00:24:30,977 --> 00:24:33,380
I, uh...

00:24:33,446 --> 00:24:35,482
I found out online about
where her grandma danced.

00:24:35,548 --> 00:24:38,685
I thought it'd be a cool
surprise to take her.

00:24:38,752 --> 00:24:40,320
Didn't you read
that part where it says,

00:24:40,387 --> 00:24:42,188
"Don't go in after dark"?

00:24:42,255 --> 00:24:43,657
I just wanted to get
a picture of her

00:24:43,723 --> 00:24:45,925
in front of the place and get
back in the cab, but she...

00:24:45,992 --> 00:24:48,795
(deep breath):
she was, like,
insane to get in there.

00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:50,196
She pulled apart a fence.

00:24:50,263 --> 00:24:52,298
She found some door
that wasn't locked.

00:25:47,854 --> 00:25:49,456
she wasn't anywhere.

00:25:51,491 --> 00:25:53,226

at the Dunes,

00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:19,999
I used to make that my last stop
on the way home.

00:30:20,066 --> 00:30:22,101
Lived on
the west side, then, huh?

00:30:22,168 --> 00:30:23,469
Yeah, Sheriff,
you know.

00:30:23,536 --> 00:30:24,771
We had to.

00:30:24,837 --> 00:30:27,340
Vegas was known as
"Mississippi of the West."

00:30:27,407 --> 00:30:28,975
Pearl Bailey,
Nat King Cole,

00:30:29,042 --> 00:30:32,345
Sammy Davis, Lena Horne,
the Mills Brothers--

00:30:32,412 --> 00:30:34,313
I booked them all into
the big rooms on the Strip.

00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,549
But they could not stay
in the hotels.

00:30:36,616 --> 00:30:38,918
They couldn't even gamble
in the casinos.

00:30:38,985 --> 00:30:40,153
As a matter of fact,

00:30:40,219 --> 00:30:42,355
they came in and out
through the kitchen.

00:30:42,422 --> 00:30:44,557
You remember
beautiful Dorothy Dandridge?

00:30:44,624 --> 00:30:47,326
There was something about her
going in for a swim

00:30:47,393 --> 00:30:49,162
at one of the hotels.

00:30:49,228 --> 00:30:51,698
They drained
the whole damn pool.

00:30:51,764 --> 00:30:53,566
Sheriff,
it's up to you.

00:30:53,633 --> 00:30:55,635
Twenty.

00:30:57,103 --> 00:30:58,604
I'm gone.

00:30:58,671 --> 00:31:00,006
Grissom?

00:31:00,073 --> 00:31:03,876
BRIDGES:
The women at the ChÃ¢teau Rouge--
mm-mm-mm!

00:31:03,943 --> 00:31:07,080
They had such
tiny waists.

00:31:07,146 --> 00:31:09,282
And cakes, too.

00:31:09,349 --> 00:31:12,485
Ponytails was
the big thing then.

00:31:12,552 --> 00:31:14,954
They all had cute
little ponytails.

00:31:15,021 --> 00:31:17,457
Lord have mercy.

00:31:19,025 --> 00:31:20,893

No $20?

00:31:25,531 --> 00:31:27,266
Raise to $50.

00:31:27,333 --> 00:31:30,036
SCHLATTER:
Matter of fact, when they
whacked Jules Rosenthal,

00:31:30,103 --> 00:31:31,771
they shuttered
that place so fast,

00:31:31,838 --> 00:31:33,306
they paid the stagehands

00:31:33,373 --> 00:31:36,409
in sugar bags full
of quarters and nickels,

00:31:36,476 --> 00:31:37,910
and they were gone.

00:31:37,977 --> 00:31:40,013
Melchior Wilson's arrest
must have set a speed record

00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:42,081
for closing a homicide,
huh, Sheriff?

00:31:42,148 --> 00:31:44,283
Those were the days.

00:31:49,355 --> 00:31:51,290
SCHLATTER:
Turns a five.

00:31:52,792 --> 00:31:54,594
MAN:
I fold.

00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:56,396
Sheriff?

00:31:56,462 --> 00:31:58,464
Twenty.

00:31:58,531 --> 00:32:00,633
You in or out?

00:32:05,738 --> 00:32:07,306

00:32:08,875 --> 00:32:10,810
Twenty.

00:32:10,877 --> 00:32:13,479
You haven't raised once.

00:32:13,546 --> 00:32:16,516
Either the county's
still not paying you enough,

00:32:16,582 --> 00:32:17,950
or you're bluffing.

00:32:21,921 --> 00:32:23,723
All in.

00:32:26,059 --> 00:32:28,761
Call.

00:32:30,296 --> 00:32:32,498
Now is when
you show your hand, Sheriff.

00:32:32,565 --> 00:32:36,335
Dead man's hand--
aces and eights.

00:32:36,402 --> 00:32:38,671
Straight.

00:32:40,006 --> 00:32:42,041
Hell...

00:32:42,108 --> 00:32:45,445
I used to be able
to bluff better.

00:32:45,511 --> 00:32:48,114
Wilson signed a confession.

00:32:48,181 --> 00:32:50,550
Yeah.

00:32:50,616 --> 00:32:52,985
But they say some of you guys
used to drive suspects

00:32:53,052 --> 00:32:55,054
out into the dessert,
show them a hole in the ground,

00:32:55,121 --> 00:32:56,389
give them a choice
to sign a confession

00:32:56,456 --> 00:32:58,057
or get in the hole.

00:32:58,124 --> 00:33:00,326
We got a good, clean print.

00:33:00,393 --> 00:33:03,296
The file says that
you lifted the print

00:33:03,363 --> 00:33:05,565
from Rosenthal's
alligator wallet.

00:33:05,631 --> 00:33:07,333
Now I examined it.

00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,503
Alligator skin
would've left voids.

00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:13,406

Well, you knew.

00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:47,013
Why did you ask me
to go and look at him?

00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:51,351
We think he may be the man
that murdered your husband.

00:37:52,885 --> 00:37:54,721
He didn't shoot Jules.

00:37:55,822 --> 00:37:58,124
I know, because I was there.

00:37:58,191 --> 00:38:01,327
Do you know
Sheriff Montgomery?

00:38:01,394 --> 00:38:03,196
Very well.

00:38:03,262 --> 00:38:07,433
Well, I promise you there is
no evidence incriminating Harry.

00:38:12,105 --> 00:38:14,240
You seem to me to be a woman

00:38:14,307 --> 00:38:17,076
who doesn't change
her tastes very often.

00:38:20,046 --> 00:38:22,448
I noticed last night
you had a fine bottle

00:38:22,515 --> 00:38:25,218
of pink champagne
in your car.

00:38:25,284 --> 00:38:29,589
It's the same rare champagne
that was found in the room

00:38:29,655 --> 00:38:32,658
where your husband
was murdered.

00:38:32,725 --> 00:38:37,096
Now... champagne usually
suggests a celebration.

00:38:37,163 --> 00:38:40,366
Or, maybe, in this case...

00:38:40,433 --> 00:38:42,235

00:38:48,074 --> 00:38:50,576
We had nowhere to be together.

00:38:50,643 --> 00:38:54,614
So we took a chance

<i>Shoved her.</i>

let that happen.

00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:13,513
You know, to most people,
risk is a bad thing,

00:42:13,579 --> 00:42:15,948
but in Vegas,
it's a good thing.

00:42:16,015 --> 00:42:19,786
See? You paid
for your pigs,

00:42:19,852 --> 00:42:23,589
you got roots,
friends, family...

00:42:23,656 --> 00:42:25,625
Well, a work family anyway.

00:42:26,959 --> 00:42:29,796
Maybe it's time
to up the ante.
