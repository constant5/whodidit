00:00:02,762 --> 00:00:06,466
(thunder rumbling)

00:00:16,511 --> 00:00:21,485
(cyclists panting)

00:00:36,637 --> 00:00:39,073
(panting)

00:00:42,411 --> 00:00:44,814
(groaning)

00:00:45,848 --> 00:00:48,185
(panting)

00:01:05,407 --> 00:01:07,009
(gasps)

00:01:10,246 --> 00:01:11,381
(grunts)

00:01:11,448 --> 00:01:12,615
(screams)
Hey!

00:01:12,682 --> 00:01:14,518
He's got my purse!
Hey!

00:01:14,585 --> 00:01:15,586
(grunts)

00:01:20,092 --> 00:01:21,694
Call the cops, call 911.

00:01:21,761 --> 00:01:23,363
My phone was
in the purse.

00:01:23,429 --> 00:01:24,431
(sighs)

00:01:25,899 --> 00:01:28,703
Ma'am, excuse me,
I need to use your phone.

00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:32,942
Lady...

00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:34,744
Lady?

00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:37,814
(flies buzzing)

00:01:40,051 --> 00:01:41,986
(camera clicking)

00:01:42,053 --> 00:01:43,956
(indistinct background
radio communication)

00:01:44,023 --> 00:01:45,591
I got here as
fast as I could.

00:01:45,658 --> 00:01:46,960
My DFO in
Anthem took longer

00:01:47,027 --> 00:01:48,695
to clear than I expected,
but that's what happens

00:01:48,762 --> 00:01:50,798
when you don't have enough
bodies to cover the bodies.

00:01:58,741 --> 00:02:00,777
Oh...

00:02:00,843 --> 00:02:03,447
Uh...

00:02:03,514 --> 00:02:04,948
she forget to fall down?

00:02:05,015 --> 00:02:06,851
Lividity's fixed in
her ankles and feet.

00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:09,622
Suggests she died
in this position.

00:02:14,461 --> 00:02:16,229
I don't know if you saw
the weather report last night,

00:02:16,296 --> 00:02:18,099
<i>but there was dry lighting</i>
<i>in this area.</i>

00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:20,536
(Touch-Tone dialing)

00:02:20,602 --> 00:02:22,471
<i>A low voltage strike...</i>

00:02:23,472 --> 00:02:24,908
<i>...could have caused</i>

00:02:24,974 --> 00:02:27,510
<i>her arm muscles</i>
<i>to contract around the pole.</i>

00:02:27,578 --> 00:02:29,113
(thunder rumbling)

00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,414
GRISSOM:
And then what?

00:02:30,481 --> 00:02:31,416
Cadaveric spasms

00:02:31,483 --> 00:02:33,618
in her shoulder
and hand

00:02:33,685 --> 00:02:37,490
keeps the body
in position

00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:38,959
until rigor sets in?

00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:40,227
It's just a theory.
I'll tell Robbins

00:02:40,294 --> 00:02:42,296
to look for signs
of electrocution.

00:02:42,363 --> 00:02:44,165
Hi, guys.

00:02:44,232 --> 00:02:46,000
The callout was a 419.

00:02:46,067 --> 00:02:47,136
Where's the body?

00:02:48,871 --> 00:02:50,807
Ask her.

00:02:51,842 --> 00:02:54,979
Excuse me, ma'am.

00:02:55,046 --> 00:02:56,014
Ma'am?

00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,850

GRISSOM:
Nick can't help us.

00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:42,238
He just got a call out
at the Monte Carlo.

00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:43,974
In other words,
we're pulling another double.

00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:45,910
Why should today be
any different?

00:03:49,816 --> 00:03:51,718
There's no burn marks on the arm

00:03:51,784 --> 00:03:53,453
or hand
where she was touching the pole.

00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,455
Well, there's
no scoring

00:03:54,521 --> 00:03:57,191
or blackening on the dome,
either.


00:03:57,258 --> 00:03:59,494
No indication of a
lightning strike.


00:04:01,897 --> 00:04:04,200
The bulb's burned out.


00:04:04,266 --> 00:04:05,869
Maybe there's a short
in the wiring.


00:04:05,936 --> 00:04:08,238
Liver temp's 98, but ambient's
pushing a hundred.


00:04:08,305 --> 00:04:11,843
So the body could have warmed up
after death?


00:04:11,909 --> 00:04:12,845
No T.O.D.


00:04:12,911 --> 00:04:14,947
Sorry.


00:04:18,251 --> 00:04:20,354
Rigor's starting
to break.


00:04:20,421 --> 00:04:22,223
I'll take her prints.


00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:24,526
Her phone looks new.


00:04:24,593 --> 00:04:26,728
Hasn't even been
personalized yet.


00:04:26,795 --> 00:04:28,097
Who was she talking to?


00:04:28,164 --> 00:04:29,665
(phone beeping)


00:04:31,235 --> 00:04:33,837
MovieFone.


00:04:33,904 --> 00:04:36,708
She carrying I.D.?


00:04:38,844 --> 00:04:40,212
She's not carrying anything.


00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,380
Well, if someone
was going


00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:44,584
to rob her,
why not take the whole purse?


00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:47,855
Why waste time
emptying the contents?


00:04:47,922 --> 00:04:50,726
WEBSTER:
<i>So, lucky us-- the</i>
<i>lamppost lady's fingerprints</i>


00:04:50,793 --> 00:04:52,761
are in the system.


00:04:52,828 --> 00:04:53,763
She has a record?


00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:54,864
It's not that system.


00:04:54,931 --> 00:04:57,201
It's the health care
providers database.


00:04:57,268 --> 00:04:58,202
Name's Carla Peretti.


00:04:58,269 --> 00:05:00,304
She's an LPN
at Desert Palm.


00:05:00,371 --> 00:05:01,339
Captain Brass is
running background.


00:05:01,406 --> 00:05:02,340
Good.


00:05:02,407 --> 00:05:03,341
Where is everyone?


00:05:03,408 --> 00:05:04,677
They're in the break room
waiting.


00:05:04,744 --> 00:05:06,045
Waiting for what?


00:05:06,112 --> 00:05:08,415
For you.


00:05:08,482 --> 00:05:11,351
I know you got the memo;
I put it on your desk.


00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:14,789
My name's Patricia Alwick.


00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:15,925
I'm a peer counselor


00:05:15,991 --> 00:05:18,494
for the Police Employees
Assistance Program.


00:05:18,561 --> 00:05:19,930
I deal primarily
with law enforcement,


00:05:19,996 --> 00:05:22,599
which means I know that none
of you wants to listen to me,


00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:23,901
so I'll keep it short.


00:05:23,968 --> 00:05:25,870
With the death
of Warrick Brown,


00:05:25,937 --> 00:05:28,440
you've lost a colleague
and a friend.


00:05:28,507 --> 00:05:30,643
I'm here to help you
through it.


00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:33,646
Our conversations will be
informal and confidential.


00:05:34,682 --> 00:05:36,851
Are the sessions mandatory?
No.


00:05:36,917 --> 00:05:39,287
No, they're not,
but keep this in mind.


00:05:39,354 --> 00:05:40,756
Right now,
you might feel okay


00:05:40,822 --> 00:05:43,226
and that you can handle things
fine on your own,


00:05:43,292 --> 00:05:44,660
but sometimes,
if you're not looking,


00:05:44,727 --> 00:05:47,030
grief can sneak up
and bite you.


00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:48,465
I've been doing this
a long time.


00:05:48,532 --> 00:05:49,434
I know
what I'm talking about.


00:05:49,501 --> 00:05:51,636
Ms. Alwick
will be up


00:05:51,703 --> 00:05:52,737
in room 4-E.


00:05:52,804 --> 00:05:54,373
If you'd like
to make an appointment,


00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,477
call her at extension 2922.


00:05:57,544 --> 00:05:59,546
All right, guys,
we're done.


00:05:59,613 --> 00:06:01,649
Thanks for coming.


00:06:05,654 --> 00:06:07,656
WOMAN:
What, no gun?


00:06:07,723 --> 00:06:09,993
WOMAN 2:
Sorry.


00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:12,897
Well, maybe later, then.


00:06:12,963 --> 00:06:14,465
Thanks.


00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:47,574
Hello.


00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,377
Hi.


00:06:51,378 --> 00:06:52,713
Would you like
to make an appointment?


00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:55,917
No.


00:06:55,984 --> 00:06:57,086
I'm new here.


00:06:57,153 --> 00:06:59,922
Hence the new
guy manuals.


00:06:59,989 --> 00:07:01,391
Excuse me.


00:07:05,997 --> 00:07:08,734
You know, joining
an established team,


00:07:08,801 --> 00:07:09,735
particularly under
these circumstances--


00:07:09,802 --> 00:07:12,672
it's not going
to be easy for you.


00:07:12,739 --> 00:07:15,243
Do you think I should quit?


00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:18,246
It may not be easy
on your colleagues, either.


00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:19,882
Well, there's nothing I can do
about that.


00:07:19,948 --> 00:07:20,883
Of course
there is.


00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:22,518
I'm happy to discuss...


00:07:22,584 --> 00:07:24,287
Look, I'm-- this is day one.


00:07:24,354 --> 00:07:25,388
I don't know


00:07:25,455 --> 00:07:27,358
these people,
they don't know me.


00:07:27,425 --> 00:07:30,060
It's going to work out
however it works out.


00:07:30,128 --> 00:07:31,563
Uh-huh.


00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,031
You seem a bit defensive.


00:07:33,098 --> 00:07:35,001
(sighs)


00:07:35,067 --> 00:07:36,302
Don't do that, okay?


00:07:36,369 --> 00:07:38,272
Do what?
"You seem a bit defensive."


00:07:38,338 --> 00:07:39,873
Both my parents are shrinks.


00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,876
I don't do the talk.


00:07:41,943 --> 00:07:44,646
Both your parents
are psychiatrists.

00:07:44,712 --> 00:07:46,949
Interesting.
Interesting.

00:07:47,016 --> 00:07:48,584
Are you Riley Adams?

00:07:48,651 --> 00:07:50,387
Yeah, that's me.

00:07:50,454 --> 00:07:51,421
I'm Gil Grissom,
your supervisor.

00:07:51,488 --> 00:07:52,422
We're very busy.

00:07:52,489 --> 00:07:53,491
Would you come
with me, please?

00:07:53,558 --> 00:07:56,094
Yeah.

00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,963
Good luck.

00:08:20,425 --> 00:08:22,561
Another transit patron
called it in.

00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:24,830
He was pissed the guy was taking
up the whole bench,

00:08:24,897 --> 00:08:26,867
so he tried to shove him over,

00:08:26,933 --> 00:08:30,004
which didn't work too well,
him being dead at the time.

00:08:30,071 --> 00:08:32,006
Hey, everybody.

00:08:32,073 --> 00:08:33,842
Oh, hi,
I'm David.

00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:35,677
Riley.

00:08:35,744 --> 00:08:38,548
He's all yours.

00:08:41,218 --> 00:08:43,420
No wallet.

00:08:43,487 --> 00:08:45,123
No cash or keys either.

00:08:47,492 --> 00:08:48,628
Body's in full rigor.

00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:49,762
Roll him.

00:08:56,237 --> 00:08:59,374
I saw that...

00:08:59,441 --> 00:09:01,210
and I'm not ever going
to forget it.

00:09:03,012 --> 00:09:04,581
(laughs)

00:09:04,648 --> 00:09:06,283
(anxious chuckle)

00:09:10,388 --> 00:09:12,758
What does lividity
tell you?

00:09:12,825 --> 00:09:15,128
That he was lying here
when he died.

00:09:15,195 --> 00:09:17,931
How do you know that?
'Cause I'm a CSI level two.

00:09:17,997 --> 00:09:21,335
And this is part
of your proficiency evaluation.

00:09:21,402 --> 00:09:23,205
Yeah, but it's pass-fail.

00:09:25,674 --> 00:09:28,711
Lividity's fixed
along the posterior aspect.

00:09:28,778 --> 00:09:31,281
Pressure marks are consistent
with the bench slats.

00:09:31,348 --> 00:09:33,016
Do we know how long
he's been here?

00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:34,452
Bus driver's certain
the guy wasn't here

00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:36,287
an hour and a half ago
when he made

00:09:36,354 --> 00:09:38,724
his previous stop.

00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:40,392
You see any problem
with that?

00:09:40,459 --> 00:09:43,964
Yeah, full rigor takes
12 to 24 hours to set.

00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:46,000
And if he's been here
less than 90 minutes,

00:09:46,067 --> 00:09:49,037
how does he end up
in full rigor?

00:09:49,104 --> 00:09:51,039
Well, he looks like
he was on a run.

00:09:51,106 --> 00:09:54,944
<i>Maybe he had a heart attack and</i>
<i>went into spontaneous rigor.</i>

00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,213
<i>Intense physical activity</i>

00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,016
<i>rapidly depletes</i>
<i>muscle fibers of ATP,</i>

00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:01,620
<i>which gives them the energy</i>
<i>they need to contract.</i>

00:10:01,686 --> 00:10:03,689
<i>If there's not enough ATP</i>
<i>at the time of death,</i>

00:10:03,756 --> 00:10:06,959
<i>the muscles can lock up</i>
<i>and immediately go into rigor.</i>

00:10:08,962 --> 00:10:10,197
What's bugging you?

00:10:10,264 --> 00:10:13,134
This is the second case
of rapid-onset rigor mortis

00:10:13,201 --> 00:10:15,037
we've had
in the last 24 hours.

00:10:15,104 --> 00:10:16,639
That's pretty weird.

00:10:16,705 --> 00:10:18,642
Even for Vegas.

00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:20,277
Brass checked Carla
Peretti's apartment.

00:10:20,343 --> 00:10:22,613
No forced entry or any
signs of disturbance.

00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,882
She was last seen alive
leaving Desert Palm Hospital

00:10:24,949 --> 00:10:26,118
at the end of her shift.

00:10:26,185 --> 00:10:27,486
Anybody know
where she was going?

00:10:27,553 --> 00:10:29,556
Well, apparently, it could
have been a lot of places.

00:10:29,622 --> 00:10:31,724
She was working a bunch
of jobs on the side--

00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:34,795
model, club dancer,
convention booth babe.

00:10:34,862 --> 00:10:36,998
You know, typical Vegas
pretty girl stuff.

00:10:37,065 --> 00:10:38,066
Mm-hmm.

00:10:38,133 --> 00:10:39,067
Autopsy report.

00:10:39,134 --> 00:10:40,602
Cause of death:

00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,904
cardiac arrest.

00:10:41,971 --> 00:10:43,206
That's coroner speak

00:10:43,272 --> 00:10:45,275
for "I can't explain
what killed her."
Yeah.

00:10:45,342 --> 00:10:47,945
No signs of
conductivity burns,

00:10:48,011 --> 00:10:50,949
no evidence of nuclear
streaming in the tissue.

00:10:51,015 --> 00:10:53,552
There's no indications of
electrocution whatsoever.

00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:55,554
There's other ways
for the muscles to seize up.

00:10:55,622 --> 00:10:56,790
You know,
maybe she was epileptic.

00:10:56,857 --> 00:11:00,161
Mm, sorry, no epilepsy drugs
in her system.

00:11:00,228 --> 00:11:02,063
People go off their meds
all the time.

00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:03,465
That's how they get seizures.

00:11:03,532 --> 00:11:05,534
Uh, she had
no medical history of epilepsy.

00:11:05,601 --> 00:11:08,404
But the disease doesn't leave
any physical record in the body.

00:11:08,471 --> 00:11:10,741
The tox panel
ruled out poisons and O.D.'s.

00:11:10,808 --> 00:11:12,076
She had a small
amount of zolpidem

00:11:12,143 --> 00:11:14,011
in her system, but
that stuff's in most

00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:15,247
over-the-counter
sleep aids these days.

00:11:15,313 --> 00:11:16,548
It's nothing
that would kill her.

00:11:16,615 --> 00:11:19,318
CATHERINE:
No organ damage.

00:11:19,385 --> 00:11:21,654
No disease, no trauma.

00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:25,092
This was a perfectly healthy
young woman.

00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:28,463
Yeah, till she dropped dead...
without dropping.

00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:43,215
Well, I always thought it was
cool that teeth fluoresced,

00:11:43,282 --> 00:11:44,417
but veneers didn't.

00:11:44,484 --> 00:11:45,718
How'd you get them?

00:11:45,785 --> 00:11:48,355
Somebody bet me
that I couldn't jump into a lake

00:11:48,422 --> 00:11:50,191
with a rope swing in my mouth.

00:11:50,257 --> 00:11:51,225
And that pulled
the teeth out?

00:11:51,292 --> 00:11:52,394
No.

00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,562
(beep)

00:11:53,628 --> 00:11:55,398
But it sure did hurt my neck.

00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:57,733
On the way home,
I hit a fire hydrant.

00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,636
And you bumped the steering
wheel with your mouth.

00:11:59,703 --> 00:12:02,072
No, I was on my bike
at the time.

00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:03,441
I flew over the hydrant

00:12:03,508 --> 00:12:06,044
and smashed into the crossbar
of a chain link fence.

00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:06,946
With your mouth.

00:12:07,012 --> 00:12:08,147
My shoulder.

00:12:08,214 --> 00:12:09,381
Broke my clavicle.

00:12:09,448 --> 00:12:11,084
Okay, then how'd
you lose the teeth?

00:12:11,151 --> 00:12:14,822
This one was a root canal.

00:12:14,889 --> 00:12:16,958
This one, a post
and a crown.

00:12:17,024 --> 00:12:19,394
And this one-- I, uh...

00:12:19,461 --> 00:12:20,562
I was in college.

00:12:20,629 --> 00:12:22,265
I woke up one morning,
and it was gone.

00:12:22,332 --> 00:12:23,600
I don't know
what happened to it.

00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:25,436
Al Robbins.

00:12:25,503 --> 00:12:26,804
Riley Adams.

00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,506
Pardon the latex.

00:12:28,572 --> 00:12:30,408
Okay.

00:12:30,475 --> 00:12:31,943
What do we got?

00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:34,580
Uh, somebody
who liked to party.

00:12:34,647 --> 00:12:37,150
Prelim tox showed traces

00:12:37,217 --> 00:12:39,586
of meth, E and heroin
in his system.

00:12:39,653 --> 00:12:41,923
Doesn't sound like someone who
would go for a run at midnight.

00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:43,758
ROBBINS:
I doubt this guy could've
run a hundred feet

00:12:43,825 --> 00:12:45,261
without stopping to rest.

00:12:45,327 --> 00:12:46,629
He had pulmonary edema.

00:12:46,695 --> 00:12:48,765
Fluid's backed up in the lungs.

00:12:48,832 --> 00:12:50,200
Sometimes suggests drug abuse.

00:12:50,267 --> 00:12:51,602
Is that C.O.D.?

00:12:51,669 --> 00:12:54,539
I doubt it.
The edema wasn't acute.

00:12:54,605 --> 00:12:56,542
Far as I can tell,
C.O.D. is cardiac arrest.

00:12:56,608 --> 00:12:58,810
Same as the lady in the park.

00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:01,981
Yeah, which brings us
to something interesting.

00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:03,284
The victim's liver.

00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,885
Note the slight

00:13:04,952 --> 00:13:07,522
reddish
and pinkish coloration.

00:13:07,589 --> 00:13:10,159
Very similar
to Carla Peretti.

00:13:10,226 --> 00:13:12,728
Assuming
the cases are connected,

00:13:12,795 --> 00:13:14,231
the condition of
the victims' livers

00:13:14,298 --> 00:13:16,967
might suggest
an alternate C.O.D.

00:13:17,034 --> 00:13:18,636
Gaseous asphyxiation.

00:13:18,703 --> 00:13:22,041
I'll have Hodges do
a blood gas assay.

00:13:25,312 --> 00:13:27,314
(sighs)

00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,243
DETECTIVE (on phone):
We walked the photo
of the jogger

00:13:50,309 --> 00:13:52,713
around the local
methadone clinic and got lucky.

00:13:52,779 --> 00:13:54,414
Name's Harley Soon.

00:13:54,481 --> 00:13:55,750
He has a sheet.

00:13:55,817 --> 00:13:58,353
Drug abuse, solicitation,
some other petty stuff.

00:13:58,419 --> 00:14:00,789
Juvie record, too,
but that's sealed.

00:14:00,856 --> 00:14:02,057
Thank you, Detective.

00:14:02,124 --> 00:14:03,226
No problem.

00:14:03,293 --> 00:14:04,461
(hangs up)

00:14:12,437 --> 00:14:14,340
You doing a
headspace assay?

00:14:14,407 --> 00:14:17,511
Yes, which is,
I believe, your job.

00:14:17,578 --> 00:14:19,713
Where have you been?

00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,850
I was just, uh... nowhere.

00:14:21,917 --> 00:14:24,352
You want me to finish up?

00:14:24,419 --> 00:14:26,022
I'm almost done.

00:14:33,798 --> 00:14:35,733
Um...

00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,770
hold on a second.

00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:39,672
What?

00:14:39,739 --> 00:14:41,775
You added
the liberating agent.

00:14:41,841 --> 00:14:43,109
Yes.

00:14:43,176 --> 00:14:45,112
You added the sulfuric.

00:14:45,179 --> 00:14:46,814
You skipped over

00:14:46,881 --> 00:14:48,617
the sodium dithionite?

00:14:48,684 --> 00:14:51,888
Yes, I think I did.

00:14:54,624 --> 00:14:58,295
I think I must have done it
with all of these.

00:14:58,362 --> 00:15:00,765
It's probably better to
redo the whole assay.

00:15:00,832 --> 00:15:03,369
Um, listen, I can get it.

00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:05,605
Should have been doing
it to begin with.

00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:06,874
(laughs)

00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,375
Don't worry
about it.

00:15:08,442 --> 00:15:10,245
I know it's
been a long day.

00:15:10,311 --> 00:15:11,579
Every day's a long day.

00:15:11,646 --> 00:15:15,017
(two beeps)

00:15:19,122 --> 00:15:20,958
(snaps phone shut)
I have to go.

00:15:21,025 --> 00:15:23,027
Thank you.

00:15:27,065 --> 00:15:28,368
(clamoring,
siren wails in distance)

00:15:28,434 --> 00:15:31,237
MAN:
5:30 a.m. I don't pick up
"those people,"

00:15:31,304 --> 00:15:32,806
if you know
what I'm saying.

00:15:32,873 --> 00:15:34,675
I don't care
how nicely dressed they are.

00:15:34,742 --> 00:15:36,278
Hey, hey, hey,
that's illegal.

00:15:36,344 --> 00:15:39,414
Yeah, which is why I stopped
and told him to hop in,

00:15:39,482 --> 00:15:42,184
but he just stood there
like that, stock still.

00:15:42,251 --> 00:15:44,621
Creeped me out,
I don't mind telling you.

00:15:44,688 --> 00:15:46,023
You're gonna love this.

00:15:46,089 --> 00:15:47,892
CABBIE:
Uh...

00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:49,961
(camera shutters clicking
nearby)

00:15:59,907 --> 00:16:02,511
I've heard of dying
with your boots on, but, uh,

00:16:02,578 --> 00:16:05,180
this is ridiculous.

00:16:15,093 --> 00:16:16,361
(bones crunching)

00:16:16,428 --> 00:16:18,431
(grunts)

00:16:18,928 --> 00:16:20,730
Businessman
with an empty briefcase.

00:16:20,797 --> 00:16:22,132
No wallet or I.D.

00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:23,533
Consistent with
the other vics.

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,736
We got a serial killer, Greg,

00:16:25,803 --> 00:16:28,640
and he's working at a pace
of one body per day.

00:16:28,707 --> 00:16:31,276
Great. Something to look
forward to tomorrow.

00:16:33,046 --> 00:16:35,348
Damn!
This thing is heavy.

00:16:39,921 --> 00:16:42,023
He's got lead in the sole
of his shoe.

00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:45,895
Must be what was keeping
him on his feet.

00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:51,936
There's a coating
of dust on here.

00:16:52,003 --> 00:16:54,005
GRISSOM: His fingernails
have been recently trimmed,

00:16:54,072 --> 00:16:57,543
but they're filthy at the beds.

00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:59,379
And he's got dirt in his ears.

00:16:59,446 --> 00:17:02,216
His feet and ankles are
all scabbed and crusty

00:17:02,283 --> 00:17:05,387
and his toenails are growing
back into his toes.

00:17:05,454 --> 00:17:06,788
This guy's been cleaned up,

00:17:06,855 --> 00:17:08,991
but I'll bet you
he lived on the street.

00:17:17,802 --> 00:17:19,838
Yep. Head lice.

00:17:19,905 --> 00:17:22,475
They're all dead.

00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:25,045
Good.
I hate those little bastards.

00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:27,281
So we've got three victims,

00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:28,983
all stripped
of their identities.

00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:31,052
A homeless guy dressed
like a businessman,

00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:33,689
a hustler druggie dressed
like a runner,

00:17:33,756 --> 00:17:35,725
and a nurse...

00:17:35,792 --> 00:17:37,794
dressed like herself.

00:17:37,861 --> 00:17:39,864
What do they have in common?

00:17:41,265 --> 00:17:43,402
Tox found traces
of zolpidem in all three.

00:17:43,468 --> 00:17:44,870
Other than that,

00:17:44,937 --> 00:17:46,606
we're comparing
all the trace evidence

00:17:46,673 --> 00:17:48,474
from the victims' clothing
and personal effects,

00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:50,611
but so far,
nothing probative.

00:17:50,678 --> 00:17:54,449
ADAMS:
PD is circulating photos
of the businessman around

00:17:54,516 --> 00:17:56,051
shelters and soup kitchens
in the area,

00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:57,787
but there's no I.D. yet.

00:17:57,853 --> 00:17:59,355
This girl's an LPN.

00:17:59,422 --> 00:18:01,157
Maybe her hospital's
the connection.

00:18:01,224 --> 00:18:03,994
RILEY:
According to Harley Soon's
medical records,

00:18:04,061 --> 00:18:06,130
he was never treated
at Desert Palm.

00:18:06,197 --> 00:18:07,899
Well, Carla Peretti
is the one victim

00:18:07,966 --> 00:18:09,235
who had a mainstream life.

00:18:09,301 --> 00:18:10,836
That means e-mails,
phone calls, documents.

00:18:10,903 --> 00:18:13,340
If there's anything
that connects these people,

00:18:13,406 --> 00:18:15,575
the way to find it
is through her.

00:18:27,156 --> 00:18:30,928
Looks like
she was an art student.

00:18:41,842 --> 00:18:44,345
ADAMS:
Ah...

00:18:44,412 --> 00:18:46,382
The naughty drawer.

00:18:46,448 --> 00:18:47,583
What?

00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:50,086
(sniffing)

00:18:50,153 --> 00:18:52,455
Hydroponic,
medical grade,

00:18:52,522 --> 00:18:56,427
put-you-on-your-ass,
send-you-to-dreamyland weed.

00:18:56,494 --> 00:18:58,363
Nurses always get
the good stuff.

00:18:58,430 --> 00:18:59,798
Uh...

00:18:59,865 --> 00:19:01,133
take it you're aware

00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,937
of the lab's
random drug testing policy?

00:19:04,003 --> 00:19:05,272
Oh, yeah.

00:19:05,339 --> 00:19:07,875
I've got a bottle
of clean urine in my locker,

00:19:07,942 --> 00:19:09,611
just in case.

00:19:09,678 --> 00:19:11,913
I'm kidding.

00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,916
(forced laugh)

00:19:13,983 --> 00:19:15,651
Good one.

00:19:15,718 --> 00:19:18,155
Here, I'll bag it.

00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:28,134
Check this out.

00:19:28,201 --> 00:19:30,270
An original of Carla.

00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:33,641
Bizarre. She looks kind of...

00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:34,609
Dead?

00:19:34,675 --> 00:19:35,677
Yeah, a little.

00:19:35,744 --> 00:19:37,813
What's that say?


00:19:37,879 --> 00:19:40,516
J... Skaggs?


00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:42,519
Never heard
of him.
Me, neither.

00:19:42,586 --> 00:19:45,322
I bet somebody has.

00:19:47,826 --> 00:19:50,229
(beep)

00:19:51,931 --> 00:19:54,001
What do you know.

00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:56,169
He's a local.

00:20:10,288 --> 00:20:12,224
Hey!

00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:14,026
Jerzey Skaggs?

00:20:14,092 --> 00:20:16,829
Jerzey? Skaggs?

00:20:16,896 --> 00:20:19,032
Hey! Jerzey Skaggs?

00:20:19,098 --> 00:20:21,568
Who are you?

00:20:21,635 --> 00:20:23,905
Homicide.

00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:26,107
This might look good
in my living room.

00:20:26,174 --> 00:20:28,711
You can't afford it.

00:20:28,778 --> 00:20:30,379
Your arm down,
and wake up.

00:20:30,446 --> 00:20:31,615
Wake up!

00:20:35,253 --> 00:20:36,654
What do you want?

00:20:36,721 --> 00:20:37,989
Do you know Carla Peretti?

00:20:38,056 --> 00:20:39,191
Who?

00:20:39,258 --> 00:20:40,526
Carla Peretti.

00:20:40,593 --> 00:20:43,163
Oh, yeah...
yeah, she was one

00:20:43,229 --> 00:20:44,397
of my models.

00:20:44,464 --> 00:20:46,000
She's a lovely girl.

00:20:46,067 --> 00:20:47,835
It's a cheap
imitation of my work.

00:20:47,902 --> 00:20:50,439
Well, you'll have to take it up
with the coroner,

00:20:50,505 --> 00:20:52,674
because she's dead for real.

00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:55,678
I'm sorry to hear that.

00:20:55,745 --> 00:20:57,348
You paint these guys?

00:20:57,414 --> 00:20:58,749
No. Never saw
those guys

00:20:58,816 --> 00:21:00,952
before in my life.

00:21:06,092 --> 00:21:08,795
You know, Harley Soon

00:21:08,862 --> 00:21:11,632
used to crash at a buddy's
apartment in the neighborhood.

00:21:11,698 --> 00:21:13,701
Relax.

00:21:15,169 --> 00:21:17,640
And he seems
to be kind of your type.

00:21:17,706 --> 00:21:21,378
Huh? So maybe you, uh...
maybe you bumped into him

00:21:21,444 --> 00:21:23,948
at the grocery store
or something.

00:21:24,015 --> 00:21:25,182
I don't go out.

00:21:25,249 --> 00:21:26,885
I don't shop.

00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,987
I don't bump.

00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:30,389
But you do paint dead people.

00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:31,758
I paint people
who look dead,

00:21:31,824 --> 00:21:33,159
and you would weep

00:21:33,226 --> 00:21:35,529
if you knew
how much I make doing that.

00:21:35,596 --> 00:21:37,231
If you haven't noticed,

00:21:37,298 --> 00:21:40,101
our culture seems to be obsessed
with sex and death.

00:21:40,168 --> 00:21:41,904
I've noticed.

00:21:41,971 --> 00:21:43,472
Let me save you some time,

00:21:43,539 --> 00:21:45,308
'cause I know
what's on your mind.

00:21:45,374 --> 00:21:46,643
I don't kill my models.

00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:48,478
I don't even bang them
much anymore.

00:21:48,545 --> 00:21:50,448
Occasionally, of course, but...

00:21:50,515 --> 00:21:54,620
oh, I find not
with the same gusto and verve

00:21:54,687 --> 00:21:56,622
as in days gone by.

00:21:56,689 --> 00:21:57,958
You bang Carla Peretti?

00:21:58,024 --> 00:22:00,661
I'm not doing women.

00:22:00,728 --> 00:22:03,664
Mind if I look around?

00:22:03,731 --> 00:22:07,803
I'd like to paint you nude.

00:22:07,869 --> 00:22:09,806
I don't do nude.

00:22:09,872 --> 00:22:11,441
Where would I pin the badge?

00:22:11,507 --> 00:22:13,811
Exactly.

00:22:13,877 --> 00:22:16,881
(machine whirring)

00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:31,166
Ms. Alwick.

00:22:31,233 --> 00:22:32,334
Dr. Grissom.

00:22:32,401 --> 00:22:33,669
Were you looking
for me?

00:22:33,736 --> 00:22:36,039
No, just getting
some more tea.

00:22:36,106 --> 00:22:38,843
I was hoping we might
get a chance to chat.

00:22:38,909 --> 00:22:40,811
I'm right in the
middle of a case.

00:22:40,878 --> 00:22:42,014
I know, I understand

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,749
that you're dealing
with a lot, but, um,

00:22:43,815 --> 00:22:45,918
if you do find the time...

00:22:45,985 --> 00:22:48,321
Thank you, I appreciate that.

00:22:51,725 --> 00:22:53,762
This, uh, may be
outside your field

00:22:53,828 --> 00:22:56,532
of expertise, but...

00:22:56,599 --> 00:22:59,402
lately, I've been having
some problems with Hank.

00:22:59,468 --> 00:23:01,104
HODGES:
Grissom.

00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:02,906
Oh, hi, Patricia.

00:23:02,973 --> 00:23:04,142
Nice to see you again, David.

00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:07,780
The headspace assay came back
and showed levels

00:23:07,846 --> 00:23:09,548
of carbon monoxide
in all the vics,

00:23:09,615 --> 00:23:12,519
as well as the dead lice
on the businessman's head.

00:23:12,585 --> 00:23:14,621
Excuse me.

00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:19,394
STOKES:
Mostly simple hydrocarbons
and sulfur dioxide,

00:23:19,461 --> 00:23:20,963
along with the
carbon monoxide.

00:23:21,029 --> 00:23:22,732
That's consistent with
gasoline engine exhaust.

00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:23,967
Yeah, and since the lice

00:23:24,033 --> 00:23:26,169
on the homeless guy died,
it suggests that he

00:23:26,235 --> 00:23:28,472
was completely surrounded
by exhaust fumes,

00:23:28,539 --> 00:23:31,109
not suffocated
with a mask or a tube.

00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:32,544
WILLOWS:
Or locked in a sealed car,

00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:33,980
for that matter-- there
wouldn't have been

00:23:34,046 --> 00:23:35,781
enough room to pose them.

00:23:35,848 --> 00:23:38,785
Lividity says
the victims died

00:23:38,852 --> 00:23:41,956
in the positions
in which they were discovered.

00:23:42,023 --> 00:23:43,491
So, what does that mean,
that the killer

00:23:43,558 --> 00:23:44,792
is using some sort
of gas chamber?

00:23:44,859 --> 00:23:46,562
I think so.

00:23:46,628 --> 00:23:49,399
<i>He lures someone</i>
<i>back to his place,</i>

00:23:49,466 --> 00:23:51,568
<i>slips them a sedative,</i>

00:23:51,634 --> 00:23:53,571
<i>then redresses</i>
<i>and positions the bodies</i>

00:23:53,638 --> 00:23:56,341
<i>inside a sealed container.</i>

00:23:56,408 --> 00:23:59,511
<i>Waits for the carbon monoxide</i>
<i>to go to work.</i>

00:23:59,578 --> 00:24:01,147
Once the bodies
are in full rigor,

00:24:01,214 --> 00:24:02,415
he's got about ten hours

00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:05,019
to place them
and have them discovered.

00:24:06,353 --> 00:24:08,523
Now that we know the recipe,
let's find the cook.

00:24:13,629 --> 00:24:14,897
(chirping)

00:24:14,965 --> 00:24:17,601
(gasping excitedly)

00:24:23,475 --> 00:24:24,677
(whispering):
Hey...

00:24:24,743 --> 00:24:30,651
I believe I just sighted
<i>Aeronautes saxatalis.</i>

00:24:30,718 --> 00:24:33,354
<i>Aeronautes saxatalis,</i>

00:24:33,421 --> 00:24:35,023
the white-throated swift.

00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:37,960
They hardly ever range this far
south this time of year.

00:24:43,901 --> 00:24:45,970
STOKES:
<i>The elderly couple</i>
<i>was suffering from Alzheimer's.</i>

00:24:46,037 --> 00:24:48,006
They were on
a little field trip

00:24:48,073 --> 00:24:49,475
from their
assisted care facility

00:24:49,542 --> 00:24:50,676
day before yesterday.

00:24:50,743 --> 00:24:52,512
Staff didn't even realize
they were missing

00:24:52,579 --> 00:24:53,914
till bed check.

00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:56,517
What, no surveillance cameras
on the bird-watching path?

00:24:56,584 --> 00:24:58,519
No, but the unis
did turn up a crackhead

00:24:58,586 --> 00:25:00,155
who said he saw
an average-height

00:25:00,222 --> 00:25:02,157
white male
in a white panel van

00:25:02,224 --> 00:25:04,461
near the trail,
about an hour before dawn.

00:25:04,527 --> 00:25:06,396
MAN (over speaker):
Caught in their
quotidian routines,

00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:11,536
these haunting figures,
frozen in time, seem to mock

00:25:11,603 --> 00:25:15,808
the mundane blandness
that screams silently

00:25:15,875 --> 00:25:17,810
beneath the sizzle
of Sin City.

00:25:17,877 --> 00:25:19,179
What is this?

00:25:19,246 --> 00:25:20,381
Local art blog.

00:25:20,447 --> 00:25:22,550
Our psycho is the hot topic.

00:25:22,617 --> 00:25:24,152
They call him
the "Mannekiller."

00:25:24,219 --> 00:25:26,455
...perhaps, finally,
by using the flesh

00:25:26,522 --> 00:25:30,660
of human beings
to replicate the flesh

00:25:30,727 --> 00:25:32,929
of human beings...

00:25:32,996 --> 00:25:36,467
this madman
who moves silently among us

00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:39,538
has crossed art's
final frontier.

00:25:39,605 --> 00:25:41,374
This is Langston Weller,

00:25:41,441 --> 00:25:43,510
signing off
from mindscanvas.com.

00:25:43,576 --> 00:25:44,979
This site's been
getting hammered.

00:25:45,046 --> 00:25:46,614
Check out the comments.

00:25:46,681 --> 00:25:48,550
STOKES:
"You're a one-man argument

00:25:48,617 --> 00:25:49,551
against free speech."

00:25:49,618 --> 00:25:52,121
"This is murder,
pure and simple,

00:25:52,188 --> 00:25:54,023
and you're a moron."

00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:56,827
"Hitler was right--
kill the artists first."

00:25:56,894 --> 00:25:59,396
At least nobody's buying
this crap.

00:25:59,463 --> 00:26:00,699
"Vibrant images

00:26:00,765 --> 00:26:04,203
"of life culled
from the raw stuff of death.

00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:07,207
These <i>are</i> works of art."

00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:11,379
Apparently, there are some
who share this aesthetic.

00:26:14,082 --> 00:26:16,618
SANDERS:
The dust found inside
the businessman's shoes

00:26:16,685 --> 00:26:19,022
was actually undyed jute fibers.

00:26:19,089 --> 00:26:21,291
The same fibers were
also found on tape lifts

00:26:21,358 --> 00:26:22,960
from the other
vic's clothes.

00:26:23,027 --> 00:26:25,897
Killer's probably
covering his vics

00:26:25,964 --> 00:26:28,567
in woven jute--
i.e., burlap--

00:26:28,633 --> 00:26:30,370
at some point
during the process.

00:26:30,436 --> 00:26:31,738
Thanks, Greg.

00:26:31,804 --> 00:26:33,440
You bet.

00:26:35,743 --> 00:26:38,413
Dr. Grissom, may I have
a word with you?

00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,048
Yes, of course.

00:26:40,115 --> 00:26:41,183
Come in.

00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:44,086
I wonder why it is
that you hold what I do

00:26:44,153 --> 00:26:45,889
in such obvious contempt.

00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:48,226
Excuse me?

00:26:48,292 --> 00:26:49,694
The last time we spoke,
you mentioned

00:26:49,761 --> 00:26:51,295
that you were having problems
with Hank.

00:26:51,362 --> 00:26:53,599
Now, out of
concern for you

00:26:53,665 --> 00:26:55,267
and because I take my job
very seriously,

00:26:55,334 --> 00:26:56,269
I started asking around.

00:26:56,336 --> 00:26:59,039
Oh...
And was met
by a mixture

00:26:59,105 --> 00:27:00,941
of bafflement and
smirks by most

00:27:01,008 --> 00:27:04,379
of your staff, until
David Hodges took pity on me

00:27:04,446 --> 00:27:07,383
and informed me that
Hank was your dog.

00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:08,718
I apologize.

00:27:08,785 --> 00:27:10,153
It was
a serious question.

00:27:10,219 --> 00:27:11,722
Oh, really?

00:27:11,789 --> 00:27:16,561
For the last few weeks,
my dog's been listless.

00:27:16,628 --> 00:27:19,065
Barely eats.

00:27:19,131 --> 00:27:23,403
And I just, uh, wondered
if you thought it was possible

00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:27,275
that pets could take on
the emotions of their owners.

00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:32,114
Well...

00:27:32,181 --> 00:27:36,319
companion animals were bred
to respond to human beings.

00:27:36,386 --> 00:27:41,560
At some level, I do
believe that they resonate

00:27:41,626 --> 00:27:44,464
with what their
owners are feeling.

00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:47,935
So, what are you feeling?

00:27:50,771 --> 00:27:56,178
I've just been...
a little distracted lately.

00:27:56,245 --> 00:28:00,117
Uh, having a hard time focusing
on the details.

00:28:00,183 --> 00:28:01,485
That's normal.

00:28:01,551 --> 00:28:03,321
Not for me.

00:28:09,261 --> 00:28:14,802
I wondered, uh, if you knew,
typically, how long this lasts.

00:28:14,869 --> 00:28:16,604
There's no typical.

00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:19,775
Days, weeks, sometimes years.

00:28:19,841 --> 00:28:22,779
The important thing
is to acknowledge it.

00:28:22,845 --> 00:28:25,983
But you do have
to talk about it.

00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:29,621
And if not with me, then
with somebody else.

00:28:29,687 --> 00:28:32,057
And soon.

00:28:32,123 --> 00:28:35,361
(phone ringing)

00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:39,066
Jim, got something?

00:28:39,132 --> 00:28:41,169
BRASS:
Yeah, Harley Soon's
juvie record.

00:28:41,235 --> 00:28:43,404
I got the court administrator
to unseal it.

00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:45,941
He was arrested five years ago
in a drug raid

00:28:46,008 --> 00:28:49,546
on a party at the art studio
of Jerzy Skaggs.

00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:53,584
BRASS:
So, how do you
like my studio?

00:28:53,651 --> 00:28:54,985
This is ridiculous.

00:28:55,052 --> 00:28:56,521
No, what's
ridiculous

00:28:56,588 --> 00:28:58,623
is you denying
that you knew Harley Soon.

00:28:59,425 --> 00:29:00,293
What?

00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:01,661
Party was five years ago.

00:29:01,728 --> 00:29:03,197
The kid was 16
at the time.

00:29:03,263 --> 00:29:04,832
You should have been
busted for that, too.

00:29:04,898 --> 00:29:06,066
Listen to me--

00:29:06,133 --> 00:29:09,771
everybody who was anybody
came to my parties.

00:29:09,838 --> 00:29:13,442
And many like yourself,
who are nobody at all.

00:29:13,509 --> 00:29:14,978
You know, I just...

00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:18,750
I can't remember everybody
who came to my parties.

00:29:18,816 --> 00:29:20,718
All right, so you
reconnected

00:29:20,785 --> 00:29:22,054
with Harley Soon...

00:29:22,121 --> 00:29:24,690
and you're connected
with Carla Peretti.

00:29:24,757 --> 00:29:27,594
A lot of people you know
are turning up dead.

00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:30,698
You're telling me these
are actual dead people?

00:29:30,765 --> 00:29:32,467
Come on, it's been
all over the news.

00:29:32,534 --> 00:29:35,604
I don't... I don't watch TV.

00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:38,908
And I only use the Internet
to make money.

00:29:38,975 --> 00:29:40,611
Man, that is wild.

00:29:40,677 --> 00:29:43,647
Death just mocking life.

00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:47,118
(making whooshing sounds)

00:29:48,154 --> 00:29:49,722
Are you done?

00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:51,625
You know, these look familiar.

00:29:51,691 --> 00:29:53,293
Yeah, I bet
they do.

00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,062
No, no, no, no, not the...

00:29:55,129 --> 00:29:56,731
not the people, the poses.

00:29:56,798 --> 00:30:00,102
Somebody... somebody
showed me drawings

00:30:00,169 --> 00:30:02,271
like these,
months ago.

00:30:04,007 --> 00:30:07,344
<i>These people remind me</i>
<i>of those wretched sketches.</i>

00:30:08,379 --> 00:30:10,148
MAN:
Excuse me,
Mr. Skaggs.

00:30:10,215 --> 00:30:11,516
If I could
have a moment,

00:30:11,583 --> 00:30:14,387
would you mind taking
a quick look at these?

00:30:19,927 --> 00:30:22,931
Uh-uh... uh-uh.

00:30:22,997 --> 00:30:25,000
I can't stand looking
at inferior art.

00:30:25,067 --> 00:30:26,335
It just...

00:30:26,402 --> 00:30:30,674
it sears into my consciousness
like bad Mexican food.

00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:32,276
Who was he?

00:30:32,343 --> 00:30:35,146
No, I don't remember,
but he was, you know,

00:30:35,213 --> 00:30:37,349
babbling about some insipid

00:30:37,416 --> 00:30:39,451
municipal
sculpture...

00:30:39,518 --> 00:30:41,121
competition
he was hoping to win.

00:30:41,187 --> 00:30:44,125
Open... to the public.

00:30:44,191 --> 00:30:45,526
Oh, okay, so he was an artist.

00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:47,829
No, he was some kind
of contractor,

00:30:47,896 --> 00:30:49,865
subcontractor,
sub-subcontractor,

00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,801
sub-sub-subcontractor.

00:30:51,868 --> 00:30:53,703
I think my... my
studio was, uh,

00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:54,938
being renovated, and it was...

00:30:55,005 --> 00:30:56,406
you know, it was a big job.

00:30:56,473 --> 00:30:57,841
There was lots of...
lots of manual...

00:30:57,908 --> 00:30:59,511
labor involved.

00:30:59,577 --> 00:31:00,712
I need a name.

00:31:00,779 --> 00:31:02,515
He was a laborer--
why would I know his name?

00:31:02,581 --> 00:31:03,849
Because you hired him.

00:31:03,916 --> 00:31:05,551
I didn't hire him.

00:31:05,618 --> 00:31:08,255
One of those contractors
hired him.

00:31:08,321 --> 00:31:10,024
And no, I don't remember
his name.

00:31:10,091 --> 00:31:12,193
I... I barely remember
your name.

00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:14,029
What is your name?

00:31:15,764 --> 00:31:17,934
Eight months ago, the city
sponsored a competition

00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:20,003
to create a series
of bronze lifelike statues

00:31:20,069 --> 00:31:21,906
for its parks
and public spaces.

00:31:21,972 --> 00:31:24,442
"Las Vegas: for the
rest of your life".

00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:26,745
Yeah, and all the applications
were submitted digitally.

00:31:26,812 --> 00:31:28,381
This is what the Parks
Department sent over.

00:31:28,448 --> 00:31:30,616
Hey, take a look
at this one.

00:31:30,683 --> 00:31:33,120
It's a submission
from an Arthur Blisterman.

00:31:33,187 --> 00:31:34,388
Look at this.

00:31:34,455 --> 00:31:36,958
Jackpot, huh?

00:31:37,025 --> 00:31:38,560
The rules stated that...

00:31:38,626 --> 00:31:40,262
the sculpture
should recreate the ethnic

00:31:40,329 --> 00:31:42,898
and socioeconomic diversity
that make the city

00:31:42,965 --> 00:31:44,367
so vibrant and alive.

00:31:44,434 --> 00:31:46,971
This guy was following them
to the letter.

00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:48,840
Yeah, except that he
was substituting bronze

00:31:48,906 --> 00:31:50,641
with human flesh.

00:31:50,709 --> 00:31:52,978
Guys, there's a, uh,
sculpture number six here.

00:31:53,045 --> 00:31:54,714
We only found five bodies.

00:31:54,781 --> 00:31:56,616
GRISSOM:
Oh, God.

00:31:56,683 --> 00:31:58,452
He's not done.

00:32:00,804 --> 00:32:02,473
So, we got Blisterman's house
staked out.

00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:04,275
The neighbors
haven't seen him for weeks.

00:32:04,342 --> 00:32:06,011
Now, the guy's unmarried,
got no criminal record.

00:32:06,078 --> 00:32:07,112
He's an independent
plumbing contractor,

00:32:07,179 --> 00:32:08,347
so he makes
his own schedule,

00:32:08,414 --> 00:32:09,582
and he's not answering
his phone.

00:32:09,649 --> 00:32:11,217
No, he has a white panel van.

00:32:11,284 --> 00:32:12,652
We got a broadcast out.

00:32:12,719 --> 00:32:14,755
GRISSOM:
He's got to have some kind
of work space

00:32:14,822 --> 00:32:16,724
or studio, somewhere
he can come and go unnoticed.

00:32:16,791 --> 00:32:18,560
Look, there's nothing on record.

00:32:18,627 --> 00:32:21,197
We've released a picture,
we've notified the schools

00:32:21,264 --> 00:32:22,799
and Child Services
to be on alert.

00:32:22,865 --> 00:32:24,335
Right now,
that's all we can do.

00:32:25,369 --> 00:32:29,574
Why do you think
people make art?

00:32:29,641 --> 00:32:31,811
Self-expression.

00:32:31,877 --> 00:32:34,880
Yeah, but I think
also to...

00:32:34,947 --> 00:32:37,985
provoke or elicit
a reaction.

00:32:38,051 --> 00:32:41,189
Maybe the killer's
into the controversy of it.

00:32:41,255 --> 00:32:43,926
I think one of these blog
posters might be our guy.

00:32:43,993 --> 00:32:45,294
Maybe.

00:32:46,328 --> 00:32:47,530
Click on that photo link.

00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:53,904
What?

00:32:53,971 --> 00:32:55,607
There's no yellow tape.

00:32:55,674 --> 00:32:57,843
No bystanders.
No crime scene.

00:32:57,909 --> 00:32:59,479
Let me the check the metadata.

00:33:01,982 --> 00:33:05,252
This photo was taken
at 5:49 a.m.

00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:07,255
The body wasn't
reported till after 7:00.

00:33:07,322 --> 00:33:09,425
I guess our "artist"
couldn't resist

00:33:09,492 --> 00:33:11,794
a snapshot of his first
installation.

00:33:11,861 --> 00:33:13,864
"Anonymous" is Blisterman.

00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:15,132
WELLER:
How much trouble am I in?

00:33:15,198 --> 00:33:16,466
VARTANN:
Well, that remains
to be seen.

00:33:16,533 --> 00:33:18,469
But the way I see it, you
encouraged a serial killer

00:33:18,536 --> 00:33:20,606
to kill on your blog.

00:33:20,673 --> 00:33:22,675
I did no such thing.

00:33:22,741 --> 00:33:23,876
Did I?

00:33:23,942 --> 00:33:25,679
We'll leave that up
to a jury of your peers.

00:33:25,745 --> 00:33:27,380
I swear to God,
I didn't want to hurt anybody.

00:33:27,447 --> 00:33:29,617
I didn't do anything.
Except shooting
your mouth off.

00:33:29,684 --> 00:33:31,218
Sometimes that's all it takes.
Look, right now,

00:33:31,285 --> 00:33:33,121
you're going to do exactly
what I tell you to.

00:33:33,188 --> 00:33:34,389
Of course.

00:33:34,456 --> 00:33:35,858
What do you
want me to do?

00:33:35,925 --> 00:33:37,226
The killer's been
posting to your blog

00:33:37,293 --> 00:33:38,961
from different IP
addresses around town.

00:33:39,029 --> 00:33:40,431
So, you're gonna
go on this computer,

00:33:40,497 --> 00:33:41,732
get on your blog,
and post

00:33:41,799 --> 00:33:43,802
another reply
to Mr. Anonymous.

00:33:43,868 --> 00:33:45,704
You're going to get
him to respond and
when he does,

00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:46,872
you're going
to keep him talking

00:33:46,939 --> 00:33:49,041
until our people can
run an IP trace route

00:33:49,108 --> 00:33:51,078
and find out where he
is now-- you understand?

00:33:51,144 --> 00:33:52,212
No.

00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:54,215
(sighs):
Just start typing.

00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:55,550
Right.

00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:57,151
What do you want me to say?

00:33:57,218 --> 00:33:58,921
Just tell him
he's a genius, all right?

00:33:58,988 --> 00:34:00,055
Tell him that, uh,

00:34:00,122 --> 00:34:01,223
Michelangelo's
got nothing on him.

00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:02,425
Whatever, just think
of something.

00:34:02,492 --> 00:34:03,426
Come on.

00:34:03,493 --> 00:34:05,028
Come on!
Right.

00:34:07,064 --> 00:34:10,202
(whispering)

00:34:10,268 --> 00:34:11,770
I'll be right back.
Keep typing.

00:34:19,747 --> 00:34:20,682
Ma'am?
(gasps)

00:34:20,749 --> 00:34:21,783
My boy, my Charlie.
Okay...

00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:22,951
He's only nine years old.

00:34:23,018 --> 00:34:24,453
He didn't come home
from school today.

00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,922
We had a fight this morning
and I thought that he was

00:34:26,989 --> 00:34:28,625
at his dad's house--
we're divorced--

00:34:28,692 --> 00:34:30,093
and then the school
told me about

00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,529
some kind of alert
that was happening.

00:34:31,596 --> 00:34:33,297
Right. Do you have any idea
where he might be going?

00:34:33,364 --> 00:34:34,699
No, no.
Okay...

00:34:34,766 --> 00:34:36,502
Detective Vartann,
I got him.

00:34:36,568 --> 00:34:37,870
I got him talking.

00:34:37,936 --> 00:34:40,340
(beeping)

00:34:52,055 --> 00:34:54,258
LVPD! Please remain calm.

00:34:54,324 --> 00:34:56,994
I'd like everybody to stay
right where they are.

00:35:12,581 --> 00:35:14,616
Where's the kid?
What kid?

00:35:14,683 --> 00:35:16,353
Get up! Get up.
No...

00:35:16,419 --> 00:35:18,855
Get him out of here.
What-what kid?

00:35:18,922 --> 00:35:19,856
Hey, hey! Hey!

00:35:19,924 --> 00:35:21,225
I didn't
do anything.
Come on!

00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:28,000
VARTANN:
<i>There was tan dust</i>
<i>on the guy's hands</i>

00:35:28,067 --> 00:35:29,836
like the other vics.
Burlap fibers.

00:35:29,902 --> 00:35:31,238
Does it help?

00:35:31,305 --> 00:35:32,639
I don't know.

00:35:32,706 --> 00:35:35,043
Blisterman didn't
put himself in a burlap sack.

00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:38,581
You know, maybe these
fibers are environmental.

00:35:38,647 --> 00:35:40,783
Like they're present
in whatever space

00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:42,018
he's keeping his victims in.

00:35:42,084 --> 00:35:44,287
You know, there's a lot
of converted warehouses

00:35:44,354 --> 00:35:46,457
and industrial properties
near this library.

00:35:46,524 --> 00:35:47,725
If Blisterman
already has the kid,

00:35:47,792 --> 00:35:49,327
he'd probably
stay close to home.

00:35:49,394 --> 00:35:52,264
We've got city plans
for the area around the library.

00:35:52,331 --> 00:35:54,501
Maps, building usage permits...

00:35:54,567 --> 00:35:57,705
Okay, check every structure,
every single one.

00:35:57,772 --> 00:36:00,976
(beeping)

00:36:01,043 --> 00:36:03,378
He's willing to talk,
but only to someone who

00:36:03,445 --> 00:36:04,680
"understands his work."

00:36:04,747 --> 00:36:05,948
I'm ready
to slap him around.

00:36:06,015 --> 00:36:07,817
I figured you could
show some restraint.

00:36:07,884 --> 00:36:09,286
I'll try.
Okay.

00:36:17,296 --> 00:36:18,731
Mr. Blisterman.

00:36:18,798 --> 00:36:24,138
Can you please turn the monitor
so I can see it?

00:36:32,382 --> 00:36:34,719
Could you tighten up
the frame up a little?

00:36:36,721 --> 00:36:38,990
The composition is...

00:36:39,057 --> 00:36:40,926
It's a bit weak.

00:36:45,164 --> 00:36:47,434
Yeah. Thank you.

00:36:47,501 --> 00:36:49,236
Look...

00:36:49,303 --> 00:36:51,406
I'm here
to talk about the child.

00:36:51,473 --> 00:36:53,843
I'm happy to talk.

00:36:53,909 --> 00:36:57,614
I like to talk,
but I want my words

00:36:57,681 --> 00:36:59,649
to be heard
the way I speak them.

00:36:59,716 --> 00:37:03,388
I want the world
to see the words

00:37:03,454 --> 00:37:05,557
coming from my lips,

00:37:05,624 --> 00:37:09,229
so there can be
no misinterpretation.

00:37:09,295 --> 00:37:11,731
Nobody's going to misinterpret
anything you say.

00:37:11,798 --> 00:37:13,934
But if you don't start
cooperating...

00:37:14,001 --> 00:37:18,373
Don't, don't... rush me.

00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,309
I want to talk about
what <i>I</i> want to talk about,

00:37:20,376 --> 00:37:25,282
and I don't <i>want...</i>
to be rushed, please.

00:37:27,819 --> 00:37:30,522
That's the trouble
with modern life,

00:37:30,588 --> 00:37:32,591
it's too much urgency.

00:37:32,658 --> 00:37:35,862
It's too much speed.

00:37:36,897 --> 00:37:39,500
Now I'm sweaty.

00:37:39,567 --> 00:37:41,702
Do you have a handkerchief?

00:37:47,577 --> 00:37:49,580
Thank you.

00:37:52,216 --> 00:37:54,419
(beeping)

00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:10,940
Aesthetics have always
been very important to me.

00:38:12,542 --> 00:38:13,643
Life wouldn't

00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:18,082
be worth living
without beauty.

00:38:18,149 --> 00:38:21,220
It's what makes us human.

00:38:21,286 --> 00:38:23,957
What about the people
you've murdered?

00:38:24,023 --> 00:38:25,658
They were human.

00:38:25,725 --> 00:38:29,363
Yeah, but...

00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:34,771
they were nothing until I made
them extraordinary.

00:38:34,837 --> 00:38:37,507
How about the child?

00:38:37,573 --> 00:38:41,646
Has he become "extraordinary"?

00:38:45,083 --> 00:38:48,921
I have been
alone my entire life.

00:38:48,988 --> 00:38:51,691
I have tried and tried

00:38:51,758 --> 00:38:53,661
to achieve some recognition
for my work,

00:38:53,728 --> 00:38:57,633
and I have been repeatedly
and cruelly ignored.

00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:04,146
And this has made me
feel very... bad...

00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:08,146
about myself.

00:39:08,213 --> 00:39:09,548
Arthur.

00:39:09,614 --> 00:39:11,918
You're going to be

00:39:11,984 --> 00:39:15,222
put to death
if you don't help us.

00:39:15,289 --> 00:39:17,291
I'm not scared of dying.

00:39:19,894 --> 00:39:22,965
I just don't
want to be forgotten.

00:39:33,845 --> 00:39:35,814
I think I found it.

00:39:37,382 --> 00:39:38,952
"487 Franklyn Street."

00:39:39,018 --> 00:39:40,487
It's a warehouse,
formerly deeded

00:39:40,553 --> 00:39:41,922
to a company
that manufactured

00:39:41,989 --> 00:39:45,025
natural fiber bags
and shipping materials-- go.

00:39:45,093 --> 00:39:46,528
I'll call it in.

00:39:49,265 --> 00:39:51,901
I want something
of who I was left behind

00:39:51,968 --> 00:39:55,973
so people will speak my name,

00:39:56,039 --> 00:40:00,546
and know who I was,
after I'm gone.

00:40:00,613 --> 00:40:03,616
Believe me.

00:40:03,682 --> 00:40:05,852
No one will ever forget you.

00:40:08,456 --> 00:40:10,892
You've made it.

00:40:10,958 --> 00:40:12,728
You're a legend.

00:40:16,766 --> 00:40:18,702
If I tell you
where the boy is,

00:40:18,769 --> 00:40:20,704
you're going to turn
the camera off,

00:40:20,771 --> 00:40:22,707
and then...

00:40:22,774 --> 00:40:25,710
I'll be sad.

00:40:25,777 --> 00:40:27,780
I won't turn the camera off.

00:40:29,816 --> 00:40:31,819
I'm sorry.

00:40:33,888 --> 00:40:35,890
Without the boy,
the piece is incomplete.

00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:39,895
(sirens blaring)

00:40:45,303 --> 00:40:48,674
(tires screeching)

00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:51,610
487...

00:40:51,677 --> 00:40:53,446
Franklyn Street.

00:40:55,415 --> 00:40:58,419
You're far too late
to save him.

00:41:00,455 --> 00:41:02,390
Anyway...

00:41:02,457 --> 00:41:05,461
I got what I wanted.

00:41:07,397 --> 00:41:09,333
You'll remember me.

00:41:09,399 --> 00:41:11,402
Won't you?

00:41:18,377 --> 00:41:20,313
(deep rhythmic pounding
echoing through hallways)

00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:21,715
What the hell
is that?

00:41:21,782 --> 00:41:22,950
Sounds like a motor.

00:41:23,017 --> 00:41:25,019
Take that hall.

00:41:43,676 --> 00:41:47,281
(pounding rhythm
increasing in volume)

00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:56,493
(pounding continues)

00:42:10,845 --> 00:42:12,346
(switch clicks,
air hisses)

00:42:12,413 --> 00:42:14,883
(coughing)

00:42:18,921 --> 00:42:20,690
All right, yeah,
I got him.

00:42:20,756 --> 00:42:22,759
(gasping)

00:42:31,237 --> 00:42:34,975
Patrol, this is
CSI Sanders.

00:42:35,041 --> 00:42:36,599
We need paramedics.

00:42:36,666 --> 00:42:38,735
(gasping)

00:42:39,969 --> 00:42:41,738
Come on.

00:42:41,804 --> 00:42:43,339
Come on.

00:42:44,974 --> 00:42:46,543
(panting)

00:42:46,609 --> 00:42:48,111
Damn it, breathe!
Breathe!

00:42:52,782 --> 00:42:54,717
ADAMS:
Come on.

00:42:54,784 --> 00:42:55,952
Come on.

00:42:56,019 --> 00:42:57,187
Breathe.

00:42:57,253 --> 00:42:58,288
Come on.

00:43:02,892 --> 00:43:05,595
(coughs)

00:43:08,698 --> 00:43:10,433
Hey, it's okay.

00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:14,003
ADAMS:
Shh. It's okay.

00:43:14,070 --> 00:43:16,072
You're all right now.

00:43:21,311 --> 00:43:25,548
ADAMS (quietly):
<i>It's okay. It's okay.</i>
