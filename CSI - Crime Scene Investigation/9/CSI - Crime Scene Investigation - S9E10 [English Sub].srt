00:00:02,274 --> 00:00:04,171
NATE HASKELL:
There's a concrete bridge

00:00:04,171 --> 00:00:07,108
built in 1938.

00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:09,543
25 feet from there...

00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:12,380
look west.

00:00:12,446 --> 00:00:14,682
That's where you'll find Joel.

00:00:14,749 --> 00:00:17,018
BRASS:
His directions to the crime
scene were very precise.

00:00:17,084 --> 00:00:19,020
We found the bones
of a male body

00:00:19,086 --> 00:00:21,122
buried in three feet of dirt.

00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:23,357
ECKLIE:
The hyoid bone was broken,


00:00:23,424 --> 00:00:25,292
which indicates death
by strangulation, so...


00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,029
pending DNA, we're tentatively 
ID'ing him as Joel Steiner,


00:00:28,095 --> 00:00:30,031
the first victim
of Nate Haskell,


00:00:30,097 --> 00:00:31,699
the Dick and Jane killer.


00:00:31,766 --> 00:00:34,168
BRASS:
We found another male D.B.
in close proximity.

00:00:34,235 --> 00:00:38,973
ECKLIE:
We estimate he's been dead
no longer than 24 hours.

00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,875
BRASS:
His name is Jeffrey Masters.

00:00:40,941 --> 00:00:42,510
He was strangled
like the others.

00:00:42,576 --> 00:00:44,845
He has a wife-- Maureen.

00:00:44,912 --> 00:00:47,048
She's not at home,
she's not answering her cell.

00:00:47,114 --> 00:00:48,182
According to friends,

00:00:48,249 --> 00:00:49,517
the two of them were
out clubbing last night.

00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:51,070
We have a broadcast out.

00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:53,506
But you're not 100% certain
she's actually missing.

00:00:53,572 --> 00:00:55,007
How are you so sure
they're victims

00:00:55,074 --> 00:00:56,509
of this Dick and Jane killer?

00:00:56,575 --> 00:00:58,377
Well, Sheriff,
we believe

00:00:58,444 --> 00:01:00,446
the killer is actually
one of his accomplices.

00:01:00,513 --> 00:01:02,114
DJK's signature is

00:01:02,181 --> 00:01:04,984
postmortem stab
wounds to the male.

00:01:05,051 --> 00:01:06,886
They're his version
of notches on a gun.

00:01:06,953 --> 00:01:09,455
ECKLIE:
Jeffrey Masters
was stabbed ten times.

00:01:09,522 --> 00:01:11,457
He and his wife would be the
tenth couple taken overall.

00:01:11,524 --> 00:01:12,959
BRASS:
The M.O. of the killer is,

00:01:13,025 --> 00:01:15,695
he usually targets a couple--
a male and female.

00:01:15,761 --> 00:01:17,797
ECKLIE:
He strangles the male,
then dumps the body;

00:01:17,863 --> 00:01:19,198
BRASS:
Takes the female,

00:01:19,265 --> 00:01:20,399
holds her hostage,

00:01:20,466 --> 00:01:22,301
tortures her; eventually,
he kills her, too.

00:01:22,368 --> 00:01:24,303
How much time do we have?

00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:25,905
ECKLIE:
It's hard to say.

00:01:25,972 --> 00:01:27,340
ECKLIE:
We placed CSI Grissom

00:01:27,406 --> 00:01:29,208
undercover in a college seminar

00:01:29,275 --> 00:01:30,476
in which Haskell
was being interviewed. 

00:01:30,543 --> 00:01:32,244
Haskell implied that he kept

00:01:32,311 --> 00:01:35,147
one of his female vics
alive for three days.

00:01:35,214 --> 00:01:36,148
The general rule of thumb is,

00:01:36,215 --> 00:01:37,550
we probably have
less than 48 hours.

00:01:37,617 --> 00:01:41,554
This is quite the PR
crapper you've dumped me in.

00:01:41,621 --> 00:01:44,257
LVPD and the Crime Lab run
some kind of a sting operation

00:01:44,323 --> 00:01:46,759
in a class
about serial killers,

00:01:46,826 --> 00:01:48,594
and the serial killer uses it

00:01:48,661 --> 00:01:50,896
to reach out from behind bars
and kill again?

00:01:50,963 --> 00:01:53,165
Want to know how you
can make it up to me?

00:01:53,232 --> 00:01:55,134
Find the girl.

A new body at the site
of his first kill


00:02:28,558 --> 00:02:29,826
can't be a coincidence.


00:02:29,893 --> 00:02:30,994
I think that Nathan Haskell


00:02:31,061 --> 00:02:32,396
somehow got a message
to someone.


00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:35,006
No, I agree-- I spoke
to the warden at Ely.


00:02:35,073 --> 00:02:36,508
The only communication
Haskell's had


00:02:36,575 --> 00:02:38,410
with the outside world
in the last 48 hours


00:02:38,476 --> 00:02:40,111
was the phone call
to Langston,


00:02:40,178 --> 00:02:41,913
and that seminar
you were in.


00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,850
Also, Sheriff Burdick wants to
start a task force about this,


00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:47,185
and he's asked me to
ask you to stay on--


00:02:47,252 --> 00:02:48,620
so I'm asking.


00:02:48,687 --> 00:02:50,589
Okay, I have an answer.


00:02:50,655 --> 00:02:52,290
I'll keep you informed.


00:02:52,357 --> 00:02:54,860
LANGSTON:
Tell us your definition of fun.


00:02:54,926 --> 00:02:58,396
Fun is taking something
away from somebody.


00:03:00,332 --> 00:03:03,735
Oh, you never forget your first.


00:03:03,802 --> 00:03:05,737
(woman groans quietly)


00:03:13,512 --> 00:03:15,547
(groans louder)


00:03:15,614 --> 00:03:18,884
(TV playing in distance)


00:03:34,566 --> 00:03:36,334
(exhales gently)


00:03:44,009 --> 00:03:47,579
GAME SHOW HOST: Welcome back
to Question the Answer!


00:03:47,646 --> 00:03:49,781
Dana's our current leader
and has control.
(door squeaks open)


00:03:49,848 --> 00:03:52,117
Okay, it looks like
you've been the jumper today,


00:03:52,184 --> 00:03:53,819
jumping all over the board.


00:03:53,885 --> 00:03:55,253
What's your category, Dana?


00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,521
DANA:
How about "Happiness" for $800.


00:03:56,588 --> 00:03:59,257
HOST:
And "Happiness" for $800 it is.


00:03:59,324 --> 00:04:02,194
Okay, Dana:
"In the central nervous system,


00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:05,163
"this plays an important role


00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:07,933
in modulation of happiness."


00:04:07,999 --> 00:04:10,902
Can you...
Question the Answer?


00:04:10,969 --> 00:04:12,737
DANA:
What is the thalamus?


00:04:12,804 --> 00:04:14,873
THE KILLER (with TV host):
I'm sorry, that's wrong.


00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,908
Serotonin is a chemical
that produces


00:04:16,975 --> 00:04:19,110
happiness in a person.


00:04:19,177 --> 00:04:20,712
HOST:
When serotonin is released,


00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:21,780
happiness is the result.


00:04:21,847 --> 00:04:22,814
Yes, it is.


00:04:22,881 --> 00:04:25,150
(grunting, gasping)


00:04:27,719 --> 00:04:29,588
ECKLIE:
Yes, sir.


00:04:29,654 --> 00:04:31,556
Absolutely.


00:04:31,623 --> 00:04:34,426
Okay. (chuckles)
I will.


00:04:35,494 --> 00:04:36,495
Okay.


00:04:37,729 --> 00:04:39,464
Come in.


00:04:39,531 --> 00:04:40,832
I need a favor.


00:04:40,899 --> 00:04:42,467
It's something
you're going to


00:04:42,534 --> 00:04:43,802
have to clear with the sheriff.


00:04:45,837 --> 00:04:47,405
What, do you have bugs
in my office?


00:04:47,472 --> 00:04:49,875
No.


00:04:49,941 --> 00:04:52,143
I have bugs in my office.


00:04:53,178 --> 00:04:54,746
What?


00:04:54,813 --> 00:04:56,848
What are we talking about?


00:04:56,915 --> 00:04:59,951
Sheriff Burdick is
reorganizing the department.


00:05:00,018 --> 00:05:01,853
From now on, the crime lab


00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,989
will report
directly to him.


00:05:04,055 --> 00:05:06,791
He just made me
the new undersheriff.


00:05:07,826 --> 00:05:09,661
Congratulations, Conrad.


00:05:11,196 --> 00:05:13,064
And I have a great idea for
your first official act.


00:05:14,733 --> 00:05:17,169
Dr. Langston, I was just
going to call you.


00:05:17,235 --> 00:05:18,937
Oh.


00:05:20,205 --> 00:05:21,973
I'll, uh, save you
the trouble.


00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,176
Come on in.


00:05:30,615 --> 00:05:33,485
Huh.
What's on your mind?


00:05:33,552 --> 00:05:36,388
When I was doing my background
research on Haskell,


00:05:36,454 --> 00:05:37,989
I found something
very interesting.


00:05:38,056 --> 00:05:39,624
Now, as you pointed
out in class,


00:05:39,691 --> 00:05:41,693
he's five-ten, 160 pounds.


00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,629
Most of his male victims
were over 200 pounds.


00:05:44,696 --> 00:05:46,498
One was a football player,


00:05:46,565 --> 00:05:47,999
uh, one was a Black Belt,


00:05:48,066 --> 00:05:49,634
but none of them
had defensive wounds


00:05:49,701 --> 00:05:50,869
and none of them were bound.


00:05:50,936 --> 00:05:52,304
Now, most people respond
to being strangled


00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:54,105
by fighting back.


00:05:54,172 --> 00:05:55,874
Unless they're
already unconscious.


00:05:55,941 --> 00:05:57,108
Exactly.


00:05:57,175 --> 00:05:59,311
My feeling is that DJK
subdued them first,


00:05:59,377 --> 00:06:01,546
and I doubt it was using
some kind of stranglehold,


00:06:01,613 --> 00:06:02,948
that would've left bruises.


00:06:03,014 --> 00:06:06,084
Well, all the male vics
had THC in their system.


00:06:06,151 --> 00:06:07,886
But even the most potent
cannabis would not


00:06:07,953 --> 00:06:10,489
completely incapacitate
an able-bodied man.


00:06:10,555 --> 00:06:13,859
So, maybe DJK was
using something stronger.


00:06:13,925 --> 00:06:17,696
Something mixed in
with the dope.


00:06:17,762 --> 00:06:20,932
GHB, diphenhydramine,


00:06:20,999 --> 00:06:22,601
salvinorin A, fentanyl...?


00:06:22,667 --> 00:06:24,636
Any of these in
the proper dosage


00:06:24,703 --> 00:06:26,771
would render a subject
incapable of fighting back.


00:06:26,838 --> 00:06:29,241
I thought if you could ID
it, it might be helpful.


00:06:29,307 --> 00:06:31,576
I realize that this might
be a long shot, but I...


00:06:31,643 --> 00:06:32,744
No, no, no.


00:06:32,811 --> 00:06:34,513
We'll try.
I'll take this to Tox.


00:06:34,579 --> 00:06:36,781
Okay.


00:06:37,816 --> 00:06:40,318
Dr. Grissom...


00:06:40,385 --> 00:06:42,254
I don't like feeling like
an accomplice to murder.


00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,589
You told me you'd keep me
in the loop on this.


00:06:44,656 --> 00:06:46,124
I intend to hold
you to that.


00:06:46,191 --> 00:06:47,759
You don't have to.


00:06:47,826 --> 00:06:50,862
I've arranged with the lab
to retain your services


00:06:50,929 --> 00:06:51,997
as a special consultant.


00:06:52,063 --> 00:06:53,999
I mean, we need all the
good brains we can find.


00:06:54,065 --> 00:06:55,200
What do you think?


00:06:55,267 --> 00:06:57,369
Oh, I'm in.


00:06:57,435 --> 00:06:58,770
I have a theory of my own.


00:06:58,837 --> 00:07:00,172
Tell me.


00:07:00,238 --> 00:07:02,174
I think that
Haskell's accomplice


00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,075
was someone
from your class.


00:07:07,512 --> 00:07:09,948
Whose idea was it
to talk to Haskell?


00:07:10,015 --> 00:07:12,918
Uh, one of my students
from last semester...


00:07:12,984 --> 00:07:14,753
Dan Forester.


00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:18,156
BRASS: Okay, so how
does a clean-cut,


00:07:18,223 --> 00:07:20,625
good-natured PhD student
like yourself


00:07:20,692 --> 00:07:22,994
end up writing letters
to a serial killer in jail?


00:07:23,061 --> 00:07:25,497
Well, maximum security felons


00:07:25,564 --> 00:07:27,432
aren't allowed
unsolicited phone calls.


00:07:27,499 --> 00:07:29,301
You look like a smart kid.


00:07:29,367 --> 00:07:30,635
Don't be a smart-ass.


00:07:30,702 --> 00:07:34,139
Well, I was tired of
secondary sources.


00:07:34,206 --> 00:07:36,274
I mean, there's only
so much you can learn


00:07:36,341 --> 00:07:38,009
about the emotional
dynamics of psychopaths


00:07:38,076 --> 00:07:40,579
from books
and psychologists,


00:07:40,645 --> 00:07:43,515
retired police officers
reliving their past glories.


00:07:43,582 --> 00:07:45,450
I wanted first-hand
material,

00:07:45,517 --> 00:07:48,320
(over speaker): and that's what
I told Professor Langston.

00:07:48,386 --> 00:07:49,754
He thought it was
an outstanding idea.

00:07:49,821 --> 00:07:51,423
Is that true?

00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:52,924
Unfortunately, yes.

00:07:52,991 --> 00:07:54,359
BRASS:
Why did you pick Haskell?

00:07:54,426 --> 00:07:56,461
Well, he was the only
one with a response.

00:07:56,528 --> 00:07:58,964
We sent letters to
about half a dozen.
Hmm.

00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:00,599
You recognize these people?

00:08:00,665 --> 00:08:02,701
FORESTER:
Uh, no.

00:08:02,767 --> 00:08:04,769
How about these people?

00:08:06,304 --> 00:08:08,306
No.
No?

00:08:08,373 --> 00:08:11,009
Okay, how about now?
Uh...

00:08:11,076 --> 00:08:13,111
Nate Haskell somehow
managed to kill

00:08:13,178 --> 00:08:16,715
at least three people
from inside his cell.

00:08:16,781 --> 00:08:18,850
That means he has
an accomplice on the outside.

00:08:19,851 --> 00:08:21,319
Me?

00:08:21,386 --> 00:08:22,354
You can't
possibly believe

00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,289
that I had anything
to do with this.

00:08:24,356 --> 00:08:25,824
I'm not a suspect, am I?

00:08:25,891 --> 00:08:27,993
BRASS:
Well, it was your
"outstanding idea."

00:08:28,059 --> 00:08:30,762
Well, I may have
misrepresented that slightly.

00:08:30,829 --> 00:08:31,997
Now, I don't know
whose idea

00:08:32,063 --> 00:08:34,065
it was first,
but we were all having coffee

00:08:34,132 --> 00:08:35,200
after class last term,

00:08:35,267 --> 00:08:36,968
and several of us
drafted that letter.

00:08:37,035 --> 00:08:39,404
I suppose, yeah,
I may have been the one

00:08:39,471 --> 00:08:41,072
that personally took it
to Professor Langston,

00:08:41,139 --> 00:08:42,974
but he redrafted it
and sent it to Haskell.

00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:44,676
Who were the other students?
I need their names.

00:08:44,743 --> 00:08:45,977
I don't know.

00:08:46,044 --> 00:08:47,078
You don't know.

00:08:47,145 --> 00:08:48,213
Sincerely,
I don't remember.

00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,714
I...

00:08:51,183 --> 00:08:53,018
Are these people really dead?

00:08:53,084 --> 00:08:55,187
Courtesy of your pen pal.

00:08:55,253 --> 00:08:57,255
So, what do we do next?

00:08:57,322 --> 00:09:00,725
Do we interview everyone
that was in the class?

00:09:00,792 --> 00:09:02,260
Well, even if we
can find them all,

00:09:02,327 --> 00:09:03,662
there must be 50 students.

00:09:03,728 --> 00:09:05,931
I don't think Maureen Masters
has that kind of time.

00:09:05,997 --> 00:09:08,333
GRISSOM:
We have to figure out

00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,069
who Haskell
was communicating with.

00:09:12,103 --> 00:09:15,907
Maybe we can see
for ourselves.

00:09:15,974 --> 00:09:18,610
GRISSOM:
Ever had the feeling
you were being watched?

00:09:21,246 --> 00:09:23,582
Even in a crowded room, someone
making eye contact with you,

00:09:23,648 --> 00:09:26,618
just for a second,
triggers a powerful response.

00:09:26,685 --> 00:09:29,387
It's the brain filtering through
a mass of visual information,

00:09:29,454 --> 00:09:31,089
telling you what's important.

00:09:31,156 --> 00:09:32,424
WILLOWS:
Yeah...

00:09:32,491 --> 00:09:34,593
like which predator
wants to eat you.

00:09:34,659 --> 00:09:36,995
If Haskell was communicating
with someone in this class,

00:09:37,062 --> 00:09:38,797
I'm betting that they made

00:09:38,864 --> 00:09:40,298
eye contact
with each other.

00:09:40,365 --> 00:09:41,733
More than once.

00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,969
Are we going to try to match
eye lines with the students?

00:09:44,035 --> 00:09:45,604
LANGSTON:
The University wouldn't allow

00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,671
the students' side
to be recorded

00:09:46,738 --> 00:09:48,707
for liability
and security reasons.

00:09:48,773 --> 00:09:50,709
Okay-- there.

00:09:50,775 --> 00:09:52,577
We thought he said
this to Mrs. Steiner.

00:09:52,644 --> 00:09:54,813
He's clearly talking
to his accomplice.

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,049
Joel was the first.

00:09:58,116 --> 00:09:59,150
Joel lives in the perfect place,

00:09:59,217 --> 00:10:02,287
the place where it all began.

00:10:02,354 --> 00:10:04,089
If I could get
out of here, believe me,

00:10:04,156 --> 00:10:05,423
I would bring him some company.

00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:07,125
Pretty clear now what
Haskell meant by that.

00:10:07,192 --> 00:10:08,527
I'll loop it.

00:10:09,861 --> 00:10:10,962
Joel was the first.

00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:12,664
Joel lives in the perfect place,

00:10:12,731 --> 00:10:14,266
the place where it all began.

00:10:14,332 --> 00:10:16,268
And if I could get out of here,

00:10:16,334 --> 00:10:18,703
believe me,
I would bring him some company.

00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:20,505
If I could get out of here,
believe me,

00:10:20,572 --> 00:10:22,807
I would bring him
some company.

00:10:24,609 --> 00:10:26,077
GRISSOM:
Mrs. Steiner was
standing right there.

00:10:26,144 --> 00:10:29,714
It's hard to tell
who he's really talking to.

00:10:30,715 --> 00:10:33,351
SANDERS:
Anything else he say stand out?

00:10:33,418 --> 00:10:36,488
Yes, um...

00:10:36,555 --> 00:10:37,823
Try two-and-half minutes in.

00:10:37,889 --> 00:10:40,659
Someone asked
how he selected his victims.

00:10:42,327 --> 00:10:43,995
Did you ever buy a car?

00:10:44,062 --> 00:10:45,564
You go down to the showroom,

00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:47,032
you're pretty sure
you're going to get one,

00:10:47,098 --> 00:10:49,634
but why the red one,
why not the blue one?

00:10:49,701 --> 00:10:52,604
Nobody knows, but just one
of them speaks to you,

00:10:52,671 --> 00:10:56,441
and... that's the one
you gotta have.

00:10:56,508 --> 00:11:00,011
Nobody knows, but just one
of them speaks to you,

00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:02,314
and.... that's the one
you gotta have.

00:11:03,849 --> 00:11:05,884
He's looking right here.

00:11:07,419 --> 00:11:08,820
Dan Forester.

00:11:08,887 --> 00:11:10,622
Brass already interviewed him.

00:11:10,689 --> 00:11:13,458
We don't think
he's our guy.

00:11:13,525 --> 00:11:16,294
You know, if you're already
a serial killer's accomplice,

00:11:16,361 --> 00:11:18,763
why take a class
about serial killing?

00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:20,131
SANDERS:
Maybe because he screwed up

00:11:20,198 --> 00:11:22,467
with Ian and Justine.

00:11:22,534 --> 00:11:23,802
Big time.

00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:27,105
SANDERS:
Did anyone ask Haskell

00:11:27,172 --> 00:11:29,474
for any pointers?

00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:31,910
Um...

00:11:31,977 --> 00:11:36,214
Try four hours, 23 minutes in.

00:11:36,281 --> 00:11:38,149
Someone asked him
how he was able to manage

00:11:38,216 --> 00:11:40,051
to control his victims.

00:11:43,255 --> 00:11:44,856
You have to give them hope.

00:11:44,923 --> 00:11:47,259
If you bring a human being

00:11:47,325 --> 00:11:50,695
to the brink of death,

00:11:50,762 --> 00:11:53,465
and then you offer a chance--

00:11:53,532 --> 00:11:56,768
no matter how small a chance--
to survive...

00:11:56,835 --> 00:11:59,905
they'll grab it.

00:11:59,971 --> 00:12:02,607
And they'll thank you for it.

00:12:02,674 --> 00:12:06,011
And then you can do
whatever you want.

00:12:06,077 --> 00:12:08,880
And believe me...

00:12:08,947 --> 00:12:11,149
I did.

00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:14,920
Thomas Donover.

00:12:16,121 --> 00:12:17,856
Let's see if we can find Thomas.

00:12:33,904 --> 00:12:35,172
(knocking loudly)

00:12:38,413 --> 00:12:40,648
Hallie Donover?
Yes.

00:12:40,715 --> 00:12:42,050
Where's your husband?
He ain't in there.

00:12:42,116 --> 00:12:43,418
He-He... He's gone...
He's gone camping.

00:12:43,484 --> 00:12:44,419
Where?

00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:45,658
Um, Mount Charleston.

00:12:45,725 --> 00:12:47,426
He goes to Red Rock Canyon,

00:12:47,493 --> 00:12:48,961
different places, I don't know.

00:12:49,028 --> 00:12:50,229
OFFICER:
All clear.

00:12:50,296 --> 00:12:51,664
What's going on?

00:12:51,731 --> 00:12:52,832
BRASS:
Where's your husband work?

00:12:52,899 --> 00:12:54,233
Right now, kind
of nowhere.

00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,434
Hm.

00:12:55,501 --> 00:12:56,802
No, sir, but he's
in construction.

00:12:56,869 --> 00:12:58,571
You know, these day's
the city's pretty dead.

00:12:58,638 --> 00:13:00,506
But he's going back to school.

00:13:00,573 --> 00:13:02,708
Yeah, we know that.

00:13:02,775 --> 00:13:04,977
So you have absolutely no idea
where your husband is?

00:13:05,044 --> 00:13:06,412
No, sir. No.

00:13:06,479 --> 00:13:07,947
Tom goes camping a lot,

00:13:08,014 --> 00:13:09,849
and he doesn't always tell me
where he's going.

00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:11,550
I don't ask, so...

00:13:11,617 --> 00:13:15,051
You always keep tabs
on your wife?

00:13:15,051 --> 00:13:16,653
Yeah.
That's why I'm divorced.

00:13:19,289 --> 00:13:20,490
Everybody take a room.

00:13:20,557 --> 00:13:22,225
We're looking for anything
that tells us

00:13:22,292 --> 00:13:24,027
where Tom Donover could be.

00:13:26,529 --> 00:13:28,464
(camera shutter clicking)

00:13:40,643 --> 00:13:42,979
Shoe tread's a match
to Tolliver's house

00:13:43,046 --> 00:13:44,214
and Justine in the desert.

00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,549
This is definitely our guy.

00:13:46,616 --> 00:13:48,818
His browser history is clean.

00:13:48,885 --> 00:13:51,020
The laptop is filled
with encrypted files.

00:13:51,087 --> 00:13:52,755
I'm going to get it
back to the lab.

00:13:52,822 --> 00:13:55,258
But this guy knows
how to cover his tracks.

00:14:03,132 --> 00:14:05,268
BRASS:
Do you have
your cell phone on you?

00:14:05,335 --> 00:14:07,604
Why?
Let's get it on;
let's call your husband up.

00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:09,205
We need to
talk to him.

00:14:17,614 --> 00:14:19,682
Yeah, you're welcome
to try it, if you like.

00:14:19,749 --> 00:14:22,452
Tom turns his cell phone off
when he's camping.

00:14:22,518 --> 00:14:25,288
He likes his alone time, so...

00:14:25,355 --> 00:14:27,891
HASKELL:
You have to give them hope.

00:14:27,957 --> 00:14:30,994
If you bring a human being
to the brink of death,

00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:34,531
and then you offer a chance--
no matter how small a chance--

00:14:34,597 --> 00:14:36,599
to survive, they'll grab it.

00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:39,836
And they'll thank you for it.

00:14:39,903 --> 00:14:42,138
And then you can do
whatever you want.

00:14:46,109 --> 00:14:47,210
Please.

00:14:49,245 --> 00:14:51,314
Just don't kill me.

00:15:02,825 --> 00:15:05,728
I'm going to give you
a little rest.

00:15:07,597 --> 00:15:08,731
No, don't!

00:15:15,004 --> 00:15:16,239
You can relax.

00:15:16,306 --> 00:15:17,640
You act like I'm going

00:15:17,707 --> 00:15:20,443
to turn you into
the Joker or something.

00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:28,918
(blades scraping)

00:15:39,462 --> 00:15:41,064
No! No!

00:15:44,133 --> 00:15:45,501
The only way
through that door

00:15:45,568 --> 00:15:46,769
is to break it down.

00:15:46,836 --> 00:15:48,404
I've locked us both
in here on purpose.

00:15:48,471 --> 00:15:49,772
There are a few
windows around.

00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,175
You could probably try those,
but that would be dangerous,

00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:55,245
because I would shoot you
in the back of the head.

00:15:59,015 --> 00:16:02,185
Um... uh...

00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:04,754
I'm sorry.

00:16:04,821 --> 00:16:06,656
It won't happen again.

00:16:06,723 --> 00:16:09,759
The only way out
of here alone is dead.

00:16:09,826 --> 00:16:12,128
The only way out of
here alive is with me.

00:16:12,195 --> 00:16:15,532
Now, if you behave,
you do what I say,

00:16:15,598 --> 00:16:18,201
and you make me happy...

00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:21,104
you'll get out
of here just fine.

00:16:22,672 --> 00:16:26,042
I'll make you happy.

00:16:26,109 --> 00:16:28,177
I'll do whatever it takes.

00:16:30,847 --> 00:16:33,216
Good.

00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:34,684
Now, when we do leave,

00:16:34,751 --> 00:16:37,186
I can't be seen with
you looking like this.

00:16:37,253 --> 00:16:39,222
You need to make
yourself presentable.

00:16:46,029 --> 00:16:48,264
Well, this sure
feels familiar.

00:16:48,331 --> 00:16:52,035
You, me, a serial killer...

00:16:52,101 --> 00:16:53,203
Who's he?

00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:54,470
Dr. Ray Langston.

00:16:54,537 --> 00:16:56,306
He's an expert
on the Dick and Jane killer

00:16:56,372 --> 00:16:57,874
and he's a consultant
on the case.

00:16:57,941 --> 00:17:00,710
We usually don't need
a consultant.

00:17:00,777 --> 00:17:02,812
When the team gets

00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:05,949
a case like this,
we go into hyperdrive.

00:17:06,015 --> 00:17:08,551
It's why we get up
in the morning.

00:17:08,618 --> 00:17:10,820
I can't imagine
my life without it.

00:17:10,887 --> 00:17:11,921
And you are?

00:17:11,988 --> 00:17:13,923
David Hodges. Trace.

00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:15,158
Pleasure
to meet you.

00:17:15,225 --> 00:17:17,594
Likewise.

00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,896
So the red flags

00:17:19,963 --> 00:17:21,564
are the original DJK
body dumps?

00:17:21,631 --> 00:17:22,732
LANGSTON:
Correct.

00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,234
The green ones
are Tom Donover's?

00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,268
That's correct.

00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:26,603
What are the white flags?

00:17:26,669 --> 00:17:29,239
The last places the victims
were seen alive.

00:17:29,305 --> 00:17:31,541
They were all abducted
in Arizona, Nevada

00:17:31,608 --> 00:17:33,009
and California.

00:17:33,076 --> 00:17:35,245
But the male bodies
were all found

00:17:35,311 --> 00:17:37,013
here in Nevada.

00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,948
You know, Joel Steiner
was last seen

00:17:39,015 --> 00:17:41,484
at the Desert Rose Arena.

00:17:41,551 --> 00:17:43,419
His body was found
40 miles away

00:17:43,486 --> 00:17:45,688
just off the 215.

00:17:45,755 --> 00:17:47,257
Couple number two

00:17:47,323 --> 00:17:49,459
was last seen
in Bullhead, Arizona.

00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:50,960
And the male body
was found

00:17:51,027 --> 00:17:51,961
just off the 93.

00:17:52,028 --> 00:17:53,062
He dumped the
male bodies

00:17:53,129 --> 00:17:55,565
like... like they were trash,

00:17:55,632 --> 00:17:57,200
like he wasn't really
interested in them.

00:17:57,267 --> 00:17:58,668
GRISSOM:
Maybe he dumped them

00:17:58,735 --> 00:18:00,703
where it was convenient--

00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:02,472
on the road to somewhere else.

00:18:10,179 --> 00:18:12,215
LANGSTON:
Lake Mead?

00:18:12,282 --> 00:18:15,385
The only problem is Lake Mead
has 550 miles of shoreline.

00:18:15,451 --> 00:18:18,755
I can cut that in half.

00:18:20,523 --> 00:18:22,458
Greg found Didymodon nevadensis

00:18:22,525 --> 00:18:24,627
on the bottom
of Tom Donover's sneaker.

00:18:24,694 --> 00:18:29,199
That moss only grows
on the north side of Lake Mead.

00:18:31,201 --> 00:18:32,468
This is what we live for.

00:19:01,264 --> 00:19:03,533
♪ ♪

00:19:09,862 --> 00:19:11,998
Hey, I was
checking the attic.

00:19:12,064 --> 00:19:14,333
A lot of dust-- but a box
was recently disturbed

00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,335
with a bunch of
VHS tapes in it.

00:19:16,402 --> 00:19:19,171
DVD player,
stacks of DVDs.

00:19:20,973 --> 00:19:22,575
No VCR.

00:19:22,641 --> 00:19:24,343
I'm listening.

00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:29,215
Well, Gerald Tolliver had a VCR
at his house, but no tapes.

00:19:29,281 --> 00:19:30,783
And we know he took souvenirs.

00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:34,086
I found concert ticket stubs
from the summer of '97.

00:19:34,153 --> 00:19:36,288
This tape was made
about the same time.

00:19:36,355 --> 00:19:39,458
I want to get this
back to the lab.

00:19:39,525 --> 00:19:41,794
You look exhausted-- why don't
you let me take care of that.

00:19:41,861 --> 00:19:44,463
No, no, no.

00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:46,198
I'm fine.
I'll push through it.

00:19:46,265 --> 00:19:48,501
It's just...

00:19:48,567 --> 00:19:51,804
It feels like Grissom's
last big game, you know.

00:19:55,675 --> 00:19:57,576
I want to win it for him.

00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:02,782
BRASS:
Recognize this guy?

00:20:02,848 --> 00:20:04,016
How about him?

00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:05,418
That's uh...
that's Gerry Tolliver.

00:20:05,484 --> 00:20:07,219
He's an old friend of
Tom's from Reno, I think.

00:20:07,286 --> 00:20:09,188
Right.
Kind of friend always

00:20:09,255 --> 00:20:10,423
putting the arm on you for money

00:20:10,489 --> 00:20:11,524
when you're doing okay,
you know?

00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:13,225
Uh-huh.
He's a sleazy guy.

00:20:13,292 --> 00:20:14,527
No, what he is,
is he's dead.

00:20:14,593 --> 00:20:15,961
He's dead;

00:20:16,028 --> 00:20:17,563
so's that guy--
they're both dead.

00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:18,731
So's this guy

00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:21,801
and this guy...
and all these guys here.

00:20:21,867 --> 00:20:23,803
They're all dead.

00:20:23,869 --> 00:20:25,304
See, your husband's a murderer.

00:20:25,371 --> 00:20:26,772
Where is he?

00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:28,040
Do yourself a favor,

00:20:28,107 --> 00:20:30,710
tell me--
where is he?!

00:20:30,776 --> 00:20:34,180
But he made me promise
not to tell.

00:20:49,395 --> 00:20:51,430
(phone ringing)

00:20:51,497 --> 00:20:52,732
Tox.

00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:54,433
Hey, Henry, it's Catherine.

00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,069
Grissom said that you were
testing tissue samples

00:20:57,136 --> 00:21:00,006
from the DJK victims
for the presence

00:21:00,072 --> 00:21:01,841
of some incapacitating agent?

00:21:01,907 --> 00:21:03,876
Yes. Actually I just finished.

00:21:03,943 --> 00:21:05,911
Dr. Langston was right.

00:21:05,978 --> 00:21:08,080
They all showed
high levels of...

00:21:08,147 --> 00:21:09,115
Salvinia divinorum?

00:21:09,181 --> 00:21:12,051
Usually Grissom does that.

00:21:12,118 --> 00:21:13,953
Are you bucking
for a promotion?

00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,187
Yes or no, Henry.

00:21:15,254 --> 00:21:16,322
Sorry.

00:21:16,389 --> 00:21:17,790
It's an intense hallucinogenic.

00:21:17,857 --> 00:21:20,192
It'll knock you on your ass
for 15 to 30 minutes.

00:21:36,909 --> 00:21:39,178
Mandy, it's Catherine.

00:21:39,245 --> 00:21:41,347
The print I just sent through,
it's priority one.

00:21:41,414 --> 00:21:44,383
We're looking for anyone who
might lead us to Tom Donover.

00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:47,053
If you get a hit,
get it to Brass ASAP.

00:21:52,358 --> 00:21:55,528
OFFICER:
2-0-3-Charlie,
this is 3-David-34

00:21:55,594 --> 00:21:57,229
coming up on a pedestrian
fitting your description.

00:21:57,296 --> 00:21:58,597
3-David-34,
that's him on the left.

00:21:58,664 --> 00:22:00,199
Let's grab him.
Let's grab him.

00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,235
(siren whoops,
tires screech)

00:22:09,265 --> 00:22:11,234
Control, this is 3-David-34

00:22:11,301 --> 00:22:14,185
in foot pursuit of one male
Caucasian, east on Fremont.

00:22:14,185 --> 00:22:16,254
Requesting backup.

00:22:18,256 --> 00:22:19,524
(siren whoops)

00:22:20,899 --> 00:22:22,667
(siren whoops
intermittently)

00:22:35,306 --> 00:22:36,307
(heavy sigh)

00:22:38,609 --> 00:22:40,845
Oh, man.

00:22:48,984 --> 00:22:50,317
ANDREWS:
It appears that the drug dealer

00:22:50,317 --> 00:22:52,615
was pretty heavy
into his own inventory.

00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,528
His tox was positive for THC

00:22:54,595 --> 00:22:56,029
and opiates.

00:22:56,096 --> 00:22:57,698
Fresh red
around the needle marks,

00:22:57,764 --> 00:23:00,200
and they were oozing
when he was brought in.

00:23:00,267 --> 00:23:02,669
This guy shot up
less than 24 hours ago.

00:23:02,736 --> 00:23:03,904
Did you check
his urine?

00:23:03,971 --> 00:23:05,772
Yes. Urine-heroin levels were

00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:07,941
3,000 nanograms
per milliliter.

00:23:08,008 --> 00:23:12,045
The half-life of heroin
in the system is 24 hours.

00:23:12,112 --> 00:23:14,147
So, when Jeffrey
Masters was murdered,

00:23:14,214 --> 00:23:16,049
and Maureen was
kidnapped, he had to have

00:23:16,116 --> 00:23:17,918
at least twice
that amount in him.

00:23:17,985 --> 00:23:19,753
He wouldn't have been able
to stand up,

00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:20,754
let alone help.

00:23:20,821 --> 00:23:22,256
Which makes him
another dead end.

00:23:23,457 --> 00:23:24,658
Guys.

00:23:25,592 --> 00:23:26,393
You gotta see this.

00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:30,664
Oh, my God! That was awesome!

00:23:30,731 --> 00:23:32,733
I cannot believe you got

00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:34,268
those tickets, baby!
MAN: Of course I got them.

00:23:34,334 --> 00:23:35,636
Thank you, thank you,

00:23:35,702 --> 00:23:37,471
for our almost-getting-
married present.

00:23:37,538 --> 00:23:39,806
STOKES: Got this video
from Tom Donover's attic.

00:23:39,873 --> 00:23:42,709
That's Joel Steiner
and his fiancÃ©e Tiffany Cohen.

00:23:42,776 --> 00:23:43,977
DJK's first victims.

00:23:44,044 --> 00:23:46,313
11 years ago.
The night they disappeared.

00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:48,315
STOKES:
Right.

00:23:48,382 --> 00:23:51,018
WILLOWS:
That's Tom Donover...

00:23:51,084 --> 00:23:53,086
and Gerald Tolliver.

00:23:53,153 --> 00:23:57,224
(talking indistinctly
and laughing)

00:23:57,291 --> 00:24:00,260
I think I got something that'll
keep the party going over here.

00:24:00,327 --> 00:24:03,330
And the "something" is probably
a joint laced with Salvia.

00:24:03,397 --> 00:24:05,599
Yeah. Gerald likes souvenirs.

00:24:05,666 --> 00:24:07,434
I'm guessing that Tom
probably grabbed this videotape

00:24:07,501 --> 00:24:08,602
after he killed him.

00:24:08,669 --> 00:24:10,671
Could be why
he killed him.

00:24:10,737 --> 00:24:12,039
Keep watching.

00:24:14,775 --> 00:24:16,977
(woman shuddering
in fear)

00:24:18,245 --> 00:24:19,379
(clattering)

00:24:20,914 --> 00:24:22,282
(woman screaming)

00:24:22,349 --> 00:24:24,918
I'll do whatever you say.

00:24:24,985 --> 00:24:26,486
I know you will.

00:24:26,553 --> 00:24:27,754
WILLOWS:
That's Nate Haskell.

00:24:27,821 --> 00:24:28,755
(woman screams)

00:24:28,822 --> 00:24:30,824
STOKES:
That's all there is.

00:24:30,891 --> 00:24:33,727
We got a better view
of the house?

00:24:33,794 --> 00:24:36,864
We know that Tom
was continuing in DJK's work.

00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:38,198
It would make sense
that he would

00:24:38,265 --> 00:24:39,766
carry it out
in the same place.

00:24:39,833 --> 00:24:41,235
Certain places hold

00:24:41,301 --> 00:24:43,070
a special power
for some people--

00:24:43,136 --> 00:24:45,839
Stonehenge, the pyramids.

00:24:45,906 --> 00:24:49,009
That house could have the same
kind of power for Tom.

00:24:49,076 --> 00:24:50,344
Could be his sacred ground.

00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:52,713
His wife said that
he went camping a lot.

00:24:52,779 --> 00:24:56,583
Bet that's
his favorite spot.
Mm.

00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:58,685
STOKES:
That's as good as it gets.

00:24:58,752 --> 00:25:00,420
We checked
Nate Haskell

00:25:00,487 --> 00:25:02,689
and Tom Donover
for property titles.

00:25:02,756 --> 00:25:05,559
Neither one of them owns
anything in Lake Mead.

00:25:05,626 --> 00:25:07,494
Maybe the house belonged
to one of their relatives.

00:25:07,561 --> 00:25:09,263
Well, that could take you
forever to run that down.

00:25:09,329 --> 00:25:10,397
Have Archie pull
stills of the house.

00:25:10,464 --> 00:25:11,698
Get them to every local

00:25:11,765 --> 00:25:13,400
unit in the area;
have them check

00:25:13,467 --> 00:25:14,735
with real
estate offices;

00:25:14,801 --> 00:25:16,436
see if anybody
can recognize it.

00:25:16,503 --> 00:25:18,272
Recognize what?

00:25:18,338 --> 00:25:20,240
A house with a window in it?

00:25:20,307 --> 00:25:21,842
Maureen Masters is
running out of time,

00:25:21,909 --> 00:25:23,277
and the only person
who can get us

00:25:23,343 --> 00:25:25,913
to where she is
is Nate Haskell.

00:25:25,979 --> 00:25:27,981
This is the most fun
Haskell's had in a decade.

00:25:29,316 --> 00:25:31,051
He's not going to help us.

00:25:31,118 --> 00:25:32,252
It's a waste of time.

00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:34,855
What we're doing now
is a waste of time.

00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:44,731
...'cause when
I took those women,

00:25:44,798 --> 00:25:47,634
they stopped being
somebody's sister

00:25:47,701 --> 00:25:50,971
or daughter or fiancÃ©e.

00:25:51,038 --> 00:25:53,340
They became what
I wanted them to be.

00:25:53,407 --> 00:25:54,608
(blade scrapes)

00:25:58,879 --> 00:26:01,648
I don't want to die.

00:26:01,715 --> 00:26:04,084
It could just be

00:26:04,151 --> 00:26:07,254
our little secret, and I won't
say anything, I promise.

00:26:07,321 --> 00:26:09,990
Don't do this!

00:26:15,229 --> 00:26:18,665
Oh, God... no!

00:26:18,732 --> 00:26:22,669
(gasping, screaming)

00:26:30,878 --> 00:26:32,846
It's a shame to hide that face
behind this hair.

00:26:36,183 --> 00:26:39,219
I don't like it.

00:26:39,286 --> 00:26:42,589
Uh... um...

00:26:42,656 --> 00:26:43,957
What is that?

00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,895
What are you doing?

00:26:47,961 --> 00:26:50,497
I'm going
to finish your haircut.

00:27:06,914 --> 00:27:09,783
Marco...

00:27:12,152 --> 00:27:14,521
Marco...

00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:18,158
You're supposed to say "Polo."

00:27:26,233 --> 00:27:31,505
Strange time to be stargazing,
don't you think?

00:27:31,572 --> 00:27:34,808
Ansel Adams
often forgot

00:27:34,875 --> 00:27:36,176
when he took
his photographs,

00:27:36,243 --> 00:27:37,878
so a bunch of
astronomers tried

00:27:37,945 --> 00:27:40,547
to figure it out
using the image itself.

00:27:40,614 --> 00:27:42,482
By referencing
the moon's position

00:27:42,549 --> 00:27:44,218
in relationship to known

00:27:44,284 --> 00:27:46,820
landmarks and lunar
azimuth tables,

00:27:46,887 --> 00:27:48,488
they were able to determine

00:27:48,555 --> 00:27:51,525
the date and time
the photo was taken.

00:27:51,592 --> 00:27:53,694
I thought we could
reverse the science.

00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,062
We know

00:27:55,128 --> 00:27:56,830
when this was made.

00:27:56,897 --> 00:27:58,498
Maybe the moon
can tell us where.

00:27:58,565 --> 00:28:00,167
Forensic astronomy?

00:28:06,907 --> 00:28:12,079
I will never forget
the things you've taught me.

00:28:14,615 --> 00:28:16,783
You're the best student
I ever had, Nick.

00:28:19,253 --> 00:28:22,222
Let's see
if we can figure this out.

00:28:52,186 --> 00:28:54,188
(wand beeps)

00:28:59,593 --> 00:29:02,229
(lock buzzes)

00:29:03,263 --> 00:29:06,033
(metallic clanging)

00:29:06,099 --> 00:29:08,235
(lock buzzes)

00:29:18,212 --> 00:29:19,613
(lock buzzes in distance)

00:29:21,181 --> 00:29:23,951
(chains rattling,
footsteps approaching)

00:29:30,524 --> 00:29:33,660
Professor Langston,
how good to see you.

00:29:33,727 --> 00:29:35,562
What brings you here?

00:29:36,597 --> 00:29:39,099
I came...

00:29:39,166 --> 00:29:41,802
to gloat.

00:29:48,742 --> 00:29:50,143
Please.

00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:52,212
Come in, Nate.

00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:05,292
We got these from a videotape
of one of your kills.

00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:08,328
It's hard to
believe, isn't it?

00:30:08,395 --> 00:30:09,763
Now, in all fairness,

00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:11,632
you did say that
only dummies take souvenirs,

00:30:11,698 --> 00:30:15,202
and Gerald Tolliver
was a pretty dumb guy.

00:30:15,269 --> 00:30:18,805
Maybe that's why
Tom Donover killed him.

00:30:18,872 --> 00:30:21,241
I've been thinking that
maybe that's the reason

00:30:21,308 --> 00:30:23,477
Tom Donover decided to follow
in your footsteps,

00:30:23,544 --> 00:30:26,113
and carry on with the work.

00:30:27,881 --> 00:30:30,484
Anyway, none of that
really matters now,

00:30:30,551 --> 00:30:31,985
because, as you can see,

00:30:32,052 --> 00:30:35,055
we found your house
in Lake Mead,

00:30:35,122 --> 00:30:36,723
and...

00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:38,692
we have Tom.
and the girl.

00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:39,693
She's alive.

00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,628
Then what do you
need me for?

00:30:41,695 --> 00:30:43,664
Closure.

00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:47,701
You once told me that you'd been
thinking about it a lot.

00:30:47,768 --> 00:30:50,037
Well, I've been
thinking about it, too.

00:30:51,705 --> 00:30:53,607
I need you to tell us

00:30:53,674 --> 00:30:55,676
where the girls' bodies
are buried, Nate.

00:30:55,742 --> 00:30:56,910
Us?

00:30:56,977 --> 00:30:58,845
So you're working
with that cop now?

00:30:58,912 --> 00:31:00,380
We're gonna find
them eventually.

00:31:00,447 --> 00:31:01,448
You know that.

00:31:01,515 --> 00:31:03,050
We'll dig, we'll
dredge the lake,

00:31:03,116 --> 00:31:04,618
we'll tear that
house of yours down

00:31:04,685 --> 00:31:06,119
to the studs,
if we have to.

00:31:06,186 --> 00:31:08,121
Now why don't you
save us the trouble?

00:31:08,188 --> 00:31:10,023
Tell me what I need to know.

00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:12,826
Look, maybe I can get something
out of it for you.

00:31:12,893 --> 00:31:14,361
Like what, you're gonna reduce

00:31:14,428 --> 00:31:17,130
two consecutive life terms
down to one?

00:31:17,197 --> 00:31:19,533
Like, maybe I can
guarantee that this

00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,235
isn't the last
conversation you'll have

00:31:21,301 --> 00:31:23,003
with someone who isn't
shoving your food

00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:24,471
through a hole in the door.

00:31:24,538 --> 00:31:25,806
I promise you, Nate,

00:31:25,873 --> 00:31:27,841
you don't tell me what
I need to know...

00:31:28,976 --> 00:31:31,144
...the only person
who will hear the sound

00:31:31,211 --> 00:31:33,347
of your voice ever again...

00:31:33,413 --> 00:31:35,716
is going to be you.

00:31:42,022 --> 00:31:44,291
You follow the fence
in the backyard.

00:31:44,358 --> 00:31:45,959
To where?

00:31:46,026 --> 00:31:49,062
To where, what?

00:31:49,129 --> 00:31:52,165
There is no fence
in the backyard.

00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,234
You thought

00:31:54,301 --> 00:31:56,537
you could make me slip up

00:31:56,603 --> 00:31:58,872
and give you something you want.

00:31:58,939 --> 00:32:01,475
You thought you could
get inside my head.

00:32:01,542 --> 00:32:02,809
Get him out of here.

00:32:02,876 --> 00:32:06,146
A person has to do
what I've done to understand me.

00:32:06,213 --> 00:32:07,981
You have no idea
what I've started.

00:32:08,048 --> 00:32:10,484
I'm a teacher, too,
and my students are everywhere.

00:32:10,551 --> 00:32:11,785
They're out there,

00:32:11,852 --> 00:32:13,187
and I've cut
them free.

00:32:13,253 --> 00:32:14,221
Get him out of here.

00:32:14,288 --> 00:32:15,522
They're spreading the word.

00:32:15,589 --> 00:32:17,758
By the time you find them,
it'll be too late,

00:32:17,824 --> 00:32:19,560
because it'll be just more blood
on your hands.

00:32:19,626 --> 00:32:21,261
She's already dead.

00:32:21,328 --> 00:32:22,496
Get him out of here!

00:32:22,563 --> 00:32:23,997
(taunting):
She's already dead.

00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:34,546
(clattering)
GRISSOM:
That's it.

00:32:34,613 --> 00:32:37,249
All right,
I can sharpen that up.

00:32:43,188 --> 00:32:46,158
Gris, I just, uh,
want you to know how much

00:32:46,225 --> 00:32:49,528
I appreciate you putting me
out in the field.

00:32:49,595 --> 00:32:52,064
I'm sure there were
times you wish

00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:54,199
I probably didn't.

00:32:54,266 --> 00:32:58,403
Well... you changed my life.

00:33:00,172 --> 00:33:01,206
STOKES:
Hey.

00:33:01,273 --> 00:33:04,009
Got the moonrise tables
for Lake Mead.

00:33:10,282 --> 00:33:12,684
It's not gonna get
much better than this.

00:33:14,286 --> 00:33:16,088
So the moon is waning gibbous.

00:33:16,154 --> 00:33:18,557
On June 15, 1997,

00:33:18,624 --> 00:33:21,760
the moon rose at 7:46 p.m.

00:33:21,827 --> 00:33:24,997
This video was recorded
at 10:41 p.m.

00:33:25,063 --> 00:33:27,900
That's two hours and 55 minutes
after moonrise.

00:33:27,966 --> 00:33:31,103
That puts it about 45 degrees
above the eastern horizon.

00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:33,238
So that view

00:33:33,305 --> 00:33:35,507
is west to east.

00:33:37,976 --> 00:33:40,012
You know, those peaks

00:33:40,078 --> 00:33:42,014
look like they're
roughly the same height.

00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,250
I've got the topo map.

00:33:45,317 --> 00:33:46,618
Look for two peaks

00:33:46,685 --> 00:33:48,020
that are approximately
the same elevation

00:33:48,086 --> 00:33:50,956
with that geographic
relationship.

00:33:51,023 --> 00:33:52,791
(typing)

00:33:52,858 --> 00:33:54,493
Arch Mountain,

00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:57,129
3,335 feet,

00:33:57,196 --> 00:34:00,599
and Hamblin Mountain, 3,310.

00:34:00,666 --> 00:34:02,100
Fits the bill.

00:34:02,167 --> 00:34:04,102
The moss on Tom Donover's shoes

00:34:04,169 --> 00:34:06,972
can only be found
on the north side of the lake.

00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:08,874
So...

00:34:08,941 --> 00:34:12,010
draw a vector from the
center of those two peaks

00:34:12,077 --> 00:34:14,246
to the north shore.

00:34:17,115 --> 00:34:18,584
(typing)

00:34:28,126 --> 00:34:30,128
Black Mesa.

00:34:30,195 --> 00:34:32,564
(crying, whimpering)

00:34:35,234 --> 00:34:38,170
(crying, whimpering)

00:34:40,873 --> 00:34:43,175
(alarm blaring)

00:34:43,242 --> 00:34:44,810
MAUREEN:
If you let me go

00:34:44,877 --> 00:34:47,713
right now, I won't tell
anybody what happened.

00:34:54,753 --> 00:34:55,921
You can't!

00:34:55,988 --> 00:34:57,256
I did everything that you asked!

00:34:57,322 --> 00:34:58,590
Sorry, I lied.
(screams)

00:35:09,588 --> 00:35:11,657
OFFICER:
Move! Move! Move!

00:35:11,723 --> 00:35:12,925
Guns down!
(whimpering)

00:35:15,761 --> 00:35:17,229
Okay. You're okay.

00:35:17,296 --> 00:35:19,097
You're all right,
Maureen. You okay?
OFFICER:
Clear!

00:35:19,164 --> 00:35:20,332
There we go.

00:35:20,686 --> 00:35:22,287
It's okay, it's okay.
(crying)

00:35:22,354 --> 00:35:24,056
It's okay, Maureen.
Okay, look at me.

00:35:24,123 --> 00:35:25,591
(over radio):
This is Sniper One.

00:35:25,657 --> 00:35:27,926
I saw pink mist.
Do you copy?

00:35:27,993 --> 00:35:29,862
This is Brass.
Suspect is down.

00:35:29,928 --> 00:35:31,864
Code four.
(distant sirens wailing)

00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:33,465
Copy that. We're coming in.
All right.

00:35:33,532 --> 00:35:35,267
(quietly):
It's all right.

00:35:35,334 --> 00:35:37,269
(slow, mournful theme plays)

00:35:37,336 --> 00:35:39,338
(insects chirping)

00:35:45,411 --> 00:35:47,413
(indistinct radio transmissions)

00:36:47,078 --> 00:36:49,080
(camera shutter clicks)

00:36:49,933 --> 00:36:51,101
(shutter clicks)

00:36:52,235 --> 00:36:55,038
(shutters clicking)

00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:04,452
(door opens)

00:37:07,806 --> 00:37:08,891
(door closes)

00:37:13,545 --> 00:37:17,015
A penny
for your thoughts?

00:37:17,328 --> 00:37:20,031
He was sitting right there.

00:37:21,499 --> 00:37:24,602
He was looking at me;
I was looking at him.

00:37:24,669 --> 00:37:26,571
All I saw was...

00:37:26,637 --> 00:37:28,473
another student.

00:37:30,341 --> 00:37:33,678
That's all I saw.

00:37:33,744 --> 00:37:37,014
I guess I'm tired
of getting fooled.

00:37:37,081 --> 00:37:38,516
People lie, Professor.

00:37:38,583 --> 00:37:41,118
The only thing we can count on
is the evidence.

00:37:41,185 --> 00:37:44,021
Thank you for letting me help.

00:37:44,088 --> 00:37:46,491
It was something I...

00:37:46,557 --> 00:37:49,160
Well, it was something
I really needed to do.

00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:54,065
Hey.

00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,102
(sighs)

00:37:58,169 --> 00:38:02,106
I don't know if you'd
have any interest...

00:38:02,173 --> 00:38:06,711
but we have a job position
open at our lab.

00:38:07,745 --> 00:38:10,314
You're serious?

00:38:13,584 --> 00:38:16,387
(chuckles): I can't
imagine myself as a cop.

00:38:16,454 --> 00:38:17,889
We're not cops.

00:38:17,955 --> 00:38:19,991
We come from a wide
variety of backgrounds.

00:38:20,057 --> 00:38:22,860
You're a medical doctor;
you're totally qualified.

00:38:22,927 --> 00:38:25,329
It's an entry-level position.

00:38:25,396 --> 00:38:27,031
The hours are terrible,

00:38:27,098 --> 00:38:29,133
the pay's bad...

00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,370
But money's not exactly
the object, is it?

00:38:32,436 --> 00:38:34,972
I think you'd be a great help
to CSI.

00:38:36,474 --> 00:38:39,143
And you might really enjoy it.

00:38:41,045 --> 00:38:42,947
I'll think on it.

00:39:12,844 --> 00:39:14,278
Okay.

00:39:14,345 --> 00:39:16,881
So this is really real.

00:39:18,916 --> 00:39:20,585
Fine.

00:39:20,938 --> 00:39:22,874
Then, as your friend
and colleague,

00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,575
I feel it is my obligation

00:39:24,642 --> 00:39:27,278
to inform you what
a colossal mistake
you're making.

00:39:27,345 --> 00:39:28,446
Hodges...

00:39:28,513 --> 00:39:31,716
Guys like us don't
just get to hang it up.

00:39:31,783 --> 00:39:34,485
This job is who we are.

00:39:34,552 --> 00:39:36,854
We are the thin blue line
between order and chaos.

00:39:36,921 --> 00:39:38,790
You take yourself
out of the equation,

00:39:38,856 --> 00:39:40,124
who knows what's gonna happen?

00:39:40,191 --> 00:39:42,093
That's
the Butterfly Effect.

00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,428
You taught me that.

00:39:43,494 --> 00:39:46,330
The bad guys will win more
if we don't have you.

00:39:47,965 --> 00:39:52,170
Who is Watson
without Sherlock Holmes?

00:39:52,236 --> 00:39:55,606
Watson was a genius
in his own right.

00:39:59,377 --> 00:40:02,180
It's the right time
for me to go.

00:40:05,844 --> 00:40:07,313
Okay.

00:40:13,752 --> 00:40:15,754
