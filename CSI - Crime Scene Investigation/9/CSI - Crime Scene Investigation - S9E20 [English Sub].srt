00:00:02,822 --> 00:00:03,862
It doesn't have to be this way.

00:00:03,862 --> 00:00:05,864
Just listen to reason.

00:00:05,931 --> 00:00:08,066
I have no use for reason...

00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:10,235
puny human!

00:00:10,302 --> 00:00:12,404
The Selbachian ship
is almost within range.

00:00:12,471 --> 00:00:16,274
And this vessel shall be
the instrument of my revenge.

00:00:17,876 --> 00:00:19,878
Turn your weapon systems
over to me now,

00:00:19,945 --> 00:00:22,647
or I will kill one of your crew
every 2.5 Earth minutes,

00:00:22,714 --> 00:00:25,784
beginning with the female.

00:00:26,852 --> 00:00:27,953
Commander?

00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:29,287
It's going to be all right.

00:00:30,522 --> 00:00:31,089
(beeping, whirring)

00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:32,457
(alarms blare)

00:00:32,524 --> 00:00:33,759
(grunting)

00:00:45,871 --> 00:00:47,139
(alarms cease)

00:00:47,205 --> 00:00:50,675
COMPUTER: All stations secure
from general quarters.

00:00:53,211 --> 00:00:54,813
A pleasure working
with you, Yeoman.

00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,214
As always.

00:00:56,281 --> 00:00:59,551
MAN: We're talking about a piece
of television history.

00:00:59,618 --> 00:01:03,922
The actual Spaceforce microprobe
Commander Artemis Bishop used

00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:05,624
to subdue the alien Gorth

00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:07,659
in the season 2 finale
of <i>Astro Quest.</i>

00:01:07,726 --> 00:01:10,295
And it can all be yours
for just $750.

00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:11,463
750?

00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,365
Do I look like an idiot to you?

00:01:14,933 --> 00:01:17,269
(beeping)

00:01:23,241 --> 00:01:25,644
(whirring)

00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:29,981
(speaking alien language)

00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:32,417
That's nice!

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,955
MAN (over P.A.):
Welcome, Whatifitconners.

00:01:37,022 --> 00:01:40,225
A special encore presentation
of <i>Astro Quest: Redux</i>

00:01:40,292 --> 00:01:44,696
will begin in Room 21-B
in just a few minutes.

00:01:44,763 --> 00:01:47,165
(microprobe beeping)

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,749
Nice uniform.

00:02:03,815 --> 00:02:06,084
Wendy?

00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,096
You're Yeoman Malloy.

00:02:18,163 --> 00:02:21,400
You have a microprobe.

00:02:21,466 --> 00:02:23,602
(chuckles)

00:02:23,668 --> 00:02:25,837
I can't believe this.

00:02:25,904 --> 00:02:26,938
You're a Questor?

00:02:27,005 --> 00:02:28,106
I think <i>Astro Quest</i>

00:02:28,173 --> 00:02:30,742
is the greatest science
fiction show of all time.

00:02:30,809 --> 00:02:33,745
I'm a Commander Bishop
fan myself.

00:02:33,812 --> 00:02:34,880
Who isn't?

00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:36,348
Why Malloy?

00:02:36,415 --> 00:02:37,749
I loved her.

00:02:37,816 --> 00:02:40,252
I mean, I know that she was
completely underwritten,

00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:42,754
but she was the only
female biochemist on TV

00:02:42,821 --> 00:02:44,189
and I liked her spunk.

00:02:44,256 --> 00:02:47,292
Do you think that, um,

00:02:47,359 --> 00:02:48,427
I got the collar right?

00:02:48,493 --> 00:02:50,095
'Cause I think on the show

00:02:50,162 --> 00:02:51,997
that it might've been
a little more, um, swoopy.

00:02:52,064 --> 00:02:55,133
You... It looks perfect.

00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,501
Thanks.

00:02:56,568 --> 00:02:58,537
(indistinct announcement
over P.A.)

00:02:58,603 --> 00:03:00,505
Can I see that?

00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,044
(whirring)
Wow...

00:03:06,111 --> 00:03:09,481
(giggling):
That's great.

00:03:09,548 --> 00:03:12,084
<i>Jihw-CHOK chom-CHEM</i>

00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:16,722
<i>jag-eej BRYCE cichoki.</i>

00:03:16,788 --> 00:03:18,056
I don't speak Vellikon.

00:03:18,123 --> 00:03:19,291
What did you say?

00:03:20,792 --> 00:03:22,894
(woman screams)

00:03:22,961 --> 00:03:25,630
(over P.A.): Security to Room
21-B immediately.
Oh, my God, Jon?

00:03:25,697 --> 00:03:28,200
Security, 21-B
immediately...
Jon?!

00:03:28,266 --> 00:03:31,269
We need medical personnel
in 21-B.
Jon?!

00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,638
Medical personnel
in 21-B.
Jon? Jon? Wake up!

00:03:33,705 --> 00:03:36,274
What is the matter with you?
Oh, my God. Speak to me!

00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,310
Jon?

00:03:38,377 --> 00:03:39,678
Jon?
Excuse me. Excuse me.

00:03:39,745 --> 00:03:41,913
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Wake up! Wake up!

00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,182
Please, everyone stay calm
and stay back.

00:03:44,249 --> 00:03:45,317
We're with the Crime Lab.

00:03:45,384 --> 00:03:46,718
Ma'am, don't touch anything.

00:03:46,785 --> 00:03:48,353
Don't...
Jon!

00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,354
Please, come with me.

00:03:49,421 --> 00:03:50,756
Jon.
Come with me.
Come with me.

00:03:50,822 --> 00:03:53,458
(speed-dials)

00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:54,626
Brass.

00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:55,794
Yeah, it's Hodges.

00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:56,928
Who?
From Trace.

00:03:56,995 --> 00:03:58,597
We have a situation
at the Whatifitcon.

00:03:58,663 --> 00:03:59,965
The Whatifit-what?

00:04:00,032 --> 00:04:01,433
How'd you get this number?

00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,535
I cloned Grissom's cell phone
on a work-related matter.

00:04:03,602 --> 00:04:04,703
That's not important now.

00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:05,804
We have a situation.

00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:07,672
It's one of the exhibitors.

00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:09,641
Could you be more specific?

00:04:11,676 --> 00:04:13,879

Jonathan Danson, 36,
from Chowchilla, California.

00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,730
STOKES: 42 bucks and
a couple of credit cards.

00:05:03,796 --> 00:05:06,299
So it probably
wasn't a robbery.

00:05:10,169 --> 00:05:11,404
Bloody nose,
scratches on the face.


00:05:11,471 --> 00:05:13,406
This guy's been
in a fight or something.


00:05:13,473 --> 00:05:14,807
You know, if there
was a struggle


00:05:14,874 --> 00:05:17,944
it'd be really hard to
tell on a set like this.


00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:20,546
Liver temp was
89.7 degrees.


00:05:20,613 --> 00:05:22,648
He probably died between
midnight and 3:00 a.m.


00:05:22,715 --> 00:05:24,450
So, between then and now
there's probably been


00:05:24,517 --> 00:05:26,586
a few thousand people
with access to this booth.


00:05:26,652 --> 00:05:27,920
You're going to need
a lot of tape lifts.


00:05:27,987 --> 00:05:29,155
And swabs.


00:05:29,222 --> 00:05:31,524
(sighing):
Or...


00:05:31,591 --> 00:05:33,726
I could run a vacuum cleaner
over the whole scene,


00:05:33,793 --> 00:05:35,094
get exemplars
from all these folks


00:05:35,161 --> 00:05:37,630
and keep you two knuckleheads
busy for the next few months.


00:05:37,697 --> 00:05:40,400
How'd that be? Hmm?


00:05:40,466 --> 00:05:41,868
Do me a favor:


00:05:41,934 --> 00:05:46,005
beam yourselves back to the lab
and let us do our job, please.


00:05:46,072 --> 00:05:47,673
Okay.


00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,675
Thank you.


00:05:49,742 --> 00:05:51,511
Nice outfit.


00:05:51,577 --> 00:05:52,812
WOMAN:
<i>I just can't believe it.</i>


00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:55,715
I mean, this-this project
was Jonathan's dream.


00:05:55,782 --> 00:05:57,350
We were so close.


00:05:57,417 --> 00:05:58,818
So close to what?


00:05:58,885 --> 00:06:00,386
He spent five years
on this pilot.


00:06:00,453 --> 00:06:02,955
It's a remake of the
original <i>Astro Quest.</i>


00:06:03,022 --> 00:06:04,824
An executive from Paramount
approached us about it--


00:06:04,891 --> 00:06:08,494
turning it into
a full-on series for the CW.


00:06:08,561 --> 00:06:10,697
Oh, yeah, really?
No kidding.


00:06:10,763 --> 00:06:15,201
"Produced by Jonathan Danson
and Melinda Carver."


00:06:15,268 --> 00:06:18,037
So, do you have a financial
interest in the project?


00:06:18,104 --> 00:06:21,007
Well, yeah, I financed it.


00:06:21,074 --> 00:06:22,241
So, what happens to the rights


00:06:22,308 --> 00:06:23,843
with Jonathan
out of the picture?


00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:26,279
They revert to me, I guess.


00:06:26,345 --> 00:06:27,580
What are you getting at?


00:06:27,647 --> 00:06:29,749
Exactly what you think I am.


00:06:35,621 --> 00:06:37,156
HODGES:
A guy in a red shirt


00:06:37,223 --> 00:06:39,525
dies at the beginning
of most <i>Astro Quest</i> episodes.


00:06:39,592 --> 00:06:41,260
I remember.


00:06:41,327 --> 00:06:42,695
Come on in.


00:06:42,762 --> 00:06:44,030
Thanks.


00:06:44,097 --> 00:06:45,865
Take a look.


00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,503
Perimortem bruise
on the neck.


00:06:52,004 --> 00:06:53,873
And a...


00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:57,110
right-angled laceration
at the base of the nostrils.


00:06:57,176 --> 00:07:01,447
The skin appears
to be split, not cut.


00:07:03,282 --> 00:07:05,051
There's metallic trace
in the wound.


00:07:24,604 --> 00:07:28,107
You and Wendy always go
to Whatifitcon together?


00:07:28,174 --> 00:07:30,743
Actually, it was our first.


00:07:47,393 --> 00:07:51,264
(humming)


00:07:53,299 --> 00:07:55,401
<i>Pleasure working</i>
<i>with you, Yeoman.</i>


00:07:55,468 --> 00:07:57,170
As always.


00:07:57,236 --> 00:07:59,539
Tell me something,
Commander.


00:08:04,177 --> 00:08:05,478
Were you scared?


00:08:05,545 --> 00:08:07,547
I wasn't before.


00:08:10,983 --> 00:08:12,685
But I am now.


00:08:12,752 --> 00:08:14,921
But you're my
commanding officer.


00:08:14,987 --> 00:08:17,957
(shudders)
I'm also a man.


00:08:18,024 --> 00:08:19,625
With a man's needs.


00:08:19,692 --> 00:08:22,662
If you only knew how
many nights I lay awake


00:08:22,729 --> 00:08:24,530
dreaming of a moment like this.


00:08:24,597 --> 00:08:27,333
Oh... I can guess.


00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,702
Hodges, you forgot this.


00:08:29,769 --> 00:08:31,804
GCMS, chop-chop.


00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:37,343
(dramatic music plays)


00:08:42,548 --> 00:08:45,618
My name is Jonathan Danson,


00:08:45,685 --> 00:08:48,354
and I'm here to set you free.


00:08:48,421 --> 00:08:52,492
Free from a vision
of an antiseptic future


00:08:52,558 --> 00:08:55,261
filled with...


00:08:55,328 --> 00:09:00,733
with heroes and heroines
who are always steadfast


00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,804
and well-adjusted
and altruistic.


00:09:04,871 --> 00:09:06,105
When was this taken?


00:09:06,172 --> 00:09:08,908
Last night,
special preview event.


00:09:08,975 --> 00:09:11,644
Anything interesting happens
at a sci-fi convention,


00:09:11,711 --> 00:09:14,814
it's online somewhere
about five seconds later.


00:09:14,881 --> 00:09:15,915
DANSON:
Like most of you,


00:09:15,982 --> 00:09:20,053
I grew up with <i>Astro Quest.</i>


00:09:20,119 --> 00:09:22,588
Every Thursday night
my dad would gather the family


00:09:22,655 --> 00:09:25,858
around our TV
to watch the latest episode.


00:09:25,925 --> 00:09:28,428
(laughing):
I loved it.


00:09:28,494 --> 00:09:31,230
But the older I got,


00:09:31,297 --> 00:09:35,835
the more the mythology
began to eat away at my soul.


00:09:35,902 --> 00:09:41,074
I couldn't measure up to the
brave crew of that perfect ship.


00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,176
I wasn't handsome,
courageous, strong.

00:09:43,242 --> 00:09:47,580
I was weak, petty,
self-destructive.

00:09:47,647 --> 00:09:50,683
And I hated myself for it.

00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,653
But then...

00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,054
One night...

00:09:55,121 --> 00:09:58,858
it hit me like a...
like a bolt of lightning.

00:09:58,925 --> 00:10:00,460
I looked around the bar

00:10:00,526 --> 00:10:02,729
at the other
frightened, sad people and I...

00:10:02,795 --> 00:10:06,699
and I said to myself, "Do you
see an Artemis Bishop here?"

00:10:06,766 --> 00:10:08,901
"Do you see one at work?"

00:10:08,968 --> 00:10:10,403
What's this?
He's showing the <i>Redux.</i>

00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,739
Uh, in your apartment building
or on the street?

00:10:12,805 --> 00:10:15,007
People, look around you.

00:10:15,074 --> 00:10:18,311
Do you see an Artemis Bishop
anywhere?

00:10:18,378 --> 00:10:20,313
Of course not.

00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,782
Because he's
a fictional construct.

00:10:22,849 --> 00:10:26,753
A phantom who whispers,
"You are not enough."

00:10:28,521 --> 00:10:33,726
Well, I am here to show you
who we really are.

00:10:33,793 --> 00:10:35,962
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you...

00:10:36,029 --> 00:10:39,966
<i>Astro Quest: Redux.</i>

00:10:42,835 --> 00:10:44,570
(dramatic music plays)

00:10:44,637 --> 00:10:46,239
(static buzzes)

00:10:46,305 --> 00:10:48,141
I swear to God
I'm gonna do her!

00:10:48,207 --> 00:10:50,510
Garth, you know me.
Just stand down.

00:10:50,576 --> 00:10:51,778
I don't know
anything anymore!

00:10:51,844 --> 00:10:53,079
I'm gonna do her.

00:10:53,146 --> 00:10:54,680
I swear I'm
gonna do her!
Commander...

00:10:54,747 --> 00:10:58,117
Okay, Sally, everything's
gonna be all right.

00:10:58,184 --> 00:11:00,953
(three gunshots)

00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:04,457
Nothing's ever gonna
be all right again!

00:11:04,524 --> 00:11:06,526
Do you see that?!

00:11:06,592 --> 00:11:09,462
Now you're gonna
do what I want.

00:11:09,529 --> 00:11:11,531
(sobbing)

00:11:17,036 --> 00:11:19,772
(murmuring)

00:11:28,581 --> 00:11:29,515
You suck.

00:11:29,582 --> 00:11:30,516
You don't have the...

00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:33,286
(crowd clamoring, booing)

00:11:33,352 --> 00:11:34,654
Do you get it?

00:11:37,256 --> 00:11:41,194
MAN: We're not gonna watch
that crap! Get outta here!

00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,862
So let me get this straight.

00:11:42,929 --> 00:11:44,364
Some nerd

00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:48,801
takes a cheesy, '60s sci-fi show
and turns it into something

00:11:48,868 --> 00:11:51,838
a little bit more realistic--
minus the spaceship, of course--

00:11:51,904 --> 00:11:54,474
and the other
nerds get

00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:57,710
pissed off enough that they beat
him up and kill him over it?

00:11:57,777 --> 00:12:02,382
Well... people don't like it
when you mess with their heroes.

00:12:16,029 --> 00:12:18,131
You got something, Riley?

00:12:18,197 --> 00:12:20,666
Hmm...

00:12:20,733 --> 00:12:23,669
No sign of blood.

00:12:23,736 --> 00:12:26,239
I doubt it's
the murder weapon.

00:12:29,108 --> 00:12:30,376
(sighs)

00:12:31,711 --> 00:12:34,247
Are we going to have
to figure out how many Dumpsters

00:12:34,313 --> 00:12:36,916
3,000 people can fill
in three days?

00:12:36,983 --> 00:12:38,985
Boy, I hope not.

00:12:40,486 --> 00:12:43,189
Whoa.

00:12:43,256 --> 00:12:44,390
I got a...

00:12:44,457 --> 00:12:47,593
whole lot of geek love
on the command chair.

00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:50,930
Isn't that nice for them?

00:12:50,997 --> 00:12:53,633
I just found A/V central.

00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,634
DVD player,

00:12:54,701 --> 00:12:56,703
sound gear.

00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:02,575
And the vic's laptop.

00:13:05,378 --> 00:13:07,613
There's a DVD in the player.

00:13:09,315 --> 00:13:13,152
MAN: According to Article 13 of
the Planetary Alliance Charter,

00:13:13,219 --> 00:13:15,822
we find Jonathan Danson guilty
of high treason.

00:13:15,888 --> 00:13:17,323
STOKES: This wasn't part
of the presentation.

00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:20,126
And the penalty is...

00:13:20,193 --> 00:13:21,761
Please!

00:13:21,828 --> 00:13:22,929
No!

00:13:22,995 --> 00:13:24,997
(sobbing):
I'm sorry!

00:13:25,064 --> 00:13:27,467
I won't ever do it again!

00:13:27,533 --> 00:13:31,337
Don't kill me, please!

00:13:34,841 --> 00:13:37,677
I got to start
watching this show.

00:13:37,744 --> 00:13:39,412
MAN:
<i>Sic Semper Tradi torae.</i>

00:13:39,479 --> 00:13:40,546
Death to traitors.

00:13:45,109 --> 00:13:46,210
(knocking)
Yeah?

00:13:46,276 --> 00:13:48,679
Uh, Catherine, um,

00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:50,781
hypothetically,

00:13:50,848 --> 00:13:54,118
if I knew of someone in the lab
having a relationship...

00:13:54,184 --> 00:13:55,219
What kind of a relationship?

00:13:55,285 --> 00:13:58,288
Um... personal.

00:13:58,355 --> 00:13:59,389
Affectionate.

00:13:59,456 --> 00:14:00,390
Romantic?

00:14:00,457 --> 00:14:02,292
Okay.

00:14:02,359 --> 00:14:05,996
Um, hypothetically,
if I knew of someone in the lab

00:14:06,063 --> 00:14:08,599
having a romantic
relationship...

00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:13,637
...would I be obligated
to report them?

00:14:13,704 --> 00:14:14,638
Yes.

00:14:14,705 --> 00:14:16,240
To Ecklie.

00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:21,979
And, hypothetically,
would they suffer consequences?

00:14:22,045 --> 00:14:23,614
Are they hypothetically
on the same shift?

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,915
Yes.

00:14:24,982 --> 00:14:26,617
Supervisor-subordinate?
No.

00:14:26,683 --> 00:14:28,619
Then one of them will
have to change shifts.

00:14:28,685 --> 00:14:31,288
But other than that,
they should be fine.

00:14:31,355 --> 00:14:33,290
Just tell them
to report it to Ecklie

00:14:33,357 --> 00:14:35,626
and to go for it.

00:14:35,692 --> 00:14:37,694
Life's too short, right?

00:14:41,565 --> 00:14:44,501
(mouthing)

00:15:06,056 --> 00:15:07,991
SANDERS:
<i>So what's a college professor</i>

00:15:08,058 --> 00:15:10,994
doing taping the debut
of <i>Astro Quest: Redux</i>

00:15:11,061 --> 00:15:12,996
at a science fiction
convention?

00:15:13,063 --> 00:15:14,598
I was there
with my crew.

00:15:14,665 --> 00:15:17,234
I'm making a documentary
on the gestalt constructs

00:15:17,301 --> 00:15:19,269
of sci-fi mytho-cultures.

00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:20,771
Really?

00:15:20,838 --> 00:15:22,439
Have a seat.
Thank you.

00:15:22,506 --> 00:15:25,476
I wanted to talk to you
about your video.

00:15:25,542 --> 00:15:27,444
The crowd didn't seem

00:15:27,511 --> 00:15:31,048
to like Danson's new take
on their old mythology.

00:15:31,115 --> 00:15:34,051
Danson was a provocateur.

00:15:34,118 --> 00:15:36,854
I actually loved his boldness.
But he was playing with fire.

00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,022
You believe

00:15:39,089 --> 00:15:40,824
one of these people
killed him?

00:15:40,891 --> 00:15:42,292
Would you believe it?

00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:43,327
(crowd clamoring)

00:15:43,393 --> 00:15:44,895
To its fans,

00:15:44,962 --> 00:15:47,898
<i>Astro Quest</i> is more
than just a television show.

00:15:47,965 --> 00:15:49,833
It's a religion.

00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,468
When he screened
his <i>Redux,</i>

00:15:51,535 --> 00:15:53,470
that was the sci-fi equivalent

00:15:53,537 --> 00:15:55,873
of Martin Luther nailing
his "95 Theses"

00:15:55,939 --> 00:15:57,908
to the door of the Castle Church
in Wittenberg.

00:15:57,975 --> 00:16:01,011
That's keeping it
in perspective.

00:16:01,078 --> 00:16:03,013
People kill each other
all the time

00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:06,016
over belief systems,
Mr. Sanders.

00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:08,685
Or perhaps you're not familiar
with the Middle East.

00:16:08,752 --> 00:16:10,854
ROBBINS:
<i>C.O.D. was cerebral hemorrhage</i>

00:16:10,921 --> 00:16:12,489
due to blunt-force trauma.

00:16:12,556 --> 00:16:15,058
Sharp blow to the nasal bone

00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,127
snapped the nasofrontal
suture,

00:16:17,194 --> 00:16:19,163
driving it
into the frontal sinus,

00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:21,598
where a secondary fracture
penetrated the frontal lobe.

00:16:21,665 --> 00:16:23,867
Instant unconsciousness.

00:16:23,934 --> 00:16:25,702
He was dead
within minutes.

00:16:25,769 --> 00:16:27,037
Any idea what hit him?

00:16:27,104 --> 00:16:29,039
Something angular,
silver-colored.

00:16:29,106 --> 00:16:30,741
We haven't found
the murder weapon yet.

00:16:30,808 --> 00:16:33,076
Uh, David, would you finish
stitching him up, please?

00:16:33,143 --> 00:16:34,578
PHILLIPS:
I'm not a seamstress.

00:16:34,645 --> 00:16:36,613
I'm a coroner's
investigator, damn it.
(sighs)

00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,416
He's been doing that all day.

00:16:39,483 --> 00:16:41,418
He's riffing
Corpsman Scully's one-liners

00:16:41,485 --> 00:16:43,020
from <i>Astro Quest.</i>

00:16:43,087 --> 00:16:44,855
Didn't watch it much.

00:16:44,922 --> 00:16:46,523
PHILLIPS: Because you're
not a couch potato.

00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,926
You're a medical
examiner, damn it.

00:16:48,992 --> 00:16:53,530
Well, he was obviously
in some kind of struggle.

00:16:53,597 --> 00:16:55,566
What do you make
of this contusion here?

00:16:55,632 --> 00:16:57,701
ROBBINS:
It's on a pressure point.

00:16:57,768 --> 00:17:00,704
Maybe someone attempted
a sleeper hold.

00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:03,707
You mean like a Sethlan
submission claw?

00:17:03,774 --> 00:17:04,975
That's real?

00:17:05,042 --> 00:17:07,611
ROBBINS:
Well, you tell me.

00:17:07,678 --> 00:17:08,946
(grunting)

00:17:09,012 --> 00:17:10,214
Aah! Okay!

00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,548
Ow! Ow!

00:17:11,615 --> 00:17:13,050
Ow!

00:17:13,117 --> 00:17:15,786
(grunts)

00:17:15,853 --> 00:17:19,189
There was something odd
in the stomach contents.

00:17:19,256 --> 00:17:20,924
Take a whiff.

00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,361
Alcohol.

00:17:24,428 --> 00:17:25,395
CuraÃ§ao, maybe.

00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:26,430
What are these, um,

00:17:26,497 --> 00:17:28,999
vermiform chunks of meat?

00:17:29,066 --> 00:17:31,001
Those are Vellikon skullworms,

00:17:31,068 --> 00:17:33,670
which would of course explain
the Tijillian ale.

00:17:33,737 --> 00:17:35,506
It's <i>Astro Quest</i> food.

00:17:35,572 --> 00:17:36,774
Some of the bars
and restaurants

00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,942
around the convention
do that sort of stuff

00:17:39,009 --> 00:17:40,944
for the conventioneers.

00:17:41,011 --> 00:17:42,946
That hurt.

00:17:43,013 --> 00:17:44,982
Good.

00:17:45,048 --> 00:17:47,351
STOKES:
<i>His name is Jonathan Danson.</i>

00:17:47,418 --> 00:17:48,852
You recognize him?
Yeah.

00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:50,354
Yeah, he was in here
that night.

00:17:50,421 --> 00:17:52,322
And he wasn't
a happy camper.

00:17:52,389 --> 00:17:55,826
<i>He'd been alone at the bar</i>
<i>knocking back drinks</i>

00:17:55,893 --> 00:17:57,361
<i>when this</i> Astro Quest <i>girl</i>
<i>comes up.</i>

00:17:57,428 --> 00:17:59,263
Yeah, another
Vapor, please.

00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:02,533
<i>He started jocking her</i>
<i>pretty hard.</i>

00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:03,634
No, thank you.
No?

00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,269
Could you please
let go of me now?

00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:06,437
Please.

00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:08,172
<i>Her friends didn't like that.</i>

00:18:08,238 --> 00:18:10,240
Sir, you just need to
let go of my commander.

00:18:10,307 --> 00:18:11,475
Everything will be okay.
Sir, please.

00:18:11,542 --> 00:18:12,676
WOMAN:
Let go!
Just let go!

00:18:12,743 --> 00:18:14,478
Hey, stop that!
You have no respect!

00:18:14,545 --> 00:18:16,647
(shouting)

00:18:16,713 --> 00:18:18,482
Get him!

00:18:18,549 --> 00:18:20,150
First off, we abhor violence.

00:18:20,217 --> 00:18:22,886
That's the first thing wrong
with your entire show!

00:18:22,953 --> 00:18:26,056
Yeah, now--
see how it feels?

00:18:26,123 --> 00:18:28,058
I'm not down with violence.

00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:29,927
So I put an end to it.

00:18:30,961 --> 00:18:32,729
Any of those people

00:18:32,796 --> 00:18:35,866
in these photos?

00:18:35,933 --> 00:18:37,234
Yeah, these three right here.

00:18:37,301 --> 00:18:39,036
You didn't happen

00:18:39,103 --> 00:18:41,071
to get any names, did you?
No. Sorry.

00:18:41,138 --> 00:18:42,906
After the fight they all split.

00:18:42,973 --> 00:18:45,709
Well, there's nothing
worse than a bunch of
drunk conventioneers.

00:18:45,776 --> 00:18:47,845
Must be hard enough
to sling drinks

00:18:47,911 --> 00:18:49,913
without making you play
dress-up.

00:18:54,918 --> 00:18:56,887
How do you like this makeup?

00:18:56,954 --> 00:19:00,057
Got it on my second tour
of Afghanistan.

00:19:00,124 --> 00:19:02,392
These Astro Questors,
they believe in a future

00:19:02,459 --> 00:19:05,395
where human beings, they
transcend their differences.

00:19:05,462 --> 00:19:08,999
I wouldn't mind living
in a world like that.

00:19:09,066 --> 00:19:11,702
Yeah, me either.

00:19:11,769 --> 00:19:12,736
(whirring)

00:19:12,803 --> 00:19:14,171
You better be careful.

00:19:14,238 --> 00:19:16,006
That thing gave me
a nasty little shock.

00:19:16,073 --> 00:19:17,841
Well, of course it did.

00:19:17,908 --> 00:19:19,309
This is the...

00:19:19,376 --> 00:19:22,079
Compliance yoke from
"The Slavers of Sirenodon."

00:19:22,146 --> 00:19:23,080
It's a classic.

00:19:23,147 --> 00:19:24,748
I know, right?

00:19:24,815 --> 00:19:26,850
So, the commander and his
crew are basically forced

00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:28,519
into hard labor, right?
By the planet's...

00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:30,287
disembodied rulers.
Disembodied, yeah.

00:19:30,354 --> 00:19:32,790
And they make everybody
wear one of these things

00:19:32,856 --> 00:19:34,858
around their necks.
Yeah, and if they don't
follow orders,

00:19:34,925 --> 00:19:37,394
then they get zapped
with this paralyzing pain.

00:19:37,461 --> 00:19:39,396
Hey! Hodges!

00:19:39,463 --> 00:19:40,731
You don't have gloves on.

00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:41,965
It hasn't been processed.

00:19:42,032 --> 00:19:43,901
Sorry.

00:19:43,967 --> 00:19:45,969
Don't make me use this.

00:19:47,037 --> 00:19:48,939
(machine powering down)

00:19:49,006 --> 00:19:51,442
What, if anything else,

00:19:51,508 --> 00:19:53,243
did you do growing up?

00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,745
Sneer if you wish,

00:19:54,812 --> 00:19:56,580
but science fiction
has been the inspiration

00:19:56,647 --> 00:19:58,982
for many great technological
breakthroughs.

00:19:59,049 --> 00:20:00,818
I'm not knocking it.
I love sci-fi.

00:20:00,884 --> 00:20:02,586
You know, especially
that talking horse show.

00:20:02,653 --> 00:20:04,321
That was one of my favorites.

00:20:05,355 --> 00:20:07,224
<i>Mr. Ed?</i>

00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:08,459
Yeah.
Yeah.

00:20:08,525 --> 00:20:10,060
That's not science fiction.

00:20:10,127 --> 00:20:11,528
Sure, it is.

00:20:11,595 --> 00:20:13,030
It postulates
an alternate universe

00:20:13,097 --> 00:20:15,032
in which horses
evolve a larynx.
No.

00:20:15,099 --> 00:20:16,600
See, that's fantasy.

00:20:16,667 --> 00:20:18,635
No, fantasy is anything
that travels

00:20:18,702 --> 00:20:20,471
faster than the speed
of light, Hodges.

00:20:20,537 --> 00:20:22,339
Which is why if Albert Einstein
were alive today,

00:20:22,406 --> 00:20:24,441
he'd slap your face.

00:20:24,508 --> 00:20:26,343
(whirring)

00:20:34,084 --> 00:20:36,620
HODGES:
<i>I wasn't born to be a slave.</i>

00:20:36,687 --> 00:20:40,591
(dramatic music plays)

00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:42,092
Is this what
we're supposed to do

00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,094
for the rest
of our lives?
Yes.

00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:47,097
The supervisors assign us
the tasks we are to perform.

00:20:47,164 --> 00:20:50,100
Yours is to collect
carbonite rocks.

00:20:50,167 --> 00:20:52,936
Mine is to ensure that you
collect carbonite rocks.

00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:55,005
I'm sick
of picking up rocks!

00:20:56,807 --> 00:20:59,176
Rest if you wish.

00:20:59,243 --> 00:21:01,245
What I wish...

00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:03,547
is to be free.

00:21:03,614 --> 00:21:05,849
On my planet,

00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:08,719
we <i>choose</i> where we go,

00:21:08,786 --> 00:21:11,422
what to do, who to love.

00:21:11,488 --> 00:21:13,424
What is...

00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:14,858
love?

00:21:14,925 --> 00:21:16,760
On my planet,

00:21:16,827 --> 00:21:19,129
love is the single most
important thing

00:21:19,196 --> 00:21:21,165
that can happen
between sentient beings.

00:21:21,231 --> 00:21:23,367
Oh, you mean mating.

00:21:23,434 --> 00:21:25,636
When the time comes
to increase the staff,

00:21:25,702 --> 00:21:28,772
my supervisor will
approve a mate for me.

00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:31,809
Wouldn't you like to
choose your own mate?

00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:34,211
Wouldn't you like that?

00:21:35,612 --> 00:21:38,315
Such talk is not permitted
in the workplace.

00:21:38,382 --> 00:21:40,250
Wouldn't you like...

00:21:40,317 --> 00:21:41,785
just once...

00:21:41,852 --> 00:21:43,787
to choose for yourself?

00:21:43,854 --> 00:21:45,622
(electronic tone warbling,
buzzing)

00:21:45,689 --> 00:21:46,957
(groaning)

00:21:47,024 --> 00:21:49,059
No! No!

00:21:49,126 --> 00:21:51,095
Catherine said
it would be all right.

00:21:51,161 --> 00:21:53,363
That Ecklie wouldn't have
any problem with it.

00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:54,598
WEBSTER:
<i>Hey, Hodges.</i>

00:21:54,665 --> 00:21:55,933
No!

00:21:55,999 --> 00:21:57,334
Hodges!
Yes?

00:21:57,401 --> 00:21:59,636
I got work hits
off both sets

00:21:59,703 --> 00:22:01,171
of those prints
from that DVD,

00:22:01,238 --> 00:22:02,406
and they are locals.

00:22:02,473 --> 00:22:05,008
Well, sort of.
They're from Pahrump.

00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:09,079
(knocking)

00:22:09,146 --> 00:22:10,848
BRASS:
How do you
do, ma'am?

00:22:10,914 --> 00:22:13,517
I'm Detective Jim Brass,
Las Vegas Police.

00:22:13,584 --> 00:22:16,420
We're looking for Lionel Rose
and Steuben Lorenz.

00:22:16,487 --> 00:22:18,288
They're upstairs.

00:22:18,355 --> 00:22:20,224
Where else?

00:22:30,834 --> 00:22:31,969
ELECTRONIC VOICE:
Identification.

00:22:32,035 --> 00:22:33,137
(beep, whirr)

00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,975
Mom, not now.

00:22:38,041 --> 00:22:39,843
I told you
we're debriefing.

00:22:42,346 --> 00:22:43,881
Red alert.

00:22:50,234 --> 00:22:53,371
Yeah, we made it.
It was a joke.

00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:57,742
Of course, humor is subjective.

00:22:57,809 --> 00:22:58,843
So, when
Jonathan Danson

00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:01,712
found you sabotaging
his life's work,

00:23:01,779 --> 00:23:03,948
did he subjectively
kick your ass?

00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:05,149
DANSON:
Hey!

00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:06,684
Hey!

00:23:06,751 --> 00:23:08,186
What the hell
are you guys doing here?

00:23:08,252 --> 00:23:09,954
What...

00:23:11,022 --> 00:23:12,390
(yelps)
Don't touch that!

00:23:17,328 --> 00:23:19,230
No, no, that's not true.

00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:20,765
(sighs)

00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:23,668
He kicked our asses before,
at the bar.

00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:27,672
You see, I adopted
a Gandhi-esque strategy

00:23:27,738 --> 00:23:28,706
of passive resistance

00:23:28,773 --> 00:23:30,007
to force the aggressor

00:23:30,074 --> 00:23:31,943
to recognize the immorality
of his actions,

00:23:32,009 --> 00:23:33,845
while Lionel attempted
to avoid confrontation

00:23:33,911 --> 00:23:35,613
like an inferior male baboon

00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,015
who presents his rump
for the dominant male to mount.

00:23:38,082 --> 00:23:40,384
Unfortunately...

00:23:40,451 --> 00:23:43,488
Danson proved ignorant
of baboon body language.

00:23:43,554 --> 00:23:46,457
We-we didn't even go to
the convention hall that night.

00:23:46,524 --> 00:23:48,793
We sent her: Risa.

00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,261
Risa Parvess.

00:23:50,328 --> 00:23:52,196
P-A-R-V-E-S-S.

00:23:52,263 --> 00:23:54,332
Uh, I didn't think
it was a good idea.

00:23:54,398 --> 00:23:56,134
I mean,
she's always been

00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,301
really unstable.

00:23:57,368 --> 00:23:59,904
STEUBEN:
Did you deliver
the payload?

00:24:00,938 --> 00:24:02,840
Yeah, I guess,

00:24:02,907 --> 00:24:05,276
but there were...

00:24:05,343 --> 00:24:07,411
complications.

00:24:07,478 --> 00:24:09,514
Complications, like what?

00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:11,883
Did someone see you?

00:24:11,949 --> 00:24:13,518
If you did anything
to compromise

00:24:13,584 --> 00:24:14,886
the safety of
this crew...

00:24:14,952 --> 00:24:16,154
There is no crew!

00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,688
This isn't

00:24:17,755 --> 00:24:19,423
a spaceship!

00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:23,194
I'm done playing
your stupid games.

00:24:24,295 --> 00:24:26,397
Where do we find her?

00:24:26,464 --> 00:24:28,433
STEUBEN:
I have no idea.

00:24:28,499 --> 00:24:30,868
She's always been
quite unstable.

00:24:30,935 --> 00:24:32,370
(snickering)

00:24:34,272 --> 00:24:35,873
SIMMS:
Hey.
Hey.

00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,942
I just got the results back
from the command chair,

00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:40,778
and it's the victim,
plus an unknown female,

00:24:40,845 --> 00:24:42,780
so we're closing in.

00:24:42,847 --> 00:24:43,981
Great.

00:24:44,048 --> 00:24:45,116
Hey, also, I was thinking

00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:47,185
that maybe after shift,
it would be kind of fun

00:24:47,251 --> 00:24:48,719
to have a little
<i>Astro Quest</i> mini-marathon.

00:24:48,786 --> 00:24:49,720
Ooh.

00:24:49,787 --> 00:24:50,888
Like maybe
"Yesterday's Tomorrow,"

00:24:50,955 --> 00:24:52,757
parts 1, 2, and 3?

00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:55,393
You mean the time travel
trilogy from season 4?

00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,095
Oh, yes.
It's great.

00:24:57,161 --> 00:24:58,596
Yeah, count me in.

00:24:58,663 --> 00:24:59,897
Good.
Yeah.

00:24:59,964 --> 00:25:01,432
Hey, uh, I'll even
spring for pizza,

00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:03,401
if it's not too much
of a crowd.

00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:06,637
Well, two is not much
of a crowd, really, so...

00:25:06,704 --> 00:25:08,706
You mean just you and me?

00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:10,641
Yeah.

00:25:10,708 --> 00:25:12,376
You, me, the
Blu-Ray DVD box set

00:25:12,443 --> 00:25:15,246
and a brand-new
plasma TV.

00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,415
Over at your place?

00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:18,549
Yeah.

00:25:18,616 --> 00:25:20,651
That's where I keep my TV.

00:25:20,718 --> 00:25:22,487
Okay, sounds good.

00:25:22,553 --> 00:25:24,355
Yeah, it will be.

00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:45,610
Have you ever
actually seen one?

00:25:47,345 --> 00:25:50,648
I mean, have you ever
actually seen one...

00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:52,517
in the flesh?

00:25:52,583 --> 00:25:55,453
A Tijillian concubine.

00:25:58,256 --> 00:26:00,224
JOHNSON:
Feral...

00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:01,793
carnal...

00:26:01,859 --> 00:26:03,661
voracious.

00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,168
JOHNSON:
I'd say she's worth

00:26:10,234 --> 00:26:11,569
a change in shift.

00:26:11,636 --> 00:26:12,737
Wouldn't you?

00:26:24,449 --> 00:26:26,651
(whispering):
You're on fire.

00:26:30,421 --> 00:26:31,989
Hodges, you're on fire.

00:26:32,056 --> 00:26:34,058
(fire crackling)

00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:40,798
What happened?

00:26:40,865 --> 00:26:43,401
I was checking the unknown's
solubility in acetone,

00:26:43,468 --> 00:26:45,036
when I guess it caught on fire.

00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:46,304
My mind wandered.

00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:48,072
That's been happening
a lot lately, Hodges.

00:26:48,139 --> 00:26:49,207
What's going on with you?

00:26:49,273 --> 00:26:51,209
There's nothing going on.

00:26:51,275 --> 00:26:55,012
This is a crime lab,
not some Tijillian casbah.

00:26:55,079 --> 00:26:56,714
Excuse me?
You, me,
a DVD...

00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:59,350
I don't think it's going
to help us catch a killer.

00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:02,053
Are you actually trying
to blame all this on me?

00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,287
Not in so many words.

00:27:03,354 --> 00:27:04,789
Okay, you know what?

00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:06,324
I asked you
to come over

00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:08,292
and watch a DVD--
that's it--

00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:10,495
so if you're having
some fantasies about me

00:27:10,561 --> 00:27:12,130
dressed up
in a tinfoil bikini,

00:27:12,196 --> 00:27:13,598
dancing around in a casbah

00:27:13,664 --> 00:27:15,733
on a strange alien planet,
then... good.

00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,635
Good?

00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:20,071
Yes, good, 'cause it means
you're not as oblivious

00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:21,572
as everyone around here
seems to think you are.

00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:22,840
But the fact is,

00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:24,709
if you can't handle
the way...

00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:28,379
if you can't handle the way that
those fantasies makes you feel,

00:27:28,446 --> 00:27:30,181
don't turn all that around
and blame me

00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:31,849
when you screw up.
Don't worry
about it.

00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:33,317
It's not gonna happen again.
Well, that's

00:27:33,384 --> 00:27:35,219
not the only thing
that's not gonna happen.
Fine.

00:27:35,286 --> 00:27:37,588
Fine.

00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:49,133
Yeah, she, uh, wandered
into the bar a couple hours ago.

00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,369
Totally strung out.
Okay.

00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:54,539
Put a little caffeine in her,
a little conversation,

00:27:54,605 --> 00:27:57,074
and she was willing to come in
and do the right thing.

00:27:57,141 --> 00:27:58,843
Okay... thanks.

00:27:58,910 --> 00:27:59,944
No problem.

00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,179
Hey, you know, um...

00:28:01,245 --> 00:28:03,714
they were giving these away
at the convention.

00:28:03,781 --> 00:28:04,982
You should check it out.

00:28:05,049 --> 00:28:06,717
You might like it.

00:28:07,718 --> 00:28:09,454
Thanks.

00:28:16,227 --> 00:28:18,463
Miss Parvess?

00:28:18,529 --> 00:28:20,131
My name is Nick Stokes.

00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:22,300
I'm with the crime lab.

00:28:22,366 --> 00:28:23,935
I really appreciate you...

00:28:24,001 --> 00:28:26,070
coming down here
to talk with me.

00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:28,406
Okay, I'm going to make this
real easy for you.

00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:32,877
I know that Jonathan Danson
harassed you in the bar.

00:28:32,944 --> 00:28:36,247
And I know you were
in the booth that night

00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:38,082
planting
your pals' DVD.

00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:40,985
I also found evidence

00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:44,288
of sexual activity
on the command chair.

00:28:44,355 --> 00:28:46,357
Now, listen...

00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:48,092
if he assaulted you

00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,829
in any way and you fought back,
that's self-defense.

00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:54,132
You know that, right?

00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:57,735
It wasn't self-defense.

00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:03,608
I liked his show.

00:29:03,674 --> 00:29:06,244
<i>I think he must have</i>
<i>been able to sense that</i>

00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:08,579
<i>when he saw me at the bar.</i>

00:29:11,382 --> 00:29:13,451
I used to be
just like you.

00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:17,355
Tormented by impulses
I thought were dirty.

00:29:17,421 --> 00:29:18,890
Desires that
have no place

00:29:18,956 --> 00:29:21,092
in a squeaky-clean
universe.

00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:22,660
Let go of me.

00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:23,995
Let go of yourself.

00:29:24,061 --> 00:29:27,031
Stop trying to be
something you're not,

00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:30,001
and the guilt
that's eating you alive

00:29:30,067 --> 00:29:32,870
will fall away.

00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:35,673
Let me set you free.

00:29:40,044 --> 00:29:42,180
(collar buzzing)

00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:45,349
RISA:
<i>He took me...</i>

00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:48,152
<i>to an incredible place.</i>

00:29:50,855 --> 00:29:54,258
No preconceptions or judgments.

00:29:54,325 --> 00:29:56,194
Just...

00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,995
pure impulse

00:29:58,062 --> 00:29:59,897
and...

00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:01,732
raw instincts.

00:30:05,503 --> 00:30:08,439
He showed me who I really was.

00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:12,176
He even gave me
his cell phone number.

00:30:12,243 --> 00:30:15,413
He said he was going
to take me to Cabo.

00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:20,284
WILLOWS:
Well, I'd say that confirms
at least part of her story.

00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:24,155
Where did you
get this?

00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:26,657
Found it on the
vic's laptop.

00:30:26,724 --> 00:30:28,626
He has quite
a collection.

00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:40,905
And that's
Melinda Carver,

00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:42,640
his producer.

00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:47,612
It's about seven
hours before Risa,

00:30:47,678 --> 00:30:50,815
just before the
VIP premiere of his show.

00:30:53,117 --> 00:30:55,186
It's good to be
the commander.

00:31:01,853 --> 00:31:03,421
So, what's the point?

00:31:03,488 --> 00:31:05,323
The point is
that you didn't tell me

00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:06,824
that you were banging
the dead guy.

00:31:07,859 --> 00:31:09,794
That had nothing
to do with this.

00:31:09,861 --> 00:31:12,130
And you didn't tell me
you emptied out your 401(k)

00:31:12,196 --> 00:31:13,731
and gave all the money
to Danson.

00:31:13,798 --> 00:31:15,266
We checked his bank records.

00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:17,268
He needed it
to complete the project.

00:31:17,335 --> 00:31:20,405
Right. He's been completing
a lot of projects lately.

00:31:23,641 --> 00:31:25,643
And according
to the GPS tags

00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:28,613
on those photographs,
he's been working his mojo

00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:32,650
at most major sci-fi
conventions in America.

00:31:32,717 --> 00:31:34,419
He's a busy guy.

00:31:37,889 --> 00:31:39,724
I knew about the other women,

00:31:39,791 --> 00:31:42,927
because Jon told
me about them.

00:31:42,994 --> 00:31:46,631
We had an, uh, an
open relationship.

00:31:46,698 --> 00:31:50,301
Look... Jon was an extremely...

00:31:50,368 --> 00:31:52,737
complicated human being.

00:31:52,804 --> 00:31:55,907
(sighs)
He was trying
to expose

00:31:55,973 --> 00:31:58,776
the hypocrisy of a sick society.

00:31:58,843 --> 00:32:01,279
He was a
real artist,

00:32:01,346 --> 00:32:03,281
and that's all
that mattered to me,

00:32:03,348 --> 00:32:05,750
not who he was poking
in that chair.

00:32:05,817 --> 00:32:08,052
That's a nice speech.

00:32:09,821 --> 00:32:12,023
I'm done
talking to you.

00:32:15,393 --> 00:32:16,961
And that's a nice purse.

00:32:21,265 --> 00:32:23,134
I'm gonna have
to hang on to that.

00:32:24,335 --> 00:32:25,470
Check it for blood.

00:32:25,536 --> 00:32:28,439
Be my guest.

00:32:28,506 --> 00:32:31,009
ADAMS:
<i>The weird thing</i>
<i>about these photos</i>

00:32:31,075 --> 00:32:33,644
is the camera angle
and the background never change.

00:32:33,711 --> 00:32:36,047
Which means there must
be a hidden camera

00:32:36,114 --> 00:32:38,783
on the set somewhere?

00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:40,585
May I?
Yeah.

00:32:42,186 --> 00:32:43,621
Every shot, the victim's hand
is on that button.

00:32:43,688 --> 00:32:45,056
It must be
some kind of trigger.

00:32:45,123 --> 00:32:46,858
Mm-hmm.

00:32:46,924 --> 00:32:48,626
You didn't notice a camera?

00:32:48,693 --> 00:32:49,894
No, I didn't,
but, I mean,

00:32:49,961 --> 00:32:51,329
they make them
pretty small these days.

00:32:51,396 --> 00:32:53,331
Some of them even have
built-in memory.

00:32:53,398 --> 00:32:54,766
In other words,
if we find it,

00:32:54,832 --> 00:32:57,201
we may have a photo
of our killer.

00:33:03,641 --> 00:33:05,576
The background in the photo

00:33:05,643 --> 00:33:07,545
is this point here.

00:33:07,612 --> 00:33:08,846
The beam needs

00:33:08,913 --> 00:33:11,883
<i>to line up with the left arm</i>
<i>of the chair.</i>

00:33:11,949 --> 00:33:14,419
Bring it
up a bit.

00:33:14,485 --> 00:33:17,221
A little
bit more.

00:33:17,288 --> 00:33:18,289
Perfect.

00:33:22,894 --> 00:33:26,064
The camera should be
somewhere along this beam.

00:33:41,179 --> 00:33:44,449
I don't see
any camera here.

00:33:44,515 --> 00:33:47,652
Maybe Danson had a voyeur
buddy take the sex pics.

00:33:47,719 --> 00:33:51,489
Mm. From the same
exact angle every time?

00:34:19,217 --> 00:34:20,218
Wendy?

00:34:21,953 --> 00:34:23,154
I think I've got it.

00:34:23,221 --> 00:34:24,422
Got what?

00:34:24,489 --> 00:34:26,557
The metallic trace
from the victim's wound.

00:34:26,624 --> 00:34:28,059
Give me a second.

00:34:28,126 --> 00:34:30,862
Does this remind you
of anything?

00:34:35,466 --> 00:34:36,467
Yes.

00:34:36,534 --> 00:34:37,435
Right?
Yes.

00:34:37,502 --> 00:34:39,504
(keypad beeping)

00:34:40,505 --> 00:34:43,808
(phone rings)

00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:44,842
Langston.

00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:46,444
HODGES:
It's Hodges and Wendy.

00:34:46,511 --> 00:34:47,979
What do you got?

00:34:48,046 --> 00:34:50,748
Yeah, uh, we know
what killed Danson.

00:34:50,815 --> 00:34:52,050
It's in the helm.

00:34:52,116 --> 00:34:53,117
Okay, I'm going

00:34:53,184 --> 00:34:55,153
to put you
on speaker.

00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:56,954
Now, it's, it's
in the what?

00:34:57,021 --> 00:34:58,156
I-It's the console

00:34:58,222 --> 00:34:59,691
that's directly opposite
the command chair.

00:34:59,757 --> 00:35:01,025
There's a retractable viewer
inside.

00:35:01,092 --> 00:35:03,561
HODGES:
It's from the show.

00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,635
Looks like some kind
of piston system.

00:35:10,702 --> 00:35:12,136
Yeah, th-there should be
a control

00:35:12,203 --> 00:35:13,905
for it someplace.

00:35:13,971 --> 00:35:15,840
It's called a
targeting scanner.

00:35:17,742 --> 00:35:19,077
I think we have it.

00:35:21,946 --> 00:35:24,315
We also have a
digital sex camera.

00:35:24,382 --> 00:35:28,019
And blood, 90-degree angle.

00:35:28,086 --> 00:35:32,557
Silver metal paint
and a bloody fingerprint.

00:35:32,623 --> 00:35:34,459
Nice work, people.

00:35:34,525 --> 00:35:37,862
See you back at the lab.

00:35:37,929 --> 00:35:39,831
(closes phone)

00:35:39,897 --> 00:35:42,734
(chuckles)

00:35:54,112 --> 00:35:55,580
Nice work, Hodges.

00:35:55,646 --> 00:35:57,115
You, too, Simms.

00:36:04,622 --> 00:36:06,557
Is she mad at you again?

00:36:06,624 --> 00:36:08,760
Why don't
you two just

00:36:08,826 --> 00:36:10,328
get it over with?

00:36:10,395 --> 00:36:11,763
You've been dancing
around it for years.

00:36:11,829 --> 00:36:13,564
Just tell her how you feel.

00:36:13,631 --> 00:36:16,668
Tell her what, Mr. Andrews?

00:36:16,734 --> 00:36:21,706
That I'd never be able to
give myself to her fully?

00:36:23,408 --> 00:36:28,079
Because I've made a
commitment... to this lab.

00:36:28,146 --> 00:36:32,717
The pursuit of justice.

00:36:32,784 --> 00:36:35,219
Do you think it's easy?

00:36:35,286 --> 00:36:38,623
In the dead of night,
I can't help but wonder

00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:43,594
what it'd be like to savor
the pleasures of ordinary men.

00:36:43,661 --> 00:36:46,864
Moonlit dinners.

00:36:46,931 --> 00:36:50,101
Murmured endearments.

00:36:50,168 --> 00:36:55,073
The caress
of a woman's soft skin.

00:36:55,139 --> 00:36:57,842
Long, languid walks
on the beach.

00:36:57,909 --> 00:36:59,944
But you hate the beach.

00:37:00,011 --> 00:37:02,246
<i>It's understandable,</i>

00:37:02,313 --> 00:37:05,216
I guess,
considering your complexion.

00:37:07,685 --> 00:37:08,753
What?

00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,288
BRASS:
<i>It's good</i>

00:37:10,355 --> 00:37:11,689
<i>that you're politically active</i>
<i>because if you weren't,</i>

00:37:11,756 --> 00:37:13,524
you wouldn't have been arrested
at that sit-in

00:37:13,591 --> 00:37:16,027
at Global Media six years ago.

00:37:17,061 --> 00:37:20,098
Caught in the web
of the combine.

00:37:20,164 --> 00:37:21,799
Hm.

00:37:21,866 --> 00:37:23,134
That's a reference
to <i>One Fl...</i>

00:37:23,201 --> 00:37:24,769
Yeah, <i>One Flew Over</i>
<i>the Cuckoo's Nest.</i>

00:37:24,836 --> 00:37:27,839
I know.

00:37:27,905 --> 00:37:29,474
And I also know
that you didn't mean

00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:32,510
to kill
Jonathan Danson.

00:37:32,577 --> 00:37:34,979
I know that.

00:37:35,046 --> 00:37:37,415
It happened.

00:37:37,482 --> 00:37:40,084
But this is your one chance
to get out in front of it,

00:37:40,151 --> 00:37:41,185
so tell me
what happened.

00:37:41,252 --> 00:37:43,588
Just tell me
the truth,

00:37:43,655 --> 00:37:45,990
and I promise I'll do
everything I can to help you.

00:37:46,057 --> 00:37:48,059
I will.

00:37:50,662 --> 00:37:55,466
Jonathan Danson took
my media semiotics course.

00:37:55,533 --> 00:37:57,201
He was a good student.

00:37:57,268 --> 00:37:59,303
Mm-hmm.

00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:00,838
I heard about his project

00:38:00,905 --> 00:38:02,273
and thought it would be
perfect material

00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:03,708
for my documentary.

00:38:03,775 --> 00:38:05,243
Ah.

00:38:05,309 --> 00:38:08,680
But then I saw <i>Redux.</i>

00:38:08,746 --> 00:38:10,515
I'm gonna do her!
I swear I'm gonna do her!

00:38:10,581 --> 00:38:12,150
<i>I gave a lecture once,</i>

00:38:12,216 --> 00:38:15,553
<i>deconstructing</i> Astro Quest
<i>as an example.</i>

00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:16,688
(gunshot)

00:38:17,488 --> 00:38:18,923
(body thuds)

00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:22,026
<i>Jonathan had integrated</i>
<i>all of my conceits</i>

00:38:22,093 --> 00:38:24,729
<i>into his fictional construct.</i>

00:38:24,796 --> 00:38:27,365
He stole your idea.

00:38:27,432 --> 00:38:28,866
He didn't ask for permission.

00:38:28,933 --> 00:38:32,403
He... He didn't even
acknowledge me in the credits.

00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:34,339
You want credit?

00:38:34,405 --> 00:38:36,107
Now, why would
I give you that?

00:38:36,174 --> 00:38:38,576
Because they're
my ideas.

00:38:38,643 --> 00:38:42,180
Whatever happened
to "Nobody can own an idea"?

00:38:42,246 --> 00:38:43,281
Let me tell you
something.

00:38:43,348 --> 00:38:45,950
Ideas are a dime a dozen.

00:38:46,017 --> 00:38:47,418
If you want to make them
into art,

00:38:47,485 --> 00:38:49,220
it takes drive,
vision, creativity.

00:38:49,287 --> 00:38:51,456
Hey, I have created...

00:38:51,522 --> 00:38:52,457
What?

00:38:52,523 --> 00:38:54,826
Hyperintellectual diarrhea?

00:38:56,961 --> 00:38:58,529
Go back to writing theory papers

00:38:58,596 --> 00:39:02,600
for the six other people in
your department who read them.

00:39:05,269 --> 00:39:06,738
I've got a TV show to make.

00:39:06,804 --> 00:39:09,207
You! You!

00:39:13,644 --> 00:39:14,579
Let me go!

00:39:14,645 --> 00:39:15,713
Not till you
cool down.

00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,281
Are you gonna be cool?

00:39:17,348 --> 00:39:19,617
(quietly):
Yes.

00:39:20,651 --> 00:39:23,187
20 years devoted
to media theory.

00:39:24,222 --> 00:39:26,924
Talk about a wasted life.

00:39:28,059 --> 00:39:29,994
(screams)
(grunts)

00:39:31,229 --> 00:39:32,864
(gasping)

00:39:36,534 --> 00:39:39,737
<i>You see the irony, don't you?</i>

00:39:39,804 --> 00:39:43,441
<i>Jon attempted to deconstruct</i>
Astro Quest's <i>iconography,</i>

00:39:43,508 --> 00:39:45,176
and he was killed

00:39:45,243 --> 00:39:48,680
by one of the signifiers
he sought to subvert.

00:39:50,214 --> 00:39:53,117
Derrida, Derrida
would have called that...

00:39:53,184 --> 00:39:56,421
An epistemological
dichotomy?

00:39:56,487 --> 00:40:00,858
I just call it
second-degree murder.

00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:10,668
Anybody up
for a little <i>Astro Quest?</i>

00:40:10,735 --> 00:40:11,936
Oh, no, not tonight.

00:40:12,003 --> 00:40:13,137
Thanks, though.

00:40:13,204 --> 00:40:15,206
All right.

00:40:16,908 --> 00:40:18,843
Break room in five.

00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:19,844
Let's go.

00:40:19,911 --> 00:40:20,912
Uh, no, thanks.

00:40:20,978 --> 00:40:23,681
Enjoy.

00:40:23,748 --> 00:40:25,249
STOKES:
"A Dollop of Apocalypse."

00:40:25,316 --> 00:40:26,284
LANGSTON:
Oh, that's the one

00:40:26,351 --> 00:40:27,552
where they find
this planet

00:40:27,618 --> 00:40:29,320
where, um, amphibians
are the dominant species,

00:40:29,387 --> 00:40:31,322
and they worship <i>Peyton Place</i>

00:40:31,389 --> 00:40:32,323
as a sacred text.

00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:33,925
It's classic.

00:40:33,992 --> 00:40:37,562
ADAMS:
W-Wait, the amphibians can
read and they choose that?

00:40:37,628 --> 00:40:39,630
LANGSTON:
There's a reason
for it. You'll see.

00:40:46,471 --> 00:40:49,674
(typing)

00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:53,845
HODGES:
<i>Jihw-CHOK</i>

00:40:53,911 --> 00:40:55,847
<i>chom-CHEM</i>

00:40:55,913 --> 00:40:59,884
<i>jag-eej BRYCE cichoki.</i>

00:40:59,951 --> 00:41:01,586
SIMMS:
<i>I don't speak Vellikon.</i>

00:41:01,652 --> 00:41:02,887
<i>What'd you say?</i>

00:41:18,436 --> 00:41:22,807
Anytime you're ready, Ecklie.

00:41:22,874 --> 00:41:27,011
You will leave
me... now?

00:41:27,078 --> 00:41:30,248
The lab needs me.

00:41:30,314 --> 00:41:34,352
You have needs of
your own, as do I.

00:41:38,156 --> 00:41:42,960
Maybe, someday,
our needs will coincide.

00:41:44,295 --> 00:41:46,464
I hope so.

00:41:46,531 --> 00:41:47,999
Till then...

00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,669
(electronic whirring)

00:41:55,807 --> 00:41:58,009
Someday.
