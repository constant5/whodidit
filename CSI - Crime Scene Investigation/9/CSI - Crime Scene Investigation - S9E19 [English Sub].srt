00:00:05,613 --> 00:00:06,881
MAN:
Okay, we're rolling.


00:00:06,948 --> 00:00:08,349
(buzzer sounds)


00:00:08,416 --> 00:00:10,117
Let's go!
(laughs)


00:00:11,118 --> 00:00:14,755
(man speaks French)


00:00:16,324 --> 00:00:19,961
<i>Un, deux, et trois!</i>


00:00:20,027 --> 00:00:22,463
(whooping)


00:00:23,764 --> 00:00:27,335
(yells)


00:00:27,401 --> 00:00:28,703
Whoo!


00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:29,837
Come back, come back!


00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:31,739
Now!


00:00:31,806 --> 00:00:34,342
Come together!
Whoo-hoo!


00:00:36,844 --> 00:00:38,546
And break!


00:00:38,613 --> 00:00:40,715
Bye-bye!


00:00:40,781 --> 00:00:41,849
Whoo!


00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:43,217
Whoo!


00:00:43,284 --> 00:00:45,520
(man grunting)


00:00:47,188 --> 00:00:50,658
(panicked grunting)


00:00:56,831 --> 00:00:59,534
(grunting continues)


00:01:01,636 --> 00:01:03,571
(static crackles)


00:01:03,638 --> 00:01:06,407
(screaming)


00:01:06,474 --> 00:01:09,343
(loud thud)


00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:13,314
(groaning)


00:01:13,381 --> 00:01:17,285
(gasping)


00:01:17,351 --> 00:01:18,419
Buddy, are you all right?!


00:01:18,486 --> 00:01:19,654
Are you alive?!


00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,655
(groaning)


00:01:20,721 --> 00:01:22,423
All right, don't move!


00:01:25,326 --> 00:01:27,895
Pierre! Oh, my God!


00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:29,564
Where the hell
is the ambulance!


00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:32,500
Go, go call an ambulance! Go!


00:01:32,567 --> 00:01:33,634
Okay, help, somebody!


00:01:33,701 --> 00:01:35,536
Pierre, baby, baby,
are you okay?


00:01:35,603 --> 00:01:38,573
(siren wails)


00:01:38,639 --> 00:01:40,575
It's all right, sir,
do you feel your legs?


00:01:40,641 --> 00:01:42,510
I'm gonna check his airway.
His airway's good.


00:01:42,577 --> 00:01:46,047
Sir, I'm gonna take
your helmet off.


00:01:46,113 --> 00:01:49,717
Careful. It's okay, sir.
Do you know where you are?


00:01:49,784 --> 00:01:51,052
(groans)


00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:53,120
Let's get that airway.
Let's get that airway package.


00:01:53,187 --> 00:01:55,489
Let's get the backboard.
Do you understand me, sir?


00:01:55,556 --> 00:01:57,959
(indistinct radio transmission)


00:02:05,199 --> 00:02:07,001
STOKES: We're crime scene
investigators, Sheriff.


00:02:07,068 --> 00:02:08,402
We don't normally
get called out


00:02:08,469 --> 00:02:09,570
on something like this.


00:02:09,637 --> 00:02:11,973
But I'm telling you,
this is a crime.


00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:15,309
Look, I know the jumper,
all right?


00:02:15,376 --> 00:02:17,578
Pierre Delongue
and I served together


00:02:17,645 --> 00:02:19,080
in the French Foreign Legion.


00:02:19,146 --> 00:02:23,084
What? It's a real thing.


00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:25,453
Pierre's logged over
1,500 jumps.


00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,923
He's absolutely fanatical
about preparation and safety.


00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:31,325
His school hasn't had
a single citation


00:02:31,392 --> 00:02:32,493
of any kind.


00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,296
You know what?
He-he's too careful


00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:37,198
to have something
like this happen by accident.


00:02:37,265 --> 00:02:39,133
All right.


00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,868
We're gonna need to
talk to some witnesses.


00:02:40,935 --> 00:02:42,436
I'll round 'em up.


00:02:42,503 --> 00:02:44,405
(static crackles)


00:02:45,806 --> 00:02:47,308
What do you
got, Riley?


00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,310
A helmet videocam.


00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:51,245
I think it's still on.


00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:56,717
(static crackles)


00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:59,720

I'm sorry. I just... I'm
really emotional about this.


00:03:38,233 --> 00:03:40,069
I just need a moment.


00:03:40,135 --> 00:03:42,204
It's okay.
Take your time.


00:03:42,271 --> 00:03:43,305
Did Pierre give
any indication


00:03:43,372 --> 00:03:45,307
that there was anything
wrong during the jump?


00:03:45,374 --> 00:03:46,742
I don't know what happened.


00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:49,344
You know, we've made this
jump, like, a hundred times.


00:03:49,411 --> 00:03:51,613
Everything was
going perfect.


00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,553
<i>We formed the star,</i>
<i>backflipped, 360'd,</i>


00:03:57,619 --> 00:04:00,723
<i>reformed exactly as planned.</i>


00:04:00,789 --> 00:04:04,326
<i>We deployed, but...</i>


00:04:04,393 --> 00:04:06,729
<i>he just kept falling.</i>


00:04:06,795 --> 00:04:08,797
(screaming)


00:04:08,864 --> 00:04:10,566
Everything was perfect,
it was like...


00:04:10,632 --> 00:04:13,502
Well, did you ever do it?


00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:15,037
Well, I've done a little
paragliding.


00:04:15,104 --> 00:04:17,473
Oh, you should try
the real thing.


00:04:17,539 --> 00:04:19,108
You know, bodies
linked in air.


00:04:19,174 --> 00:04:23,212
And... And the Earth coming at
you like the fist of death,


00:04:23,278 --> 00:04:27,249
and the wind is, like,
it blows up your leg holes.


00:04:27,316 --> 00:04:30,252
Pierre lived for that.


00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:31,754
(car clanking)


00:04:38,394 --> 00:04:39,962
(French accent):
Bonjour.


00:04:42,264 --> 00:04:43,932
They told me Pierre
have an accident.


00:04:43,999 --> 00:04:45,100
Yeah. Who are you?


00:04:45,167 --> 00:04:46,235
I'm Max Girard,


00:04:46,301 --> 00:04:47,569
Pierre's partner.


00:04:47,636 --> 00:04:51,473
Pierre and I, we have
a jump school there.


00:04:53,742 --> 00:04:56,512
(helicopter blades whirring)


00:04:56,578 --> 00:04:57,980
Is he dead?


00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:00,582
He's at Desert Palm, man.
He's in pretty bad shape.


00:05:00,649 --> 00:05:02,885
(sobs)
At least we can take
comfort in the fact


00:05:02,951 --> 00:05:04,353
that he died doing
what he loved.


00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,954
He's not dead yet.


00:05:06,021 --> 00:05:07,156
MAX:
<i>Regard...</i>


00:05:07,222 --> 00:05:10,726
Pierre and I are brothers.


00:05:10,793 --> 00:05:12,861
Not really brothers,
but like brothers.


00:05:12,928 --> 00:05:14,563
We come here


00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:18,500
together from Belgium,
we build this business.


00:05:18,567 --> 00:05:20,436
What happened to your leg?


00:05:20,502 --> 00:05:22,237
Same thing that
happened to my car.


00:05:22,304 --> 00:05:23,472
It's nothing.


00:05:25,007 --> 00:05:27,109
I will go to
see my partner.


00:05:27,176 --> 00:05:28,510
I want to go, too.
So do I.


00:05:28,577 --> 00:05:30,479
Sir, we may need to
talk to you later.


00:05:30,546 --> 00:05:31,847
Where can we find you?


00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:33,282
At the hospital.


00:05:33,349 --> 00:05:35,818
At Pierre's side.


00:05:35,884 --> 00:05:37,686
Hey, <i>les deux,</i> into the car.


00:05:37,753 --> 00:05:40,989
(speaking French)


00:05:41,056 --> 00:05:43,058
Go, go, go, go!


00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:44,593
So what do you think?


00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:47,629
I think if you jump out
of a plane enough times,


00:05:47,696 --> 00:05:49,164
that one day, one way
or another,


00:05:49,231 --> 00:05:51,633
your luck's gonna run out.


00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,102
(bird screeches)


00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,809
(birds calling)


00:06:08,884 --> 00:06:10,853
When I first noticed
<i>Cathartes aura,</i>


00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:12,821
the common
turkey vulture,


00:06:12,888 --> 00:06:15,190
I assumed they were
scavenging, some, uh,


00:06:15,257 --> 00:06:16,925
large desert mammal.


00:06:16,992 --> 00:06:19,495
When I got closer...


00:06:19,561 --> 00:06:21,296
imagine my dismay.


00:06:22,331 --> 00:06:23,499
(camera shutter clicks)


00:06:23,565 --> 00:06:25,300
OFFICER: And exactly
what were you doing


00:06:25,367 --> 00:06:26,468
out here all alone, sir?


00:06:26,535 --> 00:06:29,671
I'm a landscape
photographer.


00:06:29,738 --> 00:06:31,607
I used to be a bird-watcher,


00:06:31,673 --> 00:06:34,443
but I gave it up--
too much death.


00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,316
(flies buzzing)


00:06:50,225 --> 00:06:52,861
The DB is a white male,

00:06:52,928 --> 00:06:55,064
probably in his 30s.

00:06:55,130 --> 00:07:00,269
Exposed flesh on the face, neck,
arms, legs appears

00:07:00,335 --> 00:07:01,804
to be scavenged.

00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:05,674
The eye sockets are empty
and bloody.

00:07:05,741 --> 00:07:08,477
Uh, birds of prey always go
for the eyeballs first.

00:07:08,544 --> 00:07:10,446
Yes. They're moist,
nutritious,

00:07:10,512 --> 00:07:13,682
easily reachable, well before
the hide has a chance

00:07:13,749 --> 00:07:16,618
to ripen and burst.

00:07:16,685 --> 00:07:19,321
The victim's clothing suggests
a person of a religious

00:07:19,388 --> 00:07:20,989
or ascetic nature.

00:07:21,056 --> 00:07:22,591
The legs are folded

00:07:22,658 --> 00:07:24,660
in the lotus position;
he may have been

00:07:24,727 --> 00:07:26,528
meditating when he died.

00:07:26,595 --> 00:07:29,565
Amongst the various animal
tracks,

00:07:29,631 --> 00:07:31,333
consistent with the predation,

00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,969
there is a single set
of shoe impressions

00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:35,170
leading to the body.

00:07:35,237 --> 00:07:38,073
I swear, I never got
any closer than this.

00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,908
Will you lift your feet, please?

00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:44,580
Officer, you walked in
to check out the body

00:07:44,646 --> 00:07:47,049
and walked out
using your own steps?

00:07:47,116 --> 00:07:48,617
I took a class.

00:07:50,352 --> 00:07:54,023
There is a single set
of barefoot human tracks.

00:07:54,089 --> 00:07:56,525
I will document them,

00:07:56,592 --> 00:07:59,595
determine whether they belong
to the victim.

00:07:59,661 --> 00:08:02,398
There appear to be
no other tracks,

00:08:02,464 --> 00:08:05,367
but judging from the sandy
quality of the terrain,

00:08:05,434 --> 00:08:07,536
it is possible
someone walked in

00:08:07,603 --> 00:08:10,706
and covered their tracks
on the way out.

00:08:10,773 --> 00:08:13,742
Such a lonely
place to die.

00:08:13,809 --> 00:08:16,879
What place isn't, my friend?
What place isn't?

00:08:21,216 --> 00:08:23,852
(liquid pouring)

00:08:25,521 --> 00:08:29,024
We find at least a couple guys
like this

00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:30,859
out in the desert every year.

00:08:30,926 --> 00:08:33,228
The sands tends to call out
to the spiritually inclined.

00:08:33,295 --> 00:08:35,397
It's all very biblical

00:08:35,464 --> 00:08:37,766
and very dusty.

00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:39,168
LANGSTON:
He had plenty of water.

00:08:39,234 --> 00:08:42,037
So I guess he didn't die
of dehydration.

00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:43,639
Hmm.

00:08:45,674 --> 00:08:48,644
Pistachios.
My favorite nut.

00:08:48,711 --> 00:08:50,746
Salty and easy to open.

00:08:50,813 --> 00:08:54,116
Speaking of which...
shall we?

00:08:54,183 --> 00:08:55,718
Indeed.

00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,102
Nice ink.

00:09:13,168 --> 00:09:16,004
"Holy Steven."

00:09:16,071 --> 00:09:17,172
(Hodges chuckles)

00:09:29,752 --> 00:09:33,489
"Spread the word.
I am come."

00:09:33,555 --> 00:09:35,791
And you is gone.

00:09:35,858 --> 00:09:37,326

00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,954
Hey.

Hey.

00:10:07,056 --> 00:10:09,058
How's the jumper?

00:10:09,124 --> 00:10:10,059
Well,

00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:12,561
you could ask his pelvis,

00:10:12,628 --> 00:10:14,897
which you will find
in his rib cage.

00:10:14,963 --> 00:10:16,498
His neck is broken,

00:10:16,565 --> 00:10:18,934
his legs are broken,

00:10:19,001 --> 00:10:21,670
his ribs and fingers
are broken.

00:10:21,737 --> 00:10:23,739
Basically, all of him is broken.

00:10:23,806 --> 00:10:25,240
Is he still in surgery?

00:10:25,307 --> 00:10:26,075
Yeah.

00:10:26,141 --> 00:10:28,610
Okay.

00:10:28,677 --> 00:10:29,712
Here's what I got.

00:10:29,778 --> 00:10:31,580
This is
Pierre's rig,

00:10:31,647 --> 00:10:33,816
and this is an identical,
properly-packed chute.

00:10:33,882 --> 00:10:35,451
Uh, we know
the EMS team

00:10:35,517 --> 00:10:37,519
cut Pierre out of his rig
before they moved him.

00:10:37,586 --> 00:10:38,754
But the canopy
is only connected

00:10:38,821 --> 00:10:40,422
to the harness
on one side.

00:10:40,489 --> 00:10:42,991
<i>That would've</i>
<i>tangled the chute.</i>

00:10:43,058 --> 00:10:44,226
Main chute rip cord's here,

00:10:44,293 --> 00:10:46,428
cutaway harness here.

00:10:46,495 --> 00:10:47,429
Both were deployed.

00:10:47,496 --> 00:10:48,831
Okay, hold on.

00:10:48,897 --> 00:10:50,032
What's a cutaway?

00:10:50,099 --> 00:10:51,300
Okay, the cutaway
mechanism's designed

00:10:51,367 --> 00:10:53,102
to release the canopy
from the harness entirely.

00:10:53,168 --> 00:10:54,503
It's not meant
to be deployed

00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,505
in mid-air, unless this

00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:57,840
main chute here is tangled.

00:10:57,906 --> 00:11:01,009
(Pierre grunting)

00:11:01,076 --> 00:11:03,045
So if it was deployed,

00:11:03,112 --> 00:11:05,214
why didn't the main chute
detach completely?

00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,082
Because of this pull-up cord
right here.

00:11:07,149 --> 00:11:09,018
It's designed to

00:11:09,084 --> 00:11:11,687
crimp these straps together
on the chute

00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,022
while packing it.
It's then released

00:11:13,088 --> 00:11:15,224
<i>before the jumper</i>
<i>puts on the harness.</i>

00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:16,692
<i>But on Pierre's chute,</i>

00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,761
a little piece
of it's broken off,

00:11:18,827 --> 00:11:19,762
<i>preventing</i>
<i>the three-ring mechanism</i>

00:11:19,828 --> 00:11:21,230
<i>from releasing the riser.</i>

00:11:21,296 --> 00:11:24,066
So what you're saying is
it's simple equipment failure?

00:11:24,133 --> 00:11:27,569
If that were the only thing
wrong, yeah, I would be.

00:11:27,636 --> 00:11:29,304
But Pierre's reserve chute
was still packed.

00:11:29,371 --> 00:11:32,241
It failed to deploy, even though
he pulled the reserve handle.

00:11:32,307 --> 00:11:33,542
How do you know that?

00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:36,845
Because of this little cable.

00:11:36,912 --> 00:11:39,648
It's supposed to have a crimped
cap on the end, like this.

00:11:39,715 --> 00:11:40,949
Without it, the wire

00:11:41,016 --> 00:11:42,651
<i>goes through</i>
<i>the reserve chute's D-ring</i>

00:11:42,718 --> 00:11:45,220
<i>without activating it.</i>

00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:46,822
I'm telling
you, the odds

00:11:46,889 --> 00:11:51,160
against a double failure
like this are astronomical.

00:11:51,226 --> 00:11:53,028
I thought these guys
were fanatical

00:11:53,095 --> 00:11:54,129
about checking
their own equipment.

00:11:54,196 --> 00:11:55,364
They're
supposed to be.

00:11:55,431 --> 00:11:58,233
I'll swab these release
mechanisms for touch DNA

00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,203
and see if anybody else put
their paws on Pierre's stuff.

00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,871
I'm thinking
somebody...

00:12:02,938 --> 00:12:04,506
BOTH:
...messed with his chute.

00:12:04,573 --> 00:12:05,841
Yeah.

00:12:05,908 --> 00:12:09,945
All of the animal
bites were postmortem.

00:12:10,012 --> 00:12:12,915
I found teeth impressions--
probably coyotes

00:12:12,981 --> 00:12:15,484
as well as beaked
birds of prey--

00:12:15,551 --> 00:12:17,820
but they didn't get very far.

00:12:17,886 --> 00:12:19,221
He wasn't dead very long.

00:12:19,288 --> 00:12:22,458
When I got there,
rigor was still full.

00:12:22,524 --> 00:12:25,694
Interesting.

00:12:25,761 --> 00:12:27,996
Amoeboid-shaped bleed
on the cerebrum.

00:12:28,063 --> 00:12:31,033
Spans the junction
of the motor cortex

00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,701
and the sensory cortex.
Hmm...

00:12:43,011 --> 00:12:44,580
It runs deep.

00:12:44,646 --> 00:12:48,317
Yeah, hematoma's definitely
large enough to be COD.

00:12:48,384 --> 00:12:50,652
Corresponds to this injury here.

00:12:50,719 --> 00:12:53,689
That doesn't look
like an animal bite.

00:12:53,756 --> 00:12:56,358
More likely blunt force trauma.

00:12:56,425 --> 00:12:58,394
You're saying someone cracked
him on the top of his head?

00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,496
Fall would have caused trauma
to the forehead,

00:13:00,562 --> 00:13:04,566
back or side
of the head.

00:13:04,633 --> 00:13:06,001
This injury's
right on top.

00:13:06,068 --> 00:13:09,405
He was sitting cross-legged
when he died.

00:13:09,471 --> 00:13:10,672
It's virtually impossible
to fall

00:13:10,739 --> 00:13:12,574
and hit the top of your head

00:13:12,641 --> 00:13:14,343
from that position.
(cell phone ringing)

00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:16,412
Excuse me.

00:13:23,185 --> 00:13:24,119
This is Langston.

00:13:24,186 --> 00:13:25,354
BRASS:
Hey, Professor.

00:13:25,421 --> 00:13:27,356
Yeah, I was running a check
on Holy Steven.

00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,924
He wasn't hard to find.

00:13:28,991 --> 00:13:30,659
He likes to preach
at downtown shelters.

00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:34,063
Anyway, his name is not,
uh, Steven, by the way.

00:13:34,129 --> 00:13:38,333
It's, uh, Mark VonGrovestreet.

00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,702
Why'd he change it?

00:13:39,768 --> 00:13:41,236
I have no idea.

00:13:41,303 --> 00:13:42,805
<i>Anyway, I have an address.</i>

00:13:42,871 --> 00:13:44,873
<i>You might like to come along.</i>

00:14:10,532 --> 00:14:13,635
(man murmuring nearby)

00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:22,044
(murmured chanting continues)

00:14:29,418 --> 00:14:31,053
Hi. Las Vegas Police.

00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,855
I'm Detective Jim Brass.

00:14:32,921 --> 00:14:34,857
This is Ray Langston
from the crime lab.

00:14:34,923 --> 00:14:35,858
(chuckles):
Welcome.

00:14:35,924 --> 00:14:37,626
Welcome, welcome, welcome,

00:14:37,693 --> 00:14:38,727
siblings.

00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:40,529
Welcome to The Church
of the Holy George.

00:14:40,596 --> 00:14:41,530
And you are, uh...?

00:14:41,597 --> 00:14:43,932
He.

00:14:43,999 --> 00:14:45,801
George.

00:14:45,868 --> 00:14:46,835
Here, please.

00:14:46,902 --> 00:14:48,804
Thank you, George.
Please...

00:14:48,871 --> 00:14:51,807
What happened to The Church
of the Holy Steven?

00:14:51,874 --> 00:14:53,709
Oh, have you not heard the word?

00:14:53,776 --> 00:14:56,779
No, The Steven
is the divine Second Coming.

00:14:56,845 --> 00:14:59,415
He is the mouthpiece
and messenger

00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:00,949
and clarion of God.

00:15:01,016 --> 00:15:02,217
He's also dead.

00:15:02,284 --> 00:15:03,218
Oh.

00:15:03,285 --> 00:15:04,887
Yeah.

00:15:04,953 --> 00:15:07,122
You don't seem too surprised
to hear that. Why is that?

00:15:07,189 --> 00:15:08,891
I had a vision that it was so.

00:15:08,957 --> 00:15:10,159
Oh, really? Okay.

00:15:10,225 --> 00:15:12,027
So, when was the last time
you saw him?

00:15:12,094 --> 00:15:13,429
I mean, other than your dream.

00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:14,930
Huh?

00:15:16,932 --> 00:15:19,835
(George gasps)

00:15:19,902 --> 00:15:22,671
(murmured chanting)

00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:27,943
George?
(gasps)

00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,179
Oh.
(laughs)

00:15:30,245 --> 00:15:31,547
Yes, The Steven and I

00:15:31,613 --> 00:15:35,084
<i>wandered in the desert</i>
<i>for three days and two nights.</i>

00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:38,053
<i>On the third day,</i>

00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,988
<i>The Steven instructed me</i>

00:15:40,055 --> 00:15:43,459
<i>to return to spread his word</i>
<i>as my own</i>

00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:45,527
<i>to the people</i>
<i>of the cities and towns.</i>

00:15:45,594 --> 00:15:48,030
<i>And he bestowed his staff</i>

00:15:48,097 --> 00:15:51,033
<i>upon me,</i>
<i>and then he continued on</i>

00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,735
<i>into the desert alone.</i>

00:15:52,801 --> 00:15:53,736
(thunder rumbles)

00:15:53,802 --> 00:15:55,037
(laughs)

00:15:55,104 --> 00:15:59,141
I held his rod and staff,

00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,276
and I saw that it was good.

00:16:01,343 --> 00:16:03,212
(chuckles)

00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:07,049
But then I wept, for I knew
that Steven's quest

00:16:07,116 --> 00:16:10,152
was for reabsorption

00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:13,188
into the Total Animal Soup
of Time.

00:16:13,255 --> 00:16:17,926
You mean you knew that
The Steven was going to die?

00:16:17,993 --> 00:16:19,028
Oh, no.

00:16:19,094 --> 00:16:22,031
There is no death,
only transmogrification.

00:16:22,097 --> 00:16:23,599
Well, that's a relief.

00:16:23,665 --> 00:16:25,834
(laughs)

00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:27,669
So, uh, when did
all this happen?

00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:28,971
Uh, what's today?

00:16:29,038 --> 00:16:30,339
Friday.
Yes.

00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:33,842
We left on Saturday, and then I
returned on, uh, Tuesday.

00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:35,577
And that's when you
renamed your church.

00:16:35,644 --> 00:16:37,746
(laughs):
I... I did.

00:16:37,813 --> 00:16:38,747
You saw.

00:16:38,814 --> 00:16:41,016
Yes, I did.

00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,284
Is that the staff there?

00:16:42,351 --> 00:16:43,819
Oh, yes it is.

00:16:43,886 --> 00:16:44,920
Indeed, it is.

00:16:44,987 --> 00:16:46,789
Wow, this is just
like Sunday school.

00:16:46,855 --> 00:16:47,790
Here's the Gospel

00:16:47,856 --> 00:16:49,992
according to Jim...

00:16:50,059 --> 00:16:53,328
I think you took that staff
and clubbed the Holy Steve

00:16:53,395 --> 00:16:55,064
like a baby
harp seal...

00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:57,633
<i>so you could become</i>
<i>the number one sky pilot...</i>

00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,801
(groans)

00:17:00,169 --> 00:17:02,104
<i>...and take over</i>
<i>this whole operation.</i>

00:17:02,171 --> 00:17:04,306
Hmm... You do?

00:17:04,373 --> 00:17:05,641
Yes, I do.

00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:07,943
(whispers):
Yes.

00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:10,012
Yes, I did.

00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,716
I raised the staff,
as Abraham to Isaac,

00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:16,285
but there was no angel
to stay my hand,

00:17:16,352 --> 00:17:17,986
so... I smote him.

00:17:18,053 --> 00:17:19,088
BRASS:
You smote him.

00:17:19,154 --> 00:17:20,456
You realize that's
a confession, George?

00:17:20,522 --> 00:17:22,124
You understand that, right?

00:17:22,191 --> 00:17:23,125
Yes, yes.

00:17:23,192 --> 00:17:24,760
Are you, are you
going to arrest me?

00:17:24,827 --> 00:17:26,128
Yes, I am.

00:17:26,195 --> 00:17:27,129
Yes.

00:17:27,196 --> 00:17:28,197
(chuckles):
Yes.

00:17:28,263 --> 00:17:30,466
(breathes deeply)

00:17:32,701 --> 00:17:33,535
(murmured chanting)

00:17:36,949 --> 00:17:38,809
PIERRE:
Okay, testing, testing.

00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:41,512
Uh, what did one
dehydrated Frenchman

00:17:41,578 --> 00:17:43,647
say to the other?

00:17:43,714 --> 00:17:45,849
"What do you want me to do,
Pee Air?"

00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:47,751
(Pierre and women laughing)

00:17:47,818 --> 00:17:48,852
Okay, let's go.

00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:50,421
MINK:
Pierre, you're so funny!

00:17:50,487 --> 00:17:51,822
It all looks like

00:17:51,889 --> 00:17:53,524
standard operating
procedure.

00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:55,025
PIERRE:
Hello, <i>mon 'ti chou.</i>

00:17:55,092 --> 00:17:56,026
(Pierre chuckles)

00:17:56,093 --> 00:17:57,361
Hello.

00:17:57,428 --> 00:17:58,529
Hey, baby.

00:17:58,595 --> 00:18:00,831
Okay...
(speaks French)

00:18:00,898 --> 00:18:02,333
Looks like a little
bit of tension

00:18:02,399 --> 00:18:03,634
between the two ladies there.

00:18:03,701 --> 00:18:06,203
Mm-hmm.

00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:10,007
(whooping and laughing)

00:18:10,974 --> 00:18:13,344
Hold on, freeze it, right there.

00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:14,345
Look at their hands.

00:18:14,411 --> 00:18:16,046
Either one of those chicks

00:18:16,113 --> 00:18:17,681
could have deployed
Pierre's cutaway release

00:18:17,748 --> 00:18:19,450
right there in free fall,

00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:21,652
after he'd already
checked his rig on the plane.

00:18:21,719 --> 00:18:23,654
You ever think about skydiving?

00:18:23,721 --> 00:18:25,122
Not anymore.

00:18:25,189 --> 00:18:27,191
Keep playing it.

00:18:30,627 --> 00:18:33,831
(whooping)

00:18:37,868 --> 00:18:41,705
(panicked grunting)

00:18:41,772 --> 00:18:43,707
(static crackles)

00:18:43,774 --> 00:18:46,343
(Pierre screaming)

00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:47,911
(crashing thud)

00:18:47,978 --> 00:18:51,348
I think it's about time I had
a little chat with the ladies.

00:18:51,415 --> 00:18:55,019
Pierre, Max, Mink and me,
we were like,

00:18:55,085 --> 00:18:58,455
we were like
one big happy family.

00:18:58,522 --> 00:19:00,491
Closer, even.

00:19:00,557 --> 00:19:02,226
We trusted each other
with our lives

00:19:02,292 --> 00:19:04,828
every day.

00:19:04,895 --> 00:19:06,296
Oh.

00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,335
Ah...

00:19:12,636 --> 00:19:13,637
(sighs)

00:19:13,704 --> 00:19:17,808
We all loved each other so much.

00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:21,445
Pierre loved to make me laugh.

00:19:21,512 --> 00:19:23,514
He was so funny.

00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,449
Pee Air--

00:19:25,516 --> 00:19:27,851
get it, Pierre?

00:19:27,918 --> 00:19:29,119
SCHUYLER:
<i>He was a wild man.</i>

00:19:29,186 --> 00:19:33,757
Big where it counts--
in his heart.

00:19:33,824 --> 00:19:37,428
I mean, I don't even know
what I'm doing here.

00:19:37,494 --> 00:19:39,930
My fiancÃ© is dying,
and I just don't understand

00:19:39,997 --> 00:19:42,633
what all of you people
want from me.

00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,368
SCHUYLER:
"FiancÃ©"? Wait.

00:19:44,435 --> 00:19:46,337
She called him that?
She called him her fiancÃ©?

00:19:46,403 --> 00:19:48,706
She doesn't even speak French.

00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:51,008
He was never gonna marry her.

00:19:51,075 --> 00:19:54,478
That pathetic, deluded bitch!

00:19:54,545 --> 00:19:56,213
She called me a bitch?

00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,115
That...
...bitch!

00:19:58,182 --> 00:20:00,317
MINX:
She thinks that I don't know

00:20:00,384 --> 00:20:02,086
what she was doing--
sneaking around,

00:20:02,152 --> 00:20:03,954
trying to take him away from me.

00:20:04,021 --> 00:20:05,289
I am the one he loved.

00:20:05,356 --> 00:20:07,124
He was just doing her
out of pity.

00:20:07,191 --> 00:20:09,326
Pity? She said that?

00:20:09,393 --> 00:20:10,694
SCHUYLER:
Unbelievable.

00:20:10,761 --> 00:20:13,497
What a slut.

00:20:13,564 --> 00:20:15,132
You know what I think?

00:20:15,199 --> 00:20:18,769
I think maybe you killed Pierre
out of jealousy.

00:20:18,836 --> 00:20:20,304
(scoffs):
What?

00:20:20,371 --> 00:20:21,839
You heard me.

00:20:21,905 --> 00:20:23,540
Really?

00:20:25,042 --> 00:20:27,511
MAX:
<i>Eh, don't let either</i>
<i>of them fool you.</i>

00:20:27,578 --> 00:20:31,548
In my opinion, they could have
decided to kill him together.

00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:34,318
Just to get off
on watching him die.

00:20:34,385 --> 00:20:38,022
They're both conniving,
diseased, camel-hooved 'ores.

00:20:38,088 --> 00:20:39,023
"Ore..."?

00:20:39,089 --> 00:20:41,058
Whores.
"Whores."

00:20:42,493 --> 00:20:44,862
(footfalls approaching)

00:20:49,199 --> 00:20:51,135
Well, it's cozy...

00:20:51,201 --> 00:20:53,203
for a morgue.

00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:55,572
What do you have
for me, Wendy?

00:20:55,639 --> 00:20:59,309
I got the results from the staff
of Holy Steven.

00:20:59,376 --> 00:21:00,778
Um, I recovered epithelials
on the handle,

00:21:00,844 --> 00:21:02,246
in the normal grip positions.

00:21:02,312 --> 00:21:03,747
And all the DNA was either

00:21:03,814 --> 00:21:06,717
from Steven himself
or from his disciple, George.

00:21:06,784 --> 00:21:08,385
What about the business end?

00:21:08,452 --> 00:21:10,321
Nothing, actually.

00:21:10,387 --> 00:21:11,789
That's what's weird--
there was no blood

00:21:11,855 --> 00:21:13,524
from the victim, no epithelials

00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:16,560
so honestly, I don't think
he used that to whack him.

00:21:16,627 --> 00:21:18,362
Why would he confess to killing
Steven with it?

00:21:18,429 --> 00:21:19,730
I don't know.

00:21:19,797 --> 00:21:22,399
I want to show you something.
Okay.

00:21:22,466 --> 00:21:26,303
Take a look at this.

00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:28,605
The Gospel according to Steven.

00:21:28,672 --> 00:21:30,574
Greetings, siblings.

00:21:30,641 --> 00:21:33,811
Today we learn the lesson
of the barista

00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:38,615
who taught me-- Steven--
this lesson.

00:21:38,682 --> 00:21:42,886
I did not want whipped cream on
my half-caf venti mocha latte.

00:21:42,953 --> 00:21:45,489
But when it arrived so
and I mentioned it,

00:21:45,556 --> 00:21:51,195
the barista said,
"Dude, we're slammed here.

00:21:51,261 --> 00:21:54,465
Can't you just spoon it out?"

00:21:54,531 --> 00:21:59,603
And I realized I could,
and I did.

00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:01,472
And thus, I freed myself

00:22:01,538 --> 00:22:04,241
of the conflict
that would afflict

00:22:04,308 --> 00:22:06,777
all the other
good people in line.

00:22:06,844 --> 00:22:09,313
So remember, siblings,

00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,682
in all things,

00:22:11,749 --> 00:22:18,322
be supple of thought
and pliant of deed...

00:22:18,389 --> 00:22:19,990
The central tenets
of this faith

00:22:20,057 --> 00:22:22,059
seem to be based on the
concept of acquiescence.

00:22:22,126 --> 00:22:24,762
Well, I suppose there are worse
things to base a religion on.

00:22:24,828 --> 00:22:26,764
I suppose so.

00:22:29,366 --> 00:22:31,368
You don't think he did it.
No.

00:22:31,435 --> 00:22:34,772
But I think the power of Steven
may have compelled him.

00:22:34,838 --> 00:22:36,073
BRASS:
So according to this,

00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,841
you said that you struck
The Steven

00:22:37,908 --> 00:22:39,910
with his staff.

00:22:39,977 --> 00:22:41,245
You smote him.

00:22:47,051 --> 00:22:48,719
That isn't true,
is it?

00:22:48,786 --> 00:22:50,287
Yeah... no.

00:22:51,622 --> 00:22:54,291
What did you hit him with?

00:22:56,293 --> 00:22:58,062
Oh, it says here a large rock.

00:22:58,128 --> 00:23:00,364
Yes.
No, wait a minute,
a branch of a tree.

00:23:00,431 --> 00:23:02,266
Yes.
No, a hockey stick.

00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:03,434
Yes.

00:23:05,469 --> 00:23:07,971
You didn't really kill Steven,
did you?

00:23:08,038 --> 00:23:09,106
No.

00:23:09,173 --> 00:23:10,908
So why did you confess
to murder?

00:23:10,974 --> 00:23:13,444
Well, I try to live my life

00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:16,647
according to the 17th
Proclamation of The Steven.

00:23:16,714 --> 00:23:18,549
From his second sermon
at the Starbucks.

00:23:18,615 --> 00:23:19,750
Oh, I missed that one.

00:23:19,817 --> 00:23:21,218
"It is better
to be...

00:23:21,285 --> 00:23:24,121
agreeable than to be right."

00:23:24,188 --> 00:23:26,790
That's not religion,
that's marriage.

00:23:26,857 --> 00:23:28,258
(laughing)

00:23:28,325 --> 00:23:29,860
That's... very...

00:23:31,495 --> 00:23:33,564
So you didn't kill Steven?

00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:34,898
Yes... no.

00:23:34,965 --> 00:23:36,600
You did?
Yes.

00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:37,501
You killed him?
No.

00:23:37,568 --> 00:23:39,036
Are you
clinically insane

00:23:39,103 --> 00:23:40,404
or just incredibly
annoying?

00:23:40,471 --> 00:23:41,839
What would you prefer?

00:23:41,905 --> 00:23:43,974
(sighs)

00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:48,345
Look, would you mind submitting
to a psychological evaluation?

00:23:48,412 --> 00:23:49,580
No.

00:23:49,646 --> 00:23:51,115
I don't even know why I asked.

00:23:51,181 --> 00:23:54,618
WILLOWS:
<i>So in other words, he's crazy?</i>

00:23:54,685 --> 00:23:56,086
Or crazy like a fox,

00:23:56,153 --> 00:23:57,821
or there was evidence
of someone else

00:23:57,888 --> 00:23:59,890
at the scene and I
didn't find it.

00:23:59,957 --> 00:24:02,326
Well, you've got
no murder weapon

00:24:02,393 --> 00:24:04,094
and no other suspects.

00:24:04,161 --> 00:24:05,529
I mean, maybe your vic

00:24:05,596 --> 00:24:07,331
just fell over
and bumped his head.

00:24:07,398 --> 00:24:08,966
It's been known
to happen.

00:24:09,033 --> 00:24:11,802
I'm going over to PD to wait
for the DHS psychologist.

00:24:11,869 --> 00:24:14,405
I'll fill him in on
Agreeable George.
Okay.

00:24:14,471 --> 00:24:15,973
Hey, Catherine.
Yeah?

00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,342
I just caught a double
420 in Seven Hills.
Oh!

00:24:18,409 --> 00:24:19,843
You interested?

00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:21,478
Let's do it.
All right.

00:24:21,545 --> 00:24:23,714
(siren chirps)

00:24:26,183 --> 00:24:27,818
Okay, we got two dead bodies.

00:24:27,885 --> 00:24:29,219
The wife discovered
the two victims

00:24:29,286 --> 00:24:31,422
when she returned from LA
from visiting her sister.

00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,589
Her name is Gretchen Javid.

00:24:32,656 --> 00:24:34,058
Oh, you're not listening to me.

00:24:34,124 --> 00:24:36,360
I am telling you, my husband
was never without his bodyguard!

00:24:36,427 --> 00:24:38,262
Please, please.
Hold her.
Sir, my husband was never

00:24:38,329 --> 00:24:39,730
without his bodyguard!

00:24:39,797 --> 00:24:41,398
And his bodyguard is missing!

00:24:41,465 --> 00:24:42,766
Please, somebody
help her out.

00:24:42,833 --> 00:24:44,034
Get her some medication.

00:24:44,101 --> 00:24:45,436
You need to stay calm, ma'am.

00:24:45,502 --> 00:24:47,504
I'm having an anxiety attack.
Help me, please.

00:24:47,571 --> 00:24:50,908
Officer Akers, uh, was the first
respondent on the scene.

00:24:50,974 --> 00:24:53,911
(indistinct radio transmission)

00:24:53,977 --> 00:24:56,180
Okay... so...

00:24:56,246 --> 00:24:59,316
victim number one
is Ismail Javid.

00:24:59,383 --> 00:25:01,018
He's the owner of the house.

00:25:01,085 --> 00:25:03,954
And victim number two
is his business partner,

00:25:04,021 --> 00:25:05,022
Allen McKenna.

00:25:05,089 --> 00:25:06,690
Now, they own a
company called

00:25:06,757 --> 00:25:09,426
Isfahan Marble &amp;amp; Tile.

00:25:09,493 --> 00:25:11,962
They did the new lobby
at the Marrakesh.

00:25:12,029 --> 00:25:13,063
I've seen it.

00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:14,531
It's grotesque.

00:25:14,598 --> 00:25:16,266
This is worse.

00:25:19,797 --> 00:25:21,232
AKERS:
When I arrived,
I found no sign of forced entry.

00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:22,400
Nothing disturbed
in the house.

00:25:22,466 --> 00:25:23,568
No sign of a struggle.

00:25:23,634 --> 00:25:26,037
And they still had
their wallets, so robbery

00:25:26,103 --> 00:25:28,072
doesn't seem
to be... (gagging)

00:25:28,139 --> 00:25:29,407
Excuse me. Sorry.

00:25:29,473 --> 00:25:31,008
Must have been
something I ate.

00:25:31,075 --> 00:25:33,411
Uh, well, I don't need you
puking on my crime scene, Andy,

00:25:33,477 --> 00:25:34,712
so go ahead
and take off.

00:25:34,779 --> 00:25:36,480
I've got it covered here.
Thanks.

00:25:39,083 --> 00:25:40,218
Hey...

00:25:40,284 --> 00:25:42,386
I don't see any external
wounds or injuries,

00:25:42,453 --> 00:25:44,422
and they're just
coming out of rigor.

00:25:44,488 --> 00:25:47,725
So, they've probably been dead
since early last night.

00:25:47,792 --> 00:25:49,660
Maybe a little longer.

00:25:49,727 --> 00:25:52,129
Whatever killed them
looks like it hurt.

00:25:52,196 --> 00:25:53,464
Yeah, both their necks
are flushed.

00:25:53,531 --> 00:25:56,100
That's usually a characteristic
of heart attack.

00:25:56,167 --> 00:25:57,368
PHILLIPS:
Simultaneous coronary seizures?

00:25:57,435 --> 00:25:59,270
That's kind of unlikely,
don't you think?

00:25:59,337 --> 00:26:00,438
SANDERS:
Very.

00:26:03,007 --> 00:26:04,442
Maybe they were poisoned.

00:26:04,508 --> 00:26:05,910
I'll take that stuff to Tox.

00:26:07,979 --> 00:26:12,116
SIMMS:
<i>So I ran the DNA</i>
<i>from the female skydivers</i>

00:26:12,183 --> 00:26:14,318
against the sample
that you took from the, uh...

00:26:14,385 --> 00:26:15,786
Cutaway handle?
Yes, thank you.

00:26:15,853 --> 00:26:17,788
And anyway, neither one
of them was on it.

00:26:17,855 --> 00:26:20,625
In fact, the only DNA
that I did find was
from Pierre himself.

00:26:20,691 --> 00:26:21,792
Really?
Mm-hmm.

00:26:21,859 --> 00:26:23,060
(over phone):
Langston.

00:26:23,127 --> 00:26:25,730
Hey, yeah, Ray, um,
I'm just wondering

00:26:25,796 --> 00:26:27,698
when you're, uh... going to be
getting back here.

00:26:27,765 --> 00:26:29,433
'Cause, uh... callouts
are starting to pile up.

00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,369
Well, I'm all done here.

00:26:31,435 --> 00:26:34,272
I should be back at the lab
in 15, 20 minutes.

00:26:34,338 --> 00:26:36,407
WILLOWS:
Oh, perfect...
(Akers groans)

00:26:36,474 --> 00:26:37,909
Ray? Ray, what's going on?

00:26:37,975 --> 00:26:39,243
(cries out)

00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:41,379
WOMAN:
This is Dispatch.

00:26:41,445 --> 00:26:43,414
We need paramedics.

00:26:43,481 --> 00:26:44,582
I'll take care of him.

00:26:44,649 --> 00:26:47,652
(Akers gasping)
(onlookers murmuring)

00:26:51,556 --> 00:26:54,659
He was in coronary arrhythmia,
very close to full arrest.

00:26:54,725 --> 00:26:56,394
Is there a history
of heart disease?

00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,229
None.

00:26:58,296 --> 00:27:00,097
Hey, Andy.
How you feeling?

00:27:00,164 --> 00:27:01,966
Fine.

00:27:02,033 --> 00:27:04,468
Just get somebody to take these
wires off, and I'll go home.

00:27:04,535 --> 00:27:05,803
LANGSTON:
That's not going
to happen

00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:07,738
anytime soon, son.

00:27:07,805 --> 00:27:10,641
WILLOWS:
Andy, I need you
to walk me through

00:27:10,708 --> 00:27:12,977
exactly what you did

00:27:13,044 --> 00:27:15,680
when you reported
to the 420 in Seven Hills.

00:27:15,746 --> 00:27:17,215
I responded to the call.

00:27:17,281 --> 00:27:19,450
Arrived first,

00:27:19,517 --> 00:27:21,118
ahead of EMS.

00:27:21,185 --> 00:27:23,087
Wife met me at the door.

00:27:23,154 --> 00:27:24,989
Led me to the backyard.

00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:26,724
GRETCHEN:
Let me through! Let me through!

00:27:26,791 --> 00:27:30,628
<i>I checked the vics for pulse,</i>
<i>but they were gone.</i>

00:27:30,695 --> 00:27:33,731
<i>So I taped the scene off</i>

00:27:33,798 --> 00:27:37,201
<i>and I waited for you guys</i>
<i>to show up.</i>

00:27:37,268 --> 00:27:39,470
Were you wearing gloves?

00:27:39,537 --> 00:27:41,105
No.

00:27:41,172 --> 00:27:42,740
And there was no reason to.

00:27:42,807 --> 00:27:44,876
Wa-Was there?

00:27:48,779 --> 00:27:51,582
Something at the scene
induced heart attacks
in both my victims.

00:27:51,649 --> 00:27:53,451
I think Akers was
exposed to it, too.

00:27:53,517 --> 00:27:55,920
Think it came from something
they both touched?

00:27:55,987 --> 00:27:57,655
I do.
EMT:
Out of the way, please.

00:27:57,722 --> 00:27:59,724
EMT 2:
Clear the way, coming through!

00:28:02,393 --> 00:28:03,394
I am telling you...!

00:28:03,461 --> 00:28:05,663
I'm having an anxiety attack.
Help me, please.

00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:08,032
That was the
victim's wife.

00:28:08,099 --> 00:28:09,400
(phone beeping)

00:28:09,467 --> 00:28:10,768
(line rings)

00:28:10,835 --> 00:28:14,472
Jim, we need to quarantine
the crime scene in Seven Hills.

00:28:14,538 --> 00:28:16,540
I think there's a contact
toxin involved.

00:28:16,607 --> 00:28:18,809
Include the entire house
and adjacent yards.

00:28:18,876 --> 00:28:21,579
<i>And no one enters</i>
<i>without Hazmat.</i>

00:28:30,521 --> 00:28:32,990
♪ ♪

00:28:49,073 --> 00:28:51,576
(whirring)

00:28:55,646 --> 00:28:58,950
ANDREWS:
<i>So I found a very faint,</i>
<i>powdery trace</i>

00:28:59,016 --> 00:29:00,918
on all the surfaces
I examined.

00:29:00,985 --> 00:29:02,153
It's a digitoxin.

00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,688
A naturally occurring
organic compound.

00:29:03,754 --> 00:29:07,959
It's a cardiac glycoside.
Used in heart medication.

00:29:08,025 --> 00:29:10,027
Yeah, in small doses
it is beneficial

00:29:10,094 --> 00:29:12,697
to healthy heart function,
but in higher doses

00:29:12,763 --> 00:29:14,799
it causes arrhythmia, and
in extreme concentrations,

00:29:14,865 --> 00:29:18,603
such as those found in the
tissues of both vics, death.

00:29:18,669 --> 00:29:21,939
But fortunately, it becomes
inert fairly quickly.

00:29:22,006 --> 00:29:24,242
Okay, so that explains why
Officer Akers

00:29:24,308 --> 00:29:26,110
and Mrs. Javid
survived the exposure.

00:29:26,177 --> 00:29:27,411
We have to go back

00:29:27,478 --> 00:29:29,113
and check the yard.

00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:32,083
Is there a reagent that can
detect the digitoxin?

00:29:32,149 --> 00:29:34,919
Yeah, a diluted solution
of perchloric acid

00:29:34,986 --> 00:29:37,421
exposed to UV light
will induce fluorescence.

00:29:38,723 --> 00:29:40,524
Try saying that ten times fast.

00:29:44,829 --> 00:29:46,330
(spray hissing)

00:30:12,423 --> 00:30:13,791
(clicking)

00:30:33,017 --> 00:30:34,819
HODGES:
The glycosides
are completely contained

00:30:34,886 --> 00:30:36,788
within the backyard.

00:30:36,854 --> 00:30:39,190
WILLOWS:
What does that dispersal
pattern suggest to you?

00:30:39,257 --> 00:30:40,725
Well, that the house
was targeted

00:30:40,792 --> 00:30:43,127
and that the toxins
were dropped from above.

00:30:43,194 --> 00:30:45,430
Yeah, yeah,
that's what we think.

00:30:46,431 --> 00:30:49,300
Well... you had said
that the victims

00:30:49,367 --> 00:30:51,836
looked like they were
caught completely unaware.

00:30:51,903 --> 00:30:53,771
What kind of aircraft
can fly that low

00:30:53,838 --> 00:30:55,907
and that quiet
without them even noticing?

00:30:55,973 --> 00:30:57,809
SANDERS:
Way ahead of you, Hodges.

00:30:57,875 --> 00:30:59,210
Ultralights.

00:30:59,277 --> 00:31:00,645
They're extremely
maneuverable,

00:31:00,712 --> 00:31:02,380
and able to fly
very slow

00:31:02,447 --> 00:31:03,448
without stalling.

00:31:03,514 --> 00:31:04,983
If they used one of these,

00:31:05,049 --> 00:31:06,851
they conceivably could have

00:31:06,918 --> 00:31:08,453
gained altitude,
then cut the engine,

00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:10,221
and glided silently,

00:31:10,288 --> 00:31:11,923
very low across the yard.

00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:14,926
Then after the drop, the pilot
could have restarted the engine

00:31:14,993 --> 00:31:17,395
and... landed
just about anywhere.

00:31:17,462 --> 00:31:19,397
We know that the
TOD was sometime

00:31:19,464 --> 00:31:22,633
the night before last.

00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,635
Greg, get me a latitude

00:31:24,702 --> 00:31:26,404
and longitude
for the yard.

00:31:26,471 --> 00:31:27,772
I got an idea.

00:31:38,616 --> 00:31:40,485
JOHNSON:
Okay,

00:31:40,551 --> 00:31:42,987
I've got tracking data
from the tower at McCarran

00:31:43,054 --> 00:31:45,523
for overflight
of latitude...

00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:47,992
36-10-27,

00:31:48,059 --> 00:31:49,694
longitude 1-22-

00:31:49,761 --> 00:31:53,331
15-10 at 2238 hours
the day before yesterday.

00:31:53,398 --> 00:31:55,433
There's one ultralight
in the area.

00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,335
There's the house.
SANDERS:
And that's

00:31:57,402 --> 00:31:59,103
where the craft
dropped off radar

00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:02,140
when it descended
and dropped the digitoxin.

00:32:02,206 --> 00:32:04,942
I wonder how they knew
the vics would even be there.

00:32:05,009 --> 00:32:06,944
Bodyguard must have
tipped them off.

00:32:07,011 --> 00:32:12,350
Did the craft transponder
relay any registration info?

00:32:12,417 --> 00:32:14,218
(beeping)

00:32:14,285 --> 00:32:15,586
I'm not getting anything.

00:32:15,653 --> 00:32:16,688
Can you widen the view

00:32:16,754 --> 00:32:18,656
and show me
where they went?

00:32:29,801 --> 00:32:31,736
He headed towards
Denim Field.

00:32:31,803 --> 00:32:34,339
Also the apparent
point of origin.

00:32:34,405 --> 00:32:36,841
That must be
where he landed.

00:32:36,908 --> 00:32:39,210
JOHNSON:
Let's check
out the perspective view.

00:32:39,277 --> 00:32:40,712
Whoever was piloting it

00:32:40,778 --> 00:32:43,414
brought it in on this
ancillary runway.

00:32:43,481 --> 00:32:44,949
SANDERS:
Private airstrip.

00:32:45,016 --> 00:32:46,818
No security.

00:32:46,884 --> 00:32:48,453
WILLOWS:
Wait.

00:32:48,519 --> 00:32:49,320
Go back.

00:32:49,387 --> 00:32:51,089
There.

00:32:56,227 --> 00:32:57,161
Stokes.

00:32:57,228 --> 00:32:58,930
Hey, Nicky,

00:32:58,997 --> 00:33:01,833
I think your jumper case
just got tangled up in mine.

00:33:01,899 --> 00:33:03,901
(sirens wailing)

00:33:36,067 --> 00:33:39,237
(spray hissing)

00:34:04,696 --> 00:34:05,863
Hey, Pierre?

00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:07,165
<i>Ã§a va?</i>

00:34:07,231 --> 00:34:09,400
(speaks French)

00:34:09,467 --> 00:34:10,935
BRASS:
Bonjour, Max.

00:34:14,939 --> 00:34:16,874
How's the patient?

00:34:16,941 --> 00:34:20,478
They say maybe, uh,
he never walk again, huh?

00:34:20,545 --> 00:34:22,680
Never speak.

00:34:22,747 --> 00:34:24,582
Imagine.

00:34:26,784 --> 00:34:28,619
Ouch.
Oh...

00:34:28,686 --> 00:34:31,289
Can you hear me, Pierre?

00:34:31,356 --> 00:34:34,425
(beeping)

00:34:34,492 --> 00:34:35,693
COMPUTER VOICE:
Yes.

00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,428
Oh.

00:34:37,495 --> 00:34:39,163
Good.

00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:42,500
Look... I got
a problem,

00:34:42,567 --> 00:34:44,435
and I think maybe you two guys
can help me out.

00:34:44,502 --> 00:34:45,737
I already told you

00:34:45,803 --> 00:34:47,872
all that I know about
Pierre's accident.

00:34:47,939 --> 00:34:49,240
No, it's not about the accident.

00:34:49,307 --> 00:34:50,842
It's about the fact
that your glider

00:34:50,908 --> 00:34:53,044
was used in a poison dump
to kill a couple of guys

00:34:53,111 --> 00:34:54,278
the night before last.

00:34:54,345 --> 00:34:56,180
Hey, I'm sure I
have no idea what

00:34:56,247 --> 00:34:58,049
you are talking about.
Well, maybe not.

00:34:58,116 --> 00:35:02,086
But I bet Pierre might have
something to say about it.

00:35:02,153 --> 00:35:03,755
There is nothing to tell.

00:35:03,821 --> 00:35:05,123
Is that right, Pierre?

00:35:05,189 --> 00:35:07,959
'Cause I get the feeling
that you really want to tell us

00:35:08,026 --> 00:35:10,795
what happened,
in every detail. Right?

00:35:17,168 --> 00:35:18,836
COMPUTER VOICE:
Yes.

00:35:18,903 --> 00:35:21,739
Pierre, be very careful
what you say, my friend, huh?

00:35:21,806 --> 00:35:23,007
BRASS:
Yeah.

00:35:23,074 --> 00:35:24,475
Be very careful.

00:35:24,542 --> 00:35:26,077
Now, tell us
what happened,

00:35:26,144 --> 00:35:27,945
word by word.

00:35:28,012 --> 00:35:29,113
I don't care

00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:30,548
how long it takes; I can wait.

00:35:31,582 --> 00:35:33,651
COMPUTER VOICE:
Was night.

00:35:38,022 --> 00:35:40,291
Cell ring.

00:35:40,358 --> 00:35:41,726
Max.

00:35:43,361 --> 00:35:45,029
He want me to fly.

00:35:45,096 --> 00:35:47,265
Okay.

00:35:47,332 --> 00:35:48,866
Okay.

00:35:48,933 --> 00:35:50,435
There was a man,
a very bad man,

00:35:50,501 --> 00:35:51,703
he want me to fly him
at night.

00:35:51,769 --> 00:35:54,439
Uh-huh.
He say, uh, he
want to make

00:35:54,505 --> 00:35:55,707
aerial photography.

00:35:55,773 --> 00:35:58,676
He offer me $5,000,
but I did not believe him.

00:35:58,743 --> 00:36:01,612
I say no, I have no license
to fly at night.

00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:04,182
But then he get meaner--
he threaten to hurt my family.

00:36:04,248 --> 00:36:06,150
He knows my
children's name,

00:36:06,217 --> 00:36:07,885
where we live, <i>tout Ã§a.</i>

00:36:07,952 --> 00:36:09,520
So...

00:36:09,587 --> 00:36:12,490
I agree to, uh, meet
him at the airport.

00:36:12,557 --> 00:36:15,259
But I was so nervous,

00:36:15,326 --> 00:36:17,095
I got in car accident.

00:36:17,161 --> 00:36:18,663
(tires screeching,
metal crunching)

00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:21,599
(phone line ringing)
(grunting):
Pierre! Pick up, pick up!

00:36:21,666 --> 00:36:23,868
(laughter,
Pierre speaking French)

00:36:23,935 --> 00:36:26,604
(cell phone ringing,
music playing)

00:36:26,671 --> 00:36:28,139
Hello?

00:36:28,206 --> 00:36:29,640
Pierre!

00:36:29,707 --> 00:36:31,409
For the love of God, just meet
(horn honks)

00:36:31,476 --> 00:36:33,144
this guy at the airfield,
take him up

00:36:33,211 --> 00:36:36,247
in the ultralight,
follow directions,

00:36:36,314 --> 00:36:37,615
and don't ask any questions!

00:36:37,682 --> 00:36:38,816
I pay you

00:36:38,883 --> 00:36:41,753
$5,000.
I can do this for you,
my friend.

00:36:41,819 --> 00:36:43,488
<i>Merci.</i>
Yes, my friend.

00:36:43,554 --> 00:36:46,357
(speaking in French)

00:36:46,424 --> 00:36:47,492
Pierre...

00:36:47,558 --> 00:36:48,993
Pierre has business
to attend to.

00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:51,429
MAX:
<i>Pierre had no idea</i>

00:36:51,496 --> 00:36:52,930
<i>what was going on.</i>
Okay...

00:36:52,997 --> 00:36:54,165
He said take it down! Now!

00:36:54,232 --> 00:36:55,166
<i>D'accord!</i>

00:36:55,233 --> 00:36:57,268
(both laughing)

00:36:57,335 --> 00:36:59,237
Two million bucks
in the bank.

00:37:01,539 --> 00:37:02,674
Now...

00:37:05,076 --> 00:37:07,412
(chuckling)

00:37:07,478 --> 00:37:11,082
(spray hissing)

00:37:11,149 --> 00:37:13,518
Think, uh, it's
starting to rain?

00:37:13,584 --> 00:37:15,687
(coughing, choking)
<i>He knew...</i>

00:37:15,753 --> 00:37:18,122
<i>he had done something</i>
<i>terribly wrong.</i>

00:37:18,189 --> 00:37:19,891
(coughing and choking stop)

00:37:19,957 --> 00:37:21,526
He was very upset.

00:37:21,592 --> 00:37:23,628
But, uh, I told him
to calm himself.

00:37:23,695 --> 00:37:27,198
I told him, uh, we had to do
our jobs and, uh, keep silent.

00:37:27,265 --> 00:37:29,167
You realize this makes you
an accomplice.

00:37:29,233 --> 00:37:30,468
You know that, right?

00:37:30,535 --> 00:37:32,103
I understand.

00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:34,872
But I really had no idea
what was going to happen.

00:37:34,939 --> 00:37:36,374
Did one of the killers

00:37:36,441 --> 00:37:37,408
mess with your parachute?

00:37:37,475 --> 00:37:38,443
Did he tamper it

00:37:38,509 --> 00:37:39,610
in any way?

00:37:39,677 --> 00:37:41,813
COMPUTER VOICE:
No.

00:37:41,879 --> 00:37:44,482
It... was...

00:37:44,549 --> 00:37:46,584
me.

00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:51,155
Because you couldn't
bear what you'd done,

00:37:51,222 --> 00:37:53,458
and you decided
to kill yourself.

00:37:53,524 --> 00:37:54,892
Yes.
You didn't want

00:37:54,959 --> 00:37:56,761
to be thought of as a coward,

00:37:56,828 --> 00:37:58,329
so you...

00:37:58,396 --> 00:38:00,331
rigged your own chute to fail.

00:38:00,398 --> 00:38:04,168
But even that failed,
isn't that so?

00:38:04,235 --> 00:38:05,570
Yes.

00:38:05,636 --> 00:38:07,638
(sobbing)

00:38:07,705 --> 00:38:09,741
Max.

00:38:09,807 --> 00:38:11,442
I need a name.

00:38:11,509 --> 00:38:14,312
NEWSWOMAN:
<i>A professional bodyguard</i>


00:38:14,379 --> 00:38:18,650
and a second, unidentified man
were arrested early this morning


00:38:18,716 --> 00:38:21,986
for the alleged killing
of Ismail Javid


00:38:22,053 --> 00:38:25,323
and Allen McKenna, co-owners
of Isfahan Marble &amp;amp; Stone,


00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:26,924
just two days ago.


00:38:26,991 --> 00:38:28,926
There is speculation
that the second man,

00:38:28,993 --> 00:38:32,163
a Kurdish crop duster
who was reputedly obsessed

00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:34,298
with the movie
<i>North by Northwest,</i>

00:38:34,365 --> 00:38:37,101
was hired by the owner
of rival Iranian

00:38:37,168 --> 00:38:39,237
marble importers
to kill the men,

00:38:39,303 --> 00:38:42,106
possibly in a dispute
over contracts

00:38:42,173 --> 00:38:44,042
in the dwindling housing market.

00:38:44,108 --> 00:38:45,877
Authorities have declined
to make a statement

00:38:45,943 --> 00:38:47,845
at this time...
STOKES:
Well, there's a story

00:38:47,912 --> 00:38:49,147
for you.

00:38:49,213 --> 00:38:51,883
I think I'll sell it
to Holly-weird, get rich.

00:38:51,949 --> 00:38:55,720
(laughs):
I thought we had
a trade embargo on...

00:38:55,787 --> 00:38:58,790
Iranian imports.
We do, but those guys
just ship the product

00:38:58,856 --> 00:39:01,359
to a second neutral country
in the area,

00:39:01,426 --> 00:39:02,860
like the UAE, transship it here,

00:39:02,927 --> 00:39:04,829
resell it to themselves
at cost.

00:39:04,896 --> 00:39:07,131
It's technically legal,
and, uh,

00:39:07,198 --> 00:39:09,200
Commerce turns
a blind eye.

00:39:09,267 --> 00:39:11,102
SANDERS:
And then they kill
each other here

00:39:11,169 --> 00:39:13,137
over construction contracts.

00:39:13,871 --> 00:39:15,707
Those Persian dudes
are tough, man.

00:39:15,773 --> 00:39:17,241
Well, they were once an empire

00:39:17,308 --> 00:39:18,976
that stretched halfway
across the known world.

00:39:19,043 --> 00:39:21,346
The Greek playwright Aeschylus
wrote about

00:39:21,412 --> 00:39:24,716
the territorial ambitions of the
Persian Empire against Greece

00:39:24,782 --> 00:39:27,418
in his great cycle of tragedy
and war, <i>The Persians,</i>

00:39:27,485 --> 00:39:30,054
um, fifth century,

00:39:30,121 --> 00:39:31,889
B.C.

00:39:31,956 --> 00:39:35,193
I will definitely put that
on my reading list.

00:39:35,259 --> 00:39:36,194
Does anyone want

00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:38,029
to grab some
breakfast?
Yeah, yep.

00:39:38,096 --> 00:39:40,031
Why are you always
thinking about food?

00:39:40,098 --> 00:39:42,166
None of you has read Aeschylus?

00:39:42,233 --> 00:39:44,902
I've been meaning to.
Well, you should.

00:39:44,969 --> 00:39:46,938
He was a writer
of tremendous power,

00:39:47,005 --> 00:39:48,006
great beauty.

00:39:48,072 --> 00:39:49,240
His death was...

00:40:15,099 --> 00:40:19,504
LANGSTON:
<i>As an old man in 456 B.C.,</i>

00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:22,774
<i>Aeschylus, the great body</i>

00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:26,010

<i>for the last time...</i>

00:40:26,077 --> 00:40:27,478
<i>where he traveled to Sicily,</i>

00:40:27,545 --> 00:40:29,147
<i>seeking solitude</i>

00:40:29,213 --> 00:40:33,051
<i>in which to contemplate</i>

00:41:01,646 --> 00:41:03,147
(bird screeches)

00:41:03,214 --> 00:41:05,216
<i>Though he had</i>

00:41:05,283 --> 00:41:06,884

00:41:06,951 --> 00:41:09,087

<i>Darius and Xerxes,</i>

00:41:09,153 --> 00:41:10,388
<i>it was here,</i>

00:41:10,455 --> 00:41:13,891
<i>in silent meditation,</i>
<i>that a beautiful act</i>

00:41:13,958 --> 00:41:16,995
<i>of a most violent nature</i>
<i>brought him</i>

00:41:17,061 --> 00:41:18,796
<i>to Elysium...</i>

00:41:18,863 --> 00:41:20,264
(clack)

00:41:20,331 --> 00:41:22,900
...and eternal paradise.

00:41:22,967 --> 00:41:24,902
Are you really gonna put that
in your report?

00:41:24,969 --> 00:41:27,739
Birds of prey drop
shelled animals onto boulders

00:41:27,805 --> 00:41:29,307
to get at the meat.

00:41:29,374 --> 00:41:31,142
Now, from the air,
Holy Steven's head

00:41:31,209 --> 00:41:33,378
must have looked like
just another rock.

00:41:35,413 --> 00:41:37,482
You can Google it
if you don't believe me.

00:41:37,548 --> 00:41:39,317
The DNA on the shell
was a match.

00:41:39,384 --> 00:41:41,352
What are the odds, right?
Before it happened,

00:41:41,419 --> 00:41:43,321
I would have said slim,

00:41:43,388 --> 00:41:45,590
but since it did happen,
a hundred percent.

WILLOWS:

00:41:47,659 --> 00:41:49,327
