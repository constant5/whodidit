00:00:26,255 --> 00:00:28,357
Is that the expanded
tox report?

00:00:28,424 --> 00:00:30,059
Yes, it is.

00:00:31,594 --> 00:00:33,830
Searched 600 metabolites

00:00:33,896 --> 00:00:35,832
and nothing unusual.

00:00:35,898 --> 00:00:38,000
Makes Mr. Kelly our third
undetermined in three weeks.

00:00:38,067 --> 00:00:40,303
ROBBINS:
Chief coroner's
gonna be on my butt.

00:00:40,369 --> 00:00:41,571
Conduct a review,

00:00:41,637 --> 00:00:43,206
cut the budget.

00:00:43,272 --> 00:00:44,774
I was at the scene.

00:00:44,841 --> 00:00:46,876
Pretty standard:
mother came home,

00:00:46,943 --> 00:00:49,412
found him convulsing, tried CPR.

00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:51,581
ROBBINS:
No prior history of seizures,
only trace amounts

00:00:51,647 --> 00:00:54,550
of meth in his system,
not enough to kill him.

00:00:54,617 --> 00:00:57,720
Put him in the meat locker
next to the other two.

00:00:57,787 --> 00:00:59,555
I'm gonna figure this out.

00:01:06,195 --> 00:01:08,431
I'm doing you
a solid here, Doc.

00:01:08,498 --> 00:01:10,233
Technically,
I can't investigate

00:01:10,299 --> 00:01:14,103
until you rule Mr. Kelly's
death either a homicide
or suspicious circs.

00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:16,205
I'll give you
my tickets to <i>Love.</i>

00:01:16,272 --> 00:01:18,207
I've seen it, twice.

00:01:18,274 --> 00:01:20,676
All right.
(phone ringing)

00:01:22,178 --> 00:01:24,881
I've got a call--
I'll meet you up there.

00:01:24,947 --> 00:01:27,850
All right!

00:01:27,917 --> 00:01:30,153
(thunder rumbling)

00:01:41,831 --> 00:01:43,433
Okay. Sure.

00:01:43,499 --> 00:01:45,101
Mrs. Kelly, this is
Catherine Willows
Yeah...

00:01:45,168 --> 00:01:46,636
from the Crime Lab!

00:01:46,702 --> 00:01:48,704
We spoke earlier!

00:01:50,173 --> 00:01:51,307
(knocks)

00:01:51,374 --> 00:01:53,109
(door creaks)

00:01:53,176 --> 00:01:54,710
Mrs. Kelly?

00:01:54,777 --> 00:01:56,145
Yeah?

00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,117
Mrs. Kelly, I'm, uh, Catherine
Willows from the Crime Lab.

00:02:02,985 --> 00:02:03,920
I left you a message.

00:02:03,986 --> 00:02:04,954
(groans)

00:02:10,693 --> 00:02:13,629
(crazed grunting)

00:02:15,531 --> 00:02:17,366
(both grunting)

00:02:29,345 --> 00:02:30,680
Catherine!

00:02:33,182 --> 00:02:34,217
(grunting)

00:02:35,551 --> 00:02:38,121
Catherine!

00:02:38,187 --> 00:02:39,522
(both grunting)

00:02:39,589 --> 00:02:42,525
(screaming)

00:02:46,729 --> 00:02:47,697
(sighs)

00:02:47,764 --> 00:02:49,232
(panting)

00:02:49,298 --> 00:02:50,900
ROBBINS:
Catherine!

00:02:50,967 --> 00:02:52,668
(pounding on door)
Are you okay?!

00:02:55,371 --> 00:02:57,407
Thank God.

00:02:57,473 --> 00:02:59,208
She jumped me.

00:02:59,275 --> 00:03:00,209
I pulled my gun

00:03:00,276 --> 00:03:03,913
and she just collapsed.

00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,248
(sighs)

00:03:08,418 --> 00:03:12,221
She's dead... and
you're bleeding.

00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:16,426

than the other way around.

BRASS:
So I talked
to the neighbors.


00:03:53,034 --> 00:03:55,069
Nobody had anything bad
to say about Mrs. Kelly.


00:03:55,136 --> 00:03:56,837
In fact,
they all called her a saint.


00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:59,640
She's a special ed teacher;
she's a friend to kids,


00:03:59,707 --> 00:04:01,709
stray dogs,
and anybody with a problem.


00:04:01,776 --> 00:04:03,444
Well, I must have
met her evil clone.


00:04:03,511 --> 00:04:04,745
BRASS: You know,
there's a reason
there's a protocol.


00:04:04,812 --> 00:04:06,614
You should have called me first.


00:04:06,681 --> 00:04:08,482
I was doing this
as a favor to Doc.


00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:10,051
Yeah, this thing
could have escalated easily


00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:11,986
and got out of hand.


00:04:12,053 --> 00:04:13,354
Next time, you call me.


00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:15,556
Yes, you're right.


00:04:15,623 --> 00:04:17,258
I'm glad you're okay.


00:04:17,325 --> 00:04:19,260
(sighs)
Thank you.


00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,461
How is she?


00:04:20,528 --> 00:04:21,963
Vitals are stable,
but the attacker bit her,


00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:24,131
and she's not sure when she had
her last tetanus shot.


00:04:24,198 --> 00:04:25,433
Let me see.


00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:27,568
I just called you so that
you could work the case


00:04:27,635 --> 00:04:28,569
'cause I'm a witness.


00:04:28,636 --> 00:04:29,604
Nick's already inside.


00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,739
Catherine, don't be a tough guy.


00:04:31,806 --> 00:04:33,474
Jeff, get her
to the hospital.


00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:34,775
Yes, sir.


00:04:45,052 --> 00:04:46,988
Evening, Professor.


00:04:47,054 --> 00:04:49,156
Nick.


00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:05,806
"Extending deep and heartfelt
sympathies in the death


00:05:05,873 --> 00:05:07,842
of your son Brent."


00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:10,678
Darla Kelly's son
died six days ago.


00:05:10,745 --> 00:05:13,347
Thinking that's probably
what drove her over the edge.


00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:29,063
(camera clicking, whirring)


00:06:10,104 --> 00:06:12,907
Hey, check it out.


00:06:12,974 --> 00:06:15,910
Found a baggy of meth
in Brent's dresser


00:06:15,977 --> 00:06:17,578
and an empty one
in the trash can.


00:06:17,645 --> 00:06:18,879
Hmm.


00:06:18,946 --> 00:06:22,650
Looks like he was a tweaker
living in Mama's trailer.


00:06:22,717 --> 00:06:27,855
Meth can make you stronger,
meaner, angry, paranoid.


00:06:27,922 --> 00:06:31,092
Maybe she was using,
too, which would explain


00:06:31,158 --> 00:06:33,694
her behavior.


00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:39,467
(indistinct conversation,
birds twittering)


00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:40,468
Hey.


00:06:40,534 --> 00:06:41,969
I found her alive
but unconscious.


00:06:42,036 --> 00:06:43,337
Possible sexual assault.


00:06:44,972 --> 00:06:46,407
Got an I.D.?
No purse,
no wallet.


00:06:46,474 --> 00:06:48,175
My guys are still
knocking on doors.


00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:51,145
Found her pants and shoes
next to the body,


00:06:51,212 --> 00:06:52,880
and the paramedics took
this off her.


00:06:52,947 --> 00:06:55,449
Who called it in?


00:06:55,516 --> 00:06:56,717
Uh, Mr. Murphy.


00:06:56,784 --> 00:06:57,885
Claims
that he found her


00:06:57,952 --> 00:06:59,086
lying under
his truck


00:06:59,153 --> 00:07:00,554
when he was leaving for work.


00:07:04,592 --> 00:07:06,360
His wife corroborated
his story.


00:07:06,427 --> 00:07:08,429
We'll see if
it holds up.


00:07:09,797 --> 00:07:11,732
Got some abrasions
on the back


00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:13,534
of the shirt.


00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:15,937
Couple of buttons missing
on the front.

00:07:22,944 --> 00:07:25,246
White substance
on the pants.

00:07:25,313 --> 00:07:27,782
Could be semen.

00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:29,450
Dried blood pool.

00:07:29,517 --> 00:07:31,419
She was probably out here
for a while.

00:07:31,485 --> 00:07:35,423
Some blood drops on the box--
mostly horizontal,

00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:37,625
more than eight inches
off the ground.

00:07:37,692 --> 00:07:39,961
Somebody hit her
when she was already down.

00:07:43,531 --> 00:07:46,000
Maybe she was kicked
under the truck.

00:07:53,174 --> 00:07:55,276
SANDERS:
Got a drag trail.

00:07:55,343 --> 00:07:57,812
See where it leads.

00:08:01,048 --> 00:08:02,416
(cracking)

00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:35,850
(crackling)

00:08:41,255 --> 00:08:43,257
Mrs. Kelly was such a nice lady.

00:08:43,324 --> 00:08:44,592
She lost her health insurance

00:08:44,659 --> 00:08:46,394
when she went part-time
at Marshall Creek Elementary.

00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,963
Poor thing was
always getting sick.

00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,364
The warrant includes
her son.

00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,799
Was he a patient here
as well?

00:08:51,866 --> 00:08:52,800
Brent?
Mm-hmm.

00:08:52,867 --> 00:08:54,368
Yeah, he came in a few times,

00:08:54,435 --> 00:08:55,836
feigning a back injury.

00:08:55,903 --> 00:08:57,705
Why is that, you think?

00:08:57,772 --> 00:08:59,340
He was trying to
score some oxycodone.

00:08:59,407 --> 00:09:00,508
Mm.
A couple weeks ago,

00:09:00,574 --> 00:09:02,410
Dr. Shaw had to
forcibly remove him.

00:09:02,476 --> 00:09:03,411
Really?

00:09:03,477 --> 00:09:04,979
I have his file, too.

00:09:05,046 --> 00:09:05,980
He was

00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:09,250
a terrible human being.

00:09:09,317 --> 00:09:10,584
I used to
suspect

00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:12,453
that he was abusing his mother,

00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,056
but when I asked Mrs. Kelly
about it, she clammed right up.

00:09:15,122 --> 00:09:19,493
It says here that Mrs. Kelly
called the clinic three days ago

00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,595
complaining
of flu-like symptoms,

00:09:21,662 --> 00:09:22,596
and someone told her

00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:23,998
to take an analgesic
and get some rest.

00:09:24,065 --> 00:09:25,199
Does that sound right?

00:09:25,266 --> 00:09:27,101
Do you think that contributed
to her death?

00:09:27,168 --> 00:09:30,705
I don't know yet,
but I'm gonna find out.

Robert Johnson.

00:09:51,692 --> 00:09:55,062
Recorded Friday, November 27,
1936, San Antonio, Texas.

00:09:55,129 --> 00:09:57,365
The Gunter Hotel, three blocks
from the Alamo.

00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:58,933
You're a blues man!

00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,601

record in Chicago

00:10:03,504 --> 00:10:05,206
at the M.E.s' convention.

00:10:05,273 --> 00:10:07,108
Guy let it go for 50 bucks.

00:10:07,174 --> 00:10:08,643
The man didn't
know what he had.

00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:09,644

Is that the tox report?

00:10:10,978 --> 00:10:11,979
Yes.

00:10:12,046 --> 00:10:13,014
No drugs in
her system.

00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,048
Henry ran the
panel twice.

00:10:14,115 --> 00:10:15,716
ROBBINS:
I don't get it.

00:10:15,783 --> 00:10:16,751

00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:18,686
this month.

00:10:18,753 --> 00:10:20,621
Mrs. Kelly lived
with her son.

00:10:20,688 --> 00:10:22,890
Maybe you're looking for
some kind of pathogen.

00:10:22,957 --> 00:10:24,058
Something infectious--

00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:27,161
a virus, bacteria,
microorganism?

00:10:27,228 --> 00:10:30,698
I've already ruled out
gonorrhea, viral hepatitis,

00:10:30,765 --> 00:10:33,935
syphilis, staphylococcus,
atypical pneumonia,

00:10:34,001 --> 00:10:38,072
meningitis, endocarditis,
influenza, West Nile, and SARS.

00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:39,907
Then it has
to be an exotic.

00:10:39,974 --> 00:10:41,442
Hmm.

00:10:41,509 --> 00:10:43,077
Did you hold the
rest of the bodies?

00:10:43,144 --> 00:10:45,146
Walk this way.

00:10:47,148 --> 00:10:49,483
Brent Kelly, 22,
died Friday night

00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:53,087
after an
unexplained seizure.

00:10:53,154 --> 00:10:54,355
Leeland Jacobs,

00:10:54,422 --> 00:10:58,326
33, ex-con, died alone
in his apartment,

00:10:58,392 --> 00:11:00,328
two weeks ago.
Says here he displayed

00:11:00,394 --> 00:11:03,364
aggressive behavior
prior to his death.

00:11:03,431 --> 00:11:05,633
Found cocaine in his system,
but he didn't OD.

00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,969
Depending upon
your genetic disposition,

00:11:08,035 --> 00:11:11,038
cocaine can trigger
schizophrenia and heart failure.

00:11:11,105 --> 00:11:12,506
It wasn't a heart failure.

00:11:12,573 --> 00:11:14,408
I can't tell you
if he was schizo.

00:11:14,475 --> 00:11:17,445
We couldn't find
any medical records.

00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:18,479
Scotty Belinsky.

00:11:18,546 --> 00:11:21,716
27. Died three weeks ago.

00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:23,017
Found in his bathroom.

00:11:23,084 --> 00:11:24,352
Another ex-con.

00:11:24,418 --> 00:11:27,955
I had Brass run backgrounds
on Belinsky and Jacobs.

00:11:28,022 --> 00:11:29,624
No apparent connections.

00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,392
Well, do we know
if either of them

00:11:31,459 --> 00:11:33,160
was connected to Brent Kelly?
No.

00:11:33,227 --> 00:11:36,330
The only thing that brings
these three men together

00:11:36,397 --> 00:11:37,598
is body modification.

00:11:37,665 --> 00:11:39,700
I see Mr. Kelly
had ear gauges.

00:11:39,767 --> 00:11:40,868
But you ain't seen nothing yet.

00:11:40,935 --> 00:11:43,237
Help me roll him.

00:11:47,108 --> 00:11:49,176
That is some
serious modification.

00:11:49,243 --> 00:11:51,178
Transdermal implants.

00:11:51,245 --> 00:11:53,914
It's done via a process
called "dermal punching."

00:11:53,981 --> 00:11:56,117
<i>Technician makes</i>
<i>an incision,</i>

00:11:56,183 --> 00:11:59,420
<i>separates subcutis and fascia</i>
<i>using a dermal elevator,</i>

00:11:59,487 --> 00:12:02,390
<i>creating a pocket</i>
<i>where an implant's inserted--</i>

00:12:02,456 --> 00:12:04,592
<i>typically steel</i>
<i>or silicone bead.</i>

00:12:04,659 --> 00:12:06,327
The skin fuses
around the bead,

00:12:06,394 --> 00:12:10,898
creating the design,
kind of like a Braille tattoo.

00:12:10,965 --> 00:12:12,600
So, maybe...

00:12:12,667 --> 00:12:15,569
all three of these men
visited the same tattoo parlor.

00:12:15,636 --> 00:12:18,205
Can't be many of them
that do this kind of work.

00:12:51,205 --> 00:12:52,206
(camera shutter clicking)

00:13:00,982 --> 00:13:02,850
(grunting)

00:13:02,917 --> 00:13:06,087
MAN: So, you want me to
take care of that?

00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:09,056
Hey, Lou, did you do a knock
and talk at this house?

00:13:09,123 --> 00:13:11,892
I'm just on my way
over there now.

00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:13,427
LVPD.
Yeah, uh...

00:13:13,494 --> 00:13:15,396
What's going on?
Ladies,

00:13:15,463 --> 00:13:17,498
I'm Detective Vartann.
This is Greg Sanders

00:13:17,565 --> 00:13:19,133
from the Crime Lab.

00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,735
A woman was attacked
on your street last night.

00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:22,903
We believe the victim might have
come from this house.

00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:25,072
Oh, my God. Kayla.

00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:26,774
She was here last night.

00:13:26,841 --> 00:13:28,643
Is, uh, this Kayla?

00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:32,480
Is she okay?

00:13:32,546 --> 00:13:33,948
She's in the hospital.

00:13:34,015 --> 00:13:35,916
What is Kayla's last name?

00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:37,084
Nootens.

00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,452
When was the last time
you saw her?

00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:39,620
Around 10:00.

00:13:39,687 --> 00:13:42,023
We had our diet club meeting,
me, Diana,

00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:43,257
and Kayla.
You know,

00:13:43,324 --> 00:13:46,093
we all entered
the GME bikini contest.

00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,928
GME?

00:13:47,995 --> 00:13:49,630
God Made 'Em.

00:13:49,697 --> 00:13:51,365
No fake boobs.

00:13:51,432 --> 00:13:53,601
First prize is

00:13:53,668 --> 00:13:55,036
a trip for two to Hawaii.

00:13:55,102 --> 00:13:56,604
Yeah. Well, we meet here
twice a week.

00:13:56,671 --> 00:13:57,972
We do our weigh in,
and then we have

00:13:58,039 --> 00:13:59,073
our support dinner.

00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,374
So, I lost another
two pounds.

00:14:00,441 --> 00:14:02,977
I was craving ice cream,
but I went for a run instead.

00:14:03,044 --> 00:14:05,146
And it worked.
Rub it in, why don't you?

00:14:05,212 --> 00:14:06,881
I lost zero pounds this week.

00:14:06,948 --> 00:14:08,549
I'm never going to fit
into my bikini.

00:14:08,616 --> 00:14:10,017
Don't say that.
We can do this.

00:14:10,084 --> 00:14:11,719
And I am going to go to Maui.

00:14:11,786 --> 00:14:12,620
DIANA:
If you win,

00:14:12,687 --> 00:14:13,721
will you take me?

00:14:16,057 --> 00:14:18,693
You said that Kayla left here
around 10:00?

00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:20,661
Did either of you walk her
to her car?

00:14:20,728 --> 00:14:22,496
I was going to drive her home,

00:14:22,563 --> 00:14:24,732
but then it stopped raining,
so she decided to walk.

00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:27,335
They say if you walk
after dinner,

00:14:27,401 --> 00:14:29,203
it burns more fat.

00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,705
Yeah.

00:14:30,771 --> 00:14:32,673
Um, do you know anyone

00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,408
who might want
to hurt her?

00:14:34,475 --> 00:14:35,576
Her ex...

00:14:35,643 --> 00:14:37,244
BF.
Yeah, they fought

00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,913
all the time.

00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,114
D-bag.

00:14:40,181 --> 00:14:41,882
He dumped her 'cause
she gained 15 pounds.

00:14:41,949 --> 00:14:44,151
And then he said that
he would take her back

00:14:44,218 --> 00:14:45,920
if she won the contest
and took him

00:14:45,987 --> 00:14:47,455
to Hawaii.
Do you know her

00:14:47,521 --> 00:14:48,289
ex-BF's name?

00:14:48,356 --> 00:14:51,359
Um, Elvis Rodriguez.

00:14:51,425 --> 00:14:54,362
(monitor beeping slowly)

00:14:57,498 --> 00:14:59,266
(Willows groans)

00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:02,436
The tetanus shot hurt more than
the crazy lady attacking me.

00:15:02,503 --> 00:15:04,939
You going to turn into
a vampire now?

00:15:05,006 --> 00:15:06,607
Well, I already
work nights,

00:15:06,674 --> 00:15:08,342
so I don't think anybody's
going to notice.

00:15:08,409 --> 00:15:09,377
(chuckles)

00:15:09,443 --> 00:15:11,279
I can't work the
other case,

00:15:11,345 --> 00:15:12,613
so fill me in here.

00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,548
Doctor says death is imminent.
Mmm.

00:15:14,615 --> 00:15:16,484
Wet mount was positive
for semen.

00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:18,986
And they found signs
of sexual trauma.

00:15:19,053 --> 00:15:20,655
Do you want to help me roll her?

00:15:25,059 --> 00:15:27,161
She's got road rash

00:15:27,228 --> 00:15:30,998
on her back, shoulders,
and buttocks.

00:15:31,065 --> 00:15:34,168
Based on the depth
of the abrasions,

00:15:34,235 --> 00:15:36,137
it looks like she was
dragged a long way.

00:15:36,203 --> 00:15:38,673
That's consistent with
what we found at the scene.

00:15:40,808 --> 00:15:45,279
Now, this neck injury
looks like a stab wound.

00:15:45,346 --> 00:15:47,014
You swab it?

00:15:47,081 --> 00:15:49,684
Nurse did. Found some trace
inside the wound track.

00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,385
It's with the SAE kit.

00:15:51,452 --> 00:15:53,721
(alarm beeping)

00:15:55,923 --> 00:15:57,458
(flatline tone,
staffers clamoring)

00:15:57,525 --> 00:15:59,026
Excuse me!

00:16:16,224 --> 00:16:17,159
(panting)

00:16:18,065 --> 00:16:19,725
STOKES:
He does know you can't undo that.

00:16:19,725 --> 00:16:21,660
Mmm.
Doesn't he?

00:16:21,727 --> 00:16:23,695
Self-mutilation
trips me out.

00:16:23,762 --> 00:16:25,931
LANGSTON:
It's a form
of rebellion.

00:16:25,998 --> 00:16:27,566
I've witnessed a couple of
botched tongue forkings

00:16:27,633 --> 00:16:28,800
in my time.

00:16:28,867 --> 00:16:30,502
STOKES:
Yeah, and even
if you make it through,

00:16:30,569 --> 00:16:31,536
you wind up with a...

00:16:31,603 --> 00:16:33,939
(slurring):
speech impediment.

00:16:34,006 --> 00:16:34,973
Hey, guys.

00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,108
Walk-ins always welcome.

00:16:36,174 --> 00:16:38,110
We're actually running
a special right now

00:16:38,176 --> 00:16:40,145
on matching
tattoo hearts.

00:16:40,212 --> 00:16:42,381
Or are you guys more
into rough trade?

00:16:42,447 --> 00:16:44,550
Dude, we're CSI.

00:16:44,616 --> 00:16:46,151
We're here
on police business.

00:16:47,953 --> 00:16:48,954
Are you the owner?

00:16:49,021 --> 00:16:50,289
I wish.

00:16:50,355 --> 00:16:53,292
It's Jack's Body Shop,
and my name is Eric.

00:16:53,358 --> 00:16:54,793
Eric Tobin.

00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,328
I'm the manager

00:16:56,395 --> 00:16:57,663
slash receptionist.

00:16:57,729 --> 00:16:59,865
The man-ceptionist.

00:17:01,133 --> 00:17:03,468
We need to speak with Jack.

00:17:03,535 --> 00:17:06,405
Jack is in the back making
one of his magic potions.

00:17:06,471 --> 00:17:08,707
Thank you, my man.

00:17:12,945 --> 00:17:14,713
(needle buzzing)

00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:18,450
Boy, this is all
kinds of wrong.

00:17:23,055 --> 00:17:24,823
(Stokes clears throat)

00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:27,659
Bathroom's in
the front.

00:17:27,726 --> 00:17:29,695
Are you Jack?

00:17:29,761 --> 00:17:31,863
Crime Lab boys.

00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:33,865
Dr. Jack Shaw.
What can I do for you,

00:17:33,932 --> 00:17:34,866
gentlemen?

00:17:34,933 --> 00:17:36,101
Are you the same Dr. Shaw

00:17:36,168 --> 00:17:37,936
that works the free clinic
on Janville?

00:17:38,003 --> 00:17:39,938
Guilty.

00:17:40,005 --> 00:17:42,407
I assume you also know
I'm a retired coroner from Reno.

00:17:42,474 --> 00:17:44,409
I do now.

00:17:44,476 --> 00:17:46,912
So, how'd you go
from being a coroner

00:17:46,979 --> 00:17:48,380
to owning this place?

00:17:48,447 --> 00:17:50,215
Natural transition, actually.

00:17:50,282 --> 00:17:52,150
Used to spend all day
cutting up dead bodies

00:17:52,217 --> 00:17:53,552
and sticking them with needles.

00:17:53,619 --> 00:17:55,053
Today when I cut 'em,
they bleed.

00:17:56,955 --> 00:17:58,957
Tell me, Doctor,

00:17:59,024 --> 00:18:01,126
do you know
if any of these men

00:18:01,193 --> 00:18:02,694
has been in your shop
recently?

00:18:02,761 --> 00:18:06,265
I don't recognize the faces,
but I do know the work.

00:18:06,331 --> 00:18:08,066
There's sunflower yellow

00:18:08,133 --> 00:18:09,534
and iris blue in these tats.

00:18:09,601 --> 00:18:11,536
That's "Van Gogh."
He mixes his own ink.

00:18:11,603 --> 00:18:13,372
And he's the only one
that does dermal implants.

00:18:13,438 --> 00:18:14,640
What's his real name?

00:18:14,706 --> 00:18:16,408
Carl Van Goe.
Spelled G-O-E.

00:18:16,475 --> 00:18:18,410
I swear to God.

00:18:18,477 --> 00:18:19,778
Had it legally changed.

00:18:19,845 --> 00:18:21,246
I fired him two weeks ago.

00:18:21,313 --> 00:18:22,281
How come?

00:18:22,347 --> 00:18:23,549
Artistic differences.

00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:25,050
Customer would want

00:18:25,117 --> 00:18:26,385
a certain design.

00:18:26,451 --> 00:18:28,587
Van Goe would give them
what he thought was right

00:18:28,654 --> 00:18:29,821
for their "canvas."

00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:36,028
You guys going to tell
me what's going on?

00:18:36,094 --> 00:18:39,298
These three men all died
of an infectious disease.

00:18:39,364 --> 00:18:41,300
Seems that this place--

00:18:41,366 --> 00:18:43,235
your shop-- is the only
common link.

00:18:43,302 --> 00:18:44,903
Hey, I run a clean shop.

00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:46,638
I give an antibiotic shot
to anybody

00:18:46,705 --> 00:18:48,674
that's had an invasive
procedure.

00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:51,510
But Van Goe brings his own tools
and needles.

00:18:51,577 --> 00:18:53,011
We'd like to check him out.

00:18:53,078 --> 00:18:55,781
In the meantime, we're going
to need your tools, needles,

00:18:55,847 --> 00:18:58,784
inks, and, uh,
the biohazard bin.

00:18:58,850 --> 00:18:59,985
Supply cabinet's
up front.

00:19:00,052 --> 00:19:01,019
Biohazard's out back.

00:19:01,086 --> 00:19:03,088
It's all in the
warrant.

00:19:05,023 --> 00:19:06,992
Uh, what pathogen
do you suspect?

00:19:07,059 --> 00:19:08,827
Did I say it was a pathogen?

00:19:08,894 --> 00:19:09,995
Retired coroner.

00:19:10,062 --> 00:19:11,230
I'm assuming.

00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,068
SANDERS:
So, Elvis, how'd you
get these injuries?

00:19:16,134 --> 00:19:17,436
I'm a landscaper.

00:19:17,502 --> 00:19:20,439
Got a lot of cactus orders
'cause of the drought.

00:19:20,505 --> 00:19:21,940
Or maybe
they're from

00:19:22,007 --> 00:19:23,942
when you raped your ex,
Kayla Nootens.

00:19:24,009 --> 00:19:25,277
I didn't rape Kay.

00:19:25,344 --> 00:19:26,712
We had sex.

00:19:26,778 --> 00:19:27,880
Open up.

00:19:27,946 --> 00:19:30,282
You had the kind of sex
where she said "no."

00:19:30,349 --> 00:19:31,316
Hold up. This is crazy.

00:19:31,383 --> 00:19:32,651
Me and Kay broke up.
Yeah.

00:19:32,718 --> 00:19:34,086
Because you thought she was fat.

00:19:34,152 --> 00:19:35,153
You ever seen her?

00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,188
She used to look like

00:19:36,255 --> 00:19:37,356
a little coke bottle.

00:19:37,422 --> 00:19:38,857
Then she got all messy
in the middle.

00:19:38,924 --> 00:19:40,225
I couldn't have that on my arm.

00:19:40,292 --> 00:19:42,461
So, when Kayla dropped a few
l.b.'s, you wanted her back?

00:19:42,527 --> 00:19:44,630
No, remember, he wanted
a free trip to Hawaii.

00:19:44,696 --> 00:19:46,565
Oh, right.
That's why I had sex with her.

00:19:46,632 --> 00:19:47,799
To seal the deal.

00:19:47,866 --> 00:19:48,901
She was easy that way.

00:19:48,967 --> 00:19:50,569
And I needed a vacay.

00:19:50,636 --> 00:19:51,904
What time was this?

00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:53,305
Around 6:00 maybe.

00:19:53,372 --> 00:19:54,806
Then she went to go see
some friends,

00:19:54,873 --> 00:19:57,643
and I had to go pick up my new
girlfriend's kid from day care.

00:19:57,709 --> 00:19:58,911
(sighs)

00:19:58,977 --> 00:20:00,479
VARTANN:
Where did you
go after?

00:20:00,546 --> 00:20:02,180
I dropped the kid off,
but my girlfriend was tired.

00:20:02,247 --> 00:20:03,515
So I went home.

00:20:03,582 --> 00:20:05,551
Well, that means
you don't have an alibi.

00:20:05,617 --> 00:20:07,052
Why do I need an alibi for?

00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:08,153
Because
I'm charging you

00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,689
with the rape and murder
of Kayla Nootens.

00:20:10,756 --> 00:20:12,925
Congratulations.

00:20:12,991 --> 00:20:15,627
You may have just won
a 20-year vacay.

00:20:20,933 --> 00:20:22,868
(beeps)
Hello, this is--

00:20:22,935 --> 00:20:24,870
Don't say "hello."

00:20:24,937 --> 00:20:26,805
(beeps)

00:20:26,872 --> 00:20:27,839
Okay.

00:20:27,906 --> 00:20:30,008
This is the first solo autopsy

00:20:30,075 --> 00:20:33,545
of Assistant Medical Examiner
David Gregory Phillips.

00:20:33,612 --> 00:20:35,581
Me.

00:20:35,647 --> 00:20:38,250
Decedent is a Caucasian female.

00:20:38,317 --> 00:20:39,718
Kayla Nootens.

00:20:39,785 --> 00:20:41,053
Early 20s.

00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:42,688
63 inches.

00:20:42,754 --> 00:20:44,756
144 pounds.
(beep)

00:20:52,464 --> 00:20:54,132
I don't have
C.O.D. yet,

00:20:54,199 --> 00:20:55,434
so please don't ask.

00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,902
You want some help?
No.

00:20:56,969 --> 00:20:58,237
I have to do
this myself.

00:20:58,303 --> 00:20:59,571
It's my first solo.

00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,975
Sorry.

00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:04,443
Didn't mean to lose my temper.

00:21:04,509 --> 00:21:06,478
That was you losing your temper?

00:21:06,545 --> 00:21:09,081
My wife calls me a
"snapping alligator."

00:21:10,215 --> 00:21:13,085
Well, your bad temper is
better than my good one.

00:21:13,151 --> 00:21:14,620
Did you examine
her neck wound?

00:21:14,686 --> 00:21:16,555
Of course I did.

00:21:16,622 --> 00:21:18,323
She was stabbed.

00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:19,791
I excised that
from the wound.

00:21:19,858 --> 00:21:21,593
What is it?
I have no idea.

00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,562
Maybe you could ask Hodges.

00:21:23,629 --> 00:21:25,631
(sighs)

00:21:27,366 --> 00:21:28,834
(groans)

00:21:28,901 --> 00:21:30,068
So, Mr. Van Goe,

00:21:30,135 --> 00:21:32,070
how come you still have
both your ears?

00:21:32,137 --> 00:21:33,171
Got the name

00:21:33,238 --> 00:21:34,907
'cause I cut off
someone's ear lobe.

00:21:34,973 --> 00:21:35,908
Accident.

00:21:35,974 --> 00:21:37,576
It was my first year on the job.

00:21:37,643 --> 00:21:38,911
Of course.

00:21:38,977 --> 00:21:41,313
So, where do you keep
all your tools?

00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,381
No, hey, hey, hey.

00:21:42,447 --> 00:21:43,448
Where do you think
you're going?

00:21:43,515 --> 00:21:44,650
Stuff's in there.
(chuckling): No.

00:21:44,716 --> 00:21:45,918
He'll go look.

00:21:45,984 --> 00:21:49,621
I need you to stay here
and paint me a picture.

00:21:51,456 --> 00:21:54,693
Did you do any work on these
guys at Jack's Body Shop?

00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,629
VAN GOE: I don't know.
Why don't you ask Jack? I quit.

00:21:57,696 --> 00:22:00,499
So, you telling me that
Shaw didn't fire you?

00:22:00,566 --> 00:22:02,668
He's a jackal and a philistine.

00:22:02,734 --> 00:22:05,170
I quit.
I took my clients with me.

00:22:05,237 --> 00:22:07,272
I'm going to need
a list of your clients.

00:22:07,339 --> 00:22:08,974
I don't write anything down.

00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:10,776
Excuse me, Mr. Van Goe.

00:22:10,842 --> 00:22:12,945
You been working out of
your shed these days?

00:22:13,011 --> 00:22:14,613
You do know that's

00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,181
against the law, don't you?

00:22:16,248 --> 00:22:17,149
Okay, let's start again.

00:22:17,216 --> 00:22:18,917
Did you work on
any of these guys?

00:22:18,984 --> 00:22:20,385
Either here, there, or anywhere?

00:22:20,452 --> 00:22:22,287
Maybe.
No,

00:22:22,354 --> 00:22:23,355
this is not multiple choice.

00:22:23,422 --> 00:22:24,556
It's either yes or no.

00:22:24,623 --> 00:22:26,291
Or.

00:22:26,358 --> 00:22:27,659
BRASS: Okay, it's gonna be
one of those days, I guess.

00:22:27,726 --> 00:22:28,660
All right, look,
Scotty, wrap him up.

00:22:28,727 --> 00:22:29,728
Come on, let's go.

00:22:29,795 --> 00:22:32,164
We'll do this
some other place.

00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,003
♪ Don't sit there mumblin' ♪

00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:40,038
♪ And talkin' trash ♪

00:22:40,105 --> 00:22:41,673
♪ If you wanna have a ball ♪

00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:44,576
♪ You gotta go out
and spend some cash ♪

00:22:44,643 --> 00:22:46,645
♪ Let the good times roll... ♪

00:22:46,712 --> 00:22:48,447
Damn it.

00:22:48,513 --> 00:22:52,317
Virology results
from the tattoo parlor.

00:22:52,384 --> 00:22:55,554
No detectable contaminants,
poisons or pathogens.

00:22:55,621 --> 00:22:57,823
Maybe something will turn up
in the Van Goe shed.

00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:59,892
Can we go over it one more time?

00:22:59,958 --> 00:23:01,059
Yeah.

00:23:01,126 --> 00:23:04,997
Starting with the
most recent victim.

00:23:05,063 --> 00:23:08,066
Darla Kelly gave her
dying son CPR.

00:23:08,133 --> 00:23:10,369
Three days later she
complains of a sore throat,

00:23:10,435 --> 00:23:12,004
fatigue and a low-grade fever.

00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,705
Three days after that,

00:23:13,772 --> 00:23:15,807
she attacks Catherine
and drops dead.

00:23:15,874 --> 00:23:17,175
Right, her counts are normal,

00:23:17,242 --> 00:23:18,443
white blood cells unaffected,

00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:20,012
which tells us
it's not bacterial.

00:23:20,078 --> 00:23:22,548
If it's not in the blood,
it has to be the tissue.

00:23:22,614 --> 00:23:23,916
Certain organisms
have different rates

00:23:23,982 --> 00:23:25,317
of crossing the
blood-brain barrier.

00:23:25,384 --> 00:23:27,619
Histology was negative.

00:23:27,686 --> 00:23:31,123
Muscle, tissue,
brain, organs.

00:23:31,189 --> 00:23:33,425
But the lab only checked
for common pathogens.

00:23:33,492 --> 00:23:37,262
Let's take a look at
Darla Kelly's brain tissue.

00:23:38,297 --> 00:23:40,232
LANGSTON:
Bottom right quadrant.

00:23:40,299 --> 00:23:41,800
Is that a Negri body?

00:23:41,867 --> 00:23:43,302
That's what I'm thinking.

00:23:43,368 --> 00:23:45,704
I haven't seen one of those
since medical school.

00:24:00,652 --> 00:24:02,354
I have another one
here, Doctor.

00:24:02,421 --> 00:24:05,924
There are Negri bodies in
each victim's brain tissue.

00:24:08,126 --> 00:24:09,428
It's rabies.
Yes.

00:24:09,494 --> 00:24:11,330
No one's died of
rabies in Nevada

00:24:11,396 --> 00:24:12,331
in over 90 years,

00:24:12,397 --> 00:24:14,333
and now we have four in a month.

00:24:14,399 --> 00:24:18,237
Rabies would explain Darla
Kelly's flu-like symptoms.

00:24:18,303 --> 00:24:20,138
It was raining
that night.

00:24:20,205 --> 00:24:22,641
Rabies can cause hydrophobia,
intense fear of water.

00:24:22,708 --> 00:24:25,043
Maybe it triggered
her violent behavior.

00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,712
And rabies is carried
in the saliva.

00:24:26,778 --> 00:24:28,714
Mrs. Kelly had a cold sore.

00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:31,316
ROBBINS:
<i>The virus travels through</i>

00:24:31,383 --> 00:24:33,252
<i>connective tissue</i>
<i>into the muscle,</i>

00:24:33,318 --> 00:24:36,321
<i>goes up into the neuronal</i>
<i>cells of the brain stem</i>

00:24:36,388 --> 00:24:38,557
<i>and into the limbic cortex.</i>

00:24:38,624 --> 00:24:41,193
The most common form of
rabies virus transmission

00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:44,029
is through the bite or
the virus-containing saliva

00:24:44,096 --> 00:24:47,766
of an infected host, which is
almost always a rabid animal.

00:24:47,833 --> 00:24:50,569
Now, none of the victims
had bite marks,

00:24:50,636 --> 00:24:52,271
and no one reported
being bitten.

00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:55,274
Someone was bitten.

00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:56,375
Catherine.

00:25:03,849 --> 00:25:05,551
What's wrong?

00:25:05,617 --> 00:25:08,120
Uh, we have C.O.D.
on Darla Kelly.

00:25:08,186 --> 00:25:09,354
It's rabies.

00:25:12,991 --> 00:25:15,594
Okay, uh, so, what?

00:25:15,661 --> 00:25:17,329
I'll get a shot and be fine.

00:25:17,396 --> 00:25:20,332
Human rabies cases
are very rare.

00:25:20,399 --> 00:25:22,401
The treatment is
extremely expensive,

00:25:22,467 --> 00:25:25,003
which is why the state
doesn't have any available.

00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:28,307
Okay, so, you're telling me

00:25:28,373 --> 00:25:29,608
that there aren't any
available shots

00:25:29,675 --> 00:25:30,943
in the entire state of Nevada?!

00:25:31,009 --> 00:25:32,377
If the treatment is administered

00:25:32,444 --> 00:25:34,246
within the first
72 hours of transmission,

00:25:34,313 --> 00:25:36,481
you should be fine.

00:25:36,548 --> 00:25:37,716
It's already been
more than 24.

00:25:37,783 --> 00:25:39,985
And we've located a supply;
it's in Atlanta.

00:25:40,052 --> 00:25:42,354
Atlanta?!
Georgia.

00:25:42,421 --> 00:25:43,555
You'll need a test

00:25:43,622 --> 00:25:44,790
to confirm whether
you've got it.

00:25:44,856 --> 00:25:47,793
And I'm taking you to
the hospital right now.

00:25:47,859 --> 00:25:50,462
I... I need to call Nick.

00:25:50,529 --> 00:25:51,630
Let him know he's the
acting supervisor.

00:25:51,697 --> 00:25:52,931
Use your cell phone.

00:26:09,545 --> 00:26:12,081
At least give me a hint.
I wish I could.

00:26:12,147 --> 00:26:15,050
But Dr. Robbins has to review
and sign off on my work first.

00:26:15,117 --> 00:26:16,385
Okay, well, where is he?

00:26:16,452 --> 00:26:17,453
The hospital.

00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,921
Visiting Catherine.

00:26:18,988 --> 00:26:21,790
He must be feeling
really guilty.

00:26:25,928 --> 00:26:27,730
Okay, the rape victim

00:26:27,796 --> 00:26:30,266
who was dragged.
Uh, Kayla Nootens.

00:26:30,332 --> 00:26:31,267
Go.

00:26:31,333 --> 00:26:32,434
Okay, uh, decedent sustained

00:26:32,501 --> 00:26:33,602
a half-inch deep stab wound

00:26:33,669 --> 00:26:36,105
to the right side
of her neck.

00:26:36,171 --> 00:26:38,340
It nicked her vertebral artery.

00:26:38,407 --> 00:26:40,709
C.O.D. is exsanguination.

00:26:40,776 --> 00:26:42,578
This wound is minor, David.

00:26:42,645 --> 00:26:43,946
She's a young woman.

00:26:44,013 --> 00:26:45,347
Blood would have
clotted within minutes.

00:26:45,414 --> 00:26:47,516
Yes, sir, however,

00:26:47,583 --> 00:26:49,618
I discovered that she
was severely anemic

00:26:49,685 --> 00:26:51,887
and had excessive levels
of caffeine in her system.

00:26:51,954 --> 00:26:53,789
Both of which contributed
to blood thinning

00:26:53,856 --> 00:26:55,457
and compromised
her clotting factors.

00:26:55,524 --> 00:26:57,826
Common indicators of anorexia.

00:26:57,893 --> 00:26:59,628
Or extreme dieting.

00:26:59,695 --> 00:27:02,965
Her and her friends
were trying to win
a bikini contest.

00:27:03,032 --> 00:27:05,668
So, my proposed C.O.D.
is exsanguination

00:27:05,734 --> 00:27:08,604
with additional complicating
factors preventing clotting.

00:27:10,105 --> 00:27:11,540
Well described.

00:27:11,607 --> 00:27:13,175
I concur.

00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:20,916
Catherine just got her
prophylaxis shots.

00:27:20,983 --> 00:27:22,351
She's doing fine.

00:27:22,418 --> 00:27:23,786
That's good to hear.

00:27:23,853 --> 00:27:25,421
What have you got?

00:27:25,487 --> 00:27:28,324
Well, virology confirmed
that all four victims died

00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:30,993
of a, uh, rabies virus
variant associated

00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:33,095
with T. Brasiliensis.

00:27:33,162 --> 00:27:35,164
The Mexican Free Tailed Bat.

00:27:35,231 --> 00:27:38,834
We didn't find any evidence of
bats at the mobile home park.

00:27:38,901 --> 00:27:41,770
And two of the victims died
in apartments off the strip.

00:27:41,837 --> 00:27:45,241
So, what's our theory?

00:27:45,307 --> 00:27:47,142
I mean, did all these
people go spelunking

00:27:47,209 --> 00:27:48,611
in Lehman Caves or what?

00:27:48,677 --> 00:27:50,346
They charge admission there.

00:27:50,412 --> 00:27:51,981
So, I checked their guest books

00:27:52,047 --> 00:27:53,249
and their receipts.

00:27:53,315 --> 00:27:54,416
None of our victims
were there.

00:27:54,483 --> 00:27:55,484
I called CDC,

00:27:55,551 --> 00:27:57,152
I asked for all their files

00:27:57,219 --> 00:27:58,454
on rabies transmissions.

00:27:58,521 --> 00:28:00,322
Most of it was,
uh, straight-up

00:28:00,389 --> 00:28:02,591
"hunter bitten by fox" stuff.

00:28:02,658 --> 00:28:04,760
But this one did stand out.

00:28:04,827 --> 00:28:06,328
STOKES:
That's redacted.

00:28:06,395 --> 00:28:08,063
That usually means
there was a lawsuit

00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:09,665
with a confidential settlement.

00:28:09,732 --> 00:28:11,834
Doc Robbins says there
hasn't been a rabies death

00:28:11,901 --> 00:28:13,736
in Nevada in nearly a century.

00:28:13,802 --> 00:28:15,237
But from what
I can piece together,

00:28:15,304 --> 00:28:16,872
that may not be true.

00:28:16,939 --> 00:28:18,307
A patient up in Reno
tested positive

00:28:18,374 --> 00:28:21,143
for rabies after
a liver transplant.

00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:23,145
But doesn't say
if she died or not.

00:28:23,212 --> 00:28:25,881
If her liver was infected,
she's dead.

00:28:25,948 --> 00:28:28,551
If the donor was local,
that means that the

00:28:28,617 --> 00:28:30,786
Reno Coroner had to
clear the body

00:28:30,853 --> 00:28:32,321
before they could
harvest the organs.

00:28:32,388 --> 00:28:35,057
I guess he must've
missed it.

00:28:35,124 --> 00:28:38,127
Yeah.

00:28:38,194 --> 00:28:39,528
What about Dr. Shaw?

00:28:39,595 --> 00:28:40,696
He's a coroner.

00:28:40,763 --> 00:28:43,032
I know this happened
three years ago.

00:28:43,098 --> 00:28:45,568
I don't know how many they
had working in Reno back then,

00:28:45,634 --> 00:28:47,670
but we do know him.

00:28:47,736 --> 00:28:50,072
Brent Kelly, Scott Belinsky
and Leeland Jacobs

00:28:50,139 --> 00:28:52,508
all went to this
guy's tattoo parlor.

00:28:52,575 --> 00:28:54,243
And both the Kellys
were treated by him

00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:56,078
at the Free Clinic.

00:28:56,145 --> 00:28:57,913
Your victim was a messy eater.

00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,915
Not too proficient with a fork.

00:28:59,982 --> 00:29:03,552
The white substance on
the clothes is not semen.

00:29:03,619 --> 00:29:06,722
It's potatoes, butter,
milk and a pinch of garlic.

00:29:06,789 --> 00:29:08,991
Mashed potatoes?
Mm-hmm.

00:29:09,058 --> 00:29:11,360
She was cheating on her diet.

00:29:11,427 --> 00:29:12,995
More like a food orgy.

00:29:13,062 --> 00:29:14,363
The trace on the neck wound

00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:15,731
showed apple, cinnamon

00:29:15,798 --> 00:29:17,399
and grease.

00:29:17,466 --> 00:29:19,401
What about the fragment
David extracted?

00:29:19,468 --> 00:29:21,570
Well, that would be
the main course.

00:29:21,637 --> 00:29:22,938
It was animal bone.

00:29:23,005 --> 00:29:25,040
Although it was too small
for me to identify the species,

00:29:25,107 --> 00:29:27,943
I think we know
it's pretty obvious.

00:29:29,345 --> 00:29:31,514
Babe.

00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,781
Wilbur?

00:29:33,816 --> 00:29:35,050
Pork.

00:29:35,117 --> 00:29:36,352
Yes, the other white meat.

00:29:36,418 --> 00:29:38,354
That's the only type
of flesh that you would

00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,421
season that way.

00:29:40,256 --> 00:29:42,224
Suddenly, I'm very hungry.

00:29:42,291 --> 00:29:43,392
Break time.

00:29:44,426 --> 00:29:46,061
Hold on there, spuds.

00:29:46,128 --> 00:29:48,430
How much do you weigh?

00:29:48,497 --> 00:29:49,965
Uh, excuse you.

00:29:50,032 --> 00:29:50,966
That's not public
information.

00:29:51,033 --> 00:29:54,537
I'd say a buck 45.

00:29:54,603 --> 00:29:56,438
Same as our victim.

00:29:56,505 --> 00:29:58,841
We know Kayla Nootens
was dragged face-up

00:29:58,908 --> 00:30:01,110
because her back
was abraded.

00:30:01,177 --> 00:30:03,779
So, if the killer

00:30:03,846 --> 00:30:06,815
(grunting with effort):
dragged her like this...

00:30:06,882 --> 00:30:07,950
Her back wouldn't be abraded.

00:30:08,017 --> 00:30:10,085
Right.
Okay, what if
the killer

00:30:10,152 --> 00:30:12,154
dragged her like this?

00:30:12,221 --> 00:30:13,989
Ow, hey!

00:30:14,056 --> 00:30:16,559
Easy, killer.

00:30:16,625 --> 00:30:18,460
Hodges' calves are
touching the floor.

00:30:18,527 --> 00:30:20,930
Vic had no abrasions
from the knees down.

00:30:20,996 --> 00:30:23,365
There must've been two of them.

00:30:28,504 --> 00:30:30,272
Yep.

00:30:30,339 --> 00:30:32,174
Elvis had a friend.

00:30:32,241 --> 00:30:36,111
Um... if I may...

00:30:36,178 --> 00:30:38,080
Wouldn't two men, one of whom

00:30:38,147 --> 00:30:41,317
being a cactus-hauling
desert landscaper,

00:30:41,383 --> 00:30:43,652
just be able to pick me up
and carry me?

00:30:43,719 --> 00:30:44,887
Or... her?

00:30:45,921 --> 00:30:48,324
First rule of diet club...

00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:50,192
Don't talk about diet club.

00:30:50,259 --> 00:30:51,594
The whole thing
was Rhonda's fault.

00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:52,962
She was sabotaging
Kayla's diet

00:30:53,028 --> 00:30:54,230
because she'd lost
the most weight.

00:30:54,296 --> 00:30:56,432
That is so not true!

00:30:56,498 --> 00:30:58,067
Kayla was fatter than me.

00:30:58,133 --> 00:31:00,302
So, of course she
lost more weight.

00:31:00,369 --> 00:31:03,172
Anyway, Kayla is
the one that started it.

00:31:03,239 --> 00:31:05,307
These mashed potatoes
are amazing.

00:31:05,374 --> 00:31:06,976
What kind of butter
substitute did you use?

00:31:07,042 --> 00:31:08,978
Mine suck.

00:31:09,044 --> 00:31:10,546
(Rhonda clearing throat)

00:31:14,283 --> 00:31:15,684
Hers are watery.

00:31:15,751 --> 00:31:17,486
Oh, my God.

00:31:17,553 --> 00:31:18,587
You bitch.

00:31:21,457 --> 00:31:24,260
You are the bitch!

00:31:24,326 --> 00:31:25,995
You were going to
ditch me for your

00:31:26,061 --> 00:31:28,297
ugly ex-BF and
take him to Hawaii!

00:31:28,364 --> 00:31:30,733
You're both bitches!

00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:31,834
(women screaming)

00:31:31,901 --> 00:31:33,102
Kayla would still
be alive if

00:31:33,168 --> 00:31:35,137
Rhonda hadn't whipped that
pork chop at her.

00:31:36,105 --> 00:31:39,475
(girls screaming)

00:31:44,346 --> 00:31:46,315
(gasping)

00:31:47,783 --> 00:31:49,351
You are going to jail!

00:31:49,418 --> 00:31:51,220
And you will always

00:31:51,287 --> 00:31:53,889
have a fat ass!

00:31:53,956 --> 00:31:56,091
<i>Rhonda lost it,</i>
<i>chased her down.</i>

00:31:58,194 --> 00:31:59,862
<i>She dropped dead right there.</i>

00:31:59,929 --> 00:32:02,364
I didn't know that you
could kill somebody

00:32:02,431 --> 00:32:03,732
with a pork chop.

00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:04,867
But it was
Diana's idea

00:32:04,934 --> 00:32:06,602
to drag the body under the truck

00:32:06,669 --> 00:32:08,304
and then pin the
whole thing on Elvis.

00:32:22,618 --> 00:32:25,120
Kayla wasn't dead
when you were

00:32:25,187 --> 00:32:27,089
kicking her
under the truck.

00:32:27,156 --> 00:32:29,325
She bled to death

00:32:29,391 --> 00:32:31,193
because you left her there.

00:32:38,634 --> 00:32:40,102
I'm telling you,
I didn't kill anybody.

00:32:40,169 --> 00:32:41,537
Okay, we got it,
Doc, let's go.

00:32:41,604 --> 00:32:42,671
Want me to call
your girlfriend?
Hey, hey, hey!

00:32:42,738 --> 00:32:43,806
Back off, back off.

00:32:43,873 --> 00:32:45,174
Hey, I got your back,
I believe you!

00:32:45,241 --> 00:32:47,276
Stay strong.

00:32:47,343 --> 00:32:49,211
Hey, take it easy.
(groans)

00:32:50,212 --> 00:32:51,647
Call 911.

00:32:53,182 --> 00:32:54,250
Hey, bud.

00:32:54,316 --> 00:32:55,718
Huh?
Hey, bud.

00:32:55,784 --> 00:32:56,952
Did I just pass out again?

00:32:57,019 --> 00:32:58,954
Stay, stay back.

00:32:59,021 --> 00:33:00,122
How you feeling?

00:33:00,189 --> 00:33:01,524
I'm fine.

00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:03,192
I just... I haven't
been feeling too good

00:33:03,259 --> 00:33:04,527
since I got my nipples pierced.

00:33:05,995 --> 00:33:07,630
Dr. Shaw gave me a shot
of antibiotics,

00:33:07,696 --> 00:33:09,198
but I probably just got
an infection anyway.

00:33:09,265 --> 00:33:10,833
When did you get the shot?

00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,468
A couple days ago.

00:33:22,753 --> 00:33:24,021
I don't know-- it's a setup.

00:33:24,088 --> 00:33:25,422
I'm being framed.
BRASS:
Who framed you?

00:33:25,489 --> 00:33:27,791
Roger Rabbit?
Maybe Van Goe.

00:33:27,858 --> 00:33:28,792
He's a crazy bastard.

00:33:28,859 --> 00:33:30,227
He threatened me
when I fired him.

00:33:30,294 --> 00:33:31,929
So, how does this
frame-up play out?

00:33:31,996 --> 00:33:33,230
Van Goe breaks
into your shop

00:33:33,297 --> 00:33:34,899
wearing a
Dr. Shaw mask

00:33:34,965 --> 00:33:36,667
and pokes Tobin
with a rabid needle?

00:33:36,734 --> 00:33:38,903
I'm not denying I gave Eric
an antibiotic shot.

00:33:38,969 --> 00:33:41,171
He had a piercing--
that's SOP at my shop.

00:33:41,238 --> 00:33:43,073
You know, somebody's lying
in this room.

00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,808
And it's not me,
and it's not him,

00:33:44,875 --> 00:33:46,610
'cause he just
got here.

00:33:50,748 --> 00:33:52,816
Three years ago,
in Reno,

00:33:52,883 --> 00:33:55,419
a transplant recipient died
from a donor liver

00:33:55,486 --> 00:33:57,254
that tested positive for rabies.

00:33:57,321 --> 00:33:59,123
SHAW:
I was the M.E.

00:33:59,189 --> 00:34:00,190
on the donor's autopsy.

00:34:00,257 --> 00:34:01,458
I ruled it a natural.

00:34:01,525 --> 00:34:02,593
There was an
investigation.

00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,861
I was cleared.

00:34:03,928 --> 00:34:06,297
Rabies detection is not part
of the organ review.

00:34:06,363 --> 00:34:07,531
So, this isn't

00:34:07,598 --> 00:34:09,033
your first dance
around the rabies game.

00:34:09,099 --> 00:34:11,001
Did you give the donor
an antibiotic shot, too?

00:34:11,068 --> 00:34:13,637
The victim's family
later admitted

00:34:13,704 --> 00:34:15,673
that he had been bitten
by a raccoon

00:34:15,739 --> 00:34:17,174
six weeks before he died.

00:34:17,241 --> 00:34:20,477
Well, maybe Rocky Raccoon
framed you.

00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:23,714
I'd like to end this interview
and call a lawyer.

STOKES:
Miss Schiff?

00:35:02,253 --> 00:35:03,220
Hi.
Hi.

00:35:03,287 --> 00:35:04,488
Can I help you
with something?

00:35:04,555 --> 00:35:06,390
Uh, no, but I think
I can help you.

00:35:06,457 --> 00:35:08,759
I found this in the trash
at Dr. Shaw's house.

00:35:08,826 --> 00:35:11,095
What were you doing
at his house?

00:35:11,161 --> 00:35:12,696
Mr. Stokes, I'm...

00:35:12,763 --> 00:35:15,232
embarrassed to admit it,
but we were dating.

00:35:15,299 --> 00:35:17,101
I-I didn't see it.

00:35:17,167 --> 00:35:20,070
I had no idea that
he's this monster.

00:35:20,137 --> 00:35:21,839
I saw him take it out
of his briefcase.

00:35:21,906 --> 00:35:23,807
These are the same bags
we use at the clinic.

00:35:23,874 --> 00:35:25,376
I don't think it belongs
to a patient.

00:35:25,442 --> 00:35:26,677
Did you ask him about it?

00:35:26,744 --> 00:35:29,613
He gets angry
if I ask him any questions.

00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,814
Just please
don't tell him

00:35:30,881 --> 00:35:32,750
that I gave it to you.

00:35:32,816 --> 00:35:34,552
All right.

00:35:34,618 --> 00:35:36,987
Thanks.

00:35:38,722 --> 00:35:39,957
(clears throat) Hi.

00:35:40,024 --> 00:35:41,659
I need to know
what this is,

00:35:41,725 --> 00:35:43,727
and then get the bag
to Prints right away.

00:35:43,794 --> 00:35:44,929
Well, it looks
like it's

00:35:44,995 --> 00:35:46,096
some kind of tissue.

00:35:46,163 --> 00:35:48,299
Yeah, you might want
to double-glove.

00:35:48,365 --> 00:35:50,568
I think Dr. Shaw's been
cutting up rabid animals,

00:35:50,634 --> 00:35:53,170
making some sort
of a rabies potion.

00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:58,542
I will sample DNA
and run a species determination.

00:35:58,609 --> 00:36:00,210
Also, I found
Eric Tobin's needle,

00:36:00,277 --> 00:36:01,512
and virology
confirmed

00:36:01,579 --> 00:36:02,880
that it tested
positive for rabies.

00:36:02,947 --> 00:36:04,481
Any DNA on the syringe?
Yeah.

00:36:04,548 --> 00:36:06,283
I just don't know
if it's a match to Shaw yet

00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:07,484
'cause Langston
just dropped off the exemplar

00:36:07,551 --> 00:36:08,586
on his way out of town.

00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,255
Out of town?

00:36:14,325 --> 00:36:16,560
(blues music playing
over stereo)

00:36:16,627 --> 00:36:18,128
Did you tell Nick
what we're doing?

00:36:18,195 --> 00:36:19,997
I did not tell Nick
what we were doing,

00:36:20,064 --> 00:36:22,333
just in case things
don't go according to plan.

00:36:22,399 --> 00:36:23,834
Gives him plausible deniability.

00:36:23,901 --> 00:36:25,002
Correct.

00:36:25,069 --> 00:36:26,503
You know, we're kind of screwed

00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:28,739
if the hospital doesn't have
hard copies of the documents.

00:36:28,806 --> 00:36:29,974
Mm-hmm.

00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,843
Good thing being a doctor
has more advantages

00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:34,478
than just getting hot chicks.

00:36:34,545 --> 00:36:36,580
(chuckling)

Thank you.

00:37:00,237 --> 00:37:02,973
(both laughing)

00:37:07,211 --> 00:37:08,679
Hello.
Hello.

00:37:08,746 --> 00:37:10,848
Uh, Frank,
how are you today?

00:37:10,915 --> 00:37:12,650
Never seen you guys before.

00:37:12,716 --> 00:37:14,785
Are you attendings or surgeons?

00:37:14,852 --> 00:37:16,620
We're researchers.
ROBBINS:
Yeah, we're from,

00:37:16,687 --> 00:37:17,788
uh, Saint Ann's.

00:37:17,855 --> 00:37:20,357
Uh, we're doing
research for the, uh...

00:37:20,424 --> 00:37:22,059

00:37:22,126 --> 00:37:23,561
Not the, uh, team in Arizona.

00:37:23,627 --> 00:37:25,396
The, uh, guy who wears

00:37:25,462 --> 00:37:26,463
the pointy red hat,
cardinal.

00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:28,032
Medical I.D.'s, please.

00:37:30,968 --> 00:37:33,637
You're not allowed to remove

ROBBINS:
Yeah, we...

00:37:45,216 --> 00:37:47,051
we got it, Frank.

00:37:50,187 --> 00:37:51,655
Next time,
you don't talk.

00:37:51,722 --> 00:37:53,824
I don't talk?
I don't think <i>you</i> should talk.

00:37:53,891 --> 00:37:56,527
So, we have a liver transplant.

00:37:56,594 --> 00:37:58,662
Recipient was Sandra Williams.

00:37:58,729 --> 00:37:59,930
This patient
did well

00:37:59,997 --> 00:38:01,732
immediately
after transplantation.

00:38:01,799 --> 00:38:05,169
Discharged on
postoperative day five.

00:38:05,236 --> 00:38:08,939
21 days after transplant,
she was readmitted

00:38:09,006 --> 00:38:11,942
with tremors,
lethargy and anorexia.

00:38:12,009 --> 00:38:14,044
During the next
48 hours,

00:38:14,111 --> 00:38:16,013
her mental status
deteriorated.

00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,281
She subsequently died.

00:38:17,348 --> 00:38:19,750
Initial diagnosis
was encephalitis.
Hmm.

00:38:19,817 --> 00:38:21,452
Well, it says here

00:38:21,518 --> 00:38:24,221
that the recipient's husband,
Eric Tobin,

00:38:24,288 --> 00:38:26,790
filed a lawsuit

00:38:26,857 --> 00:38:29,593
against the hospital
and its medical personnel.

00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:30,928
Not surprising.

00:38:30,995 --> 00:38:32,563
Did you say <i>Eric</i> Tobin?

00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:33,764
Mm-hmm.

00:38:33,831 --> 00:38:35,466
ERIC:
It's, uh,
Jack's Body Shop,

00:38:35,532 --> 00:38:38,535
and my name is Eric--
Eric Tobin.

00:38:38,602 --> 00:38:41,205
What, you don't think
he's some sort of mastermind

00:38:41,272 --> 00:38:43,107
that framed Dr. Shaw, do you?

00:38:43,173 --> 00:38:44,742
I mean, come on,
Ray, you met him.

00:38:44,808 --> 00:38:46,610
He's not even the master
of his own mind.

00:38:46,677 --> 00:38:47,811
He has motive, Nick.

00:38:47,878 --> 00:38:49,480
He blames Shaw
for his wife's death.

00:38:49,547 --> 00:38:51,148
Tobin won a malpractice suit.

00:38:51,215 --> 00:38:52,816
That's big bucks.

00:38:52,883 --> 00:38:54,885
The only reason he'd work
at the shop

00:38:54,952 --> 00:38:55,886
is for revenge.

00:38:55,953 --> 00:38:57,154
Well, gentlemen,

00:38:57,221 --> 00:38:59,557
all of the physical evidence
points to Dr. Shaw.

00:38:59,623 --> 00:39:02,660
Wendy found his touch DNA on
the syringe that infected Tobin.

00:39:02,726 --> 00:39:04,895
And while you two
were out playing

00:39:04,962 --> 00:39:05,996
Smokey and
the Bandit,

00:39:06,063 --> 00:39:07,331
his girlfriend,
who's also a nurse

00:39:07,398 --> 00:39:09,967
at the clinic, brought me
something he was trying

00:39:10,034 --> 00:39:11,802
to get rid of:
a salivary gland

00:39:11,869 --> 00:39:12,870
from a rabid bat.

00:39:12,937 --> 00:39:13,904
I think that's

00:39:13,971 --> 00:39:15,773
what he used to make the virus.

00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:19,677
<i>Rabid bats are easy to spot</i>
<i>because they stay within reach,</i>

00:39:19,743 --> 00:39:22,246
<i>even when a human</i>
<i>enters their cave.</i>

00:39:22,313 --> 00:39:25,182
<i>All he had to do</i>
<i>was extract the saliva</i>

00:39:25,249 --> 00:39:28,686
<i>and add a preservative to keep</i>
<i>the rabies virus viable.</i>

00:39:28,752 --> 00:39:31,522
Look, I don't know
how Tobin plays into all this,

00:39:31,589 --> 00:39:33,757
but Shaw is still
our best suspect.

00:39:33,824 --> 00:39:37,628
Besides, it takes technical
skill and knowledge

00:39:37,695 --> 00:39:39,763
to extract the rabies virus
like that.

00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:42,166
Then Tobin isn't working alone.

00:39:42,233 --> 00:39:43,968
He's partnered
with a mastermind.

00:39:44,034 --> 00:39:45,536
You said Shaw's girlfriend
is a nurse,

00:39:45,603 --> 00:39:47,838
and she brought you
that evidence.

00:39:47,905 --> 00:39:49,873
I'm suspicious of anybody
who brings me anything.

00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:51,342
I ran Susan Schiff

00:39:51,408 --> 00:39:52,343
through the system.

00:39:52,409 --> 00:39:53,644
There was no criminal record.

00:39:53,711 --> 00:39:55,145
She could still be lying.

00:39:55,212 --> 00:39:56,614
Maybe there's
another connection.

00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:59,283
Did Susan Schiff live in Reno?

00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:00,751
Run her Social.

00:40:13,297 --> 00:40:14,999
(computer beeping)

00:40:19,937 --> 00:40:21,872
Susan Schiff...

00:40:21,939 --> 00:40:23,707
also known as Susan Williams.

00:40:23,774 --> 00:40:25,709
The woman
who died in Reno...

00:40:25,776 --> 00:40:28,245
her name was Sandra Williams.

00:40:28,312 --> 00:40:31,649
My daughter was on
the transplant list for a year.

00:40:31,715 --> 00:40:34,718
Sandy was so excited
when her name finally came up.

00:40:34,785 --> 00:40:36,754
She and Eric started planning
for their future.

00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:39,557
She wanted to have a baby.

00:40:39,623 --> 00:40:42,192
But because of Dr. Shaw
and his negligence,

00:40:42,259 --> 00:40:44,228
what she got
was 21 days of hell.

00:40:44,295 --> 00:40:45,930
You ever seen somebody die
of rabies?

00:40:45,996 --> 00:40:48,499
I've seen people die
all kinds of ways.

00:40:48,566 --> 00:40:50,200
I understand he made

00:40:50,267 --> 00:40:52,336
a fatal mistake-- I really do--

00:40:52,403 --> 00:40:54,238
but that doesn't
give you the right

00:40:54,305 --> 00:40:55,539
to kill four innocent people.

00:40:55,606 --> 00:40:57,274
Those men weren't innocent.

00:40:57,341 --> 00:40:59,176
They were a different kind
of virus.

00:40:59,243 --> 00:41:00,477
I told you
when we met,

00:41:00,544 --> 00:41:02,112
Brent Kelly
was a low-life drug dealer

00:41:02,179 --> 00:41:04,281
who beat up his own mother.

00:41:04,348 --> 00:41:06,550
And the other two, Eric chose.

00:41:06,617 --> 00:41:09,119
Those guys would come
into the shop and brag

00:41:09,186 --> 00:41:12,790
about selling drugs to kids
and having sex with minors.

00:41:12,856 --> 00:41:15,059
Where were you guys?

00:41:15,125 --> 00:41:16,594
You know,
I'm a little confused, Batman.

00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:18,362
Was your mission
to avenge your wife's death

00:41:18,429 --> 00:41:20,531
or rid Gotham of scumbags?

00:41:20,598 --> 00:41:21,765
STOKES:
<i>What about Darla Kelly?</i>

00:41:21,832 --> 00:41:24,235
She was innocent.

00:41:24,301 --> 00:41:25,936
I thought you liked her.

00:41:26,003 --> 00:41:27,371
That one's on Brent.

00:41:27,438 --> 00:41:29,139
I always knew
he'd kill her someday.

00:41:29,206 --> 00:41:31,275
What about your son-in-law?

00:41:31,342 --> 00:41:32,343
I volunteered.

00:41:32,409 --> 00:41:33,978
You hadn't arrested Shaw yet.

00:41:34,044 --> 00:41:35,713
Plus...

00:41:35,779 --> 00:41:38,182
Sue wasn't going to let me die.

00:41:38,249 --> 00:41:39,450
I'm not stupid.

00:41:39,516 --> 00:41:40,517
Not anymore.

00:41:40,584 --> 00:41:41,785
How did you pull it off?

00:41:41,852 --> 00:41:43,687
I got a piercing.

00:41:45,022 --> 00:41:46,223
<i>I knew that Dr. Shaw</i>

00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:48,092
<i>would give me a shot</i>
<i>of antibiotics.</i>

00:41:48,158 --> 00:41:49,560
<i>That's his SOP.</i>

00:41:49,627 --> 00:41:52,296
<i>Sue gave me a vial</i>
<i>of the virus.</i>

00:41:52,363 --> 00:41:54,265
I slapped on a label.

00:41:54,331 --> 00:41:56,967
Susan, you don't
get to play God

00:41:57,034 --> 00:42:00,437
because your daughter died--
that's not the way it works.

00:42:00,504 --> 00:42:03,707
Dr. Shaw didn't just kill
my little girl.

00:42:03,774 --> 00:42:05,776
He killed my whole family.

00:42:05,843 --> 00:42:08,545
My sons, my parents,
my marriage.

00:42:08,612 --> 00:42:09,613
Eric.

00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,750
We all died
that day.

00:42:12,816 --> 00:42:15,753
And Dr. Shaw
didn't lose anything.

00:42:15,819 --> 00:42:18,389
And that's just wrong.

00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:27,731
You wanted to see me.

00:42:27,798 --> 00:42:29,700
Wanted to thank you.

00:42:29,767 --> 00:42:30,868
What for?

00:42:30,935 --> 00:42:32,770
For believing in my innocence.

00:42:32,836 --> 00:42:35,072
I just didn't assume
you were guilty.

00:42:36,106 --> 00:42:38,342
You know, I was good--

00:42:38,409 --> 00:42:40,611
really good-- at my job.

00:42:40,678 --> 00:42:42,546
I just wasn't good enough.

00:42:42,613 --> 00:42:44,348
I understand, Doctor.

00:42:44,415 --> 00:42:46,917
I've been there.

00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,909
Remember that solid you owe me?

00:43:11,976 --> 00:43:13,344
(sighs)

00:43:13,410 --> 00:43:16,513
It's going to take more
than show tickets, isn't it?

00:43:17,581 --> 00:43:18,983
Oh, yeah.
