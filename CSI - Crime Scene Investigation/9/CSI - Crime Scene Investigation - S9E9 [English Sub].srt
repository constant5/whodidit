00:00:15,012 --> 00:00:17,314
See, just like
I told you, right?

00:00:19,917 --> 00:00:22,720
It really brings back
the good old days, huh?

00:00:25,723 --> 00:00:29,727
So, what do you think
it's worth?

00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:34,998

at the city dump.

00:03:00,544 --> 00:03:01,812
Awesome.

00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:04,415

GRISSOM:
And for our new
CSI level three,

00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:13,090
411A, recovered
stolen vehicle at McCarran.

00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:16,226
Nick, 402,

00:03:16,293 --> 00:03:18,529
possible arson
at the Burger Giant.

00:03:18,595 --> 00:03:20,097
Well, there goes the night.

00:03:20,164 --> 00:03:21,565
Why don't we all
meet up

00:03:21,632 --> 00:03:22,966
at the coffee shop
after work?

00:03:23,033 --> 00:03:24,501
Level three over here
is gonna buy.

00:03:24,568 --> 00:03:25,836
(chuckles)

00:03:25,903 --> 00:03:27,337
I'll take care of breakfast.

00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:31,975
And the 419 in Green Valley.

00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,044
Looks like
the king gets

00:03:34,111 --> 00:03:36,280
to sit on the bench
for now.

00:03:37,314 --> 00:03:38,849
That it?

00:03:41,652 --> 00:03:43,153
No.

00:03:45,522 --> 00:03:49,493
I know this has been
a tough year for all of us,

00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,328
and I've been thinking...

00:03:51,395 --> 00:03:54,465
I mean, more than usual.

00:03:54,531 --> 00:03:57,167
I made a decision.

00:03:57,234 --> 00:03:59,703
I'm gonna leave CSI.

00:04:04,908 --> 00:04:07,578
Catherine will become
the new supervisor,

00:04:07,644 --> 00:04:09,713
so you'll be in good hands.

00:04:13,283 --> 00:04:16,887
While I'm clearing my caseload,
Ecklie's preparing a list

00:04:16,954 --> 00:04:19,456
of candidates
for a new level one hire,

00:04:19,523 --> 00:04:21,058
so...

00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:23,494
you won't be shorthanded.

00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,562
(phone ringing)

00:04:30,134 --> 00:04:31,468
And I guess I just

00:04:31,535 --> 00:04:33,203
came off the bench.

00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:36,006
419 at Mount Charleston.

00:05:54,264 --> 00:05:56,866
I was just wondering what it
would be like to go fly fishing.

00:05:56,933 --> 00:05:58,334
(chuckles)

00:05:58,401 --> 00:06:00,770
Uh, a couple of hikers came
across the body this morning.

00:06:00,837 --> 00:06:02,839
According to them,
it's not a popular trail.

00:06:02,906 --> 00:06:04,707
How long do you think
that's been here?

00:06:04,774 --> 00:06:05,942
I don't know.

00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:08,111
Sealed bag,
cool, moist environment.

00:06:08,177 --> 00:06:10,146
Could be weeks, could be years.

00:06:10,213 --> 00:06:11,281
But it's definitely human.

00:06:11,347 --> 00:06:12,549
Call the coroner.

00:06:12,615 --> 00:06:14,217
Tell him he's got soup to go.

00:06:16,052 --> 00:06:18,087
This is Henry-5.
We need a coroner...

00:06:18,154 --> 00:06:21,157
(slushing)

00:06:28,331 --> 00:06:30,466
All right, so let me
get this straight.

00:06:30,533 --> 00:06:33,336
Grissom didn't say that he
was leaving permanently,

00:06:33,403 --> 00:06:36,139
so he could be taking
a leave of absence.

00:06:36,205 --> 00:06:37,173
That's a form

00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,207
of leaving, right?

00:06:38,274 --> 00:06:40,577
I think this
is leaving, leaving.

00:06:40,643 --> 00:06:42,412
What's he gonna do?

00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:44,247
Teach?

00:06:44,314 --> 00:06:46,349
Write a book, go off
and study bugs somewhere?

00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:47,917
You know as much as I do, Nicky.

00:06:57,994 --> 00:06:59,395
Star of David.

00:06:59,462 --> 00:07:01,064
Looks like some kind
of pendant.

00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,799
Victim must
have been Jewish.

00:07:02,865 --> 00:07:04,334
These clothes

00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,568
are pretty generic.

00:07:05,635 --> 00:07:08,838
Jeans, T-shirt, sneakers.

00:07:08,905 --> 00:07:10,673
It's not gonna
help with TOD

00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,642
or sex.

00:07:12,709 --> 00:07:15,511
There's hair in our soup.

00:07:15,578 --> 00:07:18,982
Most of them are brown,
but some of them are blonde.

00:07:19,048 --> 00:07:20,583
So, maybe the vic got a piece
of the attacker.

00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:23,052
Or maybe the victim
just had a streak

00:07:23,119 --> 00:07:24,754
of dyed hair.

00:07:24,821 --> 00:07:27,357
Hodges...

00:07:27,423 --> 00:07:28,491
Hodges.

00:07:28,558 --> 00:07:29,659
Hmm?

00:07:29,726 --> 00:07:31,728
Collect and separate

00:07:31,794 --> 00:07:33,062
both sets
of hairs.

00:07:33,129 --> 00:07:34,430
Get them over to Wendy.

00:07:34,497 --> 00:07:36,900
Run exemplars for
mitochondrial DNA.

00:07:36,966 --> 00:07:38,735
It's best to stay busy.

00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,543
ROBBINS:
Based on skull morphology
and femoral bone dimensions,

00:07:46,609 --> 00:07:49,546
I'd say we're looking
at a Caucasian male,

00:07:49,612 --> 00:07:51,548
around five feet, nine inches.

00:07:51,614 --> 00:07:54,117
Partial fusion
of the coronal-cranial suture

00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:57,620
says that he was at
least 25 years old.

00:07:57,687 --> 00:07:59,088
Any idea of COD?

00:07:59,155 --> 00:08:00,590
Very good idea.

00:08:00,657 --> 00:08:02,358
Broken hyoid.

00:08:02,425 --> 00:08:03,993
Strangulation.
Yep.

00:08:05,828 --> 00:08:07,297
Are you really leaving?

00:08:07,363 --> 00:08:08,798
Yep.

00:08:10,433 --> 00:08:12,735
Think of it
this way, Doc.

00:08:12,802 --> 00:08:14,971
You'll have somebody new you
can tell all your old jokes to.

00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:16,906
I like the old guy just fine.

00:08:16,973 --> 00:08:20,577
Are you, uh, running
away from something?

00:08:20,643 --> 00:08:22,812
Or running <i>to</i> something?

00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:23,947
Someone?

00:08:24,013 --> 00:08:26,282
I'm running to my office.

00:08:26,349 --> 00:08:27,951
I think you're nuts.

00:08:28,017 --> 00:08:29,185
(door closing)

00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:34,090
I am never going to retire.

00:09:00,483 --> 00:09:02,452
(sighs)

00:09:23,539 --> 00:09:26,609
GRISSOM:
<i>The Dick and Jane Killer's name</i>
<i>is Nathan Haskell.</i>

00:09:26,676 --> 00:09:28,878
<i>Suspected of killing</i>
<i>at least 14 people</i>

00:09:28,945 --> 00:09:32,048
<i>in Nevada, California</i>
<i>and Arizona in the mid-90s.</i>

00:09:32,115 --> 00:09:35,251
<i>He was picked up at a sobriety</i>
<i>checkpoint near Reno.</i>

00:09:35,318 --> 00:09:36,853
<i>It was a lucky break.</i>

00:09:38,087 --> 00:09:39,989
<i>The blood on his car</i>
<i>matched a male DB</i>

00:09:40,056 --> 00:09:42,058
<i>dumped in the desert</i>
<i>several weeks earlier.</i>

00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:43,626
(camera clicking)

00:09:43,693 --> 00:09:45,995
<i>And he had blood</i>
<i>under his nails</i>

00:09:46,062 --> 00:09:48,298
<i>which matched another male DB</i>
<i>who had just been found.</i>

00:09:48,364 --> 00:09:50,333
<i>A witness placed him</i>
<i>with one of the vics.</i>

00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,335
<i>There was a potential</i>
<i>murder weapon.</i>

00:09:52,402 --> 00:09:53,903
<i>Case went to trial.</i>

00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:56,973
<i>In the middle,</i>
<i>Haskell changed his plea.</i>

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,410
He got life without parole,
and he's serving it at Ely.

00:10:00,476 --> 00:10:01,444
I remember this guy.

00:10:01,511 --> 00:10:03,713
He was called
the Dick and Jane Killer

00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,315
because he targeted couples.

00:10:05,381 --> 00:10:06,816
It says here not any

00:10:06,883 --> 00:10:08,918
of the female vics
were ever found.

00:10:08,985 --> 00:10:10,987
He refused
to discuss the females,

00:10:11,054 --> 00:10:12,522
but seven
male bodies

00:10:12,589 --> 00:10:14,757
were found in various
remote locations,

00:10:14,824 --> 00:10:17,026
each with postmortem
stab wounds.

00:10:17,093 --> 00:10:19,762
The first body they found
had two stab wounds.

00:10:19,829 --> 00:10:22,031
The second body
had three stab wounds.

00:10:22,098 --> 00:10:23,566
The third had four,

00:10:23,633 --> 00:10:24,801
then five, six,
seven and eight,

00:10:24,867 --> 00:10:26,903
so the theory was

00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:29,439
that the first couple
was never found.

00:10:29,505 --> 00:10:31,574
STOKES:
And Joel Steiner
and his fiancÃ©e

00:10:31,641 --> 00:10:35,478
were considered possible victims
since they lived near DJK

00:10:35,545 --> 00:10:37,580
and they were reported missing
in 1997.

00:10:37,647 --> 00:10:41,284
That's before any
of the other confirmed victims.

00:10:41,351 --> 00:10:44,654
<i>Guess all we need</i>
<i>is a positive ID on Joel.</i>

00:10:48,892 --> 00:10:50,260
I had this
made for Joel

00:10:50,326 --> 00:10:52,195
for his bar
mitzvah.

00:10:52,262 --> 00:10:54,464
He had a matching
one made

00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:57,500
for his fiancÃ©e when
they got engaged.

00:10:57,567 --> 00:10:59,836
Oh, Mrs. Steiner,
I'm sorry.

00:11:00,837 --> 00:11:02,238
You can't take it with you.

00:11:02,305 --> 00:11:04,741
It's, uh... it's evidence
in an active case.

00:11:04,807 --> 00:11:06,376
I promise to get it
back to you

00:11:06,442 --> 00:11:07,644
right after
we confirm the I.D.

00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:08,778
of your son's remains.
I will.

00:11:08,845 --> 00:11:09,913
I'll get it back to you.

00:11:09,979 --> 00:11:11,581
But you can't keep it right now.

00:11:11,648 --> 00:11:13,283
Sorry.
It's all right.

00:11:13,349 --> 00:11:15,318
Thank you.

00:11:15,385 --> 00:11:18,321
Thanks.

00:11:18,388 --> 00:11:20,757
I'm also going to need DNA
samples from each of you.

00:11:20,823 --> 00:11:22,425
But you already have Joel's DNA.

00:11:22,492 --> 00:11:25,361
We gave it to the police
in Reno, 11 years ago.

00:11:25,428 --> 00:11:28,364
I gave them his toothbrush.

00:11:28,431 --> 00:11:30,466
They sent the sample out
to a private lab

00:11:30,533 --> 00:11:32,869
for DNA analysis,
and that lab, um,

00:11:32,936 --> 00:11:34,871
misplaced it
or lost it.

00:11:34,938 --> 00:11:36,639
It happens.

00:11:36,706 --> 00:11:39,475
David, I've been meaning
to talk to you.

00:11:39,542 --> 00:11:41,477
It's a little too late
for that, huh?

00:11:41,544 --> 00:11:43,479
Hey, you gotta do
what you gotta do.

00:11:43,546 --> 00:11:45,548
Have a nice life.

that those hairs might
actually be connected

00:12:47,043 --> 00:12:48,311
to the Dick and
Jane killer,

00:12:48,378 --> 00:12:50,980
I just put the screws to this
guy I know at Accuregen.

00:12:51,047 --> 00:12:52,649
And he ran our mito
samples immediately.

00:12:52,715 --> 00:12:53,816
(chuckles)

00:12:53,883 --> 00:12:55,151
What do you got on him?

00:12:55,218 --> 00:12:57,153
He's my uncle.

00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,489
I really didn't want to wait
around for three weeks

00:12:59,556 --> 00:13:01,491
and then get the results
after you were gone.

00:13:01,558 --> 00:13:03,493
And it turns out

00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,662
that the blonde hairs are
definitely a mito DNA match

00:13:05,728 --> 00:13:07,163
to Nathan Haskell.

00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:09,432
Well, as far as we know,
he was an only child.

00:13:09,499 --> 00:13:11,267
So, it's got
to be him.
Grissom.

00:13:17,674 --> 00:13:19,375
For the support
and the encouragement

00:13:19,442 --> 00:13:20,476
that you've given me.

00:13:21,511 --> 00:13:23,980
You earned it.

00:13:25,348 --> 00:13:26,849
Wendy.

00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:28,618
Wasn't the
"body soup" vic

00:13:28,685 --> 00:13:30,787
I.D.'d as the DJK's
first victim?

00:13:30,853 --> 00:13:33,423
Yes. Brass said
that Joel Steiner's

00:13:33,489 --> 00:13:36,359
parents confirmed that the Star
of David pendant was his.

00:13:36,426 --> 00:13:38,761
And we're getting their DNA
to positively establish I.D.

00:13:38,828 --> 00:13:41,798
Okay, I don't believe that
it was Joel Steiner.

00:13:41,864 --> 00:13:45,301
The sneakers that Soup Man was
wearing were made two years ago.

00:13:45,368 --> 00:13:49,038
And the Dick and Jane Killer's
been in jail for at least ten.

00:13:49,105 --> 00:13:51,541
Well, how did he end up
with DJK's hair on his body?

00:13:51,608 --> 00:13:53,810
And who is he?

00:13:56,459 --> 00:13:58,261
Lindsey was once given
a gift certificate

00:13:58,328 --> 00:13:59,896
for a pair
of customized jeans.

00:13:59,963 --> 00:14:01,898
So we go to the store,

00:14:01,965 --> 00:14:05,902
we spend two hours
picking out the wash,

00:14:05,969 --> 00:14:07,904
the rivets,
you name it.

00:14:07,971 --> 00:14:10,373
And-and she has
her boyfriend's name

00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,409
embroidered on her butt pocket.

00:14:12,475 --> 00:14:14,411
Well, guess what?

00:14:14,477 --> 00:14:16,680
She breaks up with the guy
a week later.

00:14:16,746 --> 00:14:17,914
She doesn't wear 'em once.

00:14:17,981 --> 00:14:19,616
Still beats a tattoo, right?

00:14:19,683 --> 00:14:20,784
Oh, don't go there.

00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:22,719
(sighs):
In any case,

00:14:22,786 --> 00:14:25,789
the sneakers were
definitely a custom job.

00:14:25,855 --> 00:14:29,125
We got a warrant
for the customer records.

00:14:34,698 --> 00:14:38,268
Catherine, I, uh,

00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:41,171
I know I surprised you today

00:14:41,238 --> 00:14:43,206
with the...

00:14:43,273 --> 00:14:44,841
I knew.

00:14:48,144 --> 00:14:50,146
I knew before you knew.

00:14:59,289 --> 00:15:01,258
Well,

00:15:01,324 --> 00:15:03,994
looks like the sneakers
were "designed"

00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:07,063
by a Gerald Tolliver.

00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:08,832
See if he's in missing persons.

00:15:13,136 --> 00:15:15,272
Well, he's not only missing,
he's got a record.

00:15:15,338 --> 00:15:17,641
Petty larceny,
grand larceny.

00:15:17,707 --> 00:15:19,242
Several drug busts.

00:15:19,309 --> 00:15:20,577
Reno P.D. registered him

00:15:20,644 --> 00:15:24,180
as a criminal informant just
before he disappeared,

00:15:24,247 --> 00:15:25,315
six months ago.

00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:27,217
<i>You know what that means?</i>

00:15:27,284 --> 00:15:28,285
WILLOWS:
<i>Road trip.</i>

00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:40,463
Kenny Martz,
Reno P.D.

00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:42,465
Nick Stokes.
Greg Sanders.

00:15:42,532 --> 00:15:44,467
So, did you work this case?

00:15:44,534 --> 00:15:46,970
No, but I brought
the related file.

00:15:47,037 --> 00:15:48,638
Anything having
to do with DJK

00:15:48,705 --> 00:15:50,073
is near and dear
to my heart.

00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,741
Busted him back when
I was in uniform.

00:15:51,808 --> 00:15:53,743
Practically made
my career.

00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:56,112
So you guys held this scene
for six months?

00:15:56,179 --> 00:15:57,147
Not intentionally.

00:15:57,213 --> 00:15:59,215
The house is still in probate.

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,529
MARTZ:
Our CSIs found some blood drops

00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:13,563
on this wall.

00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:14,731
They sampled it

00:16:14,798 --> 00:16:17,500
for DNA, and matched it
to Gerald Tolliver.

00:16:17,567 --> 00:16:19,536
We'd gotten him to roll
on some local junkies.

00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:21,805
We were just starting to move
him up the food chain.

00:16:21,871 --> 00:16:23,640
We figured he pissed
somebody off,

00:16:23,707 --> 00:16:25,375
got into a fight,
skipped town.

00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:27,377
Is there blood on the floor
as well?

00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:29,412
MARTZ:
Yeah.

00:16:29,479 --> 00:16:31,014
They luminoled this area.

00:16:31,081 --> 00:16:33,016
There wasn't
much blood,

00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:35,752
not enough to
suggest murder.

00:16:35,819 --> 00:16:36,920
They found what appears to be

00:16:36,987 --> 00:16:39,055
<i>a partial shoe tread</i>
<i>in this blood.</i>

00:16:43,994 --> 00:16:46,229
Look, Gerald
Tolliver was 17

00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:48,231
when DJK was doing his business.

00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:49,900
He never turned up
in the investigation.

00:16:49,966 --> 00:16:50,934
So what's the connection?

00:16:51,001 --> 00:16:52,435
We don't know.

00:16:52,502 --> 00:16:53,503
That's why we're here.

00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:56,006
Looks like Gerald was

00:16:56,072 --> 00:16:57,607
a collector of sorts.

00:16:57,674 --> 00:17:00,777
Maybe he was one of those 
"murderabilia" freaks, you know?

00:17:00,844 --> 00:17:03,280
All it takes is one shady
prison barber,

00:17:03,346 --> 00:17:06,182
and suddenly people are bidding
for a lock of DJK's hair

00:17:06,249 --> 00:17:08,051
on eBay.
But Joel Steiner's

00:17:08,118 --> 00:17:10,086
body was never found.

00:17:10,153 --> 00:17:12,255
How'd this guy end up
with his Star of David?

00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:14,090
I don't know.

00:17:14,157 --> 00:17:17,761
But I'm betting a guy like this
has other little "treasures"

00:17:17,827 --> 00:17:19,262
stashed around here somewhere.

<i>According to court transcripts,</i>

Haskell's attorneys were
attempting to argue

00:19:03,567 --> 00:19:06,336
that the murders were the work
of more than one killer.

00:19:06,403 --> 00:19:08,371
That's when Haskell
changed his plea.

00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:09,539
What was the theory?

00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:11,041
That it would've
been impossible

00:19:11,107 --> 00:19:13,543
for Haskell to have
strangled the males

00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:14,878

controlling the females.

00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:16,913

Well, these guys are
all narcissists.

00:19:23,186 --> 00:19:25,155
Maybe Haskell just didn't want
to share the spotlight.

00:19:25,222 --> 00:19:28,658

just a murderabilia collector.

You guys aren't
going to believe this.

00:19:51,781 --> 00:19:54,384
Remember that apparent
S &amp;amp;amp;amp; M double murder

00:19:54,451 --> 00:19:55,919
from five
weeks ago?

00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,654
Well, whoever killed
Gerald Tolliver

00:19:57,721 --> 00:20:00,290
was also involved in the murders
of Ian Wallace

00:20:00,357 --> 00:20:01,758

00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,035
<i>with the DJK's MO.</i>

00:20:12,102 --> 00:20:14,304
I think we're dealing
with a copycat

00:20:14,371 --> 00:20:16,573
who was trying to make Ian
and Justine the ninth couple.

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,209
STOKES:
A DJK copycat
who just so happened

00:20:19,276 --> 00:20:21,645
to kill a DJK accomplice

00:20:21,711 --> 00:20:24,147
that nobody knew existed
till just now?

00:20:24,214 --> 00:20:26,416
I've clearly missed something.

00:20:26,483 --> 00:20:27,717
I'll catch you up.

00:20:27,784 --> 00:20:30,720
So let's just go up to Ely
and question him.

00:20:30,787 --> 00:20:32,422
This guy pled guilty
to avoid even the suggestion

00:20:32,489 --> 00:20:33,557
that he wasn't responsible.

00:20:33,623 --> 00:20:35,225
He's not going to talk to us.

00:20:35,292 --> 00:20:37,394
All roads lead to Rome.

00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,895
BRASS:
<i>So Ely State Prison</i>

00:20:38,962 --> 00:20:41,264

video logs, phone records
of the Dick and Jane Killer.

00:20:44,301 --> 00:20:46,369

VARTANN:
Captain, something
interesting.

00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:27,410
It's not a connection between
DJK and Gerald Tolliver,

00:21:27,477 --> 00:21:29,713
but there is a lot
of back and forth
between the warden

00:21:29,779 --> 00:21:32,082
and a professor
at WLVU.

00:21:32,148 --> 00:21:34,918
Apparently DJK's
participating in some kind

00:21:34,985 --> 00:21:36,686
of criminology seminar.

00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:37,887
They're setting up
a video conference

00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:43,360
Wow. I'd take that class.

00:21:45,028 --> 00:21:46,730
That's a good idea.

00:21:46,796 --> 00:21:48,665
You should do that.

<i>These letters say the seminar</i>

<i>We'd be risking too much</i>

<i>if he's not willing</i>
<i>to play ball, anyway.</i>

00:22:14,591 --> 00:22:17,394
Hello. I'm Dr. Raymond Langston.

00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,262
I'd like to welcome

00:22:19,329 --> 00:22:20,664
all those faculty members

00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:22,432
who have bravely come out
of the closet

00:22:22,499 --> 00:22:25,268
and revealed themselves
to be murder freaks.

00:22:25,335 --> 00:22:26,603
(laughter)

00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:27,871
Now, one of things

00:22:27,938 --> 00:22:30,106
I am most often asked is,

00:22:30,173 --> 00:22:32,409
"What does a serial killer
look like?"

00:22:32,475 --> 00:22:34,544
It's not a bad question.

00:22:34,611 --> 00:22:36,079
Statistically speaking,

00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:37,280
nine out of ten

00:22:37,347 --> 00:22:38,715
are Caucasian males
under the age

00:22:38,782 --> 00:22:40,483
of 30, but you
never know.

00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:43,186
There was the case
of a mother and daughter.

00:22:43,253 --> 00:22:47,224
In a three-year spree,
they killed over and over again,

00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:49,659
systematically murdering
ten infants,

00:22:49,726 --> 00:22:51,294
and they ate the remains.

00:22:54,731 --> 00:22:56,299
(class laughing)

00:22:56,366 --> 00:22:58,001
That's Passion

00:22:58,068 --> 00:23:02,839
Jane Goodall observed their
rampage in Gombe in the 70s.

00:23:02,906 --> 00:23:04,741
Now, remember, we human beings

00:23:04,808 --> 00:23:07,777
share 99.5% of our DNA
with chimps.

00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:09,446
The urge to kill...

00:23:09,512 --> 00:23:12,215
maybe it is just
a big-brain mammal thing,

00:23:12,282 --> 00:23:14,784
but it is in all of us.

00:23:24,494 --> 00:23:25,762
No names.

00:23:25,829 --> 00:23:26,963
And the warden

00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,532
has requested that the
ladies please refrain

00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:31,234
from wearing
any revealing clothing.

00:23:31,301 --> 00:23:32,369
My dear, you might want

00:23:32,435 --> 00:23:34,070
to put on
a sweater.

00:23:35,906 --> 00:23:39,042
Now, last semester,
some of you came to me

00:23:39,109 --> 00:23:41,878
and said you wanted to know
what the face of evil

00:23:41,945 --> 00:23:43,280
<i>looked like.</i>

00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:49,386
Well, here it is.

00:23:50,754 --> 00:23:52,589
Hello, class.

00:23:53,623 --> 00:23:55,692
Everybody ready to learn?

00:23:59,709 --> 00:24:01,644
What can you tell us
about your father?

00:24:02,779 --> 00:24:05,015
Apart from the fact
that he was a mean,

00:24:05,081 --> 00:24:07,951
miserable son of a bitch
who beat me at every occasion...

00:24:08,018 --> 00:24:09,786
nothing.

00:24:09,853 --> 00:24:11,321
What about your mother?

00:24:11,388 --> 00:24:14,657
Was that who that lady was
who lived with us?

00:24:14,724 --> 00:24:15,658
I always wondered.

00:24:15,725 --> 00:24:16,659
Mr. Haskell.

00:24:16,726 --> 00:24:18,461
I...

00:24:18,528 --> 00:24:21,097
killed my first small animal
when I was nine.

00:24:21,164 --> 00:24:23,233
It was a cat.

00:24:23,299 --> 00:24:25,468
It's usually a cat.

00:24:25,535 --> 00:24:26,569
Mr. Haskell.

00:24:26,636 --> 00:24:28,738
No one knows why that is.

00:24:28,805 --> 00:24:30,407
I mean, I know
it's a terrible thing...

00:24:30,473 --> 00:24:31,841
If you're going
to waste our time

00:24:31,908 --> 00:24:33,610
on playing games
and phony remorse,

00:24:33,677 --> 00:24:34,911
I'll pull the plug right now.

00:24:34,978 --> 00:24:37,080
Okay.

00:24:37,147 --> 00:24:39,382
Honesty it is, then.

00:24:39,449 --> 00:24:41,618
I didn't like your book.

00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:45,255
It's too technical
and too depressing.

00:24:45,321 --> 00:24:48,224
Then, let's talk
about something you enjoyed...

00:24:48,291 --> 00:24:50,226
your first kill.

00:24:50,293 --> 00:24:52,362
Oh, you never forget
your first time,

00:24:52,429 --> 00:24:54,731
but I think that discussion's
a little too intimate

00:24:54,798 --> 00:24:58,034
for this stage
of our relationship.

00:24:58,101 --> 00:25:00,837
Maybe when know each other
a little better.

00:25:00,904 --> 00:25:02,238
That's why we're here.

00:25:02,305 --> 00:25:05,141
Class, question and answer.

00:25:07,143 --> 00:25:08,678
Serial killers usually
have some sort

00:25:08,745 --> 00:25:10,280
of selection process.

00:25:10,347 --> 00:25:12,082
What was yours? How'd you
choose your victims?

00:25:12,148 --> 00:25:14,284
Did you ever buy a car?

00:25:14,351 --> 00:25:16,186
You go down to the showroom.

00:25:16,252 --> 00:25:17,654
You're pretty sure
you're gonna get one,

00:25:17,721 --> 00:25:18,688
but why the red one?

00:25:18,755 --> 00:25:20,557
Why not the blue one?

00:25:20,623 --> 00:25:22,892
Nobody knows, but...

00:25:22,959 --> 00:25:24,761
just one of them speaks to you

00:25:24,828 --> 00:25:26,596
and that's the one
you got to have.

00:25:28,031 --> 00:25:31,401
How much premeditation
was involved?

00:25:31,468 --> 00:25:34,270
Did you fantasize about
what you were going to do?

00:25:34,337 --> 00:25:35,839
Of course, I did.

00:25:36,873 --> 00:25:38,108
All the time.

00:25:38,174 --> 00:25:40,910
You remind me of my first lay.

00:25:41,945 --> 00:25:43,747
She was a hooker.

00:25:45,448 --> 00:25:47,117
I mean that as a compliment.

00:25:47,183 --> 00:25:49,119
GRISSOM:
Did, uh...

00:25:49,185 --> 00:25:52,489
you ever share any
of your experiences with anyone?

00:25:52,555 --> 00:25:54,224
Like, with a buddy?

00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:56,092
I didn't have any buddies.

00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:57,394
Well, you must
have had some friends.

00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:59,896
You seem like you
could be friendly.

00:25:59,963 --> 00:26:02,766
These days, I mostly have fans.

00:26:02,832 --> 00:26:06,503
I get at least two or three
marriage proposals every month,

00:26:06,569 --> 00:26:08,705
but...

00:26:08,772 --> 00:26:11,408
they don't allow
conjugal visits,

00:26:11,474 --> 00:26:15,945
so why carry the baggage
when you can't have the fun?

00:26:16,012 --> 00:26:18,748
You're not a student.

00:26:18,815 --> 00:26:21,051
What do you teach?

00:26:22,085 --> 00:26:23,486
Sociology.

00:26:24,554 --> 00:26:27,991
Tell us your definition of fun.

00:26:28,058 --> 00:26:31,594
Fun is taking something away
from somebody.

00:26:32,629 --> 00:26:34,931
Like...

00:26:35,965 --> 00:26:38,401
a nice Jewish girl,
for example.

00:26:38,468 --> 00:26:40,904
Taking her off
on a little vacation.

00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:43,473
Just three days and three nights

00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:45,141
of Heaven on Earth.

00:26:45,208 --> 00:26:47,610
And then... just Heaven.

00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,314
<i>L'chaim.</i>

00:26:51,381 --> 00:26:54,351
The night before Ian Wallace
and Justine Stefani were killed,

00:26:54,417 --> 00:26:55,952
they went to a Paramore concert,

00:26:56,019 --> 00:26:57,921
and according
to his credit card records,

00:26:57,987 --> 00:26:59,656
he bought tickets
for all three nights:

00:26:59,723 --> 00:27:01,991
Thursday, Friday and Saturday.

00:27:02,058 --> 00:27:04,894
And we also found these
old Pearl Jam ticket stubs

00:27:04,961 --> 00:27:06,696
in Gerald Tolliver's
mattress.

00:27:06,763 --> 00:27:09,599
According to the DJK file,
Joel Steiner

00:27:09,666 --> 00:27:11,034
and his fiancÃ©e went missing

00:27:11,101 --> 00:27:13,003
after attending that concert
back in '97.

00:27:13,069 --> 00:27:17,073
So, maybe the killer
finds his victims at concerts.

00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,775
STOKES:
Exactly,
so we checked

00:27:18,842 --> 00:27:20,276
with the online
ticketing service.

00:27:20,343 --> 00:27:22,045
Hard tickets were mailed
to Ian--

00:27:22,112 --> 00:27:23,580
they all get scanned
at the venue--

00:27:23,646 --> 00:27:25,615
but on the night
of Ian and Justine's murder,

00:27:25,682 --> 00:27:27,083
they were never used.

00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:29,219
But the ones
from Saturday night were.

00:27:31,021 --> 00:27:34,724
You waste a couple...
why waste the tickets?

00:27:34,791 --> 00:27:36,860
MALE STUDENT:
You never revealed the location

00:27:36,926 --> 00:27:39,396
of any of your
female victims. Why?

00:27:39,462 --> 00:27:43,700
Because nobody ever asked me
that question ever before.

00:27:43,767 --> 00:27:45,869
I always thought it was strange.

00:27:45,935 --> 00:27:48,738
Well, then, tell us now.

00:27:48,805 --> 00:27:50,040
Why not?

00:27:50,106 --> 00:27:52,275
You're serving two consecutive
life sentences.

00:27:52,342 --> 00:27:53,510
You have nothing to lose.

00:27:53,576 --> 00:27:56,546
Of course I do, Professor,
because when I took

00:27:56,613 --> 00:28:00,050
those women,
they stopped being somebody's...

00:28:00,116 --> 00:28:01,518
girlfriend or...

00:28:01,584 --> 00:28:03,720
sister or...

00:28:03,787 --> 00:28:05,388
daughter...

00:28:05,455 --> 00:28:07,724
or fiancÃ©e.

00:28:07,791 --> 00:28:09,893
They became
what I wanted them to be.

00:28:10,927 --> 00:28:12,562
They're mine.

00:28:12,629 --> 00:28:14,264
Did any of them resist?

00:28:16,199 --> 00:28:18,601
No one tried to escape
or fight back?

00:28:20,503 --> 00:28:25,408
Tiffany and Cynthia
fought a little... at first.

00:28:25,475 --> 00:28:27,477
(Langston clears throat)
Um...

00:28:28,511 --> 00:28:29,979
How did you control them?

00:28:31,781 --> 00:28:33,683
Not with force.

00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:36,653
I'm gonna return to
the Jewish theme here, Doctor,

00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,887
although I want you to know

00:28:37,954 --> 00:28:40,757
that I have also killed
Catholics and Protestants

00:28:40,824 --> 00:28:42,692
and one atheist.

00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:47,597
By the way,
they all prayed eventually.

00:28:47,664 --> 00:28:50,900
Anyway, during the Holocaust,

00:28:50,967 --> 00:28:53,303
when the first arrivals
at the death camps

00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:55,005
realized they were going
to be killed,

00:28:55,071 --> 00:28:59,609
they flew into a panic,
so the guards-- the Nazis--

00:28:59,676 --> 00:29:02,712
started telling them that they
were going to be put to work,

00:29:02,779 --> 00:29:05,215
that their skills
were going to be used,

00:29:05,281 --> 00:29:07,183
and they all calmed down.

00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:11,287
And they all marched obediently
into the showers.

00:29:13,656 --> 00:29:16,326
You have to give them hope.

00:29:16,393 --> 00:29:19,696
If you bring a human being
to the brink of death,

00:29:19,763 --> 00:29:23,400
and then you offer a chance--

00:29:23,466 --> 00:29:27,470
no matter how small a chance--
to survive,

00:29:27,537 --> 00:29:29,172
they'll grab it.

00:29:29,239 --> 00:29:31,941
And they'll thank you for it.

00:29:32,008 --> 00:29:34,044
And then...

00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:36,680
you can do whatever you want.

00:29:38,715 --> 00:29:40,450
And believe me...

00:29:40,517 --> 00:29:42,986
I did.

00:29:43,053 --> 00:29:45,055
(phone ringing)

00:29:47,223 --> 00:29:48,625
Langston.

00:29:48,692 --> 00:29:50,326
Hello, warden,
thank you for calling.

00:29:50,393 --> 00:29:52,162
Am I making you proud of me?

00:29:52,228 --> 00:29:54,297
Thank you.

00:29:54,364 --> 00:29:57,167
Okay, that's it for today.

00:29:57,233 --> 00:29:58,735
See you tomorrow.

00:29:58,802 --> 00:30:00,704
Be careful out there.

00:30:08,078 --> 00:30:09,846
(quiet murmuring)

00:30:09,913 --> 00:30:11,581
Could I buy you a drink?

00:30:13,249 --> 00:30:15,452
Definitely.

00:30:17,921 --> 00:30:21,224
(rock music playing,
crowd cheering)

00:30:24,828 --> 00:30:27,063
SANDERS:
So, all these videos are
from the Paramore show

00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:29,232
the night after Justine
and Ian were killed?

00:30:30,367 --> 00:30:32,702
Got to love
the Internet.

00:30:32,769 --> 00:30:36,172
The vics' tickets
were in section 203...

00:30:36,239 --> 00:30:39,609
seats M26 and 28.

00:30:39,676 --> 00:30:41,611
And this video...

00:30:41,678 --> 00:30:44,414
has the best view
of those seats.

00:30:46,116 --> 00:30:48,618
Looks like they have
the same logos

00:30:48,685 --> 00:30:49,753
on their ball caps.

00:30:49,819 --> 00:30:50,820
I'll enhance that.

00:30:53,089 --> 00:30:54,991
Reliant Wash and Wax.

00:30:55,058 --> 00:30:56,526
MAN:
<i>Uh, yeah, I recognize them.</i>

00:30:56,593 --> 00:30:58,361
That's Richie and Donny--
they're in the tunnel.

00:30:58,428 --> 00:30:59,462
Yeah, okay.
Yeah.

00:30:59,529 --> 00:31:01,264
All right,
shut the machine down.
Okay.

00:31:01,331 --> 00:31:03,433
Go in the west entrance.

00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,502
Buckle up these two guys.

00:31:07,971 --> 00:31:09,906
Las Vegas Police!

00:31:11,708 --> 00:31:13,076
Las Vegas Police.

00:31:13,143 --> 00:31:15,178
Put your hands on the hood.

00:31:15,245 --> 00:31:17,580
Put your hands on the hood
where I can see them.

00:31:17,647 --> 00:31:19,649
(grunting)

00:31:22,419 --> 00:31:24,354
BRASS:
Okay, here's
a simple quiz.

00:31:24,421 --> 00:31:26,990
The Paramore concert
five weeks ago.

00:31:27,057 --> 00:31:28,124
Where'd you get the tickets?

00:31:28,191 --> 00:31:30,193
I told you not to do it,
you idiot.

00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,561
I got them off a scalper.

00:31:31,628 --> 00:31:32,996
That's not illegal--
it's the scalping them

00:31:33,063 --> 00:31:34,230
that's illegal.
Shut up.

00:31:34,297 --> 00:31:35,732
I don't know what this
guy's talking...

00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:37,434
coming in here...
What the scalper look like?

00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,835
I don't know, it was dark.

00:31:38,902 --> 00:31:41,137
It was in a
parking lot.

00:31:41,204 --> 00:31:43,773
Some skinny white dude, man.

00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,008
Well, that's a big help.

00:31:45,075 --> 00:31:46,843
Any chance either of you
have the ticket stub?

00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:48,378
Yeah, I do.

00:31:48,445 --> 00:31:50,180
It's in my wallet.

00:31:53,216 --> 00:31:54,351
What is this,
a phone book?

00:31:54,417 --> 00:31:56,353
Yeah, I keep
everything.

00:33:48,881 --> 00:33:52,852
So, I hear you've been
going back to school.

00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:54,888
Sort of.

00:33:54,954 --> 00:33:56,890
I loved college.

00:33:56,956 --> 00:33:58,157
Me, too.

00:34:00,627 --> 00:34:02,629
Green Bottle Blow Fly.

00:34:02,695 --> 00:34:04,197
These typically pupate
in about two weeks

00:34:04,264 --> 00:34:07,133
and emerge as
adults in four.

00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,738
The AC on in the trailer
slows down the timeline a bit.

00:34:11,804 --> 00:34:15,241
He's been dead at least a month.

00:34:15,308 --> 00:34:18,378
You're going to miss this,
you are.

00:34:18,444 --> 00:34:21,881
There's bugs everywhere, David.

00:34:21,948 --> 00:34:24,784
I will miss you, though.

00:34:43,236 --> 00:34:45,939
Hey, Nicky, he's got
Pirellis in the front

00:34:46,005 --> 00:34:49,342
and Michelins in the rear.

00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:51,744
Consistent
with the tire treads found

00:34:51,811 --> 00:34:54,347
at the Justine Stefani
murder scene.

00:34:54,414 --> 00:34:56,115
That's great but unfortunately,
his shoes were not.

00:34:56,182 --> 00:34:58,751
None of these
treads match.

00:34:58,818 --> 00:35:01,387
So, Curtis must've
been the wheel man.

00:35:01,454 --> 00:35:03,957
At least we got half the team
that killed Ian and Justine.

00:35:04,023 --> 00:35:06,960
Yeah, it's the half
that's out there

00:35:07,026 --> 00:35:09,028
walking around
that I'm worried about.

00:35:09,095 --> 00:35:10,830
GREG:
So, six
months ago,

00:35:10,897 --> 00:35:12,699
Shoe Print Man
kills Gerald Tolliver,

00:35:12,765 --> 00:35:14,834
an accomplice of
the Dick and Jane Killer.

00:35:14,901 --> 00:35:16,035
CATHERINE:
And then,
five weeks ago,

00:35:16,102 --> 00:35:18,371
Shoe Print, along
with Curtis Keesey,

00:35:18,438 --> 00:35:22,408
abducts and kills
a couple in what appears

00:35:22,475 --> 00:35:25,712
to be a botched
DJK-style murder.

00:35:25,778 --> 00:35:27,947
Can we connect Shoe Print

00:35:28,014 --> 00:35:31,150
with the murder
of Curtis Keesey?

00:35:31,217 --> 00:35:32,285
There's no physical evidence.

00:35:32,352 --> 00:35:34,621
But we do know
that Curtis scalped

00:35:34,687 --> 00:35:37,523
his vics' concert tickets,
which isn't too bright.

00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:39,392
Reason enough for one crook
to kill another.

00:35:39,459 --> 00:35:41,694
So, let's assume that Shoe Print

00:35:41,761 --> 00:35:44,163
was involved in
all four murders.

00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:46,666
It's possible he
knew Gerald, right?

00:35:46,733 --> 00:35:49,035
Is it also possible that he
was an accomplice of DJK?

00:35:49,102 --> 00:35:50,870
GREG:
That would explain

00:35:50,937 --> 00:35:54,040
the nine post-mortem
stab wounds in Ian Wallace.

00:35:54,107 --> 00:35:56,876
It's a continuation
of the master's work.

00:35:56,943 --> 00:35:58,845
But if he was DJK's
helper back in the day,

00:35:58,912 --> 00:36:01,214
why go quiet

00:36:01,281 --> 00:36:03,716
for ten years and then
suddenly start killing again?

00:36:03,783 --> 00:36:05,718
Maybe he was doing time.

00:36:05,785 --> 00:36:08,388
And when he realized
that his old partner

00:36:08,454 --> 00:36:12,392
turned informant, he got
scared and killed him.

00:36:12,458 --> 00:36:14,561
Maybe that's what brought
the old thrill back.

00:36:14,627 --> 00:36:17,063
Once these guys get a taste,
it never seems to go away.

00:36:19,332 --> 00:36:21,267
So, we've been talking a lot
about how you did what you did.

00:36:21,334 --> 00:36:22,735
Let's shift gears from
what you did right,

00:36:22,802 --> 00:36:24,737
to what you did wrong.

00:36:24,804 --> 00:36:26,573
Do you mean in a Ten
Commandments sense?

00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:28,174
I mean in how you got caught.

00:36:28,241 --> 00:36:30,843
That's the least
exciting part of the story.

00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:32,211
Yeah, but didn't you want it?

00:36:32,278 --> 00:36:33,446
Didn't you want
to get caught?

00:36:33,513 --> 00:36:35,248
Why would I want that?

00:36:35,315 --> 00:36:37,584
You were caught
because a rookie patrolman

00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:40,687
spotted blood
on your car, correct?

00:36:40,753 --> 00:36:42,055
For a careful man,

00:36:42,121 --> 00:36:43,656
that seems a
little careless.

00:36:43,723 --> 00:36:45,024
Everybody makes mistakes.

00:36:45,091 --> 00:36:46,593
Not someone like you.

00:36:46,659 --> 00:36:48,261
Not a mistake like that.

00:36:48,328 --> 00:36:50,330
I'm flattered you
think so highly of me.

00:36:50,396 --> 00:36:52,732
Any other questions?
Anybody else?

00:36:52,799 --> 00:36:55,401
Mr. Haskell, you're of
average height and weight.

00:36:55,468 --> 00:36:57,103
And not overly muscular.

00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:59,539
I try to watch what I eat.

00:36:59,606 --> 00:37:01,774
In jail, that takes more
strength than you would know.

00:37:01,841 --> 00:37:05,111
A few of your male victims
were pretty big.

00:37:05,178 --> 00:37:07,313
One even played
college football.

00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:10,550
How were you able to
overpower a man like that,

00:37:10,617 --> 00:37:12,585
while still keeping
control of the woman?

00:37:12,652 --> 00:37:14,587
Why don't you tell me,
Professor?

00:37:14,654 --> 00:37:16,222
You obviously have a theory.

00:37:16,289 --> 00:37:18,424
Well, I think you
must've had help.

00:37:18,491 --> 00:37:20,526
The works of great men
can be hard to comprehend

00:37:20,593 --> 00:37:21,794
for those less great.

00:37:21,861 --> 00:37:23,830
You said you were going
to be honest with us.

00:37:23,897 --> 00:37:26,432
Now, answer the question.
Did you have help or not?

00:37:26,499 --> 00:37:28,368
Well, let me think.

00:37:28,434 --> 00:37:31,104
With Melanie, it was just
me and the baseball bat.

00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:34,641
With Kristin, when I
cut off her right breast,

00:37:34,707 --> 00:37:36,509
that was just me.

00:37:36,576 --> 00:37:39,145
When I crushed Joel's neck

00:37:39,212 --> 00:37:43,783
and felt his veins burst under
my fingers like rotten grapes,

00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:45,852
and watched his throat
fill up with blood,

00:37:45,919 --> 00:37:47,654
I didn't have
any help there, either.

00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,322
MRS. STEINER:
Where is he, you monster!

00:37:49,389 --> 00:37:50,957
Where is my Joel?
Where is he?!

00:37:51,891 --> 00:37:53,293
Oh, I think I hit a nerve.

00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:54,861
You tell me where he is!

00:37:54,928 --> 00:37:57,030
Can I think about that
and get back to you?

00:37:57,096 --> 00:38:00,300
Okay, I thought about it,
I'm not going to tell you.

00:38:00,366 --> 00:38:01,301
(whimpering):
Oh, please tell me...

00:38:01,367 --> 00:38:02,669
Don't give him the satisfaction.

00:38:04,837 --> 00:38:08,942
HASKELL:
Joel was the first.

00:38:09,008 --> 00:38:11,110
Joel is in the perfect place,
the place where it all began.

00:38:11,177 --> 00:38:13,580
And if I could get
out of here, believe me,

00:38:13,646 --> 00:38:14,881
I would bring him some company.

00:38:14,948 --> 00:38:18,318
GRISSOM:
Mr. Haskell, we know
that you had accomplices.

00:38:18,384 --> 00:38:21,221
If you were to reveal
who they were,

00:38:21,287 --> 00:38:22,789
it might get you
out of keep-away.

00:38:22,855 --> 00:38:26,859
Oh, how nice
that we have a member

00:38:26,926 --> 00:38:29,462
of the law enforcement
community with us today.

00:38:29,529 --> 00:38:33,066
For you real students
who don't know, "keep-away"

00:38:33,132 --> 00:38:35,902
is what they call the kind
of solitary confinement I'm in.

00:38:35,969 --> 00:38:36,903
Kill the feed.

00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:38,538
It's kind of funny, don't you--

00:38:44,444 --> 00:38:46,613
You hijacked my class
without my consent

00:38:46,679 --> 00:38:48,648
for your investigation?!

00:38:48,715 --> 00:38:50,483
We're working
a multiple homicide.

00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:52,185
We didn't want to talk about it
outside the department.

00:38:52,252 --> 00:38:54,387
You talked to the Dean.

00:38:54,454 --> 00:38:56,189
Well, it was on a
need-to-know basis

00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:58,324
and he had a
need to know.

00:38:58,391 --> 00:39:00,059
Look, I don't teach this course

00:39:00,126 --> 00:39:03,196
because I get off
on the subject matter.

00:39:03,263 --> 00:39:05,431
If there's another DJK out
there, I want him just as bad

00:39:05,498 --> 00:39:06,466
as you do.
I would've helped.

00:39:06,532 --> 00:39:07,667
I would've been
happy to help you.

00:39:07,734 --> 00:39:09,435
I'm sure that's true.

00:39:09,502 --> 00:39:12,906
You believe DJK
had an accomplice?

00:39:12,972 --> 00:39:14,207
I do.

00:39:14,274 --> 00:39:15,408
Do you have a name?

00:39:15,475 --> 00:39:17,443
Not yet.

00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:18,711
Okay, now we're all up to speed.

00:39:18,778 --> 00:39:20,680
Doctor...

00:39:20,747 --> 00:39:23,049
I will keep you informed.

00:39:23,116 --> 00:39:25,118
To the extent that we can.

00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:28,454
Thanks. I know a kiss-off
when I hear one.

00:39:28,521 --> 00:39:31,591
(sighs): A little cranky
for an academic, isn't he?

00:39:31,658 --> 00:39:35,161
Actually, he's an M.D.
from back East.

00:39:35,228 --> 00:39:37,363
A colleague at his hospital

00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:39,432
turned out to be
an Angel of Death.

00:39:39,499 --> 00:39:41,801
Killed 27 patients
before he was caught.

00:39:41,868 --> 00:39:44,837
Langston was the staff
research pathologist.

00:39:44,904 --> 00:39:47,440
All the morbidity evidence
came across his desk,

00:39:47,507 --> 00:39:49,108
but he was unable
to connect the dots.

00:39:49,175 --> 00:39:51,911
He wrote a book
about it.
Any good?

00:39:51,978 --> 00:39:53,913
I liked it.

00:39:55,515 --> 00:40:00,353
(phone ringing)

00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:01,854
This is Langston.

00:40:01,921 --> 00:40:05,391
Working late? I kind of thought
you might be.

00:40:05,458 --> 00:40:06,893
Haskell.

00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,797
Uh-huh. This must
be my lucky night.

00:40:10,863 --> 00:40:13,199
Maybe it's yours, too.

00:40:13,266 --> 00:40:15,401
What do you want?

00:40:15,468 --> 00:40:18,738
I want you to look
out the window.

00:40:18,805 --> 00:40:20,807
Why?

00:40:20,873 --> 00:40:23,676
Because I'm in the parking lot.

00:40:34,153 --> 00:40:36,756
(Haskell chuckling)

00:40:36,823 --> 00:40:40,159
I made you look.

00:40:40,226 --> 00:40:41,995
Is that why you called?

00:40:42,061 --> 00:40:44,130
No, I wanted to talk to you

00:40:44,197 --> 00:40:48,134
about what happened in class
today-- with Mrs. Steiner.

00:40:48,201 --> 00:40:51,371
Sure, just, uh,
hold on a second.

00:40:51,437 --> 00:40:54,440
Let me close the door.

00:41:01,114 --> 00:41:04,517
(phone ringing)

00:41:04,584 --> 00:41:06,352
Grissom.

00:41:06,419 --> 00:41:09,322
Ray Langston. I have
Nate Haskell on the phone.

00:41:09,389 --> 00:41:11,791
He wants to talk about what
happened with Mrs. Steiner.

00:41:11,858 --> 00:41:13,893
I'd like to put you
on the other line.

00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,728
Go ahead.

00:41:17,764 --> 00:41:19,732
Haskell, are you there?

00:41:19,799 --> 00:41:21,801
I'm sure we're all here now.

00:41:21,868 --> 00:41:24,571
What I learned in class today,

00:41:24,637 --> 00:41:27,006
as I was looking out at all
those scared little faces

00:41:27,073 --> 00:41:28,741
who couldn't take
their eyes off of me,

00:41:28,808 --> 00:41:32,178
was how much I miss
being out in the world.

00:41:32,245 --> 00:41:36,683
And when Mrs. Steiner
had her "moment,"

00:41:36,749 --> 00:41:40,887
it got me thinking
about... closure.

00:41:40,954 --> 00:41:42,722
Which is what you'll find

00:41:42,789 --> 00:41:46,059
at the corner of Boulder
Highway and Hasbrook.

00:41:46,125 --> 00:41:49,829
<i>It's just another empty</i>
<i>stretch of desert out there.</i>

00:41:49,896 --> 00:41:53,766
<i>At least it was ten years ago.</i>

00:41:53,833 --> 00:41:58,004
<i>The way this city's changed,</i>
<i>it's maybe all different now.</i>

00:41:58,071 --> 00:42:01,074
<i>Although, maybe not.</i>

00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:03,476
<i>It's kind of an ugly place.</i>

00:42:03,543 --> 00:42:08,047
<i>Anyway, it's just the</i>
<i>same in my imagination.</i>

00:42:08,114 --> 00:42:12,919
<i>There's a concrete bridge</i>
<i>built in 1938.</i>

00:42:12,986 --> 00:42:17,423
<i>You can tell because the</i>
<i>year is stamped in the front.</i>

00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:22,328
<i>25 feet from that, look west.</i>

00:42:22,395 --> 00:42:25,498
<i>You'll see one dark stone</i>

00:42:25,565 --> 00:42:29,335
<i>that just doesn't</i>
<i>quit fit with the rest.</i>

00:42:30,737 --> 00:42:33,840
<i>Under there...</i>

00:42:33,907 --> 00:42:36,676
<i>that's where you'll find Joel.</i>

00:42:40,246 --> 00:42:43,016
<i>And if we're lucky,</i>
<i>maybe something else.</i>

00:42:43,082 --> 00:42:45,184
Grissom, we got
something here!

00:42:54,627 --> 00:42:57,463
<i>Because that's the problem</i>
<i>with closure.</i>

00:42:57,530 --> 00:43:01,100
<i>Sometimes when</i>
<i>something closes,</i>

00:43:01,167 --> 00:43:04,837
<i>something else opens up.</i>

00:43:09,375 --> 00:43:11,311
Guess you won't be
leaving just yet.
