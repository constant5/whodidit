I meant I.D. overload.

00:03:01,831 --> 00:03:03,433
Must have been at least
a dozen people

Officers have been unable

what happened.

00:06:12,174 --> 00:06:13,909
It's not my business,

00:06:13,976 --> 00:06:15,945

flapping about it.

00:06:16,011 --> 00:06:18,180
So you think
that's real, too,

00:06:18,247 --> 00:06:20,249
letting murderers
run free?

00:06:22,451 --> 00:06:24,987

a gang thing.

00:06:26,822 --> 00:06:28,724

ROBBINS:
Male C.O.D. is exsanguinations

Exsanguinations due

00:06:39,502 --> 00:06:42,471
The bullets in the male
were cannelured.

00:06:42,538 --> 00:06:44,273
He was shot with a revolver.

00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:47,376
Female was shot twice
with a semiautomatic.

00:06:47,443 --> 00:06:49,912
Two guns, two killers?

00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:52,047
Or one killer, two guns,
gangsta style.

00:06:52,114 --> 00:06:55,885
Well, his shots seem
fairly straight and level,

00:06:55,951 --> 00:06:57,520
but it looks like
the bullets entered her

00:06:57,586 --> 00:06:59,755
at a much steeper trajectory.

00:06:59,822 --> 00:07:00,923
Yeah, approximately
20 degrees up,

00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:02,658
front to back.

00:07:02,725 --> 00:07:04,093
So, what,

00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,061
He gets gunned down,
she's terrified,

00:07:06,128 --> 00:07:07,329
tries to flee

00:07:07,396 --> 00:07:09,632
<i>and then falls down </i>
<i>as she's shot,</i>

00:07:09,698 --> 00:07:12,434
<i>exaggerating the trajectory?</i>

00:07:15,237 --> 00:07:16,505
Could be a drug thing.

00:07:18,874 --> 00:07:21,777
She's got the needle marks
to prove it.

00:07:23,145 --> 00:07:25,614
I sent blood and tissue samples
to Tox.

00:07:28,317 --> 00:07:31,220
GRISSOM:
This is an odd-looking scar...

00:07:31,287 --> 00:07:33,322
on both eyelids.

00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:34,957
Could be cosmetic
surgery.

00:07:35,024 --> 00:07:37,026
She's a little young
for a facelift,

00:07:37,092 --> 00:07:38,194
don't you think?

00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,830
GRISSOM:
Attractive girl on drugs,

00:07:40,896 --> 00:07:44,700
on the street with an ex-con
and no I.D.

00:07:44,767 --> 00:07:46,635
Sounds like a street hooker.

00:07:46,702 --> 00:07:50,639
Yeah, but not someone
who pays for plastic surgery.

00:07:50,706 --> 00:07:52,441
ROBBINS: Well, maybe it's
a business investment,

00:07:52,508 --> 00:07:54,110
courtesy of her pimp.

00:07:54,176 --> 00:07:57,847
ADAMS: So he's unmarried
with no children

00:07:57,913 --> 00:07:59,815
and apart from the DUIs,
clean record.

00:07:59,882 --> 00:08:01,951
No known gang affiliation.

00:08:02,017 --> 00:08:04,653
He was at Dempsey's
Department Store

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,755
a half an hour
before he was shot

00:08:06,822 --> 00:08:11,727
and was released from Jean
an hour before that.

00:08:11,794 --> 00:08:15,582
Jean is a 45-minute bus ride
to Vegas.

00:08:15,582 --> 00:08:17,785
So this guy gets
out of jail

00:08:17,785 --> 00:08:22,881
and in under the running time
of <i>The Godfather,</i> he's dead.

00:08:24,925 --> 00:08:27,561
Well, a lot of people die
at the end of <i>Godfather.</i>

00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,442
Riley ran all the bullets
and casings from the scene.

00:08:35,509 --> 00:08:36,977
Gun is clean.

00:08:37,044 --> 00:08:38,378
Any I.D.
on the female?

00:08:38,445 --> 00:08:41,748
No, but she had
a blepharoplasty.

00:08:41,815 --> 00:08:44,084
Asian eyelid procedure
fairly common in Korea

00:08:44,151 --> 00:08:45,519
and apparently catching
on here, too.

00:08:45,585 --> 00:08:48,355
Brass passed the vic's photo
around Makeover Town.

00:08:48,422 --> 00:08:50,190
Makeover Town? L.A.?

00:08:50,257 --> 00:08:53,327
No, it's a block
of plastic surgeons
in our Koreatown.

00:08:53,393 --> 00:08:55,329
Our Koreatown
<i>is</i> a block.

00:08:55,395 --> 00:08:57,731
Maybe that's why
he was able to
find a doctor.

00:08:57,798 --> 00:09:00,867
MAN:
<i>I didn't know her name.</i>

00:09:00,934 --> 00:09:02,436
BRASS:
<i>You put a woman</i>
<i>under anesthesia,</i>

00:09:02,502 --> 00:09:04,871
<i>you cut her open,</i>
<i>and you don't know her name?</i>

00:09:04,938 --> 00:09:06,873
<i>Sir, she was not</i>
<i>an ordinary client.</i>

00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,275
So they forced you
at gunpoint

00:09:08,342 --> 00:09:09,943
to perform eye surgery on women

00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:13,780
in a procedure that Westernizes
their appearance,

00:09:13,847 --> 00:09:15,449
resulting in an effect
called "round eyes"?

00:09:15,515 --> 00:09:16,717
Ever since Jackie Chan

00:09:16,783 --> 00:09:19,119
got his eyes done,
the surgery's

00:09:19,186 --> 00:09:20,687
been very popular.

00:09:20,754 --> 00:09:22,089
And then they just left?

00:09:22,155 --> 00:09:24,224
Yes, after they forced me

00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:26,593
to agree to give them
15% of my profits.

00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,928
I'm gonna need names, Doctor.

00:09:27,995 --> 00:09:29,830
They didn't leave
any business cards.

00:09:32,299 --> 00:09:35,235
I think they belong
to a group called The KD.

00:09:35,302 --> 00:09:36,737
The Kkangpae Dragons.

00:09:36,803 --> 00:09:38,171
I never heard of.

00:09:38,238 --> 00:09:40,107
And there isn't much in Vegas
I haven't heard of.

00:09:40,173 --> 00:09:41,208
A new outfit.

00:09:41,274 --> 00:09:42,542
They don't have any tattoos

00:09:42,609 --> 00:09:45,078
or drive lowriders
or spray graffiti.

00:09:45,145 --> 00:09:47,347
They don't even sell drugs.

00:09:47,414 --> 00:09:49,516
So what do they do,
just force plastic surgeons

00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:51,151
to operate on their prostitutes?

00:09:51,218 --> 00:09:54,054
Extortion is their trade.
They just take.
Right.

00:09:54,121 --> 00:09:55,389
And they take from their own

00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,623
because they know their own.

00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:58,592
They know that their own
won't turn them in.

00:09:58,659 --> 00:10:00,894
Well, you're very courageous
to come in and report this.

00:10:00,961 --> 00:10:02,863
Why won't others come forward?

00:10:02,929 --> 00:10:05,699
You want a bunch of immigrants
to come to the police?

00:10:05,766 --> 00:10:08,035
Why don't you protect them
the way you protect the tourists

00:10:08,101 --> 00:10:10,771
on the Strip and the big shots
in Anthem and Seven Hills?

00:10:10,837 --> 00:10:12,439
Save the stump speech
for when you run for mayor.

00:10:12,506 --> 00:10:13,974
I'll vote for you.

00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:15,609
Are you still paying extortion?

00:10:15,676 --> 00:10:17,210
No, not anymore.

00:10:17,277 --> 00:10:20,480
Six months ago,
I joined an HMO.

00:10:20,547 --> 00:10:22,516
And they installed
several security cameras

00:10:22,582 --> 00:10:24,117
around my building.

00:10:24,184 --> 00:10:26,353
The Dragons don't like
to be seen.

00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,422
They prefer to be invisible.

00:10:28,488 --> 00:10:30,257
CAVALIERE:
Excuse me, Captain.

00:10:30,324 --> 00:10:31,692
We got a surveillance hit.

00:10:31,758 --> 00:10:33,293
CSI said there were
no surveillance cameras

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,628
at the crime scene.

00:10:34,695 --> 00:10:37,297
Hit didn't come from CSI.

00:10:37,364 --> 00:10:39,666
One of my video analysts
caught news of your double

00:10:39,733 --> 00:10:41,902
in Koreatown
and recognized the male vic

00:10:41,969 --> 00:10:43,804
while scanning
one of our video feeds.

00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:46,306
from a unrelated
shoplifting investigation.

00:10:46,373 --> 00:10:47,374
Wow.

00:10:47,441 --> 00:10:49,042
Video analyst?

00:10:49,109 --> 00:10:52,112
Yeah, why?
What do you call them?

00:11:00,921 --> 00:11:02,189
(keypad beeping)

00:11:02,255 --> 00:11:04,791
"Forensic Services."

00:11:08,428 --> 00:11:09,596
(Willows chuckles)

00:11:09,663 --> 00:11:12,566
Must have a hell of
a shoplifting problem.

00:11:12,633 --> 00:11:14,267
We're in a
high crime area,

00:11:14,334 --> 00:11:16,236
and this facility represents
a corporate mission

00:11:16,303 --> 00:11:19,039
to prevent theft, fraud and
personal injury in our stores.

00:11:19,106 --> 00:11:23,477
BRASS:
You're not outsourcing that
to China, too, are you?

00:11:23,543 --> 00:11:25,846
All right, Artie, bring it up.

00:11:25,912 --> 00:11:28,915
You know, what's your solve rate
on property crime these days?

00:11:28,982 --> 00:11:30,350
One in ten? One in 20?

00:11:30,417 --> 00:11:33,253
Hey, you didn't tell me
we were going to have a quiz.

00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,788
You know, we nail 93%.

00:11:34,855 --> 00:11:37,391
Nationwide, Dempsey's
Forensic Services
has put three fugitives

00:11:37,457 --> 00:11:40,594
behind bars; we're going to be
in 300 locations by next summer.

00:11:40,661 --> 00:11:41,895
BRASS:
Hey, look, you know,

00:11:41,962 --> 00:11:44,498
if it, uh, if it's legal
and makes my job easier,

00:11:44,564 --> 00:11:46,266
I'm all for it.

00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:48,201
There's our guy.

00:11:48,268 --> 00:11:49,536
Sung Bang.

00:11:49,603 --> 00:11:51,505
Archie...

00:11:51,571 --> 00:11:55,842
Artie... could you enhance
the image of the boy?

00:11:55,909 --> 00:11:58,245
(typing,
then computer trills)

00:11:58,312 --> 00:11:59,346
WILLOWS:
Wow.

00:11:59,413 --> 00:12:01,882
You've got some
really great cameras.

00:12:01,948 --> 00:12:03,417
Good as any on the Strip.

00:12:03,483 --> 00:12:05,085
In fact, our crime lab
is better equipped

00:12:05,152 --> 00:12:06,353
than most in the country.

00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:09,289
Now, that's a crime.

00:12:09,356 --> 00:12:11,124
WILLOWS: We're going
to need that toy.

00:12:11,191 --> 00:12:12,125
Mindy?

00:12:12,192 --> 00:12:13,727
The toy
and the lift.

00:12:15,796 --> 00:12:18,298
We didn't bother running it
through AFIS.

00:12:18,365 --> 00:12:19,533
He's obviously
under 14 years old,

00:12:19,599 --> 00:12:21,068
so he wouldn't be
in the database.

00:12:21,134 --> 00:12:23,603
We, uh, licensed it
from the Feds.

00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,739
Loupe, please.

00:12:25,806 --> 00:12:27,741
Thank you.

00:12:34,715 --> 00:12:36,383
This is the same boy.

00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:37,918
Is that the vic's kid?

00:12:37,985 --> 00:12:38,986
BRASS: From
everything we know,

00:12:39,052 --> 00:12:41,822
Sung Bang
had no children.

00:12:41,888 --> 00:12:43,056
He sure looks like

00:12:43,123 --> 00:12:45,492
the happy dad to me.

00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:51,727
BRASS:
This is the last footage

00:12:51,794 --> 00:12:54,253
of Sung Bang leaving
Dempsey's Department Store.

00:12:54,253 --> 00:12:55,555
Who's the kid?

00:12:55,621 --> 00:12:57,824
The boy's name
is Park Bang.

00:12:57,890 --> 00:12:59,792
Sung is his uncle.

00:12:59,859 --> 00:13:01,594
You positive?

00:13:01,661 --> 00:13:03,930
I've been Park's
CPS investigator
for over two years.

00:13:03,996 --> 00:13:05,565
I know what
he looks like.

00:13:05,631 --> 00:13:08,501
Okay. Who's this?

00:13:08,568 --> 00:13:09,869
Uh...

00:13:09,936 --> 00:13:11,938
Here. Come over
in the light.

00:13:14,107 --> 00:13:15,108
(switch clicks)

00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:20,613
Her name's Kora Sil.

00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,948
Park's mother.

00:13:22,014 --> 00:13:23,950
Poor boy has lost everyone.

00:13:24,016 --> 00:13:25,885
What about his father?
Dead.

00:13:25,952 --> 00:13:28,721
He was supposedly some big
gangster here and in Korea.

00:13:28,788 --> 00:13:30,757
The Kkangpae Dragons?

00:13:30,823 --> 00:13:33,059
I don't know.
I never actually met him.

00:13:33,126 --> 00:13:34,961
He died of AIDS a few years ago.

00:13:35,027 --> 00:13:37,396
That's when Sung took
over the father role.

00:13:37,463 --> 00:13:39,198
In fact, it was Sung
who notified us

00:13:39,265 --> 00:13:40,900
about Kora's drug use.

00:13:40,967 --> 00:13:43,035
He loved that boy.

00:13:43,102 --> 00:13:45,037
You know, CSI did
a tox panel on the mother.

00:13:45,104 --> 00:13:46,472
Came back positive
for HIV.

00:13:46,539 --> 00:13:48,207
What's the boy's status?
Do you know?

00:13:48,274 --> 00:13:50,476
He's also
HIV positive.

00:13:50,543 --> 00:13:52,512
Park's on a very strict
drug regimen,

00:13:52,578 --> 00:13:54,380
so we need
to find him immediately.

00:13:54,447 --> 00:13:55,982
Well, I mean, the drug regimen

00:13:56,048 --> 00:13:57,650
may be the least
of his problems.

00:13:57,717 --> 00:14:00,119
I think the gang
killed his uncle

00:14:00,186 --> 00:14:02,922
and his mother, he saw it;
he may already be dead.

00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:05,958
(sighs heavily)

00:14:06,025 --> 00:14:07,927
WILLOWS:
Our girl has done time.

00:14:07,994 --> 00:14:09,896
Three months for prostitution.

00:14:09,962 --> 00:14:11,330
Three months?

00:14:11,397 --> 00:14:12,832
That's pretty
harsh for Vegas.

00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:14,700
Prostitution with HIV.

00:14:14,767 --> 00:14:17,003
That's like pointing a gun
and pulling the trigger.

00:14:17,069 --> 00:14:18,438
Any last-knowns?

00:14:18,504 --> 00:14:19,772
Over a dozen.

00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,340
She's moved around a lot.

00:14:21,407 --> 00:14:24,076
PD's running them down.

00:14:24,143 --> 00:14:27,313
Kora Sil's Friend Agenda page.

00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:30,783
Single... Born in Seoul...

00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:34,921
Likes rap music...
doesn't drink or smoke...

00:14:34,987 --> 00:14:37,090
But likes to shoot drugs
and turn tricks with HIV.

00:14:37,156 --> 00:14:38,925
Well, it's always
something, isn't it?

00:14:38,991 --> 00:14:40,693
Let's check the IP address
of the last comment

00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,628
she posted.
Yeah.

00:14:49,402 --> 00:14:52,638
JOHNSON:
Well, looks like she's using
this page to score drugs.

00:14:52,705 --> 00:14:54,307
Welcome to the dark side
of social networking.

00:14:54,373 --> 00:15:00,346
JOHNSON:
Okay. The IP address... is...

00:15:03,382 --> 00:15:04,817
What a surprise.

00:15:04,884 --> 00:15:06,986
Koreatown.

00:15:07,053 --> 00:15:09,622
MAN:
<i>Of course I know Kora.</i>

00:15:09,689 --> 00:15:10,690
But why do you ask?

00:15:10,757 --> 00:15:11,958
We're looking for her son.

00:15:12,024 --> 00:15:13,793
Why would Park be here?

00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:16,095
We're going
to take a look around.

00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:18,698
That's a field I.D.

00:15:18,765 --> 00:15:21,033
We photograph every person
of interest in a case.

00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,568
It's standard procedure.

00:15:22,635 --> 00:15:24,704
I have no reason
to lie to you.

00:15:24,771 --> 00:15:25,838
I know Park and Kora.

00:15:25,905 --> 00:15:27,073
They come over
to use my computer.

00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,675
Mr. Pan, you don't strike me

00:15:29,742 --> 00:15:31,844
as the kind of guy
who would have nefarious

00:15:31,911 --> 00:15:33,880
individuals
in your home.

00:15:33,946 --> 00:15:35,314
Captain Brass,
may we talk outside?

00:15:35,381 --> 00:15:36,783
No.

00:15:39,152 --> 00:15:44,357
(speaking Korean)

00:15:44,424 --> 00:15:47,927
I've known Park's father
his entire life.

00:15:47,994 --> 00:15:49,762
We came over
from Korea together,

00:15:49,829 --> 00:15:51,431
but we went
in different directions.

00:15:51,497 --> 00:15:53,433
But I still treat his family
as my own, and

00:15:53,499 --> 00:15:55,368
if they want to use my computer,
I let them.

00:15:55,435 --> 00:15:56,969
There's nothing
wrong with that.

00:15:57,036 --> 00:15:58,204
No, I'll tell you
what's wrong.

00:15:58,271 --> 00:15:59,505
The young woman
Kora is dead,

00:15:59,572 --> 00:16:00,873
and her son Park
is missing.

00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,275
Now, this
crime happened

00:16:02,341 --> 00:16:04,577
about a block
from where you live.

00:16:04,644 --> 00:16:06,679
I can't believe you
haven't heard about this.

00:16:06,746 --> 00:16:10,249
I had no idea.
I was in Phoenix on business.

00:16:10,316 --> 00:16:12,218
Oh. Phoenix, huh?
House is clear, sir.

00:16:12,285 --> 00:16:14,153
Thanks, Kwan.

00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,022
Do you have any idea
where Park might be?

00:16:16,089 --> 00:16:19,725
No. No. I don't know.
I... I'm truly sorry.

00:16:19,792 --> 00:16:22,428
Okay, look.
Here's my card.

00:16:22,495 --> 00:16:24,397
Call me if you hear
or see anything

00:16:24,464 --> 00:16:26,632
that may be
useful to me.

00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:28,868
Thanks for your cooperation.

00:16:28,935 --> 00:16:31,070
Sorry for the inconvenience.

00:16:36,175 --> 00:16:39,779
Park Bang left
Dempsey's Department Store

00:16:39,846 --> 00:16:41,981
at around 4:00 p.m. with
a shopping bag full of stuff

00:16:42,048 --> 00:16:43,149
his uncle just bought him.

00:16:43,216 --> 00:16:45,585
The shooting occurred here

00:16:45,651 --> 00:16:46,586
about a half
an hour later,

00:16:46,652 --> 00:16:47,720
and that's
only a couple

00:16:47,787 --> 00:16:49,422
blocks away;
the uncle doesn't have

00:16:49,489 --> 00:16:50,790
a car, so...

00:16:50,857 --> 00:16:52,725
they probably walked,

00:16:52,792 --> 00:16:55,862
using one of these routes.

00:16:58,531 --> 00:17:00,466
What's on that receipt again?

00:17:00,533 --> 00:17:01,634
Uh... T-shirt,

00:17:01,701 --> 00:17:03,436
novelty sunglasses, Crunchies,

00:17:03,503 --> 00:17:05,938
Double Fudge, Fruit Funzies

00:17:06,005 --> 00:17:07,306
and Nutty Cups.
Nothing says

00:17:07,373 --> 00:17:08,975
"I love you"
like processed sugar.

00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:14,046
The only thing we found at
the scene were the sunglasses.

00:17:14,113 --> 00:17:16,382
Where's the rest of it?

00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,622
STOKES:
Okay, we're digging
through trash.

00:17:22,688 --> 00:17:25,124
More specifically, anything
from Dempsey's Department Store.

00:17:25,191 --> 00:17:27,059
Clothing tags,
assorted candy items.

00:17:27,126 --> 00:17:29,495
Okay? Check the cans,
the Dumpsters,

00:17:29,562 --> 00:17:32,165
sewage drains,
Port-a-Potties.

00:17:32,231 --> 00:17:34,133
Okay, be thorough.

00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,701
Yeah, let's do it.

00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:42,141
Remember to check
along the fences, under cars.

00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:45,211
These are places
where evidence can hide.

00:17:45,278 --> 00:17:47,814
Use your imagination.

00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,416
STOKES:
I know this seems
like a simple trash hunt,

00:17:50,483 --> 00:17:52,185
but it could make
or break the case.

00:17:52,251 --> 00:17:53,286
The sooner
we find the stuff,

00:17:53,352 --> 00:17:55,555
the sooner we're
going to find this kid,

00:17:55,621 --> 00:17:57,356
so don't be afraid
to get your hands dirty.

00:17:57,423 --> 00:17:59,926
Hodges.

00:18:01,494 --> 00:18:02,628
Come on, man.
I know you're not nuts

00:18:02,695 --> 00:18:03,763
about the field,
but I didn't bring you

00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,598
all the way out here
to just stand around.

00:18:05,665 --> 00:18:06,933
You know what I mean?

00:18:06,999 --> 00:18:08,301
Can I see you for a second?

00:18:11,904 --> 00:18:14,107
What?

00:18:14,173 --> 00:18:18,111
You can work hard
or you can work smart.

00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,251
Can I go now?

00:18:34,594 --> 00:18:35,862
(knocking on door)

00:18:35,928 --> 00:18:37,563
LVPD! Open up!

00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:38,598
(door bursts open)

00:18:38,664 --> 00:18:41,234
(people chattering in Korean
on TV)

00:18:45,738 --> 00:18:47,073
(yelling in Korean)

00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,441
Sorry to barge in on you, ma'am.

00:18:48,508 --> 00:18:50,143
We're just looking
for a missing little boy.

00:18:50,209 --> 00:18:52,111
ADAMS:
Gun!

00:18:52,178 --> 00:18:53,813
She's got a gun!

00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,314
Nick, she's
got a gun.

00:18:55,381 --> 00:18:56,382
What are you doing?
Put that thing down.

00:18:56,449 --> 00:18:58,484
(yelling in Korean)

00:18:58,551 --> 00:19:00,153
Lady, put that
gun down right now.

00:19:00,219 --> 00:19:01,154
Put the gun down

00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,155
or we'll shoot.

00:19:02,221 --> 00:19:03,923
No, we won't. Relax.

00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:06,392
Ma'am, we're looking
for a little boy

00:19:06,459 --> 00:19:07,760
who's in really
big trouble.

00:19:07,827 --> 00:19:09,061
His name
is Park Bang.

00:19:09,128 --> 00:19:10,329
(yelling in Korean)

00:19:10,396 --> 00:19:11,731
She doesn't understand.

00:19:11,798 --> 00:19:13,633
Where the hell
is the translator?!

00:19:13,699 --> 00:19:15,234
She understands just fine.
Don't you?

00:19:15,301 --> 00:19:16,602
Park Bang.

00:19:16,669 --> 00:19:19,639
We just want to help him.
She doesn't understand.

00:19:19,705 --> 00:19:22,108
(yelling in Korean)

00:19:22,175 --> 00:19:23,776
Drop the gun! Nick!

00:19:23,843 --> 00:19:25,812
(speaking Korean)

00:19:27,914 --> 00:19:31,984
(boy speaking Korean)

00:19:32,051 --> 00:19:36,322
(boy speaking Korean)

00:19:36,389 --> 00:19:39,292
(speaking Korean)

00:20:04,493 --> 00:20:06,962
Riley. What's the deal?

00:20:07,029 --> 00:20:09,598
(sighs)
Kid's pretty weak.

00:20:09,665 --> 00:20:11,500
I asked him if he remembered
anything about the shootings,

00:20:11,567 --> 00:20:13,001
but he wouldn't
even open his mouth.

00:20:13,068 --> 00:20:15,337
Where is his
CPS investigator?

00:20:15,404 --> 00:20:16,805
En route.

00:20:16,872 --> 00:20:20,776
You interviewed a minor
without an advocate present?

00:20:20,843 --> 00:20:23,145
Not officially.

00:20:23,212 --> 00:20:24,480
Those regulations are there

00:20:24,546 --> 00:20:25,481
to protect the welfare
of the child.

00:20:25,547 --> 00:20:26,682
Don't ever do that again.

00:20:26,748 --> 00:20:28,851
Look, I didn't
do anything wrong.

00:20:28,917 --> 00:20:30,586
I was just trying
to help our case.

00:20:30,652 --> 00:20:32,654
Maybe you should
go back to the lab.

00:20:32,721 --> 00:20:34,723
Happy to.

00:20:38,861 --> 00:20:41,296
Okay, let's get
that shirt off.

00:20:41,363 --> 00:20:43,365
Sit up
a little bit. Okay.

00:20:50,773 --> 00:20:52,541
Good job.

00:20:57,479 --> 00:20:59,448
GRISSOM:
Excuse me, Doctor.

00:20:59,515 --> 00:21:02,317
I'm with the Las Vegas
Police Department.

00:21:02,384 --> 00:21:05,587
Why does this boy
have a gastric tube?

00:21:05,654 --> 00:21:08,090
Might be an issue
with feeding.

00:21:08,157 --> 00:21:09,892
Trouble swallowing,
that sort of thing.

00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:10,959
We'll do a chest X-ray

00:21:11,026 --> 00:21:12,928
to be sure.

00:21:12,995 --> 00:21:14,096
What about this
skin condition?

00:21:14,163 --> 00:21:18,066
Yeah, probably a side effect
of his HIV meds.

00:21:18,133 --> 00:21:20,669
CPS sent
his records over.

00:21:20,736 --> 00:21:23,906
He's on a pretty
severe regimen.

00:21:23,972 --> 00:21:26,275
Why is there dried blood

00:21:26,341 --> 00:21:28,010
around the feeding tube?
He could have caught it

00:21:28,076 --> 00:21:29,812
on something--
tried to pull it out.

00:21:29,878 --> 00:21:31,146
Hey, kiddo,

00:21:31,213 --> 00:21:33,415
I'm going to take
good care of you,

00:21:33,482 --> 00:21:34,883
don't worry.

00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:36,952
(raspy breathing)

00:21:39,721 --> 00:21:41,957
(three gunshots)

00:21:42,024 --> 00:21:43,926
(woman speaking Korean)

00:21:43,992 --> 00:21:46,261
OFFICER KWAN:
<i>She says that she was just</i>
<i>watering her garden</i>

00:21:46,328 --> 00:21:48,797
<i>when she heard gunshots</i>
<i>and people started running.</i>

00:21:48,864 --> 00:21:53,001
(crowd screaming,
shrieking)

00:21:53,068 --> 00:21:55,070
(speaking Korean)

00:22:00,442 --> 00:22:01,877
She took the boy in

00:22:01,944 --> 00:22:06,215
and fed him and let him
play with some old toys.

00:22:06,281 --> 00:22:11,453
(speaking Korean)

00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,088
And then the boy
went to sleep

00:22:13,155 --> 00:22:15,290
like little boys should.

00:22:15,357 --> 00:22:19,294
(speaking Korean)

00:22:19,361 --> 00:22:22,731
She says she was just trying
to protect the boy.

00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:24,833
Why'd you pull a gun
on the police?

00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,903
(translating in Korean)

00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:34,409
(replies in Korean)

00:22:34,476 --> 00:22:36,378
She says that where
she comes from,

00:22:36,445 --> 00:22:38,680
people would take care
of their neighbors.

00:22:38,747 --> 00:22:41,083
You should've turned him
over to us right away.

00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:44,486
(Kwan translating)

00:22:44,553 --> 00:22:50,826
(replies in Korean)

00:22:50,893 --> 00:22:52,694
She asks why?

00:22:52,761 --> 00:22:55,697
So you can cut another
hole in his stomach?

00:22:58,667 --> 00:23:00,869
BRASS:
Okay, then,
how about these guys?

00:23:00,936 --> 00:23:03,005
Any of these guys
look familiar, huh?

00:23:03,071 --> 00:23:05,240
Come on, Park,
you can talk to me.

00:23:05,307 --> 00:23:06,875
(Chin speaking Korean)

00:23:06,942 --> 00:23:08,377
These people are here
to help you.

00:23:08,444 --> 00:23:12,915
If you see one
that hurt your mommy or uncle,

00:23:12,981 --> 00:23:15,250
all you have to do is point,
okay, pal?

00:23:15,317 --> 00:23:17,319
Huh?

00:23:20,355 --> 00:23:21,757
Don't want to do it now?

00:23:21,824 --> 00:23:23,826
Okay, I'll tell you what,
we'll do it another time.

00:23:23,892 --> 00:23:25,094
Take care, buddy.

00:23:28,497 --> 00:23:31,733
I'm going to put some
police officers at the door.

00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:35,204
I don't think the KD
will try anything here,
but you never know.

00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:36,805
Are you finished?

00:23:36,872 --> 00:23:38,640
I still got to
collect biologicals.

00:23:38,707 --> 00:23:40,209
I'll see you later.

00:23:48,217 --> 00:23:49,718
He understands
English, right?

00:23:49,785 --> 00:23:51,153
Mm-hmm.

00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,522
Hi, Park.
My name is Gil.

00:23:53,589 --> 00:23:57,659
I'm not a doctor,
I'm not a policeman.

00:23:57,726 --> 00:23:59,595
I'm kind of a...

00:23:59,661 --> 00:24:02,297
What am I? I don't know.

00:24:02,364 --> 00:24:04,433
I mostly do a lot of thinking.

00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:08,437
But I do need to look
under your fingernails.

00:24:13,742 --> 00:24:15,944
I'm not going to grab your hand.

00:24:16,011 --> 00:24:17,179
I'll just wait here

00:24:17,246 --> 00:24:19,414
until you want to
give it to me, okay?

00:24:19,481 --> 00:24:22,985
But I promise you
it won't hurt.

00:24:33,362 --> 00:24:34,997
Thank you.

00:24:47,342 --> 00:24:48,544
Hello, Mrs. Chin.

00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:50,612
I got here as fast
as I could.

00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:52,648
Dr. Eisling, this is Mr. Grissom
from the crime lab.

00:24:52,714 --> 00:24:54,049
How do you do?

00:24:54,116 --> 00:24:55,951
Hey, Park.

00:24:56,018 --> 00:24:59,855
We're, uh... we're going
to have to give him
his medication here.

00:24:59,922 --> 00:25:01,256
(whines in protest)

00:25:01,323 --> 00:25:02,858
He doesn't seem to want it.

00:25:02,925 --> 00:25:05,527
Well, that's why we gave him
a gastric tube.

00:25:05,594 --> 00:25:06,762
Okay, now come on...

00:25:06,829 --> 00:25:08,497
No! (yelling in Korean)
Okay, come on...

00:25:08,564 --> 00:25:10,132
Can you hold him, please?

00:25:10,199 --> 00:25:14,203
I know, I know...
Okay, I know, I know.
(yelling in Korean)

00:25:14,269 --> 00:25:16,004
Come hold him.
Come hold him.

00:25:16,071 --> 00:25:18,474
Just take his arm.

00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:21,009
I know. I know.

00:25:21,076 --> 00:25:23,011
(screaming)

00:25:23,078 --> 00:25:24,713
Stay still,
Stay still.

00:25:25,881 --> 00:25:27,082
(Park screaming)

00:25:27,149 --> 00:25:29,184
EISLING:
Okay. All right.

00:25:31,353 --> 00:25:35,124
So Park was wearing the white
T-shirt during the shooting.

00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:37,526
He changed into the blue one
at the old woman's house.

00:25:37,593 --> 00:25:39,561
Threw the white one away.

00:25:39,628 --> 00:25:41,897
Makes sense. Had his mother
and his uncle's blood

00:25:41,964 --> 00:25:42,898
all over him.

00:25:42,965 --> 00:25:45,567
(two gunshots,
blood splattering)

00:25:47,469 --> 00:25:49,071
Park Bang's
tox report.

00:25:49,138 --> 00:25:51,006
Most adult cancer patients

00:25:51,073 --> 00:25:52,641
don't have this many drugs
in their systems.

00:25:52,708 --> 00:25:54,076
But an eight-year-old...?

00:25:54,143 --> 00:25:55,644
Never seen
anything like it.

00:25:55,711 --> 00:25:57,312
Most of the drugs
on that list

00:25:57,379 --> 00:25:59,548
are meant to stop cell
development, stop bone marrow

00:25:59,615 --> 00:26:02,017
from producing blood,
stop proteins from assembling.

00:26:02,084 --> 00:26:04,253
If he continues
on this regimen,

00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:05,554
by the time he's 15,

00:26:05,621 --> 00:26:07,623
he won't even have
the physical development

00:26:07,689 --> 00:26:09,324
of a ten-year-old.

00:26:09,391 --> 00:26:10,959
Does he actually have AIDS?

00:26:11,026 --> 00:26:12,027
No, not yet.

00:26:12,094 --> 00:26:13,729
He's HIV-positive.

00:26:13,796 --> 00:26:16,532
If you ask me, he's being
badly overmedicated.

00:26:16,598 --> 00:26:18,700
Zendrek has
an FDA black box label.

00:26:18,767 --> 00:26:20,502
That's the strongest
warning there is.

00:26:20,569 --> 00:26:22,137
Life-threatening side effects.

00:26:22,204 --> 00:26:23,772
Some of the other drugs
aren't even on the market.

00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:26,008
They're only being used
in clinical trials.

00:26:26,074 --> 00:26:27,242
Maybe he's in one.

00:26:27,309 --> 00:26:28,444
GRISSOM:
How does
a little kid

00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:30,579
with a junkie mother
and gangster father

00:26:30,646 --> 00:26:32,781
get on a clinical trial?

00:27:02,177 --> 00:27:04,947
♪ ♪

00:27:19,361 --> 00:27:21,730
ADAMS: Well, so much for
the upstanding businessman.

00:27:21,797 --> 00:27:23,265
This guy's real name
is Jin Ming

00:27:23,332 --> 00:27:25,768
and his mug shot was taken
when he was 18 years old

00:27:25,834 --> 00:27:28,437
when he was caught stealing cars
with a street racing gang.

00:27:28,504 --> 00:27:31,106
Now he's 30 and he hasn't
been busted since.

00:27:31,173 --> 00:27:34,076
And Park had this guy's skin
under his fingernails?
Yeah.

00:27:34,143 --> 00:27:35,277
So they must been fighting?

00:27:35,344 --> 00:27:36,879
Possibly.

00:27:36,945 --> 00:27:40,482
The thing is, that skin that was
under Park's nails--

00:27:40,549 --> 00:27:42,618
it was gluteus maximus.

00:27:42,684 --> 00:27:45,120
It's very similar
to the epidermal tissue

00:27:45,187 --> 00:27:46,622
on the rest of the body,

00:27:46,688 --> 00:27:48,557
but it's got far fewer
hair follicles.

00:27:48,624 --> 00:27:50,292
So, in addition
to everything else,

00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:52,461
this kid's been molested?

00:27:52,528 --> 00:27:54,797
Well, maybe not.

00:27:54,863 --> 00:27:57,232
Here.

00:27:57,299 --> 00:27:59,735
Take a look at Jin's neck.

00:27:59,802 --> 00:28:01,170
No tattoos.

00:28:01,236 --> 00:28:03,105
He had a major makeover.

00:28:03,172 --> 00:28:04,773
Yeah.

00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,842
I went out a couple times
with a casino executive

00:28:06,909 --> 00:28:09,678
who had some really
unusual scars.

00:28:09,745 --> 00:28:10,913
And, long story short,

00:28:10,979 --> 00:28:13,182
he told me that
he was very embarrassed

00:28:13,248 --> 00:28:14,917
by some old tattoos that he had.

00:28:14,983 --> 00:28:17,419
So he had them covered
with replicated skin.

00:28:17,486 --> 00:28:18,620
From his butt?

00:28:18,687 --> 00:28:20,889
I didn't ask.

00:28:20,956 --> 00:28:24,326
But, you know,
if you're a street racer,

00:28:24,393 --> 00:28:26,962
then it might be kind of cool
to flash a lot of ink.

00:28:27,029 --> 00:28:29,264
But if you're
a Kkangpae Dragon...

00:28:29,331 --> 00:28:31,266
It pays to be invisible.

00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:33,168
(banging,
wood cracking)

00:28:35,604 --> 00:28:37,806
I got left.

00:28:59,194 --> 00:29:02,664
This basement's the only room
with anything in it.

00:29:02,731 --> 00:29:05,534
The uni's were looking
for the kid, first time through.

00:29:05,601 --> 00:29:07,770
It's probably why
they missed it.

00:29:07,836 --> 00:29:10,906
This must be where
Park and his mother lived.

00:29:11,974 --> 00:29:14,109
Why would this guy Jin
kill somebody

00:29:14,176 --> 00:29:16,478
he let live in his house?

00:29:16,545 --> 00:29:18,680
He's in a gang.
She's a druggie.

00:29:18,747 --> 00:29:21,216
The possibilities
are endless.

00:29:21,283 --> 00:29:23,285
CAVALIERE:
Yeah.

00:29:44,597 --> 00:29:46,198
Look at this.

00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,236
Scumbag's in the picture
with them.

00:29:50,302 --> 00:29:51,704
(ticking)

00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:53,405
(beeping)
Down!

00:29:53,472 --> 00:29:54,840
(explosion)

00:29:54,907 --> 00:29:56,875
(glass shattering,
debris clattering)

00:29:58,944 --> 00:29:59,945
Officer down!

00:30:00,012 --> 00:30:02,348
Clear the house
and call the paramedics!

00:30:05,897 --> 00:30:07,799
SANDERS:
<i>Detective Cavaliere's</i>
<i>going to be all right.</i>

00:30:07,866 --> 00:30:09,200
Minor injuries.

00:30:09,267 --> 00:30:11,870
Bomb squad said the
explosive was a trip
wire booby trap.

00:30:11,936 --> 00:30:14,739
Yeah, if Jin and the K D.
really wanted to hurt somebody,

00:30:14,806 --> 00:30:16,708
they would've sent
a more powerful message.

00:30:16,774 --> 00:30:19,143
So, I found an
ambulance chaser's card

00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:20,612
on Kora Sil's desk.

00:30:20,678 --> 00:30:22,580
I just got off the
phone with him.

00:30:22,647 --> 00:30:25,083
He claims that Kora was
suing Park's doctor.

00:30:25,149 --> 00:30:26,851
For what?
Money.

00:30:26,918 --> 00:30:28,253
According to the lawyer,

00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:30,955
the doctor paid Kora to put
Park on the clinical trial.

00:30:31,022 --> 00:30:32,223
She wanted more.

00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:33,625
How much was she getting?

00:30:33,691 --> 00:30:35,159
25 a week.

00:30:35,226 --> 00:30:37,061
She wanted 50.

00:31:06,357 --> 00:31:08,359
♪ ♪

00:31:28,947 --> 00:31:30,949
Hello, Doctor.
What are you doing here?

00:31:31,015 --> 00:31:32,283
I'm here to give Park
his medication.

00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:35,320
Oh, yeah. He needs to get it
every day, doesn't he?

00:31:35,386 --> 00:31:36,487
Yes.

00:31:36,554 --> 00:31:37,789
Or else the data's useless.

00:31:37,856 --> 00:31:39,224
I suppose so.

00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:40,792
GRISSOM:
Well, then what good
would it do

00:31:40,859 --> 00:31:41,793
to continue to dose him

00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,661
after he went missing
for two days?

00:31:43,728 --> 00:31:46,431
These drugs are saving his life.

00:31:46,497 --> 00:31:47,899
No, they're not.

00:31:47,966 --> 00:31:50,568
I don't need to be
a medical doctor to see that.

00:31:50,635 --> 00:31:52,503
No, what you're seeing
are side effects.

00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:54,138
And there are side
effects to every drug.

00:31:54,205 --> 00:31:57,108
Look, this is a legitimate
clinical trial, Mr. Grissom,

00:31:57,175 --> 00:31:58,943
approved by a
formal committee...

00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:01,813
Consisting of doctors
who are shareholders

00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,115
in the pharmaceutical companies
that make the drugs.

00:32:04,182 --> 00:32:06,818
Without these trials,
these kids get nothing.

00:32:06,885 --> 00:32:08,253
And what do you get?

00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:09,554
Kickbacks?

00:32:09,621 --> 00:32:11,556
Your medical opinion
is irrelevant.

00:32:11,623 --> 00:32:14,125
What I'm doing
is perfectly legal.

00:32:14,192 --> 00:32:15,994
So, we're done here.
Excuse me.

00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,829
You touch that kid,

00:32:17,896 --> 00:32:20,532
and I will charge you
with reckless endangerment.

00:32:21,566 --> 00:32:24,269
Child Services will back him up
on that.

00:32:24,335 --> 00:32:26,738
So I think
you're done here.

00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:31,309
We'll see about that.

00:32:41,886 --> 00:32:43,087
(button clicks)

00:32:44,989 --> 00:32:46,558
Park...

00:32:46,624 --> 00:32:50,495
I need to ask you
a few questions.

00:32:50,562 --> 00:32:54,399
You don't have to answer them,
if you don't want to, okay?

00:33:01,506 --> 00:33:04,008
Do you know this man?

00:33:06,778 --> 00:33:10,248
That's Jin.

00:33:10,315 --> 00:33:11,349
Did you and your mother

00:33:11,416 --> 00:33:13,418
live at his house?

00:33:18,723 --> 00:33:20,725
Is that where
Uncle Sung found you?

00:33:22,727 --> 00:33:23,895
Yeah.

00:33:25,763 --> 00:33:26,698
(Park squeals happily)

00:33:26,764 --> 00:33:29,534
(speaking Korean)

00:33:29,601 --> 00:33:30,835
(groans)

00:33:30,902 --> 00:33:33,238
(speaking Korean)

00:33:36,107 --> 00:33:38,109
(sighs)

00:33:40,945 --> 00:33:42,146
(speaking Korean)

00:33:42,213 --> 00:33:43,448
(breathes weakly)

00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:48,219
Uncle Sung didn't like my tube.

00:33:48,286 --> 00:33:49,921
(shouting in Korean)

00:33:49,988 --> 00:33:52,123
PARK:
<i>He fought with Mama.</i>

00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:54,058
(screams)

00:33:57,629 --> 00:33:59,697
<i>Then Jin came down.</i>

00:33:59,764 --> 00:34:01,332
(Park crying, Jin shouting)

00:34:06,804 --> 00:34:07,805
<i>Uncle Sung</i>

00:34:07,872 --> 00:34:10,108
saved me.

00:34:10,174 --> 00:34:12,243
What happened after that?

00:34:16,447 --> 00:34:18,750
I'm not gonna let Jin

00:34:18,816 --> 00:34:21,819
or Dr. Eisling hurt you.

00:34:21,886 --> 00:34:23,488
But that's why I need

00:34:23,555 --> 00:34:27,192
to know what happened.

00:34:27,258 --> 00:34:29,327
Jin and Mama found us.

00:34:49,013 --> 00:34:51,015
(gunshot)

00:34:59,891 --> 00:35:00,959
(shouting in Korean)

00:35:01,025 --> 00:35:02,460
(two gunshots)

00:35:02,527 --> 00:35:04,295
(shell casing clinks on ground)

00:35:04,362 --> 00:35:06,497
Why would he want
to hurt your mother?

00:35:06,564 --> 00:35:10,501
I guess he was just sick
of having us around.

00:35:10,568 --> 00:35:12,170
(coughs)

00:35:12,237 --> 00:35:14,038
(coughing)

00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,743
I finally got a statement
from the kid.

00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:21,012
He says that Jin
shot both his mother

00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:22,947
and his Uncle
with two different guns.

00:35:23,014 --> 00:35:24,315
BRASS:
Well, that's great.

00:35:24,382 --> 00:35:26,784
Uh, that should be enough
to charge Jin when we find him.

00:35:26,851 --> 00:35:29,988
I-I just got faxed
Sun Bang's prison record.

00:35:30,054 --> 00:35:33,124
And there's something weird
on his personal release form.

00:35:33,191 --> 00:35:35,193
Listen to this:
the guy left prison

00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,361
with a nine millimeter.

00:35:36,427 --> 00:35:38,129
They let him out of jail
with a gun?

00:35:38,196 --> 00:35:39,564
Well, it's only a misdemeanor,
you know.

00:35:39,631 --> 00:35:41,799
It's like a hotel; you get back
what you checked in.

00:35:41,866 --> 00:35:43,635
So you can go out
and commit a felony.

00:35:43,701 --> 00:35:44,802
Apparently.

00:35:44,869 --> 00:35:47,205
Now, is there any chance
that Sung fired back?

00:35:47,272 --> 00:35:49,874
No, we would have found extra
bullets or shells at the scene.

00:35:49,941 --> 00:35:52,443
Well, maybe there's a bullet
lodged in Jin's body.

00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:54,479
No sign of a third bleeder.

00:35:54,546 --> 00:35:55,847
And if I understand the kid,

00:35:55,914 --> 00:35:57,749
Sung never got a chance
to shoot back.

00:35:57,815 --> 00:35:59,284
Okay, thanks. I'll work on this.

00:36:12,497 --> 00:36:13,598
Yep.

00:36:13,665 --> 00:36:15,900
He carried his gun
in his waistband.

00:36:15,967 --> 00:36:18,436
Still doesn't
mean he used it.

00:36:18,503 --> 00:36:20,438
And doesn't really
change Park's story.

00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,642
How do we know Kora
wasn't packing?

00:36:26,644 --> 00:36:28,379
The father of her
son was a gangster.

00:36:28,446 --> 00:36:29,647
She was living
with a gangster.

00:36:29,714 --> 00:36:30,949
I wouldn't put
it past her.

00:36:31,015 --> 00:36:33,017
Well, let's see.

00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:38,289
Most women's
clothes

00:36:38,356 --> 00:36:40,158
don't have a place
to hide a gun.

00:36:40,225 --> 00:36:41,593
That's, uh...

00:36:43,094 --> 00:36:44,896
That's what
purses are for.

00:36:51,502 --> 00:36:54,572
Maybe Kora didn't need
Jin to get her son back.

00:36:54,639 --> 00:36:56,474
Maybe she took care
of it herself.

00:36:56,541 --> 00:36:57,976
(panting)

00:37:10,288 --> 00:37:13,258
(shouting in Korean)

00:37:13,324 --> 00:37:15,126
(gunshot,
people screaming)

00:37:15,193 --> 00:37:16,628
(grunts)

00:37:29,073 --> 00:37:30,008
(grunts)

00:37:30,074 --> 00:37:31,543
(gunshot)

00:37:33,545 --> 00:37:35,079
You think they shot each other.

00:37:35,146 --> 00:37:36,814
Why not?

00:37:36,881 --> 00:37:39,150
There's motive,
the evidence suggests it.

00:37:39,217 --> 00:37:42,153
Where are their guns?

00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:44,455
Dead man with a gun
in the hood.

00:37:44,522 --> 00:37:45,957
Gone in 60 seconds.

00:37:46,024 --> 00:37:49,494
Jin skips town because
this family dispute uncovers

00:37:49,561 --> 00:37:51,696
his once invisible gang.

00:37:51,763 --> 00:37:54,299
He leaves the booby trap
because he's angry about it.

00:37:54,365 --> 00:37:56,434
It's possible.

00:37:56,501 --> 00:37:59,003
It's also possible
that Jin shot both vics.

00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:00,471
Which is what the kid said.

00:38:00,538 --> 00:38:02,507
And he was
the closest witness.

00:38:02,574 --> 00:38:04,475
If your uncle and your mother
shot each other,

00:38:04,542 --> 00:38:07,178
you would probably
blame the gangbanger, too.

00:38:10,215 --> 00:38:12,083
Okay, pilgrim...

00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:14,919
we'll settle this on the street.

00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:19,924
If you need any water or
anything, you just let me know.

00:38:19,991 --> 00:38:21,159
Okay.

00:38:21,226 --> 00:38:24,529
Okay, Park, I know
you already told me

00:38:24,596 --> 00:38:26,664
what-what happened,
but now I need you

00:38:26,731 --> 00:38:29,267
to show me
what happened, okay?

00:38:29,334 --> 00:38:31,569
Now, we're gonna pretend
that this is your mother,

00:38:31,636 --> 00:38:35,240
this is your uncle,
and that's Jin.

00:38:35,306 --> 00:38:38,309
Would you show me
where your uncle was standing

00:38:38,376 --> 00:38:40,378
when the shooting began?

00:38:48,419 --> 00:38:51,055
Where was your mother standing
when the shooting began?

00:39:01,099 --> 00:39:03,902
Would you show me
where Jin was standing?

00:39:09,674 --> 00:39:11,242
And where were you
standing?

00:39:17,882 --> 00:39:19,150
Did your uncle have a gun?

00:39:20,818 --> 00:39:23,121
Did your mother have a gun?

00:39:25,423 --> 00:39:27,892
Did your mother fall down

00:39:27,959 --> 00:39:29,427
before Jin shot her?

00:39:31,095 --> 00:39:34,132
Did Jin fall down
before he shot your mother?

00:39:37,268 --> 00:39:38,403
He's lying.

00:39:38,469 --> 00:39:39,604
Well, the ferrotrace

00:39:39,671 --> 00:39:41,839
doesn't confirm
that either of them had guns

00:39:41,906 --> 00:39:43,274
at the time of the shooting.

00:39:43,341 --> 00:39:45,476
But the trajectory...

00:39:45,543 --> 00:39:46,811
Neither Kora nor Jin fell.

00:39:46,878 --> 00:39:48,279
How do you explain

00:39:48,346 --> 00:39:50,715
Kora's 20-degree entry?

00:39:54,719 --> 00:39:55,920
Park,

00:39:55,987 --> 00:40:00,158
could you show me
how Jin shot your mother?

00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:16,174
It was like this:
Bang, bang!

00:40:21,045 --> 00:40:22,213
Park, would you do that again?

00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,782
But this time,
keep your arm out.

00:40:24,849 --> 00:40:26,851
Bang, bang!

00:40:45,603 --> 00:40:47,705
(shouting in Korean)

00:40:49,874 --> 00:40:51,442
(shouting)

00:40:52,544 --> 00:40:54,946
(grunts)

00:41:06,791 --> 00:41:08,793
(speaking Korean)

00:41:24,976 --> 00:41:26,544
(gunshot, blood splattering)

00:41:26,611 --> 00:41:27,545
(another gunshot)

00:41:27,612 --> 00:41:29,013
(shell casing clinks on ground)

00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,348
(crowd screaming)

00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:35,920
The kid shot his mother
for shooting his uncle.

00:41:35,987 --> 00:41:38,122
So you think Jin
had nothing to do with it?

00:41:38,189 --> 00:41:40,425
Not the shooting.

00:41:40,491 --> 00:41:41,593
Well, it makes sense.

00:41:41,659 --> 00:41:43,428
I mean, his uncle was trying
to protect him,

00:41:43,494 --> 00:41:44,963
and his mother
was torturing him.

00:41:46,998 --> 00:41:49,767
GRISSOM:
<i>Park never controlled</i>
<i>anything in his life</i>

00:41:49,834 --> 00:41:51,836
<i>till he fired that gun.</i>

00:42:04,382 --> 00:42:07,452
BRASS:
<i>An HIV-positive eight-year-old.</i>

00:42:07,518 --> 00:42:10,054
<i>No wonder</i>
<i>no one wanted to talk.</i>

00:42:10,121 --> 00:42:13,992
<i>Juvi may be</i>
<i>the best thing for him.</i>

00:42:14,058 --> 00:42:15,159
<i>He'll get the care</i>

00:42:15,226 --> 00:42:16,194
he needs there.

00:42:16,261 --> 00:42:18,263
Yeah.

00:42:20,365 --> 00:42:22,700
I'm sorry we solved this.

00:42:27,539 --> 00:42:28,840
I really am.
