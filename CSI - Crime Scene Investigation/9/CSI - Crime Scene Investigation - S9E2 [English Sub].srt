Catherine.

The doorman I.D.'d her
as Sprig Greniger.

Apartment 2204.
Lives with her boyfriend.


00:04:41,075 --> 00:04:42,510
We're putting out
a broadcast.


00:04:42,577 --> 00:04:44,846

why Sprig was sprung.

No sign of forced entry.


00:05:03,264 --> 00:05:05,900
No struggle.


00:05:05,967 --> 00:05:07,935
Nice place.
Mm-hmm.


00:05:08,002 --> 00:05:10,671
Something smells
really good.


00:05:17,111 --> 00:05:20,415
(traffic passes below,

00:05:32,293 --> 00:05:34,595

00:05:40,868 --> 00:05:42,036

00:05:42,103 --> 00:05:43,371
(closes oven)


00:05:51,712 --> 00:05:53,915
Cook ten hours at 200 degrees.


00:05:57,585 --> 00:05:59,053
Hey.


00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,856
She was getting married
in less than two weeks.


00:06:01,923 --> 00:06:03,224
What?


00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:05,626
Yeah, she was having dinner
with the in-laws tonight.


00:06:05,693 --> 00:06:08,796
"Pot roast. Make and reheat."


00:06:08,863 --> 00:06:12,200
Less than an hour left
on the pot roast.


00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:19,173
Turn on the news,
make a pot roast,


00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,844
slip into a bikini,
and commit suicide?


00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:25,913
Yeah, it doesn't make
a whole lot of sense.
Mnh-mnh.


00:06:28,382 --> 00:06:30,818
She got a call
just before midnight.


00:06:30,885 --> 00:06:33,321
Maybe she and the boyfriend
had a fight.


00:06:33,387 --> 00:06:34,655
(phone beeps on)


00:06:35,723 --> 00:06:37,358

00:06:37,425 --> 00:06:38,426
What?


00:06:38,493 --> 00:06:39,427
Nothing.


00:06:39,494 --> 00:06:40,628

00:06:41,662 --> 00:06:43,030
Archie, it's Catherine.


00:06:43,097 --> 00:06:44,899
Can you run a number for me?


00:06:44,966 --> 00:06:48,236
(siren wailing in distance)


00:06:48,302 --> 00:06:49,971
Sir.


00:06:51,406 --> 00:06:53,007
Williams. Doc.


00:06:53,074 --> 00:06:56,377
What took so long
for the lab to get here?


00:06:56,444 --> 00:06:59,547
We're a little shorthanded,
Detective.


00:06:59,614 --> 00:07:01,616
Sorry. Forgot.


00:07:02,784 --> 00:07:05,286
Delivery guy found her here
a couple of hours ago.


00:07:05,353 --> 00:07:06,821
Rough neighborhood.


00:07:10,024 --> 00:07:13,227
(siren wails, then stops)


00:07:16,764 --> 00:07:19,100
ROBBINS:
Looks like someone was having


00:07:19,167 --> 00:07:20,768
a five-finger discussion
with her.


00:07:20,835 --> 00:07:23,805
The language of the streets.


00:07:23,871 --> 00:07:25,139
And there's your money shot.


00:07:25,206 --> 00:07:27,308
Blunt-force trauma


00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:28,810
to the back
of the skull.


00:07:28,876 --> 00:07:31,612
(distorted grunting)


00:07:31,679 --> 00:07:34,015
I think I found ground zero.


00:07:35,316 --> 00:07:39,253
And I found a room key
in her back pocket.


00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,622
Tangiers.


00:07:41,689 --> 00:07:43,458
I'll check it out.


00:07:43,524 --> 00:07:46,060
I don't see a purse.


00:07:46,127 --> 00:07:47,829
Maybe she was a tourist


00:07:47,895 --> 00:07:50,631
trying to score something
a little stronger than alcohol.


00:07:50,698 --> 00:07:52,834
(gasping, grunting)


00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,836
Detective, give me
a hand here, would you?
Yeah.


00:08:01,142 --> 00:08:03,511
The globes of her eyeballs
are ruptured.

00:08:03,578 --> 00:08:06,247
Looks like someone
thumbed them back

00:08:06,314 --> 00:08:08,082
into the orbital socket.

00:08:08,149 --> 00:08:10,752
You know, they, uh,
they squish like grapes.

00:08:10,818 --> 00:08:14,255
This was rage.

00:08:14,322 --> 00:08:16,457
Pure rage.

00:08:19,327 --> 00:08:22,263

rhythmically)

00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:25,333
(respirators hissing quietly)

00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:35,109
Hi. Sorry to hear
about Brown.

00:08:35,176 --> 00:08:38,246
Gonna miss him.
Yeah. Me, too.

00:08:38,312 --> 00:08:41,048
Your victim was
a 34-year-old
black female.

00:08:41,115 --> 00:08:44,719
Been in a coma
for eight years.

00:08:44,786 --> 00:08:46,854
Result of a rape assault.

00:08:51,459 --> 00:08:53,895
I worked the case,
along with Sidle.

00:08:53,961 --> 00:08:55,863
Looks like the husband
disconnected the
breathing tube.

00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:58,533
I can't get him
away from her.

00:08:58,599 --> 00:09:00,701
The uniforms are gonna
go in and drag him out.

00:09:00,768 --> 00:09:02,503
I'm just waiting for you.

00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:05,206
Why don't you, uh,
hold off on that.

00:09:05,273 --> 00:09:07,875
I'd just like
to make a call first.

I wonder how many guys go
on diets before their weddings.

00:10:15,209 --> 00:10:18,646
She was filing
for unemployment.

00:10:18,713 --> 00:10:20,581
Bank teller.

00:10:20,648 --> 00:10:23,284

sent her over the edge.

Okay, thanks.

00:10:34,362 --> 00:10:37,131
So, the last call
to Sprig's cell

00:10:37,198 --> 00:10:40,468
was from a pay phone
on Paradise and Moesser Avenue.

00:10:40,535 --> 00:10:43,538
That's right across the street.

00:10:48,943 --> 00:10:50,244
Yeah.

00:10:50,311 --> 00:10:53,247
STOKES:
Whoever called Sprig
had a front-row seat.

00:10:54,482 --> 00:10:57,185
I'll print the phone,
see what I can get.

Catherine...

00:11:01,923 --> 00:11:05,026
this is Brett Davidson;
he's the victim's fiancée.

00:11:05,093 --> 00:11:07,695
Mr. Davidson,
I'm sorry for your loss.

00:11:07,762 --> 00:11:09,330
How often do you
have to say that?

00:11:09,397 --> 00:11:11,532
Often.

00:11:11,599 --> 00:11:13,501
You live here.

00:11:13,568 --> 00:11:14,502
Right?

00:11:14,569 --> 00:11:15,670
Yeah.

00:11:15,737 --> 00:11:18,673
I'm sorry, I'm gonna
have to print you.

00:11:26,447 --> 00:11:28,616
Where were you,
Mr. Davidson?

00:11:28,683 --> 00:11:30,418
I had a business
trip in Phoenix.

00:11:30,485 --> 00:11:32,420
I was just
gone for a day.

00:11:33,955 --> 00:11:36,224
Was your fiancée depressed?

00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:39,694
No, she invented
the silver lining.

00:11:39,761 --> 00:11:41,162
We were getting married.

00:11:41,229 --> 00:11:43,064
We were having my parents
over for dinner.

00:11:43,131 --> 00:11:44,399
She'd been planning
it for weeks.

00:11:44,465 --> 00:11:45,900
Were the two of you
having problems?

00:11:45,967 --> 00:11:46,901
No.

00:11:46,968 --> 00:11:48,903
I mean...

00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:50,772
weddings don't always
bring out the best in women.

00:11:50,838 --> 00:11:51,906
What do you mean?

00:11:51,973 --> 00:11:55,510
She didn't want
"fat" wedding pictures,

00:11:55,576 --> 00:11:58,079
so she stopped eating.

00:11:58,146 --> 00:12:03,050
Obsessively counting calories,
and all that diet stuff.

00:12:03,117 --> 00:12:04,986
(sighs)

00:12:05,052 --> 00:12:06,988
And there's
the cost of the wedding,

00:12:07,054 --> 00:12:09,190
the honeymoon.

00:12:09,257 --> 00:12:11,526
Plus the, uh, mortgage
on this place.

00:12:11,592 --> 00:12:13,394
I told her not to
worry about money,

00:12:13,461 --> 00:12:15,196
that I could pay
for everything.

00:12:15,263 --> 00:12:17,765
I told her that all the time.

00:12:17,832 --> 00:12:19,734
Did she quit her job?

00:12:19,801 --> 00:12:21,402
It was a misunderstanding.

00:12:21,469 --> 00:12:23,104
Her drawer came in short.

00:12:23,171 --> 00:12:24,939
After five years

00:12:25,006 --> 00:12:27,208
of loyal service,
the bank accused her

00:12:27,275 --> 00:12:29,043
of stealing ten grand.

00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:31,612
She didn't do it.

00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:34,615
It's just not who she is.

00:12:41,289 --> 00:12:43,691
I held the scene
for you.

00:12:46,794 --> 00:12:48,129
Thanks.

00:12:50,164 --> 00:12:51,099
Tom?

00:12:51,165 --> 00:12:52,767
Sarah.

00:12:52,834 --> 00:12:54,102
What are you
doing here?

00:12:54,168 --> 00:12:56,170
I thought
you'd been away.

00:12:58,072 --> 00:13:00,141
I am so sorry.

00:13:01,175 --> 00:13:03,711
I know how much
you loved her.

00:13:03,778 --> 00:13:05,446
I promised to protect her.

00:13:06,481 --> 00:13:08,483
I failed her once.

00:13:08,549 --> 00:13:10,384
I wasn't gonna
fail her again.

00:13:10,451 --> 00:13:11,819
What do you mean?

00:13:11,886 --> 00:13:13,855
He started calling me.

00:13:13,921 --> 00:13:15,389
Harassing me.

00:13:15,456 --> 00:13:17,525
THOMAS:
And he was here
in her room.

00:13:17,592 --> 00:13:19,260
Who was here, Mr. Adler?
The guy

00:13:19,327 --> 00:13:20,428
who put her here...

00:13:20,495 --> 00:13:22,897
<i>Tony Thorpe.</i>

00:13:22,964 --> 00:13:24,132
<i>He left me a newspaper clipping</i>

00:13:24,198 --> 00:13:26,567
<i>from eight years ago,</i>
<i>with a note.</i>

00:13:26,634 --> 00:13:28,536
<i>Said he violated her again.</i>

00:13:28,603 --> 00:13:30,571
<i>That she liked it more</i>
<i>the second time.</i>

00:13:30,638 --> 00:13:35,243
<i>It's the only way</i>
<i>I knew to save her.</i>

00:13:35,309 --> 00:13:37,245
You still have the newspaper?

00:13:37,311 --> 00:13:39,680
We could run it
for prints.

00:13:39,747 --> 00:13:41,282
It made me sick

00:13:41,349 --> 00:13:42,750
to my stomach.

00:13:42,817 --> 00:13:44,285
I burned it.

00:13:44,352 --> 00:13:45,286
Mr. Adler,

00:13:45,353 --> 00:13:46,587
you need to
come with me.

00:13:46,654 --> 00:13:48,122
We need to
go downtown

00:13:48,189 --> 00:13:49,424
so you can give
a statement.

00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:50,491
Tom, look. Um...

00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,097
I-I am no longer
a CSI, but...

00:13:56,164 --> 00:13:59,033
I'll go with you. Okay?

00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,035
I won't leave you.

00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:07,375
Here's what got
our jumper fired.

00:14:10,278 --> 00:14:12,013
He's making change.

00:14:13,081 --> 00:14:14,182
(taps keys)

00:14:17,852 --> 00:14:19,587
WILLOWS:
Oh.

00:14:19,654 --> 00:14:20,988
He gave her two 50s.

00:14:21,055 --> 00:14:23,091
She gave him
a hundred hundreds.

00:14:23,157 --> 00:14:24,125
Ten grand.

00:14:24,192 --> 00:14:25,460
Mm.

00:14:25,526 --> 00:14:26,994
Bank manager said
when he questioned her,

00:14:27,061 --> 00:14:30,164
she couldn't remember
the customer <i>or</i> the transaction.

00:14:32,533 --> 00:14:34,802
WILLOWS:
But there's no
gun, no note.

00:14:34,869 --> 00:14:36,237
She doesn't appear
to be under duress.

00:14:36,304 --> 00:14:37,605
Which is exactly

00:14:37,672 --> 00:14:40,308
why the bank figured it was
a scam-- she was in on it.

00:14:40,374 --> 00:14:41,943
Now, this is a
day-shift case

00:14:42,009 --> 00:14:43,778
from a couple of weeks ago.

00:14:43,845 --> 00:14:45,279
Different bank,

00:14:45,346 --> 00:14:46,814
same guy, same gag.

00:14:46,881 --> 00:14:48,116
The guy hands
her two $50s.

00:14:48,182 --> 00:14:50,685
She counts out a hundred
hundred-dollar bills

00:14:50,752 --> 00:14:52,820
According to the case file,

00:14:52,887 --> 00:14:54,822
she can't remember
anything either.

00:14:54,889 --> 00:14:56,557
WOMAN:
<i>I've been working</i>
<i>at First Federation</i>

00:14:56,624 --> 00:14:58,493
nine years.

00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,161
Perfect record.

00:15:01,195 --> 00:15:02,296
Miss Powell,

00:15:02,363 --> 00:15:03,831
do you recognize this man?

00:15:03,898 --> 00:15:07,034
If I knew who he was,
I'd hunt him down myself.

00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:14,175
You know, memory
is a funny thing.

00:15:14,242 --> 00:15:16,144
Even when they
showed me the video,

00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:19,313
I couldn't remember this guy.

00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:22,417
Now my mind starts thinking
I <i>do</i> know him.

00:15:25,153 --> 00:15:26,988
But I'm just recognizing him
from all the times

00:15:27,054 --> 00:15:28,790
you cops keep showing me
his damn, ugly picture.

00:15:28,856 --> 00:15:30,057
And you don't have

00:15:30,124 --> 00:15:32,527
any memory of what happened
the day he came in.

00:15:32,593 --> 00:15:34,996
You <i>always</i> remember
the day you got fired.

00:15:35,063 --> 00:15:39,067
What I <i>can't</i> remember,
is "Light Fingers" Louie there.

00:15:40,535 --> 00:15:42,336
Miss Powell,
have you been doing anything

00:15:42,403 --> 00:15:43,337
to lose weight recently?

00:15:43,404 --> 00:15:44,338
Now you saying

00:15:44,405 --> 00:15:46,007
I look fat? Because I only

00:15:46,074 --> 00:15:47,942
gained three pounds
since I quit smoking.

00:15:48,009 --> 00:15:49,944
Oh.

00:15:50,011 --> 00:15:51,345
And how did you quit?

00:15:51,412 --> 00:15:53,681
Went to the stop-smoking lady.

00:15:53,748 --> 00:15:55,283
You trying to quit, too?

00:15:55,349 --> 00:15:57,318
'Cause, uh...

00:15:59,087 --> 00:16:00,221
I got her number.

00:16:26,013 --> 00:16:27,949
(performers clucking
like chickens)

00:16:28,015 --> 00:16:30,017
(audience laughing)

00:16:32,854 --> 00:16:34,856
(performers clucking,
audience laughing)

00:16:37,158 --> 00:16:40,962
My, that's a big, big egg
you're trying to lay.

00:16:41,028 --> 00:16:42,563
(laughter)

00:16:44,832 --> 00:16:48,102
All right, back
to your roosts.

00:16:48,169 --> 00:16:51,038
Back to your roosts.

00:16:51,105 --> 00:16:53,574
Back, back,
back to your roost.

00:16:53,641 --> 00:16:54,776
(clucking continues)

00:16:54,842 --> 00:16:58,746
Now, on my count of three,
you will go into a deep

00:16:58,813 --> 00:17:02,717
state of relaxation.

00:17:02,784 --> 00:17:07,922
Your eyes will become heavy.

00:17:07,989 --> 00:17:10,725
One... two... three.
(snapping fingers)

00:17:10,792 --> 00:17:12,260
Relax.

00:17:12,326 --> 00:17:13,928
(audience laughs)

00:17:13,995 --> 00:17:18,199
Deeper and deeper
into a state of relaxation.

00:17:19,467 --> 00:17:21,069
Deeper...

00:17:21,135 --> 00:17:22,770
and deeper.

00:17:22,837 --> 00:17:25,406
You are feeling...

00:17:25,473 --> 00:17:28,943
very comfortable.

00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:30,278
Now, sweetheart,

00:17:30,344 --> 00:17:35,416
I'm handing you
a delicious, crunchy apple.

00:17:35,483 --> 00:17:36,751
MAN:
Oh, no.

00:17:36,818 --> 00:17:39,487
When I tell you to open
your eyes, you will bite

00:17:39,554 --> 00:17:42,757
into this delicious,
crunchy apple.

00:17:42,824 --> 00:17:45,426
One, two, three--
(snapping fingers)

00:17:45,493 --> 00:17:47,428
open your eyes.

00:17:47,495 --> 00:17:49,630
AUDIENCE:
Ohh...

00:17:49,697 --> 00:17:51,866
(laughing)

00:17:51,933 --> 00:17:54,469
(applause)

00:17:54,535 --> 00:17:56,704
MADAME MARVELOUS:
<i>Well, the show just</i>
<i>pays the bills,</i>

00:17:56,771 --> 00:17:59,540
but most of my work
is private client therapy.

00:17:59,607 --> 00:18:02,777
Was a young lady named Sprig
Greniger a client of yours?

00:18:02,844 --> 00:18:04,912
She wanted to lose weight
for her honeymoon,

00:18:04,979 --> 00:18:06,781
and she lost 12 pounds.
Well,

00:18:06,848 --> 00:18:07,782
what did you do?

00:18:07,849 --> 00:18:09,650
Well, I didn't
<i>do</i> anything.

00:18:09,717 --> 00:18:11,586
All hypnosis is self-hypnosis.

00:18:11,652 --> 00:18:14,722
Look, people clucking like
chickens and humping chairs,

00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:17,391
that's all...
that's all <i>schtick.</i>

00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:18,392
But...

00:18:18,459 --> 00:18:20,228
when they come to
me for therapy,

00:18:20,294 --> 00:18:21,729
they have a goal.

00:18:21,796 --> 00:18:23,931
They want to lose weight
or stop smoking,

00:18:23,998 --> 00:18:27,902
and I do visualizations
to help them get there.

00:18:27,969 --> 00:18:30,071
"See your lungs healthy."

00:18:30,138 --> 00:18:31,939
"See yourself
in a bathing suit."

00:18:32,006 --> 00:18:33,007
What kind

00:18:33,074 --> 00:18:34,709
of visualizations
did you give Sprig?

00:18:34,776 --> 00:18:35,877
I told her to, uh,

00:18:35,943 --> 00:18:38,746
picture herself in a...
in a teeny bikini,

00:18:38,813 --> 00:18:40,915
on a beach in Hawaii,

00:18:40,982 --> 00:18:43,751
taking off her towel,
then running across the sand

00:18:43,818 --> 00:18:45,820
and jumping
into the water,

00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:48,323
feeling fit and confident.

00:18:48,323 --> 00:18:49,258
Sounds pretty simple.

00:18:49,324 --> 00:18:51,093
It is and it isn't.

00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,227
Hypnosis just helps you go

00:18:52,294 --> 00:18:54,163
into different states
of consciousness.

00:18:54,229 --> 00:18:56,098
I mean, beta is your
most conscious state.

00:18:56,165 --> 00:18:57,566
That's what
we're all in right now.

00:18:57,633 --> 00:18:59,501
And then
there's alpha.

00:18:59,568 --> 00:19:01,370
That's your
meditative state.

00:19:01,437 --> 00:19:03,939
And then theta.
That's your dream state.

00:19:04,006 --> 00:19:06,708
And finally, there's delta.

00:19:06,775 --> 00:19:08,911
That's that <i>super</i> deep sleep
you go into

00:19:08,977 --> 00:19:11,380
after feeling really exhausted.

00:19:11,447 --> 00:19:15,551
I mean, have either one of you
ever gotten to work and then

00:19:15,617 --> 00:19:16,718
forgotten how
you got there?

00:19:16,785 --> 00:19:17,853
Forgotten
the entire ride?

00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,188
Well, then

00:19:19,254 --> 00:19:21,390
essentially, you've been
in a hypnotic state.

00:19:21,457 --> 00:19:23,592
I mean, being in love,
all you see is good.

00:19:23,659 --> 00:19:25,728
Being in grief,
all you see is bad.

00:19:25,794 --> 00:19:28,864
It's all altered states,
and we float between them.

00:19:28,931 --> 00:19:31,266
What state of mind
was the onion-eater in?

00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:34,036
Well, he was somewhere
between alpha and theta.

00:19:34,103 --> 00:19:35,738
And what will he remember?

00:19:35,804 --> 00:19:36,939
Eating an onion?

00:19:37,005 --> 00:19:38,107
Or eating an apple?

00:19:38,173 --> 00:19:40,375
As far as he knows,
he ate an apple.

00:19:40,442 --> 00:19:42,144
Because you told him
it was an apple.

00:19:42,211 --> 00:19:44,146
Well, because he wanted
to eat an apple.

00:19:44,213 --> 00:19:46,415
So, could you convince
people to do anything?

00:19:46,482 --> 00:19:48,083
Like...

00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:49,284
rob a bank?

00:19:49,351 --> 00:19:50,452
(laughs)

00:19:52,154 --> 00:19:54,323
Hypnosis is not magic;
I cannot <i>make</i> people

00:19:54,389 --> 00:19:56,492
do things that they
wouldn't otherwise do,

00:19:56,558 --> 00:19:58,627
unless...

00:19:58,694 --> 00:20:00,829
unless it was already
in their nature.

00:20:03,232 --> 00:20:05,167
WILLIAMS:
The prints came back.
Paula Bonfilio,

00:20:05,234 --> 00:20:07,169
high school guidance
counselor from Henderson.

00:20:07,236 --> 00:20:09,104
How about the Tangiers
room key in her pocket?

00:20:09,171 --> 00:20:11,106
The room was registered
to a pit boss there.

00:20:11,173 --> 00:20:13,242
Says he uses it
to entertain high rollers.

00:20:13,308 --> 00:20:15,110
She didn't sound like
a high roller to me.

00:20:15,177 --> 00:20:16,745
Pit boss says he can
tell like clockwork

00:20:16,812 --> 00:20:17,846
when she gets her paycheck.

00:20:17,913 --> 00:20:19,314
Last night she was
in pretty deep.

00:20:19,381 --> 00:20:21,016
He helped her get
out of the hole.

00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:22,117
Oh, I get it.

00:20:22,184 --> 00:20:23,552
You get a DNA sample?

00:20:23,619 --> 00:20:26,655
It matched the semen Grissom
found in her vaginal vault.

00:20:26,722 --> 00:20:30,325
Well, I'm glad
she's guiding our youth.

00:20:30,392 --> 00:20:31,960
Look, I'm hung up
at the sheriff's office

00:20:32,027 --> 00:20:33,462
helping them look
for a new undersheriff.

00:20:33,529 --> 00:20:35,798
You're gonna find out what she
was doing in Alphabet City?

00:20:35,864 --> 00:20:38,467
Yes, sir. I'm on my way
to talk to the family right now.

00:20:38,534 --> 00:20:40,335
Okay, stay safe.
Okay.

00:20:44,606 --> 00:20:45,541
(knocking on door)

00:20:45,607 --> 00:20:46,775
MAN:
Can I help you?

00:20:53,215 --> 00:20:54,149
WILLIAMS:
And you are?

00:20:54,216 --> 00:20:56,351
I'm, I'm
Scott Bonfilio.

00:20:56,418 --> 00:20:58,420
So, Scott, is
your dad around?

00:20:58,487 --> 00:20:59,721
I don't have a dad.

00:20:59,788 --> 00:21:01,623
I mean, I... I don't
know who he is.

00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:02,658
I'm Detective Williams,

00:21:02,724 --> 00:21:04,626
LVPD. This is Gil Grissom,

00:21:04,693 --> 00:21:05,961
from the Crime Lab.

00:21:06,028 --> 00:21:08,163
Is this about my mom?
Is she in trouble?

00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:11,767
I'm sorry to have to
tell you this, but...

00:21:11,834 --> 00:21:13,302
your mom has died.

00:21:13,368 --> 00:21:15,437
It appears she
was murdered.

00:21:18,507 --> 00:21:20,843
But I, I talked
to her last night.

00:21:20,909 --> 00:21:21,877
She was fine.

00:21:21,944 --> 00:21:22,911
What time?

00:21:22,978 --> 00:21:24,980
Um...

00:21:25,047 --> 00:21:26,982
Like around 10:00 or so.

00:21:27,049 --> 00:21:28,317
She was with Lexi.

00:21:28,383 --> 00:21:29,718
Who's that?

00:21:29,785 --> 00:21:32,054
She's my baby sister.

00:21:35,624 --> 00:21:38,460
We interrupt our program with
this important Amber Alert.

00:21:38,527 --> 00:21:40,796
Please help police
find this little girl...

00:21:40,863 --> 00:21:43,632
She's just two years old
and named Lexi Bonfilio.

00:21:43,699 --> 00:21:45,534
Lexi's mother
was last seen alive

00:21:45,601 --> 00:21:46,802
up at Tangiers Casino Hotel...

00:21:46,869 --> 00:21:48,904
Wow, that's was really fast.

00:21:48,971 --> 00:21:52,574
We take missing children
very seriously.

00:21:52,641 --> 00:21:54,510
Did you find me anything
with DNA on it?

00:21:54,576 --> 00:21:55,744
Yes.

00:22:03,152 --> 00:22:04,920
I-I haven't washed it.

00:22:04,987 --> 00:22:06,088
Will that work?

00:22:06,155 --> 00:22:07,723
It's perfect.

00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:10,192
Scott, when was the last time
you saw your mother?

00:22:10,259 --> 00:22:11,360
Yesterday at school.

00:22:11,427 --> 00:22:14,029
She said she and Lexi 
were going shopping

00:22:14,096 --> 00:22:17,566
I had to work, so I didn't
get home till around 7:00.

00:22:17,633 --> 00:22:19,468
And she called
around 10:00?
Yeah.

00:22:19,535 --> 00:22:23,072
She said she... would be gone
for the night.

00:22:23,138 --> 00:22:25,374
Is that normal?

00:22:25,441 --> 00:22:26,442
Gone for the night?
Yes.

00:22:26,508 --> 00:22:30,712
With Lexi...
only if I have to work.

00:22:30,779 --> 00:22:32,114
Did she say where she was or...?

00:22:32,181 --> 00:22:33,282
No.

00:22:33,348 --> 00:22:36,852
And I stopped asking.

00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:38,487
I know this sounds terrible,

00:22:38,554 --> 00:22:41,723
but I'm....
I'm a straight-A senior.

00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:43,792
Going to community college
next year

00:22:43,859 --> 00:22:46,428
because my mom gambled away
my college money.

00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:50,132
<i>I started hiding my paychecks</i>

00:22:50,199 --> 00:22:51,967
<i>but my mom would</i>
<i>find them anyway.</i>

00:22:57,139 --> 00:23:02,177
<i>And then she'd go to the tables</i>
<i>and lose it all.</i>

00:23:02,244 --> 00:23:05,781
This isn't your typical
mother-son relationship.

00:23:05,848 --> 00:23:07,783
Is it possible that your
sister's with her father?

00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:09,151
No.

00:23:09,218 --> 00:23:12,087
My mom's always
been kind of a...

00:23:12,154 --> 00:23:13,756
kind of a party girl.

00:23:13,822 --> 00:23:15,924
But she never
brought guys home.

00:23:15,991 --> 00:23:19,261
When she got pregnant
with Lexi...

00:23:19,328 --> 00:23:21,363
she said she was a gift
from God.

00:23:25,311 --> 00:23:28,314
I got a pretty good timeline
on Paul Bonfilio.

00:23:28,381 --> 00:23:29,582
At 4:15 p.m.,

00:23:29,649 --> 00:23:31,917
a hold was placed
on Paul's credit card

00:23:31,984 --> 00:23:33,753
by the Tangiers
Casino Day Care.

00:23:33,819 --> 00:23:37,556
Casino day care;
there's the fifth
sign of the Apocalypse.

00:23:37,623 --> 00:23:40,926
She loses big for
a couple of hours.


00:23:40,993 --> 00:23:43,896
Leaves the table
around 6:00 p.m.


00:23:43,963 --> 00:23:46,198
Picked her up
on another camera

00:23:46,265 --> 00:23:48,701
heading away with some
cheesy-looking dude.

00:23:48,768 --> 00:23:50,403
Brass ID'd him
as a pit boss.

00:23:50,469 --> 00:23:52,872
Entertainer to the desperate.

00:23:52,938 --> 00:23:55,308
She goes back to the
tables around 7:00

00:23:55,374 --> 00:23:57,043
but didn't play
for very long.

00:23:57,109 --> 00:23:59,078
She got a call
from a disposable
cell phone.

00:23:59,145 --> 00:24:04,517
I'm thinking it was from...
this guy.

00:24:04,583 --> 00:24:09,221
He grabs her.
She grabs her
last 500-dollar chip,

00:24:09,288 --> 00:24:11,290
and they split.

00:24:11,357 --> 00:24:12,825
He got her out of there
before she lost it all.

00:24:12,892 --> 00:24:14,160
You know,
higher denomination chips

00:24:14,226 --> 00:24:16,062
sometimes carry
a radio frequency device.

00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:18,331
I'll call the casino.
They'll flag it.

00:24:18,397 --> 00:24:21,167
Someone tries to cash it,
they'll tell us.

00:24:21,233 --> 00:24:23,469
At 8:15 p.m.,

00:24:23,536 --> 00:24:26,138
she and Mr. Grabby
pick up the baby.

00:24:26,205 --> 00:24:27,974
So now she's got
the baby.

00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,475
The next time I have her
is at

00:24:29,542 --> 00:24:33,179
Pete's Pawnshop
downtown,
B Street.

00:24:33,245 --> 00:24:35,014
Right where you
found the body.

00:24:35,081 --> 00:24:36,449
Her ATM card
was rejected there

00:24:36,515 --> 00:24:38,417
just after 9:00 p.m.

00:24:38,484 --> 00:24:40,286
The account was overdrawn.

00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:45,257
And then we have a cell phone
call to home around 10:00 p.m.

00:24:45,324 --> 00:24:47,593
That's it
for the timeline.

00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:50,196
Last seen with a man
wearing glasses

00:24:50,262 --> 00:24:52,465
inside Pete's Pawnshop.

00:24:52,531 --> 00:24:55,835
I found broken optical glass
in the alley out back.

00:24:55,901 --> 00:25:00,082
Maybe we're looking
at her killer.

00:25:12,758 --> 00:25:14,393
Is this justice?

00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,162
He's a victim in this.

00:25:16,229 --> 00:25:19,398
He had admitted
killing his wife.

00:25:19,465 --> 00:25:22,702
Active euthanasia
is felony murder.

00:25:22,768 --> 00:25:25,972
I feel for the guy,
but it's out of my hands.

00:25:26,038 --> 00:25:27,673
He said that Thorpe
went to Pam's room,

00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:29,141
did God only knows what,

00:25:29,208 --> 00:25:30,776
called his house,
bragged about it...

00:25:30,843 --> 00:25:32,178
We're checking
into that.

00:25:32,245 --> 00:25:34,046
It would have helped
if he saved the note.

00:25:34,113 --> 00:25:35,982
Would you
if it was your wife?

00:25:36,048 --> 00:25:37,016
Sara,

00:25:37,083 --> 00:25:39,485
the fact is,
he unplugged her tube,

00:25:39,552 --> 00:25:41,287
and he watched her die.

00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:46,626
This is why I can't
do this anymore.

00:25:50,434 --> 00:25:52,202
None of the calls
to Tom Adler's home phone

00:25:52,269 --> 00:25:53,871
could be traced back
to Tony Thorpe.

00:25:53,937 --> 00:25:55,205
Well, he could use
the pay phone

00:25:55,272 --> 00:25:56,707
or a disposable phone.

00:25:56,773 --> 00:25:57,875
There's no evidence

00:25:57,941 --> 00:25:59,977
Thorpe was ever
in Pam Adler's room.

00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:04,130
No trace of him
on her or in her.

00:26:04,196 --> 00:26:07,032
And Doc Robbins found no sign
of sexual assault.

00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:08,834
Yeah, but we don't know
when that happened.

00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:10,669
And we both know
that semen deteriorates

00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:12,271
within 12 to 24 hours.

00:26:12,338 --> 00:26:14,406
Sara, you have to consider
the possibility

00:26:14,473 --> 00:26:15,841
that the husband
made up the story

00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:16,976
to justify his actions.

00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:19,545
No, absolutely not.

00:26:19,612 --> 00:26:21,113
I'm not saying
he didn't love her.

00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,281
He loved her so much

00:26:22,348 --> 00:26:23,983
that he kept her alive
for eight years.

00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:25,351
You're still
a scientist.

00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:28,387
You know that after
that many years
of atrophy,

00:26:28,454 --> 00:26:30,055
she wasn't coming
back to him.

00:26:30,122 --> 00:26:32,892
I mean, sooner or later,

00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:35,327
a relationship in stasis
withers.

00:26:35,394 --> 00:26:37,630
You get angry.

00:26:39,498 --> 00:26:41,901
You need more than the safety
of knowing

00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:44,270
that you're not alone.

00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:48,140
Then he should have
just walked away.

00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:50,609
Well, maybe he couldn't.

00:26:50,676 --> 00:26:55,614
Maybe he needed her
to leave him.

00:26:55,681 --> 00:26:58,751
Who are we talking about
right now?

00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:08,427
MAN:
<i>I'm going to count backwards</i>
<i>from ten to one.</i>

00:27:08,494 --> 00:27:11,230
When I get to one,
you'll be at work

00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:13,099
the day of the robbery.

00:27:13,165 --> 00:27:16,735
Ten... nine...

00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:21,740
eight... breathing...

00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:24,443
seven... six...

00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:27,513
getting closer...

00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:33,285
five, four...
breathing...

00:27:33,352 --> 00:27:36,822
three, two,

00:27:36,889 --> 00:27:38,991
one.

00:27:39,058 --> 00:27:41,093
Now, Grace,

00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,496
there's a man at your window.

00:27:43,562 --> 00:27:46,298
He has a beard
and baseball cap.

00:27:46,365 --> 00:27:48,267
Do you see him?

00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:50,536
What is he saying to you?

00:27:50,603 --> 00:27:52,938
He wants change
for two 50s.

00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:54,673
And what do you do?

00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:58,177
I give him a hundred singles.

00:27:59,245 --> 00:28:00,312
Surveillance showed

00:28:00,379 --> 00:28:01,480
hundreds on the right,

00:28:01,547 --> 00:28:02,815
singles on the left.

00:28:02,882 --> 00:28:04,650
She definitely gave him
hundreds.

00:28:04,717 --> 00:28:06,652
Does he say anything else
to you?

00:28:06,719 --> 00:28:09,822
I can't remember.

00:28:09,889 --> 00:28:13,959
Usually, the witnesses
I hypnotize for the department

00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:16,395
remember even tiny details.

00:28:16,462 --> 00:28:20,466
In my opinion, whoever
hypnotized her put a block in.

00:28:20,533 --> 00:28:22,468
What do you mean by a block?

00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:25,805
A command to keep her from
remembering what happened.

00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:27,973
So, you're saying this guy
can just roll

00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,543
into a crowded bank,
walk up to a teller

00:28:30,609 --> 00:28:32,745
and in 30 seconds,
look her in the eye

00:28:32,812 --> 00:28:33,979
tell her she's
getting sleepy

00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:35,581
and sloppy with her hundreds?

00:28:35,648 --> 00:28:37,082
You couldn't do it
in 30 seconds.

00:28:37,149 --> 00:28:38,551
But if there's a block,

00:28:38,617 --> 00:28:40,619
it wasn't the first time
he hypnotized her.

00:28:40,686 --> 00:28:42,455
During a prior session,

00:28:42,521 --> 00:28:44,623
he must have implanted a
post-hypnotic suggestion

00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:46,258
with a word

00:28:46,325 --> 00:28:48,527
or a phrase as a trigger.

00:28:48,594 --> 00:28:51,530
Could this post-hypnotic
suggestion

00:28:51,597 --> 00:28:53,032
get people
to do anything

00:28:53,099 --> 00:28:55,101
even if it's against
their moral code?

00:28:55,167 --> 00:28:57,269
It's all in the phrasing.

00:28:57,336 --> 00:28:58,971
You don't say
"Rob the bank."

00:28:59,038 --> 00:28:59,972
You say,

00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:03,275
"Liberate the money."

00:29:03,342 --> 00:29:05,044
So, anybody says,
"Liberate the money"

00:29:05,111 --> 00:29:07,646
and she sees hundreds as ones?

00:29:07,713 --> 00:29:09,248
No, it has to be
the same voice

00:29:09,315 --> 00:29:10,549
that planted the suggestion.

00:29:10,616 --> 00:29:13,018
She had a female hypnotist.

00:29:14,487 --> 00:29:18,491
We gotta get a better
description on this guy.

00:29:21,193 --> 00:29:23,796
The man with the baseball cap
is standing in front of you.

00:29:23,863 --> 00:29:26,966
What else do you
notice about him?

00:29:27,032 --> 00:29:32,571
Small hands.
Little sissy hands.

00:29:32,638 --> 00:29:34,573
Jacked-up fingernails.

00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:40,813
ARCHIE:
Maybe it's a fungus.

00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,081
I don't think
it's a fungus.

00:29:42,148 --> 00:29:43,349
I think it's a nail glue.

00:29:43,415 --> 00:29:44,683
That's how your nails look

00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,786
after you take off
the acrylic tips.

00:29:46,852 --> 00:29:48,654
When someone comes to me
for therapy,

00:29:48,721 --> 00:29:50,256
they have a goal.

00:29:50,322 --> 00:29:52,858
Archie, pull up the DMV photo

00:29:52,925 --> 00:29:54,493
of Viviana Conway.

00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,561
(typing)

00:29:56,695 --> 00:29:58,597
And now do

00:29:58,664 --> 00:29:59,799
a biometrics
comparison

00:29:59,865 --> 00:30:03,169
with the guy with
the funky nails.

00:30:16,182 --> 00:30:18,517
I figured out why Thorpe
was harassing the Adlers.

00:30:18,584 --> 00:30:21,887
Eight years ago,
the law was if
a victim dies,

00:30:21,954 --> 00:30:23,856
within a year
and a day from
an assault,

00:30:23,923 --> 00:30:26,525
the suspect can
still be charged
with the murder.
Right.

00:30:26,592 --> 00:30:28,494
We're working this case
as a murder.

00:30:28,561 --> 00:30:30,529
At least for the next year
and a day.

00:30:30,596 --> 00:30:32,631
And even then,
I'm still a juvie.

00:30:32,698 --> 00:30:34,600
According to D.A. Klein,
the law's changed.

00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:36,335
Nowadays,
if Pam Adler died,

00:30:36,402 --> 00:30:38,637
and her death
could be attributed
to the rape assault,

00:30:38,704 --> 00:30:41,440
Thorpe could be charged
with her murder at any time.

00:30:41,507 --> 00:30:44,677
So if Thorpe knew that,
he would have had motive
to terrorize Tom

00:30:44,743 --> 00:30:47,012
by making Tom believe
that he was raping Pam.

00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:48,848
Because if the husband
goes down for it,

00:30:48,914 --> 00:30:50,015
Thorpe's free and clear.

00:30:50,082 --> 00:30:51,550
It's murder by proxy.

00:30:51,617 --> 00:30:53,119
Thank you.

00:31:02,595 --> 00:31:06,365
Grissom, ALPR's got a hit
on Paul Bonfilio's car.

00:31:06,432 --> 00:31:09,235
We're sitting on it now.
I'll let you know.

00:31:09,301 --> 00:31:10,636
(keyless entry remote chirps)

00:31:10,703 --> 00:31:11,904
Excuse me, miss.

00:31:11,971 --> 00:31:13,506
Is that your car?

00:31:13,572 --> 00:31:14,874
I'm driving it.

00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,842
Then you're under arrest
for receiving stolen property...

00:31:16,909 --> 00:31:18,577
Hey, hey,
watch the nails!

00:31:18,644 --> 00:31:19,979
I didn't kidnap nobody.

00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:21,180
Where'd you get the car?

00:31:21,247 --> 00:31:22,117
Some dude.

00:31:22,117 --> 00:31:25,687
Hey, baby, want to taste
a little sugar?

00:31:25,754 --> 00:31:27,622
I don't do looky-loos.

00:31:27,689 --> 00:31:31,226
I'll give you
this car if you
drop her off for me.

00:31:31,293 --> 00:31:33,295
Some white boy with
real hair gives you a car,

00:31:33,361 --> 00:31:34,796
you don't say no.

00:31:34,863 --> 00:31:36,331
Well, then it's your lucky day.

00:31:36,398 --> 00:31:37,799
Where'd you drop her off?

00:31:37,866 --> 00:31:41,169
At Palermo.
They got the best buffet.

00:31:44,973 --> 00:31:47,509
WILLIAMS:
I need to pick up the child
this woman dropped off.

00:31:47,576 --> 00:31:48,510
Name?

00:31:48,577 --> 00:31:50,746
Trixie, Jr.

00:31:50,812 --> 00:31:52,180
DAY CARE WORKER:
You're over the four-hour limit.

00:31:52,247 --> 00:31:54,516
She made a couple
of stops.

00:31:54,583 --> 00:31:56,718
You're not supposed
to leave the casino.

00:31:56,785 --> 00:31:58,887
Bitch, can you not read
a situation?

00:31:58,954 --> 00:32:01,256
It ain't my real baby, stupid!

00:32:02,491 --> 00:32:04,426
(crying)
There you go.
There you go.

00:32:04,493 --> 00:32:07,129
Hey, hey...
that's okay,
I got him.

00:32:07,195 --> 00:32:08,497
Come here.
Here's your
big brother.

00:32:08,563 --> 00:32:09,931
Who's my good girl?

00:32:09,998 --> 00:32:11,266
Who's a good girl?

00:32:11,333 --> 00:32:13,168
I was so scared.
I was so scared.

00:32:13,235 --> 00:32:14,603
I missed you so much.

00:32:14,669 --> 00:32:15,971
Can I keep her?

00:32:16,037 --> 00:32:17,939
I'm 18.

00:32:18,006 --> 00:32:20,242
I've basically been taking care
of her since she was born.

00:32:20,308 --> 00:32:21,910
That's up to C.P.S.

00:32:21,977 --> 00:32:24,312
But I'll have my captain
put in a good word.

00:32:24,379 --> 00:32:26,648
MAN:
Now stage left.
Yeah.

00:32:26,715 --> 00:32:27,783
Yeah, that's it.

00:32:27,849 --> 00:32:29,718
It could have just looked
like teller error...

00:32:29,785 --> 00:32:31,353
twice.

00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,422
I know you're quite
the performer, but...

00:32:33,488 --> 00:32:35,357
in our business,
wearing a disguise

00:32:35,424 --> 00:32:37,325
is called consciousness
of guilt.

00:32:37,392 --> 00:32:39,261
I believe that's

00:32:39,327 --> 00:32:41,129
beta level consciousness.

00:32:43,298 --> 00:32:45,400
STOKES:
These people trusted you.

00:32:45,467 --> 00:32:47,135
And you got them fired
from their jobs.

00:32:47,202 --> 00:32:48,637
Why would you do
something like that?

00:32:48,703 --> 00:32:51,306
Because I could.

00:32:51,373 --> 00:32:53,475
I can't sing.

00:32:53,542 --> 00:32:56,178
I'm not a surgeon.

00:32:56,244 --> 00:32:58,580
But I have this gift.

00:32:58,647 --> 00:33:01,283
I have this energy
and this voice

00:33:01,349 --> 00:33:03,085
that makes people
feel very calm.

00:33:03,151 --> 00:33:05,854
Calm enough to get
inside their heads.

00:33:05,921 --> 00:33:07,622
You give me 20 minutes
with anyone,

00:33:07,689 --> 00:33:09,024
and I can put them under.

00:33:09,091 --> 00:33:12,160
Cops, soldiers, bank tellers.

00:33:12,227 --> 00:33:14,629
I mean, come on,
I had not one,

00:33:14,696 --> 00:33:17,299
but two clients
who were bank tellers.

00:33:17,365 --> 00:33:18,433
I had to try.

00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,068
Sprig Greniger is dead.

00:33:20,135 --> 00:33:23,004
We don't think
it was a suicide.

00:33:23,071 --> 00:33:25,273
Sprig wrote five
checks to you.

00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:27,843
According to her datebook,
she had six sessions.

00:33:27,909 --> 00:33:29,845
The last one was
the day she died.

00:33:29,911 --> 00:33:31,680
Explain that
to me.

00:33:31,747 --> 00:33:33,582
I gave her a free session.

00:33:33,648 --> 00:33:35,117
I mean, it was the least
I could do.

00:33:35,183 --> 00:33:37,452
Like you said, you know,
she'd just lost her job.

00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:39,121
Maybe she hadn't lost
her memory,

00:33:39,187 --> 00:33:40,689
and she was on to you.

00:33:40,756 --> 00:33:42,958
Hey, I've never even been
to Sprig's apartment.

00:33:43,024 --> 00:33:45,660
No, but you used the pay
phone across the street.

00:33:45,727 --> 00:33:47,229
Your prints are on it.

00:33:47,295 --> 00:33:48,864
WILLOWS:
All she needed to hear

00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:50,999
was the sound of your voice.

00:33:51,066 --> 00:33:53,502
(phone ringing)

00:33:53,568 --> 00:33:55,003
Hello.

00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:57,339
CONWAY:
It's time for your honeymoon.

00:34:01,343 --> 00:34:03,945
WILLOWS:
<i>She put on a bikini.</i>
<i>She grabbed a towel.</i>

00:34:04,012 --> 00:34:05,714
<i>She went out onto the balcony.</i>

00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:13,555
<i>You told her to picture herself</i>
<i>on a beach in Hawaii</i>

00:34:13,622 --> 00:34:17,159
<i>running across the sand,</i>
<i>feeling fit and confident.</i>

00:34:17,225 --> 00:34:20,429
<i>You told her to jump</i>
<i>into the water.</i>

00:34:22,731 --> 00:34:24,633
(crashing, glass shattering)

00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:27,736
(people yelling and screaming)

00:34:30,839 --> 00:34:33,875
You guys might have me
for bank robbery...

00:34:33,942 --> 00:34:36,178
but there is no way
that you can prove

00:34:36,244 --> 00:34:38,113
I had anything to do
with her death.

00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:39,681
It's like I told you--

00:34:39,748 --> 00:34:43,518
I cannot make people do anything
that they don't want to do.

00:34:43,585 --> 00:34:45,754
I can.

00:34:45,821 --> 00:34:47,989
Get in jail.

00:34:52,969 --> 00:34:57,140
Sara, they're
bringing Thorpe in now.

00:34:57,207 --> 00:35:00,444
Now look, I know you have
personal interest in this.

00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:02,245
But you're not
on the job anymore.

00:35:02,312 --> 00:35:03,413
I know.

00:35:07,184 --> 00:35:09,453
Tony.

00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:15,359
VEGA:
Remember me?

00:35:15,425 --> 00:35:16,626
Detective Vega.

00:35:16,693 --> 00:35:17,661
Well, screw you.

00:35:17,728 --> 00:35:18,996
I want a lawyer.

00:35:19,062 --> 00:35:20,731
I'm not charging you
with anything.

00:35:20,797 --> 00:35:21,798
I just want to talk.

00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,701
How'd you end up
with the wheels?

00:35:24,768 --> 00:35:28,538
Pepper Street doing
some bad shots.

00:35:28,605 --> 00:35:30,440
I'm too tough to die.
How long ago?

00:35:30,507 --> 00:35:32,309
Last Christmas.

00:35:39,416 --> 00:35:41,218
WILLIAMS:
So this is what we got.

00:35:41,284 --> 00:35:44,554
We found your prints
all over Paula Bonfilio's car.

00:35:44,621 --> 00:35:48,291
So tell me, Leon,

00:35:48,358 --> 00:35:50,127
how'd you bust up
your hands?

00:35:50,193 --> 00:35:52,929
Can't remember.

00:35:52,996 --> 00:35:54,531
Picking blueberries, I think.

00:35:54,598 --> 00:35:56,299
Oh.

00:35:56,366 --> 00:35:59,403
How much did Paula owe you?

00:35:59,469 --> 00:36:01,905
Lending money to those who
need it isn't against the law.

00:36:01,972 --> 00:36:04,641
But killing them
if they can't pay up is.

00:36:04,708 --> 00:36:06,743
All you got left

00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:08,211
is the baby
and the car!

00:36:08,278 --> 00:36:10,414
Pay me right now
or I take them!

00:36:11,381 --> 00:36:13,016
(both grunting)

00:36:15,185 --> 00:36:16,953
Yeah, I roughed her up.

00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:20,424
And yeah, I unburdened her
of her car and her baby.

00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:23,660
But when I left her in that
alley, she was completely alive.

00:36:23,727 --> 00:36:24,895
Then why not unburden her

00:36:24,961 --> 00:36:26,297
of that 500-dollar chip
she had in her purse?

00:36:26,297 --> 00:36:27,732
Lady owed me 12,000 bucks.

00:36:27,799 --> 00:36:30,001
$500 barely covers the interest.

00:36:30,068 --> 00:36:33,459
You got to tough-love
these junkie twits

00:36:33,459 --> 00:36:34,627
or they never pay up.

00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:36,896
I swear

00:36:36,962 --> 00:36:39,265
on my professional oath,

00:36:39,331 --> 00:36:42,902
I was going to give her
the car and the baby back.

00:36:42,968 --> 00:36:44,637
Then why give them
to the hooker?

00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:47,573
That was just after I saw
that crap on the news.

00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,676
Kid's cool, right?

00:36:50,869 --> 00:36:52,437
I didn't kill her.

00:36:58,076 --> 00:36:59,844
We, uh...

00:36:59,911 --> 00:37:01,813
found Thorpe.

00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:04,950
Why did you lie to me, Tom?

00:37:10,722 --> 00:37:15,327
I can't win for losing.

00:37:15,393 --> 00:37:18,997
People told me I was selfish
keeping her alive for so long.

00:37:19,064 --> 00:37:22,601
And now look at me.

00:37:22,667 --> 00:37:26,137
Mostly I was pissed
that he's out walking around.

00:37:26,204 --> 00:37:28,907
And whenever I wasn't working
or paying for her care,

00:37:28,974 --> 00:37:30,642
I was just sitting
by that bed.

00:37:30,709 --> 00:37:32,811
After a while,

00:37:32,877 --> 00:37:39,351
I realized the only one who was
feeling any suffering... was me.

00:37:39,417 --> 00:37:42,654
I just
wasn't living.

00:37:42,721 --> 00:37:47,025
I just couldn't move on
and leave her there like that.

00:37:47,092 --> 00:37:50,595
You could have asked
the doctors to help you.

00:37:50,662 --> 00:37:52,564
By telling them what?

00:37:52,631 --> 00:37:55,600
That I was tired?

00:37:55,667 --> 00:37:58,203
I wanted them
to kill my wife

00:37:58,270 --> 00:38:02,474
so that I could have
a weekend to myself?

00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:05,343
At least that would
have been honest.

00:38:07,045 --> 00:38:09,347
(phone ringing)

00:38:09,414 --> 00:38:12,217
Archie Johnson.

00:38:12,284 --> 00:38:15,587
Someone tried to cash that chip?

00:38:15,654 --> 00:38:18,056
Yeah, send it over. Thanks.

00:38:28,233 --> 00:38:30,635
Grissom.

00:38:30,702 --> 00:38:33,571
(Lexi crying)

00:38:52,177 --> 00:38:53,245
This looks like

00:38:53,312 --> 00:38:55,247
the same gold link strap
I found

00:38:55,314 --> 00:38:57,249
at the scene.

00:38:57,316 --> 00:38:59,084
And there's blood on it.

00:38:59,151 --> 00:39:00,486
Honey...

00:39:00,552 --> 00:39:03,122
GRISSOM:
<i>Paula called Scott</i>
<i>around 10:00.</i>

00:39:03,188 --> 00:39:04,132
<i>Maybe she needed his help.</i>

00:39:04,132 --> 00:39:05,800
I screwed up... big time.

00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:08,087
(tires squealing)

00:39:08,153 --> 00:39:09,455
Where's Lexi?

00:39:09,521 --> 00:39:10,823
Don't be upset.
I can fix this.

00:39:10,889 --> 00:39:13,759
No! Are you out of your mind?!
Just tell me where Lexi is.

00:39:13,826 --> 00:39:16,628
He won't give her back
until we give him the money!
How could you do this?!

00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:37,082
This might
explain the rage.

00:39:38,951 --> 00:39:42,154
GRISSOM:
He was Oedipus.

00:39:42,221 --> 00:39:44,990
SIMMS:
<i>I was just running</i>
<i>the DNA profiles,</i>

00:39:45,057 --> 00:39:46,392
and Paula and Scott Bonfilio

00:39:46,458 --> 00:39:47,960
don't have
any markers in common.

00:39:48,027 --> 00:39:49,762
I mean, these two are
definitely not mother and son.

00:39:49,828 --> 00:39:51,130
And I checked for
adoption records

00:39:51,196 --> 00:39:53,098
and foster records for Scott,
and there's nothing.

00:39:53,165 --> 00:39:54,566
Now, Lexi, on the other hand,

00:39:54,633 --> 00:39:56,669
shares markers at every
locus with both of them.

00:39:56,735 --> 00:39:58,404
So she's their kid?

00:39:58,470 --> 00:39:59,805
Yeah.

00:39:59,872 --> 00:40:01,640
Now, according to Paula's
employment record,

00:40:01,707 --> 00:40:04,510
they've only been living
in Vegas for a little
over two years.

00:40:04,576 --> 00:40:07,212
So the child was conceived
before they got here.

00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:09,748
Which means that Scott
was 15 years old.

00:40:09,815 --> 00:40:11,850
This also says that
her previous place
of employment

00:40:11,917 --> 00:40:14,353
was Archfield High School
in Akron, Ohio.

00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:16,388
Scott was her student.

00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:19,958
And his fingerprints are in
the missing children's database.

00:40:20,025 --> 00:40:21,293
(sighs)

00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:27,099
She didn't kidnap me,

00:40:27,166 --> 00:40:29,134
but I became her hostage.

00:40:29,201 --> 00:40:31,403
Why didn't you
call your parents?

00:40:33,772 --> 00:40:37,476
That's like switching
arsenic for cyanide.

00:40:37,543 --> 00:40:40,546
They'd never
let me keep Lexi.

00:40:40,612 --> 00:40:42,514
Someone cared enough about you

00:40:42,581 --> 00:40:44,616
to put you in
the missing kids' database.

00:40:44,683 --> 00:40:47,319
My alkie dad was missing
his cigarette runner.

00:40:47,386 --> 00:40:49,621
That's hardly love.

00:40:49,688 --> 00:40:52,124
But you and Paula...

00:40:52,191 --> 00:40:54,793
She was my guidance counselor.

00:40:56,795 --> 00:41:00,099
She listened to all my problems.

00:41:00,165 --> 00:41:04,069
It was the first time
I felt heard.

00:41:04,136 --> 00:41:07,573
Then it all
went to hell.

00:41:07,639 --> 00:41:11,143
I got too old for her.

00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:14,113
(sniffles)
She only liked me
when I was risky.

00:41:14,179 --> 00:41:18,951
As soon as the naughty
faded away...

00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:22,521
she started seeking risk
anywhere else she could.

00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:32,564
I was just trying
to start a... a better life.

00:41:32,631 --> 00:41:35,968
To make a family.

00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:39,238
And then she gave away our baby
for a gambling debt.

00:41:39,304 --> 00:41:40,806
(screaming)
(grunting)

00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:41,874
(squishing)

00:41:43,609 --> 00:41:47,012
Have you ever loved
someone so much

00:41:47,079 --> 00:41:48,614
that you would kill for them?

00:41:52,351 --> 00:41:54,420
I do.

00:41:54,486 --> 00:41:57,790
And even if Lexi
can't be with me,

00:41:57,856 --> 00:42:00,192
she's better off without her.

00:42:07,099 --> 00:42:10,336
and then she took it all away.
