00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,169
(door slams shut)

00:00:06,289 --> 00:00:09,793
JEREMY KENT:
<i>I never did get to tell</i>
<i>my side of the story.</i>

00:00:09,859 --> 00:00:13,330
<i>I was accused of a crime</i>
<i>I did not commit,</i>

00:00:13,396 --> 00:00:14,698
<i>I was held without bail</i>

00:00:14,764 --> 00:00:17,000
<i>in the East Clark County</i>
<i>Detention Center,</i>

00:00:17,067 --> 00:00:19,169
<i>awaiting trial.</i>

00:00:19,236 --> 00:00:21,638
<i>I'd never been to jail before.</i>

00:00:21,705 --> 00:00:23,707
<i>It's not a place</i>
<i>you want to be.</i>

00:00:31,982 --> 00:00:33,850
(door buzzing)

00:00:33,917 --> 00:00:35,952
(door slams shut)

00:00:36,019 --> 00:00:37,921
<i>The prosecution</i>
<i>called on my cellmate</i>

00:00:37,988 --> 00:00:39,322
<i>to testify against me.</i>

00:00:39,389 --> 00:00:42,158
<i>He told them that</i>
<i>I had confessed to the murder</i>

00:00:42,225 --> 00:00:43,426
<i>of Thomas Harrot.</i>

00:00:43,493 --> 00:00:44,794
<i>It was a lie.</i>

00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,865
<i>In exchange for his testimony,</i>

00:00:48,932 --> 00:00:51,701
<i>my cellmate got</i>
<i>a suspended sentence.</i>

00:00:51,768 --> 00:00:54,004
<i>I wanted to take the stand,</i>

00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:56,406
<i>but my public defender</i>
<i>told me it was a bad idea,</i>

00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:57,874
<i>and I trusted him.</i>

00:00:57,941 --> 00:00:59,743
(chuckles)

00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:01,811
<i>I thought jail was hell.</i>

00:01:01,878 --> 00:01:04,681
<i>Then I got to the state pen.</i>

00:01:04,748 --> 00:01:07,317
<i>I've been there for 18 years.</i>

00:01:07,384 --> 00:01:10,120
<i>After being denied parole</i>
<i>in 2000,</i>

00:01:10,186 --> 00:01:12,255
<i>I began studying the law.</i>

00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:14,357
<i>I figured if nobody</i>
<i>was gonna help me,</i>

00:01:14,424 --> 00:01:16,359
<i>I had to do it myself.</i>

00:01:16,426 --> 00:01:19,496
<i>And I discovered there were</i>
<i>a lot of other innocent men</i>

00:01:19,563 --> 00:01:21,464
<i>like me in prison.</i>

00:01:21,531 --> 00:01:25,168
<i>There were new ways</i>
<i>to prove that.</i>

00:01:26,937 --> 00:01:30,807
<i>Then two years ago,</i>
<i>I ran into my cellmate again,</i>

00:01:30,874 --> 00:01:34,311
<i>and he revealed to me</i>
<i>that the testimony against me</i>

00:01:34,377 --> 00:01:36,246
<i>had been his lawyer's idea.</i>

00:01:36,313 --> 00:01:37,581
(groans)

00:01:37,647 --> 00:01:38,582
(clamoring voices)

00:01:38,648 --> 00:01:40,584
GUARD:
Everybody on the ground!

00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:42,152
<i>That's when I discovered</i>

00:01:42,219 --> 00:01:45,088
<i>that we had the same lawyer--</i>

00:01:45,155 --> 00:01:48,191
<i>the late Benjamin Tripp,</i>
<i>Esquire.</i>

00:01:52,162 --> 00:01:55,031
Your Honors,
my court-appointed lawyer

00:01:55,098 --> 00:01:57,000
conspired against me,

00:01:57,067 --> 00:01:59,903
and the county prosecutor
just looked the other way.

00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:02,539
Now, this was more
than a conflict of interest.

00:02:02,606 --> 00:02:04,541
This was collusion.

00:02:04,608 --> 00:02:06,810
18 years ago,

00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:11,381
I was denied my constitutional
right to a fair trial.

00:02:11,448 --> 00:02:16,052
Under the law, I'm entitled
to have my day in court.

00:02:16,119 --> 00:02:20,190
WILLOWS:
<i>It was 1991, the night</i>
<i>of the Rampart Casino fire.</i>

00:02:20,257 --> 00:02:22,192
<i>My first solo.</i>

00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:25,195
<i>The victim, Thomas Harrot,</i>

00:02:25,262 --> 00:02:29,032
<i>called 911 to report</i>
<i>an intruder in his house.</i>

00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:32,202
<i>He was 91 years old</i>
<i>and he lived alone.</i>

00:02:32,269 --> 00:02:35,372
<i>First officer on the scene</i>
<i>found him down on the floor.</i>

00:02:35,438 --> 00:02:38,441
<i>Blunt-force trauma to the head.</i>

00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:42,512
<i>A rock was used</i>
<i>to break a window,</i>

00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:45,749
<i>and that appeared to be</i>
<i>the point of entry.</i>

00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:56,192
<i>The State Supreme Court</i>
<i>has granted Jeremy Kent</i>

00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:57,694
<i>a new trial.</i>

00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:59,362
<i>The standards and documentation</i>

00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,798
<i>have changed substantially</i>
<i>since '91,</i>

00:03:01,865 --> 00:03:04,801
<i>so we're going to reexamine</i>
<i>all my old evidence.</i>

00:03:04,868 --> 00:03:06,970
<i>The house was demo'd</i>
<i>six months ago,</i>

00:03:07,037 --> 00:03:08,805
<i>but I still have</i>
<i>the crime scene sketch,</i>

00:03:08,872 --> 00:03:10,707
<i>so I can walk you through it.</i>

00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:11,741
The house is dark.

00:03:11,808 --> 00:03:14,678
There's no car
out front.

00:03:14,744 --> 00:03:15,912
Mr. Harrot

00:03:15,979 --> 00:03:18,048
hadn't driven since he was 85.

00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:20,083
So, to Kent,

00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,118
the place must've
looked empty.

00:03:22,185 --> 00:03:24,154
STOKES:
Well, it says here
two nearby houses

00:03:24,221 --> 00:03:26,623
were also burglarized
around the same time.

00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:28,291
The first one
was on Crawford,

00:03:28,358 --> 00:03:30,860
and the second one
on Skidmore.

00:03:30,927 --> 00:03:32,362
Lights out.

00:03:32,429 --> 00:03:34,064
No cars.

00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,099
And a rock used
to break the window.

00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:38,301
A witness on Crawford
saw a man

00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,970
running down the driveway.

00:03:40,036 --> 00:03:41,972
Recognized him
as a neighborhood kid

00:03:42,038 --> 00:03:43,873
and picked Kent out of a lineup.

00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,775
Other than the rocks,
was there any evidence of Kent

00:03:45,842 --> 00:03:47,110
at the other two houses?

00:03:47,177 --> 00:03:50,614
No. The only physical evidence
that led to the suspect

00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,182
was the print on the rock

00:03:52,249 --> 00:03:54,184
that I found
right here.

00:03:54,251 --> 00:03:56,987
Kent came here
to burg the place.

00:03:57,053 --> 00:04:00,991
Yeah, and his plans changed
when he ran into Mr. Harrot.

00:04:01,057 --> 00:04:02,192
Get out of my house!

00:04:02,259 --> 00:04:04,227
(grunting)

00:04:07,797 --> 00:04:08,832
Old man.

00:04:08,899 --> 00:04:10,834
Half deaf. Half blind.

00:04:10,901 --> 00:04:13,169
Mr. Harrot wasn't a threat.

00:04:13,236 --> 00:04:15,205
There was no need to kill him.

00:04:15,272 --> 00:04:16,773
I always thought
that tipped the jury.

00:04:18,275 --> 00:04:19,576
Did you recover
a murder weapon?

00:04:19,643 --> 00:04:21,244
No.

00:04:21,311 --> 00:04:22,479
But the depression fractures

00:04:22,545 --> 00:04:24,314
on the victim's skull
suggested a hammer.

00:04:24,381 --> 00:04:26,516
Follow me.

00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,184
So, there's
an alley here.

00:04:28,251 --> 00:04:32,022
There was obviously a number
of shoe impressions

00:04:32,088 --> 00:04:35,025
that evening, but this
particular one

00:04:35,091 --> 00:04:37,227
was right here.

00:04:37,294 --> 00:04:39,262
It was unique because

00:04:39,329 --> 00:04:41,565
it was fresh
and it was facing the fence.

00:04:41,631 --> 00:04:44,367
Now, Harrot's
neighbors

00:04:44,434 --> 00:04:46,102
reported that their motion light

00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:47,170
came on.

00:04:47,237 --> 00:04:48,872
So, I figured that
maybe the suspect

00:04:48,939 --> 00:04:49,973
jumped the fence.

00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,975
So, I searched the yard.

00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:54,010
I didn't find any shoe
impressions

00:04:54,077 --> 00:04:55,545
on the other side of the fence.

00:04:55,612 --> 00:04:58,882
So, all you had was
an eyewitness

00:04:58,949 --> 00:05:00,550
who was a half a mile away,

00:05:00,617 --> 00:05:03,820
testimony from Jeremy
Kent's ex-cellmate,

00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:07,090
and a single fingerprint
from a rock.

00:05:07,157 --> 00:05:08,959
Back then it was enough.

00:05:09,025 --> 00:05:10,627
You got it figured out?

00:05:10,694 --> 00:05:13,563
Legal just put
this on my desk.

00:05:19,436 --> 00:05:20,437
(wry chuckle)

00:05:20,503 --> 00:05:22,973
I've been subpoenaed
by Jeremy Kent.

00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,741
He's requesting

00:05:24,808 --> 00:05:26,810
a pretrial conference.

00:05:26,876 --> 00:05:28,578
Yeah, he probably wants
to talk to you

00:05:28,645 --> 00:05:31,281
about how he got life
based on a rock.

(loud bang, glass shatters)

OPERATOR:
911. What's your emergency?

00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:18,520
Someone tried
to get in my house.

00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:21,156
Are they still there, sir? Sir?
(door opening)

00:06:21,223 --> 00:06:23,459
I hear someone
in the other room.

00:06:23,525 --> 00:06:25,227
I need the police.
I'm all alone.

00:06:25,294 --> 00:06:27,262
What is your address?

00:06:27,329 --> 00:06:29,865
HARROT:
901 West Westcroft. Hurry.

00:06:29,932 --> 00:06:32,167
OPERATOR:
I'm dispatching a unit.
Please remain on the phone, sir.


00:06:32,234 --> 00:06:33,202
HARROT:
I'll be right back.


00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:34,536
OPERATOR:
No, sir...


00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:37,139
HARROT:
I'm going to see
who's out there.


00:06:37,206 --> 00:06:38,741
Be right back.
Sir!


00:06:38,807 --> 00:06:39,843
Stay with me, sir...


00:06:39,843 --> 00:06:41,277
When the first officers arrived,


00:06:41,344 --> 00:06:42,846
the phone was still
off the hook.


00:06:42,912 --> 00:06:45,615
Does that mean we have
the murder on tape?
No.


00:06:45,682 --> 00:06:47,450
The victim's bedroom
faced the street,


00:06:47,517 --> 00:06:50,453
so all we've got
is a lot of sirens passing by.


00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,021
Figure they were going
to the fire.


00:06:52,088 --> 00:06:54,224
Fortunately,
audio analysis


00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:56,126
has come a long way since '91.


00:06:56,192 --> 00:06:57,527
(video rewinding)


00:06:57,594 --> 00:06:59,229
Be right back.
(phone clunks,
distant sirens wailing)


00:06:59,295 --> 00:07:00,497
Play it again.


00:07:00,563 --> 00:07:01,531
Be right back.
(phone clunks)


00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:02,565
OPERATOR:
Sir?


00:07:02,632 --> 00:07:04,100
Stay with me, sir...


00:07:04,167 --> 00:07:06,403
Listen to the low end
of the frequency.
Does that sound


00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:07,837
like an engine to you?


00:07:07,904 --> 00:07:09,339
Yeah.


00:07:09,406 --> 00:07:11,207
I think I can isolate
and amplify that.


00:07:11,274 --> 00:07:13,209
(beeping)


00:07:13,276 --> 00:07:15,879
(engine idling)


00:07:15,945 --> 00:07:17,914
It's closer to the phone
than the sirens.


00:07:17,981 --> 00:07:19,749
So, it had to be right outside
the bedroom.


00:07:19,816 --> 00:07:21,484
Three minutes
into the call?


00:07:21,551 --> 00:07:24,554
Cops didn't arrive
for almost 25.


00:07:24,621 --> 00:07:25,655
Can you match that engine


00:07:25,722 --> 00:07:26,823
to a specific
make and model?


00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:28,224
Like the, uh, suspect's


00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:31,227
1984 Pontiac 6000?


00:07:31,294 --> 00:07:32,762
I can try.


00:07:32,829 --> 00:07:33,763
(groans)


00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:37,000
Two depressed
circular fractures


00:07:37,067 --> 00:07:39,436
of the frontal skull.


00:07:39,502 --> 00:07:42,305
Sam Barnard conducted
the autopsy.


00:07:42,372 --> 00:07:44,340
Minimal documentation.


00:07:44,407 --> 00:07:47,343
Listed COD
as intracranial hemorrhaging.


00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:49,212
Can we call Dr. Barnard
for a consult?


00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:51,247
Passed away in '98.


00:07:51,314 --> 00:07:54,184
Loved chili dogs,
but his arteries didn't.


00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:57,787
All right, two fractured ribs
on the left side.


00:07:57,854 --> 00:07:59,823
A third fracture
on the right,


00:07:59,889 --> 00:08:01,858
and a dislocation
from the vertebral column.


00:08:01,925 --> 00:08:04,694
Barnard attributed
all of these other injuries


00:08:04,761 --> 00:08:07,397
to the fall after the attack.


00:08:07,464 --> 00:08:09,065
That's ridiculous.


00:08:09,132 --> 00:08:11,401
A 90-year-old man may have bones
like eggshells,


00:08:11,468 --> 00:08:12,802
but he can't possibly fall


00:08:12,869 --> 00:08:16,606
on his left side and his right
side at the same time.


00:08:16,673 --> 00:08:18,975
Logic dictates
that the thoracic injuries


00:08:19,042 --> 00:08:21,244
were sustained
prior to the head blow.


00:08:21,311 --> 00:08:24,447
Beaten, then killed.


00:08:26,649 --> 00:08:29,786
You couldn't get away
with this quality of work today.


00:08:29,853 --> 00:08:31,121
Hey.


00:08:31,187 --> 00:08:33,156
I dug up the original
ME's notes.


00:08:33,223 --> 00:08:35,058
And what did the good doctor
have to say


00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:37,794
about the hairline fractures
to the femur and the tibia?


00:08:37,861 --> 00:08:39,496
He described them
as age-related, osteoporotic


00:08:39,562 --> 00:08:41,498
degeneration.


00:08:41,564 --> 00:08:44,701
They could've just as easily
been caused by a struggle.


00:08:47,637 --> 00:08:50,240
At the time you investigated
the Harrot murder,


00:08:50,306 --> 00:08:53,743
how long had you been employed
by Las Vegas PD?


00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:54,944
18 months.


00:08:55,011 --> 00:08:56,579
Oh, that's all?


00:08:56,646 --> 00:08:58,615
Prior


00:08:58,681 --> 00:09:00,250
to the Thomas Harrot murder,


00:09:00,316 --> 00:09:02,285
you always worked
under a supervisor?


00:09:02,352 --> 00:09:03,586
Yes.
So,


00:09:03,653 --> 00:09:06,790
this case was your first
unsupervised investigation?


00:09:06,856 --> 00:09:08,458
It was my first solo case.


00:09:08,525 --> 00:09:10,994
But all my casework was reviewed
by my supervisor.
Well,


00:09:11,061 --> 00:09:13,096
regardless, it was in your best
interest to get a conviction?


00:09:13,163 --> 00:09:14,964
I don't deal in convictions.
That's for the jury.


00:09:15,031 --> 00:09:17,534
Still...


00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,536
worked out pretty good for you.


00:09:19,602 --> 00:09:21,538
Better than it did for me.


00:09:21,604 --> 00:09:22,872
Is that a question?


00:09:22,939 --> 00:09:25,875
Oh, I'm sorry if I'm wasting
your time here.

00:09:25,942 --> 00:09:28,545
It's just I've been in here
for 18 years

00:09:28,611 --> 00:09:30,113
for something I didn't do.

00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,347
So, all I've got is time.

00:09:31,414 --> 00:09:33,349
You know, I met
a drug dealer

00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:35,852
in here who knew your husband,
Eddie Willows.

00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:37,854
Apparently, he was a
very good customer.

00:09:37,921 --> 00:09:39,322
I heard he died.

00:09:39,389 --> 00:09:41,357
My condolences.

00:09:41,424 --> 00:09:43,359
I'm sorry,
what was the question?

00:09:43,426 --> 00:09:45,929
Were you taking any drugs,
legal or illegal,

00:09:45,995 --> 00:09:47,864
at the time you were processing
this crime scene?

00:09:47,931 --> 00:09:49,132
No.
Was it

00:09:49,199 --> 00:09:50,834
because you were pregnant?
How is your daughter?

00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,202
How is that relevant?

00:09:52,268 --> 00:09:53,870
Oh, I'm laying a foundation.

00:09:53,937 --> 00:09:57,707
That's how we refer to it
in the legal community.

00:09:57,774 --> 00:10:00,710
Now, having a child
is a life-altering experience.

00:10:00,777 --> 00:10:03,646
Did your pregnancy influence
your judgment?

00:10:03,713 --> 00:10:04,681
No.

00:10:04,748 --> 00:10:08,017
So, your condition didn't impose

00:10:08,084 --> 00:10:10,587
any-any limits to the chemicals
you could use

00:10:10,653 --> 00:10:12,622
in processing the crime scene?

00:10:12,689 --> 00:10:14,624
No, all the evidence I collected
was bagged and tagged,

00:10:14,691 --> 00:10:17,160
and all the tests were conducted
by the experts.

00:10:17,227 --> 00:10:19,496
Who, like yourself,
are all employees

00:10:19,562 --> 00:10:21,498
of the Las Vegas
Police Department

00:10:21,564 --> 00:10:22,832
and, therefore, inclined

00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:25,835
to give their employer
the answers they want.

00:10:25,902 --> 00:10:28,338
I don't trust your lab results.

00:10:28,405 --> 00:10:30,173
WILLOWS: <i>Which is why you can</i>
<i>exercise your right</i>

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,908
<i>to hire the expert</i>
<i>of your choosing</i>

00:10:31,975 --> 00:10:33,743
<i>to reexamine the evidence.</i>

00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:35,745
KENT:
<i>Right, at my own expense.</i>

00:10:35,812 --> 00:10:37,047
<i>You see, I haven't earned</i>

00:10:37,113 --> 00:10:39,883
<i>that much money</i>
<i>in the last 18 years.</i>

00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:50,560
Hey.

00:10:50,627 --> 00:10:52,228
I got the blood exemplar
for Thomas Harrot

00:10:52,295 --> 00:10:53,596
from cold storage,

00:10:53,663 --> 00:10:55,231
but the lab wasn't
doing DNA back then,

00:10:55,298 --> 00:10:57,867
so Catherine's got to get a
buccal sample from the suspect.

00:10:58,902 --> 00:11:00,737
What are you looking for?

00:11:00,804 --> 00:11:02,272
The blood stains
that Catherine analyzed

00:11:02,338 --> 00:11:04,107
are consistent with the victim,

00:11:04,174 --> 00:11:08,445
but the lab didn't have ALS
until 1995.

00:11:08,511 --> 00:11:10,480
So, I'm thinking
it's possible

00:11:10,547 --> 00:11:12,215
that there was an area

00:11:12,282 --> 00:11:14,050
of non-visible blood
from the suspect

00:11:14,117 --> 00:11:15,585
that Catherine couldn't see.

00:11:15,652 --> 00:11:17,087
Hmm.

00:11:31,868 --> 00:11:33,303
What does that look like to you?

00:11:33,369 --> 00:11:36,439
SIMMS:
A giant sperm cell.

00:11:36,506 --> 00:11:39,442
Maybe a big comma.

00:11:54,557 --> 00:11:58,461
Catherine never recovered
the murder weapon,

00:11:58,528 --> 00:12:00,764
but she always suspected
that it was a hammer.

00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:03,066
KENT:
<i>Speaking of evidence,</i>

00:12:03,133 --> 00:12:06,269
per the ASCLD regulations,

00:12:06,336 --> 00:12:08,071
all current evidence
examinations

00:12:08,138 --> 00:12:11,307
must meet the 2009
forensic standards.

00:12:11,374 --> 00:12:12,976
You've done your homework.

00:12:13,042 --> 00:12:15,645
Which brings me to the only
physical piece of evidence

00:12:15,712 --> 00:12:19,382
we have in this case,
which is item number CW-2,

00:12:19,449 --> 00:12:21,017
the rock which you claim
you found

00:12:21,084 --> 00:12:23,920
in Mr. Harrot's living room.

00:12:23,987 --> 00:12:26,823
Now, I was convicted

00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:29,692
on a five point of minutia
match,

00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:31,127
which,

00:12:31,194 --> 00:12:34,931
per ASCLD regulations,
is far from conclusive today.

00:12:34,998 --> 00:12:36,199
Which makes the print

00:12:36,266 --> 00:12:38,368
more prejudicial
than probative.

00:12:38,435 --> 00:12:41,137
I maintain that
that print belongs

00:12:41,204 --> 00:12:43,173
to the real killer
of Thomas Harrot.

00:12:43,239 --> 00:12:45,742
And I am filing a motion
with the court

00:12:45,809 --> 00:12:49,279
to have the rock excluded.

00:12:49,345 --> 00:12:51,514
Have you got anything else?

00:12:51,581 --> 00:12:52,882
Yes or no?

00:12:58,876 --> 00:13:00,878
(car door shuts,
car remote chirps)

00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:04,148
Hey, we got a big problem.

00:13:04,215 --> 00:13:06,784

physical evidence

00:13:10,588 --> 00:13:12,256

to the crime scene.

00:13:12,323 --> 00:13:14,258
Ah, the infamous
rock, huh?

00:13:14,325 --> 00:13:17,127
Yeah. ADA says that
it could be up to the judge.

00:13:17,194 --> 00:13:19,330
Was your ridge structure
faded or broken?

00:13:19,396 --> 00:13:21,165
How strong are your points
of identification?

00:13:21,232 --> 00:13:24,034
Well, strong enough to confirm
an ID and get a conviction.

00:13:24,101 --> 00:13:25,336
Catherine.
Okay.

00:13:25,402 --> 00:13:26,737
It wasn't a road map.

00:13:26,804 --> 00:13:28,272
It was a difficult comparison.

00:13:28,339 --> 00:13:31,375
Then let's not take a
chance on losing this.

00:13:31,442 --> 00:13:32,710
Oh, I know. I know.

00:13:32,776 --> 00:13:34,712

00:14:44,682 --> 00:14:48,919
I developed a unique pattern
within the core

00:14:48,986 --> 00:14:51,255

to Kent's ten card print.

00:14:51,322 --> 00:14:53,390

that the toe exerted
more pressure than the heel.

the case

00:19:35,139 --> 00:19:38,542
<i>Quercus agrifolia--</i>
desert oak-- grows about

00:19:38,609 --> 00:19:40,644
six to eight inches
a year, which means that

00:19:40,711 --> 00:19:45,149
your tree probably grew
about nine feet in 18 years.

00:19:45,216 --> 00:19:47,885
A bark collar
grew around the hammer

00:19:47,952 --> 00:19:49,920
during that period of time,
which confirms

00:19:49,987 --> 00:19:52,523
that the hammer was in the tree
for many years.

00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:55,893
And therefore, no one can
accuse you of planting it.

00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,195
Pardon the pun.

00:19:58,262 --> 00:20:00,030
Unfortunately,

00:20:00,097 --> 00:20:02,533
the scientific improbability
of getting a viable print

00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,236
or DNA is a completely
separate issue,

00:20:05,302 --> 00:20:08,639
but... I'll back you.

00:20:09,673 --> 00:20:11,675
Good to know.

00:20:14,445 --> 00:20:16,814
Hey, Catherine.
Did you get any
usable prints

00:20:16,881 --> 00:20:17,982
off the hammer?

00:20:18,048 --> 00:20:19,150
Yeah. Two.

00:20:19,216 --> 00:20:21,285
Neither one of them is a match
to Jeremy Kent.

00:20:21,352 --> 00:20:22,453
What?

00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,787
Yeah, I did
a visual comparison.

00:20:23,854 --> 00:20:24,955
Mandy peer reviewed.

00:20:25,022 --> 00:20:27,625
I'm sorry, Catherine.

00:20:27,691 --> 00:20:30,027
It just... It isn't him.

00:20:35,209 --> 00:20:36,610
ECKLIE:
<i>When Kent discovers</i>

00:20:36,677 --> 00:20:37,778
you found the
murder weapon

00:20:37,844 --> 00:20:39,112
with someone else's
prints on it,

00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:41,114
he's going to fast track
himself to an acquittal.

00:20:41,181 --> 00:20:42,749
We have the print
on the rock,

00:20:42,816 --> 00:20:44,384
which still puts him
at the scene.

00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:46,220
But Kent's prints
aren't on the hammer.

00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:47,788
So, clearly,
there was an accomplice

00:20:47,854 --> 00:20:49,156
who probably committed
the murder.

00:20:49,223 --> 00:20:50,991
Yeah. Who we still
need to identify.

00:20:51,058 --> 00:20:52,159
Obviously.

00:20:52,226 --> 00:20:53,860
Okay, pretrial hearing
is in 48 hours.

00:20:53,927 --> 00:20:55,796
You're gonna have to
reveal the prints then.

00:20:55,862 --> 00:20:58,465
It would be nice if Kent
would give us a name.

00:20:58,532 --> 00:20:59,633
Yeah, well, why would he?

00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,535
He's kept it a secret
for 18 years.

00:21:01,602 --> 00:21:02,836
Then ask
without asking.

00:21:02,903 --> 00:21:04,872
Sweat him with
the rock evidence.

00:21:04,938 --> 00:21:07,274
VANDERPOOL:
<i>The judge denied your motion.</i>

00:21:07,341 --> 00:21:08,909
The rock's back in play.

00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:11,578
WILLOWS:
I reexamined the rock.

00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:14,414
I enhanced the fingerprint
and photoed it.

00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:16,216
And this time around,

00:21:16,283 --> 00:21:20,254
I found several
highly unique points

00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,689
of comparison, including this

00:21:22,756 --> 00:21:24,458
happy face pattern,

00:21:24,524 --> 00:21:26,560
which is an exact match
to your print.

00:21:26,627 --> 00:21:30,764
VANDERPOOL:
And that print puts you
at the crime scene.

00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:31,965
You were there.

00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:34,301
You killed Thomas Harrot.

00:21:34,368 --> 00:21:36,770
WILLOWS:
Mr. Kent, if there's
another explanation,

00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:39,106
other than the obvious,

00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:40,707
now would be a good time
to come clean.

00:21:40,774 --> 00:21:43,443
(scoffs)

00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,245
Once you're wearing these,

00:21:45,312 --> 00:21:47,381
nobody believes
anything that you have to say.

00:21:47,447 --> 00:21:48,749
Try me.

00:21:51,385 --> 00:21:53,387
(sighs)

00:21:56,957 --> 00:21:59,192
I was there,

00:21:59,259 --> 00:22:02,195
but I didn't kill the guy.

00:22:02,262 --> 00:22:04,565
I needed
to make some fast money.

00:22:04,631 --> 00:22:06,133
I broke into those
other two houses.

00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:08,902
I picked them
because it looked like

00:22:08,969 --> 00:22:10,571
nobody was at home.

00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:14,908
<i>The old man's house</i>
<i>was my third stop.</i>

00:22:14,975 --> 00:22:17,644
<i>I went inside,</i>
<i>there's a body on the floor.</i>

00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,513
<i>I got the hell out of there.</i>

00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,415
Why not just call 911?

00:22:21,481 --> 00:22:22,816
(scoffs)

00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,818
Yeah, "Hello, I just
broke into a house,

00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:26,820
"and I found a dead
body on the floor.

00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:30,257
Oh, yeah, yeah, I'll just
wait right here for you."

00:22:30,324 --> 00:22:32,960
Look, I was a reckless punk,

00:22:33,026 --> 00:22:34,628
and I messed up
big-time.

00:22:34,695 --> 00:22:35,929
I broke the law.

00:22:35,996 --> 00:22:38,932
But I did not kill that old man.

00:22:38,999 --> 00:22:40,367
Somebody else did that.

00:22:40,434 --> 00:22:42,169
Why didn't you
mention this

00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:43,270
18 years ago?

00:22:43,337 --> 00:22:45,072
Because my lawyer advised me

00:22:45,138 --> 00:22:47,541
not to admit that I was
at the scene of the crime.

00:22:47,608 --> 00:22:50,010
It was the only honest piece
of advice he ever gave me.

00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:52,846
You know what would give
your story more credibility?

00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,948
If you could ID
the other suspect.

00:22:55,015 --> 00:22:56,850
Lady, if I would've seen him,

00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:58,919
that would've been the
first thing out of my mouth.

00:22:58,986 --> 00:23:00,587
But whoever killed Harrot

00:23:00,654 --> 00:23:02,456
was long gone
by the time I got there.

00:23:02,522 --> 00:23:04,625
We're done here.

00:23:04,691 --> 00:23:06,693
Oh, sure, yeah.

00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,629
Why would you admit
to making a mistake

00:23:08,695 --> 00:23:10,731
that cost me
the last 18 years of my life?

00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:17,137
All I want is my life back.

00:23:17,204 --> 00:23:19,740
Is that asking too much?

00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,728
Hey.

00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:44,131
Jim.

00:23:44,197 --> 00:23:45,198
Thanks for coming by.

00:23:45,265 --> 00:23:47,701
Sure, you bet.

00:23:47,768 --> 00:23:51,038
So, we're all
just passengers
on the time train.

00:23:51,104 --> 00:23:52,372
(chuckles)

00:23:52,439 --> 00:23:54,808
Well, you got that right.

00:24:00,113 --> 00:24:01,181
So, you hit a snag.

00:24:01,248 --> 00:24:03,016
Well, Jeremy Kent now admits

00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:05,719
that he was at the Harrot house.

00:24:05,786 --> 00:24:09,022
And when he got there,
the old man was already dead.

00:24:09,089 --> 00:24:11,725
I call that "perp fiction."

00:24:11,792 --> 00:24:13,961
The problem is, is that
his story is consistent

00:24:14,027 --> 00:24:17,598
with the new evidence
I have yet to disclose.

00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,966
Oh, come on, Catherine,
you know...

00:24:19,032 --> 00:24:20,968
I had this guy pegged
as the bad guy

00:24:21,034 --> 00:24:23,937
the minute I laid eyes on him
18 years ago, and so did you.

00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:26,106
(sighing)

00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:28,475
What if he's telling the truth?

00:24:28,542 --> 00:24:31,144
Wrong place, wrong time.

00:24:31,211 --> 00:24:32,713
Oh, you gotta
tune that out.

00:24:32,779 --> 00:24:34,314
That's all bull.

00:24:34,381 --> 00:24:36,550
All that matters
is what you got on him.

00:24:36,617 --> 00:24:38,919
Now, these guys lie because,
well, because they're good at it

00:24:38,986 --> 00:24:40,687
and because
they're hiding something.

00:24:40,754 --> 00:24:42,122
And the thing they're hiding
is usually

00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:43,490
the thing
that makes them guilty.

00:24:46,393 --> 00:24:49,396
A million years ago,
uh, back when Eddie and I

00:24:49,463 --> 00:24:52,466
first started dating,
we, uh, went to a party

00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:55,769
and, um, you know,
we drank our fair share

00:24:55,836 --> 00:24:58,939
and it was time to leave
and he tosses me the keys

00:24:59,006 --> 00:25:00,407
'cause I'm the responsible one.

00:25:00,474 --> 00:25:02,075
So, you know, I'm driving

00:25:02,142 --> 00:25:04,578
and he starts singing
this stupid song,

00:25:04,645 --> 00:25:07,080
which I've completely
blanked from my memory,

00:25:07,147 --> 00:25:11,218
and one moment I'm just
laughing hysterically

00:25:11,285 --> 00:25:14,955
and the next he has grabbed
the wheel from my hands

00:25:15,022 --> 00:25:18,825
because I almost ran over a man.

00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:23,797
And in that moment, my life
would've changed completely,

00:25:23,864 --> 00:25:27,534
because of a bad decision.

00:25:27,601 --> 00:25:30,437
So...

00:25:30,504 --> 00:25:34,107
What makes me any different
than Jeremy Kent?

00:25:34,174 --> 00:25:36,710
You know, Eddie was right.

00:25:36,777 --> 00:25:38,512
You are the responsible one.

00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:40,614
And if you had
hit that guy,

00:25:40,681 --> 00:25:42,616
you would've called
the cops.

00:25:42,683 --> 00:25:44,218
Because you would've
taken responsibility

00:25:44,284 --> 00:25:46,220
for your actions.

00:25:46,286 --> 00:25:47,721
Now, Jeremy Kent
is a jailhouse lawyer.

00:25:47,788 --> 00:25:48,889
He's a scumbag.

00:25:48,956 --> 00:25:50,958
His freedom, his whole life

00:25:51,024 --> 00:25:54,428
depends upon getting you
to doubt yourself.

00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:58,232
Don't let him live
rent free in your head.

00:26:04,037 --> 00:26:05,405
WILLOWS:
<i>I need your help.</i>

00:26:05,472 --> 00:26:07,007
I want to run
the case.

00:26:07,074 --> 00:26:08,742
The question:

00:26:08,809 --> 00:26:11,478
Does the evidence support
my initial conclusion

00:26:11,545 --> 00:26:13,814
that Jeremy Kent
killed Thomas Harrot?

00:26:13,881 --> 00:26:16,416
I'll start.

00:26:16,483 --> 00:26:19,486
The print on the rock
is even stronger than before.

00:26:19,553 --> 00:26:23,190
The broken window was
the only sign of forced entry,

00:26:23,257 --> 00:26:26,894
and Kent admits to it.

00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:31,531
Unknown shoe impression
at the victim's yard.

00:26:31,598 --> 00:26:32,900
Same size but
never matched

00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:35,836
to any of Jeremy Kent's shoes.

00:26:35,903 --> 00:26:37,504
That makes it equivocal.

00:26:37,571 --> 00:26:40,674
SANDERS:
Archie is still
working on the 911 tape,

00:26:40,741 --> 00:26:42,509
trying to match
the engine noise

00:26:42,576 --> 00:26:43,877
to Kent's car.

00:26:43,944 --> 00:26:46,079
STOKES: Two unknown prints
on the murder weapon.

00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:48,815
Neither one is a match to Kent.

00:26:48,882 --> 00:26:50,784
Sounds like that
would exclude him.

00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:57,024
What if...

00:26:57,090 --> 00:27:01,728
What if... he really
did kill the old man

00:27:01,795 --> 00:27:04,998
and a second suspect tossed
the hammer over the fence?

00:27:05,065 --> 00:27:06,900
An accomplice
would make sense.

00:27:06,967 --> 00:27:09,303
Seven out of ten
breaking and entering cases

00:27:09,369 --> 00:27:12,639
in Las Vegas involve
multiple suspects.

00:27:12,706 --> 00:27:14,274
That would mean that
the second suspect

00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:16,310
probably touched
it last,

00:27:16,376 --> 00:27:19,179
which is why we
only got his prints.

00:27:19,246 --> 00:27:21,782
If there was an accomplice,
why didn't Kent give him up?

00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:24,585
Because sometimes there
is honor among thieves.

00:27:24,651 --> 00:27:26,019
If he knew he
was going down,

00:27:26,086 --> 00:27:28,455
why drag someone else
down with him?

00:27:28,522 --> 00:27:30,257
STOKES:
I don't know about that.

00:27:30,324 --> 00:27:32,993
If any of these guys thought
they could cut a deal,

00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,228
they'd roll over
on their mother.

00:27:34,294 --> 00:27:36,263
I think you're both right.

00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:38,799
People are motivated
by self-interest.

00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:40,434
But there are certain
human bonds

00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,269
that trump
even our base instincts--

00:27:42,336 --> 00:27:46,640
love, blood, fear.

00:27:46,707 --> 00:27:48,942
Right, there's people I love

00:27:49,009 --> 00:27:51,879
but I wouldn't go to prison
for any of them.

00:27:51,945 --> 00:27:53,347
My money's on fear.

00:27:53,413 --> 00:27:56,316
SANDERS:
So, what would Kent
have to be afraid of?

00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:59,853
He wasn't connected
to a gang or organized crime.

00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,989
What about his family?

00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:03,090
He was living on his own.

00:28:03,156 --> 00:28:04,625
His closest relative
was an uncle.

00:28:04,691 --> 00:28:06,468
Sometimes your friends
are your family.

00:28:06,468 --> 00:28:08,203
Did you check
the prison visitor log?

00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:11,240
The DA said that he's never
had any visitors.

00:28:11,307 --> 00:28:13,242
SANDERS:
Kent never made it
to college.

00:28:13,309 --> 00:28:16,045
Most of his friends
were probably from high school.

00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:17,580
Okay, I'll call the high school,

00:28:17,646 --> 00:28:18,914
get his yearbooks, see if any

00:28:18,981 --> 00:28:20,482
of his old teachers
still work there.

00:28:20,549 --> 00:28:24,053
We find the accomplice,
we find the truth.

00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:26,889
Hey, Arch.
Hey.

00:28:26,956 --> 00:28:28,891
Got your text.
Check this out.

00:28:28,958 --> 00:28:30,059
A forensic auto expert

00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,860
sent me over an engine

00:28:31,927 --> 00:28:33,228
signature database.

00:28:33,295 --> 00:28:34,263
So, I compared the noise

00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:36,832
on the 911 tape
to a Pontiac 6000.

00:28:36,899 --> 00:28:38,400
No match.

00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:40,069
That's okay.
We have a new theory

00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:42,771
that Kent had an accomplice.

00:28:42,838 --> 00:28:45,007
Maybe the car on the tape
belongs to him.

00:28:45,074 --> 00:28:46,342
Well, that explains a lot.

00:28:46,408 --> 00:28:48,010
(engine idling)

00:28:48,077 --> 00:28:49,345
Hear that jingling sound?

00:28:49,411 --> 00:28:50,446
Yeah, like, uh,

00:28:50,512 --> 00:28:52,181
keys shaking together.
Mm-hmm.

00:28:52,248 --> 00:28:55,351
That's a heat riser from a
'60s- or '70s-era Dodge engine.

00:28:55,417 --> 00:28:57,620
Now...

00:28:57,686 --> 00:29:02,424
from zero to 27 seconds,
that jingling is constant.

00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:04,593
Tells me the car was idling.

00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,095
Maybe one of them
went into the house

00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,963
while the other one
waited in the car.

00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:12,134
JOHNSON: Look, at 27 seconds,
the engine revs up and down.

00:29:12,201 --> 00:29:13,669
Somebody's hitting the gas.

00:29:13,736 --> 00:29:15,437
At 27 seconds,
Thomas Harrot

00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:17,606
was on the phone
with the 911 operator

00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:20,276
saying someone was
already in his house.

00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:24,280
Listen to this.

00:29:24,346 --> 00:29:27,650
At two minutes and 45
seconds into the tape,

00:29:27,716 --> 00:29:29,818
the Dodge revs and drives away.

00:29:29,885 --> 00:29:31,987
And then 10 seconds
before that...

00:29:32,054 --> 00:29:35,224
(two thuds)

00:29:35,291 --> 00:29:36,225
Wait, slow that down.

00:29:36,292 --> 00:29:38,060
Play it again.

00:29:38,127 --> 00:29:40,729
(two thuds)

00:29:40,796 --> 00:29:42,665
Car doors slamming?

00:29:42,731 --> 00:29:44,466
Two separate doors.

00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:45,968
There was definitely
two of them.

00:29:46,035 --> 00:29:48,771
So, we know at some point
they were both out of the car.

00:29:48,837 --> 00:29:52,474
Question is,
were they both in the house?

00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:54,276
Something about
the hammer prints

00:29:54,343 --> 00:29:55,511
wasn't really sitting
right with me,

00:29:55,577 --> 00:29:57,112
so I reexamined it.

00:29:57,179 --> 00:29:58,814
Now, the full print
on the shaft,

00:29:58,881 --> 00:30:00,683
that's a no-brainer,
that's clearly not Kent's.

00:30:00,749 --> 00:30:03,152
But the partial?

00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:04,753
That's a different story
altogether.

00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:07,222
Check out the, uh,
the top edge here.

00:30:09,692 --> 00:30:12,995
That's not print surface,
that's regular skin.

00:30:13,062 --> 00:30:16,165
I think the suspect was
holding the hammer like this.

00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:21,503
You can see the inside edge of
my pinky is covering the base.

00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:23,138
<i>There could've been</i>
<i>other prints,</i>

00:30:23,205 --> 00:30:24,673
<i>but they weren't in blood</i>

00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:27,977
<i>so they wouldn't have been</i>
<i>preserved over time.</i>

00:30:28,043 --> 00:30:29,612
You only got a ten card on Kent.

00:30:29,678 --> 00:30:32,681
That doesn't include
the inside of his fingers.

00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:34,750
Need to get some major
case prints on this guy.

00:30:34,817 --> 00:30:35,851
That partial could be his.

00:30:35,918 --> 00:30:38,387
Thank you, Nick.

00:30:38,454 --> 00:30:40,456
You're welcome.

00:30:43,225 --> 00:30:45,661
ADAMS:
Let me guess--
you still go through

00:30:45,728 --> 00:30:46,996
your high school
yearbooks?

00:30:47,062 --> 00:30:48,497
Like you don't?

00:30:48,564 --> 00:30:51,734
I can't. I burnt them.

00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,602
It was very cathartic.

00:30:57,906 --> 00:31:00,009
Oh, look, here he is.

00:31:00,075 --> 00:31:03,312
Jeremy Kent
and Sabrina Littee.

00:31:03,379 --> 00:31:07,516
You know, Archie identified
a Dodge from the 911 tape.

00:31:07,583 --> 00:31:09,251
This could be it.

00:31:09,318 --> 00:31:10,452
That's not just
any Dodge.

00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:11,854
That's a '68 Super Bee.

00:31:11,921 --> 00:31:13,722
Classic muscle car.

00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:15,424
We got the license.
Yeah.

00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:23,165
Okay, the car
was registered

00:31:23,232 --> 00:31:25,067
to an Arthur Littee

00:31:25,134 --> 00:31:27,870
from 1988 to 1993.

00:31:27,937 --> 00:31:29,905
Want to bet she's his daughter?

00:31:29,972 --> 00:31:33,042
Maybe Sabrina took Daddy's car
out for a night out on the town.

00:31:33,108 --> 00:31:35,110
I'll call Brass.

00:31:38,914 --> 00:31:40,849
(doorbell rings)

00:31:40,916 --> 00:31:42,585
BRASS:
Oh. Hello, young man.

00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:44,553
I'm a police officer.

00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:46,589
I'm looking for Sabrina Owen.

00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:48,891
Hey, Mom,
somebody's at the door!

00:31:48,958 --> 00:31:51,694
And tell Sam and Katie
to hurry up!

00:31:55,197 --> 00:31:56,665
Hi.
Oh, uh, hi.

00:31:56,732 --> 00:31:59,268
I'm I'm Detective Jim
Brass, Las Vegas Police.

00:31:59,335 --> 00:32:03,305
Are you Sabrina Owen,
used to be Sabrina Littee?

00:32:03,372 --> 00:32:05,207
Yes.

00:32:05,274 --> 00:32:06,375
Can I help you?

00:32:06,442 --> 00:32:07,843
Yeah, I'd like to ask you

00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:09,345
a few questions
about Jeremy Kent.

00:32:12,181 --> 00:32:13,449
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey, guys.

00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:15,751
Uh-uh, slow down.

00:32:15,818 --> 00:32:17,453
You're on the pink team.
Sorry.

00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,255
Yes, yes.

00:32:19,321 --> 00:32:21,991
Jeremy Kent.

00:32:22,057 --> 00:32:24,526
Wow, I haven't...

00:32:24,593 --> 00:32:26,629
I haven't heard that name
in such a long time.

00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:27,896
I'll bet.

00:32:27,963 --> 00:32:30,432
Isn't he, um,
isn't he in prison?

00:32:30,499 --> 00:32:31,667
Well, he's trying to get out.

00:32:31,734 --> 00:32:33,302
He's been granted a new trial.

00:32:33,369 --> 00:32:34,503
I'm just doing
some routine follow up.

00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:36,138
I know the two of you
went to high school together.

00:32:36,205 --> 00:32:37,306
What can you tell me
about him?

00:32:37,373 --> 00:32:40,309
Oh, um...

00:32:40,376 --> 00:32:42,911
I remember he liked to
play up his bad boy rep

00:32:42,978 --> 00:32:44,413
to impress the girls.

00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,714
Did it work?

00:32:45,781 --> 00:32:46,749
Did it work on you?

00:32:46,815 --> 00:32:48,417
Uh, no.

00:32:48,484 --> 00:32:49,919
(laughing):
No.

00:32:49,985 --> 00:32:52,087
I mean, he definitely
tried, so.

00:32:52,154 --> 00:32:53,422
I mean, the truth is,

00:32:53,489 --> 00:32:54,857
I didn't really know
him that well.

00:32:54,924 --> 00:32:57,493
Then how come he was driving
your father's Super Bee

00:32:57,559 --> 00:33:00,596
the night he killed
Thomas Harrot?

00:33:00,663 --> 00:33:02,531
Mom! We're going to be late!

00:33:02,598 --> 00:33:04,600
Just a minute.

00:33:07,369 --> 00:33:09,471
Okay, look...

00:33:09,538 --> 00:33:11,840
Jeremy and I were dating,
but nobody knew.

00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:13,142
We kept it a secret.

00:33:13,208 --> 00:33:14,176
Why?

00:33:14,243 --> 00:33:15,444
Because I wanted
it that way.

00:33:15,511 --> 00:33:19,014
He wasn't my type, and
that was the appeal.

00:33:19,081 --> 00:33:21,050
You know how it is.

00:33:21,116 --> 00:33:22,985
Hmm. What about the car?

00:33:23,052 --> 00:33:26,722
So, yeah, yeah, I-I let Jeremy
use the car sometimes.

00:33:26,789 --> 00:33:29,058
I didn't know how
to say no to him.

00:33:29,124 --> 00:33:30,893
Where were you
the night of the murder?

00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,295
I was at home with my parents

00:33:33,362 --> 00:33:35,331
watching news coverage
of the Rampart fire.
KATIE: Mom!

00:33:35,397 --> 00:33:37,666
(horn honking)
I'm going to need some contact
information on them.

00:33:37,733 --> 00:33:39,001
Mom, we're going to be late!

00:33:39,068 --> 00:33:41,070
Just a minute!

00:33:42,605 --> 00:33:44,540
Mountain View Cemetery,
plot 921.

00:33:44,607 --> 00:33:46,542
Look, I'm sorry.

00:33:46,609 --> 00:33:48,711
Look, my husband's
an attorney.

00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:51,380
So, don't talk to
me, talk to him.

00:33:51,447 --> 00:33:52,414
No, no, I understand.

00:33:52,481 --> 00:33:53,782
I understand.
I totally understand.

00:33:53,849 --> 00:33:55,384
Listen, this is a, uh...

00:33:55,451 --> 00:33:57,419
this is a warrant
for the Super Bee.

00:33:57,486 --> 00:33:58,687
According to the DMV,

00:33:58,754 --> 00:34:00,189
it's currently registered
to you now.

00:34:00,256 --> 00:34:03,225
So, we're going
to take the car.

00:34:03,292 --> 00:34:05,427
Enjoy the game.

00:34:07,751 --> 00:34:09,753
♪ ♪

00:34:40,517 --> 00:34:42,987
♪ ♪

00:34:46,657 --> 00:34:48,225
(whirring)

00:35:01,481 --> 00:35:04,150
We've got something.

00:35:04,485 --> 00:35:05,553
(camera shutter snaps)

00:35:09,657 --> 00:35:11,559
WILLOWS:
That look like blood?

00:35:11,625 --> 00:35:13,694
What are the odds that's window
glass from the house?

00:35:13,761 --> 00:35:14,862
About the same

00:35:14,929 --> 00:35:17,698
as finding a hammer in a tree.

00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:50,131
(high-pitched whirring)

00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:02,476
The elemental composition
of the glass

00:36:02,543 --> 00:36:04,512
that you found in the car
is indistinguishable

00:36:04,578 --> 00:36:07,515
from the exemplars that
you collected 18 years ago.

00:36:07,581 --> 00:36:10,685
Also...

00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:13,054
both had traces of diazinon.

00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,722
Insecticide?

00:36:14,789 --> 00:36:16,390
Yes, indeedy.

00:36:16,457 --> 00:36:18,426
Which was banned in 1999.

00:36:18,492 --> 00:36:20,528
So...

00:36:20,594 --> 00:36:22,463
I'll give you
a money-back guarantee

00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:23,698
that this piece of glass

00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:27,001
was once part of the victim's
living room window.

00:36:27,068 --> 00:36:28,903
Hey, I just got your results.

00:36:28,969 --> 00:36:31,238
She's fast,
but she's thorough.

00:36:31,305 --> 00:36:33,908
Um, the blood on the glass did
not belong to Jeremy Kent.

00:36:33,974 --> 00:36:36,510
It was female, and
it wasn't in CODIS.

00:36:36,577 --> 00:36:38,679
Okay, so, we know

00:36:38,746 --> 00:36:41,349
that Kent and his accomplice

00:36:41,415 --> 00:36:43,884
both entered the house
through the broken window.

00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:45,553
Didn't the getaway car
belong to his girlfriend?

00:36:45,619 --> 00:36:46,754
Yeah.

00:36:46,821 --> 00:36:48,222
(sirens blaring)

00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:49,457
(groans)

00:36:50,524 --> 00:36:53,561
(engine idling)

00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:03,170
BRASS:
<i>We have</i>

00:37:03,237 --> 00:37:05,573
DNA that puts your wife
at the crime scene.

00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:07,608
You were there with Jeremy,
weren't you?

00:37:07,675 --> 00:37:08,709
Don't answer that.

00:37:08,776 --> 00:37:09,877
You better come up
with some answers

00:37:09,944 --> 00:37:10,945
or you're not going anywhere.

00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,582
Jeremy got me pregnant...

00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:15,750
Don't say a word.

00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:17,451
Listen.

00:37:17,518 --> 00:37:19,453
My client was
a 16-year-old kid

00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,955
who got mixed up

00:37:21,022 --> 00:37:22,123
with the wrong guy.

00:37:22,189 --> 00:37:23,724
But she got herself
straightened out.

00:37:23,791 --> 00:37:25,726
We've been married
for 15 years.

00:37:25,793 --> 00:37:26,961
I adopted our
son Tyler.

00:37:27,028 --> 00:37:29,397
There's no conspiracy here.

00:37:29,463 --> 00:37:31,899
And we are here
as a courtesy.

00:37:31,966 --> 00:37:33,134
So, either you
charge her

00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,869
or we walk.

00:37:34,935 --> 00:37:36,737
Who are you-- the lawyer
or the husband? Which one is it?

00:37:36,804 --> 00:37:38,039
(clears throat)
I want to talk.

00:37:38,105 --> 00:37:39,440
Not until we have an agreement.

00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:40,608
No, honey, I want to talk.

00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:43,611
Jeremy got me pregnant.

00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:46,113
I couldn't tell my parents
about the baby.

00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,149
He said we could move to LA,

00:37:48,215 --> 00:37:49,650
start over.

00:37:49,717 --> 00:37:50,918
We didn't have
the money.

00:37:50,985 --> 00:37:52,920
He promised me that he was
going to get the money

00:37:52,987 --> 00:37:54,922
and I was naive, you know.

00:37:54,989 --> 00:37:56,724
I was naive to believe him.

00:37:56,791 --> 00:37:58,092
So you were with him
when he robbed those houses?

00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:01,062
MR. OWEN:
Sabrina, I am advising you

00:38:01,128 --> 00:38:04,498
not to say
anything else.

00:38:06,667 --> 00:38:08,636
I waited in the car.

00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:10,404
You didn't wait in the car
at Thomas Harrot's house.

00:38:10,471 --> 00:38:12,473
I did.

00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:16,010
At first.

00:38:16,077 --> 00:38:18,913
The house was

00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:21,415
supposed to be empty.

00:38:21,482 --> 00:38:23,884
But then,
I heard Jeremy's voice

00:38:23,951 --> 00:38:25,920
and I knew something was wrong.

00:38:25,987 --> 00:38:27,521
So what happened
when you went inside?

00:38:27,588 --> 00:38:31,625
I saw the old man
lying on the floor.

00:38:31,692 --> 00:38:34,695
And Jeremy was standing
over him holding a hammer.

00:38:36,497 --> 00:38:38,466
He was already dead.

00:38:38,532 --> 00:38:40,034
We have your fingerprints
in blood

00:38:40,101 --> 00:38:41,702
on that hammer.
You're lying.

00:38:41,769 --> 00:38:43,504
Get out of my house!

00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:47,141
(thud)
(grunting)

00:38:50,344 --> 00:38:51,579
(Sabrina screams)
(thump)

00:38:59,787 --> 00:39:01,722
I didn't kill him.

00:39:01,789 --> 00:39:03,557
No, no, no. No.

00:39:03,624 --> 00:39:06,961
Jeremy gave me the hammer
to throw away.

00:39:08,529 --> 00:39:10,498
Honey.

00:39:10,564 --> 00:39:13,300
Honey.

00:39:13,367 --> 00:39:15,302
You believe me, don't you?

00:39:15,369 --> 00:39:16,671
Counselor, why don't
you explain

00:39:16,737 --> 00:39:19,273
to your client
the felony murder rule?

00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:20,708
Why don't you explain it to her?

00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:23,511
'Cause I don't know
who you are anymore.

00:39:23,577 --> 00:39:25,579
Baby...

00:39:25,646 --> 00:39:26,914
Honey, don't leave me.

00:39:26,981 --> 00:39:28,916
Honey, please don't leave me.

00:39:28,983 --> 00:39:31,218
Baby, I'm begging you.

00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:33,187
Baby, please don't leave me!

00:39:33,254 --> 00:39:35,256
(door closes)

00:39:35,323 --> 00:39:37,258
(crying):
Oh, God!

00:39:37,325 --> 00:39:38,592
Sit down.

00:39:38,659 --> 00:39:39,627
Relax.

00:39:39,694 --> 00:39:40,695
Sit down.

00:39:40,761 --> 00:39:42,730
(crying):
Oh, my God!

00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:44,398
The felony murder
rule states

00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:46,400
that when a murder
is committed,
(sobbing)

00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:48,069
during the commission
of a felony,

00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:49,737
like a burglary,

00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,739
all the participants
can be charged

00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:54,408
with first-degree
murder...

00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:58,145
regardless of who actually
swings the hammer.

00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:16,897
Let me lay out our case
that we have against you

00:40:16,964 --> 00:40:20,101
and your accomplice.

00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:22,870
Due to the granting
of your new trial,

00:40:22,937 --> 00:40:24,905
the lab reopened
your case.

00:40:24,972 --> 00:40:27,575
We found the murder weapon,

00:40:27,641 --> 00:40:29,643
a claw hammer.

00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,614
And we found
your print

00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:36,617
on the base of the handle
of that hammer.

00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:39,620
And we found your accomplice's
print in blood

00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:41,922
on the body
of that handle.

00:40:41,989 --> 00:40:44,925
We've identified your accomplice
as Sabrina Owen,

00:40:44,992 --> 00:40:47,461
formerly Sabrina Littee...

00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:49,497
your girlfriend

00:40:49,563 --> 00:40:51,499
at the time
of the murder.

00:40:51,565 --> 00:40:53,834
And she's made a full
statement implicating you

00:40:53,901 --> 00:40:55,836
as the killer
of Mr. Thomas Harrot.

00:40:55,903 --> 00:40:58,239
You're freaking lying to me.

00:40:58,305 --> 00:41:00,274
These are copies
of all pertinent documents,

00:41:00,341 --> 00:41:01,776
as well as a transcript

00:41:01,842 --> 00:41:04,245
of Mrs. Owen's
sworn confession.

00:41:11,352 --> 00:41:14,288
"I saw the old man on the floor.

00:41:14,355 --> 00:41:18,125
"Jeremy was standing over him,
holding a hammer.

00:41:18,192 --> 00:41:21,195
He was already dead."

00:41:23,964 --> 00:41:25,900
I can't believe
she would do this to me.

00:41:25,966 --> 00:41:27,201
Yeah,
you protected her

00:41:27,268 --> 00:41:30,538
for 18 years and she sold you
out in five minutes.

00:41:30,604 --> 00:41:32,540
I kept my mouth shut

00:41:32,606 --> 00:41:34,542
so my kid would have a mother.

00:41:34,608 --> 00:41:36,978
Everything I've done
I did for them.

00:41:37,044 --> 00:41:38,813
Why did you ask for a new trial?

00:41:38,879 --> 00:41:41,282
You had to have known that we
might find out about Sabrina.

00:41:41,349 --> 00:41:43,284
No, I didn't.

00:41:43,351 --> 00:41:45,286
Not after all this time.

00:41:45,353 --> 00:41:48,289
Then why?

00:41:48,356 --> 00:41:50,691
'Cause I'm entitled
to a fair trial.

00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,760
But you're still guilty.

00:41:55,096 --> 00:41:56,097
(sighs)

00:41:56,163 --> 00:41:57,832
I just think
it was more than that.

00:41:57,898 --> 00:42:00,501
I mean, you've been in here for
18 years, she's been out there

00:42:00,568 --> 00:42:03,170
with your kid,
living a normal life.

00:42:03,237 --> 00:42:04,505
I think
you just got tired

00:42:04,572 --> 00:42:06,574
of having to pay for the
crime all by yourself.

00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,243
All I think about in here
is that kid

00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:12,246
who has no idea I even exist.

00:42:12,313 --> 00:42:14,248
Sabrina never visited me once.

00:42:14,315 --> 00:42:15,583
She never wrote.

00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:18,419
She never even sent a photo
of my girl or boy.

00:42:18,486 --> 00:42:19,720
I don't even...

00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:21,756
I don't even know a name.

00:42:21,822 --> 00:42:23,391
Your son's name is Tyler.

00:42:28,763 --> 00:42:30,731
Did Sabrina cut a deal?

00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:32,733
No deal.

00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,968
She's been charged.

00:42:34,035 --> 00:42:35,002
She'll stand trial.

00:42:35,069 --> 00:42:37,104
So, she'll testify against me.

00:42:37,171 --> 00:42:38,839
That's up to the DA.

00:42:38,906 --> 00:42:40,875
Well, you tell the DA

00:42:40,941 --> 00:42:42,943
to make sure that happens.

00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:47,448
You're hoping that your son
will be there.

00:42:47,515 --> 00:42:51,018
Might be the only chance
I have in my life to see him.

00:42:51,085 --> 00:42:53,054
That's not right.

00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,690
Maybe not.

00:42:59,327 --> 00:43:01,362
But...

00:43:01,429 --> 00:43:03,397
you had a choice.

00:43:03,464 --> 00:43:06,133
Thomas Harrot didn't.

00:43:08,769 --> 00:43:10,538
my sympathy for him.
