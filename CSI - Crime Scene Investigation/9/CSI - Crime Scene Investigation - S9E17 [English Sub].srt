00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:04,216
(distant sirens wailing)

00:00:20,766 --> 00:00:22,334
(metallic creaking)

00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,922
Drop your weapon.

00:00:55,634 --> 00:00:56,535
(clattering)

00:01:16,922 --> 00:01:18,490
(metallic creaking)

00:01:30,402 --> 00:01:32,204
(loud clattering)

00:01:34,253 --> 00:01:35,387
Drop your gun!

00:01:36,694 --> 00:01:38,162
Drop your gun now.

00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:39,163
(gun clatters on ground)

00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:40,631
You can't win; it's four on one.

00:01:40,698 --> 00:01:42,667
Then I guess it's just about
how many of you I take with me.

00:01:42,734 --> 00:01:45,970
It's okay, Riley.
We got you covered.

00:01:47,672 --> 00:01:48,940
(two gunshots)

00:01:49,007 --> 00:01:50,508
WILLOWS:
You're dead.

00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:53,411
Nice shot, Willows.
(blows)

00:01:53,478 --> 00:01:54,545
WILLOWS:
Thanks.

00:01:54,612 --> 00:01:55,813
And, Adams, you get points

00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,715
for calling Sanders
by your name

00:01:57,782 --> 00:01:59,217
to communicate your intentions.

00:01:59,283 --> 00:02:00,451
That's a good job.

00:02:00,518 --> 00:02:02,153
Hey, how many points
does she lose for missing?

00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,154
ADAMS:
<i>I don't want</i>

00:02:03,221 --> 00:02:04,155
to be defensive or anything,

00:02:04,222 --> 00:02:05,623
but the only reason
I missed was because

00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:07,458
Greg couldn't get
out of the hold.

00:02:07,525 --> 00:02:08,559
(chuckles):
Oh, please.

00:02:08,626 --> 00:02:10,361
Lee knows the signals
better than we do.

00:02:10,428 --> 00:02:13,631
And besides,
you could've been more subtle.

00:02:13,698 --> 00:02:15,633
Play nice, kiddies.
LANGSTON:
I need sidearm clearance

00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,770
and I've got to take a look
at the tactical manual again.

00:02:18,836 --> 00:02:21,205
These codes are very,
very confusing.

00:02:21,272 --> 00:02:23,908
Uh, the most important
signal is Code Four.

00:02:23,975 --> 00:02:26,010
Situation's secure--
Code Four.

00:02:26,077 --> 00:02:27,412
SANDERS:
Second most important:

00:02:27,478 --> 00:02:28,880
four eighty-two.

00:02:28,946 --> 00:02:30,381
I know this.
482 is...

00:02:31,816 --> 00:02:33,418
What is it?

00:02:33,484 --> 00:02:34,852
Lunch.
Okay.

00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:36,154
And Riley's buying.

00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,722
(cell phone ringing)
Nice.

00:02:37,789 --> 00:02:39,223
ADAMS: I'm buying?
Yeah.

00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:40,525
ADAMS:
Well, then I hope you
all like value meals.

00:02:40,591 --> 00:02:43,995
This is Catherine.

00:02:44,062 --> 00:02:45,863
Oh.

00:02:47,432 --> 00:02:48,766
Uh, uh,

00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:50,335
ten minutes out.

00:02:50,401 --> 00:02:52,670
Copy that.

00:02:52,737 --> 00:02:54,238
(snaps phone shut)

00:02:54,305 --> 00:02:56,674
Multiple 419s
at Green Valley and Elm.

00:02:56,741 --> 00:02:57,875
All hands on deck.

00:02:57,942 --> 00:02:59,944
(sirens wailing)

00:03:01,212 --> 00:03:03,214
(helicopter flying overhead)

00:03:07,418 --> 00:03:09,854
LANGSTON:
I looked at a house around
the corner from here

00:03:09,921 --> 00:03:11,989
when I first moved to town.

00:03:12,056 --> 00:03:13,725
I thought this was
a nice neighborhood.

00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:15,026
It is.

00:03:15,093 --> 00:03:17,195
MAN:
I heard this big crash,
so I ran outside,

00:03:17,261 --> 00:03:20,131
and I saw three, maybe four guys
fighting with Reggie Hatcher.

00:03:20,198 --> 00:03:22,033
Bill came out running
with his gun.

00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,634
He tried to stop the fight,

00:03:23,701 --> 00:03:24,902
and they shot him.

00:03:24,969 --> 00:03:26,371
It was like <i>Halo 3;</i>
everybody started shooting.

00:03:26,437 --> 00:03:28,473
Next thing you
know, I go down.

00:03:28,539 --> 00:03:29,807
Okay, here's what we got.

00:03:29,874 --> 00:03:31,642
A call came into 911

00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:35,046
at 11:00 p.m.--
shots fired.

00:03:35,113 --> 00:03:38,416
Neighborhood Watch captain
was shot dead in the street.

00:03:38,483 --> 00:03:41,719
A seven-year-old boy was shot
and killed by a stray bullet

00:03:41,786 --> 00:03:44,989
when he came out
to see what was going on.

00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:51,729
All this happened in front
of the Hatcher house.

00:03:51,796 --> 00:03:52,764
Any suspect info?

00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:53,765
Well, it's early,

00:03:53,831 --> 00:03:55,633
but what we know so far is

00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,102
it could be between two,
three or four suspects,

00:03:58,169 --> 00:04:00,338
black, Hispanic or white.

00:04:00,405 --> 00:04:01,773
They were driving an SUV
that's either black,

00:04:01,839 --> 00:04:03,274
navy blue or dark green.

00:04:03,341 --> 00:04:04,575
Okay?

00:04:04,642 --> 00:04:06,644
I know that doesn't give us
much to work with.

00:04:06,711 --> 00:04:08,880
There's plenty
for us to work with here.

According to witnesses, the
suspects' car was parked here

00:04:46,284 --> 00:04:49,220
in front of this house,
facing the wrong way.

00:04:49,287 --> 00:04:52,290
The suspects then proceeded
on foot to the Hatcher house.

00:04:55,593 --> 00:04:57,595
The owner, Priscilla Hatcher--


00:04:57,662 --> 00:04:59,764
she was transported to the
hospital with a head injury,


00:04:59,831 --> 00:05:01,499
so the interview was limited--


00:05:01,566 --> 00:05:03,401
but she told me
that a group of men--


00:05:03,468 --> 00:05:05,303
uh, she wasn't specific
about how many--


00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:07,705
broke in, they roughed her up,


00:05:07,772 --> 00:05:10,641
they roughed up her son Reggie
and her nephew Frankie.


00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,210
So what do the son
and the nephew have to say?


00:05:12,276 --> 00:05:13,344
Well, they're in the wind.


00:05:13,411 --> 00:05:14,479
We're looking for them.


00:05:14,545 --> 00:05:16,948
So they could've been abducted.


00:05:17,015 --> 00:05:18,383
Something bigger than a bullet
came through this window.


00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:22,120
You've got bloody glass,
blood drops.


00:05:22,186 --> 00:05:23,821
Fight looks like
it came out this way.


00:05:23,888 --> 00:05:24,822
Well, that confirms


00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:26,824
what Priscilla Hatcher said.


00:05:26,891 --> 00:05:28,192
She said that
her son Reggie


00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:30,461
got into a scuffle
with one of the intruders,


00:05:30,528 --> 00:05:31,996
and they came
through the window.


00:05:32,063 --> 00:05:33,131
The Hatchers were the targets,


00:05:33,197 --> 00:05:35,867
yet suspects didn't
park out front.


00:05:35,933 --> 00:05:39,037
Maybe the suspects didn't want
the vehicle to be seen.


00:05:39,103 --> 00:05:42,674
Or didn't know which house
they were going to hit.


00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,208
Why don't you guys
take the house.


00:05:44,275 --> 00:05:46,277
All right.


00:05:48,413 --> 00:05:50,815
BRASS: The Neighborhood
Watch captain.


00:05:50,882 --> 00:05:53,051
His name is
Bill French.


00:05:53,117 --> 00:05:54,385
He's a veteran.


00:05:54,452 --> 00:05:56,554
Survived a tour in
Iraq only to get


00:05:56,621 --> 00:05:58,389
gunned down in front
of his own house.


00:05:58,456 --> 00:05:59,724
It's a shame, really.


00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:01,325
ADAMS:
We have a gun here.


00:06:01,392 --> 00:06:03,761
He got off two rounds.


00:06:03,828 --> 00:06:05,563
.38 caliber.


00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:08,032
WILLOWS:
Nine millimeter.


00:06:09,467 --> 00:06:11,703
Shells all over the place.


00:06:11,769 --> 00:06:13,638
Most of the recent
gang shootings were with nines.


00:06:15,673 --> 00:06:17,508
A blood pool and a blood trail


00:06:17,575 --> 00:06:20,078
away from the body.


00:06:20,144 --> 00:06:21,713
Got to be from
a second source.


00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:25,383
Maybe the Watch commander
shot one of the bad guys.


00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:26,851
You got this, Riley?


00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:28,219
Yeah.


00:06:28,286 --> 00:06:29,654
PHILLIPS:
Sir, I know this is hard.


00:06:29,721 --> 00:06:30,888
I am just doing my job.


00:06:30,955 --> 00:06:32,123
MAN:
No. Just leave us alone.


00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,758
Sir, please...
Listen, you can't take him.


00:06:33,825 --> 00:06:35,593
I'll drive him
to the hospital, okay?


00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,594
I'll drive him.


00:06:36,661 --> 00:06:38,129
PHILLIPS:
Sir, please.


00:06:38,196 --> 00:06:39,597
I need to take him.


00:06:39,664 --> 00:06:41,265
You don't even know his name.


00:06:41,332 --> 00:06:43,101
Okay, but...
Excuse me.


00:06:43,167 --> 00:06:44,268
I'm Greg Sanders.


00:06:44,335 --> 00:06:45,503
I'm with the crime lab.


00:06:47,538 --> 00:06:49,340
What is your son's name?


00:06:53,378 --> 00:06:55,413
Jason Morley.


00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,514
All right,
Mr. Morley.


00:06:57,548 --> 00:07:01,452
Jason's no longer with us.


00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:03,121
He's in a better place.


00:07:03,187 --> 00:07:07,091
There's nothing any of us
can do to change that.


00:07:08,126 --> 00:07:11,729
But you have to let us take him,


00:07:11,796 --> 00:07:13,464
so we can figure out
who did this.


00:07:18,302 --> 00:07:20,171
(sobbing)


00:07:20,238 --> 00:07:21,806
David here will take


00:07:21,873 --> 00:07:23,474
very good care
of your son.


00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:24,709
I promise.


00:07:25,743 --> 00:07:27,779
Sir, please.


00:07:29,847 --> 00:07:31,249
(sniffles)


00:07:31,315 --> 00:07:32,283
(sobbing softly)


00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:34,052
Okay. Okay.


00:07:34,118 --> 00:07:35,787
Okay.


00:07:35,853 --> 00:07:37,855
(sobbing)


00:07:46,698 --> 00:07:49,233
Fresh collision damage.


00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,135
Broken car lights.


00:07:51,202 --> 00:07:52,704
Paint transfer.


00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,505
Got to be from our
suspects' vehicle.


00:07:54,572 --> 00:07:55,807
That's what I'm thinking.


00:07:55,873 --> 00:07:58,109
Suspects' car
is parked


00:07:58,176 --> 00:08:00,178
on the west side of the
cul-de-sac, facing north.


00:08:00,244 --> 00:08:01,179
Right.


00:08:01,245 --> 00:08:03,548
If that blood
does belong


00:08:03,614 --> 00:08:04,549
to one of
the suspects...


00:08:04,615 --> 00:08:05,783
Mm-hmm?


00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:07,885
...I'd say he got
into his car, peels out,


00:08:07,952 --> 00:08:10,388
leaving behind
these yaw marks...


00:08:10,455 --> 00:08:11,989
(tires screech)


00:08:13,891 --> 00:08:15,193
Go, go!


00:08:15,259 --> 00:08:17,762
...sideswipes
the two parked cars?


00:08:17,829 --> 00:08:19,030
Yeah, that's
about it.


00:08:19,097 --> 00:08:20,031
Riley.


00:08:20,098 --> 00:08:21,065
Make sure that
you process


00:08:21,132 --> 00:08:23,901
the collision damage
on the two cars.


00:08:23,968 --> 00:08:25,403
You got it, boss.


00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:26,904
Thank you.


00:08:26,971 --> 00:08:28,973
(camera shutter clicking)


00:08:37,281 --> 00:08:39,217
(men grunting)


00:08:39,283 --> 00:08:40,284
(glass shatters)


00:08:49,727 --> 00:08:51,863
(camera shutter clicking)


00:09:09,981 --> 00:09:13,051
This must be Reggie
and his cousin Frankie.


00:09:14,452 --> 00:09:18,056
Reggie was valedictorian
of his high school class.


00:09:18,122 --> 00:09:20,825
Smart kid.


00:09:20,892 --> 00:09:23,695
Hope he has
some street smarts, too.


00:09:23,761 --> 00:09:26,230
I'll go take a look around
the rest of the house.


00:09:26,297 --> 00:09:28,299
Okay.


00:09:45,216 --> 00:09:46,384
What do we have?

00:09:46,451 --> 00:09:47,552
I got a
pretty good

00:09:47,618 --> 00:09:48,820
handprint off the TV here.

00:09:48,886 --> 00:09:49,821
We have two bedrooms--

00:09:49,887 --> 00:09:52,657
Mom's and Frankie's.

00:09:52,724 --> 00:09:56,227
Found a rolled up sleeping bag
and Reggie's backpack

00:09:56,294 --> 00:09:57,729
on the floor in Frankie's room.

00:09:57,795 --> 00:09:59,997
He's a student at WLVU.

00:10:00,064 --> 00:10:02,400
I don't think
he lives here though.

00:10:02,467 --> 00:10:05,003
Maybe he comes home
to do his laundry.

00:10:09,173 --> 00:10:11,109
According to this...

00:10:13,144 --> 00:10:15,146
...he lives right down
the street.

00:10:24,188 --> 00:10:26,357
(cell phone ringing)

00:10:26,424 --> 00:10:27,525
It's all clear.

00:10:27,592 --> 00:10:28,726
Nobody home.

00:10:28,793 --> 00:10:32,163
This is the house the SUV
was parked in front of.

00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:34,065
Yeah. Brass.

00:10:34,132 --> 00:10:37,035
Okay, I'm going to
want to talk to him.

00:10:37,101 --> 00:10:38,369
I'll be right there.

00:10:38,436 --> 00:10:40,471
So a shooting victim
just rolled in

00:10:40,538 --> 00:10:42,140
to Desert Palm Hospital.

00:10:42,206 --> 00:10:43,675
Could be one
of our suspects.

00:10:43,741 --> 00:10:46,210
I'm gonna go.
Are you okay?
I'm fine.

00:10:50,114 --> 00:10:52,283
When can we
talk to him?

00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,584
Well, he's
in rough shape.

00:10:53,651 --> 00:10:54,919
The docs are
working on him.

00:10:54,986 --> 00:10:56,421
The bullet hit an artery.

00:10:56,487 --> 00:10:58,489
He's lost a lot of blood.
I don't know... Hey, Doc.

00:10:58,556 --> 00:10:59,957
He's dead, I'm afraid.

00:11:00,024 --> 00:11:01,492
We found a
gun on him.

00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:03,861
It's in there
with his clothes

00:11:03,928 --> 00:11:06,130
and a bullet that I pulled
out of his leg.

00:11:06,197 --> 00:11:08,933
Thank you.
Sure.

00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:16,140
Nine millimeter.

00:11:17,508 --> 00:11:18,710
BRASS:
Cuts on his face--

00:11:18,776 --> 00:11:22,013
maybe he went through
the window with Reggie.

00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,948
Snakeback tattoos.

00:11:24,015 --> 00:11:25,249
Guy's a gangbanger.

00:11:26,317 --> 00:11:28,953
(beeping)

00:11:32,957 --> 00:11:35,626
WILLOWS:
Marcus Garfield.

00:11:35,693 --> 00:11:37,729
Five arrests for drugs

00:11:37,795 --> 00:11:39,831
and various armed assaults.
Well, the
Snakeback gang's

00:11:39,897 --> 00:11:42,567
primary source of revenue
is drugs.

00:11:42,633 --> 00:11:44,836
But that street--
it's not in their territory.

00:11:44,902 --> 00:11:46,304
WILLOWS:
Well, Reggie Hatcher

00:11:46,371 --> 00:11:49,507
was a student at WLVU,
which is in their territory.

00:11:49,574 --> 00:11:51,409
Maybe Reggie knew them.

00:11:51,476 --> 00:11:53,511
That would make Reggie
the target, not the house.

00:11:53,578 --> 00:11:57,615
Then Reggie and Frankie
are probably dead.

00:12:02,286 --> 00:12:05,289
(computer beeps)

00:12:08,002 --> 00:12:09,370
WILLOWS:
Let me drive.

00:12:09,436 --> 00:12:11,805
Just give me a second here.

00:12:11,872 --> 00:12:14,708
I'm trying to do Archie a favor,
not get him fired.

00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:16,410
He's at the Academy meeting.

00:12:16,477 --> 00:12:17,911
In Denver.

00:12:17,978 --> 00:12:19,613
Which means he's
snowboarding.

00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,749
There is more
to life than work.

00:12:21,815 --> 00:12:24,151
That's a lesson I learned
from your predecessor.

00:12:24,218 --> 00:12:26,820
(keyboard clacking)

00:12:29,323 --> 00:12:31,191
Where did it go?

00:12:34,995 --> 00:12:36,930
Hmm.

00:12:38,032 --> 00:12:40,501
Camera angle's too high.

00:12:40,567 --> 00:12:42,202
I can't isolate
the driver's face.

00:12:42,269 --> 00:12:44,338
Good. I thought
I missed something.

00:12:44,405 --> 00:12:47,675
With these tinted windows,
you can't tell

00:12:47,741 --> 00:12:49,476
if anyone else
is in the back.

00:12:49,543 --> 00:12:53,180
But I did get you
the license number.

00:12:53,247 --> 00:12:55,716
And, uh, just
for the record,

00:12:55,783 --> 00:12:58,452
Archie may be riding
a half-pipe,

00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:00,688
but it's only
in between lectures.

00:13:00,754 --> 00:13:04,358
Such as, uh, "Breath Analysis
as a Forensics Tool."

00:13:04,425 --> 00:13:06,226
That one's for me.

00:13:06,293 --> 00:13:07,561
It's a part of our deal.

00:13:07,628 --> 00:13:09,330
He got funded and I didn't.

00:13:12,099 --> 00:13:15,903
R.O. is Marcus Garfield.

00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:18,138
So I got you the driver.

00:13:18,205 --> 00:13:20,341
No. He may have driven
to the crime scene,

00:13:20,407 --> 00:13:22,343
but he didn't drive
to the hospital.

00:13:22,409 --> 00:13:24,878
He's the one
that got rolled out.

00:13:24,945 --> 00:13:29,283
Hey, ran the bullets
and the shell casings.

00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,951
All nine mill.

00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:34,655
14 from the dead suspect's gun,
13 from some other nine.

00:13:34,722 --> 00:13:36,090
27 in total.

00:13:36,156 --> 00:13:38,058
So they were packing
high-capacity semiautos.

00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:40,394
Nick and Langston didn't
recover any ammo evidence

00:13:40,461 --> 00:13:42,062
from the Hatcher house.

00:13:42,129 --> 00:13:44,098
If they went there
to kill Reggie,

00:13:44,164 --> 00:13:45,699
they would have
shot him inside.

00:13:45,766 --> 00:13:48,569
If they didn't want to kill him,
what did they want?

00:13:48,636 --> 00:13:52,706
(phone ringing)

00:13:52,773 --> 00:13:54,708
Jim, what's up?

00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,444
Copy that.

00:13:57,511 --> 00:13:59,313
On my way.

00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,614
(snaps phone shut)

00:14:00,681 --> 00:14:04,118
Brass may have just found
both Reggie and Frankie.

00:14:08,856 --> 00:14:10,691
Jim.

00:14:10,758 --> 00:14:12,893
Oh, decomp.

00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,429
BRASS:
The mall security
smelled it, too.

00:14:15,496 --> 00:14:18,632
When she was writing up
the third parking violation.

00:14:18,699 --> 00:14:21,068
The car's registered
to Aaron Sweets.

00:14:21,135 --> 00:14:22,703
He ran with the Snakebacks.

00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:25,873
And according to his record,
he knew Marcus Garfield.

00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,408
James, come on in
and open this up.

00:14:27,474 --> 00:14:28,742
We're only about six
or eight blocks

00:14:28,809 --> 00:14:30,444
from the crime scene.

00:14:36,951 --> 00:14:39,286
Well, that's not Reggie
or Frankie.

00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:45,993
Who's buried in Grant's tomb?

00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,795
Sweets.

00:14:47,861 --> 00:14:49,496
You see the candy cane?

00:14:49,563 --> 00:14:51,131
Aaron Sweets.

00:14:53,467 --> 00:14:56,637
Well, first ticket was written
day before yesterday.

00:14:56,704 --> 00:14:58,205
BRASS:
Well, that means Aaron Sweets

00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:00,608
is not our missing suspect.

00:15:29,003 --> 00:15:31,538
♪ ♪

00:15:38,012 --> 00:15:40,281
That makes four.

00:15:40,347 --> 00:15:41,448
All .22s.

00:15:41,515 --> 00:15:44,518
None of the players
in our mess had .22s.

00:15:44,585 --> 00:15:46,820
TOD?

00:15:46,887 --> 00:15:50,024
Mr. Sweets here
had assumed room temperature.

00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:51,825
Been dead 24 to 48 hours.

00:15:51,892 --> 00:15:53,427
So he was dead
before the shoot-out?

00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,095
Mm-hmm.

00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:57,164
I get gangbangers in here
all the time.

00:15:57,231 --> 00:15:58,999
Might be unrelated.

00:15:59,066 --> 00:16:02,269
Scenes were six blocks apart
in a nice neighborhood.

00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:04,872
<i>This isn't just</i>
<i>a coincidence.</i>

00:16:04,938 --> 00:16:07,908
Marcus Garfield and
an unknown suspect

00:16:07,975 --> 00:16:10,778
gained access to the
Hatcher house there.

00:16:12,613 --> 00:16:14,782
STOKES:
He's not unknown anymore.

00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:17,284
I ID'd the handprint
on the TV--

00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:20,421
Robert Danward,
aka Little Bobby.

00:16:20,487 --> 00:16:21,855
Another member
of the Snakebacks.

00:16:21,922 --> 00:16:24,358
All right. We compared
the blood on the glass

00:16:24,425 --> 00:16:27,695
to the DNA on the toothbrush
found in Reggie's backpack.

00:16:27,761 --> 00:16:30,564
Confirmed that
Marcus Garfield and Reggie

00:16:30,631 --> 00:16:32,066
crashed through the
window together.

00:16:32,132 --> 00:16:33,968
The fight continued
into the street.

00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:36,303
According
to the witnesses,

00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,505
the Neighborhood Watch captain
confronted the suspects.

00:16:38,572 --> 00:16:39,707
The bullet

00:16:39,773 --> 00:16:42,543
pulled from Garfield's leg
matches

00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:44,645
the Watch captain's .38.

00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,280
The bullets they pulled

00:16:46,347 --> 00:16:49,183
from the Watch captain
came from Garfield's nine.

00:16:49,249 --> 00:16:52,419
(both groan)

00:16:53,587 --> 00:16:56,090
(groaning)

00:16:56,156 --> 00:16:58,225
<i>One of Garfield's stray bullets</i>

00:16:58,292 --> 00:17:01,895
hit Jason Morley
who lived here.

00:17:01,962 --> 00:17:04,164
He was the seven-year-old boy.

00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:08,168
Aaron Sweets, another Snakeback,
was shot four times with a .22.

00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:10,537
His body was found in the trunk
of his car in a parking garage

00:17:10,604 --> 00:17:12,673
six blocks from the crime scene.

00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,342
There was no .22 ammo
at the scene.

00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,544
SANDERS:
Can we find any connection

00:17:17,611 --> 00:17:20,614
between Sweets and Reggie?

00:17:20,681 --> 00:17:23,684
Brass checked
with WLVU. Um,

00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,119
Reggie's a straight-A student.

00:17:25,185 --> 00:17:28,122
He was accepted early admissions
for graduate school next fall.

00:17:28,188 --> 00:17:30,858
And I checked Reggie's cell
phone and land line records.

00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:33,527
No calls to or from
our suspects.

00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:34,962
What about Sweets?

00:17:35,029 --> 00:17:36,630
Didn't have his number.

00:17:36,697 --> 00:17:39,933
Try 555-0121.

00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:52,246
Sweets called Reggie's land line
six times

00:17:52,313 --> 00:17:53,647
in the last four days.

00:17:53,714 --> 00:17:55,816
Well, that's our connection.

00:17:55,883 --> 00:17:57,418
Has anyone checked
Reggie's house?

00:17:57,484 --> 00:17:58,619
The uniforms cleared it,

00:17:58,686 --> 00:18:00,587
but they were only looking
for bodies.

00:18:08,495 --> 00:18:09,596
I tore the kitchen apart.

00:18:09,663 --> 00:18:10,698
No drugs, no weapons.

00:18:12,232 --> 00:18:15,069
This doesn't really look
like a college kid's place.

00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:18,572
Reggie inherited this house
from his grandmother.

00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:23,010
Lots of sculpture, paintings.

00:18:23,077 --> 00:18:28,449
Lots of phone jacks in Grandma's
house, but no phones.

00:18:28,515 --> 00:18:31,585
Did you see a phone
in the kitchen?

00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:36,023
No, and none in the master
or guest bedroom either.

00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:38,258
Let's try Reggie's
home phone number.

00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:40,294
Yeah.

00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,465
(dialing tones)

00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,536
(muffled ringing)

00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:04,451
(ringing continues)

00:19:10,057 --> 00:19:12,526
Who puts a phone
in the closet?

00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:22,336
(creaking)

00:19:24,305 --> 00:19:26,206
(ringing continues)

00:19:26,273 --> 00:19:29,543
Wait, wait, wait.
Let me go first.

00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:31,045
When you start
carrying a gun,

00:19:31,111 --> 00:19:33,414
you can lead next time.

00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:41,889
(ringing continues)

00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:04,578
(ringing continues)

00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:17,524
(ringing stops)

00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:18,926
(keypad beeps)

00:20:18,993 --> 00:20:20,260
Odd place for a phone.

00:20:20,327 --> 00:20:21,895
Yeah.

00:20:40,814 --> 00:20:45,753
Piperidine, ether, cyanide.

00:20:45,819 --> 00:20:49,123
Hydrochloric acid,
magnesium turnings.

00:20:49,189 --> 00:20:50,924
This is a PCP lab.

00:20:50,991 --> 00:20:51,959
This is all highly explosive.

00:20:52,026 --> 00:20:53,093
We should get out of here.

00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,361
Yeah.

00:20:57,868 --> 00:21:00,170
<i>Word on the street is</i>
<i>a college kid</i>

00:21:00,237 --> 00:21:02,339
with talent as a mixer
is pushing sherms

00:21:02,406 --> 00:21:04,474
in the Snakeback turf
without paying them tribute.

00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:06,877
Okay, so Reggie's got
a target on his back

00:21:06,944 --> 00:21:08,879
because he's operating under
a different business model?

00:21:08,946 --> 00:21:11,682
You can get a degree,
but it doesn't make you smart.

00:21:11,748 --> 00:21:12,983
Any word on
Little Bobby?

00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:15,285
I heard he's taking
some vacation time.

00:21:17,588 --> 00:21:19,823
What do you want?

00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:22,459
Hey, I just wanted
to let you know

00:21:22,526 --> 00:21:24,461
we got the the guy
who shot Jason.

00:21:24,528 --> 00:21:27,331
He's a known gang member.

00:21:27,397 --> 00:21:30,567
I'd like to rip
his heart out.

00:21:30,634 --> 00:21:34,137
I'd like to let you...

00:21:34,204 --> 00:21:36,940
but he's already dead.

00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:43,514
I know it probably doesn't help.

00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:46,717
You have to do this very often?

00:21:50,554 --> 00:21:52,489
It's not part of my job.

00:21:54,191 --> 00:21:57,027
Thank you.

00:21:57,094 --> 00:21:59,563
I lost my wife last year.

00:22:01,164 --> 00:22:02,366
Jason...

00:22:02,432 --> 00:22:05,469
just started sleeping
in his own bed again.

00:22:09,907 --> 00:22:13,076
Cops like coffee, right?

00:22:13,143 --> 00:22:14,611
You want a cup?

00:22:14,678 --> 00:22:17,381
Sure.

00:22:23,854 --> 00:22:26,823
Send these up to Catherine.

00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:31,528
She says Hazmat wants to know
exactly what's down here.

00:22:34,965 --> 00:22:38,302
Pure white powder.

00:22:38,368 --> 00:22:40,270
Clear crystal
finished product.

00:22:40,337 --> 00:22:44,608
Usually this stuff
looks like yellow sludge.

00:22:44,675 --> 00:22:47,377
Reggie had it going on.
It's high grade.

00:23:03,227 --> 00:23:05,162
(whispers):
Riley.

00:23:11,735 --> 00:23:14,738
(whispers):
Blood. Still wet.

00:23:17,241 --> 00:23:18,375
Stop right there!

00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:23,180
Don't move!

00:23:23,247 --> 00:23:24,515
(groaning)

00:23:38,729 --> 00:23:40,797
Hey, I'm just gonna go check
on my guys.

00:23:40,864 --> 00:23:42,432
If you need anything,
let me know.

00:23:42,499 --> 00:23:43,634
All right.

00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,202
Drop your guns!

00:23:45,269 --> 00:23:46,870
ADAMS:
We're not cops.

00:23:46,937 --> 00:23:48,939
We're lab techs.
We don't carry guns.

00:23:52,543 --> 00:23:53,710
Over there! Sit down!

00:23:55,379 --> 00:23:59,082
Just put the gun down, okay?

00:23:59,149 --> 00:24:01,251
We'll do whatever you want.

00:24:04,221 --> 00:24:05,656
There's a lot of chemicals
in here.

00:24:05,722 --> 00:24:07,724
If you shoot,
you're gonna blow us all up.

00:24:07,791 --> 00:24:09,793
Sit down!
Shut up!

00:24:11,762 --> 00:24:13,697
Go!

00:24:13,764 --> 00:24:15,999
And shut up!

00:24:16,066 --> 00:24:17,334
What happened
to your friend?

00:24:17,401 --> 00:24:19,102
I said shut up!

00:24:19,169 --> 00:24:21,638
SANDERS:
Knock, knock?
Anybody home?

00:24:21,705 --> 00:24:23,440
Who the hell is that? A cop?

00:24:23,507 --> 00:24:27,544
No. He works with us.

00:24:27,611 --> 00:24:29,313
I'm gonna get rid
of him, okay?

00:24:34,818 --> 00:24:37,821
You don't need
any more problems.

00:24:39,056 --> 00:24:41,058
SANDERS:
Hello?

00:24:44,294 --> 00:24:46,430
Hey, guys.

00:24:47,497 --> 00:24:48,765
Get over here.

00:24:52,803 --> 00:24:54,037
Hey, you down there?

00:24:54,104 --> 00:24:55,539
I was in the neighborhood,
thought I'd stop by,

00:24:55,606 --> 00:24:56,907
see if you need any...
It's okay.

00:24:56,974 --> 00:24:58,909
Riley...

00:24:58,976 --> 00:25:00,644
we don't need any help.

00:25:00,711 --> 00:25:03,447
Okay, Sanders.

00:25:05,382 --> 00:25:07,284
See you back at the lab.

00:25:17,394 --> 00:25:19,730
Here, sit, sit!

00:25:31,341 --> 00:25:35,012
We have a situation
downstairs.

00:25:35,078 --> 00:25:36,914
Suspects on
the premises.

00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,682
There's a surveillance camera

00:25:38,749 --> 00:25:40,517
over the front door.

00:25:40,584 --> 00:25:42,152
I'm going to go
call it in.

00:26:04,675 --> 00:26:06,944
BRASS:
Hey, Greg.

00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:09,847
Langston and Riley
have been taken hostage

00:26:09,913 --> 00:26:12,449
at the PCP lab.

00:26:12,516 --> 00:26:15,018
I don't know who or how many.

00:26:15,085 --> 00:26:17,321
I'll call SWAT,
notify Catherine.

00:26:24,228 --> 00:26:27,164
LANGSTON:
You're Reggie, right?

00:26:27,231 --> 00:26:30,133
Hey, man, you listen, okay?

00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,535
I'm not gonna tell you
again, okay?

00:26:31,602 --> 00:26:33,503
Just sit there
and shut up.

00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:35,806
All right, Frankie,
try to calm down.

00:26:35,873 --> 00:26:39,309
How do you know who I am?

00:26:39,376 --> 00:26:41,311
Reggie, your mother's
in the hospital.

00:26:41,378 --> 00:26:42,713
She's worried about you.

00:26:44,014 --> 00:26:45,315
She's worried about
the both of you.

00:26:50,187 --> 00:26:52,122
Reggie looks like he's hurt
pretty bad, Frankie.

00:26:52,189 --> 00:26:53,590
I can help him.
I'm a doctor.

00:26:55,626 --> 00:26:56,860
(gasping)

00:26:56,927 --> 00:26:58,462
I can help him.

00:26:58,529 --> 00:27:00,163
All I need to do is look at him.

00:27:02,199 --> 00:27:03,534
Go.

00:27:05,302 --> 00:27:07,771
No, no, no,
you sit.

00:27:16,413 --> 00:27:18,949
I need more light
to examine him properly.

00:27:19,016 --> 00:27:20,517
Can we bring him into the lab?

00:27:22,085 --> 00:27:23,620
Yeah, okay, okay, okay.

00:27:23,687 --> 00:27:25,989
But this better not be a trick!

00:27:26,056 --> 00:27:27,491
We'll lay you down
on three.

00:27:27,558 --> 00:27:31,328
One, two... three.

00:27:31,395 --> 00:27:32,462
(gasps)

00:27:32,529 --> 00:27:34,097
You hanging in there?

00:27:34,164 --> 00:27:36,833
Is my mom okay?

00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,736
I think she's going
to be fine.

00:27:40,871 --> 00:27:44,174
I didn't mean
for any of this to happen.

00:27:44,241 --> 00:27:46,443
Well,
no one ever does.

00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:49,279
Am I... am I gonna die?

00:27:49,346 --> 00:27:51,148
If you tried to take
this glass out yourself,

00:27:51,215 --> 00:27:52,282
you probably would have.

00:27:52,349 --> 00:27:55,285
You know, I was...

00:27:55,352 --> 00:27:57,788
I was a big fan of Steve Irwin.

00:27:57,855 --> 00:28:00,190
Me, too.

00:28:05,696 --> 00:28:07,030
Hey, come on, man, there's
nothing wrong with his head.

00:28:07,097 --> 00:28:08,966
Get your finger off of there.

00:28:09,032 --> 00:28:12,436
I need to check his vitals;
his heart rate.

00:28:12,502 --> 00:28:15,339
I want to make sure
that he doesn't go into shock.

00:28:15,405 --> 00:28:18,308
Look at me, Reggie.
Open your eyes, look at me.

00:28:18,375 --> 00:28:19,943
(gasping)

00:28:25,115 --> 00:28:26,617
Good.

00:28:29,186 --> 00:28:31,021
Okay.

00:28:31,088 --> 00:28:32,356
(Reggie gasps)

00:28:32,422 --> 00:28:35,292
Frankie, Reggie's
having a reaction

00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:36,793
to the chemicals
in this room.

00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,996
He's been in here too long
and so have you.

00:28:39,062 --> 00:28:40,230
We've to get the both of you
out of here.

00:28:40,297 --> 00:28:41,465
No, no, no, no.

00:28:41,532 --> 00:28:43,233
What do you think
I am, stupid?

00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,135
I think you care
about what happens to Reggie.

00:28:45,202 --> 00:28:47,905
Frankie, let him help me.
Oh, come on, Reg.

00:28:47,971 --> 00:28:50,173
Don't be on their side. What,
are you stuck on stupid, too?

00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,576
Can't you see
they're playing you?!

00:28:52,643 --> 00:28:54,178
You know, that's
your problem.

00:28:54,244 --> 00:28:55,879
You always let
people sucker you.

00:28:55,946 --> 00:28:58,315
My problem was
I tried to help you.

00:28:58,382 --> 00:29:00,217
I should've just let you die
in the streets, man.

00:29:00,284 --> 00:29:05,656
(gunshots)

00:29:07,591 --> 00:29:09,426
FRANKIE:
<i>Mr. Book Smart.</i>

00:29:09,493 --> 00:29:11,295
Man, you ain't that smart.

00:29:11,361 --> 00:29:12,729
You don't know nothing about

00:29:12,796 --> 00:29:13,864
the real grind
like I do.

00:29:13,931 --> 00:29:15,732
The real grind, Frankie?

00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:17,034
Yeah.
The real grind?

00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,368
Yeah.

00:29:18,435 --> 00:29:20,504
The only thing you know
is a gun.

00:29:20,571 --> 00:29:22,940
Without that gun,
you're nothing!

00:29:23,006 --> 00:29:24,441
I'm nothing?!

00:29:24,508 --> 00:29:25,909
Man, without me,

00:29:25,976 --> 00:29:28,245
you wouldn't even have
a dime for grad school!

00:29:28,312 --> 00:29:30,714
I'm the one who turned
your little chemistry projects

00:29:30,781 --> 00:29:32,950
into paper!

00:29:33,016 --> 00:29:35,719
And then you want to go pay
off Sweets like a chump.

00:29:35,786 --> 00:29:37,321
Man, you didn't need to pay
for protection!

00:29:37,387 --> 00:29:38,922
Talking about, you need
protection, this and that!

00:29:38,989 --> 00:29:40,424
You didn't need protection!
You had me!

00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:41,959
I'm the one who
killed Sweets!

00:29:42,025 --> 00:29:44,695
I'm the one who protected
your ass when you needed it!

00:29:44,761 --> 00:29:45,696
That was me! Me!

00:29:45,762 --> 00:29:47,197
Look at me, Frankie!

00:29:47,264 --> 00:29:48,098
What?!

00:29:48,165 --> 00:29:50,734
He's bleeding.

00:29:50,801 --> 00:29:53,437
Sit back, Reggie,
sit back, sit back.

00:29:53,503 --> 00:29:54,805
(groaning)

00:29:58,308 --> 00:30:00,377
All right, Frankie,

00:30:00,444 --> 00:30:02,179
he's gonna die
if I don't help him.

00:30:02,246 --> 00:30:04,114
You've got the gun--
that means you're in charge,

00:30:04,181 --> 00:30:05,382
so you better make a decision.

00:30:05,449 --> 00:30:08,652
Okay.

00:30:08,719 --> 00:30:10,821
Do something,
whatever.

00:30:10,888 --> 00:30:12,923
I need, um, a towel,

00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:14,591
some kind of cloth
to clean up this wound.

00:30:14,658 --> 00:30:16,326
I have to irrigate
the wound.

00:30:16,393 --> 00:30:17,661
I need alcohol or water.

00:30:17,728 --> 00:30:19,496
Do you have any of
that here in the lab?

00:30:19,563 --> 00:30:21,632
We also have to seal up
all those chemicals.

00:30:22,666 --> 00:30:24,401
Yeah, okay.

00:30:24,468 --> 00:30:25,936
Go.

00:30:28,038 --> 00:30:30,474
Um...

00:30:30,541 --> 00:30:31,642
Here...

00:30:31,708 --> 00:30:33,977
Here are paper towels.

00:30:34,044 --> 00:30:36,280
Uh... fresh water
over there.

00:30:36,346 --> 00:30:38,615
(closes door)
We don't have any lids here.

00:30:38,682 --> 00:30:41,885
But I have some tape
in my kit that will work, okay?

00:30:45,556 --> 00:30:47,157
(quietly):
Okay. Go.

00:30:47,224 --> 00:30:49,893
(Reggie groaning)

00:30:53,363 --> 00:30:56,667
(radio squawks)
What the hell are you doing?!

00:30:58,335 --> 00:31:00,837
Frankie!
You calling the cops, huh?!

00:31:00,904 --> 00:31:02,105
Hey...

00:31:02,172 --> 00:31:05,108
Is that what you doing,
Miss Smart-Aleck, huh?!

00:31:05,175 --> 00:31:06,210
Leave it! Drop it!

00:31:06,276 --> 00:31:08,612
Listen to me.
If I don't pick up that radio...

00:31:08,679 --> 00:31:11,181
it's going to send out
a "horizontal alert."

00:31:11,248 --> 00:31:13,283
Now, that means the
police will know

00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:15,185
that we're in trouble
within 30 seconds.

00:31:15,252 --> 00:31:16,520
(gasping)

00:31:16,587 --> 00:31:18,388
So just let me pick it up, okay?

00:31:20,257 --> 00:31:22,326
(mutters):
Turn it off.

00:31:22,392 --> 00:31:23,961
Turn it off!

00:31:24,027 --> 00:31:26,797
T-Turn it off!
Turn it off!

00:31:26,864 --> 00:31:29,600
WILLOWS:
Ray e-mailed me photos
from the PCP lab,

00:31:29,666 --> 00:31:31,969
one of which includes
a surveillance monitor.

00:31:32,035 --> 00:31:34,271
The suspects have a clear view
of the front of the house.

00:31:34,338 --> 00:31:36,139
We got a three-man
entry team right here.

00:31:36,206 --> 00:31:37,474
We'll find an
alternate way in.

00:31:37,541 --> 00:31:39,710
FRANKIE (on radio):
I'm running the show here, okay?

00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:42,045
Hey, we got an open mic.

00:31:42,112 --> 00:31:44,815
LANGSTON:
Look, tell me who's going
to help me here with Reggie.

00:31:44,882 --> 00:31:46,283
I need another pair of hands.

00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:48,218
Reggie and Frankie
are both in there.

00:31:48,285 --> 00:31:49,386
Are you going to help me?

00:31:49,453 --> 00:31:50,921
Sounds like Reggie's injured.

00:31:50,988 --> 00:31:52,923
Which means there's probably
only one gun in there--

00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:54,424
Frankie's.

00:31:54,491 --> 00:31:56,159
FRANKIE:
Get your... get your little
nurse lady to help you.

00:31:56,226 --> 00:31:57,661
That's right, go over there.

00:31:57,728 --> 00:32:00,898
Go help my cousin.

00:32:00,964 --> 00:32:03,767
Frankie, listen to me.

00:32:03,834 --> 00:32:05,035
You haven't hurt anyone yet.

00:32:05,102 --> 00:32:07,838
But if you... if you pull
that trigger, that .22

00:32:07,905 --> 00:32:09,540
is going to change everything.

00:32:09,606 --> 00:32:11,175
Frankie's got the .22.

00:32:11,241 --> 00:32:13,177
Sweets was killed with a .22.

00:32:13,243 --> 00:32:16,113
I haven't hurt anyone yet?

00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,781
Is that what you just said?

00:32:19,616 --> 00:32:23,053
I wasted a guy, okay?

00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,321
I killed a gangbanger.

00:32:24,388 --> 00:32:26,390
(gunshot)

00:32:30,961 --> 00:32:33,096
It's not like the court's
going to execute me.

00:32:33,163 --> 00:32:34,231
I'm only 14!

00:32:34,298 --> 00:32:35,532
So, go ahead!

00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:37,401
Just do something!
Just fix my cousin!

00:32:37,467 --> 00:32:38,735
(helicopter blades whirring)

00:32:38,802 --> 00:32:40,671
What the hell
are they doing here?

00:32:40,737 --> 00:32:43,173
It's a damn news chopper.

00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,775
This is restricted
air space.

00:32:44,842 --> 00:32:46,343
We'll get them
out of here.

00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:48,412
(helicopter blades whirring)

00:32:52,316 --> 00:32:54,952
Cops?

00:32:56,954 --> 00:32:59,656
It was the radio!

00:33:00,691 --> 00:33:01,959
You tricked me,
you bitch!

00:33:02,025 --> 00:33:03,927
(shouting)

00:33:03,994 --> 00:33:06,096
(screaming)

00:33:06,163 --> 00:33:07,231
Frankie, that's enough.

00:33:07,297 --> 00:33:08,465
You!

00:33:08,532 --> 00:33:11,335
(phone ringing)

00:33:18,342 --> 00:33:20,577
(ringing continues)

00:33:20,644 --> 00:33:23,780
(cocks gun)

00:33:23,847 --> 00:33:26,950
If he dies...

00:33:27,017 --> 00:33:29,920
then we all die.

00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:36,094
Frankie, just let me
answer the phone

00:33:36,161 --> 00:33:38,530
and tell them that we're okay.
(phone ringing)

00:33:38,597 --> 00:33:41,533
No. No, no,
they don't need to know squat.

00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,201
Look, Reggie has got
to get to a hospital.

00:33:43,268 --> 00:33:44,870
But you said you could fix him.

00:33:44,936 --> 00:33:46,204
I don't have
the proper equipment.

00:33:46,271 --> 00:33:47,572
He needs a surgeon.

00:33:47,639 --> 00:33:49,407
I'm not a surgeon.
But you're a doctor, right?

00:33:49,474 --> 00:33:50,842
Yes.

00:33:50,909 --> 00:33:52,344
Yeah, so, so, so figure out
something.

00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:54,012
(phone ringing)
Doc...

00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:56,815
(weakly):
I don't feel good.

00:33:56,882 --> 00:33:58,049
Everything is spinning.

00:33:58,116 --> 00:34:01,620
Um, all right, I have, uh...

00:34:01,686 --> 00:34:03,421
Well, I can use the ether
to put you under.

00:34:03,488 --> 00:34:05,757
I've got a scalpel in my
kit to make the incision.

00:34:05,824 --> 00:34:07,259
And hemostats

00:34:07,325 --> 00:34:08,927
to clamp off the veins 
before I remove the glass.

00:34:08,994 --> 00:34:10,896
Um, I still need
other things.

00:34:10,962 --> 00:34:14,533
I-I-I need, uh, gauze,
sterile gauze,

00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:15,767
a needle and thread, antiseptic.

00:34:15,834 --> 00:34:17,235
We don't have any of that stuff.

00:34:17,302 --> 00:34:19,371
Okay, I have all of that.
It's up in the first aid kit.

00:34:19,437 --> 00:34:22,374
But it's in the truck, upstairs.

00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,576
(phone ringing)

00:34:24,643 --> 00:34:27,112
No...!

00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:29,047
No. No one's
going anywhere.

00:34:29,114 --> 00:34:31,049
I can help Reggie,
but I need the kit.

00:34:31,116 --> 00:34:32,117
I have to have it.

00:34:32,184 --> 00:34:33,785
Let me tell them
I'm coming up there.

00:34:35,821 --> 00:34:37,856
(phone ringing)

00:34:37,923 --> 00:34:41,226
This is another... another one
of your tricks, isn't it?

00:34:41,293 --> 00:34:42,761
This isn't a trick, Frankie.

00:34:42,828 --> 00:34:46,598
I want us all to walk
away from this, okay?

00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,268
This is Adams.

00:34:50,335 --> 00:34:52,070
Are you and
Langston okay?

00:34:52,137 --> 00:34:53,972
Yeah, yeah. We're all okay.

00:34:54,039 --> 00:34:55,207
Without alerting the suspects,

00:34:55,273 --> 00:34:58,276
can you describe
the situation in detail?

00:34:58,343 --> 00:35:00,378
We have a kid down here
who is injured.

00:35:00,445 --> 00:35:02,481
He needs medical attention.

00:35:02,547 --> 00:35:05,150
I'm going to come up and get the
first aid kit from the truck.

00:35:05,217 --> 00:35:06,818
Langston is going
to stay here.

00:35:10,655 --> 00:35:13,258
I have to be able
to come back down.

00:35:15,227 --> 00:35:17,462
Okay.

00:35:17,529 --> 00:35:19,731
She's got to go back in,
or Langston's dead.

00:35:19,798 --> 00:35:21,933
Jack, give me a walkie.

00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,568
I want to talk to her.
The front entrance

00:35:23,635 --> 00:35:25,504
and the street are covered
by surveillance.

00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:26,771
They'll be waiting for us
to make our move.

00:35:26,838 --> 00:35:28,673
Okay, I got it.
We got to try.

00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:30,175
I can't just sit here
and do nothing.

00:35:30,242 --> 00:35:33,311
The tree behind the Denali
is the edge of frame.

00:35:33,378 --> 00:35:34,913
Stay behind that.

00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:37,315
BRASS:
Right. Yeah, I got that.

00:35:57,502 --> 00:35:59,638
Why is she going to the back
of the truck?

00:35:59,704 --> 00:36:01,640
We keep the first aid kit in
the back of the truck, Frankie.

00:36:01,706 --> 00:36:03,308
You have to trust us.

00:36:04,342 --> 00:36:06,711
She better not run.

00:36:10,015 --> 00:36:12,083
How you holding up?

00:36:16,021 --> 00:36:18,723
How many guns?

00:36:20,759 --> 00:36:21,760
You armed?

00:36:26,131 --> 00:36:27,999
Then you know
what you got to do.

00:36:28,066 --> 00:36:30,335
LANGSTON:
Frankie, bring me
that bottle of ether, please.

00:36:37,542 --> 00:36:39,544
Yes, that's it.
Put it down there.

00:36:39,611 --> 00:36:41,746
Thank you.

00:36:44,449 --> 00:36:47,018
(wood creaking)

00:36:50,422 --> 00:36:52,557
I came right back.

00:36:56,862 --> 00:36:58,930
Frankie, I'm going
to open this up

00:36:58,997 --> 00:37:03,268
so you can see
for yourself no tricks.

00:37:03,335 --> 00:37:05,337
(Reggie groans)

00:37:07,706 --> 00:37:10,041
Please, please, don't...
don't touch any of that.

00:37:10,108 --> 00:37:12,544
You'll contaminate it,

00:37:12,611 --> 00:37:14,746
and Reggie could get infected.

00:37:14,813 --> 00:37:16,214
Look, I'm going to need
another pair of hands.

00:37:16,281 --> 00:37:18,016
Which one of you is
going to help me?

00:37:18,083 --> 00:37:19,918
Ain't gonna be me.
REGGIE:
Relax, Frankie.

00:37:19,985 --> 00:37:22,754
You just worry about how you're
going to get us out of here.

00:37:26,725 --> 00:37:28,560
Be strong.

00:37:28,627 --> 00:37:31,530
Riley, I want you to
apply pressure here.

00:37:31,596 --> 00:37:34,099
That's good. With your
fingertips, just like that.

00:37:34,166 --> 00:37:35,667
Very good.

00:37:35,734 --> 00:37:40,005
Reggie, I want
you to understand

00:37:40,071 --> 00:37:41,673
exactly what I'm going to do.

00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:43,408
First, I'm going
to put you under.

00:37:43,475 --> 00:37:44,776
Once you're under,

00:37:44,843 --> 00:37:47,546
I'm going to stop the bleeding,
and once that's done,

00:37:47,612 --> 00:37:51,449
I'm going to try and remove
the glass. All right?

00:37:51,516 --> 00:37:54,352
Listen, tell my mom I love her.

00:37:54,419 --> 00:37:56,421
You tell her that yourself.

00:37:58,456 --> 00:38:01,593
You know, I only wanted
to become a real scientist.

00:38:03,628 --> 00:38:05,597
Maybe do some good.

00:38:06,932 --> 00:38:09,534
I guess I thought
I could handle everything.

00:38:09,601 --> 00:38:12,904
Things got away from me.

00:38:16,041 --> 00:38:17,809
Try and relax.

00:38:17,876 --> 00:38:20,779
I shouldn't have run.

00:38:20,846 --> 00:38:23,181
Don't fight it.

00:38:23,248 --> 00:38:24,749
Just relax.

00:38:24,816 --> 00:38:26,651
Take a couple of
deep breaths.

00:38:26,718 --> 00:38:28,720
(Reggie breathing deeply)

00:38:49,341 --> 00:38:51,643
I have to cut
him, Frankie.

00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:52,844
It's very difficult

00:38:52,911 --> 00:38:55,380
to concentrate with you
pointing that gun at me.

00:38:59,484 --> 00:39:01,319
We can pump in CS gas.

00:39:01,386 --> 00:39:03,088
On the west end of the house,
there's a vent

00:39:03,155 --> 00:39:04,723
that leads directly
into the lab.

00:39:04,789 --> 00:39:06,691
Except we're talking about a
14-year-old kid with a gun

00:39:06,758 --> 00:39:07,893
that he's not
afraid to use.

00:39:07,959 --> 00:39:09,161
The gas could
cause him to panic.

00:39:09,227 --> 00:39:10,996
Yeah, one wild shot
and he blows up the whole block.

00:39:11,062 --> 00:39:12,164
STOKES:
Riley's armed.

00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:13,765
She's trained for this.

00:39:13,832 --> 00:39:16,034
If she gets the opportunity,
she will take it.

00:39:16,101 --> 00:39:18,503
One thing we got going for us,
time is on our side.

00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:20,772
I say we trust them.

00:39:20,839 --> 00:39:22,974
So do I.

00:39:28,947 --> 00:39:30,749
We need more towels.

00:39:36,855 --> 00:39:39,324
Hand me another hemostat.

00:39:47,332 --> 00:39:48,533
Okay.

00:39:56,775 --> 00:39:59,110
All right. Ready?
Yeah.

00:40:00,145 --> 00:40:01,346
And... here we go.

00:40:01,413 --> 00:40:02,781
Okay.

00:40:06,418 --> 00:40:08,854
Oh, my God!
What did you do to him?

00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,356
I need help.
He's not going to die, is he?

00:40:11,423 --> 00:40:14,893
I need someone
to put pressure on the artery.

00:40:16,428 --> 00:40:18,263
Give me the gun.

00:40:20,432 --> 00:40:22,667
I need someone to
apply pressure

00:40:22,734 --> 00:40:24,870
to the artery while I make
a pressure bandage, Frankie.

00:40:24,936 --> 00:40:26,037
I need your hands.

00:40:26,104 --> 00:40:28,940
ADAMS:
Reggie needs your help.

00:40:29,007 --> 00:40:30,609
Give me the gun.

00:40:30,675 --> 00:40:32,978
Come on, do some good
for a change.

00:40:35,514 --> 00:40:37,516
Frankie, I need you
over here <i>now.</i>

00:40:49,194 --> 00:40:51,062
LANGSTON:
You see where my hand is?

00:40:51,129 --> 00:40:52,397
Put your hand there.
You feel it?

00:40:52,464 --> 00:40:54,099
You got it?
That's it, right there.

00:40:54,166 --> 00:40:55,734
Keep the pressure tight.
Good.

00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:59,204
Code Four, suspect's disarmed.

00:40:59,271 --> 00:41:01,673
We need an ambulance,
Code Three.

00:41:22,527 --> 00:41:24,763
Have your people treat
him fairly, Captain.

00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:26,998
He doesn't have to
be a lost cause.

00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:31,002
Somehow, I knew
you were going to say that.

00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,309
(indistinct radio transmissions)
