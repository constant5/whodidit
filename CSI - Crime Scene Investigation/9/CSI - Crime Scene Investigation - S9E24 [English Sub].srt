WOMAN:
What happened?

00:02:16,356 --> 00:02:17,591
Guy was working
a landscape gig.

00:02:17,658 --> 00:02:19,359
They were trying
to move a giant saguaro

00:02:19,426 --> 00:02:20,661
without using
the right gear.
(groans)

00:02:20,728 --> 00:02:22,796
Fell over on him.

00:02:22,863 --> 00:02:23,997
Any chance he's
got insurance?

00:02:24,064 --> 00:02:25,833
About the same chance
he's a legal immigrant.

00:02:25,899 --> 00:02:27,601

No!

00:02:27,668 --> 00:02:30,604

Whoa, whoa, whoa, e-easy.

00:02:32,106 --> 00:02:33,874

right now, my friend.

Start oxygen, give him
two milligrams of morphine

00:02:45,786 --> 00:02:46,820

for surgery.

00:02:46,887 --> 00:02:49,523

00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:53,660
Got to go.

00:02:53,727 --> 00:02:54,762

WILLOWS:

You'll have it on your desk
by the end of shift.

00:03:02,603 --> 00:03:05,606
Yes, I've included
a 10% cut across the board.

00:03:05,672 --> 00:03:08,609
Just make sure there's 10% less
crime, and we'll be fine.

00:03:08,675 --> 00:03:10,611
(indistinct radio chatter)

00:03:10,677 --> 00:03:11,845
What do we
have here?

00:03:11,912 --> 00:03:13,981
Business as usual.

00:03:14,047 --> 00:03:15,883
Trucker spotted the body
this morning.

00:03:15,949 --> 00:03:19,119

TOD was sometime last night.

00:03:19,186 --> 00:03:22,056
A single GSW
to the back of the head.

00:03:22,122 --> 00:03:23,690
Looks like a good-sized wound,

00:03:23,757 --> 00:03:24,792
I'd say medium caliber.

00:03:27,061 --> 00:03:29,430
Sooting and stippling
make it a close shot.

00:03:29,496 --> 00:03:31,799
Execution,
body dump?

00:03:31,865 --> 00:03:33,233
That'd be my guess.

00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:37,404
Looks like the car
skidded to a halt here.

00:03:37,471 --> 00:03:39,173
Killer dumped the body

00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:42,042
and then accelerated
back up onto the road.

00:03:42,109 --> 00:03:43,043
The body is

00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,345
well forward
of the rear tire divots,

00:03:45,412 --> 00:03:47,681
about where
the driver's door would be.

00:03:47,748 --> 00:03:50,417
Which means the victim
was probably behind the wheel.

00:03:50,484 --> 00:03:52,219
(gunshot, tires screech)

00:04:02,096 --> 00:04:03,630
Maybe he picked up
the wrong hitchhiker.

00:04:04,665 --> 00:04:06,633
Okay, ready to roll.

00:04:16,143 --> 00:04:17,978
WILLOWS:
That's a lot of slogans.

00:04:18,045 --> 00:04:19,880
Guess he liked advertising.

00:04:19,947 --> 00:04:24,852
Wonder how he felt

Yeah, he seems to be
covered with it.


00:05:21,075 --> 00:05:22,743
It's even up his nose.

His hands are

Let's put him
in the system.


00:05:42,029 --> 00:05:46,100
So we have
two distinct sets

leading away from the vehicle,


00:05:48,268 --> 00:05:51,004
neither of which
belong to the victim.


00:05:51,071 --> 00:05:52,906
So that means at least
three people in the car.


00:05:54,575 --> 00:05:55,709
These look
like sneakers.

00:11:17,898 --> 00:11:19,767
He's just one of those
part-time guys. He...

00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:22,836
He wasn't so part-time
back in high school, Barbie.

00:11:22,903 --> 00:11:24,705
You two tore it up

00:11:24,772 --> 00:11:25,973
pretty good,
as I remember.

00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:28,642
That was a long
time ago, Clem.

00:11:28,709 --> 00:11:32,279
You don't think Bruno's tied up
in any of this, do you?

00:11:32,346 --> 00:11:33,781
How can I find him?

00:11:33,847 --> 00:11:34,815
I don't know.

00:11:34,882 --> 00:11:36,283
He took a couple days off.

00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:38,685
Said something about
going up north

00:11:38,752 --> 00:11:40,454
looking for work.

00:11:40,521 --> 00:11:43,157
Unskilled labor, no doubt.
(raspy laugh)

00:11:44,892 --> 00:11:46,860
I thought he worked here.
Well, he does,

00:11:46,927 --> 00:11:50,397
but these days, sir, it just
ain't enough to live on.

00:11:52,633 --> 00:11:55,035
ADAMS:
<i>According to the deputy</i>

00:11:55,102 --> 00:11:57,337

00:11:57,404 --> 00:11:58,806
(thunder crashing)

00:11:58,872 --> 00:12:01,208
<i>...if it hadn't been</i>
<i>for the weather.</i>

00:12:06,547 --> 00:12:08,982
<i>So unlike Huston Dobbs,</i>

00:12:09,049 --> 00:12:10,617
we seem to have caught a break.

00:12:11,885 --> 00:12:13,087
Toothbrush.

00:12:15,456 --> 00:12:17,691
Razor.

00:12:17,758 --> 00:12:20,761
(sloshing)

00:12:22,262 --> 00:12:23,497
Lavatory.

00:12:23,564 --> 00:12:25,432
Guy must have been
living in his car.

00:12:25,499 --> 00:12:27,000
HODGES:
It is a Chrysler LeBaron.

00:12:27,067 --> 00:12:29,436
A babe magnet.

00:12:30,604 --> 00:12:31,939
You should make an offer.

00:12:33,173 --> 00:12:35,042
Um, I think it's safe to say

00:12:35,109 --> 00:12:37,544
that the victim did not drive
this thing back to town.

00:12:37,611 --> 00:12:39,046
Agreed.

00:12:40,481 --> 00:12:42,316
Thank you.

00:12:47,388 --> 00:12:48,789
Oh, hey...

00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:53,660
This looks like
a piece of skull.

00:12:53,727 --> 00:12:56,096
We know the last thing
that went through his mind

00:12:56,163 --> 00:12:57,731
was a copper-jacketed .38.

00:12:57,798 --> 00:13:00,634
HODGES:
These keys are pretty charred.

00:13:00,701 --> 00:13:03,003
I doubt Mandy's going to
get any prints off them.

00:13:04,671 --> 00:13:06,306
(chuckles)

00:13:06,373 --> 00:13:07,674
It's an old Hux Club
casino chip.

00:13:07,741 --> 00:13:11,612
Hampton Huxley, the dead
porno mag guy?

00:13:11,678 --> 00:13:14,081
It's not porno,
it's a lifestyle.

00:13:14,148 --> 00:13:15,682
For one brief,
shining moment

00:13:15,749 --> 00:13:17,351
in the 80's,

00:13:17,418 --> 00:13:20,020
scantily clad Hux Club Kittens
serving cocktails

00:13:20,087 --> 00:13:22,089
and dealing blackjack

00:13:22,156 --> 00:13:24,825
was the pinnacle of
Las Vegas high society.

00:13:24,892 --> 00:13:26,593
How'd you get in?

00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:29,596
Sadly, only through the
glossy pages of the magazine.
Hmm.

00:13:29,663 --> 00:13:32,466
Which I purchased
for the articles.
Okay.

00:13:34,068 --> 00:13:36,203
Wendy, I got blood
on the backseat.

00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:37,504
Okay.

00:13:41,508 --> 00:13:44,011
Along with something else.

00:13:48,048 --> 00:13:50,684
.22 L-R.

00:13:50,751 --> 00:13:52,352
A peashooter round.

00:13:52,419 --> 00:13:54,121
So there are actually
two guns involved.

00:13:54,188 --> 00:13:55,122
Yeah.

00:13:55,189 --> 00:13:56,890
And I've got one of them.

00:13:56,957 --> 00:13:58,826
Hodges.

00:13:58,892 --> 00:13:59,960
Relax.

00:14:00,027 --> 00:14:01,528
It's just a belt buckle.

00:14:01,595 --> 00:14:02,730
For people who love guns.

00:14:02,796 --> 00:14:04,331
I love guns.

00:14:15,008 --> 00:14:18,245
ADAMS:
There's a print here
etched into the metal.

00:14:18,312 --> 00:14:21,615
<i>Salts and amino acids</i>
<i>from fingerprint oil</i>

00:14:21,682 --> 00:14:25,119
<i>can chemically etch</i>
<i>metal over time.</i>

00:14:25,185 --> 00:14:27,888
<i>Heat greatly accelerates</i>
<i>the process.</i>

00:14:27,955 --> 00:14:31,258
You sometimes see it
in arson investigations.

00:14:32,826 --> 00:14:35,496
The print belongs
to Wiley Schindler.

00:14:35,562 --> 00:14:37,364
He's in the system off
a work card.

00:14:37,431 --> 00:14:39,533
This buckle looks so familiar.

00:14:41,802 --> 00:14:43,504
Is this a Vanderfield
Arms mini .22?

00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:44,872
Why, yes, it is.

00:14:44,938 --> 00:14:48,409
WILLOWS:
It's a concealable revolver.

00:14:48,475 --> 00:14:50,511
Perfect for the man
who trusts no one.

00:14:50,577 --> 00:14:52,012
My dad had one.

00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,448
Schindler's address
is listed as Kansas City.

00:14:54,515 --> 00:14:56,784
He's a collectables
dealer.

00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:58,252
I Googled him.

00:14:58,318 --> 00:15:00,721
SCHINDLER: I'll be hightailing
it to Las Vegas

00:15:00,788 --> 00:15:02,356
from May 11 to the 18th

00:15:02,423 --> 00:15:03,891
for the World Collectables
Trade Fair

00:15:03,957 --> 00:15:05,225
at The Green Valley Ranch.

00:15:05,292 --> 00:15:08,462
If you want to sit down
to talk turkey, give me a call.

00:15:08,529 --> 00:15:10,030
What do you know,
he's in town.

00:15:10,097 --> 00:15:12,566
I'm ready to talk turkey.

00:15:12,633 --> 00:15:13,600
(brassy swing tune blasts)

00:15:13,667 --> 00:15:14,802
♪ Night and day... ♪

00:15:14,868 --> 00:15:15,936
SCHINDLER:
<i>Yes, sir, those are</i>

00:15:16,003 --> 00:15:17,638
the original
crystal doorknobs

00:15:17,704 --> 00:15:21,308
handpicked
by Bugsy Siegel himself

00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:23,777
for the bathroom suite that
he personally customized

00:15:23,844 --> 00:15:26,713
for Lana Turner at the
Flamingo, back in 1945.

00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,215
Now think about it--

00:15:28,282 --> 00:15:31,185
Lana had to be naked
as a jaybird

00:15:31,251 --> 00:15:32,586
when she fondled those knobs.

00:15:32,653 --> 00:15:35,422
You have
exquisite taste.

00:15:35,489 --> 00:15:38,225
I'm prepared to let you
have the entire set for--

00:15:38,292 --> 00:15:40,060
oh, let me see, uh...

00:15:40,127 --> 00:15:41,995
Oh, thank you, darling.

00:15:42,062 --> 00:15:43,897
Wiley Schindler?

00:15:43,964 --> 00:15:45,833
That I am. Just give us
a moment, friend.

00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:46,967
Doing a little
business here.

00:15:47,034 --> 00:15:48,569
So are we. We need to talk.

00:15:48,635 --> 00:15:50,237
Nice boots.

00:15:50,304 --> 00:15:51,839
Thank you. I just got 'em.

00:15:51,905 --> 00:15:53,307
You looking for a pair?
Excuse me.

00:15:54,908 --> 00:15:56,310
(sighs)

00:15:57,377 --> 00:15:59,613
You know these
two guys?

00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,648
Can't say I know
'em well.

00:16:01,715 --> 00:16:02,883
Just met 'em
the other day.

00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:03,951
Where and how?

00:16:04,017 --> 00:16:06,420
A little greasy spoon
in Elba.

00:16:06,487 --> 00:16:11,225
<i>I just pulled in</i>
<i>to get some grub.</i>

00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:14,995
<i>And much to my surprise, I saw</i>
<i>something there I liked.</i>

00:16:17,865 --> 00:16:19,800
I told her I admired
her earrings

00:16:19,867 --> 00:16:21,268
and asked her if there was

00:16:21,335 --> 00:16:22,636
any more where
those came from.

00:16:22,703 --> 00:16:24,938
She said she'd make a call.

00:16:25,005 --> 00:16:27,608
So there's 200 chips in here.

00:16:27,674 --> 00:16:29,877
300 bucks, you can have
the whole kit and caboodle.

00:16:29,943 --> 00:16:31,612
We ain't taking
a penny less.

00:16:31,678 --> 00:16:34,114
I don't know, fellas.
That's a lot of money.

00:16:34,181 --> 00:16:36,383
<i>See, you got to make</i>
<i>the other fella</i>

00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:38,385
<i>think he's getting over on you.</i>

00:16:38,452 --> 00:16:41,355
My wife and I got married
at the Hux and, now...

00:16:41,422 --> 00:16:43,824
You do not want to go
cheap on your wife.

00:16:43,891 --> 00:16:45,793
Loretta's gone.

00:16:45,859 --> 00:16:47,394
The chips are just for me.

00:16:47,461 --> 00:16:50,464
<i>See, I knew we were going to</i>
<i>settle on a dollar a chip</i>

00:16:50,531 --> 00:16:52,232
<i>the minute they opened</i>
<i>their mouths.</i>

00:16:52,299 --> 00:16:53,700
200.

00:16:53,767 --> 00:16:55,536
That's a buck apiece.
You got a deal.

00:16:55,602 --> 00:16:57,838
<i>Let 'em see your pain.</i>

00:16:57,905 --> 00:16:59,339
<i>Make 'em feel good,</i>
<i>and then...</i>

00:16:59,406 --> 00:17:02,042
Okay, deal.

00:17:02,109 --> 00:17:04,144
There's few things in life

00:17:04,211 --> 00:17:05,946
that'll make
an old man's nipples hard,

00:17:06,013 --> 00:17:07,681
and that qualifies.

00:17:07,748 --> 00:17:09,850
You tell 'em you're
a collectables dealer?

00:17:09,917 --> 00:17:11,318
It never came up.

00:17:11,385 --> 00:17:13,020
That's the last time I saw
either one of them.

00:17:13,087 --> 00:17:14,121
Just out of curiosity,

00:17:14,188 --> 00:17:15,322
what would you say
the chips are worth?

00:17:15,389 --> 00:17:17,991
Whatever the market will bear.

00:17:18,058 --> 00:17:20,427
Well, it is pretty much
a bear market these days.

00:17:20,494 --> 00:17:22,596
So this guy's dead...

00:17:22,663 --> 00:17:25,265
and this guy's turning out
to be pretty hard to find.

00:17:25,332 --> 00:17:26,834
Maybe this guy killed that one

00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,969
and then took a powder.

00:17:29,036 --> 00:17:32,272
Or maybe you killed this guy
and chased this guy away.

00:17:32,339 --> 00:17:34,908
You can't be serious.

00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:36,910
We did find
the belt buckle

00:17:36,977 --> 00:17:38,946
of your concealed .22
at the scene.

00:17:39,012 --> 00:17:42,082
Well, they admired it-- big,
handsome thing that it is.

00:17:42,149 --> 00:17:44,351
So I gave it to 'em
to seal the deal.

00:17:44,418 --> 00:17:46,186
Well, I'm making you
a new deal.

00:17:46,253 --> 00:17:48,322
You're under arrest.

00:17:58,675 --> 00:18:01,011
SANDERS:
<i>When the Hux Club opened</i>
<i>in 1981,</i>

00:18:01,077 --> 00:18:04,547
<i>it was as if the great men's</i>
<i>magazine had come to life.</i>

00:18:04,614 --> 00:18:06,950
<i>But like all gardens</i>
<i>in paradise,</i>

00:18:07,017 --> 00:18:09,285
<i>it couldn't last long</i>
<i>here on Earth.</i>

00:18:09,352 --> 00:18:11,087
<i>Hux had a falling out</i>
<i>with his partners</i>

00:18:11,154 --> 00:18:12,522
<i>and pulled out of the venture,</i>

00:18:12,589 --> 00:18:15,325
<i>taking all his trademarks</i>
<i>with him.</i>

00:18:15,392 --> 00:18:16,860
They remodeled the casino,

00:18:16,926 --> 00:18:20,697
but without Hux and his Kittens
to bring the bang, so to speak,

00:18:20,764 --> 00:18:23,033
the New Babylon,
as they renamed it,

00:18:23,099 --> 00:18:24,467
died a quick

00:18:24,534 --> 00:18:26,770
and painful death.

00:18:26,836 --> 00:18:30,407
Now according to the gaming
commission records,

00:18:30,473 --> 00:18:33,209
all of the chips from the
Hux Club were destroyed.

00:18:33,276 --> 00:18:35,178
Well, it's the law
when you close a casino.

00:18:35,245 --> 00:18:37,647
When Sam imploded the Rampart,
he buried all the old chips

00:18:37,714 --> 00:18:39,182
in the foundation
of the Eclipse.

00:18:39,249 --> 00:18:41,584
Which is precisely why
surviving chips

00:18:41,651 --> 00:18:42,819
become collectables.

00:18:42,886 --> 00:18:44,521
You throw in
a Hampton Huxley aura

00:18:44,587 --> 00:18:47,490
and you have got an item
that auctions

00:18:47,557 --> 00:18:50,593
for up to $10,000
in mint condition.

00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:53,196
Apparently there's less than
a dozen of these in existence.

00:18:53,263 --> 00:18:55,198
Until today.

00:18:56,733 --> 00:19:01,838
We recovered these from
Wiley Schindler's hotel room.

00:19:01,905 --> 00:19:05,542
172 chips--

00:19:05,608 --> 00:19:06,943
and $50,000 in cash.

00:19:09,612 --> 00:19:11,514
So I spoke to some people
at the trade show.

00:19:11,581 --> 00:19:13,450
Said that you sold more
than a few Hux chips

00:19:13,516 --> 00:19:14,851
to a bunch of different
collectors.

00:19:14,918 --> 00:19:17,821
I wasn't aware you could put
a man in jail for that.

00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,556
You're in jail 'cause I think
you're a killer.

00:19:19,622 --> 00:19:20,724
Which I'm not.

00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:22,525
Let's agree
to disagree, okay?

00:19:22,592 --> 00:19:24,160
You know, for about 30 years,

00:19:24,227 --> 00:19:26,696
some people who care
about these things

00:19:26,763 --> 00:19:29,032
had to be consoled because
there were so few

00:19:29,099 --> 00:19:33,937
of these casino chips from
the famed Hux Club in existence.

00:19:34,004 --> 00:19:35,839
And then you show up with
a couple hundred of them.

00:19:35,905 --> 00:19:37,207
I told you how I got those.

00:19:37,273 --> 00:19:38,608
Here's what I think happened.

00:19:38,675 --> 00:19:40,877
I think you
and Bruno and Huston

00:19:40,944 --> 00:19:44,447
cooked up a scheme to
put some counterfeit
chips in circulation.

00:19:44,514 --> 00:19:47,183
I never sold anything to anybody
that wasn't what I said it was.

00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,618
So you end up
in the car

00:19:48,685 --> 00:19:50,120
going out to the desert.

00:19:50,186 --> 00:19:51,588
Somebody says something,
somebody doesn't say something.

00:19:51,655 --> 00:19:53,156
Things get weird.

00:19:53,223 --> 00:19:56,126
And a guy gets a bullet hole
in his head.

00:19:58,094 --> 00:19:59,629
That ring a bell?

00:19:59,696 --> 00:20:01,731
Not even a tinkle.

00:20:01,798 --> 00:20:03,400
Do you see a lawyer

00:20:03,466 --> 00:20:05,135
in here with me?

00:20:05,201 --> 00:20:09,239
That's because I'm trying
to talk to you man to man.

00:20:09,306 --> 00:20:10,940
I didn't kill anybody.

00:20:11,007 --> 00:20:12,075
I didn't cheat anybody.

00:20:12,142 --> 00:20:13,576
And the sooner you figure
that out

00:20:13,643 --> 00:20:16,146
the sooner you can stop
wasting both our time.

00:20:46,609 --> 00:20:50,480
HODGES: <i>Micro-FTIR confirms that</i>
<i>they are compression-molded</i>

00:20:50,547 --> 00:20:53,984
<i>clay with impressed stainless</i>
<i>steel inlays,</i>

00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:56,920
<i>consistent with the specs</i>
<i>from the gaming commission.</i>

00:20:56,987 --> 00:21:00,290
They're authentic
Hux Club chips...

00:21:00,357 --> 00:21:01,791
Sorry.

00:21:01,858 --> 00:21:03,560
They were manufactured
with state-of-the-art

00:21:03,626 --> 00:21:05,562
anti-counterfeiting
technology from 1981.

00:21:05,628 --> 00:21:08,131
So Bruno and Huston
must've found these

00:21:08,198 --> 00:21:09,699
tucked away in the attic

00:21:09,766 --> 00:21:12,769
or daddy's old trunk.

00:21:12,836 --> 00:21:15,205
You never know what people
keep for sentimental reasons.

00:21:15,271 --> 00:21:18,174
ADAMS: Yeah, but
why keep that many?

00:21:18,241 --> 00:21:20,477
Even at face value,
they were worth thousands.

00:21:20,543 --> 00:21:22,112
WILLOWS:
In any case,

00:21:22,178 --> 00:21:24,381
if Schindler got
authentic Hux Club chips

00:21:24,447 --> 00:21:25,849
from those guys for cheap,

00:21:25,915 --> 00:21:28,084
he'd have no reason to
kill either one of them.

00:21:28,151 --> 00:21:31,121
So where are we on Bruno?

00:21:31,187 --> 00:21:32,889
The deputies have been
sitting on his house

00:21:32,956 --> 00:21:35,258
and the diner.

00:21:35,325 --> 00:21:36,593
He's a no-show.

00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,662
And no gunshot wound victims
matching his description

00:21:38,728 --> 00:21:40,597
have showed up at
any of the hospitals.

00:21:40,664 --> 00:21:43,900
WILLOWS:
Well, this isn't a guy with a
whole lot of resources.

00:21:43,967 --> 00:21:45,969
Is there any other
places he might be?

00:21:46,036 --> 00:21:48,238
LANGSTON:
According to Brass,
both Huston and Bruno

00:21:48,305 --> 00:21:51,074
were doing odd construction-
destruction jobs around town.

00:21:51,141 --> 00:21:54,077
I suppose he could be
hiding out at a work site.

00:21:54,144 --> 00:21:57,047
ADAMS:
So what do you want
to do, drive around Elba?

00:21:57,113 --> 00:21:59,649
Get out every time
we see a bulldozer?

00:21:59,716 --> 00:22:01,551
The Bluebird Button Company.

00:22:01,618 --> 00:22:03,119
The what?

00:22:03,186 --> 00:22:04,988
The Bluebird Button Company.

00:22:05,055 --> 00:22:05,989
It's in Elba.

00:22:06,056 --> 00:22:08,058
They made the Hux Club chips.

00:22:08,124 --> 00:22:10,960
The company was primarily
in the pin-back button business,

00:22:11,027 --> 00:22:13,797
but it was the only company
in the western United States

00:22:13,863 --> 00:22:17,133
to be able to produce
metal-clay inlays.

00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,735
They went bankrupt way back.

00:22:18,802 --> 00:22:21,371
That factory's been
abandoned for years.

00:22:55,672 --> 00:22:57,507
I'll lead this time?

00:23:18,962 --> 00:23:20,263
Someone's been living here.

00:23:24,234 --> 00:23:26,069
Yellow exudate.

00:23:26,136 --> 00:23:30,407
Someone's nursing
a badly-infected wound.

00:23:30,473 --> 00:23:31,708
There!

00:23:37,914 --> 00:23:41,217
(groans)

00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:44,521
Go, go!
I'll call it in.

00:23:44,587 --> 00:23:49,326
Control, Officer Crawford.
Requesting a one-unit backup.

00:23:49,392 --> 00:23:51,428
DISPATCH: Officer two-one,
we have units in the vicinity.

00:23:51,494 --> 00:23:52,796
Will notify.

00:24:32,736 --> 00:24:36,439
Looks like he disappeared
into thin air.

00:24:36,506 --> 00:24:38,742
Yeah, it's like we're chasing
a ghost.

00:24:46,516 --> 00:24:47,317
Drop the gun!

00:24:47,384 --> 00:24:50,387
I said drop the gun!

00:24:50,453 --> 00:24:51,588
Drop the gun

00:24:51,655 --> 00:24:53,189
or I'll shoot!

00:24:53,256 --> 00:24:55,091
Ray, stop!

00:24:55,158 --> 00:24:58,028
This man needs
medical attention.

00:24:58,094 --> 00:25:00,330
Call it in.

00:25:00,397 --> 00:25:04,334
Control, this is
Charlie-zero-seven-Adams.

00:25:04,401 --> 00:25:08,705
I have a 421.
Roll paramedics
to my location.

00:25:08,772 --> 00:25:12,676
DISPATCH: Copy that, oh-seven. 
Paramedics en route.

00:25:38,087 --> 00:25:41,791
There's gold in them there
button factory parking lots.

00:25:41,858 --> 00:25:44,494
Or at least there was until
Schindler started slipping

00:25:44,561 --> 00:25:46,563
his chips into the market.

00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:49,032
The collectible price has
dropped 40%

00:25:49,098 --> 00:25:50,333
over the last 24 hours.

00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,502
Okay, so you're telling me

00:25:52,569 --> 00:25:55,705
that this hole in the ground was
filled with Hux Club chips?

00:25:55,772 --> 00:25:57,307
That's our theory.

00:25:57,373 --> 00:25:59,676
When Hampton Huxley pulled out
of the casino,

00:25:59,742 --> 00:26:01,978
the state had to destroy all
the chips.

00:26:02,045 --> 00:26:05,815
107,423, according
to the gaming commission.

00:26:05,882 --> 00:26:09,486
About 50 cubic feet worth.

00:26:09,552 --> 00:26:11,221
Hole was plenty big
enough for that.

00:26:11,287 --> 00:26:12,622
And they were
all sent back

00:26:12,689 --> 00:26:14,357
to the Bluebird Button
Company for destruction.

00:26:14,424 --> 00:26:15,425
Why?

00:26:15,492 --> 00:26:16,793
Well, apparently,
there was

00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,695
<i>a clause in the original</i>
<i>manufacturing contract</i>

00:26:18,761 --> 00:26:20,330
<i>that obligated them to do it.</i>

00:26:20,396 --> 00:26:21,831
(machine grinding)

00:26:21,898 --> 00:26:24,534
HODGES:
<i>Because of the way</i>
<i>the chips were made,</i>

00:26:24,601 --> 00:26:26,069
<i>they would've been extremely</i>
<i>hard to destroy.</i>

00:26:26,135 --> 00:26:27,770
<i>Brutal on the machines.</i>

00:26:27,837 --> 00:26:29,205
SANDERS:
<i>So somebody probably figured,</i>
<i>why bother?</i>

00:26:29,272 --> 00:26:33,142
♪ Don't you want me, baby? ♪

00:26:33,209 --> 00:26:36,913

00:26:39,149 --> 00:26:41,618

HODGES:
<i>Nobody ever would've known.</i>

00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,389
(jackhammer pounding,
rattling)

00:26:46,456 --> 00:26:50,360
WILLOWS:
<i>If it hadn't been for a couple</i>
<i>of down-on-their-luck guys</i>

00:26:50,426 --> 00:26:53,062
<i>who finally got lucky.</i>

00:27:00,837 --> 00:27:02,438
How is he?

00:27:02,505 --> 00:27:05,041
As well as you could expect,
under the circumstances.

00:27:05,108 --> 00:27:07,110
Brass was in there
with him for half an hour.

00:27:07,177 --> 00:27:08,344
The guy didn't say a word.

00:27:08,411 --> 00:27:11,814
That was a really stupid thing
that you did back there.

00:27:11,881 --> 00:27:14,350
He could've shot you.
I could have shot you.

00:27:14,417 --> 00:27:15,585
He needed help.

00:27:15,652 --> 00:27:17,353
He had a gun
in his hand.

00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:20,290
I didn't stop being a doctor
when I became a CSI.

00:27:20,356 --> 00:27:22,258
Well, if you keep
treating suspects
like patients,

00:27:22,325 --> 00:27:25,295
you're gonna get yourself
or someone else killed.

00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,509
Things aren't
looking too good
for you, Bruno.

00:27:39,576 --> 00:27:42,545
We have your shoe treads
in the desert.

00:27:42,612 --> 00:27:43,813
And when we run your DNA

00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,615
against the blood we found in
the backseat

00:27:45,682 --> 00:27:48,818
of your friend's car, that's
gonna come back to you, too.

00:27:48,885 --> 00:27:52,222
Best you can hope for is
accessory to murder.

00:27:52,288 --> 00:27:56,359
But I guess the detective told
you all of this.

00:27:59,629 --> 00:28:01,397
Those are

00:28:01,464 --> 00:28:02,765
phantom pains.

00:28:02,832 --> 00:28:04,167
They'll pass, after a while.

00:28:04,234 --> 00:28:06,169
How would you know that?

00:28:06,236 --> 00:28:08,938
Because I'm
a physician.

00:28:11,274 --> 00:28:14,544
And I also work
at the Crime Lab.

00:28:14,611 --> 00:28:18,748
You're that guy that jumped
into the hole with me.

00:28:21,651 --> 00:28:22,952
Why did you do that?

00:28:23,019 --> 00:28:24,487
You looked like you needed help.

00:28:24,554 --> 00:28:25,655
(scoffs)

00:28:25,722 --> 00:28:26,923
Would you like to

00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:28,391
tell me what happened
that night?

00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:30,927
I'll believe you.

00:28:30,994 --> 00:28:32,829
Just between you and me,

00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:35,031
the day you walk into court
with one leg,

00:28:35,098 --> 00:28:36,666
the jury will want
to believe you, too.

00:28:36,733 --> 00:28:39,068
But you have to tell me
what happened,

00:28:39,135 --> 00:28:42,272
and it has to be
the truth.

00:28:45,141 --> 00:28:47,143
(crying, sniffling)

00:28:50,213 --> 00:28:54,117
I wish we'd never pulled those
stupid chips out of that hole.

00:28:56,686 --> 00:29:01,191
<i>Huston and me got hired to bust</i>
<i>up this parking lot</i>

00:29:01,257 --> 00:29:02,892
<i>at the old factory.</i>

00:29:02,959 --> 00:29:07,931
<i>It was a cash deal,</i>
<i>off the books.</i>

00:29:07,997 --> 00:29:11,267
<i>That's how we found 'em.</i>

00:29:11,334 --> 00:29:14,404
<i>We figured</i>
<i>they had to be worthless.</i>

00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:17,674
<i>Otherwise, why would somebody</i>
<i>just dump 'em like that, right?</i>

00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:20,009
<i>We still had</i>
<i>to get rid of them,</i>

00:29:20,076 --> 00:29:22,512
<i>so we gathered 'em</i>
<i>all up and...</i>

00:29:22,579 --> 00:29:24,781
<i>But that Hux Club chick was</i>
<i>pretty cool,</i>

00:29:24,848 --> 00:29:29,085
<i>so we kept 'em for souvenirs,</i>
<i>gifts.</i>

00:29:29,152 --> 00:29:34,591
<i>I knew Barbie would like it for</i>
<i>her arts and crafts and stuff.</i>

00:29:36,025 --> 00:29:39,195
Anyway, about a week and a half
later, Barbie called me

00:29:39,262 --> 00:29:41,498
and said she had some guy
over at the diner

00:29:41,564 --> 00:29:43,199
that wanted to buy some chips.

00:29:43,266 --> 00:29:48,404
So Huston and me loaded up a box
and we went down there.

00:29:48,471 --> 00:29:51,808
That Schindler dude gave us
a buck apiece.

00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:54,544
Me and Huston, we pulled
thousands of those things

00:29:54,611 --> 00:29:56,412
out of that...
out of that hole,

00:29:56,479 --> 00:29:57,413
so we're thinking,

00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,916
"Holy Mother...

00:29:59,983 --> 00:30:03,186
we're rich!" (chuckles)

00:30:03,253 --> 00:30:06,890
<i>But then when we went down</i>
<i>there the next morning...</i>

00:30:12,896 --> 00:30:15,865
That son of a bitch Schindler
had swiped 'em

00:30:15,932 --> 00:30:18,034
right out from under our noses.

00:30:18,101 --> 00:30:20,703
He left us
his phone number

00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:22,739
in case we had
any more chips to sell.

00:30:22,805 --> 00:30:25,542
So we called him up
and we said we did.

00:30:25,608 --> 00:30:29,012
And we met him in Vegas,

00:30:29,078 --> 00:30:32,682
and we told him we wanted
our chips back.

00:30:32,749 --> 00:30:35,118
Lying bastard
denied everything.

00:30:35,185 --> 00:30:37,554
So you took him for a ride.

00:30:45,195 --> 00:30:47,030
Those chips are ours.

00:30:47,096 --> 00:30:48,731
You gonna show us
where you put 'em...

00:30:48,798 --> 00:30:52,001
(gun cocks)
nobody gets hurt.

00:30:53,536 --> 00:30:55,471
Little late for that, boy.

00:30:55,538 --> 00:30:57,040
(gunshot, Bruno gasps)

00:30:57,106 --> 00:30:59,175
(second gunshot, tires squeal)

00:31:00,443 --> 00:31:07,050
We ran the car off the road
and Schindler got away.

00:31:07,116 --> 00:31:13,756
I tried to chase after him,
but 'cause of my leg and all...

00:31:13,823 --> 00:31:17,794
Schindler killed Huston.

00:31:19,629 --> 00:31:21,664
He shot my best friend down.

(jazzy brass riff plays,
slowly fading out)

00:32:55,625 --> 00:32:59,095
The .38 revolver in
Bruno Curtis' possession

00:32:59,162 --> 00:33:01,698
fired the bullet that
killed Huston Dobbs.

00:33:01,764 --> 00:33:02,999
No surprise there.

00:33:03,066 --> 00:33:04,868
No, but according to Mandy,

00:33:04,934 --> 00:33:07,504
the only prints on the weapon
belong to Bruno Curtis.

00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:09,506
Schindler's prints weren't
even on the weapon?

00:33:09,572 --> 00:33:11,474
No.

00:33:11,541 --> 00:33:12,775
So, despite Bruno's statement,

00:33:12,842 --> 00:33:14,077
and even though the belt buckle

00:33:14,143 --> 00:33:16,145
could place Schindler
in the car,

00:33:16,212 --> 00:33:18,581
the only direct
murder evidence we have

00:33:18,648 --> 00:33:20,150
implicates Bruno.

00:33:21,851 --> 00:33:24,854
I guess those boots
were made for walkin'.

00:33:24,921 --> 00:33:27,457
I'm just happy to be free


00:33:27,524 --> 00:33:30,360
and, uh, I'm very pleased
that justice was served.


00:33:30,426 --> 00:33:32,028
Oh, and, uh, I wanna warn


00:33:32,095 --> 00:33:33,897
any collectors that
might be out there.


00:33:33,963 --> 00:33:37,567
Don't be taken by anybody
trying to sell you

00:33:37,634 --> 00:33:39,702
any rare collectible
Hux Club chips.

00:33:39,769 --> 00:33:42,505
There's thousands
of those things out there.


00:33:42,572 --> 00:33:45,608
To a collector they're not
worth a plug nickel. Thank you.


00:33:45,675 --> 00:33:46,809
The collectibles
trader was released

00:33:46,876 --> 00:33:48,144
from custody earlier today.

00:33:48,211 --> 00:33:51,614
One man loses his life and
another one loses his leg,

00:33:51,681 --> 00:33:54,317
and all for worthless
pieces of clay.

00:33:54,384 --> 00:33:56,586
WILLOWS:
What are you gonna do?

00:33:56,653 --> 00:34:01,791
So, um, Riley thinks that
you're a little reckless.

00:34:01,858 --> 00:34:04,427
And I think she's
a little trigger-happy.

00:34:05,461 --> 00:34:06,629
Catherine,

00:34:06,696 --> 00:34:09,599
Ray, this is
Clayton Ferris

00:34:09,666 --> 00:34:11,201
from the gaming commission.

00:34:11,267 --> 00:34:13,603
FERRIS:
As you are aware,
the Hux Club chips

00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:17,440
were supposed to have been
destroyed 28 years ago.

00:34:17,507 --> 00:34:20,276
But it was never
officially verified.

00:34:20,343 --> 00:34:22,412
In any event,

00:34:22,478 --> 00:34:25,782
since the disposal was
improperly carried out,

00:34:25,849 --> 00:34:28,985
the existing chips continue
to be bearer instruments

00:34:29,052 --> 00:34:32,589
and the State of Nevada is on
the line for their face value.

00:34:32,655 --> 00:34:34,424
You mean anyone holding
those chips can just

00:34:34,491 --> 00:34:37,427
walk in and trade
them in for cash?

00:34:37,494 --> 00:34:39,429
Yes.
WILLOWS:
Wait a minute.

00:34:39,496 --> 00:34:42,098
The window for all chip
redemptions is 120 days

00:34:42,165 --> 00:34:44,000
from the original recall.

00:34:44,067 --> 00:34:49,706
The... attorneys who drafted
the original Hux Club contract

00:34:49,772 --> 00:34:52,642
apparently left
that provision out.

00:34:52,709 --> 00:34:54,811
The Great State of Nevada,

00:34:54,878 --> 00:34:58,815
of course, will honor
its obligation

00:34:58,882 --> 00:34:59,849
to redeem the chips.

00:34:59,916 --> 00:35:03,520
However, the argument
can be made

00:35:03,586 --> 00:35:06,556
that the chips are,
in fact, stolen property

00:35:06,623 --> 00:35:10,326
and still outstanding evidence
in a murder investigation.

00:35:10,393 --> 00:35:12,162
So, you want us to find
the chips before anyone

00:35:12,228 --> 00:35:13,663
else does and tries
to cash them in.

00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:15,465
We feel that that would be

00:35:15,532 --> 00:35:18,568
in the best interests
of all concerned.

00:35:20,603 --> 00:35:22,005
(phone ringing)

00:35:22,071 --> 00:35:24,174
Yeah, what's up, professor?

00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,175
Have you talked to
Wiley Schindler yet?

00:35:25,241 --> 00:35:26,242
No, we're looking for him.

00:35:26,309 --> 00:35:27,377
He checked out of the hotel,

00:35:27,443 --> 00:35:28,511
he wasn't at the trade show.

00:35:28,578 --> 00:35:29,913
If he left town with the chips,

00:35:29,979 --> 00:35:31,147
he's got a big head start.

00:35:31,214 --> 00:35:33,616
Did Barbie from the
coffee shop say anything?

00:35:33,683 --> 00:35:35,351
No, I, uh...

00:35:35,418 --> 00:35:36,753
just arrived at her house

00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:39,522
about 15 minutes ago.

00:35:39,589 --> 00:35:43,593
And, unfortunately...

00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:45,595
She's not talking.

00:36:05,087 --> 00:36:08,457
Single large-caliber GSW.

00:36:08,524 --> 00:36:10,926
There's no lividity; she's
been dead less than an hour.

00:36:10,993 --> 00:36:13,729
You must've just
missed the bad guy.

00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:16,098
She's got defensive
wounds on her arms.

00:36:16,165 --> 00:36:17,366
LANGSTON:
I found a box

00:36:17,433 --> 00:36:18,767
of .44-caliber shells,

00:36:18,834 --> 00:36:19,902
six were missing.

00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:21,370
Haven't found the weapon yet.

00:36:21,437 --> 00:36:23,939
There were no signs
of forced entry,

00:36:24,006 --> 00:36:25,374
which suggests that
she knew her killer.

00:36:25,441 --> 00:36:27,710
Yeah, but it looks
like a robbery.

00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:29,678
To steal what?

00:36:29,745 --> 00:36:31,280
Everybody outside of
the gaming commission

00:36:31,347 --> 00:36:32,915
and the Crime Lab thinks that
(phone ringing)

00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:34,383
these chips
are worthless.

00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:35,617
Jim?

00:36:36,952 --> 00:36:39,088
Okay.

00:36:39,154 --> 00:36:42,124
Thank you.

00:36:42,191 --> 00:36:44,360
P.D. just picked up
Wiley Schindler

00:36:44,426 --> 00:36:47,630
at McCarran trying to board
a plane back to Kansas City.

00:36:47,696 --> 00:36:50,099
His carry-ons were
packed with two cases

00:36:50,165 --> 00:36:52,034
of Hux Club chips.

00:36:52,101 --> 00:36:54,536
And we let him out the door.

00:36:54,603 --> 00:36:57,640
Well, I'm going back to the lab.

00:36:57,706 --> 00:36:59,708
Why don't you
finish up here?

00:37:09,184 --> 00:37:12,221
So, tell me something, Wiley.

00:37:12,288 --> 00:37:15,224
Where'd you get the chips
this time?

00:37:15,291 --> 00:37:19,061
From that gal at the diner--
Miss, um, Aubrey.

00:37:19,128 --> 00:37:21,063
I went by her place
this morning,

00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:22,564
made a fair deal for them.

00:37:22,631 --> 00:37:24,033
You know, her buds,
you know,

00:37:24,099 --> 00:37:26,302
you remember Stumpy
and Hole-in-the-Head.

00:37:26,368 --> 00:37:28,404
They were the ones
who found them.

00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:30,205
So, what made you think
Barbie had any?

00:37:30,272 --> 00:37:32,408
Because she was their bud.

00:37:32,474 --> 00:37:34,476
I figured she might know

00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:36,578
where the stash was.

00:37:36,645 --> 00:37:38,580
And I have a
sentimental attachment

00:37:38,647 --> 00:37:40,649
to the Hux Club era, so...
Come on, man,

00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:42,084
don't lie to me.

00:37:42,151 --> 00:37:43,786
You're not a sentimental guy.

00:37:45,387 --> 00:37:48,090
Okay, I've got a friend
in the gaming commission.

00:37:48,157 --> 00:37:50,492
And I heard that the
chips might still have

00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:53,262
cash value with the state.
Right...

00:37:53,329 --> 00:37:57,032
So, you went to Barbie and got
all the high denomination ones

00:37:57,099 --> 00:37:59,034
before she found out
what they were worth, right?

00:37:59,101 --> 00:38:00,836
Yeah.

00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:02,204
So what?

00:38:02,271 --> 00:38:04,206
So, she's dead.

00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,609
When I left her, she was smiling

00:38:07,676 --> 00:38:10,279
and holding $2,000 in cash.

00:38:10,346 --> 00:38:12,614
You got a knack for making
dead people happy.

00:38:12,681 --> 00:38:14,984
I put my damn business card

00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:16,618
on the bank roll.

00:38:16,685 --> 00:38:20,556
If I killed her, why
in the hell would I do that?

00:38:20,623 --> 00:38:24,360
Hey, Catherine,
I got something
you'll want to see.

00:38:24,426 --> 00:38:25,761
Remember those
online auctions

00:38:25,828 --> 00:38:27,062
we were tracking?
Yeah.

00:38:27,129 --> 00:38:28,964
Well, a significant number

00:38:29,031 --> 00:38:30,833
of Hux Club chips
were put on the market

00:38:30,899 --> 00:38:32,568
while Schindler was
still in custody.

00:38:32,635 --> 00:38:34,336
I know that Barbie Aubrey
had some.

00:38:34,403 --> 00:38:35,671
It was probably her.

00:38:35,738 --> 00:38:37,006
That's what
I thought, too.

00:38:37,072 --> 00:38:39,041
So, I checked in
with a couple people

00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:41,276
at the collectibles show
to confirm.

00:38:41,343 --> 00:38:44,747
Nobody recognized Barbie,
but several described a man--

00:38:44,813 --> 00:38:47,549
not Schindler-- who was
peddling Hux Club chips.

00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:49,885
This is surveillance
video from the venue.

00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:52,221
The guy on the left

00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:54,757
was apparently
there for hours.

00:38:54,823 --> 00:38:57,893
Eventually made
several cash sales.

00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,395
Any idea who he is?

00:38:59,461 --> 00:39:01,397
No, but...

00:39:01,463 --> 00:39:05,834
lucky for us, he paid his
bar tab with his credit card.

00:39:05,901 --> 00:39:07,836
OFFICER:
No, I got units on it.

00:39:07,903 --> 00:39:09,204
Hello?

00:39:32,494 --> 00:39:34,730
ELLIS: I don't care who called
in sick, you can't just

00:39:34,797 --> 00:39:36,598
change the schedule on me
at the last minute.

00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:39,001
I'm in Vegas on business,
like I told you.

00:39:39,068 --> 00:39:41,403
Stop hounding me!

00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:54,917
SANDERS:
<i>All right, his name</i>
<i>is Walter Ellis.</i>

00:39:54,984 --> 00:39:58,387
He's a busboy
at the diner.

00:39:58,454 --> 00:40:00,055
Well, the address
on this statement

00:40:00,122 --> 00:40:01,657
is the same as Barbie's.

00:40:01,724 --> 00:40:04,493
They live together?

00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,529
Or they're married.

00:40:07,596 --> 00:40:10,232
Maybe Schindler was telling
the truth the whole time.

00:40:10,299 --> 00:40:11,500
What if Barbie
stole the chips

00:40:11,567 --> 00:40:12,735
from Bruno and Huston

00:40:12,801 --> 00:40:16,939
<i>and Walter then</i>
<i>stole them from her?</i>

00:40:18,007 --> 00:40:19,441
What are you doing?

00:40:19,508 --> 00:40:21,777
These are my chips, moron!

00:40:21,844 --> 00:40:22,945
They're half mine, you bitch!

00:40:23,012 --> 00:40:25,814
No, they're not!
You're an idiot!

00:42:05,848 --> 00:42:07,149

13 years of living
with that bitch!

00:42:13,789 --> 00:42:16,058
I'm getting out!
