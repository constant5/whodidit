we're gonna get him.

Suspect is a white male,

Stay with me! Warrick...

00:01:38,395 --> 00:01:39,597
It's Grissom.

00:01:42,233 --> 00:01:44,635
I was first
on the scene.

00:01:44,635 --> 00:01:46,437

I was on my way to the diner.

00:04:09,899 --> 00:04:14,070
I was going to tell
Warrick in person that
he could keep his job.

00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,938
I parked my car
over there

00:04:15,938 --> 00:04:17,740
just before 4:30.

00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:22,678
I started to walk west
towards the diner.

00:04:22,678 --> 00:04:26,315
I was in this area here

he was dead.

00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,632

George-Robert-Victor-
Zebra-9-0-3?

00:05:04,954 --> 00:05:06,756
That's Officer
Pritchard's car.

00:05:06,756 --> 00:05:08,925
Was it a black
Chrysler 300?
Uh...

00:05:08,925 --> 00:05:10,226
Was it Pritchard
you saw?

00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:11,661

00:05:11,661 --> 00:05:13,396

00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:15,398

00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,300
Okay.

00:05:53,169 --> 00:05:55,271
Have you photoed
the body yet?

00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:57,106
I haven't done anything.

00:06:07,517 --> 00:06:09,652

to handle this?

00:06:14,557 --> 00:06:17,060

Catherine on the car.

00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:21,364
Okay.

from the airport.

your clothes to get processed.

He didn't carry a backup.

Looks like Pritchard's been
taking lessons from Gedda.

00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:11,134
There were at least
two shots fired.

00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:12,869
One of which came
from inside the car.

00:09:19,442 --> 00:09:20,676
Window was down.

He stuck the gun

00:09:28,418 --> 00:09:29,719
through the open
window and fired.

00:09:33,022 --> 00:09:35,792
If you're right, there should be
GSR on that headliner.

00:09:48,438 --> 00:09:49,906
It's positive for lead.

00:09:49,906 --> 00:09:52,075

The assignments are
going to break down
generally like this--

00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:18,167
some of you go to the
airport with photos.

00:10:18,167 --> 00:10:19,635
If Pritchard tries
to get on a plane,

00:10:19,635 --> 00:10:21,137
we grab him.

00:10:21,137 --> 00:10:24,474
Now, Vegas highway patrol is
already setting up roadblocks

00:10:24,474 --> 00:10:26,509

out of the city.

00:10:26,509 --> 00:10:29,812
Now, we have the addresses
of his ex-wife, his family,

00:10:29,812 --> 00:10:32,081
his friends,
all his known associates.

00:10:32,081 --> 00:10:34,117
Most of you will be
following those leads.

00:10:34,117 --> 00:10:36,252
Now look under
every rock.

00:10:36,252 --> 00:10:38,054

spitting distance,

00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,556

He didn't want to go, Sara.

00:11:29,038 --> 00:11:31,674
Tell me.

00:11:31,674 --> 00:11:34,177
I was holding him.

00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:41,217
God, I could feel his life.

I guess I felt
if I could...

hold him tight enough,

00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,860
he'd be okay.

00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,895
You know there is nowhere
in the world

00:11:52,895 --> 00:11:56,699
that he would've rather been
at the end.

00:11:56,699 --> 00:11:58,735
He loved you.

00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,872
Yeah. I loved him.

00:12:04,941 --> 00:12:06,709
Oh.

00:12:09,379 --> 00:12:11,681
I'm so sorry.

00:12:11,681 --> 00:12:14,951
It's so good we can all
be together.

00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,555
I'm glad you're here.

(Stokes sniffles,

00:12:29,058 --> 00:12:31,927
Look, maybe I can pick
up some of the slack.

00:12:31,927 --> 00:12:34,463
I-I know I can't work the case,
but maybe I can make

00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:36,966
some of the, uh... arrangements?

00:12:36,966 --> 00:12:38,701
That'd be great.

00:12:38,701 --> 00:12:40,269
I'll help you.

00:12:40,269 --> 00:12:42,471
I'd appreciate that.

00:12:42,471 --> 00:12:43,773
Since his grandmother passed,

00:12:43,773 --> 00:12:45,408
we were
the only family he had.

00:12:45,408 --> 00:12:47,476
He once told me he'd like
to be buried next to her.

00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:50,379
I went to her funeral
with Warrick.

00:12:50,379 --> 00:12:53,716
She's, uh, buried

00:12:53,716 --> 00:12:56,052
at the Baptist cemetery
on Eastern.

00:12:56,052 --> 00:12:59,588
We're going to need a... a key,
I guess, to his place.

00:12:59,588 --> 00:13:01,057
WILLOWS:
I've got one.

00:13:01,057 --> 00:13:03,859
I went over to his place

00:13:03,859 --> 00:13:07,196
to get him some fresh clothes
when he was in custody.

00:13:07,196 --> 00:13:09,932
STOKES:
Warrick was right about Gedda.

00:13:09,932 --> 00:13:12,668
And he was right
about the department.

00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:18,040
Let's finish this for him.

00:13:24,246 --> 00:13:25,648
Hey, Jim.

00:13:25,648 --> 00:13:27,216
Hey.

00:13:27,216 --> 00:13:31,754
Look, uh, there's something
I need to get off my chest.

00:13:31,754 --> 00:13:33,556
Okay.

00:13:33,556 --> 00:13:36,225
I know that you and
Warrick were close.

00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,629
And I don't want you to think
that I had it in for the guy.

00:13:42,598 --> 00:13:45,101
Why would I think that, Jeff?

00:13:45,101 --> 00:13:48,571
(chuckling):
I don't know.

00:13:48,571 --> 00:13:50,773
Maybe I'm feeling guilty.

00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:56,812
I thought Brown
was a bad apple.

00:13:56,812 --> 00:13:58,914
I was certain that
he killed Gedda.

00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:03,586
And I was wrong.

00:14:05,488 --> 00:14:08,057
I know it's a little late
for apologies,

00:14:08,057 --> 00:14:11,260
but I-I... I just wanted
to tell you.

00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,729
Hey, we all have regrets.

00:14:15,498 --> 00:14:17,566
I thought he killed Gedda, too.

00:14:19,935 --> 00:14:22,805
You know what the last thing
I told him was?

00:14:22,805 --> 00:14:24,373
No.

00:14:24,373 --> 00:14:27,543
"I hope you remember
how lucky you are."

00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:31,647
Some luck, huh?

00:14:32,682 --> 00:14:35,518
(softly):
Yeah.

00:14:37,253 --> 00:14:38,988
Thanks.

You know, after being
in so many victims' houses,

00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:48,177
I never left my house
without making the bed

00:17:48,177 --> 00:17:50,646
and taking out the trash, just
in case I didn't come home.

00:17:50,646 --> 00:17:54,150
What about now?

00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:58,187
Since I left Vegas,
I don't do that anymore.

00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:02,358

00:18:02,358 --> 00:18:04,593
Yeah, I'm on it.

Did you know?

00:18:32,221 --> 00:18:33,956
He never mentioned it.

00:18:33,956 --> 00:18:35,558
At least not to me.

00:18:36,992 --> 00:18:39,061
This is from his attorney.

00:18:39,061 --> 00:18:42,932

No recoverable DNA.

00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:03,853
The serial number
was filed down,

00:19:03,853 --> 00:19:05,554
but I got one on the grip.

00:19:05,554 --> 00:19:07,256
Traced it back
to an armed robbery.

00:19:07,256 --> 00:19:09,725
Pritchard was
the arresting officer.

00:19:09,725 --> 00:19:12,261
The case was adjudicated,
and according to the log,

00:19:12,261 --> 00:19:14,363
the gun was destroyed
last July.

00:19:14,363 --> 00:19:15,798
Or not.

00:19:15,798 --> 00:19:17,900
Pritchard stole it
from Central Property.

00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,536
He had to have somebody on
the inside to fudge the records.

00:19:20,536 --> 00:19:22,371
Maybe Gedda's got another
cop on the take.

00:19:22,371 --> 00:19:24,373
But why would Pritchard
kill Warrick with a gun

00:19:24,373 --> 00:19:25,908
that could be
traced back to him?

00:19:25,908 --> 00:19:27,076
'Cause he didn't care.

00:19:27,076 --> 00:19:29,311
He's in the wind.

00:19:29,311 --> 00:19:30,546
I got something.

00:19:31,647 --> 00:19:33,616
When I rolled up the
passenger side window,

00:19:33,616 --> 00:19:37,586
I found a cluster of
impressions on the glass.

00:19:37,586 --> 00:19:40,823
No ridge structure, so
they're not fingerprints.

00:19:40,823 --> 00:19:42,458
They're... knuckle prints.

00:19:44,827 --> 00:19:47,463
The stereo was turned down low.

00:19:47,463 --> 00:19:50,666
The only fingerprints on the
volume knob are Warrick's.

00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:53,736
And... if you've ever ridden
with him, you know he'd...

00:19:53,736 --> 00:19:55,705
he'd make your eardrums bleed.

00:19:55,705 --> 00:19:57,640
So...

00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:02,545
volume turned down,
knuckle prints on the glass.

00:20:02,545 --> 00:20:05,915
I think the killer
knocked on his window.

00:20:10,586 --> 00:20:12,655
Well, Warrick would have never

00:20:12,655 --> 00:20:14,490
rolled down his window
for Pritchard.

00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:17,093
No. No, not after he'd just
killed Gedda

00:20:17,093 --> 00:20:20,129
and he was trying
to frame Warrick for the murder.

00:20:20,129 --> 00:20:23,532
Are we saying
it's not Pritchard?

00:20:23,532 --> 00:20:25,267
I think we are.

00:20:27,036 --> 00:20:28,471
McKeen.

00:20:28,471 --> 00:20:30,473
He's the only eyewitness.

00:20:30,473 --> 00:20:33,542
He's the one that placed
somebody that looked like
Pritchard in the alley.

00:20:33,542 --> 00:20:36,712
He's the one that said the
suspect got into a vehicle

00:20:36,712 --> 00:20:40,049
with a partial plate
that was a match to Pritchard's.

00:20:44,387 --> 00:20:46,322
There's something
you need to see.

00:20:46,322 --> 00:20:48,424
Has to wait.
We're going back to the alley.

00:20:48,424 --> 00:20:49,892
It can't wait.

00:20:49,892 --> 00:20:53,029
WOMAN:
So what makes you think
you'd be a good father?

00:20:53,029 --> 00:20:55,264
You were raised
by your grandmother.

00:20:55,264 --> 00:20:56,899
You never even knew
your biological father.

00:20:56,899 --> 00:20:59,668
Which is exactly
why Eli needs to know his.

00:21:01,504 --> 00:21:03,706
Look, the most important thing
you need to know

00:21:03,706 --> 00:21:07,076
to raise a child
is how to give a child love.

00:21:07,076 --> 00:21:09,045
And I've been loved.

00:21:11,213 --> 00:21:13,549
Listen, I've always tried
to be a good man.

00:21:13,549 --> 00:21:15,251
I've screwed up.

00:21:15,251 --> 00:21:18,187
And when I have, there's always
been one man in my life

00:21:18,187 --> 00:21:19,755
that set me straight.

00:21:19,755 --> 00:21:23,893
I've learned a lot from him.

00:21:23,893 --> 00:21:25,528
How to be fair.

00:21:25,528 --> 00:21:28,397
How to forgive.

00:21:28,397 --> 00:21:30,433
How to be inspired.

00:21:30,433 --> 00:21:34,470
How to inspire others.

00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:36,272
WOMAN:
That sounds
like a special person.

00:21:36,272 --> 00:21:38,007
He is.

00:21:40,042 --> 00:21:44,080
If I could've picked
my own father,

00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,248
I'd have picked him.

00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:55,885
We're ready
on this end.

00:21:55,885 --> 00:21:57,387
GRISSOM:
McKeen said he was

00:21:57,387 --> 00:22:00,824
about 20 feet west of the alley
when he heard the shots.

00:22:00,824 --> 00:22:02,058
I'm there.

00:22:03,092 --> 00:22:04,727
Let's do this.

00:22:04,727 --> 00:22:06,496
Firing two.

00:22:08,097 --> 00:22:09,666
(gunshot in distance)

00:22:14,871 --> 00:22:16,206

00:22:16,206 --> 00:22:18,208

00:22:19,576 --> 00:22:22,512
(techno-pop plays)

00:22:22,512 --> 00:22:24,347
(music stops)

00:22:24,347 --> 00:22:26,015
Gil, what is it?

00:22:26,015 --> 00:22:28,284
I just realized something--
there was music,

00:22:28,284 --> 00:22:30,854
loud music coming from here.

00:22:30,854 --> 00:22:33,256
We need to do this again.

00:22:33,256 --> 00:22:34,591
Okay.

00:22:34,591 --> 00:22:36,392
Come on back.

00:22:36,392 --> 00:22:39,429
(loud techno-pop playing)
This is the volume level
from around

00:22:39,429 --> 00:22:41,030
4:00 a.m. last night.

00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:43,867
(loud music continues)

00:22:45,568 --> 00:22:47,871
(shouts):
Go ahead, Nicky!

00:22:47,871 --> 00:22:50,874
(music continues)

00:22:50,874 --> 00:22:52,442
(gunshot)

00:22:52,442 --> 00:22:54,444
(gunshot)

00:22:56,246 --> 00:22:58,381
(loud music continues)

00:22:58,381 --> 00:23:00,283
Where are you?

00:23:00,283 --> 00:23:03,453
I didn't hear any shots.

00:23:06,222 --> 00:23:08,792
GRISSOM:
There's no way that McKeen
heard those shots.

00:23:08,792 --> 00:23:11,127
So why did he say he did?

00:23:11,127 --> 00:23:12,929
He also implied

00:23:12,929 --> 00:23:15,732
that he saw Pritchard running
away from Warrick's car.

00:23:15,732 --> 00:23:17,801
But he never said
it <i>was</i> Pritchard.

00:23:17,801 --> 00:23:20,603
He led us to believe
that though.
(sighs)

00:23:20,603 --> 00:23:23,907
You know, when I first came
to Vegas, over 20 years ago--

00:23:23,907 --> 00:23:26,609
I haven't thought
about this in a while--

00:23:26,609 --> 00:23:29,145
Jeff McKeen was
a detective then,

00:23:29,145 --> 00:23:32,115
he invited us all up
to Mount Charleston to
his cabin, you know,

00:23:32,115 --> 00:23:33,283
all the new guys.

00:23:33,283 --> 00:23:34,717
Have a barbecue,
we'll cook some steaks,

00:23:34,717 --> 00:23:37,120
have a few drinks, get
to know each other, you know?

00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,488
And it was a nice place,

00:23:38,488 --> 00:23:41,224
you know, but not <i>too</i>
nice for detective pay.

00:23:41,224 --> 00:23:43,026
I mean, my radar's
already out

00:23:43,026 --> 00:23:44,861
because I came from
Jersey, you know?

00:23:44,861 --> 00:23:46,196
Guys...

00:23:46,196 --> 00:23:47,697
took more than they gave.

00:23:47,697 --> 00:23:50,767
And they made an art form,
how not to push it,

00:23:50,767 --> 00:23:52,702
how not to make it showy,
you know.

00:23:52,702 --> 00:23:55,705
Anyway, Jeff is sizing me
up, he's sniffing around,

00:23:55,705 --> 00:23:57,440
he's telling me
great Vegas is,

00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,476
how great it'd be
for my career.

00:23:59,476 --> 00:24:03,079
But I let him know,
without busting his balls,

00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:06,583
that I wasn't in the game,
I wasn't for sale.

00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:09,285
And it's a good thing
I took a look around

00:24:09,285 --> 00:24:10,553
up there at Mount Charleston,

00:24:10,553 --> 00:24:12,188
because I never
got invited again.

00:24:12,188 --> 00:24:14,624
No more
barbecues for me.

00:24:14,624 --> 00:24:16,359
Hmm.

00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:19,996
First witness at the scene
is the first suspect, right?

00:24:19,996 --> 00:24:21,998
Right.

00:24:21,998 --> 00:24:25,201
When I told Warrick
that Pritchard had framed him,

00:24:25,201 --> 00:24:26,736
he said that Gedda's mole

00:24:26,736 --> 00:24:29,205
had to be higher up
on the food chain.

00:24:29,205 --> 00:24:32,208
If I were McKeen,

00:24:32,208 --> 00:24:35,645
I would worry that Warrick
would <i>never</i> let it go.

00:24:35,645 --> 00:24:38,681
It'd take more
than a beat cop to...

00:24:38,681 --> 00:24:40,817
get over on that fat bastard.

00:24:40,817 --> 00:24:45,622
I'd think it's got to be
somebody much higher up.

00:24:45,622 --> 00:24:49,225
Let's say that McKeen saw
the interview video.

00:24:49,225 --> 00:24:51,227
From the time that
Warrick left the PD

00:24:51,227 --> 00:24:52,962
to the time that
Warrick got killed

00:24:52,962 --> 00:24:55,198
was, like, an hour,
an hour and a half.

00:24:55,198 --> 00:24:57,033
Is that enough time
to frame Pritchard?

00:24:57,033 --> 00:24:59,936
For all we know,
Pritchard's not
even in Vegas.

00:24:59,936 --> 00:25:03,173
Yeah, but if Pritchard
gets picked up somewhere else,

00:25:03,173 --> 00:25:05,208
that gives him an alibi,

00:25:05,208 --> 00:25:07,076
and McKeen is screwed.

00:25:07,076 --> 00:25:11,114
Unless he knows
exactly where Pritchard is.

00:25:19,055 --> 00:25:20,590
(lock beeps)

00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:24,594
(baseball game
playing quietly on TV)

SPORTS ANNOUNCER:
But right now,

00:25:32,602 --> 00:25:35,305
Los Angeles doesn't appear
to be in a helping mood.

00:25:35,305 --> 00:25:36,506
Two-one count.

00:25:36,506 --> 00:25:38,741
Jason delivers.

00:25:38,741 --> 00:25:40,777
And there's a flare
to right field!

00:25:40,777 --> 00:25:43,046
I can't believe Bobby Cox
is still managing.

00:25:43,046 --> 00:25:44,581
What took you
so long?

00:25:44,581 --> 00:25:46,316
I'm starving here.

00:25:46,316 --> 00:25:48,785
I thought
I was clear with you.

00:25:48,785 --> 00:25:49,953
About what?

00:25:49,953 --> 00:25:51,254
Where's my food?

00:25:51,254 --> 00:25:53,423
I told you
not to leave the room.

00:25:53,423 --> 00:25:55,925
I didn't.

00:25:55,925 --> 00:25:58,027
Scout's honor.

00:25:59,429 --> 00:26:01,431
Why would I
leave the room?

00:26:01,431 --> 00:26:03,600
I'm trying to leave the country.

00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,769
You killed Brown
on the way out.

00:26:05,769 --> 00:26:07,070
I get it.

00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:09,706
But now you made a mess,

00:26:09,706 --> 00:26:11,875
and I got to clean it up.

00:26:11,875 --> 00:26:13,877
You think I killed Brown?

00:26:13,877 --> 00:26:15,145
Come on, who else?

00:26:15,145 --> 00:26:16,479
I just framed the guy--

00:26:16,479 --> 00:26:18,681
why would I want him dead;
I wanted him in jail.

00:26:18,681 --> 00:26:20,850
If I wanted him dead,
I would've shot him in Pigalle

00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:22,452
instead of going through
all this freakin' crap.

00:26:22,452 --> 00:26:26,055
The murder weapon was traced
back to one of your cases.

00:26:26,055 --> 00:26:28,124
What case?
What are you talking about?

00:26:28,124 --> 00:26:31,060
An armed robbery, I believe.

00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,896
A .25.

00:26:32,896 --> 00:26:35,064
Judge ordered it destroyed.

00:26:35,064 --> 00:26:37,567
Oh.

00:26:37,567 --> 00:26:39,235
That gun.

00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:41,771
Look,

00:26:41,771 --> 00:26:45,675
you can blame everything on me
when I'm in Mexico,

00:26:45,675 --> 00:26:47,911
but I'm not in Mexico yet.

00:26:47,911 --> 00:26:50,747
Killing you might
just be easier.

00:26:50,747 --> 00:26:52,816
Then do it.

00:26:52,816 --> 00:26:55,218
You shoot me here...

00:26:55,218 --> 00:26:58,321
you're gonna have
a lot of explaining to do.

00:27:00,723 --> 00:27:04,794
We going to Mexico, or what?

00:27:07,497 --> 00:27:10,099
Gil, you take this
to the wrong judge,

00:27:10,099 --> 00:27:12,435
and McKeen finds out
he's being investigated,

00:27:12,435 --> 00:27:15,572
he'll stick a fork
in all of us.

00:27:15,572 --> 00:27:18,374
I think that's a risk
we're all willing to take.

00:27:18,374 --> 00:27:21,678
Well, all I'm saying is,
let's be smart about it.

00:27:21,678 --> 00:27:23,680
Get more evidence.

00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,315
We got what we got.

00:27:25,315 --> 00:27:26,950
Knuckle prints on glass.

00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:29,452
SANDERS:
Yeah, but knuckle prints
can't be individualized.

00:27:29,452 --> 00:27:30,854
Even if we had exemplars,

00:27:30,854 --> 00:27:33,089
we couldn't exclude Pritchard
or include McKeen.

00:27:33,089 --> 00:27:34,958
All right, wh-what
about the murder weapon?

00:27:34,958 --> 00:27:37,560
We printed it,
swabbed it for DNA.

00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,229
It was wiped clean.

00:27:39,229 --> 00:27:40,597
SIDLE:
The gun was evidence

00:27:40,597 --> 00:27:42,132
in an armed robbery
case, right?

00:27:42,132 --> 00:27:43,700
Was there any
ammo with it?

00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,068
No.

00:27:45,068 --> 00:27:47,337
So if McKeen lifted
the gun from Evidence,

00:27:47,337 --> 00:27:49,105
he still had to load it.

00:27:49,105 --> 00:27:51,307
WILLOWS:
No prints on the magazine.

00:27:51,307 --> 00:27:52,675
What about the bullets?

00:27:52,675 --> 00:27:54,110
ECKLIE:
A .25?

00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:57,180
We've never gotten prints
off a cartridge that small.

00:27:59,082 --> 00:28:02,218

00:28:37,654 --> 00:28:39,656

00:28:39,656 --> 00:28:42,158
That is one tiny partial.

00:28:42,158 --> 00:28:44,794
This may be f-four millimeters.

00:28:45,929 --> 00:28:48,298
So we got one shot.
Yeah.

00:28:48,298 --> 00:28:51,067
So don't screw it up, right?

00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:13,123
Just enough for a comparison.

00:29:13,123 --> 00:29:16,359
Here, compare it to
Pritchard's ten card.

00:29:26,669 --> 00:29:28,772
It's not Pritchard's print.

00:29:31,207 --> 00:29:33,042
Thank you, Mandy.

00:29:33,042 --> 00:29:36,045
I need you to step out.

00:29:37,147 --> 00:29:39,048
You're kidding, right?

00:29:39,048 --> 00:29:41,384
No, I'm not.

we all understand

00:30:33,603 --> 00:30:35,238
But we're under
a lot of pressure,

00:30:35,238 --> 00:30:37,240
and we have to move fast.

00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:40,944
No, I didn't call the mayor--
I wanted to call you first.

00:30:40,944 --> 00:30:43,379
He's not at home,
he's not at work,

00:30:43,379 --> 00:30:46,349
and if we tip him off,
he'll run.

00:30:46,349 --> 00:30:48,918
Judge... Judge...

00:30:48,918 --> 00:30:52,222

STOKES:
Eliminate any

00:31:09,272 --> 00:31:13,042
that are work-related,
from a PD number.

00:31:16,312 --> 00:31:18,248
Three calls
from the same number.

00:31:18,248 --> 00:31:20,583
Do a reverse look-up.

00:31:26,456 --> 00:31:28,691
Whiskey Bend.

00:31:28,691 --> 00:31:32,162
That's a place you
go to get lost.

00:31:33,663 --> 00:31:35,165
He recognized McKeen.

00:31:35,165 --> 00:31:36,533
Said he paid cash.

00:31:36,533 --> 00:31:39,035
Wasn't staying here--
it was for his buddy.

00:31:39,035 --> 00:31:41,504
"Do not disturb,"
give me a break.

00:31:41,504 --> 00:31:43,173
Okay, go ahead.

00:31:52,615 --> 00:31:54,617
Okay, come on.

00:31:56,219 --> 00:31:58,221
It's clear, Captain.

00:32:04,494 --> 00:32:06,429
Ice in the glass.

00:32:06,429 --> 00:32:08,064
Wet towel.

00:32:08,064 --> 00:32:09,632
We just missed him.

00:32:15,405 --> 00:32:17,474
(country music plays
as radio stations change)

00:32:17,474 --> 00:32:19,642
Pick a station and go with it.

00:32:19,642 --> 00:32:21,811
You're driving me crazy.
It's all country.

00:32:21,811 --> 00:32:24,147
I don't like country.

00:32:24,147 --> 00:32:26,649
Yeah, well, at least
they're all in English.

00:32:26,649 --> 00:32:28,051

00:32:51,376 --> 00:32:52,844
ID's confirmed.

00:32:52,844 --> 00:32:54,279
Pritchard was in the room.

00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:57,616
McKeen's had this room
for four days.

00:32:57,616 --> 00:32:59,117
Pritchard's probably been
holed up here

00:32:59,117 --> 00:33:00,452
ever since he killed Gedda.

00:33:00,452 --> 00:33:02,754
Pritchard's his problem solver.

00:33:02,754 --> 00:33:04,055
McKeen is protecting him.

00:33:04,055 --> 00:33:05,290
STOKES:
Not anymore.

00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:08,526
He killed Warrick.
Now he needs a fall guy.

00:33:08,526 --> 00:33:10,595
Which makes Pritchard
a dead man.

00:33:10,595 --> 00:33:12,564
Hey, Jeff, it's Jim Brass.

00:33:12,564 --> 00:33:15,200
Well, looks like
Pritchard is our guy.
(phone rings)

00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,937
All the evidence points
that way.

00:33:18,937 --> 00:33:20,205
No, we're still looking.

00:33:20,205 --> 00:33:22,574
I'll put an APB out on him
right away.

00:33:22,574 --> 00:33:24,309
Keep you posted.

00:33:24,309 --> 00:33:26,244
Yeah, Brass is talking
to him now.

00:33:26,244 --> 00:33:29,614
Archie's working on
triangulating his cell.

00:33:31,816 --> 00:33:34,786
BRASS:
Jeff, you're breaking up.
Are you in your car?

00:33:34,786 --> 00:33:37,622
Yeah, sure, get some rest.

00:33:37,622 --> 00:33:39,624
The press is gonna want
a statement from you

00:33:39,624 --> 00:33:41,459
when we bring Pritchard
into custody.

00:33:41,459 --> 00:33:44,162
STOKES:
McKeen's with Pritchard.
You have his 20?

00:33:44,162 --> 00:33:45,230
Not yet.

00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:46,831
(computer trills)

00:33:46,831 --> 00:33:49,734
Got him.

00:33:49,734 --> 00:33:51,503
He just moved from tower
eight to tower nine.

00:33:51,503 --> 00:33:54,406
He's heading east
on Boulder Highway

00:33:54,406 --> 00:33:57,842
about a mile west
of Highway 166.

00:34:00,011 --> 00:34:02,814
Let me know
when you got him, Jim.

00:34:02,814 --> 00:34:05,083
Got who?

00:34:05,083 --> 00:34:06,985
Relax.

00:34:06,985 --> 00:34:10,188
What happens when we get
to the state line?

00:34:10,188 --> 00:34:12,490
Every cop in Nevada's
got a picture of my mug.

00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:14,459
Don't worry about it.

00:34:14,459 --> 00:34:16,962
I got a radio on.

00:34:16,962 --> 00:34:18,863
Anything happens,
I'll hear about it.

00:34:18,863 --> 00:34:20,665
I'm the undersheriff,
remember?

00:34:20,665 --> 00:34:22,300
Nobody's gonna search my car.

00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,236
In 12 hours,
you'll be sitting

00:34:24,236 --> 00:34:27,739
on a beach in Mexico
sipping margaritas.

00:34:31,776 --> 00:34:33,678
What's so freakin' funny?

00:34:33,678 --> 00:34:36,514
What, are you gonna shoot me
going 80 miles an hour?

00:34:36,514 --> 00:34:41,319
<i>You think I'd let you get in</i>
<i>this car with a loaded gun?</i>

00:34:41,319 --> 00:34:43,321
(laughs)

00:34:43,321 --> 00:34:45,991
Just sit back
and enjoy the ride.

<i>Air One, this is Captain Brass.</i>

00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,301
Air One here.

00:34:56,301 --> 00:34:57,969
Do you have a visual?

00:34:57,969 --> 00:35:01,373
Affirmative. We're about
three miles behind him.

00:35:01,373 --> 00:35:03,909
Stay on radio frequency
tac three.

00:35:03,909 --> 00:35:06,478
In case he has his radio on,
we don't want to tip him off.

00:35:06,478 --> 00:35:08,146
Copy that.

00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:13,184
The green is Nick?

00:35:13,184 --> 00:35:15,654
Yeah. He and Brass
are on his tail.

00:35:24,996 --> 00:35:26,665
Air One at your six.

00:35:26,665 --> 00:35:29,167
All ground units be advised
your next is in 90.

00:35:29,167 --> 00:35:31,069
Hairpin right. Easy speed.

00:35:34,072 --> 00:35:35,240
What's happening?

00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:38,510
Nick, McKeen's vehicle
has stopped.

00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:39,878
Where is he?

00:35:39,878 --> 00:35:41,513
You should be right
on top of him.

00:35:41,513 --> 00:35:42,847
Either McKeen threw
his phone out

00:35:42,847 --> 00:35:44,816
or he pulled over.
He's just ahead of us.

00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,222
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:35:54,292 --> 00:35:55,627

00:36:09,441 --> 00:36:11,810
Nick... cover him.

00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:13,745
Control, this is Brass.

00:36:13,745 --> 00:36:17,916
One-David-Two's vehicle
has broke through a guardrail

00:36:17,916 --> 00:36:21,119
and gone into a gully
near mile marker 114.

00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:24,422
Send additional backup
and paramedics.

00:36:24,422 --> 00:36:26,625
Copy that. We'll notify backup
and EMS.

00:36:36,001 --> 00:36:38,303
Got a .357 magnum.

00:36:38,303 --> 00:36:40,405
McKeen carries a nine.

00:36:40,405 --> 00:36:42,574
Looks like Pritchard's
got a broken neck.

00:36:42,574 --> 00:36:44,476
No holes in him.

00:36:44,476 --> 00:36:46,111
(helicopter blades whirring)

00:36:48,346 --> 00:36:50,949
(grunting)

00:36:50,949 --> 00:36:52,784
Control, this is Brass.

00:36:52,784 --> 00:36:55,287
Pritchard is dead
and David-Two is on the run,

00:36:55,287 --> 00:36:57,923
armed and dangerous,
possibly injured.

00:36:57,923 --> 00:36:59,024
We're in pursuit.

00:36:59,024 --> 00:37:00,425
Copy that, Captain Brass.
Will advise.

00:37:02,494 --> 00:37:05,564
D2 is on the run.
D2 is on the run.

00:37:22,147 --> 00:37:24,249
Nick. Nick, this is Brass.
Come in.

00:37:24,249 --> 00:37:25,283
Go to channel three.

00:37:25,283 --> 00:37:27,953
Nick?

00:37:27,953 --> 00:37:29,955
(lowers volume):
We're on channel three.
You copy?

00:37:29,955 --> 00:37:31,957
(turns off radio)

00:37:43,201 --> 00:37:46,071

00:38:00,652 --> 00:38:03,655
Stokes, thank God you're here.

00:38:10,528 --> 00:38:12,197
I was trying
to bring Pritchard in.

00:38:12,197 --> 00:38:13,265
Shut up.

00:38:13,265 --> 00:38:15,166
He got
the drop on me.

00:38:15,166 --> 00:38:18,103
He grabbed my gun.
I lost control.

00:38:18,103 --> 00:38:20,572
I said shut up!

00:38:22,173 --> 00:38:24,309
Air One, Air One, come in.
This is Brass.

00:38:24,309 --> 00:38:26,244
Air One, Air One, do you copy?

00:38:26,244 --> 00:38:27,412
Air one here.

00:38:27,412 --> 00:38:28,847
There are four of us.
We spread out.

00:38:28,847 --> 00:38:31,349
We're all heading due west.
CSI Stokes is in the lead.

00:38:31,349 --> 00:38:33,318
We're looking for a visual
on McKeen.

00:38:33,318 --> 00:38:34,352
Can you verify?

00:38:34,352 --> 00:38:36,922
Stand by.

00:38:39,057 --> 00:38:41,860
Air One confirm visual.

00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:44,362
CSI Stokes has located
the suspect

00:38:44,362 --> 00:38:46,765
and has him at gunpoint 300
yards due west of your position.

00:38:46,765 --> 00:38:48,099
Copy that.

00:38:51,069 --> 00:38:53,371
Okay, you want to know
why I did it?

00:38:53,371 --> 00:38:55,607
Warrick had a big mouth,

00:38:55,607 --> 00:38:58,476
and I had to shut it.

00:38:58,476 --> 00:39:00,579
I tried to warn him,

00:39:00,579 --> 00:39:04,049
but he was just too stupid
to listen.

00:39:04,049 --> 00:39:06,751
(coughing)

00:39:06,751 --> 00:39:11,122
You know, when I shot him,
he had a big...

00:39:11,122 --> 00:39:14,092
smile on his face.

00:39:14,092 --> 00:39:17,862
I told him
he could keep his job.

00:39:17,862 --> 00:39:20,232
I didn't have
the heart to fire him.

00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:21,600
Shut up.

00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,968
(cries out in pain)

00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:28,440
He was your friend.

00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:31,409
What kind of friend are you?!

00:39:31,409 --> 00:39:34,412
Shoot me, you son of a bitch!

00:39:36,081 --> 00:39:38,083
(gunshot)

00:39:41,453 --> 00:39:43,321
(helicopter blades whirring)

00:39:46,925 --> 00:39:48,560
Nick?

00:39:57,302 --> 00:40:00,539
McKeen has a gunshot wound
to the stomach.
(coughs)

00:40:00,539 --> 00:40:02,607
He's lost a lot of blood.
We should get the medevac

00:40:02,607 --> 00:40:04,676
chopper here ASAP.

00:40:04,676 --> 00:40:06,811
What was that shot?

00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,448
A miss.

00:40:22,227 --> 00:40:23,995
Jeffrey McKeen,

00:40:23,995 --> 00:40:27,799
you're under arrest
for the murder of Warrick Brown.

00:40:30,569 --> 00:40:34,506
Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death,

00:40:34,506 --> 00:40:37,842
I will fear no evil
for thou art with me.

00:40:37,842 --> 00:40:41,780
Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me.

00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,381
Thou preparest a table
before me

00:40:43,381 --> 00:40:46,117
in the presence of mine enemies.

00:40:46,117 --> 00:40:48,687
Thou anointest my head with oil.

00:40:48,687 --> 00:40:51,323
My cup runneth over.

00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:54,025
Surely goodness and mercy
shall follow me

00:40:54,025 --> 00:40:56,528
all the days of my life,

00:40:56,528 --> 00:41:00,165
and I will dwell in the house
of the Lord forever.

00:41:00,165 --> 00:41:02,100
Amen.

00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,368
ALL:
Amen.

00:41:17,115 --> 00:41:19,985
As crime scene investigators,

00:41:19,985 --> 00:41:23,588
we meet people on the worst day
of their lives.

00:41:23,588 --> 00:41:27,726
They've just lost
a family member,

00:41:27,726 --> 00:41:32,631
somebody they loved,
often in a horrible way.

00:41:32,631 --> 00:41:39,004
A piece of their heart is gone
and will never be replaced.

00:41:39,004 --> 00:41:43,909
The phrase we're trained
to offer them,

00:41:43,909 --> 00:41:47,279
"I'm sorry for your loss,"

00:41:47,279 --> 00:41:51,182
as we know now,

00:41:51,182 --> 00:41:53,618
doesn't offer much.

00:41:55,787 --> 00:42:01,960
Warrick Brown was a young boy
when his parents passed away.

00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:04,362
Much too young to learn

00:42:04,362 --> 00:42:06,531
that life can be
so tragically short.

00:42:08,199 --> 00:42:13,104
But I think that it taught him
how precious life is,

00:42:13,104 --> 00:42:18,810
and so he lived his life
to the fullest each day

00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:21,947
as if it was his last day.

00:42:21,947 --> 00:42:26,985
I was with Warrick
on his last day.

00:42:26,985 --> 00:42:31,289
All the qualities that defined
him-- his tenaciousness,

00:42:31,289 --> 00:42:34,292
his deep sense of loyalty,

00:42:34,292 --> 00:42:38,163
his courage...

00:42:38,163 --> 00:42:42,667
to risk his life
for what he knew was right--

00:42:42,667 --> 00:42:47,305
all those traits were with him
on that last day.

00:42:47,305 --> 00:42:51,009
Just before he died...

00:42:51,009 --> 00:42:53,979
we were all having breakfast
together--

00:42:53,979 --> 00:42:56,514
our team...

00:42:58,783 --> 00:43:00,886
...his friends...

00:43:03,922 --> 00:43:05,190
...his family.

00:43:09,594 --> 00:43:14,099
And Warrick was...

00:43:14,099 --> 00:43:16,935
he was...

00:43:26,578 --> 00:43:29,214
I'm gonna miss him so much.
