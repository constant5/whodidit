00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,502
from a couple of
unsolved homicides.

00:13:23,568 --> 00:13:24,970
May I ask why?

00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:26,471
My research.

00:13:26,538 --> 00:13:28,307
May I ask
what subject?

00:13:28,373 --> 00:13:32,010
I don't have to tell you that;
you're not my adviser anymore.

00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:34,446
But I'll have you read it
as soon as it's done, I promise,

00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:37,816
if you promise to help me
get it published in <i>JFS.</i>

00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:40,819
I'll tell you that
once I've read it.

00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:42,254
But I'll see what I can do.

00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,189
I know a lot of people
in the morgue.

00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:46,158
WAITRESS:
What can I get you?

00:13:46,224 --> 00:13:48,093
I'll have a coffee.

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,494
LANGSTON:
<i>All of these women</i>

00:13:49,561 --> 00:13:52,464
were murdered
approximately 11 years ago--

00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:55,434
a dental hygienist,
a manicurist, both from LA,

00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,136
and a blackjack dealer
from Vegas.

00:13:58,203 --> 00:13:59,905
Yes, I remember this.

00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:01,873
Serial case.

00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:05,243
All Hispanic,
all physically similar.

00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:07,512
And every one with
a severed C3,

00:14:07,579 --> 00:14:09,014
four and five
vertebrae.

00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:10,549
The Southwest Stalker.

00:14:10,615 --> 00:14:12,484
The Feds ran a task force,
but abandoned it

00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:14,519
when the bodies
stopped turning up.

00:14:14,586 --> 00:14:17,622
But Sylvia doesn't
physically fit the profile.

00:14:17,689 --> 00:14:19,291
I think Sylvia was more
than a victim in this case.

00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:20,959
I think
she was investigating it,

00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:24,229
and she got too close
to the killer and ended up dead.

00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:26,798
We never found the purse
at the scene.

00:14:26,865 --> 00:14:29,101
Maybe the killer
got into her office,

00:14:29,167 --> 00:14:30,702
grabbed her research to

00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:32,337
cover his tracks.

00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:35,073
LANGSTON:
Any DNA from that
leather fragment?

00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,708
WILLOWS:
Sample's a mixture.

00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:38,110
Multiple contributors.

00:14:38,176 --> 00:14:39,845
Can't even run it
through CODIS.

00:14:39,911 --> 00:14:42,814
All the Hispanic vics had
traces of atropine, scopalamine

00:14:42,881 --> 00:14:44,549
and hyoscyamine
in their systems.

00:14:44,616 --> 00:14:45,951
Consistent with
plant-based hallucinogens.

00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:47,085
Yeah.

00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:48,286
<i>Genus datura.</i>

00:14:48,353 --> 00:14:49,621
That's nasty stuff.

00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:52,157
If ingested, the effects
can be stronger than LSD.

00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:53,325
Yeah.

00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,826
It was in Sylvia's system, too.

00:14:54,893 --> 00:14:57,496
And Hodges found traces
of powdered datura

00:14:57,562 --> 00:14:59,331
on the piece of leather
in her hand.

00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:02,601
Datura's an odd drug
to incapacitate a victim with.

00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:06,204
It's used in SanterÃ­a and vodun
rituals to speak with the dead.

00:15:06,271 --> 00:15:08,206
Where might someone
get their hands on it locally?

00:15:08,273 --> 00:15:09,741
I don't know,
but I'm sure Narco does.

00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:11,743
Thank you.

00:15:12,744 --> 00:15:14,746
(children shouting playfully)

00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,627
How many more of these
do we got to run down?

00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:30,295
Tired of Northtown already?

00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:31,897
(chuckles):
Yeah.

00:15:31,963 --> 00:15:34,099
Don't worry, Jim, Narco
only had half a dozen

00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,401
known datura dealers
on their books.

00:15:39,504 --> 00:15:42,341
(muffled Latin-flavored
percussive music playing)

00:15:42,407 --> 00:15:45,377
Las Vegas Police!

00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:05,497
(muffled percussive music
continues)

00:16:08,266 --> 00:16:09,835
Well, we don't have
a warrant, you know.

00:16:09,901 --> 00:16:11,103
I'll put some
surveillance on this.

00:16:11,169 --> 00:16:12,838
We'll see what
happens, okay?

00:16:12,904 --> 00:16:13,972
All right.

00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:15,507
(woman screaming in distance)

00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:17,476
What was that?
Wait a minute.

00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:24,316
Las Vegas Police!

Brown powder;

00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:10,222
that looks like datura.

00:18:10,288 --> 00:18:11,423
BRASS:
Yeah.

00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,458

00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:16,228
Okay, everybody,

00:18:16,294 --> 00:18:19,598

This is all the surveillance

00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:04,710
I got from the night
of the murder.

00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:05,911
All right, that's her

00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,846
in the parking lot
of the Golden Gate Hotel.

00:19:10,882 --> 00:19:12,184
Have you got
something else?

00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,252
Yeah, got her in a few
different places.

My goodness.

00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:23,295

Oh.

00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:28,333
That looks like her.
Freeze it.

00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,003
Go in tighter.

00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:32,704

00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:36,274

00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:41,413
Anything else?

00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,814
Yeah.

00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:45,884
I think I have her
over here.

00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:49,087
All right, here she comes.

00:19:49,154 --> 00:19:52,024
Here she comes.

00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:54,626
Good, good, freeze that.

00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,962
Okay, blow her up.

00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,031
No, no, tighter, tighter.

00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:03,068
That's about as much
as I can get.

00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:06,738
Can you back her up?

00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,684
Good. Now bring her
forward again.

00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:25,791
She came from there.

00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:26,858
Now, what is that?

00:20:28,593 --> 00:20:30,696
I don't know.

00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:32,931
There's not much
resolution.

00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:34,333
Blow it up again.

00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:37,836
Again.

00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:42,674

00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,676

00:24:58,826 --> 00:25:00,127
It was...

00:25:00,194 --> 00:25:05,099
Yes, there was a conviction,
but, uh, bum rap.

00:25:05,166 --> 00:25:07,902
What about the cocaine
conviction in 2005 in Nevada.

00:25:07,969 --> 00:25:10,204
Wrong place,
wrong time.

00:25:10,271 --> 00:25:12,139
We're going to give you
an opportunity

00:25:12,206 --> 00:25:14,508
to make
a really good decision.

00:25:14,575 --> 00:25:16,877
We need a sample
of your DNA.

00:25:16,944 --> 00:25:18,613
We're investigating a murder
of a young woman

00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:19,947
who was found
about three blocks from here.

00:25:20,014 --> 00:25:22,383
You have any
objections to that?

00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:26,253
DNA gets people in trouble
if it's mishandled.

00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,422
BRASS:
It also gets you
out of trouble.

00:25:28,489 --> 00:25:30,558
Really, I'm not too sure
about that, man.

00:25:30,625 --> 00:25:31,993
Hey, what have you
got to lose?

00:25:32,059 --> 00:25:33,527
Make a good decision.

00:25:33,594 --> 00:25:35,663
I'd rather not.

00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:37,898
I'd rather not.

00:25:37,965 --> 00:25:42,637
MAN:
<i>I started wrestling</i>
<i>in Mexico City because...</i>

00:25:42,703 --> 00:25:44,438
Mexico has this passion
for wrestling.

00:25:44,505 --> 00:25:47,708
And I grew up, you know,
watching wrestling,

00:25:47,775 --> 00:25:50,745
and finding all these <i>luchadores</i>
so extraordinary,

00:25:50,811 --> 00:25:52,980
so, uh, heroic.

00:25:53,047 --> 00:25:56,183
El Santo, Mil MÃ¡scaras,
Chivo Garcia, Blue Demon...

00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:57,485
Those were my idols.

00:25:57,551 --> 00:26:01,422
How did you end up in, uh,
Albuquerque, New Mexico?

00:26:01,489 --> 00:26:06,694
I think I remember about that,
and it's a thing

00:26:06,761 --> 00:26:09,030
that I'd like to forget
because it was a bum rap.

00:26:09,096 --> 00:26:11,832
You're convicted for rape
in Albuquerque.

00:26:11,899 --> 00:26:13,401
You're convicted for
attacking a police officer

00:26:13,467 --> 00:26:14,769
in Las Cruces,
New Mexico.

00:26:14,835 --> 00:26:15,937
I didn't get
represented properly.

00:26:16,003 --> 00:26:17,238
BRASS:
Okay.

00:26:17,305 --> 00:26:19,273
And I served a sentence
which I should not have served.

00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,608
Hey, listen, listen.
And the attorney

00:26:20,675 --> 00:26:22,176
did not do a good job.

00:26:22,243 --> 00:26:24,278
Jesus, we're not here
to bust you about that.

00:26:24,345 --> 00:26:26,180
What's your famous move, Jesus?

00:26:26,247 --> 00:26:28,215
My strong move is

00:26:28,282 --> 00:26:30,551
<i>"lava volcÃ¡n,"</i>

00:26:30,618 --> 00:26:32,887
which is
the lava of the volcano,

00:26:32,954 --> 00:26:35,022
which is a headlock.

00:26:35,089 --> 00:26:38,392
You hold it, put your hand here,

00:26:38,459 --> 00:26:41,762
hold the neck, and you squeeze!

00:26:41,829 --> 00:26:44,098
When you wear this mask...

00:26:44,165 --> 00:26:46,534
it also hides you
from other people, right?

00:26:46,601 --> 00:26:48,035
That's right.

00:26:48,102 --> 00:26:52,373
So, Volcan... people
wouldn't know who you were

00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,542
if you attacked them
wearing this mask.

00:27:01,148 --> 00:27:02,883
(Emcee shouting in Spanish)

00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:04,652
EMCEE:
<i>You know, I...</i>

00:27:04,719 --> 00:27:08,522
I have to tell you
that it, uh, it felt good

00:27:08,589 --> 00:27:11,158
to have a pretty,
young girl like that

00:27:11,225 --> 00:27:13,461
come, ask me questions.

00:27:14,462 --> 00:27:15,696
It took me back.

00:27:15,763 --> 00:27:17,498
It took me back
to the old days.

00:27:17,565 --> 00:27:19,867
You know,
when I was a... a champion.

00:27:19,934 --> 00:27:21,102
A real <i>campeÃ³n.</i>

00:27:21,168 --> 00:27:24,405
An old <i>luchador</i>
took me under his wing.

00:27:24,472 --> 00:27:26,274
He taught me everything.

00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,975
And then they gave me a chance,
they put me in there,

00:27:28,042 --> 00:27:30,745
you know, they put me in
there with an old <i>luchador.</i>

00:27:30,811 --> 00:27:32,146
They didn't think
I could do it.

00:27:32,213 --> 00:27:33,848
I surprise everybody.

00:27:33,914 --> 00:27:35,483
I put him down right away.

00:27:35,549 --> 00:27:38,019
What was the hold you used in,
uh... on your wife

00:27:38,085 --> 00:27:39,220
in Albuquerque, New Mexico,

00:27:39,287 --> 00:27:41,555
when you were arrested
for assault and battery?

00:27:41,622 --> 00:27:42,890
That was a misunderstanding.

00:27:42,957 --> 00:27:44,091
That-That... No, no, no, no.

00:27:44,158 --> 00:27:45,259
That was... That was a mistake.

00:27:45,326 --> 00:27:46,560
Does the record about
the assault and battery

00:27:46,627 --> 00:27:47,962
of the woman....
Yeah, it's
all here.

00:27:48,029 --> 00:27:50,798
...does it say in the record
that she attacked me first?

00:27:50,865 --> 00:27:53,200
Huh? Does it say there
that she cut up my face

00:27:53,267 --> 00:27:54,602
with a-with a broken bottle?

00:27:54,669 --> 00:27:57,905
Huh? Does it say that
the charges were dropped?

00:27:57,972 --> 00:28:00,875
They were, huh?
So you got lucky.

00:28:00,942 --> 00:28:02,743
Well, that's...
Huh?

00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:04,445
That's history now.

00:28:04,512 --> 00:28:06,747
She's married to another man
anyway. It's, uh...

00:28:06,814 --> 00:28:09,417
Yeah, aren't they all?
Aren't they all?

00:28:09,483 --> 00:28:11,218
You like to
beat up women?

00:28:11,285 --> 00:28:13,521
No. I like women.

00:28:13,587 --> 00:28:14,655
Women like me.

00:28:14,722 --> 00:28:15,923
How about this woman?

00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:18,392
You ever see her before?
Is this the one you

00:28:18,459 --> 00:28:19,994
were talking about earlier?

00:28:20,061 --> 00:28:21,596
Well...

00:28:21,662 --> 00:28:24,765
Yes, I, uh, I-I...

00:28:24,832 --> 00:28:27,268
Why? Why are you asking me
about her?

00:28:27,335 --> 00:28:28,769
Just look at her.

00:28:28,836 --> 00:28:31,806
You know, I...

00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:33,341
Oh, I remember now.

00:28:33,407 --> 00:28:35,810
Yeah, she was...
she was coming around,

00:28:35,876 --> 00:28:36,944
talking to the <i>luchadores.</i>

00:28:37,011 --> 00:28:38,045
What did she want?

00:28:40,481 --> 00:28:42,149
About the <i>lucha libre.</i>

00:28:42,216 --> 00:28:44,185
She was a fan.
That's what she said.

00:28:44,251 --> 00:28:46,754
She said she was investigating.
She said she wanted to...

00:28:46,821 --> 00:28:48,122
She was
investigating what?

00:28:48,189 --> 00:28:51,425
She was, uh... writing
some kind of... a paper.

00:28:51,492 --> 00:28:52,960
She was going to do a...

00:28:53,027 --> 00:28:55,162
write a story
about <i>lucha libre,</i> you know?

00:28:55,229 --> 00:28:56,497
That's it?

00:28:56,564 --> 00:28:58,599
Yeah. She was talking
to the <i>luchadores.</i>

00:28:58,666 --> 00:28:59,900
And, uh, she was hanging around.

00:28:59,967 --> 00:29:01,035
That's all.

00:29:01,102 --> 00:29:02,770
She ever mention
any other names to you?

00:29:02,837 --> 00:29:05,439
Names of-of what?
<i>Luchadores?</i>

00:29:05,506 --> 00:29:07,475
Women.
Women?

00:29:07,541 --> 00:29:08,809
Attractive women.

00:29:08,876 --> 00:29:10,044
Why would she

00:29:10,111 --> 00:29:11,946
be mentioning
attractive women to me?

00:29:12,013 --> 00:29:14,582
A, uh, Jessica Martinez?

00:29:14,649 --> 00:29:17,184
Who?
Jessica Martinez.

00:29:17,251 --> 00:29:20,254
Uh, no.
That's a very common name.

00:29:20,321 --> 00:29:22,056
No?
No.

00:29:22,123 --> 00:29:23,491
Uh, Elena Garcia?

00:29:23,557 --> 00:29:26,294
Elena Garcia? No,
I don't know any Elena Garcia.

00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:29,363
What about, um, Maria Perez?

00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,631
Maria Perez?
Think about it.
Think about it.

00:29:30,698 --> 00:29:32,166
What is it? What is it?
Just don't lie to me.

00:29:32,233 --> 00:29:33,334
What?
Just think about it.
Think about it.

00:29:33,401 --> 00:29:34,802
I'm not lying.

00:29:34,869 --> 00:29:38,706
So, you won't mind giving us
a sample of your DNA, then.

00:29:38,773 --> 00:29:41,542
Too many innocent people
have been sent to jail

00:29:41,609 --> 00:29:43,244
because of DNA.

00:29:43,311 --> 00:29:46,147
You guys, you think that the DNA
is everything now, huh?

00:29:46,213 --> 00:29:47,815
Everything is DNA. DNA.
No. No.

00:29:47,882 --> 00:29:49,984
Hey, it helps a lot of people
get out of jail, too.

00:29:50,051 --> 00:29:51,786
Look. It's a
very easy thing,

00:29:51,852 --> 00:29:54,088
the procedure, we just
swab a little cotton stick

00:29:54,155 --> 00:29:55,656
in your mouth,
get some DNA.

00:29:55,723 --> 00:29:57,592
We find out a little
bit more about you.

00:29:57,658 --> 00:29:58,893
That's very good.
What's behind the mask?

00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,994
Okay.
That's very good.

00:30:00,061 --> 00:30:01,429
It won't take long.

00:30:01,495 --> 00:30:04,198
You know, the last time... the
last time a cop said that to me,

00:30:04,265 --> 00:30:06,334
I did two weeks in County.

00:30:07,335 --> 00:30:09,303
LANGSTON:
Any of these wrestlers

00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:13,374
had the strength and the skill
to induce spinal shock, and...

00:30:13,441 --> 00:30:15,343
I think that that
leather fragment

00:30:15,409 --> 00:30:18,379
we found in Sylvia's hand
came from a <i>luchador's</i> mask.

00:30:18,446 --> 00:30:21,115
Well, if it did,
it was probably very old.

00:30:21,182 --> 00:30:24,752
The fragment was tanned
with oak, which is a process

00:30:24,819 --> 00:30:26,854
that fell out of use in Mexico
in the late '70s.

00:30:26,921 --> 00:30:29,590
Here, take a look
at this detail.

00:30:29,657 --> 00:30:33,761
That piece of leather appears
to be at least 50 years old.

00:30:40,334 --> 00:30:42,403

This one's just a copy.

00:31:58,746 --> 00:32:00,014
I got 20 of these.
You want me to

00:32:00,081 --> 00:32:01,582
get one for you?
I'll autograph one for you, man.

00:32:01,649 --> 00:32:05,019
I love <i>lucha libre,</i> man.
I love the, uh, the utter chaos

00:32:05,086 --> 00:32:08,556
when the... the bad
guys are beating up
the good guys, and the

00:32:08,623 --> 00:32:12,126
crowd's throwing
chicken bones and beer bottles

00:32:12,193 --> 00:32:15,696
in the ring, then the good guys
come back at the end.

00:32:15,763 --> 00:32:17,431
It's like, uh, in my sick head,

00:32:17,498 --> 00:32:20,034
it's like romantic poetry, man,
you know?

00:32:20,101 --> 00:32:22,203
What happened
last year in Phoenix?

00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:24,272
Couple, uh-- We were at a bar,

00:32:24,338 --> 00:32:27,608
couple guys started mouthing off
about how fake wrestling is.

00:32:27,675 --> 00:32:29,777
So all right, "Let's go
in the parking lot, man.

00:32:29,844 --> 00:32:31,345
We'll see how fake it is."

00:32:31,412 --> 00:32:33,681
Things got out of control,

00:32:33,748 --> 00:32:35,549
the wrestlers,
the wrestlers won that night.

00:32:35,616 --> 00:32:37,318
But I-I beat the charge,
you know.

00:32:37,385 --> 00:32:38,552
It was
attempted murder.

00:32:38,619 --> 00:32:41,455
I mean, I'd call that
getting way out of control.

00:32:41,522 --> 00:32:43,190
Yeah, it was attempted murder,
but like I said,

00:32:43,257 --> 00:32:44,525
there's no record.

00:32:44,592 --> 00:32:45,960
And what move are you known for?

00:32:46,027 --> 00:32:47,361
Ah, the finishing
move for Fantasmo.

00:32:47,428 --> 00:32:48,930
Ah, man, you'd love it.

00:32:48,996 --> 00:32:50,932
It's called
the Fantasmo Face-lift.

00:32:50,998 --> 00:32:52,233
Check it out.

00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,535
I get my right arm,
right, underneath the chin,

00:32:54,602 --> 00:32:57,038
then I get my left arm
right behind the neck. Okay?

00:32:57,104 --> 00:32:58,372
Then I push down.

00:32:58,439 --> 00:32:59,840
If I use enough force--

00:32:59,907 --> 00:33:01,409
see, I cut off the air supply--

00:33:01,475 --> 00:33:02,810
if I use enough force-- mm!--

00:33:02,877 --> 00:33:04,812
up with the face.

00:33:04,879 --> 00:33:06,280
(Sylvia screams, bone snaps)

00:33:06,347 --> 00:33:10,251
Jesus, would you mind giving us
a sample of your DNA?

00:33:10,318 --> 00:33:12,219
No.

00:33:12,286 --> 00:33:13,821
I didn't do nothing wrong.

00:33:13,888 --> 00:33:15,423
Do what you got to do, man.

00:33:15,489 --> 00:33:18,259
The unknown DNA sample on the
leather fragment was a mixture,

00:33:18,326 --> 00:33:20,728
but that fragment was
from Fantasmo's mask.

00:33:20,795 --> 00:33:23,030
So what I did was
subtract Fantasmo's DNA,

00:33:23,097 --> 00:33:25,399
I reran the whole
profile, and I got a hit.

00:33:30,771 --> 00:33:32,039
(beeping)

00:33:32,106 --> 00:33:33,608
He was actually in
the arrestee index.

00:33:33,674 --> 00:33:37,011
It was for a domestic violence
rap in New Mexico 12 years ago.

00:33:37,078 --> 00:33:38,546
Well, he's not
one of the wrestlers.

00:33:39,947 --> 00:33:41,916
He's the emcee.

00:33:41,983 --> 00:33:44,018
(crowd cheering in distance)

00:33:50,825 --> 00:33:52,827
(grunting)

00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:59,166
Couldn't this wait
till after the show?

00:33:59,233 --> 00:34:01,802
I got a really full house
to rev up for tonight.

00:34:01,869 --> 00:34:05,706
What are you doing
with my mask?

00:34:05,773 --> 00:34:07,875
What are you
talking about?

00:34:07,942 --> 00:34:09,677
This mask has been missing

00:34:09,744 --> 00:34:11,946
ever since
that girl got killed.

00:34:13,781 --> 00:34:16,484
And now I find it
in your bag.

00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:18,486
What are you saying?

00:34:18,552 --> 00:34:20,855
You think I had something
to do with that?

00:34:20,921 --> 00:34:23,424
I seen you with that girl
so many times,

00:34:23,491 --> 00:34:26,694
staring at her all weird,
the same way

00:34:26,761 --> 00:34:29,630
you used to stare at them
<i>chicas</i> down in Albuquerque...

00:34:29,697 --> 00:34:31,933
in LA.

00:34:31,999 --> 00:34:34,802
You don't know
what you're saying.

00:34:34,869 --> 00:34:36,370
I had nothing to do with that.

00:34:36,437 --> 00:34:38,706
You brought the heat down
on every one of us.

00:34:38,773 --> 00:34:40,441
The cops already think
we're a bunch of bangers

00:34:40,508 --> 00:34:42,643
and scumbags as it is.

00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:44,211
And now murderers, too?!

00:34:44,278 --> 00:34:45,680
'Varo, please.

00:34:45,746 --> 00:34:47,048
You got to believe me.

00:34:47,114 --> 00:34:49,617
Get the hell out
of my locker room.

00:34:49,684 --> 00:34:51,953
I swear to you...

00:34:52,019 --> 00:34:55,323
<i>Te lo juro</i>
<i>por mi madre.</i>

00:34:55,389 --> 00:34:57,858
I didn't do it.

00:34:57,925 --> 00:35:00,227
Go, now!

00:35:00,294 --> 00:35:02,229
You don't
belong here anymore.

00:35:02,296 --> 00:35:04,298
(crowd cheering in distance)

00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:21,582
(door opens)

00:35:23,284 --> 00:35:25,286
(door closes)

00:35:39,467 --> 00:35:41,469
(sighs)

00:36:02,523 --> 00:36:04,825
(crowd cheering and whistling)

00:36:06,594 --> 00:36:09,730
(water running)

00:36:11,866 --> 00:36:13,467
What?

00:36:15,202 --> 00:36:16,137
(low snarling)

00:36:16,203 --> 00:36:18,839
(cries out, groans)

00:36:20,808 --> 00:36:22,710
(cries out)

00:36:22,777 --> 00:36:25,713
(groans)

00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,782
(both grunting)

00:36:43,631 --> 00:36:45,633
(grunting)

00:36:50,538 --> 00:36:52,540
(gasping)

00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:58,012
(coughing)

00:37:00,548 --> 00:37:02,550
(groans)

00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,555
(crowd cheering in distance)

00:37:11,333 --> 00:37:14,303
(crowd cheering,
air horn blasts)

00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,942
(labored breathing)

00:37:25,114 --> 00:37:26,248
Don't do anything weird.

00:37:30,052 --> 00:37:31,720
(yells)

00:37:33,389 --> 00:37:35,391
(crowd cheering in distance)

00:37:38,761 --> 00:37:40,195
Boo!

00:37:40,262 --> 00:37:41,797
(crowd cheering and shouting)

00:37:47,603 --> 00:37:49,505
Yeah! Punch him!

00:37:49,571 --> 00:37:51,140
(cheering and shouting)

00:37:51,206 --> 00:37:54,209
(air horn blasts)

00:38:00,949 --> 00:38:02,918
(cheering and shouting)

00:38:02,985 --> 00:38:04,219
Hey!

00:38:04,286 --> 00:38:06,622
Hey, good!

00:38:06,689 --> 00:38:08,691
(cheering)

00:38:12,061 --> 00:38:14,063
(panting)

00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:20,936
BRASS:
Get your hands in the air!

00:38:21,003 --> 00:38:22,304
Get them up!

00:38:22,371 --> 00:38:23,472
You're all done.

00:38:23,539 --> 00:38:26,475
Get down
on your knees.

00:38:28,477 --> 00:38:29,678
Get down!

00:38:29,745 --> 00:38:32,348
(people murmuring)

00:38:32,414 --> 00:38:34,483
(handcuffs clicking)

00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:37,019
EMCEE:
I didn't do it.

00:38:37,086 --> 00:38:38,821
I'm innocent.

00:38:38,887 --> 00:38:40,789
I know what the parents
are going through.

00:38:40,856 --> 00:38:44,426
I... I wanted to help you guys.

00:38:44,493 --> 00:38:45,894
When you killed
Sylvia Mallick,

00:38:45,961 --> 00:38:48,030
you were wearing a mask.

00:38:48,097 --> 00:38:50,766
We have your DNA
on a piece of that mask.

00:38:50,833 --> 00:38:52,935
That's called
incriminating evidence.

00:38:53,002 --> 00:38:54,470
I-I didn't hurt anybody.

00:38:54,536 --> 00:38:56,572
BRASS:
You never hurt anybody?

00:38:56,638 --> 00:38:58,474
What about Jessica Martinez?
BRASS:
Yeah.

00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:59,842
I don't know
who that is.

00:38:59,908 --> 00:39:00,976
What about Elena Garcia?

00:39:01,043 --> 00:39:02,011
I-I don't...

00:39:02,077 --> 00:39:03,379
What about Maria Perez?

00:39:03,445 --> 00:39:04,780
I-I didn't hurt them.

00:39:04,847 --> 00:39:05,881
You didn't hurt these women?

00:39:05,948 --> 00:39:06,982
No.
I don't know who...

00:39:07,049 --> 00:39:08,450
You didn't murder these women?

00:39:08,517 --> 00:39:09,752
No, I did not
do this.

00:39:09,818 --> 00:39:11,086
You didn't murder
Sylvia Mallick?

00:39:11,153 --> 00:39:12,388
EMCEE:
No, I didn't. No!

00:39:12,454 --> 00:39:14,723
LANGSTON:
Then who did?

00:39:15,724 --> 00:39:18,894
BRASS:
Who did?

00:39:18,961 --> 00:39:21,563
(quietly):
It was Oggun.

00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:23,565
(low snarling)

00:39:23,632 --> 00:39:25,868
Oggun did it.

00:39:25,934 --> 00:39:29,104
Oggun is the god

00:39:29,171 --> 00:39:33,075
of violence and
brute force.

00:39:35,277 --> 00:39:37,312
Oggun.

00:39:37,379 --> 00:39:40,582
I tried to stop him.

00:39:40,649 --> 00:39:42,918
I tried
to reason with him.

00:39:42,985 --> 00:39:46,989
But Oggun would not listen.

00:39:47,056 --> 00:39:51,226
I begged him
not to hurt anyone else.

00:39:51,293 --> 00:39:52,127
(Sylvia screaming)

00:39:53,162 --> 00:39:57,499
I went to the priest.

00:39:57,566 --> 00:40:01,103
<i>But the priest</i>
<i>couldn't stop Oggun.</i>

00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:04,106
Oggun is the knife.

00:40:06,542 --> 00:40:07,509
Oggun needs sacrifice.

00:40:07,576 --> 00:40:10,279
Oggun didn't

00:40:10,346 --> 00:40:12,314
murder Sylvia Mallick, you did.

00:40:12,381 --> 00:40:13,549
Ray...
(screams)

00:40:13,615 --> 00:40:16,618
No evil spirit
murdered this woman.
We gotta...

00:40:16,685 --> 00:40:18,787
You did, because she was
going to reveal you

00:40:18,854 --> 00:40:21,156
as the murderer
you are!
Hey, hey, hey,
Ray. Ray.

00:40:21,223 --> 00:40:23,692
Take it easy, take it...
Ray, take it easy.

00:40:23,759 --> 00:40:25,961
(Emcee whimpers)

00:40:26,028 --> 00:40:29,832
(glass shattering, door slams)

00:40:29,898 --> 00:40:31,900
BRASS:
Ray!

00:40:39,274 --> 00:40:40,976
(slams door, glass clatters)

00:40:47,816 --> 00:40:49,885
SYLVIA (laughs):
<i>So you're gonna be a CSI?</i>

00:40:49,952 --> 00:40:51,086
LANGSTON:
<i>I am.</i>

00:40:51,153 --> 00:40:53,088
You'll be great at it.

00:40:54,356 --> 00:40:56,759
And so will
you one day.

00:40:56,825 --> 00:40:58,827
I think so.

00:41:01,096 --> 00:41:04,166
Well, I'm gonna hold you
to your promise.

00:41:04,233 --> 00:41:06,568
You better take my call.

00:41:06,635 --> 00:41:08,704
LANGSTON:
<i>You can count on it.</i>

00:41:56,485 --> 00:42:00,122
LANGSTON:
<i>I had a student</i>
<i>who wanted to be published.</i>

00:42:00,189 --> 00:42:02,358
<i>These would've been her words.</i>

00:42:02,424 --> 00:42:05,894
SYLVIA:
<i>I dedicate each chapter</i>
<i>to the unsolved cold cases</i>

00:42:05,961 --> 00:42:08,464
<i>LVPD has deemed related</i>

00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:11,934
<i>by evidence</i>
<i>or method of killing.</i>

00:42:12,001 --> 00:42:15,004
<i>Hopefully,</i>
<i>by the time I'm done,</i>

00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:19,408
<i>we will have a better idea why</i>
<i>these serial killers got away</i>

00:42:22,277 --> 00:42:27,950
<i>I intend to write in detail</i>
<i>about the ones who did not.</i>
