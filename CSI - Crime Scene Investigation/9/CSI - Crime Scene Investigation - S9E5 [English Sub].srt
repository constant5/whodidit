00:02:33,735 --> 00:02:35,069

on a hit-and-run.


00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,616
Tissue was white,
so, no blood flow.


00:04:21,683 --> 00:04:23,018
Means, what
happened


00:04:23,084 --> 00:04:25,253
to the face happened postmortem.


00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,090
I can see his brains
through his nasal cavities.


00:04:28,156 --> 00:04:30,625
That's cool.


00:04:30,692 --> 00:04:33,462
Well, B.R.B.-- be right back.


00:04:33,528 --> 00:04:36,565

No, that's it, Jim. Thanks.


00:04:57,018 --> 00:05:00,555
Rope marks on the upper
and lower torso,


00:05:00,622 --> 00:05:02,257
but no bruising.


00:05:02,324 --> 00:05:04,159
Postmortem.


00:05:04,226 --> 00:05:06,728
So are the stab wounds.


00:05:06,795 --> 00:05:08,597
Nipples are swollen.


00:05:08,663 --> 00:05:10,499
And it looks
like puncture wounds


00:05:10,565 --> 00:05:12,968
around the areola.


00:05:13,034 --> 00:05:15,070
If it was tattooing,
there'd be ink.


00:05:15,137 --> 00:05:17,072
Piercing, there'd be metal.


00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:18,874
I don't know, man.


00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:21,309
A kinky way to shoot up drugs?


00:05:22,911 --> 00:05:25,547
I'll have Robbins
work up a histo.


00:05:42,264 --> 00:05:45,534
Eight and three quarter-inch
tread width.


00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,870
So, that's consistent
with a small truck or SUV.


00:05:48,937 --> 00:05:52,040
Boy, there must be a
lot of clay in this soil.


00:05:52,107 --> 00:05:54,709
Otherwise, this track
would have totally washed away.


00:05:56,144 --> 00:05:58,146
My shoes are ruined.


00:05:58,213 --> 00:06:00,348
Why didn't you tell me
to wear boots?


00:06:00,415 --> 00:06:03,185
Or, better yet,
hire some more CSIs.


00:06:03,251 --> 00:06:05,954
Trust me,
you were my last choice.

00:06:06,021 --> 00:06:07,856
Thank you.

00:06:23,405 --> 00:06:25,340
Ow! <i>Ow!</i>

00:06:25,407 --> 00:06:28,710
(gasps)
Catherine, man down!

00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,648
Found a rope.


00:06:33,715 --> 00:06:34,916
Got a splinter.


00:06:34,983 --> 00:06:37,052
Think I pierced


00:06:37,119 --> 00:06:38,120
an artery.


00:06:44,526 --> 00:06:46,495
Blood.


00:06:46,561 --> 00:06:49,765
Nylon rope.


00:06:49,831 --> 00:06:55,670
Must have been used to tie
the body to the undercarriage.


00:06:55,737 --> 00:06:57,172
When the rope melted,


00:06:57,239 --> 00:06:59,174
body dropped onto the road.


00:06:59,241 --> 00:07:00,809
So, killer's
driving along,


00:07:00,876 --> 00:07:02,911
loses his cargo,


00:07:02,978 --> 00:07:05,147
pulls over,


00:07:05,213 --> 00:07:08,150
and drags the body
out into the desert.


00:07:08,216 --> 00:07:09,751
Had to have been an
accidental body dump.


00:07:09,818 --> 00:07:11,787
Why go to the trouble
to tie it up


00:07:11,853 --> 00:07:13,388
under the car
in the first place?


00:07:13,455 --> 00:07:14,890
Because if a cop stops you,


00:07:14,956 --> 00:07:18,059
they're going to look inside
the car, not underneath it.


00:07:26,368 --> 00:07:29,137
BRASS:
Let me take a walk through.
Hang back a second.


00:07:40,382 --> 00:07:41,383
BRASS:

00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:45,153
No sign of forced entry.


00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,022
Apart from us.


00:07:48,356 --> 00:07:49,858
Why don't you take this?


00:07:49,925 --> 00:07:51,660
I'll check the back.


00:08:11,713 --> 00:08:13,682
Well, I got an I.D.

00:08:13,748 --> 00:08:16,118
Ian Wallace was
a good-looking kid.

00:08:16,184 --> 00:08:18,987
Smells like citrus.

00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:51,586
Got a blood drop
with an air bubble.

00:08:54,456 --> 00:08:56,725
Got to be saliva.

00:08:56,792 --> 00:08:59,327
Hey, somebody got punched.

00:09:03,732 --> 00:09:06,468
Found more blood.

00:09:06,535 --> 00:09:08,336

For what's it worth,
I don't think

00:09:16,445 --> 00:09:18,013
he was injecting
weed or beer

00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,748
into his nipples.

00:09:19,815 --> 00:09:22,818
Although, this one time,
Hodges and I were growing botox,

00:09:22,884 --> 00:09:24,519
and he goes, and he injects it.

00:09:24,586 --> 00:09:27,722
It's okay, Henry. I don't
need to know any more.

00:09:27,789 --> 00:09:30,892

00:09:36,398 --> 00:09:40,235
Hello from below the equator

00:09:40,302 --> 00:09:42,237
We've been at sea
over a month now.

00:09:42,304 --> 00:09:44,573
You wouldn't believe the crew.

I wish that

00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:01,923
but, uh, this is the best
that I can do.

00:10:04,092 --> 00:10:06,194
I want to apologize
for being out of touch.

00:10:06,261 --> 00:10:11,032
I have been thinking

00:10:13,935 --> 00:10:16,104

Other spot's empty.

00:10:38,994 --> 00:10:41,696
I did find some fresh oil stains
and rope burns, though.

00:10:41,763 --> 00:10:42,864
Mm-hmm.

00:10:42,931 --> 00:10:44,032

the killer

00:10:44,099 --> 00:10:45,801
probably pulled his truck
into the garage.

00:10:45,867 --> 00:10:48,804

00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:49,971
Back door's unlocked.

00:10:50,038 --> 00:10:51,540

00:10:51,606 --> 00:10:53,475

I don't see a purse
around here.

00:11:03,318 --> 00:11:05,153

00:12:06,615 --> 00:12:07,949
Have you ever seen this?

00:12:08,016 --> 00:12:09,351
Never.

00:12:09,417 --> 00:12:10,786
Or this.

00:12:10,852 --> 00:12:12,254
What appear
to be minor burn marks

00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,555
on the upper and lower surfaces

00:12:13,622 --> 00:12:14,990
of the tongue.

00:12:15,056 --> 00:12:17,192
There are no other burn marks
in the oral cavity.

00:12:17,259 --> 00:12:19,694
Histo confirmed the burns
were electrical.

00:12:19,761 --> 00:12:20,996
They grilled his tongue?

00:12:21,062 --> 00:12:22,030
That's sick.

00:12:22,097 --> 00:12:23,298
Torture.
That would be

00:12:23,365 --> 00:12:24,766
my opinion at this time.

00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:25,901
COD?

00:12:25,967 --> 00:12:27,202
Manual asphyxia.

00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:28,570
Bruising around
the trachea.

00:12:28,637 --> 00:12:29,938
Broken hyoid bone.

00:12:30,005 --> 00:12:31,807
Killer strangled him
with his bare hands.

00:12:33,475 --> 00:12:36,278
GRISSOM:
So, Ian Wallace was restrained,

00:12:36,344 --> 00:12:38,413
his nipples were stimulated,

00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,415
he had minor burns
on his tongue,

00:12:40,482 --> 00:12:43,685
and he was asphyxiated.

00:12:43,752 --> 00:12:44,886
S and M?

00:12:44,953 --> 00:12:46,321
Gone very, very wrong.

00:12:46,388 --> 00:12:47,589
These stab wounds

00:12:47,656 --> 00:12:50,425
are brutal, random
and postmortem.

00:12:50,492 --> 00:12:52,561
Which is inconsistent
with S and M.

00:12:52,627 --> 00:12:54,596
Well, it's hard to take pleasure
in someone's pain

00:12:54,663 --> 00:12:56,198
once they're dead.

00:12:56,264 --> 00:12:58,166
Which is the
"gone wrong" part.

00:13:05,507 --> 00:13:07,609
You're a doctor--
is that normal?

00:13:07,676 --> 00:13:09,144
Grissom being socially awkward?

00:13:09,211 --> 00:13:10,679
Yeah, that's normal.

00:13:10,745 --> 00:13:12,814
He won't talk to me.

00:13:12,881 --> 00:13:15,517
And he doesn't appear
to be sleeping much.

00:13:36,004 --> 00:13:37,906
(knocking)

00:13:49,417 --> 00:13:51,153
Grissom.

00:13:53,388 --> 00:13:56,191
What are you doing here?

00:13:56,258 --> 00:13:58,026
I should have called.
I'm sorry.

00:13:58,093 --> 00:14:00,595
(thunder rumbling)
I... I didn't know
I was coming.

00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:04,065
What do you want?

00:14:13,511 --> 00:14:16,213
Thank you.

00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:21,685
When was the last time
you had a good night's sleep?

00:14:21,752 --> 00:14:24,755
Bad dreams.

00:14:26,023 --> 00:14:28,392
How can I help?

00:14:28,459 --> 00:14:33,064
I, uh... have a body
with S and M type wounds,

00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:36,767
but there are inconsistencies.

00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:40,104
So I was hoping to get
your first impressions.

00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:44,475
My first impression...
is that you've changed.

00:14:44,542 --> 00:14:47,244
Come on.

00:14:47,311 --> 00:14:49,513
How have you been?

00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:53,684
I got my Masters
in psychology last year.

00:14:53,751 --> 00:14:55,820
I'm a licensed therapist.

00:14:55,886 --> 00:14:58,522
I now have patients,
not clients.

00:14:58,589 --> 00:15:02,426
Let me guess-- you specialize
in sex therapy?

00:15:02,493 --> 00:15:05,930
LADY HEATHER:
These wounds around his nipples
are from needle play.

00:15:05,996 --> 00:15:07,965
The arrangement
is called "stacking."

00:15:09,734 --> 00:15:11,102
May I touch you?

00:15:13,504 --> 00:15:17,441
Needles are inserted
transversely and sagittally,

00:15:17,508 --> 00:15:19,910
which raises
the nipple upward.

00:15:19,977 --> 00:15:22,780
This causes the nipple to swell
and become highly sensitive.

00:15:22,847 --> 00:15:24,615
Which creates a "pain" button.

00:15:24,682 --> 00:15:27,284
Any touch or pressure
overwhelms the senses

00:15:27,351 --> 00:15:29,987
and releases a flood
of endorphins.

00:15:31,856 --> 00:15:34,125
So, uh...

00:15:34,191 --> 00:15:38,829
our victim is a submissive
who enjoyed pain.

00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:42,366
He also had electrical
burns on his tongue.

00:15:43,934 --> 00:15:45,636
Now I'm familiar

00:15:45,703 --> 00:15:47,405
with the use of gags in S and M.

00:15:47,471 --> 00:15:48,639
And some are metal.

00:15:48,706 --> 00:15:51,275
Did you ever use electricity?

00:15:51,342 --> 00:15:54,779
I never used electricity
above the waist.

00:15:54,845 --> 00:15:58,149
It only takes six milliamps
to stop the heart.

00:15:58,215 --> 00:16:00,084
It's too dangerous.

00:16:00,151 --> 00:16:01,218
This is tongue bondage.

00:16:01,285 --> 00:16:03,387
It's used in medical
exam fantasies

00:16:03,454 --> 00:16:05,156
as part of humiliation.

00:16:05,222 --> 00:16:07,224
<i>You ask the "patient"</i>
<i>to stick out their tongue,</i>

00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:08,959
<i>grab the tongue with</i>
<i>chopsticks, rubber band them</i>

00:16:09,026 --> 00:16:10,227
<i>to create a dental gag.</i>

00:16:10,294 --> 00:16:13,130
In a typical situation, one
would use wood chopsticks,

00:16:13,197 --> 00:16:16,233
which would leave some bruising
and if you're lucky, splinters.

00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:19,437
In this case, metal chopsticks
may have been used

00:16:19,503 --> 00:16:21,972
and electricity applied.

00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:24,975
These are masochistic
injuries.

00:16:25,042 --> 00:16:27,344
So we're looking
for a dominant?

00:16:27,411 --> 00:16:29,447
Mm-hmm.

00:16:29,513 --> 00:16:31,315
He lived with a woman.

00:16:31,382 --> 00:16:33,250
Was she into the lifestyle?
We don't know.

00:16:33,317 --> 00:16:34,819
She's missing.

00:16:34,885 --> 00:16:38,789
I'd like to see
photos of their bedroom.

00:16:38,856 --> 00:16:41,659
<i>Sometimes it's obvious.</i>

00:16:41,726 --> 00:16:44,028
<i>Sometimes it's not.</i>

00:16:44,095 --> 00:16:46,664
All right, copy that.

00:16:46,731 --> 00:16:50,801
I'll efax you the over-alls
if we find anything.

00:16:50,868 --> 00:16:52,870
Okay.

00:16:52,937 --> 00:16:56,907
Grissom wants us to look
for any S and M paraphernalia.

00:16:56,974 --> 00:17:00,845
I once had an old lady
in her 70's--

00:17:00,911 --> 00:17:02,113
burglary victim.

00:17:02,179 --> 00:17:03,948
Had to process her vibrators.

00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:07,118
Some of them were burned out.

00:17:07,184 --> 00:17:09,620
Why would you process
her... tuning forks?

00:17:09,687 --> 00:17:12,423
I'm thorough.

00:17:23,968 --> 00:17:26,237
I got a booty smudge
on the TV.

00:17:31,108 --> 00:17:34,111
Justine super-sized herself.

00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,080
Double-D implants.

00:17:36,147 --> 00:17:37,748
Welcome to Vegas.

00:17:45,289 --> 00:17:47,758
SANDERS:
Positive for semen.

00:18:02,807 --> 00:18:07,378
What does it say about me
that I always find the smut?

00:18:07,445 --> 00:18:09,013
That you're lucky.

00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:15,086
Guess they were
into S and M.

00:18:23,461 --> 00:18:24,695
You ever been tied up?

00:18:24,762 --> 00:18:26,530
What do you think?

00:18:26,597 --> 00:18:28,566
I think you're more
into hair pulling.

00:18:28,632 --> 00:18:29,633
STOKES:
Hey...

00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,935
knock it off.

00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:34,405
Get me some pictures
of that stuff, will ya?

00:18:38,309 --> 00:18:40,211
Got a bloody shirt
in a laundry basket.

00:18:44,782 --> 00:18:46,817
Bloodstains match

00:18:46,884 --> 00:18:50,221
the puncture marks
on Ian's pecs.

00:18:50,287 --> 00:18:52,490
Which means he must have
changed his shirt

00:18:52,556 --> 00:18:55,326
after the nipple action,
but before he was killed.

00:18:55,393 --> 00:18:57,561
Girlfriend could've
redressed him,

00:18:57,628 --> 00:18:59,697
tossed the shirt
in the basket out of habit.

00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:01,465
Yeah, and then what?

00:19:01,532 --> 00:19:04,402
Little Justine ties 200 pounds
of dead weight

00:19:04,468 --> 00:19:05,936
up under her SUV?

00:19:06,003 --> 00:19:07,071
Well, I could do it.

00:19:07,138 --> 00:19:08,539
It's just physics and leverage.

00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:11,776
Takes brains
not brawn.
I don't think you could.

00:19:11,842 --> 00:19:13,511
I think you could do it.

00:19:13,577 --> 00:19:15,613
The killing part, too.

00:19:21,085 --> 00:19:23,587
The trunk contains
male slave gear.

00:19:25,523 --> 00:19:29,260
Needle and electro play requires
special equipment.

00:19:29,326 --> 00:19:32,396
I don't see any
dedicated S and M room.

00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:34,565
So he didn't play at home.

00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:37,668
Do you think he went
to a professional?

00:19:41,272 --> 00:19:43,374
Lower Linx is part
of the amateur scene.

00:19:43,441 --> 00:19:46,143
It has a well-equipped
back room.

00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:47,745

00:22:12,976 --> 00:22:14,211
Sex.

00:22:14,278 --> 00:22:16,780
That love juice
from near the TV

00:22:16,847 --> 00:22:20,417
was a mixture of seminal fluid
and vaginal secretions.

00:22:20,484 --> 00:22:21,885
Ian and his girlfriend?

00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:23,387
Well, yes on him,

00:22:23,454 --> 00:22:24,756
but assuming that that was
her toothbrush you gave me,

00:22:24,756 --> 00:22:25,824
definitely no on her.

with some hood rat in their
bedroom and kills him.

Yeah... I found more.

00:22:34,365 --> 00:22:36,901
It's on the shirt
that you gave me

00:22:36,968 --> 00:22:39,370
from Ian Wallace's
laundry basket.

00:22:41,439 --> 00:22:43,608
High-velocity

Our victim wasn't shot.

00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:47,212
No, but sometimes
expiratory blood

00:22:47,278 --> 00:22:49,748
can actually mimic
high-velocity gunshot spatter.

00:22:53,218 --> 00:22:55,787
It's on the back
of the shoulder.

00:22:55,854 --> 00:22:57,922
It's probably
not his.

00:22:57,989 --> 00:23:00,492
Maybe he's got the killer
on his back.

00:23:00,558 --> 00:23:05,463

I think you were right.

00:23:10,468 --> 00:23:14,038
If a relationship
can't move forward,

00:23:14,105 --> 00:23:15,707
it withers.

00:23:17,742 --> 00:23:20,311
LADY HEATHER:
There's a schism
between the lovers.

00:23:20,378 --> 00:23:23,748
Ian and Justine have
different priorities,

00:23:23,815 --> 00:23:26,951
different roles.

00:23:27,018 --> 00:23:29,487
She's the keeper

00:23:29,554 --> 00:23:31,156
traditional.

00:23:31,222 --> 00:23:33,691
Mass card and rosary
in her nightstand.

00:23:33,758 --> 00:23:36,327
A good girl,
afraid of the dark.

00:23:36,394 --> 00:23:38,997
What about him?

00:23:39,063 --> 00:23:42,167
Ian liked to
compartmentalize.

00:23:42,233 --> 00:23:43,835
It made him feel safe.

00:23:43,902 --> 00:23:45,236
Everything had
its place.

00:23:45,303 --> 00:23:47,338
Work, her, sports.

00:23:47,405 --> 00:23:49,207
He kept his dark side
locked in a trunk,

00:23:49,274 --> 00:23:51,876
hidden away from her.

00:23:53,545 --> 00:23:56,147
Does Sara know you're here?

00:23:56,214 --> 00:23:59,084
No.

00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:01,653
Am I your secret?

00:24:01,719 --> 00:24:06,224
No, and you're
not my therapist.

00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:14,365
They found some evidence

00:24:14,432 --> 00:24:18,436
that Ian may have had sex with
another woman in their house.

00:24:18,503 --> 00:24:21,473
That's his subconscious desire
to be caught and punished,

00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:23,341
which is why he chose
Justine as a partner.

00:24:23,408 --> 00:24:27,345
He's got a mommy
to hide things from.

00:24:27,412 --> 00:24:29,581
The Virgin Mother.

00:24:29,647 --> 00:24:32,016
Justine is
an enabler,

00:24:32,083 --> 00:24:34,152
not a dominant.

00:24:34,219 --> 00:24:35,720
Even if she discovered
his infidelities,

00:24:35,787 --> 00:24:37,088
she couldn't harm him.

00:24:37,155 --> 00:24:40,091
She's not your killer.

00:24:44,195 --> 00:24:47,766
BRASS:
The Boulder City cop was able
to run the burnt license plate.

00:24:47,832 --> 00:24:51,202
The registered owner is
Justine Stefani.

00:24:51,269 --> 00:24:53,605
I'm guessing we're
about 20 miles southeast

00:24:53,671 --> 00:24:55,173
of the original crime scene.

00:24:59,744 --> 00:25:01,112
Those are breast implants.

00:25:01,179 --> 00:25:05,116
Unlike most plastic, silicone
is extremely heat resistant.

00:25:05,183 --> 00:25:06,751
Justine Stefani had fake boobs.

00:25:06,818 --> 00:25:08,486
I saw a photo of her.

00:25:08,553 --> 00:25:09,721
Doc Robbins will be able

00:25:09,788 --> 00:25:11,456
to match the serial numbers
of those implants

00:25:11,523 --> 00:25:12,924
and confirm
her identity.

00:25:12,991 --> 00:25:16,528
Which means our suspect
is now a victim.

00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,543
Serial numbers
from the breast
implants confirm

00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:28,112
the victim is
Justine Stefani.

00:25:28,179 --> 00:25:30,014
Dave, do you want
to flip her over?

00:25:33,851 --> 00:25:38,590
Third-degree burns
over 75% of her body.

00:25:38,656 --> 00:25:40,491
Doc, take a look.

00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:42,627
ROBBINS:
The victim's arms
were bound.

00:25:42,694 --> 00:25:45,897
Ligature marks are ante-mortem.

00:25:45,964 --> 00:25:51,135
WILLOWS:
<i>Found a set of shoe impressions</i>
<i>heading away from the highway.</i>

00:25:52,437 --> 00:25:55,139
<i>Tire impressions followed them.</i>

00:26:00,812 --> 00:26:04,816
SANDERS:
<i>Found Justine's boots</i>
<i>under the vehicle.</i>

00:26:10,588 --> 00:26:13,925
ROBBINS:
<i>C.O.D. was multiple traumatic</i>
<i>injuries-- homicide.</i>

00:26:13,992 --> 00:26:17,896
<i>Compound fractures to both</i>
<i>femurs indicate impact</i>

00:26:17,962 --> 00:26:19,330
<i>back to front.</i>

00:26:19,397 --> 00:26:22,166
<i>Fractures are inconsistent</i>
<i>with passenger injuries,</i>

00:26:22,233 --> 00:26:24,335
<i>but consistent</i>
<i>with a pedestrian</i>

00:26:24,402 --> 00:26:26,271
<i>being hit by a vehicle.</i>

00:26:29,507 --> 00:26:33,011
STOKES:
<i>Found a clump of Justine's hair</i>
<i>on the skid plate.</i>

00:26:33,077 --> 00:26:37,048
<i>She was ultimately killed</i>
<i>by her own SUV.</i>

00:26:38,816 --> 00:26:43,354
<i>Axle was cracked,</i>
<i>making the vehicle undriveable,</i>

00:26:43,421 --> 00:26:47,292
<i>which is probably</i>
<i>why the killer torched it.</i>

00:26:47,358 --> 00:26:49,794
SANDERS:
<i>A second set of impressions</i>
<i>were consistent</i>

00:26:49,861 --> 00:26:52,196
<i>with a size nine athletic shoe.</i>

00:26:52,263 --> 00:26:53,731
<i>The footwear trail ended</i>

00:26:53,798 --> 00:26:56,968
<i>at a separate set of tire</i>
<i>impressions just off the road.</i>

00:26:57,035 --> 00:27:00,371
<i>The killer may have flagged</i>
<i>down a passing motorist</i>

00:27:00,438 --> 00:27:02,073
<i>or had an accomplice.</i>

00:27:03,908 --> 00:27:05,476
WILLOWS:
<i>So we have two new suspects.</i>

00:27:05,543 --> 00:27:09,013
One of whom wears
a size nine shoe,

00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,449
which is the equivalent
of a woman's size 11.

00:27:11,516 --> 00:27:13,851
The other suspect
drives a vehicle

00:27:13,918 --> 00:27:15,353
with two different
brands of tires.

00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:19,724
Front were Pirelli P-235
70R 15s.

00:27:19,791 --> 00:27:21,793
Rear were same size Michelin.

00:27:21,859 --> 00:27:23,461
Can't narrow it down.

00:27:23,528 --> 00:27:26,831
We know that Ian was
killed at the house

00:27:26,898 --> 00:27:28,833
and transported
in Justine's car,

00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:32,337
so Justine had to have been
kidnapped from the house.

00:27:32,403 --> 00:27:34,806
So whatever started
at the Lower Linx

00:27:34,872 --> 00:27:36,407
ended at their house.

00:27:36,474 --> 00:27:39,043
She must have walked in on it.

00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:40,778
Why not just kill her there?

00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,083
I mean, if you take
a live female victim,

00:27:45,149 --> 00:27:46,317
there's a reason.

00:27:46,384 --> 00:27:49,454
You want to take
your time with her.

00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:53,324
I did collect
these metal chopsticks

00:27:53,391 --> 00:27:54,859
from the Lower Linx.

00:27:54,926 --> 00:27:56,427
They're used
in tongue bondage.

00:27:56,494 --> 00:28:01,900
Now, the center saliva DNA
is a match to Ian Wallace,

00:28:01,966 --> 00:28:04,302
but on the ends,
the epithelial DNA,

00:28:04,369 --> 00:28:06,204
unknown female.

00:28:06,271 --> 00:28:08,406
It did, however, match
the DNA profile

00:28:08,473 --> 00:28:10,775
from the vaginal secretions
at the house.

00:28:10,842 --> 00:28:12,944
So Ian was sleeping
with his dom.

00:28:13,011 --> 00:28:15,813
You know, I got
a real dominatrix vibe

00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,982
from Miss Tournay.

00:28:18,049 --> 00:28:21,286
Her and Lady Heather
could be sisters.

00:28:21,352 --> 00:28:23,021
Who's Lady Heather?

00:28:23,087 --> 00:28:26,324
Oh, that's a whole other <i>Oprah.</i>

00:28:26,391 --> 00:28:27,659
Changing the channel,

00:28:27,725 --> 00:28:31,930
do we have enough to get
a warrant for Ms. Tournay's DNA?

00:28:31,996 --> 00:28:34,265
Yeah, I think so.
I'll talk to the DA.

00:28:34,332 --> 00:28:36,935
Oh, we also might have a lead
on the other suspect.

00:28:37,001 --> 00:28:38,770
I ran Justine's phone records.

00:28:38,836 --> 00:28:44,342
Last incoming call was from
a Martin Devlin at 8:12 P.M.

00:28:44,409 --> 00:28:47,278
I have tremendous respect
for law enforcement.

00:28:47,345 --> 00:28:49,447
Risking your lives every day

00:28:49,514 --> 00:28:50,748
for so little reward.

00:28:50,815 --> 00:28:53,885
How'd you get Justine Stefani's
phone number?

00:28:53,952 --> 00:28:57,188
Got it off a warm call list.

00:28:57,255 --> 00:28:59,991
She was a Web site
surfer, Jim.

00:29:00,058 --> 00:29:01,392
Left her contact info.

00:29:01,459 --> 00:29:02,727
What'd you two talk about?

00:29:02,794 --> 00:29:04,862
Life insurance,
term for her

00:29:04,929 --> 00:29:06,264
and her soon-to-be
fiancÃ©.

00:29:06,331 --> 00:29:07,298
She was a planner.

00:29:07,365 --> 00:29:08,700
Did you talk to the boyfriend?

00:29:08,766 --> 00:29:10,635
Only her, Jim.

00:29:10,702 --> 00:29:12,070
You ever been to their house?

00:29:12,136 --> 00:29:14,239
No, it was one
phone call.

00:29:14,305 --> 00:29:16,341
Chatted her up
and talked some turkey.

00:29:16,407 --> 00:29:18,076
Oh, did you close her
on the insurance?

00:29:18,142 --> 00:29:21,579
I had her going, then out
of the blue, she hangs up.

00:29:21,646 --> 00:29:22,580
Oh.

00:29:22,647 --> 00:29:24,616
Yeah, I lost that fish.

00:29:24,682 --> 00:29:27,452
Sorry I can't be
of more help, Jim. I...

00:29:27,518 --> 00:29:29,587
But meeting me
could be the best thing

00:29:29,654 --> 00:29:30,889
that ever happened to you.

00:29:30,955 --> 00:29:32,724
Oh, yeah?

00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:34,692
You see, most cops
are under-insured.

00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:36,828
And it's your family
that'll suffer.

00:29:36,895 --> 00:29:38,663
I can hook you up
with catastrophic life,

00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:40,031
an umbrella policy
and car insurance

00:29:40,098 --> 00:29:41,332
in less
than ten minutes

00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:42,400
and it'll save
you money.

00:29:42,467 --> 00:29:43,501
Thanks. I'm all set. Thanks.

00:29:43,568 --> 00:29:45,336
In the heterosexual world,

00:29:45,403 --> 00:29:47,305
men want to be
dominated by women.

00:29:47,372 --> 00:29:48,573
and women by men.

00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,842
So Wallace would have had
a female dominant.

00:29:50,909 --> 00:29:53,244
Well, we've confirmed that
through physical evidence.

00:29:53,311 --> 00:29:54,746
She also slept
with him.

00:29:54,812 --> 00:29:57,715
Which is why one should
always go to a professional.

00:29:57,782 --> 00:29:59,083
They know
the boundaries.

00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:01,419
I feel the same way
about crime scene investigators.

00:30:01,486 --> 00:30:03,521
And no one has more rigid
boundaries than you.

00:30:03,588 --> 00:30:07,525
We know there was
at least one killer,

00:30:07,592 --> 00:30:08,960
but there may
have been two.

00:30:09,027 --> 00:30:11,529
But we don't know if it
was a man or a woman.

00:30:11,596 --> 00:30:12,964
If your dominant
is the killer,

00:30:13,031 --> 00:30:15,567
she would most likely
choose a slave to assist her.

00:30:15,633 --> 00:30:17,402
Someone she could
trust and control.

00:30:17,468 --> 00:30:19,304
Which would be a man.
Mm.

00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:22,040
Amateurs often play scenes
in groups.

00:30:22,106 --> 00:30:23,374
And the dom would select slaves

00:30:23,441 --> 00:30:26,778
who share similar fantasies
and fetishes.

00:30:26,844 --> 00:30:30,582
STOKES:
Why did you lie to us
about knowing Ian Wallace?

00:30:30,648 --> 00:30:32,250
We have physical
evidence linking him

00:30:32,317 --> 00:30:33,351
to your S and M room,

00:30:33,418 --> 00:30:34,752
so we know
you know him.

00:30:34,819 --> 00:30:36,754
You had no right
to ask the question,

00:30:36,821 --> 00:30:39,224
therefore I had no obligation
to answer it.

00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:45,663
I have a warrant
to collect buccal swabs,

00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:48,766
take all your shoes,
and search your SUV.

00:30:48,833 --> 00:30:51,502
What do you need the stuff for?

00:30:51,569 --> 00:30:53,705
Doesn't matter.
I have a warrant.

00:30:53,771 --> 00:30:54,939
I can take it.

00:30:55,006 --> 00:30:58,943
So why don't you tell me
what's going on?

00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:03,648
Yes, I facilitate people's
BDS&amp;amp;M scenes.

00:31:03,715 --> 00:31:05,550
It's a way to make money.

00:31:05,617 --> 00:31:07,085
It's not something I practice.

00:31:07,151 --> 00:31:08,887
I'm an entrepreneur.

00:31:08,953 --> 00:31:11,189
I majored in theater.

00:31:11,256 --> 00:31:12,924
Don't you get it?

00:31:12,991 --> 00:31:17,428
I get that you're looking
at two counts of capital murder.

00:31:17,495 --> 00:31:19,664
I hope you're a good actress.

00:31:23,067 --> 00:31:24,736
Look, Ian came in a lot.

00:31:24,802 --> 00:31:28,172
Got to know each other,
I ended up sleeping with him.

00:31:28,239 --> 00:31:30,208
At his house.
We know that, too.

00:31:30,275 --> 00:31:33,778
No. I have rules.

00:31:33,845 --> 00:31:36,314
I'm not uptight
about sex,

00:31:36,381 --> 00:31:38,116
but I like my privacy.

00:31:38,182 --> 00:31:39,183
Never been
to his house,

00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:41,886
he'd never
been to mine.

00:31:41,953 --> 00:31:43,888
Open wide.

00:31:43,955 --> 00:31:47,025
I'm not letting you take my DNA
and put it in some system

00:31:47,091 --> 00:31:48,893
where it's gonna stay
the rest of my life.

00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,228
If you're innocent,
what does it matter?

00:31:50,295 --> 00:31:51,429
That just proves
you're a fascist

00:31:51,496 --> 00:31:52,664
and this is a police state.

00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:54,499
Help me out here,
will you, Mitch?

00:31:54,566 --> 00:31:57,201
Ma'am, if you don't let
the CSI do his job,

00:31:57,268 --> 00:31:59,637
I'm gonna have to arrest you
for obstruction.

00:31:59,704 --> 00:32:01,105
(chuckles)

00:32:18,523 --> 00:32:20,358
Turned you on, didn't it?

00:32:20,425 --> 00:32:23,194
Bet you're standing
at attention.

00:32:23,261 --> 00:32:26,064
Hypocrite. You're no different

00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:27,799
than the freaks
that rent my back room.

00:32:30,635 --> 00:32:33,004
So I got a match from that
high-velocity bloodstain

00:32:33,071 --> 00:32:34,806
on the Ian Wallace shirt.

00:32:34,872 --> 00:32:36,808
Your suspect has
seven out of 13 alleles

00:32:36,874 --> 00:32:39,310
in common with
a convicted felon
named George Devlin.

00:32:39,377 --> 00:32:42,347
Look, he's still
serving time.

00:32:42,413 --> 00:32:45,550
Justine got a call
from a Martin Devlin
the night she died.

00:32:45,617 --> 00:32:46,784
BRASS:
Mr. Devlin, are you sure

00:32:46,851 --> 00:32:48,219
you don't want
to call Legal Aid

00:32:48,286 --> 00:32:49,754
and ask
for a senior attorney?

00:32:49,821 --> 00:32:52,056
I trust her completely.

00:32:52,123 --> 00:32:53,591
Okay.

00:32:53,658 --> 00:32:55,059
Let's start with the DNA sample.

00:32:55,126 --> 00:32:56,461
We refuse.

00:32:56,527 --> 00:32:57,528
Too invasive.

00:32:57,595 --> 00:32:58,796
BRASS:
We have a warrant.

00:32:58,863 --> 00:33:01,165
Then I'll file
a motion to quash it.

00:33:01,232 --> 00:33:03,101
We have Mr. Devlin's blood
on the victim's shirt

00:33:03,167 --> 00:33:05,036
and we have a mother lode
of probable cause.

00:33:05,103 --> 00:33:07,605
I'll argue that under
the Daubert Standards,

00:33:07,672 --> 00:33:11,309
your DNA analysis is
unreliable and invalid.

00:33:11,376 --> 00:33:12,543
Hmm.

00:33:16,347 --> 00:33:17,615
Please remove your shirt.

00:33:17,682 --> 00:33:18,850
I said no.

00:33:18,917 --> 00:33:19,951
Transitory evidence.
We don't need a warrant.

00:33:20,018 --> 00:33:21,019
Come on. Let's go.

00:33:33,565 --> 00:33:35,967
No, no...

00:33:37,268 --> 00:33:38,603
Needle play.

00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:41,039
You're into S and M?

00:33:42,874 --> 00:33:45,510
Stick out your tongue
and say, "Ah."

00:33:46,945 --> 00:33:48,680
Ah.

00:33:48,746 --> 00:33:50,548
Boy, I hope you have a lot
of insurance, Marty.

00:33:50,615 --> 00:33:52,517
What are you accusing
my client of?

00:33:52,584 --> 00:33:53,751
We already have his dom
in custody.

00:33:53,818 --> 00:33:55,220
Sooner or later, she's going
to roll on him,

00:33:55,286 --> 00:33:56,487
and then we have him on the hook

00:33:56,554 --> 00:33:57,622
for kidnapping
and murder.

00:33:57,689 --> 00:33:59,224
Oh, you like hooks,
don't you, Marty?

00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:00,858
I didn't kidnap anybody.

00:34:00,925 --> 00:34:02,060
Is that a confession?

00:34:02,126 --> 00:34:03,428
ATTORNEY:
I'm advising you
to remain silent.

00:34:03,494 --> 00:34:04,662
BRASS:
So what happened?

00:34:04,729 --> 00:34:06,197
You and Ms. Tournay
followed Ian Wallace home

00:34:06,264 --> 00:34:08,199
from the Lower Linx
and then you had a fight?

00:34:14,672 --> 00:34:15,907
One of you killed him.

00:34:15,974 --> 00:34:17,709
Called his girlfriend--

00:34:17,775 --> 00:34:19,077
told her she better come home.

00:34:19,143 --> 00:34:21,913
Probably planned
on framing her.

00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,381
And then you lassoed him
under Justine's car.

00:34:23,448 --> 00:34:26,417
What kind of car
do you drive, Marty?

00:34:26,484 --> 00:34:28,152
Michelle was driving
a Durango,

00:34:28,219 --> 00:34:29,587
and you were
following behind

00:34:29,654 --> 00:34:31,422
like a nice little slave.

00:34:31,489 --> 00:34:33,491
But then things
get weird.

00:34:33,558 --> 00:34:35,093
The body fell out
on the road.

00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:36,427
Justine made a break for it,

00:34:36,494 --> 00:34:37,929
and I bet you were the one

00:34:37,996 --> 00:34:39,697
who decided
to set her on fire.
Stop... stop!

00:34:39,764 --> 00:34:41,466
There are no safe words
here, Marty.

00:34:41,532 --> 00:34:42,700
This is a police station.

00:34:42,767 --> 00:34:45,370
You like pain?

00:34:45,436 --> 00:34:47,005
'Cause you're going
to be in for a treat.

00:34:47,071 --> 00:34:49,574
We're invoking. We're done.

00:34:51,109 --> 00:34:53,044
LADY HEATHER:
<i>I noticed in the autopsy report</i>

00:34:53,111 --> 00:34:55,680
that Mr. Wallace was stabbed
<i>after</i> he was dead.

00:34:55,747 --> 00:34:57,782
Right.

00:34:57,849 --> 00:35:00,585
Which would make your dom
a sexual sadist.

00:35:00,652 --> 00:35:01,753
That's highly unusual.

00:35:01,819 --> 00:35:03,221
Why?

00:35:03,288 --> 00:35:06,691
There must be sexual sadists
that seek out that world.

00:35:06,758 --> 00:35:10,595
See, sexual sadists are
typically charming loners.

00:35:10,662 --> 00:35:15,266
They would be repulsed
by a consensual, safe and
communicative lifestyle.

00:35:15,333 --> 00:35:17,702
When a submissive says
"stop," you have to stop.

00:35:17,769 --> 00:35:20,138
That doesn't work
for a sexual sadist.

00:35:20,204 --> 00:35:21,973
They get off on the terror
of their subjects.

00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:25,209
So you think that S and M play
was not involved in the murders?

00:35:25,276 --> 00:35:26,911
They were separate events?

00:35:26,978 --> 00:35:28,613
That would be my
expert opinion.

00:35:30,281 --> 00:35:33,451
May I make a personal
observation?

00:35:33,518 --> 00:35:37,355
As a friend, not
as a therapist?

00:35:37,422 --> 00:35:40,458
Everything I've told you, you
could have read in a book.

00:35:40,525 --> 00:35:44,062
I think the case
is a mere pretext

00:35:44,128 --> 00:35:46,798
and you're here for
a more personal reason.

00:35:46,864 --> 00:35:49,634
SIDLE:
<i>Before I left,</i>

00:35:49,701 --> 00:35:52,070
you said some things
that I tried not to hear,

00:35:52,136 --> 00:35:55,306
but now, uh, I think
you were right.

00:35:55,373 --> 00:35:59,510
If a relationship
can't move forward,

00:35:59,577 --> 00:36:01,479
it withers.

00:36:03,414 --> 00:36:07,652
I've been waiting
for you to decide.

00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:13,591
But sometimes not making a
decision is making a decision.

00:36:15,393 --> 00:36:17,729
Where's Sara?

00:36:23,798 --> 00:36:25,099
What stopped you?

00:36:25,166 --> 00:36:27,635
I don't know.

00:36:27,702 --> 00:36:29,136
A lot of things.

00:36:29,203 --> 00:36:31,272
Devotion to your work?

00:36:31,339 --> 00:36:34,875
Loyalty to the team?
Fear of the unknown?

00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:38,212
Do you regret your decision
not to go with her?

00:36:40,081 --> 00:36:42,083
It was beyond my control.

00:36:42,149 --> 00:36:44,719
Really?

00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:50,992
Most relationships
are over before they end.

00:36:51,058 --> 00:36:53,694
But it's still
a death.

00:36:53,761 --> 00:36:56,197
You mourn the loss,
have conflicting emotions--

00:36:56,263 --> 00:36:58,933
but oftentimes
there's a sense of relief.

00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,569
We've all experienced it,
but no one wants to admit it.

00:37:03,604 --> 00:37:06,607
I didn't say
the relationship was over.

00:37:06,674 --> 00:37:08,042
You didn't have to.

00:37:08,109 --> 00:37:11,212
Not making a decision
was your decision.

00:37:15,182 --> 00:37:17,685
SIDLE:
<i>Anyway, what I'm trying</i>
<i>to say is, uh...</i>

00:37:17,752 --> 00:37:21,756
you don't have to worry
about me anymore.

00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:24,158
I'm good.

00:37:24,225 --> 00:37:26,093
I'm really good.

00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,596
And honestly...

00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:31,866
I think it's better this way.

00:37:31,932 --> 00:37:35,436
I think you're here
because it's not home.

00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,505
It's not work.

00:37:37,571 --> 00:37:40,408
And this is the only place
that doesn't remind you of Sara.

00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,682
I have a guest bedroom
upstairs.

00:37:47,748 --> 00:37:52,687
You can stay
as long as you want.

00:37:56,424 --> 00:37:58,492
JOHNSON:
I pulled Martin Devlin's info

00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:00,695
from his SIM card.

00:38:00,761 --> 00:38:05,599
Guy's a big talker, but no calls
to or from Michelle Tournay.

00:38:05,666 --> 00:38:08,736
Did they text?

00:38:08,803 --> 00:38:11,105
Well, these are all the texts.

00:38:11,172 --> 00:38:15,009
Again, nothing to or from
Michelle Tournay.

00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:18,612
Devlin called
our female vic at 8:12.

00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:22,550
They talked until 8:29.

00:38:22,616 --> 00:38:25,519
He sent that text
one minute later.

00:38:28,289 --> 00:38:30,858
Are we ready to see this photo?

00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:41,802
RILEY:
Holy crap.

00:38:41,869 --> 00:38:44,305
That's our suspect's attorney.

00:38:44,372 --> 00:38:47,508
I didn't see that coming.

00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:49,343
Crisscross the phone number.

00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,512
Yeah.

00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:55,816
Who the hell is
Marshall Jeffries?

00:38:55,883 --> 00:38:57,852
It's one digit
off from Justine's number.

00:38:57,918 --> 00:38:59,020
He must have panicked--

00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:00,655
typed in the wrong number

00:39:00,721 --> 00:39:04,191
and sent the money shot
to a stranger.

00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:06,027
We have a
new suspect.

00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:10,164
BRASS:
How do you know
Martin Devlin?

00:39:10,231 --> 00:39:11,399
We just met.

00:39:11,465 --> 00:39:12,833
Come on.

00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:15,002
I called Legal Aid.

00:39:15,069 --> 00:39:17,605
There's no record of him
in the database.

00:39:17,672 --> 00:39:20,107
I'm sure it's a clerical error.

00:39:20,174 --> 00:39:22,610
Counselor, isn't it
a conflict of interest

00:39:22,677 --> 00:39:24,979
to represent Mr. Devlin
while you're having

00:39:25,046 --> 00:39:27,348
an intimate relationship
with one of his victims?

00:39:27,415 --> 00:39:30,251
Lawyer by day,

00:39:30,318 --> 00:39:32,086
dominatrix by night.

00:39:32,153 --> 00:39:34,088
Similar skill set.

00:39:42,063 --> 00:39:44,965
I was at Ian's house
the night of the murder...

00:39:45,032 --> 00:39:47,234
but I left just after
that picture was taken.

00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:48,369
Why'd you kill him?

00:39:48,436 --> 00:39:49,537
I didn't.

00:39:49,603 --> 00:39:50,638
So Martin did?

00:39:50,705 --> 00:39:54,041
He swore to me he was innocent.

00:39:54,108 --> 00:39:56,277
But I don't know.

00:39:58,412 --> 00:40:02,416
The three of us did a scene
together at the Lower Linx.

00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:04,585
I lost control.

00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:11,525
<i>I got really turned on...</i>

00:40:15,363 --> 00:40:17,231
<i>kissed him.</i>

00:40:17,298 --> 00:40:20,601
<i>Martin got jealous,</i>
<i>stepped out of his role.</i>

00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:22,903
So you're in love with Ian,
Martin's in love with you,

00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:24,238
they're both your slaves.

00:40:24,305 --> 00:40:25,940
Sounds like a kinky soap opera.

00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:28,442
(sighs)

00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:31,045
Yes.

00:40:31,112 --> 00:40:33,414
I broke every rule.

00:40:33,481 --> 00:40:34,849
Ian went home.

00:40:34,915 --> 00:40:37,585
I wanted to tell him
how I felt, so I followed him.

00:40:37,652 --> 00:40:39,854
I love you.

00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,757
I can tell you feel the same.

00:40:42,823 --> 00:40:45,059
You think I'm going
to introduce you
to my parents

00:40:45,126 --> 00:40:47,161
and let you
raise my kids?

00:40:47,228 --> 00:40:48,729
My girlfriend's going
to be home soon.

00:40:48,796 --> 00:40:50,731
You got to go.

00:40:50,798 --> 00:40:53,134
Get a grip.
It was just sex.

00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,302
KUMARI:
<i>Martin came in the back door.</i>

00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:56,604
<i>He went after Ian.</i>

00:40:56,671 --> 00:40:59,206
<i>This time,</i>
<i>I didn't try to stop it.</i>

00:40:59,273 --> 00:41:00,675
<i>Then Ian threw us both out.</i>

00:41:00,741 --> 00:41:01,976
I watched Martin drive away.

00:41:02,043 --> 00:41:03,678
He could have gone back,

00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:06,947
but there is no way he would
have killed the girlfriend.

00:41:07,014 --> 00:41:09,483
Not like that.

00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:12,520
WILLOWS:
We have evidence linking
the lawyer to Ian.

00:41:12,586 --> 00:41:16,123
Her DNA was at the Lower Linx
as well as at the house.

00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:19,226
Which means Michelle Tournay
is no longer a suspect.

00:41:19,293 --> 00:41:21,228
But there's an issue.

00:41:21,295 --> 00:41:23,297
Lawyer wears a
size six shoe.

00:41:23,364 --> 00:41:25,199
Shoe impressions found
in the desert are too big

00:41:25,266 --> 00:41:26,334
to be hers.

00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,002
Plus, she drives a Mini Cooper.

00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:30,371
So there's no match
to the tire impressions.

00:41:30,438 --> 00:41:33,841
Which means we can't place her
at Justine's crime scene.

00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:36,577
Or link her
to Ian's body dump.

00:41:36,644 --> 00:41:38,879
How about Martin Devlin?

00:41:38,946 --> 00:41:41,782
The feet are too big,
car isn't a match.

00:41:41,849 --> 00:41:43,484
I even checked both
their credit records.

00:41:43,551 --> 00:41:45,052
Neither one rented a car.

00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:47,154
So we're missing
the third side

00:41:47,221 --> 00:41:48,589
of the evidence trinity.

00:41:48,656 --> 00:41:50,424
We can link the scenes
and the victims,

00:41:50,491 --> 00:41:52,560
but we can't link the suspects
to the crime scenes.

00:41:52,626 --> 00:41:55,029
The back door was unlocked.

00:41:55,096 --> 00:41:56,630
Anybody could have walked
right in there.

00:41:56,697 --> 00:41:58,566
SANDERS:
So are we saying
it was random.

00:41:58,632 --> 00:42:00,001
or they were targeted?

00:42:00,067 --> 00:42:03,404
The S and M factor gave us
all tunnel vision.

00:42:03,471 --> 00:42:04,672
I disagree.

00:42:04,739 --> 00:42:06,040
We followed the evidence.

00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:08,576
SANDERS:
Which tells us
that the same night

00:42:08,642 --> 00:42:10,378
Ian's play date went wrong,

00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:14,015
a couple of psychopaths just
happened to torture, kidnap

00:42:14,081 --> 00:42:16,117
and kill our vics?

00:42:25,126 --> 00:42:27,294
(screaming)

00:42:31,065 --> 00:42:33,067
According to Locard's theory,

00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:34,702
we're still missing something.

00:42:42,376 --> 00:42:45,946
There's still got to be
evidence out there.
