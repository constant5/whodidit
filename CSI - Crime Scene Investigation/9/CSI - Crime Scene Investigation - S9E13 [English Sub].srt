00:00:17,284 --> 00:00:19,152
(clicking)

00:00:31,032 --> 00:00:32,333
(motor whirring)

00:00:57,959 --> 00:01:00,094
(tires squealing)

00:01:04,865 --> 00:01:06,867
(motor whirring)

00:01:22,783 --> 00:01:24,518
(grunting)

00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:37,897
The call did say 419
at Choozy's Chicken.

00:01:37,964 --> 00:01:39,833
BRASS:
Not him.

00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:41,134
Him.

00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:42,902
Oh, careful, guys.

00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:44,337
It's real slippery back here.

00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:47,107
BRASS:
Manager Bob Graham,
Salt Lake City, Utah.

00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:50,443
Had a whopping $42
in his wallet.

00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:53,079
Make that $62.
Who found him?

00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:54,881
Well, a patrol car
went by and saw

00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,117
the broken window
around 12:15 A.M.

00:01:57,183 --> 00:01:58,852
Place closes
at 11:00 P.M.,

00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:01,254
so a call went out to
the night manager,

00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:02,522
Kiwi Long.

00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:03,857
Floor's covered in oil.

00:02:03,923 --> 00:02:06,292
Probably
from the fryer.

00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,827
It does look a bit low.

00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:11,564
And it's still on.

00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,099
Looks like somebody interrupted

00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,034
closing time.

00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:17,470
LANGSTON:
I have a backpack here.

00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,475
PHILLIPS:
Vic has multiple
lacerations,

00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:24,477
contusions

00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:26,479
and fractures.

00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:28,782
All confined to his
face and skull.

00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:32,385
Razor's still wet.

00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:34,654
A little personal hygiene
at the dish sink? Yum.

00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:36,956
A pair of jeans.

00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:38,758
Men's.

00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,460
Too small to be
the victim's.

00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,440
This stuff's got to be
an employee's.

00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,141
Somebody's using this place
as a motel.

00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:56,943
Maybe Big Bob caught them
checking in

00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,445
and things went
very wrong.

00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:01,448
If Backpack Dude
had a key, then why use

00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,383
the mascot as a battering ram?

00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:07,520
I'm Choozy Chicken,
the chicken of choice,

00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:10,223
but you can just call me
delicious!

00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,291
(crowing)

00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:12,659
(audio powering down)

00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:14,160

Registers are empty.

00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,452
Robbery?

00:04:01,518 --> 00:04:02,586
Not sure.

00:04:02,653 --> 00:04:03,687
You know, back in high school,

00:04:03,754 --> 00:04:05,489
I used to work
at a fast food place.

00:04:05,556 --> 00:04:07,257
We would put the cash
in a drop safe

00:04:07,324 --> 00:04:08,859
and leave the registers
open to show

00:04:08,926 --> 00:04:10,427
that there wasn't
anything to steal.

00:04:10,494 --> 00:04:12,830
I'm gonna go check
the manager's office.

00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:16,800
You find something, Ray?

00:04:16,867 --> 00:04:18,068
Will you kill

00:04:18,135 --> 00:04:19,770
the overhead
fluorescents, please?
Yeah.

00:04:25,209 --> 00:04:27,711
Drag marks.

00:04:27,778 --> 00:04:29,646
Starting from the fryer...

00:04:29,713 --> 00:04:31,081
leading to the back door,

00:04:31,148 --> 00:04:33,417
diminishing
as they go.

00:04:34,952 --> 00:04:36,453
Possible second victim?

00:04:37,488 --> 00:04:39,423
Possibly.

00:04:40,924 --> 00:04:41,925
And the blood...

00:04:41,992 --> 00:04:43,494
tell you anything special?

00:04:45,329 --> 00:04:46,897
LANGSTON:
Tails on the blood drops

00:04:46,964 --> 00:04:49,800
establish directionality.

00:04:51,568 --> 00:04:53,470
But these tails indicate

00:04:53,537 --> 00:04:56,807
that the blood is going
into the kitchen.

00:04:56,874 --> 00:04:59,810
Drag marks
lead outside.

00:05:01,478 --> 00:05:02,679
Oil out,

00:05:02,746 --> 00:05:03,947
blood in.

00:05:04,014 --> 00:05:06,316
Good observation.

00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:34,077
Nick.

00:05:37,448 --> 00:05:38,949
LANGSTON:
Can't be full of oil

00:05:39,016 --> 00:05:40,818
if it's full of body.

00:05:44,188 --> 00:05:46,089
Nothing.

00:05:51,295 --> 00:05:53,163
This drum doesn't belong
to Choozy's Chicken.

00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,665
It says, "Mr. Hu's

00:05:54,731 --> 00:05:55,966
Mandarin Kitchen".

00:05:56,033 --> 00:05:57,801
What, do you eat a lot
of Chinese or something?

00:05:57,868 --> 00:05:59,937
I wrote a journal article
about dengue fever.

00:06:00,003 --> 00:06:01,371
Most of the research
was in Mandarin.

00:06:01,438 --> 00:06:02,372
Oh, well,
that's good.

00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:03,874
Then, you and
Mr. Hu will have

00:06:03,941 --> 00:06:05,042
a lot to discuss.

00:06:05,108 --> 00:06:07,744
My Mandarin's a little...
a little rusty.

00:06:16,286 --> 00:06:17,721
Skid marks.

00:06:17,788 --> 00:06:19,590
Somebody was
in a hurry.

00:06:23,093 --> 00:06:24,294
Scuff marks on the pole.

00:06:28,465 --> 00:06:30,167
I have something.

00:06:33,604 --> 00:06:34,738
Mirror.

00:06:36,507 --> 00:06:37,908
Looks like transfer.

00:06:40,444 --> 00:06:42,446
Looks like the killer
and whoever he was dragging

00:06:42,513 --> 00:06:44,782
made a not-so-clean getaway.

00:06:44,848 --> 00:06:46,250
I'm Kiwi Long, manager on call.

00:06:46,316 --> 00:06:47,251
BRASS:
Captain Jim Brass.

00:06:47,317 --> 00:06:48,752
Mister--

00:06:48,819 --> 00:06:51,188
Captain Brass, I don't know
why the alarm didn't go off.

00:06:51,255 --> 00:06:52,623
I-I was supposed
to close last night,

00:06:52,689 --> 00:06:53,690
but I've been having
some trouble

00:06:53,757 --> 00:06:55,092
with my son's babysitter.

00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:56,627
Bob said that he was going
to cover for me,

00:06:56,693 --> 00:06:58,028
and he's a regional manager,
so I figured

00:06:58,095 --> 00:07:00,264
the place was in good hands.

00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,399
Oh, my God, that could
have been me last night.

00:07:22,953 --> 00:07:25,789
BRASS:
<i>Who else, uh,</i>
<i>closed up last night?</i>

00:07:25,856 --> 00:07:27,558
Elizabeth Martin.

00:07:27,624 --> 00:07:29,326
She's one
of my best employees--

00:07:29,393 --> 00:07:30,961
really responsible.
I'm going to need

00:07:31,028 --> 00:07:32,763
to get in touch with her.
I already called her.

00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,498
It went to voicemail.

00:07:34,565 --> 00:07:35,499
Something must be wrong.

00:07:35,566 --> 00:07:37,000
She always takes my call.

00:07:53,817 --> 00:07:56,353
<i>Okay, uh, who else has the</i>
<i>combination to the drop safe?</i>

00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,754
LONG:
<i>Only me and Bob.</i>

00:07:57,821 --> 00:08:01,492
It's the day I got my promotion,
the day my son was born,

00:08:01,558 --> 00:08:04,661
and the day we got
our cat Zoey-Omega.

00:08:04,728 --> 00:08:07,297
So... 23-31-12.

00:08:13,337 --> 00:08:15,973
BRASS:
<i>Okay, I-I'm gonna need</i>
<i>all your surveillance.</i>

00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:17,307
LONG:
<i>Oh, you have to call corporate.</i>

00:08:17,374 --> 00:08:19,076
It goes straight to them.

00:08:19,143 --> 00:08:21,945
Some clips ended up
on YouTube that were,

00:08:22,012 --> 00:08:24,715
um, unflattering
to the franchise.

00:08:24,782 --> 00:08:26,683
Not on my watch, but, um,

00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,685
<i>ever since, all the</i>
<i>surveillance cameras are wired</i>

00:08:28,752 --> 00:08:32,055
<i>to a digital feed</i>
<i>in the manager's office.</i>

00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,435
BRASS:
<i>I'm gonna need</i>
<i>contact information</i>

00:08:45,502 --> 00:08:46,436
<i>for all your employees,</i>

00:08:46,503 --> 00:08:48,438
both former and current.

00:08:48,505 --> 00:08:49,807
Okay?

00:08:49,873 --> 00:08:52,309
Oh, are you going to be
contacting Bob's next of kin,

00:08:52,376 --> 00:08:54,178
or should I?
Because...

00:08:54,244 --> 00:08:57,214
I don't know who they are.

00:08:59,683 --> 00:09:01,685
(indistinct radio transmission)

00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:07,157
VARTANN:

00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:09,860
<i>The wife's dead in the bedroom.</i>

00:09:09,927 --> 00:09:10,861
<i>Mailman tried</i>

00:09:10,928 --> 00:09:13,564

00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,365
(reading)

00:09:17,401 --> 00:09:19,369
Nice house to lose.

00:09:19,436 --> 00:09:21,905
MAN:
Mr. Tucker's a mortgage broker.

00:09:21,972 --> 00:09:24,274
His wife's a real estate agent,
so they probably got

00:09:24,341 --> 00:09:25,476
first pick.

00:09:25,542 --> 00:09:26,643
There's no sign

00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:28,612
of forced entry,
but the place is a sty.

00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:32,416
Yeah, looks like he's been
living on the couch.

00:09:32,483 --> 00:09:33,984
PHILLIPS:
Thready pulse.

00:09:34,051 --> 00:09:35,719
BP's 90 over 60.
He's wasted.

00:09:35,786 --> 00:09:37,221
He's gonna need
a stomach pump.
I'm good.

00:09:37,287 --> 00:09:39,189
I'm good.

00:09:48,398 --> 00:09:50,167
Rigor's begun to set.

00:09:50,234 --> 00:09:54,404
And her liver temp is
93 degrees,

00:09:54,471 --> 00:09:56,740
which means she's been dead
three to five hours.

00:09:56,807 --> 00:09:58,509
You want to bet that
that's about the time

00:09:58,575 --> 00:09:59,510
the husband started drinking?

00:09:59,576 --> 00:10:00,811
(chuckles)

00:10:00,878 --> 00:10:01,945
Okay, I'm on my way

00:10:02,012 --> 00:10:03,380
to the hospital to
get his statement.

00:10:03,447 --> 00:10:04,848
I'll get back to you.

00:10:07,551 --> 00:10:09,820
Looks like some kind
of a struggle.
Yeah.

00:10:09,887 --> 00:10:11,421
But it wasn't a fair fight.

00:10:11,488 --> 00:10:13,390
She was handcuffed.

00:10:13,457 --> 00:10:16,260
Which under the right
circumstances can be fun.

00:10:17,861 --> 00:10:19,396
You got a C.O.D. there, Dave?

00:10:19,463 --> 00:10:21,832
Undetermined.

00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:24,101
Catherine,

00:10:24,168 --> 00:10:25,602

Trying to figure out
when's a good time to eat lunch.

00:12:18,449 --> 00:12:19,483
Lunch--

00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,285

turned into...

00:12:21,351 --> 00:12:23,353
a biohazard.

fractured cheek bones,
broken nose.

00:12:31,862 --> 00:12:33,697
And I have
some sort of a...

00:12:33,764 --> 00:12:36,233
circular trauma
to the cerebellum.

00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,335
I think he might have gotten
whacked in the head

00:12:38,402 --> 00:12:39,970
with a "wet floor" sign.

00:12:40,037 --> 00:12:41,638
(screaming):
No!

00:12:41,705 --> 00:12:43,540
So much for safety

00:12:43,607 --> 00:12:45,209
in the workplace.

00:12:45,275 --> 00:12:47,544
This is your C.O.D.

00:12:47,611 --> 00:12:50,848
High-speed impact

<i>severing the spinal cord.</i>

00:12:57,955 --> 00:12:59,656
Hit, fall, kick. Who knows?

00:12:59,723 --> 00:13:00,691
But death

00:13:00,757 --> 00:13:01,925
(phone ringing)
swift and certain.

00:13:01,992 --> 00:13:04,695
Stokes.

00:13:04,761 --> 00:13:06,230
Really.

00:13:06,296 --> 00:13:07,831
Thanks.

00:13:07,898 --> 00:13:09,900
We'll pay him a visit.

00:13:09,967 --> 00:13:12,936
Mandy got a hit off
of the side-view mirror.

00:13:13,003 --> 00:13:14,938
He's a former Choozy's
Chicken employee

00:13:15,005 --> 00:13:16,406
who's already in the system
for assaulting

00:13:16,473 --> 00:13:18,075
dear old Bob here.

00:13:18,142 --> 00:13:19,176
Let's go check him out.

00:13:19,243 --> 00:13:20,844
Okay.
Thanks, Doc.

00:13:20,911 --> 00:13:22,279
Uh, you can
just leave it.

00:13:22,346 --> 00:13:23,614
Come back later for it.

00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,048
Thank you.

00:13:30,788 --> 00:13:32,756
STOKES:
<i>Where were you</i>

00:13:32,823 --> 00:13:34,391
last night, Max?
Here.

00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:35,759
Studying.
Can anyone

00:13:35,826 --> 00:13:37,461
confirm that?
Sure.

00:13:37,528 --> 00:13:39,596
32 other frat brothers.

00:13:39,663 --> 00:13:41,431
We were all here.

00:13:41,498 --> 00:13:42,966
Studying.

00:13:43,033 --> 00:13:45,068
This side-view mirror is
from your truck.

00:13:45,135 --> 00:13:46,770
We found it
last night

00:13:46,837 --> 00:13:50,040
at the Choozy's Chicken
on Tropicana.

00:13:50,107 --> 00:13:52,109
Hey, maybe we should take
all 32 brothers

00:13:52,176 --> 00:13:53,877
downtown, what do you
think? Yeah?
Why not?

00:13:53,944 --> 00:13:55,646
Okay.

00:13:55,712 --> 00:13:57,314
Okay.

00:13:57,381 --> 00:13:59,116
Look, um,

00:13:59,183 --> 00:14:01,151
the damage was an accident.

00:14:01,218 --> 00:14:03,153
It was supposed to be
a smooth operation.

00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,254
You know?

00:14:04,321 --> 00:14:05,689
Tie him up, throw him the truck,

00:14:05,756 --> 00:14:07,291
bring him back here.

00:14:07,357 --> 00:14:10,260
But he fell, and he was
too heavy to lift.

00:14:10,327 --> 00:14:11,895
And I was working
with a new crew.

00:14:11,962 --> 00:14:15,466
So, I guess
I miscalculated.

00:14:15,532 --> 00:14:17,034
I talked to my dad,
he said he'd pay.

00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,369
You can't buy your way
out of this one.

00:14:19,436 --> 00:14:21,371
You've already assaulted him
once.

00:14:21,438 --> 00:14:23,273
Were you trying to finish
what you started?

00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,942
What the hell?!

00:14:25,008 --> 00:14:28,278
How does it feel to
be my chicken bitch?

00:14:28,345 --> 00:14:30,581
Oh, where you going?
Come on, fatty!

00:14:30,647 --> 00:14:32,783
(laughter)

00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:34,418
You embarrassed me.

00:14:34,485 --> 00:14:35,385
Forgot friendliness.

00:14:35,452 --> 00:14:37,254
And service.

00:14:37,321 --> 00:14:40,324
That's why people
choose Choozy's.

00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:42,593
(groaning)

00:14:44,394 --> 00:14:46,330
No, no, I was there last night,

00:14:46,396 --> 00:14:48,665
but I didn't run into Bob.

00:14:48,732 --> 00:14:50,634
I didn't see anybody.
The place was closed.

00:14:50,701 --> 00:14:51,802
Come on, Max.

00:14:51,869 --> 00:14:53,237
Your record
kind of speaks for itself

00:14:53,303 --> 00:14:54,271
here, man.

00:14:54,338 --> 00:14:55,939
Look, that guy was an asshat.

00:14:56,006 --> 00:14:57,975
That assault charge is bogus.

00:14:58,041 --> 00:14:59,109
Ask anybody who
was there.

00:14:59,176 --> 00:15:00,144
The dude went berserk

00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:02,146
on me-- it was self-defense.

00:15:02,212 --> 00:15:03,347
Is that what got you fired?

00:15:03,413 --> 00:15:05,182
Oh, no, I wasn't fired.

00:15:05,249 --> 00:15:06,283
I just quit.

00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,551
I only took the
job for recon.

00:15:07,618 --> 00:15:08,852
Recon?

00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:12,122
Choozy's Chicken
was the only one I didn't have.

00:15:14,024 --> 00:15:16,293
(TV playing indistinctly)

00:15:36,725 --> 00:15:39,661
Good-looking couple.

00:15:39,728 --> 00:15:42,364
You could blind yourself
on these incisors.

00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:43,632
Ting!

00:15:45,567 --> 00:15:47,235
Looks like we have a runner.

00:15:47,302 --> 00:15:50,005
WILLOWS:
Didn't know that wine
had electrolytes.

00:15:50,071 --> 00:15:52,741
They say it's good
for your heart.

00:15:52,807 --> 00:15:55,310
Yeah, a lot
of good it did her.

00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,516
Now we know how they got
those whites so pearly.

00:16:02,117 --> 00:16:04,085
Home from a run.

00:16:04,152 --> 00:16:07,022
More than halfway through

00:16:07,088 --> 00:16:08,857
an afternoon
cocktail.

00:16:08,924 --> 00:16:10,759
They haven't been
getting along,

00:16:10,826 --> 00:16:15,230
<i>he's drunk,</i>
<i>and he won't take no</i>

00:16:15,297 --> 00:16:18,400
No!
<i>for an answer.</i>

00:16:18,466 --> 00:16:20,168
Romantic.

00:16:22,137 --> 00:16:24,639
I do like the extra money
working at Choozy's gives me,

00:16:24,706 --> 00:16:27,275
but mainly, you got to keep
busy when you're my age.

00:16:27,342 --> 00:16:29,778
WEBSTER:
Sure. Sure you do.

00:16:29,845 --> 00:16:31,479
Can I just get
you to keep your
fingers straight?

00:16:31,546 --> 00:16:32,681
Dude, I can't lose
this job

00:16:32,747 --> 00:16:34,316
or my dad's gonna take
my car away.

00:16:34,382 --> 00:16:35,450
Well, if you didn't do
anything wrong,

00:16:35,517 --> 00:16:36,651
you don't have anything
to worry about.

00:16:36,718 --> 00:16:40,255
Well, Jackson's always
doing something wrong.

00:16:40,322 --> 00:16:42,491
I can't believe
this is all over Bob.

00:16:42,557 --> 00:16:44,726
Probably choked
stuffing Choozy's

00:16:44,793 --> 00:16:45,760
down his pie hole.

00:16:45,827 --> 00:16:47,329
<i>Jabrone.</i>

00:16:47,395 --> 00:16:48,897
You just didn't like him

00:16:48,964 --> 00:16:51,032
'cause he wouldn't let you
throw ice cubes in the fryer.

00:16:51,099 --> 00:16:52,601
It's the best thing
about the job, Marge.

00:16:52,667 --> 00:16:53,602
Okay,

00:16:53,668 --> 00:16:55,937
has anybody seen
Elizabeth Martin

00:16:56,004 --> 00:16:57,138
or Gary Comstock?

00:16:57,205 --> 00:16:59,107
No, I haven't seen
either of them.

00:16:59,174 --> 00:17:01,076
(mocking woman's voice)
"Ooh, Gary.

00:17:01,142 --> 00:17:03,311
Gary, could you give me
a ride home?"

00:17:03,378 --> 00:17:06,014
Dude, shut up, okay?
He's just a nice guy.

00:17:06,081 --> 00:17:07,182
Yeah, for a homeless junkie.

00:17:07,249 --> 00:17:08,917
Look who's talking.

00:17:08,984 --> 00:17:11,419
You're, like, one spliff
away from rehab,

00:17:11,486 --> 00:17:13,288
moron.

00:17:13,355 --> 00:17:14,823
Thousands in the safe.

00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:19,294
A stack of loose cash,
and only $200 missing?

00:17:19,361 --> 00:17:21,196
That's not much of a robbery.
Well, it could be.

00:17:21,263 --> 00:17:23,632
Elizabeth Martin was closing up
with Big Bob last night.

00:17:23,698 --> 00:17:26,635
I ran down her address
from her license.

00:17:26,701 --> 00:17:29,337
I mean, it's Ann
Elizabeth Martin.

00:17:29,404 --> 00:17:31,973
She's a Seven Hills
desperate housewife
with 2.5 kids

00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,142
and a Nordic silver SUV

00:17:34,209 --> 00:17:35,710
and a recurring victim

00:17:35,777 --> 00:17:37,179
of identity theft.

00:17:37,245 --> 00:17:38,346
Little lie, big lie?

00:17:38,413 --> 00:17:39,347
Could be an illegal.

00:17:39,414 --> 00:17:40,916
Someone with priors.

00:17:40,982 --> 00:17:43,084
Maybe Bob caught her
with her hand

00:17:43,151 --> 00:17:44,352
in the cookie jar.

00:17:44,419 --> 00:17:45,854
Excuse me,
Captain Brass.

00:17:45,921 --> 00:17:46,922
Wendy.

00:17:46,988 --> 00:17:48,356
Um, we just finished
getting the fingerprints

00:17:48,423 --> 00:17:49,591
and DNA from all
the Choozy's

00:17:49,658 --> 00:17:51,393
Chicken employees,
but there were two no-shows:

00:17:51,459 --> 00:17:52,394
Elizabeth Martin

00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,362
and Gary Comstock.

00:17:54,429 --> 00:17:56,097
Now, I actually got a CODIS hit

00:17:56,164 --> 00:17:57,833
from one of them

00:17:57,899 --> 00:18:00,035
'cause the epithelials
from the razor came
back to Gary.

00:18:00,101 --> 00:18:03,505
In the system
for felony drug charges?

00:18:03,572 --> 00:18:05,073
Last-known address

00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,741
was a rehab center?

00:18:06,808 --> 00:18:07,876
I called it, but they said

00:18:07,943 --> 00:18:09,544
they hadn't seen him
in six weeks.

00:18:09,611 --> 00:18:12,080
Yeah, that's because he's living
out of a backpack at Choozy's.

00:18:12,147 --> 00:18:13,181
Well, easy to do when you have

00:18:13,248 --> 00:18:14,649
a friend with a key
to the back door.

00:18:14,716 --> 00:18:18,220
So, Gary's on crack time.
He comes back there to crash.

00:18:18,286 --> 00:18:22,057
Only Bob's still there,
catches him in the act,

00:18:22,123 --> 00:18:23,458
and all hell breaks loose.

00:18:23,525 --> 00:18:25,060
What are you doing here, Gary?!

00:18:25,126 --> 00:18:27,162
(growling)

00:18:32,801 --> 00:18:33,969
Well, where's Elizabeth?

00:18:34,035 --> 00:18:36,571
Probably in an oil drum
somewhere.

00:18:36,638 --> 00:18:38,573
No honor among thieves.

00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,978
Okay, but wouldn't a drug addict
grab up all the loose cash?

00:18:44,479 --> 00:18:45,981
Anything come back
on the SAE kit?

00:18:46,047 --> 00:18:47,315
Negative.

00:18:47,382 --> 00:18:51,319
No sign of sexual
activity, forced
or consensual.

00:18:51,386 --> 00:18:53,722
So he cuffed her to the bedpost
in her underwear,

00:18:53,788 --> 00:18:55,323
but they didn't have sex.

00:18:56,391 --> 00:18:57,993
Excuse me.

00:18:58,059 --> 00:19:00,428
I just wanted to get my kit.

00:19:00,495 --> 00:19:01,429
How's business

00:19:01,496 --> 00:19:02,731
with Choozy's Chicken?

00:19:02,797 --> 00:19:05,400
A little confusing.
How's your case going?

00:19:05,467 --> 00:19:07,002
A bit confusing.

00:19:07,068 --> 00:19:08,637
You, uh, want
to stick around?

00:19:08,703 --> 00:19:12,774
Yes, I would.

00:19:12,841 --> 00:19:15,510
What do we have, Doctor?

00:19:15,577 --> 00:19:17,179
Eh...

00:19:19,047 --> 00:19:20,582
Did this woman have
a highly stressful job?

00:19:20,649 --> 00:19:21,650
Why?

00:19:21,716 --> 00:19:22,684
Gastric ulcer.

00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:23,852
Pretty advanced.

00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:25,420
Thanks.

00:19:25,487 --> 00:19:26,788
Sure. Here.

00:19:37,199 --> 00:19:38,333
Death by Smurf?

00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,035
Have you ever seen anything
like this?

00:19:40,101 --> 00:19:41,570
Nope.

00:19:43,338 --> 00:19:45,407
Minty.

00:19:45,473 --> 00:19:47,542
Fresh.

00:19:50,111 --> 00:19:52,013
Shouldn't that be
in an evidence bag?

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,315
That's not the one
from Choozy's Chicken.

00:19:53,381 --> 00:19:54,616
I took that out of our bathroom.

00:19:54,683 --> 00:19:56,852
But first I'm going
to give you the bad news.

00:19:56,918 --> 00:19:58,453
That bloody handprint
on the countertop

00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,322
that was all smudgy?

00:20:00,388 --> 00:20:02,190
I got a useable index
fingerprint off of that,

00:20:02,257 --> 00:20:03,959
but it's not a match
to anyone, including Gary.

00:20:04,025 --> 00:20:06,061
Measures about ten
inches from the tip

00:20:06,127 --> 00:20:07,562
of the middle finger
to the wrist,

00:20:07,629 --> 00:20:10,365
which is quite large for a guy
and it's huge for a woman.

00:20:10,432 --> 00:20:14,402
So we're looking for a guy
who <i>doesn't</i> work at Choozy's?

00:20:14,469 --> 00:20:15,670
Right.
Damn.

00:20:15,737 --> 00:20:17,472
Okay.
Then I got

00:20:17,539 --> 00:20:20,008
a lot of incidental
prints on the sign,

00:20:20,075 --> 00:20:22,410
all of which were
eliminated to the employees.

00:20:22,477 --> 00:20:25,380
However, there was a set
of prints that got my attention.

00:20:25,447 --> 00:20:30,352
Eight fingertips
on one side of the sign,

00:20:30,418 --> 00:20:32,153
two thumbprints on the other.

00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,089
That is an attacking grip.

00:20:34,156 --> 00:20:37,592
Right. And I found a matching
fingerprint for that

00:20:37,659 --> 00:20:39,227
on Elizabeth Martin's
register receipt.

00:20:39,294 --> 00:20:41,196
But I can't say
for sure it's hers.

00:20:41,263 --> 00:20:43,331
So I need to see
Elizabeth.

00:20:43,398 --> 00:20:45,667
Or, um, one of her fingers.

00:20:45,734 --> 00:20:47,736
(laughs) You're sick, Mandy.

00:20:47,802 --> 00:20:50,772
So it says here
that that blood drop
that I collected

00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:52,941
from the manager's
office is menstrual blood.

00:20:53,008 --> 00:20:54,876
It's weird, right?

00:20:54,943 --> 00:20:57,012
And weirder still,
it's not even Kiwi's.

00:20:57,078 --> 00:21:00,115
According to this, it's not
any of the female employees.

00:21:00,182 --> 00:21:01,983
Well, I don't have an exemplar
for Elizabeth Martin,

00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:03,018
so we can't exclude her.

00:21:03,084 --> 00:21:05,086
Pants off
in the manager's office

00:21:05,153 --> 00:21:06,421
during that time
of the month?

00:21:06,488 --> 00:21:08,456
Assault?

00:21:08,523 --> 00:21:10,358
No blood smears,

00:21:10,425 --> 00:21:12,294
no semen, no torn clothing.

00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,129
It didn't look
like a rape scene.

00:21:14,196 --> 00:21:15,664
Maybe it was consensual.

00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:16,731
With Bob?

00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:18,266
Or Gary.

00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:20,402
Or both.
Hmm.

00:21:20,468 --> 00:21:22,604
Love triangles can be deadly.

00:21:22,671 --> 00:21:24,072
Don't I know it.

00:21:24,139 --> 00:21:26,641
(speaking Mandarin)

00:21:35,517 --> 00:21:37,452
Wow. That was...

00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:39,521
well said.

00:21:39,588 --> 00:21:40,689
(speaking Mandarin)

00:21:40,755 --> 00:21:41,890
(laughs)

00:21:41,957 --> 00:21:43,859
The owner
of the restaurant is upset

00:21:43,925 --> 00:21:45,694
because his drums
keep getting stolen,

00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,529
and he's not getting
his energy rebate.

00:21:47,596 --> 00:21:49,898
Oh. I didn't know restaurants
got rebates for recycling.

00:21:49,965 --> 00:21:52,300
That's why he has security
cameras pointing straight

00:21:52,367 --> 00:21:53,635
at his drums.

00:21:53,702 --> 00:21:56,771
Well, lucky for us,
we have Mr. Hu's footage.

00:21:56,838 --> 00:21:58,974
Now, this is just
after midnight,

00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,976
same night your guy was
killed at Choozy's.

00:22:01,042 --> 00:22:02,143
Hmm.

00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:03,345
(laughs)

00:22:03,411 --> 00:22:04,646
Sweet ride, huh?

00:22:04,713 --> 00:22:06,882
Chevy Corvair.

00:22:06,948 --> 00:22:08,283
(chuckles)

00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,651
Take one,
leave an empty.

00:22:09,718 --> 00:22:11,152
At least

00:22:11,219 --> 00:22:13,288
our barrel bandits recycle.

00:22:15,123 --> 00:22:17,325
Can you get a read
off the license plate?

00:22:17,392 --> 00:22:18,827
(beep)
Yeah.

00:22:18,894 --> 00:22:20,862
(beeping)

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,603
This is Timothy
Rand's vehicle.

00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:31,106
Hmm. You know, I missed
the whole hippie thing.

00:22:31,173 --> 00:22:32,841
I was too busy

00:22:32,908 --> 00:22:35,777
in Southeast Asia keeping my
head down and my feet dry.

00:22:35,844 --> 00:22:37,913
I'm surprised you didn't
drop a little acid

00:22:37,979 --> 00:22:39,848
or smoke a little T.

00:22:39,915 --> 00:22:41,983
Well, things did get
a little wild.

00:22:43,852 --> 00:22:46,021
(clears throat)

00:22:48,757 --> 00:22:50,258
NamastÃ©.

00:22:50,325 --> 00:22:51,960
I'm Silver.

00:22:52,027 --> 00:22:53,895
Police. I'm Brass.

00:22:53,962 --> 00:22:55,063
And this is Ray Langston

00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:56,798
from the
crime lab.

00:22:56,865 --> 00:22:57,966
Is Timothy around?

00:22:58,033 --> 00:22:59,734
Oh, yeah, he's in his workshop.

00:22:59,801 --> 00:23:01,036
Here, follow me.

00:23:03,905 --> 00:23:05,707
Oh.

00:23:05,774 --> 00:23:07,909
Can you feel that?

00:23:07,976 --> 00:23:09,144
Feel what?

00:23:09,211 --> 00:23:10,378
High ratio

00:23:10,445 --> 00:23:12,180
of positive to negative ions.

00:23:12,247 --> 00:23:14,182
Ooh! Unfriendly air.

00:23:14,249 --> 00:23:15,750
But you can't let it

00:23:15,817 --> 00:23:17,152
bring you down.

00:23:17,219 --> 00:23:20,088
Scientifically proven.

00:23:20,155 --> 00:23:22,157
The Santa Anas,
the Siroccos.

00:23:22,224 --> 00:23:23,391
(laughs)

00:23:23,458 --> 00:23:25,060
You know what I'm talking about.

00:23:27,062 --> 00:23:30,332
(coughing)

00:23:30,398 --> 00:23:32,501
Timothy Rand?

00:23:32,567 --> 00:23:33,835
Oh!

00:23:33,902 --> 00:23:35,704
I know why
you're here,

00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:38,240
but this is not a crime, man.

00:23:38,306 --> 00:23:41,343
They put this valuable
resource out with the trash!

00:23:41,409 --> 00:23:44,079
Some restaurants are, you know,
pouring it down storm drains,

00:23:44,145 --> 00:23:46,681
or dumping it in the desert.

00:23:46,748 --> 00:23:49,918
If one good thing could come out
of all those caged animals

00:23:49,985 --> 00:23:51,686
hopped up on hormones,

00:23:51,753 --> 00:23:54,189
who are then slaughtered
and then frozen,

00:23:54,256 --> 00:23:56,791
only to be deep fried
and wind up as plaque

00:23:56,858 --> 00:23:59,628
in our arteries, it is this,
biodiesel.

00:23:59,694 --> 00:24:01,062
It only cost
me 200 bucks

00:24:01,129 --> 00:24:02,297
to convert my van!

00:24:02,364 --> 00:24:03,632
You know what
I'm saying?

00:24:03,698 --> 00:24:05,300
One man can...
Make a
difference!

00:24:05,367 --> 00:24:08,470
Look, this planet is our mother,
and we're all her children.

00:24:08,537 --> 00:24:10,071
That's right, baby.

00:24:11,673 --> 00:24:13,408
Where'd you get
the Choozy Chicken barrel?

00:24:13,475 --> 00:24:15,110
RAND:
The one on, uh,

00:24:15,177 --> 00:24:16,578
Tropicana.

00:24:16,645 --> 00:24:18,146
I always return them.

00:24:18,213 --> 00:24:20,982
I just haven't processed
this one yet.

00:24:25,387 --> 00:24:27,322
BRASS:
Well, congratulations.

00:24:27,389 --> 00:24:28,990
It's a boy.

00:24:38,568 --> 00:24:39,886
(shutter clicks)

00:24:45,999 --> 00:24:48,435
David, you have
the touch of a surgeon.

00:24:48,501 --> 00:24:49,936
Thank you.

00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,675
Looks like there's a blood stain
on the boxers.

00:24:55,742 --> 00:24:57,877
I'm going to need
to get those to DNA.
Will do.

00:25:05,685 --> 00:25:09,055
Ante-mortem abrasions
on the second and third knuckle.

00:25:09,122 --> 00:25:12,192
Could be from busting
up Bob's face.

00:25:16,263 --> 00:25:20,400
Extensive
third degree burns here.

00:25:20,467 --> 00:25:23,236
I'm gonna need to, uh, take
a look inside his mouth.

00:25:23,303 --> 00:25:24,904
Go ahead.

00:25:41,621 --> 00:25:43,256
DR. ROBBINS:
There are full thickness burns

00:25:43,323 --> 00:25:46,526
on all exposed surfaces
of his face.

00:25:46,593 --> 00:25:50,563
There's damage to the nares
and nasal mucosa.

00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:52,265
So his breathing
was compromised.

00:25:52,332 --> 00:25:53,600
That's your C.O.D.

00:25:53,667 --> 00:25:58,204
Asphyxia due to inhalation
of hot oil.

00:25:58,271 --> 00:25:59,806
Prints just
confirmed I.D.

00:25:59,873 --> 00:26:01,408
It's Gary Comstock.

00:26:01,474 --> 00:26:04,210
Hmm.
Ouch.

00:26:04,277 --> 00:26:05,879
Tox panel came back clean.

00:26:05,946 --> 00:26:07,881
So he wasn't using anymore.

00:26:07,948 --> 00:26:09,849
The man had
a second chance at life.

00:26:09,916 --> 00:26:12,052
Till he was murdered.

00:26:18,124 --> 00:26:19,292
Hey.

00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:22,095
Nope. Any news
on blue goo?

00:26:22,162 --> 00:26:24,064
The blue goo
was toothpaste.

00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:27,267
Approximately
12 ounces worth.

00:26:27,334 --> 00:26:28,635
Equivalent to two full tubes.

00:26:28,702 --> 00:26:29,736
Yeah, we collected

00:26:29,803 --> 00:26:32,238
a couple of empties
in the trash at the house.

00:26:32,305 --> 00:26:33,807
I'll compare them.

00:26:33,873 --> 00:26:36,943
Is it possible to O.D.
on toothpaste?

00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:38,678
Definitely, if it's
fluoride toothpaste.

00:26:38,745 --> 00:26:40,146
Each tube comes with a warning--

00:26:40,213 --> 00:26:42,515
<i>"If swallowed, please contact</i>

00:26:42,582 --> 00:26:44,618
<i>the Poison Control Center</i>
<i>immediately."</i>

00:26:45,852 --> 00:26:47,787
Never had a cavity.

00:26:47,854 --> 00:26:49,089
No joke.

00:26:49,155 --> 00:26:52,650
How much fluoride would
it take to kill a person?

00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:53,918
Depends on the person.

00:26:53,985 --> 00:26:56,888
Uh, female victim,
110 pounds.

00:26:56,955 --> 00:26:59,891
With a pre-existing
stomach ulcer.

00:26:59,958 --> 00:27:02,627
Which means it would get
into her system faster.

00:27:02,694 --> 00:27:05,396
The P.T.D.--
"Probably Toxic Dose"--

00:27:05,463 --> 00:27:07,599
is five milligrams

00:27:07,665 --> 00:27:09,801
per kilogram of body weight.

00:27:09,867 --> 00:27:13,771
A regular tube of toothpaste--
you're talking 170 grams

00:27:13,838 --> 00:27:17,442
.25 percent of which
is fluoride, so...

00:27:17,508 --> 00:27:19,844
(mumbling):
170 times...

00:27:19,911 --> 00:27:24,082
.25 is 425...
She's 50 kilograms.

00:27:24,148 --> 00:27:26,517
Yeah. So...

00:27:26,584 --> 00:27:29,120
she would need 250 milligrams
for it to be toxic.

00:27:29,187 --> 00:27:31,689
And if there's 425 milligrams
in one tube...

00:27:32,002 --> 00:27:36,140
So one tube would do it.

00:27:36,206 --> 00:27:38,542
Assuming she absorbed it all
and didn't throw it up.

00:27:38,609 --> 00:27:41,912
Well, then, for sure, two
tubes would get the job done.

00:27:41,979 --> 00:27:43,914
She would experience
what I like to call

00:27:43,981 --> 00:27:46,717
a catastrophic
symptom train.

00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,469
<i>Wicked muscle spasms</i>
<i>would give way to...</i>

00:27:50,536 --> 00:27:53,539
<i>decreased heart rate,</i>
<i>lowered blood pressure,</i>

00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:56,875
<i>decreased respiration</i>
<i>and, eventually, death.</i>

00:28:00,212 --> 00:28:02,848
Death by toothpaste.

00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:06,585
You know, I got something else.

00:28:06,652 --> 00:28:10,522
I found trace amounts of
diphenhydramine hydrochloride

00:28:10,589 --> 00:28:11,924
in her tox panel.

00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,659
Maybe she had allergies.

00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:15,527
Someone slipped it to her.

00:28:15,594 --> 00:28:16,962
I analyzed her wine.

00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:20,098
It was cheap a California merlot
with an antihistamine mickey.

00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:21,400
Why?

00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:23,402
Well, diphenhydramine
hydrochloride

00:28:23,468 --> 00:28:25,704
is both a soporific
and an antiemetic.

00:28:25,771 --> 00:28:27,873
It makes you sleepy
and it keeps you from puking.

00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:31,476
VARTANN: Paramedics found
this in your pocket.

00:28:32,844 --> 00:28:37,583
It's the key to the handcuffs
that we took off your wife.

00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:40,152
SANDERS: We checked your
Pay-Per-View selections.

00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:41,720
You've been
watching a lot

00:28:41,787 --> 00:28:43,255
of bondage porn lately.

00:28:43,322 --> 00:28:45,057
<i>Strap Daddy.</i>

00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:47,459
<i>Silk Cuffs One</i> and <i>Two.</i>

00:28:47,526 --> 00:28:49,995
What happened to my wife?

00:28:51,697 --> 00:28:52,965
Scott, there's
not enough

00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:55,300
booze in this town

00:28:55,367 --> 00:28:56,668
to make you
forget murder.

00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:17,789
Fluoride poisoning?
Are you kidding me with this?

00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:20,592
No. See I'm thinking
you're a mortgage broker.

00:29:20,659 --> 00:29:22,527
Your business is in the crapper.

00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,363
The bank is trying
to foreclose on your house

00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,198
and your wife had a very nice
insurance policy.

00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:29,001
Nice enough for you to
pay off all those debts.

00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:31,336
You see where I'm going, Scott?

00:29:31,403 --> 00:29:32,804
Look, I'll admit things
weren't that great

00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:33,972
between Melinda and I.

00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:36,308
Okay? She blamed me
for losing the house

00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:38,377
and... everything else.

00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,946
But those handcuffs
are from better times.

00:29:41,013 --> 00:29:42,447
We hadn't had sex in months.

00:29:42,514 --> 00:29:45,517
We, uh, checked
your medical records.

00:29:45,584 --> 00:29:47,486
You have
receding gums.

00:29:47,553 --> 00:29:51,490
So what?
Who cares about my gums?

00:29:51,557 --> 00:29:55,093
Well, you use a special,
high fluoride toothpaste.

00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,995
We found your prints

00:29:57,062 --> 00:29:59,164
all over these.

00:29:59,231 --> 00:30:02,501
Yeah. Before Melinda
became a real estate agent,

00:30:02,568 --> 00:30:04,636
she was a dental hygienist.

00:30:04,703 --> 00:30:05,637
We had boxes

00:30:05,704 --> 00:30:06,838
of that stuff
lying around.

00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:09,908
Free samples.
We both used it.

00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:12,077
Look, if I had tried to cram
toothpaste down Melinda's throat

00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:13,745
she would have kicked me
in the cubes.

00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:25,557
Hey, Ray. Did your
"Barrel Boy" wear glasses?

00:30:25,624 --> 00:30:27,226
Not according
to his DMV record.

00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:28,360
But Big Bob did.

00:30:28,427 --> 00:30:29,528
Huh.

00:30:29,595 --> 00:30:31,430
Halt. You can't bring
food in here.

00:30:35,067 --> 00:30:36,568
Not my rules.

00:30:42,975 --> 00:30:45,444
I found this in the fryer oil.

00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:48,747
Along with two metal screws,
which was the giveaway.

00:30:48,814 --> 00:30:51,650
Cheap plastic frames and lenses.

00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:55,954
These don't look
like French fries.

00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:57,222
That's because those are
bits of Gary.

00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:00,225
And what were these?

00:31:00,292 --> 00:31:03,061
Once upon a time,
those were $180.

00:31:03,128 --> 00:31:04,463
How do we know that?

00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:06,665
(chuckles)

00:31:09,635 --> 00:31:11,136
All right, what am
I looking at here?

00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:13,805
You are looking at
a plastic security strip.

00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,541
It's embedded
in all U.S. bank notes.

00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:18,810
Supposedly to prevent
counterfeiting.

00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:21,046
Although I've heard that they
can be read by satellites,

00:31:21,113 --> 00:31:24,016
so the "Man" knows how much
money's in your pocket.

00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:26,885
And we still
can't find Bin Laden.

00:31:26,952 --> 00:31:28,787
Nine plastic strips.

00:31:28,854 --> 00:31:31,957
Nine twenties-- $180.

00:31:32,024 --> 00:31:34,560
Plus the 20 we found in
the dead manager's pocket.

00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:37,663
So all the missing money
from Choozy's Chicken

00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,131
is accounted for.

00:31:39,198 --> 00:31:40,899
Which means
there was no robbery.

00:31:40,966 --> 00:31:41,934
STOKES:
<i>We've got evidence</i>

00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,902
that isn't telling us
the whole story.

00:31:43,969 --> 00:31:46,271
So... let's walk
through this again.

00:31:46,338 --> 00:31:47,306
Shall we?

00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:50,475
Bob was on the floor here.

00:31:50,542 --> 00:31:51,877
There were oil drag marks

00:31:51,944 --> 00:31:54,580
leading from the kitchen
to the Dumpster.

00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:56,315
And we now know
that Gary was

00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:58,850
dragged outside
and put into an oil drum.

00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:02,054
There was also a blood trail
leading in from the Dumpster

00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:06,258
as well as blood stains
on Gary's boxer shorts.

00:32:06,325 --> 00:32:10,829
Now, DNA confirms that both
samples were "Dead Bob's" blood.

00:32:10,896 --> 00:32:12,431
Bob bled on Gary
dragging him out,

00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:15,667
and then bled on the ground
when he walked back in.

00:32:15,734 --> 00:32:17,436
But did Bob kill Gary?

00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:19,805
Or was there another assailant?

00:32:19,872 --> 00:32:21,039
All right.

00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:26,311
I'll be Gary.
You be Big Dead Bob.

00:32:26,378 --> 00:32:27,646
Seriously.

00:32:27,713 --> 00:32:28,647
Yeah.

00:32:28,714 --> 00:32:30,315
Seriously.

00:32:30,382 --> 00:32:34,453
Okay.
We struggle.
We struggle.

00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:36,388
You shove my face in the oil.

00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:44,963
(gasping)

00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:48,133
That could explain...

00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,435
how Bob's glasses ended up
in the fryer.

00:32:50,502 --> 00:32:52,504
ADAMS: As well as
the missing $200

00:32:52,571 --> 00:32:54,540
that could've slipped out
of his shirt pocket.

00:32:54,606 --> 00:32:56,408
Let's do it again.

00:32:59,411 --> 00:33:01,580
Look at
your left hand.

00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:05,250
You're using it as leverage.

00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:07,920
If Bob pushed Gary
into the fryer,

00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,555
the handprint we collected
would be Bob's.

00:33:09,621 --> 00:33:11,690
But it's not.

00:33:11,757 --> 00:33:14,593
Well, the evidence
can't be wrong...

00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,962
but we could be.

00:33:19,893 --> 00:33:22,596
WILLOWS:
What you doing?

00:33:22,662 --> 00:33:24,364
I needed to see
for myself

00:33:24,431 --> 00:33:27,501
the volume of 340 grams
of toothpaste.

00:33:27,567 --> 00:33:29,403
You know, unencumbered
by a tube

00:33:29,469 --> 00:33:31,438
it is an awful lot.

00:33:31,505 --> 00:33:33,940
Join in. I used to
do this as a kid.

00:33:34,007 --> 00:33:36,943
(grunting)
Now we get paid for doing it.

00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:38,845
Even with an anti-emetic,

00:33:38,912 --> 00:33:42,349
how would you force
this much toothpaste
down someone's throat?

00:33:42,416 --> 00:33:43,717
Mm.

00:33:43,784 --> 00:33:45,719
Excuse me for interrupting
arts and crafts,

00:33:45,786 --> 00:33:49,456
Ah, it's an experiment.
Well, maybe for you.

00:33:49,523 --> 00:33:51,458
The toothpaste
that Mrs. Tucker ingested

00:33:51,525 --> 00:33:52,893
contained a bleaching agent.

00:33:52,959 --> 00:33:54,995
The tubes you collected didn't.

00:33:58,432 --> 00:34:03,036
There were two empty tubes of
toothpaste in their bedroom,

00:34:03,103 --> 00:34:06,139
but it's not the toothpaste
that killed her.

00:34:06,206 --> 00:34:08,308
Arts and crafts are over.

00:34:08,375 --> 00:34:10,143
Gotta go back
to the house.

00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:26,126
Their life in garbage.

00:34:26,193 --> 00:34:27,527
And no toothpaste.

00:34:36,303 --> 00:34:37,604
STOKES:
Nothing on the ground

00:34:37,671 --> 00:34:38,939
or in the planter.

00:34:49,816 --> 00:34:51,651
Shoe rubber.

00:34:54,821 --> 00:34:56,490
STOKES:
The gate was locked.

00:34:56,556 --> 00:34:57,657
Homeowner's about 80.

00:34:57,724 --> 00:34:58,992
Once I asked
loudly enough,

00:34:59,059 --> 00:35:01,461
she gave us permission to
search without a warrant.

00:35:13,774 --> 00:35:16,510
Fluoride toothpaste
with bleach.

00:35:25,252 --> 00:35:26,753
Hey, Mandy.

00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:29,256
Okay, you know what,
no more shotgun approach.

00:35:29,322 --> 00:35:30,991
You need to start
prioritizing
your latents.

00:35:31,058 --> 00:35:34,227
No, no, I'm only interested
in one print, the handprint.

00:35:34,294 --> 00:35:36,763
O-kay, but I already put
that through the database.

00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:38,765
Well, we're having
a little disparity

00:35:38,832 --> 00:35:40,767
between context
and the evidence.

00:35:40,834 --> 00:35:42,669
What are you asking me?

00:35:42,736 --> 00:35:45,305
Is it possible
the print got distorted?

00:35:45,372 --> 00:35:48,742
Well, you can only distort
prints with pressure

00:35:48,809 --> 00:35:50,811
or body weight.

00:35:50,877 --> 00:35:52,145
Well, we do now think

00:35:52,212 --> 00:35:54,414
that the surface print
was left during a struggle,

00:35:54,481 --> 00:35:55,582
and Bob Graham was a big boy,

00:35:55,649 --> 00:35:58,518
so can you run that index
finger for me again?

00:35:58,585 --> 00:35:59,920
Yeah, okay.
Thank you.

00:36:01,788 --> 00:36:04,224
(computer trilling)

00:36:08,228 --> 00:36:10,130
It's a reversal.

00:36:10,197 --> 00:36:13,900
<i>There must have been enough</i>
<i>pressure to invert the print.</i>

00:36:13,967 --> 00:36:15,869
I'm sorry,
I missed it. Okay.

00:36:15,936 --> 00:36:18,505
Right. Do you see how
these appear to be ridges,

00:36:18,572 --> 00:36:20,507
but there is no
sweat glands?
Mm-hmm.

00:36:20,574 --> 00:36:23,677
Which is because
those are furrows.

00:36:23,744 --> 00:36:24,745
(taps key, computer trills)

00:36:25,545 --> 00:36:26,546
(Webster sighs)

00:36:29,316 --> 00:36:31,184
It's a match. I'm sorry.
(cell phone rings)

00:36:31,251 --> 00:36:32,619
It's okay,
you're human.

00:36:32,686 --> 00:36:33,653
Stokes.

00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,155
Hey, Nicky,
I got Elizabeth Martin

00:36:35,222 --> 00:36:36,823
from her canceled
payroll checks.

00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:38,325
The bank gave me her address.

00:36:38,392 --> 00:36:39,826
STOKES:
So she's alive.
Oh, yeah.

00:36:39,893 --> 00:36:41,762
Did her record kick
back any priors?

00:36:41,828 --> 00:36:44,231
No record.
Immigration got wind of it.

00:36:44,297 --> 00:36:45,832
They scooped up
her whole family.

00:36:45,899 --> 00:36:49,403
She's an illegal
working here on a fake I.D.

00:36:49,469 --> 00:36:51,271
She's in Interrogation now.

00:36:51,338 --> 00:36:52,773
I'll let you know
how it turns out.

00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:53,774
All right.

00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,710
Hello.

00:36:56,777 --> 00:36:59,713
I'm Detective Jim Brass,
Las Vegas Police.

00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:01,014
Okay.

00:37:01,081 --> 00:37:03,917
Let's start
with an easy question.

00:37:03,984 --> 00:37:05,318
What's your real name?

00:37:08,188 --> 00:37:10,123
Rosa Gonzales.

00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:13,927
Okay, Rosa Gonzales...

00:37:13,994 --> 00:37:15,962
tell me what happened
at Choozy's Chicken

00:37:16,029 --> 00:37:18,031
the other night.

00:37:19,766 --> 00:37:21,702
I didn't mean to kill him.

00:37:21,768 --> 00:37:23,036
(calculator clacking)

00:37:23,103 --> 00:37:24,738
You wanted to see me?

00:37:24,805 --> 00:37:25,806
Your drop bag was short.

00:37:25,872 --> 00:37:27,441
I checked it twice.

00:37:28,775 --> 00:37:31,478
You want me to call
the police, huh?!

00:37:34,281 --> 00:37:36,249
(whispers):
I'm gonna have to do
a strip search.

00:37:37,851 --> 00:37:41,221
He made me take off
all my clothes.

00:37:41,288 --> 00:37:43,990
Did he assault you?
Touch you?

00:37:44,057 --> 00:37:46,393
He put his hands on me.

00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:48,028
No!

00:37:49,162 --> 00:37:50,797
(whimpers in protest)

00:37:50,864 --> 00:37:51,965
(grunts)

00:37:52,032 --> 00:37:53,100
What the hell is this?!

00:37:53,166 --> 00:37:55,502
What are you doing here, Gary?!

00:37:55,569 --> 00:37:57,904
I'm not the issue here, Bob.

00:37:57,971 --> 00:37:59,840
(growling)

00:37:59,906 --> 00:38:01,408
Then what happened?

00:38:01,475 --> 00:38:02,743
I got dressed.

00:38:02,809 --> 00:38:04,077
I could hear them fighting.

00:38:04,144 --> 00:38:06,279
I went out into the kitchen.

00:38:06,346 --> 00:38:08,415
(Bob yelling)
ROSA: Stop it!

00:38:08,482 --> 00:38:10,584
(Bob grunting,
Gary groaning)

00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:11,451
(Bob screaming with pain)

00:38:11,518 --> 00:38:13,120
GARY:
Get out of here!

00:38:13,186 --> 00:38:15,856
What the hell are you doing,
Bob?!

00:38:15,922 --> 00:38:18,291
(grunting)

00:38:18,358 --> 00:38:19,493
(gurgling)

00:38:19,559 --> 00:38:21,428
I ran.

00:38:21,495 --> 00:38:23,263
But I swear to the Virgin
herself,

00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:24,965
I was just trying to help Gary.

00:38:25,032 --> 00:38:27,734
Hitting him with the sign
isn't what killed him.

00:38:29,603 --> 00:38:31,505
So I can go home?

00:38:31,571 --> 00:38:34,841
Miss Gonzales, you see
the immigration agent

00:38:34,908 --> 00:38:36,243
outside with your family.

00:38:36,309 --> 00:38:38,211
They tell me that you're
in this country illegally.

00:38:38,278 --> 00:38:39,546
I grew up here.

00:38:39,613 --> 00:38:40,881
I work.

00:38:40,947 --> 00:38:42,516
I take care of my family.

00:38:42,582 --> 00:38:45,419
I believe you, I do,

00:38:45,485 --> 00:38:47,487
but it's not my call.

00:38:54,628 --> 00:38:57,497
Well, we've exhausted
every suspect,

00:38:57,564 --> 00:38:59,666
and we still don't know
who killed Bob.

00:38:59,733 --> 00:39:01,668
Well, at this point,
it's a locked room mystery.

00:39:01,735 --> 00:39:02,836
Mm-hmm.

00:39:02,903 --> 00:39:05,672
After all that
we've been through,

00:39:05,739 --> 00:39:07,374
how can you guys
eat that?

00:39:07,441 --> 00:39:08,809
Power of suggestion.

00:39:08,875 --> 00:39:10,477
And because I can't help myself.

00:39:10,544 --> 00:39:11,878
They're good.
It's 'cause

00:39:11,945 --> 00:39:13,046
they put crack
in the fries.
Hmm?

00:39:13,113 --> 00:39:15,716
Mm.

00:39:24,591 --> 00:39:26,960
What if the room is the suspect?

00:39:29,162 --> 00:39:32,499
According to his
insurance records,

00:39:32,566 --> 00:39:34,668
Bob had twenty-eighty vision.

00:39:34,735 --> 00:39:36,670
Without his glasses,
he was practically blind.

00:39:36,737 --> 00:39:38,839
<i>Elizabeth gave him</i>
<i>a pretty good whack</i>

00:39:38,905 --> 00:39:41,908
<i>to the cerebellum,</i>
<i>which can affect equilibrium.</i>

00:39:41,975 --> 00:39:44,044
<i>Add those factors</i>
<i>to a slippery floor...</i>

00:39:44,111 --> 00:39:46,146
(grunts)

00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:51,818
It's a case of blind justice.

00:39:53,253 --> 00:39:57,224
So when I'm filling out
the paperwork, who do I list

00:39:57,290 --> 00:39:59,393
on the suspect line?

00:39:59,459 --> 00:40:00,627
There is no suspect.

00:40:00,694 --> 00:40:01,828
It was an accident.

00:40:04,297 --> 00:40:06,867
STOKES:
The DNA from inside
the latex gloves was...

00:40:06,933 --> 00:40:08,735
You ready for this?
Scott Tucker?

00:40:08,802 --> 00:40:10,070
Related...

00:40:10,137 --> 00:40:12,072
by marriage.
Melinda?

00:40:12,139 --> 00:40:14,074
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

00:40:14,141 --> 00:40:16,410
It was suicide?
Yeah.

00:40:16,476 --> 00:40:18,745
With a nice, big frame
around it.

00:40:18,812 --> 00:40:22,416
Otherwise, why not just
pop the diphenhydramine?

00:40:22,482 --> 00:40:23,917
Why spike the wine?

00:40:23,984 --> 00:40:26,620
Well, maybe she was
trying to frame

00:40:26,686 --> 00:40:28,889
her husband
for attempted murder,

00:40:28,955 --> 00:40:31,391
hoping for a poisoning,
not a death.

00:40:31,458 --> 00:40:32,592
Doubtful.

00:40:32,659 --> 00:40:34,094
I mean, she was a hygienist.

00:40:34,161 --> 00:40:36,530
If that were the case,
she would've just stopped

00:40:36,596 --> 00:40:37,764
at one tube.

00:40:37,831 --> 00:40:40,267
Henry did say
that there was about an hour

00:40:40,333 --> 00:40:42,069
between ingestion and her death.

00:40:42,135 --> 00:40:45,138
SANDERS:
<i>Plenty of time</i>
<i>to set up the husband.</i>

00:40:59,686 --> 00:41:01,988
She goes outside, she...

00:41:02,055 --> 00:41:04,157
climbs the fence,
she ditches the evidence

00:41:04,224 --> 00:41:06,560
in the neighbor's trash,
and then...

00:41:08,061 --> 00:41:10,831
<i>...cuffs herself to the bed</i>

00:41:10,897 --> 00:41:13,133
<i>and then waits to dies?</i>

00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,435
<i>What could you</i>
<i>possibly have done</i>

00:41:15,502 --> 00:41:18,138
<i>to make your wife</i>
<i>hate you so much?</i>

00:41:18,205 --> 00:41:21,575
We used to be an amazing team
actually.

00:41:21,641 --> 00:41:23,577
She'd find the
client the house,

00:41:23,643 --> 00:41:24,911
I'd get them
financing.

00:41:24,978 --> 00:41:26,813
Everyone was happy.

00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,248
But I always told her--

00:41:28,315 --> 00:41:30,751
don't get too friendly;

00:41:30,817 --> 00:41:34,454
these are clients,
they're not friends.

00:41:34,521 --> 00:41:36,022
But she goes to all the parties.

00:41:36,089 --> 00:41:38,859
all the barbeques,
all the fund-raisers.

00:41:38,925 --> 00:41:40,560
So, when the NINJA loans
flipped over,

00:41:40,627 --> 00:41:42,095
and the banks kicked them
out of their homes

00:41:42,162 --> 00:41:44,097
because they couldn't afford
to make their payments,

00:41:44,164 --> 00:41:50,137
well, they called us,
screaming like it was our fault,

00:41:50,203 --> 00:41:52,406
and I blamed her.

00:41:52,472 --> 00:41:55,609
If she hadn't gotten
all buddy-buddy

00:41:55,675 --> 00:41:56,943
with them in the first place,

00:41:57,010 --> 00:41:58,211
they never would have
crossed that line.

00:41:58,278 --> 00:42:01,214
That's when the marriage
went belly-up.

00:42:01,281 --> 00:42:02,783
We couldn't
look each other

00:42:02,849 --> 00:42:06,119
in the face after that.

00:42:06,186 --> 00:42:07,888
I thought she was weak,

00:42:07,954 --> 00:42:11,958
and she wanted me to feel bad
because I didn't feel worse.

00:42:12,025 --> 00:42:16,496
I never thought she'd
kill herself, though.

00:42:17,831 --> 00:42:19,800
Tried to kill me
a couple of times.

00:42:19,866 --> 00:42:21,868
Couldn't sell the house,

00:42:21,935 --> 00:42:25,038
couldn't afford
to get a divorce.

00:42:25,105 --> 00:42:29,743
I can't believe
that bitch set me up.

00:42:38,819 --> 00:42:41,788
ROBBINS:
Figured it's better
than nothing

00:42:41,855 --> 00:42:43,857
till they find
you something.

00:42:48,228 --> 00:42:50,964
ROBBINS:
You could put a desk in there.

00:42:51,031 --> 00:42:53,233
It's perfect.

00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:55,435
I should check
with Catherine first.

00:42:55,502 --> 00:42:57,204
I already did.

00:42:59,539 --> 00:43:00,841
All right.

00:43:00,907 --> 00:43:03,110
Thank you, Doctor.

00:43:03,176 --> 00:43:04,444
You're welcome.

00:43:07,347 --> 00:43:09,883
I think I'll be
right at home here.
