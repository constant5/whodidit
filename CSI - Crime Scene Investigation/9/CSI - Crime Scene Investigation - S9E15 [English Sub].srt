Carsten was an art dealer.

a lot of bodies today.

There's a blood trail here.


00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:21,328

Hi.


00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:44,885
Hi... "Gareth."


00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:46,420
He must have snuck in


00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:48,589
while I was
processing the pool.


00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:51,225
Well, it's actually his house.

When was the last time
you saw Carsten?


00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,229
Um... after everybody left,


00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,898
he went outside to have
a relaxing swim to calm down.


00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,733
Why did he need to calm down?


00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,502
I'm not really sure.


00:05:01,568 --> 00:05:04,104
Uh, but during the party,
I saw him go into his office


00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:07,741

I hadn't seen before.

Party's over!

<i>Carsten was so upset.</i>


00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:19,019
But he wouldn't tell me
what happened,


00:05:19,086 --> 00:05:21,922
so I went to bed alone.


00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:26,360
The next thing, it was morning
and the pool guy was shouting


00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:28,595
to call the police.


00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,564
LANGSTON:
The office should be

00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:33,433
Is Brass getting
the surveillance?


00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,337
Yes, but there doesn't
appear to be any camera


00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:39,206
with a clear view
of the pool.


00:05:39,273 --> 00:05:41,808
Well, I doubt Hef has them
in the grotto either.

(camera shutter clicking)


00:06:10,404 --> 00:06:13,106
These are Mesopotamian vases


00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:16,677
circa 700 B.C.E.


00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:18,345
These should be in a museum.


00:06:18,412 --> 00:06:20,647
Yes, they're trophies.


00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:23,083
Collecting's pathological
whether you're a rich man


00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,985
or a serial killer.


00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,655
Oh, hey, no, Gareth!


00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,257

This all seems consistent


00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:46,173
with what Carsten's fiancÃ©e
told Brass.


00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,775
Do we have any idea
what prompted his outburst?


00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:52,646
I don't know what, but...


00:06:52,713 --> 00:06:53,847
(typing, computer trilling)


00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,649
...maybe who.


00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:58,819
See, the vic was alone in
his office with that guy


00:06:58,886 --> 00:07:00,821
for approximately
seven minutes


00:07:00,888 --> 00:07:02,890
before buzzkill.


00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:06,693
So, now all we need to do is
figure out who that guy is.


00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,329
Yeah. Let me see
what I can do.


00:07:09,396 --> 00:07:10,631
(typing)


00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:12,099
All right.


00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:18,972
(clears throat)


00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,642
Are you trying
to do my job?


00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:24,344
Eh... yes, a little.


00:07:24,411 --> 00:07:25,646
Mandy had dusted everything
for fingerprints,


00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:28,048
and unfortunately,
she came up empty.


00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:29,249
But look at this.


00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:31,251
I think that these fragments,


00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:33,320
the ones that Gareth found
so delicious,


00:07:33,387 --> 00:07:36,924
I think that they used to be a
vase that was actually stolen


00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,659
from the Iraqi
National Museum.


00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:41,595
I think it was smuggled in,
like drug-dealer style


00:07:41,662 --> 00:07:43,096
because basically,


00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:45,532
all you have to do is
take an antique vase,


00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,734
and you wrap it up in a
bunch of cellophane, right?


00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,036
You fill it with some


00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:51,605
little plastic doodads
and candy


00:07:51,672 --> 00:07:53,574
and slap a "Made in China"
sticker on there,


00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,677
and that priceless piece of art
can just sail though US Customs


00:07:56,743 --> 00:07:58,545
like a Tijuana piÃ±ata.

00:07:58,612 --> 00:07:59,680

00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:03,116
I hate actors.


00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:04,952
Okay, I have to go,


00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:06,587
but I would love
to finish putting


00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,288
that back together when I'm
done, if it's okay with you.


00:08:08,355 --> 00:08:10,724
Mm-hmm.
I love jigsaw puzzles.

So when was the last time
you saw Mr. Pennington?

00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:12,986
Uh, the other night
at his party.

00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,422
I've been acquiring
Mesopotamian antiquities

00:09:15,489 --> 00:09:16,657
on behalf of the Marrakesh

00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,959
for an exhibit
at our casino museum.

00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:21,228
I purchased a piece from
Mr. Pennington last month.

00:09:21,295 --> 00:09:22,963
He called me
and said he had

00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:26,233
a new Babylonian piece for sale,
so I went to go see it.

00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,468
It wasn't
what I was looking for.

00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:30,270
Why, because it was stolen?

00:09:30,337 --> 00:09:33,273
Like from the National
Museum of Iraq?

00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,708
Before...

00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:37,110
after.

00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:40,347
Trafficking in stolen
antiquities is illegal,

00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:42,716
and from what I hear, dangerous.

00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:44,151
Which is why people
get off on it.

00:09:44,218 --> 00:09:46,019
Not me.
Do you know who I work for?

00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,888
Yeah, Bruce Curtis,
CEO of Marrakesh Corporation.

00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:49,323
I've met him.

00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:51,959
Then you know if he found out
I compromised his reputation

00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:53,360
with something like this...

00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:54,828
You'd be ancient history.

00:09:54,895 --> 00:09:56,730
Look, I don't know
who killed Mr. Pennington,

00:09:56,797 --> 00:09:58,732
but it wasn't me.

00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:01,335
And if he was dealing
with the black market,

00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:03,303
then maybe he got
what was coming to him.

00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:06,807

It's done.

00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:32,099

He was a lot more cooperative
as a victim of art fraud

than he is as a suspect.

00:11:23,617 --> 00:11:25,953
Killing Carsten wouldn't get
his boss's money back.

No, so I checked
Pennington's bank.

That's funny his fiancÃ©e
didn't mention that.

00:11:34,661 --> 00:11:36,129

00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,182
party dress.
Oh.

00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:29,883
It's been washed.

00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:32,386
I look great in that dress.

00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:34,388
I wanted to wear it out tonight,

00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:36,523
so I had to clean it--
it was dirty.

00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:39,960
Those incriminating DNA stains
can be so hard to get out.

00:12:40,027 --> 00:12:41,995
Which is why professional
criminals

00:12:42,062 --> 00:12:44,531
prefer chlorine bleach.

00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:47,701
You use a nonenzymatic
detergent.

00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:50,871
Good for the environment...
and DNA retrieval.

00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:53,340
I want an attorney.

00:12:53,407 --> 00:12:54,942
Sure, that's your right.

00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:56,877
This is how I clean
up the planet.

00:12:56,944 --> 00:12:58,946
(handcuffs clicking)

00:13:03,817 --> 00:13:05,185
So you think
she just didn't know

00:13:05,252 --> 00:13:06,653
that her fiancÃ©
was an art faker?

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,088
She was living in
a swanky house

00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:10,891
having swell parties
and holding court

00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:11,959
with fine friends.

00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:13,560
I don't think
she really cared.

00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:15,562
Nice work, Doctor.

00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:17,397
Nice work to you, too, Simms.

00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:18,565
Thank you.

00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:19,833
Ray, excuse me.

00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,468
Could you come in here
for a minute?

00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,970
You need to see this.

00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:27,941
It's a person
of interest

00:13:28,008 --> 00:13:30,878
in that motel murder
I was working on.

00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:33,680
That looks like my 419,
Carsten Pennington.

00:13:33,747 --> 00:13:36,016
It is.

00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,451
And it isn't.

00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:05,895
Second stage instar.

00:14:05,961 --> 00:14:07,563
And since liver is fixed,

00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,798
she's been dead
no more than 48 hours.

00:14:09,865 --> 00:14:12,635
SANDERS:
So, Jena Makin from Hollywood

00:14:12,701 --> 00:14:14,603
might have died
on her 31st birthday.

00:14:15,971 --> 00:14:17,540
No cell phone.

00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:19,108
But if she has a number,

00:14:19,174 --> 00:14:20,709
we'll get the records
from the carrier.

00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:23,879
Bullets entered under the chin

00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,915
and exited the top of the skull.

00:14:25,981 --> 00:14:29,451
WILLOWS:
Blood spatter and two holes
in the ceiling.

00:14:29,518 --> 00:14:31,987
Suggests that
she was sitting up

00:14:32,054 --> 00:14:33,389
<i>when she was shot.</i>

00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:34,657
(sobbing):
Please...
(gun hammer cocks)

00:14:34,723 --> 00:14:37,826
(two gunshots)

00:14:42,364 --> 00:14:45,734
Bullets look like .38s.

00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:47,136
Probably a revolver.

00:14:47,203 --> 00:14:48,971
No casings.

00:14:54,577 --> 00:14:57,313
And they're oxidized.

00:14:57,379 --> 00:15:00,983
Our killer doesn't know
how to store ammunition.

00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:03,652
Though it looks like he knows
how to cover his tracks.

00:15:03,719 --> 00:15:06,188
Got a couple possible
wine glass stains here,

00:15:06,255 --> 00:15:09,658
but I don't remember seeing
any wine or glasses in the room.

00:15:14,597 --> 00:15:15,998
Strange-looking void.

00:15:23,072 --> 00:15:24,707
(gasps)

00:15:24,773 --> 00:15:25,741
(chuckles)

00:15:25,808 --> 00:15:28,410
Hello.

00:15:28,477 --> 00:15:29,378
What is it?

00:15:35,951 --> 00:15:37,686
A witness.

00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:48,697
(groans softly):
Oh, God.

00:15:52,434 --> 00:15:55,504
COD's no mystery--
two GSWs to the head.

00:15:55,571 --> 00:15:58,240
But I did find
some abrasions

00:15:58,307 --> 00:15:59,775
in the vaginal vault.

00:15:59,842 --> 00:16:00,943
Could indicate rape.

00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:03,412
Or rough consensual sex.

00:16:03,479 --> 00:16:06,515
Either way, the, uh, wet mount
was negative for semen.

00:16:06,582 --> 00:16:08,017
How considerate.

00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:09,251
He wore a condom.

00:16:11,287 --> 00:16:13,289
Busy night.

00:16:18,427 --> 00:16:19,895
Well, the blood void means

00:16:19,962 --> 00:16:22,598
that the tortoise was there
during the shooting.

00:16:22,665 --> 00:16:23,632
And this print

00:16:23,699 --> 00:16:26,168
has got to belong to the killer.

00:16:29,371 --> 00:16:30,873
WILLOWS:
<i>Mandy, what are you thinking?</i>

00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,908
The ASPCA is gonna shut us down.

00:16:32,975 --> 00:16:35,444
Mandy?

00:16:35,511 --> 00:16:37,046
The Amido black.

00:16:37,112 --> 00:16:38,948
It's minimally toxic;
it won't hurt him.

00:16:39,014 --> 00:16:40,249
I'll be gentle.

00:16:41,817 --> 00:16:44,320
HODGES:
Wonder if he's
a rare species.

00:16:44,386 --> 00:16:45,754
'Cause I read that
African tortoises

00:16:45,821 --> 00:16:47,690
can be worth as
much as $10,000.

00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:48,924
Just please hurry, okay?

00:16:48,991 --> 00:16:51,327
'Cause he's been traumatized
enough already.

00:16:51,393 --> 00:16:54,430
He's a material witness in
a homicide investigation.

00:16:54,496 --> 00:16:55,931
I meant traumatized by you.

00:16:58,067 --> 00:17:01,437
So who brings a tortoise
to a gunfight?

00:17:01,503 --> 00:17:03,739
If the killer was trying
to take it with him after

00:17:03,806 --> 00:17:05,307
he killed the girl,
then it stands to reason

00:17:05,374 --> 00:17:06,842
that the killer brought
it in the first place.

00:17:06,909 --> 00:17:07,943
Or maybe it was hers,

00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:09,278
which is why
he killed her.

00:17:09,345 --> 00:17:10,846
You just said
they're valuable.

00:17:10,913 --> 00:17:12,414
I got a hit.

00:17:12,481 --> 00:17:13,582
Uh, Mickey Ross.

00:17:13,649 --> 00:17:15,851
<i>The</i> Mickey Ross?

00:17:15,918 --> 00:17:18,287
Who's Mickey Ross?

00:17:18,354 --> 00:17:19,922
Mickey Ross is
only the star

00:17:19,989 --> 00:17:22,191
of the <i>Crimson Orchid</i>
film franchise.

00:17:22,258 --> 00:17:24,593
Ross plays
Dr. Harley Copen,

00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,595
physician by day,
vigilante by night.

00:17:26,662 --> 00:17:28,831
But he doesn't kill anyone;
he shoots them in the street,

00:17:28,898 --> 00:17:30,699
and then he fixes them up
in the E.R.

00:17:30,766 --> 00:17:33,135
Rumor had it

00:17:33,202 --> 00:17:37,006
that Ross had actual intercourse
with his co-star Ginger Snuff.

00:17:37,072 --> 00:17:40,376
But a frame-by-frame analysis
unfortunately disproved that.

00:17:40,442 --> 00:17:41,710
WILLOWS:
I'll call LAPD.

00:17:41,777 --> 00:17:44,813
I wonder if actor man
owns a .38.

00:17:46,382 --> 00:17:49,051
SIMMS:
Okay, I just need you
to open your...

00:17:49,118 --> 00:17:50,486
mouth.

00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,322
(chuckles)

00:17:53,389 --> 00:17:54,857
That tickles.
(giggles)

00:17:54,924 --> 00:17:56,525
They searched his place
in Hollywood, no gun.

00:17:56,592 --> 00:17:57,693
But they found these.

00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,762
They don't make
that ammo anymore.

00:18:02,965 --> 00:18:05,968
It's the same caliber,
same brand,

00:18:06,035 --> 00:18:07,236
same oxidation.

00:18:07,303 --> 00:18:09,071
He's a triple threat.

00:18:09,138 --> 00:18:13,075
You let me know
what comes back from the...

00:18:13,142 --> 00:18:15,177
electrophoresis gel.

00:18:15,244 --> 00:18:17,046
It's how they blood-type DNA.
Mm.

00:18:17,112 --> 00:18:19,181
I played a medical examiner
in <i>Killer Instinct 3.</i>

00:18:19,248 --> 00:18:22,017
Well, I'll catch that
on the History Channel,

00:18:22,084 --> 00:18:24,753
'cause we stopped blood-typing
about 15 years ago.

00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,188
Ah.

00:18:26,255 --> 00:18:28,257
Is he hitting on you?

00:18:28,324 --> 00:18:29,758
SIMMS:
Yeah, but not very well.

00:18:29,825 --> 00:18:32,328
(phone beeps)
Mm, and luckily
I have to go,

00:18:32,394 --> 00:18:35,431
'cause somebody lost
a contact lens.

00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:43,672
Look, this is just a big
misunderstanding, Detective.

00:18:43,739 --> 00:18:44,840
Mm-hmm.

00:18:44,907 --> 00:18:46,642
I loved Jena; I would
never hurt her.

00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:48,344
Where were you two nights ago?

00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:49,345
I was in LA.

00:18:49,411 --> 00:18:50,613
Wrong.

00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:52,681
You were with Jena
in her motel room.

00:18:52,748 --> 00:18:53,916
No, I was in LA.

00:18:53,983 --> 00:18:55,050
Save it.

00:18:55,117 --> 00:18:56,418
The tortoise gave you up, man.

00:18:56,485 --> 00:18:58,621
We found your prints
on his shell in Jena's blood.

00:18:59,655 --> 00:19:01,223
Wait a minute, you have Gareth?

00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:02,892
Is he okay? Can I see him?

00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:05,227
That puts you at the murder,
jackass.

00:19:08,264 --> 00:19:09,532
All right, okay.

00:19:09,598 --> 00:19:10,900
Yeah, I-I was there.

00:19:10,966 --> 00:19:11,734
Right.

00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,702
But I didn't kill her.

00:19:13,769 --> 00:19:16,305
Jena was going
through some stuff.

00:19:16,372 --> 00:19:17,406
Okay? So she wanted

00:19:17,473 --> 00:19:19,875
to go to Vegas to, uh...

00:19:19,942 --> 00:19:21,377
pick herself up,
have a little fun.

00:19:21,443 --> 00:19:22,444
You know?

00:19:22,511 --> 00:19:24,246
So I thought I'd
just drop in on her,

00:19:24,313 --> 00:19:25,247
and I brought
Gareth.

00:19:25,314 --> 00:19:27,049
She loved that tortoise.

00:19:27,116 --> 00:19:29,251
(sniffles)

00:19:29,318 --> 00:19:33,656
But when I got to the... room,

00:19:33,722 --> 00:19:36,825
I found her dead

00:19:36,892 --> 00:19:38,494
with a gun in her hand.

00:19:38,561 --> 00:19:39,628
And instead of calling
the police,

00:19:39,695 --> 00:19:41,363
you cleaned up the scene,
you took the gun

00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,465
and her cell phone,
and you went back to LA.

00:19:43,532 --> 00:19:46,001
Yes, because I knew
how bad it looked.

00:19:46,068 --> 00:19:47,002
(sniffles)

00:19:47,069 --> 00:19:48,470
Do you have
any idea...

00:19:48,537 --> 00:19:51,907
any idea at all how...
this makes me feel?

00:19:51,974 --> 00:19:54,710
To not know that my wife
was suicidal...

00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:56,111
my own wife!

00:19:56,178 --> 00:19:59,815
But I was too self-absorbed

00:19:59,882 --> 00:20:01,917
to even recognize her pain.

00:20:01,984 --> 00:20:04,787
Jena was the one

00:20:04,854 --> 00:20:07,489
real thing in my life.

00:20:07,556 --> 00:20:09,191
MICKEY (on voice mail):
Jena! Jena!

00:20:09,258 --> 00:20:11,126
You think I'm just
gonna let you play me

00:20:11,193 --> 00:20:13,529
like a bitch while you run off
with that piece of crap?

00:20:13,596 --> 00:20:16,332
You know me better than that,
you whore!

00:20:18,334 --> 00:20:19,435
See, you can ditch

00:20:19,501 --> 00:20:21,237
a gun,
you can toss a cell phone,

00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,471
but voice mails are forever.

00:20:22,538 --> 00:20:26,475
Even when you delete them
off your own phone, huh?

00:20:50,966 --> 00:20:52,368
VARTANN:
<i>She didn't kill herself,</i>
<i>Mickey.</i>

00:20:52,434 --> 00:20:53,903
<i>Give it up.</i>

00:20:53,969 --> 00:20:54,970
You're nailed.

00:20:55,037 --> 00:20:56,338
This is all because of Tripp.

00:20:56,405 --> 00:20:57,806
No, this is all because of you.

00:20:57,873 --> 00:21:00,376
Tripp Linson-- he's a producer
I met four years ago.

00:21:00,442 --> 00:21:03,412
He was gonna produce my comeback
feature, <i>Enemy of the People.</i>

00:21:03,479 --> 00:21:05,748
It was written up in <i>Variety,</i>
maybe you saw it.

00:21:05,814 --> 00:21:07,149
Come on, Mickey!

00:21:07,216 --> 00:21:09,084
This guy talks me out of 200 Gs

00:21:09,151 --> 00:21:11,053
to invest in
his little movie, okay?

00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,123
And then he talks his way
into my wife's pants.

00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,025
They become a thing.

00:21:16,091 --> 00:21:17,593
But I forgive her.

00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:20,396
Then a couple of days
ago, I go to the house,

00:21:20,462 --> 00:21:21,697
and I get this
little note.

00:21:21,764 --> 00:21:22,698
The note says,

00:21:22,765 --> 00:21:24,567
"We're done."

00:21:24,633 --> 00:21:27,269
She's gonna run off with Tripp.

00:21:27,336 --> 00:21:29,738
<i>So I check the credit card</i>
<i>company, find out where she is.</i>

00:21:29,805 --> 00:21:31,574
<i>I go to the motel,</i>
<i>and I find her.</i>

00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,276
She's in there, and she's
just crying her eyes out.

00:21:34,343 --> 00:21:37,746
She found Tripp, but he...

00:21:37,813 --> 00:21:40,549
the bastard pretended
he didn't even know who she was.

00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:45,287
Gareth cheered her up.
(sniffles)

00:21:45,354 --> 00:21:48,257
And then we... we recommitted
to each other.

00:21:48,324 --> 00:21:49,258
You recommitted?

00:21:49,325 --> 00:21:50,860
The ME called it rape-murder.

00:21:50,926 --> 00:21:53,829
Rather than be with me...

00:21:56,665 --> 00:21:59,034
...my wife killed herself.

00:21:59,101 --> 00:22:02,271
(sniffles):
This is our second chance.

00:22:02,338 --> 00:22:04,940
You and me, baby! Forever!

00:22:05,007 --> 00:22:07,009
(gunshot)

00:22:13,883 --> 00:22:15,985
VARTANN:
<i>That's a nice try, Mickey.</i>

00:22:16,051 --> 00:22:17,987
But when people
blow their brains out,

00:22:18,053 --> 00:22:19,855
they only pull the trigger once.

00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:21,123
Now, Jena...

00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:23,726
was shot twice.

00:22:23,792 --> 00:22:25,094
No, that's not possible.

00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,496
I was there--
I only heard one shot.

00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,769
One shot.

00:22:33,836 --> 00:22:35,204
SANDERS:
<i>Sometimes the gunpowder</i>

00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:36,839
<i>in old ammunition</i>
<i>doesn't burn completely.</i>

00:22:36,906 --> 00:22:39,341
<i>This results in shallow</i>
<i>rifling marks on the bullet,</i>

00:22:39,408 --> 00:22:41,310
<i>which only gets</i>
<i>partway down the barrel.</i>

00:22:41,377 --> 00:22:44,647
<i>If you don't realize what's</i>
<i>happened and you try again,</i>

00:22:44,713 --> 00:22:46,715
<i>the second bullet</i>
<i>impacts the first,</i>

00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,751
<i>leaving an indentation</i>
<i>in the base</i>

00:22:48,817 --> 00:22:51,287
<i>and forcing both bullets</i>
<i>out of the barrel.</i>

00:22:51,353 --> 00:22:54,123
And that... is how
you get a twofer.

00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:56,192
(shower running)

00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:08,404
MICKEY:
This is our second chance.

00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,673
(hammer cocks)

00:23:10,739 --> 00:23:12,041
You and me, baby!

00:23:12,107 --> 00:23:14,043
Forever!

00:23:14,109 --> 00:23:16,078
(gunshot)

00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:18,480
What do you know.

00:23:18,547 --> 00:23:21,116
Mickey Ross <i>was</i>
telling the truth.

00:23:23,085 --> 00:23:24,954
INTERVIEWER:
Tripp, can you
give us a second?

00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:25,955
Look, you know what you get


00:23:26,021 --> 00:23:27,122
when you have... you have


00:23:27,189 --> 00:23:28,657
the perfect actor in the perfect


00:23:28,724 --> 00:23:29,959
part in the perfect script?


00:23:30,025 --> 00:23:32,161
One word, dude: immortality.


00:23:32,228 --> 00:23:35,431
I'm not gonna even have to ask
Mickey to act-- this guy has

00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:36,432
lived this.


00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:37,800
Tripp Linson
is awesome.

00:23:37,867 --> 00:23:39,768
INTERVIEWER:
Jena, what have
you got there?

00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,804
(chuckles):
Not "what." Who.

00:23:41,871 --> 00:23:43,339
Say hello, Gareth.

00:23:43,405 --> 00:23:44,607
(chuckles)


00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,008
He's a gift.

00:23:46,075 --> 00:23:47,209
For Mickey.

00:23:47,276 --> 00:23:49,778
Um, slow and steady
wins the race, dude.


00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,180
We start filming this summer.


00:23:51,247 --> 00:23:53,415
Go see this movie.
You're never going to regret it.

00:23:53,482 --> 00:23:54,850
Ray, excuse me.

00:23:54,917 --> 00:23:56,485
Could you come in here
for a minute?

00:23:56,552 --> 00:23:58,153
You need to see this.

00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:01,090
It's a person of interest

00:24:01,156 --> 00:24:03,759
in that motel murder
I was working on.

00:24:03,826 --> 00:24:06,295
That looks like my 419,
Carsten Pennington.

00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:08,163
WILLOWS:
It is.

00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,965
And it isn't.

00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:12,902
Hey, do either one of
you recognize this
guy-- Ryan Morton?

00:24:12,968 --> 00:24:14,537
He kind of looks...

00:24:14,603 --> 00:24:16,605
familiar.

00:24:37,458 --> 00:24:39,860
(bones crack)
(grunts): Oh...

00:24:39,927 --> 00:24:42,730
I think I just
threw out my back.
Seriously?

00:24:42,797 --> 00:24:44,332
Oh...

00:24:44,398 --> 00:24:45,900
I'm good. (grunts)
(bones crack)

00:24:45,967 --> 00:24:47,368
STOKES:
No, no, come on out
of there, Super Dave.

00:24:47,435 --> 00:24:48,369
Take a break;
we'll get him.

00:24:48,436 --> 00:24:49,437
Jimmy, get him
out of there

00:24:49,503 --> 00:24:50,705
for me, will ya?

00:24:50,771 --> 00:24:52,006
You all right?
Yeah.

00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:54,275
(Phillips groans)

00:24:54,342 --> 00:24:56,477
STOKES:
Easy. There you go.

00:24:56,544 --> 00:24:58,613
ADAMS:
There's a body shoved under
the steering column.

00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:00,881
So, I think
it's safe to say

00:25:00,948 --> 00:25:03,451
somebody didn't want him
to be found.

00:25:03,517 --> 00:25:06,253
No shell casings,
no apparent blood.

00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,856
Phone.

00:25:08,923 --> 00:25:10,091
Did you get an ID on him?

00:25:10,157 --> 00:25:12,293
Here you go.

00:25:13,461 --> 00:25:15,830
His name's Shawn Hagan.

00:25:15,896 --> 00:25:19,133
He's a PI from Tahoe.

00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,302
(bone cracking)
Wow. Rigor is fully developed.

00:25:21,369 --> 00:25:24,805
Makes TOD at least
six to 12 hours ago.

00:25:24,872 --> 00:25:26,641
No petechial
hemorrhaging.

00:25:26,707 --> 00:25:29,777
And no bruising
on the neck.

00:25:29,844 --> 00:25:31,479
So maybe a heart attack?

00:25:31,545 --> 00:25:33,381
ADAMS:
Or an OD?

00:25:33,447 --> 00:25:35,950
But I don't see any
drug paraphernalia around here.

00:25:36,017 --> 00:25:38,219
The rental agreement

00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:41,489
said he picked up the car
four days ago in LA.

00:25:41,555 --> 00:25:43,157
Yeah, and it looks like
he was expensing it

00:25:43,224 --> 00:25:45,726
at $160 a day to a client.

00:25:45,793 --> 00:25:48,996
Well, if he bills clients
like that for heaps like these,

00:25:49,063 --> 00:25:51,198
we're gonna have
a lot of suspects.

00:25:53,034 --> 00:25:55,136
Lucky you were visiting
Vegas, Dr. Anton.

00:25:55,202 --> 00:25:57,104
What's your business
with Shawn Hagan?

00:25:57,171 --> 00:25:58,973
It's a personal matter.

00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,008
Why do you
want to know?

00:26:01,075 --> 00:26:04,378
Mr. Hagan's case files are
on their way down from Tahoe.

00:26:04,445 --> 00:26:07,415
So nothing's gonna remain
personal very long.

00:26:07,481 --> 00:26:11,419
Mr. Hagan is helping me find
a former business associate.

00:26:11,485 --> 00:26:12,520
That's personal?

00:26:12,586 --> 00:26:14,021
It's a private matter.

00:26:14,088 --> 00:26:16,190
Have a seat.

00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:20,861
Shawn Hagan was murdered
last night.

00:26:20,928 --> 00:26:22,596
(sighs)

00:26:22,663 --> 00:26:25,066
Where were you?

00:26:25,132 --> 00:26:27,802
In my hotel room, all night,

00:26:27,868 --> 00:26:29,170
watching movies.

00:26:29,236 --> 00:26:31,305
If Shawn Hagan is dead,

00:26:31,372 --> 00:26:33,474
Ryan Morton had
something to do with it.

00:26:33,541 --> 00:26:34,809
Let me guess,

00:26:34,875 --> 00:26:36,277
that would be your
business associate, right?

00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:38,546
You know where
we might find him?

00:26:38,613 --> 00:26:40,181
No.

00:26:40,247 --> 00:26:44,852
That's what Mr. Hagan
was supposed to find out.

00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:46,187
Here.

00:26:46,253 --> 00:26:48,356
That's as much as I know.

00:26:49,991 --> 00:26:52,126
I doubt it'll do
you any good.

00:26:55,863 --> 00:26:57,632
(bone cracking)

00:26:57,698 --> 00:27:00,468
This reminds me of David's back.

00:27:00,534 --> 00:27:02,203
(bone cracking)

00:27:02,269 --> 00:27:03,838
(loud thud)

00:27:07,041 --> 00:27:08,409
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:12,013
Hang on a second.

00:27:17,151 --> 00:27:19,520
Looks like a contact lens.

00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:25,526
He's not wearing
the other one.

00:27:25,593 --> 00:27:27,561
(blow lands)

00:27:27,628 --> 00:27:29,463
Could be from the killer.

00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:32,566
I'll get it to Wendy,
have her run the clothes

00:27:32,633 --> 00:27:33,834
for touch DNA as well.

00:27:33,901 --> 00:27:35,736
(bones cracking)

00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:45,179
Nick, this is a gunshot wound.

00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:46,814
Palm-side entry.

00:27:46,881 --> 00:27:49,550
Sooting says
that it's a contact wound.

00:27:49,617 --> 00:27:50,384
Through and through?

00:27:50,451 --> 00:27:52,653
Yeah.
Hmm.

00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,655
Then why didn't we find
the bullet anywhere?

00:27:54,722 --> 00:27:57,091
Or blood.

00:28:02,797 --> 00:28:04,765
(quietly):
Whew.

00:28:04,832 --> 00:28:07,969
ROBBINS: <i>Hagan grabs the gun</i>
<i>in the course of the struggle.</i>
(gunshot)

00:28:08,035 --> 00:28:10,738
<i>The bullet tracks along</i>
<i>the skin inside the sleeve,</i>

00:28:10,805 --> 00:28:13,107
<i>reenters the torso,</i>
<i>and deflects off a rib</i>

00:28:13,174 --> 00:28:15,509
<i>into both lungs,</i>
<i>then off another rib</i>

00:28:15,576 --> 00:28:16,978
<i>into the diaphragm...</i>

00:28:17,044 --> 00:28:19,347
<i>finally coming to rest</i>
<i>in the spleen.</i>

00:28:22,783 --> 00:28:24,719
Ballistic pinball.

00:28:24,785 --> 00:28:27,521
More or less.

00:28:27,588 --> 00:28:28,923
Hmm.

00:28:34,862 --> 00:28:36,964
Brass-washed .22.

00:28:37,031 --> 00:28:39,333
High-penetration round.

00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,269
Bullets sometimes take
a long and winding road

00:28:42,336 --> 00:28:44,972
before they reach
their ultimate destination.

00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:46,073
Some people, too.

00:28:52,613 --> 00:28:54,115
(typing)

00:28:55,283 --> 00:28:58,152
RYAN MORTON:
Lake Tahoe-- the Golden West.

00:28:58,219 --> 00:29:00,388
This is where fortunes are made.

00:29:00,454 --> 00:29:03,758
Hi. My name is Ryan Morton,
and I want to make you rich.

00:29:03,824 --> 00:29:06,827
This country was forged
by wildcat entrepreneurs

00:29:06,894 --> 00:29:09,964
who struck out across
an untamed continent

00:29:10,031 --> 00:29:12,967
to find mountains of timber
and rivers of gold.

00:29:13,034 --> 00:29:14,602
Those mother lodes

00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:18,172
are still out there waiting
for those who dare to dream.

00:29:18,239 --> 00:29:19,940
(dog barks, Morton chuckles)

00:29:20,007 --> 00:29:22,610
Looks like Gareth
thinks so, too.

00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:24,345
Your investment
in Royal Tahoe property

00:29:24,412 --> 00:29:28,416
can yield a 24% return,
or even higher.

00:29:28,482 --> 00:29:30,217
For a taste
of the frontier spirit

00:29:30,284 --> 00:29:33,721
that made America great,
give me a call.

00:29:35,856 --> 00:29:39,193
It's hard to believe people
actually fall for this crap.
I don't know.

00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,428
Have you ever known anyone

00:29:40,494 --> 00:29:42,330
to hit a royal flush
playing video poker?

00:29:42,396 --> 00:29:43,364
Oh, of course.
So...

00:29:43,431 --> 00:29:44,966
then it could happen
to you, right?

00:29:45,032 --> 00:29:47,335
(chuckles)
You know,

00:29:47,401 --> 00:29:49,603
there's something about this guy

00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:51,539
that looks familiar.

00:29:51,605 --> 00:29:53,207
Hey.

00:29:53,274 --> 00:29:56,143
Look what Sanitation turned up
in a Dumpster

00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:58,512
two blocks from Shawn Hagan's
murder scene.

00:29:58,579 --> 00:29:59,780
.22 caliber?
Yeah.

00:29:59,847 --> 00:30:01,349
Nice. Same as the bullet.

00:30:01,415 --> 00:30:03,484
Did you run ballistics?

00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:04,652
Oh, I will.

00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:06,220
But it's got a serial number.

00:30:06,287 --> 00:30:07,888
Guess who it's registered to.

00:30:07,955 --> 00:30:10,691
Ballistics
confirms <i>your</i> gun

00:30:10,758 --> 00:30:13,527
fired the bullet
that killed Shawn Hagan.

00:30:13,594 --> 00:30:17,164
This gun hasn't been
in my possession for years.

00:30:17,231 --> 00:30:18,966
So, what, you misplaced it?

00:30:19,033 --> 00:30:21,736
No. I gave it
to Ryan Morton.

00:30:21,802 --> 00:30:23,404
It was a gift.

00:30:23,471 --> 00:30:25,106
Can you prove that?

00:30:25,172 --> 00:30:27,008
No. Have you
found him yet?

00:30:27,074 --> 00:30:28,542
CAVALIERE:
We got a broadcast out.

00:30:28,609 --> 00:30:31,112
And he'll turn up.
Hagan said he found him.

00:30:31,178 --> 00:30:32,513
Here's what I think happened.

00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,583
I think Hagan told you
he found Ryan in Las Vegas,

00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:37,618
but then he decided
he wanted more money

00:30:37,685 --> 00:30:39,120
than you agreed upon
for delivery.

00:30:39,186 --> 00:30:41,455
So you arranged
to meet Hagan in his car,

00:30:41,522 --> 00:30:43,591
but you weren't gonna
be jerked around anymore.

00:30:43,658 --> 00:30:45,893
That's why you decided
to bring your gun.
No.

00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,961
CAVALIERE:
There's a struggle.

00:30:47,028 --> 00:30:48,696
He grabs the gun, and bam!

00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:51,132
I had nothing to do with that!
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

00:30:51,198 --> 00:30:53,301
We understand
that sometimes

00:30:53,367 --> 00:30:55,403
things just get out of control.

00:30:55,469 --> 00:30:57,338
But you need to be truthful.

00:30:57,405 --> 00:30:58,806
If you did not intend

00:30:58,873 --> 00:31:02,143
to shoot him...
I did not shoot him!

00:31:03,177 --> 00:31:05,746
Then you tell me what happened.

00:31:07,315 --> 00:31:09,250
(sighs)

00:31:09,317 --> 00:31:11,919
Look, I met Ryan...

00:31:11,986 --> 00:31:14,522
at a tennis club in Tahoe.

00:31:14,588 --> 00:31:19,994
He grew up in Tonopah,
not far from where I did.

00:31:20,061 --> 00:31:24,398
He was developing
a lot of real estate.

00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:27,134
He was very ambitious.

00:31:27,201 --> 00:31:30,805
I lost my boy years
ago in a divorce,

00:31:30,871 --> 00:31:34,275
and Ryan told me that his
father had abandoned his family

00:31:34,342 --> 00:31:36,344
before he was born.

00:31:38,879 --> 00:31:41,182
I gave him the gun
for his birthday.

00:31:41,248 --> 00:31:44,485
And then he got you
to give him some <i>real</i> money.

00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,022
(chuckles)

00:31:48,089 --> 00:31:51,092
He said he needed
a completion loan

00:31:51,158 --> 00:31:53,694
for a house he was gonna flip.

00:31:53,761 --> 00:31:56,530
$175,000.

00:31:56,597 --> 00:31:58,466
And I find out one day

00:31:58,532 --> 00:32:01,202
he left town.

00:32:01,268 --> 00:32:04,005
Didn't even have
a title to the house.

00:32:04,071 --> 00:32:05,806
Why didn't you go to the police?

00:32:05,873 --> 00:32:07,675
I'm a cardiac surgeon.

00:32:07,742 --> 00:32:09,644
My patients, my staff--

00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:11,812
they have to have
confidence in my judgment.

00:32:11,879 --> 00:32:15,216
If they'd heard that
I've been played like a rube...

00:32:15,283 --> 00:32:16,617
Do you wear contact lenses?

00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:17,985
Yes. Why?

00:32:18,052 --> 00:32:19,487
DNA sample.

00:32:19,553 --> 00:32:21,055
I'm gonna need one.

00:32:22,556 --> 00:32:25,192
Take whatever you need.

00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:29,897
WILLOWS:
Ray, excuse me.

00:32:29,964 --> 00:32:31,899
Could you come in here
for a minute?

00:32:31,966 --> 00:32:33,968
You need to see this.

00:32:35,469 --> 00:32:37,071
It's a person of interest

00:32:37,138 --> 00:32:39,140
in that motel murder
I was working on.

00:32:39,206 --> 00:32:41,542
LANGSTON:
That looks like my 419,
Carsten Pennington.

00:32:41,609 --> 00:32:43,644
WILLOWS:
It is. And it isn't.

00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:45,947
STOKES: Hey, do either one of
you recognize this guy--

00:32:46,013 --> 00:32:47,281
Ryan Morton?

00:32:47,348 --> 00:32:49,684
(beeping)

00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,352
Hey, Nick.
Yeah?

00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:53,187
The DNA from the doctor
didn't match the sample

00:32:53,254 --> 00:32:55,589
from the contact lens, and
then CODIS drew a blank,

00:32:55,656 --> 00:32:56,791
so just to be thorough,

00:32:56,857 --> 00:32:58,359
I ran it against
all the other case profiles.

00:32:58,426 --> 00:33:00,227
And you got a match?
I got a sibling match.

00:33:00,294 --> 00:33:03,230
That contact lens DNA had
seven alleles in common

00:33:03,297 --> 00:33:05,099
with Carsten Pennington.

00:33:05,166 --> 00:33:07,535
AKA Tripp Linson.

00:33:07,601 --> 00:33:08,869
AKA Ryan Morton.

00:33:08,936 --> 00:33:10,071
He's got a brother.

00:33:10,137 --> 00:33:12,106
Who just might be our killer.

00:33:14,708 --> 00:33:16,443
WILLOWS: Gareth Morton?
The brother's name
is Gareth?

00:33:16,509 --> 00:33:17,610
Yes, like the cat.

00:33:17,677 --> 00:33:18,545
And the tortoise.

00:33:18,611 --> 00:33:20,046
And the dog.

00:33:20,113 --> 00:33:21,514
(sighs)

00:33:21,581 --> 00:33:22,849
Some people.

00:33:22,916 --> 00:33:24,985
It's no surprise
when they end up dead.

00:33:25,051 --> 00:33:27,053
We checked the local records
in Tonopah.

00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,888
Ryan and Gareth
Morton own a house

00:33:28,955 --> 00:33:30,056
that was left to them

00:33:30,123 --> 00:33:31,591
by their mother.

00:33:31,658 --> 00:33:33,126
We tried to contact Gareth
there.

00:33:33,193 --> 00:33:35,628
No answer.
Local PD couldn't find him.

00:33:35,695 --> 00:33:37,564
I had Archie
go back over the surveillance

00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:40,066
at Carsten's
cocktail party

00:33:40,133 --> 00:33:42,702
and guess what?

00:33:42,769 --> 00:33:45,472
We found Gareth.

00:33:51,511 --> 00:33:54,147
That places Gareth
in Las Vegas the night

00:33:54,214 --> 00:33:55,749
of Carsten's murder.

00:33:55,815 --> 00:33:57,384
(sighs):
Okay.

00:33:57,450 --> 00:33:59,386
WILLOWS:
Quick timeline...

00:33:59,452 --> 00:34:01,554
Jena Makin

00:34:01,621 --> 00:34:03,256
sees her old flame Tripp

00:34:03,323 --> 00:34:04,924
in a Vegas magazine.

00:34:04,991 --> 00:34:07,594
She makes a last-ditch attempt
for love.

00:34:07,661 --> 00:34:11,164
She finds Tripp
and throws herself at him.

00:34:11,231 --> 00:34:13,400
LANGSTON:
Unfortunately,
he's not Tripp anymore.

00:34:13,466 --> 00:34:14,801
<i>He's Carsten Pennington,</i>
<i>art dealer,</i>

00:34:14,868 --> 00:34:16,336
<i>living in a rented mansion,</i>

00:34:16,403 --> 00:34:18,705
so he claims
he doesn't recognize her.

00:34:18,772 --> 00:34:20,940
And Jena goes back to the motel

00:34:21,007 --> 00:34:23,576
<i>and blows her brains out.</i>

00:34:23,643 --> 00:34:25,578
STOKES:
A day later, a PI tracking down

00:34:25,645 --> 00:34:27,514
real estate fraudster
Ryan Morton

00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:30,450
meets his brother Gareth and

00:34:30,517 --> 00:34:32,452
<i>probably by accident,</i>

00:34:32,519 --> 00:34:34,421
Gareth kills the
PI in his car.

00:34:34,487 --> 00:34:36,389
Then, later that night,

00:34:36,456 --> 00:34:38,391
Gareth shows up
at Carsten's party--

00:34:38,458 --> 00:34:40,427
uninvited, no doubt--

00:34:40,493 --> 00:34:41,861
<i>smashes his head in,</i>

00:34:41,928 --> 00:34:43,897
<i>dumps him in the pool.</i>

00:34:43,963 --> 00:34:45,432
And brother Gareth's
in the wind.

00:34:45,498 --> 00:34:48,034
His description's
out on broadcast.
(phone beeping)

00:34:48,101 --> 00:34:50,470
But right now, that's
about all we can do.
If he's smart,

00:34:50,537 --> 00:34:53,773
he's not in the country.

00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,409
Apparently, he's not that smart.

00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:03,717
Speeding, Gareth,
is a crime.

00:35:03,783 --> 00:35:05,785
And when you have
a bench warrant

00:35:05,852 --> 00:35:07,587
for a couple
unpaid parking tickets,

00:35:07,654 --> 00:35:11,324
that gets you a couple of
days lockup in Pahrump.

00:35:11,391 --> 00:35:13,259
What do you think
this gets you?

00:35:13,326 --> 00:35:14,661
Check this out.

00:35:14,728 --> 00:35:16,096
Look closely.

00:35:16,162 --> 00:35:19,299
That's your contact lens.

00:35:19,366 --> 00:35:23,603
That's your DNA
on a dead guy.

00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:26,139
Want to tell me
how it got there?

00:35:26,206 --> 00:35:29,609
Hagan came to see me
in Tonopah,

00:35:29,676 --> 00:35:31,778
four days ago.

00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,848
He slapped me.

00:35:34,914 --> 00:35:37,250
Now, why would he go and do
a mean thing like that?

00:35:37,317 --> 00:35:39,452
'Cause he wanted 175K

00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:41,755
that Ryan stole
from his client.

00:35:41,821 --> 00:35:46,126
I-I told Hagan I hadn't
heard from Ryan in years.

00:35:46,192 --> 00:35:48,361
That his debts
weren't my problem.

00:35:48,428 --> 00:35:50,030
Hmm.

00:35:50,096 --> 00:35:53,667
And he said, oh, well,
they were now

00:35:53,733 --> 00:35:56,336
because Ma left him
half of the house.

00:35:56,403 --> 00:35:58,638
They put a lien on it.

00:35:58,705 --> 00:36:01,908
He told me that Ryan
was living in Vegas

00:36:01,975 --> 00:36:05,045
under the name
Carsten Pennington,

00:36:05,111 --> 00:36:07,881
and he was living
in a mansion

00:36:07,947 --> 00:36:10,150
and rolling in dough.

00:36:10,216 --> 00:36:12,652
So, there you are, sitting
up in a shack in Tonopah,

00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:14,020
in a house you don't even own

00:36:14,087 --> 00:36:16,222
free and clear because of
your brother and Mr. Hagan.

00:36:16,289 --> 00:36:18,325
That must have chapped
your ass, huh?

00:36:18,391 --> 00:36:21,461
Yeah, that house
should have been mine.

00:36:21,528 --> 00:36:25,065
31 years I lived in that house
with Ma.

00:36:25,131 --> 00:36:28,468
Hauled her to church,

00:36:28,535 --> 00:36:30,170
to the beauty parlor,

00:36:30,236 --> 00:36:33,907
even changed her diapers
in the end.

00:36:36,276 --> 00:36:38,278
And all she ever talked about
was Ryan.

00:36:38,345 --> 00:36:39,546
Sure, okay.

00:36:39,612 --> 00:36:41,681
So you left for Vegas,
you know, with the

00:36:41,748 --> 00:36:44,184
"Mom always loved you
best" rage, right?

00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:46,219
Then what? You found
Hagan and killed him?

00:36:46,286 --> 00:36:48,822
I didn't kill Hagan.

00:36:48,888 --> 00:36:51,191
Look, I went to see Ryan.

00:36:51,257 --> 00:36:54,494
I hung outside his-his party

00:36:54,561 --> 00:36:56,429
until all the other guests
had left,

00:36:56,496 --> 00:36:59,366
and then I asked him
to quitclaim the house to me.

00:36:59,432 --> 00:37:01,101
Why the hell should I?

00:37:01,167 --> 00:37:02,736
Mom wanted me
to have half.

00:37:02,802 --> 00:37:04,337
I'm not gonna deny
her dying wish.

00:37:04,404 --> 00:37:06,506
You never gave a
rat's ass about her.

00:37:06,573 --> 00:37:08,608
Every-every birthday,
every Christmas

00:37:08,675 --> 00:37:12,012
she was waiting for a card
or a phone call or something.

00:37:12,078 --> 00:37:13,613
And never, not one
word from you.

00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,783
And still, you were all
she was thinking about.

00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:18,284
So I'm supposed
to feel guilty

00:37:18,351 --> 00:37:21,087
because you decided to chain
yourself to that sadistic bitch?

00:37:21,154 --> 00:37:24,457
After all the things
she did to us?

00:37:24,524 --> 00:37:26,926
You want to know
why I was her favorite?

00:37:26,993 --> 00:37:29,262
Because I had the guts
to get out.

00:37:29,329 --> 00:37:31,264
To live my own life.

00:37:31,331 --> 00:37:33,433
Hell, I've lived
five lives.

00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,769
You didn't have the guts
to live one.

00:37:35,835 --> 00:37:37,737
Then what?

00:37:37,804 --> 00:37:40,573
And then... I left.

00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,109
You left?
You just walked away?

00:37:43,176 --> 00:37:44,544
Why?

00:37:44,611 --> 00:37:46,746
Because he was right about me--
I'm weak.

00:37:46,813 --> 00:37:48,915
What do you mean?

00:37:49,949 --> 00:37:52,819
When we were growing up,
you know,

00:37:52,886 --> 00:37:56,690
all the kids in the neighborhood
crowded around him, and...

00:37:58,925 --> 00:38:01,528
...I just faded into his shadow.

00:38:03,763 --> 00:38:06,499
He had this charisma.

00:38:10,437 --> 00:38:14,574
He was electric.

00:38:14,641 --> 00:38:16,276
And even after all this
went down,

00:38:16,343 --> 00:38:19,145
I still... I still loved him.

00:38:23,249 --> 00:38:28,388
I just didn't have the courage
to tell him.

00:38:28,455 --> 00:38:30,290
(camera shutter clicking)

00:38:30,357 --> 00:38:31,658
Isn't this sweet?

00:38:31,725 --> 00:38:34,961
He drives Mommy's old Cutlass
to go commit murder.

00:38:35,028 --> 00:38:38,298
Okay, this is everything
Gareth had on him

00:38:38,365 --> 00:38:41,134
or with him at the time
he was arrested.

00:38:49,175 --> 00:38:50,744
One contact lens missing.

00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:53,713
That's bad news for Gareth.

00:39:10,997 --> 00:39:13,366
What do we have here?

00:39:13,433 --> 00:39:15,669
This is about a hundred grand.

00:39:15,735 --> 00:39:18,672
Maybe he figures a car trunk
is safer than a 401(k).

00:39:18,738 --> 00:39:20,874
These days, he's probably right.

00:39:41,961 --> 00:39:43,630
These are Burberrys.

00:39:43,697 --> 00:39:47,300
Everything else here is from
Dempsey's bargain basement.

00:39:47,367 --> 00:39:49,502
What's a half-broke kid
from Tonopah

00:39:49,569 --> 00:39:51,371
doing in a $50 pair
of underwear?

00:39:51,438 --> 00:39:54,274
LANGSTON:
I think I can answer that.

00:39:54,341 --> 00:39:56,543
Because the body we fished out
of Carsten Pennington's pool

00:39:56,609 --> 00:39:59,646
was wearing Dempsey's underwear.

00:39:59,713 --> 00:40:02,182
BRASS:
We found a hundred
grand in your car.

00:40:02,248 --> 00:40:04,584
Ryan gave it to me.

00:40:04,651 --> 00:40:07,754
Why didn't you
tell us about it?

00:40:07,821 --> 00:40:09,756
Taxes.

00:40:09,823 --> 00:40:11,958
I didn't want
to pay taxes on it.

00:40:12,025 --> 00:40:13,426
I'm sure Ryan didn't.

00:40:13,493 --> 00:40:15,328
Ryan wouldn't sign a
quitclaim for the house,

00:40:15,395 --> 00:40:17,931
and he gives you $100,000
free and clear?

00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:21,067
That sounds a tad inconsistent.

00:40:21,134 --> 00:40:23,937
Look, I don't pretend to
understand my brother.

00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:25,338
All right?

00:40:25,405 --> 00:40:28,341
But why-why would I kill him
when he gave me that money?

00:40:28,408 --> 00:40:29,843
Look, all brothers fight.

00:40:29,909 --> 00:40:31,378
I threw my brother
through a screen door.

00:40:31,444 --> 00:40:33,947
He broke a bowl of oatmeal
on my head.

00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:36,182
But I can't
imagine killing him.

00:40:36,249 --> 00:40:37,617
So, help me understand.

00:40:37,684 --> 00:40:40,286
I think this thing started
in the house in Tonopah,

00:40:40,353 --> 00:40:42,455
and ended
in that swimming pool.

00:40:42,522 --> 00:40:44,891
He's going to go down
for this, Darcy.

00:40:46,993 --> 00:40:50,664
The only question is, are you
going to go down with him?

00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:52,966
If I were you,
I would take a hard look

00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:55,001
at that bimbo of his.

00:40:55,068 --> 00:40:58,505
What's her name, Darcy?

00:40:58,571 --> 00:41:01,207
When Ryan gave me the
cash, she freaked out.

00:41:01,274 --> 00:41:03,543
She was really pissed,

00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:05,912
and there was murder
in her eyes.

00:41:05,979 --> 00:41:08,815
You guys should
check her out.

00:41:08,882 --> 00:41:11,117
That's not Gareth.

00:41:11,184 --> 00:41:12,619
It's Carsten.

00:41:12,686 --> 00:41:14,487
GARETH:
Every Christmas
and birthday

00:41:14,554 --> 00:41:17,190
she'd wait for a card
or a phone call, something.

00:41:17,257 --> 00:41:18,224
Not one word, ever.

00:41:18,291 --> 00:41:19,626
And still... you were all

00:41:19,693 --> 00:41:21,227
she thought about
at the end.

00:41:21,294 --> 00:41:22,696
I said shut up!

00:41:22,762 --> 00:41:24,431
(loud thud)

00:41:30,937 --> 00:41:32,238
Carsten?

00:41:33,707 --> 00:41:35,342
(grunting)

00:41:35,408 --> 00:41:39,479
DARCY:
<i>He said that Gareth threatened</i>
<i>to kill us both.</i>

00:41:39,546 --> 00:41:42,515
<i>That there was</i>
<i>no other way out.</i>

00:41:45,418 --> 00:41:48,555
<i>He took Gareth's identity</i>

00:41:48,621 --> 00:41:50,523
<i>and said he'd come back for me.</i>

00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:53,626
And I believed him.

00:42:02,202 --> 00:42:06,172
It's not true
what my brother says about me.

00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:09,943
I tried to make amends,
but he wouldn't let me.

00:42:14,214 --> 00:42:15,448
Here, Ma.

00:42:15,515 --> 00:42:18,652
I want you
to have this.

00:42:18,718 --> 00:42:20,987
Ryan, I can't.

00:42:22,989 --> 00:42:24,658
What the hell is that?

00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:28,128
We don't need your help.

00:42:28,194 --> 00:42:30,363
We're getting by just fine.

00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:33,066
What, on your-your lousy, uh,
$450 a week?

00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:34,901
You're lucky Mom's here,
or I'd...

00:42:34,968 --> 00:42:37,103
What?
Boys, don't fight.

00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:39,606
You haven't changed a bit.

00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,975
Don't forget
your money.

00:42:42,042 --> 00:42:43,910
You need it
more than us.

00:42:43,977 --> 00:42:46,179
It's the, uh... only thing
you ever loved.

00:42:52,686 --> 00:42:55,221
BRASS:
<i>Wow...</i>

00:42:55,288 --> 00:42:59,759
That is so... sad.

00:42:59,826 --> 00:43:03,330
What old movie
did you steal it from?

00:43:05,999 --> 00:43:08,968
Well, you're just one lie
wrapped in another, huh?

00:43:09,035 --> 00:43:12,305
It's the truth.

00:43:16,609 --> 00:43:18,945
Even if it never happened.
