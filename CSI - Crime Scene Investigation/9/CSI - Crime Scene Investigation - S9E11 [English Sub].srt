00:02:57,725 --> 00:02:58,926
they completely
cleaned that out.

00:02:58,993 --> 00:03:02,863
They didn't even bother
to ransack the place.

00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:05,433
Just went straight
for the good stuff.

00:03:31,325 --> 00:03:33,794

ring was in there,

00:03:36,197 --> 00:03:37,999

Write down everything
that was stolen

00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:46,073

form back to us.

00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,442
Be sure and keep a copy
for your insurance, okay?

00:03:48,509 --> 00:03:49,510
Okay.

00:03:59,186 --> 00:04:01,589
What'd you do,
try to use all of 'em?

00:04:01,656 --> 00:04:03,624
In the field, you really
only need three powders:

00:04:03,691 --> 00:04:05,526
black, magnetic,
and dragon's blood.

00:04:05,593 --> 00:04:07,595
If you can't get a print
off one of those,

00:04:07,662 --> 00:04:09,964
you're better off just taking it
back to the lab.

00:04:10,031 --> 00:04:11,699
It just kept breaking up.

00:04:11,766 --> 00:04:14,335
All right.

Now, don't do this if
you ever need touch DNA,

00:04:22,543 --> 00:04:24,412
but in a pinch...

00:04:28,082 --> 00:04:30,017
The water vapor
from your breath

00:04:30,084 --> 00:04:32,753
will adhere to the salt
and lipids in a latent print.

00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,556
It revitalizes it.

00:04:35,623 --> 00:04:37,291
(exhales)

00:04:37,358 --> 00:04:39,293
Then you take a little dust--

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,462
just a little.

00:04:43,597 --> 00:04:45,599
Gently.

00:04:50,938 --> 00:04:52,940
It's all in the wrist.

00:04:54,975 --> 00:04:57,578
A colleague of mine once told me

00:04:57,645 --> 00:04:59,447
if I found myself
in this part of town,

00:04:59,513 --> 00:05:01,716
I should drive very fast.

00:05:01,782 --> 00:05:03,050
Well, that's pretty good advice.

00:05:03,117 --> 00:05:05,886
We get about half a dozen calls
out here a week.

00:05:05,953 --> 00:05:07,755
There is a little
no-tell motel

00:05:07,822 --> 00:05:09,190
around here somewhere.

00:05:09,256 --> 00:05:10,658
We found a corpse
underneath a bed.

00:05:10,725 --> 00:05:12,593
It'd been there
for about four days.

00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,861
(chuckles)
People just went

00:05:13,928 --> 00:05:15,696
right on using the room

00:05:15,763 --> 00:05:17,431
till it was too ripe
to ignore.

00:05:17,498 --> 00:05:20,001
Did you catch
the guy who did it?

00:05:20,067 --> 00:05:22,203
Yeah, yeah, we did eventually.

00:05:22,269 --> 00:05:24,038
Then that's a good story.

00:05:25,506 --> 00:05:27,441
Dispatch,

00:05:27,508 --> 00:05:30,478
Charlie 0-5 Stokes

402-419 Sunrise Mountain.

00:05:36,283 --> 00:05:38,252
How's the first day of school
going, Professor?

00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:41,055
I'll, uh, tell
you at recess.

00:05:47,161 --> 00:05:51,332
The arson investigator
ran dogs through the scene.

00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:53,300
They didn't find
any accelerant.

00:05:53,367 --> 00:05:56,704
STOKES:
Doesn't rule out arson.

00:05:56,771 --> 00:05:59,874
What's with the construction
equipment out front?

00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,309
Were the owners
remodeling or something?

00:06:02,376 --> 00:06:05,680
Well, the place belongs
to Don and Paulla Kingsley.

00:06:06,681 --> 00:06:09,216
They live here alone.

00:06:10,217 --> 00:06:12,687
I got a call out
to both of them.

00:06:13,688 --> 00:06:15,756
I bet only one of them
calls me back.

00:07:25,769 --> 00:07:27,704
He asked me

to the research station
in Costa Rica, and...

00:07:31,007 --> 00:07:33,543
the rest is just going
into storage at his place.

00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:37,547
Hmm, so he didn't sell
his home?

00:07:37,614 --> 00:07:39,249
A condo in Vegas?

00:07:41,184 --> 00:07:44,120
Yeah, tell me about it.

00:07:44,187 --> 00:07:46,122
Well, you got a blank canvas.

00:07:46,189 --> 00:07:47,591
You're senior supervisor.

00:07:47,657 --> 00:07:49,226
It's your office now.

00:07:49,292 --> 00:07:51,027
Oh, I like the one I have.

00:07:51,094 --> 00:07:52,762
Catherine,
if you don't want it, fine.

00:07:52,829 --> 00:07:54,497
But you can't leave it empty,
all right?

00:07:54,564 --> 00:07:56,800
We don't have the space
for a shrine.

00:08:09,646 --> 00:08:11,214
Paulla Kingsley?
It's gone.

00:08:11,281 --> 00:08:12,649
It's all gone.

00:08:14,918 --> 00:08:16,152
Paulla Kingsley?

00:08:16,219 --> 00:08:19,022
I'm Mrs. Kingsley's
assistant Carla Banks.

00:08:19,089 --> 00:08:20,457
I didn't want her
to drive herself.

00:08:20,524 --> 00:08:22,592
I need Don.
W-Where's Don?

00:08:22,659 --> 00:08:24,427
We're not sure, ma'am.

00:08:24,494 --> 00:08:26,396
He's, he's not--
Was he inside?

00:08:26,463 --> 00:08:27,397
We found
someone inside.

00:08:27,464 --> 00:08:28,398
It's going to
take a while

00:08:28,465 --> 00:08:30,300
before we find
out who that is.

00:08:30,367 --> 00:08:32,068
Mrs. Kingsley, I'm Detective
Jim Brass, Las Vegas Police.

00:08:32,135 --> 00:08:33,837
Do you mind if I
ask you a question?

00:08:33,904 --> 00:08:34,871
According to the
fire department,

00:08:34,938 --> 00:08:36,172
this isn't their
first time out here.

00:08:36,239 --> 00:08:38,808
You called 911
about six weeks ago

00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:40,410
when your husband overdosed
on secobarbital.

00:08:40,477 --> 00:08:43,346
Is that right?
(sobbing):
Oh, my God.

00:08:43,413 --> 00:08:44,648
Don.

00:08:57,194 --> 00:08:59,129
This looks like it was
the laundry room.

00:08:59,196 --> 00:09:05,468
Everything's
displaced outward...

00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,737
from this point.

00:09:07,804 --> 00:09:11,408
Blast originated here.

00:09:13,543 --> 00:09:16,012
Sooting indicates
that the water heater inlet

00:09:16,079 --> 00:09:18,014
was unhooked during the fire.

00:09:18,081 --> 00:09:20,250
Maybe it was torn off
by the blast.

00:09:20,317 --> 00:09:21,952
If that were the case,
these threads

00:09:22,018 --> 00:09:23,453
would be stripped
and they're not.

00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:27,991
That's the natural gas line
hookup right there.

00:09:28,058 --> 00:09:29,125
See if that valve's

00:09:29,192 --> 00:09:31,561
open or closed
for me, would you?

00:09:33,029 --> 00:09:34,664
It's open.

00:09:34,731 --> 00:09:37,901
If at first
you don't succeed...

00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,842
(hissing)

00:09:47,911 --> 00:09:49,512
BRASS: So would you say
that Don Kingsley

00:09:49,579 --> 00:09:52,115
was having
emotional problems?

00:09:52,182 --> 00:09:53,283
Yeah, Mr. Kingsley
was depressed.

00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,452
They'd been having
some difficulties.

00:09:55,518 --> 00:09:56,953
What kind of difficulties?

00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:59,189
Financial.

00:09:59,256 --> 00:10:01,157
Where was Mrs. Kingsley
last night?

00:10:01,224 --> 00:10:02,759
At the gym.

00:10:02,826 --> 00:10:04,828
Buff &amp;amp;amp; Tuff Fitness Center.
Well, the fire started

00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:05,929
just after midnight.

00:10:05,996 --> 00:10:07,397
Does she usually work
out that late?

00:10:07,464 --> 00:10:08,865
No. She owns the franchise.

00:10:08,932 --> 00:10:11,735
Six locations across Vegas.
Open 24/7.

00:10:11,801 --> 00:10:13,103
So we're going to
need the name

00:10:13,169 --> 00:10:14,271
of Mr. Kingsley's dentist.

00:10:14,337 --> 00:10:15,572
Can you help me with that?

00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:18,341
Yeah, sure.

00:10:18,408 --> 00:10:21,244
LANGSTON:
Aren't we required to
run DNA on the victim?

00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:23,647
No. We're only required
to confirm I.D.

00:10:23,713 --> 00:10:26,216
Fires sometimes destroy
known exemplars.

00:10:26,283 --> 00:10:28,385
Dental records are
just quicker.

00:10:29,619 --> 00:10:31,388
Boy, I bet you've never seen
one of those

00:10:31,454 --> 00:10:33,523
in the hospital
before, huh?

00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:35,358
Once.
He was still screaming.

00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,962
PHILLIPS:
Okay, we're ready.

00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:42,666
Now remember,
lift with your legs.

00:10:42,732 --> 00:10:44,834
On three.

00:10:44,901 --> 00:10:47,604
One, two, three.

00:10:47,671 --> 00:10:49,673
(flesh crackling, body thuds)

00:10:51,575 --> 00:10:53,143
(coughs)

00:10:54,311 --> 00:10:55,679
Here you go.
I'll take that.

00:10:55,745 --> 00:10:57,180
(coughs)

00:10:57,247 --> 00:10:58,315
PHILLIPS:
You okay?

00:10:58,381 --> 00:10:59,816
I'm fine.

00:10:59,883 --> 00:11:00,817
Again?

00:11:00,884 --> 00:11:02,485
Let's go.

00:11:02,552 --> 00:11:06,256
One, two, three.

00:11:06,323 --> 00:11:09,960
Whoa, the bones
feel... crumbly.

00:11:10,026 --> 00:11:13,230
Like they were...
(groans) shattered.

00:11:13,296 --> 00:11:16,633
That's what happens when
they're in the oven too long.

00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,235
Uh...

00:11:22,205 --> 00:11:24,040
What should we do about that?

00:11:24,107 --> 00:11:27,377
It could have trace
from the body?

00:11:27,444 --> 00:11:28,645
Yes, sir.

00:11:28,712 --> 00:11:30,180
It's evidence?

00:11:33,016 --> 00:11:36,353
Do you have a pair of scissors
I could borrow?

00:11:43,393 --> 00:11:45,262
Thanks.

00:12:15,992 --> 00:12:18,962
Excuse me.

00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:21,665
David Hodges, right?

00:12:21,731 --> 00:12:23,366
I need to, um...

00:12:23,433 --> 00:12:26,503
You need to log that in
with the evidence clerk first.

00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:28,004
And then he will
distribute it

00:12:28,071 --> 00:12:30,173
to the appropriate lab.

00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,943
Right-- the evidence
clerk isn't there.

00:12:33,009 --> 00:12:35,478
Yeah, he never is.

00:12:35,545 --> 00:12:38,081
And that's your problem.

00:12:46,256 --> 00:12:49,259
Okay... fine.

00:12:49,326 --> 00:12:52,262
So, now, I'll do <i>his</i> job.

00:13:04,274 --> 00:13:06,276
(Hodges clears throat)

00:13:10,413 --> 00:13:11,715
May I help you?

00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:15,619
Just check it in.

00:13:16,653 --> 00:13:19,422
Fill out this form.

00:13:26,329 --> 00:13:28,865
Well, you certainly
have a doctor's handwriting.

00:13:28,932 --> 00:13:30,834
Next time, print.

00:13:30,901 --> 00:13:32,068
There you are, Professor.

00:13:32,135 --> 00:13:35,705
Nick stuck me
with your 406.

00:13:35,772 --> 00:13:37,741
Doesn't get you off of it.

00:13:37,807 --> 00:13:40,577
I'll meet you in the A.V. Lab.

00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:45,982
The laptop on the
stolen property list

00:13:46,049 --> 00:13:48,184
has a cell phone
card in it with G.P.S.

00:13:48,251 --> 00:13:50,887
That means we can track it.

00:13:50,954 --> 00:13:52,389
Yeah, well, we are in luck.

00:13:52,455 --> 00:13:55,692
This laptop's on
a mesh network right now.

00:13:58,395 --> 00:13:59,896
You bought my book.

00:14:00,931 --> 00:14:02,799
Yeah.

00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:05,168
Did you read it?

00:14:07,204 --> 00:14:09,539
Yeah.

00:14:09,606 --> 00:14:13,143
Guess that makes you
one of the few.

00:14:15,178 --> 00:14:17,247
(computer beeps)

00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:19,749
ARCHIE:
I got an address.

00:14:33,129 --> 00:14:35,799
If you're looking for drugs,
you're not going to find any.

00:14:35,866 --> 00:14:37,167
My son's not into that stuff.

00:14:37,234 --> 00:14:38,535
Right, Alex?

00:14:38,602 --> 00:14:41,638
ADAMS: We're not looking
for drugs, sir.

00:14:45,275 --> 00:14:48,478
(Wi-Fi detector beeping)

00:14:51,681 --> 00:14:53,783
Mr. Palento, what's back here?

00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:57,420
His bedroom.

00:15:06,129 --> 00:15:09,232
(detector beeping faster)

00:15:11,668 --> 00:15:13,937
(beeping rapidly,
then stops)

00:15:26,116 --> 00:15:28,885
Yes, it's on the list.

00:15:28,952 --> 00:15:31,288
Where'd it come from?

00:15:31,354 --> 00:15:32,756
I don't know;
I found it.
Where?

00:15:32,822 --> 00:15:35,058
I can't remember exactly.
Oh.

00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:37,894
Alex, if you're
screwing with me,

00:15:37,961 --> 00:15:39,930
you're in serious trouble.

00:15:45,502 --> 00:15:47,037
You find these things, too?

00:15:47,103 --> 00:15:49,172
Some kids in the neighborhood.

00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:50,707
They gave them to me.

00:15:50,774 --> 00:15:52,809
Like who?

00:15:52,876 --> 00:15:54,678
I can't remember.

00:15:55,745 --> 00:15:58,081
Your son could easily
be going out at night

00:15:58,148 --> 00:16:00,717
and having other people come
in without your knowledge.

00:16:00,784 --> 00:16:02,285
No, no, no, I keep that
alley gate locked.

00:16:02,352 --> 00:16:03,453
He doesn't have a key.

00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,487
Where'd you get that stuff?

00:16:04,554 --> 00:16:06,256
What difference does it make?

00:16:06,323 --> 00:16:07,824
That's not an answer!
LANGSTON:
Hey.

00:16:07,891 --> 00:16:09,726
That's not necessary.

00:16:09,793 --> 00:16:11,761
Oh, you don't approve?
As a matter of fact, I don't.

00:16:13,396 --> 00:16:14,764
Do you have any idea
what it's like

00:16:14,831 --> 00:16:16,066
to be a single father
in this town?

00:16:16,132 --> 00:16:18,268
I got two friends who had
their kids O.D. on them.

00:16:18,335 --> 00:16:20,070
Don't you tell me
how to handle my son.

00:16:20,136 --> 00:16:22,072
We wouldn't
dream of it, sir.

00:16:22,138 --> 00:16:24,708
ADAMS: I apologize
if we overstepped.

00:16:24,774 --> 00:16:26,142
MR. PALENTO:
Come on.

00:16:27,777 --> 00:16:28,879
In the house.
I'm not done...

00:16:28,945 --> 00:16:30,413
(door closes)

00:16:33,116 --> 00:16:34,684
What, it's not our job
to protect him?

00:16:34,751 --> 00:16:36,920
His father let us in here
without a warrant,

00:16:36,987 --> 00:16:38,521
and he wasn't
breaking any laws.

00:16:38,588 --> 00:16:39,823
We're here to
collect evidence.

00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:42,158
We're not social workers.

00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:13,290
You see the "Ma..."?

00:17:13,356 --> 00:17:15,525
My guess is the glass
came from a Mason jar.

00:17:15,592 --> 00:17:18,862
My wife uses them
to make fruit preserves.

00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:22,732
Oh, well, I doubt this guy
was canning explosive peaches.

00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,102
I hope I haven't missed
all the fun stuff.

00:17:26,169 --> 00:17:27,270
Hello, Doctor.

00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:29,039
My name is--
Ray Langston, I know.

00:17:29,105 --> 00:17:30,173
Albert Robbins.

00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,009
Always happy to meet
a fellow sawbones.

00:17:33,076 --> 00:17:35,145
You've already met
Don Kingsley.

00:17:37,013 --> 00:17:40,016
And that is shrapnel
from the explosion.

00:17:41,017 --> 00:17:42,919
And what's this
yellow residue?

00:17:42,986 --> 00:17:44,254
That's not my department.

00:17:44,321 --> 00:17:46,590
I sent a sample to Hodges.
He's in Trace.

00:17:46,656 --> 00:17:48,158
We've met.

00:17:48,225 --> 00:17:51,361
Glass shards are only
in his feet and lower legs.

00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:58,168
I was just about to
dissect his trachea.

00:17:58,235 --> 00:17:59,970
Care to do the honors?

00:18:00,036 --> 00:18:01,638
It's been a while since I cut.

00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:02,639
Eh, it's like

00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:04,841
destroying a bicycle--
come on.

00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:31,768
Oh... no soot.

00:18:31,835 --> 00:18:33,870
This man wasn't breathing
while the fire was burning.

00:18:33,937 --> 00:18:36,339
So, he croaked before he cooked.

00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:38,241
Well, that would
explain the calvarium.

00:18:38,308 --> 00:18:40,176
It's cracked along
the sutures.

00:18:40,243 --> 00:18:41,645
Is that from the fire?

00:18:41,711 --> 00:18:42,679
Well, it gets hot enough

00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,214
to boil a brain,
the, uh, steam

00:18:44,281 --> 00:18:45,682
has to get out somehow.

00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:48,752
(sizzling)

00:18:52,289 --> 00:18:54,057
That's not what
I was going to show you.

00:18:58,261 --> 00:18:59,963
Subdural hematoma.

00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:00,997
ROBBINS:
Mm-hmm.

00:19:01,064 --> 00:19:03,099
So, he was clocked

00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:05,068
before he croaked and cooked.

00:19:11,007 --> 00:19:13,009
Congratulations, Ray.
Your first arson

00:19:13,076 --> 00:19:16,079
has become your first homicide.

00:19:26,121 --> 00:19:28,223
Somebody could've
hit him with this.

00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:30,425
Yeah, that or just about
anything else in here

00:19:30,492 --> 00:19:33,295
that didn't get burned up
or washed away.

00:19:35,864 --> 00:19:37,733
Okay, we should bag everything

00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:40,602
that might have been used
as a weapon or a remote

00:19:40,669 --> 00:19:43,105
or a delayed ignition source.

00:19:43,172 --> 00:19:44,373
Since it's pretty obvious

00:19:44,439 --> 00:19:46,942
the arsonist wasn't in here
when this place went up.

00:19:47,009 --> 00:19:48,277
All right.

00:19:48,343 --> 00:19:50,412
Piece of cake.

00:20:05,594 --> 00:20:08,931
Excuse me, sir?

00:20:08,997 --> 00:20:11,700
You, uh, mind if I ask
what you're doing here?

00:20:11,767 --> 00:20:13,235
Documenting my losses.

00:20:13,302 --> 00:20:14,436
Your losses?

00:20:14,503 --> 00:20:16,338
I'm Josh Barston.
The Kingsleys' contractor.

00:20:16,405 --> 00:20:19,508
All that gear is mine.
Luckily, it's insured.

00:20:19,575 --> 00:20:20,709
Did you do all
the construction here?

00:20:20,776 --> 00:20:21,977
Yep.

00:20:22,044 --> 00:20:24,379
Everything's up to code.
I got all the permits.

00:20:24,446 --> 00:20:25,647
Well, that's good, 'cause
I'm going to need copies

00:20:25,714 --> 00:20:27,916
of all your plans and
construction photos.

00:20:27,983 --> 00:20:29,184
As well as
contact information

00:20:29,251 --> 00:20:31,119
for you and your crew,
if you don't mind.

00:20:31,186 --> 00:20:32,988
Sure, whatever you want.

00:20:52,841 --> 00:20:55,377
♪ ♪

00:21:17,766 --> 00:21:20,502
That's a lot
of concentration
for a property crime.

00:21:20,569 --> 00:21:21,870
I think it just paid off.

00:21:21,937 --> 00:21:23,672
This is
a pawn shop receipt

00:21:23,739 --> 00:21:26,341
for an antique cameo
and a diamond ring--

00:21:26,408 --> 00:21:29,344
the only two items left missing.

00:21:29,411 --> 00:21:31,413
Our suspect is, what,
14 years old?

00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,482
He didn't pawn these things
by himself.

00:21:33,549 --> 00:21:36,518
WILLOWS: You sure you don't
want to give this a shot?

00:21:36,585 --> 00:21:38,921
LANGSTON: I'd prefer
to watch you.

00:21:41,423 --> 00:21:44,193
Magnetic powder works best
on porous surfaces,

00:21:44,259 --> 00:21:45,627
because it doesn't smear.

00:21:45,694 --> 00:21:47,362
I hear it's all
in the wrist.

00:21:47,429 --> 00:21:51,567
WILLOWS: Actually, I think it's
in the fingers, but that's me.

00:22:00,442 --> 00:22:01,376
Nice!

00:22:01,443 --> 00:22:04,046
Mm! The scanner's
behind us.

00:22:23,131 --> 00:22:24,967
<i>Diane</i> Palento?

00:22:25,033 --> 00:22:26,335
The kid's mother.

00:22:27,636 --> 00:22:29,538
Priors for shoplifting and...

00:22:29,605 --> 00:22:32,307
ah, narcotics possession.

00:22:32,374 --> 00:22:34,276
ADAMS: That's your mother
pawning stolen property.

00:22:34,343 --> 00:22:35,677
You didn't get
that stuff

00:22:35,744 --> 00:22:37,079
from the
neighborhood kids.

00:22:37,145 --> 00:22:39,281
Your mother gave it to you,
didn't she, Alex?

00:22:39,348 --> 00:22:41,016
She didn't steal it.

00:22:41,083 --> 00:22:43,051
She bought it
from a garage sale.

00:22:43,118 --> 00:22:45,220
You've been seeing her?

00:22:45,287 --> 00:22:48,590
Taking presents from her
and lying to me about it?

00:22:48,657 --> 00:22:49,992
So what?

00:22:50,058 --> 00:22:51,960
You lied to me.

00:22:52,027 --> 00:22:53,962
Said that she moved
to New York.

00:22:54,029 --> 00:22:55,330
She didn't love me anymore.

00:22:55,397 --> 00:22:57,299
I did it to
protect...
It's not true!

00:22:57,366 --> 00:22:58,567
I did it to protect you, Alex.

00:22:58,634 --> 00:23:00,135
Your mother
has problems,

00:23:00,202 --> 00:23:01,837
(over speaker): and she's not
doing anything to help herself!

00:23:01,904 --> 00:23:04,106
Yes, she is.
Yes, she is!

00:23:04,173 --> 00:23:05,807
ALEX: She's getting her
act together, okay?

00:23:05,874 --> 00:23:07,376
Saving up for a
nice apartment

00:23:07,442 --> 00:23:09,244
so she and I can
live together.

00:23:09,311 --> 00:23:12,447
You are not going anywhere
except juvenile hall,

00:23:12,514 --> 00:23:16,018
because receiving stolen
property-- that's a crime.

00:23:16,084 --> 00:23:18,820
Stealing is a
bigger crime.

00:23:19,888 --> 00:23:22,457
I know you're not
a thief, Alex.

00:23:22,524 --> 00:23:23,692
You're a good kid.

00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:25,794
You made some
bad decisions.

00:23:25,861 --> 00:23:28,597
I know you two
love each other,

00:23:28,664 --> 00:23:30,866
but your mom made some
bad decisions, too,

00:23:30,933 --> 00:23:35,537
and I can't help her
unless you help me.

00:23:35,604 --> 00:23:37,906
That duffel bag
is hers, isn't it?

00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:42,044
When does she come around?

00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:44,780
She sleeps there
at night.

00:23:44,847 --> 00:23:46,949
She stays
on the floor.

00:23:47,015 --> 00:23:51,353
Look, it's just
for a while, okay?

00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:53,822
She's gonna get her own place.

00:23:53,889 --> 00:23:55,591
We're gonna live together.

00:24:01,063 --> 00:24:02,965
ADAMS:
It won't be much
of a stakeout.

00:24:03,031 --> 00:24:04,967
I doubt we'll have
to set up on her

00:24:05,033 --> 00:24:06,101
more than one night.

00:24:06,168 --> 00:24:07,236
She'll show up.

00:24:07,302 --> 00:24:08,871
Bad parents crave
unconditional love.

00:24:08,937 --> 00:24:09,972
Well, I know I do.

00:24:10,038 --> 00:24:12,441
I'll put a couple guys on it.

00:24:12,508 --> 00:24:14,443
I really think you broke
through to him.

00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:18,080
I was just trying to get him
to give up his mother.

00:24:19,114 --> 00:24:20,549
Thanks for
the uni's, Captain.

00:24:20,616 --> 00:24:22,384
Sure thing,
no problem.

00:24:25,354 --> 00:24:26,622
STOKES:
<i>Hey, Jim.</i>

00:24:26,688 --> 00:24:28,323
I got the crispy critter's
cell phone records.

00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:30,559
And get this--
the wife's assistant

00:24:30,626 --> 00:24:33,262
called 23 times in the 48 hours
prior to his death.

00:24:33,328 --> 00:24:34,997
BRASS:
Sounds like more
than a working relationship.

00:24:35,063 --> 00:24:36,331
Yeah, I'd say so.

00:24:36,398 --> 00:24:38,634
You're gonna love
the voice mails she left him.

00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:41,670
(dance music playing)

00:24:50,212 --> 00:24:51,847
Good.

00:25:06,428 --> 00:25:07,863
That's impressive, Carla.

00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:08,997
So, tell me,

00:25:09,064 --> 00:25:11,233
where were you
on the night of the fire?

00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,835
I was here working.

00:25:12,901 --> 00:25:15,704
You don't have
to take my word for it.

00:25:15,771 --> 00:25:17,239
There's surveillance
all over this place.

00:25:17,306 --> 00:25:19,775
No, I'm not going to take your
word for it-- check this out.

00:25:19,842 --> 00:25:22,444
CARLA:
Don, I'm standing
outside your house,

00:25:22,511 --> 00:25:24,279
and once again, you're not here.

00:25:24,346 --> 00:25:25,614
I warned you not to pull
another no-show,

00:25:25,681 --> 00:25:26,615
you gutless son of a bitch.

00:25:26,682 --> 00:25:28,417
I want to <i>see</i> you tonight.

00:25:31,353 --> 00:25:34,356
Okay, I was at Don's house last
night a little before 11:00,

00:25:34,423 --> 00:25:36,458
but I left
right after that.

00:25:37,526 --> 00:25:39,595
What were you doing
at my house last night?

00:25:39,661 --> 00:25:42,431
Trying to get the 20 Gs
your husband owed me.

00:25:42,498 --> 00:25:44,933
What are you talking about?
You know those

00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,935
herbal supplements he tried
to get you to sell here?

00:25:47,002 --> 00:25:48,604
Yeah, the ones
that give you diarrhea?

00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:50,138
I fronted him
the money for that.

00:25:50,205 --> 00:25:51,673
He said it might be
a good way for us

00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,408
to earn some money on the side,
and like an idiot,

00:25:53,475 --> 00:25:54,409
I believed him.

00:25:54,476 --> 00:25:55,744
Did you sleep with him?

00:25:55,811 --> 00:25:56,778
I don't sleep with losers.

00:25:56,845 --> 00:25:57,779
Don wasn't a loser.

00:25:57,846 --> 00:25:59,581
Come on, Paulla.

00:25:59,648 --> 00:26:01,583
He was a nice guy...

00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:02,718
Complete airhead.

00:26:02,784 --> 00:26:03,819
You outgrew him
years ago.

00:26:03,886 --> 00:26:05,153
You just couldn't admit it.

00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,221
BRASS:
Hey, hey.

00:26:06,288 --> 00:26:08,123
L-L-Ladies, ladies...
Bitch!

00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:10,893
What's wrong with you?
Let's go down to
the police station.

00:26:10,959 --> 00:26:13,729
We can make your statements
on record, okay?

00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:16,565
I'll give
you a ride.

00:26:23,739 --> 00:26:26,675
A power cord to nowhere.

00:26:27,676 --> 00:26:28,610
I don't
remember seeing

00:26:28,677 --> 00:26:30,812
any appliances
missing their cords.

00:26:42,891 --> 00:26:45,494
Greg, will you come
take a look at this, please?

00:26:50,432 --> 00:26:52,634
We found residue like
that on glass shards

00:26:52,701 --> 00:26:55,170
taken out of Don
Kingsley's body.

00:26:55,237 --> 00:26:58,173
SANDERS:
Looks like galvanized metal.

00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,443
Maybe a piece of roof flashing.

00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:04,513
Did you I.D. the residue
on the glass?

00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:06,982
Hodges is working on it, I hope.

00:27:08,851 --> 00:27:10,252
SANDERS:
Grid 13.

00:27:14,223 --> 00:27:16,358
Well, we found it

00:27:16,425 --> 00:27:19,695
about seven feet
from the origin.

00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:28,203
These marks look like the result
of an electrical arc.

00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:30,873
And in a room filled with gas,

00:27:30,939 --> 00:27:33,375
an arc is as good as a spark.

00:27:33,442 --> 00:27:34,910
Okay.

00:27:34,977 --> 00:27:38,881
But there's got to be more
to a timed detonator than this.

00:27:38,947 --> 00:27:40,382
I agree.

00:27:44,019 --> 00:27:46,188
Looks like we're
working a double.

00:27:48,821 --> 00:27:50,156
HODGES:
The residue on the metal disc

00:27:50,223 --> 00:27:51,991
is indeed what was found
on the glass shards.

00:27:52,058 --> 00:27:53,493
<i>Zea mays.</i>

00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,229
Well, my botany's
a little rusty, but I'd say...

00:27:56,296 --> 00:27:57,697
corn.

00:27:57,764 --> 00:27:59,566
I call it maize.

00:27:59,632 --> 00:28:01,634
Are you trying to impress me?

00:28:02,669 --> 00:28:04,337
Did I?

00:28:07,574 --> 00:28:10,410
So, we've got
corn, a Mason jar,

00:28:10,476 --> 00:28:12,512
a piece of metal
roof flashing

00:28:12,579 --> 00:28:13,846
and an electrical cord.

00:28:13,913 --> 00:28:15,815
How do you make a
detonator out of that?

00:28:16,849 --> 00:28:18,318
I don't know.

00:28:19,352 --> 00:28:21,421
You don't know.

00:28:22,726 --> 00:28:25,262
That's not your reputation,
Mr. Hodges.

00:28:31,035 --> 00:28:33,170
(murmuring)

00:28:36,607 --> 00:28:37,808
I'm telling you, every time

00:28:37,875 --> 00:28:39,443
I turn around,
one of these uni's

00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:41,112
is giving us
the stink eye.

00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:44,181
Come on now,
you're imagining that.
No, I'm not.

00:28:44,248 --> 00:28:46,417
That's what happens when you
make a lab geek undersheriff.

00:28:46,484 --> 00:28:48,786
Oh, that job is
punishment enough.

00:28:48,853 --> 00:28:50,421
I actually feel sorry
for Ecklie.

00:28:50,488 --> 00:28:52,456
(laughing)

00:28:52,523 --> 00:28:53,924
You like burned toast, Ray?

00:28:53,991 --> 00:28:55,226
Occasionally, but, uh...

00:28:55,292 --> 00:28:57,661
I've seen enough charcoal
for one day.

00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:59,063
Oh, man.

00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:00,231
WILLOWS:
What?

00:29:00,297 --> 00:29:01,699
Look at that.

00:29:05,402 --> 00:29:06,670
You see that?
Yeah, I do.

00:29:06,737 --> 00:29:08,239
(all groaning)

00:29:08,305 --> 00:29:10,007
See that?

00:29:10,074 --> 00:29:13,010
No wonder why Grissom
loves this place.

00:29:13,077 --> 00:29:14,411
(all groaning)

00:29:14,473 --> 00:29:16,776
WILLOWS:
You didn't just
do that, did you?

00:29:16,842 --> 00:29:18,210
What?

00:29:18,277 --> 00:29:19,378
(laughing):
Ew!

00:29:19,445 --> 00:29:20,412
Check, please.

00:29:20,479 --> 00:29:21,680
It's on me.

00:29:22,715 --> 00:29:24,984
The new guy pays, right?

00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:26,352
Only if he's smart.

00:29:26,419 --> 00:29:27,186
Thank you.

00:29:27,253 --> 00:29:28,141
SANDERS:
Thank you.

00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:29,209
It's my shift
on the Palento stakeout.

00:29:29,276 --> 00:29:31,711
You coming?
Yes.

00:29:31,778 --> 00:29:33,547
Oh, hey, Ray, I'll, uh,
I'll give you a lift.

00:29:33,613 --> 00:29:35,415
Okay, thanks.

00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:39,085
So, Nicky, Mr. Eater-of-Flies...

00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:40,487
Hmm.

00:29:40,554 --> 00:29:42,189
(sighs)

00:29:42,255 --> 00:29:43,790
...I want you to have
Grissom's office.

00:29:45,792 --> 00:29:47,828
I thought you were
gonna use it.

00:29:47,894 --> 00:29:49,362
I hate moving.

00:29:49,429 --> 00:29:50,564
I don't know about that.

00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:52,265
Doesn't really feel right.

00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:55,235
Well, it may not
for a while, but...

00:29:55,302 --> 00:29:57,304
Make it your own.

00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,275
(doorbells jingle)

00:30:14,988 --> 00:30:16,756
Maybe she won't show up.

00:30:18,792 --> 00:30:20,894
Kind of sounds like
you're hoping she won't.

00:30:20,961 --> 00:30:23,897
She's not helping her son.

00:30:23,964 --> 00:30:27,033
Maybe not.

00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:30,003
But...

00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:32,072
he's making choices here, too.

00:30:32,139 --> 00:30:34,141
Yes, he is.

00:30:38,778 --> 00:30:40,747
Mommy's home.

00:30:40,814 --> 00:30:42,816
We're moving now.

00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:50,624

Leave me alone!

00:30:51,691 --> 00:30:52,926
Get her!
Leave me alone!

Ray?

00:30:54,961 --> 00:30:57,063
No! No!

A corn meal bomb.

Apparently, it's an old

00:33:42,829 --> 00:33:44,831
All in one.

00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:47,534
Okay...

00:33:49,236 --> 00:33:51,238
I'm impressed.

00:34:00,686 --> 00:34:02,487
I had to cut the
metal disc by hand

00:34:02,554 --> 00:34:04,389
to get it to fit
in the Mason jar,

00:34:04,456 --> 00:34:06,091
which means the
suspect did, too.

00:34:06,158 --> 00:34:08,326
I think we should go
back through the evidence

00:34:08,393 --> 00:34:10,662
from the Kingsley garage
and do tool mark comparisons

00:34:10,729 --> 00:34:12,931
on anything that could have
been used to cut the disc.

00:34:12,998 --> 00:34:14,566
Well, that can take
a couple of weeks,

00:34:14,633 --> 00:34:15,567
assuming the tool's
even there.

00:34:15,634 --> 00:34:17,402
And even if it is there,
you still have

00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:18,804
to connect it directly
to a suspect.

00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:20,439
Well, one step
at a time, right?
Right.

00:34:20,505 --> 00:34:21,907
Let's see what Archie
has for us.

00:34:21,973 --> 00:34:23,909
Hey, man,
I got your text.

00:34:23,975 --> 00:34:25,077
What's going on?

00:34:25,143 --> 00:34:28,213
Hey. Check this out.

00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:32,117
This is earlier,
the day of the murder.

00:34:33,151 --> 00:34:35,253
STOKES: Where did
you get this?

00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,155
Brass pulled it
from Paulla Kingsley's gym.

00:34:42,928 --> 00:34:44,296
JOHNSON:
10:07.

00:34:44,363 --> 00:34:47,265
That's about two hours
before the fire.

00:34:47,332 --> 00:34:48,467
You know what that means...

00:34:48,533 --> 00:34:50,769
Yeah, it means he had motive,

00:34:50,836 --> 00:34:53,805
and time to set the detonator.

00:34:53,872 --> 00:34:56,508
It's always sad
when a husband gets in the way

00:34:56,575 --> 00:34:59,111
of his wife's
blossoming relationship

00:34:59,177 --> 00:35:02,481
with their contractor, hmm?

00:35:02,547 --> 00:35:04,816
It was strictly platonic.

00:35:04,883 --> 00:35:07,185
I was in crisis,

00:35:07,252 --> 00:35:10,122
and Josh was a good listener.

00:35:10,188 --> 00:35:12,290
Oh, I'm sure he was.

00:35:12,357 --> 00:35:14,359
I'm sure he listened
to you complain

00:35:14,426 --> 00:35:16,795
about your
financial situation,

00:35:16,862 --> 00:35:20,532
and what a loser
your airhead husband is.

00:35:22,601 --> 00:35:24,636
So, whose idea was it
to kill Don?

00:35:24,703 --> 00:35:26,905
Was it yours or Josh's?

00:35:26,972 --> 00:35:31,043
What are you saying, that
Josh killed my husband?

00:35:34,746 --> 00:35:37,683
Oh, my God.

00:35:37,749 --> 00:35:39,785
I'm going to be sick.

00:35:39,851 --> 00:35:42,487
We were in love.

00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:47,826
She was going to leave him,
so we could be together.

00:35:51,229 --> 00:35:53,999
She lost her nerve.

00:35:54,066 --> 00:35:57,736
PAULLA: I told Josh
that I couldn't leave Don.

00:35:59,771 --> 00:36:01,707
That I...

00:36:01,773 --> 00:36:03,709
That I still loved him

00:36:03,775 --> 00:36:05,777
despite his flaws.

00:36:07,212 --> 00:36:09,147
JOSH:
<i>That loser.</i>

00:36:09,214 --> 00:36:11,383
He was taking her down with him.

00:36:13,118 --> 00:36:15,754
I realized there was only
one way to save her.

00:36:17,522 --> 00:36:19,524
So I built the detonator.

00:36:21,257 --> 00:36:24,727
And after I took her to work,
I took care of the problem.

00:36:24,794 --> 00:36:27,230
Told Don there was a problem

00:36:27,296 --> 00:36:29,232
with the gas line
in the garage.

00:36:29,298 --> 00:36:31,467
(chuckles)

00:36:35,605 --> 00:36:37,740
Check out the pilot light.

00:36:45,648 --> 00:36:49,085
(gas hissing)

00:36:55,258 --> 00:36:57,260
He was holding her hostage.

00:36:59,629 --> 00:37:01,798
(inhales deeply)

00:37:01,864 --> 00:37:03,499
And I set her free.

00:37:03,566 --> 00:37:05,068
(exhales)

00:37:08,471 --> 00:37:11,007
Brass just closed

00:37:11,074 --> 00:37:12,275
your arson-murder.

00:37:12,342 --> 00:37:13,676
Contractor confessed.

00:37:13,743 --> 00:37:15,378
Nice work.

00:37:15,445 --> 00:37:17,347
Thanks.

00:37:17,413 --> 00:37:19,415
I thought
that this one was closed, too.

00:37:19,482 --> 00:37:21,551
It is.

00:37:21,617 --> 00:37:24,120
Then why are you wasting
the taxpayers' money?

00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:28,558
I'm kidding.
(wry laugh)

00:37:28,624 --> 00:37:31,060
Um...

00:37:31,127 --> 00:37:32,962
a rock...
Mm-hmm.

00:37:33,029 --> 00:37:34,597
...through a window.

00:37:34,664 --> 00:37:37,233
Don't you think Diane Palento
was a little too street smart

00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,901
to make that much noise
breaking in?

00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:42,480
The owner came home,

00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,798
said he...

00:37:44,023 --> 00:37:45,357
discovered he had been robbed.

00:37:45,424 --> 00:37:47,726
So why was his laptop
still in the house?

00:37:47,793 --> 00:37:49,828
Wouldn't that have been
at work with him?

00:37:49,895 --> 00:37:52,498
And look-- his watch.

00:37:52,565 --> 00:37:55,134
Most guys take their watches off
to shower, or to...

00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,369
to swim,
to, uh...
Have sex.

00:37:57,436 --> 00:37:59,972
Except his wife was out of town
that weekend.

00:38:01,607 --> 00:38:03,842
So, I checked his web history.

00:38:03,909 --> 00:38:05,277
Take a look at this.

00:38:05,344 --> 00:38:07,179
"Diamond."

00:38:07,246 --> 00:38:09,315
AKA Diane Palento.

00:38:09,381 --> 00:38:11,116
Very classy.

00:38:11,183 --> 00:38:13,385
The husband hires himself
a hooker,

00:38:13,452 --> 00:38:17,056
and after, when he passes out

00:38:17,122 --> 00:38:19,792
or takes a shower,
she rips him off.

00:38:19,858 --> 00:38:23,229
He might be able to explain away
the laptop and the watch,

00:38:23,295 --> 00:38:25,030
but not his wife's jewelry.

00:38:26,332 --> 00:38:28,500
I think he decided to stage a...

00:38:28,567 --> 00:38:30,603
fake break-in.

00:38:32,471 --> 00:38:34,740
(rubbing hands together)
Shall we go bust him now?

00:38:34,807 --> 00:38:35,975
The only thing that

00:38:36,041 --> 00:38:38,143
we could get him for
is filing a false report.

00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:41,547
It's a misdemeanor, and the
D.A. would never prosecute,

00:38:41,614 --> 00:38:44,016
so, you got to just
return the property

00:38:44,083 --> 00:38:45,818
and call it a day.

00:38:45,884 --> 00:38:47,386
A good day.

00:38:52,725 --> 00:38:55,427
My grandfather gave this
to my grandmother

00:38:55,494 --> 00:38:56,896
in McKeesport, Pennsylvania,

00:38:56,962 --> 00:38:58,530
in 1914.

00:38:58,597 --> 00:39:00,366
Never thought that
I'd see it again.

00:39:00,432 --> 00:39:01,800
I can't
thank you enough.

00:39:01,867 --> 00:39:03,369
Tell him how
you lost it.

00:39:03,435 --> 00:39:06,205
What, does that matter?

00:39:06,272 --> 00:39:07,773
Tell him.

00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,341
That's not really
necessary, ma'am.
Would you...?

00:39:09,408 --> 00:39:10,381
Can we please
just go?

00:39:10,381 --> 00:39:13,429
Don't you touch me,
you diseased pervert.

00:39:13,429 --> 00:39:15,465
Oh, come on, I made
a mistake, honey.

00:39:15,532 --> 00:39:17,834
A mistake? You brought
a whore into our bedroom,

00:39:17,901 --> 00:39:20,436
and you had disgusting sex
with her on my bed.

00:39:20,503 --> 00:39:23,039
No, I did not have
disgusting sex-- I told you--

00:39:23,106 --> 00:39:25,141
I got drunk and passed out,
because subconsciously,

00:39:25,208 --> 00:39:27,076
honey, I could not
go through with it.

00:39:27,143 --> 00:39:28,578
Well, subconsciously,
I can't stay married

00:39:28,645 --> 00:39:29,746
to a degenerate sleazeball.

00:39:29,813 --> 00:39:31,448
I've never done anything
like this before.

00:39:31,514 --> 00:39:32,615
I've never done
anything like...

00:39:32,682 --> 00:39:33,850
How can I even trust you?

00:39:33,917 --> 00:39:35,351
Come on! I didn't even
get to do anything.

00:39:35,418 --> 00:39:36,386
Oh, so now
you're disappointed

00:39:36,453 --> 00:39:37,620
you didn't get
to foul our sheets...

00:39:48,164 --> 00:39:50,099
Alex, listen,

00:39:50,166 --> 00:39:52,902
I know you feel as if
you betrayed your mother,

00:39:52,969 --> 00:39:54,838
but believe me,

00:39:54,904 --> 00:39:57,674
it may be the best thing
that ever happened to her.

00:39:59,709 --> 00:40:02,112
Your mother's going
to need your help.

00:40:02,178 --> 00:40:04,114
You may be the
only person

00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,782
that she'll listen to.

00:40:05,849 --> 00:40:07,717
I know it's
not a fair thing

00:40:07,784 --> 00:40:09,352
to ask of a
14-year-old kid,

00:40:09,419 --> 00:40:12,422
but you've got to
be strong for her.

00:40:14,624 --> 00:40:17,160
Try to get her to go
to a rehab program.

00:40:17,227 --> 00:40:20,363
I can get you a list
of places, if you like.

00:40:45,155 --> 00:40:47,724
You sure you're
okay with this?

00:40:47,791 --> 00:40:49,325
You can still
change your mind.

00:40:49,392 --> 00:40:51,227
ADAMS:
No, you can't.

00:40:51,294 --> 00:40:53,930
I said I'd kill for an office,
and I meant it.

00:40:53,997 --> 00:40:56,232
Even a shared one.

00:40:56,299 --> 00:40:59,369
Wow. This is a very
classy move, Nick.

00:40:59,435 --> 00:41:01,738
Very classy.

00:41:01,805 --> 00:41:03,239
Seriously.

00:41:03,306 --> 00:41:05,241
Well, you're welcome.

00:41:05,308 --> 00:41:07,243
There's good energy in here.

00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:09,145
It'll be nice to share it.

00:41:14,851 --> 00:41:17,387
This belongs here.

00:41:47,484 --> 00:41:50,553
♪ ♪

00:42:09,629 --> 00:42:11,564
We're off the clock.

00:42:11,631 --> 00:42:13,934
I know.

00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:19,004
I'll see you tomorrow.
