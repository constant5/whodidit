LANGSTON:
<i>I responded to a recovered</i>

00:00:07,441 --> 00:00:10,978
<i>missing person's vehicle</i>
<i>at the Orpheus Casino.</i>

00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:15,015
<i>When I opened the trunk,</i>
<i>I observed a rolled-up carpet</i>

00:00:15,082 --> 00:00:20,821

<i>which appeared to be blood.</i>

00:00:20,888 --> 00:00:25,325
<i>Inside the carpet, I discovered</i>
<i>the body of Amber Jones.</i>

00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:29,596
I also observed
three gunshot wounds.

00:00:29,663 --> 00:00:34,635
One to the right shoulder.

00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:37,738
Two to the abdomen.

00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,510
The Medical Examiner

00:00:43,577 --> 00:00:46,446
was able to recover
all three of the bullets.

00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:49,950

<i>millimeter caliber,</i>

<i>Consistent with the</i>

<i>Walther and Beretta.</i>

LANGSTON:
<i>No, the weapon</i>

00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:28,922
Can you tell us
if the defendant owns a gun?

00:01:28,989 --> 00:01:30,324
Yes.

Congressman Griffin has one
firearm registered in his name.

Why not?

00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:51,512
The congressman stated that
his gun had been stolen.

00:01:52,646 --> 00:01:54,314
So, he must've
filed a police report?

00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:58,018
The congressman claimed that he
didn't know his gun was missing

00:01:58,085 --> 00:02:00,921
until CSI asked him
to produce it.

00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:06,493
Hey!

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,797

00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:41,028
Catherine!

00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,706
There was just one shot.

00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:55,375
It came from right
outside the door.

00:03:00,414 --> 00:03:01,682
What happened here?

00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:03,350
He had a gun.

00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:04,651
He was headed
for the courtroom.

00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:08,222
I tried to get him to stop,
but he just looked at me

00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:10,123
and blew his brains out.

00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,025
I did not fire
my weapon.

00:03:12,092 --> 00:03:13,894
That's Dominic Humphreys,

00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:15,395
the congressman's
Chief of Staff.

00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:18,432
The prosecution's key witness.

Dominic Humphreys' suicide?

00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:11,919
Why do you think he did it?

00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:14,087
Dominic Humphreys was my friend.

00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:15,956
His death is not only
a great loss to me,

00:04:16,023 --> 00:04:17,291
but to the people of the state.

00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:19,293
Then why was he a witness
for the prosecution?

00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:20,861
That's all I want to say.
That's enough,

00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:30,437
The only reason a guy
eats his gun in a courthouse


00:04:30,504 --> 00:04:32,673
is to make a statement.


00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:35,375
Bullet looks like a
through-and-through.


00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:38,312
A lot of times,
you'll find the bullet


00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:40,914
in clotted blood
and brain matter.


00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:43,083
So, that's where
you want to start.


00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:51,725
Nine millimeter hollow point.


00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,493
That'll get the job done.


00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,862
Nick,


00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:57,564

She was on the kitchen floor.


00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:42,709
Dead.


00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:46,980
I saw that she was shot.


00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:49,349
There was a lot of blood.


00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:52,953
So much blood;

BRASS: Just tell me
what happened next.


00:05:57,991 --> 00:06:01,428
I asked him what happened


00:06:01,495 --> 00:06:03,463
and he swore he didn't kill her.


00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,332
That he found her like that,


00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:07,835
he had just
come over to apologize,


00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:11,271

00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:14,341

I told him to leave.

That I would take care of it.


00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:29,323
This was given
in exchange

Mr. Whitten can't

Eight minutes?
Eight hours?


00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:54,681
Depends on how well
the bullets are marked.

00:12:02,756 --> 00:12:04,691
He confessed.

00:12:04,758 --> 00:12:07,027
My experience as a doctor
tells me, Catherine,
that people tend

00:12:07,094 --> 00:12:09,863
to tell the truth when they know
they're going to die.

00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,899
Humphreys lied under oath.

00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:15,068
And his confession
is just words.

00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:16,937
And the gun is
equivocal.

00:12:17,004 --> 00:12:18,105
I mean,

00:12:18,172 --> 00:12:21,108
we know that he cleaned up
the crime scene.

00:12:21,175 --> 00:12:24,912
Maybe the gun was there, too,
and he lied about that.

00:12:24,978 --> 00:12:26,747
Or maybe he stole it from
the congressman's apartment,

00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:27,915
killed Amber with it,

00:12:27,981 --> 00:12:29,583
and the congressman is
telling the truth.

00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:31,585
Well...

00:12:31,652 --> 00:12:34,388
the ADA is moving
forward with the case.

00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:35,455
They haven't declared
a mistrial?

00:12:35,522 --> 00:12:36,590
The judge is going

00:12:36,657 --> 00:12:38,926
to allow the jury to hear
about the gun

00:12:38,992 --> 00:12:42,296
as well as Humphreys'
suicide confession.

00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:44,464
Which means I'll be back
on the stand.

00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:46,834
Ray, you testified
that congressman Griffin

00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,402
was the most
likely suspect.

00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:51,338
Which was true
based on the evidence

00:12:51,405 --> 00:12:52,506
that we had
at the time.

00:12:52,573 --> 00:12:53,974
And now, we have new evidence.

00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:56,143
And when the evidence changes,
we modify our theory

00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:58,512
to make it fit.

00:13:01,715 --> 00:13:04,718
All right.

00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:06,753
What's our theory now?

00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,689
I don't know yet.

00:13:15,062 --> 00:13:17,531
LAWYER:
<i>Dr. Langston,</i>
<i>I want to revisit</i>

00:13:17,598 --> 00:13:19,099
the autopsy results.

00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:21,935
The defendant claims he never
had intercourse with Miss Jones.

00:13:22,002 --> 00:13:25,038
Did you find any evidence
to the contrary?

00:13:25,105 --> 00:13:26,206
Objection! Leading.

00:13:26,273 --> 00:13:27,341
Sustained.

00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:28,976
But the witness may answer
the question.

00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:30,544
Yes.

00:13:30,611 --> 00:13:33,981
We discovered that the victim
had occluded fallopian tubes.

00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:35,649
<i>Our tests confirmed</i>

00:13:35,716 --> 00:13:38,819
<i>that Miss Jones had</i>
<i>advanced chlamydia.</i>

00:13:38,886 --> 00:13:40,320
Because chlamydia is

00:13:40,387 --> 00:13:42,189
highly contagious,
it provided us

00:13:42,256 --> 00:13:43,857
with a method to confirm

00:13:43,924 --> 00:13:45,859
whether or not there had
been sexual contact.

00:13:45,926 --> 00:13:47,227
The congressman

00:13:47,294 --> 00:13:49,730
tested positive for the same
strain of chlamydia

00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:50,964
as the victim.

00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:52,866
Which means he
lied again.
Objection.

00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:55,536
Withdrawn.

00:13:55,602 --> 00:13:59,173
WILLOWS:
<i>There were dark fibers</i>
<i>found in the gun slide.</i>

00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:00,641
No match to what
Humphreys was wearing

00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:01,909
when he killed himself.

00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:04,845
So they could be from
Amber Jones' shooter?

00:14:04,912 --> 00:14:05,879
Yep.

00:14:05,946 --> 00:14:07,047
That'll be a good thing to know

00:14:07,114 --> 00:14:08,382
before the trial's over.

00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:10,384
We searched the congressman's
apartment before,

00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,386
but we weren't looking
for fibers.

00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:15,222
The judge has limited this
warrant to just his clothing.

00:14:15,289 --> 00:14:17,224
One of his attorneys
will be there for you.

00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:18,425
Great.

00:14:18,492 --> 00:14:20,594
So, I get a baby shark
as a chaperone.

00:14:20,661 --> 00:14:22,262
That'll be fun.
Let me guess,

00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:23,931
I get the suicide
closet.

00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:25,299
No lawyer.

00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:26,333
Just the widow.

00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,269
I'd rather have
the lawyer.

00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:30,771
Nick.

00:14:30,838 --> 00:14:32,339
This is going
to take a while.

00:14:32,406 --> 00:14:33,574
Well, we don't
have a while.

00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,742
Langston is back
on the stand.

00:14:35,809 --> 00:14:38,345
So, you got some fresh eyes
on this one.

00:14:38,412 --> 00:14:42,015
Could Dominic Humphreys
have killed Amber Jones?

00:14:42,082 --> 00:14:43,483
Let's start with opportunity.

00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,918
Did he have time to kill her?

00:14:44,985 --> 00:14:46,587
We've only got
approximate TOD.

00:14:46,653 --> 00:14:48,622
We found her body on a Saturday.

00:14:48,689 --> 00:14:51,091
And she died
sometime Wednesday.

00:14:51,158 --> 00:14:52,426
BRASS:
Okay, here's
what I got.

00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:54,795
Amber's last phone call
was at 10:07.

00:14:54,862 --> 00:14:56,530
She called in sick
to The Tassel Room.

00:14:56,597 --> 00:14:58,732
She's a dancer.

00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:00,234
Now, phone records also confirm

00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:03,103
that the congressman called
Humphreys at 5:03 PM.

00:15:04,104 --> 00:15:05,772
And the call lasted
three minutes.

00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,808
WILLOWS:
And according
to both men,

00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:09,309
the congressman made the call

00:15:09,376 --> 00:15:10,944
after he discovered
Amber's body.

00:15:14,147 --> 00:15:17,117
(stammering):
I need your help.

00:15:17,184 --> 00:15:19,119
No, Amber's dead!

00:15:19,186 --> 00:15:21,188
Oh, my God.

00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,658
I'm at her house.

00:15:24,725 --> 00:15:26,460
What do I do?

00:15:26,527 --> 00:15:29,129
That puts TOLD.
sometime between

00:15:29,196 --> 00:15:31,665
10:07 AM and 5:03 PM.

00:15:31,732 --> 00:15:34,134
Humphreys was

00:15:34,201 --> 00:15:36,503
at a high school with the
congressman from 9:30 AM...

00:15:37,571 --> 00:15:39,139
...until noon.

00:15:39,206 --> 00:15:41,942
Okay, and then,

00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:44,378
he chaired a hearing
from 2:30 till 5:00.

00:15:48,148 --> 00:15:49,850
He has no alibi
from noon

00:15:49,917 --> 00:15:52,486
to 2:30.

00:15:52,553 --> 00:15:53,520
He claimed he went to lunch.

00:15:53,587 --> 00:15:54,655
Alone.

00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:57,991
Well, then he had plenty of time
to kill her.

00:16:09,002 --> 00:16:11,205
So,

00:16:11,271 --> 00:16:13,574
how much do they pay you
to stand in a closet?

00:16:17,744 --> 00:16:19,680
I get it,

00:16:19,746 --> 00:16:21,849
they don't pay you to talk.

00:16:24,551 --> 00:16:27,554
MRS. GRIFFIN:
What the hell is
going on here?

00:16:29,323 --> 00:16:31,291
This is harassment.
Ma'am,

00:16:31,358 --> 00:16:33,627
I gave the search warrant
to your attorney.

00:16:33,694 --> 00:16:35,229
I'm here looking
for evidence.

00:16:35,295 --> 00:16:36,663
You don't have
enough evidence?

00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:38,532
Well, you're not going
to find anything here

00:16:38,599 --> 00:16:39,967
because my husband
isn't guilty.

00:16:40,033 --> 00:16:42,135
Ma'am, if you don't
let me do my job,

00:16:42,202 --> 00:16:44,972
I'm going to have to get
a uniform to remove you.

00:16:45,038 --> 00:16:47,975
From my own apartment?

00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:49,977
You people never stop.

00:16:50,043 --> 00:16:51,778
You've already
destroyed our lives.

00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:53,514
Haven't I lost enough?

00:17:07,794 --> 00:17:10,731
I'm all done here,
Mrs. Humphreys.

00:17:10,797 --> 00:17:13,567
Thank you for your cooperation.

00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:17,471
Do you think Dom killed her?

00:17:19,506 --> 00:17:21,508
Please.

00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:25,846
My husband's
already dead.

00:17:25,913 --> 00:17:28,182
I need to know.

00:17:28,248 --> 00:17:31,552
Look, I'm sorry, I can't talk
to you about the case.

00:17:31,618 --> 00:17:34,555
No one will talk to me.

00:17:34,621 --> 00:17:36,590
Not the police,

00:17:36,657 --> 00:17:38,592
not my friends.

00:17:38,659 --> 00:17:40,661
They don't know
what to say,
what to think.

00:17:45,632 --> 00:17:47,568
My advice,

00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:50,304
get out of this house.

00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,372
Go stay
with your family.

00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:57,711
Dom was my family.

00:17:57,778 --> 00:18:00,380
On the news,

00:18:00,447 --> 00:18:02,449
they said there was a note.

00:18:03,817 --> 00:18:06,820
What did it say?

00:18:07,855 --> 00:18:10,591
He said he loved you.

00:18:12,626 --> 00:18:14,595
Did he say why?

00:18:14,661 --> 00:18:17,164
Mrs. Humphreys...

00:18:17,231 --> 00:18:19,466
Please.

00:18:23,237 --> 00:18:25,639
You don't understand.

00:18:29,176 --> 00:18:32,179
Actually, I do.

00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:39,486
Your husband's note...

00:18:39,553 --> 00:18:42,489
whatever it says, it's...

00:18:42,556 --> 00:18:44,925
it's not going to take away
your doubts

00:18:44,992 --> 00:18:46,994
or your questions.

00:18:50,497 --> 00:18:53,500
Some people just can't be saved.

00:18:54,935 --> 00:18:57,638
Dr. Langston, you testified
that you discovered

00:18:57,704 --> 00:18:59,640
Miss Jones was killed
in her kitchen.

00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:01,642
Now, how did you figure
that out again?

00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,644
I searched for latent

00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,946
and cleaned up blood stains
using luminol.

00:19:06,013 --> 00:19:10,551
<i>The luminol revealed</i>
<i>a torso-shaped blood pool</i>

00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:12,819
<i>that was on the floor and had</i>
<i>recently been cleaned up.</i>

00:19:12,886 --> 00:19:13,987
<i>It also revealed</i>

00:19:14,054 --> 00:19:15,656
high velocity blood spatter
on the walls

00:19:15,722 --> 00:19:17,057
that was consistent
with a gunshot...

00:19:17,124 --> 00:19:18,659
Thank you, but
I'm not interested

00:19:18,725 --> 00:19:20,527
in that right now.
Let's move on, shall we?

00:19:20,594 --> 00:19:22,829
Now, you testified
you found

00:19:22,896 --> 00:19:24,498
one fingerprint from my client.

00:19:24,565 --> 00:19:25,532
Where did you find that?

00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:27,067
I found the congressman's print

00:19:27,134 --> 00:19:30,437
<i>on the tilt rod of the blinds</i>
<i>covering the front window.</i>

00:19:30,504 --> 00:19:32,439
Now, wasn't that
in the living room?

00:19:32,506 --> 00:19:34,341
But the murder happened
in the kitchen,

00:19:34,408 --> 00:19:35,509
so aren't the two unrelated?

00:19:35,576 --> 00:19:37,911
Which question would you like me
to answer?

00:19:39,947 --> 00:19:42,282
Can you tell the jury
what chemical you used

00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:44,618
to determine when my client
touched the tilt rod?

00:19:46,653 --> 00:19:48,522
There isn't one.
There isn't one.

00:19:48,589 --> 00:19:50,691
So are you
saying that

00:19:50,757 --> 00:19:53,193
that one print proves my client
pulled the trigger?

00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,195
No, but it does prove he lied.

00:19:55,262 --> 00:19:56,864
Until I found that print,

00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:58,732
the congressman denied
he was ever

00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,534
in the house.

00:20:00,601 --> 00:20:02,603
STOKES:
<i>Okay, Humphreys admitted</i>
<i>cleaning up the scene,</i>

00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:04,471
<i>but why a casino parking lot?</i>

00:20:04,538 --> 00:20:06,507
<i>Why would Humphreys dump</i>
<i>Amber's body there?</i>

00:20:06,573 --> 00:20:07,875
<i>He had to know</i>
<i>about surveillance.</i>

00:20:07,941 --> 00:20:09,610
I mean, that's how
you caught him, right?

00:20:09,676 --> 00:20:11,278
He was setting
up a fall guy.

00:20:11,345 --> 00:20:12,913
Figured it was
worth the risk.

00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,115
Humphreys was trying
to frame Amber's stalker

00:20:15,182 --> 00:20:16,950
ex-boyfriend.
Tommy Ruby.

00:20:17,017 --> 00:20:18,452
He's a limo driver
at the casino.

00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:19,686
Now, he was our
prime suspect.

00:20:19,753 --> 00:20:20,854
But we couldn't
talk to him.

00:20:20,921 --> 00:20:22,089
He blew town right
after the murder.

00:20:22,155 --> 00:20:23,524
How did Humphreys know
about him?

00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:26,560
Because Humphreys helped Amber
file a TRO

00:20:26,627 --> 00:20:28,595
against Tommy a few weeks
before she died.

00:20:28,662 --> 00:20:30,597
All right, I get the picture.

00:20:30,664 --> 00:20:33,066
Humphreys was the congressman's
little bitch.

00:20:33,133 --> 00:20:35,469
One of Humphreys' jobs is party
planning for the congressman.

00:20:35,536 --> 00:20:39,206
<i>The night before Amber died,</i>
<i>Humphreys called her up.</i>

00:20:39,273 --> 00:20:40,474
Amber, he wants to see you.

00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:42,109
Get over here
as soon as you can.

00:20:42,176 --> 00:20:44,845
Get this-- the congressman keeps
two apartments in his building.

00:20:44,912 --> 00:20:46,280
One is for him and the Missus,

00:20:46,346 --> 00:20:49,783
<i>the other</i>
<i>is for "entertaining".</i>

00:20:51,818 --> 00:20:55,322
<i>So we know they had a date</i>
<i>that night,</i>

00:20:55,389 --> 00:20:58,392
<i>but it wasn't all fun</i>
<i>and games.</i>

00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,594
I mean he even admits
they had an argument.

00:21:00,661 --> 00:21:03,363
<i>Now he claims he got so drunk</i>
<i>he passed out.</i>

00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:06,233
<i>But he saw her trying</i>
<i>to steal his wallet,</i>

00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:09,002
<i>so he hit her so hard</i>
<i>he split her eye open.</i>

00:21:09,069 --> 00:21:11,171
Which he only owned up to
because Langston

00:21:11,238 --> 00:21:13,440
found Amber's blood
in the apartment.

00:21:13,507 --> 00:21:15,108
Now, Humphreys drove her
to the emergency room,

00:21:15,175 --> 00:21:16,777
and he signed her out.

00:21:16,844 --> 00:21:19,446
STOKES:
He did everything the
congressman asked him to do,

00:21:19,513 --> 00:21:21,882
so if the congressman ordered
Humphreys to kill Amber,

00:21:21,949 --> 00:21:24,384
then why did he show up
at her house that afternoon?

00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:25,986
WILLOWS:
He wouldn't.

00:21:26,053 --> 00:21:27,421
So, killing Amber

00:21:27,487 --> 00:21:29,389
is all Humphreys' idea?

00:21:29,456 --> 00:21:31,692
Is that what we're concluding?

00:21:31,758 --> 00:21:33,627
Are you familiar
with a suicide note

00:21:33,694 --> 00:21:35,796
left by Dominic Humphreys?

00:21:37,231 --> 00:21:38,765
Yes.

00:21:38,832 --> 00:21:40,467
But I can't testify to it,
because I...

00:21:40,534 --> 00:21:42,135
I didn't process the scene.
No, that's right.

00:21:42,202 --> 00:21:43,537
You're still a rookie,
aren't you?

00:21:43,604 --> 00:21:44,638
That has nothing to do with it.

00:21:44,705 --> 00:21:46,273
I'm handing you a copy
of the note,

00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,908
which is marked
as defense exhibit M.

00:21:49,843 --> 00:21:52,546
Allow me to summarize
the contents.

00:21:52,613 --> 00:21:54,948
Mr. Humphreys confessed
to the murder

00:21:55,015 --> 00:21:57,150
of Amber Jones.

00:21:57,217 --> 00:21:59,987
Now, didn't you testify
that my client

00:22:00,053 --> 00:22:02,389
was the most likely suspect
in her murder?

00:22:02,456 --> 00:22:03,524
Yes, I did-- however...

00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:05,392
You still stand
by your own conclusion?

00:22:05,459 --> 00:22:07,794
In light of the new evidence...

00:22:07,861 --> 00:22:08,996
Yes or no?

00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,142
No... I can't.

00:22:22,209 --> 00:22:23,510
(gallery murmuring)

00:22:23,577 --> 00:22:24,878
JUDGE:
All right,
settle down, quiet.

00:22:38,618 --> 00:22:40,320
Thank you.

00:22:47,927 --> 00:22:50,063
Hello, Matty.

00:22:51,097 --> 00:22:53,066
My name is Ray,
Ray Langston.

00:22:54,667 --> 00:22:55,902
I know.

00:22:55,969 --> 00:22:57,403
Seen you on the stand.

00:22:59,772 --> 00:23:02,475
You're a very brave
girl, you know.

00:23:02,542 --> 00:23:05,879
I think your mother
would be very proud of you.

00:23:07,914 --> 00:23:10,850
I'm not even sure who
my mom really was.

00:23:12,886 --> 00:23:16,289
She always used
to say she was...

00:23:16,356 --> 00:23:18,958
a real dancer, an artist.

00:23:21,794 --> 00:23:22,929
First, she dies,

00:23:22,996 --> 00:23:26,166
and then I find out
she's full of crap.

00:23:26,232 --> 00:23:28,234
She was just
a stripper.

00:23:29,936 --> 00:23:32,939
Well, whatever the truth is
about your mother's life,

00:23:33,006 --> 00:23:35,308
she didn't deserve to die.

00:23:42,549 --> 00:23:43,883
You must be hungry.

00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:45,251
Would you, uh,
care for this?

00:23:45,318 --> 00:23:47,187
Oh, no.
Really, I can get
another one.

00:23:47,253 --> 00:23:48,788
I probably shouldn't
be eating this anyway.

00:23:48,855 --> 00:23:50,857
My stomach's
upset.

00:23:54,828 --> 00:23:57,831
How long have you
had that rash on your arm?

00:23:59,032 --> 00:24:01,668
I don't know,
a couple days.

00:24:01,734 --> 00:24:03,770
May I see
if you have a fever?

00:24:03,837 --> 00:24:05,805
Just need
to touch your neck.

00:24:05,872 --> 00:24:07,507
I'm a doctor--
it's okay.

00:24:10,143 --> 00:24:11,978
Matty, I'm going
to ask you a question,

00:24:12,045 --> 00:24:14,447
and I apologize
if it seems a bit awkward.

00:24:14,514 --> 00:24:15,715
Um, have you noticed

00:24:15,782 --> 00:24:18,718
that you haven't
been urinating a lot lately?

00:24:18,785 --> 00:24:19,886
I'm not like my mother.

00:24:19,953 --> 00:24:21,788
I don't have any diseases.
I know, I know,

00:24:21,855 --> 00:24:25,592
but I think you may
be very sick.

00:24:25,658 --> 00:24:29,062
We should get you to a hospital
as soon as possible.

00:24:29,128 --> 00:24:32,232
Tommy, Tommy, Tommy,
Tommy, my man!

00:24:32,298 --> 00:24:34,334
Bad idea to get in a bar fight

00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,169
when every cop in the county
is looking for you.

00:24:36,236 --> 00:24:37,270
(stammering):
I've been out of town.

00:24:37,337 --> 00:24:38,805
All right, I just
got back yesterday.

00:24:38,872 --> 00:24:40,306
Look, I just stopped by the club

00:24:40,373 --> 00:24:42,408
to say hey to my girls.
The Tassel Room.

00:24:42,475 --> 00:24:44,143
Amber Jones was one
of your girls-- remember her?

00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:45,979
You left town
the day she was murdered.

00:24:46,045 --> 00:24:47,380
Kind of makes you
look guilty.

00:24:47,447 --> 00:24:49,549
Yeah, but they caught the guy
that shot her.

00:24:49,616 --> 00:24:51,117
That, uh... the congressman.

00:24:51,184 --> 00:24:52,285
Look, I didn't
do nothing.

00:24:52,352 --> 00:24:53,419
You were stalking her.

00:24:53,486 --> 00:24:54,821
That's her side of the story.

00:24:54,888 --> 00:24:56,356
According to Amber's daughter,
you were parked

00:24:56,422 --> 00:24:58,591
outside her house the day
before her mother was murdered.

00:24:58,658 --> 00:25:00,193
<i>Amber filed a temporary</i>
<i>restraining order against you.</i>

00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:02,061
<i>She was afraid for her life.</i>

00:25:02,128 --> 00:25:03,129
Leave my mom alone!

00:25:03,196 --> 00:25:04,797
You're not supposed
to be here!

00:25:04,864 --> 00:25:06,166
Hey!

00:25:06,232 --> 00:25:09,068
I'm calling the cops
and getting your ass arrested!

00:25:10,503 --> 00:25:11,738
Matty's got it all wrong.

00:25:11,804 --> 00:25:14,073
All right, I was just trying
to make amends.

00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,975
See, I'm in the
12-step program.

00:25:16,042 --> 00:25:18,912
Making amends is part
of my recovery.

00:25:18,978 --> 00:25:20,613
Okay, I'm on step nine.

00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,882
Oh, I think you missed a couple
of steps there, Tommy,

00:25:22,949 --> 00:25:24,751
'cause you're drunk.

00:25:24,817 --> 00:25:26,085
You smell like a brewery.

00:25:26,152 --> 00:25:27,620
Can't walk in a straight line.

00:25:27,687 --> 00:25:30,924
I took Amber's death
really hard.

00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:33,827
All right, it set me back.

00:25:33,893 --> 00:25:35,795
See, I never got a chance
to tell her

00:25:35,862 --> 00:25:38,231
that I truly forgave her
for ruining my life.

00:25:41,367 --> 00:25:42,869
Look...

00:25:42,936 --> 00:25:45,605
you're either a stalker...

00:25:45,672 --> 00:25:47,473
or you're the best
eyewitness ever.

00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:48,875
What's it going to be?

00:25:49,909 --> 00:25:53,313
Oh, that's easy.

00:25:53,379 --> 00:25:54,914
What do you want to know?

00:25:54,981 --> 00:25:57,083
When was the last time
you saw her?

00:25:57,150 --> 00:26:00,353
The day after her kid
kicked the crap out of my limo.

00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:03,489
<i>I was in between pickups,</i>

00:26:03,556 --> 00:26:05,425
<i>and she received a package</i>

00:26:05,491 --> 00:26:07,527
<i>from Worldwide... World...</i>

00:26:07,594 --> 00:26:09,162
<i>World-Send.</i>

00:26:09,229 --> 00:26:10,763
<i>That's when I saw her.</i>

00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:13,500
<i>She looked like hell.</i>

00:26:13,566 --> 00:26:16,236
<i>She was always such a tease.</i>

00:26:16,302 --> 00:26:18,404
<i>Got a kick out</i>
<i>of making guys want her.</i>

00:26:18,471 --> 00:26:19,939
<i>It was 4:01 P.M.</i>

00:26:20,006 --> 00:26:21,875
<i>I remember,</i>

00:26:21,941 --> 00:26:24,377
because I got a call
from my dispatcher.

00:26:24,444 --> 00:26:26,579
Uh, I had to bounce
'cause I was running late.

00:26:26,646 --> 00:26:29,182
That's the last
time I saw her.

00:26:29,249 --> 00:26:30,617
Hey, wait a minute--
what about me?

00:26:30,683 --> 00:26:31,885
Can I go?
No.

00:26:31,951 --> 00:26:33,653
You're not going anywhere.

00:26:37,156 --> 00:26:38,391
What do you think?

00:26:38,458 --> 00:26:40,894
Well, we never found
a World-Send package,

00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,397
but we didn't process the house
until four days after the fact.

00:26:44,464 --> 00:26:45,465
If we can confirm

00:26:45,532 --> 00:26:47,767
that she got a delivery
just after 4:00,

00:26:47,834 --> 00:26:49,469
that narrows the TOD

00:26:49,536 --> 00:26:51,738
to between
4:00 and 5:00.

00:26:51,804 --> 00:26:53,773
That means that Dominic
Humphreys didn't kill her.

00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,576
Brings us back
to the congressman.

00:26:58,144 --> 00:27:00,213
PROSECUTION LAWYER:
<i>Amber Jones was a single mom,</i>

00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,582
<i>struggling to support</i>
<i>her teenage daughter.</i>

00:27:03,883 --> 00:27:06,886
Congressman Edward Griffin...

00:27:06,953 --> 00:27:08,321
is a married man.

00:27:08,388 --> 00:27:09,822
He seduced her.

00:27:09,889 --> 00:27:12,725
Took advantage
of her.

00:27:12,792 --> 00:27:14,861
He admits being
physically violent.

00:27:14,928 --> 00:27:16,996
And when Amber
became a liability

00:27:17,063 --> 00:27:19,232
to his marriage and his career,

00:27:19,299 --> 00:27:20,834
he murdered her.

00:27:25,572 --> 00:27:26,940
The defense would
have you believe

00:27:27,006 --> 00:27:29,108
that Dominic Humphreys
committed this crime.

00:27:29,175 --> 00:27:31,878
After all, Mr. Humphreys
confessed to it

00:27:31,945 --> 00:27:33,913
before taking his own life.

00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:38,651
But that's another lie
in a giant web of lies.

00:27:38,718 --> 00:27:40,019
The evidence proves beyond

00:27:40,086 --> 00:27:42,555
a reasonable doubt
Mr. Humphreys had an alibi

00:27:42,622 --> 00:27:45,358
and could not
have killed Amber Jones.

00:27:45,425 --> 00:27:49,195
The defendant needs to be held
accountable for his actions.

00:27:50,797 --> 00:27:52,765
Find him guilty.

00:27:55,568 --> 00:27:58,705
DEFENSE LAWYER:
<i>Amber Jones lost her life,</i>
<i>and that's a tragedy.</i>

00:28:00,039 --> 00:28:02,308
But she's not
the only victim here.

00:28:03,676 --> 00:28:06,145
My client lost
his life, too.

00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,848
Now, this man
is not perfect.

00:28:08,915 --> 00:28:10,283
He had an affair.

00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:12,485
He and his wife have dealt
with that privately,

00:28:12,552 --> 00:28:14,621
and she's forgiven him.

00:28:14,687 --> 00:28:18,024
But I'm going to tell you
what really happened.

00:28:18,091 --> 00:28:21,661
My client went
to Amber Jones' house

00:28:21,728 --> 00:28:23,863
to apologize
for losing his temper

00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:26,366
and to end the affair.

00:28:27,767 --> 00:28:31,104
He found her body.

00:28:31,171 --> 00:28:35,041
And that's when he made
a mistake he will regret

00:28:35,108 --> 00:28:37,310
for the rest
of his life.

00:28:37,377 --> 00:28:39,412
He didn't
call 911.

00:28:39,479 --> 00:28:41,514
He called Dominic Humphreys.

00:28:44,784 --> 00:28:45,919
He made a mistake.

00:28:48,721 --> 00:28:50,957
But he's not killer.

00:28:55,094 --> 00:28:57,597
Well, your suspicions
are correct.

00:28:57,664 --> 00:28:59,566
Matty was being
poisoned.

00:28:59,632 --> 00:29:01,267
Boric acid.

00:29:01,334 --> 00:29:03,503
50 micrograms per milliliter.

00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:05,939
ALT levels
over a 1,000.

00:29:06,005 --> 00:29:07,640
BUN levels 86.

00:29:07,707 --> 00:29:09,375
Her kidneys are shutting down.

00:29:09,442 --> 00:29:11,377
Based on the level
of organ damage, I'd say

00:29:11,444 --> 00:29:13,713
that she's been ingesting it
for about eight weeks.

00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:14,881
Do you know
the source?

00:29:14,948 --> 00:29:16,382
Not yet.

00:29:16,449 --> 00:29:18,184
You're putting her on dialysis?

00:29:18,251 --> 00:29:20,053
That's about all we can do
at this point.

00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:22,388
Can you tell me if there's
any permanent organ damage?

00:29:22,455 --> 00:29:24,224
Not yet.

00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:26,226
Thank you.
Okay.

00:30:20,747 --> 00:30:22,749
(whirring)

00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:27,987
WILLOWS:
<i>How's Matty?</i>

00:30:28,054 --> 00:30:29,789
She'll live,
but they haven't

00:30:29,856 --> 00:30:31,357
ruled out
permanent damage.

00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,425
Langston.

00:30:32,492 --> 00:30:34,194
I found trace levels
of boric acid

00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,563
in Amber Jones' blood
and organs.

00:30:36,629 --> 00:30:38,031
Consistent
with a one-time dose.

00:30:38,097 --> 00:30:39,232
Well, low levels

00:30:39,299 --> 00:30:40,667
don't rule out
chronic poisoning.

00:30:40,733 --> 00:30:42,635
Right, the only way
to confirm how long

00:30:42,702 --> 00:30:44,370
she was being poisoned
is through hair analysis.

00:30:44,437 --> 00:30:45,805
And the only way
to do that

00:30:45,872 --> 00:30:47,674
is for us to get
some of her hair.

00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:50,109
I'll get a warrant
to exhume the body.

00:30:50,176 --> 00:30:52,278
I think Amber
was the target

00:30:52,345 --> 00:30:54,047
and her daughter
was collateral damage.

00:30:54,113 --> 00:30:55,949
Well, if poisoning was
the weapon of choice,

00:30:56,015 --> 00:30:57,951
why change weapons
and shoot her?

00:30:58,017 --> 00:31:00,286
All right, let's say
I'm the killer.

00:31:00,353 --> 00:31:02,722
I decide to poison Amber.

00:31:02,789 --> 00:31:05,458
She doesn't die,
so I panic.

00:31:05,525 --> 00:31:07,327
And I shoot her.

00:31:07,393 --> 00:31:09,195
Okay.

00:31:09,262 --> 00:31:12,098
Amber's been dead
eight weeks,

00:31:12,165 --> 00:31:15,301
yet her daughter is still
being exposed to the poison,

00:31:15,368 --> 00:31:19,572
so the source has got
to be in their house.

00:31:23,042 --> 00:31:24,544
Got to be hard to sleep

00:31:24,611 --> 00:31:26,679
in the same house
where your mom was killed.

00:31:26,746 --> 00:31:28,681
Well, they say
kids are resilient.

00:31:28,748 --> 00:31:30,083
Nobody's that
resilient.

00:31:30,149 --> 00:31:32,051
She's probably
blaming herself.

00:31:32,118 --> 00:31:33,586
SANDERS:
Voice of
experience?

00:31:33,653 --> 00:31:37,123
Boric acid can be ingested
or absorbed through the skin.

00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:40,059
I'm gonna go check out
the shampoos and body washes.

00:31:40,126 --> 00:31:42,128
All right.

00:31:43,696 --> 00:31:45,265
Is Riley all right?

00:31:45,331 --> 00:31:48,902
I think this whole case has,
uh, hit a nerve.

00:31:48,968 --> 00:31:50,737
Well, she's not shy.

00:31:50,803 --> 00:31:53,206
If she wanted to talk about it,
she would.

00:31:55,275 --> 00:31:57,243
Source of the poison
has to be something

00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,745
that's been around
for at least

00:31:58,811 --> 00:32:00,280
two months.

00:32:00,346 --> 00:32:01,781
I'll start with
any open items.

00:32:32,312 --> 00:32:34,314
♪ ♪

00:32:47,794 --> 00:32:50,163
We have a winner.

00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:52,465
Looks like somebody tampered
with their drink mix.

00:32:56,302 --> 00:32:58,471
Purchased at Skadden Pharmacy.

00:33:04,177 --> 00:33:06,946
Well, it looks like
she usually shopped

00:33:07,013 --> 00:33:08,448
at Nathan's Market.

00:33:08,515 --> 00:33:10,650
You don't buy food at a pharmacy

00:33:10,717 --> 00:33:14,087
unless you're there
picking something else up.

00:33:14,153 --> 00:33:18,424
Hey, did you find any,
uh, prescription meds?

00:33:18,491 --> 00:33:21,561
Just an antibiotic
and a hydrocodone.

00:33:25,865 --> 00:33:27,667
You got something?

00:33:27,734 --> 00:33:29,802
Yeah.

00:33:29,869 --> 00:33:31,137
This prescription was filled

00:33:31,204 --> 00:33:33,039
the night
before Amber was murdered.

00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:49,189
Thank you.

00:33:50,523 --> 00:33:52,859
David, would you hand me
a rubber band, please?

00:33:52,926 --> 00:33:54,961
Yeah.

00:33:55,028 --> 00:33:56,329
Thank you.

00:34:01,201 --> 00:34:03,403
(sighs)

00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:06,606
I'll get this
to Henry stat.

00:34:06,673 --> 00:34:08,308
Good.

00:34:11,711 --> 00:34:13,880
Matty looks just like
her mother.

00:34:26,359 --> 00:34:28,027
Did you note this at autopsy?

00:34:28,094 --> 00:34:30,964
If I had, no way
I would have cut through it.

00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:32,198
It must have developed later.

00:34:32,265 --> 00:34:36,002
Embalming fluid can enhance
discoloration.

00:34:37,937 --> 00:34:40,106
(mechanical whirring)

00:34:40,173 --> 00:34:42,175
(liquid sloshing)

00:34:46,312 --> 00:34:49,382
(mechanical clicking)

00:34:49,449 --> 00:34:52,252
Contusion had
to have occurred perimortem.

00:34:52,318 --> 00:34:53,586
Otherwise, the bruise

00:34:53,653 --> 00:34:55,655
would have blossomed
earlier.

00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:01,294
It's a shoe impression.

00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:03,934
Jurors, have you reached
a verdict?

00:35:04,001 --> 00:35:07,571
MAN:
Yes, Your Honor,
we have.

00:35:07,638 --> 00:35:10,341
JUDGE:
Will the defendant please rise?

00:35:10,407 --> 00:35:13,344
"In the matter
of <i>State of Nevada</i>

00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:15,112
<i>"v. Edward Griffin,</i>

00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:17,314
"we the jury find
the defendant guilty

00:35:17,381 --> 00:35:18,749
of murder in
the first degree."

00:35:18,816 --> 00:35:20,150
(gasps and scattered applause)
Settle down.

00:35:20,217 --> 00:35:21,452
(bangs gavel)
Quiet!

00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:23,254
Please remand the
defendant into custody.

00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,890
(shocked murmuring)

00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,728
(sighs)

00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,702
MAN (on TV):
We're live at the courthouse,
where, just moments ago,


00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:40,938
Congressman Griffin
was remanded into custody


00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:42,173
after he was convicted


00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:44,241
in the murder
of local resident Amber...


00:35:46,043 --> 00:35:47,144
(sighs)

00:35:47,211 --> 00:35:48,445
Oh, we got
a conviction.

00:35:48,512 --> 00:35:49,613
Jury came
back quick.

00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,182
Well, this case
isn't over yet.

00:35:51,248 --> 00:35:53,684
I called the pharmacist
at Skadden's.

00:35:53,751 --> 00:35:55,352
On the night before Amber died,

00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:57,555
the emergency room doc
called in two prescriptions--

00:35:57,621 --> 00:35:59,356
an antibiotic
and a painkiller.

00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:01,959
They were picked up and paid for
by Dominic Humphreys.

00:36:02,026 --> 00:36:05,763
Well, he took her to the
E.R. and then drove her home.

00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,264
Yeah, but the meds
weren't the only thing

00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:08,499
he picked up.
Check it out.

00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:14,271
Bandages, medical tape,

00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:16,874
antibiotic ointment,
energy drink mix,

00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:18,242
crackers, soup.

00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:19,643
Roach poison?

00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:24,648
<i>Humphreys was the one</i>
<i>trying to poison her?</i>

00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:27,418
And then the congressman
decided to shoot her?

00:36:27,484 --> 00:36:29,720
That's what it looks like.
Obviously,

00:36:29,787 --> 00:36:31,889
he didn't care that
he poisoned her daughter, too.

00:36:31,956 --> 00:36:35,092
We found new evidence
on Amber Jones' body.

00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:36,393
You got to be kidding me.

00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,795
Shoe impression bruise.

00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,763
Developed after
the embalming.

00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:41,765
It's only seven inches long.

00:36:41,832 --> 00:36:43,734
Well, it has to belong
to the killer.

00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:44,935
Can't be the congressman's.

00:36:45,002 --> 00:36:46,136
Seven inches-- that's
got to be female.

00:36:46,203 --> 00:36:48,072
The only female with access

00:36:48,138 --> 00:36:50,107
to the murder weapon
is Mrs. Griffin.

00:36:50,174 --> 00:36:52,276
(groaning)

00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:55,346
Did the wife have an alibi
from 4:00 to 5:00?

00:36:55,412 --> 00:36:56,814
I remember Mrs. Griffin
telling Brass

00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:59,316
that she was in bed recovering
from a miscarriage.

00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:01,051
Her hormones are already
in overdrive,

00:37:01,118 --> 00:37:02,987
and then she catches
her husband cheating.

00:37:03,053 --> 00:37:04,922
She might have caught more
than that.

00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:07,191
Amber gave the congressman
chlamydia.

00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:09,093
I think he gave it
to his wife.

00:37:09,159 --> 00:37:11,462
Chlamydia can cause
a miscarriage.

00:37:11,529 --> 00:37:12,796
Well, that's one hell
of a motive.

00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:14,331
WILLOWS:
This bruise is
not specific enough

00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:15,533
to identify the shoe.

00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:16,834
STOKES:
No, but we can
get a warrant

00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,002
for her clothes.

00:37:18,068 --> 00:37:20,271
Maybe we can match the fibers
from the gun slide.

00:37:20,337 --> 00:37:21,672
Call the ADA

00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:24,208
Let her know that she won't
be taking tomorrow off.

00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:25,809
All right.

00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:28,646
(sighs)

00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:34,585
WILLOWS:
We found these gloves
in your closet.

00:37:34,652 --> 00:37:38,822
Blue-black dye,
wool and cashmere blend.

00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:40,791
It proves you
killed Amber Jones.

00:37:40,858 --> 00:37:42,793
WHITTEN:
You two need
to watch the news.

00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,895
Her husband
was just found guilty.

00:37:44,962 --> 00:37:46,330
WILLOWS:
Hey, I get it.

00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:48,465
You lost your baby
because he couldn't

00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:49,633
keep it in his pants.

00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:50,701
BRASS:
Your husband's

00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:51,869
conviction will be overturned.

00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,237
That's the good news.
The bad news

00:37:53,304 --> 00:37:55,806
is, unless you talk to us,
you'll be the one on trial.

00:37:55,873 --> 00:37:57,575
You don't have
to say a word to these people.

00:37:57,641 --> 00:38:00,411
I can't go through this again.

00:38:09,019 --> 00:38:12,523
I had... just come back
from seeing my doctor,

00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,592
and I needed to talk
to my husband.

00:38:16,594 --> 00:38:18,796
But he wasn't home.

00:38:18,863 --> 00:38:20,998
I saw his wallet on the dresser.

00:38:21,065 --> 00:38:23,501
That meant he was downstairs.

00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:25,069
<i>He had cheated before.</i>

00:38:25,135 --> 00:38:27,505
<i>But when he ran for office,</i>
<i>we made a deal.</i>

00:38:27,571 --> 00:38:29,173
<i>He could look, but not touch.</i>

00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,775
<i>I'm the one who hit</i>
<i>the little bitch, not him.</i>

00:38:31,842 --> 00:38:33,644
(screams)

00:38:34,845 --> 00:38:37,648
But you didn't stop there,
right?

00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:42,553
The next morning...

00:38:45,556 --> 00:38:47,558
...my doctor called
and told me...

00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,562
...I had chlamydia.

00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:56,901
(crying):
That's what killed my baby.

00:38:58,435 --> 00:39:00,971
I'm 40 years old.

00:39:01,038 --> 00:39:02,806
We had been trying
to get pregnant

00:39:02,873 --> 00:39:04,875
for over three years.

00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,512
It was my last chance.

00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:12,449
Yeah. My last chance
to be a mother.

00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:21,458
Then I...

00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:23,494
I found my husband's
cell phone bill,

00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:25,062
and I just started
calling numbers

00:39:25,129 --> 00:39:26,931
until I found hers.

00:39:26,997 --> 00:39:28,799
Do you want something
to drink?

00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:30,634
Yeah, thank you.

00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:32,636
<i>I told her I was there</i>
<i>to apologize.</i>

00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:35,806
<i>That I'd been thinking</i>
<i>about it all night.</i>

00:39:36,907 --> 00:39:39,476
No! (groans)

00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:43,080
(panting)

00:39:43,147 --> 00:39:45,349
(whimpering)

00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:46,984
Please. Please
don't kill me.

00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:49,119
Please. Please!
I have a daughter!

00:39:49,186 --> 00:39:50,955
(grunts)

00:39:51,021 --> 00:39:53,757
Because of you,
my daughter is dead.

00:39:53,824 --> 00:39:56,961
(gunshots)

00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:02,933
So you left,
but you forgot the gun?

00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,770
You figured Dominic would
clean up after you, too.

00:40:06,837 --> 00:40:10,374
No, Dominic didn't know anything
about it.

00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:13,711
He would never help me.

00:40:13,777 --> 00:40:15,145
He always thought

00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:17,982
I was a liability
to my husband's career.

00:40:18,048 --> 00:40:22,119
So when did your husband realize
that you... killed Amber?

00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:24,421
(inhales deeply)

00:40:24,488 --> 00:40:28,092
As soon as you told him
his gun was missing.

00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:33,430
You have an STD.

00:40:33,497 --> 00:40:35,499
You should go to the doctor.

00:40:37,067 --> 00:40:39,003
WILLOWS:
<i>I don't know.</i>

00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:41,338
I would have killed him,

00:40:41,405 --> 00:40:43,407
not her.

00:40:49,413 --> 00:40:51,582
(crowd chatter and laughter)

00:40:51,649 --> 00:40:53,484
All right.

00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:55,286
Matty's going to be all right.

00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:56,820
No permanent damage.

00:40:56,887 --> 00:40:58,088
Glad to hear it.

00:40:58,155 --> 00:41:00,090
Ray.

00:41:00,157 --> 00:41:01,659
You deserve this.

00:41:01,725 --> 00:41:03,260
Thank you, Catherine.

00:41:03,327 --> 00:41:05,062
Talk about
baptism by fire.

00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,864
Yeah, but you made
it through it.

00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:08,098
You never quit.

00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:10,901
Do you think
she really dropped the gun?

00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:13,170
Or do you think
she left it there to frame him?

00:41:13,237 --> 00:41:15,439
My money's
on the frame.

00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:17,474
I think
she dropped it.

00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:19,009
Heat of the moment.

00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:21,412
Or maybe both things are true.

00:41:21,478 --> 00:41:22,813
She accidentally
dropped the gun,

00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,416
and then decided to leave it
there to punish him.

00:41:25,482 --> 00:41:26,717
WILLOWS:
Well, we'll
never know.

00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:29,787
But what we do know--

00:41:29,854 --> 00:41:30,955
Ray got it right.

00:41:31,021 --> 00:41:32,456
Yeah.

00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:33,924
Ray had a lot of help.

00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:35,092
(laughter)

00:41:38,262 --> 00:41:41,198
WILLOWS:
Teamwork.
SANDERS:
Makes the dream work.
