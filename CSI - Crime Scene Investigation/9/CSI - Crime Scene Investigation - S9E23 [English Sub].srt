00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:04,104
(engines revving)

00:00:19,065 --> 00:00:22,002
(whooping)

00:00:32,746 --> 00:00:34,781
(riders clamoring)

00:00:36,249 --> 00:00:38,318
(cackles)

00:00:41,703 --> 00:00:43,205
Ready for a good night?

00:00:43,272 --> 00:00:44,473
You know I am, baby.

00:00:47,676 --> 00:00:49,711
(rock music playing)

00:00:51,847 --> 00:00:54,316
Watch out, fellas. Watch out.

00:00:54,383 --> 00:00:55,918
Hey, Rudy!

00:00:55,984 --> 00:00:57,686
How's it going,
brother?

00:00:57,753 --> 00:00:59,154
Hook us up with two.

00:01:00,422 --> 00:01:01,757
Here you go, Joey.

00:01:06,862 --> 00:01:08,931
Yo, Death! You wanna shoot?

00:01:08,997 --> 00:01:10,599
I'm broke.

00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:12,034
I'll spot you, brother.

00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,969
Ha-ha, brother!

00:01:14,036 --> 00:01:15,771
Huh!

00:01:15,837 --> 00:01:19,508
(indistinct conversations)

00:01:20,842 --> 00:01:24,012
Joey, check it out.

00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:26,815
Talk about easy rider.

00:01:26,882 --> 00:01:28,450
Hey, you got a ride
like this, man,

00:01:28,517 --> 00:01:30,919
you got to stay on it.

00:01:36,625 --> 00:01:38,093
(man chuckling)

00:01:40,095 --> 00:01:42,998
I'm going to kick
your ass, Hooper!

00:01:43,065 --> 00:01:44,800
(grunting and groaning)

00:01:44,867 --> 00:01:46,335
(clanging, glass shattering)

00:01:46,401 --> 00:01:47,402
(laughing)

00:01:47,469 --> 00:01:49,171
It's all family love here.

00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,909
Come on, Jackass,
Get in there!

00:01:56,478 --> 00:01:59,448
(grunting and groaning)

00:02:03,318 --> 00:02:05,354
(sirens blaring)

00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,056
(clamoring)
(engines revving)

00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,528
(tires squealing)

00:02:13,595 --> 00:02:17,099
(weapons locking and loading)

00:02:17,165 --> 00:02:20,936
(officers shouting commands)

00:02:21,003 --> 00:02:22,638
(tires squeal)

00:02:24,907 --> 00:02:27,376
OFFICER:
Let me see your hands! Up!

00:02:27,442 --> 00:02:29,444
Let's go, keep it moving.

00:02:30,812 --> 00:02:32,848
BRASS:
So, a radio car was
in the neighborhood.

00:02:32,915 --> 00:02:34,683
Picked up a 911 call
from dispatch.

00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,052
A 911 call
for a biker bar fight?

00:02:37,119 --> 00:02:38,687
(chuckles) Did you
run the number?

00:02:38,754 --> 00:02:40,689
Untraceable cell.

00:02:40,756 --> 00:02:41,723
MAN:
Yo, pig!

00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:43,559
Don't you touch my hog!

00:02:47,029 --> 00:02:48,997
Close the door.

00:02:52,267 --> 00:02:53,869
LANGSTON:
What do we have,
David?

00:02:53,936 --> 00:02:55,204
Liver stick's 98.

00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,338
No rigor.

00:02:56,405 --> 00:02:57,806
Lividity
isn't fixed.

00:02:57,873 --> 00:02:59,575
They don't get much fresher.

00:02:59,641 --> 00:03:01,476
(camera shutter clicking)

00:03:03,045 --> 00:03:04,947
"Vegas Blasters."

00:03:05,013 --> 00:03:06,949
BRASS:
He's flying his colors.

00:03:07,015 --> 00:03:09,384
That means he's a sworn member
of the gang.

00:03:09,451 --> 00:03:11,853
David, would you
turn him over for me, please?

00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,422
Sure thing.

00:03:19,394 --> 00:03:20,729
Whoa.

00:03:20,796 --> 00:03:22,297
Multiple knife wounds.

00:03:22,364 --> 00:03:25,133
Takes a serious blade to cut
through leather like that.

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,635
(groaning)

00:03:27,669 --> 00:03:28,937
The knife's sheath

00:03:29,004 --> 00:03:30,439
on his belt's empty.

00:03:30,505 --> 00:03:32,140
He was probably trying
to defend himself.

00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:34,376
Do we know who he is?

00:03:34,443 --> 00:03:36,078
No wallet, no ID,
and apparently,

00:03:36,144 --> 00:03:37,980
there were no eyewitnesses.

00:03:38,046 --> 00:03:40,282
We have a packed club.

00:03:40,349 --> 00:03:42,451
Nobody knows what happened?

00:03:42,517 --> 00:03:45,053
When nobody knows nothing...

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,656
somebody knows something.

(sniffs)


00:04:30,215 --> 00:04:31,450
Mmm, what's that scent?


00:04:31,517 --> 00:04:32,751
Beer, urine,


00:04:32,818 --> 00:04:35,254
sweat, vomit...


00:04:36,288 --> 00:04:37,756
And death.


00:04:37,823 --> 00:04:39,691
A lot of people think these guys


00:04:39,758 --> 00:04:42,194
just run holiday toy drives
and host rallies


00:04:42,261 --> 00:04:43,729
for kids
with cancer.


00:04:43,796 --> 00:04:46,865
In a magic act, that would
be called a misdirection.


00:04:46,932 --> 00:04:48,400
I'd call this a slaughter.


00:04:48,467 --> 00:04:50,736
All this blood, one victim?


00:04:50,803 --> 00:04:52,938
I'm thinking it started


00:04:53,005 --> 00:04:56,708
back there
by the second pool table,


00:04:56,775 --> 00:04:59,011
moved up
through this blood pool,


00:04:59,077 --> 00:05:01,680
where I found the chain,


00:05:01,747 --> 00:05:04,383
and ended about here,


00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:06,285
where we found the body.


00:05:06,351 --> 00:05:08,554
I still can't make any sense
of all these bloody footprints.


00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:09,688
SANDERS:
We'll compare them


00:05:09,755 --> 00:05:12,024
to the shoes
of our guys in custody.


00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:14,960
Meanwhile, I'll start
collecting blood samples.


00:05:15,027 --> 00:05:17,529
The police arrived minutes
after the 911 call,


00:05:17,596 --> 00:05:20,199
so the weapon or weapons
may still be here.


00:05:20,265 --> 00:05:21,300
I'll check the kitchen.


00:05:21,366 --> 00:05:22,801
Good place to ditch a knife.


00:05:22,868 --> 00:05:24,570
(sighs)


00:05:24,636 --> 00:05:27,072
I want to go take a look
at the bikes


00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:29,942
before they go
to impound.


00:05:30,976 --> 00:05:33,011
Longhorns, nice.


00:05:36,381 --> 00:05:38,884
Beautiful.


00:05:38,951 --> 00:05:41,386
Beautiful machines.


00:05:41,453 --> 00:05:42,621
Okay, thank you.


00:05:42,688 --> 00:05:44,156
First time
I've ever


00:05:44,223 --> 00:05:45,357
coveted physical evidence.


00:05:45,424 --> 00:05:46,658
Well, I ran
the plates


00:05:46,725 --> 00:05:48,727
on all of them, and they
all came back matched


00:05:48,794 --> 00:05:50,162
to the people
we have in custody,


00:05:50,229 --> 00:05:52,131
except for
this one here.
The victim's bike?


00:05:52,197 --> 00:05:53,232
Possibly.


00:05:53,298 --> 00:05:55,434
R.O.'s come back
a Joseph Niagra.


00:05:55,501 --> 00:05:56,468
Do we have a home address?


00:05:56,535 --> 00:05:58,604
You're standing
in front of it.


00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,038
But I'll run him
through the system.


00:06:00,105 --> 00:06:01,106
All these guys
have records.


00:06:01,173 --> 00:06:03,008
I tell these kids,
"You want to join a gang?


00:06:03,075 --> 00:06:04,276
"You should join us.


00:06:04,343 --> 00:06:07,513
"We're more powerful.
We got bigger guns...


00:06:07,579 --> 00:06:09,014
and we got dental."


00:06:09,081 --> 00:06:11,617
Sold me.


00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,234
♪ ♪


00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:46,185
Hmm.


00:06:46,251 --> 00:06:47,286
How's it going here?


00:06:47,352 --> 00:06:49,721
Well, every single one
of these knives


00:06:49,788 --> 00:06:51,390
tested positive for blood.


00:06:51,457 --> 00:06:54,660
These are animal,
and these are human.


00:06:54,726 --> 00:06:56,462
SANDERS: You should get
these back to the lab.


00:06:56,528 --> 00:06:58,130
They need you
at PD.


00:06:58,197 --> 00:07:00,699
(water running)


00:07:03,635 --> 00:07:05,204
Oh, Tonya.


00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:08,073
You should have listened
to your mother.


00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,275
(camera shutter clicking)


00:07:12,244 --> 00:07:15,481
When I was in high school,
there was this guy, Mark.


00:07:15,547 --> 00:07:17,182
He had a motorcycle.


00:07:17,249 --> 00:07:18,717
(camera shutter clicking)
Let me guess.


00:07:18,784 --> 00:07:20,686
Your mom told you
to stay away from him,


00:07:20,752 --> 00:07:22,521
but you were Romeo and Juliet,


00:07:22,588 --> 00:07:24,990
riding around
on 600 pounds of steel.


00:07:25,057 --> 00:07:26,458
Oh, we had fun.


00:07:26,525 --> 00:07:28,093
(chuckles)


00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,661
But I moved on.


00:07:29,728 --> 00:07:32,164
In fact, I didn't
give bikers another thought


00:07:32,231 --> 00:07:33,365
until, years later,


00:07:33,432 --> 00:07:36,802
I'm in the ER
with a hit-and-run victim.


00:07:36,869 --> 00:07:38,604
Guy on a bike.


00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:41,907
Just a piece of meat
in search of a pulse.


00:07:43,408 --> 00:07:45,277
The entire time
I'm processing him,


00:07:45,344 --> 00:07:47,446
I never realized
it was my Romeo.


00:07:47,513 --> 00:07:49,214
He was that beat up.


00:07:49,281 --> 00:07:53,218
Final stab wound tally: 24.


00:07:53,285 --> 00:07:55,254
Multiple abrasions,

00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,655
hematomas.

00:07:58,290 --> 00:07:59,792
This one's got
a looping pattern.

00:07:59,858 --> 00:08:02,828
Ray said that he found a chain
at the scene.

00:08:10,102 --> 00:08:12,037
It's a good way
of slowing somebody down.

00:08:12,104 --> 00:08:15,674
Maybe he needed
slowing down.

00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,444
Take a look
at the teeth.

00:08:19,511 --> 00:08:21,547
This is your mouth on meth.

00:08:21,613 --> 00:08:23,749
(beeping)

00:08:23,816 --> 00:08:25,384
Joseph Niagra.

00:08:25,451 --> 00:08:28,187
Same as the R.O.
on the unclaimed bike.

00:08:31,557 --> 00:08:34,860
(murmuring)

00:08:38,063 --> 00:08:39,832
HODGES:
Right hand.

00:08:48,874 --> 00:08:51,710

WOMAN:
Turn around, please.

00:08:55,747 --> 00:08:57,516
Thank you.

00:08:58,851 --> 00:09:01,353
MAN: Yeah, yeah,
I heard you, I heard you.

00:09:03,489 --> 00:09:05,324
Okay, would you please open

00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,592
your mouth, Mister...

00:09:06,658 --> 00:09:08,460
Jackass.
MITCHELL:
Shut up.

00:09:08,527 --> 00:09:09,795
Get off me!

00:09:10,829 --> 00:09:13,265
It's my name.
Okay.

00:09:13,332 --> 00:09:16,735
Would you please open
your mouth, Mr. Jackass?

00:09:19,905 --> 00:09:21,707

Next in line?

00:09:21,773 --> 00:09:23,342
Thank you.

00:09:26,712 --> 00:09:28,247
Right hand.

00:09:38,891 --> 00:09:40,759
(sighs)

00:09:41,794 --> 00:09:42,995
WEBSTER:
There's so much grease

00:09:43,061 --> 00:09:44,429
on these paws.

00:09:44,496 --> 00:09:45,697
I can't get a clean print.

00:09:45,764 --> 00:09:47,199
MAN: I work in a
body shop.

00:09:47,266 --> 00:09:48,700
What do you expect?

00:10:03,449 --> 00:10:05,050
Excuse me.

00:10:05,117 --> 00:10:07,319
All right, you know what?
Could you just...?

00:10:07,386 --> 00:10:08,520
Okay, here.

00:10:08,587 --> 00:10:10,389
Could you
maybe just...

00:10:12,825 --> 00:10:15,194
Okay, Badger,
what happened last night?

00:10:17,095 --> 00:10:18,263
Did Joey Niagra

00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:20,532
do something to piss you off?

00:10:22,634 --> 00:10:24,203
What is this,

00:10:24,269 --> 00:10:26,371
the biker code of silence?

00:10:28,173 --> 00:10:29,341
You're the
only member

00:10:29,408 --> 00:10:31,944
of the gang who wasn't
carrying a weapon.

00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:33,745
They're not a gang.

00:10:35,314 --> 00:10:37,616
They're just a bunch of guys
that like to ride together.

00:10:37,683 --> 00:10:39,618
But you're the only bartender
in South Vegas

00:10:39,685 --> 00:10:41,086
who doesn't carry protection.

00:10:41,153 --> 00:10:44,022
(chuckles softly)
Man...

00:10:44,089 --> 00:10:47,025
you got to start looking
for a better class of bar.

00:10:47,092 --> 00:10:49,328
You're going to be looking
<i>through</i> bars for a long time.

00:10:49,394 --> 00:10:51,096
Get him out of here.

00:11:03,675 --> 00:11:05,677
And now your boots.

00:11:08,147 --> 00:11:09,815
When you're done
with fingerprinting,

00:11:09,882 --> 00:11:11,750
the officer will take you
to another room

00:11:11,817 --> 00:11:13,318
where he'll collect
the rest of your clothing.

00:11:16,288 --> 00:11:17,289
I ain't stripping.

00:11:17,356 --> 00:11:18,957
I promise you, jail scrubs are

00:11:19,024 --> 00:11:21,593
much cleaner and more flattering
than the blood-and-grease-soaked

00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,895
homicide evidence
that you're currently wearing.

00:11:22,961 --> 00:11:24,463
Let's go, Jackass.

00:11:25,697 --> 00:11:26,932
SIMMS:
Tonya Charles?

00:11:26,999 --> 00:11:28,066
Would you open
your mouth, please?

00:11:28,133 --> 00:11:29,568
Stick it in your
own mouth, bitch.

00:11:29,635 --> 00:11:31,370
Hey! Hey!

00:11:31,436 --> 00:11:32,471
You're out of line.

00:11:32,538 --> 00:11:33,939
Bite my out-of-line ass.
You owe Ms. Simms

00:11:34,006 --> 00:11:35,574
an apology.
No, Hodges, it's okay.

00:11:35,641 --> 00:11:38,010
No, apologize.

00:11:38,076 --> 00:11:39,077
(Hodges groans,
spectators laughing)

00:11:39,144 --> 00:11:40,846
Uh-oh.

00:11:40,913 --> 00:11:42,714
TONYA:
Get your hands off me!
OFFICER: Settle down!

00:11:42,781 --> 00:11:43,682
WOMAN:
Yeah, girl!

00:11:43,749 --> 00:11:45,451
That was stupid.
(handcuffs click)

00:11:45,517 --> 00:11:47,019
Ugh, chivalry is not dead.

00:11:47,085 --> 00:11:50,055
No, but its nose
is bleeding.

00:11:50,122 --> 00:11:51,757
(grunting)

00:11:51,824 --> 00:11:53,125
Hold on a second.

00:11:53,192 --> 00:11:54,827
(panting)

00:11:54,893 --> 00:11:55,961
"Property
of Joey."

00:11:56,028 --> 00:11:57,296
Is it Joey Niagra?

00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:20,686
The victim's bike?

00:12:20,752 --> 00:12:21,887
Yes.

00:12:21,954 --> 00:12:24,923
Lots of greasy prints.

00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:27,993
Look, I found this iPod.

00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:31,029
It's got an
AM-FM receiver

00:12:31,096 --> 00:12:33,065
and a very interesting playlist.

00:12:33,132 --> 00:12:34,833
What do you got
for me?

00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,970
Joey Niagra popped up in CODIS.

00:12:38,036 --> 00:12:40,405
He was connected
to an open homicide:

00:12:40,472 --> 00:12:41,540
dead hooker.

00:12:41,607 --> 00:12:43,742
I guess
he was her last trick.

00:12:43,809 --> 00:12:44,743
Definitely.

00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:46,512
Sex was postmortem.

00:12:46,578 --> 00:12:49,248
Some kind of initiation rite,
no doubt.

00:12:49,314 --> 00:12:50,883
Kill the hooker;
have sex with the body;

00:12:50,949 --> 00:12:53,085
get your colors
on your bike.

00:12:53,152 --> 00:12:55,254
I'm almost done processing here.

00:13:01,093 --> 00:13:02,961
What is that?

00:13:12,604 --> 00:13:13,839
Huh.

00:13:15,707 --> 00:13:16,775
Well...

00:13:16,842 --> 00:13:18,443
"J.N."

00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:20,078
Joey's missing knife.

00:13:20,145 --> 00:13:21,313
He didn't put it there.

00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,348
It's been wiped clean.

00:13:23,415 --> 00:13:25,451
Someone's trying
to send us a message.

00:13:25,517 --> 00:13:26,485
Yeah.

00:13:26,552 --> 00:13:27,953
"Shove it."

00:13:30,722 --> 00:13:31,657
ECKLIE:
Jim.

00:13:31,723 --> 00:13:33,292
Yeah, what's up?

00:13:33,358 --> 00:13:35,027
Got an alert
from Records Bureau

00:13:35,093 --> 00:13:36,428
you ran prints
on Joey Niagra.

00:13:36,495 --> 00:13:37,896
An alert?

00:13:37,963 --> 00:13:38,897
Yeah.

00:13:38,964 --> 00:13:41,800
His real name's Jack Nettles.

00:13:41,867 --> 00:13:43,302
Vice recruited him two years ago

00:13:43,368 --> 00:13:45,337
from Indianapolis
for an undercover job.

00:13:45,404 --> 00:13:47,539
So what's going on?

00:13:47,606 --> 00:13:49,141
The Vegas Blasters homicide.

00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:50,609
He's the victim.

00:13:50,676 --> 00:13:54,713
What kind of cop is a
tweaking necrophiliac?

00:13:58,638 --> 00:13:59,673
It's tough giving
this kind of news

00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:00,907
to the wife
of a victim.
Yeah, well,

00:14:00,974 --> 00:14:02,709
I'll try to spare her
too many details.

00:14:02,776 --> 00:14:04,778
Well...

00:14:14,496 --> 00:14:15,337
Rita.

00:14:15,404 --> 00:14:16,839
What are you...?

00:14:19,529 --> 00:14:22,132
Mrs. Nettles, I'm

00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:25,235
Conrad Ecklie,
Las Vegas Undersheriff.

00:14:25,302 --> 00:14:27,504
Oh, uh, please come in.

00:14:37,347 --> 00:14:38,582
I'm sorry

00:14:38,648 --> 00:14:40,150
to have to
inform you that,

00:14:40,217 --> 00:14:43,420
uh, your husband...

00:14:43,487 --> 00:14:44,621
(sobbing):
No.

00:14:44,688 --> 00:14:46,523
Oh, God.

00:14:48,158 --> 00:14:51,361
Oh, my God!

00:14:51,428 --> 00:14:55,599
Oh, my God, no!

00:14:57,901 --> 00:14:59,436
Your husband
was killed

00:14:59,503 --> 00:15:01,605
during an undercover operation.

00:15:01,672 --> 00:15:04,608
Captain Brass is in charge
of the murder investigation.

00:15:04,675 --> 00:15:06,643
(sniffles)

00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:07,644
I'm very sorry

00:15:07,711 --> 00:15:09,346
for your loss, ma'am.

00:15:09,413 --> 00:15:11,848
My loss?

00:15:13,283 --> 00:15:15,953
This...

00:15:18,488 --> 00:15:20,524
This is <i>who</i> I lost...

00:15:22,526 --> 00:15:24,461
...over six months ago

00:15:24,528 --> 00:15:28,332
when he turned into someone
I didn't recognize anymore.

00:15:31,601 --> 00:15:33,537
Jim, when did it happen?

00:15:33,604 --> 00:15:34,871
Last night.

00:15:34,938 --> 00:15:37,674
It happened
last night.

00:15:38,775 --> 00:15:42,112
I tried to see his captain
last night.

00:15:42,179 --> 00:15:43,213
He's got to help me.

00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,615
He's got to get
my husband

00:15:44,681 --> 00:15:45,849
out of that gang.

00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:47,951
Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am.
I need his help.

00:15:48,018 --> 00:15:50,020
Captain Collins
is not available.

00:15:50,087 --> 00:15:51,888
Wha...?
Take a seat.

00:15:51,955 --> 00:15:54,024
You've had a
few too many.

00:15:54,091 --> 00:15:55,659
I'll have an officer
drive you home.
(groans)

00:15:55,726 --> 00:15:57,494
Okay?

00:15:57,561 --> 00:16:00,464
I'm sorry. I have to... I...

00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:02,699
(sobbing)

00:16:08,872 --> 00:16:11,008
You going to tell me
how you know her?

00:16:12,042 --> 00:16:14,211
No.

00:16:33,063 --> 00:16:36,566
SANDERS:
According to DNA, none of this
blood over here is the vic's.

00:16:36,633 --> 00:16:40,404
This is
from the biker named Hooper

00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:41,738
and this...

00:16:41,805 --> 00:16:44,541
is from Jackass.

00:16:45,776 --> 00:16:47,577
This could be

00:16:47,644 --> 00:16:49,513
from a fight
unrelated to the murder.

00:16:49,579 --> 00:16:52,683
Okay, well, I'm all set up here,
so let's try to confirm

00:16:52,749 --> 00:16:54,751
that those prints are
from our victim.

00:17:05,929 --> 00:17:07,431
(beeping)

00:17:27,184 --> 00:17:28,685
(groaning)

00:17:31,555 --> 00:17:34,491
It looks like he was
trying to get away,

00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:37,594
but we still don't know
who tried to kill him.

00:17:37,661 --> 00:17:40,897
Or how they found out
he was a cop.

00:17:40,964 --> 00:17:41,898
TONYA:
<i>Back off.</i>

00:17:41,965 --> 00:17:43,333
See if you like
being strip-searched

00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,003
as much as you like
shooting off your mouth.

00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:52,643
Good work, Willows.

00:17:52,709 --> 00:17:53,710
Ever work undercover?

00:17:53,777 --> 00:17:55,312
We can always use
another tough bitch.

00:17:55,379 --> 00:17:57,547
Okay.

00:17:57,614 --> 00:17:58,849
So with you
on the inside,

00:17:58,915 --> 00:18:00,083
when they threw
women at Nettles,

00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:01,752
he could always say
that he didn't cheat

00:18:01,818 --> 00:18:02,786
on his old lady,
right?

00:18:02,853 --> 00:18:04,087
Except for dead hookers. Right?

00:18:04,154 --> 00:18:07,591
Joey-- Jack-- had to do that.

00:18:07,658 --> 00:18:09,459
Had to be trusted enough
to become a member.

00:18:09,526 --> 00:18:11,495
Well, obviously something
happened to that trust.

00:18:11,561 --> 00:18:13,730
Jack was trying to learn
who the guy at the top is--

00:18:13,797 --> 00:18:14,931
the guy calling the shots

00:18:14,998 --> 00:18:16,800
in the drug racket
and the murders for hire.

00:18:16,867 --> 00:18:19,503
Only a couple in the inner
circle know his real identity.

00:18:19,569 --> 00:18:21,905
They don't use his real name.
He goes by Scratch.
Scratch...

00:18:21,972 --> 00:18:24,474
All right,
so what happened last night?

00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:26,977
We-We're in the clubhouse
after an all-day ride.

00:18:27,044 --> 00:18:29,513
C-Couple of fights,
nothing unusual.

00:18:29,579 --> 00:18:31,081
Then the bartender
takes a phone call.

00:18:31,148 --> 00:18:32,516
(snapping fingers):
Like that, atmosphere changes.

00:18:32,582 --> 00:18:33,717
It's real tense.

00:18:33,784 --> 00:18:36,687
♪ ♪

00:18:36,753 --> 00:18:39,423
(whistles)

00:18:40,457 --> 00:18:42,759
My guess: it's Scratch calling.

00:18:42,826 --> 00:18:44,027
Then, one of the "hangers"--

00:18:44,094 --> 00:18:45,429
guy who's not a member yet--

00:18:45,495 --> 00:18:47,631
he takes all the old ladies
and the rest of the hangers

00:18:47,698 --> 00:18:48,999
and he takes us all outside.

00:18:49,066 --> 00:18:52,035
Members only.
Outside.

00:18:54,938 --> 00:18:55,906
What time?

00:18:55,973 --> 00:18:58,508
About 10:00,
minute or two after.

00:18:58,575 --> 00:19:00,377
I'm cold.
I got to pee.

00:19:00,444 --> 00:19:01,712
Find a bush.

00:19:05,415 --> 00:19:06,950
(man groaning)

00:19:12,422 --> 00:19:14,992
(gasping)

00:19:18,829 --> 00:19:21,765
They just killed a guy
inside the Blasters' clubhouse--

00:19:21,832 --> 00:19:24,201
Rancho Destino,
south of Barston.

00:19:24,267 --> 00:19:26,703
Hurry... hurry.

00:19:28,772 --> 00:19:30,641
What are you looking at?

00:19:32,409 --> 00:19:34,244
Anybody see you make
that call?

00:19:34,311 --> 00:19:35,946
I don't think so.

00:19:36,013 --> 00:19:38,382
According to Vice,
Nettles' last report said

00:19:38,448 --> 00:19:40,684
there's a truckload of cocaine
coming in from Mexico.

00:19:40,751 --> 00:19:42,786
Yeah, only the West Side
bike gang Righteous Dogs

00:19:42,853 --> 00:19:43,620
got wind of it.

00:19:43,687 --> 00:19:44,888
It's going to be a war.

00:19:44,955 --> 00:19:46,423
Do you know where and when
this shipment is gonna

00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:49,259
take place?
Yeah-- no-- I-I'll find out.

00:19:49,326 --> 00:19:51,928
No, you won't, 'cause Ecklie
took you off the detail.

00:19:51,995 --> 00:19:53,297
What?!

00:19:53,363 --> 00:19:54,298
No!

00:19:54,364 --> 00:19:55,866
No.

00:19:55,932 --> 00:19:56,867
No way in hell, man!

00:19:56,933 --> 00:19:58,135
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hey.

00:19:58,201 --> 00:19:59,202
Hey!

00:19:59,269 --> 00:20:00,704
What are you on?

00:20:00,771 --> 00:20:02,005
What do you think?

00:20:02,072 --> 00:20:04,141
You picked me up
partying with bikers.

00:20:04,207 --> 00:20:05,909
Calm down. Calm down.

00:20:05,976 --> 00:20:07,544
What do you want me to do?

00:20:07,611 --> 00:20:09,880
I want you to get Ecklie in here

00:20:09,947 --> 00:20:13,250
so I can tell him
I ain't quitting.

00:20:13,317 --> 00:20:15,986
I'm not letting
Jack die in vain.

00:20:17,988 --> 00:20:20,257
C.O.D. was exsanguination.

00:20:20,324 --> 00:20:22,059
Found significant amount
of internal hemorrhage

00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:24,728
to the lung
and pleural cavity

00:20:24,795 --> 00:20:26,063
from stabs to the liver

00:20:26,129 --> 00:20:28,665
and mesentery.

00:20:28,732 --> 00:20:31,835
So he was alive and his heart
was beating the entire time?

00:20:31,902 --> 00:20:33,470
Until <i>it</i> was lacerated.

00:20:33,537 --> 00:20:35,806
It's one of the final injuries,
along with this one.

00:20:37,841 --> 00:20:39,576
Stab wound
to the left temple

00:20:39,643 --> 00:20:42,212
about, oh... two inches deep.

00:20:45,983 --> 00:20:48,785
Quite a lot
of stab marks.

00:20:48,852 --> 00:20:51,355
We need to compare these with
the weapons we've collected.

00:20:51,421 --> 00:20:53,123
I'll cut them all out
and send them upstairs.

00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:54,625
23 stab wounds.

00:20:54,691 --> 00:20:55,626
Twenty-four.

00:20:55,692 --> 00:20:57,794
I was thinking of Julius Caesar.

00:20:57,861 --> 00:21:01,098
Ah... history's
first recorded autopsy.

00:21:01,164 --> 00:21:04,001
Doctor named Antistius
did the honors, if I recall.

00:21:04,067 --> 00:21:06,903
On the body of a man betrayed

00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:09,573
by those he knew well.

00:21:37,234 --> 00:21:40,971
♪ ♪

00:22:00,123 --> 00:22:02,726
♪ ♪

00:22:31,655 --> 00:22:33,490
SIMMS:
The blood on the knife

00:22:33,557 --> 00:22:35,892
that you found in the motorcycle
seat was the victim's.

00:22:35,959 --> 00:22:37,761
STOKES: And I was able
to match that knife to

00:22:37,828 --> 00:22:40,497
two of his wounds: the stab to
the sternum and the left temple.

00:22:40,564 --> 00:22:41,898
What about the other knives?

00:22:41,965 --> 00:22:44,101
Double-edged,
serrated,

00:22:44,167 --> 00:22:45,269
smooth blade--

00:22:45,335 --> 00:22:46,770
none of which was a match

00:22:46,837 --> 00:22:48,905
to the tool marks
on the body.

00:22:48,972 --> 00:22:51,008
SIMMS:
And none of the blood on those
knives came back to the victim.

00:22:51,074 --> 00:22:52,609
But I did get two CODIS hits

00:22:52,676 --> 00:22:54,111
from the knives that
Hodges collected.

00:22:54,177 --> 00:22:56,780
These guys were both members

00:22:56,847 --> 00:22:58,815
of the Righteous Dogs,
and their body parts

00:22:58,882 --> 00:23:00,517
were found
scattered across

00:23:00,584 --> 00:23:01,652
two miles of the Mojave.

00:23:01,718 --> 00:23:03,954
Probably carved them up
in the kitchen.

00:23:04,021 --> 00:23:05,956
The Blasters
and the Dogs are rival gangs.

00:23:06,023 --> 00:23:07,991
There's been a war
over drug turf escalating

00:23:08,058 --> 00:23:09,993
over the last year.

00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:12,129
We still only have one

00:23:12,195 --> 00:23:13,297
of the knives

00:23:13,363 --> 00:23:14,298
used to kill Nettles.

00:23:14,364 --> 00:23:15,432
There had to be others.

00:23:15,499 --> 00:23:17,100
All right, the police arrived

00:23:17,167 --> 00:23:20,570
one minute, just one minute,
after the 911 call.

00:23:20,637 --> 00:23:23,273
Those other knives
couldn't have gone very far.

00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,175
No. I appreciate that, Conrad,
I do,

00:23:25,242 --> 00:23:27,711
but there's no need
for me to recuse myself, really.

00:23:27,778 --> 00:23:29,246
No.

00:23:29,313 --> 00:23:31,915
If the situation changes, yeah,
I'll, uh, I'll let you know.

00:23:31,982 --> 00:23:33,216
Okay?

00:23:33,283 --> 00:23:34,418
(tapping on window)

00:23:34,484 --> 00:23:36,486
I got to go. Thank you.

00:23:41,959 --> 00:23:44,127
Rita.
Hi.

00:23:44,194 --> 00:23:46,129
Hi.

00:23:46,196 --> 00:23:47,364
Can I come in?

00:23:47,431 --> 00:23:49,466
Oh, sure, sure.
I hope
this is okay.

00:23:49,533 --> 00:23:50,901
No. It's fine.

00:23:50,968 --> 00:23:53,036
Uh, they asked me to come down
about some paperwork.
Sure.

00:23:53,103 --> 00:23:54,571
Come on in.
I hope
this is okay.

00:23:54,638 --> 00:23:56,640
Come in.
Please, come in.

00:23:56,707 --> 00:23:57,874
Sit down.

00:23:57,941 --> 00:23:59,242
Sit down.
Please, sit down.

(clears throat)

00:24:00,577 --> 00:24:02,012
(sniffles)
Can I get you anything?

00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:03,547
Do you want anything at all?

00:24:03,614 --> 00:24:06,083
Oh. A shoulder?

00:24:06,149 --> 00:24:07,517
Oh, Rita.
No. I know. I know.

00:24:07,584 --> 00:24:09,720
This isn't the place
for that. I'm sorry. I just...

00:24:09,786 --> 00:24:11,855
That's not it. That's
not it. That's not it.

00:24:11,922 --> 00:24:15,559
Why didn't you ever tell me
that you were a cop?

00:24:15,626 --> 00:24:17,628
What? I didn't?
I-I thought...

00:24:19,162 --> 00:24:20,931
No, I guess not. I...

00:24:20,998 --> 00:24:23,934
I told you that I was married.

00:24:24,001 --> 00:24:25,535
Uh, kind of.

00:24:25,602 --> 00:24:27,471
Let's not, um...

00:24:27,537 --> 00:24:29,573
We don't really have
to talk about that now.

00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,807
That's not important, all right?

00:24:30,874 --> 00:24:31,908
Look...
We've been over that.

00:24:31,975 --> 00:24:34,444
No, I want...
I want to ex...

00:24:34,511 --> 00:24:35,812
explain to you. I...

00:24:35,879 --> 00:24:37,381
You don't have to
explain anything to me.

00:24:37,447 --> 00:24:39,883
I was calling
his captain every day

00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:42,052
because weeks are going by,

00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:44,588
and I'm not hearing from Jack.

00:24:44,655 --> 00:24:47,691
I woke up once
in the middle of the night.

00:24:47,758 --> 00:24:49,026
He had snuck in,

00:24:49,092 --> 00:24:51,695
and he was stealing some money
out of my purse.

00:24:53,697 --> 00:24:55,198
He was on drugs or something.

00:24:55,265 --> 00:24:57,200
I don't know.

00:24:57,267 --> 00:25:00,270
He started hitting me.

00:25:00,337 --> 00:25:04,942
And I was... I was pulling
on his shirt, trying to get him

00:25:05,008 --> 00:25:07,010
to stop it, and I...

00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,181
I see the name Tonya...
Yeah.

00:25:11,248 --> 00:25:13,450
...tattooed on his chest, and...

00:25:13,517 --> 00:25:15,686
How could he ever
be my husband again

00:25:15,752 --> 00:25:18,355
after he'd had
another woman's name burned

00:25:18,422 --> 00:25:19,957
into his skin like that? I...

00:25:20,023 --> 00:25:21,158
Rita...

00:25:21,224 --> 00:25:23,360
I didn't tell you the truth...

00:25:25,362 --> 00:25:27,531
...because I was afraid.

00:25:27,597 --> 00:25:29,333
I'm sorry.

00:25:29,399 --> 00:25:31,969
Because I, uh...
I handled it badly.

00:25:32,035 --> 00:25:33,804
I was not very
graceful about...
(knocking)

00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:35,072
(clears throat)

00:25:35,138 --> 00:25:37,040
Jim? I'm sorry.
Excuse me.

00:25:37,107 --> 00:25:38,976
Yeah. No.
What? What's up?

00:25:39,042 --> 00:25:41,511
Said you wanted to know
when Tonya Charles is released.

00:25:41,578 --> 00:25:42,980
Right.

00:25:58,996 --> 00:26:00,931
Rita?

00:26:00,998 --> 00:26:02,265
Yeah?

00:26:02,332 --> 00:26:03,967
We are doing

00:26:04,034 --> 00:26:07,037
everything we can to find
the killer of your husband.

00:26:17,414 --> 00:26:19,449

(brakes squeak)

00:26:30,861 --> 00:26:32,742
You lost?

00:26:33,265 --> 00:26:34,933
I don't think so.
(chuckles)

00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,067
Where's your car?

00:26:36,134 --> 00:26:38,169
I'm working a theory.

00:26:38,236 --> 00:26:40,205
Now, there are multiple
murder weapons.

00:26:40,272 --> 00:26:41,473
We only have one.

00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,708
I checked the perimeter
again. They're not here.

00:26:43,775 --> 00:26:46,244
All right, first responding said

00:26:46,311 --> 00:26:48,313
that a couple of bikers got away

00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,981
just as they showed up.

00:26:50,048 --> 00:26:52,417
Okay. Yeah, maybe they took
the knives with them.

00:26:52,484 --> 00:26:54,819
All right, I'm one of them.
I know the police are rolling.

00:26:54,886 --> 00:26:56,788
I don't want to get picked up
carrying the weapon,

00:26:56,855 --> 00:26:58,857
so I'm going to ditch them
as quickly as possible, right?

00:26:58,924 --> 00:27:00,392
Right. But you know,

00:27:00,458 --> 00:27:02,494
you can use your
department vehicle to look

00:27:02,561 --> 00:27:03,662
for that stuff.

00:27:03,728 --> 00:27:05,730
You want to catch a rat,
you move like a rat.

00:27:05,797 --> 00:27:07,432
Okay. Yeah.

00:27:07,499 --> 00:27:09,868
Yeah, responding units came in
from the east and the west.

00:27:09,935 --> 00:27:11,870
All right, south of here
is residential.

00:27:11,937 --> 00:27:13,905
Too many eyes, too many ears.

00:27:13,972 --> 00:27:15,941
I'll start looking north.

00:27:16,007 --> 00:27:18,243
Good luck.

You paged me?

00:30:32,771 --> 00:30:36,741
Yeah. I got the call records
from that phone at the bar.

00:30:36,808 --> 00:30:39,911
There was an incoming call
at 10:02 p.m.

00:30:39,978 --> 00:30:41,346
Okay, well,
that's consistent

00:30:41,413 --> 00:30:43,381

Looks like it was
from a pay phone.

00:30:51,823 --> 00:30:54,526
The call to the bar came
from <i>our</i> police department?

00:31:01,466 --> 00:31:03,401
Was Nettles dimed out
by another cop?

00:31:03,468 --> 00:31:04,803

00:31:08,273 --> 00:31:10,942
you got a potential conflict
of interest in this case.

00:31:11,009 --> 00:31:13,011
No, I don't.

00:31:15,013 --> 00:31:16,214
Okay, what do you got?

00:31:16,281 --> 00:31:17,716
Have a clean shot
of the caller.

00:31:17,782 --> 00:31:19,517
All right,
let's run it.

00:31:25,257 --> 00:31:27,659
That's Rita.

00:31:29,694 --> 00:31:32,364
I'd say you got
a conflict now.

00:31:34,232 --> 00:31:35,700
I don't know
why I'm here.

00:31:35,767 --> 00:31:36,968

00:31:39,504 --> 00:31:41,106
How did you get that number?

00:31:41,172 --> 00:31:43,808
Jack gave it to me.

In case of emergencies,

00:31:45,577 --> 00:31:48,246
I'm supposed to call
and ask for Joey Niagra,

00:31:48,313 --> 00:31:50,015
and say that I'm his mother.

00:31:50,081 --> 00:31:51,783
So, that's what you're doing
in the photo?
Yes.

00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:53,151
Why did you use the phone here?

00:31:53,218 --> 00:31:54,853
So that we'd think
a cop made the call?

00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,021
No.
What did you say?

00:31:56,087 --> 00:31:58,924
I-I asked for Jack.

00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:01,226
I... For Joey.
I-I... I just...

00:32:01,293 --> 00:32:02,727
I just wanted to hear his voice.

ECKLIE:
No. No.

00:32:04,095 --> 00:32:05,797
You told them he was a cop.
Isn't that right?

00:32:05,864 --> 00:32:07,365
No!
You admitted

00:32:07,432 --> 00:32:08,667
you'd already lost him,

00:32:08,733 --> 00:32:10,335
but if you got a divorce,
you'd end up with, what?

00:32:10,402 --> 00:32:12,170
A pile of debt, and a house
worth less than the mortgage.

00:32:12,237 --> 00:32:13,405
Right?
What are you doing?

00:32:13,471 --> 00:32:14,573
With one phone call,

00:32:14,639 --> 00:32:16,308
you got his death benefit
and his pension.

00:32:16,374 --> 00:32:18,743
That's not true!

A cocaine shipment's
in from Mexico.

Where?
She doesn't know.

them to drop it off.

00:33:21,339 --> 00:33:22,340
(ignition turns)

00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:37,022
This is Charlie-05-Stokes.

00:33:37,088 --> 00:33:38,957
I'm on Rancho Destino
south of Barston.

00:33:39,024 --> 00:33:40,859
One of our U.C. vehicles
just exploded

00:33:40,926 --> 00:33:42,627
with a U.C. officer
inside the vehicle.

00:33:42,694 --> 00:33:44,162
Send Fire and paramedics.

00:33:44,229 --> 00:33:47,632
I repeat: U.C. officer
was inside the vehicle.

00:34:04,259 --> 00:34:06,127
Looks like the
incendiary device

00:34:06,194 --> 00:34:08,396
detonated fast and big.

00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:11,700
Red paper, wax-coated.

00:34:11,766 --> 00:34:13,668
This is dynamite.

00:34:13,735 --> 00:34:15,937
They must've known
Tonya was undercover.

00:34:16,004 --> 00:34:17,172
And from the
moment the cops

00:34:17,238 --> 00:34:18,974
responded to the 911 call,

00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,242
we had this lot and the street
under control.

00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:23,478
This bomb's too
sophisticated.

00:34:23,545 --> 00:34:25,981
Must've been planted
before Nettles was killed.

00:34:26,047 --> 00:34:28,049
Whether or not they
knew Nettles was a cop,

00:34:28,116 --> 00:34:30,085
they were on to Tonya.

00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:34,022
And the order had to have come
from the head guy, Scratch.

00:34:34,089 --> 00:34:36,658
Makes sense. That's
the guy she was after.

00:34:36,725 --> 00:34:39,060
I'll head back with the body.

00:34:42,897 --> 00:34:45,367
WILLOWS:
<i>According to the blood</i>
<i>evidence, the fight started</i>

00:34:45,433 --> 00:34:47,902
here at the bar
and moved forward.

00:34:47,969 --> 00:34:49,404
Probably the first injury

00:34:49,471 --> 00:34:52,507
came from the tire chain
to Nettles' left knee.

00:34:52,574 --> 00:34:54,409
I'm Nettles.

00:34:54,476 --> 00:34:56,344
I see what's going down

00:34:56,411 --> 00:34:58,346
and I make a run

00:34:58,413 --> 00:34:59,848
to go out the back.

00:34:59,914 --> 00:35:01,049
I'm Smitty.

00:35:01,116 --> 00:35:03,885
My prints were on the chain

00:35:03,952 --> 00:35:06,121
that was collected here.

00:35:07,922 --> 00:35:10,125
I hit his left knee.

00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:12,727
Nettles was facing
in this direction.

00:35:12,794 --> 00:35:15,797
(rock music blasting)

00:35:17,399 --> 00:35:18,667
(yells)

00:35:23,571 --> 00:35:25,173
WILLOWS:
So, now, you're down.

00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,408
But you still
have a weapon:

00:35:26,474 --> 00:35:28,209
your knife.

00:35:28,276 --> 00:35:30,011
I think he was reaching for it

00:35:30,078 --> 00:35:33,315
when Jackass got in
on the fight.

00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:35,050
Hodges, you're Jackass.

00:35:35,116 --> 00:35:36,952
And don't I know it.

00:35:37,018 --> 00:35:39,721
All right, your
knife matches cuts on

00:35:39,788 --> 00:35:40,922
Nettles' right arm.

00:35:40,989 --> 00:35:43,992
Okay, so, I'm over him.

00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:45,894
(yells)

00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:50,732
All right, that cast-off

00:35:50,799 --> 00:35:54,035
over there could have been
from the repeated stabbing

00:35:54,102 --> 00:35:56,404
of an area that bleeds heavily,

00:35:56,471 --> 00:36:01,242
such as the two clavicle wounds
that match Hooper's knife.

00:36:01,309 --> 00:36:03,812
All right, in order for Hooper

00:36:03,878 --> 00:36:05,880
to reach the clavicle,

00:36:05,947 --> 00:36:08,450
I'll have to get down
on my right knee...

00:36:09,484 --> 00:36:10,619
(groans)

00:36:11,953 --> 00:36:13,288
(grunts)

00:36:13,355 --> 00:36:17,025
And at this point, his right
arm is pretty much useless.

00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:21,796
So, he pulls himself
with his left hand.

00:36:21,863 --> 00:36:24,065
But they didn't stop.

00:36:24,132 --> 00:36:25,333
Judge Death here...

00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,336
stabbed him in the kidneys.

00:36:28,403 --> 00:36:30,038
(grunting)

00:36:34,643 --> 00:36:36,011
(pained yell)

00:36:36,077 --> 00:36:39,180
And then he somehow managed
to try to get to the front door.

00:36:39,247 --> 00:36:40,548
And they let him

00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:42,684
because they knew
he wasn't going to get very far.

00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:47,155
(groaning)

00:36:47,222 --> 00:36:50,425
And then they use
Nettles' own knife on him.

00:36:50,492 --> 00:36:53,428
But I think it was
the stab to his temple

00:36:53,495 --> 00:36:55,697
that finally stopped him.

00:36:56,731 --> 00:36:59,267
(sharp inhale)

00:36:59,334 --> 00:37:01,336
(short exhale)

00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:06,308
LANGDON: And that's how
we found him, and that

00:37:06,374 --> 00:37:09,377
proves a bar fight,
but not a setup.

00:37:09,444 --> 00:37:11,446
You're right.

00:37:11,513 --> 00:37:16,184
We know that Rita Nettles
called here at 10:02 p.m.,

00:37:16,251 --> 00:37:18,386
and the fight started
right after that.

00:37:18,453 --> 00:37:21,289
LANGSTON: It's unlikely
that they would kill
a member of their

00:37:21,356 --> 00:37:25,660
own gang or a cop without
direct orders from Scratch.

00:37:25,727 --> 00:37:27,562
So, either Scratch was here,

00:37:27,629 --> 00:37:30,532
or whoever took the call
contacted Scratch.

00:37:30,598 --> 00:37:32,667
But there weren't any
outgoing calls after 10:00

00:37:32,734 --> 00:37:35,370
on any of the bikers' cell
phones or the bar phone.

00:37:35,437 --> 00:37:36,905
Wait a second.

00:37:50,552 --> 00:37:52,153
There's a bug in here.

00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:55,390
There was nothing in Nettles'
case notes that mentioned one.

00:37:55,457 --> 00:37:58,093
Nettles' iPod had
a radio receiver.

00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:01,229
If he was able to
install a transmitter...

00:38:01,296 --> 00:38:03,164
RITA:
Let me talk to Joey!

00:38:03,231 --> 00:38:04,399
BARTENDER:
He's with his old lady.

00:38:04,466 --> 00:38:06,601
RITA:
Tonya, is that her name?

00:38:06,668 --> 00:38:08,870
Huh? How young is she? Hmm?

00:38:08,937 --> 00:38:10,739
She's real young?

00:38:10,805 --> 00:38:13,541
He's a cop! You know that?

00:38:13,608 --> 00:38:14,876
A cop!

00:38:14,943 --> 00:38:16,111
His name is not Joey!

00:38:16,177 --> 00:38:18,013
BARTENDER:
Hey, who is this?

00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:19,247
RITA:
I'm his wife!

00:38:19,314 --> 00:38:21,082
Okay, all right, all right.

00:38:21,149 --> 00:38:22,250
Jim...

00:38:22,317 --> 00:38:24,452
Vice sent over
another surveillance

00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:27,122
wiretap where a man identified
as Scratch was recorded.

00:38:27,188 --> 00:38:29,024
JOHNSON:
I was able to

00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:30,925
grab enough to make
a comparison.

00:38:35,497 --> 00:38:38,300
BARTENDER:
Hey, who is this?

00:38:38,366 --> 00:38:39,434
SCRATCH:
Yo, what is this?

00:38:42,804 --> 00:38:44,906
Hey, who is this?
Yo, what is this?

00:38:44,973 --> 00:38:47,409
So, Scratch is the bartender.

00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,581
Nice chopper.

00:38:53,648 --> 00:38:57,852
If this paint is scratched,
you got a problem.

00:39:03,959 --> 00:39:07,128
(engines revving)

00:39:36,725 --> 00:39:39,060
They all just left.

00:39:54,042 --> 00:39:58,713
(beeping)

00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:00,048
JOHNSON:
I've got them.

00:40:00,115 --> 00:40:02,317
They're moving east
on Sunset Road.

00:40:03,351 --> 00:40:07,188
Just turned south
onto Hasbrook.

00:40:07,255 --> 00:40:09,391
They're stopping behind
an industrial building.

00:40:09,457 --> 00:40:11,826
Number 2106.

00:40:27,909 --> 00:40:28,910
It's Kenny.

00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:42,691
(guns cocking)

00:40:45,427 --> 00:40:48,263
(chuckling):
Sorry, Scratch.

00:40:51,466 --> 00:40:53,134
Dogs found it first.

00:40:54,402 --> 00:40:56,705
(sirens blaring)

00:40:59,808 --> 00:41:01,776
Las Vegas Police!

00:41:04,279 --> 00:41:06,381
OFFICER:
Put your hands above your head!

00:41:06,448 --> 00:41:08,550
Las Vegas Police!

00:41:08,617 --> 00:41:11,186
Put your hands up!

00:41:17,959 --> 00:41:20,929
Put your hands
where I can see 'em!

00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:23,398
(engine revving)

00:41:23,465 --> 00:41:24,499
(tires squeal)

00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:30,305
Stop!

00:41:33,141 --> 00:41:34,876
(gunshots)

00:41:40,015 --> 00:41:41,283
MAN:
Not moving!
I'm not moving!

00:41:41,349 --> 00:41:43,418
Hey, don't hate me, man.

00:41:43,485 --> 00:41:45,553
(chuckling)

00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:47,722
That bitch cop
was easy to make.

00:41:47,789 --> 00:41:50,125
And your boy Joey should've
took care of his wife.

00:41:50,191 --> 00:41:52,694
Shut up.

00:42:25,593 --> 00:42:29,631
I know this is your favorite way
of wrapping up a tough case.

00:42:29,698 --> 00:42:33,535
Little scotch... little talk.

00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:38,340
You feel like talking?

00:42:47,048 --> 00:42:49,050
All right, then.
