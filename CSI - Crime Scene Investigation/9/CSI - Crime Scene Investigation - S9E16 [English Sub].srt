00:00:06,373 --> 00:00:09,543
(indistinct whispers)

00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:12,145
Happy Birthday, Nicky.
Happy Birthday, Nick.

00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:14,181
Oh!
Your favorite.

00:00:14,248 --> 00:00:16,550
Oh, wow, thanks.

00:00:16,617 --> 00:00:18,185
There you are.
Didn't know if you were

00:00:18,252 --> 00:00:19,520
a stripe or solid man.

00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:20,888
I told him to let it ride
on paisley.

00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:23,924
You can wear it
to your next arson scene.

00:00:23,991 --> 00:00:25,125
Fair enough, thanks.

00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:26,660
(phone rings)

00:00:26,727 --> 00:00:28,462
This is Catherine.
ADAMS:
Hey, you know,

00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:30,130
Pancake Hutch has a free
breakfast on your birthday.

00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:31,298
My treat.

00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:32,833
Uh, not tonight.
Maybe another time.

00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,435
They know you're lying
when you try it any other night.

00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:36,436
(chuckles)

00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:37,571
Guilty.

00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:39,740
You've done it, too.
WILLOWS:
Okay.

00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:40,774
Got it.

00:00:40,841 --> 00:00:43,977
Uh, got a 419, East Fremont.

00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,045
A place called

00:00:45,112 --> 00:00:46,813
Park Pines Motel.

00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,115
I'll take it.

00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,218
WILLOWS:
But...

00:00:51,285 --> 00:00:53,487
Uh, what about your cake?

00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:54,788
Um...

00:00:54,855 --> 00:00:56,323
Save me a piece.

00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,591
Thanks.

00:00:57,658 --> 00:01:00,194
(siren wails)

00:01:07,334 --> 00:01:09,436
(indistinct chattering)

00:01:13,941 --> 00:01:16,109
So the victim is a 16-year-old
girl who lives on the premises.

00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:18,111
She's the daughter of
Mark and Nicole Jones,

00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:22,249
who run the motel.
You remember them?

00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:24,751
So...

00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:27,421
NICOLE:
All I can tell
you is that...

00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:29,223
that our daughter
was there...

00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:33,493
I knew her.

00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,729
Yeah, well,
I'm going to, uh...

00:01:35,796 --> 00:01:37,297
I'm going to go
knock on some doors.

00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:42,936
GIRL:
<i>So, what happened?</i>

00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:50,244
(birds chirping)

00:01:52,513 --> 00:01:54,548
(insects chirping)

00:01:58,151 --> 00:02:00,087
(indistinct chattering)

00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,024
What's your name?


00:02:04,091 --> 00:02:06,293
Haley.

00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,195
What's yours?
Nick.

00:02:08,262 --> 00:02:10,197
"Nick."

00:02:10,264 --> 00:02:12,599
So, what happened?

00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:14,268
Well, Haley,

00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:16,336
that's what I have
to figure out.

Whoo!


00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,382
How far into decomp is he?


00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:03,750
He isn't.


00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:05,118
Look, it's
a fresh wound


00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,753
to the back of the head.


00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:07,754
The body's still warm.


00:03:07,821 --> 00:03:09,289
It's the immaculate
decomposition.


00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,058
VARTANN:
The manager heard a gunshot.


00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:13,093
Called it in.
Vic's ID says


00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,862
"Harry Steadwell."


00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:17,331
STOKES: One round fired
from Dirty Harry's revolver.


00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:18,999
(chamber clicks)
Well, he wasn't shot.


00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:20,501
(groans)


00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:22,002
(coughs)


00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:23,737
Ooh...


00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:25,405
Is he the registered guest?


00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:27,074
I found a room key
in his pocket,


00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:30,577
but no luggage
or belongings in the room.


00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:32,412
But he brought his own
garage door opener?


00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:34,281
Is this his?
Yeah.


00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:36,450
All right, I'll go
talk to the manager.


00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:38,418
I don't mind stepping out.


00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:43,390
Looks like the dresser


00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:45,759
gave him the hair cut.


00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:49,696
You know, if he fell back
from sitting in the chair,


00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:51,365
he wouldn't have had enough
momentum to whack


00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:52,466
his head this hard.


00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:53,600
Unless he was...


00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:57,704
...standing on it.


00:03:57,771 --> 00:03:59,606
That could be a bullet hole.


00:04:00,474 --> 00:04:01,475
(gunshot)
(groans)


00:04:08,015 --> 00:04:09,483
Hey, Dave?


00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,752
You might want to...
Oh!


00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:13,353
Oh-ho.
God!


00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,521
Oh...


00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,056
No. No, that didn't happen.


00:04:16,123 --> 00:04:18,358
Sorry, brother.
Oh, my God!


00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:19,893
Ah! Whoa!
Eww.


00:04:23,297 --> 00:04:25,165
(indistinct radio transmission)


00:04:25,232 --> 00:04:26,166
MAN:
Hey, friend?


00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:28,001
Got five bucks for
a cup of coffee?


00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:29,469
Five bucks?
Venti half-caf latte,


00:04:29,536 --> 00:04:30,704
couple biscotti.


00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:31,772
You know, it's a fair price.


00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:33,607
Oh, sorry, bud.


00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:34,775
You'll be back.


00:04:34,842 --> 00:04:36,109
Cops are always here.


00:04:36,176 --> 00:04:37,878
Every nigh, manager would
be banging on that door.

00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:38,979
"Cops are here!
Cops are here!"


00:04:39,046 --> 00:04:39,980
Last manager took off


00:04:40,047 --> 00:04:41,215
a week ago without notice.


00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,382
The new guy started today,


00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:44,017
so the office
is a mess.


00:04:44,084 --> 00:04:45,419
(door opens)
Here he is.


00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:46,553
Here you go.


00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,788
VARTANN:
What do you got for me?


00:04:47,855 --> 00:04:49,223
"Harry Steadwell."


00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,292
Checked into room seven last
Thursday; paid for one night.


00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:53,827
There's no record of him
checking out.


00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:55,495
All right, I need to get
into the crawl space


00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:56,563
above room seven.


00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,664
Does every room have


00:04:57,731 --> 00:04:59,833
an access panel?
Beats me. I just got here.


00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,602
Look, uh,
you're welcome to check.


00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:03,003
(clears throat)


00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,338
Thank you.


00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:06,106
VARTANN: Thanks.
Sure.


00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:08,008
Let me know what
I can do.
Okay.


00:05:22,256 --> 00:05:24,258
(cell phone chimes)


00:05:26,093 --> 00:05:28,095
(siren wailing)


00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,364
GRISSOM (on message):
I just spent two hours


00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,600
testifying about decapitation
by blown tire


00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,035
and I realized something.


00:05:35,102 --> 00:05:36,270
Happy Birthday, pal.


00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,338
(laughs)


00:05:40,107 --> 00:05:41,942
HALEY:
You figure it out yet?


00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:44,178
No.


00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:45,812
No, not yet, Haley.


00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:47,214
You can tell me.


00:05:47,281 --> 00:05:48,982
I'm not scared of that stuff.


00:05:49,049 --> 00:05:50,150
I can see that.


00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:51,685
NICOLE: Haley, leave
the man alone!


00:05:51,752 --> 00:05:54,221
If it were up to her,


00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:55,989
I'd be locked in my room
all day.


00:05:56,056 --> 00:05:57,958
But I told her,
forensics is just science,


00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:59,526
you know?


00:05:59,593 --> 00:06:01,562
It's what you go
to school for and...


00:06:01,628 --> 00:06:04,998
But you don't look like
my Chem teacher.


00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:07,000
Thanks.


00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:08,235
I think.


00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:18,045
You, uh, do know the crime
scene's in the next room?


00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,479
I always look
for the yellow tape.


00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,548
There's something
dead up there, Greg.


00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:23,183
And it's big, heavy
and smells awful.


00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,552
One of us has got
to go up there and get it.
You know what?


00:06:25,619 --> 00:06:27,120
It's your birthday.


00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:29,690
(Sanders grunts)


00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:33,861
I'm keeping that gift card.


00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:35,829
What?


00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,798
Whoo!

00:06:37,865 --> 00:06:39,833
(coughing)

00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,902
I think I found
your Big Drip.

00:06:43,604 --> 00:06:45,839
Looks like he,
uh, crawled in

00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:47,641
the same way I did.

00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:49,776
Always die downstairs.

00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:51,211
(moans)

00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:57,684
(coughing)

00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,353
STOKES:
"Dale Durney."

00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,622
Same address as the motel.

00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:04,758
I think we just found
that missing manager.

00:07:04,825 --> 00:07:07,661
Whoa!

00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:09,363
That is a lot of green.

00:07:11,365 --> 00:07:12,900
And a little grey.

00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:14,668
It's got to be insulation.

00:07:14,735 --> 00:07:16,336
Found the same stuff
in the crawl space.

00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:18,772
In a No-Tell like
Park Pines,

00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:21,108
ceiling's a favorite spot
to stash your goodies.

00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,848
(beeping)

00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:29,917
(whirring)

00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,158
Hey.

00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:40,260
Hey, the, uh,
prints on the remote

00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:42,462
were all Dale Durney,
the dead manager.
Mm-hmm.

00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:44,965
FYI, the batteries are dead.

00:07:45,032 --> 00:07:47,034
And the prints
on the money's rubber band

00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,736
are Dale Durney
and Harry Steadwell.

00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,305
Well, we know Dale pocketed it.

00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:53,006
Harry probably stashed it.

00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:54,408
Why would he
leave it there

00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,576
for a week?

00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:58,579
Oh. It wasn't by choice.

00:07:58,645 --> 00:07:59,713
Harry got arrested

00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,381
the same day he checked
into the motel

00:08:01,448 --> 00:08:03,617
for violating an ex's
restraining order.

00:08:03,684 --> 00:08:05,052
Got released from County

00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:07,187
this morning.
So he goes back to the motel.

00:08:07,254 --> 00:08:09,156
Yeah, to retrieve
his money.

00:08:09,223 --> 00:08:10,791
And then... what?

00:08:10,858 --> 00:08:13,160
He shoots the man
who swiped his cash?

00:08:13,227 --> 00:08:15,863
Even though the dude's
been dead for...?

00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:17,531
ROBBINS:
About a week.

00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:21,268
Judging by the presence of first
and second instar maggots.

00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:23,604
Decomp appears to have
been accelerated by

00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,974
extreme heat and the lack
of airflow in the crawl space.

00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,577
Recovered a bullet
from the right iliopsoas muscle.

00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:33,247
No evidence of hemorrhage
in the abdominal cavity.

00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:35,616
No bleeding in the muscle
or intestinal walls.

00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:38,752
So wound occurred
after he was dead.

00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:41,054
What about COD?

00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:42,589
Well, it turns
out his fortune

00:08:42,656 --> 00:08:44,725
can be read from his palms.

00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,426
Silvery wounds.

00:08:46,493 --> 00:08:49,096
I excised samples
of flesh for histology.

00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:51,331
Under magnification,
the samples showed

00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:52,966
streaming of nuclei

00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,868
consistent
with electrical burns.

00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:57,304
COD is cardiac arrest.

00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:59,106
Electrocution.

00:08:59,173 --> 00:09:00,507
He was in the
crawl space,

00:09:00,574 --> 00:09:01,875
so maybe he came
in contact

00:09:01,942 --> 00:09:03,777
with exposed wiring.

00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:17,658
I found the receiver to that

00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,026
remote control.

00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:20,360
Can you tell what it's for?

00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:25,532
Yeah, it's wired
to the access panel above you.

00:09:32,306 --> 00:09:33,607
I killed the circuit.

00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:40,214
Hey, there's a layer of metal
sandwiched in the middle here.

00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:45,085
It's like my eighth grade
science fair project.

00:09:45,152 --> 00:09:46,620
A homemade electromagnet.

00:09:46,687 --> 00:09:48,722
Wire wraps
around an iron rod.

00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:50,958
Current runs through it,
creating a magnetic field.

00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:53,427
Genius.
Guy who lives here

00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:55,863
said that the manager, Dale,

00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,198
was beating on room seven's
door every night,

00:09:58,265 --> 00:09:59,533
saying the cops
were coming.

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,901
Don't remember many call outs.

00:10:00,968 --> 00:10:01,935
Me, either.

00:10:02,002 --> 00:10:04,238
I think it was a setup.

00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:07,307
<i>A week ago, Harry Steadwell</i>
<i>checks into room seven</i>

00:10:07,374 --> 00:10:09,042
<i>with $10K, dirty money.</i>
(tapping on window): Cops!

00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,477
Cops in the lot!
Cops!

00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:17,684
<i>What Harry doesn't know</i>
<i>is that Manager Dale's</i>

00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:20,821
<i>got a plan to profit</i>
<i>off guys like Harry.</i>

00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:27,694
<i>He turns on his</i>
<i>electromagnetic lock.</i>

00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:29,429
<i>Harry can't get his money.</i>
Oh, come on!

00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:31,131
Come on, man!
<i>Gives up and leaves.</i>

00:10:31,198 --> 00:10:35,536
<i>So, Dale goes to see what</i>
<i>goodies had Harry all fired up.</i>

00:10:35,602 --> 00:10:37,204
<i>But he can't</i>
<i>get the panel open.</i>

00:10:37,271 --> 00:10:39,706
<i>The batteries</i>
<i>in his remote are dead.</i>

00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:43,510
SANDERS:
<i>So he hustles up and over</i>
<i>to reap his harvest,</i>

00:10:43,577 --> 00:10:46,013
<i>notices the panel's a little</i>
<i>off, thinks it's a casualty</i>

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,481
<i>of Harry's pounding.</i>

00:10:47,548 --> 00:10:48,749
<i>The real casualty</i>

00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:51,218
<i>is the frayed wire</i>
<i>inside the panel.</i>

00:10:51,285 --> 00:10:52,953
<i>And the crawl space is hot.</i>
(electricity crackling)

00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,188
<i>Dale's got sweaty palms,</i>

00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:56,456
<i>and sweat is a great</i>
<i>electrolyte.</i>

00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:58,892
A week later, Harry gets
sprung from the clink,

00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,227
comes back
to get his money.

00:11:00,294 --> 00:11:02,229
But why did he shoot
the dead guy?

00:11:02,296 --> 00:11:05,532
I don't think he knew
Dale was up there, man.

00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,201
The panel was
still magnetized.

00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:10,571
<i>Maybe he was using his gun</i>
<i>to bang it open.</i>

00:11:10,637 --> 00:11:13,006
<i>It got magnetized,</i>
<i>and shot by accident.</i>

00:11:13,073 --> 00:11:15,142
(gunshot)
(groans)

00:11:20,747 --> 00:11:23,283
Mr. Jones.

00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,052
Oh, hey.

00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:27,287
Got a few numbers of the
crime scene cleanup people.

00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:29,256
Decomp can be
a little bit

00:11:29,323 --> 00:11:31,325
harder to get out
of the carpet than you think.

00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:33,026
Thanks.
(girls laughing)

00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:36,263
Boy, she makes
friends fast.

00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:37,764
Nah, Bree and
her have been

00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:39,399
friends for a while.

00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:40,834
She didn't have to switch
schools when we moved.

00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:41,902
Well, that's good.

00:11:41,969 --> 00:11:43,837
Take care now.
Yeah.

00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:45,105
Hey, thanks for
those numbers.

00:11:45,172 --> 00:11:46,306
Yeah, you got it, man.

00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:50,644
(rattling)

00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:53,113
Hey, buddy--

00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,615
you still want
that cup of coffee?

00:11:54,681 --> 00:11:56,850
Hell, yeah.

00:11:56,917 --> 00:11:58,118
There you go.

00:11:58,185 --> 00:11:59,920
Happy Birthday.

00:11:59,987 --> 00:12:01,355
It's not my birthday.

00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:02,990
Thanks, man.

00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:08,362
(girls laughing)

00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:20,807
(siren wails)

00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:22,876
(indistinct radio transmission)

00:12:44,498 --> 00:12:45,966
BREE:
I don't know
what they did to me.

00:12:46,033 --> 00:12:47,134
BRASS:
"They"?

00:12:47,201 --> 00:12:49,803
That whole family--
they're weird.

00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,572
Like obsessed.

00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:53,340
Aren't you friends with Haley?

00:12:53,407 --> 00:12:54,608
Was.

00:12:54,675 --> 00:12:56,109
I-I guess.

00:12:56,176 --> 00:12:57,778
But then she and
her mom started

00:12:57,845 --> 00:12:59,313
giving me the creeps.

00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:01,582
Mrs. Jones would
just stare at me.

00:13:01,648 --> 00:13:04,117
And when Haley showed up
in homeroom with her hair

00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:06,086
exactly like me
a few weeks ago,

00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:08,088
that was it,
I was done.

00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:09,890
BRASS:
So, Bree, what happened?

00:13:09,957 --> 00:13:12,459
I turned 16 tonight.

00:13:12,526 --> 00:13:15,629
Everyone threw this bonfire
for me.

00:13:15,696 --> 00:13:17,831
<i>It was tons of fun.</i>

00:13:17,898 --> 00:13:20,100
<i>And then the world</i>
<i>went all weird.</i>

00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:24,104
(voices and music distorted)

00:13:26,874 --> 00:13:30,143
<i>I don't remember anything</i>
<i>until I woke up here--</i>

00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:33,046
in Haley's living room.

00:13:33,113 --> 00:13:34,681
My pants off.

00:13:34,748 --> 00:13:37,117
Where was
Haley's father?

00:13:37,184 --> 00:13:38,652
Standing over me.

00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:43,257
(gasps)

00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:44,358
Get off me!

00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:45,859
Get off me!

00:13:45,926 --> 00:13:46,860
(screams)

00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:50,964
NICOLE:
We were here.
We were asleep.

00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:52,466
Mark heard something.

00:13:52,533 --> 00:13:54,668
Bree was in the living
room and just ran out.

00:13:54,735 --> 00:13:55,736
I have no idea

00:13:55,802 --> 00:13:58,438
what she was even doing here.

00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:01,041
Haley doesn't know either.

00:14:01,108 --> 00:14:02,876
Mr. Jones,

00:14:02,943 --> 00:14:05,679
I'm, uh, going to need
to collect your underwear.

00:14:14,555 --> 00:14:16,156
No, no.

00:14:16,223 --> 00:14:19,026
You can, uh,
leave that door open,

00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:21,395
if you don't mind.

00:14:22,763 --> 00:14:24,231
(mouthing)

00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,202
(indistinct radio transmissions)

00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:51,458
MARK:
I swear to you,
I was sleeping.

00:14:51,525 --> 00:14:54,027
I heard something.

00:14:54,094 --> 00:14:57,998
I... came here and I...

00:14:58,065 --> 00:15:00,601
saw Bree and she just...

00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:01,668
just took off.

00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:02,936
What was she doing here?

00:15:03,003 --> 00:15:04,271
She has a key.

00:15:04,338 --> 00:15:05,806
My wife gave it to her.

00:15:05,873 --> 00:15:08,509
Told her she could hang here
anytime she wants.

00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:10,544
Her parents, they...

00:15:10,611 --> 00:15:11,778
they work.

00:15:11,845 --> 00:15:14,014
They're not around
a lot, so...

00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:16,450
She's my daughter's best friend.

00:15:16,517 --> 00:15:18,318
All right.

00:15:18,385 --> 00:15:20,420
Why don't you put on
some clothes.

00:15:20,487 --> 00:15:22,189
You're going to need
to come with us--

00:15:22,256 --> 00:15:24,324
give your statement.

00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,662
(indistinct radio transmission)

00:15:38,272 --> 00:15:40,207
BRASS:
I just need a little more
information.

00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:42,309
Hey, Jim.

00:15:42,376 --> 00:15:43,610
Yeah.

00:15:43,677 --> 00:15:44,811
This SUV over here's

00:15:44,878 --> 00:15:46,346
got mud all over
the tires.

00:15:46,413 --> 00:15:49,049
You might want to
find out whose it is.
It's the Jones'.

00:15:49,116 --> 00:15:50,684
Okay, so tell me again--

00:15:50,751 --> 00:15:52,553
where were you all tonight?

00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:54,488
Uh, we were here.
We stayed in all night.

00:15:54,555 --> 00:15:56,523
So the car just drove
itself to the bonfire?

00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:58,625
Is that what happened?

00:15:58,692 --> 00:16:01,061
Huh?

00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:05,599
It was me, I went.

00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:08,068
What?!
I knew what was going to
be going on there tonight.

00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:09,736
And that's why I
didn't want you to go.

00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:12,072
So I went there and I
took some pictures,
so that you could see

00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:13,407
what I'm talking about...
Did people see you?!

00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,108
Haley, it...
Unbelievable!

00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:16,810
I hate you!
I hate you!

00:16:16,877 --> 00:16:18,445
Okay, Officer Mitchell,
Officer Mitchell,

00:16:18,512 --> 00:16:19,713
why don't you take Haley

00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:22,082
and buy her a soda
on us, okay?
You got it.

00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:24,084
Miss,
let's take a walk.

00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:25,719
BRASS:
So what, you grabbed
your camera,

00:16:25,786 --> 00:16:29,223
said you were taking pictures
for the yearbook?

00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:31,592
I'm going to need
to see that camera.

00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,927
WILLOWS:
<i>Can you tell me who's in</i>
<i>this photo from last night?</i>

00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:34,995
BREE:
<i>These guys are all</i>

00:16:35,062 --> 00:16:36,530
baseball players.

00:16:36,597 --> 00:16:39,466
Bryan Rupert and Cole Maliska
were my boyfriends.

00:16:39,533 --> 00:16:41,435
Dave Henkel is.

00:16:41,502 --> 00:16:43,170
And Trey Gallo wants to be.

00:16:43,237 --> 00:16:44,638
Though some people

00:16:44,705 --> 00:16:46,273
have been saying
he already is.

00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,742
And what about this one?

00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:49,943
BREE:
Whoa. He was there?

00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,445
No, this creep

00:16:51,512 --> 00:16:54,948
should not have been anywhere
near my party's galaxy.

00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:57,117
Zack Fenish.

00:16:57,184 --> 00:16:59,353
At school, even when I
don't see him following me,

00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:02,089
I can smell the Sharpie
on his fingernails.

00:17:02,155 --> 00:17:03,957
I reported him for stalking
last semester.

00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:06,560
There's paperwork
and everything.

00:17:06,627 --> 00:17:08,996
So if you weren't invited
to Bree's birthday party,

00:17:09,062 --> 00:17:10,464
why'd you go?

00:17:10,531 --> 00:17:11,632
I was looking
for someone.

00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:12,966
That would be Bree, right?

00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:15,002
Epic fail, sir.

00:17:15,068 --> 00:17:17,604
No, I can't stand Bree Lindale,

00:17:17,671 --> 00:17:19,840
her Neanderthal harem,

00:17:19,907 --> 00:17:22,242
or the ozone of suck
that lingers around them all.

00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:23,310
Well, according

00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:25,846
your school disciplinary report

00:17:25,913 --> 00:17:26,847
you were stalking her.

00:17:26,914 --> 00:17:29,416
I was not stalking Bree Lindale.

00:17:29,483 --> 00:17:31,518
I was stalking Haley Jones.

00:17:31,585 --> 00:17:32,686
Zack.

00:17:32,753 --> 00:17:34,087
ZACK:
Who always follows Bree around.

00:17:34,154 --> 00:17:37,224
Haley's the one that I went
to go see at the party.

00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:40,027
Zack...
Dad, she's the hottest
girl at school.

00:17:40,093 --> 00:17:41,328
'Cause I can tell

00:17:41,395 --> 00:17:43,630
there's a vicious
bad girl inside

00:17:43,697 --> 00:17:45,465
just waiting to claw
its way out.

00:17:45,532 --> 00:17:47,734
And as soon as it does,
I'm gonna be there

00:17:47,801 --> 00:17:50,003
to rope it up and take it
to homecoming.

00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,673
Anyway, she wasn't even there,
so I just left.

00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,575
Okay, that's all
he's got to say.

00:17:54,641 --> 00:17:56,944
That's it.
Come on.

00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:58,545
Sure. We're gonna need
a DNA sample.

00:17:58,612 --> 00:18:00,380
Absolutely not.
My son-client

00:18:00,447 --> 00:18:03,083
will not be offering any...
All right, all right,
look, look,

00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,685
I heard what
happened to Bree,

00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:07,554
and until Pops here gets
me my birthday Beemer,

00:18:07,621 --> 00:18:09,723
I'm rolling ten-speed.

00:18:11,325 --> 00:18:14,361
I don't think I took her
anywhere on my bike.

00:18:14,428 --> 00:18:16,163
I got your message.
What's going on?

00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,898
Well, um...

00:18:17,965 --> 00:18:20,934
You know the snapshots of the
bonfire Nicole Jones took?

00:18:21,001 --> 00:18:22,236
Yeah.

00:18:22,302 --> 00:18:25,445
Well, I checked the camera's
memory drive.

00:18:25,445 --> 00:18:26,230
Discovered some

00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,533
recently-deleted photos.

00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,468
They're all of Bree Lindale.

00:18:30,535 --> 00:18:32,370
But not one of
her own daughter.

00:18:35,273 --> 00:18:37,642
STOKES:
Why don't you tell us
about these photos

00:18:37,709 --> 00:18:39,911
from your camera?

00:18:39,978 --> 00:18:42,347
I had a daughter.

00:18:45,016 --> 00:18:47,619
You mean
another daughter?

00:18:47,685 --> 00:18:50,154
Melissa.

00:18:50,221 --> 00:18:52,624
She died when
she was an infant.

00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:54,859
It was before
Haley was born.

00:18:54,926 --> 00:18:56,761
When Haley became friends
with Bree,

00:18:56,828 --> 00:18:59,497
I couldn't help seeing that...
Bree looked

00:18:59,564 --> 00:19:01,566
just like Melissa.

00:19:01,633 --> 00:19:04,035
But I thought you just said
she died when she was a baby.

00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:06,271
I can see it
in her eyes.

00:19:06,337 --> 00:19:09,407
It's what Melissa would have
looked like if she had grown up.

00:19:09,474 --> 00:19:12,710
So that's why you went
to Bree's birthday party

00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:14,445
to take photos of her.

00:19:14,512 --> 00:19:20,218
I let myself pretend, just...

00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:22,287
for a moment
that Bree is Melissa.

00:19:22,353 --> 00:19:23,621
She isn't dead.

00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:29,560
Then why did you, uh,
delete her photos?

00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:32,263
I was worried that
Haley would find them.

00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:34,299
We've never told
Haley about Melissa.

00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:38,369
Do you have any idea
what it's like

00:19:38,436 --> 00:19:40,405
to lose a daughter?

00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:42,407
When I was driving
away from that party,

00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:44,676
Bree was drinking
with those boys.

00:19:44,742 --> 00:19:48,212
Did you-- did you even
talk to the boys?

00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:49,480
Tox from Bree Lindale.

00:19:49,547 --> 00:19:51,115
Positive for GHB
in her blood.

00:19:51,182 --> 00:19:52,383
Date rape drug.

00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:54,152
Yes, but Wendy
said to tell you

00:19:54,218 --> 00:19:56,821
the SAE came back
negative for penetration.

00:19:56,888 --> 00:19:58,590
However, there
were epithelials

00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:00,258
of an unknown male
in the region.

00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:02,293
By region, do you mean
the pubic region?

00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,028
Because the trace

00:20:04,095 --> 00:20:06,564
on Bree Lindale's
"down there place"

00:20:06,631 --> 00:20:08,032
came back as Neatsfoot oil

00:20:08,099 --> 00:20:10,535
and hydrotreated paraffinic
petroleum distillates.

00:20:10,602 --> 00:20:12,136
Neatsfoot oil?

00:20:12,203 --> 00:20:14,572
Used to use that to treat
our mitts in Pony League.

00:20:14,639 --> 00:20:16,107
Much as I'm
intrigued

00:20:16,174 --> 00:20:19,077
by this bizarre equestrian
competition of which you speak,

00:20:19,143 --> 00:20:22,447
the compound's actually
a consumer product sold

00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:24,082
to condition baseball gloves.

00:20:26,117 --> 00:20:28,152
(door opens)

00:20:28,219 --> 00:20:29,754
What's up?

00:20:29,821 --> 00:20:30,955
You need
to swab me again?

00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:32,890
(chuckles)

00:20:32,957 --> 00:20:35,393
No, no, the first swab

00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,228
gave us what we needed--

00:20:37,295 --> 00:20:39,097
a warrant to search
your vehicle

00:20:39,163 --> 00:20:40,265
while you were at
batting practice.

00:20:40,331 --> 00:20:43,167
Where we found...

00:20:44,335 --> 00:20:47,205
...your GHB.

00:20:47,272 --> 00:20:50,008
My trainer gave me that.

00:20:50,074 --> 00:20:51,909
What about Bree Lindale?

00:20:51,976 --> 00:20:53,978
What about her?
She's my girlfriend.

00:20:56,114 --> 00:20:58,950
I want you to listen to me now.

00:20:59,017 --> 00:21:01,019
I know she was with you.

00:21:01,085 --> 00:21:03,254
Now, if you want
me to match

00:21:03,321 --> 00:21:04,656
the muddy shoe impressions

00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:07,158
all over your passenger side
floor mat to her, I will.

00:21:07,225 --> 00:21:08,793
You're 18, man.

00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:11,262
You'll go to jail.
I didn't do anything.

00:21:11,329 --> 00:21:13,064
You didn't drug her?
Come on.

00:21:13,131 --> 00:21:15,900
You didn't assault her?
I didn't get the chance
to do anything.

00:21:15,967 --> 00:21:17,435
I never do with Bree.

00:21:17,502 --> 00:21:19,537
<i>She keeps saying</i>
<i>that she's saving herself.</i>

00:21:19,604 --> 00:21:21,739
<i>But half the dugout's</i>
<i>been saying</i>

00:21:21,806 --> 00:21:23,641
<i>that Trey Gallo, the pitcher,</i>
<i>he's been hittin' it.</i>

00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:25,810
<i>They even had a motel room.</i>

00:21:31,115 --> 00:21:33,351
(distorted):
Are you okay? What's wrong?

00:21:33,418 --> 00:21:35,486
Do you want
to go?

00:21:35,553 --> 00:21:39,791
<i>Figured no point in letting</i>
<i>that room go to waste.</i>

00:21:39,857 --> 00:21:41,826
<i>Especially if Trey paid for it.</i>

00:21:41,893 --> 00:21:43,528
<i>And that GHB--</i>
<i>that stuff barely worked.</i>

00:21:43,595 --> 00:21:45,229
What are you doing?

00:21:45,296 --> 00:21:46,998
What are you doing?!
Get off of me!

00:21:47,065 --> 00:21:49,434
What do you think
you're doing?!
Bree, wait.

00:21:51,035 --> 00:21:52,437
WILLOWS:
Surveillance cameras
picked you up

00:21:52,503 --> 00:21:54,572
walking down Fremont.

00:21:54,639 --> 00:21:58,009
The motel's only a
couple blocks from there.

00:21:58,076 --> 00:22:00,378
You jumped out
of Dave Henkel's truck.

00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:01,379
Then what happened?

00:22:01,446 --> 00:22:03,414
I was kinda freaked

00:22:03,481 --> 00:22:06,017
and I didn't want to deal
with getting home.

00:22:06,084 --> 00:22:07,352
So you just
crashed there?

00:22:07,418 --> 00:22:08,853
The Joneses didn't drug you

00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,022
or kidnap you?

00:22:11,089 --> 00:22:12,156
No.

00:22:12,223 --> 00:22:13,324
Then what did

00:22:13,391 --> 00:22:15,426
Mr. Jones do to you?

00:22:15,493 --> 00:22:18,496
Tell her what
he did to you, Bree.

00:22:20,598 --> 00:22:22,834
He didn't do anything.

00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,535
I just didn't
want Haley

00:22:24,602 --> 00:22:26,404
to think
we were friends again.

00:22:26,471 --> 00:22:29,007
Like I was there
for a slumber party

00:22:29,073 --> 00:22:30,308
or something.

00:22:30,375 --> 00:22:34,312
So your boyfriend drugs you,
attempts to rape you,

00:22:34,379 --> 00:22:36,714
and you're willing

00:22:36,781 --> 00:22:38,683
to let your friend's
family take the rap?

00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:42,353
Haley is not my friend.

00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,756
MAN:
<i>Hey, Crime Scene,</i>

00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:45,924
check me out.

00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:49,294
90 days clean,
just me and Lady Caffeine.

00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,362
(chuckles)
Yeah, lookin' good.

00:22:51,429 --> 00:22:52,931
Always, man.
Flossin'!

00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:54,666
(Stokes laughs)

00:22:54,732 --> 00:22:56,000
Hi, Haley.

00:22:56,067 --> 00:22:57,502
Parents around?

00:22:59,404 --> 00:23:02,240
Okay. Well, I brought back
your mom's camera,

00:23:02,307 --> 00:23:04,642
couple other things here, so...

00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:08,313
Well, sorry to, uh,

00:23:08,379 --> 00:23:12,350
sorry to interrupt you.

00:23:12,417 --> 00:23:13,851
You want to see something?

00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:27,231
And the hits just keep coming.

00:23:30,335 --> 00:23:31,970
Don't worry about that.

00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:33,104
Blow it off.

00:23:33,171 --> 00:23:34,706
You don't get it, do you?!

00:23:34,772 --> 00:23:36,541
My life is over!

00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:42,513
(door slams)

00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:45,583
(gentle melody begins playing)

00:23:53,458 --> 00:23:56,361
(thunder rumbles)

00:23:56,427 --> 00:23:59,430

ADAMS:
The manager's daughter
found the body

00:25:05,697 --> 00:25:08,666
when she came in
to clean the room.

00:25:18,732 --> 00:25:22,336
Check-in records have
her listed as Tanya Carrow,

00:25:22,402 --> 00:25:24,805
Arizona driver's
license number.

00:25:24,871 --> 00:25:26,006
Manager's wife

00:25:26,073 --> 00:25:27,841
confirmed she checked in
last night.

00:25:27,908 --> 00:25:28,975
(computer chirping)

00:25:31,878 --> 00:25:33,947
Man, she's only 32.

00:25:34,014 --> 00:25:36,283
Long years, though.

00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:39,553
Just got released
from Arizona state pen.

00:25:39,619 --> 00:25:42,189
Nine years on a narco rap.

00:25:42,255 --> 00:25:43,790
Lot of priors before that,
mostly drugs.

00:25:43,857 --> 00:25:45,359
Foam around the mouth.

00:25:45,425 --> 00:25:47,194
Clothes are damp
from sweat.

00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,462
Both indicate overdose.

00:25:48,528 --> 00:25:49,663
Where's all her stuff?

00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:51,098
There isn't any.

00:25:51,164 --> 00:25:53,233
She could have just checked in
to use.

00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,402
Then where's the paraphernalia?

00:25:55,469 --> 00:25:57,804
Flushed the evidence
before the high killed her?

00:25:57,871 --> 00:25:59,973
Hey, Nick,

00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,943
I hear you're putting together
a college fund

00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:05,245
for Warrick's son?

00:26:05,312 --> 00:26:06,413
Well...

00:26:11,785 --> 00:26:14,287
Thank you, David.
Appreciate it.

00:26:14,354 --> 00:26:16,089
So what's with
the shattered lamp?

00:26:16,156 --> 00:26:18,558
PHILLIPS:
She could have knocked it over
during her OD seizure.

00:26:18,625 --> 00:26:21,461
Or there was someone else
in here with her.

00:26:21,528 --> 00:26:23,897
They could have used together,
had a fight.

00:26:23,964 --> 00:26:26,833
Could have grabbed
Tanya's stuff and bailed.

00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:31,405
(rhythmic thudding,
man and woman moaning)

00:26:31,471 --> 00:26:33,607
WOMAN:
Oh, God!

00:26:35,909 --> 00:26:38,211
Maybe <i>they</i> heard something.

00:26:38,278 --> 00:26:40,714
I'm on it.

00:26:42,082 --> 00:26:43,550
MAN:
Oh!

00:26:46,053 --> 00:26:48,522
Uh, hi.
From the Lime Crab.

00:26:48,588 --> 00:26:50,457
The Crab Lime.

00:26:50,524 --> 00:26:52,526
No, I am from the Crime Lab.

00:26:54,161 --> 00:26:55,595
Were you here last night, sir?

00:26:55,662 --> 00:26:59,066
Hmm. Hey, sweetheart,
firecracker wants to know

00:26:59,132 --> 00:27:00,534
if we were here
last night.

00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,602
Oh, yeah, we were
here, all right.

00:27:02,669 --> 00:27:03,870
We were here, 

00:27:03,937 --> 00:27:07,074
over there and
back there

00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,809
and everywhere till my lumbar
went out.

00:27:08,875 --> 00:27:11,044
That's lumbar,
mind you,

00:27:11,111 --> 00:27:12,913
not lumber.
Okay, that's...

00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:16,383
Thank you.
Sir, were you taping last night?

00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:19,619
Oh, yeah, live at 11:00,
12:00 and 1:00.

00:27:22,756 --> 00:27:25,592
(woman and man moaning)

00:27:25,659 --> 00:27:30,097
All right, so I'll work on
amplifying and isolating

00:27:30,163 --> 00:27:31,832
the background noises from
the neighboring room.

00:27:31,898 --> 00:27:34,501
And I'll try to scrub my
mental tape deck of the rest.

00:27:34,568 --> 00:27:36,003
Mm-hmm.

00:27:36,069 --> 00:27:39,673
The frequency range
for a live human voice

00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,875
is much broader
than what comes out

00:27:41,942 --> 00:27:44,711
of a crappy motel
TV-set speaker.

00:27:45,746 --> 00:27:47,014
(indistinct voices)

00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,915
How many voices?

00:27:48,982 --> 00:27:50,584
Two, from what
I can tell.

00:27:50,651 --> 00:27:52,119
And judging from the pitch,

00:27:52,185 --> 00:27:53,420
they're both female.

00:27:53,487 --> 00:27:55,989
Well, can you tell
if they're arguing or what?

00:27:56,056 --> 00:27:58,158
They're pretty loud.

00:27:58,225 --> 00:28:00,794
They'd have to be to get through
the walls, even thin ones.

00:28:02,763 --> 00:28:04,698
I'm afraid we don't know
much at all.

00:28:04,765 --> 00:28:08,335
We know the cause of death
was multiple organ failure

00:28:08,402 --> 00:28:11,405
due to oral ingestion
of methamphetamine.

00:28:11,471 --> 00:28:15,075
A lot more than a
recreational dose.

00:28:15,142 --> 00:28:18,178
My colleagues tell me there
was someone else in the room.

00:28:18,245 --> 00:28:19,546
Possibly a fight.

00:28:19,613 --> 00:28:21,715
But as far as what else
happened to your daughter,

00:28:21,782 --> 00:28:23,250
we really don't know.

00:28:23,317 --> 00:28:25,385
I'm sorry, Mr. Carrow.

00:28:25,452 --> 00:28:27,321
I know you deserve
more answers.

00:28:28,355 --> 00:28:30,223
No, I don't.

00:28:31,625 --> 00:28:34,861
You know, you think
it's gonna be easy.

00:28:34,928 --> 00:28:36,863
Even with her mom dead

00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:38,932
and you busting your ass
working every day,

00:28:38,999 --> 00:28:40,867
small town like Eagar, Arizona,
you figure, you know,

00:28:40,934 --> 00:28:44,438
what do you got to do
to keep her out of trouble?

00:28:44,504 --> 00:28:49,876
By 16, she was
already gone:

00:28:49,943 --> 00:28:52,312
drugs and juvie.

00:28:56,149 --> 00:28:58,185
It's lost.

00:29:01,955 --> 00:29:05,058
It's a long ride up here,

00:29:05,125 --> 00:29:07,060
and I realized
that was probably

00:29:07,127 --> 00:29:10,163
about the most time
I'd ever spent on her.

00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:14,234
Hadn't really talked
for ten years.

00:29:16,737 --> 00:29:18,505
So, no, I...

00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,909
I don't know what she
and the world owed each other,

00:29:22,976 --> 00:29:24,945
but, uh...

00:29:28,215 --> 00:29:30,350
I don't deserve any answers.

00:29:31,451 --> 00:29:34,454

00:30:59,206 --> 00:31:01,141
BRASS:
Okay, here's what we got.

00:31:01,208 --> 00:31:03,076
The victim
is a 16-year-old girl

00:31:03,143 --> 00:31:04,511
who lives here
on the premises.

00:31:04,578 --> 00:31:06,580
She's the daughter
of Mark and Nicole Jones

00:31:06,647 --> 00:31:08,115
who run the motel.

00:31:08,181 --> 00:31:10,117
You remember them,
don't you?

00:31:17,924 --> 00:31:19,593
I knew her.

00:31:27,024 --> 00:31:29,293
PHILLIPS:
She was stabbed in the chest.

00:31:31,629 --> 00:31:33,731
Nick?

00:31:33,798 --> 00:31:36,634
Nick, looks like
a single wound.

00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,669
Yeah, close kill
like this,

00:31:38,736 --> 00:31:40,171
the killer's probably
covered with blood.

00:31:40,237 --> 00:31:42,106
(camera shutter clicking)

00:31:42,173 --> 00:31:45,009
So, the girl's parents
were inside the apartment
when this happened.

00:31:45,076 --> 00:31:46,911
The didn't hear anything.

00:31:46,977 --> 00:31:49,080
They came out and found her like
this, but we have a suspect.

00:31:49,146 --> 00:31:51,348
The victim broke up with
her boyfriend yesterday.

00:31:51,415 --> 00:31:52,716
Things got ugly,
officers responded,

00:31:52,783 --> 00:31:55,119
so we're bringing
him in now. Good luck.

00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:04,929
I heard this one was
personal for you.

00:32:06,864 --> 00:32:10,434
Hey, Nick,
I found this in her pocket.

00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:15,372
Same hairstyle,
not the same girl, though.

00:32:15,439 --> 00:32:18,375
I'll spiral out,
see if I can find the weapon.

00:32:18,442 --> 00:32:19,944
Okay.

00:32:23,881 --> 00:32:25,850
ZACK:
<i>A few months ago, she came</i>

00:32:25,916 --> 00:32:29,386
to me and she said
that she had a vision.

00:32:29,453 --> 00:32:30,888
That's what she called it.

00:32:30,955 --> 00:32:34,625
A miraculous vision
of her destiny.

00:32:34,692 --> 00:32:36,761
And she said that
she was going to

00:32:36,827 --> 00:32:39,463
embrace that destiny today.

00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:42,032
She just told me

00:32:42,099 --> 00:32:45,336
about it yesterday.

00:32:45,403 --> 00:32:47,338
So she dumped you for St. Peter.

00:32:50,074 --> 00:32:51,509
I'm gonna ask you again.

00:32:51,575 --> 00:32:52,810
Where were you tonight?

00:32:52,877 --> 00:32:55,279
I don't, I don't...

00:32:56,881 --> 00:32:58,682
(whispers):
I was slinging crystal.

00:33:04,588 --> 00:33:07,691
We're going to need a, uh,
a promise of immunity

00:33:07,758 --> 00:33:11,162
before my client
reveals his alibi to you.

00:33:11,228 --> 00:33:13,564
I'll mention it to the DA.
He is not saying anything

00:33:13,631 --> 00:33:15,399
until we've been legally assured
against prosecution.

00:33:15,466 --> 00:33:17,301
I was in Reno.

00:33:17,368 --> 00:33:18,736
Zack, please!

00:33:18,803 --> 00:33:22,573
I was in Reno and I was...
I was there slinging crystal.

00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,341
I was dealing drugs.

00:33:24,408 --> 00:33:26,143
That's what I do.

00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:30,648
And Haley, she helped me.

00:33:30,714 --> 00:33:35,553
But if that's why she didn't
want to be with me anymore,

00:33:35,619 --> 00:33:40,257
why I wasn't
"fit for her destiny..."

00:33:40,324 --> 00:33:42,159
I would have changed.

00:33:42,226 --> 00:33:44,862
She didn't use drugs.
I didn't have to.

00:33:44,929 --> 00:33:48,332
I would have done
whatever she wanted.

00:33:51,368 --> 00:33:53,471
Now, the photo you found
in the victim's pocket...

00:33:53,537 --> 00:33:54,872
I asked Archie
to blow it up.

00:33:54,939 --> 00:33:56,173
Well, at first we thought

00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,242
this girl and her
baby were in a park.

00:33:58,309 --> 00:33:59,777
You see
the barbed wire?
Mm-hmm.

00:33:59,844 --> 00:34:00,945
It's not a park.

00:34:01,011 --> 00:34:02,379
It's a prison.

00:34:02,446 --> 00:34:04,448
White Sands Youth Detention
Center, Arizona.

00:34:04,515 --> 00:34:05,783
You see the logo

00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:06,984
on the guy's jacket?

00:34:07,051 --> 00:34:08,819
Any idea when
this was taken?
Yes.

00:34:08,886 --> 00:34:12,256
Archie dated the Polaroid
stock by batch number,

00:34:12,323 --> 00:34:14,125
narrowed it down to 1993.

00:34:14,191 --> 00:34:16,293
Now, the foliage here
suggests summer,

00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,362
so we checked
the facility's records.

00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:21,799
Three Caucasian inmates
gave birth that summer.

00:34:21,866 --> 00:34:24,335
One of those babies had the
same birth date as Haley Jones.

00:34:24,402 --> 00:34:25,469
So Haley was adopted.

00:34:25,536 --> 00:34:27,037
Mm-hmm.

00:34:27,104 --> 00:34:29,707
What's her name,
the birth mother?

00:34:29,774 --> 00:34:31,475
Tanya Carrow.

00:34:35,646 --> 00:34:38,048
Overdosed
at the Park Pines

00:34:38,115 --> 00:34:39,450
back in November.
Tanya Carrow.

00:34:39,517 --> 00:34:41,085
She went
and found her daughter.

00:34:41,152 --> 00:34:43,220
Mark and Nicole Jones
denied knowing her.

00:34:43,287 --> 00:34:46,056
They might be telling the truth
if it was a blind adoption.

00:34:46,123 --> 00:34:48,125
Pull my other leg
and it plays "Jingle Bells."

00:34:52,930 --> 00:34:54,198
(tapping on glass)

00:34:54,265 --> 00:34:56,367
Hi, uh, my name is Tanya.

00:34:56,434 --> 00:34:57,935
Tanya Carrow.
Remember me?

00:34:58,002 --> 00:34:59,937
Um, I'm not here
to make trouble.

00:35:00,004 --> 00:35:02,273
I was just wondering if
I could see my daughter.

00:35:02,339 --> 00:35:05,676
BRASS:
<i>We had Tanya's</i>
<i>juvie record unsealed.</i>

00:35:05,743 --> 00:35:08,679
She was 16 years old. She
was babysitting your daughter.

00:35:08,746 --> 00:35:09,980
We would never have
left Melissa with her

00:35:10,047 --> 00:35:11,515
if we had known
that she was...

00:35:11,582 --> 00:35:13,250
Getting high?

00:35:13,317 --> 00:35:15,886
We... We were just
going to the movies,

00:35:15,953 --> 00:35:19,190
and we had asked Tanya
if she would

00:35:19,256 --> 00:35:22,726
give Melissa a bath
before she put her down.

00:35:22,793 --> 00:35:24,795
She left her in the tub.

00:35:28,632 --> 00:35:30,367
She drowned.

00:35:31,936 --> 00:35:35,439
Okay, so Tanya's in juvie.
She finds out she's pregnant.

00:35:35,506 --> 00:35:38,476
And that's when we get
this call that, um...

00:35:38,542 --> 00:35:40,945
she wants to make amends.

00:35:43,214 --> 00:35:44,849
A life for a life.

00:35:44,915 --> 00:35:47,284
Haley for Melissa?

00:35:47,351 --> 00:35:49,587
So, 16 years later,
she shows up,

00:35:49,653 --> 00:35:51,756
wants to see Haley,
who doesn't even know

00:35:51,822 --> 00:35:53,224
she's adopted.

00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:55,559
What do you do?

00:35:55,626 --> 00:35:58,095
I gave her a room.

00:35:58,162 --> 00:35:59,463
She never checked out,
so what happened?

00:36:01,866 --> 00:36:03,834
Nicole went to see her
that night.

00:36:03,901 --> 00:36:07,571
She went to her room
and, um...

00:36:07,638 --> 00:36:10,007
she told Tanya

00:36:10,074 --> 00:36:14,145
that she would never,
ever see Haley.

00:36:14,211 --> 00:36:16,580
They fought.

00:36:16,647 --> 00:36:20,651
Tanya agreed that, um...
she'd leave.

00:36:22,653 --> 00:36:26,357
I kinda figured
the disappointment...

00:36:26,424 --> 00:36:28,292
I guess that's

00:36:28,359 --> 00:36:30,561
what made Tanya
kill herself.

00:36:30,628 --> 00:36:32,830
Are you sure
she killed herself?

00:37:05,529 --> 00:37:07,231
(tapping on glass)

00:37:07,298 --> 00:37:08,632
No coffee breaks right now,

00:37:08,699 --> 00:37:11,035
my man.

00:37:11,102 --> 00:37:13,070
(sighing)

00:37:13,137 --> 00:37:14,238
Yeah?

00:37:14,305 --> 00:37:15,406
I'm moving, into a dorm.

00:37:15,473 --> 00:37:16,474
Got a student loan.

00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:18,075
W.L.V.U.

00:37:18,142 --> 00:37:19,810
Hospitality Studies.

00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:24,648
Oh, a few months ago,
I saw something.

00:37:26,584 --> 00:37:28,119
<i>Mrs. Jones came out</i>
<i>of room eight</i>

00:37:28,185 --> 00:37:29,587
<i>with two coffee cups.</i>

00:37:29,653 --> 00:37:30,855
<i>I thought</i>
<i>it was strange she went</i>

00:37:30,921 --> 00:37:32,022
<i>all the way over there</i>
<i>to toss them.</i>

00:37:37,661 --> 00:37:40,064
<i>I could smell the meth.</i>

00:37:40,131 --> 00:37:42,767
The next morning you were here
and that woman in room eight...

00:37:42,833 --> 00:37:44,902
She was dead.
I didn't tell you
about it at the time

00:37:44,969 --> 00:37:47,204
because I figured you wouldn't
believe somebody like me.

00:37:47,271 --> 00:37:49,273
The old me.

00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,875
LANGSTON:
Nick?

00:37:50,941 --> 00:37:52,943
I found this under
the mattress.

00:38:03,487 --> 00:38:05,389
It was an accident.

00:38:05,456 --> 00:38:07,324
I was in the office.

00:38:07,391 --> 00:38:10,127
Haley came in.

00:38:10,194 --> 00:38:12,596
With that hair.

00:38:12,663 --> 00:38:14,665
I told her it looked disgusting

00:38:14,732 --> 00:38:16,434
and that she would
have to dye it back,

00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,569
or I'd cut it off.

00:38:18,636 --> 00:38:19,737
So she stormed out.

00:38:19,804 --> 00:38:20,905
I grabbed the scissors.

00:38:20,971 --> 00:38:23,207
You were just trying
to give her a haircut?

00:38:23,274 --> 00:38:26,310
I was just trying to scare
her a little, to finally

00:38:26,377 --> 00:38:28,312
get her to do something
that I wanted for once.

00:38:28,379 --> 00:38:30,247
You dye it back

00:38:30,314 --> 00:38:31,715
or I swear to God,
I will cut it myself.

00:38:31,782 --> 00:38:33,084
Leave me alone!

00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:34,251
You little bitch!

00:38:34,318 --> 00:38:35,519
I hate you!
I've always hated...

00:38:35,586 --> 00:38:38,522
(stabbing and gasping)

00:38:56,574 --> 00:38:58,109
STOKES:
<i>Why didn't you call 911?</i>

00:38:58,175 --> 00:39:00,544
I don't know.

00:39:03,581 --> 00:39:06,517
She was dead
when she hit the ground. I...

00:39:06,584 --> 00:39:08,719
I panicked.

00:39:08,786 --> 00:39:10,554
Her hair, huh?

00:39:10,621 --> 00:39:13,224
It wasn't just the hair.

00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:14,792
It was everything.

00:39:14,859 --> 00:39:18,829
It was the mouth,
the attitude, her boyfriend...

00:39:18,896 --> 00:39:21,732
She was just always
trying to get to me.

00:39:21,799 --> 00:39:24,034
The hair... the hairstyle,
it was just one more thing.

00:39:24,101 --> 00:39:26,003
Something that I would hate.
Yeah, because

00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:28,639
it made her look
exactly like Tanya.

00:39:28,706 --> 00:39:32,276
That is her
real mother, right?

00:39:32,343 --> 00:39:34,712
The one that
killed your daughter.

00:39:34,779 --> 00:39:37,381
And who you killed
four months ago.

00:39:37,448 --> 00:39:38,849
She was an addict.

00:39:38,916 --> 00:39:40,117
She killed herself.

00:39:40,184 --> 00:39:42,486
We talked to
Haley's boyfriend.

00:39:42,553 --> 00:39:47,224
He told us about the stash of
meth Haley was holding for him.

00:39:47,291 --> 00:39:49,860
It was hidden in her room.

00:39:49,927 --> 00:39:52,696
And when it went missing,
they figured, you found it,

00:39:52,763 --> 00:39:54,598
flushed it.

00:39:54,665 --> 00:39:58,169
But you didn't flush it,
did you, Mrs. Jones?

00:39:58,235 --> 00:40:01,105
Zack volunteered
a sample of the meth,

00:40:01,172 --> 00:40:03,040
and we matched it
to the drugs that were found

00:40:03,107 --> 00:40:05,609
in Tanya's stomach
the night she died.

00:40:05,676 --> 00:40:08,446
And I have an eyewitness
that saw you

00:40:08,512 --> 00:40:11,048
toss two coffee cups
into the Dumpster that night.

00:40:11,115 --> 00:40:13,317
One of which
was laced with meth.

00:40:17,922 --> 00:40:20,524
How did you get her
to drink it, Nicole?

00:40:20,591 --> 00:40:22,126
Hmm?

00:40:22,193 --> 00:40:24,061
Was it a peace offering?

00:40:24,128 --> 00:40:26,363
She had no right
to just show up.

00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:27,565
So you killed her.

00:40:27,631 --> 00:40:29,400
No.
Yeah.

00:40:29,467 --> 00:40:36,107
And when you saw that Haley
looked exactly like Tanya at 16,

00:40:36,173 --> 00:40:37,508
you killed her again.

00:40:39,376 --> 00:40:42,480
I never wanted her.

00:40:42,546 --> 00:40:47,218
Mark brought her
into our home.

00:40:47,284 --> 00:40:49,186
I had a daughter.

00:40:49,253 --> 00:40:52,356
She was murdered.

00:40:52,423 --> 00:40:57,294
So I'm supposed to let the ghost
of that murderer live with me?

00:40:57,361 --> 00:41:00,197
Sleep in the next room?

00:41:15,713 --> 00:41:18,816
You all right?

00:41:20,985 --> 00:41:23,287
She didn't have to die, Ray.

00:41:23,354 --> 00:41:24,955
You're right.

00:41:25,022 --> 00:41:27,391
She didn't have to die.

00:41:33,497 --> 00:41:37,435
You aren't beating yourself
up about this, are you?

00:41:37,501 --> 00:41:38,803
(sighs)

00:41:38,869 --> 00:41:40,971
If I could have figured out
what was going on

00:41:41,038 --> 00:41:43,741
in Tanya Carrow's murder sooner,

00:41:43,808 --> 00:41:45,476
then Nicole Jones
would've been locked up.

00:41:45,543 --> 00:41:48,446
Haley would still be alive.

00:41:48,512 --> 00:41:51,515
I knew you were
a fellow masochist.

00:41:51,582 --> 00:41:54,185
(chuckling)

00:41:54,251 --> 00:41:56,353
Tell me what your favorite form
of self-flagellation is.

00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:58,589
Tell you
what I like to do.

00:41:58,656 --> 00:41:59,790
Get on the Internet.

00:41:59,857 --> 00:42:02,426
Go to a Web site,
movie site.

00:42:02,493 --> 00:42:05,229
Find my favorite movie
of the moment.

00:42:05,296 --> 00:42:07,364
And then I like to read
all the comments telling me

00:42:07,431 --> 00:42:11,969
why I'm wrong and
have such terrible taste.

00:42:12,036 --> 00:42:17,274
And when I really can't sleep,
I like to sculpt orchids

00:42:17,341 --> 00:42:19,977
because it's
the only thing that will

00:42:20,044 --> 00:42:23,347
silence the voices in my head.

00:42:25,649 --> 00:42:29,353
But tonight,
there's only one voice.

00:42:34,992 --> 00:42:38,896
And she keeps asking me
what happened.

00:42:38,963 --> 00:42:40,531
What happened?

00:42:40,598 --> 00:42:43,434
What happened is a young girl
died because of events

00:42:43,501 --> 00:42:46,504
that were set in motion
long before she was ever born.

00:42:50,674 --> 00:42:53,944
It doesn't make it feel
any better, does it?

00:42:54,011 --> 00:42:55,713
(sobbing)

00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:57,047
You know, Nick?

00:42:57,114 --> 00:43:01,285
Everyone keeps telling me
what this job isn't.

00:43:04,388 --> 00:43:07,358
How you feel right now

00:43:07,425 --> 00:43:09,360
tells me what it is.

00:43:12,229 --> 00:43:14,198
I'm so sorry, Nick.
