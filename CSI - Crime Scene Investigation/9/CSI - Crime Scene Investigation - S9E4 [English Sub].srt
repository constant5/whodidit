00:00:06,974 --> 00:00:07,975
(weakly):
Help...

00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,911
(louder):
Help.

00:00:10,978 --> 00:00:14,715
I need, I
need... brains.

00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:16,116
Brains.

00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:17,751
I smell your brains.

00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:18,852
(laughs)

00:00:18,919 --> 00:00:20,020
RILEY:
Halloween's tomorrow, Nick.

00:00:20,087 --> 00:00:22,489
Yeah, in Vegas, we
celebrate all week.

00:00:22,556 --> 00:00:24,024
Yeah, we're just
getting some coffee.

00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:25,959
We'll be there
in five.

00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,728
We need to process
another 407.

00:00:27,794 --> 00:00:29,963
Liquor store,
Landston and Fifth.

00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,431
Let me guess:
robbed by a cop?

00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:33,267
Yeah, third one
tonight.

00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:34,268
Great costumes.

00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:35,869
That's what I wore
last year.

00:00:35,936 --> 00:00:37,404
Me, too.

00:00:37,471 --> 00:00:38,872
(door bells jingle)
Hey!

00:00:39,907 --> 00:00:41,275
Stop that guy!

00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:42,743
That cop
just robbed me!

00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:44,811
(glass bottles clattering)

00:00:48,845 --> 00:00:49,531
Stop!

00:00:49,531 --> 00:00:50,799
Police! Stop!

00:00:52,801 --> 00:00:54,236
(panting)

00:01:00,175 --> 00:01:01,476
(gunfire,
bullets ricocheting)

00:01:01,543 --> 00:01:03,111
Down! Down!

00:01:03,178 --> 00:01:04,913
(glass shattering)

00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,782
(grunts)

00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:09,518
He's going inside.
I'm going after him!

00:01:09,584 --> 00:01:10,652
What?
You go around front.

00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:12,154
Call for help!
Are you sure?

00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:13,588
Go!

00:01:14,623 --> 00:01:15,624
(beep)

00:01:15,691 --> 00:01:16,625
Control, CSI Adams.

00:01:16,692 --> 00:01:18,293
I got a 443 in the alley behind

00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,661
<i>the liquor store on Industrial.</i>

00:01:19,728 --> 00:01:20,796
<i>Shots fired.</i>

00:01:20,862 --> 00:01:21,997
<i>I repeat: shots fired.</i>

00:01:22,064 --> 00:01:23,565
<i>Suspect is wearing</i>
<i>a blue police uniform.</i>

00:01:23,632 --> 00:01:25,634
<i>CSI Stokes is in foot pursuit.</i>

00:01:29,237 --> 00:01:30,439
Hey!

00:01:30,505 --> 00:01:31,440
(gunfire blasting)

00:01:31,506 --> 00:01:33,809
(steam hissing)

00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:35,877
(panting)

00:02:03,372 --> 00:02:05,307
(grunting)

00:02:19,054 --> 00:02:20,055
That's it!

00:02:20,122 --> 00:02:21,356
That's it! It's over!

00:02:21,423 --> 00:02:23,025
Stay down.

00:02:24,026 --> 00:02:26,061
Come on, man. Don't.

00:02:30,132 --> 00:02:31,133
(screaming)

00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:32,167
(crash)

00:02:32,234 --> 00:02:35,504
(sirens approaching)

00:02:44,379 --> 00:02:47,449
Guy's robbed
his last liquor store.

00:02:55,223 --> 00:02:57,793
He's got company.

00:02:59,494 --> 00:03:01,530
(indistinct radio chatter)

00:03:01,596 --> 00:03:04,866
GRISSOM:
You know, Nick. You're lucky
you're not in here, too.

00:03:04,933 --> 00:03:06,935
STOKES:
Understood.

00:03:09,838 --> 00:03:11,773
Well...

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,009
I guess a broken mirror
does bring bad luck.

00:03:15,143 --> 00:03:18,113
Guy died for small bills,

00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,916
beef jerky and a porno.

00:03:20,983 --> 00:03:23,285
ADAMS:
Hard up, hungry
and dumb.

00:03:23,352 --> 00:03:25,153
It's no way to go
through life.

00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,254
GRISSOM:
Yeah, well, at least

00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:28,056
he helped us find
this poor dead girl.

00:03:28,123 --> 00:03:29,858
Dumpster belongs
to the glass

00:03:29,925 --> 00:03:31,893
and mirror place.

00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,130
Patrol company said
the owner closed up at 5:00.

00:03:36,164 --> 00:03:38,233
She smells fresh.

00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:42,070
Well, this was
a dark alley.

00:03:42,137 --> 00:03:43,538
Maybe she was
a working girl.

00:03:43,605 --> 00:03:45,574
Picked up a john
with a bad temper.

00:03:45,641 --> 00:03:46,575
Yeah.

00:03:46,642 --> 00:03:48,343
Trick or treat.

Take a look at this.

00:05:23,773 --> 00:05:26,609
STOKES:
Is that a tattoo?


00:05:28,611 --> 00:05:30,813
A fish.


00:05:34,183 --> 00:05:36,219
It's temporary ink.


00:05:36,286 --> 00:05:38,288
Could be a transfer or a stamp


00:05:38,354 --> 00:05:39,289
from a club.


00:05:39,355 --> 00:05:41,057
Back in St. Louis,
Vice always kept


00:05:41,124 --> 00:05:42,625
a database of club stamps.


00:05:42,692 --> 00:05:44,394
Our guys will know
where it came from.


00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,628
Maybe if we can
figure out


00:05:45,695 --> 00:05:47,330
where she was,
it will lead us


00:05:47,397 --> 00:05:49,966
to who she is.


00:05:52,368 --> 00:05:55,338
(dance music blaring)


00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:11,354
I hate Halloween.


00:06:11,421 --> 00:06:13,356
Looks like a bunch
of adults


00:06:13,423 --> 00:06:15,658
going as teenagers
this year.


00:06:35,211 --> 00:06:37,447
Hey!


00:06:37,513 --> 00:06:38,614
She's underage.


00:06:38,681 --> 00:06:40,049
Touch her again,
you're going to jail.


00:06:40,116 --> 00:06:41,551
Whatever.
Mom!


00:06:41,618 --> 00:06:43,152
What do you think
you're doing here?
Dancing.


00:06:43,219 --> 00:06:44,988
What does it look like?
Where's the I.D.?


00:06:45,054 --> 00:06:46,990
Want a urine
sample, too?


00:06:47,056 --> 00:06:48,391
Draw my blood?


00:06:51,461 --> 00:06:52,895
Jasmine Davidov?


00:06:52,962 --> 00:06:54,530
Don't the police have
anything better to do


00:06:54,597 --> 00:06:56,566
than chase me down?
You bet we do,
Lindsey.


00:06:56,633 --> 00:06:58,468
A girl your age
was here last night.


00:06:58,534 --> 00:07:00,570
She was murdered.


00:07:01,771 --> 00:07:03,773
Just take her home.


00:07:05,942 --> 00:07:08,011
You moonlighting
as a bouncer now?


00:07:08,077 --> 00:07:10,580
When you have kids, you can
talk to me about it then.


00:07:10,647 --> 00:07:12,081
Well, we won't be talking
soon then.


00:07:12,148 --> 00:07:14,751
Vic was definitely working
the VIP section.


00:07:16,786 --> 00:07:18,721
She wasn't wearing
a wristband.


00:07:18,788 --> 00:07:20,723
She must have been juiced in
through the back.


00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:23,393
You only get a wristband if you
pay the cover at the front.


00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:25,061
Okay, next.


00:07:25,128 --> 00:07:26,429
There you go.


00:07:28,731 --> 00:07:30,733
Owner's over there.


00:07:34,837 --> 00:07:37,507
Finish puberty
somewhere else.


00:07:37,573 --> 00:07:39,409
Me and Mr. Big here
need to talk.


00:07:40,443 --> 00:07:42,445
See you in a bit, ladies.


00:07:46,983 --> 00:07:48,785
She was found
in a Dumpster


00:07:48,851 --> 00:07:50,620
about two blocks
from here.


00:07:50,687 --> 00:07:53,856
She was wearing one of
your slut-of-the week
stamps on her thigh.


00:07:53,923 --> 00:07:55,391
Recognize her?


00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:56,726
No.


00:07:56,793 --> 00:07:58,561
But I don't get a good look
at every girl


00:07:58,628 --> 00:07:59,796
who walks in through the door.


00:07:59,862 --> 00:08:01,597
Anything else I can


00:08:01,664 --> 00:08:03,967
help you with?
Yeah, as a matter
of fact, there is.


00:08:04,033 --> 00:08:06,235
I found my underage daughter
on your dance floor.


00:08:06,302 --> 00:08:07,804
I could card
everyone


00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,806
in the place right now
and shut you down.


00:08:09,872 --> 00:08:11,307
If your daughter
got in here,


00:08:11,374 --> 00:08:13,343
she was using a fake I.D.


00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:15,778
That's not poor club management.


00:08:15,845 --> 00:08:18,114
It's poor parenting.


00:08:18,181 --> 00:08:20,149
You don't want
to blame yourself,


00:08:20,216 --> 00:08:23,186
so you slap
a fine on me.


00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:26,422
A fine is going to be
the least of your worries.


00:08:31,694 --> 00:08:34,664
You know, it's one thing
when kids dress up
as a cop on Halloween,


00:08:34,731 --> 00:08:37,667
but when grown-ups do it--
it never ends well.


00:08:37,734 --> 00:08:39,669
Mm-mm.
Got an I.D. yet?


00:08:39,736 --> 00:08:41,671
Gun's unregistered.


00:08:41,738 --> 00:08:43,272
I dusted it.
Nothing but smudges.


00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:46,643
So, how did Rocky the Flying
Squirrel get his uniform?

00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:48,578
The patch is a Reno city seal,

00:08:48,645 --> 00:08:50,847
but anybody can get one
of those at a swap meet.

00:08:50,913 --> 00:08:53,816
Hand me the ALS, will you?

00:08:57,053 --> 00:08:58,788
What?
It's just
been a while

00:08:58,855 --> 00:09:00,623
since I've seen you
use one of those.

00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:02,091
Just like riding
a bicycle.

00:09:02,158 --> 00:09:03,760
What, you don't want
to share your toys?

00:09:03,826 --> 00:09:04,961
Please.
Mm.

00:09:05,028 --> 00:09:07,964
(beep, whirring)

00:09:08,031 --> 00:09:10,333
This is the pocket
where the cops keep their pens.

00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,003
And they're always forgetting
to retract the points.

00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:17,440
You know, I don't think
this is a costume.

00:09:17,507 --> 00:09:20,510
Okay, but real cops
don't wear prom shoes, man.

00:09:20,576 --> 00:09:22,779
So everything's fake
except the uniform.

00:09:22,845 --> 00:09:25,481
Which means, somewhere
a real cop was wearing it.

00:09:25,548 --> 00:09:26,849
Well, I'll
contact Reno.

00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:29,786
See if anybody was down here
on official business.

00:09:29,852 --> 00:09:32,288
SANDERS:
Sexy kitty, sexy nurse,

00:09:32,355 --> 00:09:34,457
sexy hula dancer,
guy dressed

00:09:34,524 --> 00:09:35,959
like pimp.

00:09:36,025 --> 00:09:37,994
These guys have
no imagination.

00:09:38,061 --> 00:09:40,797
Club's using monochromatic
daylight cameras at night.

00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:43,499
And they're all pointed
somewhere pretty much useless.

00:09:43,566 --> 00:09:45,802
Except for the front door.

00:09:45,868 --> 00:09:48,571
Now we don't have
our girl arriving.

00:09:48,638 --> 00:09:50,573
Consistent with her
not having wristband.

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,808
Right.

00:09:51,874 --> 00:09:53,676
But here she is leaving.

00:09:54,711 --> 00:09:57,613
She starts out
pretty upset.

00:09:59,582 --> 00:10:02,719
That's the club
owner, Craig Hess.

00:10:02,785 --> 00:10:04,687
Instant attitude adjustment.

00:10:04,754 --> 00:10:06,389
This is approximately

00:10:06,456 --> 00:10:08,591
four hours
before we found her.

00:10:08,658 --> 00:10:11,361
She's a VIP,
and they bounced her?

00:10:13,463 --> 00:10:15,598
What did that guy
say to her?

00:10:15,665 --> 00:10:17,634
(camera shutter clicking)

00:10:45,128 --> 00:10:47,830

00:11:05,682 --> 00:11:08,017
they appear to be superficial?

00:11:11,654 --> 00:11:13,256
Yeah.

00:11:13,323 --> 00:11:16,392
No vital response

00:11:33,242 --> 00:11:35,011
I don't know where she is.

00:11:41,851 --> 00:11:44,587
She's got needle marks

00:11:44,654 --> 00:11:46,022
No scar tissue.

00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:47,523
This has to be recent.

00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:48,858
Drug users

00:11:48,925 --> 00:11:52,161
don't usually start off
shooting it.

00:11:52,228 --> 00:11:54,564
Snort it or smoke it first.

00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,803
White powder in the nose,
most likely cocaine.

00:12:06,209 --> 00:12:07,343
Hives.

00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:11,014
Histamine reaction,
maybe from the drugs?

00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,484
Wonder if she told her parents
she was just going dancing

00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:16,686
and they
believed her.

00:12:16,753 --> 00:12:18,121
(knocking)

00:12:19,289 --> 00:12:21,357
Grissom, got something for you.

00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,761
Your female victim
popped up

00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:27,697
in the Homeland Security
database.

00:12:27,764 --> 00:12:29,499
Angela Marie Carlos.

00:12:29,565 --> 00:12:31,167
19, going
to college

00:12:31,234 --> 00:12:33,036
in Salt Lake City--
from Cali, Colombia.

00:12:33,102 --> 00:12:35,171
She's here on
a student visa?

00:12:35,238 --> 00:12:36,739
Yeah, but it gets
even better.

00:12:36,806 --> 00:12:38,741
Father is Juan Ramon Carlos.

00:12:38,808 --> 00:12:41,244
He's on a lot
of Top 10 lists:

00:12:41,311 --> 00:12:44,147
FBI, CIA, DEA.

00:12:44,213 --> 00:12:45,515
He's a major drug lord.

00:12:45,581 --> 00:12:48,484
So maybe somebody was trying
to get to him through her.

00:12:48,551 --> 00:12:50,820
What do we know
about his Vegas connections?

00:12:50,887 --> 00:12:53,156
Besides every
drug dealer in town?

00:12:53,222 --> 00:12:55,058
He's got a sister
in Henderson.

00:12:55,124 --> 00:12:57,560
I'm on my way
to make the notification.

00:12:58,594 --> 00:13:00,563
I'd like to go.

00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:10,073
I was there
the day she was born.

00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:12,075
That day
and every day since,

00:13:12,141 --> 00:13:15,211
I prayed to God
to protect her.

00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:19,315
But I think our family
has tried his patience too long.

00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:24,020
Miss Carlos,
I know there are no words

00:13:24,087 --> 00:13:26,956
that could possibly make this
easier to bear,

00:13:27,023 --> 00:13:30,526
but maybe helping us
find who took her away

00:13:30,593 --> 00:13:32,962
might bring you some comfort.

00:13:35,164 --> 00:13:37,634
When was the last time
that you saw Angela?

00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,702
Two months ago. (sniffles)

00:13:39,769 --> 00:13:42,705
When she went
to college in Utah.

00:13:42,772 --> 00:13:44,407
Until then,
she was living with me.

00:13:44,474 --> 00:13:46,309
(sniffles)

00:13:46,376 --> 00:13:47,944
Going to school here.

00:13:48,011 --> 00:13:49,479
Why Utah?

00:13:49,545 --> 00:13:52,081
Because it's
not Las Vegas.

00:13:52,148 --> 00:13:53,316
She's like her mother.

00:13:53,383 --> 00:13:55,618
She likes to party.

00:13:57,153 --> 00:13:59,555
Juan did not approve.

00:13:59,622 --> 00:14:01,324
Did you know

00:14:01,391 --> 00:14:02,625
that she was
back in town?

00:14:02,692 --> 00:14:04,227
No.

00:14:04,294 --> 00:14:05,628
Did she have many friends?

00:14:05,695 --> 00:14:08,031
Money buys you a lot of people,

00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:10,266
but... but not a lot of friends.

00:14:11,968 --> 00:14:13,903
Except for one
girl, Sylvie.

00:14:15,705 --> 00:14:18,841
They went
to high school together.

00:14:18,908 --> 00:14:20,376
They were
like sisters.

00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:22,312
They would talk all
night on the phone...

00:14:23,346 --> 00:14:26,449
Sleepovers and shopping and...

00:14:29,485 --> 00:14:31,354
You can...

00:14:31,421 --> 00:14:34,757
you can love someone
with your heart and your soul,

00:14:34,824 --> 00:14:38,061
but you can't protect them
24 hours a day.

00:14:39,095 --> 00:14:42,131
You can catch
whoever did this,

00:14:42,198 --> 00:14:44,367
but it doesn't matter.

00:14:44,434 --> 00:14:47,337
Juan will never forgive me.

00:14:47,403 --> 00:14:48,871
(sighs)

00:14:57,783 --> 00:14:59,485
STOKES: So why'd you
bring your uniform to Vegas?

00:14:59,552 --> 00:15:04,423
BRADY:
I brought it because I
was testifying in a case.

00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:06,659
Held over a couple
days for cross.

00:15:06,726 --> 00:15:07,793
Thanks.
Yeah.

00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,629
So I thought I'd
see the sights.

00:15:09,695 --> 00:15:12,698
What happened
to your uniform?

00:15:12,765 --> 00:15:15,134
Well, I'm walking
through the casino

00:15:15,201 --> 00:15:17,436
just minding my own...

00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:20,740
Hot girl comes up,
wants to buy me a drink.

00:15:20,806 --> 00:15:22,108
You know the type.

00:15:22,174 --> 00:15:23,609
Donut Dolly.

00:15:23,676 --> 00:15:24,877
Wanted to wear

00:15:24,944 --> 00:15:28,514
my uniform, use all the tools.

00:15:28,581 --> 00:15:31,050
You're a bad cop.
(Brady chuckling)

00:15:31,117 --> 00:15:32,318
You've been a bad boy,

00:15:32,385 --> 00:15:34,220
and I'm really gonna punish you.

00:15:34,287 --> 00:15:36,355
Yeah, you like that, don't you?

00:15:36,422 --> 00:15:37,623
(both laughing)

00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:39,525
I've been a
bad officer.

00:15:39,592 --> 00:15:43,396
I had to send my uniform out
to the hotel cleaners.

00:15:43,462 --> 00:15:45,598
That's smart.
Juries do find you more credible

00:15:45,665 --> 00:15:46,932
when you're not reeking
of champagne.

00:15:46,999 --> 00:15:47,967
So, when I didn't

00:15:48,034 --> 00:15:50,436
get it back,
I called housekeeping.

00:15:50,503 --> 00:15:52,171
They said they hung it
on the door.

00:15:52,238 --> 00:15:53,205
Okay.

00:15:53,272 --> 00:15:54,373
What hotel?

00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,708
Palermo.

00:15:55,775 --> 00:15:58,110
Room 914.

00:15:58,177 --> 00:16:01,247
I am gonna get hell
from my department.

00:16:01,314 --> 00:16:02,882
Mm-hmm.

00:16:02,948 --> 00:16:04,617
But it was worth it.

00:16:05,651 --> 00:16:08,421
See what I can do,
Casanova.

00:16:08,487 --> 00:16:09,956
If Angela's in trouble,

00:16:10,022 --> 00:16:12,258
I'm talking to her
before I'm talking to you.

00:16:12,325 --> 00:16:14,427
Well, she's more
than in trouble.

00:16:14,493 --> 00:16:16,128
She's dead.

00:16:18,497 --> 00:16:19,598
(sighs)

00:16:19,665 --> 00:16:21,834
Were you with her
the night before last?

00:16:21,901 --> 00:16:24,770
Ange said Salt Lake
was lame for Halloween

00:16:24,837 --> 00:16:26,906
and she was road-tripping it
to Vegas.

00:16:26,973 --> 00:16:29,075
We changed
at my place.

00:16:29,141 --> 00:16:33,346
Then Ange wanted to go
get some party supplies.

00:16:33,412 --> 00:16:34,647
Party supplies?

00:16:34,714 --> 00:16:36,716
I had friends
who could get us

00:16:36,782 --> 00:16:38,351
into the Dark Water Bar.

00:16:38,417 --> 00:16:40,519
Ange said she could take it
from there.

00:16:40,586 --> 00:16:43,122
She said the owner was a friend
of her family.

00:16:43,189 --> 00:16:46,192
(dance music playing, laughter)

00:16:46,258 --> 00:16:47,426
Here's to us.

00:16:48,628 --> 00:16:49,795
You trying to
get me killed?

00:16:49,862 --> 00:16:51,197
Come on.
Just help me out.

00:16:51,263 --> 00:16:52,765
Whatever you want,
I'll give you.

00:16:52,832 --> 00:16:54,600
What I want
is you out.

00:16:54,667 --> 00:16:56,268
Get your hands
off me.

00:16:56,335 --> 00:16:58,270
So, did you leave with her?

00:16:58,337 --> 00:16:59,972
No.

00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:01,774
I hooked up with this guy.

00:17:01,841 --> 00:17:05,544
Texted her to meet up
with us at some party.

00:17:05,611 --> 00:17:07,947
Weren't you worried
about what might happen to her?

00:17:08,014 --> 00:17:10,816
Nobody touches Angela.

00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:21,594
Now what?

00:17:21,661 --> 00:17:22,928
You lied.

00:17:22,995 --> 00:17:24,764
It means I like you.

00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:26,899
We have a witness...
and surveillance footage.

00:17:26,966 --> 00:17:29,502
Angela Carlos was here
the night she died,

00:17:29,568 --> 00:17:31,671
and you talked to her.

00:17:32,705 --> 00:17:34,473
Okay.

00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,976
Somebody who's not
working here anymore

00:17:37,043 --> 00:17:38,411
let her in through the back.

00:17:38,477 --> 00:17:41,314
As soon as I saw she was
in the club, I sent her out

00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,948
through the front.
So, you do know her?

00:17:43,015 --> 00:17:44,450
Did I say that?

00:17:44,517 --> 00:17:47,086
I think you do business
with her father.

00:17:47,153 --> 00:17:48,654
And that kind
of business

00:17:48,721 --> 00:17:50,923
can put you out of business.

00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:52,391
Who is her father?

00:17:54,093 --> 00:17:55,995
It's clear
on the video

00:17:56,062 --> 00:17:57,496
that whatever you said to her

00:17:57,563 --> 00:17:58,931
got her to leave.

00:17:58,998 --> 00:18:00,066
What was it?

00:18:00,132 --> 00:18:02,301
Rendezvous at your place,
drugs for sex?

00:18:02,368 --> 00:18:04,804
'Cause it wouldn't
be the first time.

00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:07,773
Arrested for statutory rape,
assault, and drug charges

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,976
with a 17-year-old girl.

00:18:10,042 --> 00:18:12,311
I was 21 years old.

00:18:12,378 --> 00:18:14,647
Those charges were dropped.

00:18:14,714 --> 00:18:17,450
Girl wants to party,
get a little bit rough--

00:18:17,516 --> 00:18:18,884
it's a date.

00:18:18,951 --> 00:18:21,120
She doesn't get flowers
in the morning--

00:18:21,187 --> 00:18:22,455
it's rape.

00:18:22,521 --> 00:18:24,223
Look, that's it.

00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:28,427
I'm done talking to you.

00:18:30,896 --> 00:18:33,666
PHILLIPS:
There's still something
in this wound.

00:18:33,733 --> 00:18:35,534
Glass.

00:18:35,601 --> 00:18:37,770
It's different from the other
shards in the dumpster.

00:18:37,837 --> 00:18:39,839
What do you notice
about the wound?

00:18:39,905 --> 00:18:41,240
It's red,
which suggests

00:18:41,307 --> 00:18:42,675
a vital response
to the incision.

00:18:42,742 --> 00:18:45,211
Appears to be
perimortem.

00:18:45,277 --> 00:18:47,013
Go for it.

00:18:56,355 --> 00:18:57,757
I'll get it to Trace.

00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,262
David.
Gil.

00:19:06,265 --> 00:19:09,235
You've got something
I've never seen before.

Said the chorus girl
to the bishop.

00:19:14,607 --> 00:19:16,542
GRISSOM:
No separation

00:19:16,609 --> 00:19:18,944
between the blood cells
and the serum.

00:19:19,011 --> 00:19:20,313
Her blood's hemolyzed.

00:19:20,379 --> 00:19:22,114
You usually only see that
when the body

00:19:22,181 --> 00:19:23,549
is in advanced decomp.

00:19:23,616 --> 00:19:26,852
An unknown chemical imbalance
triggered a pressure change

00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:29,922
<i>in the red blood cells,</i>
<i>which caused them to rupture.</i>

00:19:29,989 --> 00:19:31,357
What could cause this?

00:19:31,424 --> 00:19:32,591
Number of things.

00:19:32,658 --> 00:19:34,727
Autoimmune hemolytic anemia.

00:19:34,794 --> 00:19:36,195
Certain blood diseases.

00:19:36,262 --> 00:19:37,296
Transfusion reaction.

00:19:37,363 --> 00:19:39,532
Even chemical
warfare agents

00:19:39,598 --> 00:19:41,500
like sarin or ricin.

00:19:41,567 --> 00:19:43,736
Worth the trip, wasn't it?

00:19:43,803 --> 00:19:45,638
Hives associated
with any of those?

00:19:45,705 --> 00:19:47,073
Most of them.

00:19:47,139 --> 00:19:49,709
I've requested her
medical records, tox and DNA,

00:19:49,775 --> 00:19:52,611
and I'm waiting on those
before I certify C.O.D.

00:19:52,678 --> 00:19:53,913
Let me know.

00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,815
I will.
And, uh,

00:19:55,881 --> 00:19:57,416
yes, it was worth the trip.

00:21:23,269 --> 00:21:25,171
B&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;E, DUI...

00:21:25,237 --> 00:21:27,740
Add DOA to the list.

00:21:27,807 --> 00:21:31,510
(footsteps approaching)

00:21:31,577 --> 00:21:33,379
Oh.

00:21:33,446 --> 00:21:34,580
(beep)

00:21:34,647 --> 00:21:36,148
You're supposed
to be at home.

00:21:36,215 --> 00:21:38,084
That's what being
grounded means.

00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:40,086
I wasn't doing
anything wrong.

00:21:40,152 --> 00:21:42,355
I wasn't even drinking.

00:21:43,389 --> 00:21:45,658
Breathalyzer results.

00:21:45,725 --> 00:21:48,194
I made the cop
who drove me home test me.

00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:51,263
I know I shouldn't have
been using a fake I.D.,

00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:53,833
and I'm sorry.

00:21:53,899 --> 00:21:56,669
But you overreacted.

00:21:56,736 --> 00:21:59,205
I'll be the judge of that.

00:21:59,271 --> 00:22:01,874
I know you're dealing
with a lot right now,

00:22:01,941 --> 00:22:05,611
but you don't have
to worry about me.

00:22:05,678 --> 00:22:09,482
Thanks... but I will.

00:22:11,851 --> 00:22:13,786
And you're still grounded.

00:22:13,853 --> 00:22:16,322
(beep)
Oh, hey.

00:22:16,389 --> 00:22:18,224
Gil.

00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:22,228
So, I scored two tickets
to this Alec Knight lecture.

00:22:22,295 --> 00:22:25,731
He's, of course you know,
challenging the Russian claim

00:22:25,798 --> 00:22:29,969
that the Romanov remains found
in Ekaterinburg are authentic.

00:22:32,071 --> 00:22:33,873
Open bar.

00:22:33,939 --> 00:22:37,576
Are you asking me out?

00:22:37,643 --> 00:22:39,879
Is that a yes?

00:22:39,945 --> 00:22:43,282
Do you have the results
of the white powder

00:22:43,349 --> 00:22:45,418
that we found
in Angela Carlos' nose?

00:22:45,484 --> 00:22:47,720
Yes. It wasn't cocaine.

00:22:47,787 --> 00:22:50,222
Here, take a look.

00:22:50,289 --> 00:22:51,924
(clears throat)

00:22:51,991 --> 00:22:53,359
HODGES:
It's atropine.

00:22:53,426 --> 00:22:55,962
It's a stimulant often used
to cut coke or methamphetamine.

00:22:56,028 --> 00:23:00,066
But her tox report came
back negative for both.

00:23:00,132 --> 00:23:02,301
And atropine has a
paradoxical reaction

00:23:02,368 --> 00:23:05,604
as a tranquilizer
used on fish and other animals.

00:23:05,671 --> 00:23:09,408
So, how did it get in her nose?

00:23:13,012 --> 00:23:16,315
So, we're still on
for that lecture, right?

00:23:16,382 --> 00:23:18,117
Gil?

00:23:18,184 --> 00:23:19,552
I checked with the Palermo.

00:23:19,619 --> 00:23:21,387
Your Reno cop has a Tower room.

00:23:21,454 --> 00:23:23,956
Takes a special room key
to access those elevators.

00:23:24,023 --> 00:23:26,125
So, if the dead guy
swiped his uniform,

00:23:26,192 --> 00:23:28,294
he was either a guest
or an employee.

00:23:28,361 --> 00:23:31,097
We checked. He doesn't work
there, and he wasn't registered.

00:23:31,163 --> 00:23:32,398
What is a lowlife

00:23:32,465 --> 00:23:34,500
from Bakersfield doing
in patent leather shoes anyway?

00:23:34,567 --> 00:23:35,668
Who wears those things?

00:23:35,735 --> 00:23:37,003
Maybe he stole those, too.

00:23:37,069 --> 00:23:38,838
Yeah, or maybe he was in town

00:23:38,904 --> 00:23:40,439
for a wedding or reunion
or something,

00:23:40,506 --> 00:23:41,741
and they were rentals.

00:23:41,807 --> 00:23:43,776
I'm gonna check around.
I'll get back to you.

00:23:43,843 --> 00:23:46,512
Hey, where's
Catherine?

00:23:46,579 --> 00:23:47,813
Driving her daughter home.

00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,448
Back any minute. Why?

00:23:49,515 --> 00:23:51,150
I was just running
the dead girl's phone records.

00:23:51,217 --> 00:23:52,518
Got a GPS hit on her cell.

00:23:52,585 --> 00:23:54,820
If the killer's got it,
we've got him.
Yeah.

00:23:54,887 --> 00:23:56,088
And it's on the move.

00:23:56,155 --> 00:23:58,157
(siren whooping)

00:24:02,461 --> 00:24:04,463
(sirens blaring)

00:24:16,342 --> 00:24:18,177
Riley Adams, Las Vegas

00:24:18,244 --> 00:24:19,812
Crime Lab.

00:24:19,879 --> 00:24:21,514
Dump your load.

00:24:25,885 --> 00:24:29,789
Well, Angela's cell phone
is in there somewhere.

00:24:29,855 --> 00:24:31,824
SANDERS:
What's the number?

00:24:31,891 --> 00:24:34,026
555...

00:24:34,093 --> 00:24:36,162
0122.

00:24:38,064 --> 00:24:40,599
(phone rings faintly)

00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:52,945
(phone continues ringing)

00:24:57,450 --> 00:24:59,452
Here.

00:24:59,518 --> 00:25:01,520
(ringing stops)

00:25:23,409 --> 00:25:26,379
Bloody glass
and the victim's purse.

00:25:26,445 --> 00:25:29,348
If this truck stopped
at the Dark Water Bar,

00:25:29,415 --> 00:25:31,283
Craig Hess is looking dirty.

00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:33,519
Looks like crime scene cleanup.

00:25:38,075 --> 00:25:40,410
Got the garbage truck's route
from the company.

00:25:40,477 --> 00:25:42,813
We stopped the truck there.

00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,515
We found Angela Carlos
just off of Newall Street.

00:25:45,582 --> 00:25:47,284
Hmm.

00:25:47,351 --> 00:25:49,419
WILLOWS:
Not on the route.

00:25:49,486 --> 00:25:52,990
She was last seen
at the Dark Water Bar on Harmon,

00:25:53,056 --> 00:25:54,258
which isn't
on the route,

00:25:54,324 --> 00:25:55,659
either.

00:25:55,726 --> 00:25:57,261
Hey, what about

00:25:57,327 --> 00:25:58,862
the club owner's home address?

00:25:58,929 --> 00:26:01,298
"Craig Hess.

00:26:01,365 --> 00:26:03,734
"617 Cheery Bird Court,

00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,902
Henderson."

00:26:04,968 --> 00:26:06,737
Oh. Well, that's
way off the map.

00:26:06,803 --> 00:26:09,339
So, other than the fact
that he lied to us

00:26:09,406 --> 00:26:12,843
about knowing the vic,
we've got nothing on him.

00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,716
Wendy, what brings
you to my store?

00:26:19,783 --> 00:26:22,853
Well, I'm here on
the Angela Carlos case 'cause

00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:26,356
I just ran her exemplar blood,
and it came back a mixture.

00:26:26,423 --> 00:26:27,524
Oh, that's impossible.

00:26:27,591 --> 00:26:29,693
I drew it from the heart.
I don't know.

00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,396
I ran it twice, and both times,
it came back as a mixture

00:26:32,462 --> 00:26:33,931
of one female
and two male bloods.

00:26:36,066 --> 00:26:37,834
It's definitely
contaminated.

00:26:37,901 --> 00:26:40,871
Well, then it was contaminated
on your end.

00:26:40,938 --> 00:26:43,173
No, I don't...
I don't think so.

00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,375
(wry laugh)

00:26:45,442 --> 00:26:49,146
Well, regardless, I'm going
to need to get a clean exemplar.

00:26:49,213 --> 00:26:51,915
Fine.

00:27:03,727 --> 00:27:05,495
Would, uh,

00:27:05,562 --> 00:27:08,732
deep tissue from the quadricep
work for you, Ms. Simms?

00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:10,734
Yes, that'd be fine.

00:27:10,801 --> 00:27:12,369
Good.

00:27:16,173 --> 00:27:17,441
(horns honking)

00:27:17,507 --> 00:27:20,043
BRASS:
<i>Barry Wunderlick?</i>

00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:21,211
That his real name?

00:27:21,278 --> 00:27:23,347
Real enough to get him
a couple of tuxedoes

00:27:23,413 --> 00:27:24,781
and two pairs of
patent leathers.

00:27:24,848 --> 00:27:26,216
He rented them
three days ago.

00:27:26,283 --> 00:27:27,417
They were due
back yesterday.

00:27:27,484 --> 00:27:28,619
And Barry's from
Bakersfield, too.

00:27:28,685 --> 00:27:30,120
Oh, just like
our fake cop.

00:27:30,187 --> 00:27:32,589
Yeah, so I checked with
the Palermo, and get this.

00:27:32,656 --> 00:27:34,825
Wunderlick still has the room
right across the hall

00:27:34,892 --> 00:27:35,993
from Officer Brady.

00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:37,694
He was supposed to
check out yesterday,

00:27:37,761 --> 00:27:39,162
but his stuff's
still in there.

00:27:39,229 --> 00:27:40,430
And he did
get two keys.

00:27:40,497 --> 00:27:42,032
Oh... Let me get this straight.

00:27:42,099 --> 00:27:45,369
So, two guys from Bakersfield
come to Vegas, rent tuxedoes,

00:27:45,435 --> 00:27:47,137
steal a policeman's uniform,

00:27:47,204 --> 00:27:49,806
so that one of them can hold up
a couple of liquor stores.

00:27:49,873 --> 00:27:52,109
Is that the deal?
That's what
the evidence says.

00:27:52,175 --> 00:27:54,811
I'll flag his credit cards,
put a broadcast out.

00:27:54,878 --> 00:27:57,281
SIMMS:
<i>So I ran the tissue sample,</i>

00:27:57,347 --> 00:27:58,649
and it's clean.

00:27:58,715 --> 00:28:00,150
It's purely Angela Carlos.

00:28:00,217 --> 00:28:02,052
GRISSOM:
So the first

00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:03,787
blood test <i>was</i> contaminated?

00:28:03,854 --> 00:28:04,955
No. It...
No.

00:28:05,022 --> 00:28:06,123
It was a mixture.

00:28:06,189 --> 00:28:07,891
Three people's blood.

00:28:07,958 --> 00:28:09,693
It started me thinking,

00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,729
maybe her results
explain the hemolysis.

00:28:12,796 --> 00:28:15,232
So, then I ran the blood stain
from the glass

00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:17,234
that you pulled out
of the victim's wounds,

00:28:17,301 --> 00:28:19,236
and I used that
as a secondary standard.

00:28:19,303 --> 00:28:20,470
Same results.

00:28:20,537 --> 00:28:21,672
Confirmed the mixture

00:28:21,738 --> 00:28:23,807
of a female victim
and two unknown males.

00:28:23,874 --> 00:28:25,842
The only way
that could have happened

00:28:25,909 --> 00:28:27,945
was if she'd received
a blood transfusion.

00:28:28,011 --> 00:28:29,479
From multiple donors.

00:28:29,546 --> 00:28:31,715
With no medical
necessity.

00:28:31,782 --> 00:28:35,919
The victim was B-negative.

00:28:35,986 --> 00:28:38,488
One of the male donors
was O-negative.

00:28:38,555 --> 00:28:40,757
The other one-- A-positive.

00:28:40,824 --> 00:28:41,959
Then that's your COD.

00:28:42,025 --> 00:28:43,894
<i>A-positive would cause</i>

00:28:43,961 --> 00:28:46,964
<i>a major reaction</i>
<i>with her blood type.</i>

00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:49,766
Transfusion explains the, uh,
needle marks on her arms

00:28:49,833 --> 00:28:51,768
and the hives.

00:28:51,835 --> 00:28:53,337
If somebody was trying
to kill her,

00:28:53,403 --> 00:28:55,105
there were far easier ways
to do it.

00:28:55,172 --> 00:28:56,440
(sighs)

00:28:56,506 --> 00:28:58,809
Girl goes out
for a night on the town.

00:28:58,876 --> 00:29:00,978
Wants to score some drugs.

00:29:01,044 --> 00:29:03,614
Ends up with a snout
full of atropine

00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,282
and a double transfusion.

00:29:05,349 --> 00:29:07,117
And unfortunately, it's
impossible to separate

00:29:07,184 --> 00:29:08,552
the two male types
from each other,

00:29:08,619 --> 00:29:11,054
which means that I can't run
the DNA through CODIS.

00:29:11,121 --> 00:29:14,791
Which now leaves us
with <i>two</i> unknown suspects.

00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:23,500
Mr. Barry Wunderlick.

00:29:23,567 --> 00:29:26,003
This whole time we've
been looking for him,

00:29:26,069 --> 00:29:27,638
he's been our
house guest?

00:29:27,704 --> 00:29:30,274
Arrested three days ago,
drunk and disorderly.

00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:32,209
Couldn't post bail.

00:29:32,276 --> 00:29:34,077
I was just having me
a bachelor party

00:29:34,144 --> 00:29:35,312
at the Acid Strip.

00:29:35,379 --> 00:29:37,714
How did you run up a tab
of over five grand, Barry?

00:29:37,781 --> 00:29:38,882
Duh!

00:29:38,949 --> 00:29:40,050
It's Vegas.

00:29:40,117 --> 00:29:42,252
You want 'em to touch you,
you got to tip.

00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:43,420
There's a four-drink minimum.

00:29:43,487 --> 00:29:44,922
What?!
No, there isn't.

00:29:44,988 --> 00:29:46,590
Well, that's what
she said, bro.

00:29:46,657 --> 00:29:47,758
And you believed her?

00:29:47,824 --> 00:29:49,359
She was smokin'.

00:29:49,426 --> 00:29:51,595
Pushin' her junk up
in our face. Ooh!

00:29:51,662 --> 00:29:53,664
Then, they come
up and tell me

00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:55,799
that my credit card's
no good no more.

00:29:55,866 --> 00:29:57,200
They wanted cash.

00:29:57,267 --> 00:29:58,835
Is that how the manager

00:29:58,902 --> 00:30:00,938
and two bartenders
ended up in the ER?

00:30:01,004 --> 00:30:02,940
They were trying to screw us.

00:30:03,006 --> 00:30:04,474
(laughs and sniffles)

00:30:04,541 --> 00:30:06,310
They didn't realize
that they were messing

00:30:06,376 --> 00:30:07,678
with an ultimate fighter.

00:30:07,744 --> 00:30:10,013
Then, uh...

00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,015
Then you guys show up
and arrest my ass.

00:30:12,082 --> 00:30:14,084
What happened
to your friend Tommy?

00:30:14,151 --> 00:30:16,720
I told him, "Work up some cash

00:30:16,787 --> 00:30:19,423
and bail me out
before the wedding."

00:30:19,489 --> 00:30:21,425
