00:12:02,869 --> 00:12:04,137
Weird, huh?

00:12:04,204 --> 00:12:05,906
GRISSOM:
<i>The cab drops Samay Thao</i>

00:12:05,973 --> 00:12:07,607
<i>in front of this building.</i>

00:12:07,674 --> 00:12:10,277
<i>And the position</i>
<i>of the blood drops give us</i>

00:12:10,344 --> 00:12:12,612
<i>a pretty good idea</i>
<i>of where Samay was standing</i>

00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:13,780
<i>when he was shot.</i>

00:12:13,847 --> 00:12:16,750
He was a little shorter
than me.

00:12:16,817 --> 00:12:19,853
Shots were centered
on his chest, about there.

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,254
( <i>gunshot</i> )

00:12:21,321 --> 00:12:22,689
GRISSOM:
<i>My guess is,</i>

00:12:22,756 --> 00:12:24,791
the cab was parked down there

00:12:24,858 --> 00:12:28,061
<i>the driver peeled out</i>
<i>when he got shot.</i>

00:12:33,934 --> 00:12:37,270
Vertical deflection down to
the cab is roughly 60 degrees.

00:12:37,337 --> 00:12:41,141
Standard shot
won't spread that far.

00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:43,310
The pellets must have
come through the screen.

00:12:45,012 --> 00:12:47,080
( <i>gunshot</i> )

00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:51,885
The old billiard ball effect.

00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:56,156
The cab driver was
collateral damage.

00:12:56,223 --> 00:12:58,592
Okay, but the man
with the shotgun

00:12:58,659 --> 00:12:59,993
said he shot
a burglar.

00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,195
What's here
to steal?

00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:07,467
STOKES:
Semen on the bed sheets,

00:13:07,534 --> 00:13:11,038
as well as every other
flat surface in here.

00:13:11,104 --> 00:13:13,874
BROWN ( <i>chuckles</i> ):
Yeah.

00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:17,911
I've got vodka, champagne,
cocaine...

00:13:17,978 --> 00:13:19,546
STOKES:
Hey, hey.

00:13:19,613 --> 00:13:21,214
Pantyhose.

00:13:23,216 --> 00:13:25,886
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:13:29,423 --> 00:13:31,658
( <i>exhales</i> )

00:13:35,462 --> 00:13:38,465
I've got some smudges over here.

00:13:45,172 --> 00:13:47,908
I've got some footprints.

00:13:47,975 --> 00:13:52,145
Looks like someone was standing
right there.

00:13:52,212 --> 00:13:54,915
Was this guy just doing it
all over the hotel room?

00:13:57,517 --> 00:13:59,753
If those are
<i>his</i> footprints...

00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,655
where are hers?

00:14:01,722 --> 00:14:04,925
Or her feet were up...
in the air.

00:14:04,992 --> 00:14:07,260
You tell <i>me--</i> you just
had your honeymoon.

00:14:07,327 --> 00:14:11,131
You want to swab this?

00:14:15,902 --> 00:14:17,871
I just don't understand.

00:14:17,938 --> 00:14:20,073
I mean, who would want
to kill Julian?

00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,408
I mean, he'd had

00:14:21,475 --> 00:14:23,143
some weird fan mail,
but I don't think

00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:25,078
any of those kind of people
would be able

00:14:25,145 --> 00:14:27,114
to get in his suite.
Were you in his suite?

00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:30,484
The ex-wife isn't exactly
the best person to have around

00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,519
when you're looking
to get laid.

00:14:32,586 --> 00:14:34,655
Was that your
choice or his?

00:14:34,721 --> 00:14:36,623
It was mutual.

00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:39,092
I'm strictly
his manager now.

00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:41,528
So if you weren't
in his suite,
where did you go?

00:14:41,595 --> 00:14:43,330
I was taking care of business.

00:14:43,397 --> 00:14:45,666
( <i>chuckles</i> ):
Checked the boys in,

00:14:45,732 --> 00:14:47,701
made sure the suite
was copasetic,

00:14:47,768 --> 00:14:49,603
had a drink at Skin,

00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:55,208
and played pai gow until
hotel security came to get me.

00:14:55,275 --> 00:14:57,344
So how did <i>you</i> get
to be his manager?

00:14:57,411 --> 00:15:00,447
When I was with him,
he was broke.

00:15:00,514 --> 00:15:05,385
Then after the divorce,
I still... did his laundry,

00:15:05,452 --> 00:15:07,788
paid his bills,
read his scripts.

00:15:07,854 --> 00:15:10,624
After a while,
I wanted to get paid.

00:15:10,691 --> 00:15:13,026
Now I get ten percent
of everything.

00:15:14,695 --> 00:15:15,762
Look...

00:15:15,829 --> 00:15:18,031
I need to make some calls.

00:15:18,098 --> 00:15:19,933
Julian's parents, the studio...

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,969
Can we talk about this later?

00:15:22,035 --> 00:15:25,339
Sure. But I need your
prints and your DNA now.

00:15:27,374 --> 00:15:28,442
Tox shows low levels

00:15:28,508 --> 00:15:30,277
of cocaine,
alcohol and Prevalis.

00:15:30,344 --> 00:15:31,778
Rules out overdose.

00:15:31,845 --> 00:15:33,914
Really? I guess
he was just

00:15:33,981 --> 00:15:36,083
acting about the
clean-living part.

00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:37,150
C.O.D.?

00:15:37,217 --> 00:15:39,553
Asphyxia.
Asphyxiated how?

00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,554
I don't know.

00:15:40,621 --> 00:15:41,855
No broken hyoid.

00:15:41,922 --> 00:15:43,590
That and the absence of ligature

00:15:43,657 --> 00:15:46,426
marks or bruises
makes strangulation unlikely.

00:15:46,493 --> 00:15:48,762
Did you find any fibers
in his nose or mouth?

00:15:48,829 --> 00:15:49,930
Nope.

00:15:49,997 --> 00:15:51,298
That doesn't rule
out suffocation.

00:15:51,365 --> 00:15:52,599
Killer could
have used something

00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:53,600
that didn't
shed fibers.

00:15:53,667 --> 00:15:55,235
Or maybe they came from whoever

00:15:55,302 --> 00:15:57,170
he was rolling around with
in bed.

00:15:57,237 --> 00:15:59,906
Found, uh, lubricant
on his genitals,

00:15:59,973 --> 00:16:01,608
probably from a condom,

00:16:01,675 --> 00:16:04,177
and minor abrasions
on his penis,

00:16:04,244 --> 00:16:06,747
indicative of vigorous,
prolonged activity.

00:16:06,813 --> 00:16:10,183
Sex, drugs and movies:
the American dream.

00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,818
Mm-hmm.

00:16:22,396 --> 00:16:24,710
BROWN:
<i>Your stomach contents</i>
<i>contain alcohol</i>

00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,585
and traces of triazolam.

00:16:26,669 --> 00:16:27,669
Try-as-a-what?

00:16:27,752 --> 00:16:29,120
It's a sleeping pill,
has you reading

00:16:29,187 --> 00:16:30,155
the inside
of your eyelids

00:16:30,221 --> 00:16:32,157
for a week.
I didn't take any pills.

00:16:32,223 --> 00:16:33,925
We also found cocaine
in your bloodstream.

00:16:33,992 --> 00:16:35,694
I guess you didn't
take that, either?

00:16:38,129 --> 00:16:40,198
So I did a
couple of lines,

00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:42,000
but I didn't
take any pills.

00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:43,835
If I was gonna
take a pill,

00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:45,670
I would've popped
E or a perc.

00:16:45,737 --> 00:16:48,673
CURTIS:
Miss Villa, we found you
in Julian Harper's suite.

00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:49,941
Were you ever in his bedroom?

00:16:50,008 --> 00:16:52,143
( <i>exhales</i> ):
Who knows?

00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:55,213
I don't even know how
I ended up in Blinky's room.

00:16:56,514 --> 00:16:57,615
Oh, my...

00:16:57,682 --> 00:17:01,853
I swear, if that guy
slipped me something...

00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,355
Tell us what you do remember.

00:17:03,421 --> 00:17:04,956
( <i>exhales</i> )

00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,591
Um...

00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:11,930
Me and my girls
were at Skin, and, uh...

00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:15,600
Blinky came over and said he
was partying with Julian Harper.

00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:19,738
<i>And he said they had this</i>
<i>pimpy booth, so we went over.</i>

<i>It didn't turn out</i>
<i>the way I hoped.</i>

00:17:31,783 --> 00:17:34,719
And the next thing I know,
Blinky's on top of me.

00:17:34,786 --> 00:17:36,721
We could assist you
in reporting a date rape.

00:17:39,624 --> 00:17:41,359
Thanks, but no.

00:17:41,426 --> 00:17:43,194
It's not an offer, it's our job.

00:17:43,261 --> 00:17:46,097
There's this <i>Stuffmagazine</i>
party at Ghost Bar tonight.

00:17:46,164 --> 00:17:48,466
I'm not gonna make it harder
for me to get in

00:17:48,533 --> 00:17:51,503
because I tattled
on Julian Harper's best friend.

00:17:51,569 --> 00:17:54,039
I mean,
if I run into them tonight...

00:17:54,105 --> 00:17:55,974
Julian Harper will not be there.

00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,308
Trust me, he will.

00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:01,012
The coroner finished the autopsy
early this morning.

00:18:03,214 --> 00:18:04,783
He's dead?

00:18:04,849 --> 00:18:07,052
CURTIS:
Yeah.

00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,023
I was in Julian Harper's
suite when he died?

00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:15,160
You're kidding me, right?

00:18:15,226 --> 00:18:18,263
And being in his suite
makes you a suspect.

00:18:19,864 --> 00:18:21,599
I am?
Yes.

00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:25,470
So we're going to need to take
a sample of your DNA.

00:18:26,504 --> 00:18:28,606
Oh, man.

00:18:30,108 --> 00:18:34,312
I am <i>so</i> getting into that party
tonight for sure.

00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:39,384
MAN:
Yeah, I remember that guy.

00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,853
He's, like, Chinese
or something, real spun out.

00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,021
He was on meth?

00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:44,589
Well, he was
on something.

00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:46,324
He was acting
all shady.

00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:49,461
Downed a bottle of soda
before he even paid for it.

00:18:49,527 --> 00:18:51,963
And that's how you knew
he was on something?

00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,565
There ain't nothin' out here.

00:18:53,631 --> 00:18:56,735
People here <i>act</i> messed up
because they <i>are</i> messed up.

00:18:56,801 --> 00:18:58,803
The Metro Transit Board said
that he caught

00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:01,072
a Sunstar Taxi
from this address.

00:19:01,139 --> 00:19:02,273
I called it for him.

00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,242
Anything to get that tweaker
out of here.

00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,911
Any idea how he got here
in the first place?

00:19:06,978 --> 00:19:09,814
All I saw him do
was walk through the door.

00:19:09,881 --> 00:19:11,316
ROBBINS:
Samay Thao.

00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:14,853
I don't even need to open him up
to guess C.O.D.

00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:18,623
Ocular inflammation.

00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:23,194
Laceration of the sclera.

00:19:24,896 --> 00:19:26,398
Hurts like hell

00:19:26,464 --> 00:19:29,167
when you get a grain
of sand in your eye.

00:19:31,636 --> 00:19:35,273
Imagine this.

00:19:43,314 --> 00:19:44,649
Bad night for Laotians.

00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:46,951
What other Laotians
are having a bad night?

00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:52,190
ROBBINS:
Solo traffic collision
on Mount Charleston.

00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:53,458
Came in early
this morning.

00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:54,959
Noy Vipraxay.

00:19:56,227 --> 00:19:58,263
Vipraxay?

00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,298
Well, that's a hell
of a coincidence.

00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,033
Does it mean
something to you?

00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,803
Yeah, he's got the same
last name as the guy

00:20:04,869 --> 00:20:06,504
who shot <i>him.</i>
In fact,

00:20:06,571 --> 00:20:08,473
Grissom said that
our vic over there

00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,776
caught a cab at a gas station
near Mount Charleston.

00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:13,978
I'll have auto detail
bring in his car.

00:20:14,045 --> 00:20:16,381
Sounds like your double's
becoming a triple.

00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:18,717
Unless you got any more
in your drawers?

00:20:18,783 --> 00:20:19,851
Hey, Archie.

00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:21,986
See if you can
help me out.

00:20:22,053 --> 00:20:24,589
There was a smear on
the window at the hotel.

00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:25,857
It came back saliva.

00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:28,259
So I ran it through
CODIS, got a hit,

00:20:28,326 --> 00:20:31,796
felony battery on this
guy, Willie Angel.

00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:33,999
Now, he's a Las
Vegas resident,

00:20:34,065 --> 00:20:36,001
but he wasn't a registered guest
at the hotel.

00:20:36,067 --> 00:20:40,839
He has no affiliation
with Julian's little
entourage whatsoever.

00:20:40,905 --> 00:20:43,041
I think I scoped
this guy earlier.

00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:44,309
Really?
Yeah.

00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:46,177
Do it up.

00:20:49,447 --> 00:20:51,082
Yeah, there he is.

00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:52,217
Mm-hmm.

00:20:52,283 --> 00:20:54,486
( <i>chuckles</i> ):
Looking dapper.

00:20:54,552 --> 00:20:56,221
All right.

00:20:56,287 --> 00:20:58,990
12:31 a.m.

00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:01,226
Gets off
on the high-roller floor.

00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:11,469
Hey, 2:45 a.m.

00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:14,005
STOKES:
Shopping bags?

00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:16,675
There's no mall
on that floor.

00:21:16,741 --> 00:21:19,077
He was shopping
at Julian Harper's.

00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:20,845
Enough time to shop and kill.

00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:22,313
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,816
The Palms issued
two card keys--

00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:27,919
one to Julian, and one
to his boy Blinky.

00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:30,055
But the database shows...

00:21:30,121 --> 00:21:33,224
one, two...
three keys were used

00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:34,926
to access the suite?

00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:36,928
Well, assuming the third card
was Willie's.

00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:39,464
You can't just walk up
to the front desk

00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:42,701
and pull the "I lost my key"
scam on a VIP suite.

00:21:42,767 --> 00:21:44,936
So...

00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:47,172
how'd Willie get it?

00:21:50,141 --> 00:21:51,076
Hi.

00:21:51,142 --> 00:21:52,077
( <i>yawning</i> )

00:21:52,143 --> 00:21:53,611
Sorry.

00:21:53,678 --> 00:21:56,181
I just started seeing someone.
Had a bit of a late night.

00:21:57,749 --> 00:21:59,451
Let me ask you something.

00:21:59,517 --> 00:22:03,388
How do you know when it's gone
from just friends to more than?

00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:07,158
Well, if you have to ask...

00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:08,660
it's just friends.

00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:10,962
She is making dinner
for me this weekend.

00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:11,830
Are you the only guest?

00:22:11,896 --> 00:22:14,332
Do her roommates count?

00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:22,474
The splinter from your vic's eye
has four distinct layers.

00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:25,310
Polycarbonate plastic,
aluminum, acrylic and dye.

00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:27,746
Being an audiophile,
I prefer the sound of vinyl.

00:22:27,812 --> 00:22:30,048
It's from a compact disc?

00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:35,987
Well, how did it end up
in Samay Thao's eye?

00:22:38,056 --> 00:22:40,558
Noy Vipraxay's car.

00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,927
Easy for you to say.

00:22:42,994 --> 00:22:44,696
Find anything?

00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:46,564
Take a look at this.

00:22:46,631 --> 00:22:48,566
Gravitational pooling

00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:50,402
directly under
the steering wheel.

00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:59,678
WILLOWS:
<i>The car was found at the bottom</i>
of a steep incline.

00:22:59,744 --> 00:23:01,413
So he was leaning over it
when he bled out.

00:23:01,479 --> 00:23:03,481
Except he wasn't.

00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:06,484
Take a look. These were taken
at the crash site.

00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:09,087
If he'd have bled out
in the position he was found,

00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:10,455
there'd be blood on the door,

00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:12,290
not under
the steering wheel.

00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:17,195
So someone moved the body?

00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:20,832
There was plenty of mud
at the scene,

00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:23,468
and Samay had mud on his pants.

00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:27,038
Maybe we can match
soil samples.

00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:28,773
Hang on.

00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:35,647
Trace came back on the splinter
that was in Samay's eye.

00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:37,716
It was a CD fragment.

00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:42,454
Samay was in this car.

00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,055
SIDLE:
Hey, guys.

00:23:44,122 --> 00:23:47,292
I got work card hits off prints
from the two dead Laotians

00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:48,293
and the shooter.

00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,394
We already know their IDs.

00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:50,528
Well, did you already know

00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:51,930
that they all worked together?

00:23:57,902 --> 00:23:59,671
So Samay Thao
worked for you?

00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:01,139
Yeah, runs
the dryers.

00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:02,807
When was the last time
you saw him?

00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:05,143
He's been off
a couple days now.

00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:10,682
Did you know, uh,
Noy or Keo Vipraxay?

00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:12,517
Sure. They work here, too.

00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:14,319
They brothers
or cousins, or what?

00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:16,054
Brothers.
Keo's older.

00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:19,090
I hear they got six more
back in Laos.

00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:21,259
They work swing--
they're on at 4:00.

00:24:21,326 --> 00:24:23,461
Were they friends
of Samay's?

00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:25,997
No! No way.

00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:29,067
Keo and Noy are Lao Loum.

00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:30,402
They're lowlanders.

00:24:30,468 --> 00:24:32,103
Samay's Hmong;
he's in the hills.

00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:35,273
They're born to hate each other.
Some tribal crap.

00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,676
What kind of trouble
are they in?

00:24:37,742 --> 00:24:39,944
The kind where
you stop breathing.

00:24:40,011 --> 00:24:42,113
Noy's dead--
car accident.

00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,649
Samay's dead, too--
Keo shot him.

or a picture at most.

00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:23,247
And what I got was incredible.

00:31:24,248 --> 00:31:25,849
Go for it.

00:31:25,916 --> 00:31:27,751
You're the one he wants.

00:31:34,458 --> 00:31:37,127
It was like I was
in one of his movies.

00:31:38,996 --> 00:31:41,365
Until he kicked me
out of bed and...

00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:42,833
and then I get
off the elevator,

00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:45,269
and there's his manager
handing me a wad of money.

00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:49,373
I tip all the girls
Julian's with.

00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,276
So you're his pimp?

00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:54,545
It keeps them from
running their mouths.

00:31:54,612 --> 00:31:56,246
It protects Julian's image.

00:31:56,313 --> 00:31:58,482
It's just a part of
managing his career.

00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:00,584
I had sex with Julian
because I wanted to.

00:32:00,651 --> 00:32:03,053
But you took the money,

00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,922
and you bought
a purse with it.

00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:07,424
I had a conversation with
Julian's lawyer.

00:32:07,491 --> 00:32:10,361
And he said you weren't
only his ex-wife,

00:32:10,427 --> 00:32:12,696
you were about
to be his ex-manager.

00:32:12,763 --> 00:32:13,764
That piss you off?

00:32:13,831 --> 00:32:18,335
His lawyers and his agents
don't like me.

00:32:18,402 --> 00:32:20,671
They pressured him
to drop me.

00:32:20,738 --> 00:32:22,072
But Julian and I are family.

00:32:22,139 --> 00:32:23,440
That wasn't going to happen.

00:32:23,507 --> 00:32:28,712
Eva said if anyone asked,
Julian was a gentleman.

00:32:28,779 --> 00:32:32,750
Later he took me out and got me
a Katherine Baumann purse.

00:32:32,816 --> 00:32:36,420
It's a much better story to tell
my friends.

00:32:40,891 --> 00:32:44,128
GRISSOM:
<i>Samay and Noy go for a drive</i>
<i>after work.</i>

00:32:44,194 --> 00:32:46,130
<i>They stop at Mount Charleston.</i>

00:32:46,196 --> 00:32:50,301
( <i>speaking Lao</i> )

00:32:50,367 --> 00:32:52,102
<i>Samay kills Noy...</i>

00:32:52,169 --> 00:32:53,637
( <i>grunting and groaning</i> )

00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:00,511
<i>...and makes it look</i>
<i>like an accident.</i>

00:33:03,047 --> 00:33:05,249
And then he goes
to Keo's apartment

00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:06,684
and Keo shoots him,

00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:08,185
claiming self defense.

00:33:08,252 --> 00:33:09,386
I don't buy it.

00:33:09,453 --> 00:33:12,256
Keo shot him from
the other side of
a locked door.

00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:14,224
He was waiting to blow
the guy away.

00:33:14,291 --> 00:33:17,194
Which indicates that Keo
knew Samay was coming.

00:33:17,261 --> 00:33:19,330
Maybe he hired Samay
to kill his brother,

00:33:19,396 --> 00:33:21,532
and then he decided
to cut him out of the deal.

00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:24,134
Noy had a life
insurance policy

00:33:24,201 --> 00:33:27,171
issued through his union,
worth ten grand.

00:33:27,237 --> 00:33:28,439
Life's getting cheaper.

00:33:28,505 --> 00:33:29,573
Who's the beneficiary?

00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,476
Keo was the primary,
but check this out.

00:33:32,543 --> 00:33:35,112
Half the payout goes
to Joe Cavanaugh.

00:33:36,413 --> 00:33:38,082
( <i>speaking Lao</i> )

00:33:38,148 --> 00:33:40,784
He's not a court-approved
translator.

00:33:40,851 --> 00:33:42,686
That's why I taped it.

00:33:42,753 --> 00:33:44,788
I just didn't tell him.

00:33:44,855 --> 00:33:47,057
So far, he's saying

00:33:47,124 --> 00:33:49,627
what you asked him.

00:33:49,693 --> 00:33:51,629
"You must help me.

00:33:51,695 --> 00:33:54,765
"That's why I'm here.

00:33:54,832 --> 00:33:56,533
Just tell them what
they want to know."

00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,235
This is the part that's
different.

00:34:00,104 --> 00:34:02,873
"There are many things I can
tell him about you,

00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,042
"so you tell him this:

00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:07,544
"Samay came to my home.

00:34:07,611 --> 00:34:09,280
"I was afraid.

00:34:09,346 --> 00:34:10,714
"I thought he was there

00:34:10,781 --> 00:34:12,683
"to rob me or kill me.

00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:13,784
So I shot him."

00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:16,253
So our interpreter is hiding
something.

00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,756
Well, <i>that's</i> not lost in
translation.

00:34:26,001 --> 00:34:28,870
Mr. Cavanaugh, can you
come out here, please?

00:34:32,918 --> 00:34:34,486
We're going to have
a private chat.

00:34:34,553 --> 00:34:36,121
Let's go.

00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:47,502
In the interview,
remember Keo said,

00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:50,739
"There are many things
I can tell them about <i>you"?</i>

00:34:50,805 --> 00:34:53,108
You didn't tell me that.
You left that part out. Why?

00:34:53,175 --> 00:34:55,010
I told you what he said.

00:34:55,076 --> 00:34:57,512
You're not arresting
me because I screwed
up my translation?

00:34:57,579 --> 00:34:59,047
You're a co-beneficiary

00:34:59,114 --> 00:35:00,849
of Noy Vipraxay's
life insurance, right?

00:35:00,916 --> 00:35:02,050
So what?

00:35:02,117 --> 00:35:03,819
I help my guys try to
get a little security

00:35:03,885 --> 00:35:05,854
for their families.

00:35:05,921 --> 00:35:07,589
I help them in a lot of ways.

00:35:07,656 --> 00:35:10,210
Driver's licenses,
green cards...

00:35:10,293 --> 00:35:11,168
Oh, what, what?

00:35:11,168 --> 00:35:12,703
Out of the goodness
of your heart?

00:35:12,769 --> 00:35:14,071
Come on, they have
to come to you.

00:35:14,137 --> 00:35:15,072
Without me, they're back

00:35:15,138 --> 00:35:17,293
in a rice paddy
making three cents a day.

00:35:17,293 --> 00:35:19,918
Look, some of these guys
put me on their policy.

00:35:19,918 --> 00:35:21,168
It's their way of
saying "thank you."

00:35:21,168 --> 00:35:22,085
So when one
of your guys

00:35:22,085 --> 00:35:24,585
kills another one of your guys,
you make money out of it?

00:35:24,585 --> 00:35:26,487
We both know that
insurance companies

00:35:26,553 --> 00:35:28,022
don't even investigate claims
under ten grand.

00:35:28,088 --> 00:35:30,291
So you get a free pass.

00:35:30,357 --> 00:35:33,377
You don't really think I'd have
somebody killed for five grand?

00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,828
I've seen it done for
a lot less.

00:35:34,895 --> 00:35:37,097
That don't
mean I did it.

00:35:37,164 --> 00:35:40,034
There's new casinos
that open all the time.

00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:42,436
They all got laundries.

00:35:42,503 --> 00:35:45,205
I bring home 15 G's
a month on the side.

00:35:45,272 --> 00:35:49,810
So I am not going to bend over
a dollar to pick up a dime.

00:35:50,876 --> 00:35:52,513
Hodges, do you have
the results

00:35:52,579 --> 00:35:54,181
on the fibers

00:35:54,248 --> 00:35:56,150
that we dropped off to...?

00:36:00,187 --> 00:36:01,321
Hodges?

00:36:02,923 --> 00:36:03,924
He's asleep.

00:36:08,696 --> 00:36:11,799
( <i>shouting</i> ):
Let me guess,

00:36:11,865 --> 00:36:13,000
the fibers are wool.

00:36:14,034 --> 00:36:15,636
Are you bagging Z's
right now, man?

00:36:15,703 --> 00:36:17,004
I was just having
the greatest dream.

00:36:17,071 --> 00:36:18,072
You were out.

00:36:18,138 --> 00:36:20,541
It was the '80s and I had
this Don Johnson beard,

00:36:20,607 --> 00:36:21,975
you know,
the <i>Miami Vice</i> stubble.

00:36:22,042 --> 00:36:24,378
It just gave me this
air of danger.

00:36:24,445 --> 00:36:25,846
My lady loved it.

00:36:27,381 --> 00:36:32,152
Um, I found two types of
fibers on your guy's chin.

00:36:32,219 --> 00:36:34,321
Cotton and
a polyester-
lycra blend.

00:36:34,388 --> 00:36:35,689
Both dyed black.

00:36:37,558 --> 00:36:39,326
Dyed black?

00:36:39,393 --> 00:36:41,395
The bedding might
have been cotton,

00:36:41,462 --> 00:36:42,663
but it wasn't black.

00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:43,964
The comforter
and draperies

00:36:44,031 --> 00:36:46,667
may have been poly, but they
weren't black, either.

00:36:46,734 --> 00:36:49,770
I bagged some black socks
and some black pantyhose.

00:36:51,138 --> 00:36:53,741
This could be the source of
the fibers.

00:36:53,807 --> 00:36:56,343
He wasn't suffocated
with his crew sock.

00:37:00,881 --> 00:37:03,450
Did you notice the burn mark
on the knot in these pantyhose

00:37:03,517 --> 00:37:06,086
at the crime scene?

00:37:06,153 --> 00:37:09,757
No. No, they were
all balled up.

00:37:09,823 --> 00:37:12,259
I just bagged them
and tagged them.

00:37:12,326 --> 00:37:14,762
Oh, yeah.

00:37:14,828 --> 00:37:17,464
Yeah, we've got
to get this to DNA.

00:37:20,501 --> 00:37:22,136
STOKES:
I thought Greg was
in the field.

00:37:22,202 --> 00:37:23,704
Is he back
in the lab?
I don't know.

00:37:23,771 --> 00:37:26,073
We've got to clear this up.
It's like he's confused.

00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:28,275
Lab, field, field, lab.
We have a lab on wheels.

00:37:28,342 --> 00:37:30,944
How about you guys
just shut up, all right?

00:37:31,011 --> 00:37:33,414
I'm doing this as
a favor for Ecklie.

00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,315
It's a one-time thing.

00:37:35,382 --> 00:37:36,784
He's still interviewing
lab techs.

00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:37,851
You making overtime?

00:37:37,918 --> 00:37:39,386
I'm taking one
for the team.

00:37:39,453 --> 00:37:40,387
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

00:37:40,454 --> 00:37:41,622
Tell me about
these pantyhose.

00:37:41,689 --> 00:37:45,292
Well, I found Tally's
epithelials on the inside,

00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:48,295
which is no surprise,
since she was wearing them.

00:37:48,362 --> 00:37:51,532
I also found black cotton fibers
on the outside--

00:37:51,598 --> 00:37:53,734
highest concentration
near the crotch.

00:37:53,801 --> 00:37:55,436
Insert joke here.

00:37:55,502 --> 00:37:57,471
The vic had a pair of
black cotton socks.

00:37:57,538 --> 00:38:01,141
Well, I did find black cotton
fibers under his chin.

00:38:01,208 --> 00:38:06,280
Okay, transfer from the sock
to the pantyhose, to the neck.

00:38:06,346 --> 00:38:09,249
So the sock was in between
the pantyhose and the neck?

00:38:09,316 --> 00:38:11,051
Padding.

00:38:11,118 --> 00:38:13,454
BCP, Breath Control Play.

00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,689
<i>Couples increase</i>
<i>their partner's pleasure</i>

00:38:15,756 --> 00:38:16,890
<i>through strangulation.</i>

00:38:16,957 --> 00:38:18,926
And if you're not careful,
it leaves marks.

00:38:18,992 --> 00:38:20,694
Yeah, this guy Julian Harper's
an actor,

00:38:20,761 --> 00:38:22,896
so I'm sure he didn't want
bruises on his neck

00:38:22,963 --> 00:38:24,264
to be showing on camera.

00:38:24,331 --> 00:38:26,667
There were only two girls
in the suite.

00:38:26,734 --> 00:38:28,268
Which one of them killed him?

00:38:28,335 --> 00:38:30,838
Burnt pantyhose.

00:38:30,904 --> 00:38:34,641
Okay, evidence
of sex games
gone wrong.

00:38:34,708 --> 00:38:37,077
I don't see how we could
have missed anything.

00:38:37,144 --> 00:38:38,746
There's no fireplace here.

00:38:38,812 --> 00:38:41,548
I haven't seen
any lighters.

00:38:41,615 --> 00:38:43,851
Well, something singed the hose.

00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:03,604
Hey.

00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:04,605
Hmm?

00:39:04,671 --> 00:39:07,207
There's some burnt residue
on this lamp.

00:39:11,311 --> 00:39:13,580
You know what I think?

00:39:13,647 --> 00:39:17,351
I think someone tied him up,

00:39:17,418 --> 00:39:19,620
and they couldn't get the knot
undone, because it melted.

00:39:19,686 --> 00:39:22,289
So they panicked.

00:39:22,356 --> 00:39:24,825
And they pulled the hose down.

00:39:24,892 --> 00:39:27,961
STOKES:
I'll print the light.

00:39:28,028 --> 00:39:31,899
I guess even having
an unlimited supply
of hot women

00:39:31,965 --> 00:39:33,400
is not enough, huh?

00:39:33,467 --> 00:39:36,336
Bondage sex with
your best friend?

00:39:36,403 --> 00:39:39,506
It's cool,
you guys were
on the down low.

00:39:39,573 --> 00:39:40,974
I don't understand.

00:39:41,041 --> 00:39:42,509
Well, we found both your prints

00:39:42,576 --> 00:39:44,344
and Julian's prints
on a light fixture

00:39:44,411 --> 00:39:46,547
above the bed.

00:39:46,613 --> 00:39:48,215
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:39:48,282 --> 00:39:49,717
We were not down like that.

00:39:49,783 --> 00:39:51,552
Rise and shine, buddy!

00:39:51,618 --> 00:39:52,720
Room service.

00:39:55,689 --> 00:39:57,691
Dude, Julian?

00:40:04,431 --> 00:40:06,033
( <i>grunts</i> )

00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,235
BLINKY:
<i>He did it to himself, man.</i>

00:40:08,302 --> 00:40:10,604
<i>He did it to himself.</i>

00:40:10,671 --> 00:40:14,408
<i>I took the pantyhose,</i>
<i>and I took them off the light.</i>

00:40:14,475 --> 00:40:16,910
And then I put his boxers
back on.

00:40:19,113 --> 00:40:22,449
I wasn't going to let his mom
open up <i>Us</i> magazine

00:40:22,516 --> 00:40:25,853
and see her boy like that.

00:40:25,919 --> 00:40:29,656
Jules, he always did me right.

00:40:29,723 --> 00:40:32,760
Now I just wanted
to do him the same.

00:40:34,962 --> 00:40:38,098
I got the serial number
run down from Keo's shotgun.

00:40:38,165 --> 00:40:42,569
He bought it last week,
two days before he shot Samay.

00:40:42,636 --> 00:40:43,971
The guy's barely
scraping by,

00:40:44,038 --> 00:40:47,274
and he spends $250
on a brand-new Mossberg?

00:40:47,341 --> 00:40:48,976
There's a word for that.

00:40:49,043 --> 00:40:50,577
"Premeditation."

00:40:50,644 --> 00:40:52,746
Your brother gets killed.
You killed the guy who did it

00:40:52,813 --> 00:40:53,981
with a shotgun
you just bought.

00:40:54,048 --> 00:40:55,549
And end up

00:40:55,616 --> 00:40:56,717
$5,000 ahead.

00:40:56,784 --> 00:40:58,252
( <i>speaking Lao</i> )

00:41:02,056 --> 00:41:04,458
In Nevada, that's murder one.

00:41:04,525 --> 00:41:07,327
20 years to life.

00:41:07,394 --> 00:41:09,196
Unless you get
the death sentence.

00:41:09,263 --> 00:41:11,165
( <i>speaking Lao</i> )

00:41:11,231 --> 00:41:14,001
What are my
client's options?

00:41:14,068 --> 00:41:15,769
A full confession.

00:41:15,836 --> 00:41:17,771
We make a recommendation
to the DA,

00:41:17,838 --> 00:41:19,006
maybe he gets
murder two.

00:41:19,073 --> 00:41:21,475
( <i>speaking Lao</i> )

00:41:25,179 --> 00:41:27,948
I brought Noy here to help me.

00:41:28,015 --> 00:41:29,516
What?

00:41:29,583 --> 00:41:31,785
To work hard and save.

00:41:31,852 --> 00:41:35,489
To bring our family here.

00:41:35,556 --> 00:41:37,891
Our parent.

00:41:37,958 --> 00:41:39,560
Our sister.

00:41:39,626 --> 00:41:42,196
My wife.

00:41:42,262 --> 00:41:44,398
Instead he waste the money.

00:41:44,465 --> 00:41:47,201
On the DVD,

00:41:47,267 --> 00:41:50,237
gambling, clothes.

00:41:52,606 --> 00:41:56,810
Noy's life was worthless.

00:41:56,877 --> 00:42:00,714
His death is not.

00:42:07,287 --> 00:42:09,490
( <i>knocking</i> )

00:42:09,556 --> 00:42:11,692
Griss, we closed
that actor case.

00:42:11,759 --> 00:42:13,861
And?

00:42:13,927 --> 00:42:16,697
Accidental death as a result
of auto-erotic asphyxiation.

00:42:16,764 --> 00:42:20,567
Strangled himself to death
to enhance his own pleasure.

00:42:22,269 --> 00:42:25,072
It was in the days
of public hangings

00:42:25,139 --> 00:42:27,241
that people first noticed
that men would get erections

00:42:27,307 --> 00:42:29,743
and sometimes
even ejaculate.

00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:33,714
They called it
"the killer orgasm."

00:42:33,781 --> 00:42:35,949
It's a waste.

00:42:36,016 --> 00:42:38,218
Guy had everything--
money, fame...

00:42:38,285 --> 00:42:41,388
Yeah, look where <i>he</i> ended up.
