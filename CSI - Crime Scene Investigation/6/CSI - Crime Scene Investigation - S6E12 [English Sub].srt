( <i>moans quietly</i> )

00:00:46,284 --> 00:00:47,719
Hey, lady.

00:00:47,786 --> 00:00:49,354
Hey.

00:00:49,421 --> 00:00:53,491
I can't sleep.

00:00:53,558 --> 00:00:55,894
You want to try
to eat something?

00:00:55,961 --> 00:00:57,462
Yeah.

00:01:02,334 --> 00:01:03,335
All right.

00:01:03,401 --> 00:01:05,003
I'll go get him.

00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:06,571
You get dressed.

00:01:08,707 --> 00:01:10,175
Ahren?

00:01:13,311 --> 00:01:14,579
Ahren?

00:01:17,249 --> 00:01:18,483
Ahren?

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,655
Ahren...

00:01:23,722 --> 00:01:24,823
( <i>gasps</i> )

00:01:26,958 --> 00:01:28,994
( <i>whispering</i> ):
Ahren...

00:01:30,795 --> 00:01:32,964
Ahren...

00:01:33,031 --> 00:01:37,102
BRASS:
Okay, Ahren Green,
29 years old,

00:01:37,168 --> 00:01:39,938
lives here with Bianca Desmond,
that's the brunette.

00:01:40,005 --> 00:01:42,707
The blonde is
Chelsea Wannamaker.

00:01:42,774 --> 00:01:44,809
She was just
spending the night.

00:01:44,876 --> 00:01:46,778
One was asleep,
one was in the bathroom.

00:01:46,845 --> 00:01:48,446
They said Ahren was probably
working on his bike.

00:01:48,513 --> 00:01:51,049
( <i>camera shutter clicking</i> )

00:01:51,116 --> 00:01:52,584
PHILLIPS:
His pupils are dilated.

00:01:52,651 --> 00:01:54,619
Lividity is consistent
with body position.

00:01:54,686 --> 00:01:57,422
Looks like he bled out
from a stab wound

00:01:57,489 --> 00:01:59,491
to his upper leg
or pelvic area.

00:01:59,558 --> 00:02:01,026
Well, in my experience,

00:02:01,092 --> 00:02:03,929
I found that most threesomes
end up being one too many.

00:02:03,995 --> 00:02:06,331
So, David, uh...

00:02:06,398 --> 00:02:07,465
check and make sure

00:02:07,532 --> 00:02:09,000
that they didn't
pull a Lorena Bobbitt.

00:02:10,001 --> 00:02:11,770
Take a look.

00:02:19,678 --> 00:02:20,612
No, we're good.

00:02:20,679 --> 00:02:21,680
My man's all there.

00:02:21,746 --> 00:02:23,248
We're...good.

00:02:23,315 --> 00:02:24,616
Something must
be wrong his gear.

00:02:24,683 --> 00:02:26,451
He could be partying
with two hot chicks inside,

00:02:26,518 --> 00:02:27,919
but he's out here
working on his bike

00:02:27,986 --> 00:02:29,454
at 4:00 in the morning?

00:02:29,521 --> 00:02:31,523
Maybe he wasn't invited.

And the other side.

00:03:17,723 --> 00:03:20,593
What were you doing
right before Ahren was killed?

00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,562
Cleaning.

00:03:23,629 --> 00:03:24,931
With what?

00:03:24,997 --> 00:03:26,399
Bleach.

00:03:26,465 --> 00:03:28,134
It's the only thing that works.

00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,268
Okay.

00:03:29,335 --> 00:03:30,836
You know, you could put
some clothes on if you want,

00:03:30,903 --> 00:03:32,138
if you're cold.

00:03:32,204 --> 00:03:34,974
She won't let me
back in my room.

00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:37,310
( <i>camera clicking</i> )

00:04:08,174 --> 00:04:10,009
Man, I give this guy
an "A" for organization.

00:04:10,076 --> 00:04:13,279
He's got a spot for everything.

00:04:13,346 --> 00:04:14,981
Why is that helmet over there?

00:04:15,047 --> 00:04:16,849
GRISSOM:
Maybe he threw it,

00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:18,718
defending himself.

00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,692
( <i>screaming</i> )

00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:28,461
Yeah, but he looked like
he was in pretty good shape.

00:04:28,527 --> 00:04:30,363
It'd be kind of hard
for one of those women

00:04:30,429 --> 00:04:31,931
to wrestle him
down.

00:04:31,998 --> 00:04:34,834
Not if she walks softly
and carried a big knife.

00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,636
How long
have you known Ahren?

00:04:36,702 --> 00:04:38,938
Six months.

00:04:39,005 --> 00:04:42,842
Did, uh, did he have any enemies
that you know of?

00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:46,479
No, I mean...
I don't know.

00:04:46,545 --> 00:04:47,680
You don't know...

00:04:47,747 --> 00:04:48,881
I mean, you two
lived together right?

00:04:48,948 --> 00:04:51,984
Yeah, but we were still getting
to know each other.

00:04:52,051 --> 00:04:52,985
I see.

00:04:53,052 --> 00:04:54,287
We met one night
at Light.

00:04:54,353 --> 00:04:58,257
He was in town
for a motocross race.

00:04:58,324 --> 00:05:00,726
It was love
at first sight.

00:05:00,793 --> 00:05:02,495
I asked him
to come back here,

00:05:02,561 --> 00:05:06,065
and he never left.

00:05:06,132 --> 00:05:11,070
We actually just decided tonight
to move to Colorado together.

00:05:11,137 --> 00:05:12,905
What, just pick up
and leave all this?

00:05:12,972 --> 00:05:16,475
My father has a cabin
where we could stay.

00:05:16,542 --> 00:05:17,810
Did Ahren have a job?

00:05:17,877 --> 00:05:19,979
Yeah. Motocross racing.
Right.

00:05:20,046 --> 00:05:21,180
You said that.

00:05:21,247 --> 00:05:22,214
He's a professional athlete.

00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:24,016
And you, what about you?
What do you do?

00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:25,451
I'm in fashion.

00:05:25,518 --> 00:05:27,954
Mm-hm.

00:05:29,388 --> 00:05:30,756
What's the matter?

00:05:33,526 --> 00:05:35,528
I have the worst luck with men.

00:05:35,595 --> 00:05:38,631
What do you mean?

00:05:38,698 --> 00:05:42,668
They're either jerks
or they leave me,

00:05:42,735 --> 00:05:44,704
or they get killed.

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,709
What's wrong with me?

00:05:53,245 --> 00:05:55,147
What do you got?

00:05:55,214 --> 00:05:57,683
Well, I wasn't sure
if I should call it in

00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,585
as a 419 or a 401A.

00:05:59,652 --> 00:06:01,187
Hit and run?

00:06:01,253 --> 00:06:03,756
You tell me.

00:06:03,823 --> 00:06:06,525
STOKES:
Mm, I don't know.

00:06:06,592 --> 00:06:08,961
When you run, you
usually take the car.

00:06:09,028 --> 00:06:10,863
The vic's Sylvia Mullins.

00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:12,732
Works in one of
the offices upstairs.

00:06:12,798 --> 00:06:14,033
The security guard

00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,234
found her.

00:06:15,301 --> 00:06:17,203
Did you run the plates?

00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,938
That's why I went with the 419.

00:06:19,005 --> 00:06:20,273
R.O.'s the vic.

00:06:27,313 --> 00:06:31,384
Hit with her own car
in her own spot.

00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:34,320
Ms. Mullins must have been
working all night.

00:06:34,387 --> 00:06:35,421
You know, tax season.

00:06:35,488 --> 00:06:36,756
She's an accountant?

00:06:36,822 --> 00:06:39,959
Has her own firm
up on 11.

00:06:40,026 --> 00:06:43,129
Did you see anything
on your monitors?

00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:47,066
Uh, no.

00:06:47,133 --> 00:06:48,901
But I heard
the crash.

00:06:48,968 --> 00:06:50,903
I sort of fell asleep.

00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:53,306
We're going to need
to see your tapes.

00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:58,210
WILLOWS:
Cell phone, a shoe
and a briefcase.

00:06:58,277 --> 00:07:00,780
Probably lost them
all on impact.

00:07:00,846 --> 00:07:02,081
STOKES:
Looks like she saw
the car coming.

00:07:02,148 --> 00:07:05,818
Impact's pretty
evenly distributed.

00:07:05,885 --> 00:07:07,119
The car hit her
straight on.

00:07:07,186 --> 00:07:08,788
Most cars have to be going

00:07:08,854 --> 00:07:11,023
at least 14 miles an hour
to trigger the airbag.

00:07:15,895 --> 00:07:17,129
Well, I can't be sure,

00:07:17,196 --> 00:07:19,065
but it looks like somebody
popped the ignition.

00:07:21,067 --> 00:07:22,435
Carjacking gone bad?

00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:28,674
Vic gets off the elevator,
walks to her spot...

00:07:30,576 --> 00:07:32,678
<i>...on the phone, distracted,</i>

00:07:32,745 --> 00:07:34,981
<i>catches the guy</i>
<i>stealing her ride...</i>

00:07:47,893 --> 00:07:50,630
He runs her over and splits.

00:07:50,696 --> 00:07:52,732
Pedal to the metal.

00:07:59,338 --> 00:08:01,040
Hey.

00:08:01,107 --> 00:08:03,242
ALS is lighting up
everywhere.

00:08:03,309 --> 00:08:05,478
Evidently she bleaches
everything.

00:08:05,544 --> 00:08:07,880
So there could be
some false positives.

00:08:07,947 --> 00:08:11,050
Yeah, including her teeth.

00:08:11,117 --> 00:08:12,451
Check out
the cabinet.

00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:19,025
SIDLE:
Lots of teeth whitener
and acne cream.

00:08:19,091 --> 00:08:21,060
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

00:08:21,127 --> 00:08:22,428
Speed freak.

00:08:22,495 --> 00:08:23,996
Definitely.

00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:27,099
Maybe she killed
Ahren in the garage

00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:29,435
then came up here to
take a Silkwood shower.

00:08:35,775 --> 00:08:41,147
Okay, but she's claiming
she loved him.

00:08:41,213 --> 00:08:42,448
What's her motive?

00:08:42,515 --> 00:08:48,554
Uh, we started out at Light
and then we went to Road Runner,

00:08:48,621 --> 00:08:52,458
and from there we were
at Double Down,

00:08:52,525 --> 00:08:56,028
and then Copper K,
and then we ended
up at Drai's.

00:08:56,095 --> 00:08:58,064
Drai's, that's
a good place to end.

00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:00,399
So what are you on
besides meth?

00:09:02,401 --> 00:09:04,637
Not meth.

00:09:04,704 --> 00:09:05,738
Glass.

00:09:05,805 --> 00:09:07,940
Uh-huh.

00:09:08,007 --> 00:09:10,042
We did some coke
at the club,

00:09:10,109 --> 00:09:11,711
had a couple of drinks.

00:09:11,777 --> 00:09:14,880
There was this guy
that gave us these, uh,
these blue pills,

00:09:14,947 --> 00:09:17,750
but I had to come
home and lie down.

00:09:17,817 --> 00:09:18,918
Ecstasy.

00:09:18,985 --> 00:09:20,786
We only do this when we're,
when we're clubbing.

00:09:20,853 --> 00:09:24,924
I mean, it's just a hobby,
it's not a habit.

00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,092
We have it
under control.

00:09:26,158 --> 00:09:28,828
Well, the dead guy
from the garage

00:09:28,894 --> 00:09:30,263
might beg to differ.

00:09:35,067 --> 00:09:37,270
Eww, busy.

00:09:37,336 --> 00:09:42,742
If Bianca killed him, and then
came up here to take a shower,

00:09:42,808 --> 00:09:44,143
wouldn't she have left a trail?

00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:46,479
Maybe.

00:10:05,965 --> 00:10:07,800
It appears she missed a spot.

00:10:39,732 --> 00:10:42,034
( <i>gunshot</i> )

00:10:45,338 --> 00:10:48,007
( <i>soft rattling</i> )

00:11:00,886 --> 00:11:02,088
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

00:11:08,661 --> 00:11:10,029
Las Vegas Coroner's Office.

00:11:10,096 --> 00:11:11,697
David, it's Warrick.
Have you washed the body yet?

00:11:11,764 --> 00:11:12,932
I just got started,

00:11:12,999 --> 00:11:14,433
but I can be done by the time
you get here.

00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,668
No, stop.

00:11:15,735 --> 00:11:18,170
I uh, just found a bullet.

00:11:18,237 --> 00:11:19,772
I have no idea who fired it.

00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,508
Do me a favor:
test his hands for GSR

00:11:22,575 --> 00:11:25,077
and run it through
the flouroscope.

00:11:25,144 --> 00:11:26,212
No problem.

00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:29,515
Thanks, David.

00:11:29,582 --> 00:11:32,551
Who brings a gun
to a knife fight?

00:11:34,153 --> 00:11:36,389
The winner?

00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:39,827
The killer knew how
to steal a car.

00:11:39,893 --> 00:11:40,828
No prints?
No.

00:11:40,894 --> 00:11:43,230
No, it's wiped clean.

00:11:43,297 --> 00:11:44,431
Hey, Arch.

00:11:44,498 --> 00:11:46,967
You get anything off
the parking garage camera?

00:11:47,034 --> 00:11:49,837
Um, sort of.

00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:53,701
STOKES:
What's up
with the focus?

00:11:53,768 --> 00:11:54,935
That's what I was wondering,
too.

00:11:55,002 --> 00:11:58,239
Check out what happened
about an hour earlier.

00:12:01,976 --> 00:12:03,277
It's an old security cam.

00:12:03,344 --> 00:12:04,678
Adjustable focus ring.

00:12:04,745 --> 00:12:06,280
Killer was camera shy.

00:12:06,347 --> 00:12:07,515
For good reason.

00:12:07,581 --> 00:12:09,350
This wasn't a carjacking
gone bad.

00:12:09,417 --> 00:12:10,584
It was premeditated.

00:12:10,651 --> 00:12:11,886
If he touched the camera,

00:12:11,952 --> 00:12:14,088
maybe I can get some prints
off it.

00:12:14,155 --> 00:12:15,656
Keep working
the video, Arch.

00:12:15,723 --> 00:12:17,625
See if you can get
us a face.
Yeah.

00:12:17,691 --> 00:12:20,127
ROBBINS:
Fluoroscope detected
no bullets.

00:12:20,194 --> 00:12:22,696
But there are peri-mortem
bruises on his wrists

00:12:22,763 --> 00:12:25,733
and forearms,
look like defensive wounds.

00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,867
C.O.D.?

00:12:26,934 --> 00:12:29,437
The weapon went pretty deep.
Punctured the femoral artery.

00:12:29,503 --> 00:12:32,373
I'd say he bled out
in a matter of minutes,

00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,608
if his dilated pupils
are an indication

00:12:34,675 --> 00:12:35,976
of amphetamines
in his system.

00:12:36,043 --> 00:12:37,945
The faster the heart rate,
the faster the blood pumps.

00:12:38,012 --> 00:12:39,947
Here, take a look.

00:12:40,014 --> 00:12:42,316
The fatal blow.

00:12:42,383 --> 00:12:45,019
Weapon appears to have
a triangular shape.

00:12:45,086 --> 00:12:47,788
Angle of entry
was upwards.

00:12:47,855 --> 00:12:50,257
Like a cornada.
I'm sorry.

00:12:50,324 --> 00:12:54,995
A cornada-- occupational
hazard for matadors
during a bullfight.

00:12:55,062 --> 00:12:56,764
The bull rears up
and gores them.

00:12:56,831 --> 00:12:58,766
So just find a bull
with a bloody horn,

00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:00,201
and you've got
your killer.

00:13:02,336 --> 00:13:06,507
So your "soda-can killer"
was a copper-washed .22.

00:13:06,574 --> 00:13:08,576
Now I could only get general
rifling characteristics--

00:13:08,642 --> 00:13:10,544
six lands and grooves

00:13:10,611 --> 00:13:13,147
with a right-hand twist,
um, but...

00:13:13,214 --> 00:13:14,715
But not enough individual
characteristics

00:13:14,782 --> 00:13:16,050
to run it through IBIS.

00:13:16,117 --> 00:13:17,418
Exactly. Sorry, man.

00:13:17,485 --> 00:13:19,487
That's all right.

00:13:19,553 --> 00:13:22,022
Hodges.

00:13:22,089 --> 00:13:25,626
Your victim did not have
GSR on his hands.

00:13:25,693 --> 00:13:28,295
Okay, what about
metallic trace

00:13:28,362 --> 00:13:29,430
from the garage floor?

00:13:29,497 --> 00:13:31,132
Thank you, Hodges,
for performing

00:13:31,198 --> 00:13:32,900
that incredibly
elaborate test

00:13:32,967 --> 00:13:36,203
requiring copious concentration
and an advanced degree.

00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:37,671
So you don't have
any results

00:13:37,738 --> 00:13:40,341
from the metallic trace
on the garage floor?

00:13:40,408 --> 00:13:42,777
But I will.

00:13:42,843 --> 00:13:45,012
That's the beauty of me.

00:14:16,077 --> 00:14:18,379
MULLINS:
Well, Mr. Miller, what
I would recommend

00:14:18,446 --> 00:14:20,014
is adding some tax-deferred
investments

00:14:20,081 --> 00:14:21,215
to your portfolio.

00:14:21,282 --> 00:14:23,017
Like a ROTH IRA.
That's be perfect for you.

00:14:23,084 --> 00:14:25,252
MILLER:
I never got what that
ROTH stood for.

Hey, Kelly. Have a seat.

00:14:58,319 --> 00:14:59,653
GORDON:
Thanks for seeing me.

00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,156
I know you said we didn't have
to do this in person.

00:15:02,223 --> 00:15:03,624
No, I'm really glad you came.

00:15:03,691 --> 00:15:05,292
Kelly, your father loved
you very much.

00:15:05,359 --> 00:15:07,161
A little too much.

00:15:07,228 --> 00:15:09,430
I just wanted to talk
about his estate.

00:15:09,497 --> 00:15:11,532
Is what he did
going to affect it?

00:15:11,599 --> 00:15:12,700
Well, it's kind
of complicated.

WOMAN:
District Four,
Parole and Probation.

00:15:27,415 --> 00:15:29,950
Yeah, this is Nick Stokes
with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.

00:15:30,017 --> 00:15:32,486
We're trying to reach
Kelly Gordon's parole officer.

00:15:32,553 --> 00:15:34,622
That's me.

00:15:34,688 --> 00:15:37,892
Great. I need Kelly's
contact information.

00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:40,361
Sure, but I gave her permission
to go out of town.

00:15:40,428 --> 00:15:42,997
Her bus left a couple
hours ago.

00:15:45,499 --> 00:15:47,201
Oh, hey, I'm glad
you're here.

00:15:47,268 --> 00:15:49,570
I got the results back
from the blood on
Bianca's bedroom floor.

00:15:49,637 --> 00:15:51,772
The dead guy?
Uh, no.

00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,875
It's a male, but it's not
a match to Ahren Green.

00:15:54,942 --> 00:15:56,644
Then I ran it through CODIS

00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:58,412
and I actually got a hit.

00:15:58,479 --> 00:16:00,414
Justin Cole.

00:16:00,481 --> 00:16:02,616
He's in the system
for statutory rape

00:16:02,683 --> 00:16:04,185
a couple years back.

00:16:04,251 --> 00:16:05,653
Among other things.

00:16:09,857 --> 00:16:11,525
So, why am I here?

00:16:11,592 --> 00:16:13,761
What, you getting homesick
for the train tracks

00:16:13,828 --> 00:16:16,464
behind Union Plaza already?

00:16:18,432 --> 00:16:20,835
Bianca Desmond.

00:16:20,901 --> 00:16:23,804
Girl's like an oven in there.

00:16:23,871 --> 00:16:26,474
Used to love it in there.

00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:29,777
How long ago was that?

00:16:29,844 --> 00:16:32,546
A few months.

00:16:32,613 --> 00:16:36,617
Did you stop by recently
to check out the competition?

00:16:36,684 --> 00:16:39,720
No. We lost touch.

00:16:39,787 --> 00:16:41,789
So it wouldn't bother you
to know Bianca's moved on,

00:16:41,856 --> 00:16:43,858
and she's living
with another guy.

00:16:43,924 --> 00:16:45,559
It was good while it lasted.

00:16:45,626 --> 00:16:47,995
We found your blood
in her bedroom.

00:16:48,062 --> 00:16:49,830
And her dead boyfriend
in the garage.

00:16:49,897 --> 00:16:52,867
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:16:57,738 --> 00:16:59,974
That's funny?

00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,443
Nah.

00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:04,779
Just... Bianca's all
fun and games

00:17:04,845 --> 00:17:06,347
until someone
shoots you in the leg.

00:17:06,414 --> 00:17:07,848
When was that?

00:17:07,915 --> 00:17:10,551
Six months ago.

00:17:12,853 --> 00:17:15,890
BIANCA:
Hey, sweetie, I went shopping
with my mom.

00:17:15,956 --> 00:17:17,124
I'll be home late.

00:17:17,191 --> 00:17:19,293
There's some candy for you
on the table.

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,861
See you then. Love you.

MAN:
Stay away
from Bianca.

00:17:29,937 --> 00:17:32,740
So I packed my stuff and left.

00:17:32,807 --> 00:17:33,974
Did you report it?

00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:37,878
Nah. Still on probation for
that "she-looked-18" incident.

00:17:37,945 --> 00:17:39,747
This the guy who shot you?

00:17:40,981 --> 00:17:43,784
Didn't really get a good look.

00:17:43,851 --> 00:17:44,985
I was too busy bleeding.

00:17:45,052 --> 00:17:46,353
You go to the hospital?

00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:49,356
Sort of had my own
anesthesia thing going on.

00:17:49,423 --> 00:17:51,926
So whatever happened
to the bullet?

00:18:09,143 --> 00:18:14,515
Yeah, see, human tissue
sticks pretty darn good.

00:18:14,582 --> 00:18:16,117
And I can't
scalpel it off,

00:18:16,183 --> 00:18:18,686
because I might damage
the bullet's characteristics.

00:18:18,753 --> 00:18:21,789
So, uh... so I guess we wait.

00:18:21,856 --> 00:18:24,558

Half of these tools don't match

00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:26,727
the size and the shape
of the wound.

00:18:26,794 --> 00:18:29,230
And the ones that do,
don't have blood on them.

00:18:29,296 --> 00:18:31,399
The killer could
have wiped it off.

00:18:31,465 --> 00:18:33,667
I don't see why the killer would
have used a tool anyway,

00:18:33,734 --> 00:18:34,735
when he had a gun.

00:18:34,802 --> 00:18:36,904
Maybe Ahern disarmed him

00:18:36,971 --> 00:18:38,906
and he grabbed
whatever was handy.

00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,148
Take a look at this.

00:18:47,214 --> 00:18:49,550

Except for this.

It's got no space
in the pegboard

00:18:55,456 --> 00:18:57,224
and it doesn't match
any of the sets.

And you think I have

When you worked
in the prison garage,

00:21:43,824 --> 00:21:45,526
did you just learn how
to fix cars

00:21:45,593 --> 00:21:47,461
or did you learn
how to steal them?

00:21:47,528 --> 00:21:48,829
Are you kidding me?

00:21:48,896 --> 00:21:50,398
Does it look like
I'm kidding you?

00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:53,768
You waited for her
to get out of work

00:21:53,834 --> 00:21:57,004
so you could let her know
how you felt about her.

00:22:40,748 --> 00:22:42,516
It's really hard
to get rid of.

00:22:42,583 --> 00:22:45,886
Not if it isn't there.

00:22:53,127 --> 00:22:55,096
So the soda can bullet
and the leg bullet

00:22:55,162 --> 00:22:56,230
are from the same gun?

00:22:56,297 --> 00:22:57,998
Yeah. Bobby was able
to pull more stria

00:22:58,065 --> 00:23:00,267
off the leg bullet,
but still no IBIS hits.

00:23:00,334 --> 00:23:02,336
So what about
the phone guy, huh?

00:23:02,403 --> 00:23:03,971
The utility man's
always a shade-ball.

00:23:04,038 --> 00:23:05,539
As much as I love
your generalizations,

00:23:05,606 --> 00:23:07,274
actually,
this time you're wrong.

00:23:07,341 --> 00:23:11,212
The metallic scrapes on the
garage floor were titanium.

00:23:11,278 --> 00:23:12,913
The phone guy's tool

00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:14,615
was carbon steel.
Remember we thought

00:23:14,682 --> 00:23:16,016
that they
might be dealing meth?

00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:17,451
Brass went ahead

00:23:17,518 --> 00:23:19,587
and subpoenaed
the phone and bank records.

00:23:19,653 --> 00:23:22,990
Guess who's paying
Bianca's mortgage?

00:23:23,057 --> 00:23:24,225
A Mr. Harry Desmond.

00:23:24,291 --> 00:23:25,292
Happy Harry?

00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:26,694
Gas n' Sip Harry Desmond?

00:23:26,761 --> 00:23:28,295
Who's your daddy?

00:23:28,362 --> 00:23:29,597
No wonder she didn't work.

00:23:29,663 --> 00:23:31,565
He owns 50 Gas n' Sips in Vegas.

00:23:31,632 --> 00:23:33,567
Well, Harry was nice enough
to leave us a voice message

00:23:33,634 --> 00:23:36,971
that was listened to and saved
the night of the murder.

00:23:38,005 --> 00:23:39,373
Bianca, honey, it's Daddy.

00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,441
I got your message

00:23:40,508 --> 00:23:42,643
about moving to Colorado
with Ahren.

00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:43,778
You can borrow the cabin,

00:23:43,844 --> 00:23:44,945
but we need
to talk about this move.

00:23:45,012 --> 00:23:46,847
Call me, Princess. I love you.

00:23:46,914 --> 00:23:47,882
And this

00:23:47,948 --> 00:23:50,151
is the Desmond cabin
in Telluride.

00:23:50,217 --> 00:23:53,788
Oh, maybe Mr. Desmond is trying
to protect the family fortune.

00:23:53,854 --> 00:23:55,489
Or the family jewels.

00:23:56,357 --> 00:23:57,691
I got the results back

00:23:57,758 --> 00:23:59,794
from all those sex stains
on the sheets.

00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:03,230
Three donors: Ahren, Bianca
and Chelsea.

00:24:03,297 --> 00:24:06,000
I guess they <i>were</i> having
a little threesome.

00:24:06,067 --> 00:24:07,835
Yeah, I just really hope

00:24:07,902 --> 00:24:11,238
he was only doing one woman
at a time.

00:24:11,305 --> 00:24:13,874
Chelsea is Bianca's mother.

00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:21,333
Look, I know
what it's like

00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:24,436
to want to kill
your daughter's boyfriend.

00:24:24,503 --> 00:24:27,239
I don't pick fights
that I can't win.

00:24:27,306 --> 00:24:30,275
I kill this one,
I got five more dipsticks
waiting to take his place.

00:24:30,342 --> 00:24:32,444
I'd just be pushing
the rock up the hill.

00:24:32,511 --> 00:24:33,679
Besides,

00:24:33,746 --> 00:24:35,414
I was in New York
yesterday.

00:24:35,481 --> 00:24:38,016
Yeah, but you didn't want
them to move away together.

00:24:38,083 --> 00:24:40,018
I wanted Bianca to get a job.

00:24:40,085 --> 00:24:41,820
My biggest mistake
in life?

00:24:41,887 --> 00:24:44,289
Giving my baby everything
she ever wanted.

00:24:44,356 --> 00:24:46,658
Your wife doesn't seem to mind
your lifestyle.

00:24:46,725 --> 00:24:53,599
When Bianca was a teenager,
they fought like cats in a sack.

00:24:53,665 --> 00:24:56,635
It's good they've been
spending time together.

00:24:58,570 --> 00:24:59,972
Do you know what they're doing?

00:25:00,039 --> 00:25:04,176
Well... they're shopping,
dancing...

00:25:04,243 --> 00:25:05,878
You know, girl stuff.

00:25:05,944 --> 00:25:09,314
They're sleeping
with the same man.

00:25:20,793 --> 00:25:24,897
Look...

00:25:24,963 --> 00:25:26,131
there was no good reason

00:25:26,198 --> 00:25:28,500
for Chelsea to marry me
back in the day.

00:25:28,567 --> 00:25:30,736
I had a little money.

00:25:30,803 --> 00:25:32,738
Nothing like
what we have now.

00:25:32,805 --> 00:25:38,243
She was half my age
and ten times better looking.

00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:42,481
I thought if I kept her
on a long

00:25:42,548 --> 00:25:47,619
leash...

00:25:47,686 --> 00:25:50,389
maybe she'd never stray
that far.

00:25:50,456 --> 00:25:53,859
You the kind of guy that likes
to keep guns in the house?

00:25:53,926 --> 00:25:55,928
Yeah, of course.

00:25:55,994 --> 00:25:58,197
I'm going to need to see them.

00:26:00,566 --> 00:26:02,768
Hey, Catherine,

00:26:02,835 --> 00:26:05,537
I just got back trace
on Kelly Gordon's fingernails.

00:26:05,604 --> 00:26:07,840
I was looking
for air bag dust,

00:26:07,906 --> 00:26:10,075
but all Hodges found was air.

00:26:10,142 --> 00:26:11,210
Well, join the club.

00:26:11,276 --> 00:26:15,214
No usable prints on the
parking garage camera either.

00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:18,784
Okay, I'll have Sofia release
her from holding.

00:26:18,851 --> 00:26:20,652
Those the vic's phone records?

00:26:20,719 --> 00:26:21,687
Yeah.

00:26:21,754 --> 00:26:22,688
From her office.

00:26:22,755 --> 00:26:24,423
Lots of international calls.

00:26:26,425 --> 00:26:28,026
A lot of 345s.
Mm-hmm.

00:26:28,093 --> 00:26:29,361
Where's that?

00:26:29,428 --> 00:26:30,396
Cayman Islands.

00:26:30,462 --> 00:26:32,765
Popular with scuba divers
and money launderers.

00:26:32,831 --> 00:26:35,033
I called a few of the
numbers; all banks.

00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,935
Suggests offshore accounts.

00:26:37,002 --> 00:26:39,204
It's not illegal,
but it is very anonymous.

00:26:39,271 --> 00:26:41,640
It's also a good way
to siphon money away
from your clients.

00:26:41,707 --> 00:26:43,142
That's a leap.

00:26:43,208 --> 00:26:47,146
Hey, somebody wanted
this woman dead.

00:27:12,237 --> 00:27:14,006
GORDON:
Hi, CSI guy.

00:27:14,073 --> 00:27:17,409
You wondering why you're here?

00:27:17,476 --> 00:27:20,813
<i>Because you followed</i>
<i>the evidence.</i>

00:27:20,879 --> 00:27:24,183
<i>Because that's what CSIs do.</i>

00:27:24,249 --> 00:27:30,422
So breathe quick, breathe slow,
put your gun in your mouth

00:27:30,489 --> 00:27:32,357
and pull the trigger.

00:27:32,424 --> 00:27:37,429
Any way you like,
you're going to die here.

00:27:37,496 --> 00:27:40,966
Okay. Perfect.

00:27:46,705 --> 00:27:50,109
You're going to die here.

00:27:50,175 --> 00:27:53,045
Okay. Perfect.

00:27:56,982 --> 00:27:58,016
Hey, Archie.

00:27:58,083 --> 00:27:59,151
Hey, I did my best

00:27:59,218 --> 00:28:00,519
to enhance
the parking garage footage,

00:28:00,586 --> 00:28:04,223
but I just can't get an image
on the killer's face.

00:28:04,289 --> 00:28:05,524
If you got a couple
of minutes,

00:28:05,591 --> 00:28:06,558
I need a voice comparison.

00:28:06,625 --> 00:28:08,460
Yeah, what do you got?

00:28:08,527 --> 00:28:10,529
Kelly Gordon's voice on tape.

00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:13,265
I want to see
if it's the other voice

00:28:13,332 --> 00:28:15,067
on the Walter Gordon
audio file.

00:28:15,134 --> 00:28:17,636
Grissom told you.

00:28:17,703 --> 00:28:19,505
No, but he obviously
told you.

00:28:21,607 --> 00:28:22,875
Nick, uh...

00:28:22,941 --> 00:28:24,343
You know what?
Forget about it.

00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:25,477
If this girl's involved,

00:28:25,544 --> 00:28:27,312
that means she's capable
of murder.

00:28:27,379 --> 00:28:28,380
It's all cued up for you.

00:28:28,447 --> 00:28:30,082
Her voice is first.

00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,458
Grissom, it's Warrick.

00:28:33,458 --> 00:28:36,694
None of the guns Bobby
test-fired were a match

00:28:36,761 --> 00:28:37,862
to the bullets,

00:28:37,929 --> 00:28:41,933
but Chelsea Wannamaker purchased
a .22 in her name

00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,405
that was not picked up with
the warrant for Harry's guns.

00:28:47,472 --> 00:28:49,974
Okay. I'm on it.

00:28:54,913 --> 00:28:57,081
Mrs. Wannamaker.

00:29:00,218 --> 00:29:03,154
Wow, that's a hell
of a rock.

00:29:03,221 --> 00:29:05,990
I'm surprised
I didn't see that
the other night.

00:29:06,057 --> 00:29:07,759
Well, I don't feel safe
wearing this to a club.

00:29:07,825 --> 00:29:09,494
Is that why you own a gun?

00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,596
Well, I used to.

00:29:11,663 --> 00:29:14,032
But my gun was stolen
out of my purse,

00:29:14,098 --> 00:29:15,466
one night when we went out.

00:29:16,868 --> 00:29:19,604
Is there something you want
to say to me?

00:29:19,671 --> 00:29:23,474
You trying to buy back some time
there, Mrs. Wannamaker?

00:29:23,541 --> 00:29:27,278
Life's short,
but it doesn't end at 40.

00:29:27,345 --> 00:29:29,480
Oh, I agree with you.

00:29:29,547 --> 00:29:31,416
But it must be tough
for Bianca

00:29:31,482 --> 00:29:34,953
to have the kind
of mother that'd sleep
with her boyfriend.

00:29:37,021 --> 00:29:39,757
The thing with Ahren
the other night

00:29:39,824 --> 00:29:41,926
shouldn't have happened.

00:29:41,993 --> 00:29:44,929
We were on Ecstasy...

00:29:44,996 --> 00:29:49,167
and a line got crossed.

00:29:50,568 --> 00:29:51,069
Oh, yeah.

00:29:51,135 --> 00:29:54,172
Lay down.
Okay.

00:29:54,238 --> 00:29:55,273
I'll come back.

00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,041
All right,
you come right back.

00:30:10,655 --> 00:30:12,323
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:19,097
Oh, Chelsea, I'm... I'm sorry.

00:30:19,163 --> 00:30:20,865
I totally thought
you were Bianca.

00:30:20,932 --> 00:30:24,269
That felt so good.

00:30:34,579 --> 00:30:41,719
Bianca came in and found us.

00:30:41,786 --> 00:30:44,322
I wish it never would have
happened.

00:30:44,389 --> 00:30:47,792
What's that, getting busy
with her boyfriend

00:30:47,859 --> 00:30:48,826
or getting caught?

00:30:48,893 --> 00:30:50,662
I want into the living room

00:30:50,728 --> 00:30:53,431
and I let the two of them
talk it out.

00:30:53,498 --> 00:30:54,732
Next thing I know,

00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:56,734
she announced that
they were moving to Colorado,

00:30:56,801 --> 00:31:00,738
so it seemed to me
like they worked it out.

00:31:04,333 --> 00:31:05,801
SIDLE:
<i>Freud would have a field day</i>

00:31:05,868 --> 00:31:06,935
with this family.

00:31:07,002 --> 00:31:08,103
Dad loves his daughter,

00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:10,706
but Mom only sees the
daughter as competition.

00:31:10,772 --> 00:31:13,342
And everyone wonders why
Bianca can't meet a nice boy.

00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:15,544
Bianca eats nice boys
for brunch.

00:31:25,954 --> 00:31:27,756
Las Vegas Crime Lab.

00:31:41,236 --> 00:31:43,172
Oh. Sara.

00:31:44,573 --> 00:31:45,574
Bianca,

00:31:45,641 --> 00:31:47,409
can you hear me?

00:31:47,476 --> 00:31:49,611
We need an ambulance.

00:31:49,678 --> 00:31:52,815
Dispatch, this is CSI Brown.

00:31:52,881 --> 00:31:54,917
We have a woman down.
We need a paramedic.

00:32:03,709 --> 00:32:04,910
Hey, Bianca.

00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:06,485
How you feeling?

00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,188
Mr. and Mrs. Desmond...

00:32:10,255 --> 00:32:12,290
It's Wannamaker.

00:32:12,357 --> 00:32:13,658
She's never changed her name.

00:32:13,725 --> 00:32:16,661
Ms. Wannamaker,
I'm going to need

00:32:16,728 --> 00:32:18,230
a few moments alone
with Bianca.

00:32:29,274 --> 00:32:32,043
You never should've told him.

00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:35,380
My father's an optimist.
How do you think

00:32:35,447 --> 00:32:37,215
they stayed married
for 20 years?

00:32:37,282 --> 00:32:41,553
Bianca, I'm going to assume that
whoever did this to you

00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:44,556
also killed Ahren.

00:32:44,623 --> 00:32:47,225
And I'm also
going to assume

00:32:47,292 --> 00:32:49,995
that you know
who that is.

00:32:52,931 --> 00:32:54,032
I think you need

00:32:54,099 --> 00:32:56,535
to stop protecting everyone
from themselves.

00:32:56,601 --> 00:32:58,904
I can't.

00:33:02,941 --> 00:33:04,643
Excuse me.

00:33:04,709 --> 00:33:06,378
I just need to check
the swelling.

00:33:08,113 --> 00:33:09,848
How's the tenderness?

00:33:09,915 --> 00:33:11,750
It's fine.

00:33:15,053 --> 00:33:16,421
I hope you feel better.

00:33:20,792 --> 00:33:23,128
Nurse... Nurse?

00:33:23,195 --> 00:33:25,163
Can I get that glove
you were just using?

00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:28,133
I'm Sara Sidle, I'm with
the Las Vegas Crime Lab.

00:33:29,334 --> 00:33:31,336
Here you go.

00:33:31,403 --> 00:33:35,006
Thanks. Uh, I'm also going
to wait around for the SAE kit.

00:33:35,073 --> 00:33:36,741
She refused.

00:33:42,914 --> 00:33:44,115
Hey, Grissom...

00:33:44,182 --> 00:33:45,917
You want to talk to me?

00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:48,186
Yeah, sit down.

00:33:52,457 --> 00:33:55,160
I heard that Kelly Gordon

00:33:55,227 --> 00:33:57,129
may be a suspect
in your murder case.

00:33:57,195 --> 00:33:58,797
Yeah.

00:33:58,864 --> 00:34:00,132
Is that a problem?

00:34:00,198 --> 00:34:02,734
No.

00:34:02,801 --> 00:34:04,136
No, it's not a problem.

00:34:04,202 --> 00:34:07,906
And by the way,
I heard the tape.

00:34:07,973 --> 00:34:09,975
I did a voice comparison.

00:34:10,041 --> 00:34:13,245
SYLVIA MULLINS:
ROTH IRA, that'd be perfect
for you.

00:34:13,311 --> 00:34:16,615
Sylvia Mullins is the other
voice on the tape.

00:34:16,681 --> 00:34:19,985
She's Walter Gordon's
ex-business manager, so...

00:34:20,051 --> 00:34:22,287
I'm pretty sure she had

00:34:22,354 --> 00:34:24,022
something to do
with my kidnapping.

00:34:26,458 --> 00:34:27,726
But now she's dead.

00:34:27,793 --> 00:34:30,195
Yeah.

00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:34,266
So... it's over.

00:34:37,736 --> 00:34:39,137
Yep.

00:34:39,204 --> 00:34:40,305
Good.

00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,208
Good.

00:34:52,684 --> 00:34:56,855
I think Bianca is
covering for her father.

00:34:56,922 --> 00:34:59,925
Well, we figured out the sticky
stuff on Bianca's neck

00:34:59,991 --> 00:35:02,494
was creosote.
It's a timber preservative

00:35:02,561 --> 00:35:06,631
found on fences, telephone poles
and railroad ties.

00:35:06,698 --> 00:35:08,433
Justin lives on
the train tracks.

00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,535
And he's pretty tweaked out.

00:35:10,602 --> 00:35:12,838
Yeah, but he didn't
shoot himself.

00:35:12,904 --> 00:35:15,273
And I think that
if he had done it,

00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:18,710
Bianca would've told us.

00:35:18,777 --> 00:35:20,812
What is it?

00:35:20,879 --> 00:35:23,114
Telephone poles.

00:35:23,181 --> 00:35:27,486
Tom Harper's work order
for Bianca's DSL line

00:35:27,552 --> 00:35:29,988
was dated December 18.

00:35:30,055 --> 00:35:32,991
December 18...

00:35:33,058 --> 00:35:36,061
fell on a Sunday.

00:35:36,128 --> 00:35:38,330
How many workers you know
work on a Sunday?

00:35:38,396 --> 00:35:40,866
Is this the original document?

00:35:40,932 --> 00:35:42,134
Yeah.

00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,002
I'm on it.

00:35:44,069 --> 00:35:46,271
Always the utility guy.

00:36:16,101 --> 00:36:20,172
♪ ♪

00:36:29,781 --> 00:36:33,552
SIDLE:
<i>There were two different inks</i>
<i>on the work order,</i>

00:36:33,618 --> 00:36:37,489
which means the date on
the work order was compromised.

00:36:37,556 --> 00:36:39,858
Tom Harper made a service call
to Bianca's house

00:36:39,925 --> 00:36:43,094
not in December, but ten months
earlier, in February.

00:36:43,161 --> 00:36:44,896
Why would the guy lie?

00:36:44,963 --> 00:36:47,632
It appears that
he was a lot more to her

00:36:47,699 --> 00:36:48,667
than just the phone guy.

00:36:48,733 --> 00:36:51,470
Our bachelorette
was a very busy girl.

00:36:51,536 --> 00:36:55,507
Phone calls from Bianca to Tom
are in yellow,

00:36:55,574 --> 00:36:58,477
from Bianca to Justin
are in blue,

00:36:58,543 --> 00:37:00,145
and from Bianca to Ahren
are in pink.

00:37:00,212 --> 00:37:01,246
There was always overlap.

00:37:01,313 --> 00:37:03,782
Bachelor number one:
Tom, phone guy--

00:37:03,849 --> 00:37:07,819
strong showing from
February 18 until June-ish.

00:37:07,886 --> 00:37:09,621
She called him two,
three times a day.

00:37:09,688 --> 00:37:11,656
And then around June 5,

00:37:11,723 --> 00:37:15,060
bachelor number two
enters the picture-- Justin.

00:37:15,127 --> 00:37:16,428
Ten days of overlap

00:37:16,495 --> 00:37:19,798
and then all the calls to Tom
stopped until...

00:37:19,865 --> 00:37:21,867
The week Justin was shot
and moved out.

00:37:21,933 --> 00:37:22,968
Exactly.

00:37:23,034 --> 00:37:25,036
Ahren entered the picture

00:37:25,103 --> 00:37:28,173
about five days later
in mid-September.

00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,641
At that point,
all the phone calls

00:37:29,708 --> 00:37:32,344
to the other guys stopped
until just about

00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:33,578
a week ago.

00:37:33,645 --> 00:37:35,614
When she started
calling Tom again.

00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,450
Every time this chick calls Tom,
somebody gets shot.

00:37:38,517 --> 00:37:39,751
It's like thermite.

00:37:39,818 --> 00:37:41,119
Thermite?

00:37:41,186 --> 00:37:44,823
When you combine two seemingly
harmless elements--

00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:46,358
aluminum and rust--

00:37:46,424 --> 00:37:48,093
press them together, add heat...

00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,329
it creates an explosion so hot
it'll burn through steel.

00:37:51,396 --> 00:37:53,565
Powerful
but uncontrollable.

00:37:53,632 --> 00:37:54,699
It burns and burns

00:37:54,766 --> 00:37:56,835
until it burns itself out,

00:37:56,902 --> 00:37:59,037
finally consuming both elements.

00:37:59,104 --> 00:38:01,439
I guess some people
just shouldn't be together.

00:38:13,919 --> 00:38:16,388
Tom Harper! Come on down!

00:38:20,158 --> 00:38:22,994
You made me find you twice,
Tom, that's a drag.

00:38:23,061 --> 00:38:24,329
What's the problem?

00:38:24,396 --> 00:38:26,097
You know, I think you saw Bianca

00:38:26,164 --> 00:38:28,233
in her panties
more than once.

00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,735
SIDLE:
Now those could change a man.

00:38:32,737 --> 00:38:35,040
And it looks like they did.

00:38:37,909 --> 00:38:39,511
BRASS:
<i>You know,</i>
<i>it's fill in the blank.</i>

00:38:39,578 --> 00:38:41,580
If it walks like a stalker,
talks like a stalker...

00:38:41,646 --> 00:38:43,114
I'm not a stalker.

00:38:43,181 --> 00:38:44,416
Then what's this?

00:38:44,483 --> 00:38:46,117
Excellent service?

00:38:46,184 --> 00:38:49,554
Here's the top of the telephone
pole near Bianca's house.

00:38:49,621 --> 00:38:52,724
Ahren was tapping
your girl,

00:38:52,791 --> 00:38:54,392
so you started tapping
her phone.

00:38:56,294 --> 00:38:58,730
I only listened when I
thought she was in trouble.

00:38:58,797 --> 00:39:01,032
Look, her father called her
at 7:00 a.m. New York time,

00:39:01,099 --> 00:39:02,134
that's 4:00 in the morning
in Vegas.

00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,469
You had to be
on the pole to hear it

00:39:04,536 --> 00:39:06,471
because we were on the scene
an hour later.

00:39:06,538 --> 00:39:09,774
HARRY DESMOND:
Biana, honey, it's Daddy.

00:39:09,841 --> 00:39:12,577
I got your message about moving
to Colorado with Ahren.

00:39:13,879 --> 00:39:15,480
Stay away from Bianca.

00:39:15,547 --> 00:39:16,748
Who are you?

00:39:16,815 --> 00:39:18,817
You're not taking her
to Colorado.

00:39:18,884 --> 00:39:20,352
The hell I'm not.

00:39:22,621 --> 00:39:23,655
( <i>gunshot</i> )

00:39:45,644 --> 00:39:48,013
I just wanted her to be happy.

00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:50,015
With you and no one else.
No.

00:39:50,081 --> 00:39:52,117
Those other guys were jerks.

00:39:52,184 --> 00:39:54,319
I only wanted
to scare him off.

00:39:54,386 --> 00:39:56,655
Oh, like you did with Justin?
That worked.

00:39:56,721 --> 00:39:58,457
Yeah, but Bianca didn't come
running back to you,

00:39:58,523 --> 00:40:00,158
so I guess
you had to scare her, too.

00:40:00,225 --> 00:40:02,027
What are you doing here?

00:40:02,093 --> 00:40:03,228
I came to see you.

00:40:03,295 --> 00:40:04,896
I think you
should leave.

00:40:04,963 --> 00:40:06,364
Your mom wants us
to be together.

00:40:06,431 --> 00:40:07,466
My mom?!

00:40:07,532 --> 00:40:09,100
Let go!

00:40:11,603 --> 00:40:14,739
Her mother and I weren't
always going to be around

00:40:14,806 --> 00:40:16,274
to clean up her messes.

00:40:16,341 --> 00:40:18,343
Wait a minute.

00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:22,013
Are you telling me that Chelsea
asked you to hurt these guys?

00:40:24,349 --> 00:40:28,653
So you have some lunatic
stalker telephone repairman

00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:32,791
claiming that I told him to kill
my daughter's boyfriends?

00:40:32,858 --> 00:40:34,993
Give me a break.

00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,995
We have multiple calls
to him from Bianca's house

00:40:37,062 --> 00:40:38,296
and it was not her.

00:40:38,363 --> 00:40:39,631
We also have
on the record

00:40:39,698 --> 00:40:42,000
that you called him
from your cell.

00:40:42,067 --> 00:40:43,435
Coincidentally,
right around the time

00:40:43,502 --> 00:40:45,971
Justin was shot
and Ahren was killed.

00:40:46,037 --> 00:40:49,074
We call that solicitation
for murder.

00:40:49,141 --> 00:40:51,243
But you'd probably call it,
what, good mother?

00:40:51,309 --> 00:40:52,844
I love my daughter.

00:40:52,911 --> 00:40:55,347
Yeah, apparently, a lot
of her boyfriends, too.

00:40:55,413 --> 00:40:58,016
I called Tom.

00:40:58,083 --> 00:41:02,020
I asked him to scare
Justin away.

00:41:02,087 --> 00:41:03,889
He was after Bianca
for her money.

00:41:03,955 --> 00:41:05,857
I mean, we have
to protect ourselves.

00:41:05,924 --> 00:41:09,561
Yeah, but Ahren didn't love her
for her money.

00:41:09,628 --> 00:41:12,564
What was wrong
with him?

00:41:12,631 --> 00:41:16,935
So he was good enough for you,
but too good for your daughter,

00:41:17,002 --> 00:41:18,170
was that it?

00:41:18,236 --> 00:41:20,272
I mean, finding a soul
mate is hard enough,

00:41:20,338 --> 00:41:23,141
but competing with your mother,
that shouldn't be an issue.

00:41:23,208 --> 00:41:27,512
That goes against...
I don't know, nature.

00:41:27,579 --> 00:41:31,149
I was attracted to Ahren...

00:41:31,216 --> 00:41:36,521
and I was just trying to keep
him away from Bianca and me.

00:41:36,588 --> 00:41:39,090
Lady, you unleashed
an unstable man

00:41:39,157 --> 00:41:41,159
that you knew was in love
with your daughter.

00:41:42,928 --> 00:41:45,430
You had to know that that
was not going to end well.

00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,802
WILLOWS:
Oh, hey, Nick.

00:41:50,869 --> 00:41:53,472
Nick.
Yeah?

00:41:53,538 --> 00:41:55,373
We caught a break.

00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,809
The security guard
confessed.

00:41:57,876 --> 00:41:59,478
No.

00:41:59,544 --> 00:42:00,979
Archie isolated

00:42:01,046 --> 00:42:04,349
a frame of the killer
turning the focus ring.

00:42:13,358 --> 00:42:15,594
She did it.

00:42:23,335 --> 00:42:25,537
Las Vegas Police!
Open up!

00:42:31,877 --> 00:42:33,044
Kelly Gordon,
you're under arrest

00:42:33,111 --> 00:42:34,579
for the murder
of Sylvia Mullins.

00:42:34,646 --> 00:42:36,181
Stand up.

00:42:36,248 --> 00:42:38,650
Stand up!

00:42:43,555 --> 00:42:44,856
Care why I did it?

00:42:44,923 --> 00:42:47,359
Doesn't really matter now.

00:42:47,425 --> 00:42:50,662
She told me my dad
didn't leave me anything.

00:42:50,729 --> 00:42:52,798
He never would've
done that.

00:42:52,864 --> 00:42:55,534
He loved me.

00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,202
So you killed her?

00:42:57,269 --> 00:42:59,371
The ransom was her idea.

00:42:59,437 --> 00:43:01,039
She didn't get
the money.

00:43:01,106 --> 00:43:02,974
She took it from me.

00:43:07,245 --> 00:43:08,647
She's ODing.
She's ODing right now.

00:43:08,713 --> 00:43:09,848
Call a paramedic.

00:43:09,915 --> 00:43:11,716
Vicodine, INH, methadone.

00:43:11,783 --> 00:43:14,286
Kelly! Kelly!

00:43:14,352 --> 00:43:15,542
Kelly!
