Can you tell us
the exact location of the body?

00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,927
She was dumped in a flower bed,
wrapped in a shower curtain.

SINCLAIR:
<i>Dr. Robbins, can you tell us</i>
<i>how Stacy died?</i>

00:01:08,774 --> 00:01:11,276
ROBBINS:
<i>Beneath this laceration,</i>

00:01:11,343 --> 00:01:14,279
I found a complex fracture
of the occipital bone.

00:01:14,346 --> 00:01:18,250
Multiple shards of bone were
driven into the occipital lobe

00:01:18,317 --> 00:01:19,751
of the brain,

00:01:19,818 --> 00:01:21,086
resulting in massive bleeding.

00:01:21,153 --> 00:01:25,457
The cause of death was
cerebral hemorrhage,

00:01:25,524 --> 00:01:27,426
consistent with a single,
sharp blow to her head.

00:01:34,867 --> 00:01:36,969
A search of the
defendant's home

00:01:37,035 --> 00:01:39,137
yielded a
laundry hamper

00:01:39,204 --> 00:01:40,305
containing the
clothes he wore

00:01:40,372 --> 00:01:41,306
the night of
the murder.

00:01:41,373 --> 00:01:42,808
SINCLAIR:
Did you find any blood

00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:44,910
or DNA on the clothes?

00:01:44,977 --> 00:01:46,845
No. We determined
they had been bleached.

00:01:46,912 --> 00:01:51,016
Isn't bleach used to destroy
blood and DNA evidence?

00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:53,118
Objection: argumentative.
SINCLAIR:
Withdrawn.

00:01:53,185 --> 00:01:55,087
What else did you find
in the house?

00:01:55,153 --> 00:01:57,623
Human hairs consistent
with the victim

00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:01,159
were discovered in the drain
of the bathroom sink.

00:02:01,226 --> 00:02:02,594
DNA was extracted

00:02:02,661 --> 00:02:04,963
and was also matched
to the victim.

00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:08,467
And based on this evidence,
police arrested Marlon West.

00:02:09,501 --> 00:02:11,103
That's correct.

00:02:11,169 --> 00:02:12,938
SINCLAIR:
Thank you, Mr. Stokes.

00:02:13,005 --> 00:02:15,340
No further questions.

00:02:16,542 --> 00:02:19,044
The State now calls Hannah West.

00:02:19,111 --> 00:02:20,312
ALLRED:
Your Honor,

00:02:20,379 --> 00:02:21,680
defense reiterates
our objection.

00:02:21,747 --> 00:02:23,382
She's a 12-year-old girl.

00:02:23,448 --> 00:02:26,018
JUDGE:
We've been through
this already, counsel.

00:02:26,084 --> 00:02:28,987
The defendant's sister is being
called as a hostile witness.

00:02:29,054 --> 00:02:31,156
That means the district attorney
is permitted

00:02:31,223 --> 00:02:33,125
to ask leading
questions.

00:02:33,192 --> 00:02:34,726
Be nice.

00:02:43,969 --> 00:02:46,138
Now, Hannah,
isn't it a fact

00:02:46,205 --> 00:02:49,975
that on the night
of Friday, December 2, 2005,

00:02:50,042 --> 00:02:52,377
your parents left you
and your brother,

00:02:52,444 --> 00:02:54,146
the defendant,
home alone?

00:02:54,213 --> 00:02:55,480
They went away for a...

00:02:55,547 --> 00:02:56,548
Yes or no, please.

00:02:56,615 --> 00:02:58,050
Yes.

00:02:58,116 --> 00:02:59,985
SINCLAIR:
And isn't it
also a fact

00:03:00,052 --> 00:03:01,887
that you and your
brother were not together

00:03:01,954 --> 00:03:04,756
between the hours
of 6:00 and 10:00 p.m.?

00:03:04,823 --> 00:03:06,825
Well, Marlon--
he didn't really...

00:03:06,892 --> 00:03:08,026
Yes or no?

00:03:08,093 --> 00:03:09,895
Yes.

00:03:09,962 --> 00:03:10,896
SINCLAIR:
Thank you, Hannah.

00:03:10,963 --> 00:03:13,031
I'd like to say something...

00:03:13,098 --> 00:03:14,266
No further questions,
Your Honor.

00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:15,701
Cross-examination?

00:03:15,767 --> 00:03:17,669
Absolutely, Your Honor.

00:03:17,736 --> 00:03:19,705
Uh, Hannah,

00:03:19,771 --> 00:03:21,240
wh-what were
you trying to say?

00:03:21,306 --> 00:03:22,741
Objection:
calls for a narrative.

00:03:22,808 --> 00:03:23,876
Overruled.

You go ahead, Hannah.

00:03:25,511 --> 00:03:26,812
You say
what you need to say.

00:03:29,281 --> 00:03:32,351
Marlon didn't kill Stacy.

( <i>crowd murmuring</i> )

00:03:36,955 --> 00:03:38,090

the defense's
motion to dismiss.

00:04:31,832 --> 00:04:32,933
Of course he did.

00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,101
She's just a mixed-up kid

00:04:34,168 --> 00:04:35,436
trying to protect
her older brother.

00:04:35,502 --> 00:04:37,438
All the evidence
points to Marlon.

00:04:37,504 --> 00:04:39,106
Yeah, and all the jury's
going to remember

00:04:39,173 --> 00:04:40,607
is a little girl
in a bloody shirt

00:04:40,674 --> 00:04:41,775
confessing to murder.

00:04:41,842 --> 00:04:44,178
That's reasonable doubt
on a silver platter.

00:04:44,244 --> 00:04:45,446
All right, then we have to prove

00:04:45,512 --> 00:04:46,814
that Hannah could not
have done this.

00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,349
Exactly.

00:04:48,415 --> 00:04:50,084
We'll need a week
to reexamine the evidence.

00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:52,019
Judge gave the D.A.
a 72-hour continuance.

00:04:52,086 --> 00:04:53,620
Come on...
Best he could
do, Nick.

00:04:53,687 --> 00:04:56,190
Now you go do your best.

00:05:30,858 --> 00:05:33,227
MARLON:
<i>Everybody thought</i>
<i>Stacy was so...</i>

00:05:33,293 --> 00:05:34,928
special.

00:05:34,995 --> 00:05:36,764
She thought so, too.

00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,432
She wasn't.

00:05:38,499 --> 00:05:41,769
Stacy was a stuck-up bitch
and a miserable person.

00:05:41,835 --> 00:05:43,771
I just put her
out of her misery.

00:05:43,837 --> 00:05:45,939
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:05:46,006 --> 00:05:48,642
I killed her and I put her
in the ground.

00:05:48,709 --> 00:05:50,744
That's all I've got to say.

00:05:52,513 --> 00:05:54,114
The judge suppressed
the video

00:05:54,181 --> 00:05:56,283
because a child advocate
was never brought in,

00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,819
even though Marlon
had waived his rights.

00:05:58,886 --> 00:06:00,654
We really didn't need
a confession out of him.

00:06:00,721 --> 00:06:02,523
The case against this kid
was solid.

00:06:03,557 --> 00:06:05,726
<i>It started out as a prank:</i>

00:06:05,793 --> 00:06:08,362
<i>a sabotaged showerhead.</i>

00:06:08,429 --> 00:06:10,931
( <i>explosion</i> )
( <i>shrieking</i> )

00:06:10,998 --> 00:06:14,068
PH tests later revealed
the presence

00:06:14,134 --> 00:06:15,069
of a strong
base substance

00:06:15,135 --> 00:06:17,004
which was
later identified

00:06:17,071 --> 00:06:18,739
as sodium hydroxide.

00:06:18,806 --> 00:06:19,740
Sounds like Marlon packed

00:06:19,807 --> 00:06:21,241
the showerhead
with elemental sodium.

00:06:21,308 --> 00:06:22,743
A high school chemistry
favorite, yeah.

00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:24,378
Just add water,
and instant kaboom.

00:06:24,445 --> 00:06:25,913
BROWN:
Those out-of-order signs

00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:28,015
must've been part
of his game.

00:06:28,082 --> 00:06:31,552
You funnel the victim
to the right showerhead.

00:06:31,618 --> 00:06:32,753
Did you process these?

00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,922
Yeah, I matched
the spindle marks on the paper

00:06:34,988 --> 00:06:36,056
to a laser printer

00:06:36,123 --> 00:06:37,591
in the high
school library.

00:06:37,658 --> 00:06:39,093
Accessible to any student.

00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:40,728
Mm-hmm.

00:06:40,794 --> 00:06:43,063
"Multiple fragments of metal
penetrating the skin and dermis

00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:46,233
"as deep as
the superficial musculature

00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,035
of the back
and neck."

00:06:48,102 --> 00:06:49,937
The showerhead explosion
didn't kill her.

00:06:50,004 --> 00:06:51,472
No, no, it did not.

00:06:51,538 --> 00:06:53,974
What happened
to the shower curtain?

00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:55,376
STOKES:
Well, the vic was injured,

00:06:55,442 --> 00:06:56,610
disoriented.

00:06:56,677 --> 00:06:59,113
She grabbed the first thing
she could to cover up and ran.

00:06:59,179 --> 00:07:01,048
( <i>shrieking</i> )

00:07:01,115 --> 00:07:04,518
STOKES:
<i>The intermittent blood trail</i>
<i>started in the locker room</i>

00:07:04,585 --> 00:07:05,786
<i>and headed down a hall.</i>

00:07:07,321 --> 00:07:09,823
So Marlon followed her out
just to hear her squeal?

00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:11,759
Or chased her out, yeah.

00:07:11,825 --> 00:07:13,160
There's no way
to know.

00:07:13,227 --> 00:07:14,962
Either way, she ended up
at the bottom of the stairs.

00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:16,597
The size of the blood pool

00:07:16,664 --> 00:07:19,133
indicates that the fatal wound
occurred there.

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,401
Do you have
any physical evidence

00:07:20,467 --> 00:07:22,903
that would conclusively rule
Hannah out as a suspect?

00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:27,274
Well, yeah-- she's
four-foot-three and 65 pounds.

00:07:27,341 --> 00:07:30,411
The crime just required
more strength than she's got.

00:07:30,477 --> 00:07:32,579
How old is she?

00:07:32,646 --> 00:07:33,947
Twelve.

00:07:34,815 --> 00:07:35,949
In high school?

00:07:36,016 --> 00:07:37,851
She's a high school senior.

00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:39,953
She skipped
six grades.

00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,121
She's a prodigy.

00:07:41,188 --> 00:07:44,525
Which means she has the brains
for murder.

00:07:44,591 --> 00:07:45,759
Yeah, but not the brawn.

00:07:45,826 --> 00:07:47,828
The body was moved
from the high school building

00:07:47,895 --> 00:07:49,797
across a
football field

00:07:49,863 --> 00:07:50,931
and then hastily buried.

00:07:50,998 --> 00:07:54,268
The vic's car was then driven
two miles from campus

00:07:54,335 --> 00:07:56,036

Stacy's boyfriend--

00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:00,374
I think possibly to frame him.

00:08:00,441 --> 00:08:01,975
Was he ever a suspect?

00:08:02,042 --> 00:08:03,210
No. He plays varsity hoops.

00:08:03,277 --> 00:08:05,312
He was out of town
on an away game.

00:08:05,379 --> 00:08:07,715
I found blades of grass

00:08:07,781 --> 00:08:09,950
with blood on them
near the vic's car--

like you're just
going to snap.

00:09:56,323 --> 00:09:57,825
I know the feeling.

SIDLE:
<i>In his confession,</i>

00:10:01,061 --> 00:10:03,497
Marlon basically said
that Stacy deserved to die.

00:10:03,564 --> 00:10:05,566
He was alone
in that opinion.

00:10:05,632 --> 00:10:08,302
Everybody loved Stacy--
parents and students.

00:10:08,369 --> 00:10:12,506
4.0 GPA, varsity tennis
team, homecoming queen.

00:10:12,573 --> 00:10:14,608
She even took a public
virginity pledge

00:10:14,675 --> 00:10:16,710
with some of
her classmates.

00:10:16,777 --> 00:10:18,645
Did they have those
in your high school?

00:10:18,712 --> 00:10:20,080
No.

00:10:20,147 --> 00:10:21,648
Do you believe
that Marlon killed her?

00:10:21,715 --> 00:10:23,550
I was looking
right into his eyes

00:10:23,617 --> 00:10:25,285
when he told
me he did it.

00:10:25,352 --> 00:10:28,288
There's no doubt
in my mind.

00:10:28,355 --> 00:10:31,025
CURTIS:
Two confessions,
one crime.

00:10:31,091 --> 00:10:33,927
We don't get
that a lot.

00:10:33,994 --> 00:10:35,929
When did you last
speak with Marlon?

00:10:35,996 --> 00:10:39,099
The day the police came
to my house and arrested him.

00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:40,467
You don't visit him?

00:10:40,534 --> 00:10:42,503
My parents won't let me
see him in jail.

00:10:42,569 --> 00:10:44,271
Bad environment.

00:10:44,338 --> 00:10:47,441
Marlon didn't put me up
to this.

00:10:47,508 --> 00:10:48,909
He was trying to protect me.

00:10:48,976 --> 00:10:51,211
It would've been wrong
to let him be punished

00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:52,946
for something I did.

00:10:55,983 --> 00:10:58,619
You don't think
I could have done it.

00:10:58,686 --> 00:11:00,254
Neither one of you.

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,123
That's a big job
for a little girl.

00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:06,593
Not if you have
the right tools.

00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:10,764
Smart kid like you...
knows your brother's suffering.

00:11:10,831 --> 00:11:12,966
You feel bad,
you want to help,

00:11:13,033 --> 00:11:15,636
so you fabricate some evidence.

00:11:15,703 --> 00:11:17,671
If you thought
that the evidence was fake,

00:11:17,738 --> 00:11:19,473
I wouldn't still be in jail.

00:11:22,343 --> 00:11:25,145
Aren't you going to ask me
why I did it?

00:11:25,212 --> 00:11:27,047
Would you like to tell us?

00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:30,751
I throw off the curve.

00:11:30,818 --> 00:11:32,152
When I'm in a class,

00:11:32,219 --> 00:11:35,155
people who usually get A's,
suddenly get C's.

00:11:35,222 --> 00:11:37,491
Stacy was applying
to Harvard.

00:11:37,558 --> 00:11:40,094
She wanted me
to dumb myself down.

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,996
I said no.

00:11:42,062 --> 00:11:44,131
She didn't like that.

( <i>laughter</i> )

00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:01,782
So you killed her
because she messed up your hair?

00:12:01,849 --> 00:12:03,517
No.

00:12:03,584 --> 00:12:05,386
I'm used to pranks like that.

00:12:05,452 --> 00:12:08,188
I get them most every day.

00:12:08,255 --> 00:12:10,524
But Stacy...
didn't stop there.

00:12:10,591 --> 00:12:13,794
She had to take it
to another level.

00:12:13,861 --> 00:12:16,196
And she used Scott to do it.

00:12:16,263 --> 00:12:18,465
Scott Baird, Stacy's boyfriend.

00:12:18,532 --> 00:12:22,036
I was his tutor.

00:12:22,102 --> 00:12:23,971
SCOTT:
You know,
I was really pissed off

00:12:24,038 --> 00:12:25,706
at Stacy when I heard
about the whole...

00:12:25,773 --> 00:12:28,008
hair dryer thing,

00:12:28,075 --> 00:12:30,177
but her... her friends
had put her up to it.

00:12:30,244 --> 00:12:32,446
Stacy wanted me
to give you something.

00:12:34,481 --> 00:12:36,150
It's a
peace offering.

00:12:36,216 --> 00:12:38,452
I think you'll look great
in it at the Spring Formal.

00:12:40,387 --> 00:12:42,189
Oh, you are so going.

00:12:44,258 --> 00:12:46,560
You like him.

00:12:46,627 --> 00:12:49,697
He's on the basketball team.

00:12:49,763 --> 00:12:51,365
I'm 12; I'm not allowed

00:12:51,432 --> 00:12:53,734
to like him, but...

00:12:53,801 --> 00:12:55,336
I went anyway.

on MySpace that night.

00:13:33,774 --> 00:13:35,876
I got a ton of e-mails.

00:13:35,943 --> 00:13:38,112
You put sodium in the showerhead
to get back at her?

00:13:38,178 --> 00:13:41,615
A prank for a prank.

00:13:41,682 --> 00:13:43,550
I thought that there'd be
a few sparks,

00:13:43,617 --> 00:13:45,953
that she'd freak out
and that'd be it,

00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:49,890
but the nozzle exploded.

00:13:49,957 --> 00:13:54,461
Stacy ran... and fell
down the stairs...

00:13:54,528 --> 00:13:56,096
and died.

00:13:57,731 --> 00:14:00,300
I tried to cover it up.

00:14:00,367 --> 00:14:02,069
You miscalculated.

00:14:02,136 --> 00:14:05,372
I guess I did.

00:14:08,706 --> 00:14:09,455
You rang?

Hannah.

00:14:15,628 --> 00:14:18,297
So she fabricated
evidence,

00:14:18,364 --> 00:14:20,533
and put her own
blood on the shirt.

00:14:20,599 --> 00:14:21,967
Maybe, maybe not.

00:14:22,034 --> 00:14:24,470
The soil on the shirt was
consistent with the dump site.

00:14:24,537 --> 00:14:26,605
Hannah could've been
at the scene.

00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,976
<i>She could have cut herself</i>
<i>burying the body.</i>

00:14:34,246 --> 00:14:36,081
Or she could have gone
back to the field

at any time
within the last four months

00:14:37,883 --> 00:14:40,219
and rubbed her shirt in
the same kind of dirt.

00:14:40,286 --> 00:14:42,121
And counted on us
to make the match?

00:14:42,188 --> 00:14:43,656
Well, that's just plain
scary smart.

00:14:43,722 --> 00:14:45,691
I mean, my daughter's
a few years older than her,

00:14:45,758 --> 00:14:47,660
and the most important thing
on her mind right now

00:14:47,726 --> 00:14:49,795
is how much belly button
to show off at the mall.

My child's not capable

Of course.

Well, Marlon's your child, too.

00:15:15,387 --> 00:15:17,223
Marlon's from my wife's

00:15:17,289 --> 00:15:18,724
He's more like

No kidding.

00:15:34,206 --> 00:15:36,008
It's pretty much
the way I left it.

00:15:38,544 --> 00:15:41,080
The bleached clothes
were in the hamper.

00:15:42,715 --> 00:15:44,250
But the real action...

00:15:44,316 --> 00:15:46,519
was in here.

00:15:50,322 --> 00:15:53,993
Shared bathroom.
Very Brady.

00:15:54,059 --> 00:15:55,761
Pulled Stacy's hairs
out of the sink trap

00:15:55,828 --> 00:15:57,897
the first time through.

00:15:57,963 --> 00:16:01,367
And I found
some burn marks

00:16:01,433 --> 00:16:03,002
around the
bathtub drain.

00:16:03,068 --> 00:16:06,705
pH tested positive for
sodium hydroxide, so...

00:16:06,772 --> 00:16:10,376
I figured Marlon
probably did a test run.

00:16:39,538 --> 00:16:42,007
The scope of the warrant
only covered Marlon's room

00:16:42,074 --> 00:16:44,043
and other common areas
of the house.

00:16:44,109 --> 00:16:45,444
I popped my
head in here.

00:16:45,511 --> 00:16:47,947
Nothing in plain
sight at the time.

00:17:04,129 --> 00:17:05,498
Was this here before?

00:17:05,564 --> 00:17:07,032
It wasn't
in plain sight.

00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:08,334
I didn't check it.

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,669
Looks like Hannah
won the science fair

00:17:10,736 --> 00:17:12,371
with a project
about sodium.

00:17:16,008 --> 00:17:18,177
Hannah's just trying
to help Marlon.

00:17:18,244 --> 00:17:19,478
So they're close?

00:17:19,545 --> 00:17:21,347
No, not really.

00:17:21,413 --> 00:17:23,315
Sometimes I think
if they didn't share a bathroom,

00:17:23,382 --> 00:17:24,850
they wouldn't see each other
at all.

00:17:24,917 --> 00:17:26,152
What do you mean?

00:17:26,218 --> 00:17:27,753
They're on different
academic tracks.

00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,488
Never take any of
the same classes,

00:17:29,555 --> 00:17:32,591
and travel in completely
different social circles.

00:17:32,658 --> 00:17:33,993
From what we understand,

00:17:34,059 --> 00:17:36,495
Hannah doesn't really have
a social circle.

00:17:36,562 --> 00:17:40,099
The other students bore her.

00:17:47,273 --> 00:17:50,276

MAN:
<i>Sodium demonstration</i>
<i>is always</i>

00:20:40,246 --> 00:20:41,947
a real crowd pleaser.
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:20:42,014 --> 00:20:45,551
It's ended up in a senior
prank more than once.

00:20:45,618 --> 00:20:47,653
I keep it over here,
under lock and key,

00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,823
but, unfortunately, the lab's
always getting broken into.

00:20:54,093 --> 00:20:55,394
It's certainly possible

00:20:55,461 --> 00:20:56,662
Marlon got the sodium from here.

00:20:56,729 --> 00:20:58,330
Everyone have
their goggles on?

00:21:02,568 --> 00:21:05,104
( <i>students shouting</i> )

00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,474
Which is precisely
what I told the cops

00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:10,309
four months ago.

00:21:10,376 --> 00:21:11,877
You need gloves
to handle elemental sodium.

00:21:11,944 --> 00:21:13,012
Of course.

00:21:13,078 --> 00:21:15,114
It burns skin.

00:21:15,181 --> 00:21:17,416
We keep it in kerosene
to stabilize it.

00:21:17,483 --> 00:21:20,319
Do you think it's possible that
Hannah could have stolen it?

00:21:20,386 --> 00:21:22,655
Hannah would
never do that.

00:21:22,721 --> 00:21:26,892
I'm just wondering
if it's possible.

00:21:26,959 --> 00:21:28,527
She obviously has access

00:21:28,594 --> 00:21:30,863
to this room.
Ms. Sidle...

00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:33,966
I've had my share of good
students over the years,

00:21:34,033 --> 00:21:35,901
but Hannah...

00:21:35,968 --> 00:21:38,103
Sometimes, right in the
middle of a lecture,

00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:39,505
I'll catch her
staring at some

00:21:39,572 --> 00:21:42,875
little thing in the yard--
a tree, a squirrel...

00:21:42,942 --> 00:21:45,744
and all I can think about
is how much I wish

00:21:45,811 --> 00:21:47,680
I could see it
the way she does.

00:21:47,746 --> 00:21:49,582
If Hannah came
up and asked me

00:21:49,648 --> 00:21:52,051
for a chunk of sodium,
I'd give it to her,

00:21:52,117 --> 00:21:55,254
just to see what
she would do with it.

00:21:55,321 --> 00:21:58,724
The victim's car.

00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:00,993
Originally impounded...

00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,395
in front of
Scott Baird's house.

00:22:03,462 --> 00:22:06,298
Traces of blood and soil
consistent with the crime

00:22:06,365 --> 00:22:08,133
were found
in the front seat.

00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:12,838
Now, if Hannah's the killer,
she had to drive this car.

00:22:15,007 --> 00:22:16,876
Well, it's got adjustable seats,

00:22:16,942 --> 00:22:18,978
tilt and telescoping
steering wheel--

00:22:19,044 --> 00:22:20,346
it's certainly possible.

00:22:24,383 --> 00:22:26,986
Soil and blood
on the carpet.

00:22:27,052 --> 00:22:28,120
That was in the report.

00:22:40,099 --> 00:22:41,100
But this wasn't.

00:22:44,904 --> 00:22:47,139
( <i>tool ratcheting</i> )

( <i>grunting</i> )

00:23:12,498 --> 00:23:14,767
I'd say the killer
moved the seat.

00:23:14,834 --> 00:23:16,669
Yeah.

00:23:26,011 --> 00:23:27,480
12-year-old killer, huh?

00:23:27,546 --> 00:23:30,216
Starting to look
that way, yeah.

00:23:30,282 --> 00:23:32,551
I bet that <i>Grand Theft Auto</i>
had something to do with it.

00:23:32,618 --> 00:23:34,019
Mm, I don't know.

00:23:34,086 --> 00:23:35,855
I don't think Hannah's
really the video-game type.

00:23:35,921 --> 00:23:37,289
Never know.

00:23:37,356 --> 00:23:40,059
Between you and me, I actually
think it's a ton of fun.

00:23:42,595 --> 00:23:44,697

00:23:47,633 --> 00:23:50,236
WEBSTER:

to a Scott Baird.

00:23:50,302 --> 00:23:52,905
Isn't that the
victim's boyfriend?

00:23:56,041 --> 00:23:57,877
MR. BAIRD:
Two people confessed
to the murder,

00:23:57,943 --> 00:24:00,079
and now you're
accusing my son?

00:24:00,146 --> 00:24:02,481
Kids do stupid things.

00:24:02,548 --> 00:24:04,049
Marlon covers for Hannah,

00:24:04,116 --> 00:24:05,751
Hannah covers for Scott.

00:24:05,818 --> 00:24:07,720
Dad...
Don't say a word.

00:24:07,786 --> 00:24:10,489
DNA confirmed your fingerprint
in Stacy's car,

00:24:10,556 --> 00:24:12,091
in Stacy's blood.

00:24:12,158 --> 00:24:13,092
Scott loved Stacy.

00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:14,660
We all did.

00:24:14,727 --> 00:24:16,662
And when whoever
killed her

00:24:16,729 --> 00:24:19,398
parked her car in my
driveway to frame my son,

00:24:19,465 --> 00:24:21,267
I understood why
you had to talk to him.

00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:22,768
But this?

00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:26,038
That's it.

00:24:26,105 --> 00:24:28,240
We're leaving.
Come on, Scott.

00:24:28,307 --> 00:24:29,608
This is the only chance
you're going to get.

00:24:29,675 --> 00:24:31,744
If you walk
out that door,

00:24:31,811 --> 00:24:33,212
you're under arrest.

00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:34,213
I want a lawyer.

00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,214
I want to talk.

00:24:35,281 --> 00:24:36,282
Scott.

00:24:37,183 --> 00:24:38,484
Without my dad.

00:24:46,239 --> 00:24:48,174
( <i>over speaker</i> ):
This is ridiculous.

00:24:48,241 --> 00:24:50,510
I asked you guys
to rule out one suspect,

00:24:50,576 --> 00:24:52,712
now we have three.

00:24:52,779 --> 00:24:54,447
If he's willing
to talk,

00:24:54,514 --> 00:24:55,682
I'd say we
caught a break.

00:24:55,748 --> 00:24:57,617
The father's going to sue.

00:24:57,684 --> 00:24:59,252
Oh, I'd put
money on that.

00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:00,253
CURTIS:
Okay, Scott.

00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,688
You said you
wanted to talk.

00:25:01,754 --> 00:25:03,056
Let's talk.

00:25:03,122 --> 00:25:07,593
This doesn't get back
to our families, all right?

00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:10,863
My dad's a deacon,
and Stacy's dad is, too.

00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:13,199
They'll never understand.

00:25:13,266 --> 00:25:14,767
They won't hear
anything from me.

00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:21,307
I was pressuring Stacy
to have sex.

00:25:21,374 --> 00:25:23,776
She kept resisting.

00:25:23,843 --> 00:25:25,445
It was that stupid
virginity pledge

00:25:25,511 --> 00:25:28,548
that she had taken
at the high school.

00:25:28,614 --> 00:25:30,883
I told her that I loved her,

00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:34,253
and that nothing should
get in the way of that.

00:25:36,389 --> 00:25:37,991
Not even God.

00:25:38,057 --> 00:25:40,460
I take it that convinced her.

00:25:43,129 --> 00:25:44,130
Yeah.

00:25:47,033 --> 00:25:49,335
I mean, really?

00:25:49,402 --> 00:25:51,304
You really do?

00:25:51,371 --> 00:25:52,305
Yeah.

00:25:52,372 --> 00:25:54,941
I love you.

00:25:55,008 --> 00:25:57,377
I love you with
all of my heart.

00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,249
There was a little blood.

00:26:03,316 --> 00:26:06,519
Not a lot, but...

00:26:06,586 --> 00:26:10,456
After, she...
she started feeling guilty,

00:26:10,523 --> 00:26:12,525
so I went back into
the front of the car

00:26:12,592 --> 00:26:13,826
and I tossed
the condom.

00:26:13,893 --> 00:26:17,563
And... then I...

00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:19,299
wiped my fingers
under the seat.

00:26:19,365 --> 00:26:20,667

Hodges, Stokes.

Listen, there's a bloody
fingerprint in the back freezer

00:26:25,004 --> 00:26:26,806
from Stacy Vollmer's car.

00:26:26,873 --> 00:26:29,876
Pull it and test it for
spermicides and lubricants.

00:26:29,942 --> 00:26:31,344
We need it quickly,
all right?

00:26:31,411 --> 00:26:32,879
HODGES:
I'm on it.

00:26:32,945 --> 00:26:35,682
If it tests positive,
it will clear him.

00:26:35,748 --> 00:26:36,883
Yeah.

00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:39,018
Which means we're down
to Malcolm and Hannah.

00:26:39,085 --> 00:26:41,554
Right back where
we started.

00:26:41,621 --> 00:26:44,324
SCOTT:
Stacy said that
she was afraid

00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:47,560
that God would punish her
for having sex.

00:26:47,627 --> 00:26:50,196
I told her
that was crazy.

00:26:51,898 --> 00:26:54,133
Guess I was wrong.

00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:58,404
Hannah's computer.

00:26:58,471 --> 00:27:01,307
Most of her files are
encrypted AES-256.

00:27:01,374 --> 00:27:03,176
It's going to be nearly
impossible to crack.

00:27:03,242 --> 00:27:04,444
What do you mean
by "most"?

00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:05,445
Well, it's not much,

00:27:05,511 --> 00:27:07,413
but apparently Hannah
had I.P. access

00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,349
to the laser printer
in the high school library.

00:27:09,415 --> 00:27:11,818
Same one that printed
the "Out of Order"
signs for the shower.

00:27:11,884 --> 00:27:14,721
If she printed those signs,
it shows intent.

00:27:14,787 --> 00:27:15,722
Mm-hmm.

00:27:15,788 --> 00:27:17,657
Ah, teen lust.

00:27:17,724 --> 00:27:20,193
Starts with some chemistry,
and then you mess around

00:27:20,259 --> 00:27:21,728
with some biology,

00:27:21,794 --> 00:27:24,530
and once you have
some experience
"under your belt,"

00:27:24,597 --> 00:27:26,599
then you introduce the physics.

00:27:26,666 --> 00:27:29,235
Apparently,
chivalry is not dead:

00:27:29,302 --> 00:27:30,470

tested positive

So much for the boyfriend.

If we can't pin this on
Hannah or Marlon,

00:27:35,675 --> 00:27:38,244
they could both walk.

the entire distance.

00:29:48,541 --> 00:29:50,276
Not by herself.

00:29:52,045 --> 00:29:53,846
They did it together.

00:29:53,913 --> 00:29:55,548
DARCY:
So...

00:29:55,615 --> 00:29:57,283
Did I help the dead girl?

00:30:02,237 --> 00:30:04,806
If Marlon and Hannah
committed this crime together,

00:30:04,873 --> 00:30:06,641
then they're probably
still working as a team.

00:30:06,708 --> 00:30:07,909
It's all part
of the plan:

00:30:07,976 --> 00:30:09,945
he confesses,
then she confesses.

00:30:10,011 --> 00:30:11,179
Muddy the waters enough,

00:30:11,246 --> 00:30:14,382
they both get off
on reasonable doubt.
Mm-hmm.

00:30:14,449 --> 00:30:16,785
Well, if we can't get
one to implicate the other,

00:30:16,851 --> 00:30:18,320
we're screwed.

00:30:20,088 --> 00:30:21,189
I don't get it.

00:30:21,256 --> 00:30:22,357
What's wrong with you people?

00:30:22,424 --> 00:30:24,492
You want me to confess?
Again?

00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,528
Fine, I will.

00:30:26,595 --> 00:30:27,562
Marlon, you need
to confirm

00:30:27,629 --> 00:30:29,030
that you're willing
to talk to me

00:30:29,097 --> 00:30:30,765
without a parent
or lawyer present,

00:30:30,832 --> 00:30:32,701
just a child advocate.

00:30:32,767 --> 00:30:34,369
I already said that was okay.

00:30:34,436 --> 00:30:36,671
I killed Stacy, what else
do I have to tell you?

00:30:36,738 --> 00:30:40,141
Well, the truth works for me.

00:30:40,208 --> 00:30:41,276
I like the truth.

00:30:41,343 --> 00:30:43,211
HANNAH:
<i>Look, I don't need a lawyer,</i>

00:30:43,278 --> 00:30:44,512
and I don't need my parents.

00:30:44,579 --> 00:30:46,248
I just want to do what's right.

00:30:46,314 --> 00:30:49,084
Hannah, taking the blame
for something you didn't do

00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:51,486
may be noble, but it
doesn't make it right.

00:30:51,553 --> 00:30:53,755
That's deep.

00:30:54,589 --> 00:30:55,523
Okay.

00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:56,725
It happened like this:

00:30:56,791 --> 00:30:59,561
Stacy humiliated me,
I wanted revenge.

00:30:59,628 --> 00:31:01,329
Yeah, and you knew that
there was no way you were ever

00:31:01,396 --> 00:31:02,330
going to get it by yourself.

00:31:02,397 --> 00:31:04,332
STOKES:
<i>You moved the body,</i>

00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,868
you buried it...

00:31:06,935 --> 00:31:08,470
I know I did; I was there.

00:31:08,536 --> 00:31:09,838
What's the problem?

00:31:09,905 --> 00:31:12,173
Well, the problem is what
happened in the locker room.

00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,842
I mean, you're not
the kind of guy

00:31:13,909 --> 00:31:16,811
who puts sodium in a shower head
to get back at somebody.

00:31:16,878 --> 00:31:18,313
You just trip them
in the hallway.

00:31:19,981 --> 00:31:22,584
So you think I'm too stupid
to have done it.

00:31:22,651 --> 00:31:24,419
Great, join the club.

00:31:24,486 --> 00:31:26,688
I don't think
you're stupid, Marlon,

00:31:26,755 --> 00:31:29,124
I didn't say you were stupid.

00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:31,393
But this is Hannah's game.

00:31:31,459 --> 00:31:32,894
The whole way.
Uh-uh.

00:31:32,961 --> 00:31:34,262
I broke into the chem lab.

00:31:34,329 --> 00:31:35,530
I stole the sodium.

00:31:35,597 --> 00:31:36,531
Me.

00:31:36,598 --> 00:31:37,666
All by myself.

00:31:37,732 --> 00:31:39,000
It takes skills

00:31:39,067 --> 00:31:40,569
to handle a chemical
like that properly.

00:31:40,635 --> 00:31:44,472
And, quite frankly, man,
you just don't have the skills.

00:31:44,539 --> 00:31:46,141
Your prank went bad,
and Stacy

00:31:46,207 --> 00:31:47,576
ended up dead.
That's what I said.

00:31:47,642 --> 00:31:49,044
Marlon helped you
bury her.

00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:50,312
No. Why won't you believe me?

00:31:50,378 --> 00:31:51,613
Marlon wasn't there.

00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,381
Stay away from Hannah.

00:31:53,448 --> 00:31:55,317
She had nothing to do
with this.

00:31:55,383 --> 00:31:59,054
No, no, she had everything
to do with this.

00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,155
You two were working together

00:32:00,221 --> 00:32:01,590
from the beginning.
Just leave her alone.

00:32:01,656 --> 00:32:03,058
SIDLE:
<i>Marlon helped you</i>
<i>move the body.</i>

00:32:03,124 --> 00:32:05,327
He didn't!
You expect me
to believe

00:32:05,393 --> 00:32:06,695
that a little girl like you

00:32:06,761 --> 00:32:08,196
lugged a hundred pounds
of dead weight

00:32:08,263 --> 00:32:09,464
the length of a football field

00:32:09,531 --> 00:32:11,466
by yourself?
No, of course not,

00:32:11,533 --> 00:32:13,268
that's why
I had to use the cart.

00:32:14,636 --> 00:32:15,804
What cart?

00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:16,838
The electric cart.

00:32:16,905 --> 00:32:18,673
The one the landscapers
were using.

00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:21,509
It was just sitting there,
right outside the door.

00:32:24,713 --> 00:32:28,116
( <i>computer mouse clicking</i> )

00:32:29,684 --> 00:32:31,620
( <i>computer beeps</i> )

00:32:34,656 --> 00:32:36,791
Wait a minute.

00:32:36,858 --> 00:32:38,460
I got something.

00:32:39,427 --> 00:32:42,697
Let me clean up this image.

00:32:48,737 --> 00:32:50,605
I see a cart, Sara.

00:32:55,243 --> 00:32:57,612
So Hannah could be telling
the truth.

00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,614
It's enough
for reasonable doubt.

00:32:59,681 --> 00:33:03,318
Great.
Thanks, Warrick.

00:33:03,385 --> 00:33:05,387
BROWN:
Yeah.

00:33:12,394 --> 00:33:13,428
STOKES:
<i>The evidence says</i>

00:33:13,495 --> 00:33:14,996
either one of them
could have done it,

00:33:15,063 --> 00:33:16,998
but I think
they were in it together.

00:33:17,065 --> 00:33:19,034
Okay, I'll proceed
against Marlon

00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,369
for the murder and bring charges
against Hannah

00:33:21,436 --> 00:33:22,370
for conspiracy.

00:33:22,437 --> 00:33:23,672
Another trial?

00:33:23,738 --> 00:33:25,473
You sure you want to go
through all this again?

00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:27,709
SINCLAIR:
Stacy's parents
and the community

00:33:27,776 --> 00:33:29,377
will have my ass if I don't.

00:33:29,444 --> 00:33:30,679
Well, then maybe
this is good news.

00:33:30,745 --> 00:33:32,113
I was just going
over Sofia's notes

00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:34,316
from the original
investigation.

00:33:34,382 --> 00:33:35,383
The night of the murder,

00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:37,118
Hannah and Marlon's parents
had left them alone

00:33:37,185 --> 00:33:38,787
in the house.

00:33:38,853 --> 00:33:42,190
A pizza was delivered to
the residence around 9:00 p.m.

00:33:42,257 --> 00:33:44,359
That's right around
Stacy's T.O.D.

00:33:44,426 --> 00:33:46,861
So, did anybody talk
to the delivery guy?

00:33:46,928 --> 00:33:48,863
Yes, and at the point that
Sofia did, a month had passed.

00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:50,632
Now, the delivery guy's
at the house all the time.

00:33:50,699 --> 00:33:53,034
He recognized photos
of both kids,

00:33:53,101 --> 00:33:56,805
but he could not be sure
which one answered

00:33:56,871 --> 00:33:57,806
the door that night.

00:33:57,872 --> 00:34:00,275
But one of them
did answer the door.

00:34:01,343 --> 00:34:02,978
So that means
they were not together

00:34:03,044 --> 00:34:04,412
at the time Stacy was killed.

00:34:04,479 --> 00:34:05,814
Yeah. So much for conspiracy.

00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,949
We're right back
where we started.

00:34:08,016 --> 00:34:09,150
Where we are is in the crapper.

00:34:09,217 --> 00:34:10,485
Look, I have to disclose
the cart.

00:34:10,552 --> 00:34:12,320
Defense is going
to eat me alive.

00:34:12,387 --> 00:34:13,588
STOKES:
Marlon's your guy.

00:34:13,655 --> 00:34:15,323
He's your guy--
just because Hannah wasn't there

00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:16,725
doesn't mean
she didn't help plan this.

00:34:16,791 --> 00:34:19,561
Well, I sure hope it's Marlon,
because he's the one

00:34:19,628 --> 00:34:21,696
we have on trial.

00:34:21,763 --> 00:34:23,832
I stand by the
case we filed.

00:34:23,899 --> 00:34:24,833
I agree.

00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,868
The girl's just trying
to protect him.

00:34:27,903 --> 00:34:29,404
Sara?

00:34:34,576 --> 00:34:36,344
This was more about brains
than brawn.

00:34:36,411 --> 00:34:38,246
I think Hannah did it.

00:34:40,315 --> 00:34:42,284
Two out of three.

00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:46,454
In my world,
that's called an acquittal.

00:34:54,696 --> 00:34:55,964
High school.

00:34:56,031 --> 00:34:58,033
Even if you're popular,

00:34:58,099 --> 00:35:01,903
or a jock, or a brain...

00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:04,139
it can be hell.

00:35:04,205 --> 00:35:06,575
Everybody here remembers

00:35:06,641 --> 00:35:08,810
what it was like...

00:35:08,877 --> 00:35:10,779
what it was really like.

00:35:10,845 --> 00:35:12,747
Now take a look

00:35:12,814 --> 00:35:14,316
at Marlon West.

00:35:14,382 --> 00:35:18,353
Take a good, hard look.

00:35:20,055 --> 00:35:21,957
Not popular...

00:35:22,023 --> 00:35:26,061
<i>not a jock... not a brain.</i>

00:35:27,896 --> 00:35:32,667
<i>Now imagine what it must</i>
<i>be like to be Marlon West</i>

00:35:32,734 --> 00:35:36,605
<i>day after day after day</i>

00:35:36,671 --> 00:35:39,574
<i>in the sociological</i>
<i>pressure cooker of high</i>
<i>school.</i>

00:35:39,641 --> 00:35:44,512
<i>This imposing, struggling</i>
<i>outsider like Marlon</i>

00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:46,014
<i>resenting someone</i>

00:35:46,081 --> 00:35:47,415
<i>like Stacy Vollmer,</i>
<i>who made it look</i>

00:35:47,482 --> 00:35:53,421
<i>so easy to be popular,</i>
<i>athletic and smart.</i>

00:35:54,723 --> 00:35:58,860
<i>That strong resentment</i>
<i>was already festering</i>

00:35:58,927 --> 00:36:00,962
<i>when Stacy made</i>
<i>Marlon's sister the object</i>

00:36:01,029 --> 00:36:03,965
<i>of a typical high school prank.</i>

00:36:05,533 --> 00:36:08,703
<i>And that is when Marlon,</i>
<i>his resentment</i>

00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:11,373
boiling over, crossed a line:

00:36:11,439 --> 00:36:15,810
He stalked Stacy.

00:36:15,877 --> 00:36:17,712
You've seen and heard evidence

00:36:17,779 --> 00:36:22,317
illustrating the elaborate pains
he took to rig a shower head

00:36:22,384 --> 00:36:24,519
to torture Stacy,

00:36:24,586 --> 00:36:30,325
<i>how he forced her</i>
<i>to run and fall,</i>

00:36:30,392 --> 00:36:34,029
and watched her die
in a pool of her own blood.

00:36:34,095 --> 00:36:36,831
You know, for the first time
in his life,

00:36:36,898 --> 00:36:37,966
Marlon feels like a hero.

00:36:38,033 --> 00:36:40,835
He's not
invisible anymore.

00:36:40,902 --> 00:36:43,405
He's a killer...

00:36:43,471 --> 00:36:48,009
and he is guilty
beyond all reasonable doubt.

00:36:49,744 --> 00:36:51,813
ALLRED:
"Reasonable doubt."

00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:54,215
You know,
I'm not surprised

00:36:54,282 --> 00:36:56,785
to hear the prosecution
say those words,

00:36:56,851 --> 00:37:01,990
because its case offers nothing
but reasonable doubt.

00:37:02,057 --> 00:37:04,593
<i>Access to sodium?!</i>

00:37:04,659 --> 00:37:06,094
<i>Marlon couldn't find sodium</i>

00:37:06,161 --> 00:37:08,463
<i>on a periodic table</i>
<i>of the elements,</i>

00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:11,299
<i>let alone</i>
<i>a locked supply closet.</i>

00:37:11,366 --> 00:37:14,769
<i>Access to library printers?</i>

00:37:14,836 --> 00:37:18,306
<i>Do you really think</i>
<i>a kid like Marlon</i>

00:37:18,373 --> 00:37:22,777
<i>spends any time in a library?</i>

00:37:22,844 --> 00:37:25,981
<i>The shower head--</i>
<i>yes, Marlon's tall enough.</i>

00:37:26,047 --> 00:37:29,985
<i>He could reach it, but he still</i>
<i>would have had to have handled</i>

00:37:30,051 --> 00:37:35,156
<i>a volatile chemical</i>
<i>with expert safety precautions</i>

00:37:35,223 --> 00:37:39,427
<i>in order to orchestrate</i>
<i>an explosion.</i>

00:37:39,494 --> 00:37:40,829
I mean, ladies
and gentlemen,

00:37:40,895 --> 00:37:42,797
do you know
how to do that?

00:37:42,864 --> 00:37:45,500
I don't know how to do that.

00:37:45,567 --> 00:37:48,336
Right? You'd have to be...

00:37:48,403 --> 00:37:51,339
a genius.

00:37:54,175 --> 00:37:56,244
Marlon?

00:37:56,311 --> 00:37:59,180
Not a genius.

00:37:59,247 --> 00:38:00,448
You know, one
of the underpinnings

00:38:00,515 --> 00:38:03,852
of our justice system
is that it is better

00:38:03,919 --> 00:38:10,825
to send a hundred guilty men
free than to imprison even one

00:38:10,892 --> 00:38:13,662
who's innocent.

00:38:13,728 --> 00:38:18,166
Marlon West
is an innocent man.

00:38:18,233 --> 00:38:25,206
<i>Reasonable doubt compels you</i>
<i>to find him not guilty.</i>

00:38:28,276 --> 00:38:29,311
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

00:38:32,714 --> 00:38:34,883
( <i>second phone starts ringing</i> )

00:38:53,235 --> 00:38:54,636
Defendant shall rise.

00:38:56,838 --> 00:38:58,506
Madam Foreman,

00:38:58,573 --> 00:39:00,141
what is the jury's verdict?

00:39:00,208 --> 00:39:02,544
FOREMAN:
On the sole count
of murder in the first degree,

00:39:02,611 --> 00:39:04,946
we, the jury, find
the defendant, Marlon West...

00:39:05,013 --> 00:39:06,681
not guilty.

00:39:12,254 --> 00:39:13,788
( <i>sobbing</i> )
JUDGE:
So noted.

00:39:13,855 --> 00:39:16,157
Court orders the defendant
released from custody.

00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:17,726
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

00:39:17,792 --> 00:39:19,160
thank you
for your service.

00:39:19,227 --> 00:39:20,528
Court is adjourned.

00:39:20,595 --> 00:39:22,197
( <i>gavel bangs</i> )

00:39:51,059 --> 00:39:53,428
OFFICER:
Sign here.

00:39:59,601 --> 00:40:01,269
Hey, there.

00:40:01,336 --> 00:40:03,338
Did you come
to say bye?

00:40:03,405 --> 00:40:06,107
No. Actually, you and I
are going to be seeing

00:40:06,174 --> 00:40:07,108
a lot of each other.

00:40:07,175 --> 00:40:09,044
If you thought
the DA wouldn't prosecute

00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:11,513
a 12-year-old for murder,
you were wrong.

00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,949
He wants justice for Stacy
and her family.

00:40:14,015 --> 00:40:17,185
Of course.
He's a totally linear thinker.

00:40:17,252 --> 00:40:18,920
Most of you guys are.

00:40:18,987 --> 00:40:21,022
Shame on you,
Ms. Sidle.

00:40:21,089 --> 00:40:22,023
Come on, Hannah.

00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:23,625
You don't need
to listen to this.

00:40:23,692 --> 00:40:26,227
Mom, just give us a second.

00:40:33,335 --> 00:40:35,136
You were saying?

00:40:37,739 --> 00:40:38,740
Here.

00:40:44,846 --> 00:40:46,715
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:40:46,781 --> 00:40:49,050
Hannah, with your gifts,

00:40:49,117 --> 00:40:51,286
you could've done
anything you wanted,

00:40:51,353 --> 00:40:53,455
and you picked murder.

00:40:53,521 --> 00:40:55,523
You can't take
that back.

00:40:56,558 --> 00:40:58,893
You're worried
how I'm going turn out.

00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,495
Of course I am.

00:41:00,562 --> 00:41:02,664
I know it seems
like a really long time,

00:41:02,731 --> 00:41:05,166
but... in five years,

00:41:05,233 --> 00:41:08,136
the Stacies of the world
would've been behind you.

00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:10,505
Let me guess.

00:41:10,572 --> 00:41:12,173
You were a smart kid in school.

00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,976
Maybe you feel
we're a little bit alike.

00:41:15,043 --> 00:41:17,279
There aren't many people
like you.

00:41:17,345 --> 00:41:20,248
That's what my parents
always say, too.

00:41:21,249 --> 00:41:24,185
The last four months,
all they cared about

00:41:24,252 --> 00:41:28,623
was the effect of the trial
on me... not Marlon.

00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:30,692
It's been that way

00:41:30,759 --> 00:41:32,527
ever since I was 14 months old

00:41:32,594 --> 00:41:35,363
and started spelling words
with plastic letters.

00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:38,700
It's so unfair,
and nobody ever sees it.

00:41:40,735 --> 00:41:42,804
He doesn't deserve
to go to jail.

00:41:44,873 --> 00:41:49,411
If I get convicted,
what's the worst-case scenario?

00:41:49,477 --> 00:41:51,212
I mean, I'll be out
in five years

00:41:51,279 --> 00:41:53,348
with an undergraduate
degree.

00:41:53,415 --> 00:41:55,817
There's no "Son of Sam" law
in Nevada--

00:41:55,884 --> 00:41:57,652
that was ruled
unconstitutional--

00:41:57,719 --> 00:42:00,422
so I'm free to write a book
about all this.

00:42:01,456 --> 00:42:03,224
The story'll
be worth millions.

00:42:03,291 --> 00:42:05,994
Freaks are always
good box office.

00:42:06,061 --> 00:42:08,163
You're not a freak.

00:42:08,229 --> 00:42:10,999
When's the last time
you had to sit down

00:42:11,066 --> 00:42:13,735
to be eye-level with a murder
suspect who was standing up?

00:42:13,802 --> 00:42:15,804
Hannah, you are smart.

00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:17,672
So I've been told.

00:42:17,739 --> 00:42:19,507
But you're not smart enough
to get away with murder.

00:42:19,574 --> 00:42:21,176
I think I am.

00:42:21,243 --> 00:42:22,677
A lot of people
are smart enough

00:42:22,744 --> 00:42:24,045
to get away with murder.

00:42:24,112 --> 00:42:26,114
You probably are, too.

00:42:26,181 --> 00:42:28,183
But you have to be really smart

00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:31,786
to make people think things
happened that never did.

00:42:32,821 --> 00:42:35,790
What do you mean, exactly?

00:42:35,857 --> 00:42:37,025
Please don't worry about me.

00:42:37,092 --> 00:42:39,194
I'm going to be fine.

00:42:43,765 --> 00:42:46,701
( <i>whispering</i> ):
I didn't kill Stacy.

00:42:46,768 --> 00:42:48,404
Marlon did.
