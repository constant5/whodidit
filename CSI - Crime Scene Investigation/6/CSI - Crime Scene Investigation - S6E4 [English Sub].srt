and Charles Manson

00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,596
used sex to manipulate
their followers.

00:18:06,662 --> 00:18:09,732
I'm guessing
they were timing

00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:13,035
their ascension to the Orionid
meteor shower last night?

00:18:13,102 --> 00:18:15,905
So while you were watching
shooting stars, they were dying.

00:18:16,939 --> 00:18:18,708
There's 12 bunks in there,
one bed in here.

00:18:18,774 --> 00:18:19,709
There should be 13 bodies.

00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:21,577
One prophet,

00:18:21,644 --> 00:18:23,713
12 apostles.

00:18:25,514 --> 00:18:27,250
And two people are missing.

00:18:27,316 --> 00:18:29,518
Maybe they caught the spaceship.

00:18:31,787 --> 00:18:33,456
Well...

00:18:33,522 --> 00:18:36,459
would you settle
for a flying saucer?

came back
to a Vivian Bentley.

00:19:46,696 --> 00:19:49,298
She died two years ago
at the ripe old age of 90.

00:19:49,365 --> 00:19:50,633
Car was never

00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,634
Dead end.

00:19:51,701 --> 00:19:52,635
Not exactly.

00:19:52,702 --> 00:19:55,471
I also found a melted name tag
with a sunburst logo.

00:19:55,538 --> 00:19:57,306
Figured I'd let my fingers
do the walking.

00:19:57,373 --> 00:19:58,307
You scanned the
Yellow Pages.

00:19:58,374 --> 00:19:59,475
I knew the first

00:19:59,542 --> 00:20:00,977
By the way, do you know
how many companies

00:20:01,043 --> 00:20:02,979
in Las Vegas
start with S-U-N?

00:20:03,045 --> 00:20:04,814
I so don't care.

00:20:04,881 --> 00:20:07,650
Well, only one has
the sunburst logo:

00:20:07,717 --> 00:20:09,318
Sunview Travel Agency.

00:20:09,385 --> 00:20:12,154
Vivian's grandson,
Ty Bentley, works there.

00:20:12,221 --> 00:20:13,789
I pulled his DMV photo.

00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:17,860
That's the guy that was
dumped at the house.

00:20:17,927 --> 00:20:18,995
Brass is going
to check it out.

00:20:19,061 --> 00:20:20,329
How are we doing
on the other I.D.s?

00:20:20,396 --> 00:20:22,899
Including the one that
you just made, we got one.

00:20:25,334 --> 00:20:27,003
Ty hasn't been here
for the last two days.

00:20:27,069 --> 00:20:29,005
Didn't even call in.

00:20:29,071 --> 00:20:30,406
This is his desk.

00:20:31,574 --> 00:20:33,342
It's really not like him.

00:20:33,409 --> 00:20:35,144
Is he okay?

00:20:35,211 --> 00:20:36,679
Ty work here full time?

00:20:36,746 --> 00:20:39,482
Yeah. Puts in more hours
than anybody.

00:20:39,549 --> 00:20:41,183
Was he a member of any
religious organizations

00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,184
that you know of?

00:20:42,251 --> 00:20:46,856
I don't know.
It never really came up.

00:20:46,923 --> 00:20:48,624
Something happened to him,
didn't it?

00:20:50,726 --> 00:20:51,661
Yeah.

00:20:51,727 --> 00:20:54,897
So the last time you saw
him was two days ago?

00:20:54,964 --> 00:20:58,301
He's worked here over a year,
never raised his voice.

00:20:58,367 --> 00:21:01,404
Then this strange looking
customer came in.

00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,839
Ty must've known him...

00:21:03,906 --> 00:21:07,810
I want to talk to
Emma, you freak!

00:21:08,344 --> 00:21:11,180
She's moving on, boy.

00:21:13,849 --> 00:21:14,984
Would that customer's
information

00:21:15,051 --> 00:21:16,319
still be in
the computer?

00:21:16,385 --> 00:21:18,487
Nobody's touched it since.

00:21:18,554 --> 00:21:21,057
Should be the
last entry.

00:21:25,394 --> 00:21:28,064
Do you know the
person in this photo?

00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:30,733
That's Emma,
Ty's girlfriend.

00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:34,270
Well, ex-girlfriend.
They broke up last year.

00:21:34,337 --> 00:21:36,239
Here we go.

00:21:36,305 --> 00:21:39,208
Last customer was
a Joseph Diamond.

00:21:39,275 --> 00:21:43,312
Booking a trip to
Australia. Sydney.

00:21:43,379 --> 00:21:44,313
One way.

( <i>snickers</i> ):
One way.

00:21:49,785 --> 00:21:50,720
Any good news, Mandy?

00:21:50,786 --> 00:21:52,021
A little bit.

00:21:52,088 --> 00:21:53,689
A male d.b. at the bunker
matched your partial

00:21:53,756 --> 00:21:54,857
from the kitchen door.

00:21:54,924 --> 00:21:57,326
So far, he's the only one
with a record.

00:21:57,393 --> 00:22:00,396
Matthew Dickens, 19.

00:22:00,463 --> 00:22:01,397
Busts for petty theft.

00:22:01,464 --> 00:22:02,632
College student.

00:22:02,698 --> 00:22:03,966
Yeah, very impressionable.

00:22:04,033 --> 00:22:05,301
When I start my religion,

00:22:05,368 --> 00:22:07,536
that's where
I'm going to recruit.

00:22:09,405 --> 00:22:11,641
MAN:
<i>I remember him. Matt Dickens.</i>

00:22:11,707 --> 00:22:13,609
<i>We used to call him Hollywood.</i>

00:22:13,676 --> 00:22:15,311
He was in our, uh,
our freshman dorm.

00:22:15,378 --> 00:22:16,312
He was a...

00:22:16,379 --> 00:22:17,313
Religious
studies major.

00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:19,148
Right.
Hard core Trekkie, too.

00:22:19,215 --> 00:22:20,983
( <i>chuckles</i> ):
Mars bars.
Right.

00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:22,852
That dude loved
junk food.

00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:24,487
He smoked a ton of weed.
Guy was a loser.

00:22:27,123 --> 00:22:28,424
What do you mean?

00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,495
His parents sent him
loads of cash.

00:22:32,562 --> 00:22:33,496
He spent it all on dope,

00:22:33,563 --> 00:22:35,565
and then he stole stuff
to get more dope.

00:22:35,631 --> 00:22:37,333
According to the registrar,
he was taking classes

00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,635
till the end of term
last fall.

00:22:39,702 --> 00:22:41,270
Why did he leave?
He started
hanging out

00:22:41,337 --> 00:22:43,506
with some other losers,
and they convinced
him to drop out.

00:22:43,573 --> 00:22:45,508
Yeah, there was a redhead.

00:22:45,575 --> 00:22:46,776
She was hot,

00:22:46,842 --> 00:22:49,212
but in a... in a
weird kind of way.

00:22:49,278 --> 00:22:50,813
Hollywood was a moron.

00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,181
One week, the guy's
saving the whales,

00:22:52,248 --> 00:22:53,849
and the next week,
he's American Taliban.

00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:55,251
Yeah. He was totally
into that girl.

00:22:55,318 --> 00:22:56,485
She have a name?

00:22:56,552 --> 00:22:58,221
Emma.

00:22:58,287 --> 00:22:59,922
Was this her?

00:23:01,958 --> 00:23:03,826
Is she dead?

00:23:03,893 --> 00:23:04,994
They're all dead.

00:23:09,332 --> 00:23:12,435
Emma was working Hollywood
with some old guy named Diamond.

00:23:12,501 --> 00:23:13,669
Working him?

00:23:13,736 --> 00:23:14,670
Yeah, they
were running

00:23:14,737 --> 00:23:16,472
some kind of
religious scam.

00:23:16,539 --> 00:23:19,041
Emma tried to recruit me...
with her hands down my pants.

00:23:19,108 --> 00:23:20,610
She did that to me, too.

00:23:21,755 --> 00:23:22,689
No kidding?

00:23:22,756 --> 00:23:23,690
Yeah.

00:23:25,392 --> 00:23:27,093
Anyway, uh,

00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,461
the second she
started talking

00:23:28,528 --> 00:23:29,996
about outer space
and transcendence,

00:23:30,063 --> 00:23:31,798
I blew her off, 'cause
I do not waste time

00:23:31,865 --> 00:23:32,799
on crazy chicks.

00:23:32,866 --> 00:23:34,734
She was really hot,
though.

00:23:35,735 --> 00:23:37,437
That was almost
a year ago.

00:23:37,504 --> 00:23:39,172
Then the last time
I saw Hollywood,

00:23:39,239 --> 00:23:40,674
he was with some other freak.

00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:43,109
A notch down, though. Abbey...

00:23:43,176 --> 00:23:44,844
I think her name was.

00:23:44,911 --> 00:23:46,580
They said they were going
to some better place.

00:23:46,646 --> 00:23:48,915
I thought they meant UCLA.

00:23:48,982 --> 00:23:49,983
( <i>both chuckle</i> )

00:23:54,963 --> 00:23:57,566
Nick, I have a real low signal,
you're cutting in and out.

00:23:57,632 --> 00:23:58,233
Say that again.

00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,568
STOKES:
I said

00:23:59,634 --> 00:24:01,770
all the prints on the bottles
belong to the victims.

00:24:01,837 --> 00:24:03,538
The prints on the funnel
came back unknown though.

00:24:03,605 --> 00:24:05,807
And what about the blood
in the elevator shaft?

00:24:05,874 --> 00:24:06,975
It matched to Ty Bentley,

00:24:07,042 --> 00:24:08,477
but we can't confirm
he was murdered.

00:24:08,543 --> 00:24:10,379
For all we know,
he fell down that shaft.

00:24:10,445 --> 00:24:13,215
No, that's unlikely,
after all they torched his car,

00:24:13,281 --> 00:24:14,750
dragged his body three miles

00:24:14,816 --> 00:24:17,452
and dumped it
in the Copelands' backyard.

00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:19,421
Anything on the liquid
in the bottles?

00:24:19,488 --> 00:24:20,922
STOKES:
Yeah, Tox results
just came back:

00:24:20,989 --> 00:24:23,125
40 grams percent ethanol.

00:24:23,191 --> 00:24:24,259
Now, that's about 80 proof.

00:24:24,326 --> 00:24:25,961
Kind of smelled like vodka,
the cheap stuff.

00:24:26,028 --> 00:24:27,095
Nobody dies from a martini.

00:24:27,162 --> 00:24:28,597
No,

00:24:28,663 --> 00:24:30,565
but you add ten grams percent
of Ketamine and they do.

00:24:30,632 --> 00:24:32,501
Well, that's enough
to kill a horse.

00:24:32,567 --> 00:24:34,403
Yeah, or the Copelands' dog
for that matter.

00:24:34,469 --> 00:24:36,538
Ketamine's a disassociative
anesthetic

00:24:36,605 --> 00:24:38,840
which means
they were hallucinating,

00:24:38,907 --> 00:24:40,742
having out-of-body
experiences...

00:24:40,809 --> 00:24:43,145
So I was wrong,
they did take a trip.

00:24:43,211 --> 00:24:45,047
Well, there are
a lot of different ways

00:24:45,113 --> 00:24:46,348
they could have killed
themselves,

00:24:46,415 --> 00:24:47,949
so I'm guessing
that was the point.

00:24:48,016 --> 00:24:53,755
Ten percent grams of Ketamine
times 12 bottles,

00:24:53,822 --> 00:24:56,658
that's 300 milliliters
of Ketamine?

00:24:56,725 --> 00:24:58,093
Can't score that on the street.

00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,761
Well, we didn't find
any ephedrine,

00:24:59,828 --> 00:25:01,697
which is generally used
to cut Ketamine.

00:25:01,763 --> 00:25:05,100
Veterinarians use
liquid injectable Ketamine

00:25:05,167 --> 00:25:06,301
as an animal sedative,

00:25:06,368 --> 00:25:08,170
so Sophia's checking
with the local vets now.

00:25:08,236 --> 00:25:10,105
What did autopsy say
time of death was?

00:25:10,172 --> 00:25:11,373
3:15 a.m.?

00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,308
Between 3:00 and 3:30.

00:25:13,375 --> 00:25:14,710
How did you know that?

00:25:14,776 --> 00:25:16,745
That's when
the Orionid meteor shower

00:25:16,812 --> 00:25:17,813
passed over Vegas.

00:25:17,879 --> 00:25:20,182
Ask him if they all died
about the same time.

00:25:20,248 --> 00:25:22,384
Nick, was TOD
same for everyone?

00:25:22,451 --> 00:25:24,219
Approximately.

00:25:24,286 --> 00:25:25,420
It varied with body weight.

00:25:25,487 --> 00:25:27,489
Took between 12 and 20 minutes
for them to die.

00:25:30,792 --> 00:25:33,261
Ketamine's really
hard on the stomach,

00:25:33,328 --> 00:25:34,329
it induces vomiting.

00:25:36,565 --> 00:25:39,468
I think a combination
of alcohol and the drug

00:25:39,534 --> 00:25:40,836
just slowed their lungs.

00:25:47,909 --> 00:25:51,646
Ultimately, they died
of respiratory arrest.

00:25:51,713 --> 00:25:52,814
WILLOWS:
Okay, thanks, Nicki.

00:25:52,881 --> 00:25:55,083
Got to go.

00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:58,720
Did you notice
those buzzards earlier?

00:25:58,787 --> 00:26:00,756
GRISSOM:
No.

00:26:00,822 --> 00:26:03,191
But something sure
smells good to them.

00:26:09,097 --> 00:26:10,132
Say "ah."

00:26:10,198 --> 00:26:11,199
Ah.

00:26:11,266 --> 00:26:12,200
Ahh...

00:26:12,267 --> 00:26:13,201
Ahh...

00:26:13,268 --> 00:26:16,204
Sore throat, you say?

00:26:16,271 --> 00:26:20,409
Okay, I don't see
any inflammation.

00:26:20,475 --> 00:26:22,210
Take off your shirt, please.

00:26:26,014 --> 00:26:27,749
Can't we just make out?

00:26:40,162 --> 00:26:43,098
I'm working, Mr. Brown.

00:26:43,165 --> 00:26:46,268
I don't care, Mrs. Brown.

00:26:54,843 --> 00:26:57,245
There's nothing wrong with you.

00:26:57,312 --> 00:26:59,114
You're just working too hard.

00:26:59,181 --> 00:27:01,049
What time you get off shift?

00:27:01,116 --> 00:27:02,651
Midnight. You?

00:27:02,718 --> 00:27:04,853
Who knows.

00:27:09,725 --> 00:27:11,693

00:27:29,077 --> 00:27:30,645
Don't even say it, Warrick.

00:27:30,712 --> 00:27:32,280
I didn't say anything.

00:27:32,347 --> 00:27:33,648
You got to admit though,

00:27:33,715 --> 00:27:35,417
working around the ex is
a little strange.

00:27:35,484 --> 00:27:37,152
It was a long time ago.

00:27:37,219 --> 00:27:38,520
It was a year ago.

00:27:38,587 --> 00:27:40,922
You have to trust me.

00:27:40,989 --> 00:27:42,991
I do trust you.

00:27:43,058 --> 00:27:44,393
Look, there's still so much

00:27:44,459 --> 00:27:46,261
that we don't know
about each other yet.

00:27:46,328 --> 00:27:48,797
Okay?

00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:52,067
But we've got the rest
of our lives to figure it out.

00:28:09,117 --> 00:28:11,753
GRISSOM:
Are you having the same mirage
I'm having?

00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:14,523
A silver Beemer in the middle
of the damn desert?

00:28:14,589 --> 00:28:15,557
Yeah.

00:28:15,624 --> 00:28:18,727
Nice wheels.

00:28:18,794 --> 00:28:22,531
Somebody sure went out of
their way to hide this car.

00:28:22,597 --> 00:28:25,567
Well, you can sure smell
what the buzzards are after.

00:28:25,634 --> 00:28:27,402
Decomp.

00:28:41,616 --> 00:28:43,852
WILLOWS:
Fits the description
of the leader, Joseph Diamond.

00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:46,054
Guess he never made it
to Australia.

00:28:46,121 --> 00:28:49,024
Something tells me
this wasn't a suicide.

00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:54,229
Like this tire iron.

00:28:54,296 --> 00:28:56,398
Convenient weapon of choice.

00:28:56,465 --> 00:28:57,766
Well, assuming this is Diamond

00:28:57,833 --> 00:29:00,102
and Ty Bentley was
a spurned lover

00:29:00,168 --> 00:29:02,237
and not a member
of the cult...

00:29:02,304 --> 00:29:03,939
we're still short one body.

00:29:04,005 --> 00:29:07,709
Which I believe makes that body
our number one suspect.

00:30:02,731 --> 00:30:03,865
( <i>machine beeps</i> )

00:30:19,881 --> 00:30:21,483
( <i>whirring</i> )

00:30:35,197 --> 00:30:38,467
WOMAN:
<i>"Thank you for writing, your</i>
<i>father and I miss you so</i>
<i>much."</i>

00:30:38,533 --> 00:30:41,002
MAN:
<i>"Money's kind of tight,</i>
<i>I hope this helps.</i>

00:30:41,069 --> 00:30:42,537
<i>Send more when I can."</i>

00:30:42,604 --> 00:30:45,107
WOMAN:
<i>"Mom and Dad went to the police</i>
<i>to report you missing.</i>

00:30:45,173 --> 00:30:47,075
<i>Please come home,</i>
<i>even if it's just a visit."</i>

00:30:47,142 --> 00:30:49,211
MAN:
<i>"I don't understand what</i>
<i>you're doing with your life.</i>

00:30:49,277 --> 00:30:51,213
<i>Your roommate says</i>
<i>you left your things behind."</i>

00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:54,349
MAN 2:
<i>"I wish you could tell me</i>
<i>why you need this money."</i>

00:30:54,416 --> 00:30:56,551
MAN 3:
<i>"Mom says you joined a commune.</i>

00:30:56,618 --> 00:30:58,954
<i>"She's mad.</i>

00:30:59,020 --> 00:30:59,955
<i>"Hey, Dad sent the money.</i>

00:31:00,021 --> 00:31:01,189
<i>When you talk to Mom..."</i>

00:31:01,256 --> 00:31:03,458
WOMAN:
<i>"No more money until</i>
<i>I hear from you.</i>

00:31:03,525 --> 00:31:04,760
<i>I love you."</i>

00:31:07,229 --> 00:31:09,798
BRASS:
The FBI keeps tabs
on high-risk groups,

00:31:09,865 --> 00:31:12,067
cults,
religious fanatics.

00:31:12,134 --> 00:31:14,169
They were good enough
to fax this over.

00:31:14,236 --> 00:31:15,370
Makes good reading.

00:31:18,006 --> 00:31:21,209
"Joseph Diamond,
a.k.a. Sirus Bent,

00:31:21,276 --> 00:31:22,978
a.k.a. Kelvin Adams..."

00:31:23,045 --> 00:31:26,615
Yeah, he founded a group called
"Soul Salvation"

00:31:26,681 --> 00:31:28,650
in Tulsa in the mid-90s.

00:31:28,717 --> 00:31:29,785
A few years later,

00:31:29,851 --> 00:31:32,220
same thing in
Guadalajara, Mexico.

00:31:32,287 --> 00:31:34,156
"Recruited susceptible youths,

00:31:34,222 --> 00:31:37,025
keeping them isolated
for nine months to a year."

00:31:37,092 --> 00:31:39,094
Yeah, prior to the arrival
of the mother ship,

00:31:39,161 --> 00:31:40,962
which they can only enter
in spirit form,

00:31:41,029 --> 00:31:42,597
leaving their temporal vehicles,

00:31:42,664 --> 00:31:44,132
their bodies,
behind.

00:31:44,199 --> 00:31:45,534
Mass suicide.

00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,702
Attempted mass suicide.

00:31:46,768 --> 00:31:49,905
They woke up--
probably with a hangover--

00:31:49,971 --> 00:31:52,174
and both Diamond
and their money were gone.

00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,942
And in both cases,

00:31:54,009 --> 00:31:57,479
his disappearance coincided
with a meteor shower

00:31:57,546 --> 00:31:59,214
just like the one last night.

00:31:59,281 --> 00:32:02,417
Only last night everybody died.

00:32:02,484 --> 00:32:05,087
ROBBINS:
Depressed fracture.

00:32:05,153 --> 00:32:06,588
Well, we found a tire iron
at the scene.

00:32:06,655 --> 00:32:08,056
That would do it.

00:32:08,123 --> 00:32:09,891
What about TOD?

00:32:09,958 --> 00:32:11,293
Well, it's hard to say.

00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,961
Desert heat,
locked in a trunk...

00:32:13,028 --> 00:32:16,098
Both can make liver temp
actually rise.

00:32:16,164 --> 00:32:18,367
What about relative
to the other bodies?

00:32:18,433 --> 00:32:20,402
Did he die before
or after the others?

00:32:20,469 --> 00:32:22,337
ROBBINS:
Given the degree
of decomp,

00:32:22,404 --> 00:32:23,972
it appears that he died
before the others.

00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:26,408
I can run some chemical tests,

00:32:26,475 --> 00:32:28,143
but that's going to take
some time.

00:32:29,911 --> 00:32:30,912
PHILLIPS:
What's this?

00:32:36,651 --> 00:32:38,320
Hmm, looks like a money belt.

00:32:39,721 --> 00:32:43,225
Gives new meaning
to "strapped for cash."

00:32:43,291 --> 00:32:44,659
Diamond was running
a cash business.

00:32:44,726 --> 00:32:48,163
He had all those kids
write home and ask for money.

00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:51,566
His return address was
a P.O. box that I found.

00:32:51,633 --> 00:32:53,268
I didn't find
any undigested pills

00:32:53,335 --> 00:32:54,269
in the victims'
stomachs.

00:32:54,336 --> 00:32:55,670
BROWN:
We assumed that

00:32:55,737 --> 00:32:57,172
they were ingesting
a liquid Ketamine.

00:32:57,239 --> 00:32:59,074
So what are these?

00:32:59,141 --> 00:33:00,075
MAN:
Zolpidem.

00:33:00,142 --> 00:33:02,310
Popped one
when I went to Europe.

00:33:02,377 --> 00:33:04,112
Six hours sleep,
no hangover.

00:33:05,447 --> 00:33:07,649
Are there enough pills
in that bag to kill 11 people?

00:33:07,716 --> 00:33:09,451
Well, if only one person
downed all these,

00:33:09,518 --> 00:33:10,452
yes, it'd be lethal.

00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:11,820
But divvied up, no way.

00:33:11,887 --> 00:33:13,188
Zolpidem's a pretty safe
sedative.

00:33:13,255 --> 00:33:15,190
And from what we know,
Diamond was a con man,

00:33:15,257 --> 00:33:16,458
not a murderer.

00:33:16,525 --> 00:33:19,194
SANDERS:
Hey, I lifted a partial
off that tire iron.

00:33:19,261 --> 00:33:20,595
Matched it to a print

00:33:20,662 --> 00:33:22,531
that Nick lifted off
the funnel from the bunker.

00:33:22,597 --> 00:33:24,833
Whoever whacked Diamond mixed
the Ketamine cocktail.

00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:27,569
So who brought the Ketamine
to the party?

00:33:33,046 --> 00:33:34,681
( <i>barking</i> )

00:33:34,747 --> 00:33:36,949
They had a break-in
the day before yesterday.

00:33:37,016 --> 00:33:38,451
Has it been forensicated?

00:33:38,518 --> 00:33:41,888
Not yet.
Not much stolen, so...

00:33:41,954 --> 00:33:42,889
It's a low
priority for CSI.

00:33:42,955 --> 00:33:44,090
Expensive equipment,

00:33:44,157 --> 00:33:45,591
pharmaceuticals--
doctor even had

00:33:45,658 --> 00:33:46,926
his laptop open
on the desk.

00:33:46,993 --> 00:33:49,262
They obviously knew
what they wanted

00:33:49,329 --> 00:33:50,797
Hmm, and where
to look for it.

00:33:50,863 --> 00:33:52,965
Drugs have been
alphabetized.

00:33:53,032 --> 00:33:54,967
Missing drug was

00:33:55,034 --> 00:33:57,603
between Ivermectin
Otic Suspension

00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:59,072
and Methocarbamol.

00:33:59,138 --> 00:34:00,106
"K" for Ketamine.

00:34:00,173 --> 00:34:02,108
Yeah. They took it all.

00:34:02,175 --> 00:34:04,010
Okay, well, it's
probably an inside job.

00:34:04,077 --> 00:34:07,080
Just get me a list
of current and former
employees, and we'll...

00:34:07,146 --> 00:34:08,481
go from there. Thanks.

00:34:10,283 --> 00:34:12,652
Wow, it's alphabetized.

00:34:14,354 --> 00:34:16,022
Now what are you doing?

00:34:16,089 --> 00:34:17,757
You'll be dusting for prints.

00:34:17,824 --> 00:34:19,058
I'll help.

00:34:20,093 --> 00:34:22,095
Okay.

00:34:41,514 --> 00:34:43,116
That's Emma.

00:34:43,182 --> 00:34:45,551
That's our daughter.

00:34:53,526 --> 00:34:55,795
( <i>sobbing</i> )

00:35:05,304 --> 00:35:07,140
Excuse me, sir.

00:35:07,206 --> 00:35:10,209
Mrs. Spencer
isn't here.

00:35:10,276 --> 00:35:12,712
Her daughter went to
college with Emma.

00:35:12,779 --> 00:35:14,747
They disappeared
at the same time.

00:35:14,814 --> 00:35:16,582
Uh, we both
received letters

00:35:16,649 --> 00:35:17,750
from them last month.

00:35:18,785 --> 00:35:20,753
Spencer, you said?

00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:23,089
Her daughter's
name was Abigail.

00:35:23,156 --> 00:35:25,825
Well, ma'am, you see,
the letters that we recovered

00:35:25,892 --> 00:35:26,826
were damaged.

00:35:26,893 --> 00:35:28,561
Not all of them yielded a name.

00:35:28,628 --> 00:35:32,165
Well, perhaps she was luckier
than me.

00:35:35,268 --> 00:35:36,402
Ma'am...

00:35:36,469 --> 00:35:40,173
would you be able
to identify Abigail?

00:35:42,675 --> 00:35:45,178
Absolutely.

00:35:50,817 --> 00:35:55,788
Nick, you have that employee
list from the vet's office?

00:35:56,789 --> 00:35:58,558
The prints found
at the clinic break-in

00:35:58,624 --> 00:36:00,226
are a perfect match
to the ones lifted

00:36:00,293 --> 00:36:03,229
off the tire iron
and the funnel.

00:36:03,296 --> 00:36:04,597
Abigail Spencer.

00:36:04,664 --> 00:36:06,032
She was a cult member.

00:36:06,099 --> 00:36:08,067
She used to work for your vet
until last year,

00:36:08,134 --> 00:36:09,469
and she's missing.

00:36:09,535 --> 00:36:11,204
Her W-2's in the file.

00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:12,739
I'll call Brass.

00:36:12,805 --> 00:36:14,207
( <i>knocking at door</i> )

00:36:14,273 --> 00:36:15,975
BRASS:
Mrs. Spencer?

00:36:16,042 --> 00:36:16,976
Yeah?

00:36:17,043 --> 00:36:19,245
I'm Detective Jim
Brass, Las Vegas Police.

00:36:19,312 --> 00:36:21,214
Do you have a daughter
named Abigail?

00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,616
Yes. Why?

00:36:23,683 --> 00:36:25,451
We have a warrant to
search these premises.

00:36:25,518 --> 00:36:26,786
A warrant? What for?

00:36:26,853 --> 00:36:27,787
Your daughter
is wanted

00:36:27,854 --> 00:36:28,788
for questioning
in the murder

00:36:28,855 --> 00:36:29,922
of Joseph Diamond.

00:36:29,989 --> 00:36:32,792
I haven't seen Abigail
in almost a year.

00:36:32,859 --> 00:36:34,160
I have no idea
where she is.

00:36:40,299 --> 00:36:43,036
The bed's still warm.
Where is she?

00:36:54,814 --> 00:36:56,783
( <i>panting</i> )

00:37:12,799 --> 00:37:14,567
( <i>chokes</i> )

00:37:22,275 --> 00:37:24,644
( <i>coughing</i> )

00:37:32,318 --> 00:37:35,355
Take me with you.

00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,162
( <i>rumbling</i> )

00:38:13,526 --> 00:38:16,262

MAN ( <i>over helicopter speaker):</i>
Freeze! Remain where you are.

00:38:36,149 --> 00:38:38,651
Abigail?

00:38:39,686 --> 00:38:41,587
You pumped my stomach?

00:38:41,654 --> 00:38:45,658
Yeah. Just in time.

00:38:54,334 --> 00:38:56,936
Are you disappointed?

00:38:57,937 --> 00:39:01,074
They're all up
there right now.

00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:03,042
In rapture.

00:39:03,109 --> 00:39:06,112
A higher plane
of existence.

00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:13,119
No wars, poverty,
politics.

00:39:15,621 --> 00:39:17,890
Our bodies are
just shells.

00:39:17,957 --> 00:39:20,226
They're worthless.

00:39:20,293 --> 00:39:23,463
Well, how come you didn't die
with your friends?

00:39:24,497 --> 00:39:26,065
And why exactly

00:39:26,132 --> 00:39:28,401
did you kill Mr. Diamond?

00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:34,173
He was the most beautiful person
I ever met.

00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:38,878
( <i>Mr. Diamond telling stories,</i>
<i>overlapping each other</i> )

00:39:51,457 --> 00:39:54,260
We found your fingerprint
on a tire iron

00:39:54,327 --> 00:39:56,396
that was used
to split his head open.

00:39:57,430 --> 00:40:00,933
He always said we'd be tested.

00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,236
<i>I was taking a walk</i>
<i>when I spotted a car</i>

00:40:03,302 --> 00:40:06,673
<i>parking about a mile away</i>
<i>from the compound.</i>

00:40:06,739 --> 00:40:07,740
Whose car is this?

00:40:07,807 --> 00:40:09,075
Where have you been?

00:40:09,142 --> 00:40:12,045
I received a message last night
from the Orionid.

00:40:12,111 --> 00:40:13,579
I have to move on,

00:40:13,646 --> 00:40:14,781
spread the word.

00:40:14,847 --> 00:40:16,282
What about us?

00:40:16,349 --> 00:40:17,650
Come with me, Abbey.

00:40:17,717 --> 00:40:20,119
We'll do it together...

00:40:20,186 --> 00:40:21,754
somewhere near a beach.

00:40:23,723 --> 00:40:27,360
We're ascending tomorrow night
to the mother ship.

00:40:27,427 --> 00:40:29,796
You're a smart girl.

00:40:29,862 --> 00:40:32,298
Just two or three of these,
and everyone will get

00:40:32,365 --> 00:40:34,300
a real good night's sleep.

00:40:34,367 --> 00:40:36,302
Time to get
out of town.

00:40:36,369 --> 00:40:38,004
Everyone's parents have
been really good to me.

00:40:38,071 --> 00:40:40,340
I got 40 grand.

00:40:41,374 --> 00:40:44,243
I knew the others
would be looking to me now.

00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:46,212
But you didn't tell them,
did you?

00:40:46,279 --> 00:40:49,048
We were on a schedule.

00:40:49,115 --> 00:40:50,817
And fortunately, you knew
where to find something

00:40:50,883 --> 00:40:52,852
a little stronger
than Zolpidem?

00:40:53,886 --> 00:40:57,190
It was important
that no one suffered.

00:40:57,256 --> 00:40:59,425
Ty Bentley suffered.

00:40:59,492 --> 00:41:02,395
That was unfortunate.

00:41:02,462 --> 00:41:05,598
<i>Ty must've followed Diamond</i>
<i>back to our compound.</i>

00:41:05,665 --> 00:41:09,969
<i>I'm sure he was looking</i>
<i>for his ex-girlfriend, Emma.</i>

00:41:10,036 --> 00:41:11,337
These people are freaks, Emma!

00:41:11,404 --> 00:41:12,171
You're coming with me!

00:41:12,238 --> 00:41:13,439
This is my family now.

00:41:15,174 --> 00:41:18,644
Fine. I'm coming back, and I'm
bringing the cops with me.

00:41:24,083 --> 00:41:26,352
( <i>screaming</i> )

00:41:26,419 --> 00:41:29,022
Emma lost it,
said we couldn't

00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:31,290
leave his body there.

00:41:31,357 --> 00:41:33,526
The others started
to get restless.

00:41:33,593 --> 00:41:34,527
And as you said,

00:41:34,594 --> 00:41:35,528
you were on a schedule.

00:41:35,595 --> 00:41:38,231
The peak of the meteor shower
was 3:00 a.m.

00:41:41,701 --> 00:41:45,471
We agreed to dump the body
where it would be found...

00:41:45,538 --> 00:41:47,807
given a decent burial.

00:41:47,874 --> 00:41:49,308
And then you went back

00:41:49,375 --> 00:41:51,644
to the compound...

00:41:51,711 --> 00:41:53,312
and you used the funnel

00:41:53,379 --> 00:41:55,715
to distribute the Ketamine
and vodka.

00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:10,663
I had to be the last to drink.

00:42:11,698 --> 00:42:14,767
Did you watch them all die?

00:42:16,336 --> 00:42:18,905
What was it like?

00:42:20,973 --> 00:42:23,576
( <i>coughs</i> )

00:42:46,132 --> 00:42:49,202
They just died.

00:42:49,268 --> 00:42:52,305
And you went home
to your mother.

00:42:52,372 --> 00:42:55,575
I know they're all up there...

00:42:55,641 --> 00:43:00,480
happy... healthy... perfect.

00:43:05,818 --> 00:43:10,023
You don't believe we're alone
in the universe?

00:43:10,089 --> 00:43:13,059
Abigail...

00:43:13,126 --> 00:43:15,895
I'm sure if there is something
out there

00:43:15,962 --> 00:43:17,263
looking down on us

00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:19,699
from somewhere else
in the universe,

00:43:19,766 --> 00:43:23,880
they're wise enough
to stay away from us.
