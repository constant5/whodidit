All I did
was ask him...

00:10:13,507 --> 00:10:14,775
How'd things go
with Ecklie?

I'll go and talk to him.

00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,182
No, don't talk to him.

what your car was doing

00:10:50,177 --> 00:10:51,945
You know, I had
my first five-some that night.

00:10:52,012 --> 00:10:54,214
And there wasn't no

00:10:54,281 --> 00:10:56,116
You could believe that.

00:10:56,183 --> 00:10:58,585
I'm happy for you, man.

00:10:58,652 --> 00:11:01,321
So, what, are you pinning
this rap on Grandpa?

00:11:01,388 --> 00:11:04,258
Yo, man, my grandpa was
a gangster back in the day.

00:11:04,324 --> 00:11:05,759
You'd be surprised.

00:11:05,826 --> 00:11:08,428
Yeah, I'm really not surprised
by much anymore.

to go with every gun.

00:11:17,671 --> 00:11:20,274

And Morris Calvin
was there.

Yeah, but we don't have
a murder weapon

00:15:40,067 --> 00:15:42,236
so we can't confirm Morris
was the shooter.

00:15:42,302 --> 00:15:44,605
There's a ton of
unknown prints on the car.

00:15:45,906 --> 00:15:47,174

If we could ID the vics,

00:15:48,976 --> 00:15:50,544
it might tell us
who'd want them dead.

Standard procedure
for a drive-by

00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:56,383
is shoot as much as you can
as fast as you can, right?

00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:57,918
Then leave as fast as you can.

00:15:57,985 --> 00:16:01,255
So why did Morris
get out of the car?

00:16:01,321 --> 00:16:03,090
Maybe the vics
had something he wanted.

00:16:03,156 --> 00:16:04,525
The only thing the
victims on the ground had

00:16:04,591 --> 00:16:06,760
on them were the clothes
on their back.

And tox panels on them
all came back negative.

00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:18,539

Are you suggesting that they
were killed for their posters?

00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:29,616
Maybe for what was on them.

00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:36,393
Hey, Jim, check it out.

00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,551
Hitting on 21.

00:21:38,618 --> 00:21:40,787
Looks a lot different,
doesn't he, all pimped out?

00:21:40,854 --> 00:21:42,355
Yeah. Don't kid yourself.

00:21:42,422 --> 00:21:43,990
He's getting pimped
in that video.

00:21:44,057 --> 00:21:46,059
Excuse me, but if
Mr. Dollar's not here,

00:21:46,126 --> 00:21:49,662
you're going to
have to leave.

00:21:49,729 --> 00:21:51,564
We haven't even checked
under the bed yet.

00:21:51,631 --> 00:21:53,600
Yeah, and
what's with

00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:55,301
all the boxes, clothes?

00:21:55,368 --> 00:21:56,569
It's MAGIC.

00:21:56,636 --> 00:21:58,405
BRASS:
You know,
for a concierge, you're not

00:21:58,471 --> 00:21:59,572
really very helpful.

00:21:59,639 --> 00:22:00,807
It's a convention, sir.

00:22:00,874 --> 00:22:03,276
MAGIC-- Men's Apparel Guild
In California.

00:22:03,343 --> 00:22:05,078
It's the largest fashion show
in the world.

00:22:05,145 --> 00:22:06,713
With every rapper,
there's a clothing line.

00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:07,914
They all
come to MAGIC

00:22:07,981 --> 00:22:08,915
to promote it.

00:22:08,982 --> 00:22:10,250
Biggest party in town.

00:22:10,316 --> 00:22:11,251
Hmm.

00:22:11,317 --> 00:22:13,253
So what kind of car
did he drive?

00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:17,123
Um, sir, his vehicle's
still in valet.

00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,462
There it is right there.

00:22:22,529 --> 00:22:24,164
Yeah, is that it?

00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:26,499
It's the only one with
22-inch rims; it's got to be.

00:22:31,037 --> 00:22:32,472
BRASS:
What's that?

00:22:32,539 --> 00:22:33,840
Open this up.

00:22:45,051 --> 00:22:47,320
( <i>groaning</i> )

00:22:48,788 --> 00:22:51,024
Where we at, man?

00:22:51,091 --> 00:22:53,159
You're outside your hotel, sir.

00:22:53,226 --> 00:22:54,961
Don't worry, we're gonna
get you out of there

00:22:55,028 --> 00:22:55,962
and get you
medical attention.

00:22:56,029 --> 00:22:58,298
Man, is you crazy?
Look what I got on.

00:22:58,365 --> 00:23:00,200
I got all these

00:23:00,266 --> 00:23:02,001
people around here, the press.

00:23:02,068 --> 00:23:04,704
Man, let me know when
we get to the hospital, man.

00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,208
He's got a point.

00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:12,853
My prints? The hell
you want my prints for?

00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:15,822
I'm the guy that was forced
to wear the bikini, remember?

00:23:15,889 --> 00:23:18,091
I was in a trunk.
I was in two trunks.

00:23:18,158 --> 00:23:20,527
Three teenagers were killed
on Convention Center Drive.

00:23:20,594 --> 00:23:22,396
They were shot down
putting up posters of you.

00:23:22,462 --> 00:23:25,098
Man, there's posters
of me all over town.

00:23:25,165 --> 00:23:26,333
Got a record coming out.

00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,502
I know.
I like the album cover.

00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:32,005
DOLLAR:
Where'd you get that?

00:23:32,072 --> 00:23:34,808
Like you said,
they're all over town.

00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:37,911
We need your prints so that
we may exclude you as a suspect.

00:23:37,978 --> 00:23:39,813
Yeah, right.

00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,748
Go ahead, take my prints.

00:23:41,815 --> 00:23:43,884
So what's the story
with the video?

00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:46,520
Man, I left
the Sean John party, swerving.

00:23:46,586 --> 00:23:50,390
Big bubble butt on one hand,
bottle in the other.

00:23:50,457 --> 00:23:52,292
Went back to the room
and I passed out

00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:53,960
before I could even
get my lay on.

00:23:54,027 --> 00:23:56,430
When I woke up,
I had a gun and a video camera

00:23:56,496 --> 00:23:57,597
shoved in my face.

00:23:57,664 --> 00:23:59,733
Y'all know where that ended up.

00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,569
Next thing I know, I'm in
my luggage with a fat-ass lip.

00:24:02,636 --> 00:24:03,870
BRASS:
What'd the guy
look like?

00:24:03,937 --> 00:24:06,239
I don't know.
He had on a mask.

00:24:06,306 --> 00:24:07,908
Anyone following you
at the time?

00:24:07,974 --> 00:24:10,343
Man, I was so blunted
and liquored up,

00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:11,445
I have no idea.

00:24:12,979 --> 00:24:14,247
DOLLAR:
Yo.

00:24:14,314 --> 00:24:16,683
Listen, man, y'all find out
who did this for me,

00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,752
like, I'm telling you, like,
I'll take care of you.

00:24:18,819 --> 00:24:20,587
I'll give you a whole
new closet full of suits.

00:24:20,654 --> 00:24:21,722
Like, whatever you want.

00:24:21,788 --> 00:24:23,924
Like, you'll be popping tags
for over a year.

00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:25,092
Like, you'll be
the freshest cops

00:24:25,158 --> 00:24:26,226
on the street, I swear.

00:24:26,293 --> 00:24:28,061
Why would somebody
want to do this to you?

00:24:28,128 --> 00:24:29,696
Man, why wouldn't they?

00:24:29,763 --> 00:24:33,066
I've been dealing with beef like
this my entire life, you dig?

00:24:33,133 --> 00:24:35,902
I bought my first bulletproof
vest when I was 15 years old,

00:24:35,969 --> 00:24:37,671
and I wore it to school.

00:24:37,738 --> 00:24:39,139
Them putting me
in that bikini, man,

00:24:39,206 --> 00:24:40,741
that poster ain't nothing, man.

00:24:40,807 --> 00:24:42,576
I'm lucky to be alive.

00:24:42,642 --> 00:24:44,644
STOKES:
Okay, look,

00:24:44,711 --> 00:24:46,146
why "Dudes Gone Nutz"?

00:24:46,213 --> 00:24:47,581
I don't know, man.

00:24:47,647 --> 00:24:51,451
I did some guest spots on the
little "Chicks Gone Nutz" video.

00:24:51,518 --> 00:24:53,153
You know, the girls
flash their thing things.

00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,489
Dudes just jealous, man.

00:24:55,555 --> 00:24:57,391
I dodge haters for a living.

00:24:57,457 --> 00:24:59,993
I got more enemies than
some countries got people.

00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,361
Give us some names.

00:25:03,397 --> 00:25:04,798
It'll be a long list.

00:25:04,865 --> 00:25:08,402
Griss, we are not
having any luck

00:25:08,468 --> 00:25:10,904
identifying the three
teenagers from CC Drive.

00:25:10,971 --> 00:25:12,739
It's been two days,
no one's come forward.

00:25:12,806 --> 00:25:15,242
Without an ID, it's like
they never even existed.

00:25:15,308 --> 00:25:17,377
We need to get their
faces out in the public--

00:25:17,444 --> 00:25:19,413
newspapers, billboards.

00:25:19,479 --> 00:25:20,881
Well, maybe
you could breathe

00:25:20,947 --> 00:25:23,183
a little bit more
life into them.

00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:26,219
Yeah. I'm pretty good
at mouth-to-mouth.

00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,062
KENDRIC:
Gentra just loved
the hip-hop music.

00:26:42,129 --> 00:26:46,266
And it kept her
out on the streets.

00:26:46,333 --> 00:26:49,369
She actually wanted to
be a rapper herself.

00:26:49,436 --> 00:26:52,205
She did a couple
of talent shows.

00:26:52,272 --> 00:26:54,641
Didn't do too well.

00:26:54,708 --> 00:26:58,045
So she joined
a street team.

00:26:58,111 --> 00:26:59,212
A street team?

00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:02,282
Groups of kids who
hit the streets

00:27:02,349 --> 00:27:04,084
to promote their
favorite rapper.

00:27:07,621 --> 00:27:09,489
It kept Gentra
around what she loved.

00:27:09,556 --> 00:27:10,924
Do you know which rapper
she worked for?

00:27:10,991 --> 00:27:13,060
Hi-Def.

00:27:13,126 --> 00:27:16,430
That's what he
calls himself.

00:27:16,496 --> 00:27:19,499
The State of Nevada's
willing to pay

00:27:19,566 --> 00:27:23,303
to send your daughter
back to California for burial.

00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:27,174
I couldn't afford
to bury my husband.

00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:31,011
In that case,
she'll be cremated.

00:27:31,078 --> 00:27:33,080
I'll make sure
you get the remains.

00:27:33,146 --> 00:27:36,216
You send her ashes to Hi-Def.

HI-DEF:
Never.

00:29:00,333 --> 00:29:01,702
I have. They're from
our street team.

00:29:01,768 --> 00:29:03,370
They look kind of weird
in those pictures,

00:29:03,437 --> 00:29:04,771
but Ray never smiles.

00:29:04,838 --> 00:29:05,939
They're dead.

00:29:06,006 --> 00:29:07,040
What?

00:29:07,107 --> 00:29:08,075
They've been
gone three days.

00:29:08,141 --> 00:29:09,209
You didn't notice?

00:29:09,276 --> 00:29:11,678
Don't look at me, ma'am.

00:29:11,745 --> 00:29:14,047
I never seen those kids
before ever, sorry.

00:29:14,114 --> 00:29:16,583
Look, we've got kids
coming and going all the time.

00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:18,085
It's hard to keep up.

00:29:18,151 --> 00:29:20,554
I mean, I know who they are;
it's Ray, Marvin and Gentra.

00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,055
Do you know
their last names?

00:29:22,122 --> 00:29:23,724
No, I'm sorry.

00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:27,127
Well, do you know
where they got this?

00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,800
Probably the same place
I got this.

00:29:43,877 --> 00:29:46,346
Hey, guys.

00:29:46,413 --> 00:29:47,647
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
How you doing?

00:29:47,714 --> 00:29:50,384
Let me get
one of those for you.

00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:51,918
Here you go.

00:29:51,985 --> 00:29:53,620
No, thanks, man,
I'm all set.

00:29:53,687 --> 00:29:54,921
You know, personally,

00:29:54,988 --> 00:29:56,990
I think it's a bad idea
to hit on blackjack.

00:29:57,057 --> 00:29:59,626
Well, you know,
that's just how we do.

00:29:59,693 --> 00:30:00,627
We never bust.

00:30:00,694 --> 00:30:02,963
I know all about Dollar.

00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:04,898
What's your
connection?

00:30:04,965 --> 00:30:06,133
Are you a cop?

00:30:06,199 --> 00:30:07,434
I work with
the police department, yeah.

00:30:07,501 --> 00:30:10,470
Crime lab. My
name's Nick Stokes.

00:30:10,537 --> 00:30:13,940
Drops. And let's just say
Dollar pays the bills.

00:30:14,007 --> 00:30:15,609
The video just showed up
on my desk.

00:30:15,675 --> 00:30:16,910
First day
of the show.

00:30:16,977 --> 00:30:18,445
It was in a plain
manila envelope.

00:30:18,512 --> 00:30:19,646
So you put it on the net.

00:30:19,713 --> 00:30:22,482
I never said that,
but things happen.

00:30:22,549 --> 00:30:25,385
Did Hi-Def and Dollar
have a beef before this?

00:30:25,452 --> 00:30:26,720
Yeah, a couple
of years ago,

00:30:26,787 --> 00:30:28,722
Dollar did song
called "New Vegas."

00:30:28,789 --> 00:30:31,158
Talking about how Las
Vegas is the new New York.

00:30:31,224 --> 00:30:33,060
Hi-Def is New York.

00:30:33,126 --> 00:30:34,995
He and Dollar been punking
each other ever since.

00:30:36,697 --> 00:30:38,198
What's the deal with
these street teams.

00:30:38,265 --> 00:30:39,800
What's going on?

00:30:39,866 --> 00:30:42,602
DROPS:
They do all the filthy,
dirty, grimy promo for Dollar.

00:30:42,669 --> 00:30:45,372
Snipe posters, give away
stickers, pass CDs around.

00:30:45,439 --> 00:30:46,573
Nothing new.

00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,208
You know, three kids
were murdered

00:30:48,275 --> 00:30:50,577
the other night doing
the exact same thing.

00:30:50,644 --> 00:30:52,079
What can I say, man?

00:30:52,145 --> 00:30:53,547
These kids run the streets, bro.

00:30:53,613 --> 00:30:56,216
Anybody at any given time
can run up on them

00:30:56,283 --> 00:30:57,484
and try and lullaby their ass.

00:30:57,551 --> 00:30:58,752
Yeah, I don't know about that.

00:30:58,819 --> 00:31:00,821
They were putting up posters
of your boy Dollar--

00:31:00,887 --> 00:31:02,823
ones that made him
look a lot stupider

00:31:02,889 --> 00:31:04,758
than just hitting on blackjack,
you know what I mean?

00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,762
Take a look
at these kids.

00:31:08,829 --> 00:31:11,798
See if you recognize
any of them.

00:31:11,865 --> 00:31:13,567
Nope.

00:31:13,633 --> 00:31:14,768
Show them.

00:31:19,406 --> 00:31:21,508
Nice suit.

00:31:21,575 --> 00:31:22,509
Glad to see

00:31:22,576 --> 00:31:26,012
you dressed
for the occasion.

00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:27,547
No.

00:31:27,614 --> 00:31:30,717
Eh, sorry, Crime Lab,
Nick Stokes.

00:31:30,784 --> 00:31:32,185
Nobody here's got a clue.

00:31:32,252 --> 00:31:35,489
Yeah, okay.

00:31:35,555 --> 00:31:37,057
Yeah, okay.

00:31:37,124 --> 00:31:39,026
Oh, well, what do you know?

00:31:39,092 --> 00:31:40,560
There goes one of my birds.

00:31:40,627 --> 00:31:41,895
Sorry, got to go.

00:31:41,962 --> 00:31:43,597
Peace.

00:31:43,663 --> 00:31:45,065
I'll see you
soon, dawg.

00:31:45,132 --> 00:31:47,000
Yeah, whatever.

00:31:47,067 --> 00:31:49,903
Look, you need any more posters,
just scream at me.

00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:50,917
Hey, Tweety!

00:31:51,001 --> 00:31:53,137
Tweety!

00:32:09,375 --> 00:32:10,776
Hey.
Hey.

00:32:10,843 --> 00:32:12,959
Mandy matched two prints
off the photo

00:32:12,959 --> 00:32:14,360
that you gave to Dollar's
street team

00:32:14,427 --> 00:32:16,625
to the unknowns that I found
in the low rider.
Mm-hmm.

00:32:16,625 --> 00:32:17,993
One was
on the passenger side door,

00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:20,696
the other one was
on the steering wheel.

00:32:20,763 --> 00:32:22,665
Hey, yo, yo, yo,
make sure you tell him

00:32:22,731 --> 00:32:26,001
about that crazy new suit line
we got coming out.

00:32:26,068 --> 00:32:27,069
( <i>Drops speaking Japanese</i> )

00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:28,304
Now what?

00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:30,039
I'm here for Drops.

00:32:30,105 --> 00:32:31,473
Hang up.

No kidding?

00:32:39,281 --> 00:32:40,749
Where's your
street team?

00:32:40,816 --> 00:32:43,252
They're grubbing-- they went
down to the Cafe Hospital.

00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:46,422
You know, they're kind of
Benigni over that Waldorf salad.

( <i>chuckling</i> )

I didn't shoot nobody.

00:33:16,785 --> 00:33:21,357
Please, you got
to believe me.

00:33:21,423 --> 00:33:24,026
I just wanted to
drive that car.

00:33:24,093 --> 00:33:26,095
Morris was always
bragging about it.

00:33:26,161 --> 00:33:28,964
I'll believe you if you tell me
what really happened.

00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,936
I was picking up an order
for Drops.

00:33:34,003 --> 00:33:37,439
I saw that poster
on the wall.

00:33:37,506 --> 00:33:41,043
I just told the other guys
what I saw.

00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:43,045
Look, I know I shouldn't
have done that,

00:33:43,112 --> 00:33:46,582
'cause as soon as I
did, Morris wanted
to see the poster.

00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:48,517
Morris would do anything
for Dollar.

00:33:48,584 --> 00:33:50,786
You know, Dollar's his life.

00:33:50,853 --> 00:33:53,956
He only has Dollar
in his iPod.

00:33:54,023 --> 00:33:55,658
No one else.

00:33:55,724 --> 00:33:58,327
So then you went to CC Drive.

00:33:58,394 --> 00:34:01,030
Yeah.

00:34:01,096 --> 00:34:03,132

High-def street team.

00:34:10,306 --> 00:34:13,609

Morris, hurry up, man--

00:34:17,313 --> 00:34:18,947
you just said
you were gonna scare them.
Nah, man.

00:34:19,014 --> 00:34:20,816
that poster makes Dollar
look like a ho.

00:34:20,883 --> 00:34:22,751

I was just riding shotgun,
watching Morris.

00:35:03,859 --> 00:35:05,794
You didn't do
anything about it?

00:35:05,861 --> 00:35:07,296
He was out of his mind.

00:35:07,363 --> 00:35:09,164
Where did Morris
get the gun?

00:35:09,231 --> 00:35:10,899
It was in the trunk.

00:35:10,966 --> 00:35:13,836
He said his brother swiped it
off some dumb-ass cop.

00:35:13,902 --> 00:35:14,870
Where is it now?

00:35:14,937 --> 00:35:16,672
Broken apart and thrown away.

I figure Dante
had that revolver

00:36:33,415 --> 00:36:35,351
when he was going up
and down those poles.

made the video.

You said Dante
works for Dollar.

Mm-hmm.
He's a fan.

00:36:49,098 --> 00:36:51,734
Why would he humiliate
someone he respects?

I don't know.

I don't know, but on the video,

00:36:58,407 --> 00:37:01,644
Dante did say,
"Who's the bitch now?"

About a year ago,
during Black Spring Break,

Dollar caught me walking
through the MGM.

00:39:09,371 --> 00:39:11,373
He was hosting
this <i>Chicks Gone Nuts</i> video.

00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,509
Said he'd give me $500
to put on a bikini

00:39:13,575 --> 00:39:16,045

00:39:16,111 --> 00:39:19,548
I needed the money...

I got my money and went home.
