They met at a church social

Christina complained he wasn't
very Christian-like.

But that was part of
the attraction, if you ask me.

00:07:00,118 --> 00:07:03,654
He was older.
Didn't want to get married.

00:07:03,721 --> 00:07:07,859
You know, Christina never said
he was the father.

00:07:07,925 --> 00:07:09,660
So there were other guys?

00:07:09,727 --> 00:07:13,665
No. As far as I knew,
Christina was a prude.

00:07:13,731 --> 00:07:16,701
She'd turn red if somebody told
a dirty joke.

00:07:16,768 --> 00:07:19,103

Preston Breckman
who's on trial

00:08:21,099 --> 00:08:22,600

of Joanna Whitson.

00:08:22,667 --> 00:08:24,202

She was a friend of yours.
I'm sorry.

00:08:26,204 --> 00:08:28,973
I was her godfather.
Grew up with her dad.

Two weeks before
she was murdered

00:08:30,641 --> 00:08:32,477
I gave a toast
at her sweet 16.

00:08:32,543 --> 00:08:34,078
Well, they say
it's a slam dunk case.

00:08:34,145 --> 00:08:35,580
You would think.
We've got an eyewitness

00:08:35,646 --> 00:08:36,948
who saw him stab her.

00:08:37,015 --> 00:08:39,684
Hair, fiber, even DNA
from the killer's tobacco

00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:42,420
We got the right guy.

00:08:42,487 --> 00:08:43,588
Then what am I doing here?

00:08:43,654 --> 00:08:46,691
Defense has called
entomologist Mark Thayer

00:08:46,758 --> 00:08:48,493
as an expert witness.

00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:49,761
He's a gun for hire.

00:08:49,827 --> 00:08:51,996
He's gonna say that the
insect activity on the body

00:08:52,063 --> 00:08:54,799
proves defendant was out of town
at the time of the murder.

00:08:54,866 --> 00:08:57,669
And you want me to refute
his testimony?

00:08:59,237 --> 00:09:00,304
When does he take the stand?

00:09:00,371 --> 00:09:02,373
Half an hour.

00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,642
Look, he's been on the list,

00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:07,679
but the D.A. assured me
he was unavailable.

00:09:07,745 --> 00:09:09,681
Gil, we need you to listen
to his testimony.

00:09:09,747 --> 00:09:13,351
Prosecution may need
your assistance on cross.

00:09:13,418 --> 00:09:14,986
I'll do my best.

00:09:15,053 --> 00:09:17,188
No mystery here.

00:09:17,255 --> 00:09:18,623
Penetrating gunshot wound
to the right temple

00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:19,891
killed our Virgin Mary.

00:09:19,957 --> 00:09:21,559
I sent the bullet
to ballistics.

00:09:21,626 --> 00:09:23,828
Virgin Mary?

00:09:23,895 --> 00:09:27,565
Hymen's intact which means
she's never had intercourse.

00:09:27,632 --> 00:09:31,169
But she gave birth...
caesarean scar.

00:09:31,235 --> 00:09:33,204
So other than
divine intervention,

00:09:33,271 --> 00:09:36,174
how do you explain
this miraculous conception?

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,177
Well, the most obvious
explanation would be frottage.

00:09:39,243 --> 00:09:40,411
You mean dry humping?

00:09:40,478 --> 00:09:41,813
In Sex Ed,

00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:44,248
Nick, they teach that
rubbing body parts is safe.

00:09:44,315 --> 00:09:47,185
But since the hymen's
not a barrier to semen,

00:09:47,251 --> 00:09:48,820
there's still a risk
of pregnancy,

00:09:48,886 --> 00:09:50,388
not to mention STDs.

00:09:50,455 --> 00:09:53,057
Right. Sperm meets labia,
all bets are off.

00:09:53,124 --> 00:09:55,259
It's all about gravity.

00:09:55,326 --> 00:09:57,228
Thanks, Dr. Ruth.

00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:02,033
The test fire bullet matches
the evidence bullet.

00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,370
That confirms the gun found
at the scene was used to kill

00:10:05,436 --> 00:10:08,873
this, uh...
Christina Adalian.

00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,274
You run the serial number?

00:10:10,341 --> 00:10:11,576
Yeah, of course.

00:10:11,642 --> 00:10:13,845
Anyway, Greg,
your two-inch Colt

was originally purchased
in 1986

00:10:16,481 --> 00:10:20,852
by a Mr. Duane McWane
from Henderson.

00:10:20,918 --> 00:10:22,220
Good luck.

00:10:22,286 --> 00:10:23,855
Thanks.

00:10:23,921 --> 00:10:26,591
Well, as you can see, the life
cycle of the black blow fly,

00:10:26,657 --> 00:10:29,027
from egg to larva to puparium
to adult,

00:10:29,093 --> 00:10:30,628
is like clockwork.

00:10:30,695 --> 00:10:33,998
So, to be clear, we can use
the fly's lifecycle

00:10:34,065 --> 00:10:35,633
to accurately determine
the precise day

00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,768
the victim was killed.

00:10:36,834 --> 00:10:38,136
That's correct.

00:10:38,202 --> 00:10:41,372
The victim was murdered
in a woodsy area near Lake Mead.

00:10:41,439 --> 00:10:43,641
In that vicinity, how long would
it take for the blow fly

00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:45,309
to lay eggs in Joanna Whitson's
body?

00:10:45,376 --> 00:10:46,711
Within minutes of her death.

00:10:46,778 --> 00:10:47,712
Is that true?

00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:48,980
Mm-hmm.

00:10:49,047 --> 00:10:51,149
Doctor, based on your review
of the blow fly activity

00:10:51,215 --> 00:10:53,685
as documented by CSI,
can you tell this jury

00:10:53,751 --> 00:10:55,086
the exact date Joanna
was murdered?

00:10:55,153 --> 00:10:57,922
THAYER:
CSI found puparia on the body,

00:10:57,989 --> 00:10:59,323
but no adults.

00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:02,093
So that means that the victim
had been dead for 15 days.

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,762
The body was discovered
November 15.

00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:06,431
So based on your analysis,

00:11:06,497 --> 00:11:08,399
the victim was killed
November 1?

00:11:08,466 --> 00:11:09,667
That's correct.

00:11:09,734 --> 00:11:12,236
Defendant was in Mexico
'til November 3.

00:11:12,303 --> 00:11:14,572
We think he killed her
on the 4th.

00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:16,774
Well, he's still got to prove
his timeline.

00:11:16,841 --> 00:11:19,210
Dr. Thayer, this timeline you
suggest-- from egg to puparia,

00:11:19,277 --> 00:11:20,278
has this been documented?

00:11:20,345 --> 00:11:22,180
I documented it myself.

00:11:22,246 --> 00:11:24,882
In fact, in preparation
for this trial,

00:11:24,949 --> 00:11:27,819
I videotaped a black blow fly
breeding on a pig carcass.

00:11:27,885 --> 00:11:31,022
Now, this videotape will
illustrate that the timeline

00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:35,360
from egg to puparium is,
in fact, precisely 15 days.

00:11:37,462 --> 00:11:39,897
Your Honor, on this video tape,

00:11:39,964 --> 00:11:41,566
I have relevant footage

00:11:41,632 --> 00:11:43,267
of Dr. Thayer's experiment.
With your permission,

00:11:43,334 --> 00:11:45,003
I'd like to play it
for the jury.
Have you seen this tape?

00:11:45,069 --> 00:11:46,170
No. Objection.

00:11:46,237 --> 00:11:48,840
Your Honor, the defense
never produced that tape

00:11:48,906 --> 00:11:50,274
for our review.

00:11:50,341 --> 00:11:52,844
We haven't had the opportunity
to examine its authenticity.

00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,479
It's not our fault.
It was never requested.

00:11:54,545 --> 00:11:56,080
Is that true, Counselor?

00:11:56,147 --> 00:11:57,415
The defense is playing games,
Your Honor.

00:11:57,482 --> 00:11:59,517
We subpoenaed the expert's
files, reports

00:11:59,584 --> 00:12:00,785
and opinions.

00:12:00,852 --> 00:12:02,420
But, apparently,
they've conveniently

00:12:02,487 --> 00:12:04,355
construed the subpoena
too narrowly.

00:12:04,422 --> 00:12:06,290
They're acting
in bad faith, Your Honor,

00:12:06,357 --> 00:12:07,959
and cannot expect
this court to usurp...

00:12:08,026 --> 00:12:09,660
Your Honor, Your Honor.
If I may...

00:12:09,727 --> 00:12:10,728
You may not.

00:12:10,795 --> 00:12:12,230
You blindsided the court.

00:12:12,296 --> 00:12:14,799
You knew that the ADA.
would want to see that tape

00:12:14,866 --> 00:12:16,868
and you deliberately
withheld it.

00:12:16,934 --> 00:12:18,636
How much time do you need?

00:12:18,703 --> 00:12:20,405
We won't know
until we review the video.

00:12:20,471 --> 00:12:21,673
Fine.

00:12:21,739 --> 00:12:23,307
The defense
is to hand over the tape

00:12:23,374 --> 00:12:25,877
and all associated evidence.

00:12:25,943 --> 00:12:28,346
The jury is dismissed
until 1:00 p.m. tomorrow.

00:12:28,413 --> 00:12:30,214
( <i>gavel bangs</i> )

Send everything
over to the lab.

00:12:32,483 --> 00:12:33,885
I'll be there.

00:12:40,542 --> 00:12:42,010
<i>Your black-and-white particles</i>

00:12:42,077 --> 00:12:43,978
were composed
of plagioclase,

biotite, hornblende
and pyroxene.

00:12:47,983 --> 00:12:49,484
Diorite granite.

00:12:49,551 --> 00:12:51,319
You remember your geology.

00:12:51,386 --> 00:12:52,854
Yes!
Wow.

00:12:52,921 --> 00:12:56,658
Actually, senior year
I took "Rocks For Jocks."

00:12:56,725 --> 00:12:58,093
I dated the TA.

00:12:59,394 --> 00:13:00,028
Lucky guy.

00:13:00,095 --> 00:13:01,830
I'm sure you got an "A."

00:13:01,896 --> 00:13:03,765
As a matter of fact, I did.

00:13:03,832 --> 00:13:05,367
Mm-hmm.

00:13:05,433 --> 00:13:06,234
You're married?

00:13:07,302 --> 00:13:08,403
Don't flirt.

00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:11,106
Anyway, uh, diorite
granite is used

00:13:11,172 --> 00:13:13,141
in high end bathroom
vanities.

00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:16,111
Was there any recent
construction at the house?

00:13:16,177 --> 00:13:18,246
No, I processed the bathroom
and the countertops

00:13:18,313 --> 00:13:19,781
for some kind
of plastic laminate.

00:13:19,848 --> 00:13:21,282
Made a few calls.

00:13:21,349 --> 00:13:22,917
There's only one

00:13:22,984 --> 00:13:24,252
slab yard in Clark County

00:13:24,319 --> 00:13:25,620
that works
with Diorite.

It's on Alonzo Avenue
across the street

00:13:27,756 --> 00:13:30,325
from the old theater.

Hey, take it easy
with that Thassos.

00:13:35,196 --> 00:13:36,965
It's the last shipment
of the month.

00:13:37,032 --> 00:13:38,767
Sorry about that.

00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,602
Sure, I know Christina.

00:13:40,669 --> 00:13:41,903
Dated one of my guys.

00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:43,304
Real sweet gal.

00:13:43,371 --> 00:13:46,141
Used to bring donuts around
before they broke up.

to be working today?

00:13:49,844 --> 00:13:51,146
Yep.

His name's Evan.

( <i>grinding</i> )

00:14:01,356 --> 00:14:03,725
Well, I'm sorry
to hear about Christina,

00:14:03,792 --> 00:14:05,493
but we broke it off months ago.
I haven't seen her since.

00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,229
WARRICK:
Really?

00:14:08,296 --> 00:14:10,298
Is she dating one
of your co-workers?

00:14:10,365 --> 00:14:11,733
Huh?

00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,903
Well, we found marble particles
in her house

00:14:14,969 --> 00:14:16,738
and we identified the stone.

00:14:16,805 --> 00:14:18,807
It came from this facility.

00:14:18,873 --> 00:14:21,609
See, Mr. Peters,

00:14:21,676 --> 00:14:24,079
we know that you
and Christina

00:14:24,145 --> 00:14:25,680
technically never
had sex,

00:14:25,747 --> 00:14:26,915
so when you found out
that she was pregnant,

00:14:26,982 --> 00:14:28,016
I'm guessing that

00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:30,085
you felt that she
cheated on you.

00:14:30,151 --> 00:14:32,854
How in the hell do you know
about my sex life?

00:14:32,921 --> 00:14:34,990
I mean, that had to have made
you really angry, right?

00:14:35,056 --> 00:14:36,992
Well, that's why I dumped her.

00:14:38,927 --> 00:14:43,198
And fine, I saw her
a couple of days ago.

00:14:43,264 --> 00:14:46,301
She called me
in a panic.

00:14:46,368 --> 00:14:48,937
Dingbat had locked herself out

00:14:49,004 --> 00:14:51,373
with her damn baby
still inside the house.

00:14:51,439 --> 00:14:53,641
Thought I had
her spare key.
I didn't.

00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:57,312
She sounded hysterical,
so I went over to help.

00:14:57,379 --> 00:14:59,180

Well, she wanted to talk.

00:15:11,026 --> 00:15:12,027
What did
you talk about?

00:15:12,093 --> 00:15:15,230
All right, get this.

00:15:15,296 --> 00:15:21,369
She tried to tell me
that God got her pregnant.

me an apology

'cause she was
my girlfriend.

He should have
asked me first.

00:15:27,709 --> 00:15:29,377
Why did you lie to us?

00:15:29,444 --> 00:15:31,379
Claim that you hadn't seen
her in months?

00:15:31,446 --> 00:15:33,982
Well, you guys were
investigating her murder,

00:15:34,049 --> 00:15:36,184
and I want to stay out of it.

00:15:36,251 --> 00:15:38,887
Well, it's too late
for that, my friend.

00:15:38,953 --> 00:15:41,089
We need your DNA.

Open wide.

00:15:47,395 --> 00:15:49,431
The day I got married,
I got rid of my gun.

00:15:49,497 --> 00:15:51,299
The wife didn't
want it in the house.

00:15:51,366 --> 00:15:52,734
You sell it?

00:15:52,801 --> 00:15:54,536
No, I gave it
to my paralegal.

00:15:54,602 --> 00:15:55,970
I'm an attorney.

00:15:56,037 --> 00:15:57,706
Look, it's just a handgun,

00:15:57,772 --> 00:16:00,141
so I wasn't required
to register the transfer.

00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:01,576
What's your paralegal's name?

00:16:01,643 --> 00:16:03,445
Rita Day.

00:16:03,511 --> 00:16:04,913
She left the firm
years ago.

00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,549
She's a paramedic now
at Emergency Care Ambulance.

00:16:07,615 --> 00:16:09,351
You still keep
in touch with her?

00:16:09,417 --> 00:16:10,885
I get a card
every Christmas.

Look, just, just
so you know,

00:16:14,956 --> 00:16:17,425
she only got that gun
for her own protection.

00:16:17,492 --> 00:16:20,595

How is it going?

00:17:06,141 --> 00:17:08,043
Well, according
to <i>my</i> experience

00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:10,045
and all three of
these textbooks,

00:17:10,111 --> 00:17:14,115
the <i>P. Regina</i> would develop
from egg to puparium in 11 days.

00:17:14,182 --> 00:17:15,250
Great.

00:17:15,317 --> 00:17:16,885
That discounts
Thayer's testimony

00:17:16,951 --> 00:17:19,154
and puts Breckman in Vegas
at the time of the homicide.

00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:22,390
Yeah, but his demonstration
speaks for itself.

00:17:22,457 --> 00:17:27,195
There's no visible puparia for
15 days, just as Thayer asserts.

00:17:27,262 --> 00:17:28,463
And jurors might
be more receptive

00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:30,598
to video documentation
than books.

00:17:30,665 --> 00:17:33,068
The science
in these textbooks is sound,

00:17:33,134 --> 00:17:37,339
but the <i>tape</i> is more than enough
to get reasonable doubt.

00:17:37,405 --> 00:17:38,807
Well, there's
no doubt in my mind

00:17:38,873 --> 00:17:39,841
that Thayer worked his science

00:17:39,908 --> 00:17:41,343
to get the answers
the defense needed.

00:17:41,409 --> 00:17:43,311
We just need to know
how he did it.

00:17:43,378 --> 00:17:45,947
Could he have altered
one of the variables?

00:17:46,014 --> 00:17:47,082
I've reviewed his documentation.

00:17:47,148 --> 00:17:49,084
He purchased the pig
from a reputable dealer.

00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,885
He conducted the experiment
at a private lab

00:17:50,952 --> 00:17:53,288
with eyewitnesses,
controlled <i>all</i> variables

00:17:53,355 --> 00:17:54,789
to replicate the
conditions at Lake Mead

00:17:54,856 --> 00:17:56,424
during the time in question.

00:17:56,491 --> 00:17:58,093
65 to 73 degrees,

00:17:58,159 --> 00:17:59,995
no precipitation,
on and on.

00:18:00,061 --> 00:18:01,730
Can you conduct
your own experiment?

00:18:01,796 --> 00:18:04,199
Sure, if the judge
will give me 11 days.

00:18:04,265 --> 00:18:05,700
Well, we know
that's not gonna happen.

00:18:05,767 --> 00:18:07,702
I'll have Archie
review the video footage.

00:18:07,769 --> 00:18:11,239
Maybe he messed
with the time code or something.

00:18:11,306 --> 00:18:12,307
I'll let you know.

00:18:12,374 --> 00:18:16,478
So I heard that my predecessor
in DNA had all these

00:18:16,544 --> 00:18:19,214

personal hygiene issues.

00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,182
Well, just for the record,
I'm not like that.

00:18:21,249 --> 00:18:23,652
I have always been
very touchy-feely.

00:18:23,718 --> 00:18:26,321
I mean, I used to work in
San Francisco, you know.

00:18:26,388 --> 00:18:29,057
So... every day we
started with hugs.

00:18:29,124 --> 00:18:30,392
Uh-huh. Yeah.

00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:32,727
That must've been
nice for you. So...

00:18:32,794 --> 00:18:34,062
Hey, how about
lunch tomorrow?

00:18:34,129 --> 00:18:35,397
Just you and me.

00:18:35,463 --> 00:18:37,165
Cause, see, I-I figure
that you gotta know

00:18:37,232 --> 00:18:38,800
where the bodies are
buried around here.

00:18:39,801 --> 00:18:41,236
So to speak.

00:18:41,302 --> 00:18:43,171
Is that why you paged me?

00:18:43,238 --> 00:18:45,707
No. No, um...I compared

00:18:45,774 --> 00:18:50,078
Christina Adalian's DNA
to Baby Joey's, and guess what?

00:18:50,145 --> 00:18:52,080
Mother and son--
they're not mother and son.

00:18:52,147 --> 00:18:54,082
At least not
genetically speaking.

00:18:54,149 --> 00:18:55,383
There's no relation.

00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:57,285
And Evan Peters
isn't the father?

00:18:57,352 --> 00:18:58,553
Nope.

00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:01,323
So assuming that there was no
big baby mix-up at the hospital,

00:19:01,389 --> 00:19:03,958
I'm thinking that Christina
Adalian had to be a surrogate.

00:19:05,427 --> 00:19:07,929
Surrogacy...
that would explain her hymen.

00:19:07,996 --> 00:19:09,197
Hello.

00:19:09,264 --> 00:19:10,932
Her hymen was intact,

00:19:10,999 --> 00:19:14,235
which is consistent with
in-vitro fertilization.

00:19:14,302 --> 00:19:15,904
Yeah, but there's one problem.

00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:18,373
A surrogate's not supposed
to keep the baby.

00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,141
The surrogate is supposed to be
a gestational carrier

00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:22,143
who returns the child
to the biological parents

00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:23,812
after it's
been born.

00:19:23,878 --> 00:19:27,215
Yeah, that <i>is</i> a problem.

00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,254
( <i>knocking</i> )

00:19:33,321 --> 00:19:34,289
Hey, Gris.

00:19:34,356 --> 00:19:36,057
I reviewed your videotapes.

00:19:36,124 --> 00:19:39,227
Checked for insertions,
deletions, omissions.

00:19:39,294 --> 00:19:40,261
They're all authentic.

00:19:40,328 --> 00:19:41,830
You're certain?
Oh, yeah.

00:19:41,896 --> 00:19:43,732
I de-interlaced the video,

00:19:43,798 --> 00:19:45,967
checked the head switching,
the HBI-VBI

00:19:46,034 --> 00:19:47,068
looked for in-out signals.

00:19:47,135 --> 00:19:48,303
The tapes are clean.

00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:49,371
Sorry.

00:19:49,437 --> 00:19:50,605
Did you blow up the frames?

00:19:50,672 --> 00:19:51,606
Yeah.

00:19:51,673 --> 00:19:53,008
One every six hours.

00:19:53,074 --> 00:19:54,943
They're in Layout,
when you're ready.
Okay.

00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:55,977
WILLOWS:
Oh, hi, Archie.

00:19:56,044 --> 00:19:57,045
Hey.

00:19:57,645 --> 00:19:59,414
I just finished your eval.

00:19:59,481 --> 00:20:00,815
And?

00:20:00,882 --> 00:20:03,752
In the comments section, I noted
that if you had my job,

00:20:03,818 --> 00:20:05,854
these evaluations
wouldn't be late.

00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,756
Thank you.

00:20:07,822 --> 00:20:11,760
So I understand that you're
going up against Mark Thayer.

00:20:11,826 --> 00:20:13,194
The guy's an ass.

00:20:13,261 --> 00:20:15,630
He used to be a
competent scientist.

00:20:15,697 --> 00:20:18,767
We actually co-authored a paper
together ten years ago.

00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:21,970
I believe greed has
gotten in his way.

00:20:22,037 --> 00:20:23,638
Well, I've seen him
on the stand.

00:20:23,705 --> 00:20:24,973
He manipulates evidence.

00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,741
He manipulates people.

00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:29,778
The public assumes
that scientists are ethical,

00:20:29,844 --> 00:20:32,614
but many of us are no better
than politicians, evidently.

00:20:32,681 --> 00:20:35,116
So do you think that Thayer

00:20:35,183 --> 00:20:37,285
is presenting the jury
with faulty forensics?

00:20:37,352 --> 00:20:40,522
I know he is.
I just don't know how.

00:20:40,588 --> 00:20:43,124
Videotapes are clean.

00:20:43,191 --> 00:20:46,795
The science appears sound.

00:20:46,861 --> 00:20:48,063
How's your case going?

00:20:48,129 --> 00:20:51,132
Huh. I don't know who killed
Christina Adalian,

00:20:51,199 --> 00:20:53,335
I don't know
how she got pregnant

00:20:53,401 --> 00:20:58,073
and I don't know the identity of
the baby's biological parents.

00:20:58,139 --> 00:21:00,475
It's always good to know
what you <i>don't</i> know.

00:21:03,709 --> 00:21:06,211
Sure, I know Duane.
He's a good boss.

00:21:06,917 --> 00:21:08,218
I just hated
being cooped up

00:21:08,285 --> 00:21:09,953
in an office building
all day.

00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,488
He claims he gave
you his gun

00:21:11,555 --> 00:21:12,522
several years back.

00:21:12,589 --> 00:21:14,324
Yeah, sure. Why?

00:21:14,391 --> 00:21:18,161
It was recently used
in a homicide.

00:21:18,228 --> 00:21:19,496
Damn.

00:21:19,563 --> 00:21:21,131
Well, I'm sorry.

00:21:21,198 --> 00:21:24,268
So, the gun's
no longer in
your possession?

00:21:24,334 --> 00:21:26,603
Lost the Colt in a poker game
years ago.

00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:28,038
Do you remember
who you lost it to?

00:21:28,105 --> 00:21:29,573
I was drunk
as a skunk.

00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,341
Met these guys
at a bar.

00:21:31,408 --> 00:21:32,409
Lost a small fortune

00:21:32,476 --> 00:21:33,510
trying to keep up
with their raises.

00:21:33,577 --> 00:21:36,046
Can you tell me anything
about the guy who won the gun?

00:21:36,113 --> 00:21:39,883
Well, he's an older guy,
at least 50.

00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:41,752
I remember guys
were calling him "Cy,"

00:21:41,818 --> 00:21:43,086
but that wasn't
his real name.

00:21:43,153 --> 00:21:44,955
He had this large mole
between his eyes.

00:21:45,022 --> 00:21:47,524
"Cy," short
for "Cyclops"?

00:21:47,591 --> 00:21:49,860
Yeah. I swear I thought
that thing was winking at me.

00:21:49,927 --> 00:21:50,894
Thanks for your help.

00:21:50,961 --> 00:21:51,895
No problem.

00:21:51,962 --> 00:21:54,498
( <i>both chuckle</i> )

00:21:59,169 --> 00:22:00,671
Oh, ducks.

00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:02,272
That's a new decorating choice.

00:22:02,339 --> 00:22:08,178
I now have to share this office
with the day shift supervisor.

00:22:08,245 --> 00:22:11,281
She's got some kind of thing
for waterfowl.

00:22:11,348 --> 00:22:12,583
What's up?

00:22:12,649 --> 00:22:16,920
Warrick and I tracked down
Joey Adalian's birth
certificate.

00:22:16,987 --> 00:22:18,989
Christina's named
as the mother,

00:22:19,056 --> 00:22:20,090
father's unknown.

00:22:20,157 --> 00:22:23,427
We also found another
document in her desk.

00:22:23,493 --> 00:22:25,495
It's a registration form
for an organization

00:22:25,562 --> 00:22:27,130
called Project Sunflower.

00:22:27,197 --> 00:22:29,666
They find mothers
for abandoned embryos.

00:22:29,733 --> 00:22:32,436
Abandoned embryos?

00:22:32,502 --> 00:22:34,438
According to literature,

00:22:34,504 --> 00:22:37,441
Project Sunflower believes that
every fertilized egg or embryo

00:22:37,507 --> 00:22:40,510
is a baby from the moment it's
created in a laboratory dish.

00:22:40,577 --> 00:22:44,114
Fertility clinics
freeze fertilized eggs
for their clients

00:22:44,181 --> 00:22:46,350
undergoing
in-vitro fertilization.

00:22:46,416 --> 00:22:49,786
Often, the clinics freeze more
eggs than they ultimately need.

00:22:49,853 --> 00:22:56,927
And Sunflower tries
to find women willing

00:22:56,994 --> 00:22:59,029
to gestate
and raise the leftovers?

00:22:59,096 --> 00:23:00,998
Uh-huh.

00:23:01,064 --> 00:23:03,800
Project Sunflower promotes
itself as doing God's work.

00:23:03,867 --> 00:23:06,837
I knew a stripper who claimed
the exact same thing.

00:23:08,939 --> 00:23:11,441
So, is there any chance
that you have a record

00:23:11,508 --> 00:23:12,776
of the baby's
biological parents?

00:23:12,843 --> 00:23:16,380
Not yet. But I do have
an address for Sunflower's

00:23:16,446 --> 00:23:18,382
local chapter.

00:23:18,448 --> 00:23:20,717
It's a tragedy.

00:23:20,784 --> 00:23:24,121
There are over 400,000 embryos
currently in cryobank storage

00:23:24,187 --> 00:23:25,756
in the United States.

00:23:25,822 --> 00:23:30,093
Pre-born children
suspended in time.

00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,630
If I understand your program
correctly,

00:23:33,697 --> 00:23:37,067
you take these embryos
and you place them

00:23:37,134 --> 00:23:39,803
in available wombs.

00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:42,572
We seek out special
unselfish women

00:23:42,639 --> 00:23:43,573
who are prepared
to adopt

00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,476
at the embryonic stage
of development.

00:23:46,543 --> 00:23:48,879
We believe that
the soul is infused

00:23:48,946 --> 00:23:50,981
when sperm meets egg.

00:23:51,048 --> 00:23:52,282
That's when life begins.

00:23:52,349 --> 00:23:57,321
Are you aware
that throughout much of history,

00:23:57,387 --> 00:24:00,123
the official church
position held that
a child's life

00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:03,360
begins when the mother
first becomes aware of movement?

00:24:03,427 --> 00:24:05,262
Oh, that's your opinion.

00:24:05,329 --> 00:24:08,165
In the 16th century,
the Pope proclaimed

00:24:08,231 --> 00:24:11,401
that embryos less than 40 days
old are not human.

00:24:11,468 --> 00:24:12,970
That is not my opinion.

00:24:15,105 --> 00:24:16,673
You've had an abortion,
Miss Willows?

00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:20,210
Huh. No. Thank God

00:24:20,277 --> 00:24:22,713
I decided not to
have one.

00:24:22,779 --> 00:24:26,483
But we are not talking about me,
Dr. Ryan.

00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:27,618
Are you a medical doctor?

00:24:27,684 --> 00:24:30,454
I don't care
for that insinuation.

00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,723
Oh, it's just a question.

00:24:32,789 --> 00:24:34,758
I take it
that's a no?

00:24:34,825 --> 00:24:37,527
I have a very busy afternoon.

00:24:37,594 --> 00:24:39,162
What exactly can I do for you?

00:24:39,229 --> 00:24:41,465
I have a question.

00:24:41,531 --> 00:24:45,035
Do the biological parents
get to meet the embryo adopters?

00:24:45,102 --> 00:24:46,069
Of course.

00:24:46,136 --> 00:24:49,806
If you are going
to give up your
pre-born child,

00:24:49,873 --> 00:24:52,209
you'd want to approve
of his or hers future
parents, right?

00:24:52,276 --> 00:24:54,511
Uh, one of your
special women,

00:24:54,578 --> 00:24:56,813
Christina Adalian,
was murdered.

00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,983
We're going
to need the names

00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:02,185
of her son's biological parents.

00:25:05,389 --> 00:25:08,492
I am, I'm sorry to hear
about Christina.

00:25:08,558 --> 00:25:09,927
I conducted her

Our records are confidential.

00:25:17,768 --> 00:25:18,735
I'm sorry.

00:25:18,802 --> 00:25:21,071
We can get a court order.

00:25:21,138 --> 00:25:23,540
So get one.

Ecklie said the tape
might be authentic.

00:26:29,506 --> 00:26:31,441
Seems so.

00:26:31,508 --> 00:26:33,610

what to do:

I need some guidance here.

I can't tell you what
to do, Sheriff.

00:26:51,228 --> 00:26:52,996
No, you can't.

00:26:53,063 --> 00:26:55,132
But you can tell me
where we stand.

00:27:48,785 --> 00:27:51,655
in sheet-writing
instruments.

00:27:51,722 --> 00:27:55,025
Lucky for us,
the uneven distribution
of the ink

00:27:55,092 --> 00:27:57,327
will be unique
to the pen that
wrote the note.

00:27:57,394 --> 00:28:00,097
Hey, Professor.
Looking good.

00:28:00,163 --> 00:28:02,032
You know
how sometimes

00:28:02,099 --> 00:28:04,201
fact is stranger than fiction?

00:28:04,268 --> 00:28:05,736
Yeah.

00:28:05,802 --> 00:28:06,970
Brass got the court order

00:28:07,037 --> 00:28:09,206
for Joey Adalian's
biological parents:

00:28:09,273 --> 00:28:11,875
a Kenli and Dan Johnson
in Seven Hills.

00:28:11,942 --> 00:28:14,044
We also found
Christina's will.

00:28:14,111 --> 00:28:16,713
Guess who she named
as Joey's guardians.

00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:17,814
Kenli and Dan?

00:28:19,516 --> 00:28:21,251
Excuse me.

00:28:21,318 --> 00:28:22,519
You're right.

00:28:22,586 --> 00:28:26,023
A single woman adopts
a leftover embryo

00:28:26,089 --> 00:28:28,258
from an
infertile couple

00:28:28,325 --> 00:28:30,460
and upon her death agrees
to give the child back

00:28:30,527 --> 00:28:32,095
to its biological parents?

00:28:32,162 --> 00:28:34,564
Who gave up the embryo
in the first place?

00:28:34,631 --> 00:28:37,567
You happen to have an address
for this Mr. and Mrs. Johnson?

00:28:37,634 --> 00:28:39,102
Let's go.

00:28:41,805 --> 00:28:43,807
Oh, hey. How's <i>The</i>
<i>Way of The Gun?</i>

00:28:43,874 --> 00:28:45,242
It was lost
in a poker game.

00:28:45,309 --> 00:28:46,576
Did you get
the winner's name?

00:28:46,643 --> 00:28:49,746
No, but he has a large mole
between his eyes

00:28:49,813 --> 00:28:51,114
and his nickname's "Cy."

00:28:51,181 --> 00:28:52,649
That's all I got,
so sorry.

00:28:52,716 --> 00:28:55,652
Greg, never apologize
for doing your job.

00:28:57,988 --> 00:28:59,389
Okay.

00:28:59,456 --> 00:29:02,392
<i>Dan and I were desperate</i>

00:29:02,459 --> 00:29:03,894
to have a child,

00:29:03,961 --> 00:29:06,296
and the doctor said
our only hope was
in-vitro.

00:29:06,363 --> 00:29:08,498
Where is your
husband now?

00:29:08,565 --> 00:29:10,300
He...

00:29:10,367 --> 00:29:12,235
He passed away.

00:29:12,302 --> 00:29:14,304
Are you sure I can't
get you something?

00:29:14,371 --> 00:29:16,907
No, thank you.

00:29:16,974 --> 00:29:19,476
Thank you, Mom.
You're welcome, baby.

00:29:19,543 --> 00:29:22,212
It's been almost a year.

00:29:22,279 --> 00:29:23,647
We were coming home
from a movie

00:29:23,714 --> 00:29:24,781
when we were
broadsided.

00:29:24,848 --> 00:29:28,085
The guy kept going
and Danny

00:29:28,151 --> 00:29:30,220
never woke up.

00:29:30,287 --> 00:29:33,023
WILLOWS:
I'm so sorry.

00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:37,160
Can I ask you...

00:29:37,227 --> 00:29:39,863
did you ever
conceive a child?

00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:42,299
My body kept
rejecting the procedure,

00:29:42,366 --> 00:29:44,001
so we tried
three times

00:29:44,067 --> 00:29:46,303
and then called
it quits.

00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:48,305
Had you ever considered
a surrogate?

00:29:48,372 --> 00:29:50,507
It's very expensive.

00:29:50,574 --> 00:29:54,611
Danny just was never comfortable
with the notion that...

00:29:54,678 --> 00:29:58,148
Well, we just figured
we weren't meant to be parents.

00:29:58,215 --> 00:30:00,717
And that's why you decided
to give away your embryos.

00:30:00,784 --> 00:30:02,886
Yeah, I had seen a flyer
at the clinic.

00:30:02,953 --> 00:30:06,290
Are you aware that one of those
embryos was carried to term?

00:30:06,356 --> 00:30:09,159
Dan and I pre-screened
Christina,

00:30:09,226 --> 00:30:12,963
and we went to see
Joey and her once a month.

00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:16,366
So that's why
when I got your call,

00:30:16,433 --> 00:30:19,136
I just don't know who'd want
to hurt such a sweet girl.

00:30:19,202 --> 00:30:23,507
According to Christina's will,
you were named Joey's guardian.

00:30:23,573 --> 00:30:25,809
Yes, that was very important
to Christina.

00:30:25,876 --> 00:30:26,910
She's not close

00:30:26,977 --> 00:30:28,111
with any
of her family,

00:30:28,178 --> 00:30:31,315
so I've already called
Child Services, and as soon

00:30:31,381 --> 00:30:34,751
the lawyer reviews the will,
I'm supposed to pick him up.

00:30:34,818 --> 00:30:36,153
Well, if you don't mind,

00:30:36,219 --> 00:30:38,155
I'd like your permission

00:30:38,221 --> 00:30:40,424
to take a look
at the clothing that you wore

00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:41,725
two nights ago.

00:30:41,792 --> 00:30:44,828
You can't possibly think
I had anything

00:30:44,895 --> 00:30:46,029
to do with this?

00:30:46,096 --> 00:30:48,932
It's protocol. The victim
was shot at close range.

00:31:03,413 --> 00:31:05,349
I wore the white blouse.

00:31:05,415 --> 00:31:08,518
We're going to need to take

00:31:08,585 --> 00:31:10,520
all the laundry
back to our lab.

00:31:10,587 --> 00:31:13,156
You never found the guy
who killed my husband,

00:31:13,223 --> 00:31:16,260
and now you're wasting time
looking at my dirty clothes.

00:31:16,326 --> 00:31:18,562
That's fine.

00:31:18,629 --> 00:31:20,564
Take it.

00:31:59,333 --> 00:32:01,736
Why did the fly, fly?

00:32:01,802 --> 00:32:04,739
Because the spider spied her.

00:32:04,805 --> 00:32:06,874
Catherine's daughter told me
that when she was three.

00:32:06,941 --> 00:32:09,076
Do we have results?

00:32:17,785 --> 00:32:19,286
Thank you.

00:32:21,622 --> 00:32:23,724
Oh, hey, Ecklie said
you wanted to see me.

00:32:23,791 --> 00:32:27,762
Yeah. A Dr. Ryan called and said
that you verbally harassed her?

00:32:27,828 --> 00:32:31,932
I met Dr. Ryan in the course
of my investigation.

00:32:31,999 --> 00:32:34,935
She runs an organization called
Project Sunflower.

00:32:35,002 --> 00:32:38,339
Philosophically, I completely
disagree with the organization.

00:32:38,406 --> 00:32:40,841
Perhaps I expressed myself.

00:32:40,908 --> 00:32:42,977
Which means?

00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:44,645
I'm pro-choice.

00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:46,180
I'm in favor of stem cell
research.

00:32:46,247 --> 00:32:48,115
I'm sorry she felt harassed,
but my comments were

00:32:48,182 --> 00:32:49,216
in response to her statements.

00:32:49,283 --> 00:32:50,985
I don't think I was out of line.

00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:54,555
You should have cited
Leviticus 17:11.

00:32:54,622 --> 00:32:57,258
"The life of the flesh
is in the blood."

00:32:57,324 --> 00:32:59,093
Taken literally,
life doesn't begin

00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,729
when the sperm meets the egg,
but 18 days later.

00:33:01,796 --> 00:33:03,297
When the embryo is infused
with blood.

00:33:03,364 --> 00:33:05,032
Is that your position?

00:33:05,099 --> 00:33:07,368
Well, if I were speaking
with a woman

00:33:07,435 --> 00:33:09,070
who prefers theology
to science,

00:33:09,136 --> 00:33:11,539
it's a position
she'd find tough to refute.

00:33:11,605 --> 00:33:14,942
So are we having a philosophical
discussion here,

00:33:15,009 --> 00:33:16,477
or am I being reprimanded?

00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:18,079
I don't know.

00:33:18,145 --> 00:33:19,714
I got to go to court.

00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:23,651
What?

00:33:23,718 --> 00:33:26,854
Your white blouse.
The results are printing.

00:33:33,027 --> 00:33:35,129
It seems like you
and Grissom

00:33:35,196 --> 00:33:36,864
were having a fairly
intense conversation.

00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:37,965
Can I ask...?

00:33:38,032 --> 00:33:39,767
Tell me about the blouse,
please.

00:33:41,001 --> 00:33:45,239
I ran the S.E.M. over
the adhesive disks

00:33:45,306 --> 00:33:48,542
and confirmed
gunshot residue.

00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:51,412
You found clothing
in a laundry basket

00:33:51,479 --> 00:33:54,181
that tested positive
for gunshot residue.

00:33:54,248 --> 00:33:55,516
So what?

00:33:55,583 --> 00:33:57,084
That doesn't mean my client
killed anyone.

00:33:57,151 --> 00:33:59,320
It proves that she fired a gun,
Carol.

00:33:59,387 --> 00:34:00,988
I've never fired a gun.

00:34:01,055 --> 00:34:02,723
I've never even touched a gun.

00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,692
CAROL:
Catherine, I'm sorry,
but if I understand

00:34:04,759 --> 00:34:09,096
your forensics,
the GSR test does not, in fact,

00:34:09,163 --> 00:34:11,198
confirm that she fired a gun.

00:34:11,265 --> 00:34:14,602
I mean, it's possible she rubbed
up against someone who did.

00:34:14,668 --> 00:34:16,103
Theoretically.

00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:18,906
I cared about Christina.

00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:21,776
I'm sure that you did.

00:34:21,842 --> 00:34:26,414
But looking into Joey's eyes
and seeing your husband,

00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,283
must've torn you
up inside.

00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:32,086
And the only person standing
between you and your baby

00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:33,854
was the victim.

00:34:33,921 --> 00:34:36,223
Okay, don't respond to that.

00:34:38,192 --> 00:34:41,262
When was the last time you
actually saw Christina?

00:34:44,231 --> 00:34:47,535
Two days ago. I took
them to lunch.

00:34:47,601 --> 00:34:49,937
What were you doing
two nights ago,

00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:52,006
around 11:00 p.m.?

00:34:52,073 --> 00:34:54,241
I was home all night.

00:34:54,308 --> 00:34:56,510
Can anyone verify that?

00:34:56,577 --> 00:35:00,881
My mom lives with me,
but she wasn't home.

00:35:00,948 --> 00:35:03,250
That's gin rummy night.

00:35:13,794 --> 00:35:15,262
What's going on in there?

00:35:15,329 --> 00:35:17,298
Kenli had nothing to do
with this.

00:35:17,364 --> 00:35:19,934
Mrs. Walkey, I need your help.

00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,869
Your daughter claims
that two night ago

00:35:21,936 --> 00:35:23,471
she was home

00:35:23,537 --> 00:35:24,705
watching television.

00:35:24,772 --> 00:35:26,073
Can you confirm that?

00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:29,243
Well, of course. I was with her.

00:35:30,311 --> 00:35:31,679
Thank you.

00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:58,038
If you had to guess,
what's Kenli's dress size?

00:35:58,105 --> 00:36:00,141
Four, maybe six.

00:36:00,207 --> 00:36:01,442
I found blood spatter

00:36:01,509 --> 00:36:04,178
on this blouse. Size 12.

00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:09,417
There're two women that live
at that house.

00:36:09,483 --> 00:36:12,386
Only one is a size 12.

00:36:12,453 --> 00:36:14,221
I don't need an attorney.

00:36:14,288 --> 00:36:15,623
I've done nothing wrong.

00:36:15,689 --> 00:36:18,492
Would you mind emptying
the contents of your purse?

00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:21,562
First you go after Kenli,
now me.

00:36:21,629 --> 00:36:23,464
A few hours ago, you guys
were saying

00:36:23,531 --> 00:36:26,200
there was gunshot powder
on Kenli's blouse.

00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:27,535
You make a mistake?

00:36:27,601 --> 00:36:30,204
No, it was probably transferred
from your blouse,

00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:31,839
the one that you wore
that night.

00:36:31,906 --> 00:36:33,707
I have a warrant to search
your person

00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:34,708
and your home.

00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:35,810
Please empty the contents

00:36:35,876 --> 00:36:37,712
of your purse onto the table.

00:36:49,724 --> 00:36:54,328
A red Coda pen.

00:36:55,229 --> 00:36:56,363
Joey...

00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:59,333
is...
( <i>sobbing</i> )

00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,269
better off...

00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:03,938
...without me.

00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:14,648
Please don't do this.

00:37:14,715 --> 00:37:16,083
Oh, God, please.

00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:18,552
Sign it.

00:37:18,619 --> 00:37:21,455
Sign it!

00:37:21,522 --> 00:37:23,791
You knew that her sister
was coming for a visit,

00:37:23,858 --> 00:37:26,060
so the baby
would be okay.

00:37:26,127 --> 00:37:28,562
You killed her
and then staged the scene.

00:37:32,299 --> 00:37:34,402
( <i>crying</i> )

00:37:49,784 --> 00:37:52,420
( <i>baby cries</i> )

00:37:58,793 --> 00:38:02,830
You have a wild imagination,
Ms. Willows.

00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:09,503
Is this your husband?

00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:12,073
Arnold.

00:38:12,139 --> 00:38:14,909
He passed away.

00:38:14,975 --> 00:38:16,510
Two years ago, May.

00:38:16,577 --> 00:38:18,112
He looks like a poker player.

00:38:18,179 --> 00:38:20,414
You can tell that
from his photo?

00:38:20,481 --> 00:38:22,983
Actually, it's...

00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:27,822
the mole between his eyes
that's his tell.

00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:29,990
Why are we talking about Arnie?

00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:32,193
Because you used his gun.

00:38:32,259 --> 00:38:34,195
The gun he won in a poker game.

00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:40,201
Are you going to put me in jail?

00:38:40,267 --> 00:38:43,537
That's how it works.

00:38:43,604 --> 00:38:46,373
And the baby-- he goes
with Kenli, right?

00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:51,812
I'm sure that Child Services
will follow

00:38:51,879 --> 00:38:54,315
the dictates
of Christina's will.

00:38:54,382 --> 00:38:56,684
Then it was all worth it.

00:38:58,018 --> 00:39:00,588
My baby has her baby.

00:39:00,654 --> 00:39:02,423
That's all that really matters.

00:39:03,824 --> 00:39:05,359
Did you ever consider

00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:08,362
that Christina Adalian
is somebody's baby?

00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:10,564
We each protect our own.

00:39:10,631 --> 00:39:12,867
That's how it's done.

00:39:14,301 --> 00:39:18,839
Officer, would you please escort
Mrs. Walkey to lockup?

00:39:28,649 --> 00:39:32,620
MAN:
As you can see, on day 14--
plenty of larvae,

00:39:32,686 --> 00:39:36,057
commonly known as maggots,
but no puparia.

00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:39,060
Finally on day 15,
you'll notice the puparia

00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:40,761
swimming in the brown liquid.

00:39:40,828 --> 00:39:44,598
Based on that evidence,
I can reliably conclude

00:39:44,665 --> 00:39:47,768
that Joanna Whitson
was killed on November 1.

00:39:47,835 --> 00:39:49,904
You're absolutely certain
of that timeline?

00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:50,905
Yes.

00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:53,908
Thank you.
No further questions.

00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:55,542
Your witness.

00:39:55,542 --> 00:39:57,711
We have no questions
for Dr. Thayer.

00:39:57,778 --> 00:40:00,681
But I now call to the stand
Dr. Gil Grissom

00:40:00,747 --> 00:40:01,815
as a rebuttal
expert witness.

00:40:01,882 --> 00:40:03,183
JUDGE:
Dr. Thayer, you're dismissed.

00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:06,253
Dr. Grissom, please approach
the stand to be sworn in.

00:40:09,523 --> 00:40:11,024
Raise your right hand.
Do you swear

00:40:11,091 --> 00:40:13,694
to tell the truth, the whole
truth, so help you God?

00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,028
I certainly do.

00:40:15,095 --> 00:40:16,530
You may be seated.

00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:20,300
Dr. Grissom,

00:40:20,367 --> 00:40:23,103
you've had a chance to review
Dr. Thayer's tape

00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,872
and associated evidence,
is that correct?

00:40:24,938 --> 00:40:25,973
Yes.

00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:29,576
Do you agree with his finding
that Joanna Whitson

00:40:29,643 --> 00:40:33,380
was murdered 15 days
before her body was discovered?

00:40:33,447 --> 00:40:34,982
No.

00:40:35,048 --> 00:40:36,016
Can you please elaborate?

00:40:36,083 --> 00:40:38,986
Our crime lab analyzed
fly larvae

00:40:39,052 --> 00:40:40,787
that was taken
from the pig

00:40:40,854 --> 00:40:44,057
used by Dr. Thayer
in his demonstration.

00:40:44,124 --> 00:40:48,996
Apparently, they digested
dimethyldithiophosphate

00:40:49,062 --> 00:40:50,931
and T-mulz Light Aromatic.

00:40:50,998 --> 00:40:53,934
A toxin commonly known
as malathion?

00:40:54,001 --> 00:40:55,569
Yes.

00:40:55,636 --> 00:40:59,573
I believe the malathion was
sprayed onto the pig's skin.

00:41:04,244 --> 00:41:06,847
How would malathion affect
a fly's life cycle?

00:41:06,914 --> 00:41:10,050
It would delay the time it takes
for puparia to appear.

00:41:10,117 --> 00:41:13,320
Specifically, the malathion
would delay oviposition.

00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:14,354
Oviposition?

00:41:14,421 --> 00:41:15,522
Laying eggs.

00:41:15,589 --> 00:41:18,058
Without malathion, adult flies

00:41:18,125 --> 00:41:20,561
would immediately
lay new eggs on the pig's flesh.

00:41:20,627 --> 00:41:22,329
But with malathion,

00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:25,299
oviposition would be delayed
up to four days.

00:41:25,365 --> 00:41:29,436
A four-day delay would mean
that Joanna Whitson died

00:41:29,503 --> 00:41:34,074
on November 4, not November 1,
Is that correct?

00:41:34,141 --> 00:41:35,709
Yes.

00:41:35,776 --> 00:41:37,511
Is there any scientific
rationale

00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:38,745
for spraying a pig
with malathion

00:41:38,812 --> 00:41:40,113
before documenting
a fly's life cycle?

00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:42,149
Objection.
Overruled.

00:41:42,216 --> 00:41:45,385
The only rationale I can think
of would be jury manipulation.

00:41:45,452 --> 00:41:48,388
Every entomologist knows
that early oviposition

00:41:48,455 --> 00:41:49,656
is undetectable

00:41:49,723 --> 00:41:52,559
because flies lay
their first round of eggs

00:41:52,626 --> 00:41:55,028
inside body openings.

00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:56,763
Anyone reviewing
the tape would assume

00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:59,466
that the eggs were being laid,
when in fact they were not.

00:41:59,533 --> 00:42:02,336
If our lab had not
tested the flies

00:42:02,402 --> 00:42:05,772
for toxins,
we would never have known that.

00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:07,908
Nor would the jury.

00:42:07,975 --> 00:42:10,577
Thank you. No further questions.

00:42:10,644 --> 00:42:13,447
Counselor, your witness.

00:42:13,514 --> 00:42:15,816
Uh, we have no questions
at this time.

00:42:15,883 --> 00:42:18,852
Oh, in that case,
we are adjourned

00:42:18,919 --> 00:42:20,654
until 9:00 a.m.
tomorrow morning.

00:42:26,593 --> 00:42:28,629
I want to talk to you.

00:42:28,695 --> 00:42:30,097
I have nothing to say to you.

00:42:30,164 --> 00:42:31,765
You impugned my character.

00:42:31,832 --> 00:42:33,534
What character?
Uh, excuse me,
Dr. Thayer.

00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,602
What the hell do you want?

00:42:35,669 --> 00:42:39,773
Well, to inform you that you
have the right to remain silent.

00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,675
The D.A.'s filing
charges for perjury

00:42:41,742 --> 00:42:43,410
Oh, my God...
and obstruction of justice.

00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:45,012
We won't be accepting
a plea.

00:42:45,078 --> 00:42:46,280
This is all your fault.

00:42:46,346 --> 00:42:48,382
I hope so.

00:42:51,752 --> 00:42:53,353
Grissom.

00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:55,389
Great work up there.

00:42:55,455 --> 00:42:56,990
Actually, the work
was done in the lab.

00:42:57,057 --> 00:42:58,058
When I took this job,

00:42:58,125 --> 00:43:00,360
I heard
a lot of things about you.

00:43:00,427 --> 00:43:03,297
If you ever need a favor,
if I can help you in any way...

00:43:03,363 --> 00:43:06,200
You know Sheriff,
you could help me.

00:43:06,266 --> 00:43:09,503
I'm late delivering my team's
personnel evaluations.

00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:10,671
I'll tell Ecklie.

00:43:10,737 --> 00:43:13,307
He'll backdate your
cost-of-living adjustments.

00:43:13,373 --> 00:43:14,741
Thank you.

00:43:14,808 --> 00:43:17,044
So, Grissom, I'm not sure
of your ambitions,

00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:19,847
but if you're interested in
taking on more responsibility,

00:43:19,913 --> 00:43:21,982
maybe a promotion,
I'd be glad to pass...

00:43:22,049 --> 00:43:23,584
You know, Oscar
Wilde once said,

00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:28,208
"Ambition is the last refuge
of failure." I'm fine. Thanks.
