00:00:46,148 --> 00:00:47,182
Hey.

00:00:47,249 --> 00:00:49,818
I was happy to hear
the Review Board cleared you.

00:00:49,885 --> 00:00:53,822
It's been a rough time,
but I'm dealing with it.

00:00:53,889 --> 00:00:57,326
Anyway, a kitchen worker
found him.

00:00:57,392 --> 00:00:59,494
Say a lot of
homeless people
hang out here.

00:00:59,561 --> 00:01:03,498
Says the vic was
unfamiliar to him.

00:01:03,565 --> 00:01:06,201
Creased khakis,
Oxford shirt, new shoes.

00:01:06,268 --> 00:01:07,202
This guy had a home.

00:01:07,269 --> 00:01:10,906
Well, I checked
the front pockets, no ID.

00:01:10,973 --> 00:01:12,074
Back pockets?

00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,375
I was leaving that for you.

00:01:14,376 --> 00:01:16,545
BRASS:
Looks like some blood
around his lips.

00:01:16,612 --> 00:01:18,213
Maybe somebody punched him
in the mouth.

00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,581
What do you think?

00:01:28,624 --> 00:01:30,726
Cranberry sauce.

00:01:30,792 --> 00:01:33,262
( <i>chuckles</i> ):
I know.

00:01:33,328 --> 00:01:34,796

You ever eat here?

Not since the chef blew his

I eat here all the time.

T.O.D., David?

Based on liver temp,

00:02:28,838 --> 00:02:30,339
he's been dead around two hours.

00:02:30,406 --> 00:02:34,877
WILLOWS:
Looks like he was knocked out
and thrown out.

00:02:34,944 --> 00:02:41,817
And there's some metallic
silver residue on his cheek.

00:02:45,187 --> 00:02:47,223
What's this gunk in his hands?

00:02:50,927 --> 00:02:52,862
Mashed potatoes.

00:02:52,929 --> 00:02:55,097
There were mashed potatoes
in the Dumpster.

00:02:56,432 --> 00:03:00,436
No fingernails...
on either hand.

00:03:02,238 --> 00:03:05,007
WILLOWS:
Maybe he was alive inside there.

00:03:05,074 --> 00:03:06,876
Digging to get out.

00:03:06,943 --> 00:03:09,345
Or he had really bad
table manners.

00:03:13,015 --> 00:03:18,020
There's some scarring on his
wrist, but not on the other.

00:03:20,323 --> 00:03:22,024
Look what I found in his pocket.

00:03:22,091 --> 00:03:24,694
"Aunt Jackpot's Pretzels."

00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,862
Oh, now, they make
a great pretzel.

00:03:26,929 --> 00:03:29,098
Maybe that's why he's got
that smile on his face.

( <i>indistinct</i>

00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:44,280
Double murder?

00:03:44,347 --> 00:03:45,381
Husband and wife.

00:03:45,448 --> 00:03:47,550
SIDLE:
Beat-up car in a Lexus
neighborhood.

00:03:47,617 --> 00:03:49,619
CURTIS:
We ran the plates.
R.O. doesn't live here.

00:03:49,685 --> 00:03:51,187
We're tracking her down.

00:03:51,254 --> 00:03:52,922
STOKES:
"Bitch on Wheels."

00:03:52,989 --> 00:03:55,124
Can't wait to meet her.

00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,597
Alarm was triggered
at 11:45 p.m.

00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:04,767
The monitoring company
notified P.D.

00:04:04,834 --> 00:04:06,636
when the homeowners didn't
return their call.

00:04:06,702 --> 00:04:09,805
Patrol finally arrived
at 3:32 a.m.

00:04:09,872 --> 00:04:11,440
Residentials are a low priority.

00:04:11,507 --> 00:04:12,808
They're usually false alarms.

00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,443
Not this one.

00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:17,146
Michael and Lori Tinsley.

00:04:17,213 --> 00:04:18,814
Kitchen door was open
when we arrived.

00:04:18,881 --> 00:04:20,583
His wallet was in his pocket.

00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:23,452
Her purse was on the counter.

00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:27,390
Cards, cash, TV, stereo,
it's all still here.

00:04:27,456 --> 00:04:31,460
STOKES:
If this was a robbery,
they missed all the good stuff.

00:04:31,527 --> 00:04:32,995
The coroner should be here
right now.

00:04:33,062 --> 00:04:35,598
So, uh, I'm gonna go see
what's happened to him.

00:04:38,367 --> 00:04:42,438
Well, looks like she
exsanguinated out her jugular.

00:04:42,505 --> 00:04:45,341
Abrasion on his forehead.

00:04:45,408 --> 00:04:47,043
No visible blood.

00:04:47,109 --> 00:04:49,245
Blonde hairs on his shirt.

00:04:49,312 --> 00:04:51,614
Both victims are brunette.

00:04:51,681 --> 00:04:55,184
Blonde hairs on the wife, too.

00:04:55,251 --> 00:04:59,989
And possible skin scrapings
under her fingernails.

00:05:00,056 --> 00:05:02,124
Maybe she got a piece
of her attacker.

00:05:02,191 --> 00:05:03,492
( <i>muffled scream</i> )

00:05:08,264 --> 00:05:10,666
If her neck was sliced
with a knife,

00:05:10,733 --> 00:05:11,767
it was probably serrated.

00:05:11,834 --> 00:05:14,203
The wound's too jagged
for a straight one.

00:05:16,072 --> 00:05:19,008
SIDLE:
Check out that record
collection.

00:05:19,075 --> 00:05:20,576
The cabinet door's open.

00:05:25,681 --> 00:05:26,716
Alphabetized.

00:05:26,782 --> 00:05:29,352
Classic rock.

00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:35,191
Looks like several records
have been removed recently.

00:05:42,465 --> 00:05:44,233
I'll dust for prints.

00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,636
Smudges in the blood trail.

00:05:46,702 --> 00:05:50,673
Ovoid shapes suggest
directionality.

00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:57,580
Satellite stains also suggest
suspect moved this direction.

00:05:57,647 --> 00:06:01,484
Judging by these gaps, I'd say
entire catalogs are missing.

00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:03,452
There is good money in vinyl.

00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:06,489
Especially if it's rare
and well-preserved.

00:06:06,556 --> 00:06:09,025
Who would kill somebody
over a bunch of records?

00:06:09,091 --> 00:06:12,228
Something's missing between
the Beach Boys and Billy Joel.

00:06:12,295 --> 00:06:14,030
BOTH:
The Beatles.

00:06:20,269 --> 00:06:22,772
Loose strike.

00:06:22,838 --> 00:06:25,541
Would have been pretty easy
to get in from back here.

00:06:27,543 --> 00:06:29,712
They have a dog.

00:06:29,779 --> 00:06:32,748
Sofia said the door was open;
maybe he took off.

00:06:32,815 --> 00:06:35,718
Blood stains stop
at the grass.

00:06:35,785 --> 00:06:36,719
Sprinklers are on now,

00:06:36,786 --> 00:06:39,088
kissing the evidence good-bye.

00:06:39,155 --> 00:06:40,156
Hey, Nick.

00:06:40,223 --> 00:06:41,157
Yeah?

00:06:41,224 --> 00:06:43,893
There was some blood
on these dog bowls.

00:06:48,864 --> 00:06:49,932
Considerable.

00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:55,705
( <i>thud</i> )

00:06:55,771 --> 00:06:58,941

I'll call Animal Control.

00:07:47,023 --> 00:07:49,292
DR. ROBBINS:
Stomach is massively distended.

00:07:49,358 --> 00:07:51,794
Human stomachs have a volume
of about one liter,

00:07:51,861 --> 00:07:52,828
a little more than a quart.

00:07:52,895 --> 00:07:55,097
But they have the
ability to expand

00:07:55,164 --> 00:07:56,499
and hold up to four liters.

00:07:56,566 --> 00:07:57,700
But looking at this guy,

00:07:57,767 --> 00:08:00,036
I'd say he was packing
around six.

00:08:00,102 --> 00:08:01,704
And that's your COD.

00:08:01,771 --> 00:08:05,274

<i>due to gastric dilatation.</i>

00:08:10,746 --> 00:08:12,448
His stomach expanded,

00:08:12,515 --> 00:08:14,183
leaving no room
for the organs.

00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:17,687
It's going to keep me on my diet
for a couple more weeks.

00:08:17,753 --> 00:08:19,188
Let's take a look.

00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:25,394
Ooh, the guy
was a walking buffet.

00:08:25,461 --> 00:08:27,163
Multiple contusions.

00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:30,333
He's got a band of dead tissue
on his wrist.

00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:33,102
No fingernails.

00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:35,805
Cuticle's are inflamed
and still intact.

00:08:35,871 --> 00:08:36,806
They weren't pulled off.

00:08:36,872 --> 00:08:37,907
They were bitten down...

00:08:39,775 --> 00:08:41,477
At first I thought
tortured and force fed,

00:08:41,544 --> 00:08:44,046
but the usual signs of force
feeding are absent.

00:08:44,113 --> 00:08:46,349
No abrasions on the mucosal
surface of the lips.

00:08:46,415 --> 00:08:49,218
No aspirated food
in the airways.

00:08:49,285 --> 00:08:50,820
So what are you thinking now?

00:08:52,021 --> 00:08:54,657
He ate himself to death.

00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,662
Do you recognize
this face?

00:09:00,417 --> 00:09:01,685
MAN:
I know exactly who that is.

00:09:01,752 --> 00:09:03,087
Man, dude's crazy.

00:09:03,153 --> 00:09:04,321
Dude got a name?

00:09:04,388 --> 00:09:05,289
No name.

00:09:05,356 --> 00:09:06,190
Oh, but I got a wallet.

00:09:06,257 --> 00:09:08,526
What, he left it behind?

00:09:08,592 --> 00:09:10,027
More like he threw it.

00:09:12,463 --> 00:09:13,430
Pretzel, thank you,
please.

00:09:13,497 --> 00:09:14,532
Hey, pal.

00:09:14,598 --> 00:09:15,799
Where's your manners?

00:09:15,866 --> 00:09:17,968
Just one pretzel, please.
Just a quick, fast one.

00:09:18,035 --> 00:09:18,969
Come on.
No, no.

00:09:19,036 --> 00:09:21,705
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
I said no!

00:09:21,772 --> 00:09:22,606
Excuse me.

00:09:22,673 --> 00:09:25,809
See, salty pretzel's $1.50.

00:09:25,876 --> 00:09:27,478
Only a dollar
in the wallet.

00:09:27,545 --> 00:09:29,113
Jerk.

00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:31,715
Hey, and I took
the money, by the way.

00:09:31,782 --> 00:09:33,083
I didn't care.

00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,218
Oh, I saw that.

00:09:34,285 --> 00:09:35,819
Sports Promotions.

00:09:35,886 --> 00:09:38,789
Man, I seen
his gut, man.

00:09:38,856 --> 00:09:39,857
He don't look
like he no athlete.

00:09:39,924 --> 00:09:42,459
They're calling poker players
athletes these days.

00:09:42,526 --> 00:09:44,061
Seen the guts on them?

00:09:44,128 --> 00:09:46,497
Hey, can I get
a pineapple cinnamon?

00:09:46,564 --> 00:09:48,165
Oh, okay, good choice.

00:09:48,232 --> 00:09:50,234
Thank you.

O198. Please leave your message

All right, let's take
a look at our Cujo.

00:10:07,885 --> 00:10:09,854
( <i>soft whining</i> )

00:10:11,589 --> 00:10:14,191
Yeah, she's ferocious.

STOKES:
Yeah, yeah, I'm petrified.

00:10:16,427 --> 00:10:18,329
So what's the outside chance
of rabies?

00:10:18,395 --> 00:10:20,865
She's not salivating excessively

00:10:20,931 --> 00:10:23,767
or showing any signs
of hydrophobia,

00:10:23,834 --> 00:10:25,169
but rabies doesn't
present immediately.

00:10:25,236 --> 00:10:27,504
She'll be quarantined
for the next ten days.

00:10:27,571 --> 00:10:28,839
Well, other than rabies,

00:10:28,906 --> 00:10:31,008
what would make a dog
attack its owner?

00:10:31,075 --> 00:10:31,909
Abuse?

00:10:31,976 --> 00:10:35,079
Abused animals
may turn violent.

00:10:35,145 --> 00:10:37,414
Head traumas may induce
unprovoked aggression.

00:10:37,481 --> 00:10:39,283
And there's always
springer rage.

00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:41,585
Yeah, yeah,
I hate that show, too.

00:10:41,652 --> 00:10:43,354
( <i>chuckles )</i>

00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,756
It's a form of epilepsy
associated with several breeds,

00:10:45,823 --> 00:10:48,459
including springers
and retrievers.

00:10:48,526 --> 00:10:51,695
Man's best friend will back you
into a corner and attack.

00:10:51,762 --> 00:10:52,897
Five minutes later,

00:10:52,963 --> 00:10:54,965

Look, he said Lori was planning
on selling his vinyls.

00:12:05,336 --> 00:12:08,172

was out and he was at work,

00:12:08,239 --> 00:12:09,406
he gave me the keys,

Soon, all the vendors
at the Polo Grounds
were selling them, too.

00:21:31,231 --> 00:21:33,066
But they were too lazy to say
"dachshund sausages,"

00:21:33,133 --> 00:21:34,501
so they just called them
"hot dogs."

00:21:34,568 --> 00:21:38,271
Now there's over
50 major brands.

00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:40,240
Good luck.
I'm rooting for you.

00:21:40,307 --> 00:21:43,043

trains with his pit bulls,
three-time rib champion--

00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:33,479
today he will be wearing
the E.X.E.F. hot dog camera--

00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:37,249

to eat your way into history.

00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:49,928
They're diving

Marty Mayron going
with the Japanese,

dipping his bun in lemonade
to make it go down easier

00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:58,604
and then biting that hot dog
into little pieces.

Not to be outdone, Miomoto going
for the double Japanese.

00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:04,309
Colletti, the old pro,

00:24:06,078 --> 00:24:08,013
That is a Heimlich

he's doing a reverse Japanese:

00:24:10,516 --> 00:24:12,484
Bun first,
hot dog afterwards.

00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:15,587
Sort of a "dachshund chaser."

Still pushing it,
going old school,

00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:19,258

That's an immediate
disqualification,

and, of course, disgusting
for all of us to watch.

00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:44,083
Wow.

Well, which one

00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:49,354
The guy in the silver

By far, one of the best walk-on
gurgitators I've ever seen.

00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:08,073
So you gave him your
business card, right?

00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:10,175
I'm the U.S. rep

what exactly
does that stand for?

00:25:14,113 --> 00:25:16,081
It's the Extreme Eating
Federation.

00:25:16,148 --> 00:25:18,517
We're one of the most popular
leagues in the sport.

00:25:18,584 --> 00:25:20,853

You got 30 Neanderthals in
a cave and a rabbit walks in,

00:25:25,591 --> 00:25:27,726
you have a competitive eating
situation, my friend.

00:25:27,793 --> 00:25:29,661
We have rules, records,
prize money.

00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:30,963
Some of our top

00:25:34,066 --> 00:25:35,434
No kidding.

00:25:35,501 --> 00:25:37,603
Well, what does all this
have to do with Jerry?

00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:39,071
Everything.

00:25:39,138 --> 00:25:41,607
Jerry had undeniable
gastro-intestinal fortitude.

00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:44,410
He took third in
yesterday's competition.

00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:46,345

the finals in Atlantic City.

I'm telling you,
with proper training,

00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,678
Jerry could've proudly
represented the U.S.

00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:22,448
and taken back the Golden Weenie
from the Japanese Champion.

00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:24,616
Yeah, got to get
that Golden Weenie back.

00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:27,586
Uh, so after the tournament,
did you see Jerry?

00:26:27,653 --> 00:26:30,956
Paid him, gave him my card,
left him to celebrate.

00:26:31,023 --> 00:26:33,225
Any idea who
he was celebrating with?

00:26:34,293 --> 00:26:35,894
You want a sample
of my face paint?

00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:38,964
Yeah, it's part of
my investigation.

00:26:39,031 --> 00:26:41,033
Oh, it's still moist.

00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,301
That's good for me.

00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:45,304
I didn't do anything
to Jerry Gable.

00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:46,972
Okay, in the beginning,

00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,641
I admit I was a
little pee'd off

00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:51,643
that I lost to the guy.

00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,045
But then I learned

00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:55,247
what a disturbed
individual he was.

00:26:55,314 --> 00:26:56,682
Couple more!

00:26:56,749 --> 00:26:59,785
Just, just, just, just,
a couple... couple more!

00:26:59,852 --> 00:27:02,521

Some guy in a hat came by,
took him out of here.

00:27:21,907 --> 00:27:23,942
Is that the guy in the hat?

It slipped under

Kahlua attacked Lori.

Well, a dog did attack Lori,

The bite marks
on Lori's neck

All the dog hair we found

was consistent with
a golden retriever,

00:29:18,791 --> 00:29:20,592

there was another

It's as if your stomach
was truly a bottomless pit.

00:31:38,953 --> 00:31:43,024
That could explain why
after consuming 22 dogs,

00:31:43,091 --> 00:31:44,626
he wanted more.

00:31:44,692 --> 00:31:46,928
Could also explain why he was
found in the Dumpster.

00:31:46,995 --> 00:31:48,229
He followed the food.

00:31:48,296 --> 00:31:50,565
Prader-Willi Syndrome is
characterized by short stature,

00:31:50,632 --> 00:31:52,967
hypotonia, almond-shaped eyes,

00:31:53,034 --> 00:31:55,336
and obsessive fingernail biting.

00:31:55,403 --> 00:31:57,705
That kind of fits
the victim's description.

00:31:57,772 --> 00:32:00,675
Sufferers are born with
a flawed hypothalamus.

00:32:00,742 --> 00:32:02,810
Normal hypothalamus receives
a signal from the stomach--

00:32:02,877 --> 00:32:04,646
"I'm full, stop eating."

00:32:04,712 --> 00:32:06,781
( <i>cheering</i> )

00:32:11,886 --> 00:32:14,322
GRISSOM:
<i>But with Prader-Willi Syndrome,</i>

00:32:14,389 --> 00:32:16,391
<i>the signal never reaches</i>
<i>the brain.</i>

00:32:28,136 --> 00:32:30,271
They're always hungry.

00:32:30,338 --> 00:32:33,074
Like having a full tank of gas,
and gauge is stuck on empty.

00:32:33,141 --> 00:32:36,578
Guy's like Jerry are monitored
their whole lives.

00:32:36,644 --> 00:32:39,647
Constant supervision
24 hours a day.

00:32:39,714 --> 00:32:42,984
You remember the scar tissue
we found on his wrist?

00:32:46,621 --> 00:32:49,224
( <i>grunting and groaning</i> )

00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:50,959
I think it's possible
that our vic

00:32:51,025 --> 00:32:53,194
spent most of his life
in restraints.

00:32:53,261 --> 00:32:55,997
So either he escaped or...

00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:58,433
someone set him free.

00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:01,236
In which case, they'd be
responsible for his death.

00:33:01,302 --> 00:33:03,571
I heard your case
has gone to the dogs.

00:33:03,638 --> 00:33:05,507
Oh, Hodges, heel.

00:33:05,573 --> 00:33:07,141
No, better yet,
play dead, man.

00:33:07,208 --> 00:33:09,277
Play nice,
I'm throwing you a bone.

00:33:09,344 --> 00:33:11,546
The fingernail scrapings
from your female vic

00:33:11,613 --> 00:33:13,314
was baking grease.

00:33:13,381 --> 00:33:15,283
How does that fit
in the puzzle?

00:33:20,889 --> 00:33:22,390
Hey.

00:33:22,457 --> 00:33:23,992
According to
the court records,

00:33:24,058 --> 00:33:25,960
the Tinsleys weren't just
fighting over property,

00:33:26,027 --> 00:33:28,396
they were also engaged in
an expensive custody battle.

00:33:28,463 --> 00:33:29,664
Custody over what?

00:33:29,731 --> 00:33:31,232
They didn't have any kids.

00:33:31,299 --> 00:33:32,667
They had Kahlua.

00:33:34,636 --> 00:33:37,572
And evidentally,
yesterday both parties agreed

00:33:37,639 --> 00:33:40,275
to let the dog decide
for herself.

00:33:40,341 --> 00:33:41,776
According to
Michael's girlfriend,

00:33:41,843 --> 00:33:44,612
the dog was his,
but Kahlua chose Lori.

00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:46,181
MICHAEL:
Kahlua, come.

00:33:46,247 --> 00:33:47,482
Kahlua, come.
Come here.

00:33:47,549 --> 00:33:49,284
( <i>clapping</i> ):
Come.
Come here.

00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:50,451
Kahlua, come.
Come.

00:33:50,518 --> 00:33:51,653
Come.
Kahlua.

00:33:55,824 --> 00:33:57,392
I think I know why.

00:33:58,693 --> 00:34:01,830
<i>Lori greased up</i>
<i>before the big face-off.</i>

00:34:03,097 --> 00:34:04,799
Kahlua, come.

00:34:04,866 --> 00:34:06,367
LORI:
Come, Kahlua.

00:34:06,434 --> 00:34:07,402
Kahlua, Kahlua, come.

00:34:07,468 --> 00:34:08,436
MICHAEL:
Come, come here.

00:34:08,503 --> 00:34:10,171
Kahlua, come here.

00:34:10,238 --> 00:34:11,539
Come.

00:34:14,442 --> 00:34:15,677
A dog's sense of smell

00:34:15,743 --> 00:34:18,213
is 25 times more
sensitive than humans.

00:34:18,279 --> 00:34:21,115
Bacon grease would've been
pretty irresistible.

00:34:21,182 --> 00:34:22,951
Question is...

00:34:23,017 --> 00:34:25,587
"Did Michael know that Lori
was playing dirty?"

00:34:25,653 --> 00:34:27,388
( <i>cell phone rings</i> )

00:34:27,455 --> 00:34:29,257
Stokes.

00:34:30,358 --> 00:34:31,893
Yeah, all right, cool.

00:34:33,495 --> 00:34:36,531
Our suspect is in custody.

00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:39,567
MENKEN:
<i>Animal control</i>

00:34:39,634 --> 00:34:41,069
picked her up
near Centennial Park,

00:34:41,135 --> 00:34:43,638
called the number on the tag,
left a voice mail.

00:34:43,705 --> 00:34:45,006
Dead people
don't return calls.

00:34:45,073 --> 00:34:48,009
New collar, new tags.

00:34:48,076 --> 00:34:49,544
Kahlua.
Same name.

00:34:49,611 --> 00:34:51,012
Spoke to Animal Control.

00:34:51,079 --> 00:34:54,682
Kahlua number two was adopted
the same day as the murder.

00:34:54,749 --> 00:34:55,917
You want to guess
the adopter's name?

00:34:55,984 --> 00:34:57,685
Michael Tinsley.

00:34:57,752 --> 00:34:59,053
You bet.

00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,989
He adopted Kahlua's
doppelganger.

00:35:01,055 --> 00:35:04,826
Left tooth is chipped.
Confirm's ID.

00:35:04,893 --> 00:35:06,561
She doesn't seem very ferocious.

00:35:06,628 --> 00:35:07,595
You want to see ferocious?

00:35:07,662 --> 00:35:09,063
Yeah.

00:35:18,139 --> 00:35:20,642
( <i>barking</i> )

( <i>barking</i> )

00:35:24,646 --> 00:35:26,047
How did you know?

00:35:26,114 --> 00:35:28,683
When the guys loaded her up
into the Animal Control van,

00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:30,418
they slammed the door
and she went off.

00:35:30,485 --> 00:35:31,920
So the gun acted as a trigger.

00:35:31,986 --> 00:35:33,454
She heard it and attacked Lori.

00:35:33,521 --> 00:35:35,623
MENKEN:
Probably abused
in the past.

00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:36,925
If they'd known,
they never would've

00:35:36,991 --> 00:35:38,193
put her up for adoption.

00:35:38,259 --> 00:35:41,729
Michael broke into the house
intending to swap dogs,

00:35:41,796 --> 00:35:43,932
hoping that Lori wouldn't even
notice the difference.

00:35:43,998 --> 00:35:45,233
( <i>doorknob rattling )</i>

00:35:51,472 --> 00:35:55,210
( <i>alarm blaring</i> )

00:35:55,276 --> 00:35:56,978
You don't give
a damn about Kahlua!

00:35:57,045 --> 00:35:58,112
You just don't want me
to have her!

00:35:58,179 --> 00:35:59,614
You care more
about that stupid dog

00:35:59,681 --> 00:36:00,648
than you did me!

00:36:00,715 --> 00:36:01,950
For once
you got it right!

00:36:02,016 --> 00:36:05,954
( <i>alarm blaring</i> )

( <i>snarling</i> )

00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:18,233
When Kahlua number two took off,

00:36:18,299 --> 00:36:21,002
Kahlua number one
came out of hiding.

00:36:30,411 --> 00:36:33,615
( <i>whining</i> )

00:36:33,681 --> 00:36:35,350
The police showed up,
she got scared ,

00:36:35,416 --> 00:36:36,584
went back to her closet.

00:36:36,651 --> 00:36:38,419
Their marriage ended
in a dog fight,

00:36:38,486 --> 00:36:40,922
and only the dog survived.

00:36:40,989 --> 00:36:43,258
BRASS:
So I called about
a dozen Jerry Gables.

00:36:43,324 --> 00:36:47,629
One had an answering machine
for Jerry and Suzie Gable.

00:36:47,695 --> 00:36:50,231
This apartment is listed
to Jerry and Suzie Gable.

00:36:50,298 --> 00:36:52,467
Here's Suzie.

00:36:52,534 --> 00:36:54,335
( <i>knocking</i> )
Las Vegas Police.

00:36:58,406 --> 00:37:00,308
Please tell me you found Jerry.

00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:18,326
Okay, so who are you?

00:37:18,393 --> 00:37:20,695
I'm Susie's boyfriend.

00:37:20,762 --> 00:37:23,064
All right, Susie's boyfriend,
what's your name?

00:37:23,131 --> 00:37:25,366
Look, I don't have
anything else to say.

00:37:25,433 --> 00:37:27,902
Hey, that's
my easiest question.

00:37:27,969 --> 00:37:30,872
Hey, you don't want
to give us your name, fine,

00:37:30,939 --> 00:37:33,708
but you better explain
why Jerry's not in this chair.

00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:39,581
All right, look, I'm going
to print this restraint.

00:37:39,647 --> 00:37:41,983
And when I find your
fingerprints all over it,

00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:44,219
I won't need
to ask you again.

00:37:44,285 --> 00:37:46,521
Okay, okay, all right.

00:37:47,922 --> 00:37:49,557
He escaped.

00:37:49,624 --> 00:37:51,526
All right? I was supposed
to be watching him,

00:37:51,593 --> 00:37:54,229
and I conked out for a second,
and by the time I got up,

00:37:54,295 --> 00:37:55,430
he was gone from his chair.

00:37:55,497 --> 00:37:56,431
He escaped?

00:37:56,498 --> 00:37:58,399
So, what, the guy's Houdini?

00:37:58,466 --> 00:38:00,001
Trust me.

00:38:00,068 --> 00:38:02,403
He may have been slow,
but he was manipulative.

00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:03,738
Yeah.

00:38:03,805 --> 00:38:09,444
Look, how do you deny
a 30-year-old man food?

00:38:10,612 --> 00:38:11,946
I mean, I felt like

00:38:12,013 --> 00:38:13,615
I was torturing the poor guy.

00:38:13,681 --> 00:38:16,618
Yeah, I told you
them Vikings suck.

00:38:16,684 --> 00:38:20,622
All right, I'll meet you
at the Circus Town book.

00:38:20,688 --> 00:38:24,092
Can I go
to Circus Town with you?

00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:26,394
I heard the buffet there
is yummy.

00:38:26,461 --> 00:38:28,062
No.

00:38:28,129 --> 00:38:33,902
( <i>indistinct TV audio</i> )

00:38:37,172 --> 00:38:39,607
My plan was just
to drop him off at the buffet

00:38:39,674 --> 00:38:41,643
while I went back
to the sports book.

00:38:41,709 --> 00:38:47,215
By the time I got back...
oh, man...

00:38:47,282 --> 00:38:49,284
Hey!
( <i>glass clinking</i> )

00:39:04,132 --> 00:39:06,467
I couldn't help myself.

00:39:06,534 --> 00:39:08,203
I had to sign him up.

00:39:09,704 --> 00:39:10,672
So let me guess--

00:39:10,738 --> 00:39:12,574
you blew his winnings
at the sports book?

00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,876
Well, what was he
gonna do with them?

00:39:14,943 --> 00:39:17,745
He's been strapped to a damn
chair his whole life.

00:39:17,812 --> 00:39:19,814
You know, you managed
to supersize a combo

00:39:19,881 --> 00:39:21,649
of two deadly sins--
greed and gluttony.

00:39:21,716 --> 00:39:24,419
Shame on you.

00:39:24,486 --> 00:39:26,321
So what's he doing
in a dumpster?

00:39:26,387 --> 00:39:29,624
I don't know, was there
food in the dumpster?

00:39:29,691 --> 00:39:31,092
'Cause when we were

00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:32,927
on our way home,
Jerry was still hungry.

00:39:32,994 --> 00:39:34,295
Wanted to hit up Krispy Kreme.

00:39:34,362 --> 00:39:36,631
And by the time
I could tell him no,

00:39:36,698 --> 00:39:39,000
he was running off
down the street.

00:39:39,067 --> 00:39:41,669
I looked for him all night.

00:39:41,736 --> 00:39:44,839
Yeah? Where's Susie?

00:39:48,009 --> 00:39:51,212
I knew I shouldn't have left
Jerry with my boyfriend.

00:39:51,279 --> 00:39:53,248
I'd been calling to check in.

00:39:53,314 --> 00:39:54,415
He wasn't answering.

00:39:54,482 --> 00:39:56,851
I could tell something was up.

00:39:56,918 --> 00:39:58,419
Why did you leave
your brother

00:39:58,486 --> 00:40:00,255
with somebody
you didn't trust?

00:40:00,321 --> 00:40:02,223
There was no one else.

00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:04,425
I had to get
this surgery today

00:40:04,492 --> 00:40:07,829
or my insurance wasn't
going to cover it.

00:40:07,896 --> 00:40:10,198
Couldn't you have left him
with a family member?

00:40:10,265 --> 00:40:12,200
We have no family.

00:40:12,267 --> 00:40:17,906
Our parents died
in a car crash years ago.

00:40:17,972 --> 00:40:21,176
What about some kind
of professional help?

00:40:21,242 --> 00:40:23,611
I'm a waitress, Miss.

00:40:23,678 --> 00:40:27,749
I... I don't make much.

00:40:27,815 --> 00:40:30,952
There's a really nice
institution in Summerlin,

00:40:31,019 --> 00:40:33,955
but it costs a $100,000 a year.

00:40:34,022 --> 00:40:37,725
And the last babysitter I hired,

00:40:37,792 --> 00:40:41,296
Jerry beat up
trying to get to the fridge.

00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:44,299
I swear to you,

00:40:44,365 --> 00:40:46,334
I really tried to take
care of my brother.

00:40:46,401 --> 00:40:50,338
I really...
did the best I could.

00:41:11,208 --> 00:41:13,844
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:41:21,052 --> 00:41:23,421
Jerry took third place?

00:41:23,487 --> 00:41:25,890
Yeah.

00:41:27,667 --> 00:41:29,959
I bet he had
the time of his life.
