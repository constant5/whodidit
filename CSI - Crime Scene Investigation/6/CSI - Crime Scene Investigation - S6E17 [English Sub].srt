CURTIS:
Vic's name's Christina Hollis.

00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,378
She's a sales agent
for the building.

00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:53,680
Neighbor said she just came
running out of her unit,

00:01:53,747 --> 00:01:55,716
delirious
and hysterical.

00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:56,950
Sexual assault?

00:01:57,017 --> 00:01:58,018
Definitely.

00:01:58,085 --> 00:01:59,653
I'm gonna go with her
to the hospital,

00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,655
see if I can
get a statement.

00:02:06,026 --> 00:02:07,394
GRISSOM:
Video cameras.

00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:09,029
That's good for us.

00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:11,865
Vic probably thought it
was good for her, too.

00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:13,300
Excuse me, hi,
can you identify yourself

00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:14,401
for the camera, please?

PRODUCER:
Just look right in the lens.

00:02:16,003 --> 00:02:17,804
What is this?
It's a reality crime show.

00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:19,540
We're following you
for this investigation.

00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:21,275
Sheriff promised
full cooperation.

00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:23,610
We got that memo.
They're <i>Hard Crime.</i>

00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:25,846
That's us-- we're the guys
who put the folks

00:02:25,913 --> 00:02:28,282

00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:29,583
Right.

for the department.

their chops, okay?

PRODUCER:
You ever see the show?
It's got a lot of forensics.

00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:37,224
There's too many

plate are all clean.

No sign of
a forced entry.

00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:48,635
So she might have
known her assailant.

00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:51,338
Either that
or he talked his way in.

Okay, this isn't right.

00:04:51,744 --> 00:04:53,112
Why isn't this right?

00:04:53,178 --> 00:04:54,146
Why don't I look right?

00:04:54,213 --> 00:04:55,614
Christina, it's okay.

00:04:55,681 --> 00:04:56,882
No, it's not okay.

00:04:56,949 --> 00:04:57,883
It's not okay.

00:05:07,693 --> 00:05:09,828
Stop looking at me!

00:05:09,895 --> 00:05:11,497

( <i>sobbing</i> )

00:05:11,563 --> 00:05:14,033

NURSE:
I did a wet mount
from a vaginal swab

00:05:17,703 --> 00:05:19,805
and got 4-plus
motile sperm present.

00:05:19,872 --> 00:05:22,041
So she was raped
within the last few hours.

00:05:22,107 --> 00:05:24,310
No condom means
he's not in the system

00:05:24,376 --> 00:05:26,178
or he doesn't care
if he gets caught.

00:05:26,245 --> 00:05:27,780
Guys like this,
they keep doing it.

PRODUCER:
Excuse me, Detective.

00:05:28,914 --> 00:05:30,316
Can I ask you
a question?

00:05:30,382 --> 00:05:31,684
Detective.

00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,719
You try something like that
again and you're gone.

00:05:33,786 --> 00:05:35,955
I don't a give a damn
what the sheriff says.

00:05:36,021 --> 00:05:38,157
We never put anyone on screen
without a signed release.

00:05:38,223 --> 00:05:40,125
You invaded her privacy
at her most vulnerable moment.

00:05:40,192 --> 00:05:42,061
I am trying to give
the crime a face.

00:05:42,127 --> 00:05:43,862
Yeah, well,
we're going to lose an hour

00:05:43,929 --> 00:05:45,130
waiting for her to calm down.

00:05:45,197 --> 00:05:46,265
That's on you.

00:05:46,332 --> 00:05:48,434
I apologize.
It won't happen again.

00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,669
Look, can I just ask you
what you've got there?

00:05:50,736 --> 00:05:53,606
It's a sexual assault evidence
kit and blood sample.

00:05:53,672 --> 00:05:56,809
I've seen date rape victims
in similar dissociative states.

00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:59,278
We're going to run a tox screen,
see if she was drugged.

00:05:59,345 --> 00:06:00,846
You were a CSI, right?

00:06:00,913 --> 00:06:01,847
Yeah.

00:06:01,914 --> 00:06:03,515
And now you're
a detective.

00:06:03,582 --> 00:06:05,784
So which side of
the fence do you prefer?

00:06:05,851 --> 00:06:07,920
It's the same side.

Some date.

( <i>camera clicks</i> )

00:07:11,984 --> 00:07:14,887
There's a void
in the wax.

00:07:31,103 --> 00:07:34,106
Some kind of white
flaky substance.

00:07:47,586 --> 00:07:49,388
This looks like blood, but...

00:07:57,029 --> 00:07:59,231
I think it's nail polish.

BRASS:
Hey, how's it going?

00:08:16,115 --> 00:08:17,316
According to your supervisor,

00:08:17,383 --> 00:08:19,518
you were doing maintenance work
on the 11th floor

00:08:19,585 --> 00:08:20,486
at 5:00 a.m.

00:08:20,552 --> 00:08:22,655
What were you fixing

00:08:22,721 --> 00:08:23,923
at 5:00 in the morning?

00:08:23,989 --> 00:08:26,525
I was just clocking
a little overtime.

00:08:27,927 --> 00:08:31,096
Management said they wanted
a few extra coats of paint

00:08:31,163 --> 00:08:32,431
on three, seven and 11.

00:08:32,498 --> 00:08:35,334
Got to keep everything
nice and pretty for the tenants.

00:08:35,401 --> 00:08:36,902
You know, the security guy

00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:38,771
didn't see you on his camera.
Why is that?

00:08:38,837 --> 00:08:41,106
Yeah, well, that guy
doesn't see much.

00:08:41,173 --> 00:08:42,741
Service elevator's out.

00:08:42,808 --> 00:08:44,376
We have to use the stairs.

00:08:44,443 --> 00:08:47,346
God forbid the tenants
ever have to look at one of us.

00:08:47,413 --> 00:08:49,515
You got a master key
to all the apartments?

00:08:49,581 --> 00:08:50,950
Yeah.

00:08:51,016 --> 00:08:52,184
But we only go in

00:08:52,251 --> 00:08:55,087
if a tenant specifically
asks us to fix something.

00:08:55,154 --> 00:08:57,356
You ever fix anything
for Christina Hollis?

00:08:57,423 --> 00:08:59,959
Nope. Never.

00:09:09,802 --> 00:09:12,738
You're running a little low
on duct tape, my man.

00:09:12,805 --> 00:09:14,306
Yeah.

00:09:14,373 --> 00:09:16,842
It's holding up
half the building.

00:09:26,986 --> 00:09:28,554
Two pieces of duct tape,

00:09:28,621 --> 00:09:30,956
both have been swabbed
for DNA and fingerprinted.

00:09:31,023 --> 00:09:32,758
Grissom wants you
to compare adhesives.

00:09:32,825 --> 00:09:34,326
He's looking for a match.

00:09:34,393 --> 00:09:36,095
Okay.

00:09:36,161 --> 00:09:37,997
That'll take
a laser ablation test.

00:09:38,063 --> 00:09:39,164
That's good.

00:09:39,231 --> 00:09:40,666
Why's that good?

00:09:40,733 --> 00:09:45,137
Well, laser ablation
is both visual and dramatic.

00:09:45,204 --> 00:09:48,674
Are you looking
for the video crew right now?

00:09:48,741 --> 00:09:51,577
I would think that
they would be looking for me.

00:09:51,644 --> 00:09:54,213
Relax, man, the show's
only an hour long.

00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:57,082
Laser ablation
takes, like, six.

00:09:57,149 --> 00:09:58,951
Yeah, but when
they cut it together,

00:09:59,018 --> 00:10:00,786
it'll only take 30 seconds.

00:10:41,927 --> 00:10:44,463
HODGES:
Ran laser ablation on
the duct tape samples.

00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:45,931
Not a match.

00:10:45,998 --> 00:10:48,701
So she wasn't tied up
with the maintenance man's tape.

00:10:48,767 --> 00:10:50,502
Mm-mm.
What about the rest
of the trace?

00:10:50,569 --> 00:10:52,504
White powder was
primarily biological,

00:10:52,571 --> 00:10:54,607
so I kicked it
back to DNA.

00:10:54,673 --> 00:10:56,709
It did contain some
glassy particles.

00:10:56,775 --> 00:10:58,143
Might be industrial
diamonds.

00:10:58,210 --> 00:10:59,445
And the yellow
reflective flakes?

00:10:59,511 --> 00:11:02,548
My next priority.

00:11:02,615 --> 00:11:05,250
( <i>scoffs</i> )
That's a waste
of film.

00:11:05,317 --> 00:11:07,920
JOHNSON:
The victim came out of her
apartment around 5:00 a.m.,

00:11:07,987 --> 00:11:09,688
so I've been
working my way back from then.

00:11:09,755 --> 00:11:13,492
In the previous seven hours,
37 people came and went

00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:16,829
from the 11th floor,
21 of them male.

00:11:16,895 --> 00:11:19,265
So the assailant could
be any one of them...

00:11:19,331 --> 00:11:21,467
assuming that our guy
didn't take the stairs

00:11:21,533 --> 00:11:22,935
which, of course,
aren't monitored.

00:11:23,002 --> 00:11:25,070
Okay, now, here:

00:11:25,137 --> 00:11:28,407
This guy got off on the
vic's floor at 10:32 p.m.

00:11:28,474 --> 00:11:30,809
There's no footage
of him coming back down.

00:11:30,876 --> 00:11:32,044
And check this out.

00:11:32,111 --> 00:11:35,180
( <i>beeping</i> )

00:11:38,684 --> 00:11:39,852
He brought flowers.

00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:41,787
How romantic.

00:11:41,854 --> 00:11:44,556
But I don't think this was
a first date.

00:11:51,463 --> 00:11:54,633
( <i>beeping</i> )

00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,168
Guy had his own key.

00:11:56,235 --> 00:11:59,772
So he could've been with
the victim the whole night.

00:11:59,838 --> 00:12:02,274
Pull the best image
of his face you can,

00:12:02,341 --> 00:12:03,642
and get a
printout to Brass.

00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:04,810
I'm on it.

00:12:04,877 --> 00:12:06,545
PRODUCER:
Ms. Willows,
hold on a second.

00:12:06,612 --> 00:12:08,447
All you have
is a guy's face.

00:12:08,514 --> 00:12:11,016
How do you figure out
who he is?

00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:13,919
Good question.

00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,635

( <i>clears throat</i> )

00:12:24,339 --> 00:12:26,207
So what have you found
so far?

00:12:26,274 --> 00:12:29,978
I lifted two identifiable prints
off the bouquet wrapper.

00:12:30,044 --> 00:12:32,647
How do you know they belong
to the suspect?

00:12:32,714 --> 00:12:36,184
We don't,
but one matched a print found

00:12:36,251 --> 00:12:42,190
on the duct tape, right here,
used to tape up the victim.

00:12:42,257 --> 00:12:45,160
Unfortunately, that print's not
in our database.

00:12:45,226 --> 00:12:48,963
So your suspect
doesn't have a record?

00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,565
Apparently not, no.

00:12:50,632 --> 00:12:53,568
Well, how do you find a guy
who's not in the system?

00:12:53,635 --> 00:12:57,472
( <i>chuckles</i> )
You just got to get creative,
you know?

00:12:57,539 --> 00:13:04,145
I mean, the flowers... came
from a small shop off-strip.

00:13:04,212 --> 00:13:06,781
Took the suspect's image
to the clerk,

00:13:06,848 --> 00:13:08,049
showed it to him.

00:13:08,116 --> 00:13:09,984
He gave me
a credit card receipt.

00:13:10,051 --> 00:13:12,253
From that receipt, I got a name.

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,356
That name gave me
a driver's license.

00:13:15,423 --> 00:13:17,225
Dwight Reynolds.

00:13:17,292 --> 00:13:19,894
Police are bringing him in now.

00:13:19,961 --> 00:13:21,262
Great, okay.

00:13:21,329 --> 00:13:23,031
Clear and concise,
thank you.
Thanks.

00:13:23,098 --> 00:13:25,667
Yeah, well, we have to do it
in court all the time.

00:13:25,734 --> 00:13:27,335
If you can't explain it
to a jury,

00:13:27,402 --> 00:13:29,237
then the bad guy usually walks,

00:13:29,304 --> 00:13:31,773
and we don't like it
when the bad guy walks.

00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,708
CURTIS:
Unit picked him up
at the Double Down.

00:13:33,775 --> 00:13:34,809
He was plastered.

00:13:34,876 --> 00:13:36,010
BRASS:
What'd he blow?

00:13:36,077 --> 00:13:38,113
One nine.

00:13:38,179 --> 00:13:40,048
That's almost enough
to wash away your sins.

00:13:40,115 --> 00:13:42,317
Well, we're going to have
wait until he sobers up.

00:13:42,383 --> 00:13:44,552
No, no, let's not wait,
let's move on this.

00:13:44,619 --> 00:13:46,087
I think we got a chance.

00:13:46,154 --> 00:13:49,524
Look, why don't you come
in there with me, huh?

00:13:49,591 --> 00:13:51,226
Maybe pop a few buttons?

00:13:51,292 --> 00:13:53,027
( <i>chuckles</i> )
No, seriously.

00:13:53,094 --> 00:13:55,797
See how he reacts.

00:13:55,864 --> 00:13:57,565
If he tries too hard
not to look,

00:13:57,632 --> 00:13:59,100
it could be
a guilty conscience?

00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:01,269
Yeah, maybe,
something like that.

00:14:01,336 --> 00:14:03,838
If he is the guy,
and we interview him now,

00:14:03,905 --> 00:14:06,641
anything he says could
be thrown out of court.

00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:08,143
It's worth a try.

00:14:08,209 --> 00:14:13,081
What do you think, huh?

00:14:13,148 --> 00:14:16,351
Let's go.

00:14:22,557 --> 00:14:25,293
How's it going?

00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,494
Okay.

00:14:26,561 --> 00:14:28,763
Did you know
a Christina Hollis?

00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:31,232
Yeah, we used to date.

00:14:31,299 --> 00:14:33,068
You seen her recently?

00:14:33,134 --> 00:14:35,036
No.
Then how come

00:14:35,103 --> 00:14:37,272
we found your prints
on some flowers at her place?

00:14:37,338 --> 00:14:41,242
I dropped some flowers off...
but I didn't see her when I did.

00:14:41,309 --> 00:14:42,710
You had a key?

00:14:42,777 --> 00:14:44,779
Yeah.

00:14:44,846 --> 00:14:46,948
She likes me to come over
sometimes, you know?

00:14:47,015 --> 00:14:48,583
Help her move stuff.

00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,628
Oh, come on, what really
happened, huh?

00:15:00,695 --> 00:15:02,397
You went over
to move some stuff,

00:15:02,464 --> 00:15:05,033
and she wasn't in the mood,
is that it?

00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:08,169
I told you--
I didn't see her.

00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,276
( <i>door rattling</i> )

00:15:15,343 --> 00:15:20,849
( <i>Barry White song</i>
<i>playing inside</i> )

00:15:22,884 --> 00:15:26,054
She was playing Barry White.

00:15:26,121 --> 00:15:27,322
Everybody knows what that means.

00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:32,227
I guess it wasn't my night.
You're lying!

00:15:34,162 --> 00:15:35,964
We found the flowers inside
her apartment, in the trash,

00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:37,399
and you didn't use the elevator
to leave.

00:15:37,465 --> 00:15:39,934
I was pissed.

00:15:40,001 --> 00:15:41,870
I tried to walk it off.

00:15:41,936 --> 00:15:45,473
I figured 11 flights down,
it's better than a cold shower.

00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,543
Christina Hollis was tied up
and brutally assaulted

00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:50,478
in her apartment last night.

00:15:50,545 --> 00:15:51,746
What?

00:15:51,813 --> 00:15:52,947
And you were there.

00:15:53,014 --> 00:15:54,983
Is she...?

00:15:55,049 --> 00:15:56,418
She's alive and talking.

00:15:56,484 --> 00:15:58,553
Last night?

00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,456
The guy who with her was...

00:16:01,523 --> 00:16:03,224
was doing that to her?

00:16:08,363 --> 00:16:10,899
I could've stopped it.

00:16:14,569 --> 00:16:16,805
SIMMS:
So the powder that you found
on the bedroom floor

00:16:16,871 --> 00:16:18,106
was actually
keratinized skin cells.

00:16:18,173 --> 00:16:19,874
They belong to the vic,
and morphology suggests

00:16:19,941 --> 00:16:21,943
that they're probably
from her cuticles.

00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:23,378
Cuticles?
Mm-hmm.

00:16:23,445 --> 00:16:24,879
Nail polish,
diamond particles...

00:16:24,946 --> 00:16:27,348
Maybe she was giving
herself a mani and pedi

00:16:27,415 --> 00:16:28,950
before the assault.

00:16:29,017 --> 00:16:31,619
I don't know about you,
but if I could afford to live

00:16:31,686 --> 00:16:34,089
in an apartment like that,
I'd be in a spa every week.

00:16:34,155 --> 00:16:35,590
Yeah, I hear you there.
Thank you.

00:16:35,657 --> 00:16:36,825
Mm-hmm.

00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:41,996
Wendy ran the semen,
no hits in CODIS.

00:16:42,063 --> 00:16:44,232
Yeah, the, uh...
ex-boyfriend

00:16:44,299 --> 00:16:46,701
didn't match any of the prints
on the duct tape, either.

00:16:46,768 --> 00:16:50,505
SAE found oral,
vaginal and anal smears
positive for semen.

00:16:50,572 --> 00:16:54,242
Degraded and intact sperm
suggests multiple deposits.

00:16:54,309 --> 00:16:56,511
Which means that
he probably raped her

00:16:56,578 --> 00:16:58,747
on and off,
for a long time.

00:16:58,813 --> 00:17:03,017
Yeah, well, tox came back--
lorazepam in the vic's blood.

00:17:03,084 --> 00:17:05,253
I didn't find any
prescription bottles
in her apartment.

00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,921
No, nor did I.

00:17:06,988 --> 00:17:09,324
Lorazepam is
a hypnotic sedative,

00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:11,526
and I know in high doses,
it causes acute amnesia.

00:17:11,593 --> 00:17:14,062
Maybe that's what he was
counting on to cover his tracks.

00:17:14,129 --> 00:17:17,265
Well, it usually takes an hour
for a drug like that to kick in.

00:17:17,332 --> 00:17:20,201
How did he subdue her
in the meantime?

00:17:20,268 --> 00:17:22,704
Low-profile entry, sedatives,
duct tape--

00:17:22,771 --> 00:17:25,974
I mean, if he's not a serial,
he will be soon.

00:17:36,084 --> 00:17:37,952
Hey, there, gorgeous.

00:17:38,019 --> 00:17:39,754
I'm going to be running
with the trace

00:17:39,821 --> 00:17:41,222
from the victim's
apartment.

00:17:41,289 --> 00:17:43,024
Would you mind bringing
me up to speed?

00:17:43,091 --> 00:17:44,759
Certainly.

00:17:44,826 --> 00:17:46,628
Take your time.

00:17:48,096 --> 00:17:49,264
PRODUCER:
Did you page us?

00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:52,100
Um...
No. Mm-mm.

00:17:53,701 --> 00:17:55,703
According to the gas
chromatograph

00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:57,238
mass spectrometer,

00:17:57,305 --> 00:18:00,208
the glossy red drop you found
on the footboard was...

00:18:00,275 --> 00:18:02,210
nail polish.

00:18:02,277 --> 00:18:05,480
Well, that's not unusual
in a woman's apartment.

00:18:05,547 --> 00:18:09,784
What is far more intriguing
is the reflective yellow flakes.

00:18:09,851 --> 00:18:13,188
Follow me to the Fourier
Transform Infrared Microscope.

00:18:13,254 --> 00:18:14,422
Hodges, what's wrong
with you?

00:18:14,489 --> 00:18:15,924
Nothing.

00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:18,593
PRODUCER ( <i>whispering):</i>
Guys... stay with the girl.

00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:27,469
As you can see, the flakes are
fluorescent reflective lenses

00:18:27,535 --> 00:18:30,638
bonded to an aramid backing
by a special polymer layer.

00:18:30,705 --> 00:18:33,074
And it's used exclusively

00:18:33,141 --> 00:18:35,944
in the reflective trim
of firemen's turnouts.

00:18:37,846 --> 00:18:39,347
You're telling me there
was a firefighter

00:18:39,414 --> 00:18:41,049
in the victim's bedroom.

00:18:43,752 --> 00:18:45,019
Hmm...

00:18:45,086 --> 00:18:47,155
Thanks.
Thanks, Hodges.

00:18:47,222 --> 00:18:49,390
Anytime.

00:18:56,364 --> 00:18:59,200
Yeah, all right, okay,
let 'em roll.

00:18:59,267 --> 00:19:00,769
But you're buying
the lobster.

00:19:00,835 --> 00:19:01,770
Yeah, right.

00:19:01,836 --> 00:19:03,905
See, one of the guys
gets on TV,

00:19:03,972 --> 00:19:06,941
that guy has to buy lobster for
the whole company, you know?

00:19:07,008 --> 00:19:10,378
These guys eat well--
lobster thermidor!

00:19:10,445 --> 00:19:11,913
Check it out.

00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:15,250
So, according to dispatch,
you responded to an alarm

00:19:15,316 --> 00:19:17,051
at the Omni condos
last night?

00:19:17,118 --> 00:19:18,853
Yeah, at 6:58 p.m.

00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,955
We were on scene in
about four minutes.

00:19:21,022 --> 00:19:23,324
Three smoke bombs on three
different floors,

00:19:23,391 --> 00:19:24,659
three pains in my ass.

00:19:24,726 --> 00:19:26,428
There's no major damage,
just paint and wallpaper.

00:19:26,494 --> 00:19:27,929
We were there
about a half hour.

00:19:27,996 --> 00:19:29,597
What'd the arson guys find?

00:19:29,664 --> 00:19:31,666
They didn't find much.

00:19:31,733 --> 00:19:34,069
The smoke bombs were made
out of soda cans.

00:19:34,135 --> 00:19:36,204
Kids, Internet, you do the math.

00:19:36,271 --> 00:19:37,272
It's all in your lab.

00:19:37,338 --> 00:19:39,641
Really? What for?

00:19:39,707 --> 00:19:41,443
A couple guys from
the day shift were gonna

00:19:41,509 --> 00:19:43,278
compare 'em to those bombs we
found a couple of weeks ago.

00:19:43,344 --> 00:19:45,447
What are you talking about?

00:19:45,513 --> 00:19:46,948
Apartment building
over on Paradise.

00:19:47,015 --> 00:19:49,150
Smoke bombs started a fire,
one woman died.

00:19:49,217 --> 00:19:50,785
We still don't have a suspect
in that.

00:19:50,852 --> 00:19:53,188
BRASS:
Were you on the scene?

00:19:53,254 --> 00:19:55,156
CAPTAIN:
I saw it after.

00:19:55,223 --> 00:19:58,293
Smoke bomb was too close
to the wall, the whole place...

00:20:04,766 --> 00:20:07,635
Which of your guys were up on
the 11th floor at the Omni?

00:20:07,702 --> 00:20:09,671
I don't know.
I'd have to ask around. Why?

00:20:09,738 --> 00:20:11,773
A woman was raped
last night.

00:20:13,775 --> 00:20:15,910
You think
one of my guys did it?

00:20:15,977 --> 00:20:17,912
I'm not saying that,
but we found some evidence

00:20:17,979 --> 00:20:19,481
that a fireman
was near her bed.

00:20:19,547 --> 00:20:22,784
You came here to accuse
my guys of this in
front of the camera?

00:20:22,851 --> 00:20:24,352
No, no, no.
Settle down, settle down...

00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:25,587
The hell I will.

00:20:28,156 --> 00:20:30,658
No wonder they call you Brass,
because you really got a set.

00:20:30,725 --> 00:20:31,960
Aw, come on, Sparky...

00:20:32,026 --> 00:20:33,395
SIDLE:
Excuse me, gentlemen.

00:20:33,461 --> 00:20:35,630
Captain, uh,
which of your guys...

00:20:35,697 --> 00:20:37,699
wears a yellow reflective stripe
on their turnouts?

00:20:37,766 --> 00:20:40,001
Nobody; department's
color is orange.

00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,505
SIDLE:
The reflective flake we found

00:20:43,571 --> 00:20:47,075
in Christina Hollis' apartment
was yellow.

00:20:47,142 --> 00:20:50,044
Then you're not looking for
a Las Vegas fireman.

00:20:50,111 --> 00:20:51,446
JOHNSON:
According to surveillance,

00:20:51,513 --> 00:20:54,482
the victim came home
at 6:19 p.m.

00:20:54,549 --> 00:20:57,085
And the firemen were
in her building

00:20:57,152 --> 00:20:59,621
at approximately 7:00.

00:20:59,687 --> 00:21:03,525
They took the stairs, so we
don't have them on this camera.

00:21:03,591 --> 00:21:05,960
Now take a look at this...

00:21:08,563 --> 00:21:11,633
WILLOWS:
Well, he certainly
looks the part.

00:21:11,699 --> 00:21:14,369
He touched the door
with his bare hands.

00:21:14,436 --> 00:21:16,604
Might get prints.

00:21:18,473 --> 00:21:21,076
The time code says 6:36 p.m.

00:21:21,142 --> 00:21:23,578
but the alarm went out at 6:58.

00:21:23,645 --> 00:21:26,114
That's 22 minutes later.

00:21:26,181 --> 00:21:28,516
What kind of fireman
comes <i>before</i> the fire?

00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:31,186
Someone who knows
it's coming.

00:21:32,687 --> 00:21:34,956
PRODUCER:
Uh, Mr. Grissom, we may
have missed that.

00:21:35,023 --> 00:21:37,225
Could you say it one
more time for camera?

00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:43,661
( <i>indistinct conversation</i> )

00:21:43,727 --> 00:21:44,625
PRODUCER:
You ever hear
the saying,

00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:46,661
"Only the dumb
ones get caught?"

00:21:46,727 --> 00:21:47,862
Yeah...

00:21:47,929 --> 00:21:50,464
but we catch
the smart ones, too.

00:21:50,531 --> 00:21:52,733
And this guy's
definitely smart.

00:21:54,435 --> 00:21:56,871
<i>He lights smoke bombs</i>
<i>on three different floors</i>

00:21:56,938 --> 00:21:59,540
<i>so as not to call attention</i>
<i>to his target.</i>

00:21:59,607 --> 00:22:05,279
Victim sees the smoke, sees him,
and opens the door.

00:22:11,085 --> 00:22:13,888
( <i>knocking</i> )
!
Fire department,
open up.

00:22:13,955 --> 00:22:16,491
I mean, who wouldn't
trust a fireman, right?

00:22:21,996 --> 00:22:25,867
CURTIS:
It takes a lot of
courage to do this.

00:22:25,933 --> 00:22:27,635
Thank you.

00:22:27,702 --> 00:22:29,504
And if you change your mind
about the camera,

00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:31,172
all you have to do
is say so--

00:22:31,239 --> 00:22:34,075
no one ever
has to see this.

00:22:34,141 --> 00:22:37,111
No, I want <i>him</i> to see it.

00:22:37,178 --> 00:22:40,581
He'll watch it
in jail.

00:22:40,648 --> 00:22:43,484
Okay, so,
you said you were

00:22:43,551 --> 00:22:46,587
beginning to remember
what happened?

00:22:46,654 --> 00:22:48,055
Yeah, a little.

00:22:49,824 --> 00:22:51,759
Can you tell me
what he looked like?

00:22:55,863 --> 00:22:57,398
Um...

00:22:58,699 --> 00:23:01,102
No, not really.

00:23:01,169 --> 00:23:06,107
It's mostly, uh...
just feelings.

00:23:06,174 --> 00:23:08,276
Feelings.

00:23:08,342 --> 00:23:09,377
Of what?

00:23:12,346 --> 00:23:14,849
I know he raped me.

00:23:20,288 --> 00:23:24,258
What I remember
most...

00:23:24,325 --> 00:23:26,761
it was, um...

00:23:39,907 --> 00:23:41,442
( <i>sniffling</i> )

00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:45,012
He...

00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:47,114
He kept...

00:23:47,181 --> 00:23:49,717
He kept touching
my feet.

00:23:53,654 --> 00:23:54,856
( <i>sniffling</i> )

00:23:54,922 --> 00:23:57,024
He kept touching
my feet.

00:24:04,398 --> 00:24:06,901
( <i>police sirens wailing</i> )

00:24:06,968 --> 00:24:09,770
A foot fetish is
a visual pathology.

00:24:09,837 --> 00:24:12,273
The suspect would have had
to be close enough to the vic

00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:14,876
to see her toes
and then get aroused.

00:24:14,942 --> 00:24:16,143
We live in a desert, Gil.

00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:17,778
You want to see
a woman's bare feet,

00:24:17,845 --> 00:24:19,480
all you have to do
is look down.

00:24:26,521 --> 00:24:29,056
( <i>footsteps approaching</i> )

00:24:29,123 --> 00:24:30,458
Door in the
parking structure

00:24:30,525 --> 00:24:32,527
was like the arm
of a slot machine:

00:24:32,593 --> 00:24:34,095
smudge city.

00:24:34,162 --> 00:24:36,230
Anything useful
from the janitor?

00:24:36,297 --> 00:24:37,765
Yeah, he gave us
a full description.

00:24:37,832 --> 00:24:39,100
Said he looked
like a fireman.

00:24:39,167 --> 00:24:40,902
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:24:40,968 --> 00:24:42,670
Well, between eBay,
uniform shops,

00:24:42,737 --> 00:24:44,572
and national manufacturers,

00:24:44,639 --> 00:24:46,374
there's about a hundred
different places

00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,875
that you can buy
yellow-striped turnouts.

00:24:47,942 --> 00:24:50,811
Maybe he was a fireman
in another city.

00:24:50,878 --> 00:24:52,013
Maybe.

00:24:53,381 --> 00:24:54,882
What's that?

00:24:54,949 --> 00:24:56,784
When I was at
the firehouse,

00:24:56,851 --> 00:24:59,153
all of the air tanks
were rigged

00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,122
with the valves on the bottom,
like this one.

00:25:01,189 --> 00:25:03,958
But our guy...

00:25:04,025 --> 00:25:05,159
his valve is on top.

00:25:06,894 --> 00:25:08,763
A real fireman probably
wouldn't make that mistake.

00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:11,098
His air line isn't even
rigged to his mask.

00:25:11,165 --> 00:25:13,868
It's rigged to
a second mask
on his side.

00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:17,839
Maybe he put something
in the tank to subdue her.

00:25:17,905 --> 00:25:20,007
He used lorazepam.

00:25:20,074 --> 00:25:21,542
Eventually.

00:25:21,609 --> 00:25:23,444
But this guy was
somehow able to get her

00:25:23,511 --> 00:25:25,980
from the door to the bed
without a struggle.

00:25:28,049 --> 00:25:29,650
I bet he used nitrous oxide.

00:25:31,252 --> 00:25:32,787
That stuff will knock you out
real fast.

00:25:38,526 --> 00:25:41,295
And it's undetectable in
the blood after a few minutes.

00:25:41,362 --> 00:25:42,797
Pretty easy to come by.

00:25:42,864 --> 00:25:46,334
And it would explain
the valve on top.

00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,002
It's liquid under pressure.

00:25:48,069 --> 00:25:50,204
It would spill
if it were upside down.

00:25:50,271 --> 00:25:51,939
All you need is
a driver's license

00:25:52,006 --> 00:25:53,341
and a deposit
for the tank.

00:25:53,407 --> 00:25:56,944
If this guy
bought nitrous from
a local distributor,

00:25:57,011 --> 00:25:59,180
there's definitely
a record.

00:25:59,247 --> 00:26:00,882
Check it out.

00:26:00,948 --> 00:26:02,383
Come on, Tina.

00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:04,952
Like, I'm the only one
working doubles here.

00:26:07,522 --> 00:26:11,359
Oh, so it's my fault
that we have strange schedules.

00:26:13,594 --> 00:26:15,730
Great. Go out with your friends.

00:26:15,796 --> 00:26:18,466
I'm sure you'll be seeing Robert
again tonight, too, huh?

00:26:19,834 --> 00:26:21,335
You know what?

00:26:21,402 --> 00:26:22,670
It's fine.

00:26:22,737 --> 00:26:24,272
I got to go.

00:26:24,338 --> 00:26:26,774
Have a fun time.

00:26:26,841 --> 00:26:28,709
PRODUCER:
This a bad time?

00:26:28,776 --> 00:26:32,113
No. Great time.
What can I do for you?

00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,448
What are
you working on?

00:26:34,515 --> 00:26:38,953
I'm examining smoke bombs
recovered from, uh...

00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:41,389
the victim'scondo,
and comparing them

00:26:41,455 --> 00:26:43,257
to smoke bombs
from an arson case

00:26:43,324 --> 00:26:45,493
a couple of weeks ago.

00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,161
How do you know
which is which?

00:26:47,228 --> 00:26:49,430
I mean, how do
you tell them apart?

00:26:49,497 --> 00:26:54,669
Well, so far, I've only opened
up one item from each case.

00:26:54,735 --> 00:26:56,804
CSIs, when we work a case,

00:26:56,871 --> 00:26:59,507
we take extensive notes
at the scene,

00:26:59,574 --> 00:27:02,844
and photos of each item.

00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:08,583
And, uh... they're
very similar, I know.

00:27:08,649 --> 00:27:13,888
But, based on the construction
and the components,

00:27:13,955 --> 00:27:17,291
I'd say these two bombs
were made by the same person.

00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:27,101
PRODUCER:
So I guess this is a
slow day at the morgue.

00:27:27,168 --> 00:27:29,770
You can't really
predict this job.

00:27:29,837 --> 00:27:32,707
Today it's like this,
tomorrow it's a bus accident.

00:27:32,773 --> 00:27:34,742
So I am here.

00:27:34,809 --> 00:27:36,377
Albert.
Yeah?

00:27:36,444 --> 00:27:38,846
Did you find
the blood sample
I called you about?

00:27:38,913 --> 00:27:41,916
Female arson fatality.
C.O.D. is smoke inhalation.

00:27:41,983 --> 00:27:45,553
Partial tox came back
carboxyhemoglobin and cyanide.

00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:48,089
I need a test
for lorazepam.

00:27:48,156 --> 00:27:50,291
Blood's on its way to Tox.

00:27:50,358 --> 00:27:52,727
You recall any other
sexual assault victims

00:27:52,793 --> 00:27:55,329
that tested positive
for lorazepam?

00:27:55,396 --> 00:27:57,798
Uh... Nothing comes to mind,
but I'll check my files,

00:27:57,865 --> 00:27:59,700
confer with Toxicology.

00:27:59,767 --> 00:28:00,701
Thanks.

00:28:00,768 --> 00:28:02,370
Yeah.

00:28:02,436 --> 00:28:05,239
A slow day is a good day.

00:28:05,306 --> 00:28:07,775
These people lived
on the same floor

00:28:07,842 --> 00:28:10,344
as the female arson fatality
from two weeks ago.

00:28:10,411 --> 00:28:11,879
Tox on the
arson victim

00:28:11,946 --> 00:28:13,981
came back negative
for lorazepam.

00:28:14,048 --> 00:28:16,284
So maybe she
wasn't the target.

00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:18,986
PRODUCER:
Ms. Sidle, is this
what you guys call
a "fishing expedition"?

00:28:19,053 --> 00:28:20,822
We call this
following a lead.

00:28:20,888 --> 00:28:23,524
Forgive me, but it's
not very much of a lead.

00:28:23,591 --> 00:28:25,026
What's that supposed to mean?

00:28:25,092 --> 00:28:27,695
Well, this case is even
colder than the one <i>you'reon.</i>

00:28:27,762 --> 00:28:28,930
You'd almost be better off

00:28:28,996 --> 00:28:31,299
if you had a new rape victim
and a fresh scene.

00:28:31,365 --> 00:28:34,569
That might be true,
but that is definitely

00:28:34,635 --> 00:28:37,638
not the outcome
that we're looking for.

00:28:46,314 --> 00:28:48,816
WOMAN:
<i>I didn't really know</i>
<i>the girl who died.</i>

00:28:48,883 --> 00:28:50,918
I still can't
believe what happened.

00:28:50,985 --> 00:28:52,420
It's just awful.

00:28:52,487 --> 00:28:53,988
Tell me what
you remember.

00:28:55,957 --> 00:28:57,725
I was alone in my apartment
Saturday night.

00:28:57,792 --> 00:29:00,228
Hello. What's new, right?

00:29:00,294 --> 00:29:01,729
I was reading or something.

00:29:01,796 --> 00:29:03,231
<i>And then, suddenly,</i>

00:29:03,297 --> 00:29:05,666
<i>there was someone pounding</i>
<i>on my door.</i>

00:29:13,241 --> 00:29:15,610
Can you describe
what he looked like?

00:29:15,676 --> 00:29:17,678
Well, he was fireman.

00:29:17,745 --> 00:29:19,814
I mean, he was wearing a mask.

00:29:19,881 --> 00:29:22,383
It all happened
pretty quick.

00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:25,319
Why?

00:29:25,386 --> 00:29:29,991
We're looking for a rapist
who masquerades as a fireman.

00:29:30,057 --> 00:29:32,727
He uses smoke bombs
to get

00:29:32,793 --> 00:29:35,029
his victims to open their doors.

00:29:36,864 --> 00:29:38,366
He knocked on my door.

00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:42,003
Are you saying you think
he was going to rape me?

00:29:42,069 --> 00:29:43,771
It's possible.

00:29:43,838 --> 00:29:48,009
You know, I was pretty freaked.

00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:52,813
<i>When he was standing there</i>
<i>in front of me...</i>

00:29:56,417 --> 00:29:57,919
<i>Just before he left,</i>

00:29:57,985 --> 00:30:01,422
I swear, for a second,

00:30:01,489 --> 00:30:04,559
it felt like he wasn't
going to let me go.

00:30:09,792 --> 00:30:11,393
Turnouts were a dead end.

00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:14,096
And there's nothing to track
off of the smoke bombs.

00:30:14,163 --> 00:30:15,798
I've got hundreds
of names of people

00:30:15,864 --> 00:30:18,267
who purchased
nitrous oxide in
the last six months.

00:30:18,333 --> 00:30:20,402
What? You got
to narrow that down.

00:30:20,469 --> 00:30:22,504
That is narrowed down.

00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,408
Okay. Our rapist
is a foot fetishist.

00:30:26,475 --> 00:30:27,910
That's what gets him off.

00:30:27,976 --> 00:30:30,846
He has to see his
victim's feet somewhere.

00:30:30,913 --> 00:30:34,083
If we can figure out where,
maybe we can find him.

00:30:34,149 --> 00:30:36,518
What do the victims
have in common?

00:30:38,354 --> 00:30:40,723
Christina Hollis.

00:30:40,789 --> 00:30:42,858
African American. Single.

00:30:42,925 --> 00:30:44,493
Lives and works
at the Omni.

00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,729
She lives on the 11th floor,

00:30:46,795 --> 00:30:49,431
so there's no real way
for a peeper to see in.

00:30:49,498 --> 00:30:51,633
And she uses

00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,001
the gym, but not the pool.

00:30:53,068 --> 00:30:54,336
Stephanie Daniels

00:30:54,403 --> 00:30:57,172
lives across town.
Caucasian. Also single.

00:30:57,239 --> 00:30:58,374
No gym membership,

00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,908
but she does use the pool

00:30:59,975 --> 00:31:01,377
at her apartment complex
regularly.

00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:04,179
There's a couple
of adjacent buildings.

00:31:04,246 --> 00:31:05,414
It's possible that
somebody could see

00:31:05,481 --> 00:31:06,648
into her place
with a telescope,

00:31:06,715 --> 00:31:08,984
but she has shades and curtains.

00:31:09,051 --> 00:31:11,186
I kind of doubt it.

00:31:11,253 --> 00:31:13,555
So they have
nothing in common.

00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:16,625
Sure, they do.
They both have feet.

00:31:16,692 --> 00:31:19,528
We may have
a third victim

00:31:19,595 --> 00:31:21,797
who may also
be our first victim.

00:31:21,864 --> 00:31:23,465
Tara Weathers. Last month,

00:31:23,532 --> 00:31:25,401
she claimed
she was drugged in a bar

00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:28,904
and woke up in her apartment
with her toes freshly painted.

00:31:28,971 --> 00:31:31,407
They did a tox
on her at the time.

00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:33,642
Found lorazepam in her system.

00:31:36,578 --> 00:31:38,981
Well, she does have nice feet.

00:31:39,048 --> 00:31:41,550
And the nail polish
looks like a similar shade

00:31:41,617 --> 00:31:43,052
to Christina Hollis'.

00:31:43,118 --> 00:31:45,421
Yeah. So the pattern starts
a month ago.

00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:47,823
Our guy drugs Tara Weathers
in a bar,

00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:49,658
takes her
to her apartment,

00:31:49,725 --> 00:31:51,860
paints her toes, leaves.

00:31:51,927 --> 00:31:54,363
Two weeks later, he steps it up.

00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:55,831
Poses as a firefighter,

00:31:55,898 --> 00:31:57,933
places smoke bombs
in an apartment building,

00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,101
only things don't work out

00:31:59,168 --> 00:32:00,369
the way that
he planned.

00:32:00,436 --> 00:32:01,437
The building
catches fire,

00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:03,038
and he runs.

00:32:03,105 --> 00:32:04,973
He waits a couple more weeks,

00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,175
he does it again,

00:32:06,241 --> 00:32:08,043
but this time
he goes all the way.

00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:09,912
Yeah. And now he's escalating.

00:32:09,978 --> 00:32:12,114
Where does he go from here?

00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:18,420
Tara Weathers?

00:32:18,487 --> 00:32:20,589
I'm Jim Brass,
Las Vegas Police.

00:32:20,656 --> 00:32:22,291
This is Catherine Willows
from the Crime Lab.

00:32:22,358 --> 00:32:23,625
What do you want?

00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:25,928
Well, we're here to ask you
about the incident

00:32:25,994 --> 00:32:27,529
you reported to
the police last month.

00:32:27,596 --> 00:32:28,630
The nail polish thing?

00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:29,798
Yeah, the nail polish thing.

00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:31,633
You guys said I should
consider myself lucky,

00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,102
that there was
no real crime anyway.

00:32:33,168 --> 00:32:35,404
Well, we may have
been wrong about that.

00:32:35,471 --> 00:32:38,640
I knew it, that's what I tried
to tell you the first time.

00:32:41,677 --> 00:32:42,945
BRASS:
<i>The guy who drugged you</i>

00:32:43,012 --> 00:32:44,913
is a rapist
and a murderer,

00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:47,182
and we're looking to stop him
before he does it again.

00:32:47,249 --> 00:32:48,217
Are you serious?

00:32:48,283 --> 00:32:49,218
Very.

00:32:49,284 --> 00:32:50,552
We're trying to understand

00:32:50,619 --> 00:32:52,521
what you have in common
with the other victims

00:32:52,588 --> 00:32:53,822
that might lead us to him.

00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:55,424
Now he has a foot fetish.

00:32:55,491 --> 00:32:56,892
He's into feet.

00:32:56,959 --> 00:33:00,095
Is there any way that
he could've... seen your feet?

00:33:00,162 --> 00:33:01,930
Um...

00:33:01,997 --> 00:33:04,466
I-I... I don't know.

00:33:04,533 --> 00:33:05,768
Where do you
buy your shoes?

00:33:05,834 --> 00:33:07,269
All over.

00:33:07,336 --> 00:33:09,471
Do you go to a gym?
No, not really.

00:33:09,538 --> 00:33:10,639
Pool?

00:33:10,706 --> 00:33:12,808
No, never.
I burn easily.

00:33:12,875 --> 00:33:14,743
I'm a legal secretary,
I don't get out much.

00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:18,013
My work starts early
and it goes late.

00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,214
The firm is so conservative,

00:33:19,281 --> 00:33:21,750
we're not even allowed
to wear open-toed shoes.

00:33:21,817 --> 00:33:23,852
I notice that you do yoga.

00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:24,953
Yeah.

00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,021
Where?

00:33:26,088 --> 00:33:27,189
Out on the balcony.

00:33:27,256 --> 00:33:29,391
It's practically the only
fresh air I get.

00:33:43,338 --> 00:33:44,506
Anybody in those apartments

00:33:44,573 --> 00:33:47,309
has a clear view
of her bare feet.

00:33:47,376 --> 00:33:50,446
PRODUCER:
So how'd you get the warrant?

00:33:50,512 --> 00:33:53,949
The tenant's name was
on the nitrous oxide list.

00:33:54,016 --> 00:33:55,017
Las Vegas Police.

00:33:55,084 --> 00:33:57,586
Open up,
we have a warrant.

00:33:57,653 --> 00:33:59,655
Open up, police.

00:33:59,722 --> 00:34:01,023
Open it.

00:34:03,892 --> 00:34:05,160
Let's go.

00:34:05,227 --> 00:34:07,262
No, no, no, you're not
going in there, no.

00:34:07,329 --> 00:34:09,398
Can you please take this in,
it's a flashlight cam.

00:34:09,465 --> 00:34:11,233
It'll record anything
you point it at.

00:34:13,168 --> 00:34:14,403
All clear.

00:34:15,604 --> 00:34:16,739
Thanks.

00:34:32,121 --> 00:34:34,590
Perfect view of Tara's balcony.

00:34:43,932 --> 00:34:47,336
Yoga flyers from all over town.

00:34:51,073 --> 00:34:54,610
Guy's got everything he needs
for a pedicure.

00:35:08,791 --> 00:35:11,160
Hey, check this out.

00:35:12,995 --> 00:35:15,464
God bless the internet.

00:36:00,976 --> 00:36:03,379
Fireman's air tank case.

00:36:07,983 --> 00:36:09,518
Where's the tank?

00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:18,060
( <i>cell phone blips</i> )

00:36:18,127 --> 00:36:20,262
Yeah, this is Brass.

00:36:20,329 --> 00:36:22,464
I want to put a broadcast out
on Richard McQueen.

00:36:22,531 --> 00:36:25,000
That's M-C-Q-U-E-E-N.

00:36:25,067 --> 00:36:27,302
Copy.
( <i>cell phone blips</i> )

00:36:27,369 --> 00:36:28,871
Candle wax on the camera.

00:37:02,304 --> 00:37:04,440
There, send it to the monitor.

00:37:11,213 --> 00:37:13,282
( <i>siren</i> )

00:37:13,349 --> 00:37:15,017

00:37:15,084 --> 00:37:18,354
( <i>sirens</i> )

00:37:22,891 --> 00:37:24,693
( <i>grunting</i> ):
Stay down!

00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,095
Las Vegas P.D.!

00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:28,397
Las Vegas P.D.,
break it up!

00:37:28,464 --> 00:37:29,631
Break it up!

00:37:29,698 --> 00:37:31,433
What the hell's
going on here?
Smoke bombs.

00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,801
We caught this creep
sneaking away.

00:37:32,868 --> 00:37:35,204
My guys tried to stop him.

00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:37,339
She wouldn't let me
touch her feet.

00:37:37,406 --> 00:37:39,141
You should see
what he did?

00:37:49,018 --> 00:37:50,753
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:38:15,177 --> 00:38:17,513
Women are four times
more likely than men

00:38:17,579 --> 00:38:19,648
to be the victims
of a sex-related murder.

00:38:19,715 --> 00:38:22,117
And men are ten times
more likely than women

00:38:22,184 --> 00:38:23,352
to be the murderer.

00:38:23,419 --> 00:38:25,354
It's just the way it is.

00:38:44,606 --> 00:38:46,742
Is that your daughter?

00:38:46,809 --> 00:38:49,445
Oh, yeah, these
are old pictures.

00:38:49,511 --> 00:38:51,246
She's a teenager now.

00:38:51,313 --> 00:38:53,148
With all the things
you see on this job,

00:38:53,215 --> 00:38:54,683
do you ever worry about her?

00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:56,251
Are you kidding?

00:38:56,318 --> 00:38:58,687
I keep a vial of her
blood in my freezer.

00:38:58,754 --> 00:39:04,426
Like as a DNA sample in case
you need to identify her?

00:39:04,493 --> 00:39:07,730
Well...

00:39:07,796 --> 00:39:10,632
One thing you learn
doing this job

00:39:10,699 --> 00:39:14,737
is that bad things happen
to people who never expect it...

00:39:14,803 --> 00:39:16,739
every day.

00:39:26,315 --> 00:39:28,183
Yeah, we got a confession.

00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:30,152
He didn't choose women's feet,

00:39:30,219 --> 00:39:31,687
women's feet chose him.

00:39:31,754 --> 00:39:33,822
He lit candles, he played music,

00:39:33,889 --> 00:39:35,257
he thought he was on a date.

00:39:35,324 --> 00:39:37,593
But did he explain,
you know, why he did it?

00:39:37,659 --> 00:39:39,461
Oh, yeah. Oh, sure.

00:39:39,528 --> 00:39:40,863
His mother was a hooker,

00:39:40,929 --> 00:39:43,532
she put him under the bed
when she did her business,

00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:46,001
her feet dangled
over the edge of the bed.

00:39:46,068 --> 00:39:48,804
He watched her feet,
they were perfect.

00:39:48,871 --> 00:39:50,572
You know, I don't know
if it's true.

00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:53,375
What about
the fireman thing?

00:39:53,442 --> 00:39:56,745
I don't know, I guess he wanted
to be a fireman when he grew up.

00:39:56,812 --> 00:39:59,048
Didn't you?

00:39:59,114 --> 00:40:01,750
Look, juries love explanations,
they want it nice and neat.

00:40:01,817 --> 00:40:04,586
They don't want to know
we live in a random world,

00:40:04,653 --> 00:40:06,121
they want meaning.

00:40:06,188 --> 00:40:08,290
It's that simple.

00:40:08,357 --> 00:40:10,359
So how do you cope
with a day like today?

00:40:10,426 --> 00:40:12,861
What do you do?

00:40:12,928 --> 00:40:15,998
What do you want me to tell you,
that I go home, I get drunk,

00:40:16,065 --> 00:40:18,067
I go to a bar,
I stay out all night,

00:40:18,133 --> 00:40:21,170
I don't sleep... huh?

00:40:21,236 --> 00:40:22,971
That's not the truth.
You know what happens?

00:40:23,038 --> 00:40:25,674
I take care of myself,
I sleep very well.

00:40:25,741 --> 00:40:27,309
How well did you sleep
after you learned

00:40:27,376 --> 00:40:30,512
you killed that fellow officer
in that shootout last year?

00:40:36,452 --> 00:40:38,020
Uh, yeah.

00:40:38,087 --> 00:40:39,254
Oh, is this... is that...

00:40:39,321 --> 00:40:40,723
Oh, is this what this is about?

00:40:40,789 --> 00:40:42,791
Who've you been talking to, huh?

00:40:42,858 --> 00:40:44,393
What, you come here
with your camera

00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:45,828
and you roll
a little film and...

00:40:45,894 --> 00:40:48,297
what, you think you know
what it's like to be a cop?

00:40:48,364 --> 00:40:50,999
You?

00:40:51,066 --> 00:40:53,335
You're all done.
You're all done with this.

00:40:53,402 --> 00:40:55,337
Get out of here.

00:40:58,674 --> 00:41:00,743
The truth is
if there isn't any evidence,

00:41:00,809 --> 00:41:02,044
we have nowhere to go.

00:41:02,111 --> 00:41:04,380
So you feel you did
the best you could?

00:41:04,446 --> 00:41:05,981
Yes, I do.

00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:07,416
Do you think
forensic shows

00:41:07,483 --> 00:41:08,851
are just teaching
the criminals

00:41:08,917 --> 00:41:10,753
how to get away
with crimes?

00:41:10,819 --> 00:41:13,389
Everyone learns from science.

00:41:13,455 --> 00:41:16,358
It all depends
on how you use the knowledge.

00:41:19,928 --> 00:41:21,597
( <i>camera beeps</i> )

00:41:21,663 --> 00:41:23,250
Keep going, go inside
for a close-up.
