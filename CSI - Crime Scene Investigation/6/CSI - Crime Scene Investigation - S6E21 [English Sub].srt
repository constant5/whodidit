00:09:43,986 --> 00:09:45,888
You are aware that
someone has died?

00:09:45,954 --> 00:09:48,290
Nobody's going to miss her
except her son

00:09:48,357 --> 00:09:50,025
and her cell phone provider.

00:09:50,092 --> 00:09:51,794
Oh, what do you mean?

00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,128
She's creepy close to Adam.

00:09:53,195 --> 00:09:55,230
Must have called him
15 times a day.

00:09:55,297 --> 00:09:56,732
Huh.

00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:59,668
Do you mind just putting
your finger right here?

00:09:59,735 --> 00:10:00,669
Oh! Okay, Mr. Gundy...

00:10:00,736 --> 00:10:02,237
I think I love you.

00:10:02,304 --> 00:10:04,139
Yeah, thank you.
You need to sit down.

00:10:04,206 --> 00:10:05,341
Have a club soda.

00:10:05,407 --> 00:10:10,612
Um, um, excuse me,
you dropped this.

00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:11,814
Sorry about him.
( <i>laughing</i> )

00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,716
Why do the jerks
get all the tail?

00:10:13,782 --> 00:10:16,485
Sara Sidle, crime lab.

00:10:16,552 --> 00:10:20,155
I'm, uh, Mikey. Best man.
Brother of the bride.

00:10:20,222 --> 00:10:22,157
Yeah, it's, you know.
Yeah.

00:10:22,224 --> 00:10:24,927
Hey, this is a pretty
crazy-ass situation, huh?

00:10:24,994 --> 00:10:26,895
They say it's good luck

00:10:26,962 --> 00:10:28,230
if it rains on
your wedding day.

00:10:28,297 --> 00:10:29,832
What do you think
about a dead body?

00:10:29,898 --> 00:10:31,667
What do you think?

00:10:31,734 --> 00:10:33,669
I think my sister's
better off.

00:10:33,736 --> 00:10:35,037
You ever think
about getting married?

00:10:35,104 --> 00:10:36,739
Um...
I'm just saying,
you know,

00:10:36,805 --> 00:10:39,041
I think Bryce could make
an honest woman out of you.

00:10:39,108 --> 00:10:40,242
( <i>laughing</i> )

00:10:40,309 --> 00:10:41,243
Oh, look at that--

00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:42,845
your rejection broke
his little heart.

00:10:42,911 --> 00:10:44,913
STOKES:
<i>Should I put flirting</i>
<i>in the case file?</i>

00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:47,282
I was printing.

00:10:47,349 --> 00:10:50,686
He was flirting.

00:10:50,753 --> 00:10:53,355
Uni found the tracking
device from Nick's car

00:10:53,422 --> 00:10:56,158
in a trash can,
a couple blocks from the diner.

00:10:56,225 --> 00:10:57,626
Pro job.

00:10:57,693 --> 00:10:59,662
Has it been to Prints?
Well, no.

00:10:59,728 --> 00:11:02,431
But if it was the Fatellis,
it's going to be clean.

00:11:02,498 --> 00:11:06,435
Yeah. Nick's truck has
no street value.

00:11:06,502 --> 00:11:08,937
The value was
what was inside.

00:11:22,284 --> 00:11:23,886
Did you get a number?

00:11:23,952 --> 00:11:27,289
No. No, I didn't get anything.

00:11:27,356 --> 00:11:28,924
She must have put it
in my pocket.

00:11:28,991 --> 00:11:30,326
Mindy.

00:11:31,393 --> 00:11:33,062
You think she'd know better

00:11:33,128 --> 00:11:35,798
than to wear white
on the bride's big day.

00:11:40,169 --> 00:11:43,138
STOKES:
<i>The perfume of American</i>
<i>beauties was everywhere.</i>

00:11:43,205 --> 00:11:45,674
<i>Though a rose</i>
<i>by any other name</i>

00:11:45,741 --> 00:11:47,076
<i>would have smelled</i>
<i>just as sweet</i>

00:11:47,142 --> 00:11:50,079
<i>on a day with that much love</i>
<i>in the air.</i>

00:12:03,492 --> 00:12:05,027
Ladies, hi,
how you doing?

00:12:05,094 --> 00:12:06,328
Hi.
Hi.

00:12:06,395 --> 00:12:08,263
I'm with the crime lab.
My name's Nick Stokes.

00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,666
I'm going to need to print
you both, okay?

00:12:10,733 --> 00:12:14,970
Mindy Faberge.
Bride's side.

00:12:15,037 --> 00:12:16,538
Um, can we go
in and change.

00:12:16,605 --> 00:12:19,308
I can't get warm.

00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:21,844
Cindy Jansen. I think
she's still in shock.

00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,679
You were in the wedding party.

00:12:23,746 --> 00:12:26,949
Did you spend most of the day
here with Ms. Chase?

00:12:27,016 --> 00:12:29,284
She was on her
best behavior.

00:12:29,351 --> 00:12:31,220
Outside that toast
she gave.

00:12:31,286 --> 00:12:33,322
There you go.
Thank you.

00:12:33,389 --> 00:12:36,659
Um, well, I think that
was the alcohol talking.

00:12:36,725 --> 00:12:39,361
So, she was a drinker?

00:12:39,428 --> 00:12:40,629
By the end
of the toast,

00:12:40,696 --> 00:12:41,697
she was
slurring her words

00:12:41,764 --> 00:12:45,067
and swaying all over the place.

00:12:45,134 --> 00:12:49,538
I almost felt bad for her.

00:12:49,605 --> 00:12:53,075
Anyone interested
in the wedding DVD?

00:12:53,142 --> 00:12:54,209
Yeah.

00:13:05,387 --> 00:13:07,823
All right, where
do you want to start?

00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:09,024
ALL:
The toast.

00:13:13,896 --> 00:13:16,465
Everyone...

00:13:16,532 --> 00:13:18,067
Everyone.

00:13:18,133 --> 00:13:20,536
I want to thank your for coming.

00:13:20,602 --> 00:13:23,238
You know, the Bible says,

00:13:23,305 --> 00:13:26,742
"Love is strong as death,"

00:13:26,809 --> 00:13:31,246
and as mother of the groom,
a wedding is bittersweet.

00:13:31,313 --> 00:13:35,851
You are giving up as much
as you are gaining.

00:13:35,918 --> 00:13:45,160
In some cases you are giving...
Oh... up much more.

00:13:49,765 --> 00:13:51,633
To hell with it.

00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,602
I'll wing it.

00:13:56,839 --> 00:13:58,707
My Adam...

00:13:58,774 --> 00:14:01,043
He studied at Oxford.

00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:04,647
He went to Harvard School
of Business.

00:14:04,713 --> 00:14:07,483
And of all the intelligent,

00:14:07,549 --> 00:14:12,321
wonderful, beautiful women
he met along the way,

00:14:12,388 --> 00:14:15,758
he ended up with Jill.

00:14:15,824 --> 00:14:19,762
Plain, little Jill.

00:14:22,031 --> 00:14:24,266
There's nothing wrong with her.

00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:26,769
But what's right with her?

00:14:26,835 --> 00:14:28,370
I mean,
even her name is boring.

00:14:28,437 --> 00:14:30,339
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:14:30,406 --> 00:14:35,778
Adam, it's all right
to take a lover.

00:14:35,844 --> 00:14:40,149
You just don't have to end up
marrying her.

00:14:40,215 --> 00:14:43,585
I mean, do you really want
to shallow

00:14:43,652 --> 00:14:45,921
our gene pool like this?

00:14:45,988 --> 00:14:47,489
Oh...

00:14:47,556 --> 00:14:51,460
Oh, I want to thank you all
so much for coming.

00:14:51,527 --> 00:14:53,929
Oh, I love you, Adam.

00:14:53,996 --> 00:14:56,198
MAN:
Hey, hey, good comedy, Diane...

00:14:56,265 --> 00:14:58,167
Justifiable homicide?

00:14:58,233 --> 00:15:00,703
( <i>video continues indistinctly)</i>

00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:04,500
Thank you all for coming.

00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:09,353
I love you, Adam.

00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,041
You talked to the bride.

00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:13,210
This seems like motive.

00:15:13,276 --> 00:15:14,978
Do you think
she did it?

00:15:15,045 --> 00:15:16,980
When would she have
had the time?

00:15:17,047 --> 00:15:19,416
You'd think she'd know better

00:15:19,483 --> 00:15:22,319
than to wear white
on the bride's big day.

00:15:26,089 --> 00:15:28,158
GRISSOM:
<i>Spring is but a song,</i>

00:15:28,225 --> 00:15:31,461
<i>where love and laughter</i>
<i>are not wrong.</i>

00:15:31,528 --> 00:15:34,131
<i>The blossoms of desire</i>
<i>do belong,</i>

00:15:34,197 --> 00:15:37,434
<i>and Harmonia axyridis</i>
<i>fly along.</i>

00:15:43,673 --> 00:15:46,143
JILL:
<i>For the past six months,</i>

00:15:46,209 --> 00:15:48,712
she made my life hell.

00:15:48,778 --> 00:15:51,047
And so I told anyone
who'd listen

00:15:51,114 --> 00:15:54,184
that she should die
a fiery death.

00:15:54,251 --> 00:15:57,521
So now everyone's going
to think that I killed her.

00:15:57,587 --> 00:15:59,189
Would you like to be
more specific?

00:15:59,256 --> 00:16:00,357
Okay, well,

00:16:00,423 --> 00:16:04,194
when we got engaged,
she ran into the backyard

00:16:04,261 --> 00:16:08,431
and she screamed,
"Why, God? Why me?"

00:16:08,498 --> 00:16:10,000
Okay, she wore white today.

00:16:10,066 --> 00:16:13,703
She invited Adam's
very, very attractive,

00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:18,508
very, um, single
ex-girlfriend.

00:16:18,575 --> 00:16:21,545
When she found out
that I had registered
for sporting goods,

00:16:21,611 --> 00:16:22,879
she went behind my back

00:16:22,946 --> 00:16:24,948
and she changed
the registry to housewares,

00:16:25,015 --> 00:16:27,617
saying that I'd better learn
how to cook, okay?

00:16:27,684 --> 00:16:29,786
I'm a vegetarian,

00:16:29,853 --> 00:16:31,955
and she demanded roast beef.

00:16:32,022 --> 00:16:35,425
Um... Oh, and then...
then there's the toast.

00:16:35,492 --> 00:16:37,594
The... the toast.

00:16:37,661 --> 00:16:40,764
Are you trying to make me think
that you didn't kill her?

00:16:40,831 --> 00:16:44,301
I would never do that to Adam.

00:16:44,367 --> 00:16:46,570
I honestly don't know how such

00:16:46,636 --> 00:16:51,775
an amazing man came
from-from... that.

00:16:51,842 --> 00:16:53,610
Look, it wasn't
just me, okay?

00:16:53,677 --> 00:16:56,613
She fought with everyone today.

00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:01,084
She fought with the valets
and the bridesmaids

00:17:01,151 --> 00:17:03,587
and the waiters.

00:17:03,653 --> 00:17:06,790
The caterer-- I thought for sure
he was going to poison her.

00:17:06,857 --> 00:17:07,958
Want to see a crime scene?

00:17:08,024 --> 00:17:10,160
I'll show you a crime scene.
Come here. Come here.

00:17:10,227 --> 00:17:11,394
Look at this, huh?

00:17:11,461 --> 00:17:13,497
What this woman had against
the color peach--

00:17:13,563 --> 00:17:15,065
I've never seen
anything like it.

00:17:15,132 --> 00:17:17,934
"If you think you're serving
that flesh-colored abomination,

00:17:18,001 --> 00:17:20,303
and I'm paying for it,
you can think again!" Boom!

00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:22,172
I'm a 42-year-old paisan.
She scared me.

00:17:22,239 --> 00:17:25,075
I wouldn't be surprised if her
pantyhose rebelled against her

00:17:25,142 --> 00:17:26,610
and tied themselves to the car.

00:17:26,676 --> 00:17:28,678
The dame was a pill.

00:17:28,745 --> 00:17:32,682
I swear to God, she may
have taken two or three
years off my own life.

00:17:32,749 --> 00:17:35,118
Weddings are a blood, sweat
and tears marathon, my friend.

00:17:35,185 --> 00:17:36,319
I'm on a tight schedule.

00:17:36,386 --> 00:17:38,355
12:00 noon, I got first intro
of the couple.

00:17:38,421 --> 00:17:39,356
12:30, salad course.

00:17:39,422 --> 00:17:41,191
12:45, first dance.

00:17:41,258 --> 00:17:43,193
1:00, chair dance, chicken
dance, broom dance--

00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,328
I don't care.
I'm equal opportunity.

00:17:45,395 --> 00:17:46,496
1:30, main course.

00:17:46,563 --> 00:17:48,265
2:15, first toast groom's side.

00:17:48,331 --> 00:17:51,635
If the best man
shuts his mouth,
at 2:16 we have

00:17:51,701 --> 00:17:53,069
the first toast
on the bride's side.

00:17:53,136 --> 00:17:55,205
3:00, we cut the cake.
3:30, bouquet toss.

00:17:55,272 --> 00:17:56,907
That's a tight schedule.

00:17:56,973 --> 00:17:59,342
She would have barely had time
to go to the bathroom.

00:17:59,409 --> 00:18:01,812
I don't sell bridal diapers
for nothing.

00:18:01,878 --> 00:18:04,781
He was kidding about
the diapers, right?

00:18:06,716 --> 00:18:09,986
You're way too pretty
to be a cop.

00:18:10,053 --> 00:18:13,957
I need to ask you about
your brother, Dino Fatelli.

00:18:14,024 --> 00:18:16,359
Dino always was
the bad seed.

00:18:16,426 --> 00:18:19,362
I heard you guys share
the taste for blood.

00:18:19,429 --> 00:18:21,498
I once was lost,

00:18:21,565 --> 00:18:25,068
but now I am found.

00:18:25,135 --> 00:18:26,703
You and your brother
keep in touch?

00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:28,472
Yeah, yeah.

00:18:28,538 --> 00:18:31,041
Last thing he said was he didn't
like the food at Lompoc.

00:18:31,107 --> 00:18:33,210
I told him
to call his lawyer.

00:18:33,276 --> 00:18:35,045
It's too late now.

00:18:35,111 --> 00:18:36,179
Where were you

00:18:36,246 --> 00:18:38,315
yesterday afternoon?

00:18:38,381 --> 00:18:40,217
You want to crawl up my ass?

00:18:40,283 --> 00:18:41,751
You can take a number.

00:18:41,818 --> 00:18:43,787
No thanks.

00:18:43,854 --> 00:18:46,022
50-to-one, Freddie the Feddy
is out there right now

00:18:46,089 --> 00:18:47,891
talking to you guys.

00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:49,960
UNDERSHERIFF:
Did you know
you were made?

00:18:50,026 --> 00:18:51,361
Yeah. Not even Diane Chase

00:18:51,428 --> 00:18:53,130
could keep
these guys out of jail.

00:18:53,196 --> 00:18:55,232
And we figure it's just
a matter of time

00:18:55,298 --> 00:18:57,067
before we get
something on Sylvano.

00:18:57,134 --> 00:19:00,403
Like another murder?

00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:02,539
Sorry.

00:19:02,606 --> 00:19:04,574
He didn't kill the lawyer.

00:19:04,641 --> 00:19:06,576
Runs numbers out
of his bar all day.

00:19:06,643 --> 00:19:08,278
Trying to pass
a kidney stone.

00:19:08,345 --> 00:19:10,247
Hates his wife
and his girlfriend.

00:19:10,313 --> 00:19:12,382
I hear everything.

00:19:12,449 --> 00:19:14,784
Could order one
of his guys to do it.

00:19:14,851 --> 00:19:16,987
The brothers like
to be hands-on.

00:19:17,053 --> 00:19:18,755
And all we're hearing
is them bitching

00:19:18,822 --> 00:19:21,491
about how somebody
snatched their M.O...

00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,362
ROBBINS:
Based on my dissection,

00:19:25,428 --> 00:19:27,931
I've detected
two separate events.

00:19:27,998 --> 00:19:29,399
I believe that
this puncture wound

00:19:29,466 --> 00:19:31,101
happened first.

00:19:31,168 --> 00:19:33,737
<i>The object lacerated</i>
<i>a cerebral artery</i>

00:19:33,804 --> 00:19:35,772
<i>creating a subdural hematoma.</i>

00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:38,408
<i>Then subsequent blows</i>
<i>to her skull,</i>

00:19:38,475 --> 00:19:40,977
from a ride behind the car,
created additional fractures

00:19:41,044 --> 00:19:43,146
which caused diffuse bleeding
on the brain,

00:19:43,213 --> 00:19:44,614
resulting in her death.

00:19:44,681 --> 00:19:46,149
So punctured and bobbled?

00:19:46,216 --> 00:19:47,284
Yeah.

00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:49,519
I autopsied the Fatellis'
original victim.

00:19:49,586 --> 00:19:50,720
They're sadists.

00:19:50,787 --> 00:19:52,656
First Remy James is dragged

00:19:52,722 --> 00:19:55,058
behind the Cadillac,
and when he wouldn't talk,

00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:56,660
they shot him
in every joint.

00:19:56,726 --> 00:19:58,662
And when he still
wouldn't talk,

00:19:58,728 --> 00:20:01,331
they finished him off
with a shot to the head.

00:20:01,398 --> 00:20:04,768
The Fatellis don't mostly
kill someone.

00:20:04,835 --> 00:20:06,937
So you took the perimeter
of the scene, right?

00:20:07,003 --> 00:20:08,305
Yeah.

00:20:08,371 --> 00:20:10,407
Well, I saw this guy
in the shadows.

00:20:10,474 --> 00:20:11,808
Archie blew it up.

00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:14,511
He looks more like
a suspect than a guest.

00:20:14,578 --> 00:20:17,147
That face look familiar?

00:20:19,082 --> 00:20:21,251
Oh, yeah.

00:20:21,318 --> 00:20:24,221
Yeah, I caught that guy trying
to sleep one off in the bushes.

00:20:24,287 --> 00:20:26,022
That's the groom's old man.

00:20:26,089 --> 00:20:30,193
Wow, I thought my wedding
was bad.

00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,695
Where is he?

00:20:31,761 --> 00:20:34,498
I sent him
to detox, in the tank.

00:20:34,564 --> 00:20:38,468
BRASS:
See, that's the problem
with being a deadbeat dad.

00:20:38,535 --> 00:20:40,070
If you're not around
for the bad times,

00:20:40,137 --> 00:20:41,872
they don't want you around
for the good times.

00:20:41,938 --> 00:20:43,440
I didn't... I'm not...

00:20:43,507 --> 00:20:45,509
Let's just cut right through

00:20:45,575 --> 00:20:47,944
the lie-and-deny part
of the chat,

00:20:48,011 --> 00:20:50,113
and I'll tell you
what I know.

00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:52,782
My mother was a powerful woman;
she had a lot of enemies.

00:20:52,849 --> 00:20:54,851
My mother and Joe
worked so hard

00:20:54,918 --> 00:20:56,553
to make this day perfect.

00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,421
It seems silly now.

00:20:58,488 --> 00:21:00,524
They had a fight
about the gifts, then...

00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:03,193
then there was a disagreement
with the bridesmaids.

00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,896
And my mother accidentally
brought the wrong dress.

00:21:05,962 --> 00:21:09,966
Then the dinner was wrong,
and the cake was wrong.

00:21:10,033 --> 00:21:12,469
And my father showed up.

00:21:12,536 --> 00:21:14,404
What, he wasn't invited?

00:21:14,471 --> 00:21:15,806
Um, no.

00:21:15,872 --> 00:21:17,407
My parents are divorced.

00:21:17,474 --> 00:21:19,709
I think that's why today
was so hard on her.

00:21:19,776 --> 00:21:22,913
The wedding brought up
a lot of issues for her.

00:21:22,979 --> 00:21:25,916
She sacrificed
so much for me.

00:21:25,982 --> 00:21:27,450
Single parent, grad school.

00:21:27,517 --> 00:21:28,785
She was a champion.

00:21:30,787 --> 00:21:34,291
My father is... unstable.

00:21:34,357 --> 00:21:36,893
For years, he's had
a drug problem.

00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,395
FATHER:
<i>She told him that.</i>

00:21:38,462 --> 00:21:40,831
I don't believe that bitch!

00:21:40,897 --> 00:21:44,201
You do or you don't have
a drug problem? Which is it?

00:21:44,267 --> 00:21:46,603
Don't take everything you see
at face value.

00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:55,579
15 years ago, Diane decided
she wanted to go back to work.

00:21:55,645 --> 00:21:59,082
And I encouraged her.

00:21:59,149 --> 00:22:04,020
But then she became... driven.

00:22:04,087 --> 00:22:06,089
And I was slowing her down.

00:22:06,156 --> 00:22:07,591
She got nasty.

00:22:07,657 --> 00:22:09,559
I got depressed.

00:22:09,626 --> 00:22:12,596
I started taking
antidepressants.

00:22:12,662 --> 00:22:14,231
She was mortified.

00:22:14,297 --> 00:22:15,932
Said it wouldn't look good.

00:22:15,999 --> 00:22:17,601
I said, "Hey,
I'm not one of your clients.

00:22:17,667 --> 00:22:19,836
I'm your husband."

00:22:19,903 --> 00:22:22,038
"Not anymore," she said.

00:22:22,105 --> 00:22:24,074
She filed

00:22:24,141 --> 00:22:25,675
for divorce.

00:22:25,742 --> 00:22:30,280
And she said it was because
the drugs affected my libido.

00:22:30,347 --> 00:22:32,115
We hadn't had sex

00:22:32,182 --> 00:22:37,287
for eight months
before I started
taking the drugs.

00:22:37,354 --> 00:22:40,390
Did you have an altercation
with her at the wedding?

00:22:40,457 --> 00:22:43,026
Yeah. Yeah.

00:22:44,628 --> 00:22:47,664
Because of the meds,
I don't drink very much.

00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:52,636
I did today because
I thought it would
take the edge off.

00:22:54,304 --> 00:22:56,273
It put the edge on.

00:22:58,675 --> 00:23:00,343
Good to see you.

00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:02,946
Hi. How are you?
It's great...

00:23:03,013 --> 00:23:04,514
Excuse me.

00:23:07,317 --> 00:23:09,386
You were not invited.

00:23:09,452 --> 00:23:11,288
I read the papers, Diane.

00:23:11,354 --> 00:23:13,356
They teach literacy
at the halfway house?

00:23:13,423 --> 00:23:15,125
I didn't
come here to fight.

00:23:15,192 --> 00:23:16,927
You're not here at all.

00:23:16,993 --> 00:23:18,361
He's my son, too.

00:23:18,428 --> 00:23:20,864
I wouldn't be
so sure of that.

00:23:20,931 --> 00:23:24,067
I stuck around
to see the ceremony.

00:23:24,134 --> 00:23:26,536
I even saw a little bit
of the reception.

00:23:26,603 --> 00:23:29,940
I was sleeping it off
when your guys found me.

00:23:30,006 --> 00:23:31,441
So you didn't kill her?

00:23:31,508 --> 00:23:35,712
No. But you better check
to see if she's really dead,

00:23:35,779 --> 00:23:37,147
because I don't think

00:23:37,214 --> 00:23:39,182
you can kill the devil.

00:23:41,418 --> 00:23:43,320
Nick, you drew Mr. Chase's blood
at the scene.

00:23:43,386 --> 00:23:44,988
His BAC was .28.

00:23:45,055 --> 00:23:46,256
That was at 4:00 p.m.

00:23:46,323 --> 00:23:48,225
And officers drew it
again at the station

00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:50,327
an hour later. It was .22.

00:23:50,393 --> 00:23:52,429
So he was in
the elimination phase.

00:23:52,496 --> 00:23:54,231
That means, when the victim
was tied to the car,

00:23:54,297 --> 00:23:56,800
his blood alcohol level
was even higher.

00:23:56,867 --> 00:23:58,768
Mr. Chase was blotto.

00:23:58,835 --> 00:24:00,237
He couldn't have
tied his own shoes.

00:24:00,303 --> 00:24:03,840
Assuming whoever took your
truck is the killer,

00:24:03,907 --> 00:24:05,876
Mr. Chase was in the tank.
He couldn't have done it.

00:24:05,942 --> 00:24:07,911
One suspect down.

00:24:07,978 --> 00:24:09,312
Speaking of downers,

00:24:09,379 --> 00:24:12,048
Ms. Chase liked her diazepam.

00:24:12,115 --> 00:24:15,218
Blood levels were somewhere
between therapeutic and toxic.

00:24:15,285 --> 00:24:17,721
That's... that's weird.
Her ex-husband told Brass

00:24:17,787 --> 00:24:21,024
she was very
anti-psychopharmaceuticals.

00:24:21,091 --> 00:24:22,092
As a toxicology tech,

00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,694
I'd say often those who
adamantly oppose the D-train

00:24:24,761 --> 00:24:26,396
are its most frequent
passengers.

00:24:26,463 --> 00:24:28,365
But, since she
is deceased,

00:24:28,431 --> 00:24:29,699
I was able to get
her medical records.

00:24:29,766 --> 00:24:32,402
No diazepam scrip.

00:24:32,469 --> 00:24:35,338
So she got daffy
on someone else's pills.

00:24:35,405 --> 00:24:38,008
That explains Mindy's
account of her behavior.

00:24:38,074 --> 00:24:39,910
And the toast.

00:24:39,976 --> 00:24:43,380
Doesn't explain how she was
conked out, tied to a bumper.

00:24:44,815 --> 00:24:46,416
I might know what happened.

00:24:46,483 --> 00:24:48,451
You'd think she'd know better
than to wear white

00:24:48,518 --> 00:24:50,320
on the bride's big day.

00:24:52,989 --> 00:24:54,558
SANDERS:
<i>A dame was dead,</i>

00:24:54,624 --> 00:24:56,459
<i>but enough about her.</i>

00:24:56,526 --> 00:24:58,662
<i>The air was hot and heavy</i>
<i>with wrong,</i>

00:24:58,728 --> 00:25:00,864
<i>making me thirsty.</i>

00:25:00,931 --> 00:25:02,666
<i>Thirsty for a tall drink</i>
<i>of water.</i>

00:25:02,732 --> 00:25:05,101
<i>That's when I saw her--</i>
<i>a flower--</i>

00:25:05,168 --> 00:25:07,237
<i>but not the kind</i>
<i>you pin on a lapel.</i>

00:25:07,304 --> 00:25:09,206
<i>She was long-stemmed.</i>

00:25:09,272 --> 00:25:12,142
SIDLE:
<i>All right, Raymond Chandler,</i>
<i>we get it.</i>

00:25:16,112 --> 00:25:18,482
SANDERS:
<i>And those weren't</i>
<i>just Miracle Bras.</i>

00:25:18,548 --> 00:25:20,650
<i>They were creating</i>
<i>four Wonders of the World.</i>

00:25:20,717 --> 00:25:23,153
I'm Greg Sanders,
with the crime lab.

00:25:24,621 --> 00:25:26,323
I need to
take your prints.

00:25:27,958 --> 00:25:30,026
That's quite a case
you got there.

00:25:30,093 --> 00:25:31,228
Is that your
magic kit?

00:25:31,294 --> 00:25:32,629
Or your toy box?

00:25:32,696 --> 00:25:35,899
You don't seem to be very upset
about what happened.

00:25:35,966 --> 00:25:37,467
Sweetheart, I've had
so many martinis,

00:25:37,534 --> 00:25:39,069
I'm both shaken
<i>and</i> stirred.

00:25:39,136 --> 00:25:40,604
Numbing the pain?

00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:41,404
Look, we're not
going to pretend

00:25:41,471 --> 00:25:43,006
to be all liquid
and soft, okay?

00:25:43,073 --> 00:25:44,641
All that's
missing here

00:25:44,708 --> 00:25:45,675
are the striped socks.

00:25:45,742 --> 00:25:46,843
Ding, dong,
the witch is dead.

00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:48,345
So you're not a fan?

00:25:48,411 --> 00:25:50,814
Cruella made me
wear underwear today.

00:25:50,881 --> 00:25:52,782
No one makes me
wear underwear.

00:25:52,849 --> 00:25:55,318
I'll do you
if you do me.

00:25:57,754 --> 00:25:59,956
SIDLE:
<i>They did not.</i>

00:26:00,023 --> 00:26:03,460
So how does that help
explain how Diane Chase died?

00:26:03,527 --> 00:26:04,795
I'm getting there.

00:26:04,861 --> 00:26:07,097
Okay, ladies,
let's slow it down.

00:26:07,164 --> 00:26:08,632
When was

00:26:08,698 --> 00:26:10,200
the last time you saw Diane?

00:26:10,267 --> 00:26:11,468
In the hospitality suite.

00:26:11,535 --> 00:26:13,036
I came in to fix my hair.

00:26:13,103 --> 00:26:14,538
She was complaining
of a headache.

00:26:14,604 --> 00:26:17,707
Next time I saw her, it was
bottoms up, Mommie Dearest.

00:26:22,412 --> 00:26:24,548
<i>So I headed behind</i>
<i>the pink curtain,</i>

00:26:24,614 --> 00:26:26,616
<i>where the girls go</i>
<i>to get glossy.</i>

00:26:43,233 --> 00:26:46,970
<i>A little shine here,</i>
<i>a little pouf there.</i>

00:26:47,037 --> 00:26:48,572
<i>A little...</i>

00:26:48,638 --> 00:26:52,042
<i>Well, I don't exactly</i>
<i>know what that was,</i>

00:26:52,108 --> 00:26:54,110
<i>but I liked the feel.</i>

00:26:58,582 --> 00:27:01,751
<i>Marriage was looking</i>
<i>like a lucrative endeavor.</i>

00:27:08,091 --> 00:27:09,593
<i>And that's when I saw it.</i>

00:27:13,597 --> 00:27:15,532
<i>Just a few drops.</i>

00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:19,503
<i>I thought the blood</i>
<i>could have been incidental--</i>

00:27:19,569 --> 00:27:21,571
<i>nosebleed, shaving accident.</i>

00:27:29,579 --> 00:27:32,782
<i>But, what if, high as a kite</i>
<i>on a slipped Mickey,</i>

00:27:32,849 --> 00:27:37,587
she slips-- and bam!-- straight
to the back of the skull?

00:27:37,654 --> 00:27:39,589
The arrow

00:27:39,656 --> 00:27:40,824
was four-sided.

00:27:40,891 --> 00:27:44,127
It would leave
a diamond-shaped wound.

00:27:44,194 --> 00:27:46,696
They match.

00:27:46,763 --> 00:27:49,366
If the initial wound

00:27:49,432 --> 00:27:51,368
was accidental,

00:27:51,434 --> 00:27:53,570
why was she panty-hosed
to the back of a car?

00:27:53,637 --> 00:27:54,571
Don't know yet.

00:27:54,638 --> 00:27:55,972
Narrows the field

00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:58,508
of suspects down to someone
who had access to that suite.

00:27:58,575 --> 00:28:00,243
Where's the statue?

00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:01,812
In your car.

00:28:01,878 --> 00:28:03,313
Ah!

00:28:10,542 --> 00:28:12,644
I know every piece
of evidence regarding

00:28:12,711 --> 00:28:14,667
this case is precious,
given the circumstances,

00:28:14,667 --> 00:28:15,968
so I just wanted to let you know

00:28:16,035 --> 00:28:18,504
that I've moved Ms. Chase's
fingernail scrapings

00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:20,873
to the top of my
extensive queue.

00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:24,010
Composite substance.
You're never going
to believe this.

00:28:24,076 --> 00:28:27,480
Egg whites, sugar, butter, milk,
food coloring.

00:28:27,546 --> 00:28:28,881
How did you know?

00:28:28,948 --> 00:28:30,216
Butter cream frosting.

00:28:30,282 --> 00:28:33,052
She had an incident
with a wedding cake.

00:28:36,989 --> 00:28:38,524
Are you done?

00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:42,094
You know, you and me,
we're not the marrying kind.

00:28:42,161 --> 00:28:44,030
The intricacies of our nature

00:28:44,096 --> 00:28:46,198
can never be understood
by just one woman.

00:28:46,265 --> 00:28:49,201
Would you close the door,
please?

00:28:56,142 --> 00:28:58,077
From the other side.

00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:11,123
Sara? Sara?

00:29:12,124 --> 00:29:13,559
Are they here?

00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:16,028
No. They're still held up with
that officer-involved shooting,

00:29:16,095 --> 00:29:18,898
but the Bomb Squad
has cleared the convertible.

00:29:18,964 --> 00:29:20,433
Oh. Finally.

00:29:20,499 --> 00:29:22,168
<i>Something to process.</i>

00:29:25,971 --> 00:29:28,074
I thought you said
the snowboards were
in the suite.

00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,343
I did.

00:29:30,409 --> 00:29:32,345
Then what's the case
doing in the trunk?

00:29:47,793 --> 00:29:50,062
So you asked me to follow
her comings and goings

00:29:50,129 --> 00:29:51,564
and her food and drink intake.

00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:52,765
As far as I can tell,

00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:55,768
she didn't touch her soup
or salad.

00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:57,503
And the main course?

00:30:04,043 --> 00:30:06,112
And what did Diane
have to drink?

00:30:06,178 --> 00:30:09,148
Um... I only saw her
with two glasses,

00:30:09,215 --> 00:30:12,051
both champagne,
first one around 2:00.

00:30:12,118 --> 00:30:15,755
But maybe she was hitting
the bar, because look:

00:30:15,821 --> 00:30:19,425
This is 15 minutes later.

00:30:19,492 --> 00:30:20,659
Oh, my.

00:30:20,726 --> 00:30:23,496
The waiter gave her a second
glass for her toast,

00:30:23,562 --> 00:30:25,631
which I watched five times.

00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:28,267
And that was it.

00:30:28,334 --> 00:30:30,936
When was the last time
she was on camera?

00:30:31,003 --> 00:30:36,275
Well, her exit was neither
polite nor discreet.

00:30:36,342 --> 00:30:40,413
I know I may just be a grease
monkey, but I drive a tow truck,

00:30:40,479 --> 00:30:43,883
and I think I know a little
something about getting hitched.

00:30:43,949 --> 00:30:46,519
And these two... uh...
there's more.

00:30:46,585 --> 00:30:51,590
Uh... I think these guys
are in it for the long haul.

00:30:51,657 --> 00:30:53,659
Making friends over here.

00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:56,162
No, but seriously,
uh...

00:30:56,228 --> 00:30:57,997
I don't mean to get
all sentimental
or anything,

00:30:58,064 --> 00:30:59,865
but these two
are going to have
a lot of sex tonight.

00:30:59,932 --> 00:31:01,667
And.. what?

00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:03,536
What? Are you embarrassed?

00:31:03,602 --> 00:31:05,404
She's embarrassed.
I'm her older brother.

00:31:05,471 --> 00:31:06,439
I changed her diapers.

00:31:06,505 --> 00:31:08,741
That was 2:25.

00:31:08,808 --> 00:31:10,476
Would you
play that again?

00:31:13,012 --> 00:31:14,847
I know I may just be

00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:17,683
a grease monkey,
but I drive a tow truck,

00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:20,119
<i>and I think I know</i>
<i>a little something</i>

00:31:20,186 --> 00:31:21,687
<i>about getting hitched.</i>

00:31:25,958 --> 00:31:28,160
Yeah, Jim. Check into
a Mikey Shoemaker,

00:31:28,227 --> 00:31:29,462
the bride's brother.

00:31:29,528 --> 00:31:31,130
Run his wants and warrants.

00:31:31,197 --> 00:31:33,399
And also look into the location
of his tow yard.

00:31:33,466 --> 00:31:34,734
Thank you.

00:31:43,976 --> 00:31:44,910
So?

00:31:44,977 --> 00:31:47,480
Need your hands.

00:31:47,546 --> 00:31:49,382
I thought
you'd never ask.

00:31:49,448 --> 00:31:50,950
I need you to
reprint the bumper

00:31:51,017 --> 00:31:52,585
because the tape lifts
were stolen.

00:31:52,651 --> 00:31:54,787
Anything to
keep me awake.

00:32:00,826 --> 00:32:04,930
Uh-oh! Looks like we had some
bride's little helper going on.

00:32:04,997 --> 00:32:06,499
Diazepam.

00:32:06,565 --> 00:32:08,434
Just filled. Rx calls

00:32:08,501 --> 00:32:11,337
for six
ten-milligram pills.

00:32:11,404 --> 00:32:13,105
Two left.

00:32:13,172 --> 00:32:15,274
40 milligrams would match
mom's blood level.

00:32:15,341 --> 00:32:18,577
Jill gets some pills
to calm herself,

00:32:18,644 --> 00:32:20,946
decides to calm
her mother-in-law instead,

00:32:21,013 --> 00:32:23,015
and make everybody happy.

00:32:23,082 --> 00:32:25,151
Okay, the blood
from the snowboard bag

00:32:25,217 --> 00:32:26,452
was a match
to Mother Chase.

00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:29,855
That could have been
what they used
to transport her

00:32:29,922 --> 00:32:31,190
from point A to point B.

00:32:31,257 --> 00:32:32,992
Yeah, "they" is right,
'cause I also found

00:32:33,059 --> 00:32:34,560
two female
epithelial contributions.

00:32:34,627 --> 00:32:36,095
One on each handle
of the bag,

00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:37,296
and then one
of the same females

00:32:37,363 --> 00:32:38,464
was also a match
to the DNA

00:32:38,531 --> 00:32:40,766
from the knot
in the pantyhose.

00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:43,035
We could compare them
to the buccal swabs

00:32:43,102 --> 00:32:45,071
we collected...
if we still had them.

00:32:45,137 --> 00:32:47,306
Well, we'll just have
to recollect them.

00:32:47,373 --> 00:32:48,407
All 200 of them?

00:32:48,474 --> 00:32:50,576
Yeah, and since we can't leave,

00:32:50,643 --> 00:32:53,079
someone else is gonna have
to recollect them.

00:32:53,145 --> 00:32:54,447
This is crap!

00:32:54,513 --> 00:32:56,649
I've been waiting on I.A.B.
for...( <i>snaps gloves</i> )

00:32:56,716 --> 00:32:57,717
...14 hours.

00:32:57,783 --> 00:32:59,518
I'm tired...

00:32:59,585 --> 00:33:01,654
and I kind of smell,

00:33:01,721 --> 00:33:03,956
and I don't have a freakin' car.

00:33:08,094 --> 00:33:09,362
Hey, buddy.

00:33:09,428 --> 00:33:11,564
Hey.

00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:12,565
How you doing?

00:33:12,631 --> 00:33:13,833
You all right?

00:33:13,899 --> 00:33:14,967
Hey, this,
this sucks, man.

00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:16,202
I didn't do anything wrong,

00:33:16,268 --> 00:33:18,437
and everybody's looking
at me like I'm the bad guy.

00:33:18,504 --> 00:33:19,505
If I had to do it
all over again,

00:33:19,572 --> 00:33:20,439
I'd do the exact
same thing.

00:33:20,506 --> 00:33:21,507
Nick, Nick...

00:33:21,574 --> 00:33:23,209
I mean, how do I fix
the situation?

00:33:23,275 --> 00:33:24,410
Nick!

00:33:24,477 --> 00:33:26,112
It was already screwed up
to begin with. What?

00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,636
I loaned one of
the bridesmaids my jacket.

00:33:37,702 --> 00:33:40,172
She was wearing black.

00:33:40,238 --> 00:33:42,707
There was no reason
to ALS.

00:33:42,774 --> 00:33:46,912
Blood must have transferred
from her

00:33:46,978 --> 00:33:49,514
to my jacket, to me.

00:33:49,581 --> 00:33:50,515
I didn't want to contaminate it

00:33:50,582 --> 00:33:51,850
by pulling it over my head,
you know?

00:33:51,917 --> 00:33:53,185
That was good thinking.

00:33:59,191 --> 00:34:01,193
All right.
Hey, Wendy,
Uh-huh?

00:34:01,259 --> 00:34:02,427
I don't know
if you'll be able

00:34:02,494 --> 00:34:03,595
to get anything off of this,

00:34:03,662 --> 00:34:06,131
but I want you to compare
the female epithelials you found

00:34:06,198 --> 00:34:09,234
on the snowboard bag
against the napkin that I have

00:34:09,301 --> 00:34:10,569
in my right front pocket.

00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:14,506
Come on.

00:34:22,647 --> 00:34:25,617
( <i>laughs</i> )

00:34:25,684 --> 00:34:28,754
So that was a good call
on the bride's brother,
Mikey Shoemaker.

00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:30,322
He had a prior conviction
for car theft.

00:34:30,388 --> 00:34:32,224
Where did you find
Nick's truck?

00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:34,860
In one of the paint bays
of his auto body shop,

00:34:34,926 --> 00:34:37,162
right next
to a delivery truck.

00:34:37,229 --> 00:34:38,563
We're looking
for Mikey now.

00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:40,532
Well, I watched
the rest of the
wedding video.

00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:42,567
He may have stolen
the car,

00:34:42,634 --> 00:34:46,171
but once Diane disappears,
Mikey never leaves the party.

00:34:46,238 --> 00:34:47,906
Maybe he wasn't
acting alone.

00:34:47,973 --> 00:34:50,709
Hey, Pip.
How you like
your new ride?

00:34:53,979 --> 00:34:55,981
Hey, look.
They fixed it.

00:34:56,047 --> 00:34:58,517
Oh. Oh, that's not funny.

00:34:58,583 --> 00:34:59,818
Oh, it's a little funny.

00:35:16,001 --> 00:35:18,570
Where did you get that?

00:35:18,637 --> 00:35:19,671
Unis found it
in a Dumpster

00:35:19,738 --> 00:35:21,373
behind Mikey Shoemaker's
body shop.

00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,707
He went through
all that trouble

00:35:22,774 --> 00:35:24,910
to steal the car
and that's where
he ditches it?

00:35:24,976 --> 00:35:27,813
Well, they didn't find
any biological evidence,

00:35:27,879 --> 00:35:29,414
and he probably hocked
the cameras,

00:35:29,481 --> 00:35:31,883
but at least I've been reunited
with Love's deadly arrow.

00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:35,053
You know that's not going
to stand up in court, right?

00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,322
Well, Negative Nelly,
I know that, and you know that,

00:35:37,389 --> 00:35:39,991
but the suspects might not.

00:35:40,058 --> 00:35:41,860
We have to convince them
that we know what happened.

00:35:41,927 --> 00:35:43,462
Do we?
We're close.

00:35:43,528 --> 00:35:45,497
Can you put the U.V.
filter on the camera?

00:35:45,564 --> 00:35:46,898
Sure.

00:36:01,213 --> 00:36:02,147
How did you...?

00:36:02,214 --> 00:36:03,348
I didn't,

00:36:03,415 --> 00:36:04,483
until I processed it.

00:36:04,549 --> 00:36:05,484
But I was thinking

00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:07,185
the statue
punctured her

00:36:07,252 --> 00:36:08,587
in the back of the head,
which means

00:36:08,653 --> 00:36:10,889
one of three things
might have happened.

00:36:10,956 --> 00:36:12,491
Either she was stabbed by it...

00:36:12,557 --> 00:36:14,259
Well, the statue looks
a little unwieldy.

00:36:14,326 --> 00:36:17,028
Or she accidentally
fell on it.

00:36:17,095 --> 00:36:18,764
But with no one to blame,

00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:20,599
why wouldn't someone
just call 911?

00:36:20,665 --> 00:36:24,136
Which leaves us with option
number three:

00:36:24,202 --> 00:36:25,771
she was pushed.

00:36:29,307 --> 00:36:32,010
Lucky for us someone had
something on their hands.

00:36:32,077 --> 00:36:33,912
Something that left
good ridge detail

00:36:33,979 --> 00:36:35,580
I'll swab it for trace.

00:36:35,647 --> 00:36:38,417
Prints are a match
to a bridesmaid, Lacey Finn.

00:36:38,483 --> 00:36:39,518
She's in the system?

00:36:39,584 --> 00:36:42,487
Yeah, she was a cocktail
waitress for a short time.

00:36:42,554 --> 00:36:43,722
Of course she was.

00:36:43,789 --> 00:36:46,091
And I pulled the prints off
of this pill bottle,

00:36:46,158 --> 00:36:47,292
but I didn't find a match.

00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:48,560
Which means the bride
didn't do it

00:36:48,627 --> 00:36:51,096
because as a nurse,
she'd also be in
the system.

00:36:51,163 --> 00:36:53,498
Correct. However,
I did find something.

00:36:53,565 --> 00:36:55,801
Look at the prescribing
doctor on that label.

00:36:55,867 --> 00:36:57,903
I was cross-checking
with the guest list,

00:36:57,969 --> 00:36:59,838
and guess who the good doctor's
wife is.

00:37:01,106 --> 00:37:02,474
Mrs. Valerie Whitehall.

00:37:02,541 --> 00:37:03,642
She's also a bridesmaid.

00:37:06,311 --> 00:37:08,079
Well, she knew
where the pills were.

00:37:08,146 --> 00:37:09,548
She had access
to the suite,

00:37:09,614 --> 00:37:13,718
so maybe Jill didn't
poison mom, Valerie did.

00:37:13,785 --> 00:37:15,821
A little bonus in the bubbly.

00:37:15,887 --> 00:37:18,323
I got the results
from Mama Chase's
suit jacket.

00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:19,624
What's the trace?

00:37:19,691 --> 00:37:21,259
Hair gel.

00:37:24,429 --> 00:37:27,532
Lacey said that she went
to fix her hair.

00:37:30,068 --> 00:37:31,603
Where's that Sara chick?

00:37:33,672 --> 00:37:35,073
Oh, Romeo,
I don't think

00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:36,575
that you have time
for romance.

00:37:36,641 --> 00:37:38,577
You're being charged
with grand theft auto,

00:37:38,643 --> 00:37:42,013
obstruction of justice
and conspiracy to murder.

00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:45,517
Okay, I will cop
to everything but the murder.

00:37:45,584 --> 00:37:47,285
Well, if you didn't
commit the murder,

00:37:47,352 --> 00:37:48,787
why did you steal
the car?

00:37:48,854 --> 00:37:51,957
Look, the lady
was already dead, all right?

00:37:52,023 --> 00:37:54,025
And then, then
you guys show up

00:37:54,092 --> 00:37:55,427
and this bridesmaid
comes up to me

00:37:55,494 --> 00:37:57,763
and starts asking
me all these questions
about my tow truck.

00:37:57,829 --> 00:37:58,764
Which bridesmaid?

00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:00,332
The hot one.

00:38:00,398 --> 00:38:02,868
Next thing I know,
she wants to be the Bonnie

00:38:02,934 --> 00:38:04,035
to my Clyde.

00:38:04,102 --> 00:38:06,872
Asked me to steal this car
and trash all the evidence.

00:38:06,938 --> 00:38:10,008
So you committed grand theft
auto to get laid?

00:38:11,777 --> 00:38:14,312
Ever stolen a two-ton piece
of machinery?

00:38:14,379 --> 00:38:17,949
It is way
better than sex.

00:38:18,016 --> 00:38:19,317
And finding a girl
that doesn't want to kick you

00:38:19,384 --> 00:38:20,352
to the curb for it?

00:38:20,419 --> 00:38:22,154
I mean, come on.
That is just hot.

00:38:23,422 --> 00:38:24,356
Besides,

00:38:24,423 --> 00:38:25,390
I hadn't gotten
a wedding gift

00:38:25,457 --> 00:38:26,858
for my sister yet.

00:38:26,925 --> 00:38:27,993
So I don't have
a match

00:38:28,059 --> 00:38:29,795
to one of the handles
to the snowboard case,

00:38:29,861 --> 00:38:31,830
but, um,
your napkin girl...

00:38:31,897 --> 00:38:33,565
That Mindy Faberge?

00:38:33,632 --> 00:38:35,934
She got to be
a bridesmaid.
Yeah.

00:38:36,001 --> 00:38:37,903
She matches
the other handle.

00:38:37,969 --> 00:38:40,906
Well, she was in the suite
with the gifts.

00:38:40,972 --> 00:38:42,374
She could have touched
it then.

00:38:44,476 --> 00:38:46,011
You paged?

00:38:46,077 --> 00:38:48,413
We think that each
of the bridesmaids

00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,915
is responsible for killing her.

00:38:49,981 --> 00:38:53,718
Not individually,
but working in cahoots.

00:38:53,785 --> 00:38:56,054
Each one played
their part.

00:38:56,121 --> 00:38:58,657
Did you know the original role
of the bridesmaid

00:38:58,723 --> 00:39:02,260
was to act as a human shield
against the bride's enemies?

00:39:02,327 --> 00:39:04,162
Women would dress

00:39:04,229 --> 00:39:06,198
similar to the bride
in an effort to confuse

00:39:06,264 --> 00:39:07,432
and outsmart evil spirits

00:39:07,499 --> 00:39:09,935
that might try to overtake her
on her wedding day.

00:39:10,001 --> 00:39:11,403
Wow, for somebody
who's anti-wedding,

00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:14,406
you certainly know
a lot about it.

00:39:14,473 --> 00:39:15,707
I'm not anti-wedding.

00:39:15,774 --> 00:39:16,975
I'm just anti-stupid--

00:39:17,042 --> 00:39:19,578
you know, people who do things
for the sake of tradition

00:39:19,644 --> 00:39:20,712
with no clue as to why.

00:39:20,779 --> 00:39:25,984
Anyway, let's start
at the beginning, shall we?

00:39:27,285 --> 00:39:30,756
Valerie kindly gets
mom a drink.

00:39:38,063 --> 00:39:42,300
Then during her toast, Diane
starts to feel the effects.

00:39:42,367 --> 00:39:43,635
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:49,307
By Mikey's toast, she decides
that she's toast.

00:39:49,374 --> 00:39:51,643
...a little something
about getting hitched.

00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:55,147
I know what you did.

00:39:55,213 --> 00:40:00,018
I'm going to have
your husband's medical license,

00:40:00,085 --> 00:40:03,522
and I'm going
to have you put away
for attempted murder.

00:40:03,588 --> 00:40:06,491
SANDERS:
<i>Lacey overhears</i>
<i>Diane's paranoid</i>

00:40:06,558 --> 00:40:11,997
yet correct ramblings
and eventually follows her out.

00:40:16,935 --> 00:40:18,136
You okay?

00:40:18,203 --> 00:40:19,771
The gall of you
to ask me that!

00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:21,807
You know I'm not okay,
you little tart.

00:40:21,873 --> 00:40:23,742
You're all just
as bad as she is.

00:40:23,809 --> 00:40:24,743
Don't get mad.

00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:26,445
Valerie was just trying
to make you feel better.

00:40:26,511 --> 00:40:30,148
Oh, by giving me
a controlled substance?

00:40:30,215 --> 00:40:35,087
You are going down
for conspiracy!

00:40:35,153 --> 00:40:36,121
All right!

00:40:36,188 --> 00:40:37,355
You know what, lady?!

00:40:37,422 --> 00:40:40,158
That's enough!

00:40:40,225 --> 00:40:44,896
SANDERS:
<i>Leaving her incapacitated</i>
<i>but not dead.</i>

00:40:47,032 --> 00:40:49,367
STOKES:
At which point Lacey

00:40:49,434 --> 00:40:52,437
<i>tells Mindy and Cindy.</i>

00:40:52,504 --> 00:40:54,539
<i>They formulate a plan.</i>

00:40:54,606 --> 00:40:56,341
( <i>flesh tearing</i> )

00:40:56,408 --> 00:40:57,709
Oh, God!
Once we get her
in there,

00:40:57,776 --> 00:40:58,977
what are we going
to do with her?

00:40:59,044 --> 00:41:02,614
Oh, um, let's make it look
like it was, um, Forelli...

00:41:02,681 --> 00:41:04,249
Fratelli brothers?

00:41:04,316 --> 00:41:05,717
Fratelli brothers.

00:41:05,784 --> 00:41:08,153
We'll just make it
look like they did it.

00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,221
Oh, my God.

00:41:15,193 --> 00:41:19,064
They tie her to the car,
chuck the bag in the trunk,

00:41:19,131 --> 00:41:20,465
return to the party.

00:41:20,532 --> 00:41:21,967
( <i>all clamoring</i> )

00:41:27,072 --> 00:41:28,340
Got it, yes!

00:41:29,474 --> 00:41:31,743
SIDLE:
And everyone

00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:33,078
just continues along

00:41:33,145 --> 00:41:35,881
with the joyous
festivities until...

00:41:35,947 --> 00:41:38,283
( <i>cheering</i> )

00:41:42,888 --> 00:41:45,090
I'm not a bad person,

00:41:45,157 --> 00:41:48,493
and we didn't exactly kill her.

00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,396
I mean, I like to think
she killed herself

00:41:51,463 --> 00:41:53,598
because she was crazy.

00:41:53,665 --> 00:41:56,368
She did crazy things
to our friend.

00:41:56,435 --> 00:41:59,704
I mean, who hates
a pediatric nurse?

00:41:59,771 --> 00:42:04,943
Granted, we'd all been drinking,
but she drove us to it.

00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:07,045
We did what we had to do.

00:42:07,112 --> 00:42:10,382
Sisterhood is powerful
this and powerful that.

00:42:10,449 --> 00:42:12,084
She was on a total trip.

00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:15,987
There was no way Jill could
endure a life of that.

00:42:16,054 --> 00:42:18,623
I just... I wanted to shut her
up with the drugs,

00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:22,060
but that backfired...

00:42:22,127 --> 00:42:23,128
leaving us...

00:42:23,195 --> 00:42:24,129
<i>...no choice.</i>

00:42:24,196 --> 00:42:25,197
She was coming at me.

00:42:25,263 --> 00:42:28,100
I just, I just defended myself.

00:42:28,166 --> 00:42:33,338
I didn't mean to take her down,
but once she was, I...

00:42:33,405 --> 00:42:35,841
I felt nothing.

00:42:35,907 --> 00:42:39,211
There she was just,
just staring at me,

00:42:39,277 --> 00:42:41,913
and all I could think
was...

00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:44,516
"Thank God."

00:42:55,694 --> 00:42:57,629
Grissom?

00:42:59,631 --> 00:43:01,933
I.A.B. is here.

00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,002
Lovely.

00:43:04,069 --> 00:43:06,171
You should know that while
waiting for I.A.B.,

00:43:06,238 --> 00:43:08,106
we recovered the car
and solved the case.

00:43:08,173 --> 00:43:11,209
UNDERSHERIFF:
Well, this is not

00:43:11,276 --> 00:43:12,978
a "No harm, no foul"
situation.

00:43:13,044 --> 00:43:15,647
Disciplinary action
may still be taken.

00:43:15,714 --> 00:43:18,383
Okay.

00:43:20,185 --> 00:43:22,454
So who wants to go first?

00:43:25,157 --> 00:43:26,825
I don't think it matters.

00:43:26,892 --> 00:43:29,375
I'm sure our stories
are all the same.
