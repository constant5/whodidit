00:00:02,621 --> 00:00:04,371
<i>911.</i>
<i>What is your emergency?</i>

00:00:04,371 --> 00:00:05,788
MAN:
<i>Yes. There's been an accident.</i>

00:00:05,788 --> 00:00:07,523
<i>What kind of accident, sir?</i>

00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:08,924
<i>Please, ma'am, I need you</i>
<i>to send an ambulance.</i>

00:00:08,991 --> 00:00:09,925
<i>Please, just hurry.</i>

00:00:09,992 --> 00:00:11,227
<i>Sir, paramedics are en route.</i>

00:00:11,293 --> 00:00:13,429
Oh, my God!
Please, you've got to help me!

00:00:13,496 --> 00:00:14,129
Please, hurry!

00:00:14,196 --> 00:00:15,297
Sir, where are you injured?

00:00:15,364 --> 00:00:16,499
What? No, not me, my wife!

00:00:23,072 --> 00:00:24,740
De-fib.

00:00:24,807 --> 00:00:25,741
What does that mean?

00:00:25,808 --> 00:00:27,209
Sir, please stand back.

00:00:33,148 --> 00:00:37,052
( <i>steady tone</i> )

00:00:42,424 --> 00:00:44,193
There was an emergency call out,

00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:45,294
the paramedics
responded.

00:00:45,361 --> 00:00:46,295
They found

00:00:46,362 --> 00:00:48,430
Mrs. Lester
in the back stairs.

00:00:48,497 --> 00:00:52,468
They pronounced at 12:16 a.m.

00:00:55,204 --> 00:00:56,772
And, of course, you walked
through the house.

00:00:56,839 --> 00:00:58,607
We were responding
to a traumatic injury.

00:00:58,674 --> 00:01:00,242
Our priority was
to assist the victim.

00:01:01,677 --> 00:01:03,746
WOMAN ( <i>over radio</i> ):
141, you cut off

00:01:03,812 --> 00:01:05,648
on the first and middle name...

00:01:13,022 --> 00:01:15,724
BRASS:
That's Ray Lester,
the vic's husband.

00:01:17,493 --> 00:01:18,694
WILLOWS:
Was he injured?

00:01:18,761 --> 00:01:23,299
No, uh, that's
his wife's blood.

00:01:23,365 --> 00:01:25,835
He said he checked
to see if she was
still alive

00:01:25,901 --> 00:01:28,771
and he held her until
the paramedics came.

00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:30,840
Wouldn't you?

00:01:30,906 --> 00:01:33,409
You never met my ex.

00:01:43,786 --> 00:01:45,554
Tequila will always remind me
of Señor Frog's.

00:01:45,621 --> 00:01:47,022
BRASS:
Which one?

00:01:47,089 --> 00:01:50,593
Cancun.
My honeymoon.

00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:51,894
My dime.

00:01:51,961 --> 00:01:54,530
Well, if you ever want
to go back, it's on me.

00:01:54,597 --> 00:01:56,932
Is that a proposal?

00:02:04,507 --> 00:02:07,042
HODGES:
It's like
the Red Sea in here.

00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:10,179
The Red Sea's not red, David.

00:02:10,246 --> 00:02:12,848
No, it's blue from afar and
transparent when held in hand,

00:02:12,915 --> 00:02:14,884
like any other
body of water.

00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:16,418
I was just speaking
figuratively.

00:02:16,485 --> 00:02:17,620
I'm assuming

00:02:17,686 --> 00:02:19,955
those boot prints aren't yours.

00:02:20,022 --> 00:02:22,358
Please, I was just waiting
for you guys to clear a path.

00:02:22,424 --> 00:02:24,326
Blame the paramedics.

00:02:24,393 --> 00:02:27,863
This girl's head and spine
are perfectly aligned.

00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,031
Yeah, when you fall down

00:02:29,098 --> 00:02:31,167
the stairs, your head tends
to go in one direction,

00:02:31,233 --> 00:02:32,234
your body in another.

00:02:32,301 --> 00:02:33,702
I'll take a statement
from the husband

00:02:33,769 --> 00:02:35,437
and the paramedics;
see if she was moved.

00:02:35,504 --> 00:02:36,872
You know, twice
as many people

00:02:36,939 --> 00:02:39,074
die each year
from falling down stairs

00:02:39,141 --> 00:02:40,643
than from accidental gunfire?

00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:41,744
You didn't just get back

00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,579
from one of those coroner's
conferences, did you?

00:02:47,349 --> 00:02:48,417
What are you thinking?

Hey.

00:03:52,287 --> 00:03:53,355
Back stairs.

want to hug the wall.

Never mind.

00:04:07,435 --> 00:04:09,304
We don't get another boot
allowance till spring.

00:04:09,371 --> 00:04:10,538
Well, I'll try
to get 'em back to you

00:04:10,605 --> 00:04:12,040
before your next shift, okay?

00:04:12,107 --> 00:04:13,942
Uh, one more question:
Did either

00:04:14,009 --> 00:04:15,910
of you guys
move the body?
Didn't have to.

00:04:15,977 --> 00:04:17,712
She was faceup.
I unbuttoned her blouse

00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:19,280
to apply the leads,
but that's it.

00:04:19,347 --> 00:04:20,348
We tried not to touch anything.

00:04:20,415 --> 00:04:23,251
Once we saw that blood,
we knew you'd be showing up.

00:04:24,819 --> 00:04:26,288
GRISSOM:
Becky Lester.

00:04:26,354 --> 00:04:28,456
Catherine and I got here
a half an hour after

00:04:28,523 --> 00:04:31,826
her husband called 911.

00:04:31,893 --> 00:04:32,961
Edges of the blood pools

00:04:33,028 --> 00:04:34,162
were already dry.

00:04:34,229 --> 00:04:36,464
The pools themselves were tacky.

00:04:36,531 --> 00:04:39,200
Which means she'd been down here
at least an hour or two

00:04:39,267 --> 00:04:40,835
before you guys even got here.

00:04:40,902 --> 00:04:43,271
Why did the husband wait so long
to call?

00:04:43,338 --> 00:04:44,272
Good question.

00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:45,674
Coroner won't touch the body

00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,842
till Catherine and I are done
processing around it,

00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:49,944
so, Sara, would you please
go up the front stairs

00:04:50,011 --> 00:04:51,413
and work your way down
the back stairs?

00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:52,447
You got it.

00:04:52,514 --> 00:04:53,481
Warrick, could you

00:04:53,548 --> 00:04:55,283
process the blood evidence
from the front door

00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,351
to the back stairwell?

00:04:56,418 --> 00:04:57,585
And if you'll notice,

00:04:57,652 --> 00:04:59,554
she doesn't have any blood
on her feet.

00:04:59,621 --> 00:05:02,390
So I can assume those bloody
footprints aren't hers.

00:05:02,457 --> 00:05:04,693
Nick, Brass is in the study
with the husband

00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:06,127
and he's waiting for you.

00:05:20,542 --> 00:05:21,977
( <i>camera clicks</i> )

00:05:58,313 --> 00:06:00,248
( <i>camera clicks</i> )

00:06:22,003 --> 00:06:24,139
WILLOWS:
Hey, Grissom,

00:06:24,205 --> 00:06:27,175
spatter on the wall
doesn't exceed 18 inches.

00:06:27,242 --> 00:06:30,011
Well, that's consistent
with the fall.

00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:38,753
Guys,

00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,355
if she fell,

00:06:40,422 --> 00:06:42,657
even if she was pushed down
these stairs,

00:06:42,724 --> 00:06:45,627
I would expect to find smudge
marks on these walls.

00:06:45,694 --> 00:06:46,761
Yeah, she would've

00:06:46,828 --> 00:06:48,263
instinctively reached out
for leverage.

00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:49,597
There are none.

00:06:49,664 --> 00:06:52,200
Not to mention,
that if she was up here

00:06:52,267 --> 00:06:54,736
before she was down there...

00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:58,039
...she should've landed
headfirst.

00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:04,379
The body position is
inconsistent with the fall.

00:07:04,446 --> 00:07:06,948
Well, it's inconsistent
if she fell <i>down</i> the stairs.

00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:10,185
Maybe she fell up.

00:07:19,361 --> 00:07:20,795
Catherine,

00:07:20,862 --> 00:07:22,330
can I borrow your micrometer?

00:07:27,435 --> 00:07:31,339
Blood spatter measures
two millimeters.

00:07:31,406 --> 00:07:32,474
Medium spatter.

00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:35,210
Suggests impact
with a blunt object.

00:07:38,647 --> 00:07:41,850
But if she was hit,
where's the castoff?

00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,855
It is a low ceiling.

00:07:46,921 --> 00:07:48,590
Pretty hard to swing a weapon.

00:07:48,657 --> 00:07:51,793
Sometimes first blush
gives you a head rush.

00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,864
I don't think
I moved her.

00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,999
I mean, I cradled
her head in my lap.

00:07:58,066 --> 00:08:01,670
Tried to wake her up,
but that's it.

00:08:01,736 --> 00:08:04,039
So, you and your wife went
to Pieros for dinner,

00:08:04,105 --> 00:08:05,340
got home around 10:00.

00:08:05,407 --> 00:08:06,474
Got out the tequila,

00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:07,909
then what?

00:08:07,976 --> 00:08:09,978
I, you know, got comfortable...

00:08:10,045 --> 00:08:12,681
then we went outside
and did a few shots.

00:08:12,747 --> 00:08:14,516
How'd the tequila
get back inside?

00:08:14,582 --> 00:08:17,519
Um, the phone rang
and it was my daughter Susan.

00:08:17,585 --> 00:08:18,687
Your daughter?

00:08:18,753 --> 00:08:21,022
Yeah, from my first marriage.

00:08:21,089 --> 00:08:23,358
She's, she's staying
at Becky's dad's.

00:08:23,425 --> 00:08:26,394
All right. It's Susan.

00:08:26,461 --> 00:08:29,030
Oh. Hey, babe.

00:08:29,097 --> 00:08:30,732
Uh-huh.

00:08:30,799 --> 00:08:32,734
Okay.

00:08:32,801 --> 00:08:34,002
It's boy trouble.

00:08:35,337 --> 00:08:36,838
I'll take this inside.

00:08:39,007 --> 00:08:40,308
What did you do after that?

00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:45,113
Another shot or two and
then I guess I fell asleep.

00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,115
And I woke up
around midnight.

00:08:47,182 --> 00:08:48,750
And I figured that

00:08:48,817 --> 00:08:50,952
she and Susan had just gotten
into one of their talk-a-thons.

00:08:52,187 --> 00:08:55,290
<i>I took the tequila and</i>
<i>the glasses into the kitchen</i>

00:08:55,357 --> 00:08:56,491
<i>and that's when I saw her.</i>

00:08:56,558 --> 00:08:57,926
Oh, my God.

00:08:59,527 --> 00:09:01,930
Oh, please!
Oh, please, please!

00:09:01,997 --> 00:09:05,300
Oh, my God...
Oh, my God...

00:09:11,706 --> 00:09:13,942
Now, is there any reason
you can think of

00:09:14,009 --> 00:09:16,244
why your wife would be using
the back stairs?

00:09:16,311 --> 00:09:18,580
From the kitchen,
it's closer to
the bedroom.

00:09:18,647 --> 00:09:20,615
You never mentioned anything
about the bedroom.

00:09:20,682 --> 00:09:22,617
Are you trying
to trip me up or something?

00:09:22,684 --> 00:09:23,752
I mean, I don't...

00:09:23,818 --> 00:09:25,453
maybe she went to,
uh, brush her teeth

00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,988
or put on her nightgown.
I really don't know.

00:09:27,055 --> 00:09:29,124
Okay, sir. I'm going to need
to take your clothing.

00:09:31,726 --> 00:09:33,295
I'll go upstairs and change.

00:09:33,361 --> 00:09:36,031
No, that's okay.
We're still processing upstairs.

00:09:36,097 --> 00:09:37,499
You can remove them
right here

00:09:37,565 --> 00:09:38,933
and I'll give you
a jumpsuit.

00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,969
I'll close my eyes,
if you're shy.

00:09:51,546 --> 00:09:54,349
Those don't look
like mosquito bites.

00:09:56,051 --> 00:09:59,821
My wife likes to bite,
and I don't mind it, okay?

00:09:59,888 --> 00:10:01,823
Okay.

00:10:12,567 --> 00:10:14,736
Okay,

00:10:14,803 --> 00:10:17,539
the husband says
he fell asleep,
he woke up

00:10:17,605 --> 00:10:19,207
his wife was dead.

00:10:19,274 --> 00:10:21,209
He's a good sleeper.

00:10:21,276 --> 00:10:23,144
Yeah, I'm sure he's gonna say
something like that.

00:10:23,211 --> 00:10:24,212
Anyway, there's a daughter.

00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:25,647
She spent the night

00:10:25,714 --> 00:10:27,082
at her grandfather's,
who lives a few blocks away.

00:10:27,148 --> 00:10:28,149
I'm gonna check it out.

00:10:28,216 --> 00:10:29,918
BROWN:
I'm ready.

00:10:33,121 --> 00:10:36,091
The blue markers denote
the footprints.

00:10:36,157 --> 00:10:38,760
They're all consistent
with the husband.

00:10:49,437 --> 00:10:51,906
The footprints are associated
with gravitational blood drops.

00:10:59,147 --> 00:11:02,217
The yellow markers denote
the paramedics' boot prints.

00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:12,627
And what about this
here, on the counter?

00:11:12,694 --> 00:11:13,662
It's a single
blood drop.

00:11:13,728 --> 00:11:14,796
I'm thinking
that's from when

00:11:14,863 --> 00:11:16,431
the husband reached
for the phone.

00:11:19,601 --> 00:11:21,536
That's a good observation.

00:11:21,603 --> 00:11:23,071
What do you got in the bag?

00:11:23,138 --> 00:11:27,642
This...

00:11:27,709 --> 00:11:29,778
is a bloody paper towel
I found in the trash.

00:11:29,844 --> 00:11:31,413
It's too textured to print,

00:11:31,479 --> 00:11:33,348
but Sanders talked
to the paramedics,

00:11:33,415 --> 00:11:34,482
who confirmed
that it wasn't theirs.

00:11:34,549 --> 00:11:35,817
I'm thinking it was from
the husband

00:11:35,884 --> 00:11:38,153
when he tried to clean up and
saw it wouldn't be too easy.

00:11:38,219 --> 00:11:39,821
Lucky for us.

00:12:09,584 --> 00:12:13,588
♪ ♪

00:12:29,904 --> 00:12:31,339
Hey.

00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:34,943
Husband slept in the other room.

00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:36,945
His reading glasses are
on the nightstand.

00:12:37,012 --> 00:12:38,113
Clothing's in the dresser.

00:12:38,179 --> 00:12:40,015
That's odd.

00:12:40,081 --> 00:12:43,184
A man and a woman, who
don't share a bedroom,

00:12:43,251 --> 00:12:45,987
arrange to have a night alone,

00:12:46,054 --> 00:12:47,656
send their daughter
to a relative,

00:12:47,722 --> 00:12:51,793
go out to dinner,
have drinks by the pool,

00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,862
but they sleep
in separate bedrooms.

00:12:53,928 --> 00:12:59,634
Maybe one of them snored
or had insomnia

00:12:59,701 --> 00:13:01,970
or liked to work at night.

00:13:02,037 --> 00:13:04,472
Or maybe they were suffocating
each other

00:13:04,539 --> 00:13:06,074
and he couldn't breathe.

00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:16,918
Sexual lubricant.

00:13:16,985 --> 00:13:20,722
It's half empty. Sticky.

00:13:20,789 --> 00:13:24,626
You know, you don't have to
sleep in the same bed together

00:13:24,693 --> 00:13:25,860
to have sex

00:13:25,927 --> 00:13:27,495
or...

00:13:27,562 --> 00:13:29,097
have romance.

00:13:31,933 --> 00:13:34,869
I'm going to go see the doctor.

00:13:37,105 --> 00:13:38,740
I'll grid the house.

00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,549
I don't understand.

00:13:47,615 --> 00:13:51,019
Becky was in perfect health.

00:13:51,086 --> 00:13:52,187
Can I see her?

00:13:52,253 --> 00:13:53,688
I'd like to see my daughter.

00:13:53,755 --> 00:13:55,457
BRASS:
Well, her body's with
the coroner, sir.

00:13:55,523 --> 00:13:58,426
There will be an autopsy as
a part of our investigation.

00:13:58,493 --> 00:14:00,795
But you said she fell.

00:14:00,862 --> 00:14:04,466
Yeah, um, if you don't mind,

00:14:04,532 --> 00:14:06,868
I'd like to ask you both
a few questions.

00:14:06,935 --> 00:14:08,870
Anything.
When was the last time

00:14:08,937 --> 00:14:10,271
either of you saw her?

00:14:10,338 --> 00:14:11,640
When she dropped Susan off

00:14:11,706 --> 00:14:12,874
yesterday evening,

00:14:12,941 --> 00:14:14,776
she came in for
a few minutes.

00:14:14,843 --> 00:14:17,545
Said she was headed home
and out to dinner with Ray.

00:14:17,612 --> 00:14:19,714
And that's the last time
you spoke with her.

00:14:19,781 --> 00:14:21,650
Yeah.
No.

00:14:23,284 --> 00:14:25,120
I called her.

00:14:25,186 --> 00:14:28,757
A little after 10:00,
after Grandpa went to bed.

00:14:28,823 --> 00:14:29,924
What did you talk about?

00:14:29,991 --> 00:14:30,992
Why is that important?

00:14:31,059 --> 00:14:32,060
Well...

00:14:32,127 --> 00:14:35,463
Stupid stuff.

00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:39,567
My best friend Jamila
and I, we both like Leon.

00:14:39,634 --> 00:14:42,237
And I know,
friendship first.

00:14:42,304 --> 00:14:45,273
I just wanted Becky to say it,
you know?

00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:48,009
Uh, yeah, okay.

00:14:48,076 --> 00:14:50,145
Thank you.
Thank you, Susan.

00:14:50,211 --> 00:14:52,981
Susan, would you give me
a moment with the detective?

00:14:53,048 --> 00:14:55,150
SUSAN:
Okay.

00:14:57,886 --> 00:15:02,023
You said you found my daughter's
body on the stairwell?

00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:04,092
That's right.

00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:08,029
You're aware that Ray's first
wife, Susan's mother,

00:15:08,096 --> 00:15:09,664
was found the same way?

00:15:09,731 --> 00:15:12,000
Well, now I am.

00:15:12,067 --> 00:15:15,337
They said Susan's mom died
of a stroke.

00:15:15,403 --> 00:15:16,538
But you don't think so?

00:15:16,604 --> 00:15:18,873
I never had any reason
to doubt it.

00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,276
So how would you, uh,
how would you characterize

00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,644
your daughter's marriage?

00:15:22,711 --> 00:15:24,779
Ups and downs.

00:15:24,846 --> 00:15:26,715
About a year ago, Ray's business
went under.

00:15:26,781 --> 00:15:28,783
And Becky works

00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:30,285
for Western Airlines.

00:15:30,352 --> 00:15:31,886
They've been downsizing
since 9/11.

00:15:31,953 --> 00:15:32,988
It's been rough.

00:15:33,054 --> 00:15:34,990
Yeah.

00:15:35,056 --> 00:15:39,394
Mr. Stein, does your son-in-law
have a temper?

00:15:39,461 --> 00:15:40,962
Do I have to answer that?

00:15:41,029 --> 00:15:42,897
You just did.

00:15:42,964 --> 00:15:48,136
Becky Lester, 32.
Final meal, pasta.

00:15:48,203 --> 00:15:51,473
I can't tell you the variety
of the noodle,

00:15:51,539 --> 00:15:53,508
but there was a white sauce
with clams.

00:15:53,575 --> 00:15:56,378
And I found some blood
in her stomach.

00:15:56,444 --> 00:15:58,980
Her tongue was lacerated
perimortem.

00:15:59,047 --> 00:16:01,549
She probably chomped down on it
when she hit the stairs.

00:16:01,616 --> 00:16:03,585
I sent a blood sample to tox

00:16:03,652 --> 00:16:04,819
and Nick asked for
teeth impressions.

00:16:04,886 --> 00:16:06,821
Husband claims she's a biter.

00:16:06,888 --> 00:16:08,857
Fine line between

00:16:08,923 --> 00:16:10,358
pleasure and pain.

00:16:10,425 --> 00:16:13,928
But who doesn't like to cross it
every once in a while, right?

00:16:13,995 --> 00:16:16,431
Anyway, um, I don't know

00:16:16,498 --> 00:16:17,832
if it's probative,

00:16:17,899 --> 00:16:20,035
but there's semen
in her vaginal vault.

00:16:20,101 --> 00:16:22,671
Sperm motility and
positive acid phosphates

00:16:22,737 --> 00:16:24,739
suggest intercourse
approximately

00:16:24,806 --> 00:16:26,608
six to 12 hours
prior to death.

00:16:26,675 --> 00:16:28,576
Yeah, I'm mostly interested
in cause.

00:16:28,643 --> 00:16:31,212
Exsanguination from
five lacerations:

00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,748
Two to the forehead,
one to the right temple,

00:16:33,815 --> 00:16:35,116
and two to the occipital bone.

00:16:35,183 --> 00:16:36,451
Are they consistent
with a fall?

00:16:36,518 --> 00:16:38,920
Yes, but I'd expect to see
hand fractures as a result

00:16:38,987 --> 00:16:40,422
of the impact,
and there are none.

00:16:40,488 --> 00:16:42,190
Are they consistent with
blunt force trauma?

00:16:42,257 --> 00:16:44,292
Sure, but if the husband
bludgeoned her,

00:16:44,359 --> 00:16:45,727
there'd be fractures
to the skull.

00:16:47,095 --> 00:16:48,029
And there are none.

00:16:48,096 --> 00:16:49,931
None.

00:16:49,998 --> 00:16:52,600
Well, you've given me
a lot of information, Doc,

00:16:52,667 --> 00:16:54,769
and none of it very helpful.

00:17:08,531 --> 00:17:10,156
You want fries with that?

00:17:13,573 --> 00:17:16,117
Robbins said the vic
bit her tongue.

00:17:16,184 --> 00:17:17,865
Theoretically,
she could've expirated

00:17:17,906 --> 00:17:18,974
the blood on the wall,

00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:20,809
providing an alternative
explanation

00:17:20,876 --> 00:17:22,244
for the medium velocity spatter.

00:17:23,378 --> 00:17:24,413
Do me a favor,

00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:25,814
check it out.

00:17:33,222 --> 00:17:35,891
Well, it looks like
two millimeters.

00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:39,361
Same as the blood at the scene.

00:17:39,428 --> 00:17:42,464
So, maybe it was
just an accident.

00:17:45,667 --> 00:17:47,236
GRISSOM:
<i>As she tried to get up,</i>

00:17:47,302 --> 00:17:48,837
<i>she expirated the blood</i>
<i>on the wall.</i>

00:17:48,904 --> 00:17:53,475
<i>She failed to regain her</i>
<i>footing, impacting her temple</i>

00:17:53,542 --> 00:17:55,878
and then she bounced on her
occipital bone.

00:17:55,944 --> 00:17:59,781
So we've got two theories, both
supported by physical evidence.

00:17:59,848 --> 00:18:02,417
Yeah, if we ever find a murder
weapon, my theory's done.

00:18:02,484 --> 00:18:04,686
Well, I know that there was
no blood found in the car,

00:18:04,753 --> 00:18:06,421
so it's unlikely that Ray

00:18:06,488 --> 00:18:08,323
took a drive to dispose
of the weapon.

00:18:10,025 --> 00:18:11,526
Hey, ready for a quiz?

00:18:11,593 --> 00:18:13,562
Guess how Ray's first wife died?

00:18:13,629 --> 00:18:16,431
Wait. She had a stroke
on a stairway.

00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:18,934
Robbins told me.

00:18:19,001 --> 00:18:20,802
Is that the autopsy
report?

00:18:20,869 --> 00:18:23,405
No, these are medical records.
There was no autopsy.

00:18:23,472 --> 00:18:24,940
Jackie Lester had
a heart condition.

00:18:25,007 --> 00:18:26,441
Three weeks
before she died,

00:18:26,508 --> 00:18:28,176
she was admitted
to a hospital with vertigo.

00:18:28,243 --> 00:18:30,078
She ignored the doctor's
warnings,

00:18:30,145 --> 00:18:31,446
didn't take her medication.

00:18:31,513 --> 00:18:33,415
Family physician pronounced it
a stroke.

00:18:33,482 --> 00:18:35,817
WILLOWS:
Well, if she wasn't cremated,

00:18:35,884 --> 00:18:39,121
it's not too late for
a postmortem examination.

00:18:39,187 --> 00:18:41,056
Judge Witherspoon is issuing
a court order for exhumation.

00:18:41,123 --> 00:18:43,025
Now, look,
I just came from the DA.

00:18:43,091 --> 00:18:45,460
I gotta tell you,
he's already made up his mind.

00:18:45,527 --> 00:18:47,429
Husband and wife, home alone,
all that blood,

00:18:47,496 --> 00:18:48,897
shaky alibi.

00:18:48,964 --> 00:18:50,832
Plus, he says,
"He just looks guilty."

00:18:50,899 --> 00:18:53,302
How does one "look" guilty?

00:18:53,368 --> 00:18:55,904
You know,
I'm just a messenger.

00:18:55,971 --> 00:18:57,172
What do you think

00:18:57,239 --> 00:18:58,273
the chances are
he didn't do it?

00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,274
Well, what do
you think

00:18:59,341 --> 00:19:00,275
the chances are

00:19:00,342 --> 00:19:01,376
we're going to give you
an answer

00:19:01,443 --> 00:19:02,477
before all the evidence is in?

00:19:02,544 --> 00:19:04,513
Greg...

00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:07,783
Becky Lester had a B.A.L.
of point one-eight.

00:19:07,849 --> 00:19:09,318
And I found trace
amounts of Diazepam.

00:19:09,384 --> 00:19:10,319
Thanks!

00:19:10,385 --> 00:19:11,954
Hey, I heard the
coroner found semen,

00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,789
so I tested for
birth control.

00:19:13,855 --> 00:19:15,691
Estrogen and progesterone
levels were spiked.

00:19:15,757 --> 00:19:17,726
Where did you hear about
the coroner's findings?

00:19:17,793 --> 00:19:19,094
Actually, I read
the report.

00:19:19,161 --> 00:19:21,363
Maybe I don't want to be a
toxicologist my whole life.

00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:23,298
I mean, you went from
DNA to the field,

00:19:23,365 --> 00:19:25,500
and I guess you're kind
of a role model to me.

00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,602
A role model, huh?

00:19:26,668 --> 00:19:29,137
Yeah. By the way, where
do you get your hair cut?

00:19:59,334 --> 00:20:00,369
( <i>sniffs</i> )

00:20:13,315 --> 00:20:14,816
Quick. How many teeth
in the human mouth?

00:20:14,883 --> 00:20:16,852
Without wisdoms? 28.

00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:19,988
Yep, and the 28 teeth
in Becky's mouth

00:20:20,055 --> 00:20:21,290
do not match
the bite impressions

00:20:21,356 --> 00:20:22,524
on her husband's body.

00:20:22,591 --> 00:20:23,892
I guess Ray found himself

00:20:23,959 --> 00:20:25,527
another set of pearly whites.

00:20:25,594 --> 00:20:29,598
Look, I loved my wife.

00:20:29,665 --> 00:20:32,768
But, a year into our marriage,

00:20:32,834 --> 00:20:35,637
she told me that
she wasn't into sex anymore.

00:20:35,704 --> 00:20:39,208
And, uh, she went frigid on me.

00:20:39,274 --> 00:20:41,476
Asked me to move
into the other bedroom.

00:20:42,477 --> 00:20:44,379
And you were okay with that?

00:20:44,446 --> 00:20:47,082
Well, I kept hoping things
would get better.

00:20:47,149 --> 00:20:51,920
And we had fun and we
respected each other.

00:20:51,987 --> 00:20:54,089
And she was a
great mom to Susan.

00:20:54,156 --> 00:20:56,792
I'm still confused
about the bite marks.

00:20:56,858 --> 00:20:59,861
I found a way to make our
relationship work.

00:20:59,928 --> 00:21:01,730
You found yourself a vampire?

00:21:01,797 --> 00:21:03,932
I met a girl online.

00:21:03,999 --> 00:21:05,734
She liked biting.
I liked being bit.

00:21:05,801 --> 00:21:08,470
It just seemed like a good
match, and it never got sexual.

00:21:08,537 --> 00:21:10,906
Uh-huh.

00:21:10,973 --> 00:21:13,375
And, uh, what is her name?

00:21:13,442 --> 00:21:19,948
I know her as
Buffy227@gmail.com.

00:21:20,015 --> 00:21:22,417
And your wife
never suspected anything?

00:21:22,484 --> 00:21:26,421
We'd meet at a motel...
every few weeks.

00:21:26,488 --> 00:21:28,824
I'd tell Becky
that I was going out for a bite.

00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:31,760
It was consensual

00:21:31,827 --> 00:21:33,562
and it wasn't sexual.

00:21:33,629 --> 00:21:35,664
It was not cheating.

00:21:35,731 --> 00:21:38,133
But you never told your wife?

00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,969
I didn't tell Becky everything
I did every minute of the day,

00:21:41,036 --> 00:21:42,971
but that doesn't mean
that I was unfaithful.

00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:44,706
When, exactly, was the last time

00:21:44,773 --> 00:21:47,609
that you had sexual intercourse
with your late wife?

00:21:47,676 --> 00:21:48,810
Four years ago.

00:21:51,213 --> 00:21:54,383
Rosy Palm and Thumbelina are
the only action that I get.

00:21:56,318 --> 00:21:59,254
Uh, wow, you know, uh,
a joke like that

00:21:59,321 --> 00:22:02,024
doesn't quite seem appropriate
for a distraught husband.

00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:03,725
I'm just answering
the questions.

00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:11,033
Mr. Lester, did you know that
your wife was having an affair?

00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:17,973
The day that she died,
she had had intercourse.

00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:23,278
Are we done here?

00:22:23,345 --> 00:22:25,147
For now.

00:22:27,849 --> 00:22:30,052
( <i>computer beeping</i> )

00:22:30,118 --> 00:22:33,055
JOHNSON:
Ow... ooh.

00:22:33,121 --> 00:22:35,958
She's hot.

00:22:36,024 --> 00:22:38,660
But I still wouldn't
let her fang me.

00:22:38,727 --> 00:22:41,563
No, no.
I'm with you.

00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:43,932
Was the video encrypted?

00:22:43,999 --> 00:22:45,467
Uh, no.

00:22:45,534 --> 00:22:47,169
I was processing
Ray's computer

00:22:47,236 --> 00:22:49,338
and it was just sitting
on the desktop...

00:22:49,404 --> 00:22:51,206
in a folder called
"Dental Records."

00:22:51,273 --> 00:22:53,141
STOKES:
Did you get an I.D.
on Buffy?

00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:54,910
JOHNSON:
Grissom got us
an administrative subpoena.

00:22:54,977 --> 00:22:57,279
ISP sent over
the subscriber information:

00:22:57,346 --> 00:23:01,750
Dr. Jeri Cohen--
aka Buffy227--

00:23:01,817 --> 00:23:03,418
is a dentist.

00:23:03,485 --> 00:23:05,354
Are you kidding me?

00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,089
I could not make this stuff up.

00:23:08,757 --> 00:23:11,026
I'm not ashamed
of my predilection.

00:23:11,093 --> 00:23:13,328
Assuming both parties
are healthy,

00:23:13,395 --> 00:23:15,564
biting can be orgasmic.

00:23:15,631 --> 00:23:17,232
Huh.

00:23:17,299 --> 00:23:19,868
Dr. Cohen, where
were you last night?

00:23:19,935 --> 00:23:22,371
Home alone, like most nights.

00:23:22,437 --> 00:23:23,939
Ma'am, we're here
to talk about

00:23:24,006 --> 00:23:25,240
your relationship
with Ray Lester.

00:23:25,307 --> 00:23:27,342
Well, I wouldn't call it
a relationship, per se.

00:23:27,409 --> 00:23:29,077
There was no sex, no commitment.

00:23:29,144 --> 00:23:32,047
We'd meet at a motel room,
once or twice a month.

00:23:32,114 --> 00:23:34,583
You e-mailed Ray
digital video

00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:36,919
of your sessions together.

00:23:36,985 --> 00:23:42,190
Ray bought me that camera
for, uh, my birthday.

00:23:42,257 --> 00:23:43,492
It was fun.

00:23:46,261 --> 00:23:47,529
If you say so.

00:23:47,596 --> 00:23:48,931
The Kama Sutra says

00:23:48,997 --> 00:23:51,567
that any place on the body
that can be kissed

00:23:51,633 --> 00:23:53,235
can also be bitten.

00:23:53,302 --> 00:23:55,737
Except the upper lip,

00:23:55,804 --> 00:23:58,674
the interior of the mouth,
and, of course, the eye.

00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,509
It also goes on to describe

00:24:00,576 --> 00:24:03,111
eight different ways
to bite your partner.

00:24:03,178 --> 00:24:05,614
Ray liked "the broken cloud."

00:24:05,681 --> 00:24:07,616
Teeth...

00:24:07,683 --> 00:24:10,118
are sexual organs.

00:24:10,185 --> 00:24:12,588
( <i>clears throat</i> ):
Um, Dr. Cohen, did, uh...

00:24:12,654 --> 00:24:15,157
did, uh...
Ray.

00:24:15,224 --> 00:24:17,559
...Ray ever mention his wife?

00:24:17,626 --> 00:24:19,127
He told me he was married.

00:24:19,194 --> 00:24:20,596
It wasn't a problem for me.

00:24:20,662 --> 00:24:22,097
He said they made
better friends

00:24:22,164 --> 00:24:24,499
than lovers and she was
a good mother, that's about it.

00:24:24,566 --> 00:24:27,002
Was he violent?
Ray?

00:24:27,069 --> 00:24:29,571
No, he was nothing like that.

00:24:33,942 --> 00:24:34,943
See?

00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:36,578
No bite marks.

00:24:36,645 --> 00:24:38,480
I'm the aggressor.

00:24:38,547 --> 00:24:40,782
Ray just lies there
and takes it.

00:24:40,849 --> 00:24:42,951
He's a real sweetheart.

00:24:43,018 --> 00:24:45,187
( <i>clears throat</i> )

00:24:45,254 --> 00:24:46,655
Uh, ma'am...

00:24:51,526 --> 00:24:53,795
Would you mind
biting down on this for me?

00:24:53,862 --> 00:24:56,465
You know I wouldn't.

00:24:58,166 --> 00:25:01,003
They don't tell you about
this part of the job

00:25:01,069 --> 00:25:02,971
when you're training
to become a CSI.

00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:04,606
Come on, after
five years,

00:25:04,673 --> 00:25:06,308
at least they don't
smell anymore.

00:25:06,375 --> 00:25:08,277
Always with
the silver lining.

00:25:08,343 --> 00:25:09,444
Right.

00:25:09,511 --> 00:25:11,513
You ready?

00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:14,049
( <i>lid creaking</i> )

00:25:14,116 --> 00:25:15,884
Well, hello, Jackie Lester.

00:25:15,951 --> 00:25:18,520
On three.

00:25:21,089 --> 00:25:23,992
One... two...

00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:26,228
( <i>grunting</i> ):
Three.

00:25:31,567 --> 00:25:34,002
If you two don't mind...

00:25:36,071 --> 00:25:38,006
...we'd like some alone time.

00:25:44,739 --> 00:25:49,744
♪ ♪

00:26:22,576 --> 00:26:25,479
♪ ♪

00:26:44,322 --> 00:26:45,866
You done with your
alone time, Doc?

00:26:45,933 --> 00:26:48,536
Just completed my prelim,
but check this out.

00:26:48,602 --> 00:26:51,372
Subgaleal hemorrhages,
consistent with

00:26:51,439 --> 00:26:53,240
lacerations
to the occipital bone.

00:26:53,307 --> 00:26:56,811
So both of Ray's wives end up
dead at the bottom of the stairs

00:26:56,877 --> 00:26:58,212
with lacerations to the head.

00:26:58,279 --> 00:27:00,314
If my full autopsy
confirms murder,

00:27:00,381 --> 00:27:02,083
you maybe looking
at the first

00:27:02,149 --> 00:27:03,818
serial stairway killer.

00:27:03,884 --> 00:27:05,286
If there was
a murder weapon,

00:27:05,353 --> 00:27:06,721
it was not in that house.

00:27:06,787 --> 00:27:07,722
We searched everywhere.

00:27:07,788 --> 00:27:08,789
What's in the bag?

00:27:08,856 --> 00:27:10,424
Sex lube, found
at the crime scene.

00:27:10,491 --> 00:27:12,793
Autopsy revealed that Becky
was sexually active.

00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,395
Ray claims that
they've both been celibate

00:27:14,462 --> 00:27:15,596
for the past four years.

00:27:15,663 --> 00:27:18,199
And you wanted to see
if her lover's prints

00:27:18,265 --> 00:27:19,567
were on that bottle.

00:27:19,634 --> 00:27:22,136
Two viable prints, both
in a light coat of lube.

00:27:22,203 --> 00:27:24,639
One was Becky's and the other
is an Adam Gilford.

00:27:24,705 --> 00:27:26,307
Work card is in the system.

00:27:26,374 --> 00:27:28,042
He's an executive
at Western Airlines.

00:27:28,109 --> 00:27:31,312
Lovers and co-workers.
That never works.

00:27:31,379 --> 00:27:33,180
If Ray did find out

00:27:33,247 --> 00:27:35,750
about the affair,
that's motive.

00:27:35,816 --> 00:27:38,252
GILFORD:
Of course I knew Becky Lester.

00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:40,788
I'm her boss.
I'm the one who hired her.

00:27:40,855 --> 00:27:43,924
Hard to believe
that was six years ago.

00:27:43,991 --> 00:27:46,527
And it's such a tragedy.

00:27:46,594 --> 00:27:48,796
She was loved.

00:27:48,863 --> 00:27:50,898
By some more than others.

00:27:50,965 --> 00:27:52,700
Excuse me?

00:27:52,767 --> 00:27:54,802
Mr. Gilford, we know
that the two of you

00:27:54,869 --> 00:27:55,803
were sleeping together.

00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:59,640
Becky wasn't in love with Ray.

00:27:59,707 --> 00:28:02,143
They'd stopped
having sex.

00:28:02,209 --> 00:28:03,878
If they divorced,
she'd owe him alimony,

00:28:03,944 --> 00:28:05,613
and Becky didn't think
that was right.

00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,248
Becky told you that?

00:28:07,315 --> 00:28:08,316
She told me
everything.

00:28:08,382 --> 00:28:10,217
She and Ray were
living on vapors.

00:28:10,284 --> 00:28:12,286
They'd just taken
a second on the house.

00:28:12,353 --> 00:28:14,388
She also told me that Ray
was hiding money from her--

00:28:14,455 --> 00:28:17,291
the insurance payout
on his first wife.

00:28:17,358 --> 00:28:20,494
Look, if you suspect
she was murdered,

00:28:20,561 --> 00:28:22,496
I can tell you why Ray did it.

00:28:22,563 --> 00:28:24,598
We're listening.

00:28:24,665 --> 00:28:26,567
At Western Airlines,
VP's and above

00:28:26,634 --> 00:28:28,769
receive corporate
life insurance policies.

00:28:28,836 --> 00:28:30,571
Quarter mil payouts.

00:28:30,638 --> 00:28:33,407
Last week, a round of
pink slips went out.

00:28:33,474 --> 00:28:35,443
We both got hit.

00:28:35,509 --> 00:28:37,945
Two weeks, she would
have been out of here.

00:28:38,012 --> 00:28:40,381
And the insurance
policy, suspended.

00:28:40,448 --> 00:28:41,983
And Ray is the beneficiary.

00:28:42,049 --> 00:28:45,820
He killed her
just in time to make a killing.

00:28:55,663 --> 00:28:57,598
DA's planning
to file charges

00:28:57,665 --> 00:28:59,700
against Ray Lester--
tomorrow,

00:28:59,767 --> 00:29:02,269
after an ADA stops by
the crime lab

00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,671
for a full briefing.

00:29:03,738 --> 00:29:05,272
That's too soon.

00:29:05,339 --> 00:29:07,108
Tell me about the first wife.

00:29:07,174 --> 00:29:09,343
Preliminary investigations
suggests foul play,

00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:12,380
but we've got nothing definitive
until she's fully posted.

00:29:12,446 --> 00:29:14,048
And the physical
evidence

00:29:14,115 --> 00:29:16,651
in Becky Lester's death
is completely ambiguous.

00:29:16,717 --> 00:29:19,720
The DA figures he'll
make a headline while you find

00:29:19,787 --> 00:29:21,622
corroborating
evidence.

00:29:21,689 --> 00:29:23,124
You think he's guilty, right?

00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:25,026
I don't think that yet.

00:29:25,092 --> 00:29:27,695
Oh, um, am I
interrupting?

00:29:27,762 --> 00:29:30,364
No.
Brass just called
with a heads up.

00:29:30,431 --> 00:29:33,467
Since when does the DA's office
tell us when we're ready?

00:29:33,534 --> 00:29:35,102
When the case is high profile

00:29:35,169 --> 00:29:37,705
and the DA is feeling heat
from the sheriff.

00:29:37,772 --> 00:29:39,840
Look, you'll just walk him
through the evidence.

00:29:39,907 --> 00:29:42,510
You won't bias your reports
or skip anything ambiguous.

00:29:42,576 --> 00:29:43,644
It is what it is.

00:29:43,711 --> 00:29:45,946
If the DA wants to shoot
his wad too early,

00:29:46,013 --> 00:29:47,214
we can't stop him.

00:29:47,281 --> 00:29:49,383
Okay.

00:29:53,621 --> 00:29:55,823
Sarah and I may have
uncovered motive.

00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:57,858
In the last two weeks,
Ray filled out

00:29:57,925 --> 00:29:59,527
five loan applications.

00:29:59,593 --> 00:30:01,929
200 G's a pop.
All denied.

00:30:01,996 --> 00:30:03,764
With his wife dead,

00:30:03,831 --> 00:30:07,335
he is the beneficiary
of a $250,000 policy.

00:30:07,401 --> 00:30:08,502
Huh.

00:30:08,569 --> 00:30:11,505
I wonder what
he needed the money for.

00:30:11,572 --> 00:30:15,009
I was... being blackmailed.

00:30:15,076 --> 00:30:17,778
Um, someone found
out about Buffy.

00:30:17,845 --> 00:30:21,048
I... I got a letter
and a photo in the mail.

00:30:21,115 --> 00:30:24,452
They wanted 200 grand
or the....

00:30:24,518 --> 00:30:30,391
Otherwise, they'd share your
biting secret with your wife.

00:30:30,458 --> 00:30:32,960
Yeah.

00:30:33,027 --> 00:30:35,863
Our marriage
was having enough problems.

00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:37,698
I mean, you're covered
in those bite marks.

00:30:37,765 --> 00:30:39,734
Didn't your wife ever ask
where they came from?

00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,803
She hadn't seen me naked
in a long time.

00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:45,740
I just...
I would've been humiliated

00:30:45,806 --> 00:30:47,708
if she found out about Buffy.

00:30:47,775 --> 00:30:49,377
She was a great mom.

00:30:51,812 --> 00:30:55,216
And she kept... she kept me sane
when my business went under.

00:30:55,282 --> 00:30:58,152
You still have
the blackmail note?

00:30:58,219 --> 00:31:00,321
Yeah. I couldn't risk
letting Becky find it.

00:31:00,388 --> 00:31:03,190
Soon as I opened that letter,
it went right into my briefcase.

00:31:03,257 --> 00:31:04,792
I've got the only key.

00:31:08,129 --> 00:31:10,564

00:31:21,008 --> 00:31:24,178
P.O. Box was through a private

with a pseudonym: Abe Lincoln.

Ninhydrin picked up
six distinct prints.

00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:31,252
Five were
matched to Ray.

00:31:31,319 --> 00:31:32,987
What about the sixth?

00:31:33,054 --> 00:31:35,356
Becky Lester.

00:31:35,423 --> 00:31:36,624
Hold on.

00:31:36,691 --> 00:31:38,793
Ray told Brass that
Becky never saw that note,

00:31:38,859 --> 00:31:40,094
which means
he was lying.

00:31:40,161 --> 00:31:41,762
If she read the note,

00:31:41,829 --> 00:31:44,265
then it's possible
that Ray freaked out,

00:31:44,332 --> 00:31:46,200
bludgeoned her to death.

00:31:46,267 --> 00:31:48,336
What if Ray's telling the truth?

00:31:48,402 --> 00:31:49,804
Well, Catherine,
if he was,

00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:52,273
her fingerprints
would not be on this note.

00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:54,775
Unless she touched the letter
before it was sent,

00:31:54,842 --> 00:31:56,844
which would make her the sender.

00:31:56,911 --> 00:31:58,145
Well, that doesn't
make any sense.

00:31:58,212 --> 00:32:00,614
Becky thought that Ray was
squirreling away money.

00:32:00,681 --> 00:32:03,184
Maybe this is her way
of getting her hands on it.

00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:05,019
She used his fetish against him?

00:32:05,086 --> 00:32:07,688
She blackmailed her own husband,
knowing that he would pay up,

00:32:07,755 --> 00:32:09,490
so she wouldn't
find out his secret.

00:32:09,557 --> 00:32:11,025
That's ingenious.

00:32:11,092 --> 00:32:12,593
And really sad.

00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,729
( <i>chuckles</i> )
If it's true.

00:32:14,795 --> 00:32:17,431
Well, if Becky's saliva's
on that envelope,

00:32:17,498 --> 00:32:19,667
it's indisputable.

00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:28,432
This is a blood clot.

00:32:28,499 --> 00:32:29,700
Take a look.

00:32:31,869 --> 00:32:33,036
Huh.
The blood's continuous.

00:32:33,103 --> 00:32:34,638
Comes from deep within
the parenchyma.

00:32:34,705 --> 00:32:37,908
The first wife had a stroke
and it was fatal.

00:32:37,975 --> 00:32:39,676
What about
the scalp lacerations?

00:32:39,743 --> 00:32:40,677
Perimortum.

00:32:40,744 --> 00:32:41,812
So she must've hit her head

00:32:41,879 --> 00:32:43,147
on the stairs on the way down.

00:32:43,213 --> 00:32:46,250
Well, I can't tell you
about the second wife,

00:32:46,316 --> 00:32:48,051
but this was a natural.

00:33:01,131 --> 00:33:02,599
That's
the Western Airlines logo.

00:33:02,666 --> 00:33:04,034
Over the past few years,

( <i>phone rings</i> )

00:33:08,305 --> 00:33:11,208
If Becky wrote the note,
she wrote it at work.

00:33:11,275 --> 00:33:12,543
This is Catherine.

00:33:12,609 --> 00:33:14,912
Oh, yeah. I'm on my way.

00:33:16,346 --> 00:33:18,782
For the record, I think
you're filing prematurely.

00:33:18,849 --> 00:33:21,285
As always,
I value your opinion.

00:33:21,351 --> 00:33:23,554
But I'm confident in our
decision to move forward.

00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,155
But, come on, Grissom,

00:33:25,222 --> 00:33:27,391
granted the first death
was a natural--

00:33:27,458 --> 00:33:29,893
but two dead women,
married to the same guy,

00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,228
found in a stairwell?

00:33:31,295 --> 00:33:33,297
Lightning doesn't strike
in the same place twice.

00:33:33,363 --> 00:33:35,265
Actually, it does.

00:33:35,332 --> 00:33:36,867
The Empire State Building

Sorry,

00:33:42,673 --> 00:33:44,107
I got held up.

00:33:44,174 --> 00:33:45,676
No, you're just in time.

00:33:45,742 --> 00:33:46,910
Ms. Willows,

00:33:46,977 --> 00:33:49,246
Mr. Sinclair

00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:52,282
I'd be happy to.

00:33:52,349 --> 00:33:53,484
Ray and Becky Lester

00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:56,286
were unhappily married.

00:33:56,353 --> 00:33:59,923
She was having an affair
with her boss, he was indulging

00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:01,391
his biting fetish.

00:34:01,458 --> 00:34:03,660
They were having
financial problems.

00:34:03,727 --> 00:34:06,663
But Becky believed that Ray
was hiding money.

00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:09,266
Two weeks ago, Ray received
a blackmail note

00:34:09,333 --> 00:34:10,968
demanding 200 grand

00:34:11,034 --> 00:34:13,837
or the wife finds out
about Bite Girl.

00:34:13,904 --> 00:34:15,139
Well, we have just confirmed

00:34:15,205 --> 00:34:19,676
that the blackmailer and
the wife are one and the same.

00:34:19,743 --> 00:34:22,112
Based on what?

00:34:22,179 --> 00:34:23,781
The envelope
of the ransom note.

00:34:23,847 --> 00:34:24,982
DNA was a match.

00:34:25,048 --> 00:34:27,184
The wife was blackmailing
the husband?

00:34:27,251 --> 00:34:28,719
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:34:28,786 --> 00:34:30,721
Never underestimate
the deviousness

00:34:30,788 --> 00:34:32,156
of a malcontented spouse.

00:34:32,222 --> 00:34:34,358
He found out and he killed her.

00:34:34,424 --> 00:34:36,460
We don't have any evidence
to support that.

00:34:36,527 --> 00:34:37,628
Run the timeline.

00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:42,900
Couple got home
around 10:00 p.m.

00:34:42,966 --> 00:34:44,635
They went outside
and had some tequila.

00:34:44,701 --> 00:34:46,036
At 10:08,
Ray's daughter

00:34:46,103 --> 00:34:48,438
from his first
marriage phoned.

00:34:48,505 --> 00:34:50,541
Becky went inside
to take the call.

00:34:50,607 --> 00:34:52,676
How long did they talk?

00:34:54,878 --> 00:34:56,480
It's not in Brass' notes.

00:34:56,547 --> 00:34:59,450
Well, I have the phone
records here, so...

00:34:59,516 --> 00:35:02,853
Uh, the call lasted...

00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:05,222
two minutes?!

00:35:05,289 --> 00:35:08,292
I thought the husband told Nick
it was a marathon call.

00:35:08,358 --> 00:35:11,361
Yeah, I'm just seeing this
for the first time here. Um...

00:35:11,428 --> 00:35:15,566
The incoming call did not come
from the grandfather's house.

00:35:15,632 --> 00:35:18,836
I'm gonna
call this number.

Did anybody process
that office phone?

00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:36,286
The office was away
from the crime scene.

00:35:36,353 --> 00:35:40,090
We, uh, checked it
for a murder weapon,

00:35:40,157 --> 00:35:41,358
but that's about it.

00:35:43,293 --> 00:35:45,696

Is everything okay

We have a warrant
to search your house.

00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:28,539
A warrant?! What?

00:36:28,605 --> 00:36:31,375
Would you both please step
outside with this officer?

00:36:31,441 --> 00:36:32,876
Can I get my homework?

00:36:32,943 --> 00:36:34,711
Well, uh...

00:40:01,585 --> 00:40:03,153
Well, he thought
I needed a mom

he stayed with her.

She doesn't seem to blame

So you waited for your

00:41:07,284 --> 00:41:08,485
Are we done here?

00:41:08,552 --> 00:41:10,087
Almost.
We're almost done.

00:41:10,154 --> 00:41:12,089
You know, Susan,
there was a bloody paper towel

00:41:12,156 --> 00:41:13,157
left in the trash.

00:41:13,223 --> 00:41:15,092
Can you tell me about that?

00:41:22,065 --> 00:41:24,334
I put the phone back
in my dad's office

00:41:24,401 --> 00:41:25,702
and I walked back
to Grandpa's.

00:41:25,769 --> 00:41:27,871
Where was your father
when you killed your stepmother?

00:41:28,972 --> 00:41:31,875
He was outside.

00:41:31,942 --> 00:41:33,944
Asleep.

00:41:35,779 --> 00:41:38,348
GRISSOM:
Did you catch that?

00:41:38,415 --> 00:41:40,050
Timeline is off.

00:41:40,117 --> 00:41:44,455
Curious.

00:41:44,521 --> 00:41:45,923
You want to talk
to the dad

00:41:45,989 --> 00:41:48,358
and I'll call the DA?

00:41:48,425 --> 00:41:49,827
Sure.

00:42:02,773 --> 00:42:04,975
You knew.

00:42:05,042 --> 00:42:06,443
What?

00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:09,746
Your daughter killed your wife
and you knew it.

00:42:09,813 --> 00:42:12,883
I don't know what
you're talking about.

00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:16,286
Susan attacked Becky as soon
as she went into the house.

00:42:16,353 --> 00:42:19,089
But you admitted
to having another drink.

00:42:19,156 --> 00:42:20,824
You would've heard the attack.

00:42:20,891 --> 00:42:23,260
I'm sorry, but
that's what happ...

00:42:23,327 --> 00:42:24,828
You went into the house

00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:28,065
and found Susan wiping blood
off of her hands.

00:42:28,132 --> 00:42:31,568
You sent her back
to her grandfather's.

00:42:31,635 --> 00:42:34,538
You came up with a story
to tell the cops,

00:42:34,605 --> 00:42:36,673
and then called 911.

00:42:38,675 --> 00:42:41,512
You were protecting
your daughter.

00:42:41,578 --> 00:42:43,413
And now she's protecting you.

00:42:46,049 --> 00:42:47,384
You can't prove it.

00:42:51,321 --> 00:42:55,238
Well, either way,
you have to live with it.
