( <i>thunder rumbling</i> )

00:00:07,003 --> 00:00:08,471
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

00:00:13,667 --> 00:00:15,417
MAN:
LVPD. Officer Mularz.

00:00:15,417 --> 00:00:17,252
May I help you?

00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,422
Is there somebody there?

00:00:20,488 --> 00:00:24,917
( <i>whispering</i> ):
I'd like to report
a murder.

00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:27,095
Your name?

00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:29,208
Hello?

00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:30,899
Is there somebody there?

00:00:30,965 --> 00:00:41,375
The body can be found
at 1812 White Oak Road.

00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:44,875
I'd like to help you.
Please identify yourself.

00:00:47,082 --> 00:00:51,252
Send someone
to pick up the body.

00:00:51,319 --> 00:00:53,521
( <i>indistinct</i>
<i>radio transmission</i> )

00:01:02,959 --> 00:01:05,633
BRASS:
So an anonymous call
came into metro

00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,002
about an hour ago.

00:01:07,068 --> 00:01:08,003
Investigating officer

00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:09,437
found the dead body.

00:01:09,504 --> 00:01:10,538
The coroner's inside.

00:01:12,707 --> 00:01:15,010
The, uh... the door
was open.

00:01:15,076 --> 00:01:17,245
Unlocked.

00:01:18,947 --> 00:01:21,182
So the house is owned
by the decedent,

00:01:21,249 --> 00:01:23,051
Hayden Bradford.

00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:26,521
Neighbor says he lives alone.

00:01:26,588 --> 00:01:29,391
The floor is covered
in hair.

00:01:29,457 --> 00:01:31,493
Has he got a cat
or a dog?

00:01:31,559 --> 00:01:32,961
Nope.

00:01:33,028 --> 00:01:35,296
But as you
can see

00:01:35,363 --> 00:01:36,998
our dead guy is...

00:01:37,065 --> 00:01:39,167
I guess you could say
he's hirsute.

00:01:39,234 --> 00:01:41,636
"Hirsute" is
an understatement.

00:01:41,703 --> 00:01:43,071
It's like
he's wearing a pelt.

00:01:53,248 --> 00:01:55,850
( <i>cell phone buzzing</i> )

00:02:01,756 --> 00:02:02,824
Hey, David,

00:02:02,891 --> 00:02:04,159
would you
grab that?

00:02:04,225 --> 00:02:07,329
( <i>buzzing continues</i> )

00:02:10,265 --> 00:02:11,733
Thanks.

00:02:13,935 --> 00:02:16,838
A missed call
from a Michelle.

00:02:16,905 --> 00:02:18,773
She called six times

00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,109
since 3:53 p.m.

00:02:21,176 --> 00:02:23,578
Liver temp's 80 degrees.

00:02:23,645 --> 00:02:25,046
Been dead around 12 hours.

00:02:25,113 --> 00:02:27,349
Which makes T.O.D.
around 3:00 p.m.

00:02:27,415 --> 00:02:30,385
PHILLIPS:
Explains why he didn't
take her calls.

00:02:30,452 --> 00:02:31,686
C.O.D.--

00:02:31,753 --> 00:02:34,422
bullet to the chest.

00:02:36,591 --> 00:02:39,294
These strands are smooth,
not coarse.

00:02:39,361 --> 00:02:40,795
They're human.

00:02:40,862 --> 00:02:42,364
Are the roots intact?

00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:43,999
Yeah.

00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:48,269

Hey, Dave, James.

00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:35,648
Hey, Dave, you've got
to pick it up.

00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:38,318
Lift with the knees, Super Dave,
lift with the knees.
Yeah.

00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,153
Thanks, I...
have done this before.

00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:44,624
SIDLE:
Hey.

00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:47,026
WILLOWS:
So, Brass gave us
a quick briefing.

00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:48,027
How can we help?

00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:49,595
Warrick and I are processing

00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:50,797
the interior, room to room.

00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:52,832
So that leaves the perimeter.

00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,167
Thanks.

00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:05,011
Well, this victim definitely had
a lady in his life.

00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,679
That's odd.

00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:09,148
There is not a single
feminine touch

00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:10,950
in this house.

00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:18,291
Michelle.

00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,126
Christmas, 2004.

00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:21,461
It's got to be the same Michelle

00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:23,663
that tried to reach him
six times on his cell phone.

00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:42,548
Broken window.

00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:50,890
Yeah.

00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,458
It slides.

00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:55,094
The front door was locked.

00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:56,596
The killer probably broke
the window

00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:57,997
and exited out the front.

00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:01,868
I'll need to print
the window, but, uh...

00:05:01,935 --> 00:05:03,670
why don't we get
to this first.

00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:08,308
Doesn't look big enough
to have done the job.

00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,394
We have a print.

00:05:57,924 --> 00:05:59,692
"Hey, Jackass--

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,461
"this is your last chance.

00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,596
Pay your debt or I'll hunt
you down."

00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:09,269
Makes our job easier when
the suspect prints
out his motive.

00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:14,040
He has an e-mail printout
from CasinoDan@gmail.com

00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:18,778
<i>to Misterbradford@gmail.com.</i>

00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:22,949
Well, that ain't
no anthill.

00:06:23,016 --> 00:06:24,784
That dirt's fresh.

00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:28,187
Looks like something's
buried there.

00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:41,467
Oh, my God...!

00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:42,735
.32 Beretta.

00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:44,604
Victim was shot, right?

00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:46,372
It's going to be hard
to get a print,

00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:47,974
but I'll get it
to ballistics.

00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,779
GRISSOM:
Well, we knew
he was hairy.

00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:54,647
I didn't realize
the full extent.

00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:56,349
ROBBINS:
Hypertrichosis.

00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,484
I've only read about it.

00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:00,086
Excessive hair growth.

00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:02,121
Genetic.
Extremely rare.

00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:04,757
His case was relatively mild.

00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:06,793
In some individuals, hair grows
everywhere

00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:08,127
except the eyes and the mouth.

00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:09,996
The human werewolf syndrome.

00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:11,464
In Mexico, there's a family

00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:14,033
30 members
are afflicted.

00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,902
Two of the teen boys were
recently adopted

00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:17,437
by the national circus.

00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:20,873
Great. The bearded lady,
the dog-faced boy--

00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,010
Physical deformities
as family entertainment.

00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:25,745
I cleared a path
for the bullet.

00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:31,517
I figured

00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:34,887
you'd want to get this
to ballistics ASAP.

00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:35,888
Thanks, Al.

00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,056
You know, Gil,

00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,158
we're all intrigued
by our nightmares,

00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:40,393
and when we watch freak shows,

00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,128
basically we're all thinking
the same thing.

00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:45,465
Yeah, I'm glad they're not
looking at me.

00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:47,367
Hey, Archie.
Hey.

00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:49,002
Please tell me you've
I.D.'d Casino Dan.

00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:51,204
Yep. The ISP provider

00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:52,905
sent over the subscriber
information

00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:56,376
for a CasinoDan@gmail.com.

00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:57,877
It's registered to a Dan Nobler,

00:07:57,944 --> 00:07:59,312
who runs
a gambling Web site.

00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:02,815
SANDERS:
If I wanted to visit Dan in
person, where would I go?

00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:06,185
Well, the server for
CasinoDan.com is in Argentina,

00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:08,388
which allows him to skirt
U.S. gaming laws.

00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:11,758
However, he's got a Nevada
business license.

00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,426
And I have the address.

00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,430
Anything else I should know?

00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,632
Uh, well, I don't know
if it's relevant,

00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:21,534
but he recently opened
an account

00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:23,002
with Peopledectors.com.

00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:24,938
Who was he looking for?
I don't know.

00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,205
I'll triage
the computer's hard drive.

00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:27,874
<i>Reconstruct</i>
<i>the deleted e-mails.</i>

00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:30,343
<i>I'll get back to you on that.</i>

00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:33,680
Can I help you?

00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:35,381
You Dan Nobler?

00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:36,482
Yeah.

00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:38,117
We're from
the crime lab.

00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,752
We need to ask you
a few questions.

00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:41,287
Look, if you're here
about my business,

00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,789
you can save it
for my attorney.

00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:45,792
No, actually we're
inquiring about a
Mr. Hayden Bradford.

00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,093
You sent him

00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,562
some threatening
e-mails.

00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:51,731
Bradford is a lying
son of a bitch.

00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:53,266
Care to elaborate
on that?

00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:54,901
I run an online
gambling business.

00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:57,036
Bradford had an account,
ran up $10,000 in debt

00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:58,204
and refused to pay.

00:08:58,271 --> 00:08:59,739
Isn't it true in
online gambling

00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:01,207
you have to submit
your credit card,

00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:03,743
prior to gambling,
to insure your losses?

00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,211
That's true.

00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:07,080
And when Bradford was winning,
it wasn't a problem.

00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:09,916
But when his luck changed,
he called his credit card holder

00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:11,584
and said the charges
were fraudulent.

00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:13,453
The credit card company
issued a charge back

00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,754
and I got screwed.

00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:16,456
Is that when you decided
to hunt him down?

00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:21,394
Look, I wrote him an e-mail
hoping to scare him.

00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:24,464
Sorry. I was angry.

00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:27,433
If I write an apology,
can we drop this?

00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,702
No, Mr. Nobler, I'm sorry,
we can't do that.

00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:31,471
Mr. Bradford's dead.

00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:37,977
Any other questions,
contact my lawyer.

00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:39,312
We're done here.

00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:46,352
You see that?

00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,121
Yeah, the guy's a jerk.

00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:51,591
No, he wiped
his feet on the mat.

00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,397
I'm hoping to get a little
trace evidence here.

00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:01,267
Yeah, you see these pebbles?

00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,069
They look like the same ones
that were found

00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:04,304
at the crime scene.

00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:22,255
Fire in the hole!

00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:50,850
Bobby.

00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:51,918
Hey.

00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:55,054
So, that, uh, buried gun
y'all recovered,

00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:57,924
wasn't used
to kill Bradford.

00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:01,561
WILLOWS:
GRCs aren't even close.

00:11:01,628 --> 00:11:03,730
Most bullets are copper,

00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:06,899
but take a look
at the fatal bullet.

00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:09,269
It's silver.

00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:14,040
How do you kill a werewolf?

00:11:18,667 --> 00:11:20,769
( <i>knocking on door</i> )

00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:22,643
No one's home.

00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:24,312
We want to see the wolfman.

00:11:24,378 --> 00:11:25,746
Yeah, well, he's not
available right now.

00:11:25,813 --> 00:11:26,747
I am trying

00:11:26,814 --> 00:11:29,684
to prep him
for autopsy.
Wow.

00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,419
And I thought Robin Williams
had hairy arms.

00:11:31,485 --> 00:11:32,453
Can I touch him?

00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,487
You mean "pet" him.

00:11:33,554 --> 00:11:34,322
No!

00:11:34,388 --> 00:11:36,190
You may not touch
or pet the decedent.

00:11:36,257 --> 00:11:38,125
Is it soft like fur or...?

00:11:38,192 --> 00:11:40,127
I was supposed to have
him prepped hours ago.

00:11:40,194 --> 00:11:41,662
Please.
Okay, you guys gotta go.

00:11:41,729 --> 00:11:43,064
Relax, Dave.
It's not every day

00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:44,499
that Chaka ends up
on a slab.

00:11:44,565 --> 00:11:45,800
Yeah, I need you to leave.

00:11:45,867 --> 00:11:46,701
Whoa.

00:11:46,767 --> 00:11:48,769
Fine, but if I get

00:11:48,836 --> 00:11:51,172
a sleestak in my lab,
and you want to see it,

00:11:51,239 --> 00:11:52,406
I'm gonna get cranky.

00:11:52,473 --> 00:11:54,876
Mr. Moyer, you're here
about Hayden Bradford.

00:11:54,942 --> 00:11:56,110
Do you know him?

00:11:56,177 --> 00:11:58,112
Of course.

00:11:58,179 --> 00:11:59,514
He's one of my closest friends.

00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:02,817
Yeah... Yeah, I'm sorry.
We found his body this morning.

00:12:02,884 --> 00:12:07,121
You didn't recently try
to break in his home...

00:12:07,188 --> 00:12:10,258
did you?

00:12:10,324 --> 00:12:11,392
Excuse me. What?

00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:12,727
We found a rock

00:12:12,793 --> 00:12:14,495
by a broken window,

00:12:14,562 --> 00:12:16,130
With your
fingerprint on it.

00:12:16,197 --> 00:12:17,665
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:12:17,732 --> 00:12:19,066
Is that funny?

00:12:19,133 --> 00:12:20,601
No. It's just. uh...

00:12:20,668 --> 00:12:22,803
last week we were
playing toss with a ball.

00:12:26,207 --> 00:12:28,743
That still doesn't explain to me
how your fingerprint got there.

00:12:30,011 --> 00:12:30,978
<i>There was glass everywhere,</i>

00:12:31,045 --> 00:12:33,481
<i>so I knocked out</i>
<i>the loose pieces.</i>

00:12:33,548 --> 00:12:35,349
You guys being good friends...

00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:38,152
you were aware of his
medical condition, right?

00:12:38,219 --> 00:12:40,421
That he was a hairy S.O.B.?

00:12:40,488 --> 00:12:43,624
Yeah. Of course. Why?

00:12:43,691 --> 00:12:45,393
Do you know why anybody'd
want to hurt him?

00:12:45,459 --> 00:12:48,563
He's a friendly, quiet guy.

00:12:48,629 --> 00:12:50,164
I've known him
since high school.

00:12:50,231 --> 00:12:51,699
He's been dating my sister.

00:12:55,236 --> 00:12:56,204
Oh, God.

00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:58,906
She doesn't know
yet, does she?

00:12:58,973 --> 00:13:00,508
Who, Michelle?

00:13:00,575 --> 00:13:02,577
Yeah.

00:13:02,643 --> 00:13:05,146
I tried to call
her cell phone and...

00:13:05,213 --> 00:13:07,148
She's at my parents,
in Pahrump.

00:13:07,215 --> 00:13:09,016
Her cell's probably
out of range.

00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:13,454
But you can get me their home
number, address, all that?

00:13:13,521 --> 00:13:14,755
Sure.

00:13:14,822 --> 00:13:17,258
But if it's okay, I'd...

00:13:17,325 --> 00:13:20,161
I should break the news
to her in person.

00:13:20,228 --> 00:13:22,964
I've been waiting for you.

00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:25,800
Sorry. I headed out
as soon as I got your page.

00:13:25,867 --> 00:13:28,503
Really? 'Cause, uh...

00:13:28,569 --> 00:13:31,138
I left a voicemail
several hours ago.

00:13:31,205 --> 00:13:32,273
What's up?

00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,942
The anonymous call
was traced to this phone booth,

00:13:35,009 --> 00:13:37,512
so I figured
you'd want to process.

00:13:40,014 --> 00:13:43,117
SIDLE:
There is fingerprint
powder on the phone.

00:13:43,184 --> 00:13:44,318
Yeah, I got bored waiting.

00:13:44,385 --> 00:13:46,320
I thought you might
need some help.

00:13:46,387 --> 00:13:47,889
No usable prints,

00:13:47,955 --> 00:13:49,190
but check out the floor.

00:13:53,561 --> 00:13:55,596
SIDLE:
There's a lot of hair.

00:13:55,663 --> 00:13:57,064
Similar to the crime scene.

00:13:57,131 --> 00:14:00,835
The victim was killed 12 hours
before this call was made.

00:14:00,902 --> 00:14:02,403
If that's his hair,

00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,205
what's it doing here?

00:14:06,307 --> 00:14:07,475
The hair isn't Hayden's.

00:14:07,542 --> 00:14:09,343
The chromosomes are XX.

00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:10,378
Female.
Yeah.

00:14:10,444 --> 00:14:11,479
So I took the liberty

00:14:11,546 --> 00:14:12,914
of comparing the
sample's DNA

00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:13,915
to the victim's DNA.

00:14:13,981 --> 00:14:16,250
There are seven alleles
in common.

00:14:16,317 --> 00:14:17,618
Brother and sister.

00:14:17,685 --> 00:14:18,553
Mm-hmm.

00:14:18,619 --> 00:14:20,755
She's likely our
anonymous caller.

00:14:20,821 --> 00:14:23,524
Yeah, well, given the amount
of hair that you collected,

00:14:23,591 --> 00:14:25,793
she's also probably
a very hairy woman.

00:14:27,728 --> 00:14:29,430
Wendy, can you
do me a favor?
Hmm?

00:14:29,497 --> 00:14:32,900
Can you see if any of the
follicles from the crime scene

00:14:32,967 --> 00:14:35,236
are a match to the hairs
from the phone booth?

00:14:35,303 --> 00:14:37,972
You want to see if the sister
was in the victim's house.

00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:40,942
If she was,
she's not just the caller,

00:14:41,008 --> 00:14:42,944
she's a suspect.

00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:44,645
I hear the vic
has a sister.

00:14:44,712 --> 00:14:46,280
A twin sister, in fact.

00:14:46,347 --> 00:14:48,049
I tracked down the victim's
birth certificate.

00:14:48,115 --> 00:14:50,952
He was born to a Rita Bradford
in Fresno, California.

00:14:51,018 --> 00:14:52,954
Ms. Bradford
apparently had twins,

00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,522
Hayden and Allison.

00:14:54,589 --> 00:14:56,224
There's no record
of any other children.

00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:58,025
I'm assuming you
contacted Allison.

00:14:58,092 --> 00:14:59,327
Well, that's where
it gets odd.

00:14:59,393 --> 00:15:02,029
Allison Bradford has never
filed with the IRS,

00:15:02,096 --> 00:15:03,464
has never had
a driver's license,

00:15:03,531 --> 00:15:04,799
has never filled out a W-2.

00:15:04,866 --> 00:15:07,001
How do you go through life
without a paper trail?

00:15:07,068 --> 00:15:08,002
She's dead.

00:15:08,069 --> 00:15:10,037
There's no record
of a death certificate.

00:15:10,104 --> 00:15:13,207
We found her hair
in the phone booth.

00:15:13,274 --> 00:15:14,442
And DNA just confirmed

00:15:14,509 --> 00:15:16,577
that some of the hair
follicles that we collected

00:15:16,644 --> 00:15:18,379
at the crime scene
are hers.

00:15:18,446 --> 00:15:20,248
Well, other than hair,

00:15:20,314 --> 00:15:21,916
when you and Warrick
processed the house,

00:15:21,983 --> 00:15:23,584
did you find any
evidence of a sister?

00:15:23,651 --> 00:15:26,521
No, but we were
not looking for one.

00:15:26,587 --> 00:15:27,955

00:19:40,341 --> 00:19:44,812
I waited till
midnight, and then

00:19:44,879 --> 00:19:48,449
I walked to a pay phone.

00:19:48,516 --> 00:19:51,252

Did you know the word "werewolf"

00:20:44,613 --> 00:20:47,216
was derived
from the Old English word

00:20:47,282 --> 00:20:51,220
"wargwolf," which is
a synonym for "serial killer"?

00:20:51,286 --> 00:20:52,921
No, I didn't.

00:20:52,988 --> 00:20:57,826
Imagine if you had
some deep, dark secret...

00:20:57,893 --> 00:20:59,962

of being able to hide it away,

I want to talk to her.

00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:54,550
Find out why a mother
would play dead.

00:21:54,616 --> 00:21:56,618
Oh, good,
you're here.

00:21:56,685 --> 00:21:57,819
I love an audience.

00:21:57,886 --> 00:21:59,488
Well, don't expect
any applause.

00:22:00,389 --> 00:22:02,157
What do you got?

00:22:02,224 --> 00:22:04,259
I compared pebbles
from the crime scene

00:22:04,326 --> 00:22:06,995
to the pebbles
from Dan Nobler's doormat.

00:22:07,062 --> 00:22:08,096
They're consistent
with each other--

00:22:08,163 --> 00:22:10,299
a composite commonly known
as pea gravel.

00:22:10,365 --> 00:22:12,801
The pebbles weren't
the only trace elements

00:22:12,868 --> 00:22:14,469
I found
in that doormat.

00:22:14,536 --> 00:22:15,771
I also found several

00:22:15,838 --> 00:22:17,239
slivers of glass...

00:22:17,306 --> 00:22:20,309
glass consistent
with a broken window.

00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:22,377
I'm here about pebbles
and glass.

00:22:22,444 --> 00:22:24,012
Come on.

00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:25,514
Look, this is ridiculous.

00:22:25,581 --> 00:22:28,417
I mean, we're talking about
trace evidence on a doormat?

00:22:28,483 --> 00:22:29,852
Come on.

00:22:29,918 --> 00:22:31,486
Besides,
I read the file.

00:22:31,553 --> 00:22:34,556
A guy named Brent Moyer already
admitted to breaking the window.

00:22:34,623 --> 00:22:36,625
WARRICK:
This is true; he did.

00:22:36,692 --> 00:22:38,493
But we believe
that Mr. Nobler here

00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,162
stepped in the
shards of glass.

00:22:40,229 --> 00:22:42,631
Listen, neither the glass
nor the pebbles

00:22:42,698 --> 00:22:43,599
are probative
on their own,

00:22:43,665 --> 00:22:46,602
but together, they put
your client at the crime scene.

00:22:46,668 --> 00:22:50,472
Not to mention,
his threatening e-mail
gives us motive.

00:22:50,539 --> 00:22:52,207
Fine. I was there.
Dan...

00:22:52,274 --> 00:22:54,810
No, look, I get ripped off
by jerks all over the world.

00:22:54,877 --> 00:22:56,178
This guy was a local.

00:22:56,245 --> 00:22:57,479
I knew his address
and, yeah,

00:22:57,546 --> 00:22:58,480
I wanted to shake him down.

00:22:58,547 --> 00:23:01,250
Let him know that by declaring
credit card fraud,

00:23:01,316 --> 00:23:02,818
he was stealing from me.

00:23:02,885 --> 00:23:05,654
Okay, I'm listening.

00:23:05,721 --> 00:23:10,459
A few days ago,
I went over to his house.

00:23:10,526 --> 00:23:11,593
Then I started thinking,

00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,128
"What if this guy's
like twice my size?"

00:23:13,195 --> 00:23:16,899
I figured I should get
a look at him

00:23:16,965 --> 00:23:18,400
before I had
our "conversation,"

00:23:18,467 --> 00:23:19,868
so I went around back...

00:23:22,771 --> 00:23:24,706

Hey, hey!

00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:38,120
At first, I thought
he was wearing a costume,

00:23:38,187 --> 00:23:43,625
but then I realized, it was...
it was real hair.

00:23:43,692 --> 00:23:44,893
Disgusting, right?

00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,696
What happened next?

00:23:47,763 --> 00:23:49,731
Well, when the dude saw me,
I took off.

00:23:49,798 --> 00:23:51,099
Why?

00:23:51,166 --> 00:23:55,604
Uh, he was a freak of nature.

00:23:55,671 --> 00:23:58,874
I no longer wish
to speak with him.

00:24:09,384 --> 00:24:13,155

Hey, man.

00:24:58,333 --> 00:24:59,668
Hey.

00:24:59,735 --> 00:25:01,170
What are you smiling about?

00:25:01,236 --> 00:25:03,005
Oh, I was just thinking
of <i>The Howling II;</i>

00:25:03,071 --> 00:25:05,274
the werewolf bitch.

00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,375
I don't care what anyone says.

00:25:06,441 --> 00:25:07,809
It was much better
than the first one.

00:25:07,876 --> 00:25:09,278
Is it?
Yeah, yeah.

00:25:09,344 --> 00:25:10,379
I got the whole
anthology.

00:25:10,445 --> 00:25:11,513
Want to borrow it?

00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:15,017
No, thanks. I would like to know
about my bullet, however.

00:25:15,083 --> 00:25:16,952
I assume it was homemade
since the manufacturer

00:25:17,019 --> 00:25:18,020
doesn't sell it in silver.

00:25:18,086 --> 00:25:19,888
Right.
Simple clamshell mold.

00:25:25,194 --> 00:25:27,596
92.5% pure with trace amounts
of copper,

00:25:27,663 --> 00:25:29,932
nickel and chromium lead.

00:25:29,998 --> 00:25:31,500
Elemental properties
are consistent with

00:25:31,567 --> 00:25:33,335
sterling silver jewelry.

00:25:33,402 --> 00:25:36,271
And sterling silver
has a high melting point.

00:25:36,338 --> 00:25:38,373
Someone went through a lot
of trouble to make it.

00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,276
Sorry I didn't get here sooner.

00:25:41,343 --> 00:25:43,545
I was pretty upset.

00:25:43,612 --> 00:25:47,449
Michelle, your relationship
with Hayden, was it serious?

00:25:47,516 --> 00:25:50,052
We were engaged.

00:25:50,118 --> 00:25:52,221
I can't believe he's gone.

00:25:52,287 --> 00:25:56,859
The day he died,
you called him six times.

00:25:56,925 --> 00:26:00,329
There was a golf tournament
on ESPN that night.

00:26:00,395 --> 00:26:01,330
He wanted me

00:26:01,396 --> 00:26:03,432
to tape it for him.

00:26:03,499 --> 00:26:04,733
I was trying to reach him

00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,035
because I was at my folks' place

00:26:07,102 --> 00:26:10,539
and the VCR was broken.

00:26:10,606 --> 00:26:14,610
Sounds so silly now.

00:26:14,676 --> 00:26:19,882
I'd like to see him...
to say good-bye.

00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:24,720
He's with the coroner.

00:26:27,389 --> 00:26:30,192
Michelle, I understand
that you were at your folks

00:26:30,259 --> 00:26:33,695
and you were trying
to get ahold of Hayden
on your cell,

00:26:33,762 --> 00:26:35,864
but we were unable
to reach you on it.

00:26:35,931 --> 00:26:36,932
Can you explain?

00:26:36,999 --> 00:26:40,802
I called Hayden so many times
that my battery died.

00:26:40,869 --> 00:26:42,171
I'm sorry.

00:26:42,237 --> 00:26:44,540
Do you have any idea
who could have done this?

00:26:46,942 --> 00:26:49,678
You know about his condition,
right?

00:26:49,745 --> 00:26:53,048
It made him
really sweet.

00:26:53,115 --> 00:26:56,752
I mean, it was like he was
constantly trying to make up

00:26:56,818 --> 00:27:00,756
for his physical imperfections
by doing everything perfectly.

00:27:00,822 --> 00:27:04,893
He was the perfect
boyfriend,

00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,229
the perfect lover,

00:27:07,296 --> 00:27:09,631
my best friend.

00:27:11,066 --> 00:27:15,270
I don't know what
I'm going to do without him.

00:27:18,473 --> 00:27:22,444
WOMAN:
I was in labor for 27 hours.

00:27:23,979 --> 00:27:26,648
They didn't want to come out.

00:27:26,715 --> 00:27:28,083
Who could blame 'em.

00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:30,819
Mrs. Bradford, why does Allison
think you're dead?

00:27:30,886 --> 00:27:33,555
I thought
it would be easier.

00:27:33,622 --> 00:27:36,558
Easier than what?

00:27:36,625 --> 00:27:40,262
I did the best
I could, Mr. Grissom.

00:27:40,329 --> 00:27:43,165
Their father couldn't
look at 'em.

00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:45,100
Took off when
they were a few weeks old.

00:27:45,167 --> 00:27:47,636
Babies are supposed to be cute.

00:27:49,671 --> 00:27:53,408
Mrs. Bradford...?

00:27:53,475 --> 00:27:57,513
At the time, we were living
in Fresno.

00:27:57,579 --> 00:28:00,582
Family, friends stopped
visiting.

00:28:00,649 --> 00:28:02,384
They were scared of my children.

00:28:02,451 --> 00:28:05,554
Especially Allison.
She... she looked like...

00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:10,959
When she started nursery school,
the kids teased her,

00:28:11,026 --> 00:28:13,328
called her names, made her cry.

00:28:13,395 --> 00:28:17,966
So you moved to Vegas and
decided to keep her a secret?

00:28:18,033 --> 00:28:21,270
It was best for everyone.

00:28:21,336 --> 00:28:25,040
But she became completely
dependent on me,

00:28:25,107 --> 00:28:28,844
and for 18 years,
I took care of her.

00:28:28,911 --> 00:28:30,792
I'm sorry, but I still
don't understand

00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:32,059
why she believes you're dead.

00:28:32,126 --> 00:28:39,634
One day, Allison wanted to take
a walk... outside.

00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:42,403
I didn't want anyone to see her.

00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:47,708
We had a fight.
I locked her in her room--

00:28:47,775 --> 00:28:52,547
my own child-- because
she wanted fresh air.

00:28:55,249 --> 00:28:56,584
At that moment,
I knew I needed

00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:58,953
to leave.

00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:02,523
I told Hayden to tell her I was
in a car accident.

00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:04,859
Two days later, he put on
a black suit,

00:29:04,926 --> 00:29:06,861
told her he was going
to my funeral.

00:29:06,928 --> 00:29:10,832
And she didn't go because
she couldn't leave the house.

00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:18,005
You thought it would be easier
for her to accept your death

00:29:18,072 --> 00:29:19,841
than your abandonment?

00:29:19,907 --> 00:29:23,144
Please don't judge me.

00:29:23,211 --> 00:29:25,513
I spend enough time
doing that.

00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:28,549
I'm just trying to find out
who killed your son.

00:29:30,585 --> 00:29:33,254
I haven't seen either of them
for seven years.

00:29:33,321 --> 00:29:35,456
I wouldn't have any idea.

00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:41,329
You know, Mrs. Bradford,
your daughter's all alone now.

00:29:41,395 --> 00:29:43,731
It's not too late
for you to go back to her.

00:29:43,798 --> 00:29:47,702
And tell her what?

00:29:47,768 --> 00:29:50,671
That I faked my death
to escape from her?

00:29:53,141 --> 00:29:56,043
How do you say that
to your own flesh and blood?

00:30:05,291 --> 00:30:07,026
What's up with the 911?

00:30:07,093 --> 00:30:09,963
David didn't notice the victim's
lividity at the crime scene

00:30:10,029 --> 00:30:12,499
because it was obscured
by his body hair.

00:30:12,565 --> 00:30:14,634
But when we shaved him...

00:30:14,701 --> 00:30:16,603
Well, check out his left side.

00:30:16,669 --> 00:30:19,005
So it was on his side
where the blood settled.

00:30:19,072 --> 00:30:22,709
Correct,
but he was found faceup.

00:30:28,214 --> 00:30:31,484
So, uh, somebody moved him
several hours postmortem.

00:30:31,551 --> 00:30:32,852
There's more.

00:30:32,919 --> 00:30:35,121
Vic was found
on a hardwood floor,

00:30:35,188 --> 00:30:38,258
but when David brushed
his body hair for trace,

00:30:38,324 --> 00:30:40,360
he found blue carpet fibers.

00:30:43,029 --> 00:30:46,699
Well, there was blue carpet
in the sister's room.

00:30:50,937 --> 00:30:52,705
Hayden was shot
through the chest,

00:30:52,772 --> 00:30:55,442
it would have exsanguinated
on impact.

00:30:55,508 --> 00:30:57,544
Any blood in the sister's room?

00:30:57,610 --> 00:31:00,847
I'll get back to you
on that one.

Did Michelle
know about you?

00:34:14,607 --> 00:34:18,044
No, but he said that
he was going to tell her

00:34:18,111 --> 00:34:20,547

going to move in here

00:34:20,613 --> 00:34:22,882

if you didn't kill him,
who did?

00:34:32,525 --> 00:34:33,626
Okay, I'm sorry.

00:34:33,693 --> 00:34:35,795
We can do this here
or we can take this downtown.

00:34:35,862 --> 00:34:37,097
No, please.

00:34:37,163 --> 00:34:39,265
Please.

00:34:39,332 --> 00:34:41,267
I know that you're scared...

00:34:41,334 --> 00:34:44,738
but you have got
to tell us what happened.

00:34:46,506 --> 00:34:48,908
The doorbell rang.

00:34:48,975 --> 00:34:50,443
I went into my room.

00:34:51,644 --> 00:34:52,912
Allison,
where's the gun?

00:34:52,979 --> 00:34:54,114
I... I...

00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:55,582
Damn it, Allison,
where's the gun?

00:34:55,648 --> 00:34:57,584
( <i>gunshot</i> )

00:34:58,952 --> 00:35:00,787
And when he was shot,
what did you do?

00:35:00,854 --> 00:35:02,122
I hid.

00:35:02,188 --> 00:35:04,491
Behind the door.

00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:18,805
Was the television on?

00:35:18,872 --> 00:35:20,874
No.
It's busted.

00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,275
It hasn't worked in years.

00:35:22,342 --> 00:35:25,678
So you had a pretty good view
of the living room

00:35:25,745 --> 00:35:28,181
through the reflection
in the tube.

00:35:28,248 --> 00:35:30,016
What did you see?

00:35:44,764 --> 00:35:47,167
Freak.

00:35:48,902 --> 00:35:51,104
You're sure that it was Brent?

00:35:51,171 --> 00:35:53,273
I've seen him
through the peephole.

00:35:53,339 --> 00:35:54,541
They were best friends.

00:35:54,607 --> 00:35:56,242
Okay, um...

00:35:56,309 --> 00:35:57,811
let's just go back to the gun.

00:35:57,877 --> 00:36:00,046
A couple of days ago,

00:36:00,113 --> 00:36:03,383
Hayden said he saw a guy

00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:04,818
sneaking around the back.

00:36:04,884 --> 00:36:06,886
So he bought me
a gun for safety.

00:36:06,953 --> 00:36:08,722
But I don't like guns

00:36:08,788 --> 00:36:12,492
so... I just buried it
in the backyard.

00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:15,462
Yes, we found it.

00:36:15,528 --> 00:36:16,863
Allison...

00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:20,366
why was it so difficult
for you to tell us the truth?

00:36:20,433 --> 00:36:23,737
I think you're going
to make me testify and I won't

00:36:23,803 --> 00:36:26,072
do that.

00:36:26,139 --> 00:36:31,511
I want Brent to go to jail, but
I won't be the sideshow freak.

00:36:31,578 --> 00:36:36,850
Well, we can try to build
a case without you.

00:36:36,916 --> 00:36:39,519
You can't get a warrant
unless she goes on record.

00:36:39,586 --> 00:36:40,820
Well, just hear me out.

00:36:40,887 --> 00:36:43,356
We have a rock with Brent
Moyer's fingerprints on it.

00:36:43,423 --> 00:36:44,591
Yeah, but Allison told you

00:36:44,657 --> 00:36:46,192
that Brent entered
through the front door.

00:36:46,259 --> 00:36:47,827
The rock is extraneous
evidence, isn't it?

00:36:47,894 --> 00:36:49,729
Well, let's just leave
Allison's testimony out of it.

00:36:49,796 --> 00:36:52,532
We simply inform the judge
that our suspect's fingerprints

00:36:52,599 --> 00:36:55,402
were on a rock that may have
been used to break a window

00:36:55,468 --> 00:36:56,669
at the murder scene.

00:36:56,736 --> 00:36:58,772
If you have no qualms
about filing the petition,

00:36:58,838 --> 00:36:59,806
then file it.

00:36:59,873 --> 00:37:01,241
Oh, no, I don't
have any qualms.

00:37:01,307 --> 00:37:02,842
It's just that
my moral compass

00:37:02,909 --> 00:37:05,178
doesn't always point in
the same direction as yours.

00:37:05,245 --> 00:37:07,514
So if I tell you not
to file it, you won't?

00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:09,115
I'd take it
under advisement.

00:37:09,182 --> 00:37:10,417
Why, is that what
you're recommending?

00:37:10,483 --> 00:37:12,018
How many times have
we been prevented

00:37:12,085 --> 00:37:12,986
from getting a warrant

00:37:13,053 --> 00:37:14,621
when we knew
we had the right guy?

00:37:14,687 --> 00:37:15,789
Way too many.
Right.

00:37:15,855 --> 00:37:18,458
So rock and roll.

00:37:25,965 --> 00:37:27,100
( <i>knocking on door</i> )

00:37:27,167 --> 00:37:29,636
Las Vegas PD.
We have a search warrant.

00:37:31,304 --> 00:37:32,672
What's going on?

00:37:32,739 --> 00:37:34,207
Please step outside.

00:38:21,688 --> 00:38:24,724
Why would I kill my best friend?

00:38:24,791 --> 00:38:27,560
CURTIS:
That's a very good
question.

00:38:27,627 --> 00:38:29,596
A bullet clamshell

00:38:29,662 --> 00:38:33,466
isn't enough for
the DA to file.

00:38:33,533 --> 00:38:35,835
What am I missing here?

00:38:35,902 --> 00:38:40,173
Our trace lab analyzed the
silver found in the bullet mold.

00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:44,010
It's identical composition
to the bullet in the victim.

00:38:44,077 --> 00:38:47,814
DA says it's a slam dunk.

00:38:47,881 --> 00:38:50,550
Hayden was going to marry
my sister.

00:38:50,617 --> 00:38:51,584
Brent, I recommend that...

00:38:53,486 --> 00:38:56,856
I couldn't let that happen.

00:38:56,923 --> 00:38:58,825
He was diseased.

00:38:58,892 --> 00:39:00,560
Wasn't a problem for me.

00:39:00,627 --> 00:39:02,962
But my sister deserved better.

00:39:03,029 --> 00:39:04,664
So you killed him?

00:39:04,731 --> 00:39:08,234
Did you see his body?

00:39:08,301 --> 00:39:12,472
Hayden was a monster passing
for a Regular Joe.

00:39:12,539 --> 00:39:14,074
My parents blamed me

00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:17,210
for introducing them.

00:39:17,277 --> 00:39:21,614
You know, the werewolf disease,
it's hereditary.

00:39:21,681 --> 00:39:26,352
It means my sister
could've given birth to freaks.

00:39:26,419 --> 00:39:28,188
And the silver bullet?

00:39:28,254 --> 00:39:30,724
Figured it was appropriate.

00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:33,326
So you left your parents',

00:39:33,393 --> 00:39:35,762
you went back
to your place

00:39:35,829 --> 00:39:37,297
to make the bullet

00:39:37,363 --> 00:39:39,365
and then you went over
to Hayden's.

00:39:39,432 --> 00:39:41,434
Yeah.

00:39:41,501 --> 00:39:43,603
So it was premeditated.

00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:45,705
I guess you can forget
heat of the moment

00:39:45,772 --> 00:39:46,740
as a mitigating
factor here.

00:39:46,806 --> 00:39:48,408
I did the right thing.

00:39:48,475 --> 00:39:50,877
My sister's
out there waiting.

00:39:50,944 --> 00:39:53,680
Since I confessed,

00:39:53,747 --> 00:39:56,449
can I at least go out
and talk to her?

00:39:56,516 --> 00:39:57,951
Explain why I did it.

00:39:58,017 --> 00:40:01,154
Why don't I do that for you.

00:40:18,004 --> 00:40:19,739
Ms. Moyer...

00:40:19,806 --> 00:40:23,777
your brother confessed
to killing Hayden.

00:40:31,751 --> 00:40:35,121
After our last conversation,
I checked the TV listings.

00:40:35,188 --> 00:40:37,390
There was no golf
tournament that night.

00:40:37,457 --> 00:40:42,028
I think you were calling
Hayden to warn him about Brent.

00:40:45,799 --> 00:40:49,803
I had just announced our
engagement to my family.

00:40:51,671 --> 00:40:53,606
Brent flipped out.

00:40:53,673 --> 00:40:55,942
I was upset.

00:40:56,009 --> 00:40:59,145
Everyone was yelling at me.

00:40:59,212 --> 00:41:01,481
I went for a long walk
to clear my head.

00:41:01,548 --> 00:41:05,585
And when I got back,
Brent was gone.

00:41:05,652 --> 00:41:06,720
He told my parents

00:41:06,786 --> 00:41:08,488
that he was going to
"speak" with Hayden.

00:41:08,555 --> 00:41:11,024
But you had your doubts.

00:41:11,091 --> 00:41:13,293
My brother has a temper.

00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:17,931
Why didn't you
tell us this before?

00:41:17,997 --> 00:41:23,169
When Brent called and told me
that Hayden was dead,

00:41:23,236 --> 00:41:25,505
he said that if
I told you guys...

00:41:25,572 --> 00:41:27,607
if I implicated him...

00:41:27,674 --> 00:41:28,975
He threatened you.

00:41:37,517 --> 00:41:40,453
It's okay.

00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,655
You're safe now.

00:41:42,722 --> 00:41:44,824
Allison...

00:41:44,891 --> 00:41:46,626
what are you going
to do now?

00:41:46,693 --> 00:41:48,995
I'll be okay.

00:41:49,062 --> 00:41:51,531
It's not like when I was a kid.

00:41:51,598 --> 00:41:54,334
I can pretty much get anything
I need off the internet.

00:41:54,401 --> 00:41:56,102
WILLOWS:
<i>And you're set with money?</i>

00:41:56,169 --> 00:41:58,738
ALLISON:
<i>I'll manage.</i>

00:41:58,805 --> 00:42:02,375
<i>Allison, I have</i>
<i>every confidence</i>

00:42:02,442 --> 00:42:06,479
<i>that you're going to be</i>
<i>just fine here, but...</i>

00:42:06,546 --> 00:42:09,082
if you ever need anything,
would you please give me a call?

00:42:09,149 --> 00:42:11,851
I-I will, Ms. Willows.

00:42:11,918 --> 00:42:13,853
Catherine.

00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,922
Catherine.

00:42:18,058 --> 00:42:20,560
I haven't been completely honest
with you.

00:42:22,996 --> 00:42:24,197
I told you

00:42:24,264 --> 00:42:25,265
my mother was dead,

00:42:25,331 --> 00:42:27,434
but that's not true.

00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,269
I'm not sure I follow.

00:42:29,335 --> 00:42:32,372
Hayden told me she was
in a car wreck

00:42:32,439 --> 00:42:37,911
<i>and I called the funeral home</i>
<i>to send flowers.</i>

00:42:37,977 --> 00:42:39,412
<i>They had never heard of her,</i>

00:42:39,479 --> 00:42:45,018
<i>so I called the local</i>
<i>hospitals, same thing.</i>

00:42:45,085 --> 00:42:50,790
Recently, I contacted
peopledetectors.com

00:42:50,857 --> 00:42:57,430
and, apparently,
she lives in Las Vegas.

00:42:57,497 --> 00:42:59,899
She just couldn't live with me.

00:43:02,602 --> 00:43:06,706
WILLOWS:
<i>So you were the one that</i>
<i>contacted peopledetectors.</i>

00:43:06,773 --> 00:43:08,308
ALLISON:
<i>Yeah.</i>

00:43:08,374 --> 00:43:11,333
<i>When my brother was out,</i>
<i>I used his computer.</i>
