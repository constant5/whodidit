00:09:56,347 --> 00:09:57,581
Want to go?

00:09:57,648 --> 00:09:59,550
Yeah, I'll come with you.

00:09:59,617 --> 00:10:01,785
You sure you can afford
the airfare, darlin'?

00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:02,886
Is two G's enough?

00:10:02,953 --> 00:10:03,887
Where you at?

00:10:03,954 --> 00:10:06,457
3057 Westfall.

00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:08,092
It's right off
of Charleston.

00:10:08,158 --> 00:10:09,426
It's a single
level building,

00:10:09,493 --> 00:10:10,995
all the way
in the back.

00:10:11,061 --> 00:10:12,296
What do you look like?

00:10:12,363 --> 00:10:14,398
Um...

00:10:14,465 --> 00:10:16,900
I have a little
Tom Cruise thing going.

00:10:16,967 --> 00:10:19,069
All right, half an hour,
and I'll be there.

00:10:19,136 --> 00:10:20,271
All right.

00:10:20,337 --> 00:10:21,572
( <i>hangs up</i> )

00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:22,740
Yeah, right.

00:10:22,806 --> 00:10:23,807
Ah, sweet apple pie!

00:10:23,874 --> 00:10:25,276
The Cruiser.

00:10:28,312 --> 00:10:30,681
Calling me to a
crime lab is cute.

00:10:30,748 --> 00:10:32,182
It's still
entrapment.

00:10:32,249 --> 00:10:33,417
( <i>laughs</i> )

00:10:33,484 --> 00:10:35,185
Well, you're not here
about prostitution, sweetie.

00:10:35,252 --> 00:10:36,520
Really?

00:10:36,587 --> 00:10:38,622
No. I need your help
with a homicide.

00:10:38,689 --> 00:10:41,025
Why don't you go ahead
and have a seat?

00:10:41,091 --> 00:10:43,193
Thanks.

00:10:45,396 --> 00:10:47,898
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:10:47,965 --> 00:10:51,702
This man's wife was murdered
last night.

00:10:51,769 --> 00:10:53,103
His name's Willie Cutler.

00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:54,471
Was he ever a client?

00:10:54,538 --> 00:10:56,040
We dated.

00:10:56,106 --> 00:10:57,441
Yeah.

00:10:57,508 --> 00:11:02,413
SALLY:
<i>He was trying to play</i>
<i>the, you know,</i>

00:11:02,479 --> 00:11:03,981
<i>"I'm a big baller" role.</i>

00:11:04,048 --> 00:11:05,916
Do you got a present
for me, baby?

00:11:05,983 --> 00:11:08,419
<i>He must have won</i>
<i>some big jackpot or</i>
<i>something--</i>

00:11:08,485 --> 00:11:10,421
<i>I can tell when money's new.</i>

00:11:10,487 --> 00:11:14,792
<i>He pulled this big wad</i>
<i>out of his Wal-Mart pants.</i>

00:11:17,061 --> 00:11:18,963
<i>But he seemed harmless.</i>

00:11:22,499 --> 00:11:24,902
Kind of sweet,
actually.

00:11:24,969 --> 00:11:26,637
He offered me
a deal on a vacation.

00:11:26,704 --> 00:11:29,540
Deal? What, like
a travel agent?

00:11:29,607 --> 00:11:31,609
I don't know.
I guess.

00:11:31,675 --> 00:11:33,644
He offered me this.

00:11:35,446 --> 00:11:37,314
I've never been
to Hawaii.

00:11:38,382 --> 00:11:40,651
No...

00:11:40,718 --> 00:11:42,820
No, me either.

00:11:47,224 --> 00:11:49,560
I'd let <i>you</i>
take me to Hawaii.

00:11:50,894 --> 00:11:53,297
Yeah, I'm working.

00:11:53,364 --> 00:11:54,598
So am I.

00:12:00,938 --> 00:12:02,039
( <i>laughter</i> )

00:12:02,106 --> 00:12:05,075
WILLOWS:
"Tour historic Las Vegas."

00:12:05,142 --> 00:12:07,177
History in Vegas
gets imploded.

00:12:07,244 --> 00:12:08,846
It's probably just
a drive past the Flamingo

00:12:08,912 --> 00:12:10,447
where Bugsy Siegel
took his leak.

00:12:11,348 --> 00:12:13,017
"Closed"?
Now wait a minute.

00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:14,985
It should be open.

00:12:15,052 --> 00:12:17,021
Well, it looks like it is.

00:12:17,087 --> 00:12:18,622
Oh.

00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:23,961
Hello?

00:12:24,028 --> 00:12:26,263
Anybody here?

00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:28,699
Las Vegas Police.

00:12:28,766 --> 00:12:31,068
Hello?
Catherine.

00:12:40,277 --> 00:12:42,646
( <i>softly</i> ):
Control, this is CSI Willows.

00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:50,454
We have a 419 at 4172 Hamilton.

00:12:50,521 --> 00:12:53,290
A business:
Neon City Excursions.

00:12:53,357 --> 00:12:55,526
Suspect may still
be on the premises.

00:13:20,851 --> 00:13:22,386
( <i>thudding</i> )

00:13:34,932 --> 00:13:36,367
Please! Please don't!

00:13:36,433 --> 00:13:38,202
Don't kill me.
Don't kill me.

00:13:38,269 --> 00:13:39,870
Don't kill me.
Please, don't kill me.

00:13:39,937 --> 00:13:41,505
It's all right, sir.

00:13:41,572 --> 00:13:43,741
We're not going to hurt you;
we're the police.

00:13:47,792 --> 00:13:51,128
( <i>groans</i> )

00:13:51,195 --> 00:13:53,531
( <i>indistinct announcement</i>
<i>over PA</i> )

00:13:55,633 --> 00:13:57,702
Thanks. I'll take that.

00:13:58,333 --> 00:13:59,401
DOCTOR:
All right, bullet wound.

00:13:59,468 --> 00:14:01,303
Let's see what
the paramedics left me.

00:14:02,337 --> 00:14:03,138
( <i>groans</i> )

00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:07,776
Irregular laceration,
subcutaneous tissue only.

00:14:07,843 --> 00:14:09,077
A few millimeters deeper,

00:14:09,144 --> 00:14:11,780
it would have nicked
the intercostal artery.

00:14:11,847 --> 00:14:14,049
That sounds bad.
Yeah. Would've been
a real mess.

00:14:14,116 --> 00:14:15,217
You're a lucky man.

00:14:15,284 --> 00:14:16,852
Flush out the wound,

00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:18,787
dress it with
4 x 4 gauze,

00:14:18,854 --> 00:14:20,956
start an IV,
hang cefazolin

00:14:21,023 --> 00:14:22,791
and get some
blood work done.

00:14:22,858 --> 00:14:25,127
Oh, and get him
a tetanus shot.

00:14:25,194 --> 00:14:29,097
Ah, the warm
fuzzy feeling
of modern medicine.

00:14:29,164 --> 00:14:31,099
Can I get something to wear?

00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:32,601
Uh, yes,
in a few minutes.

00:14:32,668 --> 00:14:34,403
I need to document
your wound.

00:14:34,469 --> 00:14:35,437
Do you think you could

00:14:35,504 --> 00:14:37,105
lift your arms for me
like this?

00:14:38,173 --> 00:14:39,541
Thank you.
That's perfect.

00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:43,679
Why don't you tell us
what happened.

00:14:43,745 --> 00:14:45,447
Um. Not much to tell, really.

00:14:45,514 --> 00:14:47,115
Uh... Cowboy Dan

00:14:47,182 --> 00:14:49,518
had the office
working round the clock

00:14:49,585 --> 00:14:50,853
for the last week.

00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:56,859
We were putting together
a campaign for a new tour.

00:14:56,925 --> 00:14:58,427
I just got back from breakfast.

00:14:58,494 --> 00:15:01,196
<i>I heard a shot, shouting.</i>

00:15:01,263 --> 00:15:02,297
( <i>multiple gunshots</i> )

00:15:02,364 --> 00:15:07,503
( <i>gasping and groaning</i> )

00:15:07,569 --> 00:15:09,638
<i>I guess the guy didn't even</i>
<i>know I was there.</i>

00:15:15,511 --> 00:15:18,647
I was so scared,
I couldn't move.

00:15:18,714 --> 00:15:20,916
So I just played dead.

00:15:23,752 --> 00:15:25,587
Ow.

00:15:25,654 --> 00:15:29,424
I don't even know
how long I was there.

00:15:29,491 --> 00:15:30,659
And then you guys came in

00:15:30,726 --> 00:15:32,461
and found me.

00:15:32,528 --> 00:15:35,664
Do you think that
you could indicate
on this diagram

00:15:35,731 --> 00:15:37,966
where you were standing
when you were shot?

00:15:38,033 --> 00:15:40,636
Um...

00:15:40,702 --> 00:15:44,139
I guess I was standing
somewhere around here.

00:15:44,206 --> 00:15:45,574
Thank you.

00:15:45,641 --> 00:15:47,309
Look, I really need
to call my wife.

00:15:47,376 --> 00:15:48,744
I should have been home
by now,

00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:50,312
and she's probably worried.

00:15:50,379 --> 00:15:51,813
VARTANN:
Um.... Mr. Cutler,

00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,415
when was the last time
you were home?

00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:56,485
Um...

00:15:56,552 --> 00:15:59,755
I guess it was, uh...

00:15:59,821 --> 00:16:01,723
probably yesterday morning.

00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:02,925
Why?

00:16:04,126 --> 00:16:05,794
Mr. Cutler.

00:16:05,861 --> 00:16:09,398
I am very sorry,
but... your wife is dead.

00:16:09,464 --> 00:16:11,233
She was found shot

00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,202
last night in your home.

00:16:15,204 --> 00:16:17,372
Wh...?

00:16:29,351 --> 00:16:31,587
( <i>camera shutter clicking</i> )

00:16:37,659 --> 00:16:39,795
Single GSW
to the forehead.

00:16:42,197 --> 00:16:44,666
Stipling makes it
close range.

00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:48,103
At least he died
with his boots on.

00:16:49,705 --> 00:16:51,406
( <i>single gunshot</i> )

00:16:51,473 --> 00:16:52,774
<i>WILLOWS:</i>
<i>Cowboy Dan gets it first.</i>

00:16:52,841 --> 00:16:55,043
<i>The shooter finds</i>
<i>his next target.</i>

00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,712
( <i>four gunshots; man groans</i> )

00:16:56,778 --> 00:16:58,514
<i>Shoots him in the back.</i>

00:17:04,353 --> 00:17:05,787
SANDERS:
That's the vic's desk.

00:17:05,854 --> 00:17:07,789
He was getting
a promotion.

00:17:07,856 --> 00:17:09,057
Well, at least his day

00:17:09,124 --> 00:17:10,592
started out
on a good note.

00:17:10,659 --> 00:17:12,628
Looks like the gun's
been wiped clean.

00:17:12,694 --> 00:17:14,263
Doubt we'll
get any prints.
So what do you got,

00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:16,798
five nine-mil
shell casings?

00:17:16,865 --> 00:17:18,300
Two went back with the body,

00:17:18,367 --> 00:17:20,068
three... still in the walls.

00:17:20,135 --> 00:17:22,104
So they're all accounted for.

00:17:33,148 --> 00:17:37,419
So Willie Cutler must have been
standing along this line

00:17:37,486 --> 00:17:38,854
when he was grazed
by the bullet.

00:17:38,921 --> 00:17:39,922
Looks about right.

00:17:39,988 --> 00:17:41,757
It's consistent
with his statement.

00:17:44,426 --> 00:17:46,528
( <i>camera shutter clicks</i> )

00:17:46,595 --> 00:17:48,397
And if the shooter
never saw him,

00:17:48,463 --> 00:17:50,632
he got under the desk
really quickly.

00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,936
I sure would have.

00:17:54,002 --> 00:17:55,604
So what do you think, Greg?

00:17:55,671 --> 00:17:58,607
Is Willie Cutler
the luckiest guy in the world

00:17:58,674 --> 00:17:59,708
or the unluckiest?

00:17:59,775 --> 00:18:01,777
I wouldn't want his luck
either way.

00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:09,117
BRASS:
Geez, you lose your wife,
your boss, your co-worker,

00:18:09,184 --> 00:18:12,521
all in 24 hours;
that's rough.

00:18:12,588 --> 00:18:15,324
My heart goes
out to you, pal.

00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:16,325
Really.

00:18:16,391 --> 00:18:17,793
Thank you.

00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:21,029
Looks like someone's
out to get you.

00:18:21,096 --> 00:18:22,364
What do you mean?

00:18:22,431 --> 00:18:25,634
Well, the way I see it,
somebody's out to kill you

00:18:25,701 --> 00:18:27,202
and a lot of innocent people

00:18:27,269 --> 00:18:29,104
are getting
in the way.

00:18:29,171 --> 00:18:31,139
Yeah.

00:18:31,206 --> 00:18:32,641
That's got to be it.

00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:33,709
Yeah.

00:18:35,744 --> 00:18:36,712
Who'd want to kill you?

00:18:36,778 --> 00:18:39,681
I don't know.

00:18:39,748 --> 00:18:41,383
Maybe it's
just some nutcase.

00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:43,519
A guy sees me
on the street,

00:18:43,585 --> 00:18:45,053
and I remind him
of somebody he hates.

00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,256
Yeah, that's...
that's a pretty good theory.

00:18:48,624 --> 00:18:51,360
Want to hear another one?

00:18:51,426 --> 00:18:52,761
Sure.

00:18:54,196 --> 00:18:56,732
Well, this one starts with
your wife banging the lawn boy.

00:18:56,798 --> 00:18:58,734
Hmm?

00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,735
Timmy?

00:18:59,801 --> 00:19:00,936
Timmy.

00:19:02,104 --> 00:19:03,672
What, you didn't know?

00:19:03,739 --> 00:19:05,741
No.
Really?

00:19:05,807 --> 00:19:07,809
'Cause according to Timmy,
you found him in the bedroom

00:19:07,876 --> 00:19:09,444
and you dragged him
out of the closet.

00:19:09,511 --> 00:19:11,079
Well, he's lying.

00:19:11,146 --> 00:19:12,247
'Cause I wasn't home.

00:19:12,314 --> 00:19:15,817
Oh, yeah, that's right.
That's right.

00:19:15,884 --> 00:19:17,953
You were on the love boat
with Sally the hooker.

00:19:21,557 --> 00:19:23,992
Look, my wife and I
had some problems.

00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:25,260
You know, all
married couples do.

00:19:25,327 --> 00:19:26,628
Hey.

00:19:28,564 --> 00:19:32,100
I was getting
a promotion at work.

00:19:32,167 --> 00:19:35,137
At least I thought I was.

00:19:35,204 --> 00:19:37,105
So I threw myself
a little celebration.

00:19:37,172 --> 00:19:39,141
I guess that makes you
a premature celebrator.

00:19:40,943 --> 00:19:43,212
Tell me about that
work-promotion thing.

00:19:43,278 --> 00:19:45,948
Why were you passed up?

00:19:46,014 --> 00:19:48,383
Cowboy Dan just
couldn't bring himself

00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:49,651
to promote a felon.

00:19:49,718 --> 00:19:51,019
Yeah, no, I've-I've
read your record.

00:19:51,086 --> 00:19:52,087
I mean, it's minor league.

00:19:52,154 --> 00:19:56,225
I mean, like,
joyriding at 19.

00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:58,594
Stupid kid stuff.
You know,

00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,762
it follows you around
the rest of your life.

00:20:00,829 --> 00:20:02,297
Oh, believe me, I know.

00:20:02,364 --> 00:20:04,433
Look, here's
what we got here.

00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,801
Cowboy Dan is dead.

00:20:05,868 --> 00:20:08,804
The guy who got your promotion
is dead.

00:20:08,871 --> 00:20:10,038
It seems to me,

00:20:10,105 --> 00:20:13,342
that the one
with the most motive to kill

00:20:13,408 --> 00:20:15,944
in this sad tale... is you.

00:20:17,713 --> 00:20:19,114
I got shot, too.

00:20:19,181 --> 00:20:21,250
Well... you know...

00:20:21,316 --> 00:20:22,251
kinda.

from your
home equity account

00:20:28,056 --> 00:20:29,758
to a marker
at the Lucky Dragon.

00:20:29,825 --> 00:20:30,759
So?

00:20:30,826 --> 00:20:33,095
So, I mean, it wasn't
for Chinese food.

00:20:33,162 --> 00:20:34,796
So maybe you hired
a professional killer

00:20:34,863 --> 00:20:37,499
to hit your wife, your boss,
your coworker.

00:20:37,566 --> 00:20:38,834
That's not true!

to, you know, make you look
nice and innocent, you know?

00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:45,240
I didn't kill my wife!

00:20:46,241 --> 00:20:47,976
I lost this money
at the tables.

00:20:50,546 --> 00:20:52,281
You know...

00:20:52,347 --> 00:20:54,149
This has been
the worst day of my life,

00:20:54,216 --> 00:20:56,318

my wife's body--
I want to leave.

00:20:57,686 --> 00:20:59,855
But we're
not done here, Willie.
We're done!

00:20:59,922 --> 00:21:01,323
You can't prove
that I killed

00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:03,292
anybody
because I didn't kill anybody.

00:21:03,358 --> 00:21:05,460
And if you're not
going to charge me,

00:21:05,527 --> 00:21:06,829
I'm going to leave.

00:21:06,895 --> 00:21:09,531

but there's a lot of
media heat on this one.

00:21:14,603 --> 00:21:15,938
I had to cut him loose.

00:21:16,004 --> 00:21:18,307
Well, he's got a bullet wound
and a dead wife.

00:21:18,373 --> 00:21:20,209
For now, the evidence says
he's a victim.

00:21:20,275 --> 00:21:23,278

Okay.

00:22:36,285 --> 00:22:38,420
So?

00:22:38,487 --> 00:22:40,722
He didn't know
where he wanted to go,

but he said I should drive
anyway, so I drive.

He sees a store,
he says stop. Buys a beer.

00:22:45,994 --> 00:22:48,630
Then he says, drive, stop,
cigarettes, and drive some more.

00:22:48,697 --> 00:22:49,932
I'm all around town.

Yeah. Yeah,
that's what he said.

00:22:56,572 --> 00:22:58,006
He asked me
to wait for him

00:22:58,073 --> 00:22:59,942

I told him, I got to
get home to my wife.

And he asked me,
do I love my wife,

00:23:06,448 --> 00:23:07,716

which I am.

00:23:12,888 --> 00:23:13,989
And he left.

00:23:54,794 --> 00:23:56,863
Sammy did time in Chino
for grand theft auto.

00:23:56,930 --> 00:24:00,100
Willie had a vehicle-related
felony on his record, too.

00:24:00,166 --> 00:24:01,868
Yeah, the same incident.

00:24:01,935 --> 00:24:04,304
See, Willie was a
first-time offender,
so he pled out.

00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:07,440
But Sammy had a record,
so the judge gave
him a hard time.

00:24:07,507 --> 00:24:09,409
So he got in trouble
on the inside.

00:24:09,476 --> 00:24:10,677
He did an
extended sentence.

00:24:10,744 --> 00:24:12,212
He got out six
months ago.

00:24:12,278 --> 00:24:15,448

Sammy goes to prison.

00:24:33,633 --> 00:24:35,301
Sammy gets out,
tries to get even.

00:24:35,368 --> 00:24:36,936
Well, if Sammy was trying
to get even,

00:24:37,003 --> 00:24:38,605
why did Willie keep quiet
about it?

00:24:38,671 --> 00:24:40,006
He's his brother's keeper.

00:24:40,974 --> 00:24:42,542
It's in the Bible.

00:24:45,578 --> 00:24:47,714
This is the man
that we're looking for.

00:24:47,781 --> 00:24:49,616
Please keep your eyes peeled.

00:24:49,682 --> 00:24:51,851
He may have been here
last night.

00:24:51,918 --> 00:24:54,487
I want you to cover
every square inch of this place.

00:24:54,554 --> 00:24:56,222
Let's spread out; let's move it.

00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,829
So, this is Sammy Cutler.

00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:05,432
This is his mug shot.

00:25:05,498 --> 00:25:07,867
It's a few years old,

00:25:07,934 --> 00:25:10,703
and this is
what he looks like now.

00:25:13,406 --> 00:25:16,276
Hey, Sara, you're working
the office shooting, right?

00:25:16,342 --> 00:25:18,011
Yeah,
and the dead wife.

00:25:18,078 --> 00:25:20,380
Autopsy reports
on the two D.B.'s.

00:25:20,447 --> 00:25:23,216
Grissom wanted them ASAP,
and I was in the neighborhood.

00:25:23,283 --> 00:25:25,051
Thanks. I'll pass
them along.

00:25:27,454 --> 00:25:29,022
Somebody at the office
get knifed?

00:25:29,089 --> 00:25:31,157
No.

00:25:31,224 --> 00:25:33,626
Kind of looks like
a knife wound.

00:25:33,693 --> 00:25:34,794
Victim survived
the shooting.

00:25:34,861 --> 00:25:37,464
He said he was grazed
by a stray bullet.

00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:39,532
Really?

00:25:40,867 --> 00:25:44,537
This is an irregular laceration
with no defining features.

00:25:44,604 --> 00:25:47,474
A grazing GSW is usually
accompanied

00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:49,075
by some marginal abrasion.

00:25:49,142 --> 00:25:50,310
There's none here.

00:25:50,376 --> 00:25:52,812
Any idea what might have
caused a wound like this?

00:25:52,879 --> 00:25:54,380
Yeah, lots of things.

00:25:54,447 --> 00:25:55,915
Something sharp.

00:25:57,383 --> 00:25:59,319
Hmm.

00:25:59,385 --> 00:26:02,188
What's this blue discoloration?

00:26:03,923 --> 00:26:06,359
SIDLE:
Kind of looks like ink.

00:26:06,426 --> 00:26:08,027
Doesn't it?

00:26:08,094 --> 00:26:09,863
Mm-hmm.

00:26:14,267 --> 00:26:17,604
Catherine found this
under Willie Cutler's desk.

00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:19,973
Thought the blood
was incidental.

00:26:30,683 --> 00:26:33,753
Sodium rhodizonate is negative.

00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,622
No lead in the tear.

00:26:35,688 --> 00:26:37,390
No bullet.

00:26:37,457 --> 00:26:40,627

like he was shot.

Don't know.

00:26:58,044 --> 00:27:00,613

And what about Sammy?

00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,535
I haven't seen him.

00:37:52,636 --> 00:37:55,405
I tried to find him myself.

00:37:55,472 --> 00:37:58,475
I figured I could get him
to Mexico or something.

00:37:58,542 --> 00:38:01,044
I drove around
for hours.

00:38:01,111 --> 00:38:02,779
Nothing.

00:38:04,648 --> 00:38:07,751
So I went back to my office,

00:38:07,818 --> 00:38:10,454
and that's when I saw Cowboy Dan
and Roger.

00:38:12,256 --> 00:38:13,857
And I knew what Sammy meant

00:38:13,924 --> 00:38:17,161
when he said he was going
to take care of me.

00:38:17,227 --> 00:38:19,830
He was going to give me
a clean slate.

00:38:19,897 --> 00:38:21,698
He was going to kill
everyone that wronged me.

00:38:21,765 --> 00:38:23,100
But she hasn't wronged you.

00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:26,603
Jackie hasn't done
anything to hurt you.

00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,272
So why would you want
to hurt her?

00:38:28,338 --> 00:38:30,607
Let's cut her loose.

00:38:30,674 --> 00:38:32,609
I don't want to hurt anybody.

00:38:32,676 --> 00:38:34,945
That's right, Willie.

00:38:35,012 --> 00:38:36,847
You don't want to hurt anybody.

00:38:36,914 --> 00:38:40,384
You kill somebody,
even by accident,

00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:42,519
you can never
take it back.

00:38:42,586 --> 00:38:45,556
People never look at you
the same way again.

00:38:45,622 --> 00:38:47,824
And you know what?

00:38:47,891 --> 00:38:49,993
You can't look at yourself
the same way again, either.

00:38:51,695 --> 00:38:52,896
( <i>knocking</i> )
SIDLE:
Griss?

00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:53,964
You got to see this.

00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:55,999
I found it on the Internet.

00:39:06,476 --> 00:39:08,145
Me and Sammy?

00:39:08,212 --> 00:39:09,680
( <i>sniffles</i> )

00:39:09,746 --> 00:39:11,415
We used to be so tight.

00:39:11,481 --> 00:39:12,683
Mm.

00:39:12,749 --> 00:39:15,252
And that stupid car.

00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:18,222
He always felt so guilty
about dragging me into that,

00:39:18,288 --> 00:39:19,656
but it wasn't his fault.

00:39:19,723 --> 00:39:20,757
He wasn't to blame.

00:39:20,824 --> 00:39:21,758
Well...

00:39:21,825 --> 00:39:22,926
( <i>cell phone rings</i> )

00:39:22,993 --> 00:39:24,261
Just the phone.
Just the phone.

00:39:24,328 --> 00:39:27,464
( <i>cell phone rings</i> )
Take it easy.

00:39:32,169 --> 00:39:33,103
Yeah.

00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:36,306
Jim? Sammy Cutler's dead.

00:39:36,373 --> 00:39:40,277
He died in a car crash in Mexico
two months ago.

00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:42,045
Willie had to know.

00:39:42,112 --> 00:39:43,046
He's been playing us.

00:39:43,113 --> 00:39:44,815
I got it, yeah. Thanks.

00:39:51,321 --> 00:39:53,624
Hey, Willie.

00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:55,893
Sammy's not coming up.

00:39:57,761 --> 00:39:59,062
But I guess
we both know that, right?

00:40:00,597 --> 00:40:01,999
Yeah.

00:40:04,101 --> 00:40:06,203
It's a good thing
I have the gun.

00:40:13,834 --> 00:40:14,750
Jim.
