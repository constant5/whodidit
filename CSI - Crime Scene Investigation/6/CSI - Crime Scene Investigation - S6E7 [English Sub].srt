00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:21,500
These guys are hard core.

00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,811
Who are they?

00:00:24,212 --> 00:00:26,581
( <i>gunfire continues</i> )

00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:29,810
Tell Control these guys
have automatic weapons!

00:00:29,877 --> 00:00:31,178
Probably A-Ks!

00:00:31,245 --> 00:00:33,113
With me!

00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:34,314
Three-David-34,

00:00:34,381 --> 00:00:36,617

00:00:36,684 --> 00:00:38,052
automatic weapons,

00:00:38,118 --> 00:00:39,453
possibly AK-47s.

00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,921
All right, we're coming up
on a T-intersection.

00:00:40,988 --> 00:00:42,222
Get ready.

OFFICER:
We're going
to get killed!

00:00:51,598 --> 00:00:53,033
Not if you do what
you're supposed to do.

00:00:57,938 --> 00:01:00,808
OFFICER:
Three-David-34,
suspect Caprice has T/C'd.

00:01:00,874 --> 00:01:02,476
Intersection Jefferson
and Third.

00:01:02,543 --> 00:01:04,912
When you get out,
keep your head down.

00:01:55,796 --> 00:01:57,598
They're out of rifle ammo!

00:02:08,876 --> 00:02:10,677
( <i>screaming</i> )

00:02:11,779 --> 00:02:12,713
They're running.

00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,814
I'm going left.
You go right.

00:02:13,881 --> 00:02:15,416
Going to take these guys.
You guys, move on up.

00:02:15,482 --> 00:02:17,718
Three-Boy-Seven in foot pursuit
of two male Latinos.

00:02:17,785 --> 00:02:19,119
One east, one west
on Third Street.

Requesting immediate backup

00:02:28,896 --> 00:02:30,164
and paramedics.

00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:34,001
I'll stay with him.
I'll take care...

00:02:34,068 --> 00:02:35,836
( <i>sirens blaring</i> )

00:02:40,074 --> 00:02:42,142
<i>Que paso?</i>

00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:43,143
<i>Nada.</i>

00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:44,211
<i>Adentro, adentro.</i>

00:02:47,147 --> 00:02:48,282
Cuff him.

00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,755
<i>Dame una ambulancia, puey.</i>

00:02:54,822 --> 00:02:55,989
I don't speak Spanish.

00:03:04,398 --> 00:03:06,500
Back inside,
back inside.

00:03:20,748 --> 00:03:21,482
You okay?

00:03:21,548 --> 00:03:22,716
Yeah. You?

00:03:27,454 --> 00:03:28,889
What are you doing?
Put it down.

00:03:28,956 --> 00:03:30,524
Yeah, sorry.
I was just trying

00:03:30,591 --> 00:03:31,725
to secure his gun.

00:03:31,792 --> 00:03:33,093
He's not going
to use it anymore.

00:03:34,428 --> 00:03:35,629
Stop! Police!

00:03:35,696 --> 00:03:37,498
Stop! Police!
Don't move!

00:03:38,932 --> 00:03:40,734
Don't move!

00:03:42,069 --> 00:03:43,103
( <i>metal clanging</i> )

00:03:55,449 --> 00:03:56,684
SOFIA:
Brass, suspect's in custody.

00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,685
Copy.

00:03:57,751 --> 00:03:59,787
Control, this is Brass.

00:03:59,853 --> 00:04:01,088
Situation here is Code 4.

00:04:01,155 --> 00:04:02,623
We have three suspects
in custody.

00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:04,024
One is on the run.

00:04:06,193 --> 00:04:08,729
You know it's going
to be a long shift

00:04:08,796 --> 00:04:10,831
when you get the
call to respond
to a command post.

00:04:10,898 --> 00:04:12,833
Yeah. Warrick...

00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,535
we need everyone
from Grave.

00:04:14,601 --> 00:04:15,836
But park
on Wall Street.

00:04:15,903 --> 00:04:18,839
Jefferson's taped off
all the way back to Lincoln.

00:04:18,906 --> 00:04:20,474
The suspect was last seen
running south.

00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:22,309
These buildings have been
searched and cleared.

00:04:22,376 --> 00:04:23,343
Okay, move south one block.

00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:24,945
Check each apartment.

00:04:25,012 --> 00:04:26,680
This guy's armed
and dangerous.
You got a lot of witnesses

00:04:26,747 --> 00:04:28,048
claiming to have seen
what happened.

00:04:28,115 --> 00:04:29,116
Okay, good. Let's get some vans
down here,

00:04:29,183 --> 00:04:30,284
bring them all to the station.

00:04:30,351 --> 00:04:32,052
What happened out here?

00:04:32,119 --> 00:04:33,420
I was one of
the shooters.

00:04:33,487 --> 00:04:35,723
So was Sofia,
so you know the deal.

00:04:35,789 --> 00:04:37,725
That's really all
I'm allowed to say.

00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:39,593
I see Detective Ortega

00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,695
had a hard head
for my ass

00:04:41,762 --> 00:04:42,696
handling the case

00:04:42,763 --> 00:04:43,897
Just our luck.

00:04:45,299 --> 00:04:46,700
DETECTIVE:
Caprice full of shooters

00:04:46,767 --> 00:04:48,369
opened up
on two of our guys.
One's down.

00:04:48,435 --> 00:04:49,770
Is Bell
going to make it?

00:04:49,837 --> 00:04:51,438
He's DOA.

00:04:51,505 --> 00:04:52,973
Three suspects
are dead.

00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,541
Fourth outstanding.

00:04:54,608 --> 00:04:56,944
Excuse me...
guys, hang tight.

00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,445
I'm going to get
some rides.

00:04:58,512 --> 00:04:59,446
Take you down
to the station, okay?

00:04:59,513 --> 00:05:00,581
I want to get
your statements.

00:05:00,647 --> 00:05:01,915
BRASS:
Yeah...

00:05:01,982 --> 00:05:03,250
Yeah.
ORTEGA:
Good, good.

00:05:06,286 --> 00:05:07,421
I'll stay with them.

00:05:07,488 --> 00:05:08,922
I'll collect their
firearms and ammo.

00:05:08,989 --> 00:05:10,657
All right.
Good luck.

00:05:10,724 --> 00:05:11,759
Thank you.

00:05:12,693 --> 00:05:13,961

You shoot him?

00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:03,360
No, sir.
Found him this way.

00:06:04,328 --> 00:06:05,562
DETECTIVE:
Bike strap...

00:06:05,629 --> 00:06:06,563
This isn't our suspect.

00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,498
This is a kid on his way
to school.

00:06:08,565 --> 00:06:09,700
Where's his bike?
There was no bike.

00:06:09,766 --> 00:06:10,834
Put out a broadcast.

00:06:10,901 --> 00:06:14,204
Suspect may be on a bicycle.

00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,939
We need medical transport.
Code Three...

00:06:16,006 --> 00:06:19,176
Okay, everybody around here
has got a video camera

00:06:19,243 --> 00:06:20,677
or a cell phone camera.

00:06:20,744 --> 00:06:22,045
They'll all be
taking pictures.

00:06:22,112 --> 00:06:24,448
I think we all know
how to operate
in front of a camera.

00:06:24,514 --> 00:06:26,216
Don't be caught
picking your nose.

00:06:26,283 --> 00:06:28,585
GRISSOM:
Catherine's back
at the station,

00:06:28,652 --> 00:06:29,953
collecting the
officers' guns.

00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,755
This is the main crime scene.

00:06:31,822 --> 00:06:33,924
So Nick, you and
Sara, take this.

00:06:33,991 --> 00:06:35,259
There's two additional
crime scenes

00:06:35,325 --> 00:06:36,727
down the alleys behind Third.

00:06:36,793 --> 00:06:37,894
Warrick, you take
the west alley,

00:06:37,961 --> 00:06:38,929
I'll take the east.

00:06:38,996 --> 00:06:40,063
And what do I get to do?

00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:42,599
Go back to the lab
and wait for a phone call?

00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:45,869
This is a running gun battle
that started 20 blocks back.

00:06:45,936 --> 00:06:46,904
You get that.

00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:49,039
That's got to be, like, a mile?

00:06:49,106 --> 00:06:50,641
Who's with me?

00:06:50,707 --> 00:06:51,909
SARA:
A bunch of
pissed-off locals

00:06:51,975 --> 00:06:53,110
with shot up cars.

00:06:53,176 --> 00:06:54,411
Awesome.

00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:55,846
WARRICK:
You'll be all right.

00:07:05,489 --> 00:07:06,957
DAVID:
Grissom,

00:07:07,024 --> 00:07:08,992
heard anything about Bell?

00:07:09,059 --> 00:07:11,361
He died, David.

00:07:20,137 --> 00:07:21,772
Is this gun
in its original position?

00:07:21,838 --> 00:07:24,141
The arresting officers kicked it
clear of the suspect.

00:07:28,345 --> 00:07:32,015
Nobody's touched it
since I've been here.

00:07:34,384 --> 00:07:36,420
Well, there's
no bullet holes

00:07:36,486 --> 00:07:37,487
in the back.

00:07:37,554 --> 00:07:38,522
That's always good.

00:07:38,589 --> 00:07:40,424
How many times was he hit?

00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:41,592
I don't know.

00:07:41,658 --> 00:07:43,460
Officer, can you remove
these handcuffs?

00:07:43,527 --> 00:07:44,795
Sure.

00:07:52,269 --> 00:07:53,870
You have anything I can wipe
these off with?

00:07:53,937 --> 00:07:55,339
Yeah.

00:07:55,405 --> 00:07:56,707
Thanks.

00:08:04,881 --> 00:08:06,516
Looks like three went in.

00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:07,818
All right, leave him here,
David.

00:08:07,884 --> 00:08:10,621
Warrick's D.B.'s in
the other alley just over there.

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,441
You did a hell
of good job out there.

00:08:31,508 --> 00:08:34,945
Yeah, not good enough.

00:08:35,012 --> 00:08:36,546
Has Bell's wife
been notified?

00:08:36,613 --> 00:08:38,015
The Sheriff's on his way
to the house now.

00:08:38,081 --> 00:08:40,550
BRASS:
You know, she's pregnant

00:08:40,617 --> 00:08:42,986
with their third kid.

00:08:43,053 --> 00:08:45,689
We all know the risks.

00:08:48,992 --> 00:08:50,127
Hey...

00:08:54,898 --> 00:08:57,034
( <i>sighing</i> )

00:08:59,269 --> 00:09:01,038
I remember
my first shooting...

00:09:01,104 --> 00:09:04,675
I appreciate the sentiment.

00:09:04,741 --> 00:09:06,243
( <i>whispering</i> ):
We're not supposed to talk
to each other

00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:07,544
till we give our statements.

00:09:07,611 --> 00:09:08,612
You're right,
you're right

00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:09,613
You're up.

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,847
Curtis, make yourself
comfortable.

00:09:10,914 --> 00:09:12,115
Okay.

00:09:18,655 --> 00:09:20,390
This is Detective
Nestor Ortega.

00:09:20,457 --> 00:09:22,025
I am in PD Interrogation

00:09:22,092 --> 00:09:26,396
taking a statement
from Captain James Brass

00:09:26,463 --> 00:09:27,531
regarding the officer-involved
shooting

00:09:27,598 --> 00:09:31,935
that occurred around 0643
hours this morning.

00:09:32,002 --> 00:09:33,370
CSI Catherine Willows

00:09:33,437 --> 00:09:37,040
is present to document
and collect

00:09:37,107 --> 00:09:38,909
Captain Brass's firearm

00:09:38,976 --> 00:09:42,579
as evidence.

00:09:48,619 --> 00:09:50,153
Ready?

00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,588
Yeah.

00:09:54,191 --> 00:09:55,592
You're not a patrol unit.

00:09:55,659 --> 00:09:57,561
Why did you get involved

00:09:57,628 --> 00:09:59,263
in the pursuit?
Detective Curtis

00:09:59,329 --> 00:10:01,265
and I were just closing
a robbery case

00:10:01,331 --> 00:10:03,767
and, uh, we stopped
for a bite to eat.

00:10:03,834 --> 00:10:05,435
DISPATCHER:
... all units in the vicinity.

00:10:05,502 --> 00:10:06,737
Three-David-34 is in pursuit

00:10:06,803 --> 00:10:08,505
of a dark Chevy Caprice

00:10:08,572 --> 00:10:09,973
southbound on Paradise
toward Desert Springs.

00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,009
That's right near here.

00:10:15,012 --> 00:10:18,782
We joined the pursuit
on Desert Springs.

00:10:18,849 --> 00:10:22,352
So you elected to back up
the officers.

00:10:22,419 --> 00:10:23,787
Yes.

00:10:23,854 --> 00:10:25,822
Were the suspects
shooting at the time?

00:10:25,889 --> 00:10:27,090
Yes.

00:10:27,157 --> 00:10:28,859
Could you tell the types
of firearms they were using?

00:10:34,598 --> 00:10:37,301
Well, the two guys in the back
had rifles,

00:10:37,367 --> 00:10:39,202
maybe AK's.

00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:40,704
The other two had handguns.

00:10:40,771 --> 00:10:42,139
I'm not sure what type.

00:10:44,374 --> 00:10:45,842
REPORTER:
We're flying
over Third Street

00:10:45,909 --> 00:10:47,444
where just this morning,

00:10:47,511 --> 00:10:48,979
police were involved
in a deadly shootout.

00:10:56,587 --> 00:10:57,788
Looks like a porcupine.

00:10:57,854 --> 00:10:58,889
There's not enough room

00:10:58,956 --> 00:11:00,824
between rods
for a human being to fit.

00:11:00,891 --> 00:11:01,892
No, Bell and Adams

00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:05,195
must have really been
swerving and weaving.

00:11:07,564 --> 00:11:10,901
78 bullet holes.

00:11:10,968 --> 00:11:13,971
And Bell wasn't hit
until he was outside the car.

00:11:14,037 --> 00:11:18,108
I heard Bell was a rookie,
barely off training.

00:11:18,175 --> 00:11:20,777
It was just his time,
I guess, huh?

00:11:23,981 --> 00:11:25,349
Suspect will be
getting a ride
with the coroner.

00:11:25,415 --> 00:11:26,717
A little
street justice.

00:11:26,783 --> 00:11:27,818
Civilians okay?

00:11:27,884 --> 00:11:29,319
Some old lady's
going to need stitches.

00:11:29,386 --> 00:11:32,089
The kid on the bike's
critical in surgery.

00:11:32,155 --> 00:11:34,725
You guys okay here?

00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:37,694
I'll call and have the suspect's
vehicle towed to CSI.

00:11:37,761 --> 00:11:40,697
I'm going to start digging
bullets out of people's houses.

00:11:42,499 --> 00:11:45,836
I was just reloading
and continuing firing.

00:11:45,903 --> 00:11:47,070
I don't know what hit him.

00:11:47,137 --> 00:11:49,273
( <i>gunshots</i> )

00:11:51,975 --> 00:11:55,746
Bullets were flying.
There were multiple rounds.

00:11:55,812 --> 00:11:57,114
It was chaos.

00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:00,751
At what point did Carolyn Davis
go in foot pursuit

00:12:00,817 --> 00:12:02,586
after the two
suspects?

00:12:02,653 --> 00:12:04,821
After the driver went down,

00:12:04,888 --> 00:12:06,990
the other suspect,
I guess he felt

00:12:07,057 --> 00:12:08,158
it was getting
too hot back there.

00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,396
And they were shooting
the entire time?

00:12:12,462 --> 00:12:17,668
Oh, yeah. I mean, it was like,
you know, those movie guns;

00:12:17,734 --> 00:12:19,269
they never run out of bullets.

00:12:19,336 --> 00:12:21,204
I don't go to the movies.

00:12:21,271 --> 00:12:22,673
Oh.

00:12:25,175 --> 00:12:26,677
What happened next?

00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:31,415
The next thing I remember...

00:12:35,452 --> 00:12:38,255
the next thing I remember
is Bell.

00:12:43,327 --> 00:12:45,062
Bell went down.

00:12:45,128 --> 00:12:46,597
( <i>gunshot</i> )

00:12:56,173 --> 00:13:00,544
He was...
he was just a kid.

00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,685
MAN:
<i>Todo lo que vi fue la policia</i>
<i>disparando!</i>

00:13:09,752 --> 00:13:11,220
MAN 2:
<i>Yo ohi que uno de ellos</i>

00:13:11,287 --> 00:13:13,000
<i>ya se habia calmado cuando</i>
<i>le metieron un balazo!</i>

00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:14,910
Are they saying
what I think they're saying?

00:13:14,976 --> 00:13:19,247
<i>"Policia hirieron</i>
<i>esos muchachos en la espalda"?</i>

00:13:19,314 --> 00:13:23,185
Yeah. They claim they saw
the cops shoot the suspects
in the back.

00:13:23,251 --> 00:13:25,921
Hey, not to mention
there's an innocent kid
in the hospital.

00:13:25,987 --> 00:13:28,323
See? Another
one they killed!
Where's his gun!

00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,458
CAVALIERE:
Hey, let us do
our job here, okay?

00:13:30,525 --> 00:13:31,927
WOMAN:
<i>Mi hija vio a sus policias</i>

00:13:31,993 --> 00:13:33,461
<i>disparle a un nino</i>
<i>en la espalda.</i>

00:13:33,528 --> 00:13:36,431
<i>Senora, donde esta</i>
<i>su hija, huh?</i>

00:13:36,498 --> 00:13:38,300
<i>Queremos hablar con ella.</i>

00:13:38,366 --> 00:13:40,001
<i>La policia se la llevo.</i>

00:13:40,068 --> 00:13:42,904
<i>Usted vio algo de lo que paso?</i>

00:13:42,971 --> 00:13:45,073
No?

00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:47,142
Nobody saw anything.

00:13:47,209 --> 00:13:49,144
I don't think
this is police issue.

00:13:49,211 --> 00:13:51,279
Look, these folks were
suspicious of the cops

00:13:51,346 --> 00:13:52,881
long before this happened.

00:13:52,948 --> 00:13:54,516
Now this is now your circle
stories get started.

00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:57,652
The story keeps changing
till you don't know
what the truth is

00:13:57,719 --> 00:14:00,121
or whose story
it was to begin with.

00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:07,596
So, uh, so the suspects saw
that we were kind of distracted

00:14:07,662 --> 00:14:11,800
helping Bell, and they took
the opportunity.

00:14:11,867 --> 00:14:13,335
I went on foot pursuit,
you know.

00:14:13,401 --> 00:14:16,304
They, uh... I can't run as fast
as I used to,

00:14:16,371 --> 00:14:19,441
I mean,
so I lost them.

00:14:19,507 --> 00:14:23,411
But that's when I heard
the two shots.

00:14:23,478 --> 00:14:30,051
No, I heard shots coming from...
the east.

00:14:30,118 --> 00:14:31,219
How many?

00:14:31,286 --> 00:14:33,522
Three.

00:14:36,558 --> 00:14:40,395
OFFICER:
Get down!
( <i>four gunshots</i> )

00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:43,064
Four.

00:14:43,131 --> 00:14:44,499
And they sound

00:14:44,566 --> 00:14:47,168
a lot louder
than a nine-millimeter.

00:14:50,405 --> 00:14:52,707
The suspect had a gun
in his hand.

00:14:52,774 --> 00:14:54,109
Oh, yeah, definitely.

00:14:54,175 --> 00:14:55,377
I kicked it away
when I cuffed him.

00:14:57,112 --> 00:14:58,880
Did you fire any shots
in the alley?

00:14:58,947 --> 00:15:00,715
I didn't have to.

00:15:00,782 --> 00:15:03,118
Captain, hand over your firearm
to CSI Willows.

00:15:07,589 --> 00:15:09,624
Any magazines?

00:15:09,691 --> 00:15:10,859
Uh...

00:15:14,896 --> 00:15:17,199
I must have used them..

00:15:23,972 --> 00:15:27,742
WILLOWS:
Captain Brass's service pistol

00:15:27,809 --> 00:15:31,012
was received
with an empty magazine

00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:33,748
and one live round
in the chamber.

00:15:33,815 --> 00:15:35,884
Well...

00:15:35,951 --> 00:15:37,185
It'd be smart to have ammo

00:15:37,252 --> 00:15:38,920
before you go running
into a gunfight.

00:15:45,994 --> 00:15:48,597
I didn't find any
cartridge casings

00:15:48,663 --> 00:15:50,866
in this alley
from the dead guy's gun.

00:15:50,932 --> 00:15:53,635
Just these three
nine-millimeters from our cop.

00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:57,973
So he must have
been out of ammo.

00:15:58,039 --> 00:16:00,609
Yeah, but he had to know that
he'd get shot holding a gun

00:16:00,675 --> 00:16:01,643
whether it was loaded or not.

00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,411
Why didn't
he just toss it?

00:16:03,478 --> 00:16:05,413
Maybe he didn't know he was out.
Heat of the battle.

00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,815
I mean, we're not talking
rocket scientists.

00:16:08,783 --> 00:16:10,685
That doesn't make him suicidal,
though, does it?

00:16:22,531 --> 00:16:25,634
Officer Adams,
I'm sorry for your loss.

00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,870
If you'd like a few minutes
to say good-bye...

00:16:53,061 --> 00:16:54,763
Okay, partner...

00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:00,602
I guess I was pretty
rough on you.

00:17:00,669 --> 00:17:03,505
Maybe not rough enough.

00:17:07,976 --> 00:17:09,945
You're the best rookie
I ever trained.

00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:16,318
I have to leave you now.

00:17:16,384 --> 00:17:19,754
I'll, uh, I'll talk to Tracy.

00:17:19,821 --> 00:17:23,458
Try to make her understand.

00:17:23,525 --> 00:17:25,327
Drop in on the kids.

00:17:29,497 --> 00:17:31,333
You were a good cop.

00:17:37,405 --> 00:17:40,275
CAVALIERE:
Geraldo Zamesca.
High school football star.

00:17:40,342 --> 00:17:41,376
Full scholarship to USC.

00:17:41,443 --> 00:17:42,878
Got a bullet
lodged in his spine

00:17:42,944 --> 00:17:44,546
Condition's critical.

00:17:44,613 --> 00:17:46,047
Can we get the bullet?

00:17:46,114 --> 00:17:49,784
Not unless his condition
improves or he dies.

00:17:49,851 --> 00:17:52,387
SWAT guys going
house-to-house
breaking down doors.

00:17:52,454 --> 00:17:53,755
They're the ones
who found him.

00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,790
They were going to
blame us for this, too.

00:17:55,857 --> 00:17:57,726
CSI's processed
the scene?

00:17:57,792 --> 00:18:00,428
Not much to process.
Some blood stains
off the ground

00:18:00,495 --> 00:18:02,197
Nine-millimeter
cartridge case.

00:18:02,264 --> 00:18:06,001
Cops are shooting nines.

00:18:06,067 --> 00:18:07,802
Guilty until
proven innocent.

00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:10,939
DANILO:
This is my wife,
Geraldo's mother.

00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:12,073
We want nothing

00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,074
but the best
for our son.

00:18:13,141 --> 00:18:14,309
That means we will
decide if you go in

00:18:14,376 --> 00:18:15,510
and get the bullet,
not the police.

00:18:15,577 --> 00:18:17,379
DANILO:
You got that?

00:18:20,448 --> 00:18:22,584
Kid's family?

00:18:23,051 --> 00:18:24,719
Yeah.

00:18:24,786 --> 00:18:27,022
Danilo Zamesca,
a local business man
that lives in the 'hood,

00:18:27,088 --> 00:18:30,625
but dines uptown.

00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:33,361

<i>Nosotros no hicimos nada.</i>

00:18:38,266 --> 00:18:40,302
<i>Porque la policia</i>
<i>nos disparo?</i>

00:18:40,368 --> 00:18:43,071

<i>Die algo para que ella</i>
<i>entienda.</i>

She wants to know why
our house got shot at.

00:18:55,483 --> 00:18:58,587
I don't have the answer to that.
I'm sorry.

00:18:58,653 --> 00:19:01,223
<i>Es que usted no me puede</i>
<i>decir nada?</i>

00:19:01,289 --> 00:19:02,390
<i>No vio lo que hicieron?</i>

<i>Que si fueran mis hijos?</i>

<i>Que voy hacer</i>
<i>sin mis hijos?</i>

( <i>sobbing</i> )

00:19:29,217 --> 00:19:31,152
So, what do you think
that is?

00:19:31,219 --> 00:19:32,521
Well, it's not blood,

00:19:32,587 --> 00:19:34,322
it's not rust.

00:19:34,389 --> 00:19:36,458
Where did Grissom
find that?

00:19:36,525 --> 00:19:37,959
In an alley off Third.

00:19:38,026 --> 00:19:43,431
'Cause see, those
scrapes and gauges
look like road rash.

00:19:43,498 --> 00:19:45,734
Like when you toss a gun
out of a moving car.

00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:51,573
You'd be the one
to know about rashes.

00:20:22,103 --> 00:20:23,171
That's my brother, man!

00:20:23,238 --> 00:20:24,239
What'd he do?!

My baby! My baby!

00:20:26,474 --> 00:20:28,510
You killed my son!

My baby!

You cops murdered my son!

00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,416
Miss,

00:20:34,482 --> 00:20:36,484
You murdered my son!
calm down, okay?

00:20:36,551 --> 00:20:39,921
I'm sorry for your loss.
I'm with the crime lab.

00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:41,156
Talk to one
of the detectives. Miss...

00:20:41,223 --> 00:20:42,324
I don't need to!

Look, police brutality!
He's hitting me!

00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:46,194
Can I get some backup
here, please?

00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:55,837
Now you want my other son, huh?

00:20:55,904 --> 00:20:56,905
Is that what you want?

00:20:56,972 --> 00:20:58,907
I just want
to do my job here.

00:20:58,974 --> 00:21:01,443
What, lie
for the police department?

00:21:01,509 --> 00:21:02,944
Can we lock this place up

00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,613
and move that crime tape
down another block?

00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:06,848
OFFICER:
Officer Mitchell,
come into the west alley.

00:21:06,915 --> 00:21:09,084
Bring two uniforms
with you.

00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:11,186
These people think if they catch
us doing something wrong,

00:21:11,253 --> 00:21:12,621
they sue and win the lottery.

00:21:12,687 --> 00:21:14,222
Yeah. We don't do
anything wrong,

00:21:14,289 --> 00:21:15,957
we got nothing
to worry about.

00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,250
My son should be
in school today.

00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,709
He should be
playing football.

00:21:25,709 --> 00:21:29,046
Instead, he's lying
in a hospital bed.

00:21:29,112 --> 00:21:31,248
Why?

00:21:31,315 --> 00:21:33,283
Because the cops decided
to shoot first

00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,518
and ask questions later.

00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:36,720
<i>Anybody remember the last time</i>

00:21:36,787 --> 00:21:39,523

<i>gun battle down the Strip?</i>

00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:42,392
<i>No? That's 'cause</i>
<i>it's never happened.</i>

00:21:42,459 --> 00:21:43,727
<i>Summerlin? Never.</i>

00:21:43,794 --> 00:21:45,996
Seven Hills?

00:21:46,063 --> 00:21:47,664
No way.

00:21:47,731 --> 00:21:49,866
But down here, hey..

00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,368
( <i>sobbing</i> )

00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:56,606
<i>My son, Geraldo,</i>
<i>was a good boy.</i>

00:21:56,673 --> 00:21:59,343
<i>He was a great</i>
<i>football player.</i>

00:21:59,409 --> 00:22:01,778
<i>Fearless out there.</i>

00:22:01,845 --> 00:22:03,080
<i>He had a chance</i>

00:22:03,146 --> 00:22:06,149
<i>to do something</i>
<i>with his life.</i>

00:22:06,216 --> 00:22:08,518
<i>To be better</i>
<i>than his father.</i>

00:22:08,585 --> 00:22:10,554
<i>And now...</i>

00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:14,424
I may outlive my son.

00:22:14,491 --> 00:22:17,461
Because the police shot him

00:22:17,527 --> 00:22:21,531
before he could tell them
who he was.

00:22:21,598 --> 00:22:23,767
<i>Before he could tell them</i>

00:22:23,834 --> 00:22:25,902
<i>he was an honor student.</i>

00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:29,039
<i>I want to invite everybody here</i>
<i>who cares about</i>

00:22:29,106 --> 00:22:31,341
what happens in the community

00:22:31,408 --> 00:22:34,878
to come to Queen of Angels
tonight, 6:00 p.m.,

00:22:34,945 --> 00:22:38,148
<i>to pray for Geraldo's life.</i>

00:22:38,215 --> 00:22:39,983
<i>And I want to say</i>

00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:43,654
<i>out loud, right now,</i>
<i>to Sheriff Burdick,</i>

00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,389
<i>this will not stand.</i>

00:22:45,455 --> 00:22:48,759
You, sir,
will be held to answer.

00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:53,063
I mean it.

00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:54,965
I'm not going away.

00:22:55,032 --> 00:22:57,501
A police spokesman confirms
that department officials

00:22:57,567 --> 00:22:58,835
are looking into all allegations

00:22:58,902 --> 00:23:00,904
of brutality
and misconduct.

00:23:00,971 --> 00:23:02,939
Sheriff Burdick could not be
reached for comment.

00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:05,008
Here is what we know so far...

00:23:05,075 --> 00:23:07,477
Nobody gives a crap
about a dead officer.

00:23:07,544 --> 00:23:10,981
I don't see them
lighting candles for Bell.

00:23:11,048 --> 00:23:12,549
...this morning
with a car chase.

00:23:12,616 --> 00:23:14,051
The pursuit ended
in a shootout

00:23:14,117 --> 00:23:15,552
at Jefferson and 3rd Street

00:23:15,619 --> 00:23:18,789
between a heavily armed suspects
and police.

00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:21,158
WILLOWS:
Detective Curtis'
service pistol was received

00:23:21,224 --> 00:23:23,260
with one magazine containing
three live rounds

00:23:23,327 --> 00:23:24,528
and one live round

00:23:24,594 --> 00:23:27,030
in the chamber.

00:23:27,097 --> 00:23:28,732
During the gun battle,
were you aware

00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,134
of the other officers positions
relative to you?

00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:35,605
They were in front of me
and... and to my right.

00:23:35,672 --> 00:23:37,507
No, my left.

00:23:37,574 --> 00:23:39,409
Did you continue to be aware
of their positions

00:23:39,476 --> 00:23:40,444
after the suspect

00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:41,945
took off running?

00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:47,050
( <i>gunfire</i> )

00:23:57,694 --> 00:23:58,795
Uh...

00:23:58,862 --> 00:24:02,766
Bell was in front of me...

00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:04,568
but he was down
behind his car.

00:24:04,635 --> 00:24:07,004
Do you remember Officer Bell
being shot?

00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,190
Um...

00:24:29,293 --> 00:24:32,362
S-Sorry, what was the question?

00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:35,632
I asked if you remember
Officer Bell being shot.

00:24:37,401 --> 00:24:39,202
Do you need a moment here?
No, no, that's
all right.

00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:40,537
She's going to do just fine.

00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:43,373
Uh...

00:24:47,311 --> 00:24:49,880
Make sure you check Bell's vest.

00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:52,249
I think he took one
in the chest.

00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:57,120
Detective Ortega, Catherine,
can you step out

00:24:57,187 --> 00:24:59,556
for a moment?

00:25:03,994 --> 00:25:05,662
We're not done.

00:25:10,267 --> 00:25:12,202
So how are we doing
on the suspect

00:25:12,269 --> 00:25:13,303
that got away?

00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:14,371
Jose Fausto.

00:25:14,438 --> 00:25:15,906
Identified through
prints in the car.

00:25:15,973 --> 00:25:17,240
He's got a long rap sheet.

00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:18,308
Dogs lost his scent.

00:25:18,375 --> 00:25:20,811
SWAT guys checked
the building-- nothing.

00:25:20,877 --> 00:25:22,646
Gang unit's beating the bushes.

00:25:22,713 --> 00:25:25,048
Word on the street is
we shot two unarmed men

00:25:25,115 --> 00:25:26,450
and a high school kid.

00:25:26,516 --> 00:25:27,551
We got I.D.'s

00:25:27,617 --> 00:25:28,852
of all three dead suspects.

00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:31,254
Multiple felonies,
drugs, immigration violations.

00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:32,956
They're all members
of the 18th Street Chucos.

00:25:33,023 --> 00:25:34,524
Also driving
a stolen car

00:25:34,591 --> 00:25:36,126
shooting automatic
weapons

00:25:36,193 --> 00:25:37,694
at a police car.

00:25:37,761 --> 00:25:39,563
These guys aren't
exactly altar boys.

00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:42,499
West alley, I got eye-witnesses
saw po-po plant the gun.

00:25:42,566 --> 00:25:44,368
East alley, I got an old lady
who swears

00:25:44,434 --> 00:25:46,303
she saw Ricardo Estevez
with his hands raised

00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:47,404
before he was killed.

00:25:47,471 --> 00:25:48,905
These witnesses credible?

00:25:48,972 --> 00:25:50,774
I don't know.

00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:52,242
Listen,
if the suspects

00:25:52,309 --> 00:25:53,543
don't have guns
in their hands,

00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:54,745
we can't shoot them.

00:25:54,811 --> 00:25:56,546
Well, let's not get ahead
of the evidence.

00:25:56,613 --> 00:25:57,981
CAVALIERE:
Okay, one more thing.

00:25:58,048 --> 00:25:59,850
The family of Leandro Chavez

00:25:59,916 --> 00:26:01,451
is suing the department
for wrongful death.

00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:03,720
Claims we delayed
treatment.

00:26:17,734 --> 00:26:20,137
Medium caliber bullet--

00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:22,072
transected the
femoral artery.

00:26:22,139 --> 00:26:24,141
Major artery. Fatal wound.

00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:25,175
( <i>gunshot</i> )

00:26:25,242 --> 00:26:26,810
( <i>screaming</i> )

00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:29,980
Take a look. What's missing?

00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:35,385
All of the organs
seem to be in the right place.

00:26:35,452 --> 00:26:36,987
Look closer.

00:26:37,054 --> 00:26:38,889
Okay.

00:26:39,823 --> 00:26:40,824
Kidneys are...

00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:43,126
a bit pale.

00:26:43,193 --> 00:26:44,294
Liver is light tan.

00:26:44,361 --> 00:26:45,562
Right.

00:26:45,629 --> 00:26:47,431
Not a lot of blood.

00:26:49,099 --> 00:26:50,734
Dead at the scene.

00:26:50,801 --> 00:26:51,835
He bled out.

00:26:51,902 --> 00:26:52,903
Bingo.

00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:55,005
The wound was not
immediately fatal.

00:26:55,072 --> 00:26:56,540
It took a while.

00:26:56,606 --> 00:26:58,241
This is going to look bad.

00:26:58,308 --> 00:27:00,544
David, it is what it is.

00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:09,586
Why did you leave
a downed officer?

00:27:11,888 --> 00:27:16,526
Sergeant Adams told me he had
the situation under control.

00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:19,329
So I went

00:27:19,396 --> 00:27:22,499
to back up Officer Davis,
who ran off in...

00:27:22,566 --> 00:27:24,434
this direction.

00:27:24,501 --> 00:27:26,269
I caught up with him here.

00:27:28,939 --> 00:27:30,207
( <i>click</i> )

00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:32,709
Davis' slide was locked back.

00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:34,011
He was out of ammo.

00:27:34,077 --> 00:27:37,881
So the suspect had a gun
pointed at Officer Davis.

00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,756
Of course.

00:27:48,091 --> 00:27:50,060
That was why I fired.

00:27:55,432 --> 00:27:56,967
100% sure?

00:27:58,268 --> 00:28:00,971
Yes.

00:28:01,038 --> 00:28:02,673
What did you do next?

00:28:05,142 --> 00:28:06,376
What are you doing?
Put it down.

00:28:06,443 --> 00:28:08,645
Yeah, sorry. I was just trying
to secure his gun.

00:28:08,712 --> 00:28:10,447
Okay, he's not going
to be using it anymore.

00:28:10,514 --> 00:28:13,283
Officer Davis was acting
on survival instinct,

00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:15,585
not training.

00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:20,924
It was understandable
under the circumstances.

00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:23,327
I don't think so.

00:28:45,882 --> 00:28:48,118
Want a ride?

00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:52,089
No, I'm just going
to go home.

00:28:52,155 --> 00:28:54,925
You sure?

00:28:54,992 --> 00:28:57,027
Yeah.

00:29:28,125 --> 00:29:30,627
( <i>sliding click</i> )

00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:02,326
Okay, the first
communication
I received

00:30:02,392 --> 00:30:08,432
from Three-David-34
was at 06:43:37.

00:30:08,498 --> 00:30:11,601
This is Three-David-34
requesting immediate backup.

00:30:11,668 --> 00:30:13,203
New suspect vehicle

00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:16,239
Adam-Robert-Charlie-208, Nevada,

00:30:16,306 --> 00:30:18,875
dark Chevy Caprice,
four suspects.

00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:20,010
Suspects are armed.

00:30:20,077 --> 00:30:21,845
WOMAN:
Copy, Three-David-34.

00:30:21,912 --> 00:30:24,915
What did Bell mean by
"new suspect vehicle"?

00:30:24,982 --> 00:30:27,017
Can you take it back
to the last communication

00:30:27,084 --> 00:30:29,086
before that call?

00:30:29,152 --> 00:30:32,055
Control, this is Three-David-34.

00:30:32,122 --> 00:30:36,193
We'll be 487, 12000 block
of Roosevelt

00:30:36,259 --> 00:30:39,429
on David-Nora-Charlie-130,
Buick Regal.

00:30:41,431 --> 00:30:43,233
WILLOWS:
A 487

00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,234
is a traffic stop.

00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:45,402
You were pulling over
a Buick?

00:30:45,469 --> 00:30:46,737
That's correct.

00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:48,438
Why'd you leave the Buick
and start following the Caprice?

00:30:48,505 --> 00:30:49,706
Didn't leave the Buick.

00:30:49,773 --> 00:30:50,874
The Caprice cut in.

00:30:50,941 --> 00:30:53,777
( <i>siren wailing</i> )

00:30:55,345 --> 00:30:57,114
Why'd he do that?
Don't know.

00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:59,416
The next thing I know,
we were taking fire.

00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:01,618
Forgot all about the Buick.

00:31:01,685 --> 00:31:03,487
WILLOWS:
Did you see
where it went?

00:31:03,553 --> 00:31:04,888
I was kind of busy.

00:31:14,333 --> 00:31:16,750
Hey, you done yet?

00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:20,929
Grissom, am I
on overtime?

00:31:20,996 --> 00:31:22,631
Of course.

00:31:22,697 --> 00:31:24,132
Did everyone else go home?

00:31:24,199 --> 00:31:25,266
No.

00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:26,935
Good to know.

00:31:27,002 --> 00:31:30,171
Well, I finished
about ten blocks so far.

00:31:30,238 --> 00:31:34,275
That's 98
cartridge cases.

00:31:34,342 --> 00:31:36,778
Let's see-- double L,
A to Z's 26,

00:31:36,845 --> 00:31:39,180
That's 38 bullet impacts.

00:31:39,247 --> 00:31:40,215
Good.

00:31:40,282 --> 00:31:42,317
Pursuit started ten blocks
farther down.

00:31:42,384 --> 00:31:43,785
You're halfway done.

00:31:43,852 --> 00:31:46,187
I've got like three or four
hours more work left.

00:31:46,254 --> 00:31:47,822
Can I have some help?

00:31:47,889 --> 00:31:49,758
Everybody's busy.

00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:51,192
I think you missed one.

00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:00,735
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

00:32:02,604 --> 00:32:03,605
Grissom.

00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:04,673
Hey.

00:32:04,739 --> 00:32:06,274
I just interviewed
Sergeant Adams.

00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:08,243
He and Bell were making
a routine traffic stop

00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:09,344
when the Caprice cut in.

00:32:09,411 --> 00:32:10,679
The initial vehicle was a...

00:32:10,745 --> 00:32:12,047
A Buick?

00:32:12,113 --> 00:32:14,049
I hate it when you do that.

00:32:14,115 --> 00:32:16,051
Lucky guess.

00:32:16,117 --> 00:32:18,053
I'll call you back.

00:32:19,587 --> 00:32:22,257
How'd you know that hubcap
was connected to the case?

00:32:22,324 --> 00:32:24,392
I'm a trained
observer, Greg.

00:32:24,459 --> 00:32:25,827
No, really.

00:32:25,894 --> 00:32:29,230
How long do you think a
perfectly good hubcap like this

00:32:29,297 --> 00:32:30,832
would sit around out here?

00:32:30,899 --> 00:32:32,534
There's a freeway
on-ramp

00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,668
about two blocks away.

00:32:33,735 --> 00:32:35,303
Check and see if there's
any traffic cams

00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,338
between here and there.

00:32:36,404 --> 00:32:38,506
You know, you scare me
sometimes.

00:32:38,573 --> 00:32:39,708
It's kind
of freaky.

00:32:39,774 --> 00:32:42,344
You ever bet
on the ponies?

00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:43,545
I prefer poker.

00:32:43,612 --> 00:32:45,080
Horses are hard to control.

00:32:47,649 --> 00:32:50,752
Make sure you document
these skid marks.

00:32:50,819 --> 00:32:52,454
He said "skid marks."

00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,922
( <i>snickering</i> )

00:32:53,989 --> 00:32:55,590
( <i>gunshot</i> )

00:32:57,892 --> 00:32:59,761
Oh-ho-ho! Yeah!

00:32:59,828 --> 00:33:01,563
That's what I'm talking about.

00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:04,199
I got over firing AK's
a long time ago.

00:33:09,137 --> 00:33:11,773
Hey... Mustache Boy,
come over here

00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,876
and check this out.

00:33:16,311 --> 00:33:17,812
Get a load of that.

00:33:20,949 --> 00:33:24,052
Whoa.

00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:27,289
What are the chances
of that happening?
Like one in a million.

00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:32,961
The bullet jammed
this cylinder.

00:33:33,028 --> 00:33:35,630
You know, I couldn't clear
this gun at the scene.

00:33:35,697 --> 00:33:37,432
I should've noticed
these bullet fragments.

00:33:37,499 --> 00:33:39,134
I guess I got distracted.

00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,071
Well, the bullet had to come
from Officer Davis's pistol...

00:33:43,138 --> 00:33:44,806
but if you're the suspect,

00:33:44,873 --> 00:33:47,142
don't you know
your gun's getting hit?

00:33:47,208 --> 00:33:50,445
I think it would have felt
like a normal recoil.

00:33:50,512 --> 00:33:52,047
Besides, it was like

00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,581
the Wild West
out there.

00:33:53,648 --> 00:33:56,551
You don't have to tell <i>me;</i>
I know it was crazy out there.

00:33:56,618 --> 00:33:59,621
You know, I pulled 78 bullets
out of one car.

00:33:59,688 --> 00:34:02,590
Davis just got lucky.

00:34:02,657 --> 00:34:05,060
This suspect had
one live round left.

00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:07,228
It saved Davis's life.

00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:08,496
Well, there you go.

00:34:08,563 --> 00:34:10,899
Proves he was pointing the gun
at the officer.

00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:13,735
See you in court;
stroke one up for the good guys.

00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:16,638
We still have to place it
in Rosario's hand.

00:34:18,273 --> 00:34:20,108
( <i>woman sniffles</i> )

00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:25,413
This is, uh, Gil Grissom
from the Crime Lab.

00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,749
This is Officer Bell's wife.

00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:30,018
Mrs. Bell, I'm so
sorry about the loss

00:34:30,085 --> 00:34:32,187
of your husband--
he was a fine man.
( <i>sobs</i> )

00:34:32,253 --> 00:34:34,422
( <i>sobbing</i> )

00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:36,791
Why are they crying?

00:34:36,858 --> 00:34:39,361
McKEEN:
Um, why don't I
drive you home.

00:34:39,427 --> 00:34:42,297
They're crying for the man
that killed my husband.

00:34:42,364 --> 00:34:43,632
What did you say?
You heard me.

00:34:43,698 --> 00:34:47,469
If you did a better job
of raising your son,
I wouldn't be here.

00:34:47,535 --> 00:34:49,938
Don't you tell me
how to raise my children!
You should be ashamed!

00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:51,840
( <i>man shouting in Spanish</i> )

00:34:51,906 --> 00:34:52,974
How dare you!

00:35:03,385 --> 00:35:04,386
( <i>gunshot</i> )

00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:37,118
You run the gauntlet?

00:35:37,185 --> 00:35:39,721
Yeah.

00:35:39,788 --> 00:35:41,389
Ferro-tracing his hands?

00:35:41,456 --> 00:35:42,424
Yeah.

00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:44,225
I'm trying to prove Rosario here

00:35:44,292 --> 00:35:45,560
held the gun.

00:35:45,627 --> 00:35:48,330
Good old
pyridyldiphenyl triazine.

00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:50,832
I'm hoping this stuff reacts
to the traces of iron

00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:52,767
that may have been
left on his skin.

00:35:52,834 --> 00:35:54,002
It'll further
refute any argument

00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:55,704
that the gun
was a plant.

00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:02,210
GRISSOM:
That could be the back strap

00:36:02,277 --> 00:36:03,578
of a gun.

00:36:03,645 --> 00:36:07,315
Yeah. That would do it.

00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:15,190
Detective,
do you have a moment?

00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:17,692
Uh, yeah, I'm kind
of busy-- what is it?

00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:19,527
I picked up a junkie
for possession,

00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:21,096
outside a fleabag motel
off Fremont.

00:36:21,162 --> 00:36:22,564
And what?

00:36:22,631 --> 00:36:25,300
And... last night,
he spotted your shooter.

00:36:30,405 --> 00:36:33,308
Let's talk to him.

00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:37,979
You know this guy?

00:36:38,046 --> 00:36:39,247
What if I do?

00:36:39,314 --> 00:36:41,950
What'll it get me?

00:36:42,017 --> 00:36:44,319
He's a cop killer.
Gets you nothing.

00:36:44,386 --> 00:36:46,454
Hey, no need
to get hostile.

00:36:46,521 --> 00:36:48,690
Hey, man, you don't
know what hostile is.

00:36:51,159 --> 00:36:52,961
Will it at least
get me a ride home?

00:36:53,028 --> 00:36:55,563
( <i>quietly</i> ):
Come on...
Okay, okay.

00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:58,733
I-I do a lot of business
at the Lucky Seven Motel.

00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,269
And that guy checked in
last night.

00:37:01,336 --> 00:37:05,307
He scored a little something
to help get him some sleep.

00:37:05,373 --> 00:37:07,609
But he didn't pay.

00:37:07,676 --> 00:37:09,611
He just flashed his piece.

00:37:09,678 --> 00:37:10,745
Nine-millimeter?

00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:12,013
Yeah.

00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,749
He wanted a... a girl,

00:37:14,816 --> 00:37:18,386
and I gave him a number.

00:37:18,453 --> 00:37:20,789
That dude's bad news.

00:37:22,724 --> 00:37:24,225
I want to give him to you.

00:37:26,294 --> 00:37:27,729
Glad you're here.

00:37:27,796 --> 00:37:30,165
I'd like to get this
one off my table.

00:37:30,231 --> 00:37:31,933
Found a rather large

00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,935
contusion on the left chest

00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:35,337
just below the nipple.

00:37:35,403 --> 00:37:36,571
Well, that location
is consistent

00:37:36,638 --> 00:37:38,139
with the bullet Catherine found

00:37:38,206 --> 00:37:40,809
embedded in his vest.
It's like getting
kicked by a mule.

00:37:40,875 --> 00:37:42,043
You'll want to see this.

00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:44,813
Through-and-through.

00:37:44,879 --> 00:37:47,582
Entrance wound just
below his left ear,

00:37:47,649 --> 00:37:49,851
exited below
and to the front

00:37:49,918 --> 00:37:52,320
of his right ear, severing
the right common carotid.

00:37:52,387 --> 00:37:53,288
( <i>gunshot</i> )

00:37:53,355 --> 00:37:55,256
( <i>gasps, grunts</i> )

00:37:55,757 --> 00:37:57,225
That's your C.O.D.

00:37:57,292 --> 00:37:58,827
Fortunately,

00:37:58,893 --> 00:38:00,829
he never felt a thing.

00:38:03,131 --> 00:38:06,668
Left to right, back to front.

00:38:06,735 --> 00:38:07,836
Mm-hmm.

00:38:07,902 --> 00:38:10,405
Only cops were shooting
in that direction.

00:38:10,472 --> 00:38:13,008
Are you saying Bell was hit
by friendly fire?

00:38:13,074 --> 00:38:15,243
Maybe not so friendly.

00:38:34,996 --> 00:38:35,997
Who's in the room?

00:38:36,064 --> 00:38:37,599
Some john, I don't know.
Shh!

00:38:37,666 --> 00:38:40,001
Is that him?
Mm-hmm.

00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:42,070
I couldn't wait
to get out of there.

00:38:42,137 --> 00:38:44,439
He was acting real nervous.

00:38:44,506 --> 00:38:46,107
Now I know why.

00:38:46,174 --> 00:38:48,410
I took care of him;
he's asleep.

00:38:48,476 --> 00:38:50,045
So you're not gonna
bust <i>me,</i> right?

00:38:50,111 --> 00:38:52,247
Take her out of here.

00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,785
( <i>officers shouting</i> )

00:38:56,851 --> 00:38:58,186
Police! Let me see your hands!

00:38:58,253 --> 00:38:59,220
Do it now!

00:38:59,287 --> 00:39:00,755
Get on the floor!

00:39:00,822 --> 00:39:01,756
Down!

00:39:07,796 --> 00:39:10,565
That's our guy.

00:39:18,039 --> 00:39:20,041
He's carrying a nine.

00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:21,743
MAN:
Clear.

00:39:23,545 --> 00:39:26,081
We'll run this gun
against the cartridge case

00:39:26,147 --> 00:39:27,916
from the poor kid on the bike.

00:39:27,983 --> 00:39:31,019
I'm guessing you didn't
save up for that one, huh?

00:39:33,355 --> 00:39:35,156
( <i>two gunshots)</i>
( <i>yells</i> )

00:39:35,223 --> 00:39:38,393
You shoot an innocent kid in
the back just to take his bike?

00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,161
You piece of crap!
Get up!

00:39:40,228 --> 00:39:42,097
Hey, you're gonna wish
you kept running.

00:39:42,163 --> 00:39:43,665
They hate cop killers

00:39:43,732 --> 00:39:45,300
in Vegas,
you hear me? Huh?

00:39:45,367 --> 00:39:47,569
Come on, let me get
dressed up first, huh?

00:39:47,636 --> 00:39:50,372
We got a jumpsuit
just your size, don't worry.

00:39:51,673 --> 00:39:55,377
( <i>indistinct conversations</i> )

00:40:05,353 --> 00:40:07,689
( <i>gunshot</i> )
( <i>Fausto yells</i> )

00:40:07,756 --> 00:40:09,324
Down! Everybody down! Down!

00:40:13,561 --> 00:40:14,709
Where did that come from?
