00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:19,917
Red. Hey.

00:01:19,917 --> 00:01:21,052
( <i>chuckles nervously</i> )

00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:22,053
You look good, man.

00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:23,721
It's been a while, hasn't it?

00:01:23,788 --> 00:01:26,223
Haven't seen you forever.

00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:30,328
Of course, you know that
better than anybody.

00:01:30,394 --> 00:01:33,130
I'm... surprised
to see you here.

00:01:36,133 --> 00:01:38,970
Actually, you know what,
I'm not that surprised.

00:01:39,036 --> 00:01:41,072
Listen,
I'm glad you dropped by,

00:01:41,138 --> 00:01:43,240
'cause there I've been meaning
to talk to you about.

00:01:43,307 --> 00:01:44,742
No, I-I just wanted
to say...

00:02:37,251 --> 00:02:38,619
Oh, my God!

00:02:38,686 --> 00:02:39,954
Oh, my God!

00:02:44,858 --> 00:02:45,826
Oh, my God.

00:02:45,893 --> 00:02:48,162
Oh, my God.

00:02:48,229 --> 00:02:49,797
( <i>groans</i> )
Are you...

00:02:49,864 --> 00:02:52,766
Are you okay?

00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:55,035
Yeah, yeah, I'm...

00:02:55,102 --> 00:02:57,671
I'm okay. I'm okay.

00:02:57,738 --> 00:02:59,940
I-I am so sorry.

00:03:00,007 --> 00:03:02,309
I was on the phone,
and I was going too fast,

00:03:02,376 --> 00:03:03,477
and I just...

00:03:03,544 --> 00:03:05,279
Oh, God, um...
I'm going to call 911,

00:03:05,346 --> 00:03:07,014
and I'm going get
you an ambulance.

00:03:07,081 --> 00:03:09,016
I'm fine, honest, I am.

00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:10,818
Okay.
Really, it's nothing.

00:03:10,885 --> 00:03:12,019
At least, can I just...

00:03:12,086 --> 00:03:14,889
I'm going to call the police
and make a police report.

00:03:14,955 --> 00:03:17,358
I'd really rather
you not do that.

00:03:17,424 --> 00:03:18,692
I'll tell you why.

00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:21,629
I don't, uh,
I don't have any insurance.

00:03:21,695 --> 00:03:22,997
No, no, no.

00:03:23,063 --> 00:03:24,465
That's okay. I do.

00:03:24,532 --> 00:03:27,134
Look, it was my fault;
I know that.

00:03:27,201 --> 00:03:30,337
And that is exactly
what I will tell them.

00:03:30,404 --> 00:03:33,173
My dad just said,
if I ever got into an accident

00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,009
that I had to make
a police report.

00:03:35,075 --> 00:03:38,245
Can I tell you
something, sweetheart?

00:03:38,312 --> 00:03:40,881
You're drunk
right now, okay?

00:03:40,948 --> 00:03:42,550
And you hit me.

00:03:42,616 --> 00:03:44,218
Now, that's a DUI,

00:03:44,285 --> 00:03:46,820
and if you call the police,

00:03:46,887 --> 00:03:48,289
they're going to take
your license away,

00:03:48,355 --> 00:03:50,090
and they're going
to throw you in jail.

00:03:50,157 --> 00:03:52,660
Now, what I'd like you to do
is get in your car,

00:03:52,726 --> 00:03:55,229
drive yourself home and forget
that this ever happened.

00:03:55,296 --> 00:03:57,831
Can you do that?

00:03:57,898 --> 00:03:59,433
I'm fine.

00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,502
Go on.

00:04:01,569 --> 00:04:03,671
I'm fine,
honest, I promise.

00:04:03,737 --> 00:04:05,739
You go.

00:04:09,443 --> 00:04:11,445

Her name is
Ally Sullivan.

00:04:25,025 --> 00:04:27,061
She's
the registered owner.

00:04:27,127 --> 00:04:29,964
Patrol unit investigating
the wreck, found the body.

00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:33,133
So far, we have nothing
on the other car.

00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,736
Where's the nearest
traffic camera?

00:04:35,803 --> 00:04:36,537
Four blocks north.

00:04:36,604 --> 00:04:38,339
We've been
pulling bodies

00:04:38,405 --> 00:04:40,708
out of this neighborhood
twice a month, it seems like.

00:04:40,774 --> 00:04:42,776
I think that's actually
an improvement.

00:04:42,843 --> 00:04:44,678
Yeah.

00:04:44,745 --> 00:04:45,913
Well, it's a cold night.

00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:48,349
I'm going to get you
some coffee and donuts.

00:04:56,991 --> 00:05:00,160
Nine-nine-nine...
five-five-two.

00:05:00,227 --> 00:05:02,596
Most people would have
called 911.

00:05:04,632 --> 00:05:07,134
Well, there's a seat-belt
contusion on her shoulder.

00:05:07,201 --> 00:05:09,236
So... she survives the crash.

00:05:09,303 --> 00:05:11,005
She gets out of the car,

00:05:11,071 --> 00:05:12,840
She dies on the street?

00:05:12,907 --> 00:05:14,675
Internal injuries maybe.

00:05:14,742 --> 00:05:16,610
Maybe.

00:05:16,677 --> 00:05:20,047
How'd the car end up
in this position?

00:05:20,114 --> 00:05:22,116
It looks like
she caused the wreck.

no matter
how pretty are today,

00:07:58,592 --> 00:08:03,097

<i>She always did the right thing;</i>

Whoever was in the other car...

00:08:19,814 --> 00:08:24,518
I don't care why they left.

00:08:24,585 --> 00:08:26,454
All they had to do
was call an ambulance

00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,689
instead of leaving her
there to die.

00:08:30,524 --> 00:08:33,327
ROBBINS:
C.O.D. was
hyper-extension
of the neck

00:08:33,394 --> 00:08:36,197
with a rotational snap,
resulting in a ruptured

00:08:36,263 --> 00:08:38,165
vertebral artery,
mid-cervical.

00:08:38,232 --> 00:08:39,400
Mid?
Yeah.

00:08:39,467 --> 00:08:41,802
Most MVA's break down low
or up high, don't they?

00:08:41,869 --> 00:08:43,804
That's why I don't think
the accident did it.

00:08:43,871 --> 00:08:47,174
The injury was
more consistent
with a stranglehold.

00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:53,781
ROBBINS:
<i>The head was rapidly twisted</i>
<i>relative to the spinal column.</i>

00:08:53,848 --> 00:08:56,183
She would have been
dead within a minute.

00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,653
Whoever killed this poor kid
knew what they were doing.

00:09:15,436 --> 00:09:16,971
I don't like Gruyere, Daddy.

00:09:18,973 --> 00:09:22,143
No Gruyere in it, sweetie;
I promise.

00:09:22,209 --> 00:09:23,878
All right, egg me.

00:09:27,381 --> 00:09:30,251
Hello, Mommy.
I'm cooking.

00:09:30,318 --> 00:09:31,252
I see that.

00:09:31,319 --> 00:09:32,386
Good morning, honey.

00:09:32,453 --> 00:09:33,654
Morning.

00:09:33,721 --> 00:09:36,590
Yeah, well, the jury's
still out on that

00:09:36,657 --> 00:09:38,693
as far you're concerned.

00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:40,127
You must have had
quite a night.

00:09:40,194 --> 00:09:43,097
Yeah. I guess
I lost track of time.

00:09:44,765 --> 00:09:46,233
That Joey's a dog.

00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:49,003
If you don't watch out, he's
going to get you into trouble.

00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:50,304
I kind of doubt that.

00:09:50,371 --> 00:09:51,405
I wouldn't worry, though.

00:09:51,472 --> 00:09:53,908
It won't happen again.

00:09:53,974 --> 00:09:55,743
These days, I'm all
about you, baby.

00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:57,311
I'm the baby.

00:09:57,378 --> 00:10:02,683
I know. I know, but daddies
can have more than one baby.

00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,684
Yeah,
pretty talk, talk, talk.

00:10:03,751 --> 00:10:04,685
Here, wait, wait.

Try this, try this.

00:10:06,053 --> 00:10:07,455
Maddy made them.

00:10:09,457 --> 00:10:11,459
Mm, it's delicious.

00:10:11,525 --> 00:10:12,526
Very good.

I'm glad you shaved.

00:10:16,497 --> 00:10:18,199
I barely recognized you

It's not like that.

00:10:41,822 --> 00:10:43,024
It's not like that at all.

Can I get a soda, too?

00:10:54,368 --> 00:10:56,437
I'm, like, parched.

00:10:56,504 --> 00:10:59,140
You want to tell me what your
fingerprints are doing on a cup

in a dead girl's car?

00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:02,109
Uh, yeah, yeah.

00:11:02,176 --> 00:11:03,711
I was out at Jet...

00:11:03,778 --> 00:11:05,713
( <i>over microphone</i> ):
I was kind of faded, I guess.

00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:08,382
Um, I bumped into Ally,

00:11:09,617 --> 00:11:11,319
So that's what you were
doing on Harmon Road?

00:11:11,385 --> 00:11:13,487
Yeah, Ally don't care
where I live; she's a cool girl.

00:11:13,554 --> 00:11:14,588
You were close?

00:11:14,655 --> 00:11:16,424
Oh, yeah.

00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:18,125

No, look, we really

00:11:27,001 --> 00:11:28,602
But we would text
all the time.

00:11:28,669 --> 00:11:30,805
That's, like, when
you use your cell phone

00:11:30,871 --> 00:11:32,473
to send, like, you know, words.

00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,742
Yeah. I know what
text messaging is.

00:11:34,809 --> 00:11:36,143
Fine.

00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:37,712
Sorry.

Look, I'm telling you
the truth,

00:11:40,648 --> 00:11:42,149
you really couldn't
get Ally on the phone,

00:11:42,216 --> 00:11:43,651
it's all texting with her.

00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,355
You want me to pee into a cup?
You want my underwear?

00:11:47,421 --> 00:11:48,356
Whatever you want, you got it,

00:11:48,422 --> 00:11:49,991
cause I didn't kill Ally.

00:11:50,057 --> 00:11:51,292
BRASS ( <i>over microphone</i> ):
I'll tell you what I want.

00:11:51,359 --> 00:11:52,460
I want you to write down

00:11:52,526 --> 00:11:54,028
exactly where you were
last night and when.

00:11:54,095 --> 00:11:54,929
Think you can handle that?

00:11:54,996 --> 00:11:56,964
HALL:
Can I get a soda?

00:11:57,031 --> 00:11:58,466
BRASS:
Shut up and write.

00:12:01,202 --> 00:12:02,837
HODGES:
<i>Paint scrapings</i>

00:12:02,903 --> 00:12:04,271
from your vic's bumper
are consistent

00:12:04,338 --> 00:12:06,440
with a '91 to '96
blue Ford.

00:12:06,507 --> 00:12:09,343
So that narrows it down
to a few thousand cars

00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:11,345
in the greater
Las Vegas area.

00:12:11,412 --> 00:12:14,582
Yeah, but the car you're looking
for is also a piece of crap.

00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:16,350
Make and model I get,

00:12:16,417 --> 00:12:17,918
but unless you have
a new test

00:12:17,985 --> 00:12:20,021
that quantifies
"crappiness"...

00:12:20,087 --> 00:12:21,222
Actually, take a look.

00:12:24,392 --> 00:12:27,328
SIDLE:
Firebird's on the left,
blue Ford on the right.

00:12:27,395 --> 00:12:29,563
What's the gray-blue
in the middle?

00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:32,833
A mixture of Rustoleum
and house paint.

00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,802
The killer's car had
exposed primer.

00:12:34,869 --> 00:12:35,870
Swanky.

00:12:37,038 --> 00:12:38,606
( <i>door opens</i> )

00:12:38,673 --> 00:12:42,209
Might have found a few letters
from the license plate.

00:12:42,276 --> 00:12:43,577
"Y-K-A."

00:12:43,644 --> 00:12:44,578
You found a witness?

00:12:44,645 --> 00:12:45,579
No.

00:12:45,646 --> 00:12:46,981
Just behavior.

00:12:47,048 --> 00:12:48,215
But according to
Ally Sullivan's father,

00:12:48,282 --> 00:12:50,284
she was the type of girl
that might have noticed

00:12:50,351 --> 00:12:52,153
the license plate
of the car that hit her.

00:12:52,219 --> 00:12:54,288
And according to her
good friend,

00:12:54,355 --> 00:12:55,423
she preferred

00:12:55,489 --> 00:12:58,225
text messaging
to leaving voice messages.

00:12:58,292 --> 00:12:59,360
She was dying, right?

00:12:59,427 --> 00:13:00,695
Disoriented?

00:13:00,761 --> 00:13:03,197
I don't know, but maybe
she thought she was texting

00:13:03,264 --> 00:13:05,266
when in fact she just
dialing her phone.

00:13:06,567 --> 00:13:14,875
( <i>phone keys beeping</i> )

00:13:14,942 --> 00:13:17,545
That's a bit of a long shot.

00:13:17,611 --> 00:13:19,413
Yeah.

00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,481
It's still a shot.

00:13:27,188 --> 00:13:28,889
NEWSPERSON ( <i>on TV</i> ):
Good evening, I'm Paula Francis.

00:13:28,956 --> 00:13:31,192
A weekend of sordid crimes

00:13:31,258 --> 00:13:32,960
has Las Vegas Police
working double-time.

00:13:33,027 --> 00:13:34,962
MAN:
Come on, admit it.
Come on.

00:13:35,029 --> 00:13:36,330
That's a little smile.

00:13:36,397 --> 00:13:37,465
Come on...

00:13:37,531 --> 00:13:39,066
Huh? You know
you're crazy about me.

00:13:39,133 --> 00:13:40,334
I want you to come back.

00:13:40,401 --> 00:13:41,769
As soon as you're done,
come back.

00:13:41,836 --> 00:13:43,738
Joey? Joey?

00:13:43,804 --> 00:13:45,072
Hey.

00:13:45,139 --> 00:13:48,242
You don't hit on a cocktail
waitress <i>at</i> the bar.

00:13:48,309 --> 00:13:50,511
Go sit at a table,
then she's got a reason

00:13:50,578 --> 00:13:52,380
to come over and serve you,
and it's less obvious.

00:13:52,446 --> 00:13:54,515
Hold on. Wait, wait.

00:13:54,582 --> 00:13:56,384
The househusband's giving me
tips on women?

00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:58,886
I married a cocktail waitress.

00:13:58,953 --> 00:14:01,088
Janice-- cocktail?

00:14:01,155 --> 00:14:02,723
This crappy little joint
in Cleveland.

00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,058
Really?
Mm-hmm.

00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:06,060
I'm not looking
to marry this
this broad.

00:14:06,127 --> 00:14:07,962
Although, she might
think so.

00:14:08,029 --> 00:14:09,030
At least for tonight.

00:14:09,096 --> 00:14:10,164
Ah.

00:14:10,231 --> 00:14:12,433
Joe, you're, like, 40-something,
right.

00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,335
Shouldn't you be toning
it down a little?

00:14:14,402 --> 00:14:15,636
Tone it down?

00:14:15,703 --> 00:14:17,772
Karl, I'm looking
to take it up a notch.

00:14:17,838 --> 00:14:19,774
I got, like, ten
more years of fun left

00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,809
and my wingman's
got a curfew.

00:14:21,876 --> 00:14:22,977
No?

00:14:23,044 --> 00:14:25,680
Why'd you bail out
so early last night?

00:14:25,746 --> 00:14:27,381
I missed my family.

00:14:27,448 --> 00:14:29,417
You're so sweet.

00:14:29,483 --> 00:14:31,485
You should work
for Hallmark.

00:14:31,552 --> 00:14:34,088
I'll send them my resume.

00:14:34,155 --> 00:14:39,327
MAN:
It wasn't the smell that got
my attention, you know?

00:14:39,393 --> 00:14:42,029
Usually when I find a body,

00:14:42,096 --> 00:14:48,502
it's, uh, it's very,
um, raunchy.

00:14:48,569 --> 00:14:51,138
It's called "decomp,"
in case you're interested.

00:14:51,205 --> 00:14:53,674
I'll remember that
for next time.

00:14:53,741 --> 00:14:56,444
If it wasn't the smell,
why did you check the room?

00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:59,680
Rent is due
every week.

00:14:59,747 --> 00:15:01,949
What's his name?

00:15:02,016 --> 00:15:04,318
We ask for cash, not names.

00:15:05,853 --> 00:15:09,824
We take who the casinos won't.

00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:11,292
Someone's got to do it.

00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,960
You touch or move anything?

00:15:13,027 --> 00:15:15,162
First thing I did
was call you guys.

00:15:15,229 --> 00:15:17,198
Got you on speed dial.

00:15:17,264 --> 00:15:19,000
And finally, in local crime,

00:15:19,066 --> 00:15:21,268
an update
on yesterday's tragic death

00:15:21,335 --> 00:15:23,971
of Vegas party girl
Ally Sullivan.

00:15:24,038 --> 00:15:25,706
Police are still examining
all the evidence

00:15:25,773 --> 00:15:27,708
from the gruesome crime scene.

00:15:27,775 --> 00:15:30,711
Detectives tell Eyewitness News
they have little to work with.

00:15:30,778 --> 00:15:32,646
And something that stumps them:

00:15:32,713 --> 00:15:34,248
What was the motive
for the killer

00:15:34,315 --> 00:15:37,518
in this violent end
to a young and beautifu life?

00:15:37,585 --> 00:15:38,519
REPORTER:
Mr. Sullivan,

00:15:38,586 --> 00:15:40,154
when was the last time
you saw her alive?

00:15:40,221 --> 00:15:41,789
What are you people thinking?

00:15:41,856 --> 00:15:44,659
Think I'm going to say
something magical,

00:15:44,725 --> 00:15:47,361
bring Ally back to me?

00:15:47,428 --> 00:15:49,563
I'm not talking to you people.

00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:51,465
Mr. Sullivan,
what was your
daughter doing

00:15:51,532 --> 00:15:53,234
in that section of town?
You think it was drug-related?

00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:56,037
ANCHOR:
Police are hoping that passersby
or other eyewitnesses

00:15:56,103 --> 00:15:57,905
will come forward
to help the investigation

00:15:57,972 --> 00:15:59,540
of this terrible murder.

00:15:59,607 --> 00:16:02,376
If you have information
that might help police,

00:16:02,443 --> 00:16:05,613
you are urged to call
LVPD at the toll-free number

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,048
on the screen.

00:16:14,989 --> 00:16:16,991
Control, this is
Detective Curtis.

00:16:17,058 --> 00:16:20,561
I'm at 1773 Twain,
Riviera Suites.

00:16:20,628 --> 00:16:24,165
I got a 419. I need CSI.

00:16:27,999 --> 00:16:30,935
You know, I think I've been
called out to this place before.

00:16:31,002 --> 00:16:33,204
I think I've processed
this very room before.

00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:35,573
Liver temp is close to ambient.

00:16:39,143 --> 00:16:41,512
But lividity is fixed.

00:16:43,214 --> 00:16:46,951
And rigidity starting to pass.

00:16:47,018 --> 00:16:50,021
So he's been dead
for at least 20 hours.

00:17:04,669 --> 00:17:06,303
".380 Auto."

00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:08,005
That's Federal ammo.

00:17:08,072 --> 00:17:10,775
.380s make a lot of noise.

00:17:10,841 --> 00:17:12,977
It's odd that
no one heard
anything,

00:17:13,044 --> 00:17:15,112
even in a dump like this.

00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:16,981
"Walther PPK."

00:17:19,984 --> 00:17:22,019
Two shots in the body,
one to the head.

00:17:22,086 --> 00:17:25,056
Sounds like
a professional hit to me.

00:17:26,223 --> 00:17:28,159
Looks like the killer used
Armor All.

00:17:28,225 --> 00:17:29,760
The gun is clean.

00:17:29,827 --> 00:17:31,028
Looks like the victim
was doing

00:17:31,095 --> 00:17:32,029
a little cleaning of his own.

00:17:32,096 --> 00:17:33,664
He was a 12 Stepper.

00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,803
Trying to make amends.

00:17:38,869 --> 00:17:40,638
He was on step number nine.

00:17:40,705 --> 00:17:44,642
Apparently
not enough.

00:17:44,709 --> 00:17:48,312
Well, it's pretty
obvious he came in
through the window.

00:17:52,049 --> 00:17:54,852
Whew. One thing's for sure,

00:17:54,919 --> 00:17:58,756
this killer's lugging around
some pretty big dogs.

00:18:43,234 --> 00:18:47,605
Oh. Hey, Grissom,
I just ID'd those fibers

00:18:47,672 --> 00:18:50,341
you found
on Ally Sullivan's necklace.

00:18:50,408 --> 00:18:52,777
They were not from
her jacket or her dress.

00:18:52,843 --> 00:18:55,246
They're made of lambskin
and rabbit fur.

00:18:55,313 --> 00:18:56,647
You know, just between
you and me,

00:18:56,714 --> 00:18:57,882
I used to carry
a rabbit's foot.

00:18:57,948 --> 00:18:59,250
I mean,
I'm not superstitious.

00:18:59,317 --> 00:19:00,918
It's just, I figure
why take the chance?

00:19:00,985 --> 00:19:04,889
You know, as a kid,
my grandfather used
to have a rabbit farm.

00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:09,427
Is this our Ford Taurus?

00:19:09,493 --> 00:19:11,028
Once upon a time.

00:19:11,095 --> 00:19:12,997
Told you it was
a piece of crap.

00:19:13,064 --> 00:19:15,099
The vehicle was abandoned
near a junkyard

00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:17,134
off Boulder Highway.

00:19:17,201 --> 00:19:18,369
By the time they checked
the plates,

00:19:18,436 --> 00:19:20,338
it was already in the crusher.

00:19:22,006 --> 00:19:23,908
Plates and paint are a match
to your BOLO.

00:19:25,509 --> 00:19:28,045
Did Brass run those tags?

00:19:28,112 --> 00:19:32,049
Yeah, it was last registered
to a Betty Grinly in Henderson.

00:19:32,116 --> 00:19:34,418
She passed away last month.

00:19:35,686 --> 00:19:38,589
Gasoline. They torched it.

00:19:44,628 --> 00:19:47,431
So he burns the evidence
near a junkyard

00:19:47,498 --> 00:19:50,434
so that they'll find it
and dispose of it. Clever.

00:19:50,501 --> 00:19:52,670
Looks like we're dealing
with a professional.

00:19:52,737 --> 00:19:54,038
Professional what, though?

00:19:54,105 --> 00:19:56,073
Ally Sullivan was killed
over a fender bender.

00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,608
You're right.

00:19:57,675 --> 00:19:59,343
He probably just
loved his car

00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:01,012
and has a really
bad temper.

00:20:08,719 --> 00:20:10,154
And he likes pineapples.

00:20:13,257 --> 00:20:18,295
Ah, yeah, I remember
that Taurus.

00:20:18,362 --> 00:20:19,563
Cheap and reliable.

00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:20,865
That combo always sells.

00:20:20,931 --> 00:20:23,601
Could you give me a description
of the person who bought it?

00:20:23,668 --> 00:20:27,104
Honey, I'm not even sure
I can tell what you look like.

00:20:27,171 --> 00:20:29,173
All I remember is

00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,307
he came off the bus...

00:20:31,942 --> 00:20:35,946
<i>he walked right up</i>
<i>with a big wad of cash.</i>

00:20:36,013 --> 00:20:38,316
I put him in that Taurus,

00:20:38,382 --> 00:20:40,951
and 15 minutes later,
he drove off the lot.

00:20:41,018 --> 00:20:43,354
Did you get
a transaction record?

00:20:43,421 --> 00:20:48,059
Let's see. Taurus, Taurus,
Taurus, Taurus...

00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:50,328
Ah, here you go.

00:20:54,765 --> 00:20:57,201
This is for
a '99 Jeep Cherokee.

00:21:01,706 --> 00:21:03,407
It sure is.

00:21:06,043 --> 00:21:07,311
Um, hold it.

00:21:07,378 --> 00:21:08,579
It's over here.

00:21:16,153 --> 00:21:17,888
How's that one look?

00:21:17,955 --> 00:21:20,224
Not so great.

00:22:08,205 --> 00:22:10,341
( <i>beeps</i> )

00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,399
The coroner's bullets
matched the Walther,

00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:16,902
but Bobby found
an additional striated mark

00:22:16,969 --> 00:22:19,037
on the O-jive,
so he went back to the gun.

00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:20,439
There was threading
inside the muzzle.

00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:24,443
Killer used a silencer.

00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:38,123
Slightest imperfection
in the barrel

00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,425
of a silencer could explain

00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:42,094
these scratches on the bullet.

00:22:42,161 --> 00:22:44,596
Oh. Also explains
why no one heard anything.

00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:46,465
But

00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:48,667
leave the gun,
take the silencer?

00:22:48,734 --> 00:22:50,502
Well, you can't legally
buy a silencer,

00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:51,937
and those things are hard
to make.

00:22:52,004 --> 00:22:53,939
If the silencer was homemade,
we might have been able

00:22:54,006 --> 00:22:55,974
to match the killer's
tool marks.

00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,643
Assuming we ever find this guy.

00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,645
I don't know who would go
through this much trouble

00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,480
to kill a nobody like Nash.

00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:04,049

Hey, people, Amanda Congdon
from rocketboom.com

00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:33,779
with this week's creep report.

00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:35,481
If you were planning on
checking out

00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:37,983
that new club, Bubbles,
down near Harmon and Twain,

00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:39,985
you might want to think twice,

00:23:40,052 --> 00:23:42,721
because the corpses are really
piling up down there.

00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:45,824
The body of Clayton Nash vas
found just two blocks away

00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:47,860
from the site
of Ally Sullivan's murder,

00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,696
and the killer's still
at large.

00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:53,632
Is this just another
crime spree,

00:23:53,699 --> 00:23:56,535
or the work
of one deranged maniac?

00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:58,003
Don't ask the cops.

00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,538
They don't have a clue.

00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:03,742
Remember, Amanda warned you.

00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:05,043
JANICE:
Carl?

00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,378
Mm.
What are you doing?

00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,013
Oh.
Not even ready
for dinner.

00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,381
I was checking
our stocks.

00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,183
Well, you're not wearing that
to the Eiffel Tower.

00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,051
I'll throw some clothes on.

00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:15,420
Hurry up. My mom's waiting
for Maddy.

00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:16,889
I don't want
to lose that table.

00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:19,024

Yeah, I'm a

00:25:49,314 --> 00:25:50,516
Now, is there any chance,

00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:52,251
any chance at all,
that you remember this guy?

00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:54,419
I know it's not
the best picture.

00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:56,421
Oh, yeah.

00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:59,858
I let him out on stop "E" around
4:30 day before yesterday.

00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:03,462
Oh, you know, you get hundreds
of people on and off
your bus every day.

00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:06,131
We got to be sure--
are you sure you remember him?

00:26:06,198 --> 00:26:08,267
I look at every face
that steps on my ride.

00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:10,369
I saw the movie <i>Speed--</i>
I'm not gonna be hijacked.

00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:13,071
Well, you know, actually <i>Speed,</i>
it... it wasn't hijacked,

00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:14,473
it was wired to explode.

00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,375
Whatever.

00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:19,378
Well, all right.
What exactly do you
remember about him?

00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:21,480
He paid in cash,
told me to keep the change--

00:26:21,547 --> 00:26:22,781
everybody else uses a bus pass.

00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:25,517
He was a real gentleman--
tucked-in shirt,

00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,853
new shoes...

00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,987
Nice smell.

00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:31,390
Kind of stands out
on my route.

00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:33,725
So I guess you remember
where you picked him up, then?

00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:36,728
He came walking out of
the desert like Moses himself.

00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:38,864
SANDERS:
So the bus driver said

00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:40,799
the guy got on here?

00:26:40,866 --> 00:26:43,068
You sure this is
a working stop?

00:26:43,135 --> 00:26:45,971
You know, the Cat bus stops here
59 times a day.

00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:48,006
SANDERS:
For what?
Construction workers,

00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:49,641
hikers,

00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:50,909
migrants.

00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:52,311
The name on the
driver's license

00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:55,581
was fake, but
the picture's
got to be real.

00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:59,418
I'm gonna go... wave it
around the neighborhood.

00:26:59,485 --> 00:27:00,719

how'd he get here?

00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:09,528
The same way they did.

00:27:32,999 --> 00:27:35,168
SANDERS:
Every time I come
to the desert,

00:27:35,235 --> 00:27:37,270
I see porno mags.

Who brings spankables out here?

00:27:39,139 --> 00:27:41,908
STOKES:
It's probably just trash

00:27:41,975 --> 00:27:43,576
blown in from off the street.

00:27:43,643 --> 00:27:45,312
Nobody throws away porn.

00:27:45,378 --> 00:27:47,213
They're like heirlooms.

00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:50,150
Passed on down
the family tree.

00:27:59,125 --> 00:28:00,081
Hey, Greg.

00:28:00,165 --> 00:28:01,633
Come here and check this out.

00:28:03,235 --> 00:28:06,538
A single set of ATV tracks
goes off the trail

00:28:06,605 --> 00:28:09,408
back there into here--
killer could've dumped the ATV

00:28:09,475 --> 00:28:10,876
and then got on the bus.

00:28:17,683 --> 00:28:22,087
Whoever was here
had some big shoes.

00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:30,095
Not necessarily big feet.

00:28:30,162 --> 00:28:32,030
Multiple socks.

00:28:32,097 --> 00:28:33,599
Another precaution
to cover your tracks.

00:28:39,705 --> 00:28:41,907
Assuming it's our guy.

00:28:41,974 --> 00:28:43,275
STOKES:
I'd say

00:28:43,342 --> 00:28:45,010
it's our guy.

00:28:45,077 --> 00:28:48,080
And I think he just
gave us the finger.

00:29:02,539 --> 00:29:04,641
I have an update for you.

00:29:04,708 --> 00:29:06,910
The burned gloves
that Nick submitted

00:29:06,977 --> 00:29:09,646
are lambskin
lined with rabbit's fur.

00:29:09,713 --> 00:29:11,715
They're consistent
with the fibers found

00:29:11,782 --> 00:29:13,483
in Ally Sullivan's necklace.

00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:15,118
Good.

00:29:15,185 --> 00:29:17,187
Thanks.
Mm-hmm.

00:29:45,649 --> 00:29:49,619
WILLOWS:
I'm guessing that Clayton Nash
had a record.

00:29:49,686 --> 00:29:50,921
1985, aiding
and abetting,

00:29:50,987 --> 00:29:53,557
extortion in '87,
armed robbery in '92,

00:29:53,623 --> 00:29:56,393
assault in '95,
uh, loan sharking
the same year.

00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,762
I get the drift.
But, uh,

00:29:58,829 --> 00:30:00,731
take a look at this--
it's FBI surveillance.

00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:06,069
What is this, summer camp?
Well, not the kind

00:30:06,136 --> 00:30:08,638
you want to send your kid to--
they're bank robbers.

00:30:08,705 --> 00:30:11,908
All of them?
Apparently, Nash
and his buddies

00:30:11,975 --> 00:30:13,310
would get together every year,

00:30:13,377 --> 00:30:16,046
talk shop, hire hookers,
play flag football.

00:30:16,113 --> 00:30:19,950
Nash did mostly grunt work--
driver, lookout.

00:30:20,017 --> 00:30:21,151
Never handled the cash.

00:30:21,218 --> 00:30:24,287
He got busted
in an armored car heist

00:30:24,354 --> 00:30:26,423
in Ohio ten years ago.

00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:29,426
Testified against practically
everyone he'd ever worked with.

00:30:29,493 --> 00:30:30,560
Well, that certainly explains

00:30:30,627 --> 00:30:32,596
why someone would want
to kill him.

00:30:32,663 --> 00:30:33,997
Most of those people
in the picture

00:30:34,064 --> 00:30:35,098
are either dead or in prison.

00:30:35,165 --> 00:30:36,767
Who isn't?

00:30:36,833 --> 00:30:37,868
Give me a Heine, please.

00:30:37,934 --> 00:30:39,469

me, let me tell ya.

00:30:41,805 --> 00:30:43,040
Really blasted my quads.

Wanna?

00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:50,213
Let's pretend... that

and let's pretend
we're in <i>your</i> office,

No particular order.

00:31:09,533 --> 00:31:11,868
DMV license blanks?
What is this?

00:31:11,935 --> 00:31:13,337
No questions.

00:31:14,705 --> 00:31:16,239
Laminating machine,
blank bar code labels.

00:31:16,306 --> 00:31:19,609
What are you doing?
What makes you think
I can even get this stuff?

00:31:19,676 --> 00:31:21,611
I know the guys
you represent.

00:31:21,678 --> 00:31:22,913
I'm one of 'em.

00:31:22,979 --> 00:31:25,549
I need the stuff fast.

00:31:25,615 --> 00:31:27,184
Don't let me down.

00:32:11,128 --> 00:32:13,397
GRISSOM:
There was no reason
to connect the two murders

00:32:13,463 --> 00:32:16,266
until ballistics matched
the silencer we found
in the desert with

00:32:16,333 --> 00:32:17,934
the gun you found
at the Riviera Suites.

00:32:18,001 --> 00:32:19,336
Two murders, same killer.

00:32:19,403 --> 00:32:21,071
SIDLE:
Here's how we think
things went down.

00:32:21,138 --> 00:32:23,240
The killer drove
his ATV into the desert,

00:32:23,306 --> 00:32:28,078
concealed it in the brush,
takes a bus to a used car lot
and buys a blue Taurus.

00:32:28,145 --> 00:32:30,380
BROWN:
Then he drives
to the apartment,

00:32:30,447 --> 00:32:32,516
puts a cap in Clayton Nash,

00:32:32,582 --> 00:32:35,552
gets into his car
and drives away, free and clear.

00:32:35,619 --> 00:32:37,354
It's a good plan, well executed.

00:32:37,421 --> 00:32:38,655
Yeah, right up until the point

00:32:38,722 --> 00:32:40,123
that Ally Sullivan
smashed into his car.

00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:43,026
Collateral damage--
he killed her

00:32:43,093 --> 00:32:44,728
so she couldn't
identify him.

00:32:44,795 --> 00:32:47,097
BROWN:
Okay, that all sounds great.

00:32:47,164 --> 00:32:48,598
How do we find the guy?

00:32:48,665 --> 00:32:50,400
WILLOWS:
We know his original target,
Clayton Nash.

00:32:50,467 --> 00:32:53,837
Small-time hood who gave up
a lot of his big-time cronies.

00:32:53,904 --> 00:32:55,605
He's got a list of enemies.

00:32:55,672 --> 00:32:58,108
How many guys got convicted
off Nash's testimony?

00:32:58,175 --> 00:32:59,509
Seven.

00:32:59,576 --> 00:33:01,144
Three of them
are still in prison.

00:33:01,211 --> 00:33:03,480
One is dead,
one is out on parole,

00:33:03,547 --> 00:33:05,916
and two served their time
and are now out.

00:33:05,982 --> 00:33:07,684
So we have
three potential killers

00:33:07,751 --> 00:33:09,886
and nothing to tie them
to either crime scene.

00:33:09,953 --> 00:33:11,488
SIDLE:
Not quite.

00:33:11,555 --> 00:33:13,557
I ruled out most
of the prints

00:33:13,623 --> 00:33:15,258
from Ally Sullivan's car--

00:33:15,325 --> 00:33:17,427
the vic, the father,
her boyfriend--

00:33:17,494 --> 00:33:21,164
but there were a few
unidentified partials.

00:33:23,734 --> 00:33:25,235
It's not enough detail
to run through AFIS?

00:33:25,302 --> 00:33:26,470
GRISSOM:
Well, if this guy

00:33:26,536 --> 00:33:27,704
is a major case felon,

00:33:27,771 --> 00:33:29,339
then his prints are definitely
in the system.

00:33:29,406 --> 00:33:31,308
I dusted every inch
of that apartment window.

00:33:31,375 --> 00:33:32,709
He never took off his gloves.

00:33:43,253 --> 00:33:44,721
( <i>grunts</i> )

00:34:22,996 --> 00:34:24,664
You going somewhere?

00:34:29,616 --> 00:34:31,541
The fake ID cards?!

00:34:31,608 --> 00:34:32,809
The staying out all night,

00:34:32,876 --> 00:34:36,116
and then this mysterious
ATV ride in the desert.

00:34:36,116 --> 00:34:37,984
You gave me the ATV
for my birthday.

00:34:38,051 --> 00:34:39,119
I ride it because I love you.

00:34:39,186 --> 00:34:41,087
Yeah, at 3:00 in the morning?

00:34:41,154 --> 00:34:42,155
Yeah.

00:34:42,222 --> 00:34:43,690
Uh-uh.

00:34:43,757 --> 00:34:45,292
You're planning a job.

00:34:45,358 --> 00:34:46,860
I'm not planning a job!

00:34:46,927 --> 00:34:48,829
You know
I don't do that anymore.

00:34:48,895 --> 00:34:51,031
You're a liar, Karl.

00:34:51,097 --> 00:34:54,000
You're lying!
Honey, listen-- honey!

00:34:57,437 --> 00:35:00,106
Janice, look...

00:35:02,042 --> 00:35:03,877
I had to take care
of something.

00:35:03,944 --> 00:35:06,713
And what's that
supposed to mean?

00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:10,550
I killed Clayton Nash.

00:35:14,087 --> 00:35:15,689
You even think about Maddy?

00:35:15,755 --> 00:35:17,591
Your daughter?

00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:19,759
You promised...

00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:21,261
on her life,
you promised!

00:35:21,328 --> 00:35:23,263
No more robberies!

00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:26,099
I don't do robberies anymore.

00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:27,601
Now you just kill people.

00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:29,436
He was a rat.

00:35:29,503 --> 00:35:30,937
Oh, Karl.

00:35:32,305 --> 00:35:34,808
All the waiting.

00:35:34,875 --> 00:35:38,078
All the maneuvering,
the lying.

00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:42,616
I did it.

00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:45,418
And I did it for us,
for this family.

00:35:45,485 --> 00:35:47,687
I kept money in our wallets.

00:35:47,754 --> 00:35:52,792
I invested it, so all you had
to do was watch football on TV.

00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:54,728
And Nash was the reason.

00:35:54,794 --> 00:35:58,899
The reason that you had to hide
the money and live on the run.

00:35:58,965 --> 00:36:00,634
I never got caught!

00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,868
And I never
would've got caught,

00:36:01,935 --> 00:36:03,804
except for that...
that lousy junkie

00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:07,440
who gave me up.

00:36:07,507 --> 00:36:10,310
I only had one rule:
you never talk!

00:36:10,377 --> 00:36:12,112
And he talked.

00:36:12,179 --> 00:36:14,047
And you jeopardized
everything we have

00:36:14,114 --> 00:36:18,952
for some scumbag that
nobody gives a damn about.

00:36:19,019 --> 00:36:21,655
Janice, he called me
four weeks ago.

00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:23,590
He said,
"I'm in town for a while.

00:36:23,657 --> 00:36:24,991
Maybe we could we get together."

00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:26,493
He had something to tell me.

00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,594
Tell me what?

00:36:27,661 --> 00:36:29,830
"I'm sorry?

00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:33,934
I'm sorry I stole seven
years of your life."

00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,071
I-I couldn't let it go.

00:36:42,375 --> 00:36:47,214
Oh, God, he had it coming.

00:36:48,381 --> 00:36:50,684
And you were
careful, right?

00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:57,090
So what's with the fake IDs?

00:36:59,526 --> 00:37:01,194
Karl?

00:37:01,261 --> 00:37:03,730
You don't make mistakes.

00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:08,935
I didn't.

00:37:09,002 --> 00:37:10,570
Somebody else did.

00:37:12,706 --> 00:37:16,376
A girl named Ally Sullivan.

00:37:17,911 --> 00:37:22,048
The... The girl on the TV?

00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:25,785
Oh, Karl!

00:37:27,254 --> 00:37:30,557
Oh, God, she was just a kid!

00:37:30,624 --> 00:37:32,826
She crashed
into my car

00:37:32,893 --> 00:37:35,028
right after I did Nash.

00:37:35,095 --> 00:37:37,097
She was gonna call the cops.

00:37:37,164 --> 00:37:38,565
I had to do it.

00:37:41,368 --> 00:37:43,537
I had to.

00:37:46,206 --> 00:37:48,575
I want you to go up the stairs.

00:37:48,642 --> 00:37:50,377
I want you to kiss Maddy.

00:37:50,443 --> 00:37:53,547
I want you to tell her
that you love her...

00:37:53,613 --> 00:37:55,448
and I want you to get out
of this house.

00:37:58,018 --> 00:37:59,252
WILLOWS:
<i>Karl Cooper.</i>

00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:01,154
<i>At age 19, he was</i>

00:38:01,221 --> 00:38:02,455
an Army Ranger.

00:38:02,522 --> 00:38:05,258
By 42, he was one
of the most successful

00:38:05,325 --> 00:38:07,394
bank robbers
in U.S. history.

00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:09,029
He pulled off dozens
of heists,

00:38:09,095 --> 00:38:10,764
going back two decades,

00:38:10,831 --> 00:38:12,632
all without killing
a single person,

00:38:12,699 --> 00:38:17,337
and he was known
to his bank-robbing
buddies as "Red."

00:38:17,404 --> 00:38:19,005
He doesn't have red hair.

00:38:19,072 --> 00:38:20,440
Well, he got the nickname

00:38:20,507 --> 00:38:23,109
because he was always
in debt... "in the red."

00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:25,045
Do we have In The Red's address?

00:38:25,111 --> 00:38:26,346
Last known

00:38:26,413 --> 00:38:28,381
was the U.S.
Federal Penitentiary

00:38:28,448 --> 00:38:29,516
in Marion, Illinois.

00:38:29,583 --> 00:38:30,884
When Nash gave him up,

00:38:30,951 --> 00:38:32,953
Cooper plead guilty.

00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:34,387
He served the full
seven years term.

00:38:34,454 --> 00:38:36,823
He got out, dropped off
the face of the earth.

00:38:54,641 --> 00:38:57,477

STOKES:
<i>The tire model</i>

00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,415
is a Dunlop KT-345.

00:39:02,482 --> 00:39:03,950
I checked with
the local dealers.

00:39:04,017 --> 00:39:07,420
The only ATV that uses
that particular type of tire

00:39:07,487 --> 00:39:08,522
has only been on the market
for about a year.

00:39:08,588 --> 00:39:10,390
It's called the Yamaha Raptor.

00:39:10,457 --> 00:39:11,791
So I got the list
of the names

00:39:11,858 --> 00:39:14,161
of everybody in Las Vegas
who's recently bought one.

00:39:14,227 --> 00:39:18,765
The only Cooper on the
list is female-- Janice.

00:39:18,832 --> 00:39:22,002
Well, Karl Cooper had
a girlfriend back in Ohio,

00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:23,603
a Janice Hanford.

00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:25,272
I mean, she
could be Cooper now.

00:39:25,338 --> 00:39:26,573
Do we have her address?

00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:32,145
Yeah. It's, uh,
second page.

00:39:32,212 --> 00:39:34,815
I think you
broke the case, Nick.

00:39:42,222 --> 00:39:43,824
( <i>tires squealing</i> )

Sweetie, come
with me, okay?

OFFICER:
Las Vegas police.
Open up!

00:40:00,741 --> 00:40:01,616
Janice Cooper?

00:40:01,616 --> 00:40:02,240
Yeah.

00:40:02,282 --> 00:40:03,216
We're looking for
your husband.

00:40:03,283 --> 00:40:04,317
He's not here.

00:40:04,384 --> 00:40:05,685
Don't take it personally,

00:40:05,752 --> 00:40:07,153
but I'm not going
to take your word for that.

00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,354
You guys never do.

00:40:08,421 --> 00:40:09,923
Look around all you like.

00:40:09,989 --> 00:40:11,457
Please step outside
with the child.

00:40:11,524 --> 00:40:12,659
It's for your own safety.

00:40:12,725 --> 00:40:14,928
Like I said, he's not here.

00:40:52,799 --> 00:40:54,834
Mommy doesn't like you.

00:40:54,901 --> 00:40:56,402
Really? Well, that's too bad.

00:40:56,469 --> 00:40:57,503
She hardly even knows me.

00:40:57,570 --> 00:41:00,440
Maddy, you
be nice, baby, okay?

00:41:00,506 --> 00:41:01,841
Definitely. Let's all be nice.

STOKES:
Jim...

00:41:03,142 --> 00:41:04,644
ATV has the
right tires

00:41:04,711 --> 00:41:06,412
and there are plenty
of machine tools

00:41:06,479 --> 00:41:08,681
and parts back there to build
a silencer.

00:41:08,748 --> 00:41:11,584
Where's Karl?
Go to hell.

00:41:11,651 --> 00:41:12,986
All right. Here's the way it is.

00:41:13,052 --> 00:41:14,687
You're going to jail,
she's going to Child Services.

00:41:14,754 --> 00:41:17,390
End of story.
I've had cops in my face
for half my life.

00:41:17,457 --> 00:41:19,259
You don't scare me.

( <i>phone rings</i> )

00:41:20,493 --> 00:41:22,929
Well, maybe that's
your lawyer now.

00:41:22,996 --> 00:41:24,764
Hello?

00:41:24,831 --> 00:41:28,835
Just answer yes or no--
are the cops there?

00:41:28,902 --> 00:41:30,870
Yes.

00:41:32,171 --> 00:41:34,674
Are they threatening
to take Maddy?

00:41:34,741 --> 00:41:38,177
Yes.

00:41:38,244 --> 00:41:43,216
That's what happens
when you marry a crook.

00:41:44,918 --> 00:41:47,287
I think they're
tracing this call.

00:41:47,353 --> 00:41:48,421
I'll take that phone.

00:42:14,013 --> 00:42:15,081
Hey, Officer.

00:42:15,148 --> 00:42:18,418
Yup?

00:42:18,484 --> 00:42:21,254
I'm going to make your day.

00:42:43,009 --> 00:42:46,012
Uncuff him,
will you, Mitch?

00:42:51,217 --> 00:42:53,987
Karl. Don't do
anything stupid.

00:42:56,122 --> 00:42:58,424
Palms out, please.

00:42:58,491 --> 00:43:01,594
I know the drill.

00:43:08,468 --> 00:43:09,769
So, tell me...

00:43:09,836 --> 00:43:12,105
Where'd I go wrong?

00:43:13,782 --> 00:43:15,324
You killed two people.
