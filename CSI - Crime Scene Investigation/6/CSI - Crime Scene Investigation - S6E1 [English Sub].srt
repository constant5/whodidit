00:00:11,375 --> 00:00:12,834
HELICOPTER PILOT ( <i>over radio):</i>
Control, this is Air One.

00:00:12,834 --> 00:00:14,636
I'm at the trailer park 402.

00:00:14,702 --> 00:00:17,250
There's a large gas main
construction fire.

00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:50,560
Warrick, why don't you and I
take the perimeter

00:00:50,626 --> 00:00:51,561
and work our way in.

00:00:51,627 --> 00:00:53,362
All right.
Greg, you're with us.

00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:54,564
I'll start the sketch.

00:00:59,202 --> 00:01:00,870
How you doing, Nick?

00:01:00,937 --> 00:01:02,105
Above ground, Wilcox.

00:01:04,273 --> 00:01:05,708
Would you like
inside or out?

00:01:05,775 --> 00:01:07,376
I'll take in.

00:01:07,443 --> 00:01:08,978
BRASS:
We got two vics.

00:01:10,913 --> 00:01:13,916
We think the girl
is Selena March.

00:01:13,983 --> 00:01:15,718
She owns the trailer.

00:01:15,785 --> 00:01:16,919
What about the male?

00:01:16,986 --> 00:01:18,554
BRASS:
Nothing yet.

00:01:18,621 --> 00:01:19,889
NICK:
This is a piece
of the roof

00:01:19,956 --> 00:01:21,257
right here--

00:01:21,324 --> 00:01:22,859
fiberglass
and particle board.

00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,796
These things weren't built
to last.

00:01:26,863 --> 00:01:28,264
They were built to burn.

00:01:28,331 --> 00:01:30,166
This place is totaled.

00:01:30,233 --> 00:01:31,467
The bed's collapsed.

00:01:31,534 --> 00:01:33,102
My money's on meth lab.

00:01:33,169 --> 00:01:35,505
SARA:
You know, Metcalf,

00:01:35,571 --> 00:01:37,140
just because somebody lives
in a trailer park,

00:01:37,206 --> 00:01:38,407
doesn't mean
they're a meth cook.

00:01:38,474 --> 00:01:40,917
You guys are a real pain
in the ass, you know that?

00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:42,779
Get used to it, pal.

I'm just having a little trouble
understanding this

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,695
because you all
live so close together.

00:02:20,762 --> 00:02:22,630
You mean none of you
saw the explosion?

00:02:22,697 --> 00:02:24,098
Uh, I heard it.

00:02:24,165 --> 00:02:25,400
Well, good.

00:02:25,466 --> 00:02:28,369
When I came out about
five minutes later,

00:02:28,436 --> 00:02:30,004
the whole place
was burnin' up.

00:02:30,071 --> 00:02:31,372
Where do you live?

00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:33,575
Right over there.

00:02:33,641 --> 00:02:34,642
Uh-huh.

00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:36,878
All right, let me get this
straight--

00:02:36,945 --> 00:02:39,147
you heard a blast like that
coming from your neighbor's

00:02:39,213 --> 00:02:40,848
and it took you five minutes
to poke your head out

00:02:40,915 --> 00:02:42,183
and see what was going on?

00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,018
I was watching TV.

00:02:44,085 --> 00:02:45,486
I'm sure he was drinking.

00:02:46,988 --> 00:02:47,956
No, hang around,
hang around.

00:02:48,022 --> 00:02:49,457
Hey, hang around.

00:02:49,524 --> 00:02:51,559
Did you find a man
in Selena's trailer?

00:02:51,626 --> 00:02:52,827
Now why would you
ask that?

00:02:52,894 --> 00:02:54,462
Was Selena a hooker?

00:02:54,529 --> 00:02:56,064
I'm sure I don't know.

00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,299
But one thing I do know,

00:02:58,366 --> 00:03:01,402
that's not Selena's car.

00:03:09,911 --> 00:03:11,079
( <i>cell phone rings</i> )

00:03:11,145 --> 00:03:13,081
Yeah?

00:03:13,147 --> 00:03:16,150
GRISSOM:
Catherine, we have
a 4-19 off Industrial.

00:03:16,217 --> 00:03:18,319
Do you mind handling it?

00:03:18,386 --> 00:03:20,154
So you get the team
back together

00:03:20,221 --> 00:03:22,357
only to break us
apart again.

00:03:22,423 --> 00:03:24,859
What kind of a perverse game
are you playing here, Gil?

00:03:24,926 --> 00:03:26,261
!
Same one as usual.

00:03:26,327 --> 00:03:27,629
Yeah, I'll cover it.

00:03:27,695 --> 00:03:29,464
I'm taking Warrick.

00:03:40,108 --> 00:03:42,043
Oh, hey, guys.
Good to see you.

00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:43,411
Hey, would you tell Nick

00:03:43,478 --> 00:03:45,079
I hope there's
no hard feelings

00:03:45,146 --> 00:03:47,949
about that whole,
you know, abduction thing.

00:03:48,016 --> 00:03:49,550
He hasn't returned
my calls.

00:03:49,617 --> 00:03:51,886
He's been busy.

00:03:53,955 --> 00:03:56,391
VARTANN:
Squad car found her about
a half hour ago-- no ID,

00:03:56,457 --> 00:03:58,493
but there's a lot
of homeless in this area.

00:04:01,029 --> 00:04:02,630
Looks like somebody took
something to her head.

00:04:02,697 --> 00:04:06,734
Didn't find a weapon, but
my guys are still looking.

00:04:06,801 --> 00:04:10,538
A shopping bag for a shirt,
rubber boots and a G-string.

00:04:10,605 --> 00:04:12,440
Homeless stripper?

00:04:12,507 --> 00:04:15,843
Well, this is
G-String Row, isn't it?

00:04:17,178 --> 00:04:19,314
Why is there a ring
on your ring finger?

00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,150
Because I'm married.

00:04:22,216 --> 00:04:24,719
What?

00:04:24,786 --> 00:04:26,654
VARTANN:
Congratulations.

00:04:26,721 --> 00:04:28,957
How much
did you pay her?

00:04:29,023 --> 00:04:31,926
No, seriously,
good luck with that, man.

00:04:31,993 --> 00:04:34,128
I didn't even know
you had a girlfriend.
Oh, yeah,

00:04:34,195 --> 00:04:36,464
it's a girl I've been dating
a couple months, Tina.

00:04:36,531 --> 00:04:37,732
How long have you been married?

00:04:37,799 --> 00:04:40,134
Since yesterday.

00:04:40,201 --> 00:04:42,403
Did this, uh,
drive-through wedding

00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:44,906
at Circus Circus Way,
you know.

00:04:44,973 --> 00:04:46,307
Fun, fun time.

00:04:46,374 --> 00:04:48,009
DAVID:
Hey.

00:04:48,076 --> 00:04:49,844
Sorry I'm late.
Busy night.

00:04:51,813 --> 00:04:53,448
We need a TOD, David.

00:04:55,049 --> 00:04:56,985
Rigor's barely set, so not long.

00:04:57,051 --> 00:04:58,853
Under four hours.

00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,822
About as long as
Warrick's been married.

00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:02,190
PHILLIPS:
You're married?

00:05:02,257 --> 00:05:03,825
Congratulations.

00:05:03,892 --> 00:05:05,760
Thanks.

00:05:05,827 --> 00:05:07,395
Do you think
she was dumped?

00:05:09,664 --> 00:05:11,499
Lividity is consistent
with the position

00:05:11,566 --> 00:05:12,567
of the body.

00:05:12,634 --> 00:05:13,768
So it's highly unlikely.

00:05:13,835 --> 00:05:15,603
All right.

00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:16,938
I'll check out
the strip clubs.

00:05:17,005 --> 00:05:18,306
I'll go with you.

00:05:22,944 --> 00:05:25,713
Well, there doesn't seem to be
any drug-manufacturing supplies,

00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,482
but plenty
of ignition sources:

00:05:27,548 --> 00:05:30,184
a hot plate, fondue pot,
gas stove, candles.

00:05:30,251 --> 00:05:32,954
One leaky pipe's all it takes.

00:05:35,223 --> 00:05:37,659
Which I haven't found yet.

00:05:37,725 --> 00:05:39,027
GRISSOM:
Yeah, but even if you had,

00:05:39,093 --> 00:05:40,962
that would only explain
the explosion in here,

00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:43,264
not the ruptured
gas main outside.

00:05:43,331 --> 00:05:44,999
Think I can help you with that.

00:05:45,066 --> 00:05:48,002
I found this gas meter
over by the main.

00:05:48,069 --> 00:05:49,003
Trailer blows,

00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,972
this thing
becomes a missile.

00:05:55,877 --> 00:05:57,946
One explosion leads to another.

00:05:58,012 --> 00:06:00,815
Yeah, but where
did it all start?

00:06:00,882 --> 00:06:03,318
Brass ran the plates on that
Acura near the trailer.

00:06:03,384 --> 00:06:05,720
It's registered
to a Robert Durgee.

00:06:05,787 --> 00:06:07,121
You get his photo
from the DMV?

00:06:07,188 --> 00:06:08,189
Confirmed as the vic--

00:06:08,256 --> 00:06:10,124
Henderson address,
mortgage broker.

00:06:10,191 --> 00:06:11,593
Wife's name was
on the insurance card.

00:06:11,659 --> 00:06:12,660
She coming in?

00:06:12,727 --> 00:06:13,661
She wasn't home.

00:06:13,728 --> 00:06:16,064
Brass is
tracking her down.

00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:17,198
Excuse me,
Mr. Grissom...

00:06:17,265 --> 00:06:20,034
An officer brought this in
off a call

00:06:20,101 --> 00:06:22,003
from Flora Nevada Nursery.

00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:24,005
They thought it might
have something to do

00:06:24,072 --> 00:06:25,440
with the Walter Gordon case.

00:06:36,417 --> 00:06:38,820
Female's lungs
were filled with soot.

00:06:38,886 --> 00:06:40,388
COD is smoke inhalation.

00:06:40,455 --> 00:06:43,791
Okay, that means the natural gas
didn't suffocate her.

00:06:43,858 --> 00:06:45,493
Explosion probably
knocked her out

00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,694
before the fire even started.

00:06:46,761 --> 00:06:49,697
Yeah, male didn't even
last that long.

00:06:49,764 --> 00:06:51,199
His lungs were clean,

00:06:51,266 --> 00:06:53,434
but he suffered fatal crushing
injuries to his abdomen.

00:06:53,501 --> 00:06:56,104
The pieces of debris
that were on this guy's body

00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:58,806
were not heavy.

00:06:58,873 --> 00:07:00,742
But the bed he was
lying in collapsed.

00:07:00,808 --> 00:07:02,477
Explosion could've done that.

00:07:08,283 --> 00:07:09,851
Let's photo-enhance
these bruises.

00:07:29,837 --> 00:07:31,339
( <i>clicks, beeps</i> )

00:07:38,613 --> 00:07:41,115
Yeah, yeah,
the UV light's definitely

00:07:41,182 --> 00:07:43,017
bringing out the bruises
underneath the skin.

00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,697
That looks like
a tire mark.

00:07:59,601 --> 00:08:02,503
Maybe our gas explosion
just turned into a hit-and-run.

00:08:24,225 --> 00:08:25,727
( <i>typing</i> )

00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:33,334
Well, Robert said that he was
going to be working late.

00:08:33,401 --> 00:08:37,672
So I went
to midnight bingo.

00:08:37,739 --> 00:08:39,140
Alone?

00:08:39,207 --> 00:08:41,542
Excuse me?

00:08:41,609 --> 00:08:44,145
Alone?

00:08:44,212 --> 00:08:47,615
I was...
with a friend.

00:08:47,682 --> 00:08:49,517
What was your friend's name?

00:08:49,584 --> 00:08:51,352
Why?

00:08:51,419 --> 00:08:53,821
Why not?

00:08:56,858 --> 00:08:58,826
He's married.

00:08:58,893 --> 00:09:02,363
Looks like the only person
in this thing who isn't married

00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:03,865
is the dead girl in the trailer
with your husband.

00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,069
You didn't know
he was having an affair?

00:09:08,136 --> 00:09:11,139
No, I had no idea.

00:09:11,205 --> 00:09:12,941
You have
a '96 blue Ford Ranger.

00:09:13,007 --> 00:09:14,809
We're going to need
to take a look at it.

00:09:14,876 --> 00:09:16,811
But my truck is in New Mexico.

00:09:16,878 --> 00:09:19,247
My brother borrowed it
this morning, he, uh...

00:09:19,314 --> 00:09:21,716
A wild guess: you have no idea
how to reach him.

00:09:21,783 --> 00:09:25,520
Not until he gets back.

00:09:25,587 --> 00:09:27,188
Why do you need to see my truck?

00:09:27,255 --> 00:09:29,023
Let me tell you a story.

00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:31,859
Once upon a time, you follow
your husband to a trailer park.

00:09:31,926 --> 00:09:33,995
You see him slumming
with his little trailer bunny.

00:09:34,062 --> 00:09:35,697
You waited for him
to come out...

00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,408
When she pulls
the body back in,

00:09:47,475 --> 00:09:49,644
before she can call for help,
you torch the place.

00:09:49,711 --> 00:09:50,745
Kaboom.

00:09:52,947 --> 00:09:54,282
The end.

00:09:54,349 --> 00:09:57,185
That is the craziest thing
I've ever heard.

00:09:57,252 --> 00:09:58,786
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:09:58,853 --> 00:10:01,656
Wouldn't even make my top ten.

00:10:03,834 --> 00:10:08,205
So that's when the bereaved
Mrs. Durgee lawyered up.

00:10:08,272 --> 00:10:09,740
Broadcast's out
on her truck,

00:10:09,807 --> 00:10:10,841
and the warrant's
ready to go.

00:10:10,908 --> 00:10:12,276
CURTIS:
I don't care
what he says.

00:10:12,343 --> 00:10:14,145
Put him in the tank
and see if he wises up.

00:10:14,211 --> 00:10:16,213
Sure as hell can't get
any dumber.

00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,115
Detective Curtis.

00:10:18,182 --> 00:10:20,451
Grissom.

00:10:20,518 --> 00:10:21,952
I thought you were supposed
to be arresting people

00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:23,187
in Boulder City.

00:10:23,254 --> 00:10:26,190
Well, a spot opened up here
and...

00:10:26,257 --> 00:10:27,992
I transferred in today.

00:10:28,059 --> 00:10:29,727
Surprise.

00:10:33,564 --> 00:10:37,368
Well, your mother
would be proud.

00:10:37,435 --> 00:10:38,636
My mother made Captain.

00:10:38,703 --> 00:10:42,273
You know, I'd just
qualified for my shield

00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,908
when the sheriff
pulled my papers

00:10:43,975 --> 00:10:46,544
and "volunteered" me to CSI.

00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:49,180
I think my mom hated that
more than I did.

00:10:49,246 --> 00:10:51,682
You won't miss the lab,
will you?

00:10:51,749 --> 00:10:55,052
There's some things I'll miss.

00:10:55,119 --> 00:10:57,321
I'll see you around.

00:11:50,007 --> 00:11:51,442
( <i>beeps</i> )

00:11:53,077 --> 00:11:55,212
So, Vartann and I struck out
on G-String Row.

00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,681
You poor guys.

00:11:56,747 --> 00:11:58,783
( <i>laughs</i> ):
Yeah, right.

00:11:58,849 --> 00:11:59,917
You know what I mean.

00:11:59,984 --> 00:12:02,019
No one recognized
the victim's picture.

00:12:03,454 --> 00:12:06,190
Listen, Cath,

00:12:06,257 --> 00:12:08,993
about this whole
marriage thing...

00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,561
Yeah, that.

00:12:10,628 --> 00:12:12,630
Yeah, that kind of threw me
for a loop.

00:12:14,298 --> 00:12:15,466
Tina, right?

00:12:15,533 --> 00:12:17,168
Yeah.

00:12:17,234 --> 00:12:18,569
She must be
a very special woman.

00:12:18,636 --> 00:12:20,571
I look forward to meeting her.

00:12:20,638 --> 00:12:21,739
Yes, she...

00:12:21,806 --> 00:12:23,074
The vic's blood-alcohol level

00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,343
was .16

00:12:25,409 --> 00:12:28,446
and COD was blunt-force trauma.

00:12:36,387 --> 00:12:38,322
Smashed and then

00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:40,558
smashed, huh?
Mm-hmm.

00:12:40,624 --> 00:12:43,127
Any luck on the, uh...

00:12:43,194 --> 00:12:44,829
victim's prints?

00:12:44,895 --> 00:12:46,631
No work card, no record.

00:12:46,697 --> 00:12:50,434
But the rubber boots
were standard-issue

00:12:50,501 --> 00:12:51,969
Streets and Sanitation.

00:12:54,672 --> 00:12:56,340
"E.V."?
Yeah, there's three

00:12:56,407 --> 00:12:58,509
S&amp;S workers with those initials.

00:12:58,576 --> 00:13:03,481
And it looks like an Eddie
Vonner was on duty last night.

00:13:03,547 --> 00:13:05,216
Why would you want
to see my boots?

00:13:05,282 --> 00:13:07,051
VARTANN:
You tell us.

00:13:07,118 --> 00:13:08,719
Look, I know
it's against the regs

00:13:08,786 --> 00:13:10,988
to pick up anything
other than trash,

00:13:11,055 --> 00:13:12,356
but, I mean, come on.

00:13:12,423 --> 00:13:15,626
<i>She was barefoot;</i>
<i>she was stepping on glass</i>

00:13:15,693 --> 00:13:18,362
<i>and crap,</i>
<i>so, yeah, I gave her my boots.</i>

00:13:18,429 --> 00:13:20,364
And she practically begged, so,

00:13:20,431 --> 00:13:22,066
I gave her a lift.

00:13:22,133 --> 00:13:23,834
So, you're just
a good Samaritan.

00:13:23,901 --> 00:13:26,003
Oh, come on, it was pretty
obvious she didn't belong there.

00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:27,738
Where?
Jefferson and K?
You ever see

00:13:27,805 --> 00:13:29,540
the citizens that hang out
in that neighborhood?

00:13:29,607 --> 00:13:31,642
When I see them,
they're usually dead.

00:13:31,709 --> 00:13:33,210
Well, there you go.

00:13:33,277 --> 00:13:34,712
I mean, come on, she...

00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:36,781
I could tell, despite the...

00:13:36,847 --> 00:13:38,382
well, the get-up, she was hot.

00:13:38,449 --> 00:13:40,184
And, I mean, I'm not talking
like garbage truck hot.

00:13:40,251 --> 00:13:42,320
I mean, she was like...

00:13:42,386 --> 00:13:43,821
like limo hot.

00:13:43,888 --> 00:13:45,723
VARTANN:
Listen, did she tell
you her name, or,

00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,825
uh, how she ended up there,
anything?

00:13:47,892 --> 00:13:50,261
She looked kind of embarrassed,
so I didn't push it.

00:13:50,328 --> 00:13:52,430
So, I just... I dropped her off
down at, uh,

00:13:52,496 --> 00:13:53,931
Western and Industrial.

00:13:53,998 --> 00:13:55,232
Never left my route.

00:13:55,299 --> 00:13:57,668
Why, did she, uh...?

00:13:57,735 --> 00:13:59,337
She say anything about me?

00:13:59,403 --> 00:14:02,940
She died a few blocks
from where you dropped her off.

00:14:07,144 --> 00:14:09,146
( <i>camera beeping</i> )

00:14:14,752 --> 00:14:17,621
If the wife torched the trailer
and caused the explosion,

00:14:17,688 --> 00:14:19,890
you would expect
to see small debris

00:14:19,957 --> 00:14:22,059
embedded all over
the inside of these walls.

00:14:22,126 --> 00:14:24,061
There's nothing here.

00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:28,232
( <i>camera beeping</i> )

00:14:31,902 --> 00:14:34,238
Hey, hey... Sara.

00:14:34,305 --> 00:14:36,407
Check this out.

00:14:36,474 --> 00:14:40,077
This is a piece
of the exterior wall

00:14:40,144 --> 00:14:42,380
facing the road.

00:14:42,446 --> 00:14:44,248
With a tire mark on it?

00:14:44,315 --> 00:14:45,316
Yeah.

00:14:45,383 --> 00:14:48,586
There is blue paint
on this gas main.

00:14:48,653 --> 00:14:51,989
Didn't mean anything
at the time.

00:14:53,391 --> 00:14:54,859
Amber has a blue Ford Ranger,
right?

00:14:54,925 --> 00:14:56,093
STOKES:
Uh-huh.

00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,131
What if Amber follows
her husband to trailer,

00:15:00,197 --> 00:15:02,133
sees him go inside,

00:15:02,199 --> 00:15:04,168
totally freaks out.

00:15:04,235 --> 00:15:05,836
Why wait for him to come out?

00:15:07,371 --> 00:15:09,273
( <i>engine revving</i> )

Yeah. Yeah, just come
straight through.

00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,581
Run him over in bed
with another chick.

00:15:17,648 --> 00:15:19,083
SIDLE:

00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,851
fire breaks out, sweeps through,

00:15:20,918 --> 00:15:22,987
and destroys practically
all evidence of a collision.

00:15:23,054 --> 00:15:25,790
It's too bad
we don't have her truck.

00:15:25,856 --> 00:15:27,625
We could match this
to her tires.

00:15:27,692 --> 00:15:30,461
Well, '96 Ford Ranger,
stock paint.

00:15:30,528 --> 00:15:35,099
Maybe I can match
the transfer to this.

00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:37,301

00:15:37,368 --> 00:15:38,502
I'm starving.

There's a uni going out
for sandwiches.

00:15:40,204 --> 00:15:41,706
Would you like me
to get you something?

No, no, you go ahead.

00:16:38,362 --> 00:16:40,564
According to the garbageman,
she ran up from this direction.

00:16:40,631 --> 00:16:41,732
Yeah?

00:16:41,799 --> 00:16:43,634
Must be
where she got the bag.

00:16:43,701 --> 00:16:44,902
Hmm.

00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:54,512
Victim wasn't carrying
a cell phone.

00:16:54,578 --> 00:16:57,048
She's in the wrong part of town
in her underwear,

00:16:57,114 --> 00:16:58,482
scared out of her head.

00:16:58,549 --> 00:17:01,719
She's gonna call her man,
her family, someone.

00:17:01,786 --> 00:17:03,788
And she didn't
have a quarter,

00:17:03,854 --> 00:17:06,223
so she called 911.

00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:07,725
I'll print the phones.

00:17:07,792 --> 00:17:09,794
I'll dump the call records.

00:17:15,266 --> 00:17:19,403
Let's get
the traffic cameras, too.

00:17:21,806 --> 00:17:23,274
The, uh, tread mark

00:17:23,341 --> 00:17:25,042
on your trailer wall
is consistent with

00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:27,979
Michelin 195/70/R14s.

00:17:28,045 --> 00:17:29,313
What about
the blue paint scrapings

00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,548
we found on the gas main?

00:17:30,614 --> 00:17:32,149
You got a real thing
for blue paint.

00:17:32,216 --> 00:17:33,317
You know that?

00:17:33,384 --> 00:17:34,652
But, uh, this
isn't from

00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,454
a Ford Ranger, or any Ford

00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,455
for that matter.

00:17:37,521 --> 00:17:38,656
It's a GMC paint.

00:17:38,723 --> 00:17:40,458
STOKES:
Amber Durgee was cheating
on her husband,

00:17:40,524 --> 00:17:41,892
maybe even wanted him dead,

00:17:41,959 --> 00:17:44,228
but her truck didn't have
anything to do with it.

00:17:44,295 --> 00:17:46,430
Right tires, wrong vehicle.

00:17:46,497 --> 00:17:47,965
Mm.

00:18:31,917 --> 00:18:33,218
Found something?

00:18:33,285 --> 00:18:34,519
Part of a headlamp, maybe.

00:18:34,586 --> 00:18:35,754
STOKES:
Well, I found

00:18:35,821 --> 00:18:38,924
some blue paint transfer
on that chain-link fence.

00:18:38,991 --> 00:18:41,159
As far as tracks go,

00:18:41,226 --> 00:18:42,594
this place is a parking lot,
man.

00:18:42,661 --> 00:18:43,795
They're everywhere.

00:18:43,862 --> 00:18:45,764
Except between the gas main
and the trailer.

00:18:45,831 --> 00:18:49,134
So, the trailer <i>wasn'trammed?</i>

00:18:50,969 --> 00:18:53,372
I think we're looking
at the, uh, vehicular equivalent

00:18:53,438 --> 00:18:55,374
of a through-and-through.

00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,310

That's what we're
gonna go with?

00:19:17,029 --> 00:19:19,031
Okay.

00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:23,452
The partial OEM number
on the headlamp piece

00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:26,208
belongs to a
'97 Pontiac Sunfire.

00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:27,142
Boy, that was quick.

00:19:27,209 --> 00:19:29,111
Well, GMC paint--
tire model wasn't that tough.

00:19:29,177 --> 00:19:31,113

another broadcast.
All right.

was worth a look.

No way this car was

00:19:48,697 --> 00:19:49,798
at the trailer park.

a new case.

at least six.

in there, there might be bullets
and casing.

00:21:23,492 --> 00:21:24,426
That's our girl.

00:21:24,493 --> 00:21:25,560
Will you tell me your location?

00:21:25,627 --> 00:21:26,795
No. I don't know
where I am, okay?!

00:21:26,862 --> 00:21:28,163
I don't know where I am.
I'm just...

00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:29,498
Yo, ho, get off my phone...

00:21:29,564 --> 00:21:30,899
BROWN:
Someone's getting territorial.

00:21:30,966 --> 00:21:32,367
I'll put Vartann on it.

00:21:35,971 --> 00:21:37,773
BROWN:
Vic loses her shoes.

00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:39,074
Explains the boots.

00:21:39,141 --> 00:21:40,742
Let see where she came from.

00:21:40,809 --> 00:21:42,110
Rewind it a little bit,
would you?

00:21:42,177 --> 00:21:43,779
Yeah.

00:21:43,845 --> 00:21:45,213
( <i>tape squealing</i> )

00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,448
BROWN:
Oh.

00:21:46,515 --> 00:21:47,983
Stop. Hold it.

00:21:50,285 --> 00:21:52,487
That looks like
an airport shuttle.

00:21:55,457 --> 00:21:57,059
There's a logo on this side.

00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:58,326
Yeah.

00:21:58,393 --> 00:21:59,828
I can enhance that.

00:21:59,895 --> 00:22:02,597
( <i>beeping</i> )

00:22:02,664 --> 00:22:03,899
ARCHIE:
That's a limo?

00:22:03,965 --> 00:22:05,600
This is Vegas.

00:22:05,667 --> 00:22:06,968
It's a strip bar on wheels.

00:22:13,608 --> 00:22:14,943
MAN:
I don't even pay attention
to the talent.

00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:16,578
I just drive down
Industrial Boulevard,

00:22:16,645 --> 00:22:18,914
from strip club
to strip club,
picking 'em up.

00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,048
It's like bus stops.

00:22:20,115 --> 00:22:21,083
Before you know it,
we're full,

00:22:21,149 --> 00:22:22,484
the bus is on fire...

00:22:22,551 --> 00:22:26,088
( <i>dance music playing</i> )

00:22:30,192 --> 00:22:32,828
We call it
the "Champagne Ride."

00:22:32,894 --> 00:22:33,829
It's nice.

00:22:33,895 --> 00:22:35,297
So what do the girls get paid
for this?

00:22:35,364 --> 00:22:37,699
The girls, they make
uh...

00:22:37,766 --> 00:22:40,268
at least twice as much
as they do in the clubs.

00:22:40,335 --> 00:22:42,637
Depending on what else
they ride.

00:22:42,704 --> 00:22:45,207
( <i>chuckling</i> ):
Oh...

00:23:00,155 --> 00:23:02,591
It's a pretty sweet deal
for the guys.

00:23:02,657 --> 00:23:04,860
Hot chicks getting trashed

00:23:04,926 --> 00:23:07,863
with no security
and nowhere to go.

00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:10,032
And what happens when
the girls want to get off?

00:23:10,098 --> 00:23:12,968
Usually, it's the guys
that are getting off.

00:23:14,102 --> 00:23:16,371
I found something in there
besides body fluids.

00:23:17,572 --> 00:23:19,508
Belongs to the victim,
Brooke Harris.

00:23:19,574 --> 00:23:22,044
You dropped that girl off
in a war zone, man.

00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:24,479
When the guy paying the tab says
he wants to stop, I just stop.

00:23:24,546 --> 00:23:28,850
( <i>music blaring, guys shouting)</i>

00:23:28,917 --> 00:23:29,685
Come on...

00:23:29,751 --> 00:23:30,686
Stop it!

00:23:30,752 --> 00:23:32,521
Back off, jerk!

00:23:32,587 --> 00:23:33,522
Stop the bus!

00:23:33,588 --> 00:23:34,389
Get her off the bus!

00:23:34,456 --> 00:23:36,391
No, I don't want...

00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:38,560
Look, strippers
are tough chicks, okay?

00:23:38,627 --> 00:23:41,229
I figured she'd find a way home,
one way or another.

00:23:47,736 --> 00:23:49,237
Brooke Harris was getting
calls from a gym?

00:23:49,304 --> 00:23:51,239
Well, the "Giselle" number
went straight to voice mail.

00:23:51,306 --> 00:23:53,508
The voice mail said
to contact her here.

00:23:53,575 --> 00:23:55,711
And what's the word
on the husband?

00:23:55,777 --> 00:23:56,678
Huh?

00:23:56,745 --> 00:23:57,713
The husband.

00:23:57,779 --> 00:23:59,181
Yeah... no,
according to his office,

00:23:59,247 --> 00:24:01,083
he's away in Laughlin
on business.

00:24:01,149 --> 00:24:03,452
We're still trying
to get in touch...

00:24:03,518 --> 00:24:07,356
Swing those legs
up and around.

00:24:07,422 --> 00:24:08,724
Yeah, like a waterfall...
you got it.

00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:11,593
That's it!

00:24:14,096 --> 00:24:16,064
So I called Brooke a few times.

00:24:16,131 --> 00:24:18,300
So what? She was
one of my students.

00:24:18,367 --> 00:24:20,068
You actually teach this?

00:24:20,135 --> 00:24:22,404
Strippers have
the best bodies in town.

00:24:22,471 --> 00:24:24,539
If you want the body,
this is how you get it.

00:24:24,606 --> 00:24:25,741
Trust me,
I've been doing this

00:24:25,807 --> 00:24:28,210
since before I had
my driver's license.

00:24:28,276 --> 00:24:29,878
Well, workout is one thing.

00:24:29,945 --> 00:24:32,814
What is a housewife
from Centennial Park

00:24:32,881 --> 00:24:34,082
doing on a stripper bus

00:24:34,149 --> 00:24:35,150
with pros?

00:24:35,217 --> 00:24:36,718
She wanted it.

00:24:36,785 --> 00:24:38,020
Come on...

00:24:38,086 --> 00:24:39,254
No, really.
She loved

00:24:39,321 --> 00:24:40,389
the attention.

00:24:40,455 --> 00:24:41,423
Loved the fantasy.

00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:42,958
She wanted to try it for real.

00:24:43,025 --> 00:24:45,861
See how she stacked up
against some real talent.

00:24:45,927 --> 00:24:47,529
And you let her.

00:24:47,596 --> 00:24:49,564
Do I look like her mother?

00:24:49,631 --> 00:24:51,967
You were teaching her a lesson.

00:24:52,034 --> 00:24:54,236
If I'd wanted to do that,

00:24:54,302 --> 00:24:56,071
I would've sent her
to Stripperama,

00:24:56,138 --> 00:24:57,472
fed her to the wolves.

00:24:57,539 --> 00:25:00,242
And drunk CEOs aren't wolves?

00:25:00,308 --> 00:25:01,877
They're worse.

00:25:01,943 --> 00:25:03,245
You know that.

00:25:03,311 --> 00:25:04,813
That's why you
kept calling her.

00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,015
So you could hear
all about it, right?

00:25:07,082 --> 00:25:09,217
I was just calling
to see how things went.

00:25:09,284 --> 00:25:10,419
CATHERINE:
Oh, really?

00:25:10,485 --> 00:25:12,921
It's starting to sound
like I need a lawyer.

00:25:16,792 --> 00:25:17,959
So I pulled all the ROs

00:25:18,026 --> 00:25:20,462

in Nevada,

00:25:20,529 --> 00:25:24,733

Right. The owners

Yeah?

00:30:03,412 --> 00:30:04,613
Yeah.

you're not so happy for me.

is the possibility
that it might come true.

that possibility...

Case is still open.

00:30:52,761 --> 00:30:53,929
That's roughly two days

00:30:53,995 --> 00:30:56,598
after the bodies ended up
in the trunk.

00:30:56,665 --> 00:30:59,267
Maybe our vics
were the beginning
of a little crime spree.

Thanks.

Last RO was a tow yard

Vehicle's most likely
an impound,

00:31:05,874 --> 00:31:09,344
sold under the table to some
scammer who faked his tags.

00:31:09,411 --> 00:31:10,746
You're not going to get
far in that direction.

00:31:10,812 --> 00:31:12,347
I know.
What about prints?

00:31:12,414 --> 00:31:13,548
13 different IDs.

00:31:13,615 --> 00:31:14,816
Some off work cards,
some off felonies

00:31:14,883 --> 00:31:18,120
ranging from assault,
B&amp;E, cocaine trafficking.

00:31:18,186 --> 00:31:20,889
Well, even if I do manage
to track them all down,

00:31:20,956 --> 00:31:24,259
there's no guarantee any
of these were involved
with the vics.

00:31:24,326 --> 00:31:26,028
Well, they didn't put
themselves in the trunk,

00:31:26,094 --> 00:31:28,330
and unless they were shot
right there at the curb,

00:31:28,397 --> 00:31:29,765
somebody drove
the car there.

00:31:29,831 --> 00:31:32,501
You're the detective.
Go detect.

00:31:32,567 --> 00:31:33,802
ROBBINS:
Fully developed
skeletal structure

00:31:33,869 --> 00:31:36,772
consistent with an adult male.

00:31:36,838 --> 00:31:40,008
The medial end of the clavicle's
almost fused.

00:31:40,075 --> 00:31:41,710
Suggests he's about
25 years old.

00:31:41,777 --> 00:31:43,979
Lack of prognathism

00:31:44,046 --> 00:31:45,814
indicates he's Caucasian.

00:31:45,881 --> 00:31:48,116
The female, however,

00:31:48,183 --> 00:31:50,385
is prognathic...

00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,655
and that suggests Negroid.

00:31:53,722 --> 00:31:55,857
Unfused epiphysial ends

00:31:55,924 --> 00:31:57,959
make her a teenager.

00:31:58,026 --> 00:32:00,996
White male,
younger black female...

00:32:01,063 --> 00:32:02,731
racially motivated?

00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:04,499
SANDERS:
Could be a Son of Sam thing.

00:32:04,566 --> 00:32:08,670
Summertime, couple on a date,
making out in the car.

00:32:08,737 --> 00:32:10,505
Berkowitz used a .44.

00:32:10,572 --> 00:32:12,240
ROBBINS:
Gunshot wounds

00:32:12,307 --> 00:32:13,942
are most likely COD for both.

00:32:14,009 --> 00:32:15,077
Female shows an entry wound

00:32:15,143 --> 00:32:17,212
at the rear
of the skull.

00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:18,980
Exit wound took off
most of her face.

00:32:19,047 --> 00:32:21,516
Male has no
exit wound,

00:32:21,583 --> 00:32:23,051
but the entry wound...

00:32:23,118 --> 00:32:24,920
is pretty obvious.

00:32:24,986 --> 00:32:26,221
( <i>gunshot</i> )

00:32:26,288 --> 00:32:28,090
Bullet never left the skull.

00:32:28,156 --> 00:32:30,092
That would explain
the bullet fragments.

00:32:30,158 --> 00:32:31,326
What we need

00:32:31,393 --> 00:32:32,761
are IDs.

00:32:32,828 --> 00:32:33,995
SANDERS:
No missing persons

00:32:34,062 --> 00:32:37,132
filed for Caucasian males
between 20 and 30

00:32:37,199 --> 00:32:38,266
in the last two weeks,

00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:40,669
but there are possibles
for the girl.

00:32:40,736 --> 00:32:42,003
Hm.

00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:45,507
Two cases still open.

00:32:45,574 --> 00:32:47,242
13 seems a little young.

00:32:47,309 --> 00:32:48,844
Could be a kidnapping.

00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:52,681
The other one's 16.

00:32:52,748 --> 00:32:55,951
This is one time it would
be better to stay missing.

00:33:02,375 --> 00:33:04,410
I also brought
her toothbrush

00:33:04,477 --> 00:33:06,946
and her hairbrush.

00:33:07,013 --> 00:33:09,115
This one's
from her doctor.

00:33:10,349 --> 00:33:11,517
Other's from
her dentist.

00:33:15,555 --> 00:33:18,124
How long is it
going to take you?

00:33:18,191 --> 00:33:20,259
That's hard to say.

00:33:20,326 --> 00:33:24,731
Mr. James, was Clara by any
chance seeing an older man?

00:33:24,797 --> 00:33:28,034
As far as I know,
she wasn't seeing anybody

00:33:28,101 --> 00:33:30,436
but it wouldn't surprise me
if she was.

00:33:30,503 --> 00:33:32,438
Clara wasn't smart
when it come to people,

00:33:32,505 --> 00:33:34,574
talking to any
lowlife chump

00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,209
who'd give her
the time of day.

00:33:36,275 --> 00:33:40,513
The girl never did listen
to a damn word I said.

00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,848
The older man...

00:33:41,914 --> 00:33:44,751
um... could've been someone
she met at school?

00:33:46,652 --> 00:33:48,855
Did she have a part-time job?

00:33:48,921 --> 00:33:51,958
Gooeybunz, over on El Dorado.

00:33:52,025 --> 00:33:56,329
We found a number of half-eaten
Gooeybunz in the car.

00:33:56,396 --> 00:33:59,065
You know, Clara wasn't
really that smart

00:33:59,132 --> 00:34:01,934
about her diet either,
but she hated those things.

00:34:02,001 --> 00:34:04,170
Smell'd get
into her clothes.

00:34:04,237 --> 00:34:07,507
By the time she got home, she
practically ready to throw up.

00:34:09,742 --> 00:34:12,678
You find out who did this...

00:34:12,745 --> 00:34:14,047
you let me know.

00:34:14,113 --> 00:34:15,915
Yeah.

00:34:18,384 --> 00:34:20,219
According
to Clara James' father,

00:34:20,286 --> 00:34:21,354
Clara didn't eat Gooeybunz.

00:34:21,421 --> 00:34:22,855
She didn't like them,
which means

00:34:22,922 --> 00:34:24,857
it was either
the killer

00:34:24,924 --> 00:34:27,026
or the male DB.

00:34:27,093 --> 00:34:29,162
So we're looking for...

00:34:29,228 --> 00:34:30,763
bite marks?

00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:31,898
If we find

00:34:31,964 --> 00:34:32,999
a good impression,

00:34:33,066 --> 00:34:34,634
maybe we'll get an ID
through dental records.

00:34:34,701 --> 00:34:36,469
You got it.

00:34:36,536 --> 00:34:38,705
And the student
becomes a master.

00:34:50,116 --> 00:34:52,618
I'm not seeing
any bite marks.

00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,188
Me either.

00:34:55,254 --> 00:34:57,557
It's not like they
were bitten at all.

00:34:57,623 --> 00:34:59,592
More like torn apart.

00:35:01,494 --> 00:35:03,262
Check it out.

00:35:03,329 --> 00:35:06,933
They might all be in pieces...

00:35:06,999 --> 00:35:08,668
but they're all still here.

00:35:08,735 --> 00:35:11,771
No one ever ate
any of them.

00:35:11,838 --> 00:35:12,772
Which is kinda weird.

00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:15,975
I mean, why buy all of 'em
and not eat 'em?

00:35:19,812 --> 00:35:23,116
I found this one
under a passenger seat--

00:35:23,182 --> 00:35:25,451
intact, on the floor.

00:35:25,518 --> 00:35:27,420
It escaped
the carnage.

00:35:48,441 --> 00:35:50,410
That's not frosting.

00:35:51,411 --> 00:35:54,313
I always liked the middle part
the best.

00:35:54,875 --> 00:35:57,778
BROWN:
<i>When she parks her car,</i>
<i>she's a hot housewife.</i>

00:35:57,845 --> 00:35:59,480
A few hours later,

00:35:59,547 --> 00:36:01,782
she's just another freak.

00:36:07,087 --> 00:36:08,422
It's my Mercedes, okay?

00:36:08,489 --> 00:36:10,357
I can prove it. Just
give me the keys.

00:36:10,424 --> 00:36:12,226
Show me ten bucks
or you ain't proving squat.

00:36:12,293 --> 00:36:13,761
I don't have anywhere to go!

00:36:13,827 --> 00:36:14,828
Brooke Harris
probably spent

00:36:14,895 --> 00:36:16,664
ten bucks a day
on nonfat lattes.

00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:19,400
Right.
She needed money
to get her car back.

00:36:19,466 --> 00:36:22,236
Well, I don't see
any ATMs around here.

00:36:22,303 --> 00:36:24,238
This is a bad place
to be broke.

00:36:24,305 --> 00:36:25,906
Hey, you miss me?

00:36:38,853 --> 00:36:40,855
Rusty flakes.

00:36:40,921 --> 00:36:43,824
Hey, Michaels, did you put
this crime tape up?

00:36:43,891 --> 00:36:45,893
Yes, sir.

00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:51,131
Yeah, well,
you missed something.

00:36:51,198 --> 00:36:53,167
There's blood on this rebar.

00:36:55,369 --> 00:36:56,770
Where'd you find that?

00:36:56,837 --> 00:37:00,074
I, uh... I just picked it up
over there...

00:37:17,558 --> 00:37:19,793
May I ask you a question?

00:37:21,161 --> 00:37:22,296
Do you recognize

00:37:22,363 --> 00:37:24,198
this woman?

00:37:24,265 --> 00:37:26,033
She's a thief.

00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,535
She took

00:37:27,601 --> 00:37:29,203
some money out of my hat.

00:37:35,643 --> 00:37:37,478
Hey! Hey!

00:37:45,052 --> 00:37:47,521
Stealing's a crime.

00:37:50,224 --> 00:37:52,059
Hey, Michaels.

00:37:52,126 --> 00:37:55,396
Think you might be able to
take this man into custody?

00:38:03,103 --> 00:38:04,104
<i>Tox confirmed that</i>

00:38:04,171 --> 00:38:05,773
the packet in the Gooeybun
contained cocaine,

00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:08,309
and one of the prints that
I lifted off the Grand Am

00:38:08,375 --> 00:38:10,844
was a felony conviction
for cocaine trafficking--

00:38:10,911 --> 00:38:14,048
Joey Zack, drug dealer.

00:38:14,114 --> 00:38:16,450
seems he liked to use Gooeybunz
to move his coke.

00:38:20,688 --> 00:38:23,858
He's a nice regular
customer at Gooeybunz.

00:38:23,924 --> 00:38:26,227
He used to chat up cute Clara
when he was there,

00:38:26,293 --> 00:38:27,761
sweet-talks her
into a date,

00:38:27,828 --> 00:38:29,797
and they both end up dead
in his bitchin' Grand Am.

00:38:29,864 --> 00:38:30,898
Well, whoever did it

00:38:30,965 --> 00:38:33,033
must've done it for the drugs.

00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,435
GCMS on the
melted gloves

00:38:34,501 --> 00:38:35,636
from your Grand Am.

00:38:35,703 --> 00:38:38,072
A delicious confection
of sugar, gelatin, starches,

00:38:38,138 --> 00:38:40,908
citric acid,
mineral oil,

00:38:40,975 --> 00:38:43,577
Red 40, Yellow 5, Blue 1
and carnauba wax,

00:38:43,644 --> 00:38:44,645
SIDLE:
Candy.

00:38:44,712 --> 00:38:46,981
Gummy candy.

00:38:47,047 --> 00:38:49,250
I'm partial to Jujubes myself.

00:38:49,316 --> 00:38:50,417
Is it something I said?

00:38:50,484 --> 00:38:52,052
Probably.

00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:55,122
Joey Zack's print
was found on the radio,

00:38:55,189 --> 00:38:57,625
which was tuned
to 107 FM.

00:38:57,691 --> 00:39:00,427
Now, as far as I know,
there is only one place in town

00:39:00,494 --> 00:39:04,398
where you can get gummies,
a generic cheeseburger,

00:39:04,465 --> 00:39:09,670
and 107.1 gets anything
other than static.

00:39:09,737 --> 00:39:11,105
( <i>static</i> )

00:39:11,171 --> 00:39:13,741
Sorry, I don't recognize him.

00:39:13,807 --> 00:39:15,843
Most of the time when people
come here, it's dark.

00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:17,878
How about this?
You ever seen this car before?

00:39:17,945 --> 00:39:20,481
No, all I remember
from the last two weeks

00:39:20,548 --> 00:39:23,684
is what's playing 'cause
I've seen it 8,000 times.

00:39:23,751 --> 00:39:26,921
<i>Killer Punch.</i> A big
draw for crap cars.

00:39:26,987 --> 00:39:28,689
We're gonna need
to talk to your employees.

00:39:28,756 --> 00:39:29,924
Oh, come on, please.

00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:31,325
Is that really
necessary?

00:39:31,392 --> 00:39:33,327
It's a homicide
investigation.

00:39:33,394 --> 00:39:36,363
We could just call the
health inspector and...

00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:38,465
see how many code violations
he has festering

00:39:38,532 --> 00:39:39,600
in that concession stand.

00:39:39,667 --> 00:39:41,802
Geez, fine,
knock yourselves out.

00:39:41,869 --> 00:39:43,804
Jerry's on tickets...

00:39:43,871 --> 00:39:46,140
Maddox runs the projector,
and Darryl's in concessions.

00:39:46,207 --> 00:39:48,275
No. No, he quit last week.

00:39:48,342 --> 00:39:49,777
Why?

00:39:49,843 --> 00:39:52,546
He said he was gonna go live
with his parents up in Mesquite.

00:39:54,048 --> 00:39:56,183
CURTIS:
Guy's name is Darryl Blakeny.

00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:59,687
Small-time hood with priors
for B&amp;E and possession.

00:39:59,753 --> 00:40:02,056
His prints were on the
steering wheel of the Grand Am.

00:40:02,122 --> 00:40:03,891
SANDERS:
When he quit his job
at the drive-in,

00:40:03,958 --> 00:40:06,227
he was in court-ordered rehab.

00:40:06,293 --> 00:40:09,230
We figured Blakeny was one
of Joey Zack's customers.

00:40:09,296 --> 00:40:11,065
One night, Blakeny

00:40:11,131 --> 00:40:13,534
sees his coke dealer's Grand Am
at the drive-in,

00:40:13,601 --> 00:40:15,769
and the fiend snaps.

00:40:17,037 --> 00:40:18,873
( <i>cocks gun</i> )

00:40:19,907 --> 00:40:21,208
Move, and you're dead!

00:40:21,275 --> 00:40:22,443
Shut up!
All right, all right,
all right!

00:40:22,509 --> 00:40:23,978
Give me the coke, Joey!

00:40:24,044 --> 00:40:25,279
Give me the coke!

00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,049
Do we know where he killed them?

00:40:29,116 --> 00:40:30,885
We don't know where yet.

00:40:30,951 --> 00:40:31,952
CURTIS:
Or why.

00:40:32,019 --> 00:40:33,254
SIDLE:
Maybe the girl

00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,689
started freaking out;
maybe Blakeny's just a psycho.

00:40:35,756 --> 00:40:38,158
Anyway, uh, Blakeny

00:40:38,225 --> 00:40:39,260
tossed the bodies,

00:40:39,326 --> 00:40:41,862
and throws them in the trunk
and drives home.

00:40:41,929 --> 00:40:44,131
The street where the Grand Am
was found

00:40:44,198 --> 00:40:46,400
is a block away
from his last known residence.

00:40:46,467 --> 00:40:48,202
SANDERS:
He leaves it there
collecting parking tickets,

00:40:48,269 --> 00:40:50,604
skips town,
and uses the same gun

00:40:50,671 --> 00:40:53,607
two days later in another
drug-related crime in Mesquite.

00:40:53,674 --> 00:40:56,210
The scumbag's still in the wind.

00:40:56,277 --> 00:40:59,113
At least he's in the system
with a double homicide.

00:40:59,179 --> 00:41:02,750
That's not going to satisfy
Clara James' father.

00:41:05,352 --> 00:41:07,655
Can she cook?
Is she a good cook?

00:41:07,721 --> 00:41:08,856
Come on, Warrick.

00:41:08,923 --> 00:41:09,890
Hey, Grissom.

00:41:09,957 --> 00:41:11,192
We're taking Warrick

00:41:11,258 --> 00:41:12,893
to the Pepper Mill
to celebrate his marriage

00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,961
and to condemn

00:41:14,028 --> 00:41:15,296
his elopement.

00:41:15,362 --> 00:41:16,363
You in?

00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:18,299
Did you invite
your wife?

00:41:18,365 --> 00:41:19,466
I don't think I'm ready

00:41:19,533 --> 00:41:21,235
to subject her to the crew
just yet.

00:41:21,302 --> 00:41:23,037
WILLOWS:
I got to beg off, you guys.

00:41:23,103 --> 00:41:24,271
Got to take
Lindsay to school.

00:41:24,338 --> 00:41:26,106
All right.
Bye.

00:41:26,173 --> 00:41:27,741
STOKES:
Bye.

00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:28,943
So?

00:41:29,009 --> 00:41:31,111
I got one more thing to do.
All right.

00:41:32,146 --> 00:41:35,316
Don't.

00:41:35,382 --> 00:41:37,251
WALTER GORDON ( <i>over computer):</i>
So, breathe quick.

00:41:37,318 --> 00:41:39,119
Breathe slow.

00:41:39,186 --> 00:41:43,090
Put your gun in your mouth
and pull the trigger.

00:41:43,157 --> 00:41:48,128
Any way you like,
you're going to die here.

00:41:48,195 --> 00:41:49,597
Okay?

00:41:49,663 --> 00:41:51,265
OTHER VOICE:
Perfect.

00:41:51,332 --> 00:41:53,767
( <i>recording winding</i>
<i>at high speed</i> )

00:41:53,834 --> 00:41:54,969
GORDON:
Okay?

00:41:55,035 --> 00:41:56,370
OTHER VOICE:
Perfect.

00:41:57,671 --> 00:41:59,673
How'd you know it
was going to be there?

00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:01,141
If that "okay" had been meant
for Nick,

00:42:01,208 --> 00:42:03,010
it wouldn't have been
in the form of a question.

00:42:03,077 --> 00:42:04,912
I think maybe Walter Gordon

00:42:04,979 --> 00:42:08,115
had an accomplice.

00:42:08,182 --> 00:42:09,783
( <i>typing</i> )

00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:12,086
Perfect.

00:42:12,152 --> 00:42:13,153
Male or female?

00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:15,689
It's, um...

00:42:15,756 --> 00:42:17,825
hard to say.

00:42:17,892 --> 00:42:19,293
The tape was pretty mangled.

00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,262
Enhancement
and noise cancellation

00:42:21,328 --> 00:42:22,530
increase intelligibility,

00:42:22,596 --> 00:42:24,431
but it alters
timber and tone.

00:42:24,498 --> 00:42:26,500
I don't know

00:42:26,567 --> 00:42:28,369
there's any more I can do here.

00:42:28,435 --> 00:42:30,204
You know,
Nick recorded a message

00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:31,739
on the flip side of the tape.

00:42:31,805 --> 00:42:32,806
You think maybe we should...

00:42:32,873 --> 00:42:34,241
No.

00:42:35,609 --> 00:42:37,611
This is between you and me.
