( <i>children laughing, shouting)</i>

00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,872
Jesse?

00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:43,209
Jesse?

00:00:44,277 --> 00:00:46,412
Jesse... Jesse,
can you hear me?

00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:51,050
Jesse, please!

00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:53,186
Jesse!!

00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:56,166
Jesse Matthews,
six years old.

00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:57,500
GRISSOM:
Is this an old photo?

00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,868
Yeah, it's the only one
the mom had.

00:00:59,583 --> 00:01:01,752
She said one minute, he's
on the swing, the next minute

00:01:01,818 --> 00:01:02,953
he's gone.
Abduction.

00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,187
The search radius
is over a mile--

00:01:04,254 --> 00:01:05,622
no sign of the boy.

00:01:05,689 --> 00:01:06,990
What about the father?

00:01:07,057 --> 00:01:08,325
The father is, um...

00:01:08,392 --> 00:01:11,928
Army sergeant, uh...
Dwight Matthews.

00:01:11,995 --> 00:01:13,830
Killed in Afghanistan
four years ago.

00:01:13,897 --> 00:01:16,166
Any other family members?
Grandparents? Boyfriends?

00:01:16,233 --> 00:01:17,768
BRASS:
No, her parents are dead

00:01:17,834 --> 00:01:19,102
and her husband's parents--

00:01:19,169 --> 00:01:21,505
she lost communication
with them since he died.

00:01:23,407 --> 00:01:25,609
Mrs. Matthews...
this is Gil Grissom

00:01:25,676 --> 00:01:27,944
and Warrick Brown
from the Crime Lab.

00:01:28,011 --> 00:01:31,682
I, uh... I never bring
Jesse to the park.

00:01:31,748 --> 00:01:34,317
But this afternoon,
the backyard just
couldn't hold him,

00:01:34,384 --> 00:01:38,989
so we came here and... uh...
he was on the swings;

00:01:39,056 --> 00:01:40,924
I couldn't even
get him off,

00:01:40,991 --> 00:01:43,226
and then I look around
and he's gone; he's just...

00:01:43,293 --> 00:01:47,798
Mrs. Matthews, there's really
nothing more you can do here.

00:01:47,864 --> 00:01:50,167
Why don't you let us
give you a ride home?

00:01:50,233 --> 00:01:53,303
I'm not leaving.

00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:55,505
Not without Jesse.

00:02:01,945 --> 00:02:03,547
I called the team.

00:02:05,082 --> 00:02:06,817
They always look so vulnerable.

00:02:06,883 --> 00:02:08,852
They are.

It's like trying to get
an i.d. on swimmers

00:02:45,937 --> 00:02:47,838
from ripples in the pool.
How about you?

00:02:47,905 --> 00:02:52,777
Lots of little fingers...
and some big ones.

00:02:52,843 --> 00:02:54,178
Helping hands?

00:02:59,417 --> 00:03:00,351

( <i>sets case down</i> )

00:03:21,706 --> 00:03:24,442
So, ma'am, do you
remember this boy?

00:03:24,508 --> 00:03:26,911
It's not a recent photo.

00:03:26,978 --> 00:03:27,912
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:03:27,979 --> 00:03:29,981
I had my hands full.

00:03:30,047 --> 00:03:31,749
I don't take my eyes
off him ever.

00:03:31,816 --> 00:03:33,017
Sure. I understand.

00:03:33,084 --> 00:03:35,086
But there was this
man near the swings--

00:03:35,152 --> 00:03:38,723
he kept looking around like
he was waiting for something.

00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:40,224
What'd he look like?

00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:42,460
He was a white guy,
blue baseball cap...

00:03:42,526 --> 00:03:43,527
That's all
I remember.

00:03:43,594 --> 00:03:45,596
Did he seem interested
in one of the kids?

00:03:45,663 --> 00:03:47,732
Yeah. A boy.

00:03:47,798 --> 00:03:49,967
Could be that boy.

00:03:51,335 --> 00:03:52,837
Mm... it's hard to tell.
Okay...

00:03:52,904 --> 00:03:55,306
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

00:03:58,843 --> 00:04:00,344
Mrs. Matthews...

00:04:00,411 --> 00:04:01,846
I know this is difficult
for you,

00:04:01,913 --> 00:04:03,180
but I have to ask you
again--

00:04:03,247 --> 00:04:04,515
do you remember seeing anyone

00:04:04,582 --> 00:04:05,950
hanging around near the swings?

00:04:06,017 --> 00:04:10,521
Anyone. Maybe, maybe a man
in a blue baseball cap?

00:04:16,394 --> 00:04:17,862
Yes.

00:04:17,929 --> 00:04:19,130
Can you describe him?

00:04:19,196 --> 00:04:20,131
He was white...

00:04:20,197 --> 00:04:21,566
White...

00:04:21,632 --> 00:04:24,001
Uh... just under six feet,
I think.

00:04:24,068 --> 00:04:25,703
Six feet. Great.

00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:26,771
Jeans.

00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:32,577
Did he take Jesse?

00:04:32,643 --> 00:04:34,478
We don't know.

00:04:59,937 --> 00:05:01,572
Our K-9 officers
are going to need

00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:04,175
something that
Jesse's worn recently.

00:05:04,242 --> 00:05:06,177
Uh... his jacket.

00:05:06,244 --> 00:05:08,246
It's in the car.
I'll get it for you.

00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:14,418

Whoa! Whoa!
What are they doing?

00:05:44,515 --> 00:05:45,583
Pull the dogs
back, please.

00:05:48,853 --> 00:05:49,921
Can I see this jacket?

00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:57,295
Has Jesse ever worn this?

00:05:57,361 --> 00:05:58,362
I just bought it for him.

00:05:58,429 --> 00:06:00,131
He's been growing so fast.
I'm sorry, I...

00:06:00,197 --> 00:06:02,767
That's okay; we'll get
something from your house.

00:06:32,496 --> 00:06:34,498
What do you make of this?

00:06:36,467 --> 00:06:38,302
Possible struggle...

00:06:38,369 --> 00:06:40,905
That could've been used
as a weapon.

00:06:40,972 --> 00:06:42,340
The blood drops could be

00:06:42,406 --> 00:06:44,408
castoff.

00:06:59,156 --> 00:07:01,325
Maybe the poor kid had to pee
while his mom was in the car.

00:07:11,269 --> 00:07:14,005
Mrs. Matthews, I need you
to take a look at something.

00:07:14,071 --> 00:07:15,573
Do you recognize these?

00:07:21,112 --> 00:07:22,213
They're...

Every mother's
worst nightmare.

00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:47,738
I checked her answering
machine: no calls.

00:07:47,805 --> 00:07:49,607
Well, I'll get a DNA exemplar
for Jesse

00:07:49,674 --> 00:07:51,542
and let her get some sleep.

00:07:51,609 --> 00:07:52,843
She won't sleep.

00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:54,845
Okay, Greg, let's do a little
legwork, what do you say?

00:07:54,912 --> 00:07:56,147
You take this side
of the street,

00:07:56,214 --> 00:07:57,815
I'll take the other--
find out if anybody's

00:07:57,882 --> 00:07:59,183
seen anything suspicious.

00:08:26,577 --> 00:08:28,579
Mrs. Matthews?

00:08:35,353 --> 00:08:36,754
Mrs. Matthews?

00:08:38,456 --> 00:08:41,058
I'm Catherine Willows
from the Crime Lab.

00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:43,461
Sorry about the mess.

00:08:43,527 --> 00:08:44,462
It's okay.

00:08:44,528 --> 00:08:47,698
Jesse was so full of energy
this morning.

00:08:47,765 --> 00:08:50,101
He didn't give me time
to clean up.

00:08:50,167 --> 00:08:52,270
I understand.

00:08:52,336 --> 00:08:54,505
This photo...

00:08:54,572 --> 00:08:57,174
Is it recent?

00:08:57,241 --> 00:09:00,211
Uh, yeah, that's, uh,
that's from last month.

00:09:00,278 --> 00:09:03,047
If it's all right with you,
I'd like to borrow it.

00:09:03,114 --> 00:09:04,682
I'll get it
to Nevada Child Search,

00:09:04,749 --> 00:09:06,584
and they can get it out
to the media.

00:09:06,651 --> 00:09:07,718
Sure.

00:09:07,785 --> 00:09:08,920
Thank you.

00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:14,659
Jesse's home-schooled.

00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,796
We do art together...
music...

00:09:18,863 --> 00:09:21,232
Everything.

00:09:24,535 --> 00:09:26,204
Do you have children?

00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:30,074
I have a daughter.
Thirteen.

00:09:30,141 --> 00:09:32,476
WILLOWS:
"Thirty-six and a half inches."

00:09:32,543 --> 00:09:36,013
We'll add it to
the physical description.

00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,248
And, Mrs. Matthews,

00:09:37,315 --> 00:09:39,283
our K-9 Unit
will need something

00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,985
with Jesse's scent.

00:09:41,052 --> 00:09:41,986
Oh, right, right.

00:09:42,053 --> 00:09:44,755
Um... maybe... maybe
his stuffed dinosaur?

00:09:44,822 --> 00:09:46,757
He holds it while
he's sleeping.

00:09:46,824 --> 00:09:48,659
That'll work.

00:09:48,726 --> 00:09:51,195
And I will need something
with his DNA:

00:09:51,262 --> 00:09:52,863
a toothbrush, hairbrush,

00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:54,332
pillowcase...

00:09:54,398 --> 00:09:55,900
Why do you need that?

00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,469
Well, if we locate anything
that could lead us to him,

00:09:58,536 --> 00:10:00,605
we want to make sure
we've got the right boy.

00:10:00,671 --> 00:10:03,875
Well, I'll get those things
for you.

00:10:16,921 --> 00:10:18,222
Hi.

00:10:18,289 --> 00:10:20,224
Captain Brass asked me
to drive the lady's car home.

00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:21,592
Oh... okay.

00:10:21,659 --> 00:10:22,760
Yeah, I'll let her know.

00:10:22,827 --> 00:10:24,328
Thanks.
Mm-hmm.

00:10:48,419 --> 00:10:49,587
Since her husband died,

00:10:49,654 --> 00:10:51,923
Kids' toys always
laying around.

00:10:51,989 --> 00:10:53,724
I'm always
tossing balls

00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:55,927
over my fence back
into her yard

00:10:55,993 --> 00:10:58,829
They keep to themselves,
which is fine by me.

00:10:58,896 --> 00:11:00,831
Sir, have you seen
any suspicious cars

00:11:00,898 --> 00:11:02,633
in the neighborhood,
or strangers?

00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,303
I work all day
and I don't spend my nights

00:11:05,369 --> 00:11:06,871
looking at the neighbors, okay?

00:11:06,938 --> 00:11:08,439
Well, what about the weekends?

00:11:08,506 --> 00:11:10,141

Oh, she's my sweetie.

00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:15,980
Who's my good girl?

00:11:16,047 --> 00:11:17,515
Queenie's my
good girl.

00:11:17,582 --> 00:11:20,985
Yes, you are. Yes, you are.

00:11:21,052 --> 00:11:22,853
Interesting how things work out.

00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,188
What do you mean?

00:11:24,255 --> 00:11:26,123
Her kid getting killed.

00:11:26,857 --> 00:11:27,725
This is Queenie.

00:11:27,792 --> 00:11:31,629
My last dog, Princess...

00:11:31,696 --> 00:11:33,331
Princess died,

00:11:33,397 --> 00:11:34,699
and she did it.

00:11:34,765 --> 00:11:36,534
Karen Matthews?

00:11:36,601 --> 00:11:38,369
Four years ago.

00:11:38,436 --> 00:11:41,072
I found Princess
hanging off the back fence.

00:11:41,138 --> 00:11:43,674
Supposed to look
like it was an accident,

00:11:43,741 --> 00:11:45,877
like she got caught
on collar and choked.

00:11:45,943 --> 00:11:47,311
Did you see her do that?

00:11:47,378 --> 00:11:48,312
No,

00:11:48,379 --> 00:11:51,148
but I knew.

00:11:51,215 --> 00:11:54,085
See, Princess used to bark
through the fence at her kid.

00:11:54,151 --> 00:11:56,654
She just
wanted to play.

00:11:56,721 --> 00:11:59,690
If you ask me,
you know what?

00:11:59,757 --> 00:12:00,825
the kid liked it,

00:12:00,892 --> 00:12:03,394
but Karen she just went
off the deep end.

00:12:03,461 --> 00:12:05,229
Mr. McCracken,

00:12:05,296 --> 00:12:07,164
who told you her son was killed?

00:12:33,257 --> 00:12:34,859
Who takes care of the hamsters?

00:12:34,926 --> 00:12:37,194
Jesse. When he remembers.

00:12:37,261 --> 00:12:39,363
which is about
as often

00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:41,966
as he remembers
to brush his teeth.

00:12:44,435 --> 00:12:46,404
Mrs. Matthews,

00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:47,638
has Jesse ever
run away from home?

00:12:47,705 --> 00:12:49,974
He'd never do that.

00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:53,344
Was he upset about anything?

00:12:53,411 --> 00:12:56,080
No. No. No.

00:12:56,147 --> 00:12:57,949
You're going to find him.

00:12:58,015 --> 00:12:59,584
If something
happened,

00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:01,652
I'd know.

00:13:04,488 --> 00:13:06,224
I'd know here.

00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:08,226
Of course. I'd feel the same.

00:13:10,027 --> 00:13:11,829
Mrs. Matthews,
when the officer

00:13:11,896 --> 00:13:12,964
brought your car back,

00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,298
I noticed that there were gifts

00:13:14,365 --> 00:13:16,067
in the garage that were

00:13:16,133 --> 00:13:19,904
from your
husband's parents.

00:13:19,971 --> 00:13:22,773
The, um...
the colonel

00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,642
and his wife.

00:13:24,709 --> 00:13:26,410
We're, uh, we're
not in touch anymore.

00:13:26,477 --> 00:13:28,446
Ever since

00:13:28,512 --> 00:13:31,249
Dwight was...

00:13:31,315 --> 00:13:32,350
Ever since Dwight died,

00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:35,920
my father-in-law thinks he
should be raising Jesse, not me.

00:13:35,987 --> 00:13:38,689
He runs that house
like an Army barracks.

00:13:38,756 --> 00:13:41,425
Do you know what
that does to a boy?

00:13:41,492 --> 00:13:43,261
Well, I saw what

00:13:43,327 --> 00:13:46,497
it did to Dwight, and I will
<i>not</i> let him do that to Jesse.

00:13:46,564 --> 00:13:49,333
I'm still going to need
some contact information.

00:13:52,737 --> 00:13:53,871
They took him.

00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:50,709
We haven't seen Karen
or Jesse since, um... uh...

00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,018
since...

00:14:53,085 --> 00:14:54,920
We haven't seen
them in four years,

00:14:54,987 --> 00:14:57,222
since the day we buried our son.

00:15:01,694 --> 00:15:04,496
Here. Here's
your toy soldier.

00:15:10,269 --> 00:15:11,570
Warren, not today.

00:15:11,637 --> 00:15:12,671
He's my grandson.

00:15:12,738 --> 00:15:14,573
It-it's, it's a toy.

00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,576
I will raise
my own son-- not you.

00:15:21,013 --> 00:15:25,451
Jesse comes from a, from a
long line of military men

00:15:25,517 --> 00:15:27,386
going all the
way back to

00:15:27,453 --> 00:15:29,655
Bull Run.

00:15:29,722 --> 00:15:30,823
Were you in the service?

00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:33,092
Yes, sir. Marine Corps.

00:15:33,158 --> 00:15:34,827
I bet your dad was, too, right?

00:15:34,894 --> 00:15:36,996
You know, we're here to talk
about your family, not mine.

00:15:37,062 --> 00:15:38,998
If we hadn't seen

00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:41,634
Jesse's picture
last night on TV,

00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,969
we wouldn't know what
he looked like now.

00:15:44,036 --> 00:15:45,137
She blames me.

00:15:45,204 --> 00:15:46,639
I do not.
Don't tell me

00:15:46,705 --> 00:15:47,907
what I know and don't know,

00:15:47,973 --> 00:15:49,241
all right?

00:15:49,308 --> 00:15:50,776
Can I please just go
to the bathroom?

00:15:50,843 --> 00:15:52,278
Oh, absolutely. Absolutely.

00:15:52,344 --> 00:15:53,445
Where is it?

00:15:53,512 --> 00:15:56,982
It's. uh... down the hall

00:15:57,049 --> 00:15:58,317
to the right,
through the door.

00:15:58,384 --> 00:15:59,685
Excuse me.

00:16:03,689 --> 00:16:05,491
This is just between

00:16:05,558 --> 00:16:08,294
you and me.

00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,828
I saw Karen last week.

00:16:13,365 --> 00:16:15,968
Oh, hi, Karen, uh,
could I see Jesse

00:16:16,035 --> 00:16:16,969
please?
No.

00:16:17,036 --> 00:16:19,204
Karen, he's my only grandson.

00:16:19,271 --> 00:16:21,006
You can't have him, okay?

00:16:21,073 --> 00:16:22,274
I don't want to
keep him, Karen.

00:16:22,341 --> 00:16:23,709
I just want to give
him these. Please.

00:16:23,776 --> 00:16:24,977
Just leave us alone.

00:16:25,044 --> 00:16:26,312
Jesse! It's
Grandpa. Jesse!
No, please.

00:16:28,781 --> 00:16:30,716
Colonel?

00:16:34,987 --> 00:16:36,555
Where's my wife?

00:16:36,622 --> 00:16:39,525
She's in the ladies' room.
It's okay.

00:16:39,592 --> 00:16:41,794
Do you get these

00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:44,830
uh... these spells often?

00:16:44,897 --> 00:16:46,232
There's some
memory loss?

00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:51,870
It's early Alzheimer's.

00:16:51,937 --> 00:16:54,240
That's a tough one.

00:16:54,306 --> 00:16:58,210
All I wanted was
to see my grandson.

00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,482
Find him for me.

00:17:03,549 --> 00:17:05,551
We'll do our best, sir.

00:17:05,618 --> 00:17:07,519
We'll do our very best.

00:17:09,021 --> 00:17:10,856
BROWN:
<i>Any luck with those prints</i>

00:17:10,923 --> 00:17:11,857
from the swing?

00:17:11,924 --> 00:17:14,226
Nothing on AFIS, but Brass
did put out a bulletin

00:17:14,293 --> 00:17:15,861
for the guy in the
blue baseball cap.

00:17:15,928 --> 00:17:17,162
I wouldn't get
our hopes up--

00:17:17,229 --> 00:17:18,464
it's a vague
description.

00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:19,632
What about the K-9 search?

00:17:19,698 --> 00:17:20,699
Nothing.

00:17:22,034 --> 00:17:23,636
What do you got for me?

00:17:23,702 --> 00:17:25,537
Well, I ran
the exemplar toothbrush

00:17:25,604 --> 00:17:26,839
against a blood sample

00:17:26,906 --> 00:17:27,973
from the men's room.

00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,275
It's not a match.

00:17:29,341 --> 00:17:30,342
What about the underpants?

00:17:30,409 --> 00:17:32,511
Couldn't get enough
epithelials for DNA

00:17:32,578 --> 00:17:33,612
'cause the kid probably hadn't

00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:34,880
been wearing them for very long.

00:17:34,947 --> 00:17:36,015
I wonder why.

00:17:36,081 --> 00:17:37,249
Well, I did confirm

00:17:37,316 --> 00:17:39,985
a positive result for
urea in the underpants.

00:17:40,052 --> 00:17:42,922
and the quantity and
distribution suggests that

00:17:42,988 --> 00:17:44,790
the kid wet himself.

00:17:44,857 --> 00:17:47,993
Ditched his wet tighty-whiteys
and went back out to play.

00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:50,296
( <i>beeping</i> )

00:17:50,362 --> 00:17:52,264
I got a hit on your blood.
Conner Daly.

00:17:52,331 --> 00:17:54,466
Convicted of NRS 201.450.

00:17:54,533 --> 00:17:55,634
Out on parole.

00:17:55,701 --> 00:17:57,436
What's a 450?

00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:59,438
That'd be "Sex With Dead Body."

00:18:04,009 --> 00:18:08,814
Mr. Daly, where were you
yesterday afternoon?

00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:11,617
Playing nickel
slots downtown.

00:18:11,684 --> 00:18:14,620
I, uh.... I'm
not trying to win

00:18:14,687 --> 00:18:15,854
the big jackpot
or anything

00:18:15,921 --> 00:18:16,956
just passing time.

00:18:17,022 --> 00:18:21,293
It relaxes me.

00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,163
Where did you go next?

00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:25,965
Walked in the park.

00:18:26,031 --> 00:18:27,766
Fresh air.

00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:30,302
I'm allergic to smoke.

00:18:30,369 --> 00:18:31,570
Which park?

00:18:31,637 --> 00:18:33,739
One near my apartment.

00:18:33,806 --> 00:18:37,309
Would that be Mesa Valley Park?

00:18:37,376 --> 00:18:38,510
Yeah.

00:18:38,577 --> 00:18:41,380
Then I sat down on a park bench

00:18:41,447 --> 00:18:44,350
and read a copy of the <i>RJ</i>
that I picked out of the trash.

00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:45,584
What's this about?

00:18:45,651 --> 00:18:47,653
Did you go to the
men's room at any time?

00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,822
Only when nature called.

00:18:49,888 --> 00:18:51,991
What did you do there?

00:18:52,057 --> 00:18:54,159
I amused myself.

00:18:54,226 --> 00:18:56,195
What did you do next?

00:18:56,262 --> 00:18:58,197
We found
your blood on the floor.

00:18:58,264 --> 00:19:02,835
I get nosebleeds.

00:19:02,902 --> 00:19:04,270
Too much cocaine
back in the day.

00:19:04,336 --> 00:19:07,840
I'm sure we'll find that
on your medical records.

00:19:09,775 --> 00:19:13,879
( <i>seething</i> )

00:19:13,946 --> 00:19:16,949
My whole damn life is on record.

00:19:17,016 --> 00:19:19,285
So, why don't you look
at the freakin' records, huh?

00:19:19,351 --> 00:19:21,854
You have anger issues, Mr. Daly?

00:19:23,589 --> 00:19:25,791
Yeah.

00:19:25,858 --> 00:19:29,194
Would you take a
seat for me, please.

00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:39,138
What's that cut

00:19:39,204 --> 00:19:40,139
on your hand from?

00:19:40,205 --> 00:19:41,140
Pick the wrong partner?

00:19:41,206 --> 00:19:43,909
No.

00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:54,653
Look, I'll send
the county a buck 50.

00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,422
They can buy a new one.

00:20:00,793 --> 00:20:02,928
You recognize this boy?

00:20:05,598 --> 00:20:08,200
Looks like a kid that this guy
brought into the bathroom

00:20:08,267 --> 00:20:09,868
but I didn't stay to watch.

00:20:09,935 --> 00:20:11,837
Did you get a look at the guy?

00:20:13,739 --> 00:20:15,341
51s fan.

00:20:16,809 --> 00:20:18,577
His cap.

00:20:18,644 --> 00:20:20,546
Las Vegas police
may have a break

00:20:20,613 --> 00:20:22,014
in the case of a missing boy.

00:20:22,081 --> 00:20:23,682
An eyewitness has come forward

00:20:23,749 --> 00:20:25,918
with a more complete
description of the suspect

00:20:25,985 --> 00:20:28,020
<i>Authorities are now</i>
<i>seeking</i> this <i>man</i>

00:20:28,087 --> 00:20:30,889
<i>in connection with the</i>
<i>disappearance yesterday</i>

00:20:30,956 --> 00:20:32,791
of six-year-old
Jesse Matthews.

00:20:32,858 --> 00:20:34,193
Initial reports from the scene

00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:37,763
only mention a man in a blue
cap, but the police artist

00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,198
<i>had a lot more to work with</i>

00:20:39,265 --> 00:20:41,066
<i>after the eyewitness</i>
<i>came forward.</i>

00:20:41,133 --> 00:20:45,070
Uh, uh... I'm ju... I'm just
trying to stay positive.

00:20:45,137 --> 00:20:47,706
and, um, you know,
I know that Jesse'll

00:20:47,773 --> 00:20:49,642
be safe at home again soon. So.

00:20:51,176 --> 00:20:52,478
I know he'll be safe.

00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:55,047
The boy's mother, Karen,
is holding out hope

00:20:55,114 --> 00:20:56,615
that she'll see her son again.

00:20:56,682 --> 00:20:58,651
She's seen tragedy enough.

00:20:58,717 --> 00:20:59,818
Four years ago,

00:20:59,885 --> 00:21:03,689
she lost her husband
in combat in Afghanistan.

00:21:15,568 --> 00:21:16,902
Sorry. Declined again.

00:21:16,969 --> 00:21:18,237
You have another card?

00:21:18,304 --> 00:21:19,738
Aw, come on.

00:21:19,805 --> 00:21:20,873
That's the fourth time.

00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,341
Maybe we got identity
theft-ed or something.

00:21:22,408 --> 00:21:24,009
Hey, hey,
leave that candy alone.

00:21:24,076 --> 00:21:25,010
It could be
the card-reader.

00:21:25,077 --> 00:21:26,011
My manager
be right back.

00:21:26,078 --> 00:21:27,580
If you guys want
to get some coffee

00:21:27,646 --> 00:21:29,014
it's on the house.

00:21:29,081 --> 00:21:30,616
Las Vegas Police.

00:21:30,683 --> 00:21:32,017
You're under arrest.
What?

00:21:32,084 --> 00:21:33,519
That's the kid
from the news, right?

00:21:33,586 --> 00:21:34,520
Yeah. You did good.

00:21:34,587 --> 00:21:35,854
Yeah, what the hell
is going on here?

00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:37,856
Hey, let go of me.
What are you
arresting us for? Huh?

00:21:37,923 --> 00:21:39,558
What's going on?
What are you
arresting us for?!

00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:40,559
Get away from him.

00:21:40,626 --> 00:21:41,427
Get away
from him!

00:21:41,493 --> 00:21:42,261
It's all right, son.

00:21:42,328 --> 00:21:43,896
You're safe now..

00:21:45,898 --> 00:21:47,566
God, where is he?

00:21:47,633 --> 00:21:49,201
He's in with
a social worker. He's okay.

00:21:49,268 --> 00:21:50,970
Jesse!

00:21:51,036 --> 00:21:52,871
Oh, Jesse, thank God.

00:21:52,938 --> 00:21:55,274
Thank God you're okay.

00:21:55,341 --> 00:21:56,709
No, no, no, it's okay.

00:21:56,775 --> 00:21:58,177
Mommy is here.
You're safe now.

00:21:58,244 --> 00:21:58,844
Mommy!

00:21:58,911 --> 00:22:00,646
Mommy! Mommy!
Adam! Adam!

00:22:00,713 --> 00:22:02,681
KAREN:
No, your mommy's
here, honey.

00:22:02,748 --> 00:22:04,049
WOMAN:
Get away
from my kid!

00:22:04,116 --> 00:22:05,217
What did they say to you?

00:22:05,284 --> 00:22:06,785
What did they make you say,
sweetheart?

00:22:06,852 --> 00:22:08,654
Look at me.
Don't say nothing to nobody.

00:22:08,721 --> 00:22:10,456
You hear me,
little man, huh?

00:22:10,522 --> 00:22:12,124
KAREN:
Don't look
at those people.

00:22:12,191 --> 00:22:13,659
Just look at me.
Just look right here.

00:22:13,726 --> 00:22:15,060
Jim?

00:22:15,127 --> 00:22:16,328
What the hell's going on?

00:22:16,395 --> 00:22:17,529
That's Victor
and Valerie Esposito.

00:22:17,596 --> 00:22:20,366
Transplants from Jersey.

00:22:20,432 --> 00:22:21,567
Check this out.

00:22:22,968 --> 00:22:24,470
It was with Mrs. Esposito's

00:22:24,536 --> 00:22:26,171
personal belongings
at booking.

00:22:26,238 --> 00:22:28,007
WILLOWS:
He's got the same scar

00:22:28,073 --> 00:22:31,577
over his eye
as in Karen's photo.

00:22:31,644 --> 00:22:33,646
So this kid has two moms?

00:22:33,712 --> 00:22:35,314
King Solomon threatened
to cut the baby in half.

00:22:35,381 --> 00:22:36,415
What are you going to do?

00:22:36,482 --> 00:22:38,951
King Solomon didn't have
a DNA lab.

00:22:42,888 --> 00:22:48,160
Hey, is it all right
if he goes with CSI Brown

00:22:48,227 --> 00:22:49,161
for a little while?

00:22:49,228 --> 00:22:50,229
It won't be long.

00:22:52,097 --> 00:22:54,066
Okay.

00:22:54,133 --> 00:22:55,334
My name's Warrick.

00:22:55,401 --> 00:22:56,936
You want to go for a walk?

00:22:59,138 --> 00:23:00,573
It's okay, sweetheart.

00:23:00,639 --> 00:23:01,740
He's a friend.

00:23:03,142 --> 00:23:05,344
Come on, we'll have some fun.

00:23:05,411 --> 00:23:06,645
Oh, wait.

00:23:06,712 --> 00:23:08,180
He gets cold.

00:23:11,584 --> 00:23:13,118
Thank you.

00:23:27,375 --> 00:23:30,875
Wow, everybody's so
busy in there, huh?

00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:33,511
I hear you like dinosaurs.

00:23:33,577 --> 00:23:36,146
Which one's your favorite?

00:23:38,282 --> 00:23:41,452
You know what
mine is? T-Rex.

00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:45,256
'Cause he's got teeth
like this big.

00:23:45,322 --> 00:23:49,226
I bet you wouldn't want
him for a pet, would you?

00:23:51,495 --> 00:23:53,864
You want to see
something cool?

00:23:53,931 --> 00:23:55,699
Come over here.

00:24:01,505 --> 00:24:04,708
This is my special
science kit.

00:24:04,775 --> 00:24:07,711
Got all kinds of stuff in here.

00:24:07,778 --> 00:24:09,613
Let me see...
I got rubber gloves.

00:24:11,282 --> 00:24:13,250
Yeah...

00:24:13,317 --> 00:24:14,318
Put that on.

00:24:14,385 --> 00:24:16,020
What else I got in here?

00:24:16,086 --> 00:24:17,254
I got pens

00:24:17,321 --> 00:24:18,455
that turn into flashlights.

00:24:21,859 --> 00:24:23,227
You want to see

00:24:23,294 --> 00:24:24,762
something invisible?

00:24:24,829 --> 00:24:26,330
Go like this.

00:24:31,202 --> 00:24:32,536
See, there's
nothing there, right?

00:24:32,603 --> 00:24:33,704
But take

00:24:33,771 --> 00:24:36,073
my magic wand right here,

00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:38,609
and I put it in my special
magic powder

00:24:38,676 --> 00:24:40,444
like this.

00:24:40,511 --> 00:24:43,447
Watch this.

00:24:43,514 --> 00:24:44,915
What appears

00:24:44,982 --> 00:24:46,951
is our fingerprints.

00:24:47,017 --> 00:24:50,154
Now shine
the flashlight on it.

00:24:51,789 --> 00:24:53,891
Good job.

00:24:53,958 --> 00:24:55,626
Will you be my assistant?

00:24:58,963 --> 00:25:02,666
See, no two people's
fingerprints are alike.

00:25:02,733 --> 00:25:04,268
Just like
no two people's

00:25:04,335 --> 00:25:05,669
spit is the same.

00:25:05,736 --> 00:25:07,771
So if I took
my spit

00:25:08,375 --> 00:25:10,544
like this...

00:25:12,746 --> 00:25:14,047
Now you do it.

00:25:18,418 --> 00:25:20,687
See, even if
I mix them up,

00:25:20,754 --> 00:25:24,858
I have a machine to tell me
which one is mine

00:25:24,925 --> 00:25:27,628
and which one is yours.

00:25:27,694 --> 00:25:29,696
Now, I need you
to tell me something.

00:25:29,763 --> 00:25:32,966
Which one of these

00:25:33,033 --> 00:25:34,902
two pretty ladies

00:25:34,968 --> 00:25:36,737
is your mom?

00:25:36,803 --> 00:25:38,539
That one.

00:25:42,309 --> 00:25:43,844
Thank you.

00:25:43,911 --> 00:25:45,145
Yeah, whatever.

00:25:45,212 --> 00:25:46,713
Can I see Adam now?

00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:49,049
Adam?
Yeah.

00:25:49,116 --> 00:25:50,284
My kid.

00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,652
Well, once our lab
confirms DNA,

00:25:51,718 --> 00:25:54,655
he can go home
with his mother.

00:25:54,721 --> 00:25:56,623
Who the hell
do you think I am?

00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,727
Mrs. Esposito...

00:26:02,296 --> 00:26:04,231
did you adopt Adam?

00:26:04,298 --> 00:26:06,099
Give me a break.

00:26:06,166 --> 00:26:08,702
26 hours in labor.
Finally had a C-section.

00:26:18,542 --> 00:26:19,943
Did you have twins?

00:26:28,125 --> 00:26:30,144
Can I take Jesse home now?

00:26:30,211 --> 00:26:31,979
I need your help

00:26:32,046 --> 00:26:33,915
to tie up
a few loose ends.

00:26:33,981 --> 00:26:36,217
Of course, anything.

00:26:36,284 --> 00:26:37,885
Let's start with
a sample of your DNA.

00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:40,054
What?
We have to follow
procedure

00:26:40,121 --> 00:26:41,789
for everyone's protection.

00:26:41,856 --> 00:26:43,658
In fact, Jesse can't
even be released

00:26:43,725 --> 00:26:45,727
without a positive match.

00:26:45,793 --> 00:26:48,262
He doesn't stay up this late.

00:26:48,329 --> 00:26:49,864
I'll make it a rush, I promise.

00:26:54,535 --> 00:26:56,471
Open your mouth, please.

00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:02,176
WILLOWS:
It's the same kid.

00:27:02,243 --> 00:27:04,278
It's a doppelganger,
with an identical scar.

00:27:04,345 --> 00:27:06,481
He picked Mrs. Esposito.

00:27:06,547 --> 00:27:08,349
WILLOWS:
I know there's cases in which

00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,584
the kidnappers
threatened their victims,

00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:10,952
"Tell them that
I'm your mother

00:27:11,018 --> 00:27:12,587
or I'll kill
your real mom."

00:27:12,653 --> 00:27:14,021
I don't think he's lying.

00:27:14,088 --> 00:27:16,457
I don't think that
Mrs. Esposito's lying either.

00:27:16,524 --> 00:27:18,359
Karen Matthews had

00:27:18,426 --> 00:27:20,194
a house full of photos of him.

00:27:20,261 --> 00:27:22,563
Well, I'm sure the Espositos
do, too.

00:27:25,366 --> 00:27:27,468
There's something off

00:27:27,535 --> 00:27:30,104
about this picture.

00:27:30,171 --> 00:27:31,873
It seems kind
of set up, doesn't it?

00:27:36,611 --> 00:27:38,146
The pixel density's
not the same.

00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:44,852
Where'd she get
this picture of Adam?

00:27:44,919 --> 00:27:46,020
How'd she get it?

00:27:46,087 --> 00:27:47,355
Maybe she's a stalker.

00:27:47,422 --> 00:27:48,990
No, she wouldn't have
stalked us to Cape May.

00:27:49,057 --> 00:27:49,991
This isn't it.

00:27:50,058 --> 00:27:52,160
It's the only shore
we've been to.

00:27:52,226 --> 00:27:53,861
Do you recognize anything
in the picture?

00:27:53,928 --> 00:27:55,696
Yeah, that's the shirt
his Nana gave him

00:27:55,763 --> 00:27:57,632
last summer.
He only wore it that once,

00:27:57,698 --> 00:27:59,133
at our family reunion.

00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,003
Was Karen Matthews there?

00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:04,372
No way.

00:28:04,439 --> 00:28:05,973
Mr. Esposito...

00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,009
several witnesses

00:28:08,076 --> 00:28:10,311
saw a man matching
your description

00:28:10,378 --> 00:28:12,547
at Mesa Valley Park

00:28:12,613 --> 00:28:14,682
when Jesse disappeared.

00:28:14,749 --> 00:28:16,117
Yeah, I'm there all the time.

00:28:16,184 --> 00:28:17,685
We live around the corner.

00:28:17,752 --> 00:28:19,587
We just had Adam's birthday
party there last month.

00:28:19,654 --> 00:28:20,655
Yeah.

00:28:21,458 --> 00:28:23,125
Were you there the day
before yesterday?

00:28:23,125 --> 00:28:25,227
Yeah, with Adam. Yeah.

00:28:25,293 --> 00:28:27,696
You told me you were
taking him for ice cream.

00:28:27,763 --> 00:28:29,197
What were you doing
in the park?

00:28:29,264 --> 00:28:30,899
I had to meet a guy.

00:28:30,966 --> 00:28:33,068
A guy?

00:28:33,135 --> 00:28:34,202
Oh, my God.

00:28:34,269 --> 00:28:35,537
You're putting money
down on a game?

00:28:35,604 --> 00:28:36,972
You promised you quit.
I did,

00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,041
all right?
It's for a guy at work.

00:28:40,409 --> 00:28:42,978
( <i>car horn honking</i> )

00:28:43,045 --> 00:28:44,780
Three-to-one, right?

00:28:47,115 --> 00:28:49,051
Adam.

00:28:50,709 --> 00:28:52,878
Well, you should have just
took him for ice cream.

00:28:55,114 --> 00:28:58,333
So Karen took a picture
of herself at the beach

00:28:58,333 --> 00:29:00,535
and Photoshopped Jesse in.

00:29:00,602 --> 00:29:01,636
Right.

00:29:01,703 --> 00:29:03,605
So if that's really

00:29:03,672 --> 00:29:06,775
Adam Esposito, where did
she get the pictures from?

00:29:06,841 --> 00:29:08,343
Well, let us see.

00:29:09,844 --> 00:29:11,146
Where are you going?

00:29:11,212 --> 00:29:14,883
Image search.

00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:16,875
Family home page.

00:29:16,959 --> 00:29:19,428
My mom wants me to do
one of these for our family.

00:29:20,166 --> 00:29:21,267
Click on

00:29:21,333 --> 00:29:24,637
where it says "Adam's
Birthday Party."

00:29:24,704 --> 00:29:26,639
That one.

00:29:26,706 --> 00:29:29,442
Maybe Karen
found the site.

00:29:29,508 --> 00:29:31,110
Cut out the kid's picture.

00:29:31,177 --> 00:29:34,246
That's Mesa Valley Park.

00:29:34,313 --> 00:29:36,549
Karen Matthews faked
those photos

00:29:36,615 --> 00:29:38,117
that she
gave Catherine.

00:29:38,184 --> 00:29:39,552
How?

00:29:39,618 --> 00:29:41,954
Cut-and-paste.

00:29:42,021 --> 00:29:43,489
The photos that she
got off the Internet.

00:29:43,556 --> 00:29:45,424
The Espositos
told Catherine

00:29:45,491 --> 00:29:47,560
that they were at the park
with their son

00:29:47,626 --> 00:29:49,061
the day Jesse Matthews
disappeared.

00:29:49,128 --> 00:29:50,463
Is that
a coincidence?

00:29:50,529 --> 00:29:53,399
No. My guess is Karen's been
downloading pictures

00:29:53,466 --> 00:29:55,468
from the family Web site
for a while.

00:29:55,534 --> 00:29:57,837
The most recent being from
Mesa Valley Park.

00:29:57,903 --> 00:29:59,338
Could Karen have recognized
the park

00:29:59,405 --> 00:30:01,340
from the pictures
on the Web site?

00:30:01,407 --> 00:30:04,076
Yeah, and she went there
hoping to see him there.

00:30:04,143 --> 00:30:05,845
But she reported him missing.

00:30:05,911 --> 00:30:07,012
That makes no sense.

00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:08,848
Hey, I got the DNA results.

00:30:08,914 --> 00:30:10,616
The boy is Adam Esposito.

00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:11,617
Victor and Valerie

00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:13,052
are his parents.

00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:14,186
There you go, she's lying.

00:30:14,253 --> 00:30:15,221
She doesn't have a son.

00:30:15,287 --> 00:30:16,250
Uh, not quite.

00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:19,208
She's got 13 alleles
in common with the male DNA

00:30:19,208 --> 00:30:20,909
that we got from
the toothbrush exemplar.

00:30:20,976 --> 00:30:22,578
So she does have a son.

00:30:22,644 --> 00:30:23,912
WILLOWS:
I was inside the house.

00:30:23,979 --> 00:30:26,815
Believe me, a kid
does live there.

00:30:28,291 --> 00:30:30,667
And we're still looking
for Jesse Matthews.

00:30:43,083 --> 00:30:44,818
Karen Matthews.

00:30:47,834 --> 00:30:50,083
Can I take Jesse home now?

00:30:50,083 --> 00:30:51,984
I'm afraid not. No.

00:30:52,051 --> 00:30:54,454
The DNA confirms
the boy's not your child.

00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,190
I... That's impossible.

00:30:57,256 --> 00:30:59,192
Your actions

00:30:59,258 --> 00:31:01,594
regarding the Espositos
constitutes stalking

00:31:01,661 --> 00:31:03,763
and possible kidnapping.

00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:05,164
Please go with
this officer.

00:31:05,231 --> 00:31:07,767
No, no...
What have you done with Jesse?

00:31:07,834 --> 00:31:09,168
Ma'am...

00:31:09,235 --> 00:31:10,603
Where is he?
OFFICER:
Ma'am...

00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:11,871
Jesse?
Please, ma'am...

00:31:11,938 --> 00:31:13,306
Jesse? Jesse, where are you?!

00:31:13,373 --> 00:31:14,307
Ma'am, please...

00:31:14,374 --> 00:31:15,675
I need to see my son!

00:31:15,742 --> 00:31:16,676
Jesse!

00:31:16,743 --> 00:31:18,644
Jesse, where are you?!

00:31:18,711 --> 00:31:20,947
Please! Please! Jesse!

00:31:21,014 --> 00:31:23,182
Jesse!

00:31:23,249 --> 00:31:24,517
Jesse, where are you?!

00:31:24,584 --> 00:31:26,619
"Jesse David Matthews.

00:31:26,686 --> 00:31:28,554
"Mother Karen, father Dwight.

00:31:28,621 --> 00:31:30,123
"Born August 31,

00:31:30,189 --> 00:31:31,524
1999."

00:31:31,591 --> 00:31:32,992
I also checked

00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:34,160
for a death certificate.

00:31:34,227 --> 00:31:35,228
Nothing on file.

00:31:35,294 --> 00:31:37,930
These are all in
chronological order.

00:31:37,997 --> 00:31:40,233
Archie confirmed
that all the photos taken

00:31:40,299 --> 00:31:42,001
along the top row
were genuine.

00:31:42,068 --> 00:31:43,369
Up until the photo taken

00:31:43,436 --> 00:31:46,372
at the funeral
in which he was two.

00:31:46,439 --> 00:31:47,707
So, the rest of these were faked

00:31:47,774 --> 00:31:49,308
using Adam Esposito?

00:31:49,375 --> 00:31:50,376
Yeah.

00:31:50,443 --> 00:31:51,911
You talked
to the neighbors.

00:31:51,978 --> 00:31:53,680
What did they say?

00:31:53,746 --> 00:31:55,415
Jesse and Karen kept
to themselves.

00:31:55,481 --> 00:31:57,016
But he was always leaving

00:31:57,083 --> 00:31:58,985
his toys
around outside.
They saw his toys--

00:31:59,052 --> 00:32:00,453
did they see him?

00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:03,523
Well, when I asked, "When was
the last time you saw Jesse?"

00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:05,091
no one remembered
exactly.

00:32:05,158 --> 00:32:06,759
What about his grandparents?

00:32:06,826 --> 00:32:08,361
They haven't seen him
since the funeral.

00:32:08,428 --> 00:32:11,064
Has anyone seen Jesse
since he was two?

00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:14,701
His teachers or a doctor,
baby-sitters...?

00:32:14,767 --> 00:32:16,602
Well, he was home-schooled.

00:32:16,669 --> 00:32:19,339
And we're looking into a doctor
and a sitter.

00:32:19,405 --> 00:32:22,575
Well, I guess we can impound
her car

00:32:22,642 --> 00:32:24,777
and find out if there's
any evidence

00:32:24,844 --> 00:32:26,612
that he was
even in there.

00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:30,049
For four years
she's created

00:32:30,116 --> 00:32:31,551
an elaborate fantasy--

00:32:31,617 --> 00:32:33,086
which collided with reality

00:32:33,152 --> 00:32:35,221
at Mesa Valley Park.

00:32:41,694 --> 00:32:43,062
Jesse.

00:32:46,933 --> 00:32:47,900
Jesse?

00:32:47,967 --> 00:32:49,402
Where are you?!

00:32:49,469 --> 00:32:50,703
Jesse?!

00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:52,872
I suppose she thought it was
her son that was gone

00:32:52,939 --> 00:32:54,407
when she looked back
at that empty swing.

00:32:54,474 --> 00:32:56,075
WILLOWS:
When she couldn't find him,

00:32:56,142 --> 00:32:58,077
she called the police.

00:32:58,144 --> 00:33:01,247
Jesse's been missing
for four years.

00:33:01,314 --> 00:33:04,484
We're chasing a ghost.

00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:06,019
We went to the park.

00:33:06,085 --> 00:33:09,088
I-I brought Jesse's
new jacket.

00:33:09,155 --> 00:33:12,859
He was on the swings
and when I wasn't looking,

00:33:12,925 --> 00:33:15,762
a man in a blue cap took him.

00:33:15,828 --> 00:33:18,031
Karen, tell me what
happened four years ago

00:33:18,097 --> 00:33:19,499
after your husband
was killed.

00:33:22,435 --> 00:33:24,837
I-I... that's a...

00:33:24,904 --> 00:33:27,240
I am not the one
that should be here.

00:33:27,306 --> 00:33:30,076
You should be talking
to the man that took Jesse.

00:33:30,143 --> 00:33:31,477
Did Jesse get sick?

00:33:31,544 --> 00:33:33,546
Was there an accident?

00:33:36,282 --> 00:33:38,284
Karen?

00:33:38,351 --> 00:33:42,155
Did something happen
to Jesse?

00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:46,659
Is Jesse dead?

00:33:46,726 --> 00:33:50,430
You saw him.

00:33:50,496 --> 00:33:55,168
You were... you were there
while I held him in my arms.

00:33:55,234 --> 00:33:56,936
Why are you putting me
through this?

00:33:58,404 --> 00:34:00,573
Tell me. Why?

00:34:03,543 --> 00:34:05,878
So how do we do this?

00:34:05,945 --> 00:34:07,313
Old school.

00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:09,882
Soil probes.

00:34:09,949 --> 00:34:13,920
The probe goes deeper
where the soil's been disturbed.

00:34:16,089 --> 00:34:18,524
SANDERS:
And that's where we dig?

00:34:18,591 --> 00:34:20,993
On the one hand, you really want
to find the body.

00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,795
Give it respect,

00:34:22,862 --> 00:34:25,298
provide closure...

00:34:25,365 --> 00:34:27,133
On the other hand...

00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,403
Yeah.

00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:39,312
She would have buried
the body

00:34:39,379 --> 00:34:42,849
where he would have still
been close to her.

00:34:42,915 --> 00:34:45,451
You know, I'm not
finding any density changes.

00:34:45,518 --> 00:34:47,620
SANDERS:
Me neither.

00:34:55,461 --> 00:34:58,431
Somebody replaced
this fence board right here.

00:34:58,498 --> 00:35:02,035
These other ones look
like they've been chewed on.

00:35:03,603 --> 00:35:07,040
Guy said that Karen freaked out
when his dog barked at her kid.

00:35:07,106 --> 00:35:10,910
Maybe the dog
chewed through the fence.

00:35:12,345 --> 00:35:14,547
There's definitely a change
in density there.

00:35:14,614 --> 00:35:15,748
Let's start digging.

00:35:34,167 --> 00:35:36,202
I found this

00:35:36,269 --> 00:35:37,603
in Karen's medicine chest.

00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:39,038
Olanzapine.

00:35:39,105 --> 00:35:41,374
That's a heavy-duty
antipsychotic.

00:35:41,441 --> 00:35:42,709
Yeah.

00:35:42,775 --> 00:35:45,044
But the prescription
is over four years old.

00:35:45,111 --> 00:35:46,979
I'll have Brass subpoena
her medical records.

00:35:47,046 --> 00:35:50,650
You know, if she was being
treated for psychosis,

00:35:50,717 --> 00:35:52,618
it could explain
all of this,

00:35:52,685 --> 00:35:54,721
because she didn't overlook
a single detail.

00:35:54,787 --> 00:35:56,422
I think she even did
the fingerpaintings.

00:35:56,489 --> 00:35:58,324
It's hard for anyone to let go
of someone they love.

00:35:58,391 --> 00:36:00,560
Yeah.

00:36:00,626 --> 00:36:01,894
After my dad died,

00:36:01,961 --> 00:36:04,797
my mom would still get him
a present every Christmas.

00:36:04,864 --> 00:36:06,833
She'd put it
under the tree.

00:36:06,899 --> 00:36:09,002
Christmas morning,
the wrapping paper would be

00:36:09,068 --> 00:36:11,804
all crumpled up
and, uh...

00:36:11,871 --> 00:36:13,573
the tie or the sweater,
whatever it was,

00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:16,275
would be hanging in the closet.

00:36:16,342 --> 00:36:17,944
How old were you
when he died?

00:36:18,811 --> 00:36:21,080
Nine.

00:36:21,147 --> 00:36:24,417
Little guy.

00:36:24,484 --> 00:36:28,788
I'll get started
in Karen's room.

00:36:28,855 --> 00:36:30,790
He taught botany.

00:36:30,857 --> 00:36:32,959
He, uh...

00:36:33,026 --> 00:36:36,062
came home from school
one hot, humid day,

00:36:36,129 --> 00:36:38,631
laid down on the couch.

00:36:38,698 --> 00:36:39,866
I was watching TV.

00:36:41,834 --> 00:36:44,504
My Mom brought in
some cold drinks...

00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:48,474
but she couldn't wake him up.

00:36:52,111 --> 00:36:53,813
No one would tell me why.

00:37:32,785 --> 00:37:35,988
( <i>over P.A.</i> ):
Nick Stokes, you have
a visitor in Reception.

00:37:36,055 --> 00:37:38,324
Nick Stokes, you have
a visitor in Reception.

00:37:38,391 --> 00:37:40,760
Hey, Hodges.

00:37:40,827 --> 00:37:42,195
Oh, hey, Nick.

00:37:42,261 --> 00:37:43,763
Did you hear you
had a visitor?

00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:46,366
Yeah, and you have a tissue
sample with adherent hairs.

00:37:46,432 --> 00:37:48,601
Examine the hairs and get
the tissue sample to DNA.

00:37:48,668 --> 00:37:49,869
Priority.

00:37:49,936 --> 00:37:51,270
I'll just drop
everything I'm doing.

00:37:51,337 --> 00:37:52,338
Priority,
Nick Stokes.

00:37:52,405 --> 00:37:53,873
You're coming around, Hodges.

00:37:57,677 --> 00:37:59,912
Hey. I, uh,
I have a visitor?

00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:07,253
Kelly?

00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,789
Hi.
Hi.

00:38:09,856 --> 00:38:12,458
You... you got out.

00:38:12,525 --> 00:38:15,428
Couple days ago.

00:38:15,495 --> 00:38:17,263
Mm...

00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:21,634
Parole hearing board
liked my smile.

00:38:27,707 --> 00:38:31,310
You know, I thought I saw you
at a crime scene the other day.

00:38:31,377 --> 00:38:32,545
You did.

00:38:32,612 --> 00:38:33,946
I did?

00:38:34,013 --> 00:38:36,349
Just checking it out.

00:38:38,184 --> 00:38:41,320
You know how,
when you came to see me,

00:38:41,387 --> 00:38:44,457
what you said

00:38:44,524 --> 00:38:46,859
about when I get out,
not taking it with me?

00:38:48,461 --> 00:38:50,697
I've been thinking
a lot about that.

00:38:52,498 --> 00:38:55,435
I wanted you to know.

00:38:56,969 --> 00:38:58,237
You all right?

00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:00,473
Perfect.

00:39:23,997 --> 00:39:26,499
( <i>dog barking</i> )

00:39:35,108 --> 00:39:38,644
That would be Queenie.

00:39:38,711 --> 00:39:39,779
( <i>barking continues</i> )

00:39:39,846 --> 00:39:40,880
Even after four years,

00:39:40,947 --> 00:39:43,182
you'd expect to find some bones.

00:39:43,249 --> 00:39:45,018
There's nothing.

00:39:52,992 --> 00:39:55,395
Jesse liked dinosaurs.

00:40:08,274 --> 00:40:10,543
Let's see what Hodges
can tell us.

00:40:13,713 --> 00:40:16,983
The GCMS soil analysis
found Cadaverine,

00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:20,520
Putrescine and several other
organic compounds.

00:40:20,586 --> 00:40:23,556
Yeah. English, please?

00:40:23,623 --> 00:40:26,859
It means there was a body
buried in Karen's backyard.

00:40:26,926 --> 00:40:29,028
Just too long ago
to get any DNA.

00:40:29,095 --> 00:40:31,230
But Hodges also found
traces of Olanzapine.

00:40:31,297 --> 00:40:33,800
Well, that's interesting,
becasue a warrant came through

00:40:33,866 --> 00:40:35,401
on Karen Matthews'
medical records,

00:40:35,468 --> 00:40:37,003
and after her son was born,

00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:41,541
Karen was treated for
postpartum psychosis,

00:40:41,607 --> 00:40:43,743
which her doctors treated
by prescribing

00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:45,678
Olanzapine.

00:40:45,745 --> 00:40:47,513
Even a small amount
of that stuff

00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:49,048
would be lethal
to a two-year-old.

00:40:49,115 --> 00:40:50,650
Karen is already
mentally fragile

00:40:50,717 --> 00:40:52,218
when her husband is killed.

00:40:52,285 --> 00:40:55,955
She gets into a very heated
argument with the in-laws

00:40:56,022 --> 00:40:58,758
at his funeral,
goes over the deep end,

00:40:58,825 --> 00:41:03,029
poisons Jesse and buries him
in the backyard near the fence.

00:41:03,096 --> 00:41:06,599
BRASS:
<i>But then she digs him up.</i>
<i>Why?</i>

00:41:06,666 --> 00:41:09,936
GRISSOM:
<i>We have evidence to suggest</i>
<i>that the neighbor's dog</i>

00:41:10,003 --> 00:41:11,637
was digging in Karen's backyard.

00:41:11,704 --> 00:41:13,906
The neighbor claims
that Karen

00:41:13,973 --> 00:41:15,274
killed his dog.

00:41:15,341 --> 00:41:18,311
If the dog detected decomp

00:41:18,378 --> 00:41:21,247
and dug near
the grave,

00:41:21,314 --> 00:41:23,449
<i>Karen may have moved the body</i>
<i>to protect him.</i>

00:41:23,516 --> 00:41:25,718
BRASS:
<i>So, where's Jesse's body?</i>

00:41:25,785 --> 00:41:28,121
WILLOWS:
<i>Nick found a patch</i>

00:41:28,187 --> 00:41:30,690
of tissue and hair
in the trunk of Karen's car.

00:41:30,757 --> 00:41:31,991
The DNA matches the toothbrush.

00:41:32,058 --> 00:41:34,594
If Karen doesn't
tell us where to look,

00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,963
I doubt we'll
ever find the body.

00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:39,165
You know, as long as I do this
job, I can never understand

00:41:39,232 --> 00:41:40,833
<i>how a mother</i>
<i>can kill her child.</i>

00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:44,003
GRISSOM:
<i>Euripedes tried to understand</i>
<i>it when he wrote</i> Medea.

00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:48,174
"I will slay my children
without delaying long enough

00:41:48,241 --> 00:41:50,677
to hand them over
to some more savage hand."

00:41:52,412 --> 00:41:55,948
<i>Medea, like Karen,</i>
<i>was a soldier's wife.</i>

00:41:56,015 --> 00:41:58,618
WILLOWS:
<i>His father was a soldier,</i>

00:41:58,685 --> 00:42:00,186
<i>his grandfather was a soldier,</i>

00:42:00,253 --> 00:42:03,956
Karen did not
want that for Jesse.

00:42:04,023 --> 00:42:05,725
Well, it's still murder.

00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:25,375
( <i>faintly</i> ):
Mommy... Mommy!
