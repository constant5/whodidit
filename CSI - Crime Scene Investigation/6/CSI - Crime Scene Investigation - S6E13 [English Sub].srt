00:11:11,784 --> 00:11:13,385
She was in the line
with your mother.

00:11:13,452 --> 00:11:15,554
Mm.

00:11:15,621 --> 00:11:17,723
Maybe Mom fell for
the wrong gangster.

00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:21,493
Lily was a sweet girl.

00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:25,064
But Lois...
she had to be a star.

00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:29,168
A real coal miner's daughter
from Frackville, Pennsylvania.

00:11:29,234 --> 00:11:31,904
But once she met Tony,
she never had to go back.

00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:36,508
You always were a sucker for
a hot dancer, weren't you, Sam?

00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:39,178
Me and Lois-- I love her,

00:11:39,244 --> 00:11:41,747
but I like to be in
the driver's seat.

00:11:41,814 --> 00:11:44,316
Like this dancer
I'm seeing now--

00:11:44,383 --> 00:11:47,586
she's working tonight;
that's why I came stag.

00:11:47,653 --> 00:11:50,155
Must be serious.

00:11:50,222 --> 00:11:54,793
That's the first time
you haven't asked me
how Mom's doing.

00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,929
She's fine, by the way.

00:11:58,731 --> 00:12:01,066
Mr. Jensen.

00:12:01,133 --> 00:12:03,068
I'm Nick Stokes.
I'm with the crime lab.

00:12:03,135 --> 00:12:04,903
I'm familiar with
your daughter's case.

00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:07,439
Sorry for your loss.

00:12:07,506 --> 00:12:09,742
You knew Mr. Constantine, right?

00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,245
Were there any
other friends

00:12:13,312 --> 00:12:15,381
of Mr. Constantine
here tonight?

00:12:15,447 --> 00:12:17,249
Yeah, there were
friends here.

00:12:17,316 --> 00:12:18,717
And enemies.

00:12:18,784 --> 00:12:21,453
You want to elaborate a little
bit more on those enemies?

00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,123
Stokes, you trying to get me
in trouble?

00:12:24,189 --> 00:12:26,225
Hey, man, I'm just trying
to get to the bottom

00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:27,393
of what happened here
tonight.

00:12:27,459 --> 00:12:29,428
Several witnesses said they saw
you leave the room. Alone.

00:12:29,495 --> 00:12:31,363
I went outside to have a
cigarette-- told her I wouldn't

00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:32,698
smoke in the house.

00:12:32,765 --> 00:12:34,767
Filthy habit.
Trying to quit.

00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:36,101
Mm.

00:12:36,168 --> 00:12:38,103
Frickin' cops won't
let me go.

00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:39,471
Yeah.

00:12:41,206 --> 00:12:43,776
Miss Cherry?
Bye-bye.

00:12:43,842 --> 00:12:44,910
I'm with the crime lab.

00:12:44,977 --> 00:12:46,678
I need to ask you
a few questions.

00:12:46,745 --> 00:12:49,515
( <i>scoffs</i> )
( <i>keypad beeping</i> )

00:12:52,785 --> 00:12:54,386
CHERRY:
Hey, it's me. Are they
freaking out backstage?

00:12:54,453 --> 00:12:56,288
What the...?
Excuse me...

00:12:56,355 --> 00:12:58,123
Please?

00:13:04,663 --> 00:13:06,432
Where did you go
when Miss O'Neill

00:13:06,498 --> 00:13:08,367
left the ballroom
earlier this evening?

00:13:08,434 --> 00:13:09,902
Uh, the bathroom.

00:13:09,968 --> 00:13:12,337
Do you recall what time
you came back?

00:13:12,404 --> 00:13:14,907
What, do you punch a clock
every time you take a leak?

00:13:18,177 --> 00:13:20,612
Did you know the victim--
Tim Duke?

00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:21,847
I don't know
anybody, okay?

00:13:21,914 --> 00:13:23,682
My publicist made me
come to this thing.

00:13:23,749 --> 00:13:25,617
I guess Lo-Lo needed
somebody with a pulse, so...

00:13:25,684 --> 00:13:27,953
May I take a look
at your handbag?
I got a show to do.

00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:30,856
I've got 2,000 people waiting
for me right now.

00:13:30,923 --> 00:13:32,791
We can get a warrant,
but you'll get out of here

00:13:32,858 --> 00:13:34,159
faster if you
let me see the bag.

00:13:35,227 --> 00:13:37,296
Get your hands
off of her!

00:13:42,034 --> 00:13:45,270
Well... now I don't need
a warrant.

00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,586
I don't know how that crack
pipe got in my purse, so...

00:14:01,653 --> 00:14:04,083
There. My client denies
the pipe is hers,

00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:06,917
denies any drug use,
doesn't know the victim

00:14:06,917 --> 00:14:08,886
and has no prior relationship
to Miss O'Neill.

00:14:08,953 --> 00:14:10,955
There's nothing to discuss.

00:14:11,021 --> 00:14:12,790
The pipe was in your possession.

00:14:12,856 --> 00:14:15,726
Plus, you were displaying
symptoms of crack use publicly.

00:14:15,793 --> 00:14:18,696
CURTIS:
And you were at a recent party
where the victim, who

00:14:18,762 --> 00:14:20,664
also used crack,

00:14:20,731 --> 00:14:22,833
was working.

00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,268
You admitted to leaving the
ballroom after Miss O'Neill...

00:14:24,335 --> 00:14:26,237
Coincidences don't make
a homicide.

00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:29,240
You recognized Tim Duke
and you needed a fix.

00:14:29,306 --> 00:14:30,841
Come on...
I don't got it.

00:14:30,908 --> 00:14:32,676
I told you before.
Come on, man.

00:14:32,743 --> 00:14:35,412
Look...
Here, man. See?

00:14:35,479 --> 00:14:37,147
What are you gonna give me?
Hey!

00:14:37,214 --> 00:14:39,083
Oh! Really!

00:14:40,251 --> 00:14:41,919
You wiped down the gun
with a handkerchief...

00:14:41,986 --> 00:14:43,754
No one has established
that my client had a gun.

00:14:43,821 --> 00:14:45,356
And you didn't want to be seen
leaving the bedroom,

00:14:45,422 --> 00:14:47,992
so you climbed down the balcony
to rejoin the party.

00:14:48,058 --> 00:14:49,994
Which is how
you scraped your knees.

00:14:53,264 --> 00:14:55,766
( <i>laughing</i> )

00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:57,768
Okay, I'll admit I was outside.

00:14:57,835 --> 00:14:59,570
But...
It's in your best interests
not to...

00:14:59,637 --> 00:15:02,439
It's cool. Um...

00:15:02,506 --> 00:15:05,175
It wasn't just, uh,
Lois's birthday tonight,

00:15:05,242 --> 00:15:07,444
it was also my bodyguard's
birthday,

00:15:07,511 --> 00:15:12,082
and I scraped my knees
giving him his present.

00:15:13,918 --> 00:15:16,420
CURTIS:
You're going to need to cancel
your shows for awhile.

00:15:16,487 --> 00:15:18,923
We're holding you on possession
of paraphernalia,

00:15:18,989 --> 00:15:20,991
and unlawful use.

00:15:21,058 --> 00:15:24,361
What do I have to do
to make you believe me?

00:15:24,428 --> 00:15:27,298
I already had my birthday.

00:15:27,364 --> 00:15:30,534
ROBBINS:
All right, areas
of callus here.

00:15:30,601 --> 00:15:34,038
Old fractures...
ribs...

00:15:34,104 --> 00:15:36,473
This guy must've worked
some pretty rough shifts.

00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,542
That must be the
bullet, right there.

00:15:38,609 --> 00:15:41,879
Yeah, I'll yank it
in autopsy.

00:15:41,946 --> 00:15:43,514
What's that happening all around
the nose area?

00:15:43,581 --> 00:15:44,648
ROBBINS:
It's a nose cage.

00:15:44,715 --> 00:15:47,985
<i>Nose has been wired to the</i>
<i>skull to hold it in place.</i>

00:15:54,158 --> 00:15:57,394
We find them sometimes
in boxers, accident victims...

00:15:57,461 --> 00:15:59,897
You ever see one on a waiter?

00:15:59,964 --> 00:16:02,633
Wow! You know, Lois had
her first sexual experience

00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,269
on her ninth-grade field trip
to the state capitol...

00:16:05,336 --> 00:16:07,004
with the governor.

00:16:07,071 --> 00:16:08,305
I found the bullet hole.

00:16:08,372 --> 00:16:09,840
Could you bring
the Sawzall?

00:16:09,907 --> 00:16:11,742
Well, you know, this place is
a piece of Las Vegas history;

00:16:11,809 --> 00:16:13,344
you don't want to just go
and chop it up.

00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:17,681
It's a crime scene, and there's
evidence under the floor.

00:16:17,748 --> 00:16:20,818
Yeah, but we don't know exactly
where it is, so...

00:16:24,755 --> 00:16:27,191
...I thought
we'd let "Hawkeye" here

00:16:27,258 --> 00:16:28,626
do a little exploration for us.

00:16:28,692 --> 00:16:31,662
Sure.
I wouldn't want to damage

00:16:31,729 --> 00:16:33,297
priceless, 40-year-old
carpeting.

00:16:33,364 --> 00:16:34,298
No.

00:16:34,365 --> 00:16:37,868
( <i>machine whirring</i> )

00:16:55,619 --> 00:16:56,887
What's that say?

00:16:56,954 --> 00:16:58,889
Pull it up.

00:17:03,294 --> 00:17:05,396
Ten grand brick.

00:17:05,462 --> 00:17:07,565
Benjamin bit the bullet.

00:17:07,631 --> 00:17:10,601
"In God We Trust."

00:17:10,668 --> 00:17:14,238
If she has a vault, why is she
keeping cash under the floor?

00:17:14,305 --> 00:17:16,473
No more room under the mattress?

00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:28,452
Easy access in case
you need to rewire.

00:17:36,894 --> 00:17:38,662
Or steal a million.

00:17:44,902 --> 00:17:46,604
Hey.
Hey.

00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:49,139
Mandy got an AFIS hit
off the vic.

00:17:49,206 --> 00:17:53,177
His aka is Tim Duke, but his
real name is Vincent Pullone,

00:17:53,244 --> 00:17:55,412
a one-time Golden Gloves
wannabe.

00:17:55,479 --> 00:17:57,314
That would explain
the prior injuries.

00:17:57,381 --> 00:17:59,116
Yeah, well, so
does his rap sheet.

00:17:59,183 --> 00:18:01,752
The guy was busy: multiple
assaults, theft...

00:18:01,819 --> 00:18:04,388
Is that the
surveillance footage?

00:18:04,455 --> 00:18:05,789
STOKES:
Yeah.

00:18:05,856 --> 00:18:07,791
I've been through the footage
throughout the entire day.

00:18:07,858 --> 00:18:09,426
I've got the party staffers
coming in

00:18:09,493 --> 00:18:10,527
and out the back door.

00:18:10,594 --> 00:18:15,132
But, get this--
same time, different entrance.

00:18:18,836 --> 00:18:20,237
BROWN:
Well, that's our vic.

00:18:20,304 --> 00:18:21,972
STOKES:
Yeah, a couple minutes
later.

00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:25,142
Now, here...

00:18:25,209 --> 00:18:26,977
around the time
of the murder,

00:18:27,044 --> 00:18:32,283
same car... pulls up...
waits.

00:18:32,349 --> 00:18:34,451
Freeze that.
Can you get a plate number?

00:18:34,518 --> 00:18:35,886
Yeah.

00:18:35,953 --> 00:18:37,454
( <i>typing,</i>
<i>computer beeping</i> )

00:18:39,957 --> 00:18:41,225
BROWN:
Nice.

00:18:41,292 --> 00:18:42,393
STOKES:
Nevada 295,

00:18:42,459 --> 00:18:45,362
Ocean, Henry, Union.

00:18:49,266 --> 00:18:51,802

McGinnigle...
McGonigle.

00:18:53,137 --> 00:18:55,072
McGonigle?
McGonigle.

00:18:55,139 --> 00:18:56,674
I'll run it through Brass.

00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:59,510
Handkerchief is linen.
Edging appears to be
hand-stitched.

00:18:59,577 --> 00:19:02,313
Pretty nice rag to be
wiping a gun off with.

00:19:02,379 --> 00:19:04,181
Oh, so it was positive
for gun oil.

00:19:04,248 --> 00:19:07,084
Yeah. And the
diphenylamine test
was also positive

00:19:07,151 --> 00:19:09,653
for oxidizers and partially
burned gunpowder.

00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,789
Uh, negative for
prints or DNA.

00:19:11,855 --> 00:19:16,627
So, Mandy wasn't able
to lift any prints off
of the cash we found.

00:19:16,694 --> 00:19:18,562
Fingerprints are just oil, water
and amino acids, Greg.

00:19:18,629 --> 00:19:19,797
They don't last forever.

00:19:19,863 --> 00:19:20,998
No kidding.

00:19:21,065 --> 00:19:22,833
You ever hear that expression
"old money"?

00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,268
This stuff was ancient--

00:19:24,335 --> 00:19:26,971
some of it's signed by
Eisenhower's Treasury Secretary.

00:19:27,037 --> 00:19:29,373
Series dates
all before 1965.

00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,242
Same with the grand
we found on the vic.

00:19:31,308 --> 00:19:32,810
Ancient?

00:19:32,877 --> 00:19:33,811
( <i>clattering in distance</i> )

00:19:33,878 --> 00:19:36,580
O'NEILL:
Set them down...

00:19:41,619 --> 00:19:43,988
GRISSOM:
Miss O'Neill!
Nice to see you.

00:19:44,054 --> 00:19:45,823
What's all this?

00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:47,591
An army travels on its stomach.

00:19:47,658 --> 00:19:50,661
I wanted you and your people
to know how grateful I am

00:19:50,728 --> 00:19:53,297
for all you've done for me.
Well, thank you.

00:19:53,364 --> 00:19:56,233
But, uh, we can't accept
anything that might influence

00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,168
the outcome of the case--
it's our policy.

00:19:58,235 --> 00:19:59,637
Oh, come on.

00:19:59,703 --> 00:20:02,640
Cold cuts...
a little shrimp salad.

00:20:02,706 --> 00:20:04,475
Shrimp salad...
( <i>clicks tongue</i> )

00:20:04,542 --> 00:20:05,943
I know what we can do.

00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:07,578
Have your boys
take it down the street

00:20:07,645 --> 00:20:08,779
to the St. Vincent
homeless shelter.

00:20:08,846 --> 00:20:10,180
They need it more than we do.

00:20:10,247 --> 00:20:12,816
Well... ( <i>huffs</i> )

00:20:19,256 --> 00:20:21,191
Having fun
with my book, Greg?

00:20:21,258 --> 00:20:23,861
Oh, yeah.
That beach party...

00:20:23,928 --> 00:20:25,829
Hoo-hoo-hoo.
Marilyn Monroe and
the President...

00:20:25,896 --> 00:20:27,765
Swing-a-ding-ding.

00:20:30,401 --> 00:20:32,870
By the way, Miss O'Neill, we
made an interesting discovery

00:20:32,937 --> 00:20:34,605
under the floor
of your bedroom.

00:20:34,672 --> 00:20:37,241
I was hoping you
could tell us about it.

00:31:02,172 --> 00:31:05,842
And I had dinner
at Drai's with the girls.

00:31:05,909 --> 00:31:08,512
Filet to die for.

00:31:08,579 --> 00:31:10,881
Drai's...

00:31:10,948 --> 00:31:14,451
The girls like to spend.

00:31:14,518 --> 00:31:17,854
( <i>sneezes</i> )

00:31:17,921 --> 00:31:20,924
Red wine always makes me
two of the Seven Dwarfs:

00:31:20,991 --> 00:31:22,292
Sleepy and Sneezy.

00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:23,794
( <i>sniffs</i> )

00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:26,129
Where did you get
that hanky?

00:31:26,196 --> 00:31:27,831
A friend.

00:31:29,666 --> 00:31:32,102
A friend who was at Lois' party?

00:31:32,169 --> 00:31:33,170
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:31:33,236 --> 00:31:35,339
Now don't get mad, Catherine.

00:31:35,405 --> 00:31:36,907
You can't be
seeing Sam?

00:31:36,974 --> 00:31:38,642
And why not?

00:31:38,709 --> 00:31:39,910
Oh, for one thing,
he's a player.

00:31:39,977 --> 00:31:42,679
I don't expect monogamy
from him.

00:31:42,746 --> 00:31:43,981
I can't believe this.

00:31:44,047 --> 00:31:46,717
And I am not promising that
he'll get it from me, either.

00:31:46,783 --> 00:31:48,685
What are you doing?

00:31:48,752 --> 00:31:51,088
Put it in the envelope.
Why?!

00:31:51,154 --> 00:31:53,156
Because we haven't cleared
Sam as a suspect.

00:31:53,223 --> 00:31:54,825
He can't be!

00:31:54,891 --> 00:31:58,428
He has been so wonderful to me
these past few weeks.

00:31:58,495 --> 00:32:01,732
Oh, this has been going on
for weeks, huh?

00:32:01,798 --> 00:32:04,201
We have a history together,
Catherine.

00:32:04,268 --> 00:32:08,272
We were young together.

00:32:08,338 --> 00:32:10,674
Some day, maybe
you'll understand.

00:32:15,579 --> 00:32:17,814
( <i>siren blares</i> )

00:32:34,698 --> 00:32:37,167
You want to see
me, Muggs,

00:32:37,234 --> 00:32:39,036
all you need
is a phone.

00:32:39,102 --> 00:32:43,307
You lied about being
in Lois O'Neill's bedroom.

00:32:43,373 --> 00:32:46,209
I was in that bedroom once.

00:32:46,276 --> 00:32:48,679
In 1967.

00:32:48,745 --> 00:32:50,781
As a gentleman,

00:32:50,847 --> 00:32:53,317
I would prefer not going
into details.

00:32:53,383 --> 00:32:58,422
Your handkerchief puts you there
when the waiter was shot.

00:33:00,724 --> 00:33:02,926
One of these?

00:33:05,762 --> 00:33:09,466
Lois and I were going over
old times.

00:33:09,533 --> 00:33:12,836
She got a little weepy.

00:33:15,872 --> 00:33:20,143
What she did with it
after that, I don't know.

00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:22,913
My housekeeper made me
a dozen for Christmas.

00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,314
I've only got half left.

00:33:24,381 --> 00:33:27,684
So quit giving them away.

00:33:30,721 --> 00:33:34,725
Oh... you're mothering me.

00:33:37,461 --> 00:33:39,796
You know, Sam,

00:33:39,863 --> 00:33:42,866
this is the second time
that I thought

00:33:42,933 --> 00:33:44,835
that you might be
a killer.

00:33:44,901 --> 00:33:46,069
Come on,

00:33:46,136 --> 00:33:48,205
you know better.

00:33:48,272 --> 00:33:50,641
The thing is, I don't.

00:33:52,576 --> 00:33:54,478
It never occurred to me
for a minute

00:33:54,544 --> 00:33:57,681
that this is something
that you wouldn't have done.

00:33:57,748 --> 00:33:59,583
And that wouldn't bother me,

00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:02,185
except you're dating my mother.

00:34:02,252 --> 00:34:03,387
Look,

00:34:03,453 --> 00:34:07,791
I'm being good
to Lil this time around.

00:34:07,858 --> 00:34:11,128
Give us a chance.

00:34:12,796 --> 00:34:15,465
Give me a chance.

00:34:15,532 --> 00:34:17,534
You'll see.

00:34:17,601 --> 00:34:18,936
Making up for stabbing
one showgirl

00:34:19,002 --> 00:34:21,872
by being kind
to another. Hmm.

00:34:21,939 --> 00:34:26,209
If you weren't my daughter...

00:34:26,276 --> 00:34:27,711
What?

00:34:27,778 --> 00:34:30,814
What would you do, Sam?

00:34:37,254 --> 00:34:39,389
( <i>door slams shut</i> )

00:34:51,068 --> 00:34:54,204
Vanity, thy name is Hodges.

00:34:54,271 --> 00:34:57,107
This isn't
what it looks like.

00:34:57,174 --> 00:34:59,209
I actually like
my gray hair.

00:34:59,276 --> 00:35:01,078
The few that I have.

00:35:01,144 --> 00:35:03,513
Hodges, don't you know
that gray hair

00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:05,949
can be very attractive?

00:35:06,016 --> 00:35:07,684
The ring?

00:35:07,751 --> 00:35:09,386
The ring?

00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:11,622
The ring.

00:35:11,688 --> 00:35:16,293
The ring was positive
for GSR.

00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,829
That means Lois
could be the shooter.

00:35:22,232 --> 00:35:24,701
I guess we'll have
to bring her in.

00:35:29,706 --> 00:35:32,009
One of your guys take
the crime scene tape down?

00:35:32,075 --> 00:35:34,878
Sara and Catherine
cleared the scene
about two hours ago.

00:35:42,552 --> 00:35:45,222
Miss O'Neill,
Las Vegas Police.

00:35:56,099 --> 00:35:58,802
Miss O'Neill?

00:35:59,703 --> 00:36:02,372
♪ ♪

00:36:21,925 --> 00:36:25,128
♪ ♪

00:36:44,166 --> 00:36:45,634
SANDERS:
Wow, it's the end of an era.

00:36:45,701 --> 00:36:48,637
From the containment
of the blood,

00:36:48,704 --> 00:36:51,540
it appears she was shot
while lying down.

00:36:51,606 --> 00:36:53,375
Asleep...

00:36:53,442 --> 00:36:56,044
or surprised by
someone she trusted?

00:36:56,111 --> 00:36:59,414
Nick just found out
that Tim Duke's airline tickets

00:36:59,481 --> 00:37:01,483
were purchased by
a credit card

00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:03,352
under the name
of Double-X Associates.

00:37:03,418 --> 00:37:05,120
That's Lois O'Neill's company.

00:37:05,187 --> 00:37:06,521
How do you know that?

00:37:06,588 --> 00:37:08,523
She was the double-kiss girl.

00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:09,958
SANDERS:
Yeah, you can't
say her name

00:37:10,025 --> 00:37:11,560
without kissing twice.

00:37:11,626 --> 00:37:13,762
Lois O'Neill--

00:37:13,829 --> 00:37:15,864
Kiss-kiss. XX.

00:37:15,931 --> 00:37:18,200
Huh.

00:37:18,266 --> 00:37:20,602
Well, Nick also found out
that the only two names

00:37:20,669 --> 00:37:25,407
authorized to sign on that card,
were Lois O'Neill

00:37:25,474 --> 00:37:27,409
and Eve Girard.

00:37:32,781 --> 00:37:34,216
She looks perfect, doesn't she?

00:37:34,282 --> 00:37:36,752
Except for these smudges
on her eyelids.

00:38:13,455 --> 00:38:14,723
Grissom,

00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:16,258
you know I was
looking into

00:38:16,325 --> 00:38:18,126
that Pan Am heist
in '65?

00:38:18,193 --> 00:38:19,728
On your own time, I hope.

00:38:19,795 --> 00:38:21,129
It's related
to our case.

00:38:21,196 --> 00:38:23,532
I just got off the phone
with the FBI lab at Quantico.

00:38:23,598 --> 00:38:25,667
Bobby Dawson
sent them ballistics

00:38:25,734 --> 00:38:27,202
on the gun we found
on Tim Duke.

00:38:27,269 --> 00:38:28,270
And?

00:38:28,337 --> 00:38:30,105
It's a match to the gun
that was used

00:38:30,172 --> 00:38:31,907
to kill a guard
in the Pan Am heist.

00:38:31,973 --> 00:38:34,242
So I sent them serials
on the cash we found.

00:38:34,309 --> 00:38:35,944
Also a match
to the Pan Am heist?

00:38:36,011 --> 00:38:38,046
Right-o, daddy-o.

00:38:38,113 --> 00:38:39,247
Congratulations, Greg.

00:38:42,184 --> 00:38:45,287
This is Doc Robbins' preliminary
autopsy report

00:38:45,354 --> 00:38:47,589
on Lois O'Neill.

00:38:47,656 --> 00:38:50,625
When he opened her up, he found
that her body was riddled

00:38:50,692 --> 00:38:53,128
with advanced tumors.

00:38:53,195 --> 00:38:55,163
Wow.

00:38:57,366 --> 00:38:59,801
She knew she was
going to die.

00:38:59,868 --> 00:39:01,970
That's why she
wrote the book,

00:39:02,037 --> 00:39:04,306
'cause she knew that
if she was gone,

00:39:04,373 --> 00:39:06,308
there'd be nobody left
to tell the true story.

00:39:06,375 --> 00:39:08,944
You read it.

00:39:09,011 --> 00:39:11,279
Do you think that's how
she wanted to go out?

00:39:11,346 --> 00:39:12,748
No.

00:39:12,814 --> 00:39:19,121
But, uh...
looking beautiful-- yeah.

00:39:19,187 --> 00:39:21,990
In all the papers-- yeah.

00:39:22,057 --> 00:39:23,325
Murdered...

00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:26,795
Only if she was the one
who called the shots.

00:39:26,862 --> 00:39:28,664
Yeah.

00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:30,499
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:39:30,565 --> 00:39:32,768
Oh, we had some good times.

00:39:32,834 --> 00:39:36,271
You knew she had cancer?
No, she had guts.

00:39:36,338 --> 00:39:39,041
She staged her exit
like a pro.

00:39:39,107 --> 00:39:42,277
The book, the party...

00:39:42,344 --> 00:39:45,180
She only made one mistake--
she hired an amateur.

00:39:45,247 --> 00:39:46,982
Tim Duke?

00:39:47,049 --> 00:39:48,717
Also known as Vincent Pullone?

00:39:48,784 --> 00:39:52,654
A wimp and a thief.

00:39:52,721 --> 00:39:55,090
Lois would give you
all the cookies you wanted,

00:39:55,157 --> 00:39:57,326
but you stuck your hand
in the cookie jar...

00:39:59,895 --> 00:40:00,896
she'd chop it off.

00:40:02,698 --> 00:40:05,734
Try to relax, honey.

00:40:05,801 --> 00:40:07,936
This'll be easy.

00:40:08,003 --> 00:40:10,672
I'll be on the bed,
one shot.

00:40:10,739 --> 00:40:13,742
Don't be sloppy.

00:40:23,285 --> 00:40:25,187
What the hell?
What do you care?

00:40:25,253 --> 00:40:27,689
You're going
to be dead anyway.

00:40:27,756 --> 00:40:30,792
Nobody steals from me.

00:40:46,241 --> 00:40:48,677
Why'd she ask Duke, not you?

00:40:48,744 --> 00:40:51,546
She didn't want to involve
an old friend.

00:40:51,613 --> 00:40:53,115
Until yesterday.

00:40:53,181 --> 00:40:56,284
BRASS:
Yesterday afternoon,
Lois O'Neill wired

00:40:56,351 --> 00:40:58,620
$250,000 to your sister
in Sarasota.

00:40:58,687 --> 00:41:00,989
Now you were Tony C's driver.

00:41:01,056 --> 00:41:04,259
The only one he trusted
to bodyguard Miss O'Neill.

00:41:04,326 --> 00:41:08,463
You took care of her
right until the end.

00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:11,433
Well, who else do I have
to take care of?

00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,702
My guess is she offered
you the money,

00:41:13,769 --> 00:41:15,704
but being a friend
you refused.

00:41:15,771 --> 00:41:17,639
So she sent it
to your sister instead.

00:41:21,309 --> 00:41:24,646
( <i>chuckles softly</i> )

00:41:24,713 --> 00:41:27,482
She sent it to my sister.

00:41:27,549 --> 00:41:29,317
You know,

00:41:29,384 --> 00:41:33,422
you've got a choice

00:41:33,488 --> 00:41:38,527
between checking out
all shriveled up, in a hospital,

00:41:38,593 --> 00:41:43,498
or at home, looking like
a million bucks.

00:41:43,565 --> 00:41:47,069
Any guy who'd do that
for a good friend,

00:41:47,135 --> 00:41:51,606
he's okay by me.

00:41:53,909 --> 00:41:59,514
If you see Tony, tell him
I love him.

00:41:59,581 --> 00:42:02,984
Doll...

00:42:03,051 --> 00:42:06,625
you're going to see him
before I do.
