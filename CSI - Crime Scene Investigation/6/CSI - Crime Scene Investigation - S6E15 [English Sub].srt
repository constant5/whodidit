00:00:26,996 --> 00:00:29,799
( <i>indistinct police</i>
<i>radio transmission</i> )

00:00:35,128 --> 00:00:37,430
Guy was on his way
to a landscaping job

00:00:37,497 --> 00:00:39,265
in Palm Springs.

00:00:39,332 --> 00:00:42,168
Saw a body sticking
out of the sand.

00:00:42,235 --> 00:00:45,738
Well, out this far,
it's probably a body dump.

00:00:45,805 --> 00:00:49,142
Looks like they starved
her to death first.

00:00:52,378 --> 00:00:54,480
Well, Jesus fasted
in the desert.

00:00:54,547 --> 00:00:56,716
Yeah, but he had a choice.

00:00:56,782 --> 00:00:57,950
No clothes, no shoes,

00:00:58,017 --> 00:00:59,852
no hair.

00:00:59,919 --> 00:01:01,154
BRASS:
Maybe her dome was shaved

00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,022
'cause she spent time
in the pen.

00:01:03,089 --> 00:01:04,490
No right hand either.

00:01:04,557 --> 00:01:05,491
Could have been

00:01:05,558 --> 00:01:07,293
disarticulated
by a wild animal.

00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,629
The only wild animal was
the one who left her out here.

00:01:11,211 --> 00:01:12,586
Hey, Grissom.

00:01:13,366 --> 00:01:14,534
Conditions are less than ideal.

00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,869
Is it okay if we just do
a scoop and run?

00:01:16,936 --> 00:01:21,541
Yeah, David, shoe prints,
tire treads-- all they are is...

00:01:21,607 --> 00:01:22,875
Dust in the wind.

00:01:30,616 --> 00:01:32,952
Looks like she was branded.

00:01:33,019 --> 00:01:34,887
Emaciated, bald, and numbered.

00:01:34,954 --> 00:01:37,056

PHILLIPS:

00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:16,169
A brand is a kind
of contract.

00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:17,637
STOKES:
Tell that to a bull

00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:20,407
when he gets stuck on
his rear with a hot iron.

00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,542
In that case, it signifies
ownership.

00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:24,444
To a Maori tribesman,
or a Marine,

00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:25,645
it signifies belonging.

00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:26,946
Did you get a liver temp?

00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:29,449
Couldn't get
an accurate reading.

00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:31,351
You want me to pull
vitreous from the eye?
Yeah.

00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:32,686
One eye is much more desiccated
than the other.

00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:34,621
Could be an infection.

00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:36,122
Take samples from both.

00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:39,025
The eye is sequestered space.

00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:40,860
Changes that happen in the blood
after death,

00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:42,729
happen more slowly
in the vitreous.

00:02:42,796 --> 00:02:44,564
Could give us more
accurate levels.

00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:58,578
Um... Dr. Robbins...

00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:02,215
The optic nerve's been severed.

00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:03,917
That kind of defeats the purpose

00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:05,552
of an eye transplant,
doesn't it?

00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:06,920
An eye transplant's
just the cornea;

00:03:06,987 --> 00:03:08,621
it's not the whole eye.

00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:11,024
David,
check the other eye.

00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:18,932
This one's
still connected.

00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:19,966
Clip it.

00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,401
Nick, send both eyes

00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:24,104

It's been a long,
strange trip

00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:28,835
for this poor girl.

00:04:28,902 --> 00:04:31,972
I found puncture wounds
around her glandular areas,

00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:33,873
from large-gauge needles
commonly used

00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,408
to draw out fluids.

00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:38,812
Maybe she was undergoing some
kind of medical treatment.

00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:39,913
What's in this?

00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,314
I'm not sure.

00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:42,415
I found it in her teeth.

00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:43,483
Could be from her last meal.

00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,618
Also, another
surprise:

00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:46,753
She had a D &amp; C.

00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:47,754
Abortion?

00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:49,889
Maybe polyps, hyperplasia.

00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,424
Infection?
And how.

00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:53,693
Starvation shrinks
a lot of things,

00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,395
but not your organs.

00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:59,065
They're all abscessed.

00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,534
Which explains why I couldn't
find the liver.

00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:03,069
There's not much left.

00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,505
What, some kind of flesh-eating
disease?

00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:07,440
Necrotizing faciitis.

00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:09,342
I've never seen
anything like this.

00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:12,212
<i>Typically streptococcus enters</i>
<i>through an open wound</i>

00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:14,014
<i>and starts eating</i>
<i>through the skin.</i>

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,016
<i>Then uses the blood stream</i>
<i>as a conduit</i>

00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:18,151
<i>to reach the internal organs.</i>

00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:23,923
In her case, the bacteria
started in her blood stream.

00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,725
Means her skin is fine.

00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:29,129
Maybe the puncture wounds were
used to put something in,

00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:31,531
rather than take something out.

00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:33,867
So Henry found oxycodone
and chlorpromazine

00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:35,535
in both the right
and left eye.

00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:36,603
Now, one kills pain

00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,471
and the other puts
a lid on panic.

00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:40,974
Chlorpromazine-- they give
that to mental patients.

00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:43,443
Yeah, but this gets
so much weirder.

00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,045
Because that dried up eyeball--

00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:47,147
it actually belongs
to somebody else.

00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:49,249
What?

00:05:49,316 --> 00:05:51,117
See, the vitreous fluid
from her eyeball showed

00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,752
that she'd only been
dead for a day;

00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:55,155
but the DNA from the other
eyeball, well, it was male,

00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:56,990
and it seems to have been
separated from its owner

00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:58,458
for about a week.

00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:01,761
So, I ran it
through CODIS.

00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:03,229
And the eyeball belonged

00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:04,464
to a Jack Landers,

00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:07,233
who is a convicted
sex offender.

00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,570
Would sticking your eyeball
in a woman's eye socket

00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:12,505
constitute a sex offense?

00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:14,307
Well, rape is legally defined

00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:18,078
as putting an unwanted foreign
object into a genital opening.

00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:20,680
So sexual... no...

00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:24,084
But offensive... yeah.

00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,920
Look, guy got out of jail
six weeks ago.

00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:28,955
A weenie wagger
with two eyes.

00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:31,758
As a parolee, he has to check
in with me once a month.

00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:33,360
Missed our last appointment,

00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:34,894
but before I could file
the paperwork,

00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:37,130
he showed up here, across
from his halfway house,

00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:39,132
thinking he's
Captain Crunch.

00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:42,769
They thought he was
piped up on something,

00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:44,104
but his urine was clean

00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,605
and his high
hasn't faded.

00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:48,041
Hey, Jack.

00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:51,144
Captain Jack to you.

00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:55,615
Ahoy, mateys.

00:06:55,682 --> 00:06:57,517
Captain Jack,
these people want

00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:59,352
to ask you
some questions.

00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,655
Orphaned at the age
of five.

00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:05,325
Stowed away on the
<i>Good Ship Lollipop.</i>

00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:07,394
The sea...

00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,796
is an evil mistress.

00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:15,969
Spit me out and fed me
to the beast.

00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:22,709
A puppet I am.

00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,218
STOKES:
<i>Hey, Sara, got your message.</i>

00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,687
No AFIS hits
on my Jane Doe.

00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:34,954
So I put a bulletin out

00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:37,023
to surrounding agencies
and the media.

00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,659
Maybe somebody will
recognize her from the photo.

00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:40,960
Where you at right now?

00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:42,996
On the train
to Crazyville.

00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:44,998
Did you get a peek
under the patch?

00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:47,400
No, no. I left that

00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,636
for the doctor.

00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:52,272
Jack, look
this way.
( <i>Jack mumbling</i> )

00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:54,441
I need you to sit
still for me.
Where's my patch?

00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:56,376
Come on, look this way.
Draw my sword...

00:07:56,443 --> 00:07:58,378
make you walk the plank.

00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,281
Jack, were you in an accident

00:08:01,348 --> 00:08:02,916
or a recent fight?

00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:06,619
Captain Jack don't do
much recallin'.

00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:09,456
Did he have an ocular tumor,
or recent surgery?

00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:11,291
I have no idea.

00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:12,792
He's a suspect in
a murder investigation.

00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:16,262
Do you think
he's crazy, or...?

00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,398
I think he's been lobotomized.

00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:21,401
Jack, I want you
to undress and
put this on for me.

00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:24,337
I want to do a CT scan
to confirm,

00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:25,739
but in the '30s and '40s

00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:28,441
lobotomies were often
done via the eye socket.

00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,744
Right, right, but lobotomies--
they're not

00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,178
common practice
today?

00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:33,246
Hardly.

00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:35,248
Nick...

00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:37,817
Take a look
at his arm.

00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:43,223
He's not a suspect;
he's a victim.

00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:48,094
Jane Doe is number 19.

00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:55,001
I know it's tough, but
we're going to need you

00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:56,836
to identify
the body.

00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:58,471
Fine.

00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,140
Someone from
the coroner's
office will

00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,141
get in touch with you.

00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,777
For reasons I think
we both understand,

00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:05,478
I would appreciate
some level of anonymity.

00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,481
Sure, I'll do my best.

00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,118
Thank you,
Captain Brass.

00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:14,020
Thanks for coming in.

00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:40,347
BRASS:
The Jane Doe
is Zoe Kessler.

00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,753
Her mother saw
her picture on the news

00:09:41,753 --> 00:09:44,255
and identified her
as her estranged daughter.

00:09:44,322 --> 00:09:46,257
I did a DMV check,

00:09:46,324 --> 00:09:48,059
and I have the victim's
last known address.

00:09:48,126 --> 00:09:49,594
Good. I'll come with you.

00:09:49,661 --> 00:09:50,728
There's something
you should know.

00:09:50,795 --> 00:09:52,263
The mother's a friend
of yours.

00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:53,665
Who's that?

00:09:53,731 --> 00:09:54,766
Lady Heather.

00:10:04,142 --> 00:10:06,377
Apartment 106.

00:10:06,444 --> 00:10:10,248
Landlord was getting
ready to evict her.

<i>Briefe an einen jungen Dichter.</i>

00:10:42,814 --> 00:10:45,416
Nothing sounds good in German.

00:10:45,483 --> 00:10:49,087
How did she get from Harvard
to here?

00:10:49,153 --> 00:10:51,489
Practice, practice, practice.

00:10:51,556 --> 00:10:53,591
How do you know
she was at Harvard?

00:10:53,658 --> 00:10:55,026
Lady Heather told me.

00:10:55,093 --> 00:10:56,494
She was very proud of her.

00:10:58,696 --> 00:11:00,899
Well, it looks as though

00:11:00,965 --> 00:11:03,268
she hasn't checked her mail
in ten weeks.

00:11:03,334 --> 00:11:04,969
The postmark dates back
to November 12th.

00:11:05,036 --> 00:11:06,404
BRASS:
She died yesterday.

00:11:06,471 --> 00:11:08,206
Where's she been all this time?

00:11:09,807 --> 00:11:11,242
This looks like an appointment.

00:11:11,309 --> 00:11:13,811
"Betz, 11-12, 7:00 P.M."

00:11:13,878 --> 00:11:16,181

First message:

00:11:16,247 --> 00:11:18,249
WOMAN 1:
Hi, this is Audrey
at the Betz Clinic.

00:11:18,316 --> 00:11:20,485
We're just calling
to see how you're feeling.

00:11:20,552 --> 00:11:22,086
Give us a call.

00:11:22,153 --> 00:11:23,354
Second message:

00:11:23,421 --> 00:11:24,989
Hi, this is Audrey
at the Betz Clinic.

00:11:25,056 --> 00:11:26,157
We didn't hear from you,

00:11:26,224 --> 00:11:27,926
and we have some followup
questions about your tests.

00:11:27,992 --> 00:11:29,027
Please call us.

00:11:29,093 --> 00:11:32,297
Third message:

00:11:32,363 --> 00:11:33,131
WOMAN 2:
This is Citibank.

00:11:33,198 --> 00:11:34,165
We're trying
to reach Zoe Kessler.

00:11:34,232 --> 00:11:35,767
Betz Clinic?

00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:37,202
Yeah. I'll check it out.

00:11:37,268 --> 00:11:41,873
...at 1-800-555-01...

00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,341
Heterochromia.

00:11:43,408 --> 00:11:48,279
It appears Zoe had one blue eye
and one brown eye.

00:11:48,346 --> 00:11:49,881
The pirate had one blue eye.

00:12:05,864 --> 00:12:07,699
What happened to her?

00:12:07,765 --> 00:12:10,001
We're trying
to find out.

00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:17,041
May I touch her?

00:12:17,108 --> 00:12:18,843
Go ahead.

00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:35,994
This required skill...

00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,763
and the infliction of pain.

00:12:42,734 --> 00:12:44,936
Did you shave her head?

00:12:45,003 --> 00:12:47,839
No, she was found like this.

00:12:47,906 --> 00:12:52,210
Can you tell
if she's ever given birth?

00:12:52,277 --> 00:12:55,446
There was some scarring
on her pelvic bones,

00:12:55,513 --> 00:12:57,515
but given the condition
of the body,

00:12:57,582 --> 00:12:59,417
it's hard to say for sure.

00:12:59,484 --> 00:13:02,554
She always wore her
grandmother's ring

00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:05,623
on her right hand.

00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:07,158
Did you find it?

00:13:15,133 --> 00:13:17,035
Hi.

00:13:21,406 --> 00:13:23,641
I'm so sorry
about your loss.

00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:26,277
But you need to ask me
some questions.

00:13:26,344 --> 00:13:30,415
I'd like to know some things
about your daughter.

00:13:30,481 --> 00:13:32,717
When was the last
time you saw her?

00:13:32,784 --> 00:13:36,154
She dropped out of school
about a year ago.

00:13:36,221 --> 00:13:38,723
I didn't even know
she was in town.

00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:41,092
So you weren't in contact
with her?

00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:42,126
No.

00:13:42,193 --> 00:13:43,561
Can you tell me why?

00:13:43,628 --> 00:13:45,496
What difference
does it make now?

00:13:50,835 --> 00:13:52,971
Did she have any
medical conditions?

00:13:53,037 --> 00:13:54,806
Not that I know of.

00:13:54,873 --> 00:13:58,109
Because in November,

00:13:58,176 --> 00:14:00,278
she participated
in a medical study

00:14:00,345 --> 00:14:02,780
at the Betz Clinic.

00:14:02,847 --> 00:14:06,851
Right after that,
she went missing.

00:14:06,918 --> 00:14:08,620
Where was she found?

00:14:08,686 --> 00:14:10,922
In the desert.

00:14:10,989 --> 00:14:13,358
Just out in the middle
of nowhere?

00:14:13,424 --> 00:14:17,395
Off Highway 55, near Sparks.

00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,736
I have to go.

00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:33,278
Betz Pharmaceutical.
Can you hold, please?

00:14:33,344 --> 00:14:34,879
Betz Pharmaceutical.
Can you hold, please?

00:14:34,946 --> 00:14:37,048
Thank you. Betz Pharmaceutical.
Can I help you?

00:14:37,115 --> 00:14:38,883
He's on the line right now.

00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:41,686
May I take a message?
And your phone number?

00:14:41,753 --> 00:14:44,489
Here are the files on Zoe
Kessler that you asked for

00:14:44,556 --> 00:14:46,624
in the warrant
along with a list

00:14:46,691 --> 00:14:48,459
of everyone the was here
on November 12th.

00:14:48,526 --> 00:14:49,794
Including the employees?

00:14:49,861 --> 00:14:52,363
Yeah. The nighttime staff's
pretty minimal.

00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:53,731
I was supervising that night.

00:14:53,798 --> 00:14:54,999
What brought Zoe in?

00:14:55,066 --> 00:14:56,067
Chronic insomnia.

00:14:56,134 --> 00:14:57,769
She came in for an overnight
sleep study

00:14:57,835 --> 00:14:58,903
but left early.

00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,405
Was there a problem?

00:15:00,471 --> 00:15:03,374
No. Some people just get
freaked out spending a night

00:15:03,441 --> 00:15:04,375
in a strange place.

00:15:04,442 --> 00:15:05,710
Happens all the time.

00:15:05,777 --> 00:15:07,745
We'll need to see
those testing rooms.

00:15:10,815 --> 00:15:12,517
As you can see, we try

00:15:12,584 --> 00:15:14,485
to make the facility as normal
as possible.

00:15:14,552 --> 00:15:16,888
Put a TV in there,
it wouldn't be half bad.

00:15:16,955 --> 00:15:18,489
But that would defeat
the purpose.

00:15:18,556 --> 00:15:20,892
We can't have anything
in there that would reveal

00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,260
the actual time.

00:15:22,327 --> 00:15:24,896
How do you monitor
your patients?

00:15:24,963 --> 00:15:28,766
Our monitoring process
is twofold.

00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:30,935
Electrodes measure EKG
and REM sleep,

00:15:31,002 --> 00:15:32,270
and we have a vid cam
in the room

00:15:32,337 --> 00:15:34,639
to help insure the
patients actually
stay in bed.

00:15:34,706 --> 00:15:37,342
You worried
about hanky-panky?

00:15:37,408 --> 00:15:38,409
Sleepwalking.

00:15:38,476 --> 00:15:40,345
After the meds
are distributed,

00:15:40,411 --> 00:15:43,081
we ask that the patients
assume a sleep-ready position.

00:15:43,147 --> 00:15:44,682
Many people assume
they have insomnia

00:15:44,749 --> 00:15:46,651
simply because they
don't get in bed.

00:15:46,718 --> 00:15:49,287
What is your
screening process?

00:15:49,354 --> 00:15:50,522
It's intensive.

00:15:50,588 --> 00:15:52,357
There's a written
application,

00:15:52,423 --> 00:15:54,692
a personal interview,
physical exam.

00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:57,161
We only take people
in the normal range.

00:15:57,228 --> 00:15:58,763
You'd be surprised
how many people just want

00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:02,100
a pharmaceutical lullaby
these days.

00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:03,635
No, I wouldn't.

00:16:05,803 --> 00:16:08,173
SANDERS:
<i>This clinic is like</i>
<i>Hotel California:</i>

00:16:08,239 --> 00:16:10,308
You can check in
any time you like,

00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:11,876
but you might
never leave.

00:16:11,943 --> 00:16:13,545
Zoe Kessler and
Captain Jack

00:16:13,611 --> 00:16:15,647
were part of the same
sleep study.

00:16:15,713 --> 00:16:17,415
How many other people
in the sleep study?

00:16:17,482 --> 00:16:18,550
A dozen.

00:16:18,616 --> 00:16:20,018
I have called
all of them
on the list.

00:16:20,084 --> 00:16:22,420
They're intact,
and none of them
are numbered.

00:16:22,487 --> 00:16:25,523
Zoe's car was found
at an impound lot downtown.

00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:28,426
It was towed from Betz's
parking lot on November 15th.

00:16:28,493 --> 00:16:30,528
Wolfowitz said Zoe
left in the middle

00:16:30,595 --> 00:16:32,230
of the night
on the 13th.

00:16:32,297 --> 00:16:33,231
With Captain Jack?

00:16:33,298 --> 00:16:34,299
I don't know,

00:16:34,365 --> 00:16:35,800
but according
to their records,

00:16:35,867 --> 00:16:37,035
he also left early.

00:16:37,101 --> 00:16:38,937
"Left early" seems
to be a euphemism.

00:16:39,003 --> 00:16:41,573
I got the results for the sinew
in the girl's teeth,

00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:44,776
and in this case,
the hand that feeds...

00:16:44,843 --> 00:16:46,211
was her own.

00:16:46,277 --> 00:16:47,745
She chewed off
her own hand?

00:16:47,812 --> 00:16:50,148
Yeah. Now, I don't know about
you, but I would rather die

00:16:50,215 --> 00:16:52,150
of starvation
than to eat my own hand.

00:16:52,217 --> 00:16:53,918
Animals in traps
do it all the time.

00:16:53,985 --> 00:16:55,453
You think she was trapped?

00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,021
Like a rat.

00:17:00,558 --> 00:17:03,862
A hand in the desert
is worth two in the bush.

00:17:03,928 --> 00:17:06,865
Right now, the hand's
all we have to go on.

00:17:06,931 --> 00:17:08,733
Okay, Grissom.

00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,968
Come on.
What are we doing here?

00:17:10,034 --> 00:17:11,336
What are the odds
that this hand is

00:17:11,402 --> 00:17:12,837
not being eaten
right now by a coyote?

00:17:12,904 --> 00:17:14,272
Hey, look, the condition
she was in,

00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:15,840
she couldn't have gotten
very far.

00:17:15,907 --> 00:17:16,841
Maybe if we find
the hand,

00:17:16,908 --> 00:17:19,511
we find
the torture chamber.

00:17:19,577 --> 00:17:20,612
Torture chamber?

00:17:20,678 --> 00:17:22,614
All right, everybody
gather around.

00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,816
Let me have your attention.

00:17:24,883 --> 00:17:27,852
We're going to proceed forward
covering the immediate area

00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,021
bordering the road
to the south,

00:17:30,088 --> 00:17:33,658
the rocks to the west and
the dry creek bed to the east.

00:18:16,134 --> 00:18:18,203
( <i>flies buzzing</i> )

00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:25,510
Oh, you smell decomp?

00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:33,785
( <i>flies buzzing</i> )

00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:42,894
You think the hand
is in that pile?

00:18:42,961 --> 00:18:44,896
Maybe.

00:18:44,963 --> 00:18:46,030
Let's get a sample.

00:18:49,934 --> 00:18:51,536
Whoo!

00:18:51,603 --> 00:18:52,704
( <i>sniffs</i> )

00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:55,173
Whew!

00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,909
The smell's coming from
these plants.

00:19:00,445 --> 00:19:02,747
" <i>Amorphophallus Titanum,</i>

00:19:02,814 --> 00:19:05,583
Corpse Flower."

00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:07,519
Now who's going to have a plant

00:19:07,585 --> 00:19:09,254
that smells
like decomposing flesh?

00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,823
Somebody who's trying
to cover up the real deal.

00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:14,459
LVPD!

00:19:16,294 --> 00:19:18,229
You smell a warrant?

00:19:18,296 --> 00:19:20,932
We can look,
but not touch.

00:19:20,999 --> 00:19:22,567
I'm in if you're in.

00:19:22,634 --> 00:19:25,803
All right,
here's the real catch-22.

00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:27,672
If we open it up,
find something probative,

00:19:27,739 --> 00:19:28,773
we can't use it.

00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,075
But we can't find something
probative...

00:19:31,142 --> 00:19:32,911
...unless we got the warrant
to open it.

00:19:32,977 --> 00:19:34,145
Yeah.

00:19:34,212 --> 00:19:35,547
That's funny,
you don't strike me

00:19:35,613 --> 00:19:37,282
as the delayed gratification
type.

00:19:37,348 --> 00:19:39,517
I'm not.
Grissom is.

00:19:39,584 --> 00:19:41,286
Right.

00:19:48,193 --> 00:19:50,795
There are some freaky-looking
plants in here.

00:19:50,862 --> 00:19:54,465
Yeah, it's all about
genetic modification.

00:19:54,532 --> 00:19:57,502
Well, if this is where they
genetically modify the plants,

00:19:57,569 --> 00:20:00,371
there's got to be a house
around here somewhere.

00:20:23,528 --> 00:20:25,997
"Jacob Wolfowitz."

00:20:26,064 --> 00:20:27,966
Isn't that the same guy
from the Betz Clinic?

00:20:28,032 --> 00:20:29,300
Yeah.

00:20:29,367 --> 00:20:31,536
( <i>clanging</i> )

00:20:32,604 --> 00:20:35,173
Mr. Wolfowitz?

00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,875
Mr. Wolfowitz,
come out of there now.

00:20:36,941 --> 00:20:38,009
We're from
the crime lab.

00:20:38,076 --> 00:20:39,210
We need to speak
with you.

00:20:39,277 --> 00:20:41,045
We can hear you, sir.

00:20:41,112 --> 00:20:42,247
Just open the door.

00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:50,388
He's not home.

00:20:57,461 --> 00:20:59,963
Are you and Mr. Wolfowitz
acquainted?

00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:01,131
No.

00:21:01,198 --> 00:21:03,066
Why were you
at his house?

00:21:03,133 --> 00:21:04,768
Breaking and entering.

00:21:07,704 --> 00:21:11,508
Is that why we found
this etching in your handbag?

00:21:11,575 --> 00:21:12,809
You were stealing it?

00:21:12,876 --> 00:21:14,211
Yes.

00:21:14,277 --> 00:21:16,546
Why?

00:21:16,613 --> 00:21:18,181
Multiple reasons.

00:21:18,248 --> 00:21:19,483
Which are?

00:21:19,549 --> 00:21:22,385
You told me Zoe
was having tests
done at Betz.

00:21:22,452 --> 00:21:27,157
I found out
who oversaw the tests--
Mr. Wolfowitz.

00:21:27,224 --> 00:21:29,860
He lives close
to where you found Zoe.

00:21:29,926 --> 00:21:32,129
If I'm caught stealing,

00:21:32,195 --> 00:21:35,165
he may want the police
to investigate.

00:21:37,834 --> 00:21:39,836
BRASS:
We know the woman
who broke into your house,

00:21:39,903 --> 00:21:41,838
and you don't want
to press charges?

00:21:41,905 --> 00:21:44,274
She's clearly disturbed.

00:21:44,341 --> 00:21:46,676
She just lost her daughter,

00:21:46,743 --> 00:21:48,745
and I was one
of the last people

00:21:48,812 --> 00:21:50,447
to see Zoe Kessler alive.

00:21:50,514 --> 00:21:55,719
I'm sure she was
just looking for
a connection.

00:21:55,786 --> 00:21:57,320
You don't want us
to look around,

00:21:57,387 --> 00:21:58,722

was stolen?

00:21:58,789 --> 00:22:00,490
I live pretty simply.

00:22:00,557 --> 00:22:02,893
I don't have anything
worth taking.

00:22:02,959 --> 00:22:05,896
But I appreciate
your concern.

00:22:05,962 --> 00:22:10,066
However, if he refuses
to press charges...

00:22:10,133 --> 00:22:13,437
I'd have to ask myself what
kind of person would do that.

00:22:13,503 --> 00:22:15,539
Someone with something to hide.

00:22:15,605 --> 00:22:17,474
Precisely.

Why, uh, steal this?

00:22:23,113 --> 00:22:25,015

illustrations

00:22:25,081 --> 00:22:26,817
of the Romulus and Remus myth.

00:22:26,883 --> 00:22:28,752
It's printed from a plate.

00:22:28,819 --> 00:22:30,086
Must be worth thousands.

00:22:30,153 --> 00:22:32,389
So?

00:22:32,456 --> 00:22:34,858
Well, it looks like
a page from a book.

00:22:34,925 --> 00:22:37,694
I find that people
who don't respect books

00:22:37,761 --> 00:22:40,630
have a general disregard
for keeping things whole.

00:22:40,697 --> 00:22:42,899
So you think he stole it?

00:22:42,966 --> 00:22:45,402
I think a pencil pusher
in a pharmaceutical lab

00:22:45,469 --> 00:22:47,070
couldn't afford it.

00:22:49,673 --> 00:22:51,575

00:22:51,641 --> 00:22:54,177
18 years. Oh.

00:22:54,244 --> 00:22:55,712
But that's a long way
from your home

00:22:55,779 --> 00:22:57,047

isn't it?

00:22:57,114 --> 00:23:01,952

and, uh, space for my plants.

Even if all this is true,

we still don't know
if he killed your daughter.

00:23:13,497 --> 00:23:15,465
Too many coincidences.

00:23:15,532 --> 00:23:18,935
You have to stay away from him.

00:23:19,002 --> 00:23:25,275
You forfeited the right to give
me advice some time ago.

00:23:25,342 --> 00:23:27,344
But thank you.

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,869
Ah, I believe this is authentic.

00:23:52,936 --> 00:23:55,305
Iron-gall ink
from the 16th century

00:23:55,372 --> 00:23:57,307
tends to turn a brownish color.

00:23:57,374 --> 00:23:59,309
Especially when it's
been sitting around

00:23:59,376 --> 00:24:01,044
for a few centuries.

00:24:04,448 --> 00:24:07,851
See how the ink bites
into the parchment of the page.

00:24:07,918 --> 00:24:10,187
Is that an acidic compound?

00:24:10,253 --> 00:24:13,023
Gall inks are often made
with wine or vinegar.

to the manuscript illuminator.

00:24:16,726 --> 00:24:20,464

The edge appears
fairly pristine.

00:24:26,136 --> 00:24:29,172
How could he remove it
from the book so cleanly?

00:24:29,239 --> 00:24:33,176
My guess?
Classic spit and string.

00:24:51,261 --> 00:24:54,264

for DNA,

00:32:59,452 --> 00:33:01,054
I would've.

00:33:01,121 --> 00:33:03,957
I mean, I wouldn't have
slept with him first, but...

00:33:04,024 --> 00:33:05,525
Same DNA, different prints.

00:33:05,592 --> 00:33:08,228
So all the DNA that we
attributed to Wolfowitz,

00:33:08,294 --> 00:33:09,629
could be Sneller's.

00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:11,798
Which makes you wonder
who's on the autopsy table.

00:33:12,999 --> 00:33:15,568
Sneller joined the army in 1985.

00:33:15,635 --> 00:33:18,171
He was stationed at
a field hospital near Berlin

00:33:18,238 --> 00:33:19,472
until about a year ago.

00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:20,807
( <i>knocking</i> )

00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:26,279
<i>At which point, I think</i>
<i>that he came to Vegas,</i>

00:33:26,346 --> 00:33:29,816
<i>put his brother on ice,</i>

00:33:29,883 --> 00:33:31,151
<i>started impersonating him.</i>

00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:32,185
Good morning,
Mr. Wolfowitz.

00:33:32,252 --> 00:33:33,420
Good morning.

00:33:33,486 --> 00:33:35,689
I mean, I know this theory's
a little out there,

00:33:35,755 --> 00:33:36,890
but given the evidence...

00:33:36,956 --> 00:33:39,292
it's the only conclusion
that makes any sense.

00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:41,761
Occam's razor,
principle of parsimony.

00:33:41,828 --> 00:33:43,997
If you hear hoofbeats,
think horses, not zebras.

00:33:44,064 --> 00:33:46,266
Given twins...

00:33:46,333 --> 00:33:47,834
go with twins.

00:33:55,842 --> 00:33:57,877
Everything is code four.

00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:10,957
Well, this isn't
a torture chamber,

00:34:11,024 --> 00:34:12,892
it's a time capsule.

00:34:12,959 --> 00:34:15,762
Wolfowitz inherited this
place from his parents.

00:34:15,829 --> 00:34:18,865
Took over the deed
about ten years ago.

00:34:18,932 --> 00:34:21,234
Love what he's done
with the place.

00:34:25,405 --> 00:34:27,273
I found a blue pill in the car.

00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:31,277
Tox came back, didn't match
any known pharmaceutical.

00:34:31,344 --> 00:34:33,780
Sampling the company candy.

00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:45,058
( <i>creaks</i> )

00:34:46,092 --> 00:34:47,560
( <i>creaks</i> )

00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:52,032
Shabbat shalom.

00:34:52,098 --> 00:34:53,500
Jewish?

00:34:56,069 --> 00:34:58,171
( <i>creaking</i> )

00:35:06,212 --> 00:35:07,781
Well.

00:35:15,755 --> 00:35:17,957
( <i>creaks</i> )

00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:18,218
GRISSOM:
It appears he was meticulously
documenting experiments.

00:36:18,284 --> 00:36:22,822
This one looks like it
deals with craniometry.

00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:25,258
I think he was
measuring skulls

00:36:25,325 --> 00:36:27,093
to determine intelligence.

00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,929
I think this is
a gynecological device

00:36:29,996 --> 00:36:31,431
from a hundred years ago.

00:36:32,832 --> 00:36:37,771
<i>"Arbeit macht frei."</i>

00:36:37,837 --> 00:36:39,839
Work will set you free.

00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:43,376
These words hung over
the gates at Auschwitz.

00:36:43,443 --> 00:36:47,681
Zoe Kessler would've made
the perfect uberwoman

00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:49,683
except for her one brown eye.

00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:51,284
So I guess, uh,

00:36:51,351 --> 00:36:53,353
what nature couldn't fix,

00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:56,790
our Dr. Mengele could,
is that it?

00:36:56,856 --> 00:36:59,526
Hey, check out the face
of the clock.

00:37:02,829 --> 00:37:04,764
GRISSOM:
No numbers.

00:37:04,831 --> 00:37:07,334
( <i>groaning</i> )

00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:10,570
( <i>groaning</i> )

00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:18,211
( <i>groaning</i> )

00:37:18,278 --> 00:37:20,113
( <i>creaks</i> )

00:37:44,437 --> 00:37:46,840
I'll call a paramedic.

00:37:52,312 --> 00:37:54,114
This one's dead.

00:38:01,221 --> 00:38:03,189
Massive blood loss
was the cause of death.

00:38:03,256 --> 00:38:05,225
Hey, Catherine.

00:38:05,291 --> 00:38:07,093
So Brass has put the
lockdown on the airport,

00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,795
bus depot
and train station.

00:38:08,862 --> 00:38:10,563
But so far, no Sneller.

00:38:11,898 --> 00:38:13,366
Well, the other twin
didn't make it.

00:38:13,433 --> 00:38:15,368
Well, speaking of twins,

00:38:15,435 --> 00:38:16,603
we got a call from
Social Services.

00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:18,571
Sneller was
their birth name.

00:38:18,638 --> 00:38:19,939
But they were adopted

00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:21,775
by a Jewish couple
named Wolfowitz.

00:38:23,243 --> 00:38:26,079
That explains the Judaica.

00:38:26,146 --> 00:38:29,916
I guess Jacob went nurture
and Leon went nature.

00:38:29,983 --> 00:38:32,352
Maybe he went Nazi,

00:38:32,419 --> 00:38:35,221
trying to kill the Jewish
half of himself.

00:38:49,202 --> 00:38:52,605
<i>"Those who want to live,</i>
<i>let them fight,</i>

00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:54,240
<i>"and those who do not</i>
<i>want to fight</i>

( <i>indistinct police radio</i>

00:40:38,745 --> 00:40:40,981
Have you guys secured
the entire perimeter?

00:40:41,047 --> 00:40:42,015
The house and the barn?

00:40:42,082 --> 00:40:44,117
Yes, sir.
All clear.

00:41:35,335 --> 00:41:36,369
( <i>groans loudly</i> )

00:41:36,436 --> 00:41:37,804
( <i>groans</i> )

00:41:42,942 --> 00:41:44,144
Heather!

00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,578
Stop it!

00:41:45,645 --> 00:41:46,946
No.

00:41:47,013 --> 00:41:48,748
Let me finish.

00:41:52,419 --> 00:41:53,586
You cannot do this!

00:41:53,653 --> 00:41:55,588
No! Let go!

00:41:55,655 --> 00:41:56,956
Let...!

00:41:57,023 --> 00:41:58,458
No!
Please...

00:41:58,525 --> 00:42:00,493
( <i>cries</i> )

00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,028
Stop.

00:42:03,997 --> 00:42:05,332
Heather.

Please...

00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,503
I'm saying stop.
