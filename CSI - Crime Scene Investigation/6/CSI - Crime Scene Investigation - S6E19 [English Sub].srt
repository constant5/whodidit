00:00:08,333 --> 00:00:11,203
( <i>people laughing and talking)</i>

00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,164
WOMAN:
Focus all your intention
on the crystal

00:00:39,231 --> 00:00:41,900
for your highest truth.

00:00:45,437 --> 00:00:48,306
What is your first question?

00:00:48,373 --> 00:00:50,575
YOUNG WOMAN:
I want to know
if he loves me.

00:00:54,312 --> 00:00:56,448
I see red.

00:00:56,515 --> 00:00:59,518
That can be passion.

00:00:59,584 --> 00:01:02,487
The connection between you
is very strong.

00:01:09,628 --> 00:01:11,763
I see blood.

00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:13,865
There's danger around you.

00:01:13,932 --> 00:01:16,268
Well, my parents do hate him.

00:01:16,334 --> 00:01:18,804
I'm getting a name Ray. Ray.

00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,505
and a letter "B."

00:01:20,572 --> 00:01:23,642
Uh, when, when we put the name
Ray with the letter "B,"

00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,177
does anything come up for you?

00:01:26,444 --> 00:01:28,847
We don't know
anyone named Ray.

00:01:28,914 --> 00:01:31,116
And my boyfriend's name
is Stuart.

00:01:31,183 --> 00:01:33,985
There's something
else-- "R."

00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:37,689
Ro-ro... rode,
rode, rodeo.

00:01:37,756 --> 00:01:39,724
Is he connected to a rodeo?

00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:41,693
Is he taking you
to a rodeo?

00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,962
I don't think so.

00:01:44,029 --> 00:01:46,364
I'm getting another image.

00:01:46,431 --> 00:01:49,000
Um... an arm.

00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:52,671
It's a one-armed cactus,
but it's not in the ground.

00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:55,340
And then it's cold.

00:01:55,407 --> 00:02:00,412
I don't usually tell people
when I see bad things

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,349
but the danger
is so strong
I can feel it.

00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,351
Okay, this is stupid.
You're scaring us.

00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:08,553
Don't go.

00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:09,254
Come on.

00:02:09,321 --> 00:02:11,122
Don't!

00:02:14,893 --> 00:02:16,061
( <i>tires screech</i> )

00:02:16,128 --> 00:02:17,429
Jerk!

00:02:24,503 --> 00:02:26,271
( <i>indistinct radio call</i> )

00:02:29,841 --> 00:02:30,909
Say hello

00:02:30,976 --> 00:02:32,344
to Anna Leah
and Lori.

00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:34,012
You may remember them.

00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:35,247
A few years ago
they stole a car

00:02:35,313 --> 00:02:36,248
and found
a severed head

00:02:36,314 --> 00:02:37,282
in the trunk.

00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:39,050
How could I forget that?

00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,352
Well, now they found

00:02:40,418 --> 00:02:41,520
a dead psychic,

00:02:41,586 --> 00:02:43,221
Sedona Wiley,
in the occult shop.

00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,223
She said there was
danger all around us.

00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,691
I mean, we almost got hit
by a car

00:02:46,758 --> 00:02:48,326
right here,
and then she's dead.

00:02:48,393 --> 00:02:49,728
Wait, I'm confused.

00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:52,297
You left and then you came back?

00:02:52,364 --> 00:02:54,399
Yeah. I forgot
my sunglasses.

00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:56,701
200 bucks.

00:02:56,768 --> 00:02:58,069
This officer will take
you downtown

00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,671
to take
your statement, okay?

00:03:07,345 --> 00:03:08,914
Greg?

00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,749
Hey.

00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:12,851
I thought I paged Warrick
on this.

00:03:12,918 --> 00:03:13,885
Yeah, about that,

00:03:13,952 --> 00:03:16,321
uh, we traded days.

00:03:16,388 --> 00:03:18,390
Because?

00:03:18,456 --> 00:03:21,927
Well, uh, it's a long story,
but the short answer is

00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:25,063
I have an expertise
in the occult.

00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:26,298
Huh.

00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:29,701
Hello, David.

00:03:29,768 --> 00:03:30,735
What do you know?

00:03:30,802 --> 00:03:32,471
Gunshot to the chest.

00:03:32,537 --> 00:03:35,340
Liver temp is 98 degrees
which is odd

00:03:35,407 --> 00:03:36,708
unless she's running
a fever.

00:03:36,775 --> 00:03:38,910
It means I can't
give you an accurate TOD.

00:03:38,977 --> 00:03:41,012
Sorry.

00:03:43,081 --> 00:03:44,516
Bullet was a through-
and-through.

00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:47,285
Based on lividity,
the body wasn't moved.

00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:49,321
What's in the back room?

00:03:49,387 --> 00:03:51,957
A small office.

00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:54,292
Probably where she did
the readings.

00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:58,130
There's, uh, incense, pendulum,
jar of marbles.

00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:00,132
They're used
for divining.

00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:02,000
It's hipper
than the old crystal ball.

00:04:02,067 --> 00:04:04,669
Where did you say your expertise
comes from?

00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,037
Oh, my grandmother, Nana Olaf.

00:04:06,104 --> 00:04:07,539
She was a psychic.

00:04:07,606 --> 00:04:08,640
She didn't have a store.

00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:10,642
She just had
a kitchen table

00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:12,777
and she prognosticated
for free.

00:04:12,844 --> 00:04:14,746
She had a sixth sense.

00:04:14,813 --> 00:04:17,449
And the family thinks that
I might have inherited it.

00:04:17,516 --> 00:04:19,284
Okay.

00:04:19,351 --> 00:04:20,952
What am I thinking?

00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:23,455
That I'm due for a promotion?

00:04:23,522 --> 00:04:27,559
I'm thinking you should focus
on your other five senses.

Got some blood drops over here.

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,769
Connected to the blood pool?

00:05:14,709 --> 00:05:15,951
No.

00:05:16,786 --> 00:05:19,455
Maybe the killer
cut himself?

00:05:23,826 --> 00:05:25,061
I'll swab it.

00:05:28,364 --> 00:05:30,866
Gil, you ever been
to a psychic?

00:05:30,933 --> 00:05:33,869
Would it surprise you if I had?

00:05:33,936 --> 00:05:35,237
Yeah.

00:05:35,304 --> 00:05:38,607
Surprise. So go ahead
and run it for me.

00:05:38,674 --> 00:05:42,111
Sure.
Uh, cash register's empty,

00:05:42,178 --> 00:05:43,646
which could mean

00:05:43,713 --> 00:05:45,548
robbery gone bad.

00:05:45,614 --> 00:05:47,950
The shot
was a through-and-through.

00:05:48,017 --> 00:05:48,985
Bullet went into this wall.

00:05:49,051 --> 00:05:50,453
Haven't extracted
it yet.

00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:52,655
Shot was fired along this line.

00:05:58,861 --> 00:06:01,597
Which puts the shooter
on the far side of the body.

00:06:03,566 --> 00:06:06,035
Well, if it was a robbery,
why'd they trash the place?

00:06:06,102 --> 00:06:08,504
Well, I can think
of two reasons:

00:06:08,571 --> 00:06:11,641
One, the shooter was on drugs
and did it just to do it.

00:06:11,707 --> 00:06:14,543
or there wasn't enough money
in the register

00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:16,846
and he decided to look for more.

00:06:16,912 --> 00:06:18,848
Go on.

00:06:18,914 --> 00:06:21,283
Well, uh,

00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:24,120
he figured that the victim
must have had a purse

00:06:24,186 --> 00:06:28,224
or a safe somewhere...

00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:30,660
and terrorizing her
is one way

00:06:30,726 --> 00:06:32,161
to get her
to give it up.

00:06:49,578 --> 00:06:51,213
They didn't take her purse.

00:07:00,056 --> 00:07:02,358
( <i>fast forwards tape</i> )

00:07:03,893 --> 00:07:06,729
WILEY:
I'm getting a name: Ray. Ray.

00:07:06,796 --> 00:07:08,631
and a letter "B."

00:07:08,698 --> 00:07:11,567
Um, when, when we put the name
Ray with the letter "B,"

00:07:11,634 --> 00:07:13,202
does anything come up for you?

00:07:13,269 --> 00:07:15,738
GIRL:
We don't know anyone named Ray,

00:07:15,805 --> 00:07:17,606
and my boyfriend's name
is Stuart.

00:07:17,673 --> 00:07:20,309
Ray Bans-- "Ray B."

00:07:20,376 --> 00:07:21,978
WILEY:
There's something else.

00:07:22,044 --> 00:07:25,581
"R," ro, rode. Rodeo.

00:07:25,648 --> 00:07:27,950
Is it connected to a rodeo?

00:07:28,017 --> 00:07:30,052
Is he taking you to a rodeo?

00:07:30,119 --> 00:07:31,587
GIRL:
I don't think so.

00:07:31,654 --> 00:07:36,359
I'm gettin another image,
an arm.

00:07:36,425 --> 00:07:39,261
A one-armed cactus,
but it's not in the ground.

00:07:39,328 --> 00:07:40,363
And then it...

00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:48,104
I usually tell people when I see
bad things, but the danger...

00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,405
Grissom?

00:07:49,472 --> 00:07:51,907
...is so strong...

00:07:51,974 --> 00:07:53,242
Take a look out there.

00:07:53,309 --> 00:07:54,610
What do you see?

00:07:54,677 --> 00:07:56,345
A one-armed cactus.

00:07:56,412 --> 00:07:58,280
And take a look
at these labels.

00:07:58,347 --> 00:07:59,882
"Rhode... eo."

00:07:59,949 --> 00:08:02,184
They spell rodeo.

00:08:02,251 --> 00:08:04,453
Power of suggestion, Greg.

00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,089
I think that
the victim saw

00:08:07,156 --> 00:08:08,457
images of the
crime scene.

00:08:08,524 --> 00:08:11,727
Grissom, I think she foresaw
her own death.

00:08:19,568 --> 00:08:23,105
Before you ask,
no, I did not find
her third eye.

00:08:23,172 --> 00:08:25,074
What did you find?

00:08:25,141 --> 00:08:27,610
Center-mass shot
front to back.

00:08:27,677 --> 00:08:28,644
Large caliber bullet.

00:08:28,711 --> 00:08:31,047
Clipped her aorta.

00:08:31,113 --> 00:08:33,582
C.O.D. was exsanguination.
She bled out.

00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:35,551
David said
she was running hot.

00:08:35,618 --> 00:08:37,019
There's no signs
of infection

00:08:37,086 --> 00:08:40,389
but I did find trace amounts
of a white powder

00:08:40,456 --> 00:08:42,325
in her nasal cavities
and lungs.

00:08:42,391 --> 00:08:45,628
Possibly cocaine-induced
hyperthermia.

00:08:45,695 --> 00:08:47,163
I ordered
a full drug panel

00:08:47,229 --> 00:08:48,397
and sent a sample
to Hodges.

00:08:48,464 --> 00:08:50,633
It could be a hallucinogen.

00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:54,303
In some native cultures,
shamans use peyote

00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:56,105
to call forth visions.

00:08:56,172 --> 00:09:01,010
Al, when someone sells love
potions and magic spells,

00:09:01,077 --> 00:09:04,113
the only visions they see
are dollar signs.

00:09:46,589 --> 00:09:48,991
Five right 44, consistent
with a Smith &amp; Wesson,

00:09:49,058 --> 00:09:50,393
but no hits in IBIS.

00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:52,928
Whew, somebody used
some heavy artillery
on that psychic.

00:09:52,995 --> 00:09:55,698
And remind me again
why you didn't show
up at the crime scene?

00:09:55,765 --> 00:09:58,200
'Cause your former
lab boy begged me for it.

00:09:58,267 --> 00:10:00,069
He offered to take
my next holiday on-call.

00:10:00,136 --> 00:10:03,105
I thought he was nuts,
but I wasn't going
to pass him up.

00:10:03,172 --> 00:10:04,440
To be honest
with you, Grissom,

00:10:04,507 --> 00:10:06,309
my wife's having a hard time
with my schedule.

00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:07,877
She's spending a lot
of time alone.

00:10:07,943 --> 00:10:10,212
I didn't think it would
be that big of a deal.

00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:12,081
Well, you should
have cleared it with me.

00:10:12,148 --> 00:10:14,950
And by the way,
you're still on the case.
All right.

00:10:15,818 --> 00:10:17,086
I paged Greg.

00:10:17,153 --> 00:10:18,821
I don't know where he is.

00:10:18,888 --> 00:10:21,324
That's okay, 'cause Warrick
is now backing him up.

00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,025
What do you got?

00:10:23,092 --> 00:10:25,094
There's too many prints
and there's too many hits.

00:10:25,161 --> 00:10:26,662
I need some help.

00:10:26,729 --> 00:10:27,663
Can you talk

00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:29,765
to Ecklie,
please?

00:10:29,832 --> 00:10:30,800
I'll do what I can.

00:10:30,866 --> 00:10:31,834
What about the cash register?

00:10:31,901 --> 00:10:33,736
I ran those per Greg...

00:10:33,803 --> 00:10:36,005
per you.

00:10:36,072 --> 00:10:38,040
All the prints belonged
to the victim except for two.

00:10:38,107 --> 00:10:40,009
Both of which were
a match to a Reese Bingham.

00:10:40,076 --> 00:10:41,711
His work card's
in the system.

00:10:41,777 --> 00:10:43,579
Okay, I'm on it.

00:10:43,646 --> 00:10:45,748
The State has a law that murder

00:10:45,815 --> 00:10:47,450
committed during the commission
of a felony

00:10:47,516 --> 00:10:49,919
buys you the death penalty.
Do you understand that?

00:10:49,986 --> 00:10:51,387
This has to be a mistake.

00:10:51,454 --> 00:10:52,855
I don't even eat meat.

00:10:52,922 --> 00:10:54,390
Or cheese.

00:10:54,457 --> 00:10:56,359
I won't even hire
an exterminator.

00:10:56,425 --> 00:10:58,527
Your prints were found
at the crime scene.

00:10:58,594 --> 00:11:01,430
I haven't been
to any crime scenes.

00:11:01,497 --> 00:11:03,466
You been to any occult shops
lately?

00:11:03,532 --> 00:11:05,968
Yeah, I work
next door to one.

00:11:06,035 --> 00:11:08,070
You want to explain to me
why your prints were found

00:11:08,137 --> 00:11:09,071
on the cash register?

00:11:09,138 --> 00:11:11,040
The owner's my friend.

00:11:11,107 --> 00:11:12,875
Did something
happen to her?

00:11:12,942 --> 00:11:14,577
You don't know
that she's dead?

00:11:14,644 --> 00:11:16,479
No.

00:11:16,545 --> 00:11:18,914
She was
killed

00:11:18,981 --> 00:11:20,783
and then robbed, and your prints

00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:22,118
are on her
cash register.

00:11:22,184 --> 00:11:23,252
Okay, yeah, wait...

00:11:23,319 --> 00:11:24,820
I can
explain that.

00:11:24,887 --> 00:11:26,088
Start explaining.

00:11:26,155 --> 00:11:27,923
I work at a vegetarian
restaurant.

00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:30,259
We make these soy burgers.

00:11:30,326 --> 00:11:32,395
Sedona was
hooked on them.

00:11:32,461 --> 00:11:34,930
So, you know,
she'd order,
I'd deliver.

00:11:34,997 --> 00:11:37,833
So you're a soy-burger-making,
vegetarian delivery boy, hmm?

00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:41,170
Look, she's always busy

00:11:41,237 --> 00:11:44,440
doing a reading
or whipping up
some kind of potion.

00:11:44,507 --> 00:11:47,610
She told me to take
the money out of the drawer.

00:11:47,677 --> 00:11:49,078
Give yourself a tip?

00:11:49,145 --> 00:11:51,781
Soy burger and fried
was $6.95 plus tax.

00:11:51,847 --> 00:11:53,082
I'd take a ten.

00:11:53,149 --> 00:11:54,617
You delivered
to her last night?

00:11:54,684 --> 00:11:56,585
No.

00:11:56,652 --> 00:11:57,920
Was it your day off?

00:11:57,987 --> 00:12:00,656
Like most nights,
I work until 6:00

00:12:00,723 --> 00:12:04,794
and then I like... to go
to the Stripperama.

00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,429
I thought you didn't like meat?

00:12:06,495 --> 00:12:08,097
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:12:08,164 --> 00:12:09,999
Is there anyone
who can confirm that?

00:12:10,066 --> 00:12:11,934
Well, yeah.

00:12:12,001 --> 00:12:13,836
She got a name?

00:12:13,903 --> 00:12:16,672
Girls aren't allowed
to tell you their real names,

00:12:16,739 --> 00:12:19,508
but I call her Star
'cause she has these...

00:12:19,575 --> 00:12:21,711
blue stars tattooed
on her hips.

00:12:21,777 --> 00:12:25,481
And it kind of looks
like a meteor shower
when she dances.

00:12:25,548 --> 00:12:27,149
Would you stand up, please.

00:12:27,216 --> 00:12:30,152
I can go?

00:12:30,219 --> 00:12:31,253
No.

00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,955
You can strip down
to your skivvies.

00:12:33,022 --> 00:12:34,323
Excuse me?

00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:35,725
You want some music?

00:12:41,897 --> 00:12:43,899
Hey, Jim.

00:12:43,966 --> 00:12:45,534
Packey. What are
you doing here?

00:12:45,601 --> 00:12:46,702
Aren't you retired?

00:12:46,769 --> 00:12:48,504
I'm here on business.

00:12:48,571 --> 00:12:51,440
Business? I thought
your only business
was playing golf.

00:12:51,507 --> 00:12:55,011
Any leads on
your dead psychic?

00:12:55,077 --> 00:12:56,779
Why? What's the interest?

00:12:56,846 --> 00:12:58,147
You looking to make a bet?

00:12:58,214 --> 00:13:00,216
I knew the victim.

00:13:00,282 --> 00:13:03,152
A few weeks ago I went to see
her about the Wallace case.

00:13:03,219 --> 00:13:05,221
So you're still hunting
the white whale, huh?

00:13:05,287 --> 00:13:09,025
15 years, no arrests.

00:13:09,091 --> 00:13:12,995
Still burns me he used
to be one of us.

00:13:13,062 --> 00:13:15,564
I really wanted to catch Wallace
before I retired.

00:13:15,631 --> 00:13:19,435
So you talked to a psychic.

00:13:19,502 --> 00:13:23,406
Jim, she told me things
that she couldn't possibly know

00:13:23,472 --> 00:13:24,440
about this case.

00:13:24,507 --> 00:13:25,841
She also told me
that Claire Wallace

00:13:25,908 --> 00:13:27,376
was murdered by her husband

00:13:27,443 --> 00:13:29,178
and he buried the body
in Summerlin.

00:13:29,245 --> 00:13:31,947
Too bad she didn't
give you an address.

00:13:32,014 --> 00:13:33,516
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:13:33,582 --> 00:13:34,650
Forget it.

00:13:34,717 --> 00:13:36,018
No, hey, come on, Packey.

00:13:36,085 --> 00:13:37,687
Come on, come on. Sit down.

00:13:37,753 --> 00:13:39,989
Sit down.

00:13:40,056 --> 00:13:43,726
Look, Jim, I interrogated
him at least a dozen times.

00:13:43,793 --> 00:13:45,861
And I never got a rise
from the smug bastard

00:13:45,928 --> 00:13:47,129
until the last time--

00:13:47,196 --> 00:13:48,898
until I repeated what
this psychic told me.

00:13:48,964 --> 00:13:51,567
So you think Wallace killed her
because...

00:13:51,634 --> 00:13:55,271
He was afraid she'd eventually
lead me to the body.

00:13:55,338 --> 00:13:58,040
I even scheduled
another reading with her, but...

00:13:58,107 --> 00:13:59,809
Did he know her?

00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:02,545
Did you tell him
her name?

00:14:02,611 --> 00:14:03,813
Of course not.

00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:06,782
Well, if he didn't know
who she was...

00:14:06,849 --> 00:14:09,685
All right, all right.

00:14:09,752 --> 00:14:11,220
At least do me the courtesy

00:14:11,287 --> 00:14:13,556
of running Gordon Wallace's
prints against any prints

00:14:13,622 --> 00:14:16,959
found at
the crime scene.

00:14:17,026 --> 00:14:20,396
Check the case file.

00:14:20,463 --> 00:14:23,632
The last interrogation tape's
still in there.

00:14:23,699 --> 00:14:26,002
You'll see.

00:14:43,185 --> 00:14:45,521
Gil, I need a favor.

00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:52,077
( <i>dance music playing</i> )

00:14:58,851 --> 00:15:00,917
MAN:
Most of my girls
have tats.

00:15:00,917 --> 00:15:02,585
He said they were
shaped like stars.

00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:03,853
What color?

00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,154
Blue.

00:15:05,221 --> 00:15:06,556
That'd be Tammy.

00:15:06,622 --> 00:15:08,491
She's at the bar.

00:15:08,558 --> 00:15:10,626
Help yourself.
Thanks.

00:15:10,693 --> 00:15:11,761
Hey.

00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:13,329
Greg, what are
you doing here?

00:15:13,396 --> 00:15:15,131
Oh, Grissom said
you're backing me up.

00:15:15,198 --> 00:15:17,066
Can't back me up
if I'm not here.

00:15:17,133 --> 00:15:19,001
The next time you
screw me up with Grissom,

00:15:19,068 --> 00:15:21,104
I'm going to back you up
right off a cliff.

00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,339
Oh, come on, Rick,
ain't no thing.

00:15:23,406 --> 00:15:24,607
We're working the case.

00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:25,775
Flash the badge,

00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:27,043
no cover charge.

00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:28,311
Get to see the ladies.

00:15:28,378 --> 00:15:30,780
Let's go.

00:15:32,749 --> 00:15:34,083
You must be Tammy.

00:15:35,151 --> 00:15:37,420
Yes.

00:15:37,487 --> 00:15:40,189
Is there a quiet place
where we could talk?

00:15:40,256 --> 00:15:41,290
You got
the dime,

00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,292
I got the time.

00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,727
Unfortunately,
the Crime Lab

00:15:44,794 --> 00:15:46,029
doesn't have
a budget for that.

00:15:46,095 --> 00:15:48,064
Greg Sanders,
Warrick Brown.

00:15:48,131 --> 00:15:49,365
Las Vegas Crime Lab.

00:15:49,432 --> 00:15:52,035
Well, we get the bottom
of the barrel around this place.

00:15:52,101 --> 00:15:53,636
Who's in trouble now?

00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,139
He is.

00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:57,206
Have you seen him?

00:15:57,273 --> 00:15:59,208
He comes in all the time.

00:15:59,275 --> 00:16:01,611
Smells like nasty pickles.

00:16:01,677 --> 00:16:04,313
Was he here last night?

00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,415
Yeah.

00:16:05,481 --> 00:16:06,716
Let's see, I go on

00:16:06,783 --> 00:16:07,917
around 7:00.

00:16:07,984 --> 00:16:09,452
He was in the front row waiting.

00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,654
Hung around
all night.

00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:14,323
Then he waited in
the parking lot to say good-bye.

00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,758
So he was stalking you?

00:16:15,825 --> 00:16:18,194
( <i>chuckles</i> ):
No, nothing like that.

00:16:18,261 --> 00:16:20,163
He's harmless.

00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,632
Like you, sweetie.

00:17:20,723 --> 00:17:22,025
WILLOWS:
Hey, Gil,
if you're swamped,

00:17:22,091 --> 00:17:25,328
I can always cancel
my vacation plans.

00:17:25,395 --> 00:17:27,130
We've got it covered.

00:17:27,196 --> 00:17:29,098
Good, 'cause I really
wasn't that serious.

00:17:29,165 --> 00:17:30,333
What are you working on?

00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,403
A favor
for Brass.

00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,171
Oh, the Wallace case.

00:17:35,238 --> 00:17:37,173
Yeah, I wanted on this
way back when.

00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,575
But I was the new kid,
and my supervisor
wouldn't let me do it.

00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:41,177
I probably would

00:17:41,244 --> 00:17:42,245
have solved it, too.

00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:43,846
Is there
a new lead?

00:17:43,913 --> 00:17:45,081
I'm not sure yet.

00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:46,482
I heard Jameson dug
30 holes

00:17:46,549 --> 00:17:48,184
in the desert looking
for her body?

00:17:48,251 --> 00:17:49,519
37 actually.

00:17:49,585 --> 00:17:50,586
That's dedication.

00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:52,889
Or obsession.

00:17:52,955 --> 00:17:56,359
You know, my sister
lived near the Wallaces
out in Henderson.

00:17:56,426 --> 00:17:57,660
Their fights
were legendary.

00:17:57,727 --> 00:17:59,228
I was at
a barbecue one time,

00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:01,564
I heard them screaming
at each other from
three blocks away.

00:18:01,631 --> 00:18:03,833
Made me and Eddie seem
like amateurs.

00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,035
Where are you and Lindsay
going this year?

00:18:06,102 --> 00:18:08,705
Disneyland. With the parents.

00:18:08,771 --> 00:18:10,707
Quality time with Dad?

00:18:10,773 --> 00:18:12,241
Oh, yeah.

00:18:12,308 --> 00:18:14,811
And Sam wanted to take us
on the Tangiers jet

00:18:14,877 --> 00:18:15,978
but my mother refused.

00:18:16,045 --> 00:18:17,013
Said it wasn't
the tradition.

00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,348
So now we're driving.

00:18:18,414 --> 00:18:20,616
Yeah, that'll be
a hell of a road trip.

00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:22,385
Have fun.
Say hi to Sam.

00:18:22,452 --> 00:18:23,753
Will do.

00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,188
Still working on
those prints

00:18:25,254 --> 00:18:26,456
from the occult shop.

00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:27,690
Thank you for talking
to Ecklie.

00:18:27,757 --> 00:18:28,758
He sent me some help.

00:18:28,825 --> 00:18:30,727
Good. I have one more for you.

00:18:33,296 --> 00:18:34,897
This is LVPD.

00:18:34,964 --> 00:18:37,166
It's not going to be
in the AFIS
Criminal database.

00:18:37,233 --> 00:18:39,168
I'm going to have to do
a manual comparison.

00:18:39,235 --> 00:18:40,470
It's going
to take longer.

00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:43,539
Is he a suspect?

00:18:43,606 --> 00:18:46,008
He's a person of interest.

00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:27,650
Hey, Henry, what's up?

00:19:27,717 --> 00:19:31,087
My job can get a little
mundane sometimes...

00:19:31,154 --> 00:19:32,655
Not today.

00:19:32,722 --> 00:19:35,258
I'll second that
and raise you a stripper.

00:19:35,324 --> 00:19:36,693
Okay, sure...

00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:38,628
Anyway, the powder on
your victim's nose and lungs

00:19:38,695 --> 00:19:39,996
is atropine.

00:19:40,063 --> 00:19:41,831
It's used to dilate pupils,
control bladder problems

00:19:41,898 --> 00:19:44,500
and it can be fatal
in large doses.

00:19:44,567 --> 00:19:46,769
Atropine comes from
a plant, right?

00:19:46,836 --> 00:19:48,438
Belladonna.
Also known as deadly nightshade.

00:19:48,504 --> 00:19:49,605
Most people don't know

00:19:49,672 --> 00:19:51,741
it grows wild throughout
the Southwest.

00:19:55,144 --> 00:19:56,879
The psychic had that
in her shop.

00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:58,481
Can you tell
from the blood work

00:19:58,548 --> 00:20:00,550
whether she absorbed enough
for it to be lethal?

00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:01,684
Levels were fairly low.

00:20:01,751 --> 00:20:02,752
No other drugs detected.

00:20:02,819 --> 00:20:04,253
So, no.

00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,723
But if she hadn't been shot,
it would have made her sick.

00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:08,658
What about hyperthermia?

00:20:08,725 --> 00:20:10,026
Definitely. Why?

00:20:10,093 --> 00:20:11,694
The vic's temperature
was elevated.

00:20:11,761 --> 00:20:14,097
Belladonna would
help explain it.

00:20:15,365 --> 00:20:16,999
Later.

00:20:20,236 --> 00:20:22,505
Hey, I'm on a break.
I'll see you in 20.

00:20:22,572 --> 00:20:24,774
Vending machine's on
me if you give me
your results first.

00:20:24,841 --> 00:20:25,808
No, make it dinner.

00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:26,809
Me and you?

00:20:26,876 --> 00:20:29,345
Me, you and
my friend Julie.

00:20:29,412 --> 00:20:31,247
Okay, but I get
to sit in the middle.

00:20:31,314 --> 00:20:32,515
Deal.

00:20:32,582 --> 00:20:34,884
So the isolated blood drops
from behind the register

00:20:34,951 --> 00:20:37,320
are not a match to your vic.

00:20:37,387 --> 00:20:40,390
In fact, they are male.

00:20:40,456 --> 00:20:43,026
Really?

00:20:43,092 --> 00:20:44,193
Can I have the file?

00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,629
Later.

00:20:46,696 --> 00:20:48,831
So, Mandy says that
you have a suspect.

00:20:48,898 --> 00:20:50,266
The guy have any cuts?

00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:51,768
Warrick didn't find any,

00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:53,202
and the suspect
had an alibi.

00:20:53,269 --> 00:20:55,238
But I think you just
broke the case.

00:20:55,304 --> 00:20:56,906
How'd I do that?

00:20:56,973 --> 00:20:58,775
Well, one of the broken jars
at the store

00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:00,376
contained belladonna,
which is a poison.

00:21:00,443 --> 00:21:02,211
The vic only
inhaled it,

00:21:02,278 --> 00:21:04,414
but if the killer had
an open wound,

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,715
he not only
inhaled it...

00:21:05,782 --> 00:21:07,784
it went directly
into his bloodstream.

00:21:10,787 --> 00:21:13,122
I need to check the hospitals.

00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,560
Got to hand it to you,
Sanders-- nice call.

00:21:17,627 --> 00:21:19,662
They brought the guy
in after he ran his car

00:21:19,729 --> 00:21:22,031
up onto a median,
right behind the Las Vegas sign.

00:21:22,098 --> 00:21:24,400
That's like ten blocks
from the crime scene.

00:21:24,467 --> 00:21:25,935
Yeah.
Name's Damon Mitchell.

00:21:26,002 --> 00:21:28,104
Showed symptoms
of narcotics withdrawal.

00:21:28,171 --> 00:21:29,772
According
to the police report,

00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:32,341
he ran his car off the road
up onto the median.

00:21:32,408 --> 00:21:34,210
No damage to the car,
no injuries.

00:21:34,277 --> 00:21:37,113
But he's apparently hyped up
on something.

00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,281
What do you got, Doc?

00:21:38,348 --> 00:21:41,017
Well, the lab just confirmed
his blood is positive

00:21:41,084 --> 00:21:42,485
for atropine.

00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:44,320
So I'm starting him
on an IV drip

00:21:44,387 --> 00:21:45,988
of physostigmine.

00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:47,690
You swab that wound
on his hand yet?

00:21:47,757 --> 00:21:48,825
Right when he came in.

00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:50,159
Swab's still around?

00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:52,295
Saved it for you.
It's in the biohazard bag.

00:21:53,963 --> 00:21:55,565
Mr. Mitchell?

00:21:55,631 --> 00:21:58,735
I'm Detective Vega.

00:21:58,801 --> 00:22:02,572
( <i>distorted voice</i> ):
Mind if I ask you
a few questions?

00:22:02,638 --> 00:22:05,508
Oh... man.

00:22:05,575 --> 00:22:07,710
Your face is melting.

00:22:09,011 --> 00:22:11,414
I think I'm going to puke.

00:22:11,481 --> 00:22:13,950
Make sure you book him
when he gets sober.

00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:20,556
JAMESON:
I got a psychic who can
communicate with the dead.

00:22:20,623 --> 00:22:22,692
The FBI uses her
to locate people.

00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:25,028
Your dead wife's
been talking to her.

00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:27,697
Says her spirit is stuck
in Summerlin.

00:22:27,764 --> 00:22:29,065
She can't cross over

00:22:29,132 --> 00:22:32,802
until the bastard who
murdered her is caught.

00:22:32,869 --> 00:22:35,872
Psychic says, it's you.

00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:37,573
GRISSOM:
Watch this again.

00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,575
( <i>tape rewinds</i> )

00:22:39,642 --> 00:22:42,678
JAMESON:
Your dead wife's
been talking to her.

00:22:42,745 --> 00:22:45,381
Says her spirit is stuck
in Summerlin.

00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:46,649
She can't cross over
until the bastard

00:22:46,716 --> 00:22:48,217
who murdered her is caught.

00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:51,120
BRASS:
Yeah, Packey, said he got
a rise out of him.

00:22:51,187 --> 00:22:53,056
Right when he mentions
Summerlin.

00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:54,691
So, old Packey has
been punching holes

00:22:54,757 --> 00:22:57,026
in the wrong part of the
desert all these years, huh?

00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:00,375
Sir?
Yeah?

00:23:00,375 --> 00:23:02,458
You said you wanted the print
results as soon as I got them?

00:23:02,458 --> 00:23:03,166
Yes.

00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:04,701
I tried to run
Wallace's ten card,

00:23:04,767 --> 00:23:06,536
but the finger rolls
were too sloppy.

00:23:06,602 --> 00:23:08,604
So I used the latents
from the crime scene

00:23:08,671 --> 00:23:09,772
against the AFIS
civil database,

00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:11,607
knowing he'd be in there,
'cause he used to be a cop.

00:23:11,674 --> 00:23:12,642
Did you get a hit?

00:23:12,709 --> 00:23:14,377
Yeah, I got two.
Uh, Wallace's prints were

00:23:14,444 --> 00:23:15,778
on the inside
of the door handle.

00:23:15,845 --> 00:23:17,780
That places him at the scene.

00:23:17,847 --> 00:23:19,148
Well, what do you know?

00:23:19,215 --> 00:23:20,850
Were the other ones Greg's?

00:23:20,917 --> 00:23:22,652
No. They were another cop.

00:23:22,719 --> 00:23:24,821
A... retired
Detective Patrick Jameson.

00:23:24,887 --> 00:23:28,424
Yeah, Packey said he went
there to get a reading.

00:23:28,491 --> 00:23:30,360
WEBSTER:
Yeah. Found a few on the table,

00:23:30,426 --> 00:23:31,861
then there were a few more
on the broken jars

00:23:31,928 --> 00:23:33,029
that were found behind
the counter.

00:23:33,096 --> 00:23:35,431
Why was he behind the counter?

00:23:35,498 --> 00:23:37,800
Come on. Why would Packey want
to kill Sedona?

00:23:44,417 --> 00:23:46,318
I need to talk to you.

00:23:46,385 --> 00:23:48,254
You heard
about the strip club?

00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,156
I hear about
everything, Greg.

00:23:50,222 --> 00:23:52,091
Then that ear surgery
paid off.

00:23:52,158 --> 00:23:55,561
Our first lead didn't pan out,
but I got a better one.

00:23:55,628 --> 00:23:57,463
Damon Mitchell crashed
his black Chevy

00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:00,032
into a median only ten blocks
from the occult shop,

00:24:00,099 --> 00:24:02,334
right around the time
the psychic was killed.

00:24:02,401 --> 00:24:05,271
His prints match latents
we found at the scene.

00:24:05,337 --> 00:24:06,472
He was hospitalized

00:24:06,539 --> 00:24:09,442
for what turned out to be
belladonna poisoning.

00:24:09,508 --> 00:24:10,443
And get this--

00:24:10,509 --> 00:24:13,779
He worked the National
Finals Rodeo last year.

00:24:13,846 --> 00:24:17,249
Slam dunk. I'm meeting Vega
at P.D. in 20 minutes.

00:24:17,316 --> 00:24:18,651
We have one more lead
to follow up

00:24:18,718 --> 00:24:20,019
before we call this
a slam dunk.

00:24:20,086 --> 00:24:21,721
What lead?

00:24:21,787 --> 00:24:23,856
I don't think your
sixth sense is working

00:24:23,923 --> 00:24:25,091
as well as you'd hoped.

00:24:25,157 --> 00:24:27,226
Are you accusing me
of something?

00:24:27,293 --> 00:24:29,195
Oh, come on, Packey,
you know how this works.

00:24:29,261 --> 00:24:31,297
I'm just trying to put
the pieces together.

00:24:31,364 --> 00:24:33,432
I went to Sedona's shop
for a consultation.

00:24:33,499 --> 00:24:35,368
I brought her
Claire Wallace's sweater,

00:24:35,434 --> 00:24:37,203
from the car we found
at the airport.

00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:38,471
And for your information,

00:24:38,537 --> 00:24:40,206
I signed it
in and out of evidence,

00:24:40,272 --> 00:24:42,608
per chain of custody.
Okay...

00:24:42,675 --> 00:24:44,710
I also showed her
a couple of photos.

00:24:44,777 --> 00:24:46,879
She did her thing;
I paid her; I left.

00:24:46,946 --> 00:24:48,848
So you were only in the back
of the shop?

00:24:48,914 --> 00:24:49,915
You've been there.

00:24:49,982 --> 00:24:51,884
You know you have to walk
from the front

00:24:51,951 --> 00:24:52,952
to get to the back.

00:24:53,018 --> 00:24:55,221
Now, come on, Jim.
You want ask me something?

00:24:55,287 --> 00:24:56,288
Don't be shy.

00:24:56,355 --> 00:24:57,957
Somebody trashed the place,

00:24:58,024 --> 00:25:01,360
and we found your prints,
on the pieces of broken glass.

00:25:01,427 --> 00:25:02,862
And you think, what, I did it?

00:25:02,928 --> 00:25:04,430
No, but I want to know
what your prints are doing

00:25:04,497 --> 00:25:05,564
on those glass jars.

00:25:05,631 --> 00:25:07,033
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:25:07,099 --> 00:25:10,202
She had all these weird
powders and fairy dust,

00:25:10,269 --> 00:25:12,738
and something called
a gris-gris bag.

00:25:12,805 --> 00:25:15,641
Said she had
her mojo working.

00:25:15,708 --> 00:25:17,910
Seemed sketchy.
I figured she was dealing.

00:25:17,977 --> 00:25:21,280
Oh... I don't know, Packey,
that's a stretch.

00:25:21,347 --> 00:25:23,282
Come on, Jim. You know
these hippy-dippy types.

00:25:23,349 --> 00:25:25,117
They love their drugs,
so I questioned her.

00:25:25,184 --> 00:25:27,820
Got a lesson in alchemy.

00:25:27,887 --> 00:25:31,891
Have you ever seen
a wolf's heart?

00:25:31,957 --> 00:25:34,660
A dried bat?

00:25:34,727 --> 00:25:36,295
Well, I held 'em.

00:25:36,362 --> 00:25:38,130
Satisfied?

00:25:38,197 --> 00:25:40,466
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:25:46,138 --> 00:25:48,908
Can I get some more water?

00:25:48,974 --> 00:25:51,544
We're all out.

00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:54,180
Mr. Mitchell,
are you into psychics?

00:25:54,246 --> 00:25:58,250
No. I'm not...
I'm really thirsty.

00:25:58,317 --> 00:26:00,953
Doctor said push the fluids.

00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,155
We know that you went
to an occult shop.

00:26:03,222 --> 00:26:04,957
Yeah, you left
your fingerprints

00:26:05,024 --> 00:26:06,659
and your blood
at the location.

00:26:06,726 --> 00:26:08,494
And according
to this tox report,

00:26:08,561 --> 00:26:11,230
you were most likely
poisoned at the same place.

00:26:11,297 --> 00:26:13,332
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:26:13,399 --> 00:26:16,202
Okay. I was there,

00:26:16,268 --> 00:26:20,306
but I didn't kill
that little con artist bitch.

00:26:20,373 --> 00:26:22,141
Then why lie about it?

00:26:22,208 --> 00:26:23,743
'Cause I didn't think
you'd believe me.

00:26:23,809 --> 00:26:25,044
I'm in enough trouble already.

00:26:25,111 --> 00:26:26,545
Give it a shot.

00:26:26,612 --> 00:26:28,781
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:26:28,848 --> 00:26:30,483
My wife is a junky.

00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:32,485
She's a psychic junky.

00:26:32,551 --> 00:26:35,154
She spent our entire savings
on consultations,

00:26:35,221 --> 00:26:37,423
tarot readings
and other garbage.

00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:38,858
<i>Thousands</i> of dollars.

00:26:38,924 --> 00:26:41,761
I told her she had to quit
seeing this woman.

00:26:41,827 --> 00:26:44,630
That was my mistake.

00:26:44,697 --> 00:26:47,099
The week after, Sedona
starts having these visions

00:26:47,166 --> 00:26:48,434
of me cheating.

00:26:48,501 --> 00:26:52,571
You ever try to defend yourself
against a psychic's vision?

00:26:52,638 --> 00:26:54,440
I bet that pissed you off.

00:26:54,507 --> 00:26:56,208
So you got revenge by...

00:26:56,275 --> 00:26:58,677
I went down there
to confront the bitch

00:26:58,744 --> 00:27:00,479
because she ruined my life.

00:27:00,546 --> 00:27:02,848
You want to know
what she said to me?

00:27:02,915 --> 00:27:04,517
You want your wife back?

00:27:04,583 --> 00:27:06,886
That's going
to cost you $5,000.

00:27:06,952 --> 00:27:08,287
What?!
Cash.

00:27:08,354 --> 00:27:11,857
I will look into her
future and I'll tell her

00:27:11,924 --> 00:27:13,759
that she takes you back,

00:27:13,826 --> 00:27:15,061
and you live happily
ever after.

00:27:15,127 --> 00:27:17,263
She tried to extort
more money from me

00:27:17,329 --> 00:27:19,331
after she had already
taken it all.

00:27:19,398 --> 00:27:20,700
I lost it.

00:27:20,766 --> 00:27:23,502
You think this is funny?

00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:33,312
Mr. Mitchell, do you own a gun?

00:27:33,379 --> 00:27:36,982
No. Look, when I left there,
she was alive.

00:27:37,049 --> 00:27:38,484
What time was that?

00:27:38,551 --> 00:27:41,787
It was after 9:00,
around... closer to 9:30.

00:27:41,854 --> 00:27:42,988
Then where'd you go?

00:27:43,055 --> 00:27:44,790
Uh... I went around the corner

00:27:44,857 --> 00:27:46,992
to the liquor store
for some bourbon.

00:27:47,059 --> 00:27:50,830
But before I even opened it,
I started to feel whoozy.

00:27:50,896 --> 00:27:55,835
You know, then... everything
kind of went sideways.

00:27:55,901 --> 00:27:57,169
The cops find the gun

00:27:57,236 --> 00:27:59,305
or the stolen cash
in the vehicle?

00:27:59,372 --> 00:28:00,906
No. Only a full bottle
of bourbon.

00:28:00,973 --> 00:28:02,441
But he could've ditched
the gun.

00:28:02,508 --> 00:28:04,577
Well, the victim took him
for several grand.

00:28:04,643 --> 00:28:05,978
He's not ditching the money.

00:28:06,045 --> 00:28:07,079
Tight suit, baby.

00:28:07,146 --> 00:28:09,648
Actually, it's not.
Um, I've only gained

00:28:09,715 --> 00:28:12,318
a couple of pounds,
and I tend to gain...

00:28:12,385 --> 00:28:14,520
No, I mean it,
looks good on you.

00:28:14,587 --> 00:28:15,521
I see. Well...

00:28:15,588 --> 00:28:16,856
Thank you, Warrick.

00:28:16,922 --> 00:28:18,758
So, what's with the ghetto?

00:28:18,824 --> 00:28:20,226
I was with Conrad and the mayor

00:28:20,292 --> 00:28:21,827
at the city council
budget meeting,

00:28:21,894 --> 00:28:23,662
requesting more funds
for you slackers.

00:28:23,729 --> 00:28:26,465
So you probably didn't have
any time to get some work done?

00:28:26,532 --> 00:28:30,269
<i>Au contraire.</i>
Multitasking is my forte.

00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:33,272
In fact, I shared your results
with the city council.

00:28:33,339 --> 00:28:36,008
Fine crime fighting,
courtesy of your trace lab.

00:28:36,075 --> 00:28:37,743
The gold flecks
that you pulled

00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:39,945
from the cash register
was iron pyrite,

00:28:40,012 --> 00:28:41,647
commonly known
as fool's gold.

00:28:41,714 --> 00:28:43,449
What was it doing
in the cash register?

00:28:43,516 --> 00:28:45,684
It's also known
as prosperity dust.

00:28:45,751 --> 00:28:47,420
It could be for good luck.

00:28:47,486 --> 00:28:49,588
Didn't work for Sedona Wiley.

00:28:52,391 --> 00:28:54,560
( <i>hammering</i> )

00:28:56,662 --> 00:28:58,364
Jim Brass.

00:28:58,431 --> 00:28:59,999
Been a long time.

00:29:00,066 --> 00:29:02,234
How's it going, Gordon?

00:29:02,301 --> 00:29:04,170
This is Gil Grissom
from the crime lab.

00:29:04,236 --> 00:29:07,540
So, Gordon, where were you
the night before last

00:29:07,606 --> 00:29:09,075
between 6:30 and 10:00.

00:29:09,141 --> 00:29:12,244
Well, I'm working 24-7
for Joslynn Raines

00:29:12,311 --> 00:29:13,846
while she's in town,

00:29:13,913 --> 00:29:16,882
so I was here with my crew
until 10:00.

00:29:16,949 --> 00:29:20,419
Raced over to the airport,
picked up my brother.

00:29:20,486 --> 00:29:22,855
Flew in from Florida,
landed around 10:30.

00:29:22,922 --> 00:29:25,191
Brought him back here
for the last show.

00:29:25,257 --> 00:29:28,027
You ever been
to the Sixth Sense Occult Shop?

00:29:28,094 --> 00:29:29,662
( <i>scoffs</i> )

00:29:29,729 --> 00:29:31,030
What? That's funny?

00:29:31,097 --> 00:29:32,264
Nah, it's just, I...

00:29:32,331 --> 00:29:34,433
I thought you were busting
my chops

00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,768
for your boy, Jameson.

00:29:35,835 --> 00:29:37,436
Yeah, I was there,
earlier this week.

00:29:37,503 --> 00:29:39,071
Joslynn wanted to buy
a love potion.

00:29:39,138 --> 00:29:42,041
Despite her
killer looks,

00:29:42,108 --> 00:29:46,245
the young lady is unlucky
in the romance department.

00:29:46,312 --> 00:29:47,813
You don't believe me?

00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,515
Let's go ask her.

00:29:49,582 --> 00:29:51,917
Hey, Joslynn

00:29:51,984 --> 00:29:55,154
Can you spare a minute
for the, uh, boys in blue?

00:29:55,221 --> 00:29:58,557
Friends of yours?
Sure. Nice to meet you.

00:29:58,624 --> 00:30:00,626
Love your city.

00:30:00,693 --> 00:30:02,828
So you got a pen,
or...?

00:30:05,698 --> 00:30:07,033
Um, Miss Raines,

00:30:07,099 --> 00:30:10,870
were you at the Sixth Sense
Occult Shop earlier this week?

00:30:10,936 --> 00:30:12,204
Yeah. Gordie took me.

00:30:12,271 --> 00:30:14,707
I got a reading,
picked up a few things.

00:30:14,774 --> 00:30:20,546
Uh-huh. Did, uh, did Gordie
go inside the shop with you?

00:30:20,613 --> 00:30:22,815
Mm-hmm.
He goes where I go.

00:30:25,151 --> 00:30:28,421
I offered to pay to clear his
aura, but he wasn't in to it.

00:30:28,487 --> 00:30:30,589
It's good for his soul.

00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:32,391
Are we done?

00:30:32,458 --> 00:30:33,926
You're going to need to...

00:30:33,993 --> 00:30:36,262
exit out the front.

00:30:36,328 --> 00:30:37,563
Maybe we can get
a warrant

00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:39,465
and match the glass
in Wallace's shoe

00:30:39,532 --> 00:30:41,233
to the glass we found
at the scene,

00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,835
and then tie him
to the murder.

00:30:42,902 --> 00:30:44,970
I don't know how.
Glass breaks all the time.

00:30:45,037 --> 00:30:46,172
It's not a unique event.

00:30:46,238 --> 00:30:47,973
Plus, he admits
to being in the shop,

00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,475
which accounts for his prints.

00:30:49,542 --> 00:30:51,143
You know, maybe
Packey was right--

00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:53,079
maybe Wallace did kill
that psychic.

00:30:53,145 --> 00:30:56,015
Well, he'd only kill her
if he also killed his wife.

00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,489
This is the map I've
been working off of,

00:31:03,556 --> 00:31:05,191
and each of these
red stickers

00:31:05,257 --> 00:31:06,492
represents
a hole I dug

00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,260
based on different
information.

00:31:08,327 --> 00:31:10,996
Now, most were around the house
he owned in Sunrise Manor.

00:31:11,063 --> 00:31:13,933
These were near his, uh,
brother's place,

00:31:13,999 --> 00:31:15,801
and a few near
his sister's place.

00:31:15,868 --> 00:31:17,636
That's where they grew up,
in Henderson.

00:31:17,703 --> 00:31:19,805
So you never looked
in Summerlin?

00:31:19,872 --> 00:31:21,207
No reason to.

00:31:21,273 --> 00:31:23,409
It says here,
when Wallace was a cop,

00:31:23,476 --> 00:31:25,478
he worked
the Northwest substation,

00:31:25,544 --> 00:31:26,979
that includes Summerlin.

00:31:27,046 --> 00:31:29,115
Yeah, but he hadn't been
on the job that long,

00:31:29,181 --> 00:31:31,016
and Summerlin is
out of his comfort zone

00:31:31,083 --> 00:31:33,352
and a long way
from where they live.

00:31:33,419 --> 00:31:36,455
No, he... he had better options
closer to home.

00:31:36,522 --> 00:31:38,657
So, where would
his parameters be?

00:31:38,724 --> 00:31:41,827
Well, he'd pick a place
where people don't normally go.

00:31:41,894 --> 00:31:44,730
Wallace worked Northwest

00:31:44,797 --> 00:31:48,534
from January 1990
to August '92.

00:31:48,601 --> 00:31:53,539
He responded to like 20 crime
scenes in Summerlin.

00:31:53,606 --> 00:31:57,576
If we just limit it down
to the remote location...

00:31:57,643 --> 00:32:00,179
Let me look at that.

00:32:00,246 --> 00:32:03,582
BROWN:
Summerlin's changed a lot
over the last ten years.

00:32:03,649 --> 00:32:07,019
Yeah, but there's two...

00:32:07,086 --> 00:32:10,189
<i>three,</i> possibilities.

00:32:10,256 --> 00:32:11,924
I got an idea.

00:32:11,991 --> 00:32:14,026
( <i>garbled police radio</i>
<i>transmissions</i> )

00:32:18,531 --> 00:32:20,132
Back in the day,
squatters were

00:32:20,199 --> 00:32:22,635
always camping their
RVs in this area.

00:32:22,702 --> 00:32:24,737
That's what brought
Wallace up here.

00:32:24,804 --> 00:32:27,673
Illegal dumping of human waste
on public lands.

00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:30,409
( <i>beeping</i> )

00:32:32,812 --> 00:32:34,146
( <i>rapid beeping</i> )

00:32:34,213 --> 00:32:35,748
Grissom!

00:32:37,149 --> 00:32:38,317
I've got something!

00:32:39,652 --> 00:32:41,887
GRISSOM:
Metallic signature.

00:32:41,954 --> 00:32:43,889
This could be
the abandoned septic tank.

00:32:43,956 --> 00:32:46,092
Time to find out.

00:32:46,158 --> 00:32:49,628
( <i>garbled police radio</i>
<i>transmissions continue</i> )

00:32:58,537 --> 00:33:00,773
( <i>panting</i> )

00:33:16,055 --> 00:33:18,124
( <i>Brown grunts</i> )

00:33:23,529 --> 00:33:25,364
Clear!

00:33:57,997 --> 00:34:00,232
Mrs. Wallace, I presume.

00:34:13,875 --> 00:34:14,875
Hey, Greg.

00:34:15,792 --> 00:34:18,161
You missed some.

00:34:19,195 --> 00:34:20,864
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:34:21,898 --> 00:34:26,002
Well, one more spider bite
won't make a difference.

00:34:26,069 --> 00:34:27,837
But you,
being the bug guy,

00:34:27,904 --> 00:34:31,274
would probably enjoy
being bitten.

00:34:47,857 --> 00:34:49,626
SANDERS:
Could be a rib.

00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:53,496
It's too small.

00:34:59,369 --> 00:35:01,304
Did the Wallaces
have a kid?

00:35:01,371 --> 00:35:05,275
No. That was part
of the marital discord.

00:35:05,342 --> 00:35:07,043
SANDERS:
Check this out.

00:35:12,549 --> 00:35:16,519
Claire Wallace did have a dog.

00:35:16,586 --> 00:35:18,154
Yeah. Yeah,
I interviewed her sister.

00:35:18,221 --> 00:35:21,524
Said Claire had
a little bulldog named, uh...

00:35:21,591 --> 00:35:22,459
think it was Sneakers.

00:35:22,525 --> 00:35:24,227
Took him everywhere with her.

00:35:24,294 --> 00:35:26,296
What's this around the neck?

00:35:28,431 --> 00:35:29,666
GRISSOM:
It's a wire.

00:35:29,733 --> 00:35:31,434
JAMESON:
Killed the dog.

00:35:31,501 --> 00:35:32,669
He had to kill the dog

00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:34,671
to make it look like
Claire took Sneakers with her.

00:35:34,738 --> 00:35:36,406
Otherwise, nobody'd believe
his story.

00:35:36,473 --> 00:35:38,842
SANDERS:
No collar or tags down here,

00:35:38,909 --> 00:35:41,578
but I found this...

00:35:41,645 --> 00:35:43,580
whatever it is.

00:35:51,755 --> 00:35:54,357
Really thin,
high-bridge nose.

00:35:54,424 --> 00:35:56,159
All indicate Caucasoid.

00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,962
GRISSOM:
Any chance at an I.D.?

00:35:59,029 --> 00:36:02,032
Well, so far, everything's
consistent with Claire Wallace.

00:36:02,098 --> 00:36:03,967
Unfortunately,
because she was in a metal box

00:36:04,034 --> 00:36:06,303
in the desert,
DNA's not likely viable.

00:36:06,369 --> 00:36:07,971
I sent samples
of the long bones

00:36:08,038 --> 00:36:10,974
to Wendy anyway,
but I don't expect results.

00:36:11,041 --> 00:36:12,509
Dental records?

00:36:12,576 --> 00:36:14,110
( <i>sighs</i> ):
The, uh, killer knocked out

00:36:14,177 --> 00:36:15,979
most of her teeth.

00:36:16,046 --> 00:36:17,781
Roots are still in the bone.

00:36:17,847 --> 00:36:20,016
She was brutalized.

00:36:21,051 --> 00:36:22,352
Cause of death?

00:36:22,419 --> 00:36:25,555
I noted three separate
and distinct fractures:

00:36:25,622 --> 00:36:27,490
one on the right side...

00:36:27,557 --> 00:36:30,060
and two distinct fractures
on the left side.

00:36:30,126 --> 00:36:34,030
We were able to identify
the missing skull fragments,

00:36:34,097 --> 00:36:36,833
but when I tried to fit them
back together, I couldn't.

00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,236
There was deformation
of the bones.

00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:44,007
Pre or peri-mortem,
the human skull has

00:36:44,074 --> 00:36:46,509
an elastic quality,
so when there's a fracture,

00:36:46,576 --> 00:36:48,845
the pieces will change shape.

00:36:48,912 --> 00:36:50,447
But post-mortem,

00:36:50,513 --> 00:36:53,016
the bone is brittle,
and when it's fractured,

00:36:53,083 --> 00:36:54,417
the pieces retain
their shape.

00:36:54,484 --> 00:36:56,820
It's not unlike breaking
a vase or a bowl.

00:36:56,886 --> 00:36:59,856
<i>The pieces all fit together</i>
<i>like a jigsaw puzzle.</i>

00:36:59,923 --> 00:37:03,059
So based on the fractures
to her skull,

00:37:03,126 --> 00:37:07,030
it appears she was struck in
the head three separate times,

00:37:07,097 --> 00:37:09,866
and since the pieces
won't fit back together,

00:37:09,933 --> 00:37:13,870
blunt force trauma to her skull
is your C.O.D.

00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:21,978
Did you know
that there are

00:37:22,045 --> 00:37:25,315
approximately 280
bones in a dog's body?

00:37:25,382 --> 00:37:26,583
Yeah?

00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:28,818
Well, the, uh, forensic vet
should be here soon.

00:37:28,885 --> 00:37:30,654
Hopefully, he'll be able
to determine

00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,689
whether this is
a French bulldog.

00:37:32,756 --> 00:37:35,225
I'm thinking
this dog was an amputee.

00:37:35,292 --> 00:37:36,159
Based on what?

00:37:36,226 --> 00:37:38,361
This contraption.

00:37:38,428 --> 00:37:40,363
Looks like the, uh,
canine equivalent

00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:41,665
of a wheelchair.

00:37:41,731 --> 00:37:45,335
My grandmother had a neighbor
whose dog was hit by a car.

00:37:45,402 --> 00:37:47,837
The dog lived,
but the doctor had to amputate

00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:51,174
the hind legs mid-femur.

00:37:51,241 --> 00:37:55,111
This is the hind femur,
or what's left of it.

00:37:55,178 --> 00:37:57,113
You see how it was cut?

00:38:00,884 --> 00:38:02,786
You know, if Sneakers here
was a handicapped dog,

00:38:02,852 --> 00:38:05,689
I.D.ing it just became
a whole lot easier.

00:38:05,755 --> 00:38:07,791
If we can I.D. the dog,
it'd at least give us

00:38:07,857 --> 00:38:10,493
a compelling argument
that the body found
was Claire Wallace.

00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,963
Yeah, but even with a cause
of death of blunt force trauma,

00:38:13,029 --> 00:38:14,497
we still don't have enough
to arrest him.

00:38:14,564 --> 00:38:17,467
So what, we focus
on Sedona Wiley?

00:38:17,534 --> 00:38:18,802
Well, it's like
a Chinese puzzle.

00:38:18,868 --> 00:38:21,104
She knew who Wallace was,
but Wallace didn't know her.

00:38:21,171 --> 00:38:22,973
Greg's suspect,
Damon Mitchell,

00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:25,475
claims that she tried
to extort money from him.

00:38:25,542 --> 00:38:29,045
So maybe
she hit up Wallace, too.

00:38:30,046 --> 00:38:33,450
JOHNSON:
702-555-0122.

00:38:33,516 --> 00:38:35,151
That's GW Security.

00:38:35,218 --> 00:38:36,486
That's Wallace's company.

00:38:36,553 --> 00:38:37,821
She called that number
three times

00:38:37,887 --> 00:38:39,189
in the last week or so.

00:38:39,256 --> 00:38:41,625
She was reaching out to him.

00:38:41,691 --> 00:38:43,927
She called him again four days
before she was murdered.

00:38:43,994 --> 00:38:45,729
Upping the ante, maybe.

00:38:50,367 --> 00:38:51,801
WILEY:
Hi.

00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:56,973
GRISSOM:
<i>Maybe Wallace went there</i>
<i>to intimidate Sedona.</i>

00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,275
BRASS:
So she was
shaking him down

00:38:58,341 --> 00:39:00,577
when he went in the
store to shake her up.

00:39:00,644 --> 00:39:01,578
You know, Wallace said

00:39:01,645 --> 00:39:03,947
it was the singer's idea
to go in there, not his.

00:39:04,014 --> 00:39:06,216
Yeah, he also said
he didn't murder his wife.

00:39:06,283 --> 00:39:08,752
You know, the girls said
something curious--

00:39:08,818 --> 00:39:11,021
the two that found
the body.

00:39:11,087 --> 00:39:12,622
I didn't think
it was important at the time.

00:39:12,689 --> 00:39:15,659
When they left the store,
a car almost ran them down.

00:39:17,027 --> 00:39:18,461
( <i>tires screeching</i> )

00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:20,430
Jerk!

00:39:21,631 --> 00:39:24,234
So, your hand made contact
with the hood of the car?

00:39:24,301 --> 00:39:26,369
You bet it did.
I was born in Manhattan.

00:39:26,436 --> 00:39:27,804
Well, I'm going to
need an impression

00:39:27,871 --> 00:39:29,406
of your palm and
your fingerprints.

00:39:29,472 --> 00:39:31,575
If it helps nail the guy, sure.

00:39:31,641 --> 00:39:33,510
BRASS:
Do you remember anything
about the vehicle?

00:39:33,577 --> 00:39:36,479
Was it a car,
a truck, SUV?

00:39:36,546 --> 00:39:38,315
I think it was a car.

00:39:38,381 --> 00:39:39,816
What color was it?

00:39:39,883 --> 00:39:41,384
It was red.

00:39:41,451 --> 00:39:43,119
Stuck in my head
after what the psychic said.

00:39:43,186 --> 00:39:45,989
Blood red.

00:39:46,056 --> 00:39:48,058
( <i>indistinct chattering</i> )

00:40:10,247 --> 00:40:12,249
Voila.

00:40:16,353 --> 00:40:18,722
WALLACE:
You dragged me out
of the show for this?

00:40:18,788 --> 00:40:22,626
You're dusting
my car?

00:40:22,692 --> 00:40:24,527
You sad old man.

00:40:25,695 --> 00:40:27,564
Is this all you have
to live for?

00:40:29,232 --> 00:40:30,533
Palm prints on the hood
of the car

00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,968
appears to be
a solid match

00:40:32,035 --> 00:40:32,969
to Anna Leah.

00:40:33,036 --> 00:40:34,137
Who's that?

00:40:34,204 --> 00:40:36,039
She's a good witness
who places your car

00:40:36,106 --> 00:40:38,041
outside the shop
on the night of the murder.

00:40:38,108 --> 00:40:40,710
Maybe I was in the neighborhood.

00:40:40,777 --> 00:40:42,646
It's not a crime to drive

00:40:42,712 --> 00:40:43,647
around Vegas.

00:40:43,713 --> 00:40:46,182
I was only in
that shop once,

00:40:46,249 --> 00:40:47,884
and I got my own witness.

00:40:47,951 --> 00:40:49,319
You got nothing.

00:40:51,254 --> 00:40:54,491
Our warrant also includes
your shoes.

00:40:54,557 --> 00:40:56,927
You like 'em? They're new.

00:40:56,993 --> 00:40:59,996
Threw the old
ones away.

00:41:00,063 --> 00:41:02,232
May I take a look
at your wallet, please?

00:41:02,299 --> 00:41:03,366
What for?

00:41:03,433 --> 00:41:05,435
Because I can.

00:41:19,849 --> 00:41:22,419
You didn't make a purchase
at that shop, did you?

00:41:22,485 --> 00:41:24,621
Already told you that.

00:41:25,655 --> 00:41:26,590
Gold flecks...

00:41:26,656 --> 00:41:28,491
similar to the substance
we found

00:41:28,558 --> 00:41:31,161
in Sedona Wiley's
cash register.

00:41:39,769 --> 00:41:42,606
You took the money
to make it look like a robbery.

00:41:42,672 --> 00:41:44,207
JAMESON:
We got him.

00:41:44,274 --> 00:41:46,943
BRASS:
You know, Packey, you've been
waiting a long time for this.

00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:48,745
Why don't you take him down?

00:41:50,614 --> 00:41:53,416
I couldn't get you
for the murder of your wife,

00:41:53,483 --> 00:41:54,985
but you are now
under arrest

00:41:55,051 --> 00:41:57,554
for the murder
of Sedona Wiley.

00:42:03,526 --> 00:42:06,329
You have to admit,
it's, uh, pretty eerie--

00:42:06,396 --> 00:42:08,832
Sedona's visions
of her own death.

00:42:08,899 --> 00:42:12,669
Yeah. Maybe you
should ask Nana Olaf

00:42:12,736 --> 00:42:14,771
to contact her,
see how she's doing.

00:42:15,805 --> 00:42:18,174
Yeah, I know you're a cynic.

00:42:18,241 --> 00:42:21,678
I just think
that you can have beliefs

00:42:21,745 --> 00:42:24,414
and still be a scientist.

00:42:24,481 --> 00:42:26,016
I agree.

00:42:26,082 --> 00:42:28,518
The problems arise
when people mistake

00:42:28,585 --> 00:42:30,420
their beliefs
for the science.

00:42:32,122 --> 00:42:34,791
I've been reading her notebooks.

00:42:37,627 --> 00:42:41,131
Take a look at this.

00:42:46,002 --> 00:42:50,140
"She is in Summerland...

00:42:50,206 --> 00:42:53,276
"but there is chaos
and darkness surrounding her.

00:42:53,343 --> 00:42:58,448
She is in Summerland,
but she can't cross over yet."

00:42:59,482 --> 00:43:02,819
Sedona said Claire Wallace
was "in Summerland,"

00:43:02,886 --> 00:43:05,155
not buried in Summerlin.

00:43:05,221 --> 00:43:07,324
What's Summerland?

00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:09,159
Pagans believe
it's a mystical place

00:43:09,225 --> 00:43:12,195
where souls go to rest
before they reincarnate.

00:43:13,229 --> 00:43:16,066
So Jameson heard Summerlin...

00:43:16,132 --> 00:43:18,335
Because he was desperate
to solve the case.

00:43:18,401 --> 00:43:20,837
Then when Wallace
heard Summerlin...

00:43:20,904 --> 00:43:23,974
he assumed
Sedona was the real deal.

00:43:26,875 --> 00:43:28,333
The power of suggestion.
