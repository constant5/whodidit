00:13:55,579 --> 00:13:56,913
if that's
what you're getting at.

00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,148
Was she ever in your house?

00:13:58,215 --> 00:14:01,485
Yeah, I invited her over
to see my collection.

00:14:01,551 --> 00:14:03,854
Look, I'll admit that
I was attracted to her,

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,656
but when she told me
her real age,

00:14:05,722 --> 00:14:07,424
I told her,
it was inappropriate

00:14:07,491 --> 00:14:08,792
for us to see each other.

00:14:08,859 --> 00:14:10,560
How very responsible of you.

00:14:10,627 --> 00:14:12,429

00:14:12,496 --> 00:14:14,831

before she went missing?

00:14:21,838 --> 00:14:24,141
We found an old blood pool
in your living room.

00:14:24,207 --> 00:14:25,776
You want to tell me about that?

00:14:25,842 --> 00:14:26,677
Don't answer that.

00:14:26,743 --> 00:14:28,345
Ms. Willows,
let's get something straight.

00:14:28,412 --> 00:14:29,846
You found a body

00:14:29,913 --> 00:14:32,349
in the chimney, so you searched
his house for clues,

00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:34,851
but you had no legal right
to look for any evidence

00:14:34,918 --> 00:14:36,186
unrelated to this case.

00:14:36,253 --> 00:14:40,023
We were just working
the scene.

( <i>clears throat</i> )

00:14:45,429 --> 00:14:47,998
This piece of wood was
pried from you living room.

00:14:48,065 --> 00:14:50,300
The surface was scrubbed
with a cleaning agent,

00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:54,237
but we found a spot of blood...
right there.

00:14:56,873 --> 00:14:58,975
You mean, you ripped up
my damn floor.

00:14:59,042 --> 00:15:00,377
What is going on here?

00:15:00,444 --> 00:15:02,045
As soon as this is over,
I intend to file

00:15:02,112 --> 00:15:03,647
an emergency motion
to limit the scope

00:15:03,714 --> 00:15:04,748

00:15:04,815 --> 00:15:06,984

You have

00:15:21,064 --> 00:15:23,100

younger women?

00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:25,569
I had nothing to do
with that girl's

00:15:25,635 --> 00:15:26,970
You want to come after me?

00:15:27,037 --> 00:15:28,438
You're going to regret it.

00:15:28,505 --> 00:15:30,040
Your client has
a bit of a temper.

00:15:30,107 --> 00:15:31,641
Well, if you don't have
any questions

00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:33,510

Gentlemen,
this is Nick Stokes.

He's a colleague of mine.

00:15:49,126 --> 00:15:52,729
We found identification
on the decedent in the chimney.

00:15:52,796 --> 00:15:54,631
STOKES:
A gym card.

00:15:54,698 --> 00:15:55,999
Actually, it was found
in his pocket.

00:15:56,066 --> 00:15:57,534
The crime lab restored
the charred image,

00:15:57,601 --> 00:15:58,902
but we couldn't get a name.

00:15:58,969 --> 00:16:03,006
We we're hoping <i>you</i>
could help make a positive I.D.

00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:16,420
This belonged to the person
in my chimney?

00:16:16,486 --> 00:16:18,622
Yes, sir. You recognize him?

00:16:25,662 --> 00:16:29,232
Well, this is-this is Tad.

00:16:29,299 --> 00:16:31,935
This is my son.

00:16:40,654 --> 00:16:42,363
Let me guess:
he burned to death.

00:16:42,363 --> 00:16:44,232
I can't confirm C.O.D.

00:16:44,298 --> 00:16:47,335
Come on, Doc, this
isn't a hard one.

00:16:47,401 --> 00:16:50,137
His bones are fractured;
check out the femur.

00:16:50,204 --> 00:16:51,138
It's not uncommon
to find

00:16:51,205 --> 00:16:53,174
bone fractures
in fire victims.

00:16:53,241 --> 00:16:54,375
<i>The body produces heat,</i>

<i>causing the long bones</i>
<i>to contract and fracture.</i>

00:16:56,511 --> 00:16:57,645
Well, that's right,

00:16:57,712 --> 00:16:59,680
but check out the chips
in the skull.

00:16:59,747 --> 00:17:02,216
Bone chipping is also
a symptom of extreme heat.

You see the blood spot

Yeah...
As far as I know,

fire can't explain
a subdural hemotoma.

00:17:20,868 --> 00:17:22,470
No. No, it can't.

00:17:22,537 --> 00:17:24,705
Our victim suffered

about this?

00:22:28,509 --> 00:22:30,778
I never noticed it.

00:22:30,845 --> 00:22:32,680
You mind if I take
it with me?

00:22:32,747 --> 00:22:35,149
Go ahead;
take whatever you want.

00:22:37,185 --> 00:22:40,321
Look, there's this rumor
going around campus

00:22:40,388 --> 00:22:43,558
that if your roommate dies,
you get an automatic 4.0

00:22:43,624 --> 00:22:45,193
for the semester.

00:22:45,259 --> 00:22:46,527
You know, because
of all

00:22:46,594 --> 00:22:48,029
of the
traumatic stress.

00:22:48,095 --> 00:22:50,832
Who... who should
I talk to about that?

00:22:53,067 --> 00:22:55,303
♪ ♪

00:23:10,718 --> 00:23:12,920
♪ ♪

00:23:43,484 --> 00:23:44,919

00:23:44,986 --> 00:23:46,921
Afraid it's not going
to be very helpful.

00:23:46,988 --> 00:23:48,022
Why?

00:23:48,089 --> 00:23:50,024
Polyethylene plastic.

I hope that's not
all you got.

00:23:56,764 --> 00:23:58,933
I don't understand.

00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,070
If you found blood
in Sidley's house,

00:24:03,137 --> 00:24:05,206
why isn't he in jail?

00:24:05,273 --> 00:24:08,109
I mean, can't you
at least hold him

00:24:08,176 --> 00:24:11,579
until you determine
whether or not it's Caroline's?

00:24:11,646 --> 00:24:13,581
That's not my decision
to be made.

00:24:13,648 --> 00:24:16,384
Unfortunately, the DA
feels that we need more.

00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:17,952
( <i>derisive snort</i> )

00:24:18,019 --> 00:24:21,556
It's just like a year ago.

00:24:21,622 --> 00:24:23,624
It wasn't enough
that I believed

00:24:23,691 --> 00:24:25,726
that Martin was sleeping
with my daughter...

00:24:25,793 --> 00:24:31,566
that she disappeared
on the way to his house.

00:24:31,632 --> 00:24:36,504
Ms. Willows, the man paid her
$800 for her photos

00:24:36,571 --> 00:24:38,272
and told her she had
a great eye.

00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:47,215
I brought her brushes
and combs.

00:24:47,281 --> 00:24:52,553
Anything else
I could find.

00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:56,057
Think you'll be able to get
enough DNA off that stuff?

00:24:56,123 --> 00:24:58,926
Oh, yes, absolutely.

00:25:05,333 --> 00:25:07,502
I know the cops say

00:25:07,568 --> 00:25:09,737
that if you don't find
them quickly,

00:25:09,804 --> 00:25:11,272
you don't usually
find them alive.

00:25:13,541 --> 00:25:19,614
But every time the phone rings
or there's a knock at the door,

00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:25,186
my first thought...
my first hope

00:25:25,253 --> 00:25:27,421
is that, uh...

00:25:27,488 --> 00:25:29,123
it's Caroline.

00:25:32,793 --> 00:25:38,633
Mr. Fitzgibbons, we found
your name and number

00:25:38,699 --> 00:25:43,538
written on a Post-it
in Tad Sidley's dorm room.

00:25:43,604 --> 00:25:45,940
Can you explain
how it got there?

00:25:46,007 --> 00:25:50,545
When you guys were first
investigating her disappearance,

00:25:50,611 --> 00:25:52,747
you couldn't get access
to Sidley's place,

00:25:52,813 --> 00:25:56,951
so I appealed to his kid.

00:25:57,018 --> 00:26:00,454
Okay, look, I may not
like my old man,

00:26:00,521 --> 00:26:01,455
but he's not
a killer.

00:26:01,522 --> 00:26:02,557
And if you think
he is,

00:26:02,623 --> 00:26:03,891
go to the cops.

00:26:03,958 --> 00:26:05,126
The cops can't
get a warrant.

00:26:05,193 --> 00:26:06,761
I'm not saying
he hurt Caroline,

00:26:06,828 --> 00:26:08,229
but maybe there's something
in your house

00:26:08,296 --> 00:26:09,397
that will help me find her.

00:26:09,463 --> 00:26:11,866
I'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry.

00:26:11,933 --> 00:26:13,034
I can't just...

00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,569
Look, maybe you could
just talk to him.

00:26:14,635 --> 00:26:16,971
Convince him to let me
take a look around the place.

00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:18,806
Look, I see my dad
once a month...

00:26:18,873 --> 00:26:20,608
when I pick up my check.

00:26:20,675 --> 00:26:22,210
He's not going
to listen to me.

00:26:22,276 --> 00:26:26,080
All right,
if you change your mind,

00:26:26,147 --> 00:26:28,015
give me a call.

00:26:28,082 --> 00:26:31,152
Anytime.

00:26:31,219 --> 00:26:34,055
Unfortunately,
I never heard from him.

00:26:38,759 --> 00:26:41,696
Ms. Willows...

00:26:41,762 --> 00:26:46,534
if the blood you found
matches my daughter's DNA,

00:26:46,601 --> 00:26:50,638
tell me that the bastard's
going to jail...

00:26:50,705 --> 00:26:54,141
for the rest of his life.

00:26:58,728 --> 00:27:00,104
So the DNA I extracted

00:27:00,104 --> 00:27:01,205
from the hair
on Caroline's brush

00:27:01,272 --> 00:27:03,374
is consistent with the blood
found on the wood floor.

00:27:03,441 --> 00:27:04,675
Thank you.
Case closed.

00:27:04,742 --> 00:27:07,545
Now wait a minute.
We only found a single
drop of blood.

00:27:07,612 --> 00:27:09,436
No doubt Sidley's
attorney will argue

00:27:09,436 --> 00:27:10,604
that Caroline may
have cut herself.

00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,539
He already admitted that
she was in his house.

00:27:12,606 --> 00:27:15,311
Oh, come on, you saw the amount
of fluorescence on that floor.

00:27:15,311 --> 00:27:17,714
You don't use a bucket of bleach
to clean up a paper cut.

00:27:17,781 --> 00:27:20,050
Yeah, and you don't get
a murder conviction

00:27:20,116 --> 00:27:21,151
off of a single drop
of a victim's blood.

00:27:21,217 --> 00:27:22,819
So you need to find the body.

00:27:22,886 --> 00:27:25,522
That would certainly help.

00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:35,732
CURTIS:
Sorry to interrupt.

00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:38,668
As per protocol, Metro flagged
Tad Sidley's credit cards.

00:27:38,735 --> 00:27:40,503
A couple of hours ago
someone used

00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:42,772
his Amex to purchase gas
in Seven Hills.

00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:44,407
Is that someone in custody?

00:27:44,474 --> 00:27:47,644
Unfortunately, the Gas and Go
cashier ran the card manually.

00:27:47,711 --> 00:27:50,046
So by the time the credit card
company flagged the purchase

00:27:50,113 --> 00:27:51,381
the guy had taken off.

00:27:51,448 --> 00:27:53,683
But the station has
video surveillance

00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,685
and the cashier claims
he could ID him.

00:27:55,752 --> 00:27:57,020
Have you told Nick and Sara?

00:27:57,087 --> 00:27:58,855
Nick's in the AV lab now

00:27:58,922 --> 00:28:00,190
with the videotape
and the cashier.

00:28:00,256 --> 00:28:03,193
So the next time this someone
uses the credit card...

00:28:03,259 --> 00:28:04,494
We're all over it.

00:28:06,429 --> 00:28:07,931
You sure you remember
this guy

00:28:07,997 --> 00:28:09,833
who stole
Tad Sidley's credit card?

00:28:09,899 --> 00:28:11,201
For sure.

00:28:11,267 --> 00:28:14,003
It was a platinum
and the guy was like young.

00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:17,273
I mean, I couldn't even
qualify for a Visa.

00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,209
Grissom, meet Larry.

00:28:19,275 --> 00:28:20,977
Larry's from
the Gas and Go.

00:28:21,044 --> 00:28:22,212
Thanks for
coming in, Larry.

00:28:22,278 --> 00:28:23,747
Oh, for sure.

00:28:29,452 --> 00:28:31,021
Wait.

00:28:31,087 --> 00:28:33,690
Stop... stop the video.

00:28:35,625 --> 00:28:37,160
Yeah, I remember
that jacket and the blond hair.

00:28:37,227 --> 00:28:40,063
That's his sweet car
right behind him.

00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:42,799
Lucky son of a bitch.

00:28:42,866 --> 00:28:44,234
I drive an '82 Buick.

00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,269
Nick, try the unsharp mask.

00:28:58,415 --> 00:29:00,283
Yeah, that's it.
That's him.

00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,584
That's your dude.

00:29:02,986 --> 00:29:04,354
That's Tad Sidley.

00:29:04,421 --> 00:29:06,222
That was the name
on the credit card.

00:29:07,424 --> 00:29:08,525
Is this video from today?

00:29:08,591 --> 00:29:09,759
Yeah, I downloaded
it myself.

00:29:09,826 --> 00:29:12,462
Well, if that's
Tad Sidley,

00:29:12,529 --> 00:29:14,030
who's in the morgue?

00:29:14,097 --> 00:29:17,333
Hey. Thanks
for your help.
No problem.

00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,935
I laid out the photos
and sketches.

00:29:19,002 --> 00:29:20,570
Thank you.

00:29:20,637 --> 00:29:22,839
What are you looking
for exactly?

00:29:22,906 --> 00:29:24,941
When we showed up
at the scene a year ago,

00:29:25,008 --> 00:29:26,443
Sidley wouldn't let us
into his house.

00:29:26,509 --> 00:29:28,778
I'm guessing because
the body was still inside.

00:29:28,845 --> 00:29:30,914
He knew you'd
detect the smell.

00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:33,383
Kind of like <i>Telltale Heart.</i>

00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:34,551
Edgar Allan Poe.

00:29:34,617 --> 00:29:36,886
Guy commits a murder and buries
the body

00:29:36,953 --> 00:29:39,389
under the floorboards
of his house.

00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:42,492
Catherine, I got to tell you,

00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,427
I don't see anything probative.

00:29:45,462 --> 00:29:47,063
WILLOWS:
Are both these sketches

00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:48,598
drawn to the same scale?

00:29:48,665 --> 00:29:50,233
Yeah, half inch
equals a foot.

00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,402
All right...

00:29:52,469 --> 00:29:53,970
The attic is above
the living room.

00:29:54,037 --> 00:29:57,974
They both share
the same chimney.

00:29:58,041 --> 00:29:59,509
SIDLE:
Yeah?

00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:02,412
What are you thinking?

00:30:02,479 --> 00:30:07,484
The east wall of the house
is 17 feet

00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:09,753
from the chimney
in the living room.

00:30:09,819 --> 00:30:11,654
But that same east wall

00:30:11,721 --> 00:30:15,425
is only 14 feet from
the chimney in the attic.

00:30:15,492 --> 00:30:18,762
When you retrieved
the body,

00:30:18,828 --> 00:30:20,930
did you excavate
the entire chimney?

00:30:20,997 --> 00:30:22,732
No.

00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:25,135
We just removed the bricks
from the west-facing side.

00:30:27,003 --> 00:30:29,672
( <i>drill motor whirring</i> )

00:30:29,739 --> 00:30:32,709
There's no question
that somebody extended

00:30:32,776 --> 00:30:34,244
the brick exterior
of this chimney.

00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:36,946
There's a slight
color disparity

00:30:37,013 --> 00:30:38,448
between the old
and the new bricks.

00:30:49,526 --> 00:30:51,361
It's hollow.

00:30:51,428 --> 00:30:53,563
There's no clay backing.

00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:57,000
This is just a facade.

00:31:05,342 --> 00:31:08,378
Catherine...

00:31:08,445 --> 00:31:09,713
We found her.

00:31:17,387 --> 00:31:19,522
She was still bleeding
when she was brought here.

00:31:21,391 --> 00:31:24,994
Which means that her heart
was probably still beating.

00:31:25,061 --> 00:31:27,097
This isn't
<i>The Tell-Tale Heart,</i>

00:31:27,163 --> 00:31:29,699
it's <i>The Cask of Amontillado.</i>

00:31:29,766 --> 00:31:33,837
She was sealed into a wall
and left to die.

00:31:38,978 --> 00:31:42,548
( <i>siren wails</i> )

00:31:42,615 --> 00:31:45,417
CURTIS:
I just got your page.
Did he stick around?

00:31:45,484 --> 00:31:46,919
Yeah, we explained
the situation,

00:31:46,986 --> 00:31:48,521
and he thinks
it's hilarious.

00:31:48,587 --> 00:31:49,655
( <i>chuckles softly</i> )

00:31:49,722 --> 00:31:51,490
Tad, Detective Curtis.

00:31:51,557 --> 00:31:52,892
I'm glad to see you're okay.

00:31:52,958 --> 00:31:54,727
Yeah, me, too.

00:31:54,793 --> 00:31:56,695
Uh, he said you wanted
to talk to me?

00:31:56,762 --> 00:32:00,065
Yeah. Where have you been
for the past few weeks?

00:32:00,132 --> 00:32:03,335
Tijuana, L.A.,
quick stop in Santa Barbara.

00:32:03,402 --> 00:32:05,170
Just got back this morning.

00:32:05,237 --> 00:32:08,841
Any idea how your gym membership
got into a dead man's pocket?

00:32:08,908 --> 00:32:10,209
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:32:10,276 --> 00:32:13,312
No. I'm sorry,
I didn't even know
it was missing.

00:32:13,379 --> 00:32:16,015
I'm-I'm not exactly big
on the weights, you know?

00:32:16,081 --> 00:32:19,285
Look, uh...
I'm late for a movie.

00:32:19,351 --> 00:32:21,120
You mind if
I get out of here?
Sure.

00:32:21,187 --> 00:32:22,855
I'd just like to get
your cell phone number.

00:32:22,922 --> 00:32:25,524
Gonna ask me out?

00:32:25,591 --> 00:32:28,394
It's just in case I have
any further questions.

00:32:31,263 --> 00:32:33,265
ROBBINS:
Caroline did not go gently.

00:32:33,332 --> 00:32:34,567
Defensive marks?

00:32:34,633 --> 00:32:36,602
Ten on her right forearm.

00:32:36,669 --> 00:32:37,970

Oh, no! Aah!

00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:42,708
And several more
on the palms.

00:32:42,775 --> 00:32:44,743
( <i>screaming</i> )

00:32:46,378 --> 00:32:48,848
Catherine, there are tears
on her labia and hymen.

00:32:48,914 --> 00:32:51,784
Too much time's past
to check for semen.

00:32:51,851 --> 00:32:53,118
But she was raped.

00:32:53,185 --> 00:32:56,055
We found a potential blood
pool in the living room

00:32:56,121 --> 00:32:57,723
and another much more
substantial one

00:32:57,790 --> 00:33:00,226
in the attic-- is that
consistent with your findings?

00:33:00,292 --> 00:33:02,027
Yeah. Caroline was stabbed
four times,

00:33:02,094 --> 00:33:03,729
twice to the abdomen,

00:33:03,796 --> 00:33:07,299
one to the spleen,
one to the intercostal artery.

00:33:07,366 --> 00:33:08,601
No vital organs
were penetrated,

00:33:08,667 --> 00:33:10,970
which means she would have
bled to death slowly.

00:33:11,036 --> 00:33:12,738
Probably stabbed
in the living room

00:33:12,805 --> 00:33:15,474
and then moved to the attic
where she continued to bleed

00:33:15,541 --> 00:33:16,675
until she died.

00:33:16,742 --> 00:33:18,777
Is the chimney guy
still in your drawer?

00:33:18,844 --> 00:33:20,346
Yeah, right over there.

00:33:22,214 --> 00:33:23,115
What's going on?

00:33:25,284 --> 00:33:27,319
Tad Sidley is alive.

00:33:27,386 --> 00:33:29,054
We assumed that
this guy was Tad,

00:33:29,121 --> 00:33:30,322
based on a gym membership

00:33:30,389 --> 00:33:33,325
card we found on his body--
we were wrong.

00:33:33,392 --> 00:33:36,061
This guy is now a John Doe.

00:33:36,128 --> 00:33:39,632
Does his father know?
Not yet.

00:33:39,698 --> 00:33:42,234
Well, I'm on my way to P.D.
to meet up

00:33:42,301 --> 00:33:44,803
with him and his lawyer--
I'll give him the good news.

00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:46,805
McWANE:
<i>Like I've already told you,</i>

00:33:46,872 --> 00:33:49,008
Caroline and I
were <i>friends.</i>

00:33:49,074 --> 00:33:53,445
Now, if you keep this up,
I'm gonna file a harassment
charge against you, personally.

00:33:53,512 --> 00:33:55,781
Ms. Willows, on the phone
you said that you had

00:33:55,848 --> 00:33:57,249
new information
regarding my client's son?

00:33:57,316 --> 00:33:58,684
Yes, I will
get to that.

00:33:58,751 --> 00:34:01,086
But first I wanted to
let both of you know

00:34:01,153 --> 00:34:04,256
that Caroline's body was
recovered in Mr. Sidley's attic.

00:34:04,323 --> 00:34:05,424
What?

00:34:05,491 --> 00:34:07,960
The coroner confirmed
that she was raped,

00:34:08,027 --> 00:34:10,529
stabbed and bled to death.
McWANE:
Wait a minute.

00:34:10,596 --> 00:34:11,964
You searched
the house again?

00:34:12,031 --> 00:34:13,365
Ms. Willows,
I thought that

00:34:13,432 --> 00:34:14,934
the judge was
perfectly clear.

00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,368
I searched the chimney,
specifically,

00:34:16,435 --> 00:34:18,137
in accordance with
the original warrant

00:34:18,204 --> 00:34:19,438
and subsequent limitation.

00:34:19,505 --> 00:34:22,007
I didn't do it, I swear,
You live alone,

00:34:22,074 --> 00:34:23,876
Mr. Sidley...

00:34:23,943 --> 00:34:26,679
and you have no idea

00:34:26,745 --> 00:34:29,515
how her body got bricked
into your attic?

00:34:31,784 --> 00:34:33,385
( <i>quietly</i> ):
Oh, come on.

00:34:33,452 --> 00:34:34,987
What happened?

00:34:35,054 --> 00:34:36,856
Did she say no
one too many times?

00:34:36,922 --> 00:34:39,525
Ms. Willows, you are
way over the line.

00:34:39,592 --> 00:34:42,127
If you didn't kill her,
Mr. Sidley, then tell me,

00:34:42,194 --> 00:34:45,064
is there anyone else
who had access to your house?

00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:47,166
Who else could have

00:34:47,233 --> 00:34:49,668
raped Caroline under your roof?

00:34:52,738 --> 00:34:54,340
I know what happened.
Martin...

00:34:54,406 --> 00:34:55,474
No.

00:34:55,541 --> 00:34:56,976
I've been covering too long.

00:34:57,042 --> 00:35:00,079
I need to tell the truth.

00:35:02,114 --> 00:35:05,050
I was out of town,
I came home early.

00:35:05,117 --> 00:35:07,386
I heard noise
coming from the attic.

00:35:07,453 --> 00:35:09,722
<i>He told me that they'd</i>
<i>been seeing each other...</i>

00:35:09,788 --> 00:35:11,724
What's going on?
Dad...

00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:13,859
<i>...that they'd gotten</i>
<i>into a fight,</i>

00:35:13,926 --> 00:35:15,394
<i>and he raped and killed her.</i>

00:35:15,461 --> 00:35:20,399
I should have told
the police, but...

00:35:20,466 --> 00:35:23,235
she was already dead.

00:35:23,302 --> 00:35:25,471
He's my son.

00:35:25,538 --> 00:35:28,173
I wanted to
protect him.

00:35:32,077 --> 00:35:34,380
( <i>quietly</i> ):
Son of a bitch.

00:35:34,446 --> 00:35:37,383
( <i>chuckles, sniffles</i> )

00:35:38,384 --> 00:35:39,552
( <i>exhales</i> )

00:35:39,618 --> 00:35:41,086
He's lying.

00:35:41,153 --> 00:35:42,755
Do you want to tell us
what actually happened?

00:35:42,821 --> 00:35:47,193
I have no idea
what really happened.

00:35:47,259 --> 00:35:50,596
I met her once... at the house.

00:35:50,663 --> 00:35:53,532
A month or so later,
I see her on the news--

00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:54,800
she's missing.

00:35:57,836 --> 00:36:01,674
I can tell you that
for two weeks after that,

00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:04,577
he wouldn't let me
anywhere near the house.

00:36:04,643 --> 00:36:06,078
Claimed that he was painting,

00:36:06,145 --> 00:36:08,848
and he didn't want me
breathing in the fumes.

00:36:14,186 --> 00:36:16,555
He killed her.

00:36:16,622 --> 00:36:17,990
I'm sure of it.

00:36:19,291 --> 00:36:22,528
Well, if you'd like to have
a word with your old man,

00:36:22,595 --> 00:36:24,663
I'd say now would be the time.

00:36:30,502 --> 00:36:32,004
Hi, Dad.

00:36:34,206 --> 00:36:35,808
Heard everything.

00:36:35,875 --> 00:36:37,843
Tad...

00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:39,144
Son, you're...

00:36:39,211 --> 00:36:42,314
Yeah. I'm not dead.

00:36:44,383 --> 00:36:47,052
You're dead to me.

00:36:53,592 --> 00:36:54,693
( <i>phone rings</i> )

00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,695
This is Catherine.

00:36:56,762 --> 00:36:58,497
Hey, Cat,
when you're done at P.D.

00:36:58,564 --> 00:37:00,299
can you head over
to the print lab?

00:37:00,366 --> 00:37:02,234
There's something
you're gonna want to see.

00:37:02,301 --> 00:37:04,136
I'm on my way.

00:37:09,008 --> 00:37:10,476
Hi.
Hi.

00:37:10,543 --> 00:37:14,613
I know why a John Doe
was stuffed down
the Sidley's chimney.

00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:17,583
When you and Warrick
were working that
missing persons case,

00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:18,851
you couldn't get a warrant,

00:37:18,918 --> 00:37:21,187
and Martin wouldn't
let you in, right?
Right.

00:37:21,253 --> 00:37:23,122
Don Fitzgibbons tried
to gain access

00:37:23,189 --> 00:37:24,790
to the house
through the son...

00:37:24,857 --> 00:37:26,158
But the son
wouldn't cooperate.

00:37:26,225 --> 00:37:28,594
I think he knew
that if the house

00:37:28,661 --> 00:37:32,198
became a crime scene,
CSI could get in there.

00:37:33,232 --> 00:37:35,267
Well, it's a logical theory,

00:37:35,334 --> 00:37:39,038
but to kill someone and
stuff him in a chimney

00:37:39,104 --> 00:37:41,674
in hopes of getting information
on your missing daughter...

00:37:43,475 --> 00:37:45,811
( <i>typing</i> )
Check out the screen.

00:37:45,878 --> 00:37:48,147
On the left is
an unknown fingerprint

00:37:48,214 --> 00:37:50,115
I lifted off the chimney cap.

00:37:50,182 --> 00:37:52,151
On the right is a partial

00:37:52,218 --> 00:37:54,320
I lifted off of Don Fitzgibbons'

00:37:54,386 --> 00:37:56,589
post-it you took
out of Tad's dorm room.

00:37:56,655 --> 00:37:59,491
Now, the print on the post-it
is only a partial,

00:37:59,558 --> 00:38:00,926
but it's a match

00:38:00,993 --> 00:38:02,228
to the chimney cap.

00:38:02,294 --> 00:38:04,697
I also found trace evidence
on the roof.

00:38:04,763 --> 00:38:06,599
Polyethylene plastic.

00:38:06,665 --> 00:38:09,535
Don Fitzgibbons works
at Desert Palms Hospital.

00:38:09,602 --> 00:38:12,271
I just got off the phone
with the administrator.

00:38:12,338 --> 00:38:14,907
The hospital's body bags
are made out of...

00:38:14,974 --> 00:38:16,509
Polyethylene plastic?

00:38:16,575 --> 00:38:21,046
Don Fitzgibbons has access
to those body bags.

00:38:39,865 --> 00:38:41,634
It's true.

00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,636
All of it.

00:38:43,702 --> 00:38:45,504
You gonna arrest me?

00:38:45,571 --> 00:38:48,674
You just admitted to murder;
I think you know the answer.

00:38:48,741 --> 00:38:51,210
Hold on.
I didn't kill anyone.

00:38:52,244 --> 00:38:54,180
And the body in the chimney?

00:38:54,246 --> 00:38:57,483
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:38:57,550 --> 00:39:00,252
I took the body
from Desert Palm Hospital,

00:39:00,319 --> 00:39:02,021
from the morgue.

00:39:02,087 --> 00:39:04,356
He was already dead,
John Doe.

00:39:04,423 --> 00:39:05,858
Auto accident

00:39:05,925 --> 00:39:07,393
in a stolen vehicle.

00:39:07,459 --> 00:39:11,697
Car exploded, he was burned
beyond recognition.

00:39:11,764 --> 00:39:15,601
Ms. Willows, I stole a dead body
and I trespassed,

00:39:15,668 --> 00:39:17,570
but that's it.

00:39:19,071 --> 00:39:21,073
And Tad Sidley's I.D.,

00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:24,210
did you place the gym card
on the body?

00:39:24,276 --> 00:39:25,911
You're a mother, right?

00:39:26,946 --> 00:39:29,081
Yes.

00:39:30,749 --> 00:39:33,419
Why do <i>you</i> think I did it?

00:39:36,422 --> 00:39:42,761
You wanted Martin Sidley to know
what it's like to lose a child.

00:39:45,197 --> 00:39:48,267
( <i>sniffles</i> )

00:39:48,334 --> 00:39:53,138
When I was in Tad's dorm room,
I snagged it.

00:39:53,205 --> 00:39:55,608
I scorched
the surface of the car

00:39:55,674 --> 00:39:59,912
to make it look like
it belonged to the John Doe...

00:39:59,979 --> 00:40:04,750
to make Martin believe
that it was <i>his</i> son.

00:40:07,219 --> 00:40:12,124
I'd hoped that you'd be able
to restore the image.

00:40:15,361 --> 00:40:17,863
( <i>sniffles</i> ):
Look...

00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:20,866
I wish I could say
that I was sorry

00:40:20,933 --> 00:40:23,235
for the trouble
I've put you through,

00:40:23,302 --> 00:40:27,172
or the-the petty crimes
that I've committed,

00:40:27,239 --> 00:40:30,609
but I didn't hurt anyone...

00:40:30,676 --> 00:40:35,347
and Martin Sidley
is behind bars,

00:40:35,414 --> 00:40:38,951
and my daughter's
getting her funeral.

00:40:41,854 --> 00:40:44,356
And that's all I wanted.

00:40:53,098 --> 00:40:54,066
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:40:54,133 --> 00:40:56,835
<i>I'm</i> sorry.

00:40:56,902 --> 00:41:01,340
<i>I'm</i> sorry that we
couldn't find your daughter

00:41:01,407 --> 00:41:03,436
without your help.
