couldn't stop on time.

What are the options?

00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:37,757
We could try
to remove the bullet.

00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:39,458
What are the risks?

00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:42,595
If we go in, the vertebral
artery could be impacted.

00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:46,499
He could bleed out
or stroke out.

00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:49,235
Permanent incapacitation.

00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:51,003
And without surgery?

00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,605
The bullet could migrate
into the artery

00:12:52,672 --> 00:12:55,474
and, again, cause a stroke
or kill him.

00:12:55,541 --> 00:13:00,046
Or it could stay there
for years and do nothing.

00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:03,249
He might never wake up.

00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:05,885
What are the odds?

00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:08,587
Mr. Grissom,
this isn't a casino.

00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:10,556
I don't give odds.

00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:13,859
It's your call.

00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:16,228
Do it.

00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:31,310
( <i>phone line ringing</i> )

00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:32,311
ELLIE:
Hi, it's Ellie.

00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:33,312
You know the drill.

00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:34,714
( <i>beep</i> )

00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:38,284
Ellie, this is Gil Grissom
from the Las Vegas Crime Lab.

00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:40,086
I'm a friend of your father's.

00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:45,458
I'm sorry to have to tell you
this, but your dad's been shot.

00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:48,361
And his condition is serious.

00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:50,930
I think you should
come and see him.

00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:53,299
It would help him a lot.

00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:57,370
Please call me at 702-555-0141.

00:14:04,205 --> 00:14:06,508
White residue
on your vic's so-called waist

00:14:06,574 --> 00:14:09,611
was topical cortisone,
prescription strength.

00:14:09,677 --> 00:14:10,678
The guy had
an itch.

00:14:10,745 --> 00:14:12,413
He was doing
more than scratching.

00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,883
Topical doesn't get absorbed
into the bloodstream.

00:14:14,949 --> 00:14:16,351
But Henry says
that the guy's blood

00:14:16,417 --> 00:14:18,219
was flooded with cortisone.

00:14:18,286 --> 00:14:19,521
That makes sense,

00:14:19,587 --> 00:14:22,657
as much orthopedic pain
as the guy was in.

00:14:24,659 --> 00:14:27,495
You checking out my waist?

00:14:27,562 --> 00:14:29,330
I'm a 32-incher myself.

00:14:29,397 --> 00:14:30,632
Same as in college.
Oh.

00:14:30,698 --> 00:14:32,600
Congratulations.

00:14:32,667 --> 00:14:34,002
Women aren't the only ones

00:14:34,068 --> 00:14:35,737
who feel the pressure
to look good.

00:14:35,804 --> 00:14:37,672
Time was, having a rotund belly

00:14:37,739 --> 00:14:39,841
was a sign of
prosperity and success.

00:14:39,908 --> 00:14:42,343
Now it just means you're
a lazy glutton, not getting any.

00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:43,912
Fibers.

00:14:43,978 --> 00:14:48,216
The fibers from the
victim's long johns

00:14:48,283 --> 00:14:51,319
are consistent with the fibers
found in the burned-up clothes.

00:14:51,386 --> 00:14:53,321
STOKES:
Means those were
the clothes he was wearing.

00:14:53,388 --> 00:14:55,356
Raw wool, dyed grey.

00:14:55,423 --> 00:14:56,491
Did you get a manufacturer?

00:14:56,558 --> 00:14:57,926
No one from
my database.

00:14:57,992 --> 00:15:00,795
But I did find
pomegranate berry extract,

00:15:00,862 --> 00:15:03,331
used to turn wool
dye in the 1800s.

00:15:03,398 --> 00:15:05,967
STOKES:
Insect activity
all over these fibers.

00:15:06,034 --> 00:15:07,936
Maybe moths or mites.

00:15:08,002 --> 00:15:09,003
Check it out.

00:15:10,939 --> 00:15:12,707
HODGES:
Means that the fabric was old.

00:15:14,709 --> 00:15:16,544
Vintage clothing, maybe?

00:15:16,611 --> 00:15:18,179
Maybe.

00:15:18,246 --> 00:15:19,981
Did you analyze
the bone fragments?

00:15:20,048 --> 00:15:21,716
I'm only one
highly-gifted person.

00:15:21,783 --> 00:15:22,750
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:15:22,817 --> 00:15:23,818
I'll let you know.

00:15:23,885 --> 00:15:25,920
You been to the hospital?

00:15:25,987 --> 00:15:28,556
They're prepping
him for surgery.

00:15:28,623 --> 00:15:31,626
I'll keep good thoughts.

00:15:31,693 --> 00:15:33,061
Mr. Party Till I Drop.

00:15:33,128 --> 00:15:35,463
His blood alcohol level
was .28.

00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:36,965
Point two-eight?!

00:15:37,031 --> 00:15:38,867
That's barely conscious
for most people.

00:15:38,933 --> 00:15:40,568
That's like falling-down drunk.

00:15:40,635 --> 00:15:42,137
Drunk just gets you
in the door.

00:15:42,203 --> 00:15:44,172
We're also talking cocaine,

00:15:44,239 --> 00:15:46,407
opiates, barbiturates,
methamphetamine,

00:15:46,474 --> 00:15:47,909
MDMA, THC.

00:15:47,976 --> 00:15:51,146
Serum was milky white
with triglycerides.

00:15:51,212 --> 00:15:52,447
Wow.

00:15:52,514 --> 00:15:55,884
If it was illegal, fun or nasty,
this guy was into it.

00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:56,885
Yeah, I'll say.

00:15:56,951 --> 00:15:58,453
I just analyzed
the secretion swabs

00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,888
you collected from his body.

00:15:59,954 --> 00:16:01,356
Was there enough for DNA?

00:16:01,422 --> 00:16:03,258
Oh, yeah.
The donor's female.

00:16:03,324 --> 00:16:05,160
She's consistent with both
the blood from the mirror

00:16:05,226 --> 00:16:06,961
and the pubic hair
from the victim's mouth.

00:16:07,028 --> 00:16:09,364
And then I ran
the profile through CODIS,

00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:11,232
and you got really lucky.

00:16:11,299 --> 00:16:12,600
She's a local prostitute.

00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:13,668
She's in the system

00:16:13,735 --> 00:16:16,271
for a trick roll.

00:16:16,337 --> 00:16:18,640
ROBBINS:
There's evidence of sexual
activity in every orifice,

00:16:18,706 --> 00:16:20,475
including his ears.

00:16:20,542 --> 00:16:21,643
WILLOWS:
You joking?

00:16:21,709 --> 00:16:22,911
No.

00:16:22,977 --> 00:16:26,414
We've got pubic hairs,
vaginal secretions.

00:16:26,481 --> 00:16:28,349
Maybe he suffocated
during oral sex.

00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:30,952
Would you care to move on
to stomach contents?

00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:32,754
Guess we're done
with the appetizers.

00:16:32,821 --> 00:16:33,888
Well, the main
course was

00:16:33,955 --> 00:16:36,324
enough alcohol and cake
to cater a wedding.

00:16:36,391 --> 00:16:39,627
Well, at least
he went out in style, hmm?

00:16:48,169 --> 00:16:50,405
ROBBINS:
Alone, maybe none of it

00:16:50,472 --> 00:16:52,273
would've been fatal, but
taken all together...

00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,709
Means he died with
a smile on his face.

00:16:54,776 --> 00:16:56,511
Among other things.
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:16:56,578 --> 00:16:58,146
( <i>door opens</i> )

00:16:58,213 --> 00:17:00,048
Hey.

00:17:00,114 --> 00:17:01,349
Just came from the hospital.

00:17:04,853 --> 00:17:06,387
Oh.

00:17:06,454 --> 00:17:07,755
No, no.
Traffic fatality.

00:17:07,822 --> 00:17:09,123
Sorry.

00:17:11,159 --> 00:17:14,162
( <i>woman speaking over intercom</i> )

00:17:19,834 --> 00:17:21,503
GRISSOM:
Where's McKeen?

00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:23,104
I sent him home.

00:17:24,706 --> 00:17:26,574
Just kidding. He went
to get something to eat.

00:17:28,343 --> 00:17:30,678
Brass just went into surgery.

00:17:34,983 --> 00:17:37,285
You two have known each
other for a long time.

00:17:39,154 --> 00:17:41,523
We've worked together ever since
he came from New Jersey.

00:17:41,589 --> 00:17:44,125
Just between you and me,

00:17:44,192 --> 00:17:45,527
does he always wear a suit?

00:17:45,593 --> 00:17:47,962
Like when you guys
go to dinner,

00:17:48,029 --> 00:17:50,632
the movies or whatever it is
you do when you hang out.

00:17:50,698 --> 00:17:52,567
'Cause I got
to tell you,

00:17:52,634 --> 00:17:56,237
thought of him in a sweater
kind of freaks me out.

00:17:58,273 --> 00:18:01,709
We don't "hang out," Greg.

00:18:01,776 --> 00:18:04,012
No kidding.

00:18:04,078 --> 00:18:05,513
I just assumed...

00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,148
ELLIE:
What do you mean
consent was given?

00:18:07,215 --> 00:18:09,184
Nobody has asked my consent
to do anything,

00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,318
and I'm his daughter.

00:18:10,385 --> 00:18:12,086
NURSE:
I understand
you're upset, miss,

00:18:12,153 --> 00:18:13,721
but there's no need
to take that tone.

00:18:13,788 --> 00:18:15,790
ELLIE:
Look, I'm just here to
see my father, okay?

00:18:15,857 --> 00:18:17,158
He's a cop.

00:18:17,225 --> 00:18:18,293
He's in surgery.

00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:19,928
The only thing
you can do right now

00:18:19,994 --> 00:18:22,363
is take a seat
and wait until he gets out.

00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:24,265
Excuse me, Ellie?
What?

00:18:24,332 --> 00:18:25,633
I'm Gil Grissom.

00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,868
Thanks for coming.

00:18:26,935 --> 00:18:29,971
So I guess you're the
one who's in charge.

00:18:31,206 --> 00:18:32,974
How long is his
surgery going to take?

00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:34,709
Probably a few hours.

00:18:36,544 --> 00:18:38,746
Look, I just got off a
bus, I would really like

00:18:38,813 --> 00:18:41,216
to take a shower and change
and maybe get a little rest.

00:18:41,282 --> 00:18:42,717
Do you have the
keys to his house?

00:18:42,784 --> 00:18:44,819
No.

00:18:44,886 --> 00:18:47,088
Well, you're a cop, right?
How 'bout you just let me in?

00:18:49,123 --> 00:18:51,326
You know, there's a motel
just down the street.

00:18:51,392 --> 00:18:52,627
I'll get you a room.

00:18:52,694 --> 00:18:54,863
Do you want to
check my arms?

00:18:54,929 --> 00:18:56,064
Go ahead.

00:18:56,131 --> 00:18:57,765
All right? It looks like
Daddy already told you

00:18:57,832 --> 00:18:59,000
all about me.

00:18:59,067 --> 00:19:01,436
I don't even know why
I bothered to come.

00:19:11,379 --> 00:19:12,614
How's it going?

00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,615
You okay?

00:19:13,681 --> 00:19:15,450
I'm okay.

00:19:17,018 --> 00:19:19,721
That's a...
man in a corset.

00:19:19,787 --> 00:19:21,689
Corset-training.

00:19:21,756 --> 00:19:23,057
A venerable practice.

00:19:23,124 --> 00:19:25,059
Maybe for Scarlett O'Hara.

00:19:25,126 --> 00:19:26,561
Since when was it
equal opportunity?

00:19:26,628 --> 00:19:28,563
In Victorian times,
it was considered

00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:30,298
a staple of masculine attire.

00:19:30,365 --> 00:19:32,233
Students in British
boarding schools

00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:35,870
were encouraged to lose
an inch a year

00:19:35,937 --> 00:19:37,438
from the time they were 14 on.

00:19:37,505 --> 00:19:41,242
I guess I should feel comforted
that sadistic ideas of beauty

00:19:41,309 --> 00:19:42,610
aren't restricted to women.

00:19:42,677 --> 00:19:44,412
Mm.

00:19:44,479 --> 00:19:48,082
It's called a wasp-waist,
which is revealing.

00:19:48,149 --> 00:19:50,718
A wasp is from
the insect group

00:19:50,785 --> 00:19:52,520
hymenoptera.

00:19:52,587 --> 00:19:55,089
The notion of hymen
indicates virginity.

00:19:55,156 --> 00:19:58,460
In predacious wasps, the
genitalia no longer functions

00:19:58,526 --> 00:20:00,028
as a reproductive organ.

00:20:00,094 --> 00:20:01,496
It's used as a stinger.

00:20:01,563 --> 00:20:04,432
Go in for sex and get stung.

00:20:04,499 --> 00:20:06,901
Pretty much every man's fear.

00:20:06,968 --> 00:20:08,603
Mm.

00:20:10,371 --> 00:20:13,508
The victim was shot,

00:20:13,575 --> 00:20:15,443
body dumped, clothes burned.

00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:17,412
The corset, too.

00:20:17,479 --> 00:20:18,847
The bone fragments
that Nick found

00:20:18,913 --> 00:20:20,315
at the crime scene
were whalebone,

00:20:20,381 --> 00:20:22,951
which is what they used
to make corsets out of.

00:20:23,017 --> 00:20:25,286
Where did you learn
so much about corsets?

00:20:25,353 --> 00:20:27,989
I have my sources.

00:20:35,497 --> 00:20:38,032
MAN:
The embroidery is Chinese, silk.

00:20:38,099 --> 00:20:42,237
The lace is made
from hand-tatted linen thread.

00:20:42,303 --> 00:20:44,472
Ribs are pure whalebone.

00:20:44,539 --> 00:20:46,207
They don't make them
like this anymore.

00:20:47,609 --> 00:20:49,043
I'm sure the whales
appreciate that.

00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,778
How many, if any,

00:20:50,845 --> 00:20:52,046
do you sell to men?

00:20:52,113 --> 00:20:53,681
More than you'd think.

00:20:53,748 --> 00:20:57,385
Many men with back problems
have remarked how much better

00:20:57,452 --> 00:20:59,687
a boned-tabbed
Elizabethan corset feels

00:20:59,754 --> 00:21:02,157
than a steel back brace.

00:21:02,223 --> 00:21:03,791
Oh.

00:21:03,858 --> 00:21:06,628
Let's focus on your customers
that don't have back problems.

00:21:06,694 --> 00:21:09,697
Ms. Sidle, people's private
lives are their own business.

00:21:09,764 --> 00:21:10,965
I don't want to...

00:21:11,032 --> 00:21:13,601
Mr. Phillipe, I have a dead man
with a 19-inch waist

00:21:13,668 --> 00:21:14,903
and no way to identify him.

00:21:14,969 --> 00:21:17,472
Any help at all
would be appreciated.

00:21:17,539 --> 00:21:18,706
Do you have a picture?

00:21:18,773 --> 00:21:20,275
I have a head shot.

00:21:27,749 --> 00:21:29,684
( <i>hyperventilating</i> )

00:21:29,751 --> 00:21:31,486
Oh, my God, that's, uh,

00:21:31,553 --> 00:21:32,487
that's Caleb Carson.

00:21:32,554 --> 00:21:33,888
He comes in

00:21:33,955 --> 00:21:36,624
once a year for a re-stitch
and reinforcement.

00:21:36,691 --> 00:21:40,395
Is he into pain, masochism?

00:21:40,462 --> 00:21:42,063
I don't know.

00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:43,765
How about cross-dressing?

00:21:43,832 --> 00:21:46,067
I seriously doubt that.

00:21:46,134 --> 00:21:47,068
How come?

00:21:47,135 --> 00:21:49,904
Mr. Carson never spoke much,

00:21:49,971 --> 00:21:53,641
but he was the type of man who,
when he came into the store,

00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:56,911
if I were sitting down,
I'd immediately stand up.

00:21:56,978 --> 00:21:58,813
He treated me
like a servant.

00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,848
And, truth be told,

00:21:59,914 --> 00:22:02,851
he actually made me
feel like one.

00:22:02,917 --> 00:22:06,588
I'm going to need his address.

00:22:24,606 --> 00:22:26,808
Colonel Caleb
"C.C." Carson.

They didn't

00:22:40,221 --> 00:22:42,023
smile much back then.

00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:45,627
Subjects had to hold completely
still for five minutes.

00:22:45,693 --> 00:22:47,228
Otherwise, the
exposure would blur.

00:22:47,295 --> 00:22:49,164
It hurt to
hold a smile.

00:22:50,198 --> 00:22:52,167
Bet these hurt more.

00:22:56,805 --> 00:22:59,908
It's the same caliber
killed the vic.

00:22:59,974 --> 00:23:01,976

My dad was.

00:23:54,982 --> 00:23:58,019
Used to spend the summer
touring Pennsylvania in an RV,

Pickett's Charge, I think.

The Confederates advanced

00:24:07,762 --> 00:24:10,097
from this position
to Cemetery Ridge.

00:24:10,164 --> 00:24:12,600
They marched to their doom,

but kept their honor.

00:24:14,568 --> 00:24:16,837
Carson obviously

00:24:16,904 --> 00:24:18,739
was a Son of the South.

00:24:25,846 --> 00:24:27,682
Looks comfortable.

Oh, I don't
really know. I...

00:25:05,052 --> 00:25:06,153
You know what?

00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,455
Let me call you back.

00:25:07,521 --> 00:25:08,789
Ellie?

00:25:09,824 --> 00:25:12,059
Hey.

00:25:12,126 --> 00:25:13,594
You know your father's
out of surgery.

00:25:13,661 --> 00:25:14,895
Yeah. How's he doing?

00:25:14,962 --> 00:25:17,465
It's a little too early
to tell, but I know

00:25:17,531 --> 00:25:19,767
when he wakes up,
he'll be happy to see you.

00:25:19,834 --> 00:25:21,402
You think so?

00:25:21,469 --> 00:25:23,070
I know so. You look good.

00:25:23,137 --> 00:25:26,240
Yeah, you mean, I don't look
like a crack whore anymore?

00:25:26,307 --> 00:25:28,476
That's not what I meant, but no.

00:25:30,611 --> 00:25:33,848
Does he ever talk about me?

00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:37,718
That's a no.

00:25:37,785 --> 00:25:38,986
Look,

00:25:39,053 --> 00:25:40,755
what do you want me to say, hmm?

00:25:40,821 --> 00:25:43,491
It's not really about
you right now, okay?

00:25:43,557 --> 00:25:46,727
But the fact that you're here
is saying a lot.

00:25:48,262 --> 00:25:51,132
Yeah, well, thanks
for clearing that up for me.

00:25:58,005 --> 00:26:01,609
Remember that trick roll
that you pled out last year?

00:26:01,676 --> 00:26:03,611
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

00:26:03,678 --> 00:26:06,180
Your DNA in our database says
that you do.

00:26:06,247 --> 00:26:09,216
We found your blood
in Manny Rupert's apartment,

00:26:09,283 --> 00:26:10,985
with him lying there dead.

00:26:12,787 --> 00:26:14,922
If you Belushi'd the guy,

00:26:14,989 --> 00:26:16,957
maybe you didn't mean to.

00:26:17,024 --> 00:26:19,126
Now would be the time to say it.

00:26:19,193 --> 00:26:20,961
Look, I'm the victim here.

00:26:21,028 --> 00:26:22,897
Funny, you don't look dead.

00:26:22,963 --> 00:26:25,132
( <i>heavy sigh</i> )

00:26:25,199 --> 00:26:27,468
Look, the whole night
started out normal, okay?

00:26:27,535 --> 00:26:29,203
I mean, he paid for everything.

00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:30,805
He was kind of fun.

00:26:30,871 --> 00:26:33,140
( <i>cork popping</i> )
<i>And he was up for anything.</i>

00:26:33,207 --> 00:26:36,310

00:26:36,377 --> 00:26:39,580
<i>And he wasn't even</i>
<i>bad-looking.</i>

00:26:39,647 --> 00:26:42,183
So, how did it go so bad?

00:26:42,249 --> 00:26:45,453
Well, usually, a guy is good
for maybe one or two.

00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:48,723
This guy wanted more after six,
if you know what I mean.

00:26:48,789 --> 00:26:52,760
No "off" switch?
No, not even close.

00:26:52,827 --> 00:26:55,429
It's getting kind of late.
No, look, you're not...
you're not going anywhere!

00:26:55,496 --> 00:26:57,064
Okay, honey, you need
to get some rest.

00:26:57,131 --> 00:26:59,033
No. I paid
for the whole night!

00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,868
( <i>gunshots, screaming</i> )

00:27:00,935 --> 00:27:02,536
Son of a... Ow. Ouch. Ow.

00:27:02,603 --> 00:27:05,439
He was whacked out,
but he was alive when I bolted.

00:27:05,506 --> 00:27:06,607
Well, that's a

00:27:06,674 --> 00:27:08,142
great story,
but it doesn't sound

00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:11,445
like it was worth the ten G's
that we found in your purse.

00:27:11,512 --> 00:27:12,947
I earned that money.

00:27:13,014 --> 00:27:15,016
Don't take it personally,

00:27:15,082 --> 00:27:17,952
but you are not
a $10,000-a-night girl.

00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,389
Are you finished processing
those prints

00:27:21,455 --> 00:27:23,124
from Manny Rupert's
apartment?

00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:24,725
Does it look like I have?

00:27:24,792 --> 00:27:26,560
So far, the decedent's prints
are everywhere.

00:27:26,627 --> 00:27:30,531
Got them on liquor bottles,
drug paraphernalia, the gun,

00:27:30,598 --> 00:27:31,866
the dishes.

00:27:31,932 --> 00:27:33,834
Are you looking for something
in particular?

00:27:33,901 --> 00:27:36,270
We're looking for
anything the hooker
might have touched.

00:27:36,337 --> 00:27:38,439
We're thinking she might
have slipped him something

00:27:38,506 --> 00:27:40,341
that pushed him
over the edge.

00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:41,742
Uh...

00:27:41,809 --> 00:27:43,544
I got her prints
off of the bedpost,

00:27:43,611 --> 00:27:44,912
the chair, and a soda can.

00:27:44,979 --> 00:27:47,348
She didn't touch the booze
or pills.

00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:49,450
Maybe she's in AA.

00:27:49,517 --> 00:27:50,751
Hmm.

00:27:50,818 --> 00:27:53,654
Maybe she's
not a killer.

00:27:53,721 --> 00:27:56,791
I just can't believe it.

00:27:56,857 --> 00:28:00,661
I've been with Mr. Carson
for years.

00:28:00,728 --> 00:28:02,663
How do you mean?

00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:03,898
Nothing like that.

00:28:03,964 --> 00:28:05,566
I was his driver.

00:28:05,633 --> 00:28:08,469
I take it you got my
fingerprints from my work card?

00:28:08,536 --> 00:28:09,937
That's right.

00:28:10,004 --> 00:28:12,740
They were on one
of Mr. Carson's corsets.

00:28:12,807 --> 00:28:15,076
I was also Mr. Carson's dresser.

00:28:15,142 --> 00:28:16,811
What did that entail?

00:28:16,877 --> 00:28:18,512
In the 19th century,

00:28:18,579 --> 00:28:21,015
a dresser's job was
to help gentleman soldiers

00:28:21,082 --> 00:28:22,416
with their equipment.

00:28:22,483 --> 00:28:25,786
So you dressed him
in Rebel drag.

00:28:25,853 --> 00:28:28,389
If you're asking,
did I lace his corset,

00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:30,624
of course.

00:28:30,691 --> 00:28:32,927
Every morning.

00:28:32,994 --> 00:28:34,328
Did it hurt?

00:28:34,395 --> 00:28:36,163
Absolutely.

00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:38,432
But he controlled the pain.

00:28:38,499 --> 00:28:42,269
When was the last time
you saw him?

00:28:42,336 --> 00:28:44,138
Yesterday morning.

00:28:44,205 --> 00:28:45,406
At the house.

00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:46,474
No.

00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:49,276
At a duel.

00:28:49,343 --> 00:28:51,045
A duel?

00:28:51,112 --> 00:28:52,380
Where?

00:28:52,446 --> 00:28:55,049
Gettysburg.

00:28:58,285 --> 00:29:00,321
( <i>gunfire</i> )

00:29:00,388 --> 00:29:02,023

If all you do
is Civil War recreations,

why were you
and Caleb Carson having a duel?

00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:21,108
Ugh! Apparently,
I offended him.

00:29:21,175 --> 00:29:24,545
Honey, I'm right in the
middle of Cemetery Ridge here.

00:29:24,612 --> 00:29:26,380
I care what
we have for dinner.

00:29:26,447 --> 00:29:27,715
Well, check the cupboards...

00:29:27,782 --> 00:29:28,916
Sir!
( <i>grunts</i> )

00:29:28,983 --> 00:29:30,151
You dishonor
the dead.

00:29:30,217 --> 00:29:33,020
Damn it, Caleb, that was my wife
I was talking to.

00:29:33,087 --> 00:29:34,855
My great-great
grandfather spilled blood

00:29:34,922 --> 00:29:36,123
on this hallowed ground.

00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:37,224
Oh, really?

00:29:37,291 --> 00:29:39,894
I didn't know
Gettysburg was in Nevada.

00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,762
I demand satisfaction.

00:29:42,963 --> 00:29:45,433
I challenge you to a duel, sir!

00:29:45,499 --> 00:29:47,768
( <i>heavy sigh</i> )

00:29:48,969 --> 00:29:51,105
Okay. Fine.

00:29:51,172 --> 00:29:52,940
Let's do it.

00:29:53,007 --> 00:29:54,909
I'd never reenacted a duel,
so, uh,

00:29:54,975 --> 00:29:58,045
we agreed to meet on the field
of honor with our pistols.

00:29:58,112 --> 00:29:59,313
And real bullets?

00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,881
No, no, not
in my gun.

00:30:00,948 --> 00:30:03,751
No, I figured we were just going
to blast some powder

00:30:03,818 --> 00:30:05,486
and then go out for pancakes.

00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:08,356
Caleb wanted
a little more authenticity.

00:30:08,422 --> 00:30:10,224
Guns at the ready and...

00:30:10,291 --> 00:30:11,459
one, two,

00:30:11,525 --> 00:30:13,194
three, four, five,

00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,062
six, seven, eight,

00:30:15,129 --> 00:30:17,965
nine, ten.

00:30:18,032 --> 00:30:19,233
( <i>screams</i> )

00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,501
( <i>men shouting</i>
<i>in distance</i> )

00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:22,603
But this isn't a recreation,
you know.

00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:23,971
He really shot me.

00:30:24,038 --> 00:30:25,239
Almost nicked the bone.

00:30:25,306 --> 00:30:27,408
It's a good thing
my second was there.

00:30:28,809 --> 00:30:30,244
He's a male nurse.

00:30:31,779 --> 00:30:32,880
CURTIS:
A man

00:30:32,947 --> 00:30:36,951
shoots you,
and you don't call the police?

00:30:37,018 --> 00:30:39,320
He shot me 'cause
I was taking a cell phone call.

00:30:39,387 --> 00:30:42,390
What do you think he was going
to do if went to the cops?

00:30:42,456 --> 00:30:44,291
When that
bullet hit me,

00:30:44,358 --> 00:30:45,459
I ran for my life.

00:30:45,526 --> 00:30:47,662
I jumped in my car
and got the heck out of here.

00:30:47,728 --> 00:30:49,296
What about him?

00:30:49,363 --> 00:30:51,999
Oh, we-we carpool.

00:30:53,034 --> 00:30:55,002
Colt .44?

00:30:55,069 --> 00:30:57,238
Yeah.

00:30:57,304 --> 00:30:58,873
Is that your dueling pistol?

00:31:00,074 --> 00:31:01,676
We're going to have
to take that with us.

00:31:01,742 --> 00:31:03,277
Why?

00:31:03,344 --> 00:31:06,847
I, too, demand satisfaction.

00:31:06,914 --> 00:31:08,049
( <i>men shouting</i> )

00:31:12,198 --> 00:31:13,767
Ready?

00:31:13,833 --> 00:31:15,468
Ready.

00:31:15,535 --> 00:31:18,438
BOTH:
One, two, three,

00:31:18,505 --> 00:31:21,441
four, five, six,

00:31:21,508 --> 00:31:22,976
seven, eight,

00:31:23,042 --> 00:31:24,477
nine, ten.

00:31:24,544 --> 00:31:28,114
( <i>camera shutters clicking</i> )

00:31:32,281 --> 00:31:33,816
I got blood drops.

00:31:33,883 --> 00:31:35,852
Heading way from Mr. Carson.

00:31:35,918 --> 00:31:38,020
Consistent
with the duelist's story.

00:31:38,087 --> 00:31:39,689
( <i>screams</i> )

00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:44,160
( <i>camera shutter clicking</i> )

00:31:44,227 --> 00:31:46,829
I got something here, too.

00:31:46,896 --> 00:31:49,632
This could be the blood
that we didn't find

00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:51,834
at the train tracks--
It's a lot of blood.

00:31:51,901 --> 00:31:53,536
( <i>camera shutter clicking</i> )

00:31:53,603 --> 00:31:54,904
Maybe Carson was killed here.

00:32:02,044 --> 00:32:04,180
( <i>muffled voices on intercom</i> )

00:32:07,016 --> 00:32:08,584
Yeah, she's here.

00:32:08,651 --> 00:32:10,353
Been drinking a ton of coffee

00:32:10,419 --> 00:32:12,955
and going outside for smokes;
on her cell.

00:32:13,022 --> 00:32:15,458
Not real sociable, you know?

00:32:15,525 --> 00:32:17,727
You want me
to keep an eye on her?

00:32:17,793 --> 00:32:19,529
GRISSOM:
It sounds like you already are.

00:32:19,595 --> 00:32:21,164
Nah. I'm off the clock.

00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,765
I'll stick around
for awhile,

00:32:22,832 --> 00:32:24,867
let you know
if there's any change.

00:32:24,934 --> 00:32:26,402
Thank you, Nick.

00:32:26,469 --> 00:32:28,404
Did you compare the bullet
from the victim

00:32:28,471 --> 00:32:29,605
to this pistol?

00:32:29,672 --> 00:32:31,174
Uh, no, not yet,
but, boss,

00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,009
I don't think
that's your murder weapon.

00:32:33,075 --> 00:32:35,044
And you know this how?

00:32:35,111 --> 00:32:37,313
Uh, here,
I'll let Hawkeye show you.

00:32:45,121 --> 00:32:46,289
What is that?

00:32:46,355 --> 00:32:48,124
DAWSON:
Well, Hodges will
have to confirm,

00:32:48,191 --> 00:32:49,425
but I'm pretty certain

00:32:49,492 --> 00:32:51,494
it's cream of wheat.

00:32:53,095 --> 00:32:55,064
So he's a cereal killer.

00:32:55,131 --> 00:32:57,366
Snap, crackle and pop.

00:32:57,433 --> 00:32:59,936
Uh, the dried powdered
wheat particles actually

00:33:00,002 --> 00:33:02,572
augments the smoke, and, uh,

00:33:02,638 --> 00:33:05,441
seals the gunpowder
in the cylinder.

00:33:05,508 --> 00:33:08,544
Which would be perfect
for Civil War reenactments.

00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:10,112
Yeah. I don't think

00:33:10,179 --> 00:33:15,184
that Colt's fired
a real bullet in quite a while.

00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:23,926
BROWN:
<i>Miss Rupert,</i>
<i>as far as we can tell,</i>

00:33:23,993 --> 00:33:26,128
<i>your brother died</i>
<i>from diabetic shock.</i>

00:33:26,195 --> 00:33:28,731
What? How?

00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:30,566
Well, it seems
that he went

00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:31,868
on a bender.

00:33:31,934 --> 00:33:35,171
He consumed
a great deal of alcohol, sugar

00:33:35,238 --> 00:33:36,472
and narcotics.

00:33:36,539 --> 00:33:38,841
Did he party
like this a lot?

00:33:38,908 --> 00:33:40,843
No. No.

00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:43,112
He was just diagnosed
as pre-diabetic.

00:33:43,179 --> 00:33:46,616
So he was aware
of his condition.

00:33:46,682 --> 00:33:48,818
Yeah.

00:33:48,885 --> 00:33:51,287
Do you like that
this was self-induced?

00:33:51,354 --> 00:33:53,122
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:33:53,189 --> 00:33:55,024
You know,
our family has a history

00:33:55,091 --> 00:33:56,993
of heart disease and diabetes.

00:33:57,059 --> 00:33:59,996
Both our parents died of
heart attacks in their 40s.

00:34:00,062 --> 00:34:01,864
Two of our
grandparents, too.

00:34:01,931 --> 00:34:03,533
Well, Manny turned 40 last week

00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:05,835
and he acted
like it was a death sentence.

00:34:05,902 --> 00:34:08,104
You know, but he...
he always said,

00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:10,206
"You can't fight bad genes."

00:34:10,273 --> 00:34:13,676
You know, he had a vasectomy
when he was 22.

00:34:13,743 --> 00:34:17,713
Never got married,
just didn't see the point.

00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,715
So he just... gave up?

00:34:19,782 --> 00:34:21,717
He quit?

00:34:21,784 --> 00:34:24,153
You don't know what it's like

00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:26,856
to live with a death sentence
hanging over your head.

00:34:26,923 --> 00:34:30,993
No. You're right, I don't.

00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,995
No.

00:34:33,062 --> 00:34:35,798
But I've seen what it's like
to not have a choice.

00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:37,500
And he did.

00:34:37,567 --> 00:34:40,536
He could have fought it,
but he just chose not to.

00:34:40,603 --> 00:34:44,707
You know, I just lost my
brother, and you're judging him?

00:34:44,774 --> 00:34:48,144
How dare you.

00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:51,614
I'm-I'm so very
sorry for your loss.

00:35:02,358 --> 00:35:04,494
Am I interrupting?

00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,529
No.

00:35:06,596 --> 00:35:09,999
I just got a heads up from
a friend in payroll at PERS.

00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:13,269
Ellie Brass just called
about Jim's pension.

00:35:13,336 --> 00:35:15,671
She wanted to know
how much there was

00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:17,540
and was she
a beneficiary.

00:35:17,607 --> 00:35:20,109
This girl is circling
like a vulture.

00:35:20,176 --> 00:35:24,213
Jim doesn't need this kind
of energy around him now.

00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:27,617
Now...
Ellie's been in

00:35:27,683 --> 00:35:29,652
a lot of trouble with the law.

00:35:29,719 --> 00:35:32,688
It wouldn't be difficult
to chase her out of town.

00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:36,425
Well, I'm sure
he'd appreciate the offer,

00:35:36,492 --> 00:35:39,128
but I don't think
he'd want you to do that.

00:35:39,195 --> 00:35:41,697
Excuse me.

00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:43,432
I got the DNA results

00:35:43,499 --> 00:35:45,535
for your decapitated

00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:46,903
Civil War corset victim,

00:35:46,969 --> 00:35:49,438
and the blood from the field
is a match to Carson,

00:35:49,505 --> 00:35:50,806
but the epithelials
on the toupee

00:35:50,873 --> 00:35:52,441
from the train tracks
are not.

00:35:52,508 --> 00:35:55,311
So, were any of your suspects
wearing a rug?

00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:59,482
I can think of one.

00:35:59,549 --> 00:36:02,285
Please be careful.

00:36:02,351 --> 00:36:03,753
That's a very expensive piece.

00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:06,589
I don't understand
why I'm here again.

00:36:06,656 --> 00:36:08,758
It's not a crime
to lose your hair.

00:36:08,825 --> 00:36:11,127
Depends on where you lose it.

00:36:11,194 --> 00:36:12,895
SIDLE:
If it's on
the train tracks

00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:15,498
near a decapitated body
with the victim's blood on it,

00:36:15,565 --> 00:36:17,400
it's usually a crime.

00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:19,435
Mr. Kimble,

00:36:19,502 --> 00:36:21,737
would you like to revise
your prior statement?

00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:24,307
Or would you prefer
to wait in a cell

00:36:24,373 --> 00:36:25,608
while we match toupees?

00:36:28,578 --> 00:36:31,614
It was an accident.

00:36:31,681 --> 00:36:33,115
Which part?

00:36:33,182 --> 00:36:36,185
I suppose mostly the part
when I shot him.

00:36:38,054 --> 00:36:40,423
I could see
the insanity in his eyes.

00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:43,192
( <i>gunfire, yelling</i> )

00:36:43,259 --> 00:36:45,094
Mr. Carson, you shot him!

00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:47,830
You really shot him!
And I intend to kill him.

00:36:47,897 --> 00:36:49,432
Get out of my way!

00:36:49,499 --> 00:36:50,700
KIMBLE:
Please!

00:36:50,766 --> 00:36:52,034
( <i>gunshot</i> )

00:36:54,537 --> 00:36:58,841
He was really going
to kill that man.

00:36:58,908 --> 00:37:01,310
If it was an accident,
you should have called 911.

00:37:01,377 --> 00:37:04,013
I couldn't let him
be found like that.

00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:07,416
His corseting was private.

00:37:07,483 --> 00:37:09,285
You're right,
it's much better

00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:12,455
to have his body found stripped
and dumped on some train tracks.

00:37:12,522 --> 00:37:14,724
His great-great-great
grandfather died trying to stop

00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:17,126
a Yankee train
from entering Virginia.

00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:19,529
Legend has it he stood
square on the tracks

00:37:19,595 --> 00:37:22,899
firing at the engineer
until the train ran him down.

00:37:22,965 --> 00:37:26,135
Mr. Carson spoke
of it frequently.

00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:28,938
He said it was
an honorable death.

00:37:30,606 --> 00:37:35,545
I was just trying
to give him the same.

00:37:35,611 --> 00:37:38,481
All right, look, are you
guys arresting me or what?

00:37:38,548 --> 00:37:40,216
Hey, don't get in my face.

00:37:40,283 --> 00:37:42,785
All he told me
was bring you here.

00:37:44,554 --> 00:37:47,957
Hi. Come in.

00:37:54,497 --> 00:37:56,098
This is your dad's office.

00:37:56,165 --> 00:37:58,100
Yeah, I can read.

00:37:58,167 --> 00:38:01,337
Have a seat.

00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:03,272
Why?

00:38:03,339 --> 00:38:06,242
Why not?

00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:31,234
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:38:40,176 --> 00:38:42,578
That's the reason
we asked you to come in.

00:38:42,645 --> 00:38:46,616
That's like loving a puppy.
That's easy.

00:38:46,682 --> 00:38:49,452
You know,
did you ever think

00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:52,155
that maybe he's better off
just lying there

00:38:52,221 --> 00:38:54,657
and not waking up?

00:38:54,724 --> 00:38:56,959
A lot easier.

00:38:57,026 --> 00:38:59,729
DOCTOR:
<i>Every patient is different,</i>

00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:02,098
but for now,
no change is good news.

( <i>cell phone ringing</i> )

00:39:04,066 --> 00:39:06,235
Excuse me.

00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:08,671
Hi, Lindsey.

00:39:08,738 --> 00:39:13,242
I know, I told you that
I might be a little while.

00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:16,212
No, I said that we
could <i>try</i> and see a movie.

00:39:16,279 --> 00:39:17,647
Hey, you know what?

00:39:17,713 --> 00:39:20,550
I've got a friend here who
is fighting for his life.

00:39:20,616 --> 00:39:22,118
I would appreciate
a little understanding.

00:39:22,185 --> 00:39:24,453
I will talk about this
with you later. Good-bye.

00:39:25,755 --> 00:39:27,089
How old?

00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:28,925
Fourteen.

00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:30,626
Supposedly.

00:39:30,693 --> 00:39:32,662
I got one of those
in high school myself.

00:39:32,728 --> 00:39:35,598
World's pretty small
at that age.

00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:37,934
It feels pretty small
to me right now, too.

00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,535
WOMAN ( <i>over P.A.</i> ):
Code Blue alert.

00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:04,687
( <i>weakly</i> ):

Hey.

00:41:06,722 --> 00:41:08,491
Have some water.

00:41:15,832 --> 00:41:18,534
Thanks for not pulling the plug.

00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:21,704
Your, uh, fan club is here.

I don't know.

00:41:49,165 --> 00:41:52,869
Most people want to die
in their sleep, I suppose.

00:41:52,935 --> 00:41:54,737
Never know that it's happening.

00:41:54,804 --> 00:41:56,939
Like a crime scene.

00:41:57,006 --> 00:41:59,675
Surprise, you're dead.

00:41:59,742 --> 00:42:04,113
I'd prefer to know in advance
that I was going to die.

00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:08,985
I'd like to be diagnosed
with cancer, actually.

00:42:09,051 --> 00:42:11,120
Have some time to prepare.

00:42:11,187 --> 00:42:13,589
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:17,293
Go back to the rain forest
one more time.

00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,995
Reread <i>Moby Dick.</i>

00:42:20,114 --> 00:42:23,198
Possibly enter an international
chess tournament.

00:42:24,073 --> 00:42:28,037
At least have enough time to say
good-bye to the people I love.

00:42:32,875 --> 00:42:36,156
I'm not ready
to say good-bye.
