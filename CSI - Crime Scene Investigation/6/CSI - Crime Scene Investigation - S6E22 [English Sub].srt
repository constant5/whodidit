BRASS:
A truck driver making
a delivery found him.

00:00:55,171 --> 00:00:56,339
T.O.D.?

00:00:56,406 --> 00:00:57,840
About two or three
hours ago.

00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:01,144
GRISSOM:
Neck contusion.

00:01:03,279 --> 00:01:04,681
Looks like he went down
fighting.

00:01:04,747 --> 00:01:06,482
GRISSOM:
Any ID?

00:01:06,549 --> 00:01:08,251
Just this.

00:01:11,554 --> 00:01:13,122
Palermo room key.

00:01:13,189 --> 00:01:14,424
Nice clothes.

00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:15,892
Well, they do make the man.

00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:19,562
He's got some kind
of transfer on his pants.

00:01:19,629 --> 00:01:21,698
WILLOWS:
Yeah, and on his shirt.

00:01:21,764 --> 00:01:24,434
So what's a guy dressed
for a party

00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,337
with a key to this hotel
doing out here?

00:01:27,403 --> 00:01:28,938
I don't know.

00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:30,974
But the party's over.

Similar to the trace

00:02:09,084 --> 00:02:10,752
on the vic's clothes.

00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:12,020
Same down here.

00:02:12,087 --> 00:02:16,191
So whatever it is,
it must have been wet.

00:02:27,536 --> 00:02:32,074
I don't see any
wet paint signs up here either.

( <i>crowd murmuring</i> )

00:03:17,386 --> 00:03:19,254
MAN:
Two performances nightly

00:03:19,321 --> 00:03:23,058
of Palermo's fabulous show,
"The Girls of India."

00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:26,461
Now on display
at Palermo Jewelers--

00:03:26,528 --> 00:03:28,430
Diamonds at Romanoff's.

00:03:35,203 --> 00:03:38,573
The room is registered
to a Jeffrey Powell
of Van Nuys, California.

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,075
He check in
with anybody?

00:03:40,142 --> 00:03:41,843
No. The reservation
was for one person.

00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,211
He checked in yesterday,

00:03:43,278 --> 00:03:45,080
paid with a
corporate credit card.

00:03:45,147 --> 00:03:46,882
Do you remember
the name of the company?

00:03:46,948 --> 00:03:48,050
Sheritown Inc.

00:03:48,116 --> 00:03:49,051
Sheritown Inc.

00:03:49,117 --> 00:03:50,419
We're going to need access

00:03:50,485 --> 00:03:53,689
to all of the surveillance
footage from tonight, all right?

00:03:53,755 --> 00:03:55,724
You got it.
Okay.

00:03:59,594 --> 00:04:01,830
Two glasses.

00:04:01,897 --> 00:04:03,765
Think our vic got lucky?

00:04:03,832 --> 00:04:06,234
Oh, yeah.

00:04:08,036 --> 00:04:10,038
He got lucky, all right.

00:04:10,105 --> 00:04:11,940
He got lucky

00:04:12,007 --> 00:04:13,909
with a blonde.

00:04:18,113 --> 00:04:19,481
Jeans...

00:04:19,548 --> 00:04:21,650
full of holes.

00:04:21,717 --> 00:04:24,619
Must have been wearing
them a long time.

00:04:24,686 --> 00:04:27,823
Either that or he just bought
them an paid a fortune.

00:04:27,889 --> 00:04:30,826
I remember my first time
to Vegas.

00:04:30,892 --> 00:04:33,061
I got one of these--

00:04:33,128 --> 00:04:34,696
Guide to blackjack.

00:04:34,763 --> 00:04:38,333
Everybody dreams of hitting it
big out here, don't they?

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,269
Yeah, well, if that ever ends
you can kiss Vegas good-bye.

00:04:43,939 --> 00:04:45,607
STOKES:
We have a winner.

00:04:47,576 --> 00:04:49,411
Jackpot.

00:04:49,478 --> 00:04:51,646
Ooh, Sasan.

00:04:51,713 --> 00:04:54,249
Cost him more than all of his
other clothes put together.

00:04:54,316 --> 00:04:56,852
There's some kind
of blue powder trace

00:04:56,918 --> 00:04:59,588
on the pocket.

00:05:00,856 --> 00:05:02,424
Nicky, take this.

00:05:04,926 --> 00:05:07,863
California driver's license.

00:05:07,929 --> 00:05:11,199
Company credit card.

00:05:11,266 --> 00:05:14,569
Amateur Speedway Association
card.

00:05:14,636 --> 00:05:16,838
Guy liked fast cars.

00:05:19,207 --> 00:05:22,310
Except he was driving
a Toyota.

00:05:22,377 --> 00:05:23,478
No cash.

00:05:23,545 --> 00:05:26,748
This sounds like
a classic trick roll.

00:05:26,815 --> 00:05:29,651
<i>Kid from out of town</i>
<i>on a lucky streak--</i>
I cannot lose tonight!

00:05:29,718 --> 00:05:32,120
<i>he's an easy mark.</i>

00:05:32,187 --> 00:05:35,891
<i>Get him up to the room...</i>

00:05:35,957 --> 00:05:38,460
<i>loosen him up...</i>

00:05:38,527 --> 00:05:40,829
jump him and dump him.

00:05:53,175 --> 00:05:54,309
Mom was right--

00:05:54,376 --> 00:05:56,244
always wear
clean ones.

00:05:56,311 --> 00:05:58,013
Because you never know
what could happen.

00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,347
What do you think that is?

00:05:59,414 --> 00:06:00,615
Why don't you take a whiff?

00:06:00,682 --> 00:06:03,285
Why am I always the guy
who has to sniff the shorts?

00:06:03,351 --> 00:06:04,653
'Cause it's your job.

00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,054
You do it.

00:06:11,493 --> 00:06:13,528
Red wine.

00:06:15,897 --> 00:06:17,833
It's not on his pants.

00:06:17,899 --> 00:06:19,101
What about the shirt?

00:06:19,167 --> 00:06:21,169
No.

00:06:21,236 --> 00:06:23,004
So he must have changed
after the mess.

00:06:23,071 --> 00:06:25,874
Oh, I already went through
his pockets.

00:06:29,444 --> 00:06:31,146
Of course, I was double-gloved.

00:06:31,213 --> 00:06:33,715
Clothes are brand new.

00:06:37,219 --> 00:06:38,887
Hmm...

00:06:38,954 --> 00:06:41,056
Looks like a callus.

00:06:44,126 --> 00:06:46,795
STOKES:
There's a long-haired blonde.

00:06:46,862 --> 00:06:49,031
Yeah, I've been watching this
for a while now.

00:06:49,097 --> 00:06:52,768
Time stamped 10:52 p.m.

00:06:52,834 --> 00:06:55,237
He entered his room
a couple of minutes later.

00:06:55,303 --> 00:06:57,406
Manager said the last time
he used his card key

00:06:57,472 --> 00:06:59,875
was 10:54 p.m.

00:06:59,941 --> 00:07:03,912
MAN:
We look forward
about an hour...

00:07:03,979 --> 00:07:06,648
Jeff leaves his room alone.

00:07:06,715 --> 00:07:08,150
STOKES:
He doesn't have
a jacket on.

00:07:08,216 --> 00:07:10,185
He's probably not
going too far.

00:07:10,252 --> 00:07:14,523
So he gets off the elevator,
goes into the casino,

00:07:14,589 --> 00:07:16,191
and nine minutes
later,

00:07:16,258 --> 00:07:18,493
same blonde goes down
in the elevator.

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,328
Mm-hmm.

00:07:20,395 --> 00:07:22,497
Grab that.

00:07:22,564 --> 00:07:24,299
Print that.

00:07:26,134 --> 00:07:28,637
After the vic
gets off the elevator,

00:07:28,704 --> 00:07:30,238
I lose him in
the casino crowd

00:07:30,305 --> 00:07:31,306
for about 15 minutes.

00:07:31,373 --> 00:07:33,008
How do you lose him?

00:07:33,075 --> 00:07:34,509
Aren't there a hundred
cameras in there?

00:07:34,576 --> 00:07:36,078
And at four hours
of video each,

00:07:36,144 --> 00:07:38,280
that's 400 hours of video
I got to go through.

00:07:39,848 --> 00:07:41,616
The vic was found
at the loading dock

00:07:41,683 --> 00:07:43,852
off the shopping arcade.

00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,420
He's heading for
the arcade here.

00:07:45,487 --> 00:07:46,521
That's the last time

00:07:46,588 --> 00:07:48,223
I've got him on camera.

00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:49,758
There's no surveillance
in the arcade hall.

00:07:49,825 --> 00:07:51,793
Only in the individual stores.

00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,795
Freeze that.

00:07:53,862 --> 00:07:56,698
Enhance that bag.

00:07:56,765 --> 00:08:00,001
The vic was wearing
a Sasan jacket.

00:08:01,303 --> 00:08:04,473
There's a Sasan boutique
in the arcade.

00:08:04,539 --> 00:08:06,608
I'm going shopping.

00:08:06,675 --> 00:08:09,611
<i>But you were working</i>
<i>last night.</i>

00:08:09,678 --> 00:08:12,147
Yeah, we've been
short-handed.

00:08:12,214 --> 00:08:14,282
Do you, uh, do you
recognize either one

00:08:14,349 --> 00:08:16,351
of these people?

00:08:18,186 --> 00:08:19,921
No. Sorry.

00:08:21,189 --> 00:08:23,992
How about this?

00:08:24,059 --> 00:08:25,293
Recognize that?

00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,629
Sure. That's from
the new Spring line.

00:08:27,696 --> 00:08:30,665
The leather's like skin.
It's incredible.

00:08:30,732 --> 00:08:32,134
Show me that picture again.

00:08:35,537 --> 00:08:37,739
Now I remember.

00:08:37,806 --> 00:08:39,141
He bought
a whole outfit.

00:08:39,207 --> 00:08:41,076
Even wanted underwear.

00:08:41,143 --> 00:08:42,811
We don't sell underwear.

00:08:42,878 --> 00:08:45,347
Credit card receipt,
anything like that?

00:08:45,414 --> 00:08:46,448
He paid cash.

00:08:46,515 --> 00:08:47,783
He was flashing a wad.

00:08:47,849 --> 00:08:50,519
Mm-hmm. Buy
anything for her?

00:08:50,585 --> 00:08:52,320
Nothing.

00:08:52,387 --> 00:08:53,655
She didn't need anything.

00:08:53,722 --> 00:08:55,190
Looked perfect.

00:08:55,257 --> 00:08:56,625
Was making my job
real easy.

00:09:02,397 --> 00:09:04,066
That guy would have
bought anything

00:09:04,132 --> 00:09:05,701
she wanted him
to, Mr. Stokes.

00:09:08,937 --> 00:09:10,205
Thank you.

00:09:29,257 --> 00:09:32,194
I found extensive contusion

00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:35,864
involving the anterior
aspect of the neck

00:09:35,931 --> 00:09:37,833
with hemorrhage
in all the strap muscles.

00:09:37,899 --> 00:09:39,334
The thyroid, cricoid

00:09:39,401 --> 00:09:42,671
and arytenoid
cartilages are all
multiply fractured.

00:09:46,241 --> 00:09:48,677
The hyoid bone
is fractured as well.

00:09:48,744 --> 00:09:50,579
The blunt-force trauma
to the neck?

00:09:50,645 --> 00:09:53,248
Yeah. COD is asphyxiation

00:09:53,315 --> 00:09:54,850
due to obstruction
of the airway.

00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:56,518
Took a few minutes
to die.

00:09:56,585 --> 00:09:58,387
Any idea of the source
of the BFT?

00:09:58,453 --> 00:10:00,655
Well, I enhanced the contusion
on the neck

00:10:00,722 --> 00:10:02,491
using UV photography.

00:10:02,557 --> 00:10:06,361
Looks like there's a defined
edge on the weapon.

00:10:06,428 --> 00:10:08,897
Yeah, that could be anything.

00:10:08,964 --> 00:10:11,233
How about prelim tox results?

00:10:11,299 --> 00:10:14,369
Well, tox detected
methamphetamine, sildenafil

00:10:14,436 --> 00:10:16,405
and oxycodone.

00:10:16,471 --> 00:10:19,174
Stimulant, erection
and a painkiller.

00:10:19,241 --> 00:10:20,208
Party in a pill.

00:10:20,275 --> 00:10:22,611
Where was that
on my wedding night?

00:10:23,945 --> 00:10:25,914
( <i>siren wailing</i> )

00:10:25,981 --> 00:10:27,416
SANDERS:
<i>Does this couple look familiar?</i>

00:10:27,482 --> 00:10:29,518
Sweet red Ferrari.
F-360 Spyder.

00:10:29,584 --> 00:10:30,752
When did you see them?

00:10:30,819 --> 00:10:32,621
Last night-- I brought
the car when they left.

00:10:32,687 --> 00:10:34,256
Around 8:15.

00:10:34,322 --> 00:10:35,323
They're gone
a couple hours.

00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,925
The car-- pfft--
was amazing.

00:10:36,992 --> 00:10:38,593
Did they happen to tell you
where they were going?

00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,594
No.

00:10:39,661 --> 00:10:41,697
Do you know what time
they got back to the hotel?

00:10:41,763 --> 00:10:43,398
Uh, a little after 10:00.

00:10:43,465 --> 00:10:44,633
The guy gave me
a Benjamin.

00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,834
I kept an eye out
on that baby,

00:10:45,901 --> 00:10:46,968
I didn't want any of
these other maniacs

00:10:47,035 --> 00:10:47,969
putting their paws on it.

00:10:48,036 --> 00:10:50,105
What about the girl?

00:10:50,172 --> 00:10:51,807
You ever seen her before?

00:10:51,873 --> 00:10:53,308
I don't think so.

00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:55,310
She strike you
as a working girl?

00:10:55,377 --> 00:10:56,845
I'll say this,
if she was hooking,

00:10:56,912 --> 00:10:59,214
then she was top shelf,
just like that car.

00:10:59,281 --> 00:11:00,782
I felt kind of like
that garage guy

00:11:00,849 --> 00:11:02,751
in <i>Ferris Bueller's</i>
<i>Day Off?</i>

00:11:02,818 --> 00:11:04,086
You know, he likes
the car so much,

00:11:04,152 --> 00:11:07,122
he takes it out for a spin
for, like, the whole day.

00:11:07,189 --> 00:11:08,390
Not that I'd ever do that.

00:11:08,457 --> 00:11:10,325
Of course not.

00:11:10,392 --> 00:11:11,793
Whoa, look,
I had nothing to do

00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,095
with the damage
on that car.

00:11:16,565 --> 00:11:18,133
I mean, it was pristine
before they took it out.

00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,002
They were in an accident?
How bad?

00:11:21,069 --> 00:11:24,039
Look, any scratch on
that beauty is a tragedy.

00:11:24,106 --> 00:11:26,408
And this was, like, a dent.

00:11:26,475 --> 00:11:27,943
You know what? They looked
like they didn't even care.

00:11:28,009 --> 00:11:29,945
Anything else
I can do for you?

00:11:30,011 --> 00:11:31,847
Um, thanks.

00:11:31,913 --> 00:11:34,282
Lenny.
Lenny Andretti.

00:11:34,349 --> 00:11:35,584
No relation.

00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:37,853
The trace for your
vic's jacket pocket

00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:39,287
was primarily talc.

00:11:39,354 --> 00:11:41,156
Blue baby powder?

00:11:41,223 --> 00:11:44,092
No. Take a look.

00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:47,929
Birefringent crystals.

00:11:47,996 --> 00:11:50,332
Pretty.
What are they?

00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,501
It's a mixture of
silica and axolite,

00:11:52,567 --> 00:11:53,735
two abrasives.

00:11:53,802 --> 00:11:56,972
But when found with talc,
it suggests only one use.

00:11:57,039 --> 00:11:59,174
And that would be?

00:11:59,241 --> 00:12:02,477
In 1897,
William Spinks received a patent

00:12:02,544 --> 00:12:05,347
for what came to be known
as "Spinks Billiard Chalk."

00:12:06,882 --> 00:12:09,117
<i>You may be surprised to know</i>
<i>that cue-tip chalk</i>

00:12:09,184 --> 00:12:10,419
<i>does not contain chalk at all,</i>

00:12:10,485 --> 00:12:13,422
<i>it is a mixture of</i>
<i>axolite and silica.</i>

00:12:13,488 --> 00:12:17,626
<i>The abrasives give grip to</i>
<i>the tip when it hits the ball.</i>

00:12:18,894 --> 00:12:20,362
Stop trying to make
that sound dirty.

00:12:20,429 --> 00:12:23,532
Out vic had a callus
on his hand.
Mm...

00:12:23,598 --> 00:12:25,033
Don't.

00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,935
Which means that
he was probably playing
a lot of pool.

00:12:27,002 --> 00:12:29,504
Where do you go in this town
to shoot stick

00:12:29,571 --> 00:12:31,206
with a hot blonde and a Ferrari?

00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:37,012
BRASS:
There's at least a half a dozen

00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:39,147
of these high-end pool halls
in Vegas.

00:12:39,214 --> 00:12:41,083
The word on the street is

00:12:41,149 --> 00:12:43,452
a lot of out-of-town money
comes through here.

00:12:43,518 --> 00:12:46,054
WILLOWS:
Well, it's closer to Palermo,
it's a good place to start.

00:13:04,773 --> 00:13:06,575
Hey, buddy, how's it going?

00:13:06,641 --> 00:13:08,610
Have these two been in lately?

00:13:09,945 --> 00:13:11,113
No.

00:13:11,179 --> 00:13:12,347
It's pretty dark in here,

00:13:12,414 --> 00:13:14,216
wouldn't recognize my own mom
if she came in.

00:13:14,282 --> 00:13:15,751
It wasn't so dark
you couldn't count your vig

00:13:15,817 --> 00:13:17,052
from that game over there.

00:13:17,119 --> 00:13:19,721
It's not illegal to bet
on a pool game in Nevada.

00:13:19,788 --> 00:13:21,923
But it is illegal for
the house to take a cut

00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:22,924
without
a gaming license.

00:13:22,991 --> 00:13:25,827
I don't see one
on the wall.

00:13:25,894 --> 00:13:28,563
That's because nothing
like that's going on here.

00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,098
BRASS:
So, if we asked everyone
in here, no one would say

00:13:30,165 --> 00:13:32,067
that you're taking
a piece of the action?

00:13:33,435 --> 00:13:34,369
Let me take another look.

00:13:34,436 --> 00:13:35,937
Sure. Knock yourself out.

00:13:36,004 --> 00:13:37,706
I never seen the guy.

00:13:37,773 --> 00:13:38,940
Girl's kind of a regular here.

00:13:39,007 --> 00:13:40,108
Name's Heidi.

00:13:40,175 --> 00:13:42,277
So, I guess your eyes
do get used to the dark.

00:13:42,344 --> 00:13:44,179
You know where
we can find this Heidi?

00:13:44,246 --> 00:13:45,447
Oh, man...

00:13:45,514 --> 00:13:47,282
BRASS:
You know, I don't see
that license anywhere.

00:13:47,349 --> 00:13:48,383
Look, here's what
we're going to do.

00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:49,384
Get on the phone.

00:13:49,451 --> 00:13:50,685
Call Heidi.

00:13:50,752 --> 00:13:52,888
Tell her a distinguished
gentleman has just come in

00:13:52,954 --> 00:13:54,356
with a large wad of cash
looking for some action.

00:13:54,423 --> 00:13:55,957
That'd be me.

00:14:05,934 --> 00:14:06,902
Heidi Wolff?

00:14:06,968 --> 00:14:08,136
How you doing?

00:14:08,203 --> 00:14:10,105
I'm Jim Brass,
Las Vegas Police.

00:14:10,172 --> 00:14:11,106
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

00:14:11,173 --> 00:14:12,908
About what?

00:14:13,709 --> 00:14:14,776
Do you know this guy?

00:14:15,944 --> 00:14:16,878
No.

00:14:16,945 --> 00:14:18,980
Apparently,
you think I do.

00:14:19,047 --> 00:14:20,549
Oh, I know you do.

00:14:20,615 --> 00:14:22,684
You want to tell me
how he turned up dead?

00:14:29,747 --> 00:14:31,663
So you spent the night
with Jeff Powell.

00:14:31,789 --> 00:14:33,991
And he was alive
when he left me.

00:14:34,058 --> 00:14:35,759
Oh. He left you?

00:14:35,826 --> 00:14:38,062
Yeah. Believe it or not.

00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:39,463
Look.

00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:42,967
He was getting
kind of weird on me.

00:14:45,169 --> 00:14:46,103
Hey.

00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:47,905
Where you going?

00:14:47,972 --> 00:14:49,240
Don't worry, I'll be right back.

00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:52,243
You know, I think I may just
have to fall in love with you.

00:14:56,580 --> 00:15:00,217
So I put on my clothes
and I got out of there.

00:15:00,284 --> 00:15:01,685
I was looking for fun,

00:15:01,752 --> 00:15:04,455
not a lifetime
commitment.

00:15:04,522 --> 00:15:06,257
Is that what you call fun?

00:15:06,323 --> 00:15:07,892
Rolling a guy,
taking his money?

00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:09,860
I didn't take his money.

00:15:09,927 --> 00:15:11,829
Heidi, Heidi, ho.

00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:17,635
Look, we know Jeff was waving
around a large wedge of cash.

00:15:17,701 --> 00:15:20,304
And the money was gone
when we found him.

00:15:20,371 --> 00:15:22,172
You're an expensive date, Heidi.

00:15:22,239 --> 00:15:24,441
I'm a professional gambler.

00:15:24,508 --> 00:15:27,211
Probably the only one in Vegas
who declares every dollar.

00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:28,646
You can check my tax returns.

00:15:28,712 --> 00:15:31,048
We checked
the hotel sheets.

00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,785
We had sex.

00:15:34,852 --> 00:15:36,754
Is that against the law? No.

00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,022
No.

00:15:38,088 --> 00:15:39,256
We won some money shooting pool.

00:15:39,323 --> 00:15:42,159
Is that against the law? No.

00:15:42,226 --> 00:15:43,561
You gave him drugs.

00:15:43,627 --> 00:15:44,862
Is that against the law?

00:15:47,031 --> 00:15:48,165
Yeah.

00:15:48,232 --> 00:15:51,135
Look, here's
the way I see it
breaking down.

00:15:51,202 --> 00:15:54,038
You left the room
nine minutes after he did.

00:15:54,104 --> 00:15:55,239
You went downstairs.

00:15:55,306 --> 00:15:57,107
You checked
with your partner.

00:15:57,174 --> 00:15:59,443
You killed the kid,
you took the cash,

00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:01,045
end of story.

00:16:01,111 --> 00:16:03,414
Let's get this straight.

00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,950
He was a sweet kid
and I'm sorry he's dead,

00:16:06,016 --> 00:16:07,651
but I had nothing to do with it.

00:16:07,718 --> 00:16:09,687
And I'm done talking.

00:16:09,753 --> 00:16:12,289
SANDERS:
According to the DMV,

00:16:12,356 --> 00:16:14,925
of the 12 Ferrari F-360 Spyders
registered in Vegas,

00:16:14,992 --> 00:16:16,260
only three are red.

00:16:16,327 --> 00:16:17,528
Two of them are privately owned,

00:16:17,595 --> 00:16:18,762
and a rental company
has the third.

00:16:18,829 --> 00:16:21,632
Since the vic owns a Toyota
in L.A.

00:16:21,699 --> 00:16:22,967
and Heidi Wolff
drives a Beetle...

00:16:23,033 --> 00:16:25,069
You figured this would be
a good place to start.

00:16:25,135 --> 00:16:27,037
Welcome to
Extravagant Auto.

00:16:27,104 --> 00:16:28,339
Robert Rhoda.

00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:30,074
If what you're dreaming
about's on four wheels,

00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,175
I can get it for you.

00:16:31,242 --> 00:16:33,711
Actually, we're looking
for a red Ferrari Spyder.

00:16:33,777 --> 00:16:35,279
The lady likes fast cars.

00:16:35,346 --> 00:16:36,747
And I just happen
to have one.

00:16:36,814 --> 00:16:39,283
But it got into
a little fender-bender,

00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:41,986
so it's going to take a day
or so to get it fixed.

00:16:43,454 --> 00:16:45,489
We'll take it as is.

00:16:46,824 --> 00:16:49,927
Looks like paint transfer
on the left rear quarter.

00:16:49,994 --> 00:16:52,096
Clear coat's been peeled
front-to-back.

00:16:52,162 --> 00:16:55,132
Which means the Ferrari was
the faster vehicle.

00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,434
The Ferrari is always
the faster vehicle.

00:17:00,704 --> 00:17:02,573
( <i>camera clicks</i> )

00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,807
Ooh.

00:17:03,874 --> 00:17:07,344
Nice dent
to the front bumper.

00:17:07,411 --> 00:17:09,179
RHODA:
You're looking at $15,000
of damage there.

00:17:09,246 --> 00:17:10,781
Who rented it?

00:17:10,848 --> 00:17:12,683
Can't help you with that.

00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,952
Our customer records
are confidential.

00:17:15,019 --> 00:17:16,620
In any case, we're not making
a police report

00:17:16,687 --> 00:17:17,855
about the damage.

00:17:17,922 --> 00:17:20,491
No need to,
we're impounding it.

00:17:20,558 --> 00:17:21,492
( <i>car door opens</i> )

00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:22,626
What?

00:17:22,693 --> 00:17:25,095
Looks like the interior's
been cleaned.

00:17:25,162 --> 00:17:26,363
I'll call auto transport

00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:28,499
and have them tow it
back to the lot.

00:17:28,566 --> 00:17:30,000
( <i>camera phone beeping</i> )

00:17:30,067 --> 00:17:31,702
Mr. Rhoda, what are you doing?

00:17:31,769 --> 00:17:34,705
I'm documenting my loss.

00:17:34,772 --> 00:17:37,341
I'm filing for crime victim
compensation.

00:17:37,408 --> 00:17:38,742
( <i>camera phone beeping</i> )

( <i>machine whirrs</i> )

00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:50,848
Grissom?

00:18:50,915 --> 00:18:52,516
Hodges confirmed
the paint transfer

00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:55,286
on the Ferrari is
a black acrylic enamel.

00:18:55,352 --> 00:18:56,520
That doesn't
narrow it down much.

00:18:56,587 --> 00:18:57,555
Well, it gets better.

00:18:57,621 --> 00:18:59,256
It's a GM paint,
with traces

00:18:59,323 --> 00:19:01,058
of fiberglass
reinforced plastic.

00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:03,827
Which means, we're looking
for a black Corvette.

00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:05,829
I'll have Brass
put out a broadcast.

00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:07,698
Nick ran the vic's
credit card.

00:19:07,765 --> 00:19:09,466
"Sheritown, Inc." is
based in L.A.,

00:19:09,533 --> 00:19:11,368
run by a guy named
Mick Sheridan.

00:19:11,435 --> 00:19:13,003
I'm going to meet him
at the P.D.

00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,972
Mick Sheridan
the movie producer?

00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,974
I grew up watching
his action blockbusters--

00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:19,877
car chases, ninjas,
cyborg death machines.

00:19:19,944 --> 00:19:21,912
We used to make
body armor

00:19:21,979 --> 00:19:23,747
out of tinfoil, and
re-enact the scenes

00:19:23,814 --> 00:19:25,082
all over
the neighborhood.

00:19:25,149 --> 00:19:26,951
What about you, you were
a Green Beret kid?

00:19:27,017 --> 00:19:27,952
Secret agent?

00:19:28,018 --> 00:19:28,953
I'm not telling.

00:19:29,019 --> 00:19:30,788
And stay away
from my tinfoil.

Of all kids.

Jeff.

00:19:42,399 --> 00:19:44,301
I can't stop crying.

00:19:44,368 --> 00:19:46,136
You want something to drink?

00:19:46,203 --> 00:19:47,771
Oh, thanks, uh...

00:19:47,838 --> 00:19:51,075
Small Pellegrino,

00:19:56,013 --> 00:20:00,384
Mr. Sheridan, can you tell us
anything about this girl?

00:20:02,019 --> 00:20:03,821
I don't know her.

00:20:03,888 --> 00:20:05,523
Jeff must have
met her here.

00:20:07,658 --> 00:20:10,227
I loved him
like a son.

00:20:10,294 --> 00:20:12,263
Smart.
Hard-working.

00:20:12,329 --> 00:20:14,098
I hired him right
out of law school.

00:20:14,164 --> 00:20:16,467
What kind of work
did he do for you?

00:20:16,534 --> 00:20:18,035
An assistant.

00:20:18,102 --> 00:20:20,237
He wanted to learn
the movie business

00:20:20,304 --> 00:20:22,206
from the bottom up,
like I did.

00:20:22,273 --> 00:20:25,342
Oh, right,
you used to be an actor.

00:20:25,409 --> 00:20:29,013
Yeah. But I had a nasty habit--
I wanted to eat regularly.

00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:31,815
And didn't want to work
as a waiter to do it.

00:20:31,882 --> 00:20:34,051
Did Jeff have any
nasty habits?

00:20:36,086 --> 00:20:40,357
We found several different
drugs in his bloodstream.

00:20:40,424 --> 00:20:42,059
BRASS:
What was Jeff doing

00:20:42,126 --> 00:20:43,494
in Las Vegas?

00:20:43,561 --> 00:20:46,864
Um... About a month ago,

00:20:46,931 --> 00:20:48,866
when he was making copies
of my divorce settlement,

00:20:48,933 --> 00:20:51,468
he spotted a provision

00:20:51,535 --> 00:20:53,837
that my wife's lawyer
had rephrased.

00:20:53,904 --> 00:20:54,872
My lawyers
had missed it.

00:20:54,939 --> 00:20:57,641
He saved me
millions of dollars.

00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:59,510
So to thank him,
I gave him a vacation.

00:20:59,577 --> 00:21:01,378
You give him any cash?

00:21:01,445 --> 00:21:04,148
Couple hundred bucks,
corporate credit card.

00:21:04,215 --> 00:21:07,451
Told him to have fun.

00:21:07,518 --> 00:21:08,652
Fun, huh?

00:21:08,719 --> 00:21:11,622
Yeah.

00:21:11,689 --> 00:21:14,291
I'll be regretting that
for the rest of my life.

00:21:19,453 --> 00:21:21,322
I guess the
broadcast paid off.

00:21:21,388 --> 00:21:22,489
Black Corvette.

00:21:22,556 --> 00:21:23,657
Parking enforcement

00:21:23,724 --> 00:21:25,859
found it abandoned
off Durango near Russell.

00:21:25,926 --> 00:21:27,661
Right between the pool hall

00:21:27,728 --> 00:21:28,662
and the Palermo?

00:21:28,729 --> 00:21:29,697
Yup.

00:21:29,763 --> 00:21:31,465
( <i>camera shutter clicking</i> )

00:21:31,532 --> 00:21:33,667
This would have been impossible
to drive away.

00:21:33,734 --> 00:21:35,602
Yeah.

00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:37,705
Bummer.

00:21:37,771 --> 00:21:40,574
Please tell me there's
something more to this
guys and cars thing

00:21:40,641 --> 00:21:42,042
beside the obvious penis
extension metaphors.

00:21:42,109 --> 00:21:44,178
So you want me to lie?

00:21:53,487 --> 00:21:55,255
Red paint transfer.

00:21:58,959 --> 00:22:01,729
( <i>engine revving</i> )

00:22:01,795 --> 00:22:04,398
( <i>brakes screeching</i> )

00:22:04,465 --> 00:22:06,233
I'll get a sample to Hodges.

00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,035
See if he can

00:22:08,102 --> 00:22:09,970
match it to the Ferrari.

00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,509
It's a rental.

00:22:15,576 --> 00:22:17,878
Extravagant Automobiles?

00:22:17,945 --> 00:22:19,913
No. Zenith?

00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,383
Yeah, night to be
in the car rental business.

00:22:22,449 --> 00:22:24,585
Driver's name is Randy Bolen.

00:22:24,652 --> 00:22:26,587
Local address.

00:22:26,654 --> 00:22:29,456
Let's go talk to him.

00:22:29,523 --> 00:22:32,626
( <i>distant siren</i> )

00:22:32,693 --> 00:22:35,529
"Randy Bolen.

00:22:35,596 --> 00:22:37,998
"Misdemeanor
possession, assault,

00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:40,868
"felony possession
for sales..."

00:22:42,636 --> 00:22:45,773
You can't help
but break the
law, can you?

00:22:47,508 --> 00:22:49,543
What's with the forehead?

00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:56,250
Well, you got
that bruise somehow.

00:22:56,317 --> 00:23:00,421
Want me to add leaving the scene
of an accident to the list?

00:23:01,855 --> 00:23:04,291
It was a fender bender.
Not my fault.

00:23:04,358 --> 00:23:05,893
Sure about that?

00:23:05,959 --> 00:23:07,895
Yeah.

00:23:07,961 --> 00:23:11,632
Because your car and the Ferrari
were both rented.

00:23:11,699 --> 00:23:13,667
So what? It's a coincidence.

00:23:13,734 --> 00:23:15,769
You're a local.
Why did you need to rent a car?

00:23:15,836 --> 00:23:19,573
I can't afford one all the time,
so I rent one when I can.

00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:23,143
What were you doing all night
before your fender bender?

00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:25,546
What was I doing?
I was shooting pool.

00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:28,315
Place called The... The Cue-T.

00:23:28,382 --> 00:23:30,184
How'd you play?
Did you win any money?

00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:32,119
You know, you win some,
you lose some.

00:23:49,269 --> 00:23:53,007
( <i>applause and cheering</i> )

00:23:53,578 --> 00:23:55,881
I guess that would be lose some.

00:23:55,947 --> 00:23:57,916
How much?

00:24:00,218 --> 00:24:02,354
Ten grand.

00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:05,323
That's a lot of money
for a guy like you.

00:24:07,926 --> 00:24:10,028
( <i>scattered laughing</i>
<i>and clapping</i> )

00:24:13,532 --> 00:24:16,401
I've had worse nights.

00:24:16,468 --> 00:24:17,903
( <i>Curtis laughs</i> )

00:24:17,969 --> 00:24:19,371
Yeah, I'm sure you have.

00:24:19,437 --> 00:24:21,973
You're having one now.

00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,441
These the guys you played?

00:24:27,979 --> 00:24:29,681
Yeah.

00:24:29,748 --> 00:24:31,149
Now, there's a coincidence,

00:24:31,216 --> 00:24:33,185
because they were
in the Ferrari,

00:24:33,251 --> 00:24:36,354
which makes you
a very sore loser.

00:24:41,993 --> 00:24:43,795
( <i>engine revving</i> )

00:24:47,165 --> 00:24:50,402
( <i>thudding</i> )

00:24:53,672 --> 00:24:55,207
( <i>brakes screeching</i> )

00:24:59,311 --> 00:25:00,712
( <i>tires squealing</i> )

00:25:00,779 --> 00:25:02,781
Okay.

00:25:02,848 --> 00:25:04,316
So I rubbed him a little.

00:25:04,382 --> 00:25:06,084
It was a stupid thing to do.

00:25:06,151 --> 00:25:08,119
Not as stupid as killing him.

00:25:09,921 --> 00:25:12,224
What, that kid-- he's dead?

00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:14,459
Yeah.

00:25:18,997 --> 00:25:21,366
I want a lawyer.

00:25:21,433 --> 00:25:22,534
According to
his record,

00:25:22,601 --> 00:25:24,703
Randy Bolen used to be a
professional stunt driver.

00:25:24,769 --> 00:25:26,705
Must not have been
a very good one.

00:25:26,771 --> 00:25:28,573
He teaches at that
track off Boulder Highway

00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,875
where middle-aged guys get

00:25:29,941 --> 00:25:31,510
to act out their
Grand Prix fantasies.

00:25:31,576 --> 00:25:32,677
Mm-hmm, okay.

00:25:32,744 --> 00:25:35,881
A guy like that gets beat
by a punk kid on the street,

00:25:35,947 --> 00:25:37,782
it's gonna be an assault
on his manhood.

00:25:37,849 --> 00:25:38,950
He's got a temper.

00:25:39,017 --> 00:25:41,786
Okay. I'll see
if I can place him at the hotel.

00:25:41,853 --> 00:25:42,954
I'll let you know.

00:25:43,021 --> 00:25:44,890
Hey, Arch.
Hey.

00:25:44,956 --> 00:25:46,892
Surveillance footage
from the Palermo?

00:25:46,958 --> 00:25:48,093
Yeah.

00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,362
I just found something
really interesting.

00:25:50,428 --> 00:25:53,265
That's the blonde
from the elevator.

00:25:53,331 --> 00:25:55,333
There she is again.

00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,436
And here's Jeff Powell.

00:25:58,503 --> 00:25:59,971
This is where his
evening begins,

00:26:00,038 --> 00:26:01,973
when he meets her
for the first time.

00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,175
( <i>beeps</i> )

00:26:03,241 --> 00:26:05,177
Ooh.

00:26:05,243 --> 00:26:07,279
She didn't look too happy.

00:26:07,345 --> 00:26:08,847
Yeah.

00:26:08,914 --> 00:26:10,315
Keep watching

00:26:10,382 --> 00:26:11,850
when she points
at something.

00:26:11,917 --> 00:26:14,886
Keep your eyes
on her wine.

00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,557
( <i>beeps</i> )

00:26:21,927 --> 00:26:24,095
You think that was on purpose?

00:26:24,162 --> 00:26:26,865
Well, sure looks that way.

00:26:26,932 --> 00:26:28,133
Take a look
at this.

00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,668
( <i>whirring, beep</i> )

00:26:29,734 --> 00:26:31,770
Girl was loaded.

00:26:31,837 --> 00:26:35,540
It's safe to say she wasn't
after him for his money.

00:26:35,607 --> 00:26:37,375
Hey.

00:26:37,442 --> 00:26:38,810
Hey.

00:26:38,877 --> 00:26:41,880
Warrants came through
on the rental agreements.

00:26:41,947 --> 00:26:44,483
Jeff Powell went a little crazy
with his corporate card

00:26:44,549 --> 00:26:46,151
and rented the Ferrari himself?

00:26:46,218 --> 00:26:48,520
No. Heidi Wolff rented it.

00:26:48,587 --> 00:26:50,388
The reservation was held
in her name

00:26:50,455 --> 00:26:52,123
by a company called
Caprice Unlimited.

00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:53,892
This is where
it gets interesting.

00:26:53,959 --> 00:26:57,729
Caprice Unlimited also rented
Randy Bolen's Corvette.

00:26:57,796 --> 00:26:59,297
What kind of business is it?

00:26:59,364 --> 00:27:01,867
All I know so far is that
they're unlisted.

00:27:01,933 --> 00:27:05,804
Well, nothing's entirely
unlisted these days.

00:27:05,871 --> 00:27:08,373
Caprice Unlimited.

00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,375
Mm-hmm.

00:27:10,442 --> 00:27:13,345
( <i>beep</i> )

00:27:13,411 --> 00:27:16,548

00:27:16,615 --> 00:27:19,584
"Anything is possible."

00:27:19,651 --> 00:27:21,586
Sounds like a sex business.

00:27:21,653 --> 00:27:25,056
What are you going to say?

00:27:25,123 --> 00:27:26,858
Uh, something other than,

00:27:26,925 --> 00:27:29,594
"A guy is dead, and it looks
like you're involved."

00:27:29,661 --> 00:27:31,930

00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,068
Not taking calls.

00:27:37,135 --> 00:27:40,639
Let's see if they're making any.

00:27:43,942 --> 00:27:46,144
( <i>computer whirring</i> )

00:28:04,496 --> 00:28:06,765
Triangulation's
consistent.

00:28:06,832 --> 00:28:10,602
Caprice Unlimited
made the calls
from this address.

00:28:10,669 --> 00:28:14,039
According to the building owner,
Caprice is only

00:28:14,105 --> 00:28:16,174
renting it
for two days.

00:28:39,464 --> 00:28:41,466
MAN:
No, not quite.

00:28:44,703 --> 00:28:46,805
Oh, yes.

00:28:46,872 --> 00:28:48,406
Perfect.

00:28:48,473 --> 00:28:49,808
You two,

00:28:49,875 --> 00:28:51,743
go get your
costumes and

00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:53,545
find out
what's expected of you.

00:28:53,612 --> 00:28:55,814
Why don't you wait
for me inside?

00:28:57,883 --> 00:28:59,751
MAN: ( <i>clears throat</i> ):
I'm sorry.

00:28:59,818 --> 00:29:01,953
This is a private residence.

00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,989
My name is Gil Grissom,
this is Sara Sidle.

00:29:04,055 --> 00:29:05,123
We're with the Crime Lab.

00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:06,958
Anthony Caprice.

00:29:07,025 --> 00:29:08,960
There's no crime here.

00:29:09,027 --> 00:29:10,529
That was a job interview.

00:29:10,595 --> 00:29:12,931
Over $150,000 has been
spent on this event.

00:29:12,998 --> 00:29:14,599
It's for several
golf club salesman.

00:29:14,666 --> 00:29:16,501
They're from
Kansas City.

00:29:16,568 --> 00:29:20,472
Japanese formality
will mesh very nicely
with their inherent

00:29:20,539 --> 00:29:21,740
Midwestern
restraint.

00:29:21,806 --> 00:29:24,843
Their idealized
woman-- submissive,

00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:27,979
but in control--
becomes the geisha.

00:29:29,014 --> 00:29:30,782
I get it.

00:29:30,849 --> 00:29:34,186
You're one of those companies
that stages fantasies, right?

00:29:34,252 --> 00:29:35,620
Everything appears real,

00:29:35,687 --> 00:29:37,722
but it's all been worked out
in advance?

00:29:37,789 --> 00:29:41,193
These scenarios take
weeks to craft.

00:29:41,259 --> 00:29:43,328
I learn everything

00:29:43,395 --> 00:29:46,798
about my client's
wants and his desires,

00:29:46,865 --> 00:29:48,900
all without him
even knowing.

00:29:48,967 --> 00:29:51,736
Secret longings--

00:29:51,803 --> 00:29:53,972
they have a... a
kind of electricity.

00:29:54,039 --> 00:29:55,807
They're often

00:29:55,874 --> 00:29:58,844
much more visible than
we would want them to be.

00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:02,347
And, uh, Jeff Powell's evening--

00:30:02,414 --> 00:30:05,050
the girl, the car,
the billiards--

00:30:05,116 --> 00:30:06,985
all paid for
by Mick Sheridan?

00:30:07,052 --> 00:30:08,520
Never heard of him.

00:30:08,587 --> 00:30:09,955
Who did pay?

00:30:10,021 --> 00:30:11,356
A benefactor.

00:30:11,423 --> 00:30:13,058
Wishes to
remain anonymous.

00:30:13,124 --> 00:30:16,161
GRISSOM:
Somebody rich who likes
to manipulate people probably.

00:30:16,228 --> 00:30:18,997
Everybody likes
to be in control.

00:30:19,064 --> 00:30:20,932
You don't have to
be rich to want that.

00:30:20,999 --> 00:30:22,167
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:30:22,234 --> 00:30:24,102
If you're so law-abiding,
why did Heidi Wolff

00:30:24,169 --> 00:30:26,538
and Randy Bolen
lie to the police
about what happened?

00:30:26,605 --> 00:30:28,440
Did you tell them to do that?

00:30:28,507 --> 00:30:30,342
All my employees have
a very strict

00:30:30,408 --> 00:30:32,911
non-disclosure agreement
that they have to sign,

00:30:32,978 --> 00:30:35,113
although, I'd never expect them
to lie to the police.

00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:37,616
Maybe you just asked them
the wrong questions.

00:30:37,682 --> 00:30:40,685
Here's a copy
of Mr. Powell's scenario.

00:30:40,752 --> 00:30:43,455
Every event that they talked
about was meticulously planned

00:30:43,522 --> 00:30:47,559
in advance and timed
down to the minute.

00:30:47,626 --> 00:30:49,594
And his murder?

00:30:49,661 --> 00:30:51,730
Tragic.

00:30:51,796 --> 00:30:53,798
But it's not in my script.

00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,735
Now, if you'll excuse me,

00:30:56,801 --> 00:30:58,236
I have a hot tub
to calibrate.

00:30:58,303 --> 00:31:00,238
Oh.

00:31:01,673 --> 00:31:05,343
And may all <i>your</i> dreams
come true.

00:31:10,327 --> 00:31:13,130
Well, I hope this means
you know what happened to Jeff.

00:31:13,197 --> 00:31:15,699
That's the first time
that the tower

00:31:15,766 --> 00:31:18,001
yanked back my Gulfstream
on takeoff.

00:31:18,068 --> 00:31:19,336
No kidding.

00:31:19,403 --> 00:31:20,904
Well, there's always a
first for everything.

00:31:20,971 --> 00:31:22,105
We can talk in here.

00:31:22,172 --> 00:31:24,341
Something wrong
with your office?

00:31:24,408 --> 00:31:26,643
No.

00:31:28,645 --> 00:31:29,847
You seem to have bad luck

00:31:29,913 --> 00:31:32,716
with the people
who work for you.

00:31:32,783 --> 00:31:36,487
If that's a joke, it's
in pretty poor taste.

00:31:36,553 --> 00:31:38,422
Three years ago,
you were busted

00:31:38,489 --> 00:31:40,290
with an eight ball
of cocaine in your luggage.

00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:42,826
You claimed that your personal
assistant had planted it.

00:31:42,893 --> 00:31:44,561
That's because he did.

00:31:44,628 --> 00:31:47,331
The charges against
me were dropped.

00:31:47,397 --> 00:31:49,633
The poor kid
had a serious problem.

00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,134
I got him into a program.

00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:52,536
Understand he's doing
better now.

00:31:52,603 --> 00:31:56,607
I hear you bought him a car
to shut him up and take the rap.

00:31:56,673 --> 00:31:58,742
The media spins every...

00:32:00,811 --> 00:32:02,379
The media.

00:32:04,581 --> 00:32:07,551
We found an ounce of cocaine in
Jeff Powell's personal effects.

00:32:07,618 --> 00:32:08,852
He was buying drugs for you.

00:32:08,919 --> 00:32:11,255
I don't do drugs.

00:32:11,321 --> 00:32:14,491
And I had no idea
that Jeff had a drug problem.

00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:16,360
Last time, you bought a car,

00:32:16,426 --> 00:32:19,596
this time, an elaborate fantasy
to shut him up.

00:32:19,663 --> 00:32:21,532
Problem is, he's dead.

00:32:21,598 --> 00:32:23,800
And that makes you
responsible.

00:32:23,867 --> 00:32:26,970
Captain Brass...

00:32:27,037 --> 00:32:29,072
you've seen
too many of my movies.

00:32:31,141 --> 00:32:34,011
I'd like to call
my attorney now.

00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:36,346
SIDLE:
The script for Jeff's fantasy

00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:39,149
starts with Heidi and Randy
renting the cars at 6:00 p.m.

00:32:39,216 --> 00:32:41,385
Then it says Randy
drives the Corvette

00:32:41,451 --> 00:32:42,519
to The Cue-T
and waits.

00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:43,887
WILLOWS:
And Heidi takes the Ferrari.

00:32:43,954 --> 00:32:45,756
Finds Jeff

00:32:45,823 --> 00:32:48,458
at the Palermo bar.

00:32:48,525 --> 00:32:50,494
SIDLE:
Her instructions were:
"Act upset.

00:32:50,561 --> 00:32:52,496
<i>"Make up story about abusive</i>
<i>high roller boyfriend.</i>

00:32:52,563 --> 00:32:55,833
<i>Allow Jeff to offer comfort."</i>

00:32:55,899 --> 00:32:56,934
Sorry. I'm really okay.

00:32:58,101 --> 00:33:00,003
No, I'm not.

00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:01,572
Anything I can do for you?

00:33:01,638 --> 00:33:04,441
It's my damn boyfriend.

00:33:05,742 --> 00:33:09,246
Any guy would help a beautiful
woman in distress, right?

00:33:09,313 --> 00:33:11,248
Some guys are intimidated
by beauty

00:33:11,315 --> 00:33:14,585
or fear rejection.

00:33:14,651 --> 00:33:15,652
Evidently, Caprice knew Jeff
well enough

00:33:15,719 --> 00:33:16,920
to know he'd want to help her.

00:33:16,987 --> 00:33:18,422
Heidi's next
instructions were:

00:33:18,489 --> 00:33:21,992
"Repay subject's kindness
by buying drink."

00:33:22,059 --> 00:33:25,662
Which she then accidentally
spills on his clothes.

00:33:25,729 --> 00:33:28,632
<i>Insists on buying him</i>
<i>a new outfit,</i>

00:33:28,699 --> 00:33:31,201
<i>one that he couldn't afford</i>
<i>on his own.</i>

00:33:31,268 --> 00:33:33,937
SIDLE:
<i>Everything was scripted</i>
<i>down to the minute--</i>

00:33:34,004 --> 00:33:35,172
<i>the clothes,</i>

00:33:35,239 --> 00:33:36,607
<i>The Cue-T,</i>

00:33:36,673 --> 00:33:39,576
<i>the car.</i>

00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:41,612
Sheridan told Caprice

00:33:41,678 --> 00:33:43,881
that Jeff had been shooting pool
since he was a kid.

00:33:43,947 --> 00:33:45,682
So betting on
and winning

00:33:45,749 --> 00:33:48,185
a big money game was probably
just part of the fantasy.

00:33:48,252 --> 00:33:49,853
Yeah, and he was a NASCAR fan.

00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,422
So the whole staged car chase,
narrow getaway

00:33:52,489 --> 00:33:53,757
was everything he dreamed about.

00:33:53,824 --> 00:33:56,460
As was the partying
in his hotel room.

00:33:56,527 --> 00:33:58,095
And the sex.

00:33:58,162 --> 00:33:59,296
SIDLE:
Not quite.

00:33:59,363 --> 00:34:00,564
According to
the script,

00:34:00,631 --> 00:34:02,799
"Your employment ends
with the good-night kiss.

00:34:02,866 --> 00:34:04,902
"You are not
requested to perform,

00:34:04,968 --> 00:34:06,570
"nor compensated for,

00:34:06,637 --> 00:34:08,272
"any activity you initiate
beyond this point.

00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:13,443
<i>Should nature take its course,</i>
<i>you are on your own."</i>

00:34:15,212 --> 00:34:16,380
( <i>laughing</i> )

00:34:16,446 --> 00:34:17,381
GRISSOM:
So the staged fantasy

00:34:17,447 --> 00:34:19,449
ended at Jeff's hotel room.

00:34:21,018 --> 00:34:23,153
Which means he was off script
when he was killed.

00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,922
STOKES:
I don't get it.

00:34:24,988 --> 00:34:27,958
After a night like that,
I would have felt like Superman.

00:34:28,025 --> 00:34:29,459
Why leave the girl?

00:34:31,695 --> 00:34:34,731
The victim got to
the shopping arcade

00:34:34,798 --> 00:34:37,334
15 minutes after
he got off the elevator.

00:34:37,401 --> 00:34:38,569
It's not that long a walk.

00:34:38,635 --> 00:34:41,405
I need to know what he was
doing during that time.

00:34:43,207 --> 00:34:44,708
There's your guy.

00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:52,182
Whatever he's reacting to
is off camera.

00:34:52,249 --> 00:34:56,186
Somewhere in the direction
of the baccarat tables.

00:34:56,253 --> 00:34:59,122
When the blonde came up to the
vic in the bar the first time,

00:34:59,189 --> 00:35:00,824
she pointed
in that same direction.

00:35:00,891 --> 00:35:02,759
What's going on over there?

00:35:04,261 --> 00:35:07,965
He's playing solo
with the dealer.

00:35:08,031 --> 00:35:10,334
That's ten or 20,000 a hand.

00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,668
Guy's a whale.

00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:16,974
Your vic's really going at him.

00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:22,312
You know, Heidi was only
supposed to tell a story

00:35:22,379 --> 00:35:25,849
about a high roller boyfriend.

00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:28,952
Maybe she actually
picked somebody out.

00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:34,224
( <i>stomps feet</i> )

00:35:34,291 --> 00:35:35,926
What are you doing?

00:35:35,993 --> 00:35:38,262
I've been looking at video
three days solid now.

00:35:38,328 --> 00:35:40,097
My butt fell asleep.

00:35:43,167 --> 00:35:45,235
Wait a second.

00:35:45,302 --> 00:35:46,370
I've seen those guys

00:35:46,436 --> 00:35:49,006
behind him somewhere else.

00:35:49,072 --> 00:35:50,040
Hang on.

00:35:50,107 --> 00:35:52,676
Jeff went from the casino

00:35:52,743 --> 00:35:54,378
to shopping arcade,

00:35:54,444 --> 00:35:56,547
And right behind him,
it's them.

00:35:56,613 --> 00:35:58,282
Same guys.

00:36:05,823 --> 00:36:08,425
Well, call me Ishmael.

00:36:08,492 --> 00:36:10,027
Why?

00:36:10,093 --> 00:36:12,262
You need to read more, Arch.

00:36:15,933 --> 00:36:19,503
GRISSOM:
Jeff was a winner at everything
he tried that night.

00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:21,305
And he was
falling in love.

00:36:21,371 --> 00:36:24,575
Which can make a guy do
some pretty stupid things.

00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:27,344
So anytime more than
$10,000 hits the table,

00:36:27,411 --> 00:36:29,813
the casino's required
to I.D. the player.

00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,849
Which may help us
harpoon a whale.

00:36:31,915 --> 00:36:32,916
Yep.

00:36:35,986 --> 00:36:37,855
MAN:
What's the occasion?

00:36:37,921 --> 00:36:39,723
We're investigating the death
of the young man

00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:40,824
on the casino's
loading dock.

00:36:40,891 --> 00:36:41,825
Are you familiar

00:36:41,892 --> 00:36:42,893
with this guy?

00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,127
That's Dennis Kim.

00:36:44,194 --> 00:36:45,629
Flies in four,
five times a year

00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:47,297
from Seoul to
play baccarat.

00:36:47,364 --> 00:36:48,899
Very generous player.

00:36:48,966 --> 00:36:51,635
We reserve a table exclusively
for him while he's in town.

00:36:51,702 --> 00:36:53,003
He still in town?

00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:55,606
Yeah.

00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:56,974
He's at his table right now.

00:36:58,375 --> 00:37:01,578
Player has two.

00:37:01,645 --> 00:37:02,713
Bank.

00:37:02,779 --> 00:37:05,015
Mr. Kim, we need
to speak with you for a moment.

00:37:05,082 --> 00:37:06,783
Yes?

00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:09,153
Do you recognize this man?

00:37:12,489 --> 00:37:14,124
Why?

00:37:14,191 --> 00:37:15,659
He's dead.

00:37:17,327 --> 00:37:19,163
Just before he died,
he was talking to you.

00:37:21,398 --> 00:37:22,733
Oh, yes, I remember him.

00:37:22,799 --> 00:37:24,301
He was shouting about some girl.

00:37:24,368 --> 00:37:26,236
Hey you!

00:37:26,303 --> 00:37:27,938
Hey! Guess what?

00:37:28,005 --> 00:37:32,109
Heidi, she doesn't need you
or your money anymore, man.

00:37:32,176 --> 00:37:35,012
That's right. Because she has
everything she needs now--

00:37:35,078 --> 00:37:36,680
love and respect.

00:37:36,747 --> 00:37:39,116
So you go ahead and play
your little card game.

00:37:39,183 --> 00:37:40,117
All right?

00:37:40,184 --> 00:37:41,351
'Cause you the playa.

00:37:41,418 --> 00:37:42,820
But I'm the man.

00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:45,289
The man.

00:37:45,355 --> 00:37:46,957
Crazy boy.

00:37:47,024 --> 00:37:49,326
Did you guys
see where he went?

00:37:51,028 --> 00:37:52,563
( <i>speaking Korean</i> )

00:37:52,629 --> 00:37:54,064
( <i>speaking Korean</i> )

00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:02,639
Well, we're gonna need
to take those shoes.

00:38:02,706 --> 00:38:04,208
White paint.

00:38:05,709 --> 00:38:07,044
And if I don't permit this?

00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:10,113
We'll just hold your men
until we get a warrant.

00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:14,551
( <i>speaking Korean</i> )

00:38:14,618 --> 00:38:17,921
( <i>speaking Korean</i> )

00:38:17,988 --> 00:38:19,590
<i>Kamsahamnida.</i>

00:39:17,714 --> 00:39:21,618
WILLOWS:
<i>The bodyguards dragged Jeff</i>
<i>through the service corridor.</i>

00:39:24,655 --> 00:39:27,090
<i>Between the drugs</i>
<i>and the confidence,</i>

00:39:27,157 --> 00:39:28,258
<i>he must've put up</i>
<i>quite a fight.</i>

00:39:28,325 --> 00:39:29,526
Hey!

00:39:32,696 --> 00:39:34,565
Most likely, he was
still alive when they left.

00:39:34,631 --> 00:39:36,633
They probably thought they just
had taught him a lesson.

00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,836
They did:

00:39:38,902 --> 00:39:40,904
Don't confuse
fantasy with reality.

00:39:40,971 --> 00:39:44,074
SANDERS:
Well, hush money or
not, you have to admit

00:39:44,141 --> 00:39:48,011
that whole fantasy night thing
was a pretty cool gift

00:39:48,078 --> 00:39:50,013
from a very generous boss.

00:39:51,748 --> 00:39:53,684
Greg, don't you have
a birthday coming up?

00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:55,819
Why, yes, Sara, I do.

00:39:57,754 --> 00:39:59,523
I'm thinking ear-shredding rock,
a beautiful model,

00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:00,958
boatloads of sushi

00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:03,126
and latex.

00:40:03,193 --> 00:40:05,229
Eh, that was last year.

00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:09,666
I think fantasies
are best kept private.

00:40:09,733 --> 00:40:11,101
STOKES:
Hey.

00:40:11,168 --> 00:40:13,937
Want to know why Jeff left
the girl and went downstairs?

00:40:14,004 --> 00:40:15,606
Okay.

00:40:15,672 --> 00:40:17,941
This was dropped off
at the Palermo.

00:40:18,008 --> 00:40:20,177
Manager sent it over.

00:40:20,244 --> 00:40:22,813
Nice rocks.

00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,449
STOKES:
Jeff must have spent the ten G's
he won playing pool on it.

00:40:25,516 --> 00:40:28,151
Gift wrapped,
never picked it up.

00:40:28,218 --> 00:40:30,053
WILLOWS:
Yeah, there was
a jewelry store

00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,489
right across from
the service corridor entrance.

00:40:36,393 --> 00:40:38,562
Most I ever spent on a girl.

00:40:38,629 --> 00:40:41,565
Most I ever held
in my hand at one time.

00:40:45,402 --> 00:40:47,704
You know, the biggest fantasy
in Vegas

00:40:47,771 --> 00:40:50,240
is that everything here
happens by chance.

00:40:50,307 --> 00:40:52,843
Nothing here
happens by chance.

00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:55,445
The odds are set
before you get off the plane.

00:40:57,814 --> 00:41:00,050
You know, I'd settle
for a birthday breakfast.

00:41:00,117 --> 00:41:02,494
Now that is a fantasy.
