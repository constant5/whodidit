00:15:55,494 --> 00:15:58,063
Okay.

00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:59,999
Sorry about that, guys.
You had some questions?

00:16:00,065 --> 00:16:03,102
You placed an anonymous
911 call Sunday night.

00:16:03,169 --> 00:16:04,870
Said you were outside
the McBrides' house

00:16:04,937 --> 00:16:06,605
and you could see
blood in the entryway.

00:16:06,672 --> 00:16:08,440
SIDLE:
Right before that,

00:16:08,507 --> 00:16:11,177
you called Jude McBride's
cell phone three times.

00:16:11,243 --> 00:16:13,045
Late night house call...?

00:16:13,112 --> 00:16:15,214
Dennis, do I have
to answer that?

00:16:15,281 --> 00:16:17,249
It looks worse if you don't.

00:16:17,316 --> 00:16:21,987
Well, Jude and I have a standing
Sunday night appointment.

00:16:22,054 --> 00:16:23,589
For what?

00:16:24,857 --> 00:16:27,059
You are aware that it's illegal.

00:16:27,126 --> 00:16:31,096
Okay, look, I have no idea
what went on out there,

00:16:31,163 --> 00:16:32,765
before I got there.

00:16:32,832 --> 00:16:34,166
Hi, Jude, it's 8:00.

00:16:34,233 --> 00:16:35,501
Where are you guys?

00:16:35,568 --> 00:16:38,137
<i>I called 911.</i>

00:16:38,204 --> 00:16:40,406
I didn't leave my name,
because...

00:16:40,473 --> 00:16:42,508
because I didn't want to explain
what I was doing there.

00:16:42,575 --> 00:16:44,043
You and Jude are making me
look like an idiot.

00:16:44,109 --> 00:16:45,177
He's selling drugs,

00:16:45,244 --> 00:16:46,745
and you're buying them.

00:16:46,812 --> 00:16:48,147
Tell me something, Malcolm.

00:16:48,214 --> 00:16:50,216
Are you high when you
treat my daughter?

00:16:50,282 --> 00:16:52,284
Dennis, of course not.

00:16:52,351 --> 00:16:53,486
And Jude was discreet.

00:16:53,552 --> 00:16:55,788
He rarely sold
to anybody in town.

00:16:55,855 --> 00:16:58,023
He sent most of it out of state.

00:16:59,925 --> 00:17:01,327
Dr. Parker, what size shoes
do you wear?

00:17:01,393 --> 00:17:02,928
What size shoe do I wear?
A ten.

00:17:02,995 --> 00:17:04,763
And where were you Friday night?

00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:06,332
I was here, doing rounds.

00:17:11,437 --> 00:17:13,439
Hello, there.

00:17:13,506 --> 00:17:14,540
Hi.

00:17:14,607 --> 00:17:16,976
Can I help you?

00:17:17,042 --> 00:17:19,011
I'm Sage.

00:17:19,078 --> 00:17:20,579
I'm looking for Nina.

00:17:20,646 --> 00:17:22,481
Yeah? So am I.

00:17:22,548 --> 00:17:26,585
She left work early Friday
to see Jimmy Buffet in Tahoe.

00:17:26,652 --> 00:17:28,754
But then she never showed up
at the shop today.

00:17:28,821 --> 00:17:30,122
And what was your name again?

00:17:30,189 --> 00:17:31,223
Sage.
Sage.

00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:33,792
Okay, yeah, maybe you
can help me out.

00:17:33,859 --> 00:17:35,728
Um, the family,
what do you know about them?

00:17:35,794 --> 00:17:36,929
Are they having problems?

00:17:36,996 --> 00:17:39,298
Marital problems,
anything like that?

00:17:39,365 --> 00:17:40,533
Are you kidding?

00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:43,302
Jude and Nina had the
marriage we all wanted.

00:17:43,369 --> 00:17:44,770
Really?

00:17:45,871 --> 00:17:47,439
You know, uh,

00:17:47,506 --> 00:17:49,041
your third eye

00:17:49,108 --> 00:17:52,278
is so open right now.

00:17:52,344 --> 00:17:55,147
Are you having visions
or hearing voices?

00:17:55,214 --> 00:17:56,682
No.

00:17:56,749 --> 00:17:58,951
I'm really sorry.

00:17:59,018 --> 00:18:00,686
But you're radiating

00:18:00,753 --> 00:18:03,222
this crazy feminine energy.

00:18:03,289 --> 00:18:05,691
( <i>chuckling</i> ):
Really.
Mm-hmm.

00:18:05,758 --> 00:18:07,092
Do you believe in past lives?

00:18:07,159 --> 00:18:10,796
No, ma'am.
How come?

00:18:10,863 --> 00:18:14,667
Because I'm just trying
to make it through this one.

00:18:16,802 --> 00:18:19,705
I think you're doing
pretty well.

00:18:30,316 --> 00:18:31,884
Hey... Sage.

00:18:33,118 --> 00:18:35,120
Thanks.

00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:41,861
Hey, Nick.

00:18:41,927 --> 00:18:43,496
Well, there's no hits
off the fingerprints

00:18:43,562 --> 00:18:45,030
from the kitchen cabinets.

00:18:45,097 --> 00:18:47,299
Dozens of unknowns, none
of which were in the system--

00:18:47,366 --> 00:18:49,502
no work cards, no prior crime.

00:18:49,568 --> 00:18:52,471
So I expanded the search
to other databases,

00:18:52,538 --> 00:18:54,840
and I did get one hit.

00:18:54,907 --> 00:18:57,710
A Mark Horvatin.

00:18:57,776 --> 00:19:00,246
17 years old, Junior ROTC.

00:19:00,312 --> 00:19:02,181
His print was in the kitchen,
but not in blood.

00:19:02,248 --> 00:19:03,616
Could just be a friend.

00:19:05,684 --> 00:19:07,586
That was nice, dude.

00:19:07,653 --> 00:19:09,121
That was nice.
You got smoked.

00:19:09,188 --> 00:19:10,122
Hey, Mark!

00:19:10,189 --> 00:19:12,291
Mark!

00:19:13,192 --> 00:19:15,661
Hey, I'll catch up
with you guys later.

00:19:18,063 --> 00:19:19,565
Nice game Saturday.

00:19:19,632 --> 00:19:20,966
Hey, Dennis.

00:19:21,033 --> 00:19:22,735
Listen, we should probably
go with Sheriff Brackett

00:19:22,801 --> 00:19:23,802
on this one.

00:19:23,869 --> 00:19:26,138
Oh, okay, Sheriff.

00:19:26,205 --> 00:19:30,576
This is Mr. Stokes
from the Las Vegas Crime Lab.

00:19:33,078 --> 00:19:34,680
What size shoe
do you wear?

00:19:34,747 --> 00:19:36,015
Twelve.

00:19:36,081 --> 00:19:38,017
Can I see the bottom?

00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:40,019
Should I get my dad?

00:19:40,085 --> 00:19:42,855
No, we're just talking.

00:19:45,991 --> 00:19:47,693
Oh, yeah,

00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,861
they're new, huh?

00:19:48,928 --> 00:19:50,462
Yeah, I got them this weekend.

00:19:50,529 --> 00:19:53,399
My old ones were thrashed.
STOKES:
Huh.

00:19:54,466 --> 00:19:57,136
You know, when I played ball,

00:19:57,203 --> 00:19:58,804
I used to stick all
my gear in the trunk.

00:19:58,871 --> 00:20:00,639
Yeah, well, this is just easier.

00:20:00,706 --> 00:20:03,742
Parking lot still
school property?

00:20:03,809 --> 00:20:06,245
BRACKETT:
Yep.

00:20:06,312 --> 00:20:08,948
Why don't you go ahead
and pop the trunk for me?

00:20:10,049 --> 00:20:11,650
Go ahead.

00:20:29,468 --> 00:20:31,871
CASSIE ( <i>whispering</i> ):
<i>Daddy's garden was supposed</i>
<i>to be a secret.</i>

00:20:31,937 --> 00:20:35,441
<i>Someone must have told</i>
<i>the secret.</i>

00:20:37,076 --> 00:20:39,545
BRACKETT ( <i>over speaker</i> ):
This doesn't look good, Mark.

00:20:39,612 --> 00:20:41,881
Not a lot of places
you can get that much marijuana.

00:20:41,947 --> 00:20:44,083
There's no way
it could be a coincidence.

00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:47,486
Tell me where the bodies are.

00:20:51,757 --> 00:20:56,328
( <i>indistinct radio transmission</i>
<i>in distance</i> )

00:21:00,733 --> 00:21:03,402
I'm not finding any blood
in here.

00:21:03,469 --> 00:21:07,907
Besides, four bodies would
never fit inside this car.

00:21:07,973 --> 00:21:11,310
You know, maybe, the pot
was stolen after the fact.

00:21:11,377 --> 00:21:13,946
Crime of opportunity?

00:21:14,013 --> 00:21:15,815
What are you, his lawyer?

00:21:15,881 --> 00:21:17,249
Whoever stole the pot...

00:21:18,617 --> 00:21:20,719
...had a gun
and shot the lock

00:21:20,786 --> 00:21:22,388
off the basement door.

00:21:22,454 --> 00:21:27,092
Someone went to the ATM
at 10:03 Friday night.

00:21:27,159 --> 00:21:28,961
Right in the window
of the murders.

00:21:29,028 --> 00:21:31,130
Hand that over
to Sheriff Brackett.

00:21:31,197 --> 00:21:33,599
He can run the account number.

00:21:47,346 --> 00:21:50,516
I found this exact
kind of gum

00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:53,719
in the driveway
at the McBrides'.

00:21:53,786 --> 00:21:56,288
( <i>groans</i> )

00:21:56,355 --> 00:22:00,159
This microscope I got from
the high school is a joke.

00:22:00,226 --> 00:22:01,427
How am I ever going to prove

00:22:01,494 --> 00:22:03,028
that this is the pot
from the house?

00:22:04,263 --> 00:22:06,432
Where's that evidence
we collected?

00:22:20,646 --> 00:22:23,282
All right, this is the bag

00:22:23,349 --> 00:22:25,217
from the house.

00:22:26,318 --> 00:22:28,654
And this is the bag

00:22:28,721 --> 00:22:31,957
from the car.

00:22:33,325 --> 00:22:35,895
The striations line up.

00:22:35,961 --> 00:22:37,730
These bags
are from the same roll.

00:22:37,796 --> 00:22:38,831
Nicely done.

00:22:38,898 --> 00:22:39,832
STOKES:
Fellas.

00:22:39,899 --> 00:22:42,501
We have a little problem.

00:22:42,568 --> 00:22:45,371
Mark's not talking, not
even to pass the buck.

00:22:45,437 --> 00:22:47,973
And his dad, Mark Sr.,
is a lawyer,

00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,609
and he's challenging
our search and seizure,

00:22:50,676 --> 00:22:52,511
saying that even though
we were on school grounds,

00:22:52,578 --> 00:22:55,981
we lacked probable cause
to search personal property.

00:22:58,784 --> 00:23:00,753
( <i>strips off glove</i> )

00:23:06,574 --> 00:23:08,443
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:23:11,513 --> 00:23:14,783
Blood pool closest
to the front door,

00:23:14,849 --> 00:23:18,620
and the size nine-and-a-half
shoe print...

00:23:18,687 --> 00:23:21,556
both in Jeremy's blood.

00:23:23,892 --> 00:23:24,693
JUDE:
Jeremy, what's going on?

00:23:27,162 --> 00:23:29,631
WILLOWS:
<i>Jude stepped in Jeremy's blood.</i>

00:23:30,932 --> 00:23:32,334
Blood pool number two.

00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,668
In the hallway,

00:23:33,735 --> 00:23:36,104
<i>between the foyer</i>
<i>and the kitchen.</i>

00:23:36,171 --> 00:23:38,139
( <i>gunshot</i> )

00:23:39,307 --> 00:23:41,943
Nina's footprints,
dual contribution,

00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:44,412
Jeremy and Jude.

00:23:48,383 --> 00:23:51,820
Jude? Jeremy?
Is everything okay?

00:23:53,021 --> 00:23:54,522
Oh, my God!

00:23:54,589 --> 00:23:55,690
Oh, my God!

00:23:55,757 --> 00:23:56,558
Jeremy!

00:23:56,625 --> 00:23:58,893
( <i>sobbing</i> )

00:24:02,564 --> 00:24:04,833
WILLOWS:
<i>Blood pool number three...</i>

00:24:04,899 --> 00:24:06,868
( <i>Nina shrieks, body thuds</i> )

00:24:06,935 --> 00:24:08,236
<i>...Nina's blood.</i>

00:24:25,086 --> 00:24:28,356
Yeah, Nick,
I got the DNA results back.

00:24:28,423 --> 00:24:32,494
Blood pools were confirmed
for mom, dad and Jeremy.

00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,362
None of the blood was Cassie's,

00:24:34,429 --> 00:24:37,699
so either her death
was a bloodless crime...

00:24:37,766 --> 00:24:39,601
Or they took her alive.

00:24:39,668 --> 00:24:41,269
Thanks, Catherine.

00:24:41,336 --> 00:24:43,204
SIDLE:
How did Mark know
where the pot was,

00:24:43,271 --> 00:24:47,242
if McBride was as discreet
as Dr. Parker claims?

00:24:47,309 --> 00:24:50,979
DNA confirmed
to everyone but Cassie.

00:24:51,046 --> 00:24:51,980
SIDLE:
Interesting.

00:24:52,047 --> 00:24:53,014
Mm-hmm.

00:24:53,081 --> 00:24:54,449
Mark knew the
pot was there

00:24:54,516 --> 00:24:55,684
because of Jeremy.

00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:58,086
Come on, I'm sure
Jeremy wasn't voted

00:24:58,153 --> 00:24:59,354
the most popular
boy in school.

00:24:59,421 --> 00:25:00,422
He's done everyone's
term paper.

00:25:00,488 --> 00:25:01,523
He's a nerd.

00:25:01,589 --> 00:25:04,259
So you guys want
to come over and hang out?

00:25:04,326 --> 00:25:06,761
I could sell you some pot.

00:25:06,828 --> 00:25:09,197
Now, where are you
gonna score fresh herb?

00:25:09,264 --> 00:25:11,633
My parents are
going out of town.

00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,968
My dad has pounds of it.

00:25:13,034 --> 00:25:15,437
Yeah, so how does that end up
a quadruple murder?

00:25:15,503 --> 00:25:17,105
One of them was stupid enough
to bring a gun.

00:25:17,172 --> 00:25:18,840
I was talking to Tina
the other night.

00:25:18,907 --> 00:25:20,275
She said something
to make me think.

00:25:20,342 --> 00:25:21,810
( <i>playfully coughing</i> ):
Yoko Ono.

00:25:25,013 --> 00:25:27,582
Tina's dad is
a Doctor of Anthropology,

00:25:27,649 --> 00:25:30,385
so, one day, when she was
a little girl, she asked her dad

00:25:30,452 --> 00:25:32,621
where on her body
her anthropology was.

00:25:32,687 --> 00:25:35,123
You know, he's a doctor.

00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:38,126
Mark's dad's a lawyer.

00:25:38,193 --> 00:25:39,394
Maybe Mark was thinking
habeas corpus--

00:25:39,461 --> 00:25:40,895
"body of the crime"?

00:25:40,962 --> 00:25:43,465
"Body of the crime" is content
of the case, not an actual body.

00:25:43,531 --> 00:25:45,667
Yeah, but a kid could
easily misinterpret.

00:25:45,734 --> 00:25:47,135
Maybe he's thinking,
"no body, no crime,

00:25:47,202 --> 00:25:48,136
no crime, no punishment."

00:25:48,203 --> 00:25:50,171
Does Yoko Ono want a job?

00:25:52,707 --> 00:25:53,642
BRACKETT:
Morning.

00:25:53,708 --> 00:25:54,743
Morning.
Hello.

00:25:54,809 --> 00:25:55,977
My wife made muffins.

00:25:56,044 --> 00:25:56,978
Thank you.

00:25:57,045 --> 00:25:57,979
You're welcome.

00:25:58,046 --> 00:26:00,181
We got a lead on the ATM.

00:26:00,248 --> 00:26:01,783
The account belongs
to Jim Locke.

00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:04,152
He's got a son named Peter,
the same age as Mark.

00:26:04,219 --> 00:26:06,955
We pulled some
surveillance footage.

00:26:07,022 --> 00:26:08,957
It's a little grainy,
can't see much.

00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:10,158
I'll give it over to Archie

00:26:10,225 --> 00:26:11,826
and see if he can clean it up.
Thanks.

00:26:11,893 --> 00:26:13,628
All right,
I'll be in the car waiting

00:26:13,695 --> 00:26:14,829
when you guys are ready.

00:26:14,896 --> 00:26:15,830
All right,
thank you.

00:26:15,897 --> 00:26:17,332
You feeling a little
homesick there?

00:26:17,399 --> 00:26:18,533
You want to draw straws?

00:26:20,068 --> 00:26:21,036
No.

00:26:22,537 --> 00:26:24,005
Call me if you need me.

00:26:24,072 --> 00:26:26,007
All right.

00:26:26,074 --> 00:26:28,443
All right, let's head over
to Locke's house,

00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:29,878
and see what we can find.

00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:35,984
You coming?

00:26:36,051 --> 00:26:37,852
No... No, you go ahead,

00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:39,587
I'll catch up.

00:26:39,654 --> 00:26:40,655
You think she's alive.

00:26:42,257 --> 00:26:43,258
You don't?

00:26:44,859 --> 00:26:46,628
None of her blood
was found at the house.

00:26:46,695 --> 00:26:51,132
I think she was drugged, and...

00:26:51,199 --> 00:26:54,302
she was lucky
if all they did after that

00:26:54,369 --> 00:26:55,570
was kill her.

00:26:55,637 --> 00:26:57,405
I don't think she was drugged.

00:26:57,472 --> 00:26:58,773
She's a smart little girl.

00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,709
She hid that cough medicine
in her shoe;

00:27:00,775 --> 00:27:03,645
that's like hiding green beans
in your napkin, you know?

00:27:03,712 --> 00:27:05,180
I hope you're right.

00:27:05,246 --> 00:27:08,149
But <i>everything</i> in our experience
tells us they're dead,

00:27:08,216 --> 00:27:09,150
all four of them.

00:27:09,217 --> 00:27:10,986
Doesn't mean we just give up.

00:27:11,052 --> 00:27:12,721
No one's giving up.

00:27:12,787 --> 00:27:15,023
It's just that...

00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:16,925
you're acting like
you're going to rescue a person,

00:27:16,992 --> 00:27:19,260
not recover a body.

00:27:19,327 --> 00:27:21,262
And on this job...

00:27:21,329 --> 00:27:23,365
that's just not
usually the case.

00:27:26,534 --> 00:27:27,936
I was rescued.

00:27:29,671 --> 00:27:32,240
It was not your day to die.

00:27:32,307 --> 00:27:35,977
When it's your day,
it's your day, you know?

00:27:37,579 --> 00:27:40,148
I don't think
it was Cassie's day.

00:27:50,258 --> 00:27:51,459
That looks like
the plant material

00:27:51,526 --> 00:27:53,628
I found in
the McBrides' driveway.

00:27:53,695 --> 00:27:55,530
And this looks like
the same wheelbase

00:27:55,597 --> 00:27:56,998
as the tread you found.

00:27:58,533 --> 00:28:00,468
BRACKETT:
We found something in Mark's car

00:28:00,535 --> 00:28:02,470
that we <i>think</i>
might be Peter's.

00:28:02,537 --> 00:28:04,139
Is that your
account number?

00:28:04,205 --> 00:28:05,273
Yes.

00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,574
Does Peter have access to it?

00:28:07,275 --> 00:28:08,910
Sure.

00:28:08,977 --> 00:28:11,212
He has a limit,
but he's never gone over it.

00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:15,050
Mrs. Locke, when was the last
time you took the boat out?

00:28:15,116 --> 00:28:16,351
Friday night.

00:28:16,418 --> 00:28:17,585
Peter and some of
his friends

00:28:17,652 --> 00:28:19,020
took it out
for one last hurrah

00:28:19,087 --> 00:28:20,055
before it gets too cold.

00:28:20,121 --> 00:28:21,056
Do you know which friends?

00:28:21,122 --> 00:28:23,558
I was already in bed.
Sorry.

00:28:23,625 --> 00:28:26,828
Do you mind if the CSIs
take a look at it?

00:28:26,895 --> 00:28:28,063
Sure.

00:28:28,129 --> 00:28:30,932
Have the boys been drinking beer
on the boat again?

00:28:37,639 --> 00:28:41,309
( <i>children shouting happily</i>
<i>in distance</i> )

00:28:42,477 --> 00:28:46,681
( <i>dog barking</i> )

00:28:46,748 --> 00:28:50,085
( <i>kids laughing</i> )

00:29:03,798 --> 00:29:06,835
CASSIE ( <i>hoarse whisper</i> ):
<i>Everyone told me</i>
<i>I was the best Gretel ever.</i>

00:29:30,392 --> 00:29:32,794
SANDERS:
My dad used
to take me sailing

00:29:32,861 --> 00:29:34,062
when I was a kid.

00:29:34,129 --> 00:29:35,497
Do you know
what the inboard end

00:29:35,563 --> 00:29:37,399
of an anchor rope is called?

00:29:37,465 --> 00:29:38,466
"The bitter end."

00:29:46,608 --> 00:29:49,077
This explains why
we're not finding any blood.

00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:02,357
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

00:30:02,424 --> 00:30:03,358
Hey!

00:30:03,425 --> 00:30:04,492
STOKES:
Hey!

00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,962
Sara, did you find any gum
on that boat?

00:30:07,028 --> 00:30:09,731
Any gum at all--
wrapped, unwrapped-- anywhere?

00:30:09,798 --> 00:30:11,166
Yeah...

00:30:11,232 --> 00:30:12,467
How did you know that?

00:30:12,534 --> 00:30:14,169
I think Cassie
was on that boat--

00:30:14,235 --> 00:30:16,438
alive.

00:30:16,504 --> 00:30:18,406
I think she was
leaving us a trail...

00:30:18,473 --> 00:30:19,841
of gum, "gum drops."

00:30:19,908 --> 00:30:24,012
In the driveway,
in the car, on the boat.

00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:25,447
It's like Hansel and Gretel.

00:30:25,513 --> 00:30:28,116
Half the pictures I've seen
her in, she's chewing gum.

00:30:28,183 --> 00:30:29,584
Nick, that's a bit of a stretch.

00:30:29,651 --> 00:30:31,186
A lot of people chew gum.

00:30:31,252 --> 00:30:33,622
You tell Sheriff Brackett
I'll meet you at the station.

00:30:33,688 --> 00:30:35,824
Peter, we know
you were in Mark's car.

00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:37,559
We found
your ATM receipt.

00:30:37,626 --> 00:30:41,062
We also know you guys took
the boat out Friday night.

00:30:41,129 --> 00:30:44,933
( <i>on speaker</i> ):
We know that there were
three people involved.

00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,135
Who was the third?

00:30:49,471 --> 00:30:51,773
Pete, we found your print
on a cough syrup bottle,

00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,274
underneath
Cassie McBride's bed.

00:30:57,712 --> 00:30:59,614
Your buddy Mark's not talking.

00:30:59,681 --> 00:31:00,982
He's gonna pay for that.

00:31:01,049 --> 00:31:03,118
Be smarter.

00:31:03,184 --> 00:31:05,787
Do the right thing.

00:31:10,892 --> 00:31:12,327
( <i>computer beeping</i> )

00:31:36,551 --> 00:31:37,552
( <i>computer beeps</i> )

00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,162
Dead bodies
don't suck their thumbs.

00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:51,299
( <i>PDA beeping</i> )

00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:16,358
How'd you hurt
your hand?

00:32:16,424 --> 00:32:18,126
What's the matter?
She fight back?

00:32:18,193 --> 00:32:19,494
You tried to drug her,
but guess what?

00:32:19,561 --> 00:32:20,695
She was too smart
for you.

00:32:20,762 --> 00:32:22,030
You coached
the little girls' swim team,

00:32:22,097 --> 00:32:23,365
'cause you liked
to watch 'em

00:32:23,431 --> 00:32:25,000
in their bathing suits,
is that it?

00:32:25,066 --> 00:32:27,602
You're gonna answer me
right now!

00:32:27,669 --> 00:32:31,206
No more screwing around!
Where is she?!

00:32:32,207 --> 00:32:33,541
Where is she?

00:32:35,443 --> 00:32:36,678
Where is she?

00:32:45,573 --> 00:32:47,508
STOKES:
Okay, my guess

00:32:47,575 --> 00:32:49,744
is the guys stopped
at the ATM to get cash for gas.

00:32:49,811 --> 00:32:51,112
That's cash only,
and Eddie over there says

00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:53,314
he filled the tank
to the top Friday night.

00:32:53,381 --> 00:32:55,049
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

00:32:55,116 --> 00:32:56,551
Sure, what's up?

00:32:56,617 --> 00:32:58,719
I think I need to talk about
what happened at the station.

00:32:58,786 --> 00:33:01,556
Oh, yeah.

00:33:01,622 --> 00:33:04,192
I'm slightly concerned about
its effect on the case,

00:33:04,258 --> 00:33:05,660
but more than that,
I'm concerned about

00:33:05,726 --> 00:33:07,028
the case's effect on you, Nick,

00:33:07,094 --> 00:33:10,798
and I'm absolutely sure
that, six months ago,

00:33:10,865 --> 00:33:12,366
you wouldn't have
lost it like that.

00:33:12,433 --> 00:33:14,468
I know, I'm sorry.

00:33:14,535 --> 00:33:16,237
I apologize for that.

00:33:16,304 --> 00:33:18,973
How much gas was left?

00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,475
Three-quarters of a tank.

00:33:20,541 --> 00:33:23,211
Took an eighth to get out
there, an eighth to get back,

00:33:23,277 --> 00:33:24,545
and according
to the gas mileage,

00:33:24,612 --> 00:33:26,547
on the Lockes' boat,

00:33:26,614 --> 00:33:28,382
that would have been
about three miles out

00:33:28,449 --> 00:33:30,318
from this launch point

00:33:30,384 --> 00:33:31,819
right here.

00:33:31,886 --> 00:33:33,187
Come on.

00:33:34,689 --> 00:33:37,024
Nick?

00:33:37,091 --> 00:33:38,125
Yeah?

00:33:55,943 --> 00:33:57,945
This is the three-mile mark.

00:34:25,306 --> 00:34:30,144
CASSIE ( <i>quietly</i> ):
<i>I used to love going</i>
<i>to the lake,</i>

00:34:30,211 --> 00:34:32,947
<i>but not anymore.</i>

00:34:47,061 --> 00:34:49,030
There's something there.

00:35:00,975 --> 00:35:05,179
<i>They killed my whole family.</i>

00:35:16,691 --> 00:35:18,259
( <i>camera clicking rapidly</i> )

00:35:27,735 --> 00:35:29,770
Where's the fourth?

00:35:29,837 --> 00:35:31,973
We only found three.

00:35:35,009 --> 00:35:36,777
C.O.D.?

00:35:36,844 --> 00:35:38,346
Gunshot wound to the chest.

00:35:38,412 --> 00:35:39,614
Though it appears

00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,283
to have gone
through his hand first.

00:35:43,317 --> 00:35:45,820
Dad wrestled with the gun, huh?

00:35:47,522 --> 00:35:48,489
( <i>gunshot</i> )

00:35:48,556 --> 00:35:50,224
Anything else?

00:35:50,291 --> 00:35:52,160
Contact wound
on the boy.

00:35:52,226 --> 00:35:54,729
Shot up-close
and personal.

00:35:54,795 --> 00:35:57,064
Mom was shot twice
in the back.

00:35:57,131 --> 00:35:58,599
Not up-close.

00:36:00,201 --> 00:36:02,770
Rinsed and ready for you.

00:36:07,241 --> 00:36:10,545
.22... probably
from a revolver.

00:36:10,611 --> 00:36:12,947
Six shots.

00:36:13,014 --> 00:36:14,916
Four in the bodies,
two in the lock.

00:36:14,982 --> 00:36:16,818
Well, that would explain
why we didn't find

00:36:16,884 --> 00:36:18,152
Cassie's blood in the house.

00:36:18,219 --> 00:36:19,487
They ran out of bullets.

00:36:20,988 --> 00:36:22,523
Sara, the bullets pulled
from the bodies

00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:24,225
were from
a .22-caliber revolver.

00:36:24,292 --> 00:36:26,227
IBIS bounced back a hit.

00:36:26,294 --> 00:36:28,796
They were entered into IBIS from
the Department of Wildlife,

00:36:28,863 --> 00:36:31,532
for shooting a deer
with a small caliber handgun.

00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:33,267
Firearm was returned
to the owner--

00:36:33,334 --> 00:36:36,270
a Chris Daniels from Pioche,
Nevada.

00:36:36,337 --> 00:36:39,273
( <i>sports broadcast playing</i> )

00:36:43,144 --> 00:36:44,846
Hey, Dennis, what's up?

00:36:44,912 --> 00:36:46,247
Hey, just in time
for steaks.

00:36:46,314 --> 00:36:50,551
Mr. Daniels, do you, uh...
do you own a .22 revolver?

00:36:50,618 --> 00:36:52,119
You know the answer to that.

00:36:52,186 --> 00:36:55,556
You cited it and fined me
two hunting seasons ago.

00:36:55,623 --> 00:36:58,025
Sir, I'm Sara Sidle from
the Las Vegas Crime Lab.

00:36:58,092 --> 00:37:01,696
It's evidence in a
homicide investigation.

00:37:01,762 --> 00:37:02,864
I'm going to need it.

00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:04,665
Dad, how long on the steaks?

00:37:04,732 --> 00:37:07,668
We're going to need
to speak to Luke.

00:37:07,735 --> 00:37:09,337
What did you do with my gun?

00:37:10,905 --> 00:37:12,340
If you did anything
to jeopardize

00:37:12,406 --> 00:37:13,508
that football scholarship
of yours,

00:37:13,574 --> 00:37:14,809
you're done.

00:37:33,961 --> 00:37:35,863
BRACKETT:
Duck your head.

00:37:41,536 --> 00:37:43,504
Found this in his pocket

00:37:43,571 --> 00:37:45,173
when I patted him down.

00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:47,909
Tested positive for blood.

00:37:49,076 --> 00:37:50,444
As did these.

00:38:14,735 --> 00:38:18,606
You just wanted to
intimidate Jeremy, right?

00:38:18,673 --> 00:38:20,308
Scare him a little?

00:38:24,745 --> 00:38:29,584
But Mr. McBride was still home
and he didn't scare so easily.

00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:31,786
You guys have to go.
My parents are still home.

00:38:31,853 --> 00:38:33,721
Dude, I thought you said
there were pounds of pot.

00:38:33,788 --> 00:38:35,256
You guys got to get out, okay?

00:38:35,323 --> 00:38:37,091
Please, just get out
of here, all right?

00:38:37,158 --> 00:38:39,727
Jeremy! Jeremy,
what's going on?
What the heck?

00:38:39,794 --> 00:38:41,162
Jeremy, what's going on?

00:38:43,965 --> 00:38:45,700
( <i>gunshot</i> )

00:38:45,766 --> 00:38:47,401
What the hell did you just do?

00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:51,239
Mrs. McBride
came downstairs,

00:38:51,305 --> 00:38:52,974
so you had to
shoot her, too.

00:38:55,543 --> 00:38:57,645
Peter went upstairs
to deal with Cassie...

00:39:01,048 --> 00:39:04,152
...while you and
Mark bagged the pot

00:39:04,218 --> 00:39:07,155
and wrapped the bodies
in garbage bags.

00:39:07,221 --> 00:39:10,992
But... Peter couldn't do it.

00:39:13,794 --> 00:39:16,330
He couldn't kill Cassie...

00:39:17,365 --> 00:39:21,102
...so he tried
to drug her.

00:39:21,169 --> 00:39:23,471
You guys got
in Mark's car,

00:39:23,538 --> 00:39:26,707
you went to the ATM,
you got cash,

00:39:26,774 --> 00:39:28,442
you picked up
Peter's boat,

00:39:28,509 --> 00:39:29,811
you went back
to the McBrides'

00:39:29,877 --> 00:39:31,546
and you loaded the
bodies onto the boat.

Bring her over here.
No!

She can identify us!
There's no way

she's staying alive.

00:39:49,697 --> 00:39:51,999
I said she was a strong swimmer.

00:39:52,066 --> 00:39:54,502
I didn't say we could throw
a drugged ten-year-old

00:39:54,569 --> 00:39:55,570
into the lake.

00:40:01,776 --> 00:40:03,845
Did it make you feel like a man?
