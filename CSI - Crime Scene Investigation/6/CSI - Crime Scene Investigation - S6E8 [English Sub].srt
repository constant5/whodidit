00:00:07,625 --> 00:00:09,126
REPORTER:
<i>This is Channel 8 News</i>
<i>reporting with an update</i>

00:00:09,193 --> 00:00:11,795
<i>to yesterday's wild police</i>
<i>pursuit and shootout</i>

00:00:11,862 --> 00:00:14,031
<i>where three suspects</i>
<i>and one police officer</i>

00:00:14,098 --> 00:00:17,067
<i>were killed by gunfire</i>
<i>at Third and Jefferson.</i>

00:00:17,134 --> 00:00:19,103
<i>Shortly after being taken</i>
<i>into custody,</i>

00:00:19,169 --> 00:00:20,504
<i>Jose Fausto, the last suspect</i>

00:00:20,571 --> 00:00:23,540
<i>was gunned down</i>
<i>by an unknown...</i>

00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:25,576
( <i>gunshot</i> )
( <i>prisoner screams</i> )

00:00:25,643 --> 00:00:27,544
Down! Everybody down! Down!

00:00:28,746 --> 00:00:30,414
CAVALIERE:
Somebody shot this guy

00:00:30,481 --> 00:00:32,750
in front of all these cops?

00:00:32,816 --> 00:00:35,786
They did not want him
talking to us.

00:00:35,853 --> 00:00:38,789
This was not some
doped up drive-by.

00:00:38,856 --> 00:00:39,857
The shooter had skill.

00:00:39,924 --> 00:00:42,126
Just one shot went through
the ten ring.

00:00:42,192 --> 00:00:44,929
How'd they know
Fausto was here?

00:00:44,995 --> 00:00:46,797
I don't know.

00:00:46,864 --> 00:00:48,565
I bet you he tried to reach out
for help, you know?

00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:50,935
Maybe money or a ticket
out of here.

00:00:51,001 --> 00:00:52,236
I'll check the phone records

00:00:52,303 --> 00:00:53,904
and see if there was any calls
in or out.

00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:55,973
Glad I'm not Vartann.

00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,141
He's got to tell
the UnderSheriff.

00:00:57,207 --> 00:00:59,476
MCKEEN:
<i>Are you seriously</i>

00:00:59,543 --> 00:01:01,979
telling me
our only live suspect,

00:01:02,046 --> 00:01:04,081
a cop killer, was gunned
down in your custody?

00:01:04,148 --> 00:01:05,382
I'm sorry
to say yes, sir.

00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:06,650
And you didn't catch
the shooter?

00:01:06,717 --> 00:01:07,685
That's also correct, sir.

00:01:07,751 --> 00:01:08,819
Stop calling me sir,

00:01:08,886 --> 00:01:10,588
you worthless...
( <i>sighs)</i>

00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:12,756
Where's Grissom?

00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:13,691
ECKLIE:
He's on his way.

00:01:13,757 --> 00:01:14,792
All right, let's start
without him.

00:01:14,858 --> 00:01:16,260
ORTEGA:
Sergeant Adams and Officer Bell

00:01:16,327 --> 00:01:19,163
were making a routine traffic
stop on a Buick.

00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:21,065
Before they were able
to effect the stop,

00:01:21,131 --> 00:01:23,067
a stolen Caprice intervened.

00:01:23,133 --> 00:01:26,036
<i>Adams said they just cut him</i>
<i>off and started firing.</i>

00:01:27,571 --> 00:01:30,608
<i>They were followed in pursuit</i>
<i>by officers Davis and Carroll</i>

00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:31,976
<i>and detectives Brass</i>
<i>and Curtis.</i>

00:01:32,042 --> 00:01:34,511
The, uh, Caprice TC'd
during the pursuit.

00:01:39,249 --> 00:01:40,718
<i>And they just kept firing.</i>

00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:43,988
We got three of them
off of prints.

00:01:44,054 --> 00:01:46,190
Priors for narcotics
and connections

00:01:46,257 --> 00:01:47,458
to the Mexican Mafia.

00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:50,094
And additional set of prints
from the Caprice

00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,996
came back to Jose Fausto,

00:01:52,062 --> 00:01:53,631
the guy shot
at the motel.

00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:54,932
I've heard enough about him.

00:01:54,999 --> 00:01:57,568
Why would these knuckleheads
pull in front of a police car

00:01:57,635 --> 00:01:59,970
making a traffic stop
and engage us in a gunfight?

00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:01,505
If the Buick was moving drugs,

00:02:01,572 --> 00:02:03,841
maybe the Caprice was providing
security,

00:02:03,907 --> 00:02:05,876
keeping the cops
and rival gang members away.

00:02:05,943 --> 00:02:07,144
We don't have the Buick,

00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:08,712
so there's no evidence
to confirm that.

00:02:08,779 --> 00:02:10,748
Well, if these guys were a bunch
of drug-dealing thugs,

00:02:10,814 --> 00:02:12,182
why on the news
were they unarmed

00:02:12,249 --> 00:02:13,684
and we shot 'em
in the back?

00:02:13,751 --> 00:02:15,586
'Cause that's what
the eyewitnesses are saying.

00:02:17,454 --> 00:02:19,223
And that we shot
an innocent high school kid

00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:20,591
riding his bike.

00:02:22,693 --> 00:02:27,164
Uh, Ricardo Estevez,
male Hispanic, 22,

00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:29,900
shot in the alley east of Third.

00:02:29,967 --> 00:02:33,470
<i>Three entrance wounds to the</i>
<i>front torso, none to the back.</i>

00:02:33,537 --> 00:02:37,641
Ballistics matched the bullets
to Sergeant Carroll's gun.

00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:40,411
Recovered a .45 auto
next to the body.

00:02:40,477 --> 00:02:44,048
ORTEGA:
Captain Brass states the suspect
had it pointed at the sergeant

00:02:44,114 --> 00:02:45,516
when he came around
the corner.

00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:46,850
We have eyewitnesses

00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:49,186
who claim that they saw the
suspect with his hands raised

00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:50,421
<i>just before he was shot.</i>

00:02:51,889 --> 00:02:53,257
Can we resolve this?

00:02:53,324 --> 00:02:55,693
Sergeant Carroll

00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:58,629
partially confirms
eyewitness accounts.

00:02:58,696 --> 00:03:01,031
When Captain Brass approached,

00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:03,400
he momentarily took his eyes
off the suspect.

00:03:03,467 --> 00:03:05,936
When he looked back,
the suspect was holding a gun.

00:03:06,003 --> 00:03:07,438
Probably pulled it
from his waistband.

00:03:07,504 --> 00:03:08,606
There's no evidence

00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:10,774
to place the gun in the
suspect's hand at that point.

00:03:10,841 --> 00:03:12,309
What about the guy
in the other alley?

00:03:13,677 --> 00:03:19,984
Salvador Rosario, 19,
also shot in the front.

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,822
Autopsy's pending.

00:03:24,888 --> 00:03:29,560
Chemical tests show
that he held a gun.

00:03:29,627 --> 00:03:31,895
You're not going
to believe this.

00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:37,401
A bullet from Officer Davis'
gun hit the suspect's revolver,

00:03:37,468 --> 00:03:38,569
jamming the cylinder.

00:03:38,636 --> 00:03:40,104
That would mean the revolver

00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,239
had to be pointing
at Officer Davis.

00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:45,709
There are several eyewitnesses
who claim that they saw him

00:03:45,776 --> 00:03:47,111
plant the gun on the body.

00:03:47,177 --> 00:03:48,779
It wasn't planted.
It was mishandled.

00:03:48,846 --> 00:03:50,114
Mishandled by who?

00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,548
Contrary to policy,

00:03:51,615 --> 00:03:54,551
Officer Davis prematurely
picked up the gun.

00:03:54,618 --> 00:03:56,186
<i>Detective Curtis instructed him</i>

00:03:56,253 --> 00:03:58,188
<i>to set it back down,</i>
 <i>which he did.</i>

00:03:58,255 --> 00:03:59,390
What are you doing?
Put it down.

00:03:59,456 --> 00:04:01,425
Sorry, I was just trying
to secure his gun.

00:04:01,492 --> 00:04:03,160
An eyewitness seeing that

00:04:03,227 --> 00:04:05,763
certainly could misinterpret it
as planting a gun.

00:04:08,565 --> 00:04:12,903
MCKEEN:
Please tell me you've got some
good news.

00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:17,341
I have the autopsy findings
on Leandro Chavez.

00:04:17,408 --> 00:04:19,343
He died of survivable wounds.

00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:20,744
Bled out

00:04:20,811 --> 00:04:22,947
at the crime scene
waiting for transport.

00:04:24,615 --> 00:04:26,750
<i>Dame una ambulanica quey.</i>

00:04:26,817 --> 00:04:27,985
I don't speak Spanish.

00:04:28,052 --> 00:04:29,453
There's justification for this.

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,322
I can't wait to hear
what that is.

00:04:31,388 --> 00:04:34,058
Paramedics prioritized
transport of the injured.

00:04:34,124 --> 00:04:35,593
Downed officer first,

00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:36,660
civilians next.

00:04:36,727 --> 00:04:38,429
By the time
they got to the suspect,

00:04:38,495 --> 00:04:40,264
he'd passed on.

00:04:40,331 --> 00:04:42,633
Just a little retroactive
birth control.

00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,802
See, this is the problem
that the community

00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:46,170
has with us.

00:04:46,236 --> 00:04:48,539
You don't speak Spanish, so you
think they don't speak English

00:04:48,606 --> 00:04:49,873
and then when you run
your mouth...

00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,208
All right, keep on point here.

00:04:52,242 --> 00:04:55,346
Which one of these buttheads
shot Officer Bell?

00:04:55,412 --> 00:04:58,282
We have reason to believe
that Officer Bell

00:04:58,349 --> 00:05:00,184
was killed by friendly fire.

00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,553
( <i>gunshots</i> )

00:05:03,587 --> 00:05:05,055
It was a through-and-through,

00:05:05,122 --> 00:05:06,991
and we haven't recovered
the bullet yet.

00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:08,158
It's a big crime scene.

00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:09,660
Unacceptable.

00:05:09,727 --> 00:05:11,996
Get back out there
and find that bullet.

00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:13,564
I don't care
if it takes everybody you got

00:05:13,631 --> 00:05:14,832
working around the clock.

00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:17,434
I said we haven't found it <i>yet.</i>

00:05:17,501 --> 00:05:20,037
I didn't say we weren't looking.

to find that bullet.

00:05:55,461 --> 00:05:56,996
Don't worry
about the overtime.

00:05:57,063 --> 00:05:59,098
As soon as day shift
comes in,

00:05:59,165 --> 00:06:00,299
I'll send them
out, too.

00:06:00,366 --> 00:06:01,400
Hey, Grissom.

00:06:01,467 --> 00:06:03,336
So Warrick recovered
a nine-millimeter pistol

00:06:03,402 --> 00:06:06,539
from Fausto's motel room,
and I matched it to the
cartridge case

00:06:06,606 --> 00:06:07,873
from the kid
in the hospital.

00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,675
I also found
the kid's bike there.

00:06:10,977 --> 00:06:15,147
Shot him in the back
for his bike. Great.

00:06:15,214 --> 00:06:16,449
Hey.

00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:19,752
I left you a couple of messages.

00:06:19,819 --> 00:06:23,189
Oh, yeah... I haven't
gotten to them yet.

00:06:23,256 --> 00:06:24,757
Sorry.

00:06:24,824 --> 00:06:26,425
You're on administrative leave,
though.

00:06:26,492 --> 00:06:27,927
You should be home
getting some rest.

00:06:27,994 --> 00:06:29,595
Yeah, I tried.

00:06:29,662 --> 00:06:32,932
But I...

00:06:32,999 --> 00:06:37,103
can't stop thinking about
this... this Bell shooting.

00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:39,872
It's understandable.

00:06:39,939 --> 00:06:42,642
Grissom, I think
there may be a possibility

00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:46,979
that maybe... I shot him.

00:06:47,046 --> 00:06:51,217
Sofia... we can't discuss
the investigation.

00:06:51,284 --> 00:06:53,786
It's, it's something I remember
when I was giving my statement.

00:06:53,853 --> 00:06:54,587
Then it's already
on the record.

00:06:54,654 --> 00:06:55,655
No, something
I didn't mention.

00:06:55,721 --> 00:06:56,322
Sofia...

00:06:56,389 --> 00:06:57,356
Please listen to me.

00:06:59,225 --> 00:07:03,496
Bell was between me
and the suspect.

00:07:03,562 --> 00:07:07,333
I was shooting over his cover,
which is a violation of policy.

00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:15,107
I was, I was just trying
to stay alive.

00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:17,343
But if I did it, I...

00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:19,779
Hey, Grissom,
I have a question.

00:07:21,147 --> 00:07:22,782
Sofia?

00:07:24,317 --> 00:07:26,752
You're on administrative leave.

00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:28,421
I know.

00:07:28,487 --> 00:07:29,589
You should not be
in this building.

00:07:29,655 --> 00:07:31,324
I was just talking to a friend.

00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,391
If I can't talk to a friend,

00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:34,026
who the hell am I supposed
to talk to?

00:07:34,093 --> 00:07:35,995
Any friend outside
the department.

00:07:36,062 --> 00:07:38,764
And how many friends outside
of work do you have, Sarah?

00:07:38,831 --> 00:07:40,800
Maybe I should go
talk to my mother.

00:07:40,866 --> 00:07:42,168
Oh, no, sorry. I forgot.
She's a cop, too.

00:07:42,234 --> 00:07:44,637
I can recommend a departmental
psychologist.

00:07:52,878 --> 00:07:53,846
All right, then.

00:07:53,913 --> 00:07:56,882
This was a really bad idea.
I'm sorry.

00:08:17,103 --> 00:08:18,638
Hey, listen.

00:08:18,704 --> 00:08:20,840
One of the officers
searching for the shooter

00:08:20,907 --> 00:08:23,843
found an expended cartridge
up there on the seventh floor.

00:08:28,915 --> 00:08:30,583
That would put him
in the right position.

00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:31,817
Freemont Street's not far.

00:08:31,884 --> 00:08:33,386
It makes
for an easy escape.

00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,194
Good job.

00:08:55,841 --> 00:08:57,677
Nice.

00:09:14,594 --> 00:09:17,530
.223 Remington.

00:09:17,597 --> 00:09:19,265
Most likely from a semiauto.

00:09:19,332 --> 00:09:20,633
Didn't even bother
to pick it up.

00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,069
Yeah. Wasn't afraid
of getting caught.

00:09:23,135 --> 00:09:27,039
I'll give it to Bobby.
Have him run it through IBIS.

00:09:27,106 --> 00:09:29,408
See if the gun was used before.

00:09:29,475 --> 00:09:32,612
( <i>over radio</i> ):
Vartann, this is Cavaliere.

00:09:32,678 --> 00:09:35,581
We've recovered an expended
.223 cartridge case

00:09:35,648 --> 00:09:38,050
from a building
overlooking the motel.

00:09:38,117 --> 00:09:40,319
It's on its way
to the lab now.

00:09:40,386 --> 00:09:41,687
Scene here is secure.

00:09:41,754 --> 00:09:43,055
Patrol just called.

00:09:43,122 --> 00:09:47,360
They found a 411-A behind
5203 Maryland Parkway.

00:09:47,426 --> 00:09:49,262
Sounds like it might be
the Buick Regal.

00:09:49,328 --> 00:09:50,963
I'm going
to head over there now.

00:09:55,401 --> 00:09:58,237
CAVALIERE:
Buick Regal, no plates.

00:09:58,304 --> 00:10:00,306
You run the VIN?

00:10:00,373 --> 00:10:02,441
Yeah. It came
up stolen.

00:10:02,508 --> 00:10:05,511
Yeah. It's a good chance this
is the car we're looking for.

00:10:08,681 --> 00:10:10,283
Yep.

00:10:10,349 --> 00:10:12,151
Torched it to destroy
any evidence.

00:10:12,218 --> 00:10:15,788
Let's get this thing
towed back to the lab, okay?

00:10:15,855 --> 00:10:17,456
You got it.

00:10:17,523 --> 00:10:20,326
ORTEGA:
Sergeant Adams,
this is your standard

00:10:20,393 --> 00:10:22,528
after-shooting walk through,
okay?

00:10:22,595 --> 00:10:24,196
Now I want you to describe to us

00:10:24,263 --> 00:10:26,165
exactly what happened
yesterday morning.

00:10:26,232 --> 00:10:29,001
We were southbound
on Roosevelt.

00:10:29,068 --> 00:10:31,737
Bell observed a male
and female Hispanic

00:10:31,804 --> 00:10:34,340
having a domestic
dispute.

00:10:34,407 --> 00:10:35,908
Where were they?

00:10:35,975 --> 00:10:37,209
Over in that last spot.

00:10:37,276 --> 00:10:40,379
<i>They got out</i>
<i>of a green Geo Metro.</i>

00:10:40,446 --> 00:10:42,815
<i>Walked this way.</i>
<i>By the time we'd turned</i>
<i>around,</i>

00:10:42,882 --> 00:10:44,684
<i>they'd gotten</i>
<i>into the Buick Regal.</i>

00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,752
They were driving away.

00:10:46,819 --> 00:10:49,088
She was pregnant,
about to pop,

00:10:49,155 --> 00:10:50,156
just like Bell's wife.

00:10:50,222 --> 00:10:51,457
He said we should
pull 'em over.

00:10:51,524 --> 00:10:52,892
Which way'd they go?

00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,461
Southbound on Roosevelt.

00:10:55,528 --> 00:10:58,097
As soon as we turned
on Desert Springs,

00:10:58,164 --> 00:10:59,465
the Caprice cut us off.

00:10:59,532 --> 00:11:00,466
Okay, thanks.

00:11:00,533 --> 00:11:02,535
Hey, hang around
for about a minute
or two, okay?

00:11:02,602 --> 00:11:03,669
I'll give you
a ride home.

00:11:05,438 --> 00:11:06,806
Your thoughts?

00:11:06,872 --> 00:11:08,341
I wonder if that camera works.

00:11:10,776 --> 00:11:12,078
Well, it's worth checking out.

00:11:12,144 --> 00:11:13,512
Come on. I'll even let you
buy me a donut.

00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:40,172
I got to the end
of my road.

00:11:40,239 --> 00:11:42,942
And?
Well, the suspect
started shooting

00:11:43,009 --> 00:11:45,144
near the intersection
of Jefferson and Desert Springs.

00:11:45,211 --> 00:11:49,148
That's nearly 20 blocks north
of the crime scene.

00:11:49,215 --> 00:11:50,850
All ammo evidence was

00:11:50,917 --> 00:11:52,919
7.62-millimeter
casings and bullets.

00:11:52,985 --> 00:11:54,353
Only AK ammo?

00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,689
No police cartridge cases
or bullets?

00:11:56,756 --> 00:11:58,858
Not one out of 233 items.

00:11:58,925 --> 00:12:00,760
But cops don't get
to shoot car-to-car,

00:12:00,826 --> 00:12:02,395
only bad guys do, right?

00:12:05,598 --> 00:12:07,600
Oh, hey, Greg.
Been on vacation?

00:12:08,935 --> 00:12:11,037
Look, I know the undersheriff's
on your back,

00:12:11,103 --> 00:12:13,205
so I figured I better
get to you quick.

00:12:13,272 --> 00:12:14,907
Okay, you got to me.

00:12:14,974 --> 00:12:18,044
Found red clay chips and dust

00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:21,314
in the gouges
on Ricardo Estevez's .45.

00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,815
He was the guy

00:12:22,882 --> 00:12:24,750
that was in the east alley
with Brass.

00:12:24,817 --> 00:12:26,285
Red clay chips?

00:12:26,352 --> 00:12:28,955
Traces consistent with
roof tiles and clay pots.

00:12:29,021 --> 00:12:30,623
Who keeps their gun
in a clay pot?

00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:32,825
That would be no one.

00:12:32,892 --> 00:12:34,827
Trace evidence is fresh,

00:12:34,894 --> 00:12:37,129
so it definitely
came from the alley.

00:12:37,196 --> 00:12:40,499
In a crisis, you can
always count on me.

00:12:43,869 --> 00:12:45,805
Doesn't he bug you?

00:12:45,871 --> 00:12:48,808
No more so than anyone else
around here.

00:13:18,104 --> 00:13:21,841
Sara, will you come with me
to the east alley, please?

00:13:21,908 --> 00:13:24,143
I thought my top priority
as per the undersheriff

00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:26,012
was finding the bullet
that went through Bell.

00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:27,179
Well, this is per me.

00:13:27,246 --> 00:13:29,181
Come on.
It'll be fun.

00:13:29,248 --> 00:13:30,883
Okay.

00:13:44,864 --> 00:13:46,465
Sara?
Yeah?

00:13:46,532 --> 00:13:48,234
Call Hodges at the lab.

00:13:48,301 --> 00:13:51,003
Have him bring
two exemplar .45s out here.

00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:54,206
I'll get Ortega to bring
Brass and Sergeant Carroll.

00:13:54,273 --> 00:13:57,176
Are... you gonna tell me
what's going on?

00:13:57,243 --> 00:14:00,613
What goes up... must come down.

00:14:05,834 --> 00:14:08,303
So, where exactly
was Estevez standing

00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:10,939
when you guys saw him?
Right there,

00:14:11,005 --> 00:14:12,674
facing this way.
That's right.

00:14:12,741 --> 00:14:15,176
And he had a gun in his hand.
He had a gun
in his hand.

00:14:15,243 --> 00:14:16,811
And I shot a, uh,
armed suspect

00:14:16,878 --> 00:14:18,480
who'd been shooting
at the police, sir.

00:14:18,546 --> 00:14:19,881
I believe you.

00:14:19,948 --> 00:14:22,450
But the witnesses
may also be right.

00:14:22,517 --> 00:14:24,352
Look, don't make this
some intellectual exercise

00:14:24,419 --> 00:14:25,987
for your own
personal amusement.

00:14:26,054 --> 00:14:28,390
Check it out.
Hodges, stand over here.

00:14:28,456 --> 00:14:29,524
Yes, sir.

00:14:29,591 --> 00:14:30,925
Right here.

00:14:30,992 --> 00:14:32,193
See that roof?

00:14:34,863 --> 00:14:35,797
It's red clay.

00:14:35,864 --> 00:14:38,299
Toss one of the guns up there.

00:14:38,366 --> 00:14:41,836
Actually,
they're Bobby Dawson's guns.

00:14:41,903 --> 00:14:43,505
He made me sign
for them-- I'm sure

00:14:43,571 --> 00:14:45,874
he wouldn't appreciate
if we brought them back damaged.

00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:48,843
Technically, they're <i>myguns--</i>
so toss one up there.

00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:54,649
Just for the record, I've never
really been good at sports.

00:14:54,716 --> 00:14:55,550
Sara?

00:14:55,617 --> 00:14:57,018
Yeah.

00:15:09,264 --> 00:15:11,966
How does that prove
the guy tossed the gun up there?

00:15:12,033 --> 00:15:13,535
You recovered it
from the ground.

00:15:13,601 --> 00:15:15,537
There's a cracked tile
up on the roof.

00:15:15,603 --> 00:15:17,372
I found a series of scratches

00:15:17,439 --> 00:15:20,041
stretching from the
cracked tile to the
end of the roof.

00:15:20,108 --> 00:15:21,910
I found scratches
and red clay dust

00:15:21,976 --> 00:15:23,411
in the suspect's .45.

00:15:23,478 --> 00:15:25,580
GRISSOM:
It explains how
the witnesses

00:15:25,647 --> 00:15:29,084
could see Estevez with his hands
up, and Sergeant Carroll

00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:31,252
then saw him with a gun
in his hand.

00:15:32,287 --> 00:15:34,422
The gun's still up there.

00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:38,660
Sara...

00:15:38,727 --> 00:15:40,729
try it again.

00:15:46,101 --> 00:15:47,068
Stop! Police!

00:15:47,135 --> 00:15:48,436
Get down!

00:15:48,503 --> 00:15:49,771
Don't move.

00:16:06,388 --> 00:16:08,656
There you have it.

00:16:08,723 --> 00:16:11,760
WILLOWS:
There's the Geo Metro.

00:16:11,826 --> 00:16:14,496
There's the Buick Regal.

00:16:14,562 --> 00:16:17,532
Oh, she's pregnant,
all right.

00:16:17,599 --> 00:16:20,435
Doesn't look like she
wants to go with him.

00:16:20,502 --> 00:16:24,072
He's not giving her
much choice.

00:16:24,139 --> 00:16:28,743
So, just how bad was the meeting
with the undersheriff?

00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:31,079
Worse than the dentist.

00:16:31,146 --> 00:16:33,248
Better than the proctologist.

00:16:33,314 --> 00:16:34,983
Mm.

00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:37,619
ECKLIE:
What's he doing?

00:16:37,685 --> 00:16:39,821
Looks like he's pulling out
a hide-a-key.

00:16:43,158 --> 00:16:45,427
ECKLIE:
Means the car
was waiting for them.

00:16:45,493 --> 00:16:47,429
Whatever they were about to do,

00:16:47,495 --> 00:16:50,465
they weren't going to do it
in the Metro.

00:16:58,339 --> 00:17:00,008
WILLOWS:
Hey, Nick?
Hey.

00:17:00,075 --> 00:17:02,444
Have you checked the
inside of the wheel wells?

00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:04,913
No. I was having
too much fun in here.

00:17:04,979 --> 00:17:06,181
Oh, yeah, I can see that.

00:17:06,247 --> 00:17:09,551
Um, well...
since you're already dirty,

00:17:09,617 --> 00:17:12,887
would you mind checking out
the left rear one for me?

00:17:12,954 --> 00:17:14,923
Yeah, sure.
Thank you.

00:17:16,758 --> 00:17:18,460
What are you looking for?

00:17:18,526 --> 00:17:22,297
I am looking for something
to hide a key in.

00:17:22,364 --> 00:17:26,501
Okay. Although, most hide-a-keys
are held on with a magnet,

00:17:26,568 --> 00:17:28,103
which would've been demagnetized

00:17:28,169 --> 00:17:30,638
by the heat
of the gasoline fire.

00:17:30,705 --> 00:17:32,741
Right.

00:17:32,807 --> 00:17:35,477
Nope.
Well,

00:17:35,543 --> 00:17:37,312
it probably fell off
at the location.

00:17:37,379 --> 00:17:41,783
Maybe. Auto transport
usually sweeps up the debris.

00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:44,219
Good luck with that.

00:18:51,019 --> 00:18:53,822
( <i>heart beating steadily</i> )

00:19:03,064 --> 00:19:05,467
( <i>gunshots</i> )

00:19:07,302 --> 00:19:09,437
( <i>heartbeat continues</i> )

00:19:16,644 --> 00:19:20,048
MAN:
<i>My son was riding his bike</i>
<i>to school.</i>

00:19:20,115 --> 00:19:22,784
<i>Today he's in a coma.</i>

00:19:22,851 --> 00:19:25,587
<i>But when he wakes up,</i>

00:19:25,653 --> 00:19:31,526
when he... opens his eyes again
and smiles at his mother,

00:19:31,593 --> 00:19:35,797
he will see all the... flowers

00:19:35,864 --> 00:19:38,733
and cards that he's been sent
from total strangers

00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,302
wishing him well and...

00:19:41,369 --> 00:19:44,139
praying for his recovery.

00:19:44,205 --> 00:19:48,143
Sheriff Burdick h-hasn't called.

00:19:48,209 --> 00:19:51,713
I've left so many messages
I've lost count.

00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,482
It's inconvenient, I know,

00:19:54,549 --> 00:19:57,285
but I have questions.

00:19:57,352 --> 00:19:59,688
Who did this to my son?

00:19:59,754 --> 00:20:02,957
Why did they do it?

00:20:03,024 --> 00:20:05,527
No one wants to answer me?

00:20:05,593 --> 00:20:08,663
If the cops didn't shoot him,
why won't they talk to me?

00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:11,232
If I have to go to court
to find out,

00:20:11,299 --> 00:20:14,135
if I have to sue
each and every officer involved,

00:20:14,202 --> 00:20:15,470
I'll do it.

00:20:15,537 --> 00:20:18,640
I will put the sheriff
in front of a jury

00:20:18,707 --> 00:20:20,275
and get my answers there.

00:20:20,341 --> 00:20:22,043
( <i>phone rings</i> )

00:20:25,013 --> 00:20:26,614
McKeen.

00:20:26,681 --> 00:20:29,617
Yes, sir. I saw the news.

00:20:29,684 --> 00:20:32,821
I still think we should wait
to issue a statement,

00:20:32,887 --> 00:20:35,256
at least until the lab
has something concrete.

00:20:35,323 --> 00:20:38,693
Hodges, it's not so
much that these guns
are my babies, okay?

00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,729
It's just that in order
to replace them,

00:20:40,795 --> 00:20:43,565
I got to go to Property,
got to locate another gun,

00:20:43,631 --> 00:20:46,401
fill out all that paperwork,
so all I'm saying is,
I would appreciate

00:20:46,468 --> 00:20:48,236
not being left out
of the loop, okay?

00:20:48,303 --> 00:20:49,771
I'm only a soldier in this war.

00:20:49,838 --> 00:20:51,773
The general gave me an order,
and I followed it.

00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,109
DAWSON:
Whatever.

00:20:54,175 --> 00:20:55,844
I've finished checking
this batch for trace.

00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:57,579
Bobby, police said they entered

00:20:57,645 --> 00:20:59,614
my cartridge case
from the sniper into IBIS.

00:20:59,681 --> 00:21:01,883
It has become my priority,
or so I was informed

00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:03,952
by Under Sheriff McKeen--
give me about an hour?

00:21:04,018 --> 00:21:05,653
Okay.

00:21:17,332 --> 00:21:18,933
I got blood.

00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,436
Where's it from?

00:21:21,503 --> 00:21:23,171
Expended bullet, Torres house,

00:21:23,238 --> 00:21:25,774
candle in the living room.
That's our
through-and-through.

00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,043
DAWSON:
Looks like a copper-jacketed

00:21:28,109 --> 00:21:29,411
nine-millimeter,

00:21:29,477 --> 00:21:31,646
<i>consistent with cop ammo.</i>

00:21:31,713 --> 00:21:33,615
( <i>grunting</i> )

00:21:39,187 --> 00:21:40,588
Brass, Sofia,

00:21:40,655 --> 00:21:43,992
Adams, Davis and Carroll
were all shooting nines.

00:21:44,059 --> 00:21:45,827
Compare it with their
firearms ASAP.

00:21:45,894 --> 00:21:47,562
I'm gonna go
tell Grissom.

00:21:54,803 --> 00:21:56,604
Looking for something?

00:21:57,772 --> 00:22:00,742
At least this car still has
a nice hubcap.

00:22:00,809 --> 00:22:02,077
Where'd you find that?

00:22:02,143 --> 00:22:05,413
On the pursuit route, Jefferson,
about ten blocks north of Third.

00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:09,417
Well, I've been through
this car twice.

00:22:09,484 --> 00:22:11,419
There's no evidence
of cartridge casings, blood,

00:22:11,486 --> 00:22:12,987
drugs of any kind.

00:22:13,054 --> 00:22:15,090
So there was nothing
here to begin with,

00:22:15,156 --> 00:22:17,425
They cleaned it out pretty good
before they torched it.

00:22:17,492 --> 00:22:19,127
Hey, Nick, Grissom.

00:22:19,194 --> 00:22:21,262
We found the through-
and-through bullet.

00:22:21,329 --> 00:22:22,397
Bobby's doing a comparison.

00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:24,466
I sent a sample of blood to DNA.

00:22:31,706 --> 00:22:33,375
BRASS:
Hey.

00:22:37,212 --> 00:22:38,146
I'm glad you called.

00:22:38,213 --> 00:22:39,247
I've been thinking
about you.

00:22:39,314 --> 00:22:41,416
Good. Yeah,
I wasn't sure.

00:22:43,351 --> 00:22:44,419
How you doing?

00:22:46,721 --> 00:22:48,256
I've gone a little crazy.

00:22:48,323 --> 00:22:50,225
Yeah. It's the waiting.

00:22:52,861 --> 00:22:55,730
You know, I've been
suspended or disciplined

00:22:55,797 --> 00:22:57,165
like six or seven times,

00:22:57,232 --> 00:23:00,101
and it's always the same,
the waiting.

00:23:00,168 --> 00:23:02,570
What you never forget is that

00:23:02,637 --> 00:23:05,173
you know, a police officer
lost his life.

00:23:09,511 --> 00:23:10,645
( <i>gunshot</i> )

00:23:10,712 --> 00:23:12,380
I have seen it so many times,

00:23:12,447 --> 00:23:14,082
I don't know
if it's real or not.

00:23:15,784 --> 00:23:17,585
Jim, it's like
he's looking at me--

00:23:17,652 --> 00:23:21,389
like as if he... as if he knew.

00:23:21,456 --> 00:23:24,659
Sofia, you got to get it
out of your head; that's poison.

00:23:24,726 --> 00:23:27,195
You telling me
you're not thinking about it?

00:23:27,262 --> 00:23:29,397
Oh, I'm thinking; I'm thinking
about a lot of stuff.

00:23:46,815 --> 00:23:47,782
Let me tell you something.

00:23:47,849 --> 00:23:49,417
You know, when I was a young cop

00:23:49,484 --> 00:23:50,985
in Jersey,
there was this kid--

00:23:51,052 --> 00:23:53,221
responded to an
all shots fired.

00:23:53,288 --> 00:23:55,523
Never got a radio call,
never knew what hit him.

00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:57,392
I was the first officer
on the scene--

00:23:57,459 --> 00:23:59,928
a patrolman, too.

00:23:59,994 --> 00:24:02,364
You know, it tore up the
department pretty good.

00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:05,633
Everybody was all twisted and...

00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:09,637
but we managed somehow to...

00:24:09,704 --> 00:24:11,940
I don't know,
get through it, some way.

00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:16,945
Who shot him?

00:24:18,513 --> 00:24:20,315
It really doesn't matter.

00:24:24,586 --> 00:24:26,821
It <i>does</i> matter.

00:24:28,256 --> 00:24:30,492
I could see Bell's face
when I was shooting him,

00:24:30,558 --> 00:24:34,129
which means I was...
I was shooting near him.

00:24:34,195 --> 00:24:35,130
I made a mistake.

00:24:35,196 --> 00:24:36,431
I shouldn't have fired.

00:24:36,498 --> 00:24:38,099
No, come on. It was chaos.

00:24:38,166 --> 00:24:39,701
You were just responding
to a situation.

00:24:39,768 --> 00:24:41,603
It was instinct,
it was training.

00:24:41,669 --> 00:24:43,104
No.

00:24:43,171 --> 00:24:44,739
Don't, don't
think that way.

00:24:59,821 --> 00:25:03,024
I'm always going to be
the cop who shot a cop.

00:25:07,362 --> 00:25:09,230
There's the green
Geo Metro.

00:25:09,297 --> 00:25:11,332
Okay, you
come with me.

00:25:11,399 --> 00:25:12,400
You two cover the back.

00:25:12,467 --> 00:25:13,768
Stay with her.

00:25:19,007 --> 00:25:20,442
( <i>knocking</i> )

00:25:20,508 --> 00:25:21,843
Police! We have
a search warrant! Open up!

00:25:24,412 --> 00:25:25,246
Hey!

00:25:26,448 --> 00:25:28,283
Suspect on the run!

00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:45,133
He's gonna meet you here.
Come on. Let's go.

00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,134
We have her, Detective.

00:25:46,201 --> 00:25:47,369
Wow. You had the baby

00:25:47,435 --> 00:25:49,204
and got your figure back
in one day.

00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:50,205
That's impossible.

00:25:50,271 --> 00:25:51,206
Believe me, I know.

00:25:51,272 --> 00:25:52,307
My wife's had
five kids.

00:25:56,811 --> 00:25:58,546
Oh, Tina, baby-- no.

00:25:58,613 --> 00:26:01,216
Peanut butter
without the jelly?

00:26:01,282 --> 00:26:04,386
She's trying to get me
to cut down on sugar.

00:26:04,452 --> 00:26:05,487
but this is ridiculous.

00:26:05,553 --> 00:26:07,155
Here.

00:26:07,222 --> 00:26:09,891
Thanks.

00:26:11,493 --> 00:26:12,494
Do you ever want to be a cop?

00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,729
Every time I get
a speeding ticket, yeah.

00:26:14,796 --> 00:26:17,165
No, I mean like guns
and car chases

00:26:17,232 --> 00:26:19,734
and "Put your back against
the wall," that kind of stuff.

00:26:19,801 --> 00:26:23,238
No, I prefer the scientific side
of law enforcement.

00:26:23,304 --> 00:26:24,205
Me, too.

00:26:24,272 --> 00:26:26,174
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

00:26:30,512 --> 00:26:31,679
Brown.

00:26:31,746 --> 00:26:33,081
Hey, Catherine.

00:26:33,148 --> 00:26:34,749
We got the couple
driving the Buick.

00:26:34,816 --> 00:26:36,217
Female wasn't pregnant.

00:26:36,284 --> 00:26:37,619
She was a mule.

00:26:37,685 --> 00:26:38,653
Really.

00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,223
Found her rig for transporting
narco inside the house,

00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:45,727
and unless these guys were
in the mail order business,

00:26:45,794 --> 00:26:47,729
I think they were
being shipped drugs.

00:26:47,796 --> 00:26:49,230
BROWN:
And delivering them

00:26:49,297 --> 00:26:50,899
to the guys up the food chain.

00:26:50,965 --> 00:26:51,900
Yeah.

00:26:51,966 --> 00:26:54,235
You think these are the same
guys who whacked Fausto?

00:26:54,302 --> 00:26:56,237
It's the best lead we've got.

00:26:58,001 --> 00:26:59,770
You were a passenger
in a stolen vehicle

00:26:59,836 --> 00:27:01,338
that failed to yield
to the police.

00:27:01,405 --> 00:27:03,006
We've also connected
you to a drug ring

00:27:03,073 --> 00:27:04,474
which was responsible

00:27:04,541 --> 00:27:08,745
for the death of
a police officer.

00:27:10,333 --> 00:27:11,802
Miss Guerro?

00:27:14,037 --> 00:27:17,908
You're looking at prison time,
so think about it.

00:27:17,974 --> 00:27:19,609
Whatever you could tell
us about these guys

00:27:19,676 --> 00:27:21,545
will be in your best interest.

00:27:25,215 --> 00:27:28,285
Surveillance footage
from Angie's Donut Shop

00:27:28,351 --> 00:27:30,754
shows you
carrying drugs

00:27:30,821 --> 00:27:32,956
and getting into
the delivery car.

00:27:33,023 --> 00:27:35,058
That alone gets you ten years.

00:27:36,393 --> 00:27:38,995
Okay, this is
your last chance

00:27:39,062 --> 00:27:40,731
for your client to
help herself out.

00:27:49,473 --> 00:27:51,108
You don't understand.
We had no choice.

00:27:51,174 --> 00:27:52,509
They would have killed us.

00:27:52,576 --> 00:27:53,844
Who would've killed you?

00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:55,912
There is nothing that
you can do to me

00:27:55,979 --> 00:27:57,748
that is worse
than what they can do.

00:28:01,084 --> 00:28:02,018
I'm done.

00:28:02,085 --> 00:28:03,420
I'm not talking no more.

00:28:03,487 --> 00:28:05,956
Mr. Contranos has served time
for narcotics possession.

00:28:06,022 --> 00:28:07,758
He's been deported
three times

00:28:07,824 --> 00:28:09,025
for entering
the country illegally.

00:28:09,092 --> 00:28:11,194
This time, we're going
to throw away the key.

00:28:11,261 --> 00:28:13,897
MAN:
Mr. Contranos has no interest
in speaking to you.

00:28:13,964 --> 00:28:15,632
We're talking about
the difference between

00:28:15,699 --> 00:28:17,401
life without parole
and the needle, here.

00:28:17,467 --> 00:28:20,103
He's prepared to do his time.

00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:27,978
Grissom, I managed
to get a hit

00:28:28,045 --> 00:28:30,113
off of that sniper
cartridge case.

00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:33,717
Links up to a drug rip-off
in L.A. last year-- unsolved.

00:28:33,784 --> 00:28:35,152
What about the phone records
from the motel?

00:28:35,218 --> 00:28:37,921
Fausto made one call about
an hour before he died.

00:28:37,988 --> 00:28:40,791
We ran it down to a
disposable mobile phone.

00:28:40,857 --> 00:28:43,226
So is there anything I can tell
the undersheriff?

00:28:43,293 --> 00:28:46,129
Yeah. Dead end on Fausto.

00:28:46,196 --> 00:28:47,464
You tell him.

00:29:01,144 --> 00:29:03,280
I got your results
from the blood on the bullet.

00:29:03,346 --> 00:29:05,649
It definitely belongs
to Officer Bell.

00:29:08,652 --> 00:29:11,421
This is my first
deceased police officer.

00:29:11,488 --> 00:29:13,056
I heard that his
wife is pregnant.

00:29:13,123 --> 00:29:16,560
Wendy, you understand
that this is confidential.

00:29:16,626 --> 00:29:19,896
Yes, sir.
And you can't discuss it,
even with your coworkers.

00:29:19,963 --> 00:29:22,132
I understand what this means.

00:29:31,041 --> 00:29:34,378
Hey. Warrick tell you
about the IBIS hit?

00:29:34,444 --> 00:29:35,412
Yeah.

00:29:35,479 --> 00:29:38,115
How are you doing
with Bell's bullet?

00:29:38,181 --> 00:29:39,449
I was confirming my findings.

00:29:39,516 --> 00:29:42,085
Don't want to make any mistakes.

00:29:42,152 --> 00:29:43,987
Does that mean
you have results?

00:29:44,054 --> 00:29:47,057
The bullet has the right GRC's
for a Sig-Sauer.

00:29:47,124 --> 00:29:49,126
Sergeant Adams
carries a Beretta.

00:29:49,192 --> 00:29:50,327
Carroll, too.

00:29:50,394 --> 00:29:52,729
Davis has a Glock, so
that rules him out.

00:29:52,796 --> 00:29:56,800
However, both detectives
Brass and Curtis carry Sigs.

00:29:58,735 --> 00:30:00,837
But take a look.

00:30:04,174 --> 00:30:06,143
There's hardly any jacket left.
Means there's almost

00:30:06,209 --> 00:30:09,179
no chance of identifying that
to a specific gun.

00:30:09,246 --> 00:30:11,014
What if you had more time?
Could you do it?

00:30:11,081 --> 00:30:13,517
Sorry, boss.
I mean, there's just no way

00:30:13,583 --> 00:30:16,219
I can tell you
who shot Officer Bell.

00:30:17,754 --> 00:30:18,989
You know, based
on the dates

00:30:19,056 --> 00:30:21,291
of these address labels,
it appears that Carlos

00:30:21,358 --> 00:30:22,759
and Bianca
were receiving

00:30:22,826 --> 00:30:24,828
two to three
drug shipments a day.

00:30:24,895 --> 00:30:27,330
So the dogs hit on the boxes?

00:30:27,397 --> 00:30:29,933
Yes, and Narco found
trace amounts of cocaine,

00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,437
for whatever that's worth.

00:30:33,503 --> 00:30:36,173
Well, the return
addresses are
all bogus,

00:30:36,239 --> 00:30:37,374
the couple is not talking,

00:30:37,441 --> 00:30:38,475
and all four suspects

00:30:38,542 --> 00:30:40,477
are dead.

00:30:40,544 --> 00:30:42,345
There's nothing more we can do.

00:30:53,023 --> 00:30:55,192
Okay, Nick, the cruiser's
right front tire

00:30:55,258 --> 00:30:56,893
is 19 feet, 5 inches

00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,195
from the south curb.

00:31:01,064 --> 00:31:03,500
Sara, the detective unit's
left front tire

00:31:03,567 --> 00:31:05,535
is five feet to inches
from the south curb.

00:31:10,073 --> 00:31:11,208
All right.

00:31:11,274 --> 00:31:13,143
Nick, you be Brass.

00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:14,878
Sara, you be Sofia.

00:31:14,945 --> 00:31:16,747
Good.

00:31:16,813 --> 00:31:18,348
I'll be Bell.

00:31:18,415 --> 00:31:22,219
Officer Bell was crouched down
behind his door.

00:31:31,661 --> 00:31:34,865
Gris! I can't see you from here.

00:31:34,931 --> 00:31:37,401
You're blocked by both cars.

00:31:37,467 --> 00:31:38,602
Yeah, me either.

00:31:38,668 --> 00:31:40,437
I'd have to shoot
through both cars to get to you.

00:31:40,504 --> 00:31:43,273
I processed them both--
no shots

00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,574
entered from the back.

00:31:46,676 --> 00:31:48,345
Can you see me here?

00:31:50,847 --> 00:31:53,016
Yeah, I can see you.
Yeah, now.

00:31:55,018 --> 00:31:57,954
What would make Bell stand up
in the middle of a gunfight?

00:31:58,021 --> 00:32:00,791
Maybe he had
to change positions.

00:32:00,857 --> 00:32:02,626
We know that the suspects
were starting

00:32:02,692 --> 00:32:03,960
to run, right?

00:32:04,027 --> 00:32:06,596
Okay, he popped up,
took one in the vest.

00:32:08,265 --> 00:32:10,467
Let's assume that.

00:32:10,534 --> 00:32:12,335
We'll line up the exit
trajectories

00:32:12,402 --> 00:32:14,071
with the apartment window,

00:32:14,137 --> 00:32:16,306
and we'll use lasers,
but we may have to wait

00:32:16,373 --> 00:32:17,874
until it's dark.

00:32:21,712 --> 00:32:23,647
WILLOWS:
We're turning on the lasers.

00:32:23,714 --> 00:32:25,148
Is the candle in position?

00:32:25,215 --> 00:32:28,118
Ready on this end.

00:32:28,185 --> 00:32:30,487
Let me know when the beam
hits the candle.

00:32:30,554 --> 00:32:31,555
Good to go!

00:32:38,729 --> 00:32:40,831
Uh... good height.

00:32:40,897 --> 00:32:42,833
Move it six inches to the left.

00:32:42,899 --> 00:32:44,735
Six inches to the left.

00:32:47,237 --> 00:32:49,673
Oh, no, no. <i>My</i> left.

00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,074
He meant the other left.

00:33:00,584 --> 00:33:01,685
Right there.

00:33:01,752 --> 00:33:02,786
Perfect.

00:33:02,853 --> 00:33:04,020
I'll call you back.

00:33:04,087 --> 00:33:06,022
Okay, we got the exit.

00:33:06,089 --> 00:33:08,024
Now we need the entrance.

00:33:08,091 --> 00:33:09,426
Sara, turn your laser on.

00:33:14,765 --> 00:33:16,533
The path of my laser is off.

00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,868
Yeah, it's a bad angle.

00:33:17,934 --> 00:33:19,603
Move it to the left.

00:33:21,538 --> 00:33:23,607
Gris...
Hmm?

00:33:23,673 --> 00:33:25,342
It's blocked
by the car.

00:33:25,409 --> 00:33:27,044
It's not possible.

00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:29,479
Turn it off.

00:33:29,546 --> 00:33:31,048
Nick, turn yours on.

00:33:31,114 --> 00:33:33,850
Mine's been on the whole time.

00:33:33,917 --> 00:33:35,786
It's still blocked.

00:33:40,223 --> 00:33:41,625
Raise it up.

00:34:03,513 --> 00:34:05,415
He stood up.

00:34:34,578 --> 00:34:36,583
Well, your call was
a little cryptic.

00:34:36,667 --> 00:34:40,103
Must've got the results
from the ballistics test.

00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:43,073
We did, but it
was inconclusive,

00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:46,210
so I went back to the
intersection and ran
a reconstruction.

00:34:46,276 --> 00:34:48,745
Well, I don't know how you
reconstruct a war zone.

00:34:48,812 --> 00:34:50,614
You have no idea
what it was like.

00:34:50,681 --> 00:34:52,216
I mean, it was a fire fight.

00:34:54,451 --> 00:34:56,920
Have you talked to Sofia?

00:34:58,922 --> 00:35:01,258
It wasn't Sofia.

00:35:05,395 --> 00:35:07,397
You must have stood up...

00:35:07,464 --> 00:35:10,567
fired at the suspects
over the black and whites.

00:35:10,634 --> 00:35:12,703
Officer Bell stood
up at the same time,

00:35:12,769 --> 00:35:14,338
right into your
line of fire.

00:35:14,404 --> 00:35:17,674
Fausto shot him
in the vest, which
spun him a little.

00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:20,511
At the same time,
you hit him in the neck.

00:35:22,779 --> 00:35:27,584
( <i>sighs</i> )
Oh, I-I swear,
I was behind the car, I...

00:35:27,651 --> 00:35:29,920
I-I stood up?

00:35:34,691 --> 00:35:37,528
Sheriff wants me to
present our findings

00:35:37,594 --> 00:35:39,730
at a community
meeting in an hour.

00:35:39,797 --> 00:35:41,865
( sighs )

00:35:47,237 --> 00:35:49,273
Don't keep 'em waiting.

00:36:03,487 --> 00:36:05,155
ORTEGA:
I just received

00:36:05,222 --> 00:36:08,625
a report from the
Shooting Review Board.

00:36:10,694 --> 00:36:12,729
You've been cleared.

00:36:16,767 --> 00:36:19,570
You can go back to work.

00:36:22,906 --> 00:36:24,908
Thank you.

Hello. My name is
Dr. Gil Grissom.

00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:41,892
I'm the night shift supervisor

00:36:41,959 --> 00:36:45,028
for the Las Vegas Police
Department's Crime Lab.

00:36:45,095 --> 00:36:48,098
( <i>murmuring fades</i> )
I'm not a police officer;
I'm a scientist.

00:36:48,165 --> 00:36:50,234
You work for the cops.
That makes you a cop.

00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,502
You're not on our side.

00:36:51,568 --> 00:36:53,871
( <i>loud clamoring voices</i> )

00:36:58,242 --> 00:37:00,511
Actually,
I'm a forensics expert.

00:37:00,577 --> 00:37:03,180
( <i>murmuring fades</i> )
My job is
to identify,

00:37:03,247 --> 00:37:06,517
collect, and examine physical
evidence from a crime scene,

00:37:06,583 --> 00:37:10,420
to determine who did what to
whom and how did they do it.

00:37:10,487 --> 00:37:12,656
I've been asked to come here
today by the mayor

00:37:12,723 --> 00:37:17,127
and Sheriff Burdick to present
our analysis of the evidence

00:37:17,194 --> 00:37:18,929
in this case to your community.

00:37:18,996 --> 00:37:21,498
Why aren't they here?
Why should we believe
your evidence?

00:37:21,565 --> 00:37:24,401
( <i>loud murmuring</i> )

00:37:24,468 --> 00:37:27,104
Physical evidence
cannot be wrong.

00:37:27,171 --> 00:37:28,972
It doesn't lie.

00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:32,709
It's not influenced by emotion
or prejudice.
( <i>murmuring fades</i> )

00:37:32,776 --> 00:37:36,313
It's... it's not confused by
the excitement of the moment.

00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:40,350
I'm here, in God's house,

00:37:40,417 --> 00:37:43,053
to explain to you the truth

00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,956
about exactly what happened
the other day.

00:37:46,023 --> 00:37:50,828
I'd like to start by showing you
some photos.

00:37:50,894 --> 00:37:52,729
This is a bullet
that was recovered

00:37:52,796 --> 00:37:56,533
from the Kevlar vest
of Officer Daniel Bell,

00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,734
now deceased.

00:37:57,801 --> 00:37:59,169
What about my son?

00:37:59,236 --> 00:38:03,073
What-What does the evidence say
about my son?

00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:07,878
Okay, if you like,
we can start there.

00:38:07,945 --> 00:38:09,413
Please.

00:38:11,648 --> 00:38:14,585
This photo is a comparison of
two cartridge cases.

00:38:14,651 --> 00:38:17,654
The one on the right was found
next to your son.

00:38:17,721 --> 00:38:19,556
The one on the left

00:38:19,623 --> 00:38:23,894
was test-fired
from Jose Fausto's pistol.

00:38:23,961 --> 00:38:28,565
As you can see, there are
corresponding individual marks

00:38:28,632 --> 00:38:30,801
on both cartridges.

00:38:30,868 --> 00:38:33,570
These are unique,
like fingerprints.

00:38:33,637 --> 00:38:37,074
It means that they were
fired from the same gun.

00:38:37,141 --> 00:38:41,612
It proves that while attempting
to escape from the police...

00:38:41,678 --> 00:38:45,082
Jose Fausto shot your son
Geraldo in the back.

00:38:45,149 --> 00:38:46,950
Why would he do that?

00:38:48,385 --> 00:38:52,589
We recovered your son's bicycle
from Jose Fausto's motel room.

00:38:52,656 --> 00:38:55,292
Your son was on his way
to football practice.

00:38:57,427 --> 00:38:58,695
( <i>gunshot</i> )
( <i>groans</i> )

00:38:58,762 --> 00:39:02,866
It appears that Jose Fausto
shot your son

00:39:02,933 --> 00:39:05,569
so he could use his bike.

00:39:34,364 --> 00:39:37,401
( <i>indistinct voices</i> )

00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:57,187
Jim, I was just on
my way out, but if you
want me to stay...

00:39:57,254 --> 00:39:59,857
No, I-I think I
can handle it.
I think.

00:39:59,923 --> 00:40:01,658
Thanks.
Okay.

The Shooting Review Board wants
to talk to you.

00:40:52,709 --> 00:40:55,913
You're going to have to explain
your tactical decision

00:40:55,979 --> 00:40:59,917
for shooting in the direction
of a fellow officer.

00:40:59,983 --> 00:41:03,053
I'm ready
when they are.

00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:06,824
As far as I'm concerned,
there's no question...

00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:09,860
it was a bad shoot.

00:41:13,664 --> 00:41:15,766
I'll have to
live with that.
