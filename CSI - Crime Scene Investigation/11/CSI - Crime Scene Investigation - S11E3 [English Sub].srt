00:00:03,086 --> 00:00:05,083
(moans)

00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,080
(sighs)

00:00:15,623 --> 00:00:16,758
(gasps)

00:00:20,695 --> 00:00:21,763
(panting)

00:00:24,465 --> 00:00:25,567
(groans)

00:00:28,536 --> 00:00:29,837
(fabric tears)

00:00:32,006 --> 00:00:33,041
(gasps)

00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:35,643
(heavy breathing)

00:00:35,643 --> 00:00:36,644
No! Stop, please!

00:00:36,644 --> 00:00:38,680
Don't stop.

00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,881
(metal blade scrapes)

00:00:39,881 --> 00:00:40,882
(screams)

00:00:44,953 --> 00:00:47,085
(indistinct police radio
transmission)

00:00:47,085 --> 00:00:48,923
Hey.

00:00:50,858 --> 00:00:53,595
You know that the speed limit
is not a suggestion, right?

00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:55,563
You gonna give me
a ticket, copper?

00:00:55,563 --> 00:00:57,398
Used to bring
Lindsey up here.

00:00:57,398 --> 00:01:00,668
Mount Charleston always
has been a hot spot

00:01:00,668 --> 00:01:02,904
for skiers and hikers and...

00:01:02,904 --> 00:01:05,083
Now murderers.

00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,725
You can see the terror
in his eyes.

00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:27,028
This man knew
he was going to die.

00:01:31,081 --> 00:01:33,534
This is a serious blood pool.

00:01:33,534 --> 00:01:36,604
He was alive
when his head was chopped off.

00:01:40,742 --> 00:01:43,845
Still tacky.

00:01:43,845 --> 00:01:45,083
Fresh kill.

00:01:45,083 --> 00:01:47,382
VARTANN:
So the park ranger said

00:01:47,382 --> 00:01:49,085
he thought he heard
wolves howling,

00:01:49,085 --> 00:01:51,386
but they're not native to
the area, so he came

00:01:51,386 --> 00:01:52,754
down here to check it out.

00:01:52,754 --> 00:01:56,084
WILLOWS:
Looks like his body's
been posed.

00:01:56,084 --> 00:01:58,593
Could be some kind
of a cult killing.

00:01:58,593 --> 00:02:00,395
Satanic rituals
are often performed

00:02:00,395 --> 00:02:03,031
in a natural setting
like this, but this...

00:02:03,031 --> 00:02:05,033
fence is a poor altar.

00:02:05,033 --> 00:02:07,835
If this was a ritualistic
killing, there would be some...

00:02:07,835 --> 00:02:09,671
sign.

00:02:11,472 --> 00:02:12,640
Blood moon.

00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:14,909
In the Book of Revelations,

00:02:14,909 --> 00:02:19,079
it was considered to be a
precursor to the end of days.

00:02:20,086 --> 00:02:23,087
Well, it certainly was
for this poor guy.

STOKES:
No tire tracks, no footprints.

00:03:02,657 --> 00:03:04,659
I can't even
see my own.

00:03:06,661 --> 00:03:09,082
He's not dressed
for hiking.
Mm-mm.

00:03:09,082 --> 00:03:10,531
He had to get out here
some way.

00:03:10,531 --> 00:03:12,633
Well, there's no ID on him.

00:03:16,085 --> 00:03:18,088
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:03:18,088 --> 00:03:21,082
Where is the bug man
when you need him?

00:03:21,082 --> 00:03:23,082
I'm right here, buddy.

00:03:25,913 --> 00:03:28,449
What is that?

00:03:28,449 --> 00:03:30,017
That is a long-horned beetle.

00:03:33,988 --> 00:03:35,523
Nick, there's something
else in his mouth,

00:03:35,523 --> 00:03:38,693
and it's not moving.

00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,566
(camera shutter clicks)

00:03:45,566 --> 00:03:47,080
LANGSTON:
Hair.

00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,503
Maybe he got a piece
of his attacker.

00:03:48,503 --> 00:03:50,079
(Velcro tears)
Mm-hmm.

00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:51,706
Guys, I'm gonna need
some bigger tools.

00:03:51,706 --> 00:03:52,707
Yeah, okay.

00:03:56,844 --> 00:04:00,081
I've got some
ligature marks on his wrist.

00:04:00,081 --> 00:04:02,083
You check the other one,
will you?

00:04:04,652 --> 00:04:06,954
Yeah, same thing over here.

00:04:06,954 --> 00:04:09,457
But these patterns
are inconsistent

00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:10,825
with this barbed wire.

00:04:10,825 --> 00:04:13,394
(groans)
Stop, please stop!

00:04:13,394 --> 00:04:15,596
STOKES: Looks like somebody
brought chains to the party.

00:04:15,596 --> 00:04:19,667
Do you see these abrasions
and cuts here in the chest?

00:04:19,667 --> 00:04:22,937
They appear to have been
made by the barbed wire.

00:04:22,937 --> 00:04:24,079
Hmm...
So, our victim

00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:27,082
ran into the barbed-
wire fence, and then...

00:04:27,082 --> 00:04:30,578
our killer... turned him around.

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,083
(groans)

00:04:34,086 --> 00:04:36,584
Killer wanted to
look him in the eye.

00:04:36,584 --> 00:04:38,553
It would have made the killer
feel very powerful.

00:04:38,553 --> 00:04:41,856
Hang on, now, Super Dave.

00:04:41,856 --> 00:04:43,591
You just gonna chop him up?

00:04:43,591 --> 00:04:45,085
Oh, Dr. Robbins said
that he wanted

00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:46,594
the head
with the pike,

00:04:46,594 --> 00:04:48,079
and the body with the fence.

00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,731
I'll take the saw.
Okay.

00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:55,470
I'll grab the head?
Yep.

00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,083
Ready?
Mm-hmm.

00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:58,639
(saw buzzes)

00:05:00,085 --> 00:05:02,079
ROBBINS (grunting):
<i>Okay.</i>

00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,087
It's like trying to get
meat off a shish kebab.

00:05:04,087 --> 00:05:06,948
(grunting)

00:05:06,948 --> 00:05:08,086
You all right?

00:05:08,086 --> 00:05:09,087
Yeah. Yeah.

00:05:11,652 --> 00:05:14,079
Give me a hand, David.
Mm-hmm.

00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:22,083
The post went through the
trachea, soft palate,

00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:24,599
and all the way
into the brain.

00:05:25,733 --> 00:05:29,083
Thank you.
Yeah.

00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:30,004
Heads or tails?

00:05:30,004 --> 00:05:31,080
I'll take heads.

00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,743
♪ ♪

00:05:47,081 --> 00:05:48,956
(saw buzzing)

00:06:03,085 --> 00:06:05,773
Lizzie Borden got an axe

00:06:05,773 --> 00:06:07,808
and gave her mother 40 whacks.

00:06:07,808 --> 00:06:11,083
Contrary to the poem, Lizzie
Borden gave her parents

00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:13,681
a total of 29 whacks.

00:06:13,681 --> 00:06:15,079
In this case,

00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:16,984
we won't know the number
of whacks

00:06:16,984 --> 00:06:19,081
or the type of weapon
that did the whacking

00:06:19,081 --> 00:06:22,087
until we boil off the flesh
and examine the tool marks.

00:06:24,859 --> 00:06:26,861
(camera shutter clicks)

00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:37,088
He has got symmetrical
scars on both palms.

00:06:37,088 --> 00:06:38,539
That would support the theory

00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:40,080
that we're dealing with
some kind of cult.

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,809
Bloodletting
is a common practice.

00:06:41,809 --> 00:06:42,977
Abrasions are deep.

00:06:42,977 --> 00:06:44,645
He struggled.

00:06:44,645 --> 00:06:46,914
It's a powerful thing,
the will to live.

00:06:48,516 --> 00:06:50,618
Well, so is the will to kill.

00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:54,087
Looks like more than
a dozen chop marks.

00:06:57,425 --> 00:06:59,393
Whoa.

00:06:59,393 --> 00:07:01,028
The water's beading.

00:07:03,085 --> 00:07:06,081
Lotions and massage oils

00:07:06,081 --> 00:07:08,803
make water run off
the skin like this.
Yeah.

00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:11,672
This man has very little
body hair.

00:07:11,672 --> 00:07:13,708
He's been waxed.

00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:17,080
From head to toe.

00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,087
And... everywhere in-between.

00:07:20,548 --> 00:07:23,484
LANGSTON:
Doesn't seem to be
any hair regrowth.

00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:25,453
This was done recently.

00:07:31,926 --> 00:07:34,085
The thing about wax is...

00:07:34,085 --> 00:07:36,831
it likes to stick around.

00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,666
I'll get this
to Hodges.

00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,868
Hey. I ran our vic's
prints through AFIS.

00:07:40,868 --> 00:07:43,087
He's not in the system, and no
one matching his description

00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:44,088
has been reported missing.

00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:45,606
Well, if he's
a tourist,

00:07:45,606 --> 00:07:47,675
it could be that no one
knows he's gone yet.

00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:49,543
I got his photo out
to all the hotels,

00:07:49,543 --> 00:07:52,079
so maybe somebody
will recognize him.

00:07:53,381 --> 00:07:55,516
You know, uh, last night...
Mm-hmm?

00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:57,518
was...
Really great.

00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:59,520
We gotta do
that more often.

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,989
Yeah, why don't you
move in with me?

00:08:01,989 --> 00:08:03,491
What did you just say?

00:08:03,491 --> 00:08:06,394
(chuckles)

00:08:06,394 --> 00:08:08,088
Yeah, I'm, uh... I'm serious.

00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:10,398
I'd like to make dinner
for you every night.

00:08:10,398 --> 00:08:11,932
Maybe a little
breakfast in bed,

00:08:11,932 --> 00:08:13,082
if you're good.

00:08:13,082 --> 00:08:14,082
That sounds nice.

00:08:16,671 --> 00:08:18,739
I... I'll talk to you later.

00:08:18,739 --> 00:08:20,975
Yeah.

00:08:24,082 --> 00:08:26,084
I always imagined Wendy and me
moving in together.

00:08:26,084 --> 00:08:28,883
Cuddling on the couch.
Watching the<i>Iron Chef.</i>

00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,751
Battle Garbanzo Bean
was our favorite.

00:08:30,751 --> 00:08:32,420
Do you have something for me?

00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:35,523
Olive oil, rosemary,
and a little lemon juice.

00:08:35,523 --> 00:08:37,082
Salad dressing.
Yeah, you throw in

00:08:37,082 --> 00:08:40,995
a balsamic, and you have a
vinaigrette, but in this case...

00:08:40,995 --> 00:08:44,080
It's the ingredients in the wax
that was used on your victim

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,733
for his extensive man-scaping.

00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,034
Double ouch.

00:08:47,034 --> 00:08:50,671
I used to go to the Anubis Spa.

00:08:50,671 --> 00:08:52,085
They had this sugar-based wax

00:08:52,085 --> 00:08:54,087
which is similar to what
they used in ancient Egypt.

00:08:54,087 --> 00:08:56,744
So an olive oil-based wax...

00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:59,013
I'm guessing the
Mediterranean Hotel?

00:09:00,084 --> 00:09:02,087
STOKES:
<i>So the hotel spa confirmed that</i>

00:09:02,087 --> 00:09:05,386
Michael Wilson had a full-body
wax there three days ago.

00:09:05,386 --> 00:09:06,921
Should be the room
up here, huh?

00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,723
Yeah. Yeah,
it's right here.

00:09:08,723 --> 00:09:10,088
Front desk recognized
the photograph

00:09:10,088 --> 00:09:11,726
that Vartann's been
shopping around.

00:09:11,726 --> 00:09:13,461
Said that Wilson came
in from San Diego

00:09:13,461 --> 00:09:15,629
and he's here for some
kind of convention.
Hmm.

00:09:15,629 --> 00:09:17,631
(beeping, door latch clicks)

00:09:22,803 --> 00:09:24,805
STOKES:
Obvious signs of a struggle.

00:09:24,805 --> 00:09:27,087
LANGSTON: It would be
pretty hard to take

00:09:27,087 --> 00:09:29,410
someone out of a hotel room
against their will

00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:31,079
without getting caught
on camera, right?

00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:32,680
I'll pull surveillance.

00:09:38,552 --> 00:09:41,388
Looks like Mr. Wilson was here
for a special occasion.

00:09:41,388 --> 00:09:42,723
STOKES:
Yeah?
(camera clicks)

00:09:45,426 --> 00:09:47,828
"Today and for all eternity--

00:09:47,828 --> 00:09:50,087
I dedicate my soul to you."

00:09:50,087 --> 00:09:51,398
I love you, too, honey.

00:09:51,398 --> 00:09:53,084
They're wedding vows.

00:09:53,084 --> 00:09:54,935
He was getting married.

00:09:58,739 --> 00:10:00,674
STOKES:
Found a yellow contact lens.

00:10:00,674 --> 00:10:02,877
That's an
unusual color.

00:10:02,877 --> 00:10:05,446
Victim wasn't
wearing contacts.

00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:13,085
Huh.

00:10:13,085 --> 00:10:15,079
A Celtic love knot.

00:10:15,079 --> 00:10:18,082
It's where, uh, the
expression "tying the knot"

00:10:18,082 --> 00:10:19,727
came from, you know.
Uh-huh.

00:10:19,727 --> 00:10:22,088
I got a couple
of receipts here.

00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:23,964
One for flowers,
one for a cake,

00:10:23,964 --> 00:10:25,566
and according to this,

00:10:25,566 --> 00:10:29,081
they're supposed to be delivered
to the Unity Room of this hotel

00:10:29,081 --> 00:10:30,671
on the seventh.

00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:32,439
The wedding's today.

00:10:32,439 --> 00:10:35,042
(organ playing somber dirge)

00:10:44,088 --> 00:10:46,754
(hissing)

00:10:47,555 --> 00:10:49,084
(snarls)

00:10:49,084 --> 00:10:51,086
You wouldn't happen to have
any garlic on you, would you?

00:10:51,086 --> 00:10:52,493
No, I'm fresh out.

00:10:52,493 --> 00:10:54,083
Ah.

00:10:54,995 --> 00:10:56,088
(hisses)

00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:06,006
I think I'm going to be sick.

00:11:06,006 --> 00:11:07,641
Julie, we just have
a few more questions.

00:11:07,641 --> 00:11:09,043
MAN:
Hasn't she been
through enough?

00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,511
I'm going to put a stop to this.

00:11:10,511 --> 00:11:12,680
Your kind clearly have no
right to badger her like this.

00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,014
"Our kind"?

00:11:14,014 --> 00:11:15,083
Mr. Stewart,

00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,951
a young man
has been brutally murdered.

00:11:16,951 --> 00:11:18,719
We have every right to be here.

00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:20,554
And as far as I'm concerned,
you can drop the act.

00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:22,623
The act?
Miss Crenshaw,
when was the

00:11:22,623 --> 00:11:23,791
last time that you saw

00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:25,025
your fiancé?

00:11:25,025 --> 00:11:27,079
Uh, yesterday afternoon...

00:11:27,079 --> 00:11:28,696
when we rehearsed the ceremony.

00:11:28,696 --> 00:11:29,897
So roughly 24 hours ago.

00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,465
They didn't want to
see each other

00:11:31,465 --> 00:11:33,634
before the wedding.
It's tradition.

00:11:33,634 --> 00:11:37,079
We embrace the... the
principles and the morals

00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:39,039
of centuries past.

00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:41,542
Not like the present,
where you drive through a chapel

00:11:41,542 --> 00:11:43,086
and Elvis will hand you
a license.

00:11:43,086 --> 00:11:44,845
As to Michael's state of mind
last night--

00:11:44,845 --> 00:11:46,814
did he seem agitated,

00:11:46,814 --> 00:11:48,482
or... unsettled?

00:11:48,482 --> 00:11:49,984
MAN 2:
<i>No.</i>

00:11:49,984 --> 00:11:52,453
Michael was about to marry
the love of his life.

00:11:52,453 --> 00:11:54,081
I've never seen anyone so happy.

00:11:54,081 --> 00:11:57,391
Ethan. You're the
best man, right?

00:11:57,391 --> 00:11:58,659
Right.

00:11:58,659 --> 00:12:00,527
So you were in charge
of the bachelor party?

00:12:00,527 --> 00:12:03,080
Bachelor party?

00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:06,081
Yeah, did you guys party like a
rap star last night, or what?

00:12:06,081 --> 00:12:08,084
We simply dined.

00:12:08,084 --> 00:12:09,670
Then Michael went back
to his room

00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,080
to work on his vows
and meditate.

00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,706
Vampires meditate?

00:12:12,706 --> 00:12:15,676
A true vampiric state
can only be achieved

00:12:15,676 --> 00:12:17,085
through discipline
and self-control.

00:12:17,085 --> 00:12:19,081
LANGSTON:
<i>Self-control wasn't exercised</i>

00:12:19,081 --> 00:12:20,414
in Michael's hotel room.

00:12:20,414 --> 00:12:22,085
The place was
completely trashed.

00:12:22,085 --> 00:12:24,018
This is all my fault.

00:12:24,018 --> 00:12:27,388
I was the one who wanted to
get married at the convention.

00:12:27,388 --> 00:12:28,622
Where they let anyone in.

00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:32,080
All of our friends were
going to be here, anyway.

00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,762
I wanted them to see
how happy we were.

00:12:34,762 --> 00:12:36,086
Let's go back to

00:12:36,086 --> 00:12:38,432
where they let everyone in.
Who's "everyone"?

00:12:38,432 --> 00:12:40,834
This is a Covens
and Clans convention.

00:12:41,936 --> 00:12:46,084
Vampires, and...
unfortunately werewolves.

00:12:46,084 --> 00:12:48,709
Mr. Stewart...

00:12:48,709 --> 00:12:51,412
May I see your
hand, please?

00:12:52,913 --> 00:12:53,881
Huh.

00:12:53,881 --> 00:12:55,085
Miss Crenshaw?

00:12:59,853 --> 00:13:01,789
We found the same scar

00:13:01,789 --> 00:13:04,858
on Michael's palms.

00:13:04,858 --> 00:13:07,087
In the movies, vampires
thirst for blood. Well...

00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:09,080
we're not sanguinarians.

00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,931
For us, blood is a...

00:13:10,931 --> 00:13:13,087
a symbol of the life force
that flows through us.

00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:14,868
We shed our blood
in ceremonies

00:13:14,868 --> 00:13:18,605
to bind one
another together.

00:13:21,408 --> 00:13:24,081
Whoever killed Michael

00:13:24,081 --> 00:13:25,679
put a stake in my heart, too.

00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:32,080
This has Van Helsing
written all over it.

00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,083
The vampire slayer?
Mm-hmm.

00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:36,081
I thought he just staked
them through the heart.

00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:38,692
The staking was just to
keep them in their coffins.

00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:40,461
If you really want
to kill a vampire,

00:13:40,461 --> 00:13:41,996
you have to cut off his head.

00:13:41,996 --> 00:13:44,083
Only this guy wasn't
a real vampire.

00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:46,467
Well, someone thought so.

00:13:46,467 --> 00:13:49,084
You know, a few years ago,
in Romania,

00:13:49,084 --> 00:13:52,085
a family dug up their dead
relative because they thought

00:13:52,085 --> 00:13:53,407
he was a vampire.

00:13:53,407 --> 00:13:55,081
They ripped out his heart,

00:13:55,081 --> 00:13:56,643
burned it,

00:13:56,643 --> 00:13:57,845
mixed the ashes with water,

00:13:57,845 --> 00:13:59,013
and then drank it.

00:13:59,013 --> 00:14:01,084
Seriously?

00:14:01,084 --> 00:14:03,817
And, much like you,
the Romanian police

00:14:03,817 --> 00:14:05,719
didn't believe in vampires,

00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:07,080
so they charged the family

00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,923
with abusing a corpse.

00:14:09,923 --> 00:14:11,959
Served three
years in prison.

00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:14,895
But the townspeople
thought they were heroes.

00:14:16,085 --> 00:14:19,700
Individual stria match.

00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,669
A single tool
made all these cuts.

00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:27,081
Depth impressions range from
one-to-three-eighths of an inch,

00:14:27,081 --> 00:14:29,710
indicating varying degrees
of force.

00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:33,847
The killer used a curved,
heavy-headed blade,

00:14:33,847 --> 00:14:36,917
most likely an axe or a hatchet.

00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:38,585
(rock music plays)

00:14:38,585 --> 00:14:41,079
Yeah, okay. Thanks, Arch.

00:14:43,081 --> 00:14:44,085
(snarls)

00:14:44,085 --> 00:14:46,727
Well, so much
for our abduction theory.

00:14:46,727 --> 00:14:49,079
Surveillance confirmed that
Michael Wilson left the hotel

00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:50,731
at midnight by himself.

00:14:50,731 --> 00:14:52,800
LANGSTON:
There had to be
some kind of altercation.

00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,083
You did see his room.

00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:55,402
Yeah, whoever started it

00:14:55,402 --> 00:14:58,605
probably finished it
at Mount Charleston.

00:14:58,605 --> 00:15:00,474
Ah, whoa.
(laughs deeply)

00:15:00,474 --> 00:15:01,542
What do you think?

00:15:01,542 --> 00:15:03,081
Creepy.
Yeah.

00:15:03,081 --> 00:15:04,545
I do feel powerful.

00:15:04,545 --> 00:15:07,086
I feel... you know,
dangerous. Hmm?

00:15:07,086 --> 00:15:09,683
I think maybe the reason
these people dress up

00:15:09,683 --> 00:15:13,085
like these creatures is to help
them embrace their dark side.

00:15:13,085 --> 00:15:14,655
Yeah, yeah, no, I get it.

00:15:14,655 --> 00:15:16,423
You kinda scared me
for a minute there.
Okay, okay.

00:15:16,423 --> 00:15:18,525
Same contact lens as the one

00:15:18,525 --> 00:15:20,087
that we found
in Michael Wilson's room.

00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:21,795
They've sold 500 of these

00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:23,664
at this convention
in the last two days.

00:15:23,664 --> 00:15:25,087
Well, great. That's
impossible to trace.

00:15:25,087 --> 00:15:27,668
We'd better hope
DNA comes through.

00:15:27,668 --> 00:15:29,088
(sighs): Yeah.

00:15:29,088 --> 00:15:31,705
Wow.

00:15:31,705 --> 00:15:34,508
Cool eyes. Mom!

00:15:34,508 --> 00:15:36,043
I need your credit card.

00:15:36,043 --> 00:15:38,512
I think you just turned another
one over to the dark side.

00:15:38,512 --> 00:15:40,481
(chuckles)

00:15:41,087 --> 00:15:43,951
That's nice... nice...

00:15:43,951 --> 00:15:45,385
Remember, you're undead.

00:15:45,385 --> 00:15:46,386
Ow.

00:15:47,688 --> 00:15:50,085
STOKES:
So you think
it's the neck biting,

00:15:50,085 --> 00:15:51,425
the bloodsucking,

00:15:51,425 --> 00:15:53,080
or the carnal sex
that's the appeal?

00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,081
LANGSTON:
It's probably all of the above.

00:15:55,081 --> 00:15:56,463
Once you mate,
it's for life.

00:15:56,463 --> 00:15:59,399
You know, if it's worth,
uh, living for...

00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:03,937
...it's also worth
dying for.

00:16:05,079 --> 00:16:06,740
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Wiccans...

00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,876
bring your best
spells and potions

00:16:08,876 --> 00:16:13,580
to the sharing circle,
when the hour strikes...

00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:16,084
STOKES:
Whew! That's quite an arsenal.

00:16:16,084 --> 00:16:19,820
I didn't realize that vampires
and werewolves needed weapons.

00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,084
Oh, they don't. You do.

00:16:23,085 --> 00:16:24,424
Back to work, honey.

00:16:24,424 --> 00:16:26,860
Don't flirt with the dogs.

00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,082
It's slay or be slayed
out there.

00:16:29,082 --> 00:16:30,088
So have you ever
used one of

00:16:30,088 --> 00:16:32,499
these weapons to, uh,
slay a vampire yourself?

00:16:32,499 --> 00:16:34,601
(chuckles)

00:16:34,601 --> 00:16:36,080
If these blades could talk.

00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,838
No, but seriously,

00:16:37,838 --> 00:16:39,082
can I tell
you guys something?

00:16:40,941 --> 00:16:43,544
I'm a direct descendant
of the great Van Helsing.

00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:44,545
Really?

00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,580
Yeah. So...

00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,782
Ridding the world of monsters
is in my blood.

00:16:49,816 --> 00:16:52,079
I've seen the evil
they can do.

00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,389
Killing machines, really.
No conscience, no mercy.

00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,858
So what kind of weapon
would you recommend

00:16:57,858 --> 00:17:00,727
to, say, decapitate
a vampire?

00:17:00,727 --> 00:17:03,730
Ooh, I like how you think.

00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:08,735
I would go with
the TransVlad 5000.

00:17:08,735 --> 00:17:10,671
Top o' the line.

00:17:10,671 --> 00:17:12,940
Stainless steel,
leather-wrapped handle,

00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:15,086
And how much does
that set you back?

00:17:15,086 --> 00:17:17,087
Well, for you young slayers,

00:17:17,087 --> 00:17:18,412
I could do...

00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:19,746
450 bucks.

00:17:19,746 --> 00:17:22,079
Yeah. Kinda steep.
That's a little pricey.

00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,917
Well, why don't you let
me<i>slashthe price?!</i>

00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:25,419
$425, just for today.

00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:28,084
We were thinking of something
more along the lines of

00:17:28,084 --> 00:17:30,084
the axe or hatchet family?

00:17:30,084 --> 00:17:31,858
I get it.

00:17:31,858 --> 00:17:33,660
You guys are on
some kind of budget.

00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,084
You're not yanking
my chain here.

00:17:35,084 --> 00:17:36,563
You're not wasting my time?

00:17:36,563 --> 00:17:37,698
'Cause I might have to...

00:17:37,698 --> 00:17:39,967
(makes slicing noise)
...decapitate you!

00:17:39,967 --> 00:17:41,081
I'm just kidding.

00:17:41,081 --> 00:17:42,769
Honey, can you get me
the wood axe?

00:17:44,972 --> 00:17:47,007
(muttering)

00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:50,510
If he doesn't die, he'll-he'll
have to get a tetanus shot.

00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:51,812
No, but seriously,
this might

00:17:51,812 --> 00:17:54,085
do the trick on your entry-level
blood junkies,

00:17:54,085 --> 00:17:56,917
but, uh, no guarantees.

00:17:56,917 --> 00:17:59,920
And... (makes stabbing noise)...
no returns.

00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:04,079
Heavy head, curved blade
about five inches long.

00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:05,492
How many of these
have you sold?

00:18:05,492 --> 00:18:06,727
None.

00:18:06,727 --> 00:18:08,595
People usually go
for the crossbows,

00:18:08,595 --> 00:18:10,079
or the... or the scimitars.

00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:13,734
They don't go for something
you could get at Home Depot.

00:18:13,734 --> 00:18:15,669
We'll take it.
We'll take it.

00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:32,653
(laughs):
Oh, man.

00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,082
Sorry.

00:18:34,082 --> 00:18:37,083
That's okay,
this shirt was begging for it.

00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,425
Recreating the event, I see.

00:18:38,425 --> 00:18:41,762
Analyzing tool marks
and blood spatter.

00:18:41,762 --> 00:18:43,030
According to Doc Robbins,

00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:45,080
Michael Wilson was struck
no less than 18 times.

00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,933
How many you up to?
About 11.

00:18:46,933 --> 00:18:48,935
I keep trying to hit
the same place twice,

00:18:48,935 --> 00:18:50,637
but every time I miss,

00:18:50,637 --> 00:18:53,081
I have to start over again,
and my hand is killing me.

00:18:53,081 --> 00:18:54,941
Want to let me
give it a whack?

00:18:54,941 --> 00:18:57,079
All right.

00:18:58,845 --> 00:19:01,748
You know my PawPaw used to say
the great thing about wood

00:19:01,748 --> 00:19:03,016
is it warms you up twice:

00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:04,685
once when you chop it,
and once when you burn it.

00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,088
(chuckles)

00:19:16,763 --> 00:19:18,532
That's my five, your 11,

00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:20,080
that makes 16.

00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,802
I think we shaved a couple
off the killer's total.

00:19:24,571 --> 00:19:26,873
Come take a look at this
with me, will you?

00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,079
The victim was struck
from all sides.

00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:38,919
That's very
difficult to do

00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:40,721
with a guy
who's chained to a fence.

00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,456
That would mean the killer
hopped the fence,

00:19:42,456 --> 00:19:44,858
so he could take shots
from the other side.

00:19:56,837 --> 00:19:57,838
(groans)

00:19:57,838 --> 00:19:59,840
Why do that?
We just proved

00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,509
you can get the job done
standing in the same spot.

00:20:02,509 --> 00:20:04,079
Maybe he
didn't know that.

00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:06,080
There is another
possibility.

00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,080
Maybe he
wasn't alone.

00:20:15,021 --> 00:20:17,491
HODGES:
That's a hair we found
in your victim's mouth.

00:20:17,491 --> 00:20:19,079
Scale patterns
are mosaic.

00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:21,079
It's not human.

00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:24,898
I ran it against
this exemplar.

00:20:24,898 --> 00:20:27,085
<i>Canis lupus.</i>

00:20:27,085 --> 00:20:28,735
Wolf hair?

00:20:28,735 --> 00:20:30,704
Or, maybe... werewolf.

00:20:30,704 --> 00:20:33,874
I have been doing
extensive research.

00:20:33,874 --> 00:20:36,088
According to the legend,
vampires enslaved werewolves

00:20:36,088 --> 00:20:37,844
during the Trajanic War.

00:20:37,844 --> 00:20:40,881
Werewolves revolted, and they've
been mortal enemies ever since.

00:20:40,881 --> 00:20:42,849
Like Cain and Abel.

00:20:42,849 --> 00:20:44,083
Romulus and Remus.

00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,552
Tom and Jerry.
I get it.

00:20:45,552 --> 00:20:48,083
There were a lot of werewolves
at that convention.

00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:52,392
But as scientists, we know
that wannabe werewolves

00:20:52,392 --> 00:20:54,928
cannot physically transform
themselves into wolves.

00:20:54,928 --> 00:20:56,530
So, where did this
hair come from?

00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:59,666
Perhaps one of them
has a four-legged companion.

00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:01,435
They say that people
look like their dogs.

00:21:01,435 --> 00:21:04,087
Greg's running canine
CODIS right now.

00:21:04,087 --> 00:21:05,539
Thank you.

00:21:05,539 --> 00:21:08,608
Um, out of curiosity--
uh, will you

00:21:08,608 --> 00:21:11,079
and Detective Vartann
be sharing your house

00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:12,412
or his?

00:21:12,412 --> 00:21:13,647
Really none of your business.

00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:17,079
I had love in my grasp,

00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:19,753
and I let it slip
through my fingers,

00:21:19,753 --> 00:21:24,081
and I don't know if I'll
ever be able to forgive myself.

00:21:25,959 --> 00:21:28,628
It's a terrible thing
to wake up to every day.

00:21:30,864 --> 00:21:33,867
I'll... keep that in mind.

00:21:37,804 --> 00:21:39,606
Your wolf's in the system.

00:21:39,606 --> 00:21:41,084
His name's Timber.

00:21:41,084 --> 00:21:42,609
WILLOWS:
Hmm, how original.

00:21:42,609 --> 00:21:44,611
He was entered into
canine CODIS two years ago,

00:21:44,611 --> 00:21:47,914
when his owner assaulted someone
in front of the Tangiers.

00:21:47,914 --> 00:21:50,484
Timber, here,
joined in on the fight.

00:21:50,484 --> 00:21:51,618
Wolves don't normally
attack humans.

00:21:51,618 --> 00:21:52,886
Blame the owner, not the wolf.

00:21:52,886 --> 00:21:54,554
Who's the owner?

00:21:54,554 --> 00:21:56,086
Kurt Francis.
He's also in the system.

00:21:56,086 --> 00:21:59,392
Multiple assaults,
drunk and disorderly, DUI...

00:21:59,392 --> 00:22:01,081
SANDERS:
He's registered
at the convention.

00:22:01,081 --> 00:22:03,530
He's the leader
of a werewolf pack.

00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:06,466
Well, we're looking
for multiple attackers.

00:22:06,466 --> 00:22:08,468
SIDLE:
Wolves do hunt in packs.

00:22:08,468 --> 00:22:10,470
Maybe werewolves do, too.

00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:13,540
(low growls, laughter)
MAN: Get your glasses up.
Come on. Come on.

00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,082
Looks like we need
another round.
Sorry.

00:22:16,082 --> 00:22:18,745
Who's buying
another round?

00:22:18,745 --> 00:22:20,714
Yo, yo, check her out.
(howls)

00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:22,549
Sorry, guys...

00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:25,852
That is a nice
piece of meat. Mm.

00:22:25,852 --> 00:22:27,921
MAN: You're right,
Kurtis. Sweet!

00:22:33,026 --> 00:22:35,088
How about it, honey?
How about a lap dance?

00:22:35,088 --> 00:22:36,696
Whoa, whoa.

00:22:36,696 --> 00:22:38,498
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where you going?

00:22:38,498 --> 00:22:39,900
Come on!
(indistinct shouts, laughter)

00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,401
WOMAN:
No! Get your hands off of me!

00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:43,086
Come on! Ah!

00:22:43,086 --> 00:22:45,005
You're hurting me!
Get your hands off of her.

00:22:45,005 --> 00:22:47,084
What do you think you're doing
with that stick, old man?

00:22:47,084 --> 00:22:50,010
STOKES:
Relax, relax, relax.
Everybody be cool now.

00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:51,081
Be cool now, boys.

00:22:51,081 --> 00:22:53,647
Just relax.
Move it along,
old man.

00:22:53,647 --> 00:22:55,086
What is that?

00:22:55,086 --> 00:22:56,683
Is that wolf hair?

00:22:58,086 --> 00:22:59,786
STOKES:
Back up!

00:22:59,786 --> 00:23:00,921
Back up!

00:23:01,955 --> 00:23:03,490
Back up!

00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,493
The hold I have you in

00:23:06,493 --> 00:23:09,086
is called a lateral
vascular hold.

00:23:09,086 --> 00:23:11,088
The discomfort you're feeling

00:23:11,088 --> 00:23:13,083
is my forefinger
and thumb

00:23:13,083 --> 00:23:14,801
constricting your airway,

00:23:14,801 --> 00:23:17,037
cutting off the oxygen
to your brain.

00:23:17,037 --> 00:23:20,083
(gasping)
You should pass out

00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:21,675
right about...

00:23:21,675 --> 00:23:23,009
now.

00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:29,382
Why don't one of you
take these chains off of me

00:23:29,382 --> 00:23:30,417
and give me my vest back?

00:23:30,417 --> 00:23:32,080
Well, you can't have it back.

00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,553
You know,
when I was a kid,

00:23:33,553 --> 00:23:35,789
we had a dog,
and when he died

00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:39,459
we never once considered
turning him into a jacket.

00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:40,927
Eh, never.

00:23:40,927 --> 00:23:43,084
Timber was a loyal member
of the pack.

00:23:43,084 --> 00:23:45,432
I wanted to keep him with me.

00:23:45,432 --> 00:23:48,087
We found some of Timber's hair
in the teeth of a murder victim,

00:23:48,087 --> 00:23:49,603
Michael Wilson.

00:23:49,603 --> 00:23:50,604
Who?

00:23:50,604 --> 00:23:51,705
Michael Wilson.

00:23:51,705 --> 00:23:53,640
He was at your convention--
he was of

00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,081
the vampire persuasion.
Well, I don't hang
with parasites.

00:23:56,081 --> 00:23:57,085
Well, you should think about it.

00:23:57,085 --> 00:23:58,778
I mean, you have
a lot in common.

00:23:58,778 --> 00:24:00,547
You're in the same movies.

00:24:00,547 --> 00:24:02,087
LANGSTON:
You know,
there's a creature

00:24:02,087 --> 00:24:04,918
in the Philippines
called an<i>aswang.</i>

00:24:04,918 --> 00:24:06,486
A what?
<i>Aswang.</i>

00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:08,086
It's a half-breed.

00:24:08,086 --> 00:24:09,489
Half vampire, half werewolf.

00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:13,460
We are nothing like
those bloodsuckers.

00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:16,696
There's a reason why
they hide in the dark, you know?

00:24:16,696 --> 00:24:18,082
Act like the elite.

00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:20,800
Pretend to be, uh...

00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,469
refined.

00:24:22,469 --> 00:24:25,081
You see, us animals...

00:24:25,081 --> 00:24:27,507
we're honest.

00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:30,410
We follow our instincts.

00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:32,779
We give in to our urges.

00:24:32,779 --> 00:24:34,581
Like the urge to kill.

00:24:34,581 --> 00:24:36,085
We found a contact lens

00:24:36,085 --> 00:24:37,917
in Michael Wilson's hotel room.

00:24:37,917 --> 00:24:39,486
The DNA says it's yours.

00:24:41,621 --> 00:24:42,622
Kurt.

00:24:44,086 --> 00:24:46,087
I think you're taking
this mortal enemy thing

00:24:46,087 --> 00:24:47,627
a little too far.

00:24:47,627 --> 00:24:51,083
Now, where were you
two nights ago?

00:24:51,083 --> 00:24:53,083
I don't remember.

00:24:53,083 --> 00:24:55,935
There was a full moon,
and I shifted.

00:24:57,082 --> 00:24:58,872
You shifted?
When there's
a full moon,

00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:00,974
<i>I'mnot as strong,</i>

00:25:00,974 --> 00:25:02,876
<i>Ican't control it.</i>

00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,878
(hits table with cane)

00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:08,381
Can you remember where you were
when the sun came up?

00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:10,984
I was in my car.

00:25:10,984 --> 00:25:13,079
Where was your car?

00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:16,890
Self-park garage
at the Mediterranean,

00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:17,991
level three.

00:25:17,991 --> 00:25:20,086
(quietly):
Good dog.

00:25:22,495 --> 00:25:23,963
SIDLE:
This car is a gas guzzler.

00:25:23,963 --> 00:25:25,084
You'd think a wolf

00:25:25,084 --> 00:25:27,567
would be more
environmentally conscious.

00:25:29,936 --> 00:25:31,604
Oh...

00:25:32,772 --> 00:25:35,082
I think I know why Kurt Francis

00:25:35,082 --> 00:25:37,777
couldn't remember
what happened last night.

00:25:37,777 --> 00:25:39,512
That pooch has been
hitting the hooch.

00:25:39,512 --> 00:25:41,414
It's not the moonlight
that turns them

00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:44,082
into a beast,
it's the moonshine.

00:25:45,485 --> 00:25:47,787
SIDLE:
Got some dog collars.

00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,425
Similar pattern
to the ligature marks.

00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:53,593
It's probable

00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:55,829
that Kurt and his pack
used these

00:25:55,829 --> 00:25:57,997
to restrain
Michael Wilson.

00:25:57,997 --> 00:25:59,733
SANDERS:
There's spatter

00:25:59,733 --> 00:26:01,434
on the passenger door.

00:26:09,476 --> 00:26:11,578
Positive for blood.

00:26:11,578 --> 00:26:13,613
<i>The truck might</i>
<i>have been parked</i>

00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:16,416
<i>near the fence when</i>
<i>they were killing Michael.</i>

00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:21,088
Well, there's blood
in the window well, too.

00:26:21,088 --> 00:26:23,080
A lot of it.

00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,088
The window must have been open.

00:26:25,088 --> 00:26:28,086
Then why isn't there any blood

00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:30,086
inside the truck,
on the seats?

00:26:30,086 --> 00:26:32,080
What is that smell?

00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,083
Vomit. Is that really what
we're gonna talk about

00:26:35,083 --> 00:26:36,469
right now, man?
I'm eating.

00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:38,088
Well, you're always eating.

00:26:38,088 --> 00:26:39,405
You were saying?

00:26:39,405 --> 00:26:41,007
The blood on
Kurt Francis's truck

00:26:41,007 --> 00:26:42,408
came back to the vic.

00:26:42,408 --> 00:26:44,944
But mixed in with it
were traces of pepsinogen

00:26:44,944 --> 00:26:46,045
and hydrochloric acid.

00:26:46,045 --> 00:26:48,515
STOKES:
Digestive enzymes.

00:26:48,515 --> 00:26:50,083
Yeah, someone drank
Michael Wilson's blood

00:26:50,083 --> 00:26:52,018
and then puked it
out the window.

00:26:52,018 --> 00:26:54,988
Yeah, Kurt Francis.
No. It did not come back
to Kurt Francis.

00:26:57,085 --> 00:26:59,085
Of course-- a vampire.

00:26:59,085 --> 00:27:03,084
If we accept the mythology,
werewolves don't drink blood,

00:27:03,084 --> 00:27:04,664
vampires do.

00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:06,082
So, what was

00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:08,086
a vampire doing
in Kurt Francis's truck?

00:27:08,086 --> 00:27:10,470
Don't they hate
each other?
Mm-hmm.

00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:12,605
I can't tell you
why they were carpooling,

00:27:12,605 --> 00:27:13,840
but I can tell you

00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,509
that the vampire
we're looking for is sick.

00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:18,511
Hodges found traces of hematin

00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:19,813
and mesoporphyrin

00:27:19,813 --> 00:27:21,082
in the vomit.

00:27:21,082 --> 00:27:23,516
Both of those are used
to treat porphyria.

00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:25,752
It's a blood disorder;
it's also known

00:27:25,752 --> 00:27:27,787
as the "vampire disease."
Well, you know,

00:27:27,787 --> 00:27:29,455
we had a case
about ten years ago

00:27:29,455 --> 00:27:30,523
where the killer had porphyria.

00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:32,080
Remember?
She chopped up

00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,494
her victims and turned them
into protein shakes.

00:27:34,494 --> 00:27:36,081
(gags, coughs)

00:27:36,081 --> 00:27:37,530
(laughs)
I'm sorry, man.

00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:38,965
(coughs)
It's all right.

00:27:38,965 --> 00:27:40,667
So we're not

00:27:40,667 --> 00:27:42,535
just looking
for a vampire poser.

00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:45,471
We're looking
for a sanguinarian.

00:27:49,008 --> 00:27:51,081
THOMAS:
By sharing our blood
with Michael,

00:27:51,081 --> 00:27:53,646
he takes a part of each
of us into the next world.

00:27:53,646 --> 00:27:55,481
It's one in life, one in death.

00:27:55,481 --> 00:27:56,916
It's how we honor our dead.

00:27:56,916 --> 00:27:59,619
Well, may a stranger
offer a few words?

00:27:59,619 --> 00:28:00,987
Uh, no, actually.
Thank you.

00:28:00,987 --> 00:28:02,755
Thank you.

00:28:02,755 --> 00:28:06,080
Michael lived and died as...

00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,827
a vampire.

00:28:07,827 --> 00:28:09,762
A being hated
for centuries.

00:28:09,762 --> 00:28:11,731
Hatred is born of fear,

00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:14,079
fear of things
we don't understand.

00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:16,603
In medieval times, for example,

00:28:16,603 --> 00:28:19,005
when someone saw
a bloated corpse with blood

00:28:19,005 --> 00:28:22,508
running from its mouth,
they believed it was a vampire

00:28:22,508 --> 00:28:23,910
such as yourselves.

00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,511
Science now teaches us

00:28:25,511 --> 00:28:28,083
that that's just part
of the decomposition process.

00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:30,817
It's simply
gasses purging fluids

00:28:30,817 --> 00:28:33,419
from the body through the nose
and from the mouth.

00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:35,084
This is highly inappropriate
at a memorial service.

00:28:35,084 --> 00:28:37,690
STOKES:
You know, you're right, Thomas.

00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:39,082
This is a somber occasion,
Dr. Ray.

00:28:39,082 --> 00:28:41,083
Maybe we should
lighten things up a little bit.

00:28:41,083 --> 00:28:42,595
Maybe we should.

00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:45,531
LANGSTON:
What does it say in
the Good Book, Nick?

00:28:45,531 --> 00:28:46,432
"Let there be light."

00:28:46,432 --> 00:28:48,568
(others gasping)

00:28:51,083 --> 00:28:54,607
Science has a way of
revealing other truths

00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:56,085
about vampires.

00:28:56,085 --> 00:28:58,478
Like... your acute sensitivity

00:28:58,478 --> 00:28:59,646
to sunlight.

00:28:59,646 --> 00:29:01,082
It's actually

00:29:01,082 --> 00:29:03,583
a symptom of a medical condition

00:29:03,583 --> 00:29:04,817
called porphyria.

00:29:06,686 --> 00:29:08,655
Even...

00:29:08,655 --> 00:29:10,087
brief exposure

00:29:10,087 --> 00:29:14,085
to sunlight
can cause your skin to...

00:29:15,088 --> 00:29:17,030
...burn...

00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:19,082
and blister.

00:29:20,433 --> 00:29:22,835
STOKES:
The great thing about science

00:29:22,835 --> 00:29:25,004
is that it always sheds light
on the subject.

00:29:26,606 --> 00:29:27,941
I didn't kill Michael.

00:29:27,941 --> 00:29:29,909
When I found him,
he was already dead.

00:29:29,909 --> 00:29:31,044
So you thought,

00:29:31,044 --> 00:29:33,046
why let all that good blood
go to waste?

00:29:33,046 --> 00:29:35,086
You know,
I take offense to that.
You said yourself

00:29:35,086 --> 00:29:37,517
that your coven
doesn't drink blood.
No, we don't.

00:29:37,517 --> 00:29:39,485
I made an exception
for Michael.

00:29:39,485 --> 00:29:40,787
Why?

00:29:40,787 --> 00:29:43,456
Because I wanted his soul
to live on through me.

00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:46,083
They lured him

00:29:46,083 --> 00:29:47,087
to the mountain.

00:29:47,087 --> 00:29:49,696
I tried to get there
in time to save him,

00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:51,431
but I was too late.
Yeah? Who's "they"?

00:29:51,431 --> 00:29:52,966
Wolves.

00:29:52,966 --> 00:29:55,468
They had their
noses open that night.

00:29:55,468 --> 00:29:58,538
You know, there's only one
problem with your story, Thomas.

00:29:58,538 --> 00:29:59,839
You hitched a ride

00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,087
back to town with the leader

00:30:01,087 --> 00:30:03,081
of the wolf pack.
The evidence
tells us

00:30:03,081 --> 00:30:04,544
that you and Kurt Francis

00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:06,079
killed Michael
together.

00:30:14,487 --> 00:30:16,088
See, the thing about
drinking human blood is,

00:30:16,088 --> 00:30:19,525
our bodies lack the enzymes
to break it down properly.

00:30:19,525 --> 00:30:20,693
It induces vomiting.

00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:22,528
I understand
why the werewolves

00:30:22,528 --> 00:30:24,087
would want Michael
dead, but...

00:30:24,087 --> 00:30:26,933
why would<i>heturn against</i>
one of his own?

00:30:26,933 --> 00:30:29,035
Maybe Michael
lost faith.

00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:31,437
Maybe Michael started to see you

00:30:31,437 --> 00:30:33,083
for what you
really are:

00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:36,809
a frustrated Web site
designer from London.

00:30:36,809 --> 00:30:38,086
Or maybe it was about the girl.

00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:40,088
Julie.

00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:43,085
You wanted her
all to yourself, didn't you?

00:30:46,086 --> 00:30:48,921
I want a lawyer.

00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,425
LANGSTON:
<i>The yellow contact lens</i>

00:30:52,425 --> 00:30:54,594
puts Kurt Francis in
Michael Wilson's hotel room.

00:30:54,594 --> 00:30:55,995
Michael's blood
in Kurt's car

00:30:55,995 --> 00:30:58,564
puts him at the crime scene
along with Thomas Stewart.

00:30:58,564 --> 00:31:00,566
But without the murder
weapon, we can't prove

00:31:00,566 --> 00:31:02,081
that either of them
killed Michael.

00:31:02,081 --> 00:31:04,871
Right.<i>Butwhen Nick and I</i>
hacked off Jell-O Man's head,

00:31:04,871 --> 00:31:06,081
we were covered with blood.

00:31:06,081 --> 00:31:08,775
So if Kurt and Thomas
hacked off Michael's head...

00:31:08,775 --> 00:31:10,087
The clothes
should prove it.

00:31:10,087 --> 00:31:11,444
They should.

00:31:11,444 --> 00:31:14,714
♪ ♪

00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:49,082
♪ ♪

00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,085
You know, there should be
a lot more blood than this.

00:32:05,085 --> 00:32:07,767
WILLOWS:
Could be castoff from
simply being at the scene.

00:32:07,767 --> 00:32:08,835
All it proves

00:32:08,835 --> 00:32:10,603
is that Kurt and Thomas
were there.

00:32:10,603 --> 00:32:12,004
SIDLE:
Well, at the<i>least,</i>
they were there.

00:32:12,004 --> 00:32:14,082
If they only took
one or two swings,

00:32:14,082 --> 00:32:15,808
that could account
for the lack of blood.

00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:17,777
He was hit with an axe
at least 18 times,

00:32:17,777 --> 00:32:19,081
so whether they were just there

00:32:19,081 --> 00:32:21,447
or they took a couple of swings,
it means that someone else

00:32:21,447 --> 00:32:24,517
took the rest
of the swings.
Yeah. Yeah, another wolf.

00:32:24,517 --> 00:32:26,080
Or another vampire.

00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,722
HODGES:
I admit that a black cloak
does lend a gentleman

00:32:29,722 --> 00:32:31,557
a certain kind
of mysterious allure.

00:32:31,557 --> 00:32:32,992
There's just one drawback--

00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:35,428
it drags along the ground
and collects plenty of trace.

00:32:35,428 --> 00:32:38,079
What did you find, David?
Alpine rock butterweed.

00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:41,086
It's a flowering herb
that only grows above 2,500 feet

00:32:41,086 --> 00:32:43,803
on Mount Charleston
along the south loop trail.

00:32:43,803 --> 00:32:46,572
We didn't find any of this stuff
at the crime scene.

00:32:46,572 --> 00:32:49,086
Makes me wonder what
else is up there.

00:32:49,086 --> 00:32:51,079
SIDLE:
We know that Michael was
running from his attackers.

00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:53,087
We know that the chase ended

00:32:53,087 --> 00:32:54,714
at the fence.

00:32:54,714 --> 00:32:56,086
Where did it begin?

00:33:04,088 --> 00:33:07,081
Did you know that a 12-letter
word for "across the woods"

00:33:07,081 --> 00:33:08,087
is "Transylvania"?

00:33:08,087 --> 00:33:10,083
Grissom?

00:33:10,083 --> 00:33:11,083
Is that you, Grissom?

00:33:11,083 --> 00:33:12,083
Shut up.

00:33:12,083 --> 00:33:13,766
Gil?

00:33:13,766 --> 00:33:15,601
I don't think he'd appreciate
you calling him that either.

00:33:15,601 --> 00:33:16,702
No, you don't
think so?

00:33:16,702 --> 00:33:17,703
I don't.

00:33:17,703 --> 00:33:18,871
After all this time.

00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:20,473
That's a shame.

00:33:20,473 --> 00:33:22,975
All right, here you go.

00:33:22,975 --> 00:33:24,083
I'll see you at 2,500.

00:33:24,083 --> 00:33:27,088
If you can keep up.

00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:29,482
(chuckles)

00:33:29,482 --> 00:33:30,683
(groans)

00:33:39,087 --> 00:33:41,394
SIDLE:
Alpine rock butterweed.

00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:42,595
STOKES:
Mm-hmm.

00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:52,079
Big fat tire treads,

00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:54,707
consistent with Kurt's
gas guzzler of a truck.

00:33:55,708 --> 00:33:58,080
Got something here.

00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:05,818
Dirt's been
disturbed.

00:34:16,495 --> 00:34:19,398
Another piece.

00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:26,079
I know this guy.

00:34:27,707 --> 00:34:29,742
That's Kurt Francis.

00:34:36,088 --> 00:34:38,484
I can beat that.
Yeah?

00:34:41,787 --> 00:34:44,657
I think somebody tried
to bury the hatchet.

00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,086
STOKES:
<i>This photo was taken</i>
<i>at last year's</i>

00:34:50,086 --> 00:34:51,397
convention.

00:34:51,397 --> 00:34:53,032
Do you recognize
the werewolf

00:34:53,032 --> 00:34:55,079
standing next
to Kurt Francis?

00:34:57,937 --> 00:34:59,438
How about now?

00:34:59,438 --> 00:35:00,806
Michael Wilson.

00:35:00,806 --> 00:35:02,041
He was part

00:35:02,041 --> 00:35:04,080
of Kurt's wolf pack?

00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,080
Looks that way.

00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,879
I think
Michael was

00:35:06,879 --> 00:35:09,515
a wolf who fell for a vampire,

00:35:09,515 --> 00:35:11,082
but the only way
he could have her

00:35:11,082 --> 00:35:12,785
was to become a vampire himself

00:35:12,785 --> 00:35:14,020
and hope
that nobody recognized him

00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:16,081
from last year's
convention.

00:35:16,081 --> 00:35:17,490
WILLOWS:
<i>Well, someone obviously</i>
<i>recognized him</i>

00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:19,625
<i>and that someone</i>
<i>was Kurt Francis.</i>

00:35:19,625 --> 00:35:21,694
STOKES:
<i>He followed Michael</i>

00:35:21,694 --> 00:35:23,763
<i>to his room, he confronted him,</i>

00:35:23,763 --> 00:35:26,083
<i>and he got in his face.</i>

00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:28,081
Once a werewolf,
always a werewolf, Michael.

00:35:28,081 --> 00:35:30,436
We were brothers.
You betrayed us for one of them!

00:35:30,436 --> 00:35:31,937
(grunting)

00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:38,411
My guess is that Kurt
went looking for Thomas

00:35:38,411 --> 00:35:42,014
to let him know that there
was a traitor in his midst.

00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:45,551
And for one night
and one night only,

00:35:45,551 --> 00:35:47,086
they joined forces
to kill a common enemy.

00:35:49,989 --> 00:35:53,086
Fluorescein green.

00:35:53,086 --> 00:35:55,086
Enhances contrast

00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:58,030
in latent blood.

00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,532
Excellent choice.

00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:02,735
Thank you.

00:36:02,735 --> 00:36:04,670
The handle's
been wiped clean,

00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:06,505
but they didn't get
all the blood.

00:36:06,505 --> 00:36:08,541
There's some patterns
in the wood.

00:36:09,775 --> 00:36:11,088
Huh.

00:36:14,847 --> 00:36:17,084
I think I've seen this before.

00:36:22,822 --> 00:36:25,085
Look at this.

00:36:25,085 --> 00:36:27,088
This is the test axe that Nick
and I used on Jell-O Man.

00:36:27,088 --> 00:36:28,088
Hmm.

00:36:28,088 --> 00:36:30,696
See the pattern?

00:36:30,696 --> 00:36:32,031
Similar markings.

00:36:32,031 --> 00:36:33,766
Right.
But not the same.

00:36:33,766 --> 00:36:34,967
They came from this.

00:36:34,967 --> 00:36:37,503
My, uh, my wedding ring
made a pattern

00:36:37,503 --> 00:36:39,672
in blood on the handle.

00:36:39,672 --> 00:36:43,876
Kurt Francis wears a ring
that has a wolf insignia.

00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:47,880
(camera clicking)

00:37:12,805 --> 00:37:14,807
That doesn't look

00:37:14,807 --> 00:37:16,475
like a wolf to me.

00:37:21,082 --> 00:37:23,916
That's a beautiful
engagement ring.

00:37:23,916 --> 00:37:27,887
Thank you.

00:37:27,887 --> 00:37:32,458
It's designed to fit
your wedding band, yes?

00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:34,727
May I?

00:37:37,496 --> 00:37:41,867
And the two halves
become one.

00:37:43,903 --> 00:37:46,038
Michael and I liked
the symbolism.

00:37:47,085 --> 00:37:49,775
The idea that we'd be
together forever.

00:37:49,775 --> 00:37:53,879
Well, we like symbols, too.

00:37:53,879 --> 00:37:56,482
They have a way
of making an impression,

00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:58,384
especially in blood.

00:37:58,384 --> 00:38:00,820
LANGSTON:
When you were swinging
that axe at Michael's head

00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,088
again and again,

00:38:03,088 --> 00:38:05,524
his blood seeped onto
the handle of the axe,

00:38:05,524 --> 00:38:09,082
and your ring left behind
an unusual pattern.

00:38:09,082 --> 00:38:13,699
You got his blood all over you,
on your clothes, in your hair.

00:38:13,699 --> 00:38:15,701
LANGSTON:
CSIs are searching your
hotel room right now.

00:38:15,701 --> 00:38:17,087
Even if you washed
your clothes,

00:38:17,087 --> 00:38:18,704
even if you
took a shower,

00:38:18,704 --> 00:38:22,875
they'll find evidence
of his blood there.

00:38:22,875 --> 00:38:26,679
Michael never told you
that he used to be a werewolf,

00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:28,647
did he?

00:38:31,984 --> 00:38:33,083
How did you find out?

00:38:36,589 --> 00:38:40,493
Thomas told Michael and me to
meet him at Mount Charleston for

00:38:40,493 --> 00:38:42,461
a pre-wedding ritual.

00:38:42,461 --> 00:38:45,598
As soon as we got there,
I knew something was wrong.

00:38:52,084 --> 00:38:53,906
<i>Thomas ordered Michael</i>
<i>to hand over</i>

00:38:53,906 --> 00:38:56,080
<i>his contacts and his fangs.</i>

00:38:59,411 --> 00:39:00,087
What are they doing here?

00:39:01,914 --> 00:39:03,079
Michael?

00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:05,551
<i>Michael ran</i>
<i>and they ran after him,</i>

00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:07,453
and by the time I caught up,

00:39:07,453 --> 00:39:09,555
they had chained Michael
to a fence.

00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:11,023
(Michael screams)
JULIE:
Stop!

00:39:11,023 --> 00:39:12,391
Let me go!

00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:14,083
Do something,
help him.
Show her.

00:39:14,083 --> 00:39:15,861
MICHAEL:
Don't, stop!

00:39:15,861 --> 00:39:19,084
Your beloved
used to be
a werewolf.

00:39:22,868 --> 00:39:26,739
Michael said he'd seen me
at the convention last year.

00:39:28,841 --> 00:39:31,610
Said he knew we were destined
to be together.

00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:32,778
So he changed

00:39:32,778 --> 00:39:35,814
who he was because he loved you.

00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:41,887
Love built on a lie isn't love.

00:39:44,723 --> 00:39:47,088
You can't be someone you're not.

00:39:49,695 --> 00:39:51,931
He wasn't one of us.

00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:54,934
And that didn't sit
well with anyone.

00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:56,080
Did it?

00:39:58,037 --> 00:39:59,085
THOMAS:
Traitors must die.

00:39:59,085 --> 00:40:00,472
MICHAEL:
Julie, I love you.

00:40:00,472 --> 00:40:02,408
It doesn't matter
what side I'm on!

00:40:02,408 --> 00:40:04,043
He's not on any side.

00:40:04,043 --> 00:40:05,084
He's not one of us,

00:40:05,084 --> 00:40:06,084
he's never been one of us,

00:40:06,084 --> 00:40:07,088
and he's not
even one of them.

00:40:07,088 --> 00:40:08,581
Now, you align yourself

00:40:08,581 --> 00:40:09,949
to this man,

00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:11,517
that makes you
no better than him.

00:40:11,517 --> 00:40:14,453
We're all
watching, Julie.

00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:16,021
Choose.

00:40:16,021 --> 00:40:18,857
(Michael grunting)

00:40:18,857 --> 00:40:20,081
MICHAEL:
Julie.

00:40:20,081 --> 00:40:22,728
Julie, this is
all make-believe.

00:40:22,728 --> 00:40:24,396
Vampires, werewolves.

00:40:24,396 --> 00:40:26,932
None of this
is real.

00:40:26,932 --> 00:40:30,936
My love for you--
that's what's real.

00:40:30,936 --> 00:40:33,405
We can just walk
away from all this.

00:40:33,405 --> 00:40:35,908
Do you really love me?

00:40:35,908 --> 00:40:38,811
Yes, with all my
heart, I love you.

00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:40,746
That was your mistake.

00:40:41,747 --> 00:40:44,383
You can't be you and love me.

00:40:44,383 --> 00:40:46,452
No, stop,
don't, no!

00:40:46,452 --> 00:40:49,922
(Julie yelling)

00:40:52,625 --> 00:40:55,080
If you agree
to testify

00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,496
against Thomas Stewart
and Kurt Francis,

00:40:57,496 --> 00:41:00,499
you may be able to avoid
the death penalty.

00:41:03,936 --> 00:41:06,005
I killed Michael.

00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:09,975
VARTANN:
<i>Maybe the, uh,</i>

00:41:09,975 --> 00:41:12,511
werewolf and vampire
can work out a peace treaty

00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:13,712
while they're sharing a cell.

00:41:13,712 --> 00:41:14,947
And Julie Crenshaw
will be spending

00:41:14,947 --> 00:41:17,079
her honeymoon behind bars.

00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:18,651
So much for love.

00:41:18,651 --> 00:41:21,420
Well, there's still hope
for the rest of us, I hope.

00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:22,821
(chuckles)

00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:25,924
You never did give me an answer.

00:41:30,596 --> 00:41:32,598
Okay.

00:41:32,598 --> 00:41:36,085
Look, if you don't want
to move in together,

00:41:36,085 --> 00:41:37,603
you know, I understand.

00:41:37,603 --> 00:41:39,605
Lou.

00:41:42,474 --> 00:41:46,712
I think that
what we have now

00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:49,081
is pretty awesome.

00:41:49,081 --> 00:41:50,081
Mm-hmm.

00:41:50,081 --> 00:41:51,450
And I just fear

00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:54,083
that if we were to
move in together,

00:41:54,083 --> 00:41:55,621
we're going to start
to argue about

00:41:55,621 --> 00:41:58,088
who forgot to unload
the dishwasher,

00:41:58,088 --> 00:41:59,925
all kinds of crap like that.

00:41:59,925 --> 00:42:01,760
Besides, we're
both armed.

00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,761
It could end badly.

00:42:02,761 --> 00:42:03,896
(chuckles)

00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:07,566
Yeah, but, uh...

00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:10,536
I'm willing to risk it.

00:42:12,938 --> 00:42:15,086
I'm not.

00:42:17,084 --> 00:42:21,046
Can't we just enjoy
what we've got now?

00:42:23,015 --> 00:42:25,079
Yeah.

00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:27,079
I'll take it.

00:42:29,621 --> 00:42:31,857
(ominous music plays)

00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:37,863
STOKES:
Man, I saw

00:42:37,863 --> 00:42:39,398
this movie when I
was about seven.

00:42:39,398 --> 00:42:40,766
Freaked me out.

00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:42,768
Really?
Yeah, that particular<i>Nosferatu...</i>

00:42:42,768 --> 00:42:44,970
(chuckling):
just... scared
me to death.

00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:46,872
(both chuckling)

00:42:46,872 --> 00:42:48,707
You know,
people invented stories

00:42:48,707 --> 00:42:50,084
about werewolves
and vampires

00:42:50,084 --> 00:42:53,612
to explain the evil
in the world.

00:42:53,612 --> 00:42:54,947
Couldn't believe
that people were capable

00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:57,549
of such terrible violence.

00:42:58,984 --> 00:43:01,088
Sometimes I can't even
believe it myself.

00:43:03,388 --> 00:43:07,083
But I suppose if there were
no evil in the world,

00:43:07,083 --> 00:43:09,661
we'd be out of a job.

00:43:10,662 --> 00:43:11,897
(beeping)

00:43:16,087 --> 00:43:18,670
Speak of the devil.

00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:21,081
Triple homicide
at the Tangiers.

00:43:22,541 --> 00:43:24,543
(sighs)

00:43:26,512 --> 00:43:29,033
Let's go hunt some monsters.
