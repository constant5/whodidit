00:00:10,662 --> 00:00:13,656
Baked Brie and
raspberry preserves.

00:00:13,656 --> 00:00:15,656
It's a delight for the
eye and the palate.

00:00:15,656 --> 00:00:17,066
(all laugh)

00:00:17,066 --> 00:00:19,535
Well, my wife doesn't
just shine onstage.
Oh...

00:00:19,535 --> 00:00:21,303
I told you,
the best restaurants in L.A.

00:00:21,303 --> 00:00:22,438
couldn't hold a candle
to Gloria.

00:00:22,438 --> 00:00:24,039
Oh, Phil.

00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:25,662
He has a much higher opinion
of my cooking than I do.

00:00:25,662 --> 00:00:27,209
(laughs)

00:00:27,209 --> 00:00:29,044
No, it really,
it's so, so sweet of you guys

00:00:29,044 --> 00:00:30,246
to invite us over.

00:00:30,246 --> 00:00:33,582
Since Will and I moved
to town, we've...

00:00:33,582 --> 00:00:35,584
had a hard time meeting people.

00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:36,659
Well, you just haven't
met the right ones.

00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:38,154
I'll say.
(laughs)

00:00:38,154 --> 00:00:39,658
(all laughing)

00:00:40,661 --> 00:00:43,659
Another drink-- you have to
allow a guest to do something.

00:00:43,659 --> 00:00:45,528
Oh, hell,
it's not a school night, huh?

00:00:45,528 --> 00:00:47,196
Oh... I don't have to drive.

00:00:47,196 --> 00:00:49,198
(Gloria laughs)

00:00:49,198 --> 00:00:50,658
GLORIA: Thank you.
PHIL: Thanks.

00:00:53,658 --> 00:00:55,658
(conversing quietly)

00:01:09,285 --> 00:01:11,287
(low murmurs)

00:01:16,192 --> 00:01:18,294
Oh, I must...

00:01:18,294 --> 00:01:19,658
I might have to skip the wine
at dinner.

00:01:19,658 --> 00:01:21,497
I mean...

00:01:21,497 --> 00:01:23,658
(laughs softly)

00:01:23,658 --> 00:01:25,100
Oh, that's a
beautiful ring.

00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,203
Thank you.
(laughs)

00:01:27,203 --> 00:01:28,660
Phil has great taste.

00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,658
Tell me, Gloria,

00:01:30,658 --> 00:01:32,208
how did you meet your husband?

00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:35,211
Oh, God, it's one of
those crazy stories. Um...

00:01:35,211 --> 00:01:39,148
blind date, and somewhere
midway through the evening,

00:01:39,148 --> 00:01:41,659
Phil and I realized
that we weren't the ones

00:01:41,659 --> 00:01:43,658
the host was trying to set up.
(laughs)

00:01:43,658 --> 00:01:44,660
I meant Ray.

00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:46,589
How did you meet Ray?

00:01:49,491 --> 00:01:51,293
Who... who the hell are you?

00:01:51,293 --> 00:01:52,659
(Gloria whimpers)

00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:54,563
(Phil mutters)

00:01:54,563 --> 00:01:56,198
Phil!

00:01:58,534 --> 00:02:00,536
(gasps)

00:02:00,536 --> 00:02:02,438
(crickets chirping)

00:02:40,242 --> 00:02:43,045
(no audio)

00:02:43,045 --> 00:02:45,047
(phone ringing)

00:02:50,655 --> 00:02:51,661
Langston.

00:02:51,661 --> 00:02:53,022
WILLOWS (over phone):
Ray.

00:02:53,022 --> 00:02:55,357
Cops found a body. John Doe.

00:02:55,357 --> 00:02:57,192
Haskell?

00:02:57,192 --> 00:02:59,061
Looks like his work.
They're holding the crime scene.

00:02:59,061 --> 00:03:00,296
Where?

00:03:00,296 --> 00:03:01,463
L.A.

00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,654

WILLOWS:
Detective Sosa?

00:03:59,321 --> 00:04:00,657
Who's asking?

00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,525
Catherine Willows with
the Las Vegas Crime Lab.

00:04:03,525 --> 00:04:05,657
This is Ray Langston.

00:04:05,657 --> 00:04:07,129
Thank you for calling us.

00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:09,531
I didn't call you--
S.I.D. did.

00:04:09,531 --> 00:04:11,567
Ask me, you people
just wasted a trip.

00:04:11,567 --> 00:04:13,168
(siren wailing nearby)

00:04:13,168 --> 00:04:15,104
SOSA:
Hey, Brody!

00:04:16,661 --> 00:04:18,240
Vegas is here.

00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,660
Willows. Langston.
Enjoy.

00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,655
Welcome to L.A.

00:04:23,655 --> 00:04:26,315
Another hour and I'd had
to get some bread.

00:04:26,315 --> 00:04:28,050
Do you always eat
at your crime scenes?

00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,485
Always keep
some in my kit.

00:04:29,485 --> 00:04:31,320
Especially if I know
I'm going to be sharing.

00:04:32,659 --> 00:04:34,523
They do like peanut butter.

00:04:34,523 --> 00:04:36,659
And they really loved him.

00:04:38,657 --> 00:04:41,363
Sorry, buddy,
you're evidence.

00:04:41,363 --> 00:04:44,266
Excuse me.

00:04:46,068 --> 00:04:47,655
LANGSTON:
Significant animal predation.

00:04:47,655 --> 00:04:48,662
BRODY:
Little guy was hungry.

00:04:48,662 --> 00:04:50,339
T.O.D.?

00:04:50,339 --> 00:04:51,659
48 to 72 hours ago.

00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:53,308
Here.

00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:59,048
Looks like
12 sharp-force injuries.

00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:00,516
All postmortem.

00:05:00,516 --> 00:05:02,384
BRODY: We got word to be on
the lookout for Nate Haskell.

00:05:02,384 --> 00:05:03,662
That's why I called you guys.

00:05:03,662 --> 00:05:05,154
I went over Sosa's head.

00:05:05,154 --> 00:05:07,389
Please tell me
I'm not going to lose mine.

00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:08,524
Well, the last DJK murder victim

00:05:08,524 --> 00:05:10,426
had ten postmortem stab wounds.

00:05:10,426 --> 00:05:12,594
If it's Haskell,
he skipped ahead.

00:05:12,594 --> 00:05:14,463
Nah, Haskell considers me
to be his 11th victim,

00:05:14,463 --> 00:05:16,965
even though he didn't
get to stick me 11 times.

00:05:16,965 --> 00:05:20,402
Well, thanks for holding
the crime scene, Brody.

00:05:20,402 --> 00:05:21,660
We're going to need to turn him.

00:05:27,409 --> 00:05:29,545
Excuse me, you Ray?
Yes. And you are?

00:05:29,545 --> 00:05:31,046
I'm the guy who's going
to marry your wife.

00:05:31,046 --> 00:05:32,214
(Gloria laughs)

00:05:44,426 --> 00:05:46,659
All clear.

00:05:50,332 --> 00:05:52,334
(indistinct radio transmission)

00:05:53,569 --> 00:05:56,662
I'll call in S.I.D.

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,009
Ray, I-I don't think
that you should be here.

00:06:13,288 --> 00:06:15,290
Let's see, uh...

00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:16,659
I can have a car
take you downtown.

00:06:16,659 --> 00:06:18,160
Hello! That's evidence!

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,657
WILLOWS:
Ray, what are you doing?

00:06:41,617 --> 00:06:44,119
SANDERS: Condo security company
gave us access

00:06:44,119 --> 00:06:45,654
to the surveillance files.

00:06:45,654 --> 00:06:48,223
The time stamp here is 8:37.

00:06:48,223 --> 00:06:50,359
Metadata says it's from

00:06:50,359 --> 00:06:51,560
three nights ago.

00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,655
I got Gloria and Phil
coming home,

00:06:54,655 --> 00:06:57,660
but somebody else leaving...
in<i>theircar.</i>

00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:00,369
WILLOWS: Well, there's no sign
of Gloria and Phil.

00:07:00,369 --> 00:07:03,138
My vote's
for the trunk.

00:07:03,138 --> 00:07:05,240
Greg, can you get us
a better look?

00:07:09,344 --> 00:07:10,663
Whoa.

00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:12,660
WILLOWS:
Tina Vincent.

00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,517
Who?
Latest bride of Haskell.

00:07:15,517 --> 00:07:17,486
WILLOWS:
Is there a passenger?

00:07:17,486 --> 00:07:19,288
This angle's not helping us.

00:07:19,288 --> 00:07:20,659
Maybe this will.

00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,160
See if I can lose the fun house.

00:07:27,996 --> 00:07:30,599
It's him. It's Haskell.

00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:33,168
I thought you said
he changed his face?

00:07:33,168 --> 00:07:34,536
We were wrong.

00:07:34,536 --> 00:07:37,406
Guess I was wrong about
that wasted trip, huh?

00:07:37,406 --> 00:07:40,175
WILLOWS: Greg, LAPD has given us
their full cooperation.

00:07:40,175 --> 00:07:41,661
Get traffic cam footage
from three nights ago.

00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:43,178
See if you can follow the car.

00:07:43,178 --> 00:07:44,657
Copy that.

00:07:44,657 --> 00:07:46,615
You have
my cooperation.

00:07:46,615 --> 00:07:49,084
Don't forget,
it's still my city.

00:07:49,084 --> 00:07:51,086
(helicopter blades whirring
nearby)

00:07:56,491 --> 00:07:58,661
He gained their trust,
Catherine. He was here.

00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:02,657
We'll find him, Ray.

00:08:02,657 --> 00:08:04,657
And we'll
find Gloria.

00:08:04,657 --> 00:08:07,661
"Three days and three nights
of Heaven on Earth.

00:08:07,661 --> 00:08:10,405
"And then...

00:08:10,405 --> 00:08:11,607
just Heaven."

00:08:11,607 --> 00:08:14,655
Haskell's words.

00:08:14,655 --> 00:08:16,044
It's what he does
with his victims.

00:08:16,044 --> 00:08:18,661
It's already been 72 hours.

00:08:18,661 --> 00:08:20,515
That means she's already gone.

00:08:20,515 --> 00:08:23,018
We'll see what
the evidence says.

00:08:24,386 --> 00:08:27,256
I don't think
I can do this, boss.

00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:29,458
I'll call Sara.

00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,663
I'll have a car take you
back to the airport.

00:08:31,663 --> 00:08:34,096
Thanks.

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,177
LANGSTON:
<i>Let's talk about something</i>
<i>you enjoyed-- your first kill.</i>

00:08:49,177 --> 00:08:51,013
You never forget your first,

00:08:51,013 --> 00:08:53,181
but I think
that's a little intimate

00:08:53,181 --> 00:08:54,655
for this stage
of our relationship.

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,023
LANGSTON:
<i>Tell us your definition of fun.</i>

00:09:01,023 --> 00:09:04,192
Fun is taking something away
from somebody.

00:09:05,527 --> 00:09:08,997
HASKELL:
<i>Oh, Ray...</i>

00:09:08,997 --> 00:09:10,662
there is a moral
to this story.

00:09:10,662 --> 00:09:13,235
Officer, would you mind
pulling up over here?

00:09:13,235 --> 00:09:15,170
Sir?
There's a bar over here.

00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:17,506
I want to have a drink
before I get on the plane.

00:09:17,506 --> 00:09:18,663
Flight's in a half-hour.

00:09:18,663 --> 00:09:20,208
There's a flight
to Vegas every hour.

00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:21,376
I'll take the next one.

00:09:22,611 --> 00:09:24,379
Look, you're welcome
to join me.

00:09:24,379 --> 00:09:28,050
I'm on duty... sir.
(sighs)

00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,662
I'll wait for you out front.

00:09:42,264 --> 00:09:44,266
(phone line ringing)

00:09:45,663 --> 00:09:47,169
(phone beeps)

00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:49,660
LANGSTON:
<i>Hey, it's Ray.</i>

00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:52,107
<i>I know you're working.</i>

00:09:52,107 --> 00:09:55,177
<i>I didn't expect you to answer,</i>
<i>but, uh...</i>

00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:58,513
<i>you're the only one</i>
<i>I can talk to.</i>

00:09:58,513 --> 00:10:03,656
<i>The only person who I think</i>
<i>will truly understand this.</i>

00:10:03,656 --> 00:10:06,154
<i>At least,</i>
<i>I hope you'll understand</i>

00:10:06,154 --> 00:10:08,990
<i>when I've done</i>
<i>what I have to do.</i>

00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:12,663
<i>You know,</i>
<i>we all make choices...</i>

00:10:12,663 --> 00:10:14,662
<i>live with the consequences.</i>

00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,660
<i>The only person</i>
<i>I have ever loved...</i>

00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,655
(door opens)
<i>is dead.</i>

00:10:24,663 --> 00:10:26,657
(continues over recording):
And now...

00:10:26,657 --> 00:10:29,444
there's only one thing left
for me to do.

00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,461
Good-bye, Al.

00:10:39,488 --> 00:10:42,124
There's residue
on the glass.

00:10:42,124 --> 00:10:43,663
They were drugged.

00:10:43,663 --> 00:10:45,360
If Haskell's up
to his old tricks,

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,662
it's probably
<i>Salvia divinorum.</i>

00:10:46,662 --> 00:10:49,531
I'll have the L.A. lab run it.

00:10:49,531 --> 00:10:52,467
Did you meet S.I.D. Brody?
Yeah.

00:10:52,467 --> 00:10:54,657
She seems familiar.

00:10:54,657 --> 00:10:56,656
So, I found blood in the shower.

00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:57,973
Looks like Haskell cleaned up.

00:10:57,973 --> 00:11:00,409
I have yet to
process his gift.

00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:03,656
I'll give
S.I.D. a hand.
Okay.

00:11:03,656 --> 00:11:05,656
(distant siren wailing)

00:11:11,553 --> 00:11:13,659
BRODY: Does this look
like high-velocity
blood spatter to you?

00:11:13,659 --> 00:11:15,123
SIDLE:
Yes, it does.

00:11:15,123 --> 00:11:17,292
Coroner's report said
Phil Baker was strangled

00:11:17,292 --> 00:11:20,562
with a ligature--
probably his own tie.

00:11:20,562 --> 00:11:22,654
Blunt-force trauma
to the head,

00:11:22,654 --> 00:11:25,467
12 postmortem stab wounds--
I don't see all that

00:11:25,467 --> 00:11:27,657
causing this.
SIDLE:
Gunshots maybe?

00:11:27,657 --> 00:11:30,305
Tina Vincent popped
two people in Vegas.

00:11:30,305 --> 00:11:33,041
I'm hoping that we don't have
to add Gloria to the list.

00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:36,077
(insect buzzing)
You hear that?

00:11:36,077 --> 00:11:37,245
What?

00:11:37,245 --> 00:11:38,580
(buzzing continues)

00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:46,154
<i>Megaselia scalaris.</i>

00:11:46,154 --> 00:11:49,424
Little buggers corrupted
our crime scene.

00:11:49,424 --> 00:11:51,656
(insects buzzing)

00:11:53,395 --> 00:11:55,063
BRODY:
<i>No gunshot.</i>

00:11:55,063 --> 00:11:57,065
They painted the wall.
So...

00:11:57,065 --> 00:11:59,034
Haskell's M.O.: kill the man,

00:11:59,034 --> 00:12:01,570
dump the body,
take the woman alive.

00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:04,005
Hmm.

00:12:11,179 --> 00:12:14,015
Oh... blood and tissue.

00:12:15,654 --> 00:12:17,654
Postmortem stab wounds, anyone?

00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:20,659
The flies weren't
the only artists in this room.

00:12:20,659 --> 00:12:22,661
<i>Phil Baker was</i>
<i>struck in the head,</i>

00:12:22,661 --> 00:12:24,259
then strangled.

00:12:24,259 --> 00:12:25,661
Stabbed postmortem.

00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:27,660
The blood
was the paint,

00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,655
the body the brush.

00:12:30,655 --> 00:12:33,001
Dragged him around,
created a Picasso.

00:12:33,001 --> 00:12:35,971
You're thinking that all this
blood came from just one source.

00:12:37,372 --> 00:12:39,107
Haskell wanted Langston
to feel the horror

00:12:39,107 --> 00:12:40,654
of what happened in this room.

00:12:40,654 --> 00:12:42,660
He wanted to get
inside his head.

00:12:44,654 --> 00:12:46,281
Hey.

00:12:46,281 --> 00:12:47,663
Your boy Sanders

00:12:47,663 --> 00:12:49,659
helped us track down
the Bakers' car.

00:12:49,659 --> 00:12:52,354
Dumped in K-Town,
blood in the trunk.

00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:53,522
But no Gloria?

00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:55,257
Way ahead of you.

00:12:55,257 --> 00:12:56,258
I got guys searching

00:12:56,258 --> 00:12:58,026
the park and all
around the observatory.

00:12:58,026 --> 00:13:00,495
But you may need a
search party yourself.

00:13:00,495 --> 00:13:03,265
Ray Langston ditched his
escort to the airport.

00:13:03,265 --> 00:13:05,567
And this morning's little
"bull in a china shop" act

00:13:05,567 --> 00:13:06,662
says he's dangerous.

00:13:08,403 --> 00:13:10,505
Tell me he's not armed.

00:13:16,444 --> 00:13:19,548
I don't want
any serial numbers.
Hey, I run

00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:20,658
a respectable joint here.

00:13:20,658 --> 00:13:23,218
Is that respectable
enough for you?

00:13:26,663 --> 00:13:28,390
I also need a laptop.

00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,392
Gates or Jobs?

00:13:31,661 --> 00:13:34,661
Let me take a look in the back.

00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:57,319
I'm throwing in
a holster for free.

00:14:01,356 --> 00:14:03,091
PAWNBROKER:
That do it for you?

00:14:03,091 --> 00:14:05,060
How much for the laptop?

00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,662
Five more bills.

00:14:08,496 --> 00:14:10,656
(long sigh)

00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:13,568
Sold.

00:14:13,568 --> 00:14:14,970
No negotiating?

00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:16,338
Well, I like that.

00:14:16,338 --> 00:14:18,506
Hey, Willoughby Observatory--
it's the best view

00:14:18,506 --> 00:14:20,657
in town.

00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,312
Nicky, I need you in L.A.

00:14:24,312 --> 00:14:26,548
I can't find Ray.
He's not answering his phone.

00:14:26,548 --> 00:14:27,659
Yeah, I know.
I'm worried.

00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:30,018
He called the doc.
He didn't sound real good.

00:14:30,018 --> 00:14:31,987
It sounds like
he's in a dark place.

00:14:31,987 --> 00:14:33,321
Well, he's here somewhere.

00:14:33,321 --> 00:14:34,654
We got to find him.

00:14:34,654 --> 00:14:37,559
All right. I'm on my way.
I'll find his ass.

00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:40,659
We opened up Gloria's
social network page.

00:14:40,659 --> 00:14:42,657
Found she'd been tagged
in a friend's photo.

00:14:42,657 --> 00:14:43,660
SIDLE:
We now know where

00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,500
Gloria and Phil met
Haskell and Tina.

00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,502
It was a benefit concert
four nights ago.

00:14:47,502 --> 00:14:49,654
Gloria was the main attraction.

00:14:49,654 --> 00:14:52,073
Gloria and Phil invited
Haskell and Tina for drinks

00:14:52,073 --> 00:14:53,274
the next night.

00:14:53,274 --> 00:14:55,110
"Willoughby J. Willoughby."

00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:57,078
Is that supposed to be
some kind of joke?

00:14:57,078 --> 00:14:58,279
Another of Haskell's
riddles, maybe?

00:14:58,279 --> 00:14:59,657
Well, the postcard
that was left

00:14:59,657 --> 00:15:01,659
at the crime scene
had a picture

00:15:01,659 --> 00:15:05,186
of Willoughby Canyon
and Observatory on it.

00:15:05,186 --> 00:15:07,288
So what's he
trying to say?
I don't know.

00:15:07,288 --> 00:15:09,391
Maybe it has something to do
with this guy Willoughby

00:15:09,391 --> 00:15:11,660
or some kind of
L.A. lore or history.

00:15:14,329 --> 00:15:15,660
Oh, don't look at me.

00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,166
I... always did
better in science.

00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:19,662
SIDLE:
You know,

00:15:19,662 --> 00:15:22,437
we do know somebody
who's into both.

00:15:26,574 --> 00:15:30,011
Willoughby J. Willoughby
was a wealthy L.A. benefactor

00:15:30,011 --> 00:15:31,659
who made his fortune
in shipping.

00:15:31,659 --> 00:15:33,515
But the bulk of his profits

00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:35,550
were thought to have come
from money-laundering.

00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:36,655
Explains the
benefactor part.

00:15:36,655 --> 00:15:38,153
Trying to clean
up his act.

00:15:38,153 --> 00:15:39,654
Yeah, well, it didn't last.

00:15:39,654 --> 00:15:43,324
'Cause in 1943, he shot his wife
in the head during an argument.

00:15:43,324 --> 00:15:45,527
Attack on his wife.

00:15:47,128 --> 00:15:49,998
I think I'm starting
to get the joke.

00:15:49,998 --> 00:15:52,657
The postcard, the ring,

00:15:52,657 --> 00:15:54,069
"Gloria in
Excelsis Deo."

00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:56,337
Haskell wanted Ray
to come out and play.

00:15:56,337 --> 00:15:59,040
So... some kind
of an invitation.

00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,241
WILLOWS:
Except we're the ones

00:16:00,241 --> 00:16:02,377
who are gonna
crash the party.

00:16:02,377 --> 00:16:04,657
Greg, I want to know
everything there is to know

00:16:04,657 --> 00:16:06,581
about Willoughby J. Willoughby.

00:16:06,581 --> 00:16:08,183
Work your magic.

00:16:08,183 --> 00:16:10,251
Do my best.

00:17:43,411 --> 00:17:46,414
I drove straight
from the airport to
S.I.D., checked in.

00:17:46,414 --> 00:17:47,654
Sara told me you'd be here.

00:17:47,654 --> 00:17:50,385
Detective Sosa, this
is CSI Nick Stokes.

00:17:50,385 --> 00:17:51,352
Hey, man.

00:17:51,352 --> 00:17:54,189
Wow. Anybody left in
Vegas to catch crooks?

00:17:54,189 --> 00:17:56,024
Yeah, there's still
a couple of us.

00:17:56,024 --> 00:17:57,659
So, what's going on here?

00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:59,655
Got a call. Shots fired.

00:17:59,655 --> 00:18:02,197
Units responded,
found a Caucasian female.

00:18:03,231 --> 00:18:05,033
Who is she?

00:18:05,033 --> 00:18:07,435
WILLOWS (sighs):
Tina Vincent.

00:18:07,435 --> 00:18:10,572
Somebody worked her over pretty
good.

00:18:10,572 --> 00:18:12,574
Looks like she
might've gotten

00:18:12,574 --> 00:18:14,409
a couple of licks in, though.

00:18:16,657 --> 00:18:18,580
Nine-mil.

00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:21,657
One in the leg,

00:18:21,657 --> 00:18:22,658
one in the head,

00:18:22,658 --> 00:18:25,661
and a whole lot
of ugly in between.

00:18:25,661 --> 00:18:28,658
I used to work Narco--
whoever did this
wanted information.

00:18:28,658 --> 00:18:31,159
Or he was just
a sadistic bastard.

00:18:42,537 --> 00:18:46,374
SOSA:
Excuse me, what do you two
think you're doing?

00:18:47,442 --> 00:18:48,610
Gonna process the scene.

00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:49,662
Look, I'm all
about cooperating,

00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:51,412
but I'd prefer to have

00:18:51,412 --> 00:18:52,614
my people handle this.

WILLOWS:
Look, Detective Sosa,

00:18:58,019 --> 00:18:59,663
this is still a DJK case.

Forgot something.

00:19:26,547 --> 00:19:27,655
Thanks.

00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:30,251
Morgan.

00:19:31,286 --> 00:19:33,221
I just figured it out--

00:19:33,221 --> 00:19:34,656
you're Conrad's daughter.

00:19:34,656 --> 00:19:37,191
Before the divorce.
(laughs)

00:19:37,191 --> 00:19:39,655
Last time I saw you,
you were just a kid.

00:19:39,655 --> 00:19:41,329
So you don't
go by Ecklie.

00:19:41,329 --> 00:19:42,662
I took my stepdad's last name.

00:19:43,965 --> 00:19:46,000
I'll catch you guys later.

00:19:48,603 --> 00:19:50,605

three people there--

00:19:57,545 --> 00:19:59,447
Nate Haskell,

00:19:59,447 --> 00:20:01,049
Tina Vincent...

00:20:01,049 --> 00:20:04,185
SOSA:
And CSI Raymond Langston.

00:20:05,486 --> 00:20:07,355
You want to explain that to me?

00:20:07,355 --> 00:20:09,524
I can't.
I got enough trouble

00:20:09,524 --> 00:20:11,259
chasing down the bad guys;
I don't need

00:20:11,259 --> 00:20:13,656
to be chasing
the good ones, too.
Look, we don't know

00:20:13,656 --> 00:20:14,963
what happened in that room.

00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:17,031
Yeah, we do.
Someone tortured that girl

00:20:17,031 --> 00:20:20,168
till they got what they
wanted, then they put
a bullet through her head.

00:20:20,168 --> 00:20:21,302
Now, I'm gonna ask you again:

00:20:21,302 --> 00:20:23,658
does Ray
Langston carry?
No.

00:20:26,607 --> 00:20:29,010
What about blood evidence?

00:20:30,311 --> 00:20:32,146
I found blood

00:20:32,146 --> 00:20:34,660
on the doorknob
and on the vic's ring,

00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:37,285
along with epithelials
under her fingernails.

00:20:37,285 --> 00:20:39,120
Consistent
with a struggle.

00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,356
DNA comes back to an unknown
African-American male.

00:20:41,356 --> 00:20:43,659
You run it against
CSI Langston?
I would have,

00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:46,260
but... he wasn't in the system.

00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,496
How is that possible?
Man's a CSI.

00:20:48,496 --> 00:20:50,655
Submission is voluntary.
Great.

00:20:50,655 --> 00:20:53,301
So if I ever want
to kill someone, I'll
just transfer to Vegas.

00:20:53,301 --> 00:20:56,170
Ray's not a murderer.
No?

00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:58,659
He's definitely a suspect.

00:21:02,657 --> 00:21:04,078
(sighs)

00:21:08,983 --> 00:21:10,618
(exhales)

00:21:18,493 --> 00:21:20,328
How did you find me?

00:21:20,328 --> 00:21:21,963
I'm part hound dog.

00:21:21,963 --> 00:21:24,432
I pinged your cell,
traced it back

00:21:24,432 --> 00:21:26,534
to a tower near
Dodger Stadium,

00:21:26,534 --> 00:21:29,170
then checked out
all the motels one
cut above fleabag.

00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:31,654
It was really
pretty easy.

00:21:31,654 --> 00:21:33,508
When did you start
carrying a gun again?

00:21:33,508 --> 00:21:34,662
You need to go home, Nick.

00:21:34,662 --> 00:21:36,657
You're not taking me back.
I'm not here

00:21:36,657 --> 00:21:39,213
to take you back;
I'm here to help you out.

00:21:39,213 --> 00:21:41,382
Haskell wants<i>me.</i>

00:21:41,382 --> 00:21:44,052
All right?
He doesn't want you.

00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:45,660
Raymond...

00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:48,654
Tina Vincent's dead.

00:21:52,393 --> 00:21:54,529
Now, I know
you didn't kill her...

00:21:54,529 --> 00:21:56,661
but you need to tell me
what happened.

00:21:57,662 --> 00:22:00,654
Haskell wanted me to find her.

00:22:02,336 --> 00:22:03,471
(grunts, laughs)

00:22:03,471 --> 00:22:04,605
Where is he, Tina?

00:22:04,605 --> 00:22:06,661
You want to hurt me?

00:22:06,661 --> 00:22:10,044
You're going to tell me
what I want to know.

00:22:10,044 --> 00:22:11,245
(Tina laughing)

00:22:11,245 --> 00:22:14,082
And did she?

00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:16,663
All she would said is that Nate

00:22:16,663 --> 00:22:18,419
wanted me to have that.

00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:21,456
Said the blood on
it was Gloria's.

00:22:21,456 --> 00:22:24,092
It used every ounce of my
strength not to hurt her.

00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:25,526
Well, Haskell came back
after you left

00:22:25,526 --> 00:22:26,662
and he put a real good hurting
on her

00:22:26,662 --> 00:22:29,197
for you.

00:22:29,197 --> 00:22:30,659
You do realize

00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:32,233
what he's doing, don't you?

00:22:32,233 --> 00:22:33,468
Yes, yes, he's isolating me.

00:22:33,468 --> 00:22:34,661
He's making you
a fugitive.

00:22:34,661 --> 00:22:37,572
He's cutting you off
from everyone and everything.

00:22:37,572 --> 00:22:40,074
And believe me, if it was
this easy for me to find you,

00:22:40,074 --> 00:22:42,076
LAPD won't have a problem.

00:22:42,076 --> 00:22:44,659
Take a look at this.

00:22:46,314 --> 00:22:49,150
I found this
at Tina Vincent's crime scene.

00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:50,485
"You never forget your first."

00:22:50,485 --> 00:22:51,619
Same ticket, same message.

00:22:51,619 --> 00:22:53,955
What is he saying?

00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:56,124
This sick bastard is leaving us
a bread crumb trail.

00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:57,959
All we have to do is figure out
where it leads.

00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:00,654
I can't exactly
call the lab now, can I?

00:23:00,654 --> 00:23:02,654
I can.

00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:09,661
STOKES (over phone):
How we doing, Greg?

00:23:09,661 --> 00:23:11,339
(hushed):
Ask him about Langston.

00:23:11,339 --> 00:23:12,655
I found the manufacturer
of the tickets.

00:23:12,655 --> 00:23:15,009
(hushed):
Ask him about Langston.

00:23:15,009 --> 00:23:16,660
Running the numbers through the
company's database right now.

00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,146
Will you ask him?
Shut up.

00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:19,313
STOKES:
What?

00:23:19,313 --> 00:23:20,658
Um, sorry.
I wasn't talking to you.

00:23:20,658 --> 00:23:22,661
Uh, Nick, yeah, it's me.

00:23:22,661 --> 00:23:26,658
Um, I heard the news, and, uh,
while I can empathize with Ray,

00:23:26,658 --> 00:23:28,660
I feel I must express my concern

00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:31,192
that his Dirty Harry style
antics

00:23:31,192 --> 00:23:33,655
of late can only reflect badly
on the team.

00:23:33,655 --> 00:23:34,662
Hodges, put Greg
back on the phone.

00:23:34,662 --> 00:23:36,397
Yeah, will do.

00:23:36,397 --> 00:23:39,659
Just tell me,
is there any news from Ray?

00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:41,654
But when I find him, you'll
be the first to know.

00:23:41,654 --> 00:23:43,237
Give me that.

00:23:43,237 --> 00:23:44,572
All right,
I think I got something.

00:23:44,572 --> 00:23:46,374
According to this,
the tickets were delivered

00:23:46,374 --> 00:23:48,109
to L.A.

00:23:48,109 --> 00:23:51,112
Part of a shipment
to the Santa Monica Pier.

00:23:52,146 --> 00:23:54,482
(music playing in distance)

00:24:00,454 --> 00:24:03,124
The carousel.

00:24:03,124 --> 00:24:05,259
"You never forget your first."

00:24:05,259 --> 00:24:07,028
What are you talking about?

00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:09,430
My first date with Gloria
was on a carousel in Baltimore.

00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:10,661
How would Haskell
know something like that?

00:24:13,234 --> 00:24:15,661
We may be walking
into something here.

00:24:16,662 --> 00:24:18,072
You got my back, right?

00:24:18,072 --> 00:24:19,574
Always.

00:24:26,658 --> 00:24:28,658
(door closes)

00:24:43,197 --> 00:24:44,662
(carousel music begins playing)

00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:08,589
This isn't our first date, Ray.

00:25:10,358 --> 00:25:12,659
It's just our first
without a chaperone.

00:25:17,598 --> 00:25:18,660
STOKES:
Get your hands up.

00:25:20,663 --> 00:25:23,004
Ahh... Ray!

00:25:23,004 --> 00:25:25,039
No fair.

00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:27,608
You're under arrest,
you son of a bitch.

00:25:27,608 --> 00:25:29,655
Yeah.
(two gunshots)

00:25:31,178 --> 00:25:32,655
STOKES:
Where is he?

00:25:34,315 --> 00:25:36,317
STOKES:
I got the other side.

00:25:36,317 --> 00:25:38,085
(door opens)
Outside, Ray.

00:25:39,657 --> 00:25:41,657
(chain rattles)

00:25:42,556 --> 00:25:44,558
(rattles)

00:25:57,204 --> 00:25:59,655
(passengers screaming happily)

00:26:02,663 --> 00:26:04,663
(bell ringing)

00:26:06,113 --> 00:26:08,082
(people chatting, laughing)

00:26:10,251 --> 00:26:12,253
(bell ringing)

00:26:14,588 --> 00:26:16,590
(people chatting, laughing)

00:26:24,655 --> 00:26:27,168
Haskell, hold it right there.

00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:27,968
Drop the gun!

00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:30,004
I'm a CSI, in pursuit
of a suspect.

00:26:30,004 --> 00:26:32,658
Look, I don't care who the hell
you are-- drop the gun!

00:26:32,658 --> 00:26:34,241
You're making a big mistake.
Listen to me!

00:26:34,241 --> 00:26:35,242
No, you listen!

00:26:35,242 --> 00:26:36,657
Drop the gun, get on your knees

00:26:36,657 --> 00:26:38,346
and put your hands
behind your head!

00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:42,216
Do it, now!

00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:46,655
I'm not getting on my knees.

00:26:50,658 --> 00:26:52,493
(handcuffs clicking)

00:26:52,493 --> 00:26:55,463
(man speaks indistinctly
over speaker)

00:26:57,565 --> 00:27:00,301
(woman laughing, bell ringing)

00:27:07,661 --> 00:27:10,010
(people chatting, laughing)

00:27:16,317 --> 00:27:17,985
Don't move!
Drop the gun!

00:27:17,985 --> 00:27:19,656
Listen to him, Ray.

00:27:19,656 --> 00:27:21,021
(gunshot)

00:27:22,657 --> 00:27:23,663
It can't end like this, Ray.

00:27:23,663 --> 00:27:26,060
Oh, I know
how you feel, Ray,

00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:28,657
but if you pull that trigger
now, you'll kill more than me.

00:27:28,657 --> 00:27:30,661
Two people die, Ray!

00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,657
She's still alive!

00:27:34,657 --> 00:27:36,659
Gloria's still alive, Ray!

00:27:36,659 --> 00:27:39,373
OFFICER:
Drop the gun, now!

00:27:40,975 --> 00:27:42,654
(gun clatters)

00:27:42,654 --> 00:27:44,654
(passengers screaming happily)

00:27:52,417 --> 00:27:56,257
SOSA:
Nate Haskell is responsible for
the deaths of over 25 people,

00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:59,360
including four law enforcement
officers in Las Vegas.

00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,464
And last night he damn near
took the life of one of my men.

00:28:03,464 --> 00:28:05,661
So how come
he didn't take yours?

00:28:05,661 --> 00:28:08,102
I can't answer that.

00:28:09,136 --> 00:28:10,662
That's a load of crap.

00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,542
Where'd you get the gun?

00:28:14,542 --> 00:28:15,658
I took it from an assailant

00:28:15,658 --> 00:28:17,178
who attempted to mug me
in MacArthur Park.

00:28:17,178 --> 00:28:19,180
My intention was to turn it in.

00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:22,349
You know something...

00:28:22,349 --> 00:28:25,286
you're lucky Officer Davies
was wearing a vest...

00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:27,658
and that the slug
we took out of it

00:28:27,658 --> 00:28:30,654
was a match to the bullet
that killed Tina Vincent.

00:28:30,654 --> 00:28:33,461
But you knew
where to find her.

00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:35,396
And you knew
where to find Haskell.

00:28:38,365 --> 00:28:40,568
Now, I don't care
if you're inside his head,

00:28:40,568 --> 00:28:43,270
or he's inside yours.

00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:44,972
You know what's going on here.

00:28:46,974 --> 00:28:48,375
You got a choice.

00:28:48,375 --> 00:28:50,654
You talk to me, or I'm putting
your ass on a plane

00:28:50,654 --> 00:28:52,246
back to Vegas myself.

00:28:56,659 --> 00:28:59,620
Am I being charged with a crime?

00:29:20,655 --> 00:29:22,376
I'll be the one
to get him on the plane.

00:29:22,376 --> 00:29:24,578
You know, if it was up to me,
I'd send you all home.

00:29:24,578 --> 00:29:26,657
But then, I got
a problem--

00:29:26,657 --> 00:29:29,083
Haskell drops another body
and it's my ass in the sling

00:29:29,083 --> 00:29:30,384
'cause I'm the moron

00:29:30,384 --> 00:29:32,656
who sent the Haskell experts
back to Vegas.

00:29:32,656 --> 00:29:34,657
So no free airfare then?

00:29:34,657 --> 00:29:38,225
How about no more surprises?

00:29:51,171 --> 00:29:53,173
I'll meet you back
at S.I.D.

00:29:53,173 --> 00:29:55,576
I'll go check in with Morgan.

00:29:58,045 --> 00:29:59,513
I told you to find him, Nicky.

00:29:59,513 --> 00:30:01,448
I did find him.
I should've known.

00:30:01,448 --> 00:30:02,662
You had to have his back,

00:30:02,662 --> 00:30:04,661
had to cowboy up
on some vigilante mission.

00:30:04,661 --> 00:30:08,222
I mean, I get him,
but you have no excuse.

00:30:08,222 --> 00:30:10,224
So are you sending
me home, now, too?

00:30:10,224 --> 00:30:12,159
Oh, I'd like to, but I can't,
because I need you here.

00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:14,656
And, luckily, LAPD is giving you
a second chance.

00:30:14,656 --> 00:30:15,661
Ray...

00:30:15,661 --> 00:30:18,332
you're going back
to Vegas.

00:30:18,332 --> 00:30:20,067
Do I have to post a guard
at your door?

00:30:20,067 --> 00:30:23,571
No, that won't be necessary.

00:30:30,663 --> 00:30:32,580
We'll get him.

00:30:35,449 --> 00:30:37,656
SIDLE:
Smooth, polished surface.

00:30:37,656 --> 00:30:38,662
It looks like beach sand.

00:30:38,662 --> 00:30:40,659
Recovered
from Tina Vincent's room.

00:30:40,659 --> 00:30:42,556
Well, that makes sense--
Haskell was at the pier,

00:30:42,556 --> 00:30:43,991
he spent some time at the beach.

00:30:43,991 --> 00:30:45,655
Found more
than just beach sand.

00:30:45,655 --> 00:30:47,528
I think he's been spending time
somewhere else.

00:30:47,528 --> 00:30:49,660
Put your nose down that one.

00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:53,659
Nesosilicates, garnet.

00:30:53,659 --> 00:30:55,502
There's chips of paint
in the mix.

00:30:55,502 --> 00:30:58,205
This sand is from construction.

00:30:58,205 --> 00:30:59,660
Sandblasting, maybe.

00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:02,009
Plenty of that downtown,

00:31:02,009 --> 00:31:03,655
at least until the economy
hit the skids.

00:31:03,655 --> 00:31:05,661
Maybe Haskell's squatting.

00:31:05,661 --> 00:31:08,657
Or it's where
he left Gloria's body.

00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:14,288
The rings of a tree
will give up its history.

00:31:16,661 --> 00:31:18,661
Blast the paint off
the side of a building,

00:31:18,661 --> 00:31:20,461
layers are going to tell you
the same story.

00:31:22,129 --> 00:31:24,298
Time for a little chip and dip.

00:31:51,658 --> 00:31:53,293
(beeps)

00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:06,662
(sighs)

00:32:07,663 --> 00:32:09,543
ROBBINS:
Hey, Ray.

00:32:09,543 --> 00:32:11,545
Hey.

00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:15,115
Thanks for coming
to get me.

00:32:15,115 --> 00:32:16,658
Well, Catherine didn't
give me much choice.

00:32:16,658 --> 00:32:18,986
Yeah.
But I would've
been here anyway.

00:32:20,421 --> 00:32:21,658
What's going on?

00:32:22,956 --> 00:32:26,658
Haskell could've killed me,
he didn't.

00:32:26,658 --> 00:32:28,661
Yeah, well, maybe he
didn't want to kill you.

00:32:28,661 --> 00:32:32,299
He just...
wants to keep hurting you.

00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,654
Can we go back to the office
for a while?

00:32:35,654 --> 00:32:36,662
You're on leave, Ray.

00:32:36,662 --> 00:32:38,338
You think that's a good idea?
I don't know.

00:32:38,338 --> 00:32:39,657
You think it's a good idea
for me to just go home

00:32:39,657 --> 00:32:41,657
and sit in an empty house?

00:32:43,077 --> 00:32:45,012
Come on.

00:32:45,012 --> 00:32:46,661
The trace that we thought
was sand in Tina Vincent's room

00:32:46,661 --> 00:32:49,016
turned out to be
commercial sandblasting.

00:32:49,016 --> 00:32:50,284
Found paint chips
in the mix.

00:32:50,284 --> 00:32:51,661
Gave us a profile
of the building.

00:32:51,661 --> 00:32:53,660
You're thinking if we find the
building, we may find Haskell.

00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,661
STOKES:
Base layer
had traces of concrete.

00:32:55,661 --> 00:32:57,458
Suggests it's industrial.

00:32:57,458 --> 00:32:59,326
12 layers?

00:32:59,326 --> 00:33:02,229
Damn. You figure buildings
get a new coat of paint
every six to eight years.

00:33:02,229 --> 00:33:03,657
Place is old.

00:33:03,657 --> 00:33:06,500
But the sandblasting suggests
it's under renovation,

00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,368
at least at some point recently.

00:33:08,368 --> 00:33:09,659
SIDLE:
Chemical composition
of the paint

00:33:09,659 --> 00:33:12,072
indicated epoxy formulations--

00:33:12,072 --> 00:33:13,655
maintenance paint
used in railings, fire doors...

00:33:13,655 --> 00:33:14,661
STOKES:
So, what,

00:33:14,661 --> 00:33:16,658
we're talking
about a school, hospital,

00:33:16,658 --> 00:33:18,045
or government building?

00:33:18,045 --> 00:33:19,655
Narrows it down.

00:33:19,655 --> 00:33:21,048
Let's have LAPD pull

00:33:21,048 --> 00:33:22,049
building
and demolition permits

00:33:22,049 --> 00:33:23,383
over the last three years.

00:33:23,383 --> 00:33:24,658
We'll start there.

00:33:24,658 --> 00:33:27,020
Nice work, Morgan.

00:33:28,388 --> 00:33:30,656
Yeah, thanks.

00:33:41,656 --> 00:33:43,270
Hey.
Hey.

00:33:45,654 --> 00:33:47,107
Access denied.

00:33:47,107 --> 00:33:49,109
Yeah, you're probably
thinking virus,

00:33:49,109 --> 00:33:51,078
but, uh, it's Willows.

00:33:51,078 --> 00:33:53,046
Catherine pulled
my privileges?

00:33:53,046 --> 00:33:54,657
I'm sure
it's just temporary.
You're damn right

00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:55,983
it's only temporary
'cause you're going

00:33:55,983 --> 00:33:57,151
to give me your
passcode right now.

00:33:57,151 --> 00:33:58,663
No, I can't do that.
Or I'm going

00:33:58,663 --> 00:34:00,387
to go all Dirty Harry on you.

00:34:01,388 --> 00:34:03,090
You were listening.

00:34:04,324 --> 00:34:06,126
I'm going to do this one time.

00:34:14,301 --> 00:34:16,436

00:34:16,436 --> 00:34:20,655
Willoughby J. Willoughby.

00:34:20,655 --> 00:34:22,655
LANGSTON:
"Born 1895, died 1963.

00:34:22,655 --> 00:34:23,663
"Shipping magnate,

00:34:23,663 --> 00:34:26,346
"Willoughby donated
thousands of acres of land

00:34:26,346 --> 00:34:29,149
to the city of
Los Angeles."

00:34:29,149 --> 00:34:30,484
What's going on?

00:34:30,484 --> 00:34:33,487
You can be part of the problem
or part of the solution.

00:34:33,487 --> 00:34:35,589
Solution.

00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:38,660
Back to Willoughby J.
Willoughby, huh?

00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,994
Thought we left
him behind

00:34:40,994 --> 00:34:42,963
with Tina Vincent
at The Penwick.
We did.

00:34:42,963 --> 00:34:44,331
Not so sure about Haskell,
though.

00:34:48,135 --> 00:34:50,337
Man shoots his wife
in the head, kills her.

00:34:50,337 --> 00:34:53,440
I mean, there's got to
be... some deeper meaning.

00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,342
He didn't kill her.

00:34:55,342 --> 00:34:58,145
She survived?

00:34:58,145 --> 00:34:59,213
Yes.

00:34:59,213 --> 00:35:00,660
Is that significant?

00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:03,656
Yes. Tell me more
about the crime.

00:35:03,656 --> 00:35:05,452
SANDERS:
LAPD faxed me copies

00:35:05,452 --> 00:35:06,656
of the old case files.

00:35:06,656 --> 00:35:09,654
Apparently, Willoughby
was a bigamist.

00:35:09,654 --> 00:35:11,158
Willoughby J. Willoughby--

00:35:11,158 --> 00:35:13,560
a name so nice,
he married twice.

00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,429
Willoughby's
second wife Audrey

00:35:15,429 --> 00:35:17,197
was from Las Vegas.

00:35:17,197 --> 00:35:18,398
The night of the shooting,

00:35:18,398 --> 00:35:21,034
Wife Number One--
Sylvia-- surprised

00:35:21,034 --> 00:35:24,404
Willoughby and Wife Number Two
during a tryst at The Penwick.

00:35:24,404 --> 00:35:27,574
One thing led to another, and
Willoughby shot Wife Number One.

00:35:27,574 --> 00:35:30,611
So Wife Number Two
witnessed the crime?

00:35:30,611 --> 00:35:32,212
Along with
her seven-year-old son,

00:35:32,212 --> 00:35:34,514
who was staying
in the adjoining room.

00:35:34,514 --> 00:35:36,450
HODGES:
And that seven-year-old boy

00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:37,551
is Nate Haskell.

00:35:38,585 --> 00:35:40,662
If Nate Haskell
were 75 years old.

00:35:40,662 --> 00:35:42,356
What was the boy's name?

00:35:42,356 --> 00:35:44,258
Arvin.

00:35:44,258 --> 00:35:46,661
Wife Number One survives.

00:35:47,995 --> 00:35:50,330
Do we know what happened
to Wife Number Two?

00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:53,033
According to court records,
uh, Audrey Willoughby,

00:35:53,033 --> 00:35:55,235
two years following
the shooting, was committed

00:35:55,235 --> 00:35:59,072
to a psychiatric facility--
St. Collette's Hospital in L.A.

00:35:59,072 --> 00:36:02,209
The boy was placed
into the custody

00:36:02,209 --> 00:36:04,411
of his uncle,
and that's

00:36:04,411 --> 00:36:06,546
pretty much where
the trail ends.
Hmm.

00:36:06,546 --> 00:36:08,048
Wife died the same year
the hospital closed

00:36:08,048 --> 00:36:10,662
in the mid-1980s.

00:36:10,662 --> 00:36:12,986
Is there a problem?

00:36:12,986 --> 00:36:14,656
Catherine said
that Haskell might be hiding out

00:36:14,656 --> 00:36:15,989
in an industrial building,

00:36:15,989 --> 00:36:18,592
maybe a hospital.

00:36:20,663 --> 00:36:23,130
One from around the same era...

00:36:24,231 --> 00:36:27,234
...undergoing renovations.

00:36:30,604 --> 00:36:33,373
I've, uh, got to call Catherine.

00:36:50,655 --> 00:36:52,259
David.
Yeah.

00:36:52,259 --> 00:36:53,460
Would you mind getting us
some coffee?

00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,494
Absolutely.
