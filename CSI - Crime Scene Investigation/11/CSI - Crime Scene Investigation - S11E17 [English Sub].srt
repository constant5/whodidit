00:00:04,955 --> 00:00:06,041
GUARD:
Move, keep moving.

00:00:06,041 --> 00:00:07,570
(cell door clangs)

00:00:08,705 --> 00:00:11,037
(buzzer sounds)

00:00:11,037 --> 00:00:13,409
(indistinct voices)

00:00:25,455 --> 00:00:27,690
All right.
Noses to the wall!

00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,041
All right, let's
step to the wall.

00:00:34,697 --> 00:00:36,043
(smooching)

00:00:36,043 --> 00:00:37,042
What you looking at, Beaner?

00:00:37,042 --> 00:00:39,042
One ugly-ass white bitch.

00:00:39,042 --> 00:00:41,971
(clamoring)

00:00:41,971 --> 00:00:44,036
Get back up against the wall!

00:00:44,036 --> 00:00:47,034
This is Officer Malone on
the North Corridor. Inmate 415.

00:00:47,034 --> 00:00:49,041
Request immediate backup.

00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:50,847
Get down or you're going
in the hole!

00:00:50,847 --> 00:00:52,035
Move, move!

00:00:52,035 --> 00:00:54,551
(alarm blaring,
clamoring continues)

00:01:00,823 --> 00:01:03,626
GUARD:
Hands on the wall!

00:01:03,626 --> 00:01:05,528
You heard me?!

00:01:05,528 --> 00:01:06,529
(alarm stops)

00:01:06,529 --> 00:01:08,036
(buzzer sounds)

00:01:08,036 --> 00:01:10,567
CSIs coming in.

00:01:10,567 --> 00:01:12,535
(buzzer sounds)

00:01:19,038 --> 00:01:20,577
(door clangs)

00:01:21,811 --> 00:01:23,813
I hate that sound.

00:01:23,813 --> 00:01:26,036
WARDEN: You guys might want
to take your jackets

00:01:26,036 --> 00:01:27,350
and turn them inside out.
Half these guys

00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:29,043
are in here
'cause of you.

00:01:29,043 --> 00:01:33,043
Let them take a good,
long look, then.

00:01:33,043 --> 00:01:35,625
I'm good.

00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,762
(buzzer sounds)

00:01:51,341 --> 00:01:55,378
MAN: Yeah, we got 'em in full
lockdown, Clark County.

00:01:57,041 --> 00:01:58,915
(loud clang)

00:01:59,949 --> 00:02:01,851
Jim.
Hey.

00:02:01,851 --> 00:02:03,353
What's the story?
How'd it happen?

00:02:03,353 --> 00:02:05,521
A corrections officer
was walking a bunch

00:02:05,521 --> 00:02:07,036
of the Aryan Brotherhood

00:02:07,036 --> 00:02:10,043
by another bunch
of not very Aryan brothers.

00:02:10,043 --> 00:02:11,894
Never a good idea.

00:02:11,894 --> 00:02:15,036
So, collateral damage? Wrong
place, wrong time, or what?

00:02:15,036 --> 00:02:18,043
Maybe, maybe not.
Guy's a cop.

00:02:18,043 --> 00:02:19,936
Vance Tolsom.

00:02:19,936 --> 00:02:21,904
Brime County Deputy.
He and I worked

00:02:21,904 --> 00:02:23,506
a bunch of cases
back in the day.

00:02:23,506 --> 00:02:25,035
Guy was a son
of a bitch.

00:02:25,035 --> 00:02:28,035
He had a short fuse, and he
didn't take crap from anybody.

00:02:28,035 --> 00:02:29,812
STOKES: Well, he was stabbed
multiple times.

00:02:29,812 --> 00:02:31,037
Somebody really
wanted this guy dead.

00:02:31,037 --> 00:02:33,449
How'd he end up in prison
in the first place?

00:02:33,449 --> 00:02:35,985
He killed
his wife Anne-Marie.

00:02:35,985 --> 00:02:38,388
She was a cop, too.

00:02:38,388 --> 00:02:40,390
When she got out
of the Academy,

00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,035
I was her T.O.

00:02:42,035 --> 00:02:44,627
What was an ex-cop doing
in general population ward?

00:02:44,627 --> 00:02:46,996
In keep-away for
the first six months.

00:02:46,996 --> 00:02:48,531
Bitching about going nuts,

00:02:48,531 --> 00:02:50,037
said he was willing
to take his chances.

00:02:50,037 --> 00:02:52,368
Mixed in pretty well
for the past three years.

00:02:52,368 --> 00:02:53,736
Too bad.

00:02:53,736 --> 00:02:55,471
Vance was going
to get a new trial.

00:02:55,471 --> 00:02:58,041
BRASS: Vance always bragged
how he was bulletproof.

00:02:58,041 --> 00:03:01,744
Well, he wasn't stab proof.
Medical tape on the handle.

00:03:01,744 --> 00:03:03,479
It's going to be difficult
to get prints off that.

00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:05,882
We got shoe impressions
in the blood.

00:03:05,882 --> 00:03:07,617
And the blood on their jumps
should tell us something.

00:03:07,617 --> 00:03:09,385
Mm-hmm.
Listen up!

00:03:09,385 --> 00:03:12,039
I want your sneakers!
I want your jumps!

00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:13,456
I want your DNA!

00:03:13,456 --> 00:03:14,524
I want to see your hands!

00:03:14,524 --> 00:03:16,392
I want to see your eyes!

00:03:16,392 --> 00:03:18,561
This man you killed was a cop!

00:03:18,561 --> 00:03:20,830
So there will be consequences!

00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:22,832
Prison will not protect you!

Okay, open up.

Yeah, I'm pretty sure I'm
already in your database.

00:04:06,576 --> 00:04:08,378
At least twice.

00:04:08,378 --> 00:04:09,879
But it wasn't me.

00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:11,042
That's why I'm going to collect
your DNA

00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,482
and swab that blood
off your hands,

00:04:12,482 --> 00:04:14,035
give you a fair shake
this time. What do you say?

00:04:14,035 --> 00:04:16,042
Yeah, thanks.

00:04:16,042 --> 00:04:17,687
Hey.

00:04:17,687 --> 00:04:19,722
Hey, hey.

00:04:19,722 --> 00:04:20,890
Just leave
your hands alone.

00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:22,558
You'll get a chance
to clean them up

00:04:22,558 --> 00:04:24,527
after I'm done.

00:04:24,527 --> 00:04:27,040
LANGSTON:
Cut 'em off.

00:04:29,038 --> 00:04:30,433
Take off your shirt.

00:04:32,869 --> 00:04:34,871
Don't make me ask you
again. Take it off.

00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:42,712
(clears throat)

00:04:42,712 --> 00:04:44,781
You like what you see?

00:04:44,781 --> 00:04:46,038
Hmm?

00:04:46,038 --> 00:04:47,717
Take off your
pants, Adolf,

00:04:47,717 --> 00:04:48,885
and I'll tell you.

00:04:49,952 --> 00:04:52,355
You want some help?!

00:04:52,355 --> 00:04:53,923
PHILLIPS:
<i>22...</i>

00:04:53,923 --> 00:04:57,794
23, 24, 25...

00:04:57,794 --> 00:05:00,036
26 and 27.

00:05:00,036 --> 00:05:04,040
Final count is
27 sharp force injuries

00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,735
to the upper torso

00:05:05,735 --> 00:05:07,038
and neck region.

00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:09,037
Prison is an ugly place
to get killed.

00:05:09,037 --> 00:05:12,642
ROBBINS: I will be sure to
put that in my report

00:05:12,642 --> 00:05:13,810
under bonus features:

00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:17,480
"David Phillips on Life
Behind Bars: It Sucks."

00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,816
I'm just saying that lack
of access to real weapons

00:05:19,816 --> 00:05:21,751
leads to some
unnecessary roughness.

00:05:22,985 --> 00:05:26,422
You just missed David's elegy
on prison life.

00:05:26,422 --> 00:05:28,758
I'll have to wait
for the CD, I guess.
Hmm.

00:05:28,758 --> 00:05:30,760
Oh, Vance.

00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,043
Used to be a
good-looking guy.

00:05:33,043 --> 00:05:34,630
Charming.

00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,466
Not someone you'd want
to cross, though.

00:05:36,466 --> 00:05:38,041
So what have you got?

00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:39,669
Well, C.O.D. is obvious.

00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:42,505
Exsanguination due to
multiple sharp force injuries.

00:05:42,505 --> 00:05:45,036
None deeper than two inches.

00:05:45,036 --> 00:05:46,742
Left and right
jugular-carotid complex

00:05:46,742 --> 00:05:48,911
are pretty much shredded.

00:05:48,911 --> 00:05:52,037
So the assailant should
be covered in blood.

00:05:53,349 --> 00:05:56,039
It's a roughly triangular-shaped

00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:57,453
piece of metal,

00:05:57,453 --> 00:05:58,654
sharpened to a point.

00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,894
(shouting)

00:06:04,894 --> 00:06:08,042
Wounds are consistent
with a right-handed assailant.

00:06:28,042 --> 00:06:30,620
(indistinct, distant voices)

00:07:06,622 --> 00:07:09,035
BRASS: Find anything
interesting?

00:07:09,035 --> 00:07:10,960
Uh...

00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,039
It looks like Vance was
appealing his conviction

00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:15,598
on grounds of new evidence.

00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:18,036
What new evidence?
Uh...

00:07:18,036 --> 00:07:19,902
Police bias.

00:07:19,902 --> 00:07:22,972
Stuff like that. I still have
a lot of work to do here, Jim.

00:07:22,972 --> 00:07:26,609
You know, if I were in prison
for killing my wife,

00:07:26,609 --> 00:07:30,713
I don't think I'd put
her photo on the wall.

00:07:30,713 --> 00:07:33,783
Wow. She's sexy.

00:07:33,783 --> 00:07:36,485
Yeah, yeah. Well,
she's good-looking.

00:07:36,485 --> 00:07:38,387
BRASS: Yeah. I remember Anne-
Marie's first day on the job.

00:07:38,387 --> 00:07:39,589
She walked in the squad room

00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:42,525
and every guy's neck
practically snapped.

00:07:42,525 --> 00:07:43,926
She knew how to work it, too.

00:07:43,926 --> 00:07:45,928
Was she married
to Vance back then?

00:07:45,928 --> 00:07:47,043
No. They didn't hook up

00:07:47,043 --> 00:07:49,036
till after she was
transferred to Brime.

00:07:49,036 --> 00:07:50,733
Marriage was a mistake.

00:07:50,733 --> 00:07:52,635
She wasn't
the settling-down type.

00:07:52,635 --> 00:07:55,571
Vance told anybody
who would listen

00:07:55,571 --> 00:07:57,540
that he'd never let her go.

00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,342
Could be why he killed her.

00:07:59,342 --> 00:08:00,610
A woman like Anne-Marie

00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:03,913
could make a man do a lot
of things he'd regret.

00:08:10,853 --> 00:08:12,388
Hey.

00:08:12,388 --> 00:08:15,925
Hey. So I, uh, pulled
the video surveillance.

00:08:15,925 --> 00:08:16,959
It's a total pile-on.

00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:18,661
You can't really see anything.

00:08:18,661 --> 00:08:19,929
Nice colors, though.

00:08:19,929 --> 00:08:21,037
Kind of like
a Redskins game.

00:08:21,037 --> 00:08:22,043
With one dead Cowboy.

00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:25,039
SANDERS: And someone else
calling the plays.

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,336
One guy gives
the other a signal.

00:08:27,336 --> 00:08:29,505
No way this jumped off
by accident.

00:08:29,505 --> 00:08:31,034
And only one guy gets stuck.

00:08:31,034 --> 00:08:32,875
An ex-cop.

00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:34,677
This was a hit.

00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:44,035
♪ ♪

00:09:00,469 --> 00:09:01,804

So, if we say that our victim,

00:09:14,984 --> 00:09:17,386
Vance Tolsom,

00:09:17,386 --> 00:09:19,035
was here...

00:09:19,035 --> 00:09:20,036
Well, the trajectory

00:09:20,036 --> 00:09:21,390
of the blood spatter

00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:24,042
and the void
on his right side

00:09:24,042 --> 00:09:27,863
would put
Jose Castia here.

00:09:27,863 --> 00:09:31,467
The bloodstains
and the void on Carlos Salavar

00:09:31,467 --> 00:09:34,437
would put him here.

00:09:34,437 --> 00:09:38,034
Which just leaves
Tomas Molinez.

00:09:38,034 --> 00:09:41,036
Arterial
spurting pattern,

00:09:41,036 --> 00:09:42,037
straight shot,

00:09:42,037 --> 00:09:45,035
no void,
would put him

00:09:45,035 --> 00:09:46,415
directly in front
of our victim.

00:09:50,453 --> 00:09:52,755
(sighs)

00:09:52,755 --> 00:09:55,424
Carlos,

00:09:55,424 --> 00:09:58,594
Jose...

00:09:58,594 --> 00:10:00,830
slide in from
the side.

00:10:02,042 --> 00:10:06,036
Probably pin Vance's arms down.

00:10:06,036 --> 00:10:07,603
(screaming)

00:10:07,603 --> 00:10:08,738
(clamoring)

00:10:08,738 --> 00:10:10,406
They were just the wing-men.

00:10:10,406 --> 00:10:13,743
Looks like we found our doer.

00:10:13,743 --> 00:10:15,411
BRASS:
Tomas Molinez.

00:10:15,411 --> 00:10:18,347
Formerly employed by
Riverton, Marx and Flegel,

00:10:18,347 --> 00:10:19,782
Certified Public
Accountants.

00:10:19,782 --> 00:10:22,351
So you're currently two
years into a 30-year bid

00:10:22,351 --> 00:10:25,755
for a triple fatal DUI.

00:10:25,755 --> 00:10:27,723
Family in a van.

00:10:27,723 --> 00:10:30,037
So you're the one
holding the shiv.

00:10:30,037 --> 00:10:32,037
So if I were you, Tomas,

00:10:32,037 --> 00:10:35,040
I'd make a deal
with me. Now.

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,732
Last time I heard that,

00:10:36,732 --> 00:10:38,934
I got stuck with 30 years.

00:10:38,934 --> 00:10:41,804
You have no idea what it's like
to be in that place.

00:10:41,804 --> 00:10:42,905
No, I don't.

00:10:42,905 --> 00:10:44,673
Because
I don't drink and drive.

00:10:44,673 --> 00:10:47,743
Look, you're still a
relatively young man.

00:10:47,743 --> 00:10:49,678
I mean, let's make
a deal. Let's talk.

00:10:49,678 --> 00:10:51,040
Shave off a few years,

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,550
so you don't have to
leave prison in a walker.

00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:56,886
You know?
You think I'm an idiot.

00:10:56,886 --> 00:10:58,854
Look, I killed a cop.

00:10:58,854 --> 00:11:03,034
I am tired
of being everybody's bitch.

00:11:03,034 --> 00:11:06,036
Cop killer?
That's a different story.

00:11:06,036 --> 00:11:09,036
It gives me status, juice.

00:11:11,667 --> 00:11:14,937
Even if I get life, it's still
better than what I've got now.

00:11:14,937 --> 00:11:16,939
Man...

00:11:16,939 --> 00:11:18,941
(sighs)

00:11:20,342 --> 00:11:22,411
Well, that is sad.

00:11:22,411 --> 00:11:24,036
All right, look,
we deal on that,

00:11:24,036 --> 00:11:25,514
but you know
how this works.

00:11:25,514 --> 00:11:27,950
You got to give something to get
something, so give me something.

00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:31,034
Look, if I rat,
I am dead tomorrow.

00:11:31,034 --> 00:11:32,039
So you can't give me names.

00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:33,956
So give me a reason why.
Why the cop?

00:11:33,956 --> 00:11:36,559
Someone have issues
with him on the inside?

00:11:38,594 --> 00:11:41,630
Look, I overheard some<i>chisme.</i>

00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:45,042
The hit was a favor
for somebody

00:11:45,042 --> 00:11:47,570
on the outside.

00:11:50,036 --> 00:11:52,043
STOKES:
Hey, Catherine,
you got a minute?

00:11:52,043 --> 00:11:53,809
Sure. What's up?

00:11:53,809 --> 00:11:56,812
You mind if I shut your door
for a second?

00:11:56,812 --> 00:11:58,948
All right.

00:12:00,816 --> 00:12:03,519
Wind-up's got me curious.

00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,041
Well, I found a little something
in Vance's cell.

00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:08,036
I thought I'd give you
a heads-up.

00:12:08,036 --> 00:12:10,926
Yeah, he was putting together
a case for a new trial,

00:12:10,926 --> 00:12:14,038
and apparently,
his wife was sleeping around

00:12:14,038 --> 00:12:16,532
before and after
they said "I do."

00:12:16,532 --> 00:12:18,034
Look, I knew Anne-Marie.

00:12:18,034 --> 00:12:19,335
She wasn't doing anything

00:12:19,335 --> 00:12:21,040
the guys in the
department weren't doing.

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,035
Yeah, 'cause they were
all doing it with her.

00:12:23,035 --> 00:12:24,773
Yeah, and probably
getting attaboyed for it.

00:12:24,773 --> 00:12:26,040
Double standard.

00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,744
The point is, he put together
a list of bedfellows.

00:12:28,744 --> 00:12:30,746
I don't know where
this list came from,

00:12:30,746 --> 00:12:33,482
or why it didn't come up
at his trial, but listen.

00:12:33,482 --> 00:12:36,452
It reads like a who's who of
Southern Nevada law enforcement.

00:12:36,452 --> 00:12:37,653
Anybody we know?

00:12:37,653 --> 00:12:40,043
Ecklie's on there.

00:12:40,043 --> 00:12:42,038
Really?

00:12:42,038 --> 00:12:44,034
Wow. Oh, good for him.

00:12:44,034 --> 00:12:46,039
Brass, too.
Well,

00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:48,430
Jim used to be a player
back in the day.

00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:50,633
Kind of had that Jersey,
Jack Nicholson thing.

00:12:50,633 --> 00:12:52,039
Who else?
Ah, let's
see here.

00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:55,035
Atwater, Bastille,
Bracket, Brooks,

00:12:55,035 --> 00:12:56,572
Cavaliere. I'm only
up to the C's.

00:12:56,572 --> 00:12:57,873
You want me to keep going?

00:12:57,873 --> 00:12:59,035
Uh, let me guess.

00:12:59,035 --> 00:13:00,476
Vega? Um, McKeen,
for sure, right?

00:13:00,476 --> 00:13:01,644
Mm-hmm.

00:13:01,644 --> 00:13:03,445
Vartann

00:13:03,445 --> 00:13:04,813
is on here, as well.

00:13:04,813 --> 00:13:07,883
Sorry to be the one
to break that to you.

00:13:07,883 --> 00:13:10,753
Ancient history.

00:13:10,753 --> 00:13:12,855
Well, according
to Vance's notes, he's convinced

00:13:12,855 --> 00:13:16,458
that Anne-Marie's real murderer
is a cop on this list.

00:13:22,898 --> 00:13:27,041
Well, half these guys
worked Anne-Marie's murder.

00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:29,036
Yeah, I know. I read the file.

00:13:29,036 --> 00:13:34,037
Brass was lead for LVPD,
and Vartann was his second.

00:13:34,037 --> 00:13:36,035
Why didn't those guys
recuse themselves?

00:13:36,035 --> 00:13:37,446
(mutters):
I don't know.

00:13:37,446 --> 00:13:41,483
Book the evidence,
make me copies, I'll take care

00:13:41,483 --> 00:13:42,651
of the notifications.

00:13:42,651 --> 00:13:44,386
Oh, boy, when this

00:13:44,386 --> 00:13:47,040
hits the fan, it's going
to come back on all of us.

00:13:51,593 --> 00:13:54,042
So, I was riding the party train
pretty nonstop back then.

00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:57,766
I mean, work was like
an interruption to my fun, yeah.

00:13:57,766 --> 00:14:01,036
So, um, there was a homicide
convention in New Orleans.

00:14:01,036 --> 00:14:02,571
Anne-Marie was there.

00:14:02,571 --> 00:14:04,440
She was certainly sexy,

00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,543
and-and available,
so we hooked up, and, um,

00:14:07,543 --> 00:14:09,042
when Anne-Marie was murdered,

00:14:09,042 --> 00:14:11,880
I went up the chain of command,
I-I... I told my boss

00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,038
about our involvement,
he told me not to sweat it.

00:14:14,038 --> 00:14:16,852
You know,
I-I did the right thing, yeah.

00:14:16,852 --> 00:14:18,041
So what about you, Conrad?

00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:20,823
Well, I didn't handle any of the
evidence. My team did.

00:14:20,823 --> 00:14:22,891
And it was just...

00:14:22,891 --> 00:14:25,394
It was... It was just
dinner with benefits.

00:14:25,394 --> 00:14:27,763
Anne-Marie stopped by the lab
to discuss a case.

00:14:27,763 --> 00:14:29,037
She was hungry.

00:14:29,037 --> 00:14:31,934
One thing led to another,
and to a...

00:14:31,934 --> 00:14:34,737
to a room at the Gold Coast.

00:14:34,737 --> 00:14:36,036
BRASS:
Gold Coast.

00:14:36,036 --> 00:14:37,339
Couldn't do any better
than that?

00:14:37,339 --> 00:14:38,674
You know,

00:14:38,674 --> 00:14:40,876
Anne-Marie's car
was found on the county line.

00:14:40,876 --> 00:14:42,611
I mean,
LVPD assisted Brime Sheriffs,

00:14:42,611 --> 00:14:44,713
but Brime was in charge
of the investigation.

00:14:44,713 --> 00:14:46,582
Plenty of Brime guys
on that list.

00:14:46,582 --> 00:14:48,034
WILLOWS:
Look, Vance

00:14:48,034 --> 00:14:50,953
got whacked just as he was about
to get a new trial,

00:14:50,953 --> 00:14:52,042
dredge up the past.

00:14:52,042 --> 00:14:54,556
Maybe somebody didn't want
the truth to come out.

00:14:54,556 --> 00:14:57,035
Yeah, somebody
who could reach into prison.

00:14:57,035 --> 00:14:58,727
Well, those two bangers
who put Tomas Molinez up

00:14:58,727 --> 00:15:00,039
for the hit--
they're from Brime County.

00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:02,698
Okay, so that's where we start,
with the bangers.

00:15:33,595 --> 00:15:35,597
♪ ♪

00:16:12,835 --> 00:16:15,938
Jose, is this medical marijuana?

00:16:17,673 --> 00:16:19,575
What's the matter?
You depressed about something?

00:16:19,575 --> 00:16:21,039
LANGSTON:
You on the family plan?

00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:22,978
You know, texting can be
very expensive,

00:16:22,978 --> 00:16:25,647
Carlos. Could get you
another five years.

00:16:25,647 --> 00:16:27,683
WARDEN:
Gentlemen, ran across
something interesting

00:16:27,683 --> 00:16:28,884
in the visitor log.

00:16:28,884 --> 00:16:30,037
Yeah? What's what?

00:16:30,037 --> 00:16:31,043
Other than
his lawyer,

00:16:31,043 --> 00:16:34,456
Vance has had only one
visitor, Jody Cambry.

00:16:34,456 --> 00:16:37,493
Who's Jody Cambry?
His dead
wife's sister.

00:16:37,493 --> 00:16:39,862
She was here pretty much
every week for three months.

00:16:39,862 --> 00:16:41,040
Guy kills her sister.

00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,698
Why would she come visit him?

00:16:42,698 --> 00:16:45,034
Maybe she wanted
to see the man suffer.

00:16:45,034 --> 00:16:47,037
WOMAN:
<i>Yeah, I hated him.</i>

00:16:47,037 --> 00:16:49,738
And I hated the fact
he wouldn't leave me alone.

00:16:49,738 --> 00:16:51,740
Wrote to me every week.

00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:54,376
I just threw his letters away.

00:16:54,376 --> 00:16:56,345
So, why'd you go see him?

00:16:56,345 --> 00:16:59,348
One day, I opened up
one of his letters.

00:16:59,348 --> 00:17:00,949
He wanted to talk.

00:17:00,949 --> 00:17:03,385
He had something important
he needed to tell me.

00:17:03,385 --> 00:17:07,756
I thought maybe he would tell
me where he buried Anne-Marie.

00:17:07,756 --> 00:17:09,825
That's not what happened.

00:17:09,825 --> 00:17:11,039
Hmm.

00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,795
Vance swore up and down
that he was innocent.

00:17:13,795 --> 00:17:15,364
That it was all a setup.

00:17:15,364 --> 00:17:16,899
And you believed him?

00:17:16,899 --> 00:17:19,835
Enough that I started
looking into things.

00:17:19,835 --> 00:17:21,403
Talking to people.

00:17:21,403 --> 00:17:23,906
Annie's friends,
other cops, family.

00:17:25,507 --> 00:17:28,810
Everybody had a story about
some guy Annie had been with.

00:17:30,042 --> 00:17:32,042
Thing is,

00:17:32,042 --> 00:17:35,037
a lot of them had
investigated her murder.

00:17:35,037 --> 00:17:38,034
That's grounds for a new trial.

00:17:38,034 --> 00:17:41,037
So I started putting
together a list.

00:17:41,037 --> 00:17:44,359
What, you think one of the guys
on your list is the real killer?

00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:47,462
I think
Annie could make any guy crazy.

00:17:47,462 --> 00:17:49,698
Before she died,

00:17:49,698 --> 00:17:52,038
Annie told me
she'd fallen in love again.

00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:54,736
Said this guy was the one.

00:17:54,736 --> 00:17:57,043
She was going to leave Vance.

00:17:57,043 --> 00:17:58,874
She wouldn't tell me who he was.

00:17:58,874 --> 00:18:01,577
So he could be any one
of the guys on that list?

00:18:01,577 --> 00:18:04,035
All I know is
that he was a cop.

00:18:04,035 --> 00:18:05,747
Annie only dated cops.

00:18:05,747 --> 00:18:08,617
I also know Vance was
never going to let her go.

00:18:10,034 --> 00:18:13,034
So... whoever she
was leading on...

00:18:15,034 --> 00:18:17,043
...she was playing
a dangerous game.

00:18:17,043 --> 00:18:19,461
Why didn't you bring up
any of this at the trial?

00:18:19,461 --> 00:18:21,042
Because back then,
like everyone else,

00:18:21,042 --> 00:18:22,598
I thought
Vance killed her.

00:18:22,598 --> 00:18:25,034
What makes you
so sure he didn't?

00:18:25,034 --> 00:18:26,935
I just know.

00:18:28,043 --> 00:18:30,939
I just know.

00:18:30,939 --> 00:18:33,035
(crowd chatter)

00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:43,041
How's the leg?

00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:45,520
Ah, it's better.

00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,457
This is, uh...

00:18:48,457 --> 00:18:51,426
This is new, seeing you
outside of the office,

00:18:51,426 --> 00:18:53,662
middle of the day
with your clothes on.

00:18:55,664 --> 00:18:57,042
Well, I thought that maybe

00:18:57,042 --> 00:18:59,042
you and I should have
a cup of coffee.

00:18:59,042 --> 00:19:01,043
Okay.

00:19:01,043 --> 00:19:04,039
Excuse me?

00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:06,039
Um... (clears throat)

00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:10,039
You know, uh,

00:19:10,039 --> 00:19:12,347
I met Anne-Marie
at the Academy,

00:19:12,347 --> 00:19:15,043
and, uh, yes,

00:19:15,043 --> 00:19:17,853
we had some good times
over the years.

00:19:17,853 --> 00:19:20,589
It's all over the department
about the list.

00:19:20,589 --> 00:19:23,041
I guess I'm on it?
Is this my unofficial heads-up?

00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:26,038
Lou, you had a relationship
with a murder victim,

00:19:26,038 --> 00:19:28,040
you worked the case,

00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,040
and you didn't think you should
have recused yourself?

00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:34,038
Oh. So this is more
of an<i>officialheads-up.</i>

00:19:34,038 --> 00:19:37,035
Well, Vance claimed that
there was a rush to judgment.

00:19:37,035 --> 00:19:40,742
That you guys didn't even look
past him for the real killer.

00:19:40,742 --> 00:19:42,043
"You guys"?

00:19:42,043 --> 00:19:45,039
What? Are-Are you saying--
that, um, I didn't do my job

00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,036
because I had a thing
with Anne-Marie?

00:19:47,036 --> 00:19:50,039
When Warrick was murdered,
did you recuse yourself?

00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:52,354
Did your team
recuse themselves?

00:19:59,361 --> 00:20:00,896
Yeah, I'm sure.

00:20:00,896 --> 00:20:02,998
Look, he threatened Anne-Marie
more than once, all right?

00:20:02,998 --> 00:20:04,499
In front of other cops.

00:20:04,499 --> 00:20:07,836

to leave me, I'll kill you."

What was your evidence?

00:20:09,638 --> 00:20:10,839
Oh, come on.

00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:12,674
Really, you want me to run it?

00:20:12,674 --> 00:20:14,037
I do.

Anne-Marie's blood
and added an anticoagulant.

00:22:46,035 --> 00:22:48,463
Now, the only reason somebody
would do something like that

00:22:48,463 --> 00:22:50,035

in 1995,

00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,462
a torched car in Salt Lake

00:23:20,462 --> 00:23:22,531
traced back to a murder
in Brime County.

00:23:22,531 --> 00:23:25,433
Suspect was arrested in Pahrump.

00:23:34,776 --> 00:23:36,912
Lucas Martin.
He was the lead detective

was Anne-Marie's
mystery lover.

00:23:52,761 --> 00:23:55,363
Why isn't he on the list?
The sister didn't

00:23:55,363 --> 00:23:58,035
know his name-- she just assumed
he was a cop on that list.

00:23:58,035 --> 00:24:01,870
Okay. (sighs) Lucas Martin was
Anne-Marie's final conquest.

00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:03,572
When she wouldn't
leave Vance for him,

00:24:03,572 --> 00:24:05,707
he snapped, killed her,
and framed Vance for it,

00:24:05,707 --> 00:24:08,042
and he did it by taking cues
from his old cases.

00:24:08,042 --> 00:24:10,345
STOKES:
Anne-Marie's body
was never found.

00:24:10,345 --> 00:24:12,981

Lucas Martin killed Anne-Marie,

00:25:02,041 --> 00:25:04,733

of his old cases

00:25:04,733 --> 00:25:05,867

the same way.

00:25:11,473 --> 00:25:12,907

killed his girlfriend,

00:25:15,035 --> 00:25:16,411
dumped her body.

00:25:16,411 --> 00:25:18,647

00:30:00,428 --> 00:30:01,829
No, not<i>thatgun.</i>

00:30:01,829 --> 00:30:04,036
We're cops--
we have guns that have guns.

00:30:04,036 --> 00:30:06,968
I'm talking about the attaboy
that Judge Grantson gave you

00:30:06,968 --> 00:30:08,336
after the Domingo Flan trial.

00:30:08,336 --> 00:30:09,504
That gun.

00:30:09,504 --> 00:30:10,738
The Sig nine-mil.

00:30:10,738 --> 00:30:12,941
It was in the database
before you even got it.

00:30:12,941 --> 00:30:15,810
And ballistics matched it
to the Jody Cambry murder.

00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:17,412
I don't have that gun anymore.

00:30:17,412 --> 00:30:18,947
Well, that's a relief.

00:30:18,947 --> 00:30:21,036
That means there's a record,
assuming that you went through

00:30:21,036 --> 00:30:24,042
proper channels to sell it.
I sold it to a guy
at a gun show.

00:30:24,042 --> 00:30:25,043
Out of state.

00:30:25,043 --> 00:30:26,721
Well, now it's in state.

00:30:26,721 --> 00:30:28,038
Maybe it got homesick.

00:30:28,038 --> 00:30:30,041
You charging me?

00:30:30,041 --> 00:30:31,793
As a matter of fact, I am.

00:30:31,793 --> 00:30:33,795
You better lawyer up
and call the union,

00:30:33,795 --> 00:30:35,036
'cause you're under arrest.

00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:38,599
Did you hear
the good news?

00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:40,635
Brass booked Lucas Martin
for Jody's murder,

00:30:40,635 --> 00:30:42,036
and that's just
for starters.

00:30:42,036 --> 00:30:44,439
Well, there might
be a problem.

00:30:44,439 --> 00:30:47,039
(wry chuckle)
I am too tired to
hear that, Ray.

00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:49,877
Jody died yesterday,
20-hundred hours.

00:30:49,877 --> 00:30:51,512
I checked the duty log.

00:30:51,512 --> 00:30:53,034
Lucas Martin was working.

00:30:53,034 --> 00:30:54,041
Well, that doesn't actually mean

00:30:54,041 --> 00:30:55,917
that he was working
the entire time.

00:30:55,917 --> 00:30:58,686
I knew a cop once who painted
his house while on duty.

00:30:58,686 --> 00:31:00,042
It's still an alibi.

00:31:00,042 --> 00:31:02,857
What about the epithelials
under Jody's nails?

00:31:02,857 --> 00:31:04,034
Still waiting for results.

00:31:04,034 --> 00:31:06,043
Look, if Martin ordered
the hit on Vance,

00:31:06,043 --> 00:31:08,930
he must have reached out
to Carlos Salavar.

00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:11,766
Carlos isn't talking, Ray.

00:31:11,766 --> 00:31:14,038
Maybe he'll listen.

00:31:15,336 --> 00:31:17,872
Where are the real cops at,
lab rat?

00:31:17,872 --> 00:31:20,508
I thought we'd have
a conversation, you and me.

00:31:20,508 --> 00:31:23,041
Conversation.
Mm-hmm.

00:31:23,041 --> 00:31:26,381
So you don't want to stick
nothing in my mouth, hm?

00:31:26,381 --> 00:31:27,882
That's what
y'all do, right?

00:31:27,882 --> 00:31:29,684
I know that Lucas Martin
contacted you

00:31:29,684 --> 00:31:31,486
and put the hit on that cop.

00:31:31,486 --> 00:31:32,954
You don't know jack.

00:31:32,954 --> 00:31:34,956
I got your phone, Carlos,
all your texts

00:31:34,956 --> 00:31:37,358
to your sister Reina
about your nephew Chuy

00:31:37,358 --> 00:31:39,560
getting busted for drugs
and going to jail.

00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:42,043
I know she has four
other kids at home.

00:31:42,043 --> 00:31:45,041
She never had $5,000
to pay Chuy's bail.

00:31:45,041 --> 00:31:46,868
Then all of a sudden,

00:31:46,868 --> 00:31:48,043
she has $5,000?

00:31:48,043 --> 00:31:50,034
Five G's just like that?

00:31:50,034 --> 00:31:51,472
(quietly)
You and I both know

00:31:51,472 --> 00:31:53,674
where that kind of money
comes from, don't we?

00:31:53,674 --> 00:31:56,041
<i>Escucha, mi amigo.</i>

00:31:56,041 --> 00:31:59,514
<i>Amigo,one phone call,</i>
 they roll your sister up.

00:31:59,514 --> 00:32:02,483
Her kids, they go
to Child Services.

00:32:02,483 --> 00:32:05,038
You know what happens in
Child Services, don't you?

00:32:05,038 --> 00:32:08,041
Oh, that's right...
you grew up there.
(grunting)

00:32:08,041 --> 00:32:10,625
You want to swell up, go ahead--
call somebody in here;

00:32:10,625 --> 00:32:12,043
they can help
you with that.

00:32:12,043 --> 00:32:14,041
You gonna let
your sister go down

00:32:14,041 --> 00:32:17,041
and those kids go
into Child Services
because of a cop?

00:32:19,867 --> 00:32:22,035
I'm gonna ask you
one more time, Carlos.

00:32:22,035 --> 00:32:25,035
Where did your sister
get the $5,000?

00:32:26,036 --> 00:32:28,976
<i>Que baboso.</i>

00:32:28,976 --> 00:32:32,041
You got no idea, bro.

00:32:32,041 --> 00:32:35,041
I don't know no Lucas Martin.

00:32:35,041 --> 00:32:37,452
You got the wrong cop.

00:32:37,452 --> 00:32:39,040
(pounds table)

00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:43,558
(door opens and closes)

00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:45,760
(grunts)

00:32:50,631 --> 00:32:52,467
Sorry.

00:32:55,736 --> 00:32:56,938
(exhales)

00:32:56,938 --> 00:32:58,037
Running from
another stripper?

00:32:58,037 --> 00:32:59,540
Burlesque dancer.

00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:00,875
And that's not funny.

00:33:00,875 --> 00:33:02,376
I'm sorry.

00:33:02,376 --> 00:33:03,811
So I ran
the epithelials

00:33:03,811 --> 00:33:05,041
from Jody Cambry's
fingernails.

00:33:05,041 --> 00:33:06,681
Yeah.
You're not going
to believe this.

00:33:06,681 --> 00:33:08,039
Try me.
Well,

00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:09,517
they didn't come
from Lucas Martin.

00:33:09,517 --> 00:33:11,035
In fact, they're not even male.

00:33:11,035 --> 00:33:13,354
Epithelials are
a sibling match

00:33:13,354 --> 00:33:14,856
to Jody.

00:33:14,856 --> 00:33:16,891
(scoffs)
What?

00:33:16,891 --> 00:33:21,362
Yeah, and Jody only has
one sibling-- Anne-Marie Tolsom.

00:33:21,362 --> 00:33:25,833
So that means
that Anne-Marie is alive.

00:33:31,756 --> 00:33:33,758
We thought that
all this evidence was planted

00:33:33,758 --> 00:33:35,285
to cover up a murder.

00:33:35,285 --> 00:33:36,894
We now know that it was planted

00:33:36,894 --> 00:33:38,763
to cover Anne-Marie's
disappearance.

00:33:38,763 --> 00:33:42,099
And put Vance in prison for
a crime he didn't commit.

00:33:42,099 --> 00:33:43,292
I thought he was
good for it.

00:33:43,292 --> 00:33:45,236
Yeah, me, too.
I believe
you were led

00:33:45,236 --> 00:33:47,938
by Lucas Martin
and Anne-Marie.

00:33:47,938 --> 00:33:49,907
For love.

00:33:49,907 --> 00:33:52,143
Martin helped her to get
out from under Vance.

00:33:52,143 --> 00:33:53,289
Great, we just solved
a four-year-old case

00:33:53,289 --> 00:33:54,779
we didn't even know was open.

00:33:54,779 --> 00:33:57,284
We still got two real murders
with two real bodies.

00:33:57,284 --> 00:33:59,116
Well, if you believe
the gangbanger,

00:33:59,116 --> 00:34:00,751
Martin's not helping her
anymore.

00:34:00,751 --> 00:34:02,287
Yeah, some other cop put
the hit out on Vance?

00:34:02,287 --> 00:34:04,289
Give me a break.
Martin's gun shot Jody.

00:34:04,289 --> 00:34:06,690
We found her at one
of his old body dump sites.

00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:08,286
I mean, it sounds to me
like he's helping her.

00:34:08,286 --> 00:34:09,994
Well, I hate to defend the guy,
but, you know, really,

00:34:09,994 --> 00:34:12,663
a cop using his own gun
that he knows is in the system--

00:34:12,663 --> 00:34:14,198
I mean, that is beyond dumb.

00:34:14,198 --> 00:34:15,633
Martin said
he had gotten rid of the gun,

00:34:15,633 --> 00:34:17,935
and any cop in Brime County

00:34:17,935 --> 00:34:19,287
should know
about that dump site.

00:34:19,287 --> 00:34:21,138
Well, the evidence puts
Anne-Marie at the scene.

00:34:21,138 --> 00:34:23,140
Maybe the gun was
in her hand.

00:34:26,291 --> 00:34:29,680
BRASS: Who'd you give
the gun to, Lucas?

00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,849
No gun show story?
'Cause that was funny.

00:34:31,849 --> 00:34:33,117
I could listen
to that again.

00:34:33,117 --> 00:34:34,785
I didn't kill Jody.

00:34:34,785 --> 00:34:36,921
You know, I want to believe
you, man, I'm trying,

00:34:36,921 --> 00:34:39,290
but all the evidence
points to you...

00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:41,926
unless you gave your gun
to Anne-Marie, you know.

00:34:41,926 --> 00:34:46,230
Oh, yeah, surprise, we, we know
that Anne-Marie is still alive,

00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:48,291
and we know the two of you
framed Vance for murder

00:34:48,291 --> 00:34:49,934
and now she's throwing you
under the bus

00:34:49,934 --> 00:34:51,291
and trying to frame you.

00:34:53,003 --> 00:34:56,006
Hey... I get it.

00:34:57,007 --> 00:34:59,710
I get the obsession.

00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:01,289
Anne-Marie is a force
of nature, you know.

00:35:01,289 --> 00:35:02,913
She makes everybody feel like

00:35:02,913 --> 00:35:04,748
you're the only
guy in the world.

00:35:04,748 --> 00:35:06,750
I get it.

00:35:09,286 --> 00:35:12,189
I loved her.

00:35:12,189 --> 00:35:13,293
Still do.

00:35:13,293 --> 00:35:16,160
We were in love,
we were going to be together,

00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,630
and we both know Vance is
a bad guy-- bad to her.

00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:21,966
I didn't want him
coming after us.

00:35:21,966 --> 00:35:24,602
So you put Vance in prison,
Anne-Marie disappears,

00:35:24,602 --> 00:35:27,292
and, uh, you, you, uh,
you tag along later.

00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:28,739
That the plan?

00:35:28,739 --> 00:35:31,284
That was the plan.

00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:36,814
I'd wait a couple years,
put in my papers.

00:35:36,814 --> 00:35:39,817
End of the summer,
I'm retiring.

00:35:39,817 --> 00:35:41,785
Meanwhile, I see her
when I can.

00:35:41,785 --> 00:35:43,854
Mm-hmm, send her any money?

00:35:44,889 --> 00:35:46,957
That's a loaded
question,

00:35:46,957 --> 00:35:49,026
'cause we know that you're
sending $1,000 a month

00:35:49,026 --> 00:35:51,289
to some orphan fund in Mexico.

00:35:51,289 --> 00:35:53,063
$1,000 a month
on a cop's salary?

00:35:53,063 --> 00:35:55,633
And that's a lot of love
for the<i>poquito niños.</i>

00:35:55,633 --> 00:35:57,001
So here's
the new plan.

00:35:57,001 --> 00:36:00,137
What we're going to work on
is a minimum sentence

00:36:00,137 --> 00:36:03,641
at a minimum-
security prison.

00:36:03,641 --> 00:36:06,076
Tell me about the gun.

00:36:08,078 --> 00:36:10,915
I gave it to Annie
for protection.

00:36:10,915 --> 00:36:13,291
Where is she?

00:36:13,291 --> 00:36:15,586
I don't know.

00:36:15,586 --> 00:36:17,655
When I told her
I was putting in for retirement,

00:36:17,655 --> 00:36:21,859
she stopped returning my calls.

00:36:23,894 --> 00:36:25,896
Jim...

00:36:25,896 --> 00:36:28,287
I swear to you, I didn't
even know she was in town

00:36:28,287 --> 00:36:32,202
until you told me
Jody got popped with my gun.

00:36:33,203 --> 00:36:35,906
She's tough, huh?

00:36:35,906 --> 00:36:38,809
I mean, when
Anne-Marie dumps you,

00:36:38,809 --> 00:36:41,745
she really dumps you hard.

00:36:41,745 --> 00:36:43,289
All right.

00:36:43,289 --> 00:36:45,049
Well, all right, Jim.

00:36:45,049 --> 00:36:48,085
We're at Jody's place now,
so we'll see what we can dig up.

00:36:48,085 --> 00:36:50,854
All right, thanks.

00:36:50,854 --> 00:36:52,690
(phone beeps)
Hey, Anne-Marie dumped

00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:53,724
Lucas Martin
three months ago.

00:36:53,724 --> 00:36:55,059
Now, that's
right around

00:36:55,059 --> 00:36:57,728
the same time Jody started
visiting Vance in prison.

00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:59,285
I don't see any connection.

00:36:59,285 --> 00:37:01,198
Bye-bye,
sugar daddy.

00:37:01,198 --> 00:37:03,000
What's she going
to do for money now?

00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,284
Get a new daddy.

00:37:05,869 --> 00:37:07,237
Or...

00:37:07,237 --> 00:37:09,607
reach out to her schoolteacher
sister, who's collected

00:37:09,607 --> 00:37:11,286
on the life insurance.

00:37:19,717 --> 00:37:20,718
Here we go.

00:37:20,718 --> 00:37:22,289
On January 1,

00:37:22,289 --> 00:37:24,221
Jody's money market account
shows a balance

00:37:24,221 --> 00:37:25,290
of half a million and change.

00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:28,959
The account was opened
two years ago.

00:37:28,959 --> 00:37:31,195
Well, that sounds like
Anne-Marie's life insurance.
Mm-hmm.

00:37:31,195 --> 00:37:33,030
SANDERS: That's about
what a cop gets.

00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:34,293
STOKES: Jody had a big heart.

00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:36,834
On January 5, she transferred
half the money

00:37:36,834 --> 00:37:38,287
to an orphans' fund in Mexico.

00:37:38,287 --> 00:37:39,937
SANDERS: "Save the Niños."

00:37:39,937 --> 00:37:42,640
That's the same charity that
Lucas Martin was donating to.

00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,142
Jody knew Anne-Marie was alive.

00:37:45,142 --> 00:37:47,287
Yeah, maybe not till
after January 5.

00:37:47,287 --> 00:37:49,046
Three months ago.

00:37:49,046 --> 00:37:50,289
You know, it all fits.

00:37:50,289 --> 00:37:52,650
Dump Lucas, reach
out to the sister.

00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:54,652
Yeah, well, Jody should have
reached out to the cops.

00:37:54,652 --> 00:37:56,787
Yeah, maybe she didn't want
to betray her sister

00:37:56,787 --> 00:37:58,922
<i>or maybe she didn't want to let</i>
<i>Vance rot in prison either.</i>

00:37:58,922 --> 00:38:00,591
<i>That's probably</i>
<i>why she went to go see him.</i>

00:38:00,591 --> 00:38:03,286
<i>She knew he was innocent.</i>

00:38:03,286 --> 00:38:06,764
There's a bunch of payments
to a law firm...

00:38:06,764 --> 00:38:09,066
and one final transaction--

00:38:09,066 --> 00:38:13,293
$110,000 wire transfer to
Save the Niños Orphans' Fund...

00:38:13,293 --> 00:38:15,205
in Mexico...

00:38:15,205 --> 00:38:17,908
last night...

00:38:17,908 --> 00:38:20,177
11:47 p.m.

00:38:20,177 --> 00:38:23,614
At 11:47,
Jody was already dead,

00:38:23,614 --> 00:38:25,683
Lucas Martin
was in jail.

00:38:25,683 --> 00:38:27,851
Anne-Marie was here.

00:38:27,851 --> 00:38:29,953
She cleaned out
Jody's account.

00:38:31,588 --> 00:38:33,657
I think I know why
Anne-Marie took the risk

00:38:33,657 --> 00:38:34,992
of coming back to Vegas.

00:38:34,992 --> 00:38:37,284
She had to stop Vance from
getting a second trial.

00:38:37,284 --> 00:38:38,896
Killing him would have
eliminated that problem,

00:38:38,896 --> 00:38:40,287
but there was still Jody.

00:38:40,287 --> 00:38:42,733
There was always a chance that
Jody would rat out her sister.

00:38:42,733 --> 00:38:44,293
Right, so Anne-Marie had
to kill her, too.

00:38:44,293 --> 00:38:46,284
Why are you doing this?

00:38:46,284 --> 00:38:47,905
I would have kept
your secret.

00:38:47,905 --> 00:38:49,286
For how long?
You're my sister.

00:38:49,286 --> 00:38:50,291
Forever.

00:38:50,291 --> 00:38:52,286
Who better to frame
for Jody's murder

00:38:52,286 --> 00:38:53,610
than Lucas Martin?

00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:55,287
And we thought that Lucas killed
Jody, and we thought

00:38:55,287 --> 00:38:57,915
that he arranged for
the hit on Vance, but he didn't.

00:38:57,915 --> 00:38:59,216
So who did?

00:38:59,216 --> 00:39:02,119
Maybe another cop.
It's a long list.

00:39:02,119 --> 00:39:05,122
(chuckles) I wish I knew that
many guys I could depend on.

00:39:05,122 --> 00:39:07,825
You just need one.

00:39:07,825 --> 00:39:11,962
Uh, should I stay,
or is this case-related?

00:39:11,962 --> 00:39:13,289
Stay.

00:39:13,289 --> 00:39:14,765
While at the Academy,

00:39:14,765 --> 00:39:17,601
Anne-Marie was with a lot
of guys, pre-list.

00:39:17,601 --> 00:39:19,284
Anyway, I was trying
to make a connection

00:39:19,284 --> 00:39:20,804
between Anne-Marie
and the prison,

00:39:20,804 --> 00:39:23,741
and I remembered this guy
from the Academy who--

00:39:23,741 --> 00:39:24,742
he couldn't cut it,

00:39:24,742 --> 00:39:26,610
got tossed.

00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:29,146
The two of them were close--
you know, friends.

00:39:29,146 --> 00:39:30,681
Well, apparently
he started

00:39:30,681 --> 00:39:34,651
a new career
in corrections.

00:39:34,651 --> 00:39:36,019
LANGSTON:
Jarrod Malone.

00:39:36,019 --> 00:39:37,284
He's a C.O.

00:39:37,284 --> 00:39:39,288
He's on Vance's cell block.

00:39:39,288 --> 00:39:40,624
Yeah, what are the odds?

00:39:41,825 --> 00:39:43,827
(jail door clanging)

00:39:43,827 --> 00:39:47,286
Annie, people are starting
to ask questions.

00:39:47,286 --> 00:39:49,099
Okay?
It's not going to be okay.

00:39:49,099 --> 00:39:52,136
Lucas got busted; he's going
down, I could be next.

00:39:54,292 --> 00:39:57,908
How do I know what he said?

00:39:57,908 --> 00:39:59,284
Look, we got to act fast.

00:39:59,284 --> 00:40:01,284
Where are you?
I'll meet you.

00:40:02,291 --> 00:40:05,293
My shift's over at midnight.

00:40:05,293 --> 00:40:07,293
I'll be there.

00:40:36,013 --> 00:40:39,016
♪ ♪

00:40:49,289 --> 00:40:51,962
Just had to make
sure you were alone.

00:40:55,799 --> 00:40:58,284
Not that I don't
trust you.

00:40:59,284 --> 00:41:01,292
It's kind of nice...

00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:04,241
but I'm not wearing

00:41:04,241 --> 00:41:06,176
a wire.

00:41:08,812 --> 00:41:11,215
Can I see your cell phone?

00:41:12,216 --> 00:41:15,586
(both chuckle)

00:41:15,586 --> 00:41:18,284
You're good;
it's not wired either.

00:41:18,284 --> 00:41:21,291
Well, a girl's got to be
real careful, you know.

00:41:23,292 --> 00:41:26,830
Especially when
she's dead.

00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:29,800
Got the tickets?

00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,802
Morning flight.

00:41:32,936 --> 00:41:36,073
Mr. and Mrs. Nobody.

00:41:41,288 --> 00:41:43,293
You're going
to love Mexico.

00:41:45,293 --> 00:41:47,285
You know, I think
I'm gonna like Costa Rica

00:41:47,285 --> 00:41:52,222
a little bit better,
along with a hundred grand.

00:41:52,222 --> 00:41:54,591
That wasn't the plan.

00:41:54,591 --> 00:41:58,161
I know, but I've been
thinking about that and,

00:41:58,161 --> 00:42:01,732
Vance and Lucas.

00:42:02,733 --> 00:42:04,067
And now you don't trust me?

00:42:04,067 --> 00:42:06,284
Jody was
your sister.

00:42:06,284 --> 00:42:07,291
You did that
to your family.

00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:08,805
She shouldn't have
gone to Vance.

00:42:08,805 --> 00:42:10,290
And so you took care
of both of 'em?

00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:12,042
Look, Jody was soft.

00:42:14,285 --> 00:42:17,881
She always needed
to fix things.

00:42:17,881 --> 00:42:21,718
She didn't understand men.

00:42:21,718 --> 00:42:23,854
And you,

00:42:23,854 --> 00:42:25,856
you can't be trusted.

00:42:28,592 --> 00:42:32,029
(both chuckle)

00:42:32,029 --> 00:42:34,698
You're right about that.

00:42:34,698 --> 00:42:37,668
(sirens wailing)

00:42:42,139 --> 00:42:44,293
Annie, I know you got a gun.

00:42:44,293 --> 00:42:45,876
I want to see your hands.

00:42:45,876 --> 00:42:46,910
On your knees.

00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:48,289
You son of a bitch.

00:42:48,289 --> 00:42:53,286
I like you, but not enough
to do 25 to life for you.

00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:56,720
BRASS:
I know what you're thinking--

00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,293
you already died once.

00:42:58,293 --> 00:43:00,691
But don't do it for real
this time, okay?

00:43:00,691 --> 00:43:05,128
Oh, come on, Jimmy, you wouldn't
shoot an unarmed woman,

00:43:05,128 --> 00:43:06,697
would you?
VARTANN:
I think he'd shoot you.

00:43:06,697 --> 00:43:08,288
I know I would.

00:43:08,288 --> 00:43:10,288
Turn around.

00:43:16,206 --> 00:43:18,284
Unarmed, huh?

00:43:21,011 --> 00:43:23,293
(patting)
Ooh.

00:43:23,293 --> 00:43:25,293
Seems like old
times, Lou.

00:43:27,084 --> 00:43:28,085
(handcuffs clicking)

00:43:28,085 --> 00:43:30,220
You always did
have the touch.

00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:32,589
Yeah, well,
you've lost yours.

00:43:32,589 --> 00:43:34,024
We don't need
to wire the guy.

00:43:34,024 --> 00:43:36,159
The whole world
is wired.

00:43:36,159 --> 00:43:38,662
I could hear your heart
beating from inside the van.

00:43:38,662 --> 00:43:42,132
You've been gone
a long time, baby.

00:43:42,132 --> 00:43:44,968
Now you're going away
for even longer.

00:43:46,003 --> 00:43:49,039
Let's see how many men
are on the jury.
