00:00:04,681 --> 00:00:08,740
Oh my god that one guy kept coming up
behind me and smelling my hair.

00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,538
What was with all
the short guys?

00:00:10,538 --> 00:00:13,508
He was like,
five feet tall.

00:00:13,508 --> 00:00:17,733
I know, he came
up to... there.

00:00:17,733 --> 00:00:19,514
Aw! There's not a
decent guy in there.

00:00:19,514 --> 00:00:21,516
The one who kept
grabbing my ass--

00:00:21,516 --> 00:00:23,518
total reject from
the Jersey Shore.

00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:26,733
At least he wasn't dragging
around an oxygen tank.

00:00:26,733 --> 00:00:28,740
Oh, ew.

00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:29,742
Oh...

00:00:29,742 --> 00:00:33,061
See the way he's
looking at her?

00:00:33,061 --> 00:00:35,330
It's like she's the
only girl in the world.

00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:36,497
I want that.

00:00:38,633 --> 00:00:40,268
Where are all
the good men?

00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:44,372
(screaming)

00:00:53,648 --> 00:00:55,734
(bystanders murmuring)

00:00:55,734 --> 00:00:57,685
MAN:
Step back, please. Step back.

00:01:06,427 --> 00:01:08,733
Smell that?

00:01:08,733 --> 00:01:10,365
Alcohol.

00:01:10,365 --> 00:01:12,742
Maybe this guy had a few too
many and fell off his balcony.

00:01:12,742 --> 00:01:16,742
Well, the back of his skull
is completely obliterated.

00:01:16,742 --> 00:01:20,734
Unfortunately, that won't help
us determine how far he fell.

00:01:23,578 --> 00:01:25,380
These injuries
could have occurred

00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,415
if he fell
five stories or 20.

00:01:28,683 --> 00:01:30,685
MADDIE:
It all happened so fast.

00:01:30,685 --> 00:01:34,055
It's like the guy just
fell out of the sky.

00:01:35,123 --> 00:01:36,624
What are you looking at?

00:01:36,624 --> 00:01:39,227
Oh, I'm sorry. You got
something in your, uh...

00:01:39,227 --> 00:01:40,261
I do?

00:01:40,261 --> 00:01:41,296
Yeah, it's okay.

00:01:41,296 --> 00:01:43,298
Don't move.

00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:48,069
What is it?

00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:50,238
Just a little piece of brains.

00:01:50,238 --> 00:01:53,441
You always said you were
looking for a guy with brains.

00:01:53,441 --> 00:01:57,111
I'm sorry. I make jokes
when I'm nervous.

00:01:57,111 --> 00:01:58,735
That's all right.
Just a couple more questions.

00:01:58,735 --> 00:02:00,740
Did you girls hear anything
before he hit the ground?

00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:04,385
Any yelling?
Screaming?

00:02:04,385 --> 00:02:07,055
I was just looking
for a nice guy.

00:02:07,055 --> 00:02:09,733
One with a pulse.

00:02:09,733 --> 00:02:11,059
Maybe a badge?

00:02:12,327 --> 00:02:15,741
Sorry... I flirt when
I'm nervous, too.

00:02:18,366 --> 00:02:20,068
Thank you.

00:02:24,572 --> 00:02:28,176
Victim is Brad Malone;
guest at the hotel.

00:02:28,176 --> 00:02:29,736
Bad couple of days.

00:02:29,736 --> 00:02:31,733
He was down
over 100 grand.

00:02:31,733 --> 00:02:33,414
Another $50,000
in unpaid markers.

00:02:33,414 --> 00:02:35,049
You got all of that for a hug?

00:02:35,049 --> 00:02:37,735
Jerry? He used to
work for my father.

00:02:37,735 --> 00:02:41,389
So he just handed over
the casino's financials?

00:02:41,389 --> 00:02:43,524
Come on. How well
do you know this guy?

00:02:43,524 --> 00:02:45,393
It's really not
what you're thinking.

00:02:45,393 --> 00:02:48,742
When Sam died, he... left me
a little piece of the Eclipse.

00:02:48,742 --> 00:02:51,299
How little?

00:02:52,733 --> 00:02:53,741
It's really no big deal.

00:02:53,741 --> 00:02:55,069
Then why haven't
you said anything?

00:02:55,069 --> 00:02:56,304
I don't want everyone to know.

00:02:56,304 --> 00:02:57,305
So now I'm "everyone"?

00:02:58,734 --> 00:03:00,738
Let's just... talk about
this some other time.

00:03:03,511 --> 00:03:07,648
Victim is Brad Malone.
He was in suite 730.

00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:09,150
Lost his shirt at the casino.

00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,733
LANGSTON:
And apparently his pants.

00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:12,086
NICK:
It could be a jumper.

00:03:12,086 --> 00:03:14,322
Vegas is the suicide
capital of America.

00:03:14,322 --> 00:03:16,090
Come to gamble,
see a show,

00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:17,369
kiss your life goodbye.

Jumper's name's Brad Malone.
Checked in four days ago.

00:04:06,733 --> 00:04:09,610
Divorced twice. No kids.

00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:11,245
And he was about
to file for bankruptcy.

00:04:11,245 --> 00:04:12,480
Not a lot to live for.

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,733
Hmm-mm.

00:04:20,388 --> 00:04:21,742
Clothes neatly folded.

00:04:24,058 --> 00:04:27,740
Phone and wallet
on the nightstand.

00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:30,364
Everything in its place.

00:04:30,364 --> 00:04:31,499
Consistent with suicide.

00:04:31,499 --> 00:04:33,568
You get your life in order
before you end it.

00:04:33,568 --> 00:04:35,036
There's no suicide note.

00:04:35,036 --> 00:04:38,039
Nah. They don't
typically leave one.

00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:45,279
Got a few recent e-mails.

00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,547
Past due notices.

00:04:51,285 --> 00:04:52,620
Offerings of joy?

00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:57,737
No. No signs of sexual activity.

00:04:57,737 --> 00:04:59,527
Looks like he spent
his last night alone.

00:05:03,064 --> 00:05:04,265
Door's locked.

00:05:08,369 --> 00:05:10,605
Latching mechanism only
operates from the inside.

00:05:10,605 --> 00:05:11,741
If he jumped off his balcony,

00:05:11,741 --> 00:05:13,641
how'd he lock the door
behind him?

00:05:13,641 --> 00:05:17,733
Well, maybe he didn't jump,
maybe he was pushed.

00:05:17,733 --> 00:05:21,382
Which means...
he wasn't alone.

00:05:21,382 --> 00:05:23,050
I'll check it for prints.
Yeah.

00:05:31,492 --> 00:05:34,462
We got a print.

00:05:39,233 --> 00:05:42,733
BRASS:
Okay, we have a double homicide.

00:05:42,733 --> 00:05:46,474
Landlord I.D.'d the bodies
as Lance and Denise Irwin.

00:05:46,474 --> 00:05:49,577
Their home was foreclosed
on four months ago,

00:05:49,577 --> 00:05:51,045
so they had to move here.

00:05:51,045 --> 00:05:53,381
Talk about a step down.
Yeah.

00:05:53,381 --> 00:05:55,149
Who called it in?
She did.

00:05:55,149 --> 00:05:57,351
The 911 operator said
all she could get out was,

00:05:57,351 --> 00:06:00,655
"Help me, help me,"
and then there was no response.

00:06:03,391 --> 00:06:05,092
SIDLE:
Huh. No blood on the phone.

00:06:05,092 --> 00:06:06,739
Lots of cast-off, though.

00:06:06,739 --> 00:06:09,497
On the couch,
the lamp, the ceiling...

00:06:13,434 --> 00:06:14,569
Did you see what happened?

00:06:16,337 --> 00:06:18,733
If you tell us,
I'll give you a cracker.

00:06:20,742 --> 00:06:23,177
Well, if he did see anything,
he's not talking.

00:06:23,177 --> 00:06:27,048
So we contacted Animal
Control for the parrot.

00:06:27,048 --> 00:06:28,741
You know, it's a
first floor unit.

00:06:28,741 --> 00:06:31,052
The window was open,
the screen was ripped,

00:06:31,052 --> 00:06:32,687
so that's probably
how the killer got in.

00:06:32,687 --> 00:06:33,740
Where's the husband?

00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:36,090
The husband
is in the bathroom.

00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:37,625
What's going on?
They dead?

00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:39,060
Can somebody get this guy out
of here? Take his information?

00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,733
BRASS: We'll be with you
in a minute, sir.

00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:41,741
OFFICER:
Let's go.

00:06:41,741 --> 00:06:43,734
MAN: Don't push!
I'm goin', okay?

00:06:46,234 --> 00:06:48,035
Whew.

00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,738
Slight discoloration
of his extremities.

00:06:50,738 --> 00:06:53,734
Lividity is just setting in.

00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:57,211
The Irwins were killed
less than an hour ago.

00:06:57,211 --> 00:06:59,380
Can't tell if
he was stabbed, too.

00:07:01,682 --> 00:07:03,150
Nasty head wound, though.

00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,620
Possible broken nose, too.

00:07:07,255 --> 00:07:09,123
So, Mr. Irwin was probably
getting ready to go to work.

00:07:09,123 --> 00:07:11,592
He works the 7:00 a.m. shift at
the gas station at the corner.

00:07:11,592 --> 00:07:14,395
Looks like Mrs. Irwin
was making him breakfast.

00:07:14,395 --> 00:07:16,739
An omelette.
Maybe a frittata.

00:07:16,739 --> 00:07:18,299
BRASS:
Oh, how Continental. Lucky guy.

00:07:18,299 --> 00:07:21,402
Check out
the family photo.

00:07:21,402 --> 00:07:23,741
Matching outfits.

00:07:23,741 --> 00:07:25,733
There is something
very wrong with that.

00:07:25,733 --> 00:07:27,740
What? That is a
nice family photo.

00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,243
SANDERS:
Still wrong.

00:07:29,243 --> 00:07:30,645
I don't see the cat.

00:07:30,645 --> 00:07:33,740
Probably took off.

00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,484
Okay, so the killer
came through the window

00:07:36,484 --> 00:07:38,452
and surprised Mrs. Irwin, right?

00:07:47,628 --> 00:07:51,299
SANDERS:
<i>Killer hears the husband</i>
<i>getting out of the shower.</i>

00:07:51,299 --> 00:07:52,740
<i>Goes to take care of him.</i>

00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:01,676
Hey, uh, guys?

00:08:01,676 --> 00:08:04,679
Cash and credit cards
are still here.

00:08:04,679 --> 00:08:06,314
You know, come to think of it,

00:08:06,314 --> 00:08:08,049
parrots like these are
worth thousands of dollars.

00:08:08,049 --> 00:08:10,051
More, if they can talk.

00:08:10,741 --> 00:08:12,653
I don't think this is a robbery.

00:08:12,653 --> 00:08:13,739
BRASS:
Well, maybe they were targeted.

00:08:13,739 --> 00:08:15,323
I'll go talk to the landlord.

00:08:15,323 --> 00:08:18,392
See if anybody had
a problem with the Irwins.

00:08:18,392 --> 00:08:20,695
Hey, David.
Hey.

00:08:20,695 --> 00:08:23,264
I am so sorry I'm late.
It's been one of those days.

00:08:23,264 --> 00:08:25,533
They're not going
anywhere.

00:08:27,501 --> 00:08:29,503
(sighs)

00:08:29,503 --> 00:08:32,573
What is the deal
with glass tables today?

00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:08,738
The print on the balcony door
belongs to Malone.

00:09:10,734 --> 00:09:12,740
There's only one set
of shoe prints out here.

00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:15,616
Size 10, same size
as Mr. Malone.

00:09:15,616 --> 00:09:17,051
If he was pushed
from this balcony,

00:09:17,051 --> 00:09:18,733
there'd be evidence
of his attacker out here

00:09:18,733 --> 00:09:20,154
and there doesn't
appear to be any.

00:09:20,154 --> 00:09:23,739
Maybe he was pushed
from somewhere else?

00:09:33,033 --> 00:09:35,369
Look where the body landed.

00:09:35,369 --> 00:09:37,733
LANGSTON: The body's not
directly below this balcony.

00:09:37,733 --> 00:09:39,373
It's under
the one next door.

00:09:42,643 --> 00:09:43,742
Suite next door
is registered to

00:09:43,742 --> 00:09:46,113
a Stacy Cano and a Dana
Carlston, from Ohio.

00:09:46,113 --> 00:09:48,182
No connection to
the victim that we know of.

00:09:54,255 --> 00:09:56,257
Drop of blood.

00:10:00,227 --> 00:10:01,737
LVPD! Open up!

00:10:14,733 --> 00:10:16,544
NICK (quietly):
Got a blood trail.

00:10:22,082 --> 00:10:23,350
Hey...

00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:51,736
(gasps, screams)

00:11:03,591 --> 00:11:05,092
(retching, coughing)

00:11:05,092 --> 00:11:09,163
STOKES:
Here you go.
Drink this.

00:11:09,163 --> 00:11:10,631
Thank you.

00:11:10,631 --> 00:11:12,266
You've got some
minor bruising,

00:11:12,266 --> 00:11:13,734
but no open wounds.

00:11:13,734 --> 00:11:17,605
And it appears that the blood
that you were both covered in

00:11:17,605 --> 00:11:19,540
doesn't belong
to either of you.

00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,542
Who does it belong
to then?

00:11:21,542 --> 00:11:24,478
We were hoping
you could tell us.

00:11:24,478 --> 00:11:26,647
Do you recognize this man?

00:11:29,734 --> 00:11:32,553
No, I don't think so.

00:11:32,553 --> 00:11:35,222
We think he might have been
in your hotel room last night.

00:11:37,191 --> 00:11:38,592
You don't remember?

00:11:38,592 --> 00:11:41,741
We had a lot to drink.

00:11:41,741 --> 00:11:44,198
Everything's
a little hazy.

00:11:44,198 --> 00:11:46,333
Do you think that
this is his blood?

00:11:48,168 --> 00:11:49,537
(groans)

00:11:49,537 --> 00:11:50,734
What happened to him?

00:11:50,734 --> 00:11:52,673
He's dead.

00:11:52,673 --> 00:11:54,542
Oh, my God.

00:11:54,542 --> 00:11:57,378
I'm gonna be sick again.

00:11:57,378 --> 00:11:59,413
(retching)

00:11:59,413 --> 00:12:03,484
An officer's going to come
by and take you both to the
hospital, get you checked out.

00:12:03,484 --> 00:12:06,220
But we're still going
to need to ask you
some more questions.

00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,621
Okay?

00:12:07,621 --> 00:12:10,291
(muffled):
Okay.

00:12:13,227 --> 00:12:14,740
The victim suffered
a fractured skull

00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:17,598
and intercranial bleed.

00:12:17,598 --> 00:12:19,099
Rendered him unconscious.

00:12:19,099 --> 00:12:20,739
So the killer attacked
him in the shower

00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:22,603
and smashed his head
against the wall.

00:12:22,603 --> 00:12:23,734
And he drowned.

00:12:23,734 --> 00:12:24,740
Drowned?!

00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,474
We didn't find any
water in the tub.

00:12:27,474 --> 00:12:31,145
You know, it's possible
to drown in an inch of water.

00:12:31,145 --> 00:12:33,740
Victim was unconscious.
Couldn't lift his head up.

00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:36,617
Drain was clogged.
Water built up.

00:12:36,617 --> 00:12:38,552
By the time you arrived,
the water was gone.

00:12:39,733 --> 00:12:41,055
But I found something else.

00:12:41,055 --> 00:12:42,656
Healed scars

00:12:42,656 --> 00:12:44,391
on his upper body.

00:12:44,391 --> 00:12:46,735
Could be from some
past altercation.

00:12:46,735 --> 00:12:49,396
Guess Mr. Irwin
had some enemies.

00:12:51,265 --> 00:12:53,734

You left that message

00:12:53,734 --> 00:12:55,202

00:12:55,202 --> 00:12:56,604
How do you know it was me?

00:12:56,604 --> 00:12:58,238
How do I know
it was you?

00:12:58,238 --> 00:13:00,074
You called from
your home phone.

00:13:00,074 --> 00:13:02,733
Yeah, that doesn't
prove I made the call.

00:13:02,733 --> 00:13:03,735
Dude, it's your voice.

00:13:03,735 --> 00:13:05,446
All right,
look, Dwayne,

00:13:05,446 --> 00:13:07,147
you live next door
to the Irwins.

00:13:07,147 --> 00:13:09,249
Your landlord says you
threatened him several times.

00:13:09,249 --> 00:13:11,385
You tried
to get him evicted, right?

00:13:11,385 --> 00:13:12,735
Yeah, I hated him
all right,

00:13:12,735 --> 00:13:14,254
but I didn't kill him.

00:13:14,254 --> 00:13:17,057

that bird, though.

00:13:17,057 --> 00:13:19,733

You mean you threatened
to kill your neighbors

00:13:22,396 --> 00:13:23,738
because the bird was
making too much noise?

00:13:23,738 --> 00:13:24,742
Wasn't just the bird.

00:13:24,742 --> 00:13:26,737
The Irwins were arguing
all the time.

00:13:26,737 --> 00:13:28,737
Screaming, throwing things.

No, they wanted

00:21:24,077 --> 00:21:25,737
in the women's
hotel room.

00:21:25,737 --> 00:21:29,739
Parallel linear scrapes
with parabolic edges.

00:21:29,739 --> 00:21:32,619
Fingernail marks.

00:21:32,619 --> 00:21:34,735
Well, maybe Mr. Malone got
a little too aggressive

00:21:34,735 --> 00:21:36,123
with the second woman.

00:21:36,123 --> 00:21:37,691
Didn't want to use a condom.

00:21:37,691 --> 00:21:39,739
She struck him in the back
of the head with the iron.

00:21:39,739 --> 00:21:41,428
That didn't stop him.

00:21:41,428 --> 00:21:43,497
So maybe one of them
or both of them

00:21:43,497 --> 00:21:44,739
pushed him off the balcony.

00:21:44,739 --> 00:21:48,602
In my fantasies, a three-way
never ends in death.

00:21:50,337 --> 00:21:52,736
STOKES:
This sheet...

00:21:52,736 --> 00:21:56,741
Brad Malone's pants
and the iron.

00:21:56,741 --> 00:21:59,734
All this blood came
from the same person.

00:21:59,734 --> 00:22:00,742
Brad Malone.

00:22:00,742 --> 00:22:02,616
Nope. Unknown male.

00:22:03,741 --> 00:22:06,520
You're saying there
was a second man in the room?

00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,742
I'm saying that three-way
was a four-way.

00:22:11,057 --> 00:22:12,325
Oh.

00:22:18,298 --> 00:22:19,737
What is he
still doing here?

00:22:19,737 --> 00:22:21,434
What happened to
Animal Control?

00:22:21,434 --> 00:22:23,370
SANDERS: They must
have forgotten about him.

00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:25,539
We should bring him
back to the lab, hmm?

00:22:25,539 --> 00:22:26,738
(chuckles)

00:22:26,738 --> 00:22:28,308
You hungry, buddy?

00:22:29,738 --> 00:22:32,546
What's the point of having
a parrot if he doesn't talk?

00:22:32,546 --> 00:22:34,214
Well, he might
be traumatized.

00:22:34,214 --> 00:22:36,149
He was living
in an abusive household.

00:22:36,149 --> 00:22:38,051
He witnessed Dad
kill Mom.

00:22:38,051 --> 00:22:39,733
Now if we could
only prove it.

00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,734
None of her blood
was in the bathroom.

00:22:41,734 --> 00:22:44,191
Doc Robbins said the tub
might have had a clogged drain.

00:22:44,191 --> 00:22:46,459
Hopefully, some of her blood
got stuck in the trap

00:22:46,459 --> 00:22:48,738
when Mr. Irwin
took a shower.

00:22:48,738 --> 00:22:50,363
Yeah, I'm on it.

00:22:50,363 --> 00:22:52,632
You know, this would
be a lot easier

00:22:52,632 --> 00:22:54,434
if you just told us
what happened.

00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:26,466
I found hair and a bunch
of feathers in the trap.

00:23:26,466 --> 00:23:28,268
Feathers?
Yeah. Guess
they didn't

00:23:28,268 --> 00:23:30,570
just dress him up,
but they gave him showers, too.

00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:32,733
Looks like blood
on the feathers.

00:23:32,733 --> 00:23:35,275
Hopefully, it belongs
to Mrs. Irwin.

00:23:35,275 --> 00:23:37,043
What are you doing?

00:23:37,043 --> 00:23:38,734
Well, these blood drops
weren't here before.

00:23:38,734 --> 00:23:41,081
Our crime scene's
been contaminated.
What?

00:23:41,081 --> 00:23:42,382
The door was sealed.

00:23:44,739 --> 00:23:47,053
They're paw prints.

00:23:47,053 --> 00:23:49,735
Guess the Cat in the Hat
came back.

00:23:49,735 --> 00:23:52,692
Or he's been hiding
here this whole time.

00:23:53,733 --> 00:23:55,742
(meowing)

00:23:58,733 --> 00:24:00,133
I found him.

00:24:00,133 --> 00:24:01,668
Well, you're evidence
now, buddy.

00:24:01,668 --> 00:24:03,270
You're coming back
to the lab, too.

00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:05,438
Come here. Come here, kitty.

00:24:05,438 --> 00:24:06,736
Come on, buddy.

00:24:07,739 --> 00:24:09,142
VARTANN:
<i>You're telling me those ladies</i>

00:24:09,142 --> 00:24:11,344
from Ohio had two
men in their room?

00:24:11,344 --> 00:24:12,733
Yeah.
Wow.

00:24:12,733 --> 00:24:14,080
One guy ends up dead,

00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,216
and the other one's blood
is all over the bedroom.

00:24:16,216 --> 00:24:17,550
That must have
been some orgy.

00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:19,319
Actually, it was more
of a one-on-one thing.

00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:20,733
She never swapped partners.

00:24:20,733 --> 00:24:23,590
We found a condom
that contained DNA profiles

00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:26,733
of the newly divorced Stacy
and the mystery man.

00:24:26,733 --> 00:24:30,630
And Dana's SAE
kit indicated

00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:33,300
that she had unprotected sex
with Brad Malone.

00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,535
And the women claim that they
don't remember any of this?

00:24:35,535 --> 00:24:37,103
Come on. Give me a break.

00:24:37,103 --> 00:24:38,734
Give<i>mea break.</i>

00:24:38,734 --> 00:24:41,739
Do you know what it's like
to wake up naked in a motel room

00:24:41,739 --> 00:24:43,677
with no memory
of how you got there?

00:24:43,677 --> 00:24:45,178
Your head is
throbbing.

00:24:45,178 --> 00:24:46,646
You're bruised,
you're sore.

00:24:46,646 --> 00:24:50,737
You've got no idea of what
you did or what was done to you.

00:24:50,737 --> 00:24:52,319
But you do?

00:24:55,737 --> 00:24:57,737
Well, yeah.

00:25:06,499 --> 00:25:09,740
A couple of
years ago, I...

00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:13,736
went with a friend to
a John Mayer concert,

00:25:13,736 --> 00:25:17,344
and someone
roofied my drink.

00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,382
What? You were...
you were raped?

00:25:22,382 --> 00:25:24,551
No, thank God.

00:25:24,551 --> 00:25:27,420
I wasn't. I...
I thought I was.

00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:30,256
But... I mean, even
worse than that,

00:25:30,256 --> 00:25:31,736
was just having no memory of it.

00:25:31,736 --> 00:25:33,739
There was just hours
of my life gone.

00:25:33,739 --> 00:25:38,264
How come you...
you never told me any of this?

00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:41,534
Not something I like
to talk about.

00:25:42,569 --> 00:25:44,671
Yeah, I'm getting used to that.

00:25:44,671 --> 00:25:46,039
(knock at door)

00:25:47,073 --> 00:25:48,740
Hey.

00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,110
Hey.

00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:51,578
Sorry to interrupt.

00:25:51,578 --> 00:25:54,581
We just got back
Dana and Stacy's tox report.

00:25:54,581 --> 00:25:56,742
Stacy's alcohol level was .32.

00:25:56,742 --> 00:25:59,619
That's the equivalent
of 13 drinks.

00:25:59,619 --> 00:26:01,740
We also found GHB
in their systems.

00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,423
So they were drugged.

00:26:03,423 --> 00:26:05,625
Yeah, it was
in their yard-longs.

00:26:05,625 --> 00:26:08,428
But here's the kicker:
Dana had trace amounts of GHB,

00:26:08,428 --> 00:26:11,164
but her blood alcohol level
was only .07.

00:26:11,164 --> 00:26:13,633
That's not even legally drunk.

00:26:13,633 --> 00:26:15,568
Look, I'm telling you,
your soccer mom Dana remembers

00:26:15,568 --> 00:26:17,736
a lot more about last night
than she's letting on.

00:26:17,736 --> 00:26:19,406
DANA:
<i>Someone drugged us?</i>

00:26:21,141 --> 00:26:22,741
Is that why
we don't remember anything?

00:26:22,741 --> 00:26:24,736
VARTANN: Well, that's
why Stacy doesn't remember,

00:26:24,736 --> 00:26:27,046
but you were only
slightly intoxicated.

00:26:27,046 --> 00:26:28,735
Not enough to
cause memory loss.

00:26:28,735 --> 00:26:31,739
Dana, you need
to tell us the truth.

00:26:31,739 --> 00:26:33,086
We know that
Brad Malone wasn't

00:26:33,086 --> 00:26:34,621
the only man
in your room last night.

00:26:34,621 --> 00:26:36,736
Who else was there?

00:26:38,733 --> 00:26:40,733
I think his name was Kyle.

00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:43,739
We never got his last name.

00:26:43,739 --> 00:26:45,265
And where did you meet
this Kyle?

00:26:45,265 --> 00:26:46,499
At a bar.

00:26:46,499 --> 00:26:48,401
I don't remember which one.

00:26:48,401 --> 00:26:49,738
And how did he end up
in your room?

00:26:49,738 --> 00:26:52,734
Stacy invited him.

00:26:52,734 --> 00:26:55,141
We emptied
the minibar.

00:26:55,141 --> 00:26:59,212
Then Stacy
wanted to dance, so...

00:26:59,212 --> 00:27:01,047
we blasted the stereo.

00:27:01,047 --> 00:27:03,616
Is that when Brad
joined the party?

00:27:03,616 --> 00:27:06,734
He knocked on our door.
He told us to keep it down.

00:27:06,734 --> 00:27:09,556
And Stacy invited him in
for a drink.

00:27:09,556 --> 00:27:13,742
And then... she and Kyle
went into the bedroom.

00:27:15,528 --> 00:27:16,739
Leaving you alone with Brad.

00:27:19,399 --> 00:27:21,100
Well, we found
your vaginal fluid

00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:24,204
and Brad's semen on the sofa,
as well as the coffee table.

00:27:24,204 --> 00:27:26,506
It seems like things
got pretty crazy.

00:27:26,506 --> 00:27:28,735
It... it wasn't like that.

00:27:28,735 --> 00:27:31,144
He raped me!

00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,741
I slept with one
man my whole life.

00:27:35,741 --> 00:27:37,283
You think I'm going to have

00:27:37,283 --> 00:27:38,740
unprotected sex
with a total stranger?

00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,621
<i>I begged him to stop.</i>

00:27:41,621 --> 00:27:43,623
And because he raped you,
you pushed him off the balcony?

00:27:45,325 --> 00:27:46,738
I didn't push him.

00:27:46,738 --> 00:27:48,161
Then who did?

00:27:49,329 --> 00:27:54,667
After Brad raped me...
I went into the bedroom.

00:27:56,736 --> 00:28:00,740
And Kyle grabbed me,
and he... he pulled me down.

00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:03,733
He said it was his turn.

00:28:05,378 --> 00:28:07,280
All of a sudden,
Brad was there.

00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,215
Kyle flipped out.

00:28:09,215 --> 00:28:11,251
He... he ran at Brad.

00:28:11,251 --> 00:28:13,152
Shoved him into the other room.

00:28:13,152 --> 00:28:14,742
He-he-he just kept shoving him

00:28:14,742 --> 00:28:17,690
<i>and shoving him</i>
<i>and shoving him.</i>

00:28:19,225 --> 00:28:21,127
(screaming)

00:28:21,127 --> 00:28:23,229
So Dana was raped,
witnessed a murder,

00:28:23,229 --> 00:28:25,498
and then she goes to bed
as if nothing had happened?

00:28:25,498 --> 00:28:27,740
Kyle said, if she told anyone,
he'd come back and kill her.

00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,302
She was scared.

00:28:29,302 --> 00:28:32,105
Well, was there any evidence
of rape in her physical exam?

00:28:32,105 --> 00:28:34,374
There was bruising,
but it was inconclusive.

00:28:34,374 --> 00:28:36,109
Well, whatever happened
in that hotel room,

00:28:36,109 --> 00:28:37,739
we know our mystery man
Kyle was involved.

00:28:37,739 --> 00:28:39,579
We need to find him.

00:28:39,579 --> 00:28:42,415
David, you said you had
something you wanted to show me.

00:28:42,415 --> 00:28:44,742
Yes. This is from the bedding
in the women's motel room.

00:28:44,742 --> 00:28:47,053
Take a look.

00:28:48,187 --> 00:28:49,622
LANGSTON:
A feather?

00:28:49,622 --> 00:28:50,741
Not just
any feather.

00:28:50,741 --> 00:28:52,325
It's premium quality,

00:28:52,325 --> 00:28:54,193
hand-harvested
Hungarian goose down.

00:28:54,193 --> 00:28:55,734
Now, take a look
at this feather

00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,734
that Nick found
on the floor.

00:28:59,432 --> 00:29:01,735
LANGSTON:
It's synthetic.

00:29:01,735 --> 00:29:03,136
Made from a very
specific blend

00:29:03,136 --> 00:29:04,637
of polyester fibers.
Mmm.

00:29:04,637 --> 00:29:07,307
I managed to trace it
to a manufacturer in China.

00:29:07,307 --> 00:29:08,641
They supply
low-end pillows

00:29:08,641 --> 00:29:10,209
to several
motels in Vegas,

00:29:10,209 --> 00:29:13,479
but their biggest buyer is
a bar called the Pillow Club.

00:29:13,479 --> 00:29:15,415
Stacy and Dana said they went

00:29:15,415 --> 00:29:17,739
to a lot of clubs,
a lot of bars last night.

00:29:17,739 --> 00:29:20,286
Now, I happen to know
from personal experience

00:29:20,286 --> 00:29:22,739
that this particular
club does sell

00:29:22,739 --> 00:29:24,490
the yard-long drinks,
much like the ones

00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:26,459
that you found
in the their suite.

00:29:26,459 --> 00:29:28,561
Maybe that's
where they met Kyle.

00:29:28,561 --> 00:29:31,564
But what does a club need
with pillows?

00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,550
So, half-naked people hitting
each other with pillows.

00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:52,685
An adult
slumber party.

00:29:52,685 --> 00:29:53,739
That's kinky.

00:29:53,739 --> 00:29:55,521
Well, you're already
dressed for bed.

00:29:55,521 --> 00:29:57,657
It sends a pretty
clear message.

00:29:57,657 --> 00:29:59,659
Yeah, add alcohol to the mix.

00:29:59,659 --> 00:30:01,527
Gives you permission to
act out your aggressions.

00:30:01,527 --> 00:30:03,737
No limits, no taboos.

00:30:04,738 --> 00:30:06,132
Excuse me.

00:30:06,132 --> 00:30:07,734
What can I get you?

00:30:07,734 --> 00:30:08,738
Yeah, we're from the crime lab.

00:30:08,738 --> 00:30:10,570
We have reason
to believe

00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:12,740
that these two women were
in here drinking last night.

00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,273
Drinking a lot.

00:30:14,273 --> 00:30:15,735
You know who might
have served them?

00:30:15,735 --> 00:30:17,543
It was my night off,

00:30:17,543 --> 00:30:18,742
but check at the bar.

00:30:20,246 --> 00:30:24,050
Our bartender, Kyle,
he was working.

00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:25,451
Thanks.

00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,559
Hey.

00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:35,740
Are you Kyle?

00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:37,597
Yeah.

00:30:37,597 --> 00:30:39,465
What happened to your head?

00:30:39,465 --> 00:30:41,467
Oh, I hit it
on the edge of the bar.

00:30:41,467 --> 00:30:43,036
Say what?

00:30:43,036 --> 00:30:45,371
I said I hit it on
the edge of the...

00:30:45,371 --> 00:30:47,206
Aah! Damn!

00:30:47,206 --> 00:30:48,737
What the hell, man?

00:30:50,143 --> 00:30:51,738
Looks like you
ran into an iron.

00:30:59,052 --> 00:31:00,653
Man, girl's lying.

00:31:00,653 --> 00:31:02,088
About which part?

00:31:02,088 --> 00:31:04,524
The attempted rape
or the murder?

00:31:04,524 --> 00:31:06,225
Both.
We know
you had sex

00:31:06,225 --> 00:31:07,694
with Stacy Cano.

00:31:07,694 --> 00:31:09,462
We also found GHB
in her system.

00:31:09,462 --> 00:31:10,663
You're a bartender.

00:31:10,663 --> 00:31:12,398
Man, you had easy access.

00:31:12,398 --> 00:31:15,435
Yeah, I gave her the drugs,
but she asked for them.

00:31:15,435 --> 00:31:17,570
Said she wanted to party,
lose control.

00:31:22,735 --> 00:31:24,077
(squeals)

00:31:24,077 --> 00:31:25,178
Come on, Dana!

00:31:25,178 --> 00:31:26,738
You said that we
were going to have fun.

00:31:26,738 --> 00:31:27,742
Drink it!

00:31:27,742 --> 00:31:30,349
Whoo!

00:31:30,349 --> 00:31:32,285
KYLE:
<i>So Stacy thought we'd bring</i>
<i>the party back to her room.</i>

00:31:32,285 --> 00:31:33,736
Then, after you
had sex with her,

00:31:33,736 --> 00:31:35,621
you thought you'd just
have sex with Dana?

00:31:35,621 --> 00:31:36,737
Hey, I offered to do her,

00:31:36,737 --> 00:31:39,192
but the bitch hit me
in the head with an iron.

00:31:39,192 --> 00:31:40,326
Don't be like that, girl.

00:31:40,326 --> 00:31:42,462
Damn! Come on!

00:31:43,629 --> 00:31:45,198
Wait a minute, now.

00:31:46,632 --> 00:31:48,737
Dana is the one who hit you

00:31:48,737 --> 00:31:50,236
in the head
with the iron.

00:31:50,236 --> 00:31:52,238
Yeah. She went mental.

00:31:52,238 --> 00:31:54,240
Chased me out in the hallway,
screaming.

00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,733
Where was Brad Malone
during all this?

00:31:55,733 --> 00:31:57,110
You mean the hero
boy next door?

00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:59,245
He came out his room to see
what the hell was going on.

00:31:59,245 --> 00:32:00,741
Get out!

00:32:00,741 --> 00:32:02,736
Are you okay, miss?

00:32:02,736 --> 00:32:03,740
None of your
damn business!

00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,585
Get the hell out of here!

00:32:06,686 --> 00:32:09,455
So, you and Mr. Malone
were never

00:32:09,455 --> 00:32:11,557
in the ladies' hotel room
at the same time?

00:32:11,557 --> 00:32:13,526
I got to the elevator
to see Captain America

00:32:13,526 --> 00:32:14,739
taking Dana back to her room.

00:32:14,739 --> 00:32:16,734
Where'd you go after that?

00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:17,738
E.R.

00:32:17,738 --> 00:32:19,734
Took me four hours
to get stitched back up.

00:32:19,734 --> 00:32:21,200
You don't believe me,
call Desert Palm.

00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,402
I'll do that.

00:32:23,402 --> 00:32:24,733
ROBBINS:
C.O.D. is exsanguination

00:32:24,733 --> 00:32:25,735
due to sharp force injury.

00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:27,106
Stabbed once.

00:32:27,106 --> 00:32:28,474
Only one stab wound?

00:32:28,474 --> 00:32:29,733
You're kidding me, right?

00:32:29,733 --> 00:32:30,742
There was castoff
on the walls.

00:32:30,742 --> 00:32:32,578
I mean, her blood
was everywhere.

00:32:32,578 --> 00:32:35,081
None of the physical evidence
in this case makes any sense.

00:32:35,081 --> 00:32:36,733
Only the Irwins' prints
in their apartment.

00:32:36,733 --> 00:32:38,741
Only Mrs. Irwin's prints
were on the knife.

00:32:38,741 --> 00:32:41,120
Only Mr. Irwin's blood
was in the bathroom.

00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,421
May-may-may I interject?

00:32:42,421 --> 00:32:43,738
Please.

00:32:43,738 --> 00:32:46,459
I don't think Mr. Irwin
killed his wife,

00:32:46,459 --> 00:32:49,428
though she was the
victim of foul play.

00:32:49,428 --> 00:32:50,739
See these scalp
lacerations?

00:32:50,739 --> 00:32:52,532
SIDLE:
Yeah.

00:32:52,532 --> 00:32:54,739
These are talon marks.

00:32:54,739 --> 00:32:56,068
I heard the Irwins
had a parrot.

00:32:56,068 --> 00:32:58,404
If you are suggesting
that the bird is a suspect,

00:32:58,404 --> 00:33:01,507
he was in his cage with the door
closed when we arrived.

00:33:01,507 --> 00:33:03,509
Parrots are extremely smart.

00:33:03,509 --> 00:33:05,511
You can teach them
to do almost anything,

00:33:05,511 --> 00:33:07,741
even let themselves
in and out of their cages.

00:33:07,741 --> 00:33:09,482
Well, yeah, it's true, but...

00:33:09,482 --> 00:33:11,484
there's no way
that that bird

00:33:11,484 --> 00:33:13,736
picked up a knife
and stabbed Mrs. Irwin.

00:33:15,354 --> 00:33:17,456
Right?

00:33:22,528 --> 00:33:25,464
(cat hissing, parrot squawking)

00:33:29,135 --> 00:33:31,737
Wh-What is with this family?

00:33:31,737 --> 00:33:33,673
Even the animals
hate each other.

00:33:33,673 --> 00:33:36,342
Why didn't you just
separate them, Hodges?

00:33:38,277 --> 00:33:40,738
Even though I project an aura
of raw courage

00:33:40,738 --> 00:33:43,149
and unwavering
self-confidence,

00:33:43,149 --> 00:33:46,319
I suffer from... ornithophobia.

00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:47,653
(squawks)

00:33:47,653 --> 00:33:49,322
You're afraid of birds.

00:33:49,322 --> 00:33:51,157
Let's just say
that I was terrorized

00:33:51,157 --> 00:33:52,733
by a flock of Canadian geese

00:33:52,733 --> 00:33:54,393
while visiting my uncle
in Saskatchewan.

00:33:54,393 --> 00:33:55,561
Really?

00:33:55,561 --> 00:33:57,129
They were Canadian.

00:33:57,129 --> 00:33:58,497
I thought they were friendly.

00:33:58,497 --> 00:34:01,740
All right, well,
according to Doc Robbins,

00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,738
the parrot attacked Mrs. Irwin.

00:34:03,738 --> 00:34:06,742
We already know that the cat
ran through the crime scene,

00:34:06,742 --> 00:34:08,742
so we're gonna have
to process both of them.

00:34:08,742 --> 00:34:10,734
I'll take the cat.

00:34:10,734 --> 00:34:12,178
(squawking)

00:34:39,405 --> 00:34:40,139
(whimpers)

00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:41,736
What is that?

00:34:50,349 --> 00:34:52,084
What happened to you?

00:34:52,084 --> 00:34:53,739
SIDLE: The castoff on the walls
wasn't from the knife.

00:34:53,739 --> 00:34:54,742
It was was from the parrot.

00:34:54,742 --> 00:34:56,188
He attacked Mrs. Irwin.

00:34:56,188 --> 00:34:57,742
We found her DNA
under his talons,

00:34:57,742 --> 00:35:00,459
and we found her blood
under his feathers.

00:35:00,459 --> 00:35:02,733
<i>When he flapped his wings,</i>

00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:03,742
<i>it spattered blood on things.</i>

00:35:03,742 --> 00:35:07,736
The parrot killed Mrs. Irwin?

00:35:07,736 --> 00:35:09,602
Uh, well, he had
an accomplice, the cat.

00:35:09,602 --> 00:35:11,739
Technically, he's responsible
for Mr. Irwin's death.

00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:16,735
BRASS: So Sylvester and Tweety
whacked their owners.

00:35:16,735 --> 00:35:19,078
Think of it as a series
of unfortunate events.

00:35:19,078 --> 00:35:20,740
What do you mean, don't think
of it as a cartoon?

00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:23,734
Well, Hodges found traces
of soap on the bird,

00:35:23,734 --> 00:35:25,737
and I found feathers
in the bathtub.

00:35:25,737 --> 00:35:27,086
Mr. Irwin was giving

00:35:27,086 --> 00:35:28,742
the parrot a shower
when the cat attacked.

00:35:28,742 --> 00:35:30,734
Okay.

00:35:30,734 --> 00:35:33,059
Hodges also found plastic
from the shower curtain

00:35:33,059 --> 00:35:34,360
under the cat's claws.

00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,428
SIDLE:
In his defense,

00:35:35,428 --> 00:35:36,595
you know, I think the cat was

00:35:36,595 --> 00:35:37,596
probably going after the bird.

00:35:37,596 --> 00:35:38,739
The really hate each other.

00:35:42,268 --> 00:35:44,103
SIDLE:
<i>The bathroom door was open,</i>

00:35:44,103 --> 00:35:46,739
<i>and the cat saw</i>
<i>its opportunity.</i>

00:36:00,686 --> 00:36:02,088
Now, Mrs. Irwin

00:36:02,088 --> 00:36:03,522
was in the kitchen
making breakfast.

00:36:03,522 --> 00:36:05,191
She must have heard
the commotion.

00:36:05,191 --> 00:36:07,360
So, she went
to check it out.

00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,735
There were chopped vegetables
on the counter

00:36:08,735 --> 00:36:11,063
so the knife was already
in her hand.

00:36:11,063 --> 00:36:13,742
And you know what they say
about running with scissors.

00:36:13,742 --> 00:36:16,733
SIDLE:<i>The parrot was trying</i>
<i>to get away from the cat.</i>

00:36:16,733 --> 00:36:18,504
(cat yowling)

00:36:18,504 --> 00:36:20,737
<i>And in his frenzied state,</i>

00:36:20,737 --> 00:36:24,176
<i>he turned his aggression</i>
<i>on Mrs. Irwin.</i>

00:36:25,177 --> 00:36:26,645
The evidence
strongly suggests

00:36:26,645 --> 00:36:29,515
that Mrs. Irwin, in then trying
to get away from the bird,

00:36:29,515 --> 00:36:31,736
fell onto the coffee table.

00:36:31,736 --> 00:36:33,739
(parrot squawking)

00:36:33,739 --> 00:36:35,688
(glass shattering)

00:36:39,592 --> 00:36:41,741
She stabbed herself?
Yeah.

00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:43,735
And then the cat
went into hiding

00:36:43,735 --> 00:36:45,738
<i>and the bird went back</i>
<i>into its cage</i>

00:36:45,738 --> 00:36:48,567
<i>and shut the door.</i>

00:36:48,567 --> 00:36:52,204
Remarkably,
it all makes perfect sense.

00:36:52,204 --> 00:36:54,040
There is one thing
that we can't explain.

00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,208
Mrs. Irwin had blood
all over her hands.

00:36:56,208 --> 00:36:59,741
How did she call 911 and not
get any blood on the phone?

00:37:04,083 --> 00:37:05,738
STOKES:
Bartender's story checks out.

00:37:05,738 --> 00:37:08,220
He was in the E.R. when
Malone hit the pavement,

00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,588
so he didn't do it.

00:37:09,588 --> 00:37:10,740
Which means Dana lied.

00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:13,559
Yeah, makes you wonder
what else she's lying about.

00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:15,561
Like being raped.

00:37:15,561 --> 00:37:17,296
Well, if she
wasn't attacked,

00:37:17,296 --> 00:37:19,698
why did she push Brad
Malone off the balcony?

00:37:19,698 --> 00:37:21,300
We know that she
scratched him.

00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,735
His epithelials
were under her nails.

00:37:22,735 --> 00:37:24,103
Yeah, he's a big guy.

00:37:24,103 --> 00:37:25,438
Dana's about your size.

00:37:25,438 --> 00:37:28,240
Is it even possible for her
to push him off that balcony?

00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,608
(grunting)

00:37:29,608 --> 00:37:31,343
(Langston groans)

00:37:31,343 --> 00:37:32,678
It's possible.

00:37:33,733 --> 00:37:35,581
Check out my ass.

00:37:35,581 --> 00:37:37,736
Ray, your ass
is a work of art.

00:37:37,736 --> 00:37:40,086
But there's no paint
on the backs of your thighs.

00:37:40,086 --> 00:37:41,253
Doesn't match Malone's injuries.

00:37:41,253 --> 00:37:42,421
Well, that would mean

00:37:42,421 --> 00:37:44,156
his thighs would have
to have more contact

00:37:44,156 --> 00:37:45,624
with the rail
when he went over.

00:37:45,624 --> 00:37:47,733
The only way to replicate
those kind of injuries

00:37:47,733 --> 00:37:50,738
is if he was sitting on the
railing when he went over.

00:37:52,064 --> 00:37:53,734
Fresh coat of paint?

00:37:53,734 --> 00:37:56,736
Well, rape is all about power,

00:37:56,736 --> 00:38:00,439
but sitting on a balcony is not
a position of power, so...

00:38:00,439 --> 00:38:03,736
maybe Brad Malone
wasn't the aggressor.

00:38:03,736 --> 00:38:06,479
We know he and Dana had sex
right before he died.

00:38:06,479 --> 00:38:09,738
Did that sex
move out to the balcony?

00:38:09,738 --> 00:38:12,551
Well, we found a lot of
partials on the railing.

00:38:12,551 --> 00:38:13,738
We assume they were
fingerprints.

00:38:13,738 --> 00:38:15,054
Maybe they were
toe prints.

00:38:15,054 --> 00:38:16,555
If they were toe prints,

00:38:16,555 --> 00:38:19,458
she would have been sitting
in his lap.

00:38:19,458 --> 00:38:23,295
Have a seat, boss.

00:38:23,295 --> 00:38:25,698
Well, I'm not
getting up there.

00:38:25,698 --> 00:38:27,700
Come on, Catherine.

00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,435
Toes are under the
bottom railing there.

00:38:29,435 --> 00:38:31,742
Got it? Okay.
Yo, Ray, you're good.

00:38:31,742 --> 00:38:34,039
Ecklie's not
in the building, right?

00:38:34,039 --> 00:38:36,041
Seven stories up? Really?

00:38:36,041 --> 00:38:38,733
Isn't this a little
Cirque de Soleil?
Oh...

00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:41,213
Danger just adds
to the excitement, Nicky.

00:38:41,213 --> 00:38:42,548
Suspended Congress.

00:38:42,548 --> 00:38:44,116
What?

00:38:44,116 --> 00:38:46,519
This position is called
Suspended Congress

00:38:46,519 --> 00:38:50,122
in the Kama Sutra.

00:38:50,122 --> 00:38:52,158
What? I'm a doctor.

00:38:52,158 --> 00:38:53,392
This is my first three-way.

00:38:53,392 --> 00:38:54,393
Really?

00:38:54,393 --> 00:38:55,461
Yeah, I'm very excited.

00:38:55,461 --> 00:38:56,695
Okay.

00:38:56,695 --> 00:38:58,197
Okay, so things
are heating up.
Mm-hmm.

00:38:58,197 --> 00:38:59,598
They're really
going at it.
Mm-hmm.

00:38:59,598 --> 00:39:02,067
It wouldn't take much
for him to fall over now.
No.

00:39:03,502 --> 00:39:06,405
(moaning)

00:39:08,407 --> 00:39:09,733
(Dana screams)

00:39:12,511 --> 00:39:14,180
Yup.

00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:16,081
Paint right down the back
of your thighs.

00:39:16,081 --> 00:39:17,683
That's match
to Brad Malone's injuries.

00:39:17,683 --> 00:39:20,085
WILLOWS:
<i>Brad's death was an accident.</i>

00:39:20,085 --> 00:39:23,088
He fell off the balcony while
you were having consensual sex.

00:39:23,088 --> 00:39:26,425
You did try
to save him,

00:39:26,425 --> 00:39:28,327
which is why
he had the scratches on his arm.

00:39:30,162 --> 00:39:34,733
I have three amazing kids.

00:39:34,733 --> 00:39:37,737
My husband is the
love of my life.

00:39:37,737 --> 00:39:42,241
Not once in 15 years have I
even looked at another man.

00:39:42,241 --> 00:39:43,737
Until Brad?

00:39:43,737 --> 00:39:47,213
We had this immediate...
connection.

00:39:49,615 --> 00:39:52,740
I couldn't stop myself.

00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:55,739
I lost control,
and I'm not that person.

00:39:56,739 --> 00:39:58,357
You have to understand,

00:39:58,357 --> 00:40:02,394
my husband and I
only have sex twice a month.

00:40:02,394 --> 00:40:05,130
Lights out, under the covers.

00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:07,733
Well, you're not the first woman
to have sex with a stranger...

00:40:07,733 --> 00:40:10,169
to have cheated on her husband.

00:40:10,169 --> 00:40:13,733
A man died while I was
having sex with him.

00:40:15,733 --> 00:40:19,545
Incredible...

00:40:19,545 --> 00:40:22,181
mind-blowing sex.

00:40:22,181 --> 00:40:24,483
Dana, you're not being charged.

00:40:24,483 --> 00:40:28,220
You do have some explaining
to do to your husband.

00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:30,739
A bit of advice:

00:40:30,739 --> 00:40:34,738
The part about
the mind-blowing sex...

00:40:36,195 --> 00:40:39,698
I'd leave that part out.

00:40:56,115 --> 00:40:57,449
Hey.

00:40:57,449 --> 00:40:59,318
Case closed?

00:40:59,318 --> 00:41:01,320
Yeah.

00:41:07,736 --> 00:41:09,736
(sighs)
I know you're upset.

00:41:09,736 --> 00:41:14,633
You think I'm not being
honest with you, but...

00:41:14,633 --> 00:41:18,170
I just don't think couples need
to tell each other everything.

00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:21,407
So, who gets to draw that line?

00:41:22,735 --> 00:41:24,209
You own a piece of a casino.

00:41:24,209 --> 00:41:25,738
That's a big thing to keep
from me.

00:41:25,738 --> 00:41:28,741
But, Lou,
that's business.

00:41:28,741 --> 00:41:30,741
That has nothing
to do with us.

00:41:30,741 --> 00:41:32,151
Well, that says a lot.

00:41:33,739 --> 00:41:36,622
I-I-I've had all the
complicated relationships

00:41:36,622 --> 00:41:37,733
I could handle.

00:41:37,733 --> 00:41:38,740
This is who I am.

00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:40,326
Please don't try to change me.

00:41:40,326 --> 00:41:42,735
I promise
I won't try to change you.
So, what?

00:41:42,735 --> 00:41:45,431
Take it or leave it?

00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,169
Call me when you decide.

00:41:56,738 --> 00:41:58,738
(tapping computer keys)

00:42:04,183 --> 00:42:06,740
We found you a good home
with a nice family.

00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:09,734
No cats, and they
have another bird.

00:42:09,734 --> 00:42:11,734
This is your
last chance.

00:42:11,734 --> 00:42:14,737
You attack anyone else
and your goose is cooked.

00:42:14,737 --> 00:42:15,737
(trills)

00:42:17,363 --> 00:42:19,231
Ahh! Ow. Damn it.

00:42:19,231 --> 00:42:20,232
(screeches, trills)

00:42:20,232 --> 00:42:21,400
You okay?

00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,468
Yeah.

00:42:23,502 --> 00:42:24,536
(trills)

00:42:29,738 --> 00:42:31,510
(dial tone humming)

00:42:34,113 --> 00:42:36,742
(buttons beeping)

00:42:36,742 --> 00:42:38,183
(line ringing)

00:42:38,183 --> 00:42:39,740
OPERATOR:
911. What is your emergency?

00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:42,739
(imitates Denise Irwin):
Help me! Help me!

00:42:42,739 --> 00:42:44,223
No blood on the phone.

00:42:44,223 --> 00:42:47,126
You've been holding out on us.
