<i>Previously on CSI:

BRASS: <i>Were you two gonna</i>

00:00:09,083 --> 00:00:10,889
Hey, last time I checked,
CSI worked for <i>me.</i>

00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:13,392
You need me;
I don't need you.

00:00:13,392 --> 00:00:15,928
I give you good information.
I got you to the place.

00:00:15,928 --> 00:00:17,462
STOKES:Go back there and
see what that guy's going.

00:00:17,462 --> 00:00:19,398
(gunshots)
Clark!

00:00:19,398 --> 00:00:21,400
Come on, I'll buy you
a drink at P.J.'s.
I'll catch up to you.

00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,535
You killed Jekyll.

00:00:23,535 --> 00:00:25,737
You look like you came out
of it relatively unscathed.

00:00:25,737 --> 00:00:26,672
Good-bye, Nate.

I need emergency

Ray.

Ray, it's Catherine.

00:01:16,622 --> 00:01:18,557
It's okay.

00:01:18,557 --> 00:01:20,083
You're gonna be just fine.

00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:21,960
EMT: All right, guys, watch out.
We're coming through!

00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,596
Stay with me, Ray.

00:01:24,596 --> 00:01:26,698
Get set up.
NURSE: I've tried
paging ultrasound.

They're not responding.

Call respiratory--

I'm gonna need
to intubate him.

00:01:32,087 --> 00:01:33,088
Okay, set him here.

00:01:33,088 --> 00:01:35,941

Ray, can you hear me?

00:01:35,941 --> 00:01:37,442
NURSE:
Respiratory on the way.

00:01:37,442 --> 00:01:39,411
Can you hear me?

00:01:39,411 --> 00:01:40,092
Ray?

00:01:42,648 --> 00:01:44,416
He can wait.

00:01:45,851 --> 00:01:48,420
DOCTOR: He's seizing... Give me
five milligrams of Perced.

00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,756
Open the I.V.-- wide open.

00:01:50,756 --> 00:01:52,958
NURSE: I'm going to start
a second line,

00:01:52,958 --> 00:01:54,960
try to get some blood.

BP's 70/40.

Pulse is 140.
He's crashing.

DOCTOR:
Prep O.R.

00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:05,003
Gotta open him up,
see what's going on inside.

00:02:06,004 --> 00:02:07,773
Call X-Ray!
Got a stat chest!

00:02:10,442 --> 00:02:12,878
Ray...

00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:15,981
would you like
to pray together?

00:02:15,981 --> 00:02:17,091
Don't be ashamed.

00:02:17,091 --> 00:02:19,451
All the others did.

00:02:20,619 --> 00:02:22,091
(panting, gasping)

00:02:23,455 --> 00:02:27,025
(panting, gasping)

00:02:27,025 --> 00:02:28,090
You're gonna be
all right, Ray.

00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,628

gonna be all right.

be all right.

we're on the way right now.

move him. Here we go.

Clear, please!

00:03:24,616 --> 00:03:26,585

in the right
place, Nick,

00:03:27,953 --> 00:03:29,488
but the family,

00:03:29,488 --> 00:03:32,524
would be more comfortable
if you weren't here.

00:03:32,524 --> 00:03:34,087
Now, I've been
where you are,

00:03:34,087 --> 00:03:36,661
I know how you feel,
but sometimes

00:03:36,661 --> 00:03:38,830
the best thing is
just to walk away.

00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:41,500
Okay?

00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,083
That's the right thing.

00:03:50,092 --> 00:03:55,086
ECKLIE: Officer Franklin Clark
died a hero.

00:03:55,086 --> 00:03:57,092
He wore the badge proudly,

00:03:57,092 --> 00:04:00,087
and he saw his life
tragically cut short

00:04:00,087 --> 00:04:02,587
when he put duty
ahead of all else.

00:04:04,389 --> 00:04:08,960
He will be remembered
as a family man...

00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,629
as a friend...

00:04:10,629 --> 00:04:12,898
and all of us who knew him,

00:04:12,898 --> 00:04:15,967
who will always remember him,

00:04:15,967 --> 00:04:18,904
we stand shoulder to shoulder

00:04:18,904 --> 00:04:21,089
in honoring his memory.

00:04:24,092 --> 00:04:28,647
To Officer Clark's children,
Tarik and Brandon,

00:04:28,647 --> 00:04:31,783
we promise you today...

00:04:31,783 --> 00:04:34,419
(over radio): that we will never
let you forget

00:04:34,419 --> 00:04:37,656
what a great man your dad was.

00:04:37,656 --> 00:04:39,691
Go back there and see
what that guy's doing.

00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:44,930
ECKLIE: And as you stand
with your family...

00:04:47,799 --> 00:04:51,703
...know that we
are your family, too.

00:04:51,703 --> 00:04:53,738
You will never be alone.

00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,609
OFFICER:
Atten-hut!

00:04:57,609 --> 00:04:59,089

00:04:59,089 --> 00:05:00,979

00:05:00,979 --> 00:05:01,847
Shotgun!

00:05:01,847 --> 00:05:03,086
Fire!

00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:06,086

Fire!

00:05:06,086 --> 00:05:08,487
Quarter arms.

00:05:08,487 --> 00:05:10,655
DISPATCH (over radio):

00:05:10,655 --> 00:05:11,990

00:05:37,883 --> 00:05:40,852
("Amazing Grace" continues
in distance)

00:05:57,092 --> 00:05:59,538
(quiet, rhythmic clicking)

ECKLIE:
Yeah, three explosions, yes.

00:07:30,086 --> 00:07:33,083
Two fatalities, about, uh,

00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:35,092
a dozen injured,

00:07:35,092 --> 00:07:37,092
three critical.

00:07:38,737 --> 00:07:41,573
Well, it could have been
a lot worse.

00:07:41,573 --> 00:07:45,010
No, Mr. Mayor, I'm not trying
to minimize the situation.

00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:47,091
Look, do yourself a favor,
turn on your television.

00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:49,848
Nicky... can you hear me?

00:07:50,882 --> 00:07:53,085
Tinnitis.
(vomits)

00:07:53,085 --> 00:07:54,919
It's temporary.
So is the nausea.

00:07:54,919 --> 00:07:57,085
Normal after you get hit
with a blast wave.

00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:01,593
(loudly): I think I popped
a couple stitches.

00:08:01,593 --> 00:08:02,727
What tipped you off?

00:08:02,727 --> 00:08:04,496
What?
What tipped you off

00:08:04,496 --> 00:08:06,084
about the explosion?

00:08:06,084 --> 00:08:07,666
<i>Periplaneta Americana.</i>

00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,091
Cockroaches?
Yeah, they were

00:08:09,091 --> 00:08:10,568
all over the van--
you know,

00:08:10,568 --> 00:08:12,089
daylight's not
really their thing.

00:08:12,089 --> 00:08:13,672
I think they
were attracted

00:08:13,672 --> 00:08:15,473
to the clicking sound
of the detonators,

00:08:15,473 --> 00:08:17,091
like a mating call
or something.

00:08:17,091 --> 00:08:18,443
Hey, thank God
Okay.

00:08:18,443 --> 00:08:19,711
you're okay, Nick.

00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:21,046
Nate Haskell did this.

00:08:21,046 --> 00:08:23,086
And if he'd stayed in
prison where he belongs,

00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:25,784
I wouldn't have lost
two of my men.

00:08:25,784 --> 00:08:28,084
It's always easy to quarterback
after the fact.

00:08:28,084 --> 00:08:30,388
Bomb squad says

00:08:30,388 --> 00:08:32,424
it's all clear, it's yours.
All right, well,

00:08:32,424 --> 00:08:34,492
I'm gonna need video
from all the news teams.

00:08:34,492 --> 00:08:36,092
On the ground
and in the air.
Okay.

00:08:37,996 --> 00:08:40,090
Catch up with you later.

00:08:42,092 --> 00:08:44,703
Oh, Nicky, why are
you flanking me?

00:08:44,703 --> 00:08:46,705
You've already been
a hero today.

00:08:46,705 --> 00:08:48,089
Go to the hospital.

00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:50,608
I can't hear you.
The hospital!

00:08:50,608 --> 00:08:52,644
Not so fast.

00:08:52,644 --> 00:08:54,879
This jacket's evidence.

00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:57,816
Now, that was
my best suit.

00:08:57,816 --> 00:08:59,784
Have you seen your car?

00:09:03,988 --> 00:09:06,825
NEWSMAN:
<i>Investigators are combing</i>
<i>through the debris,</i>

00:09:06,825 --> 00:09:10,929
looking for clues that might
identify the perpetrators

00:09:10,929 --> 00:09:12,464
of this horrendous crime.

00:09:12,464 --> 00:09:13,998
No one has stepped forward

00:09:13,998 --> 00:09:15,092
to claim credit
for the bombing.

00:09:15,092 --> 00:09:17,635
Sources within LVPD admit they
have no solid lead...

00:09:17,635 --> 00:09:18,603
How you feeling, man?

00:09:18,603 --> 00:09:22,006
(sighs quietly)

00:09:22,006 --> 00:09:23,675
How's Nick?

00:09:23,675 --> 00:09:25,085
He's lucky to be alive.

00:09:26,945 --> 00:09:29,091
LANGSTON:
That's the fourth

00:09:29,091 --> 00:09:30,648
bomb dog in five minutes.

00:09:30,648 --> 00:09:31,750
Should we evacuate?

00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,089
Just a precaution.

00:09:33,089 --> 00:09:35,987
(labored breathing)

00:09:35,987 --> 00:09:38,890
You know what this
button's for, right?

00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:41,086
Morphine clouds my thinking.

00:09:41,086 --> 00:09:42,560
Okay.

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,563
You're thinking
Haskell did this?

00:09:45,563 --> 00:09:47,086
But how'd he do it?

00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,566
I mean, his mail

00:09:48,566 --> 00:09:50,802
and his phone calls are
monitored by the penitentiary.

00:09:50,802 --> 00:09:53,084
He has no contact
with other inmates.

00:09:53,084 --> 00:09:54,773
He'd have had to
have outside help.

00:09:54,773 --> 00:09:56,975
I mean, he's used
acolytes before.

00:09:58,409 --> 00:10:02,085
I need my laptop...
and my cell phone, Jim.

00:10:02,085 --> 00:10:03,648
Come on, Ray, give it a rest.

00:10:03,648 --> 00:10:05,083
Don't forget my charger.

00:10:06,084 --> 00:10:08,019
Okay.

00:10:09,587 --> 00:10:11,489
I still owe you that drink.

00:10:11,489 --> 00:10:12,791
Jim...

00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:15,760
you talk to Haskell,
you play your game, not his.

00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,629
(quietly):
Okay.

00:10:22,085 --> 00:10:25,470
Man's got an amazing attitude
for a guy who lost a kidney.

00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,091
Does he know that?
Mm-hmm.

00:10:27,091 --> 00:10:30,084
Fortunately,
God gave him two.

00:10:38,983 --> 00:10:40,752
How's Ray?

00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,657
He's gonna make
a full recovery.

00:10:45,657 --> 00:10:47,086
Thank goodness.

00:10:47,086 --> 00:10:49,794
I want Ray to live
a long, long time,

00:10:49,794 --> 00:10:53,087
so that every time he unzips
his pants to take a leak

00:10:53,087 --> 00:10:54,766
he'll think of me.

00:10:54,766 --> 00:10:56,086
Yeah, he'll
always remember

00:10:56,086 --> 00:10:58,091
what a putz you are.

00:10:58,091 --> 00:11:00,083
You know, you're
a smart guy, Nate.

00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:03,741
You've been three steps ahead of
us during this whole game.

00:11:03,741 --> 00:11:04,909
Four.

00:11:04,909 --> 00:11:06,090
Well, five.

00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:07,912
But you're here

00:11:07,912 --> 00:11:10,682
to see if I decided to go out...

00:11:10,682 --> 00:11:12,650
with a bang.

00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:14,087
Did you?

00:11:14,087 --> 00:11:16,387
What's different about you?

00:11:16,387 --> 00:11:17,722
This has been so nice.

00:11:17,722 --> 00:11:19,624
You're my first visitor.

00:11:19,624 --> 00:11:21,526
Let me guess.

00:11:21,526 --> 00:11:25,563
The blast turned over
this new kinder, gentler leaf

00:11:25,563 --> 00:11:27,732
in you.
If you don't mind,

00:11:27,732 --> 00:11:29,092
I'd like to eat my lunch.

00:11:29,092 --> 00:11:31,836
Could you untie me, please?

00:11:35,907 --> 00:11:37,086
Bon appétit.

00:11:37,086 --> 00:11:39,978
Your next meal will
be through a hole

00:11:39,978 --> 00:11:42,413
in a cell door.

00:11:42,413 --> 00:11:43,681
Take him back to Ely.

00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,889
(sighs)

00:11:50,889 --> 00:11:53,558
WOMAN:
Those, uh,

00:11:53,558 --> 00:11:55,727
prills are unexploded
ammonium nitrate

00:11:55,727 --> 00:11:57,662
from your van bomb.

00:11:57,662 --> 00:11:59,998
You know, you're lucky
only one of those barrels

00:11:59,998 --> 00:12:01,766
went off,
or we'd be scraping you up

00:12:01,766 --> 00:12:03,088
off the pavement
with a putty knife,

00:12:03,088 --> 00:12:06,083
or a spatula.
Yeah.

00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:08,089
New bomb tech, huh?

00:12:08,089 --> 00:12:09,908
You're Monahan, right?

00:12:09,908 --> 00:12:12,477
Anyone crazy enough
to wave a pistol

00:12:12,477 --> 00:12:14,712
at 100 armed cops...

00:12:14,712 --> 00:12:16,714
You can call me Kacey.

00:12:16,714 --> 00:12:18,049
Copy that.

00:12:18,049 --> 00:12:19,784
All right, the brains
of the bomb

00:12:19,784 --> 00:12:21,552
are usually
within the first 20 yards.

00:12:21,552 --> 00:12:23,085
Heavier stuff
flies farther.

00:12:23,085 --> 00:12:25,623
Detonators tend
to be light.

00:12:25,623 --> 00:12:28,626
And the brains should lead us

00:12:28,626 --> 00:12:30,862
to our big bad bomber.

00:13:11,502 --> 00:13:16,090
Bomb was designed
to maximize chaos... injuries.

00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:21,089
Well, the good news--
it's left us a lot of evidence.

00:13:48,084 --> 00:13:51,042
That looks like
brain matter.

00:13:54,512 --> 00:13:56,092
(inhales)

00:13:56,092 --> 00:13:58,616
Cell phone detonator.

00:13:58,616 --> 00:14:00,085
I haven't seen one
of these since Iraq.

00:14:00,085 --> 00:14:03,488
Does a cell phone trigger
make a clicking sound?

00:14:03,488 --> 00:14:05,083
Not usually.

00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:06,758
We have got

00:14:06,758 --> 00:14:08,826
three different bombs.

00:14:08,826 --> 00:14:11,929
Which means, there's possibly
three detonators.

00:14:11,929 --> 00:14:14,086
WILLOWS: This is a composite
image of the bomb site.

00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:15,500
GCMS identified residue

00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,088
from the casket
and tombstone bombs

00:14:17,088 --> 00:14:18,870
as smokeless gunpowder.

00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:21,706
Specifically,
Nosumi Pro Formula Four.

00:14:21,706 --> 00:14:23,092
You can buy it at any gun store.

00:14:23,092 --> 00:14:26,083
What it tells us is that
the first two bombs were

00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:28,083
low explosive devices.

00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:30,084
Low explosive. Why?

00:14:30,084 --> 00:14:32,817
Easy to acquire, easy to build.

00:14:32,817 --> 00:14:34,719
The van bomb's
a different story.

00:14:34,719 --> 00:14:36,421
It's high-explosive.

00:14:36,421 --> 00:14:38,623
ANFO--
Ammonium Nitrate, Fuel Oil.

00:14:38,623 --> 00:14:39,791
Same stuff that destroyed

00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,087
the Federal Building
in Oklahoma City.

00:14:41,087 --> 00:14:43,027
WILLOWS:
Yeah, it was the kill bomb.

00:14:43,027 --> 00:14:45,086
Well, how do we think
the bombs got there?

00:14:45,086 --> 00:14:46,464
The casket bomb
was placed

00:14:46,464 --> 00:14:48,566
with Officer Clark's body
at the funeral home.

00:14:48,566 --> 00:14:50,701
It's open 24/7.
There's no security.

00:14:50,701 --> 00:14:54,605
The Claymore was placed
in a flower arrangement,

00:14:54,605 --> 00:14:56,092
which was delivered
by a company called, uh,

00:14:56,092 --> 00:14:58,476
Bouquet Builders. Now,

00:14:58,476 --> 00:15:00,092
they reported their van stolen
two days ago.

00:15:00,092 --> 00:15:03,548
Let's go back
to the low explosive devices.

00:15:03,548 --> 00:15:04,949
First one--

00:15:04,949 --> 00:15:07,018
the casket bomb, was designed

00:15:07,018 --> 00:15:09,091
to scare, not to kill.

00:15:09,091 --> 00:15:13,024
(explosion, people screaming)

00:15:13,024 --> 00:15:16,961
LANGSTON: <i>Cops are trained</i>
<i>to take cover under fire.</i>

00:15:16,961 --> 00:15:19,092
<i>The only cover</i>
<i>was the tombstones,</i>

00:15:19,092 --> 00:15:21,466
right in the path
of the second bomb.

00:15:23,084 --> 00:15:25,086
There was only one way to go--

00:15:25,086 --> 00:15:28,089
<i>right into the path</i>
<i>of the van bomb.</i>

00:15:28,089 --> 00:15:30,041
(beeping quietly)

00:15:33,084 --> 00:15:35,086
(people screaming)

00:15:35,086 --> 00:15:37,548
Shock.

00:15:37,548 --> 00:15:39,091
Run.

00:15:39,091 --> 00:15:41,452
Kill.

00:15:41,452 --> 00:15:44,092
Bombers are unlike any other
criminals, except poisoners.

00:15:44,092 --> 00:15:47,458
They plan meticulously,
they nurse long grudges,

00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:49,085
and they retaliate
far out of proportion

00:15:49,085 --> 00:15:50,828
to any injury
they feel they've received.

00:15:50,828 --> 00:15:52,089
That sounds like Nate Haskell.

00:15:52,089 --> 00:15:55,087
Nate Haskell likes
to kill people one at a time.

00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:57,034
Yeah, he gets off
on the intimacy

00:15:57,034 --> 00:15:59,036
of inflicting pain
and slow death.

00:15:59,036 --> 00:16:00,638
He's not one for mass murder.

00:16:00,638 --> 00:16:01,939
Are you saying it
wasn't Nate Haskell?

00:16:01,939 --> 00:16:03,708
Yes.

00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:05,710
Then who the hell is it?

00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:08,412
Someone with a grudge
against cops.

00:16:22,456 --> 00:16:24,491
(groans)

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,880
(sighs)

00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,734
Go home, Nicky.

00:16:33,734 --> 00:16:34,889
You're tired.

00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:39,540
No, I'm-I'm... I'm okay.

00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,888
I mean, everybody's
tired, right?

00:16:40,888 --> 00:16:43,744
Everybody wasn't shot
and then blown up.

00:16:43,744 --> 00:16:44,881
(laughs quietly)

00:16:44,881 --> 00:16:46,480
It's not funny.

00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,482
I almost lost you.

00:16:48,482 --> 00:16:50,784
I almost lost Ray.

00:16:50,784 --> 00:16:52,882
And I don't want
to lose this case

00:16:52,882 --> 00:16:56,690
because you're
maxed out.

00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:58,525
You need to sit down with
the department shrink.

00:16:58,525 --> 00:17:01,628
Oh, come on.
It's mandatory after
a shooting incident.

00:17:01,628 --> 00:17:03,230
Yeah, I-I know the rules.

00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,885
But it's not about rules, Nicky.

00:17:04,885 --> 00:17:06,734
It's about you.

00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:09,881
Look, the time I waste
talking to a shrink is time

00:17:09,881 --> 00:17:12,473
I could be helping you out
on this case.

00:17:12,473 --> 00:17:15,409
You can't just John Wayne this
like everything else.

00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,211
(sighs)

00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:20,748
After losing Warrick,

00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:23,584
I thought, if I just

00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,586
worked hard enough,

00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:28,322
if I focused completely
on the cases

00:17:28,322 --> 00:17:30,724
that I... I wouldn't have

00:17:30,724 --> 00:17:32,883
to think about his death.

00:17:33,883 --> 00:17:36,882
There isn't

00:17:36,882 --> 00:17:38,882
enough work in the world...

00:17:42,703 --> 00:17:46,807
I realized
that I couldn't do my job

00:17:46,807 --> 00:17:49,777
without talking to somebody.

00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,779
I never knew that about you.

00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:52,885
Well, I'm...

00:17:52,885 --> 00:17:55,516
I'm good at hiding things.

00:17:55,516 --> 00:17:57,882
Like you.

00:17:57,882 --> 00:17:59,882
(sighs)

00:17:59,882 --> 00:18:03,490
Just ask yourself
this, okay?

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,883
If you got a callout tomorrow

00:18:06,883 --> 00:18:08,595
to the restaurant where

00:18:08,595 --> 00:18:11,598
you got shot and
Officer Clark died,

00:18:11,598 --> 00:18:13,885
could you focus?

00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:16,885
Could you be there
for your team?

00:18:16,885 --> 00:18:20,307
Would you want you
backing you up right now?

00:18:23,377 --> 00:18:25,379
Make that call.

00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,318
(camera shutter clicking)

00:18:39,526 --> 00:18:41,695
Officers Morales
and Hooper.

00:18:41,695 --> 00:18:43,297
Both had kids.

00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:53,707
(camera shutter clicks)

00:18:53,707 --> 00:18:56,643
This poor soul's been
through here twice.

00:18:56,643 --> 00:18:59,546
Once in the line of duty,
and then a bomb.

00:18:59,546 --> 00:19:01,248
Makes you want to slug someone.

00:19:01,248 --> 00:19:03,817
And then some.

00:19:03,817 --> 00:19:06,820
Explosive must have been
beneath his thorax.

00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:09,323
Trauma lessens
as it moves out from there.

00:19:09,323 --> 00:19:11,558
Mostly plastic and wire.
No shrapnel.

00:19:11,558 --> 00:19:14,461
Consistent
with our theory

00:19:14,461 --> 00:19:17,698
that the coffin bomb
was designed to cause panic.

00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:19,766
I can't stop thinking

00:19:19,766 --> 00:19:21,884
about his family.

00:19:21,884 --> 00:19:23,884
Losing a husband
is horrible enough

00:19:23,884 --> 00:19:26,406
without the funeral
ending up like this.

00:19:26,406 --> 00:19:28,408
I spoke to his wife.

00:19:28,408 --> 00:19:30,844
Told her he was already
in a better place.

00:19:30,844 --> 00:19:32,881
Do you believe that?

00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:36,617
I believe that
it helped her.

00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:52,566
Hmm... Maybe Officer Clark
just helped us.

00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:02,543
I may have found
the bomber's signature.

00:20:02,543 --> 00:20:04,845
You see the way
the wires are twisted

00:20:04,845 --> 00:20:06,547
and then soldered?

00:20:06,547 --> 00:20:07,886
Well, if you put a wire

00:20:07,886 --> 00:20:11,880
on a post and then twist it,
most people are happy with that.

00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,554
This guy soldered it, too.

00:20:13,554 --> 00:20:16,323
He didn't leave anything
to chance.

00:20:16,323 --> 00:20:18,592
He is meticulous.

00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,886
Maybe even OCD.

00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,764
Sounds like you admire this guy.

00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,566
(laughs)
Yeah, I admire the work.

00:20:25,566 --> 00:20:28,435
Doc Robbins just pulled
this SIM card out of

00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:29,703
Officer Clark's body.

00:20:29,703 --> 00:20:31,572
You want to bet
that's from the cell phone

00:20:31,572 --> 00:20:32,739
that detonated the casket bomb?

00:20:32,739 --> 00:20:33,882
SANDERS:
Let's plug it in,

00:20:33,882 --> 00:20:36,885
and see who reached out
and touched someone.

00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:02,502
(beeping)

00:21:02,502 --> 00:21:05,883
Hey, bomber, we got your number.

00:21:05,883 --> 00:21:08,575
So the cell number came
back to a Thomas Rand.

00:21:08,575 --> 00:21:09,810
He's a local kid.

00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,745
A Marine deployed
to Afghanistan.

00:21:11,745 --> 00:21:14,481
Says here he was
a demolition specialist,

00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:16,817
4th Engineers, 1st Marines.

00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:17,885
So the guy knows bombs.

00:21:17,885 --> 00:21:19,686
Yeah, but if you look at
the bottom of the page,

00:21:19,686 --> 00:21:21,588
he was killed in
action last month.

00:21:21,588 --> 00:21:24,880
Well, maybe a friend or relative
is looking for payback, huh?

00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,561
Well, that's just what
I'm going to ask his wife.

00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,468
Mrs. Rand.

00:21:34,468 --> 00:21:35,884
(clears throat)

00:21:35,884 --> 00:21:37,881
Hello.

00:21:37,881 --> 00:21:39,880
Thank you for coming in.

00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,375
I'm Captain
Jim Brass.

00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:46,213
Look, uh, I know your husband
was killed recently,

00:21:46,213 --> 00:21:48,881
bravely serving our
country in Afghanistan.

00:21:48,881 --> 00:21:50,384
I'm sorry for
your loss.

00:21:50,384 --> 00:21:51,886
Yeah, that's what
the Marines said

00:21:51,886 --> 00:21:53,881
when they came to the house.

00:21:53,881 --> 00:21:55,455
The insurance agent...

00:21:55,455 --> 00:21:57,591
Mrs. Rand, I know.
I... I'm a former Marine.

00:21:57,591 --> 00:21:58,759
I served in Vietnam.

00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:00,260
I saw a lot. I lost

00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,595
a lot of friends.
I understand your anger.

00:22:01,595 --> 00:22:04,531
My daughter is four,
and I have a son on the way.

00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:05,832
All right.

00:22:05,832 --> 00:22:07,467
What'd you do with your
husband's cell phone,

00:22:07,467 --> 00:22:08,468
the 0-1-0-1 number?

00:22:10,504 --> 00:22:11,805
I don't know.

00:22:11,805 --> 00:22:14,508
I-I gave most of his stuff
away to charity.

00:22:14,508 --> 00:22:15,884
Why?
Because it was used

00:22:15,884 --> 00:22:17,886
to detonate a bomb
at a funeral.

00:22:19,889 --> 00:22:21,887
Th-that policeman's funeral?

00:22:21,887 --> 00:22:23,882
The-the one that's on the news?

00:22:23,882 --> 00:22:25,385
Exactly.

00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:26,889
So, what'd you do with it?
Who'd you give it to?

00:22:26,889 --> 00:22:28,789
A-A community center.

00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:30,524
Um, it was a charity drive.

00:22:30,524 --> 00:22:31,491
They were collecting

00:22:31,491 --> 00:22:32,826
cell phones for soldiers.

00:22:32,826 --> 00:22:34,461
Which community center?

00:22:34,461 --> 00:22:37,397
MAN:
Are you ready for a new America?

00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:39,466
Where hard work pays off?

00:22:39,466 --> 00:22:40,888
(indistinct shouts, cheers)

00:22:40,888 --> 00:22:44,884
This country's been hijacked
by profiteers!

00:22:44,884 --> 00:22:46,840
Big banks, Wall Street,

00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,709
giant corporations.

00:22:48,709 --> 00:22:51,578
They have a license to steal
at our expense.

00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:53,886
(various shouts)
Their credit cards

00:22:53,886 --> 00:22:54,888
keep us in debt.

00:22:54,888 --> 00:22:56,216
That's it!

00:22:56,216 --> 00:22:57,880
Their mortgages...

00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,881
leverage the future
of our families.

00:23:00,881 --> 00:23:03,883
So what I say is,

00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:05,889
we stop playing their game.

00:23:05,889 --> 00:23:07,694
(shouts, cheers)

00:23:07,694 --> 00:23:09,463
That's right!

00:23:09,463 --> 00:23:13,367
<i>Stop paying our taxes that</i>
<i>pay for their failures.</i>

00:23:13,367 --> 00:23:15,602
Yes!
Cut up your cards!

00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:17,270
Credit, driver's license,

00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,739
Social Security.

00:23:18,739 --> 00:23:22,209
They can't control you
if they can't find you.

00:23:22,209 --> 00:23:23,710
(cheering, shouting)

00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:25,379
Sure, there are those who say,

00:23:25,379 --> 00:23:28,715
hold on there,
hold on there, Dr. Huxbee--

00:23:28,715 --> 00:23:34,885
why can't we reason
with Washington?

00:23:34,885 --> 00:23:37,357
HUXBEE: <i>...engage in</i>
<i>constructive dialogue,</i>

00:23:37,357 --> 00:23:41,882
<i>change our country</i>
<i>from inside the system?"</i>

00:23:42,887 --> 00:23:45,665
Brother Ralph Harvey
went down that road,

00:23:45,665 --> 00:23:47,267
and where is he now?

00:23:47,267 --> 00:23:48,885
He's in jail!
Brother Ralph was

00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:51,887
exercising his <i>right...</i>

00:23:51,887 --> 00:23:54,641
to drive his<i>own car...</i>

00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:56,743
down a <i>public road.</i>

00:23:56,743 --> 00:23:59,886
His crime: driving
without a license.

00:23:59,886 --> 00:24:01,883
Ralph is no criminal!

00:24:01,883 --> 00:24:03,450
He's a decent man.

00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:05,885
He took me and my brother
when we didn't have anyone.

00:24:05,885 --> 00:24:07,821
And now the government
took him away from us.

00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:09,623
And why?

00:24:09,623 --> 00:24:15,195
Because Ralph dared to live
as a new American.

00:24:15,195 --> 00:24:18,298
And you see what happens
when we speak truth to power.

00:24:18,298 --> 00:24:21,501
The profiteers send in
their mercenaries.

00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:22,436
Las Vegas Police.

00:24:22,436 --> 00:24:23,570
OFFICER:
I need everyone

00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:24,889
to get up
against the wall

00:24:24,889 --> 00:24:26,888
and let me
see your hands.

00:24:26,888 --> 00:24:30,444
Your authorities
are not good here.

00:24:30,444 --> 00:24:31,478
I'll give you authority

00:24:31,478 --> 00:24:32,882
if you don't get up
against the wall.

00:24:32,882 --> 00:24:34,884
HUXBEE: Uh, no, no resistance,
brothers and sisters.

00:24:34,884 --> 00:24:36,883
Don't play their power game.

00:24:36,883 --> 00:24:38,718
(clamoring)

00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:49,788
(labored breathing,
monitor beeping)

00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,006
Just say no, huh?

00:24:53,006 --> 00:24:55,794
Hey, you pack a real...
mean right hook.

00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:58,830
Like Gandhi,
I turn the other cheek.

00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,800
Just wasn't mine.

00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,401
Look, I been, uh...

00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:05,011
analyizing the
blast patterns.

00:25:05,011 --> 00:25:07,339
We've confirmed
one initial device,

00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:09,005
followed by two secondaries.

00:25:09,005 --> 00:25:10,508
It's all about timing.

00:25:10,508 --> 00:25:12,004
If I'm the bomber,

00:25:12,004 --> 00:25:14,006
I'm not gonna set off
those two explosions

00:25:14,006 --> 00:25:17,005
unless all of my targets
are in the kill zone, right?

00:25:17,005 --> 00:25:19,351
You think the bomber
had "eyes on."

00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:20,885
He had to be there.

00:25:20,885 --> 00:25:23,488
I've been looking for
him in the news footage.

00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:25,523
Here's what I've found.

00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:30,011
That is not Southwest.

00:25:30,011 --> 00:25:32,631
No, it's a radio-
controlled model.

00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:34,666
Here's what caught my attention.

00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:37,402
1: The casket bomb goes off.

00:25:37,402 --> 00:25:39,008
Cell phone detonated.

00:25:39,008 --> 00:25:40,905
2: The Claymore.

00:25:40,905 --> 00:25:44,309
At this point,
the plane clearly loses control.

00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:47,545
3: The van bomb goes off.
Now...

00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:49,009
a remote-controlled plane

00:25:49,009 --> 00:25:52,006
dips and crashes
almost at the same time

00:25:52,006 --> 00:25:54,452
that the last two bombs go off.

00:25:54,452 --> 00:25:56,488
They were radio-detonated.

00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:58,490
Probably by
the same controller.

00:25:58,490 --> 00:25:59,858
Probably by whoever
was flying the plane.

00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:02,861
Remote-controlled planes have
a range of about 2,500 feet.

00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:04,396
That means those
last two explosions

00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:07,732
could have been set off
from no more than a half a mile.

00:26:09,008 --> 00:26:10,902
Bomber's in the wind,

00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,437
but the plane isn't.

00:26:15,011 --> 00:26:18,010
That's it, kiddo.
Have a seat.

00:26:22,714 --> 00:26:24,013
You got a wallet on you, boss?

00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:32,791
No I.D., no credit card.

00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:34,011
Do you got anything
with your name on it?

00:26:34,011 --> 00:26:35,760
I burned 'em.

00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,495
Emancipated myself.

00:26:37,495 --> 00:26:38,930
Okay, well, congratulations,

00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,498
you're not gonna need 'em
where you're going.

00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:41,833
Now, open up.

00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:43,768
We're on the same side, sister.

00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:45,336
I love this country,

00:26:45,336 --> 00:26:47,539
revere our Constitution.

00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:50,011
But dark forces are afoot.

00:26:51,011 --> 00:26:52,911
Think about who
you really work for.

00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:55,313
I work for the people
of Clark County.

00:26:55,313 --> 00:26:56,381
Do you?

00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:58,516
Shut up.

00:26:58,516 --> 00:27:00,011
BRASS:
<i>Released?</i>

00:27:00,011 --> 00:27:01,553
Half of these dingbats
were assaulting

00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:03,006
a police officer,
including the one standing

00:27:03,006 --> 00:27:04,789
in front of you now.
Yeah, I get it Jim,

00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:07,008
but you found no weapons
or explosives on their premises.

00:27:07,008 --> 00:27:09,527
Oh, a cell phone from
their center detonated the bomb,

00:27:09,527 --> 00:27:11,009
so someone had to be involved.

00:27:11,009 --> 00:27:13,631
Where's the evidence?
Well, I don't know--
CSI's working on it.

00:27:13,631 --> 00:27:15,013
It takes time.

00:27:15,013 --> 00:27:16,801
These guys got no I.D.

00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:19,013
You let them go, they're
in the wind, it's buh-bye.

00:27:19,013 --> 00:27:23,308
All right, we can legally
hold them until we process

00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:24,709
the transitory evidence.

00:27:24,709 --> 00:27:27,008
Lab is backed up, I'm not
inclined to approve overtime,

00:27:27,008 --> 00:27:28,646
so... I can buy you
24 hours.

00:27:28,646 --> 00:27:31,006
Okay.

00:27:48,005 --> 00:27:49,567
SANDERS:
All right.

00:27:49,567 --> 00:27:51,770
I'm here.

00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:54,305
Got a perfect view
of the grave site.

00:27:54,305 --> 00:27:55,874
How far away are you?

00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:57,809
At least a football field.

00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:00,008
You're still well within range.

00:28:00,008 --> 00:28:03,681
Well, Ray, I don't see
any plane around here.

00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:05,483
Maybe he took it with him.

00:28:07,008 --> 00:28:09,013
Nobody ever looks up.

00:28:09,013 --> 00:28:11,008
Looks up what?

00:28:11,008 --> 00:28:12,957
Looks up looks up.

00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:14,959
In the sky.

00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:17,829
In "plane" sight.

00:28:34,013 --> 00:28:36,013
(whirring)

00:28:41,009 --> 00:28:43,922
You asked me if a
cell phone detonator

00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:45,623
could make a click-click.

00:28:45,623 --> 00:28:47,625
Answer: No.

00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:50,762
But a radio-controlled
detonator...

00:28:52,005 --> 00:28:53,731
(quiet, rhythmic clicking)
Are you hearing that?

00:28:53,731 --> 00:28:56,734
I switched the frequency.

00:28:56,734 --> 00:29:00,939
I found this 18 yards
from the van bomb.

00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:04,006
It's a servo switch,
just like the one

00:29:04,006 --> 00:29:05,443
that operates
this plane.

00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:06,945
See?

00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:11,583
It's clicking because
it's searching for a signal

00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:14,005
from the radio controller
and not finding one.

00:29:14,005 --> 00:29:15,820
I switched it
back to "A."

00:29:17,007 --> 00:29:19,924
(whirrs)
And we are back
in business.

00:29:22,013 --> 00:29:25,006
So some guy's innocently
flying this plane around,

00:29:25,006 --> 00:29:28,333
he flicks a switch
and... he's a bomber?

00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:41,379
(heavy sigh)

00:29:46,005 --> 00:29:48,005
Somebody please
give me some good news.

00:29:48,005 --> 00:29:49,587
That shiner'll go away
in about a week.

00:29:49,587 --> 00:29:51,890
(groans)
The last two bombs

00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:53,558
were radio-controlled,

00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:55,927
detonated by whoever was flying
that model airplane around.

00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:59,697
The better news is that
Greg got a print off of it.

00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:01,566
Came back to an Alex McCann, 21.

00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:02,767
Went through foster care.

00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:04,402
He's already in
the system for B&amp;E,

00:30:04,402 --> 00:30:06,010
couple of petties.

00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:08,005
No address, but...
WILLOWS: We got a McCann

00:30:08,005 --> 00:30:09,607
in custody--
a Jason McCann.

00:30:09,607 --> 00:30:12,010
Yeah, yeah, that was one
of the people that I processed.

00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,578
16 years old.

00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:14,879
Could be a younger brother.

00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:16,614
Certainly old enough
to be involved.

00:30:16,614 --> 00:30:18,383
STOKES: Well, the owner
of Hank's Hobby Shop

00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:20,007
said the kid that
bought that plane

00:30:20,007 --> 00:30:22,720
fit Jason's description, so...
So let me get my hooks into him.

00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,007
He's not gonna talk to you.
Okay, well,
are you gonna tell me

00:30:25,007 --> 00:30:26,007
how to do my job again?

00:30:26,007 --> 00:30:27,425
We know how well
that turned out, right?

00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:29,460
I'm gonna tell you
how not to blow this.

00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,429
In case you haven't noticed,
it's already blown.

00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:33,007
All right, let me go.
What are you
gonna do, Nick,

00:30:33,007 --> 00:30:35,011
give the kid a lollipop?

00:30:35,011 --> 00:30:36,968
It's the least I can do
for Officer Clark.

00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:38,903
I mean, I owe him
that much, don't you think?

00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:49,480
Where's your gun,
your vest, your badge?

00:30:50,548 --> 00:30:52,012
You off work or something?
Well, no,

00:30:52,012 --> 00:30:54,013
I only wear my vest
when I'm in the field,

00:30:54,013 --> 00:30:56,421
and you can't really have
your gun on in this room,

00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:58,011
and I'm not a cop,
so I don't have a badge.

00:30:58,011 --> 00:31:00,005
I just... have an I.D.

00:31:00,005 --> 00:31:01,826
You still represent
the authority.

00:31:01,826 --> 00:31:04,007
Everything I hate.

00:31:04,007 --> 00:31:06,831
Just like...
you probably hate me.

00:31:06,831 --> 00:31:11,005
No, what I hate's got
nothing to do with you, man.

00:31:11,005 --> 00:31:13,012
You know what I
really hate right now,

00:31:13,012 --> 00:31:16,441
it's kind of
eating me alive?

00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:18,609
A few days ago,

00:31:18,609 --> 00:31:21,446
a police officer lost
his life on my watch,

00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:23,348
'cause I didn't have his back.

00:31:23,348 --> 00:31:26,918
And he had a wife
and two kids.

00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:29,721
When I went to the funeral
to pay my respects,

00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:32,357
his family asked me to leave.

00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:35,927
I hated that, you know.

00:31:38,013 --> 00:31:40,498
But I got involved
in law enforcement

00:31:40,498 --> 00:31:43,009
because I want to try
and help people.

00:31:43,009 --> 00:31:45,013
And that's the only
reason I'm here, man,

00:31:45,013 --> 00:31:46,838
is trying
to help you out.

00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:49,440
Do you have
a brother named Alex?

00:31:51,007 --> 00:31:53,013
(sighs)
Hm?

00:31:53,013 --> 00:31:54,612
Well, if you really love him

00:31:54,612 --> 00:31:56,714
and you don't want
any more people to die,

00:31:56,714 --> 00:31:59,008
you need to go ahead
and tell me where he is

00:31:59,008 --> 00:32:02,012
right now.

00:32:02,012 --> 00:32:03,554
(sighs)

00:32:03,554 --> 00:32:05,423
They're gonna kill him,
aren't they?

00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:07,004
Not if I can help it.

00:32:07,004 --> 00:32:11,007
I didn't have anything to do
with the bombs, I swear.

00:32:11,007 --> 00:32:13,664
I just bought the airplane.
I believe you.

00:32:13,664 --> 00:32:16,010
But what's the deal
with your brother?

00:32:18,011 --> 00:32:22,573
When the cops arrested Ralph,
Alex snapped.

00:32:22,573 --> 00:32:24,342
Ralph was like
a father to us.

00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:27,007
He was a decent man.

00:32:27,007 --> 00:32:29,011
And the cops treated him
like a lowlife.

00:32:29,011 --> 00:32:30,882
So your brother's
waging war against

00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:32,417
the entire
Las Vegas police force

00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:35,012
because of the way
that <i>Ralph</i> was treated?
He told me

00:32:35,012 --> 00:32:37,755
he was just gonna throw
a scare in the cops.

00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:40,892
Not blow them up.
Okay, look, all you're
guilty of right now

00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:42,009
is buying a model
airplane--

00:32:42,009 --> 00:32:44,395
and that's not a crime,
last time I checked.

00:32:44,395 --> 00:32:46,798
But it is a crime
to make bombs and go around

00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,866
trying to kill people,
like your brother's doing.

00:32:48,866 --> 00:32:50,011
So you got to go ahead

00:32:50,011 --> 00:32:51,769
and tell me where
he is, Jason.
I can't.

00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:53,337
Why not?

00:32:53,337 --> 00:32:56,908
If you really want
to protect him,

00:32:56,908 --> 00:32:58,810
you've got to help me
get him into custody

00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,645
as soon as possible before
somebody else gets hurt.

00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,013
Where is he?

00:33:04,013 --> 00:33:06,784
He's got a house
in Old Henderson.

00:33:06,784 --> 00:33:08,004
Where?

00:33:08,004 --> 00:33:09,620
On Landon.
Landon.

00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,007
Good man.

00:33:11,007 --> 00:33:12,423
You better hurry.

00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:13,724
That show at the funeral
was just fireworks

00:33:13,724 --> 00:33:15,006
compared to what's coming.

00:33:20,565 --> 00:33:22,700
I don't see
anybody inside.

00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:32,810
Okay, I've got
to tell you, Nick--

00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:35,006
that is a really bad idea.

00:33:35,006 --> 00:33:37,448
Well, I appreciate you having
so much confidence in me,

00:33:37,448 --> 00:33:38,616
but ARMOR's still
20 minutes out,

00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:39,750
and according
to that kid Jason...

00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:41,009
I get it.
We don't have time.

00:33:41,009 --> 00:33:44,006
But can we just make sure
we don't blow us both up?

00:33:44,006 --> 00:33:47,007
That's a good idea, yeah.

00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:06,544
Trip wire.

00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:07,845
Seriously?
Uh-huh.

00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,485
There's no battery.

00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:16,007
Okay.

00:34:16,007 --> 00:34:17,522
We are in luck.

00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:19,009
The circuit's not powered.

00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,735
(door creaks)

00:34:37,842 --> 00:34:40,010
MONAHAN (on phone):
Ray, we're inside.

00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:58,329
Okay, we've got
nine empty bomb cases

00:34:58,329 --> 00:34:59,697
and a bowl of ice.

00:34:59,697 --> 00:35:02,767
Ice means he hasn't
been gone that long.

00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:05,336
There's some white crystals
here-- it looks like some meth.

00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:06,504
Hold on.

00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:09,005
(crackling)

00:35:09,005 --> 00:35:10,474
Kacey?

00:35:10,474 --> 00:35:11,842
MONAHAN:
We're okay.

00:35:11,842 --> 00:35:13,411
He's using TATP.

00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:15,346
Triacetone triperoxide.

00:35:15,346 --> 00:35:17,615
You pack those
pipes with it,

00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:19,584
it'll bring down a casino.

00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:21,886
Tell me more about the ice.

00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:23,012
Well, you need a serious chill

00:35:23,012 --> 00:35:25,723
to precipitate
the explosive but...

00:35:25,723 --> 00:35:28,008
looks like our boy
didn't finish the job.

00:35:28,008 --> 00:35:30,007
STOKES: Maybe this is
the reason why.

00:35:30,007 --> 00:35:32,930
Hydrochloric acid.

00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:35,013
Final mixer
in the TATP cocktail.

00:35:35,013 --> 00:35:36,334
Bottle's empty.

00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:38,007
Maybe Alex went shopping.

00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:42,506
(blipping)

00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:51,515
(alarm chirps twice)

00:35:51,515 --> 00:35:53,517
(police siren whoops)

00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:58,007
Alex McCann,
you're under arrest!

00:35:58,007 --> 00:36:01,007
Get your hands in the air,
get down on the ground.

00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:04,428
Get down on the
ground right now!

00:36:05,529 --> 00:36:08,013
Son, drop the bag
and get down!

00:36:10,012 --> 00:36:12,770
No... No, no, no!

00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:15,007
(shots firing)

00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:21,812
Nick, drop it.

00:36:21,812 --> 00:36:23,008
Nicky!
Huh?

00:36:23,008 --> 00:36:25,316
Drop it. You all right?
Yeah.

00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:27,007
You all right?
Huh? Yeah.

00:36:27,007 --> 00:36:28,486
OFFICER: Dispatch,
this is Ida three-two.

00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:30,008
We have a male
suspect down.

00:36:30,008 --> 00:36:32,008
Requesting EMS.

00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:35,008
DISPATCH (over radio):
Ida three-two, copy that.

00:36:35,008 --> 00:36:36,627
EMS has been notified.

00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:06,924
He was planning to hit PD.

00:37:06,924 --> 00:37:10,728
Well, you just saved
a lot of cops' lives.

00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,005
(sighs)

00:37:12,005 --> 00:37:14,498
Next time Brass tries
to beat you up,

00:37:14,498 --> 00:37:17,012
or you beat yourself up,
remember that.

00:37:21,706 --> 00:37:23,007
Well, the bomber's dead.

00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:25,509
That's one less wack job
running loose in the world.

00:37:25,509 --> 00:37:27,345
I call that a
good day's work.

00:37:27,345 --> 00:37:30,681
Where are we with our friends
from the community center?

00:37:30,681 --> 00:37:32,683
Well, none of them
had criminal records.

00:37:32,683 --> 00:37:34,013
Nothing ties them
to the bombing,

00:37:34,013 --> 00:37:35,619
so I let them walk.

00:37:35,619 --> 00:37:37,388
Except the younger brother.
He had prior knowledge.

00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:39,690
The D.A.'s going to
want to talk to him.

00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:52,010
I didn't wake you, did I?

00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:53,010
(chuckles)

00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:57,441
I brought you
a little something.

00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:58,576
Is it a tie?

00:38:00,012 --> 00:38:01,612
Okay.

00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:14,358
That's beautiful.
Thank you.

00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:16,660
You're going to be
out of here in a few days.

00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:18,662
It'll help you
get back on your feet.

00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:22,867
When I lost my legs,

00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:25,770
I had to let go
of some dreams.

00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:30,307
I was never going
to be Fred Astaire.

00:38:30,307 --> 00:38:32,009
Lost a little off my jump shot.

00:38:32,009 --> 00:38:34,008
But I still dance

00:38:34,008 --> 00:38:37,013
with my wife
and shoot hoops once a week.

00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:41,719
I'm never going
to be a kidney donor.

00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:43,010
Ray...

00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:47,324
no matter how much we think
we can control in life,

00:38:47,324 --> 00:38:50,361
there's always going
to be this much

00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:52,329
we have
no control over.

00:38:52,329 --> 00:38:55,566
When you accept that,
you can move on.

00:39:12,349 --> 00:39:14,351
(sighs)

00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:29,867
(phone beeps on)

00:39:34,438 --> 00:39:36,012
I thought
you went home.

00:39:36,012 --> 00:39:37,508
Oh, I'm trying.

00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:41,012
I'm too tired.

00:39:41,012 --> 00:39:44,381
(cell phone rings)

00:39:44,381 --> 00:39:45,916
Where are we headed?

00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:48,011
You're going home.

00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:49,620
I'll take Greg.

00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:51,622
(phone beeps off)

00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:09,012
Hey.
Hi.

00:40:09,012 --> 00:40:10,441
Where we headed, Andy?

00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:13,377
Uh, just, uh,
follow your noses.

00:40:15,379 --> 00:40:18,006
SANDERS: Phew!
Akers wasn't kidding.

00:40:18,006 --> 00:40:21,009
I smell urine,
alcohol...

00:40:21,009 --> 00:40:23,521
No decomp, though.
This is recent.

00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:27,658
Caucasian male, between
30 and 50 years old.

00:40:27,658 --> 00:40:29,326
It's hard to tell with
these homeless guys.

00:40:29,326 --> 00:40:32,006
Somebody called it in
about, uh, 20 minutes ago.

00:40:34,398 --> 00:40:35,766
You need some sleep, Lou.

00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:37,868
Don't we all?

00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:41,639
Blunt force trauma.

00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:44,308
Looks like
somebody dragged him.

00:40:44,308 --> 00:40:47,010
There's a pup tent and some
old bottles back there.

00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:48,579
He might have been squatting.

00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:49,780
Why don't you guys
take the blood trail?

00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,782
I'll take
Mr. Aromatic.

00:40:55,319 --> 00:40:59,007
Every so often, a trash run?
Kind of refreshing.

00:40:59,007 --> 00:41:01,013
That's the spirit, David.

00:41:13,006 --> 00:41:15,372
SANDERS:
Spatter.

00:41:15,372 --> 00:41:16,941
Looks like
we found our primary.

00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:18,009
There's the tent.

00:41:18,009 --> 00:41:20,011
(flashlight switch clicking)

00:41:20,011 --> 00:41:21,779
Damn.

00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:24,949
Do you have any
extra batteries?

00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:29,386
Why kill a guy and drag him into
the middle of an empty room?

00:41:42,008 --> 00:41:44,635
Thanks.

00:41:48,572 --> 00:41:49,907
David, wait.

00:41:53,013 --> 00:41:56,012
Lou! Greg!
Don't touch anything!

00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:05,856
We're okay.

00:42:07,013 --> 00:42:09,005
Thanks.

00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:21,785
It isn't over.
