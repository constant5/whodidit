00:00:10,582 --> 00:00:12,548
ANDREWS:
Oh, wow.

00:00:12,615 --> 00:00:14,348
What?
No. I...

00:00:14,415 --> 00:00:15,748
I don't even want to say it.

00:00:15,815 --> 00:00:17,048
I don't want to jinx it.

00:00:17,115 --> 00:00:18,348
What are you talking about?

00:00:21,948 --> 00:00:24,248
You guys playing
freeze tag again?

00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:28,515
Henry seems to be having a,
uh, <i>Beautiful Mind--moment here.</i>

00:00:30,748 --> 00:00:32,315
(imitates engine revving)

00:00:36,782 --> 00:00:38,282
The cycle.

00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:41,082
Yeah, I just closed a homicide,

00:00:41,148 --> 00:00:43,548
and I think Ray closed an
accidental about an hour ago.

00:00:43,615 --> 00:00:45,648
And I logged
a suicide.
STOKES:
Well, there you go--

00:00:45,715 --> 00:00:48,082
homicide, suicide,
accidental. Gentlemen...

00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:50,215
we here on grave shift,

00:00:50,282 --> 00:00:53,748
are one natural death away
from hitting for the cycle.

00:00:53,815 --> 00:00:55,448
I can't believe you;
you said it.

00:00:56,548 --> 00:00:57,682
So, what's your problem?

00:00:57,748 --> 00:00:59,148
A guy's pitching
a perfect game,

00:00:59,215 --> 00:01:01,482
you don't <i>say--
he's pitching a perfect game.</i>

00:01:01,548 --> 00:01:03,555
Do you know how long it's been
since grave hit a cycle?

00:01:03,622 --> 00:01:05,222
Four years,
seven months, 13 days,

00:01:05,288 --> 00:01:08,155
two hours and ten minutes.

00:01:08,222 --> 00:01:11,555
Henry, we're men of science,
not men of superstition.

00:01:11,622 --> 00:01:14,022
HODGES:
Oh, my band of brothers,

00:01:14,088 --> 00:01:15,688
we will hit the cycle--
of this I am certain.

00:01:15,755 --> 00:01:19,822
I am so certain
that I propose a little action.

00:01:19,888 --> 00:01:21,355
A little action, huh?

00:01:21,422 --> 00:01:22,588
Yeah. Let's do it.
A wager to see

00:01:22,655 --> 00:01:24,655
which CSI brings in the natural,

00:01:24,722 --> 00:01:27,055
and thereby brings
the cycle home.

00:01:27,122 --> 00:01:28,455
It's luck of the draw.

00:01:28,522 --> 00:01:29,755
You can't predict
who's going to pull a natural.

00:01:29,822 --> 00:01:31,322
It's a numbers game--
the more cases you get,

00:01:31,388 --> 00:01:32,555
the more chances
you have to win.

00:01:32,622 --> 00:01:35,788
And, uh, I'm on a roll,
right now, boys.

00:01:35,855 --> 00:01:36,822
I wouldn't bet against me.

00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:38,588
Or me.
I got a body, right now,

00:01:38,655 --> 00:01:41,022
in autopsy, that's looking
pretty au naturel.

00:01:41,088 --> 00:01:42,688
HODGES:
I got a hundred bucks on Nick.

00:01:42,755 --> 00:01:45,755
And it's not because
you are the co-shift supervisor.

00:01:45,822 --> 00:01:47,655
Thank you. I am also...

00:01:47,722 --> 00:01:49,922
in on me for $100.
You know what?

00:01:49,988 --> 00:01:51,988
Uh, make it $200.

00:01:52,055 --> 00:01:52,988
Like a man...

00:01:53,055 --> 00:01:55,488
All right, I'm in.

00:01:55,555 --> 00:01:57,888
Yeah, and Hodges,
let Henry be the bank.

00:01:57,955 --> 00:02:01,122
What, you don't trust me
with our future earnings?

00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:02,862
(wry laugh)
Come on.

00:02:02,928 --> 00:02:04,362
ANDREWS:
This is so wrong.

00:02:04,428 --> 00:02:06,195
You don't just shove dollar
bills into the Holy Grail,

00:02:06,262 --> 00:02:08,662
like she's some...
(whispers): you know.

00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:10,462
That's true, Henry.

00:02:11,362 --> 00:02:13,362
But this is Vegas.

00:02:13,428 --> 00:02:16,195
Uh, we have a cycle
going on, people!

00:02:16,262 --> 00:02:17,462
Anybody else want in?

00:02:17,528 --> 00:02:18,828
Go see Henry.

00:02:18,895 --> 00:02:19,895
Easy money, Sanders.

00:02:19,962 --> 00:02:21,528
It's like picking it up
off the ground.

00:02:21,595 --> 00:02:22,662
Yeah, well, don't
hurt yourself.

00:02:22,728 --> 00:02:24,528
ANDREWS:
Oh, come on!

00:02:24,595 --> 00:02:26,995
No... Seriously?

ROBBINS:
Abdomen is distended.

00:03:03,902 --> 00:03:05,235
Hard to the touch.

00:03:05,302 --> 00:03:06,868
She's not pregnant.

00:03:06,935 --> 00:03:08,435
Tumor, maybe?

00:03:08,502 --> 00:03:10,235
That would be
a natural.

00:03:10,302 --> 00:03:12,068
Maybe the chick's just fat.

00:03:12,135 --> 00:03:15,668
Stuffing her face
with Twinkies and chalupas.

00:03:15,735 --> 00:03:17,602
Wouldn't be the first.
You'll have to
excuse Kevin,

00:03:17,668 --> 00:03:19,868
my new assistant--
transfer from L.A.

00:03:19,935 --> 00:03:22,235
Just used to
hotter-looking corpses, Doc.

00:03:24,668 --> 00:03:26,502
KEVIN:
Ah, that's gross.
It's pus, Kevin. Beaker.

00:03:26,568 --> 00:03:27,768
That is a lot of pus.

00:03:27,835 --> 00:03:30,568
And one serious
infection.

00:03:30,635 --> 00:03:33,002
Question is, what caused it?

00:03:33,068 --> 00:03:34,302
Infection.

00:03:34,368 --> 00:03:36,502
That would be
a natural, right?

00:03:36,568 --> 00:03:38,368
Would you give the cycle a rest
for a second, please?

00:03:38,435 --> 00:03:40,202
Cycle?
SANDERS:
It's, uh...

00:03:40,268 --> 00:03:43,602
when you get a homicide,
accidental, suicide,

00:03:43,668 --> 00:03:45,968
and natural death,
all in the same shift.

00:03:46,035 --> 00:03:47,335
Kind of like banging
a white chick, black chick,

00:03:47,402 --> 00:03:49,535
Mexican and Asian chick
all in one night, right?

00:03:51,568 --> 00:03:53,168
Been there. Oof.

00:03:53,235 --> 00:03:56,068
ROBBINS:
The colon appears punctured.

00:03:56,135 --> 00:03:57,335
Did you say she die at her desk?

00:03:57,402 --> 00:03:58,835
I did.

00:03:58,902 --> 00:04:02,508
People like to chew on office
supplies while they're working.

00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:03,575
Swallow them.

00:04:03,642 --> 00:04:06,342
So... paper clip.

00:04:06,408 --> 00:04:07,575
Accidents happen.

00:04:07,642 --> 00:04:09,075
Definitely not
a natural.

00:04:09,142 --> 00:04:10,075
(cell phone rings)

00:04:10,142 --> 00:04:11,508
Sorry to burst two bubbles.

00:04:11,575 --> 00:04:15,608
We have another
call out: 419.

00:04:15,675 --> 00:04:18,375
Well, where there is death,
there's hope.

00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:28,908
SIDLE:
Hey, hey.

00:04:28,975 --> 00:04:31,208
Welcome to the apocalypse.

00:04:31,275 --> 00:04:35,408
<i>Aeron's Legion.--Sweet.
Meet DV8Avenger.</i>

00:04:37,142 --> 00:04:38,742
Huh! Nice chair.

00:04:38,808 --> 00:04:40,375
BRASS: So, at 4:38 a.m.,
we got a call

00:04:40,442 --> 00:04:42,875
from LeftBrain528,
in Vancouver.

00:04:42,942 --> 00:04:45,975
He was concerned because
his buddy was AFK

00:04:46,042 --> 00:04:48,275
for the past five hours.
AFK?

00:04:48,342 --> 00:04:49,275
SANDERS: It's "away
from keyboard."

00:04:49,342 --> 00:04:51,375
It's a gamer thing.

00:04:51,442 --> 00:04:54,208
DV8's real name is Steven Pyles.

00:04:54,275 --> 00:04:55,642
Unfortunate name.

00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:56,708
You guys smell that?

00:04:56,775 --> 00:04:58,342
Check under the blanket.

00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:02,848
Um... (clears throat)

00:05:02,915 --> 00:05:04,515
Mr. Pyles is wearing a diaper.

00:05:04,582 --> 00:05:05,648
Guy's a serious gamer.

00:05:05,715 --> 00:05:08,148
No time for
bathroom breaks.

00:05:08,215 --> 00:05:09,715
Right.
Didn't want to be AFK.

00:05:09,782 --> 00:05:10,715
BRASS: Well, good luck
with this.

00:05:10,782 --> 00:05:11,715
I'm out of here.

00:05:11,782 --> 00:05:13,382
(sighs)

00:05:14,615 --> 00:05:17,448
Whoo! Sorry we're late
to the party.

00:05:17,515 --> 00:05:19,048
Grandma here was driving.

00:05:20,715 --> 00:05:22,748
Oh, God, it reeks in here.

00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,182
This isn't too good
for my hangover.

00:05:24,248 --> 00:05:26,548
Have you all met Kevin?
Yeah.

00:05:26,615 --> 00:05:28,182
Yeah, we've had
the pleasure.

00:05:33,515 --> 00:05:35,882
Possible cardiac flush.
KEVIN:
Oh, you think?

00:05:35,948 --> 00:05:39,448
Lookit: pepperoni pizza,
hot wings, French fries--

00:05:39,515 --> 00:05:40,848
I'm just gonna go out
on a limb here...

00:05:40,915 --> 00:05:43,648
and say that, uh,
Moby Dick stroked out.

00:05:44,682 --> 00:05:45,848
Congrats.

00:05:45,915 --> 00:05:47,548
Got your natural.

00:05:47,615 --> 00:05:49,582
Oh, Well, I guess we can all
go home then.

00:05:49,648 --> 00:05:50,948
I don't know how you
do things in L.A.,

00:05:51,015 --> 00:05:54,348
but in Vegas,
we wait for autopsy.

00:05:54,415 --> 00:05:56,182
Yeah, you could do that.

00:06:03,022 --> 00:06:05,755
86 degrees-- it's odd.

00:06:05,822 --> 00:06:07,922
Based on lividity,

00:06:07,988 --> 00:06:10,355
I'd say T.O.D. was
six to eight hours ago.

00:06:10,422 --> 00:06:11,455
Body temp should be
higher than that, right?

00:06:11,522 --> 00:06:12,922
More like 91 degrees.

00:06:12,988 --> 00:06:14,255
Could be the AC,

00:06:14,322 --> 00:06:15,588
or the guy just runs cold.

00:06:15,655 --> 00:06:16,888
Doesn't rule out a natural.

00:06:16,955 --> 00:06:19,855
No, but it also
doesn't rule out a homicide.

00:06:20,955 --> 00:06:23,188
I guess we should
get to work.

00:06:23,255 --> 00:06:25,422
Sucks.

00:06:33,988 --> 00:06:35,888
STOKES:
Gardener found the body.

00:06:35,955 --> 00:06:38,022
Homeowners are
on vacation in Europe.

00:06:38,088 --> 00:06:40,188
Victim was house-sitting.

00:06:40,255 --> 00:06:41,188
We got an I.D.?

00:06:41,255 --> 00:06:44,622
Yeah: Benjamin Fowler,age 39.

00:06:44,688 --> 00:06:46,588
Supposedly, the guy just
went through a divorce,

00:06:46,655 --> 00:06:49,288
and was just
crashing here.

00:06:49,822 --> 00:06:51,655
Come on.

00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:09,395
LANGSTON:
Forced entry.

00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:11,162
Yeah, looks like it.

00:07:13,195 --> 00:07:14,728
I have a shoe impression here.

00:07:14,795 --> 00:07:16,762
Herringbone pattern.

00:07:19,828 --> 00:07:22,595
Glass still in the window frame
and on the ground.

00:07:22,662 --> 00:07:26,028
Radial fracture,
right angle, rear side.

00:07:26,095 --> 00:07:29,062
This window was broken
from the outside in.

00:07:31,428 --> 00:07:33,028
(latch clacks)

00:07:33,095 --> 00:07:34,962
Dead bolt still works.

00:07:35,028 --> 00:07:37,062
So...

00:07:37,128 --> 00:07:39,495
the perp tried to kick

00:07:39,562 --> 00:07:41,228
the door open,
it wouldn't budge...

00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:42,628
So he breaks a window,

00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:44,862
reaches in and unlocks
the dead bolt.

00:07:53,195 --> 00:07:55,095
Whoo!

00:07:55,162 --> 00:07:57,162
No TV. No tunes.

00:07:57,228 --> 00:07:59,562
Somebody got
ripped off.

00:07:59,628 --> 00:08:02,702
Victim wanders into a robbery,
gets himself killed.

00:08:02,768 --> 00:08:04,202
Straight-up
robbery-homicide.

00:08:04,268 --> 00:08:05,302
Works for me.

00:08:05,368 --> 00:08:07,602
Now, where the hell
is Super Dave?

00:08:07,668 --> 00:08:09,435
Man, I want to get
this one wrapped up;

00:08:09,502 --> 00:08:11,068
get back in the game.

00:08:12,968 --> 00:08:15,135
WILLOWS:
<i>So this is DV8Avenger.</i>

00:08:15,202 --> 00:08:17,968
From what Sara said,

00:08:18,035 --> 00:08:19,802
I'm glad you got
that diaper off.

00:08:19,868 --> 00:08:22,035
I had my new
assistant do it.

00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:23,835
Kevin.
Mmm.

00:08:23,902 --> 00:08:26,102
Well, it's a perfect job
for that guy.

00:08:26,168 --> 00:08:29,235
So, uh, you got any C.O.D.
on the gamer?

00:08:29,302 --> 00:08:33,735
Well, our victim's gullet
was congested with vomitus.

00:08:33,802 --> 00:08:36,435
Undigested food.
Mmm.
What is that?

00:08:36,502 --> 00:08:38,035
Pepperoni?
With onions.

00:08:38,102 --> 00:08:40,202
Our friend's unhealthy
habits caught up to him.

00:08:40,268 --> 00:08:43,368
But it wasn't his heart
that gave out.

00:08:43,435 --> 00:08:44,368
What was it?

00:08:44,435 --> 00:08:46,535
His stomach.

00:08:46,602 --> 00:08:50,235
Our victim experienced
a violent regurgitation.

00:08:50,302 --> 00:08:54,435
Generally speaking, when someone
reacts to a choking gag-reflex,

00:08:54,502 --> 00:08:57,135
<i>undigested food
will be hurled back up</i>

00:08:57,202 --> 00:08:58,702
<i>and be expelled
through the mouth and nose.</i>

00:08:58,768 --> 00:09:00,535
<i>In this case,
that didn't happen.</i>

00:09:00,602 --> 00:09:01,975
Our victim succumbed

00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,742
to food being trapped
in the vocal folds.

00:09:03,808 --> 00:09:04,842
Asphyxiation.

00:09:04,908 --> 00:09:06,775
Kind of like what happened
with Mama Cass,

00:09:06,842 --> 00:09:09,275
and choking on
her ham sandwich.
Actually,

00:09:09,342 --> 00:09:11,742
the coroner's inquest
found Cass Elliot died

00:09:11,808 --> 00:09:15,142
from "fatty myocardial
degeneration, due to obesity."

00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:16,575
There was no obstruction.

00:09:16,642 --> 00:09:18,275
Well, at least Mama
was a natural.

00:09:18,342 --> 00:09:20,342
Ah, yes-- the cycle.

00:09:20,408 --> 00:09:22,275
How much is the pot up to now?

00:09:22,342 --> 00:09:23,408
It's a couple grand.

00:09:23,475 --> 00:09:24,575
Crazy, right?

00:09:24,642 --> 00:09:26,075
Mm. How much
you in for?

00:09:26,142 --> 00:09:27,775
$200.
On whom?

00:09:27,842 --> 00:09:30,575
Nobody. I mean, most people
die of natural causes,

00:09:30,642 --> 00:09:32,375
without suspicious circs--
we don't roll on them.

00:09:32,442 --> 00:09:33,908
So, I'm betting
that we are not

00:09:33,975 --> 00:09:35,808
going to be
hitting for the cycle.

00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,542
Well, you are a smart lady,

00:09:37,608 --> 00:09:39,742
which is why you're
probably asking,

00:09:39,808 --> 00:09:43,075
how was our victim unable
to expel the vomitus?

00:09:43,142 --> 00:09:44,508
And I have an answer.

00:09:45,642 --> 00:09:49,108
These healed contusions
along the tongue

00:09:49,175 --> 00:09:50,842
say that our victim appears

00:09:50,908 --> 00:09:52,375
to have had a history
of seizures.

00:09:52,442 --> 00:09:53,942
Seizures caused by what?

00:09:54,008 --> 00:09:55,108
I haven't had a
chance to review

00:09:55,175 --> 00:09:56,108
his medical
records yet.

00:09:56,175 --> 00:09:57,708
All I know is that a seizure

00:09:57,775 --> 00:10:00,608
would've been a major
contributor to his death.

00:10:00,675 --> 00:10:02,682
SIDLE: Guess what I found
in DV8's apartment--

00:10:02,748 --> 00:10:03,848
carbamazepine.

00:10:03,915 --> 00:10:06,282
Anticonvulsant
used to treat epilepsy.

00:10:06,348 --> 00:10:08,282
You know, I read a case

00:10:08,348 --> 00:10:10,615
about a person diagnosed
with epilepsy

00:10:10,682 --> 00:10:13,015
who suffered a seizure
while playing a video game.

00:10:13,082 --> 00:10:15,015
You think a video
game killed our vic?

00:10:15,082 --> 00:10:16,415
Preexisting condition,

00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:18,315
but death brought on
by external circumstances.

00:10:18,382 --> 00:10:20,315
You know,
I hate to say it,

00:10:20,382 --> 00:10:22,948
but the needle's tipping
from natural to accidental.

00:10:23,015 --> 00:10:24,415
So the cycle
takes a backseat,

00:10:24,482 --> 00:10:26,215
but it's still
speculation.

00:10:26,282 --> 00:10:27,682
I mean, we have
no way of knowing

00:10:27,748 --> 00:10:30,282
what happened to DV8
after he went AFK.

00:10:30,348 --> 00:10:31,382
Actually, there is.

00:10:31,448 --> 00:10:33,548
Serious gamers don't
just wear diapers,

00:10:33,615 --> 00:10:35,082
they also record their games.

00:10:35,148 --> 00:10:38,148
Like chess players,
they want to review their moves

00:10:38,215 --> 00:10:39,482
and learn from
their mistakes.

00:10:39,548 --> 00:10:41,382
We did pulls all the hard drives
from his apartment.

00:10:41,448 --> 00:10:44,415
I'll look through them,
see if I can find a recording

00:10:44,482 --> 00:10:46,715
of our victim's virtual death.

00:11:12,655 --> 00:11:16,555
♪ ♪

00:11:48,888 --> 00:11:51,188
Yo, dude, what the hell?

00:11:51,255 --> 00:11:52,788
There could be biologicals
on that gun.

00:11:52,855 --> 00:11:54,322
You just can't put it
into plastic.

00:11:54,388 --> 00:11:56,088
Yeah, I don't need a forensics
lesson there, Mr. Wizard.

00:11:56,155 --> 00:11:58,255
The serial number's etched off.
I'm going to let it air dry.

00:11:58,322 --> 00:12:01,055
I'm not putting it in the bag,
I'm putting it on the bag.

00:12:01,122 --> 00:12:02,828
Believe it or not,
I know what I'm doing.

00:12:02,895 --> 00:12:04,128
Whatever.

00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,028
Dr. Langston, I presume.

00:12:12,562 --> 00:12:14,395
You're the fella who

00:12:14,462 --> 00:12:15,862
crossed swords
with Nate Haskell.

00:12:15,928 --> 00:12:18,462
Saw you on
<i>America's Most Wanted.</i>

00:12:18,528 --> 00:12:20,162
Cool.

00:12:20,228 --> 00:12:22,662
Kevin! Gurney!

00:12:22,728 --> 00:12:24,095
Now!

00:12:24,162 --> 00:12:26,762
Kevin, do this,
Kevin, do that.

00:12:26,828 --> 00:12:30,728
I'm getting sick to my
stomach with your crap.

00:12:30,795 --> 00:12:32,162
Hey, don't...

00:12:35,828 --> 00:12:36,928
What was that?

00:12:36,995 --> 00:12:39,262
I'm sorry.
He's from L.A.

00:12:39,328 --> 00:12:40,828
That explains it.

00:12:40,895 --> 00:12:44,262
Wrists are bound,
overhand knot.

00:12:44,328 --> 00:12:46,395
LANGSTON: That cord is
from inside the house.

00:12:46,462 --> 00:12:47,695
Restraints are loose.

00:12:47,762 --> 00:12:50,028
He probably tried
to set himself free.

00:12:50,095 --> 00:12:52,162
Contusions on his face.

00:12:52,228 --> 00:12:54,162
What appears to be
a broken nose.

00:12:54,228 --> 00:12:55,695
All signs of blunt-force trauma.

00:12:55,762 --> 00:12:57,328
PHILLIPS: That's not what
killed him, though.

00:12:57,395 --> 00:13:00,095
It was a single GSW
to the back of the head.

00:13:00,162 --> 00:13:01,868
Can't find the exit wound.

00:13:01,935 --> 00:13:03,268
It's probably still holding.

00:13:03,335 --> 00:13:05,568
More than likely the bullet's
still in his head.

00:13:05,635 --> 00:13:07,202
Yeah...

00:13:10,468 --> 00:13:12,502
STOKES: No cash.
It's consistent with robbery.

00:13:12,568 --> 00:13:16,202
So Mr. Fowler
interrupts a burglary.

00:13:16,268 --> 00:13:17,502
<i>There's a struggle.</i>

00:13:17,568 --> 00:13:19,568
<i>The killer punches him,
ties him up.</i>

00:13:19,635 --> 00:13:21,002
<i>Then Fowler makes
a break for it.</i>

00:13:21,068 --> 00:13:22,935
<i>The killer follows after him,</i>

00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:24,435
<i>shoots--him
in the back of the head.</i>

00:13:26,002 --> 00:13:28,735
What do you think,
new girlfriend?

00:13:28,802 --> 00:13:34,268
Personal experience says
it's probably his ex-wife.

00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,635
He's still wearing
his wedding ring.

00:13:41,868 --> 00:13:44,135
(various indistinct voices
shouting over speakers)

00:13:44,202 --> 00:13:46,868
(gunfire blasting
over speakers)

00:13:49,168 --> 00:13:50,668
Taking a break?

00:13:50,735 --> 00:13:52,535
(taps key,
game playback stops)

00:13:52,602 --> 00:13:55,268
Reliving the last exploits
of DV8Avenger.

00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,935
Guy kept recordings
of all his games,

00:13:58,002 --> 00:14:01,002
including the final two minutes
of the last game he ever played.

00:14:01,068 --> 00:14:04,108
Now DV8 was not just
playing <i>Aeron's Legion--solo.</i>

00:14:04,175 --> 00:14:06,175
He was playing MMORPG.

00:14:06,241 --> 00:14:07,508
English?

00:14:07,575 --> 00:14:10,675
Massively multiplayer on line
role-playing game.

00:14:10,741 --> 00:14:12,241
Meaning there a lot

00:14:12,308 --> 00:14:14,375
of people playing
against him.

00:14:14,441 --> 00:14:16,241
That is a lot
of people.

00:14:16,308 --> 00:14:17,675
Well, it's <i>Aeron's Legion.</i>

00:14:17,741 --> 00:14:20,108
See, we're talking
34th century,

00:14:20,175 --> 00:14:21,875
when all of humanity has
been whittled down

00:14:21,941 --> 00:14:23,108
to a small but contentious

00:14:23,175 --> 00:14:25,075
band of warriors called
the Descendants.

00:14:25,141 --> 00:14:26,575
Mm-hmm.

00:14:26,641 --> 00:14:29,241
The point is, you've
got all these weapons,

00:14:29,308 --> 00:14:31,341
but the only one
that you don't want to use

00:14:31,408 --> 00:14:32,575
is the flash-bang.

00:14:32,641 --> 00:14:33,775
Excellent distraction,
but takes major points

00:14:33,841 --> 00:14:36,075
off your score.
Greg...

00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:38,408
All right, well, during
DV8's last game,
Uh-huh.

00:14:38,475 --> 00:14:40,208
one player
pulled a radical move

00:14:40,275 --> 00:14:41,575
and just started unloading

00:14:41,642 --> 00:14:42,808
with flash-bangs.

00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:44,175
54 in just one minute.

00:14:44,242 --> 00:14:45,375
A move like that

00:14:45,442 --> 00:14:46,942
just deducts points
from your score.

00:14:47,008 --> 00:14:48,408
You don't gain a single point.

00:14:48,475 --> 00:14:52,875
Unless the point is to give
your opponent a seizure.

00:14:52,942 --> 00:14:54,942
A type of attack
like this would do it.

00:14:55,008 --> 00:14:57,942
<i>The strobing imagery
in the game</i>

00:14:58,008 --> 00:14:59,908
<i>generated
a photosensitive reaction,</i>

00:14:59,975 --> 00:15:01,648
<i>which produced impulses</i>

00:15:01,715 --> 00:15:03,282
<i>that traveled through
the optic nerve</i>

00:15:03,348 --> 00:15:05,115
<i>and into the temporal lobe
of the brain--</i>

00:15:05,182 --> 00:15:09,482
<i>frying the circuits, triggering
an epileptic seizure.</i>

00:15:09,548 --> 00:15:10,782
Who launched the attack?

00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:17,948
NinjaAssassin.

00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:20,448
So if NinjaAssassin knew
that DV8 was epileptic,

00:15:20,515 --> 00:15:22,582
and intentionally
triggered a seizure,

00:15:22,648 --> 00:15:24,448
we're looking at
a homicide.

00:15:24,515 --> 00:15:26,448
(gunfire over speakers)

00:15:35,539 --> 00:15:38,539
Geeks and freaks,
give it up

00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:40,639
for Cyber Bowl 2011!

00:15:40,705 --> 00:15:42,472
(cheering)

00:15:42,539 --> 00:15:46,705
Aeron's Legion Semi Number One
pits two hot-wired warriors.

00:15:46,772 --> 00:15:48,705
First, Las Vegas native,

00:15:48,772 --> 00:15:50,639
and future Hall of Gamer,

00:15:50,705 --> 00:15:52,872
NinjaAssassin!

00:15:52,939 --> 00:15:55,505
(cheering, applause)

00:16:00,172 --> 00:16:01,839
(laughing)

00:16:01,905 --> 00:16:03,279
Hi-yah!

00:16:03,345 --> 00:16:04,879
Game on, gamers!

00:16:04,945 --> 00:16:06,712
Whoo! Let's do this!

00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:08,645
I think we found
our assassin.

00:16:13,112 --> 00:16:14,545
These people need
to get a life.

00:16:14,612 --> 00:16:15,945
I think you'd like
video games.

00:16:16,012 --> 00:16:17,679
You get to shoot people.

00:16:17,745 --> 00:16:20,212
BRASS: When I was their age,
I was on a real battlefield

00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,012
with a real weapon
in a real jungle.

00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:25,012
I don't need to play war
with my thumbs.

00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:26,979
And uploading from
San Juan, Puerto Rico,

00:16:27,045 --> 00:16:29,545
The rico suave of gaming,

00:16:29,612 --> 00:16:32,945
last year's rookie of
the year, Murd3er-1.

00:16:40,445 --> 00:16:42,445
SANDERS:
You know what the winner
of this takes home?

00:16:42,512 --> 00:16:43,545
100 grand.

00:16:43,612 --> 00:16:46,145
100 G's?

00:16:46,212 --> 00:16:47,845
Now I want
to shoot someone.

00:16:47,912 --> 00:16:49,845
EMCEE:
Fire up your controllers.

00:16:49,912 --> 00:16:51,712
It's game on, bitches.

00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:53,145
(bell ringing)

00:16:58,579 --> 00:17:00,679
Okay, let's go.

00:17:05,485 --> 00:17:06,985
Las Vegas police.

00:17:08,085 --> 00:17:10,019
EMCEE:
Hold on, guys.

00:17:10,085 --> 00:17:11,452
MAN IN CROWD:
Get outta here, man!

00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:14,685
Game's over... bitches.

00:17:14,752 --> 00:17:17,085
(booing)

00:17:20,752 --> 00:17:24,385
(crowd shouting angrily)

00:17:24,452 --> 00:17:27,152
Am I in some kind of trouble?

00:17:27,219 --> 00:17:29,952
This isn't about
the <i>Girls Gone Wild</i>

00:17:30,019 --> 00:17:31,552
file share, is it?

00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:37,285
You, uh, you know this guy,
Ninja?

00:17:37,352 --> 00:17:39,052
Oh, man!

00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:41,019
Who filleted DV8Avenger?

00:17:41,085 --> 00:17:43,685
No wonder he didn't
show up for the semi.

00:17:43,752 --> 00:17:45,652
Dude, put that thing away.

00:17:45,719 --> 00:17:47,085
So you can toss fake grenades
at a guy,

00:17:47,152 --> 00:17:48,652
but you can't stomach seeing
what it did to him?

00:17:48,719 --> 00:17:51,685
What are you talking about?

00:17:51,752 --> 00:17:54,052
DV8Avenger was playing
against you when he died.

00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:55,119
Virtually.

00:17:55,185 --> 00:17:56,685
I didn't actually kill him.

00:17:56,752 --> 00:17:57,819
I-I mean

00:17:57,885 --> 00:17:59,852
I have killed him

00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:01,985
on the fields of Crador.

00:18:02,052 --> 00:18:03,192
Though, admittedly,
he had the edge.

00:18:03,259 --> 00:18:04,625
BRASS:
Hey, real world.

00:18:04,692 --> 00:18:07,625
Did DV8 ever mention to you that
he had a medical condition?

00:18:07,692 --> 00:18:09,992
He had a lot of conditions.

00:18:10,059 --> 00:18:11,559
Yeah, like epilepsy.

00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:13,425
Did you know that?

00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:15,192
Kind of.

00:18:18,525 --> 00:18:22,859
2009, El Paso finals,
I saw DV8 popping pills.

00:18:22,925 --> 00:18:24,792
Figured they
were uppers.

00:18:24,859 --> 00:18:26,692
Told him I was going
to the judges...

00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:28,525
Yeah, and he told you they were
his epilepsy meds.

00:18:28,592 --> 00:18:30,725
Kind of.
BRASS:
And you kind of knew

00:18:30,792 --> 00:18:32,825
that all the flash-bangs
you threw at him

00:18:32,892 --> 00:18:34,492
would trigger a seizure.

00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:35,892
Look, I'm an athlete.
I'm a competitor.

00:18:35,959 --> 00:18:37,125
I was looking for an edge.

00:18:37,192 --> 00:18:38,525
I get it.

00:18:38,592 --> 00:18:39,892
100 grand.

00:18:39,959 --> 00:18:42,125
You can't die from a seizure.
That's a fact.

00:18:42,192 --> 00:18:44,225
I looked it up.
It's on WikiMeds.

00:18:44,292 --> 00:18:46,325
I think you're gonna
kind of need a lawyer.

00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:51,325
Hey, Doc.
I know, I know, you
want a quick C.O.D.

00:18:51,392 --> 00:18:52,959
so you can get out
of the pits

00:18:53,025 --> 00:18:54,259
and get back
into the race.

00:18:54,325 --> 00:18:55,392
It's not just me, man.

00:18:55,459 --> 00:18:57,292
I got a lot of people
riding on me.

00:18:57,359 --> 00:18:59,959
Yeah, well, for the record,
I am not among them.
Oh, yeah?

00:19:00,025 --> 00:19:01,359
Well, who'd you put
your money on, Greg?

00:19:01,425 --> 00:19:03,332
You might as well just give it
to me right now.

00:19:03,399 --> 00:19:05,232
I hold my cards

00:19:05,299 --> 00:19:07,732
close to the vest and
my cash even closer.

00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:09,632
Yeah, yeah, okay.
What's up with this guy?

00:19:09,699 --> 00:19:13,832
I found these fibers
in his chompers.

00:19:13,899 --> 00:19:15,332
They match the
restraints on his wrists.

00:19:15,399 --> 00:19:18,465
He was probably trying to undo
that knot with his teeth.

00:19:21,065 --> 00:19:22,532
Mr. Fowler's X-rays.

00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:24,532
Extensive damage

00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:26,299
to the cervical vertebrae
and the occipital bone.

00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:27,765
You see the beveling?

00:19:28,865 --> 00:19:30,665
Inside to out.

00:19:30,732 --> 00:19:33,432
So the bullet went out
the back of his head.

00:19:33,499 --> 00:19:36,032
We initially thought that
exit wound was an entry wound.

00:19:36,099 --> 00:19:39,132
The real entry wound
is in the oral pharynx.

00:19:40,365 --> 00:19:41,732
No soot around
the hole,

00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:44,299
so he was shot from
at least three feet away.
Mouth open.

00:19:44,365 --> 00:19:46,432
No!

00:19:46,499 --> 00:19:47,832
(screaming)

00:19:47,899 --> 00:19:50,132
ROBBINS:
<i>It's a penetrating wound.</i>

00:19:50,199 --> 00:19:51,599
Through and through.

00:19:51,665 --> 00:19:54,465
Okay, so the bullet's got
to be back at the house.

00:19:54,532 --> 00:19:55,865
Well, if you're lucky,

00:19:55,932 --> 00:19:58,065
you might catch a natural
on the way over.

00:19:58,132 --> 00:20:00,399
(chuckles)

00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:02,572
(chuckles)

00:20:12,805 --> 00:20:14,572
Thanks.

00:20:14,639 --> 00:20:17,905
I'm very sorry for
you loss, Mrs. Fowler.

00:20:17,972 --> 00:20:19,872
What happened to Ben?

00:20:19,939 --> 00:20:23,172
He was house-sitting
for some friends.

00:20:23,239 --> 00:20:24,672
There was a break-in.

00:20:24,739 --> 00:20:26,072
He was shot.

00:20:26,139 --> 00:20:29,072
The house in Seven Hills?
The Alexanders' place?

00:20:29,139 --> 00:20:30,272
You know them?

00:20:30,339 --> 00:20:32,972
They were friends,
before the divorce.

00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:36,405
People choose sides,
you know how that goes.

00:20:36,472 --> 00:20:39,739
Yes, I do.

00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:42,639
Tell me...

00:20:42,705 --> 00:20:44,839
when was the last
time you saw Ben?

00:20:44,905 --> 00:20:46,439
Just a couple
of days ago.

00:20:46,505 --> 00:20:48,805
He got pulled over
for DUI.

00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:50,405
He called me, I bailed him out.

00:20:50,472 --> 00:20:52,672
I took him back to the house.

00:20:52,739 --> 00:20:53,939
I got to go.

00:20:54,005 --> 00:20:55,639
I just poured you
a glass of wine.

00:20:55,705 --> 00:20:56,972
Come on, stay, please?

00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,405
I'm tired. I don't want
to do this anymore.

00:20:59,472 --> 00:21:01,712
You won't have to, I promise.

00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,279
(both gasp)
Ah, shoot!

00:21:05,345 --> 00:21:08,845
I'm sorry.
You know, what, next time,
just call somebody else.

00:21:08,912 --> 00:21:10,579
Olivia, please wait.
You're all I got.

00:21:14,145 --> 00:21:17,379
I was the last person
in the world that he could call

00:21:17,445 --> 00:21:19,945
and I turned my back on him.

00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:22,345
Sounds like he was in
a pretty dark place.

00:21:22,412 --> 00:21:24,379
He wasn't always.

00:21:24,445 --> 00:21:26,812
He lost his
contracting business.

00:21:26,879 --> 00:21:29,512
Couldn't find
another job.

00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:31,645
Started drinking, gambling.

00:21:31,712 --> 00:21:33,612
It got out of hand.

00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:38,112
I filed, he left.

00:21:38,179 --> 00:21:40,212
I thought when
the Alexanders' took him in

00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:42,079
that he'd be okay.

00:21:42,145 --> 00:21:44,345
I just wish I could
take back what I said.

00:21:44,412 --> 00:21:47,245
I never did stop loving him.

00:21:47,312 --> 00:21:49,245
(sobbing, sniffling)

00:22:06,952 --> 00:22:10,419
Why didn't you find
the bullet the first time?

00:22:10,485 --> 00:22:13,985
We thought it
was still in him.

00:22:14,052 --> 00:22:15,419
Are you questioningmy work?

00:22:15,485 --> 00:22:17,952
I've got one large
riding on you.

00:22:18,019 --> 00:22:18,952
Relax.

00:22:19,019 --> 00:22:22,119
It's got to be
in the pool.

00:22:22,185 --> 00:22:25,652
Oh, no-- I'm having
a good hair day.

00:22:28,252 --> 00:22:31,352
Well, maybe neither one
of us has to get wet.

00:22:31,419 --> 00:22:32,985
No!

00:22:53,985 --> 00:22:56,619
A little ballistics,
a little case closed,

00:22:56,685 --> 00:22:58,519
and then Team Stokes
is on the hunt

00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:00,119
for the elusive natural.

00:23:00,185 --> 00:23:02,259
Go, Stokes.

00:23:02,325 --> 00:23:04,425
A little faith, baby.

00:23:07,292 --> 00:23:09,159
Ah, here to lay down
some more action?

00:23:09,225 --> 00:23:11,859
Actually, I'm here for
my tox results.

00:23:11,925 --> 00:23:15,992
Right. Found sleeping pills
in your gamer's bloodstream--

00:23:16,059 --> 00:23:17,092
Zolpidem.

00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:18,859
High therapeutic levels.

00:23:18,925 --> 00:23:22,359
A gamer on Zolpidem?!

00:23:22,425 --> 00:23:25,025
That's like a sumo
wrestler on diet pills.

00:23:25,092 --> 00:23:26,925
Yeah. Listen,
thanks to you guys,

00:23:26,992 --> 00:23:29,159
I'm really busy here.

00:23:29,225 --> 00:23:31,459
The point is, your victim was
staring at the inside

00:23:31,525 --> 00:23:33,925
of his eyelids when those
flash-bangs were going off.

00:23:33,992 --> 00:23:35,192
So NinjaAssassin's off the hook.

00:23:35,259 --> 00:23:38,192
So, why would a hardcore gamer
pound sedatives

00:23:38,259 --> 00:23:39,859
the night before the big game?

00:23:39,925 --> 00:23:41,925
Maybe someone spiked
his joystick.

00:23:41,992 --> 00:23:43,625
Can you solve this
someplace else?

00:23:43,692 --> 00:23:47,125
What about his
stomach contents?

00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:49,459
Yeah, it just went
to the top of my stack.

00:23:49,525 --> 00:23:52,125
I'll have it in twenties.

00:23:52,192 --> 00:23:53,625
Or 20 minutes.

00:23:53,692 --> 00:23:55,425
Forget it.

00:24:22,699 --> 00:24:25,965
I just got flowers from one
of the day shift guys.

00:24:26,032 --> 00:24:27,532
Does he know
you're married?

00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:28,665
Yeah.

00:24:28,732 --> 00:24:30,465
He was wishing me luck in
the cycle.

00:24:30,532 --> 00:24:34,565
Henry found Zolpidem in
our vic's system.

00:24:34,632 --> 00:24:37,099
I'm guessing this is how
it got into there.

00:24:37,165 --> 00:24:38,965
You know, I did find
a prescription bottle

00:24:39,032 --> 00:24:40,099
for Zolpidem in the trash,

00:24:40,165 --> 00:24:41,965
but it belonged
to somebody else,

00:24:42,032 --> 00:24:43,365
and there was still
a few pills in it.

00:24:43,432 --> 00:24:44,665
You know the rules:
I couldn't collect it

00:24:44,732 --> 00:24:46,565
because there was no
direct link to the case.

00:24:46,632 --> 00:24:47,632
Did you get a pic?

00:24:47,699 --> 00:24:48,999
I did.

00:24:57,432 --> 00:24:59,665
SIDLE: (sighs)
Label got wet.

00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:04,572
But I think I can still
scan the bar code.

00:25:11,239 --> 00:25:13,839
Bottle belonged
to an Evan Ferrari.

00:25:13,905 --> 00:25:17,305
All right, well, based on DV8's
social calendar,

00:25:17,372 --> 00:25:20,639
my bet is that
Mr. Ferrari is also a gamer.

00:25:22,572 --> 00:25:24,605
(explosions, gunfire
blaring over speakers)

00:25:24,672 --> 00:25:26,772
(crowd cheering)

00:25:33,772 --> 00:25:36,939
It's like finding
a nerd in a haystack.

00:25:38,739 --> 00:25:39,805
Maybe she can help.

00:25:47,739 --> 00:25:48,972
Excuse me.

00:25:52,272 --> 00:25:53,339
I'm with the Crime Lab.

00:25:53,405 --> 00:25:55,439
Yeah, I remember you.

00:25:55,505 --> 00:25:58,205
And your sidekick,
Commander Buzz Kill.

00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:59,939
Listen, sugarbug,

00:26:00,005 --> 00:26:01,205
we're looking for
Evan Ferrari.

00:26:01,272 --> 00:26:03,112
So if you don't want
another buzz kill,

00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:04,479
just point him
out to me.

00:26:04,545 --> 00:26:06,179
(crowd cheering)

00:26:08,212 --> 00:26:09,612
The blonde.

00:26:14,345 --> 00:26:15,412
That's Evan Ferrari?

00:26:19,445 --> 00:26:21,379
Sweet ride.

00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:30,679
(sniffles)
I knew something was wrong.

00:26:30,745 --> 00:26:33,245
I kept calling him,
but no answer.

00:26:33,312 --> 00:26:36,612
But then when he didn't show up
to the semifinals...

00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:38,912
poor Stevie.

00:26:40,012 --> 00:26:42,179
Did he have
a heart attack?

00:26:43,845 --> 00:26:45,179
How well did you
know Stevie?

00:26:45,245 --> 00:26:47,645
He was my boyfriend.

00:26:47,712 --> 00:26:48,712
Really?

00:26:49,812 --> 00:26:52,245
I'm sorry for your loss.

00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:56,112
We found your Zolpidem
in his apartment.

00:26:56,179 --> 00:26:57,745
BRASS:
How many pills did you give him?

00:26:57,812 --> 00:26:59,579
What?

00:26:59,645 --> 00:27:02,152
You crushed up his pills,
spiked his drink

00:27:02,219 --> 00:27:04,685
and put him
to sleep forever.

00:27:04,752 --> 00:27:06,019
I didn't crush any pills.

00:27:06,085 --> 00:27:08,352
The only thing that I had
a crush on was Stevie.

00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:10,452
He had trouble sleeping.

00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:11,952
He was a gamer and...

00:27:12,019 --> 00:27:13,352
there was
always someone on line

00:27:13,419 --> 00:27:14,585
that was ready to thumble,

00:27:14,652 --> 00:27:16,919
and he just could
never back down,

00:27:16,985 --> 00:27:19,619
so, sometimes I would give him
sleeping pills,

00:27:19,685 --> 00:27:21,752
but never more than the
recommended dosage.

00:27:21,819 --> 00:27:23,352
I think you're lying.

00:27:23,419 --> 00:27:25,685
And I think big Stevie
got nervous

00:27:25,752 --> 00:27:28,285
when his fine Italian
sports car girlfriend

00:27:28,352 --> 00:27:31,152
was strutting her stuff for
a thousand amped-up geeks.

00:27:31,219 --> 00:27:33,019
I work all kinds of events:

00:27:33,085 --> 00:27:35,519
conventions, fight nights.

00:27:35,585 --> 00:27:36,952
It pays the bills.

00:27:37,019 --> 00:27:38,252
And Stevie knew that.

00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:40,019
He liked a woman
with her own career.

00:27:40,085 --> 00:27:41,085
You're a cyber
league girl.

00:27:41,152 --> 00:27:43,019
You don't make
a lot of money.

00:27:43,085 --> 00:27:45,719
So maybe some nerd offered to
pay you to dose Stevie,

00:27:45,785 --> 00:27:47,385
knock him out of
the tournament

00:27:47,452 --> 00:27:49,452
and share some of the
prize money with you.

00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:51,452
No, I would never do that.

00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:53,819
I loved Stevie.

00:27:53,885 --> 00:27:56,152
And for the record,
I didn't need his money

00:27:56,219 --> 00:27:58,152
or anyone else's.

00:27:58,219 --> 00:28:01,252
I make enough off
my looks to have anything

00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:02,392
that I could ever want--

00:28:02,459 --> 00:28:05,892
except for a man who can see
past them.

00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,892
So, the pot on the cycle
is up to four grand

00:28:10,959 --> 00:28:12,659
if you want
to get in on this.

00:28:12,725 --> 00:28:14,925
If I want to gamble,
I'll go to a casino.

00:28:14,992 --> 00:28:17,159
Fair enough.

00:28:17,225 --> 00:28:19,925
I got back DNA on the blood
from the house.

00:28:19,992 --> 00:28:20,992
Two contributors.

00:28:21,059 --> 00:28:22,159
One was our victim,

00:28:22,225 --> 00:28:24,492
the other
an unknown male.

00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,492
I may be able to help there.

00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:28,792
I ran the prints.

00:28:28,859 --> 00:28:31,625
Most came back
to our victim Ben Fowler,

00:28:31,692 --> 00:28:33,992
a few unknowns,
but we did get one hit

00:28:34,059 --> 00:28:35,625
in the system:

00:28:35,692 --> 00:28:37,092
Carl Jansen.

00:28:37,159 --> 00:28:42,559
STOKES: Nice rap sheet--
burglary, larceny, assault.

00:28:42,625 --> 00:28:43,959
Did you check with PD?

00:28:44,025 --> 00:28:46,392
Yes. He's a loan shark.

00:28:46,459 --> 00:28:48,892
I also checked our
victim's phone records,

00:28:48,959 --> 00:28:52,159
and you can see, that our loan
shark has been calling him.

00:28:52,225 --> 00:28:53,792
Calling him a lot.

00:28:53,859 --> 00:28:55,892
Mm-hmm. Well, Carl doesn't
look like somebody

00:28:55,959 --> 00:28:57,625
you want to owe money to.

00:29:01,392 --> 00:29:04,432
These are your
fingerprints,

00:29:04,499 --> 00:29:05,699
this is your blood,

00:29:05,765 --> 00:29:09,099
and I'm guessing
that's your gun.

00:29:09,165 --> 00:29:11,132
Used to shoot Ben Fowler.

00:29:11,199 --> 00:29:13,332
How much
did he owe you?

00:29:13,399 --> 00:29:15,099
All right, Carl, come on now.

00:29:15,165 --> 00:29:16,932
You save us a little time here,

00:29:16,999 --> 00:29:19,032
we might be able
to return the favor.

00:29:19,099 --> 00:29:20,832
Does that line ever really work?

00:29:20,899 --> 00:29:21,832
Actually, it does.

00:29:21,899 --> 00:29:23,065
It did with Armin Kosh.

00:29:23,132 --> 00:29:25,332
Yeah, when you get
out of the joint,

00:29:25,399 --> 00:29:26,532
I'd suggest
finding yourself a new fence.

00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:28,032
Your boy gave you up
real quick.

00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,999
He paid you $3,000
for the items

00:29:30,065 --> 00:29:31,665
that you stole from
the Alexander house.

00:29:31,732 --> 00:29:33,765
After you put a slug in Ben's
head and dumped him in the pool.

00:29:33,832 --> 00:29:37,265
Sounds like I need to have
a little talk with Armin.

00:29:37,332 --> 00:29:39,265
Threatening to kill someone in
front of a cop?

00:29:39,332 --> 00:29:40,532
That's not real smart.

00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:42,332
I don't kill people.

00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:44,665
Dead people
don't make me money.

00:29:46,165 --> 00:29:48,032
It's my blood,

00:29:48,099 --> 00:29:50,665
my prints.

00:29:50,732 --> 00:29:52,665
I was there... to collect.

00:29:52,732 --> 00:29:55,265
Just give me till Tuesday.

00:29:55,332 --> 00:29:56,332
Tuesday, huh?

00:29:57,699 --> 00:29:58,965
(groans)

00:29:59,032 --> 00:30:00,132
Are you sure
you won't forget?

00:30:00,199 --> 00:30:02,572
Because I think
you're gonna forget.

00:30:02,639 --> 00:30:04,439
(groans)
I swear I won't.

00:30:04,505 --> 00:30:06,372
I think you will.
That's why

00:30:06,439 --> 00:30:07,472
we're gonna settle right now.

00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:09,939
Take the TV...

00:30:10,005 --> 00:30:11,039
take everything.

00:30:12,605 --> 00:30:13,939
Guy owes me money.

00:30:14,005 --> 00:30:17,739
Now, the way this works,
he's gonna owe me more money.

00:30:17,805 --> 00:30:20,739
You want to hook me up
for stealing a TV?

00:30:20,805 --> 00:30:22,105
Go ahead.

00:30:22,172 --> 00:30:24,539
That's all you got.

00:30:27,605 --> 00:30:30,972
Wow-- Kevin,
charming.

00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:31,972
I hate him...

00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:34,105
to the very core
of my being.

00:30:34,172 --> 00:30:35,472
Oh, I hear you.

00:30:35,539 --> 00:30:37,539
I don't even want to tell
you what he just said

00:30:37,605 --> 00:30:39,472
to me in the washroom,
but do me a favor.

00:30:39,539 --> 00:30:42,739
and take a good look at the D.B.
Thank you.

00:30:46,805 --> 00:30:49,239
Dude, I'm rolling
a natural here.

00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:51,805
I told CSI Redhead I'm
putting five large on her.

00:30:51,872 --> 00:30:53,739
I'm gonna score and
then I'm gonna score.

00:30:53,805 --> 00:30:55,105
If you think
for one second

00:30:55,172 --> 00:30:58,039
that Catherine would actually
lower herself--

00:30:58,105 --> 00:30:59,772
There's no way this old lady
didn't die of old age.

00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:01,512
(annoyed sigh)

00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,945
Paramedics found her on
the stairs.

00:31:13,512 --> 00:31:15,079
(tissue crackling)

00:31:15,145 --> 00:31:16,479
Dude, that's my corpse.

00:31:16,545 --> 00:31:17,912
Shh.

00:31:17,979 --> 00:31:19,812
Hear that crepitis sound?

00:31:19,879 --> 00:31:21,279
She has osteoporosis.

00:31:21,345 --> 00:31:24,445
Yeah, Grey's Anatomy,--
she's old.

00:31:24,512 --> 00:31:26,212
Well, the injury indicates
that she probably fell

00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:28,045
and fractured her femur;
caused a blood clot.

00:31:28,112 --> 00:31:30,412
No way her death was a natural.

00:31:30,479 --> 00:31:31,445
It was an accident.

00:31:31,512 --> 00:31:33,745
Can we just keep this
between us?

00:31:33,812 --> 00:31:35,379
No.

00:31:38,045 --> 00:31:39,412
Diagnose this, Quincy--

00:31:39,479 --> 00:31:42,345
why does my head ache
the more I'm around you?

00:31:42,412 --> 00:31:43,445
(pills rattle in bottle)

00:31:52,312 --> 00:31:55,579
Hey, got an AG waiver on Evan
Ferrari's phone and ISP.

00:31:55,645 --> 00:31:59,245
Our cyber league girl wasn't
kidding about loving DV8.

00:31:59,312 --> 00:32:02,285
If anything, she might have
loved him a little too much.

00:32:02,352 --> 00:32:04,385
"Find another beer belly to rub.
DV8's mine."

00:32:04,452 --> 00:32:08,319
"Text DV8 again and your phone
will blow off your fingers."

00:32:08,385 --> 00:32:09,785
Do gamers have groupies?

00:32:09,852 --> 00:32:12,052
Haven't you seen
<i>The Social Network?</i>

00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:15,985
Hey, bank. Hope you got
my stomach contents there.

00:32:16,052 --> 00:32:17,985
Look, I'm really sorry
I fell a little behind.

00:32:18,052 --> 00:32:20,385
I can't believe I got roped
into being everybody's bookie.

00:32:20,452 --> 00:32:23,252
So, your gamer didn't just
have Zolpidem in his system.

00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:25,052
The extended tox panel says

00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:27,319
his pizza had an extra topping:
Emetine.

00:32:27,385 --> 00:32:29,785
SIDLE:
Hm. Primary alkaloid in ipecac.

00:32:29,852 --> 00:32:31,285
Used to induce vomiting.

00:32:31,352 --> 00:32:32,719
If you knock
somebody out

00:32:32,785 --> 00:32:35,585
with Zolpidem,
and then feed him a pizza

00:32:35,652 --> 00:32:36,785
with ipecac...

00:32:36,852 --> 00:32:38,719
Hello Jimmy Hendrix,
good-bye DV8.

00:32:38,785 --> 00:32:40,485
He chokes to death on his vomit.

00:32:40,552 --> 00:32:41,752
So, Evan's pissed
at her boyfriend

00:32:41,819 --> 00:32:42,919
for doing a little
groupie-grabbing.

00:32:42,985 --> 00:32:44,419
What do you got for me,
LeftBrain?

00:32:44,485 --> 00:32:46,085
You walked right into my trap.

00:32:46,152 --> 00:32:49,919
SARA: <i>She mixes him
a nightcap.</i>

00:32:49,985 --> 00:32:51,852
Don't think I don't
need to see you

00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:53,119
behind that
rock to kill you.

00:32:53,185 --> 00:32:54,252
There you are.

00:32:58,219 --> 00:32:59,552
SIDLE: <i>Adds in some
special sauce.</i>

00:32:59,619 --> 00:33:02,492
Looks like you could use
a midnight snack, baby.

00:33:07,725 --> 00:33:09,325
(gagging)

00:33:09,392 --> 00:33:10,592
I buy it.

00:33:10,659 --> 00:33:11,759
But how do you prove it?

00:33:11,825 --> 00:33:13,959
Well, we still have
her bottle of Zolpidem.

00:33:14,025 --> 00:33:15,325
Now we can actually print it.

00:33:15,392 --> 00:33:16,559
I'll go get it.

00:33:16,625 --> 00:33:17,959
And I'll print
the pizza box.

00:33:18,025 --> 00:33:21,159
If she served him his last meal,
that puts the pizza in her hand.

00:33:21,225 --> 00:33:24,159
♪ ♪

00:33:50,459 --> 00:33:52,359
(goofy voice):
Pizza, pizza.

00:33:53,892 --> 00:33:55,925
Sorry. I had to.

00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:57,092
What are you delivering, Greg?

00:33:57,159 --> 00:34:00,059
Oh, just our
prime suspect.

00:34:00,125 --> 00:34:02,765
Sara and I ran prints on the
pizza box and Zolpidem bottle.

00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:06,265
Both came back to a work card
for a Monica Gimble--

00:34:06,332 --> 00:34:08,332
better known
as DJ Drang.

00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:11,465
She's working the
Cyber Bowl-- the emcee.

00:34:11,532 --> 00:34:14,299
For a big guy in a diaper,

00:34:14,365 --> 00:34:16,365
DV8 sure knew how to
attract some killer babes.

00:34:22,106 --> 00:34:24,706
So you were moonlighting
as a pizza delivery girl.

00:34:24,773 --> 00:34:26,140
Excuse me?

00:34:26,206 --> 00:34:28,640
Well, you delivered
a pizza to DV8Avenger

00:34:28,706 --> 00:34:30,473
the night he choked and
croaked... didn't you?

00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:32,673
So I delivered
a pizza to a friend.

00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:35,040
The man liked to eat.

00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:36,073
No, I understand.

00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,373
Hey, listen,
I love pizza, you know?

00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,506
I'm from the East Coast.

00:34:38,573 --> 00:34:39,873
I like it, you know,
I like New York style pizza.

00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:44,240
You know, I never had a pizza
to go that had ipecac on it?

00:34:44,306 --> 00:34:45,873
It must be a Vegas thing.

00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:48,340
You know, ipecac, you gotta get
it from an on line pharmacy.

00:34:48,406 --> 00:34:49,773
and you gotta use
your credit card.

00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,473
And you used your credit card.

00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:54,373
So, we got you for
the ipecac.

00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,706
And the lab guys told me

00:34:55,773 --> 00:34:57,473
it was combined with
a drug called Zolpidem.

00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:00,006
And here's where it gets
a little salacious.

00:35:00,073 --> 00:35:02,580
Your fingerprints
are on the bottle,

00:35:02,646 --> 00:35:04,846
and Evan Ferrari's name
is on the script.

00:35:04,913 --> 00:35:06,980
So we know
you know her.

00:35:07,046 --> 00:35:09,313
The question is how well?

00:35:10,413 --> 00:35:12,213
We're just friends.

00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,780
"Just friends" with benefits?

00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:16,980
We thought you were
in on it together

00:35:17,046 --> 00:35:20,480
until we read the e-mail
where she dumped you.

00:35:20,546 --> 00:35:22,980
You were girlfriend
and girlfriend.

00:35:23,046 --> 00:35:25,346
You shared everything;
you shared the Zolpidem.

00:35:25,413 --> 00:35:28,246
But you didn't share her
newfound taste in men, right?

00:35:32,346 --> 00:35:36,380
I thought she was going through
some weird experimental phase.

00:35:36,446 --> 00:35:38,513
Yeah, I know what you mean,
I saw the guy.
Right?

00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:40,746
I mean, if you're going to
go join the other team,

00:35:40,813 --> 00:35:42,613
at least make it
a model or a jock,

00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,880
not... Jabba the Hutt.

00:35:44,946 --> 00:35:48,080
The bastard even
threw it in my face.

00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,180
How his thumbs had
given her more pleasure

00:35:50,246 --> 00:35:51,680
than she'd ever known.

00:35:51,746 --> 00:35:52,813
So he had to go.

00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,246
I loved Evan, and he
stole her from me.

00:35:55,313 --> 00:35:57,246
And then he's about
to win the Cyber Bowl,

00:35:57,313 --> 00:35:59,480
walk away with
a hundred grand?

00:35:59,546 --> 00:36:00,813
He didn't deserve
any of that.

00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,286
So you spiked his
pizza and his soda.

00:36:02,353 --> 00:36:04,953
I knew the fat pig couldn't
turn down free food

00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,320
and a little come-on.

00:36:06,386 --> 00:36:08,020
Double bonus!

00:36:08,086 --> 00:36:11,353
I just wanted to
wish you luck.

00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:13,753
Want some company?

00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:18,553
(gagging)

00:36:21,253 --> 00:36:24,186
I thought, fat guy,
stuffing his face,

00:36:24,253 --> 00:36:26,020
chokes on his own vomit...

00:36:26,086 --> 00:36:27,386
who's going to
investigate that?

00:36:27,453 --> 00:36:28,553
Let me guess.

00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,786
Me?

00:36:36,353 --> 00:36:39,786
Hey, Catherine, I ran
ballistics on our bullet.

00:36:39,853 --> 00:36:41,186
It came from
the gun in the pool,

00:36:41,253 --> 00:36:42,786
but the gun's
not in the system.

00:36:42,853 --> 00:36:45,653
Well, it's not like we expected
loan shark Carl to get sloppy.

00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:48,453
So I got a call from the
Alexanders' insurance adjustor.

00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,153
He accounted for all
of the electronics

00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,553
that Carl boosted
from the house,

00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:53,553
but there was one additional
item missing-- a sculpture.

00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:55,053
Is it valuable?

00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,153
Worth about ten grand, so Vice
talked to Carl's fence,

00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:59,953
he never saw it, and PD's
canvassing pawn shops.

00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,960
We'll see what we get.
All right.

00:37:02,026 --> 00:37:05,260
This case will just not
die a natural death.

00:37:05,326 --> 00:37:08,026
I pulled some very interesting
trace from your gun.

00:37:08,093 --> 00:37:09,993
Uh, more specifically,
from the front sight--

00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:12,326
human tissue.

00:37:12,393 --> 00:37:13,393
The killer's?

00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:15,893
Unfortunately for
Nick's and my

00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,493
apparently ill-advised wager,

00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,960
it belongs to the victim.

00:37:19,026 --> 00:37:20,460
Tissue from his tongue.

00:37:20,526 --> 00:37:23,360
So the killer shoved the
gun into Fowler's mouth.

00:37:23,426 --> 00:37:24,593
That's not possible.

00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,326
There was no GSR
around the wound.

00:37:26,393 --> 00:37:27,793
Maybe Fowler was
shot underwater?

00:37:31,893 --> 00:37:33,660
Sorry, boss.
It's just a theory.

00:37:33,726 --> 00:37:36,426
I mean, we're all under a lot
of pressure here, but...

00:37:36,493 --> 00:37:39,126
All right, so, if you found
tissue from the victim's tongue

00:37:39,193 --> 00:37:40,526
on the sight,

00:37:40,593 --> 00:37:43,393
that means that not only was
the gun inside his mouth,

00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:45,626
but that it was upside-down.

00:37:45,693 --> 00:37:47,693
And a gun in this position,

00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,493
looks more like
suicide than murder.

00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:54,526
Which is consistent with
Ben Fowler's state of mind.

00:37:54,593 --> 00:37:56,026
Divorced, in debt...

00:37:56,093 --> 00:37:57,793
What about the break-in?

00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:00,626
The guy was tied up
and dumped in the pool.

00:38:00,693 --> 00:38:02,233
You saying it was staged?
No.

00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:04,233
The evidence
is saying it.

00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:07,233
♪ ♪

00:38:32,533 --> 00:38:35,466
♪ ♪

00:39:08,873 --> 00:39:10,840
STOKES: The shoeprint on
the door was a match

00:39:10,906 --> 00:39:12,673
to a pair of Ben Fowler's shoes.

00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:14,540
So, he kicks in the door,

00:39:16,106 --> 00:39:18,006
<i>punches a hole
in the window,</i>

00:39:18,073 --> 00:39:20,073
<i>then tries to make it all
look like a break-in.</i>

00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:23,506
WILLOWS: Doc Robbins found rope
fibers in the victim's teeth.

00:39:23,573 --> 00:39:25,306
And Hodges proved
that it is possible

00:39:25,373 --> 00:39:26,840
to tie yourself into knots.

00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:32,873
STOKES:
<i>So he wasn't trying to
loosen his restraints,</i>

00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,206
<i>he was trying to tighten them.</i>

00:39:34,273 --> 00:39:35,206
WILLOWS:
<i>Apparently.</i>

00:39:37,206 --> 00:39:39,473
<i>And when he fired
the gun underwater,</i>

00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:42,306
<i>the flames were extinguished,</i>

00:39:42,373 --> 00:39:44,806
<i>which explains why there
was no GSR in his mouth.</i>

00:39:44,873 --> 00:39:47,506
Now why would he go through so
much trouble to make a suicide

00:39:47,573 --> 00:39:48,740
look like a homicide?

00:39:48,806 --> 00:39:50,340
Because he wanted
to make amends.

00:39:50,406 --> 00:39:54,340
Look, the man's life
was in pieces.

00:39:54,406 --> 00:39:57,440
He's divorced, he'd gotten
pulled over for a DUI.

00:39:57,506 --> 00:39:59,340
His ex-wife had to
come bail him out.

00:39:59,406 --> 00:40:00,740
That couldn't
have felt good.

00:40:00,806 --> 00:40:02,113
Then Carl Jansen beats him up.

00:40:03,513 --> 00:40:05,780
<i>And while he's watching
Carl and his thugs</i>

00:40:05,846 --> 00:40:07,413
<i>tear apart his friend's home,</i>

00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:10,446
<i>maybe Ben thought there was a
way for him to be a man again,</i>

00:40:10,513 --> 00:40:12,980
<i>to be a husband, a provider.</i>

00:40:13,046 --> 00:40:16,346
LANGSTON: The pawnshop
owner I.D.'d Ben

00:40:16,413 --> 00:40:17,513
the morning of his death.

00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:22,513
Said he came into shop
and pawned the sculpture.

00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:23,413
A thousand bucks.

00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,280
A million, actually.

00:40:25,346 --> 00:40:27,446
What do you mean?
Ben didn't take the cash.

00:40:27,513 --> 00:40:31,380
He had the pawnshop wire the
money to an insurance company.

00:40:32,313 --> 00:40:33,946
WILLOWS:
Life insurance.

00:40:34,013 --> 00:40:36,113
LANGSTON:
Had a million dollar policy.

00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:38,946
He was behind on some of the
payments, but he used the money

00:40:39,013 --> 00:40:42,946
from the sculpture to pay off
the remaining balance.

00:40:43,013 --> 00:40:46,113
OLIVIA FOWLER: <i>He killed himself
so I could have the money?</i>

00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:48,113
You said you never
stopped loving him.

00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,813
Well, clearly, he never
stopped loving you.

00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,080
You know, when a man

00:40:56,146 --> 00:41:00,613
lets his wife down,
loses her...

00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,153
sometimes he can
lose himself.

00:41:06,886 --> 00:41:10,520
When your marriage fails,
what no one tells us is that

00:41:10,586 --> 00:41:13,620
it makes us feel like
we've failed somehow.

00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,720
I'm not sure who failed who.

00:41:26,053 --> 00:41:28,320
Last body of the shift.

00:41:28,386 --> 00:41:30,886
Dare I ask?

00:41:30,953 --> 00:41:31,953
Homicide.

00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:34,420
Liquor store robbery.
Single GSW.

00:41:34,486 --> 00:41:36,620
So much for hitting the cycle.

00:41:36,686 --> 00:41:38,586
PHILLIPS: Unbelievable.
It's one shift,

00:41:38,653 --> 00:41:42,053
five homicides, two suicides,
three accidentals,

00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,786
not a single natural.

00:41:43,853 --> 00:41:47,986
All it takes is old age,
heart attack, stroke, aneurysm.

00:41:48,053 --> 00:41:50,920
Well, you and Kevin get
our vic washed up and prepped.

00:41:50,986 --> 00:41:52,186
Then go home.

00:41:52,253 --> 00:41:53,753
Got it.

00:41:56,853 --> 00:41:59,686
Kevin.

00:41:59,753 --> 00:42:02,326
Wake. Up.

00:42:02,393 --> 00:42:04,826
Kevin! I need help!

00:42:04,893 --> 00:42:06,260
Okay, you are
such a sack of...

00:42:13,193 --> 00:42:14,826
Doc?

00:42:14,893 --> 00:42:18,960
David, don't be a snitch,
just wake him up

00:42:19,026 --> 00:42:20,626
so I can fire him.

00:42:20,693 --> 00:42:22,293
Uh, he's dead.

00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,426
Yeah, he said
he had a headache.

00:42:24,493 --> 00:42:26,193
He's been popping
aspirin all day.

00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:27,926
Thought he was hung over.

00:42:30,226 --> 00:42:31,860
ROBBINS:
Blown pupil.

00:42:31,926 --> 00:42:33,160
Aneurysm.

00:42:33,226 --> 00:42:35,626
Well, there's your natural.

00:42:35,693 --> 00:42:36,993
We completed the cycle.

00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:39,060
Yeah.
But nobody won.

00:42:39,126 --> 00:42:40,626
Au contraire.

00:42:40,693 --> 00:42:41,660
I did.

00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:44,360
You found the body,
did you not?

00:42:44,426 --> 00:42:46,760
Yeah. So?
My money was on you.

00:42:46,826 --> 00:42:50,993
Most natural deaths
aren't investigated by CSI.

00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:53,493
But when a body drops,
you're always there.

00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:56,226
Even when the body
drops in your lap.

00:42:56,293 --> 00:42:58,426
Sorry, Kevin.

00:42:59,726 --> 00:43:01,160
(sighs)

00:43:01,226 --> 00:43:03,933
Uh, are you calling 911?

00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,800
No, I'm calling Henry.
