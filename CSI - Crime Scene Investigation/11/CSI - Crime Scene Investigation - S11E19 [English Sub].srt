00:00:02,171 --> 00:00:04,104
(panting)

00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,508
(grunting)

00:00:11,172 --> 00:00:12,879
(gasping)

00:00:18,174 --> 00:00:20,487
(growling)

00:00:20,487 --> 00:00:22,522
(screams)

00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:23,865
(roars)

00:00:23,865 --> 00:00:25,967
Kid on the
ATV rolled up

00:00:25,967 --> 00:00:27,836
on a mountain lion
mauling a body.

00:00:27,836 --> 00:00:29,838
He made a serious U-turn
and called it in.

00:00:29,838 --> 00:00:31,006
But where is
the perp now?

00:00:31,006 --> 00:00:32,107
Animal Control
is on the scene.

00:00:32,107 --> 00:00:33,516
They're looking
for him.

00:00:33,516 --> 00:00:35,176
Body up here?
Yeah.

00:00:35,176 --> 00:00:38,113
No I.D. yet.

00:00:43,515 --> 00:00:45,954
Leotard--
not exactly dressed

00:00:45,954 --> 00:00:47,515
for the mountains.

00:00:47,515 --> 00:00:49,190
She was definitely
not out here hiking.

00:00:53,516 --> 00:00:56,521
Looks like she tried to crawl
back up to the road for help.

00:00:56,521 --> 00:00:58,521
LANGSTON:
I didn't see a car.

00:00:58,521 --> 00:01:00,235
The nearest house is
ten miles away.

00:01:00,235 --> 00:01:01,522
How did she get out here?

00:01:09,518 --> 00:01:11,522
Bite marks.

00:01:11,522 --> 00:01:13,281
The surrounding tissue
is contused.

00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:14,519
The bite's antemortem.

00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:17,118
She was alive
when she was attacked.

00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:18,119
(roars)

00:01:22,514 --> 00:01:24,517
SIDLE: Lion may have left
something behind.

00:01:24,517 --> 00:01:26,027
Piece of a tooth.

00:01:27,062 --> 00:01:29,513
Maybe he bit off
more than he could chew.

00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:32,514
Sara, I don't think

00:01:32,514 --> 00:01:34,235
that a lion could have done
all this damage.

00:01:34,235 --> 00:01:37,839
She's got fresh knuckle
contusions around her eyes

00:01:37,839 --> 00:01:40,341
and older symmetrical bruises
on her legs.

00:01:40,341 --> 00:01:41,876
Could be from restraints.

00:01:41,876 --> 00:01:43,513
A young woman out here
in the middle

00:01:43,513 --> 00:01:44,913
of nowhere?
Maybe she escaped

00:01:44,913 --> 00:01:47,518
from one animal
only to fall prey to another.

You okay?

00:02:33,515 --> 00:02:35,230
Now I know why you can
get a steak and eggs

00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:37,065
for $1.99 in
this town.

00:02:37,065 --> 00:02:38,513
Well, the funny thing is,

00:02:38,513 --> 00:02:40,519
the casino's probably
losing money.
(groans)

00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:41,870
But you're in the door.

00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,372
Drop a couple 20's
in the nickel machines,

00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:46,875
and at least you can say to
yourself, "I ate for cheap."

00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:50,044
I had three orders, man,
and I still ate for cheap.

00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:51,946
(chuckles)
Hey, you think three steaks

00:02:51,946 --> 00:02:54,522
and six eggs is bad
for you, Doctor?

00:02:54,522 --> 00:02:56,017
You know what
coroners say, Nick.

00:02:56,017 --> 00:02:58,887
Everybody eventually dies
of a heart attack.

00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,455
Whoa, whoa-- what's this?
What's this?
MAN:
<i>Ayúdame!Help!</i>

00:03:00,455 --> 00:03:01,456
<i>Ayúdame!</i>

00:03:01,456 --> 00:03:02,924
STOKES:
What's going on?

00:03:02,924 --> 00:03:03,925
A girl-- she's dead.

00:03:03,925 --> 00:03:05,160
I saw her
through the window.

00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,161
No, no one home!

00:03:06,161 --> 00:03:07,515
No one home!

00:03:07,515 --> 00:03:10,231
Dispatch, this is
Charlie-05 Stokes.

00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:14,169
I got a possible 405-Zebra
at Goodland and Erwin.

00:03:14,169 --> 00:03:15,436
Roll medical my location.

00:03:15,436 --> 00:03:17,305
DISPATCH:
Copy that.

00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:21,519
Las Vegas Police!

00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:22,977
(knocking on door)

00:03:26,181 --> 00:03:28,216
Vegas Police!

00:03:28,216 --> 00:03:29,522
Anybody home?!

00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,129
Oh, no.

00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:52,006
No pulse...

00:03:52,006 --> 00:03:54,943
but warm to the touch.

00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,519
This just happened.

00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:57,979
What a shame.

00:03:57,979 --> 00:04:00,281
Yeah. Just stay with her.

00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:01,521
I'll get my kit.

00:04:01,521 --> 00:04:03,017
I'll call David.

00:04:10,325 --> 00:04:11,459
Nick!
Yeah.

00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,027
She's pregnant.

00:04:14,262 --> 00:04:15,518
Fetus is moving!

00:04:15,518 --> 00:04:18,066
We gotta get the baby out now!
Give me your knife.

00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,517
Put her on the bed,
right here.

00:04:24,517 --> 00:04:27,108
We're gonna do a crash
C-section.

00:04:27,108 --> 00:04:29,844
Find me something to put
the baby in.

00:04:29,844 --> 00:04:31,145
She's almost to term.

00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:32,280
Here we go.

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,984
(groans)
All right, Nick,
I'm gonna need your hands.

00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:38,887
Yeah.
Hold the abdomen
and the uterus open

00:04:38,887 --> 00:04:40,154
Okay.
as wide as you can.

00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:42,056
That's it! Wider!
(groans)

00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:46,060
(both grunt)

00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,428
Oh, she's not breathing.

00:04:47,428 --> 00:04:49,130
Okay, you got a clamp
or forceps? Anything?

00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:50,465
Yeah, yeah.
That's it,
that's it.

00:04:50,465 --> 00:04:52,934
Close to the navel
as you can.

00:04:52,934 --> 00:04:54,435
That's it.

00:04:54,435 --> 00:04:55,517
All right.

00:04:55,517 --> 00:04:56,522
Okay, just...

00:04:58,206 --> 00:04:59,941
Give me a pen.

00:04:59,941 --> 00:05:01,517
Take the top off it.
That's it.

00:05:04,521 --> 00:05:05,813
Where's the top?

00:05:05,813 --> 00:05:07,522
All right.

00:05:07,522 --> 00:05:10,520
(inhaling, spitting)

00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,853
Come on, Doc...

00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:15,514
She's still not
breathing.

00:05:15,514 --> 00:05:17,158
Okay, here we go.

00:05:17,158 --> 00:05:18,159
Don't die.

00:05:19,227 --> 00:05:20,328
Come on, come on...

00:05:21,429 --> 00:05:22,518
Come on, Doc.

00:05:23,517 --> 00:05:24,518
(cries)

00:05:24,518 --> 00:05:25,519
There it is!
Ah!

00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:27,168
Oh, God!

00:05:27,168 --> 00:05:28,836
That's it!
That's it.

00:05:28,836 --> 00:05:30,071
Good little girl.

00:05:30,071 --> 00:05:32,373
Oh, man, good job.
Good job.

00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:34,275
Okay, she's gonna need
respiratory support.

00:05:34,275 --> 00:05:36,077
Here you go.

00:05:36,077 --> 00:05:37,078
(stops crying)

00:05:37,078 --> 00:05:38,479
(sirens approaching)

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,381
Oh, I got ya.

00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:41,816
(Stokes sighs,
baby girl coos)

00:05:47,989 --> 00:05:50,513
Looks like a compression
fracture of the tib-fib.

00:05:50,513 --> 00:05:51,859
More than likely

00:05:51,859 --> 00:05:54,128
a vertical drop as opposed
to a slide down a hillside.

00:05:54,128 --> 00:05:55,129
Mm-hmm.

00:05:55,129 --> 00:05:57,518
She has deep gouges
in both legs.

00:05:57,518 --> 00:05:59,901
To a hungry carnivore,
her calves are like

00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:03,438
a porterhouse steak;
thick, meaty, bone in.

00:06:03,438 --> 00:06:06,519
It's hard to see at night,
but her jaw's broken.

00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:07,976
Blunt-force
trauma injury.

00:06:07,976 --> 00:06:11,212
I don't know any lions
with a good right hook.

00:06:11,212 --> 00:06:12,213
Neither do I.

00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:16,384
Some broken teeth.
Some missing.

00:06:16,384 --> 00:06:18,453
Six and 11 show signs
of dental work.

00:06:18,453 --> 00:06:23,515
And these posts I'm seeing
suggest prosthetics.

00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:26,514
SIDLE:
Maybe this broken tooth

00:06:26,514 --> 00:06:27,996
isn't feline;
maybe it's hers.

00:06:31,515 --> 00:06:34,068
There's an unusual amount
of trace on this body.

00:06:34,068 --> 00:06:35,236
Considering the fall
she took,

00:06:35,236 --> 00:06:37,405
the way she was dragged
through the woods,

00:06:37,405 --> 00:06:39,340
she would have
shed most of it.

00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,275
But she hasn't.
She's covered in pine needles.

00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:42,910
I didn't see any pine trees
at the scene.

00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:44,412
I didn't either.

00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:52,220
I think I may have the answer.

00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:56,522
I have two burn marks here,
four centimeters apart.

00:06:56,522 --> 00:07:00,094
These look like they might be
injuries from a stun gun.

00:07:00,094 --> 00:07:01,462
A stun gun would have

00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:03,522
imparted the body
with electrical current

00:07:03,522 --> 00:07:06,167
turning the victim
into a human lint brush.

00:07:06,167 --> 00:07:09,303
<i>Stun gun would have put her</i>
<i>down for about a minute.</i>

00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:11,521
<i>Enough time to allow trace</i>
<i>to adhere to her body</i>

00:07:11,521 --> 00:07:12,840
<i>through static electricity.</i>

00:07:15,516 --> 00:07:17,378
SIDLE:
She's in the system.

00:07:17,378 --> 00:07:19,522
Iona Vail. Social worker.

00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,516
Health card from Hope's Path.

00:07:21,516 --> 00:07:23,518
The battered women's shelter.
Yeah.

00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:27,513
Spends her life helping women
dodge punches,

00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:30,091
but she couldn't dodge this one.

00:07:30,091 --> 00:07:32,522
SIDLE:<i>When was the last time</i>
<i>that you saw Iona?</i>

00:07:32,522 --> 00:07:37,265
Uh, it was about
six weeks ago.

00:07:37,265 --> 00:07:39,100
She told me she was quitting.

00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,169
It was right after
she broke up

00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,514
with her boyfriend;
no good-bye,

00:07:42,514 --> 00:07:44,516
nothing.
And how long have you

00:07:44,516 --> 00:07:46,514
and Iona been running
the shelter?

00:07:46,514 --> 00:07:48,109
Together?

00:07:48,109 --> 00:07:49,514
About two years.

00:07:49,514 --> 00:07:52,113
I was, uh,
one of these women once.

00:07:52,113 --> 00:07:54,514
I walked in the door,

00:07:54,514 --> 00:07:58,453
and there was Iona with her
easy, "everything's gonna

00:07:58,453 --> 00:07:59,921
be all right" smile.

00:07:59,921 --> 00:08:01,923
And it was.

00:08:01,923 --> 00:08:03,521
You never went home?

00:08:03,521 --> 00:08:06,515
Iona made me see it wasn't
worthy of the name.

00:08:06,515 --> 00:08:09,964
No, this is where
I belong.

00:08:09,964 --> 00:08:11,099
Women's shelter--

00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:13,000
you must get more
than a few threats.

00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,516
It's an occupational hazard.

00:08:14,516 --> 00:08:17,516
Every woman in here is
a victim of violence,

00:08:17,516 --> 00:08:21,075
which means that someone out
there-- husband, boyfriend--

00:08:21,075 --> 00:08:22,513
is a potential threat.

00:08:22,513 --> 00:08:24,518
Did anyone ever threaten Iona?

00:08:24,518 --> 00:08:26,080
Not to my knowledge.

00:08:27,815 --> 00:08:29,383
That was Iona's desk.

00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:31,520
She never even came back
for her stuff.

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,355
Do you mind if I take a look?

00:08:46,167 --> 00:08:47,435
I'd like to take this.

00:08:47,435 --> 00:08:48,870
Yeah, whatever you need.

00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,905
Please...

00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:53,141
just find whoever did this.

00:09:00,381 --> 00:09:03,317
Maria Diorio. Just 17.

00:09:03,317 --> 00:09:06,020
Junior at Carver High.

00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,518
Albert...

00:09:07,518 --> 00:09:09,515
what you did today

00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:11,425
was incredible.

00:09:13,513 --> 00:09:16,063
It was like being part
of a miracle or something.

00:09:16,063 --> 00:09:19,233
It felt good helping
the living for a change.

00:09:19,233 --> 00:09:21,936
You're a good man.

00:09:24,305 --> 00:09:27,521
Petechial hemorrhaging
present in the eyes,

00:09:27,521 --> 00:09:29,517
inside the lips.

00:09:29,517 --> 00:09:32,246
C.O.D. is asphyxiation.
No ligature marks.

00:09:32,246 --> 00:09:34,081
Blood didn't get
a chance to settle.

00:09:34,081 --> 00:09:35,349
Pregnant girl.
Teen suicide.

00:09:35,349 --> 00:09:36,522
With or without
ligature marks,

00:09:36,522 --> 00:09:37,885
it's pretty
straightforward.

00:09:37,885 --> 00:09:40,154
I thought so, too,
until I found these.

00:09:40,154 --> 00:09:43,518
Four simultaneous contused
finger impressions on

00:09:43,518 --> 00:09:45,293
the back of the forearm,

00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,995
a single thumb impression
on the front.

00:09:47,995 --> 00:09:49,330
STOKES:
Same on this side.

00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:50,522
Forcibly grabbed.

00:09:50,522 --> 00:09:52,967
The fact that we can even
see the bruises tells me

00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,101
they were inflicted

00:09:54,101 --> 00:09:55,519
less than two hours
before her death.

00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,518
So there was definitely a
struggle before she died.

00:09:57,518 --> 00:10:00,241
Leading cause of death in
pregnant women is

00:10:00,241 --> 00:10:01,520
expectant fathers.

00:10:09,917 --> 00:10:12,520
I'm looking
for someone in charge.

00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,515
I was told
my daughter is here.

00:10:14,515 --> 00:10:15,890
Her name is Maria.

00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:17,291
Maria Diorio.

00:10:19,517 --> 00:10:20,995
Mrs. Diorio,

00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:22,515
my name is Nick Stokes.

00:10:22,515 --> 00:10:24,065
I'm a crime scene
investigator.

00:10:24,065 --> 00:10:25,399
I'm handling
Maria's case.

00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:27,134
I'm so sorry for your loss.

00:10:27,134 --> 00:10:28,522
But the good news is
your granddaughter's

00:10:28,522 --> 00:10:31,518
still fighting the good fight
over at Desert Palm.

00:10:31,518 --> 00:10:32,907
Granddaughter?

00:10:32,907 --> 00:10:35,910
You must have my daughter
confused with somebody else.

00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,378
Let's sit down here.

00:10:37,378 --> 00:10:39,413
I don't want
to sit down.

00:10:39,413 --> 00:10:40,915
I want to know what
the hell happened.

00:10:40,915 --> 00:10:43,521
When I left for work this
morning, Maria was fine.

00:10:43,521 --> 00:10:46,522
No, ma'am, she was eight-
and-a-half-months pregnant.

00:10:46,522 --> 00:10:48,513
What are you talking about?!

00:10:48,513 --> 00:10:50,925
Maria wasn't having sex.

00:10:50,925 --> 00:10:52,960
I helped deliver the baby.

00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,429
Why don't we have
a seat?

00:11:02,403 --> 00:11:04,238
I don't understand
any of this.

00:11:04,238 --> 00:11:09,877
Did Maria have a boyfriend?

00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:11,312
I don't know.

00:11:11,312 --> 00:11:14,215
She had a few dates
here and there.

00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:17,351
And do you know any of the
names of the guys she dated?

00:11:17,351 --> 00:11:20,421
We live under the same roof,
but we hardly talked.

00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:24,517
She blamed me for
her dad's death.

00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:27,895
(voice breaking):
He had a heart attack.

00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,432
And he's left me to
pick up the pieces,

00:11:31,432 --> 00:11:33,518
and I'm hardly
holding it together.

00:11:35,336 --> 00:11:36,971
I can't handle
this right now.

00:11:36,971 --> 00:11:38,472
I understand, but-but now,

00:11:38,472 --> 00:11:41,518
I can have an officer drive you
to the hospital, if you'd like

00:11:41,518 --> 00:11:43,844
to see your
granddaughter.

00:12:16,977 --> 00:12:19,013
♪ ♪

00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,521
LANGSTON:
Hey, Sara.
Hey.

00:12:24,521 --> 00:12:27,288
I've been going through

00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,856
Iona's stuff from the shelter.

00:12:28,856 --> 00:12:29,857
According to her date book,

00:12:29,857 --> 00:12:31,258
her last appointment,

00:12:31,258 --> 00:12:33,521
right before she disappeared,
was with a Dr. K.

00:12:35,196 --> 00:12:37,198
(computer chirping)

00:12:38,515 --> 00:12:40,515
This changes everything.

00:12:44,515 --> 00:12:46,407
Lady Heather?

00:12:46,407 --> 00:12:49,076
Actually, it's
Dr. Kessler now.

00:12:49,076 --> 00:12:51,078
It's good to
see you, Sara.

00:12:51,078 --> 00:12:52,521
How's Gil?
How are the Moche?

00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:54,215
Both still in Peru.

00:12:55,249 --> 00:12:57,818
And you must be Dr. Langston.

00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,355
I've been expecting you.

00:13:06,513 --> 00:13:07,995
Iona came to see
me after exhausting

00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:09,463
more conventional
psychotherapy--

00:13:09,463 --> 00:13:12,099
a diagnosis of exclusion,
if you like.

00:13:12,099 --> 00:13:14,514
According
to these, Doctor,

00:13:14,514 --> 00:13:16,513
you're a sex therapist.

00:13:16,513 --> 00:13:19,106
What exactly were Iona's issues?

00:13:19,106 --> 00:13:21,514
Iona was robbed
of her childhood.

00:13:21,514 --> 00:13:23,522
Her mother died when
she was young, her father hit

00:13:23,522 --> 00:13:27,181
the bottle, and Iona was left
to raise her four siblings.

00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:28,883
So naturally, she was drawn

00:13:28,883 --> 00:13:30,516
to looking after
and protecting other women.

00:13:30,516 --> 00:13:33,454
Her entire life,
Iona took care of others

00:13:33,454 --> 00:13:34,922
to the detriment
of her own needs.

00:13:34,922 --> 00:13:36,522
My job was to help
her express

00:13:36,522 --> 00:13:40,361
a deep-seated longing
for love and nurture.

00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:41,522
And you did that how?

00:13:41,522 --> 00:13:44,398
I didn't diagnose

00:13:44,398 --> 00:13:46,519
three nights
in Lady Heather's dungeon.

00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:48,521
I suggested she express herself

00:13:48,521 --> 00:13:50,204
through Gestalt
role-playing.

00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:52,139
And what was that role?

00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:54,175
After preliminary psychotherapy,

00:13:54,175 --> 00:13:56,517
she imagined herself as a cat.

00:13:56,517 --> 00:13:57,517
A cat?

00:13:57,517 --> 00:13:58,946
That was her starting point.

00:13:58,946 --> 00:14:01,015
Did she have a
cat as a child?

00:14:01,015 --> 00:14:02,416
Yes, growing up.

00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:04,514
The one member
of her broken family

00:14:04,514 --> 00:14:06,821
who never wanted for affection

00:14:06,821 --> 00:14:08,923
was a plump little tabby.

00:14:08,923 --> 00:14:10,224
You're not serious.

00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:13,522
Role-play is a legitimate
form of therapy--

00:14:13,522 --> 00:14:16,514
a safe way to access
one's desires...

00:14:16,514 --> 00:14:18,518
and one's demons.

00:14:18,518 --> 00:14:20,167
Right, Doctor?

00:14:20,167 --> 00:14:22,514
You're the expert.

00:14:26,173 --> 00:14:29,410
During Iona's cat
role-playing,

00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,521
did, uh, she ever express

00:14:30,521 --> 00:14:32,515
a desire to get eaten
by a mountain lion?

00:14:32,515 --> 00:14:33,517
Because that's how she died.

00:14:33,517 --> 00:14:37,084
See for yourself.

00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:38,953
I worked with Iona
for several months.

00:14:38,953 --> 00:14:40,254
She was making
progress--

00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:43,324
finally able to demand
and receive affection.

00:14:43,324 --> 00:14:45,092
So, I suggested
she bring

00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:46,827
her boyfriend Carter
to a session.

00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,518
(meowing)

00:14:50,518 --> 00:14:51,832
LADY HEATHER:
Carter, why don't you stroke

00:14:51,832 --> 00:14:53,521
the kitty's head, show her

00:14:53,521 --> 00:14:54,521
how beautiful she is?

00:14:54,521 --> 00:14:56,521
(mewing)

00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:03,110
(Iona purring)

00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,513
It was a productive session.

00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,513
Until the end.

00:15:09,516 --> 00:15:11,151
LADY HEATHER:
Excellent.
(meows)

00:15:11,151 --> 00:15:14,188
Excellent. We'll pick
this up next week.

00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,126
The session's over.

00:15:20,522 --> 00:15:22,514
Iona?

00:15:24,365 --> 00:15:26,133
(snarls, hisses)

00:15:27,935 --> 00:15:30,437
Iona, whatever you're
hiding from in there,

00:15:30,437 --> 00:15:33,515
you have to come
out and face it.

00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:36,410
Come on, this is nuts.

00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:38,519
Let's go.
(hisses)

00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:41,248
Let's go, Iona!

00:15:41,248 --> 00:15:43,317
CARTER:
Ow! God... Babe?

00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:47,388
That was the last time
I saw Iona.

00:15:47,388 --> 00:15:50,090
She never came back,
never returned my calls.

00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:53,060
If you'd like, I have her
boyfriend's contact information.

00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,029
I loved Iona.

00:15:55,029 --> 00:15:56,522
You two lived together?

00:15:56,522 --> 00:16:00,167
Till six weeks ago.
Then she just took off.

00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:03,404
I blame that Dr. Kessler.
She used to be a dominatrix.

00:16:03,404 --> 00:16:06,516
I mean, how the hell does a
woman like that get a license?

00:16:07,513 --> 00:16:10,210
(sighs)

00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:13,522
Look, I know this could get me
in trouble, but...

00:16:13,522 --> 00:16:18,319
I wanted to help Iona, so...
I busted into her place.

00:16:18,319 --> 00:16:21,021
I didn't find her...

00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:25,893
...but I found these.

00:16:25,893 --> 00:16:26,894
(clears throat)

00:16:26,894 --> 00:16:28,395
Bondage thing or
something.

00:16:28,395 --> 00:16:31,432
That's what that shrink
got her into-- I was gonna go

00:16:31,432 --> 00:16:33,522
down to her office and
throw those in her face.

00:16:58,292 --> 00:16:59,960
(sighs)

00:17:11,515 --> 00:17:13,207
What a mess.

00:17:13,207 --> 00:17:15,342
Looks like a man's belt.

00:17:16,522 --> 00:17:19,514
I heard that Maria's mom didn't
want to see the baby.

00:17:19,514 --> 00:17:22,518
No. No, she didn't.

00:17:33,994 --> 00:17:35,295
I got a computer here.

00:17:38,513 --> 00:17:41,517
I may have just found the
father, or part of him at least.

00:17:41,517 --> 00:17:43,470
Tuxedo.

00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:45,039
"Homecoming King."

00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,473
Probably went to school
together.

00:17:46,473 --> 00:17:48,008
Pregnant 17-year-old.

00:17:48,008 --> 00:17:49,513
Clueless mom.

00:17:49,513 --> 00:17:52,517
Manhandled before she died.
And either she hung herself

00:17:52,517 --> 00:17:55,949
or whoever roughed her up
wanted to make us think that.

00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:57,351
(phone chimes)

00:18:02,522 --> 00:18:04,358
(chiming)

00:18:08,362 --> 00:18:10,516
What kind of language is that?

00:18:10,516 --> 00:18:11,519
It's called "Eleet Speak."

00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:13,514
Text and e-mail language
comprised

00:18:13,514 --> 00:18:15,522
primarily of acronyms
and abbreviation.

00:18:15,522 --> 00:18:19,106
I know "LOL," "LMAO,"
how to wink.

00:18:19,106 --> 00:18:21,408
That's about it; I don't
even know what this is.

00:18:21,408 --> 00:18:23,521
Eh, youth culture, my friend.

00:18:23,521 --> 00:18:26,113
It's definitely a heavy
conversation going on here

00:18:26,113 --> 00:18:28,916
between Maria and Nculver12.

00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:31,520
Culver could be the last name.
First name could start with "N."

00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,388
"Nculver12" was the last person
to text Maria before she died,

00:18:34,388 --> 00:18:36,423
(chiming continues)
and they keep coming in.

00:18:36,423 --> 00:18:38,522
These are coming
in as we speak?
Yeah.

00:18:38,522 --> 00:18:41,517
Well, what's "LMIRL"?

00:18:41,517 --> 00:18:45,517
"Let's meet in real life."
"KPC"-- "Keep parents clueless."

00:18:45,517 --> 00:18:47,901
"Meet in person."
"Keep parents clueless."

00:18:47,901 --> 00:18:49,870
Could be
the Homecoming King.

00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,405
Well, one thing's for sure in
the digital age--

00:18:51,405 --> 00:18:53,207
every keystroke's permanent.

00:18:53,207 --> 00:18:55,514
Give me a few hours with this,
I'll give you her whole life.

00:18:55,514 --> 00:18:58,112
Nculver12's a good place
to start.

00:18:58,112 --> 00:19:00,481
HODGES:
Ah, a little chamomile.

00:19:00,481 --> 00:19:02,519
I imagine the sparks between you

00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:04,516
and Dr. Lady
Heather were flying.

00:19:04,516 --> 00:19:06,517
I'm sure you dominated.
Do you have something for me?

00:19:06,517 --> 00:19:08,055
Yes, um...

00:19:08,055 --> 00:19:09,519
so, about your broken
lion's tooth--

00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:11,521
turns out that
it's neither.

00:19:11,521 --> 00:19:13,521
Not from a lion,
not even a real tooth.

00:19:13,521 --> 00:19:15,295
It's prosthetic
and synthetic.

00:19:15,295 --> 00:19:17,164
A fake tabby tooth?

00:19:17,164 --> 00:19:19,166
Made with the same
polymethacrylate formula

00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:21,268
used by all dentists,
but this tooth

00:19:21,268 --> 00:19:24,037
featured specific feline
characteristics.

00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:26,516
Which sent me on the hunt for
veterinary dentists.

00:19:26,516 --> 00:19:29,243
And?
It seems that there's only
one Dental Dolittle

00:19:29,243 --> 00:19:31,521
in the Vegas area who's doing
this kind of work.

00:19:31,521 --> 00:19:34,519
Dr. Tyrell Neth.
Summerlin.

00:19:36,521 --> 00:19:39,521
(music playing in distance)

00:19:47,027 --> 00:19:48,521
Someone's
having a party.

00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,397
Well, they won't mind
if we crash.

00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:51,513
(doorbell rings)

00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,836
Good evening.
May I help you?

00:19:55,836 --> 00:19:57,437
Dr. Tyrell Neth?

00:19:57,437 --> 00:19:58,438
Yes.

00:19:58,438 --> 00:20:00,517
I'm CSI Langston,
this is CSI Sidle.

00:20:00,517 --> 00:20:02,342
We're from the
Vegas Crime Lab.

00:20:02,342 --> 00:20:05,345
We'd like to ask you a few
questions about Iona Vail.

00:20:05,345 --> 00:20:07,247
Certainly.

00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:08,248
Can we come in?

00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:10,317
(chuckles)

00:20:10,317 --> 00:20:11,522
By all means.

00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,988
I hope you like animals.

00:20:14,988 --> 00:20:16,519

They prevent any bipedal

Oh, I assure you,

00:21:10,653 --> 00:21:13,490
what goes on here
is all quite healthy

00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:15,762
and, for the lack
of a better word...

00:21:15,762 --> 00:21:17,227
natural.

00:21:17,227 --> 00:21:18,757
How about consensual?

00:21:18,757 --> 00:21:20,597
All the restraints are
self-releasing.

00:21:20,597 --> 00:21:22,761
My pets choose to be here.

00:21:22,761 --> 00:21:24,334
Your pets?

00:21:24,334 --> 00:21:26,761
My friends and I find comfort
from their affection.

00:21:29,105 --> 00:21:30,758
Your human pets.

00:21:30,758 --> 00:21:33,276
The idea of animal
transformation--

00:21:33,276 --> 00:21:36,412
therianthropy-- is as ancient as
mankind itself.

00:21:36,412 --> 00:21:39,249
In native cultures, young males

00:21:39,249 --> 00:21:41,484
gain an animal spirit
at puberty.

00:21:41,484 --> 00:21:45,355
Often, the initiate must kill
his spirit animal,

00:21:45,355 --> 00:21:48,491
consume it as a rite of passage.

00:21:48,491 --> 00:21:50,059
LANGSTON:
Yes, I'm familiar

00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:52,228
with the concept,
but my understanding

00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:54,430
of therianthropy is
that it's fleeting,

00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:56,763
it's meant to be symbolic.

00:21:56,763 --> 00:21:59,761
In many cultures, the notion
of retaining the shape

00:21:59,761 --> 00:22:04,574
of the beast is seen as
nothing less than a curse.

00:22:04,574 --> 00:22:07,076
Cat got your tongue?

00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:10,146
Maybe you could loosen it enough
to tell us about Iona Vail.

00:22:10,146 --> 00:22:11,759
Iona was a creature of habit.

00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:15,418
When she wasn't curled up
at the foot of my couch,

00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:18,521
she was outside...
in the pine tree.

00:22:18,521 --> 00:22:20,657
Iona was living here?
As a cat?

00:22:20,657 --> 00:22:22,763
For the past six weeks, yes.

00:22:22,763 --> 00:22:24,327
LANGSTON:
And then what happened?

00:22:24,327 --> 00:22:26,129
She ran away.

00:22:26,129 --> 00:22:27,630
Total mystery.

00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:29,666
Oh, I have a theory.

00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:32,758
Life in the gilded cage wasn't
everything that Iona hoped for.

00:22:32,758 --> 00:22:35,238
There were constraints,
demands,

00:22:35,238 --> 00:22:36,757
expectations.

00:22:36,757 --> 00:22:38,757
Oh, I'm not intimate
with my pets.

00:22:38,757 --> 00:22:40,760
No? Then what do you get
out of the relationship?

00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:44,681
Affection, loyalty, gratitude.

00:22:44,681 --> 00:22:47,759
Qualities I find
sorely lacking in
human society.

00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:52,188
And this house, while certainly
gilded, is no cage.

00:22:52,188 --> 00:22:55,391
The animals can come
and go as they please.

00:22:55,391 --> 00:22:58,757
I have a warrant here,
Dr. Neth...

00:22:58,757 --> 00:23:00,630
that allows us to go

00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:03,066
where we please.

00:23:03,066 --> 00:23:05,435
SIDLE: How does someone
who runs a woman's shelter

00:23:05,435 --> 00:23:07,763
end up with a
guy like Neth?
Good question.

00:23:07,763 --> 00:23:10,763
Looks like Iona's pine tree.

00:23:10,763 --> 00:23:12,763
(sighs)

00:23:15,211 --> 00:23:17,080
Gouge marks in the bark.

00:23:19,482 --> 00:23:21,755
Human-sized disturbance
in the needles.

00:23:21,755 --> 00:23:23,764
I think she took a hard fall.

00:23:23,764 --> 00:23:26,122
(hisses)
...right now! You get back
in that house!

00:23:26,122 --> 00:23:27,290
(bone cracks)

00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:29,559
That would explain her
compression fracture.

00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:31,294
Neth's looking for a
little affection.

00:23:31,294 --> 00:23:33,463
Iona just wants to
hang out in her tree,

00:23:33,463 --> 00:23:36,099
so Neth breaks out a stun gun.

00:23:36,099 --> 00:23:38,760
<i>He stuns her, drags her...</i>

00:23:44,307 --> 00:23:46,755
I think she left something
behind.

00:23:49,078 --> 00:23:51,757
Same color and material
as her cat suit.

00:23:54,764 --> 00:23:57,762
I wonder if Neth dumps
all his ungrateful animals

00:23:57,762 --> 00:23:59,155
back into the wild.

00:23:59,155 --> 00:24:00,762
(growling)
Wow!
Easy.

00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:03,192
Really?

00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:05,595
(growling continues)

00:24:07,757 --> 00:24:09,762
He's got the same burn marks
we found on Iona.

She's my girlfriend.<i>Wasyour girlfriend.</i>

Excuse me, are you bringing
everyone in from the school,

00:24:25,415 --> 00:24:27,183
or just my kid?
Just your kid.

00:24:27,183 --> 00:24:28,618
Nathan, is this you?

00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:31,688
Yeah, that's my son.

00:24:31,688 --> 00:24:32,757
He's the Homecoming King.

00:24:32,757 --> 00:24:33,762
He's also an honor student.

00:24:33,762 --> 00:24:37,756
What can you tell us
about these text messages?

00:24:37,756 --> 00:24:40,763
"LMIRL"? "KPC"? What is that?

00:24:40,763 --> 00:24:43,762
"Let's meet in real life."
"Keep parents clueless."

00:24:43,762 --> 00:24:45,301
Why would you want to have

00:24:45,301 --> 00:24:47,761
a meeting with her and keep
your parents out of it?

00:24:47,761 --> 00:24:49,757
Can I talk to you guys
in private?

00:24:49,757 --> 00:24:51,374
Nathan, you can tell
these officers

00:24:51,374 --> 00:24:53,755
and me exactly what the deal is
with you and this girl.

00:24:56,145 --> 00:24:57,447
I got her pregnant.

00:24:58,715 --> 00:25:01,584
We... we hid it
from everyone.

00:25:01,584 --> 00:25:03,764
She was gonna have my baby
in a couple of weeks.

00:25:05,288 --> 00:25:07,190
Nathan, are you kidding me?!

00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:10,660
You just had to keep your
nose clean for one more year,

00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:13,763
get that scholarship and
then you had it made, son.

00:25:13,763 --> 00:25:16,756
And what,
you're telling me that, uh,

00:25:16,756 --> 00:25:18,601
this girl and her baby--
they're dead?

00:25:18,601 --> 00:25:20,755
The baby's not dead.
The baby's in the hospital.

00:25:20,755 --> 00:25:22,372
And that's lucky
for you, Nate.

00:25:22,372 --> 00:25:24,540
Otherwise, you'd be on the
hook for a double homicide.

00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,760
Homicide?
Yeah, homicide.

00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,212
I would never hurt Maria.
We loved each other.

00:25:32,758 --> 00:25:35,351
Is that your belt?
Yeah, it's my belt.

00:25:35,351 --> 00:25:37,320
I left it at
Maria's a while ago.

00:25:38,758 --> 00:25:40,759
What can you tell me
about those bruises?

00:25:42,756 --> 00:25:45,161
Were you at Maria's
house this morning?

00:25:45,161 --> 00:25:46,562
Yeah.

00:25:47,763 --> 00:25:50,757
I came over after her
mom left for work.

00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:52,763
You said you wanted the baby.

00:25:52,763 --> 00:25:55,271
You were going to
take care of me.
You promised.

00:25:55,271 --> 00:25:58,756
I know. I'm sorry, all right?
But think about it, Maria.

00:25:58,756 --> 00:26:00,209
It's only gonna ruin our lives.

00:26:00,209 --> 00:26:02,645
I'm not going to get
my scholarship.

00:26:02,645 --> 00:26:04,514
And without it, I can't
afford to go to college.

00:26:04,514 --> 00:26:06,649
Why didn't you tell me this
eight and a half months ago?

00:26:06,649 --> 00:26:09,152
I'm keeping the baby!
No, you're not!

00:26:09,152 --> 00:26:10,586
Ow! You're hurting me.
I don't want it!

00:26:10,586 --> 00:26:11,761
So you did grab her.

00:26:11,761 --> 00:26:14,490
Then what were you gonna do?
String her up with the belt

00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:16,692
and try to make it
look like a suicide?

00:26:16,692 --> 00:26:18,755
No! We had a fight and I left.
I went to school.

00:26:18,755 --> 00:26:20,563
Ask anyone in first period.
Enough!

00:26:20,563 --> 00:26:22,632
We know you were in your room
when she hung herself.

00:26:22,632 --> 00:26:25,635
You admitted that's your
belt, and we know you
were grabbing on her.

00:26:25,635 --> 00:26:26,763
BRASS:
Grabbing, belt, sex,

00:26:26,763 --> 00:26:30,106
baby, scholarship-- motive.

00:26:30,106 --> 00:26:32,759
You see what this
looks like?

00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:34,610
Nathan, scholarship
land's over, dude.

00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:37,280
You're on the hook
for murder here.

00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,148
Now, if you didn't
kill her,

00:26:39,148 --> 00:26:42,418
you better damn sure help us
find out who did, you hear me?

00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,621
So, who else would
want to hurt her?

00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:52,094
Everyone.

00:26:56,299 --> 00:26:58,534
Maria received over a thousand
e-mails just today,

00:26:58,534 --> 00:26:59,761
and twice that by text.

00:26:59,761 --> 00:27:01,759
They've been coming in
for months.

00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:04,307
She tried to delete them all,
and just couldn't keep up.

00:27:04,307 --> 00:27:06,758
So, I tracked the cyber
footprints on her devices,

00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:09,145
and it led me to this.

00:27:09,145 --> 00:27:11,547
Hate mail was just
the beginning.

00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:15,759
EKCLIE: MariaIsABitch.com.
What, a hate site?

00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,687
Yeah. Check this out.

00:27:18,454 --> 00:27:20,389
I'm a slut!

00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:22,592
I'm a ho.

00:27:22,592 --> 00:27:24,393
What does that spell?

00:27:24,393 --> 00:27:26,760
"W-H-O-R-E!"

00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,130
Turn it off. I've seen enough.

00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:30,756
Maria went viral
with a click of a button.

00:27:30,756 --> 00:27:33,536
We're talking 11 million
hits in 18 hours.

00:27:33,536 --> 00:27:36,756
She's been getting a
constant flow of messages
via text and e-mail.

00:27:36,756 --> 00:27:38,759
From all over the world?
Mm-hmm.

00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:41,277
It's the power of the
world wide web.
(e-mail chiming)

00:27:41,277 --> 00:27:43,446
She's been dead a day.

00:27:43,446 --> 00:27:45,715
She's still
getting messages.
You know, Conrad,

00:27:45,715 --> 00:27:48,184
even if the evidence tells me
this girl took her own life,

00:27:48,184 --> 00:27:49,685
I still consider this
to be murder.

00:27:49,685 --> 00:27:51,758
Well, how do you
figure that, Nick?

00:27:51,758 --> 00:27:54,423
She was bullied.
Yeah. Cyber-bullied.

00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:56,762
Look, it's not like back
in the days of getting
your lunch money stolen,

00:27:56,762 --> 00:27:58,762
or getting tripped
in the hallway.

00:27:58,762 --> 00:28:01,564
11 million people bombarded
this girl with hate,

00:28:01,564 --> 00:28:03,566
and it drove her
to take her own life.

00:28:03,566 --> 00:28:05,668
What do you want to do?
These people are on line, Nick.

00:28:05,668 --> 00:28:07,503
We're not going to get
11 million arrest warrants.

00:28:07,503 --> 00:28:10,373
I know that, Conrad, but I do
feel like some of the kids

00:28:10,373 --> 00:28:12,760
at this school are responsible,
and I want to pursue that.

00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:16,445
Listen, you weren't there when
Robbins delivered that baby.

00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:18,381
Maria and her child deserve
some justice,

00:28:18,381 --> 00:28:20,283
and we're obligated
to give it to her.

00:28:20,283 --> 00:28:23,758
Okay, but like anything
forensic, I need proof.

00:28:23,758 --> 00:28:26,522
We know how it ended,
but how did it start?

00:28:26,522 --> 00:28:28,391
Get me names,
and prove to me

00:28:28,391 --> 00:28:31,327
that an honor student,
soon-to-be father, didn't kill

00:28:31,327 --> 00:28:33,162
Maria Diorio with
his own belt.

00:28:33,162 --> 00:28:35,298
Do that and I will
go to bat for you.

00:28:35,298 --> 00:28:36,762
All right.

00:28:38,701 --> 00:28:40,760
Every keystroke's
permanent, right?
Right.

00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,760
Give me all the hate mail linked
to that high school.

00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:46,676
STOKES:
Hey.
Hey.

00:28:46,676 --> 00:28:48,611
Did you go home for lunch?

00:28:48,611 --> 00:28:50,759
No. I went over
to the NIC Unit

00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:53,249
to visit our baby girl.
Oh,yeah? How's she doing?

00:28:53,249 --> 00:28:55,217
She's off the respirator,
breathing on her own now.

00:28:55,217 --> 00:28:57,119
Good.

00:28:57,119 --> 00:28:58,762
Nurse told me I was her
only visitor.

00:29:01,624 --> 00:29:03,757
Did you have a chance
to work out a timeline yet?

00:29:03,757 --> 00:29:04,763
Yeah, I just finished.

00:29:04,763 --> 00:29:08,564
Maria died at 9:30 a.m.

00:29:08,564 --> 00:29:10,761
Baby was alive.
That puts T.O.D.

00:29:10,761 --> 00:29:12,763
no more than
15 minutes earlier.

00:29:12,763 --> 00:29:15,758
Okay, Brass confirmed that
Nathan Culver was at school

00:29:15,758 --> 00:29:18,240
at 8:30, so the only way
he could've killed Maria

00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,763
is if he strung her up
with his own belt

00:29:19,763 --> 00:29:21,711
sometime before that.

00:29:21,711 --> 00:29:25,348
Could it have taken her
45 minutes to die?

00:29:25,348 --> 00:29:28,718
Given the absence of ligature
marks around her neck--

00:29:28,718 --> 00:29:30,386
impossible.

00:29:30,386 --> 00:29:32,622
Nathan didn't kill her.

00:29:32,622 --> 00:29:35,491
LANGSTON:<i>I just spent an hour</i>
<i>talking to a man</i>

00:29:35,491 --> 00:29:36,757
who think he's a dog.

00:29:36,757 --> 00:29:38,761
You ask the man a question,
he barks back at you.

00:29:38,761 --> 00:29:42,264
A year ago, this guy was the
manager of a hot dog chain.

00:29:42,264 --> 00:29:45,267
And what conclusion
do you draw from that?

00:29:45,267 --> 00:29:47,470
Well, either he's hiding
behind his animal mask,

00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:49,372
or Neth has
got him brainwashed.

00:29:49,372 --> 00:29:51,762
I think that might be a little
simplistic, Doctor.

00:29:51,762 --> 00:29:55,277
All your assumptions are
based on one false premise.

00:29:55,277 --> 00:29:56,379
Which is?

00:29:56,379 --> 00:29:58,314
You attribute
all the power to Neth.

00:29:58,314 --> 00:29:59,382
He is the master.

00:29:59,382 --> 00:30:00,383
It is his house.

00:30:00,383 --> 00:30:01,384
They are his pets.

00:30:01,384 --> 00:30:02,652
His rules.

00:30:02,652 --> 00:30:04,720
But a king is nothing without
his subjects.

00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,522
They define him, elevate him.

00:30:06,522 --> 00:30:09,425
Without them, he's just a man.

00:30:13,195 --> 00:30:14,563
You're saying that the
relationship

00:30:14,563 --> 00:30:15,758
is more equal than it seems?

00:30:15,758 --> 00:30:18,200
It's a bond of reciprocity.

00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,403
Tyrell gets affection,
his pets get shelter.

00:30:20,403 --> 00:30:21,764
It's like the
bond between

00:30:21,764 --> 00:30:24,707
dominant and submissive,

00:30:24,707 --> 00:30:27,343
hunter and hunted.

00:30:31,147 --> 00:30:32,761
I watch the news, Doctor.

00:30:32,761 --> 00:30:36,762
I even read the
transcripts of your trial.

00:30:36,762 --> 00:30:38,654
Who do you think Nate Haskell

00:30:38,654 --> 00:30:40,758
was performing for
in that courtroom?

00:30:40,758 --> 00:30:44,660
It wasn't the judge
or the jury.

00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,629
I can help.

00:30:46,629 --> 00:30:50,366
No, thank you, Dr. Kessler.

00:30:50,366 --> 00:30:53,169
You've answered
my questions.

00:30:53,169 --> 00:30:55,438
Then I guess we're done here.

00:30:58,758 --> 00:31:00,476
For now.

00:31:07,764 --> 00:31:09,755
SIDLE:
Hey, Dr. Ray.

00:31:09,755 --> 00:31:12,759
I was searching Neth's stables.
Aside from a few human ponies,

00:31:12,759 --> 00:31:14,156
guess what I found.

00:31:14,156 --> 00:31:16,755
Our smoking stun gun.

00:31:29,761 --> 00:31:31,674
♪ ♪

00:31:40,683 --> 00:31:42,384
(zapping)

00:31:59,602 --> 00:32:02,171
HODGES: This itty-bitty piece of
cat suit that you recovered

00:32:02,171 --> 00:32:04,406
from the sprinkler head
on Neth's property

00:32:04,406 --> 00:32:06,763
was a no-go for trace,

00:32:06,763 --> 00:32:09,759
but a go-go for something
very interesting.

00:32:13,761 --> 00:32:14,761
(beep)

00:32:16,352 --> 00:32:17,486
Ridge detail.

00:32:17,486 --> 00:32:18,487
Could be our killer's.

00:32:18,487 --> 00:32:20,589
I went on a
shopping spree,

00:32:20,589 --> 00:32:22,258
and I found just what I was
looking for.

00:32:22,258 --> 00:32:24,460
That's a lovely use of your
personal time.

00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,757
(zapping)
Hey!

00:32:25,757 --> 00:32:28,430
You'd be surprised how many
models of stun guns

00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:30,499
there are out there. Iona and
the Doberman were burnt

00:32:30,499 --> 00:32:33,235
with the same type of stun gun,
but it wasn't Neth's.

00:32:33,235 --> 00:32:35,504
His had a width of
five centimeters.

00:32:35,504 --> 00:32:39,275
The burns were consistent with
this-- it's a PXY-2300--

00:32:39,275 --> 00:32:41,310
which has a width of four
centimeters.

00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:43,312
Only two retail outlets make
this model.

00:32:43,312 --> 00:32:44,758
Iona purchased one last year,

00:32:44,758 --> 00:32:46,757
and she registered it
with the manufacturer.

00:32:46,757 --> 00:32:48,758
She was attacked
with her own stun gun?

00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:50,755
Maybe she bought it for
protection at work.

00:32:50,755 --> 00:32:51,763
Or closer to home.

00:32:51,763 --> 00:32:53,455
I don't think her boyfriend

00:32:53,455 --> 00:32:54,762
was too happy about
her moving out.

00:32:56,158 --> 00:32:57,757
Let's see if he put
his hands on her.

00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:25,759
(sighs heavily)

00:33:27,489 --> 00:33:29,692
You know, the Iona
who started the shelter,

00:33:29,692 --> 00:33:33,329
who saved me from my husband,

00:33:33,329 --> 00:33:35,064
she would have died before

00:33:35,064 --> 00:33:38,367
she let herself be
some pervert's cat.

00:33:38,367 --> 00:33:40,202
So I was just trying

00:33:40,202 --> 00:33:41,763
to bring her back.

00:33:41,763 --> 00:33:43,239
So you subdued her

00:33:43,239 --> 00:33:45,755
with her own stun gun,
threw her into a car,

00:33:45,755 --> 00:33:46,759
and then beat her up.

00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:48,755
I had to get her out of there.

00:33:48,755 --> 00:33:50,479
I mean, it was for her own good!

00:33:50,479 --> 00:33:52,758
Usually, when people say
they're doing something

00:33:52,758 --> 00:33:54,250
for the good of others,

00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:56,452
that usually means
they're doing it for themselves.

00:33:59,321 --> 00:34:01,690
(zapping)

00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:02,760
DEBRA:
Iona!

00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,761
<i>It was like she had been</i>
<i>brainwashed.</i>

00:34:04,761 --> 00:34:06,695
Iona, come on!

00:34:06,695 --> 00:34:08,097
I'm here to help you.

00:34:08,097 --> 00:34:09,531
(hisses)

00:34:09,531 --> 00:34:10,199
Iona!

00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:13,202
(zapping)

00:34:18,374 --> 00:34:20,242
(voice breaking):
I wanted her

00:34:20,242 --> 00:34:21,310
to be grateful.

00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:24,762
I wanted her to cry in my arms.

00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:29,251
I wanted to rescue her
like she rescued me.

00:34:29,251 --> 00:34:31,553
But she didn't want
to be rescued.

00:34:33,763 --> 00:34:35,591
Iona, what did they do to you?

00:34:35,591 --> 00:34:38,093
(hisses)
What is wrong with you?!

00:34:38,093 --> 00:34:41,297
Stop it! I'm just
trying to help you!

00:34:45,763 --> 00:34:47,102
Iona!

00:34:47,102 --> 00:34:48,764
If you really wanted
to save her,

00:34:48,764 --> 00:34:51,761
Debra, why didn't
you call 911?

00:34:51,761 --> 00:34:53,761
I thought she was dead.

00:34:53,761 --> 00:34:59,248
When you have lived
in fear for so long,

00:34:59,248 --> 00:35:04,755
protecting yourself is all
you could think about.

00:35:04,755 --> 00:35:06,764
I'll tell you what I think.

00:35:06,764 --> 00:35:10,125
Iona didn't want
to be a cat forever.

00:35:10,125 --> 00:35:12,561
She just wanted to be
treated like one for
a little while.

00:35:12,561 --> 00:35:13,763
She wanted to be
taken care of

00:35:13,763 --> 00:35:16,757
the way she had taken care
of so many other people.

00:35:16,757 --> 00:35:20,135
So why didn't she just say that?

00:35:20,135 --> 00:35:23,761
Some people...

00:35:23,761 --> 00:35:26,075
just can't ask for help.

00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:30,763
They don't know how.

00:35:36,763 --> 00:35:39,488
JOHNSON:
I can tell you about the events
leading up to Maria's death

00:35:39,488 --> 00:35:40,761
without even having
to talk to anybody.

00:35:40,761 --> 00:35:42,558
All started eight-and-a-half
months ago.

00:35:42,558 --> 00:35:43,763
That's right around
the same time

00:35:43,763 --> 00:35:45,227
Maria started seeing
Nathan Culver.

00:35:45,227 --> 00:35:46,756
Well, it all started
with Nathan.

00:35:46,756 --> 00:35:48,761
He was dating
a homecoming queen.

00:35:48,761 --> 00:35:50,632
Then, one day,
he sees Maria.

00:35:52,501 --> 00:35:55,471
CATHY: For homecoming,
we should coordinate
our colors so we match.

00:35:57,473 --> 00:35:59,758
What are you looking at?!

00:35:59,758 --> 00:36:01,510
A couple days later,
asks for her number,

00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:03,512
texts a bunch of
"I'm thinking about you's."

00:36:03,512 --> 00:36:04,646
Next thing you know,

00:36:04,646 --> 00:36:07,116
Nathan dumps the homecoming
queen by SMS...

00:36:07,116 --> 00:36:10,085
one week before the big dance.

00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:11,553
Cathy Mackey.

00:36:11,553 --> 00:36:14,763
Now, Cathy and her two BFFs
don't like that too much.

00:36:14,763 --> 00:36:16,125
STOKES:
Popular girls,

00:36:16,125 --> 00:36:17,762
cheerleaders,
I see where this is going.

00:36:17,762 --> 00:36:19,361
All three of
them had some

00:36:19,361 --> 00:36:20,760
pretty nasty things
to say to Maria.

00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,664
But it didn't stop there.

00:36:22,664 --> 00:36:24,466
And that's how

00:36:24,466 --> 00:36:26,755
Maria's cheerleading tryout
video got uploaded.

00:36:26,755 --> 00:36:27,764
The girls had access.

00:36:27,764 --> 00:36:29,538
I see where this is going, too.

00:36:29,538 --> 00:36:31,140
It's a dogpile.

00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,307
Not long after, the girls

00:36:32,307 --> 00:36:33,542
started doctoring up photos
of Maria

00:36:33,542 --> 00:36:34,757
and circulating
them around the school,

00:36:34,757 --> 00:36:37,546
which led to
their suspension.

00:36:37,546 --> 00:36:39,648
So the school knew this
was going on.

00:36:39,648 --> 00:36:41,760
According to Maria's e-mails,

00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,755
the principal found
the photos offensive.

00:36:43,755 --> 00:36:45,120
The girls were suspended,

00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,688
which led
to their being ineligible

00:36:46,688 --> 00:36:48,524
for the national cheerleading
competition.

00:36:48,524 --> 00:36:50,125
I'm sure that
didn't go over too well.

00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:51,757
That's when the
piling on escalated

00:36:51,757 --> 00:36:53,755
from a school level
to a global level.

00:36:53,755 --> 00:36:56,465
Texts and hate mails
weren't enough.

00:36:56,465 --> 00:36:58,367
They wanted to drive
the knife deeper.

00:36:58,367 --> 00:37:00,764
(girls laughing)

00:37:00,764 --> 00:37:02,757
Watch this.

00:37:03,762 --> 00:37:06,575
(donkey brays, girls laugh)

00:37:07,643 --> 00:37:10,646
(text alerts sounding)

00:37:10,646 --> 00:37:13,649
(mocking laughter echoing)

00:37:24,493 --> 00:37:28,464
So the video goes viral, and
Maria becomes a laughingstock.

00:37:28,464 --> 00:37:31,763
Her father's dead, her mom's
got her own thing going on,

00:37:31,763 --> 00:37:33,669
and she had no one
else to turn to.

00:37:33,669 --> 00:37:34,761
She's pregnant,

00:37:34,761 --> 00:37:37,757
and the boyfriend turns his back
on her and the baby.

00:37:37,757 --> 00:37:40,642
And she just broke.

00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:43,378
(mocking voice echoing)

00:37:43,378 --> 00:37:45,760
(on video):
...O-R-E...

00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,382
What does that spell?

00:37:47,382 --> 00:37:50,757
W-H-O-R-E!

00:37:50,757 --> 00:37:51,761
Slut!

00:37:51,761 --> 00:37:53,760
(mocking voices
overlapping, echoing)

00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,190
(sobbing)

00:38:12,508 --> 00:38:15,611
STOKES: We might as well be
staring at mug shots here.

00:38:15,611 --> 00:38:17,762
These girls are
the real killers.

00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:21,383
WOMAN:
It's so tragic what
happened to Maria.

00:38:21,383 --> 00:38:22,763
None of these girls
are bad kids.

00:38:22,763 --> 00:38:24,586
They're just kids.

00:38:24,586 --> 00:38:25,763
Regardless,
Ms. Johnson,

00:38:25,763 --> 00:38:28,490
they're responsible for
the death of Maria Diorio.

00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:30,592
It's time to teach
these kidsa lesson.

00:38:30,592 --> 00:38:32,427
We're sending a message:
You send hate,

00:38:32,427 --> 00:38:33,758
you go to jail.

00:39:16,438 --> 00:39:17,761
ECKLIE:
<i>I'm a father. I got kids.</i>

00:39:17,761 --> 00:39:20,108
Where were the parents
during all this?

00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:21,610
Probably working.
Trying to get by.

00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:22,711
Hoping that,
eventually, one day,

00:39:22,711 --> 00:39:23,763
their kids will come up

00:39:23,763 --> 00:39:26,181
and talk to them,
which never happens.

00:39:26,181 --> 00:39:27,762
Well, whether the law agrees
with me or not,

00:39:27,762 --> 00:39:28,764
I think the parents had

00:39:28,764 --> 00:39:30,761
a responsibility here.

00:39:30,761 --> 00:39:32,761
I agree, but you want to talk
about responsibility?

00:39:32,761 --> 00:39:34,758
What about the 11 million people
that watched a video

00:39:34,758 --> 00:39:35,761
that they shouldn't have?

00:39:35,761 --> 00:39:37,762
What's the law gonna
do about that?

00:39:37,762 --> 00:39:40,128
Good question.

00:39:42,756 --> 00:39:44,760
There's our girl
right over there.

00:39:45,761 --> 00:39:48,070
(gentle laugh)

00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:51,759
Is that her?

00:39:51,759 --> 00:39:52,759
Right there.

00:39:56,763 --> 00:39:58,614
I heard what you did.

00:39:58,614 --> 00:40:00,515
Thank you.

00:40:00,515 --> 00:40:02,684
You're welcome.
You're welcome.

00:40:02,684 --> 00:40:04,586
You know,
it's not how

00:40:04,586 --> 00:40:06,688
you come into this world
that counts,

00:40:06,688 --> 00:40:09,057
it's how you live it.

00:40:09,057 --> 00:40:11,159
She's beautiful.

00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:12,628
Congratulations.

00:40:18,533 --> 00:40:20,760
What do you think, Nathan?

00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:26,761
I'm scared.

00:40:26,761 --> 00:40:28,763
I mean, I don't know
the first thing about babies.

00:40:30,612 --> 00:40:32,214
She'll let you know
what she needs.

00:40:32,214 --> 00:40:34,683
Come on.

00:40:34,683 --> 00:40:36,652
Come on.
It's all right, man.

00:40:39,254 --> 00:40:42,257
Ladies,

00:40:42,257 --> 00:40:46,094
I'm Nick Stokes.
I'm with the crime lab.

00:40:46,094 --> 00:40:48,763
This young man would like
to hold his daughter,

00:40:48,763 --> 00:40:51,756
if that's all right.

00:40:51,756 --> 00:40:54,369
Why don't you
have a seat, Nathan?

00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:55,758
Sit down right here.

00:41:05,647 --> 00:41:08,116
(baby fusses gently)

00:41:11,763 --> 00:41:15,223
You know, she kinda
looks like you, man.

00:41:16,591 --> 00:41:18,560
Have you thought
of a name yet?

00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,295
Yeah.

00:41:21,761 --> 00:41:23,632
Maria.

00:41:23,632 --> 00:41:25,634
That's a good one.

00:41:34,543 --> 00:41:40,582
LANGSTON: Every file on Nate
Haskell dating back to 1996.

00:41:40,582 --> 00:41:42,250
You said you were
expecting me, Doctor.

00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:43,618
Please don't tell me

00:41:43,618 --> 00:41:45,587
that you've
changed your mind.

00:41:49,157 --> 00:41:50,758
I don't know what you're
fighting, Doctor,

00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,759
but it looks like you're
about to be overrun.

00:41:56,331 --> 00:41:59,167
Nate Haskell is an enemy,

00:41:59,167 --> 00:42:02,170
a formidable enemy,

00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:05,173
but he's not<i>theenemy, is he?</i>

00:42:09,244 --> 00:42:10,759
(sighs deeply)

00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:17,756
When I went for, uh,

00:42:17,756 --> 00:42:21,490
my interview at
med school,

00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:24,192
the first question
they ask you,

00:42:24,192 --> 00:42:26,756
quite naturally, is, "Why
do you want to be a doctor?"

00:42:26,756 --> 00:42:29,264
Well, I can't remember
the answer I prepared,

00:42:29,264 --> 00:42:31,333
but I remember
the one I gave.

00:42:31,333 --> 00:42:35,103
I told them,
"If I'm helping people,

00:42:35,103 --> 00:42:36,371
I'm not hurting them."

00:42:38,407 --> 00:42:41,176
The guy stared at me for what
seemed like a lifetime,

00:42:41,176 --> 00:42:43,078
then he burst out laughing,

00:42:43,078 --> 00:42:44,579
so I started laughing,

00:42:44,579 --> 00:42:46,248
and within a half an hour

00:42:46,248 --> 00:42:50,218
I had secured myself a place
at medical school.

00:42:50,218 --> 00:42:53,255
You had answered truthfully.

00:42:53,255 --> 00:42:55,762
There's violence in me.

00:42:55,762 --> 00:42:57,762
In my blood.

00:42:57,762 --> 00:42:59,528
Sometimes I can taste it.

00:42:59,528 --> 00:43:01,696
But as long as you keep a lid
on it...

00:43:01,696 --> 00:43:05,066
DNA is not destiny-- that's what
I've always told myself.

00:43:05,066 --> 00:43:08,764
I can't answer your question.

00:43:08,764 --> 00:43:11,573
I didn't ask you a question.

00:43:11,573 --> 00:43:13,175
Sure you did.

00:43:13,175 --> 00:43:14,764
Why else did you come here,

00:43:14,764 --> 00:43:16,761
tell me that story?

00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:19,714
Doctor, you want legitimacy.

00:43:19,714 --> 00:43:23,518
You want to know that it's okay
to lose the muzzle for a while.

00:43:26,757 --> 00:43:28,763
I can say this:

00:43:28,763 --> 00:43:33,261
the good Dr. Langston isn't
going to catch Nate Haskell.

00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:43,755
If I give in to my nature,
I won't catch him...

00:43:46,675 --> 00:43:48,759
I will kill him.

00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:50,312
Yes, you will.

00:43:50,312 --> 00:43:52,714
What becomes of me then?
