Mm!

00:00:26,767 --> 00:00:28,867
So what do we got here?
Back away, ma'am.

00:00:28,933 --> 00:00:31,433
We go through the boxes
before the customers do.

(whistles)

00:00:40,467 --> 00:00:44,100
I smell a Gucci bag
in one of these.

00:00:51,867 --> 00:00:53,133
A wig.

00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,500
I could use a wig.

Dead body inside?

00:01:12,607 --> 00:01:13,873
Yeah, but we're not dealing

00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,140
with a full body.

00:01:15,207 --> 00:01:16,473
What do you mean?

00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,307
So far, we have a head
and a foot.

00:01:18,373 --> 00:01:20,140
You know, I actually
shop at this store.

00:01:20,207 --> 00:01:21,973
They have some good stuff.

00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,173
They always sell body parts?

00:01:26,907 --> 00:01:28,173
No leakage.

00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,373
Killer was tidy enough
to wrap the parts in plastic.

00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,107
Rest of him is probably
in these other boxes.

00:01:34,173 --> 00:01:37,007
We're going to have to take
them all back to the lab.

00:01:37,073 --> 00:01:38,707
Were these boxes drop-offs
or pickups?

00:01:38,773 --> 00:01:41,207
Pickups. The manager said
they just came off the truck.

00:01:41,273 --> 00:01:42,840
Where did the truck get them?
All over town.

00:01:42,907 --> 00:01:45,073
They don't keep track of which
box comes from which house,

00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,273
but the store manager
gave me a list of the addresses

00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,107
on the driver's route.
You know,

00:01:49,173 --> 00:01:51,007
I have heard
of donating a body to science.

he worked at the morgue

here.
No.

No, he hasn't had that office
over there for a while now.

Gloria. You wouldn't happen
to be Ray's wife, would you?

00:03:01,513 --> 00:03:03,220
Yeah. Yeah, I'm
Nick Stokes.

00:03:03,287 --> 00:03:04,687
It's nice
to meet you.

00:03:04,753 --> 00:03:06,487
I'll tell you what. Follow
me and I'll take you to him.

Here he is.

00:03:29,087 --> 00:03:32,287
Of course, right now,
he looks a lot more like Dr. Dre

00:03:32,353 --> 00:03:34,253
than Dr. Ray, but...

00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,653
Ray!
Firing two!

00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,887

00:03:36,953 --> 00:03:38,120

Somebody here to see you.

00:03:42,087 --> 00:03:44,020
Gloria.

00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,820
Uh...

00:03:48,887 --> 00:03:49,987
(laughs)

00:03:50,053 --> 00:03:51,520
Hi.

00:03:51,587 --> 00:03:54,220
What a surprise.

00:03:54,287 --> 00:03:58,220
You know, I really have a lot
of work to do, so I'm gonna run.

00:03:58,287 --> 00:04:00,520
It was good to see you. Hope to
see you again, Mrs. Langston.

00:04:00,587 --> 00:04:02,160
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you, too.

00:04:02,227 --> 00:04:03,327
Yeah.

00:04:03,393 --> 00:04:05,360
You got yourself a
really good man here.

00:04:05,427 --> 00:04:07,693
I could really use
your help, Hodges.

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,193
You know, it took him
a little time to warm up,

00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,093
but, uh, now
we're family.

00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,560
Hodges!
What?

00:04:14,627 --> 00:04:15,560
(no voice)

00:04:15,627 --> 00:04:16,627
Excuse me.

00:04:21,627 --> 00:04:23,593
Hi.

00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,760
Nice to see you.

00:04:25,827 --> 00:04:28,093
What part of your job
is this exactly?

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,493
Oh, this car was involved
in a drive-by shooting.

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,860
The occupants said that
they didn't hear any gunshots,

00:04:34,927 --> 00:04:38,227
so we're comparing the
decibel level of the gunfire

00:04:38,293 --> 00:04:40,993
to the decibel level of the
music they were listening to.

00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,593
Sounds like fun.

00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,793
You leave the dead bodies
out of the equation, it is.

00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,693
(laughs)
What...?

00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,560
What brings you to Vegas?

00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,693
I'm getting married.

00:04:58,793 --> 00:05:00,660
Mm.

00:05:00,727 --> 00:05:03,333
I, um... I-I got engaged
a couple of months ago,

00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,333
and I didn't let
you know, and I just...

00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,733
I didn't want to do
the same thing with the wedding.

00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,867
Congratulations.

00:05:10,933 --> 00:05:13,167
We're just gonna, um, do it

00:05:13,233 --> 00:05:15,267
at, like,
a little chapel up the street.

00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:16,700
Nothing fancy.

00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,000
Ray, I know that
you won't come, but

00:05:23,067 --> 00:05:24,867
I'd really like you
to meet Phil.

00:05:24,933 --> 00:05:26,867
(sighs heavily):
Wow.

00:05:28,433 --> 00:05:29,933
I, um...

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,900
still consider you
my best friend.

00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,200
Can I think about it?

00:05:35,267 --> 00:05:37,200
Yeah, of course.

00:05:37,267 --> 00:05:39,100
Where are you staying?

00:05:39,167 --> 00:05:40,500
Uh, at the Eclipse.

00:05:40,567 --> 00:05:42,233
If you... If you
change your mind,

00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,033
why don't you... why don't
you meet us for a drink,

00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,567
at the lounge,
tomorrow night at 8:00?

00:05:47,633 --> 00:05:49,933
I will think about it.

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,067
You look really good.

00:05:52,133 --> 00:05:54,033
Thank you.

00:06:06,273 --> 00:06:08,307
There she is.
Look, look, look.

00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,007
SIDLE:
She's beautiful.

00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:16,073
Well, she's a little bit
different than I expected.

00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,207
I thought she'd be more bookish.
PHILLIPS:
He's been working

00:06:18,273 --> 00:06:20,740
here for two years, and it's
the first time I've seen her.

00:06:20,807 --> 00:06:23,107
Dr. Robbins hasn't even met her,
and they're buddies.

00:06:23,173 --> 00:06:25,373
STOKES: Looks like sand
or dirt in his mouth.

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,840
But the rest
of the head seems pretty clean.

00:06:27,907 --> 00:06:29,840
You know, if he had been buried,

00:06:29,907 --> 00:06:31,873
he'd be covered in dirt.

00:06:33,573 --> 00:06:35,740
Maybe the killer was
trying to shut him up.

00:06:37,807 --> 00:06:39,440
STOKES: There's someone else
in his mouth.

00:06:39,507 --> 00:06:41,007
SIDLE:What?

00:06:41,073 --> 00:06:42,740
Take a look.

00:06:44,407 --> 00:06:45,340
Hmm.

00:06:45,407 --> 00:06:46,673
Bone fragments.

00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,540
Ash...
morphology...

00:06:51,607 --> 00:06:54,673
Cremated
human remains.

00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,673
Cremains.

00:06:57,907 --> 00:06:59,807
(camera shutter clicking)

00:07:21,613 --> 00:07:23,380
(whooshing, crackling)

00:07:36,347 --> 00:07:38,347
Guys?

00:07:38,413 --> 00:07:40,880
Judging by these curved
tool marks,

00:07:40,947 --> 00:07:43,013
some sort of flexible saw
was used.

00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,180
LANGSTON:
Mm-hmm.

00:07:44,247 --> 00:07:45,413
He was four-pointed.
Yeah.

00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:49,013
These marks are too narrow
to be rope or handcuffs.

00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,080
Maybe wire?

00:07:51,147 --> 00:07:53,847
Check out his chest.

00:07:53,913 --> 00:07:55,847
These faint contusions.

00:07:55,913 --> 00:07:58,347
I'll see what I.R.
Photography develops.

00:07:58,413 --> 00:08:00,147
Hear you had
a visitor.

00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:02,453
Yes.

00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,453
I would've liked
to have met her.

00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,853
If I knew she was coming,

00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,487
I would've introduced you
to her.

00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:09,120
Maybe you and Gloria
could come over

00:08:09,187 --> 00:08:10,753
for dinner one night this week.

00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,853
Epiglottis is inflamed.

00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,153
That means he was alive

00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,387
when the cremains
were dropped down the hatch.

00:08:20,453 --> 00:08:25,087
C.O.D. is asphyxia due to
oropharyngeal obstruction.

00:08:25,153 --> 00:08:28,553
Which tells us the cremains
were--the murder weapon.

00:08:29,987 --> 00:08:32,153
There is a message
in there somewhere.

00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,087
You found all
his pieces.

00:08:35,153 --> 00:08:36,287
Yes, we did.

00:08:36,353 --> 00:08:38,387
What's in the
tox report, Henry?

00:08:38,453 --> 00:08:41,987
Well, John Doe was
double-fisting
alcohol and zolpidem.

00:08:42,053 --> 00:08:43,453
LANGSTON:
That's a strong sedative.

00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,753
At these levels, he would've
had to have been comatose

00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,253
when he ingested the cremains.

00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,553
That explains his lack
of injuries to his
lips and tongue.

00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:54,420
So he was unconscious,
the killer tied him up,

00:08:54,487 --> 00:08:56,287
<i>poured the cremains
in his mouth.</i>

00:08:56,353 --> 00:08:59,987
(coughing)
<i>His involuntary gag reflex
opened up his gullet,</i>

00:09:00,053 --> 00:09:01,493
<i>allowing the cremains
to be sucked into his throat,</i>

00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,893
<i>asphyxiating him to death.</i>

00:09:04,793 --> 00:09:07,493
Why would anyone ever choose
to end up like this?

00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,027
Money.

00:09:09,093 --> 00:09:11,260
Cremation's fast and cheap.

00:09:11,327 --> 00:09:13,560
Yeah, well, I'll fork
out the extra dollars

00:09:13,627 --> 00:09:14,993
to go six feet under.

00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,193
I don't like the idea
of being portable.

00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,660
In a vase,

00:09:18,727 --> 00:09:21,560
being passed around
from relative to relative.

00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:23,360
No, I'm gonna get a tombstone.

00:09:23,427 --> 00:09:27,127
Something that someone
can worship me at. Hmm.

00:09:27,193 --> 00:09:30,193
So, we got
pieces of bone.

00:09:33,293 --> 00:09:34,627
A surgical screw.

00:09:36,627 --> 00:09:40,093
And an intact gold tooth.

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,593
Got a good chance of DNA.

00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,593
STOKES: This is probably
from a hip replacement.

00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,927
You know, if that crematorium
was doing their job right,

00:09:47,993 --> 00:09:49,127
this shouldn't exist.

00:09:49,193 --> 00:09:51,327
<i>2,100 degrees for three hours</i>

00:09:51,393 --> 00:09:54,193
<i>is what it takes to ensure
the disintegration of a corpse.</i>

00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,627
<i>Anything less than that,
plastic hip replacements,</i>

00:09:56,693 --> 00:09:59,193
<i>silicone implants,
large chunks of bone,</i>

00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,927
<i>are all going
to be left behind.</i>

00:10:00,993 --> 00:10:02,933
How does identifying
the cremains help us

00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,600
to identify the vic?

00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:07,600
I'm thinking the victim
and the dearly cremated

00:10:07,667 --> 00:10:10,333
were probably related.

00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,967
DNA should confirm.

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,733
(mellow jazz plays,
people conversing quietly)

00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:33,167
Excuse me?
You, uh, are you Ray?

00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:34,500
Yes. And you are?

00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:36,933
I'm the guy
who's marrying your wife.

00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,200
Phil Baker.

00:10:38,267 --> 00:10:39,900
Phil, nice to meet you.

00:10:39,967 --> 00:10:41,133
Nice to meet you, too.

00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,300
Beer? Wine?

00:10:42,367 --> 00:10:45,067
Um... shot of bourbon.

00:10:45,133 --> 00:10:47,200
Excuse me.
Can I get a shot of tequila

00:10:47,267 --> 00:10:49,700
and a shot of bourbon,
please? Thanks.

00:10:49,767 --> 00:10:52,333
So, look, hey,
thanks for coming.

00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,200
You know, Gloria raves
about you, and, uh...

00:10:55,267 --> 00:10:56,400
BARTENDER:
Gentlemen.

00:10:56,467 --> 00:10:58,667
Thanks. Thanks. Great.

00:10:58,733 --> 00:11:00,367
Here's to you and Gloria.

00:11:00,433 --> 00:11:02,373
Thank you.

00:11:06,473 --> 00:11:09,307
Hey, looks like you did
the deed before us, huh?

00:11:09,373 --> 00:11:10,840
You should have
brought her.

00:11:10,907 --> 00:11:12,173
(both laughing)

00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,373
Well, um...

00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,973
I see that Gloria is
still fashionably late.

00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,040
Good to see she didn't
save that one just for me.

00:11:19,107 --> 00:11:21,040
Some things never change.
Yeah.

00:11:21,107 --> 00:11:22,407
Anyway, look, uh...

00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:25,140
You know, Gloria really wants
you to come to the wedding.

00:11:25,207 --> 00:11:27,473
And I just want you to know
I'm-I'm-I'm cool with that.

00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,173
You know? I'm...
Thank you.

00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,173
LANGSTON:
Hey.

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,207
Wow.

00:11:33,273 --> 00:11:34,507
Okay.

00:11:34,573 --> 00:11:36,473
You actually came!

00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,873
(laughs)
Wow.

00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:40,807
Oh, thank you.

00:11:40,873 --> 00:11:42,007
Hi.
Hey.

00:11:42,073 --> 00:11:44,907
How you doing?
Good.

00:11:44,973 --> 00:11:46,807
Yeah... hey,
we were just,

00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:48,307
we were just talking about
the wedding, and, uh...

00:11:48,373 --> 00:11:49,673
What?

00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,607
No. Babe.

00:11:51,673 --> 00:11:52,740
GLORIA:
Babe, I told you to not to.

00:11:52,807 --> 00:11:54,173
PHIL:
He said he's gonna come.

00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,340
GLORIA:
No, he's not gonna come.

00:11:55,407 --> 00:11:56,673
Okay? He barely made
it for our wedding.

00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,940
So...

00:11:59,007 --> 00:12:01,280
Ray, oh my God.
I'm s...

00:12:01,347 --> 00:12:02,980
(chuckles)
I'm sorry.

00:12:03,047 --> 00:12:04,180
I didn't mean it
that way. I just...

00:12:04,247 --> 00:12:05,713
Yes, you did.
But it's okay.

00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:06,780
Because you couldn't
be more right.

00:12:06,847 --> 00:12:09,080
I barely made our wedding.

00:12:09,147 --> 00:12:10,180
(chuckles)

00:12:10,247 --> 00:12:14,013
So want to assure you
that I will be early

00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,647
for your wedding to Phil.

00:12:16,713 --> 00:12:20,347
Y... Y-You're gonna come?

00:12:20,413 --> 00:12:22,180
I'm invited?

00:12:22,247 --> 00:12:23,280
Yes!
Yes?

00:12:23,347 --> 00:12:24,347
(laughs)
I'll be there.

00:12:24,413 --> 00:12:25,480
Thanks a lot, man.

00:12:25,547 --> 00:12:26,547
Thank you.

00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:27,713
GLORIA: Oh, babe.
PHIL: Yeah.

00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,847
GLORIA:
He's gonna come.

00:12:28,913 --> 00:12:29,880
PHIL: I know he's
gonna come-- I told you.

00:12:29,947 --> 00:12:30,913
(smooching)

00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,280
SANDERS:
Hodges got a CODIS hit

00:12:32,347 --> 00:12:34,080
off that gold tooth
he found in the cremains.

00:12:34,147 --> 00:12:36,347
Joe Malton.
Death row inmate.

00:12:36,413 --> 00:12:37,947
Killed his girlfriend
20 years ago,

00:12:38,013 --> 00:12:39,880
but he had a heart attack before
they could give him the needle.

00:12:39,947 --> 00:12:41,780
Hmm. When did he die?

00:12:41,847 --> 00:12:43,213
Two years ago.

00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,247
Crazy thing is,
the cremains were a mixture.

00:12:45,313 --> 00:12:46,713
Two sets of DNA.

00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:49,113
Death Row Joe
and an unknown female.

00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,980
So the killer
poured the cremains

00:12:51,047 --> 00:12:52,547
from two different
urns into the victim,

00:12:52,613 --> 00:12:54,680
or it was two sources
mixed into one?

00:12:54,747 --> 00:12:57,080
But who wants to get mixed
in with a psycho killer?

00:12:57,147 --> 00:12:59,447
Well, it sounds like
this crematorium

00:12:59,513 --> 00:13:01,687
where Joe was incinerated is
running a shady business.

00:13:01,753 --> 00:13:03,120
Cutting corners.

00:13:03,187 --> 00:13:05,087
I'll bet they're burning more
than one body at a time.

00:13:19,187 --> 00:13:21,587
Hey, boys.

00:13:23,787 --> 00:13:26,120
You guys in charge?

00:13:30,387 --> 00:13:31,787
(Stokes coughing)

00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:33,820
Gross.

00:13:39,853 --> 00:13:42,153
Now why'd you have
to go and do that?

00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,120
See, now you made me mad.

00:13:44,187 --> 00:13:45,853
I just wanted
to talk to you.

00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,520
You're making this harder
than it needs to be, guys.

00:14:12,293 --> 00:14:14,160
We'd like to take a
look at your records.

00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:34,566
The unknown female cremains
aren't unknown anymore.

00:14:34,633 --> 00:14:36,500
They belong
to Sabrina Pose.

00:14:36,566 --> 00:14:38,700
Died two years ago
in a car accident.

00:14:38,766 --> 00:14:40,700
According to the
crematorium's records,

00:14:40,767 --> 00:14:43,200
she was cremated
the same day as Death Row Joe.

00:14:43,267 --> 00:14:46,033
Shared this house
with her husband Ronald Pose.

00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,800
His DMV photo
matches our John Doe.

00:14:47,867 --> 00:14:49,033
He live alone?

00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,533
With his daughter
Camryn, 13. No sign of her.

00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,067
Well, let's hope
she's at school

00:14:53,133 --> 00:14:54,233
or at her friend's house,

00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,000
and not in some box
like her old man.

00:14:56,067 --> 00:14:57,167
I've got a call into CPS.

00:14:57,233 --> 00:14:58,900
This house wasn't

00:14:58,967 --> 00:15:00,800
on the Thrift Store
pick-up list,

00:15:00,867 --> 00:15:03,140
but the one across
the street was.

00:15:03,207 --> 00:15:04,273
I'll go check it out.

00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,007
Thanks.
Yeah, yeah, thanks.

00:15:19,407 --> 00:15:23,307
Husband and wife
were both lawyers.

00:15:23,373 --> 00:15:24,673
Accounts for the swanky pad.

00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,840
STOKES: There's a void
on the mantle.

00:15:26,907 --> 00:15:29,007
Typical place to put the
urn, over the fireplace.

00:15:29,073 --> 00:15:31,640
Maybe the killer
took it with him.

00:15:52,273 --> 00:15:55,507
Found his night cap kit.

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,447
This looks like ash
on the lampshade here.

00:16:10,547 --> 00:16:12,180
Ligature marks
on the bedposts.

00:16:17,413 --> 00:16:19,747
This is home plate.

00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:20,947
Let's check the bed.

00:16:38,947 --> 00:16:40,580
More cremains.

00:16:40,647 --> 00:16:43,880
The directionality
of the ash

00:16:43,947 --> 00:16:45,413
suggests that
he was dragged

00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,213
by his feet off the
end of the bed.

00:16:56,747 --> 00:16:58,680
I got an ash trail.

00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,353
Trail ends here.

00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:07,520
STOKES: It's easier to sweep
the ash up off the tile

00:17:07,587 --> 00:17:08,687
than to get it
out of carpet.

00:17:08,753 --> 00:17:10,520
And if you're gonna
chop somebody up,

00:17:10,587 --> 00:17:11,753
this is the best
place to do it,

00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:14,153
then the easiest
to clean up.

00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:19,253
These are recent
cut marks, Sara.

00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,453
Slaughter tub.

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,787
Whew.

00:17:22,853 --> 00:17:24,653
There's no blood trail
in the house.

00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,120
I'm thinking
that the killer

00:17:26,187 --> 00:17:27,987
packed up
the parts in here.

00:17:28,053 --> 00:17:29,453
So where'd he box him up?

00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,587
Garage.
Garage.

00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,987
(trilling)

00:18:02,493 --> 00:18:05,027
(trilling)

00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,693
♪ ♪

00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,300
STOKES:
<i>The killer kills the vic
in his own bed,</i>

00:19:03,367 --> 00:19:06,633
<i>dismembers him in the tub,

00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,200

00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,933
And somebody else disposes
of the body for you.

00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,400
It's kind of genius.

00:19:16,467 --> 00:19:18,433
The house is empty.
Foreclosure.

00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,567
Belonged to
a minister and his wife.

00:19:20,633 --> 00:19:22,167
I'm running
them down now.
All right.

00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,100
(clears throat)

00:19:31,433 --> 00:19:33,033
Why are you at my house?

00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,400
I'm Nick.
This is Frankie.

00:19:35,467 --> 00:19:36,900
We're with
the police department.

00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,400
The police?

00:19:38,467 --> 00:19:40,733
Something's happened,
and we need

00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,700
to talk to
you about it.

00:19:42,767 --> 00:19:44,567
When was the last time
you saw your dad?

00:19:44,633 --> 00:19:46,533
Last night.

00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,233
Before I went to bed.

00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,967
Look, if you need
to talk to him,

00:19:50,033 --> 00:19:51,267
he's probably at work.

00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:52,433
Was there anyone else

00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,267
in the house with
you last night?

00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:56,200
No.

00:19:56,267 --> 00:19:57,967
How'd you get to
school this morning?

00:19:58,033 --> 00:20:00,033
I'm on it.

00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,000
My dad goes to
work really early,

00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:04,540
so I usually just get myself
ready for school.

00:20:05,773 --> 00:20:07,707
Can I go now?

00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:09,173
No. I'm sorry, Camryn.

00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,140
You're going to have to go

00:20:11,207 --> 00:20:13,840
with Child Services,
just for now.

00:20:17,707 --> 00:20:20,440
I just want
to go to my room.

00:20:20,507 --> 00:20:21,573
No, no, no, no,
no, Camryn.

00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,707
I can't let you
go in there.

00:20:22,773 --> 00:20:23,907
I can't.

00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:25,173
Why not?

00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,040
'Cause something
really bad's

00:20:27,107 --> 00:20:28,207
happened to your dad.

00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:32,707
(sobbing)

00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,707
I'm sorry, honey.

00:20:34,773 --> 00:20:37,573
I'm so sorry.

00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,440
Hey.

00:20:39,507 --> 00:20:42,707
Hey. Just got done processing
some prints that Sara sent over.

00:20:42,773 --> 00:20:44,373
Got a hit off a work card

00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,373
that's worth checking out.

00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,773
Local dancer.
Stripper?

00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,573
No. She works on the Strip

00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,740
for some of Vegas's
biggest shows.

00:20:49,807 --> 00:20:50,940
All right.
Besides the photo,

00:20:51,007 --> 00:20:52,107
what about her
is worth looking at?

00:20:52,173 --> 00:20:53,340
She's the vic's
ex-girlfriend.

00:20:53,407 --> 00:20:54,507
Ah.

00:20:54,573 --> 00:20:56,207
Her prints were all
over his bedroom.

00:20:56,273 --> 00:20:59,007
It's obviously a live-in,
'cause she has the same address.

00:20:59,073 --> 00:21:01,107
Hey, didn't Nick and Sara
find some dancer's clothes

00:21:01,173 --> 00:21:02,980
in a box at the thrift store?
Sure did.

00:21:03,047 --> 00:21:04,980
Nick found even more women's
clothes in the garage.

00:21:05,047 --> 00:21:06,947
Doesn't sound
like an amicable breakup.

00:21:07,013 --> 00:21:08,680
Well, maybe he kicked her out.

00:21:08,747 --> 00:21:10,047
Wouldn't let her
take her things.

00:21:10,113 --> 00:21:11,247
She probably has a key.

00:21:11,313 --> 00:21:12,647
Instead of coming
back for her stuff,

00:21:12,713 --> 00:21:14,213
she comes back for revenge.

00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,380
Well, revenge
is one thing, but, uh...

00:21:17,447 --> 00:21:19,380
shoving his dead wife's
ashes down his throat

00:21:19,447 --> 00:21:21,180
and slicing him up...

00:21:21,247 --> 00:21:23,180
that's a monster.

00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,813
♪ ♪

00:21:56,713 --> 00:21:58,780
♪ ♪

00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,187
(shouts over music):
Excuse me, ladies.

00:22:03,253 --> 00:22:07,053
We are looking for
a Sydney Preston.

00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,553
Sydney Preston?

00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,853
What's the problem?

00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,820
We'd like to talk about that
at the station.

00:22:12,887 --> 00:22:15,453
I can't. I'm rehearsing.
What's up?

00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,887
Do you know Ronald Pose?

00:22:16,953 --> 00:22:19,453
Yeah. Why?

00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,853
He's dead.

00:22:23,553 --> 00:22:26,287
Do you still want to
talk about that here?

00:22:32,165 --> 00:22:35,667
When was the last time you
were in Ron Pose's house?

00:22:37,134 --> 00:22:39,934
About two weeks ago...

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,500
when I found out
he cheated on me.

00:22:42,567 --> 00:22:44,200
And you haven't been back since?

00:22:44,267 --> 00:22:45,700
No.Mm-hmm.

00:22:45,767 --> 00:22:47,100
According to
your work card,

00:22:47,167 --> 00:22:48,500
you still live there.

00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:51,000
I moved in with my mom.
Work has been hectic.

00:22:51,067 --> 00:22:54,234
Haven't had a chance
to go look for a new place.

00:22:56,867 --> 00:22:58,967
Do you recognize
these things?

00:23:00,067 --> 00:23:02,240
Are they yours?

00:23:03,807 --> 00:23:06,907
So you moved out of Ron
Pose's house two weeks ago,

00:23:06,974 --> 00:23:08,674
but your belongings
are still there. Why?

00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,607
I never got a chance to go back

00:23:10,674 --> 00:23:12,607
because I didn't want
to see him.

00:23:12,674 --> 00:23:14,474
After the breakup, that...

00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,707
that's the last thing
that I wanted, so...

00:23:16,774 --> 00:23:18,774
I left my stuff there.

00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,874
What does this have to do
with anything?

00:23:22,374 --> 00:23:25,407
This box of dance attire
was found along

00:23:25,474 --> 00:23:27,274
with some
other boxes.

00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,807
In those other boxes,
we found Ron's body parts.

00:23:32,007 --> 00:23:33,940
Someone cut him up?

00:23:35,807 --> 00:23:38,174
Why would someone do that?

00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,874
You tell me.

00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:42,440
Wait-- you don't think
that I did it?

00:23:42,507 --> 00:23:43,674
Why not?

00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:46,607
In spite of everything,
I still loved Ron.

00:23:46,674 --> 00:23:48,507
Do you?
I love him more

00:23:48,574 --> 00:23:49,907
than I've loved any man.

00:23:49,974 --> 00:23:51,474
I thought he was the one.

00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:55,274
Apparently, I was
one of many.

00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,774
So Ron saw a lot of women?

00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,507
He was a juggler.
He had a stable.

00:23:58,574 --> 00:24:00,640
You would think that a widower

00:24:00,707 --> 00:24:02,247
would be rusty on their skills.

00:24:02,314 --> 00:24:03,514
No, uh-uh, not him.

00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,147
You have any names?

00:24:05,214 --> 00:24:07,747
Serina. Tammy.

00:24:07,814 --> 00:24:11,047
Julie. Deanna.

00:24:11,114 --> 00:24:13,314
The list goes on.Mm-hmm.

00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:16,247
All I know is that I didn't want
to be on that list, so I left.

00:24:18,047 --> 00:24:19,280
What's going on with Camryn?

00:24:19,347 --> 00:24:20,814
Where is she?
She's fine.

00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,147
She's with
Child Protective Services.

00:24:22,214 --> 00:24:24,847
No. She-She doesn't
belong there.

00:24:24,914 --> 00:24:27,280
She can stay with me.

00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,414
Can I leave?

00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:35,080
As soon as I get a DNA sample
from you, you are free to go.

00:24:35,147 --> 00:24:37,214
Whatever it takes
to get me out of here.

00:24:39,147 --> 00:24:41,680
So how long did you live
across from the Poses?

00:24:41,747 --> 00:24:44,014
Oh. 15 years.

00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:48,847
But even the Lord is not safe
from this hellish economy.

00:24:48,914 --> 00:24:50,380
(laughs)

00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:53,980
Church foreclosed,
the house went next.

00:24:54,047 --> 00:24:56,680
We were forced to move
into a smaller place.

00:24:56,747 --> 00:24:58,880
And so you donated
what you couldn't take

00:24:58,947 --> 00:25:00,214
to the thrift store.

00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,787
Unfortunately for us.

00:25:01,854 --> 00:25:03,387
Fortunately for someone else.

00:25:03,454 --> 00:25:04,654
Hmm.

00:25:07,587 --> 00:25:09,520
What is she
doing here?

00:25:09,587 --> 00:25:12,054
So, how well do you know
Ms. Preston?

00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,954
Well, better than
I knew Ron, actually.

00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,687
He wasn't really
around that much.

00:25:15,754 --> 00:25:18,420
But Sydney-- she used
to spent a lot of time

00:25:18,487 --> 00:25:20,020
with his daughter Camryn.

00:25:20,087 --> 00:25:22,320
I mean, even when
her mother was alive,

00:25:22,387 --> 00:25:26,087
she was basically alone,
or with babysitters.

00:25:26,154 --> 00:25:29,987
Lawyers-- you know,
they work day and night.

00:25:30,054 --> 00:25:31,920
Camryn-- she
raised herself.

00:25:31,987 --> 00:25:34,887
But when Ron started dating
Sydney, all that changed.

00:25:34,954 --> 00:25:37,354
<i>See, Camryn was an only child,
like Sydney,</i>

00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:42,487
<i>and I always felt like they had
a spiritual connection, too.</i>

00:25:42,554 --> 00:25:44,987
So, what about Sydney's
relationship with Ron?

00:25:45,054 --> 00:25:47,820
Well, it's the first time
since his wife died,

00:25:47,887 --> 00:25:49,487
I even saw a
smile on his face.

00:25:49,554 --> 00:25:51,754
<i>That is, of course,
until they broke up.</i>

00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,220
<i>Man, he was screaming.</i>

00:25:53,287 --> 00:25:55,020
<i>She didn't want to have
anything to do with him.</i>

00:25:55,087 --> 00:25:56,987
<i>It broke Camryn's heart.</i>

00:25:57,054 --> 00:25:59,420
<i>Must've felt like
losing another mother.</i>

00:25:59,487 --> 00:26:01,694
<i>Sydney came to church
the next day.</i>

00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,194
Did she tell you
what the fight was all about?

00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:07,894
Something about strange videos.

00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:11,094
Videos? She say
what was on them?

00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,627
Girls.

00:26:12,694 --> 00:26:14,494
Sex tapes. I don't know.

00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,660
I didn't pry.

00:26:15,727 --> 00:26:17,060
That's not my world.

00:26:17,127 --> 00:26:19,494
So, as far as you know,
did Sydney ever come back

00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,360
to the house
after the big fight?No.

00:26:21,427 --> 00:26:24,827
That's the last time I
saw her until just now.

00:26:29,227 --> 00:26:30,494
We've got a
lot of evidence.

00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:33,360
Yeah, but it adds up
to a whole lot of nothing.

00:26:33,427 --> 00:26:34,660
Yeah, probably
'cause we're dealing

00:26:34,727 --> 00:26:37,027
with the cleanest
house in Las Vegas.

00:26:37,094 --> 00:26:38,760
All the prints
are explainable.

00:26:38,827 --> 00:26:41,160
Belonging to either
the vic, his daughter,

00:26:41,227 --> 00:26:43,460
the housekeeper
or Sydney Preston.

00:26:43,527 --> 00:26:45,727
Prints from the moving boxes
are also explainable.

00:26:45,794 --> 00:26:47,994
They come back
to the thrift shop driver,

00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,894
the victim,
his daughter or Sydney.

00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,660
And we found no prints
on the wire saw.

00:26:52,727 --> 00:26:54,660
Okay.

00:26:54,727 --> 00:26:56,694
What about the
blood evidence?

00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,560
Blood all came back
to the victim.

00:26:58,627 --> 00:27:00,027
Killer must've
worn gloves.

00:27:00,094 --> 00:27:02,000
STOKES:
So the killer cleaned up.

00:27:02,067 --> 00:27:03,467
Knew the neighbors were moving.

00:27:03,534 --> 00:27:06,000
The garbage bags and boxes
were in the victim's garage.

00:27:06,067 --> 00:27:07,634
Killer knew
the house.

00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,134
My money's on Sydney.

00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,500
She had motive.

00:27:10,567 --> 00:27:11,900
Their breakup was ugly.

00:27:11,967 --> 00:27:14,600
And the minister said
there were sex tapes involved.

00:27:14,667 --> 00:27:16,334
You know, we haven't released
the house yet.

00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,534
<i>I could go back,
look for 'em.</i>

00:27:50,434 --> 00:27:52,267

00:28:14,607 --> 00:28:17,540
So you just, like,
want me to talk about myself?

00:28:17,607 --> 00:28:19,174
MAN:
Yeah. How old you are,

00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,040
where you're from,
that kind of thing.

00:28:21,107 --> 00:28:23,240
I'm 22, I grew up in Cali,

00:28:23,307 --> 00:28:25,607
and got into singing
and dancing real young.

00:28:25,674 --> 00:28:26,907
Any kids?

00:28:26,974 --> 00:28:28,274
One, and she's just--

00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,707
Wow, that's great.
Okay, let's see you dance.

He was a lawyer,

Have you watched
them all?

All but one.

00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,347
There's 30 tapes.

Well, they come from
Trufant Productions.

00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,480
Maybe they can tell us
why they were locked up

00:29:22,547 --> 00:29:23,647
in a dead man's safe.

00:29:23,714 --> 00:29:25,547
Yeah. I under... I understand.

00:29:25,614 --> 00:29:27,280
No, that girl is a wax figure.

00:29:27,347 --> 00:29:29,214
The last thing
she needs is more procedures.

00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,180

Hey, that's a big call.

00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:36,347
And you're gonna be
in big trouble

00:29:36,414 --> 00:29:38,880
if you don't sit
down, Mr. Trufant.

00:29:38,947 --> 00:29:41,347
What exactly do you do?

00:29:41,414 --> 00:29:43,547
Agent, manager, producer.

00:29:43,614 --> 00:29:44,647
Busy man.

00:29:44,714 --> 00:29:46,080
What kind of shows
do you produce?

00:29:46,147 --> 00:29:47,247
Reality shows
to strip shows

00:29:47,314 --> 00:29:49,480
and everything in between.
What am I doing here?

These your tapes?

00:29:51,747 --> 00:29:53,380
Not anymore.

00:29:53,447 --> 00:29:56,247
I mean, I made them, yeah,
but I-I gave them away.

00:29:56,314 --> 00:29:58,514
Who'd you give them to?

00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:00,987

book you, you know.

She's a casting director
for the LVPD.

00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:08,087
I gave 'em to my buddy, Ron.

00:30:08,154 --> 00:30:09,420
I was just trying
to help him out.

00:30:09,487 --> 00:30:11,154
Help him out, how?

00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,320
He's not a club guy.

00:30:12,387 --> 00:30:14,187
I've known him
since he was a kid,

00:30:14,254 --> 00:30:15,354
and-and he's a little nerdy.

00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,520
He's not a go-getter.

00:30:16,587 --> 00:30:17,920
Always needed a little help
with the ladies.

00:30:17,987 --> 00:30:20,320
Especially since his wifey died.

00:30:20,387 --> 00:30:22,254
REED:
So, you held
these auditions

00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,320
to get him laid?
Basically.

00:30:24,387 --> 00:30:26,187
I mean, we didn't tell
the girls that, of course.

00:30:26,254 --> 00:30:27,654
Said we were producing
a new hip-hop musical.

00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,654
REED:
So Ron watches the tapes,

00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,754
and he picks the girls
that he likes?

00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:33,020
Yeah, and then

00:30:33,087 --> 00:30:34,254
I set up the dates.

00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,820
Tell the girls
Ron's the executive producer

00:30:35,887 --> 00:30:37,254
on the project,
make him sound important.

00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,754
What happens when they find out
the show is a fake?

00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,754
I just tell the girls
the project fell through.

00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,287
Lost the venue,
couldn't get the rights

00:30:43,354 --> 00:30:45,354
to the story-- whatever,
blah, blah-- that's easy.

00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,187
By that time,
the girl is hooked on Ronny.

00:30:47,254 --> 00:30:48,420
I mean, once you get past

00:30:48,487 --> 00:30:50,187
his nerdy side,
he's a charming guy

00:30:50,254 --> 00:30:51,554
with money to blow.

00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:53,487
You want to know how many girls
he picked off those tapes?

00:30:53,554 --> 00:30:54,687
We can only imagine.

00:30:54,754 --> 00:30:56,087
Seriously, so,

00:30:56,154 --> 00:30:58,487
what kind of charge am I looking
at for something like this?

00:30:58,554 --> 00:31:00,820
I mean, honestly, I thought
it was all legal, you know.

00:31:00,887 --> 00:31:01,994
REED: I'm a
homicide detective.

00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,560
You are here
because Ron was murdered.

00:31:05,627 --> 00:31:07,594
Well, Ron's, Ron's my boy.

00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,527
I'd never do anything
to hurt him.

00:31:09,594 --> 00:31:11,827
You got copies of those tapes?

00:31:11,894 --> 00:31:13,560
Of course.

00:31:13,627 --> 00:31:15,460
Yeah, I keep all the originals.

00:31:15,527 --> 00:31:17,894
I'd like to take a look
at number 15.

00:31:19,994 --> 00:31:21,927
(whirrs, beeps)

00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,660
TRUFANT:
Beautiful Sydney,
what's up?

00:31:25,727 --> 00:31:28,294
You know. Another day,
another casting.

00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,760
What's up with you?

00:31:29,827 --> 00:31:31,227
TRUFANT: Ah, you know,
same old thing.

00:31:31,294 --> 00:31:32,527
Just putting together
another show.

00:31:32,594 --> 00:31:36,094
So, Sydney finds Ron's
secret stash of tapes.

00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:39,660
She realizes she was
auditioning to be
his girlfriend.

00:31:39,727 --> 00:31:41,860
She feels betrayed,
kills him,

00:31:41,927 --> 00:31:43,527
slices him up
and takes the tape.

00:31:43,594 --> 00:31:46,027
I think the cremains
were Sydney's way of telling Ron

00:31:46,094 --> 00:31:47,794
that he belonged
with his wife.

00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:50,827
In death.

00:31:55,227 --> 00:31:56,594
TRUFANT:
What's with the guitar?

00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,560
I'm taking lessons.

00:31:58,627 --> 00:31:59,794
Let me see it.

00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,060
Okay.

00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:03,800
I thought that I would play you
a little something.

00:32:03,867 --> 00:32:05,167
Yeah.

00:32:05,234 --> 00:32:07,300
That guitar was in
one of the boxes

00:32:07,367 --> 00:32:08,467
from the thrift store.

00:32:08,534 --> 00:32:09,634
We have that in evidence.

00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,834
Those guitar strings are strong

00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,167
and thin enough to

00:32:12,234 --> 00:32:15,500
make those ligature marks
on the body and bedposts.

00:32:15,567 --> 00:32:16,734
Hey, guys.

00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,267
I got the infrared
photos from Autopsy.

00:32:19,334 --> 00:32:22,334
There's some odd-looking
bruises on the victim's chest.

00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,667
Check it out.

00:32:23,734 --> 00:32:25,700
Looks like the killer
was pressing down

00:32:25,767 --> 00:32:27,500
pretty hard on him
with something.

00:32:27,567 --> 00:32:29,234
Well, the shape
of those bruises

00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:32,800
look an awful lot
like Sydney's knee pads.

00:32:34,767 --> 00:32:36,100
(coughing)

00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,967
SIDLE:
Guitar's missing

00:32:45,034 --> 00:32:46,467
four strings.

00:32:46,534 --> 00:32:49,800
Just the amount needed
to tie up our vic.

00:32:49,867 --> 00:32:52,100
This guitar is clean.

00:32:52,167 --> 00:32:54,100
I'm not getting a single print.

00:32:54,167 --> 00:32:55,967
Maybe DNA--
we'll have more luck.

00:32:58,334 --> 00:33:00,300
SANDERS:
Wear pattern's a match.

00:33:00,367 --> 00:33:03,640
Sydney was wearing these
knee pads when she killed him.

00:33:06,774 --> 00:33:09,140
See, Cam? We're closer to
getting you out of here.

00:33:09,207 --> 00:33:10,607
Today?

00:33:10,674 --> 00:33:12,474
Few days at the most.

00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,940
And I'll come live
with you, right?

00:33:14,007 --> 00:33:15,774
Where else would you go?

00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,774
(chuckles)

00:33:21,907 --> 00:33:23,940
What are they doing here?

00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,474
REED:
Hey, Camryn.

00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:28,640
Ms. Preston, we need you
to come with us.

00:33:28,707 --> 00:33:29,840
Why?

00:33:29,907 --> 00:33:30,874
We can talk
about it downtown.

00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,174
Please don't go.

00:33:34,074 --> 00:33:35,440
Don't worry, I'll be back
here for you, okay, Cam?

00:33:35,507 --> 00:33:36,440
No, I'll come with you.

00:33:36,507 --> 00:33:38,374
Just let me go.

00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,974
I don't want to be here alone.

00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,274
Well, I'll stay here with you.

00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,840
If you want.

00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,807
We'll order a pizza
up in here. I don't care.

00:33:53,874 --> 00:33:55,340
We can watch a movie or
something. You hungry?

00:33:55,407 --> 00:33:57,307
Everything's going
to be okay, Cam.

00:33:57,374 --> 00:33:59,307
Hey, it's going
to be all right.

00:34:02,214 --> 00:34:04,547
This is bordering
on harassment.

00:34:04,614 --> 00:34:06,014
I didn't do
anything wrong.

00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,080
You haven't been
honest with us.

00:34:08,147 --> 00:34:09,514
I told you
everything I know.

00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:13,014
About Serina and Julie
and Tara and Deanna,

00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,547
but not about
these other women.

00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,980
I believe this
is the reason

00:34:21,047 --> 00:34:22,914
you broke up with Ron.

00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:25,647
You found these audition
tapes, and you snapped.

00:34:25,714 --> 00:34:27,647
Maybe I did.

00:34:30,247 --> 00:34:32,847
Here's this-this
geeky business guy,

00:34:32,914 --> 00:34:34,947
who wasn't my type at all.

00:34:35,014 --> 00:34:37,047
Wasn't out
in the club every night,

00:34:37,114 --> 00:34:39,347
or-or spitting
mad game at me.

00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,880
I fell in love
with him anyway.

00:34:42,947 --> 00:34:45,314
Till I found out

00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:47,314
he was the shadiest
of them all.

00:34:49,614 --> 00:34:51,747
I felt angry, betrayed.

00:34:51,814 --> 00:34:53,480
I didn't want anyone to know

00:34:53,547 --> 00:34:55,214
I fell for something
so stupid,

00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,780
including you guys.

00:34:56,847 --> 00:34:58,780
All right.

00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,854
Are these
your knee pads?

00:35:07,887 --> 00:35:10,187
Yeah.

00:35:10,254 --> 00:35:13,054
Is this your guitar?

00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,854
Yes.

00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,220
All right.

00:35:16,287 --> 00:35:19,187
The guitar is missing
four strings.

00:35:19,254 --> 00:35:22,354
We believe those strings
were used to tie Ron down.

00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,120
The knee pads were used
to hold him down

00:35:24,187 --> 00:35:26,054
while he was choking
on his wife's remains.

00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,720
I left these things back
there at the house.

00:35:28,787 --> 00:35:30,720
And then you went
back for them.

00:35:30,787 --> 00:35:33,520
Decided to pack up
a few boxes of Ron.

00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,720
You know, you sound
real crazy right now.

00:35:36,787 --> 00:35:38,054
No, crazy is what we found

00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,220
when we processed
the knee pads for DNA.

00:35:40,287 --> 00:35:44,054
Inside the knee pads, we found
DNA from two contributors.

00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:47,820
A major one
and a minor one.

00:35:47,887 --> 00:35:49,287
You were
the minor contributor.

00:35:49,354 --> 00:35:50,954
But that's weird.

00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:53,787
They're your knee pads.

00:35:53,854 --> 00:35:57,320
The major contributor
had half of Ron's DNA.

00:35:57,387 --> 00:36:00,994
<i>Half...--of Ron's DNA.</i>

00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:03,060
Now, who would have
half of Ron's DNA?

00:36:03,127 --> 00:36:05,694
His daughter Camryn.

00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,727
I used to let her use
my stuff all the time.

00:36:08,794 --> 00:36:10,427
If someone besides you and
Camryn used the knee pads,

00:36:10,494 --> 00:36:11,894
we would have found DNA.
We didn't.

00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,460
That means either
you killed Ron,

00:36:14,527 --> 00:36:17,527
or the two of you
killed him together.

00:36:17,594 --> 00:36:20,094
I didn't kill anyone,

00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:24,027
let alone use a
child to help me.

00:36:24,094 --> 00:36:26,627
I love that little girl.

00:36:26,694 --> 00:36:30,260
That means there's only
one other possibility, Sydney.

00:36:31,727 --> 00:36:33,627
No, there's not.

00:36:33,694 --> 00:36:35,594
There's got to be
an explanation.

00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,594
Let me talk to her.

00:36:56,227 --> 00:36:58,827
I knew you'd get me
out of that place.

00:36:58,894 --> 00:37:01,134
I didn't get you out.

00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,367
The police did.

00:37:03,434 --> 00:37:05,967
Look...

00:37:06,034 --> 00:37:08,034
they think we did something
bad to your dad.

00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,634
But we didn't.

00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:10,800
I know that.

00:37:10,867 --> 00:37:12,200
You know that.

00:37:12,267 --> 00:37:13,534
But they don't.

00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,000
If you know what happened

00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:19,867
to your Dad, you
have to tell me.

00:37:19,934 --> 00:37:22,200
Or else we'll never get
to see each other again.

00:37:24,967 --> 00:37:27,134
Did anyone come see your dad
at the house that night?

00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,667
Maybe another girl?

00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,834
I won't get mad,
I promise.

00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:36,034
You can tell me.

00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:38,134
Did you hear anything?

00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,334
Did you see anything?

00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,367
Please tell me.

00:37:41,434 --> 00:37:43,034
Who else was there?

00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,867
What happened, Cam?

00:37:44,934 --> 00:37:47,967
Just tell me.

00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,600
He got mad, Syd.

00:37:55,934 --> 00:37:58,467
Just because I was
playing your guitar.

00:37:58,534 --> 00:38:01,840
♪ ♪

00:38:01,907 --> 00:38:03,840
Honey, turn it down.
I'm trying to do some work.

00:38:03,907 --> 00:38:06,174
(music stops)

00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,374
I told you to stop playing
with Sydney's stuff, didn't I?

00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,174
Get rid of it!

00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,474
There's no Sydney anymore!
Sydney's dead!

00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:14,507
You get it?

00:38:16,774 --> 00:38:19,607
My birthday parties were always
thrown by my grandparents.

00:38:19,674 --> 00:38:21,874
And when they died,

00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:24,907
they were thrown
by my babysitters.

00:38:24,974 --> 00:38:27,140
Until you showed up.

00:38:29,074 --> 00:38:33,007
I didn't have parents
until you showed up.

00:38:34,374 --> 00:38:35,807
What are you trying to say?

00:38:38,074 --> 00:38:40,007
(crying)

00:38:45,507 --> 00:38:48,640
When he said you were dead,

00:38:48,707 --> 00:38:50,640
I wanted him dead.

00:38:55,107 --> 00:38:57,574
CAMRYN (over speaker): So after
he took his sleeping pills,

00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,007
I snuck into his room

00:38:59,074 --> 00:39:00,947
<i>and tied him down.</i>

00:39:02,247 --> 00:39:03,980
<i>Fed him my mom's ashes.</i>

00:39:04,047 --> 00:39:05,514
<i>(Ron gagging)</i>

00:39:08,747 --> 00:39:11,780
<i>Dragged him into the bathroom.</i>

00:39:18,914 --> 00:39:20,347
<i>Put him in the boxes.</i>

00:39:20,414 --> 00:39:24,247
<i>Got rid of your stuff,
like he wanted me to do.</i>

00:39:26,914 --> 00:39:29,880
<i>And I left it all
on the minister's curb.</i>

00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:34,747
I hated my mom and my dad.

00:39:34,814 --> 00:39:37,047
They didn't have me
to love me.

00:39:39,247 --> 00:39:41,247
I just looked good
on their Christmas card.

00:39:41,314 --> 00:39:44,514
(over speakers):
He belonged with her.

00:39:47,914 --> 00:39:49,847
I belong with you.

00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,414
I don't believe you.

00:40:10,054 --> 00:40:11,820
Now do you believe me?

00:40:14,687 --> 00:40:16,054
What are you doing?

00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,087
Where are you going?

00:40:18,154 --> 00:40:19,954
Are you mad?

00:40:27,054 --> 00:40:29,787
(crying)

00:40:55,854 --> 00:40:58,887
It's always very difficult to
accept the truth about people.

00:40:58,954 --> 00:41:00,994
Especially about
people that we love.

00:41:04,694 --> 00:41:07,927
Denying it doesn't
make it go away.

00:41:09,894 --> 00:41:11,127
What's going to happen to her?

00:41:11,194 --> 00:41:13,627
LANGSTON:
<i>She'll be detained, tried,</i>

00:41:13,694 --> 00:41:15,994
<i>and, if convicted,</i>

00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:18,394
<i>she'll be in juvenile detention
until she's an adult.</i>

00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:21,927
<i>After that, it's pretty much
up to the courts.</i>

00:41:38,994 --> 00:41:41,160
I love you, Syd.

00:42:17,934 --> 00:42:19,367
Where you going,
looking so sharp?

00:42:19,434 --> 00:42:21,400
My wife's getting married.

00:42:21,467 --> 00:42:22,967
Hmm?

00:42:23,034 --> 00:42:26,934
My ex-wife is getting married.

00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:30,634
But you still
wear the ring.

00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,567
Yeah.

00:42:32,634 --> 00:42:33,900
I don't even know
why I do that.

00:42:33,967 --> 00:42:36,800
I mean, we got
divorced two years ago.

00:42:36,867 --> 00:42:39,667
I suppose it just represents
the best part of my life.

00:42:39,734 --> 00:42:41,134
I thought you were
living the best part

00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,334
of your life right now,
here with us.

00:42:43,734 --> 00:42:45,934
Yeah, you're right.
I am.
(laughs)

00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,434
(sighs heavily)

00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,334
I loved her a lot, Nick.

00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:54,134
I miss her. And...

00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:57,034
when she came
to visit the other day,

00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:59,234
I saw this look in her eyes
I'd seen many times before,

00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:01,240
whenever she was really happy.

00:43:01,307 --> 00:43:02,974
So...

00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:08,307
So... you're happy she's happy.

00:43:08,374 --> 00:43:10,840
Yeah, I guess that's one
way of looking at it.

00:43:10,907 --> 00:43:12,640
Well, it's big
of you to go.

00:43:12,707 --> 00:43:15,374
You're a good guy.

00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:19,307
But you might want
to do yourself a favor--

00:43:19,374 --> 00:43:22,748
take that ring off
before you go.
