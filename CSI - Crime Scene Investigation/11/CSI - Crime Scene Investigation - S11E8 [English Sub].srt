Ran into a few bodies.

00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:41,065
Most of them were
wearing cement shoes.

00:01:41,132 --> 00:01:43,265
And all of them
were named Anthony.

00:01:43,332 --> 00:01:45,232
Back in the good old days,
when the Mob really knew

Ah, yeah.

Sulfur spring. You know,
if you bathe in this water

Probable internal head trauma

00:02:13,538 --> 00:02:15,472

00:02:15,538 --> 00:02:17,538
Interesting pattern
to this wound.

00:02:17,605 --> 00:02:19,272
Maybe he hit his
head on the rocks?

00:02:19,338 --> 00:02:21,605
Well, it's an L-shaped wound,
so, not a rock.

00:02:21,672 --> 00:02:23,138
Probably a pistol butt.

No pruning on the volar pads.

00:02:35,605 --> 00:02:37,872
That means he was dead
before he hit the water

00:02:37,938 --> 00:02:39,238
or very soon after.

00:02:39,305 --> 00:02:41,005
Well, maybe there was a struggle
at the edge of the water.

00:02:41,072 --> 00:02:42,005

it's been in the engine

Yeah, and
I'm pretty sure

00:04:57,557 --> 00:04:59,557
I mean, it's okay.

00:04:59,623 --> 00:05:01,623
Just add a few carats.

00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:03,663
You'll thank me
for it later.

00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:05,063
(chuckles)

00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,997
Any thoughts on C.O.D.?

00:05:07,063 --> 00:05:09,530
We can rule out the
L-shaped laceration

00:05:09,597 --> 00:05:11,997
and associated blunt
force trauma to the head,

00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:15,363
because there was no
damage to the skull.

00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:18,330
I can't say the same
for the rest of him.

00:05:18,397 --> 00:05:20,897
He was a smorgasbord
of disease.

00:05:20,963 --> 00:05:22,897
Liver's enlarged
and necrotic.

00:05:22,963 --> 00:05:25,063
The brain and the
kidneys are peppered

00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,930
with precancerous lesions.

00:05:26,997 --> 00:05:29,263
The gastrointestinal
tract looks like

00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,530
it's been scrubbed
with steel wool.

00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:34,730
Plus there was nerve
tissue degeneration.

00:05:34,797 --> 00:05:35,930
How old was he?

00:05:35,997 --> 00:05:37,963
Not old enough
for all of this.

00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,430
He was a very sick man

00:05:39,497 --> 00:05:42,263
with a seriously-shortened
life expectancy.

00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,597
So, what <i>did--kill him?</i>

00:05:44,663 --> 00:05:47,863
I was just getting to that.

00:05:54,697 --> 00:05:56,630
He drowned.

00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:00,063
When the water passed
through his larynx,

00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:02,703
it caused a reflexive spasm,

00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:05,237
and that sealed the airway,

00:06:05,303 --> 00:06:08,503
making it impossible
for him to breathe.

00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:11,570
Not so good for him,
but good for us,

00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:13,737
because it locked
a sample of the water

00:06:13,803 --> 00:06:16,037
that killed him
into his vocal folds.

00:06:16,103 --> 00:06:18,637
Well, if he did drown
in that hot spring,

00:06:18,703 --> 00:06:20,737
the water sample
that Ray collected

00:06:20,803 --> 00:06:22,670
should match

00:06:22,737 --> 00:06:24,670
what you've got
in that syringe.

00:06:27,603 --> 00:06:29,837
Looks like two
different sources to me.

00:06:29,903 --> 00:06:32,203
Trace will have to confirm,
but I would say

00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:35,003
that our friend here
did not drown in that spring.

00:06:57,903 --> 00:06:59,203

00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:01,210

(trilling and beeping)

00:07:16,343 --> 00:07:20,010
WILLOWS: Floater's prints came
back to a Walter Burns.

00:07:20,077 --> 00:07:22,110
In the system for
assault, 25 years ago.

00:07:22,177 --> 00:07:24,477
He got into a bar
fight over a girl,

00:07:24,543 --> 00:07:25,777
but no record since then.

00:07:25,843 --> 00:07:27,077
Not exactly a hardened criminal.

00:07:27,143 --> 00:07:28,377
No.

00:07:28,443 --> 00:07:30,610
You check DMV?
Burns lived

00:07:30,677 --> 00:07:32,210
on a ranch in Cable Springs.

00:07:32,277 --> 00:07:34,277
Not far from
where we found him.
He owed a pickup,

00:07:34,343 --> 00:07:36,443
so, Brass put a broadcast out
on the plates.

00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,610
Sent a couple of unis over
to the ranch.

00:07:38,677 --> 00:07:40,310
No truck.
Not much of anything, really.

00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:42,210
The place had pretty much
gone to seed.

00:07:42,277 --> 00:07:43,843
Next of kin?

00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:46,010
Had a wife,
but she died last year.

00:07:46,077 --> 00:07:48,377
SANDERS: I checked
Walter Burns' phone records.

00:07:48,443 --> 00:07:51,910
Apparently, he didn't have
many friends, except maybe one.

00:07:51,977 --> 00:07:55,310
More than a dozen calls made
back and forth in the last week.

00:07:55,377 --> 00:07:56,577
Rosalind Johnson?

00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,743
She is the editor
of the <i>Cable Springs Courier.</i>

00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:00,677
JOHNSON:
<i>Editor,</i>

00:08:00,743 --> 00:08:03,083
publisher, lead reporter,
advertising rep.

00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,383
And I sweep the place out
every night.

00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:06,850
BRASS:
So, what capacity

00:08:06,917 --> 00:08:08,983
were you calling Walter Burns
three times a day?

00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:11,350
Walter is a source for a story
I'm working on.
What story?

00:08:11,417 --> 00:08:14,983
Not at liberty to say,
but you'll be reading about it

00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,217
soon enough.

00:08:16,283 --> 00:08:18,017
BRASS: Drop the Woodward
and Bernstein act, okay?

00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:22,383
Your source, Walter Burns,
was found dead last night.

00:08:23,483 --> 00:08:25,983
Oh...

00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:27,983
Your phone records indicate
you were the last person

00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,250
to speak with him.

00:08:30,317 --> 00:08:32,117
So?

00:08:33,817 --> 00:08:36,050
What happened?

00:08:36,117 --> 00:08:37,883
I'm not at liberty to say.

00:08:38,983 --> 00:08:41,983
Fair enough.

00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:44,183
How about a little
give and take?

00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,750
I help you,
you help me.

00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:47,683
Starting with
how Walter died.

00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,850
No. Let's start with what you

00:08:48,917 --> 00:08:50,017
and Walter talked about
last night.

00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:52,050
We talked
about Cable Springs.

00:08:52,117 --> 00:08:54,550
About his ranch, his health.

00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,483
Your turn.

00:08:59,383 --> 00:09:01,657
Walter was a very sick man.

00:09:01,723 --> 00:09:03,490
You do an autopsy?

00:09:03,557 --> 00:09:05,190
Yes.

00:09:05,257 --> 00:09:08,590
He was riddled with systemic
lesions, amongst other things.

00:09:08,657 --> 00:09:10,523
Can I see the report?

00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:11,657
Can I see your story?

00:09:11,723 --> 00:09:13,157
Do I need to remind you

00:09:13,223 --> 00:09:14,923
of my First Amendment rights?

00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:16,923
Ms. Johnson, we can
get a court order

00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,323
and subpoena your notes
and sources.

00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,090
And I'll go to jail
before I give them up.

00:09:20,157 --> 00:09:21,523
(annoyed sigh)

00:09:23,123 --> 00:09:24,490
Am I free to go?

00:09:24,557 --> 00:09:25,990
Just don't go far.

00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:30,590
(clears throat)

00:09:30,657 --> 00:09:32,423
Oh, um,
Walter's wife was sick, too.

00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:34,223
You might want
to look into that.

00:09:36,257 --> 00:09:38,890
That's on the house.

00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,657
Reporters.

00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:46,223
STOKES:
Hey, Archie.

00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:47,457
Hey.

00:09:48,282 --> 00:09:50,082
I got your text.
What's going on?

00:09:50,149 --> 00:09:52,282
This vehicle.

00:09:52,349 --> 00:09:54,182
Found in an empty lot
near Fremont.

00:09:54,249 --> 00:09:55,649
No driver.

00:09:55,716 --> 00:09:57,949
It looks like blood
on the outside here.

00:09:58,016 --> 00:09:59,016
Yeah, that's never good.

00:09:59,082 --> 00:10:00,716
We can't get to it
right now, man.

00:10:00,782 --> 00:10:01,982
We're working
the Walter Burns case.

00:10:02,049 --> 00:10:04,189
This <i>is--the Walter Burns case.</i>

00:10:04,256 --> 00:10:06,156
He drove a pickup.
I know.

00:10:06,222 --> 00:10:07,422
Check this out.

00:10:07,489 --> 00:10:08,789
This Escalade is equipped

00:10:08,856 --> 00:10:10,856
with an aftermarket
navigation system.

00:10:10,922 --> 00:10:13,289
It's full of goodies.

00:10:13,356 --> 00:10:16,522
Okay, what are you
looking at right now?

00:10:16,589 --> 00:10:20,256
1901 Old Ranch Road,
Cable Springs.

00:10:20,322 --> 00:10:22,189
That's Walter Burns' property.

00:10:22,256 --> 00:10:23,656
Who's the registered owner?

00:10:24,922 --> 00:10:26,289
Richard Adams.

00:10:26,356 --> 00:10:27,889
Also from Cable Springs.

00:10:27,956 --> 00:10:30,589
Been to Walter Burns' property
half a dozen times.

00:10:30,656 --> 00:10:32,022
STOKES:Really?

00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:34,189
What about
the hot springs, last night?

00:10:34,256 --> 00:10:35,956
No.

00:10:36,022 --> 00:10:37,922
According to the system,
the last trip started

00:10:37,989 --> 00:10:39,922
in Cable Springs

00:10:39,989 --> 00:10:42,289
around Main Street, and ended

00:10:42,356 --> 00:10:43,922
just around Fremont
and Nordling

00:10:43,989 --> 00:10:45,889
where the cops found it.

00:10:45,956 --> 00:10:47,789
Positive for blood.

00:10:54,822 --> 00:10:57,822
Expended nine millimeter
cartridge casing.

00:10:57,889 --> 00:10:59,989
Ejector and extractor marks

00:11:00,056 --> 00:11:03,162
are consistent with a Beretta,
or a Taurus semi-auto.

00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:06,262
So the gun is fired
inside the car,

00:11:06,329 --> 00:11:08,796
but instead of the blood
being on the inside,

00:11:08,862 --> 00:11:10,462
it's on the outside.

00:11:15,229 --> 00:11:16,962
Amylase bubbles.

00:11:17,029 --> 00:11:18,996
Amylase indicates saliva.

00:11:19,062 --> 00:11:21,896
That's consistent with
a gunshot wound to the chest.

00:11:21,962 --> 00:11:23,296
You know, I'm thinking,

00:11:23,362 --> 00:11:25,729
the shooter sat right
here in this seat,

00:11:25,796 --> 00:11:27,462
told the driver
to get out.

00:11:27,529 --> 00:11:30,596
(panting):
Please... don't...

00:11:30,662 --> 00:11:33,062
don't do this.
I... I have a family.

00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:37,562
STOKES:
<i>During expiration, blood is</i>

00:11:37,629 --> 00:11:38,762
<i>forced into the throat,</i>

00:11:38,829 --> 00:11:40,462
<i>which induces violent coughing,</i>

00:11:40,529 --> 00:11:41,929
<i>breaking the blood up</i>

00:11:41,996 --> 00:11:44,329
<i>into tiny droplets
that mix with amylase,</i>

00:11:44,396 --> 00:11:46,229
<i>aka saliva.</i>

00:11:46,296 --> 00:11:49,329
Assuming Richard Adams
is the victim,

00:11:49,396 --> 00:11:50,996
what happened to him?

00:11:51,062 --> 00:11:52,596
JOHNSON: Cops searched the area
around the lot.

00:11:52,662 --> 00:11:53,962
They didn't find anything.

00:11:54,029 --> 00:11:56,296
No... body, no blood pool.

00:11:56,362 --> 00:11:57,829
So where did all this happen?

00:11:57,896 --> 00:12:00,529
I'm betting
the answer's in here.

00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:09,169
Nothing throws cold
water on a guy's libido

00:12:09,236 --> 00:12:12,269
like a couple of cops out
for a midnight stroll.

00:12:12,336 --> 00:12:14,936
Hey, Sheila,
roll up the sidewalk.

00:12:15,002 --> 00:12:16,702
We're gonna be a while.

00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:19,269
You, hey, different story;
zero tolerance.

00:12:19,336 --> 00:12:23,736
I see you again, I'm gonna give
you a ride home to your wife.

00:12:23,802 --> 00:12:25,836
That's good PR.

00:12:25,902 --> 00:12:28,002
I try.

00:12:28,069 --> 00:12:29,969
I spoke with Richard
Adams' wife.

00:12:30,036 --> 00:12:33,402
She said he called
her last night around
8:00 from the office.

00:12:33,469 --> 00:12:36,102
The guy's an engineer
with a local gas company--

00:12:36,169 --> 00:12:37,436
Conservo Solutions.

00:12:37,502 --> 00:12:39,769
He said he was
on his way home.

00:12:39,836 --> 00:12:41,269
Where's his office?

00:12:41,336 --> 00:12:42,869
Cable Springs.

00:12:42,936 --> 00:12:44,536
Yeah? On Main Street?

00:12:44,602 --> 00:12:46,802
What, do you do
tarot readings on the side?

00:12:46,869 --> 00:12:48,069
Ha-ha.

00:12:48,136 --> 00:12:50,902
Adams lives and works
in Cable Springs.

00:12:50,969 --> 00:12:52,769
This ain't Cable Springs.

00:12:52,836 --> 00:12:54,769
No, it is not.

00:12:54,836 --> 00:12:57,436
MAN:
Hey!
Uh, excuse me.

00:12:57,502 --> 00:12:58,802
Carry on.

00:12:58,869 --> 00:13:00,902
Well, the navigation
system in his car

00:13:00,969 --> 00:13:03,742
said he stopped around here
for a couple minutes.

00:13:03,809 --> 00:13:05,876
To remove the blood spatter
from the car.

00:13:05,942 --> 00:13:08,176
I figure him for
a $50 recreational detour.

00:13:08,242 --> 00:13:10,942
Mm. Maybe that's what the
killer wanted us to think.

00:13:11,009 --> 00:13:13,342
REED: So they abduct him
from his office,

00:13:13,409 --> 00:13:15,542
and they drive him to Vegas,
to Hooker Alley?

00:13:15,609 --> 00:13:17,576
That's premeditation.

00:13:17,642 --> 00:13:19,776
Here we go.

00:13:22,109 --> 00:13:24,709
Looks like we got
some blood here.

00:13:41,842 --> 00:13:44,342
Divot in the pavement,
some dry blood...

00:13:44,409 --> 00:13:48,776
Looks like a piece of bone--
I think it's skull fragment.

00:13:48,842 --> 00:13:50,909
<i>You know, Adams was
probably already down</i>

00:13:50,976 --> 00:13:53,376
<i>when he was shot
the second time.</i>

00:14:00,442 --> 00:14:02,282
Spent casing.

00:14:03,382 --> 00:14:05,515
Head stamp nine mil.

00:14:05,582 --> 00:14:07,315
Yeah, it's the same brand

00:14:07,382 --> 00:14:09,615
as the nine mil I found
in Adams' car.

00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,082
So the guy has been
shot at least twice.

00:14:12,149 --> 00:14:14,082
Body couldn't be far.

00:14:14,149 --> 00:14:15,449
Uh-huh.

00:14:17,849 --> 00:14:19,782
STOKES:
Drag marks.

00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:36,749
Well, there he is.

00:14:36,815 --> 00:14:37,915
Hello, Richard.

00:14:46,049 --> 00:14:47,816
(Reed sighs)

00:14:49,016 --> 00:14:50,616
Pretty wife.

00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:53,616
Wonder if he called
anybody else last night.

00:14:54,716 --> 00:14:56,349
Bingo.

00:14:58,049 --> 00:15:00,049
What, you just gonna
call it right now?

00:15:00,116 --> 00:15:01,949
(line ringing)
All right.

00:15:02,016 --> 00:15:04,756
JOHNSON (recording):
You've reached Rosalind Johnson

00:15:04,822 --> 00:15:06,756
at the <i>Cable Springs Courier.</i>

00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:08,322
I can't take
your call right now,

00:15:08,389 --> 00:15:10,756
but if you leave a message,
I'll get back to you.

00:15:10,822 --> 00:15:12,322
So, Richard Adams,
our dead engineer here,

00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:14,456
knew Walter Burns,
our dead rancher.

00:15:14,522 --> 00:15:16,489
Adams was killed less
than a day after Burns,

00:15:16,556 --> 00:15:19,156
and they both made
one final call to
Rosalind Johnson?

00:15:19,222 --> 00:15:21,989
She sure has a knack for
interviewing dead guys.

00:15:22,056 --> 00:15:25,022
Two dead bodies in 24 hours.

00:15:25,089 --> 00:15:29,622
That must be one hell
of a story she's writing.

00:15:41,289 --> 00:15:43,456
WOMAN:
Richard had been on edge

00:15:43,522 --> 00:15:45,222
for weeks.

00:15:45,289 --> 00:15:47,489
Even my sister
noticed it.

00:15:47,556 --> 00:15:49,756
He would check
the locks at night,

00:15:49,822 --> 00:15:51,822
and then he would
check them again.

00:15:51,889 --> 00:15:54,522
(sighs) He was convinced
that someone was following him,

00:15:54,589 --> 00:15:56,356
but he wouldn't
tell me who.

00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:59,622
Your husband was an engineer
at Conservo Solutions.

00:15:59,689 --> 00:16:01,556
What exactly
did he do there?

00:16:01,622 --> 00:16:03,562
He was a safety inspector.

00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,096
Conservo Solution's
drilling for natural gas

00:16:06,162 --> 00:16:08,162
in... the neighborhood,

00:16:08,229 --> 00:16:09,729
and so he would go
around to the ranches,

00:16:09,796 --> 00:16:13,796
and he would... just make sure
there were no problems.

00:16:13,862 --> 00:16:17,529
He went to visit a rancher named
Walter Burns several times.

00:16:17,596 --> 00:16:20,162
He visited a lot of ranchers.

00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,296
Anyone who complained.

00:16:22,362 --> 00:16:23,829
What did they complain about?

00:16:25,029 --> 00:16:27,262
(sighs)
You have to ask the company.

00:16:29,796 --> 00:16:33,029
What can you tell me about
a woman named Rosalind Johnson?

00:16:33,096 --> 00:16:34,862
You mean that reporter?

00:16:34,929 --> 00:16:37,362
She was in close contact
with your husband.

00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:39,196
She called him
the night he died.

00:16:39,262 --> 00:16:41,096
She called him all the time.

00:16:41,162 --> 00:16:43,096
She was working on some story.

00:16:43,162 --> 00:16:45,696
And are you certain that was the
extent of their relationship?

00:16:45,762 --> 00:16:49,096
Are you suggesting he was
having an affair with her?

00:16:49,162 --> 00:16:50,796
No. No way.

00:16:50,862 --> 00:16:52,462
Richard didn't even
want to talk to her,

00:16:52,529 --> 00:16:53,529
but she was so pushy.

00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:55,129
And do you know
what they talked about?

00:16:55,196 --> 00:16:57,462
The woman had a bug up her ass
about the drilling.

00:16:57,529 --> 00:16:59,296
She was convinced
that it wasn't...

00:16:59,362 --> 00:17:00,729
That it wasn't what?

00:17:03,936 --> 00:17:06,702
I can't talk to you
about company business.

00:17:06,769 --> 00:17:08,136
Ms. Adams...

00:17:08,202 --> 00:17:09,636
Conservo Solution employees
and their families

00:17:09,702 --> 00:17:12,236
all sign
nondisclosure agreements.

00:17:12,302 --> 00:17:15,836
If I violate it, I will
lose all of Richard's benefits.

00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:18,769
I can't afford that;
I have a son in college.

00:17:18,836 --> 00:17:22,869
Ms. Adams... someone
has murdered your husband.

00:17:22,936 --> 00:17:25,602
Now, if you know something,
you gotta tell me.

00:17:28,136 --> 00:17:31,236
What, did somebody threaten you?

00:17:31,302 --> 00:17:32,636
Hmm?

00:17:32,702 --> 00:17:34,702
Someone from that company?

00:17:37,436 --> 00:17:39,902
(whispers):
Not from the company.

00:17:41,669 --> 00:17:43,702
(flies buzzing)

00:17:48,502 --> 00:17:50,736
STOKES:
Goat's head?!

00:17:50,802 --> 00:17:54,236
Someone left this
on your front porch?

00:17:54,302 --> 00:17:56,102
When?

00:17:56,169 --> 00:17:58,402
The day before yesterday.

00:17:58,469 --> 00:18:00,236
The day before
your husband died?

00:18:02,709 --> 00:18:04,709
Okay.

00:18:04,776 --> 00:18:08,709
Was it in this bag
when you found it?
No, it was in that box.

00:18:15,709 --> 00:18:18,176
(spritzing)

00:18:18,242 --> 00:18:23,076
Bug spray should keep the
creepy crawlies contained.

00:18:23,142 --> 00:18:25,509
Second instar maggots.

00:18:25,576 --> 00:18:28,376
Been dead at least 24 hours.

00:18:28,442 --> 00:18:30,542
This looks like a hatchet job.

00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,742
Tissue's necrotic.

00:18:32,809 --> 00:18:35,209
No contusions on the wounds
caused by the hatchet.

00:18:35,276 --> 00:18:37,109
Yeah, this animal was dead

00:18:37,176 --> 00:18:39,976
before someone separated it
from its head.

00:18:44,909 --> 00:18:47,776
ROBBINS:
Oh, dear. Ooh.

00:18:47,842 --> 00:18:51,342
Dozens of lesions, just like
our floater Walter Burns.

00:18:51,409 --> 00:18:53,509
Could they have had
the same disease?

00:18:53,576 --> 00:18:56,076
Well, maybe it's
our goat's C.O.D.

00:18:56,142 --> 00:18:57,409
LANGSTON:
Why would you leave

00:18:57,476 --> 00:18:59,476
an infected goat's head
on someone's doorstep?

00:18:59,542 --> 00:19:01,042
I'll take that one.

00:19:01,109 --> 00:19:04,849
I've seen <i>The Godfather--11
times-- this was a message.</i>

00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:06,782
Ah.
It's not a horse head,

00:19:06,849 --> 00:19:08,716
but, uh, hey,
times are tough.

00:19:08,782 --> 00:19:11,349
So we have...

00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:13,749
a rancher and a goat

00:19:13,816 --> 00:19:15,716
showing similar
gross pathology,

00:19:15,782 --> 00:19:20,549
both with connections
to Cable Springs and...

00:19:20,616 --> 00:19:21,982
the Conservo engineer.

00:19:22,049 --> 00:19:25,116
So we'll let this culture
grow overnight.

00:19:25,182 --> 00:19:27,416
I already popped some
lesion pus from a rancher,

00:19:27,482 --> 00:19:28,982
and I'll pull his tissue slides

00:19:29,049 --> 00:19:30,516
for comparison.

00:19:30,582 --> 00:19:33,882
And maybe we'll get an answer
to this medical mystery.

00:19:38,282 --> 00:19:41,049
♪ ♪

00:20:03,089 --> 00:20:04,622
How's it going?

00:20:04,689 --> 00:20:07,822
Found a bloody print
on the inside of the box.

00:20:07,889 --> 00:20:09,422
Blood's not human.

00:20:09,489 --> 00:20:10,922
It's all goat's blood?

00:20:10,989 --> 00:20:13,456
Well, as soon as they
develop a presumptive test

00:20:13,522 --> 00:20:15,422
for goat's blood,
I'll let you know.

00:20:15,489 --> 00:20:17,689
But in the meantime,
the print's pretty good.

00:20:17,756 --> 00:20:21,589
It's got a right-slant loop,
a core and a delta.

00:20:21,656 --> 00:20:23,856
It's AFIS quality.
JOHNSON:
I've been downloading

00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:26,022
all the images from
Richard Adams' cell phone.

00:20:26,089 --> 00:20:28,522
You got to see this.

00:20:32,589 --> 00:20:34,422
That's my goat.
You sure?

00:20:34,489 --> 00:20:37,489
Yeah, the left horn is damaged,
just like the one I found.

00:20:40,089 --> 00:20:41,222
See there?

00:20:41,289 --> 00:20:42,489
Hey, did you

00:20:42,556 --> 00:20:44,889
get latitude and longitude
within the metadata?

00:20:44,956 --> 00:20:47,089
Sorry.
Haven't gotten that far yet.

00:20:47,156 --> 00:20:49,656
I was getting
a little excited.

00:20:49,722 --> 00:20:53,589
There we go--
1903 Old Ranch Road.

00:20:53,656 --> 00:20:56,022
That's right down the road
from Walter Burns' property.

00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:58,156
Well, maybe his neighbor's got
the rest of your billy goat.

00:20:58,222 --> 00:21:00,689
And the nine millimeter
and the truck with an oil leak.

00:21:00,756 --> 00:21:04,429
You think he killed Walter Burns
<i>and--Richard Adams?</i>

00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:06,429
I'll ask him
when I get there.

00:21:06,496 --> 00:21:08,229
I'll run the print.
All right.

00:21:33,796 --> 00:21:35,762
Gas company's drilling
right in his lap.

00:21:35,829 --> 00:21:38,329
I checked out the owner
of this place, Bill Gibson.

00:21:38,396 --> 00:21:40,196
No priors. He's been
here for 40 years.

00:21:40,262 --> 00:21:43,329
His work card's on file.
Well, if his prints
are on that box,

00:21:43,396 --> 00:21:45,796
Greg should be able
to get a match.

00:21:45,862 --> 00:21:47,896
It's not exactly
a thriving enterprise.

00:21:47,962 --> 00:21:50,029
I didn't see
any livestock.

00:21:50,096 --> 00:21:51,462
What do you got, Nick?

00:21:51,529 --> 00:21:53,129
No oil leak.

00:21:53,196 --> 00:21:55,029
But he could've fixed it by now.

00:21:55,096 --> 00:21:57,196
Let's see if
Mr. Gibson's here.

00:21:59,896 --> 00:22:01,796
(rifle blast)

00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:04,769
I got point--
don't shoot me in the ass.

00:22:07,702 --> 00:22:09,836
Mr. Gibson, LVPD!

00:22:16,436 --> 00:22:19,302
What the hell you people
doing on my property?

00:22:19,369 --> 00:22:22,902
Sir, put the animal down;
show me your hands.

00:22:30,102 --> 00:22:32,669
You want to tell me
what this is about?

00:22:32,736 --> 00:22:34,736
Why don't you tell us
why you shot that goat?

00:22:34,802 --> 00:22:36,369
'Cause he was sick,

00:22:36,436 --> 00:22:38,536
and I'm putting him
out of his misery.

00:22:38,602 --> 00:22:40,036
You gonna cut
that one's head off, too?

00:22:40,102 --> 00:22:41,702
Throw it on somebody's porch?

00:22:41,769 --> 00:22:44,636
Is that why you're here, you
think I killed that engineer?

00:22:44,702 --> 00:22:45,702
Did you?
No!

00:22:45,769 --> 00:22:46,902
What about
your neighbor,

00:22:46,969 --> 00:22:48,469
Walter Burns?

00:22:48,536 --> 00:22:51,736
Walter was a friend,
so was his wife.

00:22:51,802 --> 00:22:53,302
In a way,

00:22:53,369 --> 00:22:54,436
he was lucky.

00:22:54,502 --> 00:22:56,602
He got put out
of his misery, too.

00:22:56,669 --> 00:22:58,436
Sir, we're gonna need you
to come to Vegas

00:22:58,502 --> 00:22:59,469
and answer some questions.

00:22:59,536 --> 00:23:01,336
This place may
not look like much,

00:23:01,402 --> 00:23:03,209
but there's only one way
I'm leaving.

00:23:03,276 --> 00:23:05,176
I don't want
to shoot you, sir.

00:23:05,242 --> 00:23:06,242
We don't want

00:23:06,309 --> 00:23:08,242
any trouble, now,
Mr. Gibson.

00:23:08,309 --> 00:23:10,742
But trouble's all I got, son.
LANGSTON:
Mr. Gibson,

00:23:10,809 --> 00:23:12,809
you haven't been feeling
well lately, have you?

00:23:12,876 --> 00:23:15,242
What do you care?

00:23:15,309 --> 00:23:17,709
You know, 40 years,

00:23:17,776 --> 00:23:20,309
I get good, sweet
water from my well.

00:23:20,376 --> 00:23:21,542
40 years!

00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:23,409
You want to know how
much the gas company

00:23:23,476 --> 00:23:26,409
paid me for my mineral rights?

00:23:26,476 --> 00:23:28,809
$50,000.

00:23:28,876 --> 00:23:30,709
Only covered

00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:33,042
one round of my wife's chemo.

00:23:33,109 --> 00:23:34,276
Your wife had cancer?

00:23:34,342 --> 00:23:35,742
Just like Walter's wife,

00:23:35,809 --> 00:23:38,109
like a whole lot of
other people around here.

00:23:38,176 --> 00:23:41,642
You know, I called...
the Water District,

00:23:41,709 --> 00:23:44,876
the mayor, the EPA,
but nobody cared.

00:23:44,942 --> 00:23:46,476
We care, Mr. Gibson.

00:23:46,542 --> 00:23:48,476
Now, Walter was gonna get proof

00:23:48,542 --> 00:23:51,442
that Conservo Solutions
was poisoning us!

00:23:51,509 --> 00:23:53,576
Then he turns up dead!

00:23:53,642 --> 00:23:55,442
Sir, I'm not
gonna ask you again.

00:23:55,509 --> 00:23:57,442
You won't have to.

00:23:59,676 --> 00:24:01,782
I buried my wife.

00:24:04,649 --> 00:24:06,649
Now I'm burying my last animal.

00:24:06,716 --> 00:24:08,749
I ain't got nothin' left.

00:24:08,816 --> 00:24:10,816
Oh, and now you folks

00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:13,782
from the county
finally come down here,

00:24:13,849 --> 00:24:15,882
accuse me of murder.

00:24:15,949 --> 00:24:18,082
We only want to understand
what's going on.

00:24:18,149 --> 00:24:19,849
You want to understand?

00:24:22,316 --> 00:24:24,216
Let me show you.

00:24:24,282 --> 00:24:26,049
(explosion)

00:24:46,674 --> 00:24:48,208
I don't see any evidence

00:24:48,274 --> 00:24:50,508
of any kind of explosive
device in there.

00:24:50,574 --> 00:24:52,408
I don't mean to insult
your intelligence,

00:24:52,474 --> 00:24:54,908
but water's not supposed
to blow up like that.

00:24:54,974 --> 00:24:58,541
Wasn't there a river
in Ohio a long time ago

00:24:58,608 --> 00:25:01,374
that was so polluted
that it caught on fire?

00:25:01,441 --> 00:25:03,881
The Cuyahoga,
just outside of Cleveland.

00:25:03,948 --> 00:25:06,348
You know, I had
a cousin who lived there.

00:25:06,414 --> 00:25:08,814
He said the water
didn't flow, it oozed.

00:25:08,881 --> 00:25:11,381
Said if you
got in that river water,

00:25:11,448 --> 00:25:13,314
you'd probably dissolve
before you'd drown.

00:25:13,381 --> 00:25:15,581
It's what started
the Clean Water Act.

00:25:15,648 --> 00:25:17,414
Maybe we got the
same thing here.

00:25:17,481 --> 00:25:18,881
Maybe.

00:25:19,981 --> 00:25:21,481
What are you thinking?

00:25:21,548 --> 00:25:23,481
Well...

00:25:25,514 --> 00:25:27,448
I don't mean to insult

00:25:27,514 --> 00:25:30,114
<i>your--intelligence,
 Nick, but...</i>

00:25:30,181 --> 00:25:34,114
water's not supposed to bubble
like that unless it's Perrier.

00:25:35,348 --> 00:25:37,381
Smell that.

00:25:37,448 --> 00:25:38,814
Serious chemical odor.

00:25:38,881 --> 00:25:40,981
Yeah, I smell it--
but the main component

00:25:41,048 --> 00:25:43,148
of natural gas is methane,
and it's odorless.

00:25:43,214 --> 00:25:45,114
Odorless...
but highly flammable.

00:25:46,881 --> 00:25:48,614
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:25:48,681 --> 00:25:51,048
What are you doing?
Just a little
science. Relax.

00:25:52,514 --> 00:25:54,914
You're a smart guy.

00:25:59,014 --> 00:26:00,514
So...

00:26:00,581 --> 00:26:05,788
Mr. Gibson's water
contains methane.

00:26:05,854 --> 00:26:07,988
Yeah, and who knows what else?
Well, I'd bet

00:26:08,054 --> 00:26:10,321
that it's that "what else"
that's got all these people

00:26:10,388 --> 00:26:12,488
around here
and their animals sick.

00:26:22,421 --> 00:26:25,421
Ms. Johnson,
would you come inside, please?

00:26:27,288 --> 00:26:29,221
I heard
Bill Gibson is dead.

00:26:29,288 --> 00:26:31,221
I'm not authorized
to make public statements

00:26:31,288 --> 00:26:32,554
about an active
investigation.

00:26:32,621 --> 00:26:34,088
What the hell happened?

00:26:34,154 --> 00:26:35,654
You have to talk to the PIO.

00:26:35,721 --> 00:26:38,121
Thanks for your time.

00:26:38,188 --> 00:26:39,454
I <i>can--talk off the record.</i>

00:26:42,688 --> 00:26:43,954
Please.

00:26:54,054 --> 00:26:55,654
So, talk.

00:26:55,721 --> 00:26:58,788
There's a problem with
Bill Gibson's well water.

00:26:58,854 --> 00:27:00,821
We suspect there's
a similar problem

00:27:00,888 --> 00:27:03,461
with the well water in
the surrounding ranches.

00:27:03,528 --> 00:27:05,128
Tell me something
that everybody

00:27:05,194 --> 00:27:07,428
in Cable Springs
doesn't already know.
All right.

00:27:07,494 --> 00:27:10,894
Richard Adams was the
engineer who ran the
safety inspections.

00:27:10,961 --> 00:27:13,294
The GPS on his Escalade

00:27:13,361 --> 00:27:16,194
showed that he visited ranches
in the surrounding area.

00:27:16,261 --> 00:27:18,861
He knew there was a
problem with the water.

00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:21,328
Which means Conservo
knew as well.

00:27:21,394 --> 00:27:23,394
I could have told you that.

00:27:23,461 --> 00:27:25,228
Ms. Johnson,
can you tell me

00:27:25,294 --> 00:27:28,828
why you think Bill Gibson,
Walter Burns and Richard Adams

00:27:28,894 --> 00:27:30,428
are all dead?

00:27:33,494 --> 00:27:35,061
Because...

00:27:35,128 --> 00:27:38,394
they figured out a year ago what
you're just figuring out now.

00:27:38,461 --> 00:27:43,061
Conservo was taking shortcuts,
ignoring safety protocols.

00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:45,928
Gibson and Burns tried
to do something about it.

00:27:45,994 --> 00:27:47,561
Did you know they
were both sick?

00:27:47,628 --> 00:27:51,028
Lots of sick people
in Cable Springs.

00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:54,428
Have you seen your
doctor recently?

00:27:57,294 --> 00:27:59,828
Yeah.

00:27:59,894 --> 00:28:02,568
You can read about it
in my article.

00:28:02,634 --> 00:28:04,801
Which is coming out when?

00:28:04,868 --> 00:28:08,634
Unfortunately,
all my sources keep dying on me.

00:28:08,701 --> 00:28:12,334
And I'm still missing one
crucial piece of the puzzle.

00:28:12,401 --> 00:28:15,001
Have you ever heard
of "fracking"?

00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:17,301
Sounds like a sci-fi expletive.

00:28:17,368 --> 00:28:19,234
Look it up.

00:28:19,301 --> 00:28:21,401
And then give me a call.

00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:24,734
Very well.

00:28:27,934 --> 00:28:30,201
(sighs)

00:28:35,834 --> 00:28:36,801
(knocking)

00:28:36,868 --> 00:28:38,801
I'm not gonna
touch anything.

00:28:38,868 --> 00:28:40,534
Good.

00:28:40,601 --> 00:28:42,434
Those the results

00:28:42,501 --> 00:28:44,468
from the water samples?
Yeah.

00:28:44,534 --> 00:28:46,568
Hand 'em over.

00:28:46,634 --> 00:28:49,601
I analyzed the sample

00:28:49,668 --> 00:28:51,801
we collected from
Mr. Gibson's well.

00:28:51,868 --> 00:28:54,101
Methane, fumaric acid,

00:28:54,168 --> 00:28:56,368
barite, ammonium silicate...

00:28:58,368 --> 00:29:00,068
Glutaraldehyde?! Benzene?!

00:29:00,134 --> 00:29:01,468
Huge carcinogen.

00:29:01,534 --> 00:29:05,108
5-Chloro-2-methyl-4-
isothiazolin-3-one.

00:29:05,174 --> 00:29:08,341
All of these chemicals
are implicated

00:29:08,408 --> 00:29:11,608
in cardiovascular
and respiratory disorder,

00:29:11,674 --> 00:29:15,341
endocrine disruption,
gastroenterological failure,

00:29:15,408 --> 00:29:16,841
nerve and urinary
system destruction...

00:29:16,908 --> 00:29:19,608
Yeah, uh, bad for
you-- I get it.
I've been examining

00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:23,808
the bacterial culture
for Mr. Burns' brain lesions.

00:29:23,874 --> 00:29:25,274
Come on over here.

00:29:25,341 --> 00:29:26,308
Come on.

00:29:27,408 --> 00:29:28,674
This way.

00:29:30,108 --> 00:29:32,074
Take a look.

00:29:33,341 --> 00:29:35,874
I don't need
a mask, do I?

00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:37,541
No.

00:29:42,308 --> 00:29:43,374
Ooh.

00:29:43,441 --> 00:29:44,708
Nasty.

00:29:44,774 --> 00:29:47,041
I'd hate to have those
floating around my colon.

00:29:47,108 --> 00:29:48,274
Or anywhere else.

00:29:48,341 --> 00:29:49,641
They like necrotic tissue.

00:29:49,708 --> 00:29:51,908
But the real story
is in the histo.

00:29:51,974 --> 00:29:55,241
The slides confirm Walter
Burns was suffering

00:29:55,308 --> 00:29:56,774
from metastatic carcinoma.

00:29:56,841 --> 00:29:59,508
I pulled the clinical
autopsy reports

00:29:59,574 --> 00:30:01,808
on Gibson's wife
and Mrs. Burns--

00:30:01,874 --> 00:30:04,681
they both died
from metastatic carcinomas.

00:30:04,748 --> 00:30:08,448
Because maybe...
they were drinking bad water.

00:30:08,514 --> 00:30:11,181
This is the analysis
from the water found

00:30:11,248 --> 00:30:14,114
in the vocal folds
of your hot springs floater.

00:30:14,181 --> 00:30:16,281
You see, it's the same toxins,

00:30:16,348 --> 00:30:18,314
but much higher concentrations.

00:30:18,381 --> 00:30:20,181
ROBBINS:
So Walter Burns

00:30:20,248 --> 00:30:24,514
may have drowned in the
<i>source--of the contamination.</i>

00:30:24,581 --> 00:30:26,781
If these chemicals
are in the water supply

00:30:26,848 --> 00:30:29,481
in Cable Springs, we have
a major public health emergency.

00:30:29,548 --> 00:30:30,914
We need to warn people.

00:30:30,981 --> 00:30:32,914
And tell them what?

00:30:32,981 --> 00:30:34,914
A water sample from one well

00:30:34,981 --> 00:30:36,881
is hardly proof of
widespread contamination.

00:30:36,948 --> 00:30:38,981
I found it.What?

00:30:39,048 --> 00:30:41,081
What Rosalind Johnson was
talking about-- fracking.

00:30:41,148 --> 00:30:43,081
It's short for
hydraulic fracturing.

00:30:43,148 --> 00:30:48,414
It's a process used to obtain
natural gas from shale rock.

00:30:49,814 --> 00:30:52,881
Conservo Solutions pioneered
the process in Nevada.

00:30:52,948 --> 00:30:55,848
They drill until they hit
gas-bearing shale.

00:30:55,914 --> 00:30:58,748
Then they pump millions
of gallons of water, sand

00:30:58,814 --> 00:31:00,414
and chemicals into the hole.

00:31:00,481 --> 00:31:02,721
This creates
miniature earthquakes

00:31:02,788 --> 00:31:04,388
breaking up the rock,
releasing the gas.

00:31:04,454 --> 00:31:07,621
WILLOWS: So they're
drilling right through

00:31:07,688 --> 00:31:08,854
the aquifer in Cable Springs,

00:31:08,921 --> 00:31:10,021
where everyone gets
their drinking water.

00:31:10,088 --> 00:31:11,488
What happens
to all the chemicals

00:31:11,554 --> 00:31:13,388
they put down the hole?
It says here

00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:16,088
that half the fracking fluid
comes up with the gas,

00:31:16,154 --> 00:31:18,554
gets pumped
into an evaporation pool.

00:31:20,854 --> 00:31:22,588
And the rest
remains underground?

00:31:22,654 --> 00:31:25,254
If industry safety protocols
aren't followed,

00:31:25,321 --> 00:31:28,121
methane in the fracking fluid
enters the groundwater.

00:31:28,188 --> 00:31:30,554
Which means that if
a farmer or a rancher

00:31:30,621 --> 00:31:32,154
is pumping water
from his well,

00:31:32,221 --> 00:31:35,021
<i>gas comes up with it,
it mixes with the air--</i>

00:31:35,088 --> 00:31:37,721
<i>it creates an extremely
combustible mixture.</i>

00:31:46,088 --> 00:31:48,954
Well, Conservo Solutions
had to file

00:31:49,021 --> 00:31:51,721
an environmental impact study
before they started drilling.

00:31:51,788 --> 00:31:53,854
There was no study.

00:31:53,921 --> 00:31:56,321
Since 2005, gas companies
haven't been bound

00:31:56,388 --> 00:31:59,354
by the Clean Water Act,
the Safe Drinking Water Act,

00:31:59,421 --> 00:32:01,388
or the National
Environmental Policy Act.

00:32:01,454 --> 00:32:04,361
So I'll do my civic duty and
I'll call the Health Department,

00:32:04,428 --> 00:32:06,528
while you guys
are solving crimes.

00:32:06,594 --> 00:32:07,928
The water's the crime.

00:32:07,994 --> 00:32:09,828
Seriously,
it's not <i>Chinatown,--Ray.</i>

00:32:12,661 --> 00:32:14,961
Okay. Be more specific.

00:32:15,028 --> 00:32:18,594
Now, this is a trace
report on the oil

00:32:18,661 --> 00:32:20,728
that Nick found
at the hot springs--
it contained soot,

00:32:20,794 --> 00:32:22,761
which tells us it came
from a diesel engine.

00:32:22,828 --> 00:32:25,261
It also contained titanium
at 114 ppm.

00:32:25,328 --> 00:32:27,428
That's an additive used
in commercial fleets.

00:32:27,494 --> 00:32:29,761
Which tells us it came
from a commercial-grade vehicle.

00:32:29,828 --> 00:32:32,794
The only commercial fleet
in Cable Springs

00:32:32,861 --> 00:32:34,428
belongs to Conservo Solutions.

00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:36,361
WILLOWS:
Richard Adams was

00:32:36,428 --> 00:32:37,561
their employee.

00:32:37,628 --> 00:32:39,228
Walter Burns and Bill Gibson

00:32:39,294 --> 00:32:41,561
both leased their mineral rights
to the company.

00:32:41,628 --> 00:32:43,794
Well, I'm not sure
that's enough for a warrant.

00:32:43,861 --> 00:32:45,228
Whoever drowned
Walter Burns

00:32:45,294 --> 00:32:47,528
was driving
a commercial diesel truck.

00:32:47,594 --> 00:32:49,828
The same person probably
killed Richard Adams.

00:32:49,894 --> 00:32:51,928
WILLOWS:
Get us the warrant,

00:32:51,994 --> 00:32:53,561
Conrad.

00:33:28,968 --> 00:33:30,834
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:33:30,901 --> 00:33:32,834
Can I help you, Officers?

00:33:32,901 --> 00:33:33,968
You sure can, big man.

00:33:34,034 --> 00:33:36,034
I gotta take a look
at your trucks.

00:33:36,101 --> 00:33:37,734
Why?

00:33:37,801 --> 00:33:40,234
'Cause that piece of paper
says so.

00:33:44,134 --> 00:33:46,401
Excuse me.

00:33:46,468 --> 00:33:48,301
Do you guys have a
gym on site, as well?

00:33:48,368 --> 00:33:50,268
What are you talking about?

00:33:50,334 --> 00:33:52,901
Well, I see you have
a nice little lap pool here.

00:33:52,968 --> 00:33:54,634
No, no, no.
That's for the bunny huggers.

00:33:54,701 --> 00:33:56,434
Environmental regs.
It's an evaporation pool.

00:33:56,501 --> 00:33:58,534
For what?

00:33:58,601 --> 00:34:00,934
Stuff we use for drilling,
mostly water.

00:34:01,001 --> 00:34:03,274
We pump it back out
and store it there.

00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:05,274
Fascinating!

00:34:35,941 --> 00:34:38,408
♪ ♪

00:34:41,008 --> 00:34:43,741
Hey, partner, you mind
if I use your truck?

00:35:05,981 --> 00:35:07,181
(shutter clicks)

00:35:08,248 --> 00:35:09,414
Ray!

00:35:09,481 --> 00:35:11,781
Yeah?

00:35:11,848 --> 00:35:14,781
Got what looks like
a piece of a shirt here.

00:35:14,848 --> 00:35:16,181
It's the same pattern

00:35:16,248 --> 00:35:17,614
as the one
that farmer was wearing

00:35:17,681 --> 00:35:19,048
that we pulled
out of the lake.

00:35:19,114 --> 00:35:20,548
Walter Burns?

00:35:20,614 --> 00:35:24,348
Yeah, man.
I think he was here.

00:35:25,981 --> 00:35:28,248
Gibson said that Burns
was going to get proof

00:35:28,314 --> 00:35:30,614
that Conservo Solutions
was poisoning the water.

00:35:30,681 --> 00:35:33,481
The proof is in that
evaporation pool.

00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:35,948
There's a higher concentration
of chemicals there,

00:35:36,014 --> 00:35:37,214
and I bet we can get a match

00:35:37,281 --> 00:35:38,648
to the water we found
in his vocal folds.

00:35:38,714 --> 00:35:40,081
Yeah. Guy rips his shirt
jumping the fence

00:35:40,148 --> 00:35:42,048
'cause he wants to get
a sample out of that pool.

00:35:42,114 --> 00:35:43,181
Somebody spots him,

00:35:43,248 --> 00:35:44,748
hits him in the head
with the butt of a gun.

00:35:44,814 --> 00:35:46,814
He falls in the pool.
He drowns.

00:35:46,881 --> 00:35:48,514
Then they take the body
out to the hot springs

00:35:48,581 --> 00:35:49,648
and dump it there.

00:35:49,714 --> 00:35:51,314
Yeah, I buy that
for a dollar.

00:35:51,381 --> 00:35:52,481
Hey!

00:35:52,548 --> 00:35:53,914
Yeah?
These all
the trucks you have?

00:35:53,981 --> 00:35:56,048
We got a few more
out on the road.

00:35:56,114 --> 00:35:58,048
We need license plates
and drivers' names.

00:35:58,114 --> 00:36:00,914
I gotta call my boss.

00:36:00,981 --> 00:36:02,048
That's gonna take
some time.

00:36:02,114 --> 00:36:04,254
Oh, you take all the
time you need, Hoss.

00:36:04,321 --> 00:36:06,321
Nothing moves till you do.

00:36:06,388 --> 00:36:07,188
(cell phone ringing)

00:36:07,254 --> 00:36:08,788
All right.

00:36:08,854 --> 00:36:10,488
Langston.

00:36:10,554 --> 00:36:11,821
SANDERS:
Hey, Ray.

00:36:11,888 --> 00:36:13,321
Found your leaky truck.

00:36:13,388 --> 00:36:15,654
And then some.

00:36:15,721 --> 00:36:17,288
Blood inside the cab.

00:36:17,354 --> 00:36:21,054
Got a Beretta nine mil
by the driver's seat.

00:36:21,121 --> 00:36:23,788
You hang on to that driver.
We're gonna need to talk to him.

00:36:23,854 --> 00:36:26,488
Yeah?
Well, he's not going anywhere.

00:36:26,554 --> 00:36:28,854
He's not talking, either.

00:36:28,921 --> 00:36:32,421
401A. Hit and run, fatality.

00:36:35,154 --> 00:36:36,288
(camera shutter clicks)

00:36:52,988 --> 00:36:55,254
I have been up and down
this entire godforsaken road

00:36:55,321 --> 00:36:56,421
and nobody has
seen nothing.

00:36:56,488 --> 00:36:57,821
No accidents, no
vehicles, nothing.

00:36:57,888 --> 00:37:00,754
They're all suffering from
retinitis pigmentosa.

00:37:00,821 --> 00:37:02,328
Well, have a look at this.

00:37:02,394 --> 00:37:06,228
The valve's loose,
about a quarter turn.

00:37:06,294 --> 00:37:07,928
Almost never happens
without human intervention.

00:37:07,994 --> 00:37:11,328
I think somebody set up
our trucker Cody Trimble

00:37:11,394 --> 00:37:12,828
to get a flat.

00:37:12,894 --> 00:37:14,594
Slow leak. Tire goes down.

00:37:15,994 --> 00:37:18,994
SANDERS: <i>Trimble gets out
to fix his tire,</i>

00:37:19,061 --> 00:37:20,994
<i>becomes the proverbial
sitting duck.</i>

00:37:21,061 --> 00:37:22,494
(Trimble cries out)

00:37:22,561 --> 00:37:25,628
And that takes care of
Conservo's only loose end.

00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:28,994
This wasn't an accident.

00:37:29,061 --> 00:37:31,228
Firing one.

00:37:51,294 --> 00:37:54,461
STOKES: The back spatter
on this pistol is consistent

00:37:54,528 --> 00:37:55,628
with the dead trucker's gun.

00:37:55,694 --> 00:37:56,794
Right.

00:37:56,861 --> 00:37:58,728
If DNA's a match
for Richard Adams,

00:37:58,794 --> 00:38:00,794
then we've got the murder
weapon and his killer.

00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:01,994
The bullets

00:38:02,061 --> 00:38:05,334
and the cartridge casings
from Adams' Escalade

00:38:05,401 --> 00:38:08,134
and the alley
are both a match.

00:38:08,201 --> 00:38:09,934
This guy Trimble
made our job easy.

00:38:10,001 --> 00:38:13,501
Too easy.

00:38:13,568 --> 00:38:15,468
That's some blood
on the lanyard ring.

00:38:17,401 --> 00:38:19,001
And what looks like
some hair.

00:38:19,068 --> 00:38:22,401
It's the same color
as Walter Burns' hair.

00:38:30,734 --> 00:38:33,334
I think we know what made
Walter Burns' head wound.

00:38:33,401 --> 00:38:36,434
<i>So Burns hopped the fence
at Conservo Solutions,</i>

00:38:36,501 --> 00:38:39,734
<i>hoping to get a water sample
from the evaporation pool.</i>

00:38:44,801 --> 00:38:46,634
(blow thuds, Burns grunts)

00:38:46,701 --> 00:38:49,501
STOKES: <i>But what he got
was a Beretta to the head.</i>

00:38:49,568 --> 00:38:51,301
He drowned in that pool,

00:38:51,368 --> 00:38:53,801
which explains why he
had high concentrations

00:38:53,868 --> 00:38:55,901
of fracking fluid
in his vocal folds.

00:38:55,968 --> 00:38:59,368
Cody Trimble drove Walter's body
out to the hot springs.

00:38:59,434 --> 00:39:01,974
Which we confirmed by the blood
we found in Cody's truck.

00:39:02,041 --> 00:39:03,141
Right. So...

00:39:03,208 --> 00:39:05,741
a Conservo Solutions
trucker with no priors

00:39:05,808 --> 00:39:06,908
goes on a murder spree.

00:39:06,974 --> 00:39:09,774
He kills two Conservo
whistle-blowers.

00:39:09,841 --> 00:39:11,408
He then takes a hit
for the home team?

00:39:13,341 --> 00:39:15,274
That's some serious
company loyalty.

00:39:15,341 --> 00:39:17,274
ECKLIE:
Thank you, gentlemen.

00:39:24,841 --> 00:39:26,808
ECKLIE:
That's it. Case closed.

00:39:26,874 --> 00:39:28,674
What? Seriously?

00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:30,308
You're going to let
some corporate lawyers

00:39:30,374 --> 00:39:31,908
tell us when our
investigation is over?

00:39:31,974 --> 00:39:33,408
No. They're not telling you.
I'm telling you.

00:39:33,474 --> 00:39:35,141
You got your evidence.
You got the bad guy.

00:39:35,208 --> 00:39:36,741
Justice has
been served.

00:39:36,808 --> 00:39:38,041
Well, we still need
a water sample

00:39:38,108 --> 00:39:39,408
from Conservo's
evaporation pool.

00:39:39,474 --> 00:39:41,408
For what?

00:39:41,474 --> 00:39:42,841
Because Walter Burns
drowned in fracking fluid,

00:39:42,908 --> 00:39:44,974
and the only place it can
be found is in that pool.

00:39:45,041 --> 00:39:46,274
You don't need a sample,

00:39:46,341 --> 00:39:47,674
because there's not going
to be a trial.

00:39:47,741 --> 00:39:48,908
Killer's dead.

00:39:48,974 --> 00:39:50,908
Oh, like the engineer
and Walter Burns?

00:39:50,974 --> 00:39:54,241
Another happy accident
for Conservo?

00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:56,108
Et tu, Brass?

00:39:56,174 --> 00:39:58,308
No one can accuse me
of being a bleeding heart,

00:39:58,374 --> 00:40:00,541
but I know that someone
with deep pockets

00:40:00,608 --> 00:40:02,048
hired that trucker
to do their dirty work

00:40:02,114 --> 00:40:03,314
and then disposed of him.

00:40:03,381 --> 00:40:04,748
Don't you want
to nail those bastards?

00:40:04,814 --> 00:40:06,381
Yeah. Of course I do.

00:40:06,448 --> 00:40:08,414
But do you have any evidence
to prove that?

00:40:08,481 --> 00:40:10,981
Bill Gibson blew himself up

00:40:11,048 --> 00:40:12,948
because Conservo Solutions

00:40:13,014 --> 00:40:14,581
took everything
away from him.

00:40:14,648 --> 00:40:16,081
They took his ranch.

00:40:16,148 --> 00:40:18,781
They took his health.
They took his wife.

00:40:18,848 --> 00:40:20,448
And there's hundreds
of Bill Gibsons out there.

00:40:20,514 --> 00:40:23,014
Catherine, you're
a crime scene investigator,

00:40:23,081 --> 00:40:24,348
not Erin Brockovich.

00:40:26,581 --> 00:40:30,648
What about the
hit and run?

00:40:30,714 --> 00:40:31,948
Keep the case open,

00:40:32,014 --> 00:40:34,081
and let me know
if anything else turns up.

00:40:42,514 --> 00:40:44,348
"Fracking"

00:40:44,414 --> 00:40:46,581
is industry slang

00:40:46,648 --> 00:40:47,981
for "hydraulic fracturing."
It's the method

00:40:48,048 --> 00:40:50,581
that Conservo's uses
to drill for natural gas.

00:40:50,648 --> 00:40:52,314
You get a gold star.

00:40:52,381 --> 00:40:53,614
Thank you.

00:40:53,681 --> 00:40:56,248
Walter Burns busted
into Conservo's well site

00:40:56,314 --> 00:40:58,414
to steal a sample
from the evaporation pool.

00:40:58,481 --> 00:41:01,214
That was the missing piece
of your puzzle.

00:41:01,281 --> 00:41:03,754
I tried
to talk Walter out of it.

00:41:03,821 --> 00:41:06,288
I told him I had
a better way--

00:41:06,354 --> 00:41:09,254
an insider who was going to
give me corporate documents.

00:41:09,321 --> 00:41:12,088
Proof that Conservo knew they
were polluting the water

00:41:12,154 --> 00:41:13,554
and they chose
to cover it up.

00:41:13,621 --> 00:41:15,554
And Walter didn't listen.

00:41:15,621 --> 00:41:19,354
Richard Adams got himself killed
before he could deliver.

00:41:19,421 --> 00:41:21,854
I worked Richard
for months.

00:41:21,921 --> 00:41:24,321
He was the one going
to those ranches.

00:41:24,388 --> 00:41:26,688
He was the first to
see people were dying.

00:41:26,754 --> 00:41:29,388
(coughing)

00:41:31,921 --> 00:41:34,988
Short, controlled breaths.

00:41:35,054 --> 00:41:37,221
That's it.
That's it.

00:41:46,288 --> 00:41:50,021
I thought I could expose
Conservo before it was too late.

00:41:53,521 --> 00:41:54,988
I believed that stuff

00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:58,421
about "one person
can change the world."

00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:04,528
Maybe I was wrong.

00:42:06,928 --> 00:42:09,194
I'm not going to quit.

00:42:09,261 --> 00:42:10,961
So what can you do now?

00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:12,761
Publish what I have.

00:42:12,828 --> 00:42:16,294
Rosalind, all you have
are anecdotal accounts.

00:42:16,361 --> 00:42:19,428
If you publish without
the hard evidence to back it up,

00:42:19,494 --> 00:42:20,728
Conservo will bury you.

00:42:20,794 --> 00:42:22,594
They will shut
your newspaper down.

00:42:22,661 --> 00:42:24,594
They will try.

00:42:24,661 --> 00:42:26,594
That's how they win.

00:42:27,761 --> 00:42:29,928
By threatening people.

00:42:29,994 --> 00:42:31,894
Or buying their silence.

00:42:31,961 --> 00:42:33,861
(sighs)

00:42:33,928 --> 00:42:36,594
Fear is their
biggest weapon.

00:42:36,661 --> 00:42:40,261
But... (laughs)
funny thing is,

00:42:40,328 --> 00:42:42,694
I'm not afraid anymore.

00:42:46,828 --> 00:42:48,861
Guess it's 'cause
I don't have much to lose.

00:42:48,928 --> 00:42:51,861
(laughs)

00:42:51,928 --> 00:42:55,128
I have a friend who may
be able to help you.

00:42:55,194 --> 00:42:58,528
She's starting
a clinical trial.

00:42:58,594 --> 00:43:01,001
Holding a slot
open for you.

00:43:09,434 --> 00:43:11,368
Least I could do.
