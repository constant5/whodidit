00:00:09,292 --> 00:00:11,360
LANGSTON:
<i>You see an address?</i>

00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,994
STOKES:
<i>Man, I don't</i>
<i>even see any houses.</i>

00:00:12,994 --> 00:00:14,897
LANGSTON:
<i>I didn't know they had</i>

00:00:14,897 --> 00:00:16,899
this much farmland
outside of Vegas.

00:00:16,899 --> 00:00:17,994
Welcome to Nessus.

00:00:17,994 --> 00:00:20,996
Half a dozen slot machines,
one blackjack table

00:00:20,996 --> 00:00:23,906
and manure--
lots and lots of manure.

00:00:23,906 --> 00:00:27,944
LANGSTON:
<i>I can't see it,</i>
<i>but I can sure smell it.</i>

00:00:27,944 --> 00:00:30,379
<i>Nick, I'm telling you,</i>
<i>we passed the crime scene.</i>

00:00:30,379 --> 00:00:31,714
No, no, just keep going.

00:00:31,714 --> 00:00:33,950
I've had plenty
of 419s out here.

00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,992
What's up with this GPS?
Whoa!

00:00:37,992 --> 00:00:39,455
Holy cow!

00:00:39,455 --> 00:00:41,991
(moos)

00:00:41,991 --> 00:00:43,994
STOKES:
<i>You know, you kill</i>
<i>one of those in India,</i>

00:00:43,994 --> 00:00:45,991
<i>you spend six months in jail.</i>

00:00:45,991 --> 00:00:47,497
Moo!

00:00:49,991 --> 00:00:52,668
Control, this is Langston.

00:00:52,668 --> 00:00:54,604
(cow moos)

00:00:54,604 --> 00:00:55,805
We're lost.

00:00:55,805 --> 00:01:00,996
(honking horn)

00:01:13,992 --> 00:01:15,987
What took you
guys so long?

00:01:15,987 --> 00:01:16,995
You hit a cow or something?

00:01:16,995 --> 00:01:19,295
Better not.
They're 1,600 bucks apiece.

00:01:19,295 --> 00:01:20,995
And they don't milk
when they're riled.

00:01:22,988 --> 00:01:25,701
(sighs)
Where's the body?

00:01:25,701 --> 00:01:27,637
I'll show you.

00:01:29,772 --> 00:01:31,307
Watch your step there.

00:01:31,307 --> 00:01:32,991
(squishing)

00:01:34,944 --> 00:01:36,679
AKERS: Farmer went camping
at the Virgin River.

00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:37,992
Came back tonight
to feed the cows,

00:01:37,992 --> 00:01:39,989
and saw this.

00:01:39,989 --> 00:01:42,988
Ah, manure with hint
of decomp.

00:01:43,995 --> 00:01:45,993
AKERS:
Well, it's definitely got legs,

00:01:45,993 --> 00:01:47,290
but no hands.

00:01:57,667 --> 00:02:00,336
First generation,
third instar larvae.

00:02:00,336 --> 00:02:03,987
Been dead 96-plus hours.

00:02:03,987 --> 00:02:06,989
White female adult.

00:02:06,989 --> 00:02:09,990
That's not all we have.

00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:12,481
Killers sometimes
remove the head and hands

00:02:12,481 --> 00:02:13,549
to avoid identification.

00:02:13,549 --> 00:02:15,952
Don't usually dump 'em
with the body.

00:02:15,952 --> 00:02:17,954
LANGSTON: I don't think
this is her hand.

00:02:17,954 --> 00:02:18,990
It's too thick.

00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:22,558
The ridges are wide.
Tells me it was a male.

00:02:23,693 --> 00:02:24,995
Yeah, so's this.

00:02:27,995 --> 00:02:30,989
She-body, he-hands.

00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:32,835
We're gonna have to go
through this whole haystack,

00:02:32,835 --> 00:02:34,437
see if we can find
the rest of them.

00:02:34,437 --> 00:02:35,994
It's easier
than looking for needles.

00:02:35,994 --> 00:02:38,991
(phone rings)

00:02:38,991 --> 00:02:40,343
Langston.

00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:43,613
What?!

00:02:43,613 --> 00:02:44,990
Yeah, be right there.

00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,315
Sorry, Nick, gotta go.

00:02:46,315 --> 00:02:48,651
Hey, where you going?!

00:02:48,651 --> 00:02:49,719
We're gonna have to search
this whole farm!

00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:51,420
Think you just
lost your ride.

00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,989
(SVU speeds off)

00:02:53,989 --> 00:02:54,991
I'll handle it.

00:02:56,826 --> 00:02:59,328
HASKELL: I know you're
starting to question

00:02:59,328 --> 00:03:01,297
your commitment
to your job, Ray.

00:03:01,297 --> 00:03:04,400
And I don't think
I'm the only one.

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,988
WILLOWS: Your friend
Haskell surfaced.

00:03:05,988 --> 00:03:07,996
HASKELL: I thought I left you
enough bread crumbs to follow.

00:03:07,996 --> 00:03:10,606
Did I need to make a video, Ray?

00:03:10,606 --> 00:03:13,990
I'm getting tired
of doing all the work

00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,344
in the relationship.

00:03:15,344 --> 00:03:17,813
And, you know,
when I feel unwanted,

00:03:17,813 --> 00:03:20,349
bad things happen.

00:03:20,349 --> 00:03:23,552
Maybe you're just afraid
to catch me.

00:03:23,552 --> 00:03:25,621
Maybe you don't like
looking in the mirror, Ray.

00:03:25,621 --> 00:03:29,392
Maybe you don't like
what you see.

00:03:36,866 --> 00:03:39,989

00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:42,805

Where did you get this?

00:04:09,365 --> 00:04:10,995
Vivian Tinsdale's parents.

00:04:10,995 --> 00:04:12,735
Vivian Tinsdale.

00:04:12,735 --> 00:04:13,990
One of Haskell's brides.

00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:16,872
Yeah.
Yeah. You walked in
at the end of the movie.

00:04:16,872 --> 00:04:18,407
You need to see the opening.

00:04:18,407 --> 00:04:21,677
(sobbing):
Please, Daddy, I'm sorry,

00:04:21,677 --> 00:04:23,995
but you're the only one
who can save me.

00:04:23,995 --> 00:04:25,990
Daddy, he's done things to me!

00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:29,996
And the things he says
he's gonna do...!

00:04:29,996 --> 00:04:31,520
(sobbing)

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,990
Please, Daddy, whatever
he wants, just pay him!

00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:37,993
When did they get this?

00:04:37,993 --> 00:04:38,996
Four days ago.

00:04:38,996 --> 00:04:41,831
She's probably already dead.

00:04:43,989 --> 00:04:45,434
Mr. Tinsdale,

00:04:45,434 --> 00:04:48,337
it took you four days
to come forward

00:04:48,337 --> 00:04:49,405
with this video?

00:04:49,405 --> 00:04:50,773
Who are you?
Ray Langston.

00:04:50,773 --> 00:04:53,476
I've been investigating Nate
Haskell for two years.

00:04:53,476 --> 00:04:54,777
Why didn't you come
forward sooner?

00:04:54,777 --> 00:04:57,580
Well, my computer marked
Vivian's e-mails as spam.

00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,515
I didn't see them
until last night.

00:04:59,515 --> 00:05:00,991
That's still 24 hours ago.

00:05:00,991 --> 00:05:03,819
Officer, we haven't spoken
to Vivian in years.

00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:05,554
She's a stranger to us.

00:05:05,554 --> 00:05:07,623
Now she's asking for our help.

00:05:07,623 --> 00:05:09,392
So you're saying you don't care?

00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:10,393
Listen, my daughter

00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:11,560
is mentally ill.

00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,988
She's a sociopath
and a pathological liar.

00:05:13,988 --> 00:05:16,990
How do you explain
the bruises on her face?
Well, I assume

00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:18,991
they're self-inflicted.
So you're saying
the video's a scam?

00:05:18,991 --> 00:05:20,770
I'm saying that the only time

00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:22,989
we ever hear
from our daughter is

00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,507
when she's asking for money.

00:05:24,507 --> 00:05:25,908
She's not getting another dime.

00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:28,411
You have the video. My husband
and I are going to go.

00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:29,779
Look, that video
and your daughter

00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:32,481
are our only link we have
to an escaped serial killer.

00:05:32,481 --> 00:05:34,750
If you're right and Vivian is
only interested in money,

00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,918
you'll get a call from Haskell.

00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:37,992
When that call comes,
we need to be there.

00:05:37,992 --> 00:05:39,522
We all want the same thing:

00:05:39,522 --> 00:05:41,490
we don't want Nate Haskell
to kill your daughter.

00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:43,987
Or anyone else.

00:05:43,987 --> 00:05:46,629
Now please help us.

00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,443
ROBBINS:
Hey, Nick.
Hey.

00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,995
Please, don't ask me
if I need a hand.

00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:05,848
Actually, I was gonna tell you
you smell like a Porta Potti.

00:06:05,848 --> 00:06:07,995
Thank you, sir.

00:06:07,995 --> 00:06:09,992
ROBBINS:
Obvious sharp-force trauma.

00:06:09,992 --> 00:06:12,655
Crushed and cut carpals.

00:06:12,655 --> 00:06:15,458
Skin on the anterior aspect of
the wrist looks like

00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:18,494
it's been pulled and snapped
from the forearm.

00:06:18,494 --> 00:06:21,797
My guess is the killer got a
little happy with a hand ax.

00:06:22,898 --> 00:06:25,367
So you think this guy was alive

00:06:25,367 --> 00:06:28,370
when his hands waved good-bye
to the rest of his body?

00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,988
Well, no contusions
around the cut.

00:06:30,988 --> 00:06:33,642
Postmortem hack job.

00:06:33,642 --> 00:06:34,743
Go ahead and print.

00:06:34,743 --> 00:06:37,413
No, these fingers
are too dehydrated.

00:06:37,413 --> 00:06:39,715
I'm gonna have to PVS them.

00:06:39,715 --> 00:06:41,717
If you compare his hand
to her wrist,

00:06:41,717 --> 00:06:44,453
there are similar crushing
and cutting injuries

00:06:44,453 --> 00:06:45,990
to the radius and ulna.

00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,989
Same tool, same killer.

00:06:47,989 --> 00:06:50,992
JOHNSON:
Video camera's clock and GPS
were turned off.

00:06:50,992 --> 00:06:52,294
No metadata.

00:06:52,294 --> 00:06:54,987
No way to tell when
or where it was shot.

00:06:54,987 --> 00:06:56,532
Mm, the video was e-mailed
to the Tinsdales.

00:06:56,532 --> 00:06:57,993
You should be able
to trace that.

00:06:57,993 --> 00:06:59,992
Working on it.

00:06:59,992 --> 00:07:04,373
Haskell bounced it around
the Web a half-dozen times.

00:07:06,609 --> 00:07:10,479
JOHNSON:
Well! Deputy Chief Curtis.

00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:11,780
The shield looks good on you.

00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,815
Congrats on the promotion.

00:07:12,815 --> 00:07:14,650
Thanks, Archie.

00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:16,919
You must be Ray Langston.

00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:18,721
Sofia Curtis.

00:07:18,721 --> 00:07:19,990
Nice to meet you.

00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:21,390
Just got the nod

00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:24,493
from the sheriff to head up
the Haskell task force.

00:07:24,493 --> 00:07:26,595
FYI, I'm calling in the feds.

00:07:26,595 --> 00:07:28,397
That might not be the best move.

00:07:28,397 --> 00:07:30,599
We've had sightings of Haskell
from Bangor to San Diego.

00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:33,990
We got reason to believe
he's crossed state lines.

00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:35,437
That makes it federal.

00:07:35,437 --> 00:07:36,805
What about the video?

00:07:36,805 --> 00:07:38,841
The Tinsdales live here
in Vegas.

00:07:38,841 --> 00:07:41,810
Why demand a ransom and then not
stick around to collect it?

00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:44,446
Haskell made no specific demand
for money.

00:07:44,446 --> 00:07:47,349
So, even if it's not about
money, it's about the Tinsdales.

00:07:47,349 --> 00:07:48,996
That connects him to Vegas.

00:07:48,996 --> 00:07:51,520
We both know how this works.

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,422
The lab will still process
the evidence.

00:07:53,422 --> 00:07:54,490
You're not relinquishing
control.

00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:55,724
This video is

00:07:55,724 --> 00:07:57,560
the first solid lead
we've had in months.

00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,995
Unless you got proof that
Haskell's still in state,

00:07:59,995 --> 00:08:01,630
I'm making the call.

00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:03,699
Got it.

00:08:03,699 --> 00:08:05,868
Haskell must be
getting some I.T. support.

00:08:05,868 --> 00:08:07,992
He uploaded the video from

00:08:07,992 --> 00:08:11,640
a open Wi-Fi hot spot
near the Vegas Motor Speedway.

00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,996
I know him.
I knew I was right.

00:08:13,996 --> 00:08:15,711
You got lucky today.

00:08:15,711 --> 00:08:16,994
Police officers
at the Tinsdale house

00:08:16,994 --> 00:08:18,994
just intercepted a call
from Haskell.

00:08:18,994 --> 00:08:21,350
I got him on the line now.
Run a trace.

00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,484
WOMAN:
Yes, sir, running it now.

00:08:22,484 --> 00:08:25,354
HASKELL:
Avery, pencils ready?

00:08:25,354 --> 00:08:26,622
AVERY:
Just give me a second.

00:08:26,622 --> 00:08:27,823
HASKELL:
Now, you really should be
better prepared

00:08:27,823 --> 00:08:29,525
for this kind of thing, Avery.

00:08:29,525 --> 00:08:30,992
I hope you're not stalling

00:08:30,992 --> 00:08:33,362
so my good friend Ray Langston
can trace this.

00:08:33,362 --> 00:08:34,930
Maybe I should hang up
right now.

00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:36,599
No, don't. I'm here.

00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,994
HASKELL: Provenzi Park,
5:30, bench by the playground.

00:08:39,994 --> 00:08:42,638
No cops. You hear that, Ray?

00:08:42,638 --> 00:08:44,994
(click, dial tone)

00:08:44,994 --> 00:08:46,308
"No user information."

00:08:46,308 --> 00:08:47,576
Disposable phone.

00:08:47,576 --> 00:08:48,992
He's probably disposed of it
already.

00:08:48,992 --> 00:08:51,547
Shout-out from Haskell.

00:08:51,547 --> 00:08:52,996
The man does like
sticking it to you.

00:08:52,996 --> 00:08:55,351
All right, 5:30.
That gives us two hours.

00:08:55,351 --> 00:08:58,621
STOKES:
Hey.

00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,322
Well, thank you
for showering.

00:09:00,322 --> 00:09:04,293
Well, I didn't necessarily do it
for you, but you're welcome.

00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:05,761
Got a C.O.D. yet?

00:09:05,761 --> 00:09:07,996
No. I don't even
have a head.

00:09:07,996 --> 00:09:10,599
Torso's fairly fit, rules out
most natural causes.

00:09:10,599 --> 00:09:13,736
Can anything else help
us get an I.D. on her?

00:09:13,736 --> 00:09:14,989
Appendectomy scar.

00:09:14,989 --> 00:09:17,339
Cervix shows no prior
pregnancies,

00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:19,908
no tattoos,
no implants,

00:09:19,908 --> 00:09:22,778
but small scar on the abdomen
could be from liposuction.

00:09:22,778 --> 00:09:25,987
Left femur has
an old radial fracture.

00:09:25,987 --> 00:09:27,383
Slight calcification.

00:09:27,383 --> 00:09:29,518
Age: early to mid-30s.

00:09:29,518 --> 00:09:33,355
Woman in her 30's, appendectomy,
lipo and a busted leg.

00:09:33,355 --> 00:09:34,857
All you need now is a name.

00:09:34,857 --> 00:09:35,987
(phone rings)

00:09:35,987 --> 00:09:37,989
I just got a hit off
one of the hands.

00:09:37,989 --> 00:09:40,990
Came back to a Graham Kole.

00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:43,465
Greg DMV'd him, got an address.
It's a doctor's office.

00:09:56,378 --> 00:10:00,549
Plastic surgeon
with his hands cut off, huh?

00:10:00,549 --> 00:10:03,619
Maybe he messed up some psycho
hooker's boob job.

00:10:03,619 --> 00:10:06,922
Yeah, what kind of a surgeon
works out of a strip mall

00:10:06,922 --> 00:10:07,992
next to a taco joint?

00:10:10,826 --> 00:10:12,994
(groans)

00:10:12,994 --> 00:10:14,989
Well, we got a warrant.

00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:16,565
We do, don't we?
Mm-hmm.

00:10:24,673 --> 00:10:26,675
(glass crunching underfoot)

00:10:28,777 --> 00:10:31,680
SANDERS:
There's the head, neck, arms
and rest of Dr. Kole.

00:10:42,991 --> 00:10:46,328
STOKES:
Two blood pools...

00:10:46,328 --> 00:10:48,330
two victims.

00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:50,532
Good chance this is our primary.

00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,945
JOHNSON:
Mr. Tinsdale.

00:11:02,945 --> 00:11:05,481
Mr. Tinsdale, if you can
hear me, please cough.

00:11:05,481 --> 00:11:06,582
(coughs)

00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:07,716
Okay, we're good.

00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,992
(phone rings)

00:11:29,991 --> 00:11:31,990
I don't think
it's his cell phone.

00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:33,742
Tell him to answer it.

00:11:33,742 --> 00:11:36,645
Mr. Tinsdale, please find that
phone and answer it.

00:11:36,645 --> 00:11:38,914
Hold it up to your right ear
so I can record

00:11:38,914 --> 00:11:41,383
the caller's voice in
your earpiece.

00:11:41,383 --> 00:11:42,851
Hello?

00:11:42,851 --> 00:11:44,996
The other ear. The right ear.
Tell him the right ear.

00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:46,455
LANGSTON:
What's he doing?

00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:47,823
Mr. Tinsdale,
switch sides, please.

00:11:47,823 --> 00:11:48,924
Your other ear.

00:11:48,924 --> 00:11:50,592
Wait a minute.
You're breaking up.

00:11:51,393 --> 00:11:53,994
Yeah, there, I can hear you.

00:11:53,994 --> 00:11:55,397
Too bad we can't.

00:11:55,397 --> 00:11:57,733
That wasn't the deal.

00:11:57,733 --> 00:11:59,995
I did what you asked.

00:11:59,995 --> 00:12:02,638
Where's Vivian?
I want to talk to her right now.

00:12:05,996 --> 00:12:08,677
Yes, I see it.

00:12:08,677 --> 00:12:10,312
It's the pink one?

00:12:20,355 --> 00:12:23,692
Yes, I have it.

00:12:23,692 --> 00:12:26,862
All right, I understand.

00:12:31,366 --> 00:12:32,992
BRASS: Well, happy big
birthday, baby.

00:12:32,992 --> 00:12:34,992
He better hope
that's not a bomb.

00:12:34,992 --> 00:12:37,991
LANGSTON:
He's being directed.

00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:39,989
LANGSTON:
Scan the park.

00:12:39,989 --> 00:12:42,377
Turn to the woman
by the playground.

00:12:42,377 --> 00:12:44,913
I thinks she's got
eyes on Tinsdale.

00:12:44,913 --> 00:12:47,382
Archie, give me a better look.

00:12:47,382 --> 00:12:48,989
Damn! That's Tina Vincent!

00:12:48,989 --> 00:12:50,419
It's a bride!

00:12:54,995 --> 00:12:56,658
OFFICER (over radio):
She spotted us.

00:12:56,658 --> 00:12:58,990
Suspect now on foot,
running southbound.

00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:02,497
OFFICER:
LVPD! Down on the ground! Now!

00:13:02,497 --> 00:13:03,532
BOY:
Whoa! She's gone!

00:13:04,989 --> 00:13:06,994
Out of the way!
(shrieking)

00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:08,995
Where is he?!
(chuckles)

00:13:08,995 --> 00:13:11,640
Where's Nate?

00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,987
(laughs)

00:13:12,987 --> 00:13:13,996
Where is he?!

00:13:13,996 --> 00:13:15,777
Ray! Hey, Ray!

00:13:15,777 --> 00:13:16,945
Where is he?!

00:13:16,945 --> 00:13:18,747
(laughing)

00:13:29,405 --> 00:13:32,777
WILLOWS:
What were you doing in
the park, Tina?

00:13:32,777 --> 00:13:35,212
TINA:
What do people do in parks?

00:13:35,212 --> 00:13:37,081
Walk dogs.

00:13:37,081 --> 00:13:39,406
Walk themselves.

00:13:39,406 --> 00:13:42,286
I find it very...

00:13:42,286 --> 00:13:43,287
soothing.

00:13:43,287 --> 00:13:44,855
I find it very
coincidental

00:13:44,855 --> 00:13:46,857
given your relationship
with Nate Haskell.

00:13:46,857 --> 00:13:48,404
Relationship? No.

00:13:48,404 --> 00:13:50,411
I admire him.

00:13:50,411 --> 00:13:54,404
I admire his courage because
he's clearly a victim

00:13:54,404 --> 00:13:56,200
of the justice system

00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,804
that is bent on persecuting him
for crimes he could not commit.

00:13:59,804 --> 00:14:02,907
You were present at his
recent trial along with

00:14:02,907 --> 00:14:04,742
Vivian Tinsdale-- what's your
relationship with her?

00:14:04,742 --> 00:14:06,177
She disgusts me.

00:14:06,177 --> 00:14:09,407
And I think she's a bad
influence on Nate.

00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:11,409
It sounds like you've seen
Vivian and Nate recently.

00:14:11,409 --> 00:14:13,405
LAWYER:
My client didn't say that.

00:14:13,405 --> 00:14:14,405
Don't put words in her mouth.

00:14:14,405 --> 00:14:16,053
I couldn't if I tried.

00:14:16,053 --> 00:14:17,407
Where is Nate Haskell now?

00:14:17,407 --> 00:14:19,090
Where's Vivian?
Are you aware that she's

00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:21,403
been kidnapped?
My client's told you
what she knows.

00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:26,130
Last I checked, a walk
in the park is not a crime.

00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:28,332
But a cop beating up on an
innocent civilian is.

00:14:28,332 --> 00:14:30,134
I'll be in touch.

00:14:37,074 --> 00:14:40,077
Oh, your prisons

00:14:40,077 --> 00:14:41,410
couldn't hold Nate.

00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:44,048
He willed himself to be free.

00:14:44,048 --> 00:14:47,405
Tell Ray Langston
he'll never catch him...

00:14:47,405 --> 00:14:50,407
not until Nate wills it.

00:15:11,308 --> 00:15:15,112
Where is Hodges?

00:15:15,112 --> 00:15:17,948
Uh, he's moving out of his
mother's place... finally.

00:15:17,948 --> 00:15:19,411
I'm not sure who's more
traumatized.

00:15:19,411 --> 00:15:22,153
Is, uh, is that
the package from the park?

00:15:22,153 --> 00:15:23,412
I heard Haskell.

00:15:23,412 --> 00:15:25,990
left you a present.
It's evidence.

00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:27,324
I assume it's been X-rayed?

00:15:27,324 --> 00:15:28,959
Yes, the Bomb Squad
scanned it.

00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,405
I just checked it for trace.

00:15:31,405 --> 00:15:33,063
I need to print it.

00:15:33,063 --> 00:15:34,064
Where's Mandy?

00:15:34,064 --> 00:15:36,200
Uh, Denver.
Conference.

00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,002
You're in luck.
I've worked in

00:15:38,002 --> 00:15:39,837
every forensic
discipline except QD.

00:15:39,837 --> 00:15:41,806
Too many paper cuts.

00:15:41,806 --> 00:15:42,807
Let me help you.

00:15:42,807 --> 00:15:45,142
You do the box,
I'll do the tape.

00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:20,845
Ray, the size says
probably male.

00:16:20,845 --> 00:16:22,213
He left it dead center.

00:16:22,213 --> 00:16:24,248
Exquisite ridge detail.

00:16:24,248 --> 00:16:25,749
Sloppy, sloppy.

00:16:25,749 --> 00:16:27,818
Not sloppy. Intentional.

00:16:27,818 --> 00:16:29,409
It's Haskell's way
of signing the package.

00:16:29,409 --> 00:16:30,409
Run it anyway.

00:16:46,408 --> 00:16:48,305
LANGSTON:
Do you recognize this man?

00:16:48,305 --> 00:16:50,007
Yeah, I sure
as hell do.

00:16:50,007 --> 00:16:51,275
Where'd you get that?

00:16:51,275 --> 00:16:52,407
Who is he?

00:16:52,407 --> 00:16:54,011
That's Jack.

00:16:54,011 --> 00:16:55,410
That's Jack York.

00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:56,714
It was Vivian's
first husband.

00:16:56,714 --> 00:16:58,405
This was in the box you gave me.

00:16:58,405 --> 00:17:00,403
You have any idea
why Nate Haskell wanted you

00:17:00,403 --> 00:17:01,409
to give me this photograph?

00:17:01,409 --> 00:17:02,820
No, I don't.

00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,409
BRASS:
Tell us about Jack York.

00:17:04,409 --> 00:17:07,825
Well, he was just one
in a long line of men

00:17:07,825 --> 00:17:09,860
that took advantage of Vivian.

00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,996
Except this one she married.

00:17:11,996 --> 00:17:13,403
Only lasted a few months.

00:17:13,403 --> 00:17:14,405
BRASS:
Where is he?

00:17:14,405 --> 00:17:15,411
We'd like to
talk to him.

00:17:15,411 --> 00:17:16,767
Well, I can't help you.
He took off.

00:17:16,767 --> 00:17:19,036
I mean, Jack was bad news.

00:17:19,036 --> 00:17:20,237
He didn't love Vivian,
only her money.

00:17:20,237 --> 00:17:21,409
That day in the park,

00:17:21,409 --> 00:17:23,841
what did you and
Haskell talk about?

00:17:23,841 --> 00:17:26,406
Well, I could only hear about
half of what he was saying.

00:17:26,406 --> 00:17:28,712
"That wasn't the deal!

00:17:28,712 --> 00:17:30,411
I did what you asked.
Where's Vivian?"

00:17:30,411 --> 00:17:32,407
Sounds like you two had
a conversation.

00:17:32,407 --> 00:17:34,412
He was yelling at me,
making demands.

00:17:34,412 --> 00:17:36,320
Most of it was about you.

00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,988
BRASS:
"That wasn't the deal."

00:17:37,988 --> 00:17:40,291
That sounds like it was
about you, pal.

00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:42,404
I told you what I know.

00:17:42,404 --> 00:17:44,094
He made no demands for ransom?

00:17:44,094 --> 00:17:45,329
He gave you no instructions?

00:17:46,407 --> 00:17:48,406
We have a warrant
for your computer,

00:17:48,406 --> 00:17:51,001
bank records, cell phone
and credit cards.

00:17:51,001 --> 00:17:53,405
We're going to take
a very long look

00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,404
at everything in your life.

00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:05,316
This blood's dry and flaky.

00:18:05,316 --> 00:18:07,404
It's days old.

00:18:07,404 --> 00:18:10,408
Matches the time line of the
maggots I found on the bodies.

00:18:10,408 --> 00:18:13,857
No bone chips,
no bone fragments.

00:18:13,857 --> 00:18:16,160
Not enough blood to
suggest dismemberment.

00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,195
They might have
been killed here,

00:18:18,195 --> 00:18:20,831
but they were probably
cut up somewhere else.

00:18:26,406 --> 00:18:28,406
(camera shutter clicking)

00:18:30,808 --> 00:18:32,710
Small blood trace.

00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:34,878
Looks like
he just stripped these off.

00:18:34,878 --> 00:18:38,411
You know, I think Dr. Kole
might have been seeing a patient

00:18:38,411 --> 00:18:41,018
right before he became
one of these blood pools.

00:18:45,222 --> 00:18:47,925
Got a chart.

00:18:47,925 --> 00:18:50,407
Medical sticker's
been ripped off.

00:18:50,407 --> 00:18:52,412
It's empty.

00:18:52,412 --> 00:18:55,032
Maybe the patient had something
to do with this.

00:18:55,032 --> 00:18:59,404
Okay, so, the patient kills
the doctor and the nurse?

00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:01,408
If the doctor was
working on someone

00:19:01,408 --> 00:19:03,273
with the nurse
by his side,

00:19:03,273 --> 00:19:05,275
this second blood pool's
probably hers.

00:19:05,275 --> 00:19:10,406
And the spider trajectory
points back

00:19:10,406 --> 00:19:13,117
to the doorway,
and not to the patient.

00:19:13,117 --> 00:19:14,752
Maybe the shooter.

00:19:14,752 --> 00:19:15,953
A little groggy, huh?

00:19:15,953 --> 00:19:17,221
You're looking good.

00:19:17,221 --> 00:19:18,408
Hey, what are
you doing here?

00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:20,412
(cartridge casings clatter)

00:19:28,065 --> 00:19:30,409
Bullet--
looks like a nine mill.

00:19:30,409 --> 00:19:32,770
Hmm. I don't see
any cartridge casings.

00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:34,406
Well, one of the victims
was definitely shot.

00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:35,411
There's tissue on the bullet.

00:19:35,411 --> 00:19:37,808
Through and through.

00:19:37,808 --> 00:19:39,910
We need to get this back
to the lab,

00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:42,946
see if the tissue on the bullet
matches the hands or the torso.

00:19:42,946 --> 00:19:44,948
♪ ♪

00:20:15,946 --> 00:20:19,216
♪ ♪

00:20:40,104 --> 00:20:45,709
Uh, Ms. Kole?

00:20:45,709 --> 00:20:47,811
Hi. I'm CSI Stokes.

00:20:47,811 --> 00:20:50,409
I'm very sorry
for your loss.

00:20:50,409 --> 00:20:53,317
Boy, is my life starting
to look up.

00:20:53,317 --> 00:20:54,406
(laughs)
(giggles)

00:20:54,406 --> 00:20:56,053
I need to get
your fingerprints.

00:20:56,053 --> 00:20:59,405
If you can get past these,
be my guest.

00:20:59,405 --> 00:21:00,858
We'll see what
we can do.

00:21:00,858 --> 00:21:02,760
Why don't you have
a seat for me?

00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,403
By the way,

00:21:04,403 --> 00:21:07,411
I didn't kill
my crappy husband.

00:21:07,411 --> 00:21:09,408
Well, if you didn't kill
your crappy husband,

00:21:09,408 --> 00:21:11,001
who do you think did?

00:21:11,001 --> 00:21:14,872
Did you know that Vegas is the
fugitive capital of the world?

00:21:14,872 --> 00:21:16,106
I didn't know that.
Yeah.

00:21:16,106 --> 00:21:17,412
Right hand, please.

00:21:17,412 --> 00:21:20,077
And, uh, Graham
did a few, um,

00:21:20,077 --> 00:21:23,080
faces, if you know
what I mean.

00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,915
I get it.
Do you?

00:21:24,915 --> 00:21:26,406
Yeah. Please.

00:21:26,406 --> 00:21:29,411
So, when was the last time
that you saw Graham?

00:21:29,411 --> 00:21:31,403
When he told me
to turn my vibrator down.

00:21:31,403 --> 00:21:33,957
He didn't speak
to me for weeks.

00:21:33,957 --> 00:21:36,407
It was a Monday, so it must have
been about five days ago.

00:21:36,407 --> 00:21:37,795
And when he didn't come home,

00:21:37,795 --> 00:21:39,407
how come you just didn't
call the police?

00:21:39,407 --> 00:21:41,031
Because I knew where he was.

00:21:41,031 --> 00:21:43,167
He was either at the Wynn
or the Encore.

00:21:43,167 --> 00:21:45,235
Hmm. And why would
he stay at a hotel

00:21:45,235 --> 00:21:47,004
if he's got a house
here in town?

00:21:47,004 --> 00:21:48,410
Because he doesn't
have a vibrator.

00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:50,874
And he would be
bringing home the real thing.

00:21:50,874 --> 00:21:53,277
And then I would be up
all night long

00:21:53,277 --> 00:21:56,980
listening to nothing but,
"Oh! Oh, God.

00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:59,349
"Oh, Graham,
you're the best.

00:21:59,349 --> 00:22:01,351
"Oh, gosh, there's nobody

00:22:01,351 --> 00:22:03,153
like you."

00:22:03,153 --> 00:22:06,089
Guys like fake.

00:22:06,089 --> 00:22:07,357
Some guys do.

00:22:07,357 --> 00:22:09,409
Oh, okay.
And do you have

00:22:09,409 --> 00:22:12,062
any idea who this affair
might have been with?

00:22:12,062 --> 00:22:13,408
Nursey Newtox.

00:22:13,408 --> 00:22:15,408
You know what you need to do?

00:22:15,408 --> 00:22:17,968
Tell me.
You need to put up

00:22:17,968 --> 00:22:20,408
"Wanted" posters of a girl
who looks just like me--

00:22:20,408 --> 00:22:22,005
minus 20 years--

00:22:22,005 --> 00:22:25,242
with a touch of silicon,
a dash of collagen, rhino,

00:22:25,242 --> 00:22:27,408
Botox and lipo,

00:22:27,408 --> 00:22:29,980
and the perkiest
double-D's you've seen

00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,115
this side of the Hoover Dam.

00:22:32,115 --> 00:22:34,117
And this nurse,
does she have a name?

00:22:34,117 --> 00:22:35,853
Teagan.
Teagan.

00:22:35,853 --> 00:22:36,954
Teagan Murphy.

00:22:36,954 --> 00:22:38,856
I mean, who has a name

00:22:38,856 --> 00:22:40,123
like Teagan?
Mm.

00:22:40,123 --> 00:22:42,860
Right? Give me a break.

00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,411
(low whirring)

00:22:45,412 --> 00:22:47,405
(beeping)

00:22:47,405 --> 00:22:50,734
STOKES:
I got a name on Kole's nurse.

00:22:50,734 --> 00:22:52,236
I ran her
through the DMV.

00:22:52,236 --> 00:22:53,770
I'm heading over
there right now.

00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:57,207
Should be able to pull
some exemplars for DNA.

00:22:57,207 --> 00:22:58,342
You all right, bud?

00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:03,080
The bullet that we found
at Kole's office

00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:06,950
is a match to the gun used
during Haskell's escape.

00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:08,352
Whoa, wait a minute.

00:23:08,352 --> 00:23:10,087
Now, that gun was fired

00:23:10,087 --> 00:23:11,404
by one of Haskell's brides.

00:23:11,404 --> 00:23:13,410
SANDERS: And if the gun
was at Kole's office,

00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:15,792
one of the brides was there.

00:23:15,792 --> 00:23:19,409
And the brides go...
where Haskell goes.

00:23:19,409 --> 00:23:22,032
If Haskell was at that office,

00:23:22,032 --> 00:23:24,935
do you think there's a chance
he had some plastic surgery,

00:23:24,935 --> 00:23:26,370
changed his face?

00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:28,403
And killed the doctor
and his nurse

00:23:28,403 --> 00:23:30,040
to cover his tracks.

00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,412
If we're right
about this,

00:23:31,412 --> 00:23:34,811
Haskell could be just
another face in the crowd.

00:23:34,811 --> 00:23:36,713
Which means we don't know
who we're looking for anymore.

00:23:41,405 --> 00:23:42,411
WILLOWS:
<i>Here's what we have:</i>

00:23:42,411 --> 00:23:43,887
Haskell's out there,

00:23:43,887 --> 00:23:45,789
and he may have a new face.

00:23:45,789 --> 00:23:47,404
Well, the new face
is a game changer.

00:23:47,404 --> 00:23:48,406
I'm sick of
this guy.

00:23:48,406 --> 00:23:50,827
He's like the Joker in<i>Batman.</i>

00:23:50,827 --> 00:23:52,296
Except without the laughs.

00:23:52,296 --> 00:23:54,364
We have no hard evidence

00:23:54,364 --> 00:23:56,767
that puts Haskell
at the plastic surgeon's.

00:23:56,767 --> 00:23:58,411
That may be wishful thinking.

00:23:58,411 --> 00:24:02,272
Ballistics only puts a gun,
used by one of Haskell's brides,

00:24:02,272 --> 00:24:03,408
at the scene.

00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:06,109
After the trial,
I saw all of Haskell's brides,

00:24:06,109 --> 00:24:08,178
including Tina,
in the parking lot.

00:24:08,178 --> 00:24:10,411
The only ones that weren't there
were Robin and Vivian.

00:24:10,411 --> 00:24:12,916
Well, we know it wasn't Robin
that talked to Kole,

00:24:12,916 --> 00:24:14,411
because she was popped
during the escape.

00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:18,021
Most likely by Vivian after
she shot the four prison guards.

00:24:18,021 --> 00:24:20,409
If Vivian is Bonnie
to Haskell's Clyde,

00:24:20,409 --> 00:24:23,827
why is Haskell
holding her for ransom?

00:24:25,403 --> 00:24:27,097
He's not.

00:24:27,097 --> 00:24:29,266
The timeline's wrong.

00:24:29,266 --> 00:24:30,934
While Daddy's getting a video
of his little girl

00:24:30,934 --> 00:24:32,169
begging for her life,

00:24:32,169 --> 00:24:35,412
Vivian is off killing
the doctor and the nurse.

00:24:35,412 --> 00:24:37,941
So Haskell and Vivian
are working together.

00:24:37,941 --> 00:24:39,409
There was no kidnapping.

00:24:39,409 --> 00:24:43,246
So why the dog-and-pony show
at the park?

00:24:43,246 --> 00:24:45,882
I don't know, but it must have
something to do with Haskell

00:24:45,882 --> 00:24:47,851
sending me this photograph
of Vivian's ex.

00:24:47,851 --> 00:24:49,720
Well, Tinsdale knows,
but he's not talking.

00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,721
(phone rings)

00:24:50,721 --> 00:24:52,408
Hey, Archie.

00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:54,404
Be right there.

00:24:54,404 --> 00:24:56,860
We may not need Tinsdale.

00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,407
What have you
got, Archie?

00:24:58,407 --> 00:25:01,031
Yeah, well, Tinsdale
didn't help us out at the park,

00:25:01,031 --> 00:25:03,100
but his computer
is helping us out plenty.

00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,409
That video file he brought in

00:25:04,409 --> 00:25:06,410
wasn't the first message
he got from Haskell.

00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:08,238
You got to be kidding me.
Nope.

00:25:08,238 --> 00:25:10,073
I pulled this off
of deep memory.

00:25:10,073 --> 00:25:11,406
Must've thought he deleted it.

00:25:11,406 --> 00:25:12,809
When did this
video file come in?

00:25:12,809 --> 00:25:14,405
One week before the
one he showed us.

00:25:14,405 --> 00:25:15,912
Put it up, put it up,
put it up.

00:25:15,912 --> 00:25:18,982
I'm sorry I can't get
a better image quality here.

00:25:18,982 --> 00:25:20,409
HASKELL:
You have been so generous

00:25:20,409 --> 00:25:22,986
with me already, Avery,
giving me your daughter.

00:25:22,986 --> 00:25:25,989
She is such a fragile flower.

00:25:25,989 --> 00:25:28,091
And we both know why.

00:25:28,091 --> 00:25:29,826
She's told me some secrets.

00:25:29,826 --> 00:25:32,406
Very naughty, Avery.

00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:34,411
Yet the more I hear about you,
the more I like you.

00:25:34,411 --> 00:25:36,166
You're my kind of guy.

00:25:36,166 --> 00:25:39,405
But not everyone is
as open-minded as I am, Avery,

00:25:39,405 --> 00:25:41,238
so you're gonna have
to open your wallet.

00:25:41,238 --> 00:25:44,207
It's so tawdry
to talk about amounts,

00:25:44,207 --> 00:25:46,406
but how about $2 million?

00:25:46,406 --> 00:25:47,406
JOHNSON:
That's it.

00:25:47,406 --> 00:25:49,405
Now we know
why Haskell

00:25:49,405 --> 00:25:51,403
made no ransom demand
and why Tinsdale

00:25:51,403 --> 00:25:53,717
showed no real interest in
getting his daughter back.

00:25:53,717 --> 00:25:55,410
This is all about blackmail.

00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:57,954
Haskell had
already been paid.

00:25:57,954 --> 00:26:00,290
Secrets between
father and daughter.

00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:03,160
Clearly, Vivian's
bad taste in men started early.

00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,328
If Tinsdale wanted to hide
his dirty little secret,

00:26:05,328 --> 00:26:06,408
why would he come forward?

00:26:06,408 --> 00:26:08,899
Because Haskell
forced him to.

00:26:08,899 --> 00:26:11,068
I pulled
Tinsdale's bank records.

00:26:11,068 --> 00:26:14,838
He withdrew $2 million,
in cash, five days ago.

00:26:14,838 --> 00:26:16,404
Told the bank manager

00:26:16,404 --> 00:26:18,842
it was for some
offshore investment deal.

00:26:18,842 --> 00:26:20,411
(scoffs)
He lied to us.

00:26:20,411 --> 00:26:22,946
He just bought Haskell
$2 million worth of freedom,

00:26:22,946 --> 00:26:24,214
the son of a bitch.

00:26:24,214 --> 00:26:26,407
I know where you're going, Ray.
Don't try

00:26:26,407 --> 00:26:28,409
to stop me, Catherine!
Okay, then go ahead.

00:26:28,409 --> 00:26:31,254
You'll be doing exactly
what Haskell wants you to do.

00:26:31,254 --> 00:26:34,057
Haskell sent you
Jack York's photo for a reason.

00:26:35,258 --> 00:26:37,260
York disappeared

00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,763
right after he married Vivian.

00:26:41,412 --> 00:26:43,934
He came between
father and daughter.

00:26:43,934 --> 00:26:45,936
Maybe Tinsdale killed him.

00:26:45,936 --> 00:26:48,271
Vivian knew about it.

00:26:48,271 --> 00:26:49,339
She told Haskell.

00:26:49,339 --> 00:26:50,774
This is a game.

00:26:50,774 --> 00:26:53,409
This is a dance
between you and Haskell.

00:26:53,409 --> 00:26:55,912
Haskell isn't talking
to Tinsdale on the video.

00:26:55,912 --> 00:26:57,147
He's talking to<i>you.</i>

00:26:57,147 --> 00:26:58,406
Catch me if you can.

00:26:58,406 --> 00:27:00,406
Well, he wants to play...

00:27:00,406 --> 00:27:02,953
Ray.

00:27:07,991 --> 00:27:09,826
(sighs)

00:27:09,826 --> 00:27:12,362
What do you want
me to do, boss?

00:27:12,362 --> 00:27:14,407
You don't do this alone.

00:27:14,407 --> 00:27:17,407
We go after Haskell together.

00:27:17,407 --> 00:27:19,407
(siren whoops)

00:27:27,407 --> 00:27:29,713
(doorbell rings twice)

00:27:34,751 --> 00:27:37,254
Mrs. Tinsdale,
are you all right?

00:27:37,254 --> 00:27:39,756
What happened?

00:27:39,756 --> 00:27:42,408
My husband's in the study.

00:27:56,306 --> 00:27:57,841
He's dead.

00:27:57,841 --> 00:27:59,809
BRASS:
.38 special.

00:27:59,809 --> 00:28:00,744
So, you think it's suicide

00:28:00,744 --> 00:28:02,979
or an assist
from the wife?

00:28:02,979 --> 00:28:04,047
I'm checking both
both for GSR.

00:28:04,047 --> 00:28:05,215
Contact wound.

00:28:05,215 --> 00:28:07,409
Single exit to the
back of the head.

00:28:07,409 --> 00:28:12,022
The pattern on the wall is
consistent with an upward angle.

(gunshot)

00:28:15,292 --> 00:28:16,960
Bullet exited the head

00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,410
and entered the wall.

00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:20,130
The blood
on Mrs. Tinsdale

00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:22,408
is probably transfer
from embracing him.

00:28:22,408 --> 00:28:23,900
Well, why kill himself now?

00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:26,803
He already paid Haskell
$2 million for his silence.

00:28:26,803 --> 00:28:28,038
Take a look around.

00:28:28,038 --> 00:28:29,306
Maybe Haskell
wanted more money.

00:28:29,306 --> 00:28:31,341
Didn't we take
his computer, Jim?

00:28:31,341 --> 00:28:33,276

Financial security

But, Avery, the...
the home movies that Vivian

00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:50,405

fan of the police or the church,

00:28:57,934 --> 00:29:00,237
but what you did was a sin.

00:29:00,237 --> 00:29:03,106
So I do have to file-share it
with my friends in uniform.

00:29:03,106 --> 00:29:04,140

It wasn't his fault.

He didn't want it.

Excuse me?

00:29:24,728 --> 00:29:27,197
She came to him.

00:29:28,231 --> 00:29:30,800
Vivian... was a child.

00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,403
You were her mother.

00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:34,337
It was your job to protect her.

00:29:34,337 --> 00:29:37,207
Do you think it's strange
that I gave birth

00:29:37,207 --> 00:29:39,407

The blood was definitely male,

00:36:27,183 --> 00:36:30,753
Which makes him
Dr. Kole's last patient.

00:36:46,936 --> 00:36:48,905

00:36:59,148 --> 00:37:01,050

whose empty chart did we find?

00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:12,361
Haskell's.

00:37:12,361 --> 00:37:13,863
He killed the doctor
and the nurse

00:37:13,863 --> 00:37:16,407
and probably took his records
to cover his tracks.

00:37:16,407 --> 00:37:17,411
Well, I'll print Frost's chart

00:37:17,411 --> 00:37:19,202

back into the cabinet.

00:37:19,202 --> 00:37:20,407
Well, if we find

00:37:20,407 --> 00:37:22,739
Haskell's fingerprints,
that means he was still in Vegas

00:37:22,739 --> 00:37:24,406

Well, I got two lefts

00:37:36,152 --> 00:37:38,254
Now, Dr. Robbins used tool marks

00:37:38,254 --> 00:37:39,989
to determine
which hands were Vivian's.

00:37:39,989 --> 00:37:41,410
I used nail polish.

00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:44,405
Vivian is wearing Fuchsia Flare.

00:37:48,405 --> 00:37:49,966
Positive for lead.

00:37:51,868 --> 00:37:54,070

Dr. Kole took a nine-
mil in the chest.

00:38:06,406 --> 00:38:08,407
Nurse had a nine-mil
perforate her head.

00:38:08,407 --> 00:38:11,220
There's your

What about Calvin Frost here?

00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,408
Like Vivian Tinsdale,
he was shot

00:38:12,408 --> 00:38:14,403
in the head.
T.O.D.?

00:38:14,403 --> 00:38:16,893
All four victims were killed
within hours of each other,

00:38:16,893 --> 00:38:18,294
four to five
days ago.

00:38:18,294 --> 00:38:19,829
You didn't feel
a thing, did you?

00:38:19,829 --> 00:38:20,830
Thank God.

00:38:22,031 --> 00:38:24,767
Hey, what are you doing?
Aah!

LANGSTON:
<i>So, the evidence says</i>
<i>that Vivian was our shooter,</i>

was killed at the office.

00:38:32,208 --> 00:38:34,143
If they're going
to kill him anyway,

00:38:34,143 --> 00:38:35,411
why not shoot him there?

00:38:35,411 --> 00:38:36,411
Maybe Haskell and Vivian
needed someone

00:38:36,411 --> 00:38:38,247
to help them carry the bodies.

00:38:38,247 --> 00:38:41,217
So they drove out to
the house, shot Frost,

00:38:41,217 --> 00:38:43,406
and then commenced
to choppin'?

00:38:43,406 --> 00:38:46,756
Then someone used
the same gun to shoot Vivian

00:38:46,756 --> 00:38:48,224
and then began
chopping her up.

00:38:48,224 --> 00:38:49,403
Haskell?

00:38:49,403 --> 00:38:52,408
Chopping up bodies and
leaving the job unfinished?

00:38:52,408 --> 00:38:53,996
Leaving parts
in a haystack

00:38:53,996 --> 00:38:55,411
and then the rest
in a bathtub?

00:38:55,411 --> 00:38:58,301
Whatever Haskell is,
he's not disorganized.

00:38:58,301 --> 00:38:59,404
That's not his M.O.

00:38:59,404 --> 00:39:01,971
Hmm.

00:39:01,971 --> 00:39:04,707
Tina...<i>Tina.</i>

00:39:04,707 --> 00:39:07,143
She was his connection
to the farm,

00:39:07,143 --> 00:39:08,409
she was his eyes
at the park.

00:39:08,409 --> 00:39:10,409
She's his new number one.

00:39:36,772 --> 00:39:38,741
JOHNSON:
Hey, Catherine.

00:39:38,741 --> 00:39:39,775
I traced the
serial numbers

00:39:39,775 --> 00:39:41,411
from the electronics
at the farmhouse.

00:39:41,411 --> 00:39:43,145
All purchased
by Tina Vincent,

00:39:43,145 --> 00:39:45,214
and here's the kicker--
I pulled the metadata

00:39:45,214 --> 00:39:47,750
off her video
camera's SD card.

00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:49,886
All those videos Haskell
sent to Tinsdale--

00:39:49,886 --> 00:39:51,120
all recorded
on the same day

00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,922
eight weeks ago,

00:39:52,922 --> 00:39:55,405
specifically on the day
after Haskell escaped.

00:39:55,405 --> 00:39:58,261
He's been playing us
this whole time.

00:39:58,261 --> 00:39:59,408
WILLOWS:
I printed Frost's chart.

00:39:59,408 --> 00:40:00,997
Tina Vincent was
all over it,

00:40:00,997 --> 00:40:03,332
yet we didn't find
a single Haskell print

00:40:03,332 --> 00:40:04,967
in that entire office.

00:40:04,967 --> 00:40:07,405
Doesn't mean he wasn't there,
just not lately.

00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:10,411
Well, we do know that both Tina
and Vivian were at the scene.

00:40:10,411 --> 00:40:13,809
Vivian's dead
and Tina Vincent's in the wind.

00:40:13,809 --> 00:40:16,409
LANGSTON:
We won't find her or
Haskell, not looking here.

00:40:16,409 --> 00:40:19,148
They're not in Vegas.

00:40:19,148 --> 00:40:21,918
The video,
the ransom demand, the park,

00:40:21,918 --> 00:40:24,403
the murders at Dr. Kole's--

00:40:24,403 --> 00:40:25,755
they were all intended
to make us think

00:40:25,755 --> 00:40:27,405
that Haskell was still here
in Vegas.

00:40:27,405 --> 00:40:29,403
And now you think he isn't?

00:40:29,403 --> 00:40:30,726
Eight weeks ago,

00:40:30,726 --> 00:40:35,264
Haskell escaped from custody
with Vivian's help.

00:40:36,409 --> 00:40:40,836
Then he went to Dr. Kole's
for plastic surgery.

00:40:40,836 --> 00:40:44,404
Then he and Tina

00:40:44,404 --> 00:40:47,076
started making movies
of Vivian in the old house

00:40:47,076 --> 00:40:48,409
to send to Daddy.

00:40:48,409 --> 00:40:50,212
Nate was careful
to stay in the background.

00:40:50,212 --> 00:40:54,411
He didn't want us to know
that he'd changed his face.

00:40:54,411 --> 00:40:56,411
Then he sent the two brides

00:40:56,411 --> 00:40:59,403
to kill the doctor
and the nurse.

00:40:59,403 --> 00:41:01,406
They removed his chart
but not before they kidnapped

00:41:01,406 --> 00:41:03,404
the patient on the table,

00:41:03,404 --> 00:41:07,897
took his car, his clothes,
and the two bodies,

00:41:07,897 --> 00:41:10,407
<i>brought them back to the house</i>
<i>where they murdered him.</i>

00:41:11,901 --> 00:41:13,769
(both women laughing)

00:41:17,173 --> 00:41:19,208
LANGSTON:
<i>And that's when</i>
<i>bride turned on bride.</i>

00:41:21,777 --> 00:41:25,404
<i>Then Tina murdered Vivian.</i>

00:41:25,404 --> 00:41:28,784
Now Tina starts
to chop up the bodies.

00:41:28,784 --> 00:41:32,788
<i>She disperses</i>
<i>the body parts sloppily,</i>

00:41:32,788 --> 00:41:35,024
<i>scattering them,</i>
<i>not unlike her scattered mind.</i>

00:41:35,024 --> 00:41:36,405
(laughing)

00:41:38,861 --> 00:41:41,410
Two days later,
Tina shows up in a park

00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:44,266
to keep an eye on Mr. Tinsdale.

00:41:44,266 --> 00:41:45,735
Then she disappears.

00:41:45,735 --> 00:41:47,203
WILLOWS:
Haskell and Tina--

00:41:47,203 --> 00:41:49,071
they're both fugitives.

00:41:49,071 --> 00:41:51,707
Traveling as a couple draws
less attention.

00:41:51,707 --> 00:41:54,343
So Haskell's got a new face,
$2 million,

00:41:54,343 --> 00:41:56,212
trades in his old bride
for a younger one

00:41:56,212 --> 00:41:58,147
and gets a new car in the deal.

00:41:58,147 --> 00:42:02,752
Plastic surgery,
cash, bimbo, Porsche.

00:42:02,752 --> 00:42:04,754
BRASS: Well, if he's
not in Vegas,

00:42:04,754 --> 00:42:07,409
I can think of another
place he might fit in.

00:42:07,409 --> 00:42:10,405
We need to call LAPD.

00:42:10,405 --> 00:42:13,405
(cello music playing)

00:42:37,409 --> 00:42:40,409
♪ ♪

00:42:48,898 --> 00:42:50,900
(applause)

00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:02,403
Thank you.

00:43:08,284 --> 00:43:11,408
Isn't she just heavenly?

00:43:11,408 --> 00:43:13,408
I think so.

00:43:13,408 --> 00:43:15,408
She's my wife.

00:43:16,409 --> 00:43:18,894
Really!

00:43:18,894 --> 00:43:21,030
You're a very lucky man.
