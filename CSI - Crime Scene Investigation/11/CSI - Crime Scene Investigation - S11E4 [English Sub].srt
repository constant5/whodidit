or did she survive by design?

00:08:35,538 --> 00:08:38,841
All right, now, based on the
messages he left, it's obvious

00:08:38,841 --> 00:08:41,010
that he didn't approve
of her Key to the City.

00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:42,612
And the child in the wheelchair

00:08:42,612 --> 00:08:44,981

with him.

00:08:44,981 --> 00:08:47,984

it was personal, Nick.

00:08:47,984 --> 00:08:51,120
He's been in and out
of her house multiple times.

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,722
He could have killed her
whenever he wanted to.

00:08:52,722 --> 00:08:54,090
Why tonight?

00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:56,163
I think the answer
is in these messages he left.

00:08:56,163 --> 00:08:57,860
I mean, it can't be
in the fingerprints,

00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,096

make sense to you?

00:09:03,162 --> 00:09:05,162
No, but I bet it makes
a lot of sense to him.

00:09:05,162 --> 00:09:07,570

00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:09,164

00:10:25,882 --> 00:10:28,169
Looks like his spirit
lived on, though.

00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:31,554

00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:42,170
He's, he's been
reading her mail.

00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:44,547
These envelope
lips are rippled.

00:13:44,547 --> 00:13:45,981
It's pretty obvious
they've been steamed open.

00:13:45,981 --> 00:13:49,085
You and Margot have
something in common.

00:13:49,085 --> 00:13:51,165
Yeah, what's that?

00:13:51,165 --> 00:13:52,165
A stalker.

00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:53,889
That was a long time ago.

00:13:53,889 --> 00:13:56,166
(grunts)

00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:58,994
Nick.

00:13:58,994 --> 00:14:00,863
Hmm?

00:14:00,863 --> 00:14:02,170
Help me with this bed.

00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:05,034
Yeah.

00:14:18,168 --> 00:14:20,783
Looks like they were
sleeping together.

00:14:22,651 --> 00:14:24,887
But he never touched her
until last night.

00:14:29,162 --> 00:14:30,169
Margot Wilton's
house is a bust--

00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:31,927
no fingerprints,
no trace, no DNA.

00:14:31,927 --> 00:14:36,565
As of right now, the guy we're
chasing is forensic-proof.

00:14:36,565 --> 00:14:37,833
He'd be the first.

00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:42,037
Which leads us
to the Hourglass of Evidence.

00:14:42,037 --> 00:14:43,706
Now, normally,

00:14:43,706 --> 00:14:45,165
we collect evidence,
we analyze it,

00:14:45,165 --> 00:14:47,169
it leads us to the truth,
but here we have

00:14:47,169 --> 00:14:50,112
the absence
of individualized evidence,

00:14:50,112 --> 00:14:52,170
so let's flip...

00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:54,170
the hourglass.

00:14:56,165 --> 00:14:57,953
The absence of evidence
is evidence.

00:14:57,953 --> 00:15:00,170
And from that,
we can draw certain conclusions.

00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:03,169
So the suspect went
in and out of the house

00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:05,161
through a small window.

00:15:05,161 --> 00:15:07,169
So he's small.
Which is consistent

00:15:07,169 --> 00:15:09,732
with the dust void
under her bed.

00:15:09,732 --> 00:15:10,933
No more than five-eight.

00:15:10,933 --> 00:15:12,902
WILLOWS:
He's agile.

00:15:12,902 --> 00:15:15,004
Virtually spider-walked
off of her bed--

00:15:15,004 --> 00:15:16,163
foot, hand,
hand, foot.

00:15:16,163 --> 00:15:17,167
LANGSTON:
So we have

00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:20,075
a possible male,
slight build, medium height,

00:15:20,075 --> 00:15:22,111
physically fit,

00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,112
younger rather than older.

00:15:23,112 --> 00:15:25,781
And... maniacally patient.

00:15:25,781 --> 00:15:29,169
He sat in the attic eating
oranges, watching Margot Wilton

00:15:29,169 --> 00:15:33,122
for possibly weeks, even months.

00:15:33,122 --> 00:15:34,723
Lying under her bed,
reading her mail,

00:15:34,723 --> 00:15:37,560
invading her life
without her ever knowing it.

00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,661
He's diabolical.

00:15:38,661 --> 00:15:42,161
So, by analyzing
what's not there,

00:15:42,161 --> 00:15:45,100
we begin to fill
the bottom of the hourglass,

00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,703
which leads us to...

00:15:52,007 --> 00:15:54,165
...the truth.

00:15:54,165 --> 00:15:58,581
Let's reanalyze the
evidence with fresh eyes.

00:16:09,858 --> 00:16:12,061
Looks like urine.

00:16:12,061 --> 00:16:16,169
But it's not in the
appropriate anatomical region.

00:16:18,169 --> 00:16:21,003
(sniffs)

00:16:22,037 --> 00:16:24,165
Doesn't smell
like urine.

00:16:24,165 --> 00:16:26,542
You know, uh, Grissom
would have tasted that.

00:16:27,576 --> 00:16:29,979
Could be sweat.

00:16:29,979 --> 00:16:32,081
It fluoresces
the same as urine.

00:16:32,081 --> 00:16:33,082
So you're saying

00:16:33,082 --> 00:16:34,917
only his spine
was sweating?

00:16:34,917 --> 00:16:36,518
Spines don't have sweat glands.

00:16:36,518 --> 00:16:38,854
Well, if it is sweat,
then we can get epithelials.

00:16:38,854 --> 00:16:41,167
Hm. Run DNA.

00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:44,126
No sweat.

00:17:13,656 --> 00:17:17,626
♪ ♪

00:17:29,471 --> 00:17:32,608
Wish I could say
I don't have a fetish, but I do.

00:17:32,608 --> 00:17:35,161
Should I shut the door?

00:17:35,161 --> 00:17:37,813
Amylase confirmed

00:17:37,813 --> 00:17:39,548
that the carpet stain

00:17:39,548 --> 00:17:40,549
was sweat.

00:17:40,549 --> 00:17:42,084
DNA was compromised,

00:17:42,084 --> 00:17:44,166
so it was a dead end there,
but the sweat

00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:45,821
was not alone.

00:17:45,821 --> 00:17:47,089
What was with it?
Well,

00:17:47,089 --> 00:17:48,924
here's where the fetish
comes in.

00:17:48,924 --> 00:17:50,926
Found trace amounts

00:17:50,926 --> 00:17:52,628
of silicone,
cyclopentasiloxane,

00:17:52,628 --> 00:17:53,862
and other components

00:17:53,862 --> 00:17:57,599
that are commonly found
in latex fetish sprays.

00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:01,503
Primary use is to slide on
skintight latex suits.

00:18:01,503 --> 00:18:02,705
Hmm.

00:18:02,705 --> 00:18:05,941
The victim said her attacker
was a black male adult

00:18:05,941 --> 00:18:07,163
who felt slippery.

00:18:07,163 --> 00:18:08,510
He was probably wearing latex.

00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:09,678
With a zipper

00:18:09,678 --> 00:18:11,168
up the back.

00:18:11,168 --> 00:18:12,170
Which explains

00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:14,162
why his spine
was sweating.

00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:19,165
(singsongy):
Time to get kinky.

00:18:21,165 --> 00:18:23,125
I knew I should've
shut the door.

00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:40,166
WILLOWS:
Doberman head, nice.

00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:42,163
That's new.

00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:43,479
What do you mean
"that's new"?

00:18:43,479 --> 00:18:45,781
You got to keep up
with these things, Nicky.

00:18:45,781 --> 00:18:47,816
All sex crimes start
with fantasies.

00:18:47,816 --> 00:18:50,161
When it goes from the big head
to the little head,

00:18:50,161 --> 00:18:51,954
that's where we come in.
You follow?

00:18:51,954 --> 00:18:54,123
I mean, you didn't think I came
in here recreationally, did you?

00:18:54,123 --> 00:18:56,658
I don't know, you just referred
to a dog mask in a sex shop

00:18:56,658 --> 00:18:57,659
as "nice" and "new."

00:18:57,659 --> 00:18:59,061
I had to ask.

00:18:59,061 --> 00:19:00,462
You okay?

00:19:00,462 --> 00:19:01,563
Are you?

00:19:01,563 --> 00:19:02,698
MAN:
Catherine!

00:19:02,698 --> 00:19:04,566
Hey!
Hey, I got your call.

00:19:04,566 --> 00:19:05,901
Got that
multispeed hoo-hah

00:19:05,901 --> 00:19:07,469
they ordered for you.

00:19:07,469 --> 00:19:09,170
It was hot
pink, right?

00:19:10,706 --> 00:19:12,908
I'm kidding.

00:19:12,908 --> 00:19:15,162
Joey's been a great resource
for all my sex crimes.

00:19:15,162 --> 00:19:16,712
STOKES:
So...

00:19:16,712 --> 00:19:18,981
latex?
Mm!

00:19:18,981 --> 00:19:21,164
What is our suspect into?

00:19:21,164 --> 00:19:22,584
Well, according
to our trace tech,

00:19:22,584 --> 00:19:25,168
it's a silicone-based
fetish spray.

00:19:25,168 --> 00:19:28,165
To put on latex,
preferably skintight latex.

00:19:28,165 --> 00:19:29,491
It's probably full-body.

00:19:29,491 --> 00:19:32,561
Okay, let's talk
silicone spray.

00:19:32,561 --> 00:19:34,062
You know,
I only carry one brand.

00:19:34,062 --> 00:19:35,931
It's a pretty slow mover.

00:19:35,931 --> 00:19:39,161
I did sell a couple bottles,
though, about six months ago,

00:19:39,161 --> 00:19:41,162
to a guy who, uh...

00:19:41,162 --> 00:19:44,039
oh, he custom-ordered
two latex head-to-toes.

00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:45,874
Head-to-toes?
Yeah.

00:19:45,874 --> 00:19:47,168
It's full head gear,
gloves, booties.

00:19:47,168 --> 00:19:50,045
Every inch covered except for
the eyes, the nose, the mouth.

00:19:50,045 --> 00:19:52,514
Well, I know you keep
some kind of records.

00:19:52,514 --> 00:19:54,049
Oh, come on,
I got more than that.

00:19:54,049 --> 00:19:55,984
I got concept drawings,
I got photos.

00:19:55,984 --> 00:19:57,486
I made the suits myself.

00:19:57,486 --> 00:20:01,590
Took me a couple days, but
they turned out just so great.

00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:02,591
Photos?

00:20:02,591 --> 00:20:05,894
I mean, you have
a picture of him?

00:20:05,894 --> 00:20:07,163
Yep.

00:20:10,632 --> 00:20:13,635
This explains the sweat
stain in the dust void.

00:20:13,635 --> 00:20:15,037
He was sweating
through his zipper.

00:20:15,037 --> 00:20:19,741
Do you have anything with him
without the mask?

00:20:19,741 --> 00:20:20,876
He wouldn't allow it.

00:20:20,876 --> 00:20:22,167
That's a pretty tough ask
in a place

00:20:22,167 --> 00:20:24,168
like this.
Sure.

00:20:24,168 --> 00:20:25,168
Heterochromia.

00:20:25,168 --> 00:20:26,782
One blue eye, one brown.

00:20:26,782 --> 00:20:27,816
Hmm.

00:20:27,816 --> 00:20:29,166
You got anything else
on this guy?

00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:30,752
I don't know, let me check.

00:20:30,752 --> 00:20:32,754
I remember
he wouldn't leave an address,

00:20:32,754 --> 00:20:35,491
he always paid cash,
but... look at that.

00:20:35,491 --> 00:20:37,162
Did leave a name.

00:20:38,163 --> 00:20:40,929
Ian Moone.

00:20:45,801 --> 00:20:47,803
(computer beeping)

00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,042
(clicks tongue)

00:21:01,016 --> 00:21:03,161
(mumbling):
Ian Moone.

00:21:05,161 --> 00:21:07,756
Ian...

00:21:09,858 --> 00:21:12,166
Moone.

00:21:18,161 --> 00:21:20,769
One.

00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:36,167
"I am no one."

00:21:51,934 --> 00:21:54,165
Uh, be sure to
lock your doors.

00:21:54,165 --> 00:21:55,167
Okay.

00:21:55,167 --> 00:21:56,167
GIRL:
Go, Mommy.

00:21:56,167 --> 00:21:58,167
Car wash! Yay!

00:21:58,167 --> 00:21:59,474
It's on a timer, sweetie.

00:21:59,474 --> 00:22:01,166
Sit back and relax,
put your earbuds in.

00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:02,678
Listen to your music.

00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:09,585
Hey. It's me.

00:22:15,991 --> 00:22:18,162
I'm at the car wash.

00:22:18,162 --> 00:22:21,463
A-And I'm sorry I couldn't
get away earlier to talk, but...

00:22:21,463 --> 00:22:23,498
Yeah.

00:22:23,498 --> 00:22:25,170
How's my Mr. Everything?

00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:28,770
GIRL:
Look, dolly, it's a bubble bath!

00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:30,165
Really! (laughs)

00:22:30,165 --> 00:22:31,740
Okay.

00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:34,168
You know I will.
I always do.

00:22:35,164 --> 00:22:37,079
I will
make it happen.

00:22:44,165 --> 00:22:45,162
I always do.

00:22:45,162 --> 00:22:48,090
I need to see you.

00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:50,162
No, I need to see all of you.

00:22:50,162 --> 00:22:51,960
Say good-bye!
(screams)

00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,062
(screaming)

00:22:54,062 --> 00:22:55,161
Help me! Help...!

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,161
(screaming, blade slashing)

00:23:03,105 --> 00:23:04,573
(screaming stops)

00:23:04,573 --> 00:23:06,908
(mechanisms whirring)

00:23:13,749 --> 00:23:16,169
(fingers squeaking)

00:23:17,686 --> 00:23:19,165
(squeaking)

00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,168
(screams)

00:23:29,865 --> 00:23:33,166
What do you think
the "A" stands for?

00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:35,704
Are you sure
it was just

00:23:35,704 --> 00:23:37,169
the mother and daughter
in the car?

00:23:37,169 --> 00:23:39,169
Yeah, just
the two, ma'am.

00:23:40,709 --> 00:23:43,165
Well, if they were alone
in a locked car,

00:23:43,165 --> 00:23:46,014
how the hell did
this happen, Greg?

00:24:03,932 --> 00:24:05,801
Catherine?

00:24:05,801 --> 00:24:07,569
Got blood back here.

00:24:07,569 --> 00:24:08,837
Mostly smears.

00:24:10,164 --> 00:24:12,941
Well, I've got half
of a bloody hand impression.

00:24:12,941 --> 00:24:14,710
So do I.

00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:19,748
Well, it appears that there was

00:24:19,748 --> 00:24:21,817
no blood on him
as he went to kill her,

00:24:21,817 --> 00:24:23,552
but he definitely left
traces of her blood

00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,586
as he was backing out.

00:24:28,023 --> 00:24:30,167
SANDERS: Blood transfer
on the hatch release.

00:24:33,962 --> 00:24:36,169
Carpet's bone-dry.

00:24:36,169 --> 00:24:38,100
He had to be in the car before

00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,001
it went through
the wash.

00:24:43,105 --> 00:24:45,162
Spare tire compartment.

00:24:45,162 --> 00:24:47,008
No tire.

00:24:47,008 --> 00:24:49,010
Is it possible
that the same guy

00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:50,846
who crawled through
the bathroom window

00:24:50,846 --> 00:24:53,849
fit into a space like this?

00:24:58,166 --> 00:25:00,856
Well, if he was here,
where did he go?

00:25:00,856 --> 00:25:04,493
And how did he get away
without being seen?

00:25:07,168 --> 00:25:09,664
425A! Suspect
on the premises!

00:25:24,164 --> 00:25:25,981
Greg, flashlight.

00:25:40,695 --> 00:25:42,931
Damn it!
Who turned on the water?

00:25:42,931 --> 00:25:45,167
MAN (shouting):
Shut it down! Shut it down!

00:25:47,669 --> 00:25:51,740
Alise... I know you don't
want to talk to anybody,

00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,168
and I know you're scared,

00:25:53,168 --> 00:25:56,778
but I'm a policeman and
I'm trying to do my job, so,

00:25:56,778 --> 00:25:58,169
I thought maybe
we'd play a little game.

00:25:58,169 --> 00:26:00,081
Maybe... if you let me,

00:26:00,081 --> 00:26:02,165
I... I'll talk to your doll.

00:26:02,165 --> 00:26:04,619
Would that be okay?

00:26:07,589 --> 00:26:09,161
Great. Thank you.

00:26:09,161 --> 00:26:11,626
Hello, doll.

00:26:11,626 --> 00:26:13,163
My name is James.

00:26:13,163 --> 00:26:15,030
I'm trying
to help Alise

00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:16,498
out of a tough spot.

00:26:16,498 --> 00:26:19,935
So can you tell me,
was anyone else in the car

00:26:19,935 --> 00:26:21,603
with Alise and her mom?

00:26:23,161 --> 00:26:25,006
No, huh?

00:26:25,006 --> 00:26:26,675
You know, I want to believe you,

00:26:26,675 --> 00:26:28,166
but, uh, there
had to be somebody.

00:26:28,166 --> 00:26:30,478
Maybe you just
didn't see him?

00:26:30,478 --> 00:26:31,713
Maybe you...

00:26:31,713 --> 00:26:33,582
and Alise were watching
the car wash?

00:26:36,651 --> 00:26:38,166
Yeah.

00:26:38,166 --> 00:26:40,165
Well, let me ask you
something: is there...

00:26:40,165 --> 00:26:42,164
is there anything
that you could tell me

00:26:42,164 --> 00:26:44,860
that would help me
catch the man that
hurt Alise's mom?

00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:47,168
You can even whisper it,
if you want.

00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:49,097
It's okay.
Whisper it in my ear.

00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:55,169
Sqwee... gel.

00:26:55,169 --> 00:26:58,168
Excuse me?
Could you say that again?

00:26:59,169 --> 00:27:02,165
Sqwee... gel.

00:27:02,165 --> 00:27:03,163
MAN:
Where is she?

00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:04,946
Alise!
Daddy!

00:27:04,946 --> 00:27:06,915
Oh, baby.

00:27:06,915 --> 00:27:08,166
Oh, my baby.

00:27:08,166 --> 00:27:10,162
(whispers):
Oh, my baby.

00:27:10,162 --> 00:27:11,720
Oh, my girl.

00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,121
My girl.

00:27:23,163 --> 00:27:26,168
Do you know anyone
who would want to
harm your wife?

00:27:26,168 --> 00:27:28,003
Oh...

00:27:28,003 --> 00:27:29,604
Uh...

00:27:29,604 --> 00:27:31,640
Actually, yes.

00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,162
Really?

00:27:33,162 --> 00:27:35,477
BRASS:
<i>Explain that.</i>

00:27:35,477 --> 00:27:38,163
MAN:<i>My wife, uh...</i>
<i>she was recently appointed</i>

00:27:38,163 --> 00:27:41,816
to the Family Values Committee
in, uh, Clark County.

00:27:41,816 --> 00:27:43,685
She got there
because she...

00:27:43,685 --> 00:27:46,054
she single-handedly
went up against these...

00:27:46,054 --> 00:27:47,889
these big video game companies

00:27:47,889 --> 00:27:51,760
<i>and banned the sale</i>
<i>of, uh,Vehicular Manslaughter</i>

00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,162
<i>and all those other violent</i>
<i>first-person games, to minors.</i>

00:27:55,162 --> 00:27:57,799
Minors.

00:27:57,799 --> 00:27:59,164
Kids.

00:27:59,164 --> 00:28:02,164
<i>Did she receive any, uh,</i>

00:28:02,164 --> 00:28:05,740
<i>crank calls or hate mail,</i>
<i>death threats?</i>

00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:08,076
Much more than that.
Really?

00:28:08,076 --> 00:28:09,577
Someone broke into our home.

00:28:11,479 --> 00:28:13,165
<i>I was at work.</i>

00:28:13,165 --> 00:28:15,161
<i>Alise was at day care.</i>

00:28:15,161 --> 00:28:16,166
Uh, hey, Doc?

00:28:16,166 --> 00:28:18,161
<i>This guy, he...</i>

00:28:18,161 --> 00:28:20,488
he put my wife in the hospital.

00:28:20,488 --> 00:28:23,169
Okay? He cut her up real bad.

00:28:25,627 --> 00:28:27,562
ROBBINS: Carrie Jones,
our car wash victim,

00:28:27,562 --> 00:28:29,464
was attacked twice.

00:28:29,464 --> 00:28:31,666
Most recent was a few hours ago.

00:28:31,666 --> 00:28:35,470
The first attack was probably
no more than a few weeks ago.

00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:36,705
PHILLIPS:
Both are sharp-force injuries.

00:28:36,705 --> 00:28:38,940
What's your guess
on weapon of choice?

00:28:39,908 --> 00:28:42,477
Could be a box cutter.

00:28:42,477 --> 00:28:43,645
Maybe a straight razor.

00:28:43,645 --> 00:28:44,779
Mm-hmm.

00:28:46,548 --> 00:28:48,049
Ray.
Hey.

00:28:48,049 --> 00:28:51,720
C.O.D. is sharp-force
injuries to the neck.

00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,888
Severed the carotid.

00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:55,168
All the other wounds
are defensive.

00:28:57,170 --> 00:29:00,165
LANGSTON:
Some old... some new.

00:29:00,165 --> 00:29:03,965
I had a conversation with
my gut on the way down here.

00:29:03,965 --> 00:29:07,602
I just want to see
if my suspicions are correct.

00:29:07,602 --> 00:29:09,004
We have...

00:29:09,004 --> 00:29:13,108
identical wounds,
similar in length,

00:29:13,108 --> 00:29:14,776
double-edged blade.

00:29:14,776 --> 00:29:16,167
That means
whoever attacked

00:29:16,167 --> 00:29:20,169
Margot Wilton...
killed Carrie Jones.

00:29:21,683 --> 00:29:24,165
I need to see what
was under her bed.

00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:31,168
STOKES:
Dust void.

00:29:31,168 --> 00:29:32,594
Well, he was definitely here.

00:29:36,163 --> 00:29:38,169
BRASS:
Sqweegel.

00:29:39,601 --> 00:29:42,504
That's the name
the little girl gave the killer.

00:29:42,504 --> 00:29:45,940
She was in the car
at the car wash when
her mother was killed.

00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,776
Now, I'm guessing is,
Sqweegel is the sound

00:29:47,776 --> 00:29:50,879
that the mops make as
they go back and forth
across the windshield.

00:29:50,879 --> 00:29:52,013
Sqweegel, you know?

00:29:52,013 --> 00:29:53,161
LANGSTON:
Yeah.

00:29:53,161 --> 00:29:55,050
Traumatic
memory image.

00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:56,951
Oh, I got traumatic
memory image for you.

00:29:56,951 --> 00:29:58,520
Deja vu.

00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:01,161
This is Margot Wilton's
place all over again.

00:30:01,161 --> 00:30:04,059
You got same M.O.,
jimmied bathroom window,

00:30:04,059 --> 00:30:06,168
multiple entries
and exits-- I bet if

00:30:06,168 --> 00:30:08,168
we all look up,
we'll find a hole

00:30:08,168 --> 00:30:10,165
with a lipstick cam in it,
no prints,

00:30:10,165 --> 00:30:12,168
no DNA.

00:30:12,168 --> 00:30:14,502
There it is.

00:30:14,502 --> 00:30:16,162
I'm on it.

00:30:20,542 --> 00:30:21,910
STOKES:
Got something here.

00:30:24,946 --> 00:30:26,714
Ray, get a shot of this.

00:30:26,714 --> 00:30:28,483
Uh-huh.

00:30:40,662 --> 00:30:43,164
The letter "A."

00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:47,669
Just like the car wash.

00:30:47,669 --> 00:30:49,671
(passionate breathing)

00:30:51,005 --> 00:30:53,169
Lucky for you,
I hate my husband.

00:30:53,169 --> 00:30:57,163
I'll take football over
car insurance any day.

00:30:57,163 --> 00:30:58,580
LANGSTON:
Car insurance.

00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:00,515
Mr. Jones...

00:31:00,515 --> 00:31:02,884
what do you do
for a living?

00:31:02,884 --> 00:31:05,687
Turn it off.
Just turn it off, please.
Very well.

00:31:07,922 --> 00:31:11,170
I can't imagine how difficult
this must be for you,

00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:13,165
Mr. Jones, but
unfortunately,

00:31:13,165 --> 00:31:16,169
I do have to ask you
another question.

00:31:16,169 --> 00:31:20,164
Now, we found this, uh...

00:31:20,164 --> 00:31:22,637
DVD under your bed.

00:31:24,005 --> 00:31:27,876
Now, did you hire a P.I.
to follow your wife?

00:31:27,876 --> 00:31:30,169
Well, why would
I do that?

00:31:30,169 --> 00:31:32,580
You tell me.

00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:35,049
She's the chair
of the Family Values Committee.

00:31:35,049 --> 00:31:38,887
Her whole life has
been about the truth,

00:31:38,887 --> 00:31:42,724
honesty and morality.

00:31:45,727 --> 00:31:47,695
That's what he meant.

00:31:47,695 --> 00:31:50,163
What are you talking about?
That's what he meant.

00:31:50,163 --> 00:31:51,169
When Carrie was attacked,

00:31:51,169 --> 00:31:53,168
she told the police, she said,

00:31:53,168 --> 00:31:57,169
that animal,
he kept saying to her...

00:31:57,169 --> 00:31:58,840
"I know.

00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,542
Confess."

00:32:02,644 --> 00:32:04,479
She said she didn't
know what her attacker

00:32:04,479 --> 00:32:06,080
was talking about--
I think she did.

00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,616
That scarlet letter
on the windshield can
only mean one thing.

00:32:08,616 --> 00:32:11,169
Well, she had a dirty
little secret-- she
was a party girl,

00:32:11,169 --> 00:32:13,521
cheating on her husband
who didn't have a clue.

00:32:13,521 --> 00:32:14,923
But Sqweegel did.

00:32:14,923 --> 00:32:17,759
Now, he attacked Carrie
two weeks ago,

00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:20,161
didn't kill her,
leaves her alive

00:32:20,161 --> 00:32:21,829
with the message:
"I know. Confess."

00:32:21,829 --> 00:32:23,464
Gave her a chance
to repent.

00:32:23,464 --> 00:32:24,566
I guess she didn't,

00:32:24,566 --> 00:32:26,166
because he killed her
in the car wash.

00:32:26,166 --> 00:32:28,503
My thought is,
he gave Margot Wilton

00:32:28,503 --> 00:32:30,169
the chance to repent as well,

00:32:30,169 --> 00:32:33,641
and if she hasn't,
her life's still in danger.

00:32:33,641 --> 00:32:35,165
MARGOT:
<i>I have lived there</i>

00:32:35,165 --> 00:32:37,912
for 45 years, and
I want to go home.

00:32:37,912 --> 00:32:40,848
The department
has the resources
to put you in a hotel

00:32:40,848 --> 00:32:43,651
and provide round-
the-clock security.
I don't want to go to a hotel.

00:32:43,651 --> 00:32:45,520
With a bunch of strangers
next to me?

00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:49,165
Chances of that guy coming back
are a million to one.

00:32:49,165 --> 00:32:51,165
You weren't his only victim.

00:32:51,165 --> 00:32:52,961
Gentlemen,

00:32:52,961 --> 00:32:54,629
this is an
unauthorized interview.

00:32:54,629 --> 00:32:57,465
You're compromising Mrs.
Wilton's right to counsel,

00:32:57,465 --> 00:32:59,167
not to mention
her freedom of movement.

00:32:59,167 --> 00:33:00,635
Need I remind you--

00:33:00,635 --> 00:33:02,670
she's a victim, not a suspect.

00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:04,706
Oscar, we're just trying
to keep her safe, that's all.

00:33:04,706 --> 00:33:05,807
Oh, Jim,
quit with the fear tactics.

00:33:05,807 --> 00:33:07,675
LANGSTON: No fear tactics,
Mayor Goodman.

00:33:07,675 --> 00:33:09,877
We have every reason to
believe that the first
attack was a warning.

00:33:09,877 --> 00:33:11,813
I'll take my chances.

00:33:11,813 --> 00:33:13,167
Please take me home.

00:33:13,167 --> 00:33:15,683
Jim, I need a minute
with her.
All right. Oscar.

00:33:15,683 --> 00:33:18,163
I need to talk to you
privately, please. Over here.

00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:22,166
Yes?

00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:24,161
I just need one minute.

00:33:26,694 --> 00:33:29,162
"I know.

00:33:29,162 --> 00:33:30,798
Confess."

00:33:33,169 --> 00:33:37,038
Your attacker said the same
thing to a young mother.

00:33:37,038 --> 00:33:39,167
Two weeks ago,
he attacked her at home,

00:33:39,167 --> 00:33:41,876
gave her a warning,
now she's dead.

00:33:41,876 --> 00:33:45,713
What does he want you
to confess, Margot?

00:33:45,713 --> 00:33:48,168
What does he know
that you're not telling us?

00:33:48,168 --> 00:33:51,164
Does it have something to do
with your son

00:33:51,164 --> 00:33:53,165
or the Key to the City?

00:33:54,166 --> 00:33:57,168
Your minute's up.

00:34:10,805 --> 00:34:13,675
If you so much
knock on that door,

00:34:13,675 --> 00:34:16,165
I'll have you in court
tomorrow on harassment.

00:34:19,165 --> 00:34:21,683
Pardon my bark;
she's a friend.

00:34:21,683 --> 00:34:25,161
Go over my head,
and I'll kill you.

00:34:53,169 --> 00:34:54,682
No.

00:34:55,583 --> 00:34:57,852
No. No!

00:35:11,933 --> 00:35:14,163
(labored breathing)

00:35:19,841 --> 00:35:20,942
(shouts)

00:35:20,942 --> 00:35:23,166
Looking for your letters?

00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:31,052
(Margot yells)

00:35:35,089 --> 00:35:36,891
What's going on, Akers?

00:35:36,891 --> 00:35:38,162
Got a call about
an abandoned vehicle.

00:35:38,162 --> 00:35:39,165
One of our guys
ran the plates

00:35:39,165 --> 00:35:40,795
and it came back
to one of ours.

00:35:40,795 --> 00:35:42,162
Yeah? Whose is it?
Ryan Fink.

00:35:42,162 --> 00:35:43,898
You know that hero paramedic
who saved all those kids?

00:35:43,898 --> 00:35:45,170
Yeah, yeah,
I know who that is.

00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:48,503
AKERS: This is the car the city
gave him for saving the kids.

00:35:48,503 --> 00:35:50,104
It's locked up.

00:35:50,104 --> 00:35:52,165
Looks like I got
some blood.

00:35:52,165 --> 00:35:53,808
Hand me your stick.

00:35:56,043 --> 00:35:59,162
Exigent circumstances.
Watch yourself.

00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:18,168
(labored breathing,
latex squeaking)

00:36:34,162 --> 00:36:36,851
(screaming)

00:36:36,851 --> 00:36:38,653
(shouting, gasping)

00:36:38,653 --> 00:36:41,169
(yelling)

00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:51,632
(panting)

00:36:55,164 --> 00:36:59,165
(screaming)

00:36:59,165 --> 00:37:01,108
BRASS: This is not
the kind of situation
where you just stand by

00:37:01,108 --> 00:37:03,010
and wait, okay? We gotta go in.
Help me out here.

00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:05,161
Hey.
Give me the green light.
Okay. I'll stand by and wait.

00:37:05,161 --> 00:37:07,815
I just found blood all
over Ryan Fink's car,

00:37:07,815 --> 00:37:09,168
enough to presume
he's dead.

00:37:09,168 --> 00:37:10,918
Carrie Jones, Ryan Fink,
Margot Wilton--

00:37:10,918 --> 00:37:13,521
all three honored by the city
and now two of them are dead.

00:37:13,521 --> 00:37:14,922
I guarantee you she's next.

00:37:14,922 --> 00:37:16,891
The whole team's right
behind me. Let's go in.

00:37:26,901 --> 00:37:29,670
(moans)

00:37:39,514 --> 00:37:41,816
(grunts)

00:37:41,816 --> 00:37:45,119
What do you want from me?

00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:47,588
I think you know.

00:37:47,588 --> 00:37:50,167
I don't know anything.

00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:53,794
You know everything.

00:37:53,794 --> 00:37:56,664
I read your letters.

00:37:56,664 --> 00:38:00,167
I heard your phone calls.

00:38:00,167 --> 00:38:04,839
I even watched
while you slept.

00:38:04,839 --> 00:38:09,164
I know why you toss
and turn at night.

00:38:09,164 --> 00:38:13,481
It's hard to be still
in Robbie's nightmare.

00:38:13,481 --> 00:38:16,162
(strains):
He was my baby.

00:38:16,162 --> 00:38:18,653
(sobs)
He was so sick, he was in pain.

00:38:18,653 --> 00:38:24,125
He'd cry, every night,
in his chair.

00:38:24,125 --> 00:38:25,560
He was trapped and so was I.

00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,161
Tell me about the pool.

00:38:27,161 --> 00:38:29,864
How your son's death
was an act of mercy.

00:38:29,864 --> 00:38:31,065
A mother's love.

00:38:31,065 --> 00:38:32,164
Oh, you bastard.

00:38:32,164 --> 00:38:33,935
You don't know
the whole story.

00:38:33,935 --> 00:38:34,969
I know everything!

00:38:34,969 --> 00:38:36,637
All right!

00:38:36,637 --> 00:38:39,073
All right,
I know that you know.

00:38:39,073 --> 00:38:43,166
But you have to understand,
my son was dying.

00:38:43,166 --> 00:38:44,579
Say it.

00:38:45,613 --> 00:38:49,168
Robbie drowned...

00:38:49,168 --> 00:38:54,162
and it was not an accident.

00:38:54,162 --> 00:38:58,559
I killed him.

00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:01,495
I<i>murderedmy son,</i>

00:39:01,495 --> 00:39:03,664
'cause I believed

00:39:03,664 --> 00:39:08,469
in my heart that it was
the right thing to do.

00:39:15,109 --> 00:39:17,111
Mrs. Wilton?

00:39:17,111 --> 00:39:19,166
Are you hurt?
I shot him.

00:39:19,166 --> 00:39:21,649
Which way'd he go?
I don't know.
I shot him.

00:39:21,649 --> 00:39:22,783
Five shots,
no blood?

00:39:22,783 --> 00:39:25,162
The case mouths are crimped.
He replaced

00:39:25,162 --> 00:39:26,854
her real ammo with blanks.
This guy thought of everything.

00:39:26,854 --> 00:39:28,923
BRASS:
Mitch, get her out of here.

00:39:28,923 --> 00:39:29,857
Nick, check upstairs.

00:39:29,857 --> 00:39:31,025
The rest of you, on me.

00:39:31,025 --> 00:39:32,162
Let's go find this bastard.

00:39:32,162 --> 00:39:33,165
Let's go.

00:39:35,963 --> 00:39:38,169
Lady, we've got to
get out of here now.

00:39:38,169 --> 00:39:40,901
No! My letters!

00:39:40,901 --> 00:39:42,167
My letters!

00:40:31,118 --> 00:40:32,163
Ray?

00:40:33,521 --> 00:40:35,164
It's all right.

00:40:38,659 --> 00:40:40,528
Tache noir.

00:40:40,528 --> 00:40:42,167
The exposed sclera
has gone black.

00:40:42,167 --> 00:40:44,164
(sniffs) He's got a little bit
of a stench

00:40:44,164 --> 00:40:45,900
coming off of him,
so he's been dead

00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,161
for a couple
of hours.

00:40:47,161 --> 00:40:48,167
How can that be?

00:40:48,167 --> 00:40:49,537
(grunts)

00:40:51,572 --> 00:40:54,575
That's Ryan Fink.

00:40:54,575 --> 00:40:56,110
The paramedic?

00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:57,712
STOKES:
Yup.

00:41:02,616 --> 00:41:05,161
LANGSTON:
You see the scars?

00:41:05,161 --> 00:41:06,921
Attacked first,

00:41:06,921 --> 00:41:08,923
then killed.

00:41:08,923 --> 00:41:11,169
Just like Carrie Jones.

00:41:11,169 --> 00:41:12,927
Whew!

00:41:12,927 --> 00:41:16,170
Margot Wilton was lucky.

00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:18,168
That's why he
bought two suits.

00:41:18,168 --> 00:41:20,168
But why put them
under the bed?

00:41:20,168 --> 00:41:22,169
I think our answer

00:41:22,169 --> 00:41:25,639
is in the wind.

00:41:49,897 --> 00:41:51,170
MARGOT:
<i>Dear Henry,</i>

00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:55,161
<i>I hope I have the courage</i>
<i>to send you this letter.</i>

00:41:55,161 --> 00:41:57,638
<i>Because you're his father,</i>

00:41:57,638 --> 00:42:00,574
<i>I owe you the truth</i>
<i>about our son.</i>

00:42:00,574 --> 00:42:03,169
<i>Robbie begged me</i>
<i>to end his suffering.</i>

00:42:03,169 --> 00:42:06,647
<i>He was failing,</i>
<i>more and more each day.</i>

00:42:06,647 --> 00:42:08,482
I can't.

00:42:08,482 --> 00:42:10,618
You can if you love me.

00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:19,026
<i>I did a terrible thing.</i>

00:42:22,863 --> 00:42:25,499
<i>I just stood there...</i>

00:42:25,499 --> 00:42:27,735
<i>watching him.</i>

00:42:27,735 --> 00:42:31,705
<i>I'll never forgive myself.</i>

00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:59,167
It's no wonder she insisted
on going back to her house.

00:42:59,167 --> 00:43:01,802
She needed to get the letters.

00:43:01,802 --> 00:43:03,166
That was her secret.

00:43:03,166 --> 00:43:05,162
BRASS:
I got a call from
the fire chief.

00:43:05,162 --> 00:43:06,974
Some tipsters have been calling

00:43:06,974 --> 00:43:09,109
the fire
department hotline.

00:43:09,109 --> 00:43:11,078
There's evidence this guy Fink
had been setting fires

00:43:11,078 --> 00:43:12,613
to make himself look
like a hero.

00:43:12,613 --> 00:43:15,783
That's <i>hissecret.</i>

00:43:15,783 --> 00:43:20,621
And the biggest secret of all:
who is Ian Moone?

00:43:27,761 --> 00:43:29,730
(labored breathing)

00:43:35,636 --> 00:43:38,397
I am no one.
