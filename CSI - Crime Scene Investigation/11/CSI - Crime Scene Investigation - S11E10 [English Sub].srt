00:00:05,417 --> 00:00:07,417
(scanner beeping)

00:00:21,161 --> 00:00:22,417
You blind, lady?

00:00:22,417 --> 00:00:24,418
Express checkout,
15 items or less.

00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:30,420
I'm sorry, how much is it?

00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:34,108
(Spanish rap music
playing outside)

00:00:39,046 --> 00:00:40,781
Holly, please stop.

00:00:40,781 --> 00:00:42,783
Sweetie, I'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry...

00:00:42,783 --> 00:00:45,419
What are you waiting for,
morning? Just pay!

00:00:48,412 --> 00:00:50,791
(cell phone ringing)

00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,796
I'm gonna have to write a check.

00:00:55,796 --> 00:00:56,931
Aw, come on! It's cash only!

00:01:00,234 --> 00:01:01,869
(Spanish rap music
playing outside)

00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:10,377
(Spanish rap music playing)

00:01:21,121 --> 00:01:22,256
Turn that crap down!

00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:26,226
Your noise-- turn it down!

00:01:26,226 --> 00:01:28,228
(turning up volume)

00:01:36,412 --> 00:01:39,873
(three gunshots)

00:01:41,875 --> 00:01:44,011
(gunshot)

00:02:02,229 --> 00:02:06,233
(sirens approaching)

00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:13,418
Well, I was needing to hit
the grocery store this morning.

00:02:13,418 --> 00:02:15,109
(camera shutter clicks)

00:02:15,109 --> 00:02:17,011
Looks like someone
had the same idea.

00:02:19,046 --> 00:02:21,420
BRASS: Shots were fired,
these two went down.

00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,317
Apparently,
this whole thing started

00:02:23,317 --> 00:02:25,185
because of musical differences.

00:02:25,185 --> 00:02:26,787
The smoker says the
gangbangers did it.

00:02:26,787 --> 00:02:28,856
There was a patrol
car in the area.

00:02:28,856 --> 00:02:32,420
They apprehended the gangbangers
in the lot, searched the car,

00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,128
didn't find a gun.

00:02:34,128 --> 00:02:35,129
Now, the
male victim--

00:02:35,129 --> 00:02:37,421
his name is
Hector Cortero.

00:02:37,421 --> 00:02:39,299
He's been working
here two weeks,

00:02:39,299 --> 00:02:40,418
and he's a cart collector.

00:02:40,418 --> 00:02:42,302
Prison tattoos.

00:02:42,302 --> 00:02:43,837
Shooting could be gang related.

00:02:43,837 --> 00:02:45,416
Yeah, now, the female victim--

00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:47,741
we don't know
who she is yet,

00:02:47,741 --> 00:02:49,009
but, uh, apparently,

00:02:49,009 --> 00:02:51,045
she's just an unlucky customer.

00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:53,347
One bag of groceries,
no purse,

00:02:53,347 --> 00:02:55,415
no keys, no cell
phone in her pocket.

00:02:55,415 --> 00:02:56,817
You know,
this could be a robbery.

00:02:56,817 --> 00:02:58,085
Bagger's prints
are in the system,

00:02:58,085 --> 00:02:59,086
but according to AFIS,

00:02:59,086 --> 00:03:00,418
his real name is Hector Atoya.

00:03:00,418 --> 00:03:01,755
He got a rap sheet?

00:03:01,755 --> 00:03:03,421
Yeah, he did one year
for a no-hit drive-by.

00:03:03,421 --> 00:03:06,193
This could be retaliation.

00:03:06,193 --> 00:03:09,730
<i>Second vic witnesses</i>
<i>and becomes collateral damage.</i>

00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,799
Bagger's only hit once.

00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:13,233
She's hit three times.

00:03:13,233 --> 00:03:15,413
Two small-caliber gunshot wounds

00:03:15,413 --> 00:03:17,371
to the left chest,
one to the right eye.

00:03:17,371 --> 00:03:19,840
Powder burns around
the wound suggest

00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,075
that it was at close range.

00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:23,413
Looks like an execution.

00:03:23,413 --> 00:03:26,213
Which would make our soccer mom
the primary target, but why?

00:03:26,213 --> 00:03:27,781
Hey, this, uh, jerk over here

00:03:27,781 --> 00:03:30,412
just told me that
our female vic had a kid.

00:03:30,412 --> 00:03:31,719
A kid?!

00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:33,020
You get a description?

00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,322
Yeah, little girl, about
three years old; blonde hair.

00:03:35,322 --> 00:03:37,418
Oh, and she had
two bags of groceries.

00:03:37,418 --> 00:03:42,413
She had a child
and two bags of groceries.

00:03:42,413 --> 00:03:44,732
I'm thinking she had a car.

00:03:44,732 --> 00:03:46,413
We have a void.

00:03:46,413 --> 00:03:49,269
Maybe a tire
crushed those pretzels.

00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:51,415
She puts the child in first,

00:03:51,415 --> 00:03:54,174
gets one bag of groceries
in the car and then...

00:03:54,174 --> 00:03:55,175
STOKES:
Bang.

00:03:55,175 --> 00:03:56,417
Killer jacks her ride,

00:03:56,417 --> 00:03:58,413
without knowing the kid's
in the backseat.

00:03:58,413 --> 00:04:00,814
Yeah, this is Brass.
I'm down at the double 419

00:04:00,814 --> 00:04:02,015
down at Honolulu.

00:04:02,015 --> 00:04:03,412
We have a stolen vehicle
with an abducted

00:04:03,412 --> 00:04:05,052
three-year-old
blonde female.

00:04:05,052 --> 00:04:07,420
We now have a 418/427.

00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,420

Mm-hmm.

00:04:56,737 --> 00:04:58,415
And had you seen her
in here before?

00:04:58,415 --> 00:04:59,418
Was she a regular?

00:04:59,418 --> 00:05:02,176
Oh, no. Uh-uh, no.

00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:03,377
I never saw her before.

00:05:03,377 --> 00:05:05,746
I've been working here
a few years.

00:05:05,746 --> 00:05:07,948
She had the cutest little kid
with her, too.

00:05:07,948 --> 00:05:09,417
She had too many items

00:05:09,417 --> 00:05:12,413
for the express line, but I
don't think that was on purpose.

00:05:12,413 --> 00:05:15,722
Just, she seemed
in a hurry and upset.

00:05:15,722 --> 00:05:16,757
Upset?

00:05:16,757 --> 00:05:17,958
Mm-hmm.

00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:19,226
How upset?

00:05:19,226 --> 00:05:21,420
First, I thought it was just
the guy behind her.

00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,414
The "Express Line Nazi."

00:05:23,414 --> 00:05:25,032
Yeah, yeah, we already
talked to him, but you think

00:05:25,032 --> 00:05:26,099
she was upset about
something else?

00:05:26,099 --> 00:05:27,413
Her hands were shaking.

00:05:27,413 --> 00:05:29,903
The whole time, she seemed like
she was about to cry.

00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:32,973
Oh, and her cell phone rang.

00:05:32,973 --> 00:05:33,974
Oh, it did?

00:05:33,974 --> 00:05:35,042
Mm-hmm.

00:05:35,042 --> 00:05:38,178
She didn't answer it.

00:05:38,178 --> 00:05:41,416
Express line, so she,
uh, she paid cash?

00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:43,416
No. She didn't have enough.

00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:45,252
I let her write a check.

00:05:45,252 --> 00:05:47,412
Hey, Archie, it's Nick.
Listen, I got a name

00:05:47,412 --> 00:05:50,257
and driver's license number
on our female victim.

00:05:50,257 --> 00:05:51,792

Daniel Moore.

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,415
Probably her husband.

00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:16,416
But registration's secured.

00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:19,119

00:06:19,119 --> 00:06:20,415
Hmm.

00:06:58,358 --> 00:07:02,129
Used to be the preferred caliber
for mobsters and assassins.

00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:05,415

move him to Autopsy

on the way out.

00:07:12,172 --> 00:07:14,041
I make no promises.

She's in the washroom.

But I... Hey.

00:07:25,417 --> 00:07:27,788
Whoa.

00:07:27,788 --> 00:07:28,420

I'm sorry for your loss,

00:07:36,863 --> 00:07:38,198
but that's all the more reason

00:07:38,198 --> 00:07:39,833
for you not
to be in here.

00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,412
No one should ever see
their loved one like this.

Let me see that.

00:07:54,417 --> 00:07:56,415

But I need you
to keep it together.

00:08:09,896 --> 00:08:10,864
Can you give me a second?
Yeah.

00:08:10,864 --> 00:08:12,032
Hold it up.

00:08:13,233 --> 00:08:15,736
Now, I know this is tough,

00:08:15,736 --> 00:08:17,237
but when a wife
is murdered,

00:08:17,237 --> 00:08:19,272
I got to ask the husband:

00:08:19,272 --> 00:08:21,413
do you have an alibi
for last night?

00:08:21,413 --> 00:08:23,210
I was on a case.

00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:25,078
I can save you
a lot of time.

00:08:25,078 --> 00:08:26,179
I know who killed Christine.

00:08:26,179 --> 00:08:28,982
The name is Rylan Gauss.

00:08:28,982 --> 00:08:31,852
And he has my daughter.

00:08:34,821 --> 00:08:36,289
Hey.
Hey.

00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:37,891
So I got an AG waiver

00:08:37,891 --> 00:08:40,360
on Christine Moore's
missing cell phone.

00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,962
She got a message five minutes
before she was killed.

00:08:41,962 --> 00:08:43,330
Checker at the market said

00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:45,098
Christine received a call
that she didn't answer.

00:08:45,098 --> 00:08:47,100
That was from
a Trent Moore.

00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,802
Guy sounds young.

00:08:48,802 --> 00:08:50,270
Maybe her son.

00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,414
TRENT (frightened):
It's him, Christine.

00:08:51,414 --> 00:08:52,414
It's Gauss.

00:08:52,414 --> 00:08:53,418
I've seen him.

00:08:53,418 --> 00:08:55,421
He's following you and Holly!

00:08:55,421 --> 00:08:57,778
I-I don't know what to do!

00:08:57,778 --> 00:09:00,080
He's going to kill us all,
just like Dad said!

00:09:02,418 --> 00:09:04,051
I'm gonna give you some
temporary stitches

00:09:04,051 --> 00:09:06,153
in a little bit,

00:09:06,153 --> 00:09:08,755
but they won't hold long,
so I would advise you

00:09:08,755 --> 00:09:11,413
to get an X-ray
and some antibiotics.

00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:14,261
Rylan Gauss is a federal case.

00:09:14,261 --> 00:09:16,129
I don't know anything about it.

00:09:16,129 --> 00:09:17,413
What can you tell
me about him?

00:09:17,413 --> 00:09:18,420
He's a serial pedophile.

00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,416
He steals the little girls
right out of their beds.

00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:22,269
The mother intervened
on the last one.

00:09:22,269 --> 00:09:23,420
Gauss shot her
in the eye.

00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,172
Ah, just like, uh...

00:09:25,172 --> 00:09:27,415
Yeah.
...your wife.

00:09:27,415 --> 00:09:29,209
I chased him
for ten years.

00:09:29,209 --> 00:09:30,420
Six little girls.

00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,145
I never found any of them.

00:09:32,145 --> 00:09:33,947
Nothing to link him
to any of the crimes.

00:09:33,947 --> 00:09:36,249
I was able to nail him for the
murder of the mother, though.

00:09:36,249 --> 00:09:37,317
25-to-life.

00:09:37,317 --> 00:09:38,351
How'd the guy get
out of prison?

00:09:38,351 --> 00:09:40,720
52 days ago,

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,055
the conviction
was overturned.

00:09:42,055 --> 00:09:44,157
The appeals court tossed out
the lead batch analysis

00:09:44,157 --> 00:09:46,326
that the Bureau used to

00:09:46,326 --> 00:09:48,929
link the murder bullet
to Gauss' live ammo.

00:09:48,929 --> 00:09:50,864
Has he contacted you
or threatened you?

00:09:50,864 --> 00:09:52,165
Me and my family.

00:09:52,165 --> 00:09:53,300
Given his M.O.,

00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,301
my daughter doesn't
have much time.

00:09:54,301 --> 00:09:55,302
And I don't even
want to think...

00:09:55,302 --> 00:09:56,421
All right,
enough already, okay?

00:09:56,421 --> 00:09:58,038
We're done.
Okay, take
it easy.

00:09:58,038 --> 00:09:59,419
Thanks a lot, Doc.
Yeah.

00:09:59,419 --> 00:10:02,309
Is there anyone else that
Gauss, uh, may be after?

00:10:02,309 --> 00:10:04,978
I have a son
from my first marriage.

00:10:04,978 --> 00:10:06,179
What's his name?

00:10:06,179 --> 00:10:08,115
Trent.

00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:14,254
Hey, Trent, it's Dad.

00:10:14,254 --> 00:10:15,789
You call me back immediately.

00:10:17,413 --> 00:10:19,192
Katie, it's Mr. Moore.

00:10:19,192 --> 00:10:20,421
Could I speak
with Trent, please?

00:10:20,421 --> 00:10:23,420
You sure he's not out
on a delivery or...?

00:10:24,865 --> 00:10:27,414
No, when you see him,
you make him call me.

00:10:27,414 --> 00:10:30,337
No, it's an emergency.

00:10:30,337 --> 00:10:32,005
Trent didn't show up
to work today.

00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,375
It's not like him.

00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:37,010
Let's go.

00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:39,413
(sirens whooping)

00:10:44,418 --> 00:10:45,752
Trent?!

00:10:45,752 --> 00:10:46,753
Las Vegas Police!

00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:52,993
Trent?!

00:10:54,027 --> 00:10:55,162
Trent?

00:10:56,329 --> 00:10:59,232
Trent?

00:11:02,035 --> 00:11:03,417
He has Trent.

00:11:03,417 --> 00:11:05,005
If Gauss was here,

00:11:05,005 --> 00:11:06,418
he would've shot you
coming through the door.

00:11:06,418 --> 00:11:07,908
You got to ratchet it
down a notch,

00:11:07,908 --> 00:11:09,042
okay?

00:11:11,745 --> 00:11:15,982
Control, this is Brass. I need
an APB out on Rylan Gauss,

00:11:15,982 --> 00:11:17,050
white male in his 30s,

00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:18,318
armed and dangerous.

00:11:18,318 --> 00:11:20,353
Bastard's got my whole family.

00:11:28,762 --> 00:11:30,764
(gun cocks)

00:11:36,421 --> 00:11:38,421
Ready?

00:11:38,421 --> 00:11:40,974
Rylan Gauss, Vegas PD!
We got a warrant!

00:11:56,412 --> 00:11:58,415
It's all clear.

00:11:58,415 --> 00:11:59,893
We'll take it
from here, boys.

00:11:59,893 --> 00:12:01,161
Thank you.

00:12:05,165 --> 00:12:07,033
If I was Gauss, out for revenge,

00:12:07,033 --> 00:12:08,935
I'd kill Agent Moore's wife
and his teenage son.

00:12:08,935 --> 00:12:11,738
And take the little girl,
'cause I get off on it.

00:12:11,738 --> 00:12:12,906
Yeah.

00:12:12,906 --> 00:12:14,908
Check the bed.

00:12:21,881 --> 00:12:24,884
Nothing but porno mags.

00:12:24,884 --> 00:12:26,753
Where else could he hide her?

00:12:26,753 --> 00:12:28,722
Let's tear the place apart.

00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:36,162
SIDLE:
Looks like the point of entry.

00:12:36,162 --> 00:12:38,331
There's some granular trace
on the sill.

00:12:38,331 --> 00:12:40,419
It's corn starch.

00:12:40,419 --> 00:12:42,414
From cheap latex gloves.
That's Gauss' M.O.

00:12:42,414 --> 00:12:43,737
He always wears them.

00:12:43,737 --> 00:12:45,418
Guy comes in through the
window, he jimmies it open

00:12:45,418 --> 00:12:47,413
with a chisel-- that's what
that mark is, right there.

00:12:47,413 --> 00:12:48,942
Agent Moore,
with all due respect,

00:12:48,942 --> 00:12:51,417
you need to back off
and let me do my job.

00:12:55,417 --> 00:12:58,218
You're... overlaying
my shoe impressions.

00:12:58,218 --> 00:13:00,954
It's not going to be that
hard to distinguish, okay?

00:13:00,954 --> 00:13:03,290
Gauss wears a size 10,
Nosumi soles.

00:13:05,025 --> 00:13:07,160
Agent Moore?

00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,295
You are contaminating
my crime scene.

00:13:08,295 --> 00:13:10,130
Hey, buddy.
We get it, okay?

00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:12,165
The crime scene investigator
is a professional.

00:13:12,165 --> 00:13:13,166
She's working as fast
as she can, all right?

00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:15,417
Well, I've seen it
too many times, okay?

00:13:15,417 --> 00:13:17,304
Cop-fast turns
into hostage-late.

00:13:17,304 --> 00:13:19,419
Hey, hey, back off!
All right? Back off.

00:13:19,419 --> 00:13:22,008
I'll take care of
Gauss myself, then.

00:13:22,008 --> 00:13:23,343
BRASS:
Let him go, Mitch.

00:13:23,343 --> 00:13:25,278
Go ahead, get out of here.

00:13:35,955 --> 00:13:37,416
Looks like we got a pill dump.

00:13:43,413 --> 00:13:44,998
People don't usually
throw away narcotics

00:13:44,998 --> 00:13:46,419
unless they have to.

00:13:46,419 --> 00:13:48,419
Olanzapine and aripiprazole.

00:13:48,419 --> 00:13:50,420
Trent Moore was on meds,
antidepressants.

00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,838
Hmm.

00:13:51,838 --> 00:13:53,414
So Rylan Gauss flushed them?

00:13:53,414 --> 00:13:55,008
It's a good way
to control a hostage.

00:13:55,008 --> 00:13:56,976
He could've kept a few,

00:13:56,976 --> 00:13:58,420
used them to force
the kid's cooperation.

00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,747
That's assuming that
Trent Moore is still alive.

00:14:04,184 --> 00:14:06,052
The agent who delivered
these files said that

00:14:06,052 --> 00:14:10,123
Daniel Moore is the FBI's
top pedophile hunter.

00:14:10,123 --> 00:14:13,093
Ironic-- his own kids
get snatched.

00:14:13,093 --> 00:14:15,829
Yeah, well, not so ironic if one
of the guys he's been chasing

00:14:15,829 --> 00:14:18,098
decided to turn the tables
on him.

00:14:18,098 --> 00:14:22,102
All right, the offender profile
says that Rylan Gauss

00:14:22,102 --> 00:14:24,003
started in his early 20s,

00:14:24,003 --> 00:14:27,841
followed a typical escalation
pattern-- indecent exposure,

00:14:27,841 --> 00:14:29,414
couple of burglary charges.

00:14:29,414 --> 00:14:31,420
HODGES:
Social Services investigated

00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,113
an incident involving
a female cousin.

00:14:33,113 --> 00:14:34,419
Four years old.

00:14:34,419 --> 00:14:36,950
Gauss' parents
wouldn't cooperate.

00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:40,412
I hate it when the families
protect these guys.

00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:41,988
All right, well,
let's look for anything

00:14:41,988 --> 00:14:43,923
about how long he usually
kept the girls,

00:14:43,923 --> 00:14:46,760
or where he might
have taken them.

00:14:49,963 --> 00:14:53,133
Hey, Nicky.

00:14:53,133 --> 00:14:54,934
I got something.

00:14:58,413 --> 00:14:59,806
It's a, uh...

00:14:59,806 --> 00:15:02,976
clothes hanger made into
some kind of a tool.

00:15:02,976 --> 00:15:06,012
Maybe for fishing something
out of a tight space?

00:15:11,415 --> 00:15:12,752
Let me see that thing.

00:15:23,329 --> 00:15:25,419
Yeah, there's something
behind this panel.

00:15:26,866 --> 00:15:28,419
If it's kiddy porn, we got him.

00:15:43,049 --> 00:15:44,414
<i>An Elephant Named Herman.</i>

00:15:44,414 --> 00:15:45,885
<i>My Puppy Dog Tale,</i>

00:15:45,885 --> 00:15:48,416
<i>Kitty Cat Clues?</i>

00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:49,823
Children's read-aloud books.

00:15:51,157 --> 00:15:52,292
They never caught Gauss

00:15:52,292 --> 00:15:53,793
with any evidence
from his victims.

00:15:53,793 --> 00:15:55,829
Personal items belonging
to the missing girls

00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:58,097
disappeared just prior
to their abductions,

00:15:58,097 --> 00:15:59,420
including children's books.

00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,968
The items disappeared
while the victims

00:16:01,968 --> 00:16:04,838
were playing in the park.

00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:07,841
Gauss selects his victims
from local parks.

00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:09,414
That's where he does
his shopping.

00:16:09,414 --> 00:16:11,417
<i>The Animal Fair.</i>

00:16:11,417 --> 00:16:13,279
He didn't just go out
and buy these.

00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,714
Looks like they got
some years on 'em.

00:16:14,714 --> 00:16:16,414
Maybe the belonged
to the victims.

00:16:16,414 --> 00:16:18,218
They could be trophies.

00:16:18,218 --> 00:16:19,419
Print 'em.

00:16:19,419 --> 00:16:21,417
(phone rings)

00:16:21,417 --> 00:16:23,356
This is Catherine.

00:16:23,356 --> 00:16:25,419
Is there a park
near your location?

00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:26,893
Yeah, we passed one

00:16:26,893 --> 00:16:28,417
as we were driving
into the neighborhood. Why?

00:16:28,417 --> 00:16:29,929
Gauss doesn't keep
his victims long.

00:16:29,929 --> 00:16:33,833
And when he's done, he goes back
out hunting in parks.

00:16:56,189 --> 00:16:58,258
There he is right there.

00:17:05,298 --> 00:17:08,414
What the hell is
Agent Moore doing here?

00:17:08,414 --> 00:17:09,414
Gun!

00:17:09,414 --> 00:17:11,104
WILLOWS:
Agent Moore, put your gun down!

00:17:11,104 --> 00:17:12,417
(gun cocks)

00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,976
WILLOWS:
Stand down!

00:17:17,777 --> 00:17:19,812
GAUSS (grunting):
Get off me.

00:17:19,812 --> 00:17:21,247
Where is she?!
Where's who?

00:17:21,247 --> 00:17:23,783
Where's Holly Moore?
I don't even know who that is!

00:17:23,783 --> 00:17:25,184
Fine. You're under arrest.

00:17:25,184 --> 00:17:27,921
GAUSS:
Let go of me.

00:17:32,292 --> 00:17:34,413
(kids laughing,
shouting on video)

00:17:43,419 --> 00:17:45,138
What's that about?

00:17:45,138 --> 00:17:47,140
It's not illegal
to make a video.

00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,413
That-that's a cute little girl.

00:17:49,413 --> 00:17:52,378
I wish I had one just like her.

00:17:52,378 --> 00:17:55,420
What were you doing
in the park, Rylan?

00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,350
On a play date?

00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:59,319
After you were done
with Holly Moore?

00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:01,354
I spent five years
in prison.

00:18:01,354 --> 00:18:03,723
I like parks,
open spaces.

00:18:03,723 --> 00:18:05,024
I like to look at pretty things.

00:18:05,024 --> 00:18:06,421
Where's Holly Moore?

00:18:06,421 --> 00:18:09,996
Is that any relation
to a Daniel Moore?

00:18:09,996 --> 00:18:12,031
Come on. You know it is.
You threatened her whole family.

00:18:16,421 --> 00:18:18,417
Oh, did you lose that sweet

00:18:18,417 --> 00:18:20,420
(over intercom):
little girl of yours, Daniel?

00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:23,343
I'm sorry.

00:18:23,343 --> 00:18:26,045
Oh, but you have two children,

00:18:26,045 --> 00:18:28,881
so you still have one left,
right?

00:18:28,881 --> 00:18:30,412
BRASS:
Yeah, right.

00:18:30,412 --> 00:18:32,285
Let's talk about Trent Moore.

00:18:32,285 --> 00:18:34,412
He certainly had a lot
to say about you.

00:18:34,412 --> 00:18:35,414
TRENT (recording):
It's him, Christine.

00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:36,990
It's Gauss. I've seen him.

00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,058
He's following you and Holly!

00:18:39,058 --> 00:18:40,827
I don't know what to do!

00:18:40,827 --> 00:18:44,197
He-he's going to kill us all,
just like Dad said!

00:18:44,197 --> 00:18:45,231
No, no, no.

00:18:45,231 --> 00:18:46,418
No, that's a frame-up.

00:18:46,418 --> 00:18:48,935
I went to prison for a crime
I didn't commit.

00:18:48,935 --> 00:18:52,415
It didn't work the first time,
and he's trying to get me again.

00:18:52,415 --> 00:18:55,208
He accused me of being a psycho.
Me, a psycho?!

00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:57,076
The guy stalks me
my whole life!

00:18:57,076 --> 00:18:58,077
He's the sick one!

00:18:58,077 --> 00:18:59,212
You hear that, Daniel?!

00:18:59,212 --> 00:19:00,346
You're the sick one!

00:19:01,418 --> 00:19:02,782
So where were you last night?

00:19:02,782 --> 00:19:05,414
Oh, last night?
Yeah.

00:19:07,153 --> 00:19:08,788
Um, I was in a...

00:19:08,788 --> 00:19:11,324
a bar, the Red Lamp,
off of Fremont.

00:19:11,324 --> 00:19:13,760
The bartender's name
was, um, Terry.

00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,863
Talked about how he needs
a new head gasket for his car.

00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:19,418
He'll remember the conversation.
You just have to ask him.

00:19:19,418 --> 00:19:22,412
Feel pretty good
about that, huh?

00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:23,936
What do you think?

00:19:23,936 --> 00:19:26,839
You're just gonna waltz out
of here, whistling a tune?

From Cordon's Ranch Market,

Christine Moore must have

00:20:45,084 --> 00:20:46,416
I don't know any
three-year-olds,

00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:47,887
but I do know that

00:20:47,887 --> 00:20:49,722
if Christine didn't eat it,
and Holly didn't eat it,

00:20:49,722 --> 00:20:52,091

The books we found in Gauss's
apartment had no prints.

00:22:21,814 --> 00:22:23,420
They're in no way a connection
to any of these missing girls.

00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:25,416
You gotta be

No, sir, I'm not.

All we found were traces of

Yeah. Because Gauss
wears latex gloves.

00:22:29,255 --> 00:22:31,414
He sits there torturing

00:22:31,414 --> 00:22:33,419
while he's reading to them
from their own favorite books.

00:22:34,413 --> 00:22:35,928
I advise you not to leave town.

00:22:35,928 --> 00:22:38,231

Oh, hey.

Uh, I hope your kids
are all right, there, Danny.

00:22:53,421 --> 00:22:54,714
You know,

00:22:54,714 --> 00:22:57,049
all that time wasted on me.

00:22:57,049 --> 00:22:59,051

to blame.

Only yourself.

00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:04,421
You're just going to let him go?

00:23:04,421 --> 00:23:06,092
If we do anything now,
it'll only come back

00:23:06,092 --> 00:23:07,793
to hurt us when we
do try to nail him.

00:23:07,793 --> 00:23:09,414
When is that going to be?

00:23:09,414 --> 00:23:12,031
Jim! He just as much admitted
that my kids are dead.

00:23:12,031 --> 00:23:14,300
Hey, when I put him in prison,
he's gonna stay there!

00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,269
Not going to get out
on some technicality.

00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:18,004
And by the way, his alibi
checks out, you know.

00:23:18,004 --> 00:23:19,372
Not only with the bartender,

00:23:19,372 --> 00:23:22,775
but several patrons who he
was drinking with all night.

00:23:22,775 --> 00:23:25,311
Rylan Gauss didn't
kill your wife!

00:23:25,311 --> 00:23:26,913
He was in a bar.

00:23:26,913 --> 00:23:28,981
MOORE:
Gauss is the only angle.
You heard Trent's voice mail.

00:23:28,981 --> 00:23:30,216
Gauss is stalking my family,

00:23:30,216 --> 00:23:31,784
and now you're just going
to let him go.

00:23:31,784 --> 00:23:33,414
Hey, file a complaint.
I'll have him arrested.

00:23:33,414 --> 00:23:36,419
Are we on the same side
here anymore?

00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:40,159
(sighs, groans)

00:23:41,412 --> 00:23:44,297
Is it just me, or does he
not seem that broken up

00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:45,415
about his dead wife?

00:23:45,415 --> 00:23:46,417
It's his focus;
it's all about Gauss,

00:23:46,417 --> 00:23:48,100
even when the evidence
points away from him.

00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:51,103
You know, Nicky, I've known a
lot of guys like Daniel Moore.

00:23:51,103 --> 00:23:55,007
When things go bad, both
professionally or personally,

00:23:55,007 --> 00:23:57,413
it's always the bastard
that got away.

00:23:57,413 --> 00:24:01,419
And Rylan Gauss makes
one hell of a boogeyman.

00:24:05,751 --> 00:24:07,415
Hey, Catherine.

00:24:07,415 --> 00:24:10,723
I just got off the phone
with Christine Moore's sister.

00:24:10,723 --> 00:24:12,412
She called to arrange
release of the body

00:24:12,412 --> 00:24:14,026
to a mortuary in Wichita.

00:24:14,026 --> 00:24:16,417
Isn't that usually
up to the spouse?

00:24:16,417 --> 00:24:19,098
Unless the spouses are in
the middle of an ugly divorce.

00:24:19,098 --> 00:24:20,833
Did Agent Moore mention that?

00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:23,769
No, he left that out.

00:24:23,769 --> 00:24:25,104
Yeah, that's what I figured.

00:24:25,104 --> 00:24:27,413
So I gave her my best Quincy,

00:24:27,413 --> 00:24:29,909
and she was more than happy
to rat out her brother-in-law.

00:24:29,909 --> 00:24:33,420
Christine was asking for sole
custody of her daughter,

00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:35,314
and filing for guardianship
of her stepson.

00:24:35,314 --> 00:24:37,950
Guardianship?

00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:40,186
Trent's 18.
He's been living on his own.

00:24:40,186 --> 00:24:41,754
Christine was going
to court to prove

00:24:41,754 --> 00:24:43,421
that Moore was
an unfit father.

00:24:43,421 --> 00:24:46,359
According to her sister,
the plan was

00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:48,928
to move both kids
back to Kansas.

00:24:48,928 --> 00:24:50,997
Okay, well...

00:24:50,997 --> 00:24:52,865
If Daniel Moore weren't FBI,

00:24:52,865 --> 00:24:55,134
we'd be looking at him
for the murder of his wife.

00:24:56,869 --> 00:25:00,740
Jim? I need you to verify
the alibi for Daniel Moore.

00:25:02,975 --> 00:25:04,419
AKERS:
<i>Good call, Cap.</i>

00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:06,912
Agent Moore's car is
parked around back.

00:25:06,912 --> 00:25:08,418
It's still warm.

00:25:08,418 --> 00:25:11,416
Rylan Gauss's apartment is the
last place this guy should be.

00:25:14,086 --> 00:25:15,921
Let's hope he didn't
do anything stupid.

00:25:21,727 --> 00:25:22,728
Drop it.

00:25:22,728 --> 00:25:25,264
Now!

00:25:32,338 --> 00:25:33,420
My gun hasn't been fired.

00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:34,421
You can check it.

00:25:39,078 --> 00:25:40,746
I want your backup piece.

00:25:40,746 --> 00:25:42,715
It's in the small of my back.
I'm reaching now.

00:25:42,715 --> 00:25:44,183
Two fingers.

00:25:48,413 --> 00:25:50,419
Son of a bitch was down
when I got here.

00:25:50,419 --> 00:25:52,892
Not that I didn't come here
looking to kneecap him.

00:25:52,892 --> 00:25:54,414
Torture him until he told me

00:25:54,414 --> 00:25:56,796
where my kids are.

00:25:56,796 --> 00:25:58,414
But unfortunately,
someone beat me to it.

00:25:58,414 --> 00:26:00,066
Yeah, right.

00:26:00,066 --> 00:26:02,134
Let's go.

00:26:02,134 --> 00:26:06,172
ANDREWS:
The pills you collected from
Trent Moore's bathroom floor

00:26:06,172 --> 00:26:08,412
are antidepressants, but they're
also used in combination

00:26:08,412 --> 00:26:10,376
to treat emerging schizophrenia.

00:26:10,376 --> 00:26:12,111
Do we know if the kid had
any psychological problems?

00:26:12,111 --> 00:26:14,419
No, we don't. He was living
alone, holding down a job.

00:26:14,419 --> 00:26:17,216
Not atypical.

00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:19,421
When the disease becomes
full-blown in adulthood,

00:26:19,421 --> 00:26:21,053
medications ramp up in
proportion to the increase

00:26:21,053 --> 00:26:23,856
in delusions and paranoia.

00:26:23,856 --> 00:26:27,415
Agent Moore never mentioned
that his son is schizophrenic.

00:26:27,415 --> 00:26:29,415
He's got a bad habit
of leaving things out.

00:26:29,415 --> 00:26:32,164
I know we think Gauss killed
Trent, but if he didn't,

00:26:32,164 --> 00:26:34,415
and Trent's been off his meds
for the past 24 hours,

00:26:34,415 --> 00:26:36,302
then there's a
good probability

00:26:36,302 --> 00:26:38,418
he's in the middle of a
full-blown psychotic episode.

00:26:38,418 --> 00:26:40,773
Sandwich wrapper.

00:26:40,773 --> 00:26:42,741
Trent likes egg salad.

00:26:42,741 --> 00:26:45,177
Which puts him in the van,

00:26:45,177 --> 00:26:46,421
when Christine and Holly
came out of the supermarket.

00:26:46,421 --> 00:26:48,247
He was probably there
the whole time.

00:26:48,247 --> 00:26:49,915
Question is,

00:26:49,915 --> 00:26:51,183
what was he doing in the minivan

00:26:51,183 --> 00:26:52,818
with Christine and Holly,
at 4:00 a.m.?

00:26:52,818 --> 00:26:55,788
Whatever the reason,
he witnessed the shooting.

00:26:55,788 --> 00:26:59,125
PHILLIPS:
Three GSWs to the torso.

00:26:59,125 --> 00:27:00,326
Small caliber.

00:27:00,326 --> 00:27:02,328
Same as the supermarket.

00:27:02,328 --> 00:27:06,413
Well, if Agent Moore shot Gauss,
did he also shoot his wife?

00:27:06,413 --> 00:27:08,734
PHILLIPS: They were going
through a nasty divorce.

00:27:08,734 --> 00:27:11,770
Position of the body suggests
he was hit as he entered.

00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:14,740
Agent Moore must've
been lying in wait.

00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,742
But how? Where's the .22?

00:27:16,742 --> 00:27:19,378
We didn't find it on him.

00:27:19,378 --> 00:27:21,213
So why ditch a throw-away,
and then come back

00:27:21,213 --> 00:27:25,718
and stand over the body with
your service weapon out?

00:27:34,894 --> 00:27:36,862
Fast First Deliveries.

00:27:36,862 --> 00:27:39,198
Agent Moore's son
works for a messenger service.

00:27:39,198 --> 00:27:40,900
That wasn't here before.

00:27:43,418 --> 00:27:47,421
74% of children who are abducted
are dead within three hours.

00:27:47,421 --> 00:27:49,413
It's been 24.

00:27:49,413 --> 00:27:51,911
So the longer we sit here
talking about what I didn't do,

00:27:51,911 --> 00:27:54,213
the less chance I have
of ever seeing them again.

00:27:54,213 --> 00:27:56,421
I know the numbers, all right?
I want to talk about Trent.

00:27:56,421 --> 00:27:58,317
Your son is a
clinically diagnosed

00:27:58,317 --> 00:27:59,985
paranoid schizophrenic.

00:27:59,985 --> 00:28:02,415
My son, Trent, is fine.
He's just fine.

00:28:02,415 --> 00:28:03,822
What are you talking about?

00:28:03,822 --> 00:28:05,758
We found psychotropic
meds in his apartment.

00:28:05,758 --> 00:28:07,826
Now, clearly, he's under
psychiatric treatment.

00:28:07,826 --> 00:28:09,061
The meds just make you crazy.

00:28:09,061 --> 00:28:10,763
I told Christine
he didn't need to take them.

00:28:10,763 --> 00:28:12,064
Oh, and this is based on what,

00:28:12,064 --> 00:28:13,132
your experience
as a psychoanalyst?

00:28:13,132 --> 00:28:14,420
Don't push that angle on me.

00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,001
You know the job.

00:28:16,001 --> 00:28:19,415
We hunt down these scum
who torture and rape children.

00:28:19,415 --> 00:28:20,940
And you just got to suck it up.

00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,374
'Cause there's no little pill

00:28:22,374 --> 00:28:24,243
that's just going to make
this world a better place.

00:28:24,243 --> 00:28:26,946
You know, your behavior has
been erratic since I met you.

00:28:26,946 --> 00:28:28,417
They say that mental illness
runs in families.

00:28:28,417 --> 00:28:30,182
Okay, come on, here it comes:

00:28:30,182 --> 00:28:33,085
Everybody drinks the Kool-Aid,
now-- Christine, you,

00:28:33,085 --> 00:28:34,954
$200 shrinks.
Well, not me.

00:28:34,954 --> 00:28:37,089
And not my son.
We're the crazy people now?

00:28:37,089 --> 00:28:41,093
My son and I are crazy,
while Rylan Gauss is sane?

00:28:41,093 --> 00:28:42,418
Go to hell.

00:28:42,418 --> 00:28:43,963
Gauss is dead.

00:28:43,963 --> 00:28:45,413
You want to know
what's really crazy?

00:28:45,413 --> 00:28:47,413
We have evidence that Trent
was in Gauss's apartment.

00:28:47,413 --> 00:28:49,134
Now, does your
son have access

00:28:49,134 --> 00:28:52,338
to a small-caliber firearm,
specifically, a .22?

00:28:53,414 --> 00:28:56,413
Gauss was killed with a .22?

00:28:56,413 --> 00:28:58,143
As was Christine,
as was the bagger.

00:28:58,143 --> 00:29:00,012
Now, we're pulling slugs
from the autopsy right now,

00:29:00,012 --> 00:29:01,914
and I think we're going
to get a match.

00:29:01,914 --> 00:29:04,413
Trent was with Christine,
in the minivan,

00:29:04,413 --> 00:29:06,719
at the grocery store, at
the time of the shooting.

00:29:06,719 --> 00:29:08,087
Now, what is Trent's
relationship with

00:29:08,087 --> 00:29:09,188
his little sister Holly?

00:29:09,188 --> 00:29:11,056
I refuse to believe this--
any of it!

00:29:11,056 --> 00:29:12,412
Well, let me tell you
what I believe, okay?

00:29:13,859 --> 00:29:15,861
Trent was not kidnapped.

00:29:15,861 --> 00:29:17,329
He stopped taking his meds.

00:29:17,329 --> 00:29:18,415
He's having a
psychotic episode.

00:29:18,415 --> 00:29:19,421
He killed Gauss.

00:29:19,421 --> 00:29:21,413
And as hard as this is to say,

00:29:21,413 --> 00:29:23,269
I think he killed Christine.

00:29:23,269 --> 00:29:25,004
Now the question is,

00:29:25,004 --> 00:29:26,872
would he harm
his little sister Holly?

00:29:26,872 --> 00:29:30,209
He loves Holly.

00:29:30,209 --> 00:29:34,146
If Trent had Holly,
where would he take her?

00:29:37,421 --> 00:29:40,219
My first wife died of cancer
when Trent was ten.

00:29:40,219 --> 00:29:41,920
They were very close.

00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:45,418
Sometimes, he just likes
to go back to the old house.

00:29:45,418 --> 00:29:47,420
Where's the old house?

00:29:52,097 --> 00:29:53,198
House is gone.

00:29:53,198 --> 00:29:55,067
Now what?

00:29:55,067 --> 00:29:57,269
SIDLE:
Well, there's a shed over there.

00:29:57,269 --> 00:29:59,416
Roof over his head,
place to keep Holly warm,

00:29:59,416 --> 00:30:01,173
a place to think.

00:30:01,173 --> 00:30:02,374
This is it.

00:30:13,085 --> 00:30:14,416
(whimpering)

00:30:14,416 --> 00:30:16,416
I hear something.

00:30:21,417 --> 00:30:23,896
(quietly):
I'd like to talk to him.

00:30:23,896 --> 00:30:26,165
He's more comfortable
with women.

00:30:26,165 --> 00:30:28,367
Okay.
I'll cover you.

00:30:28,367 --> 00:30:29,868
Trent?

00:30:29,868 --> 00:30:31,870
Are you in there?

00:30:33,372 --> 00:30:36,420
My name is Sara.
I'm here to help you.

00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:39,912
Where's Holly?
Is she okay?

00:30:43,982 --> 00:30:45,420
Are you alone?

00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,186
(sobbing)

00:30:51,415 --> 00:30:53,415
Trent?

00:30:55,094 --> 00:30:57,417
We've been looking for you
and your sister.

00:30:59,331 --> 00:31:01,420
It's okay.

00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:03,412
You're safe now, you
can put the gun down.

00:31:03,412 --> 00:31:08,240
Rylan Gauss. Rylan Gauss did it.

00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,744
He has my baby sister.

00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:12,745
He killed Christine.

00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:14,113
Okay.

00:31:15,314 --> 00:31:18,083
Rylan Gauss
can't hurt you anymore.

00:31:18,083 --> 00:31:19,785
Dad was right.

00:31:19,785 --> 00:31:21,754
He's always right.

00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:24,757
Have to always, always watch
for Rylan Gauss.

00:31:26,825 --> 00:31:28,827
Did you used to play here,
in this shed?

00:31:28,827 --> 00:31:30,418
When you lived here
with your mother?

00:31:30,418 --> 00:31:33,413
(sobs)

00:31:33,413 --> 00:31:35,413
I know she loved
you, Trent.

00:31:35,413 --> 00:31:38,419
And she would want you
to put the gun down.

00:31:38,419 --> 00:31:40,413
If you hurt yourself,

00:31:40,413 --> 00:31:42,413
who's going to take
care of your sister?

00:31:42,413 --> 00:31:44,176
Rylan Gauss was there.

00:31:44,176 --> 00:31:45,744
I saw him.

00:31:45,744 --> 00:31:47,913
Where did he take her?

00:31:47,913 --> 00:31:49,915
He follows us.

00:31:49,915 --> 00:31:51,420
He talks to me.

00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:53,752
Gauss is dead.

00:31:53,752 --> 00:31:56,722
You know that.
No.

00:31:56,722 --> 00:31:58,824
He's me. I did it.

00:31:58,824 --> 00:32:02,361
I killed her! I'm Rylan Gauss,
I'm Rylan Gauss, ask my dad!

00:32:02,361 --> 00:32:04,062
Okay, okay, Rylan.

00:32:04,062 --> 00:32:05,419
Okay, listen, put the
gun down, all right?

00:32:05,419 --> 00:32:07,419
I kill little girls!

00:32:09,413 --> 00:32:12,414
He-he has their pictures,
ask my dad.

00:32:12,414 --> 00:32:13,972
Please, please, give
me the gun. Okay?

00:32:13,972 --> 00:32:15,974
It's okay.

00:32:15,974 --> 00:32:17,976
Give me the gun, Rylan.
Give it to me.

00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,816
(sobbing loudly)
It's okay. It's okay.

00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:25,317
It's okay.

00:32:29,721 --> 00:32:32,724
♪ ♪

00:32:56,412 --> 00:32:58,050
(knocks on door)

00:32:58,050 --> 00:33:00,052
Any info from Trent?

00:33:00,052 --> 00:33:02,413
No, no. Maybe when his meds
kick in,

00:33:02,413 --> 00:33:04,189
he'll tell us
where Holly is,

00:33:04,189 --> 00:33:05,891
but at the moment,
he's Mark David Chapman

00:33:05,891 --> 00:33:08,417
shooting John Lennon
thinking he's John Lennon.

00:33:08,417 --> 00:33:09,795
I hope it's not too late.

00:33:09,795 --> 00:33:11,415
Me, too.

00:33:11,415 --> 00:33:14,032
I believe we have
an infestation.

00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:21,373
Hmm,<i>Cimex lectularius,</i>
aka the common bedbug.

00:33:21,373 --> 00:33:23,008
Where did you find this?

00:33:23,008 --> 00:33:25,377
I processed the ball cap that
you found in Gauss's apartment.

00:33:25,377 --> 00:33:28,013
Hey, do you know
if Sara found

00:33:28,013 --> 00:33:29,415
any bedbugs
at Trent Moore's place?

00:33:29,415 --> 00:33:32,414
Negative. Nor did I
see bugs in the shed,

00:33:32,414 --> 00:33:34,414
but I did see bug
bites on Trent.

00:33:36,419 --> 00:33:40,413
But we didn't find any
in Gauss's apartment.

00:33:42,194 --> 00:33:43,962
Hey, are you sure
this didn't come

00:33:43,962 --> 00:33:45,414
from your house
there, itchy?

00:33:45,414 --> 00:33:46,899
No. My mother is very clean.

00:33:48,333 --> 00:33:51,418
Maybe Trent picked them up
wherever he has Holly stashed.

00:33:51,418 --> 00:33:53,305
Fire in the hole! Two shots!

00:34:26,171 --> 00:34:28,420
WILLOWS:<i>The bullets</i>
<i>that killed Rylan Gauss</i>

00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:31,043
<i>came from Trent Moore's .22.</i>

00:34:35,314 --> 00:34:37,783
(three gunshots, Gauss groans)

00:34:43,021 --> 00:34:45,123
Trent's gun does not match
the bullets

00:34:45,123 --> 00:34:47,420
that killed Christine Moore
or the bagger at the market.

00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,421
So there's another .22
in play?

00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:51,129
Any leads on the shooter?

00:34:51,129 --> 00:34:53,165
Trent told Sara it was Gauss.

00:34:53,165 --> 00:34:54,900
Well, Christine Moore was shot
in the eye

00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,368
at close range--
that's Gauss's M.O.

00:34:56,368 --> 00:34:58,412
But we know that Gauss
wasn't the shooter.

00:34:58,412 --> 00:34:59,838
So who else knew his M.O.?

00:34:59,838 --> 00:35:03,108
Maybe a disgruntled husband
going through a nasty divorce

00:35:03,108 --> 00:35:05,412
who's hunting a serial pedophile
for ten years

00:35:05,412 --> 00:35:07,419
and trying to put back in
prison for good.

00:35:07,419 --> 00:35:09,416
Maybe somebody like that.

00:35:09,416 --> 00:35:12,084
Thanks, Catherine.
I'll get back to you.

00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:16,413
Okay, so what happened?

00:35:16,413 --> 00:35:18,090
You and Christine
had an argument, huh?

00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:20,125
You were sitting around
watching, waiting.

00:35:20,125 --> 00:35:21,417
You watched her
pull out of the garage.

00:35:21,417 --> 00:35:22,861
She was leaving in
the middle of the night,

00:35:22,861 --> 00:35:24,029
she was leaving you,

00:35:24,029 --> 00:35:26,198
and she's taking
your kids with her.

00:35:26,198 --> 00:35:28,417
But what you didn't know
was Trent was in the car.

00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:30,419
Did Trent tell you
where Holly is?

00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:32,337
Trent doesn't even know
where he is.

00:35:32,337 --> 00:35:33,939
He doesn't even
know<i>whohe is.</i>

00:35:33,939 --> 00:35:37,042
Most of the time
he thinks he's Rylan Gauss.

00:35:37,042 --> 00:35:40,413
A parent's obsession
becomes a kid's delusion.

00:35:40,413 --> 00:35:42,748
Trent thinks Gauss
killed Christine.

00:35:42,748 --> 00:35:44,816
But you and I know different.

00:35:50,155 --> 00:35:53,025
I just wanted to give Trent
a normal life.

00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:55,227
And I wanted justice
for those girls.

00:35:55,227 --> 00:36:00,032
Somewhere in between, I just
ruined everything I ever loved.

00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:04,102
Look, you gotta be honest
with your kid.

00:36:04,102 --> 00:36:05,337
You gotta tell him
straight up

00:36:05,337 --> 00:36:08,006
what happened in
that grocery store parking lot,

00:36:08,006 --> 00:36:09,419
and maybe shock him
into reality,

00:36:09,419 --> 00:36:10,976
because little Holly's
three years old

00:36:10,976 --> 00:36:12,010
and she's out there alone

00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:14,012
and we don't have
much time.

00:36:14,012 --> 00:36:17,315
You and I both took an oath
to protect the innocent.

00:36:17,315 --> 00:36:18,415
Well, here's the time.

00:36:18,415 --> 00:36:20,318
You gotta confess
to your son.

00:36:20,318 --> 00:36:21,953
You gotta tell him

00:36:21,953 --> 00:36:24,419
that Rylan Gauss wasn't the only
bad guy in his life.

00:36:41,073 --> 00:36:42,274
(door shuts)

00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:03,415
I killed them:
your daughter, your wife!

00:37:04,796 --> 00:37:07,032
No, you didn't.

00:37:07,032 --> 00:37:08,333
You're Trent.

00:37:09,901 --> 00:37:11,803
You're my son.

00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:15,416
And you love Holly

00:37:15,416 --> 00:37:18,043
and you loved Christine.

00:37:20,145 --> 00:37:21,913
He broke into my apartment

00:37:21,913 --> 00:37:24,182
and told me he was
coming after them.

00:37:29,321 --> 00:37:32,891
<i>I fought him,</i>
<i>but I couldn't stop him.</i>

00:37:32,891 --> 00:37:34,413
MOORE:
<i>It's not real.</i>

00:37:34,413 --> 00:37:37,229
<i>It was you...</i>

00:37:37,229 --> 00:37:39,416
<i>thinking you were Rylan Gauss.</i>

00:37:42,901 --> 00:37:45,418
That's why I went
to Christine...

00:37:45,418 --> 00:37:46,738
to warn her.

00:37:46,738 --> 00:37:49,341
To-to save Holly.

00:37:49,341 --> 00:37:53,211
He killed them, Daddy, like
you always said he would.

00:37:53,211 --> 00:37:55,180
Trent, look at me.

00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:57,421
Where's your sister, hmm?

00:37:57,421 --> 00:37:59,751
'Cause I know you took her
someplace safe.

00:37:59,751 --> 00:38:02,220
Rylan Gauss took her.

00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:04,256
He took her.<i>Itook her.</i>
I took her.

00:38:04,256 --> 00:38:07,225
Trent, stop it!

00:38:07,225 --> 00:38:08,960
You are not Rylan Gauss.

00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,095
You are my son.

00:38:10,095 --> 00:38:11,930
Rylan Gauss, Rylan Gauss,
Rylan Gauss.

00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:14,413
Son, you killed Rylan!

00:38:14,413 --> 00:38:16,101
You did it!

00:38:16,101 --> 00:38:19,104
Rylan Gauss is dead.

00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:25,419
You were at the supermarket
with Holly...

00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:29,781
...and you saw<i>me.</i>

00:38:29,781 --> 00:38:31,716
Not Rylan Gauss, me.

00:38:33,415 --> 00:38:35,412
Daniel?

00:38:35,412 --> 00:38:37,413
(three gunshots)

00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:40,725
(gunshot)

00:38:46,412 --> 00:38:49,167
MOORE:
<i>I didn't know you were there.</i>

00:38:49,167 --> 00:38:52,304
<i>I wanted to put Gauss away</i>
<i>for good.</i>

00:38:52,304 --> 00:38:54,940
<i>I didn't want Christine</i>
<i>to take you away from me.</i>

00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:56,741
(gunshot)

00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:00,178
Now tell me...

00:39:00,178 --> 00:39:03,048
where's your sister?

00:39:03,048 --> 00:39:04,421
Where's Holly, hmm?

00:39:04,421 --> 00:39:07,414
I don't know.

00:39:07,414 --> 00:39:09,254
She's gone.

00:39:09,254 --> 00:39:11,790
She's gone. I-I lost her.

00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:13,024
(sobbing)

00:39:13,024 --> 00:39:15,420
I lost her!

00:39:23,419 --> 00:39:25,418
Well, we got
our confession.

00:39:25,418 --> 00:39:28,139
I'd rather we had
the little girl.

00:39:28,139 --> 00:39:29,416
STOKES: Archie looked
for surveillance

00:39:29,416 --> 00:39:30,419
in the supermarket
parking lot.

00:39:30,419 --> 00:39:32,419
Came up empty.
But?

00:39:32,419 --> 00:39:34,246
But he was able to catch

00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:35,421
Christine's minivan
on a traffic cam.

00:39:35,421 --> 00:39:37,417
Check it out.
Trent was driving the van.

00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:40,415
Traffic cam picked this up
ten minutes after the shooting.

00:39:40,415 --> 00:39:43,221
Trent turned north
off of Honolulu onto Glenwood.

00:39:43,221 --> 00:39:44,823
That van's really booking.

00:39:44,823 --> 00:39:46,414
So, after Christine was shot,
Trent panicked.

00:39:46,414 --> 00:39:48,026
Thought that Rylan Gauss
was after them.

00:39:48,026 --> 00:39:50,061
And he was trying
to protect his sister.

00:39:50,061 --> 00:39:52,063
Well, after he turned
onto Glenwood,

00:39:52,063 --> 00:39:54,132
he disappears off the radar.

00:39:54,132 --> 00:39:55,415
If he stashed her somewhere,

00:39:55,415 --> 00:39:57,416
I might be able
to get you an area.

00:39:57,416 --> 00:39:58,416
So he stopped

00:39:58,416 --> 00:39:59,421
somewhere in the 'hood.

00:39:59,421 --> 00:40:01,239
WILLOWS:
It's a good-sized area.

00:40:01,239 --> 00:40:02,420
Yeah, but he was running out
of gas.

00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:04,042
He was scared.

00:40:04,042 --> 00:40:05,419
He didn't have
a lot of money.

00:40:05,419 --> 00:40:06,978
He needed a safe
place for Holly

00:40:06,978 --> 00:40:08,414
so he could
go after Gauss.

00:40:08,414 --> 00:40:10,415
Maybe a motel.
Yeah, maybe one
with bedbugs.

00:40:11,349 --> 00:40:12,412
I'll call Environmental Health,

00:40:12,412 --> 00:40:13,852
check out the complaints

00:40:13,852 --> 00:40:16,420
at the motels in the area.

00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:18,417
No luck.
What do you got?

00:40:18,417 --> 00:40:19,724
The manager
recognized Trent,

00:40:19,724 --> 00:40:21,412
but he didn't recognize
the little girl.

00:40:21,412 --> 00:40:23,412
Room seven.

00:40:43,415 --> 00:40:45,421
Bedbugs.

00:40:49,417 --> 00:40:50,889
She was here.

00:40:50,889 --> 00:40:53,419
(girl crying in distance)

00:40:57,162 --> 00:40:59,364
Las Vegas Police.

00:40:59,364 --> 00:41:00,966
(speaks Spanish)

00:41:00,966 --> 00:41:02,417
STOKES:
Yes, yes, we are looking
for the little girl.

00:41:02,417 --> 00:41:03,935
The young man asked me

00:41:03,935 --> 00:41:05,337
to watch her for
a little while

00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:07,038
but he never
came back.
It's okay.
Come on out there.

00:41:07,038 --> 00:41:08,239
I didn't know what to do.
I took care of her.

00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:09,416
No, you did
the right thing.

00:41:09,416 --> 00:41:11,416
Hi, Holly.
My name is Jim.

00:41:11,416 --> 00:41:14,112
Boy, we've been looking
all over for you.

00:41:14,112 --> 00:41:16,715
Come on. I'm gonna take
you home. Come on.
