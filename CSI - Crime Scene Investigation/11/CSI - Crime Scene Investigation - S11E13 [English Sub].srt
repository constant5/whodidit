00:00:01,838 --> 00:00:03,847
(drums beating rapid,
complex rhythms)

00:00:21,842 --> 00:00:24,842
(drumming continues)

00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:39,406
(cell phone rings)

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,578
Gil? I'm here already.
Where are you?

00:00:44,578 --> 00:00:45,841
I'm still in Peru.

00:00:45,841 --> 00:00:47,414
Are you at the party?
Hold on, uh...

00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:49,616
Hold on, Gil. I can't hear you.

00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:52,720
Sounds like taiko drums in
the background.

00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,754
The deaf love the vibrations.

00:00:53,754 --> 00:00:55,841
they can feel them
on their skin.

00:00:55,841 --> 00:00:57,424
Wh-why are you still in Peru?

00:00:57,424 --> 00:00:58,625
Is everything okay?

00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:00,561
Found another mass grave.

00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:02,629
(static crackling):
Government asked me to stay.

00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:04,839
(static crackling):
...you there?
Gil? Gil!

00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:27,839
(drumming ends)
(applause, cheers)

00:01:27,839 --> 00:01:28,844
SIDLE:
Mrs. Grissom!

00:01:28,844 --> 00:01:30,842
Hi!

00:01:32,838 --> 00:01:35,295
Sara, I want you to meet
someone. Julia Holden...

00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:37,838
head of the department

00:01:37,838 --> 00:01:39,333
of deaf cultural studies.

00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:42,302
Nice to meet you,
Professor.

00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:44,846
Julia, please.

00:01:44,846 --> 00:01:48,275
My students don't even
call me Professor.

00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:49,510
Sara's Gil's wife.

00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:53,844
Oh, the otherMrs. Grissom.

00:01:53,844 --> 00:01:58,752
It's Sara Sidle.
She didn't take his name.

00:01:58,752 --> 00:02:01,321
Julia's been
like a daughter to me.

00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:03,290
I'm so proud of her.

00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,839
Published author,

00:02:04,839 --> 00:02:07,847
lecturer, foremost authority
on deaf culture

00:02:07,847 --> 00:02:09,696
in the country.
Hmm.

00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:11,565
Ladies!

00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:14,535
You look beautiful tonight!

00:02:14,535 --> 00:02:16,603
Have you met my
daughter-in-law, Sara?

00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:19,773
Hi. I'm Dr. Eric Lambert.

00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:22,309
I'm the director
of the Gilbert Foundation.

00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,844
Oh, so you're the one who gets
to choose the grant winner.

00:02:24,844 --> 00:02:27,147
Half a million dollars!

00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,842
And they're all
a good candidate.

00:02:29,842 --> 00:02:31,518
Julia runs
the selection committee,

00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:34,655
and she's very passionate
about the candidates.

00:02:37,846 --> 00:02:40,461
Sorry. I have a stack
of papers on my desk.

00:02:40,461 --> 00:02:41,462
I better get going.

00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,601
Bye.

00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:52,773
So, where's your son?

00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:56,343
Gil got stuck in Peru.
He's been doing

00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:57,544
some consulting work for the...

00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:59,313
government.
He's-he's not coming.

00:02:59,313 --> 00:03:01,838
Seems like my son's

00:03:01,838 --> 00:03:05,844
away from home a lot.

00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:09,723
(combo playing mellow jazz)

00:03:25,846 --> 00:03:29,143
(explosion thunders,
car alarms wailing)

00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:35,843
SIDLE:
Julia!

00:03:35,843 --> 00:03:38,485
SIDLE: Hey!
Get away from the car!

00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,422
No! Get back!

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,692
It's gonna blow!

00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:47,261
(Julia yelling)

00:03:47,261 --> 00:03:49,846
Julia, he-he's dead.
Lambert is dead.

00:03:49,846 --> 00:03:50,845
He's gone.
He's dead.
(sobbing)

00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:53,400
He's gone.

00:03:57,504 --> 00:03:59,406
You have to stay back!

Hey.
STOKES: Wait a minute.
You did something different.

00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,252
Oh, my goodness.
I almost didn't recognize you.

00:04:45,252 --> 00:04:47,721
Yeah, yeah. Did you get
a haircut or something?

00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:49,556
Please tell me...
Yes, we have
your work clothes.

00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:50,591
Here's your coveralls.

00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:51,758
Thank you.

00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:52,846
Here's a seat
for you.

00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:56,396
So who's the victim?

00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:58,665
Uh, Dr. Eric Lambert.

00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:00,767
He's the director of
the Gilbert Foundation.

00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:01,842
I met him at the party.

00:05:01,842 --> 00:05:03,840
STOKES:
Black-tie event.

00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,506
Was it an open bar?
You know, he did
have a drink in his hand.

00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:08,175
LANGSTON:
Possible drunk driver.

00:05:08,175 --> 00:05:09,841
Hit the streetlight;
car exploded.

00:05:09,841 --> 00:05:12,145
Were you
the first one to respond?

00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,147
Uh... no.

00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,282
Actually, she was.

00:05:15,282 --> 00:05:17,451
Uh, going to try
and go talk to her.

00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:19,219
My signing's pretty terrible.

00:05:20,847 --> 00:05:22,756
We'll, uh, we'll check
out the vehicle.

00:05:26,845 --> 00:05:31,698
Um... I need to ask
you some questions.

00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:32,699
Is that all right?

00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,436
Did you see what happened?

00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:42,845
Wait...

00:05:42,845 --> 00:05:44,478
Wait, wait, wait.

00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:45,838
I-I-I don't understand.

00:05:45,838 --> 00:05:47,838
It's too fast.

00:05:47,838 --> 00:05:51,251
Excuse me, excuse me--
you were at the party?

00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:52,219
Uh, yes.
Dennis Palmer.

00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:53,353
Could you
interpret for me?

00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,421
Sure, sure.

00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:58,844
SIDLE:
Julia, what exactly

00:05:58,844 --> 00:06:00,727
did you see?

00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:04,464
I was in my office,

00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,839
when I felt the explosion.

00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:08,602
You felt it?

00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:11,738
The vibrations.

00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:13,407
<i>My windows rattled. So I got up</i>

00:06:13,407 --> 00:06:14,708
<i>to see what was happening.</i>

00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:15,846
<i>That's</i>when I saw the fire.

00:06:15,846 --> 00:06:21,181
I ran from my office
as fast as I could.

00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:23,784
That's when I saw
it was Dr. Lambert.

00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:26,553
I wish I could have
saved him.

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,758
(siren whoops)

00:06:34,361 --> 00:06:36,430
Reminds me of my first case.

00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,398
Except you're not wearing
a tie this time.

00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,847
Gonna be hard
to burrito him like that.

00:06:39,847 --> 00:06:42,202
I could put him in
the passenger seat of the van.

00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:43,737
Then we could use
the carpool lane.

00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:46,406
Always looking for the
silver lining, eh, David?

00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,841
Yeah. That's me.

00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:49,838
Okay, guys. Come on.

00:06:51,378 --> 00:06:55,415
Two things make a car go boom--
ruptured gas tank and a spark.

00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,351
LANGSTON: Rough terrain.
Sliding down this hill,

00:06:57,351 --> 00:06:59,553
there's a lot of things that
could have ruptured the tank.

00:06:59,553 --> 00:07:00,846
Yeah, and metal dragging
over the rocks,

00:07:00,846 --> 00:07:02,841
could have caused
a spark.
If it was anywhere

00:07:02,841 --> 00:07:03,847
near the tank.

00:07:03,847 --> 00:07:08,195
Puncture, spark, boom.

00:07:08,195 --> 00:07:11,765
We're in a ravine at the
edge of campus, yet

00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:14,201
all the witnesses say that
they felt the explosion.

00:07:14,201 --> 00:07:16,603
But if the car
blew up down here,

00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:18,739
the shock waves
would've been...

00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:20,440
absorbed by the hill, right?

00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,580
No skid marks.

00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,382
Means the driver didn't
pump the brakes

00:07:28,382 --> 00:07:29,847
or turn the wheel at all.

00:07:29,847 --> 00:07:31,184
Looks like he went
clean over.

00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:32,452
Mm-hmm.

00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:35,839
(inhales)

00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:36,842
That's gasoline.

00:07:38,425 --> 00:07:40,694
You know, I don't think
this explosion happened

00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:41,840
down in the ravine.

00:07:43,841 --> 00:07:45,839
There's a debris trail here.

00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:47,634
Yeah, here we go.

00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,638
Got something here.

00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,247
This looks like
a detonator, Ray.

00:08:00,247 --> 00:08:02,315
I think I have
another piece of it here, Nick.

00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:08,555
Lambert... didn't just
drive into this ravine.

00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:09,840
He had a little help.

00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:13,160
We got a point
of explosion here.

00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:22,636
Okay...

00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:26,173
so the explosion kills him
or incapacitates him,

00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:29,543
the car continues on
till it rolls over the edge.

00:08:29,543 --> 00:08:31,311
This was no accident.

00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:34,347
Someone planted a bomb
in Lambert's car.

00:08:35,415 --> 00:08:37,551
ROBBINS:
<i>Dr. Lambert showed no signs</i>

00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:38,843
of smoke inhalation.

00:08:38,843 --> 00:08:40,487
WILLOWS: So he was dead
before the car caught fire.

00:08:40,487 --> 00:08:42,844
The force of the blast
ruptured his aorta.

00:08:42,844 --> 00:08:44,840
Died almost
instantaneously.

00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,226
Thank you,
Doctor.
Yeah.

00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:47,844
Sara.
Yeah.

00:08:47,844 --> 00:08:49,842
So, what did you find out
about Dr. Lambert?

00:08:49,842 --> 00:08:50,846
Well, he was
never married.

00:08:50,846 --> 00:08:52,399
No bitter ex-wife.
No greedy kids.

00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,838
I'm going to check
with the school

00:08:53,838 --> 00:08:54,845
and see if he
had any enemies.

00:08:54,845 --> 00:08:56,703
What if you just check
with your mother-in-law?

00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:58,171
She's pretty
dialed-in there.

00:08:58,171 --> 00:09:00,307
Uh, yeah, communication's
not really our strong suit.

00:09:00,307 --> 00:09:02,242
I thought you were
learning to sign.
I am.

00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:03,510
I-I'm... I'm improving.

00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,378
It's not really
a language barrier,

00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,845
it's just kind
of a barrier.

00:09:06,845 --> 00:09:08,847
She's very hard
to get close to.

00:09:08,847 --> 00:09:10,784
She questions everything.

00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:12,252
She's got to be right
about everything.

00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:13,753
She's mostly unavailable.

00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:15,422
(chuckling):
Sorry.

00:09:15,422 --> 00:09:16,840
What?
Oh, it's...

00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,845
you just described Grissom.

00:09:18,845 --> 00:09:20,694
Like mother, like son.

00:09:22,496 --> 00:09:24,164
Greg... what
have you got

00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:25,232
going on here?

00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:26,333
I'm almost done rendering

00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:28,268
a 3-D simulation of
your car bombing.

00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:30,846
Based on where the car
was when it exploded,

00:09:30,846 --> 00:09:32,472
how much gas was in the tank,

00:09:32,472 --> 00:09:34,307
and using standard
temperature and pressure,

00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:37,310
I was able to calculate
the size of the explosion

00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,842
and the shock waves
it produced.

00:09:38,842 --> 00:09:41,581
Now, the white dots represent

00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,845
our witnesses and their
respective locations,

00:09:43,845 --> 00:09:45,418
at the time of the explosion.

00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,847
Simulation's complete.

00:09:46,847 --> 00:09:49,155
Let's blow somebody up.

00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:51,758
The shock waves hit the dorm

00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:54,227
and the surrounding buildings,
like our witnesses said;

00:09:54,227 --> 00:09:55,729
except they never reached

00:09:55,729 --> 00:09:58,665
the Humanities building,
though our witness there

00:09:58,665 --> 00:09:59,841
claims she had felt it.

00:09:59,841 --> 00:10:01,167
It's impossible.

00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:02,702
SANDERS:
Yeah. The dormitories

00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:04,271
are blocking
the Humanities building.

00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:05,238
Who's the witness?

00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,375
(beep)

00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:09,643
WILLOWS:
Julia Holden.

00:10:09,643 --> 00:10:11,344
She lied to me.

00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:12,746
WILLOWS: You think
she was involved?

00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:14,838
SIDLE: If she was,
we'll need evidence to prove it.

00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:20,840
No sign of any nitrates
or bomb-making materials yet.

00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,843
Well, maybe she made
the bomb somewhere else.

00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:27,838
Oop. Incoming.

00:10:27,838 --> 00:10:28,847
OFFICER: Sorry, ma'am.
Can't go in there.

00:10:28,847 --> 00:10:30,297
SIDLE:
It's okay.

00:10:32,566 --> 00:10:34,267
What are you doing here?

00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:37,203
Well, we're... conducting
a murder investigation.

00:10:37,847 --> 00:10:40,173
What's going on, Nick?

00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,244
Mrs. Grissom, we have reason
to believe that...

00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:46,847
that somebody might have planted
a bomb in Dr. Lambert's car.

00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:48,548
A bomb?!

00:10:48,548 --> 00:10:49,846
Yes, ma'am.

00:10:49,846 --> 00:10:51,585
You don't think

00:10:51,585 --> 00:10:53,520
Julia had anything
to do with it?

00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,721
SIDLE:
Julia...

00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:55,789
you...

00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:57,390
were not being honest...

00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,846
about where you were
when the bomb went off.

00:10:59,846 --> 00:11:02,295
Where were you really?

00:11:06,847 --> 00:11:09,302
I haven't
done anything wrong.

00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:15,843
Okay. We're executing a search
warrant, and we're gonna need

00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:16,847
both of you

00:11:16,847 --> 00:11:20,413
to wait in the hall
until we're done.

00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:27,487
You don't seem to be
winning any points with
your mother-in-law.

00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:29,489
She really seems
to like me, though.

00:11:31,842 --> 00:11:33,847
STOKES:
What's that?

00:11:33,847 --> 00:11:36,838
It's a message...

00:11:36,838 --> 00:11:39,844
a transcript from
Julia's voice mail.

00:11:39,844 --> 00:11:42,469
Dr. Lambert called her
the night that he was killed.

00:11:42,469 --> 00:11:43,840
What's the message?

00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,842
SIDLE:
<i>"Julia, we need to talk.</i>

00:11:45,842 --> 00:11:47,140
"This relationship
has to end.

00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,842
"You know the risks
involved, to us

00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:49,842
"and to the school.

00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:51,839
We can't let it
continue."

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,480
BRASS:
So, let me guess,

00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,482
Lambert dumped you,
and you blew him up.

00:11:56,838 --> 00:11:59,552
I wasn't sleeping
with Dr. Lambert.

00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,788
And I certainly
didn't kill him.

00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:03,156
So he wasn't the man that

00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:04,843
you were having sex with
at the party?

00:12:05,844 --> 00:12:08,194
BRASS:
You lied to us about

00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:09,729
being in your
office at the time

00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:10,839
of the explosion.

00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:13,633
I think you planted
the bomb in his car,

00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:15,769
and then you followed him
to make sure it detonated.

00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:17,604
And then you pretended
like you just got there

00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:19,172
and you were
trying to save him.

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,175
I told you,
I didn't kill him.

00:12:29,844 --> 00:12:31,351
Obviously...

00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:33,586
there's a conflict
of interest here.

00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,356
What's she talking about?

00:12:38,843 --> 00:12:41,846
My history with your husband.

00:12:41,846 --> 00:12:44,664
What history?

00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,844
We were involved.

00:12:47,844 --> 00:12:49,502
Intimately.

00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,409
Well, this is awkward.

00:12:59,841 --> 00:13:01,838
He didn't tell you?

00:13:01,838 --> 00:13:03,838
I assumed

00:13:03,838 --> 00:13:05,785
married people told
each other everything.

00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,555
My marriage has nothing
to do with this case.

00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,840
It does now.

00:13:17,843 --> 00:13:19,838
(clears throat)

00:13:26,846 --> 00:13:30,143
So, Julia Holden agreed
to give us a DNA sample

00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,345
but wouldn't say anything
else without her lawyer.

00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:34,481
Yeah, of course she wouldn't.

00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,616
She totally played me.

00:13:36,616 --> 00:13:38,785
She knew exactly who
I was, and she knew

00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:40,754
that I didn't know anything
about her and Gil.

00:13:40,754 --> 00:13:42,838
Come on, I mean,
for all you know,

00:13:42,838 --> 00:13:44,841
they only went out
a couple of times.

00:13:44,841 --> 00:13:46,493
Well, they slept together.

00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:47,840
She made that perfectly clear.

00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,630
She also made it perfectly clear
that she would not continue

00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,846
with the interview
until I was out of the room.

00:13:54,768 --> 00:13:55,847
What did Brass say?

00:13:55,847 --> 00:13:58,838
What do you think?
He wants you off the case.

00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,473
I said no.

00:14:00,473 --> 00:14:02,442
I told him that
you're a professional,

00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:03,510
and completely capable

00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:07,313
of being objective.
Thanks.

00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:08,715
You<i>are capable of being</i>

00:14:08,715 --> 00:14:10,183
professional
and objective, right?

00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:11,551
Yes, I am.

00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:12,752
Great.

00:14:12,752 --> 00:14:14,187
We didn't find
any evidence

00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:17,157
of bomb-making materials at
Julia's office or her house.

00:14:17,157 --> 00:14:18,658
Maybe the guys'll
find something.

00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:21,839
They're checking
Lambert's car now.

00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:26,299
(groans quietly)

00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:28,838
Well, this used
to be a gas tank.

00:14:28,838 --> 00:14:31,237
Yeah. Not much
left of it.

00:14:33,844 --> 00:14:36,142
(clanking)

00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:37,310
What is that, a magnet?

00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,445
Industrial-strength magnet.

00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:40,846
Must have used it

00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:43,283
to secure the bomb
to the gas tank.

00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:45,841
(grunts)

00:14:45,841 --> 00:14:48,838
I think you're losing your
superpowers there, Dr. Ray.

00:14:48,838 --> 00:14:49,841
(chuckles)

00:14:49,841 --> 00:14:52,492
Come on, let's
go check it out.

00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:54,846
Yeah...

00:14:54,846 --> 00:14:58,698
this thing is...
pretty badly scorched.

00:14:58,698 --> 00:15:02,843
STOKES: These are all the bomb
fragments we got on the road.

00:15:02,843 --> 00:15:04,838
We've got a detonator, but...

00:15:04,838 --> 00:15:07,407
we still haven't found
a timer of any kind.

00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:08,845
Lambert's car
was left unattended

00:15:08,845 --> 00:15:10,276
during the party--
that's a perfect

00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:12,612
opportunity for someone
to come along and...

00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:14,480
plant the bomb.
Killer waits

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,839
for Lambert to leave the party,

00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:17,350
follow him--
when the car gets

00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,252
close enough to the ravine,
flip a switch and boom,

00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:20,753
car blows up
and goes off the road.

00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,655
That means that
the killer was on campus.

00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:23,839
Let's get the fragments
over to Trace,

00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,525
see if we can get
anything off of 'em.

00:15:41,844 --> 00:15:44,143
I found nitrates
on the bomb fragments

00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:45,612
consistent with
smokeless gunpowder.

00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:47,380
The last time we saw

00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,182
smokeless gunpowder
was in the bombs

00:15:49,182 --> 00:15:50,550
planted at the police funeral.

00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,842
Except those devices
were more sophisticated.

00:15:52,842 --> 00:15:54,454
Yeah, well,

00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:58,157
based on the scorch marks,
I'm guessing that this was used

00:15:58,157 --> 00:15:59,692
to hold the explosives.

00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:01,843
The curved shape
would have given the blast

00:16:01,843 --> 00:16:03,842
the directional component,
driving it upward

00:16:03,842 --> 00:16:05,531
into the gas tank.

00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:07,839
I've recovered a
partial serial number

00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:10,703
and manufacturer's mark--
I'm just running it now.

00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:12,505
Hm. Looks like you got a hit.

00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,675
Company that makes

00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:17,143
consumer products for the deaf.

00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:18,678
Looks like our
bell-shaped charge

00:16:18,678 --> 00:16:20,843
started its life as
part of something called the...

00:16:20,843 --> 00:16:21,844
Shake Alert.

00:16:21,844 --> 00:16:23,182
I got one of those.

00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:25,685
What do you need with
a deaf fire alarm?

00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:27,754
My mother snores like a bear.

00:16:27,754 --> 00:16:29,522
So I sleep
with ear plugs.

00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:30,657
If there's a fire,

00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:32,525
then the Shake Alert
receives a signal

00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:34,460
from any standard
smoke detector

00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:38,464
and... shakes my bed,
wakes me up and saves my life.

00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:39,532
Okay.

00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,436
This Shake Alert
came from a batch

00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:48,541
installed in the dorms
at Gilbert College.

00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:51,842
(music blaring)

00:16:58,151 --> 00:16:59,719
♪ ♪

00:17:05,845 --> 00:17:07,560
(turns music off)

00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:21,741
(turns on music)

00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:25,611
(music playing in distance)

00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:30,249
Sorry.

00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:37,390
Hey, Sara?

00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,258
Yeah.

00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:41,361
This fire alarm
is different than
the other ones.

00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:43,262
It's white-- all the
other ones were black.

00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:45,365
Could be brand-new.

00:17:45,365 --> 00:17:47,300
Whose room is this?

00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,768
Michael Porter.

00:17:48,768 --> 00:17:51,437
He's Julia
Holden's T.A.

00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:53,773
STOKES: What happened to your
old fire alarm, Michael?

00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:54,844
I don't know.

00:17:54,844 --> 00:17:56,841
I didn't even know
it was replaced.

00:17:56,841 --> 00:17:57,845
You weren't at the party
last night--

00:17:57,845 --> 00:17:59,345
were you in your room
the whole time?

00:18:00,843 --> 00:18:02,148
Yes.

00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:03,716
Really, I should've
been at the party.

00:18:05,151 --> 00:18:06,786
Apparently,
Julia and Dr. Lambert

00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:08,221
didn't consider
my research project

00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:09,843
worthy of
the Gilbert Grant.

00:18:09,843 --> 00:18:12,759
Well, a half million dollars is
a lot of money to miss out on.

00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,694
I've been Julia's
T.A. for two years,

00:18:14,694 --> 00:18:15,842
doing research,

00:18:15,842 --> 00:18:17,597
I even picked up
her dry cleaning.

00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:18,845
Then suddenly
this Sean Wyatt guy

00:18:18,845 --> 00:18:22,435
shows up from England--
it's like he's the chosen one.

00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,170
And a finalist for the grant.

00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:27,838
He's Julia's pet.

00:18:27,838 --> 00:18:30,676
Was Sean
Dr. Lambert's pet as well?

00:18:31,744 --> 00:18:32,845
Hardly.

00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:35,314
<i>A few days ago,</i>
<i>I saw them arguing.</i>

00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:36,582
<i>It got pretty heated.</i>

00:18:39,842 --> 00:18:40,842
(angry grunt)

00:18:40,842 --> 00:18:43,723
What was that
argument about?

00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:47,226
I'm not sure.

00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:49,395
But Dr. Lambert
said something like,

00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:51,840
"If you don't
fix this, I will."

00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,666
SIDLE:
<i>Sean Wyatt is</i>

00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,843
a big fan of Julia's work.

00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,770
He's got a lot
of her books.

00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,472
This kid's in the
deaf studies program

00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,541
and she's his advisor, so...

00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:02,575
(quiet beeping)

00:19:04,844 --> 00:19:06,838
Sara? Hm?

00:19:06,838 --> 00:19:08,314
Positive for nitrates.

00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:13,838
Okay, well, we know that Sean
and Dr. Lambert had a fight.

00:19:13,838 --> 00:19:15,655
Maybe Lambert decided
not to give him

00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:16,847
the half-million dollars.

00:19:16,847 --> 00:19:19,325
And Sean decides
to get rid of him?
Yeah.

00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:20,840
With Lambert
out of the way,

00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,728
Julia gets to choose
the grant winner,

00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:24,363
and Sean gets
the half a million.

00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:26,399
<i>Sean is Julia's student.</i>

00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:28,668
She was the first one
at the scene andshe lied.

00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,570
You still like Julia
Holden for this, don't you?

00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:33,272
I do.
Why? None of the physical
evidence points to her.

00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:34,707
I am not making this personal.

00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:37,210
Okay.
All right,
maybe a little.

00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:40,379
You know, it would've
been nice if Gil had told
me about him and Julia.

00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:41,845
It's ancient history--
I'm sure it happened

00:19:41,845 --> 00:19:43,843
before the two of you
even got together.

00:19:43,843 --> 00:19:46,385
She ispretty.

00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:48,187
Yeah.

00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,189
Yeah, she's pretty.

00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,592
She's very pretty,
actually.

00:19:54,227 --> 00:19:55,328
Hi, Mrs. G.

00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:56,844
Oh, great.
Hi, Betty.

00:19:58,498 --> 00:20:00,566
Um, I'll catch up.

00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:03,402
Okay. See you
back at the lab.

00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:08,844
I heard you called Julia
in for more questioning.

00:20:08,844 --> 00:20:11,844
Well, yes-- she's a suspect
in Dr. Lambert's murder.

00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,149
Julia would never
hurt anyone.

00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:17,483
I know her.

00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:19,839
Obviously, she was intimately
involved with your son.

00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,687
Thanks for the heads-up,
by the way.

00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:23,840
I thought you knew.

00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,592
No.

00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:31,797
Maybe if you and Gil saw
each other more often,

00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:33,633
you'd know more
about each other.

00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:44,377
Betty...

00:20:44,377 --> 00:20:47,180
a man was murdered,
someone you know.

00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,782
If there was
something going on

00:20:49,782 --> 00:20:53,786
between Julia and Dr. Lambert,
you have to tell me.

00:20:57,847 --> 00:21:00,846
Dr. Lambert was a
stickler for rules

00:21:00,846 --> 00:21:03,362
and deadlines.

00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:06,332
Lately, Julia's
been distracted.

00:21:06,332 --> 00:21:08,844
Late with paperwork,
missing classes.

00:21:08,844 --> 00:21:11,204
Any idea why?

00:21:11,204 --> 00:21:13,239
I asked her about it.

00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:15,741
She said everything was fine.

00:21:17,677 --> 00:21:19,278
Thank you.

00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:24,350
Hey, I tested
the nitrates

00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:26,485
in Sean Wyatt's room.

00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:28,221
Did he have a plant?

00:21:28,221 --> 00:21:30,590
A dead fern
and a cactus.
Ah.

00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:32,391
The classic male green thumb.

00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:35,842
Explains why the nitrates are
less consistent with explosives

00:21:35,842 --> 00:21:38,397
and more consistent
with fertilizer.

00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:40,433
I did, however, find something

00:21:40,433 --> 00:21:42,845
on the sheets you collected
from his dorm room.

00:21:42,845 --> 00:21:44,847
Hair and vaginal
contributions.

00:21:44,847 --> 00:21:46,639
Both from Julia Holden.

00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:48,641
Having sex with
one of her students.

00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:49,709
Maybe Sean
was the one

00:21:49,709 --> 00:21:52,245
that Julia was having sex with
in the bathroom.

00:21:52,245 --> 00:21:53,479
Ooh.

00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:55,846
Quite the libertine.

00:21:55,846 --> 00:21:58,847
Not unlike Lady Heather.

00:21:58,847 --> 00:22:02,355
Clearly, Grissom has
a yen for sexually
adventurous women

00:22:02,355 --> 00:22:04,838
whose voracious appetites

00:22:04,838 --> 00:22:07,840
can only be sated by dangerous
and unbridled passion.

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,842
Thank you.
(clears throat)

00:22:08,842 --> 00:22:11,840
Um, at-at least
most of the time.

00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,167
That is, until he
realized, of course,

00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,840
that even though you can
have sexual satisfaction,

00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,505
it doesn't hold a candle

00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:21,540
to spirited
intellectual stimulation.

00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,775
Not...

00:22:22,775 --> 00:22:26,445
to say that
you and Grissom don't...

00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:28,781
have a great
sex life, um...

00:22:28,781 --> 00:22:31,845
I mean, when you happen to be
in the same city... (chuckles)

00:22:31,845 --> 00:22:33,519
Isn't that your phone
down the hall?

00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:35,454
Yes, it is. Thank you.

00:22:40,842 --> 00:22:44,163
Grissom and I have great sex.

00:22:44,163 --> 00:22:46,299
I'm sure you do.

00:22:46,299 --> 00:22:48,401
Okay, so, um...

00:22:48,401 --> 00:22:49,847
Lambert... (clears throat)

00:22:49,847 --> 00:22:52,738
left a message
on Julia's phone

00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:54,540
about a relationship
that had to end--

00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,847
maybe he was talking about Sean.

00:22:56,847 --> 00:23:00,646
Sex with a student is a huge
scandal for the school, and...

00:23:00,646 --> 00:23:03,616
it's kind of a career ender
for Julia Holden.

00:23:03,616 --> 00:23:06,352
Maybe Sean didn't just
kill Lambert for the money,

00:23:06,352 --> 00:23:08,387
maybe he killed him for love.

00:23:10,156 --> 00:23:12,558
Okay.

00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:13,793
Mr. Wyatt,

00:23:13,793 --> 00:23:15,261
we found evidence in your room

00:23:15,261 --> 00:23:17,363
that you and Julia Holden
had a sexual relationship,

00:23:17,363 --> 00:23:19,198
and my guess is that Lambert
found out about it,

00:23:19,198 --> 00:23:21,267
and that's what
your argument was about.

00:23:21,267 --> 00:23:22,368
Am I going too fast for you?

00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:23,736
Okay.

00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:24,838
(sighs)

00:23:24,838 --> 00:23:25,847
Yes.

00:23:25,847 --> 00:23:28,774
He demanded that I
withdraw my application

00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:30,840
to the Gilbert Grant.
He told me that

00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,279
my affair with Julia could
be seen as favoritism.

00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:34,513
Oh, you think?

00:23:34,513 --> 00:23:36,682
And then you put
a bomb in his car.

00:23:36,682 --> 00:23:39,845
You killed Lambert,
Julia gets to keep her job,

00:23:39,845 --> 00:23:43,589
you get to keep your grant--
everybody wins.

00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:46,158
No, I loved Julia.

00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:47,847
And yes, I wanted the grant,

00:23:47,847 --> 00:23:49,840
but I didn't kill anyone.

00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,631
You were at the party,
you had motive and opportunity.

00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:56,168
When Lambert left,
you followed him.

00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:58,437
I left the party beforehe did.

00:23:58,437 --> 00:23:59,739
Where'd you go?

00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,838
I went back to
my dorm room.

00:24:02,838 --> 00:24:04,377
Can anyone confirm that?

00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:07,146
Julia.

00:24:07,146 --> 00:24:11,283
She arrived at quarter to 10:00,
and left before 11:00.

00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:14,620
Just before the explosion.

00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:42,148
What do you want now?

00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:44,216
We have more questions for you.

00:24:45,351 --> 00:24:46,842
You need to come with us.

00:24:47,843 --> 00:24:50,156
Fine. Let me call my lawyer.

00:24:50,843 --> 00:24:52,258
Fine.

00:24:56,796 --> 00:24:58,845
(alarm blaring)

00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:08,140
Are you guys all right?
Yeah, we're fine.
We're fine.

00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,845
You okay?
SIDE: Yeah.
LANGSTON: The paramedics took

00:25:09,845 --> 00:25:11,143
Julia Holden to the hospital,

00:25:11,143 --> 00:25:12,144
possible concussion.

00:25:12,144 --> 00:25:14,213
Right before the explosion,

00:25:14,213 --> 00:25:15,381
we saw Michael,

00:25:15,381 --> 00:25:17,516
Julia's T.A., place
a package on her desk.

00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,351
You think it was the bomb?
Well, we already

00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,720
know that Michael had a beef
with Julia and Dr. Lambert.

00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,589
LANGSTON: The bomb
in Dr. Lambert's car
didn't give us much,

00:25:23,589 --> 00:25:25,324
but, here, we're
in a contained space

00:25:25,324 --> 00:25:27,193
and there was no fire--
we should be able

00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:28,427
to collect
a lot more evidence.

00:25:28,427 --> 00:25:31,664
Yeah... yeah, maybe enough
to pin this on Michael.

00:25:42,575 --> 00:25:45,211
SIDLE: Piece of a box.
Looks like the bomb was

00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:47,513
hidden in a package.

00:25:47,513 --> 00:25:48,845
STOKES:
You know, most...

00:25:48,845 --> 00:25:52,151
package bombs are rigged
to explode when you open them,

00:25:52,151 --> 00:25:53,652
but I think this one

00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:55,221
was a little bit different.

00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:58,840
Got a resistor-- it creates
a delay, like a timer.

00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,259
If you're gonna
hand-deliver a bomb,

00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:02,841
you want to make sure
you have time to get away.

00:26:03,842 --> 00:26:05,798
I would never kill anyone.

00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:06,845
Really?

00:26:06,845 --> 00:26:08,467
Your computer
says different.

00:26:08,467 --> 00:26:09,846
Nice stalker wall.

00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:14,847
You had a grudge against Julia
because she recommended

00:26:14,847 --> 00:26:17,847
Sean Wyatt for the grant
instead of you.

00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:24,216
I was angry.

00:26:24,216 --> 00:26:25,551
I needed to vent.

00:26:25,551 --> 00:26:27,319
I should have had a chance

00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:29,455
at that grant--
they took it from me.

00:26:32,842 --> 00:26:36,846
I did not put the bomb
in Dr. Lambert's car

00:26:36,846 --> 00:26:38,731
or Julia's office.

00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:41,838
Michael, you have the skills.

00:26:41,838 --> 00:26:43,842
Your major is
electrical engineering.

00:26:43,842 --> 00:26:46,205
You're doing R&amp;D
on deaf assist devices.

00:26:46,205 --> 00:26:48,507
We recovered a resistor
from the bomb

00:26:48,507 --> 00:26:50,845
in Julia's office
that traces to a batch

00:26:50,845 --> 00:26:53,178
that you ordered
for your research.

00:26:54,213 --> 00:26:55,845
You've got the wrong person.

00:26:55,845 --> 00:26:59,318
The parts you're talking
about were stolen from me.

00:27:00,386 --> 00:27:02,838
I reported it
to the campus police.

00:27:02,838 --> 00:27:04,490
Go ahead and ask them.

00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:06,225
Oh, we will.

00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:11,463
Somebody's setting me up.

00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,732
Who would do that?

00:27:14,767 --> 00:27:17,202
Have you checked
into Sean Wyatt?

00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:18,843
I mean, really
looked into him?

00:27:18,843 --> 00:27:20,339
There's something
strange.

00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:22,274
I don't know
exactly what it is,

00:27:22,274 --> 00:27:25,611
but... something's
just not right with him.

00:27:50,845 --> 00:27:52,846
WOMAN (over P.A.): Dr. Alist,
call the page operator.

00:27:52,846 --> 00:27:55,507
Dr. Alist, call the page
operator.

00:27:57,142 --> 00:27:58,611
Mind if I join you?

00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:05,551
I hope you're not here
to accuse Julia

00:28:05,551 --> 00:28:08,845
of blowing up
her own office.

00:28:08,845 --> 00:28:12,224
Actually, we have
a new suspect-- Michael.

00:28:12,224 --> 00:28:13,839
He's Julia's T.A.

00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,842
I find it
so hard to believe

00:28:16,842 --> 00:28:19,498
that there's someone
in this school,

00:28:19,498 --> 00:28:21,842
in our community,

00:28:21,842 --> 00:28:24,370
capable of such violence.

00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:26,372
When I went to take
Julia's statement just now,

00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:28,273
I saw her talking
to Sean Wyatt,

00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:29,708
and he signed something

00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,844
that I didn't recognize,
nor did he.

00:28:31,844 --> 00:28:34,647
Do you know
what this means?

00:28:43,844 --> 00:28:46,841
That means "sweet pea" in LSQ.

00:28:46,841 --> 00:28:49,395
It's Quebec Sign Language.

00:28:51,764 --> 00:28:54,700
Sign language is just
like any other language--

00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:57,670
it varies by... region,

00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:59,845
has its own
dialect, slang...

00:28:59,845 --> 00:29:01,847
Oh, I know that, but
Sean is from England--

00:29:01,847 --> 00:29:03,442
why would he be
speaking Quebecoise?

00:29:05,843 --> 00:29:08,147
Maybe he spent
some time in Quebec

00:29:08,147 --> 00:29:10,282
and picked up
some of the slang.

00:29:10,282 --> 00:29:12,841
It's possible.

00:29:12,841 --> 00:29:14,753
When Gil and I first
got back from Europe,

00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:15,788
there were
certain phrases

00:29:15,788 --> 00:29:17,845
that stuck with me
for a while, too.

00:29:18,846 --> 00:29:20,392
Don't you miss it?

00:29:20,392 --> 00:29:21,593
Europe?

00:29:23,195 --> 00:29:25,364
Being with your husband.

00:29:28,667 --> 00:29:30,369
What kind of marriage
do you have?

00:29:30,369 --> 00:29:31,846
You two barely
even see each other.

00:29:31,846 --> 00:29:33,841
You don't even live
in the same town.

00:29:33,841 --> 00:29:35,641
We talk every day,
we see each other

00:29:35,641 --> 00:29:36,843
at least once a month.

00:29:36,843 --> 00:29:38,243
That is not a marriage.

00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:41,246
I lost my husband
too soon.

00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:44,349
But in all the years
that we were married,

00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:46,838
we never spent
one night apart.

00:29:46,838 --> 00:29:51,657
It's unconventional,
but what Gil and I have works.

00:29:51,657 --> 00:29:53,392
We love each other.

00:29:53,392 --> 00:29:55,561
We're a family, and...

00:29:55,561 --> 00:29:56,844
You know what, if...
if you don't want

00:29:56,844 --> 00:29:58,840
to be a part of it,
that's your call.

00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:38,637
♪ ♪

00:30:41,846 --> 00:30:44,743
STOKES:<i>The bomb in</i>
<i>Julia Holden's office used</i>

00:30:44,743 --> 00:30:47,479
the same smokeless gunpowder as
the bomb in Dr. Lambert's car.

00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:49,314
No surprise.

00:30:49,314 --> 00:30:51,483
Check this out--
this resistor

00:30:51,483 --> 00:30:52,842
keeps electricity from
reaching the detonator

00:30:52,842 --> 00:30:54,419
for a specific
amount of time.

00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:56,844
Now, in this case,
ten minutes.

00:30:56,844 --> 00:30:57,847
SIDLE:
Wow, that is not

00:30:57,847 --> 00:30:59,846
a lot of time to wrap
and deliver the bomb

00:30:59,846 --> 00:31:01,527
before it exploded.
No, it is not.

00:31:01,527 --> 00:31:03,840
That's why the bomber used
a remote to arm it.

00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,664
So whoever wanted
to blow up Julia Holden

00:31:05,664 --> 00:31:07,533
had to make sure
that bomb was

00:31:07,533 --> 00:31:08,845
in her office
and that

00:31:08,845 --> 00:31:10,842
she was there
before they set that timer.

00:31:10,842 --> 00:31:12,204
Bomber had to be nearby.

00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:13,840
Try within earshot.

00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,309
When the bomber used the remote,

00:31:17,309 --> 00:31:20,245
it sent a signal
to the receiver.

00:31:22,845 --> 00:31:24,845
(beeping)

00:31:24,845 --> 00:31:27,252
Now, that beeping sound
tells the bomber

00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:28,839
that the device is armed.

00:31:28,839 --> 00:31:30,840
So whoever did this

00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,324
could hear just fine.

00:31:32,324 --> 00:31:34,839
So Michael wasn't the bomber?

00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:37,229
WILLOWS:
We're looking

00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:38,839
for somebody outside
the deaf community.

00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,667
Yes and no.

00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:47,506
I had nothing to do with
that bomb in Julia's office.

00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:50,509
I love her.

00:31:50,509 --> 00:31:52,144
I'd never
hurt her.

00:31:52,144 --> 00:31:54,839
Then this lie detector
test will prove it.

00:31:56,148 --> 00:31:58,350
SIDLE: We're gonna show you
a series of pictures

00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:00,485
and measure your
brain's response.

00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:02,254
Are you ready?

00:32:04,523 --> 00:32:05,591
Go ahead.

00:32:11,597 --> 00:32:12,839
(electronic oscillations,
clicking)

00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:15,534
He recollects Julia Holden.

00:32:20,372 --> 00:32:23,840
(electronic oscillations,
clicks, pops)

00:32:24,841 --> 00:32:27,845
No recollection
of the bomb materials.

00:32:29,181 --> 00:32:32,217
(electronic tones, clicking)

00:32:32,217 --> 00:32:34,843
No recollection of the bombing.

00:32:37,389 --> 00:32:38,590
Sean, I've got

00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,559
some bad news-- you failed.

00:32:45,597 --> 00:32:47,432
I didn't set that bomb.

00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:49,841
The machine's inaccurate--
everybody knows that.

00:32:49,841 --> 00:32:53,372
Well, you're right, Sean, uh,
polygraphs aren't reliable.

00:32:53,372 --> 00:32:55,407
Thank you very much.
It's okay.

00:32:55,407 --> 00:32:57,839
But we didn't give
you a polygraph,

00:32:57,839 --> 00:33:00,512
we gave you an Auditory
Evoked Potential Test.

00:33:00,512 --> 00:33:03,649
It actually measures your
brain's response to sound.

00:33:03,649 --> 00:33:05,838
During the test, we played
a series of clicking sounds.

00:33:05,838 --> 00:33:07,844
You acted as though
you didn't hear them,

00:33:07,844 --> 00:33:09,488
but your brain said otherwise.

00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:11,839
The spikes in
your brain wave

00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:14,593
indicate that you hear
just fine.

00:33:14,593 --> 00:33:16,295
You're not deaf, Sean.
You're a fraud.

00:33:16,847 --> 00:33:18,764
You're also a killer.

00:33:25,704 --> 00:33:26,846
Sean Wyatt still
isn't talking,

00:33:26,846 --> 00:33:28,844
with or without
an interpreter.

00:33:28,844 --> 00:33:30,475
So he faked being deaf

00:33:30,475 --> 00:33:31,710
for the half-a-million
dollar grant.

00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:33,842
And if Dr. Lambert found
out that he was a fraud,

00:33:33,842 --> 00:33:35,841
that would be motive
for murder right there.

00:33:35,841 --> 00:33:37,382
Well, Sean lied
about being deaf;

00:33:37,382 --> 00:33:39,318
makes you wonder what
else he's lying about.

00:33:58,503 --> 00:33:59,847
SIDLE:
<i>His real name</i>

00:33:59,847 --> 00:34:02,174
is Sean Wyatt Leblanc,
and he's not from England

00:34:02,174 --> 00:34:03,847
he's from Canada--
Montreal to be exact.

00:34:03,847 --> 00:34:05,846
And he lied about everything.

00:34:05,846 --> 00:34:08,313
Including being deaf.

00:34:08,313 --> 00:34:10,148
It's not possible.

00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:12,217
We gave him an Auditory
Evoked Potential Test.

00:34:12,217 --> 00:34:13,719
He can hear.

00:34:15,654 --> 00:34:19,658
It can't be easy to fool an
entire campus of deaf students

00:34:19,658 --> 00:34:22,561
including a smart,
savvy professor.

00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:25,230
One that he was intimately
involved with.

00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,232
Are you saying that I knew?

00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:29,701
Sean's transcripts were forged

00:34:29,701 --> 00:34:32,170
using paper with a
Gilbert College watermark,

00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,845
which means that he had help
from someone inside the school.

00:34:34,845 --> 00:34:37,840
No. When I met Sean,
he was already a student.

00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:42,844
I was his thesis advisor.

00:34:42,844 --> 00:34:46,385
We started spending
a lot of time together.

00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:50,422
<i>One night, we were working late</i>

00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:51,790
<i>and he kissed me.</i>

00:34:56,841 --> 00:35:00,499
I should have
put a stop to it.

00:35:00,499 --> 00:35:02,601
But when a young,
good-looking guy

00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:06,839
tells you that you're beautiful
and he can't get enough of you,

00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:09,508
you want to believe it.

00:35:10,847 --> 00:35:13,840
I fell in love with him.

00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:17,838
I haven't felt that
for a long time.

00:35:17,838 --> 00:35:19,847
With all that time that you
and Sean spent together,

00:35:19,847 --> 00:35:22,521
you never suspected
that he could hear?

00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:28,838
There was a time that I saw
him sign something wrong.

00:35:28,838 --> 00:35:30,841
It was Quebec Sign Language.

00:35:30,841 --> 00:35:32,297
And I asked him about it.

00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:35,400
He said that it was our secret

00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,636
term of endearment.

00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:40,841
Something that no one
on the campus would understand.

00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:46,445
My career has been my life.

00:35:49,181 --> 00:35:51,416
I didn't realize
how lonely I was.

00:35:55,287 --> 00:36:00,840
We... we all have this need

00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:05,230
to find that one person
to connect with.

00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:07,843
And when we do,

00:36:07,843 --> 00:36:12,370
we find that we're overlooking

00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:15,607
their imperfections
and disappointments.

00:36:16,839 --> 00:36:18,843
He was using me.

00:36:20,712 --> 00:36:22,547
I'm sorry, Julia.

00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:28,487
Is there anything
that you know about Sean?

00:36:28,487 --> 00:36:30,188
Anything that
might help us?

00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:37,562
One night I did go
into his room--

00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:39,564
while he was e-mailing--

00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:41,733
and e was using a different
e-mail address.

00:36:41,733 --> 00:36:42,801
It was in French.

00:36:42,801 --> 00:36:45,337
I thought maybe
it was another girl.

00:36:45,337 --> 00:36:47,844
He said, no, it was
just an old friend.

00:36:47,844 --> 00:36:49,842
Do you know who
he was writing to?

00:36:49,842 --> 00:36:51,510
No.

00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:58,839
But I do remember the e-mail
address that he was using.

00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,154
I got an A.G. waiver

00:37:02,154 --> 00:37:03,845
on the e-mail account
that Julia gave us.
Oh.

00:37:03,845 --> 00:37:05,657
The e-mail's
practically a blueprint

00:37:05,657 --> 00:37:06,846
for the entire grant scam,

00:37:06,846 --> 00:37:08,844
starting with getting
accepted to the school.

00:37:08,844 --> 00:37:10,629
And finishing with the bombings?

00:37:10,629 --> 00:37:12,230
No, but there was
a threat implied.

00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,840
Sean was clearly worried that
Dr. Lambert was on to him.

00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,169
He and his partner knew
they had to do something.

00:37:17,169 --> 00:37:18,303
Who's his partner?

00:37:18,303 --> 00:37:19,704
His cousin from Montreal.

00:37:19,704 --> 00:37:22,840
But fortunately, we don't have
to go that far to find him.

00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,710
He's been hiding
in plain sight.

00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,312
BRASS:
Dennis Palmer.

00:37:27,312 --> 00:37:28,780
It must feel
a little lonely,

00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:29,838
huh, Dennis?

00:37:29,838 --> 00:37:31,183
Being an interpreter
for the deaf?

00:37:31,183 --> 00:37:33,251
I mean, you're part
of everyone's

00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,787
intimate conversations,
but somehow you're
on the outside.

00:37:35,787 --> 00:37:37,756
You're... you know,
you're like...

00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:38,842
Invisible?

00:37:38,842 --> 00:37:40,847
Yeah-- invisible.
Exactly.

00:37:40,847 --> 00:37:42,839
It's part of the job.

00:37:42,839 --> 00:37:43,846
It's also part of the job

00:37:43,846 --> 00:37:45,838
to have access to all
the buildings on campus,

00:37:45,838 --> 00:37:46,840
including Julia
Holden's office.

00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,844
We checked.
You used your key card

00:37:48,844 --> 00:37:52,237
to enter Julia's building
30 minutes before the explosion.

00:37:52,237 --> 00:37:54,841
I was dropping a transcript off
in Dr. Gardner's...
We searched your room.

00:37:54,841 --> 00:37:56,441
You know,
for an invisible man,

00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:58,243
you leave a lot
of evidence behind.

00:37:58,243 --> 00:38:00,545
We found receipts for
gunpowder and pipes.

00:38:00,545 --> 00:38:02,781
We knew you were at the
party with Dr. Lambert.

00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:04,249
So you planted that
bomb under his car.

00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:13,358
<i>You dropped off the package</i>

00:38:13,358 --> 00:38:16,261
<i>that Michael Porter delivered</i>
<i>to Julia's office.</i>

00:38:16,261 --> 00:38:17,846
(beeping)

00:38:17,846 --> 00:38:19,164
When we searched your room,

00:38:19,164 --> 00:38:20,699
we found e-mails
between you and Sean.

00:38:20,699 --> 00:38:22,843
Now we know this whole
con was your idea.

00:38:22,843 --> 00:38:24,336
You're the inside guy.

00:38:24,336 --> 00:38:25,841
You forged his transcript.

00:38:25,841 --> 00:38:28,607
Did you teach him
how to sign as well?

00:38:28,607 --> 00:38:30,508
I learned sign language
as a kid.

00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:32,577
My mother's deaf.

00:38:32,577 --> 00:38:34,246
So Dennis got you
into the school,

00:38:34,246 --> 00:38:36,841
and you agreed to split
the cash with him, right?

00:38:36,841 --> 00:38:38,583
It was easy money.

00:38:38,583 --> 00:38:41,152
Dennis said they were
just giving it away.

00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,388
You know, if you're in
a wheelchair or you're deaf,

00:38:43,388 --> 00:38:44,847
society throws money at you.

00:38:44,847 --> 00:38:47,359
I mean, they have
all these grants
for deaf students.

00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:50,262
Meanwhile, I'm working my ass
off for next to nothing.

00:38:50,262 --> 00:38:52,264
So you thought you'd
bilk the system.

00:38:52,264 --> 00:38:53,665
But you got greedy.

00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:55,500
You went after
the big prize--

00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,436
the half-a-million
dollar grant, right?

00:38:58,436 --> 00:39:01,473
A prize that big,
we needed an edge.

00:39:01,473 --> 00:39:02,707
Is that why you
seduced Julia?

00:39:02,707 --> 00:39:04,509
I needed her endorsement.

00:39:05,842 --> 00:39:08,647
But then I started
to care about her.

00:39:08,647 --> 00:39:10,448
That was the first complication.

00:39:10,448 --> 00:39:11,483
And Lambert was the second.

00:39:11,483 --> 00:39:13,285
Lambert found out
I didn't go to Cambridge.

00:39:13,285 --> 00:39:15,553
<i>Said he wouldn't go</i>
<i>to the police</i>

00:39:15,553 --> 00:39:17,155
<i>if I withdrew</i>
<i>my grant application</i>

00:39:17,155 --> 00:39:19,190
<i>and left the school.</i>

00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,841
So you thought if you
get rid of Lambert,

00:39:20,841 --> 00:39:22,840
you might still have
a shot at the big money.

00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:25,397
Thought we could make it
look like an accident.

00:39:25,397 --> 00:39:27,666
But why the second bomb?
I mean, why target Julia?

00:39:27,666 --> 00:39:29,801
I was trying to take
the heat off of Sean,
put it on Michael.

00:39:29,801 --> 00:39:31,846
Dennis promised me
that Julia wouldn't get hurt.

00:39:31,846 --> 00:39:33,843
Said she wouldn't even
be in her office.

00:39:33,843 --> 00:39:37,175
And you believed him.

00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:03,635
(no voice):
I'm sorry.

00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:10,408
You all right?

00:40:32,839 --> 00:40:35,200
GRISSOM:
The graves were littered
with pupa casings.

00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,402
Looked like somebody dumped
a ton of Rice Krispies

00:40:37,402 --> 00:40:38,847
on top of a bunch
of Halloween skeletons.

00:40:38,847 --> 00:40:40,372
(laughs)

00:40:40,372 --> 00:40:42,707
It indicated that it wasn't
a proper burial.

00:40:42,707 --> 00:40:44,841
During the Inca period, there
was no great punishment.

00:40:44,841 --> 00:40:47,245
We think it was meant
as a warning--

00:40:47,245 --> 00:40:49,447
don't mess with the Moche.

00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,838
Aha.

00:40:50,838 --> 00:40:52,517
So anyway, how a was your week?
What'd you do?

00:40:52,517 --> 00:40:54,552
Well, I almost
got blown up twice.

00:40:54,552 --> 00:40:56,721
I accused
your ex-girlfriend of murder.

00:40:56,721 --> 00:40:58,847
And, oh, I...
I told off your mother.

00:40:58,847 --> 00:41:01,226
Oh, good. You kept busy.

00:41:01,226 --> 00:41:03,846
Yeah. See what happens
when you stand me up?

00:41:03,846 --> 00:41:05,196
Who's that?

00:41:05,196 --> 00:41:06,846
Uh, it's your mother.

00:41:08,233 --> 00:41:10,235
Hi, Mom.

00:41:10,235 --> 00:41:14,539
You never came to the office
when I was working there.

00:41:14,539 --> 00:41:17,839
I heard you and Sara had
an exciting week.

00:41:24,844 --> 00:41:28,386
African violets.

00:41:28,386 --> 00:41:29,788
They're beautiful.

00:41:29,788 --> 00:41:32,557
I told her you liked
vegetation.

00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:35,843
Thank you.

00:41:35,843 --> 00:41:38,496
Um, I'm sorry, too.

00:41:39,531 --> 00:41:42,434
Can we start over?

00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:47,205
When I come back,

00:41:47,205 --> 00:41:49,374
the three of us will
go out to dinner.

00:41:50,839 --> 00:41:52,177
Soon.

00:42:00,585 --> 00:42:05,323
Your mother is talking
about our sex life.

00:42:05,323 --> 00:42:09,840
In Incan society, the Moche
elders would pass down

00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:12,430
their knowledge
of sexual pleasure

00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:13,843
to the younger generation.

00:42:13,843 --> 00:42:18,303
Their stories were documented
on their pottery.

00:42:18,303 --> 00:42:21,606
Little ceramic jars
called "sex pots."

00:42:21,606 --> 00:42:24,375
Sex pots.

00:42:29,843 --> 00:42:32,650
Sometimes too much.

00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:34,486
Love you both.

00:42:34,486 --> 00:42:36,387
Love you, too.

00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:37,838
Bye.
