00:00:06,369 --> 00:00:07,641
WILLOWS:
<i>Cops found a body.</i>

00:00:07,641 --> 00:00:09,372
LANGSTON:
<i>Where?</i>
<i>L.A.</i>

00:00:09,372 --> 00:00:10,574
<i>Ray, we'll find Gloria.</i>

00:00:10,574 --> 00:00:12,375
<i>It's been 72 hours.</i>

00:00:12,375 --> 00:00:14,635
<i>That means she's</i>
<i>already gone.</i>

00:00:14,635 --> 00:00:17,080
She's still alive!
Gloria's still alive, Ray!

00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,639
WILLOWS:<i>I don't think</i>
<i>that you should be here.</i>

00:00:18,639 --> 00:00:20,250
You're going back
to Vegas.

00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,639
This sick bastard's
leaving us a bread crumb trail.

00:00:22,639 --> 00:00:23,639
LANGSTON:
<i>Request immediate backup.</i>

00:00:23,639 --> 00:00:26,223
My location-- the
old Thorpe farm.

00:00:36,466 --> 00:00:38,535
Welcome home, Ray.

00:00:38,535 --> 00:00:40,643
Glad you could make
the family reunion.

00:00:40,643 --> 00:00:42,635
I assume you met Dad.

00:00:42,635 --> 00:00:45,575
He knew you were here the whole
time. He was protecting you?

00:00:45,575 --> 00:00:48,044
He's never protected me
in my life, Ray.

00:00:48,044 --> 00:00:50,640
Never knew me,
never knew my genius.

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,351
Had no idea of my extraordinary,
uh, uh, accomplishments.

00:00:54,351 --> 00:00:57,637
So when he came home, I gave him
a little show-and-tell.

00:00:57,637 --> 00:00:58,955
Now I'm wearing the pants.

00:00:58,955 --> 00:01:00,190
You don't become

00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:02,640
a real man until you take
that first swing at dad.

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,594
Oh, you know me so well, Ray.

00:01:04,594 --> 00:01:07,330
Except with me,
it's many swings, many dads.

00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:10,500
Many, many-- Ray!

00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,635
Careful. I've gotten
very good with this.

00:01:14,635 --> 00:01:16,637
I don't think you want
to shoot me, Warner.

00:01:16,637 --> 00:01:18,275
I think you need me too much.

00:01:18,275 --> 00:01:21,411
These last few kills--
the thrill is gone.

00:01:21,411 --> 00:01:23,580
And I blame you.
No.

00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,640
You never
forget your first, right?

00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:29,085
Tell me, who is Nate Haskell?

00:01:29,085 --> 00:01:30,638
You're digging, Ray.

00:01:30,638 --> 00:01:33,637
You're digging, and you're gonna
keep digging for a long time,

00:01:33,637 --> 00:01:35,258
because the ghosts

00:01:35,258 --> 00:01:37,360
in this house have finally
stopped talking.

00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,640
Right, Dad?

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,638
(grunting)

00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:44,642
Hey, come on, Ray. Huh?

00:01:44,642 --> 00:01:47,971
(grunting)

00:01:47,971 --> 00:01:49,306
Come on, Ray!

00:01:49,306 --> 00:01:51,274
(grunts)

00:01:51,274 --> 00:01:53,640
(grunting)

00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,978
(panting)
(wheezing)

00:01:54,978 --> 00:01:56,246
What's the matter, Ray?

00:01:56,246 --> 00:01:57,547
We're just getting started.

00:01:57,547 --> 00:02:00,584
No. We're done.

00:02:00,584 --> 00:02:02,641
(grunts)

00:02:02,641 --> 00:02:06,641
(panting)

00:02:06,641 --> 00:02:08,425
(sighs)

00:02:08,425 --> 00:02:09,635
(grunts)

00:02:09,635 --> 00:02:11,161
(panting)

00:02:13,063 --> 00:02:14,564
You're all right,
Gloria.

00:02:14,564 --> 00:02:16,566
You're gonna be fine.

00:02:21,004 --> 00:02:23,573
I'm disappointed
in you, Ray.

00:02:23,573 --> 00:02:29,638
I told you, we share
something very special.

00:02:29,638 --> 00:02:31,214
I told you, we're nothing alike.

00:02:31,214 --> 00:02:35,518
Aren't you curious, Ray?

00:02:35,518 --> 00:02:37,642
Don't you wonder
why she's still alive?

00:02:37,642 --> 00:02:40,557
Ask her what I did to her.

00:02:52,168 --> 00:02:53,642
(switchblade clicks open)

00:02:55,472 --> 00:02:57,642
Yeah.

00:02:57,642 --> 00:03:00,277
Ask.

00:03:12,956 --> 00:03:14,639
(panting)

00:03:21,564 --> 00:03:30,340
MAN:
Captain?
Cover the back.

00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,637

OFFICER (over radio): The
suspect's on the first floor.

00:04:43,246 --> 00:04:46,149
He's down.
Proceed with caution.

00:04:46,149 --> 00:04:47,283
You guys secure down here.

00:04:47,283 --> 00:04:48,251
I'm gonna head
up and join Brass.

00:04:48,251 --> 00:04:49,252
Got it.
Copy that.

00:04:49,252 --> 00:04:50,643
Gloria...
Mm?

00:04:50,643 --> 00:04:52,255
It's over.

00:04:52,255 --> 00:04:55,025
I'm not going
to leave you.

00:04:55,025 --> 00:04:57,193
Just gonna get you
to the hospital now.

00:04:59,262 --> 00:05:02,132
Everything's
going to be fine.

00:05:02,132 --> 00:05:04,134
Ray, listen to me.

00:05:04,134 --> 00:05:06,202
You don't say anything...

00:05:06,202 --> 00:05:08,644
to anyone, get it?

00:05:08,644 --> 00:05:11,307
Nothing, nobody.

00:05:19,382 --> 00:05:21,642
Mitch, Akers--
meet me out front?

00:05:21,642 --> 00:05:24,154
MITCHELL (over radio): Copy.
I have the car standing by.

00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:30,640
BRASS:
Put him in the car.

00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,638
Nobody talks to him.
That's an order.

00:05:32,638 --> 00:05:34,998
Yep. Got it, Captain.

00:05:40,203 --> 00:05:42,539
(siren approaching)

00:05:52,315 --> 00:05:54,184
OFFICER (over radio): This is
Metro holding Code Three

00:05:54,184 --> 00:05:56,086
to Desert Palm Hospital.

00:05:56,086 --> 00:05:57,520
Ray!

00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,265
SIDLE:
We chased Haskell from Vegas

00:06:09,265 --> 00:06:11,639
to L.A. and back
and end up finding him here.

00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:13,644
They always go home.
BRASS:
Home?!

00:06:13,644 --> 00:06:15,641
This house is owned
by Arvin Thorpe,

00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:17,639
the farmer
from across the street.

00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:20,641
Langston discovered
that Haskell's real name is

00:06:20,641 --> 00:06:22,112
Warner Thorpe.

00:06:22,112 --> 00:06:24,414
That makes Haskell
the farmer's son?

00:06:24,414 --> 00:06:25,635
The farmer must have been
lying to us.

00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,550
Well, he's still lying...

00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,085
upstairs with a bullet in him.

00:06:31,287 --> 00:06:33,641
Face up.

00:06:33,641 --> 00:06:36,192
Came through the banister
and landed here.

00:06:36,192 --> 00:06:37,260
Backwards.

00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,262
Took a beating beforehand.

00:06:39,262 --> 00:06:42,332
Blunt force trauma,
nose is broken.

00:06:42,332 --> 00:06:44,637
Thank God Ray's okay.

00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:46,336
They duked it out; Ray won.

00:06:46,336 --> 00:06:48,271
It's a classic case
of self-defense.

00:06:48,271 --> 00:06:51,007
We all know the
history of this.

00:06:51,007 --> 00:06:53,076
Internal Affairs is going to be
all over it.

00:06:53,076 --> 00:06:55,245
We need to give Ray
all the help we can.

00:06:55,245 --> 00:06:56,279
I'll be outside.

00:07:04,643 --> 00:07:06,638
"You never forget your first."

00:07:06,638 --> 00:07:09,425
Haskell left the same message
for Langston

00:07:09,425 --> 00:07:10,642
in Tina Vincent's room in L.A.

00:07:10,642 --> 00:07:13,637
Trail leads upstairs.

00:07:13,637 --> 00:07:15,064
Tickets to the fight.

00:07:15,064 --> 00:07:17,433
Ray was lured here.

00:07:17,433 --> 00:07:20,069
Haskell's house.
Home field advantage.

00:07:20,069 --> 00:07:22,272
I guess
Ray had more to fight for.

00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,175
WOMAN: Trauma's prepped
and ready, Doctor.

00:07:25,175 --> 00:07:28,344
You're going to be okay, Gloria.

00:07:28,344 --> 00:07:30,480
You hear me?

00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,641
You're gonna be just fine.

00:07:31,641 --> 00:07:33,283
You hear me?

00:07:34,317 --> 00:07:36,186
You're gonna be all right.

00:07:36,186 --> 00:07:38,154
Dr. Langston,
you have to let her go.

00:07:38,154 --> 00:07:41,424
I promise, we're going
to take good care of her.

00:07:41,424 --> 00:07:42,992
Ray...

00:07:42,992 --> 00:07:45,638
thank God you're all right.

00:07:45,638 --> 00:07:48,298
You know, I'd give you a hug
right now, but unfortunately,

00:07:48,298 --> 00:07:50,166
you're evidence, if
you know what I mean.

00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:51,367
I understand.
I understand.

00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,371
I need to be in there
with Gloria.

00:07:55,371 --> 00:07:57,006
Ray, we've got
to do this by the book.

00:07:58,308 --> 00:08:00,009
I'll process Gloria, and

00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:02,078
Nick will take
your clothes.

00:08:25,101 --> 00:08:26,644
You saved her life, Ray.

00:08:27,644 --> 00:08:29,405
That's all that matters.

00:08:36,644 --> 00:08:39,415
What is this?

00:08:43,553 --> 00:08:46,356
I don't know.

00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:49,425
(sighs)

00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:53,463
All right.

00:08:53,463 --> 00:08:55,965
I'm going to need your clothes
there, too, bud.

00:08:55,965 --> 00:08:58,134
All right.

00:09:00,644 --> 00:09:02,272
(sighs)

00:09:04,642 --> 00:09:06,175
ECKLIE:
<i>Jim?</i>

00:09:06,175 --> 00:09:07,639
I.A.'s already here.

00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:09,212
No, in your office.

00:09:09,212 --> 00:09:11,180
You still out
at the Thorpe house?

00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,016
Okay. No, no, no,
I'll handle it.

00:09:13,016 --> 00:09:14,284
I.A. works for me.

00:09:14,284 --> 00:09:18,454
Being boss should be good
for something. Yeah.

00:09:18,454 --> 00:09:20,556
Detective Schulz,

00:09:20,556 --> 00:09:23,126
Brass is, uh,
still out at the scene.

00:09:23,126 --> 00:09:24,637
Figure we could start
without him.

00:09:24,637 --> 00:09:25,962
Probably finish, too.

00:09:25,962 --> 00:09:27,363
This is all going
to be pretty straightforward.

00:09:27,363 --> 00:09:29,132
Always tricky
to estimate that, isn't it?

00:09:29,132 --> 00:09:31,637
Simpler these
officer-involved cases look,

00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:34,971
the more surprises
seem to pop up.

00:09:34,971 --> 00:09:37,040
I've seen plenty of claims
of self-defense turn out

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,309
to be cold-blooded murder
and a life sentence in Ely.

00:09:39,309 --> 00:09:41,311
When do I talk
to CSI Langston?

00:09:41,311 --> 00:09:43,643
Well, let's give the guy
a couple days.

00:09:43,643 --> 00:09:45,638
He's been through
the wringer in two cities...

00:09:45,638 --> 00:09:47,283
You saying you want to delay?

00:09:47,283 --> 00:09:50,019
We all want to put this to bed,
Detective, Langston included.

00:09:50,019 --> 00:09:52,455
Who wouldn't, in his situation?

00:09:52,455 --> 00:09:53,641
You'll get your interview.

00:09:53,641 --> 00:09:56,459
Thanks for coming in.

00:09:57,642 --> 00:10:00,163
Got it.

00:10:04,967 --> 00:10:07,970
So, Haskell traveled
approximately 132 inches.

00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:09,639
Let her rip, Dave.

00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:10,940
Yeah.

00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,209
(sighs)

00:10:13,209 --> 00:10:15,278
This wood is thick.

00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:17,113
Took a lot of force.

00:10:18,638 --> 00:10:21,117
(yelling)

00:10:26,289 --> 00:10:28,291
(yelling)

00:10:35,638 --> 00:10:37,567
Contusion on the back.

00:10:37,567 --> 00:10:40,470
Looks about the same width
as the railing.

00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:42,635
Guys like Haskell
don't go down easy.

00:10:47,636 --> 00:10:50,480
Single penetrating GSW
to Dad's head.

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,638
Multiple lacerations.

00:10:51,638 --> 00:10:54,517
Scabbed over.

00:10:54,517 --> 00:10:57,642
Dad took a beating at least
an hour before he died.

00:10:57,642 --> 00:11:01,491
Got a baker's dozen
of stab wounds to the abdomen.

00:11:03,459 --> 00:11:05,561
A lot of this blood

00:11:05,561 --> 00:11:07,463
could be explained
by Dad's injuries.

00:11:07,463 --> 00:11:08,642
Contributions
could be

00:11:08,642 --> 00:11:10,640
from Gloria
and Langston, too.

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,034
Some of it's got
to be from Haskell.

00:11:12,034 --> 00:11:15,972

You're going

to make it through this, Gloria.

00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,641
You survived.

00:14:07,641 --> 00:14:11,147
He's dead
and you're not.

00:14:11,147 --> 00:14:14,283
You beat him.

00:14:20,489 --> 00:14:22,491
Nine-mil.

00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,362
Gun Haskell used
to shoot Dad?

00:14:26,362 --> 00:14:28,598
And Tina Vincent
in L.A., I bet.

00:14:28,598 --> 00:14:30,466
It's empty.

00:14:30,466 --> 00:14:31,968
Only one round in Dad.

00:14:31,968 --> 00:14:34,971
Other shots fired at
Langston and Gloria?

00:14:34,971 --> 00:14:37,106
We can't talk to them until
after they talk to I.A.,

00:14:37,106 --> 00:14:40,636
but we can let
the walls talk,

00:14:40,636 --> 00:14:43,245
look for bullet holes,
cartridge casings.

00:14:51,387 --> 00:14:54,123
This wallpaper is
covering something.

00:14:56,225 --> 00:14:57,960
Old blood.

00:15:00,229 --> 00:15:01,998
It's kids' wallpaper.

00:15:01,998 --> 00:15:05,034
I think this was
Haskell's boyhood room.

00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:11,007
Yeah, there is
a lot of blood.

00:15:11,007 --> 00:15:13,643
Medium velocity,
heavier drops from castoff.

00:15:13,643 --> 00:15:16,045
Nate Haskell might have
died in this house,

00:15:16,045 --> 00:15:20,383
but I think a serial killer
was born in this room.

00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,639
(low, indistinct
police radio communication)

00:15:35,644 --> 00:15:38,000
So this is
where the S.O.B. grew up?

00:15:40,503 --> 00:15:42,204
First sample's

00:15:42,204 --> 00:15:43,372
not human.

00:15:43,372 --> 00:15:45,041
He did say
his first kill was a cat.

00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:47,638
Serials love to start
with animals,

00:15:47,638 --> 00:15:50,346
move on to human victims.

00:15:50,346 --> 00:15:53,637
You know, kids don't wallpaper
their own rooms.

00:15:53,637 --> 00:15:55,084
At the very least,

00:15:55,084 --> 00:15:57,636
Dad knew what his son
was up to in here.

00:15:57,636 --> 00:15:59,288
Maybe he was up
to it with him.

00:15:59,288 --> 00:16:00,635
He never called the cops.

00:16:00,635 --> 00:16:02,291
Maybe they shared hobbies.

00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,293
Langston might have been

00:16:04,293 --> 00:16:06,395
up against more
than one killer.

00:16:06,395 --> 00:16:09,365
SIDLE:<i>Greg's checking out</i>
<i>the master bedroom now.</i>

00:16:17,635 --> 00:16:20,639
The Thorpes didn't even paper
over the carnage in this room.

00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,278
They didn't even repaint it,

00:16:22,278 --> 00:16:25,636
just washed all
the blood away.

00:16:27,644 --> 00:16:29,952
Or so they thought.

00:16:29,952 --> 00:16:31,643
What the hell went on
in this house?

00:16:31,643 --> 00:16:33,189
Whatever it was,

00:16:33,189 --> 00:16:37,526
Arvin Thorpe didn't want
anyone poking around here.

00:16:37,526 --> 00:16:39,195
He bought
this house in 1958,

00:16:39,195 --> 00:16:42,635
listed it as his primary
residence until '76,

00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:45,644
when he bought the house across
the road and moved in there.

00:16:45,644 --> 00:16:49,038
Then lived there
till his last lying day.

00:16:49,038 --> 00:16:53,008
Yeah, but he never rented
this place out, never sold it.

00:16:53,008 --> 00:16:55,640
Guy like Arvin-- this property
was keeping all his secrets.

00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:59,381
All this old blood,
father and son killers--

00:16:59,381 --> 00:17:01,183
the more bodies we
find around here,

00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:03,644
the better it
is for Ray.

00:17:05,287 --> 00:17:06,956
Why don't you and Sara
keep working

00:17:06,956 --> 00:17:08,491
the current case analysis?

00:17:08,491 --> 00:17:10,126
I'll have Catherine
send me over some help.

00:17:10,126 --> 00:17:12,294
Floors, walls, basement, yard--

00:17:12,294 --> 00:17:14,396
I'm gonna rip
this hellhole apart.

00:17:15,498 --> 00:17:17,500
DOCTOR:
<i>Gloria is clearly suffering</i>

00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,642
acute traumatic stress--

00:17:19,642 --> 00:17:20,642
alert but not making
eye contact,

00:17:20,642 --> 00:17:22,204
not communicating.

00:17:22,204 --> 00:17:23,635
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm monitoring
for tachycardia.

00:17:23,635 --> 00:17:25,074
You do not talk
to him.

00:17:25,074 --> 00:17:29,011
He is not
her husband.

00:17:29,011 --> 00:17:33,015
You do not talk to him
about my daughter.

00:17:33,015 --> 00:17:35,117
What did he tell you,
that he's a doctor, too?

00:17:35,117 --> 00:17:36,285
Well, he's not.

00:17:36,285 --> 00:17:38,636
He is nothing
to my daughter

00:17:38,636 --> 00:17:41,023
but the one responsible
for all of this.

00:17:41,023 --> 00:17:43,993
Mrs. Parkes, why don't we
take this somewhere...?
Get security

00:17:43,993 --> 00:17:47,029
and get him out of here.

00:17:47,029 --> 00:17:49,465
He's the one
that did this to her.

00:17:49,465 --> 00:17:52,635
He's the one that brought
this monster into her life.

00:17:52,635 --> 00:17:55,642
You did this to her.

00:17:55,642 --> 00:17:57,573
Nora...
Go!

00:17:57,573 --> 00:17:59,942
Get out of my sight.

00:18:08,384 --> 00:18:12,555
I am taking my daughter
back to Baltimore with me.

00:18:12,555 --> 00:18:15,224
I have already arranged
the transportation.

00:18:15,224 --> 00:18:16,640
Let's talk about
the best timetable...

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,644
I am taking
my daughter home!

00:18:21,644 --> 00:18:25,067
Got the DNA reports
from all the blood

00:18:25,067 --> 00:18:27,641
we sampled
in the hallway.

00:18:27,641 --> 00:18:29,642
I figure
we color-code

00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:31,638
each of the blood donors.

00:18:33,275 --> 00:18:36,637
Blue for Langston,
green for Gloria,

00:18:36,637 --> 00:18:38,635
orange for Arvin Thorpe.

00:18:38,635 --> 00:18:40,644
And Haskell's
yellow-- perfect.

00:19:05,507 --> 00:19:09,044
♪ ♪

00:19:12,147 --> 00:19:14,984
It's almost all
Haskell's blood.

00:19:14,984 --> 00:19:17,519
You collected a chunk
of Haskell's scalp

00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:19,355
with a hair from right here.

00:19:19,355 --> 00:19:22,591
Blood spatter from Haskell on
the adjacent section of wall.

00:19:22,591 --> 00:19:24,642
Langston had Haskell
on his back.

00:19:24,642 --> 00:19:27,644
<i>Ground or pounded his head</i>
<i>into the floor.</i>

00:19:27,644 --> 00:19:29,644
SANDERS:
<i>So Ray got a few good blows in.</i>

00:19:32,468 --> 00:19:34,635
Just because Langston had
Haskell on the floor

00:19:34,635 --> 00:19:36,635
doesn't mean that he had him
under control.

00:19:37,637 --> 00:19:40,175
Langston's
shoe prints

00:19:40,175 --> 00:19:41,510
in Haskell's blood

00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:43,012
heading to the spot
where Haskell went

00:19:43,012 --> 00:19:44,446
through the
banister?

00:19:44,446 --> 00:19:46,348
Stomping through blood
that was already on the floor.

00:19:46,348 --> 00:19:47,349
Yeah, but it was

00:19:47,349 --> 00:19:48,984
only Langston's
shoe prints.

00:19:48,984 --> 00:19:50,185
Tangled up with Haskell,

00:19:50,185 --> 00:19:52,588
battling him
back towards the banister,

00:19:52,588 --> 00:19:55,157
Haskell would have stepped
into the same blood.

00:19:55,157 --> 00:19:57,593
Langston had him off his feet.

00:19:57,593 --> 00:19:59,528
He drove him
towards the banister.

00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:04,466
Maybe Haskell
still had

00:20:04,466 --> 00:20:06,969
the gun and jumped Langston.

00:20:06,969 --> 00:20:08,470
Langston did
what he had to do.

00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:09,972
He was fighting for his life.

00:20:09,972 --> 00:20:11,373
Greg, if, if we were talking

00:20:11,373 --> 00:20:13,175
about two anonymous people
locked in a fight...

00:20:13,175 --> 00:20:14,510
I'd still say it was a fight.

00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:15,641
Fights are
unpredictable,

00:20:15,641 --> 00:20:17,246
anything can happen.
Yeah, but
one person

00:20:17,246 --> 00:20:20,482
can utterly dominate the other,
have full control over them

00:20:20,482 --> 00:20:21,639
and throw them
to their death.

00:20:21,639 --> 00:20:22,643
I-I'm not saying
that that's what happened--

00:20:22,643 --> 00:20:25,187
and we both know
that Haskell was a monster--

00:20:25,187 --> 00:20:28,636
but we're looking
for the truth here...

00:20:28,636 --> 00:20:30,636
right?

00:20:37,433 --> 00:20:39,435
Any bodies yet?

00:20:39,435 --> 00:20:40,640
Hey.

00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,238
So far, just a few family pets
who lost the owner lottery--

00:20:43,238 --> 00:20:44,473
two cats and a dog,

00:20:44,473 --> 00:20:47,009
no collars, no way
to date 'em-- and these graves

00:20:47,009 --> 00:20:48,978
progress in size.

00:20:48,978 --> 00:20:51,644
I got a bad feeling
about a couple of those.

00:20:51,644 --> 00:20:53,048
I got something.

00:20:54,635 --> 00:20:56,218
Neither Rex nor Fluffy.

00:20:59,641 --> 00:21:02,157
ECKLIE:
It's human.

00:21:04,644 --> 00:21:06,644
You guys are going
to need a hand here.

00:21:06,644 --> 00:21:09,637
I've still got my kit in my car;
let me grab it.

00:21:11,567 --> 00:21:13,569
That's the spirit.

00:21:15,471 --> 00:21:17,573
CSI Willows.

00:21:17,573 --> 00:21:19,575
Detective, what
are you doing here?

00:21:19,575 --> 00:21:21,644
Paying my respects;
surprised I was the first one.

00:21:21,644 --> 00:21:24,639
Is that your unofficial way of
asking for my team's report?

00:21:24,639 --> 00:21:26,515
I can make it official.

00:21:26,515 --> 00:21:27,639
You will get it
when we're done

00:21:27,639 --> 00:21:29,284
processing
all the evidence.

00:21:29,284 --> 00:21:30,386
We've been down
this road before--

00:21:30,386 --> 00:21:31,636
Warrick Brown,
now Ray Langston.

00:21:31,636 --> 00:21:32,638
I talked to LAPD.

00:21:32,638 --> 00:21:33,642
Your guy bought a gun.

00:21:33,642 --> 00:21:35,024
For all I know,
he slapped around

00:21:35,024 --> 00:21:36,325
Tina Vincent.

00:21:36,325 --> 00:21:38,060
I don't think he'd hesitate
to kill Nate Haskell.

00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:40,095
I think you're getting
ahead of the evidence.

00:21:40,095 --> 00:21:41,263
Well, I'm ahead
of you.

00:21:41,263 --> 00:21:43,298
See for yourself.

00:21:48,638 --> 00:21:51,206
Your friend Schulz
was just here.

00:21:51,206 --> 00:21:53,142
Yeah, I had the pleasure.

00:21:53,142 --> 00:21:55,344
So what do we have?

00:21:55,344 --> 00:21:58,047
Well, Dad here was
maybe Haskell's

00:21:58,047 --> 00:22:00,049
one justifiable murder.

00:22:00,049 --> 00:22:02,635
Haskell had long-
healed bone traumas--

00:22:02,635 --> 00:22:06,021
ribs, fibula, tibia,
spiral breaks--

00:22:06,021 --> 00:22:07,489
indicative
of childhood abuse.

00:22:07,489 --> 00:22:09,637
But his father didn't
put him on this table.

00:22:09,637 --> 00:22:10,638
Langston did.

00:22:10,638 --> 00:22:12,227
Catherine, if it
were my wife

00:22:12,227 --> 00:22:14,229
tied up in that room,
I'll tell you...

00:22:14,229 --> 00:22:15,531
Doc, I get it.

00:22:15,531 --> 00:22:17,533
But is that how you think
Schulz is going to look at this?

00:22:17,533 --> 00:22:19,601
Ray killed someone.

00:22:19,601 --> 00:22:22,643
I need to know it was
the only way, the right way.

00:22:22,643 --> 00:22:24,635
Tell me there's something
on this body

00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:26,635
that's going
to make this case.

00:22:26,635 --> 00:22:29,642
Okay. Nate Haskell
died as a result

00:22:29,642 --> 00:22:32,014
of atlanto-occipital
disarticulation,

00:22:32,014 --> 00:22:35,451
consistent with his position
of impact on the stairs.

00:22:35,451 --> 00:22:38,420
Prior to death, he endured
multiple blunt force traumas

00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,055
to his face and body

00:22:40,055 --> 00:22:42,124
as you would see in a
serious fist fight.

00:22:42,124 --> 00:22:43,425
Well, Haskell fell

00:22:43,425 --> 00:22:45,644
backwards through the railing,
and landed on his back.

00:22:45,644 --> 00:22:47,563
How did he shatter his knee?

00:22:47,563 --> 00:22:50,599
Could be from the fall,
could be from the fight.

00:22:52,301 --> 00:22:54,643
And the kidney
is severely damaged.

00:22:54,643 --> 00:22:56,644
Is that from the fall, too?

00:22:56,644 --> 00:22:58,640
Or the fight?

00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,375
Either way, I'd call
it karma, wouldn't you?

00:23:00,375 --> 00:23:02,077
Doc, my opinion is not what

00:23:02,077 --> 00:23:04,079
we should be
worried about right now.

00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:06,515
(sighs)

00:23:06,515 --> 00:23:10,219
I found a couple of marks on
his wrists that I can't explain.

00:23:10,219 --> 00:23:11,587
Is this from the handcuffs?

00:23:11,587 --> 00:23:13,122
Not consistent with Brass's

00:23:13,122 --> 00:23:15,424
two-rail metal cuffs that were
on the body when I received it.

00:23:15,424 --> 00:23:20,262
Okay, so, Haskell was cuffed
or bound by something else.

00:23:20,262 --> 00:23:22,564
By someone else.

00:23:22,564 --> 00:23:24,366
Did Schulz see this?

00:23:24,366 --> 00:23:26,001
I'll tell what I told Schulz.

00:23:26,001 --> 00:23:28,636
These marks, the knee,
the kidney damage--

00:23:28,636 --> 00:23:32,074
none of it affects the
conclusions of my C.O.D.

00:23:32,074 --> 00:23:34,510
I'm going to go
get some air.

00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,640
(sighs)

00:23:57,533 --> 00:24:00,102
Gloria's SAE report came in.

00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:05,643
It's on the table, but you don't
want to look at that, Ray.

00:24:11,413 --> 00:24:13,637
I need to, Catherine.

00:24:34,336 --> 00:24:36,271
(whimpering)

00:24:38,637 --> 00:24:40,275
(whimpering)

00:24:43,545 --> 00:24:44,546
(whimpering)

00:24:50,152 --> 00:24:52,554
(sighs)

00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,533
(inhales, exhales)

00:25:04,533 --> 00:25:07,369
(indistinct radio communication,
camera shutter clicking)

00:25:08,635 --> 00:25:11,039
ECKLIE:
Small mandible, wide pelvis.

00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:12,639
Adult female.

00:25:12,639 --> 00:25:14,576
Color matches
the surrounding dirt.

00:25:14,576 --> 00:25:16,545
She's been here
at least a decade.

00:25:17,546 --> 00:25:19,281
STOKES:
Skull's crushed in.

00:25:19,281 --> 00:25:21,116
That's not really
Haskell's style.

00:25:21,116 --> 00:25:22,551
Killer's style develops.

00:25:22,551 --> 00:25:25,053
This may be
an early rough draft.

00:25:25,053 --> 00:25:27,256
What do you got, David?

00:25:29,291 --> 00:25:31,526
Adult male.

00:25:33,095 --> 00:25:34,596
SANDERS:
Polyester?

00:25:34,596 --> 00:25:36,638
'70s, maybe?

00:25:36,638 --> 00:25:38,500
ECKLIE:
Pockets are empty.

00:25:39,568 --> 00:25:41,970
STOKES:
Supra Lux. What's that?

00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:44,640
My grandma had a pink oven
with that logo on it.

00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,275
Wait a sec.

00:25:46,275 --> 00:25:48,277
Long before
point-and-click shopping,

00:25:48,277 --> 00:25:50,445
even before washed-up celebs
hawked skin cream

00:25:50,445 --> 00:25:53,048
on late-night TV,
sales was a ground war,

00:25:53,048 --> 00:25:54,637
and the foot soldiers

00:25:54,637 --> 00:25:56,084
were traveling salesmen.

00:25:56,084 --> 00:25:58,639
Sometimes, to show you just
how cool their product was,

00:25:58,639 --> 00:26:00,956
salesmen would come knocking
at your door armed with

00:26:00,956 --> 00:26:03,392
a salesman's sample.

00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,559
A little, semi-working model

00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:05,961
of the product.

00:26:07,262 --> 00:26:08,643
Supra-Lux.

00:26:08,643 --> 00:26:11,033
I noticed it when we
were in here earlier.

00:26:11,033 --> 00:26:14,136
So, you think some time in
the late '70s, a salesman

00:26:14,136 --> 00:26:15,570
knocks on this door,
and Nate Haskell,

00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:18,073
or Warner Thorpe, kills him,

00:26:18,073 --> 00:26:21,009
and then takes this little toy
fridge as his first souvenir?

00:26:21,009 --> 00:26:23,643
Yeah, only he didn't
just take his model.

00:26:26,381 --> 00:26:28,183
He took his name.

00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:38,636
(camera shutter clicking)

00:26:47,336 --> 00:26:48,639
Hey, Doc.
Hey.

00:26:48,639 --> 00:26:52,307
So... this is

00:26:52,307 --> 00:26:54,443
Douglas Nathan Haskell,
reported missing

00:26:54,443 --> 00:26:57,512
in 1976, by his wife Elaine.

00:26:57,512 --> 00:27:00,115
He was on a Supra-Lux sales
swing through Southern Nevada.

00:27:00,115 --> 00:27:03,285
DNA is a match to some
of the old blood we found

00:27:03,285 --> 00:27:05,087
in Nate's childhood bedroom.

00:27:05,087 --> 00:27:06,642
We were also able
to recover DNA

00:27:06,642 --> 00:27:09,257
off of our female
skeleton's molar.

00:27:09,257 --> 00:27:11,460
And as you can see there,
we ran that.

00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:14,229
Hey.

00:27:14,229 --> 00:27:15,364
Hey.

00:27:17,065 --> 00:27:20,969
So, all of these were
found in his backyard.

00:27:20,969 --> 00:27:23,505
Whoa. All right,
who are they?

00:27:23,505 --> 00:27:25,073
This one gave him his name.

00:27:26,637 --> 00:27:28,276
This one gave him life.

00:27:28,276 --> 00:27:29,640
Mother.
Yeah.

00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,637
That's Lois Thorpe.
She worked as an aid

00:27:31,637 --> 00:27:33,382
in an elementary school.

00:27:33,382 --> 00:27:36,218
One day in 1968, she just
didn't show up for work.

00:27:36,218 --> 00:27:38,644
So, the principal called
the police, filed a report.

00:27:38,644 --> 00:27:40,635
Arvin said she ran off.

00:27:40,635 --> 00:27:43,525
Multiple fractures
to her skull.

00:27:43,525 --> 00:27:45,394
Healed sternal fractures.

00:27:45,394 --> 00:27:47,642
Posterior rib fractures.

00:27:47,642 --> 00:27:50,432
Beaten to death
after a long prelude of abuse.

00:27:50,432 --> 00:27:52,200
STOKES:
She's a DNA match

00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,503
to blood we found
in the Thorpe master bedroom.

00:27:54,503 --> 00:27:56,438
Now, if she died in 1968,

00:27:56,438 --> 00:27:58,641
the boy would have only been
eight years old?

00:27:58,641 --> 00:28:01,276
And incapable of beating
his mother to death.

00:28:01,276 --> 00:28:03,078
So, Father killed Mother.

00:28:03,078 --> 00:28:06,581
STOKES:<i>The wall spattered</i>
<i>with the</i>mom's blood was right

00:28:06,581 --> 00:28:09,084
<i>on the other side</i>
<i>of the little boy's room,</i>

00:28:09,084 --> 00:28:11,644
<i>so he had to have heard</i>
<i>those beatings over</i>

00:28:11,644 --> 00:28:14,122
<i>and over again.</i>

00:28:14,122 --> 00:28:17,492
(thudding, angry grunting,
mother whimpering)

00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,597
ROBBINS:
These animal skeletons
exhibit a mix

00:28:22,597 --> 00:28:24,644
of violent method.
Some of the skeletons

00:28:24,644 --> 00:28:28,937
complete, unharmed,
possibly suffocation deaths.

00:28:28,937 --> 00:28:32,574
The others-- their bones
crushed into tiny pieces.

00:28:32,574 --> 00:28:34,976
Standard
serial killer evolution.

00:28:34,976 --> 00:28:37,312
In 1976, he graduated
to humans.

00:28:37,312 --> 00:28:41,635
At 16 years old, Warner Thorpe
meets Douglas Nathan Haskell,

00:28:41,635 --> 00:28:42,984
a traveling appliance salesman.

00:28:47,155 --> 00:28:48,638
Hello.

00:28:54,095 --> 00:28:58,640
STOKES:
<i>Soon after, Warner Thorpe just</i>
<i>stopped showing up for school.</i>

00:29:06,241 --> 00:29:09,544
And Nate Haskell is unleashed
on the world.

00:29:09,544 --> 00:29:11,246
WILLOWS:
<i>I.A. is on our ass.</i>

00:29:11,246 --> 00:29:12,581
They want the report.

00:29:12,581 --> 00:29:14,950
Do we know what happened
between Langston and Haskell?

00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:16,451
Well...

00:29:16,451 --> 00:29:19,221
um...

00:29:19,221 --> 00:29:22,641
the blood evidence says that
Langston dominated in the fight.

00:29:22,641 --> 00:29:24,159
He had Haskell on his back.

00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:26,595
He even had him off his feet
at one point.

00:29:26,595 --> 00:29:28,096
He carried him to the banister.

00:29:28,096 --> 00:29:29,531
So, reasonably,

00:29:29,531 --> 00:29:31,640
Langston should have been able
to subdue him,

00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,568
to restrain him, to cuff him.

00:29:35,403 --> 00:29:38,139
There were marks
on Haskell's wrists.

00:29:38,139 --> 00:29:42,210
I compared the abrasions to the
department-issued flex-cuffs.

00:29:44,012 --> 00:29:46,642
Are you suggesting
that Langston cuffed Haskell,

00:29:46,642 --> 00:29:50,644
shoved him through the railing,
and then cut the restraints off?

00:29:50,644 --> 00:29:54,639
Greg and I didn't find
any flex-cuffs at the scene.

00:29:54,639 --> 00:29:56,638
Well, the banister left
a continuous

00:29:56,638 --> 00:29:59,494
and unbroken contusion
across Haskell's back,

00:29:59,494 --> 00:30:01,530
so his arms weren't
behind his back.

00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:03,331
There was nothing between

00:30:03,331 --> 00:30:06,268
that banister and his back
when he hit it.

00:30:06,268 --> 00:30:08,537
Suggests he
wasn't cuffed.

00:30:08,537 --> 00:30:10,472
There is another possibility.

00:30:10,472 --> 00:30:13,108
Langston could have cut
the cuffs off Haskell

00:30:13,108 --> 00:30:15,644
before throwing him
through the railing.

00:30:15,644 --> 00:30:17,579
There were no cuffs
found at the scene.

00:30:17,579 --> 00:30:20,248
And if we let the evidence
speak, it's telling us,

00:30:20,248 --> 00:30:24,519
no cuffs present, no cuffs used.

00:30:35,639 --> 00:30:37,643
Mrs. Parkes?

00:30:37,643 --> 00:30:40,168
I'm Catherine Willows
with the Crime Lab.

00:30:40,168 --> 00:30:41,970
You work with Ray.

00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:43,572
Yes.

00:30:43,572 --> 00:30:44,644
What are you doing here?

00:30:44,644 --> 00:30:48,009
I'm the one that
processed your daughter

00:30:48,009 --> 00:30:50,345
when she arrived here.

00:30:50,345 --> 00:30:52,013
I just wanted to check
on how she's doing.

00:30:52,013 --> 00:30:55,644
You want to ask her questions,
you want her to relive it.

00:30:55,644 --> 00:30:57,552
That's what
you people do.

00:30:57,552 --> 00:31:01,389
Well, she's not talking,
so please, just go.

00:31:01,389 --> 00:31:03,639
Mrs. Parkes, my job is not

00:31:03,639 --> 00:31:07,228
to make anyone relive
their nightmares, but

00:31:07,228 --> 00:31:10,131
sometimes I'm left
with a few questions.

00:31:10,131 --> 00:31:14,235
I just need a minute
with Gloria.

00:31:14,235 --> 00:31:17,038
Eight years old.

00:31:18,273 --> 00:31:20,636
She made a list of all
the big places

00:31:20,636 --> 00:31:22,544
she was going to play music.

00:31:22,544 --> 00:31:25,013
And she made it
all come true.

00:31:26,381 --> 00:31:28,640
She could have done
anything she wanted.

00:31:34,422 --> 00:31:36,958
Do you know why
their marriage ended?

00:31:36,958 --> 00:31:41,262
Because Ray was afraid
to have a baby with her.

00:31:41,262 --> 00:31:43,431
Not just nerves.

00:31:43,431 --> 00:31:47,638
Fear that something bad
inside him

00:31:47,638 --> 00:31:50,071
would be passed on.

00:31:50,071 --> 00:31:53,341
That man has always scared me.

00:31:55,276 --> 00:31:57,445
Doesn't he scare you?

00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,197
Gloria?
Mm.

00:32:16,197 --> 00:32:18,033
I just wanted to ask...

00:32:20,301 --> 00:32:23,938
...if you were doing okay.

00:32:24,973 --> 00:32:27,639
I'm tired.

00:32:29,444 --> 00:32:31,513
(quietly):
I'm tired.

00:32:31,513 --> 00:32:33,548
I understand.

00:32:33,548 --> 00:32:35,642
I'll let you rest.
Mm.

00:32:40,638 --> 00:32:42,157
Thank you.

00:32:54,135 --> 00:32:56,104
What are you doing?

00:32:58,006 --> 00:32:59,441
Isn't that Langston's kit?

00:32:59,441 --> 00:33:01,640
There were marks
on Haskell's wrists.

00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,641
They look like flex-cuffs.

00:33:03,641 --> 00:33:07,015
So now you're checking to see
if his kit is still stocked

00:33:07,015 --> 00:33:09,017
with three
department-issue cuffs?

00:33:09,017 --> 00:33:10,952
Yep.

00:33:14,489 --> 00:33:16,491
What if it was me?

00:33:17,392 --> 00:33:18,642
My kit?

00:33:18,642 --> 00:33:20,636
I'd open it.

00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:24,299
We have all had
our moment in the dark

00:33:24,299 --> 00:33:25,644
where we had to fight
our way out,

00:33:25,644 --> 00:33:28,203
and when we did, it was
up to the rest of the team

00:33:28,203 --> 00:33:29,640
to shine a light
onto that darkness

00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,638
to see what happened.

00:33:31,638 --> 00:33:32,644
That's our job.

00:33:34,442 --> 00:33:39,080
I just need to know
what I'm dealing with

00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,416
and then I will deal with it.

00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,067
Three cuffs.

00:34:00,034 --> 00:34:01,936
Satisfied?

00:34:06,975 --> 00:34:08,977
That the report
for I.A.?

00:34:10,111 --> 00:34:12,347
That took longer
than I expected.

00:34:12,347 --> 00:34:13,642
There was a question
about whether Langston

00:34:13,642 --> 00:34:16,639
might have used flex-
cuffs on Haskell.

00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,186
And?

00:34:18,186 --> 00:34:20,555
Greg and Sara didn't find any
at the scene,

00:34:20,555 --> 00:34:24,125
but you were
the first responder.

00:34:25,126 --> 00:34:27,595
Is that a question?

00:34:27,595 --> 00:34:28,637
I didn't see

00:34:28,637 --> 00:34:31,266
any mention of flex-cuffs
in your report.

00:34:31,266 --> 00:34:33,635
No, you didn't.

00:34:33,635 --> 00:34:36,137
I presume Ray had
all three pairs in his kit.

00:34:36,137 --> 00:34:39,040
All three, yeah,
you've got quite a memory there.

00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,576
Know how to stock a kit.

00:34:45,446 --> 00:34:48,416
You have a problem,

00:34:48,416 --> 00:34:50,285
you have about five seconds
to spit it out.

00:34:50,285 --> 00:34:52,153
I look out
for my team.

00:34:52,153 --> 00:34:53,288
How about you?

00:34:53,288 --> 00:34:54,989
Now, are you going
to sign that or what?

00:34:54,989 --> 00:34:56,391
I already did.

00:34:56,391 --> 00:34:57,592
We all did.

00:34:58,635 --> 00:35:00,637
I made you a copy.

00:35:00,637 --> 00:35:02,363
Save you time.

00:35:02,363 --> 00:35:05,635
The evidence supports CSI
Langston acting in self-defense.

00:35:36,644 --> 00:35:38,967
If you care about her,
don't go in there.

00:35:41,169 --> 00:35:43,638
The doctor says
Gloria is okay

00:35:43,638 --> 00:35:45,638
to fly back
to Baltimore with me,

00:35:45,638 --> 00:35:48,042
and we're leaving
in the morning.

00:35:48,042 --> 00:35:49,577
She doesn't want
to talk about this.

00:35:49,577 --> 00:35:51,642
She wants to forget, and the
sight of you would just...

00:35:51,642 --> 00:35:55,016
I understand, Nora.

00:35:55,016 --> 00:35:57,644
I know I'm responsible for
what's happened to her.

00:35:57,644 --> 00:35:59,641
I'd like to try
and find a way

00:35:59,641 --> 00:36:01,644
to atone for it,
if I can.

00:36:04,492 --> 00:36:07,495
I know that we have
never liked each other.

00:36:07,495 --> 00:36:11,232
I've never understood
what Gloria saw in you, but...

00:36:11,232 --> 00:36:14,235
(sighs) ...what I said
to you earlier...

00:36:15,642 --> 00:36:20,441
It's not for me
to blame or judge you.

00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,640
That's okay, she'll do that.

00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,635
Well, she
can't speak

00:36:26,635 --> 00:36:29,250
for herself yet,

00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:31,252
so if that's the answer
you're looking for,

00:36:31,252 --> 00:36:35,156
you're going
to have to wait.

00:36:35,156 --> 00:36:38,644
She needs
to go home to heal.

00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:45,300
I hope you find peace, Ray.

00:36:57,641 --> 00:36:59,641
(phone vibrating)

00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:32,640
♪ ♪

00:37:41,289 --> 00:37:43,291
What are you
doing here?

00:37:45,026 --> 00:37:47,295
You know, it's weird, I...
I just got off the phone

00:37:47,295 --> 00:37:48,296
with the police officer

00:37:48,296 --> 00:37:49,530
in the black-and-white
across the street.

00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:51,532
He's looking out
for trespassers.

00:37:51,532 --> 00:37:52,638
He's wrangling
these crime geeks

00:37:52,638 --> 00:37:54,969
who want to spend a night
in the House of Haskell.

00:37:54,969 --> 00:37:57,472
Now, that wouldn't
be you, would it?

00:38:02,443 --> 00:38:04,212
You killed a murderer
in self-defense.

00:38:04,212 --> 00:38:06,214
You get that, right?

00:38:09,183 --> 00:38:12,053
I get that, uh,

00:38:12,053 --> 00:38:14,389
I did everything I
could do for Gloria.

00:38:20,361 --> 00:38:24,532
Look, Jim, I knew what
I was walking into.

00:38:28,036 --> 00:38:31,339
Nice to see you leading
this dance finally, Ray.

00:38:31,339 --> 00:38:35,209
I can feel your
pulse, Nate.

00:38:35,209 --> 00:38:36,377
Feel your heart beating.

00:38:36,377 --> 00:38:38,012
(weakly):
Can you...?

00:38:38,012 --> 00:38:39,113
(grunts)

00:38:39,113 --> 00:38:41,382
If I'd hit you a
moment earlier,

00:38:41,382 --> 00:38:43,351
just the upstroke of
your heartbeat's T-wave,

00:38:43,351 --> 00:38:44,644
I could have induced
commotio cordis,

00:38:44,644 --> 00:38:46,220
or instant death.

00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,639
But you didn't, Ray.

00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:49,640
This is a slow dance.

00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,637
You made sure of that.

00:38:51,637 --> 00:38:54,062
You spent a lifetime trying
to make me suffer...

00:38:54,062 --> 00:38:56,643
like you made a lot
of other people.

00:38:56,643 --> 00:38:58,199
(grunts)

00:38:58,199 --> 00:39:00,301
Scarred me for life!

00:39:00,301 --> 00:39:01,502
Took my kidney.

00:39:01,502 --> 00:39:03,639
Well, I'm gonna help
myself to one of yours.

00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:04,644
(grunting)

00:39:04,644 --> 00:39:06,441
Let it go.

00:39:06,441 --> 00:39:08,639
Let it out, Ray,
let it out!

00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:10,411
(laughing):
Let it out.

00:39:10,411 --> 00:39:12,113
There's still
more in you, Ray,

00:39:12,113 --> 00:39:13,514
still more
of me in there.

00:39:13,514 --> 00:39:17,635
There's a little bit
of me in her, too, Ray.

00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:23,157
I think I know where you
want to take me, Nate.

00:39:23,157 --> 00:39:24,992
But you know
something?

00:39:24,992 --> 00:39:27,095
I'm already there.

00:39:28,096 --> 00:39:30,364
(grunting)

00:39:30,364 --> 00:39:31,637
(screams)

00:39:31,637 --> 00:39:32,641
It's all right, Nate.

00:39:32,641 --> 00:39:34,469
It's all right,
It's all right.

00:39:34,469 --> 00:39:35,536
I'll take you the
rest of the way.

00:39:36,471 --> 00:39:38,573
(both yell)

00:39:39,644 --> 00:39:40,942
(thud)

00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:46,981
Look... we are the only
two people in the world

00:39:46,981 --> 00:39:49,317
who know what
really happened here,

00:39:49,317 --> 00:39:51,644
and this stays
between you and me

00:39:51,644 --> 00:39:53,287
'cause if I.A.
gets ahold of it,

00:39:53,287 --> 00:39:54,639
Internal Affairs is going
to kick this up

00:39:54,639 --> 00:39:55,639
to a criminal case.

00:39:55,639 --> 00:39:58,639
They'll try you
for murder, Ray,

00:39:58,639 --> 00:40:00,962
they'll lock you up,

00:40:00,962 --> 00:40:03,498
and it won't just be you
you'll be crucifying.

00:40:20,644 --> 00:40:22,016
What?

00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:25,019
I had white chalk
on my hands--

00:40:25,019 --> 00:40:27,121
transfer
from Gloria.

00:40:39,133 --> 00:40:40,968
Music notes.

00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,640
(cello playing)

00:41:14,168 --> 00:41:16,370
(giggles)

00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:17,637
"The Swan"

00:41:17,637 --> 00:41:19,640
by Saint-Saens.

00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:22,543
It's not really the story
for a first date...

00:41:22,543 --> 00:41:24,111
(laughs)

00:41:24,111 --> 00:41:27,949
...but, um...

00:41:27,949 --> 00:41:31,419
that piece of music...

00:41:31,419 --> 00:41:33,637
saved my life.

00:41:33,637 --> 00:41:36,524
Saved her life.

00:41:36,524 --> 00:41:38,326
She knew
you'd come back for her.

00:41:40,642 --> 00:41:42,642
You did
the right thing, brother.

00:41:52,173 --> 00:41:54,175
(Langston sighs)

00:41:57,644 --> 00:41:59,280
After everything
that's happened

00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,415
between the two of you,

00:42:01,415 --> 00:42:03,642
it's natural that you'd need
some reflection.

00:42:03,642 --> 00:42:06,639
Reflection.

00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:09,637
That's what he saw
when he looked at me.

00:42:09,637 --> 00:42:12,093
That's what he wanted
you to believe.

00:42:12,093 --> 00:42:15,196
He wanted to bring you
into that house with him.

00:42:15,196 --> 00:42:19,643
He wanted to make you a
helpless child, just like him,

00:42:19,643 --> 00:42:21,168
huddled against
that bedroom wall

00:42:21,168 --> 00:42:24,305
with nothing but terror
on the other side.

00:42:24,305 --> 00:42:28,276
My daddy was on the other side
of that wall in my house.

00:42:28,276 --> 00:42:30,639
The difference
between me

00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:33,147
and Nate Haskell is that
I decided to train myself

00:42:33,147 --> 00:42:36,450
to be good,
like other people.

00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:37,985
"Be good, Ray."

00:42:37,985 --> 00:42:39,487
Even scratched it
into my desk

00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:43,491
when I was little--
"be good."

00:42:43,491 --> 00:42:45,493
Be good.

00:42:46,644 --> 00:42:50,298
You<i>aregood.</i>

00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:59,639
SCHULZ:
<i>This is the formal interview</i>
<i>of CSI Raymond Langston...</i>

00:43:01,175 --> 00:43:03,637
<i>...with regard to the incident</i>
<i>resulting in the death</i>

00:43:03,637 --> 00:43:07,481
<i>of Warner Thorpe,</i>
<i>aka Nate Haskell.</i>

00:43:09,641 --> 00:43:12,219
<i>CSI Langston has been informed</i>
<i>of his administrative rights</i>

00:43:12,219 --> 00:43:15,089
<i>and understands the nature</i>
<i>of this investigation.</i>

00:43:17,091 --> 00:43:19,327
We will commence
with CSI Langston's account

00:43:19,327 --> 00:43:20,636
of the facts in this case...

00:43:20,636 --> 00:43:24,639
The fact is...
that I killed a man.

00:43:25,639 --> 00:43:28,369
That's why you're here.

00:43:28,369 --> 00:43:30,504
Question is:
how did you kill him?

00:43:31,505 --> 00:43:34,542
Was it self-defense...

00:43:34,542 --> 00:43:36,577
or murder?
