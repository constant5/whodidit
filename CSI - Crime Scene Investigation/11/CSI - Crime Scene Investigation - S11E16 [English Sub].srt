Maybe he was
intoxicated.

was a man named Dr. Eliot
Davis Aden.

00:10:02,212 --> 00:10:04,004
"EDA."

00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:06,208
This probably belonged to him.

00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:08,041
He's an interesting guy.

00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,212
World-renowned psychoanalyst,

00:10:10,212 --> 00:10:12,214
but fell down the rabbit hole
of psychedelic drugs.

00:10:12,214 --> 00:10:15,015
Was dismissed
by the scientific community,

00:10:15,015 --> 00:10:17,210
but not without
one big, fat scandal.

00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:19,119
Rumor has it that Dr. Aden

00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:21,121
had become a bit
of a Dr. Feelgood

00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,213
for the student body.

00:10:22,213 --> 00:10:24,925
At least until one of his
students threw himself out

00:10:24,925 --> 00:10:27,727
of a fifth-story window,
and the party came to an end.

00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:29,207
He was banished by
the university,

00:10:29,207 --> 00:10:30,697
but charges
were never pressed.

00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:32,732
So the government didn't want
to step on the toes

00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:33,967
of someone who
knew their secrets.

00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,903
All right, so our morgue zombie
is walking around

00:10:36,903 --> 00:10:39,506
with Dr. Aden's notebook.
There's got to be a connection.

00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:40,740
Is Aden still around?

00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,943
He still receives a government
pension check.

00:10:42,943 --> 00:10:44,208
And I was able to track down

00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,645
the address where
he receives it.

00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,614
Hello, Doctor.

00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:07,207
♪ ♪

00:11:27,754 --> 00:11:30,523
(knocking)

00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,526
MAN: Casino's three
miles further.

00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,961
Dr. Aden?

00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:38,205
Dr. Aden... Uh...
we'd like to speak with you.

00:11:38,205 --> 00:11:39,866
You got the wrong guy.

00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:42,669
We're from the crime lab.
We found something of yours.

00:11:47,209 --> 00:11:50,209
ADEN:
<i>Lying government bastards!</i>

00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,645
Ivory-tower turncoats!

00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:56,649
Frat boy plays window Icarus,
and the university throws

00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:59,953
my reputation out the window
with him.

00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:04,206
They claimed that all of
my papers had been destroyed.

00:12:04,206 --> 00:12:06,693
Banished me from
university property.

00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:10,096
It was a good way to cut me out
of the green<i>andthe glory.</i>

00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:13,211
It's Philo Farnsworth
all over again!

00:12:13,211 --> 00:12:15,213
I'm sorry.
Where did you find this?

00:12:15,213 --> 00:12:17,213
In the pocket of, uh,
this young man.

00:12:17,213 --> 00:12:18,772
Do you recognize him?

00:12:18,772 --> 00:12:22,214
Uh-uh... He's dead?

00:12:22,214 --> 00:12:25,205
He's obviously on
an autopsy table.

00:12:25,205 --> 00:12:28,213
Actually, the young man
in question...

00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:31,551
...arose.

00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:37,023
The Lazarus myth made real?

00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:42,205
Re-animation? This is
getting more interesting.

00:12:42,205 --> 00:12:43,563
It's, uh...

00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:46,699
not as easy as you might think,
bringing back the dead.

00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:48,209
It's not work for neophytes.

00:12:48,209 --> 00:12:50,770
Or the reckless.
Or the timid.

00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,605
Oh, sure,

00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,874
they can conjure up
a cardiac spasm,

00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:57,744
or a momentary flash from
the bioelectric system.

00:12:57,744 --> 00:12:59,846
That's not the same as...
Doctor,

00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:01,207
are you saying
that you conducted

00:13:01,207 --> 00:13:02,882
re-animation experiments
at Stonewall?

00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:04,551
What's your clearance, soldier?

00:13:04,551 --> 00:13:06,553
Uh...
about five-nine.

00:13:06,553 --> 00:13:07,921
Doctor, are those your notes

00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:09,208
from the re-animation
experiments?

00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:11,925
It's hard to say.

00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:13,860
It's my writing.

00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,930
I won a lot of awards for
penmanship in third grade.

00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:20,100
Of course, staying between
the lines for me wasn't easy.

00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:23,213
These... last entries.

00:13:23,213 --> 00:13:25,105
It's not my handwriting.

00:13:25,105 --> 00:13:26,806
Some vulture

00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:30,043
is perching on my
giant shoulders.

00:13:30,043 --> 00:13:33,780
Feasting on the carrion
of my discoveries.

00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,115
Treating the work as their own.

00:13:35,115 --> 00:13:37,050
In your, um, re-animation
experiments, Doctor,

00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,211
how far would you say

00:13:38,211 --> 00:13:40,120
you were able to get?

00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:44,791
I had the Ithaca of that
most profound mystery

00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,626
within my sights.

00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:50,063
Could almost reach
out and touch it.

00:13:50,063 --> 00:13:52,866
But I saw the storm
clouds gathering.

00:13:52,866 --> 00:13:54,213
The maelstrom.

00:13:54,213 --> 00:13:57,205
For those not wise enough
to pull their sails in,

00:13:57,205 --> 00:13:59,973
certain destruction awaits.

00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:03,212
I'm trying to say...
this isn't good.

00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:13,553
(laughing, conversing
indistinctly)

00:14:15,205 --> 00:14:16,890
San Francisco girl, huh?

00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,210
Left my heart,

00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:20,560
and half my cerebral
cortex in Frisco.

00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,862
You ever see The Dead
play the Fillmore?

00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,206
No, uh... too busy with
the dead everywhere else.

00:14:25,206 --> 00:14:26,533
Lucky you.

00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,214
LANGSTON:
The research librarian said

00:14:28,214 --> 00:14:30,737
that your work was archived

00:14:30,737 --> 00:14:33,205
in a disused wing
of one of the buildings,

00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,508
gave me the keys, but said
"enter at your own risk."

00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:37,010
Preface fit for any
worthwhile venture.

00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,210
Where is it?

00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,205
Lincoln Hall,
room 317.

00:14:40,205 --> 00:14:41,814
Right where I left it.

00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:43,816
Lazy, lying bastards!

00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:45,210
WILLOWS:
<i>I really don't know, Conrad.</i>

00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:47,211
Maybe we need a new
classification

00:14:47,211 --> 00:14:51,591
for this type of situation.
D.O.-AWOL.

00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:52,959
That was a joke!

00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,211
Hey, Catherine.
Later,
Conrad.

00:14:54,211 --> 00:14:57,797
I got a DMV facial recognition
match on the morgue zombie.

00:14:57,797 --> 00:14:59,866
Oh, Max Ferris.
Mm-hmm.

00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:02,769
Home address is on the WLVU
campus, so I called the school.

00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:04,212
He's a grad student
in psychology.

00:15:04,212 --> 00:15:05,939
Could be how he got
Aden's notebook.

00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:07,974
Yeah.
I'll have Brass send
a uniform to his place,

00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:10,207
trap his credit cards,
see if we can track him down.

00:15:10,207 --> 00:15:11,544
Nice.

00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,981
We don't need a key.
The lock's been busted out.

00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:16,209
Easy. Easy, Doctor.

00:15:16,209 --> 00:15:17,917
Easy, easy,
easy.

00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,552
We don't want to
tamper with this.

00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:21,554
This is all evidence.

00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,210
This...

00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:30,530
is my Library of Alexandria.

00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,966
My trove of treasures.

00:15:32,966 --> 00:15:35,208
I may have been banned bodily,

00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:38,938
but I wandered it
nightly in my dreams.

00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,641
Looks like someone's been doing
some independent study here.

00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:49,207
Doctor, are these...
all yourpapers?

00:15:49,207 --> 00:15:51,851
Do you know how many
papers I wrote?

00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,621
I'm asking.

00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:56,211
How about we get
back to you on that?

00:15:56,211 --> 00:15:57,557
Hmm.

00:15:57,557 --> 00:16:00,893
"Reflections On
Near-death Experiences."

00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:03,096
"Death As Gateway."

00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:05,164
That was my"WhiteAlbum."

00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:08,210
They all appear to be
on the same subject.

00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:12,939
Sooner or later, all us
chickens cross the road.

00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:15,942
Now, aren't we all curious
about what's on the other side?

00:16:15,942 --> 00:16:18,878
Hey, Doc.

00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:20,513
Your other subjects
look untouched.

00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:23,016
Whoever's been playing around
with your papers

00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:24,214
was only interested
in your research on

00:16:24,214 --> 00:16:26,619
death-related
phenomena.

00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:30,957
Making your acolyte's visit
to the morgue... what?

00:16:30,957 --> 00:16:32,213
A field trip?

00:16:32,213 --> 00:16:34,594
In all my journeys
to the other side,

00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:36,211
I never left
this building.

00:16:36,211 --> 00:16:38,064
DMT, ketamine,

00:16:38,064 --> 00:16:40,033
those were the only
tickets I needed.

00:16:40,033 --> 00:16:41,801
Hallucinogenic trips?

00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:43,936
Better than a ride
in a coroner's van?

00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:48,741
Where is it?

00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:52,145
Where isit?

00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:53,980
What have they
done to my song?

00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,982
Dr. Aden!

00:16:58,211 --> 00:17:02,021
BRASS: So, Captain Klepto,
you don't look like Max Ferris.

00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,557
Guy was passed out
on the sidewalk.

00:17:04,557 --> 00:17:05,892
A real eyesore.

00:17:05,892 --> 00:17:07,206
So it's your
civic duty

00:17:07,206 --> 00:17:08,761
to steal his wallet,
take his cash,

00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:10,206
and swipe his credit card?

00:17:10,206 --> 00:17:12,899
I had that plastic for a whole
day. I only used it once.

00:17:12,899 --> 00:17:15,205
For a six-pack of beer, so...

00:17:15,205 --> 00:17:17,103
Cleaning up the streets
<i>andfiscally responsible.</i>

00:17:17,103 --> 00:17:18,212
You ought to run for office.

00:17:18,212 --> 00:17:19,605
Look out,
Mayor Goodman.

00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:22,210
Hey, I gave you his
wallet and his...

00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:24,510
phone...thing.
What are the odds

00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,579
you'll just cut
me loose, huh?

00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,047
This is a phone?

00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,205
Didn't look like any phone
I'd seen, either.

00:17:30,205 --> 00:17:32,518
But I'm a couple
iPhones behind.

00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:33,686
Yeah, I'll bet you are.

00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:34,921
JOHNSON:
<i>It's not a phone.</i>

00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:37,857
It's a wearable camcorder.

00:17:37,857 --> 00:17:40,205
Wireless video camera
and receiver.

00:17:40,205 --> 00:17:41,894
Our morgue zombie
was using it.

00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:45,064
Well, grab some popcorn.

00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:49,213
Tonight, we take
the ultimate step.

00:17:49,213 --> 00:17:52,210
Beyond our past journeys
of the mind.

00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:54,006
Tonight, we free ourselves

00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:56,208
from the physical plane.

00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,977
Unspooling the mortal coil,

00:17:57,977 --> 00:18:00,210
we seek the mystery
that lies beyond...

00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:02,014
Hey, Discovery Channel,

00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:04,150
kill the speech and let's
kill some brain cells.

00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:06,786
This guy on the left-- his
clothing matches the description

00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:07,954
of our alley zombie.

00:18:07,954 --> 00:18:10,089
It's a dead man's party.

00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,924
Except the third person
looks like a woman.

00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,210
DR. ADEN:
<i>How could they do this?</i>

00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:14,727
What have
they done?

00:18:14,727 --> 00:18:17,029
If they've given it to
some health club...

00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:19,132
Dr. Aden, slow down.

00:18:19,132 --> 00:18:21,214
Dude. You going to tell us
what we're taking?

00:18:21,214 --> 00:18:24,003
FERRIS:
No need to add baggage
to your trip.

00:18:24,003 --> 00:18:25,214
Trust me, Kurt.

00:18:25,214 --> 00:18:26,806
It's going to be an adventure.

00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:30,076
It's time
to put your cameras on.

00:18:30,076 --> 00:18:32,078
See you on re-entry.

00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:36,949
Godspeed, Alice.

00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:42,822
WILLOWS:
Max's friends Kurt and Alice.

00:18:42,822 --> 00:18:45,210
Maybe we can get access to Max's
university email account;

00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:46,210
check his contacts.

00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,593
See who his co-pilots were.

00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:49,095
Yeah.

00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:02,508
Angelfish. Triggerfish.

00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:05,210
Blue-ringed octopus.

00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:07,210
All poisonous.

00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:08,981
All alive.

00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:12,211
Someone has been in here
on a regular basis.

00:19:12,211 --> 00:19:14,214
FERRIS:
20 minutes after ingestion.

00:19:14,214 --> 00:19:17,214
Effects are manifesting.

00:19:17,214 --> 00:19:20,214
(sighs)

00:19:20,214 --> 00:19:22,028
So Max has made his way

00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:26,065
to the Strip.
He's at the plaza
by the Tangiers.

00:19:26,065 --> 00:19:29,206
Increasing numbness
of the mouth.

00:19:29,206 --> 00:19:33,172
S... Speech is becoming
difficult.

00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:37,214
Numbness spreading.

00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:41,914
That hum.

00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:44,517
The fish tank filter.

00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,519
No, no, it's another harmonic.

00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:03,212
She's here!

00:20:03,212 --> 00:20:04,704
Oh, my...

00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:07,039
<i>Santa Maria,my</i>Nautilus!

00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:11,207
The vessel of all my dreams.

00:20:11,207 --> 00:20:15,147
Dr. Aden!

00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:17,083
SARA:
That's not Max Ferris.

00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,651
That's our alley zombie.

00:20:18,651 --> 00:20:20,553
De-animated.

00:20:29,205 --> 00:20:30,630
The good doctor is content

00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,207
to wait in the hall.
He hasn't had

00:20:32,207 --> 00:20:33,533
this much excitement
since Altamont.

00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:34,867
Or so he says.

00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:36,212
Police and coroners
are on their way.

00:20:36,212 --> 00:20:38,905
Pulled the victim's wallet.
Kurt Dawson.

00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:40,907
Lived near campus,

00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:43,042
but his student ID expired
about a year ago.

00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:44,212
Dropped out of school.

00:20:44,212 --> 00:20:46,209
Or dropped out
of reality.

00:20:46,209 --> 00:20:47,813
A sensory deprivation tank.

00:20:49,205 --> 00:20:52,051
Did you ever see that movie
<i>Altered States?</i>

00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:53,586
Oh. Yeah.
My mom took me.

00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:56,206
She found it
therapeutic, calming.

00:20:56,206 --> 00:20:57,823
Says it all.

00:20:57,823 --> 00:21:00,760
I saw it with some
really good buds.
Go, Dr. Ray.

00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,662
I know. I only talk
like a square.

00:21:02,662 --> 00:21:06,206
Tank water's highly salinated;
kept at body temp

00:21:06,206 --> 00:21:08,601
so the user floats

00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:10,870
in complete silence
and darkness.

00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,972
Blocking out all
earthly stimuli.

00:21:14,974 --> 00:21:17,143
You know, in the movie
<i>Altered States,</i>

00:21:17,143 --> 00:21:19,078
William Hurt went
into the tank naked.

00:21:19,078 --> 00:21:21,213
To strip the self down
to one's primitive,

00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:22,982
disembodied being

00:21:22,982 --> 00:21:24,784
is how you free the
mind, allowing it

00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:26,206
to venture
into other realms.

00:21:26,206 --> 00:21:27,620
You wouldn't want
to go venturing

00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,207
in ten pounds of
wet clothes and sneakers.

00:21:30,214 --> 00:21:33,206
Maybe the tank
wasn't his idea.

00:21:33,206 --> 00:21:36,095
ROBBINS:
I noticed some faint bruising
that started to develop

00:21:36,095 --> 00:21:37,530
on Kurt's back and shoulder.

00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:40,212
So, I snapped
some infrared photos.

00:21:40,212 --> 00:21:42,101
Hand marks.
He was held down.

00:21:42,101 --> 00:21:44,971
That's one way to drown in
just ten inches of water.

00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:46,772
So drowning is COD?

00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:48,209
Heavy, edematous lungs,

00:21:48,209 --> 00:21:51,644
and fluid in his sphenoid sinus
make it pretty clear.

00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:53,779
I thought maybe you'd
start chaining them down.

00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:55,548
Although yanking out
vital organs is

00:21:55,548 --> 00:21:57,116
a good way to
keep the clients.

00:21:57,984 --> 00:21:59,051
Henry.

00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:02,213
Right. Um, found
trace of Tetrodotoxin--

00:22:02,213 --> 00:22:03,856
TTX-- in his system.

00:22:03,856 --> 00:22:05,625
It's a naturally
occurring poison,

00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:08,894
1,200 times more
toxic than cyanide.

00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:11,864
It's present in a variety
of sea creatures.

00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:13,966
<i>The toxin blocks</i>
<i>sodium channels,</i>

00:22:13,966 --> 00:22:16,102
<i>blacking out the body's</i>
<i>nervous system.</i>

00:22:16,102 --> 00:22:18,070
<i>A dose the size</i>
<i>of a pinhead can kill,</i>

00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,673
<i>and short of killing, it can</i>
<i>completely paralyze a person</i>

00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:22,842
<i>for hours.</i>

00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:25,878
Considering his condition
in that alley, I checked out

00:22:25,878 --> 00:22:28,714
the half-life table for TTX,
and the current level of toxin

00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:30,683
in him would be consistent
with a dose

00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:32,652
of two milligrams
16 hours ago.

00:22:32,652 --> 00:22:35,521
Enough to paralyze, suppress
heartbeat and breathing,

00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:37,990
and get him mistaken for dead.

00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:40,793
There was a fish tank with
some poisonous specimens

00:22:40,793 --> 00:22:42,128
in the same room
we found him in.

00:22:42,128 --> 00:22:44,210
Could the toxins have been
extracted from them?
Sure.

00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:46,866
With some sophisticated
biochem resources.

00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:48,834
Although there were two
other substances present

00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:52,972
in his system--
LSD and cannabis.

00:22:52,972 --> 00:22:56,642
Body was frozen,
mind was ablaze.

00:22:56,642 --> 00:22:58,210
I've been there.

00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,206
PHILLIPS:
<i>This one's actually dead.</i>

00:23:00,206 --> 00:23:02,548
Congratulations.
You're batting .500.

00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:05,210
Yeah, great for a hitter,
bad for pronouncing death.

00:23:06,212 --> 00:23:08,721
Let me see your EKG.

00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:13,209
What are you looking for, Doc?

00:23:13,209 --> 00:23:16,595
Your zombie from the Strip
was under the influence

00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:18,206
of a paralytic,

00:23:18,206 --> 00:23:20,212
which we would have known if
you'd had the gain on this unit

00:23:20,212 --> 00:23:21,534
correctly calibrated,

00:23:21,534 --> 00:23:23,169
which it's not.

00:23:23,169 --> 00:23:25,705
The way you've got it set, it
wouldn't pick up my heartbeat.

00:23:25,705 --> 00:23:27,212
I'd be a flat-liner.

00:23:27,212 --> 00:23:29,210
You're lucky
you're not benched.

00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:31,213
Misdiagnose the undead again,

00:23:31,213 --> 00:23:33,211
put my assistant
in harm's way,

00:23:33,211 --> 00:23:35,915
and you'll find yourself
unemployed.

00:23:43,209 --> 00:23:47,893
Footprints in salt water
leading towards the door.

00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:51,211
The vic was wearing sneakers,
size eights.

00:23:51,211 --> 00:23:55,000
Yeah, well, these feet
are at least size 11 or 12.

00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,207
Maybe his pal Max
came back here first.

00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:06,679
I've got some
light blue fibers here.

00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:10,207
Same as the T-shirt Max Ferris
was wearing in the morgue.

00:24:10,207 --> 00:24:11,684
So...

00:24:11,684 --> 00:24:14,210
<i>Max makes a break</i>
<i>from the coroner's office,</i>

00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:19,158
<i>comes here, dumps his clothes,</i>
<i>gets in the tank to decompress.</i>

00:24:19,158 --> 00:24:20,626
SIDLE:
<i>And Kurt Dawson shows up.</i>

00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:23,763
<i>They get into some sort</i>
<i>of drug-induced fight.</i>

00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:27,099
(muffled groaning)

00:24:28,768 --> 00:24:32,938
STOKES:
<i>Max wins and walks out of here.</i>

00:24:43,205 --> 00:24:44,517
Hey, Sara.

00:24:44,517 --> 00:24:45,684
Hmm?

00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:48,954
Looks like Kurt lost his camera
in the fight.

00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:53,559
LSD and Tetrodotoxin--
"voodoo powder"--

00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:55,209
curious combination.

00:24:55,209 --> 00:24:57,763
To paralyze yourself

00:24:57,763 --> 00:24:59,207
in order to free yourself...

00:24:59,207 --> 00:25:01,100
Well, what kind
of state of mind

00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:04,069
would that produce in an
individual-- this cocktail?

00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:07,039
There's an entire spectrum
of possibilities.

00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,507
Blazing,

00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:11,214
manic lucidity,
to oppressive darkness.

00:25:11,214 --> 00:25:13,205
Designer drugs--

00:25:13,205 --> 00:25:16,515
one size does not fit all.

00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:19,209
Could this cocktail produce,
in certain individuals,

00:25:19,209 --> 00:25:21,206
uncontrollable rage, say?

00:25:21,206 --> 00:25:23,656
Why do you ask?

00:25:23,656 --> 00:25:25,991
Well, one of our young
explorers killed the other.

00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:30,205
Well, I would have to know
more about the particulars

00:25:30,205 --> 00:25:31,831
of the situation.

00:25:31,831 --> 00:25:35,210
There's no fighting in
the war room, Dr. Strangelove.

00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:38,771
I want you to
look at something.

00:25:38,771 --> 00:25:40,211
FERRIS: ...beyond our past
journeys of the mind.

00:25:40,211 --> 00:25:43,676
Tonight, we free ourselves
from the physical plane.

00:25:43,676 --> 00:25:46,679
Unspooling the mortal coil,

00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:48,614
we seek the mystery
that lies beyond.

00:25:48,614 --> 00:25:51,205
Hey, Discovery Channel,
kill the speech

00:25:51,205 --> 00:25:52,985
and let's kill some brain cells.

00:25:52,985 --> 00:25:55,212
Dude, are you going to tell us
what we're taking?

00:25:55,212 --> 00:25:58,023
No need to add baggage
to your trip.

00:25:58,023 --> 00:25:59,758
Flag on the play.

00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:02,695
This young Columbus
didn't prepare his crew.

00:26:02,695 --> 00:26:05,209
He knew what the toxins
would induce.

00:26:05,209 --> 00:26:08,167
There's a vast difference
between leading others

00:26:08,167 --> 00:26:12,211
into the beyond, and throwing
them into it unwittingly.

00:26:12,211 --> 00:26:13,639
To some,

00:26:13,639 --> 00:26:15,608
that's sinister science,

00:26:15,608 --> 00:26:17,943
and could inspire
rage and fury.

00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:20,211
So, Kurt, not knowing
what he was taking,

00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:23,649
survives the
paralyzing nightmare.

00:26:23,649 --> 00:26:26,212
Comes back to confront Max.

00:26:26,212 --> 00:26:29,955
They fight.
Max kills Kurt.

00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:35,213
Yes. The reckless master
kills the wronged squire.

00:26:35,213 --> 00:26:37,863
Sounds like a role you're
not unfamiliar with.

00:26:37,863 --> 00:26:41,208
Max was modeling himself
after you, Dr. Aden.

00:26:41,208 --> 00:26:42,701
You and your work.

00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:45,537
And here, you see,
he sent his friends

00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:48,841
Alice and Kurt, unwittingly
as you said, into the fire.

00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:54,206
Probably felt like it was
a... a worthy sacrifice.

00:26:54,206 --> 00:26:57,750
Knowledge demands its payment.

00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,210
It's always nice when somebody

00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:01,209
picks up the bill
for you, though.

00:27:04,657 --> 00:27:07,210
Went through Kurt Dawson's
e-mail accounts.

00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:09,212
Found a number of messages
exchanged between him,

00:27:09,212 --> 00:27:13,532
Max Ferris and another WLVU
student, Alice Katsu.

00:27:13,532 --> 00:27:14,800
Alice from the video.

00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,212
Yeah. Biochem major.

00:27:16,212 --> 00:27:19,210
And like Kurt, she seemed
to be under Max's spell.

00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:22,007
Agreeing to his every
experimental whim,

00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:24,109
late night meetings
in the abandoned lab,

00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:26,512
rambling discussions
on the afterlife.

00:27:26,512 --> 00:27:28,113
Well, we know what happened
to Max's other friend.

00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:29,209
We need to find Alice.

00:27:29,209 --> 00:27:31,214
Do you have any earthly
contact info on her?

00:27:31,214 --> 00:27:35,207
So, Mr. Katsu, when was the last
time you saw your sister?

00:27:35,207 --> 00:27:36,213
Three days ago.

00:27:36,213 --> 00:27:37,790
It's just Alice
and me here.

00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:39,558
When she's at school
and I'm at work

00:27:39,558 --> 00:27:41,093
sometimes we go
a couple of days

00:27:41,093 --> 00:27:42,209
without even bumping
into each other.

00:27:42,209 --> 00:27:44,830
Even when she's
here, she's quiet.

00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,099
Sometimes, it feels like having
a ghost in the house.

00:27:55,641 --> 00:27:57,943
Mom liked jelly beans.

00:27:57,943 --> 00:28:00,579
It's a Shinto shrine--
offering for the dead.

00:28:00,579 --> 00:28:03,208
Alice even plucked
out the black ones.

00:28:09,205 --> 00:28:11,214
WILLOWS:
She's got some

00:28:11,214 --> 00:28:13,058
academic honors awards

00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:16,061
from the past few semesters,

00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:18,214
but an academic probation letter
from just a month ago.

00:28:18,214 --> 00:28:21,211
SIDLE:
A card from her mom's funeral

00:28:21,211 --> 00:28:22,568
five months ago.

00:28:22,568 --> 00:28:23,902
Doesn't take a detective.

00:28:23,902 --> 00:28:25,904
Mom's death took a toll.

00:28:28,214 --> 00:28:30,206
Ooh, another one of Dr. Aden's
notebooks.

00:28:37,211 --> 00:28:42,054
"Question of crossing over
physically versus mentally.

00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:43,989
Are they inextricably linked?"

00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:50,211
She took a picture
of Mom's grave every day.

00:28:50,211 --> 00:28:52,931
Capturing the change in light
and seasons.

00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:55,134
Trying to shape something
living out of the dead.

00:28:56,211 --> 00:28:59,638
I think, while Max Ferris
dosed himself

00:28:59,638 --> 00:29:01,840
to explore the mysteries
of the afterlife,

00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,143
and Kurt was out
for a good time, Alice...

00:29:04,143 --> 00:29:06,779
Was traveling in search
of someone.

00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:08,207
Maybe we'll find Alice

00:29:08,207 --> 00:29:10,212
if we look in the same direction
she was looking.

00:29:17,656 --> 00:29:20,893
Groundskeeper said it was
right around here somewhere.

00:29:24,063 --> 00:29:26,732
I don't think they're
going anywhere, Mitch.

00:29:26,732 --> 00:29:28,567
Yeah, right.

00:29:31,904 --> 00:29:34,006
Hey.

00:29:35,741 --> 00:29:38,208
Alice?

00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:46,885
Max?

00:29:50,589 --> 00:29:51,924
Max.

00:29:55,094 --> 00:29:57,212
Whoa!

00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:59,131
Down. On your knees.

00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:04,636
I thought she'd be here.

00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:05,971
Max, you're crashing
from a bad trip.

00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:07,213
We need to get you
to a hospital.

00:30:08,211 --> 00:30:10,042
Stop, Max!

00:30:10,042 --> 00:30:11,210
Stop!

00:30:16,582 --> 00:30:19,214
Stop! Max!

00:30:22,205 --> 00:30:23,205
(tires screech)

00:30:26,725 --> 00:30:28,212
DRIVER:
Oh, my God!

00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:35,000
MITCHELL:
No pulse.

00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,669
I'm cuffing him anyway.
WILLOWS:
Stand back, sir.

00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:40,213
Dr. Aden said this was going
to end badly.

00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:42,074
We have two dead.

00:30:42,074 --> 00:30:44,676
Let's hope there's still
time for Alice.

The notebook I found
in Alice Katsu's room

00:32:01,209 --> 00:32:03,211
is a match to Dr. Aden's
handwriting,

00:32:03,211 --> 00:32:05,757
but the ink looked fresh,
so I tested it.

00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:10,207
It is a date-tag match
to a formula that's only
been around a couple of years.

00:32:10,207 --> 00:32:13,098
Which means Dr. Aden wrote
those notes recently.

00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:16,213
Right. The notebook was not
among his archived papers.

00:32:16,213 --> 00:32:18,103
So how did Alice get it?

00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:19,972
From the doctor himself.

00:32:19,972 --> 00:32:22,209
He and Alice
were e-mail buddies.

00:32:22,209 --> 00:32:23,942
She initiated contact
five months ago.

00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:26,210
When her mother died.
Hmm.

00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:28,747
But Aden is not exactly
advertising on bus benches.

00:32:28,747 --> 00:32:31,783
Alice saw an anonymous
commenter on a Web site
about the doctor's past work.

00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,585
She kind of felt like

00:32:33,585 --> 00:32:35,214
Mr. Anonymous knew
a little bit too much.

00:32:35,214 --> 00:32:38,056
So she e-mails, "Dear sir,

00:32:38,056 --> 00:32:40,214
"I'm convinced by your
brilliant insights

00:32:40,214 --> 00:32:41,960
"that you are
Dr. Aden himself.

00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,763
"I'm a great admirer of your
courageous research

00:32:44,763 --> 00:32:46,211
"into the afterlife.

00:32:46,211 --> 00:32:48,567
I want to follow
in your footsteps."

00:32:48,567 --> 00:32:50,209
He was quick to respond,

00:32:50,209 --> 00:32:51,837
"Glad to have an acolyte,"

00:32:51,837 --> 00:32:53,739
and encouraged her
to find more of them.

00:32:53,739 --> 00:32:56,206
Max and Kurt.

00:32:56,206 --> 00:32:57,876
And we thought Max

00:32:57,876 --> 00:32:59,544
was driving the bus,
but it was Alice.

00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:01,079

JOHNSON:
Hey, you guys.

00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:04,209
I got something for you to see.

00:33:04,209 --> 00:33:06,985
I was scanning through
through Kurt Dawson's video

00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:10,522
and I noticed something strange.

00:33:11,957 --> 00:33:15,214
So, here, Kurt's just
wandering campus.

00:33:15,214 --> 00:33:17,696
Then this happens.

00:33:19,209 --> 00:33:21,208
Some kind of interference.

00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:23,869
Yeah, Kurt's receiver picked up
a signal from another camera.

00:33:23,869 --> 00:33:26,038
I'm working on isolating
the competing image,

00:33:26,038 --> 00:33:27,806
but in the meantime,

00:33:27,806 --> 00:33:29,211
I managed to pull
a few frames.

00:33:29,211 --> 00:33:30,942
WILLOWS:
Well, those are women's shoes.

00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:32,511
Are we looking through
Alice's camera?

00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:35,047
She must have been in close
proximity to Kurt,

00:33:35,047 --> 00:33:37,210
if his receiver picked up
her feet.

00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:38,850
Where is she,
and what's she doing?

00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,753
It's hard to say.
But check this out.

00:33:43,622 --> 00:33:45,957
What, a car stopped for her?

00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:47,213
STOKES:
It looks like an old Saab.

00:33:47,213 --> 00:33:48,727
Hey, didn't Sara mention
something

00:33:48,727 --> 00:33:49,795
about Dr. Aden driving

00:33:49,795 --> 00:33:52,164
an old dinosaur
like that?

00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:09,681
His car's gone.

00:34:09,681 --> 00:34:11,983
Well, he's smart enough
to lead us along,

00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:13,214
maybe he knew
we were coming.

00:34:22,127 --> 00:34:23,161
Dr. Aden!

00:34:33,138 --> 00:34:34,906
Dr. Aden?!

00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,213
Hello?!

00:34:42,881 --> 00:34:44,211
Hello?!

00:34:49,206 --> 00:34:53,208
"Alice-- DMT-- Feb 10, 2011.

Alice-- Ketamine--

00:34:57,796 --> 00:34:59,210
They had a regular thing going.

00:35:03,212 --> 00:35:05,206
This one's from yesterday.

00:35:07,906 --> 00:35:10,142
ADEN:
Can you blink, Alice?

00:35:10,142 --> 00:35:12,611
Come back.

00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:15,580
Come back! Focus!

00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,149
Tell me everything you've seen.

00:35:17,149 --> 00:35:19,985
I need to know
what you're seeing.

00:35:19,985 --> 00:35:21,153
Let me in, Alice.

00:35:21,153 --> 00:35:22,213
Let me in.

00:35:22,213 --> 00:35:24,956
I'm not just your
hookah-smoking caterpillar.

00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:28,093

50 milligrams Tetrodotoxin,
just a mouse click away.

Dr. Aden supplied the paralytic.

00:35:35,212 --> 00:35:37,636
Alice just passed it around.

00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:38,937
Mm-hmm.

00:35:38,937 --> 00:35:40,206

Alice.

00:35:40,206 --> 00:35:41,740
Don't leave me behind!

00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:44,209
Alice?!

00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:47,712
The video camera.

00:35:55,208 --> 00:35:56,855
This one's from today.

00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:07,210
I've come to a crossroads.

00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,770
The false path ends here.

00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:14,539
I've flirted with the precipice
for too long...

00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:17,207
dispatching canaries into
the celestial coal mine,

00:36:17,207 --> 00:36:20,210
but shying from the descent
myself.

00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:22,214
No longer.

00:36:22,214 --> 00:36:29,120
I now slip not just the bonds
of mind, but of body and spirit.

00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,723
I'm ready to set sail...

00:36:31,723 --> 00:36:33,525
unafraid.

A faint pupil response.

He ingested the toxin
around noon.

00:37:20,213 --> 00:37:22,208
At his age,
depriving his brain

00:37:22,208 --> 00:37:25,610
of oxygen for that period
of time, he's in there,

00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:28,914

his way back out.

repaid to them
