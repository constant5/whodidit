00:00:06,917 --> 00:00:08,986
SANDERS:
Strangled.

00:00:08,986 --> 00:00:10,287
Left outside the dumpster.

00:00:10,287 --> 00:00:11,554
That's a new one.

00:00:11,554 --> 00:00:14,091
Maybe the killer
wanted her to be found.

00:00:14,091 --> 00:00:16,427
Wait-- you actually
think this is real?

00:00:16,427 --> 00:00:18,095
Look at her coloring.

00:00:18,095 --> 00:00:19,497
She is not dead.

00:00:19,497 --> 00:00:23,034
With all due respect, Mandy,
you're a fingerprint expert,

00:00:23,034 --> 00:00:25,551
and this is kind of
out of your league.

00:00:25,551 --> 00:00:28,554
And I quote,
"She is not only merely dead,

00:00:28,554 --> 00:00:31,552
she is most sincerely dead."

00:00:31,552 --> 00:00:33,044
I beg to differ, Dorothy.

00:00:33,044 --> 00:00:34,945
SANDERS: If you knew your
<i>Wizard of Oz,you'd know</i>

00:00:34,945 --> 00:00:37,348
that it was the Munchkin coroner
that pronounced her dead,

00:00:37,348 --> 00:00:38,983
not the girl
with the dog.
(Stokes laughs)

00:00:38,983 --> 00:00:41,252
Slow night in here, kids?

00:00:41,252 --> 00:00:43,020
You do know that everything

00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,022
posted on this
Web site's fake,

00:00:45,022 --> 00:00:46,552
don't you?
I mean, come on.

00:00:46,552 --> 00:00:48,025
You guys are supposed
to be professionals.

00:00:48,025 --> 00:00:49,554
Exactly what I've been
trying to tell them.

00:00:49,554 --> 00:00:52,553
So, you made up
your mind already?

00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:54,551
You haven't
thoroughly examined

00:00:54,551 --> 00:00:56,367
the photo.

00:00:56,367 --> 00:00:57,554
That's not very professional.

00:00:57,554 --> 00:00:58,554
(chuckles)

00:00:58,554 --> 00:01:00,552
All right, zoom in on the hand.

00:01:05,076 --> 00:01:07,111
STOKES:
Look there, by her knuckle.

00:01:07,111 --> 00:01:08,555
Blood vessels are distended;

00:01:08,555 --> 00:01:10,047
that means
she has blood pressure.

00:01:10,047 --> 00:01:11,550
Arms flexed,
muscles are contracted.

00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,150
She's alive.

00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:14,919
It's a fake. Case closed.

00:01:14,919 --> 00:01:16,887
Hand is below
the level of her heart.

00:01:16,887 --> 00:01:20,424
Blood's pooled in her extremity,
distending the vessels.

00:01:20,424 --> 00:01:22,558
It could be lividity,
not blood pressure.

00:01:22,558 --> 00:01:24,395
But how do you explain
that flexed arm?

00:01:24,395 --> 00:01:26,997
Body position puts
pressure on the tendons,

00:01:26,997 --> 00:01:31,869
pulling her arm
into a slight flex.

00:01:31,869 --> 00:01:32,970
I say she's dead.

00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,272
Hard to tell
without a body.

00:01:35,272 --> 00:01:36,549
You're right.

00:01:36,549 --> 00:01:40,553
And if this is real,
then we have a DB off the strip.

00:01:40,553 --> 00:01:43,514
Looks like it's, uh,
west of the Tropicana.

00:01:43,514 --> 00:01:44,556
We should go check it out.

00:01:44,556 --> 00:01:47,551
I'm telling you,
it's a waste of time.

00:01:47,551 --> 00:01:49,557
Hundred bucks says I'm right.

00:01:49,557 --> 00:01:51,554
I don't even think
you have $100.

00:01:51,554 --> 00:01:53,057
But let's go; I'll drive.

00:01:58,996 --> 00:02:01,999
(warning siren buzzing)

00:02:07,905 --> 00:02:10,441
STOKES: LVPD-- make a
hole, people.

00:02:10,441 --> 00:02:13,077
Oh, man,
this just keeps getting better.

00:02:13,077 --> 00:02:15,312
(bystanders murmuring)

00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:30,261
"She is most sincerely dead."

00:02:30,261 --> 00:02:31,495
I suppose it would be tasteless

00:02:31,495 --> 00:02:33,550
for me to mention
the 100 bucks you owe me.

00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,932
Extremely.

00:02:34,932 --> 00:02:38,068
Any of you curious kittens
think to call 911?

00:02:38,068 --> 00:02:40,104
Huh?

00:02:40,104 --> 00:02:42,006
Dispatch, Charlie

00:02:42,006 --> 00:02:43,553
0-5 Stokes.
I got a 419.

00:02:43,553 --> 00:02:46,177
I need two backup units
to my location.

00:02:46,177 --> 00:02:47,344
Hey, man! Hey, hey!

00:02:47,344 --> 00:02:48,557
Hey. Hey!

00:02:48,557 --> 00:02:50,915
Hey, that's my camera.
WOMAN: Come on, dude.

00:02:50,915 --> 00:02:52,149
Yeah, well,
now it's our evidence.

00:02:52,149 --> 00:02:53,554
And this is our crime scene.

00:02:53,554 --> 00:02:55,556
And you're a suspect.
I want to see some I.D.

00:02:55,556 --> 00:02:57,321
And that goes for
the rest of you!

00:02:57,321 --> 00:02:58,322
Nobody's leaving now!

00:02:58,322 --> 00:02:59,423
You're all suspects!

00:02:59,423 --> 00:03:00,858
I want to see some I.D.!

00:03:06,163 --> 00:03:07,558
Come on, now.

00:03:09,558 --> 00:03:12,369
Where you going, bud?

00:03:12,369 --> 00:03:14,542

MAN:
Look, Officer,

00:03:53,557 --> 00:03:55,555
I just got off work
at the diner.

00:03:55,555 --> 00:03:57,214
You can call my boss.

00:03:57,214 --> 00:03:59,383
He'll tell you
I was there all night.

00:03:59,383 --> 00:04:01,418
I came by 'cause I saw
the picture on the Web site.

00:04:01,418 --> 00:04:03,220
Nice little crime scene
you got here.

00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,556
So you called in

00:04:04,556 --> 00:04:07,358
your own 419
off a Web posting?

00:04:07,358 --> 00:04:08,492
I mean, I heard
of firemen

00:04:08,492 --> 00:04:09,960
setting fires
to get overtime.

00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,029
Don't tell me you're dropping
bodies for extra cash.

00:04:12,029 --> 00:04:14,031
Well, he does need 100 bucks.

00:04:15,399 --> 00:04:17,368
T.O.D. was
four to six hours ago.

00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:21,472
Petechial hemorrhaging,

00:04:21,472 --> 00:04:23,040
consistent with strangulation.

00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,441
Yeah, the orange cord
around her neck

00:04:24,441 --> 00:04:25,442
was my first clue.

00:04:25,442 --> 00:04:26,410
Yeah.
Looks like a lanyard.

00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:27,878
Something was
attached to it--

00:04:27,878 --> 00:04:31,549
an I.D. badge
or... security pass.

00:04:31,549 --> 00:04:32,950
Could be a robbery.

00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:35,549
Little black dress,
stilettos--

00:04:35,549 --> 00:04:36,553
she could be a tourist.

00:04:36,553 --> 00:04:37,922
BRASS:
Or working girl.

00:04:37,922 --> 00:04:39,423
Either way, she should have
stuck to the Strip.

00:04:39,423 --> 00:04:43,193
I mean, you know, out here--
isolated lot, at night--

00:04:43,193 --> 00:04:45,462
this place is bad news.

00:04:45,462 --> 00:04:46,964
Victim is Amber Rowe.

00:04:46,964 --> 00:04:49,366
Priors for solicitation
and possession.

00:04:49,366 --> 00:04:52,870
Well, C.O.D.'s asphyxiation
due to strangulation.

00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,104
I did a wet mount.

00:04:54,104 --> 00:04:56,552
She had intercourse
shortly before death.

00:04:56,552 --> 00:04:58,442
Lots of swimmers.

00:04:58,442 --> 00:05:00,945
And I thought hookers
enforced the raincoat rule.

00:05:00,945 --> 00:05:03,213
Anyway, she died
around 1:00 a.m.

00:05:03,213 --> 00:05:05,282
Most hookers
hit the streets

00:05:05,282 --> 00:05:06,984
between 11:00
and midnight.

00:05:06,984 --> 00:05:08,319
Maybe those swimmers were from

00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:10,187
her first and last
trick of the night.

00:05:10,187 --> 00:05:12,856
Well, I sent
the rape kit to DNA.

00:05:12,856 --> 00:05:15,960
You mind if I use
your laptop for a second?

00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,027
Open a new window.

00:05:17,027 --> 00:05:18,554
I'm in the middle
of an auction--

00:05:18,554 --> 00:05:21,165
Robert Johnson 78s.

00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:24,034
What's up, Nicky?

00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,973
STOKES: This is a photo
from the Web site.

00:05:28,973 --> 00:05:30,374
Take a look at the position

00:05:30,374 --> 00:05:32,109
of the lanyard.

00:05:32,109 --> 00:05:35,112
It's tight around the bottom
of her neck-- here.

00:05:35,112 --> 00:05:39,216
But the ligature mark
on the body's different.

00:05:39,216 --> 00:05:42,419
It's higher, at an angle.

00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:44,088
This is not a match.

00:05:44,088 --> 00:05:45,555
ROBBINS: The killer
dumped the body, Nick.

00:05:45,555 --> 00:05:48,552
The lanyard could've
changed position.

00:05:48,552 --> 00:05:51,552
Could be any number
of explanations.

00:05:51,552 --> 00:05:52,558
WILLOWS:
I don't know.

00:05:52,558 --> 00:05:54,431
The dress in the photo
looks different, too.

00:05:54,431 --> 00:05:55,966
ROBBINS:
Excuse me?

00:05:55,966 --> 00:05:57,556
They're not the same.

00:05:59,269 --> 00:06:02,558
There's sequins along
the neckline of the dress.

00:06:02,558 --> 00:06:05,242
Take a look at the
dress she was found in.

00:06:05,242 --> 00:06:07,555
Yeah, right here.

00:06:10,558 --> 00:06:12,416
No sequins.

00:06:13,884 --> 00:06:16,551
STOKES:
Same location...

00:06:16,551 --> 00:06:18,551
and I know this is
the same girl.

00:06:18,551 --> 00:06:22,493
The photo shows a different
dress, different ligature.

00:06:22,493 --> 00:06:24,549
Well, how's that happen?

00:06:24,549 --> 00:06:28,032
JOHNSON:
So I contacted the Web hosts

00:06:28,032 --> 00:06:29,550
from VictimsOfVegas.com.

00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:32,102
They sent over the metadata
for the uploaded photo.

00:06:32,102 --> 00:06:34,872
According to the data,
the picture of your dead hooker

00:06:34,872 --> 00:06:36,555
was taken at 12:23 a.m.

00:06:36,555 --> 00:06:38,551
two nights ago.

00:06:38,551 --> 00:06:41,278
But she died around
1:00 a.m.-- this morning.

00:06:41,278 --> 00:06:42,312
So the photo was taken

00:06:42,312 --> 00:06:44,381
at least 24 hours
before she died.

00:06:44,381 --> 00:06:46,216
Your metadata must be wrong.

00:06:46,216 --> 00:06:48,185
No, no, I don't think so.

00:06:48,185 --> 00:06:50,454
You really can't stand
to lose a bet, can you?

00:06:50,454 --> 00:06:51,551
Are you in on this?

00:06:51,551 --> 00:06:52,990
Wait. Don't look at me.

00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:54,191
Data's data.

00:06:54,191 --> 00:06:56,557
Zoom in on that
hubcap, Archie.

00:07:02,132 --> 00:07:03,400
Fireworks?!

00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,436
Yep. Over the Tangiers.

00:07:05,436 --> 00:07:07,071
Every Wednesday night
from midnight to 12:30.

00:07:07,071 --> 00:07:08,472
This photo was taken

00:07:08,472 --> 00:07:10,556
two nights ago, Greg,
and she was alive.

00:07:10,556 --> 00:07:12,549
I think you owe
the man 100 bucks.

00:07:12,549 --> 00:07:13,553
So what are
we saying?

00:07:13,553 --> 00:07:15,512
A killer
fakes a photo

00:07:15,512 --> 00:07:17,047
of a dead hooker
in a dumpster

00:07:17,047 --> 00:07:19,183
24 hours before he
kills her for real?

00:07:19,183 --> 00:07:22,019
That's insane.

00:07:22,019 --> 00:07:24,554
No, you know
what's really insane?

00:07:25,956 --> 00:07:26,957
Betting against me.

00:07:26,957 --> 00:07:29,259
Let's go, baby.

00:07:30,928 --> 00:07:32,553
Thanks a lot, Archie.

00:07:32,553 --> 00:07:33,554
(Johnson laughs)

00:07:44,408 --> 00:07:46,009
Didn't hear
you ride up.

00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:47,551
Thought you said it
was just running rough.

00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:49,313
Yeah, it was until
about a half mile ago

00:07:49,313 --> 00:07:50,981
when it died in front
of a high school...

00:07:50,981 --> 00:07:53,117
full of youngsters
who need to be taught

00:07:53,117 --> 00:07:55,553
that this is
proper motorcycle attire

00:07:55,553 --> 00:07:57,121
and not fodder
for ridicule.

00:07:57,121 --> 00:07:59,223
I thought you said
this bike was all original.

00:07:59,223 --> 00:08:01,554
That's what the guy
at the swap meet told me.

00:08:01,554 --> 00:08:04,128
You bought a vintage bike
at a swap meet?

00:08:04,128 --> 00:08:05,496
Is that bad?

00:08:05,496 --> 00:08:07,554
Tell me you got
the name and number of the guy

00:08:07,554 --> 00:08:08,999
that sold this bike to you.

00:08:08,999 --> 00:08:12,035
Well, he-he had honest eyes
and a firm handshake.

00:08:12,035 --> 00:08:13,904
Your headlight,
your tank-- that's real.

00:08:13,904 --> 00:08:15,072
Your taillight's retro,

00:08:15,072 --> 00:08:18,554
your seat's retro...

00:08:18,554 --> 00:08:19,977
You got some...

00:08:19,977 --> 00:08:22,312
sloppy welding here
at the exhaust.

00:08:22,312 --> 00:08:25,916
This, uh, rearview mirror
is certainly not original.

00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:27,552
(sighs)
So I got suckered.

00:08:27,552 --> 00:08:28,986
Yes, you did.

00:08:28,986 --> 00:08:30,549
My bike's
a Frankenstein monster.

00:08:30,549 --> 00:08:31,549
Yes, Igor.

00:08:31,549 --> 00:08:32,554
But listen...

00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:36,460
maybe we can get it
running again for you.

00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,553
You been working
on the bike, David?

00:08:38,553 --> 00:08:40,197
No. Why?

00:08:40,197 --> 00:08:41,298
Well...

00:08:42,558 --> 00:08:46,436
...there's blood
on your air filter.

00:08:46,436 --> 00:08:49,551
Think I may have
found your problem.

00:08:50,552 --> 00:08:52,209
Ooh!

00:08:52,209 --> 00:08:53,553
What is that?
That is tissue.

00:08:53,553 --> 00:08:55,012
See the ridge detail?
Yeah.

00:08:55,012 --> 00:08:57,047
And the partial nail?
Judging from the width,

00:08:57,047 --> 00:08:59,082
I'd say this was the tip
of someone's thumb.

00:08:59,082 --> 00:09:00,551
All I wanted to buy
was a sweet ride.

00:09:00,551 --> 00:09:02,352
Well, it looks like you
bought yourself a crime scene.

00:09:02,352 --> 00:09:03,551
Yeah, you're right.

00:09:03,551 --> 00:09:05,555
You know, I've been
defrauded.
And "bethumbed."

00:09:05,555 --> 00:09:08,058
Yeah, I'm going to get
to the bottom of this!

00:09:08,058 --> 00:09:10,093
You wanted to be
in the field more.

00:09:10,093 --> 00:09:12,095
Follow the evidence.

00:09:14,464 --> 00:09:16,555
STOKES:<i>I talked to</i>
<i>this vice cop I know.</i>

00:09:16,555 --> 00:09:18,552
He said that Amber
Rowe was a regular,

00:09:18,552 --> 00:09:20,170
but that she
cleaned her act up.

00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:22,372
She got out of the business
about six months ago.

00:09:22,372 --> 00:09:23,551
Guess not.

00:09:26,376 --> 00:09:27,477
LVPD!

00:09:27,477 --> 00:09:28,549

00:09:31,181 --> 00:09:32,182
Can I help you?

00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,251
Yeah, we're looking for

00:09:34,251 --> 00:09:35,557
Amber Rowe's apartment.
Who are you?

00:09:35,557 --> 00:09:37,120
I'm her boyfriend.

00:09:38,288 --> 00:09:40,023
(sighs)

00:09:40,023 --> 00:09:42,059
She, uh...

00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:45,028
promised me she wasn't
going to do it anymore.

00:09:45,028 --> 00:09:46,897
Do you know if she had a pimp?

00:09:46,897 --> 00:09:48,065
Obviously she was...

00:09:48,065 --> 00:09:51,969
pretty good at hiding
that stuff from me.

00:09:51,969 --> 00:09:53,549
SANDERS:
So, she must have been

00:09:53,549 --> 00:09:54,972
getting calls
from dates,

00:09:54,972 --> 00:09:57,557
all hours of the
day and night.

00:09:57,557 --> 00:09:59,549
How'd she hide that?

00:09:59,549 --> 00:10:02,551
She told me that
she was modeling, you know?

00:10:02,551 --> 00:10:04,314
That things were going
really well for her.

00:10:04,314 --> 00:10:05,882
STOKES: So let me
get this straight.

00:10:05,882 --> 00:10:09,086
Your model girlfriend
doesn't come home last night,

00:10:09,086 --> 00:10:10,954
and you don't start to think
there might be something wrong?

00:10:10,954 --> 00:10:12,556
She called me
last night, all right?--

00:10:12,556 --> 00:10:14,191
just after midnight--

00:10:14,191 --> 00:10:16,556
and told me that she was out
with some of her friends.

00:10:16,556 --> 00:10:18,228
She'd see me in the morning.

00:10:18,228 --> 00:10:19,363
It's Vegas.

00:10:19,363 --> 00:10:21,098
And what's your
first name again?

00:10:21,098 --> 00:10:22,555
Craig.

00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:25,002
Craig.

00:10:25,002 --> 00:10:26,557
And, uh...

00:10:26,557 --> 00:10:30,040
what is it that you do
for a living, Craig?

00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,276
I do a little consulting.

00:10:32,276 --> 00:10:33,555
In your pajamas?

00:10:33,555 --> 00:10:35,312
In the middle of the day?

00:10:35,312 --> 00:10:36,555
Hey, you know, I, uh...

00:10:36,555 --> 00:10:40,050
don't see much, uh,
consulting going on.

00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:42,019
Hey, I don't let
my girlfriend support me,

00:10:42,019 --> 00:10:43,153
if that's what you think.

00:10:45,055 --> 00:10:46,554
All right, look.

00:10:46,554 --> 00:10:49,551
I mean, I think, deep down...

00:10:49,551 --> 00:10:50,553
I knew.

00:10:50,553 --> 00:10:52,552
You know?
But I couldn't stop her.

00:10:52,552 --> 00:10:54,549
For Amber,
hooking was...

00:10:54,549 --> 00:10:57,434
was like a drug, you know?

00:10:57,434 --> 00:11:00,370
Nah, I just, uh, I don't know.

00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:02,939
I don't know, I guess
she stayed with me 'cause...

00:11:02,939 --> 00:11:05,208
I made her feel safe.

00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:07,110
Tell you what, why don't you
put on some clothes

00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:09,555
and have a cup of coffee
with the officer outside

00:11:09,555 --> 00:11:12,555
while we take a look around here
for a little bit?

00:11:12,555 --> 00:11:14,451
I mean, you don't mind, do you?

00:11:14,451 --> 00:11:15,556
You got nothing
to hide.

Yeah, found hairs--

Equus burchelli,

So, what, she was sitting
on a zebra?

00:12:58,549 --> 00:13:00,549
More likely zebra-skin seats.

Well, actually,
they're making a comeback,

00:13:06,129 --> 00:13:08,331
starting about
three hours ago.

00:13:08,331 --> 00:13:10,552
Now, a buddy in Patrol
sent this to me.

It's not
an official police photo,

00:13:14,556 --> 00:13:17,107
That's Carrot Top.

00:13:17,107 --> 00:13:18,557
He went missing the other night.

00:13:18,557 --> 00:13:20,557
Kidnapped for a few hours.

00:13:20,557 --> 00:13:23,046

So what's the deal,

00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,342
The sheriff told my manager
everything was cool.

00:13:52,342 --> 00:13:54,177
I said I wouldn't
press any charges.

00:13:54,177 --> 00:13:55,445
Well, now we know why.

00:13:55,445 --> 00:13:57,180
The other night got
a little wilder than your story

00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:00,551
about how some crazed fans
kidnapped you, got you drunk,

00:14:00,551 --> 00:14:02,118
and hog-tied you
in the back of a limo.

00:14:02,118 --> 00:14:03,220

a celebrity--

00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,121

things are a little nutty.

Sometimes you're
a target, you know?

00:14:06,553 --> 00:14:08,291
There's a lot
of crazy people out here.

00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:10,555

My face

00:14:10,555 --> 00:14:12,863
Dude, I kill in Vegas--
look at that.

00:14:12,863 --> 00:14:15,899
That's what we want
to talk to you about.

00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,903
You seen her before?

00:14:21,204 --> 00:14:22,555
Looks like you knew her.

00:14:22,555 --> 00:14:23,907
I did know her.

00:14:23,907 --> 00:14:25,942
She was alive when
I knew her-- she was hot.

00:14:25,942 --> 00:14:27,558
When I say that, I mean,
like, in a live way.

00:14:27,558 --> 00:14:31,114
She was, she was definitely
alive when I saw her last.

00:14:31,114 --> 00:14:32,555
And how did you
two get together?

00:14:32,555 --> 00:14:33,884
I had a show
the other night

00:14:33,884 --> 00:14:35,418
and, uh, I wanted
to blow off a little steam,

00:14:35,418 --> 00:14:37,387
so I got a limo,
just in case

00:14:37,387 --> 00:14:38,889
things turned out better
than they normally do.

00:14:38,889 --> 00:14:41,291
"Carrot Top's Wild Ride."

00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:42,551
How'd it start?

00:14:42,551 --> 00:14:44,861
It started at a,
uh, strip club.

00:14:44,861 --> 00:14:46,550
I know,
shocker, right?

00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:47,555
It's called Crazy Ponies.

00:14:47,555 --> 00:14:49,366
It was great 'cause some
of my fans were there,

00:14:49,366 --> 00:14:50,555
and so, that's good,
'cause they buy you drinks

00:14:50,555 --> 00:14:51,555
and everything else, so...

00:14:51,555 --> 00:14:52,556

00:14:52,556 --> 00:14:54,551

00:14:54,551 --> 00:14:56,339
She was
the "everything else," yeah.

00:14:56,339 --> 00:14:58,008
<i>I remember her high-beams.</i>

00:14:58,008 --> 00:14:59,509
<i>Very attractive.</i>

00:15:00,555 --> 00:15:03,513
<i>I don't remember them as well.</i>

00:15:03,513 --> 00:15:05,550

<i>After that, it was lights out.</i>

for, for passes,

00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:36,913

so I gave 'em

00:15:36,913 --> 00:15:38,549

00:17:36,551 --> 00:17:38,435
I think the body
was vaporized.

00:17:38,435 --> 00:17:40,103
It's possible, isn't it?
Well, there's

00:17:40,103 --> 00:17:42,555
no mention of a motorcycle
in this accident report.

00:17:42,555 --> 00:17:44,174
Nor in any of
the news reports,

00:17:44,174 --> 00:17:46,276
but that doesn't mean
my bike wasn't there.

00:17:46,276 --> 00:17:47,477
Doesn't it?

00:17:47,477 --> 00:17:49,557
Oh, come on, surely
you've heard this story.

00:17:49,557 --> 00:17:50,558
It's been around
for decades.

00:17:50,558 --> 00:17:52,949
No.

00:17:54,951 --> 00:17:59,189
Family in a VW Beetle are
crushed between two semis.

00:17:59,189 --> 00:18:02,258
Nobody realizes this until
they pry the semis apart

00:18:02,258 --> 00:18:04,549
and there's the VW,
accordioned,

00:18:04,549 --> 00:18:06,196
with the family
entombed inside it.

00:18:06,196 --> 00:18:08,465
That sounds like
an urban myth to me.

00:18:08,465 --> 00:18:09,554
Yeah, more like
a fairy tale

00:18:09,554 --> 00:18:12,368
compared to what must have
happened that dark night

00:18:12,368 --> 00:18:14,558
on that lonely stretch
of two-lane terror.

00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:16,557
It says here it happened
during the day.

00:18:16,557 --> 00:18:19,042
Also says...

00:18:19,042 --> 00:18:22,378
the wreckage was hauled away
by Mars Brothers Salvage.

00:18:22,378 --> 00:18:24,380
You might want
to check that out.

00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:36,059
WILLOWS: If you're looking
for tickets for a show,

00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:37,549
I could call in a favor, but...
SANDERS:
Thanks.

00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:39,549
Actually,
I'm looking for these.

00:18:39,549 --> 00:18:40,558
Found them
in the limo.

00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:44,200
Trace says the chain is
silicon-bronze plated

00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,002
and the emerald
is tourmaline.

00:18:46,002 --> 00:18:47,557
It's costume jewelry.

00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:51,174
Emphasis being on costume.

00:18:51,174 --> 00:18:53,176
Bring up
the Mediterranean.

00:18:53,176 --> 00:18:54,177
I already checked.

00:18:54,177 --> 00:18:55,178
The showroom's dark.

00:18:55,178 --> 00:18:56,552
No, not the showroom,
the casino.

00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,549
And click on the
photo gallery.

00:18:58,549 --> 00:18:59,552
Okay, now pull up

00:18:59,552 --> 00:19:02,252
that photo of the Spartan
in the Agora.

00:19:02,252 --> 00:19:03,453
The what?
The mall.

00:19:06,489 --> 00:19:07,924
I helped Sam pick out
those costumes

00:19:07,924 --> 00:19:09,058
when I was a little girl.

00:19:09,058 --> 00:19:11,194
I loved Kirk Douglas
in<i>Spartacus.</i>

00:19:11,194 --> 00:19:14,555
I loved his skirt, his himation.

00:19:14,555 --> 00:19:16,099
I take it that's Greek?

00:19:16,099 --> 00:19:17,556
It's the cloak.

00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:20,555
That and the skirt were my idea.

00:19:20,555 --> 00:19:22,505
All I'm saying is
that your trace

00:19:22,505 --> 00:19:23,940
is from a Greek.

00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:26,554
Spartacus was in that limo.

00:19:31,047 --> 00:19:33,983
Two nights ago,
I was on a bathroom break.

00:19:33,983 --> 00:19:35,558
Can't be easy
in that getup.

00:19:35,558 --> 00:19:37,253
Well, it's not
so much the skirt

00:19:37,253 --> 00:19:39,222
as it is the armor
and weaponry.

00:19:39,222 --> 00:19:41,324
Right up here.

00:19:41,324 --> 00:19:43,326
Scene of the crime.

00:19:44,494 --> 00:19:46,863
I go to the gym, work out.

00:19:46,863 --> 00:19:48,298
Like to think
I can handle myself,

00:19:48,298 --> 00:19:53,269
but these guys caught me
at a strategic disadvantage.

00:19:53,269 --> 00:19:55,471
"Guys"-- so there
was more than one?

00:19:55,471 --> 00:19:56,906
Well, it would
take at least two.

00:19:56,906 --> 00:20:01,177
I mean, I didn't
actually see 'em.

00:20:01,177 --> 00:20:03,346
Here we are.

00:20:03,346 --> 00:20:05,549
All right, well, tell
me what happened.

00:20:05,549 --> 00:20:08,151
Sat my gear down on the floor
like I always do, took a seat.

00:20:22,198 --> 00:20:24,550
<i>I grabbed onto the door,</i>
<i>but they hit me with it.</i>

00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:31,558
<i>Bastard took my sword,</i>
<i>cloak, shield and helmet.</i>

00:20:31,558 --> 00:20:34,410
I mean, took me half
a week's pay to replace them.

00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:36,549
Why would anyone
want that stuff?

00:20:36,549 --> 00:20:37,553
I mean, what guy's gonna dress

00:20:37,553 --> 00:20:38,558
like a Spartan
if he doesn't have to?

00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:40,553
Well, I can think of about 300.

00:20:40,553 --> 00:20:43,152
Excuse me.

00:20:55,555 --> 00:20:59,558
I think I found your barbarians.

00:21:03,172 --> 00:21:04,550
I don't know what
to tell you, boys.

00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:05,556
We just haul
the wrecks away

00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:07,550
and sell off any good
parts we can salvage.

00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:09,879
Do you recall a head-on
collision between two buses

00:21:09,879 --> 00:21:11,180
on Highway 19 last month?

00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,248
Oh, yeah.

00:21:12,248 --> 00:21:13,917
Hell of a mess.
Whew!

00:21:13,917 --> 00:21:16,052
Pretty nasty
cleanup, too.

00:21:16,052 --> 00:21:17,921
Well, do you still
have the buses here?

00:21:17,921 --> 00:21:19,956
Oh, boy.

00:21:19,956 --> 00:21:22,556
You know, my brother Denny's
in charge of inventory.

00:21:22,556 --> 00:21:24,394
Denny!

00:21:24,394 --> 00:21:26,262
What?

00:21:26,262 --> 00:21:28,298
Hey, where are them two buses
from that demo derby on 19?

00:21:30,133 --> 00:21:31,901
They're over in row nine.

00:21:31,901 --> 00:21:33,136
(chuckles)
Man, he's good.

00:21:33,136 --> 00:21:34,971
He's got one of them
photogenic memories.

00:21:34,971 --> 00:21:36,339
Clearly.

00:21:36,339 --> 00:21:37,552
Mind if I
take a look?

00:21:37,552 --> 00:21:39,509
No-- anything
for the police.

00:21:39,509 --> 00:21:42,551
Hey, just remember me
next time I get a ticket.

00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:43,551
(guffaws)

00:21:43,551 --> 00:21:45,553
Huh?
Will do. Yeah.

00:21:45,553 --> 00:21:48,555
Yeah, I, too, am blessed
with a photogenic memory.

00:21:48,555 --> 00:21:50,553
You're good here.

00:21:50,553 --> 00:21:52,553
I'm gonna get to work.

00:21:52,553 --> 00:21:53,990
All right.
Right down that way.

00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:55,124
This row right here.

00:21:55,124 --> 00:21:57,360
Just holler if
you need a hand, partner.

00:22:26,556 --> 00:22:30,556
♪ ♪

00:22:59,554 --> 00:23:00,890
(horn blaring)

00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:03,960
(horn blaring)

00:23:33,551 --> 00:23:34,555
Oh, no.
How embarrassing!

00:23:34,555 --> 00:23:36,125
You are so busted!

00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:38,554
Cyber-schmooze on
your own time there, Arch.

00:23:38,554 --> 00:23:40,096
Yeah, we're in the middle
of a case here.

00:23:40,096 --> 00:23:41,097
So am I.

00:23:41,097 --> 00:23:42,398
In fact, when you were

00:23:42,398 --> 00:23:44,549
on your bathroom break
with the Spartan,

00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:47,036
I traced the photo
of the living hooker

00:23:47,036 --> 00:23:48,555
back to
a social networking site.

00:23:48,555 --> 00:23:50,907
Oh, yeah?
Did you get us a name?
No.

00:23:50,907 --> 00:23:52,909
But I got three
prepaid cell phone users

00:23:52,909 --> 00:23:56,279
all sharing photos
on the site, anonymously.

00:23:56,279 --> 00:23:59,482
See, there's Carrot Top...
STOKES: And Amber.

00:23:59,482 --> 00:24:02,318
Number three:
"Kidnap a celebrity"?

00:24:02,318 --> 00:24:03,557
Check out number two.

00:24:04,854 --> 00:24:06,558
SANDERS:
"Steal from a casino."

00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:08,552
And number one?

00:24:09,553 --> 00:24:11,127
"Grand theft auto."

00:24:11,127 --> 00:24:13,196
JOHNSON: I mean, all these
photos were posted

00:24:13,196 --> 00:24:14,550
on the same night--

00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:16,557
the night beforeyour hooker
was actually murdered.

00:24:16,557 --> 00:24:20,436
Including this photo,
that ended up on VictimsOfVegas.

00:24:20,436 --> 00:24:23,439
Number four: "Kill a hooker."

00:24:23,439 --> 00:24:25,374
Okay, three cell phones,
three suspects--

00:24:25,374 --> 00:24:28,010
this is like some kind
of twisted bucket list.

00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:30,551
The night starts with stealing
a car, ends in murder.

00:24:30,551 --> 00:24:32,558
Except it didn't--
they only went through with

00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:34,552
the first three things
on the list.

00:24:34,552 --> 00:24:35,558
And they didn't kill the hooker.

00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:37,186
At least not until
the following night.

00:24:37,186 --> 00:24:39,922
All right, so,
maybe on the first night,

00:24:39,922 --> 00:24:41,555
the creeps got cold feet.

00:24:41,555 --> 00:24:43,126
And then, the next night,

00:24:43,126 --> 00:24:46,329
they decided to complete their
list before heading home.

00:24:46,329 --> 00:24:48,553
Let's just hope
the list ends here.

00:24:54,871 --> 00:24:57,006
The part I pulled from
the bus at the junkyard

00:24:57,006 --> 00:24:59,342
was definitely from
a Triumph motorcycle.
Sounds like you found out

00:24:59,342 --> 00:25:01,552
where the parts for your
Frankenstein bike came from.
Mm-hmm.

00:25:01,552 --> 00:25:04,413
Serial number traced
back to a bike owned
by a Peter Farmer.

00:25:04,413 --> 00:25:06,315
Last known address:
214 Harlan Way.

00:25:06,315 --> 00:25:08,551
Yeah, it's an apartment.
I talked to the landlord.

00:25:08,551 --> 00:25:10,557
Farmer's ex-girlfriend
still lives there.
You bringing her in?

00:25:10,557 --> 00:25:12,549
She's on her
way to PD.
Great.

00:25:12,549 --> 00:25:14,550
Care to join me?
Why not?

00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:16,292
I can't believe it.

00:25:16,292 --> 00:25:19,862
Are you sure,
smashed between two busses?

00:25:19,862 --> 00:25:21,497
We're sorry for your loss.

00:25:21,497 --> 00:25:25,868
Uh, when was the last time
you... saw Peter?

00:25:27,036 --> 00:25:28,938
The day he left.

00:25:28,938 --> 00:25:31,440
I felt bad;
I-I made him lunch.

00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,875
Curry egg salad.

00:25:32,875 --> 00:25:34,277
I love that.

00:25:34,277 --> 00:25:36,245
On toast points.

00:25:37,549 --> 00:25:40,216
I remember his last words.

00:25:41,317 --> 00:25:43,452
"We'll always have Comic Con."

00:25:45,254 --> 00:25:46,989
You were very close.

00:25:46,989 --> 00:25:48,224
I loved him.

00:25:48,224 --> 00:25:50,553
But... he couldn't commit.

00:25:50,553 --> 00:25:53,396
He never loved me
the way he loved his mother.

00:25:53,396 --> 00:25:56,098
That's why I ended it.

00:25:56,098 --> 00:25:57,433
It's my fault.

00:25:57,433 --> 00:26:00,403
I'm the reason
he was on that motorcycle.

00:26:00,403 --> 00:26:01,556
Why do you say that?

00:26:01,556 --> 00:26:05,208
After I broke up with Peter,
he was... lost,

00:26:05,208 --> 00:26:06,558
adrift, searching.

00:26:06,558 --> 00:26:08,077
Uh-huh.

00:26:08,077 --> 00:26:10,046
He bought the bike.

00:26:10,046 --> 00:26:11,556
Bought a whole outfit.

00:26:11,556 --> 00:26:14,554
He looked just like
Marlon Brando in<i>The Wild One.</i>

00:26:14,554 --> 00:26:16,285
Except thinner.

00:26:16,285 --> 00:26:17,453
He wanted to...

00:26:17,453 --> 00:26:19,188
hit the open road

00:26:19,188 --> 00:26:21,958
and... find himself.

00:26:21,958 --> 00:26:23,226
I know.

00:26:23,226 --> 00:26:25,861
May I ask you something?

00:26:25,861 --> 00:26:27,556
Okay.

00:26:27,556 --> 00:26:29,899
Was there... anything
he could have said,

00:26:29,899 --> 00:26:31,968
was there... something
he could have done

00:26:31,968 --> 00:26:34,971
that would have convinced you
to give him one more chance?

00:26:34,971 --> 00:26:36,906
GIRLFRIEND:
Um...

00:26:36,906 --> 00:26:39,976
I've asked myself that
same question over and over.

00:26:39,976 --> 00:26:42,078
And?

00:26:42,078 --> 00:26:44,914
There is one thing.

00:26:44,914 --> 00:26:46,551
(phone rings)
What?
Oh.

00:26:46,551 --> 00:26:47,557
It's my boyfriend.

00:26:47,557 --> 00:26:51,550
Uh, he's got a big
race today-- triathlete.

00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:53,456
I, uh, I gotta go.

00:26:53,456 --> 00:26:55,224
Thank you for...

00:26:55,224 --> 00:26:57,555
for telling me about Peter.

00:26:57,555 --> 00:27:00,229
You remind me so much of him.

00:27:00,229 --> 00:27:04,000
Thank you.

00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,236
Uh, can I ask
you something?

00:27:07,236 --> 00:27:08,871
Yes. What is it?

00:27:08,871 --> 00:27:10,549
How far did he get?

00:27:10,549 --> 00:27:14,554
The Grand Canyon?
Glacier Park? Nova Scotia?

00:27:14,554 --> 00:27:16,879
Highway 19, near
the 12 junction.

00:27:16,879 --> 00:27:20,216
A quarter mile.

00:27:20,216 --> 00:27:21,551
Huh.

00:27:29,492 --> 00:27:32,028
SANDERS: Archie got the numbers
from the prepaid cells

00:27:32,028 --> 00:27:33,896
that shared
the bucket list photos

00:27:33,896 --> 00:27:35,464
on the social
networking site.

00:27:35,464 --> 00:27:37,900
WILLOWS:
Mm-hmm.
Area codes are all 312.

00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,135
Chicago.

00:27:39,135 --> 00:27:41,549
Oh. Even a life of
rooting for the Cubs

00:27:41,549 --> 00:27:43,205
is no excuse
for this behavior.

00:27:43,205 --> 00:27:44,907
So we know where
the guys are from,

00:27:44,907 --> 00:27:46,375
we just don't know
who they are.

00:27:46,375 --> 00:27:48,044
I might be able
to help with that.

00:27:48,044 --> 00:27:49,879
The prints
on the men's door

00:27:49,879 --> 00:27:54,016
that clocked that Spartan
came back to a Scott Horan.

00:27:54,016 --> 00:27:55,558
WILLOWS: Arrested ten
years ago for trespassing.

00:27:55,558 --> 00:27:57,386
He tried to mount
Caesar's chariot

00:27:57,386 --> 00:27:59,021
and race it down the Strip.

00:27:59,021 --> 00:28:00,189
What?!

00:28:00,189 --> 00:28:01,556
I love this town.

00:28:01,556 --> 00:28:03,993
Looks like our
chariot-jacker's from Chicago.

00:28:03,993 --> 00:28:06,295
Let's see what
he's doing now.

00:28:08,898 --> 00:28:13,069
Scott Horan--
still living in the Windy City.

00:28:13,069 --> 00:28:14,270
32 years old.

00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:16,372
Guy's got
a Maybach<i>anda Bentley</i>

00:28:16,372 --> 00:28:17,506
registered to him.

00:28:17,506 --> 00:28:18,550
Boy's got dough.

00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:19,875
WILLOWS:
You know how boys

00:28:19,875 --> 00:28:21,110
tire of their toys.

00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:23,079
But if he
considers this playtime,

00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:24,553
we need to end it.

00:28:24,553 --> 00:28:28,484
I'll have Brass trap
Horan's credit cards.

00:28:33,558 --> 00:28:36,158
BRASS: So, hotel security
spotted Scott Horan

00:28:36,158 --> 00:28:37,426
in a long checkout line.

00:28:37,426 --> 00:28:39,028
We pulled his
credit cards receipts.

00:28:39,028 --> 00:28:41,464
We found out that
he bought three plane tickets

00:28:41,464 --> 00:28:42,554
and three rooms.

00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:45,556
The other names are
Hunter Ahern and Jeff Blakely.

00:28:45,556 --> 00:28:47,903
That must be our
other two suspects.
<i>Exactamente.</i>

00:28:50,557 --> 00:28:52,108
Larry, Curly and Moe.

00:28:52,108 --> 00:28:54,556
Las Vegas Police.
You're under arrest.

00:28:54,556 --> 00:28:56,550
We-We didn't
do anything. Ow.

00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:58,314
What the hell'd you do, Scott?
Dude, you dime us out?

00:28:58,314 --> 00:28:59,949
No, hey, look... hey,
this isn't what you think.

00:28:59,949 --> 00:29:00,916
JEFF:
Big misunderstanding. Huge!

00:29:00,916 --> 00:29:03,252
HUNTER:
Seriously, I can explain!

00:29:03,252 --> 00:29:05,921
Look, we didn't
do anything.

00:29:05,921 --> 00:29:07,256
Really, Hunter?

00:29:07,256 --> 00:29:08,958
Who's lying, you
or the pictures?

00:29:08,958 --> 00:29:10,551
We were just playing a game.

00:29:10,551 --> 00:29:12,550
Felony murder's not a game.

00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:15,551
Golf is a game.

00:29:15,551 --> 00:29:17,199
SCOTT:
<i>We came to Vegas to celebrate</i>

00:29:17,199 --> 00:29:19,135
our ten-year college reunion.
STOKES:
Oh, yeah?

00:29:19,135 --> 00:29:20,552
Is killing a hooker
how you celebrate?

00:29:20,552 --> 00:29:23,205
Uh, these pictures are fake.

00:29:23,205 --> 00:29:25,141
My buddies, Jeff and Hunter,
they were messing with me,

00:29:25,141 --> 00:29:28,177
and I fell for it--
at least at first--

00:29:28,177 --> 00:29:30,558
but, uh, no,
these are a joke at my expense.

00:29:30,558 --> 00:29:32,181
A joke?

00:29:32,181 --> 00:29:34,316
That young lady's dead.
This ain't no joke.

00:29:34,316 --> 00:29:37,987
I'm, uh, I'm telling you that
these are not real pictures.

00:29:37,987 --> 00:29:39,554
She's not dead.

00:29:39,554 --> 00:29:41,323
You can ask her.
She'll tell you.

00:29:41,323 --> 00:29:43,555
Well, she already told me
from the autopsy table.

00:29:45,261 --> 00:29:47,163
She's really dead?

00:29:50,032 --> 00:29:51,549
As dead as it gets.

00:29:51,549 --> 00:29:54,203
That's why you're
here, Scott.

00:29:54,203 --> 00:29:56,439
If Jeff and Hunter killed her

00:29:56,439 --> 00:29:58,174
and you know
something,

00:29:58,174 --> 00:30:01,550
well, you better talk to me
or you're going down with them.

00:30:04,113 --> 00:30:06,449
Look, it was my idea
to come to Vegas.

00:30:06,449 --> 00:30:07,554
The last time
we were here,

00:30:07,554 --> 00:30:09,351
we did all these things
on a dare.

00:30:09,351 --> 00:30:10,557
Yeah, yeah, like, uh,
steal Caesar's chariot

00:30:10,557 --> 00:30:12,121
and ride down
the Strip.

00:30:12,121 --> 00:30:14,490
I was a kid.
It was a dumb thing to do.

00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:15,558
I got busted.

00:30:15,558 --> 00:30:18,550
And I still had the dare list
from ten years ago.

00:30:19,929 --> 00:30:23,499
<i>And I thought it would be fun</i>
<i>to do it again.</i>

00:30:23,499 --> 00:30:25,134
(laughing)

00:30:25,134 --> 00:30:26,936
This is so lame, dude.

00:30:26,936 --> 00:30:28,549
I can't believe
we did this.

00:30:28,549 --> 00:30:30,406
Nah, it just needs
a little work.

00:30:31,554 --> 00:30:34,043
<i>Hunter's a magazine editor.</i>

00:30:34,043 --> 00:30:36,278
<i>It's his job to edit</i>
<i>and spice things up.</i>

00:30:36,278 --> 00:30:37,480
<i>That's what he did.</i>

00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,048
A game?!

00:30:39,048 --> 00:30:40,516
Grand theft auto?

00:30:40,516 --> 00:30:41,951
Stealing from a casino?

00:30:41,951 --> 00:30:43,853
Kidnapping? Murder?

00:30:43,853 --> 00:30:46,021
What do you get
when you win this game?

00:30:46,021 --> 00:30:48,190
HUNTER:
<i>Nothing.</i>

00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:49,859
Well, I mean, everything.

00:30:49,859 --> 00:30:52,361
A free weekend in Vegas--
loser pays.

00:30:52,361 --> 00:30:53,362
In this case, Scott.

00:30:53,362 --> 00:30:54,557
He picked up the tab
for all of you.

00:30:54,557 --> 00:30:56,966
(scoffs)
As smart as Scott is,

00:30:56,966 --> 00:31:01,170
it never ceases to amaze me
how easy it is to mess with him.

00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:02,558
I mean, the guy's a loser.

00:31:02,558 --> 00:31:04,554
He's always been a loser.

00:31:04,554 --> 00:31:06,375
But he's our loser.

00:31:06,375 --> 00:31:08,511
Even when we were kids.

00:31:08,511 --> 00:31:09,556
Back then,
his dad was loaded.

00:31:09,556 --> 00:31:10,946
Then Scott struck it rich

00:31:10,946 --> 00:31:12,550
a couple years ago
with this software app.

00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:14,552
So what are you saying-- this
whole thing was just a setup

00:31:14,552 --> 00:31:16,218
for your loser pal
to pay for your weekend?

00:31:16,218 --> 00:31:17,920
And have a little fun
at his expense.

00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,488
It was going great

00:31:19,488 --> 00:31:22,224
until we had a little
rules dispute.

00:31:22,224 --> 00:31:23,425
<i>Scott was pissed.</i>

00:31:23,425 --> 00:31:24,860
<i>Said we cheated</i>
<i>because we teamed up,</i>

00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,428
<i>instead of playing on our own.</i>

00:31:26,428 --> 00:31:29,932
You rolled a greeter in
a men's room, and you call this

00:31:29,932 --> 00:31:31,554
stealing from a casino?
I'm sorry.

00:31:31,554 --> 00:31:33,035
You're an embarrassment.

00:31:33,035 --> 00:31:34,551
It's just sad.

00:31:34,551 --> 00:31:35,556
I was following the rules.

00:31:35,556 --> 00:31:37,551
JEFF: Yeah, and before
that, you tipped a valet

00:31:37,551 --> 00:31:39,909
so you could drive some jerk's
Ferrari around the block.

00:31:39,909 --> 00:31:42,550
We frickin' kidnapped
Carrot Top!

00:31:44,551 --> 00:31:46,115
Give it up, Poindexter.

00:31:46,115 --> 00:31:47,553
Your friends won.

00:31:47,553 --> 00:31:50,419
HUNTER:<i>Scott said he</i>
<i>was through with the game,</i>

00:31:50,419 --> 00:31:53,155
but we told him there was
one more dare left on the list.

00:31:53,155 --> 00:31:54,356
"Kill a hooker."

00:31:54,356 --> 00:31:57,426
No. We just made it look
like we did.

00:31:57,426 --> 00:31:59,895
Ready? Okay.

00:31:59,895 --> 00:32:01,063
(laughing)
Really. Get down.

00:32:01,063 --> 00:32:02,553
Put your arm right over--
aw, that's perfect.

00:32:02,553 --> 00:32:04,558
Okay. (laughs)

00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:06,558
HUNTER:<i>We paid Amber</i>
<i>to lure Carrot Top,</i>

00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:09,939
<i>so we figured, for a few</i>
<i>bucks more, she'd play dead.</i>

00:32:09,939 --> 00:32:11,941
I mean, hell,
she even thought it was funny.

00:32:11,941 --> 00:32:14,556
And then you sent the photo
to your buddy Scott.

00:32:14,556 --> 00:32:15,911
BRASS:
Bet he freaked out.

00:32:15,911 --> 00:32:17,079
Understatement.

00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:18,414
Here's what I don't understand.

00:32:18,414 --> 00:32:20,115
Why'd you go back
the next night and kill Amber?

00:32:20,115 --> 00:32:21,083
You already won.

00:32:21,083 --> 00:32:22,551
We didn't kill her.

00:32:22,551 --> 00:32:24,557
Well, at least... well, at
least, I didn't kill her.

00:32:24,557 --> 00:32:26,455
Well, somebody did.

00:32:26,455 --> 00:32:29,557
And then they posted
your fake photo on some Web site

00:32:29,557 --> 00:32:31,894
for psychologically disturbed
individuals.

00:32:31,894 --> 00:32:33,554
I swear I don't know
anything about that.

00:32:33,554 --> 00:32:36,554
The only thing we did with that
photo was e-mail it to Scott.

00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:38,500
Are you sure
about that?

00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,935
Because you and your buddies
were the only ones

00:32:39,935 --> 00:32:41,203
<i>who had the photo.</i>

00:32:41,203 --> 00:32:42,204
Oh, no.

00:32:42,204 --> 00:32:43,472
Amber.

00:32:43,472 --> 00:32:45,074
Amber?!

00:32:45,074 --> 00:32:46,308
She wanted a copy.

00:32:46,308 --> 00:32:48,143
I e-mailed the photo to her.

00:32:48,143 --> 00:32:50,446
I told Hunter
not to give it to her.

00:32:50,446 --> 00:32:52,181
Chick said she wanted
to show her boyfriend.

00:32:52,181 --> 00:32:54,483
Said it was the easiest
two grand she ever made.

00:32:54,483 --> 00:32:55,985
Her boyfriend?

00:32:55,985 --> 00:32:57,219
Does he have a name?

00:32:57,219 --> 00:32:59,488
I think it was... Greg or Craig.

00:32:59,488 --> 00:33:01,290
Something like that.

00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:03,292
Where did you drop Amber off?

00:33:03,292 --> 00:33:05,027
Where we met her.

00:33:05,027 --> 00:33:06,549
<i>At the hotel bar.</i>

00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:08,464
MAN:<i>Yeah, I know this guy.</i>
<i>He's at the tables</i>

00:33:08,464 --> 00:33:09,554
every single night.

00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:11,554
You know what he is?
He's a cheap bastard.

00:33:11,554 --> 00:33:13,335
Win or lose,
the guy never tips.

00:33:13,335 --> 00:33:15,204
Seen him lately?
Yeah, that's his usual table.

00:33:15,204 --> 00:33:17,557
Let's go. You've been killing me
all night, Ty. Let's go!

00:33:17,557 --> 00:33:20,009
DEALER:
Good luck.
Yeah-- 18.
I'll take it.

00:33:23,379 --> 00:33:24,554
Is this how you mourn
the loss of your girlfriend?

00:33:24,554 --> 00:33:26,081
Not now.
All right, guys? I'm working.

00:33:26,081 --> 00:33:27,249
BRASS:
No, you're all done.

00:33:27,249 --> 00:33:28,484
You're all done, Cool Hand.

00:33:28,484 --> 00:33:29,555
You're coming with me.
Let's go downtown.

00:33:29,555 --> 00:33:30,555
Downtown?
Yeah.

00:33:30,555 --> 00:33:31,887
I don't think so, okay?

00:33:31,887 --> 00:33:33,255
I'm doubling down here.
It's a big hand.

00:33:33,255 --> 00:33:35,157
You're doubling down?
(Craig grunts, woman gasps)

00:33:35,157 --> 00:33:36,225
Color him out.

00:33:37,393 --> 00:33:39,228
My chips!

00:33:39,228 --> 00:33:41,063
I got this.
Don't worry about it.

00:33:41,063 --> 00:33:42,552
This is from Amber.

00:33:42,552 --> 00:33:44,004
Take it all.

00:33:52,441 --> 00:33:53,442
Hey, Denny.

00:33:53,442 --> 00:33:54,877
Is your brother around?

00:33:54,877 --> 00:33:56,145
Hey, Doyle!

00:33:56,145 --> 00:33:58,180
Your buddy's back.

00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:00,416
Hey, Crime Lab Man!

00:34:00,416 --> 00:34:02,552
(whoops)

00:34:02,552 --> 00:34:03,557
Nice bike.

00:34:03,557 --> 00:34:05,054
Oh, you think so?

00:34:05,054 --> 00:34:07,456
Want to ask you about a refund.

00:34:07,456 --> 00:34:09,553
Refund? (laughs)

00:34:09,553 --> 00:34:11,550
I didn't sell it to you.

00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,553
No, but you sold the parts

00:34:13,553 --> 00:34:15,497
to the guy
who made this Frankenstein.

00:34:15,497 --> 00:34:17,866
Which means that you knew
that this motorcycle

00:34:17,866 --> 00:34:21,070
and its dead rider were
involved in that bus wreck,

00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:23,906
and you didn't
report it.

00:34:23,906 --> 00:34:25,549
That's evidence tampering.

00:34:25,549 --> 00:34:27,556
Come on now, hoss.

00:34:27,556 --> 00:34:29,558
I'm just trying
to make a living here, man.

00:34:29,558 --> 00:34:32,081
If I sell a few extra parts
on the side, what's the harm?

00:34:32,081 --> 00:34:33,482
The man's already dead.

00:34:33,482 --> 00:34:36,351
Well, thanks to you,
nobody knew that.

00:34:36,351 --> 00:34:38,854
(chuckles quietly)

00:34:38,854 --> 00:34:40,923
Well...

00:34:40,923 --> 00:34:43,552
I'm sure we can
work something out.

00:34:43,552 --> 00:34:47,296
What kind of refund would
make you look the other way?

00:34:47,296 --> 00:34:49,298
It's not going
to cost you any money.

00:34:49,298 --> 00:34:51,554
No, but it'll cost you
six months in County.

00:34:51,554 --> 00:34:53,001
You're both under arrest

00:34:53,001 --> 00:34:54,554
for obstruction
of justice.

00:34:54,554 --> 00:34:56,205
(snickers)

00:34:56,205 --> 00:34:58,207
I got to know.

00:34:58,207 --> 00:35:00,209
How'd you figure it out?

00:35:00,209 --> 00:35:02,244
I followed the evidence.

00:35:02,244 --> 00:35:05,553
Where you saw some scrap
and some quick cash, I saw a man

00:35:05,553 --> 00:35:07,116
who needed
to be spoken for.

00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:10,558
Your brother's the one
who gave me the tip.

00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:15,558
(grunts)

00:35:15,558 --> 00:35:17,359
(groaning)

00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:19,061
(gasps)

00:35:23,465 --> 00:35:25,549
You got this.

00:35:25,549 --> 00:35:27,069
What about your bike?

00:35:27,069 --> 00:35:28,370
Oh, keep it.

00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:29,557
It's evidence.

00:35:29,557 --> 00:35:31,557
I'm done with the open road.

00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:43,018
You got nothing.

00:35:43,018 --> 00:35:44,556
These are Amber's
bank records.

00:35:44,556 --> 00:35:47,256
You cleaned her out
after she died.
Yeah.

00:35:47,256 --> 00:35:49,892
Well, what's hers is mine, okay?

00:35:49,892 --> 00:35:51,550
That's love, buddy.

00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:53,555
No, sir. This here is motive.

00:35:53,555 --> 00:35:56,331
Now, the staff
at the Luxor tells me

00:35:56,331 --> 00:36:00,235
that you drop a couple of g's
there every other day.

00:36:00,235 --> 00:36:01,303
Is that why you forced
your girlfriend

00:36:01,303 --> 00:36:02,304
to start hooking again?

00:36:02,304 --> 00:36:04,306
Hey, I did not
force her, okay?

00:36:04,306 --> 00:36:05,556
She did it on her own.

00:36:05,556 --> 00:36:07,509
She wanted to
do it, you know?

00:36:07,509 --> 00:36:09,077
Hey, what do they say--

00:36:09,077 --> 00:36:10,552
"once a whore,
always a whore."

00:36:10,552 --> 00:36:12,552
Wow.

00:36:12,552 --> 00:36:14,555
Wow, you know,
you're a real gentleman.

00:36:14,555 --> 00:36:16,084
Thank you.

00:36:16,084 --> 00:36:18,553
I think she wanted to leave you,
but you wouldn't let her.

00:36:18,553 --> 00:36:21,089
She showed you that phony photo
of her own death.

00:36:21,089 --> 00:36:23,926
You just took it as an
opportunity to really kill her.

00:36:23,926 --> 00:36:26,553
You could just pin it on one
of those Chi Town flunkies.

00:36:26,553 --> 00:36:27,963
Am I right?

00:36:27,963 --> 00:36:29,998
No. No.

00:36:29,998 --> 00:36:32,134
Listen to me.
Amber-- she loved me, okay?

00:36:32,134 --> 00:36:34,552
Everything she did,
she did it for me.

00:36:34,552 --> 00:36:36,556
You know, on the night she
died, she called me, okay?

00:36:36,556 --> 00:36:38,173
Earlier in the night.
She said

00:36:38,173 --> 00:36:40,553
she came into some green,
some cash-- five grand and...

00:36:40,553 --> 00:36:42,511
(sighs, groans)

00:36:42,511 --> 00:36:45,280
I had kind of a rough night
at the tables that night, so...

00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,515
What was I gonna do?

00:36:46,515 --> 00:36:48,551
She said she'd put it
in my account.

00:36:48,551 --> 00:36:50,557
Hey, call the Luxor, okay?

00:36:50,557 --> 00:36:53,455
I was there,
all night long-- losing.

00:36:54,556 --> 00:36:56,992
Five grand, huh?

00:36:56,992 --> 00:36:59,228
How many tricks
did she have to turn

00:36:59,228 --> 00:37:00,896
to make that kind of money?

00:37:00,896 --> 00:37:03,398
One.

00:37:03,398 --> 00:37:06,001
Guy's little head was doing
all the thinking for him.

00:37:06,001 --> 00:37:07,549
You know, he even told her

00:37:07,549 --> 00:37:09,471
he would give her
another five g's

00:37:09,471 --> 00:37:10,555
after he was done.

00:37:10,555 --> 00:37:11,907
Idiot.

00:37:11,907 --> 00:37:14,009
And who was this guy?

00:37:14,009 --> 00:37:16,554
He's one of those guys--
Chi Town flunkies.

00:37:16,554 --> 00:37:18,554
Hey...

00:37:18,554 --> 00:37:20,557
how did she get you
that much cash

00:37:20,557 --> 00:37:22,556
in the middle of the night?

00:37:22,556 --> 00:37:24,319
You ever hear of an ATM?

00:37:24,319 --> 00:37:26,088
<i>They scan cash now.</i>

00:37:41,003 --> 00:37:43,972
Bank traced Amber's $5,000

00:37:43,972 --> 00:37:45,554
deposit to this ATM.

00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:47,558
And if one of our Chicago boys
gave her the money,

00:37:47,558 --> 00:37:49,555
his prints may still be on it.

00:37:49,555 --> 00:37:53,115
The last cash deposit
was for $1,200.

00:37:56,318 --> 00:37:58,320
$1,200.

00:38:00,554 --> 00:38:03,550
Cash deposit for $1,500.

00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:07,162
Another cash deposit for $280.

00:38:09,097 --> 00:38:10,866
That's $5,000.

You... You killed

00:39:50,132 --> 00:39:52,555
Man up.

00:39:52,555 --> 00:39:54,551
You got bills to pay.

00:39:54,551 --> 00:39:57,551
By the way,
we drained the minibar.

HORAN:
<i>I thought they really did it.</i>

00:40:03,551 --> 00:40:06,515
I wanted to call the cops a
hundred times, but I was scared.

00:40:06,515 --> 00:40:09,557
The minute I make
that call, my life

00:40:09,557 --> 00:40:11,086
is over.

00:40:11,086 --> 00:40:13,551
Whether I killed her or not,
I'm a part of it.

00:40:13,551 --> 00:40:16,091
<i>Tried to drink it all away.</i>

00:40:16,091 --> 00:40:18,026
<i>Or maybe tried</i>
<i>to get up the courage</i>

00:40:18,026 --> 00:40:20,996
<i>to do the right thing.</i>

00:40:20,996 --> 00:40:22,556
<i>And then she walked in.</i>

00:40:30,205 --> 00:40:32,551
You're friends with the guys.

00:40:32,551 --> 00:40:35,556
Yup. Uh, you know, I, uh...

00:40:35,556 --> 00:40:38,380
I fell for it.

00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:40,248
Come on,
you can't be that stupid.

00:40:40,248 --> 00:40:41,850
(laughs)

00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:44,119
HORAN:<i>She told me</i>
<i>she was in on the whole thing.</i>

00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:45,556
<i>When I told her</i>
<i>that I really thought</i>

00:40:45,556 --> 00:40:48,390
she was dead...

00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:50,292
she just started laughing.

00:40:50,292 --> 00:40:54,496
She said she couldn't believe
that I was so stupid.

00:40:56,498 --> 00:41:00,135
I could take that from the guys,
but not from some whore.

00:41:00,135 --> 00:41:02,553
That's when I
figured it out.

00:41:02,553 --> 00:41:06,208
A way to wipe the smiles off
all their faces.

00:41:06,208 --> 00:41:08,556
<i>I offered her ten grand</i>
<i>for another photo shoot.</i>

00:41:10,557 --> 00:41:12,914
<i>In all those years...</i>

00:41:12,914 --> 00:41:15,552
<i>I know it's sick, but...</i>
<i>it felt so good...</i>

00:41:15,552 --> 00:41:17,953

00:41:17,953 --> 00:41:20,255
<i>...to one-up them.</i>

00:41:20,255 --> 00:41:23,925
After I killed
Amber, I uploaded

00:41:23,925 --> 00:41:27,262
the staged photo-- their photo--
to that Vegas Web site,

00:41:27,262 --> 00:41:31,032
and I killed<i>theirhooker.</i>

00:41:31,032 --> 00:41:33,468
On the plane home,
I was going to tell them

00:41:33,468 --> 00:41:36,550
that I did it, but they were
on the hook for it.

00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:37,557
I won.

00:41:40,208 --> 00:41:42,552
I was finally the one
calling the shots.

00:41:42,552 --> 00:41:44,246
I was The Man.

00:41:44,246 --> 00:41:47,249
And-And what's that like,
being The Man?

00:41:49,117 --> 00:41:52,254
BRASS: So your friends
are gonna go to jail
for misdemeanor.

00:41:52,254 --> 00:41:56,224
You're going
to go to prison for murder one.

00:41:56,224 --> 00:41:58,226
I guess that's a win.

00:41:58,226 --> 00:42:00,554
Mm.

00:42:29,891 --> 00:42:31,893
There you go.

00:42:31,893 --> 00:42:33,551
What are you doing?

00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:36,865
You won the bet.

00:42:36,865 --> 00:42:38,433
No, all bets are off.

00:42:38,433 --> 00:42:39,555
Nobody wins here.
