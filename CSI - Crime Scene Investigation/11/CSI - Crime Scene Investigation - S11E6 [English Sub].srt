00:00:05,159 --> 00:00:07,664
(deep growl)

00:00:07,664 --> 00:00:09,663
(thudding)

00:00:13,234 --> 00:00:15,269
(footsteps thudding)

00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:18,606
(growling)

00:00:18,606 --> 00:00:20,608
(rumbling snarl)

00:00:27,663 --> 00:00:29,659
(anxious gasping)

00:00:29,659 --> 00:00:31,118
(screaming)

00:00:33,454 --> 00:00:35,623
(indistinct police radio
communication)

00:00:35,623 --> 00:00:37,224
Animal predation.

00:00:37,224 --> 00:00:39,226
Coyotes.

00:00:39,226 --> 00:00:41,295
Plenty of them out here,
but I didn't see any

00:00:41,295 --> 00:00:42,668
when I spotted the body
from the road.

00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:44,663
There's no vital response
in the wounds,

00:00:44,663 --> 00:00:45,668
so the feast
was postmortem.

00:00:45,668 --> 00:00:48,235
And they had plenty
of time to chow down.

00:00:48,235 --> 00:00:51,405
Body temp places TOD
four to eight hours ago.

00:00:51,405 --> 00:00:55,109
Hey, did you know that
coyotes won't eat the flesh

00:00:55,109 --> 00:00:56,143
of crystal
meth users?
Really?

00:00:56,143 --> 00:00:57,244
PHILLIPS:
It's true. It's true.

00:00:57,244 --> 00:00:59,661
I read it. They can sense
that the stuff is poison.

00:00:59,661 --> 00:01:02,116
Well, that places them
at a higher evolutionary mark

00:01:02,116 --> 00:01:04,118
than a good deal
of human beings.

00:01:14,328 --> 00:01:15,659
What you got, Ray?

00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:19,662
Looks like a nylon bag
with some bits of Styrofoam.

00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:21,001
I'll get it to Hodges.

00:01:21,001 --> 00:01:24,972
There's no wallet,
there's no I.D.

00:01:24,972 --> 00:01:26,307
Just his keys.

00:01:26,307 --> 00:01:27,975
Anything printed
on the keychain?

00:01:27,975 --> 00:01:30,377
If found eaten by animals,
please call...

00:01:30,377 --> 00:01:31,378
David.

00:01:31,378 --> 00:01:33,280
Sorry. Ink's worn off.

00:01:37,618 --> 00:01:38,665
Can you help me roll him?

00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:40,487
Sure.

00:01:51,565 --> 00:01:53,133
LANGSTON:
Multiple puncture wounds
to the abdomen.

00:01:53,133 --> 00:01:54,663
Bullet wounds?

00:01:55,664 --> 00:01:57,660
Look at the spacing
of the wounds.

00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,341
What do you notice?

00:02:00,341 --> 00:02:01,976
Well, they're uniform.

00:02:01,976 --> 00:02:04,144
That's right.
They're uniform.

00:02:04,144 --> 00:02:05,379
So what are you thinking?

00:02:05,379 --> 00:02:07,381
The regular spacing,

00:02:07,381 --> 00:02:08,663
the curvilinear pattern
of the punctures...

00:02:08,663 --> 00:02:11,018
This is what you would
expect from a bite mark.

00:02:11,018 --> 00:02:13,659
A bite mark.

00:02:13,659 --> 00:02:15,189
From what?

00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:18,500
Godzilla.

this so-called bite wasn't
what killed your Desert Doe.

00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:05,663
COD was diffuse axonal
injury of the brain,

00:03:05,663 --> 00:03:08,309
typically caused by
the sudden deceleration

00:03:08,309 --> 00:03:11,412
associated with a car crash,
or a significant fall.

00:03:11,412 --> 00:03:14,148
Body stops, brain has momentum,
bad things happen.

00:03:14,148 --> 00:03:16,659
As for the, uh,
puncturing implements,

00:03:16,659 --> 00:03:20,120
they perforated the skin,
subcutaneous fat,

00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:24,458
abdominal muscle,
and the peritoneum.

00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:26,327
And they were each at
least three inches long.

00:03:26,327 --> 00:03:28,395
And approximately an inch wide,
based on the abrasion rings

00:03:28,395 --> 00:03:30,130
around the wounds.

00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:34,301
Anything with teeth
and jaws that size

00:03:34,301 --> 00:03:37,471
has been extinct for...
65 million years?

00:03:37,471 --> 00:03:41,659
True. Uh, that is, for the past
64 million years and 51 weeks.

00:03:41,659 --> 00:03:43,663
However, not this week.

00:03:43,663 --> 00:03:46,513
The cloth bag that you found
with the little white balls?

00:03:46,513 --> 00:03:48,983
The bag is made
of custom spandex,

00:03:48,983 --> 00:03:52,664
the balls are expanded
polystyrene foam.

00:03:52,664 --> 00:03:54,663
Both, I discovered,
are components used by

00:03:54,663 --> 00:03:56,665
an Australian-based
entertainment company

00:03:56,665 --> 00:04:00,594
to construct...
simulated muscle.

00:04:03,163 --> 00:04:05,660
Simulated muscle
for what?

00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,663
For possibly the coolest thing
I've ever heard of,

00:04:07,663 --> 00:04:09,659
which has been residing
at the Las Vegas Arena

00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:12,239
for the past week, and please,
can we just go now?

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,075
Please. Go now.

00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:13,400
Detective Reed.

00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,303
Gardener spotted him
through the window.

00:05:16,303 --> 00:05:18,659
Meet Phil Kohler.

00:05:18,659 --> 00:05:20,974
His card says
"Investment Strategist,"

00:05:20,974 --> 00:05:23,277
the hole in his head
says "exit strategy."

00:05:23,277 --> 00:05:26,668
Body temp indicates TOD
was sometime last night.

00:05:26,668 --> 00:05:30,250
We didn't find a note,
so no telling what torments

00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,667
of finance or fairway drove this
country clubber to cash out.

00:05:34,388 --> 00:05:36,256
His daughter was murdered.

00:05:36,256 --> 00:05:38,125
Excuse me?

00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:39,960
Oh, that's right.

00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,295
Whitney Kohler.

00:05:41,295 --> 00:05:42,596
Five years ago.

00:05:42,596 --> 00:05:45,265
She and her best friend,
Rachel Beck, they were 15.

00:05:45,265 --> 00:05:46,663
Went to the mall together
one day,

00:05:46,663 --> 00:05:48,666
never came back.

00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:50,660
Couple of days later,

00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:53,073
we found Whitney's blood
in a suspect's van.

00:05:53,073 --> 00:05:55,660
He's now serving life,
but the bodies were never found.

00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:06,086
Yeah, I met Phil
a couple of times.

00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,423
He and his wife.
Sharon.

00:06:10,664 --> 00:06:13,293
Divorce papers.

00:06:16,463 --> 00:06:18,298
No stellate tearing
around the wound.

00:06:20,659 --> 00:06:25,139
Random powder particles
dispersed all over his face.

00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:26,663
So the gun had to have been held

00:06:26,663 --> 00:06:29,009
at least a foot or two
away from his head.

00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:31,445
It's unusual for suicide.

00:06:35,983 --> 00:06:40,621
Looks like he had some
brunette company.

00:06:40,621 --> 00:06:43,423
I don't see his wife
in any of these photos, but...

00:06:43,423 --> 00:06:44,664
I think she was a brunette.

00:06:44,664 --> 00:06:47,427
We've got possible
signs of a struggle.

00:06:52,099 --> 00:06:53,664
(grunting)

00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:02,664
Phil has the same gold watch on
in every picture.

00:07:06,046 --> 00:07:08,182
Well, he's not wearing it now.

00:07:08,182 --> 00:07:10,659
Okay.

00:07:10,659 --> 00:07:12,659
I'm going to have
a look around the house,

00:07:12,659 --> 00:07:14,661
see what else was taken
from this guy.

00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:20,659
I bought that watch
for Phil 20 years ago.

00:07:20,659 --> 00:07:23,230
Waddled into the jewelry
store nine months pregnant,

00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:26,662
maxing out the credit card.

00:07:26,662 --> 00:07:28,666
Phil was going
to be a father.

00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:33,662
What does the watch have to do
with what happened to Phil?

00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:35,309
We didn't find it in his house.

00:07:35,309 --> 00:07:37,660
And it's listed among
the disputed possessions

00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,079
in your divorce paperwork.

00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:44,318
I have no idea what happened
to Phil, or his watch.

00:07:44,318 --> 00:07:46,053
I haven't spoken
to him in months.

00:07:46,053 --> 00:07:50,257
Ms. Kohler, you listed adultery

00:07:50,257 --> 00:07:53,665
as the grounds
when you filed for divorce.

00:07:53,665 --> 00:07:56,666
Do you have names of any
other women in Phil's life?

00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:59,299
Just one.

00:07:59,299 --> 00:08:00,662
Carly Beck.

00:08:00,662 --> 00:08:02,664
You mean...

00:08:02,664 --> 00:08:06,473
the mother of
the other missing girl?

00:08:06,473 --> 00:08:08,665
Rachel's mom?

00:08:08,665 --> 00:08:11,659
Yeah.

00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:14,348
I walked in on them
six months ago.

00:08:14,348 --> 00:08:16,450
Shared grief,
Phil called it.

00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,989
Who knew grief could push
two people together?

00:08:21,989 --> 00:08:24,992
I'd only seen it tear
everything apart.

00:08:26,193 --> 00:08:28,228
SANDERS:
Using the Glock
that killed Phil Kohler,

00:08:28,228 --> 00:08:30,667
I fired a distance
determination pattern.

00:08:30,667 --> 00:08:34,968
Found that the muzzle had
to be between 36 to 48 inches

00:08:34,968 --> 00:08:36,570
from Kohler's forehead
when fired.

00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:39,659
His arm is only 30 inches long.

00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:41,662
That's murder.

00:08:41,662 --> 00:08:43,577
The gun's unregistered.
Henry...

00:08:43,577 --> 00:08:45,661
any luck on
the mystery brunette?

00:08:45,661 --> 00:08:47,314
Well, mystery no longer.

00:08:47,314 --> 00:08:49,660
The hair was a maternal match
to a known DNA profile.

00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:52,666
And it wasn't the wife.

00:08:54,321 --> 00:08:56,623
The hair's Carly Beck's.

00:09:01,495 --> 00:09:05,664
Carly Beck, LVPD!
Open the door!

00:09:09,169 --> 00:09:12,439
Hey, so back at
the vic's house-- my big mouth.

00:09:12,439 --> 00:09:15,542
I didn't realize
that you'd known the family.

00:09:15,542 --> 00:09:17,477
Ah, it's okay.
Don't worry about it.

00:09:17,477 --> 00:09:20,147
'Cause I've been working
on my sensitivity.

00:09:59,659 --> 00:10:02,322
Missing daughter's room goes
untouched for five years,

00:10:02,322 --> 00:10:04,660
but it's pretty obvious
there's been a few items

00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,326
removed here recently.

00:10:06,326 --> 00:10:08,228
Can you tell what?

00:10:08,228 --> 00:10:10,497
There's a new package
of photo paper there.

00:10:11,965 --> 00:10:15,660
But I don't see a computer
or printer anywhere.

00:10:18,338 --> 00:10:20,340
(Velcro opening)

00:10:30,016 --> 00:10:33,019
REED:
Is that Carly's daughter?

00:10:33,019 --> 00:10:35,255
I thought you said
the body was never found.

00:10:35,255 --> 00:10:37,664
We never found
either one of the girls.

00:10:37,664 --> 00:10:40,327
But Carly's daughter
was wearing a gray sweatshirt

00:10:40,327 --> 00:10:41,995
when she went missing.

00:10:41,995 --> 00:10:45,499
Whitney Kohler
was the one wearing purple.

00:10:51,338 --> 00:10:53,974
(recorded birds
twittering, calling)

00:10:53,974 --> 00:10:59,112
(door clicks open, then shuts)

00:11:03,661 --> 00:11:06,319
Welcome to<i>Walking</i>
<i>with Dinosaurs.</i>

00:11:06,319 --> 00:11:09,222
17 life-sized prehistoric beasts

00:11:09,222 --> 00:11:10,662
touring the world
in a show

00:11:10,662 --> 00:11:15,429
that spans 180 million years
in history in 90 minutes.

00:11:15,429 --> 00:11:16,660
I'm the tour manager,
Kyle Adams.

00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:17,662
Ray Langston.

00:11:17,662 --> 00:11:20,267
And this is David Hodges.

00:11:20,267 --> 00:11:22,666
Now I heard you gentlemen
are with the crime lab?

00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:23,970
Yes.

00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:25,138
How can I help you?

00:11:25,138 --> 00:11:26,440
One of them ate a guy.

00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,308
(laughs):
I'm sorry?

00:11:28,308 --> 00:11:31,011
We found a victim who
exhibited some, um,

00:11:31,011 --> 00:11:32,612
unique puncture wounds.

00:11:32,612 --> 00:11:35,549
We think the injury
may have occurred here.

00:11:35,549 --> 00:11:37,667
Do you recognize
this young man?

00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,666
We'd like to examine

00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,523
some of the
creatures' mouths.

00:11:43,523 --> 00:11:44,991
We're also going
to need to see

00:11:44,991 --> 00:11:46,593
a couple of them
fight each other.

00:11:48,663 --> 00:11:50,363
No, we're not.

00:11:52,098 --> 00:11:53,133
Come on. Please?

00:11:53,133 --> 00:11:54,434
Maybe just a little.

00:11:58,659 --> 00:12:00,662
(low growling)

00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:08,281
(huffs, snarls)

00:12:14,054 --> 00:12:15,489
(raspy growls)

00:12:15,489 --> 00:12:16,665
(both screeching)

00:12:16,665 --> 00:12:18,665
(both snarling,
servomotors whirring)

00:12:20,665 --> 00:12:23,029
(quiet huff)

00:12:23,029 --> 00:12:25,660
(deep, rumbling growl)

00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:28,502
(growling)

00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:02,569
(mechanism hisses,
clicks, whirrs)

00:13:10,577 --> 00:13:12,662
(clicking, whirring)

00:13:12,662 --> 00:13:14,668
(deep growling)

00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:21,054
The blood from the T rex's mouth
is definitely human,

00:13:21,054 --> 00:13:23,557
and its bottom teeth
match the wounds on our victim.

00:13:23,557 --> 00:13:25,225
That doesn't
make sense.

00:13:25,225 --> 00:13:28,061
It takes three people
to operate the T rex.

00:13:28,061 --> 00:13:30,030
<i>A chassis driver,</i>

00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:32,265
<i>a remote operator</i>
<i>to control major movements,</i>

00:13:32,265 --> 00:13:35,001
<i>and a second</i>
<i>auxiliary operator.</i>

00:13:35,001 --> 00:13:37,270
And the T rex operators know
everyone wants a chance

00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,659
to manipulate the big beast,

00:13:38,659 --> 00:13:40,663
so they lock their control rigs
up after the show.

00:13:40,663 --> 00:13:42,667
Nobody was in the arena
after hours?

00:13:42,667 --> 00:13:45,178
The entire crew went out for
dinner, then back to our hotel.

00:13:45,178 --> 00:13:46,662
Overnight security?

00:13:46,662 --> 00:13:48,660
The place was supposed
to be locked up,

00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,984
but I guess
we were wrong.

00:13:50,984 --> 00:13:53,520
(phone ringing)
Excuse me.

00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,665
This is Langston.

00:13:54,665 --> 00:13:55,665
It's Henry.

00:13:55,665 --> 00:13:57,662
I got an I.D.
on your Dino Doe.

00:13:57,662 --> 00:13:59,666
A Video Spec allowed me
to recreate the text

00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:01,294
on the vic's keychain.

00:14:01,294 --> 00:14:05,465
It's a logo of the WLVU
paleontology program.

00:14:05,465 --> 00:14:09,502
A professor I.D.'d the vic
as Brian Lister,

00:14:09,502 --> 00:14:12,665
a student specializing
in herbivorous dinosaurs.

00:14:12,665 --> 00:14:14,507
Not a big fan of the predators.

00:14:14,507 --> 00:14:15,667
I wonder why.

00:14:15,667 --> 00:14:18,311
Anyway, his fiancée is another
student in the program.

00:14:18,311 --> 00:14:19,663
We're bringing her in.

00:14:19,663 --> 00:14:21,982
Oh, if you need anything,
let me know.

00:14:21,982 --> 00:14:23,283
Hodges had to go home sick.

00:14:23,283 --> 00:14:25,118
Sick?

00:14:29,155 --> 00:14:31,324
(mechanism whirring,
dinosaur purring)

00:14:35,328 --> 00:14:37,668
WILLOWS:
<i>We have a broadcast out</i>

00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,662
on Carly Beck's vehicle.

00:14:39,662 --> 00:14:41,662
No known employer.

00:14:41,662 --> 00:14:43,662
What do we have from the photo?

00:14:43,662 --> 00:14:45,372
Fingerprints on it
belong to both

00:14:45,372 --> 00:14:47,140
Carly Beck and
Phil Kohler.

00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,608
The photo was printed

00:14:48,608 --> 00:14:52,245
on the same paper stock that
Nick found in Carly's house.

00:14:52,245 --> 00:14:54,662
Yeah, but there was no computer,
printer or camera over there.

00:14:54,662 --> 00:14:56,483
Could have been
the items removed

00:14:56,483 --> 00:14:57,666
from her daughter's room.

00:14:57,666 --> 00:15:01,667
Somehow she printed it;
she brings it to Phil Kohler.

00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:06,666
For some reason they struggle,
Phil gets shot, Carly flees.

00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:10,363
So if you bring a man a photo
of his dead daughter,

00:15:10,363 --> 00:15:13,400
what are you trying to do,
confront him?

00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,335
Or extort him.

00:15:15,335 --> 00:15:16,660
Stolen watch.

00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,138
She may have been
after money.

00:15:18,138 --> 00:15:19,660
We don't know that.

00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,667
So the bigger question is:

00:15:21,667 --> 00:15:24,660
if Carly Beck knows
where Whitney's body is,

00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,414
does that mean she was
involved in her death?

00:15:27,414 --> 00:15:29,215
Eli Holt killed both
of those girls.

00:15:29,215 --> 00:15:30,664
Whitney's blood
was in his van.

00:15:30,664 --> 00:15:32,285
Mall surveillance
has him circling the lot,

00:15:32,285 --> 00:15:34,254
approaching other girls.

00:15:34,254 --> 00:15:36,661
But clearly, Carly has some
information that we don't.

00:15:36,661 --> 00:15:38,664
And she didn't
share it with us.

00:15:38,664 --> 00:15:40,493
You're right.

00:15:40,493 --> 00:15:41,660
What about
Carly's daughter Rachel?

00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:44,998
If Carly knows
where Whitney's buried,

00:15:44,998 --> 00:15:47,233
has she known this whole time
where Rachel is?

00:15:47,233 --> 00:15:49,660
No. No, I dealt with Carly
back then,

00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,304
when her daughter went missing.

00:15:51,304 --> 00:15:53,664
Everybody is talking
about the other girl.

00:15:53,664 --> 00:15:55,375
Those girls are
best friends.

00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:56,662
They went to the mall together.

00:15:56,662 --> 00:15:58,666
That man took them both!
Ms. Beck...

00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,661
Why isn't anybody looking
for my daughter?!

00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:03,149
Because we're not
the ones with money?!

00:16:03,149 --> 00:16:05,051
Because we're not the ones
who know people?!

00:16:05,051 --> 00:16:06,619
No. Now, I go 110%
on every case,

00:16:06,619 --> 00:16:08,388
but all I can work with
is the evidence,

00:16:08,388 --> 00:16:11,661
and there's only evidence
of Whitney in that man's van.

00:16:11,661 --> 00:16:13,664
Listen, I'm doing everything
I can, I promise...

00:16:13,664 --> 00:16:15,095
That isn't enough!

00:16:15,095 --> 00:16:16,666
(knocking on glass)

00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:21,101
I've analyzed the photo
of Whitney Kohler.

00:16:21,101 --> 00:16:22,668
The victim exhibits

00:16:22,668 --> 00:16:26,139
skeletonization
and mummified tissue.

00:16:26,139 --> 00:16:28,041
It's consistent
with our hot, dry climate.

00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:29,664
If she was killed
five years ago,

00:16:29,664 --> 00:16:32,663
it's possible
Whitney Kohler's been in

00:16:32,663 --> 00:16:35,548
this state of decomposition
the past four and a half years.

00:16:35,548 --> 00:16:38,251
The photo could have been taken
any time in that span.

00:16:38,251 --> 00:16:40,220
The entire time
Holt's been in prison.

00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:43,323
Holt could have told anyone
where that body's buried.

00:16:43,323 --> 00:16:45,663
A visitor, another inmate.

00:16:45,663 --> 00:16:47,560
We got to go talk to him.

00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,597
BRASS:
Well, Eli Holt's in a coma.

00:16:50,597 --> 00:16:52,432
Attempted suicide ten days ago.

00:16:52,432 --> 00:16:53,433
Why now?

00:16:53,433 --> 00:16:54,664
What set him off?
I don't know.

00:16:54,664 --> 00:16:56,666
The prison guards certainly
didn't have any idea.

00:16:56,666 --> 00:17:00,668
But the prison sent over
his communication record.

00:17:00,668 --> 00:17:02,663
It turns out
that Carly Beck

00:17:02,663 --> 00:17:05,211
was writing him
a lot of letters.

00:17:05,211 --> 00:17:06,663
But there's no indication
that Holt ever responded.

00:17:06,663 --> 00:17:08,114
"Dear Mr. Holt,

00:17:08,114 --> 00:17:10,183
"I'd do anything for you
if you'd just tell me

00:17:10,183 --> 00:17:11,666
where my Rachel's body is"?

00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:13,486
Yeah, there's
a lot of that.

00:17:13,486 --> 00:17:16,663
Okay, help me figure this out.

00:17:16,663 --> 00:17:19,459
Holt attempts suicide.

00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:23,659
Ten days later, the father of
one of his victims gets killed,

00:17:23,659 --> 00:17:26,432
after being shown a picture
of his dead daughter

00:17:26,432 --> 00:17:28,659
by the other victim's mother.

00:17:28,659 --> 00:17:31,171
Right.

00:17:31,171 --> 00:17:33,665
What are we missing?

00:17:33,665 --> 00:17:36,666
SANDERS: There was more to the
picture of Whitney Kohler.

00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:39,667
I enhanced a billboard
in the distant background.

00:17:41,281 --> 00:17:43,668
A rep for the
advertising company

00:17:43,668 --> 00:17:46,119
told me that this real estate
agent recently placed

00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:48,665
five of the same signs
around Vegas.

00:17:48,665 --> 00:17:50,668
Any in a rural location
like the photo?

00:17:50,668 --> 00:17:52,058
Just one.

00:17:52,058 --> 00:17:56,659
On Highway 16,
near mile marker 20.

00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:58,198
I was thinking Nick and I

00:17:58,198 --> 00:18:02,368
<i>can head out there, visually</i>
<i>recreate the distance from</i>

00:18:02,368 --> 00:18:06,372
<i>and vantage of the billboard</i>
<i>in the photo.</i>

00:18:06,372 --> 00:18:09,475
<i>We might find something.</i>

00:18:38,104 --> 00:18:40,106
(sighs)

00:18:47,547 --> 00:18:49,666
(camera clicking)

00:18:57,664 --> 00:19:01,094
Based on her broken hyoid,
C.O.D. was strangulation.

00:19:01,094 --> 00:19:02,661
Mm-hmm.

00:19:02,661 --> 00:19:06,665
But that wasn't all
her killer did to her.

00:19:06,665 --> 00:19:09,602
He severed two of her fingers,
partially severed a third.

00:19:09,602 --> 00:19:12,661
An abandoned attempt
to obscure her identity.

00:19:12,661 --> 00:19:14,440
Or she was tortured.

00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,666
Well, whatever
the twisted impetus,

00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:17,662
I can tell you
the twisted implement.

00:19:17,662 --> 00:19:21,114
Width of the kerf mark
on the bone was approximately

00:19:21,114 --> 00:19:22,667
30,000ths of an inch wide.

00:19:22,667 --> 00:19:27,453
That correlates to
a hacksaw or a band saw.

00:19:27,453 --> 00:19:29,661
But the consistency and
directionality of the cut

00:19:29,661 --> 00:19:31,524
has me leaning
toward band saw.

00:19:31,524 --> 00:19:33,493
Band saw's a heavy
piece of equipment.

00:19:33,493 --> 00:19:34,668
Fixed in one place.

00:19:34,668 --> 00:19:38,164
Where could Holt have had access
to a saw like that?

00:19:38,164 --> 00:19:41,434
So no one was looking
for a band saw five years ago,

00:19:41,434 --> 00:19:43,662
but I reinterviewed
Eli Holt's cousins,

00:19:43,662 --> 00:19:45,438
and they told me
about this place.

00:19:45,438 --> 00:19:46,973
Belonged to Eli's Uncle Bill.

00:19:46,973 --> 00:19:48,508
He died four years ago.

00:19:48,508 --> 00:19:50,209
Went into probate, no takers.

00:19:50,209 --> 00:19:52,663
Yeah, yeah, I interviewed
the uncle during
the investigation.

00:19:52,663 --> 00:19:54,580
He was practically
on his death bed.

00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,449
Said he hadn't seen Eli
in like ten years.

00:19:56,449 --> 00:19:57,663
Family falling out.

00:19:57,663 --> 00:19:59,661
But Eli used to come here
as a kid,

00:19:59,661 --> 00:20:01,554
work with his uncle
in the wood shop.

00:20:01,554 --> 00:20:02,989
With his uncle sick,
five years ago

00:20:02,989 --> 00:20:05,558
maybe Eli came back with
some projects of his own.

00:20:45,064 --> 00:20:48,334
And we've got a primary.

00:21:00,213 --> 00:21:02,382
You think Uncle Bill
had any idea

00:21:02,382 --> 00:21:04,050
what Eli was doing out here?

00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:07,520
Just left
all this evidence behind?

00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,255
No, I doubt it.

00:21:09,255 --> 00:21:13,426
He was probably sneaking
his victims in at night.

00:21:13,426 --> 00:21:17,497
Meant to come back
and clean all this stuff up,

00:21:17,497 --> 00:21:20,199
but got caught before
he could get around to it.

00:21:20,199 --> 00:21:22,368
Yeah. Nobody's been
out here since.

00:21:27,373 --> 00:21:30,343
I remember when the girls
first went missing.

00:21:30,343 --> 00:21:32,660
It was one of my first weeks
out in the field.

00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:35,148
It wasn't even my case,
but I felt like

00:21:35,148 --> 00:21:37,483
I should have been doing
something more to help.

00:21:37,483 --> 00:21:43,089
Yeah, well, some cases it never
feels like you're doing enough.

00:21:44,659 --> 00:21:46,666
These tools are ancient,

00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:48,528
except for this shovel.

00:21:48,528 --> 00:21:50,396
It's got a
fiberglass handle.

00:21:50,396 --> 00:21:53,966
Holt could have purchased it
to bury Whitney.

00:22:07,664 --> 00:22:09,449
And Rachel, too.

00:22:20,662 --> 00:22:24,397
Brian was so excited to take me

00:22:24,397 --> 00:22:26,265
to<i>Walking with Dinosaurs</i>
last night.

00:22:26,265 --> 00:22:27,665
And the show was amazing.

00:22:27,665 --> 00:22:31,471
<i>Just to see our beloved</i>
<i>Brachiosaurus come to life.</i>

00:22:31,471 --> 00:22:33,665
(dinosaurs bleating)

00:22:33,665 --> 00:22:35,667
<i>With its long</i>
<i>and graceful neck</i>

00:22:35,667 --> 00:22:39,659
<i>and its gentle energy.</i>

00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:41,614
What happened after the show?

00:22:41,614 --> 00:22:45,668
Brian took me back to my dorm.

00:22:45,668 --> 00:22:48,668
And that's the last
I saw of him.

00:22:48,668 --> 00:22:51,190
But we were going to
build a life together.

00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:52,665
We were going to travel
the world,

00:22:52,665 --> 00:22:55,428
learning the lessons
of the great leaf-eaters.

00:22:55,428 --> 00:22:56,562
Jane, um,

00:22:56,562 --> 00:22:59,465
the crew from
<i>Walking with Dinosaurs</i>

00:22:59,465 --> 00:23:01,434
sent over some video
of last night's show.

00:23:01,434 --> 00:23:04,667
I was able to find
you and Brian in the crowd.

00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:06,372
Now...

00:23:06,372 --> 00:23:10,576
you didn't mention
this part of the evening.

00:23:10,576 --> 00:23:11,662
ANNOUNCER:
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:23:11,662 --> 00:23:13,659
<i>Tyrannosaurus rex!</i>

00:23:13,659 --> 00:23:14,664
(crowd cheering)

00:23:14,664 --> 00:23:16,662
I didn't think it was relevant.

00:23:16,662 --> 00:23:19,051
(roaring)

00:23:19,051 --> 00:23:21,254
Ladies and gentlemen,
<i>Tyrannosaurus rex!</i>

00:23:23,256 --> 00:23:24,660
I'm gonna go forage

00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,425
for some vegan concessions.

00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:34,000
<i>I couldn't take my eyes</i>
<i>off that hideous beast.</i>

00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,660
<i>Its obscene jawline.</i>

00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,663
<i>Its throbbing musculature.</i>

00:23:41,474 --> 00:23:43,664
You know, the T rex
was so active,

00:23:43,664 --> 00:23:46,579
so relentlessly physical,

00:23:46,579 --> 00:23:49,282
that it may have been
one of the few dinos

00:23:49,282 --> 00:23:52,660
whose blood pumped... warm.

00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,664
(crowd cheering,
dinosaur roaring)

00:24:03,664 --> 00:24:05,598
Who is this guy?

00:24:05,598 --> 00:24:07,133
I don't know.

00:24:07,133 --> 00:24:08,334
And it doesn't matter.

00:24:08,334 --> 00:24:10,667
I was swallowed up
by the carnivorous moment.

00:24:10,667 --> 00:24:13,668
But it was just a moment.

00:24:13,668 --> 00:24:17,276
Because Brian and the other
long-necked herbivores--

00:24:17,276 --> 00:24:19,011
those are my true loves.

00:24:23,661 --> 00:24:26,052
Yeah...

00:24:26,052 --> 00:24:29,222
22 pounds of
bite force.

00:24:29,222 --> 00:24:33,226
Same as the animatronic
T rex's jaws.

00:24:35,094 --> 00:24:37,597
So did you get this at
the toy store or, uh...?

00:24:37,597 --> 00:24:40,668
Actually, it's on loan
from an old colleague at WLVU.

00:24:40,668 --> 00:24:42,665
(chuckles)

00:24:45,104 --> 00:24:47,106
All right, let's see.

00:24:53,379 --> 00:24:54,666
Barely wounded.

00:24:54,666 --> 00:24:56,661
That means a bite
from the T rex

00:24:56,661 --> 00:25:00,353
couldn't have caused
Brian Lister's wounds.

00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:04,624
But Brian's blood was
in the mouth of the T rex,

00:25:04,624 --> 00:25:07,159
and the bottom teeth are
a perfect match to his wounds.

00:25:07,159 --> 00:25:09,061
All right, so if
the creature couldn't have

00:25:09,061 --> 00:25:11,530
bitten Brian with
sufficient force, then...

00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:13,659
It was staged or additional
force would have

00:25:13,659 --> 00:25:15,301
had to have come
from somewhere else.

00:25:17,336 --> 00:25:20,506
Let's say that Brian supplied
the additional force.

00:25:20,506 --> 00:25:21,666
He brought the momentum
to the monster.

00:25:21,666 --> 00:25:22,666
Correct.

00:25:22,666 --> 00:25:24,659
Doc Robbins said
his brain injuries

00:25:24,659 --> 00:25:26,545
were consistent with a fall.

00:25:26,545 --> 00:25:28,481
And since his back
was scavenged,

00:25:28,481 --> 00:25:32,051
we don't actually know if
he had any injuries on his back

00:25:32,051 --> 00:25:33,252
from the upper teeth.

00:25:33,252 --> 00:25:35,668
He may have simply fallen
onto the lower teeth.

00:25:35,668 --> 00:25:37,665
Well, if that's the case,

00:25:37,665 --> 00:25:40,159
then he would've fallen
from some great height.

00:25:57,977 --> 00:26:00,660
These are the parked positions
of the dinosaurs

00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,662
in which they stand overnight.

00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,660
Got some fibers in her lip.

00:26:18,097 --> 00:26:21,500
It's the same blue and yellow
from our victim's shirt.

00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,661
How could he have
gotten up there?

00:26:22,661 --> 00:26:24,470
Same way I did.

00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:26,105
If Brian snuck in,

00:26:26,105 --> 00:26:28,374
and the crane was here,

00:26:28,374 --> 00:26:30,667
fall from this height

00:26:30,667 --> 00:26:33,079
certainly would've
gotten the job done.

00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:35,660
(screaming)
<i>Question is:</i>

00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,483
what made him fall?

00:26:41,667 --> 00:26:43,522
Phil Kohler's watch.

00:26:43,522 --> 00:26:45,558
Got a hit on
the pawnshop registry.

00:26:45,558 --> 00:26:46,992
Shop owner said he bought it

00:26:46,992 --> 00:26:49,462
off a lady around noon,
confirmed that it was Carly Beck

00:26:49,462 --> 00:26:51,297
off of a photo.

00:26:53,299 --> 00:26:54,660
How much money did he give her?

00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,402
1,500 bucks for the watch.

00:26:56,402 --> 00:26:58,662
He also said she came in
a week ago.

00:26:58,662 --> 00:27:00,666
Sold him five G's
worth of stuff.

00:27:00,666 --> 00:27:02,975
A truck and
all this junk.

00:27:02,975 --> 00:27:06,445
This has got to be
from Rachel's bedroom.

00:27:08,481 --> 00:27:10,316
Scavenging through
her dead daughter's room,

00:27:10,316 --> 00:27:11,663
blowing through five grand
in a week

00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:13,152
and coming back for more?

00:27:13,152 --> 00:27:14,387
What is Carly Beck into?

00:27:14,387 --> 00:27:15,662
She brought something
else in today.

00:27:15,662 --> 00:27:16,668
Camera.

00:27:18,664 --> 00:27:20,661
Pawnbroker said that
she was begging him

00:27:20,661 --> 00:27:22,661
to buy an old computer,
printer and her car, too,

00:27:22,661 --> 00:27:23,666
but he passed.

00:27:23,666 --> 00:27:24,666
Car? You should...

00:27:24,666 --> 00:27:26,098
I've already got
calls going out

00:27:26,098 --> 00:27:27,533
to used car dealers in the area,

00:27:27,533 --> 00:27:29,001
seeing if she's trying
to unload it.

00:27:33,659 --> 00:27:36,976
She ditched
the memory card.

00:27:36,976 --> 00:27:38,661
Everything must go.

00:27:42,081 --> 00:27:45,618
Catherine, I got the DNA
results from the wood shop.

00:27:45,618 --> 00:27:47,666
The blood contributions
were from both girls,

00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,422
on the saw and
on the floor.

00:27:49,422 --> 00:27:51,663
Okay. Well, we just got a hit
on Carly Beck's vehicle.

00:27:51,663 --> 00:27:54,666
She sold it 15 minutes ago
to a used car lot for cash

00:27:54,666 --> 00:27:56,659
and then just
walked away from the lot.

00:27:56,659 --> 00:27:58,564
Well, she couldn't have
gotten that far on foot.

00:27:58,564 --> 00:27:59,667
Patrol's canvassing
the area.

00:27:59,667 --> 00:28:03,068
(kids chattering playfully)

00:28:17,383 --> 00:28:19,018
(siren whoops)

00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:28,668
Police!

00:28:28,668 --> 00:28:30,496
It's my last chance!

00:28:30,496 --> 00:28:31,662
(panting)

00:28:37,303 --> 00:28:39,238
(sobbing):
It's my last chance!

00:28:39,238 --> 00:28:41,273
OFFICER:
It's okay, ma'am.

00:28:41,273 --> 00:28:42,475
(handcuffs clicking)

00:28:42,475 --> 00:28:44,043
OFFICER:
It's all right, ma'am.

00:28:44,043 --> 00:28:47,246
It's my last chance!

00:29:02,495 --> 00:29:04,661
CARLY:
<i>I didn't kill Phil Kohler.</i>

00:29:04,661 --> 00:29:06,599
BRASS:
<i>Come on, you were with him.</i>

00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:07,665
You ripped off his watch.

00:29:07,665 --> 00:29:09,068
Come on.

00:29:09,068 --> 00:29:10,269
That's not what...

00:29:10,269 --> 00:29:11,665
I-I didn't kill him.

00:29:11,665 --> 00:29:13,666
You know me.

00:29:13,666 --> 00:29:15,660
I do.

00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,176
Tell us about the letter, Carly.

00:29:19,211 --> 00:29:23,315
I'd been writing to
Eli Holt, begging him

00:29:23,315 --> 00:29:25,217
to tell me where
my daughter was.

00:29:25,217 --> 00:29:28,020
And for the first time ever,
he wrote back.

00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:31,323
<i>He said he remembered</i>
<i>where the girls were buried,</i>

00:29:31,323 --> 00:29:34,226
<i>but he didn't remember</i>
<i>which girl was in which grave.</i>

00:29:34,226 --> 00:29:37,196
He'd sell me the maps.

00:29:37,196 --> 00:29:38,667
$5,000 for one map.

00:29:38,667 --> 00:29:40,663
$10,000 for both.

00:29:40,663 --> 00:29:43,435
If I told the cops,
the deal was off.

00:29:43,435 --> 00:29:44,660
I'd never find her.

00:29:46,138 --> 00:29:47,473
You pawned everything you could

00:29:47,473 --> 00:29:49,475
to get enough
for one map.

00:29:49,475 --> 00:29:51,510
But it was the wrong one,
wasn't it?

00:29:59,385 --> 00:30:00,666
CARLY:
<i>When my Rachel went missing,</i>

00:30:00,666 --> 00:30:03,355
<i>she was wearing</i>
<i>a gray sweatshirt.</i>

00:30:03,355 --> 00:30:06,191
Whitney was
the one wearing purple.

00:30:06,191 --> 00:30:07,660
You snapped photos of her body.

00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,328
You left her out there
in the desert.

00:30:09,328 --> 00:30:11,230
What, you just didn't think
to tell anybody?

00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:12,364
I told Phil.

00:30:12,364 --> 00:30:13,661
I don't know
what you're doing here.

00:30:13,661 --> 00:30:15,401
I can't see you anymore.
It's about the girls!

00:30:15,401 --> 00:30:16,667
It always is.
But you and I

00:30:16,667 --> 00:30:18,665
need to move on with our lives,
and that's not gonna happen.

00:30:18,665 --> 00:30:20,539
I know where Whitney's buried.

00:30:20,539 --> 00:30:22,341
I-I just need $5,000, and
then I can find Rachel, too.

00:30:22,341 --> 00:30:24,660
I just, I thought you
could lend me the money,

00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,312
and then we'd both
have our girls!
Carly, Carly!

00:30:26,312 --> 00:30:27,662
Whoever's telling you that
is lying to you.

00:30:27,662 --> 00:30:29,381
You know how many false leads
we've gotten.

00:30:29,381 --> 00:30:31,083
They're just preying on you.

00:30:31,083 --> 00:30:32,664
No, it's...
No, it's real, Phil!

00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:36,055
I just need the money.

00:30:36,055 --> 00:30:38,524
It's just another scam.

00:30:38,524 --> 00:30:39,660
I'm calling the police.

00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,060
No! No, no.

00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:43,462
Don't call the police!

00:30:45,497 --> 00:30:48,200
You're just going to get
your heart broken again.

00:30:50,235 --> 00:30:52,037
Get what you can for it.

00:30:53,662 --> 00:30:56,208
Because I can't do this anymore.

00:30:58,243 --> 00:30:59,661
BRASS:
<i>And all this happened</i>

00:30:59,661 --> 00:31:01,447
the night before
Phil was killed?

00:31:01,447 --> 00:31:04,116
After Phil's, I went home.

00:31:04,116 --> 00:31:05,985
The phone rang.

00:31:05,985 --> 00:31:07,661
MAN:
I'm a friend of Eli's.

00:31:07,661 --> 00:31:09,488
Want to know
how the map worked out.

00:31:09,488 --> 00:31:10,659
It wasn't my daughter.

00:31:10,659 --> 00:31:12,324
I want to know
where my daughter is.

00:31:12,324 --> 00:31:14,360
Eli told you the deal.

00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,660
It's five K.

00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:17,664
Same locker at the park.

00:31:17,664 --> 00:31:19,064
Sunset Friday
or the deal's killed.

00:31:19,064 --> 00:31:22,167
I can't get another $5,000.

00:31:22,167 --> 00:31:23,664
I-I went to Whitney's dad.

00:31:23,664 --> 00:31:26,664
He-He didn't believe me;
he thinks it's a scam.

00:31:26,664 --> 00:31:28,666
But I know it's not.

00:31:28,666 --> 00:31:30,109
(line clicks)

00:31:30,109 --> 00:31:33,662
Hello? Hello?

00:31:37,668 --> 00:31:40,586
CARLY:
<i>Honey, Whitney's here.</i>

00:31:40,586 --> 00:31:41,987
<i>You going to the mall?</i>

00:31:41,987 --> 00:31:45,591
(disconnect tone
beeping over phone)

00:31:47,993 --> 00:31:52,598
Please, just get that monster
to tell me where my daughter is.

00:31:52,598 --> 00:31:54,664
When'd you get the first map?

00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:58,663
Holt sent it to me
three days ago.

00:32:04,977 --> 00:32:07,660
Eli Holt has been in a coma
for ten days.

00:32:10,661 --> 00:32:14,253
Then who have I been talking to?

00:32:14,253 --> 00:32:16,388
Who knows where my daughter is?

00:32:25,663 --> 00:32:28,133
LANGSTON: Of course,
it's a little more primal

00:32:28,133 --> 00:32:29,664
when you're perfect strangers.

00:32:29,664 --> 00:32:33,272
(dinosaur growls,
dramatic music plays on video)

00:32:33,272 --> 00:32:37,209
But when you use your credit
card to pay for your ticket,

00:32:37,209 --> 00:32:40,045
you don't remain a stranger
to us, not for very long.

00:32:40,045 --> 00:32:44,583
Travis Kilborn,
seat 42A.

00:32:44,583 --> 00:32:46,351
And, of course,
you knew Jane Lewis

00:32:46,351 --> 00:32:48,667
long before that enchanted
prehistoric evening.

00:32:48,667 --> 00:32:50,222
You both attend
the same

00:32:50,222 --> 00:32:53,592
college paleontology program
with only 12 other students.

00:32:53,592 --> 00:32:54,660
You lied to me, Jane.

00:32:56,295 --> 00:32:58,230
So here's what we have.

00:32:58,230 --> 00:32:59,668
We have dirt in the
tires of your car.

00:32:59,668 --> 00:33:01,233
We have blood in
the backseat.

00:33:01,233 --> 00:33:03,402
We have your prints on the
Brachiosaurus controls.

00:33:03,402 --> 00:33:05,604
So which one of you is going
to tell me what happened?

00:33:09,662 --> 00:33:11,667
One of you had better speak up.

00:33:12,661 --> 00:33:14,113
(sighs heavily)

00:33:14,113 --> 00:33:15,447
Brian just wanted a picture.

00:33:18,083 --> 00:33:20,586
The three of us went
to the show.

00:33:20,586 --> 00:33:23,388
<i>Had a few drinks afterwards,</i>

00:33:23,388 --> 00:33:26,664
<i>and thought it'd be cool</i>
<i>to sneak back into the arena.</i>

00:33:26,664 --> 00:33:30,162
You guys, I need a picture
with the Brachiosaurus.

00:33:31,666 --> 00:33:33,599
Jane, bring it closer.

00:33:34,659 --> 00:33:36,401
Closer.

00:33:36,401 --> 00:33:38,103
Move it!

00:33:38,103 --> 00:33:39,505
(laughs)

00:33:39,505 --> 00:33:41,073
This is awesome.

00:33:41,073 --> 00:33:42,474
Closer, closer, closer.

00:33:42,474 --> 00:33:43,665
TRAVIS:
<i>It was an accident.</i>

00:33:43,665 --> 00:33:45,661
BRIAN:
Take a picture.

00:33:45,661 --> 00:33:47,446
Closer. Closer.

00:33:47,446 --> 00:33:48,447
Closer, closer, closer.

00:33:48,447 --> 00:33:50,115
Little bit more.

00:33:50,115 --> 00:33:52,151
(grunts)

00:33:52,151 --> 00:33:55,220
(screaming)

00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:58,290
TRAVIS:
<i>He was still alive.</i>

00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:00,392
<i>Pushed himself off the teeth,</i>

00:34:00,392 --> 00:34:02,995
<i>then fell all the way</i>
<i>to the floor.</i>

00:34:02,995 --> 00:34:04,963
Brian!

00:34:04,963 --> 00:34:06,965
Brian.

00:34:17,668 --> 00:34:20,660
(quietly):
Oh, God.

00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:25,660
Here. Here.

00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:27,486
Put this on him.

00:34:27,486 --> 00:34:29,054
All right.

00:34:29,054 --> 00:34:30,622
All right, put this over him.

00:34:30,622 --> 00:34:32,291
Put this over him!
Yeah...

00:34:35,662 --> 00:34:37,996
He was my friend.

00:34:37,996 --> 00:34:39,198
Then why not call 911?

00:34:39,198 --> 00:34:40,432
Why dump the body?

00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,269
I panicked.

00:34:44,269 --> 00:34:46,660
I thought we'd be
in trouble.

00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:50,663
I know it was an accident,
but we were trespassing.

00:34:50,663 --> 00:34:52,660
I'm sorry.

00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:56,667
We found one other
thing in your car.

00:34:56,667 --> 00:35:01,019
A burger wrapper
with lipstick on it.

00:35:01,019 --> 00:35:05,557
We, uh, stopped at a place
after we left the desert.

00:35:05,557 --> 00:35:07,459
Jane was starving.

00:35:07,459 --> 00:35:10,095
For red meat.

00:35:11,668 --> 00:35:14,433
They were out of veggie burgers.

00:35:14,433 --> 00:35:16,201
Jane, are you sure
you accidentally

00:35:16,201 --> 00:35:17,536
knocked Brian out of the crane,

00:35:17,536 --> 00:35:19,666
or was a future with him
simply not going

00:35:19,666 --> 00:35:21,664
to satisfy your appetite?

00:35:24,076 --> 00:35:26,578
I want a lawyer.

00:35:29,581 --> 00:35:31,250
STOKES:
<i>So the mail room confirmed</i>

00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:32,484
that the Holt letter
and map

00:35:32,484 --> 00:35:33,661
was stamped
with their postage machine,

00:35:33,661 --> 00:35:34,662
but the postmark indicates

00:35:34,662 --> 00:35:36,555
that it was sent
from outside the prison.

00:35:36,555 --> 00:35:39,191
Well, probably avoiding
the prison mail screening.

00:35:39,191 --> 00:35:42,494
The handwriting on the documents
doesn't even match Holt's.

00:35:42,494 --> 00:35:44,229
You know, he could have told
another inmate

00:35:44,229 --> 00:35:45,564
where the bodies are buried.

00:35:45,564 --> 00:35:47,165
Maybe they're trying to cash in.

00:35:47,165 --> 00:35:50,660
Well, the CO supervisor says
that Holt wasn't a talker.

00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,371
He kept to himself,
mostly.

00:35:52,371 --> 00:35:54,306
Open that up,
will you?

00:35:59,244 --> 00:36:00,666
(sighs)
He have any visitors?

00:36:00,666 --> 00:36:03,415
No, no.
No visitors.

00:36:03,415 --> 00:36:05,617
Apparently,
the most exciting day

00:36:05,617 --> 00:36:07,486
of his week was his, uh,

00:36:07,486 --> 00:36:09,254
tripto the canteen.

00:36:09,254 --> 00:36:10,989
STOKES:
Oh, yeah?

00:36:14,026 --> 00:36:16,228
What did he buy there?

00:36:17,262 --> 00:36:18,660
(clears throat)

00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:21,500
On his last shopping spree,
he bought:

00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:24,659
couple of candy bars,
bottle of soda

00:36:24,659 --> 00:36:26,305
and a notepad.

00:36:28,665 --> 00:36:31,276
Well, here's a yellow notepad.

00:36:36,114 --> 00:36:38,668
It looks like the top
three sheets are missing.

00:36:38,668 --> 00:36:41,659
So he buys a notepad
on the morning

00:36:41,659 --> 00:36:43,355
of the day he tries
to kill himself?

00:36:43,355 --> 00:36:46,491
And what kind of guy writes
a three-page suicide note?

00:36:46,491 --> 00:36:48,665
You can get that done
with one sheet.

00:36:48,665 --> 00:36:51,596
Okay, so a note and two maps.

00:36:51,596 --> 00:36:53,465
Well, according to the, uh,

00:36:53,465 --> 00:36:55,233
responding officer,
Jason Richter,

00:36:55,233 --> 00:36:56,664
there was no suicide note.

00:36:56,664 --> 00:36:59,663
Was the officer alone
when he responded?

00:36:59,663 --> 00:37:00,667
That's a confirm.

00:37:00,667 --> 00:37:02,607
We better go round him up.

00:37:09,314 --> 00:37:11,116
Jason Richter!

00:37:11,116 --> 00:37:13,518
LVPD. Open up.

00:37:13,518 --> 00:37:14,665
(alarm beeping)

00:37:14,665 --> 00:37:16,621
Take the back.

00:37:24,667 --> 00:37:26,661
(alarm beeping)

00:37:29,661 --> 00:37:31,370
Hey! Hey!

00:37:37,976 --> 00:37:40,245
Get down,
or I will end you.

00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:46,084
(alarm beeping)

00:37:46,084 --> 00:37:47,659
It's the second map!

00:37:54,666 --> 00:37:56,667
12 bucks an hour
to have everything

00:37:56,667 --> 00:37:59,664
that comes out of those animals
flung at me?

00:38:01,667 --> 00:38:03,667
(grunting, gasping)

00:38:03,667 --> 00:38:07,662
RICHTER:<i>I shouldn't have been</i>
<i>so quick to help him.</i>

00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:13,078
(grunting)

00:38:20,452 --> 00:38:22,663
<i>I thought the maps might be</i>
<i>to some buried loot.</i>

00:38:25,659 --> 00:38:29,668
(grunting stops)

00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:41,373
Requesting rush medical
to cell 105.

00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:45,277
You knew those maps
led to two dead children,

00:38:45,277 --> 00:38:47,659
and you still found a way
to make a buck.

00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,148
It was just that lady's
crap luck

00:38:50,148 --> 00:38:52,350
the first map
wasn't her daughter.

00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:54,667
Hey... Holt's note

00:38:54,667 --> 00:38:57,668
didn't say which map was which.

00:39:00,158 --> 00:39:02,661
I gave her a fair shot at it.

00:39:02,661 --> 00:39:04,196
A fair shot?

00:39:04,196 --> 00:39:07,299
<i>You took Carly Beck</i>
<i>for five grand.</i>

00:39:07,299 --> 00:39:09,334
CARLY:
I can't get another $5,000.

00:39:09,334 --> 00:39:11,002
I-I-I went to Whitney's dad.

00:39:11,002 --> 00:39:14,973
He... he didn't believe me;
he thinks it's a scam.

00:39:14,973 --> 00:39:16,975
BRASS:
<i>You knew she wouldn't tell.</i>

00:39:16,975 --> 00:39:20,445
You couldn't be so sure
about Phil Kohler.

00:39:22,347 --> 00:39:25,183
So you had to silence him.

00:39:25,183 --> 00:39:27,152
(crickets chirping)

00:39:33,661 --> 00:39:35,661
Who the hell are you?

00:39:46,666 --> 00:39:48,240
The time you spent

00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,661
burning that lady's last
chance to find her daughter,

00:39:51,661 --> 00:39:54,661
you should have spent
burning your shirt.

00:39:54,661 --> 00:39:56,665
We found it
in your crawl space

00:39:56,665 --> 00:39:59,484
with Phil Kohler's
blood on it.

00:40:00,552 --> 00:40:02,554
<i>That puts the gun in your hand.</i>

00:40:23,508 --> 00:40:26,344
I bet you're wondering how
a guy with so many maps

00:40:26,344 --> 00:40:30,215
in front of him can
be so damn lost.

00:40:30,215 --> 00:40:33,661
Well, I think I can
help you find your way.

00:40:33,661 --> 00:40:36,421
Hodges analyzed the shovel
you found at the primary.

00:40:36,421 --> 00:40:38,056
<i>Found something interesting</i>

00:40:38,056 --> 00:40:40,667
<i>lodged between the blade</i>
<i>and the handle--</i>

00:40:40,667 --> 00:40:43,667
<i>a clump of Bermuda grass seed,</i>
<i>with trace of fertilizer,</i>

00:40:43,667 --> 00:40:46,064
a tackifier and green dye.

00:40:46,064 --> 00:40:49,467
Now, that particular formula
was unique to only one

00:40:49,467 --> 00:40:52,237
hydro-seeding company that was
operating five years ago.

00:40:52,237 --> 00:40:55,040
So I went and got a list
of all the projects

00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,541
they were working on

00:40:56,541 --> 00:40:58,661
around the time
of Rachel Beck's disappearance.

00:40:58,661 --> 00:41:03,281
One of those locations
was the intersection

00:41:03,281 --> 00:41:06,184
of Briarwood Road
and Lowell Road.
