00:00:09,456 --> 00:00:12,190
Second 430-B
out here this month.

00:00:12,256 --> 00:00:14,056
Lady can't give up
her cats, man.

00:00:14,123 --> 00:00:16,056
(scoffs)
Even when they're dead?

00:00:18,523 --> 00:00:19,656
Oof!

00:00:19,723 --> 00:00:21,890
That doesn't
smell like cat.

00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,456
Las Vegas police!

00:00:25,523 --> 00:00:27,423
Control, 1-George-12,

00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:30,923
possible 4-19, requesting
backup and CSI to our location.

00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:32,356
Your turn.

00:00:32,423 --> 00:00:33,590
DISPATCH:
Copy that. We'll notify CSI

00:00:33,656 --> 00:00:34,923
and a unit to back up 2-4.

00:00:38,123 --> 00:00:39,123
What, you getting soft, man?

00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:53,356
I don't think we're
getting in this way.

00:00:53,423 --> 00:00:55,790
Mitch and Akers said
there's a way in around back.

00:00:55,856 --> 00:00:58,223
They didn't go in, did they?

00:00:58,290 --> 00:00:59,723
Eyeballs only.

00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,396
They said they didn't want to
disturb a potential crime scene.

00:01:02,463 --> 00:01:06,230
The victim is probably the
homeowner, Marta Santiago.

00:01:06,296 --> 00:01:07,596
She live alone?

00:01:07,663 --> 00:01:08,930
As far as we know.

00:01:08,996 --> 00:01:12,063
The county declared this
place a risk to public safety.

00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:14,163
They ordered a
forced clean-out.

00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:16,596
Supposed to happen
by next Friday.

00:01:16,663 --> 00:01:17,930
Oh.

00:01:17,996 --> 00:01:20,396
Ah, how bad can it be?

00:01:24,396 --> 00:01:26,330
(flies buzzing)

00:01:27,496 --> 00:01:30,196
Hey, watch your, uh...

00:01:30,263 --> 00:01:31,396
Yeah.

00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:34,263
Whew.

00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:37,096
(cats yowling in distance)

00:01:37,163 --> 00:01:40,396
So how do you
want to do this?

00:01:40,463 --> 00:01:43,130
Well, I'd say "hug the walls,"
if I could see them.

00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:47,563
Goat trails seem to
be our only option.

00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,063
Unless you're
into Dumpster diving.

00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:52,096
Mm-hmm.

00:01:52,163 --> 00:01:54,296
Okay, I'll take the high road,
you take the low road?

00:01:54,363 --> 00:01:56,130
Document as we go?Yeah.

00:01:56,196 --> 00:01:57,730
Great.

00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:06,603
(rat squeaks)

00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:15,503
Ugh.

00:02:17,336 --> 00:02:18,270
(cat meows)

00:02:21,536 --> 00:02:22,470
(squeaking)

00:02:26,503 --> 00:02:28,436
(coughing)

00:02:32,403 --> 00:02:33,936
(cat yowls, Nick yells)

00:02:34,003 --> 00:02:35,670
Are you okay?

00:02:35,736 --> 00:02:37,603
Yeah.

00:02:39,736 --> 00:02:41,403
How could someone
live like this?

00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:44,036
Well, it smells more like
somebody died like this.

00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:57,603
(squeaks)

00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,103
Son of a bitch!

00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:01,803
What was that?

00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:04,343
Think I just saw a rat
wearing a saddle.

00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:05,843
(squishy crunch)

00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,243
That doesn't
sound good.

00:03:09,676 --> 00:03:11,376
I think I just
became evidence.

00:03:14,676 --> 00:03:16,476
I think you just
found Mrs. Santiago.

00:03:19,676 --> 00:03:21,643
Nick.

00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,276
Smile.

Directly in it.
Look at that.

00:04:08,016 --> 00:04:10,083
That's nasty in there, man.

00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,583
Oh, I, uh, called
the coroner's office.

00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:14,083
Asked them to hold off
until we cleared a path.

00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,883
Well, good luck with that.

00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:16,883
Sara's inside.

00:04:18,616 --> 00:04:20,516
Hope you brought
another pair of shoes.

00:04:29,116 --> 00:04:32,283
(rapid popping)
What the...? Hello!

00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:34,483
SANDERS:
It's just me.

00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:36,683
Bubble wrap.

00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,183
Wouldn't want to throw that out.

00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,883
Where <i>are--you?</i>

00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,616
Hang a right at
the sewing machine,

00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:44,550
and a left
at the Mason jars.

00:04:44,616 --> 00:04:46,250
Which sewing machine?

00:04:46,316 --> 00:04:48,583
Uh, just follow the North Star.

00:04:55,616 --> 00:04:57,850
David is going to
have fun with this.

00:04:57,916 --> 00:05:00,616
Looks like she melted
right into the rug.

00:05:00,683 --> 00:05:02,890
Oh, so that's what that is.

00:05:02,956 --> 00:05:04,456
WOMAN:
What are you doing in my house?

00:05:07,456 --> 00:05:10,956
I have the paper
you gave me.

00:05:11,023 --> 00:05:13,423
Mrs. Santiago?
Is that you?

00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:16,590
WOMAN:
Don't make me call the police.

00:05:16,656 --> 00:05:19,990
Ma'am, we are the police.

00:05:20,056 --> 00:05:21,123
WOMAN:
Dr. Prescott...

00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,823
you promised I'd have
until next week.

00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,623
Ma'am, I'm not
Dr. Prescott.

00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:26,723
My name is Sara Sidle.

00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:27,790
I'm with the crime lab.

00:05:27,856 --> 00:05:30,290
You have
a decomposing body here.

00:05:30,356 --> 00:05:31,490
Would you mind
stepping out?

00:05:31,556 --> 00:05:32,823
We'd like to ask
you a few questions.

00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:35,690
WOMAN:
Okay. I'm coming.

00:05:38,556 --> 00:05:40,956
SIDLE:
Hold on. Uh...

00:05:41,023 --> 00:05:44,623
Why don't you stay there?
I'm going to come to you.

00:05:59,223 --> 00:06:01,990
Oh, you're not going to take
a picture of me, are you?

00:06:02,056 --> 00:06:04,330
Ma'am, is there anyone else
in the house with you?

00:06:05,296 --> 00:06:06,796
My whole life is
in this house.

00:06:06,863 --> 00:06:08,730
I mean, is there
anyone else

00:06:08,796 --> 00:06:11,163
living in the house
with you right now.

00:06:17,163 --> 00:06:18,563
Ghosts.

00:06:21,096 --> 00:06:25,663
Uh, Mrs. Santiago, I need you
to take a look at something.

00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:28,196
If I do, will you leave?

00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:29,830
I can't promise you that.

00:06:29,896 --> 00:06:32,196
Please, come with me.

00:06:32,263 --> 00:06:34,463
It's important.

00:06:48,396 --> 00:06:50,830
(gasps)
That's Diana's dress!

00:06:50,896 --> 00:06:52,130
That's my daughter!

00:06:52,196 --> 00:06:54,296
That's my baby! Diana!SIDLE:
Okay, look,

00:06:54,363 --> 00:06:56,296
We're going to take very
good care of her, okay?

00:06:56,363 --> 00:06:57,296
I promise.
Don't touch that!

00:06:57,363 --> 00:06:58,463
What?

00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:01,503
Put it down! You need
to stop that, right now!

00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:02,736
Maybe you should put that down.

00:07:02,803 --> 00:07:04,470
You need to stop! Right now!
Put it down, Nick.

00:07:04,536 --> 00:07:06,403
Ma'am, why don't we
step outside, okay?

00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:07,436
We're gonna...

00:07:07,503 --> 00:07:09,336
We're gonna...
just gonna go outside.

00:07:09,403 --> 00:07:12,036
SIDLE: If you'd just come
with me, all right?

00:07:12,103 --> 00:07:13,670
So sorry.

00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:18,636
Hey.

00:07:18,703 --> 00:07:20,270
You didn't clear
a path for the body.

00:07:20,336 --> 00:07:21,270
You kidding me?

00:07:21,336 --> 00:07:22,836
You're Super Dave.

00:07:26,536 --> 00:07:28,703
(flies buzzing)

00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:34,903
Disgusting.

00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:45,103
You ready?
Yeah.

00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:47,103
(body squishing)

00:07:53,436 --> 00:07:54,703
Come on. Come on.

00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,703
Yeah, you got it?

00:07:59,936 --> 00:08:04,110
I appreciate Nick doing
the Y-incision for me.

00:08:04,176 --> 00:08:07,010
Though I generally
prefer a scalpel to a boot.

00:08:09,176 --> 00:08:12,176
Victim appears to be
in her early 20s.

00:08:12,243 --> 00:08:14,776
How long do you think she
was lying dead in the house?

00:08:14,843 --> 00:08:18,543
Post-mortem interval is anywhere
from five to seven days.

00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:20,943
So her mother didn't
notice for a week.

00:08:22,843 --> 00:08:24,343
So what do you got
for cause of death?

00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:27,810
Epidural hematoma.

00:08:27,876 --> 00:08:29,743
That means she
didn't die instantly.

00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:30,976
Accidental or deliberate,
I can't say,

00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:33,676
but I do know that it was
a single blow to the head.

00:08:33,743 --> 00:08:37,810
LANGSTON: The wound impression
looks like a giant bar code.

00:08:37,876 --> 00:08:41,343
Have you ever seen
anything like that before?

00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:44,776
No, it's one weapon which has
thus far escaped my attention.

00:08:44,843 --> 00:08:47,576
Whatever it was,
if it was in the house...

00:08:47,643 --> 00:08:50,243
she probably
didn't throw it out.

00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:04,716
So, Diana wasn't
Mrs. Santiago's only child.

00:09:04,783 --> 00:09:06,983
The case file mentioned
another daughter and a son.

00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:08,116
Both grown.

00:09:08,183 --> 00:09:10,150
Brass is trying
to track them down.

00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,816
Good luck finding anything in
here, let alone a murder weapon.

00:09:12,883 --> 00:09:14,616
I'm not so sure we're
dealing with a murder here.

00:09:14,683 --> 00:09:16,450
Sara, look at this place.

00:09:16,516 --> 00:09:18,150
Whether the mother hit
the daughter with something,

00:09:18,216 --> 00:09:20,683
or it fell off one of
these big piles of crap,

00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:24,250
this house killed her.

00:09:28,716 --> 00:09:30,316
I've got blood drops.

00:09:30,383 --> 00:09:31,483
What?

00:09:34,183 --> 00:09:35,616
Right here.

00:09:46,716 --> 00:09:48,783
SIDLE:
I lost the trail.

00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:59,150
SIDLE:
That's a lot of blood.

00:09:59,216 --> 00:10:00,250
STOKES:
Sure is.

00:10:00,316 --> 00:10:02,556
You think Doc Robbins
was right about that

00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,856
single--blow to the head?

00:10:03,923 --> 00:10:05,723
It's a generalized reaction.

00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:08,456
STOKES:
Of course it is, 'cause the
luminol's reacting to all the

00:10:08,523 --> 00:10:11,623
cat urine, feces, and God knows
what else in this place.

00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:13,856
We could use
hydrogen peroxide.

00:10:13,923 --> 00:10:14,856
Got some on you?

00:10:14,923 --> 00:10:16,123
I do.

00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:19,190
It'll foam up when it makes
contact with the blood.

00:10:19,256 --> 00:10:20,390
Yeah. Nice.

00:10:47,256 --> 00:10:48,556
(sighs)

00:10:48,623 --> 00:10:51,056
Somebody tried to
tidy up in here.

00:10:51,123 --> 00:10:53,023
Maybe Diana.

00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:55,723
That could explain how she
ended up melted into the rug.

00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:58,223
You know, the court
ordered Mrs. Santiago
to clean this place up.

00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:59,623
Diana came over to help...

00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:02,130
Diana! No!
No! No,no, no...!

00:11:02,196 --> 00:11:03,630
We've got to clear this out.

00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:04,696
No, no! No!

00:11:04,763 --> 00:11:05,996
Please!

00:11:06,063 --> 00:11:07,230
No!

00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:09,663
I told you to stop!

00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:11,830
Mm, getting a little ahead
of the evidence, Nick.

00:11:11,896 --> 00:11:12,963
You think?

00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:14,530
MAN (in distance):
What are you doing here?

00:11:14,596 --> 00:11:15,930
You have...
you have authorization for this?

00:11:15,996 --> 00:11:18,796
MAN 2: Calm down...
I'll check that out.

00:11:18,863 --> 00:11:20,796
You can't be here.
This is my mother's house.

00:11:20,863 --> 00:11:23,196
Sir, I understand, but
you need to step back.

00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:26,196
SIDLE: Excuse me.
Uh, you're Mrs. Santiago's son?

00:11:26,263 --> 00:11:29,230
I'm Julian Santiago.

00:11:29,296 --> 00:11:30,363
She's my mother.

00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:32,796
What's going on here?

00:11:32,863 --> 00:11:34,396
We're investigating
a homicide.

00:11:34,463 --> 00:11:36,963
My mother's dead?

00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,830
We believe it's
your sister Diana.

00:11:40,896 --> 00:11:43,330
(gasps)

00:11:43,396 --> 00:11:44,463
(moans)

00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:47,196
I'm very sorry for your loss.

00:11:47,263 --> 00:11:49,596
Wh-what happened?

00:11:49,663 --> 00:11:52,896
Well, that's what we're
trying to sort out.

00:11:52,963 --> 00:11:54,963
When was the last time
that you spoke with Diana?

00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:57,796
She called me
about a week ago.

00:11:57,863 --> 00:11:59,563
Said Mom got a letter
from Dr. Prescott

00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:02,470
about the forced
clean-out.

00:12:02,536 --> 00:12:04,470
She asked if I could help.

00:12:05,536 --> 00:12:07,036
I told her I'd call her back.

00:12:07,103 --> 00:12:09,703
Did you?

00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,103
No.

00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:15,070
You also have, um, another
sister, isn't that right?

00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:18,536
Alisa.

00:12:18,603 --> 00:12:20,836
Hav-have-haven't spoken
to her in a while.

00:12:20,903 --> 00:12:22,436
Why is that?

00:12:22,503 --> 00:12:24,770
She's not the easiest
person to deal with.

00:12:24,836 --> 00:12:28,603
I mean, you've seen
the inside of this house.

00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:31,470
Alisa had the hardest
time with it, growing up.

00:12:31,536 --> 00:12:35,036
Well, we're going to need a
number where we can reach her.

00:12:35,103 --> 00:12:37,003
Uh, yeah.

00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:45,403
LANGSTON: What happened
in that house, Dr. Prescott?

00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:48,403
Do you believe that
Mrs. Santiago is capable

00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:49,503
of hurting her daughter?

00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:52,836
Based on my observation, no.

00:12:52,903 --> 00:12:54,436
She's a hoarder, not a killer.

00:12:54,503 --> 00:12:56,103
I've been assigned to
Mrs. Santiago's case

00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:58,703
for the past two years.

00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:01,876
She's well-groomed, she has
a job, works as a librarian,

00:13:01,943 --> 00:13:03,910
supports herself;
she's quite high-functioning.

00:13:03,976 --> 00:13:05,676
Except inside that house.

00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:08,510
We can't fully explain
the phenomenon of hoarding.

00:13:08,576 --> 00:13:11,310
It crosses over into several
categories of mental illness:

00:13:11,376 --> 00:13:14,443
OCD, impulse control,
dissociative behavior.

00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:15,943
And, in her case?

00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:18,243
Based on my interviews
with her and her children,

00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:21,243
the nature of her hoarding
goes beyond the inability

00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:22,510
to throw things away.

00:13:22,576 --> 00:13:26,310
For her, it's about...
safeguarding memories.

00:13:26,376 --> 00:13:27,976
Keeping things that are
important to her,

00:13:28,043 --> 00:13:30,310
and her family, close to her.

00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:32,276
Family is everything.

00:13:32,343 --> 00:13:33,610
Well, if that
were the case,

00:13:33,676 --> 00:13:35,276
then how could she just
leave her daughter's dead body

00:13:35,343 --> 00:13:36,510
lying in the
house for a week?

00:13:36,576 --> 00:13:39,210
Well, every hoarder
experiences

00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:41,176
something called
"clutter blindness."

00:13:41,243 --> 00:13:43,243
For a level-one hoarder,
it can mean ignoring

00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:45,376
a stack of newspapers
piling up in a room.

00:13:45,443 --> 00:13:47,843
What level is Mrs. Santiago?

00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:50,876
Level Five.

00:13:50,943 --> 00:13:52,410
The most extreme.

00:13:52,476 --> 00:13:53,843
LANGSTON:
So you're telling me that this

00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:57,176
"clutter blindness" would
allow her to live in the house

00:13:57,243 --> 00:13:59,910
with her daughter's
dead body... indefinitely?

00:14:01,316 --> 00:14:04,083
Unfortunately, yes.

00:14:12,149 --> 00:14:13,916
When can I go home?
Soon. Soon.

00:14:13,983 --> 00:14:17,883
We just need to understand
what happened to Diana.

00:14:17,949 --> 00:14:19,549
Let's go back
to last week.

00:14:19,616 --> 00:14:22,383
I saw the two of you
together at the house.

00:14:25,716 --> 00:14:27,549
My memory's pretty bad.

00:14:30,616 --> 00:14:33,016
Are you going to
throw that away?

00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:34,983
It's out of ink, Marta.

00:14:35,049 --> 00:14:38,883
That's the pen you handed
Diana, to write down

00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,983
all her information.

00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:42,816
Name, address, phone.

00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:44,616
When you came by
to hand me the letter,

00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:45,950
the letter that
said I had until

00:14:46,016 --> 00:14:49,783
5:00 p.m. on November 5th
to clean up.

00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:52,416
Your memory's not
as bad as you think.

00:14:52,483 --> 00:14:54,883
Is it?

00:14:58,516 --> 00:15:01,090
LANGSTON: What can you tell me
about this clock?

00:15:01,156 --> 00:15:03,856
It's a family heirloom.

00:15:03,923 --> 00:15:07,490
My husband's grandfather
brought it back from Spain.

00:15:07,556 --> 00:15:10,590
Before World War II.

00:15:10,656 --> 00:15:12,456
And whose blood
is that on it?

00:15:13,923 --> 00:15:15,256
It's Diana's.

00:15:15,323 --> 00:15:17,923
SIDLE:
Blood trail ends here.

00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:19,856
This must be where
she was hit.

00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:24,123
How did the blood
get on the rug?

00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:27,223
It was an accident.

00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:31,123
We found our bar code.

00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:40,623
Do you know what this is?

00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:44,323
Diana was throwing things away.

00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:46,123
She said she found something.

00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:47,856
What did she find?

00:15:47,923 --> 00:15:49,156
SANTIAGO:
I didn't want to look,

00:15:49,223 --> 00:15:51,223
I just wanted her
to stop what she was doing!

00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:54,190
And then everything
was falling; she was bleeding.

00:15:54,256 --> 00:15:56,723
She said she was okay.

00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,190
She left.

00:15:59,256 --> 00:16:00,990
Didn't come back.

00:16:01,056 --> 00:16:03,463
Can you tell us what
it was that she found?

00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:12,096
May I please go home?

00:16:15,196 --> 00:16:16,130
(gunshot)

00:16:18,063 --> 00:16:19,430
SIDLE:
Are you okay?
STOKES:
Yeah.

00:16:19,496 --> 00:16:21,430
SANDERS: Don't touch it
until I can clear it.

00:16:21,496 --> 00:16:23,163
Geez, Louise.

00:16:24,696 --> 00:16:27,596
(laughing)

00:16:27,663 --> 00:16:29,930
Hey, guys?

00:16:29,996 --> 00:16:31,230
Over here.

00:16:38,863 --> 00:16:40,396
Whoa.

00:16:40,463 --> 00:16:42,263
Looks like you stepped
in it this time.

00:16:54,995 --> 00:16:57,162
Ooh!

00:16:57,228 --> 00:16:58,828
Scorpion and her babies.

00:16:58,895 --> 00:17:00,695
SIDLE: You're kidding me.
STOKES:
And a big one.

00:17:00,762 --> 00:17:03,268
SANDERS:
They usually move in well after
all the meat's off the bones.

00:17:06,302 --> 00:17:09,802
Okay, sloping forehead,
narrow pelvis,

00:17:09,868 --> 00:17:11,268
inlet's nearly heart-shaped.

00:17:11,335 --> 00:17:12,702
Definitely male.

00:17:12,768 --> 00:17:14,935
What do you make of the ribbon?

00:17:15,002 --> 00:17:16,602
SIDLE:
It's not your typical ligature.

00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:18,202
Look how he's tied up.

00:17:18,268 --> 00:17:19,735
Wrists tied in front.

00:17:19,802 --> 00:17:21,168
So it wasn't about
restraining him.

00:17:22,468 --> 00:17:24,302
Think we found Mr. Santiago?

00:17:24,368 --> 00:17:25,535
Case file did mention something

00:17:25,602 --> 00:17:27,935
about him passing
away 10 years ago.

00:17:28,002 --> 00:17:31,802
Maybe she didn't
want to spring for the urn.

00:17:31,868 --> 00:17:35,002
I gotta tell you, man,
this place is disgusting.

00:17:36,368 --> 00:17:37,935
It's not the crime scene
that's bugging me.

00:17:38,002 --> 00:17:39,302
It's what created it.

00:17:39,368 --> 00:17:42,068
Well, look, Nick, you're
talking about a woman here,

00:17:42,135 --> 00:17:44,535
who has clearly been through
some kind of a major trauma.

00:17:44,602 --> 00:17:45,735
You can be traumatized

00:17:45,802 --> 00:17:46,968
and still take out
the damn trash.

00:17:47,035 --> 00:17:48,435
There's no excuse for this.

00:17:48,502 --> 00:17:51,102
You know, I'm starting to think
this whole hoarding thing's

00:17:51,168 --> 00:17:53,035
a pretty good
cover for a killer.

00:17:53,102 --> 00:17:54,668
That's your theory.
I don't think so.

00:17:56,102 --> 00:17:58,468
You know, someone

00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:01,002
needs to go
process Mrs. Santiago,

00:18:01,068 --> 00:18:03,508
so... I guess I'll go do that.

00:18:05,842 --> 00:18:07,775
And you guys can
finish up this room.

00:18:09,008 --> 00:18:09,975
What's her deal?

00:18:10,042 --> 00:18:11,442
(sighs)

00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:13,575
Well, I got a feeling
this is not the last body

00:18:13,642 --> 00:18:14,742
we're gonna find
in this house.

00:18:17,575 --> 00:18:18,942
ROBBINS:
Well, unless she married young,

00:18:19,008 --> 00:18:20,575
I don't think you're
looking at Mr. Santiago.

00:18:20,642 --> 00:18:25,142
Indications are male Caucasian,
five feet, seven inches tall.

00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:28,242
Uh, age between
15 and 17 years.

00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:32,808
LANGSTON: No apparent injuries
to the bones.

00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:37,275
No beveling,
no tool marks,

00:18:37,342 --> 00:18:38,308
No fractures.

00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:39,642
All right. Adolescent male.

00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:40,808
That narrows the possibilities.

00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:43,208
Could be... an overdose.

00:18:43,275 --> 00:18:45,975
Only way to determine
that is bone marrow.

00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:48,375
And I know you
must miss the days of

00:18:48,442 --> 00:18:51,208
research pathology--
care for a slice?

00:18:51,275 --> 00:18:53,942
Don't mind if I do.

00:19:08,615 --> 00:19:10,915
(saw whirring)

00:19:24,982 --> 00:19:25,915
Thank you.

00:19:28,148 --> 00:19:29,748
Mrs. Santiago.

00:19:29,815 --> 00:19:31,448
I'm going to need
to take your clothes,

00:19:31,515 --> 00:19:33,082
and the rest of your
personal possessions.

00:19:33,148 --> 00:19:34,248
Why?

00:19:34,315 --> 00:19:35,415
What's happening?

00:19:35,482 --> 00:19:36,748
You're being booked.

00:19:36,815 --> 00:19:38,682
We found another
body in your house.

00:19:39,648 --> 00:19:41,482
Where?

00:19:41,548 --> 00:19:43,748
I'm sorry. I'm going to need
to get your clothes, now.

00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:46,648
No. I want to go home!

00:19:46,715 --> 00:19:50,348
I understand,
Mrs. Santiago; I do.

00:19:50,415 --> 00:19:53,915
Um... you know...
I really need you

00:19:53,982 --> 00:19:56,415
to do something
for me right now.

00:19:56,482 --> 00:19:58,715
Do you think
you could do that?

00:19:58,782 --> 00:20:00,682
Could you give me your hand?

00:20:03,555 --> 00:20:06,222
It's going to
be really easy.

00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,222
We're just going
to step over here.

00:20:08,288 --> 00:20:10,622
Just put your hand over
the envelope, like this.

00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:15,922
There you go.

00:20:15,988 --> 00:20:17,588
All right?

00:20:17,655 --> 00:20:20,522
ANDREWS:
Bone marrow cells exhibited
some curious anomalies,

00:20:20,588 --> 00:20:22,888
which you might find with
dyserythropoietic anemia,

00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:24,888
or thrombocytopenia.

00:20:24,955 --> 00:20:26,688
Henry, did you run
a heavy metals test?

00:20:26,755 --> 00:20:27,688
Yeah.

00:20:27,755 --> 00:20:30,022
And I got you John Doe's C.O.D.

00:20:31,122 --> 00:20:33,922
"Acute arsenic poisoning."

00:20:33,988 --> 00:20:35,022
Levels were off the charts.

00:20:35,088 --> 00:20:36,488
No way this was
poisoning over time.

00:20:36,555 --> 00:20:40,555
Victim was given
one massive dose of arsenic.

00:20:57,588 --> 00:20:59,855
So... what's up
with you and Nick?

00:20:59,922 --> 00:21:02,928
I just don't think
he gets it, you know?

00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:07,528
What happened in this house,
something caused it to happen.

00:21:07,595 --> 00:21:09,328
Something triggered it.

00:21:09,395 --> 00:21:10,928
Death of her husband, perhaps?

00:21:10,995 --> 00:21:13,628
A woman alone, with kids...

00:21:13,695 --> 00:21:17,162
Couldn't let go of the
things that she had left?

00:21:17,228 --> 00:21:19,495
Yeah.
It spiraled out of control.

00:21:25,728 --> 00:21:28,295
Dr. Prescott,
this is Nick Stokes.

00:21:28,362 --> 00:21:32,062
Nick, Dr. Prescott
is Mrs. Santiago's case worker.

00:21:32,128 --> 00:21:33,362
Oh. Nice to meet you, Doctor.

00:21:33,428 --> 00:21:35,095
Hey.

00:21:35,162 --> 00:21:36,595
So, now we're
talking about murder.

00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:38,428
This woman's killing people and
packing them away in her house.

00:21:38,495 --> 00:21:40,462
Okay, look,
I can't explain the presence

00:21:40,528 --> 00:21:42,495
of the John Doe or
the arsenic,

00:21:42,562 --> 00:21:45,228
but Marta is
incapable of violence.

00:21:45,295 --> 00:21:46,428
Ooh, I don't know about that.

00:21:46,495 --> 00:21:47,695
You ever touch anything of hers?

00:21:47,762 --> 00:21:50,962
Dr. Prescott,
for argument's sake,

00:21:51,028 --> 00:21:52,495
if there are
more bodies here,

00:21:52,562 --> 00:21:53,895
is there some method

00:21:53,962 --> 00:21:55,762
by which Mrs. Santiago
might be hiding them?

00:21:55,828 --> 00:21:57,528
I don't think you're going
to find any more bodies.

00:21:57,595 --> 00:21:59,328
LANGSTON:
I'm sure you don't.However,

00:21:59,395 --> 00:22:01,762
if you're asking
if a hoarder like Marta

00:22:01,828 --> 00:22:04,702
has some sort of system,
then that answer is yes.

00:22:04,768 --> 00:22:07,335
Most of us live our
lives categorically.

00:22:07,402 --> 00:22:09,002
Pots and pans
go in the kitchen,

00:22:09,068 --> 00:22:11,502
tools go in the toolbox,
underwear goes in the drawer,

00:22:11,568 --> 00:22:16,202
but Marta organizes her world
visually and spatially

00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:17,502
by stacking.

00:22:17,568 --> 00:22:19,968
What does this have to do
with our crime scene?

00:22:20,035 --> 00:22:22,835
We're trying to learn how to
read these rooms, Nick.

00:22:22,902 --> 00:22:24,168
I don't get it.

00:22:24,235 --> 00:22:26,702
So we're trash whispering now?

00:22:26,768 --> 00:22:28,168
Yes, and if we listen carefully,

00:22:28,235 --> 00:22:30,368
we might be able to find
what we're looking for.

00:22:30,435 --> 00:22:32,802
I haven't been in this part
of the house in a few months,

00:22:32,868 --> 00:22:34,135
but these storage bins
weren't here before.

00:22:37,635 --> 00:22:40,368
Looks like these items were
pushed in from the hallway.

00:22:40,435 --> 00:22:42,402
All right, what
would that tell us?

00:22:42,468 --> 00:22:43,635
I don't know.

00:22:43,702 --> 00:22:44,768
Marta was shifting
her possessions

00:22:44,835 --> 00:22:46,668
from one side of the house
to the other.

00:22:57,168 --> 00:22:59,902
Why would she do that?

00:22:59,968 --> 00:23:02,642
Because the city told her
to clean this place up.

00:23:05,975 --> 00:23:07,742
These look like time capsules.

00:23:07,808 --> 00:23:09,708
What's that?

00:23:09,775 --> 00:23:11,375
A time capsule's
an impulsive act

00:23:11,442 --> 00:23:13,242
by a hoarder to throw away
groups of items

00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:15,208
into a single container
at a single moment in time.

00:23:15,275 --> 00:23:18,075
However, the intention is
to deal with these items later.

00:23:24,408 --> 00:23:26,108
All of those items
belong to Alisa.

00:23:26,175 --> 00:23:28,208
Alisa.

00:23:34,542 --> 00:23:36,242
Is this her room?

00:23:43,342 --> 00:23:44,875
Doctor, why is

00:23:44,942 --> 00:23:46,375
this room clean?

00:23:46,442 --> 00:23:49,675
I don't know what would trigger
something like this.

00:23:49,742 --> 00:23:52,508
STOKES:
I do.

00:23:52,575 --> 00:23:54,242
And I bet
we're gonna find her body

00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:55,342
somewhere in this house.

00:23:55,408 --> 00:23:56,442
(knocking)

00:23:56,508 --> 00:23:58,542
You guys need to see this.

00:24:07,915 --> 00:24:10,548
Hands in front,
bound with red ribbon.

00:24:12,015 --> 00:24:14,448
Is Alisa one of them?

00:24:14,515 --> 00:24:20,782
Well, from the looks of it,
I'd say three more boys.

00:24:20,848 --> 00:24:22,682
STOKES:
Whatever comes
in this house,

00:24:22,748 --> 00:24:25,748
doesn't seem
to make it back out.

00:24:33,348 --> 00:24:35,748
SIDLE: Our first John Doe is
16-year-old Matthew Price.

00:24:35,815 --> 00:24:37,115
His DNA got a hit

00:24:37,182 --> 00:24:39,615
off the U.S. Directory
of Missing Persons.

00:24:39,682 --> 00:24:42,915
So did two of the three
of our backyard John Does.

00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:45,215
Ryan Hoff, age 17

00:24:45,282 --> 00:24:47,015
and Derrick Kennedy,also 16.

00:24:47,082 --> 00:24:49,048
Henry confirmed C.O.D.
on all four boys

00:24:49,115 --> 00:24:50,615
was acute arsenic poisoning.

00:24:50,682 --> 00:24:54,282
SIDLE: Well, these three
were all I.D.'d as runaways

00:24:54,348 --> 00:24:56,448
and referred to the Avenues
of Care Halfway House

00:24:56,515 --> 00:24:59,348
by the county as part
of their plea agreements.

00:25:00,682 --> 00:25:03,755
Guess who the director
of the halfway house is.

00:25:05,788 --> 00:25:07,588
LANGSTON:
Julian Santiago.

00:25:07,655 --> 00:25:10,222
The son is the one
dumping the bodies.

00:25:10,288 --> 00:25:12,288
Maybe Mrs. Santiago isn't
the only one in the family

00:25:12,355 --> 00:25:13,588
who can't let go.

00:25:13,655 --> 00:25:15,922
BRASS:
You've been busy.

00:25:18,122 --> 00:25:20,222
We've been busy, too.

00:25:20,288 --> 00:25:21,722
We know all about

00:25:21,788 --> 00:25:23,622
your job at the halfway house.

00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:27,988
Avenues of Care--
"A refuge for troubled teens."

00:25:29,888 --> 00:25:31,122
I guess they didn't know

00:25:31,188 --> 00:25:32,955
how much trouble
they were really in.

00:25:33,022 --> 00:25:34,955
SIDLE:
Matthew Price--

00:25:35,022 --> 00:25:36,922
when he was alive,
we talked to his father.

00:25:36,988 --> 00:25:38,822
He said that six months ago
he drove up from Mesquite

00:25:38,888 --> 00:25:40,388
to pick his son up
at the halfway house.

00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:42,555
But when he got there,

00:25:42,622 --> 00:25:44,088
you said that his son ran away.

00:25:44,155 --> 00:25:46,222
Well, it's unfortunate
for these types of kids,

00:25:46,288 --> 00:25:47,455
but it does happen.

00:25:47,522 --> 00:25:48,455
Sure it does.

00:25:48,522 --> 00:25:50,255
SIDLE:
Matthew's father said

00:25:50,322 --> 00:25:51,888
his son talked a lot
about a girl.

00:25:51,955 --> 00:25:54,522
Her name was Alisa Santiago.

00:25:54,588 --> 00:25:56,022
BRASS: They met when
she volunteered

00:25:56,088 --> 00:25:57,055
at your halfway house.

00:25:57,122 --> 00:25:58,955
I told you
my sister had problems.

00:25:59,022 --> 00:26:00,588
So I tried to help
her the way

00:26:00,655 --> 00:26:02,328
I helped myself--
by helping others.

00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,762
So yes, I got her a job
at the halfway house.

00:26:05,828 --> 00:26:07,762
Right. Where she met Matthew

00:26:07,828 --> 00:26:13,295
and Ryan and Derrick.

00:26:13,362 --> 00:26:15,028
Love.

00:26:15,095 --> 00:26:17,262
It's a beautiful thing.

00:26:17,328 --> 00:26:19,428
SIDLE: Except when
it turns to obsession,

00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:22,128
control, violence.

00:26:22,195 --> 00:26:25,328
We talked to your coworkers
at the halfway house.

00:26:25,395 --> 00:26:26,762
They said Alisa was
a very popular girl

00:26:26,828 --> 00:26:27,928
and you didn't like that.

00:26:27,995 --> 00:26:30,562
Must be hard for
an older brother

00:26:30,628 --> 00:26:33,362
to watch his younger sister
mess with all those boys.

00:26:33,428 --> 00:26:37,262
We all thought
that your mother did this.

00:26:37,328 --> 00:26:38,595
Look, whatever freaky
fantasies you have

00:26:38,662 --> 00:26:40,562
about these young boys
and your sister--

00:26:40,628 --> 00:26:42,495
I don't care.

00:26:42,562 --> 00:26:44,428
What I care about is why
you used a sick woman

00:26:44,495 --> 00:26:46,428
to bury your crimes.
This is completely insane.

00:26:46,495 --> 00:26:49,095
That cell phone number
that you gave me for Alisa--

00:26:49,162 --> 00:26:51,162
service was disconnected
four months ago.

00:26:51,228 --> 00:26:54,028
She's six months
behind on her rent.

00:26:54,095 --> 00:26:56,262
Where is she?

00:26:56,328 --> 00:26:59,028
I want a lawyer.

00:27:05,268 --> 00:27:07,902
(sighs)

00:27:07,968 --> 00:27:10,568
No blood, no fluids, nothing.

00:27:10,635 --> 00:27:12,035
If Alisa was killed
in this room,

00:27:12,102 --> 00:27:13,868
there'd be evidence of it.

00:27:13,935 --> 00:27:17,602
Well, these swabs are negative.

00:27:17,668 --> 00:27:20,335
Well, Mrs. Santiago cleaned
this room for a reason.

00:27:20,402 --> 00:27:22,868
According to Dr. Prescott,

00:27:22,935 --> 00:27:26,202
she took all
of Alisa's belongings,

00:27:26,268 --> 00:27:28,868
put them outside here

00:27:28,935 --> 00:27:32,068
in the hallway in
these time capsules.

00:27:32,135 --> 00:27:33,435
She said it was triggered
by an event.

00:27:33,502 --> 00:27:35,335
When it comes to
this lady, pick one.

00:27:39,602 --> 00:27:42,135
Family was the most important
thing to Mrs. Santiago.

00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:43,502
Which is why,

00:27:43,568 --> 00:27:46,035
if Julian killed his sister,
she'd want to protect him.

00:27:46,102 --> 00:27:48,735
And the best way to protect him
is to hide the evidence.

00:27:48,802 --> 00:27:50,435
It's a two-fer.

00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:53,835
Mom gets to keep both children
closer to her bosom.

00:27:53,902 --> 00:27:55,502
So...

00:28:01,368 --> 00:28:03,675
Mementos of Alisa's
graduation from college.

00:28:12,908 --> 00:28:14,175
A prom dress.

00:28:17,608 --> 00:28:19,975
What is that?

00:28:20,042 --> 00:28:22,742
A quinceañera dress.

00:28:22,808 --> 00:28:25,608
This is like we're
going back in time.

00:28:25,675 --> 00:28:27,742
It's a regression.

00:28:27,808 --> 00:28:30,742
Like she's putting her
back into the womb.

00:28:43,108 --> 00:28:45,475
(door creaking)

00:29:05,348 --> 00:29:07,282
Nick.

00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:12,182
(flies buzzing)

00:29:14,815 --> 00:29:16,248
(gasping)

00:29:20,582 --> 00:29:22,815
(sighs)

00:29:34,315 --> 00:29:36,448
Alisa?

00:29:36,515 --> 00:29:38,915
I'm Nick Stokes.

00:29:38,982 --> 00:29:41,082
My partner and I were
the ones that found you.

00:29:41,148 --> 00:29:42,648
You remember me?

00:29:42,715 --> 00:29:44,015
Hmm?

00:29:45,315 --> 00:29:48,582
You feel up to answering
a couple of questions?

00:29:48,648 --> 00:29:50,482
Where's my mom?

00:29:50,548 --> 00:29:52,782
She's in custody.

00:29:52,848 --> 00:29:54,548
Why?

00:29:54,615 --> 00:29:57,215
We'll get to her in a minute.

00:29:57,282 --> 00:30:00,515
Let's talk about
you first.

00:30:00,582 --> 00:30:01,955
(sighs)

00:30:04,022 --> 00:30:06,188
You want to tell me
who did this to you?

00:30:08,455 --> 00:30:09,788
It's okay.

00:30:09,855 --> 00:30:11,155
Nobody's going to mess with you.

00:30:11,222 --> 00:30:13,555
You don't know that.

00:30:15,255 --> 00:30:18,855
I can protect you,
but I need to know who did this.

00:30:23,688 --> 00:30:25,622
Are you afraid of your brother?

00:30:28,222 --> 00:30:31,322
Look, I know you're scared,
but you can speak up now.

00:30:31,388 --> 00:30:33,322
Is he the one
who did this to you?

00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:43,955
My mother did this to me.

00:30:46,055 --> 00:30:50,355
The garbage, the bodies--
that part I was handling okay.

00:30:50,422 --> 00:30:52,388
But this...

00:30:52,455 --> 00:30:54,388
this is some
kind of twisted.

00:30:57,222 --> 00:31:00,688
Is hoarding people
part of hoarding?

00:31:00,755 --> 00:31:01,928
My understanding of it is that

00:31:01,995 --> 00:31:03,495
hoarding is more
self-destructive.

00:31:03,562 --> 00:31:05,695
The damage inflicted
on others is more

00:31:05,762 --> 00:31:07,995
emotional than
it is physical.

00:31:08,062 --> 00:31:09,895
You don't think both daughters
were being held here, do you?

00:31:09,962 --> 00:31:12,295
Diana certainly seems to have
had more freedom of movement.

00:31:12,362 --> 00:31:13,462
Alisa and the boys...

00:31:15,262 --> 00:31:16,928
That's another story.

00:31:16,995 --> 00:31:18,295
So everything I heard is true.

00:31:20,162 --> 00:31:21,995
How long was Alisa held here?

00:31:22,062 --> 00:31:24,195
Well, the evidence indicates
that she was here for a while

00:31:24,262 --> 00:31:27,195
and that she was cared for
behind a wall of time capsules.

00:31:27,262 --> 00:31:28,862
If you
consider a mom

00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:31,128
chaining her daughter
to a bed "caring."

00:31:31,195 --> 00:31:34,428
Something doesn't add up.

00:32:03,768 --> 00:32:07,035
(whirring)

00:32:23,902 --> 00:32:26,068
SANDERS:
<i>So I was able to recover</i>

00:32:26,135 --> 00:32:27,602
the serial number
from the handcuffs

00:32:27,668 --> 00:32:29,168
used to
restrain Alisa.

00:32:29,235 --> 00:32:32,035
Tracked back to a batch order
belonging to a local gun shop.

00:32:32,102 --> 00:32:33,968
The owner faxed me the
credit card receipt.

00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,202
Nice work.

00:32:35,268 --> 00:32:38,935
Well, Greg just
I.D.'d our jailer:

00:32:39,002 --> 00:32:39,968
Julian Santiago.

00:32:40,035 --> 00:32:42,802
He purchased the handcuffs.

00:32:42,868 --> 00:32:44,168
So what?
He also has a carry permit.

00:32:44,235 --> 00:32:45,168
He works with
juvenile offenders.

00:32:46,568 --> 00:32:49,335
All the hard evidence
points to Mrs. Santiago.

00:32:49,402 --> 00:32:50,902
LANGSTON:
What Nick means is that

00:32:50,968 --> 00:32:53,535
there were two sets of
prints in the bedroom.

00:32:53,602 --> 00:32:55,535
There were Alisa's prints
and her mother's prints.

00:32:55,602 --> 00:32:57,168
STOKES: And the scrapings
that you collected

00:32:57,235 --> 00:32:59,568
under Mrs. Santiago's nails were
a match to the talcum powder

00:32:59,635 --> 00:33:02,842
and the skin lotion
next to the bed, so...

00:33:02,908 --> 00:33:05,975
So that puts Mrs. Santiago
in the bedroom, not Julian.

00:33:06,042 --> 00:33:11,608
Okay. But Julian
is still our connection

00:33:11,675 --> 00:33:13,408
to those dead boys in
the bedroom.

00:33:13,475 --> 00:33:16,142
Maybe Mrs. Santiago
was being dominated

00:33:16,208 --> 00:33:18,642
by her son; maybe she wasn't
acting out of free will.

00:33:18,708 --> 00:33:21,375
What is it about this woman
that has you so blind?

00:33:21,442 --> 00:33:23,142
What is it about this case

00:33:23,208 --> 00:33:25,208
that has you acting
like such an ass right now?

00:33:25,275 --> 00:33:26,675
Oh, I'm an ass now?

00:33:26,742 --> 00:33:30,908
There is a very real possibility
that Julian killed those boys

00:33:30,975 --> 00:33:32,975
to keep them away
from his sister,

00:33:33,042 --> 00:33:35,308
and he's using his mother and
her house to bury the evidence.

00:33:35,375 --> 00:33:36,475
You're absolutely right.

00:33:36,542 --> 00:33:37,908
There is that possibility.

00:33:37,975 --> 00:33:40,075
So why don't we

00:33:40,142 --> 00:33:42,008
stick to the evidence
that we have?

00:33:42,075 --> 00:33:44,475
Can we try that?

00:33:44,542 --> 00:33:45,842
Okay.

00:33:45,908 --> 00:33:47,208
Fine.

00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:50,175
So, the evidence
that we have suggests

00:33:50,242 --> 00:33:52,642
that Diana Santiago's
murder was an accident.

00:33:52,708 --> 00:33:56,008
We can't prove
either suspect committed murder.

00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:58,575
What we do know is
that Mrs. Santiago falsely

00:33:58,642 --> 00:33:59,575
imprisoned Alisa.

00:33:59,642 --> 00:34:01,382
So what do you want
to do about it?

00:34:01,448 --> 00:34:02,682
Julian lawyered up,

00:34:02,748 --> 00:34:05,082
so I guess we can take another
look at the mother.

00:34:05,148 --> 00:34:06,748
All right. I'll talk to her.

00:34:06,815 --> 00:34:09,515
We've spent some time
together, we've connected.

00:34:09,582 --> 00:34:10,782
That's not gonna happen.

00:34:12,148 --> 00:34:13,982
I'll talk to her.

00:34:14,048 --> 00:34:16,515
Good luck
with that, Nick.

00:34:16,582 --> 00:34:17,815
(clears throat)

00:34:17,882 --> 00:34:20,515
What?

00:34:20,582 --> 00:34:23,648
You know, I've been
where you've been, Sara.

00:34:23,715 --> 00:34:28,548
And sometimes I find it's
best to take a deep breath

00:34:28,615 --> 00:34:31,315
and walk away.

00:34:35,982 --> 00:34:37,082
What's up?

00:34:37,148 --> 00:34:41,115
Where's Mrs. Santiago?

00:34:41,182 --> 00:34:42,715
Her son got her a lawyer.

00:34:42,782 --> 00:34:43,748
(heavy sigh)

00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:45,882
That shuts us down.

00:34:45,948 --> 00:34:47,515
They buried those boys.

00:34:47,582 --> 00:34:51,015
And now that lawyer
is trying to bury us.

00:34:57,948 --> 00:35:00,667
LANGSTON: Well, we know what
there legal strategy's gonna be.

00:35:00,734 --> 00:35:01,707
Mom blames son.

00:35:01,774 --> 00:35:02,840
Son blames mom.

00:35:02,907 --> 00:35:04,840
Yeah, and if all else fails,
Mom pleads insanity.

00:35:04,907 --> 00:35:06,240
All they gotta dois send

00:35:06,307 --> 00:35:07,907
a jury through
this house, and she walks.

00:35:07,974 --> 00:35:09,607
They'll run
the clock down on us.

00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:11,440
(sighs)
We never found

00:35:11,507 --> 00:35:13,040
the source
of the arsenic.

00:35:13,107 --> 00:35:14,240
What about this red ribbon?

00:35:14,307 --> 00:35:16,207
STOKES: Hodges didn't
recover any trace.

00:35:16,274 --> 00:35:18,107
He sent swabs to DNA,
which came back negative.

00:35:18,174 --> 00:35:19,574
Was he looking for epithelials?

00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:22,507
That's a good question.

00:35:22,574 --> 00:35:24,874
LANGSTON:
Looks like the killer tore
these strands with his teeth.

00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,374
You see how the edges line up,

00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,940
one strand linking to another?

00:35:29,007 --> 00:35:30,674
So they're all
from the same roll.

00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:34,107
Which means we're looking
at a timeline of the murders.

00:35:34,174 --> 00:35:37,740
So, the boys
we identified--

00:35:37,807 --> 00:35:40,540
when did
the first victim disappear?

00:35:42,574 --> 00:35:45,540
Ryan Hoff went missing from the
halfway house 17 months ago.

00:35:45,607 --> 00:35:47,107
All right, what about
the second boy?

00:35:47,174 --> 00:35:49,607
Derrick Kennedy, ten months ago.

00:35:49,674 --> 00:35:52,207
Matthew Price, six months ago.

00:35:52,274 --> 00:35:54,307
Six months ago,
that's the last time

00:35:54,374 --> 00:35:56,340
the killer used
this roll of ribbon.

00:35:56,407 --> 00:36:00,040
So vagaries of time,
decomp, and the elements

00:36:00,107 --> 00:36:03,847
compromised the DNA
on these strands.

00:36:03,914 --> 00:36:05,714
But maybe it didn't
compromise the source.

00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,914
We need to find
that roll of ribbon.

00:36:10,314 --> 00:36:13,114
Is it wrong this place
is starting to feel like home?

00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:17,214
You guys got
a picture?

00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,014
Yes, Dr. Prescott and I
are with you now.

00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,847
Go ahead, Doctor.

00:36:20,914 --> 00:36:23,247
The last time I was
in the house,

00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:24,947
I remember seeing Christmas
decorations unopened.

00:36:25,014 --> 00:36:26,780
Stacked near the dresser.

00:36:26,847 --> 00:36:29,514
Okay. Which dresser?
It should be to the

00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:31,280
right of the window
near the bed.

00:36:31,347 --> 00:36:33,147
Got it.

00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:40,280
(sighs)

00:36:40,347 --> 00:36:42,247
This could take till Christmas.

00:36:42,314 --> 00:36:44,080
Not if you take into
account "churning."

00:36:44,147 --> 00:36:45,380
Churning?

00:36:45,447 --> 00:36:47,614
Over time, a hoarder's
stack of items gets

00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,214
shuffled and shifted
around; churned.

00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,214
How does this help us?
The roll of ribbon

00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,680
that you're looking for was
last used, what, six months ago?

00:36:53,747 --> 00:36:55,814
That's right.
So you might expect it
to be buried

00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,880
under six months of stuff.

00:36:56,947 --> 00:36:58,514
But it may, in fact,
have been churned

00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,547
somewhere closer
to the surface.

00:36:59,614 --> 00:37:01,380
Look for a reel
ribbon box.

00:37:01,447 --> 00:37:04,654
Marta tends to keep her items
in the original packaging.

00:37:07,754 --> 00:37:09,654
There's a box
of rat poison over here.

00:37:21,854 --> 00:37:23,754
Not exactly
the Christmas spirit.

00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:31,487
SIDLE: Arsenic in
its original packaging.

00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:39,154
Ribbon not so much.

00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:44,020
LANGSTON:
<i>We have your fingerprints.</i>

00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:50,354
<i>We have your DNA.</i>

00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:52,454
You brought this boy
into this home!

00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,754
He doesn't belong here!
He has to go!

00:37:57,254 --> 00:37:59,420
LANGSTON: <i>We know what happened
inside that house.</i>

00:37:59,487 --> 00:38:01,554
Your mother's illness was
hidden behind four walls,

00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:05,527
but yours was buried in a much
deeper place, wasn't it, Alisa?

00:38:05,594 --> 00:38:08,460
<i>Your mother caught you
dragging Matthew Price's body</i>

00:38:08,527 --> 00:38:11,527
<i>out to your little garden
of bones, didn't she?</i>

00:38:11,594 --> 00:38:14,860
She knew what you had
done to those boys.

00:38:14,927 --> 00:38:16,860
How you lured them
and seduced them.

00:38:16,927 --> 00:38:19,060
<i>Killed them.</i>

00:38:20,694 --> 00:38:22,960
<i>Buried them.</i>

00:38:23,027 --> 00:38:24,994
She knew she had to stop you.

00:38:26,427 --> 00:38:30,160
When I said my mother
did this to me, I meant it.

00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,960
She drove my father
to his death.

00:38:34,027 --> 00:38:36,360
Then she drove Julian away.

00:38:36,427 --> 00:38:37,860
She drove everyone away.

00:38:37,927 --> 00:38:39,727
Except those boys.

00:38:39,794 --> 00:38:41,227
You made sure of that.

00:38:41,294 --> 00:38:43,760
I hate her.

00:38:43,827 --> 00:38:45,027
Well, she loves you.

00:38:45,094 --> 00:38:48,094
Believe it or not,
she acted out of love.

00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,027
By chaining me up
like an animal?

00:38:50,094 --> 00:38:51,760
To protect you
from yourself

00:38:51,827 --> 00:38:54,694
and from people like me.

00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:57,060
Now, I understand

00:38:57,127 --> 00:38:59,394
why you didn't cry out when
we first entered that house.

00:39:02,167 --> 00:39:03,400
I want to go home.

00:39:03,467 --> 00:39:04,600
That's not going to happen.

00:39:04,667 --> 00:39:07,934
Are you sure about that?

00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,634
You said it yourself.

00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,667
I'm sick.

00:39:18,534 --> 00:39:22,634
JULIAN: I got out of that house
the first chance I could.

00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,600
Alisa wasn't so lucky.

00:39:24,667 --> 00:39:27,267
She was trapped
in my mother's insanity.

00:39:27,334 --> 00:39:30,500
It turned her
into a monster.

00:39:30,567 --> 00:39:32,434
I don't know.

00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,667
We're both
professionals, you know.

00:39:33,734 --> 00:39:35,234
We know that what
your sister did

00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:38,300
goes way beyond any damage that
your mother inflicted on her.

00:39:38,367 --> 00:39:40,967
Julian...

00:39:41,034 --> 00:39:43,400
your sister is a predator.

00:39:43,467 --> 00:39:45,934
Your mother's illness
is not what drove her to kill.

00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:48,834
I'm not so sure.

00:39:50,934 --> 00:39:51,967
My mother was
schizophrenic.

00:39:52,034 --> 00:39:54,400
One night,

00:39:54,467 --> 00:39:57,534
she got a butcher knife
out of a drawer.

00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,367
She walked into the bedroom.

00:39:59,434 --> 00:40:00,900
And while my father
was sleeping,

00:40:00,967 --> 00:40:02,174
she stabbed him in the heart.

00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,540
Again and again.

00:40:05,607 --> 00:40:08,207
To say that my childhood
was screwed up

00:40:08,274 --> 00:40:09,907
is an understatement.

00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:13,140
But I survived it.

00:40:13,207 --> 00:40:14,374
Just like you did.

00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,474
You and your sister
grew up together

00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:20,040
in that house, and you took
two completely different paths.

00:40:20,107 --> 00:40:23,040
Sometimes when we're faced
with crimes that are so...

00:40:23,107 --> 00:40:25,774
incomprehensible...

00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,307
we want answers.

00:40:27,374 --> 00:40:30,640
We want to believe that
there's some order to things.

00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,674
Sometimes there just isn't.

00:40:36,974 --> 00:40:40,174
I spoke to the DA
and the city attorney.

00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,774
If your mother agrees to get
help, they won't prosecute.

00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:47,274
What happens after that...

00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:49,507
that's up to you
and your mother.

00:40:55,107 --> 00:40:56,507
I can see your wheels turning.

00:40:56,574 --> 00:40:59,040
<i>¿En qué piensas?</i>

00:40:59,107 --> 00:41:00,340
What's on your mind, Nick?

00:41:00,407 --> 00:41:02,147
I still don't get it.

00:41:02,214 --> 00:41:05,314
The clutter or the pathology?

00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,380
Both.

00:41:07,447 --> 00:41:09,047
Hmm.

00:41:09,114 --> 00:41:10,747
The philosopher Erich Fromm,

00:41:10,814 --> 00:41:15,247
he forecast a, uh, society that
was obsessed with possessions.

00:41:15,314 --> 00:41:16,680
He believed that
human beings had

00:41:16,747 --> 00:41:20,314
two basic orientations:
having and being.

00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:23,147
Now, a person with a having
orientation seeks to acquire

00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:25,680
and possess things,
property, even people.

00:41:25,747 --> 00:41:27,480
But a person with
a being orientation

00:41:27,547 --> 00:41:29,247
focuses on the experience.

00:41:29,314 --> 00:41:31,080
They derive meaning
from exchanging,

00:41:31,147 --> 00:41:32,514
engaging and sharing
with other people.

00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:35,680
Sounds like
the right way to be.

00:41:35,747 --> 00:41:37,414
Unfortunately, Fromm also
predicted that a culture

00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,414
driven by commercialism,

00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,914
like the one
we live in today,

00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:42,580
is doomed to
the having orientation.

00:41:42,647 --> 00:41:44,747
Which leads to dissatisfaction
and emptiness.

00:41:44,814 --> 00:41:47,047
When you consider that,

00:41:47,114 --> 00:41:51,814
in 1960, there was no such thing
as public storage in America,

00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,480
today there's over two billion
square feet dedicated to it,

00:41:54,547 --> 00:41:56,114
makes you think he had a point.

00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,914
So, society's to blame,
is that it?

00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,520
The point is there's always
going to be extremes

00:42:01,587 --> 00:42:03,287
like Mrs. Santiago.

00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:04,654
Things don't have
to mean everything,

00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,587
nor do they have to be
devoid of meaning.

00:42:06,654 --> 00:42:08,287
They are one of
the ways in which

00:42:08,354 --> 00:42:09,920
we can experience
and enjoy life.

00:42:09,987 --> 00:42:12,454
As long as they don't
get in the way of living.

00:42:15,054 --> 00:42:17,420
SIDLE:
Here you go.

00:42:17,487 --> 00:42:19,554
Thank you.

00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,254
Will you be taking me home now?

00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:24,587
Actually, you'll be
going with your son.

00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:31,520
I guess it's for the best.

00:42:33,054 --> 00:42:35,387
I tried to be
a good mother.

00:42:35,454 --> 00:42:36,820
I know.

00:43:09,994 --> 00:43:10,927
Hey.

00:43:10,994 --> 00:43:13,227
Hey.

00:43:13,294 --> 00:43:16,560
I was heading out, I,
uh, saw your light on.

00:43:18,627 --> 00:43:21,060
Well, you know, this case
has compelled me to, uh,

00:43:21,127 --> 00:43:23,527
clean out this desk
once and for all.

00:43:23,594 --> 00:43:25,427
(both chuckle)

00:43:25,494 --> 00:43:26,427
How's that going?

00:43:26,494 --> 00:43:28,927
Oh, pretty good,
pretty good.

00:43:28,994 --> 00:43:32,494
You know, I almost threw out
something Grissom gave me.

00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,494
Ah, yeah.

00:43:36,594 --> 00:43:37,727
Blue marble.

00:43:37,794 --> 00:43:38,694
Oh.

00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:41,460
Mm-hmm.

00:43:41,527 --> 00:43:43,094
You know what he said
when he gave that to me?

00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,860
Something profound, I'm sure.

00:43:44,927 --> 00:43:46,960
He said, "Nicky...

00:43:47,027 --> 00:43:48,927
if life ever gets crazy..."

00:43:48,994 --> 00:43:51,694
"Roll with it."

00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,694
He gave me the same marble.

00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,694
(both laugh)

00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:57,994
You should hold
onto that.

00:43:58,060 --> 00:43:59,394
Yeah, right.
