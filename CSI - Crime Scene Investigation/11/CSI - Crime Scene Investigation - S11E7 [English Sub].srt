00:12:30,372 --> 00:12:32,339
Bullet in the head
for dessert.

00:12:32,405 --> 00:12:33,605
Well, we didn't find

00:12:33,672 --> 00:12:35,705
enough pieces to reconstruct
the name and number

00:12:35,772 --> 00:12:37,505
as it appears on the card, but

00:12:37,572 --> 00:12:39,605
we may not have to, because...

00:12:39,672 --> 00:12:41,605
we have this.

00:12:41,672 --> 00:12:43,039
The magnetic stripe.

00:12:43,105 --> 00:12:44,339
Cardholder's
name and number

00:12:44,405 --> 00:12:46,639
is encoded repeatedly, along
the length of the stripe.

00:12:46,705 --> 00:12:48,939
Yeah, all we need is
a section of it.

00:12:49,005 --> 00:12:52,105
Our victim's last supper
may tell us who he is.

00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:10,912
(beeping)

00:13:16,012 --> 00:13:17,945
(trilling)

00:13:22,412 --> 00:13:23,245
Larry LaMotte?!

00:13:23,312 --> 00:13:24,345
No way!

00:13:24,412 --> 00:13:26,279
You know this guy?

00:13:26,345 --> 00:13:29,312
Well, yeah, if it's
<i>the--Larry LaMotte.</i>

00:13:29,379 --> 00:13:30,779
Haven't you've seen
his online ads?

00:13:30,845 --> 00:13:31,712
Mm-mm.

00:13:31,779 --> 00:13:32,945
"How much would you pay

00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:34,179
"for peace of mind?

00:13:34,245 --> 00:13:37,479
Protect your identity
with I.D.-Preserve."

00:13:37,545 --> 00:13:39,545
He owns a credit
protection service.

00:13:39,612 --> 00:13:40,845
For a monthly fee,

00:13:40,912 --> 00:13:42,345
they help protect
your identity.

00:13:42,412 --> 00:13:44,012
I just signed
up last month.

00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,112
Since when do you worry

00:13:46,179 --> 00:13:47,545
about identity theft?

00:13:47,612 --> 00:13:49,645
Every aspect of our
life has been reduced

00:13:49,712 --> 00:13:51,712
to binary code, Nick.
All we are

00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:53,445
is zeroes and ones.

00:13:53,512 --> 00:13:54,912
Easy pickins.

00:13:54,979 --> 00:13:57,945
My name is Larry LaMotte, and
I want to ask you a question.

00:13:58,012 --> 00:14:00,012
How much would you pay
for peace of mind?

00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:03,152
<i>Well, the next few minutes
may answer that question and...</i>

00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:04,785
it may change your life.

00:14:04,852 --> 00:14:06,718
So, we checked
Larry LaMotte's house.

00:14:06,785 --> 00:14:09,618
No one home, and all his calls
went to voicemail.

00:14:09,685 --> 00:14:11,118
That's not a good sign.

00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:12,818
Good morning, gentlemen.

00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:13,985
How can I help you?

00:14:14,052 --> 00:14:15,318
I'm Detective James Brass,

00:14:15,385 --> 00:14:17,452
Las Vegas Police.
This is Dr. Ray Langston

00:14:17,518 --> 00:14:20,018
from the crime lab.
We're looking for Larry LaMotte.

00:14:20,085 --> 00:14:21,618
Oh, I'm sorry.
He's not available.

00:14:21,685 --> 00:14:23,318
May I ask
what this is concerning?

00:14:24,252 --> 00:14:26,052
And you are?
Oh. Elaine Travers.

00:14:26,118 --> 00:14:27,818
I'm his executive assistant.

00:14:27,885 --> 00:14:29,952
Gentlemen, I'm Julius Kaplan.

00:14:30,018 --> 00:14:31,052
I'm Mr. LaMotte's

00:14:31,118 --> 00:14:32,685
Head of Security.
Is there a problem?

00:14:32,752 --> 00:14:33,818
No, no problem, Julius.

00:14:33,885 --> 00:14:36,285
We think your boss
may be dead,

00:14:36,352 --> 00:14:37,985
so we need to ask
a few questions.

00:14:38,052 --> 00:14:39,485
There must be some
misunderstanding.

00:14:39,552 --> 00:14:41,352
Mr. LaMotte is on vacation.

00:14:41,419 --> 00:14:42,485
Where?

00:14:42,552 --> 00:14:43,752
At an undisclosed location,

00:14:43,819 --> 00:14:45,552
where, unfortunately,
he can't be reached.

00:14:45,619 --> 00:14:46,519
I'll say.

00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:47,919
It's okay, Julius.

00:14:47,985 --> 00:14:49,719
I can handle this.
Who are you?

00:14:49,785 --> 00:14:51,385
I'm Larry LaMotte.

00:14:51,452 --> 00:14:53,952
My name is Larry LaMotte, and
I want to ask you a question.

00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:55,385
How much would you pay for...?

00:14:55,452 --> 00:14:56,652
You're Larry LaMotte?
Yes.

00:14:56,719 --> 00:14:58,652
Now, did I hear
you gentlemen correctly?

00:14:58,719 --> 00:15:00,859
I'm dead?

00:15:08,638 --> 00:15:10,005
You look younger on TV.

00:15:10,071 --> 00:15:11,338
Better-looking, too, right?

00:15:11,405 --> 00:15:13,271
Marketing 101.

00:15:13,338 --> 00:15:15,271
(chuckles)
You got something to sell,

00:15:15,338 --> 00:15:17,371
hey, get someone pretty
to sell it, right?

00:15:17,438 --> 00:15:19,738
And who is the man in
front of the camera?

00:15:19,805 --> 00:15:21,738
Wesley.
Works in the mailroom.

00:15:21,805 --> 00:15:23,338
Yeah, he can't string

00:15:23,405 --> 00:15:26,205
two sentences together, but
put a script in front of him,

00:15:26,271 --> 00:15:27,571
suddenly, he's Brando.

00:15:27,638 --> 00:15:30,438
So, gentlemen,
what about this dead thing?

00:15:30,505 --> 00:15:33,505
Well, as I was, uh,
telling Mr. Kaplan,

00:15:33,571 --> 00:15:35,905
we found a body
shot in the head.

00:15:35,971 --> 00:15:38,505
Someone had force-fed
him credit cards.

00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:40,571
The credit cards
were in your name.

00:15:40,638 --> 00:15:41,838
My name?!

00:15:41,905 --> 00:15:44,505
Uh, I-I don't understand.

00:15:44,571 --> 00:15:46,605
Have your credit cards

00:15:46,671 --> 00:15:48,005
been lost or stolen?

00:15:48,071 --> 00:15:50,005
Did you know
that every 79 seconds,

00:15:50,071 --> 00:15:51,605
someone has
their identity stolen?

00:15:51,671 --> 00:15:53,538
It can take years,
thousands of dollars

00:15:53,605 --> 00:15:54,838
to get your good name back.

00:15:54,905 --> 00:15:56,005
LANGSTON:
Mr. LaMotte,

00:15:56,071 --> 00:15:57,338
if someone has
stolen your identity,

00:15:57,405 --> 00:15:58,871
and that person
has ended up dead,

00:15:58,938 --> 00:16:00,405
that raises some serious
questions for us.

00:16:00,471 --> 00:16:02,211
Like what?
BRASS:
Well, if someone

00:16:02,278 --> 00:16:04,878
stole your identity,
it can't be good for business.

00:16:04,945 --> 00:16:08,078
I'm the victim here, Detective.

00:16:08,145 --> 00:16:10,545
Our company has thousands
of subscribers.

00:16:10,611 --> 00:16:12,445
Corporate clients
who depend on us

00:16:12,511 --> 00:16:15,578
to protect their data,
their intellectual property.

00:16:15,645 --> 00:16:18,711
This company made
$120 million last year.

00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:20,211
KAPLAN: In other words,
why would we risk all that

00:16:20,278 --> 00:16:21,878
in order to go after

00:16:21,945 --> 00:16:23,945
some penny-ante
credit card thief?

00:16:24,011 --> 00:16:25,178
Well, that raises
the possibility

00:16:25,245 --> 00:16:26,645
that whoever murdered
our victim thinks

00:16:26,711 --> 00:16:28,111
they killed
the real Larry LaMotte.

00:16:28,178 --> 00:16:31,345
Do you have any
enemies, Larry?

00:16:31,411 --> 00:16:34,045
Thousands.

00:16:34,111 --> 00:16:36,478
Like you, I make it my mission
to stop criminals.

00:16:36,545 --> 00:16:37,811
You wear a badge,

00:16:37,878 --> 00:16:40,045
I wear the trust
of every client

00:16:40,111 --> 00:16:44,045
who pays $19 a month
to make sure that I'm watching.

00:16:44,111 --> 00:16:46,211
It'd be a lot easier
if you just got us a list.

00:16:46,278 --> 00:16:48,611
Elaine!

00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:55,745
The officers would like
to take a look

00:16:55,811 --> 00:16:56,911
at our offenders
files.

00:16:56,978 --> 00:16:58,078
And please get
two subscription

00:16:58,145 --> 00:16:59,245
packages ready.

00:16:59,311 --> 00:17:00,478
Don't worry.

00:17:00,545 --> 00:17:01,951
Our brothers

00:17:02,018 --> 00:17:04,618
in law enforcement
get a discount.

00:17:06,618 --> 00:17:08,551
STOKES:
<i>Larry LaMotte had a lot</i>

00:17:08,618 --> 00:17:10,251
of enemies,
but they're all his clients.

00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:13,385
Yeah, I see a couple
of thousand have filed
consumer complaints.

00:17:13,451 --> 00:17:14,718
Yeah, subscribers claimed

00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:16,285
that instead
of protecting their identities,

00:17:16,351 --> 00:17:17,585
the company stole them.

00:17:17,651 --> 00:17:19,585
Credit card numbers
found their way to Nigeria.

00:17:19,651 --> 00:17:22,885
And we know what happens in
Nigeria doesn't stay in Nigeria.

00:17:22,951 --> 00:17:24,351
I.D.-Preserve passed it off

00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:26,151
as "an unfortunate
security breach."

00:17:26,218 --> 00:17:27,985
But one guy didn't buy
that excuse.

00:17:28,051 --> 00:17:30,451
Lee Devries, 34.

00:17:30,518 --> 00:17:31,618
Machinist.

00:17:31,685 --> 00:17:32,851
He drove a truck

00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:34,585
right through the window
of I.D.-Preserve.

00:17:34,651 --> 00:17:36,118
Starts waving a gun around,

00:17:36,185 --> 00:17:38,151
demanding face-time
with Larry LaMotte.

00:17:38,218 --> 00:17:39,818
Six months in County.

00:17:39,885 --> 00:17:41,551
He got out four weeks ago.

00:17:41,618 --> 00:17:43,918
His first job out
of the joint-- working at

00:17:43,985 --> 00:17:47,618
a temp agency that supplies
workers to the shredder company.

00:17:47,685 --> 00:17:49,051
Sounds like somebody
worth talking to.

00:17:49,118 --> 00:17:51,218
I'll call Brass.

00:17:51,285 --> 00:17:52,218
Nicky?

00:17:52,285 --> 00:17:53,785
Yeah.
Were you planning

00:17:53,851 --> 00:17:54,951
on telling me that, uh,

00:17:55,018 --> 00:17:56,385
you stopped seeing
the departmental shrink?

00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:58,585
Oh, I didn't think
it was a big deal.

00:17:58,651 --> 00:18:00,551
I went my mandatory two times.

00:18:00,618 --> 00:18:02,391
I thought
that we talked about this.

00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:05,591
We did. I went.

00:18:05,658 --> 00:18:06,991
That's it? You're done?

00:18:07,058 --> 00:18:08,625
Look, I've been getting
in the gym,

00:18:08,691 --> 00:18:10,258
I've been eating right,
getting good sleep.

00:18:10,325 --> 00:18:11,591
Healthy body,
healthy mind, right?

00:18:13,991 --> 00:18:15,658
(sighs)

00:18:15,725 --> 00:18:17,591
Catherine...

00:18:17,658 --> 00:18:20,558
I can't sit in a room
and talk about how I feel

00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:22,125
from one minute to the next.

00:18:22,191 --> 00:18:23,391
It's just not my thing.

00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:25,825
Sure about that?

00:18:25,891 --> 00:18:27,425
Positive.

00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:34,891
BRASS:
<i>So, Lee,</i>

00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:36,991
where you been
the last 72 hours?

00:18:37,058 --> 00:18:39,425
Huh?

00:18:39,491 --> 00:18:41,791
Run into Larry LaMotte
by any chance?

00:18:41,858 --> 00:18:44,458
I'm gonna make
this simple.

00:18:44,525 --> 00:18:47,425
Have you put any bodies
into any shredders lately?

00:18:47,491 --> 00:18:49,758
All right, stand up.

00:18:49,825 --> 00:18:51,425
Stand up! Stand up!

00:18:53,025 --> 00:18:54,125
Back up.
Back up.

00:18:54,191 --> 00:18:55,391
Sit over there.

00:18:57,991 --> 00:19:00,258
All right, look...

00:19:00,325 --> 00:19:01,865
I'm going to be you.

00:19:01,931 --> 00:19:03,565
A more cooperative you.

00:19:03,631 --> 00:19:06,665
All right, Detective,
all right.

00:19:06,731 --> 00:19:08,098
I'll tell you what happened.

00:19:08,165 --> 00:19:10,431
Now you know that I ran
into Larry LaMotte.

00:19:10,498 --> 00:19:12,031
You know my history with him.

00:19:12,098 --> 00:19:14,265
I got jammed up,
and I got arrested.

00:19:14,331 --> 00:19:17,798
But as luck would have it,
I got a second chance at him.

00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:20,331
I gathered up
that bastard, right?

00:19:20,398 --> 00:19:22,465
I jammed credit cards
down his throat.

00:19:22,531 --> 00:19:24,631
I took out my gun,
I popped a cap

00:19:24,698 --> 00:19:25,798
right in his brain,

00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:27,631
and I took that mess
that used to be

00:19:27,698 --> 00:19:28,831
Larry LaMotte,
and you know what?

00:19:28,898 --> 00:19:30,665
I didn't know
what to do with it, so,

00:19:30,731 --> 00:19:33,331
I put it in-in the shredder
at my work.

00:19:33,398 --> 00:19:36,631
That was the end
of Larry LaMotte. Done.

00:19:38,565 --> 00:19:39,898
Questions?

00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:43,398
I don't know
what you're talking about.

00:19:43,465 --> 00:19:45,131
That's not a question.

00:19:45,198 --> 00:19:47,931
The guy destroyed my life.

00:19:47,998 --> 00:19:49,898
I signed up with
I.D.-Preserve

00:19:49,965 --> 00:19:52,765
'cause I was scared somebody
was going to steal my identity.

00:19:52,831 --> 00:19:56,131
And the next thing I know, I got
loans taken out in my name,

00:19:56,198 --> 00:19:59,098
I got mortgages, I got debts
I can't even begin to pay.

00:19:59,165 --> 00:20:00,798
Hell, they even
repossessed my truck

00:20:00,865 --> 00:20:02,671
right there
in that scumbag's window.

00:20:02,738 --> 00:20:04,605
You got an alibi?

00:20:04,671 --> 00:20:05,805
Six of 'em.

00:20:07,271 --> 00:20:09,605
Thanks to Larry LaMotte,
there's a half dozen guys

00:20:09,671 --> 00:20:12,071
running around out there
saying they're me.

00:20:17,805 --> 00:20:19,738
You running
the credit card

00:20:19,805 --> 00:20:21,605
we found in the
D.B.'s stomach?
Yeah.

00:20:21,671 --> 00:20:23,805
On the computer in the bullpen.

00:20:24,905 --> 00:20:27,538
Those are my numbers
on my computer.

00:20:27,605 --> 00:20:29,671
I'm checking
my purchases.

00:20:29,738 --> 00:20:32,771
Ever since that whole
I.D.-Preserve thing

00:20:32,838 --> 00:20:35,171
went shady,
I got a little paranoid.

00:20:35,238 --> 00:20:38,105
There are plenty of legit
companies doing this, but...

00:20:38,171 --> 00:20:40,871
I can't believe that I trusted
those guys.Yeah.

00:20:40,938 --> 00:20:43,305
It's like that friend that
you meet in science camp,

00:20:43,371 --> 00:20:45,738
and you find that you have
all the same interests,

00:20:45,805 --> 00:20:48,171
and you like to go to
all the same movies,

00:20:48,238 --> 00:20:49,838
and do all the
same things, and

00:20:49,905 --> 00:20:52,238
then one day,
he offers to give you a haircut.

00:20:52,305 --> 00:20:54,371
And you need one,
so you figure, why not?

00:20:54,438 --> 00:20:55,705
And then he starts
showing you

00:20:55,771 --> 00:20:57,038
this sketchbook, and swears

00:20:57,105 --> 00:20:58,738
that he's done nude drawings
of all his friends.

00:20:58,805 --> 00:21:00,671

00:21:00,738 --> 00:21:02,778
It's not the same.

00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:04,311
Oh, of course not, no.

00:21:04,378 --> 00:21:05,778
I'm... I'm sorry, G.

00:21:05,845 --> 00:21:07,211
I'm just feelin' ya.

00:21:07,278 --> 00:21:08,578
So, is this, uh,

00:21:08,645 --> 00:21:10,678
bullet fragment
telling you a story?

00:21:10,745 --> 00:21:12,111
Once upon a time, a cranium met

00:21:12,178 --> 00:21:13,778
a nine-by-19 millimeter
Parabellum round.

00:21:13,845 --> 00:21:14,945
The end.

00:21:15,011 --> 00:21:18,011
I found this other fragment
in the mix.

00:21:21,278 --> 00:21:23,511
SANDERS: It's tarnished,
encased in fibrous tissue.

00:21:23,578 --> 00:21:24,745
Looks old.

00:21:24,811 --> 00:21:26,245
The fragments from the bullet

00:21:26,311 --> 00:21:28,645
that went through Shredder Guy's
head show polygonal rifling,

00:21:28,711 --> 00:21:30,078
consistent with a Glock.

00:21:30,145 --> 00:21:32,311
Now, this other
fragment has

00:21:32,378 --> 00:21:34,211
conventional rifling.

00:21:34,278 --> 00:21:36,811
So, the older fragment
is from a different gun.

00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:40,511
Right, but could still
come from the same victim.

00:21:40,578 --> 00:21:41,811
How?

00:21:41,878 --> 00:21:43,045
A previous incident.

00:21:43,111 --> 00:21:45,511
It shows signs
of encapsulation.

00:21:45,578 --> 00:21:47,078
<i>Over time,</i>

00:21:53,978 --> 00:21:57,545
So far, we have nothing
to identify our shredder guy.

00:21:57,611 --> 00:22:00,011
Maybe this shred
of evidence will help.

00:22:00,078 --> 00:22:01,718
It's at least worth
a good cleaning.

00:22:04,151 --> 00:22:05,718
So we sorted through
the shredded items

00:22:05,785 --> 00:22:08,185
in the load with our dead body,
and discovered something.

00:22:08,251 --> 00:22:10,885
Most of it can be traced
back to one place.

00:22:10,951 --> 00:22:13,085
Let me guess:
I.D.-Preserve.

00:22:13,151 --> 00:22:15,585
So, I'm thinking, maybe

00:22:15,651 --> 00:22:18,018
the body is in one
of these bins that I.D.-Preserve

00:22:18,085 --> 00:22:19,818
uses to send stuff
to the shredder.

00:22:19,885 --> 00:22:21,985
And maybe our friend Larry
LaMotte's hands aren't so clean.

00:22:22,051 --> 00:22:24,518
Well, I bet that
he would say

00:22:24,585 --> 00:22:25,918
that when these bins
left his office,

00:22:25,985 --> 00:22:27,085
there was no body inside.

00:22:27,151 --> 00:22:29,518
Which is why
I did some checking.

00:22:29,585 --> 00:22:31,585
I.D.-Preserve uses
a subcontractor

00:22:31,651 --> 00:22:33,718
to handle transport
of its bins.

00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:35,151
Guess who runs that company?

00:22:35,218 --> 00:22:37,485

00:29:41,409 --> 00:29:43,376
which obscures our view.

00:29:43,443 --> 00:29:46,443
It's not a lot to work with, but

00:29:46,509 --> 00:29:48,009
I might be able
to work a little magic.

00:29:48,076 --> 00:29:49,243
STOKES:
Hey, Catherine?

00:29:49,309 --> 00:29:51,743
Stay with it.
Yeah.

00:29:51,809 --> 00:29:53,143
Ballistics confirms
that the Glock I found

00:29:53,209 --> 00:29:54,543
on top of the
can of clams

00:29:54,609 --> 00:29:55,943
was the gun that
killed Shredder Guy.

00:29:56,009 --> 00:29:57,709
Oh, we liked
the French Chef for the deed.

00:29:57,776 --> 00:29:58,976
No, Sara called
that one right.

00:29:59,043 --> 00:30:00,576
It just wasn't the gun
that killed Julius.

00:30:00,643 --> 00:30:02,009
Hmm.
That was a Colt
.45 pistol.

00:30:02,076 --> 00:30:03,716
And that gun
has a history.

00:30:03,783 --> 00:30:07,283
Slug matches a robbery/shooting
in Reno six years ago?

00:30:07,349 --> 00:30:10,616
Yeah, some guy was found
in a Dumpster, barely alive.

00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:12,216
Paramedics rushed him
to the E.R.

00:30:12,283 --> 00:30:15,083
72 hours later, he just walks
out of the hospital, vanishes.

00:30:15,149 --> 00:30:16,249
John Doe.

00:30:16,316 --> 00:30:19,716
So, Reno P.D. sent over
the cold case file.

00:30:19,783 --> 00:30:22,949
Here is his shirt
from the E.R.

00:30:24,649 --> 00:30:26,416
These frags have some fuzz
on them.

00:30:26,483 --> 00:30:28,683
Nobody's perfect.
Kind of looks like a Chia Pet.

00:30:31,249 --> 00:30:33,749
Hmm. Cartridge case
from the shooting.

00:30:33,816 --> 00:30:35,383
Weren't able
to pull a print, though, huh?

00:30:35,449 --> 00:30:37,916
No, the only good thing
about a case going cold is

00:30:37,983 --> 00:30:39,716
that technology
has a chance to catch up.

00:30:39,783 --> 00:30:41,116
Might get something now.

00:30:41,183 --> 00:30:43,549
Okay, so we've got two
shootings, six years apart.

00:30:43,616 --> 00:30:46,116
Julius Kaplan
and a John Doe in an alley

00:30:46,183 --> 00:30:47,716
shot with a
Colt pistol.

00:30:47,783 --> 00:30:49,516
There's got
to be a connection somehow.

00:30:49,583 --> 00:30:52,083
WILLOWS: Let's clean up
these frags, see what we get.

00:31:21,656 --> 00:31:24,589
♪ ♪

00:31:52,223 --> 00:31:53,723
All right,
let me get this straight.

00:31:53,789 --> 00:31:56,489
A partial bullet fragment from
a previous injury lodged inside

00:31:56,556 --> 00:31:58,456
Shredder Guy
is a perfect match

00:31:58,523 --> 00:32:00,489
to a round found
in a John Doe

00:32:00,556 --> 00:32:02,229
six years ago?

00:32:02,296 --> 00:32:03,629
Shredder Guy and John Doe

00:32:03,696 --> 00:32:05,796
are the same person--
<i>were--the same person.</i>

00:32:05,863 --> 00:32:10,563
<i>Six years ago, Shredder Guy is
shot in the alley,</i>

00:32:10,629 --> 00:32:12,163
<i>robbed and left for dead.</i>

00:32:12,229 --> 00:32:15,863
<i>Yet, he survives,
skips town and disappears.</i>

00:32:15,929 --> 00:32:18,096
Flash forward six years.

00:32:18,163 --> 00:32:20,163
Shredder Guy
returns here to Vegas

00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:21,896
with Larry LaMotte's
stolen identity.

00:32:21,963 --> 00:32:25,796
But bad news for him,
he runs into Julius Kaplan...

00:32:25,863 --> 00:32:28,063
(coughing)

00:32:28,129 --> 00:32:30,696
<i>...who cooks him
a special meal.</i>

00:32:30,763 --> 00:32:33,363
(crying)
<i>And then kills him
with a Glock.</i>

00:32:33,429 --> 00:32:35,763
Then someone kills
Julius Kaplan,

00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:38,029
using the same Colt pistol
that shot Shredder Guy

00:32:38,096 --> 00:32:39,929
six years ago in the alley.

00:32:39,996 --> 00:32:41,096
Two crimes, same shooter?

00:32:41,163 --> 00:32:42,263
Could be.

00:32:42,329 --> 00:32:44,863
It doesn't make sense,
Catherine.

00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:46,763
Shredder Guy had a credit card

00:32:46,829 --> 00:32:48,263
in Larry LaMotte's name
sent to him

00:32:48,329 --> 00:32:49,763
in New Mexico,
where he was living.

00:32:49,829 --> 00:32:52,563
So, why would an identity thief
come all the way to Vegas

00:32:52,629 --> 00:32:54,196
to commit fraud
in Larry LaMotte's backyard?

00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:55,696
Right.

00:32:55,763 --> 00:32:58,696
Maybe he just wanted a free trip
to Vegas on Larry's dime.

00:32:58,763 --> 00:33:01,096
Maybe he wanted Larry LaMotte
to know he was in town.

00:33:01,163 --> 00:33:03,036
Either way,
something else is going on.

00:33:03,103 --> 00:33:04,803
I mean, Julius Kaplan
said it himself.

00:33:04,869 --> 00:33:05,936
"Why kill
a penny-ante thief?"

00:33:06,003 --> 00:33:07,936
He's not worth the risk.

00:33:08,003 --> 00:33:09,969
Well, he might be,
if the thief is threatening

00:33:10,036 --> 00:33:11,203
to bring down the entire

00:33:11,269 --> 00:33:13,369
I.D.-Preserve empire.

00:33:13,436 --> 00:33:15,603
Facial recognition got
a hit on Shredder Guy.

00:33:15,669 --> 00:33:17,103
DMV in Florida

00:33:17,169 --> 00:33:18,769
had a ten-year-old
driver's license on file.

00:33:18,836 --> 00:33:19,936
Check out the name.

00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:28,103
Shredder Guy
is Larry LaMotte?

00:33:28,169 --> 00:33:29,169
The real Larry LaMotte.

00:33:29,236 --> 00:33:30,269
Well, if he's
Larry LaMotte,

00:33:30,336 --> 00:33:32,003
then who's Larry LaMotte?

00:33:40,103 --> 00:33:41,769
See this cartridge case?

00:33:41,836 --> 00:33:44,036
We pulled a six-year-old
print off it.

00:33:44,103 --> 00:33:46,269
It has all the personal
information we need

00:33:46,336 --> 00:33:49,036
to identify you.

00:33:49,103 --> 00:33:51,936
You have a very
impressive CV.

00:33:52,003 --> 00:33:57,236
Burglary, fraud,
and identity theft.

00:33:57,303 --> 00:33:59,269
BRASS:
Goodbye, Larry LaMotte.

00:33:59,336 --> 00:34:01,703
Hello, Arlo Karden.
Arlo Karden doesn't have

00:34:01,769 --> 00:34:03,276
the same ring to it,
I'll give you that.

00:34:03,343 --> 00:34:05,943
We searched your house.
Guess what we found.

00:34:06,009 --> 00:34:08,709
A Colt pistol.

00:34:08,776 --> 00:34:11,109
The print on that
cartridge casing

00:34:11,176 --> 00:34:12,876
puts you in an alley
six years ago

00:34:12,943 --> 00:34:16,243
with, given his penchant
for credit card fraud,

00:34:16,309 --> 00:34:18,443
I'm guessing your old
partner in crime.

00:34:18,509 --> 00:34:20,309
The real Larry LaMotte.

00:34:20,376 --> 00:34:22,143
(Larry groans)

00:34:22,209 --> 00:34:25,443
(gun fires)

00:34:25,509 --> 00:34:28,309
You thought
you'd killed him.

00:34:28,376 --> 00:34:30,709
You thought it was safe
to use his name. Good name.

00:34:30,776 --> 00:34:32,043
Not in the system,
like yours.

00:34:32,109 --> 00:34:34,409
We, uh...

00:34:34,476 --> 00:34:37,276
searched your
phone records.

00:34:37,343 --> 00:34:39,443
You received calls

00:34:39,509 --> 00:34:42,076
from a prepaid cell,
in Gallup, New Mexico.

00:34:42,143 --> 00:34:44,609
BRASS: I-I can just
imagine, you know,

00:34:44,676 --> 00:34:46,943
the real Larry,
you know, watching TV,

00:34:47,009 --> 00:34:49,476
and seeing some geezer
making money off his name.

00:34:49,543 --> 00:34:50,909
So he gets on the Internet,

00:34:50,976 --> 00:34:52,143
does a little search

00:34:52,209 --> 00:34:54,943
of the profiles
of big-time CEOs,

00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:57,309
and then up pops a picture: You.

00:34:57,376 --> 00:34:59,876
LANGSTON: Larry called
you up, offered you

00:34:59,943 --> 00:35:02,816
"peace of mind" for a price.

00:35:02,883 --> 00:35:04,216
But you don't pay retail,

00:35:04,283 --> 00:35:06,616
so you get Julius Kaplan
to get you a discount.

00:35:08,383 --> 00:35:10,249
Which only leaves one loose end.

00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:11,583
Here you go.

00:35:13,916 --> 00:35:14,949
(shot fires)

00:35:17,083 --> 00:35:19,383
I didn't kill anyone.

00:35:19,449 --> 00:35:20,983
Larry said he wanted

00:35:21,049 --> 00:35:23,283
five million dollars.

00:35:23,349 --> 00:35:24,949
Yeah, yeah, we were partners

00:35:25,016 --> 00:35:26,916
back in the day.

00:35:26,983 --> 00:35:28,483
Hell, I figured
after all that time,

00:35:28,549 --> 00:35:30,783
I mean, I... I owed him.

00:35:30,849 --> 00:35:32,483
So I gave him
the money.

00:35:32,549 --> 00:35:36,383
KARDEN: <i>I instructed Julius
to deliver the cash.</i>

00:35:37,983 --> 00:35:39,549
After that, well...

00:35:39,616 --> 00:35:41,816
I think we all
know what happened.

00:35:41,883 --> 00:35:44,483
Yeah, everybody always
blames the dead guy.

00:35:44,549 --> 00:35:46,649
I'm not the same guy
in that alley.

00:35:48,349 --> 00:35:50,283
Not anymore.

00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:53,283
A man can change.

00:35:53,349 --> 00:35:55,049
As far as
that gun goes,

00:35:55,116 --> 00:35:57,816
that doesn't prove anything.

00:35:57,883 --> 00:35:59,449
I got workers.

00:35:59,516 --> 00:36:03,056
I got people coming in and out
of that house all day long.

00:36:03,123 --> 00:36:05,656
And as far
as six years ago goes,

00:36:05,723 --> 00:36:07,623
my attorney informs me that,
in the state of Nevada,

00:36:07,689 --> 00:36:10,823
the statute of limitations
on assault, even with a gun,

00:36:10,889 --> 00:36:14,223
is two years.

00:36:14,289 --> 00:36:15,489
(sniffs)

00:36:15,556 --> 00:36:17,556
Yeah, I shot Larry LaMotte.

00:36:17,623 --> 00:36:20,456
I stole his name.
I left him for dead.

00:36:20,523 --> 00:36:22,456
But I only killed him once.

00:36:22,523 --> 00:36:24,923
STOKES:
<i>I checked with the bank.</i>

00:36:24,989 --> 00:36:28,089
Arlo may be telling the truth,
at least about one thing.

00:36:28,156 --> 00:36:30,589
He made a withdrawal
four days ago,

00:36:30,656 --> 00:36:32,156
five million in cash.

00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:34,723
So, what, you think he's trying
to pay off the real Larry?

00:36:34,789 --> 00:36:35,789
Oh, it's possible.

00:36:35,856 --> 00:36:37,723
Maybe "Julius Child"
went off-recipe

00:36:37,789 --> 00:36:40,223
and whacked the real Larry to
keep the five mill for himself.

00:36:40,289 --> 00:36:42,223
It would give Arlo
motive to kill him.

00:36:42,289 --> 00:36:43,556
He wanted his money back.

00:36:43,623 --> 00:36:45,789
Well, one problem:
We searched Arlo's house,

00:36:45,856 --> 00:36:47,556
Julius's house,
I.D.-Preserve.

00:36:47,623 --> 00:36:48,689
Where's the
five million?

00:36:48,756 --> 00:36:49,689
Oh, hey, Cath...

00:36:50,856 --> 00:36:52,123
I got something.

00:36:52,189 --> 00:36:54,156
I used Digital Frame Averaging

00:36:54,223 --> 00:36:55,589
to process
the surveillance footage

00:36:55,656 --> 00:36:57,823
we got from the neighbor
across the street

00:36:57,889 --> 00:36:59,356
from Julius
Kaplan's house.

00:37:01,623 --> 00:37:03,929
Program got us a partial plate.

00:37:11,129 --> 00:37:12,996
Car was rented two days ago

00:37:13,063 --> 00:37:15,929
by one Mr. Lee Devries.

00:37:15,996 --> 00:37:17,963
That's the guy
that drove his truck

00:37:18,029 --> 00:37:19,263
through the window

00:37:19,329 --> 00:37:20,396
of I.D.-Preserve.

00:37:20,463 --> 00:37:21,763
Guess he got
a little payback.

00:37:21,829 --> 00:37:23,296
WILLOWS:
<i>Brass sent units</i>

00:37:23,363 --> 00:37:24,663
to Lee Devries' place.
He wasn't there.

00:37:24,729 --> 00:37:26,029
He didn't show up
for work, either.

00:37:26,096 --> 00:37:27,396
The neighbor said
that he was visiting

00:37:27,463 --> 00:37:28,429
his girlfriend
in Henderson.

00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:29,963
(cell phone ringing)

00:37:30,029 --> 00:37:32,429
Well, if he's got a briefcase
with five million dollars in it,

00:37:32,496 --> 00:37:33,896
he's heading to Mexico.

00:37:33,963 --> 00:37:35,963
Langston.
Yeah, Jim.

00:37:36,029 --> 00:37:38,996
A patrol just spotted
Devries's rental car.

00:37:39,063 --> 00:37:40,096
Heading south?

00:37:40,163 --> 00:37:42,063
Got it.

00:37:42,129 --> 00:37:43,896
(siren wailing)

00:37:43,963 --> 00:37:46,129
(indistinct radio transmission)

00:37:53,296 --> 00:37:56,129
Lee Devries!
Las Vegas Police!

00:37:56,196 --> 00:37:57,529
Devries, get out of the car!

00:38:09,936 --> 00:38:11,636
BRASS:
Step away from the car.

00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:18,103
(handcuffs rattling)

00:38:22,836 --> 00:38:25,469
BRASS:
Information is currency.

00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,003
That's what they say.

00:38:27,069 --> 00:38:29,236
And you turned it
into cold, hard cash.

00:38:29,303 --> 00:38:31,903
The all-knowing
executive assistant.

00:38:31,969 --> 00:38:34,236
Knows every phone call,

00:38:34,303 --> 00:38:35,569
every meeting,
every e-mail,

00:38:35,636 --> 00:38:39,136
every intimate detail
of the boss's life.

00:38:39,203 --> 00:38:41,769
You knew the real Larry.
You knew about the blackmail.

00:38:41,836 --> 00:38:44,803
You knew about your boss
withdrawing five million bucks.

00:38:44,869 --> 00:38:46,069
You even knew

00:38:46,136 --> 00:38:48,436
about "Julius Child" and
his skills in the kitchen.

00:38:48,503 --> 00:38:51,203
Saw an opportunity for
a little quid pro quo.

00:38:52,969 --> 00:38:54,336
The thing about the "quo" is,

00:38:54,403 --> 00:38:56,203
it's a lot sweeter
when you don't have to share.

00:38:59,436 --> 00:39:00,436
(shot fires)

00:39:00,503 --> 00:39:02,909
He was a pig.

00:39:02,976 --> 00:39:04,509
Just like my boss.

00:39:04,576 --> 00:39:07,976
And the "quid pro quo"
started a long time ago.

00:39:08,043 --> 00:39:11,609
Except then, it was about
holding on to my job.

00:39:11,676 --> 00:39:15,276
"Honey, can you
grab me a cup of coffee?"

00:39:15,343 --> 00:39:16,943
"Honey, can you pick up
my dry cleaning?"

00:39:17,009 --> 00:39:19,143
"Sweetheart,

00:39:19,209 --> 00:39:20,609
"can you come
by my place tonight?

00:39:20,676 --> 00:39:23,409
I need a little <i>help--
with something."</i>

00:39:23,476 --> 00:39:25,143
You used your boss's gun.

00:39:25,209 --> 00:39:26,543
We spoke with
Lee Devries.

00:39:26,609 --> 00:39:29,743
He confirms someone accessed
one of his accounts.

00:39:29,809 --> 00:39:32,243
You used his identity
to rent a getaway car

00:39:32,309 --> 00:39:34,276
that you planned to
dump at the border.

00:39:34,343 --> 00:39:37,043
And with five million dollars
missing, well...

00:39:37,109 --> 00:39:39,809
naturally, we'd be looking
for Devries and not for you.

00:39:39,876 --> 00:39:41,443
And thanks to I.D.-Preserve,

00:39:41,509 --> 00:39:45,443
you had all his credit
card information.

00:39:45,509 --> 00:39:46,976
Easy peasy.

00:39:47,043 --> 00:39:50,209
Like you said, I know every
detail about my boss's life.

00:39:50,276 --> 00:39:52,209
His business, too.

00:39:52,276 --> 00:39:53,809
He ruined a lot of lives.

00:39:53,876 --> 00:39:56,809
People who trusted him,
like Devries.

00:39:56,876 --> 00:39:58,709
A little justice

00:39:58,776 --> 00:40:00,949
for all of them has got
to be worth something.

00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:06,383
Information's currency, right?

00:40:06,449 --> 00:40:10,149
STOKES:
<i>Elaine Travers pled out,</i>

00:40:10,216 --> 00:40:11,583
gave up her boss.

00:40:11,649 --> 00:40:13,016
With all those
defrauded clients,

00:40:13,083 --> 00:40:15,449
he's looking at identity
theft times a thousand.

00:40:15,516 --> 00:40:17,283
Larry Arlo, whoever
the hell he is,

00:40:17,349 --> 00:40:18,449
he's not going
to be getting

00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:20,249
much peace of mind
over the next 12 years.

00:40:20,316 --> 00:40:22,283
His fellow inmates better keep
their hands in their pockets.

00:40:22,349 --> 00:40:23,283
Mm-hmm.

00:40:23,349 --> 00:40:24,649
Hey, you out of here?

00:40:24,716 --> 00:40:27,016
Yeah, yeah, I think I'm
gonna grab a beer or ten.

00:40:27,083 --> 00:40:28,083
You want to join me?

00:40:28,149 --> 00:40:29,483
I don't think so.

00:40:29,549 --> 00:40:31,416
You sure? We can talk
about our feelings.

00:40:31,483 --> 00:40:32,416
(chuckles)

00:40:32,483 --> 00:40:33,749
I'll see you tomorrow.

00:40:33,816 --> 00:40:36,316
SANDERS: I don't live in
Kyrgyzstan, I've never

00:40:36,383 --> 00:40:39,783
even been to Kyrgyzstan,
so how could I spend $1,200

00:40:39,849 --> 00:40:41,416
on snacks
and a yurt?

00:40:41,483 --> 00:40:44,116
It's unfortunate.

00:40:44,183 --> 00:40:47,649
I mean, not only Greg's
identity theft issues,

00:40:47,716 --> 00:40:50,616
but, uh, our man-date.
It's been postponed.

00:40:50,683 --> 00:40:51,749
Your mandate?

00:40:51,816 --> 00:40:52,816
No, no, no.

00:40:52,883 --> 00:40:55,383
Not a mandate.
It's a man-date.

00:40:55,449 --> 00:40:57,249
It was actually Greg's idea.

00:40:57,316 --> 00:40:58,983
Um, we...

00:40:59,049 --> 00:41:00,983
meet at the same time
every week, so that I can

00:41:01,049 --> 00:41:02,289
put Wendy behind me.

00:41:02,356 --> 00:41:04,223
You know, so,
uh, you look...

00:41:04,289 --> 00:41:05,956
very nice.Thanks.

00:41:06,023 --> 00:41:06,989
Do you have plans?

00:41:07,056 --> 00:41:08,489
Yeah.

00:41:08,556 --> 00:41:10,656
Well. Okay.

00:41:10,723 --> 00:41:11,989
(Sanders continues
indistinctly)

00:41:12,056 --> 00:41:13,589
Hey, did you get a haircut?

00:41:13,656 --> 00:41:17,389
Uh, no.

00:41:17,456 --> 00:41:18,889
Why? Did, um...

00:41:18,956 --> 00:41:21,823
Did Greg happen to
mention something, or...?

00:41:21,889 --> 00:41:23,923
No.
Oh.

00:41:23,989 --> 00:41:26,789
I mean, he might have mentioned
something about a science camp.

00:41:26,856 --> 00:41:29,589
But you know
how people talk.

00:41:37,956 --> 00:41:39,556
I could show you
mine, but I think

00:41:39,623 --> 00:41:42,323
that might be
inappropriate.

00:41:42,389 --> 00:41:44,623
You hardly
notice them.

00:41:44,689 --> 00:41:47,389
Scars?
Mm.

00:41:47,456 --> 00:41:49,023
Of course...

00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:51,456
some scars
heal faster than others.

00:41:54,689 --> 00:41:56,556
I got a letter
from Nate Haskell

00:41:56,623 --> 00:41:58,256
the other day.

00:41:59,656 --> 00:42:03,496
He wanted to let me know that,
uh, he was thinking about me.

00:42:03,563 --> 00:42:05,596
The kidney bean?

00:42:05,663 --> 00:42:07,163
Yeah.

00:42:07,229 --> 00:42:08,663
Don't let him get
into your head, Ray.

00:42:08,729 --> 00:42:11,863
Well, he's already in there.

00:42:13,863 --> 00:42:14,896
Everything that happens to us,

00:42:14,963 --> 00:42:16,796
the good and the bad,
is part of us.

00:42:16,863 --> 00:42:20,129
Took me a long time
to realize that, uh...

00:42:20,196 --> 00:42:22,896
it doesn't have
to define who we are,

00:42:22,963 --> 00:42:25,263
We get to decide that.

00:42:28,063 --> 00:42:30,063
Good night, Dr. Ray.

00:42:30,129 --> 00:42:31,863
Good night, Sarah.
