it out of there,

00:02:18,498 --> 00:02:20,137

into this pool.

Nice to meet you.

You, too.

00:02:36,616 --> 00:02:39,085
How soon can we get
the shark out of here?

00:02:39,085 --> 00:02:40,787
I need to get my victim
out of the pool.

00:02:40,787 --> 00:02:42,655
Well, just give us
a few minutes to pull it out.

00:02:42,655 --> 00:02:43,890
Saltwater tiger shark

00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:46,136
in a freshwater pool is
a lethal combination.

00:02:46,136 --> 00:02:48,528
Shark population
worldwide is in decline

00:02:48,528 --> 00:02:49,963
without crazy
stuff like this.

00:02:49,963 --> 00:02:51,133
All right,
guys, let's go.

00:02:51,133 --> 00:02:52,799

can save her.

Higher, higher.
WILLOWS:
I don't know what to tell you.

00:02:55,134 --> 00:02:56,870
Shark got tired of
entertaining the guests

00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:59,134
and busted out of the tank.

00:02:59,134 --> 00:03:02,139
Well, Conrad, it's 120 degrees
out here and we're pulling

00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:03,843
a young dead woman
out of the pool.

00:03:03,843 --> 00:03:06,133
That's it, that's all
I got for you right now.

00:03:06,133 --> 00:03:07,881
Hey, sorry, I'm late.
I had an appointment.

00:03:07,881 --> 00:03:09,749
I heard it over the
squawk. What's going on?

00:03:09,749 --> 00:03:10,784
You kidding me?!

00:03:10,784 --> 00:03:12,132
I got enough problems

00:03:12,132 --> 00:03:13,586
in the casino.

00:03:13,586 --> 00:03:15,134
Now I got people
going out in body bags?

00:03:15,134 --> 00:03:17,137
Besides me,
who's in charge here?

00:03:17,137 --> 00:03:18,137
CSI Willows.

00:03:18,137 --> 00:03:19,137
This is Nick Stokes.

00:03:19,137 --> 00:03:20,593
Willows?

00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,930
You're Sam's little girl, right?

00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:27,137
No, I'm a big girl, telling you
to step behind the tape

00:03:27,137 --> 00:03:28,768

00:03:28,768 --> 00:03:30,770

00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,972
Always got his way,
one way or the other.

00:03:32,972 --> 00:03:34,874
You should discuss
this someplace else.

00:03:34,874 --> 00:03:36,743
I got it, Nicky.

00:03:36,743 --> 00:03:37,744
Mr. Boozell,

00:03:37,744 --> 00:03:39,546
we're here to
investigate.

00:03:39,546 --> 00:03:41,140
This is an active
crime scene.

00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:43,135
I wouldn't even let
the sheriff past that tape,

00:03:43,135 --> 00:03:45,137
so consider this conversation
a luxury.

00:03:45,137 --> 00:03:48,955

you can go back doing yours.

HOLLOWAY: So, all sharks arrive
from back of house.

00:04:42,137 --> 00:04:44,132
Most from Eastern waters,

00:04:44,132 --> 00:04:47,139
off the Keys,
Montauk, Costa Rica.

00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:50,850
They arrive via truck,
in water tanks.

00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:53,131
They're humanely transported.

00:04:53,131 --> 00:04:56,723
I put them in the aquarium,
help them survive the shock.

00:04:56,723 --> 00:04:59,137
Now they're in show business.

00:04:59,137 --> 00:05:01,138
Well, I guess that's one way
to make a living.

00:05:01,138 --> 00:05:03,530
How many tiger sharks do you
have in your tank currently?

00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:05,133
HOLLOWAY:
Well, we try
to keep it

00:05:05,133 --> 00:05:06,432
to three or four.

00:05:06,432 --> 00:05:08,868
Any more than that and they
start to turn on each other.

00:05:08,868 --> 00:05:10,137
Let's put it this way,

00:05:10,137 --> 00:05:12,605
it's a very challenging
little ecosystem.

00:05:12,605 --> 00:05:14,474
All right, well,
I'm gonna ask the obvious.

00:05:14,474 --> 00:05:17,133
Is there a tiger shark
that's missing from this tank?

00:05:17,133 --> 00:05:18,912
Well, Mr. Boozell
wants you to know that,

00:05:18,912 --> 00:05:21,138
no, all tiger sharks
are accounted for.

00:05:21,138 --> 00:05:23,850
He also wants you to know
that this aquarium right here

00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:26,519
is built with
eight inches of Plexiglas

00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:28,139
and uses a completely different
plumbing system

00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:29,622
than the pool.

00:05:29,622 --> 00:05:30,924
He also wants you to know

00:05:30,924 --> 00:05:33,132
that if you don't
take his word for it,

00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:35,136
you can just suit up
and see for yourself.

00:05:35,136 --> 00:05:38,531
I do count four tiger sharks
in the tank.

00:05:38,531 --> 00:05:40,934
Just like it says
in the manifest there. Four.

00:05:40,934 --> 00:05:43,136
Thank you, Dr. Holloway.

00:05:43,136 --> 00:05:45,140
BOOZELL:

00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,739

00:05:46,739 --> 00:05:48,708
Still here?

00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:50,132
How's my day club?
Up and running yet?

00:05:51,136 --> 00:05:52,845
If you want me

00:05:52,845 --> 00:05:55,515
to break down
the financials for you,

00:05:55,515 --> 00:05:56,616
I'll be glad to do it.

00:05:56,616 --> 00:05:57,617
I'll do it, anyway.

00:05:57,617 --> 00:05:59,519
My night club makes

00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:01,788
three to five million
on a sold-out weekend.

00:06:01,788 --> 00:06:05,525
The day club, H2O,
does seven to ten million.

00:06:05,525 --> 00:06:08,595
Not to mention the 20 mil
that they drop inside.

00:06:08,595 --> 00:06:10,029
It's just like this town:
one minute you're flush,

00:06:10,029 --> 00:06:11,131
the next you're bust.

00:06:11,131 --> 00:06:13,566
Spoken just like
a true mogul's daughter.

00:06:13,566 --> 00:06:15,001
What made you become a cop?

00:06:15,001 --> 00:06:16,136
I happen to love my job,

00:06:16,136 --> 00:06:18,132
and could you please
leave my father out of this?

00:06:18,132 --> 00:06:21,135
Well, I love my job, too,
and I got to get back to it.

00:06:21,135 --> 00:06:23,910
The manifests don't lie.

00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:27,647
It's clear that the shark in the
pool did not come from my tank.

00:06:27,647 --> 00:06:28,982
Well, it had to
come from somewhere.

00:06:28,982 --> 00:06:31,751
Well, maybe it checked in
last night, VIP.

00:06:31,751 --> 00:06:34,821
No, VIS-- Very Important Shark.

00:06:34,821 --> 00:06:37,924
He checked in, took a dip
in the pool this morning,

00:06:37,924 --> 00:06:39,133
had a bite to eat.

00:06:39,133 --> 00:06:41,027
Now he's on the hook for murder.

00:06:41,027 --> 00:06:42,629
SIDLE:
All right,
you're right, sir.

00:06:42,629 --> 00:06:44,664
Your manifest did check out,
but we're far from done.

00:06:44,664 --> 00:06:47,131
Now we need access
to your surveillance.

00:06:47,131 --> 00:06:48,137
All of it.

00:06:49,138 --> 00:06:50,770
Thank you.

00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:51,871
BOOZELL:
Thank you!

00:06:53,773 --> 00:06:55,136
STOKES:
<i>Wait, no, no, no, no.</i>

00:06:55,136 --> 00:06:58,135
Pool's closed, ladies.

00:06:58,135 --> 00:07:00,138
Let's just go across
the street to Macklin's.

00:07:00,138 --> 00:07:01,614
We're losing sun.

00:07:04,137 --> 00:07:06,052
Last of the lookiloos?

00:07:06,052 --> 00:07:07,132
Yeah, yeah.

00:07:07,132 --> 00:07:08,136
Now it sounds
like everybody's

00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,023
going to the pool
across the street.

00:07:10,023 --> 00:07:11,824
Well, I just came from
the Eye in the Sky.

00:07:11,824 --> 00:07:13,660
I had security run
the outdoor cameras

00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,140
leading up to the
time of the attack.

00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:17,997
There are no signs of anyone
dropping a shark into the pool.

00:07:17,997 --> 00:07:19,732
But the cameras
inside the casino

00:07:19,732 --> 00:07:21,534
are a lot better
than out here.

00:07:21,534 --> 00:07:24,134
Half of this pool is
covered in a blind spot.

00:07:24,134 --> 00:07:26,131
Yeah, well, maybe somebody
knew that, you know?

00:07:26,131 --> 00:07:27,640
Maybe it's an
inside job.

00:07:29,676 --> 00:07:31,711
This is pretty
easy access.

00:07:31,711 --> 00:07:35,139
Back door leading from the
house right to the... pool.

00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:41,139
(camera clicks)

00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:48,027
I got to say,
it's a great place to get high.

00:07:48,027 --> 00:07:50,663
Yeah, not a bad place to
smuggle in a shark, either.

00:08:04,644 --> 00:08:05,645
(tapping glass)

00:08:08,135 --> 00:08:09,135
Hey, there.

00:08:09,135 --> 00:08:10,135
Hey.

00:08:10,135 --> 00:08:11,884
Welcome back.

00:08:11,884 --> 00:08:13,686
So how was Spokane?

00:08:13,686 --> 00:08:15,134
It was your niece,
wasn't it?

00:08:15,134 --> 00:08:16,756
It was Portland.

00:08:16,756 --> 00:08:18,558
It was my sister.

00:08:18,558 --> 00:08:20,135
And it was good.

00:08:20,135 --> 00:08:23,563
(cell phone vibrates)

00:08:23,563 --> 00:08:25,765
Oh, Catherine.

00:08:25,765 --> 00:08:28,735
I swear to God, all she does
is buzz me all day.

00:08:32,131 --> 00:08:34,131
I wanted to pick up

00:08:34,131 --> 00:08:35,139
where we left off.

00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:37,133
Okay.

00:08:37,133 --> 00:08:38,978
Dinner?

00:08:38,978 --> 00:08:41,131
I can't, I'm
really busy.

00:08:41,131 --> 00:08:44,484
But can we definitely
talk later?

00:08:44,484 --> 00:08:46,786
Sure, yeah, sure.
(phone vibrates)

00:08:46,786 --> 00:08:48,855
Oh, Catherine again.

00:08:49,889 --> 00:08:52,492
Uh, I got to go,

00:08:52,492 --> 00:08:54,134
but we'll talk later?

00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:55,762
Mm-hmm.

00:08:55,762 --> 00:08:58,132
Okay.

00:08:58,132 --> 00:09:01,868
Hey, Catherine, hello.

00:09:01,868 --> 00:09:03,669
Hey, yeah...

00:09:10,877 --> 00:09:12,912
I thought
I heard you coming.

00:09:12,912 --> 00:09:13,980
(sighs)

00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,448
Back on the rails.

00:09:15,448 --> 00:09:18,518
(chuckles)
Steady, thanks to you.

00:09:18,518 --> 00:09:20,920
Permission to come aboard.

00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,689
Permission granted,
Captain.

00:09:23,689 --> 00:09:24,891
This our girl?

00:09:24,891 --> 00:09:27,493
Desiree McQuire, 28.

00:09:27,493 --> 00:09:28,861
Arm's missing.

00:09:28,861 --> 00:09:30,530
Got a hunch where it went,

00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:34,138
but that is the Aquatic Vet's
purview, not mine.

00:09:34,138 --> 00:09:35,635
C.O.D. exsanguination?

00:09:35,635 --> 00:09:36,836
Seems obvious.

00:09:38,604 --> 00:09:40,873
Well, a shark tooth.

00:09:40,873 --> 00:09:43,075
Not a drop of blood on it.

00:09:45,945 --> 00:09:47,136
Clean as a whistle.

00:09:47,136 --> 00:09:49,131
No blood on the puncture.

00:09:49,131 --> 00:09:50,650
Tells me the tissue

00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:53,452
lacks vital response,
which means

00:09:53,452 --> 00:09:55,139
there was no blood flowing
through the tissue

00:09:55,139 --> 00:09:56,789
when she was bitten.

00:09:56,789 --> 00:09:58,991
According to David's report,
she bled out in the pool.

00:09:58,991 --> 00:10:01,727
Well, then,
blood had to be flowing.

00:10:01,727 --> 00:10:04,864
How can both things be true?

00:10:04,864 --> 00:10:06,966
BRASS:
<i>Been a while, Drops.</i>

00:10:06,966 --> 00:10:09,802
That's your ganja, man.
And that's enough

00:10:09,802 --> 00:10:12,004
to put you right back
in a ten-by-eight cell.

00:10:12,004 --> 00:10:13,472
Let me guess.

00:10:13,472 --> 00:10:16,042
One of your fancy
machines fingered me?

00:10:16,042 --> 00:10:18,678
Yeah, so, uh, what now?

00:10:18,678 --> 00:10:20,713
You guys going to
charge me with smoking?

00:10:20,713 --> 00:10:21,714
I like murder better.

00:10:21,714 --> 00:10:23,716
Murder?
Yeah.

00:10:23,716 --> 00:10:25,618
Nick, help me out here.

00:10:25,618 --> 00:10:27,053
Hey, don't look at me, man.

00:10:27,053 --> 00:10:29,132
I'm not the one
that got you in this mess.

00:10:29,132 --> 00:10:31,134
That blunt puts you
in the one blind spot

00:10:31,134 --> 00:10:32,758
where a shark
could have been put

00:10:32,758 --> 00:10:34,594
into the water, and according
to Human Resources,

00:10:34,594 --> 00:10:37,134
you had access
to the service area, which is

00:10:37,134 --> 00:10:38,139
right next
to the pool.

00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:40,533
BRASS:
A young woman was killed.

00:10:40,533 --> 00:10:42,140
That makes you
a co-conspirator.

00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,970
To a shark?

00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:45,671
Yeah.

00:10:45,671 --> 00:10:48,040
Man, you Columbos got this
all wrong.

00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,509
I promote Boozell's day clubs.

00:10:50,509 --> 00:10:52,139
That's why I have all access,

00:10:52,139 --> 00:10:55,047
and the area behind the pool
is where we bring in

00:10:55,047 --> 00:10:56,749
the DJ equipment.

00:10:56,749 --> 00:10:59,919
Do you guys have any idea

00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:02,655
how hard it is to get a job
when you get out the pen?

00:11:02,655 --> 00:11:04,857
Boozell took a chance on me

00:11:04,857 --> 00:11:07,059
after I was laid off
from my first gig.

00:11:07,059 --> 00:11:08,594
Why would I blow that?

00:11:08,594 --> 00:11:10,132
The job or the blunt?

00:11:10,132 --> 00:11:13,032
Come on, now, got a wife
and kid to support.

00:11:13,032 --> 00:11:15,139
And it's not like Macklin's
going to take me back.

00:11:15,139 --> 00:11:18,070
You used to work across
the street at Macklin's?

00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:19,572
I used to promote his day clubs.

00:11:19,572 --> 00:11:22,708
I mean, until I got fired
for nothing.

00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:25,711
Okay, Macklin's got
an aquarium, sharks

00:11:25,711 --> 00:11:27,140
and a day club
that would benefit

00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:29,137
from Boozell's
bad luck.
Wait a minute.

00:11:29,137 --> 00:11:33,519
So you think that I put
that shark in that pool

00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,134
for a guy who fired me?

00:11:35,134 --> 00:11:36,756
No, but you and I

00:11:36,756 --> 00:11:39,692
both know that if the price is
right, you'd look the other way.

00:11:39,692 --> 00:11:42,929
I mean, you do have a wife and a
kid to support. You said it.

00:11:42,929 --> 00:11:47,500
And if there's one guy who just
can't stay out of jail...

00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,768
it's you.

00:11:50,803 --> 00:11:52,638
BOOZELL:
<i>Why would this Drops kid</i>

00:11:52,638 --> 00:11:54,440
bite the hand that feeds him?

00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,943
I gave him a job right after
Macklin threw him out.

00:11:56,943 --> 00:11:59,135
And my day club
went through the roof.

00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:02,782
I'm not one for puns, but
it sounds like you're fishing.

00:12:02,782 --> 00:12:05,584
Maybe I am testing
the waters a bit,

00:12:05,584 --> 00:12:09,137
trying to get
a little background.

00:12:09,137 --> 00:12:11,524
Let's be cards up on this.

00:12:11,524 --> 00:12:13,893
Your daddy used to say that.

00:12:13,893 --> 00:12:15,528
The rivalry between
you and Macklin--

00:12:15,528 --> 00:12:18,731
to insiders like me,
is a bedtime story.

00:12:18,731 --> 00:12:21,534
I know all about Macklin's
signature property,

00:12:21,534 --> 00:12:22,868
the Big Dragon going off,

00:12:22,868 --> 00:12:24,132
rattling the windows
of your casino,

00:12:24,132 --> 00:12:25,671
and you barging into
his office,

00:12:25,671 --> 00:12:27,840
demanding that he turn it down.

00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,976
And what did he do?
He made it even louder.

00:12:29,976 --> 00:12:33,679
So, when Macklin built
his topless Euro pool,

00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:35,014
you put up a tower

00:12:35,014 --> 00:12:37,450
that blocked all of
his customers' sun.

00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:39,138
What's the problem?

00:12:39,138 --> 00:12:40,886
You both have day clubs,

00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:44,090
pools, sharks,
and a rivalry that goes back

00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:46,133
to when Bugsy set foot
in the desert.

00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:48,661
You don't think I put
the shark in my own pool?

00:12:48,661 --> 00:12:50,135
That doesn't
make sense.

00:12:50,135 --> 00:12:51,797
You know the
financials.

00:12:51,797 --> 00:12:54,734
They just w-walk
across the street.

00:12:56,836 --> 00:12:58,704
Macklin.

00:12:58,704 --> 00:13:00,133
I'm gonna kill him.

00:13:00,133 --> 00:13:02,475
Bit of free advice.

00:13:02,475 --> 00:13:04,477
Never say that
in front of a cop.

00:13:06,138 --> 00:13:09,015
Shark bites a woman's arm off,
severs the brachial artery.

00:13:09,015 --> 00:13:10,135
What happens?

00:13:10,135 --> 00:13:12,551
She's going to bleed out
into the pool, period.

00:13:12,551 --> 00:13:14,136
Which leads us
back to the tooth,

00:13:14,136 --> 00:13:17,456
which shows no evidence of
inflammation or any hemorrhaging

00:13:17,456 --> 00:13:19,558
in the surrounding soft tissue
where you found it.

00:13:19,558 --> 00:13:21,761
Which could only mean
she was dead

00:13:21,761 --> 00:13:23,139
before the shark
ever took a bite.

00:13:23,139 --> 00:13:25,598
All right, so if she was dead
before she was bitten,

00:13:25,598 --> 00:13:27,533
a shark bites
a dead woman's arm off,

00:13:27,533 --> 00:13:28,834
severs an artery.
What happens?

00:13:28,834 --> 00:13:30,703
She's going to bleed out
into the pool.

00:13:30,703 --> 00:13:32,140
Why? Because the artery's
like a pipe;

00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,773
the blood's got to go somewhere.

00:13:33,773 --> 00:13:36,776
Okay, okay,
both things are true.

00:13:36,776 --> 00:13:39,135
Our victim did not die
of a shark attack.

00:13:39,135 --> 00:13:44,134
We are still looking for C.O.D.

00:13:44,134 --> 00:13:46,138
Any other signs of trauma
on the body?

00:13:46,138 --> 00:13:48,554
Not on the front.

00:13:48,554 --> 00:13:50,923
I guess we're gonna
have to flip her.

00:13:50,923 --> 00:13:53,140
All righty.

00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:56,729
(grunting)

00:13:58,764 --> 00:14:00,699
(stifled chuckling)

00:14:00,699 --> 00:14:02,768
All right.

00:14:12,139 --> 00:14:14,132
ROBBINS:
Oh, injection mark.

00:14:14,132 --> 00:14:16,137
Looks like
a large-gauge needle.

00:14:16,137 --> 00:14:17,950
It would be impossible
to inject yourself

00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:19,752
in the middle of
your back like this.

00:14:21,654 --> 00:14:24,137
What color was the raft?

00:14:24,137 --> 00:14:26,525
Catherine said coral.

00:14:26,525 --> 00:14:28,928
Coral it is.

00:14:29,929 --> 00:14:31,597
♪ ♪

00:14:34,533 --> 00:14:37,134
<i>According toSharkWeek,</i>
<i>it only takes</i>

00:14:37,134 --> 00:14:38,871
a drop of blood
to attract a shark

00:14:38,871 --> 00:14:39,939
from a hundred miles away.

00:14:39,939 --> 00:14:41,131
Which would explain

00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:43,442
why Desiree was singled out
by the shark.

00:14:44,643 --> 00:14:46,712
(screaming)

00:14:46,712 --> 00:14:49,448
That means the shark is only
guilty of biting a dead woman.

00:14:49,448 --> 00:14:51,083
Our killer's still out there.

00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:00,059
Dr. Ray, it's good
to have you back.

00:15:00,059 --> 00:15:01,560
Good to be back, Henry.

00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,139
Got C.O.D. on
your shark victim.

00:15:03,139 --> 00:15:04,730
You were right.

00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:06,133
Acute opiate toxicity.

00:15:06,133 --> 00:15:07,666
It was a heroin
overdose.

00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:10,069
Based on metabolites, she
was a first-time user.

00:15:10,069 --> 00:15:12,838
So her first dose
was also her last.
Mm-hmm.

00:15:12,838 --> 00:15:14,137
STOKES:
Well, there's obviously

00:15:14,137 --> 00:15:15,908
a ton of people
in the pool,

00:15:15,908 --> 00:15:18,137
and all the angles
are terrible.

00:15:18,137 --> 00:15:19,912
I do have some shots
of Desiree,

00:15:19,912 --> 00:15:22,815
but from the time she got on
the raft until she was attacked,

00:15:22,815 --> 00:15:25,684
there's no clear shots
of Desiree or her killer.

00:15:25,684 --> 00:15:27,052
She's wearing
an awful lot of bling

00:15:27,052 --> 00:15:28,133
to be hanging by the pool.

00:15:28,133 --> 00:15:29,755
Yeah, right?

00:15:34,627 --> 00:15:36,996
Yeah, hang on a second.

00:15:40,131 --> 00:15:42,535
She rolls into the pool
looking like Paris Hilton,

00:15:42,535 --> 00:15:45,131
but when she comes out,
she's lost her life

00:15:45,131 --> 00:15:46,438
and all her jewelry.

00:15:46,438 --> 00:15:48,507
Her arm was
devoured by a shark,

00:15:48,507 --> 00:15:51,010
which means she was
thrashed about a bit.

00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:54,813
So maybe the rest of her jewelry
is at the bottom of the pool.

00:15:55,848 --> 00:15:58,684
You and Wendy talk?

00:15:58,684 --> 00:16:01,921
Yeah, we talk all the time.

00:16:01,921 --> 00:16:02,922
Why?

00:16:02,922 --> 00:16:05,139
You talk to Wendy?

00:16:05,139 --> 00:16:08,928
It's more like
she talks to me.

00:16:08,928 --> 00:16:10,462
It's not that serious.

00:16:10,462 --> 00:16:12,531
She comes to me, we talk.

00:16:12,531 --> 00:16:14,137
You know, friends.

00:16:14,137 --> 00:16:15,139
W-Wait.

00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:17,139
W-What kind of friends?

00:16:17,139 --> 00:16:19,572
Friend friends
or friends with benefits?

00:16:19,572 --> 00:16:21,974
Well, define "benefits."

00:16:24,677 --> 00:16:26,131
Um...

00:16:26,131 --> 00:16:29,048
I'll load up
and meet you out front.

00:16:37,523 --> 00:16:39,725
Is this the "talk later" part?

00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,528
Yeah.

00:16:42,528 --> 00:16:44,997
Is it about Henry?

00:16:48,867 --> 00:16:49,868
No.

00:16:51,904 --> 00:16:53,739
Is it about me?

00:16:55,138 --> 00:16:56,942
It's about you and me.

00:17:01,914 --> 00:17:04,850
I got a new job.

00:17:06,885 --> 00:17:07,886
(chuckles softly)

00:17:07,886 --> 00:17:09,131
That's great.

00:17:09,131 --> 00:17:12,091
What, they gonna send you
out in the field, or...?

00:17:12,091 --> 00:17:14,727
It's in Portland
with my sister.

00:17:14,727 --> 00:17:18,137
Not in Spokane
with my niece.

00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:20,137
And I get to be
a field mouse.

00:17:22,534 --> 00:17:24,134
Not a lab rat.

00:17:24,134 --> 00:17:26,071
Wow.

00:17:26,071 --> 00:17:27,806
(chuckles)

00:17:27,806 --> 00:17:29,135
Congratulations.

00:17:29,135 --> 00:17:32,139
Thank you.

00:17:32,139 --> 00:17:35,814
(voice breaking): Does anybody
else know about this?

00:17:35,814 --> 00:17:37,883
Um, yeah.

00:17:37,883 --> 00:17:40,085
Yeah, Catherine
was nice enough

00:17:40,085 --> 00:17:41,754
to make a couple
phone calls for me.

00:17:41,754 --> 00:17:44,133
And, um, Henry--

00:17:44,133 --> 00:17:47,140
he gave me
some advice.

00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:50,696
I'm leaving, Hodges.

00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,699
Yeah.

00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:56,035
And I'm the last to know.

00:17:56,035 --> 00:17:57,836
Yeah, you're the last to know.

00:17:57,836 --> 00:18:00,139
Because I wanted it that way.

00:18:00,139 --> 00:18:02,138
Because I knew that
if I told you sooner,

00:18:02,138 --> 00:18:05,077
you would get really upset,
and then you'd blame Henry,

00:18:05,077 --> 00:18:08,981
and you'd try to get me to stay.

00:18:08,981 --> 00:18:11,134
And I can't.

00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:16,136
Wendy...

00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:18,857
(sniffles)

00:18:25,998 --> 00:18:27,866
(sniffles)

00:18:27,866 --> 00:18:28,901
Good-bye.

00:18:28,901 --> 00:18:31,139
D-Don't.

00:18:40,137 --> 00:18:42,448
WOMAN (over P.A.):
<i>Mr. Macklin,</i>

00:18:42,448 --> 00:18:44,550
Mr. Danny Macklin,
please pick up

00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:47,139
the nearest
white courtesy phone.

00:18:47,139 --> 00:18:50,135
This is Macklin.

00:18:50,135 --> 00:18:53,139
I see.

00:18:53,139 --> 00:18:55,461
Strawberry blond,
all business.

00:18:55,461 --> 00:18:58,063
I think I found her.

00:18:58,063 --> 00:18:59,798
Still paging?

00:18:59,798 --> 00:19:01,600
Now, that's old school.

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,503
I consider myself new school,
but paging is vintage Vegas.

00:19:04,503 --> 00:19:05,938
Danny Macklin.

00:19:05,938 --> 00:19:08,674
Catherine Willows, CSI.

00:19:08,674 --> 00:19:10,642
Please.

00:19:10,642 --> 00:19:13,011
CSI, huh?

00:19:13,011 --> 00:19:14,980
Let me guess.

00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:17,015
The Booze couldn't keep
the sharks in his tank,

00:19:17,015 --> 00:19:18,550
and now he's blaming me.

00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:19,885
Well, as you know, Mr. Macklin,

00:19:19,885 --> 00:19:21,553
day clubs are
the hottest ticket in town,

00:19:21,553 --> 00:19:24,456
unless of course,
you have a shark-infested pool.

00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:27,137
And I know that you have
a stable of sharks.

00:19:27,137 --> 00:19:29,795
Would you like to
count my sharks?

00:19:29,795 --> 00:19:32,137
Because I can tell you that
if there's a shark missing,

00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:33,532
I'd be the first to know.

00:19:33,532 --> 00:19:34,967
Yes, but would you tell me?

00:19:34,967 --> 00:19:37,603
You know, I wouldn't
put it past the Booze

00:19:37,603 --> 00:19:40,939
to drop a shark in his own pool
and try to finger me for it.

00:19:40,939 --> 00:19:43,008
Not exactly the smartest ace
in the deck.

00:19:43,008 --> 00:19:44,132
More of a joker, actually.

00:19:44,132 --> 00:19:46,512
Well, joke's on him,

00:19:46,512 --> 00:19:49,948
because his dollars are walking
right through my front door.

00:19:49,948 --> 00:19:51,850
Which makes you
the prime suspect.

00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:54,720
That's enough business.

00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,055
Why don't, um, why don't
we get some lunch, huh?

00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,624
We got a great
shark fin soup here.

00:19:58,624 --> 00:20:00,138
Can I order you some?

00:20:00,138 --> 00:20:01,660
That's one of
the biggest reasons

00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,132
sharks are becoming extinct.

00:20:04,963 --> 00:20:06,498
I'll pass.

00:20:06,498 --> 00:20:09,968
Thanks for your time,
Mr. Macklin.

00:20:12,004 --> 00:20:13,739
HODGES:
How long did you know?

00:20:13,739 --> 00:20:15,138
ANDREWS:
Know what?

00:20:15,138 --> 00:20:18,137
Wendy was leaving.

00:20:18,137 --> 00:20:20,138
She asked my opinion
a couple months ago;

00:20:20,138 --> 00:20:22,915
I told her it was a
great opportunity.

00:20:22,915 --> 00:20:24,950
So, basically,
you pushed her out the door.

00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:27,986
You going to Portland, too,
Mr. Friends With Benefits?

00:20:27,986 --> 00:20:29,140
Look, Hodges, as
much as you think

00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,989
it's a one-way street,
it wasn't, all right?

00:20:30,989 --> 00:20:32,558
I can't help that
she comes to me

00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:34,134
'cause she can't
talk to you.

00:20:34,134 --> 00:20:35,994
Henry, you might
want to shut up now.

00:20:35,994 --> 00:20:37,729
Seriously, you're
gonna blame me?

00:20:37,729 --> 00:20:39,134
Dude, you're the one
that couldn't close.

00:20:39,134 --> 00:20:41,135
Henry.
No, you took her out
for coffee, right?

00:20:41,135 --> 00:20:44,133
And then you can't take her
home, 'cause you live at home.

00:20:44,133 --> 00:20:45,704
What are you going
to tell your Mom,

00:20:45,704 --> 00:20:46,872
"take a ride around the block"?

00:20:46,872 --> 00:20:48,974
That's it!

00:20:50,132 --> 00:20:52,444
This is all your fault!
What are you doing?

00:20:58,134 --> 00:21:00,132
Henry?

00:21:00,132 --> 00:21:02,137
Henry?

00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:05,138
Henry!

00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:08,138
(gasping)

00:21:08,138 --> 00:21:09,862
I found the murder weapon.

00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,899
Good eyes.

Run this through tox.

00:22:05,131 --> 00:22:07,138
I want to make sure
it's the same needle

00:22:07,138 --> 00:22:09,087
that injected heroin
into our victim.

00:22:09,087 --> 00:22:11,140
Okay. As long as you keep
Hodges away from me.

00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:13,659
I think I got
swimmer's ear.

00:22:13,659 --> 00:22:15,139
Hmm?

00:22:15,139 --> 00:22:17,729

Hey, Jim, it's Nick.

00:22:30,132 --> 00:22:34,012
We need to pick up a woman--
Anya Sanchez, FHA.

00:22:34,012 --> 00:22:38,050
Last known address:
27321 Barlow.

00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:39,818
She's got quite a rap sheet.

00:22:39,818 --> 00:22:41,853
I think this may be our girl.

00:22:43,133 --> 00:22:44,990
Come on. That's Cartier.

00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:46,138
BRASS:
No, no, no, no.

00:22:46,138 --> 00:22:47,826
That's robbery.

00:22:47,826 --> 00:22:50,133
And this is
your second strike, right?

00:22:50,133 --> 00:22:52,531
I mean, that's...
that's quite a pile.

00:22:52,531 --> 00:22:54,533
Looks like there's
a few strikes in there.

00:22:54,533 --> 00:22:56,135
Then again, all we need
is three, right?

00:22:56,135 --> 00:22:57,669
Come on, you guys.

00:22:57,669 --> 00:22:59,136
Come on.

00:22:59,136 --> 00:23:01,506
I know this game, all right?

00:23:01,506 --> 00:23:03,442
You bring me in here.

00:23:03,442 --> 00:23:04,710
You lean on me.

00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:06,445
You try to get
me to plea.

00:23:06,445 --> 00:23:08,614
You like that?

00:23:08,614 --> 00:23:10,449
You got a Patek Philippe?
I don't know.

00:23:10,449 --> 00:23:11,750
Check.

00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,652
You want to keep that?

00:23:13,652 --> 00:23:15,921
Sure.

00:23:15,921 --> 00:23:18,138
How about you take a bracelet
for your little girlfriend?

00:23:18,138 --> 00:23:19,992
I got a girlfriend, too.

00:23:19,992 --> 00:23:21,526
Be my guest.

00:23:21,526 --> 00:23:23,134
Okay.

00:23:23,134 --> 00:23:25,530
It's not that easy.

00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:27,134
It could be, really.

00:23:27,134 --> 00:23:28,533
STOKES:
I don't think
you realize

00:23:28,533 --> 00:23:30,002
how much trouble
you're in.

00:23:30,002 --> 00:23:31,503
Do you recognize...

00:23:31,503 --> 00:23:32,738
this girl?

00:23:32,738 --> 00:23:35,131
Her name's Desiree McQuire.

00:23:35,131 --> 00:23:37,131
I mean, you should.

00:23:37,131 --> 00:23:38,777
You're in possession
of her necklace, her rings...

00:23:38,777 --> 00:23:40,779
and I think these
are her bracelets.

00:23:40,779 --> 00:23:43,140
And I'm going to go out
on a limb here and...

00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,136
those gold hoop
earrings--

00:23:45,136 --> 00:23:46,752
those are hers, too.

00:23:48,131 --> 00:23:50,131
Okay.

00:23:51,823 --> 00:23:54,059
Okay.

00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:56,695
Yeah, yeah,
I've been a bad girl.

00:23:57,863 --> 00:23:59,136
I admit I got
sticky fingers

00:23:59,136 --> 00:24:01,800
sometimes, so...

00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,670
print me, book me,
whatever it is.

00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:06,138
I'm just going to post bail

00:24:06,138 --> 00:24:08,137
and take a few days
off work, so...

00:24:08,137 --> 00:24:10,008
You'll need more
than a couple days.

00:24:10,008 --> 00:24:12,134
I know how you robbed her.

00:24:13,812 --> 00:24:15,614
You injected her
with heroin.

00:24:15,614 --> 00:24:18,138
When she was knocked out,
you picked her clean.

00:24:18,138 --> 00:24:19,985
The tough spot is,

00:24:19,985 --> 00:24:21,586
your fingerprint
was on the syringe.

00:24:21,586 --> 00:24:23,131
And let me guess.

00:24:23,131 --> 00:24:25,757
That was a new batch
of heroin, right?

00:24:25,757 --> 00:24:27,726
Well, you know...

00:24:27,726 --> 00:24:31,137
the weekend cleaned me out,
so I had to improvise.

00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:34,833
So I got it from a new seller,
but I didn't sell it,

00:24:34,833 --> 00:24:37,703
so... it's just robbery.

00:24:41,673 --> 00:24:43,942
Right?

00:24:43,942 --> 00:24:47,746
No. No, unfortunately,
Miss McQuire died--

00:24:47,746 --> 00:24:49,815
of a heroin overdose.

00:24:49,815 --> 00:24:51,516
It's felony murder.

00:24:51,516 --> 00:24:53,685
BRASS:
You gave her
a hot shot,

00:24:53,685 --> 00:24:55,754
hotshot.

00:24:55,754 --> 00:24:58,133
You're right.

00:24:58,133 --> 00:25:00,135
You've been a bad girl.

STOKES:
<i>Brass ran Anya Sanchez's</i>
<i>credit cards.</i>

00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,467
<i>She's been renting out cabanas</i>

00:25:08,467 --> 00:25:10,132
at every pool party
in town.

00:25:10,132 --> 00:25:12,003
She had quite an attitude
till she realized

00:25:12,003 --> 00:25:13,139
she'd gone from thief
to murderer,

00:25:13,139 --> 00:25:14,840
but I don't think
she had anything

00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,132
to do with our
shark attack.

00:25:16,132 --> 00:25:17,136
Two separate events.

00:25:17,136 --> 00:25:18,577
Yeah, sounds like it.

00:25:18,577 --> 00:25:20,135
So we're still
chasing the idiot

00:25:20,135 --> 00:25:22,080
who put the shark
in the water.

00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,650
Which is attempted murder
on everyone in Boozell's pool.

00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:27,085
HOLLOWAY: All right,
based on her condition,

00:25:27,085 --> 00:25:28,687
I'd say she's a young one.

00:25:28,687 --> 00:25:30,135
No more than five or six.

00:25:30,135 --> 00:25:32,140
Under normal
circumstances,

00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:34,140
not exposed to the pool's
filtration system,

00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:36,137
she could have lived
another 30 years.

00:25:36,137 --> 00:25:37,763
Doctor, care to do the honors?

00:25:37,763 --> 00:25:39,631
Why not?

00:25:44,636 --> 00:25:46,605
(grunting)

00:25:49,841 --> 00:25:51,140
Dr. Langston.

00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,644
Thank you.

00:25:57,649 --> 00:25:59,084
(grunting)

00:25:59,084 --> 00:26:01,140
That's... that's better.

00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:04,523
See if you can get
those spreaders in there.

00:26:09,761 --> 00:26:11,563
Okay.

00:26:11,563 --> 00:26:12,931
That is one huge gut.

00:26:12,931 --> 00:26:14,733
She is an eating machine.

00:26:23,134 --> 00:26:24,139
All right.

00:26:24,139 --> 00:26:26,137
You mind if I
take a look?

00:26:26,137 --> 00:26:27,140
Be my guest.

00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:29,881
All right, let's see
what we got.

00:26:29,881 --> 00:26:32,851
Now, this shark
is definitely from the wild.

00:26:32,851 --> 00:26:35,687
You can tell by the
species she was eating.

00:26:35,687 --> 00:26:38,089
You got mackerel...
(grunts)

00:26:38,089 --> 00:26:39,724
Here we go. Excuse me.

00:26:39,724 --> 00:26:41,059
And some eel.

00:26:42,594 --> 00:26:44,496
A little squid.

00:26:45,597 --> 00:26:48,600
Ah. Got, uh,
even some baby shark.

00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,136
Zebra, blacktip.

00:26:51,136 --> 00:26:53,705
Found off the Florida Keys.

00:26:53,705 --> 00:26:56,139
What I cannot tell you
is how she got here.

00:26:56,139 --> 00:26:57,776
There are
collectors

00:26:57,776 --> 00:27:00,679
who capture sharks
out of the ocean.

00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:02,547
They're legit
if they have permits.

00:27:02,547 --> 00:27:05,133
But the sharks
are almost impossible to track.

00:27:05,133 --> 00:27:07,133
Well, thank you, Dr. Holloway.

00:27:07,133 --> 00:27:08,753
You've been very helpful.

00:27:08,753 --> 00:27:10,689
Gentlemen.

00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:13,131
(door opening)

00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:15,131
Helpful?
(door closes)

00:27:15,131 --> 00:27:17,095
He's not a<i>Shark</i>Weekwatcher.

00:27:17,095 --> 00:27:19,132
Most aquariums
get their sharks

00:27:19,132 --> 00:27:20,999
from captive
breeding programs.

00:27:20,999 --> 00:27:22,801
Right.

00:27:25,136 --> 00:27:26,140
Hmm.

00:27:27,706 --> 00:27:30,809
Where does a wild shark
get freshly-cut pieces of fish?

00:27:30,809 --> 00:27:32,844
The doctor's a liar.

00:27:32,844 --> 00:27:36,481
You know, I've taken the
tour at Mandalay Bay.

00:27:36,481 --> 00:27:38,884
You know, the one with
the audio guide to your ear.

00:27:38,884 --> 00:27:40,619
I hate those things.
I love them.

00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:42,754
You learn stuff.
Sharks in captivity

00:27:42,754 --> 00:27:43,889
have to be tagged.

00:27:43,889 --> 00:27:46,591
It's like bringing a DB
into autopsy

00:27:46,591 --> 00:27:48,493
without a toe tag.
I am telling you--

00:27:48,493 --> 00:27:51,730
this shark was shark-napped
out of some casino.

00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:54,133
I believe you, Doc.

00:28:01,072 --> 00:28:03,541
You ever known shark
skin to be smooth?

00:28:03,541 --> 00:28:05,477
Feel that--
right there.

00:28:05,477 --> 00:28:06,811
Hmm.

00:28:06,811 --> 00:28:09,132
It's almost as if it
was sanded down.

00:28:09,132 --> 00:28:11,816
Well, if you can do it
with the VIN number of a car,

00:28:11,816 --> 00:28:13,132
why not a shark?

00:28:37,138 --> 00:28:40,133
LANGSTON:
<i>Genus:Galeocerdo.</i>

00:28:40,133 --> 00:28:43,048
Species:<i>cuvier.</i>

00:28:43,048 --> 00:28:45,138
<i>Galeocerdo</i>
<i>cuvier--GC.</i>

00:28:45,138 --> 00:28:47,986
So the first two
letters of the I.D.

00:28:47,986 --> 00:28:49,135
are genus
and species.

00:28:49,135 --> 00:28:51,690
Right.
The next two numbers denote

00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:53,925
the year that the shark
was purchased.

00:28:53,925 --> 00:28:55,694
One zero
means 2010.

00:28:55,694 --> 00:28:59,030
And zero three means it
was the third tiger shark

00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:01,134
purchased for that
particular aquarium.

00:29:01,134 --> 00:29:03,131
And there are only a handful

00:29:03,131 --> 00:29:06,604
of aquariums in Vegas
that have sharks.

00:29:06,604 --> 00:29:09,874
I've got the
list right here.

00:29:09,874 --> 00:29:13,611
And I think I know who I'm
going to talk to first.

00:29:13,611 --> 00:29:16,132
LANGSTON
Well, Mr. Macklin,

00:29:16,132 --> 00:29:19,132
that is your shark.

00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:23,137
At least, it was your shark
until it took a dip

00:29:23,137 --> 00:29:25,557
in Mr. Boozell's pool.

00:29:25,557 --> 00:29:26,992
WILLOWS:
And, Mr. Macklin,

00:29:26,992 --> 00:29:29,594
let me remind you
of your own words.

00:29:29,594 --> 00:29:32,597
"If there's a shark
missing from my property,

00:29:32,597 --> 00:29:34,138
I'd be the
first to know."

00:29:36,001 --> 00:29:37,535
Here's the thing.

00:29:37,535 --> 00:29:42,131
As of, uh, yesterday,
I'm not missing a shark.

00:29:42,131 --> 00:29:45,710
But, last week, I had a shark
with a tapeworm.

00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:46,878
Excuse me?

00:29:46,878 --> 00:29:48,137
Yeah, I got a $50,000 shark

00:29:48,137 --> 00:29:49,981
that's eating me
out of house and home,

00:29:49,981 --> 00:29:51,583
eating all my baby sharks.

00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:53,135
(stammers)
Do you know how much it costs

00:29:53,135 --> 00:29:54,986
to ship a zebra
or blacktip to Vegas?

00:29:54,986 --> 00:29:55,987
How much?

00:29:55,987 --> 00:29:58,135
15 grand a fish. Yeah.

00:29:58,135 --> 00:30:01,826
And this tiger shark is eating
them up like potato chips.

00:30:01,826 --> 00:30:04,136
See, my goal
on my property

00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:05,764
is to provide
a tranquil aquarium

00:30:05,764 --> 00:30:07,140
for my guests as they check in.

00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:10,702
And instead, I've got
a 200-pound eating machine

00:30:10,702 --> 00:30:12,470
that's tearing up my tank

00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:14,806
before my guests can even get
their freaking key cards.

00:30:14,806 --> 00:30:17,075
So I, uh,
checked the shark out early.

00:30:17,075 --> 00:30:18,140
I got rid of it.

00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:20,578
How did you get rid of it?
I called my guy--

00:30:20,578 --> 00:30:22,447
the guy who takes care
of my fish. Um... Aquavet.

00:30:22,447 --> 00:30:24,132
Dr. Holloway.

00:30:24,132 --> 00:30:25,583
He handles all
the properties.

00:30:25,583 --> 00:30:26,918
He came by, picked it up.

00:30:26,918 --> 00:30:29,487
Oh, and, uh,
speaking of my words,

00:30:29,487 --> 00:30:32,131
it went a little something
like this--

00:30:32,131 --> 00:30:35,093
"You get that disposal
with a fin off my property,

00:30:35,093 --> 00:30:37,095
before I turn it
into a buffet special."

00:30:37,095 --> 00:30:39,139
I got something to say!
You think I don't know

00:30:39,139 --> 00:30:40,899
cops with cell phones?
You gotta be kidding me!

00:30:40,899 --> 00:30:43,132
Who do you think dimed you out
to let me know you're here?

00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:45,131
I'm on to you, Macklin.
Yeah, I want a piece of you.
You feelin' tough?!

00:30:45,131 --> 00:30:46,671
You want a piece of me? Okay...

00:30:46,671 --> 00:30:48,473
You want too far this
time with that shark.
You just keep talking.

00:30:48,473 --> 00:30:50,132
You crossed the line.
It's all going on record.
You keep talking.

00:30:50,132 --> 00:30:51,139
Gentlemen!
(shouting stops)

00:30:51,139 --> 00:30:52,710
This interview's over.

00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:54,779
Escort them out of here.

00:30:54,779 --> 00:30:57,136
Come on, let's go.

00:31:05,132 --> 00:31:07,826
Talk about
shark-infested waters.

00:31:25,844 --> 00:31:28,880
Bring it back when you
take the boot off.

00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:33,852
Send a stretch.

00:31:35,453 --> 00:31:37,522
STOKES:
<i>Yeah, Catherine, we got a bead</i>
<i>on Dr. Holloway.</i>

00:31:37,522 --> 00:31:39,657
His office said he's working
at Macklin's property,

00:31:39,657 --> 00:31:41,926
but we can't seem
to get him on the phone,

00:31:41,926 --> 00:31:43,628
so he must be
in the water.

00:31:43,628 --> 00:31:46,138
We'll call you as soon as we
find out something else.

00:31:46,138 --> 00:31:47,732
BOY:
There you are.

00:31:47,732 --> 00:31:49,133
Mom, Mom, I got it.

00:31:49,133 --> 00:31:50,535
It's so cool.

00:31:50,535 --> 00:31:52,138
I got a great picture!
Come on!

00:31:52,138 --> 00:31:55,131
Awfully fired up about taking
a picture of a fish.

00:31:55,131 --> 00:31:58,133
Well, you know,
fish are beautiful.

00:31:58,133 --> 00:32:00,612
Not when you're sleeping
with them.

00:32:00,612 --> 00:32:02,514
SIDLE:
It's Dr. Holloway.

00:32:02,514 --> 00:32:04,449
Well, that explains
why his cell phone

00:32:04,449 --> 00:32:05,984
went straight
to voice mail.

00:32:18,696 --> 00:32:20,138
First blush?

00:32:20,138 --> 00:32:22,000
Pink.

00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,535
What caused it?

00:32:23,535 --> 00:32:26,504
Could be carbon dioxide,

00:32:26,504 --> 00:32:29,073
carbon monoxide, cyanide.

00:32:29,073 --> 00:32:31,576
Dealer's choice, pal.

00:32:46,824 --> 00:32:48,993
Hey. Where do you want this?

00:32:48,993 --> 00:32:50,728
Why don't you
put it in my mouth

00:32:50,728 --> 00:32:52,139
and shoot it
with a high-powered rifle?

00:32:52,139 --> 00:32:53,631
No way, man.

00:32:53,631 --> 00:32:55,633
Last thing I need's
another explosion.

00:32:55,633 --> 00:32:57,139
I'm just starting
to get my hearing back.

00:32:57,139 --> 00:32:58,803
I got to buck up.

00:32:58,803 --> 00:33:01,639
I got to get my shark face on.

00:33:01,639 --> 00:33:03,007
Get tough.

00:33:03,007 --> 00:33:05,136
Good. You know, I have
a tough job for a tough guy.

00:33:05,136 --> 00:33:06,444
Excellent.

00:33:06,444 --> 00:33:08,813
I need
to keep my mind off Wendy.

00:33:08,813 --> 00:33:10,133
Okay, test the contents

00:33:10,133 --> 00:33:11,849
of the tank with quants, please.

00:33:11,849 --> 00:33:14,132
Want to give me a heads up, let
me know what I'm looking for?

00:33:14,132 --> 00:33:16,140
Whatever turned our suspect
into the Pink Panther.

00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:18,022
Mmm.

00:33:18,022 --> 00:33:20,133
Hey. Hey.

00:33:23,528 --> 00:33:25,136
♪ ♪

00:33:36,132 --> 00:33:38,910
(gas hissing)

00:33:45,139 --> 00:33:46,451
(valve closes)

00:34:00,632 --> 00:34:02,567
I found the pink culprit:

00:34:02,567 --> 00:34:04,132
it's CO poisoning;

00:34:04,132 --> 00:34:05,470
carbon monoxide.

00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:08,006
Someone tampered
with Holloway's scuba tank.

00:34:08,006 --> 00:34:09,137
HODGES:
I can tell you how.

00:34:09,137 --> 00:34:11,134
Also found hydrocarbons
and nitrous oxides.

00:34:11,134 --> 00:34:14,137
Both are by-products of an
internal combustion engine.

00:34:14,137 --> 00:34:16,781
You're saying somebody filled
his scuba tank

00:34:16,781 --> 00:34:18,483
with car exhaust?

00:34:18,483 --> 00:34:20,133
Well, it's not
that hard really.

00:34:20,133 --> 00:34:21,586
You just take
the compressor intake,

00:34:21,586 --> 00:34:23,788
put it next to the exhaust,
and you're in business.

00:34:23,788 --> 00:34:26,991
Even one percent of carbon
monoxide can kill you.

00:34:26,991 --> 00:34:29,661
It binds 200 times tighter
to hemoglobin than oxygen,

00:34:29,661 --> 00:34:31,137
preventing the O2
from being distributed

00:34:31,137 --> 00:34:32,797
and absorbed by the body.

00:34:32,797 --> 00:34:34,565
And you suffocate.

00:34:34,565 --> 00:34:35,867
Yeah, and you turn pink.

00:34:35,867 --> 00:34:38,137
WILLOWS: We know that
it was Macklin's shark

00:34:38,137 --> 00:34:40,132
that ended up in
Boozell's pool.

00:34:40,132 --> 00:34:42,139
Probably put there
by Dr. Holloway,

00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:44,138
who worked for both
Macklin and Boozell.

00:34:44,138 --> 00:34:47,912
So, who stood to gain more by
the doctor's untimely death,

00:34:47,912 --> 00:34:50,948
the Booze or the Mack?

00:34:50,948 --> 00:34:52,583
Let's run both scenarios.
I'm the Mack.

00:34:52,583 --> 00:34:54,140
I call up the Aquavet
and I say,

00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:56,139
"Hey, man, you wanna make
a little extra cash?

00:34:56,139 --> 00:34:59,524
"Sand the number off the
reject shark from my tank,

00:34:59,524 --> 00:35:00,658
"throw it in Boozell's pool

00:35:00,658 --> 00:35:02,560
"so I that I can steal
all his customers.

00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,895
Only don't tell the cops."

00:35:03,895 --> 00:35:04,896
Oops.

00:35:04,896 --> 00:35:07,498
Or I'm the Booze,

00:35:07,498 --> 00:35:09,136
and I call the Aquavet
and I say,

00:35:09,136 --> 00:35:10,968
"Hey, I know Macklin paid you

00:35:10,968 --> 00:35:13,671
"to put that shark into my pool
to ruin me.

00:35:13,671 --> 00:35:15,133
You're a dead man."

00:35:15,133 --> 00:35:16,135
Who's got better motive?

00:35:16,135 --> 00:35:17,775
We let the evidence decide.

00:35:17,775 --> 00:35:20,912
Ask the gentlemen
to start their engines.

00:35:20,912 --> 00:35:22,980
I think I can narrow
that down a bit.

00:35:24,136 --> 00:35:26,135
Based on the ratio
of contaminants

00:35:26,135 --> 00:35:29,135
found in the exhaust,
we're looking for an older car.

00:35:29,135 --> 00:35:32,137
<i>Pre-'70s... vintage.</i>

00:35:33,991 --> 00:35:35,526
Okay, Joe.
(engine starts)

00:35:35,526 --> 00:35:37,595
WILLOWS:
<i>Everyone in Vegas knows</i>

00:35:37,595 --> 00:35:39,897
<i>that you have a collection</i>
<i>of classic cars.</i>

00:35:39,897 --> 00:35:43,067
<i>You parade them up and down</i>
<i>the Strip every year.</i>

00:35:43,067 --> 00:35:44,502
<i>Your '64 Aston Martin</i>

is pre-catalytic converter.

00:35:46,871 --> 00:35:49,135
Puts out plenty
of carbon monoxide.

00:35:49,135 --> 00:35:51,609
The ratios of
hydrocarbons

00:35:51,609 --> 00:35:54,078
and nitrous oxides matches
the ratios that we found

00:35:54,078 --> 00:35:55,913
in Dr. Holloway's scuba tank.

00:35:55,913 --> 00:35:58,783
Willows, I flunked science.

00:35:58,783 --> 00:36:02,854
Are you trying to say
that my car killed Holloway?

00:36:02,854 --> 00:36:05,022
Why would it do that?

00:36:05,022 --> 00:36:07,132
Because you knew that Macklin
gave back a shark.

00:36:07,132 --> 00:36:09,527
And you knew who he gave it to:
the Aquavet.

00:36:09,527 --> 00:36:11,136
And you figured
that Macklin and

00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:13,137
the Aquavet were in cahoots,
so you had him whacked.

00:36:13,137 --> 00:36:16,135
You want to talk old school,
that's dinosaur times.

00:36:16,135 --> 00:36:19,134
I'd rather not state
the obvious,

00:36:19,134 --> 00:36:21,005
but my hotel is hot.

00:36:21,005 --> 00:36:23,441
Crawling with cops.

00:36:23,441 --> 00:36:24,709
I can't walk through my casino

00:36:24,709 --> 00:36:26,138
without bumping into you
and that other one.

00:36:26,138 --> 00:36:27,779
You got the wrong guy.

00:36:27,779 --> 00:36:30,138
Well, then how did the exhaust
from your vehicle end up

00:36:30,138 --> 00:36:31,616
in Dr. Holloway's tank?

00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:34,132
What am I, one of those
<i>Mythbustersguys?</i>

00:36:35,686 --> 00:36:37,889
I don't know.

00:36:37,889 --> 00:36:42,760
Look, when I was younger, the
tit for tat was better than sex.

00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,996
But these days
it just gives me indigestion.

00:36:44,996 --> 00:36:49,500
So when Macklin invited me to
dinner last night, I accepted.

00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:53,137
And when he said, "Let's
bury the hatchet," I said,

00:36:53,137 --> 00:36:54,539
"Consider it squashed."

00:36:54,539 --> 00:36:56,138
We broke bread.

00:36:56,138 --> 00:36:58,543
His joint-- Carne's.

00:36:58,543 --> 00:37:00,131
That used to mean something.

00:37:00,131 --> 00:37:02,139
Well, it doesn't mean
that you're off the hook.

00:37:02,139 --> 00:37:03,140
Willows,

00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:05,783
I'm telling you-- cards up--

00:37:05,783 --> 00:37:08,052
all I can give you is my word.

00:37:08,052 --> 00:37:09,887
That used
to mean something, too.

00:37:33,878 --> 00:37:36,135
Sorry to hear
about your friend.

00:37:36,135 --> 00:37:38,716
Good news is
she came to you,

00:37:38,716 --> 00:37:39,851
and now it's squashed.

00:37:39,851 --> 00:37:42,787
But remember one thing, Mugs...

00:37:42,787 --> 00:37:45,137
just because you say
it's squashed,

00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:46,858
doesn't mean it's squashed.

00:37:49,131 --> 00:37:51,963
Remember that,
Catherine.

00:38:05,476 --> 00:38:07,478
♪ ♪

00:38:15,139 --> 00:38:17,134
Evening, ladies.

00:38:17,134 --> 00:38:18,140
Oh, this is my spot.

00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:20,137
But don't go anywhere.
I'll need you.

00:38:20,137 --> 00:38:22,660
Hey, maybe I should
call Mr. Macklin.

00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:24,662
Uh, on second
thought, follow me.

00:38:24,662 --> 00:38:26,135
Any surveillance
on property?

00:38:26,135 --> 00:38:28,135
Only inside.

00:38:28,135 --> 00:38:30,868
And every car you valet
ends up where?

00:38:30,868 --> 00:38:32,132
In the lot.

00:38:32,132 --> 00:38:33,638
And what about
the boss's cars,

00:38:33,638 --> 00:38:34,839
or the boss's
friends' cars?

00:38:34,839 --> 00:38:37,133
We keep 'em right here.
Easy access. No waiting.

00:38:37,133 --> 00:38:39,136
Can I go now, ladies?

00:38:39,136 --> 00:38:40,912
SIDLE: You were
right, Catherine.

00:38:40,912 --> 00:38:43,047
I think I got something here.

00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,622
Hmm.

00:38:51,622 --> 00:38:52,924
Uh, what is this?

00:38:52,924 --> 00:38:55,059
I don't know.
I just park cars.

00:38:55,059 --> 00:38:57,131
Smells like exhaust.

00:38:57,131 --> 00:38:59,131
Are you sure that
you didn't see somebody

00:38:59,131 --> 00:39:00,498
using this last night?

00:39:00,498 --> 00:39:02,433
No.

00:39:04,869 --> 00:39:08,806
Oh, Sara, I think we've got
ourselves an eyewitness.

00:39:08,806 --> 00:39:11,709
SIDLE:
Yeah.

00:39:11,709 --> 00:39:14,512
WILLOWS:
You know the thing
about ATM machines?

00:39:14,512 --> 00:39:17,848
They take pictures
every 15 seconds.

00:39:17,848 --> 00:39:21,136
And you know what they say
about tiger sharks?

00:39:21,136 --> 00:39:24,088
They can't close
their mouths.

00:39:24,088 --> 00:39:25,135
Really?

00:39:25,135 --> 00:39:26,524
Neither can valet parkers.

00:39:26,524 --> 00:39:28,459
And this one gave
you up faster

00:39:28,459 --> 00:39:30,137
than a natural blackjack.

00:39:30,137 --> 00:39:32,530
(whispers):
No comment.

00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:34,432
No comment.

00:39:34,432 --> 00:39:35,833
That's beautiful.

00:39:35,833 --> 00:39:38,002
Beautiful.

00:39:38,002 --> 00:39:39,139
Let me tell you a story.

00:39:39,139 --> 00:39:41,906
How about you spare me
and not tell me a story?

00:39:41,906 --> 00:39:44,442
Once upon a time, there
was this two-bit mogul

00:39:44,442 --> 00:39:46,510
who made a cheap play
for a shark.

00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:47,845
He had buyer's remorse,

00:39:47,845 --> 00:39:50,139
so he thought he'd pawn it
off on his veterinarian.

00:39:50,139 --> 00:39:52,137
But then he had a better idea.

00:39:52,137 --> 00:39:54,134
He thought, "Maybe I'll make
some money."

00:39:54,134 --> 00:39:55,886
After all, it is Vegas.

00:39:55,886 --> 00:39:58,134
"Maybe I'll make the money back
that I spent on the shark

00:39:58,134 --> 00:40:00,825
and stick it to my enemy
at the same time."

00:40:00,825 --> 00:40:02,137
Earnest Boozell.

00:40:02,137 --> 00:40:04,061
So in order to make
this scam work,

00:40:04,061 --> 00:40:05,463
he needs the help
of the veterinarian.

00:40:05,463 --> 00:40:08,133
The veterinarian has
the key to Boozell's property

00:40:08,133 --> 00:40:10,131
and a means to dump it.

00:40:10,131 --> 00:40:11,602
How am I doing
so far, Catherine?

00:40:11,602 --> 00:40:13,037
Give him a couple
more bites.

00:40:13,037 --> 00:40:16,134
The Aquavet, he's the victim.

00:40:16,134 --> 00:40:17,708
He's not very bright.

00:40:17,708 --> 00:40:20,138
He was trying to remove the VIN
number from the fin--

00:40:20,138 --> 00:40:22,139
the "fin" number--

00:40:22,139 --> 00:40:24,131
'cause he thought that way,
we couldn't trace

00:40:24,131 --> 00:40:26,139
the shark back to you.
WILLOWS:
Because if there was

00:40:26,139 --> 00:40:27,852
a missing shark on
your property,

00:40:27,852 --> 00:40:30,133
you'd be the first
to know, right?

00:40:30,133 --> 00:40:32,134
BRASS:
I don't know what kind
of financial arrangement

00:40:32,134 --> 00:40:33,457
you had
with the veterinarian,

00:40:33,457 --> 00:40:35,526
but something happened,

00:40:35,526 --> 00:40:36,727
and he had to go.

00:40:36,727 --> 00:40:38,133
But you thought you'd cover
your tracks,

00:40:38,133 --> 00:40:39,630
so you tampered
with his scuba gear.

00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:42,867
And you thought you'd lay that
off on Boozell, as well.

00:40:42,867 --> 00:40:46,037
Why'd you do that?
I thought it was "squashed"?

00:40:46,037 --> 00:40:49,040
BRASS: So now our
story comes to an end.

00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:52,476
You're going down
for murder...

00:40:52,476 --> 00:40:55,579
hook, line and sinker.

00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:08,526
BOOZELL: Now you know
the little secret.

00:41:08,526 --> 00:41:11,529
Everyone thinks that this
is for the guests,

00:41:11,529 --> 00:41:13,631
but it's really for me.

00:41:13,631 --> 00:41:15,866
Spoken like a free man.

00:41:15,866 --> 00:41:18,903
I was wrong about you.

00:41:18,903 --> 00:41:22,131
I thought you were
just like your old man.

00:41:22,131 --> 00:41:23,507
How's that?

00:41:23,507 --> 00:41:25,134
Passionate, hardworking,

00:41:25,134 --> 00:41:26,136
driven by money?

00:41:26,136 --> 00:41:28,131
Two out of the three.

00:41:28,131 --> 00:41:29,547
Which two?

00:41:29,547 --> 00:41:33,136
Passionate,
hardworking.

00:41:33,136 --> 00:41:35,134
The truth is,
I'm driven by the money, too,

00:41:35,134 --> 00:41:36,887
just like your father.

00:41:36,887 --> 00:41:38,622
But you're not.

00:41:38,622 --> 00:41:40,134
You're different than us.

00:41:40,134 --> 00:41:44,139
Now I can see where
the greatness comes from.

00:41:44,139 --> 00:41:47,132
Thank you... for the compliment.

00:41:49,725 --> 00:41:52,131
Squashed?

00:41:52,131 --> 00:41:53,671
(chuckles)
