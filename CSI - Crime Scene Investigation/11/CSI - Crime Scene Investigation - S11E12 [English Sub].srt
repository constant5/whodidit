00:00:03,458 --> 00:00:04,925
MAN:
Not so smart now!

00:00:04,991 --> 00:00:06,925
(woman screams)
Get up...!

00:00:07,625 --> 00:00:09,591
(woman screaming)

00:00:09,658 --> 00:00:10,991
Shut up!
Agnes...

00:00:11,058 --> 00:00:12,591
Agnes!

00:00:13,725 --> 00:00:14,891
(screaming)
(knife scrapes, slashes)

00:00:15,958 --> 00:00:17,091
LANGSTON:
What do we got?

00:00:17,158 --> 00:00:19,291
OFFICER: Guy driving
by called it in.

00:00:19,358 --> 00:00:21,825
Checked it out, found a
body at the bottom-- DOA.

00:00:21,891 --> 00:00:22,858
SANDERS:
Middle of nowhere.

00:00:22,925 --> 00:00:24,158
Any idea how he got here?

00:00:24,225 --> 00:00:25,625
No vehicle in the vicinity.
I've just been

00:00:25,691 --> 00:00:27,958
keeping the buzzards off him
till you guys got here.

00:00:28,025 --> 00:00:30,191
Don't you think you should
tape off the crime scene?

00:00:30,258 --> 00:00:31,325
I'm on it.

00:00:31,391 --> 00:00:32,325
LANGSTON:
Thank you, Officer.

00:00:32,391 --> 00:00:34,091
We'll take it from here.

00:00:34,158 --> 00:00:35,925
Hey, guys, I'm
sorry I'm late.

00:00:35,991 --> 00:00:37,158
That's all right.

00:00:44,525 --> 00:00:45,958
Why can't people die

00:00:46,025 --> 00:00:48,625
closer to the road?

00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:56,725
He's still smoking,
so he hasn't been here long.

00:00:56,791 --> 00:01:00,458
The ground is soft,
loose gravel.

00:01:00,525 --> 00:01:02,631
No footprints out here
but our own.

00:01:02,698 --> 00:01:03,865
Body dump?

00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:05,031
Possibly.

00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:07,598
Looks like he might have
rolled down the hill

00:01:07,665 --> 00:01:09,265
from up on the road.

00:01:09,331 --> 00:01:11,798
Greg, a little help?Yeah.

00:01:14,898 --> 00:01:15,931
One, two, three.

00:01:20,098 --> 00:01:23,765
LANGSTON: Tongue's blackened,
swollen... teeth clenched.

00:01:23,831 --> 00:01:25,665
Nearly bit his own tongue off.

00:01:25,731 --> 00:01:26,665
PHILLIPS:
Looks like somebody

00:01:26,731 --> 00:01:28,131
took a flame thrower
to his head.

00:01:28,198 --> 00:01:29,531
But his hands aren't burned.

00:01:29,598 --> 00:01:31,331
His clothes
aren't burned either.

00:01:31,398 --> 00:01:33,998
SANDERS: Except for a bit
of singeing on the collar.

00:01:34,065 --> 00:01:35,531
Any guess on time of death?

00:01:35,598 --> 00:01:36,998
Give me a second.

00:01:46,265 --> 00:01:48,165
(yells)

00:01:48,231 --> 00:01:50,298
Whoa! Oh!
He's alive!

00:01:50,365 --> 00:01:52,598
(rapid panting)

00:01:52,665 --> 00:01:54,498
Roll medical! Stat!

00:01:54,565 --> 00:01:57,765
You guys stay here
and process the scene.

00:01:57,831 --> 00:01:58,998
I'll ride back with the victim.

00:01:59,065 --> 00:02:01,671
Push one mil adrenaline.
Let's go.

00:02:04,071 --> 00:02:06,071
Well, my work is done here.

00:02:06,138 --> 00:02:08,305
Call me if
his condition worsens.

00:02:12,405 --> 00:02:14,705

00:02:21,905 --> 00:02:23,871

I'll get it
to him now.
All right.

00:02:51,595 --> 00:02:53,995
So he didn't find any
I.D. on the victim.

00:02:54,061 --> 00:02:55,661
What do you
got down there?

00:02:55,728 --> 00:02:58,495
Uh, burned brush
and crushed vegetation

00:02:58,561 --> 00:03:01,668
and bloodstains running
down the hill from the road

00:03:01,735 --> 00:03:03,668
to where he came to a stop.

00:03:03,735 --> 00:03:05,801
<i>The guy's on fire, he rolls,</i>

00:03:05,868 --> 00:03:08,301
<i>the dust and vegetation
put him out.</i>

00:03:08,368 --> 00:03:10,568
Good thing he didn't start
the whole hillside on fire.

00:03:10,635 --> 00:03:11,901
Yeah.

00:03:11,968 --> 00:03:14,401
These tire tracks go
onto the shoulder,

00:03:14,468 --> 00:03:17,068
and then back onto the road
again without even stopping.

00:03:17,135 --> 00:03:19,568
Think he was tossed
from a moving vehicle?

00:03:19,635 --> 00:03:21,135
Maybe.
But the vehicle was a dualie.

00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:24,968
You can see here, four wheels
on the back axle. You see that?

00:03:25,035 --> 00:03:26,835
Mm-hmm. Could have
been a hate crime,

00:03:26,901 --> 00:03:27,968
a narco hit...

00:03:28,035 --> 00:03:29,168
Could have been
anything.

00:03:29,235 --> 00:03:30,668
Hopefully, this poor guy
survives.

00:03:30,735 --> 00:03:33,035
He can tell us himself
what happened out here.

00:03:33,101 --> 00:03:34,535
(monitor beeping steadily)

00:03:34,601 --> 00:03:36,701
(camera shutter clicking)

00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:51,099
Pardon me.

00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:52,499
I want to sample
that, please.

00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:02,306
LANGSTON:
<i>As you can see,</i>

00:04:02,372 --> 00:04:04,439
our victim has
third-degree burns

00:04:04,506 --> 00:04:06,806
covering approximately 90%

00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:09,206
of his head and face.

00:04:09,272 --> 00:04:10,839
In addition, there are
ligature marks

00:04:10,906 --> 00:04:13,406
at the wrists
and the ankles.

00:04:13,472 --> 00:04:14,772
He was tied up?
Correct.

00:04:14,839 --> 00:04:17,572
And now here,
the abrasions across the chest

00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:19,106
would indicate
that he was restrained

00:04:19,172 --> 00:04:20,639
with some kind of strap.

00:04:20,706 --> 00:04:22,572
Don't see that every day.
Nor this:

00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,739
a distinct burn pattern
at the right ankle.

00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,239
It's within
the ligature mark.

00:04:26,306 --> 00:04:27,239
And not only that,

00:04:27,306 --> 00:04:28,639
there's an even
more intense

00:04:28,706 --> 00:04:30,972
circular burn at the
crown of his head.

00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:33,606
Burn trauma radiating outward.

00:04:33,672 --> 00:04:35,706
So, Doctor, what turned him
into a Roman candle?

00:04:35,772 --> 00:04:37,106
Well, I have a theory.

00:04:37,172 --> 00:04:38,939
The distinctive burn pattern,

00:04:39,006 --> 00:04:41,506
the five-point restraint-- all
classic signs that this was

00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:44,672
execution... by electric chair.

00:04:44,739 --> 00:04:46,839
So, you're saying
somebody juiced this poor

00:04:46,906 --> 00:04:49,439
son of a bitch and just left him
on the side of the road?

00:04:49,506 --> 00:04:50,439
It's a theory.

00:04:50,506 --> 00:04:51,506
Oh, man, that
ain't right.

00:04:51,572 --> 00:04:55,239
Okay, next up, we have
the layout room.

00:04:55,306 --> 00:04:58,472
Group, I'd like you to meet
Dr. Raymond Langston,

00:04:58,539 --> 00:05:01,506
Nick Stokes and Greg Sanders.

00:05:01,572 --> 00:05:03,579
These are our CSI field agents.

00:05:03,646 --> 00:05:06,512
They go out and collect all
those little bits of evidence,

00:05:06,579 --> 00:05:09,512
and then they bring them to me
for answers.

00:05:09,579 --> 00:05:13,646
Ooh! Looks like they're cooking
up a searing mystery today.

00:05:13,712 --> 00:05:15,179
Are these pictures
of a murder victim?

00:05:15,246 --> 00:05:16,512
Attempted.

00:05:16,579 --> 00:05:18,179
I hear he's hanging
by a thread.

00:05:18,246 --> 00:05:19,746
You mean to say
that is still alive?

00:05:19,812 --> 00:05:20,779
Mmm.

00:05:20,846 --> 00:05:21,779
You know, Greg here

00:05:21,846 --> 00:05:23,312
is our lead man on the case.

00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:26,112
So if you have any questions,
you can direct them to him.

00:05:26,179 --> 00:05:27,946
Are you Mr. Lodges' boss?

00:05:28,012 --> 00:05:28,979
Hodges.

00:05:29,046 --> 00:05:30,946
Uh, not exactly.

00:05:31,012 --> 00:05:33,479
That's so horrible.
Is he gonna live?

00:05:33,546 --> 00:05:37,979
I'm sorry, but this is
an ongoing case.

00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:40,479
I can't really discuss
any of the details.

00:05:40,546 --> 00:05:43,412
Sorry.
(chuckles)

00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:45,379
I understand.

00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:48,046
What brings you here?
I teach

00:05:48,112 --> 00:05:49,579
fourth-grade science
and wanted to see

00:05:49,646 --> 00:05:51,412
if this is appropriate
for a field trip,

00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:53,979
but I'm afraid
it's a little too gory.

00:05:54,046 --> 00:05:55,412
Oh, honey, this is nothing.

00:05:55,479 --> 00:05:56,746
I could tell you stories

00:05:56,812 --> 00:05:58,146
that would just
curl your hair.

00:05:58,212 --> 00:05:59,912
SANDERS: The tour can
definitely be

00:05:59,979 --> 00:06:02,819
cleaned up
for more innocent eyes.

00:06:02,886 --> 00:06:05,186
LANGSTON: If it wouldn't be
too much trouble, do you mind

00:06:05,252 --> 00:06:06,419
taking these things
down to the lab

00:06:06,486 --> 00:06:07,519
and running them
for trace, please?

00:06:07,586 --> 00:06:09,086
Oh, don't worry.

00:06:09,152 --> 00:06:10,652
I'll take over
the tour for you.

00:06:10,719 --> 00:06:13,152
You go right ahead
and carry on, Mr. Lodges.

00:06:13,219 --> 00:06:17,252
Alas, ladies and gentlemen,
duty calls.

00:06:19,019 --> 00:06:21,086
I bid you adieu.

00:06:21,152 --> 00:06:22,352
LANGSTON: And now,
ladies and gentlemen,

00:06:22,419 --> 00:06:23,852
if you'll follow me--

00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,652
this way to reception.

00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,419
Uh, I can introduce
you to Judy,

00:06:28,486 --> 00:06:32,919
who will then explain to you
the intricacies of dispatch.

00:06:32,986 --> 00:06:34,419
STOKES:
You really shouldn't

00:06:34,486 --> 00:06:36,352
let her leave
without getting her number.

00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:38,652
She didn't come here
to get hit on.

00:06:38,719 --> 00:06:40,286
Dude, it's a pop fly
hit right to you.

00:06:40,352 --> 00:06:42,452
All you gotta do is put
your glove up and catch it.

00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:44,152
Ah...

00:06:44,219 --> 00:06:47,319
(mocks): Ah...
Trust me. Go. Go now.

00:06:53,852 --> 00:06:57,452
Hi. Um, I'm not trying
to be pushy or anything,

00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:58,819
but I was just thinking

00:06:58,886 --> 00:07:01,926
if you really want
to know more about the lab,

00:07:01,992 --> 00:07:03,592
maybe you could
give me your number

00:07:03,659 --> 00:07:06,259
and we could go out sometime
and talk about it.

00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:07,959
Normally, I wouldn't,

00:07:08,026 --> 00:07:10,926
but who could be
safer than a cop?

00:07:10,992 --> 00:07:14,192
Plus you seem really nice.

00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:15,326
Why not?

00:07:15,392 --> 00:07:16,326
All right.

00:07:21,726 --> 00:07:23,626
(chuckles)

00:07:23,692 --> 00:07:25,659
All right, thanks.

00:07:25,726 --> 00:07:26,959
Okay.
I'll call you.

00:07:27,026 --> 00:07:28,526
Bye.
Bye.

00:07:32,592 --> 00:07:34,259
♪ ♪

00:07:59,926 --> 00:08:02,499
♪ ♪

00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:28,999
What did Jell-O Man
ever do to you?

00:08:29,066 --> 00:08:31,532
Eh, some men were just
born to suffer.

00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,266
Since there's been no
call from the governor...

00:08:34,632 --> 00:08:36,732
See, in
an electrocution,

00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,666
current enters the head
through the skullcap

00:08:38,732 --> 00:08:40,499
and is drawn through the body

00:08:40,566 --> 00:08:42,532
by the grounding wire,
which is attached to the ankle.

00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:43,866
(screaming)

00:08:43,932 --> 00:08:45,632
<i>Amperage flows through
the heart long enough</i>

00:08:45,699 --> 00:08:48,399
<i>to ensure that it arrests.</i>

00:08:48,466 --> 00:08:52,166
So we have...
18.5 milliamps.

00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:54,666
That's more than enough juice
to stop a man's heart.

00:08:54,732 --> 00:08:56,799
But not enough
to light him up and cause

00:08:56,866 --> 00:08:58,699
the burns that we saw
on the vic's head.

00:08:58,766 --> 00:09:02,506
So either my theory's wrong
or we missed a variable.

00:09:02,572 --> 00:09:04,106
HODGES:
Try missing a variable.

00:09:04,172 --> 00:09:06,172
I analyzed the black flecks
you pulled

00:09:06,239 --> 00:09:07,406
from Almost Dead Guy's head.

00:09:07,472 --> 00:09:10,506
The material came
from a polyethylene sponge--

00:09:10,572 --> 00:09:12,072
synthetic, like this one.

00:09:12,139 --> 00:09:13,572
That explains it.

00:09:14,672 --> 00:09:16,639
LANGSTON:
A saline-solution-soaked

00:09:16,706 --> 00:09:22,972
sponge is used
to conduct electricity.

00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:25,639
But... the sponge
has to be natural.

00:09:25,706 --> 00:09:27,672
Otherwise...

00:09:27,739 --> 00:09:29,272
it impedes the charge.

00:09:40,806 --> 00:09:43,672
Using a synthetic sponge
increases resistance...

00:09:43,739 --> 00:09:45,172
(man screaming)

00:09:45,239 --> 00:09:48,372
<i>...converting most of
the electrical current to heat,</i>

00:09:48,439 --> 00:09:50,772
literally cooking the victim
in low amperage.

00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:58,472
There's not enough
to stop his heart.

00:09:58,539 --> 00:10:01,139
But definitely enough
to set his head on fire.

00:10:01,206 --> 00:10:02,846
You ever been to
Burning Man?

00:10:02,912 --> 00:10:04,912
I have now.

00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,879
So our killer is using
an electric chair.

00:10:06,946 --> 00:10:08,246
Which is easy enough
to construct.

00:10:08,312 --> 00:10:09,612
Yeah, you just
proved that.

00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:12,112
It's got to take a ton
of juice to fry someone.

00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:14,379
Maybe we can check
with LV Power and Water,

00:10:14,446 --> 00:10:16,646
see if there were
any surges on the grid.

00:10:16,712 --> 00:10:18,146
Well, unfortunately,
it's not about voltage,

00:10:18,212 --> 00:10:19,212
it's about amperage.

00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,679
If your connection
was strong enough,

00:10:20,746 --> 00:10:23,012
you could plug this thing
straight into the wall.

00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:25,179
So you're saying
that chair could be in

00:10:25,246 --> 00:10:26,479
any house in the city?

00:10:26,546 --> 00:10:27,612
Or truck.

00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:29,379
The evidence at the
crime scene says

00:10:29,446 --> 00:10:30,946
that the victim's head
was on fire

00:10:31,012 --> 00:10:32,679
when he was thrown
from a moving vehicle.

00:10:32,746 --> 00:10:34,579
Which means he had
just been fried.
Right.

00:10:34,646 --> 00:10:36,012
So, a mobile
killing machine?

00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,279
Right.

00:10:37,346 --> 00:10:39,479
SANDERS:
Catherine...

00:10:39,546 --> 00:10:42,346
Got a match.

00:10:42,412 --> 00:10:44,112
Tire tracks
were made by

00:10:44,179 --> 00:10:47,879
LT245/75R16 Michelin
light truck tire.

00:10:47,946 --> 00:10:50,546
Too bad it's only the most
common light truck tire

00:10:50,612 --> 00:10:52,012
in the Southwest.

00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,412
Well, truck
had two axles.

00:10:55,479 --> 00:10:57,646
Two tires in the front,
four in the back.

00:10:57,712 --> 00:10:58,712
Could be we're looking

00:10:58,779 --> 00:11:00,846
for a pickup or a cube van.

00:11:00,912 --> 00:11:02,752
All right.Also...

00:11:02,819 --> 00:11:06,119
got an I.D. on
our John Doe.

00:11:06,186 --> 00:11:08,152
Carlton Doreen.

00:11:08,219 --> 00:11:12,486
His, uh, wife reported him
missing two days ago.

00:11:12,552 --> 00:11:15,419
We matched his DNA
to exemplars from his home.

00:11:15,486 --> 00:11:16,686
And who is he?

00:11:16,752 --> 00:11:18,419
Uh, regular guy.

00:11:18,486 --> 00:11:20,452
Uh, works at a
hardware store.

00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:22,252
Uh, no record,

00:11:22,319 --> 00:11:26,586
no known enemies,
no outstanding debts.

00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:29,219
You look tired, Greg.
You should go home.

00:11:29,286 --> 00:11:31,619
Yeah, you're right.

00:11:31,686 --> 00:11:33,986
I'm burnt.

00:11:34,052 --> 00:11:37,086
Sorry. Unfortunate
choice of words.

00:11:37,152 --> 00:11:39,086
Go home.

00:11:42,586 --> 00:11:45,019
(sighs)

00:11:46,619 --> 00:11:48,852
Did you callher yet?

00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:50,719
You don't want me
to call her, do you?

00:11:50,786 --> 00:11:53,852
Don't let that
number go cold, now.

00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:55,852
(laughing)

00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:01,959
You don't waste
much time, do you?

00:12:02,026 --> 00:12:03,492
Did I call too soon?

00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:06,459
I hadn't even gotten home yet.

00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:08,759
But I'm glad you did.

00:12:08,826 --> 00:12:10,226
I was surprised
you were available.

00:12:10,292 --> 00:12:12,959
I've pretty much given up
on the dating scene.

00:12:13,026 --> 00:12:15,359
It's too painful.

00:12:18,892 --> 00:12:20,459
I feel wicked.

00:12:20,526 --> 00:12:22,959
I never drink on
a school night.

00:12:23,026 --> 00:12:25,592
Actually, I hardly
ever drink at all.

00:12:25,659 --> 00:12:27,492
Good thing I took the bus.

00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:28,892
What, you don't have a car?

00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,892
Mm-mm.

00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,426
Schoolteacher's salary.

00:12:32,492 --> 00:12:34,626
I figure if it's good
enough for my students,

00:12:34,692 --> 00:12:35,792
it's good enough for me.

00:12:35,859 --> 00:12:37,626
Your students must love you.

00:12:37,692 --> 00:12:39,159
Well, I don't know about that.

00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:41,192
But I bet they'd get a kick

00:12:41,259 --> 00:12:44,092
out of a visit
from a real scientist.

00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,892
(chuckles)
I'd be honored.

00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:50,392
To your students.

00:12:55,459 --> 00:12:56,626
Another toast.

00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,426
All right.

00:12:58,492 --> 00:13:01,299
To us.

00:13:01,366 --> 00:13:03,066
To us.

00:13:03,132 --> 00:13:04,332
(chuckles)

00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,299
Oops. Oopsy.

00:13:06,366 --> 00:13:09,399
(both chuckling)

00:13:11,432 --> 00:13:14,732
(no voice)

00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:19,199
(no voice)

00:13:22,099 --> 00:13:23,866
(no voice)

00:13:37,299 --> 00:13:39,432
I think they're going
to kick us out soon.

00:13:39,499 --> 00:13:41,132
We're the last ones here.

00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:42,266
All right,
we should probably go.

00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,532
(sighs)

00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:54,899
It's getting cold out.

00:13:54,966 --> 00:13:56,132
Mm-hmm.

00:13:56,199 --> 00:13:58,899
I'm not letting you
ride the bus.

00:13:58,966 --> 00:14:00,399
Let's share a cab.

00:14:00,466 --> 00:14:02,472
Okay.

00:14:02,539 --> 00:14:04,839
I don't want this night to end.

00:14:04,905 --> 00:14:08,605
Doesn't have to.

00:14:16,872 --> 00:14:19,005
SANDERS:
<i>She's amazing.</i>

00:14:19,072 --> 00:14:22,105
Smart... and grounded,
and-- get this--

00:14:22,172 --> 00:14:24,039
the rarest of
all things,

00:14:24,105 --> 00:14:25,772
she's a beautiful woman

00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,905
who has no idea how
beautiful she is.

00:14:27,972 --> 00:14:29,072
Yeah!

00:14:29,139 --> 00:14:30,172
I wouldn't steer
you wrong, bud.

00:14:30,239 --> 00:14:31,239
Oh, get this.

00:14:31,305 --> 00:14:33,339
She smells like
fresh peaches.

00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:34,605
Peaches?

00:14:34,672 --> 00:14:36,539
Yeah, you know,
like peaches.

00:14:36,605 --> 00:14:38,805
Like, what a peach
smells like.

00:14:38,872 --> 00:14:41,406
Yeah, nice.
So you didn't, uh...

00:14:41,472 --> 00:14:42,472
No, you know what?

00:14:42,539 --> 00:14:44,472
Don't tell me.
I don't want to know.

00:14:48,339 --> 00:14:50,639
Dualies.

00:14:50,706 --> 00:14:52,839
Man, I don't like
the look of that.

00:14:52,906 --> 00:14:56,739
Well, you're not going to like
the look of this, either.

00:15:08,346 --> 00:15:09,946
Moderate burns
on the crown,

00:15:10,012 --> 00:15:12,846
but no collateral burns to
the head like the last victim.

00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,579
SANDERS:
Clenched teeth,

00:15:14,646 --> 00:15:15,979
swollen tongue.

00:15:16,046 --> 00:15:19,646
STOKES: Same ligature marks
as Carlton Doreen.

00:15:19,712 --> 00:15:21,246
You mind
if I lift his shirt, Doc?

00:15:21,312 --> 00:15:23,612
Be my guest.

00:15:26,646 --> 00:15:28,812
Five-point restraints.

00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:31,912
Same burn within
the ligature mark.

00:15:31,979 --> 00:15:34,212
Looks like somebody else
got the chair.

00:15:37,346 --> 00:15:39,979
SANDERS:
Storage facility over there.

00:15:40,046 --> 00:15:41,246
Maybe we can pull
surveillance.

00:15:41,312 --> 00:15:42,246
Yeah, all right.

00:15:42,312 --> 00:15:44,112
Now, wait a minute, now.

00:15:44,179 --> 00:15:45,612
You sure you
want to do that?

00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:47,446
Hmph!

00:15:57,212 --> 00:15:59,579
This one is actually dead.

00:16:05,644 --> 00:16:07,077
So we've got two victims,
both fried

00:16:07,144 --> 00:16:08,744
in some kind of
mobile electric chair.

00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:10,144
Right.

00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:13,077
But our first guy,
Carlton Doreen, didn't die.

00:16:13,144 --> 00:16:15,544
We I.D.'d our second victim.

00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:19,577
Elijah Newbloom III.

00:16:19,644 --> 00:16:20,677
Any connection to Doreen?

00:16:20,744 --> 00:16:21,844
Not really.

00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,577
Both are about the same age.

00:16:23,644 --> 00:16:25,110
Both from Vegas money.

00:16:25,177 --> 00:16:27,344
But Doreen's family
lost its fortune.

00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:29,444
Now he's a working stiff.

00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:31,477
Newbloom, on the other hand,
is a trust-fund kid

00:16:31,544 --> 00:16:33,477
who's never had to work
a day in his life.

00:16:33,544 --> 00:16:34,944
Sounds like they don't
travel in the same circle.

00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:35,944
I doubt it.

00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:38,444
But they do intersect

00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:41,510
at the corner of Doreen Avenue
and Newbloom Boulevard.

00:16:41,577 --> 00:16:44,110
Really?

00:16:44,177 --> 00:16:46,777
So maybe somebody's

00:16:46,844 --> 00:16:48,810
picking out victims
by street names.

00:16:48,877 --> 00:16:50,444
Well, if your intent
is just to kill,

00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,944
it's not a bad way
to randomize your targets.

00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:54,910
Found something interesting.

00:16:54,977 --> 00:16:57,110
Both the victims'
skin and clothing

00:16:57,177 --> 00:16:59,744
showed trace amounts
for ammonium perchlorate.

00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,050
But exemplars from the soil
at both crime scenes

00:17:02,117 --> 00:17:03,317
were negative for the chemical.

00:17:03,384 --> 00:17:04,317
Perchlorate?

00:17:04,384 --> 00:17:06,650
That's the
industrial oxidizer

00:17:06,717 --> 00:17:08,350
that contaminated
a large section

00:17:08,417 --> 00:17:09,850
of ground soil in Henderson

00:17:09,917 --> 00:17:12,617
after the Phosphodyne
explosion in '88.

00:17:12,684 --> 00:17:14,117
Ground's still
contaminated there.

00:17:14,184 --> 00:17:16,584
Maybe that's where
our electrocutioner is set up.

00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,550
I'll have Brass run
some unis through the area.

00:17:18,617 --> 00:17:20,184
Hey.

00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,817
I think I found our truck.

00:17:21,884 --> 00:17:26,184
Elijah Newbloom's T.O.D. was
between midnight and 3:00 a.m.

00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,284
The storage facility
across from the body dump

00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:29,717
has surveillance cameras.

00:17:29,784 --> 00:17:33,484
So I caught this truck
on the move at 2:30 a.m.

00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:36,484
It was the only vehicle
on the road at the time.

00:17:40,384 --> 00:17:43,050
Truck belongs
to one Johannes DeSmoot.

00:17:43,117 --> 00:17:45,250
Guy owns an appliance
repair shop in North Vegas.

00:17:45,317 --> 00:17:47,650
(cell phone ringing)

00:17:48,917 --> 00:17:50,850
Excuse me.

00:17:54,517 --> 00:17:56,250
Hello.
ELLEN: Hi, Greg.

00:17:56,317 --> 00:17:57,517
We still on for tonight?

00:17:57,584 --> 00:17:58,684
Oh, you know...

00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,917
I'm sorry,
but I-I don't think so.

00:18:00,984 --> 00:18:04,257
We're making some headway
on the case,

00:18:04,324 --> 00:18:06,624
and, uh, I think it's going
to be a late night.

00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,690
Oh, don't worry,
I completely understand.

00:18:08,757 --> 00:18:09,990
Hey, that's great
about the headway.

00:18:10,057 --> 00:18:11,257
Yeah.

00:18:11,324 --> 00:18:13,424
Do you think I could get
a rain check for tonight?

00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:15,324
Rain, sun, sleet or hail.

00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:16,924
Just call me when you can.

00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:18,357
But don't wait too long, okay?

00:18:18,424 --> 00:18:20,324
I won't.

00:18:21,824 --> 00:18:24,157
Problem, "Lodges"?

00:18:24,224 --> 00:18:27,724
Don't let us interrupt
your personal life.

00:18:30,657 --> 00:18:32,324
(sighs)

00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:33,690
So, uh...

00:18:33,757 --> 00:18:36,190
you run a background on DeSmoot?

00:18:36,257 --> 00:18:38,924
Yep. He used to work
as an interrogator

00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:41,157
for the South African
secret police,

00:18:41,224 --> 00:18:43,857
before he fled the country
at the end of apartheid.

00:18:43,924 --> 00:18:45,924
Probably no stranger
to throwing a guy in a chair

00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:47,957
and sending a few volts
through him.

00:18:49,057 --> 00:18:50,457
Where's your truck, Johannes?

00:18:50,524 --> 00:18:54,357
I told you, I sold it, and
I can't find the paperwork.

00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:55,857
And you can't
remember a description

00:18:55,924 --> 00:18:57,957
of the buyer, either.
Try a little harder.

00:18:58,024 --> 00:19:00,190
Uh, it was raining, man.
And dark.

00:19:00,257 --> 00:19:02,364
The guy was wearing a fedora.

00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:05,097
His face, it was in the shadows.

00:19:05,164 --> 00:19:07,030
He was a right tall
regular giant.

00:19:07,097 --> 00:19:08,164
Ooh, spooky.

00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,164
And in a hurry. He paid cash.

00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:12,330
I had my stooky, hot to trot,

00:19:12,397 --> 00:19:14,864
out in the back room,
so I signed over the deed

00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:17,497
and he chucked out quick
without so much as a thank you.

00:19:17,564 --> 00:19:19,997
You remember all that, why
can't you remember his handle?

00:19:20,064 --> 00:19:22,130
I'm telling you, I can't,
and that's the truth.

00:19:22,197 --> 00:19:24,364
You know, the truck is still
registered in your name.

00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,997
Hey, if the oak never
switched over the deed,

00:19:27,064 --> 00:19:28,697
it wouldn't be my swakkie,
now, would it?

00:19:28,764 --> 00:19:29,697
What?

00:19:29,764 --> 00:19:32,397
If I was lying,
don't you think

00:19:32,464 --> 00:19:35,530
I'd be doff not to make up
a name and a description?

00:19:35,597 --> 00:19:38,364
If not, you're dumber
than you look,

00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:40,664
and that'd take some doing,
now, wouldn't it?

00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:42,530
You know, it's bad form
to insult the guy

00:19:42,597 --> 00:19:44,164
who holds your future
in his hands.

00:19:47,364 --> 00:19:49,397
Your work permit
expired six months ago.

00:19:49,464 --> 00:19:50,864
That means I
can hold you.

00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:52,697
I'm going to find
your truck, Johnny,

00:19:52,764 --> 00:19:54,230
and when I do, I'm
going to put you

00:19:54,297 --> 00:19:55,197
in a box marked
"perishable"

00:19:55,264 --> 00:19:56,364
and ship you back
to South Africa.

00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:58,097
Then I'm going to
e-mail all the guys

00:19:58,164 --> 00:20:00,030
you put a cattle
prod into,

00:20:00,097 --> 00:20:01,464
tell them you're
coming home,

00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:05,037
and maybe they'll have
a clambake for you.

00:20:08,637 --> 00:20:09,870
Knock, knock.

00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:12,270

00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:14,537
Thank you, Lodges.

00:20:14,604 --> 00:20:16,070
I brought sandwiches.

00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:20,404

I'm the kind of girl

00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,970

00:20:22,037 --> 00:20:23,904

out of my mind.

00:20:33,837 --> 00:20:35,737

Hey, how's that
poor burn victim

00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:39,704
in the hospital doing?

00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:41,104
He's actually making progress.

00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:43,704
We're hoping that he'll help us
identify our killer.

00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:45,337

00:20:45,404 --> 00:20:46,537

both had chloroform
in their system.

00:21:05,144 --> 00:21:06,944

probably how they were abducted.

00:30:36,172 --> 00:30:37,939
But you can't tell me that our
three victims aren't related.

00:30:38,006 --> 00:30:40,339
The Rat!
The what?

00:30:40,406 --> 00:30:42,572
Herzog--Hershkowitz.

00:30:42,639 --> 00:30:44,572
The Rat!

00:30:53,106 --> 00:30:55,039
(sighs)

00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:04,446
(sighs)

00:31:23,346 --> 00:31:25,279
SANDERS:
<i>Our victims are connected,</i>

00:31:25,346 --> 00:31:29,079
<i>but the story begins long
before any of them were born.</i>

00:31:29,146 --> 00:31:31,146
<i>At the end of World War II,</i>

00:31:31,212 --> 00:31:33,112
<i>Bugsy Siegel plucked</i>

00:31:33,179 --> 00:31:36,279
the great French chanteuse,
Agnes LaPlouffe,

00:31:36,346 --> 00:31:38,779
from the ruins of Europe
and brought her to Vegas

00:31:38,846 --> 00:31:40,046
to make her a star.

00:31:40,112 --> 00:31:41,479
During the war,

00:31:41,546 --> 00:31:44,979
Agnes had lost her life's
true love-- or so she thought--

00:31:45,046 --> 00:31:46,479
the great Ballet Russe dancer,

00:31:46,546 --> 00:31:49,779
Boris Kuchko,
in the siege of Leningrad.

00:31:49,846 --> 00:31:51,112
But Kuchko survived,

00:31:51,179 --> 00:31:53,912
and made his way barefoot
across Siberia,

00:31:53,979 --> 00:31:56,179
and secretly reunited
with Agnes

00:31:56,246 --> 00:31:58,879
in Vegas in 1946,

00:31:58,946 --> 00:32:00,812
when they had a
daughter out of wedlock.

00:32:00,879 --> 00:32:03,052
I remember this story.
It was Las Vegas legend.

00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:05,152
My father's idea of

00:32:05,219 --> 00:32:07,086
a soothing bedtime tale
for a little girl.

00:32:07,152 --> 00:32:11,919
<i>Agnes and Kuchko had
to hide their love from Bugsy,</i>

00:32:11,986 --> 00:32:13,952
<i>who considered Agnes
his property.</i>

00:32:14,019 --> 00:32:16,152
SANDERS:
<i>She spent furtive weekends</i>

00:32:16,219 --> 00:32:19,552
<i>with Kuchko holed up in
an anonymous motel in Santa Fe,</i>

00:32:19,619 --> 00:32:22,619
<i>plotting her escape
from Bugsy's clutches.</i>

00:32:22,686 --> 00:32:24,986
<i>As his suspicions grew,</i>

00:32:25,052 --> 00:32:29,086
<i>Bugsy had his henchmen follow
Agnes and Kuchko to New Mexico.</i>

00:32:32,552 --> 00:32:33,752
(man grunts)

00:32:33,819 --> 00:32:36,919
(screaming)

00:32:36,986 --> 00:32:37,786
No!

00:32:37,852 --> 00:32:39,419
Agnes!

00:32:42,852 --> 00:32:44,819
Agnes! Agnes!

00:32:44,886 --> 00:32:47,886
Agnes!

00:32:47,952 --> 00:32:49,619
Agnes...!

00:32:49,686 --> 00:32:52,752
(screaming)

00:32:55,319 --> 00:32:58,152
WILLOWS: <i>They dragged her out
and they decapitated her,</i>

00:32:58,219 --> 00:33:00,119
<i>leaving her body</i>

00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:03,492
<i>in this hideous dance pose
to implicate Kuchko.</i>

00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:05,059
Where we going
with all this, Greg?

00:33:05,126 --> 00:33:07,826
Bugsy framed Kuchko
for Agnes's murder,

00:33:07,892 --> 00:33:09,559
relying on the bogus
eyewitness account

00:33:09,626 --> 00:33:14,292
of a stoolie and small-time
operator for the Mob--

00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:16,759
Herzog "The Rat" Hershkowitz.

00:33:16,826 --> 00:33:18,092
Grandfather

00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:20,159
of our third victim--
Hammish Hershkowitz?

00:33:20,226 --> 00:33:21,226
Right.

00:33:21,292 --> 00:33:23,392
Ambrose Doreen

00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:25,926
and Elijah Newbloom the First--

00:33:25,992 --> 00:33:27,859
the prosecutor
and defense attorney--

00:33:27,926 --> 00:33:29,926
were both in Bugsy's pocket,

00:33:29,992 --> 00:33:31,592
paid to throw the case.

00:33:31,659 --> 00:33:32,626
There's our connection.

00:33:32,692 --> 00:33:35,359
Doreen and Newbloom are
the grandfathers

00:33:35,426 --> 00:33:37,559
of our first and second victim.

00:33:37,626 --> 00:33:39,126
Bugsy made them both rich men.

00:33:39,192 --> 00:33:41,292
SANDERS: And they became
pillars of Vegas society,

00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:44,192
with streets and parks
named after them.

00:33:44,259 --> 00:33:47,226
Now, everybody knew Kuchko
was innocent of Agnes' murder,

00:33:47,292 --> 00:33:48,392
but the fix was in.

00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:49,759
Tabloids had a field day

00:33:49,826 --> 00:33:54,192
and a jury in New Mexico
demanded Boris Kuchko's life.

00:33:54,259 --> 00:33:57,426
He went to the chair
proclaiming his innocence

00:33:57,492 --> 00:33:58,626
to the end.
LANGSTON:
Ironic,

00:33:58,692 --> 00:34:00,026
to say the least.

00:34:00,092 --> 00:34:02,532
Two survivors of the Nazi
and Stalinist killing machines

00:34:02,599 --> 00:34:03,799
come to the land of the free

00:34:03,866 --> 00:34:05,532
only to die
because they ran afoul

00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:07,132
of a psychotic Jewish mobster.

00:34:07,199 --> 00:34:08,966
Well, this is one
hell of a story,

00:34:09,032 --> 00:34:10,266
but what are we
really saying here--

00:34:10,332 --> 00:34:11,366
that there's
a psychopath

00:34:11,432 --> 00:34:14,766
out there
with a mobile electric chair

00:34:14,832 --> 00:34:15,899
who's killing the descendants

00:34:15,966 --> 00:34:17,899
of the men who killed
some French singer

00:34:17,966 --> 00:34:18,799
and her Russian boyfriend?

00:34:18,866 --> 00:34:19,866
I buy it.

00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:21,366
Someone's avenging history.
Why not?

00:34:21,432 --> 00:34:23,099
This is very strange.
Well,

00:34:23,166 --> 00:34:26,932
it's about to get
a whole lot stranger.

00:34:28,999 --> 00:34:30,199
STOKES:
You gotta be kidding me.

00:34:30,266 --> 00:34:31,399
WILLOWS:
What?

00:34:31,466 --> 00:34:32,466
Well, that's Greg's girlfriend.

00:34:32,532 --> 00:34:34,366
SANDERS:
Actually,

00:34:34,432 --> 00:34:36,099
that is Agnes LaPlouffe.

00:34:37,799 --> 00:34:39,732
This is Ellen.

00:34:39,799 --> 00:34:41,632
LANGSTON:
They could be twins.

00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:43,132
Born 70 years apart.

00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:46,199
Ellen is Agnes's granddaughter.

00:34:46,266 --> 00:34:48,899
WILLOWS:
Rita Von Squeeze.

00:34:48,966 --> 00:34:50,966
Aka Ellen Whitebridge?

00:34:51,032 --> 00:34:52,232
WILLOWS:
Greg...

00:34:52,299 --> 00:34:54,599
your girlfriend
is not looking so good.I know.

00:34:54,666 --> 00:34:57,466
But I also know that she's not
capable of killing three men.

00:34:57,532 --> 00:34:58,799
She wouldn't do it.

00:34:58,866 --> 00:34:59,866
You don't know that.

00:34:59,932 --> 00:35:00,966
And what about her
manager/boyfriend

00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:02,806
Hammerbacher?

00:35:02,872 --> 00:35:04,072
LANGSTON:
I hate to say it, Greg,

00:35:04,139 --> 00:35:05,572
but it looks like you're
in over your head here.

00:35:05,639 --> 00:35:06,739
That's what I keep trying
to tell him.

00:35:06,806 --> 00:35:08,139
Have you had
any conversations

00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:09,639
with her
about this investigation?

00:35:09,706 --> 00:35:11,206
No.
No?

00:35:11,272 --> 00:35:13,572
I mean... I don't know, maybe.

00:35:13,639 --> 00:35:15,206
Maybe?

00:35:15,272 --> 00:35:16,772
(cell phone ringing)

00:35:21,539 --> 00:35:24,239
Excuse me.

00:35:25,506 --> 00:35:26,906
Sanders.

00:35:26,972 --> 00:35:28,972
It's Ellen.

00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:31,106
I'm in trouble.

00:35:35,706 --> 00:35:37,306
ELLEN:
Greg, I need to see you.

00:35:37,372 --> 00:35:38,472
I need to explain.

00:35:38,539 --> 00:35:39,472
Explain what?

00:35:39,539 --> 00:35:40,606
Please, I'm scared.

00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:42,372
I think someone's trying
to kill me.

00:35:42,439 --> 00:35:43,839
Who?

00:35:43,906 --> 00:35:45,539
Give me a name.

00:35:45,606 --> 00:35:49,306
There's a diner on the northwest
corner of Grant and St. Marie.

00:35:49,372 --> 00:35:50,306
I know the place.

00:35:50,372 --> 00:35:51,306
Meet me there.

00:35:51,372 --> 00:35:53,272
You're the only one I trust.

00:35:53,339 --> 00:35:54,539
(line clicks)

00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,146
(engine revving)

00:36:23,212 --> 00:36:24,212
(tires screeching)

00:36:41,179 --> 00:36:43,112
(people gasping, screaming)

00:36:54,046 --> 00:36:57,312
(panting)

00:36:59,212 --> 00:37:01,086
Peaches.

00:37:17,786 --> 00:37:19,719
(cell phone ringing)

00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:25,652
Sanders.

00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:27,419
WOMAN:
Uh, yes, Mr. Sanders?

00:37:27,486 --> 00:37:29,219
I believe you
left a message for me earlier.

00:37:29,286 --> 00:37:30,486
Who is this?

00:37:30,552 --> 00:37:32,686
This is Ellen Whitebridge
from Adams Elementary.

00:37:32,752 --> 00:37:34,686
Is there something
I can help you with?

00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:35,919
(sighs)

00:37:35,986 --> 00:37:38,819
I think there's been
some kind of mistake.

00:37:38,886 --> 00:37:41,352
Sorry to bother you.

00:37:46,811 --> 00:37:48,979
Vartann called from a diner--
attempted hit-and-run.

00:37:49,045 --> 00:37:50,179
Shots were fired,
nobody was hit,

00:37:50,245 --> 00:37:51,412
but one of the
patrons described

00:37:51,479 --> 00:37:52,612
the target
fleeing the scene

00:37:52,679 --> 00:37:55,379
as a slender white
male, 30s, sandy hair.

00:37:55,445 --> 00:37:57,012
Says he tore off
in a black SUV.

00:37:57,079 --> 00:37:58,812
That sounds a lot like Greg.
Yeah, I've been trying

00:37:58,879 --> 00:38:00,579
to get him on the horn.
Have you talked to him?

00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:01,852
I tried,
but he's not picking up.

00:38:01,919 --> 00:38:04,085
What was he doing in a diner
where shots were fired?

00:38:04,152 --> 00:38:05,419
And why hasn't he
checked in with us?

00:38:05,485 --> 00:38:06,585
This woman's got him
really twisted up.

00:38:06,652 --> 00:38:08,085
Found trace
on our third victim--

00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:10,485
not just perchlorate,
as we found on the first two,

00:38:10,552 --> 00:38:11,785
but also magnesium oxide.

00:38:11,852 --> 00:38:13,085
LANGSTON: That's used
in the manufacture

00:38:13,152 --> 00:38:14,519
of paint.
I just checked.

00:38:14,585 --> 00:38:17,385
The Dunley Paint Company
is within the radius

00:38:17,452 --> 00:38:18,785
of perchlorate
contamination.

00:38:18,852 --> 00:38:20,219
Factory's been
shuttered ever since.

00:38:20,285 --> 00:38:22,085
Okay, Ray,
check it out with Nick.

00:38:22,152 --> 00:38:23,585
I'll have Brass
send backup.

00:38:23,652 --> 00:38:25,585
(cell phone rings)
Right.

00:38:29,352 --> 00:38:33,052
MAN (over P.A.):
8:10 to Los Angeles now
boarding at terminal seven.

00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:35,385
(sirens wailing)

00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:43,952
OFFICER: This is King 3-2;
we have shots fired!

00:38:44,019 --> 00:38:45,985
I repeat:
we have shots fired!

00:38:54,319 --> 00:38:56,185
(grunts)

00:39:04,859 --> 00:39:06,792
(sighs)

00:39:18,104 --> 00:39:19,904
BRASS:
Hammerbacher, open up!

00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:21,570
There's no way out!

00:39:21,637 --> 00:39:23,270
HAMMERBACHER:
No! She's coming

00:39:23,337 --> 00:39:25,070
and we're going to blow
out of here together!

00:39:25,137 --> 00:39:26,037
Who's coming out?

00:39:26,104 --> 00:39:27,404
Who?Ellen!

00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:29,770
She said that if I did
everything she told me,

00:39:29,837 --> 00:39:31,370
that we were going
to disappear together.

00:39:31,437 --> 00:39:32,604
We were going to find
an island somewhere.

00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:33,704
Hammerbacher,

00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:35,504
she's not coming;
she's gone.

00:39:36,937 --> 00:39:38,104
You're surrounded,

00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:39,404
so give yourself up.

00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:41,237
(whirring)

00:39:41,304 --> 00:39:43,104
That's a generator.
Deploy.

00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:48,204
Flash shots!

00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:53,037
(three explosions)

00:39:53,104 --> 00:39:54,570
Hold your fire.

00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:57,037
(grunting)

00:40:01,637 --> 00:40:03,977
Hammerbacher, look,
you don't have to...

00:40:04,044 --> 00:40:06,410
I'll see you in the next life!

00:40:06,477 --> 00:40:07,510
(screaming)

00:40:10,877 --> 00:40:12,710
(groaning)

00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:15,477
(electricity
crackles and buzzes)

00:40:15,544 --> 00:40:18,377
(indistinct announcement
over P.A.)

00:40:22,244 --> 00:40:23,944
Ellen?

00:40:27,044 --> 00:40:28,577
Oh, Greg.

00:40:28,644 --> 00:40:30,044
Thank God you're okay.

00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:32,677
When I heard the gunshots,
I panicked and I ran.

00:40:32,744 --> 00:40:34,444
I thought you
were dead.

00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:38,377
I had to get out of town;
I knew I'd be next.

00:40:38,444 --> 00:40:40,644
You used me.

00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:43,477
No, you've got
it all wrong.

00:40:43,544 --> 00:40:45,310
It was all
Hammerbacher's idea.

00:40:45,377 --> 00:40:47,577
We fell for
each other hard,

00:40:47,644 --> 00:40:49,344
but then I realized
he was a monster.

00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:50,877
Yeah, then why didn't
you leave him?

00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:52,544
I did; that's
what set him off.

00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:56,177
He was in love with me,
like, crazy in love.

00:40:56,244 --> 00:40:57,644
Crazy's right.

00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:59,977
You met the man.

00:41:00,044 --> 00:41:01,410
He thought he
could win me back

00:41:01,477 --> 00:41:03,084
by avenging my
family's honor.

00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:05,517
You set me up
to die tonight.

00:41:05,584 --> 00:41:07,917
No, I swear, I had no
idea he was gonna--

00:41:07,984 --> 00:41:09,484
You were playing me
from the start.

00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:10,717
You came to my lab,

00:41:10,784 --> 00:41:11,784
you looked
through my files.

00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:13,850
You saw that we had
a picture of the truck,

00:41:13,917 --> 00:41:15,517
so you went
and you switched trucks.

00:41:15,584 --> 00:41:16,984
Hammerbacher made me do it.

00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:23,950
I don't think you know
where the truth ends

00:41:24,017 --> 00:41:25,384
and your own lies begin.

00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:29,417
We got the truck.

00:41:29,484 --> 00:41:31,450
And we both know your prints
are going to be all over it.

00:41:34,984 --> 00:41:37,850
My grandparents didn't
deserve to die that way.

00:41:39,884 --> 00:41:41,817
The slate's been
wiped clean now.

00:41:41,884 --> 00:41:44,717
You can understand that,
can't you, Greg, baby?

00:41:46,817 --> 00:41:49,050
MAN (over P.A.): Now departing
for Los Angeles-- last call.

00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:53,017
Come with me.

00:41:54,717 --> 00:41:57,384
I'll make you happier
than you ever dreamed.

00:41:59,084 --> 00:42:01,217
We'll leave this
place of death behind

00:42:01,284 --> 00:42:04,157
and find an
island somewhere.

00:42:06,157 --> 00:42:08,924
I'll do anythingyou say.

00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:10,990
Anything.

00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,924
(bus engine starts,
brakes hiss)

00:42:26,424 --> 00:42:28,390
Greg, please, no.

00:42:28,457 --> 00:42:30,557
Take her in.

00:42:30,624 --> 00:42:31,590
Let's go.

00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:35,624
For what it's worth...

00:42:37,057 --> 00:42:39,690
...I've loved you
since Tuesday.

00:42:48,957 --> 00:42:50,224
You did good.

00:42:50,290 --> 00:42:51,857
Yeah, well, most bosses
wouldn't have given me

00:42:51,924 --> 00:42:53,390
the chance to
make it right.

00:42:53,457 --> 00:42:56,657
Oh, make no mistake,
I'm pissed off at you, Greg.

00:42:56,724 --> 00:42:59,490
You disappeared on us,
you walked into an ambush,

00:42:59,557 --> 00:43:01,157
you almost got
yourself killed,

00:43:01,224 --> 00:43:02,864
and then you left
the scene of a crime.

00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:04,997
Am I on suspension?

00:43:05,064 --> 00:43:08,230
You should be.

00:43:08,297 --> 00:43:11,930
But I'm the last one
who should be throwing stones.

00:43:13,197 --> 00:43:15,430
I've been blinded
by lust once or twice.

00:43:15,497 --> 00:43:17,630
Just do me a favor.

00:43:17,697 --> 00:43:20,264
The next time you get the hots
for a mysterious babe,

00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:22,197
let me check her out
for you.

00:43:22,264 --> 00:43:23,397
(scoffs)

00:43:23,464 --> 00:43:25,264
I got an eye
for the rotten ones.

00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:27,630
Deal.

00:43:28,664 --> 00:43:30,697
(sighs)

00:43:30,764 --> 00:43:33,130
Catherine...

00:43:33,197 --> 00:43:37,188
Yeah?
Why do the rotten
ones smell so good?
