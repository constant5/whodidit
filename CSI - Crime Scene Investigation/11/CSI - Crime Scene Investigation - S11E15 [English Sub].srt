00:00:04,208 --> 00:00:05,309
Hey, Nick.

00:00:05,309 --> 00:00:06,344
Hey, there he is!

00:00:06,344 --> 00:00:07,410
Where are you heading?

00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:09,180
Well, if I don't go
to the gym now,

00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,148
I won't go at all.
You feeling

00:00:11,148 --> 00:00:13,351
obligated to leave Doc Robbins
a good-looking corpse?

00:00:13,351 --> 00:00:16,153
(chuckles)
Yeah, something like that.

00:00:16,153 --> 00:00:18,409
Hey, you got a big day
in court today, don't you?

00:00:18,409 --> 00:00:19,409
Yeah. Nate Haskell.

00:00:19,409 --> 00:00:21,993
Putting my game face on.

00:00:21,993 --> 00:00:24,161
Well... I'd tell you
to give him hell,

00:00:24,161 --> 00:00:26,898
but that's probably
where he's going anyway.

00:00:26,898 --> 00:00:28,414
Good luck.
Thanks.

00:00:28,414 --> 00:00:30,201
Yeah.

00:00:43,915 --> 00:00:45,417
(lock buzzes)

00:01:02,266 --> 00:01:04,268
HASKELL:
<i>Your Honor, I've spent</i>

00:01:04,268 --> 00:01:05,416
the last three days
in this courtroom

00:01:05,416 --> 00:01:07,409
trying to control myself,

00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:09,907
which has not been easy,
I assure you.

00:01:09,907 --> 00:01:15,346
The media has tried to portray
me as some sort of monster,

00:01:15,346 --> 00:01:18,415
some seven-headed beast
who sprang from a smoking pit

00:01:18,415 --> 00:01:20,284
to spread death across the land.

00:01:20,284 --> 00:01:25,416
But here I sit,
caged, before you,

00:01:25,416 --> 00:01:29,794
a man like any other man,
with only one head,

00:01:29,794 --> 00:01:32,416
with two hands,

00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,198
and with a troubled heart.

00:01:34,198 --> 00:01:35,333
Objection.

00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:36,414
Is there a point here,
Your Honor?

00:01:36,414 --> 00:01:38,903
Mr. Haskell, I advise you
to let your attorney

00:01:38,903 --> 00:01:41,138
do the talking.
But I object to that,
Your Honor.

00:01:41,138 --> 00:01:43,774
The jury needs to see
the real Nate Haskell;

00:01:43,774 --> 00:01:47,278
the vulnerable little boy who
was sadistically abused

00:01:47,278 --> 00:01:49,246
by an alcoholic father.

00:01:49,246 --> 00:01:51,410
For the record...

00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:54,752
that traumatized child
still trembles in me.

00:01:54,752 --> 00:01:57,355
I know there's some
in this courtroom

00:01:57,355 --> 00:02:01,125
who can relate to my torment.

00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:03,961
Unfortunately, Your Honor, my
attorney is not one of them.

00:02:03,961 --> 00:02:05,296
You know,
he doesn't even like me.

00:02:05,296 --> 00:02:07,198
Your Honor!
The court
has appointed him.

00:02:07,198 --> 00:02:09,967
But I, I would like
to un-appoint him.

00:02:09,967 --> 00:02:12,036
See how he shies away from me.

00:02:12,036 --> 00:02:13,412
How can I trust him?

00:02:13,412 --> 00:02:15,373
The only one who can speak
for Nate Haskell

00:02:15,373 --> 00:02:16,374
is Nate Haskell.

00:02:16,374 --> 00:02:17,775
JUDGE:
Mr. Haskell.

00:02:17,775 --> 00:02:19,844
Are you asking
to represent yourself?

00:02:19,844 --> 00:02:21,846
I believe the legal term
is pro per, Your Honor.

00:02:21,846 --> 00:02:25,216
JUDGE: For the record,
I think you're making a mistake.

00:02:25,216 --> 00:02:26,317
But...

00:02:26,317 --> 00:02:27,411
(gavel bangs)
so ordered.

00:02:27,411 --> 00:02:29,987
Let the record show
that Mr. Haskell

00:02:29,987 --> 00:02:31,417
is now proceeding pro per.

00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:34,413
But, I warn you,
Mr. Haskell,

00:02:34,413 --> 00:02:36,417
there will be
no delays in this trial.

00:02:36,417 --> 00:02:39,764
Oh, excellent, Your Honor.
Excellent.

00:02:39,764 --> 00:02:40,798
I say...

00:02:42,066 --> 00:02:44,301
Let's get it on. Hm?

00:02:44,301 --> 00:02:48,139
(gallery murmuring)

00:03:03,754 --> 00:03:07,158
(phone rings)

00:03:07,158 --> 00:03:08,726
Stokes.

00:03:08,726 --> 00:03:11,412
BOY:
You said you wanted
to be my friend.

00:03:11,412 --> 00:03:12,417
Yeah, who's this?

00:03:12,417 --> 00:03:13,417
You said you wouldn't

00:03:13,417 --> 00:03:14,965
let the cops kill my brother.

00:03:14,965 --> 00:03:16,901
And then you empty your gun
into him?

00:03:16,901 --> 00:03:19,937
Jason McCann?

00:03:19,937 --> 00:03:22,773
I should just let you die,
like you did Alex.

00:03:28,312 --> 00:03:30,411
How'd you get my number?

00:03:30,411 --> 00:03:31,411
Wait,

00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:32,817
they're coming. I gotta go.

00:03:32,817 --> 00:03:33,951
Whatever you do, don't go home.

00:03:33,951 --> 00:03:34,985
(hangs up)

00:03:43,294 --> 00:03:46,330
Control,
this is Charlie 0-5 Stokes.

00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,099
I'm at 922 Rose Avenue.

00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:50,067
You, uh,

00:03:50,067 --> 00:03:51,769
better get the bomb squad
out here.

00:03:54,972 --> 00:03:56,741
Code three.

BOMB SQUAD TECH:
M67 frag grenade in a can.

00:04:41,285 --> 00:04:43,788
Pretty simple
booby-trap.

00:04:43,788 --> 00:04:45,990
Kill zone up to five meters.

00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:48,793
All right, Stokes.

00:04:48,793 --> 00:04:51,295
Back up, slowly.

00:04:51,295 --> 00:04:52,413
Might be more surprises.

00:04:52,413 --> 00:04:53,898
I hope not.

00:04:53,898 --> 00:04:56,300
I'm already eight lives down...

00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,301
if you know what I mean.

00:04:57,301 --> 00:04:58,869
I hear you, brother.

00:05:04,411 --> 00:05:06,415
(relieved sigh)

00:05:06,415 --> 00:05:09,246
(siren wails)

00:05:09,246 --> 00:05:11,782
Right this way.
Get off me! I'm all right.

00:05:11,782 --> 00:05:13,413
Yes, sir.

00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:14,418
BOMB TECH (over radio):
No sign of forced entry.

00:05:14,418 --> 00:05:16,053
But we'll play it safe.
We'll sweep

00:05:16,053 --> 00:05:18,122
the rest of the house
for any more explosives.

00:05:18,122 --> 00:05:19,416
BOMB SQUAD TECH:
Okay!

00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:21,409
I safetied the device.

00:05:21,409 --> 00:05:23,414
I'll blow it
and I'll send you what's left.

00:05:23,414 --> 00:05:25,763
Don't forget the trip-wire knot.

00:05:25,763 --> 00:05:27,413
BOMB SQUAD TECH:
I'll send it in the package.

00:05:27,413 --> 00:05:28,799
You can bronze it for Stokes.

00:05:28,799 --> 00:05:31,413
Along with this piece
of his wall.

00:05:31,413 --> 00:05:33,413
"Sic semper tyrannis."

00:05:33,413 --> 00:05:35,412
"Thus always to tyrants."

00:05:35,412 --> 00:05:37,074
Slogan for every whack job.

00:05:37,074 --> 00:05:40,418
They came to my house!
That kid has my private number!

00:05:40,418 --> 00:05:42,411
I tell you what-- if they're
looking for a fight,

00:05:42,411 --> 00:05:43,414
they found one.

00:05:43,414 --> 00:05:45,216
I'm not afraid to die.
Let's see if they are.

00:05:45,216 --> 00:05:46,250
Nick, come on now.

00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,118
I'm serious!
I know you're serious.

00:05:48,118 --> 00:05:49,413
Just dial it down.

00:05:49,413 --> 00:05:51,922
Come on.

00:05:51,922 --> 00:05:53,057
Did you see anything?

00:05:53,057 --> 00:05:55,414
I don't know.

00:05:55,414 --> 00:05:56,894
There was a maroon van.

00:05:56,894 --> 00:05:58,796
Wi-with, uh, uh,
an extended cab

00:05:58,796 --> 00:06:01,298
on the roof-- you know?-- I-I
didn't think anything of it.

00:06:01,298 --> 00:06:02,733
Neighbors saw that
same van; it's gone.

00:06:02,733 --> 00:06:04,969
You think they were
sitting in that van,

00:06:04,969 --> 00:06:07,413
waiting for me to blow up?
Huh?

00:06:07,413 --> 00:06:09,139
You said that Jason McCann
called you?

00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:12,209
Yeah, I mean, I think
that kid saved my life/

00:06:12,209 --> 00:06:13,344
Nick, that kid
should be in jail.

00:06:13,344 --> 00:06:14,745
He helped blow up
a police funeral.

00:06:14,745 --> 00:06:15,880
Come on.
WILLOWS:
Yeah, the D.A.

00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,416
couldn't make
the case back then.

00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:18,416
Now, all of a sudden,
you've got a bomb

00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:19,750
that shows up
on your doorstep,

00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,253
and he calls you...
just in time.

00:06:22,253 --> 00:06:25,289
No, it's no coincidence.
Hail his ass in to PD.

00:06:32,417 --> 00:06:33,797
Thank you, Dr. Langston.

00:06:33,797 --> 00:06:36,300
No further questions.

00:06:38,413 --> 00:06:41,805
Well, Ray, shall we...

00:06:41,805 --> 00:06:44,208
go back to the moment
I stabbed you?

00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:46,844
Will you describe
for the court

00:06:46,844 --> 00:06:50,416
and me...
how it felt...

00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:53,350
when I plunged my shank
into your kidney?

00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:55,152
PROSECUTOR: Objection!
Irrelevant. Defense is

00:06:55,152 --> 00:06:56,754
indulging in gratuitous sadism.

00:06:56,754 --> 00:06:57,855
Question goes to state
of mind, Your Honor,

00:06:57,855 --> 00:07:00,412
which is key to my defense.

00:07:00,412 --> 00:07:01,892
Overruled.

00:07:01,892 --> 00:07:03,727
I'll allow it, for now.

00:07:03,727 --> 00:07:06,416
Well, Ray, how did it feel?

00:07:07,765 --> 00:07:11,068
Painful.
Can you be
more specific?

00:07:11,068 --> 00:07:13,410
More... poetic?

00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:15,039
You're a published writer, Ray.

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,774
Describe the
sensation

00:07:16,774 --> 00:07:18,909
when my shank
first pierced your skin.

00:07:22,179 --> 00:07:23,180
Sharp.

00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,983
White-hot.
And after that...

00:07:25,983 --> 00:07:28,416
what did you feel?

00:07:29,887 --> 00:07:30,988
(gasps)

00:07:33,413 --> 00:07:36,260
Lightheaded. Very lightheaded.
Oh...

00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,412
And-and-and
as you laid down then,

00:07:38,412 --> 00:07:40,413
and your life was
draining away,

00:07:40,413 --> 00:07:42,833
you gazed into my eyes.

00:07:44,935 --> 00:07:46,412
<i>What did you feel then, Ray?</i>

00:07:46,412 --> 00:07:47,417
Disbelief.

00:07:47,417 --> 00:07:49,206
That's a thought.
Give me a feeling.

00:07:52,242 --> 00:07:53,413
Fear.

00:07:53,413 --> 00:07:55,145
What?

00:07:55,145 --> 00:07:56,246
Fear.

00:07:56,246 --> 00:07:58,015
You felt what?
I was afraid

00:07:58,015 --> 00:07:59,883
I was going to die.

00:07:59,883 --> 00:08:01,352
Yes.

00:08:01,352 --> 00:08:04,409
A perfectly normal
human reaction

00:08:04,409 --> 00:08:06,256
to a horrific experience.

00:08:06,256 --> 00:08:09,159
Objection!
Sustained.
The defendant

00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:11,795
will confine himself
to questioning the witness.

00:08:11,795 --> 00:08:13,414
Boring, but fine.

00:08:13,414 --> 00:08:15,416
Ray?

00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:17,935
When I look at you,

00:08:17,935 --> 00:08:20,971
when I see the anguish
I caused you,

00:08:20,971 --> 00:08:23,410
I feel... nothing.

00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:24,908
Objection!

00:08:24,908 --> 00:08:27,011
Defense is testifying!
HASKELL:
Don't you think

00:08:27,011 --> 00:08:30,247
I wantto feel something, Ray?
The emotions

00:08:30,247 --> 00:08:32,916
that a normal human being feels?

00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:36,220
Look at that: Steady,
calm, emotionless.

00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,721
That's just not right!

00:08:37,721 --> 00:08:39,256
Your Honor!
This is outrageous.

00:08:39,256 --> 00:08:41,859
Sustained. Strike
the defendant's last statement.

00:08:41,859 --> 00:08:43,416
The jury
is instructed

00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:44,862
to disregard it.

00:08:44,862 --> 00:08:46,417
No further questions,
Your Honor.

00:08:53,409 --> 00:08:55,873
SIDLE: Bomber used a Z-type
bowline on the grenade?

00:08:55,873 --> 00:08:57,775
Makes him a lefty.
Most people

00:08:57,775 --> 00:08:59,209
don't tie anything
more complicated

00:08:59,209 --> 00:09:00,415
than their shoes.

00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:03,213
Less than 15% of the
population are lefties.

00:09:03,213 --> 00:09:05,349
He added a half hitch
to the end.

00:09:05,349 --> 00:09:06,417
You know, it's weird.

00:09:06,417 --> 00:09:08,410
It's the same signature
that Alex McCann used

00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:10,416
on the bombs at the police
funeral, and he's dead.

00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,415
Well, we know
he wasn't acting alone.

00:09:12,415 --> 00:09:15,412
What about his brother Jason.
Maybe he's a lefty?

00:09:15,412 --> 00:09:16,414
Let's check LIMS.

00:09:26,136 --> 00:09:29,206
Mm... Doesn't say.

00:09:29,206 --> 00:09:30,307
Well, we're bringing him in.

00:09:30,307 --> 00:09:31,375
I'm going to call Nick,
and tell him to get

00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:33,411
his autograph,
and maybe we'll get lucky.

00:09:37,281 --> 00:09:38,282
Hey.

00:09:38,282 --> 00:09:41,409
Hey.

00:09:44,254 --> 00:09:46,417
(sighs heavily)

00:09:46,417 --> 00:09:48,125
It's a pretty nasty bruise.
How'd you get that?

00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,827
I fell.

00:09:49,827 --> 00:09:51,028
Mm.

00:09:58,235 --> 00:10:00,337
I want to thank you
for calling me when you did,

00:10:00,337 --> 00:10:01,417
or I wouldn't be here right now.

00:10:01,417 --> 00:10:04,411
That took a lot of guts.

00:10:04,411 --> 00:10:05,413
I'm sure there's some people
out there

00:10:05,413 --> 00:10:07,418
who didn't
appreciate it.

00:10:07,418 --> 00:10:08,745
Probably the same
people who...

00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,915
put a grenade in my yard.

00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,852
You give me a name...

00:10:14,852 --> 00:10:16,253
and I can help you.

00:10:18,288 --> 00:10:19,923
I can't.

00:10:19,923 --> 00:10:21,792
They will kill me.

00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:28,866
Dr. Huxbee.

00:10:28,866 --> 00:10:30,412
Just the guy
I wanted to talk to.

00:10:30,412 --> 00:10:32,417
I'm Jason McCann's
legal guardian.

00:10:32,417 --> 00:10:34,271
I heard you pulled him
out of school.

00:10:34,271 --> 00:10:36,173
Is he under arrest?
No.

00:10:36,173 --> 00:10:37,411
Then he's coming with me.

00:10:37,411 --> 00:10:38,417
Let's have a little chat first.

00:10:38,417 --> 00:10:40,077
We have nothing to talk about.

00:10:40,077 --> 00:10:42,412
Oh, you'd be surprised.
Come on.

00:10:44,982 --> 00:10:47,784
Oh, I saw Jason when he came in.

00:10:47,784 --> 00:10:49,786
Pretty nasty shiner the kid has.

00:10:49,786 --> 00:10:51,412
So what happened?

00:10:51,412 --> 00:10:52,723
He mouthed off, so you laid

00:10:52,723 --> 00:10:54,358
a little old-fashioned
discipline on him?

00:10:54,358 --> 00:10:55,826
Jason fell...

00:10:55,826 --> 00:10:57,411
skateboarding.

00:10:57,411 --> 00:11:00,197
Yeah. Sure.

00:11:00,197 --> 00:11:02,065
I checked out your file.

00:11:02,065 --> 00:11:03,416
Before you got your PhD
in political theory,

00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:04,835
you were in the Coast Guard.

00:11:04,835 --> 00:11:06,417
Must have tied a few

00:11:06,417 --> 00:11:08,417
bowline hitches
back then, huh?

00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:10,409
Is that where you
learned to make bombs?

00:11:10,409 --> 00:11:13,143
I told you before,
I'm opposed to violence.
Right.

00:11:13,143 --> 00:11:14,878
You just make 'em,
you don't plant 'em.

00:11:14,878 --> 00:11:15,979
That's too dangerous,

00:11:15,979 --> 00:11:17,314
too much shrapnel
in the air.

00:11:17,314 --> 00:11:18,849
Do I need to call
my attorney?

00:11:18,849 --> 00:11:20,851
I came for Jason.

00:11:20,851 --> 00:11:22,853
Just sign this release.

00:11:22,853 --> 00:11:25,418
Then you can go back to your
public speaking engagements

00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:27,412
where you trash
this country

00:11:27,412 --> 00:11:30,727
that gives you the freedom
to spew all your crap.

00:11:35,265 --> 00:11:38,001
STOKES:
<i>I know you're between a rock</i>

00:11:38,001 --> 00:11:41,004
and a hard place here,
but I'll protect you.

00:11:41,004 --> 00:11:43,006
Like you protected
my brother, right?
Hey,

00:11:43,006 --> 00:11:44,418
your brother didn't
give me a choice, man.

00:11:44,418 --> 00:11:46,276
You think that
makes it hurt any less?

00:11:46,276 --> 00:11:48,414
HUXBEE:
Jason.

00:11:49,746 --> 00:11:51,782
Let's go.

00:11:55,018 --> 00:11:57,417
Hey, you still have my number.

00:12:08,966 --> 00:12:11,418
He seems scared, but
I can't read him, Jim.

00:12:11,418 --> 00:12:13,337
You shot his brother.

00:12:13,337 --> 00:12:16,073
Why would he want
to save<i>yourlife?</i>

00:12:16,073 --> 00:12:17,274
Huh?

00:12:18,842 --> 00:12:20,711
Grenade fragments
had a story to tell.

00:12:20,711 --> 00:12:22,813
Found trace amounts
of benzyl benzoate.

00:12:22,813 --> 00:12:25,412
Well, that's an acetone;
it's not in grenades.
Exactly.

00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:27,411
So if Nick's grenade
were military issue,

00:12:27,411 --> 00:12:29,411
it would have been
filled with Comp-B.

00:12:29,411 --> 00:12:31,221
Acetone-- that's one
of the ingredients

00:12:31,221 --> 00:12:33,418
in triacetone-
triperoxide, TATP.

00:12:33,418 --> 00:12:35,416
That's the same explosive
that Jason McCann's brother

00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:36,960
used to make pipe bombs.

00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,196
So somebody is filling

00:12:39,196 --> 00:12:40,797
empty grenades
instead of pipes.

00:12:40,797 --> 00:12:42,833
Well, you can buy empty grenades
as commemoratives

00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:44,801
and fill them with
any boom you want.

00:12:44,801 --> 00:12:47,104
Hey. Remember how
Huxbee was bragging

00:12:47,104 --> 00:12:50,413
about living off the grid
and ditching his plastic
and all that?

00:12:50,413 --> 00:12:53,176
Yeah.
Well, looks
like some bank

00:12:53,176 --> 00:12:56,079
made him an offer for
a low-interest credit card

00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,181
even he
couldn't refuse.

00:12:58,181 --> 00:13:00,183
WILLOWS:
Guy's become a shopaholic.

00:13:00,183 --> 00:13:01,351
HODGES: Retail
therapy can be

00:13:01,351 --> 00:13:02,886
very effective
in relieving

00:13:02,886 --> 00:13:04,410
that Armageddon stress.

00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:06,223
Well, Huxbee's not buying
a lot of sterno and camo,

00:13:06,223 --> 00:13:08,415
but he did buy
serious quantities

00:13:08,415 --> 00:13:10,060
of acetone and pool acid.

00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:12,062
Maybe he was looking to start
his own Armageddon.

00:13:23,415 --> 00:13:25,413
Thanks for coming.
Yeah, I hope
we're not wasting

00:13:25,413 --> 00:13:28,011
your time here, Kip.
You kidding?
I live for this.

00:13:28,011 --> 00:13:30,414
So, Dr. Huxbee's
old landlord didn't
agree with his politics,

00:13:30,414 --> 00:13:32,849
so he booted him out
of the old meeting hall,

00:13:32,849 --> 00:13:34,718
and Huxbee signed
a new lease here.

00:13:34,718 --> 00:13:38,355
WILLOWS: Credit cards, leases--
gets the doc back on the grid.

00:13:38,355 --> 00:13:40,415
We got an R.O. on this truck?

00:13:40,415 --> 00:13:42,926
Yeah, it's Huxbee's--
so he must be inside.

00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,411
Dr. Huxbee?

00:13:45,411 --> 00:13:47,130
LVPD. We have a warrant.

00:13:49,418 --> 00:13:50,901
(calls):
Huxbee?

00:13:50,901 --> 00:13:53,413
We need to talk.

00:13:53,413 --> 00:13:55,806
Got some blood here.

00:14:02,913 --> 00:14:04,416
WILLOWS:
It's Huxbee.

00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,414
He's dead.

00:14:11,414 --> 00:14:13,223
Guy just sprung
Jason McCann from PD;

00:14:13,223 --> 00:14:14,411
now he's dead?

00:14:14,411 --> 00:14:15,416
Where's Jason?

00:14:18,228 --> 00:14:19,930
WILLOWS:
You know, this scene

00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:21,412
looks a little too familiar.

00:14:21,412 --> 00:14:24,067
Dead body in the middle
of a room?

00:14:25,414 --> 00:14:27,003
KIP:
Body's wired.

00:14:27,003 --> 00:14:28,071
Are you kidding me?

00:14:28,071 --> 00:14:29,306
I don't see any explosives.

00:14:31,341 --> 00:14:33,043
(power generator whines,
activating)

00:14:33,043 --> 00:14:34,077
Oh, crap.

00:14:42,252 --> 00:14:43,409
That can't be good.

00:14:43,409 --> 00:14:44,321
You think?

00:14:44,321 --> 00:14:45,822
VARTANN:
What is it with you?

00:14:45,822 --> 00:14:47,224
You some kind of
a bomb magnet?

00:14:47,224 --> 00:14:49,418
All right, guys,
let's get out of here.

00:14:49,418 --> 00:14:51,417
The whole place
might be rigged.

00:14:51,417 --> 00:14:53,830
Retrace your steps.

00:14:57,234 --> 00:14:59,069
WILLOWS:
Hang on.

00:14:59,069 --> 00:15:01,371
What is that?
Looks like some kind of sensor.

00:15:02,806 --> 00:15:03,807
Yeah.

00:15:05,242 --> 00:15:07,711
You're not
gonna like this.

00:15:13,414 --> 00:15:15,719
One door in, one door out.

00:15:15,719 --> 00:15:18,121
We're not going anywhere.

00:15:26,196 --> 00:15:28,131
Control, KA-135.
We have a 445

00:15:28,131 --> 00:15:30,734
at 3027 Rosemont Boulevard.

00:15:30,734 --> 00:15:32,736
Control, KA-13...

00:15:32,736 --> 00:15:34,418
(radio static)
Radio's dead.

00:15:34,418 --> 00:15:35,412
What?

00:15:35,412 --> 00:15:36,740
Phone, too.

00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,411
Seriously?
Must be jamming
the signals.

00:15:38,411 --> 00:15:39,943
Fantastic.
We're on our own.

00:15:39,943 --> 00:15:43,313
Well... come on, man,
you're the rock star here.

00:15:43,313 --> 00:15:45,015
Time to start playing,
bud. Let's go.

00:15:45,015 --> 00:15:47,017
Photo-sensor chip
under the DB armed

00:15:47,017 --> 00:15:48,185
the bombs and lasers.

00:15:48,185 --> 00:15:49,415
We break any
of those beams,

00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:51,418
that much C-4 is gonna
take us all out.

00:15:51,418 --> 00:15:55,225
We got to diffuse this bad boy.

00:15:55,225 --> 00:15:56,193
WILLOWS:
Yeah.

00:15:56,193 --> 00:15:58,195
How are<i>wegoing to get to it?</i>

00:15:58,195 --> 00:15:59,416
KIP: I'm still
working on it.

00:16:03,033 --> 00:16:05,936
Keyless car entry
receiver circuit.

00:16:05,936 --> 00:16:08,104
Fob transmitter's
probably connected

00:16:08,104 --> 00:16:09,411
to the lasers.

00:16:09,411 --> 00:16:10,740
That clock say

00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,375
14 minutes?
That's a lifetime.

00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:13,844
VARTANN:
To disarm it, or is that

00:16:13,844 --> 00:16:14,945
just what we've got left?

00:16:14,945 --> 00:16:17,747
Both.

00:16:17,747 --> 00:16:21,718
Dr. Corey,
two weeks ago you brought

00:16:21,718 --> 00:16:26,410
a mobile MRI machine
to Ely State Prison

00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:29,259
to conduct a test on me.
Yes. I...

00:16:29,259 --> 00:16:31,413
scanned your brain
while you were shown

00:16:31,413 --> 00:16:33,864
a series of crime photographs.

00:16:33,864 --> 00:16:36,366
HASKELL:
<i>Describe the photos.</i>

00:16:36,366 --> 00:16:38,368
COREY:
<i>They were graphic, uh,</i>

00:16:38,368 --> 00:16:39,903
<i>extremely violent.</i>

00:16:39,903 --> 00:16:44,040
<i>Images of mutilated</i>
<i>and dismembered bodies.</i>

00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,843
What happens, Doctor,
to the average person's brain

00:16:46,843 --> 00:16:49,112
when they're shown such images?

00:16:49,112 --> 00:16:50,247
This...

00:16:50,247 --> 00:16:53,049
is the orbital cortex.

00:16:53,049 --> 00:16:56,286
It governs, uh,
moral decision making,

00:16:56,286 --> 00:16:59,089
aggression, impulse control.

00:16:59,089 --> 00:17:00,724
It's lit up like
a Christmas tree.

00:17:00,724 --> 00:17:02,359
It's so beautiful, Doctor.

00:17:02,359 --> 00:17:04,417
COREY:
Well, it's because
it's being stimulated.

00:17:04,417 --> 00:17:05,762
Clearly,

00:17:05,762 --> 00:17:08,164
the, uh, subject
was deeply disturbed

00:17:08,164 --> 00:17:09,299
by the images.

00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:11,409
HASKELL:
And how does this compare

00:17:11,409 --> 00:17:12,769
to a scan of...

00:17:12,769 --> 00:17:14,411
<i>myorbital cortex?</i>

00:17:14,411 --> 00:17:16,072
COREY:
Well...

00:17:16,072 --> 00:17:17,416
as you can see,

00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:20,310
yours is pitch black;
there is no activity.

00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,410
Your orbital cortex

00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:25,348
is profoundly
impaired.

00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:32,188
Doctor, do you know what caused
this... this defect?

00:17:32,188 --> 00:17:33,410
You possess

00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:35,416
a genetic mutation:

00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:38,128
the Monoamine

00:17:38,128 --> 00:17:42,232
Oxidase A, or MAO-A gene.

00:17:42,232 --> 00:17:44,414
Otherwise known as

00:17:44,414 --> 00:17:46,369
the warrior gene,

00:17:46,369 --> 00:17:48,416
for its association
with aggression.

00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:51,107
HASKELL:
Doctor, what is the significance

00:17:51,107 --> 00:17:53,409
of this warrior gene
for someone like me?

00:17:53,409 --> 00:17:54,911
COREY:
Well, according

00:17:54,911 --> 00:17:58,048
to numerous studies,
if you suffered severe

00:17:58,048 --> 00:18:01,318
childhood abuse
and possessed this gene,

00:18:01,318 --> 00:18:02,852
it increases your chances

00:18:02,852 --> 00:18:05,288
of committing
a violent crime by...

00:18:05,288 --> 00:18:07,924
four hundred percent.

00:18:10,327 --> 00:18:11,962
Doctor, you complete me,

00:18:11,962 --> 00:18:15,065
or at least you complete
my understanding of me.

00:18:15,065 --> 00:18:16,132
Objection.
I know,

00:18:16,132 --> 00:18:17,233
counsel is testifying.

00:18:17,233 --> 00:18:18,368
Sustained, sustained.

00:18:18,368 --> 00:18:19,412
JUDGE:
Mr. Haskell,

00:18:19,412 --> 00:18:21,237
I've given you
a lot of leeway

00:18:21,237 --> 00:18:22,305
because you're pro per,

00:18:22,305 --> 00:18:24,414
but if you try to
do my job again,

00:18:24,414 --> 00:18:26,109
I will hold you
in contempt.

00:18:26,109 --> 00:18:28,712
Mea culpa, Your Honor.

00:18:28,712 --> 00:18:30,347
So, Dr. Corey,

00:18:30,347 --> 00:18:32,115
it is your
expert opinion

00:18:32,115 --> 00:18:35,416
that I cannot be held
responsible for my actions,

00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:36,853
for any of them?

00:18:36,853 --> 00:18:38,188
That is correct.

00:18:38,188 --> 00:18:40,023
HASKELL:
So it is true what they say,

00:18:40,023 --> 00:18:41,157
that I am a monster,

00:18:41,157 --> 00:18:43,226
<i>buta monster</i>

00:18:43,226 --> 00:18:45,411
made of biology
beyond my control.

00:18:45,411 --> 00:18:47,797
So convicting me
of attempted murder

00:18:47,797 --> 00:18:49,412
would be like
convicting a blind man

00:18:49,412 --> 00:18:51,413
of being unable to see.

00:18:51,413 --> 00:18:53,303
Who's the real victim here?!

00:18:56,072 --> 00:18:58,808
(sobbing):
Who's the real victim?

00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:03,409
KIP:
Bomb out of reach,
clock facing us--

00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:05,281
they want us to see how
much time we have left,

00:19:05,281 --> 00:19:06,418
force our hand.

00:19:06,418 --> 00:19:08,284
Yeah, that's 'cause
they're watching us.

00:19:08,284 --> 00:19:10,954
They want
to see us sweat.

00:19:12,922 --> 00:19:15,358
Yeah, here we go.

00:19:20,964 --> 00:19:22,413
WILLOWS:
They've been a step ahead

00:19:22,413 --> 00:19:24,868
of us this
whole time.
Yep.

00:19:24,868 --> 00:19:27,409
Well... they want
to play with lasers,

00:19:27,409 --> 00:19:28,738
I'll give 'em lasers.

00:19:31,775 --> 00:19:33,411
(electronic crackle)

00:19:33,411 --> 00:19:34,417
(sighs)

00:19:36,713 --> 00:19:38,982
All right,
guys, ideas?

00:19:38,982 --> 00:19:41,184
Well, we can't go
through the beams,

00:19:41,184 --> 00:19:42,752
so maybe we go over 'em.

00:19:42,752 --> 00:19:45,415
Yeah, there's plenty
of pallets and lumber.
Yeah.

00:19:45,415 --> 00:19:47,413
Yeah, enough to build
a stairway to Heaven.

00:19:57,901 --> 00:19:59,411
(loud popping)

00:19:59,411 --> 00:20:01,771
WILLOWS:
Lou!

00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,415
(groaning)
You don't want
to be next.

00:20:05,415 --> 00:20:09,012
That goes for you,
too, Stokes.

00:20:13,783 --> 00:20:16,152
KIP:
Nine-mil cartridges
set into the wood.

00:20:16,152 --> 00:20:17,411
Nails as firing pins.

00:20:17,411 --> 00:20:19,289
Very smart.

00:20:19,289 --> 00:20:21,057
Yeah, smarter than me.

00:20:21,057 --> 00:20:23,411
All right, you're good

00:20:23,411 --> 00:20:25,729
along that line.

00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:28,732
It's bad,

00:20:28,732 --> 00:20:31,101
isn't it?

00:20:31,101 --> 00:20:32,969
(gasps)

00:20:32,969 --> 00:20:35,105
He may have nicked an artery.

00:20:35,105 --> 00:20:37,140
I'm gonna apply
some pressure.

00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,275
Okay.
It's gonna hurt.

00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:42,245
(grunts)
Sorry.

00:20:42,245 --> 00:20:44,013
God, I hate it
when you're right.

00:20:45,409 --> 00:20:47,717
We want to get out here,
we better start stacking.

00:20:47,717 --> 00:20:50,415
All right, you guys go for it.
I'm gonna stay with Lou.

00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:51,921
Careful what you pick up.

00:20:51,921 --> 00:20:53,089
Yeah, copy that.

00:21:02,232 --> 00:21:05,417
You should find
more compassion in
your heart for Nate.

00:21:05,417 --> 00:21:07,418
The man has a disease.
I'm sorry, who are you?

00:21:07,418 --> 00:21:09,839
I'm Vivian, Nate's fiancée.

00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:11,241
His one true love.

00:21:11,241 --> 00:21:13,416
I see. Did Nate give
you that pendant?

00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:16,146
Yes.
I wonder if

00:21:16,146 --> 00:21:17,814
you understand the
significance of it.

00:21:17,814 --> 00:21:20,216
Oh, Nate's a very spiritual man.
I was referring

00:21:20,216 --> 00:21:23,286
to his first two victims,
Joel Steiner and Tiffany Cohen.

00:21:23,286 --> 00:21:24,414
They both wore

00:21:24,414 --> 00:21:26,055
identical Stars of David.

00:21:26,055 --> 00:21:27,412
They were two
young people

00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:29,893
very much in love, just
starting out in life,

00:21:29,893 --> 00:21:31,060
when he kidnapped them,

00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:33,029
murdered Joel, so
that he could rape

00:21:33,029 --> 00:21:34,798
and torture Tiffany
at his leisure.

00:21:34,798 --> 00:21:35,999
Well, you heard that expert;

00:21:35,999 --> 00:21:37,734
he's not responsible
for his actions.

00:21:37,734 --> 00:21:41,371
Besides, the love of
a good woman can change any man.
Now, why don't

00:21:41,371 --> 00:21:43,410
you tell that to the
seven women that we found

00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:45,141
buried under
his floorboards?

00:21:45,141 --> 00:21:47,343
Vivian.

00:21:47,343 --> 00:21:49,112
Join the prayer circle.

00:21:56,152 --> 00:21:58,788
I see you've met
the Brides of Haskell.

00:21:58,788 --> 00:22:03,193
They're all wearing
identical Stars of David.

00:22:03,193 --> 00:22:05,228
Well, serial killers
have groupies, Ray.

00:22:05,228 --> 00:22:08,414
Well, they may not be
the only ones listening
to this psychobabble.

00:22:08,414 --> 00:22:10,133
You should have seen
the jury listening

00:22:10,133 --> 00:22:11,734
to his expert witness,
this Dr. Corey.

00:22:11,734 --> 00:22:14,771
Haskell's going to try
and use the MAO-A defense

00:22:14,771 --> 00:22:17,240
to get all of his
convictions overturned, Jim.

00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,042
That's a long shot, Ray.

00:22:19,042 --> 00:22:21,244
You heard of Willie Sutton,
bank robber, right?

00:22:21,244 --> 00:22:23,079
Sentenced to over 100 years.

00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:25,048
Studied civil rights
law in jail.

00:22:25,048 --> 00:22:26,916
Got all of his
convictions overturned.

00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:28,718
He died a free man.

00:22:28,718 --> 00:22:30,019
Captain Brass?

00:22:30,019 --> 00:22:32,021
Ready for testimony.

00:22:33,189 --> 00:22:36,259
Okay, my turn on the hot seat.

00:22:36,259 --> 00:22:39,229
See you later.

00:22:39,229 --> 00:22:41,898
Hey, stay with me.

00:22:41,898 --> 00:22:43,409
We're gonna get you out of here.

00:22:43,409 --> 00:22:45,001
We're all gonna get out of here.

00:22:47,103 --> 00:22:49,105
STOKES:
All right, Kip.

00:22:49,105 --> 00:22:50,411
Once you're in, you're in.

00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:52,775
You ready, wild man?

00:22:52,775 --> 00:22:55,011
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:22:55,011 --> 00:22:57,415
If I were you,
I'd stick that landing, bud.

00:23:02,018 --> 00:23:03,887
(gasps)

00:23:04,954 --> 00:23:07,757
You're good.

00:23:07,757 --> 00:23:09,759
You're good.

00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,762
(sighs)

00:23:14,964 --> 00:23:16,966
All right.

00:23:20,416 --> 00:23:21,938
Clock's ticking.

00:23:24,007 --> 00:23:27,043
Big capacitors.

00:23:27,043 --> 00:23:29,312
Just a come-on.

00:23:29,312 --> 00:23:30,947
You know, I don't think Huxbee

00:23:30,947 --> 00:23:32,949
or Jason McCann
pulled this off.

00:23:32,949 --> 00:23:34,413
You might want to
find some shelter.

00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,119
All we got is plywood.

00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:37,411
That's no good against C-4?

00:23:37,411 --> 00:23:39,088
It can't hurt.

00:23:39,088 --> 00:23:40,757
Yeah. All right.

00:23:40,757 --> 00:23:43,760
I'll be right back.

00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,411
Hey.
Hey. We got
to get him to cover.

00:23:45,411 --> 00:23:46,417
(Lou groans)

00:23:46,417 --> 00:23:48,416
Can you sit
up for me, Lou?
Okay.

00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:49,866
I got it.
Yeah?

00:23:49,866 --> 00:23:52,135
Aah!

00:23:52,135 --> 00:23:53,411
Piece of cake.

00:23:53,411 --> 00:23:55,038
(all groaning)

00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:56,205
(panting)

00:23:56,205 --> 00:23:57,416
Watch that.
(whispers)

00:23:57,416 --> 00:23:58,808
Stay strong, Lou.

00:23:58,808 --> 00:24:00,417
(both panting)

00:24:00,417 --> 00:24:01,417
Ah, hell.

00:24:01,417 --> 00:24:02,410
What? What?

00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:03,417
Mercury switch.

00:24:03,417 --> 00:24:05,414
That doesn't sound good.

00:24:05,414 --> 00:24:07,409
Anti-tampering device.

00:24:07,409 --> 00:24:10,253
Works on gravity.

00:24:10,253 --> 00:24:11,888
Normally I'd cut the main power,

00:24:11,888 --> 00:24:14,090
but this baby's got
a collapsing circuit.

00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:15,412
Translation?

00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:19,929
I cut the power lead,
it triggers the bomb.

00:24:19,929 --> 00:24:21,998
I've got to cut
these two conductors separately,

00:24:21,998 --> 00:24:23,414
make sure the wires don't touch.

00:24:23,414 --> 00:24:24,734
STOKES:
All right.

00:24:24,734 --> 00:24:26,035
You get to cover.

00:24:26,035 --> 00:24:27,413
Hell, no, man.
I'm staying right here with you.

00:24:27,413 --> 00:24:29,973
Ah, you're the wild man.

00:24:31,412 --> 00:24:32,418
Less than a minute.

00:24:32,418 --> 00:24:34,210
Plenty of time.

00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,982
45 seconds.

00:24:45,088 --> 00:24:47,414
(grunts)

00:24:47,414 --> 00:24:48,891
First cut.

00:24:48,891 --> 00:24:50,409
(sighs)

00:24:54,931 --> 00:24:57,900
Second cut.

00:25:00,413 --> 00:25:01,938
(sighs)

00:25:05,775 --> 00:25:07,143
(whirring off)

00:25:07,143 --> 00:25:10,146
(sighs)

00:25:10,146 --> 00:25:11,418
It stopped.

00:25:11,418 --> 00:25:13,249
I hate to
disappoint you, Stokes,

00:25:13,249 --> 00:25:16,319
but you're not dying today.

00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:17,720
(laughs)

00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,922
Damn!

00:25:19,922 --> 00:25:21,357
Good job.

00:25:21,357 --> 00:25:22,792
Let's get him
to a hospital.

00:25:22,792 --> 00:25:24,794
You're my hero, man.

00:25:24,794 --> 00:25:26,763
(sighs)

00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:29,298
He got it.

00:25:29,298 --> 00:25:31,416
He got it. We're good.
We're good, Lou.

00:25:31,416 --> 00:25:33,302
Come here.
It's all right
Yeah.

00:25:33,302 --> 00:25:36,906
(generator whines,
powering up)

00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:40,376
Get down!

00:25:50,418 --> 00:25:52,418
(sirens wailing)

00:26:04,067 --> 00:26:06,202
Over here.

00:26:09,412 --> 00:26:11,414
I got three people down.

00:26:11,414 --> 00:26:13,142
One female

00:26:13,142 --> 00:26:15,178
in a CSI vest. Requesting
two additional paramedics.

00:26:15,178 --> 00:26:19,015
It's okay.
We're gonna get you out of here.

00:26:19,015 --> 00:26:22,251
One of my victims has
life-threatening injuries.

00:26:22,251 --> 00:26:25,321
So Nick and Catherine
are all right?

00:26:25,321 --> 00:26:27,323
And what about Vartann?

00:26:27,323 --> 00:26:30,193
Good. Listen, Greg, get the name
of his attending for me

00:26:30,193 --> 00:26:31,861
so I can follow up after.

00:26:31,861 --> 00:26:34,197
Oh, um, batter up.
Got to go.

00:26:34,197 --> 00:26:35,413
Thanks for
letting me know.

00:26:35,413 --> 00:26:37,333
PROSECUTOR :
<i>So, as a medical doctor,</i>

00:26:37,333 --> 00:26:40,410
what is your opinion
about Dr. Corey's theory

00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:43,139
that individuals
with the MAO-A gene

00:26:43,139 --> 00:26:45,415
are predisposed
to violence?

00:26:45,415 --> 00:26:48,044
It is my opinion
that it is utter nonsense.

00:26:48,044 --> 00:26:50,079
Sure, there have been
several studies

00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:52,148
that claim
that there's a link

00:26:52,148 --> 00:26:54,250
between the MAO-A gene
and violent behavior,

00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:56,085
but there are just
as many studies

00:26:56,085 --> 00:26:57,410
that dispute those findings.

00:26:57,410 --> 00:27:00,417
Dr. Corey's conclusions
are not neuroscience.

00:27:00,417 --> 00:27:01,991
They're neuromythology.

00:27:01,991 --> 00:27:03,411
PROSECUTOR:
Could you give
us an example?

00:27:03,411 --> 00:27:06,411
LANGSTON:
Alcoholics are
genetically predisposed

00:27:06,411 --> 00:27:08,418
to alcoholism,
which is a known disease,

00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:11,300
but we don't give drunks a pass
if they decide

00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:14,303
to get behind the wheel
of a vehicle and kill people.

00:27:14,303 --> 00:27:15,905
The law is interested
in whether or not

00:27:15,905 --> 00:27:17,073
a person understands
the difference

00:27:17,073 --> 00:27:19,775
between right and wrong,
and the defendant

00:27:19,775 --> 00:27:21,777
knows the difference
between right and wrong.

00:27:21,777 --> 00:27:23,146
He takes pleasure

00:27:23,146 --> 00:27:24,412
in committing sadistic crimes

00:27:24,412 --> 00:27:27,016
that he knows
are against the law.

00:27:27,016 --> 00:27:29,418
The fact that he has tried
to cover up those crimes

00:27:29,418 --> 00:27:32,413
is evidence
of his consciousness of guilt.

00:27:32,413 --> 00:27:35,158
No further questions,
Your Honor.

00:27:36,826 --> 00:27:39,228
I have nothing
but questions.

00:27:39,228 --> 00:27:45,101
Dr. Langston, are
you a psychiatrist?

00:27:45,101 --> 00:27:48,412
A neurologist?

00:27:48,412 --> 00:27:51,040
A geneticist?

00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,276
No. My field is
research pathology.

00:27:53,276 --> 00:27:57,412
Then you have no expertise
in this area at all, correct?

00:27:57,412 --> 00:27:59,715
No?

00:27:59,715 --> 00:28:01,250
You mean yes.

00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:06,412
You just testified to a complete
lack of credentials.

00:28:06,412 --> 00:28:09,413
So, on what would you
base any expertise?

00:28:09,413 --> 00:28:11,413
Personal experience.

00:28:13,162 --> 00:28:16,866
Like you, I was abused by
an alcoholic father as a child,

00:28:16,866 --> 00:28:20,136
and, like you,
I have the MAO-A gene.

00:28:22,371 --> 00:28:25,074
DNA isn't destiny.

00:28:25,074 --> 00:28:27,409
We're all responsible
for our own actions.

00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:31,280
I share the same gene
with you, Nate,

00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,412
but I've never murdered anyone.

00:28:32,412 --> 00:28:34,414
I take satisfaction

00:28:34,414 --> 00:28:36,018
in bringing justice
to victims,

00:28:36,018 --> 00:28:37,920
not killing them
and torturing them.

00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:41,057
Which is the only way
that you can feel any connection

00:28:41,057 --> 00:28:42,792
to another human being.

00:28:48,416 --> 00:28:51,414
Don't you think that was
a little below the belt, Ray?

00:29:01,077 --> 00:29:02,878
Welcome back.

00:29:02,878 --> 00:29:05,414
The doctors
patched you up.

00:29:05,414 --> 00:29:07,950
You're going to be okay.

00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:09,885
But Kip didn't make it.

00:29:09,885 --> 00:29:12,355
(sighs)

00:29:12,355 --> 00:29:13,823
Did we get 'em?

00:29:13,823 --> 00:29:16,025
We will.

00:29:16,025 --> 00:29:18,027
Thanks...

00:29:18,027 --> 00:29:20,029
for being here.

00:29:20,029 --> 00:29:22,331
Where else would I be?

00:29:24,033 --> 00:29:25,935
You get some rest.

00:29:25,935 --> 00:29:27,803
I'll be back.

00:29:27,803 --> 00:29:29,005
Okay.

00:29:35,811 --> 00:29:37,780
How's he doing?

00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:40,850
Good, I think.

00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:42,411
How you doing?

00:29:42,411 --> 00:29:44,416
I'm still in one piece.

00:29:44,416 --> 00:29:47,290
Yeah, you should probably
get checked out anyway.

00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:48,411
That's usually my line.

00:29:50,793 --> 00:29:53,410
(laughs)
Hey, you're always
taking care of me.

00:29:55,331 --> 00:29:58,301
How about
I take care of you for a change?

00:29:58,301 --> 00:30:00,303
Okay.

00:30:03,739 --> 00:30:06,309
Thanks, Nicky.

00:30:09,278 --> 00:30:10,412
Sometime between
being bludgeoned

00:30:10,412 --> 00:30:13,409
and the postmortem
blast injuries,

00:30:13,409 --> 00:30:16,118
Huxbee managed to get
himself shot in the head.

00:30:16,118 --> 00:30:17,787
Single GSW,
execution style.

00:30:17,787 --> 00:30:19,121
Were you able

00:30:19,121 --> 00:30:20,414
to recover the bullet?

00:30:20,414 --> 00:30:21,991
Nine millimeter
hollow-point.

00:30:21,991 --> 00:30:23,326
Ballistics sent
over a report.

00:30:23,326 --> 00:30:24,417
Hmm.

00:30:24,417 --> 00:30:26,417
Gunshot was overkill.

00:30:26,417 --> 00:30:27,730
Blunt force trauma

00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:29,131
was the cause of death.

00:30:29,131 --> 00:30:31,411
IBIS hit.

00:30:31,411 --> 00:30:33,069
The same gun was used

00:30:33,069 --> 00:30:35,004
in a break-in
at a National Guard armory

00:30:35,004 --> 00:30:36,411
in Salt Lake
nine months ago.

00:30:36,411 --> 00:30:37,417
What did they take?

00:30:37,417 --> 00:30:39,942
Couple of M-9s...

00:30:39,942 --> 00:30:42,416
Wow. 20 pounds of C-4.

00:30:42,416 --> 00:30:46,115
You know, the armory is not
our only link to the military.

00:30:46,115 --> 00:30:49,118
I ran the serial number on
the camera from the warehouse.

00:30:49,118 --> 00:30:50,414
It was purchased

00:30:50,414 --> 00:30:53,222
two years ago at an Army PX

00:30:53,222 --> 00:30:54,724
in Black Rock Arsenal, Virginia.

00:30:54,724 --> 00:30:56,125
The buyer paid cash.

00:30:56,125 --> 00:30:57,417
Maybe at the PX in Virginia,

00:30:57,417 --> 00:31:00,162
but not at Meyer's Hardware
Store in North Las Vegas.

00:31:00,162 --> 00:31:03,032
I just ran Huxbee's recent
credit card purchases.

00:31:03,032 --> 00:31:05,415
Guess who swiped
his plastic.

00:31:07,203 --> 00:31:09,416
SANDERS: That's definitely
Jason McCann on the left.

00:31:09,416 --> 00:31:12,409
Using Huxbee's card, or a
card he took out in his name.

00:31:12,409 --> 00:31:15,111
SANDERS: To buy
bomb-making materials.

00:31:15,111 --> 00:31:17,409
Okay, so, Mr. Non-Violence
loses his temper,

00:31:17,409 --> 00:31:19,248
gives Jason the
back of his hand.

00:31:19,248 --> 00:31:20,916
Explains Jason's bruise in P.D.

00:31:20,916 --> 00:31:22,416
Then Huxbee springs him,

00:31:22,416 --> 00:31:25,411
tells Jason that he's a
threat to their movement.

00:31:25,411 --> 00:31:26,756
It's got to stop.

00:31:26,756 --> 00:31:28,415
So Jason decides
Huxbee'sgot to stop.

00:31:28,415 --> 00:31:29,925
Breathing, that is.

00:31:29,925 --> 00:31:32,261
We know that he didn't
make the bomb alone.

00:31:32,261 --> 00:31:34,416
Let's push in
on this guy.

00:31:34,416 --> 00:31:38,415
SANDERS:
Army field jacket.

00:31:38,415 --> 00:31:39,769
Think the guy's dumb enough

00:31:39,769 --> 00:31:41,103
to wear a jacket
with his name on it?

00:31:41,103 --> 00:31:42,415
Let's check him
against all personnel

00:31:42,415 --> 00:31:45,207
at Black Rock Arsenal
for the last two years.

00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:50,279
JUDGE:
Madame Foreperson,

00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:52,415
have you reached a verdict?

00:31:52,415 --> 00:31:54,250
We have, Your Honor.

00:32:10,199 --> 00:32:12,412
In the case
of Nathaniel Haskell,

00:32:12,412 --> 00:32:16,138
Case Number 20433,
Clark County Criminal Court.

00:32:16,138 --> 00:32:17,973
As to the count of
attempted murder,

00:32:17,973 --> 00:32:19,341
the jury finds

00:32:19,341 --> 00:32:21,944
the defendant guilty.

00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:30,052
It's an injustice.

00:32:30,052 --> 00:32:31,253
The whole world

00:32:31,253 --> 00:32:32,721
is watching.

00:32:32,721 --> 00:32:35,324
JUDGE: Sentencing will be
on February 28.

00:32:35,324 --> 00:32:37,259
This court

00:32:37,259 --> 00:32:38,928
is now adjourned.

00:32:45,413 --> 00:32:47,102
Well done.

00:32:47,102 --> 00:32:48,971
Thanks to you.

00:33:02,818 --> 00:33:05,087
SIDLE:
<i>So, Greg was able</i>

00:33:05,087 --> 00:33:09,024
to I.D. the guy in
the hardware store
with Jason McCann.

00:33:09,024 --> 00:33:12,761
His name is
Timothy Johnson.

00:33:12,761 --> 00:33:15,764
STOKES:
Specialty 89 Delta?

00:33:15,764 --> 00:33:18,067
That's explosive
ordinance disposal.
Yeah.

00:33:18,067 --> 00:33:20,269
And a less-than-honorable
discharge two years ago.

00:33:20,269 --> 00:33:22,238
According to
Nevada DMV,

00:33:22,238 --> 00:33:24,006
he owns a maroon Chevy van.

00:33:24,006 --> 00:33:25,875
Jason's been playing me
this whole time.

00:33:25,875 --> 00:33:28,143
Calling me, acting like
he's trying to save my life

00:33:28,143 --> 00:33:30,179
was just bait to get me,
Catherine and Vartann

00:33:30,179 --> 00:33:31,780
in that building
at the same time,

00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:33,415
so he could blow us
all to smithereens.

00:33:33,415 --> 00:33:35,409
And Kip's the one
who paid for it.

00:33:35,409 --> 00:33:37,415
You know, it was all three
who took his brother down.

00:33:37,415 --> 00:33:39,415
Damn! How could I
not see that, Sara?

00:33:39,415 --> 00:33:41,410
Now, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:42,825
You saw the tripwire.

00:33:42,825 --> 00:33:44,326
That's the
important thing.

00:33:44,326 --> 00:33:46,161
You know what I want to know?

00:33:46,161 --> 00:33:47,730
Is Jason pulling the strings,

00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:49,732
or is someone else
pulling<i>hisstrings?</i>

00:33:49,732 --> 00:33:51,066
Well, we thought it was Huxbee.

00:33:51,066 --> 00:33:52,417
It's got to be
this dude, Johnson.

00:33:52,417 --> 00:33:54,417
Well, we got to find them;
they still have a lot of C-4.

00:33:54,417 --> 00:33:56,872
(sighs) Okay, what
about that DMV address?

00:33:56,872 --> 00:33:58,307
It's no good.
Greg ran it.

00:33:58,307 --> 00:34:00,413
The guy used an abandoned house;
it's the end of the line.

00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:02,211
Maybe not.

00:34:02,211 --> 00:34:04,246
Kids and their phones.

00:34:04,246 --> 00:34:05,414
That dumb-ass called me.

00:34:05,414 --> 00:34:07,850
I think he deserves
a call back, don't you?

00:34:13,722 --> 00:34:15,124
Hello?

00:34:15,124 --> 00:34:16,258
Hey, Jason.

00:34:16,258 --> 00:34:17,860
It's Nick Stokes.
How's it going?

00:34:18,417 --> 00:34:20,412
Bet you weren't expecting

00:34:20,412 --> 00:34:22,298
to hear from me, were you?

00:34:22,298 --> 00:34:23,966
No, actually, I wasn't.

00:34:23,966 --> 00:34:25,334
Maybe we should
just continue

00:34:25,334 --> 00:34:27,236
our conversation right now,
what do you think?

00:34:27,236 --> 00:34:28,417
I mean, we were interrupted.

00:34:28,417 --> 00:34:30,416
I think we have a lot
to talk about, don't you?

00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:35,210
Jason.

00:34:39,114 --> 00:34:41,717
Come on, talk to me,
you little punk.

00:34:41,717 --> 00:34:42,410
(beep)

00:34:44,353 --> 00:34:45,854
I don't think he
likes you anymore.

00:34:45,854 --> 00:34:48,123
Oh, he's gonna like me
a lot less, believe me.

00:34:48,123 --> 00:34:49,124
I got the cell tower.

00:34:49,124 --> 00:34:52,227
CT-16, south receiver,

00:34:52,227 --> 00:34:53,896
22 miles west of Searchlight.

00:34:53,896 --> 00:34:55,418
Not too many people out there.

00:34:55,418 --> 00:34:59,034
Probably not a lot
of maroon vans, either.

00:35:08,177 --> 00:35:09,409
(sirens wailing)

00:35:09,409 --> 00:35:10,416
<i>Captain Brass,</i>

00:35:10,416 --> 00:35:11,416
Air One here.

00:35:11,416 --> 00:35:12,416
Got a visual?

00:35:12,416 --> 00:35:13,416
Affirmative.

00:35:13,416 --> 00:35:16,285
<i>Maroon van, two WMA's</i>

00:35:16,285 --> 00:35:17,417
<i>matching suspect's description.</i>

00:35:17,417 --> 00:35:19,188
BRASS:
<i>Hang back. Maintain visual.</i>

00:35:19,188 --> 00:35:20,416
This is Charlie-O-five.

00:35:20,416 --> 00:35:21,991
What's their position, Air One?

00:35:21,991 --> 00:35:24,960
Just turning west
onto State Route 164.

00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,796
Hey, they're headed
for California, Jim.

00:35:27,796 --> 00:35:30,410
We take 95 south,
we can cut 'em off.

00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:32,413
Just try to keep up.

00:35:37,306 --> 00:35:39,108
The last cage
on the left.

00:35:39,108 --> 00:35:40,943
Thank you.

00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:49,351
Hi, Ray.

00:35:49,351 --> 00:35:50,416
You...

00:35:50,416 --> 00:35:53,155
were magnificent on
the witness stand.

00:35:53,155 --> 00:35:56,225
That MAO-A revelation
of yours...

00:35:56,225 --> 00:35:58,827
Delightfully unexpected.
You know,
a good lawyer

00:35:58,827 --> 00:36:01,764
never asks a question that
he doesn't have the answer to.

00:36:01,764 --> 00:36:03,732
Beware the sin
of pride, Ray.

00:36:03,732 --> 00:36:06,869
But I feel it was
a positive experience,

00:36:06,869 --> 00:36:09,138
because now I feel
even closer to you.

00:36:09,138 --> 00:36:12,207
Discovering we share more
than just your kidney.

00:36:12,207 --> 00:36:13,742
Do you have chills, Ray?

00:36:13,742 --> 00:36:15,416
No. Steady.

00:36:15,416 --> 00:36:18,113
Calm.

00:36:18,113 --> 00:36:19,915
Question, though.

00:36:19,915 --> 00:36:24,920
How long have you known that
you were an MAO-A gene carrier?

00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,414
You heard Dr. Corey,
Ray-- months, maybe...

00:36:27,414 --> 00:36:28,924
maybe longer.
No, you must

00:36:28,924 --> 00:36:30,416
have known
before your first kill.

00:36:30,416 --> 00:36:33,415
My first<i>humankill.</i>

00:36:33,415 --> 00:36:36,932
You talk about a good excuse
to start having some fun, huh?

00:36:36,932 --> 00:36:39,301
Oh,<i>Ray...</i>

00:36:39,301 --> 00:36:41,370
it's like a mirror with you.
(chuckles)

00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:43,413
It's like playing
with myself, only...

00:36:43,413 --> 00:36:45,374
better.

00:36:45,374 --> 00:36:47,209
So, how long have you known?
Ray,

00:36:47,209 --> 00:36:50,411
you know my job history
and that I never, ever
had one in my life.

00:36:50,411 --> 00:36:52,047
So I had to
have income.

00:36:52,047 --> 00:36:54,750
Blood donations,
sperm bank,

00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:57,920
the odd psychological
research study-- those
cute grad students,

00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,987
they pay
good money.

00:36:58,987 --> 00:37:00,756
The first studies
on the MAO-A gene

00:37:00,756 --> 00:37:02,124
didn't happen until the 1970s.

00:37:02,124 --> 00:37:03,358
How did you know, Nate?

00:37:03,358 --> 00:37:05,961
I wanted to be the
first kid on my block

00:37:05,961 --> 00:37:07,262
to have one, Ray,

00:37:07,262 --> 00:37:09,364
so I could blame everything
on my father.

00:37:09,364 --> 00:37:11,033
I just prayed to God

00:37:11,033 --> 00:37:13,202
to bring me one
of those genes, Ray.

00:37:13,202 --> 00:37:14,410
You can't alter your DNA.

00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:16,417
You either have the gene
or you don't.

00:37:19,074 --> 00:37:20,411
Trust me, Ray...

00:37:20,411 --> 00:37:22,411
if you want
something
bad enough,

00:37:22,411 --> 00:37:23,418
you can will it to happen.

00:37:23,418 --> 00:37:25,412
Look at those women;
they fight over me, Ray.

00:37:25,412 --> 00:37:26,416
It's 'cause I will it.

00:37:26,416 --> 00:37:27,415
You're really giving yourself

00:37:27,415 --> 00:37:29,284
a little bit too much credit.
No,

00:37:29,284 --> 00:37:31,413
I'm a chick magnet, Ray,

00:37:31,413 --> 00:37:33,956
and you know that.
You're a magnet
for the walking wounded.

00:37:33,956 --> 00:37:35,290
Look at you
in this cage.

00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:36,892
You're pathetic.

00:37:38,861 --> 00:37:40,329
Whatever.

00:37:40,329 --> 00:37:42,197
You know what

00:37:42,197 --> 00:37:44,366
I dream of more
than sex, Ray?

00:37:44,366 --> 00:37:46,411
What?

00:37:47,412 --> 00:37:49,416
Freedom.

00:37:49,416 --> 00:37:51,416
I bet you do.

00:37:53,041 --> 00:37:55,244
You've killed 14 people.

00:37:55,244 --> 00:37:56,812
There's no gene

00:37:56,812 --> 00:37:59,418
that's gonna magically
make you free, not for that.

00:37:59,418 --> 00:38:03,416
Power of positive thinking, Ray.

00:38:03,416 --> 00:38:07,412
And I'm very positive.

00:38:19,418 --> 00:38:21,413
I thought you were smarter
than your brother, huh?

00:38:21,413 --> 00:38:23,038
But you had to
make it personal.

00:38:23,038 --> 00:38:24,239
It's always been personal.

00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:26,208
They killed my brother;
now they're gonna pay.

00:38:26,208 --> 00:38:28,417
Well, you think you're the
only guy who lost someone?

00:38:28,417 --> 00:38:30,212
I've had more friends
bleed out in my arms

00:38:30,212 --> 00:38:32,147
in the middle of a damn
sandbox than I can count,

00:38:32,147 --> 00:38:33,715
but at least I know
what I'm fighting for--

00:38:33,715 --> 00:38:37,152
real freedom.
Stop talking to me
like I am some kid.

00:38:37,152 --> 00:38:38,414
I brought you in!

00:38:38,414 --> 00:38:40,856
I taught you
everything,
you little punk!

00:38:40,856 --> 00:38:43,415
Not just how to make
bombs but how to bring
this freedom fight home,

00:38:43,415 --> 00:38:44,417
stay alive,

00:38:44,417 --> 00:38:45,828
live to fight another day

00:38:45,828 --> 00:38:47,095
and not go
strength against strength

00:38:47,095 --> 00:38:48,414
and take on the whole damn LVPD.

00:38:48,414 --> 00:38:50,065
You're just gonna
get us killed, kid.

00:38:50,065 --> 00:38:51,733
I'm not afraid.

00:38:54,102 --> 00:38:57,039
AIR OFFICER (over P.A.):
Stop the car. Stop the car!

00:39:04,411 --> 00:39:06,248
What are you doing?
Run it!

00:39:06,248 --> 00:39:07,115
Shut the hell up.

00:39:07,115 --> 00:39:08,750
(sirens wail, then stop)

00:39:10,285 --> 00:39:13,055
BRASS:
Johnson! McCann!
Get out of the car!

00:39:18,409 --> 00:39:19,962
I'm not dying today.

00:39:19,962 --> 00:39:22,097
Don't quit on me.

00:39:22,097 --> 00:39:23,411
BRASS:
Throw your weapons

00:39:23,411 --> 00:39:27,269
out the window,
and step out of the car now.

00:39:27,269 --> 00:39:28,971
Got no choice.
Look at all those guns.

00:39:28,971 --> 00:39:30,339
Shut up!
BRASS:
You're surrounded!

00:39:30,339 --> 00:39:31,773
Get out of the car!

00:39:31,773 --> 00:39:34,109
I'll give up,
but only to Stokes.

00:39:34,109 --> 00:39:36,409
SANDERS:
Don't even think about it.

00:39:36,409 --> 00:39:38,780
Yeah, I'm right here.

00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:41,216
So give up.
I want to talk to you.

00:39:41,216 --> 00:39:42,918
We'll talk.
Get out of there!

00:39:42,918 --> 00:39:44,720
JOHNSON:
Jase, look at me.

00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,410
Live to fight another day,
remember?

00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:47,055
(cocking)

00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:49,324
Get out.

00:39:49,324 --> 00:39:51,226
I'm coming out!

00:39:57,416 --> 00:39:59,134
Get your hands on your head,
turn around

00:39:59,134 --> 00:40:01,236
and get down
on your knees!

00:40:01,236 --> 00:40:02,905
Get down on
your knees!

00:40:06,409 --> 00:40:07,776
McCann, get out of the car!

00:40:07,776 --> 00:40:10,045
Throw the
weapon out!

00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:19,416
Hands on your head!

00:40:19,416 --> 00:40:20,822
Get down on
your knees!

00:40:20,822 --> 00:40:22,157
He's wired!
He's got a bomb!

00:40:22,157 --> 00:40:24,126
He's lying! There's no bomb!
Look! Don't shoot!

00:40:24,126 --> 00:40:25,410
JOHNSON:
Don't shoot! No!

00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:26,416
(gunshot)

00:40:26,416 --> 00:40:28,063
(gunfire)

00:40:32,301 --> 00:40:33,735
Hold your fire.

00:40:56,925 --> 00:40:59,410
(car alarm chirps)

00:41:24,416 --> 00:41:26,411
I need to see Nate Haskell.

00:41:26,411 --> 00:41:28,418
I need to see him right away.
Okay.

00:41:29,725 --> 00:41:31,026
Hey, Haskell?

00:41:31,026 --> 00:41:33,410
Your buddy's...

00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:34,796
What the...?

00:41:34,796 --> 00:41:35,998
Hey, inmate, get up.

00:41:35,998 --> 00:41:39,234
Show us your
wrist band.

00:41:39,234 --> 00:41:41,036
He switched them.

00:41:41,036 --> 00:41:42,415
So where is he?

00:41:42,415 --> 00:41:44,409
A minimum-security van

00:41:44,409 --> 00:41:47,376
<i>just left</i>
<i>about ten minutes ago.</i>

00:41:50,145 --> 00:41:52,412
(tires screech)

00:41:56,409 --> 00:42:00,418
(distorted gunshots, yelling)

00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:20,410
Nate! Now we
can finally...

00:42:24,746 --> 00:42:27,182
Let's take my car.

00:42:28,216 --> 00:42:30,218
Oh, your hands
are so cold.

00:42:30,218 --> 00:42:31,415
Oh, we'll fix that.

00:42:31,415 --> 00:42:33,418
INMATE: Let's get out
of here! Come on!

00:42:39,728 --> 00:42:41,096
Come on.
