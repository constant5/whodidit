to the guy that got capped

00:09:34,229 --> 00:09:35,564

00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:36,598

something stuck
to your shoe.

00:09:42,704 --> 00:09:44,239
Oh, no,
it's just Sanders.

00:09:46,241 --> 00:09:47,342
Hey, I went
through his pockets.

00:09:48,443 --> 00:09:49,845

tripped over

00:13:52,854 --> 00:13:54,456
These kids thought

00:13:54,523 --> 00:13:56,158
they'd found a
real space alien.

00:13:56,224 --> 00:13:58,293
Yeah, we were the second call
they made.

00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,394

was to Dan Rather...

00:14:01,329 --> 00:14:02,597

He put it on the "Watch

It's been a freaking

SIDLE:
Area 51.

TRAVIS:
It's the most secretive piece
of real estate in the world.

00:14:21,283 --> 00:14:22,417
This is about as close
to the base

00:14:22,484 --> 00:14:23,852
as we can get and still be

00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:25,587

00:14:25,654 --> 00:14:26,588
I guess the killer

00:14:26,655 --> 00:14:27,856
should've dug a deeper hole.

Something for Hodges.

One thing's for sure:
it's going to take

00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:48,610
a lot longer getting him out
than it did getting him in.

00:14:48,677 --> 00:14:50,712
Can't you guys
just beam him back
to the morgue?

00:20:24,643 --> 00:20:26,811
On behalf
of the Golden Nugget,

00:20:26,878 --> 00:20:28,346
let me congratulate you.

00:20:28,413 --> 00:20:29,547
You know how long

00:20:29,614 --> 00:20:31,416
I've played here
and I've never gotten laid?

00:20:31,483 --> 00:20:32,851
Hey, Warrick, how you doing?

00:20:32,918 --> 00:20:34,553
Good.
Listen, we've got

00:20:34,619 --> 00:20:36,087
your favorite 21 table
ready for you over there, okay?

00:20:36,154 --> 00:20:37,689
Tricks are for kids, man.

00:20:37,756 --> 00:20:39,250
I don't play games anymore.

00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,185
Then what are you doing here?
I'm working on a case.

00:20:41,252 --> 00:20:43,954
Did anyone hit a big
jackpot here yesterday?

00:20:44,021 --> 00:20:46,424
Yeah, guy won 50 G on that
big machine over there.

00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:47,458
50 G?
Uh-huh.

00:20:47,525 --> 00:20:49,393
Did he look like this?

00:20:51,429 --> 00:20:52,930
Yep, that's him.
Do you remember

00:20:52,997 --> 00:20:54,332
about what time that was?

00:20:54,398 --> 00:20:55,333
Midnight.

00:20:55,399 --> 00:20:56,667
That was the end of my shift.

00:20:56,734 --> 00:20:58,002
Looks like he needed it, too.

00:20:58,069 --> 00:20:58,936
Really?

00:20:59,003 --> 00:20:59,970
Yeah, dirty clothes,

00:21:00,037 --> 00:21:00,871
serious B.O.

00:21:00,938 --> 00:21:02,440
Funkier than
James Brown, huh?

00:21:02,506 --> 00:21:04,342
Big time.
Don't be a stranger.

00:21:04,408 --> 00:21:06,010
Good to see you, man.

00:21:07,211 --> 00:21:10,081
Blood standard, unknown urine,
tell me it's the same guy.

00:21:10,147 --> 00:21:12,149
Now, Greg mentioned
to you that my stuff

00:21:12,216 --> 00:21:13,351
gets done first, right?

00:21:13,417 --> 00:21:15,619
Yeah, well, in my lab,
I decide what gets run and when.

00:21:15,686 --> 00:21:18,155
Unless Mr. Grissom
tells me otherwise.

00:21:18,222 --> 00:21:19,890
It's uh, quiet in here.

00:21:19,957 --> 00:21:21,292
Greg played music.

00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:23,427
Well, I find it
distracting.

00:21:25,363 --> 00:21:27,064
Hit on your fingerprint
from the Palermo.

00:21:27,131 --> 00:21:28,065
Carl Johnson?

00:21:28,132 --> 00:21:29,867
Nope, George Craven.

00:21:29,934 --> 00:21:31,535
Ex-con.

00:21:31,602 --> 00:21:33,337
Record for
domestic violence.

00:21:33,404 --> 00:21:37,608
Runs security
at the Embassy Strip Club.

00:21:45,449 --> 00:21:47,618
Mr. Willard, Las Vegas, Police.

00:21:47,685 --> 00:21:49,020
We have a warrant.

00:21:50,788 --> 00:21:52,757
Go around the back, Bobby.

00:21:56,761 --> 00:21:58,362
You get this address
off a pill bottle?

00:21:58,429 --> 00:22:00,564
Herpes.

00:22:00,631 --> 00:22:03,734
There was a prescription
for Valacyclovin.

00:22:03,801 --> 00:22:06,570
I cross-referenced
the pharmacy logo.

00:22:06,637 --> 00:22:08,873
( <i>clattering</i> )

00:22:09,907 --> 00:22:10,941
Sorry.

00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:13,978
I'm late.

00:22:25,122 --> 00:22:27,224
BRASS:
Polaroid doesn't do him justice.

00:22:38,369 --> 00:22:41,072
Same kind of wire I found
in the first victim's car.

00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:46,777
Ken Willard.

00:22:46,844 --> 00:22:48,946
Yeah, I recognize that
guy in the picture.

00:22:49,013 --> 00:22:50,114
From Blitzkrieg?

00:22:50,181 --> 00:22:52,283
Manny, the club owner.

00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:54,418
So our first victim

00:22:54,485 --> 00:22:56,587
( <i>man choking</i> )
<i>strangled this guy with wire,</i>

00:22:56,654 --> 00:23:00,791
<i>photographs it...</i>
<i>takes it to the club,</i>

00:23:00,858 --> 00:23:03,794
<i>burns it for some reason,</i>

00:23:03,861 --> 00:23:05,629
<i>and then takes one</i>
<i>between the eyes himself?</i>

00:23:05,696 --> 00:23:06,330
( <i>gunshot</i> )

00:23:06,397 --> 00:23:07,765
Bring me the head

00:23:07,832 --> 00:23:09,500
of John the Baptist.

00:23:09,567 --> 00:23:11,469
Salome--

00:23:11,535 --> 00:23:13,304
wanted proof
that he was dead.

00:23:13,371 --> 00:23:15,473
They didn't have
Polaroids back then.

00:23:15,539 --> 00:23:18,075
So you're saying our first
victim was a hired killer.

00:23:18,142 --> 00:23:19,310
Hired by whom?

00:23:19,377 --> 00:23:20,878
Whoever shot him?

00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:29,719
( <i>lisping</i> ):
<i>And like a blinding supernova,</i>

00:23:29,785 --> 00:23:32,788
your love is blasting
throughout the universe.

00:23:32,855 --> 00:23:35,658
Two spirits have become one.

00:23:35,725 --> 00:23:36,859
Earthling to earthling.

00:23:36,926 --> 00:23:37,960
So...

00:23:38,027 --> 00:23:41,230
by the power of the sun
and the moon

00:23:41,297 --> 00:23:44,033
and all the planets
in the universe,

00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,135
and the great state of Nevada,

00:23:46,202 --> 00:23:49,905
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

00:23:49,972 --> 00:23:52,308
You may kiss that bride.

00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:53,509
( <i>applause</i> )

00:23:53,576 --> 00:23:57,346
Don't get all misty
on me, now.

00:23:57,413 --> 00:24:00,182
So the deceased's costume
was similar to mine, you say?

00:24:00,249 --> 00:24:02,051
Yeah, identical.

00:24:02,118 --> 00:24:04,153
Manufactured by
Big City Costumes.

00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,489
Specifically designed
for this chapel.

00:24:06,555 --> 00:24:07,790
Yeah, that's who makes them.

00:24:07,857 --> 00:24:09,425
I guess I shouldn't
be so surprised--

00:24:09,492 --> 00:24:11,260
things get stolen
from here all the time.

00:24:11,327 --> 00:24:12,928
Them sci-fi nuts,

00:24:12,995 --> 00:24:14,864
you know,
they're big collectors.

00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:18,267
Do the initials E.T.
mean anything to you?

00:24:18,334 --> 00:24:20,436
No, just the...
Honey, we have a 3:00.

00:24:20,503 --> 00:24:22,538
Oh, yeah.

00:24:22,605 --> 00:24:24,573
So business is good?

00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,675
Oh, yes, never better.

00:24:25,741 --> 00:24:27,576
You know, I mean, people,
they come to Vegas

00:24:27,643 --> 00:24:28,944
to get rich or to get hitched.

00:24:29,011 --> 00:24:31,047
I mean, you know, that's
not why we do it, though.

00:24:31,113 --> 00:24:32,782
Is it, honey?

00:24:32,848 --> 00:24:35,284
We believe in love,

00:24:35,351 --> 00:24:37,053
you know, in just
whatever form it might take.

00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:39,355
Are you two married?

00:24:39,422 --> 00:24:40,489
No.

00:24:40,556 --> 00:24:42,892
No? All right, well,
we're open 24 hours.

00:24:42,958 --> 00:24:46,462
There's a toll-free number right
there on the back, all right?

00:24:46,529 --> 00:24:48,431
Don't let
this moment
pass you by.

00:24:48,497 --> 00:24:50,032
She's gonna getcha.

00:24:50,099 --> 00:24:52,334
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:24:56,005 --> 00:24:57,139
Hey!

00:24:57,206 --> 00:24:58,374
You kids don't want
to get married

00:24:58,441 --> 00:25:00,276
by Spock or whatever
his name is in there.

00:25:00,343 --> 00:25:02,211
What would your mother say?
Here.

00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,881
ELVIS IMPERSONATOR:
Come on, all you hound dogs,

00:25:05,948 --> 00:25:07,049
get married by the king

00:25:07,116 --> 00:25:08,951
at the Burnin' Love
Wedding Chapel.

00:25:09,018 --> 00:25:10,920
Viva Las Vegas, man.

00:25:10,986 --> 00:25:12,955
How do you explain

00:25:13,022 --> 00:25:14,590
your fingerprint
on the murder weapon?

00:25:14,657 --> 00:25:16,425
I don't need
to explain anything.

00:25:16,492 --> 00:25:18,594
I didn't kill her.

00:25:20,162 --> 00:25:22,431
Thumbprint on the towel bar?

00:25:22,498 --> 00:25:24,600
In the bathroom at the Palermo?

00:25:24,667 --> 00:25:25,935
Yeah.
Yeah, I was in there.

00:25:26,001 --> 00:25:28,270
I took a leak.

00:25:28,337 --> 00:25:30,339
Come on, Raven's my girl,
all right?

00:25:30,406 --> 00:25:32,108
She always had me
check out her money.

00:25:32,174 --> 00:25:34,844
You let your girlfriend
turn tricks?

00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:37,113
Two grand to do
some Midwestern chump?

00:25:37,179 --> 00:25:39,782
She wouldn't turn it down,
and I wasn't gonna stop her.

00:25:39,849 --> 00:25:42,451
<i>Dude stumbled in</i>
<i>from the Acid Drop</i>

00:25:42,518 --> 00:25:44,920
<i>ready to go.</i>

00:25:49,091 --> 00:25:51,293
<i>He seemed harmless.</i>

00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,962
<i>I used the facility</i>
<i>before I left.</i>

00:25:55,831 --> 00:25:58,100
Then I bounced.

00:25:58,167 --> 00:26:00,503
I was cool with

00:26:00,569 --> 00:26:01,771
her way of life.

00:26:01,837 --> 00:26:04,273
But I didn't want
to stay and watch.

00:26:06,442 --> 00:26:07,476
Fresh wounds.

00:26:07,543 --> 00:26:08,611
You get those

00:26:08,678 --> 00:26:11,013
kicking guys out of
The Embassy, or...

00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,748
kicking your girlfriend's ass?

00:26:13,849 --> 00:26:15,151
I don't think that
you were cool

00:26:15,217 --> 00:26:16,352
with her ways.

00:26:16,419 --> 00:26:18,854
A big, strong guy like you,

00:26:18,921 --> 00:26:20,389
you're not gonna
share her.

00:26:20,456 --> 00:26:22,725
She didn't tell you
where she was going.

00:26:22,792 --> 00:26:25,761
You followed her,
and you killed her.

00:26:26,896 --> 00:26:28,798
You damn tramp whore!

00:26:28,864 --> 00:26:29,899
No!

00:26:29,965 --> 00:26:34,236
( <i>yelling and gasping</i> )

00:26:38,374 --> 00:26:40,209
I need a lawyer.

00:26:40,276 --> 00:26:42,478
I need your clothes.

00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:49,418
So, you like her?

00:26:49,485 --> 00:26:52,254
I like not being her anymore.

00:26:52,321 --> 00:26:56,025
The sticky substance
in the slide of your gun
is tape adhesive.

00:26:56,092 --> 00:26:57,827
What about
the blue coloring?

00:26:59,762 --> 00:27:01,597
Chloromide M.E.A.,

00:27:01,664 --> 00:27:04,600
sodium lauryl
sulfate, pine oil.

00:27:04,667 --> 00:27:07,002
Components of your basic
bathroom disinfectant.

00:27:07,069 --> 00:27:10,139
So, Greg, how do you
explain adhesive

00:27:10,206 --> 00:27:12,675
and toilet bowl
cleanser on the gun?

00:27:12,742 --> 00:27:14,643
I don't know.

00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:18,114
I can tell you the toilets
in the club had blue water.

00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:21,851
You inspected the toilet
bowls for evidence?

00:27:22,918 --> 00:27:25,354
Well, when you got to go,
you got to go.

00:27:25,421 --> 00:27:26,422
Whew.

00:27:26,489 --> 00:27:28,090
GRISSOM:
At a crime
scene, Greg?

00:27:28,157 --> 00:27:29,425
Everybody knows you hold it.

00:27:29,492 --> 00:27:31,160
You go across the street
or next-door,

00:27:31,227 --> 00:27:32,595
somewhere other
than the scene,

00:27:32,661 --> 00:27:34,163
until you've
cleared the restroom.

00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,631
Did you clear the restroom?

00:27:35,698 --> 00:27:37,633
No.

00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:40,336
Well, you could've
flushed away evidence,

00:27:40,403 --> 00:27:42,938
wiped away fingerprints
from the handle.

00:27:43,005 --> 00:27:44,974
Make sure you
include this

00:27:45,041 --> 00:27:47,209
in your field notes.

00:27:52,214 --> 00:27:53,916
I like Chandra.

00:27:53,983 --> 00:27:55,651
She's cute.

00:27:57,319 --> 00:28:00,289
The .32 automatic
we found at your club,
the serial numbers

00:28:00,356 --> 00:28:01,524
were filed off.

00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:03,959
I mean, you know better
than anyone, that's a felony.

00:28:04,026 --> 00:28:05,928
Lucky for us,
the Crime Lab

00:28:05,995 --> 00:28:07,496
recovered the numbers.

00:28:07,563 --> 00:28:09,598
Hey, look, that gun was stolen

00:28:09,665 --> 00:28:11,901
out of my desk last week.

00:28:11,967 --> 00:28:13,669
So what's this,
"The dog ate my homework"?

00:28:13,736 --> 00:28:15,237
Come on, man, think about it.

00:28:15,304 --> 00:28:16,405
<i>Why would I kill somebody</i>

00:28:16,472 --> 00:28:17,807
in my own club?

00:28:17,873 --> 00:28:19,342
I still got yellow tape

00:28:19,408 --> 00:28:21,177
across the front door.
What do you care?

00:28:21,243 --> 00:28:23,145
You only own ten percent
of the club.

00:28:23,212 --> 00:28:24,747
Ken Willard owns the rest.

00:28:24,814 --> 00:28:26,782
Yeah, but the guy's not around.

00:28:26,849 --> 00:28:30,319
Besides... things change.

00:28:30,386 --> 00:28:32,355
You're damn right they do.

00:28:32,421 --> 00:28:33,856
He's dead.

00:28:35,558 --> 00:28:36,559
What?

00:28:38,094 --> 00:28:40,029
Wait-wait-wait, you don't think
that I had any...

00:28:41,163 --> 00:28:43,065
No.

00:28:52,441 --> 00:28:54,377
Hi. Chris here?

00:28:54,443 --> 00:28:55,945
You are...?

00:28:56,012 --> 00:28:56,946
I'm Catherine.

00:28:57,013 --> 00:28:59,148
Oh, right, you must
be his cop friend.

00:29:00,282 --> 00:29:01,784
Hey.

00:29:01,851 --> 00:29:03,619
Hi.
You should've
told me

00:29:03,686 --> 00:29:05,221
you were coming down.

00:29:06,222 --> 00:29:07,723
What's going on?

00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:09,692
I'm checking out an alibi.

00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:11,027
Was this guy in here
last night?

00:29:11,093 --> 00:29:13,162
Yeah, he was, uh,

00:29:13,229 --> 00:29:14,663
belligerent, drunk--
he was groping

00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:15,965
every waitress
in the place.

00:29:16,032 --> 00:29:18,234
We sent him over to the
strip joint next-door.

00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,635
It was more his speed.

00:29:19,702 --> 00:29:22,071
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

00:29:22,138 --> 00:29:23,406
You're busy.

00:29:24,707 --> 00:29:26,475
Am I gonna see
you tonight?

00:29:26,542 --> 00:29:28,711
I'm working late.

00:29:28,778 --> 00:29:30,479
Me, too.

00:29:48,964 --> 00:29:51,367
( <i>computer beeping</i> )

00:30:05,915 --> 00:30:07,550
Duct tape.

00:30:08,484 --> 00:30:10,319
So the shooter stuck the gun

00:30:10,386 --> 00:30:12,021
in the toilet earlier

00:30:12,088 --> 00:30:14,190
to avoid the metal detector.

00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:19,929
Echoes of Michael Corleone.

00:30:19,995 --> 00:30:23,232
So if Manny is the shooter,

00:30:23,299 --> 00:30:25,468
why would he need
to hide his own gun?

00:30:25,534 --> 00:30:27,069
He wouldn't.

00:30:28,838 --> 00:30:30,573
So what are you gonna do now?

00:30:30,639 --> 00:30:32,341
Check for prints.

00:30:36,479 --> 00:30:37,646
Please don't do that.

00:30:37,713 --> 00:30:39,448
Oh, sorry. Uh,
I was just looking

00:30:39,515 --> 00:30:40,950
for our alien
DNA analysis.

00:30:41,017 --> 00:30:42,785
Not yet.

00:30:42,852 --> 00:30:44,887
Come on, where's your
intellectual curiosity?

00:30:45,955 --> 00:30:48,758
I hardly considered it
a priority.

00:30:48,824 --> 00:30:49,892
It's very neat in here.

00:30:49,959 --> 00:30:51,227
You're very neat, Chandra.

00:30:51,293 --> 00:30:53,295
( <i>printer printing</i> )

00:30:53,362 --> 00:30:55,798
Thank you.

00:30:55,865 --> 00:30:57,566
Your shovel from
the desert?

00:31:00,536 --> 00:31:02,004
Dug into the paint history

00:31:02,071 --> 00:31:03,272
of somebody's car.

00:31:05,975 --> 00:31:07,476
Black enamel undercoats,

00:31:07,543 --> 00:31:09,478
General Motors,
'60s vintage.

00:31:09,545 --> 00:31:11,447
Three layers of primer

00:31:11,514 --> 00:31:13,349
plus a acrylic top, pink.

00:31:13,416 --> 00:31:15,217
A pink Cadillac?

00:31:16,886 --> 00:31:19,689
Hey. E.T. phoned home.

00:31:19,755 --> 00:31:21,190
I got an I.D. off
the hearing aid.

00:31:21,257 --> 00:31:22,825
Our alien is

00:31:22,892 --> 00:31:27,630
Reverend Edward Thomas
of 49 Stuart Street.

00:31:27,697 --> 00:31:29,465
Oh, the Chapel
of Intergalactic Love.

00:31:29,532 --> 00:31:30,766
We've already been there.

00:31:30,833 --> 00:31:31,967
Well, if the reverend is dead,

00:31:32,034 --> 00:31:33,035
who's running the place?

00:31:33,102 --> 00:31:34,437
( <i>loud slam</i> )

00:31:34,503 --> 00:31:36,372
Could you please
take this somewhere else?

00:31:36,439 --> 00:31:40,609
We know where there's
a pink Cadillac.

00:31:40,676 --> 00:31:41,844
( <i>like Elvis</i> ):
Thank ya.

00:31:41,911 --> 00:31:43,179
Thank ya very much.

00:31:43,245 --> 00:31:44,947
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:48,784
I got the stripper's
boyfriend on camera.

00:31:48,851 --> 00:31:50,052
If he just killed somebody,

00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:52,221
he's being really cool
about it.

00:31:52,288 --> 00:31:55,558
Yeah, and he didn't change
his clothes from last night.

00:31:55,625 --> 00:31:57,760
I screened them
for blood--

00:31:57,827 --> 00:32:00,496
negative.

00:32:00,563 --> 00:32:03,733
And the tox report
on Mr. Johnson

00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:07,837
confirms traces
of triazelam in
his blood.

00:32:07,904 --> 00:32:11,040
So golf ball salesman
was too doped up to kill her.

00:32:11,107 --> 00:32:13,142
The boyfriend couldn't
have bludgeoned her

00:32:13,209 --> 00:32:15,845
without getting
blood on his clothes.

00:32:15,912 --> 00:32:16,979
No.

00:32:18,147 --> 00:32:19,115
Hey.

00:32:19,181 --> 00:32:22,418
If Lance Frazer won 50 grand,
I can't find it.

00:32:22,485 --> 00:32:25,588
It's not in his room,
no bank account, no car.

00:32:25,655 --> 00:32:26,789
What time did the super say

00:32:26,856 --> 00:32:28,024
the electricity
went out?

00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:29,025
12:30.

00:32:29,091 --> 00:32:30,026
12:30?

00:32:30,092 --> 00:32:32,695
How does a broke-ass guy
like Lance lose 50 grand

00:32:32,762 --> 00:32:33,796
in 30 minutes?

00:32:33,863 --> 00:32:37,333
Had to take him ten minutes
just to walk back home.

00:32:39,702 --> 00:32:42,672
Well, they say gamblers
are creatures of habit.

00:32:42,738 --> 00:32:44,907
I bet you Lance did
the same thing every day.

00:32:44,974 --> 00:32:46,108
Win or lose.

00:32:46,175 --> 00:32:50,012
I'm going to need to take a walk
in this guy's shoes.

00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:06,768
Hey, Captain.
Yo.

00:33:06,835 --> 00:33:08,102
Do you sell
Clark cigarettes?

00:33:08,169 --> 00:33:09,404
Yeah, I do.

00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:11,840
You know, you've got to be
the only other guy in Vegas

00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:13,041
that smokes these sticks?

00:33:13,107 --> 00:33:14,108
Really?

00:33:14,175 --> 00:33:15,109
Yeah.

00:33:15,176 --> 00:33:16,110
Is this the other guy?

00:33:16,177 --> 00:33:17,912
That's him.

00:33:17,979 --> 00:33:19,214
He's here every night.

00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,883
Big spender.
Pays me in quarters.

00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,321
Sara.

00:34:04,325 --> 00:34:06,995
Let's go talk to the king.

00:34:09,164 --> 00:34:10,131
Hey, Pop.

00:34:10,198 --> 00:34:11,833
Like the Buddha
said to the monk,

00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,101
make me one with everything.

00:34:13,168 --> 00:34:15,370
Sure thing, boss.

00:34:15,436 --> 00:34:16,738
Coming right up.

00:34:18,106 --> 00:34:19,240
Were you working last night?

00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,241
Nope.

00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:22,844
I don't usually work this stand.

00:34:22,911 --> 00:34:24,512
Who does?

00:34:24,579 --> 00:34:25,980
Some punk kid.

00:34:26,047 --> 00:34:27,649
Just up and quit last night.

00:34:27,715 --> 00:34:29,217
Left the stand
sitting right here.

00:34:29,284 --> 00:34:30,251
Really?

00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:34,055
Would you happen to know
where this punk kid lives?

00:34:42,463 --> 00:34:44,599
Daniel Halburt!

00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:46,501
We've got a warrant
to search the premises!

00:34:46,568 --> 00:34:49,437
Open up!

00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:50,772
Yeah, what up, man?

00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:52,006
Get out!

00:34:52,073 --> 00:34:53,141
Hey, man!

00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,445
Clear!

00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,280
Clear!

00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:02,116
Whoo!

00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:05,720
Would you look at the size
of this flat screen?

00:35:05,787 --> 00:35:08,857
My lord, that's a whole month
of my pay right there.

00:35:08,923 --> 00:35:10,758
A new PlayStation?

00:35:12,927 --> 00:35:14,429
A brand-new stereo?

00:35:24,105 --> 00:35:26,774
You must have sold a lot
of hot dogs last night, huh?

00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:32,881
Did you get that
from Lance?

00:35:32,947 --> 00:35:34,382
You know, your old friend.

00:35:34,449 --> 00:35:36,551
Did you sell a lot
of hot dogs to him?

00:35:36,618 --> 00:35:38,319
I finally hit.

00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:40,755
50 large, cash.

00:35:40,822 --> 00:35:44,959
Kick back in the tub,
pay off that shifty super,

00:35:45,026 --> 00:35:47,195
and I'm checking
into the Bellagio.

00:35:48,663 --> 00:35:52,367
I gambled every day of my life.

00:35:52,433 --> 00:35:54,802
I never won a damn thing.

00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:10,251
Tell me where the money is.

00:36:13,555 --> 00:36:14,722
( <i>sizzling</i> )

00:36:16,758 --> 00:36:20,662
He should have just showed me
where the money was.

00:36:20,728 --> 00:36:21,830
It was in the Bible.

00:36:22,964 --> 00:36:24,399
Take this guy out of here.

00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:30,705
So as the one
and only king of rock and roll,

00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:32,373
I now pronounce you,
husband and wife.

00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,542
You get over there
and kiss that bride!

00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,478
All right!

00:36:36,544 --> 00:36:37,545
There we go!

00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:40,949
Does Elvis look
familiar to you?

00:36:41,015 --> 00:36:41,950
That's the stuff!

00:36:42,016 --> 00:36:43,451
Do karate if you do, right?

00:36:43,518 --> 00:36:46,788
♪ Viva Las Vegas ♪

00:36:46,855 --> 00:36:48,189
♪ Viva Las Vegas ♪

00:36:51,493 --> 00:36:54,295
That's right, that's right.

00:36:54,362 --> 00:36:57,298
You want to tell us about
the scratch on the Cadillac?

00:36:57,365 --> 00:36:58,566
( <i>lisping</i> ):
I mean, come on.

00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:00,134
That's more
than just a scratch.

00:37:00,201 --> 00:37:03,605
I mean, it's nothing compared
to the vandalism or the stress.

00:37:03,671 --> 00:37:04,906
I mean, come on.

00:37:04,973 --> 00:37:07,408
It's a war out there,
you know?

00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:09,544
Marriage is money
in this town

00:37:09,611 --> 00:37:11,312
and every chapel owner
wants more.

00:37:11,379 --> 00:37:14,382
I mean, last month,
middle of the "I do's,"

00:37:14,449 --> 00:37:18,286
a rock comes flying
through my stained glass.

00:37:18,353 --> 00:37:21,189
Were you in a war
with Ed Thomas?

00:37:21,256 --> 00:37:23,491
We found the shovel
near the body.

00:37:23,558 --> 00:37:27,362
The paint transfer
matches your car.

00:37:28,563 --> 00:37:32,367
Well, I guess Ed was at war
with me.

00:37:34,235 --> 00:37:37,639
( <i>muttering angrily</i> )

00:37:37,705 --> 00:37:42,510
I mean, I was looking
for a truce.

00:37:42,577 --> 00:37:44,979
<i>At first I thought</i>
<i>that he was ignoring me,</i>

00:37:45,046 --> 00:37:46,214
<i>and then I remembered</i>
<i>about his hearing problem.</i>

00:37:46,281 --> 00:37:48,750
Ed, I want
to talk to you.

00:37:48,817 --> 00:37:51,853
Ed, I want to talk to you.

00:37:57,926 --> 00:38:00,829
He was dead when I got there,
I swear it.

00:38:00,895 --> 00:38:03,665
It must have been
a heart attack or something.

00:38:03,731 --> 00:38:07,468
And so I took him out to Area 51
and then I buried him.

00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:09,838
Why would you possibly take him
all the way out there?

00:38:16,611 --> 00:38:19,180
Because it's what
he would have wanted.

00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:23,151
And so then you just

00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:25,086
took over his business?

00:38:25,153 --> 00:38:26,287
Yeah, well, I mean,

00:38:26,354 --> 00:38:28,389
it seemed like a good idea
at the time, you know?

00:38:28,456 --> 00:38:29,824
Keep spreading the love.

00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:31,125
The coroner determined

00:38:31,192 --> 00:38:33,361
that Ed suffered
from Marfan syndrome,

00:38:33,428 --> 00:38:34,762
similar to Abe Lincoln.

00:38:34,829 --> 00:38:36,931
Abnormally long fingers,

00:38:36,998 --> 00:38:39,701
arms, legs, scoliosis.

00:38:39,767 --> 00:38:43,671
So, what does that got
to do with me?

00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:46,708
The syndrome weakened
Ed's abdominal aorta.

00:38:46,774 --> 00:38:48,576
When you found him,
he wasn't dead,

00:38:48,643 --> 00:38:49,811
he was unconscious.

00:38:49,878 --> 00:38:51,546
He was bleeding
internally.

00:38:51,613 --> 00:38:53,414
Yeah, the coroner
found dirt in his stomach

00:38:53,481 --> 00:38:56,017
and his upper airways,

00:38:56,084 --> 00:38:58,720
underneath
his fingernails.

00:39:03,525 --> 00:39:05,393
( <i>screams</i> )

00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:08,730
He died from asphyxia,
all right,

00:39:08,796 --> 00:39:10,165
but it was post-burial.

00:39:16,471 --> 00:39:19,207
( <i>softly</i> ):
I think I'm going to be sick.

00:39:21,476 --> 00:39:22,644
I'm sorry.

00:39:34,489 --> 00:39:36,124
Hit the lights.

00:39:41,729 --> 00:39:45,266
The victim had a swollen ankle.

00:39:45,333 --> 00:39:48,603
What if this bracelet
is an anklet?

00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:54,475
<i>By then Johnson had passed out</i>
<i>from the triazelam.</i>

00:39:56,544 --> 00:39:59,214
The more docile the john,
the easier the job,

00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,883
except when you need him
to save your life.

00:40:03,751 --> 00:40:05,153
Please, wake up, wake up.

00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:15,129
Well, if Johnson was innocent,
why'd he lie to us?

00:40:15,196 --> 00:40:19,634
Try explaining this
to your family back in Ohio.

00:40:19,701 --> 00:40:22,103
GRISSOM:
Are you aware
that your fingerprints

00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,972
are in the federal system?

00:40:24,038 --> 00:40:25,473
You're awaiting trial
on drug trafficking,

00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:26,474
Manny posted your bail.

00:40:26,541 --> 00:40:27,609
I was just
helping her out.

00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:28,977
It wasn't my "E."

00:40:29,043 --> 00:40:30,612
Oh, yeah?
Who's "E" was it?

00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:32,447
Ken Willard
asked me to bring

00:40:32,514 --> 00:40:35,083
a bag back from L.A. for him.

00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:36,184
I didn't know what was in it.

00:40:36,251 --> 00:40:38,119
So you and Ken had
a relationship?

00:40:38,186 --> 00:40:40,155
We dated.

00:40:40,221 --> 00:40:43,057
You both took
Valacyclovin as well.

00:40:43,124 --> 00:40:46,227
We found your prints
on some duct tape

00:40:46,294 --> 00:40:47,695
in the women's restroom.

00:40:47,762 --> 00:40:52,567
<i>The duct tape</i>
<i>was used to hide Manny's gun.</i>

00:40:52,634 --> 00:40:54,736
The gun used
to kill your hit man.

00:40:54,802 --> 00:40:56,738
Hit man?

00:40:56,804 --> 00:40:58,473
What the hell
are you talking about?

00:40:58,540 --> 00:40:59,574
Well, with Ken Willard gone,

00:40:59,641 --> 00:41:00,909
your 10% of the club
becomes 100%.

00:41:00,975 --> 00:41:03,178
I didn't kill him

00:41:03,244 --> 00:41:04,479
and she doesn't deserve
to go to jail.

00:41:04,546 --> 00:41:05,747
Look, the guy was a snake.

00:41:05,814 --> 00:41:08,983
Picking up girls,
using them as mules,
throwing them away.

00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:10,919
So what does a contract killer
cost these days, Manny?

00:41:10,985 --> 00:41:12,821
Manny didn't do anything.

00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:14,289
He's only tried to help me.

00:41:14,355 --> 00:41:16,457
The guy said
he could solve

00:41:16,524 --> 00:41:18,259
my problem for ten grand.

00:41:18,326 --> 00:41:19,694
When the job was done,
he said the price had doubled.

00:41:19,761 --> 00:41:21,429
I couldn't afford that...

00:41:21,496 --> 00:41:22,797
and I didn't want

00:41:22,864 --> 00:41:25,099
to get Manny involved.

00:41:25,166 --> 00:41:27,735
So I stole the gun
from his office.

00:41:27,802 --> 00:41:29,571
<i>I kept it</i>
<i>in the bathroom overnight...</i>

00:41:29,637 --> 00:41:31,940
( <i>hip-hop music blaring</i> )

00:41:32,006 --> 00:41:33,675
<i>waited till</i>
<i>that son of a bitch showed up,</i>

00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:36,110
<i>picked my moment.</i>

00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:42,150
Second I get arrested,
Ken dumps me.

00:41:42,217 --> 00:41:45,220
He says he'll kill me
if I roll over on him.

00:41:45,286 --> 00:41:48,356
The way I saw it,
I had two choices:

00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:50,658
either kill him or go to jail.

00:41:53,228 --> 00:41:55,563
Congratulations. You got both.

00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:04,239
( <i>techno music blaring</i> )

00:42:13,081 --> 00:42:13,848
( <i>laughing</i> )

00:42:24,993 --> 00:42:26,361
What do you expect?

00:42:30,698 --> 00:42:32,200
I run a nightclub.

00:42:39,874 --> 00:42:41,876
Who was that?

00:42:57,292 --> 00:42:59,460
You committed
a fatal error, Greg.

00:42:59,527 --> 00:43:02,197
You compromised evidence
at a crime scene.

00:43:02,263 --> 00:43:05,300
A judgment like that
can cost us a conviction.

00:43:07,268 --> 00:43:09,604
In order to solo in the field,

00:43:09,671 --> 00:43:13,241
you have to successfully
complete three proficiencies.

00:43:17,879 --> 00:43:18,813
I failed this one.

00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,882
Yeah.

00:43:29,224 --> 00:43:30,258
But...

00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,028
since you found
a suitable replacement

00:43:34,095 --> 00:43:36,231
in the lab,

00:43:36,297 --> 00:43:38,666
I'm going to give you
one more chance.

00:43:40,235 --> 00:43:41,569
Thank you.

00:43:43,505 --> 00:43:45,273
Thank you.

00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:55,416
Hey, Chandra,
how was your first day?

00:43:55,483 --> 00:43:56,417
I can't do this.

00:43:56,484 --> 00:43:58,019
It's too much
for one person.

00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:00,355
They all want...

00:44:00,421 --> 00:44:04,159
they all want you,
and I can't be you.

00:44:04,225 --> 00:44:06,333
I'm sorry, Greg,
but I'm going back

00:44:06,333 --> 00:44:07,667
to Connecticut.
