What are you doing?

00:00:20,921 --> 00:00:22,656
GRISSOM:
I'm going insane.

00:00:22,722 --> 00:00:24,724
I don't understand
this diagram.

00:00:26,893 --> 00:00:29,496
You don't need a diagram.

00:00:29,563 --> 00:00:31,598
You need a woman.

00:00:37,904 --> 00:00:41,007
I'm looking forward
to your speech.

00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,978
( <i>applause</i> )

00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:51,618
What A.D. Cavallo

00:00:51,685 --> 00:00:53,019
will enjoy the most

00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:55,622
is no longer having to lie about
how much work he has to do.

00:00:58,191 --> 00:01:00,460
Enjoy your retirement, Bob.

00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,997
But seriously, folks...

00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,199
appointing the new
Assistant Director

00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:08,068
for the Crime Lab is not a task

00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:09,636
I take lightly.
I believe

00:01:09,703 --> 00:01:12,005
in promoting
from within.

00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,673
I believe
in rewarding

00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,508
years of dedication
and devotion

00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,811
to this Department.

00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:19,846
I believe in Conrad Ecklie.

00:01:28,054 --> 00:01:30,523
For a proper introduction,
I'd like to turn

00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,860
to his good friend...
( <i>pager ringing</i> )

00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,195
...Supervisor
Gil Grissom.

( <i>applause</i> )

00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:39,666
Gil...

00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:41,935
I got a 419.

00:01:42,002 --> 00:01:43,370
Don't even think about it.

00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:44,671
Swing's tapped out.

00:01:44,738 --> 00:01:45,805
I'm the back-up.

00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:48,408
Here...

00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:50,076
you give my speech.

00:01:51,745 --> 00:01:53,280
Good luck, Conrad.

( <i>no audio</i> )

( <i>whispering, murmuring</i> )

00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:06,660

( <i>no audio</i> )

MAN:
<i>Hey, Griss...</i>

00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:23,877
What's with
the monkey suit?

00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:26,880
I was at a funeral
across the street.

00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:28,848
At a casino?

00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:29,883
My condolences.

00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,451
Scene's in
the east penthouse.

00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:33,286
Gotta use
the VIP elevator.

00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:34,421
Thanks.

00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:35,655
( <i>elevator bell dings</i> )

00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,931
Hey.

00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,700
Hello.

00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,571
What floor
did you want?

00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:53,506
Where do you think
I'm going?

00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:56,476
I wouldn't know.

00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:58,111
You don't
recognize me.

00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:00,847
Apparently not.

00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:04,251
In the lab, I usually
wear my hair up.

00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:07,888
Oh, yeah...

00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:08,955
You're pulling in

00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,123
when I'm pulling out.

00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,124
Sofia Curtis.

00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,225
CSI-Three, day shift.

00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:13,326
You work for Ecklie.

00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:16,296
As of tonight, so do you.

00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,169
Hey, Gil... hey, Sofie.

00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:25,772
Sorry to drag you away
from the Chicken Cordon Bleu.

00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:29,709
It's the McKinley High
Homecoming.

00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:33,280
The dance is downstairs,
but the cool kids' party

00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:35,515
is in here.

00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:43,056
CURTIS:
This place makes
the Rain Man suite at Caesar's

00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:44,991
look like my condo.

00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,127
These rooms are just
for whales and royalty.

00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:48,228
What's up?

00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:50,096
We're running down
the VIP host,

00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:52,399
see who's got it tonight.

00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:53,900
Okay,

00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:56,903
paramedics pronounced,
left the scene undisturbed.

00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,573
Name is Nicole Jensen, 17.

00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:01,007
Coroner's en route.

00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,777
I'm gonna talk
to the MTV generation.

00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,618
Where's your kit?

00:04:11,685 --> 00:04:13,787
I can send a uniform
to bring it up.

00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:24,864
Teenager abuses drugs
and/or booze...

00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,132
there's a news flash.

00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,774
Contusions on her neck.

00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:38,044
And the position suggests
she was grabbed from behind.

00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:42,315
CURTIS:
"A night to remember."

00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,920

Okay... so I talked
to the VIP host.

00:05:31,917 --> 00:05:34,253
The room was checked out
to Charlie Macklin.

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,388
It's his casino.

00:05:35,454 --> 00:05:37,490
Yeah, it's for his
daughter, Janelle.

00:05:37,556 --> 00:05:40,526
She's having
an after party with
her and her friends.

00:05:40,593 --> 00:05:42,028
Oh, off the streets
and out of trouble.

00:05:42,094 --> 00:05:44,463
Best laid plans.

00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:47,466
So what's
the daughter's story?

00:05:47,533 --> 00:05:49,068
You know, I don't know.

00:05:49,135 --> 00:05:50,436
We haven't seen her yet.

00:05:50,503 --> 00:05:51,704
We're still looking.

00:06:07,053 --> 00:06:08,754
( <i>chuckling</i> )

00:06:08,821 --> 00:06:09,855
I can barely move in this dress

00:06:09,922 --> 00:06:11,290
and we haven't cleared
the bathroom yet,

00:06:11,357 --> 00:06:13,726
so there it is.

00:06:13,793 --> 00:06:16,195
Don't worry,
I'm wearing underwear.

00:06:16,262 --> 00:06:18,331
As far as you know.

00:06:20,299 --> 00:06:21,834
( <i>camera shutter snapping</i> )

00:06:21,901 --> 00:06:24,303
PHILLIPS:
Liver temp is 97.2.

00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:26,772
She's been dead
less than two hours.

00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:28,374
Banana peel...

00:06:28,441 --> 00:06:30,743
G-string...

00:06:31,444 --> 00:06:32,845
Scared of that.

00:06:35,247 --> 00:06:37,216
Ligature marks
on both of her wrists.

00:06:40,086 --> 00:06:41,754
Some kind of adhesive residue,
too.

00:06:46,058 --> 00:06:47,493
( <i>whimpering</i> )

00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,062
So, she was bound?

00:06:53,499 --> 00:06:55,134
Marked impression
on her left cheek.

00:06:58,738 --> 00:07:02,008
Maybe some sort
of circular device

00:07:02,074 --> 00:07:03,876
pressed against her face?

00:07:06,512 --> 00:07:08,781
( <i>camera shutter clicking</i> )

00:07:08,848 --> 00:07:10,216
CURTIS:
No beer or liquor.

00:07:10,282 --> 00:07:13,185
Just water,

00:07:13,252 --> 00:07:14,987
yogurt, and OJ.

00:07:15,054 --> 00:07:19,659
Mixers, not for drinks...
maybe for drugs.

00:07:19,725 --> 00:07:23,329
Right pH in the stomach
speeds the buzz.

00:07:23,396 --> 00:07:25,831
I think there's narco
around here somewhere.

00:07:25,898 --> 00:07:28,668
A-A-Are you
talking to me?

00:07:28,734 --> 00:07:30,503
No.

00:07:30,569 --> 00:07:33,472
Do you always process like this?

00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:35,508
Like what?

00:07:35,574 --> 00:07:36,876
With your mouth.

00:07:36,942 --> 00:07:40,079
Whenever I meet someone new,

00:07:40,146 --> 00:07:42,448
I always say their name out loud
a few times.

00:07:42,515 --> 00:07:43,849
Keeps a picture in my head.

00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:45,351
Hm...

00:07:45,418 --> 00:07:47,687

we had cameras.

I got it, Miranda.

00:07:58,097 --> 00:07:59,065
I get the picture.

00:07:59,131 --> 00:08:00,266
I know what it means.

00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:04,036
The others came in,
and, uh...

00:08:04,103 --> 00:08:06,339
Someone tried CPR,
I guess.

00:08:06,405 --> 00:08:08,107
Didn't work.
We called 911.

00:08:08,174 --> 00:08:10,109
So, uh, you tight
with Nikki?

00:08:10,176 --> 00:08:11,877
God, no.

00:08:11,944 --> 00:08:13,779
Her dad was
a freelance limo driver.

00:08:13,846 --> 00:08:16,515
I mean, you have to have
a felony to get that job.

00:08:16,582 --> 00:08:19,218
( <i>chuckling</i> ):
How would you know that?

00:08:19,285 --> 00:08:21,120
Everybody knows that.

Whatever.
The guy Joe Pesci played.

00:08:29,528 --> 00:08:30,730
Tony "The Ant" Spilotro.

00:08:30,796 --> 00:08:32,732
Well, he and Nikki's dad
were friends.

00:08:32,798 --> 00:08:33,799
Oh, yeah?

00:08:33,866 --> 00:08:35,868
In real life.

00:08:35,935 --> 00:08:37,570
Real lowlifes.

00:08:37,636 --> 00:08:40,840
That girl was Kryptonite to me.

00:08:40,906 --> 00:08:43,743
I'd be lying if I said
any different.

00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:46,512
STOKES:
Kids have been going in and out
of the suite all night,

00:08:46,579 --> 00:08:49,181
but the front desk
only issued card
keys to seven.

00:08:49,248 --> 00:08:51,017
Brass has five
of them upstairs...

00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:55,888
uh, Janelle Macklin
and Sean Paland
are unaccounted for,

00:08:55,955 --> 00:08:57,890
so I'll check the casino.

00:08:57,957 --> 00:09:00,092
I thought you were going
to process the scene
with Grissom.

00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,094
I was. He said
he had it covered.

00:09:02,161 --> 00:09:04,296
Sofia Curtis is up
there with him.

00:09:04,363 --> 00:09:07,266
Right...
Ecklie's right hand.

00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:08,467
Ever do a case with her?

00:09:08,534 --> 00:09:09,769
Uh-uh.

00:09:09,835 --> 00:09:11,837
Hey, I heard Grissom
stuck you with his speech.

00:09:11,904 --> 00:09:15,107
A napkin is not a speech.

00:09:15,174 --> 00:09:17,009
I'm going to need
to see everybody

00:09:17,076 --> 00:09:19,045
who went in or out
of the east penthouse

00:09:19,111 --> 00:09:20,146
since check-in,

00:09:20,212 --> 00:09:23,649
and that includes stairwells
and service entrances.

00:09:23,716 --> 00:09:26,819
You know,
that's Janelle Macklin's suite.

00:09:26,886 --> 00:09:28,587
Yeah, I know.

00:09:28,654 --> 00:09:30,523
Her father owns the casino.

00:09:30,589 --> 00:09:33,459
Okay...

00:09:35,494 --> 00:09:38,831
Dance is still
going strong.

00:09:38,898 --> 00:09:41,834
That's the beauty of high school
in Las Vegas.

00:09:41,901 --> 00:09:43,636
Homecoming
in a casino,

00:09:43,703 --> 00:09:46,038
dance can go all night.

( <i>hip-hop music playing</i> )

00:09:50,042 --> 00:09:52,311
I've been down here
dancing for hours.

00:09:52,378 --> 00:09:53,512
Ask anybody.

00:09:53,579 --> 00:09:54,847
Why don't you come
over here

00:09:54,914 --> 00:09:56,148
and talk to me
for a second?

00:09:56,215 --> 00:09:57,183
Come on, man!

00:09:57,249 --> 00:09:58,551
What, you need to tell
your date?

00:09:58,617 --> 00:10:00,086
I came stag.
Come here.

00:10:00,152 --> 00:10:02,388
If I want a date,
I'll get one in there.

00:10:02,455 --> 00:10:05,057
You know how many couples
break up at Homecoming?

00:10:05,124 --> 00:10:06,092
I looked it up.

00:10:06,158 --> 00:10:08,294
It's like ten percent.
Staggering.

00:10:08,361 --> 00:10:10,896
Hm... you hang out with Nikki
a lot?

00:10:10,963 --> 00:10:13,532
Please-- the girl's a scarf.

00:10:13,599 --> 00:10:16,369
Always hanging on the neck
of anyone with loot.

00:10:16,435 --> 00:10:19,372
Is that what was she doing
up in the P. Diddy suite

00:10:19,438 --> 00:10:20,639
with your buddies?

00:10:20,706 --> 00:10:23,676
Guess everybody wanted in
on that party.

00:10:23,743 --> 00:10:26,479
And Nikki wasn't on the list.

00:10:26,545 --> 00:10:27,646
Hey, wait, Janelle...

00:10:27,713 --> 00:10:28,647
Janelle, wait!

00:10:28,714 --> 00:10:29,749
Look, Nikki,
it's no big deal.

00:10:29,815 --> 00:10:30,816
You're not
missing anything.

00:10:30,883 --> 00:10:32,251
That's easy for you
to say.

00:10:32,318 --> 00:10:33,619
C'mon, Janelle,
we're seniors.

00:10:33,686 --> 00:10:35,187
This is my last
homecoming-- please!

00:10:35,254 --> 00:10:37,823
Janelle's
always taking in strays.

00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:39,392
Yeah, Janelle...

00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:40,726
Do you know where Janelle
is now?

00:10:40,793 --> 00:10:42,194
I have no idea.

00:10:42,261 --> 00:10:44,030
You know, when
I busted outta there,

00:10:44,096 --> 00:10:46,532
she was still up there chillin'
with the rest of them.

00:10:46,599 --> 00:10:49,201
ROBBINS:
Standard SAE kit was collected.

00:10:49,268 --> 00:10:51,537
Physical finding
of sexual activity.

00:10:51,604 --> 00:10:54,540
Unable to determine
if consensual or rape.

00:10:54,607 --> 00:10:56,642
Collected heart blood sample.

00:10:56,709 --> 00:11:02,114
Preliminary tox indicates
psilocybin, MDMA,

00:11:02,181 --> 00:11:03,215
and THC in the system.

00:11:03,282 --> 00:11:05,117
<i>Green-colored fiber</i>

00:11:05,184 --> 00:11:07,720
<i>was collected</i>
<i>from the nasal passages...</i>

00:11:07,787 --> 00:11:12,091
to be forwarded
to Trace Evidence for analysis.

00:11:12,158 --> 00:11:13,759
Vomitus mass was found
in the throat and lungs

00:11:13,826 --> 00:11:14,927
and there was

00:11:14,994 --> 00:11:18,230
petecchial hemorrhaging
of the lower eyelids.

00:11:18,297 --> 00:11:22,335
Preliminary C.O.D. appears
to be mechanical asphyxia

00:11:22,401 --> 00:11:25,037
from aspiration
of gastric content

00:11:25,104 --> 00:11:27,573
as a result of acute
drug intoxication.

00:11:30,776 --> 00:11:37,416
Albert Robbins, M.E.,
employee number 228369.

00:11:51,831 --> 00:11:55,134
CURTIS:
Collected seven
used condoms
from two bedrooms--

00:11:55,201 --> 00:11:57,870
not a record
in my book.

00:11:57,937 --> 00:11:59,872
Fact that the victim's
wrists were bound

00:11:59,939 --> 00:12:02,441
suggests possible
sex games.

00:12:02,508 --> 00:12:04,877
Also pulled a plastic
Baggie from a toilet

00:12:04,944 --> 00:12:07,646
containing what looks
like ground-up mushrooms,

00:12:07,713 --> 00:12:10,750
probably not the kind
you put on pizza.

00:12:10,816 --> 00:12:13,819
Could be the source
of the psilocybin.

00:12:13,886 --> 00:12:15,321
One of those kids
is still holding.

00:12:15,388 --> 00:12:16,889
I'm gonna
let Brass know.

00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:22,194
That time I was
talking to you.

00:12:22,261 --> 00:12:23,996
What?

00:12:24,063 --> 00:12:25,297
Sorry.

00:12:25,364 --> 00:12:29,301
I was, uh, treating it
like white noise.

00:12:31,237 --> 00:12:32,471
What are you seeing?

00:12:32,538 --> 00:12:34,707
Chicken Cordon Bleu.

00:12:34,774 --> 00:12:38,477
Okay, there's no evidence
of that meal anywhere here,

00:12:38,544 --> 00:12:40,446
and Ecklie
always said you

00:12:40,513 --> 00:12:42,148
had an odd sense of humor,

00:12:42,214 --> 00:12:44,316
so that would make this
a joke.

00:12:46,319 --> 00:12:47,887
Not really.

00:12:47,953 --> 00:12:51,557
If you're on your feet
when you're throwing up,
the vomit goes everywhere.

00:12:51,624 --> 00:12:54,894
<i>The higher you are,</i>
<i>the wider the splash, right?</i>

00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,196
But...

00:12:57,263 --> 00:12:59,932
this vomit is confined
to one specific area.

00:13:01,667 --> 00:13:03,836
So she was probably
lying down

00:13:03,903 --> 00:13:05,237
when she was throwing up.

00:13:05,304 --> 00:13:06,972
Maybe unconscious.

00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:08,841
Or already dead.

00:13:08,908 --> 00:13:11,510
Vomit could've been forced out
by CPR compressions.

00:13:11,577 --> 00:13:13,679
But that doesn't explain
the bruise on her cheek.

00:13:13,746 --> 00:13:15,848
Or the green fibers in her nose.

00:13:32,898 --> 00:13:34,200
Well...

00:13:34,266 --> 00:13:35,735
may have started here.

00:13:35,801 --> 00:13:37,436
( <i>shouting</i> )

00:13:37,503 --> 00:13:40,339
Stop it! Stop it!

00:13:40,406 --> 00:13:41,640
( <i>shouting continues</i> )

00:13:49,915 --> 00:13:51,317
Come on, you're
all done-- let's go.

00:13:51,384 --> 00:13:52,218
What do you mean?

00:13:52,284 --> 00:13:53,219
We know you're
dealing drugs.

00:13:53,285 --> 00:13:54,820
Nikki Jensen's dead
because of you.

00:13:54,887 --> 00:13:57,690
No, okay, wait, okay,
I don't even do... I
don't even drink, okay?

00:13:57,757 --> 00:14:02,061
You don't... you don't want
me, you... you want Rex.

00:14:03,763 --> 00:14:05,798
Hey, Rex.

00:14:07,366 --> 00:14:09,335
Look, my name is Gavin.

00:14:09,402 --> 00:14:10,870
You got my license, check it.

00:14:10,936 --> 00:14:14,240
No, no, it's "Rex,"
you know, as in RX.

00:14:14,306 --> 00:14:16,976
I guess it's a lot more subtle
than "drugstore," right?

00:14:17,043 --> 00:14:19,311
I got nothing to do
with drugs, my man.

00:14:19,378 --> 00:14:20,346
You already searched me.

00:14:20,413 --> 00:14:22,548
Is there anywhere else
you care to look?

00:14:22,615 --> 00:14:25,284
Hey, you better save
that position for
later, brother.

00:14:25,351 --> 00:14:27,186
You're gonna need it,
where you're going.

00:14:27,253 --> 00:14:28,287
Is this our dealer?

00:14:28,354 --> 00:14:29,322
Oh, yeah.

00:14:29,388 --> 00:14:32,091
Get this straight, okay?
I'm not a drug dealer.

00:14:32,158 --> 00:14:33,559
My dad owns seven restaurants,

00:14:33,626 --> 00:14:36,262
including one at the Bellagio
and the gourmet room downstairs.

00:14:36,329 --> 00:14:37,997
I don't need drug money.

00:14:38,064 --> 00:14:40,766
Well, maybe you just like
getting your friends high.

00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:43,269
There's a song about that,
I think.

00:14:57,249 --> 00:14:58,284
Hold out your hand.

00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,822
Duct tape residue.

00:15:02,888 --> 00:15:04,223
What do you know?

00:15:06,993 --> 00:15:10,162
You know, if the water
is relatively still,

00:15:10,229 --> 00:15:12,098
submerged prints

00:15:12,164 --> 00:15:14,400
can remain for weeks, months,
sometimes even years.

00:15:22,308 --> 00:15:24,110
Thank you.

00:15:24,176 --> 00:15:26,979
When we match your prints
on this bag,

00:15:27,046 --> 00:15:28,514
you'll be charged with murder.

00:15:47,633 --> 00:15:49,568
I didn't give Nikki anything.

00:15:49,635 --> 00:15:51,170
The 'shrooms were for the room.

00:15:51,237 --> 00:15:54,273
She was diving in there
with both hands, and...

00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,374
Did you have sex with her?

00:15:55,441 --> 00:15:56,909
So what if I did?

00:15:56,976 --> 00:15:59,245
She was... giving it away.

00:15:59,311 --> 00:16:02,148
You tied her up and forced her
down on the couch.

00:16:02,214 --> 00:16:04,150
That wasn't me.

00:16:04,216 --> 00:16:09,822
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

00:16:09,889 --> 00:16:11,357
Grissom.

00:16:11,424 --> 00:16:13,492
WILLOWS:
I just found Janelle Macklin.

00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:15,328
Good. We need to talk to her
right away.

00:16:15,394 --> 00:16:17,596
That's going to be tough.

00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:26,762
( <i>indistinct conversation</i> )

00:16:30,265 --> 00:16:32,634
Everybody hit the floor!
Now! Now!

00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:33,969
Now! Now!

00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:39,475
They had duct tape.

00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:44,213
They tied everyone up,
and they dragged Janelle out.

00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:46,582
So how did Nikki
end up dead?

00:16:48,584 --> 00:16:50,586
Um...

00:16:50,652 --> 00:16:52,020
eventually, we all...

00:16:52,087 --> 00:16:54,022
got ourselves free.

00:16:54,089 --> 00:16:58,927
Everybody was scared,
but Nikki was possessed.

00:16:58,994 --> 00:17:01,563
She was wasted.
Freaking out.

00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:03,065
No! I'm leaving!
Shut up!

00:17:03,132 --> 00:17:05,534
Shut up!
Shut her up!

00:17:05,601 --> 00:17:06,702
BOY:
Friggin' 'shrooms!

00:17:06,769 --> 00:17:08,103
Chill, will ya?!

00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:11,073
( <i>grunting)</i>
( <i>screaming</i> )

00:17:12,808 --> 00:17:15,010
We weren't trying
to hurt her.

00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:17,179
Well, that's for the DA
to decide.

00:17:19,314 --> 00:17:21,183
Why try to hide the kidnapping?

00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,919
MAN:
<i>I told the kids</i>
<i>not to report it.</i>

00:17:23,986 --> 00:17:26,121
And I told 'em
not to leave the room.

00:17:26,188 --> 00:17:28,290
They were smart enough
to listen.

00:17:28,357 --> 00:17:30,893
Janelle's fine.
It's a game.

00:17:30,959 --> 00:17:33,929
ATWATER:
You know, Mr. Macklin, based on
the surveillance videotape...

00:17:33,996 --> 00:17:35,164
I've seen it.

00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:37,533
Your daughter looked terrified.

00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:39,835
She does school plays.

00:17:39,902 --> 00:17:41,737
Says she wants to be an actor.

00:17:41,804 --> 00:17:43,305
At least that's the story
this month.

00:17:43,372 --> 00:17:45,808
So you think
this is all an act?

00:17:45,874 --> 00:17:47,676
Daddy's little girl
begging for attention.

00:17:47,743 --> 00:17:49,445
Right on the button.

00:17:49,511 --> 00:17:52,047
Let me tell you
about Janelle:

00:17:52,114 --> 00:17:54,149
I sent her to a nice prep school
back east,

00:17:54,216 --> 00:17:55,951
she flunked out
on purpose.

00:17:56,018 --> 00:17:58,020
I gave her a Bentley
for her sweet 16,

00:17:58,087 --> 00:17:59,822
she wraps it around a tree.

00:17:59,888 --> 00:18:02,124
I've been putting up
with this crap since
she was a kid.

00:18:02,191 --> 00:18:03,559
I'm done.

00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:06,061
When was the last time
you actually talked
to your daughter?

00:18:06,128 --> 00:18:08,630
Yesterday, when she asked me
to comp the suite.

00:18:10,566 --> 00:18:13,368
You want me to call her, fine.

00:18:13,435 --> 00:18:16,038
She never goes anywhere
without her cell phone.

00:18:16,105 --> 00:18:19,274
( <i>ringing tone</i> )

00:18:19,341 --> 00:18:20,743
DIGITIZED VOICE:
We have Janelle.

00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:24,847
Wire one million U.S. dollars
to Grand Caymans National Bank,

00:18:24,913 --> 00:18:29,051
account number 489-27-63.

00:18:29,118 --> 00:18:33,756
If the money is not deposited
within 24 hours, she dies.

00:18:35,624 --> 00:18:37,793
I take it that's not
her usual greeting.

00:18:39,528 --> 00:18:41,530
If this is a game,
why ask for money?

00:18:41,597 --> 00:18:43,232
She obviously doesn't need it.

00:18:43,298 --> 00:18:46,335
I pay, she wins.

00:18:46,401 --> 00:18:47,703
You want to know
why the "abductors"

00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:49,538
want the money wired
to the Caymans?

00:18:49,605 --> 00:18:50,606
Smart move.

00:18:50,672 --> 00:18:53,308
Most kidnappers do get busted
at the drop.

00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:55,310
That's where Janelle
has her trust is set up.

00:18:55,377 --> 00:18:57,246
She knows how those banks work.

00:18:57,312 --> 00:18:59,047
When Steve Wynn's daughter
was kidnapped,

00:18:59,114 --> 00:19:00,516
he didn't tell the police.

00:19:00,582 --> 00:19:02,284
He went to the Mirage
casino floor,

00:19:02,351 --> 00:19:06,455
he got 1.4 million in
cash, he made the drop...

00:19:06,522 --> 00:19:08,023
Got his daughter back
in a couple hours.

00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:10,392
Yeah, I know the story.

00:19:10,459 --> 00:19:12,795
Steve Wynn's daughter
was a real victim.

00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:14,163
Janelle isn't.

00:19:14,229 --> 00:19:15,564
Game or not, Mr. Macklin,

00:19:15,631 --> 00:19:16,932
one girl is dead

00:19:16,999 --> 00:19:19,067
your daughter is missing.

00:19:19,134 --> 00:19:20,736
We're compelled
to investigate here.

00:19:20,803 --> 00:19:22,738
You do that.

00:19:22,805 --> 00:19:24,673
And when Janelle turns up,
crying,

00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,675
saying how sorry she is,

00:19:26,742 --> 00:19:27,810
you make sure
she answers for it.

00:19:45,294 --> 00:19:47,930
Mr. Jensen, your daughter's
personal effects

00:19:47,996 --> 00:19:49,598
are at the front desk.

00:20:03,645 --> 00:20:06,882
Least you got your money's worth
out of the rental.

00:20:09,084 --> 00:20:10,252
I just wanted to let you know,

00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:13,021
no hard feelings about
you leaving the banquet.

00:20:13,088 --> 00:20:15,190
You're just...
doing your job.

00:20:18,861 --> 00:20:20,028
Have you decided yet

00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:22,231
who's going to be
the day shift supervisor?

00:20:25,067 --> 00:20:27,336
Well, Sofia's
a logical choice,

00:20:27,402 --> 00:20:28,704
but nothing's
official yet.

00:20:28,771 --> 00:20:31,774
You should consider Catherine.
She's earned it.

00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,742
I'll, uh, I'll give it
some thought.

00:20:35,244 --> 00:20:37,479
Oh, you know...

00:20:37,546 --> 00:20:39,715
I'd love to get
a copy of your speech.

00:20:39,782 --> 00:20:44,386
Just a little souvenir
for my scrapbook.

00:20:44,453 --> 00:20:46,388
I'll get you a copy.

00:20:46,455 --> 00:20:47,589
That'd be great.

00:20:51,393 --> 00:20:53,095
WILLOWS:
Tell me something.

00:20:53,162 --> 00:20:55,063
SANDERS:
I think my eyes need Band-Aids.

00:20:56,331 --> 00:20:58,700
WILLOWS:
Tough shift.

00:20:58,767 --> 00:21:00,669
You did say
"shift," right?

00:21:01,904 --> 00:21:05,374
SANDERS:
I reviewed roughly eight hours

00:21:05,441 --> 00:21:07,576
of video surveillance
you so generously provided.

00:21:07,643 --> 00:21:09,411
Janelle Macklin

00:21:09,478 --> 00:21:11,480
and several friends
rode the VIP elevator

00:21:11,547 --> 00:21:13,449
to the penthouse
around 8:00 p.m.

00:21:13,515 --> 00:21:16,218
The only other time Janelle
set foot in the elevator...

00:21:16,285 --> 00:21:17,753
she was a ransom note.

00:21:21,657 --> 00:21:24,960
Well, we know they didn't take
the VIP elevator <i>down...</i>

00:21:25,027 --> 00:21:26,495
And, based on the video,

00:21:26,562 --> 00:21:27,596
they didn't use the stairs

00:21:27,663 --> 00:21:30,566
or the service elevator,
either.

00:21:30,632 --> 00:21:32,468
Maybe's she's still
in the suite.

00:21:33,802 --> 00:21:35,437
It's a big room.

00:21:41,744 --> 00:21:45,047
Man, there must
be over a hundred
shoeprints in here.

00:21:45,114 --> 00:21:47,416
WILLOWS:
Even more fingerprints
on those buttons.

00:21:47,483 --> 00:21:49,384
Good luck.

00:21:50,986 --> 00:21:52,654
Thanks a lot.

00:21:53,989 --> 00:21:55,491
How's it going?

00:21:55,557 --> 00:21:56,892
Great.

00:21:56,959 --> 00:21:58,827
Got all the towels
we need here.

00:21:58,894 --> 00:22:00,028
Yeah...

00:22:00,095 --> 00:22:02,664
I might stick a few of those
in my trunk.

00:22:05,934 --> 00:22:08,370
The same costumes
as the kidnappers.

00:22:11,273 --> 00:22:14,476
These guys definitely knew
their way around this hotel.

00:22:14,543 --> 00:22:16,512
Yeah.

00:22:59,488 --> 00:23:01,490
Hey, Catherine...

00:23:06,228 --> 00:23:09,064
...got everything we need
for Halloween except the candy.

00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,437
The abductors exposed their
faces to Janelle Macklin.

00:23:15,504 --> 00:23:17,406
That's one of two things--

00:23:17,473 --> 00:23:21,477
either she knew them,
or they were going to whack her.

00:23:46,135 --> 00:23:48,637
BRISTOL:
Look, I don't know why
you had to drag me down here

00:23:48,704 --> 00:23:50,272
on my day off.

00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,467
What's this, Kenny?

00:24:18,534 --> 00:24:20,903
I don't know.

00:24:20,969 --> 00:24:23,238
Sure you do.

00:24:24,506 --> 00:24:26,909
A digital video
time-delay.

00:24:26,975 --> 00:24:30,813
TiVo-ing the casino.

00:24:30,879 --> 00:24:33,515
Now that's ballsy.

00:24:35,017 --> 00:24:38,487
You time-shifted the signal

00:24:38,554 --> 00:24:41,824
from the west penthouse
service elevator

00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:46,428
and you fed it
to the east monitor.

00:24:56,538 --> 00:24:58,273
You were in on it.

00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:01,376
Janelle asked me
to do her a favor.

00:25:01,443 --> 00:25:03,212
I really like her.

00:25:03,278 --> 00:25:06,782
You know, I practically
watched her grow up,

00:25:06,849 --> 00:25:08,050
I mean, through the...

00:25:08,117 --> 00:25:10,252
cameras.

00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:12,087
( <i>sniffling</i> )

00:25:12,154 --> 00:25:14,923
I'm so fired.

00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:16,725
I screwed with
Charlie Macklin.

00:25:16,792 --> 00:25:18,060
I'm probably dead.

00:25:18,127 --> 00:25:19,695
Where is she?

00:25:19,762 --> 00:25:21,396
I don't know.

00:25:21,463 --> 00:25:25,534
She said she wanted to sneak
some guys up to her suite

00:25:25,601 --> 00:25:28,303
that Mr. Macklin
wouldn't like.

00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:29,304
What was I supposed to do?

00:25:29,371 --> 00:25:30,372
I mean,
she's the boss' daughter.

00:25:30,439 --> 00:25:31,373
She's also

00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,374
a person of interest

00:25:32,441 --> 00:25:33,742
in the death of Nicole Jensen.

00:25:33,809 --> 00:25:35,411
If you know anything...

00:25:35,477 --> 00:25:38,547
I'm telling you,
I don't know where she is.

00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:52,094
GRISSOM:
Definitely not synthetic.

00:25:52,161 --> 00:25:56,331
Medulla is 14 microns
in diameter.

00:25:56,398 --> 00:25:58,200
Continuous cortex.

00:25:58,267 --> 00:26:01,370
Imbricate scales.

00:26:03,338 --> 00:26:05,707
I'm thinking sheep.

00:26:17,186 --> 00:26:18,620
Merino.

00:26:18,687 --> 00:26:21,090
Fine wool for
fine fabrics.

00:26:21,156 --> 00:26:23,959
Why are you talking
to yourself?

00:26:24,026 --> 00:26:26,095
I'm trying a new technique.

00:26:26,161 --> 00:26:27,129
Is it working?

00:26:27,196 --> 00:26:28,897
I have no idea.

00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:37,172
Aniline dye.

00:26:37,239 --> 00:26:40,776
Most likely BASF or Dupont.

00:26:40,843 --> 00:26:43,712
Probably used by every high-end
garment maker in the world.

00:26:43,779 --> 00:26:46,715
And black wool is definitely
not used for party dresses.

00:26:46,782 --> 00:26:49,618
So it's got to be from those
tuxedo boys in the suite.

00:26:49,685 --> 00:26:52,755
You'll have to take
their clothes.

00:27:03,999 --> 00:27:06,135
BRASS:
Thread's from your tux, kid.

00:27:06,201 --> 00:27:08,103
Nothing's going
to change that.

00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:12,975
So the DA's offered you immunity
in Nicole Jensen's death

00:27:13,041 --> 00:27:14,209
for your full cooperation

00:27:14,276 --> 00:27:15,944
in the kidnapping
of Janelle Macklin.

00:27:16,011 --> 00:27:17,045
Let's hear it.

00:27:19,314 --> 00:27:21,250
All right, straight up.

00:27:21,316 --> 00:27:22,684
Janelle hired
an eye-in-the-sky geek

00:27:22,751 --> 00:27:24,620
to knock out the cameras
in the service area.

00:27:28,056 --> 00:27:30,392
We swooped in, scooped her out,

00:27:30,459 --> 00:27:32,928
and bam, I mean,
we were over it.

00:27:32,995 --> 00:27:35,164
So she paid you to kidnap her?

00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:37,166
No. I wouldn't take a penny
from Janelle.

00:27:37,232 --> 00:27:39,034
We've been friends
since grade school.

00:27:39,101 --> 00:27:42,337
Oh, so you did it out of the
goodness of your own heart.

00:27:42,404 --> 00:27:44,506
Look, my parents have dealt
cards for 20 years, all right?

00:27:44,573 --> 00:27:45,541
I didn't grow up with squat.

00:27:45,607 --> 00:27:46,942
Janelle, she didn't care
about that.

00:27:47,009 --> 00:27:48,510
She still
kicked it with me.

00:27:48,577 --> 00:27:51,447
So when she asked for my help,
I helped.

00:27:51,513 --> 00:27:53,615
Even if it involved
several felonies?

00:27:53,682 --> 00:27:55,784
I wasn't even
thinking about that.

00:27:55,851 --> 00:27:57,019
You don't even get it.

00:27:57,086 --> 00:27:58,787
You don't understand
what it's like

00:27:58,854 --> 00:28:00,155
to be born
and raised here.

00:28:00,222 --> 00:28:01,657
I mean, Vegas was a dirt lot
until the '60s.

00:28:01,723 --> 00:28:02,791
I mean, it's lucky

00:28:02,858 --> 00:28:04,026
that I'm not a drug dealer,

00:28:04,093 --> 00:28:06,829
and Mr. Mack should be happy
Janelle's not a junkie stripper.

00:28:06,895 --> 00:28:08,397
I mean,
he was never there for her

00:28:08,464 --> 00:28:09,598
like my parents
were there for me.

00:28:09,665 --> 00:28:11,266
They instilled good
values in my head.

00:28:11,333 --> 00:28:12,501
Like kidnapping?

00:28:14,203 --> 00:28:15,304
Who's your partner?

00:28:17,206 --> 00:28:19,074
Look, counselor, you better
educate your client

00:28:19,141 --> 00:28:20,542
on the meaning
of full cooperation.

00:28:20,609 --> 00:28:22,478
Uh-uh, nah. Vegas has
got too many rats,

00:28:22,544 --> 00:28:24,847
and I'm not gonna
be one of them.

00:28:24,913 --> 00:28:27,015
You want to know where
Janelle is, I'll tell you.

00:28:27,082 --> 00:28:28,684
But you're not going
to believe me.

00:28:28,751 --> 00:28:31,253
Try me.

00:28:35,224 --> 00:28:36,959
( <i>loud knocking</i> )

00:28:41,463 --> 00:28:46,368
( <i>cartoon music plays</i>
<i>on TV</i> )

00:28:48,637 --> 00:28:49,571
Don't, don't...

00:28:49,638 --> 00:28:51,607
Do it! Do it!
No, son! No!

00:28:57,291 --> 00:28:59,416
Why did you volunteer
to take a polygraph test?

00:28:59,916 --> 00:29:01,618
I want to clear my name.

00:29:01,685 --> 00:29:04,054
What crime have you
been accused of?

00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:07,390
Kidnapping Janelle Macklin.

00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:28,445
( <i>screaming</i> )

00:29:31,982 --> 00:29:34,150
Did you physically assault
Janelle Macklin?

00:29:34,217 --> 00:29:36,052
No way.

00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:38,755
Did your partner assault
Janelle Macklin?

00:29:38,822 --> 00:29:40,390
No.

00:29:42,325 --> 00:29:44,661
I don't know.

00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:55,171
Did you kill Janelle Macklin?

00:29:55,238 --> 00:29:56,740
No.

00:29:56,806 --> 00:29:59,242
Do you know where she is now?

00:29:59,309 --> 00:30:01,244
No.

00:30:01,311 --> 00:30:03,013
It was just a prank.

00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:04,881
WILLOWS:
"Not deceptive."

00:30:04,948 --> 00:30:07,651
So, Dean Tate was
telling the truth.

00:30:07,717 --> 00:30:10,654
Well, according
to the polygraph, yeah.

00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,922
Hey, guys, I got

00:30:11,988 --> 00:30:14,791
a work card hit off
of that maple syrup print.

00:30:14,858 --> 00:30:17,994
Let me guess.
Mrs. Butterworth?

00:30:18,061 --> 00:30:21,197
What are you accusing me
of, eating French toast?

00:30:21,264 --> 00:30:23,767
What, eating carbs
is against the law now?

00:30:23,833 --> 00:30:25,635
No, but kidnapping is.

00:30:25,702 --> 00:30:27,137
I don't know anything
about that.

00:30:27,203 --> 00:30:29,739
My prints are in that room
because it was Deano's room.

00:30:29,806 --> 00:30:31,174
He got it so we'd have a place

00:30:31,241 --> 00:30:32,876
to bring the ladies
after the dance.

00:30:32,943 --> 00:30:35,145
So you're telling me when I take
a sample of your DNA

00:30:35,211 --> 00:30:36,680
and compare it

00:30:36,746 --> 00:30:38,582
to the kabuki masks here...

00:30:39,716 --> 00:30:41,184
that's not going to be you?

00:30:47,557 --> 00:30:49,326
Deano rat me?

00:30:49,392 --> 00:30:52,195
No. No, the evidence did that.

00:30:55,098 --> 00:30:57,500
Look, we were playing around.

00:30:57,567 --> 00:31:00,503
I bus tables every day
after school, all right?

00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:02,872
A grand's a lot of dough for me.

00:31:02,939 --> 00:31:05,609
You know,
this was a joke.

00:31:05,675 --> 00:31:07,677
You see us laughing?

00:31:09,045 --> 00:31:10,914
Where's Janelle?

00:31:10,981 --> 00:31:12,415
I don't know.

00:31:12,482 --> 00:31:13,717
When's the last time
you saw her?

00:31:13,783 --> 00:31:15,285
After the kidnapping.

00:31:15,352 --> 00:31:17,654
Janelle planted one on my lips.

00:31:17,721 --> 00:31:19,322
You know, to thank me.

00:31:19,389 --> 00:31:21,324
I felt it was
more than that.

00:31:21,391 --> 00:31:22,525
You know, I felt a vibe.

00:31:22,592 --> 00:31:26,596
I gave her an hour to chill,
then I called her.

00:31:26,663 --> 00:31:28,298
Asked her if I could
bring her anything.

00:31:28,365 --> 00:31:29,699
She said she was kind of hungry,

00:31:29,766 --> 00:31:31,935
so I told her I'd bring her
something sweet to eat,

00:31:32,002 --> 00:31:33,003
other than me.

00:31:34,504 --> 00:31:37,641
<i>For a couple seconds,</i>
<i>I thought I was in.</i>

00:31:37,707 --> 00:31:40,010
<i>Then she got a voice mail...</i>

00:31:40,076 --> 00:31:43,179
<i>checked it and flipped out.</i>

00:31:43,246 --> 00:31:45,248
( <i>glass shattering</i> )

00:31:50,453 --> 00:31:52,923
I figured that was
my cue to bolt,

00:31:52,989 --> 00:31:55,859
so I rolled back down
to the dance

00:31:55,926 --> 00:31:58,295
to continue with the honeys
I was already working.

00:31:58,361 --> 00:32:00,563
I haven't seen Janelle since.
I swear to God.

00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:03,099
WILLOWS:
Well, there he is,

00:32:03,166 --> 00:32:06,336
stepping onto
the main elevator
from the 15th floor.

00:32:06,403 --> 00:32:07,704
Alone.

00:32:07,771 --> 00:32:11,107
( <i>Willows snickering</i> )

I'm really disappointed
with you, Janelle.

All these years you spent
around me at the casino

something like this over on me?

you tonight
