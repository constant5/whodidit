Female, early 30s,
Hispanic descent,

00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,837
vitreous potassium was 11.74
milli-equivalents per liter,

00:03:01,904 --> 00:03:05,174
so PMI's approximately
six hours.

00:03:05,241 --> 00:03:07,743
So time of death
roughly 1:00 a.m.

00:03:08,844 --> 00:03:10,012
C.O.D.?

00:03:10,079 --> 00:03:11,714
From what I got here,
I can't tell you much.

00:03:11,781 --> 00:03:13,649
Minimal dilation in the pupils

00:03:13,716 --> 00:03:17,286
indicates decapitation
was postmortem.

00:03:17,353 --> 00:03:19,555
Scalp shows naked follicles
without hairs,

00:03:19,622 --> 00:03:22,124
no inflammation around them
indicates

00:03:22,191 --> 00:03:24,360
removal was postmortem as well.

00:03:24,427 --> 00:03:26,195
Ripped out in chunks.

00:03:27,963 --> 00:03:30,466
Takes time and dedication
to do something like that.

00:03:30,533 --> 00:03:31,500
And a lot

00:03:31,567 --> 00:03:32,601
of hatred.

00:03:32,668 --> 00:03:36,172
So her eyebrows
have been shaved off

00:03:36,238 --> 00:03:37,406
and drawn back on
with eyeliner.

00:03:37,473 --> 00:03:40,543
I know that's popular
among Latinos in 28th Street.

00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:42,993
She could be a banger

00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,395
or a girlfriend of one.

00:03:44,461 --> 00:03:48,065
Either way at least,
she took good care of her teeth.

00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:53,542
What is that, nine digits?

00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,043
Social Security number.

00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:58,580
Dentists usually put on
some form of identification

00:03:58,647 --> 00:04:00,315
on removable bridgework.

00:04:00,382 --> 00:04:02,284
It's better
than a license plate.

00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:28,710
Pulled a couple
of likely palm prints

00:04:28,777 --> 00:04:30,545
on the newspaper
the head was on,

00:04:30,612 --> 00:04:31,980
but I don't think
that's going

00:04:32,047 --> 00:04:33,014
to be our best bet.

00:04:33,081 --> 00:04:34,483
Okay, start with those,

00:04:34,549 --> 00:04:37,018
but make sure
you run the partials
off the box as well

00:04:37,085 --> 00:04:38,453
'cause I got
Ecklie looking
over my shoulder,

00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,588
so, uh...

00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:40,622
Cover your ass.

00:04:40,689 --> 00:04:42,624
Yes.
My pleasure.

00:04:42,691 --> 00:04:45,427
WOMAN:
Large, elevated
vertebral scales.

00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:47,629
Definitely not your
typical U.S. <i>Crotalus.</i>

00:04:47,696 --> 00:04:50,098
Herpetologists always
throwing the Latin around.

00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:52,534
What's wrong with just
calling him "rattlesnake"?

00:04:52,601 --> 00:04:55,103
My specialty, my jargon.

00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,038
Stripes at
the base of the neck

00:04:57,105 --> 00:04:59,574
makes it <i>Crotalus simus,</i>

00:04:59,641 --> 00:05:01,610
indigenous to southern
coastal Mexico.

00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:03,979
Apparent Mexican vic
on a Mexican newspaper

00:05:04,046 --> 00:05:05,180
with a Mexican snake.

00:05:05,247 --> 00:05:06,448
You don't find
a whole lot

00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:08,784
of these buzz-worms
around Vegas anyway, do you?

00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,585
Nowhere outside a zoo.

00:05:10,652 --> 00:05:12,988
These snakes like to burrow
in damp soil.

00:05:13,055 --> 00:05:15,023
They like it hot and humid.

00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:16,191
We're hot and dry.

00:05:16,258 --> 00:05:17,626
For a snake,
big difference.

00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:18,860
What are the chances

00:05:18,927 --> 00:05:20,896
that thing just
crawled in their on its own?

00:05:20,962 --> 00:05:22,264
In a newspaper dispenser

00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:24,032
in the middle of a desert city?

00:05:24,099 --> 00:05:25,467
No way.

00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:26,935
I think it was dead
when it was shoved

00:05:27,002 --> 00:05:28,003
down the victim's throat.

00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,318
BRASS:
The only car up here.

00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:44,586
Security called it in.

00:05:44,653 --> 00:05:46,254
Is that a handicap van?

00:05:46,321 --> 00:05:47,723
Dead guy's in
the driver's seat.

00:05:47,789 --> 00:05:48,824
Any witnesses?

00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:49,858
Nope.

00:05:49,925 --> 00:05:51,333
And no surveillance either.

00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:53,134
We ain't on the Strip, baby.

00:05:53,201 --> 00:05:54,636
500 bucks
and a Nevada license.

00:05:54,703 --> 00:05:56,338
Vincent DeCarlo, 28.

00:05:59,674 --> 00:06:01,209
It's an expensive-looking

00:06:01,276 --> 00:06:03,578
Italian suit
just to be a chauffeur.

00:06:07,415 --> 00:06:08,650
It's a wheelchair.

00:06:08,717 --> 00:06:10,118
Any indication he's handicapped?

00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:17,225
He's not wearing prosthetics
and his soles are worn.

00:06:17,292 --> 00:06:19,794
Somebody's missing their wheels.

00:06:19,861 --> 00:06:22,030
Gunshot wound
to the head.

00:06:22,097 --> 00:06:24,633
Looks like it came
through the windshield.

00:06:27,035 --> 00:06:29,871
Crater on the windshield
faces out.

00:06:29,938 --> 00:06:33,341
Which means that the shot came
from inside the van.

00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,378
( <i>gunshot</i> )

00:06:43,051 --> 00:06:45,120
So he's tapped out.

00:06:45,187 --> 00:06:46,655
Catherine asked
if I could lend a hand.

00:06:46,721 --> 00:06:47,689
Thanks.

00:06:52,427 --> 00:06:53,929
BROWN:
You see that blood spot
on the lapel?

00:06:53,995 --> 00:06:56,364
It's inconsistent
with the head wound.

00:06:56,431 --> 00:06:57,999
To avoid cross-contamination,

00:06:58,066 --> 00:06:59,734
you think you could cut
that out for me?

00:06:59,801 --> 00:07:00,735
Oh, sure.

00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,672
Possible GSR.

00:07:05,407 --> 00:07:10,178
Which means the shot
was fired from the wheelchair.

00:07:10,245 --> 00:07:11,580
How'd he shoot him
in the face?

00:07:11,646 --> 00:07:13,715
Hey, Vinnie.

00:07:13,782 --> 00:07:14,583
( <i>mimics gunshot</i> )

00:07:14,649 --> 00:07:15,851
( <i>gunshot</i> )

00:07:17,452 --> 00:07:18,920
So we got a guy
who fired a shot

00:07:18,987 --> 00:07:21,122
from a wheelchair
and then escaped on foot.

00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,360
VEGA:
<i>Social came back</i>

00:07:25,427 --> 00:07:28,196
on the dental work
of Veronica Juarez.

00:07:28,263 --> 00:07:30,732
No immediate family
in the States.

00:07:30,799 --> 00:07:32,367
Apartment's leased
in her name.

00:07:32,434 --> 00:07:33,535
Well, that's why

00:07:33,602 --> 00:07:36,438
bangers have girlfriends;
sign things they can't.

00:07:36,505 --> 00:07:38,106
This is a pretty nice place.

00:07:38,173 --> 00:07:40,108
A long way
from 28th
Street.

00:07:40,175 --> 00:07:41,843
Sure is.

00:07:46,214 --> 00:07:47,249
Catherine, Nick.

00:07:54,523 --> 00:07:56,825
Gangbanger girlfriend
with a degree?

00:07:56,892 --> 00:07:58,426
Sounds like a rock band.

00:08:18,513 --> 00:08:19,948
Hey, Vega?

00:08:20,982 --> 00:08:23,051
Check out these pics.

00:08:24,352 --> 00:08:26,321
Think she liked to party?

00:08:26,388 --> 00:08:28,523
That barely looks
like the same girl.

00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:29,591
I know.

00:08:29,658 --> 00:08:30,959
I'm going to
check out the kitchen.

00:08:31,026 --> 00:08:31,960
Okay.

00:08:32,027 --> 00:08:34,996
Well, there's no signs
of sexual activity.

00:08:40,302 --> 00:08:41,736
Oh, hang on now.

00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:49,110
That looks
like pure crystal meth.

00:08:49,177 --> 00:08:51,880
You could be up for a week
straight on that stuff
and not even know it.

00:08:51,947 --> 00:08:53,682
Perfect drug for this town.

00:08:56,751 --> 00:09:00,322
Hey, you think
that our vic was a groupie?

00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:06,862
Looks like a mariachi band
with artillery.

00:09:06,928 --> 00:09:07,929
I had a big dose of them

00:09:07,996 --> 00:09:09,531
when I worked
with a gang unit in LA.

00:09:09,598 --> 00:09:10,532
The band?

00:09:10,599 --> 00:09:11,666
The scumbags who listen
to that music.

00:09:11,733 --> 00:09:13,301
Sinaloa cowboys.

00:09:13,368 --> 00:09:14,369
Big drug producers.

00:09:14,436 --> 00:09:18,039
Okay. We've got a female victim
with a degree,

00:09:18,106 --> 00:09:23,278
Mexican artwork, drugs
and Sinaloan cowboys.

and killing cops.

00:12:35,071 --> 00:12:37,974
Why don't you buy a CD
on the way out.

00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:38,975
Yeah, I might do that.

00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:41,277
Hey, listen, one more thing,
if you could.

00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:43,913
This girl,
you know who she is?

00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,448
That's Carla.

00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:46,649
She's dead?

00:12:46,716 --> 00:12:47,650
Yeah.

00:12:47,717 --> 00:12:51,087
That's too bad.

00:12:51,153 --> 00:12:51,954
Yeah.

00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,357
She was a loyal fan.

00:12:54,423 --> 00:12:57,360
She knew the words
to every song we did.

00:12:59,629 --> 00:13:01,664
Anything else?

00:13:03,099 --> 00:13:05,301
Yeah.
Your name and number.

00:13:07,837 --> 00:13:10,039
( <i>knocking on door</i> ):
Hi.

00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:15,111
You got a minute?
Sure.

00:13:15,177 --> 00:13:18,681
We really haven't had a chance
to talk since the staff changes.

00:13:18,748 --> 00:13:22,351
I, uh...
I wanted to let you know

00:13:22,418 --> 00:13:24,387
that I said some things
to Ecklie

00:13:24,453 --> 00:13:27,123
that might have done the team
a disservice.

00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:29,392
Ecklie wanted to break
up the team, and he did.

00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:30,526
He asked me

00:13:30,593 --> 00:13:33,362
if you and I had had our
post-PEAP counseling session.

00:13:33,429 --> 00:13:34,497
And we didn't.

00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:37,166
Regardless, you should never
have to cover for your boss.

00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,467
I'm sorry.

00:13:38,534 --> 00:13:42,071
You've always been a little more
than a boss to me.

00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:45,308
Why do you think
I moved to Vegas?

00:13:48,945 --> 00:13:51,681
Look, I know our relationship
has been complicated.

00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:53,783
It's probably my fault.

00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:56,319
It's probably definitely
my fault.

00:13:56,385 --> 00:13:59,188
You completed
your counseling, right?

00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,556
Yeah. Yes.

00:14:00,623 --> 00:14:01,791
And...?

00:14:01,858 --> 00:14:05,862
Let's just say that...

00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,363
I sometimes...

00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:11,701
I look for validation
in inappropriate places.

00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:22,044
Look...

00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:25,681
Let's, um...

00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:30,720
It's okay.

00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:32,889
Okay.

00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,724
You know what,
we did our session.

00:14:36,592 --> 00:14:39,896
Don't forget to document
this for Ecklie.

00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:42,565
Right.

00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:44,433
Thanks.

00:14:54,343 --> 00:14:56,879
Bullet entered through
the left zygomatic arch,

00:14:56,946 --> 00:14:59,081
then penetrated the brain,

00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,117
then fragmented up.

00:15:01,184 --> 00:15:02,652
( <i>bullet drops onto tray</i> )

00:15:02,718 --> 00:15:04,687
The bullet never exited?

00:15:04,754 --> 00:15:05,955
Not even close.

00:15:06,022 --> 00:15:10,026
The right ear injury
is a separate wound

00:15:10,092 --> 00:15:13,262
unrelated to the entry
in the face.

00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,397
So he was shot twice.

00:15:14,463 --> 00:15:17,967
Yeah, can you identify
the weapon off these?

00:15:18,034 --> 00:15:20,069
It's highly unlikely.
The frags are too small.

00:15:20,136 --> 00:15:21,204
I'll go back to the scene,

00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:23,439
see if I can find
the AWOL bullet.

00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:25,741
All right.

00:15:25,808 --> 00:15:27,543
So I hear you found
a wheelchair.

00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:30,413
Yeah. No identifiable prints,
only smudges.

00:15:30,479 --> 00:15:31,881
Did you check the serial number?

00:15:31,948 --> 00:15:33,316
No.

00:15:33,382 --> 00:15:34,650
You know, wheelchairs
are registered

00:15:34,717 --> 00:15:35,918
with medical supply companies.

00:15:37,053 --> 00:15:40,289
It's not something
the average person would know.

00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,625
Thanks.
Good looking out.

00:15:45,294 --> 00:15:48,397
WOMAN:
Mrs. Bakerset's grandson bought
her a top-of-the-line chair

00:15:48,464 --> 00:15:50,499
about a year ago
after her stroke.

00:15:50,566 --> 00:15:52,101
We need to talk
to her.

00:15:52,168 --> 00:15:54,270
I'm sorry,
she passed away last week.

00:15:54,337 --> 00:15:56,138
Really?
That's strange.

00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:58,674
We found her wheelchair
at a crime scene downtown.

00:15:58,741 --> 00:16:00,209
Any idea how it got there?

00:16:00,276 --> 00:16:02,979
No, no, no, Bonnie hadn't left
hare in at least six months.

00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:04,647
Her place is right over here.

00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:06,115
When the residents pass,

00:16:06,182 --> 00:16:07,884
their property remains
in the room

00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:10,987
until their family picks it up.

00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,356
Her grandson said
he'd swing by next week.

00:16:13,422 --> 00:16:16,292
The woman loved to shop.

00:16:16,359 --> 00:16:19,595
I'll see if I can get you
some info on that wheelchair.

00:16:19,662 --> 00:16:21,497
Loved to shop?

00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:23,099
Looks more like
a compulsion.

00:16:23,165 --> 00:16:25,334
BRASS:
Fly fishing rods...

00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:30,640

vitamins, yoga tapes...

00:16:30,706 --> 00:16:32,275
cleaning products...

00:16:32,341 --> 00:16:35,811
Most of these boxes
have the same return address.

00:16:37,613 --> 00:16:38,648
It's local.

00:16:38,714 --> 00:16:40,216

00:16:51,661 --> 00:16:52,828

00:16:52,895 --> 00:16:54,363

And I'm Betsy Lewis.

00:16:58,201 --> 00:17:00,136
You shouldn't be in here.

00:17:00,203 --> 00:17:02,538
Well, Betsy,
I'm Detective Jim Brass,
Las Vegas police.

00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:04,407
And this is Warrick Brown
with the Crime Lab.

00:17:04,473 --> 00:17:05,508
Hi, folks.

00:17:05,575 --> 00:17:06,809
Could you all
tell me

00:17:06,876 --> 00:17:09,745
what's the deal
with all these boxes?

00:17:09,812 --> 00:17:12,415
Buying things made Bonnie happy.

00:17:12,481 --> 00:17:15,017
After her husband died,
she was lost.

00:17:15,084 --> 00:17:17,086
Then a nice salesman
kept calling.

00:17:17,153 --> 00:17:19,922
They would talk for hours.

00:17:19,989 --> 00:17:21,924
If you ask me,
she liked the attention.

00:17:21,991 --> 00:17:24,393
Ma'am, do you know
what happened to
Bonnie's wheelchair?

00:17:25,695 --> 00:17:27,597
It was a gift
from her grandson.

00:17:27,663 --> 00:17:30,533
Yeah. He's not a doctor,

00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,402
but he does all right
for himself.

00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:43,713
Off we go
into the wild, blue yonder.

00:17:46,382 --> 00:17:49,552
( <i>clears throat</i> )

00:17:49,619 --> 00:17:50,920
Why are you here?

00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:52,889
Grissom said it'd be okay
for me to come help.

00:17:52,955 --> 00:17:55,157
I need the experience.

00:17:55,224 --> 00:17:56,492
Well, if we can't find
the bullets,

00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:57,660
we find the shell casings.

00:17:57,727 --> 00:17:59,161
I'm thinking

00:17:59,228 --> 00:18:00,863
the shooter had the driver
at gunpoint,

00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:03,432
forced him to drive up to the
roof 'cause it was deserted.

00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:07,136
Give me your pen.

00:18:09,205 --> 00:18:11,807
You don't shoot a man
with the door open.

You got it?

00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:37,567
The shooter had to open
the door when he took off.

00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:42,338
Okay, stop.

00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:58,287
Nine-millimeter.

00:18:58,354 --> 00:19:00,957
Photograph it.

Oh, hey.

00:19:16,772 --> 00:19:18,441
What is this?

00:19:18,507 --> 00:19:21,077
Oh, it's, uh, it's an old case
from San Diego.

00:19:21,143 --> 00:19:22,111
"They were found

00:19:22,178 --> 00:19:24,313
"the next dawn,
in a dry river bed,

"their intestines exposed,
and many cats

00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:31,687
Yeah, now you put that to music,
sing it in Spanish,

00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:33,523
and you have a <i>narcocorrido.</i>

00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,391
Narco what?

00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,393
A <i>corrido</i> is a Mexican ballad.

00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,561
A <i>narcocorrido...</i>

00:19:38,628 --> 00:19:40,029
A drug ballad.

00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:41,297
Kind of more or less,

00:19:41,364 --> 00:19:44,033
except their songs include
actual events,

00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,403
like specific
dates, names...

00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:49,105
Here.

00:19:49,171 --> 00:19:50,940
Come over here,
check this out.

00:19:59,682 --> 00:20:02,685
This girl was shacked up
with a local drug lord.

00:20:02,752 --> 00:20:04,153
He dumps her,
she rats him out

00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,188
to the authorities.

00:20:05,254 --> 00:20:06,255
The rest of the body

00:20:06,322 --> 00:20:07,390
was never found.

00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,926
But the song was a big hit.

00:20:09,992 --> 00:20:12,662
So apart from having
her hair removed,

00:20:12,728 --> 00:20:16,699
Veronica Juarez's murder
was life imitating art.

00:20:16,766 --> 00:20:18,000
Yeah, and if that's the case,

00:20:18,067 --> 00:20:22,171
anyone who knows this song
could... could be the killer.

00:20:22,238 --> 00:20:24,307
We don't even know that
much about the victim,

00:20:24,373 --> 00:20:26,008
other than she was
somewhere between

00:20:26,075 --> 00:20:28,344
art lover and meth user.

00:20:39,322 --> 00:20:40,489
Something I said?

00:20:40,556 --> 00:20:41,257
Huh?

00:20:41,324 --> 00:20:42,925
Oh, no, no, no.
Sorry.

00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:46,395

something I saw.

MAN:
Veronica had been here
since last summer.

00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:54,003
Maybe six months.

00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:55,972
We ran Ms. Juarez's
social.

00:20:56,038 --> 00:20:57,340
She wasn't an employee.

00:20:57,406 --> 00:20:58,774
She was more
of a freelancer.

00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:01,677
The <i>narcocorridos</i> piece
was her first major story.

00:21:01,744 --> 00:21:04,046
Makes me sick to think
she's not going to finish it.

00:21:04,113 --> 00:21:05,781
She was working
undercover?

00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:07,884
She figured it was the only way
to get these guys

00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,151
to open up to her.

00:21:09,218 --> 00:21:10,586
She was right.

00:21:10,653 --> 00:21:13,189
Yeah, her article
came down pretty hard
on the music, huh?

<i>Narcocorridos</i> glamorize

00:21:16,726 --> 00:21:18,094

Elindio Zapata.

00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:17,914
Elindio Zapata.

Oh, <i>de veras?</i>

00:23:22,451 --> 00:23:23,519
Well, that's funny,

00:23:23,586 --> 00:23:25,087
because the Border Patrol
said you spoke

00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:26,789
perfect English.

00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,562
We're going to take
a look around, <i>coyote.</i>

00:23:34,697 --> 00:23:37,200
You break it,

00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,648
What do you got?

00:24:25,715 --> 00:24:28,651
Veronica Juarez had a jacket
just like this one.

00:24:28,718 --> 00:24:29,952
Minus the tire tracks.

00:24:32,154 --> 00:24:34,524
This jacket?

00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:36,092
It's coming with me.

00:24:36,158 --> 00:24:37,827
And you're going
with him.

( <i>handcuffs clicking</i> )

00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,302
We know that you went
to the newspaper office

00:24:43,369 --> 00:24:44,336
and you threatened her.

00:24:44,403 --> 00:24:46,338
<i>Si, señor.</i>

00:24:46,405 --> 00:24:49,175
I went to the <i>oficina.</i>

00:24:49,241 --> 00:24:52,178
Her mentals
were going places

00:24:52,244 --> 00:24:54,380
they need not.
You want to tell me

00:24:54,447 --> 00:24:56,082
what this is?

00:24:57,883 --> 00:24:59,785
ELINDIO:

00:25:02,421 --> 00:25:05,091
My right in America.

00:25:05,157 --> 00:25:07,493
I don't know, it looks more like
a human finger to me.

00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:10,496
It's been burned.

00:25:10,563 --> 00:25:13,199
Eyes can fool you.

00:25:13,265 --> 00:25:16,469
That's right.
That's why I do a lot of tests.

00:25:16,535 --> 00:25:18,571
And I'm also gonna match
the blood found

00:25:18,637 --> 00:25:20,372
on Veronica's jacket right here.

00:25:21,741 --> 00:25:24,343
ELINDIO:
I know nothing about this.

00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:28,447
Nice... <i>muchacho</i> gave it to me.

00:25:28,514 --> 00:25:29,315
<i>¿Como se llama?</i>

00:25:29,381 --> 00:25:32,318
Don't know name, only...

00:25:32,385 --> 00:25:35,087

00:25:35,154 --> 00:25:37,390
<i>Cara.</i>

00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:43,996
Mm, people give me things
all the time.

00:25:44,063 --> 00:25:45,698
Now, why would they do that?

00:25:45,765 --> 00:25:48,167
Maybe they like me.

00:25:48,234 --> 00:25:49,368
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:25:49,435 --> 00:25:52,505
Or for <i>proteccion.</i>

00:25:53,739 --> 00:25:55,841
When you look at me,

00:25:55,908 --> 00:25:59,879
you see <i>un hombre pobre, sucio.</i>

00:25:59,945 --> 00:26:02,381
Poor, dirty man.

00:26:02,448 --> 00:26:04,350
<i>Pero soy mas.</i>

00:26:04,417 --> 00:26:06,419
I am much more.

00:26:07,853 --> 00:26:10,756
I am descendent...

00:26:10,823 --> 00:26:12,725
of Jesus Malverde.

00:26:12,792 --> 00:26:14,326
God...

00:26:14,393 --> 00:26:16,862
<i>Dios.</i>

00:26:16,929 --> 00:26:19,165
Angel of the poor.

00:26:19,231 --> 00:26:20,599
The Mexican Robin Hood,

00:26:20,666 --> 00:26:22,101
a thief and a killer,

00:26:22,168 --> 00:26:24,070
hung May 3, 1909.

00:26:24,136 --> 00:26:27,006
He is the reason...

00:26:27,073 --> 00:26:29,041
you cannot touch me.

00:26:30,476 --> 00:26:34,213
<i>No me puedes tocar.</i>

00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,148
You're a disgrace
to our community.

00:26:36,215 --> 00:26:37,717
You're a greedy fence

00:26:37,783 --> 00:26:40,352
who will do or say anything
to make a buck.

00:26:40,419 --> 00:26:42,288
<i>No, señor.</i>

00:26:42,354 --> 00:26:43,889
No, I may warn,

00:26:43,956 --> 00:26:45,691
I may protect,

00:26:45,758 --> 00:26:49,628
I may harm,
I may do many things.

00:26:49,695 --> 00:26:51,597
But not for money.

00:26:51,664 --> 00:26:53,766
Okay, hold out

00:26:53,833 --> 00:26:55,735

we're gonna get some prints.

00:27:23,996 --> 00:27:26,499
You got lucky with
the blood-stained lapel.

00:27:26,565 --> 00:27:29,435
I didn't match the vic,
but I got a hit in CODIS.

00:27:29,502 --> 00:27:31,904
Great.

Congratulations, Jim Brass.

00:27:49,388 --> 00:27:52,124
You're guaranteed one of these

00:27:53,592 --> 00:27:55,961
a brand-new Caddy,

water purification system.

00:27:59,365 --> 00:28:00,866
You finally did it, Jim.

00:28:00,933 --> 00:28:04,236
Just send NZA a check for $300
and claim your prize.

00:28:04,303 --> 00:28:07,206
NZA. So, where'd you get
the sales pitch, man?

00:28:07,273 --> 00:28:09,508
From the victim's
personal effects.

00:28:09,575 --> 00:28:13,279
My guess, it's the same boob
who was calling Bonnie.

00:28:13,345 --> 00:28:17,049
The company's address
was on the old lady's boxes.

00:28:20,052 --> 00:28:22,321
( <i>all talking</i> )
Mrs. Mason, I am standing,
which means what?

00:28:22,388 --> 00:28:23,756
You should be sitting.
That's right, because

00:28:23,823 --> 00:28:25,391
I've got some great news.
You just won a Cadillac.

00:28:25,458 --> 00:28:27,626
Well, does your
husband drive?

00:28:27,693 --> 00:28:29,962
Have you ever shopped
on 5th Avenue?

00:28:30,029 --> 00:28:33,332
Come on. Look, I've been waiting
my whole life to make this call.

00:28:33,399 --> 00:28:35,067
Yes. Yes.
Well, as soon as we get that...

00:28:35,134 --> 00:28:37,503
Come on, people!
Let's close these deals!

00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:39,872
I got a room full
of pikers or closers?

00:28:39,939 --> 00:28:43,976
My grandmother used
to say if it sounds too
good to be true, it is.

00:28:44,043 --> 00:28:45,845
Only closers go on that board.

00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,048
Can I help you gentlemen?

00:28:49,115 --> 00:28:50,750
I'm Detective Jim Brass,
Las Vegas Police,

00:28:52,251 --> 00:28:53,919
from the Crime Lab--
we got a couple
of questions.

00:28:53,986 --> 00:28:56,155
We know Vincent DeCarlo's

00:28:56,222 --> 00:28:57,723
how about Dax Blanchard?

BLANCHARD:
You were?

00:29:02,828 --> 00:29:04,063
You know what I want you
to do, Harry?

00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:05,664
I want you to stand up,
and I want you

00:29:05,731 --> 00:29:07,433
to march over
to that checkbook, soldier.

00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,602
It does not sound like
you're standing up to me, Harry.

00:29:09,668 --> 00:29:10,836
You know why
we're doing this, Harry?

00:29:10,903 --> 00:29:12,571
Because we have something
called trust, you and me.

00:29:12,638 --> 00:29:13,506
You trust...

00:29:15,107 --> 00:29:18,043
Harry, I need you to do me
a favor, though, okay?

00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:21,380
I need you to hang on for me
for one second, okay?

00:29:21,447 --> 00:29:23,749
Okay. You're the greatest.

00:29:23,816 --> 00:29:25,551
BRASS:
Dax, at yakety-yak,

00:29:25,618 --> 00:29:26,752
you're the greatest.

00:29:26,819 --> 00:29:28,487
I got a one-time-only offer
for you.

00:29:28,554 --> 00:29:30,523
Should we talk about it here
or downtown?

00:29:30,589 --> 00:29:32,358
Come on, what is this?
This is a legal room.

00:29:32,425 --> 00:29:34,527
What the hell is that?

00:29:35,594 --> 00:29:36,662
Are you packing?

00:29:39,098 --> 00:29:40,966
This a legal gun?

00:29:41,033 --> 00:29:42,868
Yeah, it is. Registered to me.

00:29:42,935 --> 00:29:45,871
BRASS:
Okay. Downtown it is.

00:29:45,938 --> 00:29:46,639
Let's go.

00:29:49,008 --> 00:29:51,644
Nine-millimeter.

00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:54,413
Same as the casings
found on the scene.

00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,282
Nothing I'm doing
is illegal.

00:29:56,348 --> 00:29:59,285
In exchange for a small fee,
my customers get

00:29:59,351 --> 00:30:02,088
one of five
specified prizes.

00:30:02,154 --> 00:30:04,790
When was the last time
someone won a Cadillac?

00:30:04,857 --> 00:30:07,059
While ago.

00:30:07,126 --> 00:30:09,628
Long time ago.

00:30:09,695 --> 00:30:11,063
Never, all right?

00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:13,999
Look, I'm only obligated
to give one of the prizes.

00:30:14,066 --> 00:30:16,068
Nothing says it can't be
the cheap one.

00:30:16,135 --> 00:30:18,037
Apparently, you're very
good at your job,

00:30:18,104 --> 00:30:19,238
but you're not the best.

00:30:19,305 --> 00:30:21,040
I saw the board--
you're number two.

00:30:21,107 --> 00:30:22,308
Right behind a dead guy.

When was the last
time you saw him?

00:30:26,078 --> 00:30:28,314
Yesterday morning.

maybe I missed.

You sold my grandmother,
you son of a bitch.

00:30:46,365 --> 00:30:47,833
Took every last cent.

00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:50,403

He was constantly stealing
my leads, stealing my customers.

00:31:04,116 --> 00:31:06,986
Then I find out he rips off
my grandmother?

So you killed Vincent DeCarlo
because he was better than you,

00:31:14,427 --> 00:31:16,862
because he stole your leads,
because he sold

00:31:16,929 --> 00:31:19,298

wanted him out of the way.

00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:25,424
I was seeing Carla...

00:33:25,491 --> 00:33:29,061
until Veronica Juarez's
article came out.

00:33:29,128 --> 00:33:32,364
I figured out who she was.

00:33:32,431 --> 00:33:33,966
And then?

00:33:34,033 --> 00:33:36,102
Then I dumped her ass.

00:33:36,168 --> 00:33:37,636
What do <i>you</i> think?

00:33:37,703 --> 00:33:39,638
She put down my music,

00:33:39,705 --> 00:33:41,907
my band, made it look
like everyone involved

00:33:41,974 --> 00:33:44,577
in <i>narcocorridos</i> was a
drug dealer or a criminal.

00:33:46,445 --> 00:33:47,947
She lied to me.

00:33:48,013 --> 00:33:49,548
<i>¿Asi es como pagas?</i>

00:33:49,615 --> 00:33:53,319
( <i>shouting in Spanish</i> )

00:33:53,386 --> 00:33:55,554
<i>Narcocorridos</i>
are entertainment.

00:33:55,621 --> 00:33:57,556
The drugs,

00:33:57,623 --> 00:33:59,125
they're an economic activity

00:33:59,191 --> 00:34:02,027
woven in the fabric
of Sinaloan history.

00:34:02,094 --> 00:34:04,830
The music does nothing
more than reflect that.

00:34:04,897 --> 00:34:08,067
<i>Narcocorridos</i>
also depicts actual events.

00:34:08,134 --> 00:34:09,668
So does the 6:00 news.

00:34:09,735 --> 00:34:11,637
A lot of people
were pissed off

00:34:11,704 --> 00:34:13,639
when she wrote that trash.
So you're saying

00:34:13,706 --> 00:34:15,207
that she deserved to die?

00:34:15,274 --> 00:34:16,809
I'm saying she was
a two-faced bitch

00:34:16,876 --> 00:34:18,344
who got off on
our music at night,

00:34:18,411 --> 00:34:20,679
wrote about how
disgusting we were
during the day,

00:34:20,746 --> 00:34:22,882
when she was the one
smoking and snorting,

00:34:22,948 --> 00:34:24,717
screwing everything
she could find.

00:34:24,784 --> 00:34:26,018
We tested her blood.

00:34:26,085 --> 00:34:28,821
We know that Miss Juarez
didn't do drugs.

00:34:28,888 --> 00:34:32,725
And... I seriously doubt that
she was having sex with you.

00:34:32,792 --> 00:34:35,561
Listen...

00:34:35,628 --> 00:34:37,363
I didn't kill Veronica.

00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:38,864
But she was a <i>pocha,</i>

00:34:38,931 --> 00:34:40,699
a traitor, and
people like that

00:34:40,766 --> 00:34:42,701
aren't taken lightly
in Sinaloa.

00:34:42,768 --> 00:34:45,371
We're not in Sinaloa.

00:34:45,438 --> 00:34:47,440
When you're inside
La Hacienda Corona,

00:34:47,506 --> 00:34:48,908
you might as well be.

00:35:10,834 --> 00:35:13,604
<i>Deutschland uber alles...</i>

00:35:16,583 --> 00:35:18,685
I identified the casings
recovered at the scene.

00:35:18,752 --> 00:35:20,487
They don't match
Dax Blanchard's 9-mil.

00:35:20,554 --> 00:35:22,089
So, did he have
any other firearms?

00:35:22,155 --> 00:35:23,423
Nothing registered.

00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:27,561
Well, head stamp on the casings
was a little unusual.

00:35:28,795 --> 00:35:30,998
"DWM?"

00:35:31,064 --> 00:35:33,734
<i>Deutsche Waffen</i>
<i>und Munitions fabrik.</i>

00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,069
Well, that's
World War II-era German.

00:35:36,136 --> 00:35:37,971
Well, it's one thing
to collect old guns;

00:35:38,038 --> 00:35:39,673
old ammunition comes from
a trophy--

00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:41,575
an enemy gun a
soldier brings back

00:35:41,642 --> 00:35:42,876
from battle.

00:35:42,943 --> 00:35:45,312
So, our shooter's
an old soldier.

00:35:46,913 --> 00:35:48,448
Hmm.

00:35:48,515 --> 00:35:51,184
STUART MANSLOW:
<i>Bonnie had Alzheimer's,</i>
<i>you know.</i>

00:35:51,251 --> 00:35:56,256
And that son of a monster
sold her twice a day.

00:35:56,323 --> 00:35:58,759
Once in the morning,

00:35:58,825 --> 00:36:01,094
and again that night,

00:36:01,161 --> 00:36:03,463
because...

00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:07,267
he knew she had forgot
that she bought the first time.

00:36:07,334 --> 00:36:10,604
I tried to talk her out of it,

00:36:10,671 --> 00:36:13,807
but Vincent
just kept on calling.

00:36:13,874 --> 00:36:16,977
And Bonnie just
kept on a-buying.

00:36:17,044 --> 00:36:18,845
So, what did you do
about it, sir?

00:36:18,912 --> 00:36:20,013
Huh?

00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,148
What'd you do about it?

00:36:24,151 --> 00:36:28,875
Vincent started calling
all of us.

00:36:28,942 --> 00:36:32,178
I played along.

00:36:32,245 --> 00:36:34,414
I told him I didn't have
a checking account,

00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,849
so the bastard offered
to drive me to the bank.

00:36:36,916 --> 00:36:40,887
I wanted him to think
that I was weak.

00:36:40,954 --> 00:36:45,258
So I borrowed
Bonnie's wheelchair.

00:36:45,325 --> 00:36:46,993
Drove me to the bank.

00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:49,662
Pushed me right up
to the teller.

00:36:49,729 --> 00:36:51,831
Oh, he was helpful.

00:36:51,898 --> 00:36:53,600
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:36:53,666 --> 00:36:56,736
And then he drove me back
to the casino.

00:36:56,803 --> 00:36:58,605
Why did you have him park
on the roof?

00:37:00,006 --> 00:37:02,709
Why not?

00:37:02,775 --> 00:37:05,011
Nobody parks on the roof.

00:37:05,078 --> 00:37:06,245
Here we go.

00:37:06,312 --> 00:37:07,458
Now all we need
is the money.

00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:11,595

<i>But I got him good</i>
<i>the second one.</i>

00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:20,096
Been a long time
since I had to kill someone.

00:37:20,162 --> 00:37:22,798
Where's your sidearm, sir?

00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:30,639
( <i>clattering</i> )

00:37:35,144 --> 00:37:37,213

When I was serving
my country,

00:37:40,282 --> 00:37:43,819
I knew who my enemy was.

00:37:47,623 --> 00:37:49,625
The gun, please, sir.

00:37:49,692 --> 00:37:52,528
Now the enemy is...

00:37:52,595 --> 00:37:56,565
some punk... calls you up
on the telephone...

00:37:56,632 --> 00:37:58,234

00:38:01,871 --> 00:38:03,339
