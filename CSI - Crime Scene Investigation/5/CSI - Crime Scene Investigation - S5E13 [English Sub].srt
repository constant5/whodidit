00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:38,178
( <i>yelling</i> ):
Joe! Joe!

00:00:44,709 --> 00:00:47,779
I'm not your damn secretary
and your wife's not my boss!

00:00:47,846 --> 00:00:49,147
You hear that, Cheryl?

00:00:49,214 --> 00:00:51,483
This is a company phone.

00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:01,526
If this is
an Indian burial ground,

00:01:01,593 --> 00:01:02,861
I'm totally screwed.

00:01:02,927 --> 00:01:05,030
I'll be in litigation
for months.

00:01:05,096 --> 00:01:06,698
I can't make
any promises, sir,

00:01:06,765 --> 00:01:09,434
but I don't think
the Paiute wore heels.

00:01:11,102 --> 00:01:12,737
Hey! What's it look like?

00:01:12,804 --> 00:01:15,240
Well...

00:01:15,307 --> 00:01:17,942
The body's been
encased in something.

00:01:18,009 --> 00:01:20,045
It's black.
It's flexible...

00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,648
But it's pretty stubborn.

00:01:23,715 --> 00:01:24,783
I think it's roofing tar.

00:01:24,849 --> 00:01:27,485
It keeps the smell
and the animals away.

00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:29,821
It makes our job a lot harder.

00:01:29,888 --> 00:01:33,458
We've got disturbed soil
in a three-by-five perimeter.

00:01:33,525 --> 00:01:36,061
Okay.

00:01:36,127 --> 00:01:37,562
Gentlemen!

00:01:37,629 --> 00:01:39,931
Start your shovels!

00:02:00,151 --> 00:02:02,354
Do you think our Jane Doe
was buried alive?

00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:05,790
Whoever buried her sure had
access to a lot of tar.

00:02:05,857 --> 00:02:11,162
Maybe
a construction worker.

00:02:11,229 --> 00:02:13,565
Nick, did you get
that last soil sample?

00:02:13,631 --> 00:02:17,636
Yeah, but I think I got
something else, too.

00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,039
Hey, guys.

00:02:21,106 --> 00:02:22,641

00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:26,911
Ugh...

00:02:26,978 --> 00:02:29,581
Means there's
another body.

00:02:34,653 --> 00:02:37,188
I don't know if she
was buried alive, but...

00:02:37,255 --> 00:02:39,257

Two sets of feet.

Two skulls, two bodies.

00:03:43,162 --> 00:03:45,500
Both appear to be female.

00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,435
Jane Doe Bottom's curled up.

00:03:47,502 --> 00:03:49,370
Jane Doe Top's laid out flat.

WILLOWS:
This looks like... barbed wire.

00:03:52,907 --> 00:03:53,841
It's in her mouth.

00:03:53,908 --> 00:03:55,243
Could be a dental appliance.

00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:57,979
Or maybe some kind
of torture device.

00:03:58,046 --> 00:03:59,447
You're thinking
ritualistic?

00:03:59,514 --> 00:04:00,948
I don't know
what I'm thinking.

00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,418
Hey.

00:04:03,485 --> 00:04:06,388
They told me you dug up
two bodies covered in tar?

00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:10,469
So. How you going
to separate them?

00:04:10,536 --> 00:04:12,805
I'm not sure yet.

00:04:12,871 --> 00:04:14,640
Obviously I can't
saw through

00:04:14,707 --> 00:04:17,609
without potentially
destroying evidence, so...

00:04:17,676 --> 00:04:20,312
If the tar were harder,
I could chisel it.

00:04:20,379 --> 00:04:22,114
If it were softer, we could

00:04:22,181 --> 00:04:24,616
peel it off.

00:04:24,683 --> 00:04:26,352
I have an idea.

00:04:26,418 --> 00:04:27,720
Of course you do,

00:04:27,786 --> 00:04:30,956
but last I checked,
the backlog on grave

00:04:31,023 --> 00:04:33,492
was about... mmm...
a hundred cases?

00:04:33,559 --> 00:04:36,500
You've been spending
too much time with Ecklie.

00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,103
I'm off the clock.

00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:40,705
I came in early for this.

00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,115
You ever done
this before?

00:04:51,182 --> 00:04:52,984
Nope...

00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:54,986
but I do know that tar

00:04:55,052 --> 00:04:59,991
becomes as brittle as glass
at about minus 200 degrees.

00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:33,824
Okay, Mr. Wizard.

00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:55,413
Not much left of her
but the clothes.

00:05:55,479 --> 00:05:58,316
Well, let's see what our
other one looks like, shall we?

00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,008
Huh.

00:06:24,075 --> 00:06:26,010
( <i>clearing throat</i> )

00:06:26,077 --> 00:06:27,211
Oh, boy.

00:06:27,278 --> 00:06:29,413
I gotta get my
shift started.

00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,615
Good luck
with the case.

00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:31,949
No, no, no.

00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:35,386
You're not going to just
destroy this skull and split.

00:06:35,453 --> 00:06:37,622
You can make a nice mold
from the impression.

00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:39,490
I'm short-handed as it is.

00:06:39,557 --> 00:06:41,158
I think Sara
just wrapped a case.

00:06:41,225 --> 00:06:42,226
If you need her,

00:06:42,293 --> 00:06:43,894
she's yours.

00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:54,438
Wow.

00:06:54,505 --> 00:06:56,274
Look at you,
Mr. Straightedge.

00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:59,043
I did not know that your
hair could do that.

00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,278
I look like a dork.

00:07:00,344 --> 00:07:01,212
No, no.

00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:02,513
No, you look like a pro,

00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,714

Nice job.

00:09:57,108 --> 00:09:58,443
Thanks.

00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:03,868
Thank you, Sara.

00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:08,611
Well, Doc Robbins
told me that she had

00:10:08,678 --> 00:10:11,481
severe trauma to the skull,
probably what killed her.

00:10:11,547 --> 00:10:14,450
Well, that would explain the
blood David found on her shirt.

00:10:14,517 --> 00:10:16,018
Mia's running DNA

00:10:16,085 --> 00:10:18,788
right now to find out
if it matches the victim,

00:10:18,855 --> 00:10:20,723
or any suspects,
for that matter.

00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,558
Remember, now, she
had a broken jaw.

00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:23,559
That was 26-gauge

00:10:23,626 --> 00:10:25,128
stainless steel.

00:10:25,194 --> 00:10:27,930
It's used to surgically
wire jawbones shut.

00:10:29,499 --> 00:10:31,367
What's with the fingers?

00:10:31,434 --> 00:10:33,169
Distal phalanges were cut off.

00:10:33,236 --> 00:10:35,238
Both vics,
both hands.

00:10:35,304 --> 00:10:37,940
I cast tool marks, Looks like
some kind of opposed blade tool.

00:10:38,007 --> 00:10:39,642
Jagged on one side,
smooth on the other.

00:10:39,709 --> 00:10:41,444
NICK:
Well, if it
was pre-mortem,

00:10:41,511 --> 00:10:43,012
that would support torture.

00:10:43,079 --> 00:10:44,680
Yeah, but if it was post,

00:10:44,747 --> 00:10:47,450
they probably did it
to conceal identity.

00:10:47,517 --> 00:10:48,751
Hey, you guys
still working

00:10:48,818 --> 00:10:50,052

grave theory?

00:10:50,119 --> 00:10:51,521
Yeah.

00:10:51,587 --> 00:10:54,223
You know what I like
about flesh decomposing in soil?

00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:55,291
It's predictable.

00:11:02,098 --> 00:11:05,134
The longer they're there,
the lower the concentrations.

00:11:05,201 --> 00:11:08,204
I tested the soil samples Nick
took from around each body.

00:11:08,271 --> 00:11:10,873
Curly Sue was on the bottom
for at least five years,

00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,875
and Flat Sally was
on top for only two.

00:11:12,942 --> 00:11:13,976
So we've got

00:11:14,043 --> 00:11:15,878
a killer who digs a grave,

00:11:15,945 --> 00:11:17,480
dumps a body,
covers it with tar,

00:11:17,547 --> 00:11:19,482
comes back three years
later, digs again

00:11:19,549 --> 00:11:22,185
and dumps another
one on top of it?

00:11:22,251 --> 00:11:24,887
Ten to one, it's
domestic abuse.

00:11:24,954 --> 00:11:27,123

We don't get as many

Yeah.

00:14:01,377 --> 00:14:03,179
How did the two of you meet?

00:14:03,246 --> 00:14:04,046
Through an agency.

00:14:04,113 --> 00:14:05,815
Svetlana was a mail-order bride?

00:14:05,882 --> 00:14:08,985
We were introduced
through an agency.

00:14:09,051 --> 00:14:11,287
So what happened,
the Russian agency

00:14:11,354 --> 00:14:13,055
denied your application

00:14:13,122 --> 00:14:15,424
for another wife,
or, uh, you lost your taste

00:14:15,491 --> 00:14:16,592
for white meat?

00:14:16,659 --> 00:14:18,261
Too tough?
You know what, lady?

00:14:18,327 --> 00:14:22,265
I am not gonna feel bad
about my decision.

00:14:22,331 --> 00:14:25,234
I dated American women,
like you.

00:14:25,301 --> 00:14:27,036
They don't want to be
anyone's wife,

00:14:27,103 --> 00:14:29,272
or mother-- you mention
the word "domestic,"

00:14:29,338 --> 00:14:31,073
they're done with you.

00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:34,243
It's nice to be needed...

00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:35,912
not resented.

00:14:35,978 --> 00:14:39,348
Yeah, I find isolation
and dependency really sexy, too.

00:14:39,415 --> 00:14:41,350
You know, what,
you can think
whatever you want.

00:14:51,861 --> 00:14:53,396
SIDLE:
Look, all I am
asking is to have

00:14:53,463 --> 00:14:55,364
a black-and-white do
regular welfare checks.

00:14:55,431 --> 00:14:56,632
Did the wife ask
for help?

00:14:56,699 --> 00:14:58,100
Well, that's kind
of hard to do when

00:14:58,167 --> 00:15:00,103
you don't speak English
and you're a sex slave.

00:15:00,169 --> 00:15:02,004
I'm sure she doesn't
know her rights.

00:15:02,071 --> 00:15:05,007
( <i>sighs</i> ):
You can't arrest someone
for marrying the wrong person.

00:15:05,074 --> 00:15:07,176
You would know.

00:15:07,917 --> 00:15:10,319
If the guy's an abuser,
if he killed his first wife,

00:15:10,386 --> 00:15:12,355
we will build a case
and we will nail him.

00:15:12,421 --> 00:15:14,123
And in the meantime,
he can just keep

00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:15,458
using her as
a punching bag.

00:15:15,525 --> 00:15:17,493
Sara, I was there--
there wasn't a mark on her.

00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,696
Not that we could
see, Catherine.

00:15:20,763 --> 00:15:23,866
You know... every time
we get a case with a hint

00:15:23,933 --> 00:15:26,803
of domestic violence or abuse,
you go off the deep end.

00:15:26,869 --> 00:15:28,905
What is your problem?
Yeah, I probably do,

00:15:28,971 --> 00:15:31,707
and <i>you</i> let your sexuality
cloud your judgment about men,

00:15:31,774 --> 00:15:33,041
and I'm gonna go over your head.

00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:34,075
Sidle.

00:15:35,677 --> 00:15:37,178
Get in my office. Now.

00:15:39,917 --> 00:15:41,875
You are
a law enforcement officer

00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,477
and a representative
of this city.

00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:45,645
That means I expect you
to conduct yourself

00:15:45,712 --> 00:15:48,448
in an appropriate manner,
in and away from this lab.

00:15:48,515 --> 00:15:50,183
You know what,
if this is gonna be

00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,119
one of your "for the good
of the lab" speeches,

00:15:52,185 --> 00:15:53,453
don't bother, I've heard them.

00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,623
Just take a seat.

00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:57,824
Willows is a supervisor--

00:15:57,891 --> 00:15:59,593
that means you treat
her with respect.

00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:01,795
Insulting her in
front of coworkers...

00:16:01,862 --> 00:16:03,363
She's not my supervisor.

00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,599
All right-- your superior.

00:16:05,665 --> 00:16:08,034
Sara, you
berate witnesses,

00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:10,170
you disrespect
the people you work with,

00:16:10,237 --> 00:16:12,205
you luck your way out of a DUI.

00:16:12,272 --> 00:16:14,641
Take a look-- you got a half a
dozen complaints in your jacket.

00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:16,243
And if Grissom
really documented

00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:18,145
your performance,
there'd probably be

00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:20,680
a dozen more-- that's not the
kind of person I want in my lab.

00:16:20,747 --> 00:16:22,516
The only reason this is your lab

00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:24,551
is because Grissom
doesn't kiss ass.

00:16:24,618 --> 00:16:25,886
You couldn't hack it
in the field,

00:16:25,952 --> 00:16:27,020
so you fail your way up,

00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:28,255
you break up our team,

00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:30,123
and now you just hang out
in the hallways

00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,725
waiting for one of us
to screw up.

00:16:31,792 --> 00:16:33,827
Sidle, you're
on one-week suspension

00:16:33,894 --> 00:16:35,529
without pay, and
when you get back,
Great.

00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:37,397
you're apologizing to Catherine.

00:16:37,464 --> 00:16:39,966
No, I'm not.

00:16:44,971 --> 00:16:47,674
What's going on
around here?
( <i>groans</i> )

00:16:47,741 --> 00:16:49,509
I don't want
to talk about it.

00:16:49,576 --> 00:16:51,178
Okay, so, this
is the jacket

00:16:51,244 --> 00:16:52,479
that Svetlana was wearing

00:16:52,546 --> 00:16:54,181
the night that she went
into the hospital?

00:16:54,247 --> 00:16:55,982
Yeah. I pulled it
out of the vault

00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:58,418
from the original abuse charge
two years ago.

00:16:58,485 --> 00:17:00,253
Most of the blood is Svetlana's,

00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,721
although there is
a small portion

00:17:01,788 --> 00:17:03,256
that comes from an unknown male.

00:17:03,323 --> 00:17:04,758
So I'll see if the
husband's willing

00:17:04,825 --> 00:17:06,193
to give us a comparison.

00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:08,595
Don't bother, he already
voluntarily gave a sample

00:17:08,662 --> 00:17:11,098
the night that this happened,
and it's not a match.

00:17:11,164 --> 00:17:12,766
So he was telling
the truth?

00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:14,201
Eh...

00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:18,738
I did find this...
in her pocket.

00:17:18,805 --> 00:17:20,807
Is that the husband?

00:17:22,576 --> 00:17:23,977
Nyet.

00:17:25,812 --> 00:17:28,281
BROWN:
Well, they're looking
pretty friendly here.

00:17:28,348 --> 00:17:30,283
And you could write
some teen poetry

00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:33,453
from the words that are
highlighted in this dictionary.

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,156
Well, maybe Andrew
found out that Svetlana

00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:39,292
wasn't as lonely as
he thought she was.

00:17:42,963 --> 00:17:46,299
Catherine, I heard
Ecklie suspended Sara.

00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:48,468
What can we do?
Nothing.

00:17:48,535 --> 00:17:49,936
No?
Mm-mm.

00:17:50,003 --> 00:17:52,239
Sara's always been there
for anyone who needs <i>her.</i>

00:17:52,305 --> 00:17:53,573
She's always had <i>my</i> back.

00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,408
So what if she flew off
the handle a little?

00:17:55,475 --> 00:17:57,244
Greg, she crossed the line
with a suspect;

00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,246
she was inappropriate with me
and with Ecklie;

00:17:59,312 --> 00:18:01,314
she needs the time off.

00:18:03,683 --> 00:18:05,652
BROWN:
A lot of blood
on that blouse.

00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:07,954
Yeah, well, her wounds
don't just trickle,

00:18:08,021 --> 00:18:09,122
man, they-they gush.

00:18:09,189 --> 00:18:12,125
Were you able to get
anything off these jeans?

00:18:12,192 --> 00:18:14,394
Uh, found this paper.

00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:15,862
It was found in the pocket.

00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:17,297
Decomp trashed it, though.

00:18:17,364 --> 00:18:19,666
That reminds me of the time
I as at the Ghost Bar,

00:18:19,733 --> 00:18:21,101
and I ran into this hottie.

00:18:21,168 --> 00:18:23,170
I mean, the girls was
an absolute dime.

00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:24,771
And I didn't have
my phone on me,

00:18:24,838 --> 00:18:26,573
so I wrote her number down
on paper,

00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,208
and put it in my pants.

00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:30,410
The jeans ended up
in the wash.

00:18:30,477 --> 00:18:31,645
Ouch.
Yeah.

00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:33,346
But...

00:18:36,149 --> 00:18:37,517
Yeah.

00:18:37,584 --> 00:18:40,153
STOKES ( <i>chuckles</i> ):
Whoa...

00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,688
Fatty acids dissolve the ink,

00:18:41,755 --> 00:18:43,690
and it leeches
onto the pocket lining.

00:18:43,757 --> 00:18:45,692
Yeah.
Huh.

00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:48,595
That must've been a pretty hot
number you had there, boss.

00:18:48,662 --> 00:18:50,130
Yeah, it was.

00:18:50,197 --> 00:18:52,399
LITRA:
All right, first we mirror it,

00:18:52,466 --> 00:18:55,368
and then we remove
the background texture

00:18:55,435 --> 00:18:58,038
of the cotton weave.

00:18:58,105 --> 00:18:59,873
Sharpen the contrast,
will you?

00:19:00,941 --> 00:19:03,009
"Madame..."

00:19:03,076 --> 00:19:05,378
"Matryoshka's."

00:19:05,445 --> 00:19:07,347
"Tuesday...

00:19:07,414 --> 00:19:09,516
g a.m."?

00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:12,052
Some kind of appointment.
"g a.m."?

00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:13,653
Do you know what <i>matryoshkaare?</i>

00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,455
Sure.

00:19:15,522 --> 00:19:17,991
( <i>laughs</i> ):
Russian nesting dolls.

00:19:18,058 --> 00:19:20,193
Oh, yeah, yeah,
the dolls that look alike,

00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,129
that fit inside
of each other, right?

00:19:22,195 --> 00:19:23,630
My grandma had a set.

00:19:23,697 --> 00:19:26,500
Anyway, people who've gone
from writing Cyrillic to English

00:19:26,566 --> 00:19:29,970
often write their nines
as lowercase G's.

00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:41,760
( <i>clears throat</i> )

00:19:41,827 --> 00:19:43,795
You have appointment
for haircut?

00:19:43,862 --> 00:19:46,531
Nah, I'm trying to get a
Rastafarian thing going.

00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:51,837
Is there an actual
Madame Matryoshka?

00:19:51,903 --> 00:19:55,674
( <i>speaking Russian):</i>
<i>...polizia...</i>

00:19:55,741 --> 00:19:57,643
We're <i>polizia.</i> Yeah.

00:20:00,612 --> 00:20:02,514
Chloe Daniels.
What can I do for you?

00:20:02,581 --> 00:20:04,349
I'm Detective Jim Brass,
Las Vegas Police.

00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:06,051
This is Nick Stokes
from the Crime Lab.

00:20:06,118 --> 00:20:07,834
We're here about
Svetlana Melton.

00:20:07,834 --> 00:20:09,166
Yeah, she used
to work here.

00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,267
In what capacity?

00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:12,236
Hairdresser.

00:20:12,302 --> 00:20:13,303
You mean wife-to-be.

00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:14,471
Yeah.

00:20:14,538 --> 00:20:15,506
For money?

00:20:15,572 --> 00:20:16,507
Yeah.

00:20:16,573 --> 00:20:18,776
Sounds a lot like
prostitution to me.

00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:19,943
Yeah, well, it's not.

00:20:21,545 --> 00:20:23,347
Look, I didn't invent this.

00:20:23,414 --> 00:20:26,083
Go on line--
there are dozens of sites

00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:27,284
with thousands of women.

00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,853
They advertise these
exciting trips to Kiev.

00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,189
I just bring Kiev to you.

00:20:32,256 --> 00:20:36,226
I sponsor 90-day work visas,
teach the girls a trade.

00:20:36,293 --> 00:20:37,861
They cut hair for men.

00:20:37,928 --> 00:20:39,163
So men shop for a wife.

00:20:39,229 --> 00:20:40,631
You screen the guys?

00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:43,267
You pick up a woman at a bar,
does the bartender screen you?

00:20:43,334 --> 00:20:45,602
You take her home,
take her to your bed.

00:20:45,669 --> 00:20:47,771
How well did you screen her?

00:20:47,838 --> 00:20:49,440
You should be sainted.

00:20:49,506 --> 00:20:51,842
STOKES:
Mm, I don't know
about that.

00:20:51,909 --> 00:20:54,611
Svetlana ended up dead.

00:20:54,678 --> 00:20:57,348
You recognize this guy?

00:20:57,414 --> 00:20:58,782
DANIELS:
Yeah. Ken Wellstone.

00:20:58,849 --> 00:21:00,017
Lives down the street.

00:21:00,084 --> 00:21:01,752
Actually comes in for haircuts.

00:21:01,819 --> 00:21:03,487
Isn't interested
in my service.

00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:05,222
Not the marrying kind,
I guess.

00:21:05,289 --> 00:21:07,458
Yeah, I-I'm sorry,
there seems to be

00:21:07,524 --> 00:21:09,793
a really fine line
here between, uh...

00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:12,129
peddling marriage
and peddling flesh.

00:21:12,196 --> 00:21:14,031
When is marriage
anything else?

00:21:14,098 --> 00:21:15,632
BRASS:
Nick is, uh...

00:21:15,699 --> 00:21:16,967
he's an old-fashioned guy.

00:21:17,034 --> 00:21:18,936
Really? ( <i>laughs</i> )

00:21:19,003 --> 00:21:21,805
Well, what do you think
engagement rings are?

00:21:21,872 --> 00:21:24,742
Just proof that a man
can pay for his bride.

00:21:24,808 --> 00:21:27,011
Look, caveman
would go steal a woman

00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:28,512
from a neighboring clan.

00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:31,415
He'd tie her hands and her feet
till she wouldn't run away.

00:21:31,482 --> 00:21:33,417
Once she'd stay put,

00:21:33,484 --> 00:21:37,054
he would only tie her finger,
just to remind her.

00:21:37,121 --> 00:21:39,156
So you're a romantic.

00:21:39,223 --> 00:21:40,891
Marriage is not romance.

00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:43,093
It's a contract with the state.

00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,995
It's an investment
in your future.

00:21:45,062 --> 00:21:48,365
I'm not making it about money,
it just is.

00:21:52,469 --> 00:21:55,239
Uh, she cut my hair.

00:21:55,305 --> 00:21:58,409
She licked your cone.

00:21:58,475 --> 00:22:00,611
Well, I-I took
Svetlana out once

00:22:00,678 --> 00:22:02,880
for... for ice cream.

00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:04,748
It was...
it was a hot day.

00:22:04,815 --> 00:22:06,183
That's it?
Yeah, that's it.

00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,818
She, uh, gave me
some sob story

00:22:07,885 --> 00:22:10,321
about how she was married
to some abusive guy,

00:22:10,387 --> 00:22:11,789
you know, and how, uh...

00:22:11,855 --> 00:22:14,992
She begged me
to help, and...

00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:16,260
blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:22:16,327 --> 00:22:18,462
I don't... I don't need
that kind of drama.

00:22:18,529 --> 00:22:20,431
Mr. Wellstone,
what do you do for a living?

00:22:20,497 --> 00:22:22,299
I'm a real estate agent.

00:22:22,366 --> 00:22:23,934
You're not in construction
or anything?

00:22:24,001 --> 00:22:26,170
No. Why?

00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:30,240
Something happen to Svetlana?

00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:31,675
Yeah, she was murdered.

00:22:33,577 --> 00:22:36,213
Oh.

00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,715
We're gonna need to
get a DNA sample

00:22:37,781 --> 00:22:40,584
from you, and I'm gonna take
a look around your place.

00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:43,354
Is that cool?
Sure. Yeah, go ahead.

00:23:18,255 --> 00:23:20,691

00:23:40,277 --> 00:23:43,380
Well, if you're here,
it can't be good.

00:23:43,447 --> 00:23:45,015
Can I come in?

00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:48,585
Want to ask me
if I'm drunk?

00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:53,112
We both know that's
not your problem.

00:23:53,179 --> 00:23:55,748
I spoke to Catherine.

00:23:57,316 --> 00:23:58,985
Ecklie?

00:23:59,051 --> 00:24:00,620
He wants me to fire you.

00:24:00,686 --> 00:24:01,954
I figured.

00:24:02,021 --> 00:24:03,623
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:24:03,689 --> 00:24:05,691
Can I get you anything?

00:24:05,758 --> 00:24:08,661
Sure. An explanation.

00:24:08,728 --> 00:24:12,498
I... lost my temper.

00:24:12,565 --> 00:24:15,501
That seems to be happening
quite a bit.

00:24:15,568 --> 00:24:18,104
Do you know why?

00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:19,639
What difference
does it make?

00:24:19,705 --> 00:24:21,040
I'm still fired.

00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:24,410
It makes a difference to me.

00:24:26,746 --> 00:24:29,315
I have a problem with authority.

00:24:29,382 --> 00:24:32,352
I choose men who are
emotionally unavailable.

00:24:32,418 --> 00:24:34,387
I'm self-destructive.

00:24:34,454 --> 00:24:36,322
All of the above.

00:24:36,389 --> 00:24:39,292
Have you ever gone a week
without a rationalization?

00:24:42,095 --> 00:24:43,896
It's from <i>The Big Chill.</i>

00:24:43,963 --> 00:24:48,201
One of the characters
explaining a basic
fact of life--

00:24:48,267 --> 00:24:51,904
that rationalizations
are more important to us

00:24:51,971 --> 00:24:53,072
than sex even.

00:24:53,139 --> 00:24:56,009
I am not rationalizing anything.

00:24:56,075 --> 00:24:58,044
I crossed the line
with Catherine,

00:24:58,111 --> 00:25:01,959
and I was insubordinate
to Ecklie.

00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:03,694
Why?

00:25:03,761 --> 00:25:05,229
Leave it alone.

00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:06,563
No, Sara.

00:25:08,098 --> 00:25:09,333
What do you want from me?

00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,536
I want to know
why you're so angry.

00:25:17,834 --> 00:25:19,375
It's funny...

00:25:19,375 --> 00:25:20,677
the things that you remember

00:25:20,743 --> 00:25:22,645
and the things that you don't,
you know.

00:25:22,712 --> 00:25:27,550
There was a smell
of iron in the air.

00:25:27,617 --> 00:25:31,788
Cast-off on the bedroom wall.

00:25:31,855 --> 00:25:36,359
There was this young cop
puking his guts.

00:25:36,426 --> 00:25:40,330
I remember the woman
who took me to foster care.

00:25:40,396 --> 00:25:42,599
I can't remember her name.

00:25:42,665 --> 00:25:45,301
Which is strange, you know,

00:25:45,368 --> 00:25:48,972
'cause I couldn't let go
of her hand.

00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:56,679
Well...
the mind has its filters.

00:25:56,746 --> 00:26:01,184
I do remember the looks.

00:26:01,251 --> 00:26:05,422
I became the girl whose father
was stabbed to death.

00:26:10,126 --> 00:26:12,595
Do you think there's
a murder gene?

00:26:15,732 --> 00:26:17,133
I don't believe that genes

00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,202
are a predictor
of violent behavior.

00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:25,253
You wouldn't know that
in my house.

00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,456
The fights, the yelling,
the trips to the hospital.

00:26:28,523 --> 00:26:31,393
I thought it was the way
that everybody lived.

00:26:31,459 --> 00:26:39,835
When my mother killed my father,

00:26:39,901 --> 00:26:42,437
I found out that it wasn't.

00:26:47,142 --> 00:26:48,477
( <i>sniffs</i> )

BRASS:
So the tar from your carpet
matches the tar

00:27:33,583 --> 00:27:35,585
that Svetlana Melton
was buried in.

00:27:35,652 --> 00:27:36,620
Tar... I... where?

00:27:36,686 --> 00:27:37,888
I mean, I have no idea

00:27:37,954 --> 00:27:39,389
what you're talking about.

00:27:39,456 --> 00:27:40,790
We also found your
blood on her parka

00:27:40,857 --> 00:27:42,492
that she wore to the
hospital two years ago.

00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:43,660
I can explain that.
That was from...

00:27:43,727 --> 00:27:44,928
So can we-- you beat her,

00:27:44,995 --> 00:27:46,463
you killed her,
you buried her.

00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:47,931
No, I didn't.

00:27:47,998 --> 00:27:49,866
No, stop, please.

00:27:49,933 --> 00:27:52,202
She... she ran away.

00:28:00,542 --> 00:28:02,110
Put that in here.

00:28:03,145 --> 00:28:05,013
"Ken, do not look for me.

00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,515
"I need to go away.

00:28:06,582 --> 00:28:08,317
Svetlana."

00:28:08,383 --> 00:28:09,651
You know, after everything

00:28:09,718 --> 00:28:11,587
that we'd been through
and everything,

00:28:11,653 --> 00:28:13,188
this just seemed really, uh...

00:28:13,255 --> 00:28:14,656
It was cold.

00:28:14,723 --> 00:28:15,924
Didn't sound like her.

00:28:15,991 --> 00:28:17,326
She usually called me...

00:28:17,392 --> 00:28:19,328
Kenski.

00:28:19,394 --> 00:28:21,263
So what was your relationship,
Kenski?

00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:22,798
What was my relationship?

00:28:22,865 --> 00:28:24,499
My relationship was, uh...

00:28:28,337 --> 00:28:30,772
We were, uh... we were in love.

00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:32,908
How did her husband feel
about that?

00:28:32,975 --> 00:28:35,077
Her husband bought her,
so he thought he owned her.

00:28:35,143 --> 00:28:36,745
And Svetlana was way out
of his league.

00:28:36,812 --> 00:28:39,014
And what she wanted to do was
fast track her divorce.

00:28:39,081 --> 00:28:40,749
So she thought maybe
if she made it look

00:28:40,816 --> 00:28:41,850
like Andrew had beat her,

00:28:41,917 --> 00:28:42,851
that that would do it,

00:28:42,918 --> 00:28:44,519
but that didn't do it
because he'd actually

00:28:44,586 --> 00:28:46,455
never hit her. So...

00:28:46,521 --> 00:28:48,757
How'd she break her jaw?

00:28:51,827 --> 00:28:53,829
Huh?

00:28:56,098 --> 00:28:59,067
She begged me.

00:28:59,134 --> 00:29:03,572
Please, Kenski. Please.

00:29:03,639 --> 00:29:06,308
Hit me hard on face.

00:29:06,375 --> 00:29:08,477
It is only way
for me to leave

00:29:08,544 --> 00:29:10,579
this horrible man.

00:29:10,646 --> 00:29:12,714
Please, Kenski.

00:29:12,781 --> 00:29:15,851
Hit me if you love me.

00:29:28,797 --> 00:29:30,265

Well, life is short.

00:30:31,744 --> 00:30:32,846

This makes it much simpler,
doesn't it?

00:30:35,048 --> 00:30:37,050
It's not supposed to be simple.

00:30:37,117 --> 00:30:39,119
Complicated is the whole point.

00:30:39,185 --> 00:30:40,887
It is?
Yeah.

00:30:40,954 --> 00:30:42,222
Hey, wait a minute.

You're not telling me
you're into this stuff?

00:30:44,324 --> 00:30:45,425

'cause you're not even speaking
the same language.

00:30:57,704 --> 00:30:58,872

I got blood spatter
next to the hair dye.

Svetlana was a tall girl.

Maybe
she was sitting.

DNA from the bloodstains on

not get a match.

pretty tacky.

00:33:25,051 --> 00:33:26,820
But it's cause for a warrant.

00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:38,965
Everything in order?

00:33:39,032 --> 00:33:40,600
I'm not giving you
a damn thing

00:33:40,667 --> 00:33:42,235
until I read
every last word.

00:33:42,302 --> 00:33:44,337
Take as long as you want.
We're going to be here a while.

00:33:46,973 --> 00:33:49,709
Do you believe this?

00:33:49,776 --> 00:33:52,745
What, that the guy
locks up his food?

00:33:54,914 --> 00:33:57,050
Locks his wife out.

00:33:57,117 --> 00:33:59,385
You think he's trying
to protect his investment?

00:33:59,452 --> 00:34:01,221
Weight goes up.
Value goes down.

00:34:01,287 --> 00:34:04,524
Control her food, control
her destiny, I don't know.

00:34:04,591 --> 00:34:06,226
Look at this.

00:34:06,292 --> 00:34:08,228
She can't even
call out for pizza.

00:34:08,294 --> 00:34:10,096
Or help.

00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,068
The necklace.

00:34:16,102 --> 00:34:17,770
No, no, no. No, no.
I got it.

00:34:17,837 --> 00:34:20,273
I got it.

00:34:34,041 --> 00:34:35,809
( <i>computer beeps</i> )

00:35:04,204 --> 00:35:05,939
CATHERINE:
<i>Svetlana's blood</i>

00:35:06,006 --> 00:35:07,040
was on the necklace

00:35:07,107 --> 00:35:10,310
worn by Andrew Melton's
current child bride.

00:35:10,377 --> 00:35:12,146
Could you imagine
a control freak like him

00:35:12,212 --> 00:35:15,382
having to spend the night
in jail on a phony abuse charge?

00:35:15,449 --> 00:35:17,551
You know he went looking for her
when he got out.

00:35:27,995 --> 00:35:29,463
It'll never stand up, Rick.

00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:30,831
You know how it is,

00:35:30,898 --> 00:35:33,400
they'll say the blood
<i>could've</i> come from anywhere.

00:35:33,467 --> 00:35:35,669
She <i>could've</i> left
the necklace behind.

00:35:35,736 --> 00:35:37,137
We need a murder weapon.

00:35:37,204 --> 00:35:38,505
Yeah, well, good luck
on that one.

00:35:38,572 --> 00:35:41,542
Crime's over two years old.

00:35:41,608 --> 00:35:42,776
( <i>groans</i> ):
All righty.

00:35:42,843 --> 00:35:44,178
We know that this guy did it.

00:35:44,244 --> 00:35:45,512
How do we prove it?

00:35:45,579 --> 00:35:47,581
Can we prove he buried her?

00:35:47,648 --> 00:35:49,650
I'm not convinced he did.

00:35:49,716 --> 00:35:51,552
Svetlana was buried

00:35:51,618 --> 00:35:52,786
in a pre-
existing grave.

00:35:52,853 --> 00:35:54,254
Right on top of
Jane Doe Bottom.

00:35:54,321 --> 00:35:58,058
And both girls' fingertips were
removed by blending shears.

00:35:58,125 --> 00:35:59,726
Which we also found
at the salon.

00:35:59,793 --> 00:36:01,228
And the only people

00:36:01,295 --> 00:36:05,265
with full access to the salon
are Chloe and Vlad.

00:36:05,332 --> 00:36:08,302
Yeah, and Chloe doesn't
really seem like the type

00:36:08,368 --> 00:36:10,103
that gets her hands dirty.

00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:12,739
All right, the relative size
of the letters

00:36:12,806 --> 00:36:15,843
and the spacing between them

00:36:15,909 --> 00:36:19,580
appear to be consistent with
both Vlad's appointment book

00:36:19,646 --> 00:36:22,516
and the good-bye note
left by Svetlana.

00:36:22,583 --> 00:36:24,351
My opinion is
it's the same writer.

00:36:24,418 --> 00:36:29,923
Well, it looks like the Vladski
tricked the Kenski.

00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:32,559
According to
your credit card statements,

00:36:32,626 --> 00:36:35,429
you purchased
several buckets of tar

00:36:35,496 --> 00:36:38,298
two and five years ago...

00:36:38,365 --> 00:36:40,567
at a local hardware store.

00:36:40,634 --> 00:36:43,170
Tell me, what's
a receptionist
at a hair salon

00:36:43,237 --> 00:36:45,072
doing with that much tar?

00:36:45,139 --> 00:36:47,574
In Russia, I work
for certain family.

00:36:47,641 --> 00:36:49,076
When they want body
taken care of,

00:36:49,143 --> 00:36:52,279
I go to oil field,
dump body in tar.

00:36:52,346 --> 00:36:54,948
None ever found.

00:36:55,015 --> 00:36:57,451
Sounds like fun.

00:36:57,518 --> 00:36:59,253
Tell me about Svetlana.

00:36:59,319 --> 00:37:02,456
Girl already dead.
Nothing I can do.

00:37:02,523 --> 00:37:04,391
So you're saying
you did not kill her?

00:37:04,458 --> 00:37:06,293
No.

00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,095
Then why'd you cover it up?

00:37:08,162 --> 00:37:11,565
Svetlana, time to lock up.

00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,435
BROWN:
<i>You didn't call 911?</i>

00:37:15,502 --> 00:37:18,272
<i>You cleaned up the scene,</i>

00:37:18,338 --> 00:37:24,444
<i>buried her, and then</i>
<i>you left a note for Ken.</i>

00:37:24,511 --> 00:37:28,315
America is land of opportunity.

00:37:28,382 --> 00:37:30,217
Her death should be
a total loss?

00:37:31,585 --> 00:37:35,455
Andrew Melton
is very good tipper.

00:37:35,522 --> 00:37:40,461
Was Andrew Melton a very good
tipper five years ago?

00:37:42,629 --> 00:37:44,765
No.

00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:47,301
Svetlana wasn't buried alone.

00:37:47,367 --> 00:37:49,269
There was another body
in that grave.

00:37:49,336 --> 00:37:52,906
Many girls
want American husband.

00:37:52,973 --> 00:37:55,843
Sometimes Chloe
can't get them a visa.

00:37:55,909 --> 00:37:58,078
They come anyway...

00:38:07,821 --> 00:38:10,524
She came here in a suitcase,

00:38:10,591 --> 00:38:12,626
but she was dead
on arrival,

00:38:12,693 --> 00:38:14,561
so you take her out
to the desert

00:38:14,628 --> 00:38:16,663
and bury her in a hole?

00:38:24,071 --> 00:38:27,441
Again, girl already dead.

00:38:27,508 --> 00:38:29,910
Nothing I can do.

00:38:35,482 --> 00:38:39,119
Boy, women can really
drive you crazy, huh?

00:38:39,186 --> 00:38:41,555
I mean, this perfect
creature who needs you,

00:38:41,622 --> 00:38:43,624
who loves you.

00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:46,160
You think you've got
it all worked out.

00:38:46,226 --> 00:38:48,362
Your Christmas card's
gonna look like

00:38:48,428 --> 00:38:52,466
the Sears catalogue,
right?

00:38:52,533 --> 00:38:54,434
And then what?

00:38:54,501 --> 00:38:55,402
I mean, you give
her stuff.

00:38:55,469 --> 00:38:57,871
You give her clothes,
money and shelter,

00:38:57,938 --> 00:38:59,840
and then she goes and
makes up some bogus story

00:38:59,907 --> 00:39:01,175
about how you
attacked her.

00:39:01,241 --> 00:39:02,776
Which I never did.

00:39:05,379 --> 00:39:07,247
Man...

00:39:07,314 --> 00:39:09,116
a love like that.

00:39:09,183 --> 00:39:11,585
So pure.

00:39:11,652 --> 00:39:14,888
I mean, men have robbed banks
for less,

00:39:14,955 --> 00:39:17,124
put their life
on the line...

00:39:17,191 --> 00:39:19,993
would kill to protect it.

00:39:21,361 --> 00:39:23,230
Everywhere we went,

00:39:23,297 --> 00:39:27,201
men were making love to her
with their eyes,

00:39:27,267 --> 00:39:28,469
defiling her

00:39:28,535 --> 00:39:29,837
with their thoughts.

00:39:29,903 --> 00:39:32,272
It got so bad
it wasn't safe

00:39:32,339 --> 00:39:36,109
to let her leave the house.

00:39:36,176 --> 00:39:41,148
But then she got lonely.

00:39:41,215 --> 00:39:43,650
Like a person
I didn't recognize.

00:39:43,717 --> 00:39:46,553
You made her an American.

00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:48,155
In all the good ways...

00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:52,759
...and the bad.

00:39:54,027 --> 00:39:55,529
Svetlana!

00:39:57,064 --> 00:39:58,432
You told them I hit you?!

00:39:58,499 --> 00:40:00,934
Why would you do that? Huh?

00:40:01,001 --> 00:40:02,903
Is that what you want?

00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:04,771
Huh? You want me
to hit you?!

00:40:07,875 --> 00:40:10,210
That you want?!

00:40:12,846 --> 00:40:16,350
She never appreciated me.

00:40:25,526 --> 00:40:27,194
Andrew, what happens?

00:40:27,261 --> 00:40:28,996
Andrew?

00:40:29,062 --> 00:40:30,731
It'll be okay, honey.

00:40:30,798 --> 00:40:32,966
It'll all work out.

00:40:33,033 --> 00:40:34,468
You'll see.

00:40:39,139 --> 00:40:40,941
You wanted to talk to me
about Sara?

00:40:41,008 --> 00:40:43,043
I haven't received
her disciplinary action.

00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:44,278
What's the holdup?

00:40:44,344 --> 00:40:46,046
Well, I'm not firing her.

00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:51,685
What action are you taking?

00:40:51,752 --> 00:40:54,555
I've taken it.

00:40:54,621 --> 00:40:56,356
I thought I was clear.

00:40:56,423 --> 00:40:57,491
You were.

00:40:57,558 --> 00:40:59,259
Now let me be clear.

00:40:59,326 --> 00:41:02,463
Sara's behavior is a direct
result of my management.

00:41:02,529 --> 00:41:03,897
So I should fire you.

00:41:03,964 --> 00:41:05,098
But you won't.

00:41:06,233 --> 00:41:08,869
Look, Gil...

00:41:08,936 --> 00:41:10,704
I've been there.
We're human.

00:41:10,771 --> 00:41:13,240
We get attached to people,
we try to fix their problems.

00:41:13,307 --> 00:41:14,374
It doesn't work.

00:41:14,441 --> 00:41:16,944
She's a great criminalist,
Conrad.

00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:18,212
And I need her.

00:41:18,278 --> 00:41:20,914
I'm sure you do.

00:41:20,981 --> 00:41:23,817
You know what?

00:41:23,884 --> 00:41:25,986
She's a loose cannon
with a gun.

00:41:26,053 --> 00:41:27,792
And she's all yours.
