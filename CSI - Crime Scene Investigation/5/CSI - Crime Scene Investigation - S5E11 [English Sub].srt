six lands and grooves.

and overlook
the absence of blood

00:06:55,209 --> 00:06:58,812
on the chair as well as the fact
that her skirt is raised.

00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:01,081
This body was posed,

00:07:01,148 --> 00:07:03,284
and quite beautifully,
I might add.

00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:06,487
Moriarty, if evil
for evil's sake were

00:07:06,554 --> 00:07:09,189

it would be your diagnosis.

00:07:09,256 --> 00:07:10,257
Gentlemen, your disdain

00:07:10,324 --> 00:07:12,526

from the truth.

00:07:12,593 --> 00:07:15,696
The wedding picture
on the wall?

00:07:15,763 --> 00:07:17,631

were husband and wife.

00:07:17,698 --> 00:07:18,632
As usual, Miss Adler,

00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:20,935
your deduction is correct.

00:07:21,001 --> 00:07:23,537
It was indeed a crime
of passion.

00:07:23,604 --> 00:07:26,307
Sounds fun-- when was the last
time you saw Dennis Kingsley?

00:07:26,373 --> 00:07:28,442
Last Thursday.

00:07:28,509 --> 00:07:29,843
He said that he was
going to make

00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:31,445
this meeting really special.

00:07:31,512 --> 00:07:32,713

00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,282
our time here tonight has ended,

00:07:35,349 --> 00:07:37,618
and that, I fear,
is the gist of the announcement

00:07:37,685 --> 00:07:39,787
I must share with you now.

00:07:39,853 --> 00:07:42,723
Next week will be

00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:45,359
the final meeting
of our society,

00:07:45,426 --> 00:07:48,028
but I give you my
word: it shall be

00:07:48,095 --> 00:07:51,398
an evening none of you
will ever forget.

00:07:51,465 --> 00:07:54,301
I didn't think
that he meant this.

00:07:54,368 --> 00:07:55,703
We're going
to need names

00:07:55,769 --> 00:07:57,304
and contact information.

00:07:57,371 --> 00:07:58,305

00:08:01,609 --> 00:08:04,511

So you actually think this is
something other than suicide?

00:08:13,087 --> 00:08:15,055

to drop the accent.

00:08:15,122 --> 00:08:17,591

It's just hard to believe

00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:37,798
that's what killed him.

00:10:37,865 --> 00:10:39,166
I didn't see any skid marks

00:10:39,233 --> 00:10:40,701
on the road up there.

00:10:40,768 --> 00:10:42,303
There's no signs
he tried to brake.

00:10:42,369 --> 00:10:44,371
Well, maybe he fell asleep
at the wheel.

00:10:44,438 --> 00:10:45,839
Uh, coming over that embankment?

00:10:45,906 --> 00:10:47,107
That would've woke him up.

Did the paramedics open
this door?

00:10:54,114 --> 00:10:56,283
Vitals were taken
through the open window.

00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:59,220
Door was ajar when we
arrived on the scene.

00:11:03,457 --> 00:11:04,692
Hey, Nick,

00:11:04,758 --> 00:11:06,527

00:11:06,594 --> 00:11:08,662
Oh.
Guy was getting high.

00:11:09,697 --> 00:11:10,631
Think that's the reason

00:11:10,698 --> 00:11:11,966
he missed the curve up there?

00:11:12,032 --> 00:11:12,900
You think?

00:11:18,105 --> 00:11:20,040
Ah. We got a wallet.

00:11:20,107 --> 00:11:21,609
Yeah, yeah.

00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:26,347
Cory Demayo.

00:11:26,413 --> 00:11:27,982
Fits the description.

00:11:28,048 --> 00:11:29,250
No cash, no plastic.

00:11:29,316 --> 00:11:31,352
This is a pretty
remote place

00:11:31,418 --> 00:11:32,353
for an accident.

00:11:32,419 --> 00:11:33,721
But you think someone saw it,

00:11:33,787 --> 00:11:35,256
took advantage of the situation?

00:11:35,322 --> 00:11:37,625
Maybe he wasn't alone.

00:11:37,691 --> 00:11:39,193
Maybe the passenger
survived,

00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:42,229

took off.

This guy really dress up
like Sherlock Holmes?

00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,482
At least once a
week, evidently,

00:12:35,549 --> 00:12:37,651
like those Civil
War re-enactors.

00:12:37,718 --> 00:12:39,653
I, uh, never
understood that.

00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,323
Yeah. In any event,
C.O.D. was no surprise.

00:12:42,389 --> 00:12:43,624
Perforating

Got the tox.

00:12:47,161 --> 00:12:49,330
Cocaine metabolites
in the vic's urine.

500 nanograms per M.O.

You only see levels that high

Those are the

00:12:55,669 --> 00:12:57,071
SANDERS:
Yeah, but
there was also

00:12:57,137 --> 00:12:59,940
morphine in his blood

morphine sulfate

and water.

Morphine metabolites
in his system

He wasn't on
street junk.

00:13:10,851 --> 00:13:12,753
This is pharmaceutical-
grade stuff.

00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,788
And at a pretty hefty dose, too.

00:13:14,855 --> 00:13:16,757
How fast for the injection
to take effect?

Not much time
to undo the works,

00:13:22,763 --> 00:13:24,298
put away
his antique syringe,

00:13:24,365 --> 00:13:27,535
pick up a gun
and blow his brains out.

00:13:27,601 --> 00:13:28,969
Wait a minute.

00:13:29,036 --> 00:13:32,006
The GSR test on his
hand was positive.

00:13:32,072 --> 00:13:33,574
What are you getting at?

00:13:38,012 --> 00:13:39,980
Well, maybe Sherlock
had some help.

<i>Hey, when was the last time</i>

you saw Cory?

00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:51,563
Yesterday.
Just kicking it, like me.

00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:54,633
How'd you get that
bruise on your dome, man?

00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,635
Oh, uh, windsurfing.

00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:58,137
Hey, you guys go

00:13:58,203 --> 00:13:59,405
out there together?

00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:01,874
Yeah. Well, he's got
the wheels, so...

00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,242
So you drove
back together?

00:14:03,308 --> 00:14:05,144
No.

00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:06,779
I sort of hooked up
with this chick,

00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:07,780
so I bounced.

00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:09,882
Nice. You know
the chick's name?

00:14:09,948 --> 00:14:11,150
Uh, Jennifer.

00:14:11,216 --> 00:14:12,384
Jennifer who?

00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:16,789
Jennifer, uh...
nipple ring.

00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:18,824
( <i>chuckling</i> ):
Jennifer Nipple Ring.

00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:21,960
Lawery, were you guys,

00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,796
uh, getting
high yesterday?

00:14:23,862 --> 00:14:24,797
You smoke some weed?

00:14:24,863 --> 00:14:26,565
Nope.

00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:27,499
No?

00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:29,401
All right, let
me tell you

00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:30,502
what I think happened.

00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:34,173
You and Cory got stoned,
and you drove away.

00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,141
Cory lost control
of the Jeep...

00:14:39,244 --> 00:14:41,013
<i>...at which point,</i>
<i>you couldn't wake him up,</i>

00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,115
<i>so you decided to take</i>
<i>advantage of the situation,</i>

00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:45,851
<i>and you rifle</i>
<i>through his wallet and leave.</i>

00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:47,619
Man, that is not what went down.

00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:49,188
You're looking at robbery,

00:14:49,254 --> 00:14:50,756
leaving the scene,
failure to report

00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:52,357
an accident.

00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:53,659
That's a lot of years, man.

00:14:53,725 --> 00:14:56,528
I didn't get back in the car
with Cory, and if I had,

00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:57,696
I wouldn't have left him!

00:14:57,763 --> 00:15:00,733
Lawery, we're going to need
a DNA sample from you.

00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:02,468
What? Why?

00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:03,469
Just to prove
that, uh,

00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:05,637
your lips weren't
on that joint

00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:06,972
that we found
in the Jeep.

00:15:08,006 --> 00:15:09,475
All right, man.

00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:12,544
Let me just be straight
with you guys for a second here.

00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:14,046
I admit,

00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:16,982
Cory and I sparked up
at the lake, okay?

00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:19,952
But then he took off.

00:15:20,018 --> 00:15:23,155
Three weeks ago,
I was busted for pot, okay?

00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:25,224
The judge gave me
diversion.

00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:30,162
You guys file charges,
I'm screwed.

00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:32,931
I will never get
into dental school.

00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:38,504
The fragment you found
at the scene?

00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:39,838
It's a mother of pearl.

00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:42,174
It could be from an ornament
or a piece of jewelry.

00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:43,675
It could be
from a lot of things.

00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:45,344
Yeah, that it could,
Mr. Proficiency.

00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:48,046
I also I.D.'d the ash
on the floor.

00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,815
Perique tobacco,

00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:51,850
grown in only one spot
on Earth:

00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:53,619
St. James Parish,
Louisiana.

00:15:53,685 --> 00:15:56,021
The same as the
umber of tobacco in
the victim's slipper?

00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:57,689
No, completely
different make.

00:15:57,756 --> 00:15:59,324
Cheap, strong,
low-grade stuff.

00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:00,993
Shag tobacco.

00:16:01,059 --> 00:16:03,328
Yeah. How'd you know?

00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:04,963
That's what Holmes smoked.

00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:08,934
Bad habit, even for
a fictional character.

00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:13,472
You do have two suspects
with pipes.

00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:17,609
Yeah... and, uh,
smoking kills.

00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:31,690
MAN:
We got to stop meeting
like this, baby.

00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:33,158
How was your game?

00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:35,761
I'm swinging a hot
stick tonight, babe.

00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:39,898
Can I get you something?

00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:41,934
No, I'm just looking
for someone.

00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:46,038
You're staring at me.

00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:48,907
Oh.

00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:51,009
Uh... I'm sorry.

00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:53,746
I didn't recognize you
from last night.

00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:56,515
Is that a friend
of yours?

00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:58,450
( <i>laughs</i> ):
Give me a break.

00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,252
Did that guy look
like a friend of mine?

00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:02,454
Every time he touches
me, I want to kick
him in the scrotum,

00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,289
but he's a big tipper.

00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,625
I've got a sick mother
and rent to pay.

00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,327
Well, I just have
a couple of questions.

00:17:08,393 --> 00:17:10,329
At Denny Kingsley's,
you were smoking a pipe.

00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,700
Yeah... a Meerschaum.

00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:16,201
I'm going to need it.

00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:17,736
Why?

00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:20,305
Let me worry about that, okay?

00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:24,143
Uh, J.J., can you hand
me my purse, please?

00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,811
Okay.

00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:38,924
Dr. Watson?

00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:40,492
I'm Sara Sidle
with the Crime Lab.

00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,493
Hello.

00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,995
Do you have
a minute?

00:17:43,061 --> 00:17:46,165
I'm here to collect
your Meerschaum pipe

00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,833
as well as any other
tobacco products

00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,601
you might have in
your possession.

00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:52,071
I don't smoke
anything illegal.

00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:53,639
You haven't been
accused of that.

00:17:53,705 --> 00:17:56,608
Anyway, my pipe
is at home.

00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:58,644
No problem. Let's go.

00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,446
Look, I'm working.

00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:01,914
We've already talked
to your boss,

00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,282
and I have a warrant.

00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:04,650
Let me get that for you.

00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:12,791
Were you wearing
those shoes

00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:14,359
at your last
club meeting?

00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,628
Yeah. They're
not technically right

00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:18,697
for the period,
but black leather shoes

00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:19,865
are black leather shoes.

00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,501
I'm not the same stickler
for detail that Denny was.

00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:24,770
Apparently not.

00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:26,638
Vic was physically fit.

00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:28,474
Scratches and abrasions
are antemortem,

00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,142
unrelated
to the accident.

00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:33,345
The contusion on the
forehead was, uh,
superficial, right?

00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:34,646
You are right.

00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:36,949
Okay, so what's the cause
of death, Doc?

00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:38,517
Undetermined.

00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,553
But you're still working
on it, right?

00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,589
Unless some other evidence comes
to light, I'm done.

00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:45,357
Sometimes I can't tell you
why they die.

00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:54,466
What you got?

00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:56,034
Passenger door latch
is busted.

00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:58,637
It could've happened
during the accident.

00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:00,806
Well, that is consistent
with the roommate's story.

00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:02,341
Says he wasn't in
the passenger seat

00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:03,675
during the time
of the crash.

00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:05,511
What'd you get
back from Tox?

00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:08,180
Tox came back positive
for low levels of cannabis.

00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:10,449
I know marijuana slows
your reaction time,

00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:12,918
but based on the lack
of skid marks

00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,520
at the scene,
the position of the vehicle,

00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:16,522
I don't think this guy
ever hit the brakes.

00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:17,756
Well, maybe he did
hit the brakes.

00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:18,757
Did you check 'em?

00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,793
Come on, you're
a bigger boy than me.

00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:23,362
Yeah, you can't do
anything yourself,
can you?

00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:29,468
You ready?

00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:31,870
Yeah, yeah, put
your back into it.

00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:33,572
( <i>grunts</i> )

00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:37,409
Brakes work.

00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:39,044
Brake lights are working,

00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:41,046
so that means
the battery's okay.

00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:42,548
Yeah, but the gauges
are all off.

00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:44,083
The panel's not even working.

00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:46,985
Okay, ignition was on,

00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:50,556
but the engine wasn't running,
so... what?

00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:51,890
No gas?

00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:56,762

That tank is full of fuel, man.

Cory was in good shape.

decent condition, so...

what happened

Yes, and when is
that going to change?

00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:10,976
Not anytime soon-- Catherine,
there are budget constraints.

00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,111
You'll have to prioritize.

00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:14,012
Should we come back?

00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:15,114
No, no, no,
come on in.

00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,115
So, how's your,

00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:18,884
uh, your surfer dude case?

00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:20,886
Uh, the victim's
roommate admits they
got high together,

00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:23,288
but denies being
in the Jeep at the
time of the accident.

00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:25,424
At this point,
we can't place him there.

00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:27,025
Brakes on the Jeep
were functioning.

00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:29,495

No.

Close it.

You can't be a cop

I was Dr. Watson...

00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,534
Denny was Sherlock Holmes.

"There can only be one."

00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:53,138
So, when Denny wasn't there,
you could be Sherlock.

I suppose.

Denny was a friend,

00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:04,016
and if I wanted to be Sherlock,
all I had to do was wait.

00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:05,984
Denny was quitting.

00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,653
We talked about it a lot.

He said he was going back
to his wife.

00:23:09,188 --> 00:23:10,122
So you went

00:23:10,189 --> 00:23:11,156
to his house, you shot him,

00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,758
and then you left,
and you came back later

00:23:12,825 --> 00:23:14,760
with your pals and acted
like nothing happened.

00:23:14,827 --> 00:23:16,328

where he was killed.

No way.

00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,839
Look, there are two kinds
of stories: fact and fiction.

00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:27,840
I know that.

I-I wasn't there.
I didn't kill Denny.

These blood drops
aren't uniform.

00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,267
Some of them

00:23:55,334 --> 00:23:57,636
are clotted red cells,
but others are pure serum.

00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:03,142
It takes at least 20 minutes
for blood to clot and separate.

00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:04,476
If Watson killed Sherlock,

00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:06,678
the blood drops on his shoe
would all be the same.

00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:09,882
The killer takes some of the
victim's blood at the scene...

00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:14,219

on the undercarriage.

00:27:45,737 --> 00:27:48,206
And I found something similar
on the roll bar, as well.

00:27:48,272 --> 00:27:50,608
Well, that would indicate
some sort of electrical shock.

00:27:50,675 --> 00:27:51,876
Well,
if an electrical charge

00:27:51,943 --> 00:27:53,344
traveled through the Jeep,

00:27:53,411 --> 00:27:54,912
and shorted out the wiring,

00:27:54,979 --> 00:27:56,948
it would have shocked Cory,
as well.

00:27:57,014 --> 00:27:57,982
Like what, lightning?

00:27:58,049 --> 00:27:58,983

the hell out of his Jeep.

Let's go back out there
and check it out.

00:28:11,496 --> 00:28:15,666
Cory was coming from Lake Mead,
which is that way.

00:28:15,733 --> 00:28:16,834
Let's walk.

00:28:16,901 --> 00:28:18,169
Yeah.

( <i>camera shutter clicking</i> )

00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:55,039
Looks like a new splice
on those wires.

00:28:55,106 --> 00:28:57,308
Well, the power company

00:28:57,375 --> 00:28:58,609
originally called
that Jeep in.

00:28:58,676 --> 00:29:00,545
They must have
been out here
fixing the lines.

00:29:00,611 --> 00:29:01,979
Maybe it was a down line.

00:29:02,046 --> 00:29:03,314
That would give us

00:29:03,381 --> 00:29:05,416
the high voltage power source
right there.

00:29:05,483 --> 00:29:09,020
Yeah, but even if a live wire
struck the roll bar,

00:29:09,087 --> 00:29:11,489
the tires would have insulated
the vehicle.

00:29:11,556 --> 00:29:14,859
Right. Without a path to ground,
electricity is harmless.

00:29:16,761 --> 00:29:18,763
What about that road marker?

00:29:31,642 --> 00:29:33,811
It's bent in the direction

00:29:33,878 --> 00:29:35,313
Cory was driving.

00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,447

00:29:36,514 --> 00:29:38,383
Wasn't the undercarriage
of Cory's Jeep black?

( <i>tires screeching, squeaking)</i>

00:29:42,153 --> 00:29:44,789
This marker would
have grounded the Jeep.

00:29:44,856 --> 00:29:48,393
Completing the circuit,
and theoretically,

00:29:48,459 --> 00:29:50,495
electrocuting the vehicle.

00:30:20,558 --> 00:30:22,660
I want to go back
to the crime scene.

00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:36,274
I identified trace
on the edge of that chip,

00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:38,643
and it's red clay dust.

but these red clay bricks
are real.

00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:47,351
So, what are you looking for?

And if there was some kind
of struggle,

00:30:51,723 --> 00:30:54,058
maybe the killer
left behind

00:30:54,125 --> 00:30:57,962

or a strand of hair.

A shot of morphine

Sherlock drew his own blood
in advance

00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:52,865
and then sprayed it
on Watson's shoe

Why would he try and frame
his best friend in the process?

00:32:02,108 --> 00:32:03,542
Well, Watson said
they were friends,

00:32:03,609 --> 00:32:05,945
but who knows what kind
of relationship they really had.

00:32:06,011 --> 00:32:07,079
Maybe they hated
each other.

Maybe Dennis

00:32:08,314 --> 00:32:09,348

00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,795

00:34:05,297 --> 00:34:07,299
That would explain
why the Jeep wasn't running.

00:34:07,366 --> 00:34:09,101
Yeah, we called Nevada power,
and they confirmed

00:34:09,168 --> 00:34:11,137
there was a downed power line
the day of the accident.

the victim was electrocuted?

the fuses,

Okay.

the substance

on Watson's shoes later.

He had as much
to lose as you.

to give it all up and go back
to his family.

00:42:28,743 --> 00:42:30,512
Well done.

00:42:30,578 --> 00:42:32,647
I'm proud of you.

00:42:32,714 --> 00:42:34,249
Congratulations, Sanders.
Good work.

00:42:34,315 --> 00:42:36,518
Thank you.

00:42:37,685 --> 00:42:40,355
Okay, gang, there's
people to put in jail.

00:42:40,421 --> 00:42:42,190
Let's get back
to it, shall we?

00:42:42,257 --> 00:42:43,725
Come on,
come on, now.

00:42:43,792 --> 00:42:45,493
Party's over. Let's go.

00:42:48,029 --> 00:42:49,731
Good job.

00:42:52,834 --> 00:42:54,035
I don't get it.

00:42:54,102 --> 00:42:58,039
I got the wrong guy,
the wrong manner of death.

00:42:58,106 --> 00:42:59,707
I don't expect you to be correct

00:42:59,774 --> 00:43:01,843
in all your interpretations
all the time.

00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:03,278
You collected the evidence.

00:43:03,344 --> 00:43:05,346
You thought there
was something missing,

00:43:05,413 --> 00:43:08,249
you went back
and found it.

00:43:08,316 --> 00:43:10,151
Hey, that's the job.

00:43:10,218 --> 00:43:12,287
Congratulations, Greg.

00:43:12,353 --> 00:43:15,089
Thank you.

00:43:22,964 --> 00:43:24,632
( <i>all laughing</i> )

00:43:24,699 --> 00:43:26,201
Cheers. To you.
