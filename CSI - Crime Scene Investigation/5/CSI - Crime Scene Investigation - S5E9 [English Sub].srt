00:00:05,542 --> 00:00:07,344
JEFFREY SINCLAIR:
<i>I need you to answer</i>
<i>the same questions</i>

00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:08,712
I asked you at the first trial.

00:00:08,778 --> 00:00:10,380
And I need you
to answer them honestly,

00:00:10,447 --> 00:00:11,548
just as you did back then.

00:00:11,615 --> 00:00:15,719
On December 20, 1999,
you responded to a call

00:00:15,785 --> 00:00:17,220
at 2028 Boulder Highway.
Is that correct?

00:00:17,287 --> 00:00:18,755
Yes.

00:00:18,822 --> 00:00:19,890
Can you describe
the crime scene?

00:00:19,956 --> 00:00:21,024
It was a hardware store.

00:00:21,091 --> 00:00:22,559
I entered
through the back door.

00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:28,064
<i>The victim had been</i>
<i>severely beaten.</i>

00:00:28,131 --> 00:00:29,432
And our forensics determined

00:00:29,499 --> 00:00:31,201
that the murder weapon
was a wrench.

00:00:31,268 --> 00:00:34,704
Exhibit A.

00:00:34,771 --> 00:00:37,707
Do you recognize this object?

00:00:37,774 --> 00:00:40,243
Yes. I bagged
and processed this wrench.

00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:42,078
My initials are on the seal.

00:00:42,145 --> 00:00:43,513
Where did you find it?

00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,782
It was in a toolbox
under the kitchen sink

00:00:45,849 --> 00:00:47,551
at Garbett's Gourmet,

00:00:47,617 --> 00:00:49,452
which is a restaurant
next to the crime scene.

00:00:49,519 --> 00:00:50,687
Now, are you certain

00:00:50,754 --> 00:00:52,522
that this wrench
was used to kill the victim?

00:00:52,589 --> 00:00:54,724
Yes. We found trace blood
in the metal grooves.

00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:57,060
And the DNA matched
the victim's.

00:00:57,127 --> 00:00:59,362
What, if anything,
did you find on the handle?

00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:01,932
We found the defendant,
Mr. Garbett's fingerprints.

00:01:01,998 --> 00:01:04,467
We also found his prints
at the hardware store.

00:01:11,174 --> 00:01:13,510
What else did you find
at the store?

00:01:13,577 --> 00:01:15,312
GRISSOM:
<i>Well, it appeared</i>

00:01:15,378 --> 00:01:18,448
<i>that the killer tried</i>
<i>to cover his tracks</i>

00:01:18,515 --> 00:01:21,418
<i>by setting a fire,</i>
<i>a lack of sufficient</i>

00:01:21,484 --> 00:01:24,354
combustibles may have
thwarted his effort.

00:01:24,421 --> 00:01:25,622
Dr. Grissom.

00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:27,691
Exhibit B.

00:01:27,757 --> 00:01:30,126
Do you recognize this?

00:01:30,193 --> 00:01:32,829
Yes.
It's a matchbook.

00:01:32,896 --> 00:01:35,065
Did you find this
matchbook at the scene?

00:01:39,669 --> 00:01:42,339
Dr. Grissom, just
so we can be clear,

00:01:42,405 --> 00:01:44,341
this is the matchbook

00:01:44,407 --> 00:01:46,276
that you found at
the crime scene.

00:01:46,343 --> 00:01:47,344
Is that correct?

00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,182
Your Honor, may I take
a short break?

00:01:52,249 --> 00:01:55,318
Um... prosecution requests
a ten-minute recess.

00:01:55,385 --> 00:01:58,889
The defense asks that Dr.
Grissom answer the question now.

00:01:58,955 --> 00:02:01,157
Answer the question,
then we'll break.

00:02:01,224 --> 00:02:04,828
Yes, this is the matchbook
I collected at the crime scene.

00:02:04,895 --> 00:02:06,963
All right, we'll take
a ten-minute recess.

00:02:07,931 --> 00:02:10,400
So, you wanna tell me
what this is all about?

00:02:10,467 --> 00:02:11,601
Grissom, the defendant

00:02:11,668 --> 00:02:13,570
was found guilty
at his first trial.

00:02:13,637 --> 00:02:15,238
The only reason
we're back in court

00:02:15,305 --> 00:02:17,941
is because his new lawyer
convinced some appellate judge

00:02:18,008 --> 00:02:20,043
the original jury instructions
were faulty.

00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,312
This has nothing to do
with the evidence.

00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:23,313
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,715
There's a fingerprint
on this matchbook.

00:02:25,782 --> 00:02:27,817
So?

00:02:27,884 --> 00:02:30,754
I don't remember it.

00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,190
It's not in my notes.

00:02:33,256 --> 00:02:34,558
The evidence seal isn't broken.

00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:36,826
If the print's there now,
it was there before.

00:02:36,893 --> 00:02:39,896
GRISSOM:
The defendant's fingerprints
are all loop patterns.

00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,335
This is an arch.

00:02:45,402 --> 00:02:47,304
It's not a match.

00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,439
This is not
the defendant's print.

00:02:49,506 --> 00:02:51,908
Are you sure?

00:02:57,547 --> 00:02:59,416
You know, when the
defense hears about this,

00:02:59,482 --> 00:03:02,385
they are going to call
every other piece of
evidence into question.

00:03:02,452 --> 00:03:05,155
I don't need to tell you
what that means.

00:03:06,656 --> 00:03:09,159
I've given them
reasonable doubt.

Heard we have a problem.

The Middle East
has a problem.

00:03:48,411 --> 00:03:51,014
You missed a fingerprint
on a key piece of evidence.

00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,183
I'm trying to keep
an open mind.

00:03:53,249 --> 00:03:54,684
Then how do you
explain it?

00:03:54,751 --> 00:03:55,952
At the moment, I can't.

00:03:56,019 --> 00:03:57,954
Could someone have substituted
a different matchbook?

00:03:58,021 --> 00:04:00,390
Well, the evidence seal
wasn't broken.

00:04:00,456 --> 00:04:01,524
The matchbook's
appearance

00:04:01,591 --> 00:04:03,459
is consistent with
the crime scene photos.

00:04:03,526 --> 00:04:04,661
Since your original testimony

00:04:04,727 --> 00:04:06,429
differs from the actual
physical evidence,

00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:07,630
I thought I'd inform you

00:04:07,697 --> 00:04:09,199
I've opened
a supervisory inquiry.

00:04:10,767 --> 00:04:13,203
Well, that's good,
Conrad.

00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:15,104
You know, I can't recall
a lab director

00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:16,206
as expeditious
as you.

00:04:16,272 --> 00:04:17,807
( <i>gunshot, glass shatters</i> )

00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,445
You okay, Bobby?

00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:23,446
Been better.

00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:24,614
What the hell
happened?

00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,249
I was about to test-fire
the Mac-10

00:04:26,316 --> 00:04:27,750
when it accidentally
discharged.

00:04:27,817 --> 00:04:29,752
Don't know how it happened.

00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:32,088
Should've been more careful.

00:04:32,155 --> 00:04:34,090
Whose, uh,
whose case you working?

00:04:34,157 --> 00:04:35,658
Uh...

00:04:36,926 --> 00:04:38,261
Sara Sidle and Greg Sanders.

00:04:38,328 --> 00:04:40,196
Gun was found

00:04:40,263 --> 00:04:42,532
next to a dead body
at an off-Strip parking lot.

00:04:42,599 --> 00:04:44,400
All right.
Make sure you file a report.

00:04:44,467 --> 00:04:45,468
Yes, sir.

00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:46,836
Everybody back
to work.

00:04:48,104 --> 00:04:49,772
Just keep me posted.

00:04:52,141 --> 00:04:53,443
WILLOWS:
I remember this case.

00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,878
The Garbetts
owned a restaurant

00:04:54,944 --> 00:04:57,247
that was next door to the
victim's hardware store.

00:04:57,313 --> 00:05:00,150
Max Larson owned
the private alleyway

00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:02,385
that was behind
both places.

00:05:02,452 --> 00:05:03,419
STOKES:
<i>That's right.</i>

00:05:03,486 --> 00:05:05,121
<i>He blocked the alleyway</i>
<i>with a Dumpster.</i>

00:05:11,427 --> 00:05:13,129
Yeah, the guy was a jerk.

00:05:13,196 --> 00:05:14,697
Well, he claimed the
restaurant's delivery trucks

00:05:14,764 --> 00:05:15,732
were clogging the alley.

00:05:15,798 --> 00:05:16,933
BROWN:
Didn't the Garbetts sue

00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,201
to have the Dumpster removed?

00:05:18,268 --> 00:05:19,736
GRISSOM:
They lost.

00:05:19,802 --> 00:05:21,304
There was no easement
in their title.

00:05:21,371 --> 00:05:22,572
WILLOWS:
And without access

00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:23,907
for deliveries,

00:05:23,973 --> 00:05:25,208
the restaurant business
just dried up.

00:05:25,275 --> 00:05:26,709
GRISSOM:
All the physical evidence

00:05:26,776 --> 00:05:28,077
pointed to Garbett.

00:05:28,144 --> 00:05:30,313
And according to the victim's
business partner,

00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,248
Garbett had an argument
with the victim

00:05:32,315 --> 00:05:33,616
the day before the murder.

00:05:33,683 --> 00:05:36,920
Garbett's appeal didn't call
the forensics into question.

00:05:36,986 --> 00:05:38,121
Why are we here?

00:05:38,188 --> 00:05:39,789
I'm calling the forensics
into question.

00:05:40,957 --> 00:05:42,292
I printed
this matchbook.

00:05:42,358 --> 00:05:43,960
There was no print.

00:05:44,027 --> 00:05:46,129
Take a look at it now.

00:05:49,532 --> 00:05:50,767
WILLOWS:
Well, the fingerprint's

00:05:50,834 --> 00:05:53,369
pink-- so you used Ninhydrin?

00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:54,337
Mm-hmm.

00:05:56,005 --> 00:05:58,007
Well, I know that
on some surfaces,

00:05:58,074 --> 00:05:59,909
Ninhydrin can take time
to develop a print.

00:05:59,976 --> 00:06:01,678
It was in, uh,

00:06:01,744 --> 00:06:03,479
last May's <i>Journal</i>
<i>of Forensic Sciences.</i>

00:06:03,546 --> 00:06:04,747
I remember the article.

00:06:04,814 --> 00:06:08,017
But I can't remember whether
the variables in the test case

00:06:08,084 --> 00:06:09,419
are consistent with ours.

00:06:09,486 --> 00:06:12,121
Well, if the print matches
the suspect, who cares?

00:06:12,188 --> 00:06:13,756
It doesn't match.

00:06:14,824 --> 00:06:16,493
So, you and Warrick

00:06:16,559 --> 00:06:18,261
take over the file--
make sure all of the other

00:06:18,328 --> 00:06:20,330
evidence is beyond reproach.
Catherine, you supervise.

00:06:20,396 --> 00:06:21,965
To avoid
any appearance

00:06:22,031 --> 00:06:25,034
of impropriety,
I'm going to be hands off.

00:06:28,404 --> 00:06:30,607
( <i>knock on door</i> )

00:06:30,673 --> 00:06:31,708

00:06:31,774 --> 00:06:35,011
You do know that the <i>Journal's</i>

00:06:35,078 --> 00:06:37,013
back issues
are available on-line.

00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,782
The lab has a password.

00:06:39,849 --> 00:06:41,184
When you read from
a computer screen,

00:06:41,251 --> 00:06:42,252
you have to lean in.

00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:43,286
I like to lean back.

00:06:43,353 --> 00:06:45,255
Therefore, I prefer
a hard copy.

00:06:48,091 --> 00:06:49,959
Is this
what your looking for?

00:06:54,931 --> 00:06:56,132
GRISSOM:
May.

00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:58,801
Yes. Thank you.

00:07:00,103 --> 00:07:03,573
News travels so fast
around here.

00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,075

Look, in case
you're not up-to-date

00:07:10,113 --> 00:07:12,015
on your QA/QC memos,

00:07:12,081 --> 00:07:14,150
I've been the lab's
quality control officer

00:07:14,217 --> 00:07:15,218
for the past year.

00:07:15,285 --> 00:07:17,520
Congratulations.

00:07:17,587 --> 00:07:19,389
That job requires

00:07:19,455 --> 00:07:21,558
a detail-oriented person.

00:07:21,624 --> 00:07:22,592
Grissom,

00:07:22,659 --> 00:07:24,961
I've been assigned
to your inquiry.

00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:27,397
I just wanted
to give you the heads-up.

00:07:27,463 --> 00:07:28,998
I'll be impartial.

00:07:29,065 --> 00:07:31,467
I'd expect nothing less.

<i>Margaritaville?</i>

00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:43,179
That is still
the lab's password, right?

00:07:50,253 --> 00:07:51,588
Warrick,
in your field report,

00:07:51,654 --> 00:07:52,956
you documented
the collection

00:07:53,022 --> 00:07:54,390
of several hairs
near the body,

00:07:54,457 --> 00:07:55,725
but DNA
never analyzed them.

00:07:55,792 --> 00:07:56,793
Well, the DA

00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,094
had sufficient evidence

00:07:58,161 --> 00:08:00,763
and filed charges before
I could give the hair to Greg,

00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,365
so I moved on
to another case.

00:08:02,432 --> 00:08:03,366
Process the hairs now.

00:08:03,433 --> 00:08:04,734
Yeah.

00:08:04,801 --> 00:08:05,969
Catherine, do you remember

00:08:06,035 --> 00:08:07,871
why you were late
to this crime scene?

00:08:09,272 --> 00:08:10,073
Eddie had a gig

00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:11,474
and you couldn't find

00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:12,475
a baby-sitter.

00:08:12,542 --> 00:08:14,477
Actually, I kind of
made that up.

00:08:14,544 --> 00:08:15,979
Eddie did have a gig.

00:08:16,045 --> 00:08:19,249
It ended early and he and I...

00:08:20,617 --> 00:08:22,619
Well, let's just say
that not all my memories of him

00:08:22,685 --> 00:08:23,620
are bad ones.

00:08:23,686 --> 00:08:24,921
Which reminds me

00:08:24,988 --> 00:08:26,356
you, at the time,

00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:30,493
were going out with
that assistant manager
of the Flamingo.

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,128
Oh, Susan.

00:08:32,195 --> 00:08:33,296
Boy, did she have it
bad for you.

00:08:33,363 --> 00:08:34,931
She kept calling
while we were working the scene.

00:08:34,998 --> 00:08:36,132
You had to shut your phone off.

00:08:36,199 --> 00:08:38,168
Yeah, well, now she's VP
of Food Services,

00:08:38,234 --> 00:08:40,603
so I get free steak and eggs
every Sunday morning.

00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:42,105
Free steak and eggs
means she didn't know

00:08:42,172 --> 00:08:43,173
about the flight attendant.

00:08:43,239 --> 00:08:45,175
Does everyone know
my business around here?

00:08:45,241 --> 00:08:48,945
WILLOWS:
Okay, Nicky, since you have
such a good memory,

00:08:49,012 --> 00:08:51,447
why don't you explain
the unidentified prints

00:08:51,514 --> 00:08:53,583
that you lifted
from the murder weapon.

00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:54,784
I lifted

00:08:54,851 --> 00:08:56,085
six prints off the wrench.

00:08:56,152 --> 00:08:57,320
I ran them through I-AFIS.

00:08:57,387 --> 00:08:58,922
Five were a match
to the suspect.

00:08:58,988 --> 00:09:00,290
One was unidentified.

00:09:00,356 --> 00:09:01,424
Now, at the time,

00:09:01,491 --> 00:09:04,460
we all agreed
that that print was irrelevant,

00:09:04,527 --> 00:09:06,796
because the wrench was found
in the common area.

00:09:06,863 --> 00:09:08,331
Okay, well, we're going
to have to compare

00:09:08,398 --> 00:09:10,266
that unidentified print
with this matchbook print.

00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:12,602
Will do.

00:09:13,703 --> 00:09:14,571
Hey, Catherine...

00:09:15,872 --> 00:09:17,540
...we didn't do anything wrong
here.

00:09:17,607 --> 00:09:19,108
I agree.

00:09:19,175 --> 00:09:21,778
But the prosecution
may not see it that way.

00:09:26,449 --> 00:09:27,784
Hey, how's Bobby doing?

00:09:27,851 --> 00:09:29,352
Shaken, but working hard.

00:09:29,419 --> 00:09:31,154
Trying to figure out
why the gun discharged.

00:09:31,221 --> 00:09:33,656
ROBBINS:
Well, fortunately,
Bobby dodged his bullet--

00:09:33,723 --> 00:09:34,824
unlike our victim.

00:09:34,891 --> 00:09:36,226
C.O.D's a single gunshot wound

00:09:36,292 --> 00:09:38,428
to the leg.

00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,029
And it severed
the femoral artery.

00:09:40,096 --> 00:09:41,297
We processed
the guy's jeans.

00:09:41,364 --> 00:09:43,233
Tight GSR pattern
around the entrance hole.

00:09:43,299 --> 00:09:44,334
SIDLE:
So, he was either shot

00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,503
by someone at close range
who left the gun behind,

00:09:46,569 --> 00:09:47,837
or it was self-inflicted.

00:09:47,904 --> 00:09:50,039
Why would the shooter
leave the gun behind?

00:09:50,106 --> 00:09:51,174
He probably wouldn't.

00:09:51,241 --> 00:09:52,542
ROBBINS:
And most suicides

00:09:52,609 --> 00:09:54,444
are through the torso
or through the head.

00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:56,412
So if it wasn't intentional...

00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,881
It was accidental.

00:09:57,947 --> 00:09:59,682

Trajectory is up

self-inflicted, accidental

in a toolbox

00:11:08,685 --> 00:11:11,087

00:11:11,154 --> 00:11:13,389

He has sacrificed

Moved back to Vegas,

00:12:43,046 --> 00:12:44,848
poured all his money
into the appeal.

00:12:44,914 --> 00:12:47,183
So you weren't living in town
at the time of the murder?

No, I was living in L.A.

00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:23,175
Vic never even
pulled the trigger.

00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:25,244
Did you get an I.D.
off the serial number?

00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,279
It's also ground down.

00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:29,415
Nearly halfway
through the metal.

00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:31,517
Well, I love a challenge.

00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:34,386
Well, it's all yours.

00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:35,888
STOKES:
The Garbetts' restaurant

00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:38,891
employed six waiters,
two cooks, and a busboy.

00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:40,893
All of whom would've
had access to the kitchen

00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:42,461
and to the wrench.

00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:45,764
Right: Garbett's ex-wife,
three of the waiters

00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:48,434
and both cooks prints
were in I-AFIS because
of work cards,

00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,436
but none was a match
to the mystery print.

00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:51,804
And what about
the other four?

00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,839
I ran their socials
to get their addresses.

00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,508
I'll grab a uniform,
go bang on some doors.

00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:07,886
Hi.

00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:08,954
I'm Nick Stokes.

00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:11,123
Good day, sir.
My name's Nick Stokes.

00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,058
I'm with the
Las Vegas Crime Lab.

00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:16,295
I'm reinvestigating
Max Larson's homicide.

00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:19,198
I was hoping to get
your, uh, your fingerprints.

00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,700
It would help eliminate you
as a suspect.

00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:30,609
Thank you, ma'am.

00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:32,811
Max didn't like dogs.

00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:34,747
We don't allow them
in the store.

00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:36,315
How about you, Mr. Reeba.
Do you down a dog?

00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:39,585
No.

00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:41,253
Mr. Brown, what's this about?

00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,689
I'm sorry, I'm not at liberty
to discuss ongoing cases.

00:18:43,756 --> 00:18:45,691
Look, I have a right to know.

00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:47,192
Max was my business partner.

00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:48,727
Well, all I can tell you

00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:49,928
is that the defendant
was granted

00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:51,396
a new trial.

00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,966
Based on a friggin'
technicality.

00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:56,201
I talked
to the D.A. myself.

00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:58,604
The crime lab
is reviewing the
case file now.

00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,839
Garbett killed Max.

00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:03,308
I was right here when he tried
to shake us down.

00:19:05,411 --> 00:19:07,179
If you don't move that
Dumpster, I swear,
I'm gonna kill you!

00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:09,248
Judge says I'm in the right.
You can go to hell.

00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:10,749
You're gonna regret this.

00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,718
So tell me: how many customers
did you have tonight?

00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:14,887
Hey, Rick...

00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:16,989
what's a number less than one?

00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:18,390
This isn't over.

00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:20,392
I guess he could've
handled it better.

00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:21,827
But Garbett's delivery trucks--

00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:24,263
they were always blocking access
to our parking lot.

00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:27,099
We complained-- he refused
to do anything about it,

00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,967
so we exercised
our legal rights.

00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:30,702
A judge rules
in our favor.

00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:33,505
Two days later, Max is murdered.

00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:35,974
Can you imagine killing
over an incident like this?

00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,709
I've seen people kill
for a lot less, sir.

00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:40,479
Mr. Reeba,

00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:43,882
you and your partner were joint
owners of this property, right?

00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:45,551
Yes.

00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:46,518
With right of survivorship.

00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:48,554
Correct.
And when he died,

00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:51,190
you got it all,
isn't that right?

00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:54,093
What are you getting at?

00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:56,762
Nothing.
It's just a question.

00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:11,977
( <i>machine beeping</i> )

00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,585
Hi.
Hi.

00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:22,454
Video Spectral Analysis.

00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:25,057
I want to see if I can
bring out the image
on the matchbook.

00:20:25,124 --> 00:20:27,493
STOKES:
We didn't have this equipment
five years ago.

00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:30,162
That's why
I'm doing it now.

00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,398
How was the door-to-door?

00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:35,000
STOKES:
Good exercise.

00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:39,371
Everyone volunteered their
prints but... no match.

00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,976
Warrick, just the
guy I wanted to see.

00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:45,277
Ecklie, you know
I'm real busy...

00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:47,346
Ah, it won't take long.
My office.

00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:54,119
Uh... I'll cut to the chase.

00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:55,988
Did Supervisor Grissom

00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:57,756
instruct you
to analyze the hairs

00:20:57,823 --> 00:20:59,525
you found
near Max Larson's body?

00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,393
It was my job
to bring the hairs to DNA.

00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,061
Did you?
Yes.

00:21:03,128 --> 00:21:05,097
Five years ago.
No, yesterday.

00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:08,467
Look, if there
was a problem...

00:21:08,534 --> 00:21:09,468
Have a seat.

00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:15,207
In my capacity
as Assistant Director,

00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,276
I'm now privy
to personnel files.

00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:19,311
Um...

00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:23,048
You've done outstanding work
over the years, Warrick. Truly.

00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,584
I see commendations
from detectives

00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:28,253
and D.A.'s...

00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,823
I also see
you have a gambling problem.

00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:33,759
I <i>had</i> a gambling problem.

00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,495
What's your point?

00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:40,199
Well, it appears
Supervisor Grissom

00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:42,067
counseled you appropriately.

00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,001
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:44,036
That's correct.

00:21:44,103 --> 00:21:45,404
So...

00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:47,639
he gave you access to
departmental resources

00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:49,742
to help you deal
with the problem?

00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,009
No...

00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:53,846
he helped me, uh...

00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:55,414
by being a friend.

00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:57,883
Good.

00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:02,988
You've been a big help.

00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:04,757
Thanks.

00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:08,794
Hey.

00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:20,873
This is, uh, confidential.

00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:22,841
I don't have an office, so...

00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:24,943
The inquiry into Grissom.

00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,845
Just reviewing
all documentation.

00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:29,081
Case identifiers,
analysts' initials...

00:22:29,148 --> 00:22:30,015
Your responsibility

00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:31,917
is to confirm
that all conclusions drawn

00:22:31,984 --> 00:22:33,285
are supported by the data.

00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,653
They are.

00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,821
Excuse me?

00:22:35,888 --> 00:22:36,722
I worked on this case.

00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:39,658
The conclusions,
they are supported.

00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:41,226
I assume that's
what you're finding?

00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:43,796
Catherine...

00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:46,465
I appreciate your interest,
but I think it's prudent

00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:49,535
to reserve my findings
for the Assistant Director.

00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:53,705
Right.

00:23:00,917 --> 00:23:03,333
Neil, you got a minute?

00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:05,202
I don't think I have any work pending
for you.

00:23:05,269 --> 00:23:06,536
I need your expertise.

00:23:06,603 --> 00:23:07,571
Matchbook print.

00:23:07,638 --> 00:23:09,573
Everybody's
talking about it.

00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,607
Well, good.

00:23:10,674 --> 00:23:13,243
Scientific discoveries arise
through discourse.

00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,244
Now...

00:23:14,311 --> 00:23:15,746
Ninhydrin works by reacting

00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:17,347
to one end of a protein chain

00:23:17,414 --> 00:23:18,882
to form Ruhemann's purple...

00:23:18,949 --> 00:23:20,717
Which makes
fingerprints visible.

00:23:20,784 --> 00:23:21,752
Protein chains

00:23:21,818 --> 00:23:23,854
are made up of a series
of amino acids,

00:23:23,921 --> 00:23:25,656
sometimes a hundred units long.

00:23:25,722 --> 00:23:28,191
But only one end of the
chain has the H-N-H...
The N-terminus.

00:23:28,258 --> 00:23:29,192
It's the only part

00:23:29,259 --> 00:23:30,427
<i>of the protein molecule</i>

00:23:30,494 --> 00:23:32,095
<i>that interacts with Ninhydrin.</i>

00:23:32,162 --> 00:23:35,532
But fingerprints are subjected
to bacterial degradation,

00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:37,501
which causes the proteins
to break down

00:23:37,568 --> 00:23:38,635
into smaller amino acids.

00:23:38,702 --> 00:23:40,604
Upping the number of N-termini.
And making

00:23:40,671 --> 00:23:42,439
the fingerprint more visible.

00:23:42,506 --> 00:23:45,642
But because new fingerprints
are sometimes composed

00:23:45,709 --> 00:23:47,244
of fully intact proteins,

00:23:47,311 --> 00:23:48,912
you could spray Ninhydrin,

00:23:48,979 --> 00:23:51,215
and not see a result
for months, yes?

00:23:51,281 --> 00:23:52,316
Or in rare cases,

00:23:52,382 --> 00:23:54,785
years-- depending on
the rate of degradation.

00:23:54,851 --> 00:23:58,155
My matchbook print was
inside a plastic evidence bag.

00:23:58,222 --> 00:23:59,923
That could affect the rate.

00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:00,991
Let's see...

00:24:01,058 --> 00:24:02,659
plastic...

00:24:02,726 --> 00:24:05,128
plastic traps in heat
and humidity.

00:24:05,195 --> 00:24:09,233
<i>Bacteria would continue</i>
<i>to break down over time.</i>

00:24:12,369 --> 00:24:16,273
So theoretically, the bag was
acting as a humidifying chamber.

00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:18,508
I'd say you were processing
a print in slow motion.

00:24:20,277 --> 00:24:22,412
Thank you, Neil.

00:24:22,479 --> 00:24:23,447
I'm confused.

00:24:23,513 --> 00:24:25,749
Do we think the dead guy
bought a defective gun,

00:24:25,816 --> 00:24:27,951
or was he selling a gun
he'd already modified?

00:24:28,018 --> 00:24:29,753
Maybe he modified it
for his own use.

00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:31,121
If that was the case,

00:24:31,188 --> 00:24:33,323
then why would he need to file
down the serial numbers?

00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:34,958
Good point.

00:24:35,025 --> 00:24:37,861
Okay, so you take
the polishing compound,

00:24:37,928 --> 00:24:42,299
and you rub it on the
obliterated serial number.

00:24:42,366 --> 00:24:44,268
And then you hit the spot

00:24:44,334 --> 00:24:47,471
with the wheel
until it's mirror smooth.

00:24:57,714 --> 00:25:00,684
Fry's Reagent.

00:25:00,751 --> 00:25:04,187
It differentially eats away
at the compressed area.

00:25:04,254 --> 00:25:07,658
SANDERS:
To expose the denser metal
of the serial number.

00:25:10,961 --> 00:25:12,930
Take a look.

00:25:14,598 --> 00:25:17,467
SANDERS:
Pop goes the serial number!

00:25:17,534 --> 00:25:19,670
Run it through NCIC
and local pawn shops.

00:25:19,736 --> 00:25:21,338
See if we can get an address.

00:25:22,806 --> 00:25:24,841
All right.

00:25:24,908 --> 00:25:26,877
ECKLIE:
How you doing, Greg?

00:25:26,944 --> 00:25:28,712
Excuse me.

00:25:28,779 --> 00:25:30,147
Sara.

00:25:30,213 --> 00:25:32,149
You got a minute?

00:25:32,216 --> 00:25:33,250
I guess.

00:25:33,317 --> 00:25:35,152
Flitz's Compound.

00:25:35,219 --> 00:25:37,955
I'm sure you're not polishing
your jewelry in the lab.

00:25:38,021 --> 00:25:39,456
That would be unauthorized.

00:25:40,958 --> 00:25:42,125
What can I do for you?

00:25:42,192 --> 00:25:43,427
As you know,
it's my job

00:25:43,493 --> 00:25:44,695
to review everyone's file.

00:25:44,761 --> 00:25:45,862
I just want to make sure

00:25:45,929 --> 00:25:47,864
you finished up with
your PEAP counselor.

00:25:47,931 --> 00:25:49,499
That's none of your business,
Ecklie.

00:25:49,566 --> 00:25:51,235
Well, not only
is it my business,

00:25:51,301 --> 00:25:53,403
but I plan to speak
with your supervisor.

00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:54,705
About what?

00:25:54,771 --> 00:25:56,106
You have updated him, right?

00:25:56,173 --> 00:25:59,409
Yeah, yeah, we've had an
abbreviated conversation.

00:25:59,476 --> 00:26:00,744
I'm doing fine.

00:26:00,811 --> 00:26:04,147
I completed my required number
of sessions months ago.

00:26:04,214 --> 00:26:08,151
Huh. Grissom failed to note that
conversation in your file.

00:26:08,218 --> 00:26:09,987
Um...

00:26:10,053 --> 00:26:13,423
But I'll take care of it.

00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:14,758
All right.

00:26:14,825 --> 00:26:17,427
Thanks.

00:26:21,865 --> 00:26:26,937
Expose the matchbook to white,
and that covers the spectrum.

00:26:27,004 --> 00:26:29,473
I'll bring out
the illuminants

00:26:29,539 --> 00:26:30,941
and contrast.

00:26:31,008 --> 00:26:32,776
Rotate it 180.

00:26:37,147 --> 00:26:40,183
"Club PCH."

00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:41,218
"Los Angeles."

00:26:41,285 --> 00:26:42,986
Is that probative?

00:26:43,053 --> 00:26:45,889
Maybe.

00:26:45,956 --> 00:26:48,392
Defendant's son lived in L.A.

00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:53,597
So I did a background check
on Keith Garbett.

00:26:53,664 --> 00:26:54,965
He has no record.

00:26:55,032 --> 00:26:58,435
Moved to California
two years before the murder.

00:26:58,502 --> 00:27:01,471
He opened a veterinary practice
in Encino.

00:27:01,538 --> 00:27:03,073
He was a veterinarian?

00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,808
Didn't I just say that?

00:27:04,875 --> 00:27:06,710
We found some dog hairs
at the crime scene.

00:27:06,777 --> 00:27:08,812
Out of context,
it didn't really
mean anything.

00:27:08,879 --> 00:27:10,314
Well, now it does.

00:27:14,585 --> 00:27:16,587
Mr. Stokes.

00:27:16,653 --> 00:27:17,721
Keith.

00:27:17,788 --> 00:27:19,923
Well, tell me you've
got some good news.

00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:22,359
Dad's lawyer says the
case could get tossed.

00:27:22,426 --> 00:27:24,061
I'm Detective Jim Brass,
Las Vegas Police.

00:27:24,127 --> 00:27:25,729
We'd like to ask you
a couple questions.

00:27:25,796 --> 00:27:27,297
Sure.

00:27:27,364 --> 00:27:28,565
You ever been to Club PCH?

00:27:28,632 --> 00:27:30,601
I did some clubbing in my 20's.

00:27:30,667 --> 00:27:33,837
What does this have to do
with the investigation?

00:27:33,904 --> 00:27:36,340
Keith, what we'd really like
to go ahead and do

00:27:36,406 --> 00:27:38,175
is get a set
of your fingerprints,

00:27:38,242 --> 00:27:39,276
if we could. Okay?

00:27:39,343 --> 00:27:40,510
Why?

00:27:40,577 --> 00:27:43,480
You know, I'm sorry, but
I don't exactly trust you guys.

00:27:43,547 --> 00:27:44,781
You destroyed my family.

00:27:44,848 --> 00:27:47,017
You let my dad rot in jail
for five years,

00:27:47,084 --> 00:27:48,719
and now you're coming after me?

00:27:48,785 --> 00:27:50,087
No way. Forget it.

00:27:52,289 --> 00:27:55,492
I thought that went well.

00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:58,729
There's more than one way
to get his prints.

00:27:58,795 --> 00:28:01,932
Trash on the curb--
public property, right?

00:28:01,999 --> 00:28:03,600
Don't need a warrant.

00:28:11,125 --> 00:28:12,960
This conversation is
on the record.

00:28:13,027 --> 00:28:15,997
Part of the official inquiry
into the Max Larson case.

00:28:16,063 --> 00:28:16,998
Understood.

00:28:17,064 --> 00:28:18,032
Five years ago,

00:28:18,099 --> 00:28:19,600
were you part of a team

00:28:19,667 --> 00:28:21,202
that processed a homicide

00:28:21,269 --> 00:28:22,737
at 2028 Boulder Highway?

00:28:22,803 --> 00:28:24,005
You know I was.

00:28:25,973 --> 00:28:27,642
Specifically, what tasks

00:28:27,708 --> 00:28:30,845
did Supervisor Grissom
assign to you?

00:28:30,912 --> 00:28:32,046
Gil doesn't micromanage.

00:28:32,113 --> 00:28:33,781
We all know
what needs to be done.

00:28:35,416 --> 00:28:36,984
I photo-documented the scene,

00:28:37,051 --> 00:28:38,553
I collected blood evidence,

00:28:38,619 --> 00:28:40,188
and I brought the charred

00:28:40,254 --> 00:28:42,056
newspaper to Trace.

00:28:42,123 --> 00:28:43,191
In the analysis phase,

00:28:43,257 --> 00:28:45,259
did Grissom review
your reports with you?

00:28:45,326 --> 00:28:48,095
Are you asking if he performed
a supervisory review?

00:28:48,162 --> 00:28:50,331
It's policy.

00:28:50,398 --> 00:28:51,766
He must have.

00:28:51,833 --> 00:28:53,568
I'm sure he did.

00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:59,440
Are you doing all this
for the sake of the lab

00:28:59,507 --> 00:29:02,743
or to indict Grissom?

00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:04,345
Catherine,

00:29:04,412 --> 00:29:06,614
there are a number

00:29:06,681 --> 00:29:08,716
of talented CSIs, like yourself,

00:29:08,783 --> 00:29:10,852
who have put in
to be supervisors.

00:29:10,918 --> 00:29:13,487
I just want to make sure
the right people

00:29:13,554 --> 00:29:15,056
are in the right place.

00:29:18,192 --> 00:29:19,961
About my request--

00:29:20,995 --> 00:29:22,697
I really would

00:29:22,763 --> 00:29:24,765
like to supervise days.

00:29:24,832 --> 00:29:27,768
Right. You're a single mother.
Better hours.

00:29:27,835 --> 00:29:30,471
And I bet you could use
the extra cash.

00:29:30,538 --> 00:29:32,139
No, this promotion isn't
about money.

00:29:32,206 --> 00:29:34,642
Must be nice to be
independently wealthy.

00:29:39,013 --> 00:29:40,414
We're done here, right?

00:29:43,751 --> 00:29:45,586
Yeah.

00:30:15,316 --> 00:30:17,051
Vacuum metal deposition.

00:30:17,118 --> 00:30:21,789
Sometimes the evidence isn't
in the bag... it's on it.

00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:25,426
( <i>hissing</i> )

00:30:44,979 --> 00:30:47,415
WILLOWS:
Comparing unknown
matchbook print

00:30:47,481 --> 00:30:49,217
to garbage bag print.

00:30:55,022 --> 00:30:57,358
Game, set...

00:30:57,425 --> 00:30:58,960
Match.

00:30:59,026 --> 00:31:00,027
We're closed.

00:31:02,029 --> 00:31:04,365
Hey, did you hear me?
I said we're closed.

00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,535
Hey... Hey!

00:31:20,181 --> 00:31:22,884
It wasn't my restaurant.

00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:25,353
It wasn't my problem.

00:31:25,419 --> 00:31:26,387
You lied to us.

00:31:26,454 --> 00:31:28,656
Said you were living in L.A.

00:31:28,723 --> 00:31:29,824
at the time
of the murder.

00:31:29,891 --> 00:31:31,859
WILLOWS:
But while your parents
were in court,

00:31:31,926 --> 00:31:33,694
suing to have
that Dumpster removed,

00:31:33,761 --> 00:31:35,296
you were running
the restaurant.

00:31:35,363 --> 00:31:37,798
In fact, you signed
the vendor checks that week.

00:31:37,865 --> 00:31:39,667
STOKES:
They were in a box
of records

00:31:39,734 --> 00:31:41,169
your mother sent over.

00:31:41,235 --> 00:31:43,004
You saw the business
was going under.

00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,572
Their marriage
was in trouble.

00:31:44,639 --> 00:31:47,341
And when the judge ruled
against them, you snapped.

00:31:48,576 --> 00:31:50,011
The evidence is
circumstantial at best.

00:31:50,077 --> 00:31:51,345
WILLOWS:
You can play it
that way.

00:31:51,412 --> 00:31:52,346
It's fine with us.

00:31:52,413 --> 00:31:54,315
You and your father
can both stand trial.

00:31:54,382 --> 00:31:56,751
I mean, after all, he was
the one who had motive.

00:31:56,817 --> 00:31:57,785
He threatened Larson.

00:31:57,852 --> 00:31:59,587
His prints were on the wrench.

00:31:59,654 --> 00:32:02,156
You think the D.A. is
going to try two people
for the same crime?

00:32:02,223 --> 00:32:03,157
STOKES:
Oh, yes, ma'am.

00:32:03,224 --> 00:32:04,158
At minimum,

00:32:04,225 --> 00:32:06,027
they're looking
at conspiracy.

00:32:06,093 --> 00:32:08,763
WILLOWS:
As far as we know, they could've
been in it together.

00:32:08,829 --> 00:32:11,499
It's easier to overpower a guy
when it's two against one.

00:32:11,566 --> 00:32:14,168
Yeah, but I don't think
it went down that way.

00:32:14,235 --> 00:32:15,770
After your father
was convicted,

00:32:15,837 --> 00:32:17,839
you gave up on your
veterinary practice.

00:32:17,905 --> 00:32:19,407
Moved back to Vegas--

00:32:19,473 --> 00:32:22,677
spent every last dime you had
on his defense.

00:32:22,743 --> 00:32:24,879
Now, that tells me you had

00:32:24,946 --> 00:32:25,880
a guilty conscience.

00:32:25,947 --> 00:32:27,882
It should tell you
that I love my father.

00:32:27,949 --> 00:32:30,084
Your father spent the last
five years in prison, man.

00:32:30,151 --> 00:32:32,353
If you love him so much,
why don't you tell the truth.

00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,821
Set him free.

00:32:42,697 --> 00:32:44,665
My father had nothing
to do with it.

00:32:45,466 --> 00:32:46,534
Keith...

00:32:46,601 --> 00:32:47,869
I never thought that

00:32:47,935 --> 00:32:50,204
they would
convict an innocent man.

00:32:50,271 --> 00:32:51,572
So... I kept quiet.

00:32:54,008 --> 00:32:56,611
To protect yourself.

00:33:03,985 --> 00:33:06,587
ECKLIE:
We'll convene in my office
at the end of your shift.

00:33:06,654 --> 00:33:09,156
Regarding what?
This case is over.

00:33:09,223 --> 00:33:10,324
Don't be late.

00:33:19,959 --> 00:33:21,194
Hey.
Hey.

00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,917
What's going on?
Dispatch said to meet you here.

00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:24,252
Well, three days ago

00:33:24,318 --> 00:33:26,454
we found a John Doe
who was shot to death

00:33:26,521 --> 00:33:28,523
in an abandoned
parking lot off Strip.

00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:29,757
Uh, there was a Mac-10

00:33:29,824 --> 00:33:30,925
near the body.

00:33:30,992 --> 00:33:33,294
Gun is registered
to a Paul Turlock,

00:33:33,361 --> 00:33:35,363
who happens to be
the owner of the house.

00:33:35,429 --> 00:33:36,931
Oh, so you want to see

00:33:36,998 --> 00:33:39,066
if Paul Turlock
and John Doe are
one and the same.

00:33:39,133 --> 00:33:42,803
Yeah.
Okay.

00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:45,806
Odds are looking
pretty good so far.

00:33:51,746 --> 00:33:53,548
Police! Anybody here?

Any of these
look like your guy?

00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:41,462
Guy on the end
with the "Rita" tattoo.

00:34:41,529 --> 00:34:44,165
Think Rita's his mom
or his girlfriend?

If it's not crossed out,
it's definitely his mom.

Five of them.
Serials obliterated.

00:34:55,877 --> 00:34:57,612
Files and grinding stone.

00:34:57,678 --> 00:35:00,314
It's all the tools needed
to convert a semi into an auto

00:35:00,381 --> 00:35:01,682
and then cover your tracks.

Each filed-off

This guy was looking
at ten felonies.

00:35:08,456 --> 00:35:11,692
Actually, he already got
the death penalty.

we, uh, liked what we saw.

Deal's a go.

Five large for five units.

00:35:19,433 --> 00:35:21,402
I'll call youse back

That's tonight.

"We liked what we saw"?

00:35:28,109 --> 00:35:30,178
That tells me that
Paulie's already met

00:35:30,244 --> 00:35:32,046
with the buyers--
probably to show them

00:35:32,113 --> 00:35:33,414
the prototype of the Mac-10.

00:35:33,481 --> 00:35:35,917
Maybe they met at the parking
lot where we found the body.

00:35:36,951 --> 00:35:38,352
You know, most likely

00:35:38,419 --> 00:35:40,988
they'd hook up
at the same location
to complete the sale.

00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:42,523
Buyers don't know he's dead.

00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:44,492
Lucky for us.

00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:58,406
Hell of a job on
the Larson case, Nick.

00:35:58,472 --> 00:35:59,774
If it weren't for you,

00:35:59,841 --> 00:36:01,509
the son would've walked.

00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:03,744
It was a team effort.

00:36:03,811 --> 00:36:05,880
Team effort?

00:36:05,947 --> 00:36:08,316
Just like the Westanson case,
right?

00:36:09,684 --> 00:36:11,219
Last year,
that woman who burned

00:36:11,285 --> 00:36:13,054
to ashes in a barrel
of diesel fuel.

00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:17,191
Yeah. Yeah, I'm familiar
with the case, Conrad.

00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:18,626
I reviewed Grissom's report.

00:36:18,693 --> 00:36:20,261
It seems to me
that you were a...

00:36:20,328 --> 00:36:23,731
one-man CSI machine.

Grissom rejected
Fay Minden's testimony,

00:36:27,301 --> 00:36:29,303
but not you.
No, Grissom
allowed me

00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:32,940
to pursue a new lead,
under his supervision.

00:36:33,007 --> 00:36:37,078
Did he offer you any other CSIs
as support staff?

00:36:38,146 --> 00:36:40,448
D-Don't worry
about it.

00:36:40,515 --> 00:36:42,316
I respect your independence.

00:36:43,484 --> 00:36:47,088
Anyway, good work.

00:36:48,156 --> 00:36:50,491
( <i>door closes</i> )

00:37:17,852 --> 00:37:19,420
( <i>siren wailing</i> )

00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,709
Keep your hands up.

00:37:26,709 --> 00:37:28,077
No sudden moves.

00:37:29,478 --> 00:37:31,347
ATF. I'm an agent.

00:37:31,414 --> 00:37:34,417
Just keep your hands
where I can see 'em,
and you won't get hurt.

00:37:36,585 --> 00:37:40,423
Special Agent John Calder, ATF.

00:37:40,489 --> 00:37:42,024
He's an undercover agent.

00:37:42,091 --> 00:37:43,259
I don't believe this.

00:37:43,326 --> 00:37:46,095
You're involved in a buy
bust for some firearms?

00:37:46,162 --> 00:37:47,263
CALDER:
You boys burned us bad.

00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:48,597
We were gonna make
an arrest tonight.

00:37:48,664 --> 00:37:50,366
SIDLE:
Suspect's name is Paul Turlock?

00:37:50,433 --> 00:37:52,268
Yeah.
Mr. Turlock A.D.'d

00:37:52,335 --> 00:37:54,270
a Mac into his femoral artery.

00:37:54,337 --> 00:37:56,472
You guys are four days too late.

00:37:56,539 --> 00:37:58,174
Wrap it up, boys,
let's go home.

00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,942
<i>If I understand you correctly,</i>

00:38:00,009 --> 00:38:03,412
the latent fingerprint
on the matchbook...

00:38:03,479 --> 00:38:06,882
continued to process <i>itself</i>
<i>after you were finished.</i>

00:38:06,949 --> 00:38:09,452
Theoretically, yes.

00:38:09,518 --> 00:38:11,287
As I know you are aware,

00:38:11,354 --> 00:38:13,522
I've asked Sofia
to review your handling

00:38:13,589 --> 00:38:16,225
of the Max Larson
homicide.

00:38:16,292 --> 00:38:19,528
Did Supervisor Grissom
violate any procedures

00:38:19,595 --> 00:38:21,631
in mishandling the evidence?

00:38:25,001 --> 00:38:27,703
I don't believe
he mishandled anything.

00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:30,906
He followed
laboratory protocol,

00:38:30,973 --> 00:38:32,475
and when he saw
that the evidence

00:38:32,541 --> 00:38:34,677
didn't correspond
to his records, he
notified the D.A.

00:38:34,744 --> 00:38:36,145
and recused himself

00:38:36,212 --> 00:38:37,980
from case review.

00:38:38,047 --> 00:38:40,783
Are you saying that, uh,

00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:44,353
his handling of the discovery
of new evidence

00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:48,991
while on the stand
is within our protocols?

00:38:50,893 --> 00:38:54,297
As it applies to this case, yes.

00:39:03,506 --> 00:39:07,009
In the, uh... in the process
of investigating this case,

00:39:07,076 --> 00:39:09,945
your ability to supervise
has come into question.

00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:15,785
Isn't that a little beyond
the scope of this inquiry?

00:39:15,851 --> 00:39:16,786
Again, we have

00:39:16,852 --> 00:39:18,721
no evidence that
Grissom violated

00:39:18,788 --> 00:39:20,056
any protocols or proc...

00:39:20,122 --> 00:39:21,290
Thank you for your input.

00:39:21,357 --> 00:39:24,527
Okay, Conrad,
what do you got?
Let's hear it.

00:39:24,593 --> 00:39:26,629
Well, taken individually,
there's nothing specific

00:39:26,696 --> 00:39:28,064
that warrants
disciplinary action.

00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:29,098
However,

00:39:29,165 --> 00:39:31,734
my investigation
has led me to question

00:39:31,801 --> 00:39:34,704
the effectiveness of your team

00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:37,306
and your ability to lead it.

00:39:39,275 --> 00:39:41,477
I'm breaking you guys up.

00:39:43,913 --> 00:39:45,414
Excuse me?

00:39:45,481 --> 00:39:47,316
I've already spoken
with the director.

00:39:47,383 --> 00:39:49,285
Staff assignments
are under my purview.

00:39:49,352 --> 00:39:50,820
Effective immediately,

00:39:50,886 --> 00:39:52,855
Catherine Willows
will be promoted

00:39:52,922 --> 00:39:54,623
to swing shift supervisor...

00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:56,292
Wait a minute,
Catherine applied for days.

00:39:56,359 --> 00:39:57,760
I do what's best for the lab.

00:39:58,794 --> 00:39:59,962
I've decided to move

00:40:00,029 --> 00:40:01,597
the swing shift supervisor

00:40:01,664 --> 00:40:03,432
to days...
I've been

00:40:03,499 --> 00:40:04,934
the acting supervisor
of days

00:40:05,001 --> 00:40:08,738
for the past month-- I believe
I've proven myself capable.

00:40:08,804 --> 00:40:11,340
Warrick Brown and Nick Stokes
will report to Catherine.

00:40:11,407 --> 00:40:12,942
Greg Sanders,

00:40:13,009 --> 00:40:16,612
pending his proficiency,
Sara Sidle and Sofia

00:40:16,679 --> 00:40:17,747
will report to you.

00:40:17,813 --> 00:40:18,814
You're demoting me.

00:40:18,881 --> 00:40:19,982
I think
you and Grissom

00:40:20,049 --> 00:40:21,584
suit each other.

00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:26,255
Why are you doing this?

00:40:26,322 --> 00:40:28,057
There's been a chronic lack
of supervision

00:40:28,124 --> 00:40:29,292
on the graveyard shift.

00:40:29,358 --> 00:40:31,294
Your people have been
covering for you, Gil.

00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,763
For your shortcomings.

00:40:33,829 --> 00:40:36,699
Before your mismanagement
jeopardizes this lab,

00:40:36,766 --> 00:40:38,634
I'm rectifying the situation.

00:40:38,701 --> 00:40:40,870
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:40:43,172 --> 00:40:45,975
My decision is final.

00:40:52,709 --> 00:40:55,078
He kind of talked
to all of us.

00:40:55,145 --> 00:40:58,115
It was more like he
ambushed all of us.

00:40:58,182 --> 00:40:59,783
Real sorry, Grissom.

00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:02,186
There's no reason to be.

00:41:02,252 --> 00:41:06,056
Look, Ecklie doesn't
have a scientific
bone in his body.

00:41:06,123 --> 00:41:07,925
He starts with
the answers he wants

00:41:07,991 --> 00:41:10,294
and then devises
the questions to get them.

00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,563
This sucks.

00:41:12,629 --> 00:41:14,865
This guy has been kissing ass
all his life,

00:41:14,932 --> 00:41:17,434
he's trying to tell me--
he's trying to tell <i>us</i>

00:41:17,501 --> 00:41:19,303
what makes a good supervisor.

00:41:19,369 --> 00:41:21,038
What makes a good team?

00:41:21,104 --> 00:41:23,974
Well, if a team gets used
to doing things a certain way

00:41:24,041 --> 00:41:26,677
just because that's the way
they've always done them,

00:41:26,743 --> 00:41:28,946
then they start to lose
their effectiveness.

00:41:29,012 --> 00:41:30,214
Oh, come on.

00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,416
You don't really believe that.

00:41:32,483 --> 00:41:35,252
No. I believe that the longer
a team works together,

00:41:35,319 --> 00:41:36,687
the stronger they become.

00:41:36,753 --> 00:41:38,021
But I'm not in
charge of the lab,

00:41:38,088 --> 00:41:40,157
nor would I want to be.

00:41:41,492 --> 00:41:43,627
I got this--
that's the kind of cash

00:41:43,694 --> 00:41:45,395
I'm bringing down
right now.

00:41:45,462 --> 00:41:47,131
( <i>Brown chuckles</i> )

00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,435
I always knew
there'd come a time

00:41:51,502 --> 00:41:54,171
when we weren't, uh,
working together anymore.

00:41:54,238 --> 00:41:57,207
I just didn't think it'd be
under these circumstances.

00:41:58,809 --> 00:42:00,978
( <i>phone rings</i> )

00:42:05,182 --> 00:42:06,517
Brown.

00:42:07,551 --> 00:42:10,254
Okay. All right.

00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,222
No, I'll tell Nick.

00:42:12,289 --> 00:42:14,158
We'll see you there.

00:42:14,224 --> 00:42:16,326
Uh, congrats, by the way.

00:42:17,961 --> 00:42:19,530
All right.

00:42:19,596 --> 00:42:22,633
My new supervisor.

00:42:22,699 --> 00:42:24,434
Catherine?

00:42:24,501 --> 00:42:26,403
Yeah.

00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:28,806
Good.
Well,

00:42:28,872 --> 00:42:30,674
I got to get some rest.

00:42:30,741 --> 00:42:32,976
Swing shift starts at 4:00
in the afternoon.

00:42:33,043 --> 00:42:34,778
That's a big change.

00:42:34,845 --> 00:42:36,613
Heracleitus once said,

00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:40,050
"It is in changing
that we find purpose."

00:42:40,117 --> 00:42:42,917
Well, thanks to you,

00:42:42,917 --> 00:42:45,083
this job,
I already know my purpose.
