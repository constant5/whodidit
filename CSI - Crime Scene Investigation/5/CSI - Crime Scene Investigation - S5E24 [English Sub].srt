Dirt road is slower

because you can only
roll with one dice,

00:09:49,882 --> 00:09:51,317

because you don't run

that you would find
on the highway, right?

00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,822
But when you are
on the highway, you
get to roll two dice,

00:09:56,889 --> 00:09:57,823
which makes
you go faster.

00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:44,472
One of the guys
sounded Russian,

00:12:44,539 --> 00:12:45,907
like he was wanna-be Mafia.

00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:46,908
Mm-hmm.

00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,510
Fat boy was obviously
his bodyguard.

00:12:48,576 --> 00:12:49,511
Mm-hmm.

00:12:49,577 --> 00:12:50,979
So, uh, you know,

00:12:51,045 --> 00:12:54,315
I wasn't physically
afraid of the guys,

00:12:54,382 --> 00:12:56,918
but something was kind
of sinister about them.

00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:58,520
They were provoking me,

00:12:58,586 --> 00:13:00,655
but they weren't
making a move.

00:13:00,722 --> 00:13:03,591
It was almost like they were
waiting for me to make a move.

00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:04,959
Say if I smacked big-mouth,

00:13:05,026 --> 00:13:07,529
fat boy would've came over
and stabbed me or something.

00:13:07,595 --> 00:13:10,899
Even fat boy was vibing me
not to take the bait.

00:13:10,965 --> 00:13:12,133
So what happened?

00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,702
Well, valet finally
brought Tina's car up.

00:13:14,769 --> 00:13:16,938
So, I maneuver her
around these guys

00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:18,573
and I put her in her car,

00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,609
and I turn my back to them
and let 'em talk this smack.

00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:22,710
I'm calming Tina down.

00:13:22,777 --> 00:13:24,179
Tell her everything is fine.

00:13:24,245 --> 00:13:26,815
She drives off and I walk away.

00:13:26,881 --> 00:13:28,817
I called Tina
later on.

00:13:28,883 --> 00:13:30,318
And I tell her, uh, you know,

00:13:30,385 --> 00:13:32,487
if she got any problem
with me being a cop,

00:13:32,554 --> 00:13:34,889
she needs to get over it,
'cause now I'm packing.

00:13:34,956 --> 00:13:35,890
Yeah. Yeah.

00:13:35,957 --> 00:13:38,159
What'd you do on Sunday?

00:13:38,226 --> 00:13:40,929
Scoured the hotel
looking for these punks.

00:13:40,995 --> 00:13:42,096
( <i>laughs</i> )

00:13:43,431 --> 00:13:45,667
Oh, my two favorite guys.

00:13:45,733 --> 00:13:48,303
So, I've got an assault
at Stripperama

00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,939
and a trash run
at Flamingo and Koval.

00:13:51,005 --> 00:13:53,541
I'm too busy to play favorites,
so duke it out.

00:13:53,608 --> 00:13:55,343
Duke it out.

00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:57,445
Boy better flip a coin.

00:13:57,512 --> 00:13:58,746
I'll hurt you.

00:13:58,813 --> 00:13:59,981
Yeah, you better
flip that coin.

00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:01,015
Call it in the air.

00:14:01,082 --> 00:14:03,384
Heads.

00:14:04,819 --> 00:14:06,988
Have fun at the trash run.

00:14:07,989 --> 00:14:09,591
You know, I'd do
two out of three,

00:14:09,657 --> 00:14:11,125
but you got
a gambling problem.

00:14:11,192 --> 00:14:13,061
No, hey, you know what?

00:14:13,127 --> 00:14:14,095
You keep this.

00:14:14,162 --> 00:14:16,831
It's bad luck.

00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:52,144
( <i>driver's door opens, closes)</i>

00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:53,612
( <i>footsteps approaching</i> )

00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,181
( <i>grunts</i> )

( <i>indistinct</i>
<i>radio transmission</i> )

00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:16,601
Dumpster's clean.

00:15:16,668 --> 00:15:19,037
No apparent blood
or body parts.

00:15:19,104 --> 00:15:20,872
Take a look at this.

00:15:20,939 --> 00:15:23,375
This seems
contrived to me.

00:15:23,441 --> 00:15:25,443
The blood pool
is too perfect.

00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,878
There's no splatter.

00:15:26,945 --> 00:15:29,014
Like somebody placed
these entrails.

00:15:31,709 --> 00:15:32,677
A lure.

00:15:32,744 --> 00:15:34,746
To grab Nick.

00:15:35,667 --> 00:15:37,902
David, get this stuff
to the doc.

00:15:37,969 --> 00:15:40,333
Look, I'm... I'm really sorry
I didn't get here sooner.

00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:42,001
Maybe if I had...

00:15:42,068 --> 00:15:43,403
We're going to get
him back, David.

00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:45,405
Gil, Catherine.

00:15:45,472 --> 00:15:47,640
I want you to know,
as far as I'm concerned,

00:15:47,707 --> 00:15:49,275
lab's only got
one case tonight.

00:15:49,342 --> 00:15:50,744
Same for the rest
of the department.

00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:52,245
Thanks, Conrad.

00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:59,667
Hey. What do you need me to do?

00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,703
( <i>barking</i> )

00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:23,110
They've lost the scent.

00:16:23,177 --> 00:16:25,245
Might be as far
as it goes.

00:16:26,346 --> 00:16:29,216
Yeah, there was some sort
of large vehicle here.

00:17:08,917 --> 00:17:10,886
Well, there are a lot
of intestines here,

00:17:10,953 --> 00:17:12,721
but no appendix,

00:17:12,788 --> 00:17:14,356
which made sense
when I saw this.

00:17:14,423 --> 00:17:15,758
A cecum.

00:17:15,824 --> 00:17:18,093
Dog entrails.

00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,294
Yeah.

00:17:19,361 --> 00:17:21,930
That's not going to help.

00:17:21,997 --> 00:17:23,198
I'm sorry.

00:17:23,265 --> 00:17:24,466
Catherine...

00:17:25,542 --> 00:17:27,410
has Nick's family been informed?

00:17:27,477 --> 00:17:31,481
No, that would be my job.

00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,420
SIDLE:
I swabbed the seal

00:17:37,487 --> 00:17:38,521
for epithelials,

00:17:38,588 --> 00:17:40,657
but there were no prints
on the outside of the bag.

00:17:40,724 --> 00:17:42,525
What about Nick's camera?

00:17:42,592 --> 00:17:43,727
No fingerprints.

00:17:43,793 --> 00:17:45,595
There were some photographs,
mostly generals.

00:17:45,662 --> 00:17:47,864
There were a few detail shots
of entrails and trash.

00:17:47,931 --> 00:17:49,966
But no lucky grabs of
anybody else at the scene.

00:17:50,033 --> 00:17:52,435
I don't think we're gonna
get lucky with this guy.

00:17:52,502 --> 00:17:53,770
He knows how to work clean.

00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:57,311
Grissom, I pulled all of Nick's
active and recent cases.

00:17:57,378 --> 00:17:59,747
I want to know anyone who
had a grudge against him.

00:17:59,814 --> 00:18:01,515
Civilian complaints,
death threats...

00:18:01,582 --> 00:18:02,516
Got it.

00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:03,818
There was a guy
a couple of years ago

00:18:03,884 --> 00:18:04,885
that stalked him.

00:18:04,952 --> 00:18:05,886
He may be back.

00:18:05,953 --> 00:18:07,655
I remember.
Top of the pile.

00:18:07,721 --> 00:18:10,191
I'm using your track
and wheelbase measurements

00:18:10,257 --> 00:18:13,727
plus or minus five percent
to account

00:18:13,794 --> 00:18:16,730
for rain-shadowing
and/or drying effects.

00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:21,202
All right, print it out.

00:18:21,268 --> 00:18:23,070
WARRICK:
I need you to bring up
the traffic cameras

00:18:23,137 --> 00:18:25,139
in a three-block radius

00:18:25,206 --> 00:18:27,975
between Flamingo and Koval
in the last 24 hours.

00:18:28,042 --> 00:18:29,410
We only buffer
the video

00:18:29,477 --> 00:18:30,878
for the past few hours.

00:18:30,945 --> 00:18:33,447
I can take you back
as far as 10:37 p.m.

00:18:33,514 --> 00:18:34,648
That's good enough.

00:18:34,715 --> 00:18:36,750
Our guy was taken around 11:00.

00:18:40,087 --> 00:18:41,021
Scan forward.

00:18:41,088 --> 00:18:42,189
We're looking for a big truck.

00:18:48,262 --> 00:18:50,030
How about that one?

00:18:50,097 --> 00:18:51,599
Looks like a Suburban.

00:18:55,069 --> 00:18:56,871
It's on the list.

00:18:59,607 --> 00:19:01,509
Whoa, he's racing.

00:19:01,575 --> 00:19:02,510
Wait a minute.

00:19:02,576 --> 00:19:04,245
That one, the big Ford.

00:19:06,947 --> 00:19:08,115
Follow it.

00:19:58,399 --> 00:20:02,102
WARRICK:
The Expedition truck
left the area around 11:15.

00:20:02,169 --> 00:20:03,370
Definitely in a hurry.

00:20:03,437 --> 00:20:05,573
Took a right off Koval
onto Tropicana,

00:20:05,639 --> 00:20:08,709
crossed Las Vegas Boulevard
onto the 15 South.

00:20:08,776 --> 00:20:10,044
And then it drove
off the grid.

00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,812
At least we have
a general direction.

00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:13,180
SIDLE:
Great, so Nick could be anywhere

00:20:13,247 --> 00:20:15,349
from Green Valley
to Seven Hills to Arizona.

00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:17,051
Assuming he was in that truck.

00:20:17,117 --> 00:20:19,253
WILLOWS:
Well, according to Hodges,
the white fibers

00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,656
on Nick's vest were cotton
with traces of ether...

00:20:22,723 --> 00:20:26,193
( <i>grunting</i> )

00:20:29,663 --> 00:20:31,565
Ether?
That's old school.

00:20:31,632 --> 00:20:34,201
WARRICK:
Yeah, stuff is volatile.

00:20:34,268 --> 00:20:35,202
Flammable.

00:20:35,269 --> 00:20:36,370
Outside of meth cooks,

00:20:36,437 --> 00:20:37,872
no one uses it
anymore.

00:20:37,938 --> 00:20:39,640
People use what they know.

00:20:39,707 --> 00:20:43,611
All right, so, where are we
on possible suspects?

00:20:43,677 --> 00:20:46,580
So far, none of Nick's active
or recent cases stands out.

00:20:46,647 --> 00:20:48,649
And his old stalker's
still behind bars.

00:20:48,716 --> 00:20:51,252
Maybe it's a random act.

00:20:51,318 --> 00:20:52,286
WILLOWS:
Well, that's possible.

00:20:52,353 --> 00:20:53,988
Because whoever staged
the crime scene

00:20:54,054 --> 00:20:56,357
couldn't have known
that Nick was going to respond.

00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:58,125
Yeah, it was just
bad luck he did.

00:20:58,192 --> 00:20:59,193
Sara,

00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,895
what about the coffee cup?

00:21:00,961 --> 00:21:03,798
No DNA or prints on the cup
or in the bag.

00:21:03,864 --> 00:21:05,466
HODGES:
Don't touch the edge of it!

00:21:05,533 --> 00:21:06,567

00:21:10,304 --> 00:21:11,906
Hold still. Hold still.

00:21:11,972 --> 00:21:14,275
Hey, I told you, you
got to sign for that!

00:21:14,341 --> 00:21:15,843
What are you doing, Hodges?

00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:18,078
Guy comes in here with a package
with no return address.

00:21:18,145 --> 00:21:19,146
You're violating
my rights!

00:21:19,213 --> 00:21:20,181
I want a lawyer!

00:21:20,247 --> 00:21:21,015
Shut up.

00:21:22,116 --> 00:21:23,851
Way the guy was pawing
that envelope,

00:21:23,918 --> 00:21:25,019
I figure I better
get it away from him

00:21:25,085 --> 00:21:26,086
before he wipes off
all the trace.

00:21:26,153 --> 00:21:27,855
What trace?

00:21:27,922 --> 00:21:30,291
It's about Nick.

It's-it's against

No, we haven't yet, but...

they should be contacting us
in roughly four hours.

00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:53,800
We were able to rustle up
$20,000 cash.

Now, we can sell the cars.

00:36:39,218 --> 00:36:42,922
Considering the problems
that you've had with the law,

00:36:42,989 --> 00:36:45,291
you could use
some good publicity.

00:36:45,358 --> 00:36:48,427
Do I look like a man
that needs publicity?

00:36:48,494 --> 00:36:51,130
If you're coming to me
like a cop

00:36:51,197 --> 00:36:54,934
with a tin cup in your hand,
the answer is no.

00:36:56,836 --> 00:36:59,739
I'm not here as a cop.

00:37:02,542 --> 00:37:05,778
Then ask me
like you were my daughter.

00:37:14,053 --> 00:37:15,388
I got the money.

00:37:15,454 --> 00:37:17,657
From where?

00:37:17,723 --> 00:37:19,926
Where do you think?

00:37:30,291 --> 00:37:32,500
Catherine, if the press
finds out about this,

00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,769
it'll look like Sam Braun
bribed the lab.

00:37:34,836 --> 00:37:35,937
He's a casino owner.

00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:36,938
A leader of industry.

00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:38,373
Never convicted of any crime.

00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,674
And right now, I don't care

00:37:39,741 --> 00:37:41,250
about the integrity of the lab
at the moment.

00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:42,317
I care about Nick.

00:37:42,384 --> 00:37:43,752
Yeah, well, so do I,
but nonetheless...

00:37:43,819 --> 00:37:44,753
Well, you're
sitting here

00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,321
like Jack Handy
with your deep thoughts,

00:37:46,388 --> 00:37:47,356
staring at a coffee cup.

00:37:47,423 --> 00:37:48,857
You got a better plan,
I'm all ears.

00:37:52,628 --> 00:37:54,029
( <i>exhales</i> )

00:37:54,096 --> 00:37:55,197
All right.

00:37:55,264 --> 00:37:56,865
But I make the drop.

00:37:56,932 --> 00:37:58,867
You're hands off.

00:37:58,934 --> 00:38:00,202
That's my money.

00:38:00,269 --> 00:38:02,037
You can't be seen
anywhere near this money.

00:38:02,104 --> 00:38:04,273
It was given to the lab
anonymously.

00:38:04,339 --> 00:38:05,708
Agreed?

00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:09,078
Agreed.

00:39:02,875 --> 00:39:04,977
Las Vegas Crime Lab.

00:39:05,043 --> 00:39:07,279
MAN:
Through the door.

00:39:55,661 --> 00:39:59,598
Pretty quiet outside.

00:39:59,665 --> 00:40:03,402
Almost sounds like
you came alone.

00:40:03,469 --> 00:40:05,771
I've got your money.

00:40:08,273 --> 00:40:10,142
Put it down.

00:40:19,818 --> 00:40:22,020
Slide it over.

00:40:36,969 --> 00:40:38,137
You're telling me

00:40:38,203 --> 00:40:39,571
there's a million dollars
in here.

00:40:39,638 --> 00:40:40,939
Yes.

00:40:41,006 --> 00:40:43,776
Along with some cute
little booby traps?

00:40:43,842 --> 00:40:47,946
Which is it--
a tracer, a dye pack?

00:40:48,013 --> 00:40:50,015
Normally, you'd be 100% right,

00:40:50,082 --> 00:40:52,251
but this time,
you're 100% wrong.

00:40:52,317 --> 00:40:54,353
We want Nick back, no tricks.

00:41:14,773 --> 00:41:17,209
( <i>chuckling softly</i> )

00:41:17,276 --> 00:41:18,644
This looks real.

00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:20,712
It is real.

00:41:20,779 --> 00:41:22,548
Where is Nick?

00:41:24,917 --> 00:41:28,153
You know,
I was under the impression

00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:31,323
it was against
departmental policy

00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:34,093
to negotiate with terrorists.

00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:36,128
Are you a terrorist?

00:41:36,195 --> 00:41:37,696
Depends.

00:41:39,631 --> 00:41:42,167
Are you terrified?

00:41:43,969 --> 00:41:45,959
Look, I really don't want
to talk to you.

00:41:45,959 --> 00:41:46,893
Where is my guy?

00:41:47,625 --> 00:41:50,917
Oh, so... he is your guy, huh?

00:41:50,917 --> 00:41:52,041
Yes, he is.

00:41:52,041 --> 00:41:53,291
Where is he buried?

00:41:53,291 --> 00:41:56,494
Are you two close?

00:41:56,561 --> 00:41:58,864
That's none of your business.

00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:01,566
What does Nick Stokes
mean to you?

00:42:01,633 --> 00:42:06,404
How do you feel when you see him
in that coffin?

00:42:06,471 --> 00:42:11,610
Does your soul die
every time you push that button?

00:42:11,676 --> 00:42:17,415
How do you feel,
knowing that there's
nothing you can do

00:42:17,482 --> 00:42:20,385
to get him out of that hell?

00:42:20,452 --> 00:42:23,688
Helpless...

00:42:23,755 --> 00:42:27,359
useless...

00:42:27,425 --> 00:42:29,461
impotent?

00:42:31,463 --> 00:42:33,198
Good.

00:42:33,265 --> 00:42:36,959
Welcome to my world.

00:42:39,792 --> 00:42:44,208
Uh, if I were you,
I'd back up a little.
