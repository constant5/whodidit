but today we got jammed.

00:11:05,336 --> 00:11:06,938
What was the problem?

00:11:07,005 --> 00:11:08,973
Computer went down,
plumbing backed up.

00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,241
You name it, we had it.

00:11:10,308 --> 00:11:11,743
Any rival bangers
in the same cell?

00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:15,213
No. I rechecked the roster.
We don't want the yo's

00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,282
killing each other
in custody.

00:11:17,348 --> 00:11:19,217
Why we bother, I'll never know.

00:11:19,284 --> 00:11:22,287
You ever think an overcrowded
cell mixed with bad plumbing

00:11:22,353 --> 00:11:24,355
was the reason
they threw the contents?

00:11:24,422 --> 00:11:25,690
They don't need a reason.

00:11:25,757 --> 00:11:27,091
Bad monkeys at the zoo.

00:11:31,296 --> 00:11:34,566
So, uh, how did the gun
get past security?

00:11:34,632 --> 00:11:36,267
Arresting officer
did a bad search.

00:11:36,334 --> 00:11:37,435
Don't you search them again

00:11:37,502 --> 00:11:38,870
when they get
to the holding cell?

00:11:38,937 --> 00:11:39,938
What?

00:11:40,004 --> 00:11:42,607
Don't you search them
again when they get here?

00:11:42,674 --> 00:11:44,609
Is there something you want
to get off your chest?

00:11:44,676 --> 00:11:45,777
( <i>wry chuckle</i> )

00:11:45,844 --> 00:11:48,813
A gun in a cell is
sloppy police work, man.

00:11:51,349 --> 00:11:54,285
I don't like what you're
implying about me or my men.

00:11:54,352 --> 00:11:57,455
Then maybe you need to
dial down your attitude.

00:11:57,522 --> 00:11:59,224
A man is brain dead here!

00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:01,392
I don't care what he was
like when he was alive,

00:12:01,459 --> 00:12:03,261
and neither should you,
don't you think?

00:12:03,328 --> 00:12:04,963
All I know, there's
one less bastard

00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:06,231
I gotta watch my back for.

00:12:06,297 --> 00:12:08,600
There's five of us, so the
odds are in their favor.

You're a crime scene tech.

00:12:10,768 --> 00:12:12,137
I'm law enforcement, which means

00:12:12,203 --> 00:12:14,239
you don't get to tell me
what to do in my jail.

00:12:14,305 --> 00:12:15,907
If I find out you used
excessive force

00:12:15,974 --> 00:12:17,976
on an unarmed prisoner,
you won't have a jail.

00:12:18,042 --> 00:12:18,977
I think we're done here.

00:12:19,043 --> 00:12:19,978
I don't think so.

00:12:20,044 --> 00:12:21,479

00:12:41,032 --> 00:12:42,667
I'm sorry, no hits.

00:12:42,734 --> 00:12:44,536
Yeah, I'm
not surprised.

00:12:44,602 --> 00:12:46,304
They didn't care

why would they
report him missing?

00:12:51,309 --> 00:12:52,677
What's going on in here?

00:12:52,744 --> 00:12:55,113
The victim had a prior
abuse fracture.

00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,114
And you're hoping

00:12:56,181 --> 00:12:58,016
Child Protective Services
investigated?

00:12:58,082 --> 00:12:59,751
Well, based on the age
of the victim,

00:12:59,818 --> 00:13:01,920
the age of the fracture
and the break pattern,

00:13:01,986 --> 00:13:03,321
I found ten possible matches.

00:13:03,388 --> 00:13:07,358
Well, it's going to
take you forever

00:13:07,425 --> 00:13:08,760
to go through these alone.

00:13:10,461 --> 00:13:12,063
I'll get it done.

00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:16,034
It took me a long time
to get where I was, Sara.

00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:20,505
Now I feel like I'm
starting from scratch.

00:13:20,572 --> 00:13:21,840
I miss sleeping at night.

Why? You thinking bad cop?

00:13:45,897 --> 00:13:49,100
Well, the batons were the only
weapons inside of the cell.

I can do it in person.

I actually did find

one hair with a root tag

I pulled the X rays
of our most likely

Sinus identification

Sinuses are unique; they have
distinct, scalloped edges.

No match.

It's harder to identify
children this way

00:15:26,564 --> 00:15:29,067

00:20:43,948 --> 00:20:46,851
That's compelling stuff
actually.

00:20:46,918 --> 00:20:50,889
Look, you can
question me, fine.

00:20:50,955 --> 00:20:53,758
You don't have to pretend
to be interested in me.

00:20:53,825 --> 00:20:56,227
I'm sorry, that was lame.

00:20:56,294 --> 00:21:00,131
I guess I was just trying
to put you at ease.

00:21:00,198 --> 00:21:02,133
I know what it's like.

00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,536
What?

00:21:04,602 --> 00:21:06,404
Living with strangers.

00:21:06,471 --> 00:21:08,206
Your fate being decided by

00:21:08,273 --> 00:21:10,708
social workers,
advocates, judges...

00:21:10,775 --> 00:21:12,944
You were in the system.

00:21:13,011 --> 00:21:15,880
For a while.

00:21:15,947 --> 00:21:20,985
I've been in foster care
for ten years.

00:21:21,052 --> 00:21:24,322
I moved from one
home to the next.

00:21:24,389 --> 00:21:27,592
Believe me, Mrs. Tenney
is one of the good ones.

00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:35,133
She's not very cooperative.

00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,535
She's been burned a lot.

00:21:37,602 --> 00:21:40,338
Look, I know she
comes off as tough,

00:21:40,405 --> 00:21:43,708
but she really cares.

00:21:43,775 --> 00:21:49,047
Enough to tell
us the truth,
even if it hurts.

00:21:49,113 --> 00:21:51,549
You remember a little boy
named Devon?

00:21:51,616 --> 00:21:53,952
Yeah. Cute kid.

00:21:54,018 --> 00:21:55,520
About five years old.

00:21:55,587 --> 00:21:58,756
Your foster mom said that
Devon left months ago.

00:21:58,823 --> 00:21:59,924
Is that true?

00:21:59,991 --> 00:22:01,493
Yeah.

00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:04,729
Why all the questions?

00:22:06,731 --> 00:22:08,533
Did something happen?

00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,902
Yeah.

00:22:12,737 --> 00:22:14,739
( <i>quietly</i> ):
Is he dead?

00:22:16,741 --> 00:22:18,409
Yeah.

00:22:21,513 --> 00:22:23,948
I don't understand.

00:22:24,015 --> 00:22:28,486
His mom came and picked him up.

00:22:28,553 --> 00:22:32,323
That never happens.

00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:35,160
You could just see how much
she loved those boys.

00:22:35,226 --> 00:22:38,630
Glynnis...

00:22:38,696 --> 00:22:41,299
did Devon have brothers
at the foster home?

00:22:41,366 --> 00:22:43,368
Yeah.

00:22:43,434 --> 00:22:45,537
Two older brothers,

00:22:45,603 --> 00:22:47,639
Kevin and, and Raymond.

00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:51,509
What happened to them?

00:22:54,959 --> 00:22:56,861
The boys' mother,
Candace Malton,

00:22:56,928 --> 00:22:59,230
served 47 of a
90-day sentence for
smashing a brick

00:22:59,297 --> 00:23:01,166
into her abusive
boyfriend's face.

00:23:01,667 --> 00:23:03,202
Sounds like self-defense to me.

00:23:03,269 --> 00:23:05,705
Yeah, if she would've walked
after the first hit.

00:23:05,772 --> 00:23:07,740
So, how many times
did she actually hit him?

00:23:07,807 --> 00:23:11,077
Five. It takes battered women
a while to see the light,

00:23:11,144 --> 00:23:13,246
but once they do,
there's no going back.

00:23:13,312 --> 00:23:15,815
Okay, so the Malton boys
were placed in foster care

00:23:15,882 --> 00:23:17,583
while Mom served
her sentence.

00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:18,751
A single mother,

00:23:18,818 --> 00:23:20,253
she reinstated her
parental rights

00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:21,654
as soon as she
got out of jail.

00:23:21,721 --> 00:23:23,156
After what happened
to her son,

00:23:23,222 --> 00:23:25,291
she didn't want to
have anything to do
with Child Services.

00:23:25,358 --> 00:23:26,926
Any idea where
the mother is now?

00:23:26,993 --> 00:23:28,027
No.

00:23:28,094 --> 00:23:29,595
I've already checked welfare,

00:23:29,662 --> 00:23:31,764
Medicaid, HUD rolls--
she's in the wind.

00:23:31,831 --> 00:23:33,433
( <i>Brass sighs</i> )

00:23:33,499 --> 00:23:34,700
I'll put out a BOLO.

00:23:34,767 --> 00:23:35,968
No offense, but...

00:23:36,035 --> 00:23:38,171
why didn't you check in
to the kids' welfare

00:23:38,237 --> 00:23:40,039
after the mom
was released from jail?

00:23:40,106 --> 00:23:44,243
8,000 child abuse/neglect
investigations a year.

00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:46,245
There's only so much we can do.

00:23:46,312 --> 00:23:49,449
Look, despite her taste in men,
in my opinion,

00:23:49,515 --> 00:23:51,951
Candace Malton
was a good mother.

00:23:52,018 --> 00:23:55,388
One of her sons is dead,
and the other two are missing.

00:23:56,989 --> 00:23:59,559
What's good about that?

00:24:02,829 --> 00:24:04,030
Hey, Mia.

00:24:04,097 --> 00:24:05,898
Have you finished
processing the batons?

00:24:05,965 --> 00:24:07,767
Yeah, just now.

00:24:07,834 --> 00:24:09,235
I found blood,
epithelials and hair

00:24:09,302 --> 00:24:11,104
on all of them.

00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:14,140
There are several DNA sources
from everyone but the victim.

00:24:14,207 --> 00:24:18,077
Which means that a police baton
never connected with Sam Mendez.

00:24:18,144 --> 00:24:19,479
He had to already
be down

00:24:19,545 --> 00:24:22,181
when the cops entered
the cell.

00:24:22,248 --> 00:24:23,416
Thanks.

00:24:24,751 --> 00:24:26,586

00:24:26,652 --> 00:24:28,588
Yeah.
Lieutenant
Arthur Chan,

00:24:28,654 --> 00:24:30,490
watch commander for
Central Holding.

00:24:30,556 --> 00:24:33,860
We are almost finished
with our investigation,

00:24:33,926 --> 00:24:36,329
but I can tell you that
the victim's prints

00:24:36,395 --> 00:24:38,531
don't match the Sam Mendez
that's wanted for murder.

00:24:38,598 --> 00:24:40,700
You telling me we
arrested the wrong guy?

00:24:40,767 --> 00:24:43,336
It was a routine traffic stop.

00:24:43,402 --> 00:24:45,605
The arresting officer
ran the name

00:24:45,671 --> 00:24:47,940
and got an immediate
warrant hit.

00:24:48,007 --> 00:24:51,043
<i>An arrest warrant</i>
<i>for murder and...</i>

00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,545

00:24:52,612 --> 00:24:53,446
Out of the car!

00:24:53,513 --> 00:24:55,348
What did I do?
Walk back.
Hands up.

00:24:55,414 --> 00:24:58,351
The arresting officer
did his job; I did my job.

00:24:58,418 --> 00:24:59,519
No one's saying
that you didn't.

00:24:59,585 --> 00:25:01,020
Your subordinate
Warrick Brown did.

00:25:01,087 --> 00:25:02,688
With all due respect,
Lieutenant,

00:25:02,755 --> 00:25:05,591
that really doesn't sound
like the Warrick Brown I know.

00:25:05,658 --> 00:25:06,893
You're a civilian,

00:25:06,959 --> 00:25:08,961
but even you understand
chain of command.

00:25:09,028 --> 00:25:12,532
Now, I'm giving you
an opportunity to
adjust his attitude.

00:25:12,598 --> 00:25:15,501
Don't make me.

00:25:18,905 --> 00:25:21,140
Heard you found a
print on the bin.

00:25:21,207 --> 00:25:23,910
Yeah, I did.
Under the lip curve.

00:25:27,113 --> 00:25:28,815
What?

00:25:28,881 --> 00:25:31,050
Well, I'm not sure of the best
way to process the print.

00:25:31,117 --> 00:25:32,318
You take digital photos?

00:25:32,385 --> 00:25:34,053
Yeah.
Well, hand
them over.

00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,321
I'll load it into

while you finish processing.

00:25:38,424 --> 00:25:40,827
Well, what else is there
left to do but run it

00:25:40,893 --> 00:25:42,161
through AFIS?

00:25:42,228 --> 00:25:45,064
You're gonna need an
actual print for court.

00:25:45,131 --> 00:25:48,835
Are you saying
that I have to cut it out

00:25:48,901 --> 00:25:50,336
in order to lift it?

00:25:50,403 --> 00:25:52,071
Isn't that destroying
the evidence?
No.

00:25:52,138 --> 00:25:53,339
You're recovering it.

00:25:53,406 --> 00:25:55,108
As long as you document it,
you're fine.

All I did was
take out the trash.

00:27:38,578 --> 00:27:39,846
That's all I did.

00:27:39,912 --> 00:27:41,114

I don't remember
if she told me her last name.

00:27:58,364 --> 00:28:00,833
Anyway, we had some fun,
and when I was done,

00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,769
she told me
to take out the trash.

Really?

00:28:48,114 --> 00:28:49,582
I wonder what for.

00:28:49,649 --> 00:28:52,218
To complain about you.

00:28:52,285 --> 00:28:54,787
Wish you told me
you'd had a beef with him.

00:28:54,854 --> 00:28:56,222
There was nothing to say.

00:28:56,289 --> 00:28:58,858
We had words, it got heated,
then it was over.

00:30:49,102 --> 00:30:51,270
( <i>beeping</i> )

00:31:09,088 --> 00:31:11,724
We now know the cops
were not responsible,

00:31:11,791 --> 00:31:13,993
so that leaves us
with 34 suspects,

00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,762
all with rap sheets.

00:31:15,828 --> 00:31:17,730
Is there anything
to narrow the focus?

00:31:17,797 --> 00:31:20,099
Well, I compared
all 34 pairs--

00:31:20,166 --> 00:31:23,236
I came up with
one sole pattern...

00:31:23,302 --> 00:31:26,839
and one suspect--
Vincent Mendoza...

00:31:26,906 --> 00:31:29,909
booked for
meth manufacture.

00:31:29,976 --> 00:31:31,511
Well, the official
C.O.D. was

00:31:31,577 --> 00:31:34,080
blunt force trauma
to the head, not stomping.

00:31:34,147 --> 00:31:35,882
Well, it's not unreasonable
to think the same guy

00:31:35,948 --> 00:31:37,450
that caused the
blunt force trauma

00:31:37,517 --> 00:31:38,518
can also stomp him.

00:31:38,584 --> 00:31:39,552
Well, that all
sounds good,

00:31:39,619 --> 00:31:41,587
but why go to all that trouble?

00:31:41,654 --> 00:31:43,723
Because the gun was hot.

00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:45,158
Ran it though IBIS.

00:31:45,224 --> 00:31:47,427
It was used
in an execution-style murder.

00:31:47,493 --> 00:31:49,061
The last thing
the guy wanted to do

00:31:49,128 --> 00:31:51,431
was to get caught with a gun
that had a body on it.

00:31:51,497 --> 00:31:54,033
WARRICK:
Yeah, well, this
victim looks like

00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,968
the perfect patsy
to drop a gun on.

00:31:56,035 --> 00:31:58,404
STOKES:
Yeah...

00:31:58,471 --> 00:32:02,141
little fish
in a tank full of sharks.

00:32:04,125 --> 00:32:05,593
What's on the table,
gentlemen?

00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,062
Murder, two counts.

00:32:07,128 --> 00:32:10,465
Your client killed a man
in a holding cell

00:32:10,532 --> 00:32:12,334
and tried to frame
the cops for it.

00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,702
That's bull and you know it.

00:32:13,768 --> 00:32:15,003
Shh.

00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:17,272
Let's hear
the corroborating evidence,

00:32:17,339 --> 00:32:18,673
and it'd better be good.

00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,942
Mr. Mendoza was hooked
in a raid on a meth lab.

00:32:21,009 --> 00:32:22,977
Problem was, he was carrying
a concealed weapon

00:32:23,044 --> 00:32:24,813
and had no time
to ditch it.

00:32:24,879 --> 00:32:26,915
BROWN:
He dropped the weapon
down his pants,

00:32:26,981 --> 00:32:29,517
planned to get rid of it
in central holding

00:32:29,584 --> 00:32:31,019
before the cavity search.

00:32:31,086 --> 00:32:32,821
So far, I'm not hearing

00:32:32,887 --> 00:32:34,756
anything you can
actually prove.

00:32:34,823 --> 00:32:37,325
Well, I'm sure Vincent here
knew a lot of people inside

00:32:37,392 --> 00:32:39,494
since he is
a repeat offender.

00:32:39,561 --> 00:32:41,796
But only one man
didn't fit, huh?

00:32:41,863 --> 00:32:44,299
Fear must've been rolling
off him in waves so strong

00:32:44,366 --> 00:32:45,700
you could probably smell it.

00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,548
What you looking at, huh?

00:33:00,615 --> 00:33:01,783
Nothing. Nothing.

00:33:03,651 --> 00:33:05,487
I said, what're you
looking at, mark?

00:33:05,553 --> 00:33:07,088
Nothing.

00:33:17,098 --> 00:33:19,401
911! 911, man!

00:33:24,439 --> 00:33:26,207
Typical.

00:33:26,274 --> 00:33:28,777
Knew you guys would
try to pin this on me.

00:33:28,843 --> 00:33:30,812
I wasn't anywhere near the fish.

00:33:30,879 --> 00:33:32,447
You sure about that?

00:33:32,514 --> 00:33:34,149
That's what I said, isn't it?

00:33:34,215 --> 00:33:36,584
Well, it's good to know,
since your boot prints

00:33:36,651 --> 00:33:38,319
were found on the victim's head.

00:33:39,654 --> 00:33:41,022
See, you didn't
want to get caught

00:33:41,089 --> 00:33:43,892
with a gun used
in another homicide.

00:33:43,958 --> 00:33:46,061
A meth dealer,
your partner,

00:33:46,127 --> 00:33:48,563
was found in the desert
two weeks ago.

00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:50,065
Any one of those guys

00:33:50,131 --> 00:33:52,167
could've carried a gun
into the holding cell.

00:33:52,233 --> 00:33:54,869
It's not likely, unless you
can explain how Vincent here

00:33:54,936 --> 00:33:58,306
got his pubic hair and feces
caught in the gun's hammer.

00:34:01,042 --> 00:34:03,044
Give us some time.

00:34:05,513 --> 00:34:07,649
How's 25 to life sound?

00:34:09,651 --> 00:34:13,755
♪ True respect and ghetto love ♪

00:34:13,822 --> 00:34:16,858

♪ Because it... ♪

$40 buys the lips,
a hundy gets you south.

00:34:26,468 --> 00:34:27,869
Goes double for
around the world.

00:34:27,936 --> 00:34:29,104
You got a car?

00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:30,338
You sure about that?
Mm-hmm.

00:34:30,405 --> 00:34:32,307
'Cause you don't look
like you got a car to me.

00:34:32,374 --> 00:34:34,676
Take a hike, John.
I'm her next appointment.

00:34:36,644 --> 00:34:39,180
I didn't do nothing
but sit here, Officer.

00:34:39,247 --> 00:34:40,949
On your feet.

00:34:41,016 --> 00:34:43,151
Can't believe you're gonna
ruin my day for this.

00:34:43,218 --> 00:34:45,653
You don't have enough
to charge me with solicitation.

00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,155
Hey! Watch it, bitch.

00:34:47,222 --> 00:34:49,657
It's a wig, hair is consistent.

00:34:49,724 --> 00:34:52,193
Could you open your mouth
for me, please?

00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,195
Come on, you can do that
in your sleep, honey.

00:34:54,262 --> 00:34:56,097
Open up or we'll have
to stick you with a needle.

00:35:03,304 --> 00:35:04,606
( <i>knocking on door</i> )

00:35:08,276 --> 00:35:09,678
Taking your pet for a walk?

00:35:09,744 --> 00:35:12,747
I know how much you like
my little fetal pig,

00:35:12,814 --> 00:35:15,517
so I'm giving him to you
as an office-warming gift.

00:35:15,583 --> 00:35:18,720
That is so thoughtful.

00:35:20,488 --> 00:35:22,757
Now tell me why
you really stopped by.

00:35:22,824 --> 00:35:24,559
You checking up on me?

00:35:24,626 --> 00:35:25,593
No.

00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:28,229
What've you heard?

00:35:28,296 --> 00:35:29,731
Who talked to you?

00:35:29,798 --> 00:35:30,732
See?

00:35:30,799 --> 00:35:32,200
You've been on the job
for a week

00:35:32,267 --> 00:35:33,568
and you're already paranoid.

00:35:37,605 --> 00:35:40,508
When I was your right-hand
and your left,

00:35:40,575 --> 00:35:43,244
I always knew that
if it hit the fan,

00:35:43,311 --> 00:35:45,547
that you'd be the
one to get dirty.

00:35:45,613 --> 00:35:47,615
Hey, that's the job.

00:35:47,682 --> 00:35:50,618
Yeah, that's the job.

00:35:52,654 --> 00:35:54,756
Did you ever play politics?

00:35:54,823 --> 00:36:00,662
I once ran for president of
the science club in junior high.

00:36:00,729 --> 00:36:03,298
Mary Hardy beat me out
by one vote.

00:36:03,365 --> 00:36:07,902
I'm going to guess that
you didn't vote for yourself.

00:36:10,939 --> 00:36:12,974
I'm not any good at politics.

00:36:13,041 --> 00:36:15,043
And it's cost me.

00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:17,312
It's how I lost
Nick and Warrick.

00:36:17,379 --> 00:36:21,816
Your loss was my gain.

00:36:21,883 --> 00:36:24,786
Yeah.

00:36:24,853 --> 00:36:27,889
And at least
they're in good hands.

00:36:27,956 --> 00:36:32,927
We been sitting here
a long-ass time.

00:36:32,994 --> 00:36:34,996
What can I say,
I like your company.

00:36:35,063 --> 00:36:38,266
What'd you bring me
down here for?

00:36:38,333 --> 00:36:40,735
I was only trying
to make a few bucks.

00:36:40,802 --> 00:36:42,570
Yeah.

00:36:42,637 --> 00:36:44,072
( <i>light knocking</i> )

00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:47,676
DNA's a match.

00:36:49,277 --> 00:36:50,779
Match to what?

00:36:50,845 --> 00:36:51,780
To one of your hairs

00:36:51,846 --> 00:36:53,415
that you left
on the body of a little boy.

00:36:53,481 --> 00:36:55,116
I don't know
what you're talking about.

00:36:55,183 --> 00:36:56,651
BRASS:
No?

00:36:56,718 --> 00:36:59,254
I wonder why anyone
would leave one kid with you

00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,355
much less three.

00:37:00,422 --> 00:37:03,224
You have seven ileals in
common with the dead boy.

00:37:03,291 --> 00:37:05,226
Although that's not enough
to say you're related,

00:37:05,293 --> 00:37:06,828
it's certainly enough
to keep digging.

00:37:06,895 --> 00:37:10,098
You know, I ran your wants
and warrants.

00:37:10,165 --> 00:37:11,733
It kicked out some aliases.

00:37:13,935 --> 00:37:15,804
I mean,
Devine's a street name.

00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:18,473
But you're also known
as Darlene Lewis,

00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,442
married briefly to a grifter.

00:37:20,508 --> 00:37:26,948
And a.k.a. Darlene Malton.

00:37:27,015 --> 00:37:29,617
Hey, that's the same
last name as the victim.

00:37:29,684 --> 00:37:31,186
SIDLE:
To starve anyone

00:37:31,252 --> 00:37:32,921
is beyond me,

00:37:32,987 --> 00:37:38,560
but to do it to a child...
a relative, is unforgivable.

00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:51,239
Wasn't even like that.

00:37:51,306 --> 00:37:52,307
My half-sister Candy

00:37:52,374 --> 00:37:54,609
left me with them bad-ass kids
and no money.

00:37:54,676 --> 00:37:56,311
How am I supposed to feed them?

00:37:56,378 --> 00:37:58,380
You don't look like
you've missed any meals to me.

00:37:58,446 --> 00:37:59,781
Know what, skinny bitch,
go to hell.

00:37:59,848 --> 00:38:00,882
I just scrape by.

00:38:00,949 --> 00:38:02,517
If you couldn't
take care of them,

00:38:02,584 --> 00:38:04,652
why didn't you just turn them
over to Social Services?

00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:06,421
I promised I wouldn't.

00:38:06,488 --> 00:38:08,490
Little D got hurt last time.

00:38:08,556 --> 00:38:10,358
She would've killed me.

00:38:10,425 --> 00:38:13,094
What's she going to do when
she finds out her son is dead?

00:38:13,161 --> 00:38:15,997
I did the best I could.

00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:18,967
Okay, where are the boys now?

00:38:21,836 --> 00:38:25,674
Uh-uh, you're not gonna
blame this on me.

00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,775
I want a lawyer.

00:38:26,841 --> 00:38:28,710
You can have a lawyer

00:38:28,777 --> 00:38:31,046
after you give me
the address.

00:38:31,112 --> 00:38:33,014
But let me tell you something--

00:38:33,081 --> 00:38:35,417
if those boys die,
I'm going to make it my business

00:38:35,483 --> 00:38:37,052
to see you get
the death penalty.

00:38:47,328 --> 00:38:48,530
There's no one
in the house.

00:38:48,596 --> 00:38:50,131
Where are the kids?

00:38:50,198 --> 00:38:52,233
I don't know,
let's check around back.

00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:56,538
So, turns out that Mom
was sending money after all.

00:38:56,604 --> 00:38:58,673
I found this letter inside
mailed from Seattle

00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:01,042
with 300 bucks in it
for the kids' upkeep.

00:39:01,109 --> 00:39:04,612
And that skanky bitch
used it to buy a new TV.

00:39:47,088 --> 00:39:49,457
SIDLE:
Paint chips.

00:39:49,524 --> 00:39:51,359
SANDERS:
Smells like a toilet.

00:39:58,099 --> 00:40:01,536
Yeah, she never
let them upstairs.

00:40:01,603 --> 00:40:04,005
Kevin, Raymond...

00:40:04,072 --> 00:40:05,306
Oh, no.

00:40:05,373 --> 00:40:07,075
I'm going to call an ambulance.

00:40:11,913 --> 00:40:13,148
He's alive!

00:40:13,214 --> 00:40:15,550
We need water and blankets.

00:40:15,617 --> 00:40:18,086
Oh, my gosh.

00:40:20,255 --> 00:40:23,758
Hey. Are you Kevin
or Raymond?

00:40:23,825 --> 00:40:26,461
It's all right.

00:40:26,528 --> 00:40:30,098
It's all right, you're safe now.

00:40:30,165 --> 00:40:32,200
It's okay.

00:40:43,712 --> 00:40:47,749
So, Seattle P.D. has
located Candace Malton.

00:40:47,816 --> 00:40:49,851
They're putting her
on a plane tonight.

00:40:49,918 --> 00:40:51,820
They said
she's pretty broken up.

00:40:51,886 --> 00:40:54,422
She left her kids
with her hooker cousin.

00:40:54,489 --> 00:40:56,257
She should've known better.

00:40:57,959 --> 00:40:59,594
Where are you going
to take her first,

00:40:59,661 --> 00:41:00,862
the hospital or the morgue?

00:41:00,929 --> 00:41:02,697
Guess I might as well
get it over with.

00:41:02,764 --> 00:41:03,898
I mean,
once she sees the kids

00:41:03,965 --> 00:41:05,900
she's not going to
want to leave them.

00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:10,405
What do you think?

00:41:10,472 --> 00:41:14,542
Go with the living, Jim.

00:41:14,609 --> 00:41:16,291
The dead can wait.
