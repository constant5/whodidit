( <i>siren wails in distance</i> )

00:00:08,113 --> 00:00:12,017
( <i>heavy breathing</i>
<i>through respirator</i> )

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,500
Get a list
of all the countries

00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,702
she's visited
in the past 30 days.

00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:28,972
Yeah, her passport.

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,006
Try the State Department.

00:00:30,073 --> 00:00:31,074
My husband, please.

00:00:31,141 --> 00:00:32,075
Yeah.

00:00:32,142 --> 00:00:34,544
I have to tell my husband!

00:00:34,611 --> 00:00:36,379
Oh, please call my husband!

00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:12,678
Ma'am, I'm sorry,
but you can't go up.

00:01:12,745 --> 00:01:14,780
Catherine Willows,
Crime Lab.

00:01:14,847 --> 00:01:16,048
I know who you are,

00:01:16,115 --> 00:01:17,316
but hotel rooms
are under quarantine.

00:01:17,383 --> 00:01:19,518
No one goes up,
no one goes down.

00:01:19,585 --> 00:01:21,120
Quarantine?

00:01:44,777 --> 00:01:45,978
Okay, David.

00:01:52,451 --> 00:01:53,452
False alarm.

00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:54,520
We're clear.

00:02:04,763 --> 00:02:05,798
VARTANN:
Hey.

00:02:05,864 --> 00:02:06,865
Hi.

00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:15,177
Someone want to fill me in here?

00:02:15,244 --> 00:02:17,946
David assessed a potentially
infectious agent,

00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:19,548
and per protocol,
he remained at the site

00:02:19,615 --> 00:02:21,183
and called it in.

00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,317
Her red blotches
are consistent

00:02:22,384 --> 00:02:23,919
with CDC photos of Ebola.

00:02:23,986 --> 00:02:25,120
ROBBINS:
You did the right thing.

00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:28,323
So what are we looking at?

00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:32,928
Um, 419,
suspicious circs.

00:02:32,995 --> 00:02:36,265
Honestly,
I have no idea.

00:02:36,331 --> 00:02:40,035
Okay, it's my turn now.

00:02:40,102 --> 00:02:42,204
Clear the scene.

Sorry I'm late.

00:03:28,543 --> 00:03:30,011
I was processing
the scene.

00:03:30,078 --> 00:03:31,413
Nothing probative.

00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:33,915
There are 42
distinct laser burns

00:03:33,982 --> 00:03:35,517
on Julie Stern's body.

00:03:35,584 --> 00:03:36,718
Lasers?

00:03:36,785 --> 00:03:37,953
Lasers cauterize
the skin

00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:39,154
as they destroy tissue.

00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,424
Lack of blood and scabbing
confirms their use,

00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:43,558
so best guess would be

00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:45,827
she recently underwent
a cosmetic procedure.

00:03:45,894 --> 00:03:49,564
( <i>zapping</i> )

00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:54,202
That's consistent with the
hotel manager's statement.

00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:56,538
Said the vic had booked
into the Safari Suite.

00:03:56,605 --> 00:03:58,773
Please tell me
that has nothing to do

00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,242
with hunting wild game.

00:04:00,308 --> 00:04:02,677
Women who... don't want
their friends to know

00:04:02,744 --> 00:04:04,212
that they're freshening up

00:04:04,279 --> 00:04:06,715
will check into the suite
while they heal.

00:04:06,781 --> 00:04:09,684
Well, five-star hotel's got to
be cheaper than a hospital stay.

00:04:09,751 --> 00:04:11,553
So, could complications
from this procedure

00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,787
have resulted in her death?

00:04:12,854 --> 00:04:14,289
No.

00:04:14,356 --> 00:04:16,992
Histamine levels are normal.

00:04:17,058 --> 00:04:19,427
There's no post-op infection.

00:04:19,494 --> 00:04:21,429
But look at her fingernails.

00:04:21,496 --> 00:04:23,231
WILLOWS:
Mees lines;

00:04:23,298 --> 00:04:26,067
indicative of heavy metal
poisoning.

00:04:26,134 --> 00:04:28,236
I sent blood and hair
samples to Tox.

00:04:28,303 --> 00:04:29,704
Anything else?

00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:31,473
I'm not sure if it's probative,

00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:33,541
but I found ten cc's of urine
in her stomach.

00:04:33,608 --> 00:04:35,844
Digestive system's
intact.

00:04:35,911 --> 00:04:36,878
There are

00:04:36,945 --> 00:04:39,080
no bruises or abrasions
in her mouth,

00:04:39,147 --> 00:04:41,416
so there's only one way
it could have gotten there.

00:04:41,483 --> 00:04:42,784
Chugalug.

00:04:42,851 --> 00:04:43,885
Mm-hmm.

00:04:54,729 --> 00:04:56,398
Okay.

00:04:56,464 --> 00:04:57,399
So two days ago

00:04:57,465 --> 00:04:59,601
the residence was tented
for termites.

00:04:59,668 --> 00:05:01,903
This morning,
the bug guys came
to clear the house.

00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:04,806
They found the homeowner
exterminated.

00:05:04,873 --> 00:05:08,076
He's ID'd
as Elliot Beckman,
42, lived alone.

00:05:08,143 --> 00:05:09,077
Body's in the family room.

00:05:09,144 --> 00:05:10,245
Who's been inside?

00:05:10,312 --> 00:05:12,981
Just the exterminators
and the paramedics who
pronounced.

00:05:13,048 --> 00:05:15,016
They entered and exited
through the front door.

00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:16,384
Good luck.

00:05:24,993 --> 00:05:27,395
Exterminators use
sulfuryl flouride.

00:05:27,462 --> 00:05:30,365
It kills the bugs
and then evaporates.

00:05:30,432 --> 00:05:32,767
Agro scientists call it
the "safety" fumigant.

00:05:32,834 --> 00:05:34,402
You know, I'm sure
he would disagree.

00:05:39,674 --> 00:05:42,510
( <i>crunches</i> )

00:05:45,013 --> 00:05:47,449
Eyeglasses on the floor.

00:05:50,685 --> 00:05:52,520
Got vomit?

00:05:52,587 --> 00:05:54,656
( <i>gas hissing</i> )

00:05:54,723 --> 00:05:56,324
( <i>gagging</i> )

00:06:23,885 --> 00:06:26,855
What flies when they're on
and floats when they're off?

00:06:26,922 --> 00:06:27,822
Feathers.

00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:30,058
Long and blue.

00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:31,226
I'll bag 'em.

00:06:33,628 --> 00:06:35,163
His cheek is bruised.

00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:38,099
What was he doing in here?

00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:39,100
Per the R&amp;R's,

00:06:39,167 --> 00:06:41,036
we conducted
a thorough walk-through

00:06:41,102 --> 00:06:42,737
before releasing the gas.

00:06:42,804 --> 00:06:45,173
No plants, people
or animals were left behind.

00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,208
All right, so you released
the gas, then what?

00:06:47,275 --> 00:06:48,343
I took off.

00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:50,679
Can't stick around
baby-sitting houses, you know?

00:06:50,745 --> 00:06:52,213
Once you left the house,

00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,050
could Beckman have snuck back in
in any way?

00:06:55,116 --> 00:06:56,484
Yeah, if he had
a death wish.

00:06:56,551 --> 00:06:58,620
The house is toxic
for the first 12 hours.

00:06:58,687 --> 00:07:00,188
Mm-hmm. Not to mention
it gets wrapped up tighter

00:07:00,255 --> 00:07:01,623
than a Christmas present.

00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:02,791
You know tented houses--

00:07:02,857 --> 00:07:04,459
they're prime targets
for burglars.

00:07:04,526 --> 00:07:08,797
We secure these on the outside
of every doorknob.

00:07:08,863 --> 00:07:10,131
Clamshell locks.

00:07:10,198 --> 00:07:11,199
Nobody gets inside.

00:07:11,266 --> 00:07:12,801
Yeah, says you.

00:07:16,171 --> 00:07:19,874
Yes, Ms. Stern
was in my care.

00:07:19,941 --> 00:07:22,244
And when was the last time
you saw her, Dr. Malaga?

00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:26,548
Uh, I ablated her liver spots
three days ago.

00:07:26,615 --> 00:07:29,284
Checked on her yesterday
at The Mediterranean.

00:07:29,351 --> 00:07:32,053
I applied post-op ointment
to prevent scabbing

00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,188
and infection.

00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:38,226
<i>She seemed, uh...</i>

00:07:38,293 --> 00:07:41,329
in good spirits.

00:07:42,764 --> 00:07:44,232
From the marks,
it looks like you lasered

00:07:44,299 --> 00:07:46,101
over 40 spots.

00:07:46,167 --> 00:07:47,102
In one session?

00:07:47,168 --> 00:07:49,237
Well, post op,
the patient's skin

00:07:49,304 --> 00:07:50,572
is very red and raw.

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,576
It's really quite ugly,
to be blunt.

00:07:54,643 --> 00:07:56,077
Most patients prefer
to minimize

00:07:56,144 --> 00:07:58,079
the amount of time
they spend in recovery.

00:07:58,146 --> 00:08:00,382
So you supersized the procedure.

00:08:00,448 --> 00:08:02,484
You did it all in one sitting?

00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:03,818
It's perfectly safe.

00:08:03,885 --> 00:08:05,854
We'll need a copy
of her medical records.

00:08:05,921 --> 00:08:07,022
Okay?

00:08:07,088 --> 00:08:09,658
Oh, I'm sorry, but her file
contains medical history

00:08:09,724 --> 00:08:11,793
which includes information
about other members

00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:12,861
of the family.

00:08:12,928 --> 00:08:14,462
I would be breaching

00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:17,933
doctor-patient confidentiality
if I let you have that.

00:08:24,339 --> 00:08:27,509
Hey, uh,

00:08:27,576 --> 00:08:28,777
do you have a problem

00:08:28,843 --> 00:08:30,345
with me, Doctor?

00:08:30,412 --> 00:08:31,980
Excuse me?

00:08:32,047 --> 00:08:33,348
Well, there are two of us here

00:08:33,415 --> 00:08:35,517
and you're only addressing
my colleague, so...

00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:39,688
Well, she's
a very beautiful woman.

00:08:40,522 --> 00:08:41,790
You have

00:08:41,856 --> 00:08:44,359
<i>Venus de Milo</i> aesthetics.

00:08:48,863 --> 00:08:49,998
We'll be getting
a court order

00:08:50,065 --> 00:08:51,666
for Ms. Stern's records.

00:08:51,733 --> 00:08:53,201
I'd appreciate that.

00:09:10,285 --> 00:09:11,319
Sara.

00:09:14,256 --> 00:09:16,224
Looks like someone
tampered with the tent.

00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,362
Window's open.

00:09:20,428 --> 00:09:21,997
Well, exterminators leave

00:09:22,063 --> 00:09:24,399
some windows open

00:09:24,466 --> 00:09:26,468
to help circulate the gas.

00:09:26,534 --> 00:09:28,270
This could have been
the victim's way in.

00:09:32,741 --> 00:09:35,877
Once inside,
he was overcome by the fumes.

00:09:41,216 --> 00:09:43,051
( <i>gas hissing</i> )

00:09:44,019 --> 00:09:45,954
( <i>gagging</i> )

00:09:46,588 --> 00:09:47,656
He must be an idiot

00:09:47,722 --> 00:09:49,291
to go inside
a tented house.

00:09:49,357 --> 00:09:51,126
Maybe he forgot something.

00:09:51,192 --> 00:09:52,560
Figured the gas
had dissipated.

00:09:52,627 --> 00:09:55,864
Well, assuming you're right,
and he went in and never left,

00:09:55,931 --> 00:09:57,799
shouldn't the window
be open wider?

00:10:03,338 --> 00:10:05,540
It's old.
The rope has snapped.

00:10:05,607 --> 00:10:06,541
Okay.

00:10:06,608 --> 00:10:10,712
Now, Mr. Beckman
never came out of the house.

00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:14,082
Why is there a trail of sand
leading away from it

00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:17,018
and straight
to the neighbor's house?

00:10:17,085 --> 00:10:18,620
That's a good
question.

00:10:28,897 --> 00:10:31,266
( <i>knocking</i> )

Can I help you?

00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:39,207
Yeah, we're
with the crime lab.

00:10:39,274 --> 00:10:40,275
We're investigating

00:10:40,342 --> 00:10:41,977
the death of your neighbor
next door.

00:10:42,043 --> 00:10:43,511
Elliot?

00:10:43,578 --> 00:10:44,512
What happened?

00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:46,948
That's what we're trying
to figure out.

00:10:47,015 --> 00:10:49,050

recently?

00:10:53,021 --> 00:10:55,123
Look, man, I've been laid up
for the past two days

00:10:56,191 --> 00:10:57,192
I haven't left my place.

00:10:57,259 --> 00:10:58,994
Do you live alone, Mr...?

00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,263
Rory Kendell.

00:11:01,329 --> 00:11:02,797
My wife bailed
a few months ago.

00:11:02,864 --> 00:11:05,634
Rory, have you felt
dizzy or disoriented?

00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,135
How would you know?

00:11:07,202 --> 00:11:08,436
We're going to need
a urine sample.

00:11:08,503 --> 00:11:09,437
Why?

from sulfuryl flouride
gas poisoning.

00:11:12,374 --> 00:11:14,943
Urination's the only way
for the poison to get out.

00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:15,977
I got the flu.

00:11:16,044 --> 00:11:17,345
If that's true,

00:11:17,412 --> 00:11:19,848
then your urine
will be sulfuryl-flouride free.

00:11:19,915 --> 00:11:21,283
But if you're lying,

00:11:21,349 --> 00:11:23,685
"you're in" big trouble.

00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:33,209
What do Ozzy Osbourne,

00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:36,646
Iron Maiden and our victim
all have in common?

00:11:36,713 --> 00:11:37,781
Heavy metal.

00:11:37,847 --> 00:11:40,717
Arsenic in her system,
poisoning was chronic.

00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:42,452
Looks like it began

00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:44,988
approximately
three months ago.

00:11:45,055 --> 00:11:47,524
Techs collected the ingestibles
found at her home.

00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:48,725
None were contaminated.

00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:50,493
Can Tox confirm that
arsenic poisoning

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,594
was the cause of death?

00:11:51,661 --> 00:11:53,296
Not yet.
Until the quants come back,

00:11:53,363 --> 00:11:55,465
we won't know if
the concentration was lethal.

00:11:55,532 --> 00:11:57,600
In poisoning cases, the
killer's usually a relative.

00:11:57,667 --> 00:11:58,568
Right.

00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:00,303
Someone with access
to the victim.

00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:04,674
Next-of-kin is
an only child, a son.

00:12:04,741 --> 00:12:07,110
Who has a vineyard in Pahrump.

00:12:07,177 --> 00:12:09,612
You sent a cop all the way
to Pahrump to bring me in.

00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:11,915
What couldn't we
discuss on the phone?

00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:15,952
When's the last time
you saw your mother?

00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:19,155
It was about
three months ago.

00:12:19,222 --> 00:12:21,024
She came to my vineyard
for a visit.

00:12:21,091 --> 00:12:22,025
How'd that go?

00:12:22,092 --> 00:12:22,959
She left early.

00:12:23,026 --> 00:12:24,794
Said she felt sick.

00:12:24,861 --> 00:12:27,964
But you didn't think so.

00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:30,967
Mom was uncomfortable
around my four-year-old.

00:12:31,034 --> 00:12:32,202
Why's that?

00:12:32,268 --> 00:12:34,771
He made her feel old.

00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:37,507
"Grandma"
was a dirty word.

00:12:37,574 --> 00:12:39,250
She could hardly
look at him.

00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,618
Nice, huh?

00:12:40,685 --> 00:12:43,454
Mr. Stern, I also did
a background check

00:12:43,521 --> 00:12:46,858
and you recently maxed out
three credit cards.

00:12:46,924 --> 00:12:49,794
My vines contracted black rot
last spring.

00:12:49,861 --> 00:12:51,362
It's an expensive
problem.

00:12:51,429 --> 00:12:52,830
Why are you checking my credit?

00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:55,033
You're weren't worried about
paying off your debt, were you?

00:12:55,099 --> 00:12:56,367
What the hell are you implying?

00:12:56,434 --> 00:12:57,735
You're about to come
into some money.

00:12:57,802 --> 00:13:00,271
When my dad died, he left
my mother boatloads of cash.

00:13:00,338 --> 00:13:02,273
On her last visit,
I asked her for a loan.

00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:04,342
Let me guess--
she turned you down.

00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:06,444
She'd spend thousands
on designer clothes,

00:13:06,511 --> 00:13:07,845
jewelry, plastic surgery...

00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,380
but wouldn't lend me a dime.

00:13:11,349 --> 00:13:14,419
Do you use pesticides
on your grapevines?

00:13:14,485 --> 00:13:16,688
Yeah. Organic's a fad.

00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,189
We're going to need
a sample of that.

00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:19,424
Whatever.

00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:20,725
We done?

00:13:22,894 --> 00:13:25,530
This one's easy--
he drowned.

00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,131
What?

00:13:27,198 --> 00:13:29,634
The termite fumigant
entered his bronchioles

00:13:29,701 --> 00:13:32,637
<i>causing his lungs</i>
<i>to fill with fluid.</i>

00:13:32,704 --> 00:13:36,174
COD is pulmonary edema
and respiratory arrest.

00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,176
Just like
a drowning victim.

00:13:38,242 --> 00:13:42,146
Doc, tell me about
the bruise on his cheek.

00:13:42,213 --> 00:13:46,084
Zygoma's fractured.
Check the X-ray.

00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:49,420
Given the force needed
to cause this type of damage,

00:13:49,487 --> 00:13:51,055
the injury's more consistent

00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:54,626
with inflicted
blunt force trauma
than a simple fall,

00:13:54,692 --> 00:13:56,427
if that's what you're asking.

00:13:57,762 --> 00:14:01,099
Arsenic is the active ingredient
in the vineyard pesticide,

00:14:01,165 --> 00:14:03,568
but you're ruling it out
as the source of the poisoning?

00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:06,004
The pesticide is
a copper-arsenate mix.

00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:07,105
It's chemically different

00:14:07,171 --> 00:14:09,273
than the arsenic
ingested by Ms. Stern.

00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,142
And, FYI, that pesticide

00:14:11,209 --> 00:14:13,277
was outlawed by
the EPA years ago.

00:14:13,344 --> 00:14:15,513
This guy is
poisoning the soil.

00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,615
So he's not a killer,
he's a polluter.

00:14:17,682 --> 00:14:19,384
He should still be arrested,
if you ask me.

00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:21,185
People are saying that

00:14:21,252 --> 00:14:23,087
you found urine
in the vic's stomach.

00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:25,890
Not sure if it's
hinky or kinky.

00:14:27,692 --> 00:14:29,360
When I used to play ball
for the Stars,

00:14:29,427 --> 00:14:32,063
we would pee on our palms
during spring training

00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:33,698
to toughen them up,
you know.

00:14:33,765 --> 00:14:37,101
Remind me never
to shake your hand.

00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:39,470
I'll put on a glove first.

00:14:39,537 --> 00:14:42,173
That's always a good idea.

00:14:46,444 --> 00:14:47,478
Just came from Tox.

00:14:47,545 --> 00:14:50,381
Rory Kendell's urine
analysis is still pending.

00:14:50,448 --> 00:14:51,716
I know we're not
supposed to get

00:14:51,783 --> 00:14:53,918
ahead of the evidence here,
but if he's not guilty...

00:14:53,985 --> 00:14:56,120
I lifted several prints
off the clamps

00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:57,722
you found by the open window.

00:14:57,789 --> 00:14:59,290
I AFIS-matched them
to a neighbor.

00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:01,826
The guy's on file
for a D&amp;D in '82.

00:15:01,893 --> 00:15:03,027
It's Rory, right.

00:15:03,094 --> 00:15:04,796
No. Zach Alfano.

00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:05,830
Who?

00:15:05,897 --> 00:15:07,198
He's the neighbor
on the other side.

00:15:07,265 --> 00:15:08,232
I called his house.

00:15:08,299 --> 00:15:09,801
His daughter said
he was picked up

00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,235
in an ambulance two days ago.

00:15:11,302 --> 00:15:12,437
Apparently, he was vomiting,

00:15:12,503 --> 00:15:14,005
he couldn't breathe,
he passed out.

00:15:14,072 --> 00:15:16,140
Brass is taking a statement.

00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:18,409
He's still in the hospital.

00:15:18,476 --> 00:15:21,112
BRASS:
So why didn't you
contact the police?

00:15:21,179 --> 00:15:22,647
I had... ( <i>clears throat</i> )

00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:25,149
( <i>speaking hoarsely</i> ):
I had a tube down my throat
till a half hour ago.

00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:26,951
All right, let me
get this straight--

00:15:27,018 --> 00:15:29,287
so you came in from a run
and then what happened?

00:15:29,354 --> 00:15:31,789
I heard screaming
from inside the house.

00:15:31,856 --> 00:15:34,292
( <i>screaming</i> )

00:15:38,329 --> 00:15:42,300
<i>By the time I got to Beckman,</i>
<i>he'd already passed out.</i>

00:15:42,367 --> 00:15:45,303
<i>I started to choke on the gas,</i>

00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:48,339
<i>so I got out of there.</i>

00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:51,309
<i>Ran to my neighbor's house,</i>
<i>Rory Kendell's, for help.</i>

00:15:51,376 --> 00:15:52,577
( <i>doorbell rings</i> )

00:15:55,847 --> 00:15:58,816
I remember my daughter
calling 911.

00:15:58,883 --> 00:16:01,052
Next thing I know...

00:16:01,119 --> 00:16:02,720
I'm here.

00:16:02,787 --> 00:16:04,322
( <i>coughs</i> )

00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,689
The print on the doorbell
is a match to Zach,

00:16:37,755 --> 00:16:39,324
and I found vomit
in the bushes.

00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:41,426
Both support his account.

00:16:41,492 --> 00:16:42,560
Sara?

00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:44,595
We missed something.

00:16:44,662 --> 00:16:45,697
What?

00:16:45,763 --> 00:16:47,098
The directionality
of the floor rug.

00:16:47,165 --> 00:16:48,733
The center of the rug

00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,902
is pointing towards
the side window.

00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:54,706
<i>Also confirms</i>
<i>Zach Alfano's story.</i>

00:16:54,772 --> 00:16:56,407
We're back to Rory Kendell.

00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:58,710
If he didn't leave
the house for two days,

00:16:58,776 --> 00:17:00,144
how come he didn't
answer the door

00:17:00,211 --> 00:17:01,879
when Zach Alfano rang the bell?

00:17:01,946 --> 00:17:03,948
I was sick.

00:17:04,015 --> 00:17:06,651
I figured it was some
Girl Scout selling cookies.

00:17:06,718 --> 00:17:09,120
We got back the results
of your urine analysis.

00:17:09,187 --> 00:17:11,990
There was sulfuryl
fluoride in your system.

00:17:12,056 --> 00:17:13,591
You were at Elliot's house.

00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:15,093
No.

00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,728
Here's a thought--

00:17:16,794 --> 00:17:19,263
after the exterminators left,
you met up with Elliot.

00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:21,065
You had a fight,
you knocked him out,

00:17:21,132 --> 00:17:22,700
and you dragged him
into the house

00:17:22,767 --> 00:17:23,701
through the side window.

00:17:23,768 --> 00:17:25,770
You figured the fumigation
would cover your tracks,

00:17:25,837 --> 00:17:27,639
that we'd chalk it up
to an accident.

00:17:27,705 --> 00:17:29,941
Why would I want
to kill Elliot?

00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:32,543
You've had five noise complaints
against him last year.

00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:34,078
That's hardly reason
to kill somebody.

00:17:34,145 --> 00:17:35,813
Or is it a reason
to commit assault?

00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,949
He filed charges
against you last May.

00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:39,951
I knocked on his door,

00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:42,587
and I asked him to turn down
that classical crap.

00:17:42,654 --> 00:17:44,389
He refused.

00:17:44,455 --> 00:17:46,958
I overreacted.

00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:48,192
I apologized.

00:17:48,259 --> 00:17:51,296
Charges were dropped.

00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:52,463
I swear.

00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:55,133
Save the swearing for trial.
You're under arrest.

00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,834
( <i>coughs</i> )

00:17:58,903 --> 00:18:01,572
DR. ROBBINS:
<i>Renita Loakes, 38,</i>
<i>from Seven Hills.</i>

00:18:01,639 --> 00:18:02,774
<i>New case.</i>

00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,742
<i>Started as a routine autopsy.</i>

00:18:04,809 --> 00:18:06,978
<i>She was shopping</i>
<i>at the Venetian,</i>

00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:08,680
<i>keeled over at Lacoste.</i>

00:18:08,746 --> 00:18:11,215
<i>Physically, she was</i>
<i>in excellent condition,</i>

00:18:11,282 --> 00:18:13,718
<i>so I figured spontaneous</i>
<i>aortic dissection</i>

00:18:13,785 --> 00:18:16,521
<i>or maybe pulmonary embolism.</i>

00:18:16,587 --> 00:18:17,989
Then I noticed Mees Lines.

00:18:21,826 --> 00:18:24,662
Ah... just like
Julie Stern.

00:18:30,601 --> 00:18:33,738
<i>I spotted the tiny pinpricks</i>
<i>on her face,</i>

00:18:33,805 --> 00:18:35,974
<i>so I painted her</i>
<i>with Toluidine Blue</i>

00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,742
<i>to highlight the marks.</i>

00:18:40,278 --> 00:18:42,480
Have a look at this.

00:18:42,547 --> 00:18:44,916
Now check out Renita's face.

00:18:56,928 --> 00:18:58,363
An exact match.

00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:00,131
It's an acupuncture facial

00:19:00,198 --> 00:19:03,901
<i>designed to reduce</i>
<i>the signs of aging.</i>

00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:15,580

<i>in the space of two days,</i>

00:19:17,315 --> 00:19:19,584
<i>I found urine</i>
<i>in the decedent's stomach.</i>

00:19:19,651 --> 00:19:21,519
That's more than a coincidence.

00:19:21,586 --> 00:19:23,021
Two women,

00:19:23,087 --> 00:19:28,192
both fighting the toll of time,
die prematurely.

00:19:28,259 --> 00:19:30,595
Why?

00:19:35,792 --> 00:19:37,260
This is Renita's apartment.

00:19:37,934 --> 00:19:38,855
Thanks.
You bet.

00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,920

00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:08,627
I just got back
from the Four Aces.

00:32:08,694 --> 00:32:11,363
The hotel manager said Elliot
tried to check in with his bird.

00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,766
The guy turned him down
because he didn't have a cage,

00:32:13,832 --> 00:32:16,669
so supposedly Elliot went home
to retrieve it,

00:32:16,735 --> 00:32:19,338
but neither he
nor the bird ever returned.

00:32:19,405 --> 00:32:23,442
Looks like we need
to find that bird.

00:32:35,487 --> 00:32:38,490
( <i>flies buzzing</i> )

00:32:40,826 --> 00:32:42,594
Greg.

00:32:44,163 --> 00:32:46,398
( <i>flies buzzing</i> )

00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:48,367
Oh.

00:32:48,434 --> 00:32:50,869
There were no flies in here
when we processed the house.

00:32:50,936 --> 00:32:55,107
Fumigation kills
all household insects,

00:32:55,174 --> 00:32:59,311
and it takes time for new flies
to find a portal of entry.

00:33:00,746 --> 00:33:02,514
( <i>sniffing</i> )

00:33:02,581 --> 00:33:04,917
Well, bird could've flown
up somewhere and died.

00:33:06,618 --> 00:33:08,420
( <i>flies buzzing</i> )

00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:32,344
Carcass with a fresh
colony of maggots.

00:33:32,411 --> 00:33:33,345
( <i>clearing throat</i> )

00:33:33,412 --> 00:33:35,314
The bird's not here;
it's a dead rat.

00:33:35,381 --> 00:33:37,850
Which means the macaw
was either birdknapped

00:33:37,916 --> 00:33:39,885
or he flew the coop.

00:33:42,083 --> 00:33:43,451
MAN ( <i>singsong voice</i> ):
I love you.

00:33:43,518 --> 00:33:46,888
I love you, I love you...
I love you.

00:33:46,955 --> 00:33:48,523
( <i>clucks tongue</i> )

00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:50,959
( <i>whistling</i> )

00:33:51,542 --> 00:33:54,645
I love you.
I love you.

00:33:55,583 --> 00:33:57,118
I love you.

00:33:57,185 --> 00:33:58,458
Teaching him to speak?

00:33:58,458 --> 00:34:01,394
Although the cockatoo is
intelligent,

00:34:01,461 --> 00:34:02,896
birds don't <i>speak.</i>

00:34:02,963 --> 00:34:05,365
To speak requires
a cognitive ability

00:34:05,432 --> 00:34:08,768
to understand,
which they don't.

00:34:08,835 --> 00:34:10,437
They just imitate.

00:34:10,503 --> 00:34:12,439
And Edweena is a she.

00:34:12,505 --> 00:34:14,341
How can I help you?

00:34:14,407 --> 00:34:17,777
I'm looking for a macaw.

00:34:17,844 --> 00:34:19,779
Well, you came to
the right place.

00:34:19,846 --> 00:34:22,949
Buy Buy Birdie's the only exotic
bird store in Clark County.

00:34:23,016 --> 00:34:25,685
Has anyone tried to sell you
a macaw in the last few days?

00:34:25,752 --> 00:34:27,187
No. Why?

00:34:27,254 --> 00:34:29,756
Well, I'm trying to locate
a missing Blue Hyacinth.

00:34:29,823 --> 00:34:30,957
Very rare.

00:34:31,024 --> 00:34:34,060
In my whole career,
I've only sold one.

00:34:34,127 --> 00:34:36,029
Do you remember
the buyer's name?

00:34:36,096 --> 00:34:37,430
Sure. Mr. Beckman.

00:34:37,497 --> 00:34:39,199
He's in here
all the time.

00:34:39,266 --> 00:34:41,301
Bob likes to eat cashews
out of my pocket.

00:34:41,368 --> 00:34:43,870
Mr. Beckman doesn't go
anywhere without Bob.

00:34:43,937 --> 00:34:49,643
Mr. Beckman, um,
died three days ago.

00:34:49,709 --> 00:34:52,078
We found these...

00:34:52,145 --> 00:34:55,882
feathers in his house.

00:34:55,949 --> 00:34:57,317
Tail feathers.

00:34:57,384 --> 00:34:58,985
That's not good.

00:34:59,052 --> 00:35:00,820
Why is that?

00:35:00,887 --> 00:35:02,455
Macaws only molt
one tail feather at a time.

00:35:02,522 --> 00:35:06,393
Get a pile like this,
someone yanked.

00:35:06,459 --> 00:35:08,428
Real hard.

00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:12,499
So, Dr. Malaga was telling
the truth--

00:35:12,565 --> 00:35:13,967
both women
were poisoned.

00:35:14,034 --> 00:35:15,936
But that's not
what killed them.

00:35:16,002 --> 00:35:19,739
Yeah, so we can rule out
arsenic as a cause of death.

00:35:19,806 --> 00:35:21,207
Hey, Travis?

00:35:21,274 --> 00:35:24,344
These are the vials from
our decedents, right?

00:35:24,411 --> 00:35:27,347
Yeah, I just finished
with them yesterday.

00:35:27,414 --> 00:35:30,050
Why?

00:35:30,116 --> 00:35:31,518
Well, the red blood cells

00:35:31,585 --> 00:35:33,253
haven't separated
from the serum.

00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,788
Is that relevant?

00:35:34,854 --> 00:35:38,124
Maybe.
I mean, normally,

00:35:38,191 --> 00:35:40,927
we'd see a yellow band of serum
on top of the crimson blood.

00:35:40,994 --> 00:35:43,496
These vials are solid crimson.

00:35:43,563 --> 00:35:46,166
Which means the red blood cells
have lysed.

00:35:46,232 --> 00:35:49,636
<i>Something caused the red blood</i>
<i>cells to lyse, or pop.</i>

00:35:49,703 --> 00:35:52,172
<i>The hemoglobin</i>
<i>from inside those cells</i>

00:35:52,238 --> 00:35:53,673
<i>infiltrated the serum.</i>

00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:57,477
If a sufficient number
of red blood cells lyse,

00:35:57,544 --> 00:35:58,645
a person dies.

00:35:58,712 --> 00:36:00,614
So, what caused the lysis?

00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:03,783
We answer that question,
we solve this case.

00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:05,919
CATHERINE:
So, the women were 30 years
apart in age.

00:36:05,986 --> 00:36:07,721
They lived on different
sides of town.

00:36:07,787 --> 00:36:09,489
They probably didn't know
each other.

00:36:09,556 --> 00:36:11,491
But they both drank
their own urine

00:36:11,558 --> 00:36:13,026
and were patients
of Dr. Malaga's.

00:36:13,093 --> 00:36:14,928
Well, were either one
of their procedures

00:36:14,995 --> 00:36:17,330
sufficiently invasive as
to compromise their blood?

00:36:17,397 --> 00:36:20,533
Well, last Monday,
two days before

00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:23,703
liver spot removal,
Ms. Stern had

00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:27,874
a body wrap and...
hydrogen peroxide therapy.

00:36:27,941 --> 00:36:30,944
Ms. Loakes also underwent
hydrogen peroxide therapy...

00:36:31,011 --> 00:36:32,312
on the same day?

00:36:32,379 --> 00:36:35,348
Here's the menu
of services

00:36:35,415 --> 00:36:37,183
provided by the spa.

00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:38,585
Let's see...

00:36:38,652 --> 00:36:40,687
"Hydrogen Peroxide Therapy--
a three percent solution

00:36:40,754 --> 00:36:43,089
"is injected directly into
a client's vein,

00:36:43,156 --> 00:36:45,258
"bathing the red blood cells
in nourishing oxygen,

00:36:45,325 --> 00:36:46,927
"boosting the immune system

00:36:46,993 --> 00:36:49,029
and reversing the signs
of aging."

00:36:49,095 --> 00:36:51,598
Question is, is it deadly?

00:36:51,665 --> 00:36:54,100
Well, let's find out.
I'll get the hydrogen peroxide.

00:36:54,167 --> 00:36:55,502
I'll get the blood.

00:36:55,568 --> 00:36:57,537
Okay.

00:37:37,577 --> 00:37:39,779
( <i>knocking on door</i> )

00:37:41,481 --> 00:37:43,049
( <i>clears throat</i> )

00:37:44,784 --> 00:37:48,388
Mr. Martin, we have a warrant
to search your apartment.

00:37:48,455 --> 00:37:50,190
Please, stay with me.

00:37:50,257 --> 00:37:52,058
Stay ahead of me.

00:37:54,294 --> 00:37:56,496
Look, if you guys tell me
what you're looking for,

00:37:56,563 --> 00:37:58,698
maybe I can
help you out, um...

00:37:58,765 --> 00:38:00,967
Look, shut up and stay still.

00:38:17,217 --> 00:38:18,618
Brass?

00:38:18,685 --> 00:38:20,620
How many watches do you own?

00:38:20,687 --> 00:38:22,756
Couple of sport,
couple of dress.

00:38:22,822 --> 00:38:23,990
Why?

00:38:24,057 --> 00:38:25,992
Mr. Martin has about 20 here.

00:38:26,059 --> 00:38:26,993
Twenty?

00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,261
I'm a collector.

00:38:28,328 --> 00:38:31,564
This is a little small for
your wrist, don't you think?

00:38:35,535 --> 00:38:38,538
Several rings, a necklace,
cufflinks

00:38:38,605 --> 00:38:39,940
and a gold pen.

00:38:40,006 --> 00:38:42,375
You know, these things all have
one thing in common--

00:38:42,442 --> 00:38:44,344
you can kind of slip them
into your pocket.

00:38:44,411 --> 00:38:47,480
This is engraved--
"Joan Arryington."

00:38:47,547 --> 00:38:49,049
I wonder what the odds are

00:38:49,115 --> 00:38:52,385
that Mrs. Arryington is a client
of Oden Pest Control.

00:38:55,555 --> 00:38:58,291
( <i>squawking</i> )

00:39:08,768 --> 00:39:11,071
Hello, Bob.

00:39:11,137 --> 00:39:12,572
BOB:
Hello, Bob.

00:39:16,376 --> 00:39:18,211
Look what I found.

00:39:18,278 --> 00:39:20,647
( <i>Bob squawks</i> )

00:39:20,714 --> 00:39:22,882
I think we all know
what happened here.

00:39:22,949 --> 00:39:24,918
After your buddies
left, you were
poking around

00:39:24,985 --> 00:39:26,186
Mr. Beckman's house.

00:39:26,253 --> 00:39:27,587
But he surprised you.

00:39:30,924 --> 00:39:33,627
( <i>murmuring</i> ):
A cage! I can't believe
that manager.

00:39:35,895 --> 00:39:38,164
What the hell are you doing?
Just getting ready
for the fume.

00:39:38,231 --> 00:39:40,333
You were rifling
through my stuff...
No, no, no, no, man.

00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,036
I was just making sure that
everything, uh, was, is secure.

00:39:43,103 --> 00:39:44,738
I'm going to call the police.

00:39:44,804 --> 00:39:45,805
( <i>squawks</i> )

00:39:45,872 --> 00:39:47,307
( <i>muttering</i> ):
He can't do that.

00:39:47,374 --> 00:39:48,375
No, he can't.

00:39:50,443 --> 00:39:52,078
( <i>grunts</i> )

00:40:03,023 --> 00:40:04,691
( <i>squawks</i> )

00:40:04,758 --> 00:40:07,961
Somehow, you managed to get
the bird in the cage,

00:40:08,028 --> 00:40:10,430
seal the tent
and release the gas.

00:40:10,497 --> 00:40:11,698
( <i>valve squeaks</i> )

00:40:11,765 --> 00:40:13,233
( <i>gas whooshing</i> )

00:40:17,037 --> 00:40:19,973
( <i>choking</i> )

00:40:21,975 --> 00:40:24,978
( <i>grunting and choking</i> )

00:40:29,849 --> 00:40:31,451
( <i>gas whooshing</i> )

00:40:31,518 --> 00:40:34,287
( <i>moaning</i> )

00:40:34,354 --> 00:40:37,157
Despite his neighbor's
best efforts, he was a goner.

00:40:37,223 --> 00:40:38,992
I'm not admitting to anything.

00:40:39,059 --> 00:40:40,760
You don't have to, Ted.

00:40:40,827 --> 00:40:43,296
We know why
the caged bird sings.

00:40:47,167 --> 00:40:48,335
So, hand me the syringe

00:40:48,401 --> 00:40:50,337
with the three percent
concentration.

00:40:50,403 --> 00:40:52,138
Here you go.

00:41:01,381 --> 00:41:03,083
No effect.

00:41:03,149 --> 00:41:06,253
STOKES:
Upping the concentration

00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:10,457
of hydrogen peroxide to...
seven percent.

00:41:24,404 --> 00:41:26,306
Okay.

00:41:44,357 --> 00:41:47,827
Concentration level 30%.

00:41:55,368 --> 00:41:57,304
( <i>popping</i> )

00:41:57,370 --> 00:41:59,506
( <i>whooshing</i> )

00:41:59,572 --> 00:42:01,709
Lysis.

00:42:01,709 --> 00:42:03,177
Concentration at 30%.

00:42:03,244 --> 00:42:06,709
That's ten times the three
percent specified on the menu.

00:42:06,709 --> 00:42:09,512
The death was in the decimal.

00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:12,000
Dr. Malaga has
not committed a crime.

00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,625
He injected a lethal
batch of hydrogen peroxide
into two of his patients.

00:42:16,625 --> 00:42:18,661
Even if that were true,
you may have uncovered

00:42:18,727 --> 00:42:21,208
a very tragic accident,
a very horrible mistake--

00:42:21,208 --> 00:42:23,643
but certainly nothing criminal,
or we'd be downtown right now.

00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:25,478
No A.D.A.'s going
to prosecute.

00:42:25,545 --> 00:42:26,792
The procedures
were elective.

00:42:26,792 --> 00:42:28,041
Catherine, you don't need me
to tell you

00:42:28,041 --> 00:42:29,625
how many people die
every day as a result

00:42:29,625 --> 00:42:32,194
of physician error.
Well, I am not talking
about other people.

00:42:32,261 --> 00:42:34,263
I'm talking about Julie
Stern and Renita Loakes.

00:42:34,330 --> 00:42:36,765
Yeah, both of whom
looked in the mirror...

00:42:36,832 --> 00:42:38,500
and wanted
to turn back time.

00:42:38,567 --> 00:42:41,583
They put their trust in you
because you're an M.D.

00:42:41,583 --> 00:42:43,818
Your professional degree
made them feel safe.

00:42:43,885 --> 00:42:45,920
All procedures carry a risk.

00:42:45,987 --> 00:42:48,056
Is that what you tell yourself?

00:42:48,123 --> 00:42:50,875
And when you
screw up again,

00:42:50,875 --> 00:42:52,125
what happens?

00:42:52,125 --> 00:42:54,227
His malpractice
premiums go up.
Oh.

00:42:54,959 --> 00:42:57,595
I'll be notifying
the victims' families.

00:42:57,662 --> 00:42:59,764
You can count on a civil suit.

00:43:07,238 --> 00:43:08,740
Hi.

00:43:08,806 --> 00:43:09,709
( <i>whispers</i> ):
Hi.
