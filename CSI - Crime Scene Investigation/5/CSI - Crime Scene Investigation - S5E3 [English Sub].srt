Everything all right, Sybil?

00:00:36,035 --> 00:00:36,583
I'm fine.

00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:37,884
What's taking Alicia so long?

00:00:37,951 --> 00:00:39,986
We have a doctor's
appointment in 40 minutes.

00:00:40,053 --> 00:00:41,221
She's not here.

00:00:41,288 --> 00:00:42,255
She has to be.

00:00:42,322 --> 00:00:43,890
I saw her leave for school
this morning.

00:00:43,957 --> 00:00:46,193
Alicia hasn't been in
any of her classes.

April, get off the phone.
I can't talk right now.

00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:52,052
Somebody took Alicia!

00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:56,801
What did you do?!

00:00:56,868 --> 00:00:59,070
What the hell
did you do?!

00:00:59,137 --> 00:01:00,583
Mom, I don't know...

00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:01,375
Where is she?!

00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:03,210
I'm not sure.
Where is she?!

00:01:03,277 --> 00:01:04,412
Get off of me!

00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:07,949
Go find my daughter!
Go find my daughter!

00:01:08,015 --> 00:01:11,218
I don't get to see Alicia
all that much.

00:01:11,285 --> 00:01:13,250
Um, I don't get to.

00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:16,667
Her life sucks, so sometimes

00:01:16,667 --> 00:01:17,875
she would just, you know,
play hooky

00:01:17,875 --> 00:01:19,333
and spend the day with me.

00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:21,902
After girls' day out, you
stopped here for a snack.

Your father?

00:01:26,473 --> 00:01:28,083
Yeah. Um...

00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:29,518
I was just went in, and...

00:01:29,585 --> 00:01:31,020
you know, to get something

00:01:31,086 --> 00:01:33,322
while she changed back
into her uniform.

00:01:33,389 --> 00:01:34,623
In the car?
It's not that
big of a deal.

00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:38,041
It's like, you know, the
skirt over the jeans,
and back to school

00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:39,976
before Mom knows anything

00:01:40,043 --> 00:01:41,375
So what did he look like?

00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:43,083
What kind of car
did he drive?

00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:44,084
Alicia!

00:01:45,419 --> 00:01:47,388
A black guy, uh...

00:01:47,454 --> 00:01:48,589
He had a beard

00:01:48,655 --> 00:01:51,225
and he had a crappy black Buick.

00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:52,659
But, um...

00:01:52,726 --> 00:01:54,328
I don't know, maybe it was blue.

00:01:54,395 --> 00:01:56,397
( <i>screaming</i> )

00:01:56,463 --> 00:01:59,266
I don't really...

00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:00,834
No, that's... that's good.

00:02:00,901 --> 00:02:02,703
You did good.
That's good.
Thank you.
Okay.

00:02:11,545 --> 00:02:13,147
The cops won't tell us.

00:02:13,213 --> 00:02:16,417
What are the chances
of finding our daughter?

00:02:16,483 --> 00:02:17,451
We're doing everything we can.

00:02:17,518 --> 00:02:18,719
That's what everyone
keeps saying.

00:02:18,786 --> 00:02:20,187
No one will
tell us anything.

00:02:20,254 --> 00:02:21,455
Did you injure yourself,

00:02:21,522 --> 00:02:22,923
Mrs. Perez?

00:02:24,858 --> 00:02:26,460
Oh, a nosebleed.

00:02:26,527 --> 00:02:28,095
That's a lot of blood.

00:02:28,162 --> 00:02:29,596
I'm going to need

00:02:29,663 --> 00:02:30,964
to take your shirt.

00:02:31,632 --> 00:02:33,267
Why?
If you like,

00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:34,935
I can have someone
follow you home

00:02:35,002 --> 00:02:36,103
so that you can change.

00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,771
You think we had
something to do with it?

00:02:37,838 --> 00:02:39,106
Our daughter

00:02:39,173 --> 00:02:40,274
is missing.

00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,409
She's out there somewhere
alone and scared.

What are you doing
about that?!

00:02:44,011 --> 00:02:45,212
I'm just collecting evidence.

Fine.

An Amber Alert has been issued

Rusty.

They say I have a flinch.

00:03:57,709 --> 00:03:59,978
You and I need
to go practice some, huh?

00:04:00,044 --> 00:04:02,180
Yeah, when do we have
time to do that?

00:04:02,247 --> 00:04:04,048
If we're not processing
a scene or working evidence,

00:04:04,115 --> 00:04:05,216
we're in court.

00:04:05,283 --> 00:04:06,851
Well, when they take your piece,
you'll make time.

00:04:06,918 --> 00:04:07,852
This girl seemed

00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:09,787
a little old to be lured
by a lost puppy.

00:04:09,854 --> 00:04:11,256
So how'd this guy
pull this off

00:04:11,322 --> 00:04:12,290
in a lot this public?

00:04:12,357 --> 00:04:15,126
Easy. With a map and a smile.

"Hey, little girl, I'm lost.

00:04:17,428 --> 00:04:18,696
You from around here?"

She gets close enough

00:04:20,098 --> 00:04:22,667
he pulls her out
of her sister's car,
into his car...

00:04:22,734 --> 00:04:23,835
Bam, she's done.

00:04:23,902 --> 00:04:25,203
I bet he had a weapon.

00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,704
Threatened her,
so he could drive.

00:04:26,771 --> 00:04:28,339
Probably used his fists.

00:04:29,207 --> 00:04:30,808
Bastard had to have hit her.

00:04:35,346 --> 00:04:38,049
Look, dude, I didn't see it.

00:04:38,116 --> 00:04:43,688
Chica had a nice, round ass
and that's what I was scoping.

00:04:43,755 --> 00:04:45,023
What time was that?

00:04:45,089 --> 00:04:46,024
About 3:00.

00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:48,026
She comes in, grabs some candy,

00:04:48,092 --> 00:04:51,329
looks outside,
waves at somebody.

00:04:51,396 --> 00:04:54,065
The next thing I know,
she flips her wig.

00:04:54,132 --> 00:04:56,234
She's screaming
about her sister.

00:04:56,301 --> 00:04:58,603
I didn't see the girl or a car.

00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:01,239
Besides, there's a lot
of traffic out there.

00:05:01,306 --> 00:05:02,373
Was it busy?

00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,608
Kind of.

00:05:03,675 --> 00:05:05,777
How many surveillance cameras
do you have in here?

00:05:05,844 --> 00:05:08,112
Inside we got five.

00:05:08,179 --> 00:05:10,215
They're all state-of-the-art.

Place gets hit a lot.

00:05:12,684 --> 00:05:14,552
Outside they're all dummies.

00:05:27,398 --> 00:05:29,300
What?

00:05:29,367 --> 00:05:31,569
Nick, you failed firearms
qualification.

00:05:31,636 --> 00:05:32,637
You can't be here.

Oh, yeah. Well,

day after tomorrow,

00:05:35,106 --> 00:05:37,141

Not in the field.

00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:38,543
You're serious?

00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:40,912
You're in violation just

Uh, Nick, let me catch
a lift with you.

00:05:51,489 --> 00:05:53,157

Now, kids this age,

Mouthing off
to teachers,

slipping grades
and now hitchhiking.

00:06:29,861 --> 00:06:31,829
I mean, what is next, Lindsey?

00:06:31,896 --> 00:06:34,165
Stripping.

00:06:34,232 --> 00:06:35,466
What did you just say?

Whatever.

to make it two?

00:06:49,172 --> 00:06:50,774
Dad always said
you were a drama queen.

Well, what do you expect,
Lindsey,

00:06:52,642 --> 00:06:53,977
since he was always high.

00:06:54,044 --> 00:06:55,378
I'd take Dad high

00:06:55,445 --> 00:06:57,681
over you any day!

You paged.

Yeah.

00:07:08,525 --> 00:07:10,393
What's missing?

00:07:13,863 --> 00:07:15,165
I give up.

Her sister said the victim
changed back

00:07:17,667 --> 00:07:19,836
into her school uniform
in the car.

00:07:19,903 --> 00:07:22,539
So? Where are the clothes
she changed out of?

Welcome.

00:07:28,578 --> 00:07:30,180
Look, I already know you have
a running bet

00:07:30,246 --> 00:07:32,148
with another CSI over how long
the new hire lasts,

00:07:32,215 --> 00:07:33,550
so let's skip it.

00:07:33,616 --> 00:07:35,251
You got something
for DNA?

00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,588
The mother's
bloody T-shirt.

00:07:38,655 --> 00:07:39,589
Exemplar?

00:07:39,656 --> 00:07:40,724
It's on its way.

00:07:45,795 --> 00:07:47,697
Just hedging my bets.

00:07:47,764 --> 00:07:49,065
How so?
Well, I need

00:07:49,132 --> 00:07:50,834
field experience,
but before I get that,

00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,202
I need to find a replacement.

00:07:52,268 --> 00:07:53,737
So far, I'm o-for-one.

00:07:53,803 --> 00:07:57,507
Plus, she's hot
and thinks you're a tool,

00:07:57,574 --> 00:07:59,209
so I'm way ahead.

How about a housekeeper
or a maid?

00:08:09,819 --> 00:08:10,754
I do it.

00:08:12,022 --> 00:08:13,656
your daughter's routines.

00:08:13,723 --> 00:08:15,759
Her routes to and from school,

00:08:15,825 --> 00:08:19,229
any extra-curricular activities,
a list of friends.

00:08:19,295 --> 00:08:20,997
There wasn't any
after school stuff.

00:08:21,064 --> 00:08:22,165
Alicia isn't a joiner.

00:08:22,232 --> 00:08:24,601
She walks to school,
I pick her up. That's it.

00:08:24,668 --> 00:08:26,936
How often did April get
her sister to skip school?

00:08:29,706 --> 00:08:30,640
We don't know.

00:08:30,707 --> 00:08:31,908
We... we just
found out ourselves.

00:08:31,975 --> 00:08:32,942
I'm curious because

00:08:33,009 --> 00:08:37,213
April said she hardly
ever gets to see Alicia.

00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,115
Why didn't she
just come here?

00:08:39,182 --> 00:08:40,917
Because she wasn't welcome.

00:08:41,785 --> 00:08:42,986
We kicked her out.

00:08:43,053 --> 00:08:44,421
April's a troubled girl.

00:08:44,487 --> 00:08:46,456
Problems with drugs,
the police.

00:08:47,957 --> 00:08:49,592
You might
as well know,

00:08:49,659 --> 00:08:52,295
she also did some time.
Juvenile lockup.

00:08:52,362 --> 00:08:53,296
For what?

00:08:53,363 --> 00:08:56,299
Heroin possession.
Intent to distribute.

00:08:56,366 --> 00:08:59,169
There's nothing
suspicious on the server.

00:08:59,235 --> 00:09:01,304
Only hits
are music downloads.

00:09:01,371 --> 00:09:03,106
Wait a minute.

00:09:03,173 --> 00:09:04,541
An organ transplant site.

00:09:04,607 --> 00:09:05,675
For kidneys, heart,

00:09:05,742 --> 00:09:07,077
lungs and liver.

00:09:07,143 --> 00:09:08,611
What is that, homework research?

00:09:08,678 --> 00:09:10,113
Maybe. These are
pretty detailed

00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,681
biochem and immunosuppressant

00:09:11,748 --> 00:09:12,949
citations.

00:09:13,016 --> 00:09:14,317
It's a little over

00:09:14,384 --> 00:09:16,186
a seventh grader's head,
don't you think?

00:09:16,252 --> 00:09:17,187
I don't know.

00:09:17,253 --> 00:09:19,389
I bet you were a pretty smart
seventh grader.

00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,570
She has a serious crush
on a boy named Jimmy Jones.

00:09:40,076 --> 00:09:42,145
Sara.

00:09:43,613 --> 00:09:46,816
"I hate Mom &amp; Dad."

00:09:48,118 --> 00:09:49,586
Who doesn't once in a while?

00:09:53,456 --> 00:09:54,858
Daniel Perez.

00:09:54,924 --> 00:09:56,226
And you are...?

00:09:56,292 --> 00:09:57,494
Gil Grissom, Sara Sidle,

00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,795
Las Vegas Crime Lab.

00:09:58,862 --> 00:09:59,863
I guess that's why

00:09:59,929 --> 00:10:01,898
you're pawing through
my sister's private stuff.

00:10:01,965 --> 00:10:03,166
It's going to help
us find her.

00:10:03,233 --> 00:10:05,568
Do you know a Jimmy Jones?

00:10:05,635 --> 00:10:06,369
Yeah, a boy from school.

00:10:06,436 --> 00:10:07,370
She liked him.

00:10:07,437 --> 00:10:08,705
GRISSOM:
What's your
sister like?

00:10:08,772 --> 00:10:12,475
Personable, friendly,
outgoing, trusting, maybe?

00:10:12,542 --> 00:10:16,379
She's a giver--
from the day she was born.

00:10:17,414 --> 00:10:21,484
Uh, Daniel... you're bleeding.

00:10:21,551 --> 00:10:24,220
I'm sorry.

00:10:25,288 --> 00:10:26,690
You want to know my sister,

00:10:26,756 --> 00:10:29,292
you should check her diary
under the mattress.

00:10:44,674 --> 00:10:46,710
"Last night
I didn't sleep very good.

00:10:46,776 --> 00:10:48,712
I kept thinking
about the surgery."

00:10:48,778 --> 00:10:51,581
I guess we know why she
was doing transplant research.

00:10:53,016 --> 00:10:55,885
Serious illness takes
a toll on a family.

00:10:57,354 --> 00:10:58,621
Alicia never complained.

00:11:00,023 --> 00:11:01,591
She's used to the doctors.

00:11:01,658 --> 00:11:03,026
She has friends there--

00:11:03,093 --> 00:11:06,096
people who understand--
go through the same hell.

00:11:06,162 --> 00:11:07,998
You know, if a victim
has a serious illness,

00:11:08,064 --> 00:11:09,799
you really should
disclose it right away.

00:11:09,866 --> 00:11:12,235
Our daughter isn't sick.

00:11:12,302 --> 00:11:15,038
Our son's kidneys are failing.

00:11:15,105 --> 00:11:17,107
Alicia is his matching donor.

00:11:17,173 --> 00:11:19,976
Without her, he'd die.

00:11:23,667 --> 00:11:25,000
Well, Alicia was
a great half-back--

00:11:25,001 --> 00:11:27,125
strong right leg,
aggressive.

00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:28,994
You don't see that
too much in girls.

00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,083
WILLOWS:
She played soccer?

00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:31,017
Yeah, for awhile.

00:11:31,084 --> 00:11:32,786
She quit before she got cut.

00:11:32,852 --> 00:11:34,688
She missed a lot
of practice
'cause she was

00:11:34,754 --> 00:11:36,690
always going to the doctor,
and you can't really play

00:11:36,756 --> 00:11:38,291
with one kidney
anyway, so...

00:11:38,358 --> 00:11:40,026
She told you about her brother?

00:11:40,093 --> 00:11:41,194
Yeah, on the way to school.

00:11:41,261 --> 00:11:42,629
Hell, I thought that it was cool

00:11:42,696 --> 00:11:45,198
that she was saving his life,
but she seemed pretty pissed.

00:11:45,265 --> 00:11:47,300
Jimmy... language.

00:11:47,367 --> 00:11:48,301
Sorry.

00:11:48,368 --> 00:11:50,804
Anyway, uh, she
didn't seem too happy.

00:11:50,871 --> 00:11:53,473
Said she had no life
and never would.

00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,508
BRASS:
So, Jimmy, on your way
to and from school,

00:11:55,575 --> 00:11:58,678
did anyone ever bother you
or approach you in any way?

00:11:58,745 --> 00:11:59,980
Um...

00:12:00,046 --> 00:12:02,082
there was this one guy,
with a track suit,

00:12:02,148 --> 00:12:03,583
he was supposed
to be running.

00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:04,751
He gave me the creeps.

00:12:04,818 --> 00:12:06,119
What gave you the creeps?

00:12:06,186 --> 00:12:07,654
Well, start with his gear.

00:12:07,721 --> 00:12:09,489
I mean, nobody runs in velour.

00:12:09,556 --> 00:12:10,490
And he never had
any water

00:12:10,557 --> 00:12:11,758
and he was always
on the phone.

00:12:11,825 --> 00:12:12,626
What'd he look like?

00:12:12,692 --> 00:12:13,693
Black guy.

00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,429
He was not a runner,
but he was in shape.

00:12:16,496 --> 00:12:17,964
Bald, mustache, beard.

00:12:18,031 --> 00:12:19,666
How old would you say he is,
Jimmy?

00:12:19,733 --> 00:12:22,068
Qld... like 30.

00:12:23,403 --> 00:12:26,606
I just... never liked the way
he looked at Alicia.

00:12:28,575 --> 00:12:30,911
Thanks. You've been a great
help, Jimmy. Thank you.

00:12:30,977 --> 00:12:32,412
Uh, if it's okay with your mom,

00:12:32,479 --> 00:12:34,581
I'm going to have you hang
around, look at some photos.

00:12:34,648 --> 00:12:35,415

where she was taken.

Phew! That's a lot of perverts.

00:12:54,067 --> 00:12:55,769
Get out of jail,
come to Vegas.

00:12:55,835 --> 00:12:58,238
They're listed in tiers
of projected recidivism,

00:12:58,305 --> 00:12:59,272
zero through three.

00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:01,274
Three being the most dangerous.

00:13:01,341 --> 00:13:03,710
They're the ones most likely
to plan an abduction

00:13:03,777 --> 00:13:06,279
and find the privacy
for sexual assault and murder.

00:13:06,346 --> 00:13:07,781
If I remove the zeroes and ones,

00:13:07,847 --> 00:13:10,183
since they have a low
or moderate risk designation,

00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:13,720
this is what we're left with.

00:13:13,787 --> 00:13:15,589
That's still a lot of perverts.

00:13:15,655 --> 00:13:17,190
Mm, maybe not.

00:14:02,903 --> 00:14:05,705
have absolutely no unconditional
release and are under

00:17:21,134 --> 00:17:22,836
after-school programs,
churches...

00:17:22,903 --> 00:17:25,305
We found a pair of boy's
underwear in your bedroom.

00:17:25,372 --> 00:17:26,339
Explain that.

00:17:26,406 --> 00:17:28,842
I look at the photos.

00:17:28,909 --> 00:17:30,877
I look at the photos
and I have the briefs

00:17:30,944 --> 00:17:33,813
for, um...

00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,615

00:17:35,682 --> 00:17:37,183
So you fantasize,

00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,486
and eventually,
the fantasy's not enough

00:17:39,553 --> 00:17:40,854
and you relapse.

00:17:40,921 --> 00:17:42,355
Hey, they're mine.

00:17:42,422 --> 00:17:44,324
I bought the underwear!

00:17:44,391 --> 00:17:46,159
Well, if that's true,
then you were in a store

00:17:46,226 --> 00:17:48,395
where little children were
shopping with their mothers.

00:17:48,461 --> 00:17:50,931
And what would you have me do,
huh, man?

00:17:50,997 --> 00:17:54,568
What?! I mean, I even thought
about chemical castration.

00:17:54,634 --> 00:17:56,670
Medroxyprogesterone is
inconclusive.

00:17:56,736 --> 00:17:59,339
It renders the subject incapable
of erection,

00:17:59,406 --> 00:18:01,474
but it doesn't remove
the sex drive.

00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:04,110
You would still be capable
of sexual assault

00:18:04,177 --> 00:18:05,845

00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,017

Um, I haven't done
anything, uh, illegal,

00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:21,595

in here forever.

that the briefs were never worn.

Great. That means
we have to let the bastard go.

At seven, they took her
blood to remove stem cells.

00:26:49,452 --> 00:26:52,088
Well, Daniel must
have relapsed because

00:26:52,155 --> 00:26:54,357
they took bone marrow twice.

00:27:12,308 --> 00:27:14,978
It takes one to one-and-a-half
liters of marrow

00:27:15,044 --> 00:27:16,346
for a successful harvest.

00:27:16,413 --> 00:27:18,648
A living DNA factory.

00:27:22,051 --> 00:27:24,554

00:27:38,935 --> 00:27:39,803
I don't need help.

00:27:39,869 --> 00:27:40,804
I know.

00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:44,007
I'm just trying to make
the transition seamless.

00:27:45,008 --> 00:27:46,576
Forget I'm here.

00:27:49,946 --> 00:27:54,050
So would you like
to grab a bite later?

00:27:54,117 --> 00:27:55,251
I know a diner
down the street

00:27:55,318 --> 00:27:56,719
that serves a mean
liver and onions.

00:27:56,786 --> 00:27:58,054
I don't eat out.

00:27:58,121 --> 00:27:59,189
Never ever?

00:27:59,255 --> 00:28:01,291
I don't like expectorant.

00:28:01,357 --> 00:28:03,359
Really?

00:28:03,426 --> 00:28:05,328
Kitchen staff talk
while they prepare your food

00:28:05,395 --> 00:28:07,630
and then the wait staff repeats
your order over the plate,

00:28:07,697 --> 00:28:09,099
and by the time
you get your meal,

00:28:09,165 --> 00:28:11,868
there are several DNA samples
coating it.

00:28:11,935 --> 00:28:13,570
Wow.

00:28:13,636 --> 00:28:15,872
No, thank you.

00:28:17,474 --> 00:28:19,576
I don't eat birthday cake
either.

00:28:19,642 --> 00:28:21,044
Oh, blowing out the candles.

00:28:21,111 --> 00:28:22,912
Ugh. Don't get me started.

00:28:22,979 --> 00:28:25,915
( <i>soft whirring</i> )

00:28:33,656 --> 00:28:34,891
Excuse me.

00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:40,530
Um... what happens to April now?

00:28:40,597 --> 00:28:42,532
She is being charged
and processed

00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:45,101
and the court will
probably grant her bill.

00:28:45,168 --> 00:28:46,669
Do you know how much...?

00:28:46,736 --> 00:28:47,604
Why?

00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:49,839
She's my daughter.

00:28:49,906 --> 00:28:51,274
She's refusing to talk
about what happened

00:28:51,341 --> 00:28:52,509
to your youngest
child, Mrs. Perez.

00:28:52,575 --> 00:28:54,577
I can't leave her in jail.

00:28:54,644 --> 00:28:55,945
I think it might be
the best place for her.

00:28:56,012 --> 00:28:56,880
( <i>sighing</i> )

00:28:56,946 --> 00:28:58,481
This is my fault.

00:28:58,548 --> 00:29:01,551
I... I was never there
for her. I...

00:29:01,618 --> 00:29:03,787
Why don't we step
in here, please?

00:29:05,155 --> 00:29:09,159
I spent all my energy getting
Daniel to the next... thing--

00:29:09,225 --> 00:29:12,228
the next pill, the next
treatment, the next remission,

00:29:12,295 --> 00:29:13,563
hoping that this time...

00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:18,134
And, uh... where
did Alicia fit in,

00:29:18,201 --> 00:29:21,271
except for what she
could give to your son?

00:29:21,337 --> 00:29:24,374
You have no idea what it's like.

00:29:24,441 --> 00:29:25,375
I saw her medical records.

00:29:25,442 --> 00:29:26,376
I looked at her X rays.

00:29:26,443 --> 00:29:27,744
I know what that
little girl suffered,

00:29:27,811 --> 00:29:28,912
what you put her through.

00:29:28,978 --> 00:29:31,481
So you would let your child
die and do nothing.

00:29:31,548 --> 00:29:33,483
Never.

00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:36,386
No, you'd talk to doctors
and research.

00:29:36,453 --> 00:29:37,854
And then you'd find out

00:29:37,921 --> 00:29:41,224
that the National Bone Marrow
Registry can't help you

00:29:41,291 --> 00:29:43,726
'cause your son is mixed race.

00:29:43,793 --> 00:29:46,162
And even if he wasn't,
there aren't enough donors.

00:29:46,229 --> 00:29:48,498
Out of four million,
only 205,000

00:29:48,565 --> 00:29:50,433
are Latino.

00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,335
I did what I had to do.

00:29:52,402 --> 00:29:55,438
You put one child over another.

00:29:55,505 --> 00:29:57,273
I don't expect you
to understand.

00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,441
You don't have kids.

00:29:58,508 --> 00:30:00,577
Uh, I have a daughter.

00:30:00,643 --> 00:30:01,578
( <i>wry chuckle</i> )

00:30:01,644 --> 00:30:05,181
So, what kind of
mother are you?

00:30:05,248 --> 00:30:06,616
When do you
see her?

00:30:06,683 --> 00:30:08,017
You work nights.

00:30:08,084 --> 00:30:10,954
You probably don't even know
where she is half the time.

00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:13,656
Alicia's life may not
have been simple,

00:30:13,723 --> 00:30:16,493
but at least I knew her.

00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,027
Can you say the same?

00:30:23,666 --> 00:30:24,667
Where's Greg?

00:30:24,734 --> 00:30:28,838
Helping, uh... Sara.

00:30:28,905 --> 00:30:33,843
I need the tox results
for Alicia Perez.

00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:35,178
Still pending,

00:30:35,245 --> 00:30:37,313
but the blood
on the mother's
T-shirt

00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,648
matches the blood
on the blanket.

00:30:38,715 --> 00:30:39,649
Belongs to the victim.

00:30:39,716 --> 00:30:40,517
Menstrual?

00:30:40,583 --> 00:30:41,317
Negative.

00:30:43,553 --> 00:30:46,156
Well, the volume of blood
that was found on the blanket

00:30:46,222 --> 00:30:49,692
suggests injury
or some kind of trauma.

00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:50,927
Nevertheless...

00:30:52,228 --> 00:30:53,930
I was very thorough.

00:30:56,433 --> 00:30:59,068
Run it again, please.

00:31:02,705 --> 00:31:05,375
Greg, you said
you wanted to help out.

00:31:05,442 --> 00:31:08,278
Well, yeah, with searching
April's apartment,

00:31:08,344 --> 00:31:09,412
maybe finding the bad guy.

00:31:09,479 --> 00:31:11,714
This counts as field work,
you know?

00:31:11,781 --> 00:31:14,651
Oh, I'm smiling on the inside.

00:31:14,717 --> 00:31:17,187
Dirty laundry or garbage.

00:31:17,253 --> 00:31:18,188
You know what?

00:31:18,254 --> 00:31:20,323
You take the garbage.

00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:21,724
Thanks.

00:31:38,575 --> 00:31:39,576
Hmm.

00:31:42,746 --> 00:31:45,014
No. Why?

00:31:45,081 --> 00:31:47,951
Well, she MapQuest

00:31:48,017 --> 00:31:50,086
to the convenience store

00:31:50,153 --> 00:31:51,821

LINDSEY:
I already told you, Mom,

00:32:05,835 --> 00:32:08,271
I heard you.
Can we go now?

00:32:08,338 --> 00:32:11,007
No. You need to see
for yourself

00:32:11,074 --> 00:32:14,010
why you can't
ever hitchhike
or go downtown

00:32:14,077 --> 00:32:16,746
or be careless
with your safety.

00:32:16,813 --> 00:32:18,782
Are you ready?

00:32:18,848 --> 00:32:20,683
Just do it. I'm not scared.

00:32:30,627 --> 00:32:34,431
She was waiting
for a bus downtown
when she was attacked.

00:32:34,497 --> 00:32:36,166
She's was 23.

00:32:36,232 --> 00:32:38,334
She was taller and stronger

00:32:38,401 --> 00:32:39,836
than you, Lindsey.

00:32:39,903 --> 00:32:41,905
She fought back
and didn't win.

Someone's gonna have
to tell her family.

00:32:44,074 --> 00:32:46,643
Her parents are gonna
have to see her like this.

a different way

00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,995
Well, with due respect, Doc,
this doesn't concern you.

Ever notice how childhood keeps
getting shorter and shorter?

Whose fault is that?

00:33:10,433 --> 00:33:12,702
I honestly don't know!

00:33:17,166 --> 00:33:19,068
We subpoenaed Map Quest--
they store each page

00:33:19,135 --> 00:33:20,336
on a different server.

00:33:20,403 --> 00:33:22,038
All queries are
saved for 72 hours,

00:33:22,105 --> 00:33:23,306
then they dump the core.

The suspect doesn't
have a computer,

00:33:24,874 --> 00:33:27,010
but she could've gone
to the library or used
a service.

No, physical location
doesn't matter.

Using the Internet

we can get to the server.

Which will ultimately lead
to the Internet account holder.

Oxycodone for pain,

Diazepam? That's a pretty
hard-core antidepressant

for a kid that small.

I guess they didn't
want her complaining

premeditated murder.

People do what you say
in a crisis.

00:37:12,936 --> 00:37:14,204
So?

00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:15,705
So this time Alicia said no.

00:37:15,772 --> 00:37:17,307
She wanted to
keep her kidney,

00:37:17,373 --> 00:37:20,143
and that pissed you off.

00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:21,878
So you killed her.

00:37:21,945 --> 00:37:23,079
That's ridiculous.

00:37:23,146 --> 00:37:24,747
She was angry--
she wanted to play

00:37:24,814 --> 00:37:27,016
on the soccer team,
she wanted a life.

00:37:27,083 --> 00:37:29,686
Alicia got angry, sometimes.

00:37:29,752 --> 00:37:31,854
Just sick of it.
We all did.

00:37:31,921 --> 00:37:34,524
But she'd have been devastated
if Daniel had died

00:37:34,591 --> 00:37:37,794
and she did nothing
to prevent it.

00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,429
She loved her brother.

00:37:39,495 --> 00:37:41,030
And you're just
the type of woman

00:37:41,097 --> 00:37:42,832
that would never let her
forget it.

00:37:44,634 --> 00:37:47,036
Come on, Alicia wanted out
of this game,

00:37:47,103 --> 00:37:49,305
and you couldn't
let that happen.

00:37:49,372 --> 00:37:51,507
Not to Daniel,
not to your only son,

00:37:51,574 --> 00:37:53,276
your favorite child.

00:37:53,343 --> 00:37:58,615
<i>You slipped Alicia</i>
<i>some of Daniel's Oxycodone.</i>

00:38:01,017 --> 00:38:04,454
Alicia? Time for your pills.

00:38:08,424 --> 00:38:11,361
So now you got a problem--
you had a dead body in the house

00:38:11,427 --> 00:38:12,896
and no plausible explanation.

00:38:12,962 --> 00:38:14,397
What are you gonna do?

00:38:14,464 --> 00:38:16,132
So you call your
daughter April.

00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:17,467
You make up a story,

00:38:17,534 --> 00:38:20,904
you play your roles,
and put on a show.

00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:24,908
SYBIL:
Wait. We have to do this right.

00:38:28,144 --> 00:38:31,681
Oh, you know,
I-I thought the, uh, the slap

00:38:31,748 --> 00:38:33,349
was a nice touch.

00:38:35,151 --> 00:38:36,853
I have a confirmation.

00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,655
Those blue fibers
are consistent

00:38:38,721 --> 00:38:41,324
with the blanket that
the girl was wrapped in.

00:38:41,391 --> 00:38:43,660
And the shoe prints that
I found at the scene

00:38:43,726 --> 00:38:46,062
they're a match to the
father's work boots.

00:38:46,129 --> 00:38:47,497
I retested the T-shirt

00:38:47,564 --> 00:38:48,831
and the blanket.

00:38:48,898 --> 00:38:51,334
The blood still matches
Alicia Perez.

00:38:51,401 --> 00:38:54,137
The evidence
supports this

00:38:54,204 --> 00:38:56,406
unless you'd like
to second-guess that also.

00:38:57,507 --> 00:38:58,741
I just expect things

00:38:58,808 --> 00:39:00,510
to be done correctly, Greg.

00:39:00,577 --> 00:39:02,745
We all have to learn
how to accept change.

00:39:02,812 --> 00:39:04,280
Mia's doing a great job.

00:39:04,347 --> 00:39:07,116
It would be nice if someone
other than me said so.

00:39:07,183 --> 00:39:09,085
You're right.

00:39:10,153 --> 00:39:11,621
What about the
handkerchief?

00:39:11,688 --> 00:39:13,723
I compared that
to the other blood evidence.

00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:15,158
It's also match

00:39:15,225 --> 00:39:17,227
to the victim.

00:39:44,087 --> 00:39:48,491
I didn't realize
until... today...

00:39:50,326 --> 00:39:55,098
...how lucky I am.

00:39:55,164 --> 00:40:00,937
I know pretty much...
how and when I'm gonna die.

00:40:02,438 --> 00:40:04,941
Most people don't.

00:40:05,008 --> 00:40:08,011
It's what they're
afraid of.

00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:12,582
Was your sister afraid?

00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:16,853
Never.

00:40:19,155 --> 00:40:20,924
I'm 11 years older than her,

00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:23,026
and she took care of <i>me.</i>

00:40:26,329 --> 00:40:29,632
She was my best friend,
and I miss her.

00:40:36,072 --> 00:40:38,308
As much pain as...

00:40:38,374 --> 00:40:42,178
I caused her...

00:40:42,245 --> 00:40:44,113
and she wouldn't give up,

00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:49,052
and she... she wouldn't
let me, either.

00:40:49,118 --> 00:40:53,189
That's why...

00:40:53,256 --> 00:40:56,693
during the last relapse,
I made my parents swear

00:40:56,759 --> 00:40:59,596
that it was
the very last time.

00:40:59,662 --> 00:41:02,899
But then your kidneys
failed, and they broke
their word, huh?

00:41:02,966 --> 00:41:07,337
They told me they...
swore not to fight the cancer,

00:41:07,403 --> 00:41:10,473
so this didn't count.

00:41:12,942 --> 00:41:15,245
I wasn't gonna lose this fight.

00:41:15,311 --> 00:41:19,249
( <i>Daniel sobbing</i> )

00:41:22,285 --> 00:41:26,422
SYBIL:
Oh, my God! Please...

00:41:26,489 --> 00:41:27,957
CARLOS:
<i>We have to call the police.</i>

00:41:28,024 --> 00:41:29,659
They'll put him in prison.

00:41:29,726 --> 00:41:32,262
I couldn't watch her
suffer anymore.

00:41:32,328 --> 00:41:35,231
This wasn't a mercy
killing, Daniel.

00:41:35,298 --> 00:41:37,500
This was an execution.

00:41:40,169 --> 00:41:43,206
Bone marrow, transfusions...

00:41:43,273 --> 00:41:45,508
That's her blood
in your veins.

00:41:52,048 --> 00:41:54,183
It dripped out of your
nose onto the blanket

00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:56,452
while you were killing her.

00:41:59,055 --> 00:42:02,125
If you cared so
much for Alicia,

00:42:02,191 --> 00:42:04,861
why didn't you take your
own life instead of hers?

00:42:04,928 --> 00:42:08,231
Suicide isn't
an option.

00:42:08,298 --> 00:42:11,301
It's an unforgivable
sin in the eyes of God.

00:42:11,367 --> 00:42:15,672
But you believe your
God forgives murder?

00:42:15,738 --> 00:42:19,409
If that's your defense, it
won't keep you out of jail.

00:42:21,544 --> 00:42:24,147
But my death will.

00:42:25,782 --> 00:42:26,983
See, I've got

00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:30,853
about six more months.

00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:33,756
I'll be dead before
there's even a trial.

00:42:38,127 --> 00:42:39,729
( <i>sniffles</i> )

00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:43,499
I-I do want to
thank you, though.

00:42:43,566 --> 00:42:44,901
For what?

00:42:44,968 --> 00:42:47,971
For speaking for Alicia.

00:42:48,037 --> 00:42:49,873
You're probably
the first person

00:42:49,939 --> 00:42:52,976
in her life
to think only of her.

00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:58,648
You know,
you may not believe in God, sir,

00:42:58,715 --> 00:43:00,917
but you do His work.
