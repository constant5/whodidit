of trauma in the vaginal cavity.

00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:04,789
Enough to rule out rape?

00:11:04,855 --> 00:11:05,890
Yeah.

00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:07,558
The semen was found at a depth

00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,594
not indicative
of penile penetration.

00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,263
In this case,
only a couple inches in.

00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:15,333
Maybe that's all the killer
had to work with.

00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:18,002
WOMAN:
And now, the moment that we've
all been waiting for.

00:11:18,069 --> 00:11:20,404
The winner of the brand-new
Humvee is...

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,874
Kyle Shaw!

00:11:23,941 --> 00:11:25,476
( <i>screams</i> )
Oh! Oh, my God!

00:11:25,543 --> 00:11:26,611
Honey, we won.

00:11:26,677 --> 00:11:27,845
Whoa!

00:11:27,912 --> 00:11:30,314
Hey, I got over 70 women
working this convention, man.

00:11:30,381 --> 00:11:31,716
Booth bimbos,

00:11:31,782 --> 00:11:33,451
crowd gatherers,

00:11:33,517 --> 00:11:35,553
hostesses, narrators,
demonstrators, translators.

00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,189
Whatever you need, I got it.

00:11:38,256 --> 00:11:40,258
Well, we're only interested
in Lisa Schumacher.

00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:42,026
She's one of my girls.
I represent her.

00:11:42,093 --> 00:11:43,394
They call her "Cris,"

00:11:43,461 --> 00:11:45,229
as in Cristal,
the champagne.

00:11:45,296 --> 00:11:46,397
She can't get enough of it.

00:11:46,464 --> 00:11:47,565
She likes to party?

00:11:47,632 --> 00:11:49,066
She likes to make money.

00:11:49,133 --> 00:11:50,534
Girls who party
make the money.

00:11:50,601 --> 00:11:51,636
This ain't L.A.,

00:11:51,702 --> 00:11:53,537
where you get up at
10:00 a.m. for an audition.

00:11:53,604 --> 00:11:56,207
At 10:00 a.m., my girls
are still at Drai's

00:11:56,274 --> 00:11:57,842
partying with the client.

00:11:57,909 --> 00:11:59,377
What's this about?

00:11:59,443 --> 00:12:01,879
She was found dead
this morning.

00:12:01,946 --> 00:12:03,281
No.

00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:05,216
Come on, she's over there
working the Daluca account.

00:12:05,283 --> 00:12:06,651
You didn't hear?

00:12:06,717 --> 00:12:08,653
There's two million square
feet of exhibits here, man.

00:12:08,719 --> 00:12:10,321
40,000 people.

00:12:10,388 --> 00:12:11,622
This place is a mini-city.

00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,758
That RV exhibit's across town.

00:12:13,824 --> 00:12:16,093
I was told that
the doors close at 10:00.

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,296
Any idea why she
was here after hours?

00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:20,264
Look, she worked
behind a booth,

00:12:20,331 --> 00:12:21,432
yapping her mouth.

00:12:21,499 --> 00:12:23,067
Can't really throw her
in a bikini no more.

00:12:23,134 --> 00:12:24,735
She's getting up there.

00:12:24,802 --> 00:12:26,571
Three-oh, uh-oh.
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:12:26,637 --> 00:12:28,205
I didn't really keep tabs.

00:12:28,272 --> 00:12:29,340
Donny.
You're late.

00:12:29,407 --> 00:12:30,575
And you're not dressed.

00:12:30,641 --> 00:12:31,809
What's the deal, girl?!

00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,644
Please, Donny, I just
had the worst morning.

00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:34,745
Oh, you think you had it bad?

00:12:34,812 --> 00:12:36,314
Well, Cris is dead.

00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,949
Oh, my God.

00:12:40,318 --> 00:12:42,820
It's a tough business.

00:12:46,924 --> 00:12:48,159
Hodges...
( <i>clank</i> )

00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:49,927
What do you want?

00:12:49,994 --> 00:12:51,262
What are you doing?

00:12:51,329 --> 00:12:53,130
I'm looking for leaks.

00:12:53,197 --> 00:12:54,332
Call Facilities.

00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:55,766
You got my results?

00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:57,835
If you knew the kind of stuff
that grows in these pipes,

00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,370
you'd be on your hands
and knees with me.

00:12:59,437 --> 00:13:01,806
The results, Hodges,
from the swabs I gave you?

00:13:01,872 --> 00:13:03,674
From Lisa Schumacher's
fingertips?

00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:07,111
Fine.

00:13:07,178 --> 00:13:08,846
I found several substances.

00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:10,881
Nonoxynol-9 spermicide.

00:13:10,948 --> 00:13:12,083
Spermicide.

00:13:12,149 --> 00:13:14,385
So she did handle a condom.

00:13:14,452 --> 00:13:16,287
Also found traces
of PVP, sorbitol,

00:13:16,354 --> 00:13:18,956
carbomer,
hydroxypropylcellulose--

00:13:19,023 --> 00:13:20,458
Probably a hair gel.

00:13:20,524 --> 00:13:22,560
Well, she did have skin
under her fingernails,

00:13:22,627 --> 00:13:24,729
so she could've scratched
her attacker's scalp.

00:13:24,795 --> 00:13:25,830
Not my job.

00:13:25,897 --> 00:13:28,366
And last,
the brownish-orange substance

00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:30,534
on the vic's fingers,
chest and shoulders:

00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:31,869
instant tanning lotion.

00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,204
Hmm.

00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:35,873
Got four work card hits
from the motor coach.

00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,974
Dana Simmons,

00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:38,809
Candice Mosti,

00:13:38,876 --> 00:13:42,146
Lane Kelly,
and your vic, Lisa Schumacher.

00:13:42,213 --> 00:13:44,649
29 and already over the hill.

00:13:44,715 --> 00:13:46,150
Please tell me you're kidding.

00:13:46,217 --> 00:13:47,318
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:13:47,385 --> 00:13:49,253
This town has
different standards.

00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:52,857
BROWN:
Let me see something.

00:13:52,924 --> 00:13:54,959
( <i>presses keys</i> )

00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,766
Looks like Lisa had a roommate.

00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,602
So my prints are on the RV.

00:14:04,669 --> 00:14:06,804
Okay, I work
that display sometimes.

00:14:06,871 --> 00:14:10,241
It's not just the print
that makes you look bad,
it's you.

00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:11,809
You're raffling off a Hummer

00:14:11,876 --> 00:14:14,045
hours after your roommate
turns up dead.

00:14:14,111 --> 00:14:15,413
What am I supposed to do?

00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:18,082
I'm broke and
my car insurance is due.

00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:20,518
What is that on your arm?
Is that tanner?

00:14:22,386 --> 00:14:24,689
Forgot to rub it in, I guess.

00:14:24,755 --> 00:14:26,757
Razor-tight girl like you

00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:28,559
forgetting to rub
tanning lotion in?

00:14:28,626 --> 00:14:30,361
Doesn't sound right to me.

00:14:30,428 --> 00:14:32,396
You know, the funny thing is,
is your girlfriend Lisa

00:14:32,463 --> 00:14:34,899
had streaks of tanner
on her body, too.

00:14:34,966 --> 00:14:37,268
Were you girls
together last night?

00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:39,804
Donny asked us to hang out

00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,105
with Mr. Daluca after work.

00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:42,440
You and Lisa?

00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:43,841
Me, Lisa, Dana, and Lane.

00:14:45,309 --> 00:14:47,144
You guys just "went out"?

00:14:47,211 --> 00:14:48,579
Come on.

00:14:48,646 --> 00:14:49,914
Look, I'm not a hooker.

00:14:49,981 --> 00:14:51,749
All I do is
these conventions.

00:14:51,816 --> 00:14:53,884
So when a big baller
like Mr. Daluca comes into town

00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:55,453
and offers us a little cash
to hang out,

00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,554
I'm with it.

00:14:56,621 --> 00:14:59,690
"With it" where?

00:14:59,757 --> 00:15:02,360
We had dinner at Fix.
Partied at Mix.

00:15:02,426 --> 00:15:03,895
Gambled a little.

00:15:03,961 --> 00:15:06,464
Then he took us back
to the convention center.

00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,499
Hammered and horny.

00:15:08,566 --> 00:15:10,167
Oh!

00:15:10,234 --> 00:15:11,736
Okay.

00:15:11,802 --> 00:15:13,671
Who gets the first ride?

00:15:13,738 --> 00:15:14,906
( <i>Daluca laughing</i> )

00:15:16,908 --> 00:15:19,410
If I wanted
someone your age,

00:15:19,477 --> 00:15:20,945
I'd do my wife.

00:15:21,012 --> 00:15:23,180
( <i>laughs</i> )

00:15:23,247 --> 00:15:24,615
Price of one, huh?
Yeah.

00:15:24,682 --> 00:15:26,984
( <i>sobbing</i> )

00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,586
I left there as soon as I could.

00:15:28,653 --> 00:15:29,921
I took a cab home.

00:15:29,987 --> 00:15:31,088
Did Daluca get
rough with her?

00:15:31,155 --> 00:15:32,223
Not that I saw.

00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:33,791
He didn't even
want to touch her.

00:15:33,858 --> 00:15:36,794
Really? Because we found
Lisa's DNA on a condom.

00:15:36,861 --> 00:15:38,763
When I left, Daluca was busy
with Dana and Lane,

00:15:38,829 --> 00:15:40,698
and Lisa locked herself
in the bathroom.

00:15:40,765 --> 00:15:43,367
That was the last time
I saw her.

00:15:43,434 --> 00:15:45,570
MAN:
You want my prints?

00:15:45,636 --> 00:15:47,004
My DNA?

00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:49,240
I mean, come on, guys.
I'm on vacation here.

00:15:49,307 --> 00:15:50,675
Having a sample of your DNA

00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,877
would help exclude you
as a suspect.

00:15:52,944 --> 00:15:54,211
Voluntary or court order,

00:15:54,278 --> 00:15:55,746
it's your choice.

00:15:55,813 --> 00:15:57,848
My DNA is gonna be
all over that girl,

00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:59,951
but I didn't put it there,
she did.

00:16:00,017 --> 00:16:02,219
Now, this broad was expiring

00:16:02,286 --> 00:16:03,321
like spoiled milk,

00:16:03,387 --> 00:16:04,889
and she was looking
for a way out.

00:16:04,956 --> 00:16:07,892
( <i>sobbing</i> )

00:16:09,227 --> 00:16:11,162
( <i>music playing in distance</i> )

00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:15,600
You still here?

00:16:17,368 --> 00:16:18,402
You bitch.

00:16:18,469 --> 00:16:20,137
( <i>crying</i> )
!
You bitch!

00:16:20,204 --> 00:16:21,806
She puts my baby inside her,

00:16:21,872 --> 00:16:23,574
hey, quickie retirement plan.

00:16:23,641 --> 00:16:25,243
You know, I can't think
of a better reason

00:16:25,309 --> 00:16:26,344
for a man to kill a woman.

00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:27,445
If I'd have killed her,

00:16:27,511 --> 00:16:29,247
you think I'd put her
in my own motorcoach,

00:16:29,313 --> 00:16:31,415
and then present it
at an unveiling ceremony

00:16:31,482 --> 00:16:33,284
that I was announcing?

00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:38,756
You don't believe me, go ask
the convention authorities.

00:16:38,823 --> 00:16:40,725
I told them what
she was trying to do.

00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:44,095
It's the last time I ever hire
those skanks to work a show.

00:16:44,161 --> 00:16:45,596
Ye... Yes, yes, I'm very aware

00:16:45,663 --> 00:16:47,765
of Butterfield Academy's
privacy policy,

00:16:47,832 --> 00:16:49,033
but this a homicide...

00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,535
Daluca's all over the condoms.

00:16:51,602 --> 00:16:53,638
Get this, on one of them,

00:16:53,704 --> 00:16:56,240
his DNA and her epithelials
are on both sides.

00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:59,243
Well, that's kind of like
turning a sock inside out.

00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,845
It does support
his story, though.

00:17:00,912 --> 00:17:03,180
Well, what about
the epithelials
under her nails?

00:17:03,247 --> 00:17:04,916
It's not a match
to Daluca.

00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,517
So where does
that leave us?

00:17:06,584 --> 00:17:08,185
Oh, I'm not quite done yet.

00:17:10,755 --> 00:17:12,490
Have a seat, Donny.

00:17:14,792 --> 00:17:17,228
What kind of hair
gel do you use?

00:17:17,295 --> 00:17:18,296
Well, I don't
think it would

00:17:18,362 --> 00:17:19,597
work with the texture
of your hair.

00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:20,765
Real funny.

00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:22,300
What are you doing?

00:17:22,366 --> 00:17:24,335
Please stay still.

00:17:27,104 --> 00:17:28,873
How did you get these scratches
in your head?

00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,608
Probably from scratching.

00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:32,043
I'm always thinking.

00:17:32,109 --> 00:17:34,312
I'll tell you
what you were thinking.

00:17:34,378 --> 00:17:37,148
You were thinking about how Lisa
pissed off your best client.

00:17:37,214 --> 00:17:39,483
And how much business
it was gonna cost you.

00:17:41,218 --> 00:17:43,588
<i>You kill her,</i>

00:17:43,654 --> 00:17:45,957
<i>Daluca takes the fall.</i>

00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,826
<i>Win-win for you.</i>

00:17:48,893 --> 00:17:50,895
Lisa was a nothing.

00:17:50,962 --> 00:17:52,430
Old news.

00:17:52,496 --> 00:17:54,765
Why would I risk everything
for a zero like her?

00:17:54,832 --> 00:17:56,234
For that exact reason,

00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,301
'cause she was
a "nothing" to you.

00:17:57,368 --> 00:17:59,003
That's a good story.

00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,238
You find that in one

00:19:49,518 --> 00:19:50,653

00:19:51,787 --> 00:19:53,823
Paul cut down on clients

00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:56,926
so he could train
for Mr. Las Vegas.

00:19:56,993 --> 00:19:58,728
It's next month, and...

00:19:58,794 --> 00:20:01,330
he really wanted to win
this time.

00:20:01,397 --> 00:20:03,332
He canceled
my last two workouts.

00:20:03,399 --> 00:20:05,768

00:20:31,694 --> 00:20:33,196
He said he had a headache.

00:20:33,262 --> 00:20:34,597
But I mean,

00:20:34,664 --> 00:20:35,932
he was training
really, really hard,

00:20:35,998 --> 00:20:37,400
so he was probably just tired.

00:20:37,466 --> 00:20:38,701

Blunt-force trauma.

Absence of bruising.

00:21:42,031 --> 00:21:43,866

in "smackdown."

There was no blood

Sara, I just
want you to know,

00:24:34,971 --> 00:24:37,506
when we were in the shower,
I didn't see anything.

00:24:37,573 --> 00:24:39,809
Really? Gosh,
I saw everything.

00:24:41,577 --> 00:24:42,745
ROBBINS:
The black pus

00:24:42,812 --> 00:24:44,447
suggested a
possible infection

00:24:44,513 --> 00:24:45,748
from an
airborne agent.

00:24:45,815 --> 00:24:47,450
I took the precaution
to get you out

00:24:47,516 --> 00:24:49,018
until Hazmat
cleared the scene.

00:24:49,085 --> 00:24:50,219

Uh, what did they find?

00:24:53,022 --> 00:24:54,624
Actually, it's what <i>I</i> found--

00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:57,293
mucormycosis, a
disease caused

00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,229
by exposure to rhizopus oryzae,
a kind of mold.

00:25:00,296 --> 00:25:01,397
Did you say rhizopus oryzae?

00:25:01,464 --> 00:25:02,732
Mm-hmm.

00:25:02,798 --> 00:25:03,933
We spent hours in that house.

00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,001
You're not at risk.

00:25:05,067 --> 00:25:07,370
You both have
healthy immune systems.

00:25:07,436 --> 00:25:10,239
I suspect that's not
the case with your vic.

00:25:10,306 --> 00:25:11,374
Copy that.
Trace on the syringes

00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,376
was Deca-Durabolin,
Sustanon and Oxandrolone.

00:25:13,442 --> 00:25:14,844
Steroids.

00:25:14,911 --> 00:25:17,513
That guy was "stacking"
to get bigger.

00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,715
HODGES:
Immune suppression is
a common side effect.

00:25:19,782 --> 00:25:21,617
So, how does a mold infection
make it look

00:25:21,684 --> 00:25:23,519
like someone smashed him
across the face?

00:25:23,586 --> 00:25:25,521
His face collapsed
from the inside.

00:25:25,588 --> 00:25:27,323
Mucor causes
deterioration

00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:29,859
of the bones around the sinuses
and eye sockets.

00:25:29,926 --> 00:25:31,861
You remember the
swollen eyeball?

00:25:31,928 --> 00:25:34,497
The pus was pushing it out,
while the bones

00:25:34,564 --> 00:25:35,698
that held
it in place

00:25:35,765 --> 00:25:37,533
were getting eaten away.

00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,137
<i>The airborne mold spores</i>
<i>enter the nasal cavity</i>

00:25:41,204 --> 00:25:45,308
<i>and they consume sinus tissue</i>
<i>as they multiply.</i>

00:25:47,009 --> 00:25:48,277
So, his compromised
immune system

00:25:48,344 --> 00:25:50,746
wasn't strong enough to fight
the spread of the infection.

00:25:50,813 --> 00:25:52,715
That's right.
Sick.

00:25:52,782 --> 00:25:54,517
And what's even more sick

00:25:54,584 --> 00:25:57,620
is that rhizopus oryzae
likes to grow on human tissue.

00:25:57,687 --> 00:26:00,523
<i>Mold grows outward</i>
<i>as spores reproduce</i>

00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:02,992
<i>and are carried away</i>
<i>from the source.</i>

00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:05,895
<i>If we can pinpoint the source</i>
<i>of the human tissue,</i>

00:26:05,962 --> 00:26:08,297
<i>that should tell you something.</i>

00:26:32,221 --> 00:26:35,358
Whew! We have <i>got</i> to be getting

00:26:35,424 --> 00:26:36,592
close to the source.

Hit the lights.

00:26:53,809 --> 00:26:56,012
A whole lot of blood.

We're getting warmer.

00:27:24,974 --> 00:27:26,409

00:27:26,475 --> 00:27:27,944

00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:29,145
SANDERS:
Okay.

00:27:29,212 --> 00:27:31,814
So, how does human tissue
get inside a wall?

00:27:31,881 --> 00:27:32,915
Good question.

00:27:35,685 --> 00:27:38,054
SIDLE:
There's a hole in the air duct.

00:27:41,757 --> 00:27:44,193
A <i>bullet</i> hole...

00:27:46,262 --> 00:27:47,930
Looks like a nine mil.

00:27:47,997 --> 00:27:50,700
Same as the handgun
I found in the bedroom.

00:27:50,766 --> 00:27:52,401
Copper-jacketed.

00:27:52,468 --> 00:27:54,403
Good penetrating power.

00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:56,405
Somebody was shot here.

00:27:56,472 --> 00:27:57,640
( <i>woman screaming</i> )

00:27:57,707 --> 00:27:59,108

00:27:59,175 --> 00:28:02,178
Bullet pushed blood and tissue
through the wall.

00:28:02,245 --> 00:28:05,014
Water from the pipe leak
fed the mold growth.

00:28:05,081 --> 00:28:08,351
SANDERS:
<i>Eventually,</i>
<i>the mold released spores,</i>

00:28:08,417 --> 00:28:10,820
<i>which spread</i>
<i>through the house AC,</i>

00:28:10,887 --> 00:28:13,656
<i>and right on up</i>
<i>into muscle-head's nose.</i>

00:28:13,723 --> 00:28:16,125
We ran the phone numbers
from the vic's planner.

00:28:16,192 --> 00:28:17,860
Everybody checked out,
except for

00:28:17,927 --> 00:28:19,128
a woman named Tiffany.

00:28:19,195 --> 00:28:20,296
No last name?

00:28:20,363 --> 00:28:21,731
Well, Tiffany is actually
a street name

00:28:21,797 --> 00:28:22,798
for Angela Wheeler,

00:28:22,865 --> 00:28:24,033
known prostitute.

00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,302
Her family reported her missing
last month.

00:28:26,369 --> 00:28:30,106
Well, anyone who appears
this narcissistic

00:28:30,172 --> 00:28:31,440
may prefer paying for hookers

00:28:31,507 --> 00:28:33,476
rather than wasting his love
on a girlfriend.

00:28:33,543 --> 00:28:35,978
And as we know, in addition
to immune suppression

00:28:36,045 --> 00:28:37,480
and heart and liver disease,

00:28:37,547 --> 00:28:40,149
steroid abuse can also cause
shrunken testicles,

00:28:40,216 --> 00:28:42,385
impotence and aggression--
"roid rage."

00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:44,987
Oh, baby,

00:28:45,054 --> 00:28:47,723
looks like you
have one muscle
that isn't hard.

00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:49,659
You think that's funny, bitch?!

00:28:52,461 --> 00:28:55,531
So, if the DNA
from the tissue on the bullet

00:28:55,598 --> 00:28:56,999
matches Tiffany...

00:28:57,066 --> 00:28:58,267
We have a sample?

00:28:58,334 --> 00:29:00,836
A DNA reference sample
was collected from her apartment

00:29:00,903 --> 00:29:02,138
in the initial
investigation.

00:29:02,205 --> 00:29:03,339
Mia's on it.

00:29:05,041 --> 00:29:06,275
Very good.

00:29:06,342 --> 00:29:07,743
This is just like

00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:09,645
that Edgar Allen Poe story
where the victim's

00:29:09,712 --> 00:29:11,314
heart
under the floorboards

00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:12,548
betrays the murder.

00:29:12,615 --> 00:29:13,649
"The Tell-Tale Heart."

00:29:13,716 --> 00:29:15,985
I thought you didn't like
reading the classics.

00:29:16,052 --> 00:29:17,920
I do when they're about
dismembered bodies.

00:29:23,326 --> 00:29:25,061

Move over Chester,

00:29:44,113 --> 00:29:46,849
Come on, now,
move over a little bit.

00:29:46,916 --> 00:29:48,117
Let me sit down.

00:29:48,184 --> 00:29:50,386

00:29:50,453 --> 00:29:51,287
It's not me.

Why don't you
put your shoes

00:29:52,588 --> 00:29:53,689
back on?

00:30:01,631 --> 00:30:02,732
Oh, sweet Lord.

00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,869
Kid can't be more
than 12 or 13.

00:30:06,936 --> 00:30:08,004
You think he's homeless?

00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:10,339
Jeans are a little nice
for a homeless kid.

00:30:10,406 --> 00:30:12,041
Check his veins and
do a SART kit anyway.

00:30:12,108 --> 00:30:14,844
Can you ballpark
a T.O.D.?

00:30:14,911 --> 00:30:16,546
Sure.

00:30:19,482 --> 00:30:22,885
Well, he's just
developing rigor,

00:30:22,952 --> 00:30:26,055
so, I'd say dead
no more than eight hours.

00:30:26,122 --> 00:30:29,892
This is a busy line--
buses, traffic...

00:30:29,959 --> 00:30:30,927
And nobody noticed him?

00:30:30,993 --> 00:30:32,595
Maybe be hasn't been here
the whole time.

00:30:32,662 --> 00:30:33,696
Could explain the blanket.

00:30:33,763 --> 00:30:35,498
Body dump.

00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:49,845
Hey, Chester,

00:30:49,912 --> 00:30:51,781
you been taking that thing
off road again?

00:30:51,847 --> 00:30:53,916
Nah, mud screws up the ride.

00:30:53,983 --> 00:30:56,285
I bet you always get a bad cart

00:30:56,352 --> 00:30:58,287
at the store, huh?

00:30:58,354 --> 00:31:00,523
Not me.

00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:02,024

Sir, all I'm asking for
is your class roster.

Ye... Yes, yes, I'm very aware

00:32:41,291 --> 00:32:43,527
of Butterfield Academy's
privacy policy,

00:32:43,593 --> 00:32:45,495
but this a homicide
investigation.

00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:49,041
Sir, please,
court orders take time.

00:32:49,041 --> 00:32:51,410
You could help me
identify this boy tonight.

00:32:53,542 --> 00:32:55,411
Okay.

00:32:55,478 --> 00:32:56,500
No, no, no.

ROBBINS:
Whatever happened
to this boy wasn't pretty.

00:33:05,283 --> 00:33:07,218
First- and second-degree burns

00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:09,387
on several areas
of exposed skin.

00:33:09,454 --> 00:33:10,789
What about the
burn to the face?

00:33:10,855 --> 00:33:12,023
Could that be
from an iron?

00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:14,025
ROBBINS:
It's a possibility.

00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:17,162
He sustained several hematomas
along his arms,

00:33:17,228 --> 00:33:19,664
together with a nasty
skull fracture.

00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:21,433
I'm thinking child abuse.

00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,101
Skull fracture what killed him?

00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:24,336
No. Positional asphyxia.

00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:25,503
Check out his eyes.

00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:27,439
Heat damage.

00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:29,441
To all the respiratory mucosa,
as well.

00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:32,243
I'd say this kid
was in a small, hot space

00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,611
for quite a while.

00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,580

00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:42,520
Yeah.

00:33:42,587 --> 00:33:44,756
I heard you were looking
for the student directory

00:33:44,823 --> 00:33:47,492
for Butterfield Academy.

00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:49,227
Yeah. Yeah.
How'd you get this?

00:33:49,294 --> 00:33:50,762
I talked to the headmaster.

00:33:50,829 --> 00:33:52,197
He wouldn't give me jack.

00:33:52,263 --> 00:33:53,865
I pay tuition.

00:33:53,932 --> 00:33:55,533
Your daughter goes
to Butterfield?

00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,102
Mm-hmm.

00:33:57,168 --> 00:33:58,403
Wow. That's a little pricy.

00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:00,605
She was at a crossroads
and I, uh, needed to put her

00:34:00,672 --> 00:34:02,774
in a school with
tighter reins.
You know,

00:34:02,841 --> 00:34:04,743
when it comes to your kids,
you, uh, find the money.

00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:06,044
Yeah.

00:34:06,111 --> 00:34:07,479

00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:35,974
I've been

ringing the bell.

00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:38,310
Sorry. I was sleeping.

00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:39,511
No school today?

00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:41,513
I'm sick.
The whole house is sick.

00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:42,681
Oh, gosh. Okay.

00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:44,949
Uh, well, my name's Nick Stokes.

00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:47,452
I'm with the Las Vegas
Police Department,

00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:49,554
and, uh,
this is pretty important.

00:34:49,621 --> 00:34:50,922
Parents around?

00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:53,291
No. Uh, they're not home.

00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:54,893
Do you have

00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,196
their cell phone or
work numbers handy?

00:35:02,067 --> 00:35:03,435
Okay, they're skiing in Vail.

00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:06,037
What are you gonna do,
arrest me for having a kegger?

00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,272
No, not exactly.

00:35:07,339 --> 00:35:09,374
Um...

00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:10,842
how old are you?

00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:13,078
What's going on, babe?

00:35:13,144 --> 00:35:14,379
Just go...

00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:15,613
What?

00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,315
How old is he?

00:35:17,382 --> 00:35:19,050
My father's a lawyer,

00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:22,454
so I probably
shouldn't be talking to you.

00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,222
You have a brother?

00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:25,123
Chase?

00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,124
Yeah, Chase.

00:35:26,191 --> 00:35:27,359
Is, uh... is he around?

00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:30,395
No, he spent the night
at his friend Andy's house.

00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:31,896
Is that the last time
you saw him?

00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,031
I don't know.

00:35:33,098 --> 00:35:34,132
Do you have a picture

00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:36,067
of your brother
I can take a look at?

00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,802
Yeah.

00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:39,671
Would you get that
for me, please?

00:35:39,738 --> 00:35:41,506
Thank you.

00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,853
Um...

00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:56,855
I'm gonna need your parents'

contact information
if you don't mind,

00:35:59,391 --> 00:36:01,426
in Vail, okay?

00:36:03,795 --> 00:36:05,830
Your Chase's
best friend, Andy.

00:36:05,897 --> 00:36:08,566
I need to know what happened
last night.

00:36:08,633 --> 00:36:11,036
Andy was supposed
to sleep over at Chase's,

00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:12,804
but Chase wasn't feeling well,

00:36:12,871 --> 00:36:14,372
so Andy came home
early instead.

00:36:14,439 --> 00:36:15,540
Ma'am, please,

00:36:15,607 --> 00:36:17,342
I need to hear
Andy's version.

00:36:17,409 --> 00:36:18,777
Okay?

00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:21,379
Go ahead, Andy.

00:36:21,446 --> 00:36:24,816
I told my mom
I was sleeping

00:36:24,883 --> 00:36:27,385
at Chase's house,
and he told

00:36:27,452 --> 00:36:29,688
his sister
we were sleeping at my house.

00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:31,356
Where were the Ryans?

00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:33,892
They were in Vail.

00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:38,029
We just wanted
to see a high school party.

00:36:38,096 --> 00:36:39,230
And did you?

00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:41,166
Some of it.

00:36:41,232 --> 00:36:43,902
( <i>loud music and chatter</i> )

00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:50,208

Just keep drinking.
It must get better.

00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:53,812
Jackie caught us.

00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,180
Made us leave.

00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:57,716
We promised to
go to my house.

00:36:57,782 --> 00:36:59,284
We didn't.

00:36:59,351 --> 00:37:00,986
We went to this arcade,

00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,554
played a few games,

00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:03,822
and then I walked home.

00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,657
What about Chase?

00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:06,891
He stayed there,

00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:09,794
playing the games.

00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:13,765
Talk to me, Goose.

00:37:13,832 --> 00:37:15,867
Well, according to tox,
junior was a boozer.

00:37:15,934 --> 00:37:18,169
BAC three times
the legal limit.

00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:21,006
Yeah, the, uh, teenage
sister had a kegger.

00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,874
How old were you
when you first got drunk?

00:37:22,941 --> 00:37:25,276
Oh, 16, 17.

00:37:25,343 --> 00:37:28,947
Amortized over a generation,
12's about right?

00:37:29,014 --> 00:37:31,216
So your saying,
two generations from now,

00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:33,952
four-year-olds are just
gonna be getting trashed?

00:37:34,019 --> 00:37:36,321
Pre-school graduation parties
are going to be off the hook.

00:37:36,388 --> 00:37:37,389
Mm.

00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:39,090
But Chase's party was just
getting started.

00:37:39,157 --> 00:37:41,693
Tape lifts
were a cornucopia.

Hairs: Caucasoid,
Mongoloid, Negroid.

00:37:44,796 --> 00:37:46,765
And feline and canine.

00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:49,601
As for fibers,
we have cotton, wool, polyester,

00:37:49,668 --> 00:37:51,403
and someone brought Lycra.

Transfer from the blanket?

00:37:52,971 --> 00:37:54,272
No. I tested that.

00:37:54,339 --> 00:37:55,774
It came back clean.

00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,109
Okay. What about the, uh,
the gack in the guy's hair?

00:37:58,176 --> 00:38:01,079
Melted vulcanized rubber
and thermoplastic elastomers.

00:40:52,525 --> 00:40:53,826
See what it did to my vest.

00:40:53,893 --> 00:40:55,194
I have to go
to work in this.

00:40:55,261 --> 00:40:56,495
I demand justice!

00:40:56,562 --> 00:40:58,064
Hey, will you get the hell
out of here?

00:40:58,130 --> 00:40:59,365
So I went next door.

00:40:59,432 --> 00:41:02,201
Had to get the smell
of detergent out of my nose.

00:41:02,268 --> 00:41:04,003
Bought a Yoo-hoo.

00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:06,972
I came back to check on things.

00:41:15,314 --> 00:41:18,284
I didn't know
if he was dead or not.

00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,923
Bus bench. Hospital.

00:41:23,989 --> 00:41:26,392
I could see how you
could make the mistake.

00:41:26,459 --> 00:41:29,028
You have any idea
what the liability would be

00:41:29,095 --> 00:41:30,262
on something like that?

00:41:30,329 --> 00:41:31,430
Uh-uh.

00:41:31,497 --> 00:41:32,998
But I'll let you know.

00:41:33,065 --> 00:41:35,935
I was just hoping
that somebody would find him

00:41:36,001 --> 00:41:38,037
and take care of him.

00:41:38,104 --> 00:41:40,039
Hey...

00:41:40,106 --> 00:41:42,475
<i>you</i> found him.

00:41:43,583 --> 00:41:45,819
<i>You</i> put him in the dryer.

00:41:45,885 --> 00:41:48,021
Mm-mm.

00:41:48,087 --> 00:41:49,689
Mm-hmm.

00:41:49,756 --> 00:41:51,491
Mm-hmm. Chase can't even
lock himself

00:41:51,558 --> 00:41:52,659
inside those things.

00:41:52,725 --> 00:41:54,527
They lock from
the outside.

00:41:54,594 --> 00:41:55,895
And I matched
your print

00:41:55,962 --> 00:41:57,463
on the handle.

00:41:57,530 --> 00:41:59,833
I got it off your school's
safe kit.

00:42:02,468 --> 00:42:05,505
He asked me to.

00:42:05,572 --> 00:42:08,575
( <i>laughing</i> ):
Whoa! Dude!

00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,415
Come on, turn it on!

00:42:15,482 --> 00:42:17,350
Turn it on!

00:42:27,126 --> 00:42:31,130
And after that,
it gets a little fuzzy.

00:42:32,832 --> 00:42:35,268
You put your best friend
in a... in a dryer,

00:42:35,335 --> 00:42:37,704
and you turned it on,

00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:40,673
and you just
walked away?

00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:43,443
What is wrong with you?

00:43:09,302 --> 00:43:11,371
Tough shift, huh?

00:43:11,437 --> 00:43:13,439
Just another day
in paradise.

00:43:17,166 --> 00:43:19,235
( <i>phone rings</i> )

00:43:19,302 --> 00:43:21,104
Crime lab.
How can we help you?
