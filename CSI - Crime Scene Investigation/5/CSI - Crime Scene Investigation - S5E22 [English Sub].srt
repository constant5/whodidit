00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:21,543
Hi.

00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:22,744
Hey.

00:00:22,811 --> 00:00:25,146
Husband and wife got into it.

00:00:25,213 --> 00:00:26,314
Hmm.

00:00:26,381 --> 00:00:27,349
Hmm.

00:00:27,415 --> 00:00:28,283
What set them off?

00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:29,284
She caught him

00:00:29,351 --> 00:00:30,285
with a hooker in their bed.

00:00:30,352 --> 00:00:31,820
She cut him.

00:00:31,887 --> 00:00:33,622
He killed her.

00:00:33,688 --> 00:00:34,890
What about the hooker?

00:00:34,956 --> 00:00:36,324
She grabbed his wallet
and took off.

00:00:36,391 --> 00:00:38,193
I caught the guy
just sitting on a curb.

00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:39,928
I swabbed his hands
for blood spatter.

00:00:39,995 --> 00:00:42,030
I am super backed up.

00:00:42,097 --> 00:00:43,598
Can this wait till tomorrow?

00:00:43,665 --> 00:00:45,634
He's not going anywhere.

00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,737
Thanks, Mia.

00:00:48,803 --> 00:00:49,905
Yeah...

00:00:49,971 --> 00:00:51,506
Oh, hey, guys.

00:00:51,573 --> 00:00:52,741
I could really use a drink.

00:00:52,807 --> 00:00:54,175
You want to join me?
I'm buying.

00:00:54,242 --> 00:00:56,044
I'd love a drink,
but we made plans, though?

00:00:56,111 --> 00:00:57,245
You did?

00:00:57,312 --> 00:00:58,446
Tomorrow.
Rain check.

00:00:58,513 --> 00:00:59,614
All right.

00:00:59,681 --> 00:01:01,283
Rain check.

00:01:01,349 --> 00:01:03,985
Okay.

00:01:10,058 --> 00:01:12,060
( <i>crowd chatter</i> )

00:01:15,263 --> 00:01:17,332
No way you were never married.

00:01:17,399 --> 00:01:18,633
Oh, let me guess.

00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,168
You were young,

00:01:20,235 --> 00:01:22,470
he seemed more mature
than he really was,

00:01:22,537 --> 00:01:24,172
he swept you off your feet,

00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:26,641
and, uh, he let you fall.

00:01:26,708 --> 00:01:29,311
Bruised, but not broken.

00:01:29,377 --> 00:01:31,813
Get you another one?

00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,049
No, I'm good, thanks.

00:01:35,684 --> 00:01:37,085
So you're divorced?

00:01:41,323 --> 00:01:43,258
You?

00:01:43,325 --> 00:01:44,492
Yeah.

00:01:44,559 --> 00:01:46,361
She seemed more mature
than she really was,

00:01:46,428 --> 00:01:47,562
swept me off my feet.

00:01:47,629 --> 00:01:48,730
( <i>laughs</i> )

00:01:48,797 --> 00:01:49,931
Kids?

00:01:49,998 --> 00:01:53,268
Uh, yes, I have a daughter.

00:01:53,335 --> 00:01:56,238
If she's got her mother's looks,
you're in trouble.

00:01:58,006 --> 00:02:00,041
( <i>whispering</i> )

00:02:03,745 --> 00:02:06,348
( <i>chuckling</i> )

00:02:06,414 --> 00:02:08,917
If I don't get home soon,
I will be in trouble.

00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:13,955
Thanks. I needed this.

00:02:14,022 --> 00:02:16,458
If you're blowing me off,
no worries.

00:02:16,525 --> 00:02:18,793
But if you're not...

00:02:23,298 --> 00:02:24,966
...give me a call.

00:02:30,138 --> 00:02:31,406
Wait a second.

00:02:31,473 --> 00:02:33,909
Let me walk you to your car.

00:02:39,781 --> 00:02:42,017
( <i>moaning</i> )

00:02:44,619 --> 00:02:46,821
I can't do this tonight. I...

00:02:46,888 --> 00:02:48,089
I'll call you.

00:02:49,224 --> 00:02:51,026
What the hell
is your problem?

00:02:53,628 --> 00:02:56,131
( <i>grunts softly</i> )

00:02:56,198 --> 00:02:58,166
Go to hell.

00:03:00,001 --> 00:03:01,469
( <i>Catherine groans</i> )

00:03:02,904 --> 00:03:04,166
( <i>exhales</i> )

00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:06,208
You're not worth
the trouble.

00:03:06,274 --> 00:03:08,443
( <i>panting</i> )

00:03:13,982 --> 00:03:16,818

( <i>phone beeps</i> )

00:03:25,994 --> 00:03:28,263
Hello.

00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:31,299
( <i>whispering</i> ):
Mom, Mom.

00:03:31,366 --> 00:03:32,968
Grissom just called.
I've got to go in.

00:03:33,034 --> 00:03:34,169
I'm backing up grave.

00:03:34,236 --> 00:03:35,537
( <i>sniffs</i> )
What?

00:03:35,604 --> 00:03:38,707
Vodka, with an Altoid chaser.

00:03:38,773 --> 00:03:40,709
I brushed my teeth.

00:03:40,775 --> 00:03:44,412
What did you do,
walk into a door?

00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:46,147
Hey, listen,

00:03:46,214 --> 00:03:48,316
Lindsey's got a dentist
appointment before school.

00:03:48,383 --> 00:03:50,418
I wrote all the information
down in the kitchen.

00:03:50,485 --> 00:03:52,087
Okay.
Okay?

00:03:52,153 --> 00:03:53,321
Thank you.

00:03:53,388 --> 00:03:55,390
Oh, good grief.

00:03:55,457 --> 00:03:57,626

00:04:15,911 --> 00:04:17,045
I appreciate this.

00:04:17,112 --> 00:04:18,213
Everyone's out.

00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,681
I'm short.

00:04:19,748 --> 00:04:22,217
You're welcome.

00:04:23,752 --> 00:04:24,853
( <i>camera shutter clicking</i> )

Clotted blood hasn't
retracted yet.

00:04:26,755 --> 00:04:28,590
She hasn't been dead long.

00:04:28,657 --> 00:04:29,858
We have an I.D.?

00:04:29,925 --> 00:04:32,460
Yeah, building manager
took a peek.

00:04:32,527 --> 00:04:34,496
ID'd her as Alice Granger.

00:04:34,563 --> 00:04:35,764
Apartment 207.

00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,532
Moved here about
a month ago.

00:04:37,599 --> 00:04:39,501
David,

00:04:39,568 --> 00:04:41,570
you want to take the, uh,
jacket off her face?

00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:55,850
What happened to you?

00:04:55,917 --> 00:04:57,519
I walked into a door.

00:04:57,586 --> 00:04:59,588
Can we not talk about it?

00:05:01,089 --> 00:05:02,123
Gunshot.

00:05:03,925 --> 00:05:05,660
Looks like
a small caliber weapon.

00:05:07,462 --> 00:05:09,965
No cartridge casings.

00:05:10,031 --> 00:05:12,267
No purse, no car.

00:05:12,334 --> 00:05:13,435
I put out a BOLO.

00:05:13,501 --> 00:05:14,736
Possible car jacking.

00:05:14,803 --> 00:05:18,173
( <i>whimpering and crying</i> )

00:05:19,674 --> 00:05:21,910
( <i>gunshot</i> )

00:05:23,845 --> 00:05:25,847
Usually when a killer
covers the victim's face,

00:05:25,914 --> 00:05:27,849
it suggests familiarity.

00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:29,618
An act of
contrition.

00:05:33,488 --> 00:05:35,390
Maybe she knew her attacker.

00:05:35,457 --> 00:05:38,159
Great. Carjacked by a friend.

00:05:38,226 --> 00:05:39,661
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

00:05:39,728 --> 00:05:42,397

00:05:42,464 --> 00:05:43,865
Yeah, got it.

00:05:43,932 --> 00:05:45,901
We got a 20 on her car.

00:05:45,967 --> 00:05:48,370
You go, I'll stay with the body,
I'll meet you there.

00:05:50,338 --> 00:05:52,374
( <i>sirens wailing</i> )

00:06:11,359 --> 00:06:12,861
You see anybody
get out of the car?

00:06:12,928 --> 00:06:14,863
No, sir.
Saw it on patrol.

00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:16,364
You checked
the bar?
I waited for you.

00:06:16,431 --> 00:06:17,766
No one's exited
since we got here.

00:06:17,832 --> 00:06:19,834
Okay, I'll
see you inside.

00:06:23,538 --> 00:06:25,740
Can you open it up?

00:06:34,015 --> 00:06:36,084
Thank you.

00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,923
( <i>garbled radio transmission</i> )

00:06:52,901 --> 00:06:55,604
I found a gun under the seat.

00:06:56,638 --> 00:06:59,274
.22 Beretta.

00:06:59,341 --> 00:07:01,142
Well, that's small
enough to be the weapon.

00:07:01,209 --> 00:07:02,244
VARTANN:
So he shoots her,

00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:04,079
takes her car,

00:07:04,145 --> 00:07:06,448
and stops off for a drink.

00:07:06,514 --> 00:07:07,816
He could still be in there.

00:07:09,317 --> 00:07:11,319
VARTANN:
Let's find out.

00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:16,992
Did you hear the one
about the cop and the monkey

00:07:17,058 --> 00:07:18,159
who walk into a bar?

00:07:18,226 --> 00:07:20,262
I'm not in the mood.

00:07:20,328 --> 00:07:22,030

VARTANN:
Hi. You recognize
this girl?

00:08:24,006 --> 00:08:25,207
WOMAN:
Yeah. She's been in

00:08:25,274 --> 00:08:27,009
a few times.
How about last night?

00:08:27,075 --> 00:08:28,477
Yeah.

00:08:29,745 --> 00:08:31,246
Throwing them back
pretty good, too.

00:08:31,313 --> 00:08:32,581
You see anybody hassle her?

00:08:32,648 --> 00:08:34,349
She was getting
a lot of attention.

00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:36,385
She didn't really
seem to mind.

00:08:36,451 --> 00:08:38,086
Did you see her leave
with anyone?

00:08:38,153 --> 00:08:39,921
No. She was wasted.

00:08:39,988 --> 00:08:41,523
Had me call
her a cab.

00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:42,758
VARTANN:
Around what time?

00:08:42,824 --> 00:08:43,825
We were
really slammed.

00:08:43,892 --> 00:08:46,395
Maybe 2:00... 2:30.

00:08:46,461 --> 00:08:47,696
Which cab company?

00:08:47,763 --> 00:08:48,530
Lucky Cab.

00:08:48,597 --> 00:08:49,298
Well, that would explain

00:08:49,364 --> 00:08:50,365
why her car's still here.

00:08:50,432 --> 00:08:51,800
Doesn't explain the gun.

00:08:56,071 --> 00:08:57,172
( <i>whispering</i> ):
Thank you.

00:08:57,239 --> 00:08:59,308
Why? Do I know you?

00:09:00,976 --> 00:09:04,646
ROBBINS:
I dug it out of the right
frontal cortex.

00:09:04,713 --> 00:09:08,951
The bullet lacerated
the right occipital lobe.

00:09:09,017 --> 00:09:11,219
It crossed the mid-line,

00:09:11,286 --> 00:09:14,122
destroying the vital structures
of the brain

00:09:14,189 --> 00:09:16,458
and bounced off
the left frontal calvarium.

00:09:16,525 --> 00:09:18,827
Hmm.

00:09:18,894 --> 00:09:21,129
This is a .25 caliber.

00:09:21,196 --> 00:09:22,197
What, disappointed?

00:09:22,264 --> 00:09:24,066
We found a .22
in the victim's car.

00:09:24,132 --> 00:09:26,101
This just ruled that out
as the murder weapon.

00:09:26,168 --> 00:09:27,369
So shoot me.

00:09:27,436 --> 00:09:31,073
Stellate tear
means close contact.

00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:34,343
See the muzzle impression
around the entrance wound?

00:09:38,513 --> 00:09:40,482
This could help identify
the firearm.

00:09:45,354 --> 00:09:48,290
This is an unusual
point of entry.

00:09:48,357 --> 00:09:49,891
Yeah, I measured the trajectory.

00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:51,627
Ten to 15 degrees
left of vertical.

00:09:51,693 --> 00:09:53,595
Shooter would have
to be standing over her.

00:09:53,662 --> 00:09:56,264
Which would make him a giant,
except for this.

00:09:57,733 --> 00:09:59,868
Abrasions on her knees.

00:10:02,004 --> 00:10:05,040
So... maybe she was kneeling.

00:10:05,107 --> 00:10:08,343
Begging for her life.

00:10:09,411 --> 00:10:10,579

tells me I'd
have better luck

with a blue suit
than a gray suit.

00:10:14,483 --> 00:10:16,451
What is that?
Do you think
he meant that?

00:10:16,518 --> 00:10:19,121
Do you think he was
flirting with me or...?

00:10:19,187 --> 00:10:21,189
I thought judges were supposed
to be color blind.

00:10:21,256 --> 00:10:22,824
SIDLE:
Yeah, right.

00:10:22,891 --> 00:10:24,326
That's cute.

00:10:38,173 --> 00:10:42,044
credit card, car keys,
lipstick and one matchbook.

00:10:45,013 --> 00:10:46,381
Can I see that?

00:10:46,448 --> 00:10:48,150
There's no name,
just a phone number.

00:10:50,252 --> 00:10:52,054
Give me a call.

00:10:54,456 --> 00:10:55,991
I'll have Vartann run it down.

00:10:57,859 --> 00:11:00,228
You know, I've got to
go pick up Lindsey.

00:11:00,295 --> 00:11:01,296
Could you cover for me?

00:11:01,363 --> 00:11:02,331
Sure.

00:11:02,397 --> 00:11:03,398
WILLOWS:
Thanks.

00:11:03,465 --> 00:11:05,334
Tell her I said, "Hey."

00:11:23,852 --> 00:11:25,087
Lindsey!

00:11:25,153 --> 00:11:26,254
Yeah.

00:11:26,321 --> 00:11:27,522
What happened to the trash?

00:11:27,589 --> 00:11:29,391
I took it out, like
you always tell me to.

00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:31,426
It's Thursday.

00:11:31,493 --> 00:11:32,527
Uh, hello,
Mom, you okay?

00:11:32,594 --> 00:11:34,262
Yeah, I'm great.

00:11:34,329 --> 00:11:36,198
Are you sure about that?

00:11:36,264 --> 00:11:37,766
You want me
to be the babysitter,

00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:39,835
but you want me
to be deaf and blind, too?

00:11:39,901 --> 00:11:41,236
Can't get into
this now, Mother.

00:11:41,303 --> 00:11:43,639
I'm in a jam.
You haven't seen
your daughter all week.

00:11:43,705 --> 00:11:45,407
Save the sermon.

00:11:45,474 --> 00:11:47,809
I was a working mother,
too, you know?

00:11:47,876 --> 00:11:50,445
( <i>to herself</i> ):
There but for
the grace of God...

00:11:50,512 --> 00:11:52,014
Don't just assume

00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,017
that my time
means nothing to me.

00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:56,451
Damn it.
Catherine?

00:11:56,518 --> 00:11:57,919
I threw something away.
It's gone.

00:11:57,986 --> 00:12:00,922
( <i>cell phone rings</i> )
You're throwing
more than you know away.

00:12:04,326 --> 00:12:05,994
Yeah?

00:12:06,061 --> 00:12:08,330
Uh...

00:12:08,397 --> 00:12:09,898
Yeah, just wait
till I get there.

00:12:09,965 --> 00:12:12,634
Yeah.

00:12:12,701 --> 00:12:15,771
Mom...
Go. Go.

00:12:15,837 --> 00:12:18,407
I'll be here
when you get back.

00:12:35,223 --> 00:12:37,059
Results from
Alice Granger's jacket.

00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:40,462
Found trace elements of iron,
chromium, manganese and carbon.

00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:41,430
Metals.

00:12:41,496 --> 00:12:43,498
More specific,
automotive sheet metal.

00:12:43,565 --> 00:12:45,233
The metallic balls
would've been

00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,102
released into the air
during the welding process.

00:12:47,169 --> 00:12:49,972
( <i>buzzing</i> )

00:12:50,038 --> 00:12:52,774
So you're saying
our killer has metal balls?

00:12:52,841 --> 00:12:55,344
Yes... maybe.

00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:58,614
Turns out that the victim
worked in a car dealership,

00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,516
so she could've gotten
metal balls on the job.

00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:04,086
And just in case
you're wondering,

00:13:04,152 --> 00:13:07,055
working here,
I'm developing them, too.

00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,298
Yo.

00:13:16,365 --> 00:13:18,867
Oh. What do you
have for me?

00:13:18,934 --> 00:13:22,371
Bullet is a .25 auto caliber
Winchester full metal jacket.

00:13:22,437 --> 00:13:25,040
You can't shoot .25s
from a .22 caliber pistol.

00:13:25,107 --> 00:13:26,375
I know.

00:13:26,441 --> 00:13:29,378
Which means the semi-automatic
you found in Alice Granger's car

00:13:29,444 --> 00:13:30,712
isn't the murder weapon.

00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:31,713
I know.

00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,048
Okay, well, did you know

00:13:33,115 --> 00:13:35,751
that the gun is registered
to a Douglas Granger?

00:13:46,561 --> 00:13:49,164
I don't understand why
you're asking me this.

00:13:49,231 --> 00:13:51,566
I'm her brother,
not her husband.

00:13:51,633 --> 00:13:53,268
You still own
a lot of guns.

00:13:53,335 --> 00:13:56,038
A .22 pistol,
Colt .25,
among others.

00:13:56,104 --> 00:13:58,006
That's right.

00:13:58,073 --> 00:14:00,342
We found the .22 in Alice's car.

00:14:00,409 --> 00:14:01,977
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:14:02,044 --> 00:14:03,445
If she carried it in her purse

00:14:03,512 --> 00:14:05,047
instead of leaving it
in the car,

00:14:05,113 --> 00:14:06,381
she might still be alive.

00:14:08,784 --> 00:14:09,885
I don't follow.

00:14:09,952 --> 00:14:11,386
I gave her the gun last week.

00:14:11,453 --> 00:14:12,387
Then what?

00:14:12,454 --> 00:14:13,655
You shot her with your .25?

00:14:13,722 --> 00:14:14,656
Are you insane?

00:14:14,723 --> 00:14:16,525
It's no mystery

00:14:16,591 --> 00:14:18,126
who killed her.

00:14:18,193 --> 00:14:21,730
Jeff Simon, her ex-boyfriend.
Guy was stalking her.

00:14:21,797 --> 00:14:23,598
She changed her
phone number,

00:14:23,665 --> 00:14:25,067
changed jobs,

00:14:25,133 --> 00:14:26,268
moved a half dozen times.

00:14:26,335 --> 00:14:28,170
No matter where she went,
there he was.

00:14:28,236 --> 00:14:30,539
Last week, I was over
at her new apartment.

00:14:30,606 --> 00:14:31,907
Jerk sitting in his car,

00:14:31,974 --> 00:14:33,408
in front of the building.

00:14:33,475 --> 00:14:35,611
Is that when you
gave her the gun?

00:14:35,677 --> 00:14:36,778
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:14:36,845 --> 00:14:38,880
Taught her how to shoot it.

00:14:38,947 --> 00:14:40,582
Helped her get
a restraining order.

00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:42,684
Got zero help
from you guys.

00:14:42,751 --> 00:14:45,053
"Catch him in the act."
That's all we heard.

00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,922
You know where we can
find Jeff Simon?

00:14:46,989 --> 00:14:49,124
Yeah.

00:14:49,191 --> 00:14:50,826
We used to be friends.

00:14:52,861 --> 00:14:55,864
( <i>distant tool buzzing</i> )

00:15:06,675 --> 00:15:09,011
( <i>buzzing grows louder</i> )

00:15:11,046 --> 00:15:13,949
Hey, I'm looking
for Jeff Simon.

00:15:16,952 --> 00:15:18,920
( <i>loud buzzing</i> )

00:15:19,921 --> 00:15:21,823
( <i>turns off saw</i> )

00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:24,960
Jeff Simon?

00:15:25,027 --> 00:15:26,194
Are you Jeff Simon?

00:15:26,261 --> 00:15:27,262
Yeah.

00:15:30,465 --> 00:15:32,134
When's the last time
you saw Alice Granger?

00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,769
Before the restraining
order kicked in.

00:15:33,835 --> 00:15:35,070
Come on.

00:15:35,137 --> 00:15:37,572
This is just a big
misunderstanding, Officer.

00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:38,774
Well, I'm glad
you feel that way.

00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,309
You mind if we take
a look in your truck?

00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:42,110
What did Alice say I did now?

00:15:42,177 --> 00:15:43,312
Where is it?

00:15:49,484 --> 00:15:51,286
I don't get a break
for another half hour.

00:15:51,353 --> 00:15:53,055
Look, we can get a court order.

00:15:55,424 --> 00:15:57,626
You can look
anywhere you want.

00:15:57,693 --> 00:16:00,062
Just give Alice
a message for me.

00:16:00,128 --> 00:16:02,965
I love her, and
I want her back.

00:16:06,535 --> 00:16:08,870
Look, buddy, she's dead.

00:16:23,552 --> 00:16:27,222
What the...

00:16:27,289 --> 00:16:30,459
I swear, I haven't been...

00:16:30,525 --> 00:16:33,261
I haven't been anywhere near her
since her brother broke us up.

00:16:35,297 --> 00:16:37,299
I'm gonna check out his truck.

00:17:23,478 --> 00:17:26,615
( <i>beeping</i> )

00:17:31,186 --> 00:17:33,855
( <i>speed dialing</i> )

00:17:33,922 --> 00:17:39,461
Gil, the suspect has a laptop in
his vehicle that has a GPS unit

00:17:39,528 --> 00:17:41,096
that's honed in on the lab.

00:17:41,163 --> 00:17:44,533
Well, you can't track
a static location.

00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:46,234
It has to be something mobile.

00:17:46,301 --> 00:17:48,303
I know. That's why I'm calling.

00:18:33,649 --> 00:18:35,183
( <i>phone rings</i> )

00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,184
Yeah.

00:18:36,251 --> 00:18:37,019
GRISSOM:
You were right.

00:18:37,085 --> 00:18:38,854
We found a GPS transmitter

00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,356
under the rear bumper
of the girl's car.

00:18:41,423 --> 00:18:43,091
Thanks.

00:18:46,495 --> 00:18:48,230
He was tracking her car.

00:18:49,431 --> 00:18:50,632
Let's bring him in.

00:18:52,367 --> 00:18:53,969
Get up.

00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:01,484
You are a real prize.

00:19:01,551 --> 00:19:03,886
Jeff, your prints
are all over that box,

00:19:03,953 --> 00:19:06,889
which means one count
felony stalking.

00:19:06,956 --> 00:19:08,224
That's seven to ten.

00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:11,227
Murder two adds a quarter.

00:19:11,294 --> 00:19:15,064
Now, you plead out now,
you'll live to see parole.

00:19:15,131 --> 00:19:16,566
I didn't kill Alice.

00:19:16,633 --> 00:19:18,234
I loved her.

00:19:18,301 --> 00:19:19,435
Is that your idea of love?

00:19:19,502 --> 00:19:21,037
Stalking her with a GPS unit?

00:19:21,104 --> 00:19:23,306
I wasn't stalking her.

00:19:23,373 --> 00:19:24,307
I wo-worried about her.

00:19:24,374 --> 00:19:25,475
So that
restraining order

00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:26,609
she filed against you was

00:19:26,676 --> 00:19:27,810
because you're a nice guy.

00:19:27,877 --> 00:19:30,013
Let me tell you about Alice.

00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:32,982
She... liked to party...

00:19:35,218 --> 00:19:38,721
<i>...barely ate, hardly slept,</i>

00:19:38,788 --> 00:19:43,393
<i>didn't want to admit</i>
<i>she had a drinking problem.</i>

00:19:44,761 --> 00:19:47,096
She needed me to
look out for her.

00:19:47,163 --> 00:19:50,400
Well, there's a problem with
your story. She called a cab.

00:19:50,466 --> 00:19:55,271
I'm telling you, Alice got
into a Chrysler or... a Buick?

00:19:55,338 --> 00:19:57,040
It was blue,
maybe black.

00:19:57,106 --> 00:19:58,841
And the guy
she was with,

00:19:58,908 --> 00:20:01,210
maniac driver. Complete

00:20:01,277 --> 00:20:02,345
moron.

00:20:02,412 --> 00:20:04,814
Wait, wait. You...
you followed them?

00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:08,718
I had to.

00:20:08,785 --> 00:20:12,889
But I was pulled
over by the cops.

00:20:12,956 --> 00:20:16,960
They kept me on-on the side
of the road for over an hour.

00:20:17,026 --> 00:20:18,194
What time was this?

00:20:18,261 --> 00:20:19,362
It was around 2:00.

00:20:19,429 --> 00:20:20,697
It was a buck-fifty ticket.

00:20:20,763 --> 00:20:21,965
I'm innocent.

00:20:22,031 --> 00:20:23,132
Cut the crap.

00:20:23,199 --> 00:20:24,200
We found trace amounts

00:20:24,267 --> 00:20:26,202
of automotive sheet metal
on her clothing.

00:20:26,269 --> 00:20:27,236
You work around cars.

00:20:27,303 --> 00:20:28,771
If Alice picked it up from you,

00:20:28,838 --> 00:20:30,273
you were in violation
of the T.R.O.

00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,407
Lady, until we broke up,

00:20:31,474 --> 00:20:33,176
we spent every waking minute
together.

00:20:33,242 --> 00:20:34,444
She'd come over to my shop

00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:36,145
on her lunch break
just to get some.

00:20:36,212 --> 00:20:38,047
It was over, Jeff.

00:20:38,114 --> 00:20:40,917
She didn't want you to be
her lover, her protector.

00:20:40,984 --> 00:20:43,319
She didn't want you
within a hundred yards.

00:20:43,386 --> 00:20:45,922
Whatever trace
from you we found
on her was fresh.

00:20:45,989 --> 00:20:47,790
She worked around cars, too.

00:20:47,857 --> 00:20:50,126
I'm telling you, I'm innocent!

00:20:50,193 --> 00:20:53,496
You were living a fantasy,
thinking you still had a chance.

00:20:53,563 --> 00:20:55,565
When reality set in,
you killed her.

00:20:55,632 --> 00:20:58,935
I only did one thing wrong.

00:20:59,002 --> 00:21:02,038
I didn't protect her
from that guy.

00:21:02,105 --> 00:21:04,007
What did this guy
look like?

00:21:04,073 --> 00:21:06,075
Sleazy bastard.

00:21:06,142 --> 00:21:08,378
Slight build, dark hair.

00:21:08,444 --> 00:21:11,347
I think he had a leather jacket.

00:21:14,984 --> 00:21:18,454
( <i>chuckling</i> )

Okay.

Do you have a minute?

00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:34,336
I got a problem in DNA.

Okay, uh, it really is
only gonna take a minute.

00:21:37,072 --> 00:21:40,842

a conversation with you.

( <i>sighs</i> )

00:21:42,577 --> 00:21:44,513
I processed the swabs
from the wife

00:21:44,579 --> 00:21:46,915
who found her husband
in the hooker case.

00:21:46,982 --> 00:21:47,916
Right.

00:21:47,983 --> 00:21:49,084
Two contributions.

00:21:49,151 --> 00:21:50,452
Two?

00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:52,054
One was a match
to the wife's DNA.

00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,056
The other was from
an unknown male.

00:21:54,122 --> 00:21:55,991
I found the same unknown
male contribution

00:21:56,058 --> 00:21:58,093
on the swabs from the
Alice Granger homicide.

00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,595
Well, it's unlikely
that they're connected.
They're not.

00:22:00,662 --> 00:22:02,597
I also matched that
unknown male contribution

00:22:02,664 --> 00:22:04,066
to a rape kit
from the day shift.

00:22:04,132 --> 00:22:05,500
Cross contamination?

00:22:05,567 --> 00:22:07,035
That's why I raised the alarm.

00:22:07,102 --> 00:22:10,305
I was able to narrow the time
frame to the last 48 hours.

00:22:10,372 --> 00:22:13,275
Are you saying that all the DNA
evidence from the last two days

00:22:13,341 --> 00:22:14,676
has to be resubmitted
and retested?

00:22:14,743 --> 00:22:15,911
We don't have any choice.

00:22:15,977 --> 00:22:18,013
It's potentially
all contaminated.

00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,549
Document everything.

00:22:27,556 --> 00:22:29,491
Hey. Your suspect,
Jeff Simon,

00:22:29,558 --> 00:22:31,660
just got released
from custody.

00:22:34,229 --> 00:22:36,364
How the hell did that happen?

00:22:36,431 --> 00:22:37,799
His alibi checked out.

00:22:37,866 --> 00:22:39,367
I talked to the cop
who pulled him over

00:22:39,434 --> 00:22:43,038
for speeding, at 2:15 a.m.,
right around T.O.D.

00:22:43,105 --> 00:22:44,906
It's proof he lost track of her.

00:22:44,973 --> 00:22:46,274
They jammed him
for over an hour.

00:22:46,341 --> 00:22:48,710
I mean, made him walk the line,
gave him a breathalyzer,

00:22:48,777 --> 00:22:50,946
the whole nine.
Guy confessed to stalking.

00:22:51,012 --> 00:22:52,514
At least you
got him on that.

00:22:52,581 --> 00:22:54,216
Which they'll
probably kick down

00:22:54,282 --> 00:22:56,151
to a misdemeanor
because she's dead.

00:22:56,218 --> 00:22:59,187
Hey. Phone number
on the matchbook panned out.

00:22:59,254 --> 00:23:00,856
Guy's on his way
to P.D.

00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:03,191
You got a name?

00:23:06,194 --> 00:23:08,663
Was it necessary to
show up at my office?

00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:09,998
Try the phone.

00:23:10,065 --> 00:23:11,466
I'm an officer
of the court.

00:23:11,533 --> 00:23:14,136
Mr. Novak...

00:23:14,202 --> 00:23:16,204
do you recognize
this telephone number?

00:23:16,872 --> 00:23:18,440
That's my work number.

00:23:18,507 --> 00:23:20,142
Did you write it
on the matchbook?

00:23:20,208 --> 00:23:22,310
I may have. What's this about?

00:23:22,377 --> 00:23:23,545
A homicide.

00:23:23,612 --> 00:23:25,213
That matchbook
was found

00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,748
in a dead
woman's pocket.

00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:30,652
This the only evidence
linking me to the victim?

00:23:30,719 --> 00:23:31,653
This will go
much easier

00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,055
if you just answer
our questions.

00:23:33,121 --> 00:23:35,590
Oh, yeah? Easier for whom?

00:23:35,657 --> 00:23:36,925
Why didn't you
write your name on it?

00:23:36,992 --> 00:23:38,894
I'm a memorable guy.

00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,195
Why not your home number?

00:23:40,262 --> 00:23:41,463
This is getting tedious.

00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:44,099
At bars, I give out my work
number to weed out the crazies.

00:23:47,769 --> 00:23:50,172
This is Alice Granger.

00:23:50,238 --> 00:23:51,506
Do you know her?

00:23:54,676 --> 00:23:57,179
I bought her a drink last night.

00:23:58,847 --> 00:24:00,782
VARTANN:
Okay, why don't you, uh,

00:24:00,849 --> 00:24:03,452
walk us through your evening?

00:24:03,518 --> 00:24:05,520
Start with
"I left the office..."

00:24:05,587 --> 00:24:07,322
I was deposing a witness.

00:24:07,389 --> 00:24:08,924
Left the office late.

00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:10,192
Stopped at
the Peppermill

00:24:10,258 --> 00:24:11,293
for a burger.

00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:12,127
Medium rare.

00:24:12,194 --> 00:24:13,462
No onions.

00:24:13,528 --> 00:24:15,430
Got to The Highball
around 11:00.

00:24:17,099 --> 00:24:18,366
Met this redhead.

00:24:18,433 --> 00:24:20,102
Bought her a drink and...

00:24:24,806 --> 00:24:25,741
( <i>clearing throat</i> )

00:24:25,807 --> 00:24:27,042
Mr. Novak...

00:24:27,109 --> 00:24:30,379
I'm Catherine Willows.

00:24:30,445 --> 00:24:32,314
CSI.

00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:38,587
You want to know
what happened next?

00:24:38,653 --> 00:24:40,155
Ask the redhead.

00:24:47,792 --> 00:24:49,750
At a bar that time of night,

00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:51,718
we're all after
the same thing, aren't we?

00:24:51,785 --> 00:24:53,387
I came onto her.

00:24:53,453 --> 00:24:55,355
She was into me.

00:24:55,422 --> 00:24:56,657
I know when a woman
is going to give way

00:24:56,723 --> 00:25:00,494
and believe me,
she was <i>there.</i>

00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,262
And then what?

00:25:03,297 --> 00:25:05,999
I walked her out.

00:25:06,066 --> 00:25:07,334
I put my arm
around her waist.

00:25:07,401 --> 00:25:10,003
She moved in.

00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:12,339
One minute she's got
her tongue down my throat.

00:25:12,406 --> 00:25:15,342
The next, she puts
on the brakes.

00:25:15,409 --> 00:25:17,678
She's a bitch
and a tease.

00:25:20,681 --> 00:25:23,016
We should ask
for his clothes.

00:25:23,083 --> 00:25:27,988
Black leather jacket,
black T-shirt, jeans.

00:25:28,055 --> 00:25:32,359
What else should we
ask him, Catherine?

00:25:32,426 --> 00:25:34,027
This is what I was
trying to tell you.

00:25:34,094 --> 00:25:37,097
Yeah, but you didn't,
so now I'm way behind.

00:25:38,765 --> 00:25:40,767
Is he telling the truth?

00:25:43,103 --> 00:25:46,907
He's not lying about anything
that pertains to me.

00:25:49,309 --> 00:25:50,577
He hit you.

00:25:50,644 --> 00:25:53,113
No, it was an accident.

00:25:54,448 --> 00:25:58,852
But... by the time it happened,

00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:03,190
he wasn't who I thought
he was, and...

00:26:03,257 --> 00:26:04,591
that scared me.

00:26:08,208 --> 00:26:09,943
VARTANN:
Eyewitness claimed that a man

00:26:10,009 --> 00:26:12,579
matching your description left
the bar with the victim.

00:26:12,645 --> 00:26:17,083
Drove off in
a dark-colored, four-door sedan.

00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:19,686
What do you drive, Mr. Novak?

00:26:19,753 --> 00:26:20,687
Look,

00:26:20,754 --> 00:26:23,690
I'm innocent,

00:26:23,757 --> 00:26:25,725
but it's in my best interest
to retain counsel.

00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:27,227
We're done here.

00:26:34,901 --> 00:26:36,369
You have to
recuse yourself

00:26:36,436 --> 00:26:37,837
from processing evidence

00:26:37,904 --> 00:26:39,038
This guy's a lawyer.

00:26:39,105 --> 00:26:40,840
He could claim
prejudicial treatment.

00:26:40,907 --> 00:26:43,176
Your whole life
will become public record.

00:26:43,243 --> 00:26:44,711
I have nothing
to be ashamed of.

00:26:44,778 --> 00:26:46,379
We all live
in glass houses, Catherine.

00:26:46,446 --> 00:26:48,581
You gotta be careful
where you take your shower.

00:26:51,451 --> 00:26:52,786
Catherine.

00:26:56,055 --> 00:27:00,927
Just walk me through your
interaction with the suspect.

00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:03,396
I met Adam
Novak in a bar

00:27:03,463 --> 00:27:04,597
called The Highball.

00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:06,099
Were you drinking?

00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:09,169
I had one cocktail, on his tab.

00:27:09,235 --> 00:27:11,304
He walked me out to my car.

00:27:11,371 --> 00:27:13,139
Things got physical.

00:27:13,206 --> 00:27:15,809
Could you
define "physical"?

00:27:15,875 --> 00:27:19,312
I believe that I outlined
the specifics in my memo.

00:27:19,379 --> 00:27:20,980
Catherine, you know
what I'm asking,

00:27:21,047 --> 00:27:22,248
and it's not in the memo.

00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:24,818
I didn't have sex with him,

00:27:24,884 --> 00:27:26,453
though he clearly wanted it.

00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:27,654
And you didn't?

00:27:29,889 --> 00:27:31,724
I went out
after shift to unwind.

00:27:31,791 --> 00:27:34,427
I even invited Warrick
and Nick to come along.

00:27:34,494 --> 00:27:35,795
They had other plans.

00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:39,365
All right. So...
when you put on the brakes,

00:27:39,432 --> 00:27:42,435
Mr. Novak... got angry.

00:27:43,236 --> 00:27:45,171
Yeah.

00:27:45,238 --> 00:27:47,173
I got into my car.

00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,742
He went back inside.

00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:02,655
Hey, El, will you do me
a favor and call me a cab?

00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:03,857
Thanks.

00:28:06,926 --> 00:28:09,329
This is just a theory, but...

00:28:09,395 --> 00:28:11,798
she was drunk,

00:28:11,865 --> 00:28:14,801
probably more compliant
than I was.

00:28:14,868 --> 00:28:16,469
He walked her outside.

00:28:16,536 --> 00:28:19,205
He waited with her for the taxi,

00:28:19,272 --> 00:28:21,141
offered her a ride.

00:28:21,207 --> 00:28:22,542
BROWN:
I hate to break
up the party.

00:28:22,609 --> 00:28:24,177
Catherine,
you got a 419

00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:25,678
in Seven Hills.

00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:27,680
I'll grab the kits
and meet you outside.

00:28:30,016 --> 00:28:31,751
We'll finish
this later?

00:28:31,818 --> 00:28:33,653
Guess we'll have to.

00:28:45,231 --> 00:28:47,834
Look familiar?

00:28:47,901 --> 00:28:49,035
Yeah.

00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:50,837
Like the other night.

00:28:50,904 --> 00:28:53,239
You got an I.D. on the vic?

00:28:53,306 --> 00:28:55,175
Yeah. Holly Pearson, 31, single.

00:28:55,241 --> 00:28:56,910
She lived across the street.

00:28:56,976 --> 00:28:58,945
Car was locked.

00:28:59,012 --> 00:29:00,647
Keys and purse
were accounted for.

00:29:00,713 --> 00:29:03,016
Found them in the mailbox
along with her mail.

00:29:03,083 --> 00:29:05,118
WARRICK:
Any indication of
sexual assault?

00:29:05,185 --> 00:29:08,321
Well, her clothes
and underwear are undisturbed.

00:29:08,388 --> 00:29:09,722
Can you remove the jacket?

00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:10,824
Sure.

00:29:19,532 --> 00:29:22,135
Looks like
a small-caliber gunshot wound...

00:29:22,202 --> 00:29:23,536
like the first victim.

00:29:23,603 --> 00:29:26,172
Location of the entry
wound is different.

00:29:29,876 --> 00:29:31,878
Slug's still inside her.

00:29:35,882 --> 00:29:37,784
Grave is working
a case with similarities.

00:29:37,851 --> 00:29:39,152
That victim

00:29:39,219 --> 00:29:42,388
left a bar called The Highball

00:29:42,455 --> 00:29:44,724
shortly before
she was killed.

00:29:44,791 --> 00:29:47,794
I'm wondering
if Holly went out last night.

00:29:47,861 --> 00:29:48,895
I'm on it.

00:29:50,029 --> 00:29:51,231
Thanks.

00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,175
There's two sets
of shoe prints...

00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:06,913
With a bit of distance
between the strides.

00:30:07,981 --> 00:30:09,749
Which means
they were both running.

00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:16,022
BROWN:
Got some shell casings.

00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:19,092
Well, there's
only one shot

00:30:19,159 --> 00:30:20,693
fired in Grissom's case.

00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:22,395
It was close contact.

00:30:22,462 --> 00:30:23,496
He couldn't miss.

00:30:23,563 --> 00:30:25,198
I'm thinking that
she was attacked

00:30:25,265 --> 00:30:26,933
near her house...

00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,436
and then made a run for it.

00:30:34,274 --> 00:30:35,542
( <i>gunshots</i> )

00:30:51,758 --> 00:30:54,661
Got a courthouse keycard.

00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:58,064
For the parking lot.

00:30:58,131 --> 00:31:00,567
I wonder where
Holly Pearson works.

00:31:00,633 --> 00:31:02,836
Adam Novak's a
public defender.

00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:05,305
Let's run his prints
against this.

00:31:05,371 --> 00:31:06,973
Guys? I found
a couple

00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,008
of the victim's
coworkers.

00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:10,844
They said she was
at The Highball last night.

00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,245
Got them coming
into PD.

00:31:13,947 --> 00:31:15,915
Holly was just promoted.

00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:20,186
Youngest systems
analyst at the bank

00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:22,388
and we were celebrating.

00:31:22,455 --> 00:31:26,392
She wasn't exactly
a party animal.

00:31:26,459 --> 00:31:29,028
We practically
forced her to go out.

00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:32,499
Any guys come on strong?

00:31:32,565 --> 00:31:35,835
Yeah. We collected
numbers all night.

00:31:35,902 --> 00:31:39,205
Anyone write their number
on a matchbook?

00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:43,376
I got, uh... business cards.

00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:47,313
So... you're having
a good time and...

00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:49,582
Holly had had enough.

00:31:49,649 --> 00:31:51,885
Yeah. We carpooled,

00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:54,154
so she took a cab home.

00:31:55,188 --> 00:31:57,857
I'd like to show you
some pictures.

00:31:57,924 --> 00:32:01,694
See if you recognize anyone.

00:32:02,729 --> 00:32:03,730
( <i>sniffles</i> )

00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,775
He bought us a round.

00:32:17,277 --> 00:32:19,112
He tried to get friendly.

00:32:19,179 --> 00:32:21,815
When Holly left,
did you see that man again?

00:32:23,583 --> 00:32:25,251
Actually, no.

00:32:31,458 --> 00:32:33,526
Hell of a backlog,
here, Doc.

00:32:33,593 --> 00:32:36,863
Yeah. Traffic
pile-up on I-15.

00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:38,531
Holly Pearson?

00:32:38,598 --> 00:32:39,599
Mm.

00:32:43,269 --> 00:32:46,272
C.O.D.'s a one shot to
the back of the head.

00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:48,875
Absence of gun
powder and stippling

00:32:48,942 --> 00:32:50,810
suggests a non-contact wound.

00:32:50,877 --> 00:32:52,378
Dug this out.

00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:57,851
.25 caliber.

00:32:57,917 --> 00:32:59,619
It's the same
as the first victim.

00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:02,355
You know, I got something
you might find interesting.

00:33:02,422 --> 00:33:05,358
I emptied the stomach
and she hadn't eaten for hours.

00:33:05,425 --> 00:33:08,828
A small amount
of white zinfandel--

00:33:08,895 --> 00:33:11,097
Less than a glass,
vintage undetermined,

00:33:11,164 --> 00:33:12,499
and a tiny
scrap of meat.

00:33:12,565 --> 00:33:13,700
Take a look.

00:33:17,904 --> 00:33:19,139
Surface tissue

00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:20,140
of a human tongue.

00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:21,508
Those are the taste buds.

00:33:21,574 --> 00:33:23,510
She bit her attacker...

00:33:23,576 --> 00:33:25,979
when he tried to kiss her.

00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:29,849
This woman did not go gently
into that good night.

00:33:43,596 --> 00:33:45,532
Heard you may be looking
at a second victim?

00:33:45,598 --> 00:33:46,866
Yeah.

00:33:46,933 --> 00:33:50,336
Bullets from both homicides
are from the same gun.

00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:52,872
I just got off the phone
with Courthouse Security.

00:33:52,939 --> 00:33:54,874
That keycard that you
and Catherine found

00:33:54,941 --> 00:33:57,143
belongs a guy
named Adam Novak.

00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:59,479
Only prints I found
on the card were his.

00:33:59,546 --> 00:34:01,781
Well, let's call PD
and bring him in.

00:34:36,082 --> 00:34:37,751
Mom, Lindsey,

00:34:37,817 --> 00:34:38,985
go inside the house.

00:34:39,052 --> 00:34:40,019
Believe it or not,

00:34:40,086 --> 00:34:42,222
Catherine does know
how to say, "Hello,

00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:44,691
how are you? Would you
like a cup of coffee?"

00:34:44,758 --> 00:34:47,193
I was talking to your mother
about the case we're working.

00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,595
Mom, we're fine.

00:34:48,661 --> 00:34:49,929
Take Lindsey inside.

00:34:53,767 --> 00:34:55,268
Let's go.

00:34:55,335 --> 00:34:57,036
I don't,
I don't want to.

00:34:57,103 --> 00:34:58,238
Lindsey.

00:34:58,304 --> 00:35:00,240
Are you going to go out again?

00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:01,241
No. I'm coming in.

00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:02,675
I want to hear about your day.

00:35:04,878 --> 00:35:06,713
It was a pleasure
meeting you.

00:35:10,383 --> 00:35:11,484
What the hell
are you doing here?

00:35:11,551 --> 00:35:13,353
I want to know
why you're setting me up,

00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:15,488
manipulating evidence
to make me look guilty.

00:35:15,555 --> 00:35:16,489
All because
I came on too strong?

00:35:16,556 --> 00:35:17,490
I want you out of here.

00:35:17,557 --> 00:35:18,958
I didn't get
my signals crossed.

00:35:19,025 --> 00:35:20,026
You changed the play,

00:35:20,093 --> 00:35:21,261
and you're screaming foul.

00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:22,662
That's some power trip, babe.

00:35:22,729 --> 00:35:24,164
Who's the
guilty one here?

00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:25,832
You want to talk to
me, call your lawyer.

00:35:25,899 --> 00:35:27,167
Set up an appointment
down at PD.

00:35:27,233 --> 00:35:28,435
You think I killed her?

00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:29,936
Back off.

00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:31,137
You going to shoot me?

00:35:31,204 --> 00:35:32,806
If you take one more step.

00:35:32,872 --> 00:35:35,508
( <i>siren wailing</i> )

00:35:35,575 --> 00:35:36,943
You bitch.

00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:39,579
You came to my house.

00:35:43,834 --> 00:35:45,670
GRISSOM:
Mr. Novak, would you stick
out your tongue, please?

00:35:45,736 --> 00:35:46,971
What is this about?

00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:49,085
Well, right now, it's
about his tongue.

00:35:49,583 --> 00:35:50,851
And two
dead women.

00:35:50,918 --> 00:35:53,254
We believe the
second victim,
Holly Pearson,

00:35:53,321 --> 00:35:54,822
bit her
attacker's tongue.

00:35:54,889 --> 00:35:56,123
Open up, please.

00:36:02,363 --> 00:36:04,498
Uh-uh. Once more.

00:36:09,904 --> 00:36:11,706
Thank you.
That's all I need.

00:36:13,474 --> 00:36:14,909
Have a seat.

00:36:22,283 --> 00:36:24,875
You comfortable?
We're going to be a while.

00:36:24,875 --> 00:36:26,410
I know how this looks.

00:36:26,477 --> 00:36:27,611
Adam, I...

00:36:27,678 --> 00:36:29,246
I advise some
of the stupidest guys

00:36:29,313 --> 00:36:30,581
that come through this room.

00:36:30,648 --> 00:36:32,750
And it's my job is
to keep their mouths shut.

00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:34,718
And I know
what you're thinking--

00:36:34,785 --> 00:36:36,353
that I killed Alice Granger.

00:36:37,354 --> 00:36:39,089
( <i>whimpers</i> )

00:36:40,858 --> 00:36:41,892
( <i>gunshot</i> )

00:36:44,528 --> 00:36:47,097
You're a mind reader.

00:36:47,164 --> 00:36:48,332
I already admitted
that I picked her up

00:36:48,399 --> 00:36:49,733
at a bar
the other night.

00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,203
What I didn't mention,
and you didn't ask

00:36:52,269 --> 00:36:54,238
was that I gave her a ride home.

00:36:54,305 --> 00:36:58,275
<i>It got hot and heavy.</i>

00:36:58,342 --> 00:37:00,578
<i>We both got what we needed.</i>

00:37:00,644 --> 00:37:04,515
Then she said good night
and got out of the car.

00:37:04,582 --> 00:37:05,549
I drove off.

00:37:05,616 --> 00:37:07,017
Uh,

00:37:07,084 --> 00:37:08,319
Do you have any
evidence at all

00:37:08,385 --> 00:37:10,788
that refutes my client's
account, or suggests otherwise?

00:37:10,855 --> 00:37:12,957
Our evidence pertains
to the second victim,

00:37:13,023 --> 00:37:14,792
killed last night
with the same gun,

00:37:14,859 --> 00:37:16,193
and we believe that a portion

00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:18,429
of your client's tongue
was in her stomach.

00:37:18,496 --> 00:37:19,697
I can explain that.

00:37:19,763 --> 00:37:20,865
Oh? Really.

00:37:20,931 --> 00:37:22,867
Her taxi never showed up.

00:37:22,933 --> 00:37:26,937
<i>I was drunk. Out of line.</i>

00:37:27,004 --> 00:37:29,640
<i>Bad couple of days,</i>
<i>thanks to you guys.</i>

00:37:29,707 --> 00:37:31,642
<i>I was looking</i>
<i>for a little release</i>

00:37:31,709 --> 00:37:33,777
<i>and I chose the wrong girl.</i>

00:37:33,844 --> 00:37:35,312
And what happened next?

00:37:35,379 --> 00:37:36,881
Her taxi finally showed up.

00:37:36,947 --> 00:37:39,283
I spoke to both
the bartender at The Highball

00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:40,584
and the cab company,

00:37:40,651 --> 00:37:42,286
and a cab was ordered
and drove the victim home.

00:37:42,353 --> 00:37:48,025
Mr. Novak, have you ever
been to Holly Pearson's house?

00:37:48,092 --> 00:37:51,662
No. I have no idea
where she lived.

00:37:51,729 --> 00:37:53,430
Then how do you explain
your courthouse keycard

00:37:53,497 --> 00:37:54,632
which we found
near her body?

00:37:54,698 --> 00:37:59,036
CSI matched the prints
on the card. Only yours.

00:37:59,103 --> 00:38:01,572
Every attorney in the Public
Defenders Office

00:38:01,639 --> 00:38:02,907
is issued one card.

00:38:02,973 --> 00:38:05,176
Mine has never left my car.

00:38:05,242 --> 00:38:06,477
I keep it in
the center console.

00:38:06,544 --> 00:38:07,711
You don't need a warrant.

00:38:07,778 --> 00:38:09,079
You have my permission
to check.

00:38:09,146 --> 00:38:10,114
It should be there.

00:38:10,181 --> 00:38:11,815
Well, that won't
be hard to verify,

00:38:11,882 --> 00:38:13,517
because your car's
already at CSI.

00:38:19,623 --> 00:38:20,891
Nick.

00:38:20,958 --> 00:38:21,892
Hey.

00:38:21,959 --> 00:38:23,227
The center console.

00:38:23,294 --> 00:38:25,262
Was there a parking
lot car key inside?

00:38:25,329 --> 00:38:27,750
No. Two sticks of gum
and a pack of condoms.

00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:29,219
Why?

00:38:29,285 --> 00:38:32,375
Suspect claims some
incriminating evidence

00:38:32,375 --> 00:38:35,445
found at the second
crime scene wasn't his.

00:38:35,511 --> 00:38:37,513
It looks like he was lying.

00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:38,781
We got him.

00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:40,516
I don't know how you're
going to take this,

00:38:40,583 --> 00:38:44,787
but I think this car
was recently broken into.

00:38:44,854 --> 00:38:46,189
These scratches...

00:38:46,255 --> 00:38:47,792
they look fresh.

00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:49,093
B&amp;E 101.

00:38:50,962 --> 00:38:52,730
The Slim Jim.

00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:02,273
Somebody could've
swiped his keycard.

00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,976
And then locked
the car back up.

00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:06,410
Novak wouldn't
be the wiser

00:39:06,477 --> 00:39:08,646
until he drove into
the courthouse again.

00:39:08,713 --> 00:39:10,114
Did you find any prints?

00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:13,017
Smudges and partials,
inside and out.

00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:16,687
Run 'em.

00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:31,035
( <i>soft electronic chirping</i> )

00:39:31,102 --> 00:39:32,904
( <i>beep</i> )

00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:40,745
( <i>metal grinding</i> )

00:39:40,812 --> 00:39:43,014
Let's run through
the night Alice died again.

00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,348
We've been through this.

00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:45,516
I have an alibi.

00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:47,718
Your alibi only proves
you lost track of her.

00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:49,620
You knew where
Alice lived.

00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:51,622
Have you been
in Adam Novak's car recently?

00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:55,226
No. I don't even
know an Adam Novak.

00:39:55,293 --> 00:39:56,360
But you identified
his vehicle

00:39:56,427 --> 00:39:58,162
as the car that Alice
left the bar in.

00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:59,664
I didn't know whose car it was.

00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:00,998
Then why did we find
your prints in it?

00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:06,237
Maybe somebody's
trying to frame me.

00:40:06,304 --> 00:40:08,673
No, but I think that you're
familiar with the concept.

00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:13,344
You were obsessed with Alice,

00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:18,015
and when you saw Adam
having at her, you flipped out.

00:40:23,187 --> 00:40:26,257
I mean, here's a woman that you
can't get any traction with,

00:40:26,324 --> 00:40:28,259
yet she's willing
to do a stranger

00:40:28,326 --> 00:40:30,728
she picked up in a bar.

00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,086
I mean, lucky for you,

00:40:55,153 --> 00:40:58,022
The Highball
was Adam's second home.

00:40:58,089 --> 00:41:00,224
<i>The next night, you came back</i>

00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:04,729
<i>and saw his car</i>
<i>in the parking lot.</i>

00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:06,898
<i>Creative justice.</i>
<i>You could get them both.</i>

00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:13,905
<i>It was just bad luck that Holly</i>
Pearson met Adam that night.

00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:17,875
<i>You had no reason to kill her,</i>
<i>but you followed her home</i>

00:41:17,942 --> 00:41:21,245
<i>and worked up the nerve.</i>

00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:45,303
You made one mistake, though.

00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:48,673
The evidence that you used
to frame him

00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:50,741
brought us back to you.

00:41:58,417 --> 00:42:00,485
You figured out the source
of the contamination?

00:42:00,552 --> 00:42:04,923
I got a positive result
off my negative control.

00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:05,924
Matched the contamination.

00:42:05,991 --> 00:42:07,292
Turns out

00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:10,262
somebody at the manufacturer
forgot to put on their mask

00:42:10,329 --> 00:42:11,763
and then sneezed or coughed

00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:14,333
on what was supposed
to be a sterile product.

00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:16,001
You have to collect
everyone's swabs.

00:42:16,068 --> 00:42:18,403
Kits. Trucks. Vests.

00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:19,738
Work stations.

00:42:19,805 --> 00:42:21,773
How long till the new
shipment gets here?

00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,776
It's on its way.
Until then, do it old school.

00:42:28,914 --> 00:42:30,616
Gil.

00:42:33,652 --> 00:42:35,254
I'd ask you out
for a drink,

00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,955
but under
the circumstances,

00:42:37,022 --> 00:42:39,157
it's, uh...

00:42:41,393 --> 00:42:43,929
Okay, how long is
this going to go on?

00:42:43,996 --> 00:42:46,231
I don't know, Catherine.

00:42:47,166 --> 00:42:49,301
Gil, it was an act
of omission.

00:42:49,368 --> 00:42:53,639
How many times have we heard
a public defender say that?

00:42:54,406 --> 00:42:56,808
I went out after work.

00:42:56,875 --> 00:42:59,912
Is it a crime to want
a little human contact?

00:42:59,978 --> 00:43:01,713
I guess that's
why I don't go out.
