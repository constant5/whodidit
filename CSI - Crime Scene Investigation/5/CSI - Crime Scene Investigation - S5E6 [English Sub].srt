00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:20,166
Say it loud
and say it proud!

00:00:20,166 --> 00:00:21,301
Omega Zeta Pi!

00:00:23,136 --> 00:00:24,237
Say it loud
and say it proud!

00:00:24,304 --> 00:00:26,039
Omega Zeta Pi!

00:00:29,509 --> 00:00:32,278
( <i>sucking sounds</i> )

00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:33,875
Dude...

00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:34,569
( <i>spitting</i> )

00:00:34,636 --> 00:00:36,604
what's crawling on my face?

00:00:36,671 --> 00:00:39,240
WOMAN:
<i>It's Fraternity Hell Week.</i>

00:00:39,307 --> 00:00:42,577
<i>A pledge slipped and fell</i>
<i>in this pile of maggots.</i>

00:00:42,644 --> 00:00:45,947
School of Agriculture is in
charge of campus landscaping,

00:00:46,014 --> 00:00:48,316
so Security called me.

00:00:48,383 --> 00:00:50,452
You were the first person
I thought of.

00:00:50,518 --> 00:00:52,554
Well, thank you, Eva.
I'm honored.

00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,556
You make
your own mulch?

00:00:54,622 --> 00:00:56,891
The university
is self-sustaining.

00:00:56,958 --> 00:00:58,393
A city within a city.

00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,829
State institutions
are encouraged

00:01:00,895 --> 00:01:01,963
to practice Xeriscaping.

00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,398
"Xeri" meaning dry?

00:01:03,465 --> 00:01:04,733
Landscaping using

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,368
drought-tolerant plant life.

00:01:06,434 --> 00:01:07,635
Conserves water.

00:01:07,702 --> 00:01:10,572
There's no reason
for these maggots
to be here.

00:01:10,638 --> 00:01:13,441
Dr. Grissom, your tea.
Hold the tea bag?

00:01:13,508 --> 00:01:15,610
Thank you, Brian.

00:01:20,181 --> 00:01:21,783
Do, uh...

00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:24,119
do you use scraps

00:01:24,185 --> 00:01:25,587
from the dining halls
for your compost?

00:01:25,653 --> 00:01:26,955
No. Why?

00:01:27,022 --> 00:01:28,890
Well,

00:01:28,957 --> 00:01:31,659
if the devil requires
a pound of flesh,

00:01:31,726 --> 00:01:35,697
this many maggots would
require over a hundred.

00:01:35,764 --> 00:01:37,065
Pounds of flesh?

00:01:54,015 --> 00:01:57,419
Were you aware
that the average college student

00:01:57,485 --> 00:01:58,887
weighs 135 pounds?

MAN:
How long is this going to take?

00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,875
If something happened
to one of our students,
don't you want to know?

00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:42,959
Sure.

00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:44,793
But on a campus
this size,

00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,462
there's a thin line
between satisfying
curiosity

00:02:47,529 --> 00:02:49,498
and creating panic.

00:02:49,564 --> 00:02:51,633
This stopped being
about my curiosity

00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,669
the minute we found
a human tooth.

00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:58,807
We're now investigating
a possible homicide.

00:03:01,576 --> 00:03:04,875
Hey, Grissom, why is it hot?

00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:07,844
Maggot digestion can generate
heat up to 125 degrees.

00:03:07,911 --> 00:03:10,480
Heat increases the rate
of putrefaction,

00:03:10,547 --> 00:03:13,083
which speeds up
the digestive process.

00:03:14,284 --> 00:03:15,419
I don't see any tissue.

00:03:15,485 --> 00:03:18,188
How long would it take for them
to pick a body clean?

00:03:18,255 --> 00:03:20,057
Assuming it's just one body?

00:03:20,123 --> 00:03:21,191
A few days.

00:03:21,258 --> 00:03:22,559
Yeah, and that's another thing.

00:03:22,626 --> 00:03:24,995
I have a hard time believing
that if a corpse was here,

00:03:25,062 --> 00:03:26,096
no one saw it.

00:03:26,163 --> 00:03:27,397
And these bones?

00:03:27,464 --> 00:03:30,467
They're uniform.

00:03:30,534 --> 00:03:32,669
Same shape and size.

00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:35,172
Yeah.

00:03:37,341 --> 00:03:38,675
Same size

00:03:38,742 --> 00:03:39,810
as these wood chips.

00:03:40,877 --> 00:03:43,914
( <i>loud whooshing</i> )

00:04:05,068 --> 00:04:06,937
This thing always this loud?

00:04:07,004 --> 00:04:09,940
Yeah, but we're, we're kind of
off the beaten path.

00:04:10,007 --> 00:04:11,341
You use it every day?

00:04:11,408 --> 00:04:13,310
Pretty much.

00:04:17,014 --> 00:04:19,950
You think a human body
could fit through there?

00:04:20,017 --> 00:04:21,218
You planning something?

00:04:21,284 --> 00:04:23,687
Gil Grissom,
Las Vegas Crime Lab.

00:04:23,754 --> 00:04:25,455
Walter Beerly,
Master of the Universe.

00:04:25,522 --> 00:04:27,124
Six cylinders.

00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:29,159
200 horse power.

00:04:29,226 --> 00:04:32,095
Thing's got an engine
that would give most SUVs

00:04:32,162 --> 00:04:33,530
a run for their money.

00:04:33,597 --> 00:04:34,898
And it's got one job.

00:04:34,965 --> 00:04:36,967
Chopping crap up.

00:04:37,034 --> 00:04:38,235
So the answer's yes.

00:04:42,372 --> 00:04:44,207
Would take about 15 seconds.

00:04:44,274 --> 00:04:45,642
May I?

00:04:45,709 --> 00:04:47,778
You want to stick your head
in there, be my guest.

00:04:51,381 --> 00:04:52,115
What are you looking for?

00:04:52,182 --> 00:04:54,117
Blood.

00:04:54,184 --> 00:04:55,752
Oh, you're pretty much
out of luck,

00:04:55,819 --> 00:04:57,654
'cause I've been chipping
all morning,

00:04:57,721 --> 00:05:02,192
and if there was any in there,
it's probably gone.

00:05:02,259 --> 00:05:05,128
See, wood absorbs moisture.

00:05:05,195 --> 00:05:08,932
One of the reasons
they use it for mulch.

00:05:17,474 --> 00:05:18,608
Pregnant?

00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,311
It's human.

00:05:34,424 --> 00:05:36,460
Remember, you're
on the clock, man.

00:05:36,526 --> 00:05:42,265
About, uh, 24 hours...
all of these maggots
turn into flies.

00:06:05,188 --> 00:06:07,190
What are you doing?

00:06:07,257 --> 00:06:10,294
GRISSOM:
Day shift told me
you didn't get any results

00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,328
off the tooth.

00:06:11,395 --> 00:06:14,064
MIA:
Yeah, it was
a porcelain crown.

00:06:14,131 --> 00:06:16,166
Root canal.
No viable pulp.

00:06:16,233 --> 00:06:18,802
I still need a DNA profile
on our victim.

00:06:18,869 --> 00:06:21,838
And since bone marrow extraction
can be difficult...

00:06:21,905 --> 00:06:24,908
GRISSOM:
I figured I'd go straight
to the source.

00:06:24,975 --> 00:06:27,744
Well, maggots are
eating machines.

00:06:27,811 --> 00:06:30,847
They'll have DNA from the flesh.

00:06:30,914 --> 00:06:32,015
It's genius.

00:06:32,082 --> 00:06:33,717
There you go.

00:06:33,784 --> 00:06:36,320
One maggot colada,
coming up.

00:06:46,363 --> 00:06:48,332
WILLOWS:
What's with the tape?

00:06:48,398 --> 00:06:50,267
The evidence
wasn't cooperating,

00:06:50,334 --> 00:06:51,735
so I stuck it to them.

00:06:52,936 --> 00:06:53,937
Cute.

00:06:55,906 --> 00:06:57,207
Anything of interest?

00:06:57,274 --> 00:06:59,276
Well, I haven't had much time
for analysis.

00:06:59,343 --> 00:07:00,978
So far the only
inorganics

00:07:01,044 --> 00:07:03,013
are these black
plastic shreds,

00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,881
from a garbage
bag, I think,

00:07:04,948 --> 00:07:06,083
and...

00:07:06,149 --> 00:07:07,117
this.

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,062
Well, blue trace
is tacky.

00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:25,068
It's a fingernail.

00:07:26,103 --> 00:07:27,337
Uh, sorry, Sara.

00:07:27,404 --> 00:07:28,672
I need the microscope.
Priority.

00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:30,007
I got three more
samples to run.

00:07:30,073 --> 00:07:31,441
When I'm done,
it'll be your turn.

00:07:31,508 --> 00:07:32,442
This can't wait.

00:07:32,509 --> 00:07:33,977
It can't?

00:07:34,044 --> 00:07:35,312
Or you can't?

00:07:35,379 --> 00:07:36,446
Both.

00:07:36,513 --> 00:07:38,382
Go have a cup of coffee on me.

00:07:42,386 --> 00:07:43,487
The coffee's free.

00:07:43,553 --> 00:07:45,055
Thank you.

00:08:21,892 --> 00:08:25,362
Oil-based blue paint
mixed with motor oil...

00:08:25,429 --> 00:08:26,863
on a fingernail.

00:08:28,765 --> 00:08:31,034
He's back.

00:08:31,101 --> 00:08:33,737
Starting in 1987,
a series of murders

00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,539
occurred on the WLVU campus.

00:08:35,605 --> 00:08:36,540
Three women:

00:08:36,606 --> 00:08:38,175
Janet Kent...

00:08:38,241 --> 00:08:40,043
Marcia Reese...

00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,979
and Charlene Roth.

00:08:42,045 --> 00:08:44,781
Now, Charlene Roth's murder
provided us with enough evidence

00:08:44,848 --> 00:08:47,985
to investigate a suspect...

00:08:48,051 --> 00:08:51,788
John Mathers,
WLVU security guard.

00:08:51,855 --> 00:08:54,191
He was arrested, tried
and convicted.

00:08:54,257 --> 00:08:55,325
Two years ago,

00:08:55,392 --> 00:08:57,294
<i>this week, he was executed.</i>

00:08:57,361 --> 00:09:00,163
The night of his execution,
Debby Reston was murdered.

00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:01,198
Copycat, right?

00:09:01,264 --> 00:09:02,332
WILLOWS:
No.

00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,635
We believe that Mathers
was the copycat,

00:09:04,701 --> 00:09:07,137
responsible only
for Charlene Roth's death.

00:09:07,204 --> 00:09:09,740
Which means the serial killer
is still at large.

00:09:09,806 --> 00:09:11,975
And we have reason to believe
that he has killed again.

00:09:12,042 --> 00:09:14,478
Our suspect's M.O.

00:09:14,544 --> 00:09:17,247
<i>is to apply blue paint</i>
<i>to a campus railing</i>

00:09:17,314 --> 00:09:18,582
<i>that he has infused</i>

00:09:18,649 --> 00:09:20,651
<i>with motor oil to retard</i>

00:09:20,717 --> 00:09:21,718
<i>the drying process.</i>

00:09:21,785 --> 00:09:23,754
He then lays in wait
for a female victim

00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,323
to touch the railing.

00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:28,825
<i>It's always near</i>
<i>a water fountain.</i>

00:09:28,892 --> 00:09:30,727
<i>He then grabs them from behind</i>

00:09:30,794 --> 00:09:33,397
as they're washing the paint
from their hands.

00:09:33,463 --> 00:09:36,933
Our suspect's prior victims
were all sexually assaulted.

00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,135
No semen was found.

00:09:38,201 --> 00:09:40,404
Cause of death: strangulation.

00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:43,173
He stuffed them
in black plastic trash bags

00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,641
<i>and dumps the bodies</i>

00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:46,209
<i>in plain sight.</i>

00:09:46,276 --> 00:09:49,413
Given that he has been killing
for around 20 years,

00:09:49,479 --> 00:09:51,248
we approximate his age to be

00:09:51,315 --> 00:09:53,116
<i>at least 35.</i>

00:09:53,183 --> 00:09:54,251
<i>He may wear glasses.</i>

00:09:54,318 --> 00:09:56,453
<i>He may drive a Chevy</i>
<i>with black interior.</i>

00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,989
The latest victim was put
in a wood chipper.

00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:00,390
Why the change in M.O.?

00:10:00,457 --> 00:10:01,758
Serials have been known

00:10:01,825 --> 00:10:04,561
to change their signatures
because they have to.

00:10:04,628 --> 00:10:06,630
Fear of being caught...

00:10:06,697 --> 00:10:10,367
interruption... or it could
just be an act of escalation.

00:10:10,434 --> 00:10:11,735
BRASS:
<i>So we're looking</i>
<i>for a sadistic,</i>

00:10:11,802 --> 00:10:14,972
<i>ritualistic,</i>
<i>organized sociopath.</i>

00:10:15,038 --> 00:10:16,406
<i>We'll be on 12 and 12s.</i>

00:10:16,473 --> 00:10:19,343
<i>No holidays, no vacations</i>
<i>until this is solved.</i>

00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:24,417
Ms. Willows,
can you confirm

00:10:24,417 --> 00:10:26,519
that the Blue Paint
Killer has claimed
another victim?

00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:28,534
I haven't been cleared
for comment.

00:10:28,601 --> 00:10:31,917
Ms. Willows,
was John Mathers
wrongfully convicted?

00:10:31,917 --> 00:10:34,486
<i>Did the State execute</i>
<i>an innocent man?</i>

00:10:34,553 --> 00:10:39,208
John Mathers killed Charlene
Roth and was punished for it.

00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:41,458
Well, how can you
be so sure of that?

00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:43,026
I double-checked the results.

00:10:43,092 --> 00:10:44,861
The DNA from
the maggots is male.

00:10:44,928 --> 00:10:46,930
Any possible
cross-contamination?

00:10:46,996 --> 00:10:49,299
No, the samples
were pure.

00:10:49,365 --> 00:10:51,034
Griss, this place
is crawling with press.

00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,135
They want a statement.

00:10:52,202 --> 00:10:53,870
Not now.
Well, if you don't
say anything,

00:10:53,937 --> 00:10:55,705
they're just going
to fill in the blanks...

00:10:55,772 --> 00:10:57,707
Screw the press,
'cause for all I know,

00:10:57,774 --> 00:10:59,509
the dead body is
an auto mechanic

00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:01,678
who just painted
his house blue.

00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:22,031
WILLOWS:
What's this key used for?

00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,366
Um, pledging.
Plebes are asked

00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,468
to swallow it on the first night
of Hell Week.

00:11:25,535 --> 00:11:27,804
Then "retrieve" it
and return it by the end
of the week, right?

00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,938
You got it.

00:11:29,005 --> 00:11:30,340
You know that hazing is illegal.

00:11:30,406 --> 00:11:31,608
You could lose your charter.

00:11:31,674 --> 00:11:35,445
Well, it's not hazing.
It's a voluntary loyalty ritual.

00:11:35,512 --> 00:11:37,147
Political science major?

00:11:37,213 --> 00:11:38,481
Pre-law.
!
Good.

00:11:38,548 --> 00:11:39,816
Maybe you can explain why

00:11:39,883 --> 00:11:42,352
the pledge who swallowed
this key ended up dead.

00:11:42,418 --> 00:11:45,221
Wha-What're you talking about?

00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:47,223
Has anyone from
Omega Zeta Pi

00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,325
dropped out or gone missing?

00:11:55,431 --> 00:11:57,100
Uh...

00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:03,006
Yeah, Jo-Jonathan Avery
Haywood III.

00:12:03,072 --> 00:12:06,075
Johnny.
Oh, kid was a shoe-in.

00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,877
Dad was a member.
Granddad was
a member.

00:12:07,944 --> 00:12:10,847
But we haven't seen
Johnny since Pledge Week.

00:12:10,914 --> 00:12:12,415
So, he's been missing for days,

00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:14,250
yet you didn't bother
to call anyone?

00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:16,152
For all I knew
he was getting laid.

00:12:16,219 --> 00:12:19,022
Look, I'm the fraternity
president, not his mother.

00:12:19,088 --> 00:12:21,658
We're gonna need his toothbrush
and his hairbrush.

00:12:21,724 --> 00:12:23,593
Get off of me!
Button!

00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,728
I'm a loser.
I'm a loser. I'm a loser.

00:12:32,902 --> 00:12:35,572
Why didn't Nick
find this before?

00:12:35,638 --> 00:12:37,941
'Cause he was
working from
a schematic

00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,742
the campus
security
gave him.

00:12:39,809 --> 00:12:41,911
The railing's
not on it.

00:12:52,055 --> 00:12:54,290
This cement is fresh.

00:12:57,961 --> 00:13:01,397
So, now he's not just painting
railings; he's installing them.

00:13:01,464 --> 00:13:03,299
We're going to need
to dig this up,

00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:05,001
cement and all.

00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:22,819
Get Brass. We have
another body.

00:13:47,977 --> 00:13:51,147
So, he knew we would find this.

00:13:52,682 --> 00:13:55,185
And now he's taunting us.

00:15:17,801 --> 00:15:20,236
Two years ago,
DNA confirmed

00:15:20,303 --> 00:15:22,172
a hair found
on Debby Reston

00:15:22,238 --> 00:15:25,909
belonged to the serial's first
victim, Janet Kent.

00:15:27,977 --> 00:15:29,479
Planted hairs.

00:15:29,546 --> 00:15:32,649
It's part of his signature.

00:16:03,012 --> 00:16:05,815
WILLOWS:
Well, DNA confirmed
that the hair found

00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:08,585
in the doll's mouth
belonged to Debby Reston.

00:16:08,651 --> 00:16:10,286
I tested the
note with ESDA,

00:16:10,353 --> 00:16:13,056
because I saw
some indentations
in the paper.

00:16:13,123 --> 00:16:17,026
He must've written "I have her"
on the underlying page.

00:16:17,093 --> 00:16:18,261
Prior evidence
indicated

00:16:18,328 --> 00:16:21,397
that the suspect was an artist
or had some connection

00:16:21,464 --> 00:16:23,500
to the university's
Art Department.

00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:26,302
Serials typically photograph
their crime scenes.

00:16:26,369 --> 00:16:27,971
If we're dealing with
an artist here...

00:16:28,037 --> 00:16:30,573
maybe he <i>drew</i>
his victims instead.

00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,308
BROWN:
Looks like she's
in a small room.

00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,077
What is that in the foreground?

00:16:34,144 --> 00:16:36,513
Chair? Sofa?

00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:38,448
What about behind her?

00:16:38,515 --> 00:16:39,949
STOKES:
Windows, maybe.

00:16:40,016 --> 00:16:41,384
Can we blow that up?

00:16:45,488 --> 00:16:47,357
Some kind of signage?

00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:50,426
And the lettering's backwards.

00:16:50,493 --> 00:16:52,495
STOKES:
Cramped space.

00:16:52,562 --> 00:16:54,831
Chairs in the foreground,
but no other furniture.

00:16:54,898 --> 00:16:56,800
No shutters or curtains
on the windows.

00:16:59,035 --> 00:17:02,305
Maybe it's not a room.
Maybe it's a... vehicle.

00:17:02,372 --> 00:17:04,674
He was in
the front seat,

00:17:04,741 --> 00:17:06,910
and he was looking at her
through the rearview mirror.

00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:15,552
So, he can attack her,
abduct her,

00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:18,221
rape her and strangle her,

00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:21,491
but he can't look
directly at her?

00:17:21,558 --> 00:17:23,326
Guys, those black
trilobal fibers

00:17:23,393 --> 00:17:25,395
that we found
on Debby Reston's body

00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:27,163
were from a Chevy.

00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:30,700
And the size and shape
of those windows

00:17:30,767 --> 00:17:34,537
are consistent
with a Chevy van.

00:17:42,278 --> 00:17:44,247
I recognize the signage.

00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:47,183
The Erotica Boutique
on Tropicana.

00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,490
It's distinctive...

00:17:53,556 --> 00:17:55,191
The font...

00:18:10,773 --> 00:18:12,208
BRASS:
Okay, break it open.

00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:23,753
( <i>catches his breath</i> )

00:18:31,261 --> 00:18:33,830
So, this is
where he brought them.

00:18:38,434 --> 00:18:41,237
The pump was probably
for the doll.

00:18:41,304 --> 00:18:43,439
Beer bottles...

00:18:43,506 --> 00:18:46,075
Tell Mia to check them
for saliva,

00:18:46,142 --> 00:18:48,611
as well as other bodily fluids.

00:18:48,678 --> 00:18:52,582
You're thinking she was raped
with a foreign object...

00:18:52,649 --> 00:18:54,984
may be why we never found semen.

00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:56,553
The police presence
on the campus

00:18:56,619 --> 00:18:58,822
probably interrupted
his plans for her disposal.

00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:00,290
I'll take the girl.

00:19:00,356 --> 00:19:01,691
I'll take the van.

00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:30,120
Huh.

00:19:30,186 --> 00:19:32,689
I would've picked you
for a leather guy.

00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:36,092
Has anyone, uh, bought

00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:40,130
one of these Coed Cheerleader
Dolls in the last few days?

00:19:40,196 --> 00:19:41,931
Most popular models are
the latex

00:19:41,998 --> 00:19:44,834
love-'em-or-leave-'em cheapies
for bachelor parties.

00:19:44,901 --> 00:19:47,770
But in the midrange,
Chrissy's not a bad choice.

00:19:47,837 --> 00:19:52,509
Well, I'm more interested in the
clientele than the merchandise.

00:19:52,575 --> 00:19:53,977
Oh.

00:19:54,043 --> 00:19:56,846
I'd like to take a look
at your credit card receipts.

00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:03,019
Surveillance?

00:20:03,086 --> 00:20:04,854
Bad for business.

00:20:21,504 --> 00:20:23,506
You know this artist?

00:20:23,573 --> 00:20:26,009
Yeah, that is "Zippy Tee."

00:20:26,075 --> 00:20:27,343
You have an address for him?

00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:28,411
Dude, I don't know
where he lives.

00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:29,646
How do you pay him?

00:20:29,712 --> 00:20:31,214
It's not the Louvre.

00:20:31,281 --> 00:20:33,016
It's the Love Boutique.

00:20:33,082 --> 00:20:35,118
Local guys get
store credit.

00:20:35,185 --> 00:20:36,553
Has he ever traded

00:20:36,619 --> 00:20:38,655
for... a doll?

00:20:38,721 --> 00:20:40,557
Yeah.

00:20:40,623 --> 00:20:42,659
Can you describe him for me?

00:20:42,725 --> 00:20:44,761
White guy.
Brown hair.

00:20:44,828 --> 00:20:48,731
Little shorter than you.
40, maybe 45...

00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:50,967
Average looking.
Average looking.

00:20:54,471 --> 00:20:57,440
ROBBINS:
This all looks eerily familiar.

00:20:57,507 --> 00:20:59,442
Blue paint on the hand.

00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:02,245
Physical signs
of sexual assault.

00:21:02,312 --> 00:21:05,448
Ligature marks
around the neck.

00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:08,017
Prints turn up anything?

00:21:08,084 --> 00:21:09,119
She's still a Jane Doe.

00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:10,854
Height and weight?

00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,955
Five-eight.

00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:13,456
131 pounds.

00:21:13,523 --> 00:21:15,125
Can you take down
her hair?

00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:16,793
Sure.

00:21:21,731 --> 00:21:23,433
Pretty.

00:21:39,115 --> 00:21:41,017
Pretty boy.

00:21:42,452 --> 00:21:44,087
Definite similarity.

00:21:44,154 --> 00:21:45,655
None of the other victims
looked alike.

00:21:45,722 --> 00:21:47,056
So, why these two?

00:21:47,123 --> 00:21:48,825
Maybe he
was a mistake.

00:21:48,892 --> 00:21:50,760
Mistaken for a girl?

00:21:50,827 --> 00:21:54,164
WILLOWS:
<i>But not just any girl.</i>

00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,032
This <i>girl.</i>

00:21:59,969 --> 00:22:02,939
We thought he selected
his victims at random.

00:22:03,006 --> 00:22:04,607
He didn't.

00:22:04,674 --> 00:22:07,177
He chose her.

00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:08,878
He hunted her.

00:22:08,945 --> 00:22:10,680
And trapped her.

00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:13,226
The TV said
you were looking

00:22:13,292 --> 00:22:15,709
for information
on Kaitlin Rackish.

00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:18,078
WILLOWS:
When was the last time
you saw Kaitlin?

00:22:18,145 --> 00:22:21,548
Monday, but I've been pledging,

00:22:21,615 --> 00:22:25,686
so I haven't slept in the dorm
the last couple nights.

00:22:25,753 --> 00:22:30,124
I just thought
I kept missing her.

00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:32,926
Can you tell me what the two
of you did on Monday?

00:22:32,993 --> 00:22:33,994
All the details.

00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:40,634
We went to the gym. Showered.

00:22:40,701 --> 00:22:42,736
Went to the dining hall.

00:22:42,803 --> 00:22:44,805
Monday's mac-n-cheese day.

00:22:44,872 --> 00:22:46,440
It's Katy's favorite.

00:22:46,507 --> 00:22:47,641
We picked up our orders

00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:53,447
at the Campus Copy Union--
term papers.

00:22:53,514 --> 00:22:58,652
We bought sodas
at the bookstore.

00:22:58,719 --> 00:23:02,256
We went to the library to study.

00:23:02,323 --> 00:23:05,859
A couple guys from Zeta Beta
Theta were at the same table,

00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:10,798
so we didn't get that much done.

00:23:10,864 --> 00:23:13,534
Then she left for her
7:00 class.

00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,936
What class is that?

00:23:18,172 --> 00:23:20,874
Monday's, um...

00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:22,810
"Introduction
to the Female Form"

00:23:22,876 --> 00:23:24,411
with Professor Lewis.

00:23:24,478 --> 00:23:28,549
Cody Lewis?

00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:32,753
He got me interested in art.

00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,823
"Introduction
to the Female Form"?

00:23:35,889 --> 00:23:40,027
Well, that's deep.
That's really deep.

00:23:40,094 --> 00:23:43,230
I bet that brings in all
the 17-year-old pre-feminists.

00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:45,399
This isn't mine.

00:23:45,466 --> 00:23:47,034
Technique isn't bad,
but it's raw.

00:23:47,101 --> 00:23:49,536
This person hasn't had any
formal training at all.

00:23:49,603 --> 00:23:51,238
Well, maybe it's your alter ego.

00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:53,774
You know, your bad-boy side;
the Mr. Hyde thing.

00:23:53,841 --> 00:23:56,877
You know, I came in voluntarily.
You see, I want to help you.

00:23:56,944 --> 00:23:58,879
But this is borderlining
on harassment.

00:23:58,946 --> 00:24:00,381
Look, I'm trying to tie together
some loose ends,

00:24:00,447 --> 00:24:02,116
so help me out, all right?
I appreciate your help. I do.

00:24:02,182 --> 00:24:04,184
You got rid
of your Chevy van.

00:24:04,251 --> 00:24:05,185
You got yourself a wife.

00:24:05,252 --> 00:24:07,554
Does she know you dated
the first victim?

00:24:07,621 --> 00:24:09,857
Your return to the campus
coincided with the murder

00:24:09,923 --> 00:24:11,592
of the fourth victim?

00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:14,061
And Kaitlin Rackish
was in your evening classes?

00:24:14,128 --> 00:24:15,095
You see what I got?

00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:16,096
No, I don't.

00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:17,431
Your buddy Mathers

00:24:17,498 --> 00:24:19,566
didn't talk much, either,
and look what happened to him.

00:24:19,633 --> 00:24:21,068
He's at the wrong end
of a cold needle.

00:24:21,135 --> 00:24:22,903
You know what it's like
to be told

00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:26,073
you lead the life and fit
the profile of a serial killer?

00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,308
No. I wouldn't have a clue.

00:24:27,374 --> 00:24:28,309
You see, you make

00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:29,376
all these assumptions,

00:24:29,443 --> 00:24:31,712
and you're not asking
questions here.

00:24:31,779 --> 00:24:34,248
You're attacking me to see how
I react to what you say.

00:24:34,315 --> 00:24:36,750
Nothing I say is going to make
a difference with you.

00:24:36,817 --> 00:24:37,785
So what's the point?

00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:40,321
Why don't you just confess?

00:24:42,089 --> 00:24:44,658
That's my point.

00:24:44,725 --> 00:24:47,027
I didn't do it.

00:24:55,469 --> 00:24:57,838
SANDERS:
WLVU parking pass.

00:24:57,905 --> 00:25:01,976
Connection to the campus.
1986.

00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,677
This guy's been doing this
a long time.

00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:07,481
STOKES:
Two years ago, Debby Reston
broke her killer's glasses.

00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:10,584
They were 20/80.

00:25:10,651 --> 00:25:12,653
I'll run 'em.
See if they're the same.

00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:17,524
STOKES:
VIN's been obliterated.

00:25:17,591 --> 00:25:19,059
You better go ahead and
run that parking pass.

00:25:21,495 --> 00:25:23,364
SANDERS:
Plate's expired.

00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:25,332
Registration
sticker's a phoney.

00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:26,367
How do you know?

00:25:26,433 --> 00:25:29,003
STOKES:
Check out the serial number.

00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:34,208
"0-0-0-0..."
Yeah, got it. Homemade.

00:25:55,496 --> 00:25:56,997
SANDERS:
Hey, did you spill print powder

00:25:57,064 --> 00:25:58,866
in the back of the van?
No.

00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:00,567
No, I superglued. Why?

00:26:00,634 --> 00:26:03,637
May have found something.

00:26:03,704 --> 00:26:06,407
Anything from the prints
off the van?

00:26:06,473 --> 00:26:09,410
Prints from the dash
and the rearview mirror

00:26:09,476 --> 00:26:12,713
were a match to the partial
that we got off the trash bag

00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:15,049
Debby Reston was found in
two years ago.

00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:17,584
Same guy, but still
no hits from AFIS.

00:26:20,487 --> 00:26:22,423
SIDLE:
Are the X-rated
comic books ready?

00:26:22,489 --> 00:26:25,926
Nothing comical about them.
Look at this.

00:26:25,993 --> 00:26:30,364
Double-D cups,
tiny waists, bondage.

00:26:30,431 --> 00:26:31,865
Dehumanization.

00:26:31,932 --> 00:26:35,102
I'm all for visual stimulation,
but these images

00:26:35,169 --> 00:26:39,340
are about domination, not sex.

00:26:39,406 --> 00:26:43,344
This artist gets off
on dominating women.

00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:45,546
This is his sex.

00:26:48,849 --> 00:26:52,553
BROWN:
Janet and Marcia both lived
in Dakin Hall.

00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:55,022
Charlene and Debby
took Econ 101.

00:26:55,089 --> 00:26:59,059
Marcia and Charlene
took English Lit.

00:26:59,126 --> 00:27:04,131
Janet, Debby and Kaitlin all ate
at Macgraw Dining Hall.

00:27:04,198 --> 00:27:05,366
Janet dated Cody Lewis.

00:27:05,432 --> 00:27:08,035
Kaitlin took his art class.

00:27:08,102 --> 00:27:09,036
All right, so, uh,

00:27:09,103 --> 00:27:10,738
There's not one single thing

00:27:10,804 --> 00:27:12,873
that all five women
have in common.

00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,241
Right.

00:27:45,773 --> 00:27:48,008
( <i>woman groans</i> )

00:27:48,075 --> 00:27:49,877
( <i>muffled</i> ):
Please, help.

00:28:22,876 --> 00:28:25,613
STOKES:
<i>Dead plates.</i>

00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:28,515
Tampered VIN. Registration
stickers are counterfeit.

00:28:28,582 --> 00:28:29,984
Killer did a good job,
though.

00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:32,453
He used the right color,
changed them every year,

00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:33,621
but no serial numbers.

00:28:33,687 --> 00:28:35,856
So, we still don't
know who owns the van.

00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:38,425
Well, Greg did find this
in the glove box.

00:28:38,492 --> 00:28:39,560
It's from 1986.

00:28:39,627 --> 00:28:41,662
So I called
School Administration.

00:28:41,729 --> 00:28:43,263
It's parking spot 324.

00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:48,168
Not a student, but an employee
executed two years ago.

00:28:48,235 --> 00:28:49,270
John Mathers?

00:28:49,336 --> 00:28:51,438
Yep. Ran Mathers
through the DMV.

00:28:51,505 --> 00:28:54,742
The partial VIN number
on our van's a match.

00:28:54,808 --> 00:28:57,878
So, our killer was driving
around in Mathers' old van.

00:28:57,945 --> 00:29:01,882
I don't think these two guys
are an original and a copycat.

00:29:03,317 --> 00:29:05,286
They were partners.

00:29:09,709 --> 00:29:11,978
I don't deserve to die.

00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,035
You think killing me
will solve anything?

00:29:15,102 --> 00:29:20,307
I've prepared myself,
but I'm not ready.

00:29:20,374 --> 00:29:22,209
This the John Mathers
interview?

00:29:22,276 --> 00:29:23,911
Week before
he was executed.

00:29:23,978 --> 00:29:26,747
JOURNALIST:
Charlene Roth's mother
testified at the Allocution

00:29:26,814 --> 00:29:29,083
that your death would
mean her closure.

00:29:29,149 --> 00:29:30,951
Not if you kill the wrong man.

00:29:31,018 --> 00:29:32,987
JOURNALIST:
Forensic evidence
testified to at your trial

00:29:33,053 --> 00:29:34,021
says that you're guilty.

00:29:34,088 --> 00:29:35,689
Forensic evidence
changes all the time.

00:29:35,756 --> 00:29:37,558
One day I'm innocent,
the next day I'm not.

00:29:37,624 --> 00:29:39,727
Is there anything
in his prison file?

00:29:39,793 --> 00:29:42,296
All those years on death row
he only had one visitor,

00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:43,297
his lawyer.

00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:44,465
Although he
did receive

00:29:44,531 --> 00:29:46,967
a far amount of letters
from random women...

00:29:47,034 --> 00:29:49,470
if he was in communication
with his partner,

00:29:49,536 --> 00:29:51,171
nothing in the file shows it.

00:29:51,238 --> 00:29:53,440
You've been in
prison for 15 years.

00:29:53,507 --> 00:29:56,143
During that time
the murders stopped.

00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:59,947
What does that prove?

00:30:00,014 --> 00:30:01,181
The real killer's smart.

00:30:01,248 --> 00:30:04,952
Watches the news, he reads
the papers just like you.

00:30:05,019 --> 00:30:08,222
I'm... Man,
I'm the perfect patsy.

00:30:08,288 --> 00:30:09,456
So you maintain
your innocence?

00:30:09,523 --> 00:30:10,724
Absolutely.

00:30:10,791 --> 00:30:12,660
I worked Campus Security.

00:30:12,726 --> 00:30:14,862
I'm not the smartest
or the richest guy,

00:30:14,928 --> 00:30:17,431
but do I look like I had
problems with women?

00:30:19,767 --> 00:30:20,801
I'm not the killer.

00:30:23,904 --> 00:30:26,573
Remember that when I'm gone.

00:30:27,941 --> 00:30:29,977
SIDLE:
Well, the prints

00:30:30,044 --> 00:30:31,612
on the comb bindings
from the comic books

00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:33,380
are a match to the prints
recovered from the van

00:30:33,447 --> 00:30:34,848
and the garbage bag

00:30:34,915 --> 00:30:36,216
that Debby Reston was in.

00:30:36,283 --> 00:30:38,118
GRISSOM:
Did you analyze
the comics?

00:30:38,185 --> 00:30:40,454
Yeah, and the drawings
indicate a dominant,

00:30:40,521 --> 00:30:42,623
disassociative sexual sadist.

00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:45,426
Prison shrink diagnosed Mathers
as a psychopath

00:30:45,492 --> 00:30:47,728
with a dependent
personality disorder.

00:30:47,795 --> 00:30:49,730
Which means he was pre-disposed
to violent crimes

00:30:49,797 --> 00:30:51,565
but he might have needed
some encouragement.

00:30:51,632 --> 00:30:54,668
Well, to invite someone to join
you for torture and murder

00:30:54,735 --> 00:30:56,603
would require
a great deal of trust.

00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:57,738
You would only do it

00:30:57,805 --> 00:31:00,641
if you knew you could completely
control your partner.

00:31:00,708 --> 00:31:02,843
Mathers was the submissive.

00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:05,312
His partner is the alpha male.

00:31:05,379 --> 00:31:08,816
Sexual sadism can go hand in
hand with sexual dysfunction.

00:31:08,882 --> 00:31:10,584
Mathers said
that he wasn't the killer,

00:31:10,651 --> 00:31:12,953
but we confirmed that he had sex
with Charlene Roth,

00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:15,723
based on the fact that we found
his pubic hairs on her body.

00:31:15,789 --> 00:31:18,359
Mia was looking for saliva on
the beer bottles from the van

00:31:18,425 --> 00:31:21,061
and found a vaginal contribution
on the neck of one of them.

00:31:21,128 --> 00:31:24,231
Maybe Mathers was this guy's
surrogate penis.

00:31:24,298 --> 00:31:26,934
WILLOWS:
Okay, the partner

00:31:27,001 --> 00:31:30,838
kills on the eve
of Mathers' execution,

00:31:30,904 --> 00:31:32,606
and again this week,

00:31:32,673 --> 00:31:34,575
on the second anniversary.

00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:36,610
Why the no-show last year?

00:31:36,677 --> 00:31:38,512
Maybe life got in the way.

00:31:38,579 --> 00:31:41,181
Nick, that black powder from
the back of the van is ink.

00:31:41,248 --> 00:31:44,618
A toner made exclusively
for commercial copy machines.

00:31:44,685 --> 00:31:45,953
OCE 3600.

00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:47,554
Okay. Thanks, Hodges.

00:31:50,891 --> 00:31:53,193
The most recent victim

00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:55,763
went to the
Campus Copy Union

00:31:55,829 --> 00:31:58,198
with her roommate
on the day she disappeared.

00:31:58,265 --> 00:31:59,400
Janet Kent's...

00:32:03,637 --> 00:32:05,239
pocket contents--

00:32:05,305 --> 00:32:08,909
a receipt from WLVU Copy Union.

00:32:08,976 --> 00:32:12,346
On Debby Reston's backseat...

00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:16,116
catalogs with comb bindings.

00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,954
Who'd you find?

00:32:21,021 --> 00:32:23,057
Kevin Greer.
Works at the Copy Union.

00:32:23,123 --> 00:32:26,794
Only employee who's been there
over ten years; since 1983.

00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,329
BRASS:
Fits our profile.

00:32:28,395 --> 00:32:29,530
Where's Kevin Greer?

00:32:29,596 --> 00:32:30,964
He just left.
He works till 8:00.

00:32:31,031 --> 00:32:32,499
Time for evening classes
to let out.

00:32:32,566 --> 00:32:33,567
What's going on?

00:32:33,634 --> 00:32:35,302
Look, we'd like to talk
to Kevin Greer.

00:32:35,369 --> 00:32:36,603
You have any idea
where he is?

00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:37,638
No. We don't hang out.

00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:38,706
How many people work here?

00:32:38,772 --> 00:32:39,707
Just me.

00:32:39,773 --> 00:32:40,941
Okay,
we need to look around.

00:32:41,008 --> 00:32:42,876
Okay.

00:32:52,152 --> 00:32:54,355
Black plastic trash bags
with toner powder.

00:32:54,421 --> 00:32:56,323
Excuse me.

00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:58,041
Does Kevin Greer
use this machine

00:32:58,041 --> 00:32:59,166
for any of his
personal projects?

00:32:59,166 --> 00:33:01,235
Yeah. He binds his comic books.

00:33:13,834 --> 00:33:16,837
Kevin Greer,
Las Vegas Police.

00:33:16,903 --> 00:33:17,904
Hit it.

00:33:28,125 --> 00:33:29,159
Clear.

00:33:30,394 --> 00:33:32,396
( <i>rattling</i> )

00:33:33,563 --> 00:33:34,598
Check its noice.

00:33:34,664 --> 00:33:36,533
Clear.

00:33:38,668 --> 00:33:40,871
( <i>rattling grows louder</i> )

00:33:59,083 --> 00:34:00,667
A paint mixer.

00:34:00,667 --> 00:34:03,120
WLVU Blue.

00:34:03,187 --> 00:34:04,955
So he mixed his own paint

00:34:05,022 --> 00:34:08,459
so we couldn't trace the origin
of his purchase.

00:34:08,526 --> 00:34:10,194
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

00:34:11,262 --> 00:34:12,296
( <i>beep</i> )

00:34:12,363 --> 00:34:14,465
GREER:
Las Vegas's finest.

00:34:14,532 --> 00:34:16,000
Nice job.

00:34:16,066 --> 00:34:17,902
Impressive turnout.

00:34:17,968 --> 00:34:19,603
Have a look around.

00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:24,275
I'll be here at the station
waiting for you.

00:34:29,447 --> 00:34:32,349
Gil, Jim.

00:34:35,686 --> 00:34:37,188
Yeah, my rule was:

00:34:37,254 --> 00:34:40,424
If you made it to my house,
you deserved to meet me.

00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:45,329
I mean, how much time
did you guys spend

00:34:45,396 --> 00:34:47,298
picturing the size of my hands?

00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,270
Not very big.

00:34:53,337 --> 00:34:56,674
You don't need big hands,
though, not the way I do it.

00:34:56,740 --> 00:35:01,579
Just... just a little at a time.

00:35:04,415 --> 00:35:07,885
Take life, give it back.

00:35:07,952 --> 00:35:09,286
God-like.

00:35:09,353 --> 00:35:11,622
KEVIN:
God-like?

00:35:13,224 --> 00:35:14,859
No.

00:35:17,962 --> 00:35:22,199
But there must be something
angelic in the way I look,

00:35:22,266 --> 00:35:25,469
because even on
their last breath,

00:35:25,536 --> 00:35:29,140
they didn't think
I'd actually do it.

00:35:30,808 --> 00:35:33,110
Am I disappointing you guys?

00:35:33,177 --> 00:35:37,214
I mean, are you looking at me,
wishing I was...

00:35:37,281 --> 00:35:39,383
scarier?

00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:42,319
No.

00:35:42,386 --> 00:35:47,424
I was, uh, wondering what
happened to your glasses.

00:35:50,528 --> 00:35:53,130
Stupid Lasik.

00:35:53,197 --> 00:35:54,532
It's what got me caught.

00:35:55,666 --> 00:35:57,101
Is it?

00:35:57,168 --> 00:35:59,703
When that Debby bitch
busted my glasses...

00:36:00,671 --> 00:36:03,507
I decided they were
a liability.

00:36:05,009 --> 00:36:07,278
But the procedure didn't take.

00:36:07,344 --> 00:36:11,081
Is that why you missed
last year's anniversary?

00:36:11,148 --> 00:36:14,118
And my night vision still sucks.

00:36:14,185 --> 00:36:15,186
( <i>wry chuckle</i> )

00:36:17,254 --> 00:36:19,490
Johnny?

00:36:25,696 --> 00:36:27,431
I don't want to talk about him.

00:36:27,498 --> 00:36:30,301
Well, you, uh, kept him
for several days

00:36:30,367 --> 00:36:32,536
before you chopped him up.

00:36:32,603 --> 00:36:34,071
Were you having a good time?

00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:42,379
I'm not into boys.

00:36:42,446 --> 00:36:44,181
( <i>hinges creaking</i> )

00:36:44,248 --> 00:36:46,150
GREER:
<i>Kid was in my freezer.</i>

00:37:00,598 --> 00:37:02,066
Wait a minute.

00:37:05,469 --> 00:37:07,505
There are six here.

00:37:07,571 --> 00:37:09,907
We only know of five.

00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,183
Tell us about Charlene Roth.

00:37:20,384 --> 00:37:22,486
You had to bring her up.

00:37:22,553 --> 00:37:25,356
You know, I tried to
talk him out of it,

00:37:25,422 --> 00:37:27,658
but, uh, J.M wouldn't...

00:37:27,725 --> 00:37:29,126
John Mathers.

00:37:31,929 --> 00:37:34,031
He had something to prove.

00:37:34,098 --> 00:37:35,566
See, he didn't
understand

00:37:35,633 --> 00:37:39,214
that we were better together
than we would ever be apart.

00:37:42,706 --> 00:37:44,442
He needed me.

00:37:44,508 --> 00:37:46,043
Soul mates.

00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:48,312
Contrary to popular belief,

00:37:48,379 --> 00:37:50,915
even people like us have souls.

00:37:53,851 --> 00:37:57,653
I spent 15 years looking
for a solid replacement,

00:38:00,291 --> 00:38:04,028
but you only get that lucky
once in a lifetime.

00:38:04,094 --> 00:38:05,763
You miss him.

00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:07,465
I created him.

00:38:07,531 --> 00:38:09,266
But you let him take the fall.

00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:10,301
He got caught.

00:38:10,367 --> 00:38:13,404
That's the price you pay
for incompetence.

00:38:13,471 --> 00:38:14,405
Death.

00:38:14,472 --> 00:38:16,140
That's what you deserve

00:38:16,207 --> 00:38:17,975
when you make a mistake.

00:38:18,042 --> 00:38:20,311
( <i>knock at door</i> )

00:38:27,685 --> 00:38:29,086
There's a sixth victim.

00:38:29,153 --> 00:38:30,488
A Brit or Brittany Mosscoe.

00:38:30,554 --> 00:38:32,089
Her name was on a Ziploc bag
in Greer's freezer.

00:38:32,156 --> 00:38:33,424
It contained a lock of hair.

00:38:33,491 --> 00:38:35,126
Sara's looking
into Missing Persons.

00:38:35,192 --> 00:38:38,629
And Mia's running
it through DNA.

00:38:38,696 --> 00:38:40,231
Thanks.

00:38:49,406 --> 00:38:51,375
Where is, uh...

00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:55,112
Brit Mosscoe?

00:39:01,952 --> 00:39:04,555
There's a lot of fight in her.

00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:09,794
Is she old or new?

00:39:14,732 --> 00:39:17,668
I'll take you to her.

00:39:19,937 --> 00:39:23,507
Oh, we'll need
a full tank of gas.

00:39:32,016 --> 00:39:34,318
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

00:39:35,319 --> 00:39:36,487
Hello.

00:39:36,554 --> 00:39:41,625
Yeah, I'm trying to confirm
that you have no record

00:39:41,692 --> 00:39:45,463
of a Brit Mosscoe attending WLVU
in the last 18 years.

00:39:45,529 --> 00:39:49,700
What about a night student?

00:39:49,767 --> 00:39:51,435
Okay, thanks.

00:40:24,935 --> 00:40:30,641
Hey, uh, can I go to
the bathroom before we go?

00:40:30,708 --> 00:40:33,010
Yeah, okay.

00:40:37,915 --> 00:40:40,417
Bobbie, pat him down.

00:41:18,667 --> 00:41:19,959
Slow down.

00:41:21,542 --> 00:41:22,877
Okay...

00:41:24,011 --> 00:41:25,346
Okay.

00:41:26,313 --> 00:41:27,381
I got it.

00:41:29,083 --> 00:41:30,951
The sixth victim is a ruse.

00:41:31,018 --> 00:41:32,853
He drew her off a calendar.

00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,355
Brit Mosscoe

00:41:34,422 --> 00:41:36,424
is an anagram for Miss October.

00:41:38,592 --> 00:41:40,161
So where's he taking us?

00:41:40,227 --> 00:41:42,830
Mr. Greer, let's go. Come on.

00:41:42,897 --> 00:41:43,998
Mr. Greer?

00:41:44,065 --> 00:41:45,566
Where is he, in there?

00:41:45,633 --> 00:41:48,135
Come on, Mr. Greer, let's go!

00:41:49,503 --> 00:41:50,971
Damn it!

00:41:58,512 --> 00:41:59,947
Get a paramedic!
