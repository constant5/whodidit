00:27:40,546 --> 00:27:42,114
As you can see, at locus D3

00:27:42,181 --> 00:27:44,616
the alleles are 12 through 19.

00:27:44,683 --> 00:27:45,818
Which is normal.

00:27:45,884 --> 00:27:47,820
Right.
Now, as you can see

00:27:47,886 --> 00:27:49,288
on the sample
on the bottom,

00:27:49,354 --> 00:27:52,524
the locus D3 alleles
are 15 and 21.

00:27:52,591 --> 00:27:53,826
Not normal.

00:27:53,892 --> 00:27:56,495
The 21 allele is outside
the normal range.

00:27:56,562 --> 00:27:58,163
An "off-ladder" peak.

00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:59,498
Like Tara Matthews.

00:27:59,565 --> 00:28:00,499
Right.

00:28:00,566 --> 00:28:01,767
This is her profile.

00:28:01,834 --> 00:28:03,936
And <i>this...</i>

00:28:04,002 --> 00:28:05,671
is the DNA that was extracted

00:28:05,738 --> 00:28:08,240
from the vaginal
contribution to the sheets

00:28:08,307 --> 00:28:09,608
at the Stewart house.

00:28:09,675 --> 00:28:13,479
Tara Matthews' DNA
in Morgan Stewart's bed.

00:28:13,545 --> 00:28:15,414
We're working the same case.

00:28:18,884 --> 00:28:21,220
There were several spots
of high density polyethylene

00:28:21,286 --> 00:28:23,655
embedded in the fingers
of Tara Matthews' right hand.

00:28:23,722 --> 00:28:24,823
SIDLE:
According to Hodges,

00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:26,191
the material
is consistent

00:28:26,258 --> 00:28:27,393
with the plastic tanks

00:28:27,459 --> 00:28:29,795
in most disposable lighters.

00:28:29,862 --> 00:28:32,765
We found the top of one
at the scene of the fire.

00:28:32,831 --> 00:28:37,002
Well, heat melts plastic
and butane will explode

00:28:37,069 --> 00:28:38,203
under pressure.

00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:39,204
WILLOWS:
So the lighter

00:28:39,271 --> 00:28:40,506
blew up in her hand?

00:28:40,572 --> 00:28:41,907
Are you saying
that she...

00:28:41,974 --> 00:28:43,108
set herself on fire?

00:28:52,618 --> 00:28:54,486
It was attempted
suicide.

00:28:54,553 --> 00:28:57,356
She'd been assaulted by a truck
driver shortly before her death.

00:28:57,423 --> 00:28:58,690
She was clinically depressed.

00:28:58,757 --> 00:29:00,692
She was having problems
in her marriage.

00:29:00,759 --> 00:29:02,294
You know,
some Eastern cultures

00:29:02,361 --> 00:29:04,163
believe that fire
cleanses the soul.

00:29:04,229 --> 00:29:05,564
Well, Tara Matthews

00:29:05,631 --> 00:29:08,267
was having sex
with Morgan Stewart.

00:29:08,333 --> 00:29:10,169
So, if she
attempted suicide

00:29:10,235 --> 00:29:13,305
several hours
after the Stewarts died,

00:29:13,372 --> 00:29:15,441
she's a possible suspect.

00:29:15,507 --> 00:29:17,409
Yeah, but just having
her DNA in the bed

00:29:17,476 --> 00:29:19,545
doesn't prove she was
there for the murders.

00:29:19,611 --> 00:29:21,080
SIDLE:
What about Tara's
husband Neal?

00:29:21,146 --> 00:29:22,514
Well, according to Brass,

00:29:22,581 --> 00:29:25,551
Neal and Morgan were good
friends since they were kids.

00:29:25,617 --> 00:29:27,219
Neal was good
at making money,

00:29:27,286 --> 00:29:29,221
and Morgan was good
at making debts.

00:29:29,288 --> 00:29:30,989
Maybe Morgan

00:29:31,056 --> 00:29:32,691
was jealous of Neal,
sleeps with Tara

00:29:32,758 --> 00:29:34,927
out of spite,
Corinne finds out...

00:29:34,993 --> 00:29:37,196
GRISSOM:
And three people
end up dead.

00:29:37,262 --> 00:29:40,132
So the critical
question remains.

00:29:40,199 --> 00:29:44,136
If Morgan shot himself,
then he's the prime suspect

00:29:44,203 --> 00:29:45,504
in the murders,

00:29:45,571 --> 00:29:47,406
but if he, in fact,
was murdered,

00:29:47,473 --> 00:29:50,375
then somebody else
was in the house.

00:29:50,442 --> 00:29:51,477
Mr. Matthews.

00:29:51,543 --> 00:29:53,479
Detective Jim Brass,
Las Vegas Police.

00:29:53,545 --> 00:29:55,581
How's your wife doing?

00:29:55,647 --> 00:29:57,583
How does it look
like she's doing?

00:29:57,649 --> 00:29:59,952
You know, I just have
a couple of questions.

00:30:00,018 --> 00:30:01,587
Maybe we should talk outside.

00:30:01,653 --> 00:30:03,155
We can talk here.

00:30:03,222 --> 00:30:04,189
Okay.

00:30:04,256 --> 00:30:05,424
You know, when the detective

00:30:05,491 --> 00:30:06,492
interviewed you earlier,

00:30:06,558 --> 00:30:07,626
why didn't you tell him

00:30:07,693 --> 00:30:09,361
that your best friend
and his family

00:30:09,428 --> 00:30:10,429
had just been killed?

00:30:10,496 --> 00:30:13,065
I didn't know then.

00:30:13,132 --> 00:30:15,234
Were you
at Morgan's house yesterday?

00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,235
No.

00:30:16,301 --> 00:30:18,570
How about
your wife?

00:30:18,637 --> 00:30:20,406
Not that I know of.
Why would she?

00:30:20,472 --> 00:30:21,407
Well, she's

00:30:21,473 --> 00:30:22,908
been spending
a lot of time there.

00:30:22,975 --> 00:30:24,243
What's that supposed to mean?

00:30:24,309 --> 00:30:26,779
Your wife was having
an affair with your best friend.

00:30:26,845 --> 00:30:29,548
Look, I feel for you,
Neal; I do.

00:30:29,615 --> 00:30:33,719
Friends don't sleep
with their friend's wives.

00:30:33,786 --> 00:30:36,255
You think you know how I feel?

00:30:37,289 --> 00:30:39,058
Guilty?

00:30:41,927 --> 00:30:44,196
Yeah.

00:30:44,263 --> 00:30:46,031
I <i>do</i> feel guilty.

00:30:49,935 --> 00:30:52,805
I was unable to give
my wife what she needed.

00:30:52,871 --> 00:30:56,308
If she went to Morgan,
that's the reason.

00:30:56,375 --> 00:30:59,778
She never
handled rejection well.

00:30:59,845 --> 00:31:02,414
So, if Morgan rejected her,
how would she have taken that?

00:31:02,481 --> 00:31:04,116
Badly.

00:31:04,183 --> 00:31:06,051
Bad enough to kill?

00:31:11,557 --> 00:31:13,225
Not Tara.

00:31:26,105 --> 00:31:27,506
How's it going?

00:31:27,573 --> 00:31:28,707
Hey.

00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:34,913
This is the shot
coming <i>out</i> of Morgan's body.

00:31:36,248 --> 00:31:37,316
What's the
trajectory

00:31:37,383 --> 00:31:38,684
going into the wall?

00:31:38,751 --> 00:31:41,387
Oh, the wall trajectory
is a constant.

00:31:41,453 --> 00:31:43,389
Morgan's is
the variable here.

00:31:45,257 --> 00:31:47,326
Well, there's no way those lines
are gonna match up

00:31:47,393 --> 00:31:48,994
with Morgan all the way
over on the bed.

00:31:49,061 --> 00:31:50,562
So let's make them
line up.

00:31:58,604 --> 00:32:01,140
Hang on. If he shot
himself there...

00:32:01,206 --> 00:32:03,409
how did he end
up on the bed?

00:32:04,543 --> 00:32:06,178
He was moved.

00:32:06,245 --> 00:32:09,148
Where is the blood spatter
from the initial wound?

00:32:09,214 --> 00:32:10,349
Wait.

00:32:10,416 --> 00:32:11,617
Morgan's wound
bled out here.

00:32:11,683 --> 00:32:15,821

covered the initial spatter.

And it didn't
take long

00:38:32,383 --> 00:38:33,318
for Morgan to
hit a home run...

00:38:33,384 --> 00:38:35,219
Stop talking about it
like that.

00:38:35,286 --> 00:38:37,355
Just because she's lying
burned up in a hospital room

00:38:37,422 --> 00:38:38,723
carrying
your best friend's kid...

00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:40,358
No!
...isn't going to cut it
with the D.A.

00:38:40,425 --> 00:38:41,359
No, I'm...
Look, Neal,

00:38:41,426 --> 00:38:42,960
Not another word.
she killed three people.

00:38:43,027 --> 00:38:44,395
I want you to shut up!
Just shut up!

00:38:44,462 --> 00:38:46,397
Neal, please.
Let's go.
Go ahead and walk.

00:38:46,464 --> 00:38:47,899
Go ahead,
let Tara take the fall.

00:38:47,966 --> 00:38:49,934
She's probably not
gonna make it anyway.

00:38:50,001 --> 00:38:51,102
I love my wife.

00:38:51,169 --> 00:38:52,070
Please, Neal.
Let's go.

00:38:52,136 --> 00:38:53,404
We know you were there.

00:38:53,471 --> 00:38:54,973
We got a fragment from
a basal thermometer...

00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:56,174
You don't know
anything about her.

00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,276
I know she wanted a baby
more than she wanted

00:38:58,343 --> 00:38:59,844
to be your wife,
I know that much.

00:38:59,911 --> 00:39:02,547
So tell me what
I don't know.

00:39:07,819 --> 00:39:11,022
We were just hanging out,
having a couple beers

00:39:11,089 --> 00:39:12,457
and I got a splinter.

00:39:12,523 --> 00:39:16,094
<i>Morgan said the tweezers</i>
<i>were up in his bathroom.</i>

00:39:23,368 --> 00:39:26,437
He said it was Corinne's idea.

00:39:26,504 --> 00:39:28,139
They were just trying
to help us.

00:39:28,206 --> 00:39:29,941
We did it for Tara.

00:39:30,008 --> 00:39:31,976
You slept with my wife!

00:39:32,043 --> 00:39:33,144
No!

00:39:38,816 --> 00:39:40,351
Corinne! Call the police!

00:39:40,418 --> 00:39:41,419
Mommy.

00:39:41,486 --> 00:39:42,420
Morgan!

00:39:42,487 --> 00:39:43,621
( <i>gunshot</i> )

00:39:46,424 --> 00:39:47,492
( <i>gunshot</i> )

00:39:47,558 --> 00:39:49,060
She ran.

00:39:49,127 --> 00:39:50,728
She was going to call the cops.

00:39:50,795 --> 00:39:52,363
I was just trying to stop her.

00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:53,631
You shot her.

00:39:56,734 --> 00:39:58,636
What about Dani?

00:40:00,638 --> 00:40:02,707
I didn't know what else to do,
so I called Tara.

00:40:02,774 --> 00:40:05,810
When she came over,
saw what I'd done...

00:40:05,877 --> 00:40:07,612
she just freaked out.

00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:08,813
I made it look like

00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,648
Morgan shot Corinne and then
he killed himself.

00:40:10,715 --> 00:40:12,216
Are you out
of your mind?

00:40:12,283 --> 00:40:13,885
Do you know
what you've done?

00:40:13,951 --> 00:40:15,219
This is all because of you.

00:40:15,286 --> 00:40:16,654
BRASS:
Neal...

00:40:16,721 --> 00:40:18,489
what happened to Dani?

00:40:20,091 --> 00:40:22,226
Dani!

00:40:43,548 --> 00:40:47,919
She said we didn't deserve
to live, neither one of us.

00:40:47,986 --> 00:40:51,289
And then she just ran
out the door.

00:40:51,356 --> 00:40:54,993
I was afraid she was going
to try to kill herself.

00:40:57,762 --> 00:40:59,764
All we wanted was a baby.
