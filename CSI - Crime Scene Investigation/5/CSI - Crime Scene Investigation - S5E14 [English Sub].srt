00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,452
BRASS:
BOLO out on the vehicle.

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,250
Missing Persons:
Lori Kyman.

00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,542
Husband said she went out
with some girlfriends

00:00:16,542 --> 00:00:18,250
earlier this evening,
and never came home.

00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:19,351
CURTIS:
FOS.

00:00:19,418 --> 00:00:20,585
What's an FOS?

00:00:20,652 --> 00:00:22,387
Friend of the sheriff.

00:00:22,454 --> 00:00:25,324
How else do you get listed
as a missing person so quickly?

00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,435
Doors are locked.

00:00:30,502 --> 00:00:31,870
No key in the ignition.

00:00:34,105 --> 00:00:35,039
No sign of struggle

00:00:35,106 --> 00:00:36,241
or foul play.

00:00:36,307 --> 00:00:38,910
Flat tire.

00:00:38,977 --> 00:00:40,578
Couple of smudges.

00:00:40,645 --> 00:00:42,046
Okay, pop it.

00:00:48,853 --> 00:00:50,155
So, she gets a flat.

00:00:50,221 --> 00:00:53,591
There's no gas station around.

00:00:53,658 --> 00:00:56,227
It's a Lexus, so
there's no On‐Star.

00:00:56,294 --> 00:00:58,563
She must have had some kind
of emergency roadside service.

00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:00,832
BRASS:
I ran her
cell phone log.

00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:02,534
She made one call to
her husband at 9:30.

00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,435
Said she was coming home
at 11:00; that's it.

00:01:04,502 --> 00:01:09,073
Maybe some good Samaritan
offered her a lift.

00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,608
Yeah, and evidently

00:01:10,675 --> 00:01:13,011
didn't take her
where she wanted to go.

Lori hadn't
gotten out much

00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:48,743
since Joey was born.

00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:52,417
She needed some time away
from the baby, and from me.

00:01:52,792 --> 00:01:54,460
Girls' night out.

00:01:54,527 --> 00:01:56,629
We've been best friends
since high school.

00:01:56,696 --> 00:01:58,064
Where'd you go?

00:01:58,131 --> 00:02:00,400
The Top Floor.

00:02:00,466 --> 00:02:02,068
That's right next

00:02:02,135 --> 00:02:03,870
to O'Shea's.

00:02:03,937 --> 00:02:06,105
Amy, why don't
you and I

00:02:06,172 --> 00:02:07,907
go into
the other room?
Okay.

00:02:07,974 --> 00:02:09,876
He's going to need
his bottle soon.

00:02:09,943 --> 00:02:11,678
I'll take care of it.

00:02:11,744 --> 00:02:13,580
So, Mark,
you were home

00:02:13,646 --> 00:02:15,014
alone with the baby last night?

00:02:15,081 --> 00:02:16,182
No. Uh, I, uh,

00:02:16,249 --> 00:02:18,251
I manage the steakhouse
at the Tangiers.

00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:19,752
I got home
around 9:00.

00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:22,322
My mother‐in‐law
was taking care of Joey.

00:02:22,388 --> 00:02:23,423
Your mother‐in‐law.

00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:24,691
I'll need to speak with her.

00:02:24,757 --> 00:02:26,859
Yeah, she's on her way over.

00:02:26,926 --> 00:02:28,728
( <i>baby cooing</i> )

00:02:28,795 --> 00:02:30,230
She's in love with her baby.

00:02:30,296 --> 00:02:32,232
She wouldn't go anywhere
without him.

00:02:32,298 --> 00:02:33,233
What about Mark?

00:02:33,299 --> 00:02:34,267
Mark loves Lori.

00:02:34,334 --> 00:02:36,236
He would never hurt her.

00:02:36,302 --> 00:02:37,437
When a wife disappears,

00:02:37,503 --> 00:02:39,372
it's protocol
to look at the husband.

00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:41,140
( <i>sighing</i> )

00:02:41,207 --> 00:02:44,277
I promised
I would never say anything.

00:02:44,344 --> 00:02:48,047
Before the baby was born,
she suspected he was cheating.

00:02:48,114 --> 00:02:50,216
But then Joey came,

00:02:50,283 --> 00:02:52,285
and last night at the club,
Lori said things were great.

00:02:52,352 --> 00:02:54,787
Did anything unusual
happen last night?

00:02:54,854 --> 00:02:55,922
( <i>cooing</i> )

00:02:55,989 --> 00:02:58,758
There was this one guy
who kept moving in on Lori.

00:02:58,825 --> 00:03:00,960
Hi. Could I ask you a question?

00:03:01,027 --> 00:03:02,195
It's critical.

00:03:02,262 --> 00:03:03,463
Okay.

00:03:03,529 --> 00:03:04,797
Am I your type?

00:03:04,864 --> 00:03:06,266
I'm married.

00:03:06,332 --> 00:03:07,634
Oh, yeah?

00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,935
Nice try.

00:03:09,002 --> 00:03:10,303
Ring.

00:03:11,771 --> 00:03:13,973
I think his name is Brad.

00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,075
Does Lori always go out
without a ring?

00:03:16,142 --> 00:03:17,744
She had lost some weight.

00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:19,712
It was being resized.

00:03:19,779 --> 00:03:21,447
BRASS:
<i>So, Lori calls you at 9:30</i>

00:03:21,514 --> 00:03:23,082
to check on the baby.

00:03:23,149 --> 00:03:24,984
Yeah. Said she missed him.

00:03:25,051 --> 00:03:26,920
Said she was going
to be home at 11:00.

00:03:26,986 --> 00:03:28,454
I, uh,

00:03:28,521 --> 00:03:31,324
passed out on the couch
waiting for her.

00:03:31,391 --> 00:03:33,426
We stopped drinking at 10:00.

00:03:33,493 --> 00:03:35,295
Left about an hour later.

00:03:35,361 --> 00:03:37,130
What about the guy‐‐ Brad?

00:03:37,196 --> 00:03:39,899
He didn't get the hint.

00:03:43,803 --> 00:03:45,605
He seemed harmless.

00:03:45,672 --> 00:03:48,808
Horny... but harmless.

00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:51,611
I, uh, I woke up,
must have been about 2:00.

00:03:51,678 --> 00:03:53,413
I called her
on her cell.

00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:54,747
No answer.

00:03:54,814 --> 00:03:56,783
And then I called Amy.

00:03:58,785 --> 00:04:01,087
And then I called you guys.

00:04:01,154 --> 00:04:03,790
So, you haven't left the house
since you got home last night?

00:04:03,856 --> 00:04:06,025
We, uh, only have
one car right now.

00:04:06,092 --> 00:04:07,293
My lease ran out.

00:04:08,127 --> 00:04:09,729
Any news?

00:04:13,933 --> 00:04:16,970
They found her car
off Boulder Highway.

00:04:17,036 --> 00:04:18,771
Oh, my God.

00:04:20,006 --> 00:04:22,842
This is Diane, Lori's mom.
Hi.

00:04:22,909 --> 00:04:23,843
Diane, I want you to know

00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,111
we have
every available officer

00:04:25,178 --> 00:04:26,179
out looking for your daughter.

00:04:26,246 --> 00:04:27,280
Thank you.

00:04:27,347 --> 00:04:28,781
Where's Joey?

00:04:28,848 --> 00:04:30,283
He's with Amy.

00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,351
Okay.

00:04:31,417 --> 00:04:32,452
You know, I just got

00:04:32,518 --> 00:04:33,853
a quick couple of questions.

00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,855
Can you confirm
you were here last night

00:04:35,922 --> 00:04:37,290
when Mark came
home from work?

00:04:37,357 --> 00:04:38,524
Yes. I was baby‐sitting.

00:04:38,591 --> 00:04:39,859
What time was that?

00:04:39,926 --> 00:04:42,495
Uh... I'd just
put Joey down.

00:04:42,562 --> 00:04:44,330
A little
after 9:00.

00:04:44,397 --> 00:04:45,832
And when did your daughter call?

00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:47,166
About half an hour later.

00:04:47,233 --> 00:04:48,401
We both talked to her.

00:04:48,468 --> 00:04:49,903
BRASS:
9:30. Thanks.

00:04:49,969 --> 00:04:51,237
That's all for now, thank you.

00:04:51,304 --> 00:04:52,739
Excuse me.

00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,174
What do I do?

00:04:55,241 --> 00:04:57,510
I'd take care of your family,
Mark.

00:04:57,577 --> 00:05:00,880
And if Ms. Sidle asks,
volunteer your fingerprints

00:05:00,947 --> 00:05:02,815
and DNA.

00:05:04,884 --> 00:05:09,389
RANGER:
I was making my 16:45 scan
when I saw the body.

00:05:09,455 --> 00:05:11,858
I confirmed he was deceased.

00:05:11,925 --> 00:05:13,893
Then I called you guys.

00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,028
Hey.

00:05:15,094 --> 00:05:16,663
There's no ID
on the vic.

00:05:16,729 --> 00:05:18,364
Lividity is set.

00:05:18,431 --> 00:05:20,400
Rigidity is still present.

00:05:20,466 --> 00:05:22,535
Dead no more than 24 hours.

00:05:22,602 --> 00:05:24,771
WARRICK:
Look at those
claw marks.

00:05:24,837 --> 00:05:26,539
His carotid artery
is ripped to shreds.

00:05:26,606 --> 00:05:29,409
He's got a high‐powered rifle.

00:05:31,177 --> 00:05:33,012
He's obviously a hunter, huh?

00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:34,948
Safe to say he was mauled
by a wild animal?

00:05:35,014 --> 00:05:36,115
Yeah.

00:05:36,182 --> 00:05:38,618
Your call came in
as "suspicious circs."

00:05:38,685 --> 00:05:40,753
Is there something else
we should know about?

00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,622
Yeah, that would be
the other body.

00:05:42,689 --> 00:05:43,923
Follow me.

00:05:49,295 --> 00:05:51,631
Damn.

00:05:51,698 --> 00:05:52,999
It's a Kodiak.

00:05:53,066 --> 00:05:55,868
It's nonnative
to the continental US.

00:05:55,935 --> 00:06:00,106
Shot twice
in the head.

00:06:00,173 --> 00:06:01,374
The stomach's been cut open.

00:06:03,843 --> 00:06:05,245
WARRICK:
That's a pretty deep cut.

00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,412
You think the hunter

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,381
was just trying
to defend himself?

00:06:08,448 --> 00:06:10,183
I didn't find a blade
on the decedent.

00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,252
And there's no way a person
can come this close

00:06:12,318 --> 00:06:13,319
to a live bear.

00:06:14,654 --> 00:06:16,589
STOKES:
Got some broken branches
over here.

00:06:18,091 --> 00:06:20,827
Directionality
faces away from the victim

00:06:20,894 --> 00:06:22,061
and the animal.

00:06:26,065 --> 00:06:28,134
Looks like someone
even tore their pants.

00:06:28,201 --> 00:06:30,303
Khakis.

00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:32,272
Vic's wearing jeans
and a nylon vest.

00:06:32,338 --> 00:06:34,908
I bet somebody else
was out here,

00:06:34,974 --> 00:06:37,977
and they were running
for their life.

00:06:39,412 --> 00:06:40,613
I had to see

00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,848
with my own eyes.

00:06:41,915 --> 00:06:44,317
You're actually
autopsying a bear.

00:06:44,384 --> 00:06:45,652
It's called a necropsy.

00:06:45,718 --> 00:06:48,388
And as the head ME,
it falls under my purview.

00:06:48,454 --> 00:06:50,023
I'll write an article
for the journal.

00:06:50,089 --> 00:06:51,991
They love this sort of stuff.

00:06:52,058 --> 00:06:55,929
Yeah. You have a cause of death
on him?

00:06:55,995 --> 00:06:57,931
I can confirm he was killed
by an angry bear.

00:07:00,733 --> 00:07:01,768
As for the bear‐‐

00:07:01,834 --> 00:07:03,303
two bullets
to the head.

00:07:03,369 --> 00:07:06,940
The first, nonfatal,
was a straight‐on shot.

00:07:07,006 --> 00:07:09,475
Bears' foreheads are sloped,
so the bullet

00:07:09,542 --> 00:07:12,145
ricocheted off the skull,
leaving a copper jacket,

00:07:12,211 --> 00:07:17,217
which peeled away
and embedded in the hide.

00:07:18,751 --> 00:07:20,853
The, uh,
fatal bullet

00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,222
entered
through the ear,

00:07:22,288 --> 00:07:23,256
lodged in the brain.

00:07:23,323 --> 00:07:24,324
I removed it already.

00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,692
WILLOWS:
It's lead.

00:07:25,758 --> 00:07:27,126
No copper jacket.

00:07:27,193 --> 00:07:29,395
So, the copper jacket
had to have come

00:07:29,462 --> 00:07:30,630
from his rifle.

00:07:30,697 --> 00:07:31,965
But this is from

00:07:32,031 --> 00:07:33,333
a handgun.

00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:34,867
So, he shot one bullet
with his rifle

00:07:34,934 --> 00:07:36,069
and another with his pistol.

00:07:36,135 --> 00:07:38,037
Except he didn't have a pistol.

00:07:38,104 --> 00:07:39,839
Or a knife, for that matter.

00:07:39,906 --> 00:07:42,242
And his stomach
has been slashed open.

00:07:42,308 --> 00:07:45,345
Yeah, and
the gallbladder removed.

00:07:45,411 --> 00:07:46,713
Really?

00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:48,214
Postmortem.

00:07:48,281 --> 00:07:49,816
I can't tell you why.

00:08:23,149 --> 00:08:25,285
Hey. I ran the
vic's prints.

00:08:25,351 --> 00:08:26,719
Didn't get a hit.

00:08:26,786 --> 00:08:29,556
We found this guy
25 miles from civilization.

00:08:29,622 --> 00:08:30,924
Where'd he come from?

00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,225
We know someone else
was out there.

00:08:32,292 --> 00:08:33,359
Maybe he drove.

00:08:35,628 --> 00:08:38,665
Check out this guy's watch.

00:08:38,731 --> 00:08:41,067
It's pretty high‐end.

00:08:41,134 --> 00:08:43,269
Yeah. Hunting's not exactly

00:08:43,336 --> 00:08:45,071
a poor man's sport.

00:08:45,138 --> 00:08:47,974
US presidents still hold up
dead ducks for photo ops.

00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:50,043
But it just doesn't match
with the guy's clothes.

00:08:50,109 --> 00:08:51,077
They're kind of
raggedy.

00:08:51,144 --> 00:08:52,111
He's got
dirt stains.

00:08:52,178 --> 00:08:53,313
I could smell the BO

00:08:53,379 --> 00:08:54,747
from the guy's shirt from here.

00:08:54,814 --> 00:08:56,950
Some hunters think
soap and deodorant

00:08:57,016 --> 00:08:58,117
tip off their prey.

00:08:58,184 --> 00:09:00,553
Truth is, body odor's
much more pungent.

00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,322
So, Robbins confirmed

00:09:02,388 --> 00:09:04,991
that our vic was
killed by the bear.

00:09:05,058 --> 00:09:06,893
Okay. Case closed.

00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,595
Uh, not quite.

00:09:08,661 --> 00:09:09,963
I spoke with
the ranger.

00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:11,397
There's no way
that a Kodiak bear

00:09:11,464 --> 00:09:12,498
just wanders
into Nevada,

00:09:12,565 --> 00:09:13,633
so whoever
smuggled him in

00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,134
could be charged
with homicide.

00:09:15,201 --> 00:09:16,636
How's that?

00:09:16,703 --> 00:09:19,272
The bear could be considered
a lethal weapon.

00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:24,644
Screw.

00:09:24,711 --> 00:09:26,012
Excuse me?

00:09:26,079 --> 00:09:27,947
Tire's valve stem
was unscrewed.

00:09:28,014 --> 00:09:29,849
Two full turns.

00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:31,517
A slow leaker.

00:09:31,584 --> 00:09:34,687
Print around the fender.

00:10:07,253 --> 00:10:08,688
Yeah, I was at the Top Floor.

00:10:08,755 --> 00:10:09,923
I hit on a lot of girls.

00:10:09,989 --> 00:10:11,758
You can't arrest me for that,
right?

00:10:11,824 --> 00:10:13,326
BRASS:
Tell us
about Lori Kyman.

00:10:13,393 --> 00:10:16,663
Yeah, I remember a Lori.

00:10:16,729 --> 00:10:17,997
( <i>laughs</i> )

00:10:18,064 --> 00:10:19,132
Said she was married.

00:10:19,198 --> 00:10:20,233
Yeah, right.

00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,001
You dress up like that
and go to a club...

00:10:22,068 --> 00:10:23,069
( <i>clicks tongue</i> )

00:10:23,136 --> 00:10:24,304
...you're looking
to get some.

00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:27,807
I found your fingerprints
on her car's fender.

00:10:27,874 --> 00:10:30,310
So? I walked her
back to her car.

00:10:30,376 --> 00:10:31,578
I am a gentleman.

00:10:31,644 --> 00:10:34,013
Is that when you messed
with her tire?

00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,217
Is that what this is about?

00:10:37,283 --> 00:10:38,484
I don't get out much.

00:10:38,551 --> 00:10:39,852
Why would you do that?

00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:42,155
I was hoping it would go flat
on her way back home,

00:10:42,222 --> 00:10:43,890
and I'd come along
and fix it for her.

00:10:43,957 --> 00:10:45,992
And then she'd
be appropriately

00:10:46,059 --> 00:10:48,061
grateful, and what,
sleep with you?

00:10:48,127 --> 00:10:51,397
Seemed like a good idea
at the time, yeah.

00:10:51,464 --> 00:10:52,966
'Course I was tanked.

00:10:53,032 --> 00:10:54,434
Okay, so Lori's tire went flat.

00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,735
That's the thing:
it didn't.

00:10:55,802 --> 00:10:58,271
I mean, I followed her
for like 20 minutes.

00:10:58,338 --> 00:10:59,505
Way off Strip.

00:10:59,572 --> 00:11:00,673
And, come on,

00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,408
how long can you follow
someone for, right?

00:11:02,475 --> 00:11:03,843
She never made it home.

00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:07,814
I don't know anything
about that.

00:11:07,881 --> 00:11:09,983
We're going to need
a sample of your DNA.

00:11:10,049 --> 00:11:10,984
Any objections?

00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:12,218
Excuse me.

00:11:12,285 --> 00:11:13,987
Excuse me, Captain.

00:11:14,053 --> 00:11:15,822
Found a dead female in Sutor.

00:11:15,889 --> 00:11:17,690
Description matches

00:11:17,757 --> 00:11:19,225
Lori Kyman.

00:11:22,395 --> 00:11:23,796
Make yourself comfortable.

00:11:31,371 --> 00:11:34,374
Guy walking his dog found her.

00:11:39,746 --> 00:11:41,948
EXAMINER:
Liver temp's 71 degrees.

00:11:42,015 --> 00:11:43,383
Given the ambient temperature,

00:11:44,372 --> 00:11:48,054
her TOD's is roughly between 
36 to 40 hours ago.

00:11:55,628 --> 00:11:58,131
Bruises on the neck

00:11:58,197 --> 00:12:00,967
suggest strangulation.

00:12:06,372 --> 00:12:08,541
No attempt to hide the body.

00:12:08,608 --> 00:12:10,143
Maybe the suspect
was in a hurry.

00:12:11,377 --> 00:12:12,478
Or he just didn't

00:12:12,545 --> 00:12:14,247
give a damn.

00:12:14,314 --> 00:12:16,216
Are you gonna tell the family?

00:12:16,282 --> 00:12:18,251
Yeah, how do you tell
a little boy

00:12:18,318 --> 00:12:20,320
he'll never know his mother?

00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:27,294
She was dumped
under a white birch.

00:12:27,294 --> 00:12:30,458
Her hair is full of pods
and tree vegetation.

00:12:43,076 --> 00:12:45,979
Red fibers and blue fibers
on her dress.

00:12:53,834 --> 00:12:56,036
White powder on both palms.

00:13:06,917 --> 00:13:08,792
A brown hair

00:13:08,792 --> 00:13:10,594
with a follicular tag.

00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:13,898
A person's entire identity

00:13:13,964 --> 00:13:15,232
balled up

00:13:15,299 --> 00:13:18,002
in a few nanograms of matter.

00:13:18,068 --> 00:13:22,406
Assuming one's identity can be
wholly quantified by our DNA.

00:13:22,473 --> 00:13:23,941
Well, genetically, it can.

00:13:24,008 --> 00:13:26,977
We're completely programmed as
soon as the sperm hits the egg.

00:13:27,044 --> 00:13:30,281
So we're defined
at a cellular level?

00:13:30,347 --> 00:13:31,282
More or less.

00:13:31,348 --> 00:13:32,449
No.

00:13:32,516 --> 00:13:35,419
Identity is the totality
of our life experiences.

00:13:35,486 --> 00:13:38,255
And our brain neurons
process

00:13:38,322 --> 00:13:40,758
our relationship to the world
and each other.

00:13:40,824 --> 00:13:42,660
( <i>camera clicks</i> )
I stand corrected.

00:13:42,726 --> 00:13:45,696
DNA is what we are,
not who we are.

00:13:45,763 --> 00:13:47,231
What we are never changes.

00:13:47,298 --> 00:13:49,133
Who we are never stops changing.

00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,969
Yeah. Whether we like it or not.

00:13:52,036 --> 00:13:53,103
( <i>camera clicks</i> )

00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:54,171
What's up?

00:13:54,238 --> 00:13:55,906
Well, when I
fluoroscoped the bear,

00:13:55,973 --> 00:13:57,274
looking for other bullets,

00:13:57,341 --> 00:13:59,343
I noticed a microchip
between his shoulder blades.

00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:01,545
WILLOWS:
I see.

00:14:01,612 --> 00:14:02,980
I removed it,
called Animal Control

00:14:03,047 --> 00:14:04,181
to borrow a magnetic reader.

00:14:04,248 --> 00:14:05,883
Check it out.

00:14:08,385 --> 00:14:10,120
( <i>beeping</i> )

00:14:10,187 --> 00:14:12,690
I tracked it down:
Clark County Zoo.

00:14:21,999 --> 00:14:24,034
MAN:
Are you sure the bear
came from our zoo?

00:14:24,101 --> 00:14:26,337
Well, the microchip was
registered to you.

00:14:26,403 --> 00:14:27,471
Take a look.

00:14:27,538 --> 00:14:29,540
Oh, God.

00:14:29,607 --> 00:14:31,041
It's Tippy.

00:14:31,108 --> 00:14:32,843
What happened?

00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:35,045
You mean you didn't
know he was missing?

00:14:35,112 --> 00:14:36,614
We sold him to a broker
a few weeks ago.

00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,516
He said he found him a home
at the Columbus Zoo.

00:14:38,582 --> 00:14:40,184
A broker?
Animal broker.

00:14:40,251 --> 00:14:41,685
Visitors want to see babies.

00:14:41,752 --> 00:14:43,153
The brokers find other zoos

00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,222
to purchase our
surplus adult animals.

00:14:47,391 --> 00:14:49,426
You know, Tippy was so gentle,

00:14:49,493 --> 00:14:50,794
he'd eat grapes
right out of my hand.

00:14:50,861 --> 00:14:52,897
Well, we're going to need
to see some paperwork.

00:14:52,963 --> 00:14:54,498
Yeah, I'll pull the file, but...

00:14:54,565 --> 00:14:55,933
I remember the broker's name.

00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,001
It's Ken Bovitz.

00:14:57,067 --> 00:14:57,968
Out of Chicago.

00:14:58,035 --> 00:14:59,570
He mailed me
his broker's license

00:14:59,637 --> 00:15:00,638
and documentation.

00:15:00,704 --> 00:15:02,573
The board approved the sale
last fall.

00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,042
( <i>sighs</i> ):
They'll want to know
what went wrong.

00:15:05,109 --> 00:15:07,411
Yeah, so do we.

00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:10,166
SANDERS:
You giving the car a workout?

00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:11,234
Well, you know
how you said

00:15:11,301 --> 00:15:13,269
that the suspect admitted
to following Lori,

00:15:13,336 --> 00:15:15,605
but when the tire
didn't go flat, he gave up?

00:15:15,672 --> 00:15:17,774
Grissom wants me to
disprove his account.

00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,777
How long has the wheel been
going round and round?

00:15:20,843 --> 00:15:23,313
Three hours and nine minutes.

00:15:23,379 --> 00:15:25,949
She left the club
around 11:00.

00:15:26,015 --> 00:15:29,452
Time of death was between
midnight and 1:00 a. m.

00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,554
Lori died
before the tire went flat.

00:15:33,456 --> 00:15:36,826
WARRICK:
I think I know why someone
snagged that bear's gallbladder.

00:15:36,893 --> 00:15:39,529
Apparently, in the southeast
Asian community,

00:15:39,596 --> 00:15:42,198
some men believe
it enhances their virility.

00:15:42,265 --> 00:15:44,300
It contains
some chemical called

00:15:44,367 --> 00:15:46,703
ursodeoxycholic acid.

00:15:46,769 --> 00:15:49,639
These gallbladders are going
for $500 a pop.

00:15:49,706 --> 00:15:51,140
I, uh, talked to
the zoo in Columbus.

00:15:51,207 --> 00:15:52,242
They never heard of Tippy.

00:15:52,308 --> 00:15:54,811
Hmm. Any luck
with the broker?

00:15:54,878 --> 00:15:56,279
The Department of Agriculture

00:15:56,346 --> 00:15:58,448
never issued a license
for a Ken Bovitz.

00:15:58,514 --> 00:15:59,949
Documents are fake.

00:16:00,016 --> 00:16:02,252
I sent them to QD
for analysis.

00:16:03,586 --> 00:16:05,655
We may have an ID
on our hunter.

00:16:05,722 --> 00:16:07,824
Uniforms found
an abandoned Mercedes.

00:16:07,891 --> 00:16:09,859
Plates came back
to a Mr. Ron Hollis,

00:16:09,926 --> 00:16:12,161
who had hunting permits
that included tags

00:16:12,228 --> 00:16:15,131
for wild goats, deer,
and bighorn sheep.

00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:16,699
And what about Kodiaks?

00:16:16,766 --> 00:16:17,967
That would be a no.

00:16:18,034 --> 00:16:19,702
Mr. Hollis's wife's
on her way to PD,

00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:23,439
so I'm gonna head over there
right now.

00:16:23,506 --> 00:16:27,544
To be honest, I haven't seen
my husband in over a year.

00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:28,478
STOKES:
You were separated?

00:16:28,545 --> 00:16:31,514
He made it big
in venture capital.

00:16:31,581 --> 00:16:32,815
Retired at 32.

00:16:32,882 --> 00:16:34,350
That's when we started

00:16:34,417 --> 00:16:36,619
having problems.

00:16:36,686 --> 00:16:38,788
The officer said
Rod died while hunting.

00:16:38,855 --> 00:16:40,156
Can I ask what happened?

00:16:40,223 --> 00:16:43,693
He was mauled by a bear.

00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,529
Ms. Hollis, I have
reason to believe

00:16:46,596 --> 00:16:48,565
there was somebody else
out there with him.

00:16:48,631 --> 00:16:49,899
Any idea who?

00:16:49,966 --> 00:16:51,301
No.

00:16:51,367 --> 00:16:52,802
In our circle of friends,

00:16:52,869 --> 00:16:54,938
he was the only one
who owned a gun.

00:16:55,004 --> 00:16:57,740
We used to fight
about his sport.

00:16:57,807 --> 00:17:00,677
I showed him studies about
how the animals suffer,

00:17:00,743 --> 00:17:03,713
how even the best hunters
don't always get center shots.

00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:08,618
Well... I guess brutality
begets brutality.

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,858
ROBBINS:
COD is asphyxia due
to manual strangulation.

00:17:14,924 --> 00:17:17,193
Petechiae in the eyes and mouth

00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:20,330
and extensive bruising in
the strap muscles of the neck.

00:17:20,396 --> 00:17:21,497
Sexual assault?

00:17:21,564 --> 00:17:22,899
No abrasions or contusions

00:17:22,966 --> 00:17:23,933
to the vagina.

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,702
No semen on the SART exam.

00:17:29,806 --> 00:17:30,940
Is this a burn?

00:17:31,007 --> 00:17:32,976
No tissue reaction
means it's post‐mortem.

00:17:34,143 --> 00:17:35,445
If she were alive
at the time,

00:17:35,511 --> 00:17:37,280
it'd have a red edge.

00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:38,781
This one's bland.

00:17:38,848 --> 00:17:41,017
Burn extends subcutaneously,
so the skin made contact

00:17:41,084 --> 00:17:42,886
with something hotter
than 150 degrees.

00:17:45,855 --> 00:17:47,790
Talk to me, Hodges.

00:17:47,857 --> 00:17:50,360
Well, you kind of
inundated me with work.

00:17:50,426 --> 00:17:52,028
I should be cranky.

00:17:52,095 --> 00:17:53,396
But, uh, I don't get cranky.

00:17:53,463 --> 00:17:55,098
Let's start with
the white powder you found

00:17:55,164 --> 00:17:56,332
on your victim's bands.

00:17:56,399 --> 00:17:58,067
It's talcum power
without the talc.

00:17:58,134 --> 00:18:00,103
Excuse me?
Talcum powder can contain

00:18:00,169 --> 00:18:01,337
asbestos fibers.

00:18:01,404 --> 00:18:03,273
Who wants to put asbestos
on their baby?

00:18:03,339 --> 00:18:05,775
So, today's baby powders
are made from cornstarch,

00:18:05,842 --> 00:18:07,644
and are technically
talc‐free.

00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:09,712
Did your victim have her baby
with her at the club?

00:18:09,779 --> 00:18:11,614
No, he was at home.

00:18:11,681 --> 00:18:13,316
So maybe the baby powder
was on her hands

00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:14,651
when she left the house.

00:18:14,717 --> 00:18:17,420
Well, we know she was drinking,
so she was probably peeing.

00:18:17,487 --> 00:18:19,289
And unlike

00:18:19,355 --> 00:18:21,925
some of the men in this lab,
whose initials are Greg Sanders,

00:18:21,991 --> 00:18:23,826
she probably
washes her hands.

00:18:23,893 --> 00:18:25,762
So the baby powder
shouldn't even be there.

00:18:25,828 --> 00:18:28,731
Tell me about the fibers
we collected from her clothing.

00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:31,201
Blue ones have a high twist rate

00:18:31,267 --> 00:18:33,469
and are composed of nylon
and polyester olefins.

00:18:33,536 --> 00:18:35,438
I'd say synthetic Berber.

00:18:35,505 --> 00:18:38,074
And the red ones
are under the scope.

00:18:42,011 --> 00:18:43,947
CURTIS:
Trilobal.

00:18:44,013 --> 00:18:45,281
From a car.

00:18:46,716 --> 00:18:48,651
Vic's clothing
was covered in them.

00:18:48,718 --> 00:18:50,687
My guess, she was rolling around
in someone's trunk.

00:18:53,756 --> 00:18:55,291
Can you be more specific?

00:18:55,358 --> 00:18:57,193
You bet.

00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,428
It's Wilton wool.

00:18:58,494 --> 00:18:59,529
Very high‐end.

00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,030
And given the unique
shade of red,

00:19:01,097 --> 00:19:02,599
I'd say that you're looking

00:19:02,665 --> 00:19:04,300
at the world's fastest
four‐seat coupe:

00:19:04,367 --> 00:19:06,603
the Bentley Continental GT.

00:19:08,104 --> 00:19:09,572
Thank you.

00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:18,848
MAN:
Yeah, I was here last night.

00:19:18,915 --> 00:19:20,984
CURTIS:
You park a Bentley?

00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:24,087
Oh, man, my memory's
not so good since, um...

00:19:25,355 --> 00:19:28,157
Well, I can't really remember.

00:19:28,224 --> 00:19:29,526
You don't remember a Bentley?

00:19:29,592 --> 00:19:31,828
Let me see what I got.

00:19:31,895 --> 00:19:33,296
Yeah.

00:19:35,431 --> 00:19:38,134
Yeah, here you go.
One Bentley.

00:19:38,201 --> 00:19:39,969
Came in at 8:32.

00:19:40,036 --> 00:19:41,738
Parked it in spot 19C.

00:19:41,804 --> 00:19:43,506
Do you remember, uh,
what the driver looked like?

00:19:43,573 --> 00:19:45,208
Male?

00:19:45,275 --> 00:19:47,911
Female? Black? Caucasian?

00:19:47,977 --> 00:19:49,245
Young? Old?

00:19:49,312 --> 00:19:50,513
He have a hat on?

00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,081
Sorry.

00:19:52,148 --> 00:19:53,950
Sorry.

00:19:55,051 --> 00:19:56,920
Amy.

00:19:56,986 --> 00:19:58,855
Thanks for coming.

00:19:58,922 --> 00:20:01,357
Of course. How can I help?

00:20:01,424 --> 00:20:03,259
The other night at
the club, I was wondering

00:20:03,326 --> 00:20:05,495
if you happened to notice
anyone driving a Bentley.

00:20:05,562 --> 00:20:07,230
That would be me.

00:20:07,297 --> 00:20:08,932
Birthday gift from my father.

00:20:08,998 --> 00:20:11,034
Would you mind
if I took a look at it?

00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,469
You want to see my car?

00:20:13,536 --> 00:20:14,604
Why?

00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:17,707
We found fibers from a Bentley
on Lori's clothing.

00:20:17,774 --> 00:20:22,779
Lori was in my car all the time,
especially last week.

00:20:24,013 --> 00:20:26,683
Mark was using hers.

00:20:26,749 --> 00:20:30,386
The fibers we found are
from the floor or a trunk.

00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:36,893
It's in the lot.
I'll call my father.

00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,961
He'll pick me up.

00:20:38,027 --> 00:20:39,429
Amy...

00:20:39,495 --> 00:20:42,131
Did Lori use the ladies' room
at the club?

00:20:42,198 --> 00:20:43,833
Yeah.

00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,735
We both did.

00:20:45,802 --> 00:20:47,537
Do you know
if she washed her hands?

00:20:47,604 --> 00:20:49,939
Why are you asking me
all these questions?

00:20:50,006 --> 00:20:51,941
We're pursuing a lead.

00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,645
Lori was like a sister to me.

00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:57,046
Investigate me all you want,

00:20:57,113 --> 00:20:59,716
but when you're done,
you should take a look at Mark.

00:20:59,782 --> 00:21:01,517
Mark. I thought you said...

00:21:01,584 --> 00:21:03,653
I know what I said.

00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,989
That was before
she turned up dead.

00:21:06,055 --> 00:21:07,857
And I'm not saying he did it,
and Lori...

00:21:07,924 --> 00:21:10,193
she never said anything.

00:21:11,794 --> 00:21:13,129
It's just sometimes, um...

00:21:14,531 --> 00:21:15,899
he can get rough.

00:21:15,965 --> 00:21:17,767
( <i>writing</i> )

00:21:17,834 --> 00:21:21,838
And you know this because...?

00:21:24,507 --> 00:21:26,576
You were the other woman.

00:21:26,643 --> 00:21:28,411
One of them.

00:21:28,478 --> 00:21:30,013
I'm not proud of it.

00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:32,515
Did Mark get rough with you?

00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:36,286
That's why I ended it.

00:21:44,709 --> 00:21:45,977
You started without me.

00:21:46,043 --> 00:21:48,679
Actually, I finished
without you. Take a look.

00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:50,959
Carpet's black.

00:21:51,026 --> 00:21:52,594
Fibers on the vic's
clothing were red.

00:21:52,661 --> 00:21:55,964
Obviously, we can
rule out this car.

00:21:56,031 --> 00:21:58,100
I don't mean to pry,

00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:00,802
but you want to talk about what
happened with you and Ecklie?

00:22:00,869 --> 00:22:02,838
Not really.

00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:04,773
I don't know if you
know this about me,

00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,942
but I'm a good listener.

00:22:07,009 --> 00:22:10,679
I blew up at Ecklie.

00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,147
It was very unprofessional.

00:22:12,214 --> 00:22:16,585
And very satisfying,
and now I'm moving on.

00:22:18,053 --> 00:22:19,988
Thanks for asking.

00:22:22,858 --> 00:22:25,894
MARK:
<i>Joey just fell asleep,</i>

00:22:25,961 --> 00:22:27,429
so please, keep
your voices down.

00:22:27,496 --> 00:22:29,865
All we need is a sample
of baby powder.

00:22:36,972 --> 00:22:38,407
This is Berber carpet, isn't it?

00:22:38,473 --> 00:22:41,109
Yeah, Lori thought
it'd be good for a boy's room.

00:22:44,213 --> 00:22:46,648
I'd like to take a small sample.

00:22:46,715 --> 00:22:48,050
What's going on?

00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:50,018
Just collecting evidence.

00:22:50,085 --> 00:22:51,253
You're coming after me?

00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:53,856
Because I've cooperated.
I've let you swab

00:22:53,922 --> 00:22:57,960
my mouth
and let you take my prints.

00:22:58,026 --> 00:23:00,028
I love my wife.
I miss her.

00:23:15,844 --> 00:23:18,180
DNA from Lori's
shirt came back.

00:23:18,247 --> 00:23:20,015
It matches her husband.

00:23:20,082 --> 00:23:21,316
That could be probative.

00:23:21,383 --> 00:23:22,951
Or casual transfer

00:23:23,018 --> 00:23:24,920
unrelated to the case.

00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:27,155
I also picked up
your trace results.

00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:31,760
Baby powder on Lori's palms

00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:34,696
is consistent
with the baby powder we found

00:23:34,763 --> 00:23:35,898
at the Kymans' residence.

00:23:35,964 --> 00:23:37,366
According
to her girlfriend,

00:23:37,432 --> 00:23:39,568
Lori washed her hands
at the club.

00:23:39,635 --> 00:23:43,105
Which suggests that Lori came
home before she was killed.

00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:45,774
Which contradicts
the husband's account.

00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:49,378
I hate to state the obvious,
but maybe the husband is lying.

00:23:49,444 --> 00:23:53,815
All right, well, let's say
she came home first.

00:24:05,166 --> 00:24:08,969
Mark killed her, drove her out
to Sutor, and dumped the body.

00:24:09,036 --> 00:24:10,771
One problem.
Mark doesn't have a car

00:24:10,838 --> 00:24:14,642
and the carpet fibers
we found on Lori's clothing

00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:17,378
are inconsistent with her Lexus.

00:24:17,444 --> 00:24:21,015
Or, maybe Lori came home,
she and Mark had a fight.

00:24:21,081 --> 00:24:23,751
Maybe she found out
he was fooling around again.

00:24:23,818 --> 00:24:26,120
<i>She takes off, drives around.</i>

00:24:26,187 --> 00:24:27,822
<i>Tire eventually goes flat.</i>

00:24:27,888 --> 00:24:29,323
<i>She pulls over</i>
<i>to the side of the road</i>

00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:31,959
<i>and a stranger comes along</i>
<i>and abducts her.</i>

00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,629
A stranger driving a Bentley?

00:24:35,696 --> 00:24:40,301
Hey, the rich are just
as deviant as the poor.

00:25:02,957 --> 00:25:04,692
Hey, Dawson.

00:25:04,758 --> 00:25:05,726
Yo.

00:25:05,793 --> 00:25:07,027
Any progress
on those bullets?

00:25:07,094 --> 00:25:09,430
Well, the copper jacket came
from your vic's rifle there.

00:25:09,497 --> 00:25:11,332
A .30‐caliber Winchester,

00:25:11,398 --> 00:25:12,500
Model 70.

00:25:12,566 --> 00:25:13,667
What about the fatal bullet?

00:25:13,734 --> 00:25:16,937
That came
from a .357 Magnum revolver.

00:25:17,004 --> 00:25:18,372
A .357?

00:25:18,439 --> 00:25:19,807
Ran the baby
through IBIS

00:25:19,874 --> 00:25:23,511
and get this: the gun
was used in a '98 robbery.

00:25:23,577 --> 00:25:25,713
The suspect was arrested

00:25:25,779 --> 00:25:27,348
but released
on insufficient evidence

00:25:27,414 --> 00:25:29,617
and the gun was returned.

00:25:29,683 --> 00:25:30,500
You got a name for him?

00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,901
Aaron Colite,

00:25:31,968 --> 00:25:33,236
<i>from Henderson.</i>

00:25:33,303 --> 00:25:34,537
BROWN:
<i>Why don't you just stand</i>

00:25:34,604 --> 00:25:36,940
up by the counter, sir?

00:25:37,006 --> 00:25:39,542
Here's your warrant
that we have here

00:25:39,609 --> 00:25:41,811
for your .357
Magnum revolver.

00:25:41,878 --> 00:25:44,280
We know you once used it
in a '98 robbery.

00:25:44,347 --> 00:25:48,051
Serial number ML5684.

00:25:48,117 --> 00:25:49,285
We don't want you to get it.

00:25:49,352 --> 00:25:51,487
Why don't you just point
and show us where it is.

00:25:51,554 --> 00:25:52,889
What's this about?

00:25:52,956 --> 00:25:54,624
Where's the gun, sir?

00:25:57,227 --> 00:25:58,228
Right under the TV.

00:26:07,237 --> 00:26:09,706
Okay, Mr. Colite,

00:26:09,772 --> 00:26:12,275
this gun is going into evidence.

00:26:12,342 --> 00:26:14,377
Look, I was cleared
in that robbery years ago.

00:26:14,444 --> 00:26:16,212
Well, someone killed
a Kodiak bear

00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:18,948
up in the Black Mountains
the day before yesterday.

00:26:19,015 --> 00:26:21,551
You wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

00:26:21,618 --> 00:26:24,120
Yeah, I did. I killed it.

00:26:24,187 --> 00:26:26,389
Excuse me?

00:26:26,456 --> 00:26:28,224
I killed it.

00:26:28,291 --> 00:26:31,661
Look, I was...
I was out hunting.

00:26:31,728 --> 00:26:33,263
MAN:
Help!

00:26:33,329 --> 00:26:34,430
Help me!

00:26:34,497 --> 00:26:35,231
Stop! Help!

00:26:35,298 --> 00:26:36,566
Help me! Help!

00:26:36,633 --> 00:26:38,968
Help!

00:26:40,003 --> 00:26:41,971
By the time
I shot the bear,

00:26:42,038 --> 00:26:44,974
the guy was already dead.

00:26:45,041 --> 00:26:47,911
You mind if I have
a look around?

00:26:47,977 --> 00:26:49,345
Yeah, I do, actually.

00:26:49,412 --> 00:26:51,481
You just admitted
a felony of killing a bear.

00:26:51,548 --> 00:26:52,982
Why didn't you report it?

00:26:53,049 --> 00:26:55,084
I've been
through the wringer

00:26:55,151 --> 00:26:56,586
with you guys once before.

00:26:56,653 --> 00:26:58,054
I figured a guy was dead.

00:26:58,121 --> 00:27:00,290
There was nothing
I could do about it.

00:27:00,356 --> 00:27:03,026
I took off.

00:27:05,028 --> 00:27:06,829
Look, I've got a hunting
license with tags.

00:27:06,896 --> 00:27:07,897
I was out hunting deer.

00:27:07,964 --> 00:27:10,166
Tried to save
a guy's life.

00:27:10,233 --> 00:27:11,167
That's it.

00:27:11,234 --> 00:27:12,068
Whoa, Mr. Colite.

00:27:12,135 --> 00:27:16,272
I just have one
more question for you.

00:27:16,339 --> 00:27:19,676
How long have you
been storing gallbladders

00:27:19,742 --> 00:27:21,177
with your ice cream?

00:27:21,244 --> 00:27:22,946
It ain't illegal
to cut up a dead animal

00:27:23,012 --> 00:27:24,447
as long as it's already dead.
That's the law.

00:27:24,514 --> 00:27:25,582
Could you lift

00:27:25,648 --> 00:27:26,983
your pants leg
for me, please, sir?

00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:28,551
For what?

00:27:28,618 --> 00:27:29,819
Someone snagged
their pant leg

00:27:29,886 --> 00:27:31,855
on a tree, probably
cut themselves.

00:27:31,921 --> 00:27:33,156
I wanted to see if it was you.

00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,829
Take a look.

00:27:39,896 --> 00:27:40,830
Wasn't me.

00:27:42,899 --> 00:27:45,301
So Robbins sent
the bear's blood to Tox.

00:27:45,368 --> 00:27:47,070
It turns out there
were elevated levels

00:27:47,136 --> 00:27:49,305
of Ketamine
in its system.

00:27:49,372 --> 00:27:50,373
Barbiturates?

00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,575
Yeah.

00:27:52,642 --> 00:27:54,811
I think I know what's
going on here, Catherine.

00:27:55,812 --> 00:27:57,680
( <i>gunshot</i> )

00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:02,952
They're called canned hunts.

00:28:03,019 --> 00:28:04,487
Going on all
over the country.

00:28:04,554 --> 00:28:06,155
I'm sorry.

00:28:06,222 --> 00:28:08,024
There's just
no sport in that.

00:28:08,091 --> 00:28:09,058
It's just sick.

00:28:09,125 --> 00:28:09,926
Well, you got that right.

00:28:09,993 --> 00:28:11,761
Point is, you don't
have to go to Africa

00:28:11,828 --> 00:28:12,762
to hunt wild game anymore.

00:28:12,829 --> 00:28:13,563
If you've got the money,

00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:15,532
Africa comes to you.

00:28:15,598 --> 00:28:17,534
And they drug the animals?

00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,502
To guarantee a kill, yeah.

00:28:19,569 --> 00:28:21,037
But in our case,
both the hunter

00:28:21,104 --> 00:28:23,206
and the prey ended up dead.

00:28:23,273 --> 00:28:25,508
Something went wrong.

00:28:25,575 --> 00:28:26,676
( <i>knocks</i> )

00:28:26,743 --> 00:28:29,045
Hey.

00:28:29,112 --> 00:28:30,980
Oh, filling out reports?

00:28:31,047 --> 00:28:33,249
They tell me it's my job.

00:28:34,751 --> 00:28:35,985
You doing okay?

00:28:36,052 --> 00:28:38,955
Yeah.

00:28:39,022 --> 00:28:40,890
Thanks.

00:28:40,957 --> 00:28:43,526
I, uh, did a DMV search.

00:28:43,593 --> 00:28:46,496
There are only five Bentleys
with red interior

00:28:46,563 --> 00:28:47,764
registered in Clark County.

00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:48,898
Two are leased.

00:28:48,965 --> 00:28:50,667
Two are privately owned.

00:28:50,733 --> 00:28:52,335
I ran the ROs.
Nothing suspicious.

00:28:52,402 --> 00:28:53,503
PD is following up.

00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:54,804
What about the fifth one?

00:28:54,871 --> 00:28:56,072
Well, that one

00:28:56,139 --> 00:28:58,274
is owned by a boutique
rental car agency.

00:28:58,341 --> 00:28:59,876
I subpoenaed the rental history.

00:28:59,943 --> 00:29:01,578
Diane Hoyt, Lori's mother,

00:29:01,644 --> 00:29:03,613
had the car for
the last two weeks.

00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:06,683
She returned it
the day after Lori disappeared.

00:29:06,749 --> 00:29:08,618
Where is it now?

00:29:08,685 --> 00:29:11,120
If you've added up every cent
I've made in my entire life,

00:29:11,187 --> 00:29:13,556
I still wouldn't be able
to afford half this car.

00:29:13,623 --> 00:29:14,858
Yeah, but why
would you want it?

00:29:14,924 --> 00:29:16,326
The insurance premiums
are sky‐high.

00:29:16,392 --> 00:29:18,328
Not to mention
theft, scratches.

00:29:18,394 --> 00:29:19,896
It's art.

00:29:19,963 --> 00:29:22,832
And I'd have every girl
in the neighborhood after me.

00:29:22,899 --> 00:29:24,100
Not when they saw
your apartment.

00:29:24,167 --> 00:29:25,635
You've been to
Greg's apartment?

00:29:25,702 --> 00:29:27,270
Who hasn't?

00:29:28,705 --> 00:29:29,939
Red carpet.

00:29:30,006 --> 00:29:31,474
Same as the interior.

00:29:31,541 --> 00:29:33,076
SIDLE:
Recently vacuumed.

00:29:33,142 --> 00:29:35,178
We got better vacuums.

00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:18,354
You found pods

00:30:18,421 --> 00:30:20,056
in the victim's hair, right?

00:30:25,995 --> 00:30:27,964
Same shape, size, color.

00:30:28,031 --> 00:30:29,432
Too bad we can't ID

00:30:29,499 --> 00:30:31,201
this pod and tie it
to that tree.

00:30:31,267 --> 00:30:32,535
Who says we can't?

00:30:32,602 --> 00:30:34,103
Plant DNA is
no different

00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:35,438
than human DNA.

00:30:35,505 --> 00:30:37,674
In fact, a plant genome
is larger.

00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,875
I'm on it.

00:30:38,942 --> 00:30:41,544
If we can prove the pod
came from that dump site,

00:30:41,611 --> 00:30:43,279
you know what that means?

00:30:43,346 --> 00:30:45,782
Lori's mother
is a viable suspect.

00:31:33,875 --> 00:31:36,811
Why are you asking my client
about a rental car?

00:31:36,878 --> 00:31:38,847
It may be probative
to our investigation

00:31:38,913 --> 00:31:40,315
of her daughter's death.

00:31:40,382 --> 00:31:41,850
I'll answer anything they want.

00:31:41,916 --> 00:31:43,518
I backed my car

00:31:43,585 --> 00:31:44,986
into a telephone pole.

00:31:45,053 --> 00:31:46,287
So I put it in the shop.

00:31:46,354 --> 00:31:47,989
I had to rent a car.

00:31:48,056 --> 00:31:49,491
At a grand a day,

00:31:49,557 --> 00:31:50,925
a Bentley's a
little extravagant.

00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:52,427
I mean, I usually
rent a Taurus.

00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:55,397
It's a fantasy car.

00:31:55,463 --> 00:31:58,933
Ever since Amy got hers,
I've wanted one, so I splurged.

00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,935
BRASS:
Was the vehicle ever
out of your possession?

00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:03,004
You mean, did I let
anybody drive it?

00:32:03,071 --> 00:32:04,072
That's what I mean, yeah.

00:32:04,139 --> 00:32:06,908
Lori and Mark both did.

00:32:06,975 --> 00:32:08,543
But I was always with them.

00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:11,680
Ms. Hoyt, did you drive
your car to Sutor, Nevada?

00:32:11,746 --> 00:32:12,947
No.

00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:15,450
Where are you going with this?

00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:16,751
On the hood of
the vehicle,

00:32:16,818 --> 00:32:18,920
which affirmatively
matched the plant material

00:32:18,987 --> 00:32:20,455
we found in Lori's hair.

00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:22,924
All of which came from
the same tree in Sutor.

00:32:22,991 --> 00:32:24,926
Okay, but my client
returned the Bentley

00:32:24,993 --> 00:32:26,261
the day before yesterday.

00:32:26,328 --> 00:32:27,796
It was washed
and then rented again,

00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:30,098
so perhaps that individual
drove through Sutor

00:32:30,165 --> 00:32:31,599
on his or her way
out of town.

00:32:31,666 --> 00:32:33,635
Or, as you know, that "pod"

00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:36,371
could be weeks
or months old.

00:32:36,438 --> 00:32:39,274
We also collected a number of
errant hairs from the vehicle.

00:32:39,341 --> 00:32:40,442
Several are
consistent

00:32:40,508 --> 00:32:41,443
with Mark and
Lori's DNA

00:32:41,509 --> 00:32:44,279
and also Joey's, but not yours.

00:32:44,346 --> 00:32:45,447
Okay, I'm sorry.

00:32:45,513 --> 00:32:47,282
You don't have a DNA sample
of my client's

00:32:47,349 --> 00:32:48,483
for comparison purposes.

00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:50,785
No, but we have her daughter's.

00:32:50,852 --> 00:32:53,421
You're not Lori's
biological mother, are you?

00:32:53,488 --> 00:32:55,657
I'm her stepmom.

00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:57,959
That's not a secret.

00:32:58,026 --> 00:33:00,829
I couldn't have children
of my own.

00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:02,764
Ever since
Lori's father died

00:33:02,831 --> 00:33:06,101
a few months ago,
she's all I had.

00:33:06,167 --> 00:33:08,236
Look, Mark is
devastated.

00:33:08,303 --> 00:33:10,271
I really should get back
to my grandson.

00:33:10,338 --> 00:33:11,806
Before you go, could
we take a DNA sample?

00:33:11,873 --> 00:33:12,941
You do not have
to do that.

00:33:13,008 --> 00:33:15,176
Yeah, but if she
has nothing to hide,
it's no big deal.

00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:16,645
Could you open
your mouth?

00:33:16,711 --> 00:33:17,846
All right,
that's it.

00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:19,114
We're finished here.
Let's go.

00:33:24,486 --> 00:33:25,754
What are you thinking?

00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:27,589
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:33:27,656 --> 00:33:31,059
We have nothing
to arrest her on.

00:33:33,995 --> 00:33:35,667
And we have
unexplained evidence

00:33:35,667 --> 00:33:38,270
placing Lori back at the house
after her night out.

00:33:38,337 --> 00:33:39,605
That's why I
like the husband.

00:33:39,671 --> 00:33:40,939
Maybe they're
in it together.

00:33:41,006 --> 00:33:43,775
Well, when two people
of the opposite sex conspire

00:33:43,842 --> 00:33:45,444
to kill one
of their partners,

00:33:45,511 --> 00:33:48,280
sex or money is
almost always involved.

00:33:48,347 --> 00:33:51,783
Now, Lori's friend, Amy,
did say Mark was a player.

00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:53,619
Hello, Mrs. Robinson.

00:33:53,685 --> 00:33:55,387
I had this boyfriend
back in college,

00:33:55,454 --> 00:33:56,889
and when he got
his first Harley,

00:33:56,955 --> 00:33:59,057
well, let's just say
we sat face‐to‐face

00:33:59,124 --> 00:34:00,225
and went for a ride.

00:34:00,292 --> 00:34:02,394
A Bentley is a lot more
comfortable than a bike.

00:34:02,461 --> 00:34:03,896
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:34:45,671 --> 00:34:47,272
Document was forged

00:34:47,339 --> 00:34:49,107
by taking
an official license

00:34:49,174 --> 00:34:51,276
issued by the
Department of
Agriculture

00:34:51,343 --> 00:34:53,879
and scraping away
the top layer
of information.

00:34:53,946 --> 00:34:57,282
Document was then photocopied,
and the bogus info was typed in.

00:34:57,349 --> 00:34:59,151
Take a look.

00:35:00,185 --> 00:35:01,720
WILLOWS:
Mm‐hmm.

00:35:01,787 --> 00:35:02,921
A simple forgery,

00:35:02,988 --> 00:35:05,457
but it doesn't get us
any closer to our suspect.

00:35:05,524 --> 00:35:06,458
Actually, it does.

00:35:06,525 --> 00:35:08,060
See, a couple years back,

00:35:08,126 --> 00:35:10,929
some photocopier companies
started imbedding their machines

00:35:10,996 --> 00:35:12,898
with serial numbers

00:35:12,965 --> 00:35:15,133
less than a
millimeter in size

00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,870
and visible only
under a blue LED light.

00:35:17,936 --> 00:35:18,937
Of course.

00:35:24,977 --> 00:35:26,278
I see it.

00:35:26,345 --> 00:35:27,579
It's as good as fingerprint.

00:35:28,981 --> 00:35:30,682
Thanks.

00:35:36,522 --> 00:35:38,924
TRACY:
And you think
the broker's documentation

00:35:38,991 --> 00:35:40,592
was forged here
on my copier?

00:35:40,659 --> 00:35:41,760
We know it was.

00:35:41,827 --> 00:35:45,130
Mr. Tracy, tell us
about canned hunts.

00:35:45,197 --> 00:35:48,100
Uh, a wild animal is released
into a controlled area

00:35:48,167 --> 00:35:50,002
where a hunter pays a fee
to kill it.

00:35:50,068 --> 00:35:52,437
The promoters
guarantee a trophy,

00:35:52,504 --> 00:35:53,939
so no kill, no pay.

00:35:54,006 --> 00:35:56,208
They're illegal in Nevada.

00:35:56,275 --> 00:35:57,776
Is that what happened
to my bear?

00:35:57,843 --> 00:35:59,978
Aaron Colite worked here, right?

00:36:01,013 --> 00:36:02,447
Yeah. Maintenance.

00:36:02,514 --> 00:36:03,448
You fired him?

00:36:03,515 --> 00:36:04,950
About six
months ago.

00:36:05,017 --> 00:36:07,319
We let a lot people go.
Cutbacks.

00:36:07,386 --> 00:36:09,555
Well, the evidence places Aaron
at the crime scene.

00:36:09,621 --> 00:36:11,490
Wait, so you're
thinking he forged

00:36:11,557 --> 00:36:12,691
the broker's document

00:36:12,758 --> 00:36:14,827
and took Tippy
under false pretenses?

00:36:14,893 --> 00:36:16,795
BROWN:
No. We spoke to
your distributor.

00:36:16,862 --> 00:36:19,731
Your copy machine was
only installed two months ago.

00:36:19,798 --> 00:36:22,034
We think you created
the false document.

00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,769
We suspect that Aaron

00:36:23,836 --> 00:36:25,737
figured out a way
to make a buck,

00:36:25,804 --> 00:36:27,439
and he asked for your help.

00:36:27,506 --> 00:36:30,008
BROWN:
So Aaron organizes
this canned hunt.

00:36:30,075 --> 00:36:31,743
A few days ago,
you guys meet up

00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:33,712
with Rod Hollis
up at Lake Mead.

00:36:33,779 --> 00:36:35,380
Rod, Rod, Rod, Rod!

00:36:36,515 --> 00:36:37,282
Right there.

00:36:37,349 --> 00:36:38,717
You see him?

00:36:50,929 --> 00:36:51,997
Yes!

00:36:52,064 --> 00:36:52,865
I got him!

00:36:52,931 --> 00:36:54,533
Yep, you got him.

00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,201
Mr. Hollis
probably thought

00:36:56,268 --> 00:36:57,536
that he had killed
the bear,

00:36:57,603 --> 00:37:00,272
and he raced over
to claim his trophy.

00:37:03,075 --> 00:37:03,842
( <i>screaming</i> )

00:37:07,379 --> 00:37:09,248
Help! Help! Help me!

00:37:09,314 --> 00:37:11,517
Help!

00:37:12,518 --> 00:37:14,386
His shot only stunned the bear.

00:37:14,453 --> 00:37:16,355
It was Aaron's shot
that killed it.

00:37:17,389 --> 00:37:19,191
You can't prove I was there.

00:37:19,258 --> 00:37:21,393
Would you lift up
your pants legs, please, sir?

00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,694
What?

00:37:22,761 --> 00:37:24,229
I have the judge on speed dial.

00:37:24,296 --> 00:37:26,064
You want to save me
some time here?

00:37:33,205 --> 00:37:35,607
HOLLIS:
Help! Help! Help me!

00:37:38,343 --> 00:37:39,912
I got this gardening.

00:37:39,978 --> 00:37:40,913
( <i>laughs</i> )

00:37:40,979 --> 00:37:43,849
We subpoenaed
Aaron's bank records.

00:37:43,916 --> 00:37:47,252
Rod Hollis sent Aaron
a check for $16,000.

00:37:47,319 --> 00:37:50,756
Aaron sent you a check
for $8,000.

00:37:50,823 --> 00:37:52,591
That's a 50‐50 split.

00:37:52,658 --> 00:37:53,959
You're looking
at grand larceny

00:37:54,026 --> 00:37:56,829
and obtaining property
under false pretenses.

00:37:58,197 --> 00:37:59,798
That's about 20 years
right there.

00:37:59,865 --> 00:38:02,868
I'm recommending to the DA
that he add another charge:

00:38:02,935 --> 00:38:04,136
second degree murder...

00:38:07,539 --> 00:38:09,141
...for the death of the hunter.

00:38:09,208 --> 00:38:11,376
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:38:12,377 --> 00:38:13,879
We found
your client's semen mixed

00:38:13,946 --> 00:38:16,548
with a vaginal contribution
from Diane Hoyt

00:38:16,615 --> 00:38:18,717
in the back
of her rental car.

00:38:18,784 --> 00:38:21,053
You said you had nothing
to do with Lori's murder.

00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:22,821
Would you like to revise
that statement?

00:38:22,888 --> 00:38:24,890
No.

00:38:24,957 --> 00:38:28,393
I met Diane, uh,
two weeks ago at Rain.

00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:30,095
Banged the cougar
that night,

00:38:30,162 --> 00:38:33,065
but I had no idea she
was anybody's mother.

00:38:33,131 --> 00:38:35,067
So you haven't spoken
to her since?

00:38:35,133 --> 00:38:37,236
Well, that's the whole point
of banging a cougar‐‐

00:38:37,302 --> 00:38:38,737
you never got
to see 'em again.

00:38:38,804 --> 00:38:39,972
One lie after another.

00:38:40,038 --> 00:38:43,175
Are you questioning
my client's veracity?

00:38:43,242 --> 00:38:45,611
These are your client's
cell phone records.

00:38:45,677 --> 00:38:46,612
Semen in the car

00:38:46,678 --> 00:38:47,913
was enough to get
a warrant.

00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:48,981
On the night
that Lori

00:38:49,047 --> 00:38:51,850
was murdered, he called Ms. Hoyt
on her cell phone

00:38:51,917 --> 00:38:54,419
<i>at 11:23 p. m.</i>

00:38:54,486 --> 00:38:56,255
No, I don't know him.

00:38:57,756 --> 00:38:59,825
You've never seen
or spoken to this man?

00:38:59,892 --> 00:39:01,693
No, not that I remember.

00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,862
CURTIS:
Hmm.

00:39:03,929 --> 00:39:06,365
Do you remember the men
you have sex with?

00:39:06,431 --> 00:39:07,866
Ms. Curtis, that
is uncalled for.

00:39:07,933 --> 00:39:09,268
SIDLE:
<i>Here's the deal.</i>

00:39:09,334 --> 00:39:11,036
Lori left the club around 11:00.

00:39:11,103 --> 00:39:13,539
By your client's own admission,

00:39:13,605 --> 00:39:15,207
he followed her
for about 20 minutes,

00:39:15,274 --> 00:39:16,708
waiting for the tire to go flat.

00:39:16,775 --> 00:39:19,978
When it didn't,
you called her mother.

00:39:20,045 --> 00:39:21,213
It was all a setup.

00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,048
Brad was going to strike up
a conversation

00:39:23,115 --> 00:39:24,116
with Lori at the club,

00:39:24,183 --> 00:39:26,652
and on her way
home, abduct her.

00:39:26,718 --> 00:39:31,089
And then, one or both of you
were going to kill her.

00:39:34,793 --> 00:39:38,630
But when you got his call...
you went to Plan B.

00:39:38,697 --> 00:39:42,734
I left Lori's house,
drove home and went to bed.

00:39:42,801 --> 00:39:44,036
You never left.

00:39:44,102 --> 00:39:45,571
Mark fell asleep
in the living room,

00:39:45,637 --> 00:39:48,640
and you waited for Lori
to come home.

00:39:54,413 --> 00:39:57,449
( <i>gagging</i> )

00:39:57,516 --> 00:40:00,118
Lori's body was too
heavy for you to carry,

00:40:00,185 --> 00:40:02,921
so you called for help...

00:40:02,988 --> 00:40:04,890
on Mark and Lori's phone.

00:40:04,957 --> 00:40:06,325
<i>You got her call</i>

00:40:06,391 --> 00:40:08,594
at 1:17 a. m.

00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:09,928
Coroner puts Lori's death

00:40:09,995 --> 00:40:12,397
at some time
between 12:00 and 1:00 a. m.

00:40:12,464 --> 00:40:14,533
Well, which means I didn't
kill her, like I told you.

00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,901
Brad, be quiet.

00:40:15,968 --> 00:40:17,269
Oh, I never thought
you did kill her,

00:40:17,336 --> 00:40:18,670
but you did help
get rid of the body,

00:40:18,737 --> 00:40:20,339
and that is conspiracy

00:40:20,405 --> 00:40:21,907
after the fact.

00:40:21,974 --> 00:40:23,609
Now, Mark would've
heard something,

00:40:23,675 --> 00:40:26,245
and if he's
claiming he didn't,

00:40:26,311 --> 00:40:27,880
I'd be looking at him.
The living room's

00:40:27,946 --> 00:40:29,047
at the other end
of the house.

00:40:29,114 --> 00:40:30,048
He was asleep.

00:40:30,115 --> 00:40:31,950
Prove it.

00:40:32,017 --> 00:40:33,619
I don't need to.

00:40:33,685 --> 00:40:35,020
We found something of Lori's

00:40:35,087 --> 00:40:37,422
on the rental
exhaust pipe:

00:40:37,489 --> 00:40:38,490
her skin.

00:40:47,633 --> 00:40:48,967
Your client's on record.

00:40:49,034 --> 00:40:51,403
The vehicle was
never out of her possession.

00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:53,872
SIDLE:
<i>You drove back to the house,</i>

00:40:53,939 --> 00:40:55,240
picked up Lori's Lexus,

00:40:55,307 --> 00:40:57,075
drove back into town.

00:40:57,142 --> 00:40:59,411
Tire went flat
off Boulder Highway.

00:40:59,478 --> 00:41:01,280
You can't prove that.

00:41:01,346 --> 00:41:02,915
When we suspected
Brad's involvement,

00:41:02,981 --> 00:41:04,883
we printed the interior
of the Lexus.

00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:06,585
Your prints are
on the steering wheel.

00:41:11,557 --> 00:41:13,959
Is there a deal to be made?

00:41:14,026 --> 00:41:17,563
Why did Diane Hoyt want
Lori dead?

00:41:17,629 --> 00:41:19,998
I don't know.

00:41:21,834 --> 00:41:24,269
The lady paid me 2,000 bucks.

00:41:24,336 --> 00:41:26,772
Um... said she was having
a fight with her daughter

00:41:26,839 --> 00:41:28,774
and wanted to make good...

00:41:28,841 --> 00:41:30,943
um, only Lori wouldn't return
her calls,

00:41:31,009 --> 00:41:32,945
so it was my job
to get 'em together.

00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,616
When she called me and asked me
for my help later that night,

00:41:37,683 --> 00:41:39,518
she said she'd pay me
$2,000 more.

00:41:44,356 --> 00:41:46,291
I know why she did it.

00:41:46,358 --> 00:41:49,294
While you two were at PD,
I called the family lawyer.

00:41:49,361 --> 00:41:51,964
He faxed over a copy
of Lori's father's trust.

00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:54,566
Estate's worth
$50 million.

00:41:54,633 --> 00:41:56,235
He left it all to Lori?

00:41:56,301 --> 00:41:57,736
No, to her son.

00:41:57,803 --> 00:42:01,073
Lori was the trustee with
a stipend of $2.5 mil a year.

00:42:01,139 --> 00:42:02,908
If anything were to happen
to Lori,

00:42:02,975 --> 00:42:04,910
guess who takes her place?

00:42:04,977 --> 00:42:06,245
Her stepmom.

00:42:06,311 --> 00:42:07,579
Yup.

00:42:07,646 --> 00:42:09,081
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:42:09,148 --> 00:42:12,818
Listen, you guys,
I'll catch up later.

00:42:14,153 --> 00:42:18,323
Hmm. She's fitting in
pretty well, huh?

00:42:25,998 --> 00:42:29,101
You got a minute?

00:42:29,168 --> 00:42:31,336
Sure.

00:42:33,005 --> 00:42:36,608
You did a nice job
on the case.

00:42:36,675 --> 00:42:37,943
I, uh...

00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:39,778
( <i>clears throat</i> ):
I just wanted
you to know

00:42:39,845 --> 00:42:42,247
that I've enjoyed
working with you.

00:42:45,017 --> 00:42:47,920
Well, I've enjoyed working
with you as well.

00:42:47,986 --> 00:42:51,123
No, it's time I made a change.

00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:54,193
I don't like the direction
the lab's headed.

00:42:56,628 --> 00:42:57,729
You mean Ecklie?

00:42:57,796 --> 00:43:00,232
You can't pay any attention
to him.

00:43:00,299 --> 00:43:03,068
No, you got a good team,
but I was a supervisor.

00:43:03,135 --> 00:43:04,736
My demotion was undeserved,

00:43:04,803 --> 00:43:06,772
and every day I'm here,
I'm reminded of that.

00:43:10,776 --> 00:43:12,311
What?

00:43:13,645 --> 00:43:18,083
Well, someone once said,
"What we are never changes,

00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:22,821
but who we are...
never stops changing."

00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:27,125
Let's have dinner, shall we?
