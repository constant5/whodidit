For what it's worth,
nicely manicured nails

which has a groove worn in it.

he continued to breathe a while.

00:09:14,022 --> 00:09:16,959

You didn't touch my camera,
did you?

00:10:51,653 --> 00:10:53,288
No.

00:10:53,355 --> 00:10:56,058
I have a 256 memory card.
This is a 32.

00:10:57,459 --> 00:10:59,595
Somebody switched it out
and took my crime scene photos.

00:10:59,661 --> 00:11:00,596
What?

00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,959
<i>Am I being strong-armed</i>
<i>by private counsel?</i>

00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:11,443
Because, contrary
to what you may think,

00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:14,013
not everybody in Vegas is
under the thumb of Bruce Eiger.

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:14,834
Captain Brass,

00:11:14,834 --> 00:11:16,403
I am simply here
representing the interests

00:11:16,469 --> 00:11:17,837
of Mr. Eiger's estate.

00:11:17,904 --> 00:11:19,239
And those interests
would be what?

00:11:19,306 --> 00:11:21,141
Well, finding out
what happened, certainly.

00:11:21,207 --> 00:11:22,842
But doing everything
within our power

00:11:22,909 --> 00:11:24,511
to protect Mr. Eiger's
private life.

00:11:24,577 --> 00:11:26,112
Protect what?
The guy's dead.

00:11:26,179 --> 00:11:29,182
Mr. Eiger was
a very private person.

00:11:29,249 --> 00:11:31,217
And although he's no longer
with us, his intimates are.

00:11:31,284 --> 00:11:32,419
Look, if this is

00:11:32,485 --> 00:11:34,721
about him being a sodomite,
we already know that.

00:11:34,788 --> 00:11:36,289
Excuse me?

00:11:36,356 --> 00:11:37,557
After the case is adjudicated,

00:11:37,624 --> 00:11:39,392
you can have access
to the autopsy reports.

00:11:39,459 --> 00:11:43,029
In the meantime,
let me do my job, okay?

00:11:43,096 --> 00:11:44,531
When Eiger was
looking into buying

00:11:44,597 --> 00:11:46,700
the Queen Regent Casino
out from under Sy Magli,

00:11:46,766 --> 00:11:48,535
the gaming commission
turned him down.

00:11:48,601 --> 00:11:50,470
So he invited some
of the commissioners

00:11:50,537 --> 00:11:52,105
over to his mansion
for a party.

00:11:52,172 --> 00:11:55,508
A week later, he
had his gaming and
his liquor licenses.

00:11:55,575 --> 00:11:57,110
Must've been
a hell of a party.

00:11:57,177 --> 00:11:59,646
Well, if the Wizard of Oz
had nude photos

00:11:59,713 --> 00:12:00,947
of the Wicked Witch,

00:12:01,014 --> 00:12:02,582
Dorothy would have
never lost her slippers.

00:12:02,649 --> 00:12:05,151
Well, if those files
exist, it gives us
a list of suspects,

00:12:05,218 --> 00:12:07,554
but nobody actually knows
if he has dirt on everyone,

00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,422
or just wants them
to think he does.

00:12:09,489 --> 00:12:11,057
Brass subpoenaed Eiger's
home phone records

00:12:11,124 --> 00:12:12,225
in the last year.

00:12:12,292 --> 00:12:13,526
Yeah, anything interesting?

00:12:13,593 --> 00:12:16,863
Numerous calls from Eiger's
house to Sy Magli's office.

00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:18,765
Well, they were
known business rivals.

00:12:18,832 --> 00:12:20,400
Between midnight
and 4:00 a.m.--

00:12:20,467 --> 00:12:22,135
what I like to call
"love hours."

00:12:22,202 --> 00:12:25,038
Wouldn't be the first time
that hate mutated into passion.

00:12:25,105 --> 00:12:27,574
Public enemies,
private lovers.

00:12:27,641 --> 00:12:29,209
So Jackie Collins.

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,750
MAN:
Tanya, get your sweet little ass
back over to the piano,

00:12:36,816 --> 00:12:38,418
and we'll talk about it later.

00:12:42,756 --> 00:12:44,958
BRASS:
Mr. Magli,

00:12:45,025 --> 00:12:47,794
Detective Jim Brass,
Las Vegas Police.

00:12:47,861 --> 00:12:48,962
Greg Sanders from the crime lab.

00:12:49,029 --> 00:12:49,996
Let me guess.

00:12:50,063 --> 00:12:52,499
You want to talk
to me about Bruce.

00:12:52,565 --> 00:12:54,167
I hear they're using
all the backhoes in hell

00:12:54,234 --> 00:12:55,969
to dig him a new pit.

00:12:56,036 --> 00:12:58,672
We're, uh, focusing on his life
here on Earth.

00:12:58,738 --> 00:12:59,839
Well, you know,

00:12:59,906 --> 00:13:01,875
I thought that bastard
would outlive us all.

00:13:01,941 --> 00:13:03,643
When was the last time
you saw him?

00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:04,711
At his birthday party.

00:13:04,778 --> 00:13:06,446
( <i>Tanya singing</i>

00:13:06,513 --> 00:13:09,316

Bruce didn't have any friends,

00:13:16,723 --> 00:13:18,358
so he had to invite
his enemies,

00:13:18,425 --> 00:13:20,694
a real "who's who"
of Las Vegas.

00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,229
See, Bruce was a shark
who circled around

00:13:23,296 --> 00:13:24,965
for information.

00:13:25,031 --> 00:13:26,833
And when he found your weakness,

00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,802
he filed it away
to be used later.

00:13:28,868 --> 00:13:29,836
His phone records indicate

00:13:29,903 --> 00:13:31,404
that you spoke
more recently than that.

00:13:31,471 --> 00:13:34,641
Oh... so now you
found <i>my</i> weakness.

00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:35,642
What's that?

00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,812
I was banging his wife.

00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:44,451
We have a problem.

00:13:44,517 --> 00:13:46,686
Oh, no, not again.

00:13:46,753 --> 00:13:48,755
The memory card from my
digital camera was stolen

00:13:48,822 --> 00:13:50,590
and switched with a blank.

00:13:50,657 --> 00:13:51,758
The only time the camera

00:13:51,825 --> 00:13:53,860
was out of my possession
was at the crime scene.

00:13:53,927 --> 00:13:55,028
Well, how can that be?

00:13:55,095 --> 00:13:56,196
It was a secure scene.

00:13:56,262 --> 00:13:58,798
I don't know. I dusted
the camera and the card.

00:13:58,865 --> 00:14:00,300
There weren't any prints.

00:14:01,568 --> 00:14:02,702
All of the crime scene photos

00:14:02,769 --> 00:14:05,105
of the body and the blood
evidence were on that card.

00:14:05,171 --> 00:14:06,439
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:14:06,506 --> 00:14:08,008
We do have a problem.

00:14:08,074 --> 00:14:10,710
Yes, we do.

00:14:10,777 --> 00:14:12,746
Get back to the crime scene,
Catherine. Get what you can.

00:14:12,812 --> 00:14:13,880
Well, I know that

00:14:13,947 --> 00:14:15,048
the scene's been released.

00:14:15,115 --> 00:14:16,182
Well, go quickly.

00:14:16,249 --> 00:14:16,750
Okay.

00:14:19,486 --> 00:14:20,687
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:14:20,754 --> 00:14:22,889
Ready?

00:14:22,956 --> 00:14:25,925
The baddest ass in Vegas
had diaper rash.

00:14:25,992 --> 00:14:27,994
The sample that
Doc Robbins collected

00:14:28,061 --> 00:14:31,264
from between his legs
at autopsy: Brenner's Ointment,

00:14:31,331 --> 00:14:33,300
used expressly for that purpose.

00:14:33,366 --> 00:14:34,501
Okay. What about
the handprints

00:14:34,567 --> 00:14:36,069
from the railing and
the floor in study?

00:14:36,136 --> 00:14:37,637
Same deal.

00:14:37,704 --> 00:14:39,306
I compared the hand size,

00:14:39,372 --> 00:14:41,274
and, uh, the prints
aren't Eiger's, man.

00:14:41,341 --> 00:14:41,975
Hmm?

00:14:42,042 --> 00:14:43,943
No. Which means that...

00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:46,012
You couldn't pay me enough
to rub ointment

00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:47,480
on some old guy's butt rash.

00:14:47,547 --> 00:14:48,515
( <i>laughs</i> )

00:14:48,581 --> 00:14:50,383
Well, maybe some people
aren't as discerning

00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:52,252
as you are.

00:14:52,319 --> 00:14:54,387
How does a grown man
get diaper rash?

00:14:54,454 --> 00:14:55,889
I'll take incontinence
for $200, Alex.

00:14:55,955 --> 00:14:56,990
Maybe he had

00:14:57,057 --> 00:14:58,591
gastrointestinal issues.

00:14:58,658 --> 00:15:00,994
And the stomach contents.
All milk.

00:15:01,061 --> 00:15:02,295
You get any tox back?

00:15:02,362 --> 00:15:04,130
Yeah. No drugs
in his bloodstream.

00:15:04,197 --> 00:15:05,598
Really?
He had dilated pupils,

00:15:05,665 --> 00:15:08,068
and he was a sick guy,

00:15:08,134 --> 00:15:10,403
but... no medications.

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,508
Mrs. Eiger!

00:15:15,575 --> 00:15:17,010
Mrs. Eiger,

00:15:17,077 --> 00:15:18,345
please stop.

00:15:18,411 --> 00:15:21,214
Please stop? What, am I supposed
to look at his blood?

00:15:21,281 --> 00:15:22,282
Do I need this?

00:15:22,349 --> 00:15:23,817
( <i>phone ringing</i> )
I need to take

00:15:23,883 --> 00:15:25,485
additional photos
of the crime scene.

00:15:25,552 --> 00:15:27,520
if you could just
put the hose aside and...

00:15:28,555 --> 00:15:30,490
Yeah.

00:15:32,525 --> 00:15:34,260
Oh, Sy.

00:15:34,327 --> 00:15:35,962
You know what? Don't bother.

00:15:36,029 --> 00:15:38,365
You don't have to lie to me.
I get it.

00:15:38,431 --> 00:15:39,799
I really, I really do.

00:15:39,866 --> 00:15:41,001
No, he's dead
and you're leaving.

00:15:41,067 --> 00:15:43,970
Yeah, well, maybe
I just thought

00:15:44,037 --> 00:15:46,573
that I was more
than just a hate lay.

00:15:47,774 --> 00:15:49,009
Uh, men just don't

00:15:49,075 --> 00:15:50,977
appreciate us.

00:15:51,044 --> 00:15:52,278
DONNA:
It's never enough.

00:15:52,345 --> 00:15:54,514
When you put up with things
that nobody else would

00:15:54,581 --> 00:15:56,182
and he stills wants more.

00:15:56,249 --> 00:15:58,718
I mean, just how low
are we supposed to sink?

00:15:58,785 --> 00:16:01,221
You know, I think you're
better off without him, anyway.

00:16:01,287 --> 00:16:02,956
What's your name?

00:16:03,023 --> 00:16:04,057
Catherine.

00:16:04,124 --> 00:16:05,925
You know, Catherine,
this whole, um,

00:16:05,992 --> 00:16:08,161
sisterhood thing that you're
trying to get going here,

00:16:08,228 --> 00:16:09,729
it's just really not
working for me.

Sara and Greg went through
these cans last night.

00:16:36,556 --> 00:16:37,557
They were empty.

00:16:37,624 --> 00:16:39,092
WARRICK:
Well, it looks like

00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:40,493
Mrs. Eiger's been
a little busy.

00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,196
Evidently.

00:16:49,936 --> 00:16:52,505
Uh, Warrick?

00:16:52,572 --> 00:16:53,673
Yeah.

00:16:56,876 --> 00:16:58,845
Is that a diaper?

00:16:58,912 --> 00:16:59,913
Mm-hmm.

00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,781
Those safety pins,

00:17:01,848 --> 00:17:03,116
they could match the bruises

00:17:03,183 --> 00:17:04,818
that we found
on Mr. Eiger's hips.

00:17:07,921 --> 00:17:10,056
Well, we can probably
get DNA from the blood.

00:17:10,123 --> 00:17:14,127
But to confirm that Eiger
actually wore this thing,

00:17:14,194 --> 00:17:16,496
Mia's going to have
to test the urine inside.

00:17:16,563 --> 00:17:17,897
Lucky girl.

00:17:17,964 --> 00:17:19,299
Lucky her.

00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:34,414
Do you think Donna

00:17:34,481 --> 00:17:37,117
always takes her laundry
to the city dump?

00:17:37,183 --> 00:17:38,652
I've got handprints
in carpet.

00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,789
He wasn't just incontinent,
he's was a...

Look at these indentations.

00:17:52,966 --> 00:17:54,734
I think they could have been
a desk or something.

00:17:54,801 --> 00:17:57,170
Were gonna have to take this
back to the house

00:17:57,237 --> 00:17:59,239
and look at it
in its original context.

00:17:59,306 --> 00:18:01,308
Is that even legal?
Why are they...

00:18:04,044 --> 00:18:05,478
Why are you
guys doing this?

00:18:05,545 --> 00:18:07,180
Hasn't she been
through enough?

00:18:07,247 --> 00:18:09,349
You know, you should
sue the city.

00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:13,453
She's gonna sue you people!
How about that?

00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,922
GRISSOM:
How do you explain a handprint

00:18:15,989 --> 00:18:18,758
half covered by a wall?

00:18:18,825 --> 00:18:21,094
I mean, we're not even certain
this rug came from this room.

00:18:21,161 --> 00:18:22,462
Well, I was gonna say
the same thing,

00:18:22,529 --> 00:18:23,530
but the rug has eight divots

00:18:23,596 --> 00:18:26,499
that line up perfectly
with that desk.

00:18:26,566 --> 00:18:28,702
Think outside the rug.

00:18:30,437 --> 00:18:34,140
A man with secrets
needs a place to hide them.

out of here.

with a secret this big?

00:19:49,043 --> 00:19:51,145
It'd probably kill him
if anyone found out.

00:19:51,212 --> 00:19:52,880
I think it did kill him.

00:19:52,947 --> 00:19:54,282

to suicide?

theorize later.

Who's your mommy?

00:20:03,124 --> 00:20:05,893

I think that

00:20:21,409 --> 00:20:24,478
Bruce just wanted the same thing
as every other guy.

the repeated insertions.

I think this was originally used
as a panic room.

Where would you buy
something like this?

Oh, hey.

00:22:01,309 --> 00:22:02,543
You asked me

00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:04,912
to check the blood and
urine from the diaper.

00:22:04,979 --> 00:22:05,913
Yeah.

00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,014
Yeah, the blood
is a match

00:22:07,081 --> 00:22:08,482
for Eiger, and the urine

00:22:08,549 --> 00:22:10,451
had high levels of testosterone,

00:22:10,518 --> 00:22:12,420
which is indicative of an adult.

00:22:12,487 --> 00:22:14,789
It's a safe assumption
that it's his.
Yeah.

00:22:14,856 --> 00:22:16,157
You know, one other thing.

00:22:16,224 --> 00:22:17,692
When I was running the urine,

00:22:17,758 --> 00:22:20,127
I found another spike
that I couldn't identify.

00:22:20,194 --> 00:22:21,362
So I sent it on to Tox.

00:22:21,429 --> 00:22:23,130
Well, I know that his blood work
came back clean.

00:22:23,197 --> 00:22:24,432
Some drugs metabolize quickly,

00:22:24,499 --> 00:22:26,634
so what doesn't show up in the
blood, shows up in the urine.

According to Mrs. Eiger's
verified alibi,

00:28:47,682 --> 00:28:50,418
she left for the club
around 7:15.

00:28:50,485 --> 00:28:52,153
Okay.

00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:55,289
Garage door opens,
7:18. Got it.

00:28:55,356 --> 00:28:57,892
Dispatch received
her 911 call at 11:42.

00:28:57,959 --> 00:29:01,162
So we're concerned
with the four hours in between.

00:29:01,229 --> 00:29:02,697
8:00, the front door opens.

00:29:02,763 --> 00:29:04,298
It was probably the milkmaid.

00:29:04,365 --> 00:29:07,168
10:09, the third floor
balcony doors were opened.

00:29:08,803 --> 00:29:10,338
Bye-bye, Bruce.

00:29:10,404 --> 00:29:13,341
Now four minutes later,
the front door opens again.

00:29:13,407 --> 00:29:16,110
Milkmaid exits?

00:29:19,547 --> 00:29:22,150
17 minutes later, at 10:30,
the garage door opens.

00:29:22,216 --> 00:29:24,785
I guess that was Mrs. Eiger.

00:29:26,554 --> 00:29:30,358
But then a minute later,
at 10:31,

00:29:30,424 --> 00:29:32,660
the front door opens again.

00:29:32,727 --> 00:29:36,063
She didn't make her call to 911
until 11:42.

00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:38,566
What was she doing
for over an hour?

00:29:42,803 --> 00:29:45,173
Count Basie said

00:29:45,239 --> 00:29:48,743
that it's the notes
you don't hear that matter.

00:29:49,777 --> 00:29:52,813
Two voids...

00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,081
one pointing towards 11:00,

00:29:54,148 --> 00:29:55,917
one towards

00:29:55,983 --> 00:29:57,351
1:00.

00:29:57,418 --> 00:29:58,920
Something blocked the spray.

00:29:58,986 --> 00:30:01,189
Something in a size eight.

00:30:04,058 --> 00:30:07,328
Could that be explained
by her rendering aid?

00:30:07,395 --> 00:30:09,063
I don't think so.

00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:10,865
It's a fine mist.

00:30:10,932 --> 00:30:12,767
Spatter.

00:30:15,436 --> 00:30:19,040
I think he was still alive,
expirating blood.

00:30:19,106 --> 00:30:21,342
( <i>gurgled choking</i> )

00:30:21,409 --> 00:30:23,444
I wonder
what was going through her mind

00:30:23,511 --> 00:30:25,613
when she stood there
and watched him die?

00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:28,082
I wonder
what was going through his?

00:30:33,166 --> 00:30:35,769
Fine.

00:30:35,835 --> 00:30:39,306
I was, uh, playing canasta
at the club,

00:30:39,372 --> 00:30:42,108
like I do
every Thursday night.

00:30:42,175 --> 00:30:43,610
I come home.

00:30:43,677 --> 00:30:47,380
I pull into the driveway,
and-and there he was.

00:30:50,216 --> 00:30:51,851
You administer any help?

00:30:51,918 --> 00:30:55,322
Uh, more like encouragement.

00:30:59,526 --> 00:31:00,894
DONNA:
<i>Oh, dear.</i>

00:31:00,961 --> 00:31:02,529
<i>What happened</i>
<i>to Mummy's widdle baby?</i>

00:31:02,595 --> 00:31:05,565
Did Brucey fall down
and go boom?

00:31:05,632 --> 00:31:06,900
So you're admitting
responsibility

00:31:06,967 --> 00:31:08,134
in the death of your husband?

00:31:08,201 --> 00:31:09,602
MAN:
No.

00:31:09,669 --> 00:31:11,404
Mrs. Eiger is not a
health care professional.

00:31:11,471 --> 00:31:13,440
She merely delayed
in calling for help.

00:31:13,506 --> 00:31:15,208
She watched him die.

00:31:15,275 --> 00:31:16,409
His had a broken neck.

00:31:16,476 --> 00:31:18,778
If he'd lived,
he would've been a quadriplegic.

00:31:18,845 --> 00:31:20,714
So it was a mercy killing?

00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:21,982
It wasn't a killing at all.

00:31:24,451 --> 00:31:28,088
You would've
had to take care of him.

00:31:28,688 --> 00:31:29,889
Oh, bathe him,

00:31:29,956 --> 00:31:32,559
feed him, change his diapers.

00:31:32,625 --> 00:31:34,094
( <i>Donna chuckles</i> )

00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,795
Freakin' gift from God to him.

00:31:35,862 --> 00:31:37,931
See the thing was,
I-I just didn't want

00:31:37,998 --> 00:31:39,833
Bruce to have the satisfaction

00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:42,268
of being helpless
for the rest of his life.

00:31:42,335 --> 00:31:44,437
Do you know
what the last words

00:31:44,504 --> 00:31:45,972
I said to him were?

00:31:47,307 --> 00:31:49,342
You lose.

00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:53,847
So I take it that you weren't
his, uh, his mommy?

00:31:53,913 --> 00:31:56,049
Look-- love, honor, cherish.

00:31:56,116 --> 00:31:58,852
Diapering was never on the list.

00:31:58,918 --> 00:32:00,654
How'd you deal with it?

00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,055
Oh, I didn't.

00:32:02,122 --> 00:32:04,891
Look, I'm sorry, but...

00:32:04,958 --> 00:32:08,628
you can't have sex with a man
after you've seen him...

00:32:08,695 --> 00:32:13,199
after you've seen him
behave like that.

00:32:14,234 --> 00:32:16,636
So in order
to save our marriage,

00:32:16,703 --> 00:32:19,606
we had, uh, an arrangement.

00:32:19,673 --> 00:32:21,274
On Thursday nights,

00:32:21,341 --> 00:32:24,244
I go to the club
with my friends.

00:32:24,311 --> 00:32:26,546
He hires a baby-sitter.

00:32:26,613 --> 00:32:28,915
We have reason to believe it was
the same baby-sitter every week.

00:32:28,982 --> 00:32:30,083
Any idea who that is?

00:32:32,118 --> 00:32:33,386
No, women in my position

00:32:33,453 --> 00:32:35,755
have been looking
the other way for years.

00:32:35,822 --> 00:32:41,027
I just had... something a little
stranger to look away from.

00:32:41,094 --> 00:32:42,395
Why didn't you leave him?

00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:46,166
Nobody leaves Bruce.

00:32:46,232 --> 00:32:48,969
Well, maybe you had to
get Bruce to leave you.

00:32:49,035 --> 00:32:50,570
You push him off the balcony?

00:32:50,637 --> 00:32:52,138
No.

00:32:52,205 --> 00:32:54,674
He'd already fallen
when I found him.

00:32:54,741 --> 00:32:56,710
I turned him over.

00:32:56,776 --> 00:32:58,111
I watched him die.

00:32:58,178 --> 00:33:01,214
<i>I got rid of the diaper.</i>

00:33:01,281 --> 00:33:02,315
<i>I rolled up the carpet.</i>

00:33:02,382 --> 00:33:05,518
<i>I changed my clothes.</i>

00:33:05,585 --> 00:33:06,720
Then I called 911.

00:33:06,786 --> 00:33:09,389
And I should've left him
in the damn diaper.

00:33:09,456 --> 00:33:11,491
I don't know
what I was protecting.

00:33:11,558 --> 00:33:14,227
Your reputation.

00:33:14,294 --> 00:33:16,062
Donna may be
an opportunist,

00:33:16,129 --> 00:33:17,731
but she is not a murderer.

00:33:17,797 --> 00:33:20,567
And since neither of us believe
that Bruce was suicidal...

00:33:20,634 --> 00:33:23,069
You're both psychiatrists?

00:33:23,136 --> 00:33:24,671
Look, my husband
did not commit suicide.

00:33:24,738 --> 00:33:26,406
So why don't you just
find the guy who did,

00:33:26,473 --> 00:33:28,508
and I will write him
a big, fat check.

00:33:28,575 --> 00:33:30,577
WILLOWS:
<i>That drug spike</i>

00:33:30,644 --> 00:33:32,646
that Mia detected
in Bruce's diaper--

00:33:32,712 --> 00:33:37,450
"Lucy in the sky
with diamonds..." LSD.

00:33:37,517 --> 00:33:39,552
But I don't get it,
because acid trips
last for hours.

00:33:39,619 --> 00:33:41,488
Why wouldn't it
have shown up in
his bloodstream?

00:33:41,554 --> 00:33:44,391
LSD is in and out
of your system in 20 minutes.

00:33:44,457 --> 00:33:45,525
But it acts as a trigger,

00:33:45,592 --> 00:33:47,761
which sets off cascading
reactions in the brain.

00:33:49,963 --> 00:33:52,899
<i>The brain keeps cascading</i>
<i>long after the drug is gone.</i>

00:33:52,966 --> 00:33:55,535
Well, there are good
trips, and bad trips,

00:33:55,602 --> 00:33:57,537
and trips right
off the balcony.

00:33:57,604 --> 00:34:00,507
Strange drug of choice
for a control freak.

00:34:00,573 --> 00:34:02,042
Maybe not his choice.

00:34:02,108 --> 00:34:05,679
So we're looking for
a lactating female

00:34:05,745 --> 00:34:08,081
with a center
whorl print.

00:34:08,148 --> 00:34:10,083
We recovered
two sets of prints

00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,918
from the baby
paraphernalia.

00:34:11,985 --> 00:34:12,986
His and...

00:34:13,053 --> 00:34:14,321
presumably hers.

00:34:14,387 --> 00:34:16,456
We've excluded
Mrs. Eiger.

00:34:16,523 --> 00:34:19,826
How long can a woman lactate
after giving birth?

00:34:19,893 --> 00:34:21,528
I had a professor in college,

00:34:21,594 --> 00:34:23,997
her six-year-old
used to come in for lunch.

00:34:24,064 --> 00:34:25,799
I guess they'll go

00:34:25,865 --> 00:34:27,233
as long as you let them.

00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,302
What, the boobs or the kids?

00:34:29,369 --> 00:34:33,173
That's a two-legged
topless buffet.

00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,607
I'm thinking, you know,

00:34:34,674 --> 00:34:37,577
if you commit to something
every Thursday night,

00:34:37,644 --> 00:34:38,912
you got to be getting

00:34:38,979 --> 00:34:40,213
something good
out of it.

00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,082
We found oil drops
on the driveway.

00:34:42,148 --> 00:34:43,850
None of the Eiger
cars had leaks.

00:34:43,917 --> 00:34:46,686
I ran it through Trace.

00:34:46,753 --> 00:34:49,789
It was an Agip... Sint 2000.

00:34:49,856 --> 00:34:51,057
It's a synthetic
motor oil.

00:34:51,124 --> 00:34:52,759
A synthetic would
make it high end.

00:34:52,826 --> 00:34:53,760
That particular

00:34:53,827 --> 00:34:55,762
oil is only used
for Lamborghinis.

00:34:55,829 --> 00:34:58,698
How many lactating women
are driving one of those?

00:34:58,765 --> 00:35:01,534
So he either paid well
or was a good gift giver.

00:35:01,601 --> 00:35:03,203
Maybe we're looking
for a cash cow.

00:35:03,269 --> 00:35:04,904
With liquid assets.

00:35:06,606 --> 00:35:07,741
I had the distinct pleasure

00:35:07,807 --> 00:35:10,176
of testing all the modes of
ingestion from the nursery.

00:35:10,243 --> 00:35:12,312
Most people take acid
on their tongue.

00:35:12,379 --> 00:35:13,313
Bruce...

00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,948
An enema.

00:35:15,015 --> 00:35:16,850
And people call me anal.

00:35:16,916 --> 00:35:18,218
Well, the whole point
of having a "mommy"

00:35:18,284 --> 00:35:19,552
is to have her do
these things for you.

00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:20,820
WILLOWS:
So the acid was

00:35:20,887 --> 00:35:23,423
no doubt supplied
by the same sweet thing

00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:25,025
who gave him breast milk

00:35:25,091 --> 00:35:26,326
from that...

00:35:26,393 --> 00:35:29,062
boobs-ahoy dress.

00:35:29,129 --> 00:35:31,631
BRASS:
<i>So, that new Lamborghini</i>
<i>is a pretty smooth ride.</i>

00:35:31,698 --> 00:35:32,799
Grant from the dealership

00:35:32,866 --> 00:35:34,267
told me you
bought one recently.

00:35:34,334 --> 00:35:35,368
It was a gift.

00:35:35,435 --> 00:35:36,369
For who?

00:35:36,436 --> 00:35:37,370
Tanya Rollins.

00:35:37,437 --> 00:35:39,172
You got to woo the talent.

00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:40,507
Yeah, she's cute.

00:35:40,573 --> 00:35:41,708
How old is she?

00:35:41,775 --> 00:35:44,477
Twenty-four.

00:35:44,544 --> 00:35:46,179
So, you been together
nine years--

00:35:46,246 --> 00:35:47,447
that'll make
her about 15

00:35:47,514 --> 00:35:49,416
when you consummated
the relationship.

00:35:49,482 --> 00:35:51,418
Don't you know that
15 will get you 20?

00:35:51,484 --> 00:35:52,419
What do you want?

00:35:52,485 --> 00:35:54,187
Why was Tanya's
Lamborghini

00:35:54,254 --> 00:35:56,423
parked in Bruce
Eiger's driveway?

00:35:56,489 --> 00:35:57,490
They were involved.

00:35:57,557 --> 00:35:58,925
I thought she
was your girl.

00:35:58,992 --> 00:36:01,094
Tanya always goes
where the best deal is.

00:36:01,161 --> 00:36:03,063
I "rolled" her,
Bruce bankrolled her.

00:36:03,129 --> 00:36:04,464
Her career-- smart move.

00:36:04,531 --> 00:36:06,900
Turned out she actually
had other talents.

00:36:06,967 --> 00:36:08,668
She was making him
a ton of money,

00:36:08,735 --> 00:36:09,803
so I gave her a call.

00:36:09,869 --> 00:36:11,137
You poached her.

00:36:11,204 --> 00:36:13,807
Ah, come on, look,
she jumped at it, all right?

00:36:13,873 --> 00:36:16,676
Tanya said he was a freak
and she wanted out.

00:36:16,743 --> 00:36:17,677
Then what?

00:36:17,744 --> 00:36:19,579
'Cause I got felony sex,
infidelities

00:36:19,646 --> 00:36:22,282
and a picture of a baby
I don't know anything about.

00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:25,118
Come on, we both
know what I was after.

00:36:25,185 --> 00:36:27,587
So, all's well
that ends well, huh, Sy?

00:36:27,654 --> 00:36:29,155
I didn't want him dead.

00:36:29,222 --> 00:36:32,092
There's no sport
in humiliating a dead man.

00:36:32,158 --> 00:36:34,394
Now, if you'll excuse me,
Captain.

00:36:38,531 --> 00:36:41,167
WILLOWS:
Your fingerprints are
all over the nursery.

00:36:41,234 --> 00:36:44,571
The DNA that we took
from your breast pump

00:36:44,638 --> 00:36:47,607
matches the milk
from Bruce's fridge.

00:36:47,674 --> 00:36:50,110
And the arresting officer

00:36:50,176 --> 00:36:53,279
confiscated LSD
from your purse.

00:36:53,346 --> 00:36:58,351
And your cell phone is full
of pictures of "Baby Bruce."

00:37:00,954 --> 00:37:03,223
Sy said
all that Bruce had was fear.

00:37:03,289 --> 00:37:05,125
Yeah, there's really
not much to fear

00:37:05,191 --> 00:37:06,826
about a crying man
in a diaper.

00:37:08,228 --> 00:37:10,897
All right, Baby Bruce.

00:37:10,964 --> 00:37:12,866
Playtime's over.

00:37:14,134 --> 00:37:15,502
( <i>smooching noises</i> )

00:37:15,568 --> 00:37:16,870
I smell a smelly.

00:37:17,904 --> 00:37:21,508
You made a big messy
in your diaper.

00:37:21,574 --> 00:37:23,910
You ready?

00:37:23,977 --> 00:37:26,680
There you go.
That feels so good.

00:37:26,746 --> 00:37:29,749
Mommy's got a special treat
for you.

00:37:29,816 --> 00:37:33,219
It's extra special today.

00:37:34,521 --> 00:37:38,525
♪ ...wonder what you are... ♪

00:37:40,493 --> 00:37:42,829
And then, he just started
acting crazy.

00:37:42,896 --> 00:37:46,599
As opposed to soiling himself
and gumming your nipples?

00:37:46,666 --> 00:37:47,267
Yes.

00:37:47,334 --> 00:37:48,001
( <i>grunting</i> )

00:37:48,068 --> 00:37:49,602
What is it with you, Brucie?

00:37:49,669 --> 00:37:50,503
What are you doing?

00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:51,671
What is wrong?

00:37:51,738 --> 00:37:55,175
( <i>grunting</i> )

00:37:55,241 --> 00:37:58,011
Wait, that's a bad boy.

00:37:58,078 --> 00:38:01,514
( <i>muttering</i> )

00:38:01,581 --> 00:38:02,549
The light.

00:38:02,615 --> 00:38:04,651
I see the light... I see...

00:38:04,718 --> 00:38:05,719
What is it
with you, Bruce?

00:38:05,785 --> 00:38:07,721
What's wrong?

00:38:07,787 --> 00:38:08,788
( <i>Bruce crying</i> )

00:38:08,855 --> 00:38:13,460
And then, he just...
jumped off the balcony.

00:38:13,526 --> 00:38:14,394
That's it?

00:38:16,663 --> 00:38:20,834
You knew this man's
most intimate secret.

00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:23,036
You could've left him.

00:38:23,103 --> 00:38:24,804
Nobody leaves Bruce.

00:38:24,871 --> 00:38:26,072
What were you afraid of?

00:38:30,076 --> 00:38:33,079
That I'd never
see my baby again.

00:38:34,648 --> 00:38:36,683
Bruce said that
he wanted a baby.

00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:39,619
That he'd take care
of both of us.

00:38:39,686 --> 00:38:41,388
And you believed him?

00:38:43,123 --> 00:38:44,591
Yeah.

00:38:44,658 --> 00:38:47,560
Only after the delivery,

00:38:47,627 --> 00:38:51,898
he said he had
to take the baby away.

00:38:51,965 --> 00:38:56,503
That he was going to take him
to be with his mom.

00:38:56,569 --> 00:38:59,105
You know, wait

00:38:59,172 --> 00:39:01,341
until my career took off.

00:39:01,408 --> 00:39:05,645
Until I was ready
to be a mother myself.

00:39:07,347 --> 00:39:09,416
And then he took me

00:39:09,482 --> 00:39:11,518
to his nursery.

00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,957
He explained to me, you know,
about infantilism.

00:39:20,961 --> 00:39:23,930
Said that it was in the Bible.

00:39:23,997 --> 00:39:25,799
And then he made me clean him.

00:39:25,865 --> 00:39:27,434
How long ago was that?

00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,602
Five years.

00:39:29,669 --> 00:39:31,805
Five years and every week,
I would ask him

00:39:31,871 --> 00:39:34,040
if I could see my baby

00:39:34,107 --> 00:39:37,010
and he kept saying next week.

00:39:37,077 --> 00:39:38,712
"Sure, Tanya, next week."

00:39:38,778 --> 00:39:39,779
"No, maybe next week."

00:39:39,846 --> 00:39:41,915
You know, "maybe
the next week after that."

00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:46,519
I guess in my heart I knew that
it was never going to happen.

00:39:46,586 --> 00:39:48,254
It's just that...

00:39:48,321 --> 00:39:52,192
that was the only connection
I had to my baby, you know?

00:39:52,258 --> 00:39:57,263
That and nursing Bruce.

00:39:57,330 --> 00:39:58,798
Tanya,

00:39:58,865 --> 00:40:01,901
this man exploited you
for five years.

00:40:01,968 --> 00:40:05,939
He didn't allow you to see
your only child and...

00:40:06,006 --> 00:40:10,443
there he was, high as a kite
and you're the only one there.

00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:12,145
Are you saying that you didn't

00:40:12,212 --> 00:40:14,681
offer him any encouragement
off that balcony?

00:40:14,748 --> 00:40:20,654
If I asked you to jump
off a bridge would you do it?

00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:25,692
( <i>whimpering</i> )

00:40:25,759 --> 00:40:26,826
Fly, Brucie, fly.

Show Mommy how you
can fly like a birdie!

00:40:28,561 --> 00:40:30,063
Come on, you can fly!

00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:31,064
I can fly.

00:40:31,131 --> 00:40:32,065
You can fly.

I can fly, Mommy.
I can fly, Mommy.

You can fly!
I can fly.

You can fly,

I can fly, Mommy.

WOMAN:
No.

00:40:54,254 --> 00:40:58,024
I've never seen that baby
before in my life.

00:40:58,091 --> 00:41:01,561
Well, Bruce said he gave you
his lover's baby to raise.

00:41:01,628 --> 00:41:03,363
The mother's name
was Tanya.

00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:07,200
Do I look like I
could raise a baby?

00:41:07,267 --> 00:41:09,235
When was the last time
you saw your son, Mrs. Eiger?

00:41:09,302 --> 00:41:11,237
Seven years ago.

00:41:11,304 --> 00:41:13,039
You didn't know he had kids?

00:41:13,106 --> 00:41:17,978
Do you know what my mother
told me when I had Bruce?

00:41:18,044 --> 00:41:19,546
What's that?

00:41:19,612 --> 00:41:23,984
Suckle the baby,
cuckold the man.

00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:26,052
I don't follow.

00:41:26,119 --> 00:41:28,855
You were breast-fed.

00:41:28,922 --> 00:41:30,523
Yeah.

00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:32,492
My mother was
a firm believer

00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:34,494
that the way
you raised a boy

00:41:34,561 --> 00:41:35,996
was to make him hard.

00:41:36,062 --> 00:41:37,597
To let him know

00:41:37,664 --> 00:41:41,501
what the world was like
right out of the womb.

00:41:41,568 --> 00:41:43,236
And what's the world like?

00:41:43,303 --> 00:41:46,773
No free lunch.

00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:52,245
All these mothers
coddling their toddlers.

00:41:52,312 --> 00:41:54,681
Look where we are.

00:41:54,748 --> 00:41:57,784

00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,522
Which part?

00:42:02,589 --> 00:42:04,157
The part where I got
in your face

00:42:04,224 --> 00:42:07,093
or the part where I,
uh, lost evidence,

00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,129
or maybe you just miss me.

00:42:09,195 --> 00:42:10,330
I did miss you.

00:42:10,397 --> 00:42:13,533
I missed your passion
and your tenacity.

00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,535
I even missed your tush.

( <i>chokes</i> )

00:42:16,936 --> 00:42:17,871

Sorry to interrupt.

00:42:20,807 --> 00:42:21,975
I miss the punch line?

00:42:22,042 --> 00:42:22,809
Yeah.

00:42:23,709 --> 00:42:25,812
So Bruce lied about the kid.

00:42:25,878 --> 00:42:27,513
There was
an out-of-state adoption

00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:29,382
that placed the day
the kid was born.

00:42:29,448 --> 00:42:31,117
And Bruce's mother...

00:42:31,184 --> 00:42:32,318
A light beer, please.

00:42:32,385 --> 00:42:34,887
His mother was
a piece of work.

00:42:34,954 --> 00:42:40,326
So, is Tanya going
to take the fall?

00:42:40,393 --> 00:42:41,327
Can't convict her

00:42:41,394 --> 00:42:42,662
for cheerleading.

00:42:42,728 --> 00:42:44,497
You can if there's LSD
in her pom-poms.

00:42:44,564 --> 00:42:46,466
Acid makes
her culpable.

00:42:46,532 --> 00:42:47,733
Class A felony.

00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,101
Any more culpable
than his wife,

00:42:49,168 --> 00:42:50,336
who just let him lie there?

00:42:50,403 --> 00:42:52,104
You know, what I can't get
my mind wrapped around

00:42:52,171 --> 00:42:54,240
is, uh, you got a guy
who's tough enough

00:42:54,307 --> 00:42:56,342
to get to the top
of the heap in Vegas,

00:42:56,409 --> 00:42:57,977
all this power,

00:42:58,044 --> 00:42:59,445
and he ends up
crawling around a playpen.

00:42:59,512 --> 00:43:01,747
That's the point,
isn't it?

00:43:01,814 --> 00:43:03,416
It's only the truly powerful

00:43:03,483 --> 00:43:05,885
that have the luxury
to relinquish power.

00:43:07,019 --> 00:43:09,322
But diapers?

00:43:09,388 --> 00:43:10,723
Why not?

00:43:12,325 --> 00:43:14,994
Where would you go if you had
the connections and the cash

00:43:15,061 --> 00:43:16,629
to go anywhere
you wanted?

00:43:16,696 --> 00:43:17,730
I hear Fiji's nice.

00:43:17,797 --> 00:43:18,865
Eiger went further.

00:43:18,931 --> 00:43:21,134
He went all the way back
to his childhood.

00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,902
Yeah.

00:43:22,969 --> 00:43:25,271
I think I'd take Fiji.
