00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:21,502
Welcome back, Mrs. Krell.

00:00:21,569 --> 00:00:23,304
I told you, it's Martha.

00:00:23,371 --> 00:00:25,506
Your room's ready

00:00:25,573 --> 00:00:26,574
and I have your credit card
on file.

00:00:26,641 --> 00:00:28,809
See you in the morning.
I'm beat.

00:00:34,015 --> 00:00:36,317
CLERK:
Call me if you need anything,
Martha.

00:00:55,503 --> 00:00:57,905
( <i>screams</i> )

00:00:57,972 --> 00:01:00,741
Decedent's name is Martha Krell.
Flight attendant.

00:01:00,808 --> 00:01:03,144
She checked in this afternoon.

00:01:03,211 --> 00:01:04,812
Apparently, she was stabbed
to death.

00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,247
The coroner's en route.

00:01:07,548 --> 00:01:10,952
Weird... no sign of struggle.

00:01:11,018 --> 00:01:14,188
No clothes,
no luggage.

00:01:14,255 --> 00:01:17,959
SARA:
Bedspread's undisturbed.

00:01:18,025 --> 00:01:20,061
Trashcan is empty

00:01:20,127 --> 00:01:21,629
and the inside is spotless.

00:01:21,696 --> 00:01:23,231
It's possible
a liner's been removed.

00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,268
Take a whiff.

00:01:27,335 --> 00:01:29,237
Smells clean.

00:01:29,303 --> 00:01:30,872
Smells like a hospital.

00:01:30,938 --> 00:01:32,740
Bleaches and deodorizers.

00:01:32,807 --> 00:01:34,375
Killer attacked
the victim,

00:01:34,442 --> 00:01:36,744
then cleaned and sanitized
the room.

00:01:36,811 --> 00:01:40,314
Ah, but here's the smell
of the blood still,

00:01:40,381 --> 00:01:43,484
and all the perfumes
in Arabia will not sweeten

00:01:43,551 --> 00:01:45,119

( <i>garbled radio transmission)</i>

00:02:25,181 --> 00:02:27,625
Her liver temp's 83 degrees.

00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:29,961
She's been dead
approximately ten hours.

00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,299
I'd like to get a clear photo
of her wounds.

00:02:34,365 --> 00:02:35,300
Can we lay her out?

00:02:35,366 --> 00:02:36,701
Oh, yeah. Grab her feet.

00:02:41,573 --> 00:02:43,675
( <i>joints crackling</i> )

00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:49,614
Defensive wounds.

00:02:51,749 --> 00:02:53,651
Incised.

00:02:53,718 --> 00:02:55,420
At least a dozen.

00:02:55,486 --> 00:02:57,655
She did not want to die.

00:02:57,722 --> 00:02:59,657
I just got the call.

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,493
Where's Grissom?

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,394
Bathroom.

00:03:04,562 --> 00:03:06,030
Working the, uh, case.

00:03:10,735 --> 00:03:12,437
Hey.

00:03:12,503 --> 00:03:14,572
Hand me my multi-tool,
will ya, Greg?

00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:15,740
I need a Phillips.

00:03:23,915 --> 00:03:24,916
What are you doing?

00:03:24,983 --> 00:03:26,217
Well, the stabbing
was brutal,

00:03:26,284 --> 00:03:28,453
but the crime
scene is clean.

00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:30,722
No cast-off, no spatter.

00:03:30,788 --> 00:03:35,260
So, I want to know if the killer
washed blood down the drain.

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,075
Swab and phenol this,
will ya?

00:04:03,821 --> 00:04:05,557
Blood.

00:04:05,623 --> 00:04:08,893
Label it. Send it to DNA.

00:04:18,603 --> 00:04:21,773
Usually in hotel rooms,
we find too many prints.

00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,941
Not a single one.

00:04:23,007 --> 00:04:25,376
Just wipes and swipes.

00:04:27,212 --> 00:04:29,214
Ms. Krell was a real nice lady.

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,449
She brought me
a Dodger baseball cap.

00:04:31,516 --> 00:04:32,817
Wow. So you were friends?

00:04:32,884 --> 00:04:34,018
Not really.

00:04:34,085 --> 00:04:36,955
Airlines buy a chunk of rooms
for their trolley dollies,

00:04:37,021 --> 00:04:38,590
discounted.

00:04:38,656 --> 00:04:40,024
She's been staying here
for a few months.

00:04:40,091 --> 00:04:41,793
So you discovered
the body.

00:04:41,859 --> 00:04:42,860
Her supervisor called

00:04:42,927 --> 00:04:44,662
to say her A.M. flight
was canceled.

00:04:44,729 --> 00:04:46,798
She wasn't
answering her phone.

00:04:46,864 --> 00:04:49,267
He asked me to make sure
she got the message.

00:04:49,334 --> 00:04:50,668
So you knocked
on her door,

00:04:50,735 --> 00:04:53,438
and when she didn't answer,
you just went right in?

00:04:53,504 --> 00:04:55,940
Yeah. I got a master key.

00:04:56,007 --> 00:04:57,442
Yeah, I knew that.

00:04:57,508 --> 00:04:59,310
Does the hotel have
surveillance?

00:04:59,377 --> 00:05:01,145
Nope.

00:05:01,212 --> 00:05:02,380
Thank you.
You've been a big help.

00:05:02,447 --> 00:05:03,381
Right on.

00:05:03,448 --> 00:05:07,619
Excuse me.
I'm Hayden Michaels.

00:05:07,685 --> 00:05:08,620
I'm the manager
of the Four Aces.

00:05:08,686 --> 00:05:10,855
I just got the call.

00:05:10,922 --> 00:05:12,390
Anything we can
do to help?

00:05:12,457 --> 00:05:13,725
Thank you.
I'll let you know.

00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:14,893
Detective,

00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:16,461
if this hits
the media,

00:05:16,527 --> 00:05:18,830
this is really going
to hurt our business.

00:05:18,897 --> 00:05:20,565
What are you asking me?

00:05:20,632 --> 00:05:23,067
Anything you can do
to keep it out of the press?

00:05:23,134 --> 00:05:24,702
Look, I'm trying
to catch a killer.

00:05:24,769 --> 00:05:27,005
I got no control
over the press.

00:05:27,071 --> 00:05:30,308
If this makes the news,
then it is what it is.

00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:38,116
( <i>garbled radio transmission)</i>

00:05:54,165 --> 00:05:56,234
Hey. Victim's
in the bedroom.

00:05:56,301 --> 00:05:58,336
Ty Hawkins, 12.

00:05:58,403 --> 00:06:02,140
Mother came in to wake him...

00:06:02,206 --> 00:06:03,675
found him like this.

00:06:05,777 --> 00:06:07,178
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:06:07,245 --> 00:06:08,613
Beaten to death.

00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,448
This many blows,
it was personal.

00:06:10,515 --> 00:06:13,585
Liver temp makes T.O.D.
around midnight.

00:06:13,651 --> 00:06:14,586
No sign
of forced entry.

00:06:14,652 --> 00:06:15,587
nothing's missing.

00:06:15,653 --> 00:06:17,121
All the doors and
windows were locked

00:06:17,188 --> 00:06:19,224
except for
the screen door.

00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,392
Parents claim
they keep that locked.

00:06:21,459 --> 00:06:23,595
You find a weapon?

00:06:23,661 --> 00:06:24,696
Negative.

00:06:24,762 --> 00:06:26,264
Family's been transported
down to the station.

00:06:26,331 --> 00:06:27,732
I'm gonna go down
and take their statement.

00:06:27,799 --> 00:06:29,567
Hey, when you're
done here,

00:06:29,634 --> 00:06:30,868
roll by.
We'll ink them.

00:06:30,935 --> 00:06:32,770
You got it.

00:06:35,406 --> 00:06:37,742
Boy's not even safe
in his own bed.

00:06:37,809 --> 00:06:39,911
I'll take the inside.

00:06:39,978 --> 00:06:42,847
Yeah, I could use the fresh air.

00:08:51,009 --> 00:08:53,478
Found a pile of pipes
by the side of the house

00:08:53,545 --> 00:08:54,512
One seems to be missing.

00:08:54,579 --> 00:08:57,181
This is an exemplar
of a possible murder weapon.

00:08:57,248 --> 00:08:59,050
And I cast a shoe impression

00:08:59,117 --> 00:09:00,251
just outside
the kid's bedroom window.

00:09:00,318 --> 00:09:01,586
Also some graffiti

00:09:01,653 --> 00:09:03,054
on the window-- B-R-A-T.

00:09:03,121 --> 00:09:05,023
Maybe somebody had it in
for the kid.

00:09:05,089 --> 00:09:09,327
Well, I bagged the bloody sheets
from the bed.

00:09:09,394 --> 00:09:11,896
Found boxers, a T-shirt
and a fitted sheet

00:09:11,963 --> 00:09:13,765
in the washer.

00:09:13,831 --> 00:09:16,000
ALS'd for blood, found urine.

00:09:16,067 --> 00:09:19,737
Mm. Well, whoever killed the boy
knew how to get in and out

00:09:19,804 --> 00:09:21,673
of this house
without waking the family.

00:09:26,644 --> 00:09:27,645
No mystery here.

00:09:27,712 --> 00:09:30,348
Ms. Krell was violently
stabbed to death.

00:09:30,415 --> 00:09:31,516
C.O.D. exsanguination.

00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:32,584
SAE kit?

00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:33,885
She was raped.

00:09:33,952 --> 00:09:36,254
Contusions to the
vaginal introitus

00:09:36,321 --> 00:09:38,923
and an eighth-inch
hemorrhagic laceration

00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,425
at the vaginal fourchette.

00:09:40,491 --> 00:09:42,260
6:00 position.
The attack was brutal.

00:09:42,327 --> 00:09:44,162
Aren't they always?

00:09:44,229 --> 00:09:45,830
I don't know why people think

00:09:45,897 --> 00:09:47,966
that rape has anything
to do with sex.

00:09:48,032 --> 00:09:51,502
If a guy just wants sex,
he can hire a hooker.

00:09:51,569 --> 00:09:52,303
What else?

00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:53,438
Well, there is
some good news.

00:09:53,504 --> 00:09:55,173
Motile sperm in the wet mount.

00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,174
I've sent the kit

00:09:56,241 --> 00:09:58,610
to DNA for analysis.

00:10:01,813 --> 00:10:03,815
Ecklie, what's up?

00:10:03,882 --> 00:10:06,584
I paged Grissom.

00:10:06,651 --> 00:10:10,355
And he paged me.

00:10:10,421 --> 00:10:12,156
How can I help you?

00:10:12,223 --> 00:10:16,461
Five years ago, there was
this, uh, day-shift case,

00:10:16,527 --> 00:10:18,963
Homicide. The victim
was a flight attendant

00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:22,367
named Sue Stein
from Palo Alto, California.

00:10:22,433 --> 00:10:25,670
She was raped
and murdered
in a local hotel.

00:10:25,737 --> 00:10:27,071
Killer was never
apprehended.

00:10:37,849 --> 00:10:41,219
Vic's clothing and suitcase
were missing.

00:10:41,286 --> 00:10:43,354
Room was immaculate,
smelled like disinfectant.

00:10:43,421 --> 00:10:44,589
Same signature.

00:10:44,656 --> 00:10:45,857
One difference.

00:10:45,924 --> 00:10:48,226
In the prior case,
body was found

00:10:48,293 --> 00:10:49,861
in a first floor room.

00:10:49,928 --> 00:10:51,963
Sliding glass door
facing the pool was unlocked.

00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,831
Ms. Krell was killed
on the second floor.

00:10:53,898 --> 00:10:55,533
There was only one way
into her room.

00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,237
Was there semen present
in Sue Stein's SAE kit?

00:10:59,304 --> 00:11:00,505
Yeah. Ran it through CODIS.
No hit.

00:11:00,572 --> 00:11:01,506
I asked Mia to compare it

00:11:01,573 --> 00:11:04,809
with the semen
from the recent attack.

00:11:04,876 --> 00:11:06,844
Is that fingerprint
from your crime scene?

00:11:06,911 --> 00:11:10,081
Only print we found.
Impressed in Sue's blood

00:11:10,148 --> 00:11:12,350
on the bedspread
near her hips.

00:11:12,417 --> 00:11:13,918
Underlying pattern
on the fabric

00:11:13,985 --> 00:11:16,020
made it impossible to read.

00:11:16,087 --> 00:11:17,922
That was then.

00:11:17,989 --> 00:11:19,057
This is now.

00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:24,709
My son's dead.
Why are you fingerprinting me?

00:11:24,709 --> 00:11:27,333
The crime lab is going to
dust your house for prints,

00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:28,868
so I need to know
which ones are yours.

00:11:28,935 --> 00:11:32,138
Now, your wife said that you
both went to bed after the news.

00:11:32,205 --> 00:11:33,439
I already told you that.

00:11:33,506 --> 00:11:34,474
Twice.

00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:37,877
You know, I... I got
questions, too, you know.

00:11:37,944 --> 00:11:40,647
Why Ty?

00:11:42,749 --> 00:11:44,684
Why not me?

00:11:44,751 --> 00:11:49,522
How could my wife and
I sleep... ( <i>sighing</i> )

00:11:49,589 --> 00:11:51,024
through it all?

00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:53,159
Mr. Hawkins, would you
stand up, facing me,

00:11:53,226 --> 00:11:54,494
so I can take some photos?

00:11:54,561 --> 00:11:56,563
Is this really necessary?

00:11:56,629 --> 00:11:58,231
Please, just let him do his job.

00:11:58,298 --> 00:11:59,766
Sir...

00:12:10,577 --> 00:12:12,212
( <i>clears throat</i> )

00:12:12,278 --> 00:12:13,446
Open up.

00:12:17,116 --> 00:12:19,552
I'll be needing
to take your shoes.

00:12:19,619 --> 00:12:22,188
You can wear some booties home.

00:12:22,255 --> 00:12:23,690
What now?

00:12:23,756 --> 00:12:25,492
You and your wife
are free to go.

00:12:25,558 --> 00:12:27,927
What about Matt?

00:12:27,994 --> 00:12:30,864
He has to stay here
in protective custody

00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:32,632
until this is resolved.

00:12:38,404 --> 00:12:39,506
Yvonne.

00:12:39,572 --> 00:12:40,907
Hey.

00:12:43,109 --> 00:12:44,377
They're keeping Matt.

00:12:44,444 --> 00:12:46,980
I know. He'll be home soon.

00:12:47,046 --> 00:12:48,615
It's just procedure.

00:12:48,681 --> 00:12:50,283
Right?
Right.

00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,684
Can we at least
speak to him?

00:12:51,751 --> 00:12:53,653
Can't allow that.

00:12:59,526 --> 00:13:01,361
Come on, let-let's go.

00:13:01,427 --> 00:13:02,762
Come on.

00:13:09,636 --> 00:13:10,904
You just gonna let them go?

00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:12,472
Neither has a record, no motive.

00:13:12,539 --> 00:13:13,706
There's no blood on them.

00:13:13,773 --> 00:13:15,608
Well, they could've showered,
tossed their clothes.

00:13:15,675 --> 00:13:17,277
Their grief is not an act.

00:13:17,343 --> 00:13:18,311
Yeah, based on what?

00:13:18,378 --> 00:13:19,312
Years of listening

00:13:19,379 --> 00:13:20,980
to the parents of dead children.

00:13:22,448 --> 00:13:24,417
Let's go talk to this kid.

00:13:26,119 --> 00:13:27,987
Hey, Mia.

00:13:33,293 --> 00:13:37,997
Let me guess, you're
listening to something
classy like Jessica

00:13:38,064 --> 00:13:39,532
or Ashlee.

00:13:41,634 --> 00:13:45,972
( <i>man speaking French</i>
<i>through headset</i> )

00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:47,974
It's... Jean-Paul Sartre.

00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:49,142
<i>"Huis Clos."</i>

00:13:49,209 --> 00:13:51,845
"No Exit."

00:13:51,911 --> 00:13:53,913
It loses something
in a translation.

00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,648
<i>Oui, oui.</i>

00:13:55,715 --> 00:13:59,018
The blood from the hairy wad
that you found in the drain

00:13:59,085 --> 00:14:01,454
is consistent
with the victim.

00:14:01,521 --> 00:14:03,823
And what about the semen
from Martha's SAE?

00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:06,192
That's consistent with the DNA
from the first attack.

00:14:06,259 --> 00:14:09,028
You are looking
at the same rapist.

00:14:09,095 --> 00:14:10,463
I want to show you something.

00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:12,832
Really?

00:14:21,674 --> 00:14:24,711
This guy's immune system
doesn't recognize his own sperm.

00:14:24,777 --> 00:14:26,946
Antibodies are attacking
the little guys.

00:14:27,013 --> 00:14:28,882
I read about this phenomenon
in a forensic journal...

00:14:28,948 --> 00:14:31,417
November, 2003.

00:14:31,484 --> 00:14:33,786
Killer had a vasectomy,
then had it reversed.

00:14:33,853 --> 00:14:34,787
<i>Oui, oui.</i>

00:14:34,854 --> 00:14:35,922
Thanks, Mia.

00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:41,261
How could a boy have
made someone so mad?

00:14:41,327 --> 00:14:43,062
COD is blunt-force trauma.

00:14:43,129 --> 00:14:44,998
I counted 14 separate blows.

00:14:45,064 --> 00:14:46,866
Several more were coinciding.

00:14:46,933 --> 00:14:48,735
Cylindrical weapon,
about an inch

00:14:48,801 --> 00:14:49,736
in diameter.

00:14:49,802 --> 00:14:51,538
Consistent with a pipe?

00:14:51,604 --> 00:14:54,507
Yeah. In fact, check this out.

00:14:54,574 --> 00:14:58,044
Thread pattern's consistent
with the end of a pipe.

00:15:01,981 --> 00:15:03,983
He's got no defense wounds.

00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:05,752
Yeah. My guess,

00:15:05,819 --> 00:15:07,220
he never woke up.

00:15:09,556 --> 00:15:11,491
CAVALIERE:
You're not fooling me, kid.

00:15:11,558 --> 00:15:15,895
The second I laid eyes on you,
I knew how it went down.

00:15:15,962 --> 00:15:18,565
You took a pipe
from the backyard,

00:15:18,631 --> 00:15:20,300
you went into Ty's bedroom,

00:15:20,366 --> 00:15:22,836
and while he was sleeping,

00:15:22,902 --> 00:15:25,872
you beat his brains to a pulp.

00:15:25,939 --> 00:15:28,341
Now, what the hell's
wrong with you, kid?

00:15:28,408 --> 00:15:30,777
Your little brother is dead.

00:15:30,844 --> 00:15:33,446
What did he
ever do to you?

00:15:33,513 --> 00:15:35,515
Now, don't look at him.
He can't help you.

00:15:35,582 --> 00:15:38,852
Nobody can help you.
You're going to prison.

00:15:38,918 --> 00:15:43,423
At 14, that means life.

00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:44,958
I'm talking to you,
you little...!

00:15:45,024 --> 00:15:45,859
Detective...

00:15:45,925 --> 00:15:50,530
can I have a word
with you outside, please?

00:15:57,937 --> 00:15:59,873
We don't have enough evidence

00:15:59,939 --> 00:16:02,075
to suggest that
that boy killed his brother.

00:16:02,141 --> 00:16:05,145
What are you getting at?

00:16:05,211 --> 00:16:06,679
I'm saying I'm not sure
if threatening him

00:16:06,746 --> 00:16:07,814
is the right tactic right now.

00:16:07,881 --> 00:16:08,982
I found no blood
on his clothes.

00:16:09,048 --> 00:16:11,918
The screen door could have
been the point of entry.

00:16:11,985 --> 00:16:14,454
I mean, have you considered
asking him what he heard

00:16:14,521 --> 00:16:17,090
or-or saw before you just put
the full court press on him?

00:16:17,157 --> 00:16:19,592
I don't tell you how to
collect the evidence.

00:16:19,659 --> 00:16:22,028
No, you don't. Look, there's
no disrespect here, okay?

00:16:22,095 --> 00:16:23,296
We're all on the same team.

00:16:23,363 --> 00:16:27,534
Then get to the lab and get
me something that I can use.

00:16:28,568 --> 00:16:29,769
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:16:31,337 --> 00:16:32,705
( <i>electronic beep</i> )

00:16:32,772 --> 00:16:34,107
Hey.

00:16:34,174 --> 00:16:35,775
Hey. Call me a geek,

00:16:35,842 --> 00:16:38,244
but background subtraction
application software

00:16:38,311 --> 00:16:39,779
is the bomb.

00:16:39,846 --> 00:16:41,648
Only geeks still say "the bomb."

00:16:41,714 --> 00:16:45,351
But it you ask me, geeks
should be revered.

00:16:45,418 --> 00:16:47,487
Okay. Um,

00:16:47,554 --> 00:16:49,489
the technology's pretty new.

00:16:49,556 --> 00:16:52,358
You'll get hammered on cross,
but it definitely works.

00:16:52,425 --> 00:16:53,426
Okay, check it out.

00:16:53,493 --> 00:16:55,995
So the fingerprint is
blood-red-- that's the shade

00:16:56,062 --> 00:16:57,330
we use for
the color identifier--

00:16:57,397 --> 00:16:58,832
and now the preprogrammed
algorithm

00:16:58,898 --> 00:17:01,201
is just removing all the
other colors from the fabric,

00:17:01,267 --> 00:17:03,102
and we're left with
just the print. It's...

00:17:03,169 --> 00:17:04,470
Mind if I watch?

00:17:04,537 --> 00:17:07,106
Voyeur, huh?

00:17:07,173 --> 00:17:08,107
I like that.

00:17:08,174 --> 00:17:08,708
Geek.

00:17:10,043 --> 00:17:10,977
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:17:11,044 --> 00:17:12,312
( <i>taps key, beep</i> )

00:17:12,378 --> 00:17:14,180
Wow.
Yeah.

00:17:15,949 --> 00:17:17,784
Right.
( <i>taps keys</i> )

00:17:17,851 --> 00:17:19,786
Scan this into I-AFIS,

00:17:19,853 --> 00:17:21,154
and here we go.

00:17:27,961 --> 00:17:30,129
Got yourself a hit.

00:17:30,196 --> 00:17:32,565
"Jesse Acheson. 38.

00:17:32,632 --> 00:17:35,468

Was he in or out

00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:43,309
Out.

00:17:43,376 --> 00:17:44,844
What about last night?

00:17:44,911 --> 00:17:46,980
Released six months ago.
Living in Henderson.

WOMAN:
Who is it?

00:17:56,589 --> 00:17:57,957
Las Vegas Police.

00:18:00,493 --> 00:18:03,696
We're looking for Jesse Acheson.

00:18:03,763 --> 00:18:06,199
Hey, look, my husband
hasn't used

00:18:06,266 --> 00:18:07,600
since he got out
of the joint,

00:18:07,667 --> 00:18:10,003
so whatever you think
he did, you're wrong.

00:18:10,069 --> 00:18:11,838
Do you know where he is?

00:18:11,905 --> 00:18:13,406
No idea.

00:18:13,473 --> 00:18:16,242
Well, your marriage is just
full of romance, huh?

00:18:16,309 --> 00:18:18,044
May we come in?

00:18:18,111 --> 00:18:19,546
Nah, I don't think so.

00:18:19,612 --> 00:18:20,580
Just one more question.

00:18:20,647 --> 00:18:22,615
Do you happen to know
where he was last night?

00:18:22,682 --> 00:18:25,285
No. I, uh, I haven't
seen him in days.

00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,685

Pick me up in five minutes.

00:18:38,896 --> 00:18:40,565

What the hell's going on?

00:18:54,736 --> 00:18:56,104
No, I didn't tell them
where you are!

00:18:56,171 --> 00:18:57,539
I don't know where
the hell you are!

00:18:57,606 --> 00:18:59,474
When are you
coming home?

00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:01,209
Jesse...

00:19:01,276 --> 00:19:02,978
Damn you!

<i>The shoe impression</i>
<i>outside Ty's window</i>

00:20:05,941 --> 00:20:07,976
matches the brother's

00:20:08,043 --> 00:20:10,512
Yeah, I got a hair
off of Ty's T-shirt.

00:20:10,579 --> 00:20:12,247
Also consistent with Matt.

00:20:12,314 --> 00:20:15,083
Either of which could be related
to the murder or just a result

00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:16,585
of two brothers
living together.

00:20:16,651 --> 00:20:18,253
Yeah.
What's in the bindle?

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,855
Uh, Blue fibers.

00:20:19,921 --> 00:20:21,490
Got them off
the vic's T-shirt.

00:20:21,556 --> 00:20:24,025
Nobody in the family
was wearing anything blue.

00:20:24,092 --> 00:20:25,460
No, but you know,

00:20:25,527 --> 00:20:27,629
could be
from a blanket,
a carpet, towel.

00:20:27,696 --> 00:20:29,297
I'll take them to Trace.

00:20:29,364 --> 00:20:32,768
Hey, I am concerned
that Detective Cavaliere's

00:20:32,834 --> 00:20:34,836
moving ahead of Forensics
on this one.

00:20:34,903 --> 00:20:36,438
He can move as
fast as wants.

00:20:36,505 --> 00:20:38,673
The D.A. won't file without
the physical evidence.

00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:41,376
Right now, we got nothing.

00:20:41,443 --> 00:20:45,247
Sandra Acheson called
her husband at exactly
3:03 p.m. today.

00:20:45,313 --> 00:20:49,885
I secured a 2703-D court order
for the number she was calling.

00:20:49,951 --> 00:20:51,019
It was a cell phone.

00:20:51,086 --> 00:20:53,422
I contacted the cell phone
company and found out

00:20:53,488 --> 00:20:56,091
that Jesse answered his phone
near Tower 8, phase West.

00:20:56,158 --> 00:20:58,293
Given the signal strength,

00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,530
he was within two blocks
of the tower.

00:21:01,596 --> 00:21:03,865
His wife said that
she hasn't seen him

00:21:03,932 --> 00:21:06,968
in several days, so I had
Homicide check registration

00:21:07,035 --> 00:21:08,770
at all the hotels
within the yellow area.

00:21:08,837 --> 00:21:12,040
He is booked at the Tangiers.

00:21:12,107 --> 00:21:14,409
Well done.

00:21:14,476 --> 00:21:16,578
Get this--

00:21:16,645 --> 00:21:19,081
the rapist's semen came back
positive for cocaine.

00:21:19,147 --> 00:21:22,184
We don't usually run
a panel for semen, Greg.

00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,486
I know that, but given
our suspect's priors

00:21:24,553 --> 00:21:26,755
for blow, I had a tech
run an immunoassay

00:21:26,822 --> 00:21:27,923
specific to the drug.

00:21:27,989 --> 00:21:31,259
Wow. You guys are
rendering me obsolete.

00:21:32,694 --> 00:21:34,696
So, Jesse gets coked up,
he commits the crime,

00:21:34,763 --> 00:21:35,897
he drives down
to the Strip

00:21:35,964 --> 00:21:37,332
and he checks into
the Tangiers.

00:21:37,399 --> 00:21:38,467
The Gift Show's in town.

00:21:38,533 --> 00:21:40,469
There aren't any
vacancies on the Strip.

00:21:40,535 --> 00:21:43,271
Well, his wife said that she
hadn't seen him in a few days.

00:21:43,338 --> 00:21:44,940
Maybe he's back
in the game again,

00:21:45,006 --> 00:21:47,075
selling coke
to out-of-town businessmen

00:21:47,142 --> 00:21:49,745
from the comfort and security
of his hotel room.

00:21:49,811 --> 00:21:51,847
So, he takes a break
from his job,

00:21:51,913 --> 00:21:54,416
rapes and kills the vic
at another hotel,

00:21:54,483 --> 00:21:56,184
and then goes back to work?

00:21:56,251 --> 00:21:59,488
Even cokeheads need
a diversion now and then.

00:22:01,056 --> 00:22:03,558
Hi, Stokes.
Solve the case?

00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:05,627
( <i>chuckles</i> ):
I'm getting there.

00:22:05,694 --> 00:22:07,496
Nothing definitive
as of yet.

00:22:07,562 --> 00:22:09,097
Which means
you can't hold Matt Hawkins

00:22:09,164 --> 00:22:10,399
for longer than his 24 hours.

00:22:10,465 --> 00:22:12,567
Really? Well, you know, uh...

00:22:12,634 --> 00:22:14,069
I got a signed confession.

00:22:14,136 --> 00:22:16,071
Really?
Mm-hmm.

00:22:16,138 --> 00:22:17,639
Sort of kicks the crap

00:22:17,706 --> 00:22:19,441
out of your "evidence,"
now, doesn't it?

00:22:19,508 --> 00:22:20,942
He confessed?
Signed.
Check it.

00:22:21,009 --> 00:22:22,711
Did you beat it
out of him?

00:22:22,778 --> 00:22:25,047
( <i>chuckles</i> ):
No, I used science,
kind of like you guys.

00:22:25,113 --> 00:22:26,381
Mm, how's that?

00:22:26,448 --> 00:22:28,617
I put him on a Computer
Voice Stress Analyzer.

00:22:28,683 --> 00:22:31,653
Once I caught him lying,
he gave it right up.

00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,456
That device has been
discredited for years.

00:22:34,523 --> 00:22:36,224
Well, check their Web site.

00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:39,628
It's still used in 1,400
state and local agencies.

00:22:39,694 --> 00:22:40,962
Well, not in Las Vegas.

00:22:41,029 --> 00:22:42,831
Or anywhere else
in this state.

00:22:42,898 --> 00:22:46,134
Say, was an advocate
or a parent present

00:22:46,201 --> 00:22:48,136
at the time of
the confession?

00:22:48,203 --> 00:22:49,938
He didn't ask
for his mommy and daddy.

00:22:50,005 --> 00:22:51,973
Long as he says
he understands his rights,

00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,042
we don't have to have
anyone there with him.

00:22:54,109 --> 00:22:56,166
He tell you <i>why</i> he did it?

00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:58,836
No, but he will.

00:22:58,902 --> 00:23:01,004
Hey, listen, Stokes,

00:23:01,071 --> 00:23:03,640
thanks for trying to help,
but we got him.

00:23:04,708 --> 00:23:06,844
Okay.

00:23:08,792 --> 00:23:10,750
So, I just got back
from the Tangiers.

00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:13,417
The GM won't let us
into Jesse Acheson's room

00:23:13,417 --> 00:23:14,518
without a search warrant,

00:23:14,585 --> 00:23:15,986
and the judge denied
our request.

00:23:16,053 --> 00:23:17,321
I'll talk to the judge.

00:23:17,388 --> 00:23:19,390
I'll bring Acheson in
for questioning, I guess.

00:23:19,456 --> 00:23:21,692
Could you just keep him
under surveillance for now,

00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:23,160
let Greg tag along
with your guy?

00:23:23,227 --> 00:23:24,428
We might learn something.

00:23:24,495 --> 00:23:27,064
Sure, I'll get him
a bag of donuts.

00:23:27,131 --> 00:23:30,267
I was testifying today.

00:23:30,334 --> 00:23:31,602
I ran into the D.A.

00:23:31,669 --> 00:23:34,138
He filled me in
on your case.

00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:36,640
Looks like
Matt Hawkins' confession

00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:38,642
is gonna stand up in court.

00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:41,545
Suspects are tricked
into confessing all the time,

00:23:41,612 --> 00:23:44,648
but I'm telling you,
Cavaliere intimidated that boy.

00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:46,650
Man, he would've signed
anything.

00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:47,985
So you think he's innocent?

00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:49,687
Could be. I checked
the crime stats

00:23:49,753 --> 00:23:51,255
for the Hawkins neighborhood.

00:23:51,322 --> 00:23:53,324
There's been a rash
of nuisance calls.

00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,526
There's some homeless guy
running around out there

00:23:55,592 --> 00:23:57,995
peeping in windows, urinating
in public, attempted B and E.

00:23:58,062 --> 00:23:59,863
Sounds like a suspect.

00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:01,265
I'm gonna go back out there,

00:24:01,332 --> 00:24:03,233
see if the Hawkins know
anything about it.

00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,202
Need some help?

00:24:05,269 --> 00:24:06,537
You got that kind of time?

00:24:06,603 --> 00:24:08,305
I'll meet you in the car.

00:24:08,372 --> 00:24:09,840
Thanks, Warrick.

00:24:09,907 --> 00:24:11,675
WOMAN:
<i>You expect me</i>

00:24:11,742 --> 00:24:13,444
to invade Mr. Acheson's privacy

00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:15,646
based upon
a five-year-old fingerprint

00:24:15,713 --> 00:24:17,348
that was manipulated
on a computer?

00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:19,383
It wasn't manipulated--
it was processed.

00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:23,053
That's what we do.
Try getting that one
past a defense attorney.

00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,255
It's one thing to send
a print through AFIS;

00:24:25,322 --> 00:24:27,057
it's another thing to use...

00:24:27,124 --> 00:24:29,994
a "background
subtraction algorithm"
to isolate the print

00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:32,763
from a bedspread.
It's not <i>my</i> fault
that the courts

00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:34,665
lag behind our technology.
Gil,

00:24:34,732 --> 00:24:36,133
I'm sympathetic
to your request,

00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,135
but if I grant a warrant
based upon this print,

00:24:38,202 --> 00:24:39,970
and the print is later
thrown out of court,

00:24:40,037 --> 00:24:43,707
then everything you
find as a result of it
would be excluded,

00:24:43,774 --> 00:24:46,043
and your pattern rapist
could be back on the street.

00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,778
Give me something else--
I'll be happy

00:24:47,845 --> 00:24:49,413
to grant you a warrant.
Your Honor,

00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,882
I need the warrant
in order to find something else.

00:24:51,949 --> 00:24:54,418
You'll find another way.

00:25:02,092 --> 00:25:04,028
Kind of like bird-watching,
ain't it?

00:25:04,094 --> 00:25:06,930
I wouldn't know.

00:25:06,997 --> 00:25:08,599
You bored?

00:25:08,666 --> 00:25:10,701
( <i>sighs</i> ):
I'm bored.

00:25:10,768 --> 00:25:12,569
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:14,038
So, I got a question.

00:25:14,104 --> 00:25:16,907
I hear the killer completely
wiped down the crime scene.

00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:19,276
So why do you think
he left his semen behind?

00:25:19,343 --> 00:25:20,744
Could've worn a condom.

00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:24,815
Well, before committing a crime,
a typical serial rapist

00:25:24,882 --> 00:25:29,053
will often masturbate to his
perfect rape-murder fantasy.

00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:32,523
Didn't wear a condom then,

00:25:32,589 --> 00:25:35,125
didn't want to wear one
during the act.

00:25:35,192 --> 00:25:36,927
Besides, the DNA isn't on file.

00:25:36,994 --> 00:25:38,729
It wasn't much of a risk.

00:25:44,201 --> 00:25:45,636
Litterbug.

00:25:45,703 --> 00:25:49,239
CSIs don't mind the bugs.

00:25:52,242 --> 00:25:56,013
If the DNA on this cup
matches the seminal DNA,

00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,048
Grissom won't need a warrant.

00:25:58,115 --> 00:26:00,184
We'll be making an arrest.

00:26:04,355 --> 00:26:06,490
We're not unfit parents.

00:26:06,557 --> 00:26:09,827
Please, we just want
to speak with our son.

00:26:09,893 --> 00:26:11,328
We called the detective,

00:26:11,395 --> 00:26:13,464
but no one will
tell us anything.

00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:16,033
Right now your son's
under investigation.

00:26:17,067 --> 00:26:19,570
What?
Yeah, the detective
asked him

00:26:19,637 --> 00:26:22,506
if he wanted a parent
or advocate present
at the interrogation.

00:26:22,573 --> 00:26:25,809
He's 14 years old,
so it's his right to say no.

00:26:25,876 --> 00:26:27,077
But he's just a kid.

00:26:27,144 --> 00:26:28,946
I mean,
he just lost his brother.

00:26:29,013 --> 00:26:30,481
YVONNE:
Matt's sensitive.

00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:31,915
He doesn't handle stress well.

00:26:31,982 --> 00:26:33,550
If we-we-we could
just talk to him.

00:26:33,617 --> 00:26:35,285
He may need
a change of clothes.

00:26:36,754 --> 00:26:38,522
Were those his clothes
in the washer?

00:26:38,589 --> 00:26:40,291
Yeah.

00:26:40,357 --> 00:26:42,626
Okay, we'll see what we can do
about getting him

00:26:42,693 --> 00:26:44,361
something to wear.
In the meantime,

00:26:44,428 --> 00:26:46,196
if you could just
answer the question.

00:26:46,263 --> 00:26:49,933
You want to know
about that homeless guy?

00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,468
Yeah.
He's nuts.

00:26:51,535 --> 00:26:54,004
He-he scared the boys
once or twice, but...

00:26:54,071 --> 00:26:55,472
How did he scare them?

00:26:55,539 --> 00:26:57,341
Ty saw him writing
something on the window.

00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:58,942
Was it "Brat"?

00:26:59,009 --> 00:26:59,943
Yeah.

00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:01,945
I chased him away.

00:27:02,012 --> 00:27:03,113
Matt...

00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,181
cleaned off the window.

00:27:04,248 --> 00:27:05,849
That would explain
the shoe impressions

00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:07,117
outside the bedroom window.

00:27:07,184 --> 00:27:08,419
You're thinking
that that guy

00:27:08,485 --> 00:27:10,187
had something to do
with what happened?

00:27:10,254 --> 00:27:12,556
Well, that's what
we're trying to find out.

00:27:12,623 --> 00:27:15,292
( <i>crying</i> ):
Oh, God. I knew
we should've called the cops.

00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:16,994
When was the last time
that you saw him?

00:27:17,061 --> 00:27:18,996
MARTIN:
I jog through that
park every evening.

00:27:19,063 --> 00:27:22,366
Um, he's got this, uh...

00:27:22,433 --> 00:27:24,568
makeshift tent thing

00:27:24,635 --> 00:27:27,171
set up by the
playground.

00:27:27,237 --> 00:27:29,907
( <i>crickets chirping</i> )

00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:37,247
What? Hey! Stop it!
Come on!

00:27:37,314 --> 00:27:38,916
Get up!
Let me...
let me go!

00:27:38,983 --> 00:27:41,986
( <i>grunts):</i>
Let go of me! Stop it!

00:27:42,052 --> 00:27:43,821
Hey, what's
your name?
What?

00:27:43,887 --> 00:27:45,556
Tell the gentlemen
your name.

00:27:45,623 --> 00:27:48,592
Walter! My name is Walter!

00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:50,027
Walter, that's
a nice blue sweater.

00:27:50,094 --> 00:27:51,061
Where'd you get it?

00:27:51,128 --> 00:27:52,196
What?
I said I like

00:27:52,262 --> 00:27:53,731
your sweater--
where'd you get it?

00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:55,332
It's mine!
Oh, it's yours?

00:27:55,399 --> 00:27:57,101
Yes, this is my sweater!

00:27:57,167 --> 00:27:58,902
Whose blood is it
on your sweater, Walter?

00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:00,270
We're gonna give you
a nice warm place

00:28:00,337 --> 00:28:01,672
to sleep tonight, partner.

00:28:01,739 --> 00:28:03,073
STOKES:
Suspicion of murder.

00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,542
WALTER:
No! No!

00:28:05,609 --> 00:28:07,044
( <i>screaming</i> )
Easy with

00:28:07,111 --> 00:28:08,212
the sweater.

00:28:08,278 --> 00:28:10,547
It's evidence.

00:28:10,614 --> 00:28:13,117
So, I processed the DNA
from the coffee cup,

00:28:13,183 --> 00:28:15,219
and it turns out
that there were <i>two</i>

00:28:15,285 --> 00:28:17,721
contributions on the
lip, which means that

00:28:17,788 --> 00:28:20,357
your coffee shop recycles,
and not in the good way.

00:28:20,424 --> 00:28:21,392
Gross.

00:28:21,458 --> 00:28:22,426
Bad news

00:28:22,493 --> 00:28:24,061
is that neither
of the contributions

00:28:24,128 --> 00:28:25,362
is consistent with the semen

00:28:25,429 --> 00:28:27,197
that was recovered
from the crime scene.

00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:29,833
If Acheson didn't
rape Sue Stein,

00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:32,703
what is his print doing
on the bedspread?

00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:35,239
Well, I certainly
didn't kill anyone, and...

00:28:35,306 --> 00:28:37,574
I do not know
how my fingerprint got there.

00:28:37,641 --> 00:28:38,909
We don't think

00:28:38,976 --> 00:28:40,878
that you did rape
or kill anyone.

00:28:40,944 --> 00:28:43,347
We simply want to know
how your fingerprint

00:28:43,414 --> 00:28:45,816
ended up at a murder
scene five years ago.

00:28:45,883 --> 00:28:47,351
Look, Jesse,
we appreciate

00:28:47,418 --> 00:28:49,386
you coming down here
voluntarily,

00:28:49,453 --> 00:28:51,055
but if you clam up,

00:28:51,121 --> 00:28:55,259
we're gonna have to file an
obstruction of justice charge,

00:28:55,326 --> 00:28:57,661
and that's not good...
for you.

00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:59,663
Let's make it easy
on yourself.

00:29:01,332 --> 00:29:04,768
What were you doing
in Sue Stein's hotel room?

00:29:06,403 --> 00:29:08,439
You won't believe me.

00:29:08,505 --> 00:29:10,507
BRASS:
Try us.

00:29:12,176 --> 00:29:15,112
I did go to see Sue
that night.

00:29:15,179 --> 00:29:17,982
( <i>whispers</i> ):
Sue.

00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:19,883
Come on, girl, wake up.

00:29:27,491 --> 00:29:29,593
You just took off?

00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:32,096
You didn't bother
to report a murder?

00:29:32,162 --> 00:29:35,699
Ma'am, I... I got a record,

00:29:35,766 --> 00:29:37,668
and I was on probation.

00:29:37,735 --> 00:29:40,571
If I'd done all of that,
I'd have been...

00:29:40,638 --> 00:29:42,206
suspect numero uno.

00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,774
BRASS:
All right,
let's cut to the chase.

00:29:43,841 --> 00:29:46,677
You were there
to sell her blow, right?

00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:52,049
I don't need a lawyer, right?

00:29:52,116 --> 00:29:53,951
I mean, it's off the record?

00:29:54,018 --> 00:29:56,620
We're just having
a little chat here.

00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:02,693
That's why she left
the door unlocked.

00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,362
We'd been doing it that way
for years.

00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:07,564
Whenever Sue came to town,

00:30:07,631 --> 00:30:10,334
I always took care of her.

00:30:14,972 --> 00:30:17,007
I'm really sorry.

00:30:18,409 --> 00:30:21,545
She was my friend.

00:30:21,612 --> 00:30:24,148
I wish I could be more help.

00:30:27,384 --> 00:30:29,486
Stokes.
Hey, man.

00:30:29,553 --> 00:30:31,322
What the hell
are you doing?

00:30:31,388 --> 00:30:33,724
Are you trying
to screw with my case?
I'm just following

00:30:33,791 --> 00:30:35,592
the evidence,
and it led me to
another suspect.

00:30:35,659 --> 00:30:37,294
I think you're gonna
want to talk to him

00:30:37,361 --> 00:30:38,529
in the interest
of justice.

00:30:38,595 --> 00:30:40,764
What, are you trying
to help the defense now?

00:30:40,831 --> 00:30:42,533
You know any good defense
is gonna bring up

00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:44,001
a "rush to judgment"
here. Come on!

00:30:44,068 --> 00:30:46,236
Chris, you put another
interviewed suspect
on your list.

00:30:46,303 --> 00:30:48,772
It shows due diligence.

00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:50,207
Let's go.

00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:55,713
Your sweater's been analyzed,
Walter.

00:30:55,779 --> 00:30:58,515
Found bloodstains from
a murdered boy on it.

00:30:58,582 --> 00:31:00,584
It's not my sweater.

00:31:00,651 --> 00:31:03,420
You already told me
it <i>was</i> yours.

00:31:03,487 --> 00:31:05,389
Finders keepers.

00:31:05,456 --> 00:31:07,424
It wasn't always
mine, though.

00:31:07,491 --> 00:31:10,227
Where did you find it?
On a bench.

00:31:10,294 --> 00:31:12,463
By the basketball courts.

00:31:14,431 --> 00:31:17,201
( <i>dog barking</i> )

00:31:18,469 --> 00:31:20,571
I was cold.

00:31:20,638 --> 00:31:21,839
Hey, man...

00:31:21,905 --> 00:31:24,241
if you're lying...

00:31:24,308 --> 00:31:25,743
I'm not lying.

00:31:27,011 --> 00:31:28,646
I'm not lying!

00:31:28,712 --> 00:31:30,981
So when did you find it?

00:31:31,208 --> 00:31:32,409
Yesterday.

00:31:32,476 --> 00:31:34,778
No, um, a few days ago.

00:31:36,613 --> 00:31:38,615
I don't remember.

00:31:38,682 --> 00:31:40,751
Put him in lockup--
maybe it'll help
his memory.

00:31:47,375 --> 00:31:49,477
Stokes...

00:31:49,544 --> 00:31:51,379
I got a signed confession.

00:31:51,446 --> 00:31:53,215
You got a bum
in a bloody sweater.

00:31:53,281 --> 00:31:56,585
What are you gonna do
about it?

00:32:28,291 --> 00:32:29,526
Hey, Catherine.
Yeah?

00:32:29,592 --> 00:32:31,995
DNA finished up with the blue
sweater and I processed it.

00:32:32,062 --> 00:32:32,996
Anything probative?

00:32:33,063 --> 00:32:34,597
I ran it under the UV light

00:32:34,664 --> 00:32:36,232
and out popped one
of those invisible

00:32:36,299 --> 00:32:37,667
dry cleaner
ID stamps, you know?

00:32:37,734 --> 00:32:38,768
Yeah?

00:32:38,835 --> 00:32:41,171
I called the dry cleaner,
they gave me a name.

00:32:41,237 --> 00:32:44,674
Mr. Hawkins,
is that your sweater?

00:32:47,143 --> 00:32:48,244
Yeah...

00:32:48,311 --> 00:32:49,846
it looks like
my sweater.

00:32:49,913 --> 00:32:50,914
Where'd you find it?

00:32:50,981 --> 00:32:52,449
Did you give it away?

00:32:52,515 --> 00:32:55,185
No, but I haven't seen it
n a while, though. Why?

00:32:55,251 --> 00:32:58,121
It's got Ty's blood on it.

00:33:01,458 --> 00:33:04,327
Do I need a lawyer?

00:33:04,394 --> 00:33:06,262
That's your call, sir.

00:33:13,792 --> 00:33:14,709
You called me?

00:33:14,709 --> 00:33:16,511
Yeah, Mia sent me
that wad of hair

00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:18,346
that you pulled out
of the hotel drain.

00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:20,548
It's coated in bleach.

00:33:20,615 --> 00:33:23,084
I'm thinking the killer must've
poured the stuff down the drain.

00:33:23,151 --> 00:33:24,953
Really compromised the trace.

00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:28,223
That's it?
A compromised wad of hair?

00:33:28,289 --> 00:33:30,458
No, uh, I called you
to discuss the bleach.

00:33:30,525 --> 00:33:33,561
The hairy wad smelled
a bit woodsy to me.

00:33:33,628 --> 00:33:35,230
Which is odd,
considering

00:33:35,296 --> 00:33:37,298
it should only
smell like bleach.

00:33:37,365 --> 00:33:39,134
You sniffed it?

00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,935
That disgust you?

00:33:41,002 --> 00:33:42,203
No, actually,
it's the first time

00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,705
you've ever done
anything to impress me.

00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:48,209
Anyway, um,
I analyzed the bleach.

00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:49,711
It contains

00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:50,712
a cedar additive.

00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:52,080
Thought you'd want to know.

00:33:52,147 --> 00:33:53,166
Thanks, David.

00:33:53,166 --> 00:33:54,568
Sure, Gil.

00:33:59,208 --> 00:34:00,625
MAN:
I'm more than happy to help you

00:34:00,625 --> 00:34:01,583
in any way I can.

00:34:01,583 --> 00:34:04,583
So when I got your phone call
about the scent of our bleach.

00:34:04,583 --> 00:34:06,351
I figured you should
to talk to Lucy.

00:34:06,418 --> 00:34:08,587
Lucy is our
head of housekeeping.

00:34:09,083 --> 00:34:10,885
The guests sometimes complained

00:34:10,952 --> 00:34:13,454
about the bleach smell
after we cleaned the bathrooms.

00:34:13,521 --> 00:34:14,722
A few years ago,

00:34:14,789 --> 00:34:16,891
I started adding
cedar chips to the bottles.

00:34:16,958 --> 00:34:19,327
Makes it
smell better.

00:34:19,394 --> 00:34:21,629
Lucy, who else has access
to your bleach?

00:34:21,696 --> 00:34:23,131
Just the maids.

00:34:23,197 --> 00:34:24,365
Are they all female?

00:34:24,432 --> 00:34:25,333
Yes.

00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,467
You park your carts

00:34:26,534 --> 00:34:28,536
in the hallway when
you clean the room,

00:34:28,603 --> 00:34:30,905
so anyone could have swiped
a bottle of bleach, right?

00:34:30,972 --> 00:34:34,309
LUCY:
No. We've had
problems with theft,

00:34:34,375 --> 00:34:36,344
towels mainly,
but now our maids

00:34:36,411 --> 00:34:38,680
take their carts into the rooms.

00:34:38,746 --> 00:34:40,248
Those your kids?

00:34:40,315 --> 00:34:42,717
Yeah.

00:34:42,784 --> 00:34:44,619
Two eldest
are at UNLV.

00:34:44,686 --> 00:34:46,854
And the baby?
Jake.

00:34:46,921 --> 00:34:48,556
Jake is, uh, six months old.

00:34:50,358 --> 00:34:51,793
Is that your second wife?

00:34:51,859 --> 00:34:52,727
Mm-hmm.

00:34:52,794 --> 00:34:54,195
So you must
have had

00:34:54,262 --> 00:34:56,230
your vasectomy reversed.

00:34:56,297 --> 00:35:01,336
Why are we talking
about my vasectomy?

00:35:01,402 --> 00:35:03,271
You also
have access to the bleach,

00:35:03,338 --> 00:35:05,707
so you won't mind
if I take a DNA sample.

00:35:05,773 --> 00:35:09,544
Look.

00:35:09,611 --> 00:35:11,646
If word leaks out

00:35:11,713 --> 00:35:15,516
that you took my DNA
and I'm a murder suspect,

00:35:15,583 --> 00:35:19,554
I will never work
in hospitality again.

00:35:19,621 --> 00:35:21,155
I'm sorry, the answer's no.

00:35:21,222 --> 00:35:23,124
Anything else?

00:35:23,191 --> 00:35:25,460
We'll be in touch.

00:35:25,526 --> 00:35:27,862
So we've got three
suspects, three scenarios.

00:35:27,929 --> 00:35:31,566
Yeah, Matt could have worn his
Dad's sweater when he killed Ty.

00:35:31,633 --> 00:35:33,935
Dumped it in the park
during the night,

00:35:34,002 --> 00:35:35,336
where Walter found it.

00:35:35,403 --> 00:35:38,373
Or Dad could have worn it
and dumped it in the park.

00:35:38,439 --> 00:35:39,807
Or this sweater
could have accidentally

00:35:39,874 --> 00:35:42,143
been left in the park,
and Walter, the homeless guy,

00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:43,945
could have
picked it up and worn it

00:35:44,012 --> 00:35:45,380
when he entered
the house

00:35:45,446 --> 00:35:47,515
through the screen
door and killed Ty.

00:35:47,582 --> 00:35:49,484
But none of the evidence
goes to motive.

00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:50,952
Not our problem
at the moment.

00:35:51,019 --> 00:35:52,920
Let's just stay
focused on the sweater.

00:35:52,987 --> 00:35:56,224
It's tied
to the victim and this scene.

00:35:56,291 --> 00:35:58,359
We need to tie
it to the killer.

00:35:58,426 --> 00:36:00,628
Hey, how tall
would you say Matt Hawkins?

00:36:00,695 --> 00:36:04,032
About five feet, why?

00:36:04,098 --> 00:36:05,366
Dad is... 6'2".

00:36:05,433 --> 00:36:07,101
What about Walter?

00:36:07,168 --> 00:36:10,138
Mmm... 5'10".
About Nick's height.

00:36:10,204 --> 00:36:11,739
What you getting at?

00:36:11,806 --> 00:36:14,309
Meet me in the garage
in half an hour.

00:36:17,111 --> 00:36:20,648
GRISSOM:
Mr. Michaels, in my work
over the last 25 years,

00:36:20,715 --> 00:36:23,618
I've come to understand
the kind of person

00:36:23,685 --> 00:36:26,254
who's a rapist-killer.

00:36:26,321 --> 00:36:27,555
Is that an accusation?

00:36:27,622 --> 00:36:28,957
Well, a woman
was murdered

00:36:29,023 --> 00:36:30,091
in your client's hotel.

00:36:30,158 --> 00:36:32,460
He has a right
to hear our theory.

00:36:32,527 --> 00:36:34,429
The killer

00:36:34,495 --> 00:36:35,863
is clearly a psychopath.

00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:37,765
He's killed more than once.

00:36:37,832 --> 00:36:41,035
I'm sure that before
his first rape and murder

00:36:41,102 --> 00:36:43,571
he fantasized about
it for years.

00:36:46,507 --> 00:36:47,675
( <i>muffled screams</i> )

00:36:47,742 --> 00:36:49,110
Quiet!
Quiet!

00:36:51,312 --> 00:36:55,783
During that time, he engaged
in behavioral tryouts.

00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:57,385
Stalking women
and attempting

00:36:57,452 --> 00:37:00,822
to coerce them
sexually, each time

00:37:00,888 --> 00:37:03,491
moving closer and closer
to the actual event.

00:37:03,558 --> 00:37:06,194
( <i>crying</i> )
Shut up!

00:37:09,897 --> 00:37:12,033
I believe
that after

00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:14,102
you consummated
your first attack,

00:37:14,168 --> 00:37:18,439
you felt excitement
greater than you anticipated.

00:37:18,506 --> 00:37:21,876
Your only regret was that
she died too quickly.

00:37:27,415 --> 00:37:30,151
But you took solace
in the knowledge that, uh,

00:37:30,218 --> 00:37:31,886
you could do it again.

00:37:31,953 --> 00:37:34,188
In fact, your
subsequent victim

00:37:34,255 --> 00:37:38,192
had similar characteristics
to your first victim.

00:37:38,259 --> 00:37:40,428
No! No! No!

00:37:40,495 --> 00:37:43,898
Shut up!
Shut up!

00:37:49,938 --> 00:37:51,839
This is a waste of time.

00:37:51,906 --> 00:37:53,441
You see, what
differentiates a psychopath

00:37:53,508 --> 00:37:55,276
from a "heat
of the moment" killer

00:37:55,343 --> 00:37:57,478
is forethought.

00:38:03,952 --> 00:38:06,321
And you thought
about this for a long time.

00:38:06,387 --> 00:38:08,389
Thank you for
the fascinating seminar,

00:38:08,456 --> 00:38:10,158
but you have
no evidence,

00:38:10,224 --> 00:38:11,859
so we are free
to go.

00:38:11,926 --> 00:38:14,095
Actually, I have some evidence.

00:38:15,897 --> 00:38:17,365
What is this?
What's going on?

00:38:20,468 --> 00:38:22,203
Mr. Michaels?

00:38:23,671 --> 00:38:26,007
She can't... You can't do that.

00:38:26,074 --> 00:38:27,008
Do what?

00:38:27,075 --> 00:38:28,142
No, I know my rights.

00:38:28,209 --> 00:38:28,743
Hey, shh.

00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:30,178
The bitch broke into my car.

00:38:33,948 --> 00:38:36,918
I don't remember
seeing a warrant, Ms. Sidle.

00:38:36,985 --> 00:38:38,419
I don't have a warrant.

00:38:38,486 --> 00:38:40,021
I was following a hunch.

00:38:40,088 --> 00:38:42,090
Well, then you
just set my client free.

00:38:42,156 --> 00:38:43,091
On the contrary.

00:38:43,157 --> 00:38:45,727
Western Airlines
issues this exact

00:38:45,793 --> 00:38:47,895
type of "wheelie" to all
its flight attendants.

00:38:47,962 --> 00:38:50,398
Since Martha's
wheelie wasn't in

00:38:50,465 --> 00:38:53,201
the hotel room, we thought
maybe the killer took it...

00:38:53,268 --> 00:38:55,069
as a souvenir.

00:38:55,136 --> 00:38:56,437
This particular

00:38:56,504 --> 00:38:57,905
suit case...

00:38:57,972 --> 00:38:59,941
( <i>unzipping</i> )

00:39:01,843 --> 00:39:05,780
...is not Martha's
wheelie.

00:39:05,847 --> 00:39:08,750
GRISSOM:
And now that we
know where to find it,

00:39:08,816 --> 00:39:13,154
and we have your client on tape,
I bet you

00:39:13,221 --> 00:39:15,156
we'll get
a warrant.

00:39:15,223 --> 00:39:17,625
Thank you.

00:39:21,496 --> 00:39:25,800
CATHERINE:
Okay, Warrick,

00:39:25,867 --> 00:39:29,037
you are approximately
the height of Martin Hawkins.

00:39:29,103 --> 00:39:32,640
Nick, you and the homeless
dude are about the same,

00:39:32,707 --> 00:39:35,276
and Judy, you're close to Matt.

00:39:35,343 --> 00:39:38,880
The table
is the same height

00:39:38,947 --> 00:39:41,182
as Ty's bed-- 43 and half inches

00:39:41,249 --> 00:39:43,251
from the floor
to the top of the mattress.

00:39:43,318 --> 00:39:46,654
The white sweaters, which you
all look so adorable in,

00:39:46,721 --> 00:39:49,157
are the same fabric
as the bloody one.

00:39:49,223 --> 00:39:52,627
The pipes

00:39:52,694 --> 00:39:55,496
are the same
diameter

00:39:55,563 --> 00:39:58,900
as the wounds on Ty's face.

00:39:58,967 --> 00:40:04,439
I want each of you
to take a whack at our victim.

00:40:04,505 --> 00:40:05,506
Just like
Chuckie Cheese.

00:40:05,573 --> 00:40:06,608
Whack-a-Mole.

00:40:06,674 --> 00:40:07,709
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:40:07,775 --> 00:40:09,243
Uh, spatter up.

00:41:08,603 --> 00:41:09,537
Judy,

00:41:09,604 --> 00:41:13,908
your sweater-- killer.

00:41:13,975 --> 00:41:17,245
Like I told him, I did it.

00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:21,182
You want a medal for figuring
out what I already said?

00:41:21,249 --> 00:41:24,352
CAVALIERE:
You never told me why.

00:41:24,419 --> 00:41:26,220
Why's it matter, anyways?

00:41:26,287 --> 00:41:31,626
( <i>crying</i> )

00:41:33,828 --> 00:41:35,797
Go ahead.

00:41:46,474 --> 00:41:49,444
Dad.

00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:52,780
I want to know why.

00:41:52,847 --> 00:41:53,982
Dad...
Why?

00:41:54,048 --> 00:41:55,917
Damn it.

00:41:55,984 --> 00:41:59,354
Ty looked up to you.

00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:03,591
He... he loved you.

00:42:03,658 --> 00:42:07,595
He told.
He told everyone!

00:42:10,031 --> 00:42:11,165
That you wet the bed?

00:42:11,232 --> 00:42:13,101
Shut up!

00:42:24,312 --> 00:42:28,683
( <i>crying</i> ):
Dad... I'm sorry. I...

00:42:46,567 --> 00:42:47,969
( <i>crying</i> ):
Oh, Matthew...

00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,441
Hey.

00:42:55,576 --> 00:42:57,578
You owe me an apology.

00:42:57,645 --> 00:43:00,315
I'm sorry...

00:43:01,667 --> 00:43:03,500
that you feel that way.
