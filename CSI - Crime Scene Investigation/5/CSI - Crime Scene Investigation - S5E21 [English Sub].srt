00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:10,526
We have two types
of patients here:

00:02:10,593 --> 00:02:13,028
the criminally insane
and sexually violent predators,

00:02:13,095 --> 00:02:15,130
all with multiple
convictions.

00:02:15,197 --> 00:02:18,500
We get all the inmates
the prisons can't handle.

00:02:18,567 --> 00:02:22,071
Keep your kits closed
and locked when not in use.

00:02:22,137 --> 00:02:23,739
Um, Ms. Sidle, best
if you remove the vest.

00:02:23,806 --> 00:02:27,343
New uniforms
upset them.

00:02:32,748 --> 00:02:34,683
We're mostly concerned

00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,220
with maintaining
psychiatric remission.

00:02:38,287 --> 00:02:40,556
We want to stabilize
symptoms

00:02:40,623 --> 00:02:43,359
and reduce an individual's risk
of violence to himself

00:02:43,425 --> 00:02:45,427
and to others.

00:02:45,494 --> 00:02:47,429
Oh, uh, could
actually stop here

00:02:47,496 --> 00:02:50,332
and put your backs
against the wall, please.

00:02:50,399 --> 00:02:52,501

This is Captain Brass.

00:03:14,056 --> 00:03:18,027
Dr. Grissom and Ms. Sidle
are from the Crime Lab.

00:03:18,093 --> 00:03:19,862
Lt. Reed Owens,
Desert State Hospital Police.

00:03:19,929 --> 00:03:21,730
We have our own
internal police team

00:03:21,797 --> 00:03:24,466
and Lieutenant Owens was
the first officer on the scene

00:03:24,533 --> 00:03:25,467
after the call came in.

00:03:25,534 --> 00:03:27,336
The victim was found
by Nurse Faber

00:03:27,403 --> 00:03:28,571
at approximately 12:10 a.m.

00:03:28,637 --> 00:03:31,407
Joanne was coming off shift,

00:03:33,175 --> 00:03:34,543
I found Robbie on the floor.

00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:35,544
Kenny was in the corner

00:03:35,611 --> 00:03:37,279
covered in blood.

00:03:37,346 --> 00:03:39,882
Are the patients locked in
their rooms at night?

00:03:39,949 --> 00:03:41,350
No. The doors
are left unlocked.

00:03:41,417 --> 00:03:44,753
BRASS:
So they're free
to roam around?

00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,055
Locked rooms usually lead

00:03:46,121 --> 00:03:48,090
to patients trying
to harm themselves.

00:03:48,157 --> 00:03:49,892
BRASS:
Where's Kenny now?

00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:51,527
He's been taken to seclusion.

Leon, let's get a couple

of Lorazepam into him.

00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,675
How did he get
those wounds?

00:04:06,742 --> 00:04:07,810
Oh, Kenny's a self-mutilator.

00:04:07,876 --> 00:04:09,111
He suffers
from Renfield's Syndrome;

00:04:09,178 --> 00:04:10,546

00:04:10,613 --> 00:04:11,747
Shh...

00:04:11,814 --> 00:04:15,351
Couple of weeks ago
I caught him gouging
himself

00:04:15,417 --> 00:04:17,386
with a carpet staple.

00:04:17,453 --> 00:04:20,356
He was wearing these clothes
when you found him?

00:04:20,422 --> 00:04:21,624
Yes.

00:04:27,229 --> 00:04:30,966
There was blood spatter
all over the victim's room.

00:04:31,033 --> 00:04:33,535
Blood but no spatter
on Kenny's clothes.

His brain tells him

He has no reason
to doubt it.

00:05:40,921 --> 00:05:42,055
Or any desire to.

00:05:42,122 --> 00:05:43,957
GRISSOM:
They asked John Nash
how he could believe

00:05:44,024 --> 00:05:46,293
that extraterrestrials
were sending him messages.

00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,629
He said that the messages
came to him

00:05:49,696 --> 00:05:52,566
in the same way that his
mathematical ideas did.

00:05:52,632 --> 00:05:54,668
So he had to take them
seriously.

00:05:54,735 --> 00:05:56,903
Hey.

00:05:59,673 --> 00:06:00,741
Yeah.

00:06:00,807 --> 00:06:02,042
The administration asked me

00:06:02,109 --> 00:06:03,343
to set up some rooms
for your interviews,

00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:04,344
but, uh, personally,

00:06:04,411 --> 00:06:05,746
I don't see what you hope
to accomplish.

00:06:05,812 --> 00:06:07,147
These patients are criminals

00:06:07,214 --> 00:06:08,615
with severe mental disorders.

00:06:08,682 --> 00:06:10,984
They're not going
to give you a straight answer.

I heard him say it.

00:07:23,123 --> 00:07:24,624
And it's not like
he isn't serious.

00:07:28,562 --> 00:07:30,030
Who isn't serious?

00:07:35,068 --> 00:07:38,638
Can you tell me anything else
about him?

00:07:38,705 --> 00:07:40,841
Oh, no, I couldn't.

No. My name is Ronald.

What's his name?

00:07:57,991 --> 00:07:59,426
He doesn't have a name.

00:07:59,493 --> 00:08:01,661
He's a cricket.

00:08:01,728 --> 00:08:03,363
Here.

00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,965
A cricket?

who did it,

00:09:30,117 --> 00:09:32,152
Are you going to convict me
of murder

00:09:32,219 --> 00:09:33,687
and put me in a bad place?

They foretold this
into some ready child,

And the crazy frickin' jewboy

You know, most of the doctors

What can I help you with?

00:11:14,955 --> 00:11:17,391
Question about the victim.

00:11:17,457 --> 00:11:20,293
I have heard that
in some cases

00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,430
of deviant sexual
predisposition,

00:11:23,497 --> 00:11:24,664
you slow the sex drive...

00:11:24,731 --> 00:11:26,833
If you're talking
about chemical castration,

00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,402
the answer is, yes, Robbie was.

00:11:28,468 --> 00:11:31,304
So he didn't masturbate.

00:11:31,371 --> 00:11:32,906
Masturbate, yes.

00:11:32,973 --> 00:11:34,307
Ejaculate, no.

00:11:34,374 --> 00:11:37,711
So the semen that I found
on his bed is someone else's?

00:11:37,778 --> 00:11:39,379
Likely.

00:11:39,446 --> 00:11:41,081
Thanks.

00:11:41,148 --> 00:11:43,717
Sure.

Hey, guys, I found semen
in the victim's room

00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,822
and it's probably
not his.

00:11:48,889 --> 00:11:50,891
He was chemically
castrated.

00:11:50,957 --> 00:11:52,025
So you're thinking

00:11:52,092 --> 00:11:53,894
the donor could be
the killer?

00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:58,999
Sex is the foreplay.
Violence is the climax.

00:13:02,662 --> 00:13:05,465
Grissom...

00:13:05,532 --> 00:13:07,200
you take this one.

00:13:07,267 --> 00:13:08,535
( <i>muttering</i> )

00:13:10,404 --> 00:13:11,872
( <i>car horn blares</i> )

00:13:14,074 --> 00:13:16,176
Let's start with
the stomach contents.

00:13:16,243 --> 00:13:18,345
They're fascinating.

00:13:18,412 --> 00:13:19,613
It reminded me
of that scene in <i>Jaws</i>

00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,148
where Dreyfuss cuts open
the shark's belly

00:13:21,214 --> 00:13:22,783
and all kinds of weird
things come out.

00:13:22,849 --> 00:13:25,585
You find a license plate?

00:13:25,652 --> 00:13:27,387
Not quite.

00:13:27,454 --> 00:13:31,358
Highlights include Band-Aids,
wood chips, hair

00:13:31,425 --> 00:13:32,926
and half a snapshot.

00:13:32,993 --> 00:13:34,428
Pica?

00:13:34,494 --> 00:13:35,562
Boo?

00:13:37,931 --> 00:13:41,735
Pica is a compulsion
to eat non-nutritive food items.

00:13:41,802 --> 00:13:43,637
It's from the Latin word
for magpie,

00:13:43,704 --> 00:13:45,739
a bird with a large and
indiscriminate appetite.

00:13:45,806 --> 00:13:48,308
Trichotillomania would explain

00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:51,244
the pulling out
and eating of hair.

00:13:51,311 --> 00:13:53,213
Another OCD disorder.

00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,216
I sent hair and blood
samples to Tox.

00:13:56,283 --> 00:13:58,485
Stellate lacerations.

00:13:58,552 --> 00:14:00,287
Linear skull
fracture extending

00:14:00,354 --> 00:14:01,621
into the calvarium.

00:14:01,688 --> 00:14:03,490
And contre-coup contusions

00:14:03,557 --> 00:14:04,791
to the frontal
and temporal lobes.

00:14:04,858 --> 00:14:07,160
So C.O.D. was
blunt force trauma?

00:14:07,227 --> 00:14:08,929
No. Asphyxiation.

00:14:08,995 --> 00:14:10,130
During the struggle?

00:14:10,197 --> 00:14:11,765
No. Coagulation
of the blood

00:14:11,832 --> 00:14:15,135
tells me that the head trauma
was post-mortem,

00:14:15,202 --> 00:14:17,804
at least two hours
after he was suffocated.

00:14:17,871 --> 00:14:20,640
So evidently dead
wasn't dead enough.

00:14:20,707 --> 00:14:26,113
I also found ligature marks
on the wrists and ankles.

00:14:26,179 --> 00:14:29,449
They showed up
during the Y,
peri-mortem.

00:14:29,516 --> 00:14:32,819
So, what, tortured? Tied up?

00:14:32,886 --> 00:14:34,488
Restrained.

00:14:39,526 --> 00:14:41,995
Nobody mentioned restraints.

00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:47,120
HODGES:
Would you ever
bleach your hair?

00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:48,321
I wouldn't.

00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,089
It's so Greg Sanders.

00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:52,258
Most of the hair

00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:55,561
is the vic's, but I also found
that bleached sample as well.

00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:57,830
In my continuing quest
to further my standing,

00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,266
I took it upon myself to
get you the tox report.

00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:01,868
Thanks.
You're welcome.

00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:04,904
Blood came back with pretty
hefty levels of Olanzapine.

00:15:04,971 --> 00:15:06,639
That's a potent
anti-psychotic.

00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:07,740
Good for drooling.

00:15:07,807 --> 00:15:08,975
And also there's

00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:12,645
the, uh, not so potent
smattering of Ibuprofen.

00:15:12,712 --> 00:15:13,980
That's it?
That's it.

00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:15,715
If I were
institutionalized,

00:15:15,782 --> 00:15:17,650
I think I would hope

00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:19,185
for something better.

00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,487
Clonazepam, maybe.

00:15:21,554 --> 00:15:24,657
What, you, uh,
think I'm crazy?

00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:26,793
Crazy is as crazy does.

00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:28,294
His chart indicated

00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:30,296
at least four other
anti-psychotics.

00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:32,265
Why wasn't he getting
those meds?

00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:35,768
Do I look clairvoyant?

00:15:35,835 --> 00:15:37,603
BRASS:
<i>News flash from the loony bin.</i>

00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,173
Two reported deaths
in the last three years

00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:43,109
from "complications
due to restraint procedures."

00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:45,144
And how many have
gone unreported?

00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:47,113
The hospital
just got off probation.

00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,682
One more death by restraint
brings the Feds in.

00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:51,451
Good incentive
to keep it quiet.

00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:53,719
Or make it look like
someone else did it.

00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,122
Yeah. Somebody who's crazy.

00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:58,357
DUNBAR:
<i>We're legally required</i>
<i>to tape all our sessions.</i>

00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:01,594
This is Robbie
in the seclusion room

00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:03,329
the day he died.

00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:12,939
( <i>fast-forwarding tape</i> )

00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:14,440
As you can see,

00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:16,309
the on-call doctor
and Nurse Mckay

00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:17,743
checked in on him.

00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:22,315
Two hours later,

00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:24,851
he was escorted out,
so I resent the accusation.

00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:27,153
We've made a lot of changes.

00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:30,156
Policy, staff, surveillance
have all been overhauled.

00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:34,627
Look, Robbie left
the seclusion room alive.

00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:35,695
Okay, fine.

00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:37,330
Who administers
medication?

00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:38,965
Uh, the nurses, psych techs.

00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:40,299
Why is this important?

00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:42,101
Well, according
to his tox results,

00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:43,503
Robbie's system was short

00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:44,670
four anti-psychotics.

00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:46,172
Maybe he was cheeking them.

00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:57,450
Why would he do that?

00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:59,085
They think
they don't need 'em.

00:16:59,152 --> 00:17:00,887
They sell 'em, trade 'em or...

00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:02,655
store them up,
get high later.

00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:03,923
We're gonna need

00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,992
to talk to his pharmacist.

00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:08,060
Who's next?
Oh, come on, Earl.

00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:09,829
There you go.

00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:15,101
Hey, you know I'm gonna bust
your ass on the court, right?

00:17:15,168 --> 00:17:17,370
You better bring
your 'A' game next time.

00:17:17,437 --> 00:17:19,705
Come on, Chuck,
I got something for you.

00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:30,349
Love your hair, Leon.

00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:31,451
Thanks.

00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:33,386
What do you got here?

00:17:33,453 --> 00:17:35,721
Ibuprofen, laxative,

00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:37,056
aspirin.

00:17:37,123 --> 00:17:39,559
What are you treating exactly,
schizophrenia

00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,561
or constipation?

00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:43,029
Where are the real drugs, Leon?

00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:51,571
Man... Xanax, Lanzopine,

00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:55,308
Zoloft, Suprazadone,

00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:58,578
Clozapine, Loranzapan,
lithium, Valium,

00:17:58,644 --> 00:17:59,979
Wellbutrin, Haldol,

00:18:00,046 --> 00:18:01,581
Respiredone.

00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:04,484
You took everything
with street value.

00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,586
( <i>chuckles</i> ):
Look, dude...

00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:08,221
I get 22K a year.

00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:09,722
That's nothing.

00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:11,624
Diddly-squat.

00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:13,759
I should get hazard pay.

00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:15,128
These people, I get...

00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:17,563
I get spit on, puked on,
peed on, bitten.

00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:20,433
I get my hair yanked out,
I get my ass pinched,

00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,635
I get... I get
death threats.

00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:24,804
All for 22K.

00:18:24,871 --> 00:18:26,339
So I supplement
my income.

00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:28,775
It don't hurt nobody.

00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:30,276
Are you a doctor?

00:18:30,343 --> 00:18:34,413
Look, these places, they
overmedicate all the time.

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,182
It controls
the population.

00:18:36,249 --> 00:18:39,652
And I don't endanger
the patients, okay?

00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:41,654
I-I'm all about the patients.

00:18:41,721 --> 00:18:43,356
Maybe Robbie
caught you skimping

00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:45,224
on his meds, threatened
to blow the whistle.

00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,859
There goes that
supplemental income.

00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:51,097
I see what you're doing.

00:18:51,164 --> 00:18:54,434
I'm reporting you.
You're stealing.

00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,835
Robbie, hold on
a second, will you?

00:18:55,902 --> 00:18:59,305
( <i>screaming</i> )

00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:05,378
All right, here you go,
here you go, here you go.

00:19:05,445 --> 00:19:08,714
( <i>continues screaming</i> )

00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:15,688
No. All right, no way, man.

00:19:15,755 --> 00:19:17,056
That's a story.

00:19:17,123 --> 00:19:18,524
'Kay? That's not why

00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:19,559
he went to seclusion.

00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,294
Why did he go to seclusion?

00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,962
He freaked out in group.

00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:24,430
I wasn't even there.

00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:26,132
Ask somebody who was.

00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:29,902
Am I gonna lose my job?

00:19:29,969 --> 00:19:32,071
'Cause these people...

00:19:32,138 --> 00:19:34,240
need me.

00:19:34,307 --> 00:19:36,909
SIDLE:
According to the video logs,

00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:39,512
the victim was brought
into seclusion at 5:03 p.m.

00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:41,481
and taken out of the room
at 7:06 p.m.

00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:45,251
Nurse Mckay noted that
he was awake and in bed

00:19:45,318 --> 00:19:47,253
at the 9:30 p.m. bed-checks.

00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:51,290
Body was found at 12:10.

00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:54,527
So sometime between 9:30
and midnight, he was suffocated.

00:19:54,594 --> 00:19:56,362
Probably closer to 9:30.

00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:58,531
The blood would've needed time
to coagulate

00:19:58,598 --> 00:20:00,233
before his head was smashed in.

00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:03,436
And not necessarily
by the same person.

00:20:03,503 --> 00:20:05,004
Hey, how about
some pillow talk?

00:20:05,071 --> 00:20:07,006
Robbie's pillow
had saliva on it.

00:20:07,073 --> 00:20:09,208
Lots of it; all his.

00:20:09,275 --> 00:20:10,943
Could be from drooling.

00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:13,112
Or it could be from dying.

00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:17,283
Well, look at this--
I found slits at both ends.

00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,417
Left hand...

00:20:18,484 --> 00:20:20,686
and right hand.

00:20:23,122 --> 00:20:25,158
Looks like we have
a murder weapon.

00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:29,362
WOMAN ( <i>over P.A.</i> ):
All past-level-three patients,

00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:31,697
please return to your unit
for a head count.

00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:36,169
All past-level-three patients,
please return to your unit...

00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,271
Thanks, Officer.

00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:40,373
Nurse Mckay, hi.

00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,241
Dr. Dino said

00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:44,944
that you supervised
group therapy yesterday.

00:20:45,011 --> 00:20:46,579
Uh, yeah.
I heard there was

00:20:46,646 --> 00:20:49,382
an incident involving Robbie.

00:20:49,449 --> 00:20:51,417
He had a personal item.

00:20:51,484 --> 00:20:53,653
A personal item?

00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:57,490
You can't bring anything
in group except a beverage.

00:20:57,557 --> 00:20:59,292
It distracts the other patients.

00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:00,660
What did he bring?

00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:02,795
A photograph.

00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:04,630
Of what?

00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:07,100
A little boy.

00:21:08,568 --> 00:21:10,336
What did you do?

00:21:10,403 --> 00:21:13,106
I followed protocol.

00:21:13,172 --> 00:21:14,807
Anybody else have anything
they want to talk about?

00:21:14,874 --> 00:21:16,109
MAN:
I wanna know why everybody's

00:21:16,175 --> 00:21:17,610
always staring at me--
especially him.

00:21:17,677 --> 00:21:19,078
He's staring at me.

00:21:19,145 --> 00:21:21,581
I'm not staring at...
Hang on, hang on.

00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:22,615
Robbie?

00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:26,185
What have you got there?
Nothing.

00:21:26,252 --> 00:21:27,353
Fag candy.

00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,588
Well, what's the rule?

00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:30,256
There's no personal items...

00:21:30,323 --> 00:21:31,023
No!

Boom, boom and boom: medication,
seclusion, restraint.

00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:41,501
Tough love.
Call it what you want--

00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:43,035
these aren't my children.

00:21:43,102 --> 00:21:46,472
Why didn't you mention
this information last night?

00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:49,075
Because crap like that
happens every day here.

00:21:50,877 --> 00:21:53,312
I should get back
to the unit.
Sure.

Sidle.

00:21:58,117 --> 00:21:59,585
GRISSOM:
We got the DNA results back

00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:01,053
on the semen on Robbie's sheets.

00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,223
Patient Adam Trent--
the nail biter.

00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:05,725
Okay.

00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,802
This stuff is dark.

00:22:15,868 --> 00:22:17,537
Yeah.

00:22:17,603 --> 00:22:21,908
'Course, I wouldn't expect
Winnie the Pooh.

00:22:23,276 --> 00:22:25,511
Adam's subconscious
was working overtime.

SIDLE:
I bet you aced

00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:29,348
your Rorschachs.

00:22:29,415 --> 00:22:32,084
When I was
in fifth grade,

00:22:32,151 --> 00:22:34,320
I drew a picture
of a harpooned whale.

00:22:34,387 --> 00:22:36,222
Everyone thought I was gonzo'd.

00:22:36,289 --> 00:22:38,991
But I had just read
<i>Moby Dick.</i>

00:22:39,058 --> 00:22:43,296
Sometimes a dying whale
is just a dying whale.

00:23:23,202 --> 00:23:25,905
These are all postdated
over a year ago.

00:23:30,143 --> 00:23:31,611
It's not just his subconscious.

00:23:31,677 --> 00:23:33,546
This guy's got stuff
buried everywhere.

00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,166
DR. DINO:
"Dearest Angel,
I think of you wherever I go.

00:23:40,232 --> 00:23:42,001
"You are my prince.
I miss you.

00:23:42,068 --> 00:23:44,837
Write to me.
Your only love, Mother."

00:23:44,904 --> 00:23:46,439
Another one.

00:23:46,505 --> 00:23:48,407
Uh... "It rained today.

00:23:48,474 --> 00:23:50,409
"I thought of that time
when you and I got caught

00:23:50,476 --> 00:23:51,610
"in the storm at the lake.

00:23:51,677 --> 00:23:54,146
"The fire... I came home
and made your favorite dinner.

00:23:54,213 --> 00:23:55,514
I even set a
place for you..."

00:23:55,581 --> 00:23:57,149
So on and so forth.

00:23:57,216 --> 00:23:59,385
That does not sound
maternal to me.

00:23:59,452 --> 00:24:01,120
It's not.

00:24:01,187 --> 00:24:02,121
Incest?

00:24:02,188 --> 00:24:03,622
Fully consummated.

00:24:03,689 --> 00:24:07,193
Mother-son incest is rare
and deeply pathological.

00:24:07,259 --> 00:24:09,495
Oedipal complex taken too far?

00:24:09,562 --> 00:24:10,629
Oedipus...

00:24:10,696 --> 00:24:11,797
implies son to mother.

00:24:11,864 --> 00:24:14,200
In this case, the mother
was seeking the love

00:24:14,266 --> 00:24:15,835
and creating the codependence.

00:24:15,901 --> 00:24:17,536
We call this a Jocasta complex.

00:24:17,603 --> 00:24:19,271
Oedipus' mother.

00:24:19,338 --> 00:24:21,240
When Adam was nine

00:24:21,307 --> 00:24:22,274
his father died.

00:24:22,341 --> 00:24:24,977
His mother replaced her
dead husband with her son.

00:24:25,044 --> 00:24:26,779
That's got to mess you up.

00:24:26,846 --> 00:24:30,249
Yeah. Adam is schizo-affective,
suicidal,

00:24:30,316 --> 00:24:32,051
and a pathological narcissist.

00:24:32,118 --> 00:24:33,119
When he was a teenager

00:24:33,185 --> 00:24:34,787
he was unable to retaliate
against his mother

00:24:34,854 --> 00:24:38,657
and incapable
of actual intimacy,

00:24:38,724 --> 00:24:41,927
so... he started raping woman.

00:24:41,994 --> 00:24:43,329
GRISSOM:
Always women?

00:24:43,396 --> 00:24:46,165
Yes. Which is why I don't think
he killed Robbie.

00:24:46,232 --> 00:24:48,768
We found Adam's semen
in Robbie's bed.

00:24:48,834 --> 00:24:50,536
You see, that surprises me.

00:24:50,603 --> 00:24:54,640
Like any good psychopath, he
rarely veers from his pattern.

00:24:54,707 --> 00:24:56,575
Adam is
a single-celled organism

00:24:56,642 --> 00:24:58,677
who exists wholly for himself.

00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:02,515
He must've been getting
something tangible in return.

00:25:02,581 --> 00:25:03,516
What?

00:25:03,582 --> 00:25:06,018
Drugs? Cigarettes?

00:25:06,085 --> 00:25:07,820
Drugs aren't his issue.

00:25:07,887 --> 00:25:10,256
And as far as I know
he doesn't smoke. Um...

00:25:10,322 --> 00:25:12,925
So, uh, what can we
learn from his art work?

00:25:12,992 --> 00:25:16,462
Uh... He starts with

00:25:16,529 --> 00:25:19,165
an innocuous object;
a tree, a cat, an oboe--

00:25:19,231 --> 00:25:20,533
all of which he morphs

00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:22,968
into something deadly.
You can see...

00:25:23,035 --> 00:25:25,171
all of them.

00:25:25,237 --> 00:25:26,338
So what should

00:25:26,405 --> 00:25:29,809
be safe turns
into something unsafe.

00:25:29,875 --> 00:25:31,177
Mother becomes lover.

00:25:31,243 --> 00:25:32,611
What about the mother?

00:25:32,678 --> 00:25:34,146
Do you have any idea
where she is?

00:25:34,213 --> 00:25:36,515
She lives near Reno.

00:25:36,582 --> 00:25:39,985
Based on the postmarks, it seems
like she stopped writing him.

00:25:40,052 --> 00:25:43,155
Every time a letter came
a manic episode followed,

00:25:43,222 --> 00:25:45,825
then a severe depression,
including one suicide attempt.

00:25:45,891 --> 00:25:51,697
So I started sending
the letters back.

00:25:51,764 --> 00:25:53,766
Eventually, she stopped writing.

00:25:55,935 --> 00:25:58,337
( <i>thunder softly rumbles</i> )

00:26:00,406 --> 00:26:03,409
Did I kill him?

00:26:03,476 --> 00:26:06,145
Yes.

00:26:06,212 --> 00:26:07,813
Why?

00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,349
He was queer.

00:26:10,416 --> 00:26:12,685
But you had sex
with him.

00:26:15,554 --> 00:26:17,256
No.

00:26:17,323 --> 00:26:19,759
He had sex with me.

00:26:19,825 --> 00:26:21,660
He was the punk.

00:26:21,727 --> 00:26:24,363
Was it consensual?

00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:26,432
I don't know.

00:26:26,499 --> 00:26:28,501
So why did you do it?

00:26:28,567 --> 00:26:31,570
I don't know.

00:26:31,637 --> 00:26:33,939
SIDLE:
Okay.

00:26:34,006 --> 00:26:36,008
So then what happened?

00:26:36,075 --> 00:26:38,978
I took his head
and I smashed it into the floor.

00:26:41,981 --> 00:26:44,150
And that's how you killed him?

00:26:48,454 --> 00:26:50,456
What? You don't believe me?

00:26:50,523 --> 00:26:52,625
I'm just wondering if
that's how you killed him.

00:26:52,691 --> 00:26:54,627
Yes. I'm saying this
and this is true.

00:26:54,693 --> 00:26:55,961
And if you don't believe me,

00:26:56,028 --> 00:26:59,398
just look in the bucket
in the latrine.

00:26:59,465 --> 00:27:00,332
Okay...

00:27:01,934 --> 00:27:05,304
Do you really want to know
why I killed him?

00:27:05,371 --> 00:27:06,939
Yes.

00:27:13,212 --> 00:27:16,615
It's because I'm crazy.

00:27:22,655 --> 00:27:25,291
Not a word about suffocation.

00:27:25,357 --> 00:27:26,826
Well, his nails
weren't long enough

00:27:26,892 --> 00:27:28,394
to leave those tears
in the pillow.

00:27:28,461 --> 00:27:30,696
And there would have
been traces of blood
from his cuticles.

00:27:30,763 --> 00:27:32,665
Something is off.

00:27:53,853 --> 00:27:56,455

we've been looking for.

either take this
and the underwear

back to the lab
and confirm the match,

our presence here.

happens for a reason?

That bad things are
there to teach us

in to a higher frequency.

You seem to take your
job rather personally.

00:32:19,122 --> 00:32:20,523
What are you suggesting?

00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:23,226
That you had an intimate
relationship with Adam Trent.

00:32:23,292 --> 00:32:25,428
That's ridiculous.

00:32:25,495 --> 00:32:26,996
Your lipstick
is on his underwear.

00:32:27,063 --> 00:32:28,498
I gave Robbie my lipstick
sometimes.

00:32:28,564 --> 00:32:29,832
Maybe he was
wearing it when...

00:32:29,899 --> 00:32:31,868
We didn't find any on his lips.

00:32:31,934 --> 00:32:36,072
Well, that's your problem.

00:32:36,139 --> 00:32:37,907
What are you waiting for?

00:32:37,974 --> 00:32:40,143
Get him to
the medical unit, stat.

00:33:10,907 --> 00:33:13,276
Excuse me.

00:33:14,911 --> 00:33:16,979
Adam Trent was working on
this piece?

00:33:17,046 --> 00:33:18,114
Yes.

00:33:18,181 --> 00:33:20,383
He made it on Monday.

00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:23,219
But he never got a chance
to fire it.

00:33:23,286 --> 00:33:24,987
Nurse Mckay came in,

00:33:25,054 --> 00:33:27,757
they had a
conversation.

00:33:27,824 --> 00:33:30,226
Actually, it was
more of an argument,

00:33:30,293 --> 00:33:31,794
very heated, very loud.

00:33:38,868 --> 00:33:41,337
And then she yanked
him out of class.

00:33:41,404 --> 00:33:43,806
Was this on the wheel
while they were arguing?

00:33:43,873 --> 00:33:45,208
Yeah.

00:33:48,511 --> 00:33:50,780
Adam's work is
very provocative.

00:33:50,847 --> 00:33:52,849
Yeah.

00:33:52,915 --> 00:33:55,785
It speaks to me.

00:33:55,852 --> 00:33:57,420
SIDLE:
Acoustic Archeology?

00:33:57,487 --> 00:33:59,255
In the '60s,
experiments were done

00:33:59,322 --> 00:34:01,791
on clay pots
and painted canvas.

00:34:01,858 --> 00:34:03,526
Scientists were able
to ferret out

00:34:03,593 --> 00:34:06,129
sounds that were captured
during the creative process

00:34:06,195 --> 00:34:07,363
in the clay and the paint.

00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:08,731
Trippy.

00:34:08,798 --> 00:34:11,200
It's actually
not that out there.

00:34:11,267 --> 00:34:13,569
In the old days, the first
gramophone recordings

00:34:13,636 --> 00:34:16,472
were made by taking
the vibrations of sound

00:34:16,539 --> 00:34:18,541
and cutting them
into wax cylinders

00:34:18,608 --> 00:34:19,709
while they were turning.

00:34:22,445 --> 00:34:24,914
<i>Based on the frequency</i>
<i>and intensity of the sound,</i>

00:34:24,981 --> 00:34:27,183
<i>the stylus cut into the wax,</i>

00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:29,752
<i>creating distinct variances</i>
<i>of depth and width.</i>

00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:34,424
For playback,

00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:37,693
a mechanical transducer
vibrated along a groove,

00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,263
generating a current
which, when amplified,

00:34:40,329 --> 00:34:41,364
turned into sound.

00:34:41,431 --> 00:34:43,099
When the art therapist
told me

00:34:43,166 --> 00:34:45,601
that there'd been an argument
while Adam was on the wheel,

00:34:45,668 --> 00:34:47,837
I thought well, maybe we can

00:34:47,904 --> 00:34:48,871
pull some sound
off his pot.

00:34:48,938 --> 00:34:50,039
SIDLE:
Doppler laser.

00:34:50,106 --> 00:34:51,707
Optical transducer.

00:34:51,774 --> 00:34:53,443
We've come a long way.

00:34:53,509 --> 00:34:54,644
Baby.

00:34:57,914 --> 00:34:58,915
( <i>beeps</i> )

00:34:58,981 --> 00:35:01,884
Well, there's something there.

00:35:03,686 --> 00:35:05,121
And it sounds like...

00:35:05,188 --> 00:35:06,556
( <i>beeps</i> )

00:35:06,622 --> 00:35:08,057
this.

00:35:08,124 --> 00:35:10,093
( <i>static</i> )

00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:11,294
It's lousy signal-to-noise.

00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,528
It's going to need a lot

00:35:12,595 --> 00:35:14,163
of processing.

00:35:19,001 --> 00:35:20,303
( <i>warbling</i> )

00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:26,142
( <i>warbling</i> )

00:35:26,209 --> 00:35:27,944
Speech elements skew
to consonants.

00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:30,713
I'll try and dig them out.

00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,482
( <i>computer beeps</i> )

00:35:34,217 --> 00:35:36,085
( <i>warbling</i> )

00:35:38,554 --> 00:35:42,458
Rrr-bee... Rrr-bee...

00:35:42,525 --> 00:35:43,993
Robbie?

00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,561
Maybe.

00:35:45,628 --> 00:35:48,064
Could you run that
back a little bit?

00:35:48,131 --> 00:35:49,165
Sure.

00:35:49,232 --> 00:35:51,000
( <i>warbles</i> )

00:35:51,067 --> 00:35:52,635
What is that?

00:35:52,702 --> 00:35:55,138
( <i>warble repeats</i> )

00:35:55,204 --> 00:35:56,506
Right there.

00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,743
Nnn-gl. Nnn-gl...

00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:02,412
Angle?

00:36:02,478 --> 00:36:03,646
Angel.

00:36:03,713 --> 00:36:05,648
...my angel.

00:36:05,715 --> 00:36:07,483
My angel. My angel.

00:36:09,585 --> 00:36:13,489
In her letters, Adam's mother
called him "angel."

00:36:18,194 --> 00:36:19,896
The hair from the brush
in Adam's room

00:36:19,962 --> 00:36:22,365
was fresh enough
to get a DNA profile.

00:36:22,432 --> 00:36:23,966
It came back female.

00:36:24,033 --> 00:36:26,836
We tested it against
your cigarette butt.

00:36:26,903 --> 00:36:28,271
It matched.

00:36:28,337 --> 00:36:30,706
Adam liked it when
I brushed his hair.

00:36:30,773 --> 00:36:32,508
I bet he did.

00:36:32,575 --> 00:36:36,913
You were lying about
giving Robbie lipstick.

00:36:36,979 --> 00:36:41,451
You have seven out of 13
alleles in common

00:36:41,517 --> 00:36:44,687
with your patient,
Adam Trent.

00:36:44,754 --> 00:36:47,457
Your dearest angel.

00:36:47,523 --> 00:36:49,525
Okay.

00:36:49,592 --> 00:36:51,194
Joanne Mckay,
registered nurse,

00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:53,496
licensed by the Nevada
Board of Nursing 1978.

00:36:53,563 --> 00:36:56,866
Married Howard Trent 1980.

00:36:56,933 --> 00:36:59,102
The board requires you
to get a new certificate

00:36:59,168 --> 00:37:00,136
when you get married.

00:37:00,203 --> 00:37:01,471
I guess you never complied.

00:37:01,537 --> 00:37:03,573
I've always gone by
my maiden name.

00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:05,308
I guess that makes it
less embarrassing

00:37:05,374 --> 00:37:07,043
to check into the motel
with your son.

00:37:09,812 --> 00:37:10,813
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,482
You checked into
a psycho ward instead.

00:37:12,548 --> 00:37:13,983
My son needed me.

00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:15,918
SIDLE:
For what?

00:37:15,985 --> 00:37:17,754
To destroy his ego?

00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,489
To fill him with guilt?

00:37:19,555 --> 00:37:22,091
To make him hate himself so much
he would take his own life

00:37:22,158 --> 00:37:24,560
just to be free of you?

00:37:24,627 --> 00:37:28,231
You have no idea
what goes on between us.

00:37:28,297 --> 00:37:30,166
Let's cut the umbilical cord,
okay?

00:37:30,233 --> 00:37:33,169
Six months ago your
letters started
to come back.

00:37:33,236 --> 00:37:36,205
No more communication with
little Lord Fauntleroy.

00:37:36,272 --> 00:37:38,174
So you apply to Desert State.

00:37:38,241 --> 00:37:40,143
They were desperate
for nursing staff,

00:37:40,209 --> 00:37:41,210
so you got a job.

00:37:41,277 --> 00:37:44,914
Gentlemen, this is our
new nurse, Nurse Mckay.

00:37:44,981 --> 00:37:49,185
Hello.

00:37:49,252 --> 00:37:51,721
Bet it's tough to turn
a folie á deux

00:37:51,788 --> 00:37:53,222
into a menage á trois.

00:37:53,289 --> 00:37:55,725
<i>N'est-ce pas?</i>

00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:04,400
Even tougher that your son
was cheating on you...

00:38:04,467 --> 00:38:07,103
with a man no less.

00:38:12,341 --> 00:38:14,744
You need to stop this.

00:38:14,811 --> 00:38:16,112
Stop what?

00:38:16,179 --> 00:38:18,347
End it with Robbie.

00:38:18,414 --> 00:38:20,083
Don't tell me
what to do.

00:38:20,149 --> 00:38:22,218
End it or I will.

00:38:23,386 --> 00:38:25,388
But he didn't end it, did he?

00:38:25,455 --> 00:38:28,291
Robbie was lover's leverage.

00:38:28,357 --> 00:38:30,927
He was that thing that Adam
kept in his back pocket

00:38:30,993 --> 00:38:32,428
and pull out
whenever he needed

00:38:32,495 --> 00:38:34,797
to distance himself from you.

00:38:34,864 --> 00:38:37,600
So you had no choice
but to get rid of Robbie.

00:38:37,667 --> 00:38:40,436
And being a good nurse,
you knew his trigger.

00:38:43,539 --> 00:38:44,540
I want you

00:38:44,607 --> 00:38:46,075
to talk about this
in group today.

00:38:46,142 --> 00:38:47,243
B-But I thought that we...

00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:48,811
It's okay.
You can bring it.

00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,615
Hey! Robbie.

00:38:53,783 --> 00:38:54,984
What do you got there?

00:38:55,051 --> 00:38:57,086
There's no personal items
in group.

00:38:57,153 --> 00:38:58,287
B-But y-you...
you told me...

00:38:58,354 --> 00:38:59,922
that I could bring this.

00:38:59,989 --> 00:39:01,324
I didn't say anything.
Give me that.

00:39:01,391 --> 00:39:02,458
What is that,
a picture?

00:39:02,525 --> 00:39:04,026
You remember?
Give me the picture.

00:39:04,093 --> 00:39:05,128
No, do you remember?

00:39:05,194 --> 00:39:06,929
You remember? No!
Give me the picture.

00:39:06,996 --> 00:39:07,897
No, you don't tell me!

00:39:07,964 --> 00:39:08,831
You told me...!

00:39:08,898 --> 00:39:10,333
( <i>yelling</i> )
Hang on!

00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,668
( <i>screaming</i> )

00:39:19,709 --> 00:39:23,513
( <i>muffled screams</i> )

00:39:23,579 --> 00:39:26,416
You manipulated the situation

00:39:26,482 --> 00:39:28,251
and took advantage
of his weakness.

00:39:28,317 --> 00:39:30,319
SIDLE:
Exactly what you have
been doing to Adam

00:39:30,386 --> 00:39:32,622
for the past 20 years.

00:39:32,688 --> 00:39:37,560
And being such a good mother,
you made him cover it up.

00:39:37,627 --> 00:39:39,062
Again.

00:39:58,581 --> 00:40:01,617
Why would my son do that?

00:40:01,684 --> 00:40:04,220
Because he loves you
as much as he hates you.

00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:09,025
You can't prove any of this.

00:40:09,092 --> 00:40:11,094
Just the incest,

00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,528
which is a Class B felony.

00:40:12,595 --> 00:40:14,297
It carries a penalty
of up to ten years.

00:40:14,363 --> 00:40:16,132
That's ten years

00:40:16,199 --> 00:40:17,500
away from Adam.

00:40:17,567 --> 00:40:21,604
Good luck getting him
to testify.

00:40:25,942 --> 00:40:27,677
Okay.

00:40:37,587 --> 00:40:39,222
Well, jail or no jail,

00:40:39,288 --> 00:40:41,657
I don't think she'll
last six months.

00:40:41,724 --> 00:40:45,695
She'll die
without her son.

00:40:45,762 --> 00:40:49,132
That would be better
for both of them.
