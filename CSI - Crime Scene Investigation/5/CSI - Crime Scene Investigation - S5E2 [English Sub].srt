00:00:02,709 --> 00:00:04,711
( <i>thunder rumbling</i> )

00:00:29,836 --> 00:00:31,838
( <i>footsteps splashing</i> )

00:01:07,407 --> 00:01:09,209
( <i>shutter clicking</i> )

00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:11,644
Who found him?

00:01:11,711 --> 00:01:12,679
The police

00:01:12,745 --> 00:01:15,014
were sweeping the area
looking for vagrants,

00:01:15,081 --> 00:01:17,217
trying to keep 'em
above water.

00:01:17,283 --> 00:01:18,518
Take a look at his nose.

00:01:21,754 --> 00:01:22,855
Same thing with his chin...

00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,025
His elbows...

00:01:26,092 --> 00:01:27,794
And his knees.

00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,963
He lost all his points.

00:01:30,029 --> 00:01:31,864
Like a rock in a tumbler.

00:01:31,931 --> 00:01:33,266
I'm sorry I'm late.

00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:35,001
Stopped to get
my waders.

00:01:38,771 --> 00:01:40,807
No wallet.

00:01:41,841 --> 00:01:44,777
Hold on.

00:01:44,844 --> 00:01:46,679
What do you think?

00:01:46,746 --> 00:01:49,616
I'll get it to Narco.

00:01:49,682 --> 00:01:51,284
Take a look.

00:01:52,752 --> 00:01:54,153
Cause of death?

00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,356
Water pressure
could have done it.

00:01:56,422 --> 00:01:57,624
Or a person.

00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:58,725
( <i>shutter clicks</i> )

00:02:00,226 --> 00:02:01,294
Hey.

00:02:01,361 --> 00:02:02,762
Whoo!

00:02:02,829 --> 00:02:03,796
It's a mess.

00:02:03,863 --> 00:02:05,064
I've talked
to every

00:02:05,131 --> 00:02:06,466
resident in the area.

00:02:06,532 --> 00:02:07,967
No one knows this guy.

00:02:08,034 --> 00:02:09,702
No unaccounted‐for vehicles.

00:02:09,769 --> 00:02:11,304
I don't know
what to tell you.

00:02:11,371 --> 00:02:14,974
Well, at least we know
where he came from.

00:02:18,478 --> 00:02:20,747
Aren't we at least
gonna draw straws?

00:02:20,813 --> 00:02:21,981
No.

00:02:46,773 --> 00:02:49,275
BROWN:
We must be under
the freeway by now.

00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,145
Hey.

00:02:52,212 --> 00:02:54,180
Did I ever tell you
that the city paid me

00:02:54,247 --> 00:02:56,349
a dollar a square foot
to rip out my lawn

00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:58,785
and replace it with rocks
because we're in a drought?

00:02:58,851 --> 00:02:59,786
Are you
kidding me?

00:02:59,852 --> 00:03:00,787
No.

00:03:00,853 --> 00:03:02,956
This city was not made for rain.

00:03:37,056 --> 00:03:38,258
Catherine.

00:03:46,733 --> 00:03:48,001
Grissom.

00:03:48,067 --> 00:03:49,235
We got another body.

00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:51,004
( <i>gasping</i> )

00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:54,874

00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,916
Listen, I need
to ask you a question.

00:04:36,982 --> 00:04:38,450
Have you ever seen
this guy right here?

00:04:38,517 --> 00:04:40,786
No.

00:04:40,853 --> 00:04:42,488
You don't know him?

00:04:42,555 --> 00:04:44,723
No, someone comes down here
that don't belong,

00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:48,394
I mean, bad stuff
can happen, okay?

00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,596
I‐I‐I just want
to go home, okay?

00:04:50,663 --> 00:04:53,465
A‐a‐and you can't make me

00:04:53,532 --> 00:04:54,667
leave my house.

00:04:54,733 --> 00:04:56,735
Nobody's making you
do anything, okay?

00:04:56,802 --> 00:04:57,937
Now, you like coffee?

00:04:58,003 --> 00:04:58,971
Well, yeah,

00:04:59,038 --> 00:05:00,473
as long as it's a decaf,

00:05:00,539 --> 00:05:02,408
one sugar, two cream, no skim,

00:05:02,475 --> 00:05:04,810
and hot‐‐ your lawsuit hot.

00:05:04,877 --> 00:05:06,412
Okay, you go
with that officer over there.

00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,280
He'll get you a nice cup
of coffee, all right?

00:05:14,954 --> 00:05:16,956
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:05:24,096 --> 00:05:26,098
( <i>rustling</i> )

00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,168
Is that you, Warrick?

00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:32,538
There you are.

00:05:32,605 --> 00:05:33,973
Phew.

00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,579
Is that a sneaker?

00:05:40,646 --> 00:05:42,148
Looks like an Aquasock.

00:05:42,214 --> 00:05:44,383
Yeah.

00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:45,618
Here's its mate.

00:05:48,387 --> 00:05:50,289
Kind of upscale
for a tunnel rat.

00:05:50,356 --> 00:05:52,925
So the vic
was barefoot.

00:05:52,992 --> 00:05:54,026
The tunnel's

00:05:54,093 --> 00:05:56,328
full of murder weapons.

00:05:56,395 --> 00:06:00,866
Bum kills him, or finds
the body and takes the socks?

00:06:00,933 --> 00:06:03,202
What was the guy doing here
in the first place?

00:06:03,269 --> 00:06:07,206
Well, maybe the vic was some
punk, uh... with an attitude.

00:06:07,273 --> 00:06:08,707
Decided to take it out
on some homeless guy.

00:06:08,774 --> 00:06:09,875
You never know.
It happens.

00:06:09,942 --> 00:06:11,443
The way the body
was ground down

00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:14,146
means that the water took him
for a pretty long ride.

00:06:14,213 --> 00:06:16,816
Well, we're already wet, so...

00:06:16,882 --> 00:06:19,218
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:06:24,056 --> 00:06:25,558
Yeah. Yeah.

00:06:25,624 --> 00:06:27,092
Yeah.

00:06:27,159 --> 00:06:29,895
WILLOWS:
Excuse me!

00:06:29,962 --> 00:06:31,630
Down here!

00:06:32,631 --> 00:06:33,766
Oh.

00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:35,401
What's your problem, sweetie?

00:06:35,467 --> 00:06:36,769
Uh, no problem, sir.

00:06:36,836 --> 00:06:40,239
I'm just wanting to know
what street I'm on. Under.

00:06:40,306 --> 00:06:43,108
Oh, it's, uh, Industrial.

00:06:43,175 --> 00:06:45,010
You're just south of Tropicana.

00:06:45,077 --> 00:06:46,111
Thank you.

00:06:46,178 --> 00:06:48,481
And I'm not holding the bus.

00:06:49,982 --> 00:06:51,250
Don't bother.

00:06:51,317 --> 00:06:53,786
All right, so we're
about a mile south

00:06:53,853 --> 00:06:55,254
of where we started.

00:06:55,321 --> 00:06:58,123
Well, there's 300
miles of storm drains

00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:01,193
in Clark County, so we
only have 299 to go.

00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,195
What, do we, uh,
eenie‐meenie‐minie‐mo it?

00:07:03,262 --> 00:07:05,197
Split up? What do we do?

00:07:05,264 --> 00:07:07,867
No, that's
a dead end.

00:07:11,937 --> 00:07:13,873
Sunscreen on a lanyard.

00:07:13,939 --> 00:07:17,209
Fits with the Aquasocks.

00:07:17,276 --> 00:07:20,546
I say we keep
going upstream.

00:07:20,613 --> 00:07:22,281
I knew you were
gonna say that.

00:07:23,282 --> 00:07:24,950
Don't hit your head.

00:07:47,206 --> 00:07:49,742
I'm gonna need the drain pan.

00:08:03,923 --> 00:08:06,592
This town isn't
built for rain, hmm?

00:08:09,495 --> 00:08:11,197
( <i>buzzing</i> )

00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:15,167

00:08:22,775 --> 00:08:24,109

( <i>grunts</i> )

00:08:27,546 --> 00:08:29,448
Come on, don't be shy.

00:08:29,515 --> 00:08:31,250
Take a good look.

00:08:37,723 --> 00:08:39,892
In the end...

00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:41,260
it's all we really are.

00:08:51,871 --> 00:08:54,206
If you're gonna be sick,
Greg, do it in the sink.

00:08:54,273 --> 00:08:56,008
Not in the drain pan.

00:08:56,075 --> 00:08:58,444
I don't feel sick.

00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:05,584
Take a look at the trachea.

00:09:05,651 --> 00:09:07,219
What do you see?

00:09:09,255 --> 00:09:10,523
Foam.

00:09:10,589 --> 00:09:12,424
Like the head of a beer.

00:09:13,726 --> 00:09:14,994
Sorry.

00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,196
No. It's a good analogy.

00:09:17,263 --> 00:09:19,165
Pulmonary edema, fluids

00:09:19,231 --> 00:09:20,799
in the air passages.

00:09:20,866 --> 00:09:22,067
So he drowned?

00:09:22,134 --> 00:09:24,403
Well, doesn't prove it.

00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:27,573
Same thing happens with, uh,
heart failure or drug overdose.

00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,676
But the fact that
the heart of the victim

00:09:30,743 --> 00:09:31,677
was a normal size,

00:09:31,744 --> 00:09:34,513
and assuming tox doesn't
show drug overdose,

00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,415
C.O.D. is most likely drowning,

00:09:36,482 --> 00:09:38,884
but I'm not gonna rule out
blunt‐force trauma.

00:09:38,951 --> 00:09:40,119
( <i>buzzing</i> )

00:09:43,622 --> 00:09:45,558
Daylight. Finally.

00:09:45,624 --> 00:09:47,893
We gotta be into some
golden time by now, right?

00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,228
Oh, yeah. For real.

00:09:49,295 --> 00:09:50,896
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:09:50,963 --> 00:09:53,165
Ka‐ching, Ka‐ching.

00:09:53,232 --> 00:09:55,434
What do we have here?

00:09:56,969 --> 00:09:58,771
Brain bucket.

00:10:03,275 --> 00:10:05,110
Hang on to that.

00:10:05,177 --> 00:10:06,846
Hey, it's our dead guy.

00:10:06,912 --> 00:10:07,947
No way.

00:10:08,013 --> 00:10:10,282
Calvin Berkowitz.

00:10:10,349 --> 00:10:11,584
Worked at the Tangiers.

00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:12,785
Lifeguard.

00:10:13,986 --> 00:10:16,255
So what's Calvin
doing down here?

00:10:24,196 --> 00:10:25,364
It's an inner tube.

00:10:25,431 --> 00:10:26,599
Yeah?

00:10:26,665 --> 00:10:29,168
Guy gets the day off
and decides to go surfing...

00:10:29,235 --> 00:10:31,303
<i>Vegas style.</i>

00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:34,140
Oh, I heard about that.

00:10:34,206 --> 00:10:35,975
He grabs an inner tube, a
helmet, jumps into the channel.

00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:38,210
Hits his head
on something, drowns.

00:10:38,277 --> 00:10:39,812
So it takes him down.

00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:41,981
That would account
for all that body trauma.

00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:45,618
This isn't about drugs
or beating up homeless dudes.

00:10:45,684 --> 00:10:48,220
It's just plain stupidity.

00:10:48,287 --> 00:10:49,722
( <i>snorts</i> )

00:10:49,788 --> 00:10:50,756
Well, that's
what happens

00:10:50,823 --> 00:10:52,691
when you don't have
a decent beach in Vegas.

00:10:54,226 --> 00:10:55,327
Hey, you know something?

00:10:55,394 --> 00:10:57,630
This is, uh, right around
where I found Lindsay.

00:10:57,696 --> 00:10:58,631
Really?

00:10:58,697 --> 00:11:02,234
Yeah, when Eddie's car
went off the road.

00:11:02,301 --> 00:11:03,903
Ugh... Let's just
get out of here.

00:11:03,969 --> 00:11:05,104
Can you take that?

00:11:05,171 --> 00:11:06,906
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:11:06,972 --> 00:11:08,240
Watch your step.

00:11:08,307 --> 00:11:09,508
Hey.

00:11:09,575 --> 00:11:10,509
Oh.

00:11:10,576 --> 00:11:11,510
( <i>laughing</i> )

00:11:11,577 --> 00:11:12,511
You all right?

00:11:12,578 --> 00:11:13,512
Yeah, I think.

00:11:13,579 --> 00:11:14,580
Whoa.

00:11:16,849 --> 00:11:19,418
MAN:
Hey!

00:11:19,485 --> 00:11:20,753
You guys CSI?

00:11:22,321 --> 00:11:23,656
Yeah.

00:11:24,657 --> 00:11:27,092
Well, the city's been
rehabbing manholes

00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:28,594
with fiberglass liners.

00:11:28,661 --> 00:11:30,262
All the hydrogen
sulfide down there

00:11:30,329 --> 00:11:32,932
really eats up
the concrete.

00:11:32,998 --> 00:11:37,102
Anyways, we, uh, pulled
these out of the main.

00:11:37,169 --> 00:11:39,638
We find a lot of small
animal bones down there,

00:11:39,705 --> 00:11:41,740
squirrels, cats,
rats, you know.

00:11:41,807 --> 00:11:43,642
but that's really
tiny stuff.

00:11:43,709 --> 00:11:44,944
This looks more like people.

00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:48,380
Fingers or toes,
or fingers <i>and</i> toes.

00:11:48,447 --> 00:11:50,483
Well, animal bones <i>can</i> fool you.

00:11:50,549 --> 00:11:53,052
Pig's feet or sheep ribs
are not much different

00:11:53,118 --> 00:11:54,119
from yours or mine.

00:11:54,186 --> 00:11:56,288
Flaky texture.

00:11:56,355 --> 00:11:58,591
Probably a couple years old.

00:12:00,459 --> 00:12:03,195
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:12:03,262 --> 00:12:06,799
Yep. We're gonna have
to flush the line.

00:12:09,735 --> 00:12:12,805
You guys get a lot of jokes
about this thing?

00:12:12,872 --> 00:12:15,007
What do you think?

00:12:29,088 --> 00:12:31,724
( <i>beeping</i> )

00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,559
Vactor's in place.

00:12:33,626 --> 00:12:36,695
Ready when you are.

00:12:36,762 --> 00:12:38,164
Rip it.

00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:40,199
Let's go.

00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:57,983
Warrick.

00:12:58,050 --> 00:12:59,084
Yo.

00:12:59,151 --> 00:13:01,720
I got some bones here.

00:13:01,787 --> 00:13:05,024
Anything distinctive?

00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:07,193
Yeah. I got part of a rib.

00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:10,095
Uh‐huh. I can see
the costal groove.

00:13:10,162 --> 00:13:13,365
And it's too deep
to be an animal's.

00:13:13,432 --> 00:13:14,500
These bones are human.

00:13:18,504 --> 00:13:20,739
This is the sewage vault
where they found the bones.

00:13:20,806 --> 00:13:23,375
How do we know the bones just
didn't wash off the street?

00:13:23,442 --> 00:13:26,412
Well, wastewater sewage
is a closed system.

00:13:26,479 --> 00:13:29,114
It's completely separate
from the storm drains.

00:13:29,181 --> 00:13:31,350
Someone must have flushed it
down a toilet, a sink, a tub,

00:13:31,417 --> 00:13:33,552
or tossed them directly
into a manhole.

00:13:33,619 --> 00:13:35,421
And the bones look pretty old,

00:13:35,488 --> 00:13:37,790
so it could just be
from a grave robber

00:13:37,857 --> 00:13:39,124
getting rid of his leftovers.

00:13:39,191 --> 00:13:41,961
Or a serial killer
with a lot of patience.

00:13:42,027 --> 00:13:44,396
200,000 service connections,

00:13:44,463 --> 00:13:46,799
serving half a million
residences.

00:13:46,866 --> 00:13:48,667
1,600 miles of pipe,

00:13:48,734 --> 00:13:51,103
gravity fed.

00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:53,172
If we're gonna find
where the bones came from,

00:13:53,239 --> 00:13:54,440
we gotta work our way up.

00:14:28,908 --> 00:14:30,109
Catherine.

00:14:30,176 --> 00:14:31,944
Recovered more bones.

00:14:32,011 --> 00:14:33,012
Oh.

00:14:33,078 --> 00:14:35,714
Pelvis fragment
and two humerus.

00:14:35,781 --> 00:14:37,783
Well, large bones wouldn't
travel down the line

00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:38,951
as far as the small ones,

00:14:39,018 --> 00:14:40,286
so at least we're getting closer
to the source.

00:14:40,352 --> 00:14:42,488
WARRICK:
These plumbers must be working
overtime.

00:14:42,555 --> 00:14:44,657
Lots of backed up toilets.

00:14:44,723 --> 00:14:45,658
I don't think the bones

00:14:45,724 --> 00:14:47,026
could have come
from any one of these houses.

00:14:47,092 --> 00:14:49,929
Residential sewer lines
are only four‐inch pipes.

00:14:49,995 --> 00:14:50,930
Okay.

00:14:50,996 --> 00:14:52,064
And they make
a 90‐degree turn

00:14:52,131 --> 00:14:53,299
before they connect
to the main.

00:14:53,365 --> 00:14:54,567
Look at the size
of these bones.

00:14:54,633 --> 00:14:55,634
Yeah.

00:14:55,701 --> 00:14:57,203
They're too big
to make a turn like that.

00:14:57,269 --> 00:15:00,940
Right. So the blockage has gotta
be from the main line.

00:15:01,006 --> 00:15:03,309
One more vault down the street.

00:15:04,844 --> 00:15:06,145
( <i>groans</i> )

00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:13,085
Jackpot.

00:15:13,152 --> 00:15:15,087
( <i>coughs</i> )

00:15:15,154 --> 00:15:16,856
Oh, man.

00:15:19,425 --> 00:15:20,559
I'll go check it out.

00:15:20,626 --> 00:15:22,228
( <i>gasps</i> )

00:15:32,505 --> 00:15:34,707
It's like
a waterline stain.

00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:41,514
Hand me my florazene
and my glasses, please.

00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,681
Uh.

00:15:44,316 --> 00:15:45,618
Florazene

00:15:45,684 --> 00:15:49,922
reacts to feces
as well as blood,

00:15:49,989 --> 00:15:52,892
so I know that you're not
looking for blood.

00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:55,961
No. These vaults
are built big
for access.

00:15:56,028 --> 00:15:58,397
They're not reservoirs.

00:15:58,464 --> 00:16:01,133
Water's supposed to stay down
in the pipes.

00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,501
And the only way the water
would rise

00:16:02,568 --> 00:16:04,069
is if there's something
blocking the pipe.

00:16:04,136 --> 00:16:05,070
Mm‐hmm.

00:16:05,137 --> 00:16:06,205
And loose bones

00:16:06,272 --> 00:16:08,207
wouldn't do that.

00:16:08,274 --> 00:16:10,109
But a whole body would.

00:16:12,978 --> 00:16:15,414
Water rises, submerges the body.

00:16:15,481 --> 00:16:17,349
WILLOWS:
Tissue decomposes

00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:22,154
until there's not enough body
left to withstand the pressure.

00:16:25,591 --> 00:16:27,293
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:16:28,494 --> 00:16:32,398
I don't think we're looking
for a grave robber.

00:16:32,464 --> 00:16:35,301
We're looking for a murderer.

00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:44,363
ROBBINS:
Femur measurements make your
victim around five foot six.

00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:46,932
Pubic arch, mm,
sharply angled,

00:16:46,999 --> 00:16:50,136
less than 90‐degrees,
indicates male.

00:16:50,202 --> 00:16:51,337
I'll send it to Greg.

00:16:51,404 --> 00:16:53,072
He might be able to pull DNA.

00:16:53,139 --> 00:16:54,407
Look at this.

00:16:54,473 --> 00:16:57,376
Incise defect
on the left fifth rib.

00:16:57,443 --> 00:16:58,811
Incise defect
on the left third rib.

00:16:58,878 --> 00:17:00,980
GRISSOM:
Well, the tool marks
appear consistent

00:17:01,047 --> 00:17:01,981
with each other.

00:17:02,048 --> 00:17:03,783
Probably made
before decomposition,

00:17:03,849 --> 00:17:07,319
and not from hitting any
obstruction in the sewer line.

00:17:07,386 --> 00:17:08,487
Stab wounds.

00:17:08,554 --> 00:17:12,892
<i>Two separate strikes</i>
<i>back to front</i>

00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:14,427
would have punctured the lung.

00:17:14,493 --> 00:17:16,328
What about age?

00:17:16,395 --> 00:17:18,931
I'll let you know.

00:17:24,704 --> 00:17:28,407
Okay, let's start with the
houses within eyeshot

00:17:28,474 --> 00:17:29,642
of the manhole,

00:17:29,709 --> 00:17:32,611
and then we'll work our way out
from there. Hmm? Okay.

00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,382
You really, really ought
to have the one

00:17:36,449 --> 00:17:37,583
with chocolate icing.

00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:39,452
Hello, Officer.

00:17:39,518 --> 00:17:40,586
Oh, dear.

00:17:40,653 --> 00:17:41,887
Detective.

00:17:41,954 --> 00:17:44,190
Detective. Sorry, I...

00:17:44,256 --> 00:17:46,726
Uh, just a little something
for you and your boys,

00:17:46,792 --> 00:17:49,528
uh, a token of appreciation
for local law enforcement.

00:17:49,595 --> 00:17:50,930
You mind standing
behind the tape?

00:17:50,996 --> 00:17:52,031
It's for your own safety.

00:17:52,098 --> 00:17:53,632
There you go.

00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:56,635
Go ahead.

00:17:56,702 --> 00:17:58,070
Coffee's fresh.

00:17:58,137 --> 00:17:59,205
Didn't even spit in it.

00:17:59,271 --> 00:18:00,272
( <i>laughs</i> )

00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:05,444
Not that I ever would.
I, I love cops.

00:18:05,511 --> 00:18:06,445
What's your name?

00:18:06,512 --> 00:18:08,514
Marty, uh, Martin Kessler.

00:18:08,581 --> 00:18:09,648
I live here...

00:18:09,715 --> 00:18:12,418
there, right over there,
number 2305.

00:18:12,485 --> 00:18:16,989
So, uh, does this have anything
to do with the missing cats?

00:18:17,056 --> 00:18:19,158
People have lost
a lot of pets

00:18:19,225 --> 00:18:20,426
in this neighborhood.

00:18:20,493 --> 00:18:22,228
Too many,
if you get my drift.

00:18:22,294 --> 00:18:23,262
Well, you know, Marty,

00:18:23,329 --> 00:18:24,830
I'm really not at
liberty to say.

00:18:24,897 --> 00:18:27,400
But did you see anybody throw
any stuff down that sewer?

00:18:27,466 --> 00:18:28,467
Not personally,

00:18:28,534 --> 00:18:32,138
but, uh, I know kids around here
throw fireworks...

00:18:32,204 --> 00:18:34,340
illegal, down there.

00:18:34,407 --> 00:18:36,442
Kaboom! Kaboom!

00:18:36,509 --> 00:18:39,278
4:00 in the morning.

00:18:39,345 --> 00:18:41,213
Kids have no respect
for the law.

00:19:00,366 --> 00:19:01,934
I heard you finally lost
your virginity.

00:19:03,369 --> 00:19:05,104
First autopsy. How was it?

00:19:05,171 --> 00:19:07,139
It was fine.

00:19:07,206 --> 00:19:08,507
How was your first time?

00:19:08,574 --> 00:19:09,508
How did you react?

00:19:09,575 --> 00:19:12,244
I puked.

00:19:13,612 --> 00:19:14,547
I didn't puke.

00:19:14,613 --> 00:19:16,415
Way to go, tough guy.

00:19:18,818 --> 00:19:22,788
It was weird, seeing a body
laying on a table like that.

00:19:22,855 --> 00:19:25,424
Doc Robbins just pulling out
his insides

00:19:25,491 --> 00:19:28,394
until it was all empty.

00:19:28,461 --> 00:19:30,296
Were you expecting
a ball of light?

00:19:31,697 --> 00:19:33,799
Doc Robbins said,
"That's all we really are."

00:19:33,866 --> 00:19:36,168
It's what you do
with it that counts.

00:19:39,271 --> 00:19:40,906
Victim had
incomplete formation

00:19:40,973 --> 00:19:43,175
of the second molar
root tips,

00:19:43,242 --> 00:19:46,345
and his wisdom teeth
hadn't erupted.

00:19:46,412 --> 00:19:47,346
Teenager.

00:19:47,413 --> 00:19:49,749
Yeah, approximately
13 to 15.

00:19:49,815 --> 00:19:53,386
Eye orbits rounded,
almost oval.

00:19:53,452 --> 00:19:56,822
Nasal aperture
narrow and tall,
jawline flat.

00:19:56,889 --> 00:19:58,224
Likely Caucasian.

00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:01,060
Uh, dental records
are out to NCIC.

00:20:01,127 --> 00:20:02,161
That's all I've got.

00:20:02,228 --> 00:20:03,229
How'd Greg do?

00:20:03,295 --> 00:20:04,563
Bones are too degraded.

00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:06,499
No viable DNA,
not even in the teeth.

00:20:06,565 --> 00:20:08,401
Well, it's a bit of a long shot.

00:20:08,467 --> 00:20:09,835
Sewer's a chemical stew.

00:20:09,902 --> 00:20:13,339
Maybe Catherine
will get lucky with
Missing Persons.

00:20:13,406 --> 00:20:15,007
STOKES:
Okay, I opened the age range

00:20:15,074 --> 00:20:17,209
to give us a better margin
for error.

00:20:17,276 --> 00:20:19,478
Currently 47

of 12 and 16

00:20:21,847 --> 00:20:25,985
missing from the Greater
Las Vegas Metro district.

00:20:26,052 --> 00:20:27,553
Okay. Geography first?

00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,822
Mm‐hmm.

00:20:29,889 --> 00:20:31,257
Body was found here.

00:20:31,323 --> 00:20:33,893
These are the last‐known
residences

00:20:33,959 --> 00:20:36,562
of the missing persons.

00:20:36,629 --> 00:20:38,698
There's no one
particularly close.

00:20:38,764 --> 00:20:40,232
I'll narrow it down.

00:20:40,299 --> 00:20:42,401
Two‐mile radius.

00:20:42,468 --> 00:20:46,572
Missing five weeks,
eleven weeks,

00:20:46,639 --> 00:20:48,374
eleven months.

00:20:48,441 --> 00:20:49,408
That's not long enough.

00:20:49,475 --> 00:20:51,010
The condition of the bones
suggested

00:20:51,077 --> 00:20:53,312
the body's been decomposing
for at least two years.

00:20:53,379 --> 00:20:55,147
Okay, I'll go wider.

00:20:55,214 --> 00:20:56,549
Five miles.

00:21:12,365 --> 00:21:13,733
What are you doing?

00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:15,468
Good. You're here.

00:21:15,534 --> 00:21:17,470
Fill this up
for me, will ya?

00:21:17,536 --> 00:21:19,438
With what?

00:21:19,505 --> 00:21:20,840
It's a urine specimen cup, Greg.

00:21:20,906 --> 00:21:21,907
What do you think?

00:21:21,974 --> 00:21:24,710
( <i>scoffs</i> )

00:21:24,777 --> 00:21:25,878
Okay.

00:21:49,235 --> 00:21:51,404
That took a long time.

00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:52,538
You may need a prostate exam.

00:21:52,605 --> 00:21:54,206
My prostate is just fine.

00:21:54,273 --> 00:21:56,275
I'm not a soda fountain.

00:21:56,342 --> 00:21:57,309
Hopefully you are,

00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:59,345
'cause I need a number two
as quickly as possible.

00:22:02,415 --> 00:22:04,583
What is this all about?

00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:06,852
The victim's body was found
in a sewer.

00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:08,754
Ambient temperature 80 degrees.

00:22:08,821 --> 00:22:10,589
The corrosive chemicals caused
the body

00:22:10,656 --> 00:22:12,191
to decompose faster than normal.

00:22:12,258 --> 00:22:14,627
I want to find out
how much faster.

00:22:16,095 --> 00:22:17,963
Today.

00:22:20,232 --> 00:22:24,136
This is some kind of CSI hazing.

00:22:24,203 --> 00:22:26,906
Make me appreciate blood
and semen more.

00:22:26,972 --> 00:22:29,241
I mean, since we don't
have a solid time frame,

00:22:29,308 --> 00:22:30,943
it's kind of tough
to jog memories.

00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:32,278
But nobody saw anybody

00:22:32,344 --> 00:22:34,947
throw anything like a
body down that manhole.

00:22:35,014 --> 00:22:38,017
But several people suggested
we talk to this high school kid,

00:22:38,084 --> 00:22:39,218
Owen Durbin.

00:22:39,285 --> 00:22:40,619
Now, he's a neighborhood bully.

00:22:40,686 --> 00:22:43,289
He likes to throw cherry bombs
in there and hear 'em go boom.

00:22:43,355 --> 00:22:45,491
Uh, guys, how are
we supposed to get
through the door?

00:22:45,558 --> 00:22:48,461
There's no evidence
linking this kid
to the bones.

00:22:48,527 --> 00:22:50,730
We're not looking for bones.

00:22:50,796 --> 00:22:53,699
Illegal use of fireworks?
This is crap.

00:22:53,766 --> 00:22:55,568
We've had several complaints
from your neighbors, sir.

00:22:55,634 --> 00:22:56,969
No one's complained to me.

00:22:57,036 --> 00:22:58,137
Well, ( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:22:58,204 --> 00:23:00,539
this is gonna happen,
so please step outside.

00:23:00,606 --> 00:23:01,907
Ask your family
to come with you.

00:23:01,974 --> 00:23:03,109
Thank you.

00:23:04,143 --> 00:23:06,145
Come on, guys.

00:23:06,212 --> 00:23:08,080
Let's go.

00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:13,953
Anything happens
in here,

00:23:14,019 --> 00:23:15,421
it's your fault.

00:23:16,489 --> 00:23:17,790
Okay.

00:23:33,439 --> 00:23:34,940
Whoa.

00:23:35,007 --> 00:23:39,245
Lot of ammo here,
all different caliber.

00:23:39,311 --> 00:23:42,181
Means multiple weapons
are present... somewhere.

00:23:42,248 --> 00:23:43,983
BROWN:
Yeah?

00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:46,986
I got a shotgun
under the couch.

00:23:50,923 --> 00:23:52,658
Oh, yeah.

00:23:56,896 --> 00:23:59,298
Loaded.

( <i>dogs barking</i> )

00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:07,840
Sounds like we got
some nasty dogs out back.

00:24:25,257 --> 00:24:27,526
I think I got blood.

00:24:36,602 --> 00:24:40,773
( <i>dogs barking</i> )

00:24:48,013 --> 00:24:49,315
Confirmed.

00:24:49,382 --> 00:24:51,484
Okay. I'm gonna get
the warrant amended

00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:53,719
for blood evidence collection.
Until then...

00:24:53,786 --> 00:24:55,221
We stop searching.

00:24:55,287 --> 00:24:56,489
Won't take long,
so hang loose.

00:24:56,555 --> 00:24:57,923
And I'll get
the Animal Control

00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:59,225
to get these mutts
out of here.

00:25:05,064 --> 00:25:08,334
So, uh, no searching.

00:25:08,401 --> 00:25:10,036
Yeah, right.

00:25:37,296 --> 00:25:38,798
That closet's well stocked, huh?

00:25:53,813 --> 00:25:55,214
Sara?

00:25:55,281 --> 00:25:57,116
I'm not touching anything.

00:25:57,183 --> 00:26:01,921
No. Put your stuff down
and step away from the closet.

00:26:01,987 --> 00:26:03,789
What?

00:26:03,856 --> 00:26:05,057
Put down your stuff

00:26:05,124 --> 00:26:07,760
and step away
from the closet.

00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:20,740
SIDLE:
Those are pipe bombs.

00:26:20,806 --> 00:26:22,274
Yeah.

00:26:26,479 --> 00:26:27,646
this is CSI Brown.

00:26:27,713 --> 00:26:29,348
We're at the Durbin
residence.

00:26:29,415 --> 00:26:31,150
We have explosives
on the scene.

00:26:31,217 --> 00:26:32,685
Roll out Bomb Squad immediately.

00:26:32,752 --> 00:26:34,987
Roll out Bomb Squad.

00:26:35,054 --> 00:26:36,922
What are you doing?

00:26:36,989 --> 00:26:39,358
There's blood evidence
on the door.

00:26:39,425 --> 00:26:41,127
If the bomb squad
detonates the place,

00:26:41,193 --> 00:26:42,595
it's gone.
Sara.

00:26:42,661 --> 00:26:45,297
It'll only take a second.

00:26:52,738 --> 00:26:54,273
Here, try this.

It's stuck.

00:27:15,361 --> 00:27:17,463
I think we're gonna
need a little push.

00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:19,598
( <i>sighs</i> ):
All right.

00:27:19,665 --> 00:27:22,668
On three.

( <i>camera clicking</i> )

00:27:46,125 --> 00:27:48,327
Let's go over again
what you found on the scene.

00:27:48,394 --> 00:27:49,862
Six pipe bombs.

00:27:49,929 --> 00:27:51,463
Anything else?

00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:53,465
Not that we know of.

00:27:53,532 --> 00:27:57,469
Give me another 50 yards, okay!

00:27:57,536 --> 00:27:58,971
That includes you.

00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:00,806
You got it.

00:28:03,175 --> 00:28:04,910
BRASS:
<i>So tell me something...</i>

00:28:04,977 --> 00:28:07,680
what's a guy who
sells life insurance

00:28:07,746 --> 00:28:10,182
doing with a half
a dozen pipe bombs?

00:28:10,249 --> 00:28:11,717
Huh?

00:28:11,784 --> 00:28:13,686
I mean, you got a grudge
against the government?

00:28:13,752 --> 00:28:14,987
Is this a Timothy
McVeigh thing?

00:28:15,054 --> 00:28:17,089
<i>Or... you just have</i>
<i>a weird fascination</i>

00:28:17,156 --> 00:28:18,891
<i>with watching things go boom?</i>

00:28:18,958 --> 00:28:20,659
I've never been
arrested for anything.

00:28:20,726 --> 00:28:22,161
I've never hurt anybody.

00:28:22,228 --> 00:28:23,162
You got a wife and a kid.

00:28:23,229 --> 00:28:24,463
Aren't you afraid
they might get hurt?

00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:25,965
Well, I don't know about you,

00:28:26,031 --> 00:28:27,600
but in my house, there's rules.

00:28:27,666 --> 00:28:29,935
Terry and Owen know what to do
and what not to do.

00:28:30,002 --> 00:28:31,937
BRASS:
<i>Well, clearly you don't.</i>

00:28:32,004 --> 00:28:33,339
<i>The bombs are a Class‐B felony.</i>

00:28:33,405 --> 00:28:35,608
The penalty is one
to six years in prison

00:28:35,674 --> 00:28:37,309
for each device.

00:28:37,376 --> 00:28:39,578
And murder is 25 to life.

00:28:39,645 --> 00:28:41,480
Somebody gets blown up,

00:28:41,547 --> 00:28:42,681
<i>it's nothing to do with me.</i>

00:28:42,748 --> 00:28:45,084
<i>I told you</i>
<i>not to go in my house.</i>

00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:46,452
We found blood
in your house.

00:28:46,518 --> 00:28:48,153
Then you must have put it there.

00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,555
Oh, yeah?
How about this?

00:28:49,622 --> 00:28:53,125
We found a body in the sewer
in front of your house.

00:28:53,192 --> 00:28:57,129
Did we put
that there?

00:28:57,196 --> 00:28:59,698
I don't know anything about it.

00:28:59,765 --> 00:29:02,167
So what were you trying
to prove with this door?

00:29:02,234 --> 00:29:05,504
I was just
collecting evidence.

00:29:05,571 --> 00:29:07,806
Well, Greg couldn't pull
any DNA from the bones,

00:29:07,873 --> 00:29:10,309
so there's nothing to connect
the victim to this anyway.

00:29:10,376 --> 00:29:11,710
Not yet.

00:29:14,246 --> 00:29:15,781
I don't have a death wish,

00:29:15,848 --> 00:29:18,817
and I'm not a drunk,
in case you were worried.

00:29:18,884 --> 00:29:22,488
I'm not worried.

00:29:22,555 --> 00:29:24,056
I'm concerned.

00:29:30,029 --> 00:29:33,232
Isn't that kind of
the same thing?

00:29:39,305 --> 00:29:40,673
Oh...

GRISSOM:
<i>How are you doing</i>
<i>with victim ID?</i>

00:29:48,047 --> 00:29:50,149
So far we've followed up
on 11 missing persons

00:29:50,215 --> 00:29:51,250
who fit the profile,

00:29:51,317 --> 00:29:53,152
ruled out every one
by case history.

00:29:53,218 --> 00:29:54,486
What's the most
recent case?

00:29:54,553 --> 00:29:55,988
Well, we're only
looking at people

00:29:56,055 --> 00:29:57,556
who've been missing
more than a year.

00:29:57,623 --> 00:29:58,757
The condition of
the bones...

00:29:58,824 --> 00:29:59,925
Was misleading.

00:29:59,992 --> 00:30:02,761
Tissue in a sewer decomposes
20 times faster than normal.

00:30:02,828 --> 00:30:05,431
The victim could be missing
as little as five weeks.

00:30:35,494 --> 00:30:37,363
Are we clear to get back
in there?

00:30:37,429 --> 00:30:38,430
We're not through.

00:30:38,497 --> 00:30:39,765
We swept the house
for booby traps.

00:30:39,832 --> 00:30:42,067
It was clean, but we still
haven't done a full search yet.

00:30:42,134 --> 00:30:43,869
Well, why don't you
clear an area

00:30:43,936 --> 00:30:45,571
and we'll process behind you.

00:30:45,638 --> 00:30:47,873
Scene will still be under
my authority.

00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:50,276
I don't have a problem
with authority.

00:30:50,342 --> 00:30:51,610
Fire in the hole!

00:30:56,315 --> 00:30:59,451
This is Travis's
ninth grade picture.

00:30:59,518 --> 00:31:03,422
His father, my son,
was a punk.

00:31:03,489 --> 00:31:06,191
He, uh, skipped out
just after Travis was born.

00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:11,063
His mother's in Salt Lake.
She's a junkie.

00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:14,066
The only time
she ever called Travis

00:31:14,133 --> 00:31:16,502
was to use him
to get money out of me.

00:31:16,569 --> 00:31:19,338
I mean, she can barely take care
of herself, let alone a kid.

00:31:19,405 --> 00:31:21,974
You know how many times
I told him that.

00:31:22,041 --> 00:31:23,475
Well, most of the time
kids believe

00:31:23,542 --> 00:31:25,878
what they want to believe,
you know.

00:31:25,945 --> 00:31:28,113
Did he run off to see his mom?

00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:30,282
Mm. Yeah, it wasn't
the first time.

00:31:30,349 --> 00:31:35,287
He's, uh... About six weeks ago,
I come home to a note.

00:31:35,354 --> 00:31:37,256
So I called his mom, and...

00:31:37,323 --> 00:31:39,158
He just never,
he never showed up.

00:31:39,225 --> 00:31:44,230
Ms. Giles, do you, uh,
do you recognize this boy?

00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:48,000
No.

00:31:48,067 --> 00:31:49,134
No?
Mm‐mm.

00:31:50,402 --> 00:31:53,105
Do you have anything of Travis's
he might have used on his body?

00:31:53,172 --> 00:31:56,942
Like a toothbrush, hairbrush,
anything like that?

00:31:57,009 --> 00:31:58,911
No, he took all that kind of
thing with him when he left.

00:31:58,978 --> 00:31:59,778
Mmm.

00:31:59,845 --> 00:32:00,846
Why?

00:32:00,913 --> 00:32:02,147
Well, it would help

00:32:02,214 --> 00:32:03,215
if I could get a sample

00:32:03,282 --> 00:32:04,984
of Travis's DNA.

00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:06,051

ma'am, I don't really
know how to say this...

00:32:10,289 --> 00:32:11,290
Don't bother.

00:32:11,357 --> 00:32:13,893
I know he's dead.

00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:18,464
Is this a classmate of yours,
Owen?

00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:20,065
No.

00:32:20,132 --> 00:32:21,233
Okay, let's try that again.

00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:24,069
You two went to the same middle
school, right?

00:32:24,136 --> 00:32:27,406
Maybe. I guess.

00:32:27,473 --> 00:32:29,808
You guess. Were you friends?

00:32:29,875 --> 00:32:31,644
I know my son's friends.

00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:33,345
That's not one of them.

00:32:33,412 --> 00:32:35,314
Mrs. Durbin,

00:32:35,381 --> 00:32:36,782
may I speak with you
for a minute in private?

00:32:36,849 --> 00:32:38,484
Excuse us, Owen.

00:32:43,489 --> 00:32:46,358
You know, sometimes kids
get self‐conscious

00:32:46,425 --> 00:32:47,493
around their parents.

00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:50,963
Maybe it would be better
if I spoke to Owen by myself.

00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:52,932
He'll have an
advocate present

00:32:52,998 --> 00:32:55,868
to make sure his rights
are respected. Okay?

00:32:58,704 --> 00:33:02,608
I'm not leaving my son
alone with you.

00:33:02,675 --> 00:33:04,443
My husband
wouldn't like that.

00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:26,799
Medium‐velocity spatter.

00:33:26,865 --> 00:33:29,168
This looks like the point
of origin.

00:33:42,648 --> 00:33:45,851
( <i>dialing phone</i> )

00:33:45,918 --> 00:33:48,020
Yeah, this is Catherine Willows
for Captain Brass.

00:33:51,557 --> 00:33:54,593
Tell me about the blood
in your house.

00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:57,496
Blood? Where?

00:33:57,563 --> 00:34:00,633
Well, the top of the
stairs for starters.

00:34:00,699 --> 00:34:01,934
I don't know what

00:34:02,001 --> 00:34:03,836
you're talking about.

00:34:05,971 --> 00:34:06,906
You do.

00:34:06,972 --> 00:34:09,575
I don't.

00:34:09,642 --> 00:34:10,943
Maybe it's the dogs'.

00:34:12,378 --> 00:34:15,114
When they go upstairs sometimes,
sometimes they fight.

00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,315
They fight a lot.

00:34:18,217 --> 00:34:21,520
SIDLE:
Animal Control said the Durbins'
pit bulls showed no signs

00:34:21,587 --> 00:34:23,255
of recent injury.

00:34:23,322 --> 00:34:24,356
Dogs heal fast.

00:34:24,423 --> 00:34:26,692
I guess I'll go back to the lab
and get a hematrace.

00:34:26,759 --> 00:34:27,693
Don't bother.

00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,727
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:34:28,794 --> 00:34:30,763
The lowest point of spatter is
46 inches above the ground

00:34:30,829 --> 00:34:31,931
with a downward angle.

00:34:31,997 --> 00:34:34,133
Even if those dogs
could walk upright,

00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,868
they couldn't have done this.

00:34:35,935 --> 00:34:37,169
Kid's a liar.

00:34:41,907 --> 00:34:44,076
( <i>garbled radio transmission)</i>

00:34:58,917 --> 00:35:00,792
I'm not done yet.

00:35:01,625 --> 00:35:03,360
Take your time.

00:35:04,291 --> 00:35:05,957
Got some det
cord here.

00:35:05,957 --> 00:35:07,625
Isn't that high explosive?

00:35:07,709 --> 00:35:10,912
Stuff designed to be humped
around by grunts.

00:35:10,979 --> 00:35:12,380
You gotta want it go off.

00:35:12,447 --> 00:35:15,250
Only one thing you need
to worry about.

00:35:15,317 --> 00:35:19,988
Ever see me running,
make sure you keep up.

00:35:20,055 --> 00:35:21,323
Got it.

00:35:47,249 --> 00:35:48,316
( <i>shutter snaps</i> )

00:36:23,652 --> 00:36:24,953
( <i>shutter snaps</i> )

00:36:49,544 --> 00:36:53,048
GRISSOM:
Hey, Rick, watch your step.

00:36:54,749 --> 00:36:57,485
This could be blood evidence
on the floor.

00:36:59,654 --> 00:37:01,423
Okay, Grissom,

00:37:01,489 --> 00:37:03,158
I located some
burnt clothes

00:37:03,225 --> 00:37:04,926
in a barrel
out in the back.

00:37:04,993 --> 00:37:07,429
I'm thinking he was killed
in the house,

00:37:07,496 --> 00:37:10,098
dragged out back
and then dumped.

00:37:10,165 --> 00:37:12,033
GRISSOM:
He might have been dragged
in here.

00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,602
Make sure you bag that stuff.

00:37:13,668 --> 00:37:15,470
Yeah, I'm all over it.

00:37:48,003 --> 00:37:50,138
Don't touch a thing.

00:37:50,205 --> 00:37:51,239
Get out now.

00:37:51,306 --> 00:37:54,409
Uh, I think I have
some evidence back here.

00:37:54,476 --> 00:37:56,778
Clear out now.

00:37:58,113 --> 00:37:59,314
Hey!

00:37:59,381 --> 00:38:01,349
The garage is packed
with liquid explosives.

00:38:01,416 --> 00:38:03,418
They're gonna detonate in place.

00:38:03,485 --> 00:38:06,087
So grab what's important
and get out now.

00:38:06,154 --> 00:38:07,889
That means you, too, Sara.

00:38:07,956 --> 00:38:09,457
Right now.

00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:34,616
MAN:
Fire in the hole!

00:38:34,683 --> 00:38:36,151
Fire in the hole!

00:38:43,758 --> 00:38:44,726
Sons of bitches!

00:38:44,793 --> 00:38:47,195
I'm gonna sue your ass
into the ground.

00:38:47,262 --> 00:38:48,563
I hope you know that.

00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:49,998
Yeah. I'm gonna own you.

00:38:50,065 --> 00:38:51,533
I'm gonna own this whole place.

00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,401
In fact, maybe that's where
I'll live.

00:38:53,468 --> 00:38:54,836
I'm just gonna
move in here.

00:38:54,903 --> 00:38:56,338
Let me guess.
He lawyered up.

00:38:56,404 --> 00:38:58,507
Yeah, he stopped talking
after I told him

00:38:58,573 --> 00:38:59,641
we blew up his house.

00:38:59,708 --> 00:39:01,977
And what about the wife and son?

00:39:02,043 --> 00:39:03,078
They're still in play.

00:39:03,144 --> 00:39:04,779
How much longer
is anybody's guess.

00:39:04,846 --> 00:39:06,848
But, uh, we need something more
to go back at them with.

00:39:06,915 --> 00:39:08,783
Well, I think at this point

00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:12,153
we can agree that the murder
weapon was a knife.

00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:14,890
These are pictures of a box
of knives

00:39:14,956 --> 00:39:17,192
that I was unable to recover
from the Durbin garage.

00:39:20,028 --> 00:39:21,663
So how about the tool marks?

00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:25,233
I cast the stab marks
in the victim's ribs.

00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:28,236
Bone deterioration removed all
the individual characteristics.

00:39:28,303 --> 00:39:31,039
The best we can do
is rule out the
serrated blade.

00:39:31,106 --> 00:39:33,875
Hey, what about
the kid's videos?

00:39:33,942 --> 00:39:36,711
Uh, no tape of the murder
or body he dumped so far.

00:39:36,778 --> 00:39:38,246
I'm not holding my breath.

00:39:38,313 --> 00:39:39,881
Videos cover several years.

00:39:39,948 --> 00:39:41,049
Kid running around the house.

00:39:41,116 --> 00:39:42,384
Backyard barbecue kind of stuff.

00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:45,587
You know,
home movies.

00:39:45,654 --> 00:39:46,922
A teenage boy with a shoe box
full of home movies

00:39:46,988 --> 00:39:47,989
under his bed?

00:39:48,056 --> 00:39:49,191
It's weird, I know.

00:39:49,257 --> 00:39:50,392
I'm still looking.

00:39:50,458 --> 00:39:53,428
Well, we know Owen went to
school with Travis Giles, right?

00:39:53,495 --> 00:39:55,163
Well, that was a few years back,

00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:57,599
and we still can't place Travis
at the house.

00:39:57,666 --> 00:39:59,634
With all the fire damage,
the clothes are the right size,

00:39:59,701 --> 00:40:01,369
but I couldn't get any blood
evidence off of it.

00:40:01,436 --> 00:40:02,537
Even if we had that,

00:40:02,604 --> 00:40:04,573
we still don't have
a blood standard for Travis.

00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:06,875
I mean, we can't even positively
ID the victim.

00:40:14,916 --> 00:40:16,818
Miss Giles? Hi.

00:40:16,885 --> 00:40:18,887
What can I do for you?

00:40:18,954 --> 00:40:21,523
I wasn't able to find a
hairbrush or a toothbrush,

00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:23,291
but the only thing
I have left

00:40:23,358 --> 00:40:25,026
of Travis's is...

00:40:25,093 --> 00:40:27,863
this.

00:40:30,265 --> 00:40:34,569
When he was little,
I used to be his tooth fairy.

00:40:37,672 --> 00:40:40,175
DNA from Travis Giles' tooth
matched the blood

00:40:40,242 --> 00:40:41,776
that we found in your house.

00:40:41,843 --> 00:40:44,946
BRASS:
And now you're gonna
tell us how it got there.

00:40:45,013 --> 00:40:47,716
I don't know.

00:40:47,782 --> 00:40:48,917
Kids get hurt all the time.

00:40:48,984 --> 00:40:51,019
They fall down,
cut themselves...

00:40:51,086 --> 00:40:53,388
get nosebleeds.

00:40:53,455 --> 00:40:54,990
BRASS:
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

00:40:55,056 --> 00:40:56,758
Wait a minute.

00:40:56,825 --> 00:40:57,859
What are you telling me,

00:40:57,926 --> 00:40:59,361
that a kid
that you've never seen,

00:40:59,427 --> 00:41:01,263
a kid who's not even friends
with your son,

00:41:01,329 --> 00:41:03,231
got a nosebleed in your house?

00:41:03,298 --> 00:41:05,467
Huh?

00:41:05,534 --> 00:41:06,601
You're lying.

00:41:06,668 --> 00:41:07,969
You know,
we can make this quick,

00:41:08,036 --> 00:41:09,337
'cause I got enough
to arrest you right now.

00:41:09,404 --> 00:41:10,872
Look, it was an accident.

00:41:11,973 --> 00:41:14,509
All right,
Travis came over one night,

00:41:14,576 --> 00:41:16,344
said he wanted to buy a knife.

00:41:16,411 --> 00:41:18,914
<i>So I gave him a knife.</i>

00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:20,015
<i>He said he couldn't pay.</i>

00:41:20,081 --> 00:41:21,149
<i>He tried to run.</i>

00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,389
Wasn't moving,
he was just lying there,

00:41:27,455 --> 00:41:28,456
knife stuck in him.

00:41:28,523 --> 00:41:30,125
Now you're lying.

00:41:31,927 --> 00:41:33,161
Don't you call my son a liar.

00:41:33,228 --> 00:41:35,564
Travis was stabbed twice.

00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:37,699
That's not possible
if he just fell on the knife.

00:41:37,766 --> 00:41:38,867
BRASS:
So what happened?

00:41:38,934 --> 00:41:40,001
He piss you off?

00:41:40,068 --> 00:41:41,603
Get in a fight?

00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:43,672
Maybe called you
a mama's boy?

00:41:43,738 --> 00:41:46,041
Or did you just want to see what
it felt like to stab somebody?

00:41:46,107 --> 00:41:47,576
Like I told you,
it was an accident.

00:41:47,642 --> 00:41:48,610
Then why did you dump the body
down a sewer

00:41:48,677 --> 00:41:49,845
in the middle of the night?

00:41:49,911 --> 00:41:51,680
He didn't.

00:41:51,746 --> 00:41:52,948
He didn't do it alone.

00:41:53,014 --> 00:41:55,550
We found the victim's charred
clothing folded.

00:41:55,617 --> 00:41:57,652
Kids don't fold anything,
mothers do.

00:41:57,719 --> 00:41:59,721
You helped him clean up
the mess.

00:41:59,788 --> 00:42:00,989
Yeah, that's kind of funny,

00:42:01,056 --> 00:42:03,758
because, um, you're not much
of a housekeeper.

00:42:06,428 --> 00:42:09,130
If you talk to my mother
like that again,

00:42:09,197 --> 00:42:10,932
I'll kill you.

00:42:12,267 --> 00:42:13,835
Don't you say
another word, baby.

00:42:13,902 --> 00:42:15,904
I'll kill both of you.

00:42:17,539 --> 00:42:19,341
I want a lawyer.

00:42:19,407 --> 00:42:22,544
Well, we really don't need
a confession.

00:42:22,611 --> 00:42:27,649
Well, the kid gets murder,
mom's an accessory,

00:42:27,716 --> 00:42:31,820
and Dad gets felony explosives.

00:42:31,887 --> 00:42:33,855
It's a family‐value pack.

00:42:33,922 --> 00:42:35,123
Well, it's appropriate.

00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:37,759
One way or another,
they each had a hand in it.

00:42:37,826 --> 00:42:39,694
MOTHER:
Come on, Roger.
Do we have to?

00:42:39,761 --> 00:42:42,230
Just keep the camera on it,
will ya?

00:42:43,765 --> 00:42:45,100
Watch.

00:42:45,167 --> 00:42:46,368
( <i>frog croaks</i> )

( <i>laughs</i> )

00:42:48,803 --> 00:42:51,540
Violent environment,
oblivious mother,

00:42:51,606 --> 00:42:52,774
disturbed child.

00:42:52,841 --> 00:42:54,743
Here, stir this.

00:42:54,809 --> 00:42:56,211
What's it for?

00:42:56,278 --> 00:42:57,345
Blowing stuff up.

00:42:57,412 --> 00:42:58,613
( <i>laughs</i> )

00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:03,919
But you know, no matter how bad
your kid turns out,

00:43:03,985 --> 00:43:06,254
it never changes how you feel
about him.

00:43:07,589 --> 00:43:09,758
Unconditional love between
parents and offspring

00:43:09,824 --> 00:43:14,095
is biological,
perpetuates the species.

00:43:16,965 --> 00:43:19,568
Go ahead.
That's good.

00:43:19,634 --> 00:43:23,305
That's good.
Get it good.
