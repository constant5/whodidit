Dakota always calls me.

We have a system.

It's a...

It's a family matter.
I didn't know

00:02:28,045 --> 00:02:29,814
you had a family.
Well, you're new.

I, uh,

I got no backup.

I'm still learning
the ropes here.

00:02:44,128 --> 00:02:45,630
( <i>chuckles</i> ):
Well, it's never a good time

00:02:45,696 --> 00:02:47,865
to have a family problem,
Sheriff.

00:02:47,932 --> 00:02:49,667
Look, I don't ask
for time off normally.

00:02:49,734 --> 00:02:50,968
I'd appreciate the courtesy.

00:02:51,035 --> 00:02:53,371
Do I have a

00:02:53,437 --> 00:02:55,206
Get back here as

You look good, Jimmy.

You do, too, Annie.

00:03:46,557 --> 00:03:48,292
L.A. seems to agree with you.

00:03:48,359 --> 00:03:49,961
Oh, yeah, well,

00:03:50,027 --> 00:03:51,762
I couldn't take
another Jersey winter.

00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:53,831
Or another Jersey cop.

00:03:53,898 --> 00:03:55,266
You stay in touch
with the old crew?

00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:58,236
You know, dirty cops don't like
to hang with clean ones.

00:03:58,302 --> 00:04:00,071
So that's why
they called me squeaky?

00:04:00,137 --> 00:04:02,473
I thought
what you did took a lot of guts.

00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,976
Integrity is, um,

00:04:05,042 --> 00:04:07,178
hard to come by in vice.

00:04:07,245 --> 00:04:09,180
Yeah, it's the only detail
where you're told

00:04:09,247 --> 00:04:10,848
to drink, gamble
and pick up hookers,

00:04:10,915 --> 00:04:12,049

00:04:16,687 --> 00:04:18,689
So, you got my message?

00:04:18,756 --> 00:04:19,690
My daughter Ellie

00:04:19,757 --> 00:04:21,459
and her friend Dakota
were out partying

00:04:21,525 --> 00:04:23,160
and Dakota got
in some guy's car.

00:04:23,227 --> 00:04:25,229
Ellie was able
to pull a partial.

00:04:25,296 --> 00:04:27,164

00:04:34,739 --> 00:04:37,742
In the meantime,
I pulled Dakota's rap sheet.

00:04:38,776 --> 00:04:40,278
She has a sheet?

00:04:40,344 --> 00:04:42,980
They both do.

00:04:43,047 --> 00:04:46,183
She, uh, works a stretch

00:04:49,053 --> 00:04:50,855
When was the last time
you saw Ellie, Jimmy?

00:04:50,922 --> 00:04:52,056
About three years ago.

00:04:52,123 --> 00:04:53,724
Um, she got into some trouble
in Vegas.

Hanging around
with a bad bunch.

00:04:55,192 --> 00:04:57,361

00:10:46,611 --> 00:10:47,578
But we found
the car.

00:10:47,645 --> 00:10:49,080
So she could still be alive?

00:10:49,146 --> 00:10:50,548
We found blood
in the trunk.

00:10:50,615 --> 00:10:51,916
No, no, no, she's alive.

00:10:51,983 --> 00:10:53,084
I can feel it.

00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:55,086
Look, do you have anything
with her DNA on it,

00:10:55,152 --> 00:10:56,787
like a hair brush
or toothbrush or...?

00:10:56,854 --> 00:10:58,122
No.

00:10:58,189 --> 00:10:59,957
We keep all that stuff
in our purse.

00:11:00,024 --> 00:11:02,260
How about clothes or sheets
or pillowcases, like that?

00:11:02,326 --> 00:11:04,295
We share everything else.

00:11:04,362 --> 00:11:06,197
Even the bed?

00:11:06,264 --> 00:11:07,932
I told you
I'm not playing that game.

00:11:07,999 --> 00:11:09,033
If the lab
doesn't have

00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,668
anything to match the blood to,

00:11:10,735 --> 00:11:12,470
then we'll never know.
That's it.

00:11:13,504 --> 00:11:14,872
( <i>sniffles</i> )

00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,176
Come on, let's get some dinner,
huh?

00:11:19,243 --> 00:11:20,978
You look hungry.

00:11:21,045 --> 00:11:23,014
Wait. Blood.

00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,016
We went and got tested
last week

00:11:25,082 --> 00:11:27,018
at the Free Clinic on Ivar.

00:11:27,084 --> 00:11:29,053
Maybe they keep it.

00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,222
Tested for what?

00:11:31,289 --> 00:11:33,591
What do you think?

00:11:33,658 --> 00:11:35,626
Don't you use
protection?

00:11:35,693 --> 00:11:38,829
Guys pay extra for bareback.

00:11:40,665 --> 00:11:41,966
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:11:42,033 --> 00:11:43,367
You're a lot

00:11:43,434 --> 00:11:44,769
smarter than that, Ellie.
Come on.

00:11:44,835 --> 00:11:45,836
Yeah, well, just because

00:11:45,903 --> 00:11:47,138
you want me to be smarter

00:11:47,204 --> 00:11:49,240
and sweeter and safer
doesn't mean I am.

00:11:49,307 --> 00:11:50,274
And I got to go.
Don't go away.

00:11:50,341 --> 00:11:51,842
Guess you know how to find me
if you hear anything.

00:11:51,909 --> 00:11:52,843
Don't-Don't leave,
don't leave.

00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,712
You're one to talk.

00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:56,647
All my life,
that's all you did, walk out.

00:11:56,714 --> 00:11:58,282
Now we're gonna
Norman Rockwell it?

00:11:58,349 --> 00:11:59,717
Look around, Dad.

00:11:59,784 --> 00:12:01,485
It's too late.

00:12:01,552 --> 00:12:02,653
Don't leave.

00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,821
Leave me alone.

00:12:03,888 --> 00:12:05,056
Ellie. Ellie!

00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:12,018
Here at the clinic,
we pride ourselves

00:12:12,085 --> 00:12:13,853
a confidential relationship
with our patients.

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,989
This is a highly
unusual request.
I understand,

00:12:16,055 --> 00:12:19,083
but we're investigating
a possible homicide here.

00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:20,418
We found blood
in the trunk of a car.

00:12:20,484 --> 00:12:22,486
We have reason to believe
it could be Sasha Reynolds',

00:12:22,553 --> 00:12:23,688
street name Dakota.

00:12:23,754 --> 00:12:24,989
We're not interested

00:12:25,056 --> 00:12:26,223
in whether it's
positive or negative.

00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:28,192
We need it for the DNA.

00:12:30,461 --> 00:12:31,762
How many do you need?

00:12:31,829 --> 00:12:33,698
Ten.

00:12:34,832 --> 00:12:36,767
Twelve.

00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:47,712
Is that all
the help they get?

00:12:47,778 --> 00:12:49,380
These kids come from
all over the place

00:12:49,447 --> 00:12:50,514
with stars in their eyes.

00:12:50,581 --> 00:12:52,216
While they're waiting
to be discovered,

00:12:52,283 --> 00:12:53,451
they still got
to pay their rent.

00:12:53,517 --> 00:12:55,019
They do a bump to
turn their first trick.

00:12:55,086 --> 00:12:57,555
Next they're turning tricks
to get their next bump.

00:12:57,621 --> 00:12:59,457
We do what we can.

00:12:59,523 --> 00:13:01,125
You do what you do.
( <i>phone rings</i> )

00:13:01,192 --> 00:13:02,293
Excuse me.

00:13:04,762 --> 00:13:06,397
KRAMER ( <i>into phone</i> ):
Yeah. Kramer.

00:13:06,464 --> 00:13:07,665
Good luck.

00:13:07,732 --> 00:13:09,200
Good luck to you, too, Doctor.

00:13:09,266 --> 00:13:10,901
You're kidding me.

00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:13,804
Terrific. Okay.

00:13:13,871 --> 00:13:16,474
We're on it. Bye.

00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,976
We got an R.O. on the car.

00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,619
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:13:37,762 --> 00:13:40,631
( <i>rings doorbell</i> )

00:13:45,169 --> 00:13:47,738
Captain Kramer.
Hey, Todd.

00:13:47,805 --> 00:13:49,040
What's up?

00:13:49,106 --> 00:13:50,808
I, uh, stumbled
across something.

00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:52,576
Thought I'd pay you
a house call.

00:13:52,643 --> 00:13:54,812
You missing a car?

00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:57,181
Yeah, it was stolen.

00:13:58,182 --> 00:13:59,183
You didn't report it.

00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,352
No, I didn't.

00:14:01,419 --> 00:14:02,687
What's that about?

00:14:04,121 --> 00:14:05,589
Who are you?

00:14:05,656 --> 00:14:07,358
I'm sorry, this is
an old friend of mine,

00:14:07,425 --> 00:14:09,460
Captain Jim Brass, Vegas P.D.

00:14:16,434 --> 00:14:17,735
Off the record?

00:14:17,802 --> 00:14:19,403
Okay.

00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:21,405
I went down the hill.

00:14:21,472 --> 00:14:24,108
I was, um...

00:14:24,175 --> 00:14:26,444
...lonely.

00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:27,812
Partook of the services

00:14:27,878 --> 00:14:29,714
of a certain kind
of young lady.

00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,415
And while we were

00:14:31,482 --> 00:14:33,651
getting acquainted,
I was carjacked.

00:14:34,652 --> 00:14:35,820
( <i>tapping</i> )

00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,822
I was set up.

00:14:37,888 --> 00:14:40,891
It was probably her
pimp or drug dealer.

00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:41,892
How'd you get up the hill?

00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:43,661
Took a cab.

00:14:43,728 --> 00:14:44,795
They didn't take your wallet?

00:14:44,862 --> 00:14:46,030
The car was worth
more than the cash.

00:14:46,097 --> 00:14:47,098
They knew what
they were doing.

00:14:47,164 --> 00:14:50,201
It's a pretty sweet ride.

00:14:50,267 --> 00:14:52,603
I'm still hung up on
why you didn't report it.

00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:55,106
Captain, maybe I should
introduce myself.

00:14:55,172 --> 00:14:57,475
Todd Piccone,
Assistant City Attorney.

00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:59,410
Let's just say that
my reputation

00:14:59,477 --> 00:15:01,512
is worth more
than my car.

00:15:01,579 --> 00:15:04,682
Then maybe you should stop
having dates in your front seat.

00:15:04,749 --> 00:15:07,284
You're right.

00:15:07,351 --> 00:15:08,619
Lesson learned.

00:15:08,686 --> 00:15:10,388
Thank you, Officer.

00:15:11,489 --> 00:15:13,791
So the car was stripped,

00:15:13,858 --> 00:15:15,493
I'm sure, uh...

00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:16,694
South Central?

00:15:16,761 --> 00:15:18,763
Koreatown? East L.A.?
Koreatown.

00:15:18,829 --> 00:15:19,964
How would you know that?

00:15:20,031 --> 00:15:21,365
'Cause, Captain,
that's where good cars

00:15:21,432 --> 00:15:22,466
go to die in Los Angeles.

00:15:22,533 --> 00:15:23,901
Hey, Todd, I don't suppose

00:15:23,968 --> 00:15:25,569
we could take a look around?

00:15:26,904 --> 00:15:29,173
You know, I'm
expecting company.

00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,142
Now's not a good time.

00:15:33,711 --> 00:15:36,213
We need to get a warrant
to get into that house.

00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,682
Oh, yeah?
Well, we don't have enough.

00:15:37,748 --> 00:15:39,050
Enough for a city attorney?

00:15:39,116 --> 00:15:40,418
You know, give me a break.

00:15:40,484 --> 00:15:43,120
You know how many cars
get jacked in L.A. every day?

00:15:43,187 --> 00:15:45,656
He admitted to being
with a prostitute.

00:15:45,723 --> 00:15:46,724
What makes you think

00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:48,059
he's not telling
the truth about the rest?

00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:49,727
He's hinky. I can feel it.

00:15:49,794 --> 00:15:51,996
Your gut can talk to my judge.

00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:54,131
Or better yet,
talk to Ellie.

00:15:54,198 --> 00:15:55,199
You should.

00:15:55,266 --> 00:15:57,802
You should get the 4-1-1
on Dakota from her.

00:15:57,868 --> 00:15:59,770
There's an unreliable witness.

00:16:01,305 --> 00:16:03,975
So what do we do now?

00:16:05,343 --> 00:16:06,577
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:16:06,644 --> 00:16:07,945
We eat steak.

00:16:12,149 --> 00:16:13,284
Tony, how are
you doing?

00:16:13,351 --> 00:16:15,953
Table for two, please,
in the back, if you could.

00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,655
What are we
doing here again?

00:16:17,722 --> 00:16:19,523
I'm doing you a big favor.

00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,829
Annie, hello.
Hey, Judge Peters.

00:16:24,895 --> 00:16:26,998
What a nice surprise.
Nice to see you.

00:16:27,064 --> 00:16:28,065
Good to see you.

00:16:28,132 --> 00:16:29,233
How's that porterhouse?

00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,735
Eh, I haven't
started yet.

00:16:30,801 --> 00:16:33,704
Gentlemen, I'd like
you to meet an old
friend of mine,

00:16:33,771 --> 00:16:35,373
Captain Jim Brass, LVPD.
Hey.

00:16:35,439 --> 00:16:36,741
This is Judge Silvio Peters,

00:16:36,807 --> 00:16:38,075
Councilman Joe Cohen.

00:16:38,142 --> 00:16:40,611
Judge, Councilman.
Comptroller
Daniel Reichmann,

00:16:40,678 --> 00:16:41,846
and Vic Patterson.

00:16:41,912 --> 00:16:42,880
Hey, Vic, how are you doing?

00:16:42,947 --> 00:16:44,715
Soon to be Mayor.

00:16:44,782 --> 00:16:45,683
( <i>laughing</i> )

00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,184
Hey, you
know what?

00:16:47,251 --> 00:16:48,953
We shot a couple episodes
of my show in Vegas.

00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,588
You remember that?
Right.

00:16:50,655 --> 00:16:51,455
The Eagle.
Right.

00:16:51,522 --> 00:16:52,390
Yeah, you guys were great.

00:16:52,456 --> 00:16:54,158
You always treated us
really well.

00:16:54,225 --> 00:16:55,159
Well, we try.

00:16:55,226 --> 00:16:56,761
Remember how great
he was as that cop?

00:16:56,827 --> 00:16:57,695
( <i>laughs</i> )

00:16:57,762 --> 00:16:58,929
Like he was playing you.

00:16:58,996 --> 00:17:00,431
( <i>all laugh</i> )
Well, that's not easy.

00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:04,301
Listen, since I happened
to run into you...

00:17:04,368 --> 00:17:06,904
We found Todd Piccone's car
just off of Vermont.

00:17:06,971 --> 00:17:08,272
Had bullet holes

00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:09,674
and blood in the trunk.

00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:12,009
He claims it was stolen,
but I'm hoping

00:17:12,076 --> 00:17:14,779
that I could get a look
around his house a bit

00:17:14,845 --> 00:17:15,913
You know what?
Let me get you

00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,448
an autograph or something.

00:17:17,515 --> 00:17:18,582
Little something for me.

00:17:18,649 --> 00:17:19,984
And a little something for you.

00:17:22,787 --> 00:17:24,121
If you had enough
for a warrant,

00:17:24,188 --> 00:17:25,222
you wouldn't be here.

00:17:25,289 --> 00:17:27,525
You'd be on your cell phone,
calling me from Tommy Burger.

00:17:29,794 --> 00:17:31,729
Finish your steak
before it gets cold.

00:17:31,796 --> 00:17:33,064
There you are.

00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:34,765
I'm touched. Thank you, man.
Thank you.

00:17:34,832 --> 00:17:35,933
Gentlemen.

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,234
Enjoy your lunch,
gentlemen.

00:17:37,301 --> 00:17:38,536
Nice to see you.

00:17:41,439 --> 00:17:43,074
Strike one, your turn.

00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:52,550
( <i>TV playing loudly</i> )

00:18:01,258 --> 00:18:03,294
Oh.

00:18:03,361 --> 00:18:05,096
Well, if it isn't Dick Tracy

00:18:05,162 --> 00:18:07,365
and his little sidekick,
Nancy Drew.

00:18:07,431 --> 00:18:09,533
We're here on official business.
Just let us in.

00:18:11,135 --> 00:18:12,470
Vote Vic Patterson.

00:18:12,536 --> 00:18:15,473
Put some action
back in government.

00:18:23,714 --> 00:18:24,815
You and Dakota

00:18:24,882 --> 00:18:26,083
have the same pimp?

00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:28,219
No. We don't have a pimp.
We're independent.

00:18:28,285 --> 00:18:29,520
I can see that.

00:18:29,587 --> 00:18:32,156
Look, if she were gonna

00:18:32,223 --> 00:18:34,425
pull a con with some guy,
who would it be?

00:18:34,492 --> 00:18:36,360
She's not like that.

00:18:36,427 --> 00:18:37,795
So other than her customers,

00:18:37,862 --> 00:18:39,897
there's, what,
no men in her life?

00:18:40,931 --> 00:18:42,667
You and she are...

00:18:43,768 --> 00:18:45,736
Roommates.

00:18:45,803 --> 00:18:46,771
Look, you can be cute,

00:18:46,837 --> 00:18:48,372
or you can help us
find your friend.

00:18:48,439 --> 00:18:49,507
What's it gonna be?

00:18:49,573 --> 00:18:51,909
Well, there's this guy
named Ronnie, all right?

00:18:51,976 --> 00:18:53,811
He was kind of
like her boyfriend.

00:18:53,878 --> 00:18:56,247
Sometimes he would get jealous
when she turned tricks.

00:18:56,314 --> 00:18:58,149
Where do we find this Casanova?

00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:01,719
Look, you know
I can't go in there

00:19:01,786 --> 00:19:03,688
without probable cause
or a warrant.

00:19:03,754 --> 00:19:04,922
You're not gonna arrest me

00:19:04,989 --> 00:19:06,590
for breaking and entering,
are you?

00:19:06,657 --> 00:19:07,758
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:19:07,825 --> 00:19:09,794
Jimmy, what are you
hoping to find in there?

00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,162
I'll know it when I see it.

00:19:17,468 --> 00:19:19,337
BRASS:
Smelled something
in the hallway.

00:19:19,403 --> 00:19:21,439
That's why we
broke in, right?
Yep.

00:19:21,505 --> 00:19:25,009
KRAMER:
L.A. has over 200 criminalists.
You got to bring your own guy?

00:19:25,076 --> 00:19:26,577
BRASS:
Well, Rick is like a vampire.

00:19:26,644 --> 00:19:27,945
He needs to be invited in.

00:19:28,012 --> 00:19:29,947
If this goes to court,

00:19:30,014 --> 00:19:32,083
Warrick's going to have
to come back and testify.

00:19:32,149 --> 00:19:34,752
Well, you got beaches, bikinis.

00:19:34,819 --> 00:19:37,221
Free trip to L.A.? I'm down.

00:19:38,622 --> 00:19:40,257
So we got coffee filters,

00:19:40,324 --> 00:19:42,026
cough medicine, matches,

00:19:42,093 --> 00:19:43,728
camping fuel...

00:19:43,794 --> 00:19:45,463
hot plates.

00:19:45,529 --> 00:19:46,931
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

00:19:46,998 --> 00:19:48,265
If this is a meth lab,

00:19:48,332 --> 00:19:51,902
then there would be free iodine
coated all over these walls.

00:19:51,969 --> 00:19:55,039
And if Matt packed
this kit right,

00:19:55,106 --> 00:19:58,075
I would have some
spray starch...

00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:02,380
...that would react

00:20:02,446 --> 00:20:03,748
with the iodine.

00:20:12,256 --> 00:20:14,659
Turning it a nice Dodger blue.

00:20:16,661 --> 00:20:18,996
Yes, it's a meth lab.

00:20:41,018 --> 00:20:43,454
So meth dealer
and his hooker girlfriend

00:20:43,521 --> 00:20:45,156
looking for a quick score.

00:20:45,222 --> 00:20:46,991
Carjacking's
not such a stretch.

00:20:47,058 --> 00:20:48,159
Neighbors are lucky

00:20:48,225 --> 00:20:49,960
he didn't blow
the whole building up.

00:20:50,027 --> 00:20:51,462
BRASS:
No guns, no blood.

00:20:51,529 --> 00:20:53,130
Nothing in plain sight

00:20:53,197 --> 00:20:55,966
linking him to Dakota's
disappearance.

00:20:56,033 --> 00:20:58,469
Well, we'll haul him in
on manufacturing.

00:20:58,536 --> 00:21:00,504
We'll get what we can
out of him.

00:21:00,571 --> 00:21:02,273
Jail would be an improvement
over this hole.

00:21:04,542 --> 00:21:05,443
KRAMER:
Drop the gun!

00:21:05,509 --> 00:21:06,210
Now!

00:21:06,277 --> 00:21:07,278
BRASS:
Put the gun down.

00:21:07,345 --> 00:21:08,612
Bad guys go away.
Put the gun down.

00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:09,880
You're trying to rob <i>me?</i>

00:21:09,947 --> 00:21:10,815
Drop the gun!

00:21:10,881 --> 00:21:11,983
I'm being robbed by cops?

00:21:12,049 --> 00:21:13,217
You're trying to rob me!

00:21:13,284 --> 00:21:14,919
Don't make me

00:21:14,986 --> 00:21:16,087
shoot you.

00:21:17,788 --> 00:21:19,557
Put the gun down.

00:21:21,225 --> 00:21:22,460
Come on.

00:21:24,929 --> 00:21:27,064
( <i>sobbing</i> )

00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:37,000
How long has
the body been here?

00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:40,135
...about three
and a half hours now.

00:21:50,846 --> 00:21:52,914
OFFICER:
Jogger found her, called it in.

00:21:52,981 --> 00:21:54,616
Description matched
your broadcast.

00:21:59,721 --> 00:22:03,658
<i>Looks like body gas</i>
<i>has brought her to the top.</i>

00:22:03,725 --> 00:22:05,460
God, somebody beat
the pulp out of her.

00:22:05,527 --> 00:22:06,461
Any leads?

00:22:06,528 --> 00:22:08,730
Yeah, he's detoxing
in the tank.

00:22:08,797 --> 00:22:11,733
This is why I don't
believe in easy money.

00:22:12,934 --> 00:22:14,035
Ellie.

00:22:14,102 --> 00:22:16,071
You have to identify the body.

00:22:22,744 --> 00:22:24,479
I'm going to be sick.

00:22:24,546 --> 00:22:26,014
No, come here. Come on.

00:22:26,081 --> 00:22:27,449
Look, I just need an answer.

00:22:29,184 --> 00:22:30,252
Is this your friend?

00:22:32,788 --> 00:22:34,022
Okay.

00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:37,993
( <i>cell phone rings</i> )

00:22:44,032 --> 00:22:45,333
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,435
Brass.

00:22:46,501 --> 00:22:47,536
Family business?

00:22:47,602 --> 00:22:49,304
That is a wedding
or a funeral,

00:22:49,371 --> 00:22:50,839
or a bar mitzvah.

00:22:50,906 --> 00:22:53,308
That is not permission
to become a vice cop

00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:54,743
in another jurisdiction.

00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:55,811
Get back here now.

00:22:55,877 --> 00:22:56,878
Who you been talking to?

00:22:56,945 --> 00:22:58,046
Not that it matters.

00:22:58,113 --> 00:22:59,381
The police chief called me

00:22:59,448 --> 00:23:00,949
after Judge Peters called him.

00:23:01,016 --> 00:23:04,052
I hear they do a nice
T-bone at Musso's.

00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:05,554
Look, my kid's in trouble, Ben.

00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,322
Well, if she's not dead,

00:23:07,389 --> 00:23:08,723
you get your ass back here.

00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:11,093
Look, write me up
for insubordination.

00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:12,627
I can't come back now.

00:23:20,602 --> 00:23:23,572
KRAMER:
You have a prior.

00:23:23,638 --> 00:23:26,041
Mandatory minimum
for manufacturing--

00:23:26,108 --> 00:23:28,009
ten to 15.

00:23:28,076 --> 00:23:29,678
You start to talk
about Dakota,

00:23:29,745 --> 00:23:31,079
we'll see what we can do.

00:23:31,146 --> 00:23:32,280
Dakota?

00:23:32,347 --> 00:23:34,349
( <i>sniffing</i> )

00:23:34,416 --> 00:23:36,952
Now, what that crazy bitch
got to do with this,

00:23:37,018 --> 00:23:39,020
huh?

00:23:39,087 --> 00:23:40,856
What, she snitched on me?

00:23:40,922 --> 00:23:42,124
Not before you killed her.

00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:43,725
I didn't kill nobody.

00:23:43,792 --> 00:23:45,060
You have a relationship
with her?

00:23:45,127 --> 00:23:46,895
Yeah, we kicked it,
all right? We kicked it.

00:23:46,962 --> 00:23:49,798
Look, I would never kill no girl
with all that good...

00:23:49,865 --> 00:23:52,100
All right, look,
let's just say

00:23:52,167 --> 00:23:56,538
I enjoyed having her live
downstairs from me, man.

00:23:56,605 --> 00:23:57,939
( <i>chuckles</i> ):
Listen...

00:23:58,006 --> 00:24:02,377
She knew when to open her mouth
and when to keep it closed.

00:24:03,945 --> 00:24:06,014
Now, her girl, Jersey...

00:24:07,616 --> 00:24:10,752
Oh, God,
the best mouth I ever had.

00:24:10,819 --> 00:24:12,020
Mmm.

00:24:12,087 --> 00:24:14,589
That mouth gave me
a lot of pleasure.

00:24:14,656 --> 00:24:18,226
It just never stopped.

00:24:18,293 --> 00:24:20,061
Where were you two nights ago?

00:24:20,128 --> 00:24:21,296
Out.

00:24:21,363 --> 00:24:23,165
Be more specific!

00:24:23,231 --> 00:24:25,067
I-I-I was seeing customers,
all right?

00:24:25,133 --> 00:24:26,334
Dakota?
No.

00:24:26,401 --> 00:24:27,335
You like BMWs?

00:24:27,402 --> 00:24:28,336
Bitch, what the f...

00:24:28,403 --> 00:24:29,571
what are you talking about?!

00:24:29,638 --> 00:24:31,940
Watch your mouth!

Come on, man.
All right.

00:24:41,049 --> 00:24:43,985
So, how was he?
What do you mean?

00:24:44,052 --> 00:24:45,687
You wasn't supposed
to do him.

00:24:45,754 --> 00:24:48,323
( <i>screams</i> )

( <i>gunshots</i> )

00:24:54,262 --> 00:24:57,466
You want me to admit to a murder
I didn't commit

00:24:57,532 --> 00:24:59,735
so you can reduce a drug charge?

00:24:59,801 --> 00:25:00,936

I'm sorry you
had to hear that.

00:25:25,393 --> 00:25:26,895
What did he say?

00:25:26,962 --> 00:25:28,530
Dad?

00:25:30,265 --> 00:25:31,833
You were right; I
shouldn't have come.

00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,034
I told you
he didn't do it.

00:25:33,101 --> 00:25:34,069
It was that guy in the car.

00:25:34,136 --> 00:25:35,070
You've got to find him.

00:25:35,137 --> 00:25:36,438
Don't you understand?

00:25:36,505 --> 00:25:39,408
We just pulled your best
friend out of a lake.

00:25:39,474 --> 00:25:40,842
I mean, it was just

00:25:40,909 --> 00:25:42,511
luck it wasn't you.

00:25:42,577 --> 00:25:43,745
Yeah, well, it wasn't me.

00:25:43,812 --> 00:25:45,680
Yeah, not today.

00:25:45,747 --> 00:25:47,048
But look at you.

00:25:47,115 --> 00:25:49,484
You've turned yourself
into a disposable human being.

00:25:49,551 --> 00:25:50,919
Don't you get it?

00:25:50,986 --> 00:25:52,821
You're nothing but plumbing.

00:25:54,089 --> 00:25:57,259
What, you're going to send me
to my room and ground me?

00:25:57,325 --> 00:25:59,461
Have a patrol car
pick me up at prom?

00:25:59,528 --> 00:26:01,496
Or spank me?
Okay.

00:26:01,563 --> 00:26:02,864
You're right.

00:26:02,931 --> 00:26:04,266
You're right.

00:26:04,332 --> 00:26:06,568
I messed up.

00:26:06,635 --> 00:26:11,106
But I'm just trying to do
the best that I can.

00:26:13,475 --> 00:26:16,378
I wish you could say
the same thing.

00:26:29,891 --> 00:26:32,961
Clothes test positive
for lead wipe.

00:26:33,028 --> 00:26:34,463
Confirmed bullet hole.

00:26:34,529 --> 00:26:36,898
Did her DNA match the blood
that you swabbed from the trunk?

00:26:36,965 --> 00:26:39,935
Yeah, but the autopsy report
said she wasn't shot.

00:26:40,001 --> 00:26:41,870
So, what's
with the bullet holes?

00:26:43,472 --> 00:26:45,173
Clean-up.

00:26:56,017 --> 00:26:57,619
WARRICK:
One bullet exited.

00:26:57,686 --> 00:27:00,822
Is the other hole to the left
or to the right?

00:27:00,889 --> 00:27:03,859
About seven and a half,
eight inches up.

00:27:09,097 --> 00:27:10,866
That's the gas tank.

00:27:41,129 --> 00:27:42,431
GLAZER:
Looks like a .45.

00:27:42,497 --> 00:27:43,498
Big, fat and slow.

00:27:43,565 --> 00:27:45,267
Lucky for us,
it didn't have enough power

00:27:45,333 --> 00:27:47,769
to go through-and-through
the gas tank.

00:27:47,836 --> 00:27:49,805
Yeah. Look at that.

00:27:49,871 --> 00:27:52,174
No wonder those hood rats

00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,608
couldn't get the car started.

00:27:53,675 --> 00:27:54,709
It won't run on blood.

00:27:54,776 --> 00:27:55,811
Well, that tweaker you busted

00:27:55,877 --> 00:27:57,279
just got bumped off
the top of the list.

00:27:57,345 --> 00:27:58,280
He had a nine millimeter.

00:27:58,346 --> 00:28:00,148
You think you could run this
through IBIS?

00:28:00,215 --> 00:28:01,650
We do have that here.

00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:08,023
Hey, Doc, did you get my fax?

00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:09,157
Yeah, I did.

00:28:09,224 --> 00:28:10,892
Yeah, well,
it's all Greek to me.

00:28:10,959 --> 00:28:12,027
Can you help me out?

00:28:12,094 --> 00:28:13,361
Mmm, sure, of course.

00:28:13,428 --> 00:28:15,197
But I thought you were asked
to come home.

00:28:15,263 --> 00:28:17,666
I'll be home tomorrow.
I hope she was worth it.

00:28:17,733 --> 00:28:18,667
What do you mean?

00:28:18,734 --> 00:28:19,868
I don't know;
I mean, you put

00:28:19,935 --> 00:28:21,036
your career on the line.

00:28:21,103 --> 00:28:22,671
I assume
there's a woman involved.

00:28:22,738 --> 00:28:24,005
What are you, a detective now?

00:28:24,072 --> 00:28:27,509
All right;
let's take a look at this.

00:28:27,576 --> 00:28:29,845
FX, OC-- that's a fractured

00:28:29,911 --> 00:28:31,747
osseocartilaginous--

00:28:31,813 --> 00:28:33,148
<i>that's a broken nose.</i>

00:28:33,215 --> 00:28:37,385
<i>FX, ST, CL-- sternal clavicle,</i>

00:28:37,452 --> 00:28:39,788
and LAC, SDH on her head--

00:28:39,855 --> 00:28:42,991
lacerations
and subdural hematomas.

00:28:43,058 --> 00:28:43,859
Cause of death?

00:28:43,925 --> 00:28:45,260
It looks like exsanguination.

00:28:45,327 --> 00:28:46,261
So, she was beaten

00:28:46,328 --> 00:28:47,529
and left to die?

00:28:47,596 --> 00:28:49,831
Beaten with something specific.

00:28:49,898 --> 00:28:51,433
The L.A. coroner noted

00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:55,270
<i>repetitive</i>
<i>patterned contusions.</i>

00:28:55,337 --> 00:28:56,938
Anything else?

00:28:57,005 --> 00:28:59,608
Yeah, the coroner's assistant

00:28:59,674 --> 00:29:00,909
who prepped her body

00:29:00,976 --> 00:29:02,277
<i>collected a green, waxy</i>
<i>substance</i>

00:29:02,344 --> 00:29:04,446
<i>under her fingernails.</i>

00:29:04,513 --> 00:29:08,717
Also, looks like he found
concrete chunks

00:29:08,784 --> 00:29:09,985
in a bag tied to her waist.

00:29:10,051 --> 00:29:11,386
Probably what they used

00:29:11,453 --> 00:29:13,722
to weigh her down in the lake.

00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:20,162
You want to say
I told you so?

00:29:20,228 --> 00:29:23,565
No. I just want it
to be over with

00:29:23,632 --> 00:29:26,034
and have a happy ending.

00:29:30,572 --> 00:29:31,873
PICCONE:
What the hell's going on?

00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:32,908
What's up?
Sorry, Todd.

00:29:32,974 --> 00:29:34,409
We got the warrant;
we have to search.

00:29:34,476 --> 00:29:35,410
You got to be
kidding me.

00:29:35,477 --> 00:29:37,646
Wha...?

00:29:37,712 --> 00:29:40,015
I just had the
floors polished.

00:29:40,082 --> 00:29:42,651
Will you at least
take your shoes off, please?

00:29:42,717 --> 00:29:44,886
I sleep in my shoes, Todd.

00:29:51,726 --> 00:29:52,894
This guy married?

00:29:52,961 --> 00:29:53,962
No.

00:29:54,029 --> 00:29:55,163
Mm-hmm.

00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:57,899
Anyone else's gaydar
going off?

00:29:57,966 --> 00:30:00,602
Well, he did have
a female hooker in his ride.

00:30:00,669 --> 00:30:02,471
Well, maybe he swings both ways.

00:30:02,537 --> 00:30:06,174
Why, because he has
this nice shag carpet?

00:30:09,244 --> 00:30:11,246
This carpet's wet.

00:30:22,924 --> 00:30:24,693
Oh, yeah.

00:30:26,862 --> 00:30:28,830
That's a lot of blood.

00:30:28,897 --> 00:30:29,965
How much, you figure?

00:30:30,031 --> 00:30:32,100
I don't know--
two, three pints?

00:30:32,167 --> 00:30:34,336
Nobody loses that much blood
and lives.

00:30:34,403 --> 00:30:35,570
She died in this room.

00:30:35,637 --> 00:30:37,005
I don't think
we'll be able to get

00:30:37,072 --> 00:30:38,106
any DNA off this.

00:30:38,173 --> 00:30:39,975
The carpet solvents

00:30:40,041 --> 00:30:42,010
probably compromised the sample.

00:30:42,077 --> 00:30:43,612
She was beaten multiple times.

00:30:43,678 --> 00:30:45,781
There must be
some spatter or cast-off.

00:30:59,094 --> 00:31:00,629
I can't get a clean read.

00:31:03,365 --> 00:31:04,299
You know what?

00:31:04,366 --> 00:31:06,001
It's this metal surface.

00:31:06,068 --> 00:31:08,403
It's giving us a false positive.

00:31:12,641 --> 00:31:14,409
Does anyone see a remote?

00:31:16,211 --> 00:31:17,512
Yeah, got one
right here.

00:31:17,579 --> 00:31:20,382
Could you hit the input button
until we find a blue screen?

00:31:20,449 --> 00:31:21,783
Yeah.

00:31:24,252 --> 00:31:25,954
Look at that.

00:31:27,155 --> 00:31:28,957
MATT:
I'll get a sample
for DNA.

00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,195
Nice place.

00:31:33,261 --> 00:31:34,729
BRASS:
Mmm.

00:31:39,134 --> 00:31:41,703
Who needs
three trash bins?

00:31:43,338 --> 00:31:45,774
Someone with a lot of dirt.

00:31:46,908 --> 00:31:48,410
Wow.

00:31:48,477 --> 00:31:49,611
Big party.

00:31:49,678 --> 00:31:50,979
Tequila.

00:31:52,681 --> 00:31:54,082
Whiskey.

00:31:54,149 --> 00:31:56,451
Gin.

00:31:58,787 --> 00:32:00,355
Absinthe.

00:32:00,422 --> 00:32:01,790
BRASS:
The coroner
found green wax

00:32:01,857 --> 00:32:04,292
under Dakota's fingernails.

00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:12,033
( <i>sighing</i> ):
Yes, I solicited her.

00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,636
So, you admit
to having sexual relations

00:32:14,703 --> 00:32:16,705
with Sasha Reynolds,
a.k.a. Dakota?

00:32:16,772 --> 00:32:18,273
PICCONE:
No.

00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:21,176
But money changed hands?

00:32:21,243 --> 00:32:22,778
I paid her $60.

00:32:22,844 --> 00:32:24,479
For what?

00:32:24,546 --> 00:32:27,983
I drove her back to my house
and introduced her to a friend.

00:32:28,049 --> 00:32:29,651
And then?

00:32:31,653 --> 00:32:34,356
I have no knowledge
of what happened after that.

00:32:39,194 --> 00:32:42,330
Does this friend have a name?

00:32:42,397 --> 00:32:45,567
Mmm. A big one.

00:32:47,602 --> 00:32:50,372
You know, Todd, I think
you're smart enough

00:32:50,439 --> 00:32:52,741
to recognize
consciousness of guilt.

00:32:52,808 --> 00:32:55,177
Blood in your house,

00:32:55,243 --> 00:32:58,080
in your car.

00:32:58,146 --> 00:33:00,682
All of which
was cleaned up.

00:33:00,749 --> 00:33:03,552
This friend
worth going to prison for?

00:33:05,987 --> 00:33:07,722
Turn off that mic.

00:33:23,638 --> 00:33:26,708
( <i>no audio</i> )

00:33:35,717 --> 00:33:37,285
Officer.

00:33:51,266 --> 00:33:53,268
He invoked.

00:34:06,245 --> 00:34:07,346
( <i>brakes squealing</i> )

00:34:07,413 --> 00:34:09,081
BRASS:
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:34:09,148 --> 00:34:10,583
I wanted to catch you
before you left.

00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:11,917
I got a look
at the print results

00:34:11,984 --> 00:34:14,053
from the bottles
that we collected just before

00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:15,888
I was escorted out
and asked to leave the lab.

00:34:15,955 --> 00:34:16,889
They say why?

00:34:16,956 --> 00:34:18,157
No, but I think I know why.

00:34:18,958 --> 00:34:21,293
It's like Chinatown, Jim.

00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:24,330
So visiting hours
are over, Doctor.

00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:25,531
It's time to go.

00:34:25,598 --> 00:34:26,532
What about Ellie?

00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:27,766
What about her?

00:34:27,833 --> 00:34:28,867
Well, she's the only one

00:34:28,934 --> 00:34:30,736
who can I.D.
Todd Piccone as the driver.

00:34:30,803 --> 00:34:32,905
Well, I couldn't get much
out of Annie, but I don't think

00:34:32,972 --> 00:34:34,607
Piccone killed Dakota--
it wasn't his scene.

00:34:34,673 --> 00:34:35,908
I don't know. He's involved.

00:34:35,975 --> 00:34:38,010
It's his house.
It's his car. It's his party.

00:34:38,077 --> 00:34:40,346
Who's going to believe
a tweaker hooker?

00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:42,548
You better hope nobody, or
she'll be taking a dirt nap.

00:34:42,615 --> 00:34:44,950
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

00:34:45,017 --> 00:34:47,620
( <i>on answering machine</i> ):
Hey, it's Ellie. Leave a message

00:34:47,686 --> 00:34:50,155
and I'll get back
at you when I can.

00:34:50,222 --> 00:34:51,757
BRASS:
Yeah, uh, Ellie,

00:34:51,824 --> 00:34:53,192
it's, it's your dad.

00:34:53,259 --> 00:34:55,761
Listen, you were right
about the guy

00:34:55,828 --> 00:35:00,633
He's a pretty important person
with pretty important friends.

00:35:00,699 --> 00:35:02,635
So, uh, do me a favor.

00:35:02,701 --> 00:35:05,638
Don't go out tonight.

00:35:05,704 --> 00:35:07,406
Okay?

00:35:07,473 --> 00:35:08,707
( <i>tape beeps off</i> )

00:35:13,178 --> 00:35:15,948
If Dakota had wax
under her fingernails,

00:35:16,015 --> 00:35:19,418
I think she must have been doing
more than just pouring.

00:35:19,485 --> 00:35:20,419
Self defense?

00:35:20,486 --> 00:35:25,824
( <i>screaming</i> )

00:35:25,891 --> 00:35:28,327
Who was she defending against?

00:35:28,394 --> 00:35:29,995
From the prints
that we got off the bottle,

00:35:30,062 --> 00:35:31,330
I have a list of six suspects.

00:35:31,397 --> 00:35:33,399
Silvio Peters, Joe Cohen...

00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:35,167
Wait a minute.
Silvio Peters?

00:35:35,234 --> 00:35:36,802
He's a judge.

00:35:36,869 --> 00:35:38,003
He's on the list?

00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,004
Yeah.

00:35:39,071 --> 00:35:40,005
Daniel Reichmann,

00:35:40,072 --> 00:35:41,106
Vic Patterson,

00:35:41,173 --> 00:35:42,408
Todd Piccone,

00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:43,676
Parker Smythe.

00:35:43,742 --> 00:35:44,843
They're all in AFIS?

00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:47,413
Yeah. I mean, you can be
in AFIS for a lot of reasons.

00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:49,982
After 9-11, anyone who works
in a government building.

00:35:50,049 --> 00:35:52,251
Right. I mean, doctors,
lawyers, right.

00:35:52,318 --> 00:35:54,753
Or anyone who has a permit
to carry a concealed weapon.

00:35:55,554 --> 00:35:56,822
You know what?

00:35:59,525 --> 00:36:01,360
( <i>dial tone</i> )

00:36:05,564 --> 00:36:07,766
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:08,834
Hello!

00:36:08,901 --> 00:36:09,969
Hey, Nicky.

00:36:10,035 --> 00:36:11,670
Where are you?
Are you near a computer?

00:36:11,737 --> 00:36:12,705
Can you do me a favor?

00:36:12,771 --> 00:36:14,340
Yeah, sure.
How's the conference going?

00:36:14,406 --> 00:36:16,108
Uh, it's intense.

00:36:16,175 --> 00:36:18,510
I have a list
of suspects, all in AFIS.

00:36:18,577 --> 00:36:19,979
I want to know if any of them

00:36:20,045 --> 00:36:21,647
have a permit
to carry concealed.

00:36:21,714 --> 00:36:22,815
Okay, shoot.

00:36:22,881 --> 00:36:24,683
Silvio Peters, Joe Cohen,

00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:26,652
Daniel Reichmann, Vic Patterson.

00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:27,686
Mm-hmm.

00:36:27,753 --> 00:36:28,988
Todd Piccone,

00:36:29,054 --> 00:36:30,055
Parker Smythe.

00:36:33,392 --> 00:36:35,561
Vic Patterson does.

00:36:35,628 --> 00:36:37,196
Are we talking
about "The Eagle"?

00:36:37,263 --> 00:36:38,497
From that TV show?

00:36:38,564 --> 00:36:40,799
Yeah. What kind of gun?

00:36:40,866 --> 00:36:44,336
A .45, same kind he uses in
all his cheeseball shoot-outs.

00:36:44,403 --> 00:36:46,505
Can you give me anything else?

00:36:46,572 --> 00:36:48,207
Yeah, I can run
the serial number

00:36:48,274 --> 00:36:50,409
through Automated
Firearms Service,

00:36:50,476 --> 00:36:52,745
give you the history.

00:36:52,811 --> 00:36:54,747
Colt sold it
to the Beverly Hills Gun Club,

00:36:54,813 --> 00:36:58,150
who, in turn,
sold it to "The Eagle"

00:36:58,217 --> 00:37:00,352
on September 28, 1983.

00:37:03,756 --> 00:37:07,993
If he shops there,
maybe he shoots there.

00:37:09,128 --> 00:37:10,663
BRASS:
<i>You know, I'm just</i>

00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:12,598
<i>in town for a couple of days.</i>

00:37:12,665 --> 00:37:14,133
It's always been a dream of mine

00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:16,302
to shoot at the famous
Beverly Hills Gun Club.

00:37:16,368 --> 00:37:18,504
I wonder if I
could get a day pass?

00:37:18,571 --> 00:37:19,505
For Las Vegas's finest?

00:37:19,572 --> 00:37:20,906
Sure thing.

00:37:20,973 --> 00:37:22,841
Look, um...
Tell me something.

00:37:22,908 --> 00:37:25,511
You know, is it,
is it true that, uh,

00:37:25,578 --> 00:37:28,781
you know, the actor, Vic
Patterson, shoots here?

00:37:28,847 --> 00:37:31,283
Not really supposed to
give out member info.

00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:32,651
But between you and me?

00:37:32,718 --> 00:37:34,320
The man is a damn fine shot.

00:37:34,386 --> 00:37:35,521
No kidding.
Matter of fact,

00:37:35,588 --> 00:37:37,957
he won several of
our competitions.
Wow.

00:37:38,023 --> 00:37:39,792
You want to rent
or shoot your own?

00:37:39,858 --> 00:37:40,926
Um...

00:37:40,993 --> 00:37:42,861
I'll shoot what Vic shoots.

00:37:47,933 --> 00:37:48,867
You shooting, too?

00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:51,337
Nah, I'm just
going to hang back.

00:37:51,403 --> 00:37:53,339
Let him blow off some steam.

00:37:55,341 --> 00:37:56,408
Ain't that something?

00:37:56,475 --> 00:37:58,077
Yeah, it's something.

00:37:58,143 --> 00:37:59,745
Right this way.

00:38:09,021 --> 00:38:11,390
Hey, Jim.
I just got your bullet.

00:38:11,457 --> 00:38:14,093
I'm running it
through IBIS right now.

00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:15,995
Not gonna ask how <i>you</i> got it.

00:38:23,369 --> 00:38:24,637
So, did you meet him?

00:38:24,703 --> 00:38:25,638
Yeah.

00:38:25,704 --> 00:38:26,672
Ha-ha. Yeah.

00:38:26,739 --> 00:38:28,741
Did you get
his autograph for me?

00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:31,010
You know, actually I did,
and if you get me a match,

00:38:31,076 --> 00:38:32,912
you might be able
to meet him at his trial.

00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:36,482
Do you think that would make his
autograph worth more? Or less?

00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:39,451
We got a match.

00:38:39,518 --> 00:38:42,321
Entered by Matt Glazer, LAPD.

00:38:42,388 --> 00:38:44,823
Recovered from a BMW gas tank.

00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:47,826
Open investigation,
homicide-related.

00:38:47,893 --> 00:38:49,261
Great, great.

00:38:49,328 --> 00:38:50,996
Thanks for all
your help. Thank you.

00:38:51,063 --> 00:38:52,231
Sure.

00:38:54,433 --> 00:38:56,468
Was that Nick?

00:38:56,535 --> 00:38:57,970
Yeah. IBIS
confirmed the match.

00:38:58,037 --> 00:38:59,138
We're good to go.

00:38:59,204 --> 00:39:00,472
So, where you been?

00:39:00,539 --> 00:39:02,007
In Hollywood,
thinking.

00:39:02,074 --> 00:39:03,576
You know, even if Vic Patterson

00:39:03,642 --> 00:39:05,311
did shoot up the car
with his gun,

00:39:05,377 --> 00:39:07,046
that doesn't mean
he killed Dakota.

00:39:07,112 --> 00:39:08,614
Just means he helped clean up.

00:39:08,681 --> 00:39:10,683
She wasn't shot. She was beaten.

00:39:10,749 --> 00:39:13,018
Yeah. We need a murder
weapon to nail his ass.

00:39:13,085 --> 00:39:14,420
I got these photos
at a Hollywood

00:39:14,486 --> 00:39:18,290
memorabilia shop for ten bucks.

00:39:18,357 --> 00:39:20,626
Who do you see?

00:39:21,694 --> 00:39:22,861
A jackass.

00:39:22,928 --> 00:39:24,630
Look closer.

00:39:24,697 --> 00:39:27,299
Look at the pistol grip...
and The Eagle.

00:39:27,366 --> 00:39:30,869
You know,
these autopsy photos I saw

00:39:30,936 --> 00:39:31,971
all got me thinking.

00:39:32,037 --> 00:39:35,741
This one. Look at
the pattern contusions.

00:39:40,746 --> 00:39:43,249
The <i>gun</i> is the murder weapon.

00:39:43,315 --> 00:39:46,118
( <i>shrieking</i> )
Stop it! Stop it!

00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,796
About six months ago,
this strung-out hooker

00:39:57,863 --> 00:40:00,399
comes into the PD,
beat to crap,

00:40:00,466 --> 00:40:02,935
screaming that Vic
Patterson had done it,

00:40:03,002 --> 00:40:05,371
and her wounds looked
a lot like this.

00:40:07,172 --> 00:40:08,741
I figured it
was her pimp,

00:40:08,807 --> 00:40:10,843
she was sniffing around
for a settlement.

00:40:12,878 --> 00:40:15,047
Sent her home
with an ice pack.

00:40:15,114 --> 00:40:16,315
I'm sorry.

00:40:16,382 --> 00:40:19,018
I knew you thought
this guy was a winner.

00:40:19,752 --> 00:40:21,020
I worked my whole life

00:40:21,086 --> 00:40:24,690
to sit at the table
with the big boys...

00:40:24,757 --> 00:40:26,692
only to find out
that the food is poisoned.

00:40:28,027 --> 00:40:30,696
You know, the only record
of this investigation

00:40:30,763 --> 00:40:33,699
is in that envelope,
and half the evidence collection

00:40:33,766 --> 00:40:36,335
won't stand up in court,
so it's your call.

00:40:38,637 --> 00:40:39,738
How many years

00:40:39,805 --> 00:40:40,906
you got on?

00:40:40,973 --> 00:40:42,308
Eight back
in Jersey,

00:40:42,374 --> 00:40:43,509
15 here.

00:40:43,576 --> 00:40:44,743
Well, that's

00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:46,812
23 combined.
That's a lot of innings.

00:40:48,213 --> 00:40:51,116
I mean, the worse they can do
is make you retire.

00:40:51,183 --> 00:40:55,321
What am I gonna do then? Knit?

00:40:55,387 --> 00:40:58,457
This is it, Jimmy.
This is all I got.

00:40:58,524 --> 00:41:02,394
Well, if it's all you got,
then you got to do it right.

00:41:06,065 --> 00:41:07,299
Remember
Mike O'Toole?

00:41:07,366 --> 00:41:09,235
From Vice?

00:41:09,301 --> 00:41:10,736
Of course I do.

00:41:12,404 --> 00:41:15,574
Broke my heart when I
found out he was dirty.

00:41:15,641 --> 00:41:17,676
Yeah, he was a heartbreaker.

00:41:17,743 --> 00:41:19,345
Broke up my marriage.

00:41:21,747 --> 00:41:23,816
I thought I did that.

00:41:23,882 --> 00:41:25,651
Well, Nancy used our affair

00:41:25,718 --> 00:41:28,220
because she was
looking for a way out,

00:41:28,287 --> 00:41:30,689
but for me...

00:41:30,756 --> 00:41:33,025
I mean,
I guess I'm old-fashioned.

00:41:33,092 --> 00:41:35,828
You know, a bad marriage
is better than no marriage...

00:41:35,895 --> 00:41:36,996
I thought.

00:41:37,062 --> 00:41:38,998
And you thought
a kid would help?

00:41:39,064 --> 00:41:40,299
You see, that's the thing.

00:41:45,437 --> 00:41:47,072
I didn't have a kid.

00:41:53,312 --> 00:41:55,281
Yeah, you did.

00:41:56,949 --> 00:41:59,652
I don't see Mike O'Toole
out here helping her.

00:41:59,718 --> 00:42:01,053
Well...

00:42:02,554 --> 00:42:03,889
I spent a good chunk

00:42:03,956 --> 00:42:06,325
of my life
looking the other way.

00:42:06,392 --> 00:42:09,962
I mean, so much so
that my neck got tired.

00:42:10,029 --> 00:42:11,931
So I, you know, I got a divorce.

00:42:11,997 --> 00:42:15,301
I, uh... turned Mike
and his crew in.

00:42:15,367 --> 00:42:18,871
Started over in Vegas.

00:42:18,938 --> 00:42:20,072
Ellie.

00:42:22,942 --> 00:42:27,746
She's like the unfinished
business of all that.

00:42:32,418 --> 00:42:34,286
So it's <i>my</i> neck now.
