Vanessa Keaton.

00:01:50,296 --> 00:01:52,265
She lived over there.

00:01:52,332 --> 00:01:55,301
A neighbor walking her dog
found her.

00:01:59,038 --> 00:02:01,341
This is a pretty well-dressed
crowd for this time of night.

00:02:01,407 --> 00:02:02,909
Well, you know,
it's a shindig.

00:02:06,379 --> 00:02:10,283
Left the party early.

00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:12,785
That's Dan Keaton,
and that's his daughter Amy.

00:02:12,852 --> 00:02:14,520
You know,
you might want

00:02:14,587 --> 00:02:16,489

they're all suspects,
aren't they?

00:02:30,403 --> 00:02:33,272
Foam in her nose
and mouth.

00:02:33,339 --> 00:02:34,941
It's consistent with drowning.

00:02:35,008 --> 00:02:37,477
Abrasion on her forehead
is fresh.

00:02:39,979 --> 00:02:43,449
And lividity is unfixed.

00:02:43,516 --> 00:02:46,352
Well, since water motion
has no effect...

For what?

00:03:54,714 --> 00:03:57,183
Partying.

00:03:58,685 --> 00:04:00,987
What time did you leave?

00:04:01,054 --> 00:04:04,223
Around 11:00, I think.

00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:05,224
Anyone see you come home?

00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:06,793
Maybe your daughter?
This is Amy, right?

00:04:06,859 --> 00:04:07,894
AMY:
I went out
with friends.

00:04:07,961 --> 00:04:10,463
My curfew's 1:00.
I was a little late.

00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:13,333
So, Amy, did you see
your parents when you came in?

00:04:13,399 --> 00:04:15,435
My mom was in Detroit.

00:04:15,501 --> 00:04:17,036
Vanessa's my stepmom.

00:04:18,571 --> 00:04:20,173
The TV was on in their room.

00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:22,375
I snuck into my room
and went to bed.

00:04:22,442 --> 00:04:24,644
The sirens woke me up.

00:04:25,678 --> 00:04:27,513
The sirens, huh?

00:04:28,681 --> 00:04:29,949
SIDLE:
You know, they never go home

00:04:30,016 --> 00:04:31,751
until they see
the body taken away?

00:04:31,818 --> 00:04:33,052
Necrophilic voyeurism.

00:04:41,127 --> 00:04:42,161
Hot shoes.

00:04:42,228 --> 00:04:43,696
You think these are sexy, huh?

00:04:43,763 --> 00:04:44,964
Did you know

00:04:45,031 --> 00:04:46,733
that shoes like these
put degenerative stress

00:04:46,799 --> 00:04:48,801
on the hip joints, throw off
the curve of the spine,

00:04:48,868 --> 00:04:51,904
and the tilt to the pelvis,
over time,

00:04:51,971 --> 00:04:53,006
women get headaches,

00:04:53,072 --> 00:04:54,907
sore backs,
shortened calf muscles

00:04:54,974 --> 00:04:56,709
and bunions, of course.

00:04:56,776 --> 00:04:58,945
I take it back.

00:04:59,012 --> 00:05:00,680
First thoughts?

00:05:00,747 --> 00:05:02,548
Vanessa Keaton
was walking home.

00:05:02,615 --> 00:05:05,385
She had a few.
Her feet hurt.

00:05:05,451 --> 00:05:06,552
She takes off her shoes.

00:05:06,619 --> 00:05:09,122

Nothing to suggest contact.

00:05:17,196 --> 00:05:18,831
The fountain was on.

00:05:18,898 --> 00:05:21,367
Maybe the action of the water
washed away evidence.

00:05:21,434 --> 00:05:23,369
How do we know
it was an accident?

00:05:23,436 --> 00:05:24,837
Maybe she wasn't alone.

00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:27,640
We don't know that.

00:05:27,707 --> 00:05:29,008
We're going to need
a water sample

00:05:29,075 --> 00:05:30,410
and a bag for the shoe,
of course.

00:05:30,476 --> 00:05:32,011
Okay.

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,588

After a triple and three
back-to-back scenes,

00:05:45,058 --> 00:05:46,492
I'm tired.

00:05:46,559 --> 00:05:47,660
I'm going to take
a ten in the car

00:05:47,727 --> 00:05:48,928
before we head back.

00:05:48,995 --> 00:05:51,397
That's better than bouncing
off the curb, I guess.

00:05:51,464 --> 00:05:52,398
Yeah.

00:05:52,465 --> 00:05:56,235
Okay, you ready
to run it?

00:05:56,302 --> 00:05:58,037
Sure.

00:05:58,104 --> 00:06:00,740
Landlord's working late,

00:06:00,807 --> 00:06:01,607
trying to fix
up the place

00:06:01,674 --> 00:06:02,742
for the new tenant,
kicking up dust,

00:06:02,809 --> 00:06:04,377
paint fumes.

00:06:04,444 --> 00:06:06,012
Door's open
for ventilation.

00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,213
Killer strolls in.

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,581
Next thing you know,

00:06:08,648 --> 00:06:10,717
landlord's deli meat.

00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,021
( <i>gasps</i> )

00:06:16,255 --> 00:06:18,625
Well, we have
this eviction notice.

00:06:18,691 --> 00:06:20,126
So, that means no business.

00:06:20,193 --> 00:06:21,527
No business, no cash,

00:06:21,594 --> 00:06:24,397
so that could rule out
robbery as a motive.

00:06:24,464 --> 00:06:27,100
I'm having Detective Cavalier
run down the evicted tenants.

00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:31,571
It's a Melissa Pooley
and a Charlie Pincher.

00:06:31,638 --> 00:06:32,939
Sorry, can't let you in.

00:06:34,674 --> 00:06:36,709
Hey, you guys call
yourselves investigators?

00:06:36,776 --> 00:06:38,111
You've been here four hours.

00:06:38,177 --> 00:06:39,445
You haven't figured
this out yet?

00:06:39,512 --> 00:06:40,747
Crime scene cleanup.

00:06:40,813 --> 00:06:42,482
Blood bucket brigade.

00:06:42,548 --> 00:06:45,151
Hey, I prefer bio-
recovery services.

00:06:45,218 --> 00:06:46,286
You know, it's funny.

00:06:46,352 --> 00:06:48,554
I don't see an American
Bio-Recovery badge.

00:06:48,621 --> 00:06:51,791
See, all you really need
is a strong stomach,

00:06:51,858 --> 00:06:53,793
a thorough knowledge
of solvents,

00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,695
a little sensitivity,
a little tact.

00:06:55,762 --> 00:06:56,863
Whoa.

00:06:56,929 --> 00:06:59,666
Man!

00:06:59,732 --> 00:07:02,535
There must be three quarts
of blood in there.

00:07:02,602 --> 00:07:04,103
Hey, you're using anhydron.

00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:06,139
I charge extra for that.

00:07:06,205 --> 00:07:08,141

00:07:12,011 --> 00:07:13,680
Did you finish the sketch?

00:07:13,746 --> 00:07:14,681
Yeah.

00:07:14,747 --> 00:07:15,682
Great.

00:07:15,748 --> 00:07:18,818
Hey, you guys have done
everything but leave.

00:07:18,885 --> 00:07:20,520
What's the rush, Marty?

00:07:20,586 --> 00:07:22,121
The wife of the deceased,

00:07:22,188 --> 00:07:25,692
she would like this mess
cleaned up as soon as possible.

00:07:25,758 --> 00:07:27,293
New tenant moves in
on the first.

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,928
Okay, Marty.

00:07:28,995 --> 00:07:30,763
I'll have the detective
release the scene.

00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:34,567
Well, I'll get my gear.

00:07:36,536 --> 00:07:40,840
One of the most attractive women
I've had on my table.

00:07:40,907 --> 00:07:42,542
But beauty's skin deep

00:07:42,608 --> 00:07:45,912
and inside, we all look
pretty much the same.

00:07:45,979 --> 00:07:48,748
What about this abrasion?

00:07:48,815 --> 00:07:50,817
Have you no poet in you?

00:07:50,883 --> 00:07:51,985
Beauty is truth,
truth, beauty.

00:07:52,051 --> 00:07:53,119
That is all you know
on Earth

00:07:53,186 --> 00:07:55,188
and all you need to know--
except cause of death.

00:07:55,254 --> 00:07:57,824
Pulmonary edema
due to drowning.

00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:00,927
I sent samples of the water
in her lungs to Trace.

00:08:00,994 --> 00:08:02,128
The abrasion's
serious enough

00:08:02,195 --> 00:08:03,463
to cause loss
of consciousness.

00:08:03,529 --> 00:08:04,797
You may want to
look at this though.

00:08:04,864 --> 00:08:06,566
You want to come over here?

00:08:06,633 --> 00:08:08,134
Let's turn her over.

00:08:16,409 --> 00:08:17,710
Puncture wounds?

00:08:17,777 --> 00:08:21,614
Four, uniform diameter,
perimortem, non-lethal.

00:08:21,681 --> 00:08:23,816
No corresponding holes
in her dress.

00:08:23,883 --> 00:08:26,719
So she wasn't wearing it
when she was stabbed.

00:08:26,786 --> 00:08:28,788
Collected lubricant
from the labia.

00:08:28,855 --> 00:08:30,123
Which means, uh...

00:08:30,189 --> 00:08:34,260
I don't know if she had a date
with her husband or herself.

00:08:34,327 --> 00:08:36,729
I sent an SAE kit to DNA.

00:08:36,796 --> 00:08:39,032
Personal observation--

00:08:39,098 --> 00:08:40,933
you don't wear

00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,703
La Perla to a
Tupperware party.

00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:45,938
La Perla?

00:08:46,005 --> 00:08:47,674
Very expensive.

00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,409
I gave some to my wife once.

00:08:49,475 --> 00:08:51,577
She accused me
of having an affair.

00:08:51,644 --> 00:08:53,780
You know, sex on the steel.

00:08:55,682 --> 00:08:57,583
Lubricant and lingerie.

00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:00,253
I don't think the evening
turned out the way she planned,

00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,688
do you?

00:09:01,754 --> 00:09:03,356
Nope.

00:09:05,417 --> 00:09:07,953
So your business goes bust
and Mr. Visingi evicts you.

00:09:08,019 --> 00:09:10,622
Pac-Man, Pong,
loved these games.

00:09:10,689 --> 00:09:12,023
Thought it was
a sure thing.

00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:13,458
Well, today, it's all
3-D interactive.

00:09:13,525 --> 00:09:14,559
You know, I got kids.

00:09:14,626 --> 00:09:16,628
You want some advice?
No.

00:09:16,695 --> 00:09:18,363
Never go into business with
somebody you're sleeping with.

00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:20,365
Melissa Pooley?
Bitch.

00:09:20,432 --> 00:09:21,833
We haven't been able

00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:22,934
to find her.

00:09:23,001 --> 00:09:24,669
You know where she is?

00:09:24,736 --> 00:09:26,571
We broke up.
At least I think we broke up.

00:09:26,638 --> 00:09:27,772
She skipped town

00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,274
without telling me,
stuck me with the rent.

00:09:29,341 --> 00:09:31,142
So you were angry

00:09:31,209 --> 00:09:32,444
at her, you were
angry at him.

00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:33,712
I didn't kill him.

00:09:33,778 --> 00:09:34,713
He was holding

00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:36,081
your inventory hostage.

00:09:36,147 --> 00:09:38,650
How much you got tied up in
Centipede and Space Invaders?

00:09:38,717 --> 00:09:40,085
Every penny I got.

00:09:40,151 --> 00:09:41,686
About 20K.

00:09:41,753 --> 00:09:43,655
You must have
wanted it back.

00:09:43,722 --> 00:09:47,659
Hey, did you stop by
the store last night?

00:09:47,726 --> 00:09:50,629
No, but I called him.

00:09:50,695 --> 00:09:52,797
Asked if we could
maybe work something out.

00:09:52,864 --> 00:09:55,400
Told me to go screw myself,
he'd see me in court.

00:09:55,467 --> 00:09:57,502
Mr. Pincher, I'm going
to need to go ahead

00:09:57,569 --> 00:09:58,603
and get your fingerprints.

00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:00,972
( <i>groans</i> )

00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:03,441
You're going to find my prints
all over that place.

00:10:03,508 --> 00:10:05,477
It was my store,
mine and Melissa's.

00:10:05,543 --> 00:10:08,313
I expect to find your prints
in certain places, sir.

00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,415
We're just doing this
to rule you out.

00:10:10,482 --> 00:10:13,218
Oh.

00:10:21,893 --> 00:10:24,429
You alternate hands
when you double glove?

00:10:24,496 --> 00:10:25,530
Yes.

00:10:25,597 --> 00:10:27,532
And I don't like
being watched.

00:10:27,599 --> 00:10:29,501
If you alternate,
there's more contact

00:10:29,567 --> 00:10:32,437
between the exposed latex
of the first glove

00:10:32,504 --> 00:10:34,205
and atmospheric microbes.

00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,108
What?

00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:40,345
You know,
it would have been better

00:10:40,412 --> 00:10:42,547
if you didn't say anything,
but you did

00:10:42,614 --> 00:10:44,950
making it impossible
for me to concentrate,

00:10:45,016 --> 00:10:46,718
and now I have
to sanitize

00:10:46,785 --> 00:10:48,820
and start over.

00:10:48,887 --> 00:10:51,056
Hey, Hodges, you got
the results

00:10:51,122 --> 00:10:52,357
of our drowning
victim?

00:10:52,424 --> 00:10:53,525
Yeah, in five.

00:10:53,592 --> 00:10:55,894
I'm in the middle
of the rest of my life.

00:10:55,961 --> 00:10:57,662
Well, I kind of need them now.

00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:02,000
I'll be back.

00:11:03,969 --> 00:11:05,537
Good thing you didn't
have to take

00:11:05,604 --> 00:11:07,138
a spelling test
to work the field.

00:11:07,205 --> 00:11:08,273
"Funtain" water?

00:11:09,975 --> 00:11:11,409
My people are Norwegian.

00:11:11,476 --> 00:11:12,744
That's how we spell it.

00:11:14,446 --> 00:11:16,081
So, is the "funtain"
water in her lungs?

00:11:16,147 --> 00:11:18,850
All bodies of water contain
unicellular algae.

00:11:18,917 --> 00:11:20,151
Called diatoms.

00:11:20,218 --> 00:11:21,152
They're unique,
like fingerprints.

00:11:21,219 --> 00:11:22,621
Diatoms from one
body of water

00:11:22,687 --> 00:11:24,089
don't match those
from any other.

00:11:24,155 --> 00:11:25,657
Well, you're roughly right.

00:11:25,724 --> 00:11:27,092
Here, take a look.

00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,862
The diatoms on the left

00:11:30,929 --> 00:11:32,797
are from the water
found in your victim's lungs

00:11:32,864 --> 00:11:34,733
and the diatoms on the right are
from the fountain.

00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:35,734
Not a match.

00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,369
Not even close.

00:11:37,435 --> 00:11:39,571
Which means
she didn't drown there.

00:11:39,638 --> 00:11:41,539
I'll throw you a bone.

00:11:41,606 --> 00:11:44,075
She blew you off,
didn't she?

00:11:44,142 --> 00:11:46,177
The water from
the fountain is
heavily chlorinated.

00:11:46,244 --> 00:11:47,312
No, she didn't
blow me off.

00:11:47,379 --> 00:11:48,346
I didn't ask her out.

00:11:48,413 --> 00:11:50,081
But this sample,

00:11:50,148 --> 00:11:51,416
found in your
vic's lungs,

00:11:51,483 --> 00:11:53,418
contains polymethylhexalene
biguanide...

00:11:53,485 --> 00:11:55,420
and anyway, I heard
she blew you off first.

00:11:55,487 --> 00:11:57,055
It's a chlorine
alternative.

00:11:57,122 --> 00:11:58,523
It's less irritating.

00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:00,525
Vanessa Keaton
died in a pool.

00:12:00,592 --> 00:12:01,693
Or a spa...

00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,362
And by the way,
that's spelled S-P-A

00:12:04,429 --> 00:12:06,731
in any language.

00:12:06,798 --> 00:12:10,402
STOKES:
Only new items brought
into the arcade post-eviction

00:12:10,468 --> 00:12:13,238
were the tools, tarps
and paint cans.

00:12:13,305 --> 00:12:15,740
No prints from Charlie
Pincher on any of them.

00:12:15,807 --> 00:12:17,409
Just the landlord

00:12:17,475 --> 00:12:19,611
and some unknowns on the saw.

00:12:19,678 --> 00:12:21,012
No hits off of AFIS.

00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:22,447
According

00:12:22,514 --> 00:12:24,549
to Cavalier,
the table saw was a rental.

00:12:24,616 --> 00:12:27,419
So, there could have been any
number of prints on that one.

00:12:27,485 --> 00:12:28,553
Yeah, but you don't
just lie down

00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,988
when somebody's trying
to kill you, man.

00:12:30,055 --> 00:12:31,189
There had to have been
a struggle.

00:12:31,256 --> 00:12:32,490
Yeah, from that spinning blade,

00:12:32,557 --> 00:12:33,525
there was blood everywhere.

00:12:33,592 --> 00:12:35,193
Some of it had
to transfer

00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,462
to the killer's clothes
and shoes.

00:12:37,529 --> 00:12:39,130
I still like
Charlie for this.

00:12:39,197 --> 00:12:40,865
I know we don't
have enough

00:12:40,932 --> 00:12:43,234
for a warrant...
WOMAN:
Excuse me, guys.

00:12:43,301 --> 00:12:45,604
There's a Mr. Gleason
to see you.

00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,372
I told him you were busy.

00:12:47,439 --> 00:12:48,540
He won't leave.

00:12:50,842 --> 00:12:52,711
What's the problem,
Marty?

00:12:52,777 --> 00:12:54,546
You and you.

00:12:54,613 --> 00:12:56,948
You treat me like a janitor,
like a garbage man.

00:12:57,015 --> 00:12:59,351
I'm a professional,
same as you...

00:12:59,417 --> 00:13:02,387
an unsung hero
that's worthy of respect.

00:13:02,454 --> 00:13:03,888
Okay, Marty...

00:13:03,955 --> 00:13:06,091
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

00:13:06,157 --> 00:13:07,559
The smell back
at the store.

00:13:07,626 --> 00:13:08,627
I know decomp

00:13:08,693 --> 00:13:10,362
as well as you,
maybe better, okay?

00:13:10,428 --> 00:13:11,463
So what was it?

00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:13,098
Your lunch?

00:13:13,164 --> 00:13:15,000
Rotten shrimp? Clams, maybe?

00:13:15,066 --> 00:13:18,003
Whatever you hid there,
I am going to find.

00:13:18,069 --> 00:13:19,804
We didn't even bring
lunch there, Marty.

00:13:19,871 --> 00:13:21,239
And this wasn't a decomp scene.

00:13:21,306 --> 00:13:22,674
You're jealous.

00:13:22,741 --> 00:13:26,077
You're stuck in a dead-end
civil service job

00:13:26,144 --> 00:13:29,014
while I'm grossing
six figures.

00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,215
Oh, six figures.

00:13:30,282 --> 00:13:31,349
Yeah. Picture that.

00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:32,918
GLEASON:
We're colleagues.

00:13:32,984 --> 00:13:36,254
My job starts
where your job ends.

00:13:36,321 --> 00:13:38,123
You should not be messing
with me!

00:13:38,189 --> 00:13:40,992
Nobody's messing
with you, Marty.

00:13:50,402 --> 00:13:52,837
Phew... ooh...

00:13:54,072 --> 00:13:55,006
It's decomp.

00:13:55,073 --> 00:13:57,676
Subtle, but
it's in here.

00:13:57,742 --> 00:13:59,711
The nose knows.

00:13:59,778 --> 00:14:00,845
How'd we miss that?

00:14:00,912 --> 00:14:02,447
STOKES:
We were tired.

00:14:04,215 --> 00:14:05,717
Did you steam clean?

00:14:05,784 --> 00:14:07,218
Yeah.
The heating process

00:14:07,285 --> 00:14:09,120
must have brought
the smell out.

00:14:09,187 --> 00:14:10,822
You know,
I don't

00:14:10,889 --> 00:14:13,792
get paid until this place
smells

00:14:13,858 --> 00:14:15,226
like Eternity for Men.

00:14:19,264 --> 00:14:20,498
Could be a dead rat.

00:14:20,565 --> 00:14:23,501
Lot of possibilities.

00:14:23,568 --> 00:14:25,670
I don't know.

00:14:25,737 --> 00:14:27,405
Your guess is as good as mine.

00:14:30,008 --> 00:14:31,409
I know how to find it.

00:14:40,418 --> 00:14:41,720
Okay, rich guy.

00:14:41,786 --> 00:14:43,188
Shut down your gear,
you're taking us

00:14:43,255 --> 00:14:45,523
to lunch.

00:14:48,059 --> 00:14:49,995
KEATON:
Crack runs right through
the deep end.

00:14:50,061 --> 00:14:51,496
Had to drain it.

00:14:51,563 --> 00:14:53,231
Half the neighbors

00:14:53,298 --> 00:14:55,367
have cracked slabs,
leaky roofs.

00:14:55,433 --> 00:14:59,170
This was perfect when
Vanessa and I moved in.

00:14:59,237 --> 00:15:01,406
Place isn't built
to last.

00:15:01,473 --> 00:15:03,241
SIDLE:
Mr. Keaton,

00:15:03,308 --> 00:15:05,744
I know this must be hard
for you and your daughter.

00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:07,078
Why are you here?

00:15:07,145 --> 00:15:08,713
Your wife

00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,148
didn't die in a fountain.

00:15:10,215 --> 00:15:12,717
We're taking water samples
of every pool and spa

00:15:12,784 --> 00:15:13,785
in this community.

00:15:13,852 --> 00:15:15,921
Was there swimming
at the Brady's party?

00:15:15,987 --> 00:15:17,122
Why?

00:15:17,188 --> 00:15:18,723
Routine question.

00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:21,559
Some, I guess.

00:15:21,626 --> 00:15:23,061
It was that kind
of party.

00:15:23,128 --> 00:15:24,529
SIDLE:
Was your wife
in the pool?

00:15:24,596 --> 00:15:25,864
KEATON:
She could have been.

00:15:25,931 --> 00:15:27,565
After I left.

00:15:27,632 --> 00:15:30,568
What does this have to do
with her accident?

00:15:30,635 --> 00:15:33,405
Did anyone behave
inappropriately towards her?

00:15:33,471 --> 00:15:37,075
We were with our friends.

00:15:37,142 --> 00:15:38,743
Our <i>best</i> friends.

00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:40,278
I wouldn't have
left her there

00:15:40,345 --> 00:15:42,480
if I didn't think
she was safe.

00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,455
No one's allowed to treat
their pools with chlorine.

00:15:50,522 --> 00:15:51,690
It's in the homeowners'
regulations.

00:15:51,756 --> 00:15:52,724
What the hell
is going on?

00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:53,825
They have a warrant.

00:15:53,892 --> 00:15:55,126
A warrant for what?

00:15:55,193 --> 00:15:56,261
GRISSOM:
When was
the last time

00:15:56,328 --> 00:15:57,729
you had your pool cleaned?

00:15:57,796 --> 00:15:59,931
Guy was here
this morning. Why?

00:15:59,998 --> 00:16:01,933
We're asking the
questions, Mr. Brady.

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,235
Look, look...
we're all in shock.

00:16:04,302 --> 00:16:05,837
Vanessa was one
of those people

00:16:05,904 --> 00:16:08,740
who was so alive,
so much fun

00:16:08,807 --> 00:16:09,908
So, tell me about
last night.

00:16:09,975 --> 00:16:11,676
Was it a special occasion?

00:16:11,743 --> 00:16:13,979
We just had the neighbors
in for cocktails.

00:16:14,045 --> 00:16:15,280
We do it once a month.

00:16:15,347 --> 00:16:16,948
We, uh...
we all take turns.

00:16:17,015 --> 00:16:18,583
Was Mrs. Keaton wearing

00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:19,851
this dress last night?

00:16:19,918 --> 00:16:21,019
Yes.

00:16:22,654 --> 00:16:24,923
I noticed-- I have
the same one in pink.

00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:26,691
BRASS:
You notice anything
else, anything out
of the ordinary?

00:16:26,758 --> 00:16:28,927
Like an argument
or a fight?

00:16:28,994 --> 00:16:31,029
No, no, no.
We are a friendly group.

00:16:31,096 --> 00:16:32,998
Did she leave alone?

00:16:33,064 --> 00:16:36,001
Yes. Her husband left
about an hour earlier.

00:16:36,067 --> 00:16:37,602
He seem upset
when he left?

00:16:37,669 --> 00:16:39,371
Not that I noticed.

00:16:39,437 --> 00:16:42,374
Vanessa's death was an accident,

00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,875
right?

00:16:43,942 --> 00:16:45,410
Got it.

00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:49,614
May we take a look
inside your house?

a very strong marriage.

00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:32,878
But yes,

00:28:32,944 --> 00:28:35,747
we enjoy the lifestyle.

00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:36,948
The lifestyle?

00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:38,417
We play.

00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:41,153
Swing.

00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,056
Wife swapping.

00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:48,193
Paul and I had a rough
patch a few years ago.

00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,762
We almost called it quits.

00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:53,231
Swinging saved our marriage.

00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:55,968
It was being with
other people

00:28:56,034 --> 00:29:00,305
that made me realize
just how much I love my husband.

00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:05,310
Erin is the greatest wife
in the world.

00:29:05,377 --> 00:29:07,679
But you still had sex
with Vanessa Keaton?

00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,181
Yeah. Yeah.

00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:12,184
It's fun.

00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:20,158
How do you feel
about Vanessa Keaton?

00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:22,361
Very attractive woman.

00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:26,031
She was the reason we invited
the Keatons to the parties.

00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:27,799
She was into it.

00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:29,801
Dan really wasn't.

00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:32,604
How did your wife feel
about you and Vanessa Keaton?

00:29:32,671 --> 00:29:35,307
Well, it's not like
we were having an affair.

00:29:35,374 --> 00:29:37,109
That'd be breaking the rules.

00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:38,377
The rules?

00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:39,711
No, means no.

00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:43,548
Arrive as a couple,
leave as a couple.

00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,517
Drugs, never.

00:29:45,584 --> 00:29:47,653
Condoms, condoms always.

00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:48,687
No affairs.

00:29:48,754 --> 00:29:50,922
Sex with someone other
than your spouse

00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:52,791
is only allowed at the parties.

00:29:52,858 --> 00:29:55,527
No photos,

00:29:55,594 --> 00:29:57,062
no video.

00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,631
And the kids must never know.

00:29:59,698 --> 00:30:00,832
I came home one night.

00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:02,601
I parked the car in the driveway

00:30:02,668 --> 00:30:04,636
and went to the fridge
to grab a beer.

00:30:04,703 --> 00:30:06,204
It was the wrong beer.

00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:08,040
I was in the wrong house.

00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:09,641
Anyway, it just got

00:30:09,708 --> 00:30:12,944
all the neighbors talking.

00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:15,514
Variety is a good thing.

00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:18,517
And if you get the right
group of people together,

00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:21,386
a couple of drinks,

00:30:21,453 --> 00:30:23,188
you'd be surprised
what can happen.

00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:29,795
Everybody fantasizes
about other people.

00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:34,733
Even you, Mr. Grissom.

00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,501
A neighbor,

00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:37,803
a friend...

00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,541
girl at the office.

00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:53,852
Thank you.

00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:57,622
I know I'm supposed
to be objective...

00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:00,625
but I think I have a problem
with the lifestyle.

00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:05,330
Well, they're consenting
adults, it's not illegal.

00:31:05,397 --> 00:31:10,068
At most, they only
hurt themselves.

00:31:10,135 --> 00:31:12,337
Tell that to Vanessa Keaton.

00:31:12,404 --> 00:31:14,706
Everyone has a jealousy gene.

00:31:14,773 --> 00:31:18,243
You think it was
a crime of passion?

00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:19,378
Yeah.

00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:22,481
When you have to go outside
a marriage for passion,

00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:23,582
you're in trouble.

00:31:23,649 --> 00:31:25,283
Or your asking for trouble.

00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:28,987
Well, they say
they're happily married.

00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:31,757
You think they're happy?

00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:35,027
( <i>phone rings</i> )

00:31:37,663 --> 00:31:40,299
Grissom.

00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:43,468
Very good, thanks.

00:31:43,535 --> 00:31:48,573
Hodges matched the water
in Vanessa Keaton's lungs.

00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,609
He knows where she drowned.

00:31:58,016 --> 00:32:00,118
BRASS:
So Mr. and Mrs. Cunningham,

00:32:00,185 --> 00:32:02,254
was Vanessa Keaton here
the night she died?

00:32:02,321 --> 00:32:03,388
No.

00:32:03,455 --> 00:32:06,158
Well, we matched the water

00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:07,959
in her lungs to your spa.

00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:11,697
And I see what appears to be
a blood smear on the stone.

00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:14,266
Well, sometimes we forget
to lock the gate.

00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:15,701
So your neighbors come in
and use the spa?

00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:16,702
It's possible.

00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:17,936
Yeah, I guess so,

00:32:18,003 --> 00:32:19,638
I mean, you share
everything else.

00:32:19,705 --> 00:32:21,139
Why not?

00:32:21,206 --> 00:32:22,541
So what time
did you

00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:23,675
leave the party?

00:32:23,742 --> 00:32:25,143
Around 11:30.

00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:26,678
But we didn't come right home.

00:32:26,745 --> 00:32:27,746
BRASS:
Where'd you go?

00:32:27,813 --> 00:32:29,481
We went to the Bellagio.

00:32:29,548 --> 00:32:32,351
A nice, romantic night out,
just the two of us.

00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:34,619
Sometimes being with others

00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:36,488
gives you the urge
to be alone.

00:32:36,555 --> 00:32:38,390
BRASS:
I see.

00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:40,392
Well, we're going
to compel a DNA sample,

00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:41,793
so we'll know if you were
intimate

00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,562
with Vanessa Keaton.

00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:45,564
I admit I had sex with her

00:32:45,631 --> 00:32:47,032
and...

00:32:47,099 --> 00:32:48,567
Karen Brady,

00:32:48,634 --> 00:32:50,469
and Mallory Stone.

00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:52,004
Three strikes you're out.

00:32:57,959 --> 00:32:59,928
Heard your suspect's
looking pretty good.

00:32:59,995 --> 00:33:01,162
You heard right.

00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:03,542
Charlie confessed
to killing the landlord.

00:33:03,625 --> 00:33:05,294
And the blood on his
watch is a match

00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,795
to Visingi's DNA.

00:33:06,862 --> 00:33:07,667
What about her?

00:33:07,667 --> 00:33:09,703
Swears he has nothing
to do with it.

00:33:09,769 --> 00:33:11,638
You got a C.O.D.?

00:33:11,705 --> 00:33:13,373
Blunt-force trauma
to the occipital region.

00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,675
No trace in the wound track.

00:33:15,742 --> 00:33:18,211
Do you have any
idea what hit her?
Yeah.

00:33:18,278 --> 00:33:20,046
The impact's deep.

00:33:20,113 --> 00:33:21,715
Weapon was probably heavy.

00:33:24,517 --> 00:33:27,554
Radius of curvature,
roughly three centimeters.

00:33:27,621 --> 00:33:29,623
Could be a pipe.

00:33:29,689 --> 00:33:32,058
Could be anything.

00:33:32,125 --> 00:33:35,028
Mrs. Cunningham,
you told us that
you spent last night

00:33:35,095 --> 00:33:37,364
at the Bellagio
with your husband.

00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:39,285
That's correct.

00:33:39,352 --> 00:33:42,355
Are you sure about that?

00:33:42,422 --> 00:33:43,823
D-Do I need a lawyer?

00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:46,559
I mean, that's your call,
that's your right,

00:33:46,626 --> 00:33:49,762
but let me point out
that if you're covering
for your husband,

00:33:49,829 --> 00:33:51,664
that's conspiracy
after the fact.

00:33:51,731 --> 00:33:54,667
Now, are you prepared
to go to jail over this?

00:33:54,734 --> 00:33:57,670
( <i>chuckles</i> ):
Look, I-I answered
your question.

00:33:57,737 --> 00:34:00,006
Okay, what if I told you
the hotel maid told us

00:34:00,073 --> 00:34:02,308
that you weren't with Tom,
what would you say?

00:34:02,375 --> 00:34:04,410
I'd say she was lying.

00:34:05,712 --> 00:34:08,815
You know, I'm trying
to help you out here,

00:34:08,881 --> 00:34:11,384
and I want to help
you out, okay?

00:34:11,451 --> 00:34:13,353
But you got to
cut the crap.

00:34:13,419 --> 00:34:15,255
( <i>chuckles</i> ):
Okay?

00:34:15,321 --> 00:34:17,991
Come on, tell me
what happened.

00:34:18,057 --> 00:34:21,694
I mean, security confirmed
that you were with a female.

00:34:21,761 --> 00:34:25,265
Late 20s, blonde, I mean,

00:34:25,331 --> 00:34:27,567
she even paid for breakfast
with her credit card.

00:34:27,634 --> 00:34:32,238
So... I'll tell you what,
why don't we start over, okay?

00:34:32,305 --> 00:34:34,173
And you tell me what happened.

00:34:38,077 --> 00:34:43,082
Look, Tom asked me
to think about our son.

00:34:43,149 --> 00:34:46,786
He begged me
to say we were together.

00:34:49,422 --> 00:34:51,524
I swear, I don't know...

00:34:51,591 --> 00:34:53,693
anything that went on
between him and Vanessa.

00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,796
I don't know.

00:35:48,715 --> 00:35:50,717
Found some porn.

00:35:57,423 --> 00:35:59,626
Well, nothing new
about this stuff.

00:35:59,692 --> 00:36:01,928
The frescos at Pompeii
were more explicit.

00:36:01,995 --> 00:36:03,162
The <i>Kama Sutra</i>

00:36:03,229 --> 00:36:04,864
and <i>Decameron.</i>

00:36:04,931 --> 00:36:08,201
Yeah, but that's art;
this... is not art.

00:36:09,235 --> 00:36:11,070
Hmm.

00:36:14,507 --> 00:36:15,775
Here we go.

00:36:15,842 --> 00:36:18,478
Webcam photo.

00:36:18,544 --> 00:36:22,482
And she's wearing La Perla.

00:36:22,548 --> 00:36:24,450
Vanessa Keaton.

00:36:24,517 --> 00:36:26,886
BROWN:
<i>The first victim</i>

00:36:26,953 --> 00:36:31,591
was killed with a weapon of
opportunity, the table saw.

00:36:31,658 --> 00:36:34,494
The second victim gets
a crack on the head.

00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,764
So you're thinking
the weapon is still in here?

00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:39,866
Yeah.

00:36:39,933 --> 00:36:42,268
Why would the killer
leave it in here?

00:36:42,335 --> 00:36:44,571
Well, the killer
left the <i>body</i> here.

00:36:44,637 --> 00:36:46,606
That's true.

00:36:46,673 --> 00:36:48,541
Mr. Pincher had

00:36:48,608 --> 00:36:50,810
a cash-only business.

00:36:50,877 --> 00:36:54,347
Yeah. And he didn't
have a gun license.

00:37:01,254 --> 00:37:03,423
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:37:05,258 --> 00:37:09,028
You got something?
Yes.

00:37:18,204 --> 00:37:20,273
A little store security.

00:37:22,108 --> 00:37:25,511
Liars, liars,
all men are liars!

00:37:29,349 --> 00:37:31,284
It seems that the missus
caught her husband

00:37:31,351 --> 00:37:33,219
collecting rent

00:37:33,286 --> 00:37:34,721
from the late Melissa Pooley.

00:37:34,787 --> 00:37:36,689
She just waited till
he left the building.

00:37:36,756 --> 00:37:38,391
You slut! I don't care
what he told you,

00:37:38,458 --> 00:37:39,626
you still have
to pay rent.

00:37:39,692 --> 00:37:40,793
Go to hell!

00:37:48,534 --> 00:37:50,069
Luckily, she left
her prints behind.

00:37:50,136 --> 00:37:52,238
We had them on file
from an assault case in '98.

00:37:52,305 --> 00:37:54,140
Yeah, she went a little
further this time.

00:37:54,207 --> 00:37:58,411
Yeah, from what I hear, she did
a lousy job cleaning that bat.

00:37:58,478 --> 00:37:59,579
Amateur.

00:37:59,646 --> 00:38:00,813
You know, you guys,

00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,181
you could have waited

00:38:02,248 --> 00:38:04,484
till after she paid me
to arrest her.

00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:06,152
What did I ever
do to you?

00:38:06,219 --> 00:38:07,820
Oh, except
crack your case

00:38:07,887 --> 00:38:10,757
wide open.
Don't worry, man,

00:38:10,823 --> 00:38:13,393
Grissom talked to the
sheriff, said he's gonna
pick up your tab.

00:38:13,459 --> 00:38:14,594
Really?

00:38:14,661 --> 00:38:16,829
Mm-hmm.
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:38:16,896 --> 00:38:19,198
Thanks.

00:38:19,265 --> 00:38:21,200
Hey, you think this could mean

00:38:21,267 --> 00:38:24,571
a nice, fat city contract
for me?

00:38:24,637 --> 00:38:27,307
Good to see you, Marty.

00:38:27,373 --> 00:38:29,108
See you around, Marty.

00:38:30,877 --> 00:38:32,512
Call me.

00:38:48,828 --> 00:38:51,531
Innie, outie.

00:38:55,668 --> 00:38:58,638
And Vanessa doesn't have
any moles on her torso.

00:38:58,705 --> 00:39:00,139
The woman in the photo
is not Vanessa.

00:39:01,608 --> 00:39:02,775
Oh, you got my message.

00:39:02,842 --> 00:39:03,943
What message?

00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:04,944
To meet me here.

00:39:05,011 --> 00:39:05,979
I was preparing a body

00:39:06,045 --> 00:39:07,547
for a mortuary pickup,

00:39:07,614 --> 00:39:09,415
and I noticed something.

00:39:11,784 --> 00:39:13,686
Postmortem bruising.

GRISSOM:
Well, it can take a day or two

00:39:15,288 --> 00:39:17,156
after autopsy
for the bruises to percolate

00:39:17,223 --> 00:39:19,158
through the soft tissue
and become visible.

00:39:19,225 --> 00:39:21,527
Vanessa wasn't stabbed
four times with a skewer.

00:39:21,594 --> 00:39:24,230
She was stabbed twice
with a two-pronged instrument.

between Cunningham's

Any attachments?

Yeah.

She's 15.

Does she look 15 to you?
Tom,

00:41:25,351 --> 00:41:26,920
be very quiet.

00:41:26,986 --> 00:41:29,088
They got me on tape.
I'm trying to explain.

00:41:29,155 --> 00:41:32,091
She's a minor, you're an adult.
What's to explain?

00:41:32,158 --> 00:41:33,660
We have information

00:41:33,726 --> 00:41:35,228

Amy,

00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:49,676
you e-mailed this photo
of yourself to Tom Cunningham.

00:41:49,742 --> 00:41:51,377
What's she talking about?

00:41:51,444 --> 00:41:53,179
I have no idea.

00:41:53,246 --> 00:41:54,948
You were having an affair
with Tom Cunningham.

00:41:55,014 --> 00:41:56,149
He's just been booked

00:41:56,215 --> 00:41:57,717
on statutory rape.

00:41:57,784 --> 00:41:59,485
What?!
It wasn't rape.

who I have sex with?

I know about your parties,

00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:06,359
all the kids know,
so don't get all
righteous on me.

00:42:06,426 --> 00:42:07,627
I want to see Tom.
Let's go.

GRISSOM:
Mr. Keaton, sit down, please.

00:42:09,062 --> 00:42:10,129
We're not done yet.

00:42:16,736 --> 00:42:20,039
We retrieved this from
the Cunningham's backyard.

00:42:20,106 --> 00:42:21,808
Your stepmother's blood

00:42:21,874 --> 00:42:23,142

MAN:
Easy, easy.

00:42:39,325 --> 00:42:41,227
The stab wounds weren't fatal,

00:42:41,294 --> 00:42:43,997
but your stepmother
was knocked unconscious.

00:42:44,063 --> 00:42:46,099
It took two or three
minutes for her to drown.

00:42:46,165 --> 00:42:48,268
GRISSOM:
That's a long time
to stand around

00:42:48,334 --> 00:42:49,903
and watch someone die.

00:42:49,969 --> 00:42:51,704
It wasn't like that.

00:42:52,839 --> 00:42:55,441
How could you!
Calm down!

00:42:55,508 --> 00:43:00,346
You need to go home,
right now.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

00:43:00,413 --> 00:43:03,016
He was trying to protect me.

00:43:04,350 --> 00:43:06,986
So we put her in the fountain.

00:43:10,323 --> 00:43:12,458
He loves me.

00:43:15,762 --> 00:43:17,297
Can I see him?

00:43:23,236 --> 00:43:25,238
Arrive as a couple,
leave as a couple.

00:43:25,305 --> 00:43:28,333
No photos, no video.
No affairs.

00:43:28,792 --> 00:43:30,500
And the kids
must never know.
