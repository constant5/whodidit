( <i>engine roaring</i> )

00:00:19,668 --> 00:00:22,671
( <i>siren whoops, engine revs</i> )

00:00:32,314 --> 00:00:33,481
Officer...

00:00:33,548 --> 00:00:35,125
thank God you're here.

00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:36,060
You know why
I stopped you?

00:00:36,126 --> 00:00:38,596
Yeah, I... I...
I was speeding, uh...

00:00:38,662 --> 00:00:40,931
of course, but you have
to understand, you see,

00:00:40,998 --> 00:00:41,999
someone is chasing me.

00:00:43,167 --> 00:00:44,635
You see, I have videos.

00:00:44,702 --> 00:00:45,636
I bet you do.

00:00:45,703 --> 00:00:47,471
Let's start with
license and registration.

00:00:49,874 --> 00:00:53,277
Officer, if I could...
if I could just show you.

00:01:11,208 --> 00:01:13,344
WILLOWS:
Found a camcorder.

00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:15,346
No tape inside.

00:01:21,752 --> 00:01:23,387
Not much traffic.

00:01:23,454 --> 00:01:26,023
Makes it a lot easier to run
someone off the road...

00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:28,058
...and slash their throat.

00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:32,296
She was slashed south
of the border, as well.

00:01:34,632 --> 00:01:37,134
Women in convertibles

00:01:37,201 --> 00:01:39,503
are low-hanging fruit.

00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,906
And it was a top-down night.

00:01:45,309 --> 00:01:47,077
and TOYOTA.
Choose any direction,

00:01:47,144 --> 00:01:49,246
as long as it's moving forward.

It's at least four carats.

00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:34,221
We've been shopping.

00:02:34,288 --> 00:02:38,458
Lots of surgical
procedures here:

00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:42,696
artificial breasts,
cheek implants...

00:02:42,763 --> 00:02:44,431
collagen lips...

00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:46,033
You'd be surprised
how many women

00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:47,568
I get on this table
with fake parts.

00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:50,270
Plastic lasts longer.

00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:12,993
Wow. Mascara,

00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:16,430
tweezers...
under-eye cream...

00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:20,167
...neck-firming lotion.
Girls.

00:03:20,234 --> 00:03:22,135
Pads...

00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:25,405
One, two, three, four

00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:28,308
jars of depilatory cream?

00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,010
That's a lot of bikini wax.

00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:31,945
Some girls hate
the nether-stubble.

00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:34,548
Nether-stubble?

00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,088
Swipe card.

00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:42,656
Entertainment Department,
Tangiers.

00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:49,896
Well...

00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:51,999
Walter Clancy
didn't mind stubble.

00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,533
Who's Walter?

00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,136
The registered owner
of this vehicle.

00:03:56,203 --> 00:03:58,939
So she either
borrowed this car...

00:03:59,006 --> 00:04:00,307
or she stole it.

00:04:01,942 --> 00:04:04,878
Genital wounds were more
profound than I expected.

00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:06,880
Profound how?

00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:08,415
Well, I was looking for ovaries
and I found a prostate.

00:04:10,284 --> 00:04:11,818
She was a he?

00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:13,387
"She" had genital

00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:15,122
reassignment surgery.

00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:16,823
And what does that mean exactly?

00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,125
Exactly?

00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:20,060
Her testicles were removed

00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:22,095
and her penis was inverted,
creating a vagina.

00:04:23,664 --> 00:04:25,632
And, evidently, the killer
kept subtracting.

00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:27,000
Subtracting what?

00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:28,235
Well, they don't call
it an Adam's apple

00:04:28,302 --> 00:04:29,903
for nothing.

00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:33,040
A man with issues might become
upset if he found one

00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,408
on his woman.

00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:35,742
Cause?

00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:38,078
Severed carotid
and jugular complex.

00:04:38,145 --> 00:04:41,315
Uh, incised wounds are
almost surgical in nature.

00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:43,417
Used an extremely
sharp weapon.

00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:44,418
Vicious attack.

00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:46,820
Probably from someone
emotionally involved.

00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:48,455
Time?
Best estimate,

00:04:48,522 --> 00:04:49,990
between 8:00 and midnight.

00:04:50,057 --> 00:04:51,792
I collected a standard SAE kit.

00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:52,826
WILLOWS:
Good.

00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:54,661
Because top or bottom,

00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:57,864
this looks like a sexual assault
that turned into a hate crime.

00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:00,934
OFFICER:
Clock a Thunderbird doing 90.

00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:02,336
I nail it.

00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:04,605
The skirt driving tells me
she's being chased.

00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:08,475
And then she asks if she can
show me some videos.

00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:09,309
How were they?

00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:10,711
I didn't bite.

00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:12,045
She was working it.

00:05:12,112 --> 00:05:14,014
Rough duty.

00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:15,148
Look, she gave me
this lame story

00:05:15,215 --> 00:05:16,950
about the car
being her brother's,

00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:18,285
and that she had
lost her license,

00:05:18,352 --> 00:05:19,953
but she has his license,

00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,288
and yakety-yak.

00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:23,023
I just let her off
with a warning.

00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,691
So you had speeding,

00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:26,860
driving without a license,
possible stolen vehicle,

00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:28,629
and you let her off
with a warning.

00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:30,731
What are you implying?

00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:32,899
She got off pretty easy.

00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:34,134
How about you?

00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:35,535
I resent that.

00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:37,104
Well, I'm sure
that she resented

00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,139
being sexually harassed
and slaughtered two miles

00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:40,807
from the place
you pulled her over!
I didn't know

00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:42,376
about that until
you called me in here.

00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:44,378
You know, you have a sexual
harassment flag in your file.

00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:45,679
Oh, so that makes me
a sex murderer?

00:05:45,746 --> 00:05:48,015
I know a place
about two miles up.

00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:49,449
It's a little more private.

00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,084
I mean, you know,
if... if I found out

00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:53,820
that the gal who was
stripping my gears was a guy,

00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:55,355
I mean, I'd be mad, too.

00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:00,627
( <i>groaning</i> )

00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:01,995
What <i>are you?!</i>
( <i>screams</i> )

00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:04,665
Or maybe you prefer a stick.

00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,135
I told you, nothing happened.

00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,871
You're on administrative duty
until we confirm that.

00:06:10,938 --> 00:06:12,306
Mind submitting your DNA?

00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,309
Just tell me where to spit.

00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,645
Ran her prints through
I-AFIS and I got two hits.

00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,847
A Wendy Garner

00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:24,184
was a dancer at the Tangiers,
and Walter Clancy,

00:06:24,251 --> 00:06:27,287
a blackjack dealer
at the Riviera in the mid-'90s.

00:06:27,354 --> 00:06:28,622
Okay,

00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:30,390
let's give this a shot.

00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:33,026
The coroner noted that she had
collagened lips.

00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,997
Okay, so 86
those cheek implants.

00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:44,204
Now, estrogen
would've

00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:47,441
rounded out the face,
so square that jaw.

00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:50,611
JOHNSON:
Got that.

00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:52,346
I'm gonna give her a haircut.

00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:57,751
Add some whiskers...

00:06:57,818 --> 00:06:59,453
BROWN:
Wow.

00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:01,255
Take away the, uh...

00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:02,556
eye makeup.

00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:04,224
JOHNSON:
And I'll fix the eyebrows.

00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:05,826
Well, one thing's for certain:

00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:07,761
Walter didn't kill Wendy.

00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:09,129
BROWN:
No,

00:07:09,196 --> 00:07:11,231
it's more like
Wendy killed Walter.

00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:16,803
Okay, Wendy's mouth had
two foreign DNA donors:

00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,505
One seminal, one saliva.

00:07:18,572 --> 00:07:20,507
Neither was a match
for Officer Mann.

00:07:20,574 --> 00:07:21,642
Huh.

00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:24,144
Wow. That is some rock.

00:07:24,211 --> 00:07:25,812
Platinum setting.

00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:28,015
Princess cut.

00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:30,584
Somebody really loved
her-- oh-- him.

00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:33,086
I think she's a her.

00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:35,022
Right. Well...

00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:37,491
a diamond that big, you
hope <i>she</i> had it LoJacked.

00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:38,825
That is what I'm counting on.

00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:41,762
There's a serial number
micro-etched into the band

00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:44,131
around the diamond--
I'm hoping it gets me a groom.

00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,969
You know, I once
heard this story

00:07:49,036 --> 00:07:50,904
about this man who
became a woman

00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:53,607
because he was obsessed
with a lesbian...

00:07:53,674 --> 00:07:54,841
who was really a man.

00:07:57,411 --> 00:07:59,046
Overshare.

00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:07,287
Wendy just bought
her wedding gown.

00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:08,855
She, uh,

00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:10,424
she would've been
a beautiful bride.

00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:14,528
We just wrote our
wedding vows last week.

00:08:14,595 --> 00:08:16,096
I just figured

00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:17,965
that she was
at a friend's house--

00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:19,700
a girlfriend's house--
for the night.

00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:20,667
Mr. Laner,

00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:21,902
how long had Wendy

00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:23,136
been a dancer?

00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:25,305
About two or three years
in the line.

00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:27,174
I mean, never topless.

00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:30,477
In her costume,
she was a vision.

00:08:30,544 --> 00:08:32,446
How long had you known
each other?

00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,447
About a year.

00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,681
We met in a Grief Support Group.

00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:36,550
I'd lost my wife.

00:08:36,617 --> 00:08:38,151
Sorry for your loss.

00:08:38,218 --> 00:08:39,820
Thank you.

00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:42,656
Who was Wendy
grieving for?

00:08:42,723 --> 00:08:45,192
Uh, she'd... lost
her twin brother.

00:08:47,461 --> 00:08:48,762
Would that be Walter?

00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:50,764
Yeah, Walter.

00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:52,399
Did you know him?

00:08:52,466 --> 00:08:55,269
Sort of.

00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:33,073
♪ ♪

00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,496
Mr. Laner, I need to ask
you a personal question,

00:10:29,563 --> 00:10:31,431
if you don't mind--
it may help us.

00:10:31,498 --> 00:10:34,568
Did you and your fiancee
sleep in separate beds?

00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:36,270
Uh...

00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:38,005
we were an old-fashioned couple.

00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:39,539
Neither of us
believed in

00:10:39,606 --> 00:10:42,209
premarital sexual relations.

00:10:42,276 --> 00:10:44,011
I mean, that's why
I fell in love with her,

00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:45,712
because of her
traditional values.

00:10:48,415 --> 00:10:49,683
This is confusing.

00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,585
BRASS:
<i>She</i> had her period?

00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:54,087
Impossible.
No uterus, no period.

00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,923
So a guy desperate
to change his sex

00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:57,891
hooks up with a guy
desperate not to have any.

00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,126
A match made in heaven.

00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:01,528
I think we need to tell
Mr. Laner the truth.

00:11:01,595 --> 00:11:03,063
Are we sure
he doesn't know?

00:11:10,667 --> 00:11:12,202
( <i>cheering and applause</i> )

00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,219
Aborigines say
they dance naked

00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:27,587
to make the gods happy.

00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:29,322
The gods would be
happy in Vegas.

00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:31,925
Did you ever see
any transsexuals

00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:33,259
when you danced?

00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:36,496
Only civilians
confuse strippers
and showgirls.

00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:38,765
You can't cheat
the full monty.

00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:45,605
That's Wendy's
station over there.

00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:48,541
Thank you.

00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:49,909
Hello, ladies.

00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:51,611
I'm Catherine Willows.

00:11:51,678 --> 00:11:53,246
This is Gil Grissom.
We're with the Crime Lab.

00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:56,516
Do any of you know if
Wendy Garner worked last night?

00:11:56,583 --> 00:12:00,487
No, she had the day off.

00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,622
But she should be
working tonight.

00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:03,756
And she is late.

00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:04,958
That's not like her.

00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:06,793
Why, did something
happen to Wendy?

00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:10,263
Unfortunately,
she was found dead last night.

00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:14,234
It was all those hormones
she was taking, wasn't it?

00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,136
Shut up. What do you know?

00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:17,337
GRISSOM:
Do you know

00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,038
that Wendy was a, uh...?

00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:20,039
Trannie?

00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:21,808
All the best
showgirls are.

00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,510
Yeah, and it don't matter

00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:26,146
if they're packin'
a lop job or a gaff.

00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:27,847
Okay, lop job I get.

00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:29,249
What's a gaff?

00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:31,384
It's like a jockstrap,
only it hides

00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:33,153
what it's supposed to strap.

00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:34,654
We all get work done.
Who cares

00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:37,157
if it's up north or down south?

00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:38,758
Pretty's pretty.

00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:40,226
So do you know where

00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:42,662
<i>she</i> got her work done?

00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:46,332
You want the best,
you go to Dr. Mercer.

00:12:47,734 --> 00:12:50,503
WOMAN:
<i>Okay, so on tonight's agenda,</i>

00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,338
we're going to be talking
about hair removal,

00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:54,707
gait, and we'll
do our pride walk,

00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,910
hormones, and voice pitch...

00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:58,178
Ladies, come on.

00:12:58,244 --> 00:12:59,179
Over here.

00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:01,181
Now, regarding hair removal...

00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:03,016
Are they all women?

00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:06,953
The ratio of MTFs
to FTMs is four to one.

00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,955
Males to females rather
than females to males?

00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:12,125
Bev is one
of my patients.

00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:14,661
Right. Now, who hasn't done
their pride walk?

00:13:15,762 --> 00:13:17,964
The law requires
re-gender candidates

00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:19,799
to spend one year on hormones

00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:22,135
and one living
as the sex of preference.

00:13:22,202 --> 00:13:24,471
Wendy wanted to fast-track
the process

00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:25,805
and I wouldn't do that.

00:13:25,872 --> 00:13:28,608
I guess she found
somebody who would.

00:13:28,675 --> 00:13:30,910
Every field has
its bottom feeders.

00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:32,645
Surgery is the easy part.

00:13:32,712 --> 00:13:34,914
Life afterwards
is the challenge.

00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:37,217
Some candidates
get depressed.

00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:39,352
They're unhappy about their
lives and they think surgery

00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:41,387
is going to chase away
all their emotional problems.

00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:43,122
Dr. Mercer,

00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:45,792
Wendy didn't commit suicide.
She was killed.

00:13:45,859 --> 00:13:50,530
Oh, God.

00:13:50,597 --> 00:13:51,764
I am so sorry.

00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,433
As ready as
my patients

00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,667
are for the world,

00:13:54,734 --> 00:13:57,237
I guess the world
isn't always ready for them.

00:13:58,838 --> 00:13:59,772
Hey.
Hey.

00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,941
Anything on those pads
I collected?

00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:04,377
Uh, yeah,
traces of EDTA.

00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:05,845
Isn't that an
anticoagulant?

00:14:05,912 --> 00:14:07,814
Yeah. Used in
blood-collection vials.

00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:09,315
So it wasn't
the victim's blood?

00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:11,117
No, it was hers.

00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,219
His?
Hers.

00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:14,621
But no epithelials
or fibrinogen,

00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:15,989
so clearly
it wasn't menstrual.

00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:18,558
So Wendy was having
blood drawn

00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,493
and putting it
on pads?

00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,262
She was faking
her period.

00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:33,339
What I don't get
is why she would do that.

00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:35,241
Well, she was living
as a woman,

00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:36,476
and that's
part of it.

00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,577
I-I don't know.

00:14:37,644 --> 00:14:39,646
But you don't draw
your own blood.

00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,347
I mean, she had
to have help.

00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:42,582
Maybe the same doctor

00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:45,018
that was keeping
her medicine cabinet filled.

00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:46,486
Hey, these are
the pills

00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:49,455
Eric collected
from Wendy Garner's
bathroom.

00:14:49,522 --> 00:14:51,558
For the record,
I really like having a penis.

00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:53,827
Okay,

00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,062
the reds and blues
are bootleg estrogen conjugates

00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:57,964
out of Mexico.

00:14:58,031 --> 00:14:59,866
Apparently, HMO's don't consider
being differently sexed

00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:02,135
a life-threatening condition.

00:15:02,202 --> 00:15:04,804
So patients resort
to Mexican pharmacies.

00:15:04,871 --> 00:15:05,905
Premarin's green,

00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:08,174
a heavy-duty hormonal
supplement.

00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,777
Name's short
for "Pregnant Mare Urine."

00:15:10,844 --> 00:15:12,479
Talk about
your PETA nightmare.

00:15:12,545 --> 00:15:14,380
What about these other pills?

00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:16,983
Mexican-grade painkillers,
tranquilizers,

00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:20,353
and a broad-spectrum antibiotic.

00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,723
Sounds like
a post-surgery
cocktail to me.

00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,859
( <i>phone rings</i> )

00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,694
Grissom.

00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,062
Yes.

00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:32,065
Mimosa?

00:15:32,132 --> 00:15:35,201
Yes. Today?

00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:39,739
The Apple Martini, 1:00.

00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:42,609
I'll be here.

00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:44,310
Did you just get
a lunch date?

00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,601
Hello.

00:16:13,668 --> 00:16:16,070
I'm glad you
agreed to meet me.

00:16:16,137 --> 00:16:18,406
Can I buy you
a drink?

00:16:18,472 --> 00:16:20,408
Thanks, but I'm still
on the clock.

00:16:20,474 --> 00:16:23,911
But you still let me
lure you away from the lab.

00:16:23,978 --> 00:16:26,480
Is that because
I'm a beautiful woman?

00:16:26,547 --> 00:16:28,783
Well,

00:16:28,849 --> 00:16:31,886
I'm a beautiful woman now.

00:16:31,952 --> 00:16:33,287
Beauty is a societal
construction.

00:16:33,354 --> 00:16:34,622
So is gender.

00:16:34,689 --> 00:16:38,259
People find out you're MTF,
and they think you're psycho;

00:16:38,326 --> 00:16:40,294
Michael Caine
with a bad wig

00:16:40,361 --> 00:16:43,230
and a pair of sunglasses
stabbing Angie Dickinson

00:16:43,297 --> 00:16:44,665
in <i>Dressed To Kill.</i>

00:16:44,732 --> 00:16:46,834
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:16:46,901 --> 00:16:48,869
De Palma had some issues.

00:16:51,138 --> 00:16:52,840
You're an outsider.

00:16:52,907 --> 00:16:55,242
That's why I trusted you.

00:16:55,309 --> 00:16:57,211
You get it.

00:16:58,813 --> 00:17:01,215
Don't worry, Mr. Grissom.

00:17:01,282 --> 00:17:03,784
This isn't about sex.

00:17:03,851 --> 00:17:04,986
It's about soul.

00:17:05,052 --> 00:17:08,589
What was it you that you wanted
to trust me with?

00:17:08,656 --> 00:17:13,427
I loved Wendy.

00:17:13,494 --> 00:17:17,164
I was there with her
through her whole transition.

00:17:17,231 --> 00:17:20,267
I was going to be
her maid of honor.

00:17:20,334 --> 00:17:21,902
Do you know how hard

00:17:21,969 --> 00:17:25,006
it is for people like us
to find love?

00:17:25,072 --> 00:17:26,607
Do you know
what happened?

00:17:26,674 --> 00:17:27,608
She called me,

00:17:27,675 --> 00:17:30,878
hysterical.

00:17:30,945 --> 00:17:32,113
Uh, I don't know.

00:17:32,179 --> 00:17:35,683
She kept going on
about a videotape or something.

00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,152
What kind of tape,
do you know?

00:17:38,219 --> 00:17:39,987
Blackmail?
Pornography?

00:17:40,054 --> 00:17:41,288
Porn? ( <i>laughs</i> )

00:17:41,355 --> 00:17:42,390
Oh, my God.

00:17:42,456 --> 00:17:45,526
Wendy was such a prude,
she'd cover the mirror

00:17:45,593 --> 00:17:47,662
when she got out
of the shower.

00:17:47,728 --> 00:17:49,196
People confuse
your obsession
with sexuality

00:17:49,263 --> 00:17:51,999
as an obsession with sex.

00:17:52,066 --> 00:17:55,903
Imagine being three years old,

00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:59,373
tormented by the sensation
that you had the wrong parts.

00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,175
Your body's like
a foreign country

00:18:01,242 --> 00:18:04,645
and you're stuck
without a passport.

00:18:04,712 --> 00:18:06,314
All because in
your first trimester

00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:10,785
your "X" and "Y"
chromosomes split off

00:18:10,851 --> 00:18:13,721
and went different directions;

00:18:13,788 --> 00:18:15,389
girl brain, boy body.

00:18:15,456 --> 00:18:17,758
It's like
the Guiterman poem:

00:18:17,825 --> 00:18:21,028
"Amoebas at the start
were not complex.

00:18:21,095 --> 00:18:25,232
But then they tore
themselves apart
and started sex."

00:18:25,299 --> 00:18:26,534
Well, in the beginning,

00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,437
Wendy's chromosomes might have
been tearing themselves apart,

00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:33,874
but in the end,
she was tearing herself apart.

00:18:33,941 --> 00:18:34,875
Do you know why?

00:18:34,942 --> 00:18:36,744
I don't know.
Planning a wedding,

00:18:36,811 --> 00:18:38,212
working a rookie vagina,

00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:41,515
and about to lose her cherry
to a man who doesn't know?

00:18:41,582 --> 00:18:43,551
So she talked to you?

00:18:43,617 --> 00:18:45,920
She talked about it in group.

00:18:45,987 --> 00:18:48,823
May I ask the name
of your therapist?

00:18:51,058 --> 00:18:52,960
Dr. Lavalle.

00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:10,578
Hey, I've been looking for you.

00:19:10,645 --> 00:19:12,780
You found me.

00:19:12,847 --> 00:19:15,983
I analyzed the blood
on the shoes you gave me.

00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:17,318
I expected it to be
Wendy's blood.

00:19:17,385 --> 00:19:18,586
It's not hers

00:19:18,653 --> 00:19:20,554
and it's not Officer Mann's.

00:19:20,621 --> 00:19:22,723
So it might be
the killer's.

00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:25,626
Well, given the nature
of this case,

00:19:25,693 --> 00:19:27,862
it might be misleading,
but I'll ask anyway--

00:19:27,928 --> 00:19:28,996
male or female?

00:19:29,063 --> 00:19:32,667
One donor. All male.

00:19:36,834 --> 00:19:37,768
Lepidro.

00:19:37,835 --> 00:19:38,625
What kind of name
is that?

00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:39,559
It's from <i>Lepidoptera,</i>

00:19:39,626 --> 00:19:40,625
meaning "butterfly."

00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:41,793
Walter Clancy
started out

00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,361
a gender-dysmorphic
caterpillar

00:19:43,428 --> 00:19:45,931
and turned into
a bloody butterfly.

00:19:49,542 --> 00:19:51,166
Bye-bye, scrumptious pumpkin.

00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:53,168
Bye, Amber.

00:19:54,369 --> 00:19:55,904
Dr. Lavalle?

00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:56,938
No, I'm Francis.

00:19:57,005 --> 00:19:58,039
My wife is the doc.

00:19:58,106 --> 00:19:59,541
AMBER:
Grownups always
do that.

00:19:59,607 --> 00:20:02,077
It's gender-stereotyping,
honey.

00:20:02,143 --> 00:20:04,713
Okay, Francis. I'm Jim
Brass, Las Vegas Police.

00:20:04,779 --> 00:20:06,347
This is Gil Grissom
from the Crime Lab.

00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:10,218
Well, if I'm being,
intrusive, please tell me,

00:20:10,285 --> 00:20:12,787
but, I mean,
why are you here?

00:20:12,854 --> 00:20:14,389
Wendy Garner.

00:20:14,456 --> 00:20:16,191
I know Wendy.

00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:17,425
She's a patient.

00:20:17,492 --> 00:20:19,761
She was a patient.

00:20:22,397 --> 00:20:23,832
My wife is in group.

00:20:25,366 --> 00:20:26,901
MAN:
This is really frustrating.

00:20:26,968 --> 00:20:27,969
They don't get it.

00:20:28,036 --> 00:20:30,839
She is a beautiful woman now

00:20:30,905 --> 00:20:32,040
and I love her.

00:20:32,107 --> 00:20:33,775
Our pastor doesn't know.

00:20:33,842 --> 00:20:35,210
You need to tell him.

00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:36,878
The truth goes a long way.

00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,247
Mona?

00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:42,083
These folks need
to speak to you.

00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:44,953
Eddie, would you take over?

00:20:45,019 --> 00:20:46,755
Sure.

00:20:46,821 --> 00:20:50,058
In the Sanctuary Alliance

00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:51,659
I saw an Eritrean girl

00:20:51,726 --> 00:20:54,162
who had her labia
sewn shut.

00:20:54,229 --> 00:20:56,965
I looked into her eyes
and I found a cause.

00:20:57,031 --> 00:21:01,403
6,000 women a day
suffer genital mutilation.

00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:03,238
So you travel
around the world

00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:05,807
treating the victims
of sexual treachery?

00:21:05,874 --> 00:21:07,108
You don't have
to travel

00:21:07,175 --> 00:21:09,244
to find the genitally
disenfranchised.

00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,812
Like Wendy Garner?

00:21:10,879 --> 00:21:13,915
Wendy came to me.
She was denied surgery.

00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:15,417
That's devastating.

00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:19,821
I tried to help her
work through that.

00:21:19,888 --> 00:21:22,924
By finding a doctor
who would operate on her?

00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:23,925
By working with her

00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:25,326
on what made her
an unacceptable candidate.

00:21:25,393 --> 00:21:27,195
Which was?

00:21:27,262 --> 00:21:28,196
Patience.

00:21:28,263 --> 00:21:30,298
When was the last time
you saw her?

00:21:30,365 --> 00:21:31,299
Last night.

00:21:31,366 --> 00:21:33,501
7:00 to 8:00 for her individual
consultation.

00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:34,569
How did she seem?

00:21:34,636 --> 00:21:35,637
She was agitated.

00:21:35,703 --> 00:21:38,206
She was worried
about whether her fiancee

00:21:38,273 --> 00:21:41,209
would receive her well
on their wedding night.

00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,945
So he didn't know?

00:21:44,012 --> 00:21:47,615
I don't recommend
what we call "passing."

00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:49,117
I suggested that Aaron
come at a group.

00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:52,487
Wendy was adamant
that he never know the truth.

00:21:52,554 --> 00:21:56,024
Doctor, do you videotape
your sessions?

00:21:56,091 --> 00:21:57,358
No, never.

00:21:57,425 --> 00:21:59,427
That would violate
the doctor-patient privilege.

00:22:01,262 --> 00:22:03,698
STOKES:
Wendy lived here

00:22:03,765 --> 00:22:06,401
at 118 Sunshine Road
in Green Valley.

00:22:06,468 --> 00:22:09,471
She left
her weekly session
with Dr. Lavalle

00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:10,805
at 8:00 p.m. here.

00:22:10,872 --> 00:22:12,507
Now, Officer Mann
pulled her over

00:22:12,574 --> 00:22:14,642
on Industrial Road
24 minutes later.

00:22:14,709 --> 00:22:17,312
She was found dead
two miles south

00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:18,980
of there,

00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:20,749
supposedly on her way
to her friend

00:22:20,815 --> 00:22:22,484
Mimosa's house here.

00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,018
Takes ten minutes
to drive from

00:22:24,085 --> 00:22:26,554
the clinic
to Industrial Road.

00:22:26,621 --> 00:22:27,689
Yeah.
Yeah.

00:22:27,756 --> 00:22:29,257
I had Greg run it.

00:22:29,324 --> 00:22:30,592
( <i>chuckles and</i>
<i>mutters softly</i> )

00:22:30,658 --> 00:22:32,827
14 minutes of Wendy's time

00:22:32,894 --> 00:22:33,862
unaccounted for.

00:22:33,928 --> 00:22:35,029
That's what
I'm saying.

00:22:35,096 --> 00:22:36,831
She must've stopped
somewhere between the clinic

00:22:36,898 --> 00:22:40,235
and where Officer Mann
clocked her doing 90.

00:22:40,301 --> 00:22:41,503
Somewhere in this
highlighted area.

00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:43,605
Yeah, but there's
nothing out there.

00:22:43,671 --> 00:22:44,639
Not so fast.

00:22:44,706 --> 00:22:46,241
Sara found this
in the medicine cabinet.

00:22:46,307 --> 00:22:47,275
It's a Post-It.

00:22:47,342 --> 00:22:50,412
"G-105, Section E."

00:22:50,478 --> 00:22:53,381
What does that have to do
with her medicine cabinet?

00:22:53,448 --> 00:22:55,650
Doesn't have anything to do
with the medicine cabinet.

00:22:55,717 --> 00:22:56,918
I thought it was
map coordinates

00:22:56,985 --> 00:22:58,053
or something like that,

00:22:58,119 --> 00:22:59,087
but it's not.

00:22:59,154 --> 00:23:01,656
You know what they
have a lot of

00:23:01,723 --> 00:23:03,124
up in this area?

00:23:03,191 --> 00:23:04,926
Storage facilities.

00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:19,777
What's the number again?

00:23:19,844 --> 00:23:20,778
G-105.

00:23:20,845 --> 00:23:22,012
Should be right
down here.

00:23:24,048 --> 00:23:25,883
Hey, hey, watch your step.
Watch your step.

00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:26,984
I got footprints.

00:23:28,486 --> 00:23:30,321
Those look like
bloody footprints.

00:23:30,387 --> 00:23:33,123
Yeah.

00:24:12,263 --> 00:24:13,697
Nick, hit the lights.

00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,301
Oh, no.

00:24:43,208 --> 00:24:44,443
STOKES:
Catherine.

00:24:44,509 --> 00:24:45,834
Yeah?

00:24:45,834 --> 00:24:47,291
What do you think went on here?

00:24:47,291 --> 00:24:49,660
Someone outsourced
their health care

00:24:49,727 --> 00:24:52,063
to the wrong provider.

00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:00,638
At least...

00:25:00,705 --> 00:25:03,407
<i>something</i> was sterile.

00:25:03,474 --> 00:25:05,643
Maybe why I'm not getting
any prints.

00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:08,412
Hey.
Hi, Jim.

00:25:08,479 --> 00:25:11,148
So I, uh...
I talked to the manager.

00:25:11,215 --> 00:25:14,151
All he said was,
the renter paid cash,

00:25:14,218 --> 00:25:16,954
he was a guy, he seemed normal.

00:25:17,021 --> 00:25:20,891
Normal people don't torture
people in storage bins.

00:25:23,127 --> 00:25:25,262
( <i>horn honks in distance</i> )

00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:34,305
ROBBINS:
Piano wires.

00:25:34,372 --> 00:25:36,040
They're used to mobilize
the lower part

00:25:36,107 --> 00:25:38,242
of the abdominal skin
and anchor the neo-vagina,

00:25:38,309 --> 00:25:39,510
so it can heal in place.

00:25:39,577 --> 00:25:41,579
WILLOWS:
I can only imagine

00:25:41,645 --> 00:25:42,613
those cramps.

00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,814
The surgeon stuffs
the portal

00:25:43,881 --> 00:25:45,649
with a cylinder
wrapped in gauze

00:25:45,716 --> 00:25:48,786
to hold its shape
while it heals, and sutures it.

00:25:48,853 --> 00:25:52,423
( <i>sighs</i> ):
And how long does milady
have to wear a wire?

00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:54,592
Well, after five days,
the vagina is un-sutured,

00:25:54,658 --> 00:25:55,826
and the wires are removed.

00:25:55,893 --> 00:25:58,329
Scarring indicates

00:25:58,396 --> 00:25:59,897
multiple surgeries.

00:25:59,964 --> 00:26:03,634
She appears to have
gone in for repair
due to infection.

00:26:03,701 --> 00:26:06,203
I take it that
wasn't supposed to happen.

00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:09,040
Maybe someone wasn't
taking their hormones.

00:26:09,106 --> 00:26:11,475
Or they were taking
some bad Mexican bootlegs.

00:26:11,542 --> 00:26:12,677
Now,

00:26:12,743 --> 00:26:15,012
that is more than
a five o'clock shadow.

00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:17,448
It's a myth that hair
grows after death.

00:26:17,515 --> 00:26:19,383
What happens is,
the skin contracts,

00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:21,619
revealing whiskers.

00:26:21,686 --> 00:26:24,689
<i>Contraction of the erector</i>

00:26:26,624 --> 00:26:27,992
was at least two days ago.

00:26:28,059 --> 00:26:29,794
So she died before Wendy.

00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:32,730
Yeah, sad as this is,
it presents as accidental.

00:26:32,797 --> 00:26:35,166
Loss of blood due
to hemorrhaging.

00:26:35,232 --> 00:26:36,567
Pelvic artery was severed.

00:26:36,634 --> 00:26:39,103
My theory: surgery one,
they botched.

00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:42,973
Round two, they
repaired her to death.

Isn't this where
you say my P.O.
would be interested

00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:39,016
to know that I'm hustling,
and you ask for a freebie?

I'm actually not interested
in your ass,

00:29:41,085 --> 00:29:42,920
but the person
we're looking for

00:29:42,987 --> 00:29:45,356
is a human butcher who might be.

00:29:46,924 --> 00:29:48,492
I'm listening.

You want Benway.

Benway did my transition,
but something went wrong.

00:30:07,511 --> 00:30:09,714
And now I can't be
a man <i>or</i> a woman.

00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,115
Want to see?

00:30:11,182 --> 00:30:12,383
No. No, that's all right.

00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:13,551
No, it's not
all right.

00:30:13,617 --> 00:30:16,253

my corrective surgery.

Finally, he fitted her

Benway felt so bad,

00:30:24,328 --> 00:30:25,529
he hooked it up for free.

No one's ever seen him.

00:30:34,005 --> 00:30:35,906
He shows up

Jacqui got an AFIS hit

military service.

used to keep

the cavity open during surgery.

00:31:05,569 --> 00:31:08,506
It's only sold in
surgical supply stores.

00:31:08,572 --> 00:31:10,074
And other than
hospitals,

00:31:10,141 --> 00:31:11,776
the only individual
who's purchased one

00:31:11,842 --> 00:31:13,077
in the last year and a half

00:31:13,144 --> 00:31:14,912
in Las Vegas, Nevada,
is Dr. Karl Benway.

00:31:16,847 --> 00:31:18,582
We know the name
of the butcher.

00:31:18,649 --> 00:31:19,750
WILLOWS/BROWN/SIDLE:
Benway.

00:31:22,486 --> 00:31:23,788
Okay.

00:31:23,854 --> 00:31:25,423
What do you
know about him,

00:31:25,489 --> 00:31:27,024
and do we have an address?

00:31:27,091 --> 00:31:29,360
Total dead end-- he's not
registered with the AMA;

00:31:29,427 --> 00:31:30,861
he's not in the DMV database;

00:31:30,928 --> 00:31:33,197
he has no passport issued
in the state of Nevada.

00:31:33,264 --> 00:31:35,933
So we've got a non-doctor
who served in the military

00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,436
who doesn't drive
and never leaves the country.

00:31:38,502 --> 00:31:40,504
SANDERS:
Sara, you asked for some...

00:31:40,571 --> 00:31:41,706
research.

00:31:41,772 --> 00:31:44,442
Microfiche. Medical journals.

00:31:44,508 --> 00:31:45,710
The stacks.

00:31:45,776 --> 00:31:46,811
There's not a lot
on this guy,

00:31:46,877 --> 00:31:48,312
but this is what
I've been able to find.

00:31:48,379 --> 00:31:51,148
Vietnam vet-- served as a medic.

00:31:51,215 --> 00:31:52,883
Then it looks like
he did a short stint

00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:54,852
with the Sanctuary Alliance
in Ghana.

00:31:54,919 --> 00:31:57,555
He goes from Ghana to Mexico,
where he's arrested

00:31:57,621 --> 00:32:00,157
and deported for performing
illegal abortions.

00:32:00,224 --> 00:32:01,759
SIDLE:
Was his medical license revoked?

00:32:01,826 --> 00:32:02,827
SANDERS:
No.

00:32:02,893 --> 00:32:05,029
Benway never went
to medical school.

00:32:05,096 --> 00:32:06,564
In 1983, he was arrested

00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:08,466
for protesting
outside the Supreme Court.

00:32:08,532 --> 00:32:11,569
1987, <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>
<i>article.</i>

00:32:11,635 --> 00:32:14,005
He was interviewed
at an anti-nuke rally.

00:32:14,071 --> 00:32:16,173
And photographed.

00:32:17,241 --> 00:32:19,577
Know what?

00:32:19,643 --> 00:32:22,413
I believe Dr. Lavalle...

00:32:23,792 --> 00:32:25,360
<i>...is</i> Dr. Benway.

00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:29,166
Boy, you must get
pretty jet-lagged

00:32:29,166 --> 00:32:30,667
flying back and forth
to Bulgaria.

00:32:32,208 --> 00:32:35,978
Or is it Romania... Karl?

00:32:38,214 --> 00:32:41,000
I haven't been Karl Benway
for a very long time.

00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,102
BRASS:
Yeah, like three days ago,
when you killed

00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:44,670
Vern Saldusky at the E-Z Access

00:32:44,737 --> 00:32:45,872
storage unit?

00:32:45,938 --> 00:32:48,834
That's a hell of a place
for an operating room.

00:32:49,291 --> 00:32:50,959
I mean, why not go all the way

00:32:50,959 --> 00:32:52,709
and use the men's room
at the bus station?

00:32:54,458 --> 00:32:56,041
We found your fingerprint there.

00:32:56,041 --> 00:32:57,643
I never said I wasn't there.

00:32:57,709 --> 00:32:59,244
I attended Vern's surgery.

00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:01,847
He was... terrified.

00:33:02,667 --> 00:33:03,935
I tried to calm him.

00:33:04,001 --> 00:33:05,736
BRASS:
Can't get any calmer

00:33:05,803 --> 00:33:06,971
than dead.

00:33:07,038 --> 00:33:08,973
I'm a counselor.

00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,442
( <i>sighs</i> ):
Is that how
your fingerprint

00:33:11,509 --> 00:33:15,146
ended up on
a three-day-old vagina?

00:33:15,212 --> 00:33:16,414
Counseling?

00:33:21,185 --> 00:33:23,487
I've devoted my life

00:33:23,554 --> 00:33:26,057
to helping those who are
cast out by gender prejudice.

00:33:26,123 --> 00:33:28,059
Where would these souls be
without me?

00:33:28,125 --> 00:33:29,894
Who will stand in judgment?

00:33:29,961 --> 00:33:31,996
As to who's a candidate
and who's not.

00:33:32,063 --> 00:33:33,598
Dr. Mercer?

00:33:33,664 --> 00:33:35,433
I was the only one

00:33:35,499 --> 00:33:37,401
willing to help them.

00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:43,341
I was 19 in the rice
paddies of Vietnam...

00:33:43,407 --> 00:33:46,377
sewing legs back on grunts.

00:33:46,444 --> 00:33:49,847
I performed abortions
in Mexico...

00:33:49,914 --> 00:33:53,017
on rape victims when the church
turned its back on them.

00:33:53,084 --> 00:33:55,052
I have been doing gender
reassignment surgery

00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:56,120
for ten years.

00:33:56,187 --> 00:33:58,256
You've been performing surgeries

00:33:58,322 --> 00:34:00,725
without a medical degree...

00:34:00,791 --> 00:34:02,326
Doctor.

00:34:04,595 --> 00:34:06,030
How many Verns have there been?

00:34:07,598 --> 00:34:09,901
How many Wendys?

00:34:16,073 --> 00:34:19,076
Vern was an
unfortunate tragedy.

00:34:19,143 --> 00:34:23,047
I have no idea
what happened to Wendy.

00:34:23,114 --> 00:34:24,715
She saw you with Vern.

00:34:24,782 --> 00:34:27,418
So you killed her,
so she wouldn't expose you.

00:34:27,485 --> 00:34:30,054
That's impossible.

00:34:30,121 --> 00:34:32,189
After I saw Wendy
at the clinic,

00:34:32,256 --> 00:34:36,260
I went straight
to my daughter's soccer game.

00:34:36,327 --> 00:34:38,262
I have nothing more to say.

00:34:38,329 --> 00:34:41,933
We need you to say "ahh."

00:34:43,968 --> 00:34:46,437
So, I heard Brass
arrested Dr. Lavalle,

00:34:46,504 --> 00:34:48,539
who is really
Dr. Benway?
Mm-hmm.

00:34:48,606 --> 00:34:50,641
Which means her
DNA is male.
Right.

00:34:50,708 --> 00:34:54,445
In one of the latex gloves
at the storage facility,
I found female DNA.

00:34:54,512 --> 00:34:57,148
Well, Vern was a male,
and Dr. Lavalle was a male.

00:34:57,215 --> 00:34:59,817
So the doctor had help.

00:35:02,587 --> 00:35:03,888
MAN:
This is ridic...

00:35:03,955 --> 00:35:05,756
What you have
done to my wife
is disgraceful!

00:35:05,823 --> 00:35:08,092
You're not gonna find
anything here!

00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:09,727
Officer, could you
escort this man outside.

00:35:09,794 --> 00:35:10,761
This is
discrimination.

00:35:10,828 --> 00:35:12,496
We are normal people,

00:35:12,563 --> 00:35:15,099
trying to live a normal life.

00:35:15,166 --> 00:35:19,870
I think we have
a spitter, my friend.

00:35:19,937 --> 00:35:22,073
Really?
Yeah.

00:35:24,542 --> 00:35:26,611
BROWN:
I'll check the back.

00:35:26,677 --> 00:35:29,080
All right.

00:36:00,011 --> 00:36:01,479
FRANCIS:
Take her home!

00:36:01,545 --> 00:36:05,416
Would you... just
get her out of here!

00:36:05,483 --> 00:36:07,518
Can I take care of
my daughter, please?

00:36:08,753 --> 00:36:10,421
AMBER:
Francis,

00:36:10,488 --> 00:36:13,090
what is going on?
Daddy, what's
going on?

00:36:13,157 --> 00:36:15,092
It's okay, honey.
Amber's gonna take you home.

00:36:15,159 --> 00:36:16,594
I want to go with you.
Where's Mommy?
I know.

00:36:16,661 --> 00:36:17,628
Mommy's gonna be right back.

00:36:17,695 --> 00:36:18,763
AMBER:
I can't take her.

00:36:18,829 --> 00:36:19,964
I have the night shift

00:36:20,031 --> 00:36:20,998
at the hospital. Fr...

00:36:21,065 --> 00:36:22,400
She shouldn't be
seeing this.

00:36:22,466 --> 00:36:23,534
She's your kid, too.

00:36:23,601 --> 00:36:25,136
Take some
responsibility.
Okay, fine.

00:36:25,202 --> 00:36:26,404
Good.

00:36:27,438 --> 00:36:29,106
AMBER:
Put your belt on.

00:36:29,173 --> 00:36:31,976
Come on, can you pull it?

00:36:37,949 --> 00:36:40,751
( <i>car engine starts</i> )

00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:44,555
I don't understand why I'm here.

00:36:44,622 --> 00:36:46,958
STOKES:
Well, you're here
because I compared

00:36:47,024 --> 00:36:49,060
your DNA from
this cigarette butt

00:36:49,126 --> 00:36:52,330
to sweat recovered
from the inside
of a latex glove

00:36:52,396 --> 00:36:53,764
at the crime scene.

00:36:55,566 --> 00:36:57,735
( <i>beeping</i> )
Busted artery!

00:36:57,802 --> 00:37:00,104
( <i>steady beep tone</i> )

00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:04,775
Ms. Hamshaw...

00:37:04,842 --> 00:37:07,712
Dr. Lavalle was performing
illegal surgeries,

00:37:07,778 --> 00:37:09,814
and you were assisting.

00:37:09,881 --> 00:37:12,250
Now, why would you be involved
with something like that?

00:37:12,316 --> 00:37:16,187
Mona and Francis helped me
clean up.

00:37:16,254 --> 00:37:19,423
They gave me money to be
a surrogate mom for Tippi

00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:21,325
and got me my RN degree.

00:37:21,392 --> 00:37:23,861
They're family.

00:37:23,928 --> 00:37:28,933
So Tippi has two dads
and one mom?

00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,103
Actually,
it's two moms and a dad.

00:37:32,169 --> 00:37:35,072
Okay, tell me
about Wendy Garner.

00:37:35,139 --> 00:37:39,210
Her procedure was
completely successful.

00:37:39,277 --> 00:37:41,379
Well, right up
till her death.

00:37:41,445 --> 00:37:43,548
I had nothing to do with that.

00:37:43,614 --> 00:37:46,450
I was at Tippi's soccer game
with Mona.

00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:34,250
WOMAN 1:
Okay, now what's next?

00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:36,452
WOMAN 2:
I don't know.
We've got Belle.

00:38:37,654 --> 00:38:38,922
Belle.

00:38:38,988 --> 00:38:40,256
Belle.

00:38:40,323 --> 00:38:42,659
That's so sweet...

00:38:42,725 --> 00:38:44,327
( <i>groaning</i> )

00:38:44,394 --> 00:38:47,397
God, what is this?

00:38:47,463 --> 00:38:49,098
How could you do this?

00:38:49,165 --> 00:38:51,067
I just wanted you to keep

00:38:51,134 --> 00:38:53,269
my secret from Aaron, not this.

00:38:53,336 --> 00:38:54,637
I trusted you.

00:38:54,704 --> 00:38:57,106
How could you just
leave her like this?

00:39:04,113 --> 00:39:06,583
I mean, this day means
so much to me.

00:39:06,649 --> 00:39:08,851
And to have
girlfriends like you,

00:39:08,918 --> 00:39:10,186
it's just amazing.

00:39:10,253 --> 00:39:12,021
30 seconds
of mutilation

00:39:12,088 --> 00:39:14,190
recorded over a bridal shower.

00:39:14,257 --> 00:39:16,893
She told her best friend
and Officer Mann

00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,962
that she had some videos
to show.

00:39:19,028 --> 00:39:23,900
I think she must have been
trying to expose Lavalle.

00:39:23,967 --> 00:39:26,502
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

00:39:28,071 --> 00:39:29,872
Brown.

00:39:29,939 --> 00:39:31,341
Really?

00:39:32,375 --> 00:39:34,244
Thanks.

00:39:35,378 --> 00:39:36,746
That was Brass.

00:39:36,813 --> 00:39:40,216
Ten soccer moms confirm they saw
Dr. Lavalle and Amber Hamshaw

00:39:40,283 --> 00:39:42,819
at the soccer game
the night Wendy was killed.

00:39:42,885 --> 00:39:44,787
Another dead end.

00:39:44,854 --> 00:39:47,624
Those fingerprints on the
videotape you recovered?

00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:49,392
We got a match.

00:39:49,459 --> 00:39:51,661
WILLOWS:
Wendy's videotape...

00:39:51,728 --> 00:39:53,496
your fingerprint.

00:39:53,563 --> 00:39:56,132
Doctor, help me
understand something.

00:39:56,199 --> 00:39:58,735
Wendy videotaped
the storage area,

00:39:58,801 --> 00:40:02,505
threatening to expose your
wife's "good work"

00:40:02,572 --> 00:40:04,474
because your wife
was threatening

00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:06,242
to tell Wendy's
fiancee that

00:40:06,309 --> 00:40:08,611
she's not what
she appears to be.

00:40:11,748 --> 00:40:14,150
But the three of you were
still getting it on.

00:40:14,217 --> 00:40:15,351
I beg your pardon?

00:40:15,418 --> 00:40:16,452
Based on

00:40:16,519 --> 00:40:19,422
the DNA that we found
in Wendy's cheek,

00:40:19,489 --> 00:40:22,158
you were swapping spit with her,

00:40:22,225 --> 00:40:23,927
and your wife was swapping

00:40:23,993 --> 00:40:25,528
something else
with her.

00:40:25,595 --> 00:40:28,364
Now we know
that post-ops
can't ejaculate.

00:40:28,431 --> 00:40:31,534
So the only way I can explain
the semen in Wendy's mouth

00:40:31,601 --> 00:40:33,269
is your wife is still packing.

00:40:33,336 --> 00:40:36,139
Yes, and I performed fellatio
on my wife...

00:40:36,205 --> 00:40:37,674
after lunch.

00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,342
Is that a crime?

00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:43,479
I have no idea how anything
got into Wendy's mouth.

00:40:43,546 --> 00:40:44,981
My wife and I did not cheat.

00:40:46,583 --> 00:40:47,884
You don't get it, do you?

00:40:47,951 --> 00:40:49,886
Because we're different.

00:40:49,953 --> 00:40:52,221
We still love.

00:40:53,489 --> 00:40:55,291
We still honor.

00:40:55,358 --> 00:40:57,694
Is that why you hacked out
Wendy's Adam's apple?

00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,728
Love and honor?

00:40:58,795 --> 00:41:00,630
You went back

00:41:00,697 --> 00:41:02,899
to the storage area
to get rid of Vern's body.

00:41:02,966 --> 00:41:04,100
You saw Wendy leaving.

00:41:17,046 --> 00:41:21,050
WENDY:
<i>Mimosa, look, it's me.</i>

00:41:22,125 --> 00:41:23,293
I need your help, okay?

00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,862
I have these videos
and I have to show you them.

00:41:25,929 --> 00:41:28,265
You're never going to believe
what's on them.

00:41:28,332 --> 00:41:29,466
These people...

00:41:29,533 --> 00:41:32,002
( <i>tires squealing</i>
<i>and horns honking</i> )

00:41:34,471 --> 00:41:36,907
( <i>yelling</i> )

00:41:36,974 --> 00:41:38,475
How dare you?!

00:41:38,542 --> 00:41:40,043
( <i>both talking at once</i> )

00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:41,311
( <i>screaming</i> )

00:41:49,709 --> 00:41:53,112
I tried to protect
my wife's work.

00:41:53,179 --> 00:41:55,348
Not just for us.

00:41:55,414 --> 00:41:58,317
For all the people like us.

00:42:00,353 --> 00:42:02,788
So the man admits to murder
but not infidelity.

00:42:02,855 --> 00:42:04,590
Well, maybe he
wasn't unfaithful.

00:42:04,657 --> 00:42:06,525
You know, I read
a paper in the JFS

00:42:06,592 --> 00:42:09,061
documenting a case where
a woman kissed a man,

00:42:09,128 --> 00:42:10,083
who had smoked
a cigarette.

00:42:10,083 --> 00:42:11,851
When they tested
the cigarette butt,

00:42:11,918 --> 00:42:13,486
they found both
their DNA on it.

00:42:13,583 --> 00:42:15,184
So you're saying
it was transfer?

00:42:15,917 --> 00:42:17,852
Well, if Francis gave
his wife fellatio

00:42:17,919 --> 00:42:19,454
shortly before he killed Wendy,

00:42:19,521 --> 00:42:21,289
it's possible that some
of the semen

00:42:21,356 --> 00:42:22,490
was still in his mouth,

00:42:22,557 --> 00:42:24,993
and it got transferred
onto her through his spit.

00:42:29,097 --> 00:42:30,765
Right.

00:42:30,832 --> 00:42:32,334
Don't you think?

00:42:33,568 --> 00:42:37,272
I thought you'd want to know
what happened to Wendy.

00:42:37,339 --> 00:42:39,708
I appreciate
your telling me.

00:42:39,774 --> 00:42:42,877
Killed by someone in
our own community.

00:42:42,944 --> 00:42:45,814
As if we don't have
enough enemies.

00:42:48,583 --> 00:42:51,519
Her parents never
understood her,

00:42:51,586 --> 00:42:54,756
but still I think
they should know.

00:42:54,823 --> 00:42:57,092
What do I say?

00:43:00,792 --> 00:43:02,461
Show them an oyster.

00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:04,196
I'm sorry?

00:43:04,263 --> 00:43:06,031
There are two types
of male oysters,

00:43:06,098 --> 00:43:10,369
and one of them can change
genders at will.

00:43:10,435 --> 00:43:12,771
And before man crawled
out of the muck,

00:43:12,838 --> 00:43:14,640
maybe he had the same option.

00:43:14,706 --> 00:43:17,309
Maybe originally

00:43:17,376 --> 00:43:19,511
we were supposed to be able
to switch genders,

00:43:20,125 --> 00:43:25,834
and being born with just one
sex... is a mutation.
