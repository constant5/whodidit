00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,516
Yeah, wide receiver for
the Vegas Greenbacks, right?

00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:08,283
Right.

00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:09,418
Well, his team ring

00:11:09,484 --> 00:11:10,953
was on this guy's finger.

00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:12,955
Yeah, then you mis-ID'd the vic.

00:11:13,021 --> 00:11:14,590
Gabe Miller's still alive.

00:11:14,656 --> 00:11:17,426
As much as a politician can be.

00:11:18,493 --> 00:11:20,696
BRASS:
<i>So, this is your ring, huh?</i>

00:11:20,762 --> 00:11:23,565
Yeah, that's my old number.

00:11:23,632 --> 00:11:25,601
Haven't seen that ring
in a long time.

00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:27,603
Why is that?

00:11:27,669 --> 00:11:30,205
Every cent I earned playing ball
went up my nose

00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:33,208
or on some dog
at Las Vegas Downs.

00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:34,876
I was a real mess

00:11:34,943 --> 00:11:37,646
until I accepted Jesus Christ
as my personal savior.

00:11:40,115 --> 00:11:41,817
Do you got a problem
with that, Captain?

00:11:41,884 --> 00:11:43,352
No. No, no. No, I...

00:11:43,418 --> 00:11:45,220
No, I'm just listening.

00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:46,822
Well, there's no need
to keep talking

00:11:46,889 --> 00:11:48,824
unless you're gonna speak
your mind.

00:11:48,891 --> 00:11:50,525
Okay, Councilman.

00:11:50,592 --> 00:11:51,793
Say you're an alcoholic.

00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:54,129
One day you decide
to give up the bottle.

00:11:54,196 --> 00:11:55,130
And, more often than not,

00:11:55,197 --> 00:11:56,398
you're gonna trade
in the shot glass

00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:57,466
for a dozen Krispy Kremes

00:11:57,532 --> 00:11:58,967
and start pounding them
away with both hands.

00:11:59,034 --> 00:12:00,135
You know what I mean?

00:12:00,202 --> 00:12:02,137
So you think
I'm an addictive personality.

00:12:02,204 --> 00:12:04,273
Only now I'm into God
instead of greyhounds?

00:12:04,339 --> 00:12:06,475
No. I-I'm really not making
any judgments.

00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:08,343
When the Lord cleaned up
my life,

00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:10,479
I promised Him
I'd always remember the man

00:12:10,545 --> 00:12:12,547
that I used to be,
so I'd never be that man again.

00:12:12,614 --> 00:12:15,417
I dedicated 20 years
of my life to playing football.

00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:19,421
And I pawned
my championship ring

00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:21,023
for a $50 parlay.

00:12:21,089 --> 00:12:22,457
Sir, they're ready
for you now.

00:12:22,524 --> 00:12:23,083
Okay.

00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:24,542
You can file a claim
at our office

00:12:24,542 --> 00:12:26,610

ring back any
time you want.

00:12:26,677 --> 00:12:28,145
I don't need trophies
anymore, Captain.

00:12:28,212 --> 00:12:29,814
Good luck on your case.

The Vegas Sports Line.
Yeah,

00:16:40,047 --> 00:16:41,482

in Vegas.

00:16:43,017 --> 00:16:44,485
Now, if the vic worked

Oh, so,

00:17:51,785 --> 00:17:53,220
he wasn't the favorite?

00:17:53,287 --> 00:17:55,389

Yeah, well, I guess
the guys didn't think

he deserved
to be cocky just yet.

00:18:02,463 --> 00:18:03,931

00:18:30,691 --> 00:18:33,360
How'd that game turn out?

00:18:33,427 --> 00:18:35,496
( <i>laughing</i> )

00:18:38,132 --> 00:18:40,000
Just like I called it, old man!

00:18:40,067 --> 00:18:41,635
Hey, you weren't even close!

00:18:41,702 --> 00:18:42,937
Then he left.

00:18:43,003 --> 00:18:44,772
That was the last time
I saw him.

00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,709
Hi. Can I leave this message
for Melody?

00:18:50,411 --> 00:18:52,079
Hi.

00:18:52,146 --> 00:18:53,514
I'm from the Crime Lab.

00:18:53,581 --> 00:18:57,585
There's potential evidence
on this board.

00:18:57,651 --> 00:19:00,788
I need the messages
for Maurice Hudson.

00:19:00,855 --> 00:19:03,190
Crime Lab?

00:19:04,425 --> 00:19:06,160
Something happen to him?

00:19:07,895 --> 00:19:09,763
Yes.

00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:10,831
He's dead.

00:19:10,898 --> 00:19:11,832
Oh.

00:19:11,899 --> 00:19:12,967
A few ladies

00:19:13,033 --> 00:19:14,602
here are going
to be in mourning.

00:19:14,668 --> 00:19:16,403
He was popular.

00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:17,905
Don't know why.

00:19:17,972 --> 00:19:19,507
Guess some people like pigs.

00:19:19,573 --> 00:19:21,175
I take it you knew him.

00:19:21,242 --> 00:19:22,576
Well enough
to keep my distance.

00:19:22,643 --> 00:19:23,911
Bastard liked doing fat girls,

00:19:23,978 --> 00:19:25,546
but didn't want
to be seen with them.

00:19:25,613 --> 00:19:27,348
There are some women
around here who spend

00:19:27,414 --> 00:19:28,916
all their time and energy
giving pleasure

00:19:28,983 --> 00:19:30,384
because they think
they aren't worthy.

00:19:30,451 --> 00:19:33,020
You don't have to be large
to have low self-esteem.

00:19:34,021 --> 00:19:35,456
Did he check his messages
last night?

00:19:35,523 --> 00:19:36,624
Yeah.

00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:39,326
He and Regina Owens
played message tag for a while.

00:19:39,393 --> 00:19:40,728
I figured they hooked up.

00:19:40,794 --> 00:19:42,029
Where can I find her?

00:19:42,096 --> 00:19:43,330
She's a vendor.

00:19:43,397 --> 00:19:44,732
Intimates.

00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:55,910
That's some tickler
you got there.

00:19:55,976 --> 00:19:57,311
Excuse me?

00:19:57,378 --> 00:19:59,580
You got everything you
need to please a woman.

00:19:59,647 --> 00:20:02,049
Fine.

00:20:02,116 --> 00:20:03,250
Regina,

00:20:03,317 --> 00:20:08,722
um, can I ask you,
is this silk or synthetic?

00:20:08,789 --> 00:20:10,558
Oh, that's 100% silk.

00:20:10,624 --> 00:20:12,426
How many sets of these
have you sold?

00:20:12,493 --> 00:20:15,529
Four pre-orders and
another 15 commissions.

00:20:15,596 --> 00:20:17,398
I even made a
set for myself.

00:20:19,466 --> 00:20:21,268
Men love purple.

00:20:21,335 --> 00:20:22,703
Do they?

00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:24,505
It's Purple Rain.

00:20:24,572 --> 00:20:26,106
Prince. Sexy.

00:20:26,173 --> 00:20:27,575
Custom color.

00:20:27,641 --> 00:20:29,410
You want it
for the wife?

00:20:29,476 --> 00:20:30,678
I'm not married.

00:20:30,744 --> 00:20:31,846
Girlfriend?

00:20:31,912 --> 00:20:33,013
No.

00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,181
You want one?

00:20:34,248 --> 00:20:35,382
Yes, I do.

00:20:35,449 --> 00:20:36,684
( <i>laughs</i> )

00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:39,954
I'd also like, uh, copies
of your customer receipts.

00:20:50,531 --> 00:20:51,765
Yeah, this is the guy.

00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:54,944
Time-stamps match
what were on the tickets.

00:20:56,746 --> 00:20:58,041
Looks like a runner to me.

00:20:58,041 --> 00:20:59,208
WOMAN:
Got that right.

00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:00,476
Name's Lou Barnes.

00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:03,377
Yeah, we were kind of hoping
those babies wouldn't show up.

00:21:03,444 --> 00:21:04,712
Why, because they're winners?

00:21:04,779 --> 00:21:06,614
Oh, yeah.
Those little pieces of paper

00:21:06,681 --> 00:21:08,316
are worth ten-five each.

00:21:08,382 --> 00:21:09,350
Game hit us hard.

00:21:09,417 --> 00:21:11,385
Yeah, I hear that
book's the only place

00:21:11,452 --> 00:21:13,154
where casinos
actually lose money.

00:21:13,221 --> 00:21:15,489
I worked here a long time,
never seen anything like it.

00:21:15,556 --> 00:21:16,857
Not even ASU-Washington in '93.

00:21:16,924 --> 00:21:17,992
Oh, that's when

00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:19,493
the players shaved points.

00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,462
Any indication
that this game was fixed?

00:21:21,529 --> 00:21:23,297
Well, gaming commission
investigated.

00:21:23,364 --> 00:21:24,799
They didn't think so.
I figure

00:21:24,865 --> 00:21:26,801
we just got caught
in a good steam play.

00:21:26,867 --> 00:21:28,069
A lot of one-way action?

00:21:28,135 --> 00:21:29,537
Minute VSL opened the line.

00:21:29,604 --> 00:21:31,739
Yeah, it was weird.

00:21:31,806 --> 00:21:33,674
Those guys are usually
right on.

00:21:33,741 --> 00:21:35,876
I mean, that's what
we pay them for.

00:21:35,943 --> 00:21:39,013
The sharp number keeps you guys
from getting hit too hard, huh?

00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,414
Not this time.

00:21:40,481 --> 00:21:41,515
Number went all over the place.

00:21:41,582 --> 00:21:42,550
Money was rolling in so fast,

00:21:42,617 --> 00:21:44,819
guys were fighting
for position in line.

00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:46,888
We lost over a million
on that game.

00:21:46,954 --> 00:21:49,891
Could I get a printout
of the line moves?

00:21:49,957 --> 00:21:51,626
You got it.

00:22:15,249 --> 00:22:16,751
Hey.

00:22:16,817 --> 00:22:18,052
Hey.

00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:22,023
So, uh, Brass got a home address
on the runner, Lou Barnes.

00:22:22,089 --> 00:22:23,491
He's looking into it.

00:22:23,558 --> 00:22:25,126
What are you still doing here
anyway?

00:22:25,192 --> 00:22:28,496
I'm studying the game
that our vic got rich on.

00:22:28,563 --> 00:22:32,066
These are the craziest
line moves I've ever seen.

00:22:32,133 --> 00:22:33,467
Line moves?

00:22:33,534 --> 00:22:34,735
Got to say, the only thing

00:22:34,802 --> 00:22:38,072
that sports book means to me
is guys without showers.

00:22:38,139 --> 00:22:39,073
( <i>laughs</i> )

00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,241
That's actually true.

00:22:40,308 --> 00:22:41,976
Yeah, I know.
Okay, well,

00:22:42,043 --> 00:22:44,345
let me see
if I can break it down.

00:22:44,412 --> 00:22:45,580
Monday morning,

00:22:45,646 --> 00:22:48,049
the week of the
Duke-Louisville game,

00:22:48,115 --> 00:22:52,920
VSL sets the line
at Duke minus 15.

00:22:52,987 --> 00:22:55,256
So if I were to place a bet
on Duke,

00:22:55,323 --> 00:22:57,725
they would have to win
by more than 15

00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:59,827
in order for me to win the bet.

00:22:59,894 --> 00:23:02,129
Right. Now according
to the manager of the book,

00:23:02,196 --> 00:23:03,598
the moment that
number went up,

00:23:03,664 --> 00:23:05,333
cash came rolling in on Duke.

00:23:05,399 --> 00:23:08,569
<i>The professional bettors</i>
<i>were all over the number,</i>

00:23:08,636 --> 00:23:10,771
<i>dispatching runners</i>
<i>in every book in town.</i>

00:23:10,838 --> 00:23:13,291
<i>Now, remember,</i>
<i>money moves the line.</i>

00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:14,726
<i>So, by the middle of the week,</i>

00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:16,795
<i>the tourists and local suckers</i>
<i>caught wind</i>

00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:19,264
<i>of what the pros were betting,</i>
<i>pumping the line</i>

00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:20,899
<i>to Duke minus 25.</i>

00:23:21,834 --> 00:23:23,469
Yeah, everybody's throwing money
on Duke.

00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:24,470
Big favorite.

00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:25,792
This is where it gets weird.

00:23:25,792 --> 00:23:28,361
By Friday, all sorts of cash
starts rolling in,

00:23:28,428 --> 00:23:31,230
but this time on the underdog--
Louisville plus 25.

00:23:31,297 --> 00:23:35,468
Which means that Louisville
could lose by 24

00:23:35,535 --> 00:23:37,737
and still win the bet.

00:23:39,205 --> 00:23:40,640
So, why
would you bet on the underdog

00:23:40,707 --> 00:23:42,542
if you had already put money
on the favorite?

00:23:42,609 --> 00:23:44,744
Well, here's why.

00:23:44,811 --> 00:23:47,814
Our vic had Lou Barnes
lay 17 points

00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,248
with Duke,

00:23:49,315 --> 00:23:52,051
and take 23 with Louisville.

00:23:52,118 --> 00:23:54,754
And the game...

00:23:54,821 --> 00:23:55,922
landed 22.

00:23:55,989 --> 00:23:57,257
How do you think he did it?

00:23:57,323 --> 00:24:01,861
WILLOWS:
He got more than 17
and less than 23.

00:24:01,928 --> 00:24:04,063
He won both bets.

00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:06,099
All that action
created this big "middle,"

00:24:06,165 --> 00:24:07,166
so he was able to win

00:24:07,233 --> 00:24:09,102
on both sides.

00:24:09,168 --> 00:24:11,838
I think Kelvin Russell
sold VSL's numbers,

00:24:11,904 --> 00:24:13,373
and got killed for it.

00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:16,743
BRASS:
Lou Barnes.

00:24:16,809 --> 00:24:19,045
Big money runner.

00:24:19,112 --> 00:24:22,015
Still living
at your mom's house?

00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:25,453
Hey, buddy, focus.

00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,388
You all right?

00:24:31,058 --> 00:24:32,527
Guess not.

00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:41,834
Okay, Ma'am.
What've you got for us?

00:24:41,834 --> 00:24:43,625
Pulled this out
of his calf.

00:24:43,625 --> 00:24:44,893
Been in there
at least a week.

00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,028
The guy was septic.

00:24:46,095 --> 00:24:47,125
He's lucky to be alive.

00:24:47,125 --> 00:24:49,094
( <i>groans softly</i> )

00:24:49,161 --> 00:24:50,562
Number four buckshot.

00:24:50,629 --> 00:24:53,465
Barnes was at Rainbow Canyon
with Russell.

00:24:53,532 --> 00:24:55,500
Russell knows the line's going
to move on a big game,

00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,802
and he wants to cash in on it.

00:24:56,868 --> 00:24:59,071
But he can't go near a book
without being reported,

00:24:59,137 --> 00:25:00,706
so he hires Barnes
to place the bets.

00:25:00,772 --> 00:25:03,642
They win big, and both wind up
on the wrong end of a shotgun.

00:25:03,709 --> 00:25:04,843
( <i>gunshot</i> )

00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:06,845
( <i>man yelling</i> )
( <i>gun cocking</i> )

00:25:11,717 --> 00:25:13,719
( <i>gunshot</i> )

00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,130
We're looking
for a third guy.

00:25:26,465 --> 00:25:28,400
Hey, Lou. Lou.

00:25:28,467 --> 00:25:30,068
You want to tell us

00:25:30,135 --> 00:25:31,603
who filled you full of lead?

00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:34,773
I want a lawyer.

00:25:44,916 --> 00:25:45,951
METCALF:
Walk softly.

00:25:46,017 --> 00:25:48,120
Don't cause a stampede.

00:25:48,186 --> 00:25:50,756
I am going to remember
that you said that, Metcalf,

00:25:50,822 --> 00:25:53,492
especially after these ladies
sue you and the police

00:25:53,558 --> 00:25:55,160
for discrimination, you genius.

00:25:55,227 --> 00:25:57,496
Could you clear the
halls for me, please?

00:25:57,562 --> 00:25:59,898
Come on, guys.

00:26:01,233 --> 00:26:02,501
Hi, there.

00:26:02,567 --> 00:26:04,469
I'm Sara Sidle; I'm
with the Crime Lab.

00:26:04,536 --> 00:26:05,804
I would like to apologize
for him.

00:26:05,871 --> 00:26:06,972
That was really out of line.

00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:08,373
They all were,
and so are you,

00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,075
unless you've got
a good explanation

00:26:10,142 --> 00:26:12,344
on why we've been hauled
down here.

00:26:12,411 --> 00:26:15,380
Well, as you know, this
is a homicide investigation.

00:26:15,447 --> 00:26:16,815
We've recovered evidence

00:26:16,882 --> 00:26:18,917
consistent
with custom-made lingerie

00:26:18,984 --> 00:26:20,152
that all of you own.

00:26:20,218 --> 00:26:21,486
JILL:
I'm no lawyer,

00:26:21,553 --> 00:26:23,121
but that sounds flimsy,
even to me.

00:26:23,188 --> 00:26:24,656
We also ran DNA on evidence

00:26:24,723 --> 00:26:27,125
that we found at the crime scene
that proves

00:26:27,192 --> 00:26:29,995
that two women had
sex with the victim
prior to his death.

00:26:30,062 --> 00:26:32,364
I would like to rule you out
as suspects,

00:26:32,431 --> 00:26:34,800
so I'm asking
for a voluntary DNA sample.

00:26:34,866 --> 00:26:36,368
You think one of us
killed Maurice?

00:26:36,435 --> 00:26:37,436
Who's Maurice?

00:26:37,502 --> 00:26:39,271
You know, Maurice Hudson.

00:26:39,337 --> 00:26:40,839
Big ego, little scab.

00:26:40,906 --> 00:26:43,842
If I could just swab
the inside of your cheek.

00:26:43,909 --> 00:26:45,043
The answer is no.

00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:47,379
I can easily get a court order
with what I've got.

00:26:47,446 --> 00:26:49,047
So, get one.

00:26:49,114 --> 00:26:50,716
Let's go.

00:26:52,384 --> 00:26:53,518
Jill?

00:26:53,585 --> 00:26:54,653
I don't want
this humiliation

00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,421
made more public
than it already is.

00:26:56,488 --> 00:26:58,724
And I definitely
don't want to come back here.

00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:01,126
So, you do what you want,
but this ends

00:27:01,193 --> 00:27:02,828
for me right here.

00:27:05,897 --> 00:27:08,800
You told us that
you didn't really
know the victim.

00:27:08,867 --> 00:27:10,535
I didn't want
to get involved.

00:27:10,602 --> 00:27:12,003
I still don't.

00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:13,672
You were in his bed.

00:27:13,739 --> 00:27:15,607
I'd call that involved.

00:27:15,674 --> 00:27:18,877
Look... Maurice
wasn't a nice guy,

00:27:18,944 --> 00:27:21,680
but I slept with him anyway.

00:27:21,747 --> 00:27:23,782
I could service him all night,

00:27:23,849 --> 00:27:27,052
and he wouldn't even ride
the elevator with me.

00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:29,721
I bet that hurt.

00:27:29,788 --> 00:27:32,391
Enough to kill him?

00:27:32,457 --> 00:27:34,860
He was better when I left
than when I got there.

00:27:36,595 --> 00:27:37,763
What time was that?

00:27:38,792 --> 00:27:40,794
I went to his room around 7:00.

00:27:40,861 --> 00:27:43,731
Stayed just long enough
to get mine and go.

00:27:43,797 --> 00:27:45,566
( <i>raucous laughter</i> )

00:27:45,632 --> 00:27:47,401
Ooh! Oh!

00:27:47,468 --> 00:27:49,069
( <i>laughter continues</i> )

00:27:54,441 --> 00:27:56,477
He knew how to have fun.

00:27:56,543 --> 00:28:00,547
And that's why we all come
to Vegas, isn't it?

00:28:01,915 --> 00:28:05,119
I'm fat, Ms. Sidle.

00:28:05,185 --> 00:28:06,820
I am a fat woman.

00:28:06,887 --> 00:28:11,692
I've tried diet after diet,
joined gym after gym,

00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:16,709
done obesity programs,
obsessed about drastic surgery,

00:28:16,709 --> 00:28:18,477
and I'm still fat.

00:28:18,544 --> 00:28:20,500
I didn't get
my high school crush.

00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,834
I did his homework.

00:28:21,901 --> 00:28:24,604
Didn't get the one
in college, either.

00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:27,640
He became my "friend."

00:28:27,707 --> 00:28:34,380
But Maurice left a note
in my slot on the message wall.

00:28:34,447 --> 00:28:40,153
And he made me feel special...

00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:42,955
sexy...

00:28:43,022 --> 00:28:44,857
wanted.

00:28:45,667 --> 00:28:49,437
Did you know
about the other woman?

00:28:49,504 --> 00:28:53,041
When I went up to his room,
she was leaving.

00:28:53,108 --> 00:28:56,778
And you slept
with him anyway?

00:28:56,845 --> 00:28:59,047
I thought about turning around,

00:28:59,114 --> 00:29:02,217
but it's not
like I've had a lot of chances.

00:29:02,284 --> 00:29:06,821
It wasn't till afterwards...

00:29:06,888 --> 00:29:10,492
that I started to feel... angry.

00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,494
At myself.

00:29:12,561 --> 00:29:16,097
For letting him take advantage
of me.

00:29:16,164 --> 00:29:18,099
Did you argue with him?

00:29:18,166 --> 00:29:19,668
Was there a fight?

00:29:19,734 --> 00:29:23,038
No.

00:29:23,104 --> 00:29:25,974
I waited for him to fall asleep.

00:29:26,041 --> 00:29:28,410
Then I smothered him
with a pillow

00:29:28,476 --> 00:29:31,513
and held him down
until he stopped moving.

00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:37,586
( <i>siren blaring</i> )

00:29:39,321 --> 00:29:40,856
WARRICK:
Across town on a homicide,

00:29:40,922 --> 00:29:43,425
you guys call me out here
for an abandoned vehicle?

00:29:43,491 --> 00:29:45,660
BRASS:
The car was reported stolen
last week.

00:29:45,727 --> 00:29:47,329
The R.O. is Mitch Urbana.

00:29:47,395 --> 00:29:48,897
It's been picked clean.

00:29:48,964 --> 00:29:51,066
You guys popped the trunk?

00:29:51,132 --> 00:29:53,168
Waiting for you;
pop it.

00:30:01,443 --> 00:30:02,625
What do you got?

00:30:02,625 --> 00:30:04,627
Feels like metal.

00:30:11,167 --> 00:30:12,735
BRASS:
The dust in your trunk

00:30:12,802 --> 00:30:15,037
is high carbon steel
mixed with chrome--

00:30:15,667 --> 00:30:17,869
consistent
with a shotgun barrel,

00:30:17,936 --> 00:30:20,972
like the weapon used
to kill Kelvin Russell.

00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:26,077
Look, uh, my car was stolen,
and I reported it, okay?

00:30:26,144 --> 00:30:27,312
End of story.

00:30:27,379 --> 00:30:31,316
I don't know nothing
about no shotgun.

00:30:31,383 --> 00:30:34,085
Maybe the punk who stole my car
must have put it there.

00:30:34,152 --> 00:30:36,554
You and Kelvin
weren't on the best terms, eh?

00:30:36,621 --> 00:30:40,725
Oddsmaking's a little art
and a little science, you know?

00:30:40,792 --> 00:30:43,128
Russell was... he was all mouth.

00:30:43,194 --> 00:30:45,897
Hey, he nailed the Duke game.

00:30:45,964 --> 00:30:47,832
He got lucky.

00:30:47,899 --> 00:30:50,168
You know, there's about 30 games
a day, and...

00:30:50,235 --> 00:30:52,437
Look, let me try to explain it
to you, okay?

00:30:52,504 --> 00:30:54,139
Inside each game

00:30:54,205 --> 00:30:55,473
is a number.

00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:58,543
Once in a while, I'm,
I'm a little off.

00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:01,146
But most of the time, I'm right.

00:31:01,212 --> 00:31:03,515
I work very hard to be right.

00:31:03,582 --> 00:31:06,084
I chisel through stacks
of statistics,

00:31:06,151 --> 00:31:08,253
I sweep away
all the irrelevancies.

00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,521
I try to get to the bottom--

00:31:09,588 --> 00:31:11,122
you know, where the truth is.

00:31:11,189 --> 00:31:13,358
And yeah, I want to know
what the quarterback

00:31:13,425 --> 00:31:14,526
had to eat that day,

00:31:14,593 --> 00:31:16,428
and if the point guard's
going through

00:31:16,494 --> 00:31:17,429
a messy divorce.

00:31:17,495 --> 00:31:18,964
All these things,
they come together,

00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:21,466
and all of a sudden, bang--
a number just jumps out at you.

00:31:21,533 --> 00:31:23,702
And within an hour,

00:31:23,768 --> 00:31:25,804
every sports book in Vegas

00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:28,506
got that number
up on their board.

00:31:28,573 --> 00:31:31,876
My hard work
displayed up there in lights.

00:31:31,943 --> 00:31:33,278
That's what I do.

00:31:33,345 --> 00:31:35,714
Let me tell you what I think.

00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:37,849
Kelvin made you look bad.

00:31:37,916 --> 00:31:42,020
He made you
look stupid.

00:31:42,087 --> 00:31:44,689
And for a guy
who thinks highly of himself,

00:31:44,756 --> 00:31:46,625
who clearly needs to be right,

00:31:46,691 --> 00:31:49,794
where there's a tremendous
amount of ego involved,

00:31:49,861 --> 00:31:51,663
that's motivation for murder.

00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:55,467
Kelvin Russell didn't know
what hard work was, okay?

00:31:55,533 --> 00:31:58,870
He was a loudmouth
major pain in the ass.

00:32:01,406 --> 00:32:02,574
You think I killed him?

00:32:05,477 --> 00:32:07,445
Prove it.

00:32:08,694 --> 00:32:09,729
Brenda Morgan
is claiming that

00:32:09,795 --> 00:32:12,236
she smothered the victim
to death with a pillow.

00:32:12,236 --> 00:32:14,069
He wasn't killed
with a pillow.

00:32:14,069 --> 00:32:15,902
C.O.D. was compressed asphyxia.

00:32:15,902 --> 00:32:18,204
She admits guilt, but
she's hiding something.

00:32:18,271 --> 00:32:20,206
Maybe she's covering
for someone else.

00:32:20,273 --> 00:32:22,042
We know that Regina
Owens was in the room.

00:32:22,108 --> 00:32:23,643
She claims she left
the victim alive,

00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:24,911
and Brenda is
backing her up.

00:32:24,978 --> 00:32:26,246
Yeah, but she's a liar.

00:32:26,312 --> 00:32:29,902
SANDERS:
<i>Brenda got off the elevator</i>
<i>at 7:30.</i>

00:32:29,902 --> 00:32:31,485
Regina got on.

00:32:31,485 --> 00:32:32,820
They knew each other,

00:32:32,886 --> 00:32:35,111
so things must have been
uncomfortable.

00:32:35,111 --> 00:32:36,212
The tape confirms

00:32:36,279 --> 00:32:37,347
Brenda's account.

00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:38,514
What time did she leave?

00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:39,882
Spent the night.

00:32:39,949 --> 00:32:42,185
She didn't leave
till the next morning.

00:32:42,252 --> 00:32:44,687
Doc Robbins ball-parked
the victim's death

00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:46,694
at sometime between 9:00
p.m. and midnight.

00:32:46,694 --> 00:32:48,897
That means she slept
with a dead guy.

00:32:48,963 --> 00:32:51,766
She's not only a killer,
she's a necrophiliac.

00:32:51,833 --> 00:32:53,368
That's what I call
enjoying your work.

00:32:53,434 --> 00:32:54,369
Hold on, hold on.

00:32:54,435 --> 00:32:55,770
Uh, back up the tape, please.

00:32:58,473 --> 00:33:01,009
There. Stop.

00:33:01,075 --> 00:33:03,311
She's trashed.

00:33:03,378 --> 00:33:05,013
Maybe she passed out.

00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:06,648
How drunk
do you have to be

00:33:06,714 --> 00:33:08,883
to sleep next to
a decomposing body?

00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:10,952
The smell alone's
an alarm clock.

00:33:11,019 --> 00:33:13,254
Not next to him.

00:33:13,321 --> 00:33:14,756
On top of him.

00:33:16,424 --> 00:33:17,592
BROWN:
Who do you like?

00:33:17,659 --> 00:33:19,527
WILLOWS:
Uh, Charlotte.

00:33:19,594 --> 00:33:21,095
My mom grew up
in North Carolina.

00:33:21,162 --> 00:33:23,531
All right, I'll give you
Charlotte plus two.

00:33:23,598 --> 00:33:25,133
What do I get if I win?

00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,436
How about a fabulous dinner?

00:33:28,503 --> 00:33:31,005
I'll take your action.

00:33:31,072 --> 00:33:32,207
All right.

00:33:32,273 --> 00:33:34,108
( <i>indistinct voices on TV</i> )

00:33:34,175 --> 00:33:35,477
So, unless we find

00:33:35,543 --> 00:33:36,678
our murder weapon,

00:33:36,744 --> 00:33:39,013
the case against Urbana
is circumstantial at best.

00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,448
But he's involved. I feel it.

00:33:40,515 --> 00:33:43,318
Those sports betting types--
they'll lie to their own kids

00:33:43,384 --> 00:33:45,653
about a game
that hasn't been played yet.

00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,155
You were a sports betting guy.

00:33:47,222 --> 00:33:48,456
Yeah, and I lied when I was.

Charlotte 88.

Charlotte looking
for one last shot.

Final score-- Pistons, 89.

but I still win that bet.

Really?

00:34:11,446 --> 00:34:13,314
Well, thank you.

That was the manager
of the sports book.

filed a lost ticket claim
for the tickets

00:34:20,488 --> 00:34:21,990
that you found
at the Beaver Dam.

00:34:22,056 --> 00:34:24,159
What's the name?

00:34:24,225 --> 00:34:26,060
BROWN:
Cesar Dabo.

00:34:26,127 --> 00:34:27,295
No wants or warrants.

00:34:27,362 --> 00:34:28,830
Address in Lincoln County.

00:34:28,897 --> 00:34:30,231
That's near Rainbow Canyon.

00:34:30,298 --> 00:34:32,033
That's where
you found the body, isn't it?

00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,569
Yeah. Professional
boxer from '79

00:34:34,636 --> 00:34:35,837
to '85.

00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:37,672
After that, he spent a lot

00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:40,141
of time in Vegas
as a bouncer,

00:34:40,208 --> 00:34:41,709
bartender, handyman.

00:34:41,776 --> 00:34:44,612
Just another one of
those broken down,

00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:45,914
punch-drunk bums.

00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:48,516
It says Dabo was a
Welterweight contender.

00:34:48,583 --> 00:34:49,751
A title match

00:34:49,818 --> 00:34:51,920
against Archie Archman
was his biggest fight.

00:34:51,986 --> 00:34:53,421
Lost by a split decision.

00:34:57,358 --> 00:34:59,027
Check this out.

00:34:59,093 --> 00:35:01,196
The only judge
who called the fight for Dabo

00:35:01,262 --> 00:35:03,631
was Mitch Urbana.

00:35:06,434 --> 00:35:09,904
Oh. So maybe Urbana
hired his former boxing buddy

00:35:09,971 --> 00:35:11,473
to do his dirty work.

00:35:11,539 --> 00:35:13,441
Dabo takes them out
to Rainbow Canyon.

00:35:13,508 --> 00:35:15,443
Murders Russell,
but Barnes gets away.

00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:19,113
Dabo grabs most of the cash,
goes back to Russell's body,

00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:21,783
takes the wallet, ID,
takes off his face.

00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:24,052
And Urbana reports
his car stolen to cover his ass.

00:35:24,118 --> 00:35:26,154
Let's put out a broadcast.

00:35:28,723 --> 00:35:30,758
( <i>distant sirens</i> )

00:35:40,468 --> 00:35:42,470
Let's go.

00:35:53,648 --> 00:35:54,149
Las Vegas

00:35:54,215 --> 00:35:55,283
Police.

00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:56,851
Cesar Dabo?

00:35:56,918 --> 00:35:58,286
( <i>sniffing</i> )

00:35:58,353 --> 00:35:59,654
Put your hands on your head.

00:36:01,389 --> 00:36:02,624
Listen, Cesar,

00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:04,359
you know, you're looking
at a lighter gig

00:36:04,425 --> 00:36:06,694
if you tell us
who paid you to kill Russell.

00:36:06,761 --> 00:36:07,862
( <i>inhales</i> )

00:36:07,929 --> 00:36:10,331
Nobody paid me
to kill him.

00:36:10,398 --> 00:36:12,734
What about your
buddy Mitch Urbana?

00:36:12,801 --> 00:36:15,870
He called a fight
for you back
in '79, right?

00:36:15,937 --> 00:36:18,139
Yeah. I won that fight.

00:36:18,206 --> 00:36:21,376
Mitch was the only judge
that got it right.

00:36:21,442 --> 00:36:23,645
But you're willing
to do time for that?

00:36:23,711 --> 00:36:25,780
Mitch said
the kid was selling his number.

00:36:25,847 --> 00:36:28,650
He asked me to follow him,
see what was going on.

00:36:28,716 --> 00:36:29,851
BROWN:
So, why

00:36:29,918 --> 00:36:31,953
were you driving
Mitch's car?

00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:34,556
What, was I supposed
to take the bus?

00:36:34,622 --> 00:36:36,491
My ride's been out all month.

00:36:36,558 --> 00:36:38,226
All right, how much
you get paid for the hit?

00:36:38,293 --> 00:36:39,994
It wasn't a hit.

00:36:40,061 --> 00:36:41,896
I did it on my own.

00:36:41,963 --> 00:36:43,064
I saw the money

00:36:43,131 --> 00:36:45,467
that runner was taking out
of those books.

00:36:45,533 --> 00:36:47,802
Making Mitch look bad.

00:36:47,869 --> 00:36:49,737
He deserved it.

00:36:54,042 --> 00:36:57,412
<i>They weren't so happy</i>
<i>with a shotgun in their face.</i>

00:36:57,479 --> 00:36:59,848
<i>I drove them out</i>
<i>to Rainbow Canyon.</i>

00:36:59,914 --> 00:37:01,049
( <i>gunshot</i> )

00:37:01,115 --> 00:37:03,017
I took the cash and stuff.

00:37:03,084 --> 00:37:04,319
I came back here.

00:37:04,385 --> 00:37:07,489
I called Mitch
and told him what went down.

00:37:07,555 --> 00:37:10,592
I said I'd kill him, too,
if he said anything.

00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:18,199
I knew you guys would find me
sooner or later.

00:37:18,266 --> 00:37:19,968
Dabo, tell me something.

00:37:20,034 --> 00:37:22,103
Why didn't you take
the kid's ring?

00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:23,705
That was worth something.

00:37:23,771 --> 00:37:27,008
DABO:
<i>Man, I thought</i>
<i>it was a Super Bowl ring.</i>

00:37:27,075 --> 00:37:30,245
<i>Freakin' AFFA.</i>

00:37:30,311 --> 00:37:32,947
That's my luck.

00:37:36,317 --> 00:37:39,687
How much does this thing weigh?

00:37:39,754 --> 00:37:43,024
240 pounds
at the moment.

00:37:43,091 --> 00:37:45,593
We'll increase the weight
incrementally

00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,662
until you can't move.

00:37:48,663 --> 00:37:50,431
SANDERS:
Oh, I can't lift that.

00:37:50,498 --> 00:37:52,000
And if I can't, you can't.

00:37:52,066 --> 00:37:53,802
This is a
safety issue.

00:37:53,868 --> 00:37:56,137
Well, that's what the pulley
is for, Greg,

00:37:56,204 --> 00:37:58,173
so relax and lie down
on your back.

00:38:01,376 --> 00:38:06,147
You know, this is exactly
like a dream I had once,

00:38:06,214 --> 00:38:08,483
except it wasn't in a garage.

00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:10,585
And Grissom wasn't watching.

00:38:10,652 --> 00:38:13,154
That was a
different dream.

00:38:13,221 --> 00:38:14,989
( <i>creaking</i> )

00:38:23,398 --> 00:38:25,099
How's it feel, dreamer?

00:38:25,166 --> 00:38:27,669
Like 240 pounds
of pure woman.

00:38:27,735 --> 00:38:29,504
How's your breathing?

00:38:29,571 --> 00:38:30,572
( <i>grunts</i> )

00:38:30,638 --> 00:38:31,639
Limited.

00:38:31,706 --> 00:38:33,441
Okay, add another 40 pounds.

00:38:43,751 --> 00:38:45,353
Ready.

00:38:59,234 --> 00:39:00,768
( <i>squeaking</i> )

00:39:00,835 --> 00:39:02,237
Well, the position's consistent

00:39:02,303 --> 00:39:03,605
with the victim.

00:39:03,671 --> 00:39:04,973
Face up, right arm is pinned.

00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:06,841
SIDLE:
If we could leave the
dummy on long enough,

00:39:06,908 --> 00:39:08,943
we could actually
match the blanching.

00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:10,311
( <i>high-pitched groaning</i> )

00:39:10,378 --> 00:39:12,547
Yeah, guys, help.

00:39:12,614 --> 00:39:14,516
Oh.

00:39:14,582 --> 00:39:15,617
( <i>grunts</i> )

00:39:15,683 --> 00:39:16,885
( <i>creaking</i> )

00:39:16,951 --> 00:39:18,386
Oh.

00:39:18,453 --> 00:39:20,855
280 pounds.

00:39:20,922 --> 00:39:22,457
Brenda's just shy of three.

00:39:22,524 --> 00:39:25,627
( <i>grunting</i> )

00:39:25,693 --> 00:39:28,897
( <i>gasping for breath</i> )

00:39:28,963 --> 00:39:31,132
( <i>choking</i> )

00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:34,869
SIDLE:
How long have you
had Type II diabetes?

00:39:34,936 --> 00:39:36,137
A few years.

00:39:36,204 --> 00:39:38,206
What difference does that make?

00:39:38,273 --> 00:39:40,375
You also have hypertension.

00:39:40,441 --> 00:39:43,044
Do you always ask questions
you already have the answers to?

00:39:43,111 --> 00:39:46,414
The night
that Maurice Hudson was killed,

00:39:46,481 --> 00:39:47,682
you'd been drinking.

00:39:47,749 --> 00:39:49,751
There was enough sweat
on the sheets

00:39:49,818 --> 00:39:50,919
to run a tox panel.

00:39:50,985 --> 00:39:52,654
I don't drink a lot.

00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,389
Well, it doesn't
take a lot

00:39:54,456 --> 00:39:56,524
for someone to
pass out who's on

00:39:56,591 --> 00:39:58,193
Propranolol and glucophage.

00:40:04,098 --> 00:40:06,935
It was an accident, wasn't it?

00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:17,712
Wake up. Wake up.

00:40:17,779 --> 00:40:19,681
( <i>crying</i> ):
Wake up.

00:40:19,747 --> 00:40:22,016
I just couldn't bear the jokes.

00:40:22,083 --> 00:40:24,519
( <i>crying</i> )

00:40:24,586 --> 00:40:27,455
Be some comedian's punch line.

00:40:27,522 --> 00:40:29,991
( <i>sniffles</i> )

00:40:36,164 --> 00:40:39,334
I would rather admit to murder
and go to jail...

00:40:41,336 --> 00:40:44,239
than to ever be that.

00:40:52,347 --> 00:40:56,050
I've finally regained feeling
in my spine, thanks for asking.

00:40:56,117 --> 00:40:58,386
GRISSOM:
A little technical reading,
Greg?

00:40:58,453 --> 00:41:02,123
Yeah, I guess I just wanted
to see what the big deal is.

00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:04,425
Attraction is subjective.

00:41:04,492 --> 00:41:06,461
It can't be analyzed.

00:41:06,528 --> 00:41:09,898
Yeah, I consider myself
to be pretty open-minded.

00:41:09,964 --> 00:41:13,735
Find other peoples'
predilections very intriguing.

00:41:13,802 --> 00:41:15,737
What do you like?

00:41:15,804 --> 00:41:18,540
What gets your juices flowing?

00:41:20,308 --> 00:41:22,152
Someone who doesn't judge me.
