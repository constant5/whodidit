( <i>soft moaning</i> )

00:00:48,461 --> 00:00:49,895
Freshman dorm, coed.

00:00:49,962 --> 00:00:52,264
Two DB's on the third floor--

00:00:52,331 --> 00:00:55,401
Trip Wilmont
and Paula Levine. Both 18.

00:00:55,468 --> 00:00:57,470
SANDERS:
Hey, Grissom,
when you went to college

00:00:57,536 --> 00:00:58,904
did you live in the dorms?

00:00:58,971 --> 00:01:00,906
Surely, you jest.

00:01:00,973 --> 00:01:02,007
You know,
they say a BA

00:01:02,074 --> 00:01:03,275
is worth
a million dollars

00:01:03,342 --> 00:01:04,844
in extra income
over a lifetime.

00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:07,079
Yeah, but the present cost
of college tuition

00:01:07,146 --> 00:01:08,347
is about the same amount.

00:01:08,414 --> 00:01:09,515
SANDERS:
So you're
saying college

00:01:09,582 --> 00:01:10,683
isn't worth
the expense?

00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,518
I guess it depends
on what you learn.

00:01:12,585 --> 00:01:14,019
BRASS:
So this is Trip's dorm room.

00:01:14,086 --> 00:01:16,489
When he missed a big B-ball game
this afternoon,

00:01:16,555 --> 00:01:17,823
his coach called his R.A.

00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:20,392
His R.A. got the kid next door
to jimmy the lock.

00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:22,027
Paramedics pronounced
and took off.

00:01:22,094 --> 00:01:23,763
The coroner's
en route.

00:01:36,442 --> 00:01:39,712
SIDLE:
Music, alcohol, candles.

00:01:39,779 --> 00:01:41,981
Kid was a regular Romeo.

00:01:42,047 --> 00:01:44,583
"For never was a story

00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:46,819
"of more woe than this of Juliet

00:01:46,886 --> 00:01:48,654
and her Romeo"

00:01:48,721 --> 00:01:49,822

00:01:52,358 --> 00:01:55,094

please.

00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:33,792
Sure.

00:02:35,917 --> 00:02:37,919
You feeling
okay, David?

00:02:37,986 --> 00:02:39,421
Yeah.

00:02:39,487 --> 00:02:42,457
Take a look at the skin
coloration on both victims.

00:02:42,524 --> 00:02:44,559
Their bodies
are slightly pink.

00:02:44,626 --> 00:02:48,630
And you're thinking "pink" skin
tones are a common effect

00:02:48,697 --> 00:02:50,465
of carbon monoxide fumes.

00:02:50,532 --> 00:02:52,867
That vomit's
also consistent

00:02:52,934 --> 00:02:54,269
with exposure to C.O.

00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,937
We'll need a sample
of that vomit.

00:02:56,004 --> 00:02:58,206
( <i>cell phone rings</i> )

00:02:58,273 --> 00:03:00,141
Grissom.

00:03:01,543 --> 00:03:02,978
Okay, I'll
be right there.

00:03:04,279 --> 00:03:06,047
My testimony's up
in the Hoyt case.

00:03:06,114 --> 00:03:07,315
I gotta go.

00:03:07,382 --> 00:03:09,351
I see no common source
for C.O.,

00:03:09,417 --> 00:03:11,720
so you'll have
to use the detector.

00:03:11,786 --> 00:03:13,288
You're running point.

00:03:14,556 --> 00:03:15,991
I knew something
was wrong.

00:03:16,057 --> 00:03:17,459
Trip lived
for basketball,

00:03:17,525 --> 00:03:18,660
and it was the semis,

00:03:18,727 --> 00:03:20,028
so there's no way
he'd miss a game.

00:03:20,095 --> 00:03:21,730
Yeah, I saw Susan
banging on his door,

00:03:21,796 --> 00:03:25,467
so I used my pocketknife
to jam it open.

00:03:25,533 --> 00:03:27,335
Had you done that before?
Yeah. All the time.

00:03:27,402 --> 00:03:29,571
Whenever Trip would get drunk
and lock himself out,

00:03:29,638 --> 00:03:31,373
he would bang
on my door.

00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:32,874
So you and Trip were friends?

00:03:32,941 --> 00:03:34,476
Me and Trip?
Mm-hmm.

00:03:34,542 --> 00:03:35,610
No. I'm not really
the type of guy

00:03:35,677 --> 00:03:36,912
that Trip Wilmont
would hang out with.

00:03:36,978 --> 00:03:39,314
So I guess that's a no?

00:03:39,381 --> 00:03:40,916
Yeah. But we had
Spanish 102 together.

00:03:40,982 --> 00:03:42,417
Sometimes he'd roll
over to my dorm,

00:03:42,484 --> 00:03:43,919
and I'd help him
with his homework.

00:03:43,985 --> 00:03:45,720
Did you help him,
or did you do it for him?

00:03:45,787 --> 00:03:48,390
Look, it's not the
Spanish Inquisition.

00:03:48,456 --> 00:03:50,258
For a jock, it could
have been a lot worse but,

00:03:50,325 --> 00:03:51,493
no, we weren't friends.

00:03:51,559 --> 00:03:52,827
Okay.

00:04:05,307 --> 00:04:06,641
( <i>beep</i> )

00:04:08,009 --> 00:04:09,844
No trace of carbon monoxide.

00:04:12,414 --> 00:04:16,351
There's a trace of semen
on the door handle.

00:04:21,489 --> 00:04:23,758
( <i>beep</i> )

00:04:23,825 --> 00:04:25,060
This one, too.

00:04:27,629 --> 00:04:29,097
Trophy condoms.

00:04:29,164 --> 00:04:30,375
Trophy condoms?

00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:32,777
When a stud scores,
he announces his victory

00:04:32,844 --> 00:04:35,546
by putting his spoils
on his neighbor's doorknob.

00:04:35,613 --> 00:04:39,150
Oh. Well, my bet
is Trip scored a lot.

00:04:39,217 --> 00:04:41,586
( <i>explosion</i> )

00:04:43,688 --> 00:04:45,690
Everyone okay?

00:04:51,696 --> 00:04:53,197
Excuse me.

00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,345
Spontaneous

00:05:07,412 --> 00:05:09,580
toilet combustion?

00:05:09,647 --> 00:05:12,583
Or a college prank.

00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:14,919
You think this has anything
to do with the case?

00:05:14,986 --> 00:05:17,355
20 feet away
from two dead kids.

00:05:17,422 --> 00:05:19,090
We got
to check it out.

00:05:19,157 --> 00:05:22,326
Guess you should, uh...
start processing.

00:05:38,142 --> 00:05:39,577
Conrad.

00:05:39,644 --> 00:05:40,945
Hey, Detective.

00:05:41,012 --> 00:05:42,780
Homicide called you guys
over an hour ago.

00:05:42,847 --> 00:05:43,815
419 at the Tangiers.

00:05:43,881 --> 00:05:45,950
No one's responded.
Not even the coroner.

00:05:46,017 --> 00:05:47,618
Have you tried Grissom
or Catherine?

00:05:47,685 --> 00:05:49,620
Catherine's on a case,
I think. Grissom...

00:05:49,687 --> 00:05:51,389
Oh, that's right.
Grissom's in court.

00:05:51,456 --> 00:05:53,558
Oh. And Sofia's still
on her Task Force leave.

00:05:53,624 --> 00:05:54,692
Both shifts are tapped.

00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:55,927
Did you check...?
I checked the board.

00:05:55,993 --> 00:05:58,196
No one's available...

00:05:58,262 --> 00:06:00,064
except for you.

00:06:02,767 --> 00:06:05,069
I'm the Assistant
Lab Director.

00:06:05,136 --> 00:06:07,271
I know. But you're
still qualified

00:06:07,338 --> 00:06:08,940
to process
a scene, right?

00:06:09,007 --> 00:06:10,508
Yes, I am.

00:06:11,442 --> 00:06:14,645
I'll dust off my kit.

00:06:14,712 --> 00:06:16,247
Meet you there.

00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:21,085
Hey, Doc.

00:06:21,152 --> 00:06:22,587
Two dead bodies.

00:06:22,653 --> 00:06:24,222
Both were in perfect health.

00:06:24,288 --> 00:06:25,857
I am so hoping
that you have

00:06:25,923 --> 00:06:27,592
more in your
report than that.

00:06:27,658 --> 00:06:30,795
There are two toxins which can
turn a body pink postmortem.

00:06:30,862 --> 00:06:32,296
We already ruled
out carbon monoxide.

00:06:32,363 --> 00:06:34,232
Which leaves one--
cyanide ingestion.

00:06:34,298 --> 00:06:35,633
Interesting fact
about cyanide--

00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,735
not everyone can smell it.

00:06:37,802 --> 00:06:39,270
Right. It's a genetic quirk.

00:06:39,337 --> 00:06:41,606
Unfortunately,
I don't have that ability.

00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,443
"The Nose" has arrived.

00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,512
Hodges has
the genetic quirk?

00:06:47,578 --> 00:06:48,913
It's a blessing

00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,349
and a curse.

00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:55,286
Stomach contents
of both decedents.

00:06:55,353 --> 00:06:57,355
Hodges, start
your sniffer.

00:07:08,266 --> 00:07:11,736
Hints of stale beer and...

00:07:11,803 --> 00:07:13,738
Cheese Whiz.

00:07:13,805 --> 00:07:15,473
But I don't smell any cyanide.

00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,641
Thank you.

00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:18,209
Anytime.

00:07:19,644 --> 00:07:21,946
Well, all due respect
to "The Nose,"

00:07:22,013 --> 00:07:25,717
I would still like to send
a sample of blood to Tox.

00:07:25,783 --> 00:07:26,818
It's already done.

00:07:26,884 --> 00:07:28,219
Is there anything else?

00:07:28,286 --> 00:07:31,389
Nothing on or in the body
indicates cause of death.

00:07:31,456 --> 00:07:34,158
Nothing consistent
with homicide whatsoever.

00:07:34,225 --> 00:07:37,495
Two college kids die under
mysterious circumstances.

00:07:37,562 --> 00:07:40,765
Let's treat this as a homicide
till we know otherwise.

00:07:43,801 --> 00:07:45,336
Finally.

00:07:46,604 --> 00:07:48,106
Yeah, well three hours.

00:07:48,172 --> 00:07:49,874
All right. Thanks.

00:07:53,277 --> 00:07:55,413
Crime scene's getting cold.

00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,482
Had to refill
my powders.

00:07:59,183 --> 00:08:02,420
I found a rental
car agreement in
the glove box.

00:08:02,487 --> 00:08:05,023
James Billmeyer.
New Jersey.

00:08:05,089 --> 00:08:06,824
He's not registered
at the hotel.

00:08:06,891 --> 00:08:09,027
Probably stopped by
to lose a few bucks.

00:08:09,093 --> 00:08:11,295
Did the coroner
step in the blood?

00:08:11,362 --> 00:08:13,364
No. We're still
waiting on him.

00:08:13,431 --> 00:08:15,199
That shoe print belongs
to Mrs. Vivoldi.

00:08:15,266 --> 00:08:16,234
She called it in.

00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,235
We been waiting on you

00:08:17,301 --> 00:08:18,236
to take her statement.

00:08:18,302 --> 00:08:19,570
Let's do it.

00:08:19,637 --> 00:08:21,639
Yes, let's do it.

00:08:22,807 --> 00:08:25,076
Thanks.

00:08:25,143 --> 00:08:26,644
Ma'am, sorry to
keep you waiting.

00:08:26,711 --> 00:08:27,745
I'm Detective Vartann.

00:08:27,812 --> 00:08:29,714
This is Conrad Ecklie
from the crime lab.

00:08:29,781 --> 00:08:31,849
Do you mind if we
ask you a few questions?

00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:33,184
I'd mind if you didn't.

00:08:33,251 --> 00:08:35,019
I am the one
who found the body.

00:08:35,086 --> 00:08:36,454
Yes. At the time,

00:08:36,521 --> 00:08:39,590
were you walking
to or from the hotel?

00:08:39,657 --> 00:08:41,993
I'd had just finished
lunch with the girls.

00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,395
We say "girls,"
but we're, you know, women.

00:08:44,462 --> 00:08:47,699
I don't find being
called a "girl" derogatory.

00:08:47,765 --> 00:08:49,567
That's good. To or from?

00:08:49,634 --> 00:08:52,136
I was walking to the car.
The SUV?

00:08:52,203 --> 00:08:53,237
A gift from Oscar.

00:08:53,304 --> 00:08:55,873
30 years with the same man.

00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,208
Congratulations.

00:08:57,275 --> 00:08:58,743
Thank you. Are you married?

00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:00,445
Divorced.

00:09:00,511 --> 00:09:02,313
Oh. And you?

00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:06,551
Uh... ma'am, so you were
walking to your car...

00:09:06,617 --> 00:09:08,219
Walking to the car,

00:09:08,286 --> 00:09:11,456
and I think I stepped
into gum or something...

00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:16,661
( <i>screams</i> )

00:09:16,728 --> 00:09:17,829
That's when I called

00:09:17,895 --> 00:09:19,664
911.

00:09:19,731 --> 00:09:21,132
Which was about, um...

00:09:21,199 --> 00:09:23,434
two hours ago.

00:09:23,501 --> 00:09:24,836
I'm sorry, ma'am.

00:09:24,902 --> 00:09:26,571
We've been very busy.

00:09:26,637 --> 00:09:27,972
I'm going to need

00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:29,407
your shoes.

00:09:29,474 --> 00:09:30,808
We'll get them
back to you.

00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:32,910
Even wash off the blood.

00:09:32,977 --> 00:09:35,646
WOMAN:
<i>I just talked to Paula</i>

00:09:35,713 --> 00:09:38,049
yesterday afternoon.

00:09:38,116 --> 00:09:42,020
She was on her way
to the library.

00:09:42,086 --> 00:09:46,357
She had a biology final
this morning.

00:09:46,424 --> 00:09:48,926
She shouldn't have
been in a boy's room.

00:09:48,993 --> 00:09:50,862
None of this makes any sense.

00:09:50,928 --> 00:09:52,630
Trip was a serious athlete.

00:09:52,697 --> 00:09:56,100
He would never sleep around
the night before...

00:09:56,167 --> 00:09:57,402
Sleep around?

00:09:57,468 --> 00:09:59,070
It's not like your daughter

00:09:59,137 --> 00:10:00,538
was Trip's girlfriend.

00:10:00,605 --> 00:10:02,340
Ms. Sidle...

00:10:02,407 --> 00:10:04,008
I need to know.

00:10:04,075 --> 00:10:05,977
Did Trip take advantage...?

00:10:06,044 --> 00:10:07,445
Did he force himself

00:10:07,512 --> 00:10:08,680
on Paula?

00:10:08,746 --> 00:10:10,548
My son would never
force himself on anyone.

00:10:10,615 --> 00:10:13,051
Trip could have
any girl he wanted.

00:10:13,117 --> 00:10:16,287
Mrs. Levine, the coroner
found no evidence of assault.

00:10:17,955 --> 00:10:21,259
Did Paula ever
mention Trip to you?

00:10:23,361 --> 00:10:24,796
No.

00:10:24,862 --> 00:10:26,564
I know she liked a boy

00:10:26,631 --> 00:10:28,499
on the basketball team.

00:10:28,566 --> 00:10:30,468
I never
knew his name.

00:10:30,535 --> 00:10:31,936
I guess it was Trip.

00:10:33,237 --> 00:10:37,475
I just want to know
what happened to them.

00:10:39,911 --> 00:10:41,846
So do I.

00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,427
( <i>garbled radio transmissions)</i>

00:10:52,695 --> 00:10:54,730
This land used
to be part of
the Bennett estate.

00:10:54,797 --> 00:10:57,633
Bill Bennett?
Guy who owns
the Sahara?

00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,634
Yeah.
Huh.

00:10:58,701 --> 00:11:00,542
We used to come
out here

00:11:00,542 --> 00:11:02,611
when we were
in high school.

00:11:02,678 --> 00:11:06,048
Used to be, like,
a seven-acre lover's lane.

00:11:06,115 --> 00:11:07,583
I thought you said
you were a dork
in high school.

00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:09,184
I was a dork
in high school.

00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:10,185
I'm still
a dork,

00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:11,320
but I had dimples.

00:11:11,387 --> 00:11:12,621
I got a little action.

00:11:12,688 --> 00:11:14,056
I don't doubt that.
Hey, Dave.

00:11:14,123 --> 00:11:16,992
Oh, hello.

00:11:17,059 --> 00:11:19,929
The path to the body
was made by the paramedics.

00:11:19,995 --> 00:11:22,031
They pronounced
and took off.

00:11:22,097 --> 00:11:25,267
ID'ed has Kevin Staniland,
age 30 from Reno.

00:11:25,334 --> 00:11:27,336
I figured before
I processed the body,

00:11:27,403 --> 00:11:30,339
you'd want to photograph
the crop circle.

00:11:30,406 --> 00:11:31,740
Crop circle?

00:11:31,807 --> 00:11:34,143
PHILLIPS:
Well, it's a circle
in the middle of a field.

00:11:34,209 --> 00:11:35,544
What would
you call it?

00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,413
I guess it's
a crop circle.

00:11:40,482 --> 00:11:41,850
The guy has a blindfold on.

00:11:41,917 --> 00:11:43,919
WILLOWS:
Pin the tail on the donkey
gone wrong?

00:11:47,523 --> 00:11:50,125
Lividity is fixed.

00:11:50,192 --> 00:11:51,493
Lividity's fixed?

00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,262
So this wasn't
a body dump?

00:11:53,329 --> 00:11:54,496
He died there?

00:11:54,563 --> 00:11:56,732
The only pathway
is from the paramedics.

00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,734
How'd he end up
in the middle of the circle?

00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,703
I have an idea.

00:12:02,237 --> 00:12:04,840
I'll keep it to myself.

00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:19,555
Hey.
How's it going?

00:12:19,622 --> 00:12:22,691
I swabbed every square inch
of this toilet.

00:12:22,758 --> 00:12:25,661
So far, no evidence
of explosive powders

00:12:25,728 --> 00:12:27,596
or a detonation device.

00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:28,897
Well, I spoke
with maintenance.

00:12:28,964 --> 00:12:30,065
It is an isolated incident.

00:12:30,132 --> 00:12:32,034
There are no other
reports of exploding johns.

00:12:32,101 --> 00:12:34,236
How about
methane gas?

00:12:34,303 --> 00:12:36,372
Maybe there's a natural reserve
under the dorm.

00:12:36,438 --> 00:12:38,173
Theoretically, pressure
could have built up,

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,943
broken a sewer pipe
and shot up through the toilet.

00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,244
Yeah.

00:12:42,311 --> 00:12:43,846
I already checked.

00:12:43,913 --> 00:12:46,949
There's no methane gas
in this region of Clare County.

00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:49,351
Well, there's got to be
some logical explanation.

00:12:49,418 --> 00:12:51,320
Well, if dorm food
is as bad as I can remember,

00:12:51,387 --> 00:12:54,023
we should consider
explosive diarrhea.

00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,600
Crop circles?

00:13:04,667 --> 00:13:06,135
( <i>laughs</i> )

00:13:06,201 --> 00:13:07,503
Come on, Super Dave.

00:13:07,569 --> 00:13:10,606
Wasn't the Alien Autopsy
embarrassing enough?

00:13:10,673 --> 00:13:11,807
Given the circumstances,

00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,943
alien was not an unreasonable
conclusion at the time.

00:13:14,009 --> 00:13:15,911
You need to get
a girlfriend.

00:13:15,978 --> 00:13:17,012
I'm engaged,

00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:19,081
but thank you.

00:13:19,148 --> 00:13:19,815
Could you just check out
his pants?

00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:22,484
There's grass stains
on his knees.

00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:24,019
That's odd, because
the grass around the victim

00:13:24,086 --> 00:13:25,020
was undisturbed.

00:13:25,087 --> 00:13:27,323
His tighty whiteys
were soaked in urine.

00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:29,558
Don't know if it's
pre- or postmortem.

00:13:31,126 --> 00:13:32,361
Oh!

00:13:32,428 --> 00:13:33,996
Now, that's alien.

00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,197
What is that?

00:13:35,264 --> 00:13:36,966
I've got to document this.

00:13:37,933 --> 00:13:38,867
Oh, hang on.

00:13:38,934 --> 00:13:40,502
We have ourselves a tapeworm,
gentlemen.

00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,472
This guy's been eating

00:13:43,539 --> 00:13:48,277
meat or fish
infected with tapeworm cyst.

00:13:52,381 --> 00:13:55,184
WARRICK:
<i>Yeah, that cyst grows up</i>
<i>to be nice fat tapeworm</i>

00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:57,586
<i>that attaches itself</i>
<i>to the intestinal wall</i>

00:13:57,653 --> 00:13:59,488
<i>and suck out</i>
<i>all your nutrients.</i>

00:13:59,555 --> 00:14:02,424
Yeah, and since this guy's
already dead,

00:14:02,491 --> 00:14:04,994
the tapeworm
needs to find
a new host.

00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:05,995
Only two ways out.

00:14:06,061 --> 00:14:07,730
I'm glad it picked the mouth.

00:14:07,796 --> 00:14:08,731
( <i>all chuckle</i> )

00:14:08,797 --> 00:14:09,732
Well, the tapeworm

00:14:09,798 --> 00:14:10,933
could have made the guy sick,

00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,101
but it didn't kill him.

00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,237
Hello.

00:14:15,304 --> 00:14:17,172
Hey.
Want to talk
about semen?

00:14:17,239 --> 00:14:18,607
Okay.
Okey-doke.

00:14:18,674 --> 00:14:20,709
The semen
on the vic's
doorknob

00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:22,378
and the neighbor's
doorknob

00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:24,346
is consistent
with Trip's DNA.

00:14:24,413 --> 00:14:26,815
So, what I'm thinking
is that Trip

00:14:26,882 --> 00:14:30,786
put a trophy condom
onto his neighbor's door

00:14:30,853 --> 00:14:32,321
and then transferred
a trace

00:14:32,388 --> 00:14:33,555
of his reproductive
material

00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:34,990
back onto
his own doorknob.

00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,129
( <i>chuckling</i> )

00:14:40,195 --> 00:14:42,031
You've, uh, you've heard
of trophy condoms?

00:14:42,097 --> 00:14:44,566
Sara, I went to college.

00:14:46,068 --> 00:14:47,503
Ladies, I just spoke

00:14:47,569 --> 00:14:50,172
with Western LVU's
Student Affairs Officer.

00:14:50,239 --> 00:14:53,108
Apparently, Trip's next-door
neighbor, Zack Capola

00:14:53,175 --> 00:14:55,311
filed several grievances
against him.

00:14:55,377 --> 00:14:57,179
I'm headed
over there now.

00:14:57,246 --> 00:14:58,881
I'll drive.

00:14:58,948 --> 00:15:00,516
You always do.

00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:04,053
So, crop circles and tapeworms,
you got quite a case.

00:15:04,119 --> 00:15:05,154
Mm.

00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,422
You have C.O.D.?

00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:09,658
I have T.O.D.,
about midday yesterday.

00:15:09,725 --> 00:15:11,927
Cause of death
is less definitive.

00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,129
Cuts and abrasions
are superficial.

00:15:14,196 --> 00:15:17,032
There's no obvious
anatomical defect.

00:15:17,099 --> 00:15:22,237
And at this point, I'm going
to have to check the default--

00:15:22,304 --> 00:15:23,906
cardiac arrhythmia.

00:15:23,973 --> 00:15:26,909
A young man's heart stops,
and you don't know why?

00:15:26,976 --> 00:15:29,278
Tox and vitreous lytes
are all normal.

00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,046
That's all you're
getting from me.

00:15:32,147 --> 00:15:34,516
BOY:
<i>This is bunk.</i>

00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:36,318
I was told my grievances
were confidential.

00:15:36,385 --> 00:15:38,087
They said my name
wasn't even on the form.

00:15:38,153 --> 00:15:40,422
Why was confidentiality
so important?

00:15:40,489 --> 00:15:41,757
Ask him.

00:15:41,824 --> 00:15:43,792
You look like you were
a jock in college.

00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:45,427
Me?
Him?

00:15:45,494 --> 00:15:47,563
Whatever.

00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,732
Look, if it had gotten around
that I had ratted out Trip,

00:15:49,798 --> 00:15:51,700
the whole basketball team
would have come down on me.

00:15:51,767 --> 00:15:53,302
You are a straight-A student.

00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,337
We've reviewed
your academic records.

00:15:55,404 --> 00:15:57,006
The distractions

00:15:57,072 --> 00:15:58,307
must've
pissed you off.

00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,442
You had problems
with his loud music,

00:16:00,509 --> 00:16:01,777
banging on the wall,

00:16:01,844 --> 00:16:04,313
used condoms hanging
on your doorknob.

00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,548
A handful of used condoms
would have pissed you off, too.

00:16:06,615 --> 00:16:07,783
Look, what are you getting at?

00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:08,617
We're trying
to figure out

00:16:08,684 --> 00:16:09,351
what happened
to Trip and Paula.

00:16:09,418 --> 00:16:10,519
Earlier you said

00:16:10,586 --> 00:16:12,288
he wasn't
such a bad guy.

00:16:12,354 --> 00:16:15,858
Because I didn't see a need
to badmouth the dead.

00:16:15,925 --> 00:16:17,893
But you want the truth,
he was an ass, okay?

00:16:31,707 --> 00:16:33,876
Well, Conrad,
can I help you?

00:16:33,943 --> 00:16:35,477
Where have you been?

00:16:35,544 --> 00:16:37,646
I posted three bodies
and then I took a time-out.

00:16:37,713 --> 00:16:40,115
A time-out?

00:16:40,182 --> 00:16:41,216
A personal hour.

00:16:41,283 --> 00:16:43,953
A few weeks ago,
my Siamese had kittens.

00:16:44,019 --> 00:16:46,021
I went by the house
to check on 'em.

00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,222
They're just about weaned.

00:16:47,289 --> 00:16:48,223
You want one?

00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:51,293
I'm allergic.

00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,429
So tell me
about James Billmeyer.

00:16:53,495 --> 00:16:55,197
Guy found at the Tangiers.

00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,832
I'm just about
to post him.

00:16:56,899 --> 00:16:59,668
Per my prelim, there was
an abraded laceration

00:16:59,735 --> 00:17:01,537
to the right occipital scalp,

00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:03,038
and a penetration
of the epithelium,

00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,139
but not the galea.

00:17:04,206 --> 00:17:05,708
It's not what killed him,

00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:08,744
but I'll know the full story
once I open him up.

00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,716
I saw David
put him in here.

00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:15,117
So where is he?

00:17:15,184 --> 00:17:17,286
I'm not sure.

00:17:17,353 --> 00:17:18,954
Maybe he's taking
a time-out.

00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,591
David probably moved him.

00:17:22,658 --> 00:17:23,792
He had no reason to.

00:17:26,695 --> 00:17:27,696
A few years back,

00:17:27,763 --> 00:17:30,099
a body was
prematurely sent
to a mortician.

00:17:30,165 --> 00:17:31,233
Remember that?

00:17:35,604 --> 00:17:37,640
This is weird.

00:17:37,706 --> 00:17:39,308
Maybe someone
in your department

00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:40,542
mislabeled the corpse?

00:17:40,609 --> 00:17:42,578
It's highly unlikely.

00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:44,480
Fine. When you find him,
get back to me.

00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:22,750
Sir?

00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,375
We have a situation.

00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:25,844
I know.
A body disappeared.

00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:26,878
No, no.

00:18:26,945 --> 00:18:28,413
Mr. Billmeyer didn't disappear.

00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,148
He's missing.
There's a difference.

00:18:30,215 --> 00:18:31,216
Sir, this isn't my fault.

00:18:31,282 --> 00:18:32,550
You prepped him for autopsy,
right?

00:18:32,617 --> 00:18:33,418
Yes, sir.

00:18:33,485 --> 00:18:34,452
Walk me through that.

00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:35,920
Walk you through what?

00:18:35,987 --> 00:18:37,122
Everything you did

00:18:37,188 --> 00:18:38,957
to Mr. Billmeyer.

00:18:39,023 --> 00:18:42,160
Okay, um, I brought him
into the washroom,

00:18:42,227 --> 00:18:44,996
<i>photographed the body,</i>

00:18:45,063 --> 00:18:47,065
<i>took hair</i>
<i>and fingernail cuttings,</i>

00:18:47,132 --> 00:18:50,168
<i>emptied his pockets,</i>

00:18:50,235 --> 00:18:51,569
<i>removed clothing,</i>

00:18:51,636 --> 00:18:53,471
<i>washed his body, tagged him.</i>

00:18:53,538 --> 00:18:56,074
<i>I put him into the cooler</i>

00:18:56,141 --> 00:18:58,510
and I haven't seen him since.

00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,648
What?

00:19:03,715 --> 00:19:04,749
I was just thinking, David.

00:19:04,816 --> 00:19:05,784
I've lost my keys,

00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:06,918
sunglasses,
even a wallet.

00:19:06,985 --> 00:19:08,419
Sir, this really isn't my fault.

00:19:08,486 --> 00:19:09,254
But I've never lost a body.

00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,355
I didn't do anything.
Find him,
Phillips,

00:19:10,421 --> 00:19:11,623
or this goes on your record.

00:19:11,689 --> 00:19:12,190
What would you like me to do?

00:19:12,257 --> 00:19:14,459
Get out! Get out.

00:19:14,526 --> 00:19:15,460
Out!

00:19:15,527 --> 00:19:16,694
I don...

00:19:16,761 --> 00:19:17,929
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:19:17,996 --> 00:19:22,133
Six-one, brown hair and eyes,
about 200 pounds.

00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,502
Are you sure?

00:19:24,569 --> 00:19:25,703
All right, thanks.

00:19:27,205 --> 00:19:29,407
I've checked every mortuary
and funeral home in the city,

00:19:29,474 --> 00:19:30,975
no luck.

00:19:31,042 --> 00:19:32,744
Right, 'cause you never
authorized a transfer.

00:19:32,811 --> 00:19:34,345
David, are you familiar

00:19:34,412 --> 00:19:36,681
with the Latin word
<i>necrostuprum?</i>

00:19:36,748 --> 00:19:39,083
Body snatcher?

00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:41,252
We didn't mislabel
or misplace the body.

00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:42,754
Someone took it.

00:19:42,821 --> 00:19:44,055
If you wanted to steal a body,

00:19:44,122 --> 00:19:46,057
wouldn't it be a lot easier
to go to a hospital

00:19:46,124 --> 00:19:47,058
or university facility?

00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:48,159
Absolutely,

00:19:48,226 --> 00:19:51,863
which means somebody wanted
this particular body.

00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:54,766
Some of the leading theories
on crop circles

00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:58,570
include extraterrestrials,
wind vortexes, Earth energies,

00:19:58,636 --> 00:20:00,004
and of course,
hoaxes.

00:20:00,071 --> 00:20:03,408
But in 1985,
farmers near one
U.S. military base

00:20:03,475 --> 00:20:06,244
suspected the source
of a recent incident
to be the downwash

00:20:06,311 --> 00:20:08,179
from a helicopter's
rotor blades.

00:20:08,246 --> 00:20:10,348
<i>The spinning of the blades</i>
<i>caused the chopper to rise</i>

00:20:10,415 --> 00:20:11,349
<i>forced the air downward,</i>

00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:13,418
in effect, bending
the grass below.

00:20:13,485 --> 00:20:14,486
For every action,

00:20:14,552 --> 00:20:16,888
there is an opposite
but equal reaction.

00:20:16,955 --> 00:20:20,725
Since I'm a skeptic
when it comes to aliens
and Earth energies, ooh.

00:20:20,792 --> 00:20:22,994
So we started
with the chopper.

00:20:23,061 --> 00:20:24,162
Hey, Archie.

00:20:24,229 --> 00:20:25,263
Oh, hey.

00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:28,333
Nellis sent over
the radar surveillance.

00:20:28,399 --> 00:20:30,101
Current feed goes back 48 hours.

00:20:30,168 --> 00:20:31,669
This is where your decedent
was located.

00:20:31,736 --> 00:20:35,206
Decedent's T.O.D. was
approximately 12:00 noon,

00:20:35,273 --> 00:20:36,374
yesterday.

00:20:38,243 --> 00:20:42,113
Using echo and Doppler shift we
can determine an object's speed.

00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,681
( <i>computer beeping</i> )

00:20:43,748 --> 00:20:45,150
Freeze the frame, Archie.

00:20:46,151 --> 00:20:47,819
Found your chopper.

00:20:47,886 --> 00:20:50,021
It's holding steady.
Airplanes can't do that.

00:20:50,088 --> 00:20:51,856
Let's see who owns it.

00:20:56,261 --> 00:20:58,897
( <i>phone rings</i> )

00:20:58,963 --> 00:21:01,800
Hey, I got your 911.

00:21:01,866 --> 00:21:03,234
Don't you work days?

00:21:03,301 --> 00:21:05,437
Ecklie keeps moving me around.

00:21:05,503 --> 00:21:08,339
Your pink college kids
were both blotto.

00:21:08,406 --> 00:21:10,175
Yeah, there were beer bottles
at the scene.

00:21:10,241 --> 00:21:11,176
That's not a surprise.

00:21:11,242 --> 00:21:12,811
You want a surprise?
Check this out.

00:21:12,877 --> 00:21:14,946
Now, I know you and Greg tested
the scene for carbon monoxide,

00:21:15,013 --> 00:21:17,215
but did you check
for carbon <i>dioxide?</i>

00:21:17,282 --> 00:21:19,417
No.

00:21:19,484 --> 00:21:21,052
I've been a CSI
eight years.

00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:24,189
I have never processed
a C02 scene.

00:21:24,255 --> 00:21:25,256
I mean, you'd need

00:21:25,323 --> 00:21:27,792
a ton of that gas
to cause serious damage.

00:21:27,859 --> 00:21:29,360
It's a first
for me, too.

00:21:29,427 --> 00:21:32,263
I found traces of blood
in Trip's vomit.

00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:34,365
C02 levels are usually .03%.

00:21:34,432 --> 00:21:35,567
His levels were 8%.
Lethal.

00:21:35,633 --> 00:21:41,139
C02 replaces oxygen
on hemoglobin molecules.

00:21:41,206 --> 00:21:44,075
At 8%, those kids
would've literally
suffocated

00:21:44,142 --> 00:21:45,877
on a cellular level.

00:21:45,944 --> 00:21:47,345
Still doesn't explain why
they were pretty in pink.

00:21:47,412 --> 00:21:49,948
Carbon dioxide,
unlike carbon monoxide,

00:21:50,014 --> 00:21:51,249
doesn't affect
skin coloration.

00:21:51,316 --> 00:21:52,517
So what did?

00:21:54,385 --> 00:21:56,788
What are we expecting
to find here?

00:21:56,855 --> 00:21:58,356
Someone went to
a lot of trouble

00:21:58,423 --> 00:21:59,691
to steal
James Billmeyer...

00:21:59,757 --> 00:22:02,227
Maybe there's a clue
in his personal effects.

00:22:02,293 --> 00:22:04,762
So you're a CSI now?

00:22:04,829 --> 00:22:08,066
If I were, I would have
printed the cooler.

00:22:08,133 --> 00:22:10,235
Really?

00:22:11,269 --> 00:22:13,204
Maybe you should
just put together a list

00:22:13,271 --> 00:22:15,240
of everyone who had access
to the morgue.

00:22:15,306 --> 00:22:19,144
Law enforcement
personnel, CSIs,
paramedics,

00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:21,312
funeral home personnel,
maintenance workers,

00:22:21,379 --> 00:22:23,214
hospital workers,
janitors...

00:22:23,281 --> 00:22:24,949
people that get lost
in the building...

00:22:25,016 --> 00:22:26,351
Yeah, that sounds good.

00:22:26,417 --> 00:22:28,319
Two pairs of socks,
two pairs of underwear,

00:22:28,386 --> 00:22:30,155
two T-shirts.
That tells me the guy

00:22:30,221 --> 00:22:31,689
was going to be staying
in Vegas for two days.

00:22:31,756 --> 00:22:34,592
Your powers of deduction
are remarkable, Detective.

00:22:34,659 --> 00:22:37,028
Thank you.

00:22:39,497 --> 00:22:42,333
"Jacinda Hendler,
call me."

00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,935
Written on an
airline napkin.

00:22:44,002 --> 00:22:45,336
Decedent probably met her
on the flight,

00:22:45,403 --> 00:22:46,438
possibly hours before he died.

00:22:46,504 --> 00:22:47,372
You think?

00:22:50,542 --> 00:22:52,143
I'll run it down.

00:22:53,745 --> 00:22:55,313
WOMAN:
Yeah, I know Jamie.

00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,915
He's a sweet man.

00:22:56,981 --> 00:22:58,583
He was supposed to call me.

00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:00,051
What happened to him?

00:23:00,118 --> 00:23:01,219
He died.

00:23:01,286 --> 00:23:02,353
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:04,556
Why'd you contact me?

00:23:04,622 --> 00:23:05,957
Well, your name
was in his pocket.

00:23:06,024 --> 00:23:08,059
Napkin.

00:23:08,126 --> 00:23:10,028
We, uh, we met
on the plane.

00:23:10,094 --> 00:23:11,396
( <i>laughs</i> )

00:23:11,463 --> 00:23:14,599
And, uh, there was only
one blanket, so we...

00:23:14,666 --> 00:23:16,401
shared it, and I got
a little frisky,

00:23:16,468 --> 00:23:17,702
and...

00:23:17,769 --> 00:23:20,572
Anyway, there was a kid
sitting two seats away, so...

00:23:20,638 --> 00:23:22,006
So you gave him your number...

00:23:23,108 --> 00:23:24,576
...to meet up later?

00:23:24,642 --> 00:23:26,377
Yeah.

00:23:26,444 --> 00:23:28,446
Do you have any idea
who may've killed him?

00:23:28,513 --> 00:23:29,914
Or who might want

00:23:29,981 --> 00:23:30,982
his body

00:23:31,049 --> 00:23:33,118
in its current condition?
No.

00:23:33,184 --> 00:23:35,653
Jamie told me that
he-he was flying in to party

00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,422
with some pals from high school

00:23:37,489 --> 00:23:38,623
in Seven Hills.

00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:40,058
Said he'd
invite me over.

00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:41,826
Figured he blew me off.

00:23:41,893 --> 00:23:43,128
It-it happens.

00:23:43,194 --> 00:23:44,329
I mean...

00:23:44,395 --> 00:23:46,231
I have a healthy self-esteem.

00:23:46,297 --> 00:23:48,766
Good for you.

00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:50,935
Yes.

00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:57,876
Thanks.

00:23:57,942 --> 00:24:00,979
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:24:01,045 --> 00:24:03,248
What exactly are
we looking for?

00:24:03,314 --> 00:24:07,051
Most sources of carbon dioxide
come from...

00:24:07,118 --> 00:24:10,388
factories, cars and volcanoes,

00:24:10,455 --> 00:24:13,291
not something we're gonna find
in a dorm room.

00:24:13,358 --> 00:24:15,693
Maybe somebody pumped
the gas in through a vent.

00:24:16,728 --> 00:24:18,663
Uh, sex journal.

00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:20,832
Lists of girls...

00:24:20,899 --> 00:24:22,500
dates...

00:24:22,567 --> 00:24:24,702
and sexual activities.

00:24:24,769 --> 00:24:26,471
Boys and their conquests.

00:24:26,538 --> 00:24:28,006
I've never even heard

00:24:28,072 --> 00:24:29,207
of some of these.

00:24:29,274 --> 00:24:30,809
Really?

00:24:30,875 --> 00:24:31,943
Never mind.

00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:34,312
Would you help me move
the bed, please?

00:24:40,752 --> 00:24:42,120
There's a fresh hole
in the wall.

00:24:42,187 --> 00:24:43,555
Splinters are

00:24:43,621 --> 00:24:44,989
on the inside.

00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:47,192
Someone drilled in
from the other side.

00:24:47,258 --> 00:24:49,260
( <i>knock on door</i> )
Hey.

00:24:49,327 --> 00:24:50,628
Hi, Zack.

00:24:50,695 --> 00:24:52,430
Mind if we come in?
Why?

00:24:56,701 --> 00:24:59,237
SANDERS:
Ah, you're a car buff, huh?

00:24:59,304 --> 00:25:00,939
I guess.
Yeah, me, too.

00:25:01,005 --> 00:25:02,474
I always wanted
a Testarossa.

00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:04,542
What about you,
what's your dream car?

ZACK:
Uh, I don't know.

00:25:07,779 --> 00:25:10,148
Zack, can you explain
this hole in your wall?

00:25:10,215 --> 00:25:11,983
I didn't even know
there was one.

( <i>sighs</i> )

SIDLE:
I think maybe

00:25:17,122 --> 00:25:18,256
we should step outside.

00:25:18,323 --> 00:25:20,158
Your room is now
a crime scene.

00:25:42,347 --> 00:25:43,882
Are you Morgan Wendel?
Yeah.

00:25:43,948 --> 00:25:45,350
We're from
the Crime Lab.

00:25:45,416 --> 00:25:47,385
We have information
that put your chopper

00:25:47,452 --> 00:25:49,420
at a crime scene
yesterday, around noon.

00:25:49,487 --> 00:25:50,722
You're here about Kevin.

00:25:50,789 --> 00:25:52,190
That's right, yeah.

00:25:52,257 --> 00:25:55,193
I'll tell you everything,
but I want immunity.

00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:57,095
MAN:
<i>All right, Kevin!</i>

00:25:57,162 --> 00:25:58,930
Yeah! Whoo!
I want you
to prepare

00:25:58,997 --> 00:26:00,198
to jump!

00:26:00,265 --> 00:26:02,333
Without a parachute?

00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,735
That's my stunt?!

00:26:03,802 --> 00:26:05,036
No way!
Dude,

00:26:05,103 --> 00:26:07,572
the name of the show is
"Going All the Way."

00:26:07,639 --> 00:26:09,374
You signed a contract.
Now, do it!

00:26:09,441 --> 00:26:11,876
Jumping out of chopper's
not going all the way--

00:26:11,943 --> 00:26:13,478
it's suicide!
Listen, man,

00:26:13,545 --> 00:26:14,879
you don't have a choice, Kevin.

00:26:14,946 --> 00:26:16,047
You already ate raw meat,

00:26:16,114 --> 00:26:17,348
you stuck your face
in a beehive.

00:26:17,415 --> 00:26:19,317
You don't go all the way,
you don't get nothing!

00:26:19,384 --> 00:26:20,652
Come on, Kevin!
No!

00:26:20,718 --> 00:26:21,886
( <i>laughs</i> )
What are
you doing?!

00:26:21,953 --> 00:26:23,021
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

00:26:23,087 --> 00:26:24,923
Dude, dude, check this out,
get a shot of this.

00:26:24,989 --> 00:26:26,191
Get his crotch.
Get his crotch.

00:26:26,257 --> 00:26:27,358
Come here.
( <i>grunting</i> )

00:26:27,425 --> 00:26:31,196
Our first contestant
peed his pants.

00:26:31,262 --> 00:26:33,298
Re-a-li-ty!
Come on, let go!

00:26:33,364 --> 00:26:35,500
You can't fake this.
Now, Kevin...

00:26:35,567 --> 00:26:36,935
Go, baby!
( <i>yells</i> )

00:26:37,001 --> 00:26:38,136
( <i>yells</i> )

00:26:38,203 --> 00:26:39,971
( <i>man laughing</i> )

00:26:40,038 --> 00:26:41,940
Keep going, keep going.

00:26:42,006 --> 00:26:43,374
But here's the thing.

00:26:43,441 --> 00:26:45,210
We're only four feet up.

00:26:45,276 --> 00:26:46,544
Joke's on him.

00:26:46,611 --> 00:26:47,912
Let's check it out.

00:26:47,979 --> 00:26:50,048
Kevin! Kevin!

00:26:51,749 --> 00:26:53,585
He's not moving.

00:26:53,651 --> 00:26:55,587
Turn off the camera.
Turn off the camera! Turn...

00:26:55,653 --> 00:26:58,289
Kevin thought that
he was being pushed
out of a helicopter

00:26:58,356 --> 00:26:59,924
a thousand feet
in the air, but...

00:26:59,991 --> 00:27:02,093
See you later, Kevin!
( <i>yells</i> )

00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,295
Hey, Kevin?

00:27:04,362 --> 00:27:06,564
He's not moving.

00:27:09,033 --> 00:27:11,069
Come on, let's get out of here!

00:27:13,538 --> 00:27:15,140
Did you have a warrant
for that tape?

00:27:15,206 --> 00:27:16,775
WILLOWS:
The pilot gave us the name

00:27:16,841 --> 00:27:19,110
of the cameraman, who supplied
the tape voluntarily.

00:27:19,177 --> 00:27:21,379
Look, I assured Kevin
all our stunts were safe.

00:27:21,446 --> 00:27:23,214
And they were.

00:27:23,281 --> 00:27:25,784
Besides, he signed a waiver;
I'm not guilty of anything.

00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:27,919
When you saw that
he wasn't moving,

00:27:27,986 --> 00:27:29,721
you just took off.

00:27:29,788 --> 00:27:31,456
That sounds like
guilt to me.

00:27:31,523 --> 00:27:33,324
STOKES:
You scared him
to death.

00:27:33,391 --> 00:27:34,692
He had a heart attack.

00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:36,327
So the signing of a waiver

00:27:36,394 --> 00:27:38,396
doesn't make it
any less criminal.

00:27:38,463 --> 00:27:40,665
WILLOWS:
When the jury
sees that tape,

00:27:40,732 --> 00:27:42,667
you'll be going all the way...

00:27:42,734 --> 00:27:44,002
to jail.

00:27:44,068 --> 00:27:45,837
Second-degree murder.

00:27:45,904 --> 00:27:49,441
25 to life.

00:27:55,313 --> 00:27:57,482
I hope this is a fire drill.
Conrad.

00:27:57,549 --> 00:27:59,918
We found our body.

00:27:59,984 --> 00:28:02,954
Looks more like
he found us.

00:28:10,417 --> 00:28:12,793
Doc, I want you to
process the body ASAP.

00:28:12,793 --> 00:28:13,894
Yeah, Conrad,

00:28:13,961 --> 00:28:15,596
I'll get right on it.

00:28:15,663 --> 00:28:18,532
Ah, yes-- the guy we
left on the bench.

00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:19,734
Right.

00:28:21,035 --> 00:28:23,104
Hello, Conrad.

00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:25,072
I thought
you were in court.
We had

00:28:25,139 --> 00:28:27,667
a one-hour recess--
I'm on my way back now.

00:28:27,667 --> 00:28:29,702
And this must be Mr. Billmeyer.

00:28:29,769 --> 00:28:31,537
I'm so glad he's back.

00:28:31,604 --> 00:28:33,206
Very funny.

00:28:33,272 --> 00:28:35,908
You might want to have
Hodges analyze that cigar.

00:28:35,975 --> 00:28:37,910
Oh, and the print tech is free.

00:28:37,977 --> 00:28:41,114
He could, uh,
spray the party hat
with ninhydrin.

00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:45,952
I think I remember how to do
my job, Gil, thank you.

00:28:46,018 --> 00:28:48,821
I love it when you
wear your gloves.

00:28:55,728 --> 00:28:58,197
I swear, I don't know
how that hole got there.

00:28:58,264 --> 00:28:59,365
And if you think
that I had

00:28:59,432 --> 00:29:02,001
anything to do with
Trip's death, you're wrong.

00:29:02,735 --> 00:29:04,404
I was in L.A.
for four days.

00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:07,840
I had just gotten
back, and I saw Susan
banging on his door.

00:29:09,008 --> 00:29:10,743
Trip, are you in there?
Open up.

00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:13,045
If you can hear me,
open the door. Please?

00:29:13,112 --> 00:29:14,280
Hey, are you all right?

00:29:14,347 --> 00:29:17,016
Yeah, Trip missed a game.
I thought something's wrong.

00:29:17,083 --> 00:29:18,184
Trip?

00:29:18,251 --> 00:29:21,554
Hey, man, we're coming in.

00:29:21,621 --> 00:29:24,690
Can anyone verify
that you were in L.A.?

00:29:24,757 --> 00:29:26,692
The whole dorm can verify it.

00:29:27,994 --> 00:29:30,663
I was visiting my boyfriend.
It was his birthday.

00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:33,066
We went to the auto show.
Does anyone else

00:29:33,132 --> 00:29:34,700
have access to your room?

00:29:34,767 --> 00:29:36,569
No, I've got the only key,
but like I said,

00:29:36,636 --> 00:29:38,438
it's easy enough
to break in.

00:29:38,504 --> 00:29:40,306
SIDLE:
What happened to your finger?

00:29:40,373 --> 00:29:42,075
I'm not sure.

00:29:42,141 --> 00:29:45,044
I had just gotten
back from my trip,
and I saw something

00:29:45,111 --> 00:29:46,612
on the floor,
so I picked it up.

00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:48,314
It kind of burned me
or something.

00:29:48,381 --> 00:29:49,549
And that

00:29:49,615 --> 00:29:51,884
didn't seem weird to you?

00:29:51,951 --> 00:29:52,952
I'm in college.

00:29:53,019 --> 00:29:54,921
A lot of things
seem weird to me.

00:29:54,987 --> 00:29:57,256
Okay.

00:29:57,323 --> 00:30:01,260
This thing...
that burned your finger,

00:30:01,327 --> 00:30:03,062
where is it now?
I tossed it.

00:30:04,397 --> 00:30:05,932
Excuse me.

00:30:13,906 --> 00:30:16,576
I don't see anything
but a couple pieces

00:30:16,642 --> 00:30:19,278
of balled up paper
and a soda can.

00:30:19,345 --> 00:30:21,647
Nothing incendiary.
It was there.

00:30:21,714 --> 00:30:23,282
I don't know what
to tell you, man.

00:30:23,349 --> 00:30:25,418
All right, Zack,
we are <i>not</i>

00:30:25,485 --> 00:30:26,986
going to take you
into custody,

00:30:27,053 --> 00:30:29,956
but we <i>are</i> going to need
access to your room

00:30:30,022 --> 00:30:31,958
for the rest of the day.
Okay.

00:30:32,024 --> 00:30:33,393
I'm late for
Ancient History.

00:30:33,459 --> 00:30:34,694
Can I go?
Sure.

00:30:34,761 --> 00:30:37,196
And this, uh,
this nice officer...

00:30:37,263 --> 00:30:39,198
he's gonna be your
"study buddy."

00:30:39,265 --> 00:30:41,401
Thanks.

00:30:43,936 --> 00:30:45,738
Well, what are
you thinking?

00:30:45,805 --> 00:30:48,875
Name a chemical compound
that can burn skin

00:30:48,941 --> 00:30:51,043
and can also disappear
into thin air.

00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:53,946
The only thing I can think of
is dry ice.

00:30:54,013 --> 00:30:56,816
And dry ice releases
carbon dioxide

00:30:56,883 --> 00:30:58,484
as it sublimates.

00:30:58,551 --> 00:31:01,154
Yeah, but can you put
enough dry ice

00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,989
in Zack's room to
raise the amount

00:31:03,056 --> 00:31:05,525
of carbon dioxide in Trip's room
to a lethal level?

00:31:05,591 --> 00:31:07,960
Is that a dare?

00:31:36,875 --> 00:31:38,834
Level's only 1.2.

00:31:38,834 --> 00:31:41,337
We need more dry ice.

00:32:02,917 --> 00:32:04,619
It took 30 pounds
of dry ice

00:32:04,686 --> 00:32:06,554
to reach the lethal
level of saturation.

00:32:06,621 --> 00:32:08,923
On the floor,
where the sleeping bag was.

00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:12,327
Carbon dioxide is one and half
times heavier than air.

00:32:12,393 --> 00:32:14,429
You know,
it's conceivable

00:32:14,495 --> 00:32:16,097
that if Trip and Paula
had been sleeping

00:32:16,164 --> 00:32:17,765
in his bed,
they might still be alive.

00:32:17,832 --> 00:32:19,701
I think I know why
the bodies turned pink.

00:32:19,767 --> 00:32:20,902
Really?

00:32:20,968 --> 00:32:22,537
Dry ice is cold.

00:32:22,603 --> 00:32:23,705
The dry ice significantly

00:32:23,771 --> 00:32:25,306
lowered the temperature
in both rooms,

00:32:25,373 --> 00:32:26,908
and the drastic decrease
in temperature

00:32:26,974 --> 00:32:28,409
can turn a dead body pink.

00:32:28,476 --> 00:32:29,877
We see it all the time

00:32:29,944 --> 00:32:31,846
when we pull dead bodies
from frozen rivers.

00:32:31,913 --> 00:32:33,014
Nice, Greg.

00:32:33,081 --> 00:32:34,782
You know, if Zachary
is telling

00:32:34,849 --> 00:32:37,085
the truth, and he simply
burned his finger

00:32:37,151 --> 00:32:42,256
on a remnant of dry ice,
who put it there?

00:32:42,323 --> 00:32:45,226
I'll have P.D. run a credit card
check on everyone in the dorm,

00:32:45,293 --> 00:32:48,930
see if anyone recently purchased
a large quantity of dry ice.

00:32:48,997 --> 00:32:51,933
Your decedent smells
like a pine tree.

00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,769
Whoever stole him
probably sprayed his body

00:32:54,836 --> 00:32:57,438
with disinfectant
to cover up the stench.

00:32:57,505 --> 00:32:58,573
You got cause of death?

00:32:58,639 --> 00:33:00,141
Yeah, he died of a heavy heart.

00:33:01,109 --> 00:33:03,411
Heart weighed
500 grams instead of 300.

00:33:03,478 --> 00:33:04,712
Hypertensive

00:33:04,779 --> 00:33:06,280
Cardiovascular disease.

00:33:06,347 --> 00:33:08,149
So his heart stopped,
he keeled over,

00:33:08,216 --> 00:33:09,484
hit his head on the pavement.

00:33:17,392 --> 00:33:19,560
Do you think he was aware
of his condition?

00:33:19,627 --> 00:33:20,928
Oh, I know he was.

00:33:20,995 --> 00:33:22,797
I sent blood to Tox,

00:33:22,864 --> 00:33:24,165
he was taking
Atenolol.

00:33:24,232 --> 00:33:26,334
A heart that size,
he was a walking time bomb.

00:33:26,401 --> 00:33:27,335
Anything else?

00:33:27,402 --> 00:33:30,638
Yup, our guy chugged a beer,
after he died.

00:33:30,705 --> 00:33:32,140
Lungs were full

00:33:32,206 --> 00:33:33,574
of foam.

00:33:33,641 --> 00:33:35,510
So somebody poured it
down his throat?

00:33:35,576 --> 00:33:36,444
Wouldn't be my postmortem

00:33:36,511 --> 00:33:38,112
beverage of choice,
but to each his own.

00:33:38,179 --> 00:33:40,748
So did you get any prints
off that cooler drawer?

00:33:40,815 --> 00:33:42,316
Three.

00:33:42,383 --> 00:33:45,086
Two were yours,
one was David's.

00:33:45,153 --> 00:33:46,821
See you later.

00:34:28,930 --> 00:34:30,031
Anything?

00:34:30,041 --> 00:34:32,458
Just so you know, I moved
all your trace evidence

00:34:32,458 --> 00:34:33,926
up to the top
of my pile.

00:34:33,993 --> 00:34:34,994
Well, thank you.

00:34:35,061 --> 00:34:36,195
Why don't you quit
blowing smoke

00:34:36,262 --> 00:34:37,396
and tell me about
the cigar?

00:34:37,463 --> 00:34:40,599
Low in nicotine,
high in furfural.

00:34:40,666 --> 00:34:42,501
I compared it to other
tobacco samples

00:34:42,568 --> 00:34:43,969
from the Exemplar collection.

00:34:44,036 --> 00:34:46,572
It's consistent with
the Perdomo Reserve brand.

00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,841
I took the liberty
of calling a cigar society.

00:34:48,908 --> 00:34:50,776
They referred me
to the Vegas distributor.

00:34:50,843 --> 00:34:52,912
Spoke to him directly.

00:34:52,978 --> 00:34:55,114
Perdomos are very
high-end.

00:34:55,181 --> 00:34:57,283
He only made one sale
this past month.

00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:59,085
It was to a guy
in Seven Hills.

00:34:59,151 --> 00:35:01,053
Smells like
my grandfather.

00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,122
Am I interrupting?

00:35:03,189 --> 00:35:04,256
Actually, yeah.

00:35:04,323 --> 00:35:06,625
Conrad was about
to pat me on the back.

00:35:06,692 --> 00:35:09,762
What do you got for me, Neil?

00:35:09,829 --> 00:35:11,831
NEIL:
Lifted four clear prints
from the party hat.

00:35:11,897 --> 00:35:13,899
They all came back
to Preston Hayburn,

00:35:13,966 --> 00:35:15,601
from Henderson.

00:35:15,668 --> 00:35:16,869
He's a paramedic.

00:35:16,936 --> 00:35:18,671
Would've had access
to the morgue.

00:35:18,738 --> 00:35:19,872
Good work, Neil.

00:35:19,939 --> 00:35:21,073
Good work.

00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:21,907
I have a number.

00:35:21,974 --> 00:35:22,775
Oh, me, too.

00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:26,979
The woman he met on the plane

00:35:27,046 --> 00:35:29,148
said he was heading
to party in Seven Hills.

00:35:29,215 --> 00:35:31,317
I'll start there
and then I'll head to Henderson.

00:35:31,384 --> 00:35:32,284
Okay?

00:35:32,351 --> 00:35:34,520
Yes.

00:35:38,391 --> 00:35:40,693
I found this toilet behind
my apartment complex.

00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,329
It's, uh, volunteered
for an experiment.

00:35:43,396 --> 00:35:44,230
It's moving.

00:35:44,296 --> 00:35:45,865
I put dry ice
in the bowl.

00:35:45,931 --> 00:35:47,266
So you're thinking
that the killer

00:35:47,333 --> 00:35:49,835
might have put his excess
dry ice in the dorm toilet.

00:35:49,902 --> 00:35:51,003
When the ice
was flushed,

00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:52,505
it would've lodged
in the drain trap.

00:35:52,571 --> 00:35:54,740
As the ice sublimated
and gas was released,

00:35:54,807 --> 00:35:55,975
it would've built up,

00:35:56,042 --> 00:35:57,676
causing the toilet
to explode.

00:35:57,743 --> 00:35:58,911
Good theory.

00:35:58,978 --> 00:36:00,379
I spoke with Brass.

00:36:00,446 --> 00:36:02,381
Zack's alibi checks out.

00:36:02,448 --> 00:36:04,350
He was in L.A. all week.

00:36:04,417 --> 00:36:09,021
And, uh, P.D. checked
credit card records.

00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:11,357
No one in that dorm
bought dry ice on credit.

00:36:11,424 --> 00:36:12,925
There's only two retail outlets

00:36:12,992 --> 00:36:15,961
in 20 miles that sell it,
and no one's

00:36:16,028 --> 00:36:17,630
purchased a large
quantity of dry ice

00:36:17,697 --> 00:36:18,698
in the last few weeks.

00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,902
( <i>laughing</i> )

00:36:22,968 --> 00:36:26,672
Well, I think I explained
the explod-o-potty.

00:36:26,739 --> 00:36:28,574
Gregg, maybe the dry ice
wasn't purchased.

00:36:28,641 --> 00:36:30,643
I mean, we are looking
at a university.

00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:32,244
Science department
would probably

00:36:32,311 --> 00:36:33,746
keep the stuff on hand.

00:36:33,813 --> 00:36:35,715
Science major would have access.

00:36:35,781 --> 00:36:38,217
I was his R.A.

00:36:38,284 --> 00:36:40,619
The guy lived for basketball,
beer and girls.

00:36:40,686 --> 00:36:43,322
Didn't want much to do
with dorm activities.

00:36:43,389 --> 00:36:46,792
Have you... seen
this before?

00:36:47,927 --> 00:36:49,562
No.

00:36:49,628 --> 00:36:54,200
Trip kept record of his, uh,
relationships with women.

00:36:54,266 --> 00:36:56,402
Your name is in here.

00:36:56,469 --> 00:36:59,004
Three times.

00:36:59,071 --> 00:37:00,940
On, uh, February 2nd,

00:37:01,006 --> 00:37:02,708
you hooked up
for the first time.

00:37:02,775 --> 00:37:05,044
Looks like second base.

00:37:05,111 --> 00:37:06,879
On February 9th,

00:37:06,946 --> 00:37:09,081
you rounded third,

00:37:09,148 --> 00:37:12,518
and on February 18th,

00:37:12,585 --> 00:37:14,053
he got
a grand slam.

00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,654
He wrote that down?

00:37:15,721 --> 00:37:17,056
Mm-hmm.

00:37:21,875 --> 00:37:24,110
We had sex, I admit it.

00:37:24,177 --> 00:37:25,345
No big deal.

00:37:25,412 --> 00:37:26,579
I didn't tell you guys

00:37:26,646 --> 00:37:28,615
because I'm not
exactly proud of it, okay?

00:37:28,681 --> 00:37:30,183
Trip and Paula
died

00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:31,918
from of carbon dioxide gas.

00:37:31,985 --> 00:37:34,421
We already know
that you have access

00:37:34,487 --> 00:37:36,189
to dry ice, and as

00:37:36,256 --> 00:37:37,657
a materials science
grad student,

00:37:37,724 --> 00:37:40,693
you are familiar
with the chemical properties.

00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,095
This is crazy.

00:37:42,162 --> 00:37:43,329
Last week,
you checked out

00:37:43,396 --> 00:37:45,532
40 pounds
of dry ice

00:37:45,598 --> 00:37:47,667
from the campus lab.

00:37:47,734 --> 00:37:48,802
My thesis is on metallurgy.

00:37:48,868 --> 00:37:50,236
I use dry ice to test

00:37:50,303 --> 00:37:51,638
the physical constrains
of certain metals.

00:37:51,704 --> 00:37:53,006
I also spoke
to your advisor

00:37:53,073 --> 00:37:55,375
who told me that your
experiments require

00:37:55,442 --> 00:37:58,344
two pounds of dry ice, at most.

00:38:01,581 --> 00:38:03,650
He broke your heart.

00:38:03,716 --> 00:38:05,118
He led you on,

00:38:05,185 --> 00:38:07,487
he let you believe
it was serious,

00:38:07,554 --> 00:38:11,191
and after you went
all the way,

00:38:11,257 --> 00:38:13,560
you were history.

00:38:13,626 --> 00:38:17,464
Look, this has been a wild ride,
but if I gave you the impression

00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:18,732
that I want
a relationship,

00:38:18,798 --> 00:38:20,233
then, uh...

00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,835
I was an idiot.

00:38:24,237 --> 00:38:26,539
I had been consulting
my female advisees

00:38:26,606 --> 00:38:28,742
not to take that kind of crap.

00:38:28,808 --> 00:38:30,143
You knew Zack was in L.A.,

00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:32,245
so you broke into his room
during the day

00:38:32,312 --> 00:38:33,947
and drilled a hole in the wall.

00:38:41,321 --> 00:38:43,089
Later that night,

00:38:43,156 --> 00:38:44,090
you returned.

00:38:55,668 --> 00:39:00,340
SANDERS:
<i>Trip and Paula were asleep,</i>
 <i>passed out from the alcohol.</i>

00:39:00,407 --> 00:39:01,941
<i>When the ice evaporated,</i>

00:39:02,008 --> 00:39:06,112
<i>the gas engulfed the room,</i>
<i>killing them.</i>

00:39:06,179 --> 00:39:08,548
I didn't know Paula was there,
and I never meant to kill Trip.

00:39:08,615 --> 00:39:09,716
So drilling
the hole

00:39:09,783 --> 00:39:11,651
in the wall and leaving
the ice behind was an accident?

00:39:11,718 --> 00:39:12,719
No, no, look.

00:39:12,786 --> 00:39:14,754
Trip's room
is 16 feet by nine feet.

00:39:14,821 --> 00:39:18,958
I used exactly the right amount
of ice just to make him sick.

00:39:19,025 --> 00:39:20,960
If he had been in
the bed three feet

00:39:21,027 --> 00:39:23,229
above the ground
and not on the floor...

00:39:23,296 --> 00:39:26,332
I just wanted him
to miss his basketball game.

00:39:28,468 --> 00:39:31,204
Trip only slept on the floor
when he had girls over,

00:39:31,271 --> 00:39:33,840
and he never had sex
before a big game.

00:39:33,907 --> 00:39:36,843
He shouldn't have been
on the floor.

00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:39,946
Your science
was perfect,

00:39:40,013 --> 00:39:43,116
your instincts were not so good.

00:39:43,183 --> 00:39:44,984
And you
miscalculated

00:39:45,051 --> 00:39:47,454
one huge factor:

00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:51,624
the sex drive of a college jock.

00:39:51,691 --> 00:39:53,927
( <i>door bell chimes</i> )

00:39:53,993 --> 00:39:55,695
Who is it?

00:39:55,762 --> 00:39:57,831
( <i>through door</i> ):
L.V.P.D.

00:40:05,705 --> 00:40:06,740
Can I help you?

00:40:06,806 --> 00:40:08,125
Are you Charlie Jackson?

00:40:08,125 --> 00:40:08,834
Yeah.

00:40:08,834 --> 00:40:09,902
Do you know a James Billmeyer?

00:40:09,969 --> 00:40:12,542
Yeah, we went
to high school together.

00:40:12,542 --> 00:40:13,375
Are you aware that he

00:40:13,375 --> 00:40:13,959
passed away?

00:40:13,959 --> 00:40:17,709
Yeah, yeah, it was a big blow;
we were close.

00:40:17,709 --> 00:40:19,310
You mind
if we come in?

00:40:20,678 --> 00:40:22,346
Yeah, come in.

00:40:33,124 --> 00:40:35,293
You, uh...

00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:39,097
smoke Perdomo
Reserve?

00:40:39,163 --> 00:40:41,866
Yeah, on special
occasion.

00:40:41,933 --> 00:40:43,901
Why?

00:40:43,968 --> 00:40:45,703
Do you know a Preston Hayburn?

00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:47,338
Paramedic
from Henderson.

00:40:47,405 --> 00:40:49,340
Yeah, he,
James and I were tight.

00:40:49,407 --> 00:40:51,743
We went to high school together.
What's this about?

00:40:51,809 --> 00:40:52,977
Cut the act,
Charlie.

00:40:53,044 --> 00:40:54,078
We know
that Preston

00:40:54,145 --> 00:40:55,380
had access to the morgue.

00:40:55,446 --> 00:40:57,181
We believe he stole
James Billmeyer's body,

00:40:57,248 --> 00:40:58,316
maybe brought it here.

00:40:58,383 --> 00:41:00,184
But what we don't know is why?

00:41:04,889 --> 00:41:06,090
All right, James was dying.

00:41:06,157 --> 00:41:07,825
He had a bad heart,
everybody knew it,

00:41:07,892 --> 00:41:10,895
so we flew him
out here for one last bash,

00:41:10,962 --> 00:41:14,165
and Preston got called to the
Tangiers and it was Jamie.

00:41:14,232 --> 00:41:16,401
The poor guy
died in the parking lot.

00:41:16,467 --> 00:41:17,668
ECKLIE:
And then what?

00:41:17,735 --> 00:41:19,737
You decided to throw him
a dead man's party?

00:41:19,804 --> 00:41:22,240
Well, we already
bought the booze.

00:41:22,306 --> 00:41:25,109
( <i>laughing</i> )

00:41:25,176 --> 00:41:28,946
( <i>indistinct conversations</i> )

00:41:29,013 --> 00:41:33,484
( <i>laughing</i> )

00:41:38,589 --> 00:41:40,625
He was my best friend, you know?

00:41:40,692 --> 00:41:42,794
It's a class D felony
to steal a corpse

00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:44,595
with the intent

00:41:44,662 --> 00:41:45,863
to sell or mutilate.

00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:47,865
I'm not really sure
how to classify

00:41:47,932 --> 00:41:49,100
"partying with the dead."

00:41:49,167 --> 00:41:50,635
Look, I know
how it looks,

00:41:50,702 --> 00:41:52,970
but if you knew Jamie...

00:41:53,037 --> 00:41:55,073
it's what he would've wanted.

00:41:55,139 --> 00:41:56,792
And we did return him.

00:41:56,792 --> 00:41:58,542
You're still
under arrest.

00:41:58,542 --> 00:42:01,512
Obstruction of justice and
conspiracy to commit theft.

00:42:01,579 --> 00:42:04,148
You're looking at
one to four years, Charlie.

00:42:07,318 --> 00:42:10,355
He would have done it for me.
