Hey, Gil, just wanted
to hear your voice.

00:00:26,176 --> 00:00:28,211
It's kind of a slow night here.

00:00:28,211 --> 00:00:30,547
Give me a call

WOMAN (on video): It's crazy!
All these lights--no wonder

00:01:18,228 --> 00:01:21,064
you can see this place
from space.

00:01:21,064 --> 00:01:23,200
Oh, my God!
Did you see that?

00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,402
(video turns off)

00:01:25,402 --> 00:01:27,404
This was shot
about 40 minutes ago,

00:01:27,404 --> 00:01:29,406
right before
a charter aircraft

00:01:29,406 --> 00:01:31,308
nosed into the ground
at Tresser Park.

00:01:31,308 --> 00:01:32,876
That's just a mile
off the Strip.

00:01:32,876 --> 00:01:35,545
This is NTSB investigator
Doug Wilson.

00:01:35,545 --> 00:01:37,814
He's gonna be leading
the crash investigation.

00:01:37,814 --> 00:01:39,916
You-you two guys
worked together before, right?

00:01:39,916 --> 00:01:41,084
Yeah.
Yeah.

00:01:41,084 --> 00:01:43,053
On an NTSB crash scene

00:01:43,053 --> 00:01:44,988
when I worked
at the San Francisco Crime Lab.

00:01:44,988 --> 00:01:47,190
Right now, we have
very little information.

00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,525
Where did the flight
originate?

00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,460
LV Regional Airport,
heading for Chicago.

00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,162
18 minutes out,
the pilot reported

00:01:52,162 --> 00:01:55,198
an unspecified emergency,
turned the plane around,

00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:57,534
and after that, radio silence.
RUSSELL:
From the moment

00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,970
it turned around,
made a beeline for the Strip.

00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,972
And almost, as you
just saw, slammed

00:02:01,972 --> 00:02:03,440
into the Mediterranean
Casino Tower,

00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,275
missing it
by about half a dozen feet.

00:02:05,275 --> 00:02:07,110
So you're thinking
this wasn't an accident?

00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,578
I'm not sure.

00:02:08,578 --> 00:02:11,348
But it's certainly a mystery
why the pilot

00:02:11,348 --> 00:02:13,016
stopped communicating
with the tower,

00:02:13,016 --> 00:02:15,085
why the plane nose-dived
near the Strip,

00:02:15,085 --> 00:02:17,287
what happened
on that plane.

00:02:17,287 --> 00:02:19,222
All questions
we need answers to.

00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:23,093
Answers we're hoping you CSIs
can provide through evidence.

00:02:23,093 --> 00:02:24,394
RUSSELL:
So, was it
an accident

00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:25,962
or foul play?

00:02:25,962 --> 00:02:27,464
This is what we need
to find out.

Sounds agitated.
FINLAY:
Yeah.

00:03:24,054 --> 00:03:25,422
Could be a hijacker.
So far, we've

00:03:25,422 --> 00:03:27,424
only found one body
in the cockpit wreckage.

00:03:27,424 --> 00:03:29,226
It's got to be the pilot.

Well, we also found
additional remains.

00:03:34,898 --> 00:03:36,466
How many bodies?
Can't say.

00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,201
With a charter plane this size,

00:03:38,201 --> 00:03:40,370
there's no requirement
for a passenger manifest.

00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:42,272
As for how many were on
the aircraft and who,

00:03:42,272 --> 00:03:44,141
well, we're gonna need
your help with that.

00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:47,144

Morgan and Greg are heading out
to collect personal effects.

00:03:55,118 --> 00:03:57,087
Could help
with identifications.
Right.

00:03:57,087 --> 00:03:59,389
What about the black box?
Still haven't
recovered it.

00:03:59,389 --> 00:04:03,059
Was about to head back to the
site; could use some help.

00:04:03,059 --> 00:04:04,995

together before--you probably

00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:06,863
have your own shorthand.
It's a good idea.

00:04:06,863 --> 00:04:08,131
All right,
let's get to work.

00:04:08,131 --> 00:04:09,332
Lot of eyes on this.

00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,368

Thank you.

Oh, 'cause you're
scared of going

00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,941
more than 20 miles per hour?

00:04:17,941 --> 00:04:20,544
Hojem-Sanders!
I was hoping I'd see you!

00:04:20,544 --> 00:04:22,112
Hey, Donna.

00:04:22,112 --> 00:04:24,014
What are you doing here?
Are you looking for me?

00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:25,549
Me, actually.

00:04:25,549 --> 00:04:28,151
Which means you
must be Morgan Brody.

00:04:28,151 --> 00:04:30,187
Yes. Hi. I am so sorry.
We just got a call out,

00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:32,122
and I completely forgot
about our appointment.

00:04:32,122 --> 00:04:33,323
Appointment?

00:04:33,323 --> 00:04:34,558
How do you two...?

00:04:34,558 --> 00:04:36,359
Doc Robbins
recommended Donna.

00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,562
He was blown away
by your genealogy
work on his family.

00:04:38,562 --> 00:04:41,398
You said on the
phone that you had some
family history for me?

00:04:41,398 --> 00:04:43,266
I did, and it's
on my desk.

00:04:43,266 --> 00:04:44,834
But...
I'm so sorry,

00:04:44,834 --> 00:04:46,436
we have to get to a crime scene.

00:04:46,436 --> 00:04:48,405
Oh, that's all right.
You go do what you have to do,

00:04:48,405 --> 00:04:50,106
and I'll work here.

00:04:50,106 --> 00:04:52,142
Believe me, there's
a lot of Brodys out there.

00:04:52,142 --> 00:04:54,311
Oh, Brody's actually
my stepfather's last name.

00:04:54,311 --> 00:04:55,812
I'm interested in Ecklie.

00:04:55,812 --> 00:04:57,314
Oh, your biological
father. Of course.

00:04:57,314 --> 00:04:59,082
Don't tell me.

00:04:59,082 --> 00:05:01,418
You still trying to prove
he's not your dad?
(laughs)

00:05:01,418 --> 00:05:03,353
Uh, just kidding.

00:05:03,353 --> 00:05:04,988
Christmas is coming,

00:05:04,988 --> 00:05:07,257
and I want to get my dad
something special,

00:05:07,257 --> 00:05:09,359
so I thought maybe
a family crest.

00:05:09,359 --> 00:05:11,094
How wonderful. Okay.

00:05:11,094 --> 00:05:12,929
You go do your thing,
and I'll get to work here.

00:05:12,929 --> 00:05:14,364

Thanks.

00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,337
Ready to roll?
Just about.

00:05:20,337 --> 00:05:22,005
Just like old times, right?

00:05:22,005 --> 00:05:23,540
(laughs)

00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,342
<i>Very</i> old times.

00:05:25,342 --> 00:05:26,943
Heard you, uh,
married your boss.

00:05:26,943 --> 00:05:28,144
What's his name again?

00:05:28,144 --> 00:05:29,346
Gil.

00:05:29,346 --> 00:05:31,548
Right. Grissom. Bug guy.

00:05:31,548 --> 00:05:33,216
You still married
to what's-her-name?

00:05:33,216 --> 00:05:36,219
Candy?
Candy, right.
Yoga instructor.

00:05:36,219 --> 00:05:39,289
No, no, we...crashed
and burned years ago.

00:05:39,289 --> 00:05:40,890
Yeah, I didn't see that coming.

00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,092
Yeah, you did.

00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:44,227
Just like old times.

00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:50,200
Hey, Doc.
How's it going?
Hey.

00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,434
What do you
got for me?

00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:52,836
On the left gurney

00:05:52,836 --> 00:05:54,537
are the remains
from the cockpit.

00:05:54,537 --> 00:05:57,240
In front of me
and on the right,

00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,176
remains recovered
from the passenger cabin area.

00:06:00,176 --> 00:06:01,444
PHILLIPS:
And we ran DNA

00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:03,146
on a small sample
of those remains.

00:06:03,146 --> 00:06:04,848
Turns out
we have one Jane

00:06:04,848 --> 00:06:06,316
and two John Does.
So in addition

00:06:06,316 --> 00:06:08,251
to what I assume
is our pilot,

00:06:08,251 --> 00:06:10,487
we have three
unidentified passengers.

00:06:11,855 --> 00:06:14,524
(whirring)

00:06:14,524 --> 00:06:16,493

Looks like I've got
something here.

00:06:16,493 --> 00:06:18,161
Take a look.

00:06:18,161 --> 00:06:20,830
ROBBINS:
Looks like a T-10
or T-11 vertebra.

00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:23,066
What's that?
Part of the fuselage?

00:06:23,066 --> 00:06:24,467
David, hand me
that, would you?

00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,970
Yeah.

00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,105
Hmm, looks like shrapnel.

00:06:29,105 --> 00:06:30,540
Surrounding tissue appears

00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:33,109
deteriorated--
this guy was in pain.

00:06:33,109 --> 00:06:34,944
And over a long period of time.

00:06:34,944 --> 00:06:36,146
Just a second.

00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:37,347

00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,052
Radioactive?

00:06:42,052 --> 00:06:43,320
As I suspected.

00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,488
I think
I know how we

00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:48,425
can identify
at least this victim.

00:06:48,425 --> 00:06:50,360

We're here investigating
the crash.

00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:08,978
Crime lab?
I don't understand.

00:07:08,978 --> 00:07:10,413
What happened was
an accident, right?

00:07:10,413 --> 00:07:12,248
STOKES:
Well, that's
why we're here.

00:07:12,248 --> 00:07:14,551
There was no passenger manifest
filed for the flight, so...

00:07:14,551 --> 00:07:17,320
'Cause Keith was
flying solo--VFR.

00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,389

That's impossible--
Keith was alone.

00:07:25,295 --> 00:07:26,930
Told me he was
flying home

00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:29,165

00:07:29,165 --> 00:07:31,434

00:07:34,804 --> 00:07:37,307
on your plane
without you knowing?

00:07:37,307 --> 00:07:39,809
Keith and I are
business partners.

00:07:39,809 --> 00:07:42,245
We each focus on different
aspects of the company.

00:07:42,245 --> 00:07:44,214
Normally, I do
the booking,

00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:47,517
but obviously he must've booked
some passengers on his own.

00:07:47,517 --> 00:07:49,252
Why are you asking me
all these questions?

00:07:49,252 --> 00:07:51,020
Is there something
you're not telling me?

00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,889
When you say Keith
was your business partner,

00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,324
how well did you know him?

00:07:57,127 --> 00:07:58,928
Well, it's not any
of your business,

00:07:58,928 --> 00:08:01,131
but we were a couple.

00:08:01,131 --> 00:08:03,400
We were together
for the last 15 years.

00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,268
So if it seems

00:08:05,268 --> 00:08:08,538
like I'm not in the mood
to talk right now, you're right.

00:08:08,538 --> 00:08:10,340
We're really sorry
for your loss.

00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,841
We do need to confirm

00:08:11,841 --> 00:08:13,910
that one of the bodies
that we found

00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,879
was indeed Keith's.

00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:18,581
STOKES: So, if you could
get us a toothbrush,

00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:22,452
a hairbrush, anything that
might have Keith's DNA on it,

00:08:22,452 --> 00:08:25,054
that'd be great, okay?

00:08:25,054 --> 00:08:26,990
Yeah, I'll get that to you.

00:08:30,493 --> 00:08:32,929
SANDERS:
Yeah, you're gonna love Donna.
She's awesome.

00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,165
She totally got me hooked
on genealogy.

00:08:35,165 --> 00:08:36,866
She seems cool.

00:08:36,866 --> 00:08:38,835
I found this mixed
with the personal effects.

00:08:38,835 --> 00:08:41,137
Take a look.
Looks like a section

00:08:41,137 --> 00:08:42,372
of airplane carpeting.

00:08:42,372 --> 00:08:44,974
Yup. Melted around something.

00:08:44,974 --> 00:08:47,110
Whoa, I got a gun.

00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,812
It could be our hijacker's.

00:08:48,812 --> 00:08:50,947
Can you hold this
open for me?

00:08:52,048 --> 00:08:53,216
(camera shutter clicks)

00:08:57,387 --> 00:08:59,889
Nine-millimeter Beretta,
receiver's torqued.

00:08:59,889 --> 00:09:01,057
Damage from the fire.

00:09:07,263 --> 00:09:09,199
Three rounds left
in the magazine.

00:09:09,199 --> 00:09:10,533
Someone could have fired it.

00:09:10,533 --> 00:09:12,268
And I think
we might know who.

00:09:12,268 --> 00:09:13,903
Shrapnel in one
of the victims

00:09:13,903 --> 00:09:16,239
turned out to contain
depleted uranium.

00:09:16,239 --> 00:09:17,907
You mean, like from
a battlefield?

00:09:17,907 --> 00:09:19,175
So the guy's a vet?

00:09:19,175 --> 00:09:20,543
Right, and the V.A.

00:09:20,543 --> 00:09:22,178
had X-rays on file

00:09:22,178 --> 00:09:24,380
matched to a Charles Harrigan.

00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,916
Made headlines last year,
when he got into a fight

00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:28,384
and got tossed out
of the Mediterranean.

00:09:28,384 --> 00:09:31,020
Yeah, he, uh, gambled away

00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,489
his home, his car,

00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:34,858
his wife--
he blamed the casino.

00:09:34,858 --> 00:09:37,260
Camped out in front
to keep people from going in.

00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,395
Maybe commandeering an airplane
and trying to crash it

00:09:39,395 --> 00:09:41,331
into the casino
was his form of revenge.

00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:43,199
That's what I'm thinking,
so let's run the gun,

00:09:43,199 --> 00:09:45,802
see if it traces
back to Harrigan.
All right.

00:09:49,973 --> 00:09:51,341
Flight data recorder's intact.

00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,109
Wish we had the cockpit
voice recorder too.

00:09:53,109 --> 00:09:54,577
Yeah, join the club.

00:09:54,577 --> 00:09:57,413
They're not required
for smaller charters.

00:09:57,413 --> 00:10:00,016
Hey, did you hear
that the Rusty Nickel closed?

00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:02,018
(laughs)
Well, that's about time.

00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,553
That bar gave dives
a bad name.

00:10:03,553 --> 00:10:05,522
What are you talking about?
You loved that place.

00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:07,457
Well, yeah, you're right,
I did love it, right up until

00:10:07,457 --> 00:10:09,993
the moment that they
kicked me out for life.
(clears throat)

00:10:09,993 --> 00:10:11,194
They did do that.
Yup.

00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:12,795
Okay, moving on.
So, we have

00:10:12,795 --> 00:10:14,497
the primary flight display up.

00:10:14,497 --> 00:10:17,100
SIDLE:
It should show us everything
on the instrument panel.

00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,370
17 minutes into the flight,
airspeed is 250 knots,

00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:23,039
altitude is 29,800 feet
and climbing,

00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,108
heading is 50 degrees--
all normal.

00:10:25,108 --> 00:10:27,110
Looks like there's a slight

00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:29,512
decrease in cabin pressure.

00:10:29,512 --> 00:10:31,281
Pilot's turning around,

00:10:31,281 --> 00:10:33,983
making a descent, looks
like he's putting in vectors

00:10:33,983 --> 00:10:35,785
to return to the airport.

00:10:35,785 --> 00:10:37,420
(alarm blares)

00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,055
What the hell just happened?

00:10:43,026 --> 00:10:45,528
WILSON:
<i>Massive depressurization.</i>
<i>30,000 feet,</i>

00:10:45,528 --> 00:10:49,032
<i>virtually no oxygen,</i>
<i>temperature is 34 below.</i>

00:10:49,032 --> 00:10:50,934
They were dead before
they even hit the ground.

00:10:50,934 --> 00:10:52,402
The plane just
kept going.

00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:53,836
Vector entries
kept it on course

00:10:53,836 --> 00:10:55,338
all the way to the ground.

00:10:55,338 --> 00:10:58,074
Barely missing
the Mediterranean Tower.
Mm-hmm.

00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,943
Why the depressurization?

00:10:59,943 --> 00:11:01,144
Gunshot, maybe.

00:11:01,144 --> 00:11:02,979
We know there was
a gun on board.

00:11:02,979 --> 00:11:05,181
A bullet hole alone wouldn't
trigger that kind of event.

00:11:05,181 --> 00:11:07,784
This was instantaneous,
catastrophic.
Like a bomb?

00:11:07,784 --> 00:11:09,886
Bomb would've taken out
the avionics and hydraulics.

00:11:09,886 --> 00:11:11,321
Plane wouldn't have
stayed on course.

00:11:11,321 --> 00:11:12,789
All right,
what's left, then?

00:11:12,789 --> 00:11:15,959
Uh, maybe a window
blew out, or a door.

00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:18,394
Whatever it is, it had
to fall to earth, right?

00:11:18,394 --> 00:11:19,929
Extrapolating
from their position

00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,431
at the time of depressurization

00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,533
and factoring in their
altitude and their velocity,

00:11:23,533 --> 00:11:26,469
I mean, I can zero in
on their location.

00:11:26,469 --> 00:11:28,838
Always the physics major.

00:11:28,838 --> 00:11:30,406
I tell you what,
I'm going to take my physics

00:11:30,406 --> 00:11:32,809
and I'm going to find whatever
fell out of your airplane.

00:11:32,809 --> 00:11:34,177
And what about me?
What do I do?

00:11:34,177 --> 00:11:35,845
Well, you're going
to build me a plane.

00:11:59,836 --> 00:12:02,171
WILSON:
Well, you found the door.

00:12:02,171 --> 00:12:04,140
Still don't know
what happened.
Let's go with

00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,375
our gunshot theory.

00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:06,809
We're traveling
at 30,000 feet.

00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,044
I'm Harrigan.

00:12:08,044 --> 00:12:09,812
I am going to take
over the plane

00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,481
and I'm going to fly it
into the Mediterranean.

00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:12,882
Payback for
bankrupting you

00:12:12,882 --> 00:12:14,083
in one night
at the tables.

00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:15,518
I pull my nine-mil

00:12:15,518 --> 00:12:16,953
and I start for
the cockpit.

00:12:16,953 --> 00:12:18,454
But one of the other
passengers sees you.

00:12:18,454 --> 00:12:20,323
Jane or John Doe.
Tries to overpower you.

00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:22,892
And we struggle
for the gun.

00:12:22,892 --> 00:12:24,527
(mutters):
We're struggling.

00:12:24,527 --> 00:12:26,863
In that struggle,
the gun goes off,

00:12:26,863 --> 00:12:29,332
hitting the cabin door.

00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:33,202
Would explain the initial
slow loss of cabin pressure.

00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:36,172
And then Harrigan breaks free...

00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,373
(clears throat)

00:12:37,373 --> 00:12:39,542
commandeers the plane.

00:12:39,542 --> 00:12:41,444
Pilot only has time
to radio once

00:12:41,444 --> 00:12:43,312
and turns the plane around.

00:12:43,312 --> 00:12:45,014
It was what Harrigan
wanted anyway:

00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,216
to return to Vegas
on a suicide mission.

00:12:47,216 --> 00:12:48,551
Yeah, and what he
doesn't realize

00:12:48,551 --> 00:12:51,154
is that the cabin door
is already compromised.

00:12:51,154 --> 00:12:52,955
Bullet must've hit
the door somewhere.

00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,525
I'm not seeing anything.

00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:57,860
No holes, no marks.

00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,995
Must be missing something.

00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:02,065
Just saying.

00:13:02,065 --> 00:13:03,900
Maybe the bullet hit
a cabin door seal

00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,334
and compromised it.

00:13:10,807 --> 00:13:12,008
I got something.

00:13:12,008 --> 00:13:13,209
Bullet hole?

00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,477
No, but I think our inside job

00:13:14,477 --> 00:13:15,878
just turned into
an outside job.

00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,845
Tool marks
on the outside edge.

00:13:20,845 --> 00:13:22,046
This door was
tampered with

00:13:22,046 --> 00:13:23,414
before the plane
even took off.

00:13:23,414 --> 00:13:24,849
Sabotage.

00:13:24,849 --> 00:13:26,550
We've been looking
at this the wrong way.

00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:27,985
Maybe the motive
wasn't hijacking.

00:13:27,985 --> 00:13:29,720
Maybe it was
straight-up murder.

00:13:34,358 --> 00:13:36,494
So the plane was doomed
before it even took off.

00:13:36,494 --> 00:13:37,862
WILSON: Yeah, somebody
on the ground

00:13:37,862 --> 00:13:39,096
made sure of that.

00:13:39,096 --> 00:13:40,698
Tampered with
the cabin door seal.

00:13:40,698 --> 00:13:42,733
The seal couldn't handle
the increasing pressure,

00:13:42,733 --> 00:13:44,135
and finally the
door blew out.

00:13:44,135 --> 00:13:47,004
We're talking murder now,
not hijacking.

00:13:47,004 --> 00:13:48,906
Somebody on that plane
was targeted.

00:13:48,906 --> 00:13:50,808
WILSON:
We've got our pilot,
Keith Mannheim,

00:13:50,808 --> 00:13:52,643
and our other three
remaining passengers,

00:13:52,643 --> 00:13:54,478
but so far we've only
identified one:

00:13:54,478 --> 00:13:57,615
Charles Harrigan, the man
we thought was our hijacker.

00:13:57,615 --> 00:13:59,884
You know, if he got into a
squabble with the Mediterranean,

00:13:59,884 --> 00:14:01,652
maybe he got into a fight
with someone else,

00:14:01,652 --> 00:14:03,087
somebody he shouldn't have.

00:14:03,087 --> 00:14:04,855
Yeah, it could have put
a target on his back,

00:14:04,855 --> 00:14:06,057
or maybe the target's

00:14:06,057 --> 00:14:07,525
just one of the
other passengers,

00:14:07,525 --> 00:14:08,926
our John or Jane Doe.

00:14:08,926 --> 00:14:11,429
There is one
other possibility.
What's that?

00:14:11,429 --> 00:14:14,932
Maybe the plane was the target.

00:14:14,932 --> 00:14:17,468
HODGES:
Didn't see this
on the outside of the door.

00:14:17,468 --> 00:14:20,705
Must have gotten wedged
in the seal.

00:14:20,705 --> 00:14:22,406
Got paint trace

00:14:22,406 --> 00:14:26,377
from what I hope is our
<i>outil de sabotage.</i>

00:14:26,377 --> 00:14:27,511
It's all yours.

00:14:30,815 --> 00:14:33,851
So this, uh,
NTSB guy, Wilson.

00:14:33,851 --> 00:14:35,086
Seems like
a good sort.

00:14:35,086 --> 00:14:36,620
He is.

00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:40,024
When you guys worked
together in Frisco,

00:14:40,024 --> 00:14:41,859
were you, uh...close?

00:14:41,859 --> 00:14:43,794
Well, it was a pretty
lengthy investigation.

00:14:43,794 --> 00:14:45,863
We spent a lot
of time together.

00:14:45,863 --> 00:14:48,032
Yeah, there's spending time
together, and there's...

00:14:48,032 --> 00:14:49,967
spending time together.

00:14:49,967 --> 00:14:51,769
What are you getting at,
Hodges?

00:14:51,769 --> 00:14:54,038
I--I'm not getting
at anything.

00:14:54,038 --> 00:14:55,606
How's it going in here?

00:14:55,606 --> 00:14:57,575
Well, the
Mikrosil's ready.

00:14:57,575 --> 00:14:58,876
Good.

00:14:58,876 --> 00:15:00,578
Good cast.

00:15:00,578 --> 00:15:01,779
No bubbles.

00:15:01,779 --> 00:15:03,114
You can see
the tool marks.

00:15:03,114 --> 00:15:04,749
Helps if you get in close,
doesn't it?

00:15:07,118 --> 00:15:08,619
Is that...is that
paint transfer?

00:15:08,619 --> 00:15:10,388
Indeed.

00:15:10,388 --> 00:15:13,090
Don't you have, like,
a machine to go put that in?

00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:14,692
Say no more.

00:15:14,692 --> 00:15:15,860
Three's a crowd.

00:15:17,595 --> 00:15:19,029
Come and knock on my door.

00:15:19,029 --> 00:15:20,464
(crashes)

00:15:20,464 --> 00:15:22,566
What's his problem?

00:15:22,566 --> 00:15:24,802
Don't even get me started.

00:15:24,802 --> 00:15:26,504
These marks are paired.

00:15:26,504 --> 00:15:28,706
I'm thinking that the tool
might have been two-pronged.

00:15:28,706 --> 00:15:30,775
You can tell what kind
of tool it was?
No,

00:15:30,775 --> 00:15:32,843
but between the Mikrosil cast
and the paint chips,

00:15:32,843 --> 00:15:34,712
if we find it,
we should get a match.

00:15:34,712 --> 00:15:36,580
You know, whoever tampered
with this cabin door

00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,882
knew exactly what
they were doing.

00:15:37,882 --> 00:15:39,650
Too much damage

00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:41,652
and the plane wouldn't
have pressurized at all...

00:15:41,652 --> 00:15:43,387
Setting off a warning
light in the cabin.

00:15:43,387 --> 00:15:45,589
The pilot would've turned
the plane around immediately.

00:15:45,589 --> 00:15:47,491
Too little damage would've
had no effect at all.

00:15:47,491 --> 00:15:49,026
Saboteur had to
get it just right.

00:15:49,026 --> 00:15:51,061
Suggests an intimate
knowledge of the plane.

00:15:55,065 --> 00:15:56,734
STOKES:
Hello!

00:15:56,734 --> 00:15:58,369
Are you Hal?

00:15:58,369 --> 00:15:59,737
Yeah, I'm Hal.

00:15:59,737 --> 00:16:01,705
Yeah, the same Hal that,
uh, did the maintenance

00:16:01,705 --> 00:16:03,541
on that charter jet
that went down last night?

00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:05,843
I--I already gave
the logs to NTSB.

00:16:05,843 --> 00:16:07,578
Look, I'm good
at what I do.

00:16:07,578 --> 00:16:09,780
I checked and double-checked
every system on that plane.

00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:12,049
Well, we're not saying that an
oversight caused it to crash.

00:16:12,049 --> 00:16:13,818
No, we're saying
somebody brought it down.

00:16:13,818 --> 00:16:15,052
FINLAY:
Can you tell us

00:16:15,052 --> 00:16:17,788
about your relationship
with LVN Charter.

00:16:17,788 --> 00:16:19,523
Yeah, my relationship is fine.

00:16:19,523 --> 00:16:20,758
Been taking care
of their plane

00:16:20,758 --> 00:16:21,959
ever since I left Beaufort.

00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:23,360
FINLAY:
When was the last time

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,595
they paid you?

00:16:25,696 --> 00:16:27,498
Yeah, it's been a while.

00:16:27,498 --> 00:16:29,700
Been a while? It's been,
like, four months, hasn't it?

00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,569
They owe you over six grand.

00:16:31,569 --> 00:16:33,504
Hey, look, I'm not going
to sabotage a plane

00:16:33,504 --> 00:16:35,039
over a lousy six grand.

00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,908
These are your tools, right?

00:16:37,908 --> 00:16:40,544
Yeah, they're my tools.

00:16:40,544 --> 00:16:41,779
Well, you certainly have

00:16:41,779 --> 00:16:43,080
an interesting way
of marking them.

00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,882
Helps me keep track of them.

00:16:44,882 --> 00:16:47,084
Green color is the same that
we found on the cabin door.

00:16:47,084 --> 00:16:48,752
What? You're saying
somebody

00:16:48,752 --> 00:16:50,688
messed with the plane
using my tools?

00:16:50,688 --> 00:16:52,823
No, we're wondering
if maybe you messed with it.

00:16:52,823 --> 00:16:55,059
I didn't mess with it,
all right?

00:16:55,059 --> 00:16:56,827
I been in Laughlin
the last couple of days.

00:16:56,827 --> 00:16:58,562
I got back this morning.

00:16:58,562 --> 00:17:00,130
Yeah, well, I'm packing
up your tools.

00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:01,665
They're coming with me now.

00:17:01,665 --> 00:17:03,634
These tools are my livelihood.

00:17:03,634 --> 00:17:05,002
Hey, you maintain a jet

00:17:05,002 --> 00:17:06,904
that took a nose dive
into the ground last night,

00:17:06,904 --> 00:17:08,873
I don't think your phone's
ringing off the hook.

00:17:08,873 --> 00:17:10,007
Is it?

00:17:34,398 --> 00:17:36,100
Sorry.
Quick question.

00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,535
I'm having a little trouble

00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:39,803
searching your
father's surname.

00:17:39,803 --> 00:17:42,540
Did you ever see it
spelled E-K-L-I?

00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,074
Actually, yes.

00:17:44,074 --> 00:17:46,710
I think my grandfather--
I've seen him spell it that way.

00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:48,479
Brilliant. I knew it.

00:17:48,479 --> 00:17:49,880
Uh, I have
a question for you.

00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,582
In your genealogy work,

00:17:51,582 --> 00:17:53,684
have you heard of ITS Labs?

00:17:53,684 --> 00:17:54,919
Indeed I have.

00:17:54,919 --> 00:17:57,555
ITS is a DNA lab in Dallas.

00:17:57,555 --> 00:17:59,590
Their business
specializes

00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,692
in do-it-yourself
DNA analysis

00:18:01,692 --> 00:18:03,093
in paternity suits.

00:18:03,093 --> 00:18:04,895
Paternity suits?
Mm-hmm.

00:18:04,895 --> 00:18:08,365
The lab mails you a DNA kit,
you do your own swabbing.

00:18:08,365 --> 00:18:10,000
Wrap it up
and mail it back.

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,569
Answer comes
in a couple of weeks.

00:18:11,569 --> 00:18:13,571
There's no name
on the return label.

00:18:13,571 --> 00:18:15,639
Well, for confidentiality,
they use serial numbers

00:18:15,639 --> 00:18:16,840
to identify the client.

00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,576
Look at the shipping label.

00:18:18,576 --> 00:18:20,110
Great. With a warrant,

00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:22,680
I might have Jane Doe's I.D.

00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,115
You may also have motive.

00:18:25,115 --> 00:18:27,551
I'm sorry. I couldn't
help but overhear

00:18:27,551 --> 00:18:29,653
about the plane
being sabotaged.

00:18:29,653 --> 00:18:32,389
You know
that paternity suits

00:18:32,389 --> 00:18:35,693
are particularly contentious.

00:18:35,693 --> 00:18:38,095
Contentious enough
to make Jane Doe our target?

00:18:38,095 --> 00:18:42,066
I remember hearing about
a fast-food franchise mogul

00:18:42,066 --> 00:18:44,101
who fathered a child
with his secretary,

00:18:44,101 --> 00:18:45,736
and when she tried
to prove paternity

00:18:45,736 --> 00:18:47,104
and get child support,

00:18:47,104 --> 00:18:49,974
he, uh, dunked her
in the fryer.

00:18:49,974 --> 00:18:51,909
I'm just throwing it
out there.

00:18:54,011 --> 00:18:56,113
I'm just going to give
this to Henry.

00:19:02,052 --> 00:19:05,122
(cell phone buzzes)

00:19:08,525 --> 00:19:10,728
You can take that.
I'll come back.

00:19:10,728 --> 00:19:11,996
No, that's all right.

00:19:11,996 --> 00:19:13,864
I--I'll call him
back later.

00:19:18,435 --> 00:19:19,803
If you ever feel like talking...

00:19:22,072 --> 00:19:23,774
You ever tried
the long-distance thing?

00:19:23,774 --> 00:19:25,909
No, but I think it
would have helped

00:19:25,909 --> 00:19:28,078
my relationship
with husband number two.

00:19:28,078 --> 00:19:29,947
Ah, the Seattle ex?

00:19:29,947 --> 00:19:31,782
Yeah.

00:19:31,782 --> 00:19:34,385
What was that like,
seeing him again?

00:19:34,385 --> 00:19:36,854
It was weird.

00:19:36,854 --> 00:19:38,622
And then it wasn't.

00:19:38,622 --> 00:19:40,924
You know, I wondered why
you took a later flight.

00:19:40,924 --> 00:19:43,761
What about your NTSB guy?

00:19:43,761 --> 00:19:44,995
Is that weird?

00:19:44,995 --> 00:19:46,597
Very weird.

00:19:46,597 --> 00:19:48,098
(both chuckling)

00:19:48,098 --> 00:19:50,467
Gonna stay that way?

00:19:50,467 --> 00:19:52,603
It has to, right?

00:19:56,507 --> 00:19:58,542
This looks promising.
Similar tool marks

00:19:58,542 --> 00:20:00,477
as the sabotage
that we found

00:20:00,477 --> 00:20:02,146
on the cabin door.

00:20:02,146 --> 00:20:04,682
Can you pass me those, uh,
paint chips that Hodges found?

00:20:04,682 --> 00:20:06,050
Sure.

00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:07,751
Thanks.

00:20:15,926 --> 00:20:17,828
Got a physical match.

00:20:17,828 --> 00:20:19,363
Got a murder weapon.

00:20:19,363 --> 00:20:21,398
But not a murder suspect.

00:20:21,398 --> 00:20:23,033
Hal the mechanic's alibi
checked out.

00:20:23,033 --> 00:20:24,668
Eye in the sky

00:20:24,668 --> 00:20:26,637
at the Lucky Stakes Casino
in Laughlin

00:20:26,637 --> 00:20:28,539
had him at the tables
three nights in a row.

00:20:28,539 --> 00:20:30,674
So Hal's off the hook.

00:20:30,674 --> 00:20:32,776
But somebody helped
themselves to his tools.

00:20:32,776 --> 00:20:34,845
Yeah, someone who had access
to the airport.

00:20:34,845 --> 00:20:36,647
Surveillance hasn't
come in yet,

00:20:36,647 --> 00:20:39,349
but maybe we'll get lucky
and find our killer on it.

00:20:39,349 --> 00:20:41,485
Well, in the meantime,
we have a lead

00:20:41,485 --> 00:20:42,820
on our other
John Doe.

00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,621
The gun's not
registered to Harrigan

00:20:44,621 --> 00:20:46,090
like we thought.

00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:48,358
It's actually registered
to a Jeffrey Forsythe.

00:20:48,358 --> 00:20:50,461
He's a partner
in a law firm downtown.

00:20:50,461 --> 00:20:51,795
Brass called the office.

00:20:51,795 --> 00:20:53,764
Apparently, Forsythe
wasn't on the plane.

00:20:53,764 --> 00:20:55,632
Maybe he knows who was.

00:20:55,632 --> 00:20:59,136
Mr. Forsythe, we matched
the serial numbers on this gun

00:20:59,136 --> 00:21:00,637
found at the crash site
to you.

00:21:00,637 --> 00:21:01,839
It's your gun.

00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:03,707
I leant it to my colleague,

00:21:03,707 --> 00:21:05,843
my friend Grant Abbott.

00:21:05,843 --> 00:21:07,511
He was on that plane.

00:21:07,511 --> 00:21:11,782
Our firm uses
LVN Charters exclusively.

00:21:11,782 --> 00:21:14,651
Grant told me he was flying
to Chicago last week.

00:21:14,651 --> 00:21:17,654
He used to live there,
still has a place.

00:21:17,654 --> 00:21:19,790
He'd decided to take
a little time off.

00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:21,125
Why?

00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:24,394
Same reason he was
carrying my gun.

00:21:24,394 --> 00:21:27,464
Grant is the go-to
criminal attorney at our firm.

00:21:27,464 --> 00:21:29,032
He represents
numerous clients

00:21:29,032 --> 00:21:32,770
with, uh, proclivities
to violence.

00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:34,538
Did Mr. Abbott have any concerns

00:21:34,538 --> 00:21:36,540
about any of these clients
in particular?

00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,741
I can tell you
that Grant

00:21:37,741 --> 00:21:39,710
had a misunderstanding
with one client,

00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:42,346
who subsequently
fired our firm

00:21:42,346 --> 00:21:44,114
and made veiled threats.

00:21:44,114 --> 00:21:46,683
I'm going to need that name.

00:21:46,683 --> 00:21:48,552
RUSSELL:
<i>Donna, I've heard</i>
<i>so much about you.</i>

00:21:48,552 --> 00:21:50,420
It's a pleasure to meet you.

00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,688
The pleasure is mine.

00:21:51,688 --> 00:21:53,690
Donna was helping me
with my family tree,

00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:55,659
but now she is helping
us with a case.

00:21:55,659 --> 00:21:58,095
We found a DNA kit
in our Jane Doe's luggage.

00:21:58,095 --> 00:22:00,531
Thanks to Donna, we were
able to trace it back

00:22:00,531 --> 00:22:01,765
to a private lab.

00:22:01,765 --> 00:22:03,467
They gave us a name.

00:22:03,467 --> 00:22:05,903
Jordan Lowell,
Chicago address.

00:22:05,903 --> 00:22:08,806
Requested a kit
two weeks ago from ITS Labs.

00:22:08,806 --> 00:22:10,140
What's that about?

00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:11,975
Well, we think she may
have been looking

00:22:11,975 --> 00:22:14,878
for proof of paternity in
a potential child support case.

00:22:14,878 --> 00:22:16,613
Jordan Lowell may
have had a baby

00:22:16,613 --> 00:22:18,382
with the wrong kind of guy.

00:22:18,382 --> 00:22:20,984
Okay, do we know if
she used the, uh, DNA kit?

00:22:20,984 --> 00:22:22,452
BRODY:
It looks that way.

00:22:22,452 --> 00:22:23,921
Henry's running the swabs now.

00:22:23,921 --> 00:22:25,522
If the victim was
able to obtain

00:22:25,522 --> 00:22:27,524
an exemplar from the father,

00:22:27,524 --> 00:22:29,626
you could have
the DNA of the killer.

00:22:29,626 --> 00:22:31,762
We could. You're right.

00:22:31,762 --> 00:22:33,964
Then again, I just
got a call from Brass.

00:22:33,964 --> 00:22:35,799
Turns out that the passenger
with the gun

00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:39,136
was a criminal attorney who may
have disappointed a client.

00:22:39,136 --> 00:22:40,537
Hey.
Yeah?

00:22:40,537 --> 00:22:42,105
You're not going
to believe this.

00:22:42,105 --> 00:22:45,742
A lady in Henderson returned
home from a business trip,

00:22:45,742 --> 00:22:47,477
found some dude
floating in her pool.

00:22:47,477 --> 00:22:48,679
So?

00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:50,547
He came from the plane.

00:22:52,349 --> 00:22:54,084
There was another
passenger on board?
No.

00:22:54,084 --> 00:22:56,386
According to the
driver's license,

00:22:56,386 --> 00:22:58,055
he was the pilot,

00:22:58,055 --> 00:23:00,557
Keith Mannheim.

00:23:00,557 --> 00:23:02,426
So if he's our pilot,

00:23:02,426 --> 00:23:04,595
who's the dead guy
in the cockpit?

00:23:10,868 --> 00:23:13,437
Doc, I thought we
already found our pilot.

00:23:13,437 --> 00:23:15,472
Please, make sense
of this for me.

00:23:15,472 --> 00:23:17,074
I'll try.

00:23:17,074 --> 00:23:19,576
Prints and DNA
both confirm this body--

00:23:19,576 --> 00:23:21,144
the one pulled out
of a pool in Henderson--

00:23:21,144 --> 00:23:23,347
is our pilot.
Keith Mannheim.

00:23:23,347 --> 00:23:26,650
Victim has a distinctive,
crescent-shaped head wound.

00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:28,819
Looks like some sort
of blunt-force trauma

00:23:28,819 --> 00:23:31,388
unrelated to the rest
of his injuries.

00:23:31,388 --> 00:23:34,057
The skin tearing and fractures
are both consistent

00:23:34,057 --> 00:23:35,492
with a high-altitude fall.

00:23:35,492 --> 00:23:36,793
RUSSELL:
All right, what about

00:23:36,793 --> 00:23:39,129
the other remains that
we found in the cockpit?

00:23:39,129 --> 00:23:40,831
Well, now that we know
it's someone else,

00:23:40,831 --> 00:23:42,499
Henry's running the DNA.

00:23:42,499 --> 00:23:44,801
So we have a mystery man
that we found in the cockpit

00:23:44,801 --> 00:23:46,536
who's not the pilot.

00:23:46,536 --> 00:23:49,373
How the hell does that work?

00:23:49,373 --> 00:23:51,575
SIDLE:
<i>So, we got five people</i>
<i>on the plane.</i>

00:23:51,575 --> 00:23:53,443
If our pilot,
Keith Mannheim,

00:23:53,443 --> 00:23:54,778
is at the controls,

00:23:54,778 --> 00:23:57,714
then our mystery man
from the cockpit wreckage

00:23:57,714 --> 00:24:00,651
must have been sitting
in the copilot's seat.

00:24:00,651 --> 00:24:03,420
Two in front,
three passengers in back.

00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:07,457
17-minute mark, we have
the slow loss of cabin pressure.

00:24:07,457 --> 00:24:10,928
Mannheim radios
he's turning around.

00:24:10,928 --> 00:24:12,763
Maybe the pilot wants
to check something out.

00:24:12,763 --> 00:24:14,431
Maybe that's why he
gets out of his seat.

00:24:14,431 --> 00:24:15,899
Yeah, but not before
Mannheim enters in

00:24:15,899 --> 00:24:17,968
the vector coordinates
for a return.

00:24:17,968 --> 00:24:20,971
Making a slow descent.

00:24:24,541 --> 00:24:26,510
A few seconds later,
door blows.

00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,716
And Mannheim gets
sucked out the plane door.

00:24:32,716 --> 00:24:34,117
Doc Robbins said
that he had

00:24:34,117 --> 00:24:36,019
a crescent-shaped
head wound.

00:24:38,055 --> 00:24:40,657
Looks like he hit his head
on the way out, huh?

00:24:40,657 --> 00:24:42,092
Uh-huh.
One mystery solved.

00:24:42,092 --> 00:24:43,660
One step at a time.

00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:44,962
SANDERS:
Hey, guys.

00:24:44,962 --> 00:24:46,763
Uh, Henry ran the DNA
from our mystery man

00:24:46,763 --> 00:24:48,098
through CODIS,
and he got a hit.

00:24:48,098 --> 00:24:50,500
A parolee named
Thurston Mayfield,

00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,702
aka Thor.

00:24:51,702 --> 00:24:52,936
Thor?

00:24:52,936 --> 00:24:55,372
Specialized in writing
phony checks,

00:24:55,372 --> 00:24:57,708
and recently was a dancer
in an all-male revue.

00:24:57,708 --> 00:25:00,777
Now, the club is just two blocks
from the executive airport.

00:25:00,777 --> 00:25:02,012
Brass talked to the owner.

00:25:02,012 --> 00:25:04,548
It turns out that
Thor quit last week.

00:25:04,548 --> 00:25:06,717
He said he was moving in
with his new boyfriend,

00:25:06,717 --> 00:25:08,018
Keith Mannheim.

00:25:08,018 --> 00:25:09,553
WILSON:
That would explain why Thor

00:25:09,553 --> 00:25:11,121
was sitting up front
in the cockpit.

00:25:11,121 --> 00:25:13,123
Keith was flying his new
boyfriend home to Chicago

00:25:13,123 --> 00:25:14,758
to meet the folks.

00:25:14,758 --> 00:25:18,028
And if Keith's partner
Dalton found out about it,

00:25:18,028 --> 00:25:20,530
might be reason enough
to want them both dead.

00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:23,567
STOKES:
You know that guy?

00:25:23,567 --> 00:25:24,968
No.

00:25:24,968 --> 00:25:26,737
Classic case of
"I didn't recognize him

00:25:26,737 --> 00:25:28,071
with his clothes on."

00:25:28,071 --> 00:25:30,941
How about now?

00:25:30,941 --> 00:25:32,442
The place where he dances

00:25:32,442 --> 00:25:34,811
is right out by your airport.

00:25:34,811 --> 00:25:36,580
Yeah, I guess.

00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:38,482
I--I've been there
a few times times with Keith.

00:25:38,482 --> 00:25:40,650
Yeah, old Keith, he went there
a lot on his own, didn't he?

00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:42,486
What does that mean?
FINLAY:
It means that we

00:25:42,486 --> 00:25:43,854
talked to some
people at the club,

00:25:43,854 --> 00:25:45,489
and it, uh, turns out

00:25:45,489 --> 00:25:49,459
that Thor and Keith
were having a thing.

00:25:49,459 --> 00:25:51,028
It was kind of
hot and heavy.

00:25:53,597 --> 00:25:55,399
Well, if that's true,
I didn't know about it.

00:25:55,399 --> 00:25:56,700
STOKES:
Suppose you didn't know

00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:59,036
that Thor was on that
plane, neither, huh?

00:25:59,036 --> 00:26:00,504
With Keith?

00:26:00,504 --> 00:26:02,739
Cockpit, right by
Keith's side.

00:26:02,739 --> 00:26:04,841
He was flying home
to meet Keith's parents.

00:26:04,841 --> 00:26:06,109
FINLAY:
Yeah, it must suck

00:26:06,109 --> 00:26:07,577
having your partner
cheat on you

00:26:07,577 --> 00:26:08,812
with someone like this.

00:26:08,812 --> 00:26:10,947
That would really
piss me off.

00:26:10,947 --> 00:26:12,449
You know, maybe just enough

00:26:12,449 --> 00:26:14,084
to actually do
something about it.

00:26:14,084 --> 00:26:17,621
(scoffs)

00:26:17,621 --> 00:26:19,489
You think I brought down
my own plane

00:26:19,489 --> 00:26:22,426
with the most important person
in the world to me on board?

00:26:22,426 --> 00:26:25,462
Well, the way I see it,
the plane's insured, right?

00:26:25,462 --> 00:26:26,730
I mean, with Keith
out of the way,

00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:28,465
you can start
the business over,

00:26:28,465 --> 00:26:30,467
and this time without
having to share the profits

00:26:30,467 --> 00:26:31,668
with some cheating
boyfriend.

00:26:31,668 --> 00:26:33,503
Fuel log says
that you refueled

00:26:33,503 --> 00:26:35,005
and performed
the last safety check

00:26:35,005 --> 00:26:37,774
on that plane 12 hours
before it crashed.

00:26:37,774 --> 00:26:39,810
I didn't sabotage
my own plane!

00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:41,878
In the heat of anger.
I get it.

00:26:41,878 --> 00:26:44,414
No. No, you people
don't get it.

00:26:44,414 --> 00:26:45,949
I lost everything
in that crash.

00:26:48,118 --> 00:26:49,753
Everything.

00:26:55,926 --> 00:26:58,695
Looks like you got
the airport surveillance.
Yeah.

00:26:58,695 --> 00:27:00,897
Sugar, no cream?

00:27:00,897 --> 00:27:02,999
Thanks.
Mm-hmm.

00:27:02,999 --> 00:27:04,634
WILSON:
Anything?

00:27:04,634 --> 00:27:06,937
Nothing yet, but I did confirm
Burk refilling the plane

00:27:06,937 --> 00:27:09,606
and doing a safety check
12 hours before takeoff.

00:27:09,606 --> 00:27:11,007
He never touched
the plane door,

00:27:11,007 --> 00:27:12,909
and so far, nobody else
has touched the plane.

00:27:14,411 --> 00:27:16,079
WILSON: Listen, Sara,
I was just wondering

00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:19,850
if I could buy you
and Grissom dinner tonight.

00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:22,452
You guys pick the place,
NTSB picks up the tab.

00:27:22,452 --> 00:27:24,621
I'm a hell
of a third wheel.

00:27:24,621 --> 00:27:27,491
Actually, Gil's out of town.

00:27:27,491 --> 00:27:28,859
Okay, just the two
of us, then?

00:27:28,859 --> 00:27:30,093
Don't.
Don't what?

00:27:30,093 --> 00:27:32,395
Do this.

00:27:32,395 --> 00:27:33,597
Okay.

00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:37,667
I mean, if everything's
good between you two--

00:27:37,667 --> 00:27:39,536
and I know you, Sara,
so I'm getting the feeling

00:27:39,536 --> 00:27:41,705
that maybe it isn't--
then, I understand.

00:27:41,705 --> 00:27:43,907
Everything's great.

00:27:43,907 --> 00:27:45,642
Okay.

00:27:49,346 --> 00:27:51,414
Fuel truck--stopping
in front of the plane.

00:27:51,414 --> 00:27:52,749
Right in front of
the cabin door.

00:27:52,749 --> 00:27:54,584
What's he doing?
They already refueled.

00:27:54,584 --> 00:27:56,386
One guy's getting
out of the truck.

00:27:56,386 --> 00:27:58,989
(taps key, video blipping)

00:27:58,989 --> 00:28:00,757
He was only there
for two minutes.

00:28:00,757 --> 00:28:02,459
Is that enough time
to sabotage a plane?

00:28:02,459 --> 00:28:03,760
Yes, it is.

00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,829
Can you get a better
look at the driver?

00:28:05,829 --> 00:28:07,831
I can't bring up
a face.

00:28:07,831 --> 00:28:10,066
But look at this.

00:28:10,066 --> 00:28:11,635
WILSON:
Beaufort Aero Club patch.

00:28:11,635 --> 00:28:12,836
Those are Hal's overalls.

00:28:12,836 --> 00:28:14,404
And we know that
Hal was out of town.

00:28:14,404 --> 00:28:15,939
We know that somebody
borrowed his tools.

00:28:15,939 --> 00:28:17,140
Borrowed his clothes,
as well.

00:28:35,091 --> 00:28:37,694
(whirring)

00:28:37,694 --> 00:28:39,462
ANDREWS:
<i>I got your results.</i>

00:28:39,462 --> 00:28:43,066
DNA on the coveralls did not
match Dalton Burk, so...

00:28:43,066 --> 00:28:44,834
goodbye prime suspect.

00:28:44,834 --> 00:28:46,069
Sorry. It's a dead end.

00:28:46,069 --> 00:28:48,872
Were you able to run
the ITS DNA kit

00:28:48,872 --> 00:28:51,107
that Morgan found
in Jordan Lowell's luggage?

00:28:51,107 --> 00:28:53,143
Yeah. Jordan used
two of the swabs,

00:28:53,143 --> 00:28:54,844
but both were degraded,

00:28:54,844 --> 00:28:56,379
probably from the crash
and the fire,

00:28:56,379 --> 00:28:57,948
so I couldn't get DNA.

00:28:57,948 --> 00:28:59,716
The weird thing is,
Morgan said she thought

00:28:59,716 --> 00:29:01,718
this all had to do with
a paternity suit.

00:29:01,718 --> 00:29:03,720
Right.
But to do a paternity test,

00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,789
you need to use three swabs.

00:29:05,789 --> 00:29:07,557
Yeah, you're
absolutely right.

00:29:07,557 --> 00:29:09,826
One for each of the parents,
and one for the child.

00:29:09,826 --> 00:29:12,362
So what was Jordan Lowell
testing for, then?

00:29:12,362 --> 00:29:15,699
Most people use ITS
to verify the baby's father,

00:29:15,699 --> 00:29:18,935
but a lot of people use it
to find their own father.

00:29:18,935 --> 00:29:21,037
Do you think that's
what Jordan Lowell was doing?

00:29:21,037 --> 00:29:22,806
I know that's what
she was doing.

00:29:22,806 --> 00:29:24,908
Just got off the phone
with her roommate in Chicago.

00:29:24,908 --> 00:29:27,811
Turns out Jordan was raised
by a single mother.

00:29:27,811 --> 00:29:29,613
After her mother died,
she started looking

00:29:29,613 --> 00:29:31,848
for her father that
she'd never met.

00:29:31,848 --> 00:29:33,850
Her roommate said
she got a lead in Vegas.

00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:36,019
Donna, you think this
is something you can
help us with?

00:29:36,019 --> 00:29:37,754
Give me a birthplace
and a birth date.

00:29:37,754 --> 00:29:39,389
Right there.

00:29:39,389 --> 00:29:41,124
DONNA: Well, we'll start
looking for the father

00:29:41,124 --> 00:29:43,627
by searching for
Jordan's birth certificate.

00:29:43,627 --> 00:29:45,128
RUSSELL:
No name for the father.

00:29:45,128 --> 00:29:46,596
But that makes sense.

00:29:46,596 --> 00:29:48,064
That's who she was
looking for, right?

00:29:48,064 --> 00:29:49,566
DONNA:
Look at the mother's age.

00:29:49,566 --> 00:29:51,801
Fifteen.
DONNA:
Back in 1968.

00:29:51,801 --> 00:29:54,070
There were a lot of strict rules
about what unwed mothers

00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,939
could put on
the birth certificate.

00:29:55,939 --> 00:29:58,141
They could only give the baby
their own surname.

00:29:58,141 --> 00:30:00,677
But the rules only applied
to the baby's last name,

00:30:00,677 --> 00:30:03,647
so sometimes the girls took
the father's surname

00:30:03,647 --> 00:30:05,482
and made it the baby's
first name.

00:30:05,482 --> 00:30:07,484
You mean like "Jordan."
Mm-hmm.

00:30:07,484 --> 00:30:08,852
Sounds like
we should be looking for

00:30:08,852 --> 00:30:11,554
a Mr. Jordan in Las Vegas.

00:30:11,554 --> 00:30:13,657
Morgan, did Jordan's
roommate ever mention

00:30:13,657 --> 00:30:15,625
if she used
a genealogy Web site?

00:30:15,625 --> 00:30:18,395
Yeah, actually, uh, she said
she used ancestry.com.

00:30:18,395 --> 00:30:19,929
Great!

00:30:19,929 --> 00:30:23,366
Ancestry not only helps people
find their relatives,

00:30:23,366 --> 00:30:25,402
but if it finds two people
who are searching

00:30:25,402 --> 00:30:27,070
for the same relative,
it connects them.

00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:29,839
So if we input the same
information that Jordan did,

00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:31,841
the we'll be able to find
what she found.

00:30:31,841 --> 00:30:33,877
DONNA: Let me just link
into Jordan's family tree.

00:30:36,379 --> 00:30:39,816
And there he is--
Jordan's father.

00:30:39,816 --> 00:30:42,052
"Joseph Donovan Jordan."

00:30:42,052 --> 00:30:44,120
Looks like she found him,
but a little too late.

00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,756
Died December 12, 2005.

00:30:46,756 --> 00:30:49,092
Yeah, but look
below his name.

00:30:49,092 --> 00:30:52,128
He had a daughter--
Helen, born in 1962.

00:30:52,128 --> 00:30:53,763
RUSSELL:
Half-sister.

00:30:53,763 --> 00:30:57,467
So maybe Helen is the lead
that Jordan found in Vegas.

00:30:57,467 --> 00:30:59,936
Mm-hmm. And that's why
Jordan used the DNA kit.

00:30:59,936 --> 00:31:01,938
She swabbed herself, so she
could compare her DNA

00:31:01,938 --> 00:31:03,506
with that of her sister's.

00:31:03,506 --> 00:31:05,842
I'm looking up
Helen Jordan right now.

00:31:05,842 --> 00:31:07,143
And I'm getting nothing.

00:31:07,143 --> 00:31:08,545
Not a driver's license?

00:31:08,545 --> 00:31:09,846
Not even a Social
Security number.

00:31:09,846 --> 00:31:11,014
How is that possible?

00:31:11,014 --> 00:31:12,949
Okay, well, hold on.

00:31:12,949 --> 00:31:15,852
There's a link under
Helen's name.

00:31:15,852 --> 00:31:18,555
Looks like we just
found Helen Jordan.

00:31:18,555 --> 00:31:20,724
MAN: Are you feeling
all right today?

00:31:20,724 --> 00:31:23,526
BRODY:
We didn't realize Helen Jordan
wasn't living on her own.

00:31:23,526 --> 00:31:25,795
Yeah, how long has she been
under your care, Dr. O'Keefe?

00:31:25,795 --> 00:31:29,065
Helen's been at our facility
for almost 40 years now.

00:31:29,065 --> 00:31:30,567
Since she was 12.

00:31:31,968 --> 00:31:33,370
Helen?

00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:36,406
These nice people
have come to visit.

00:31:36,406 --> 00:31:37,841
BRODY:
Uh...

00:31:37,841 --> 00:31:39,709
I don't understand.

00:31:39,709 --> 00:31:42,612
Helen was in a car accident
when she was ten.

00:31:42,612 --> 00:31:45,515
Her mother was killed
and she was left, well,

00:31:45,515 --> 00:31:47,717
as you see her.

00:31:47,717 --> 00:31:50,520
Her father tried several
special hospitals

00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,755
before bringing
her here.

00:31:54,758 --> 00:31:56,726
Helen?

00:31:56,726 --> 00:31:59,829
Did a woman named Jordan Lowell
visit Helen recently?

00:31:59,829 --> 00:32:01,831
Yes. Several times over
the past few months.

00:32:01,831 --> 00:32:04,601
She was wonderful.
Read to her for hours.

00:32:04,601 --> 00:32:07,370
She told me she thought
Helen was her half-sister.

00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:09,372
Even took a DNA sample.

00:32:09,372 --> 00:32:10,874
(sighs heavily)

00:32:10,874 --> 00:32:12,709
We're gonna have
to do the same.

00:32:12,709 --> 00:32:15,678
Is there some reason the police
are interested in Helen?

00:32:15,678 --> 00:32:17,347
Actually, we're interested
in the woman

00:32:17,347 --> 00:32:19,849
who came to visit her--
Jordan Lowell.

00:32:19,849 --> 00:32:22,018
Please don't tell me she's
some sort of scam artist.

00:32:22,018 --> 00:32:23,920
No, ma'am.

00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,121
She's dead.

00:32:25,121 --> 00:32:26,656
She died in a plane
crash yesterday.

00:32:26,656 --> 00:32:27,991
Oh, my Lord.

00:32:27,991 --> 00:32:30,026
She was just here.

00:32:30,026 --> 00:32:32,028
Helen's father never visited.

00:32:32,028 --> 00:32:34,864
I understand he died
a few years ago.

00:32:34,864 --> 00:32:36,800
I had hoped that,
after all these years,

00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,836
that Helen had someone
who wasn't a stranger
to hold her hand.

00:32:44,574 --> 00:32:45,942
BRODY:
<i>Talk about a tragic story.</i>

00:32:45,942 --> 00:32:47,777
And an unlucky family.

00:32:47,777 --> 00:32:50,079
Well, someone in that family
had good fortune.

00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:52,582
I mean, you saw that place;
it's pretty high-end.

00:32:52,582 --> 00:32:55,018
40 years of constant care.

00:32:55,018 --> 00:32:56,486
It would cost a pretty penny.

00:32:56,486 --> 00:32:58,021
The kind of money
Joseph Jordan

00:32:58,021 --> 00:32:59,889
would amass over a lifetime.

00:32:59,889 --> 00:33:02,425
I looked into
Jordan's father.

00:33:02,425 --> 00:33:03,893
His family's owned
property in Nevada

00:33:03,893 --> 00:33:05,462
for over a century.

00:33:05,462 --> 00:33:07,096
He made a fortune
in ranching,

00:33:07,096 --> 00:33:09,098
mining,
and real estate.

00:33:09,098 --> 00:33:12,368
And when Joe Jordan died,
he left over $100 million

00:33:12,368 --> 00:33:14,504
in a trust to Helen.

00:33:14,504 --> 00:33:16,406
Does it say who
controls the trust now?

00:33:16,406 --> 00:33:18,141
No. Those terms
are confidential.

00:33:18,141 --> 00:33:21,478
But it looks like
the trust donates

00:33:21,478 --> 00:33:23,746
several million dollars
to a nonprofit

00:33:23,746 --> 00:33:25,949
home for the
disabled every year.

00:33:25,949 --> 00:33:28,885
Let me take a wild guess--
Tranquil Hours?

00:33:28,885 --> 00:33:30,353
Correct.

00:33:30,353 --> 00:33:31,921
So Tranquil Hours
is getting millions

00:33:31,921 --> 00:33:33,556
from Helen Jordan's estate.

00:33:33,556 --> 00:33:36,826
And then, one day,
Jordan Lowell shows up

00:33:36,826 --> 00:33:38,628
and takes a DNA sample
from Helen.

00:33:38,628 --> 00:33:40,563
Hoping to prove
she's part of the family

00:33:40,563 --> 00:33:42,565
and perhaps entitled
to a big share

00:33:42,565 --> 00:33:44,434
of her newfound inheritance.

00:33:44,434 --> 00:33:46,536
You thinking what I'm thinking?
(cell phone chimes)

00:33:46,536 --> 00:33:48,838
Tranquil Hours
saw Jordan as a threat.

00:33:50,507 --> 00:33:52,609
Just one problem
with our theory.

00:33:52,609 --> 00:33:55,411
You know the DNA sample
we took from Helen?

00:33:55,411 --> 00:33:58,882
Well, Henry just compared it
to Jordan Lowell's DNA.

00:33:58,882 --> 00:34:00,617
Helen and Jordan aren't sisters.

00:34:00,617 --> 00:34:01,918
(laughs)

00:34:01,918 --> 00:34:03,920
That's impossible,
Hojem-Sanders.

00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,489
I'm sorry, Donna,
but it's science.

00:34:06,489 --> 00:34:07,957
Your science, not mine.

00:34:09,859 --> 00:34:12,395
Mr. Russell,
my research is meticulous,

00:34:12,395 --> 00:34:14,063
my methods precise.

00:34:14,063 --> 00:34:16,533
I fact-check and verify
my information

00:34:16,533 --> 00:34:18,434
at every turn.

00:34:18,434 --> 00:34:22,939
I'd like to say I make mistakes,
but I don't make mistakes.

00:34:22,939 --> 00:34:26,709
Jordan Lowell's half-sister
was at Tranquil Hours.

00:34:26,709 --> 00:34:29,679
Donna, I'm sorry,
but science is science,

00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:32,482
and the DNA results show
conclusively that Helen Jordan

00:34:32,482 --> 00:34:34,784
and Jordan Lowell
are not half-sisters.

00:34:34,784 --> 00:34:37,053
They're not even
related.

00:34:37,053 --> 00:34:38,922
A little help here?

00:34:38,922 --> 00:34:40,623
Well, maybe you're both right.

00:34:40,623 --> 00:34:42,625
I mean, who's to say
that microfiche

00:34:42,625 --> 00:34:44,894
and microcentrifuges
don't mix?

00:34:44,894 --> 00:34:46,696
I don't know
what you're talking about.

00:34:46,696 --> 00:34:49,065
Finally, we agree.
Jordan Lowell
found her sister,

00:34:49,065 --> 00:34:50,600
Helen Jordan,
through genealogy.

00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,834
Right.

00:34:51,834 --> 00:34:53,503
But DNA proves that the woman

00:34:53,503 --> 00:34:56,372
she found at Tranquil Hours
was not her sister.

00:34:56,372 --> 00:34:58,775
Right.
So...

00:34:58,775 --> 00:35:01,511
what happened
to Jordan's sister?

00:35:01,511 --> 00:35:03,112
And who's the woman
pretending to be her

00:35:03,112 --> 00:35:04,414
at Tranquil Hours?

00:35:10,553 --> 00:35:13,556
Obviously, something happened
to the real Helen.

00:35:13,556 --> 00:35:15,358
Maybe she died.

00:35:15,358 --> 00:35:18,595
And maybe another patient was
substituted in Helen's place.

00:35:18,595 --> 00:35:19,963
Because the woman
that I met

00:35:19,963 --> 00:35:21,931
was definitely not pretending.

00:35:21,931 --> 00:35:23,132
All of which suggests

00:35:23,132 --> 00:35:24,767
a much wider conspiracy.

00:35:24,767 --> 00:35:26,936
Why the conspiracy?
Who benefits?

00:35:26,936 --> 00:35:28,771
Well, Tranquil Hours does get

00:35:28,771 --> 00:35:30,974
several million dollars a year
from Helen's trust.

00:35:30,974 --> 00:35:32,942
And if she dies,
the money dries up.

00:35:32,942 --> 00:35:34,644
It's a Social
Security scam.

00:35:34,644 --> 00:35:36,379
Until Jordan Lowell shows up

00:35:36,379 --> 00:35:37,814
and threatens
to expose all of that.

00:35:37,814 --> 00:35:39,649
But Jordan
showed up months ago.

00:35:39,649 --> 00:35:41,050
Why did someone wait
till yesterday

00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:42,652
to kill her
in a plane crash?

00:35:42,652 --> 00:35:44,554
Ah.

00:35:44,554 --> 00:35:45,888
The DNA kit.

00:35:45,888 --> 00:35:47,090
Right.

00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:48,891
Jordan swabs
the fake Helen,

00:35:48,891 --> 00:35:51,694
and that is when somebody
at Tranquil Hours got spooked--

00:35:51,694 --> 00:35:53,830
'cause they realized
they were about to be found out.

00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:57,800
So the question is: How wide
is this wider conspiracy?

00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,068
RUSSELL:
Don't know.

00:35:59,068 --> 00:36:00,603
But if I were you,

00:36:00,603 --> 00:36:02,005
I would start
with Helen's doctor.

00:36:06,376 --> 00:36:07,677
Excuse me.
Can I help you?

00:36:07,677 --> 00:36:09,379
Yeah, we're here
to see Dr. O'Keefe.

00:36:09,379 --> 00:36:10,747
She called in sick this morning.

00:36:10,747 --> 00:36:12,382
Big surprise.

00:36:12,382 --> 00:36:14,851
Uh, in that case,
we'd like to see Helen Jordan.

00:36:14,851 --> 00:36:16,653
We have a warrant
for her fingerprints.

00:36:16,653 --> 00:36:18,354
I'm sorry.

00:36:18,354 --> 00:36:20,356
Helen was transferred
to a critical care facility

00:36:20,356 --> 00:36:21,557
a few hours ago.

00:36:21,557 --> 00:36:22,825
Really? Where?

00:36:22,825 --> 00:36:24,527
You'd have to ask Dr. O'Keefe.

00:36:24,527 --> 00:36:27,030
Okay. Well, if her room
hasn't been transferred,

00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:28,431
we're going to need to see it.

00:36:41,711 --> 00:36:42,979
You smell that?

00:36:42,979 --> 00:36:44,447
Bleach.

00:36:44,447 --> 00:36:46,482
Mm-hmm.

00:36:51,788 --> 00:36:53,756
Not a speck of dust.

00:36:53,756 --> 00:36:55,725
No DNA, no trace,

00:36:55,725 --> 00:36:58,394
and probably
no fingerprints.

00:36:58,394 --> 00:36:59,662
SANDERS:
Hold that thought.

00:37:09,706 --> 00:37:11,774
Maybe we do have
Helen's fingerprint.

00:37:12,942 --> 00:37:14,544
They always miss something.

00:37:16,746 --> 00:37:17,914
Nick.
Yeah?

00:37:17,914 --> 00:37:19,549
Get this.

00:37:19,549 --> 00:37:21,417
Henry found a sibling match
between our killer

00:37:21,417 --> 00:37:22,919
and the impostor
in the wheelchair.

00:37:22,919 --> 00:37:24,921
What do you mean?
The swab we got
off our impostor

00:37:24,921 --> 00:37:26,923
has multiple alleles
in common with the DNA

00:37:26,923 --> 00:37:28,925
we pulled from the coveralls
of our saboteur.

00:37:28,925 --> 00:37:30,827
Mmm. So what? We still
don't have a name.

00:37:30,827 --> 00:37:32,695
We do.

00:37:32,695 --> 00:37:35,031
Print we got from the room
at Tranquil Hours comes back

00:37:35,031 --> 00:37:37,467
to a Marcia Forsythe.

00:37:37,467 --> 00:37:39,102
As in Jeffrey Forsythe?

00:37:39,102 --> 00:37:40,803
Well, he's the guy
who loaned his gun

00:37:40,803 --> 00:37:42,105
to the lawyer who
died in the crash.

00:37:42,105 --> 00:37:43,673
She's his sister.

00:37:43,673 --> 00:37:45,708
She had a skiing accident--
brain damage.

00:37:45,708 --> 00:37:46,909
He put her
in Tranquil Hours.

00:37:46,909 --> 00:37:48,544
He's the trustee
in charge

00:37:48,544 --> 00:37:49,779
of Helen Jordan's millions.

00:37:49,779 --> 00:37:51,514
Mmm. I'll call Brass.

00:37:51,514 --> 00:37:53,049
I already called
Forsythe's law firm.

00:37:53,049 --> 00:37:55,585
He's on his way out of town
for a business trip.

00:37:55,585 --> 00:37:56,819
Flying his own plane.

00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:01,390
(sirens wailing)

00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,695
(sirens stop, car doors opening)

00:38:07,029 --> 00:38:09,499
Are you going somewhere,
Mr. Forsythe?

00:38:09,499 --> 00:38:10,867
Is there a problem,
officers?

00:38:10,867 --> 00:38:12,368
I don't know.
Have you checked

00:38:12,368 --> 00:38:14,070
your cabin door seals lately?

00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:15,605
STOKES:
We know about your scam,

00:38:15,605 --> 00:38:17,974
siphoning millions
from Helen Jordan,

00:38:17,974 --> 00:38:20,810
enriching yourself
at her expense.

00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:22,645
And putting your sister
in her place

00:38:22,645 --> 00:38:23,846
whenever anyone came to visit.

00:38:23,846 --> 00:38:25,348
Oh, and by the way,
we found her

00:38:25,348 --> 00:38:26,949
stashed away
in another hospital.

00:38:26,949 --> 00:38:29,585
These are absurd
allegations.
I don't think so.

00:38:29,585 --> 00:38:30,787
We've arrested the good doctor,

00:38:30,787 --> 00:38:32,822
and she's confessed.

00:38:32,822 --> 00:38:35,458
So, perhaps there was
a little creative accounting.

00:38:35,458 --> 00:38:36,826
A victimless crime.

00:38:36,826 --> 00:38:39,462
That plane crash
wasn't victimless.

00:38:39,462 --> 00:38:42,031
You can't possibly think I had
anything to do with that.

00:38:42,031 --> 00:38:44,033
I already told you
my associate, Grant Abbott,

00:38:44,033 --> 00:38:46,769
had enemies--the type
that were capable

00:38:46,769 --> 00:38:48,571
of doing such heinous acts.

00:38:48,571 --> 00:38:50,006
Just stop, okay?

00:38:50,006 --> 00:38:51,908
We already know
that you persuaded Dr. O'Keefe

00:38:51,908 --> 00:38:54,377
to offer Jordan a free
charter flight to Chicago.

00:38:54,377 --> 00:38:55,845
Plus you had access.

00:38:55,845 --> 00:38:57,513
Got your plane
at the airport.

00:38:57,513 --> 00:38:59,015
You know, people
wouldn't think twice

00:38:59,015 --> 00:39:00,783
seeing you walk in
and out of the hangar.

00:39:00,783 --> 00:39:02,652
That's wildly speculative.

00:39:02,652 --> 00:39:04,387
DNA evidence isn't.
What DNA?

00:39:04,387 --> 00:39:05,655
Yours.

00:39:05,655 --> 00:39:07,123
Found on the coveralls
you were wearing

00:39:07,123 --> 00:39:09,892
when you sabotaged
the plane's cabin door.

00:39:09,892 --> 00:39:11,661
You're bluffing.

00:39:11,661 --> 00:39:13,696
You don't have a sample
of my DNA for comparison.

00:39:13,696 --> 00:39:14,931
We have your sister's.

00:39:14,931 --> 00:39:16,699
That's good enough.

00:39:16,699 --> 00:39:18,634
You killed five people
on that plane.

00:39:18,634 --> 00:39:20,736
It's just dumb luck you
didn't kill more on the ground.

00:39:20,736 --> 00:39:22,505
I hope you saved some
of the money you stole,

00:39:22,505 --> 00:39:23,706
because you're
going to need it

00:39:23,706 --> 00:39:25,408
to hire a lawyer
a lot smarter than you.

00:39:25,408 --> 00:39:26,609
Get him out of here.

00:39:26,609 --> 00:39:28,911
Okay.

00:39:28,911 --> 00:39:30,046
(handcuffs clicking)

00:39:35,451 --> 00:39:37,353
I heard you got your man.

00:39:37,353 --> 00:39:38,588
Yeah.

00:39:38,588 --> 00:39:40,456
Thanks to you.

00:39:40,456 --> 00:39:41,691
Little help from DNA.

00:39:41,691 --> 00:39:43,392
You don't see genealogy

00:39:43,392 --> 00:39:45,494
as a pure science,
do you, Mr. Russell?

00:39:45,494 --> 00:39:46,963
I wouldn't say that.

00:39:46,963 --> 00:39:48,564
It is, after all,

00:39:48,564 --> 00:39:50,700
a systematic pursuit
of knowledge, right?

00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,802
Seeking an understanding
of who we are

00:39:52,802 --> 00:39:54,737
and where we
came from.

00:39:54,737 --> 00:39:57,373
I mean, that sounds
like science to me.

00:39:57,373 --> 00:39:58,875
Maybe not pure, but...

00:39:58,875 --> 00:40:00,743
(laughs)
Well, if you ever need

00:40:00,743 --> 00:40:02,879
a little systematic
pursuit of knowledge,

00:40:02,879 --> 00:40:04,914
you know where
to find me.

00:40:04,914 --> 00:40:06,616
Bye-bye.

00:40:08,985 --> 00:40:10,586
DONNA:
What do you think?

00:40:10,586 --> 00:40:12,088
Donna, this is awesome.

00:40:12,088 --> 00:40:13,890
My dad is going to love it.

00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:15,992
I just love
that your family crest

00:40:15,992 --> 00:40:19,061
has an evergreen
and reindeer on it.

00:40:19,061 --> 00:40:21,998
It's perfect
for Christmas.
Perfect for Christmas.

00:40:21,998 --> 00:40:23,599
Anyone ever tell you two

00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:26,836
that you're really
very cute together?

00:40:26,836 --> 00:40:28,638
But, of course,
you'd want be careful.

00:40:28,638 --> 00:40:31,874
Because Ekli and Hojem-Sanders
are both Norwegian names.

00:40:31,874 --> 00:40:34,076
They could branch off
of the same family tree.

00:40:34,076 --> 00:40:35,945
Which would make you
kissing cousins.

00:40:39,048 --> 00:40:41,550
But...probably not.

00:40:45,888 --> 00:40:48,824
All right,
I'll see you in a bit.

00:40:48,824 --> 00:40:50,693
Cargo plane, San Jose.

00:40:50,693 --> 00:40:52,461
All hands on deck.

00:40:52,461 --> 00:40:53,729
No rest for the NTSB.

00:40:53,729 --> 00:40:55,531
Nope.

00:40:55,531 --> 00:40:57,466
So, I guess this is it.

00:40:57,466 --> 00:40:58,601
Yeah.

00:41:00,036 --> 00:41:03,472
Listen, about my, uh,
dinner offer...

00:41:03,472 --> 00:41:04,907
Oh.
It's just that...

00:41:06,375 --> 00:41:08,077
...seeing you again

00:41:08,077 --> 00:41:11,614
brought back a lot
of good memories, Sara.

00:41:11,614 --> 00:41:13,649
Honestly, it's kind of
annoying how great you look.

00:41:13,649 --> 00:41:15,751
(both laugh)

00:41:15,751 --> 00:41:17,086
Thanks.

00:41:17,086 --> 00:41:18,721
I'm glad things
worked out for you.

00:41:20,623 --> 00:41:21,857
You deserve it.

00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,628
Give my regards to the Bay.

00:41:25,628 --> 00:41:27,363
Will do.
