COACH:
Pass it, there you go.

00:00:06,338 --> 00:00:07,773
Get it in.

00:00:07,773 --> 00:00:08,974
Now get back, hustle back.

00:00:08,974 --> 00:00:10,776
Russell, hustle.

00:00:10,776 --> 00:00:13,946
Pass the ball, get rid of it.

00:00:13,946 --> 00:00:15,147
There you go.

00:00:15,147 --> 00:00:16,315
"D" up.

00:00:18,017 --> 00:00:19,218
Nicely done.

00:00:19,218 --> 00:00:20,686
There you go.

00:00:22,288 --> 00:00:24,723
Use your feet, Russell.
Use your feet.

Stay low...
Stay low!

Don't reach!

00:00:28,828 --> 00:00:30,229
What the hell
are you doing?

00:00:30,229 --> 00:00:31,997
I'm playing
"D," Coach.

00:00:31,997 --> 00:00:33,833
Try doing it
like you're not in high school.

00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:35,234
Coach...
You shut up.

00:00:37,303 --> 00:00:38,871
You sit your ass down.

00:00:38,871 --> 00:00:40,406
What, are you serious?

00:00:40,406 --> 00:00:43,209
You gonna cry
like a little bitch, huh?

00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:44,810
Get the hell off
my damn court.

00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:46,011
Hey, Charlie, Charlie.

00:00:46,011 --> 00:00:47,279
You want to ride
the bench

00:00:47,279 --> 00:00:49,148
for the rest
of the season, Russell?

00:00:55,721 --> 00:00:57,356
Tell Austin
this is a closed practice.

00:00:57,356 --> 00:00:59,358
He's the president
of the university

00:00:59,358 --> 00:01:01,794
and he's sitting next to the
guy whose name is on this gym.

00:01:01,794 --> 00:01:05,264
It's not his gym...
it's mine.

00:01:05,264 --> 00:01:07,233
Kick 'em both out.

00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:08,367
Now.

00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:17,743
(door squeaks, closes)

00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,759
Oh, look at that.

00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,128
I'm so glad you're home.

00:01:36,128 --> 00:01:38,063
Me too.

00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:41,433
No more bacon.

00:01:41,433 --> 00:01:42,935
What do you mean?

00:01:42,935 --> 00:01:44,703
Oh, please, you
think I don't know

00:01:44,703 --> 00:01:46,705
what you do when
I'm not here?

00:01:46,705 --> 00:01:49,074
I always said you were
a better detective than me.

00:01:49,074 --> 00:01:52,111
Oh, I think Charlie
has a girlfriend.

00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:53,946
What's your evidence?

00:01:53,946 --> 00:01:55,681
Laundry.

00:01:55,681 --> 00:01:57,182
He's bought new clothes,

00:01:57,182 --> 00:01:59,084
and they're not the kind
you play basketball in.

00:01:59,084 --> 00:02:00,286
They're the kind you...

00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:01,420
Wear to impress someone.

00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,988
And I saw him
washing his car.

00:02:02,988 --> 00:02:04,823
Oh, dear Lord,
must be serious.

00:02:04,823 --> 00:02:07,126
(phone rings)

00:02:07,126 --> 00:02:09,028
I'm sorry.

00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:11,997
Yeah, Jim, what's up?

00:02:11,997 --> 00:02:14,733
(shower running)
BRASS: And I'm gonna want to
talk to the maintenance guy...

00:02:14,733 --> 00:02:16,201
Yeah, I'll walk
over there with you.

00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:22,041
So the janitor found him
around 8:00 a.m.

00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:23,876
RUSSELL:
David, can I see him, please?

00:02:23,876 --> 00:02:25,044
Oh, yeah.

00:02:28,714 --> 00:02:31,250
RUSSELL:
Tom Burns was a hell of a coach.

00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:35,321
He started recruiting
Charlie in junior high.

00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,690
Charlie thought
the world of him.

00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,291
He's not the only one.

00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:41,961
Well, my guys said they
didn't touch anything,

00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:43,362
so it's all yours.

00:02:54,773 --> 00:02:56,041
Liver temp?

00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:58,744
Uh, 97 on the nose.

00:02:58,744 --> 00:03:02,214
Warm water,
naked body on cold tile.

00:03:02,214 --> 00:03:04,183
If my math's right,
couldn't be dead

00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:05,718
much more
than about three hours.

00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:07,319
So that puts
time of death around

00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:09,989
5:00, 5:15 a.m.

00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:11,357
Guy was an early riser.

00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:13,726
Yeah, old habits
die hard.

00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:15,194
He used to play ball
for West Point.

00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:16,829
He still gets up at
4:00 in the morning,

00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:18,130
jogs to the campus,

00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:20,232
works out, then jumps
in the pool for 30 laps.

00:03:20,232 --> 00:03:21,734
Be enough to kill me.

00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:25,838

SIDLE:
<i>So I talked to the janitor.</i>

00:04:05,244 --> 00:04:07,880
Place was cleaned up
and locked down by 1:00 a.m.

00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,081
Coach Burns
had a key.

00:04:09,081 --> 00:04:10,416
Yeah.

00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:14,686
Okay, so Coach Burns
finishes his workout

00:04:14,686 --> 00:04:16,388
and then he comes
to take a shower.

00:04:16,388 --> 00:04:18,123
Someone comes in

00:04:18,123 --> 00:04:19,725
and hits him
from behind.

00:04:19,725 --> 00:04:21,460
(grunts)

00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:25,097
First swing's always
for free, no blood.

00:04:25,097 --> 00:04:26,732
He goes down.

00:04:26,732 --> 00:04:28,400
Killer goes to town.

00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:32,404
Elongated blood drops suggest

00:04:32,404 --> 00:04:36,775
that it was at a low angle
and multiple blows.

00:04:36,775 --> 00:04:39,011
There's no sign
of the murder weapon anywhere.

00:04:39,011 --> 00:04:40,379
Took it with him.

00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:41,814
Looks like...

00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:43,248
someone tried to clean up

00:04:43,248 --> 00:04:46,852
to cover their tracks.

00:04:46,852 --> 00:04:48,053
Here you go.

00:04:49,855 --> 00:04:50,989
Could you hit the lights?

00:04:56,395 --> 00:04:58,730
Swipe marks.

00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:01,400
Arcing suggests the killer
backed out of the shower

00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,835
into the locker room.

00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:04,703
Covering his tracks.

00:05:04,703 --> 00:05:07,139
Then the cleanup stops,

00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:09,374
yeah, right about here.

00:05:09,374 --> 00:05:11,977
To the naked eye.
Hmm, not to ours.

00:05:11,977 --> 00:05:13,745
SIDLE:
Shoe impressions.

00:05:13,745 --> 00:05:15,681
Just the front half.

00:05:18,317 --> 00:05:20,886
Heading towards
the locker room exit.

00:05:22,354 --> 00:05:26,058
Spacing--
only the balls of the feet.

00:05:26,058 --> 00:05:28,160
Suggests running.
The other impressions--

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,928
also evenly
spaced, heading

00:05:29,928 --> 00:05:31,263
towards the door.

00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:33,265
It's an odd pattern.

00:05:33,265 --> 00:05:36,235
Sport shoe, maybe cleats?

00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:38,837
We might be looking
for more than one killer.

00:05:47,813 --> 00:05:49,748
Oh, wrong room,
I'm so sorry.

00:05:49,748 --> 00:05:51,316
Dad, what are
you doing here?

00:05:52,417 --> 00:05:55,020
Oh, hey, um,

00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,355
I would have called, but...

00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:57,756
Sorry.

00:05:57,756 --> 00:05:59,024
No, I'm sorry.

00:05:59,024 --> 00:06:01,026
You are Charlie's
dad, and I...

00:06:01,026 --> 00:06:04,296
This is so not how
I wanted us to meet.

00:06:04,296 --> 00:06:07,065
Dad, this is Vanessa,
my girlfriend.

00:06:07,065 --> 00:06:09,401
Think I got that part.

00:06:09,401 --> 00:06:11,837
So, what's going on?

00:06:11,837 --> 00:06:15,807
Charlie... (sighs heavily)
Coach Burns is dead.

00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,042
He's dead?

00:06:17,042 --> 00:06:18,243
Oh, my God.

00:06:18,243 --> 00:06:20,012
What happened?

00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:23,048
Actually, I'd like to talk
to you in private about that,

00:06:23,048 --> 00:06:24,950
if you don't mind.
VANESSA: Not at all.

00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,785
I'm so sorry.

00:06:26,785 --> 00:06:28,187
I'll call you
later, okay?

00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:29,421
CHARLIE:
Yeah.

00:06:29,421 --> 00:06:31,223
(door closes)

00:06:31,223 --> 00:06:33,192
Charlie, Coach
was murdered.

00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:34,893
What?

00:06:34,893 --> 00:06:36,261
Yeah.

00:06:40,065 --> 00:06:42,234
I'm so sorry.

00:06:42,234 --> 00:06:44,303
What happened?

00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:48,307
Do you know if any of
the players had a beef with him?

00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:51,777
All of us...
at one point or another.

00:06:51,777 --> 00:06:53,712
I mean, right or wrong,
we all think

00:06:53,712 --> 00:06:55,747
we're superstars
going to the NBA.

00:06:55,747 --> 00:06:57,349
Egos get out of hand,

00:06:57,349 --> 00:06:59,117
Coach slaps 'em down.

00:06:59,117 --> 00:07:01,687
Did he slap down
anyone in particular?

00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:03,755
Yeah, but it wasn't a player.

00:07:03,755 --> 00:07:05,724
Last night,
after practice,

00:07:05,724 --> 00:07:09,728
I, I was in the shower,
and I know it sounds weird,

00:07:09,728 --> 00:07:11,697
but I felt like,
like someone was there.

00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:13,398
I didn't see them,
but it was like they were

00:07:13,398 --> 00:07:15,968
watching me, like,
waiting for me to leave.

00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:18,070
Okay, w-what's this
have to do with Coach?

00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,805
Well, after I left
the gym,

00:07:19,805 --> 00:07:22,841
I, I had to come back
'cause I left my dorm key,

00:07:22,841 --> 00:07:24,977
and that's when
I heard them arguing--

00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:26,311
Coach and Jack Oxford.

00:07:26,311 --> 00:07:28,780
Oxford--the, the
deep pockets guy?

00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,249
Yeah, Mr. Hedge Fund.

00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:33,719
I put $8 million into this
school, into this program.

00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:35,187
I deserve some respect.

00:07:35,187 --> 00:07:37,256
Respect is earned,
not bought.

00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:39,024
CHARLIE: <i>I didn't hear much,</i>
<i>but, you know,</i>

00:07:39,024 --> 00:07:40,726
<i>money, the team--</i>

00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:43,028
the same crap
they always argue about.

00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:47,432
Okay, um, I got to get back.

00:07:47,432 --> 00:07:49,067
Come here, buddy;
come here.

00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:54,673
Oh, wait a minute now,

00:07:54,673 --> 00:07:57,142
the girlfriend--been
going together long?

00:07:57,142 --> 00:07:58,810
A couple months.
Oh.

00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:00,279
Thanks for sharing.

00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:01,680
Is she nice?

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,115
Yeah.

00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:04,349
Good.

00:08:04,349 --> 00:08:05,751
I'll call you.

00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:07,719
Yeah.

00:08:09,454 --> 00:08:12,457
STOKES: Those are some pretty
nasty head wounds there, Doc.

00:08:12,457 --> 00:08:14,393
Victim was struck
at least nine times

00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:15,794
to the head and the face.

00:08:15,794 --> 00:08:19,064
Fractured skull,
nose, cheekbone.

00:08:20,198 --> 00:08:22,334
And no defensive wounds.

00:08:22,334 --> 00:08:23,802
Guy never had a chance.

00:08:23,802 --> 00:08:26,305
Well, I found two different
wound patterns--

00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:28,707
one large and flat,

00:08:28,707 --> 00:08:30,409
the other small
and triangular.

00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:34,379
The large wounds have clean
margins, show signs of caving.

00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:36,281
The smaller ones are
deeper and sharper.

00:08:36,281 --> 00:08:38,250
So two different
weapons or

00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,218
one weapon used
two different ways?

00:08:40,218 --> 00:08:42,054
I can't tell you,
but what I can tell you is,

00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:44,690
our victim was no stranger
to violence lately.

00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,091
What do you mean?

00:08:46,091 --> 00:08:47,726
Well, his left nares had

00:08:47,726 --> 00:08:50,095
clotted blood from
a recent antemortem injury.

00:08:50,095 --> 00:08:52,731
So someone punched
him in the nose

00:08:52,731 --> 00:08:54,900
before his head
got caved in?

00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,935
By several hours,
I'd say.

00:08:56,935 --> 00:09:00,272
I found injuries
that even predate that.

00:09:00,272 --> 00:09:01,707
STOKES:
Bruising.

00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,208
How long ago do
you think this was?

00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:04,810
Two or three days.

00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:09,081
David found this
when he was washing the body--

00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:11,183
a dried substance
on the forehead.

00:09:11,183 --> 00:09:13,318
He took a swab,
sent it off to DNA.

00:09:13,318 --> 00:09:16,388
Circular, gravitational.

00:09:16,388 --> 00:09:18,390
I can tell you what it
looks like from here.

00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,459
I didn't find any evidence
of sexual assault.

00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:24,696
You know, sometimes a beating
is just a beating.

00:09:24,696 --> 00:09:27,432
OXFORD:
<i>Yeah, Burns and I got into it.</i>
<i>So what?</i>

00:09:27,432 --> 00:09:29,034
We had some things to discuss.

00:09:29,034 --> 00:09:31,136
Like what?

00:09:31,136 --> 00:09:32,771
None of your business.

00:09:32,771 --> 00:09:34,373
You know, a witness
at last night's practice

00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:36,875
told us the coach had you
and the university president

00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:39,111
kicked out of the gym.

00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:40,312
Your gym.

00:09:40,312 --> 00:09:41,980
Damn right it's my gym.

00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,782
That'd make me mad.

00:09:43,782 --> 00:09:46,151
Well, that's the difference
between you and me.

00:09:46,151 --> 00:09:50,956
I manage a hedge fund
worth $9 billion.

00:09:50,956 --> 00:09:54,760
This watch--probably worth
more than you make in a year.

00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,328
I don't get mad,
Detective;

00:09:56,328 --> 00:09:58,096
I get what I want.

00:09:58,096 --> 00:09:59,731
And did you want
Coach Burns dead

00:09:59,731 --> 00:10:02,834
in the shower--
this morning--of your gym?

00:10:02,834 --> 00:10:04,403
What's the upside in that?

00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:06,905
All the millions of dollars
I put into this program...

00:10:06,905 --> 00:10:08,273
Killing the
head coach--

00:10:08,273 --> 00:10:10,242
not exactly
a shrewd business strategy.

00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:11,443
What's your point?

00:10:11,443 --> 00:10:13,311
When a naked
basketball coach

00:10:13,311 --> 00:10:18,683
gets beaten to death in the
showers, it's not a good thing.

00:10:18,683 --> 00:10:20,152
Your compassion
is overwhelming.

00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:22,053
And so is your
incompetence,

00:10:22,053 --> 00:10:24,322
because every minute
you spend in here with me

00:10:24,322 --> 00:10:26,825
is a minute you could be
out there looking for the guy

00:10:26,825 --> 00:10:28,860
that did this.

00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,963
Why, look at that,
I have to go.

00:10:34,366 --> 00:10:35,734
Don't go far.

00:10:39,037 --> 00:10:41,807
Well, you were right,
Madame Poirot, about our son.

00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:44,009
I just met his girlfriend.

00:10:44,009 --> 00:10:45,944
Charlie said
you walked in on them.

00:10:45,944 --> 00:10:47,879
(laughing): Did he?
Yeah, yeah, I did.

00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:49,314
Remember, we were supposed
to have dinner tonight.

00:10:49,314 --> 00:10:50,715
Really?

00:10:50,715 --> 00:10:52,150
I thought, with everything

00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,852
that's going on,
maybe he'd reschedule.

00:10:53,852 --> 00:10:55,987
I guess he has other things
on his mind.

00:10:55,987 --> 00:10:58,890
He asked me to set
another place at the table.

00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:00,859
She's a vegetarian.

00:11:00,859 --> 00:11:03,462
Well, I guess she'll fit
right in, then, huh?

00:11:09,868 --> 00:11:13,338

00:11:18,743 --> 00:11:19,945

(whirring)

00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,335
Hey, Henry.

00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:46,137
Hey, uh, bloody towels
were a match to Coach Burns.

00:11:46,137 --> 00:11:48,206
Definitely what was used
to clean up the crime scene.

00:11:48,206 --> 00:11:49,941
No more locker room
laundry.

00:11:49,941 --> 00:11:52,410
I just went through three carts
of dirty towels.

00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:54,079
This whole place
smells like feet.

00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:58,083
Now it is going to smell
like something else.

00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:00,752
(sighs) Give me the ruler.
And you might
want to borrow

00:12:00,752 --> 00:12:02,220
some of Russell's incense.

00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,688
Pretty ripe.

00:12:03,688 --> 00:12:06,858
(sighs)
Wait.

00:12:06,858 --> 00:12:08,260
That's blood spatter.

00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,828
Medium velocity.

00:12:09,828 --> 00:12:12,864
Well, that's not from
any kind of cleanup.

00:12:12,864 --> 00:12:14,366
Spatter like that
only gets on someone

00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:15,734
one way.

00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:17,002
I think we have a suspect.

00:12:22,107 --> 00:12:24,442
BRASS:
You really ought to do
your own laundry, kid.

00:12:24,442 --> 00:12:27,112
RUSSELL:
We tested the blood
on your jersey, T.J.,

00:12:27,112 --> 00:12:29,114
and it matches
the coach.

00:12:29,114 --> 00:12:31,449
It's also the same as the blood
that was on the towels

00:12:31,449 --> 00:12:34,185
that were used to try to wipe up
the killer's footprints.

00:12:34,185 --> 00:12:36,755
We know that Coach Burns kept
a tight schedule, predictable.

00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:37,956
Whoever killed him knew that.

00:12:37,956 --> 00:12:39,791
And knew their way
around the gym.

00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:41,960
Burns was a hard-ass,
we all know that.

00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:45,430
Maybe he got what
was coming to him.
No.

00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:49,034
I mean, yeah, Coach is tough.

00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:50,735
And sometimes
that was hard, but...

00:12:50,735 --> 00:12:52,070
I respected him.

00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:55,140
I'd never...

00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,875
I understand.

00:12:56,875 --> 00:13:00,111
Charlie's on the team;
I've heard all the stories.

00:13:00,111 --> 00:13:02,981
But maybe there's something
that we don't know about.

00:13:02,981 --> 00:13:05,717
Like what?
BRASS: Well,
whoever killed him

00:13:05,717 --> 00:13:07,786
had a lot of rage.

00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:10,855
Beating a man
naked in the shower...

00:13:10,855 --> 00:13:12,724
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
whoa, wait a minute.

00:13:12,724 --> 00:13:15,760
If you're suggesting
what I think you are, n-no way.

00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,429
Coach wasn't like that.

00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:19,397
And I wasn't anywhere
near the gym this morning.

00:13:19,397 --> 00:13:21,967
How do you explain
the blood on your jersey?

00:13:23,368 --> 00:13:26,404
Come on, T.J., you got
to tell us something here.

00:13:26,404 --> 00:13:29,407
Otherwise, we won't
be able to help you.

00:13:29,407 --> 00:13:31,142
(sighs)

00:13:31,142 --> 00:13:34,012
Last night, after practice,

00:13:34,012 --> 00:13:36,214
there was a fight
in the locker room.

00:13:36,214 --> 00:13:37,882
Somebody threw
a punch at Coach.

00:13:37,882 --> 00:13:40,418
I stepped in to
try to stop it.

00:13:40,418 --> 00:13:43,121
That's how the blood
got on my jersey.

00:13:43,121 --> 00:13:45,357
Okay. All right, thank you.

00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:46,958
Who threw the punch?

00:13:51,229 --> 00:13:52,964
Your son.

00:14:00,238 --> 00:14:02,774
I need more focus, Russell.

00:14:02,774 --> 00:14:05,443
Commitment. The goal is
to chase titles, not girls.

00:14:05,443 --> 00:14:07,045
Excuse me?
Look, ever
since you've

00:14:07,045 --> 00:14:08,279
started dating that tramp--

00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:10,215
what's her name?
Vanessa...

00:14:10,215 --> 00:14:11,683
Don't talk about her like that.

00:14:11,683 --> 00:14:13,985
That's what she is, right?
A tramp.

00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:18,723
BURNS:
You're done!

00:14:18,723 --> 00:14:19,858
You're done.

00:14:23,161 --> 00:14:24,896
What T.J. told you was true.

00:14:24,896 --> 00:14:27,132
I... I did take
a swing at the coach.

00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:28,967
Where were you
this morning, Charlie?

00:14:28,967 --> 00:14:31,736
Um... got up early, 5:00 a.m.

00:14:31,736 --> 00:14:33,204
Went to the stadium, ran steps.

00:14:33,204 --> 00:14:35,140
Can anyone verify
your whereabouts?

00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,975
Is that really necessary?

00:14:36,975 --> 00:14:38,710
Yes, it is.

00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:42,147
Um... nobody saw me
at the stadium,

00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:44,015
but Vanessa was here
when I woke up.

00:14:44,015 --> 00:14:45,817
She saw me leave.

00:14:45,817 --> 00:14:47,318
I was working out

00:14:47,318 --> 00:14:48,887
for an hour and a half.

00:14:48,887 --> 00:14:50,422
Then I met up with her
for breakfast.

00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:51,990
Who's Vanessa?

00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:54,159
It's his girlfriend.
D.B.

00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:56,027
Who's Vanessa,
Charlie?

00:14:56,027 --> 00:14:58,463
Vanessa Drake.
She's a student.

00:14:58,463 --> 00:15:00,699
A grad student.
Psychology.

00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:02,233
I can give you
her number.
(phone beeping)

00:15:02,233 --> 00:15:04,903
Yeah, I'm gonna need that.
Hold on, I'm getting a text.

00:15:04,903 --> 00:15:06,838
Coach Burns' wife
just got back

00:15:06,838 --> 00:15:08,773
into town--
she was in Tahoe.

00:15:08,773 --> 00:15:10,175
I'm going to interview
her at the P.D.

00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:12,343
Okay, we're
all done here, Charlie.

00:15:12,343 --> 00:15:14,079
But you understand
the seriousness

00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,380
of this, right?
We have to follow

00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:18,116
every possible lead--
don't go anywhere.

00:15:19,684 --> 00:15:20,885
(door opens)

00:15:20,885 --> 00:15:22,087
(door closes)

00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:24,389
Look, Dad, it...
it's not like

00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:26,925
I didn't want to tell you
about what happened with Coach.

00:15:26,925 --> 00:15:28,960
And besides, I didn't
think it was pertinent.

00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,161
Pertinent?

00:15:30,161 --> 00:15:31,696
The man was murdered, Charlie,

00:15:31,696 --> 00:15:33,932
hours after you
physically assaulted him!

00:15:33,932 --> 00:15:35,667
What could be
more pertinent than that?

00:15:35,667 --> 00:15:37,435
I punched him.
He deserved it.

00:15:37,435 --> 00:15:39,738
You know, that's
another conversation.

00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:42,674
Right now my problem is,
you are a suspect

00:15:42,674 --> 00:15:45,110
in a homicide investigation.

00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,945
I mean, you know what
really pisses me off?

00:15:46,945 --> 00:15:48,279
I had to find out about that

00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:50,381
from a witness
in an interrogation room.

00:15:50,381 --> 00:15:53,785
Am I really a suspect?
Yeah, you are. You lied.

00:15:53,785 --> 00:15:55,320
I didn't lie;
I just didn't tell you.

00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,755
Don't--don't do that.
Come on.

00:15:56,755 --> 00:15:59,090
We didn't raise you like that.

00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:00,992
How many times
have I told you,
there's nothing

00:16:00,992 --> 00:16:02,327
that could happen in the world

00:16:02,327 --> 00:16:04,095
that you couldn't come
and tell me about.

00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:06,264
You also told me
to be my own person,

00:16:06,264 --> 00:16:08,733
to fight my own fights,
to live my own life, Dad.

00:16:08,733 --> 00:16:11,169
If you don't know the difference
between being independent

00:16:11,169 --> 00:16:13,238
and being honest, then
I don't know what to say to you.

00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:15,240
I really don't.

00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,843
(door opens, shuts)

00:16:18,843 --> 00:16:20,812
(footsteps clopping)

00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,827
BRODY:
Something's different about you.

00:16:37,395 --> 00:16:39,297
Did you get a haircut?

00:16:39,297 --> 00:16:41,900
Heels.

00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,301
Something you want to tell me?

00:16:43,301 --> 00:16:44,969
Yes.

00:16:44,969 --> 00:16:48,306
I have identified... one
set of shoe impressions

00:16:48,306 --> 00:16:50,141
from our crime scene.
Heels.

00:16:50,141 --> 00:16:53,311
Sara was right--
running from the scene.
Fast women.

00:16:53,311 --> 00:16:55,713
Always dangerous.

00:16:55,713 --> 00:16:57,315
What about the other
shoe impressions?

00:16:57,315 --> 00:16:59,384
Well, Finlay seems
to think that they're

00:16:59,384 --> 00:17:01,686
from some sort
of athletic shoe or a cleat.

00:17:01,686 --> 00:17:03,388
So far...

00:17:03,388 --> 00:17:05,356
I got nothing.
Well, you know,
the database is

00:17:05,356 --> 00:17:07,091
only updated every six months,

00:17:07,091 --> 00:17:10,695
so there's probably some
that aren't in there yet.

00:17:10,695 --> 00:17:12,764
Mm.
You might have
to go on a shopping spree.

00:17:12,764 --> 00:17:13,965
Want to go with?

00:17:13,965 --> 00:17:15,400
Sure.

00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,969
But isn't there one stop
you need to make first?

00:17:17,969 --> 00:17:19,304
Where's that?

00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:23,241
Charlie Russell
is a suspect, so...

00:17:23,241 --> 00:17:25,043
you're gonna have
to raid his closet

00:17:25,043 --> 00:17:28,847
and... you're gonna have
to clear it with his dad.

00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:31,749
Hmm. Not a good day
to ask for a raise.

00:17:31,749 --> 00:17:33,351
Mrs. Burns...

00:17:33,351 --> 00:17:35,353
I'm sorry for your loss.

00:17:35,353 --> 00:17:37,355
I need to ask you
some questions.

00:17:37,355 --> 00:17:39,324
I understand.
Now, you said

00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:40,758
you were in Tahoe last night.

00:17:40,758 --> 00:17:42,260
I went up there on Wednesday

00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,928
to close up our cabin.

00:17:43,928 --> 00:17:46,364
Once basketball season starts,
there's really no time

00:17:46,364 --> 00:17:47,966
for weekend getaways.

00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:50,201
I got back
this afternoon--

00:17:50,201 --> 00:17:52,136
that's when
I got your message.

00:17:52,136 --> 00:17:53,771
About Tom.

00:17:53,771 --> 00:17:56,341
So when was the last
time you two spoke?

00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:57,842
A few days ago.

00:17:59,043 --> 00:18:00,345
I know what you're thinking,

00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:01,980
but for us, that was normal.

00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,015
Especially
at this time of year.

00:18:04,015 --> 00:18:07,218
Tom was always so focused
on getting ready for the season.

00:18:07,218 --> 00:18:10,922
So no problems with
your marriage, then?

00:18:10,922 --> 00:18:13,358
We had our struggles,
but unlike most men,

00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:15,994
he was at least willing
to work on our relationship,

00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:17,295
go to couples therapy.

00:18:17,295 --> 00:18:19,197
How was that working out?

00:18:19,197 --> 00:18:21,165
It was good.

00:18:21,165 --> 00:18:23,401
Things were...

00:18:23,401 --> 00:18:25,937
improving.

00:18:25,937 --> 00:18:29,274
Mrs. Burns, I'm gonna need
a sample of your DNA

00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:32,410
and permission
to search your house.

00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:34,245
It's standard procedure.

00:18:34,245 --> 00:18:37,115
I didn't kill my husband,
Detective.

00:18:37,115 --> 00:18:38,716

Sure.

00:18:42,086 --> 00:18:46,257
RUSSELL:
This is some of the stuff
we found in Coach Burns' house.

00:18:46,257 --> 00:18:48,993
You're sure these, uh...

00:18:48,993 --> 00:18:51,362
these, these things
belonged to him?

00:18:51,362 --> 00:18:55,433
These sex toys?
FINLAY: We definitely found them
in Coach Burns' house.

00:18:55,433 --> 00:18:57,769
Actually, in his man cave
in the basement.

00:18:57,769 --> 00:19:00,171
His wife said that
it was a home office.

00:19:00,171 --> 00:19:02,307
I'm assuming you had
no idea about his hobby.

00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,676
No, of course not.
Right.

00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:07,011
I-I assume you'll be,
uh, discreet about this.

00:19:07,011 --> 00:19:08,446
This sort
of information

00:19:08,446 --> 00:19:11,849
could do irreparable damage
to the university.

00:19:11,849 --> 00:19:13,751
I understand your concern,
and I share it--

00:19:13,751 --> 00:19:15,987
my son goes to your school--
but our job's

00:19:15,987 --> 00:19:17,355
not to protect the university,

00:19:17,355 --> 00:19:19,824
it's to find out
who killed the coach.

00:19:19,824 --> 00:19:21,259
I thought I knew the man.

00:19:21,259 --> 00:19:22,961
Well, so did I.

00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:25,830
Thanks for your time,
President Austin.
Thank you.

00:19:27,732 --> 00:19:30,301
(groans) Okay, uh...
(sighs)

00:19:30,301 --> 00:19:31,703
what else did you find?

00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:33,271
I ALS'd the bedroom.

00:19:33,271 --> 00:19:35,039
It lit up like the Strip.

00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,675
Well, his wife was away
for several days, she said.

00:19:37,675 --> 00:19:39,377
Yeah, when the wife's away,
the coach will play.

00:19:39,377 --> 00:19:41,079
Tell Henry to get to work.

00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:44,349

You're
very welcome.

So, Vanessa, are you
a graduate student?

00:19:51,389 --> 00:19:53,458
Going for my master's
in psychology.

00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:54,859
I assume, in your work,

00:19:54,859 --> 00:19:56,160
psychology often
comes into play?

00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,229
Yeah, yeah, I'm usually dealing

00:19:58,229 --> 00:20:00,965

like this?
Actually, I can't talk about

00:25:30,761 --> 00:25:32,296
I have nothing more to say.

00:25:32,296 --> 00:25:35,800
Well, you know, we could
drive you downtown... Vanessa.

00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,703
We could book you
for solicitation.

00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,771
I am not a hooker, Mr. Russell.

00:25:40,771 --> 00:25:41,972
No? What are you then?

00:25:41,972 --> 00:25:43,207
I am a licensed sex therapist,

00:25:43,207 --> 00:25:45,109
which, aside from being
perfectly legal,

00:25:45,109 --> 00:25:47,712
also entitles me
to therapist-patient privilege.

00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:49,246
I don't have
to tell you anything.

00:25:49,246 --> 00:25:51,048
So you're telling me
that all these women

00:25:51,048 --> 00:25:53,384
running around in here
are licensed therapists?

00:25:53,384 --> 00:25:55,953
Yes, they are.
You can book a session

00:25:55,953 --> 00:25:58,189
with any one of them
if you feel the need.

00:25:58,189 --> 00:26:01,692
Does my son know what you do?

00:26:01,692 --> 00:26:03,728
Like I said...

00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:05,062
I have nothing more to say.

00:26:14,271 --> 00:26:16,273
Oh, I didn't hear you
come in last night.

00:26:16,273 --> 00:26:17,675
(grunts)

00:26:17,675 --> 00:26:19,076
Didn't want to wake you.

00:26:19,076 --> 00:26:21,078
(gentle laugh)
Hey.

00:26:22,813 --> 00:26:24,348
I was up all night...

00:26:24,348 --> 00:26:27,184
thinking about Charlie,
Vanessa.

00:26:27,184 --> 00:26:29,453
I'm with you on that one.

00:26:29,453 --> 00:26:31,889
Just seems so early
for them to move in together.

00:26:31,889 --> 00:26:33,224
They barely know each other.

00:26:33,224 --> 00:26:36,861
Did you run the
dishwasher last night?

00:26:36,861 --> 00:26:38,295
No.
Why?

00:26:38,295 --> 00:26:40,398
Just asking.

00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:41,899
I guess that's
the danger

00:26:41,899 --> 00:26:44,268
of raising an independent child.

00:26:44,268 --> 00:26:45,936
You might actually succeed.

00:26:45,936 --> 00:26:47,671
I guess it is

00:26:47,671 --> 00:26:49,874
their decision to make, right?

00:26:49,874 --> 00:26:52,810
I mean, where would we be
if we'd waited for my parents

00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:55,346
to approve of you?

00:26:55,346 --> 00:26:57,348
Is that's Vanessa's
wine glass?

00:26:57,348 --> 00:27:01,719
You are not seriously
going to run her DNA?

00:27:01,719 --> 00:27:03,387
Are you gonna do
a background check?

00:27:03,387 --> 00:27:06,223
Trust me on this one,
Detective.

00:27:06,223 --> 00:27:07,858
What does that mean?

00:27:07,858 --> 00:27:09,727
It means trust me.

00:27:09,727 --> 00:27:11,128
I'll call you.

00:27:13,264 --> 00:27:17,935
I just had
the strangest experience.

00:27:17,935 --> 00:27:20,738
I found Henry
swabbing a wine glass

00:27:20,738 --> 00:27:23,007
that you quietly slipped him

00:27:23,007 --> 00:27:26,243
in order to obtain
a potential suspect's DNA.

00:27:26,243 --> 00:27:28,979
I hope you got a warrant,
because, as I recall,

00:27:28,979 --> 00:27:31,015
I was fired
by my boss in Seattle

00:27:31,015 --> 00:27:32,917
for doing the exact same thing.

00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:35,252
Are you through?
No, no, no, no.

00:27:35,252 --> 00:27:38,956
I have a lot more things
I'd like to say.
'Cause it's not the same thing.

00:27:38,956 --> 00:27:41,225
It's my wine glass in my house,

00:27:41,225 --> 00:27:42,993
and-and-and the DNA
happens to come

00:27:42,993 --> 00:27:45,029
from a hooker
who's banging my son.

00:27:45,029 --> 00:27:46,964
So, no, not the same thing.

00:27:49,066 --> 00:27:50,901
Well, your suspicions
were confirmed.

00:27:50,901 --> 00:27:54,939
What do you mean?
The DNA matched
our unknown female.

00:27:54,939 --> 00:27:58,709
Vanessa was definitely
sleeping with the coach.

00:27:58,709 --> 00:28:00,311
That's great.

00:28:00,311 --> 00:28:02,880
So, my-my son is in a love
triangle involving his coach,

00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,315
who, you know, he happened

00:28:04,315 --> 00:28:05,950
to have a violent
confrontation with

00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:08,385
just hours before
the man was killed, and...

00:28:08,385 --> 00:28:12,122
shoe impressions
at the scene suggest a woman

00:28:12,122 --> 00:28:14,425
and somebody else,
and the someone else's footwear

00:28:14,425 --> 00:28:15,893
looks like
it could be an athlete.

00:28:15,893 --> 00:28:17,461
So it just gets better
and better.

00:28:17,461 --> 00:28:20,698
Hodges analyzed all of Charlie's
shoes, and none of them

00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:23,467
fit the mystery pattern.

00:28:23,467 --> 00:28:26,237
D.B., I've known your son
since he was ten.

00:28:26,237 --> 00:28:29,139
There is no way
that he is a killer.

00:28:29,139 --> 00:28:30,341
(sighs)

00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:33,210
I--I know that.
I know that.

00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:35,012
But he's keeping
something from me.

00:28:35,012 --> 00:28:36,780
And you know, it
wouldn't be the first time

00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:39,450
some idiot kid did
something stupid for love.

00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:42,019
Do you think
he's lying to protect Vanessa?

00:28:42,019 --> 00:28:43,888
I have no idea, but
I'll tell you something.

00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,322
If he wasn't my son,

00:28:45,322 --> 00:28:47,458
he'd be sitting in
a jail cell right now.

00:28:47,458 --> 00:28:49,360
We need to figure this out.

00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,795
We don't even have
a murder weapon yet.

00:28:51,795 --> 00:28:53,397
And there are so many suspects
still in play.

00:28:53,397 --> 00:28:55,266
What are we missing?
We're missing something.

00:28:55,266 --> 00:28:57,001
What is this?

00:28:57,001 --> 00:28:59,136
What's the white substance
on the coach's forehead?

00:28:59,136 --> 00:29:01,438
It's a biological,
but that's about it.

00:29:01,438 --> 00:29:03,007
Henry ran a quant,
and there wasn't

00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:05,809
sufficient DNA
to even generate a profile.

00:29:05,809 --> 00:29:08,279
What about Trace?

00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:10,114
Um, Hodges,
I asked you a question.

00:29:10,114 --> 00:29:13,083
Yes. And I heard you.

00:29:15,786 --> 00:29:17,988
Struck out again.

00:29:19,723 --> 00:29:21,358
Okay, uh... what did you ask me?

00:29:21,358 --> 00:29:22,760
The dried substance?

00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,228
Oh.

00:29:24,228 --> 00:29:25,462
Yeah. It's all in there.

00:29:25,462 --> 00:29:28,365
I know you were
counting on semen.

00:29:28,365 --> 00:29:30,434
It was a teardrop?

00:29:30,434 --> 00:29:33,304
Not just any teardrop--
an emotional one.

00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:35,072
An emotional teardrop?
Seriously?

00:29:35,072 --> 00:29:37,041
I mean, how can you even
tell that? That's...

00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:38,842
Science.

00:29:38,842 --> 00:29:40,878
<i>Emotional tears have</i>
<i>a different composition</i>

00:29:40,878 --> 00:29:43,314
<i>than irritant-induced tears.</i>

00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:46,116
<i>Emotional tears exhibit</i>
<i>25% higher concentrations</i>

00:29:46,116 --> 00:29:50,120
<i>in proteins, enzymes, lipids,</i>
<i>lysozymes, and electrolytes.</i>

00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,756
So, someone cried
over the victim.

00:29:52,756 --> 00:29:54,191
I'm not sure how
that helps us.

00:29:54,191 --> 00:29:57,094
Refer to page four.

00:29:57,094 --> 00:29:59,363
Perhaps the
owner of our tear

00:29:59,363 --> 00:30:01,298
was not only
mourning Coach Burns,

00:30:01,298 --> 00:30:05,336
but also mourning
a lost vigor of lash.

00:30:05,336 --> 00:30:07,137
Tear contained bimatoprost?

00:30:07,137 --> 00:30:08,839
A synthetic prostaglandin

00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:10,808
and a key component
in a prescription drug

00:30:10,808 --> 00:30:12,776
that helps promote
eyelash growth.

00:30:12,776 --> 00:30:14,845
Longessa.

00:30:14,845 --> 00:30:17,915
Does that help you?
Yes, it does. Thank you.

00:30:24,188 --> 00:30:26,023
(Hodges sighs)

00:30:26,023 --> 00:30:27,758
Damn it.

00:30:27,758 --> 00:30:29,460
You ever think
maybe not a shoe?

00:30:34,298 --> 00:30:35,466
I hate you.

00:30:39,403 --> 00:30:40,804
(sighs)

00:30:44,808 --> 00:30:46,677
What's this?
Longessa.

00:30:46,677 --> 00:30:49,246
Found a six-month supply when
we searched the Burns' home.

00:30:49,246 --> 00:30:50,681
Eyelash ointment.

00:30:50,681 --> 00:30:51,949
Uh-huh.

00:30:51,949 --> 00:30:54,318
Prescribed to Mrs. Burns.

00:30:54,318 --> 00:30:55,853
You know that dried substance
that we found

00:30:55,853 --> 00:30:57,287
on the coach's
forehead?

00:30:57,287 --> 00:31:00,224
Well, turns out it was a tear
with traces of Longessa.

00:31:00,224 --> 00:31:02,192
That puts the wife
in the shower,

00:31:02,192 --> 00:31:04,194
standing over
her dead husband's body.

00:31:04,194 --> 00:31:06,797
Question is, who was she with?

00:31:06,797 --> 00:31:09,199
Well, I checked the Burns'
cell phone records.

00:31:09,199 --> 00:31:11,235
There's a consistent pattern
of calls

00:31:11,235 --> 00:31:13,804
between Mrs. Burns
and Jack Oxford.

00:31:13,804 --> 00:31:15,039
Oxford?
Mm.

00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,874
WLVU's favorite booster?

00:31:16,874 --> 00:31:20,077
Well, maybe he was
boosting something else.

00:31:20,077 --> 00:31:22,680
Oxford sleeping
with the coach's wife,

00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,848
but the coach has his own thing
going on with Vanessa.

00:31:24,848 --> 00:31:26,050
Everybody should be happy.

00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,718
In theory.

00:31:27,718 --> 00:31:30,020
But, uh, simple math gets
complicated sometimes,

00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,221
when passions are involved.

00:31:31,221 --> 00:31:33,924
Okay, I'll call Brass.

00:31:33,924 --> 00:31:36,694
I think it's time we talk
to the booster and the widow.

00:31:36,694 --> 00:31:40,464
Go get 'em.

00:31:40,464 --> 00:31:42,032
Jim?

00:31:42,032 --> 00:31:43,834
Yeah, Nick, I hear you.

00:31:43,834 --> 00:31:45,669
I'll send some officers
to Burns' house

00:31:45,669 --> 00:31:47,705
to pick up his wife.

00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:49,673
But as far
as grabbing Jack Oxford

00:31:49,673 --> 00:31:51,241
and taking him to the station,

00:31:51,241 --> 00:31:53,343
that's not gonna happen.

00:31:53,343 --> 00:31:55,446
Somebody took him
out of the game.

00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:01,452
BRASS:
Ouch. That's a one-and-one.

00:32:01,452 --> 00:32:03,120
Must have been in the penalty.

00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,290
Two shots fired from a gun
registered to you.

00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:08,058
Recovered from a trash can

00:32:08,058 --> 00:32:09,693
right outside the gym.

00:32:09,693 --> 00:32:11,795
BRASS:
So, thanks for making
our job so easy.

00:32:11,795 --> 00:32:14,765
To put a bullet
in a guy's manhood--

00:32:14,765 --> 00:32:17,067
good luck with a jury.

00:32:17,067 --> 00:32:19,036
You sure you don't want
to call your lawyer now?

00:32:19,036 --> 00:32:20,704
I don't need a lawyer,

00:32:20,704 --> 00:32:22,973
because I haven't
done anything wrong.

00:32:22,973 --> 00:32:24,875
In the eyes of God?

00:32:24,875 --> 00:32:26,343
I don't think so.

00:32:26,343 --> 00:32:28,145
State of Nevada
looks pretty bad too.

00:32:28,145 --> 00:32:29,446
SANDERS:
Phone calls between

00:32:29,446 --> 00:32:31,749
you and Oxford.

00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:35,052
DNA from his house
puts you in his bed.

00:32:35,052 --> 00:32:36,353
Now, as far as

00:32:36,353 --> 00:32:38,021
your husband's murder...

00:32:38,021 --> 00:32:39,423
Shoes from your closet match

00:32:39,423 --> 00:32:41,258
shoe impressions from the scene.

00:32:41,258 --> 00:32:45,129
And Trace report says that
you shed a tear over his body.

00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:46,363
BRASS:
How touching.

00:32:46,363 --> 00:32:47,765
And incriminating.

00:32:47,765 --> 00:32:49,733
I didn't kill anyone.

00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:54,304
But I was there
at the gym that morning.

00:32:54,304 --> 00:32:57,341
Yes, I was having
an affair with Oxford.

00:32:57,341 --> 00:32:59,877
It was just a fling.

00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:02,179
I knew Tom was seeking...

00:33:02,179 --> 00:33:04,248
professional company
with that woman.

00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:06,116
For a while,

00:33:06,116 --> 00:33:08,018
it worked for both of us.

00:33:08,018 --> 00:33:09,286
And then...

00:33:09,286 --> 00:33:10,687
it didn't.

00:33:10,687 --> 00:33:12,189
That morning,

00:33:12,189 --> 00:33:13,390
we were supposed
to get coffee

00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:15,859
and talk about mending
what was broken.

00:33:15,859 --> 00:33:18,362
<i>I went looking for him</i>
<i>in the locker room.</i>

00:33:18,362 --> 00:33:19,763
<i>I heard the shower running.</i>

00:33:19,763 --> 00:33:21,265
<i>That's when I saw him.</i>

00:33:28,438 --> 00:33:30,207
Well, it's a good thing
you called the cops.

00:33:30,207 --> 00:33:31,742
Oh...

00:33:31,742 --> 00:33:32,943
wait a minute, sorry--

00:33:32,943 --> 00:33:34,444
my bad--you didn't.

00:33:34,444 --> 00:33:37,080
No, instead you made up a story
about being in Tahoe.

00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,415
I shouldn't have lied.
The thing is,

00:33:38,415 --> 00:33:40,884
I knew who did it.

00:33:40,884 --> 00:33:42,753
At least I thought I did.

00:33:42,753 --> 00:33:44,021
I couldn't bear the scandal.

00:33:44,021 --> 00:33:45,289
What are you talking about?

00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:47,090
Oxford was furious with Tom.

00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:48,926
They'd had a number
of confrontations.

00:33:48,926 --> 00:33:50,160
Over you?

00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,962
No, over his son Eli.

00:33:51,962 --> 00:33:54,998
He was trying to get him
on the team--Tom refused.

00:33:54,998 --> 00:33:56,700
Said some things
money couldn't buy.

00:33:57,768 --> 00:33:59,303
That's a good story.

00:33:59,303 --> 00:34:01,305
Especially since
Jack Oxford

00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:03,140
and your husband are both dead.

00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:05,142
Dead men tell no tales.

00:34:06,243 --> 00:34:08,111
I'm telling you the truth.

00:34:08,111 --> 00:34:10,781
And I'm telling you, you really
should call your lawyer now.

00:34:12,149 --> 00:34:13,951
HODGES:
Hey, boss!

00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:17,754
I heard that, uh, Mrs. Burns
just got booked.

00:34:17,754 --> 00:34:19,223
So I guess my travails
in high heels

00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:20,457
and crocodile tears
paid off?

00:34:20,457 --> 00:34:22,759
Yeah, the D.A.'s going forward

00:34:22,759 --> 00:34:24,795
but Mrs. Burns is
claiming that Oxford

00:34:24,795 --> 00:34:27,231
killed her husband,
and then someone shot Oxford

00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:28,465
using her gun.

00:34:28,465 --> 00:34:29,967
Sounds pretty thin.

00:34:29,967 --> 00:34:31,335
Except for the fact that...

00:34:31,335 --> 00:34:32,836
her gun was wiped clean.

00:34:32,836 --> 00:34:34,271
We still don't know
what was used

00:34:34,271 --> 00:34:36,440
to bludgeon the coach to death,
so, forensically,

00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,775
we can't place either weapon
in her hand.

00:34:38,775 --> 00:34:40,911
So it's back
to you--your...

00:34:40,911 --> 00:34:43,814
travails yield anything
on our mystery impressions?

00:34:43,814 --> 00:34:45,315
I'm still working on it.

00:34:45,315 --> 00:34:47,417
I have eliminated
all shoe possibilities

00:34:47,417 --> 00:34:49,920
and all other sundry
and slightly repulsive

00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,188
locker room possibilities.

00:34:51,188 --> 00:34:52,389
So, back to work.

00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:54,424
Oh, hey, um...

00:34:54,424 --> 00:34:56,026
for what it's worth,

00:34:56,026 --> 00:34:58,362
I knew Charlie had nothing
to do with this.

00:34:58,362 --> 00:35:00,063
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

00:35:01,164 --> 00:35:03,133
Okay...

00:35:07,838 --> 00:35:09,806
Hey.

00:35:09,806 --> 00:35:11,108
That was a good day.

00:35:11,108 --> 00:35:12,309
RUSSELL:
Proud day.

00:35:12,309 --> 00:35:14,311
First game as a starter.

00:35:16,914 --> 00:35:18,415
Rumors are all over campus.

00:35:18,415 --> 00:35:21,351
About Coach, his wife,
Jack Oxford.

00:35:21,351 --> 00:35:24,354
T.J. says the program's screwed.

00:35:24,354 --> 00:35:27,190
Some of the players are starting
to get calls from other schools.

00:35:29,726 --> 00:35:31,028
Are you getting calls?

00:35:31,028 --> 00:35:32,696
A couple.

00:35:32,696 --> 00:35:35,399
Okay.

00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:37,200
(sighs)

00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,368
What are you gonna do?

00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,171
What do you think I should do?

00:35:41,171 --> 00:35:43,373
Not the question.

00:35:43,373 --> 00:35:45,075
I know you're pissed off
at me, Dad.

00:35:46,877 --> 00:35:50,047
No. I'm not pissed, Charlie.
I'm--I'm...

00:35:50,047 --> 00:35:51,815
disappointed, that's all.

00:35:54,451 --> 00:35:57,988
(sighing): All right, I think
we need to talk about Vanessa.

00:35:57,988 --> 00:36:01,291
Why bother? She broke up
with me out of the blue.

00:36:01,291 --> 00:36:03,727
And said she got a job
at another school.

00:36:03,727 --> 00:36:05,429
One day,
we're madly in love,

00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:07,364
moving in together,
and the next day she's gone.

00:36:09,399 --> 00:36:12,169
What is it you always say?

00:36:12,169 --> 00:36:14,004
"Wisdom comes through struggle."

00:36:14,004 --> 00:36:15,772
(sighs)

00:36:15,772 --> 00:36:17,708
Well, that's easy to say.

00:36:19,443 --> 00:36:21,845
Think I'm gonna keep struggling
here in Vegas.

00:36:23,914 --> 00:36:25,749
Hell, if guys like T.J. leave,

00:36:25,749 --> 00:36:27,117
I should get
some playing time, right?

00:36:29,886 --> 00:36:31,421
More good days ahead.

00:36:31,421 --> 00:36:32,889
Dinner Sunday?

00:36:32,889 --> 00:36:34,825
Yeah, I'm in.

00:36:40,397 --> 00:36:42,332
Hmm.

00:36:42,332 --> 00:36:43,867
♪ ♪

00:37:11,361 --> 00:37:13,163
♪ ♪

00:37:31,448 --> 00:37:34,017
I think Russell's hunch
was right.

00:37:34,017 --> 00:37:35,719
Well, maybe right.

00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:37,187
Least he was in the...
ballpark.

00:37:38,388 --> 00:37:40,057
Come on, that was a good one.

00:37:40,057 --> 00:37:42,392
Based on the consistent
repeating pattern,

00:37:42,392 --> 00:37:44,361
the location
of the crime scene,

00:37:44,361 --> 00:37:47,764
I definitely think
our mystery object is a ball.

00:37:47,764 --> 00:37:48,965
Yes, but...
(sighs)

00:37:48,965 --> 00:37:50,267
it's not a basketball.

00:37:50,267 --> 00:37:52,202
Or at least not
one of these basketballs.

00:37:52,202 --> 00:37:54,404
They all created tiny,
dimpled patterns and...

00:37:54,404 --> 00:37:55,839
rolled or bounced

00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:57,674
in a reasonably straight line.

00:37:57,674 --> 00:37:59,676
Yeah, pattern at the scene
was smooth, no dimples,

00:37:59,676 --> 00:38:03,313
and the path was
jagged, irregular.

00:38:03,313 --> 00:38:04,948
You see something?

00:38:07,717 --> 00:38:08,952
Ugh.

00:38:08,952 --> 00:38:10,387
I hate me right now.

00:38:10,387 --> 00:38:12,389
What are you talking about?

00:38:12,389 --> 00:38:15,258
This detail in the impression...

00:38:15,258 --> 00:38:17,994
does it look like it could've
been caused...

00:38:17,994 --> 00:38:19,963
by a lace?
Yeah.

00:38:19,963 --> 00:38:21,164
Maybe.

00:38:21,164 --> 00:38:22,365
Why?

00:38:22,365 --> 00:38:23,834
(chuckles)

00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:26,069
A little roll down memory lane.

00:38:26,069 --> 00:38:27,404
Prior to 1948,

00:38:27,404 --> 00:38:29,706
all basketballs had laces.

00:38:29,706 --> 00:38:31,141
Not unlike this replica here.

00:38:31,141 --> 00:38:33,009
The laces were crude,
hand-stitched,

00:38:33,009 --> 00:38:35,745
and irregular shape--
didn't matter, because back then

00:38:35,745 --> 00:38:37,681
the goal was to pass,
not to dribble.

00:38:37,681 --> 00:38:39,182
Just roll the ball, please.

00:38:39,182 --> 00:38:42,119
A little historical
perspective never hurt.

00:38:52,696 --> 00:38:54,698
Wow. Well, it sure
looks like a match to me.

00:38:54,698 --> 00:38:56,833
Same general
characteristics, spacing...

00:38:56,833 --> 00:38:58,001
I agree.

00:38:58,001 --> 00:38:59,836
Okay, so, an antique basketball

00:38:59,836 --> 00:39:02,105
rolled through
Coach Burns' blood...

00:39:02,105 --> 00:39:03,306
How does that happen?

00:39:03,306 --> 00:39:04,908
Don't know.

00:39:04,908 --> 00:39:06,243
What we do know is...

00:39:06,243 --> 00:39:08,812
that antique basketballs...

00:39:08,812 --> 00:39:10,981
are often showcased on heavy,

00:39:10,981 --> 00:39:13,884
rectangular display cases
like this.

00:39:13,884 --> 00:39:15,986
Flat surfaces, sharp edges.

00:39:15,986 --> 00:39:18,388
Would explain the two types
of wound patterns

00:39:18,388 --> 00:39:20,690
that Doc found on
Coach Burns' face and head.

00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:21,958
I assume basketballs

00:39:21,958 --> 00:39:23,960
this old are rare.
Very.

00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,163
Can't be too many people
in Vegas who own one.

00:39:34,437 --> 00:39:36,907
The next time you bring
your basketball to a murder,

00:39:36,907 --> 00:39:38,141
you might want to...

00:39:38,141 --> 00:39:39,809
think about
getting rid of it.

00:39:39,809 --> 00:39:42,212
Even if it is
worth 85 grand.

00:39:42,212 --> 00:39:44,214
FINLAY:
Yeah, we swabbed the ball
and the display stand

00:39:44,214 --> 00:39:45,415
that we found
in your office,

00:39:45,415 --> 00:39:47,184
and it came back positive

00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:49,819
for Coach Burns' blood.

00:39:49,819 --> 00:39:53,123
Burns was a stubborn
son of a bitch.

00:39:53,123 --> 00:39:56,960
I asked him for one thing:

00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,262
Put Jack Oxford's kid
on the team.

00:39:59,262 --> 00:40:01,698
I'm trying to take
a damn shower here.

00:40:01,698 --> 00:40:03,767
Just put him on the team, Tom.

00:40:03,767 --> 00:40:06,269
Please. Who cares if he can't
play? Let him ride the bench.

00:40:06,269 --> 00:40:07,771
Nobody tells me who to recruit.

00:40:07,771 --> 00:40:09,206
I need this, Tom.

00:40:09,206 --> 00:40:10,674
Oxford's our biggest donor.

00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:12,776
I'll never ask again.
I promise.

00:40:15,078 --> 00:40:18,815
This is one of the first
basketballs ever made--1894.

00:40:18,815 --> 00:40:21,451
Signed by James Naismith.

00:40:21,451 --> 00:40:24,454
I want you
to have it.
You're pathetic, you know that?

00:40:24,454 --> 00:40:26,223
Who the hell
do you think you are?

00:40:26,223 --> 00:40:27,457
You work for me.

00:40:27,457 --> 00:40:29,059
I'm the face of this university.

00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:30,260
This brand.

00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:32,429
Not you.
You're just some...

00:40:32,429 --> 00:40:34,764
Ivy League pimp
with his hand out,

00:40:34,764 --> 00:40:35,899
looking for cash.

00:40:37,334 --> 00:40:38,435
Now, you get the
hell out here.

00:40:41,204 --> 00:40:43,406
AUSTIN: <i>Oxford gave millions</i>
<i>to WLVU.</i>

00:40:45,375 --> 00:40:48,044
Coach Burns got the glory,
but I did all the hard work.

00:40:48,044 --> 00:40:50,113
FINLAY:
Sucking up to donors,

00:40:50,113 --> 00:40:52,282
and always having
to make them happy.

00:40:52,282 --> 00:40:54,417
And when they're not,
they pull their cash.

00:40:54,417 --> 00:40:55,885
Then it's my fault.

00:40:55,885 --> 00:40:57,287
My ass on the line.

00:40:59,055 --> 00:41:00,357
But Burns couldn't care less.

00:41:01,458 --> 00:41:03,393
(grunting, squishing)

00:41:10,934 --> 00:41:12,335
(grunts)

00:41:16,106 --> 00:41:18,742
And as I was leaving,
I saw Linda driving up.

00:41:20,977 --> 00:41:24,714
And I knew she was having
an affair with Oxford.

00:41:24,714 --> 00:41:27,150
I knew she had a gun,
and I needed a way out.

00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:28,451
And you probably
hated Jack,

00:41:28,451 --> 00:41:30,320
so killing him and
setting up the wife,

00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,988
that's a two-fer, right?

00:41:31,988 --> 00:41:34,090
So you snuck into
Coach Burns' house,

00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:37,927
you stole his gun and then
you shot the biggest booster

00:41:37,927 --> 00:41:40,797
in WLVU's history.

00:41:40,797 --> 00:41:42,766
That's irony.

00:41:42,766 --> 00:41:44,701
At least I think
that's the way

00:41:44,701 --> 00:41:47,103
these academic guys put it.

00:41:47,103 --> 00:41:52,309
For 20 years, I've given
that school everything.

00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:55,779
Given it...my life.

00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:57,380
And now with a
double-homicide,

00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:00,950
that very same life will belong
to the state penitentiary.

00:42:05,055 --> 00:42:07,691
So, did the girl
love Charlie?

00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:10,727
I think Charlie
believed that, yeah.

00:42:10,727 --> 00:42:12,395
We're going to have to tell him.

00:42:12,395 --> 00:42:13,863
I know. I know.

00:42:15,265 --> 00:42:18,301
Why didn't you tell me?

00:42:18,301 --> 00:42:20,670
There are things that
I don't talk to you about.

00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:22,138
The things
that I don't...

00:42:22,138 --> 00:42:24,441
I don't bring home,
but that was...

00:42:24,441 --> 00:42:26,376
that was our deal, right?

00:42:28,812 --> 00:42:31,414
Charlie is our son.

00:42:31,414 --> 00:42:35,018
You owe it to me to tell me
if he's in trouble.

00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:38,755
You're right.

00:42:38,755 --> 00:42:41,291
You need to tell me, anyway.

00:42:41,291 --> 00:42:44,094
You sure you want that?

00:42:44,094 --> 00:42:46,463
Given the nature of
what I see every day?

00:42:46,463 --> 00:42:49,899
You need to talk to me about it.

00:42:49,899 --> 00:42:52,001
You think you're protecting me,

00:42:52,001 --> 00:42:54,204
but you're just trying
to protect yourself.

00:42:54,204 --> 00:42:56,306
And that's when
we get into trouble.

00:42:56,306 --> 00:42:58,908
Promise me, no more secrets.

00:43:01,211 --> 00:43:03,113
I know who I
married, D.B.

00:43:05,081 --> 00:43:07,751
I know who I married too.
