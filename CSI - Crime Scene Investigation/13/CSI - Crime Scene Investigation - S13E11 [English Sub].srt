00:00:12,655 --> 00:00:13,856
PRODUCER:
Ready 11.

00:00:13,856 --> 00:00:15,624
DIRECTOR:
25 seconds to air.

00:00:15,624 --> 00:00:18,027
PRODUCER: T.O.C., we should
have Ella up on the strip.

00:00:18,027 --> 00:00:19,928
Signal looks good.
20 seconds.

00:00:19,928 --> 00:00:21,797
Tell Rainy that we're gonna
stick with Theresa

00:00:21,797 --> 00:00:23,298
for the first segment,
so no Storm Center

00:00:23,298 --> 00:00:24,700
till after the bump.

00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,101
(crew chattering)

00:00:26,101 --> 00:00:28,070
Ten seconds to air.
Put Denny on standby

00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,605
to warm up her green
screen lights.

00:00:29,605 --> 00:00:30,906
Okay.

00:00:30,906 --> 00:00:32,741
Five seconds.
Why don't I see Theresa?

00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:34,510
Because "my boy Friday"
doesn't understand

00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:37,179
the difference
between lipstick and lip liner.

00:00:37,179 --> 00:00:39,848
ANNOUNCER:
Tonight, on KVKC News
DIRECTOR: We're live.

00:00:39,848 --> 00:00:41,050
with Theresa Shea...

00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:42,785
Ready one.
That's not fair.

00:00:42,785 --> 00:00:44,153
You specifically said
you wanted...

00:00:44,153 --> 00:00:45,888
PRODUCER:
Chad, get Theresa some coffee.

00:00:45,888 --> 00:00:47,690
(snaps fingers)
Light cream.

00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:48,991
Truvia, specifically.

00:00:48,991 --> 00:00:51,593
Chad, now.

00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:54,096
Move two to apple six.

00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:55,798
ANNOUNCER:
...Las Vegas.

00:00:55,798 --> 00:00:57,132
go one.

00:00:57,132 --> 00:00:59,601
Welcome to
the KVKC Local News at 11:00.

00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:01,136
I'm Theresa Shea.

00:01:01,136 --> 00:01:03,305
Our top story is a torrential
rain hitting the city.

00:01:03,305 --> 00:01:04,707
Ready two.

00:01:04,707 --> 00:01:05,908
Open up Ella, REM 17.

00:01:05,908 --> 00:01:07,109
On the scene

00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:08,310
in the eye of the storm

00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,878
is our own fearless
Ella St. James.

00:01:09,878 --> 00:01:11,647
Go REM 17.

00:01:11,647 --> 00:01:13,248
THERESA:
Ella, how's it look out there?

00:01:13,248 --> 00:01:15,951
Uh, Theresa,
I'm having trouble hearing you,

00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:17,953
so let me just report
what I know.

00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:20,556
The storm has picked up
and is getting worse,
Come on, come on.

00:01:20,556 --> 00:01:21,990
(static crackling):
with wind speeds increasing

00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,192
up to 80 miles per hour.

00:01:23,192 --> 00:01:24,593
THERESA:
Ella?

00:01:24,593 --> 00:01:25,794
Can't hear you, so if you...

00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:27,830
Theresa, pull it back.
Go three.

00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:30,599
Thanks, Ella.

00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:32,568
We'll try to get
that sound sorted out.

00:01:32,568 --> 00:01:33,769
We'd like to remind everyone

00:01:33,769 --> 00:01:35,604
that it's best to stay indoors

00:01:35,604 --> 00:01:36,872
for the next few hours.

00:01:36,872 --> 00:01:38,540
(crew murmuring)

00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:39,742
(scoffs)

00:01:39,742 --> 00:01:41,210
It's like amateur hour tonight.

00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,178
Theresa, just bear
with us a second.

00:01:43,178 --> 00:01:44,980
Can someone tell me
what the hell is going on?

00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,815
House lights are out,
overheads as well.

00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:49,084
No monitors,
camera servers are down.

00:01:49,084 --> 00:01:50,652
We're blacked out.

00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:52,287
Denny, tell me you're
on it, brother.

00:01:52,287 --> 00:01:54,656
I am. Hopefully the generator
out back will kick in soon.

00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:55,924
(crew chattering)

00:01:55,924 --> 00:01:59,728
Theresa, you still
okay in there?

00:01:59,728 --> 00:02:01,130
Theresa, you still there?

00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,034
MAN:
I think we're back.

00:02:06,034 --> 00:02:07,870
Theresa, you okay?

00:02:09,705 --> 00:02:12,040
(crew gasping)

00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,176
Go to a commercial.
Go to a commercial!

00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:16,145
(crew chattering)

00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:22,184
RUSSELL:
Looks a lot bigger on TV.

00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:25,087
This your newscast
of choice?

00:02:25,087 --> 00:02:26,889
I like watching them all.

00:02:26,889 --> 00:02:29,024
Like a little mini documentary
on the city every night.

00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:30,225
Hey.

00:02:30,225 --> 00:02:31,693
Detective Vartann,

00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:33,095
what's our top story tonight?

00:02:33,095 --> 00:02:35,998
Theresa Shea,
the most trusted name in news.

00:02:35,998 --> 00:02:37,766
Alive when the power went out.

00:02:37,766 --> 00:02:39,301
20 seconds later,
the lights come back on,

00:02:39,301 --> 00:02:41,770
and she falls dead
onto the news desk.

00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:43,739
Well, somebody in here
must have seen something.

00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:45,207
Sound person, camera guy?

00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:46,675
Cameramen don't exist anymore.

00:02:46,675 --> 00:02:47,876
Cameras are all robots,

00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,111
operated from the
control rooms.

00:02:49,111 --> 00:02:50,646
Sound and
lighting, too.

00:02:50,646 --> 00:02:52,781
Newsrooms have gone
the way of gas stations.

00:02:52,781 --> 00:02:55,117
Great, got a locked
room mystery,

00:02:55,117 --> 00:02:56,518
with a million viewers.

00:02:56,518 --> 00:02:59,521
VARTANN:
Come on over here.

00:02:59,521 --> 00:03:01,623
This is Denny Jones; he's
the studio lighting tech.

00:03:01,623 --> 00:03:03,826
I didn't know if you wanted
the house lights up or not.

00:03:03,826 --> 00:03:06,228
Denny, can you get the lights
back to these exact settings?

00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:07,629
Push of a button.

00:03:07,629 --> 00:03:08,897
Turn up the sun.

00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,666
Let's go.

00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:12,201
What's the rest of
the team doing tonight?

00:03:12,201 --> 00:03:14,803
Finn is finishing
a fire investigation.

00:03:14,803 --> 00:03:16,672
Life coach
or something like that.

00:03:16,672 --> 00:03:18,240
Walking on coals gone
horribly wrong?

00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,641
Probably.

00:03:19,641 --> 00:03:21,043
Greg and Morgan

00:03:21,043 --> 00:03:23,245
are pushing paper,
and Nick's on a B and E.

00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:25,247
(lights clank)

00:03:31,653 --> 00:03:35,624
Okay, call him and tell him
to lock in chain of custody.

00:03:35,624 --> 00:03:37,559
I want all
hands on deck.

00:03:37,559 --> 00:03:40,562
Crime lab has the same rule
as the local news:

00:03:40,562 --> 00:03:43,765
if it bleeds,
it leads.

00:03:50,572 --> 00:03:53,242
♪ Who... are you? ♪

00:03:53,242 --> 00:03:56,211
♪ Who, who, who, who? ♪

00:03:56,211 --> 00:03:59,681

00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:14,196

00:04:20,869 --> 00:04:23,705
Looks like there's only
the one injury.

00:04:23,705 --> 00:04:25,841
Single puncture wound
to the back of the neck.

00:04:25,841 --> 00:04:27,276
The shape suggests a knife.

00:04:27,276 --> 00:04:29,011
Killer was either lucky
or good.

00:04:29,011 --> 00:04:31,113
He hit the perfect spot
to kill her.

00:04:31,113 --> 00:04:33,749
When we dissected frogs
in high school biology,

00:04:33,749 --> 00:04:36,251
you'd pith it
by sticking a pin

00:04:36,251 --> 00:04:38,186
right here.

00:04:38,186 --> 00:04:40,055
The frog would get all...

00:04:40,055 --> 00:04:41,723
None of the
girls in class

00:04:41,723 --> 00:04:43,625
wanted to do it, so
they asked me to.

00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:44,826
I became known

00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:46,595
as the designated pither.

00:04:46,595 --> 00:04:48,597
I would have gone
with relief pither.

00:04:48,597 --> 00:04:50,532
That's better.

00:04:50,532 --> 00:04:52,834
David, can you, um,
sit her up for me one more time?

00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,803
I want to get some context.
Yeah.

00:04:57,272 --> 00:05:00,008
(grunts)

00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,278
Spatter

00:05:03,278 --> 00:05:06,548
suggests the killer came
from the left.

00:05:06,548 --> 00:05:08,817
<i>Plunged the knife in the back</i>
<i>of her neck.</i>

00:05:10,152 --> 00:05:12,754
Directional blood drops
tell me

00:05:12,754 --> 00:05:15,290
he took off to the right
in a hurry.

00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:19,695
If this was a pithing,
this was a drive-by pithing.

00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:29,171
I know where I'm watching
the next Seahawks game.

00:05:29,171 --> 00:05:31,106
VARTANN:
CSI Russell?
Yeah?

00:05:31,106 --> 00:05:33,208
Fred Paulsen,
executive producer.

00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,077
Hey.
Hey, how are you?

00:05:35,077 --> 00:05:36,812
22 years of covering crime,

00:05:36,812 --> 00:05:38,914
I never figured it would hit
this close to home.

00:05:38,914 --> 00:05:40,949
Can you give us a sense
of what happened?

00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:42,918
Um, we were cutting back
from our field reporter,

00:05:42,918 --> 00:05:44,119
and the lights went out.

00:05:44,119 --> 00:05:45,520
You mean the power.

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,055
No, the power here
is compartmentalized.

00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:49,024
There's battery backup
for all the electronics.

00:05:49,024 --> 00:05:51,126
The lights reroute
through a generator out back.

00:05:51,126 --> 00:05:52,728
And it took 20 seconds

00:05:52,728 --> 00:05:54,796
for the backup generator
to kick in, right?

00:05:54,796 --> 00:05:56,832
During which time,
we were all in the dark.

00:05:56,832 --> 00:05:58,166
No light means no eyewitnesses.

00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:00,102
Makes a murder case
a little tougher to crack.

00:06:00,102 --> 00:06:02,204
Right, but every murder
needs three things, right?

00:06:02,204 --> 00:06:04,539
Means, motive, opportunity.

00:06:04,539 --> 00:06:06,074
We have a low threshold
on means.

00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,809
Victim sustained
a sharp-force injury.

00:06:07,809 --> 00:06:09,644
Anyone can get their hands
on something sharp.

00:06:09,644 --> 00:06:11,780
Okay, let's talk
about motive.

00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:14,750
You have any idea who would
want to see Theresa Shea dead?

00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,551
Sure.

00:06:18,053 --> 00:06:19,254
You could start
right there.

00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:20,689
What's this?

00:06:20,689 --> 00:06:21,890
Our crew list.

00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:23,091
Theresa was not

00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:24,693
the easiest person to work with.

00:06:24,693 --> 00:06:26,828
Well, that leaves
opportunity.

00:06:26,828 --> 00:06:28,964
Which would narrow down
this list.

00:06:28,964 --> 00:06:32,167
So, lights were out
for 20 seconds, right?

00:06:32,167 --> 00:06:33,568
Who would have been close enough

00:06:33,568 --> 00:06:35,937
to kill her
in that window of time?

00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:39,908
Plausibly, three of my people
would've been in that vicinity.

00:06:39,908 --> 00:06:43,678
Okay, well, I've
got three people.

00:06:43,678 --> 00:06:46,014
Let's go
with man-to-man coverage.

00:06:49,217 --> 00:06:51,853
Paulsen told me they wouldn't
need me until the next segment,

00:06:51,853 --> 00:06:54,022
so I stayed here,
monitoring the Doppler.

00:06:54,022 --> 00:06:55,223
For the monsoon?

00:06:55,223 --> 00:06:56,625
Monsoons only happen

00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:57,826
between May and August.

00:06:57,826 --> 00:06:59,194
Technically,
this was a training.

00:06:59,194 --> 00:07:00,695
A training?

00:07:00,695 --> 00:07:02,130
Two storms hitting
at the same time,

00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,999
upping the volume
of precipitation,

00:07:03,999 --> 00:07:06,034
creating a flash flood.

00:07:06,034 --> 00:07:07,803
That's very impressive.

00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:11,006
Masters in meteorology
and atmospheric sciences,

00:07:11,006 --> 00:07:13,542
and I've got the student loans
to prove it.

00:07:13,542 --> 00:07:14,810
Rainy, do they
make you wear that?

00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,179
I mean,
wouldn't you want to dress

00:07:17,179 --> 00:07:19,181
a little bit
more conservatively?

00:07:19,181 --> 00:07:21,950
Well, if I did, I'd be at home
watching the girl who didn't.

00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:24,086
And my real
name's not Rainy.

00:07:24,086 --> 00:07:26,588
It's a cutthroat business.

00:07:26,588 --> 00:07:28,290
Well, any idea
who may have wanted

00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:30,192
to cut Theresa's throat?

00:07:30,192 --> 00:07:31,726
Or neck?

00:07:31,726 --> 00:07:33,261
Top of my list
would be Ella.

00:07:33,261 --> 00:07:34,663
Ella.
Mm-hmm.

00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:37,265
Is she the
field reporter?

00:07:37,265 --> 00:07:41,103
Well, Paulsen was grooming Ella
to take over the anchor desk.

00:07:41,103 --> 00:07:43,271
But the most trusted bitch
in news was not going

00:07:43,271 --> 00:07:45,207
to go quietly into that night.

00:07:45,207 --> 00:07:46,875
So Ella had the
most to gain

00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:48,610
if Theresa was
out of the way.

00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:50,612
Where was she
at the time of the murder?

00:07:50,612 --> 00:07:52,981
Giving a report
clear across town.

00:07:52,981 --> 00:07:54,983
Well, that's
a pretty good alibi.

00:07:54,983 --> 00:07:57,886
But in all honesty,
it could be anyone.

00:07:57,886 --> 00:08:00,589
Theresa could be brutal.

00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,558
MAKEUP ARTIST:
<i>So she's really dead?</i>

00:08:03,558 --> 00:08:04,960
Did you get her broomstick
as proof?

00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,262
You don't seem very
broken up about it.

00:08:07,262 --> 00:08:09,131
That woman made
everyone's life a living hell,

00:08:09,131 --> 00:08:10,999
but my life
was her favorite target.

00:08:10,999 --> 00:08:13,768
So, Chad, where were you
when the lights went out?

00:08:13,768 --> 00:08:16,705
I was getting her her coffee,
light cream, Truvia.

00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:19,040
I was at the vending machine,
right there.

00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,009
How'd you pay for it?

00:08:21,009 --> 00:08:22,511
Credit card.

00:08:22,511 --> 00:08:23,745
Why?

00:08:23,745 --> 00:08:25,280
Might have a
time-date stamp.

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,582
I'll need the
number to verify.

00:08:27,582 --> 00:08:29,017
I'd also like
to check out

00:08:29,017 --> 00:08:31,186
the sharp objects
that you carry around for work.

00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,191
Take your pick.

00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,162
BRODY:
You've got a lot

00:08:40,162 --> 00:08:42,931
of sharp tools here,
Denny.

00:08:42,931 --> 00:08:45,800
My job involves a fair
amount of cutting.

00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,036
Wire, cable, carpet, tape.

00:08:48,036 --> 00:08:50,705
Each requires a
different blade.

00:08:50,705 --> 00:08:53,575
I'm gonna need to take
a swab of your hands.

00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:54,809
What does a swab do?

00:08:54,809 --> 00:08:57,045
We use it to find blood.

00:09:02,551 --> 00:09:04,219
You think I might
have stabbed Theresa.

00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,291
You're on the list.

00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:11,660
I guess that makes sense.

00:09:19,701 --> 00:09:21,870
No blood.

00:09:23,905 --> 00:09:25,974
So...

00:09:25,974 --> 00:09:29,277
if you were to stab somebody,

00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,946
what would you use?

00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,954
Nothing here.

00:09:38,954 --> 00:09:41,089
Something with a heftier handle
so that you can...

00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:46,928
Sorry, I didn't mean to...

00:09:46,928 --> 00:09:49,731
What do you do here, Denny?

00:09:49,731 --> 00:09:51,733
Lighting, simple I.T. work,

00:09:51,733 --> 00:09:54,536
and, um...

00:09:54,536 --> 00:09:56,271
Listen, you gonna need
anything else from me?

00:09:56,271 --> 00:09:58,940
No, I'm good.

00:10:01,876 --> 00:10:04,112
Thank you.

00:10:04,112 --> 00:10:05,714
Theresa.

00:10:05,714 --> 00:10:07,849
Was she in pain

00:10:07,849 --> 00:10:10,785
when it happened, when...
when the knife went in?

00:10:10,785 --> 00:10:13,722
I don't know.

00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,302
(thunder rumbling)

00:10:44,219 --> 00:10:46,221
(sniffs)

00:11:01,903 --> 00:11:06,174
Hey, uh, I think some of the
power's still out there, bud.

00:11:06,174 --> 00:11:07,909
No, only in
the main circuit.

00:11:07,909 --> 00:11:09,511
Garage runs on a feed

00:11:09,511 --> 00:11:11,146
that's divorced from
the rest of the station.

00:11:11,146 --> 00:11:14,983
Say, you sure do seem
to know a lot about

00:11:14,983 --> 00:11:17,052
the electrical workings
of the building.

00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:18,286
What's your name?

00:11:18,286 --> 00:11:22,057
Robbie. It's kind
of my job to.

00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:23,591
Uh, who are you?

00:11:23,591 --> 00:11:25,760
I'm Nick Stokes
with the crime lab.

00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,596
Hi. Um, is it true
about Theresa?

00:11:28,596 --> 00:11:29,798
Murder?

00:11:29,798 --> 00:11:31,800
Yes, ma'am, it is.
We drove back

00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,168
as soon as we heard
what happened.

00:11:33,168 --> 00:11:34,903
News vans from
our competition are

00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:37,639
already gathered in front
of the station. Vultures.

00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:39,808
And how well
did you two know Ms. Shea?

00:11:39,808 --> 00:11:42,577
I'm not sure anyone
really knew her.

00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:44,045
She kept the world
at arm's length.

00:11:44,045 --> 00:11:45,847
Saw everyone
as a threat.

00:11:45,847 --> 00:11:47,849
Would you mind giving us
a quick interview

00:11:47,849 --> 00:11:49,718
about this investigation?
If you could do that

00:11:49,718 --> 00:11:51,786
"yes, ma'am" thing again,
that would be great.

00:11:51,786 --> 00:11:53,288
Robbie, could you get out
the camera...

00:11:53,288 --> 00:11:56,558
No. Actually, I would mind.
Sorry.

00:11:56,558 --> 00:12:00,795
I know it seems callous,
but it is my job.

00:12:00,795 --> 00:12:04,299
Well, it is my job to process
the crime scene... ma'am.

00:12:04,299 --> 00:12:06,067
But if we need
anything else,

00:12:06,067 --> 00:12:08,703
we'll be sure to be
in touch, okay?

00:12:08,703 --> 00:12:11,306
Okay.
Right.

00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:22,117
(phone ringing)

00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:30,525
(phone beeps)

00:12:34,262 --> 00:12:36,197
Cheek implants?

00:12:36,197 --> 00:12:39,868
This poor woman was fighting
the war against aging

00:12:39,868 --> 00:12:42,570
one cosmetic procedure
at a time.

00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:45,140
Scarring and thread
from multiple facelifts.

00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,708
Forehead presents

00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:49,277
immobile musculature
suggesting Botox.

00:12:49,277 --> 00:12:51,679
Lip and wrinkle fillers,
you name it.

00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:53,681
When your looks are
married to your career,

00:12:53,681 --> 00:12:54,883
it's job security,
I suppose.

00:12:54,883 --> 00:12:56,084
(chuckles softly)

00:12:56,084 --> 00:12:57,986
C.O.D.?

00:12:57,986 --> 00:12:59,220
Severed brain stem.

00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,623
Knife wound hit right between

00:13:01,623 --> 00:13:04,125
the occipital bone of
the skull and atlas, C1.

00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,995
<i>Spinal cord was transected</i>
<i>at the level</i>

00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:10,098
<i>of the medulla oblongata,</i>
<i>effectively disconnecting</i>

00:13:10,098 --> 00:13:13,134
<i>the transmission of signals</i>
<i>between the brain and the body.</i>

00:13:13,134 --> 00:13:15,069
So not just
lucky, good.

00:13:15,069 --> 00:13:17,138
Yeah.

00:13:17,138 --> 00:13:18,907
Any idea of the
murder weapon?

00:13:18,907 --> 00:13:22,744
We did find bruising at
the entrance of the wound.

00:13:22,744 --> 00:13:25,613
You know, it kind of looks
like one of those guards

00:13:25,613 --> 00:13:27,081
that you see on
folding utility knives.

00:13:27,081 --> 00:13:28,283
It's a single-edged blade

00:13:28,283 --> 00:13:29,684
and a sharp one at that.

00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:30,885
Some sort of

00:13:30,885 --> 00:13:32,554
viscous green paste
in the wound track?

00:13:32,554 --> 00:13:33,755
Any idea what that is?

00:13:33,755 --> 00:13:36,124
Well, it is not biological.

00:13:36,124 --> 00:13:39,594
Looks like a job
for David Hodges.

00:13:39,594 --> 00:13:41,162
(phone ringing)

00:13:46,734 --> 00:13:48,236
Hello, Russell.

00:13:48,236 --> 00:13:50,772
Hey. I've been following
the dedicated power line

00:13:50,772 --> 00:13:54,142
that goes between
Nevada Flats Power and KVKC,

00:13:54,142 --> 00:13:56,778
trying to figure out
why the power went out.

00:13:56,778 --> 00:13:59,514
Oh. You finding anything
interesting?

00:13:59,514 --> 00:14:01,983
It's more about
what I didn't find.

00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:03,885
Transformer about a quarter mile

00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:05,920
from the station got blown
to bits.

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,689
Well, those transformers
can be volatile,

00:14:07,689 --> 00:14:09,023
particularly in wet weather.

00:14:09,023 --> 00:14:10,792
Maybe it was some sort
of a malfunction.

00:14:10,792 --> 00:14:12,861
Yeah, well, that's what
I thought at first, too,

00:14:12,861 --> 00:14:14,162
but then I found remains

00:14:14,162 --> 00:14:16,564
of explosive material
in the debris.

00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:18,533
Hold on a second, will ya?

00:14:29,143 --> 00:14:31,779
Oh, yeah, I just found
parts of a cell phone.

00:14:31,779 --> 00:14:33,281
This is definitely
not an accident.

00:14:33,281 --> 00:14:35,149
So this murder wasn't
a crime of opportunity.

00:14:35,149 --> 00:14:36,618
No, no, no.

00:14:36,618 --> 00:14:40,522
This was patient.
This was planned.

00:14:50,231 --> 00:14:52,967
What kind of device
are we looking at?

00:14:52,967 --> 00:14:56,538
Well, I got some nitroglycerine
and some wax paper.

00:14:56,538 --> 00:14:59,107
Figuring the former
was wrapped in the latter.

00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:00,909
You got to know an awful lot
about explosives

00:15:00,909 --> 00:15:02,110
to mess with dynamite.

00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,578
So we're looking for someone in

00:15:03,578 --> 00:15:06,548
construction, demolition,
ex-military.

00:15:06,548 --> 00:15:07,949
Cell phone.

00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:11,019
Cheap-looking components.
Could be a burner.

00:15:11,019 --> 00:15:12,220
Remote detonator?

00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,556
Welcome to the hurt locker.

00:15:14,556 --> 00:15:17,058
As long as the phone
has enough juice,

00:15:17,058 --> 00:15:19,894
<i>the device can sit and wait.</i>

00:15:19,894 --> 00:15:21,696
SIDLE: <i>Until it gets</i>
<i>a call to action.</i>

00:15:21,696 --> 00:15:22,931
(phone rings)

00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,670
Well, why don't
I take the phone.

00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,271
Maybe I'll get lucky

00:15:30,271 --> 00:15:31,940
and be able
to pull a print or two.

00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:35,009
I'll see if I can salvage
some date/shift code

00:15:35,009 --> 00:15:37,845
from the remnants of
the dynamite paper.

00:15:37,845 --> 00:15:40,114
♪ ♪

00:15:59,734 --> 00:16:01,736
♪ ♪

00:16:08,076 --> 00:16:10,011
(chuckles softly)

00:16:14,215 --> 00:16:16,851
Hey, Hodges, got anything
on the coffee cup

00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:18,620
Nick found
in the garage?
I do.

00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,755
Aside from a bold
French roast,

00:16:20,755 --> 00:16:23,091
I found trace of
water, salt and urea.

00:16:23,091 --> 00:16:25,760
Someone peed in
Theresa's cup?

00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,528
Or they're test-marketing

00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:28,896
a horrible new
nondairy sweetener.

00:16:28,896 --> 00:16:30,798
I think I know
who's behind this.

00:16:30,798 --> 00:16:32,934
Theresa's assistant Chad.

00:16:32,934 --> 00:16:34,636
I thought he might have

00:16:34,636 --> 00:16:37,205
hated her enough to kill her,
but I guess he had

00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:38,840
a smaller-scale
revenge plan in mind.

00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,041
Still. Ew.

00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,242
What about the green paste

00:16:41,242 --> 00:16:43,111
Sara found in
the victim's wound?

00:16:43,111 --> 00:16:44,612
Ah. Chromium oxide.

00:16:44,612 --> 00:16:46,114
Used to sharpen
knives and razors

00:16:46,114 --> 00:16:48,149
on pieces of leather.

00:16:48,149 --> 00:16:50,151
The piece of leather

00:16:50,151 --> 00:16:51,853
is called a "strop."

00:16:51,853 --> 00:16:53,921
And the method of sharpening
is called "stropping."

00:16:53,921 --> 00:16:57,025
You'd take a razor with
an imperfect edge,

00:16:57,025 --> 00:16:58,226
and begin stropping.

00:17:00,628 --> 00:17:03,264
The leather hugs the blade's
edge as the grit from

00:17:03,264 --> 00:17:06,601
the chromium oxide tears away
any imperfections and burrs,

00:17:06,601 --> 00:17:09,137
leaving our slasher
of Seville with

00:17:09,137 --> 00:17:10,805
a sharper-than-
sharp blade.

00:17:10,805 --> 00:17:14,542
Something Theresa Shea knew
all too well.

00:17:14,542 --> 00:17:15,977
I'm sorry to bother
you with this.

00:17:15,977 --> 00:17:17,679
FINLAY:
Oh, it's no bother.

00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:19,881
You said that it might be
important to our investigation.

00:17:19,881 --> 00:17:22,116
And it might be nothing, but I
wanted to make sure you saw it.

00:17:23,651 --> 00:17:25,553
Should be good to go.
Thank you.

00:17:27,121 --> 00:17:29,691
This is tape of the newscast

00:17:29,691 --> 00:17:30,925
from right before
the murder.

00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:32,694
Ella was giving
her remote report

00:17:32,694 --> 00:17:34,529
just after
11:00 p.m. Pacific.

00:17:34,529 --> 00:17:35,930
And this is our Doppler radar

00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,632
from the same time.

00:17:37,632 --> 00:17:39,233
Two storm fronts crashing
into one another.

00:17:39,233 --> 00:17:41,002
A training.
Mm-hmm.

00:17:41,002 --> 00:17:42,570
Our satellite shows

00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:44,906
two dense storms covering
the sky comprehensively.

00:17:44,906 --> 00:17:46,808
No light breaking
through anywhere.

00:17:46,808 --> 00:17:49,243
But if you look behind Ella
in the shot...

00:17:49,243 --> 00:17:50,878
You can see the moon.

00:17:50,878 --> 00:17:52,280
Which wouldn't
be possible

00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,816
if the clouds were as dense
as your Doppler suggests

00:17:54,816 --> 00:17:56,050
at the time
of broadcast.

00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:57,251
Exactly.

00:17:57,251 --> 00:17:58,686
I think this tape
was made before

00:17:58,686 --> 00:18:00,288
the two fronts trained into one.

00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:02,890
So you're saying Ella wasn't
broadcasting live?

00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:05,193
But she was having
a conversation with Theresa.

00:18:05,193 --> 00:18:06,761
No, she didn't,
remember?

00:18:06,761 --> 00:18:08,763
Rainy, can you play the tape?
Mm-hmm.

00:18:08,763 --> 00:18:11,199
Uh, Theresa, I'm having trouble
hearing you,

00:18:11,199 --> 00:18:13,101
so let me just report
what I know.

00:18:13,101 --> 00:18:16,270
How long before the murder
do you think this was recorded?

00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:17,672
Ballpark?

00:18:17,672 --> 00:18:19,774
Maybe a couple of hours.

00:18:19,774 --> 00:18:21,008
Is there any way
to confirm this?

00:18:21,008 --> 00:18:22,577
I don't know of any.

00:18:22,577 --> 00:18:25,113
I know who we
can talk to.

00:18:29,684 --> 00:18:31,719
(footsteps approaching)

00:18:31,719 --> 00:18:33,054
Hi, Denny.

00:18:33,054 --> 00:18:34,989
Uh, hope I'm not
interrupting.

00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:36,858
I have a technical
question.

00:18:36,858 --> 00:18:40,595
Well, you've come
to the right place.

00:18:40,595 --> 00:18:42,530
Okay.

00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:45,800
So, is it possible
to prerecord

00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,569
a report in one of
your remote vans,

00:18:48,569 --> 00:18:51,105
and then send it to newsroom
as if it were live?

00:18:51,105 --> 00:18:52,874
I suppose so.

00:18:52,874 --> 00:18:55,943
You'd have to fool the internal
clocks on the van side.

00:18:55,943 --> 00:18:57,111
And what about
on this end?

00:18:57,111 --> 00:18:58,813
Is there any
way of telling

00:18:58,813 --> 00:19:02,283
if a van is not where
a reporter might say it is?

00:19:02,283 --> 00:19:03,885
Yes.

00:19:03,885 --> 00:19:05,753
Yes, there is.

00:19:07,755 --> 00:19:09,223
Here, ma'am.

00:19:09,223 --> 00:19:10,892
(chuckles softly)

00:19:18,733 --> 00:19:21,302
This is from
last night.

00:19:21,302 --> 00:19:22,770
What am I looking at?
Oh, T.O.C.

00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:24,839
Transmission Operations Control.

00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:26,174
It's like an air
traffic controller

00:19:26,174 --> 00:19:27,575
for all our
microwave signals.

00:19:27,575 --> 00:19:29,744
And how many signals
do you have?

00:19:29,744 --> 00:19:30,978
Four remote vans

00:19:30,978 --> 00:19:33,281
times 11 towers
all over Clark county.

00:19:33,281 --> 00:19:35,883
A lot of signal
permutations.

00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:39,120
Wow, I had no idea
how complex this all was.

00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,889
FCC rules are a bitch.

00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:45,293
The guy in the van finds
the strongest signal path

00:19:45,293 --> 00:19:47,762
<i>and beams the microwaves</i>
<i>to the signal tower</i>

00:19:47,762 --> 00:19:50,665
<i>where it is amplified</i>
<i>and rerouted back here</i>

00:19:50,665 --> 00:19:52,133
<i>to our broadcast center.</i>

00:19:52,133 --> 00:19:54,168
<i>And when the signal comes back,</i>

00:19:54,168 --> 00:19:55,903
it lets us know
where it's been.

00:19:55,903 --> 00:20:00,541
So when Theresa was killed,
were Ella and her cameraman

00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:01,943
where they said
they were?

00:20:01,943 --> 00:20:03,945
Actually... no.

00:20:03,945 --> 00:20:05,513
If the van was here,

00:20:05,513 --> 00:20:08,616
the tower
they transmitted to

00:20:08,616 --> 00:20:10,051
is at an
impossible angle.

00:20:10,051 --> 00:20:11,719
There's a whole mountain
in the way.

00:20:11,719 --> 00:20:13,654
Why would they lie?

00:20:13,654 --> 00:20:16,791
It's a good question.

00:20:20,194 --> 00:20:21,696
Um, where's Robbie?

00:20:21,696 --> 00:20:23,698
I thought you were
talking to him, too.

00:20:23,698 --> 00:20:25,967
My friend Nick is talking to him
in the next room.

00:20:25,967 --> 00:20:28,836
Just there behind
the mirror.

00:20:30,838 --> 00:20:32,106
ANNOUNCER:
Tonight, on KVKC News

00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:33,908
with Theresa Shea.

00:20:35,243 --> 00:20:36,811
What's this?

00:20:36,811 --> 00:20:39,614
That is the opening
of your newscast two weeks ago.

00:20:39,614 --> 00:20:42,683
THERESA: Welcome to the KVKC
Local News at 11:00.

00:20:42,683 --> 00:20:43,951
I'm Theresa Shea.

00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,753
And I'm Ella St. James.

00:20:45,753 --> 00:20:48,890
Our top story tonight,
Bobby Reed, son of Dennis Reed,

00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:51,158
pleads guilty
to drug charges and...

00:20:53,094 --> 00:20:55,830
Congratulations. Co-anchor.

00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,932
Don't congratulate me;
it didn't last.

00:20:57,932 --> 00:20:59,300
No, it didn't, did it?

00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,135
Just last week,
you were back out in the field

00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:04,238
and it was the Theresa show
all over again.

00:21:04,238 --> 00:21:05,740
What changed?

00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:08,709
Honestly, I don't know.

00:21:08,709 --> 00:21:11,112
It felt like Paulsen was
grooming me to take over.

00:21:11,112 --> 00:21:12,914
I know Theresa felt the same.

00:21:12,914 --> 00:21:15,650
I still have the claw marks.

00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:18,653
So he demoted you
back into the field?

00:21:18,653 --> 00:21:19,854
Mm.

00:21:19,854 --> 00:21:21,756
I was actually fired once.

00:21:21,756 --> 00:21:23,557
Really drove me crazy.

00:21:23,557 --> 00:21:25,126
I think if I was demoted,

00:21:25,126 --> 00:21:27,094
I don't know what
I would have done.

00:21:27,094 --> 00:21:30,865
STOKES: Don't worry about
what's going on in there.

00:21:30,865 --> 00:21:33,100
Worry about what's
going on in here.

00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:36,671
This is your T.O.C. report
from the news station.

00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:39,140
Okay.

00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,575
It tells me you weren't
where you said you were

00:21:41,575 --> 00:21:43,678
when you were
broadcasting.

00:21:43,678 --> 00:21:45,046
Do I need a lawyer?

00:21:45,046 --> 00:21:46,247
It doesn't
matter to me.

00:21:46,247 --> 00:21:47,982
I'll just ask your boss

00:21:47,982 --> 00:21:51,686
if it's possible to prerecord
a live news segment.

00:21:51,686 --> 00:21:54,989
I think we both know
what he's gonna say.

00:21:54,989 --> 00:21:58,025
Of course I fantasized
about killing Theresa.

00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:01,028
But I wouldn't.

00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:03,631
It's not who I am.
Not why I got into news.

00:22:03,631 --> 00:22:05,299
So, it was an ethical thing?

00:22:05,299 --> 00:22:06,901
For starters.

00:22:06,901 --> 00:22:09,170
And, uh, falsifying
a news report?

00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:10,805
It was a weather
stand up.

00:22:10,805 --> 00:22:12,773
Soaking-wet fluff-- they
should've sent Rainy.

00:22:12,773 --> 00:22:14,008
But they sent you.

00:22:14,008 --> 00:22:15,209
Why?

00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:18,012
Not "they"-- Theresa.

00:22:18,012 --> 00:22:19,213
She felt threatened,

00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:21,182
so she alpha-femaled me.

00:22:21,182 --> 00:22:23,017
It was a big "screw you"
to Ella.

00:22:23,017 --> 00:22:24,752
Nobody challenged Theresa.

00:22:24,752 --> 00:22:25,953
Not even Paulsen.

00:22:25,953 --> 00:22:27,521
So, you faked your news report,

00:22:27,521 --> 00:22:29,023
fabricated an alibi,

00:22:29,023 --> 00:22:30,057
snuck into the station...

00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:31,759
No.

00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:33,995
I mean, yes.

00:22:33,995 --> 00:22:35,196
We were sneaking,

00:22:35,196 --> 00:22:38,065
but... for a very
different reason.

00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:39,533
ELLA:
<i>Robby and I,</i>

00:22:39,533 --> 00:22:43,037
we worked closely together.

00:22:43,037 --> 00:22:44,805
We got closer.

00:22:44,805 --> 00:22:47,208
Physical.

00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:49,043
Don't get me wrong,
I'm married...

00:22:49,043 --> 00:22:50,644
And she loves her husband.

00:22:50,644 --> 00:22:52,113
I get that.

00:22:52,113 --> 00:22:54,281
But when we found the time,
we would try to...

00:22:54,281 --> 00:22:56,617
Step away, every
once in a while.

00:22:56,617 --> 00:22:59,186
So when the rain
gig came up,

00:22:59,186 --> 00:23:00,654
we played hooky.

00:23:00,654 --> 00:23:01,889
Went to our usual spot.

00:23:01,889 --> 00:23:04,058
To the King's Bridge Motel...

00:23:04,058 --> 00:23:05,826
on D Street.

00:23:05,826 --> 00:23:07,962
That's fairly close to the tower
you broadcast from.

00:23:07,962 --> 00:23:10,164
(chuckles):
Well,

00:23:10,164 --> 00:23:12,700
I'd ask you for a
receipt, but, uh...

00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,769
It's not exactly
a receipt hotel.

00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:17,772
So, Ella, if you didn't do it,

00:23:17,772 --> 00:23:20,241
maybe you could help us
with who did.

00:23:20,241 --> 00:23:22,243
I don't know who.

00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:26,113
But maybe I know why.

00:23:27,548 --> 00:23:29,250
Theresa was working
on something.

00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,751
A story, a big
one, I think.

00:23:30,751 --> 00:23:32,253
How do you know?

00:23:32,253 --> 00:23:34,555
I started noticing that
she would take her journal

00:23:34,555 --> 00:23:36,690
and her bag with her,
even to the restroom.

00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:38,526
Maybe she was just paranoid.

00:23:38,526 --> 00:23:40,795
She was on a story.

00:23:40,795 --> 00:23:45,132
Despite our differences, Theresa
and I were birds of a feather.

00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:47,601
And back in her day,
she was a hell of

00:23:47,601 --> 00:23:49,870
an investigative reporter.

00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:52,006
She was kind of my idol.

00:23:52,006 --> 00:23:54,041
Well, I did look all through
her work computer,

00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:56,510
and I really didn't find
anything out of the ordinary.

00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:59,847
If it were me, I'd
keep it all at home.

00:24:16,664 --> 00:24:18,232
Nice digs.

00:24:18,232 --> 00:24:21,635
Boy, I'll say.

00:24:21,635 --> 00:24:24,872
Guess it pays a lot better
to report crime

00:24:24,872 --> 00:24:26,907
than it does to solve it.
(laughs)

00:24:26,907 --> 00:24:28,843
Well, you could say
that about any job.

00:24:28,843 --> 00:24:30,911
Except crime--
I heard it doesn't pay.

00:24:30,911 --> 00:24:32,113
(chuckles)

00:24:32,113 --> 00:24:33,781
Warrant served.

00:24:33,781 --> 00:24:35,850
Okay, so...

00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,885
Theresa's working on some
big secret story, right?

00:24:37,885 --> 00:24:39,086
Where does she keep it?

00:24:39,086 --> 00:24:41,288
Not in the living room,
seems untouched.

00:24:41,288 --> 00:24:44,058
Theresa Shea lived alone.

00:24:44,058 --> 00:24:45,292
Right?
Divorced, three times.

00:24:45,292 --> 00:24:46,794
Well, I know

00:24:46,794 --> 00:24:48,762
when I take work home,
sometimes it'll

00:24:48,762 --> 00:24:50,231
make its way into the bedroom.

00:24:50,231 --> 00:24:52,299
Yeah, but you're not single,
you're married.

00:24:52,299 --> 00:24:55,870
Yeah, but, um...

00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:59,773
my place often looks
a lot like this.

00:25:16,924 --> 00:25:18,993
Okay, maybe not exactly
like this.

00:25:18,993 --> 00:25:20,661
Russell?

00:25:20,661 --> 00:25:24,031
I think I just found
what we're looking for.

00:25:24,899 --> 00:25:26,200
Oh, my.

00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,669
Theresa was certainly
into something.

00:25:28,669 --> 00:25:30,271
Like she was obsessed.

00:25:30,271 --> 00:25:32,907
Good chance this obsession is
what got her killed.

00:25:43,951 --> 00:25:47,955
Theresa Shea earned her stripes
as an investigative reporter.

00:25:47,955 --> 00:25:51,225
Looks like she's still got it.
Or had it.

00:25:51,225 --> 00:25:52,826
News clippings,
Internet articles.

00:25:52,826 --> 00:25:54,595
I got copies

00:25:54,595 --> 00:25:58,232
of police reports all marked up
and lots of arson reports.

00:25:58,232 --> 00:26:01,001
All these clippings are about
a series of unsolved warehouse

00:26:01,001 --> 00:26:04,538
and store fires on the east side
17 years ago.

00:26:04,538 --> 00:26:07,308
Why is a superficial
nip-tuck diva

00:26:07,308 --> 00:26:09,743
digging into cold cases
about a firebug?

00:26:09,743 --> 00:26:11,679
She wasn't digging,
she was excavating.

00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:13,781
Yeah, but why was
she so invested?

00:26:13,781 --> 00:26:16,550
She didn't need the story
to advance her career.

00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:17,818
Right?

00:26:17,818 --> 00:26:19,086
Yet, she spent
all her time here.

00:26:21,088 --> 00:26:22,623
She ate all her meals
in here, too.

00:26:22,623 --> 00:26:23,824
Hmm.

00:26:23,824 --> 00:26:25,125
Living alone can drive you

00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:26,527
a little crazy.

00:26:26,527 --> 00:26:28,162
Yeah, well,

00:26:28,162 --> 00:26:30,831
there's crazy and then
there's Colonel Kurtz crazy.

00:26:30,831 --> 00:26:32,032
Mm.

00:26:33,734 --> 00:26:35,869
Maybe she wasn't
always alone.

00:26:35,869 --> 00:26:39,540
One of these wine glasses
is wearing lipstick

00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,808
and the other isn't.

00:26:40,808 --> 00:26:42,009
Wonder who our mystery date is.

00:26:42,009 --> 00:26:44,645
I'll get them to Henry.

00:26:48,916 --> 00:26:50,551
Reporter's notebook.

00:26:50,551 --> 00:26:51,852
Maybe this can
help us make

00:26:51,852 --> 00:26:54,788
sense out of all this
organized chaos.

00:26:54,788 --> 00:26:57,091
What is that writing,
some kind of

00:26:57,091 --> 00:26:58,292
shorthand maybe?

00:26:58,292 --> 00:26:59,960
Gregg style, to be specific.

00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,062
Haven't seen that for years.

00:27:02,062 --> 00:27:06,267
Our victim's
very old school.

00:27:06,267 --> 00:27:08,569
<i>I suppose some of our answers</i>
<i>might be here.</i>

00:27:14,608 --> 00:27:15,843
You must be running
on fumes.

00:27:15,843 --> 00:27:17,077
You should go home.

00:27:17,077 --> 00:27:20,614
Home is where the
coded notebook is.

00:27:20,614 --> 00:27:23,017
(cell phone ringing)

00:27:23,017 --> 00:27:24,718
(ringing stops)

00:27:29,256 --> 00:27:32,626
Have you talked to him
since the NTSB guy?

00:27:32,626 --> 00:27:35,763
Nothing happened
with NTSB.

00:27:35,763 --> 00:27:37,898
How come you can't
pick up the phone?

00:27:37,898 --> 00:27:40,768
Because I feel
like when I do,

00:27:40,768 --> 00:27:42,903
I'm gonna be very
sad when I hang up.

00:27:42,903 --> 00:27:44,905
How do you know?

00:27:44,905 --> 00:27:47,207
'Cause he wants
to talk.

00:27:48,575 --> 00:27:50,944
Want some help?

00:27:50,944 --> 00:27:53,147
Oh, that's...
that's really nice.

00:27:53,147 --> 00:27:55,149
You should go home,
have some fun.

00:27:55,149 --> 00:27:56,817
This is fun.

00:27:56,817 --> 00:27:58,652
I'm really good
at crosswords.

00:27:58,652 --> 00:28:01,522
Yeah, okay.

00:28:01,522 --> 00:28:05,793
Uh, so Gregg style shorthand
is written phonetically.

00:28:05,793 --> 00:28:08,896
"Cat" is "k-a-t,"
knee is "n-e."

00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:10,531
Soft consonants
like "ch"

00:28:10,531 --> 00:28:13,801
and "sh" are
written horizontally.

00:28:13,801 --> 00:28:15,035
And hard consonants like

00:28:15,035 --> 00:28:16,970
"t" and "d"
are written downward.

00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:19,640
Like this.

00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,810
And vowel sounds are
curves and circles.

00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:25,612
Okay, let's crack the code.

00:28:25,612 --> 00:28:27,281
All right.

00:28:27,281 --> 00:28:30,050
♪ ♪

00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:03,217
17 years ago, a series
of warehouse arsons

00:29:03,217 --> 00:29:05,686
in the furniture district
baffled investigators.

00:29:05,686 --> 00:29:08,122
Cases were unsolved
and put on ice.

00:29:08,122 --> 00:29:09,923
But Theresa dug up
lab reports,

00:29:09,923 --> 00:29:12,693
which pointed to dynamite
and wax paper,

00:29:12,693 --> 00:29:15,596
and that looks an awful lot like
a 17-year-old version

00:29:15,596 --> 00:29:17,664
of what blew
that power transformer.

00:29:17,664 --> 00:29:20,067
Do we have a clue as to who
would've made either device?

00:29:20,067 --> 00:29:21,568
No, but Theresa did.

00:29:21,568 --> 00:29:22,836
She referenced
in her journal

00:29:22,836 --> 00:29:24,605
someone named "G.H."

00:29:24,605 --> 00:29:25,873
He was a demolitions expert,

00:29:25,873 --> 00:29:27,541
uh, storied career
in the military.

00:29:27,541 --> 00:29:29,977
He's now working as...
A motivational speaker.

00:29:29,977 --> 00:29:31,979
Didn't you just
investigate a fire?

00:29:31,979 --> 00:29:33,580
Yes, I did--
Garrett Howard.

00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:36,016
He was a retired military
munitions expert.

00:29:36,016 --> 00:29:37,217
So, where's he now?

00:29:37,217 --> 00:29:39,019
He's downstairs.

00:29:44,124 --> 00:29:46,126
SIDLE: Anything of note
with Mr. Howard?

00:29:46,126 --> 00:29:48,195
Well, most people
die in fires

00:29:48,195 --> 00:29:50,130
from smoke inhalation,
not burns.

00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:53,700
But take a look
at this lung.

00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,135
Very clean.

00:29:55,135 --> 00:29:56,870
He didn't die from the fire.

00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:58,705
Nope.

00:29:58,705 --> 00:30:00,107
Did you, by chance,
find anything

00:30:00,107 --> 00:30:01,642
on the back of his neck?

00:30:01,642 --> 00:30:03,977
Your instincts are
good as always.

00:30:03,977 --> 00:30:05,746
Come on around here.

00:30:08,882 --> 00:30:10,551
(grunts)

00:30:10,551 --> 00:30:12,152
There, we got it.

00:30:12,152 --> 00:30:15,956
Knife wound right between
the occipital bone of the skull

00:30:15,956 --> 00:30:17,524
and atlas, C1.

00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:19,693
Consistent with the murder
of Theresa Shea.

00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:21,228
Yeah, right down

00:30:21,228 --> 00:30:23,030
to the green paste.
Mm-hmm.

00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,898
THERESA:
<i>In related news,</i>

00:30:24,898 --> 00:30:26,633
there has been
a rash of vandalism

00:30:26,633 --> 00:30:28,569
across Las Vegas landmarks.

00:30:28,569 --> 00:30:32,172
With the latest hijinks taking
place at the Palermo fountain...

00:30:32,172 --> 00:30:33,974
Yesterday's news?

00:30:33,974 --> 00:30:37,144
And the day before
and the day before that.

00:30:37,144 --> 00:30:39,279
Trying to make sense
out of this whole

00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:42,282
dysfunctional family
of a news team.

00:30:42,282 --> 00:30:44,785
Theresa sucked up
a lot of oxygen.

00:30:44,785 --> 00:30:46,653
I just want to see
if any of her siblings

00:30:46,653 --> 00:30:47,888
look a little short of breath.

00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:49,523
Any luck?
No.

00:30:49,523 --> 00:30:51,525
You?
A little bit.

00:30:51,525 --> 00:30:53,694
Theresa was investigating
a cold case.

00:30:53,694 --> 00:30:55,262
It was serial arson.

00:30:55,262 --> 00:30:57,631
Those famous fires
in the furniture district

00:30:57,631 --> 00:30:59,199
were started
by an explosive device

00:30:59,199 --> 00:31:01,268
that lead us to a current case.

00:31:01,268 --> 00:31:02,669
Which one's that?

00:31:02,669 --> 00:31:04,905
Finlay's dead
motivational speaker.

00:31:04,905 --> 00:31:06,874
Turns out, he was
a demolitions expert.

00:31:06,874 --> 00:31:08,809
And he specialized
in the type of devices

00:31:08,809 --> 00:31:10,944
that were all found
at those old arson sites--

00:31:10,944 --> 00:31:12,279
dynamite with a remote trigger.

00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:13,814
Rings a bell.

00:31:13,814 --> 00:31:15,282
And...

00:31:15,282 --> 00:31:17,518
best that I can tell,
the device was a precursor

00:31:17,518 --> 00:31:20,888
to the explosive device that
you found at the transformer.

00:31:20,888 --> 00:31:24,858
Okay, so the guy 17 years ago
builds incendiary devices

00:31:24,858 --> 00:31:27,094
to start fires,
then nothing.

00:31:27,094 --> 00:31:29,229
Then he blows up
a transformer.

00:31:29,229 --> 00:31:30,697
Why'd he start up again now?

00:31:30,697 --> 00:31:33,700
The similarities
don't end there.

00:31:35,702 --> 00:31:38,138
Guy's wound track has
the same green paste

00:31:38,138 --> 00:31:40,274
as we found
in Theresa's pithing.

00:31:40,274 --> 00:31:42,042
So we're looking at
a locked-room mystery,

00:31:42,042 --> 00:31:43,644
tucked into an enigma,

00:31:43,644 --> 00:31:45,212
wrapped in dynamite paper.

00:31:45,212 --> 00:31:47,214
You can say that again.
(laughs)

00:31:51,084 --> 00:31:52,553
Hey, Sara.

00:31:52,553 --> 00:31:54,021
Let me ask
you something.

00:31:54,021 --> 00:31:56,023
How you doing?
You all right?

00:31:56,023 --> 00:31:57,558
I'm fine.

00:31:57,558 --> 00:32:00,193
Well, you just seemed
a little bit down

00:32:00,193 --> 00:32:02,696
when we were at Theresa's place.

00:32:02,696 --> 00:32:04,731
Um, I don't know, uh,

00:32:04,731 --> 00:32:08,702
woman married to her career
without much to show for it.

00:32:08,702 --> 00:32:11,171
It's a little depressing.

00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:15,008
Yeah, uh...

00:32:15,008 --> 00:32:16,643
I don't mean to pry, but...

00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:17,945
Pause right there.
I know, I know.

00:32:17,945 --> 00:32:19,146
I'm supposed to be your boss.

00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:20,581
Separation of church and state.

00:32:20,581 --> 00:32:22,716
No, no, no, hit,
uh, pause with the remote,

00:32:22,716 --> 00:32:24,251
and-and back it up
a little bit.

00:32:24,251 --> 00:32:25,652
Oh.

00:32:29,156 --> 00:32:30,557
There, you see it?

00:32:30,557 --> 00:32:32,125
Map's not only behind her,

00:32:32,125 --> 00:32:33,860
it's on her dress.

00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,963
I see London, I see France.

00:32:35,963 --> 00:32:37,998
There's only one reason
that we'd be able

00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:39,266
to see that on her dress.

00:32:39,266 --> 00:32:43,203
She's got a green stain on her.

00:32:45,172 --> 00:32:47,574
Well, that's embarrassing.
VARTANN: Worse than that.

00:32:47,574 --> 00:32:49,876
It's incriminating.
What are you talking about?

00:32:49,876 --> 00:32:51,812
We found a green paste
on the body of Theresa

00:32:51,812 --> 00:32:53,213
and also on
a second victim.

00:32:53,213 --> 00:32:55,015
It's a compound used
for sharpening knives.

00:32:55,015 --> 00:32:56,216
It was used
by our killer.

00:32:56,216 --> 00:32:57,618
PAULSEN:
Wait a minute,

00:32:57,618 --> 00:32:59,152
you don't think...
I mean,

00:32:59,152 --> 00:33:00,554
why would Rainy have

00:33:00,554 --> 00:33:02,155
a knife-sharpening paste
on her dress?

00:33:02,155 --> 00:33:04,625
Why don't we let Rainy
answer that question.

00:33:04,625 --> 00:33:06,893
Well, let's see.
Um, clear skies,

00:33:06,893 --> 00:33:08,595
red dress, Wednesday.

00:33:08,595 --> 00:33:10,964
The Doppler network was
funky, so I spent most of

00:33:10,964 --> 00:33:13,900
my time looking over Denny's
shoulder in his cage while

00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,602
he was trying to
fix the connection.

00:33:15,602 --> 00:33:17,704
(phone ringing)
Excuse me.

00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:19,906
Greg, what's going on?

00:33:19,906 --> 00:33:21,875
Hey, you're not gonna
believe this.

00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:24,778
I was just sorting through the
storied career of Garrett Howard

00:33:24,778 --> 00:33:28,749
and came across a familiar name:
Denny Jones.

00:33:28,749 --> 00:33:31,118
In what context?

00:33:31,118 --> 00:33:33,186
He was in the military, too,
briefly.

00:33:33,186 --> 00:33:36,056
He got in trouble
for stealing supplies.

00:33:36,056 --> 00:33:38,058
In and out of the stockade.
Short fuse.

00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:40,260
Was deemed unfit for duty.

00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:42,529
Received a less-than-honorable
discharge.

00:33:42,529 --> 00:33:44,998
So, Denny and Garrett Howard...

00:33:44,998 --> 00:33:46,667
Were brothers in arms.

00:33:46,667 --> 00:33:48,635
Where's Morgan?

00:33:57,911 --> 00:33:59,112
Denny?

00:34:01,014 --> 00:34:02,549
Wait.

00:34:04,618 --> 00:34:05,986
Denny!

00:34:11,224 --> 00:34:14,094
(reporters clamoring)

00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:15,862
We've just seen a man emerge.

00:34:15,862 --> 00:34:18,865
We don't know if he
works for the station.

00:34:18,865 --> 00:34:20,067
Denny.

00:34:20,067 --> 00:34:21,635
Denny, hey.

00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:24,104
(clamoring continues)

00:34:24,104 --> 00:34:25,806
I didn't do anything wrong!

00:34:25,806 --> 00:34:28,075
Okay, okay,
nobody said you did.

00:34:28,075 --> 00:34:29,576
Is that the murder weapon?

00:34:29,576 --> 00:34:32,546
This is my knife, yes,
but it didn't...

00:34:32,546 --> 00:34:34,047
I didn't kill Theresa!

00:34:34,047 --> 00:34:35,682
Hey, drop that knife!
Stay away!

00:34:35,682 --> 00:34:37,284
Everybody move back, move back,
move back.

00:34:37,284 --> 00:34:38,985
Move your camera. Move!

00:34:38,985 --> 00:34:40,787
I didn't kill Theresa,
because she loved me.

00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:42,656
And I loved her, too!
I loved her!

00:34:42,656 --> 00:34:44,157
I... Get away!

00:34:44,157 --> 00:34:45,992
Hey, get the cameras
out of here! I'm serious!

00:34:45,992 --> 00:34:48,095
I believe you.
Let us talk about this.

00:34:48,095 --> 00:34:49,763
No! I will not
go back to jail!

00:34:49,763 --> 00:34:50,997
I cannot go back to jail!

00:34:50,997 --> 00:34:52,532
All we want to do is
take you in.

00:34:52,532 --> 00:34:54,601
Just gonna go have
a conversation.
Stop!

00:34:54,601 --> 00:34:56,136
You drop that knife right now!

00:34:56,136 --> 00:34:58,638
No, this is just, this is all
just too much.

00:34:58,638 --> 00:34:59,873
Denny, listen to me, calm down.

00:34:59,873 --> 00:35:01,108
You don't want to do this.

00:35:01,108 --> 00:35:02,743
Now come on. Denny...

00:35:02,743 --> 00:35:05,011
(voices overlapping, fading)

00:35:05,011 --> 00:35:06,847
(echoing):
Denny. Denny.

00:35:10,617 --> 00:35:12,185
No!

00:35:12,185 --> 00:35:13,587
(crowd gasping)

00:35:13,587 --> 00:35:16,823
Wait!
Why'd you do that?!

00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:18,959
Denny, okay...
Can you see this?

00:35:18,959 --> 00:35:20,527
(reporters clamoring)

00:35:20,527 --> 00:35:23,130
Move back, will ya, please?

00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:24,631
Look at me.
I'm here.

00:35:24,631 --> 00:35:26,266
I got you.

00:35:26,266 --> 00:35:28,034
Move!

00:35:30,904 --> 00:35:32,639
(siren wailing)

00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:35,709
(talking quietly)

00:35:35,709 --> 00:35:38,211
Denny. Denny.

00:35:38,211 --> 00:35:40,213
(clamoring continues)

00:35:47,087 --> 00:35:49,756
Unlike lightning, tragedy
tragedy strikes twice at KVKC.

00:35:49,756 --> 00:35:53,293
I'm at the site of yet a second
violent death in as many days,

00:35:53,293 --> 00:35:56,563
as the news station is rocked
to its foundation

00:35:56,563 --> 00:35:58,165
by the suicide of a man

00:35:58,165 --> 00:36:01,268
suspected in the murder
of Theresa Shea.

00:36:01,268 --> 00:36:04,237
Embroiled in a mystery
that keeps on unraveling,

00:36:04,237 --> 00:36:05,972
authorities have kept quiet
thus far,

00:36:05,972 --> 00:36:07,307
but the man who killed himself

00:36:07,307 --> 00:36:10,043
has been identified
as Denny Jones.

00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:12,012
So what motivated these events?

00:36:12,012 --> 00:36:14,848
Psychotic break?
Crime of passion?

00:36:14,848 --> 00:36:18,752
Until the facts come in,
one can only speculate.

00:36:19,986 --> 00:36:22,088
(mutters):
Stupid.

00:36:23,256 --> 00:36:24,991
Okay, okay, okay.

00:36:26,993 --> 00:36:28,862
Boss?
Yeah?

00:36:28,862 --> 00:36:30,297
I have an update
on the wine glass

00:36:30,297 --> 00:36:31,798
we found at Theresa Shea's.

00:36:31,798 --> 00:36:33,600
Thought you didn't
find a match.

00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,101
No, we didn't until
the knife came in.

00:36:35,101 --> 00:36:37,671
But sweat around the handle
matched the DNA on the glass.

00:36:37,671 --> 00:36:41,208
Denny was sharing wine
with Theresa.

00:36:41,208 --> 00:36:42,776
And sharing a bed.

00:36:42,776 --> 00:36:44,578
I found evidence
of sexual activity

00:36:44,578 --> 00:36:46,146
in her sheets.

00:36:46,146 --> 00:36:47,781
Strange bedfellows.

00:36:47,781 --> 00:36:49,149
Everybody needs somebody.

00:36:49,149 --> 00:36:51,284
But if he was in love,
why kill her?

00:36:51,284 --> 00:36:54,054
I don't know.

00:36:54,054 --> 00:36:56,656
Love makes you do
all sorts of stupid things.

00:36:56,656 --> 00:36:59,025
You don't think he did it,
do you?

00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,761
Sorry.

00:37:03,096 --> 00:37:04,598
Okay, this is gonna be fun.

00:37:04,598 --> 00:37:06,600
Now, when we came into this,

00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,301
we had three suspects
and no evidence, right?

00:37:08,301 --> 00:37:10,704
Now we got some
evidence,

00:37:10,704 --> 00:37:12,305
I want to play a little game.

00:37:12,305 --> 00:37:14,207
Capture the flag.

00:37:15,242 --> 00:37:16,643
Bear with me.

00:37:16,643 --> 00:37:18,211
Okay, this particular flag

00:37:18,211 --> 00:37:20,513
is gonna represent
Theresa Shea's life.

00:37:20,513 --> 00:37:22,282
We're gonna stick it right here.

00:37:22,282 --> 00:37:24,150
Sara, you're gonna be
playing Theresa.

00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:28,088
Three of you are each gonna be
playing one of our suspects.

00:37:28,088 --> 00:37:31,057
Now you'll start from wherever
our evidence placed them.

00:37:31,057 --> 00:37:32,792
We'll turn off the lights.

00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:36,930
Whoever can get in,
take Theresa's life and get out

00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:40,667
in 20 seconds is our killer.

00:37:42,202 --> 00:37:44,004
20 seconds to airtime.
Are you good?

00:37:44,004 --> 00:37:47,874
I'm gonna be playing
Mr. Paulsen.

00:37:47,874 --> 00:37:49,276
Sara, you're my
anchor, right?

00:37:49,276 --> 00:37:50,977
Alive and well.

00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:52,279
Okay, Greg,
where are you at?

00:37:52,279 --> 00:37:54,648
All right,
I am at the coffee machine,

00:37:54,648 --> 00:37:57,183
about to go to the garage
and make a deposit.

00:37:57,183 --> 00:37:58,685
I'm at my Doppler station.

00:37:58,685 --> 00:38:00,186
I'm monitoring the storm
as instructed.

00:38:00,186 --> 00:38:03,056
Computer puts Rainy here
until the lights go out.

00:38:03,056 --> 00:38:04,257
RUSSELL:
Thank you, Rainy.

00:38:04,257 --> 00:38:05,659
Denny?

00:38:05,659 --> 00:38:07,227
I'm in my cage.

00:38:07,227 --> 00:38:10,797
Internet activity locks me here
until we lose power.

00:38:10,797 --> 00:38:12,232
As soon as the
lights go out,

00:38:12,232 --> 00:38:14,067
I want everyone
to try to kill Sara.

00:38:14,067 --> 00:38:17,170
Ready, set,

00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:18,571
go.

00:38:18,571 --> 00:38:19,806
(lights clank)

00:38:19,806 --> 00:38:22,175
VARTANN:
19, 18, 17,

00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:24,277
16, 15, 14,

00:38:24,277 --> 00:38:27,113
13, 12, 11,

00:38:27,113 --> 00:38:29,516
ten, nine,

00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:31,651
eight, seven,

00:38:31,651 --> 00:38:32,852
six, five,

00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:34,721
four, three,

00:38:34,721 --> 00:38:37,223
two, one. Lights up.

00:38:37,223 --> 00:38:38,758
(lights clank)

00:38:46,633 --> 00:38:48,601
Well, Chad was too far away.

00:38:48,601 --> 00:38:49,803
And Denny was, too.

00:38:49,803 --> 00:38:51,638
Rainy couldn't get to Theresa.

00:38:51,638 --> 00:38:53,273
None of us made it in time.

00:38:53,273 --> 00:38:55,909
Yeah, but...

00:38:55,909 --> 00:38:57,177
the flag is gone.

00:38:58,945 --> 00:39:00,146
Well, who took it then?

00:39:00,146 --> 00:39:01,614
(knocking)

00:39:06,987 --> 00:39:09,055
You were all
too far away,

00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:11,992
because you were sent
too far away by me.

00:39:11,992 --> 00:39:13,727
Detective, did you see me
leave this room?

00:39:13,727 --> 00:39:14,995
No, I did not.

00:39:14,995 --> 00:39:17,130
And as far as everyone
in here knew,

00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:18,732
Paulsen never left either.

00:39:18,732 --> 00:39:20,934
Theresa, pull it back.
Go three.

00:39:20,934 --> 00:39:22,936
THERESA:
Thanks, Ella.

00:39:22,936 --> 00:39:25,305
(phone beeps, dials)
We'll try to get
that sound sorted out.

00:39:25,305 --> 00:39:27,841
RUSSELL: <i>Blew up the power,</i>
<i>stepped outside,</i>

00:39:27,841 --> 00:39:31,111
<i>took care of Theresa,</i>
<i>got back in the room</i>

00:39:31,111 --> 00:39:33,646
<i>before the generator kicked on.</i>

00:39:33,646 --> 00:39:35,248
Theresa, are you okay?

00:39:37,183 --> 00:39:40,520
SIDLE:
Do these... articles

00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:43,089
look familiar to you?

00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:45,091
Yeah, let me give you
a hint-- the A.P.

00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:46,926
credits the photographs
to a younger you.

00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:48,595
Yeah.

00:39:48,595 --> 00:39:51,564
I took pictures of
the furniture district fires.

00:39:51,564 --> 00:39:53,566
You know, they never
caught that guy.

00:39:53,566 --> 00:39:54,834
Never say never.

00:39:54,834 --> 00:39:56,169
What's that
supposed to mean?

00:39:56,169 --> 00:39:57,871
RUSSELL: You know what?
Let's talk about

00:39:57,871 --> 00:39:59,639
your old pal, Garrett Howard.

00:39:59,639 --> 00:40:01,541
The one who liked to play
with dynamite.

00:40:01,541 --> 00:40:02,742
I don't know a Garrett Howard.

00:40:02,742 --> 00:40:04,010
Really?

00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:06,546
And yet, you did
a whole profile on him

00:40:06,546 --> 00:40:08,048
on one of your news shows.

00:40:08,048 --> 00:40:09,883
What was it called?
Uh...

00:40:09,883 --> 00:40:13,153
"Army demolition expert
turns motivational speaker."

00:40:13,153 --> 00:40:16,222
That's a hell of a favor to do
for somebody you don't know.

00:40:16,222 --> 00:40:17,891
SIDLE:
And not the only favor.

00:40:17,891 --> 00:40:20,894
You also hired his hapless
army buddy, Denny Jones.

00:40:20,894 --> 00:40:24,864
So he gave you the job
as a favor to a friend?

00:40:24,864 --> 00:40:26,566
How does that work?

00:40:26,566 --> 00:40:28,868
Um, Garrett said Paulsen
owes him his life.

00:40:28,868 --> 00:40:30,203
Any idea why?

00:40:30,203 --> 00:40:32,605
Denny and Theresa together. Wow.

00:40:32,605 --> 00:40:34,007
I didn't see that coming.

00:40:34,007 --> 00:40:35,742
Did you see
that coming?
No.

00:40:35,742 --> 00:40:37,777
No, that must have come
as a surprise to you, too.

00:40:37,777 --> 00:40:39,112
And now...

00:40:39,112 --> 00:40:40,947
Theresa knew
that you had a secret.

00:40:40,947 --> 00:40:42,949
<i>She figured if she could</i>
<i>uncover it, then she could</i>

00:40:42,949 --> 00:40:44,751
<i>keep her job. You wanted</i>

00:40:44,751 --> 00:40:47,253
<i>to have her replaced</i>
<i>with a younger anchorwoman.</i>

00:40:47,253 --> 00:40:49,989
<i>So she became</i>
<i>a one-woman news team.</i>

00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:52,592
And she connected you
to these fires 17 years ago.

00:40:52,592 --> 00:40:56,262
First one on the scene
because you lit the match.

00:40:56,262 --> 00:40:58,765
That must've given Theresa
a lot of leverage.

00:40:58,765 --> 00:40:59,999
Leverage?

00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:01,701
She was a
washed-up talent.

00:41:01,701 --> 00:41:03,002
Her best years were behind her.

00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:05,805
Why'd you keep her
on the anchor desk then?

00:41:05,805 --> 00:41:07,307
See, to me,
that sounds like a...

00:41:07,307 --> 00:41:08,775
deal with the devil.

00:41:08,775 --> 00:41:10,310
SIDLE: Yeah, one
you couldn't live with.

00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:12,278
So you made a plan
to kill Theresa.

00:41:12,278 --> 00:41:13,947
RUSSELL:
Asked Garrett Howard

00:41:13,947 --> 00:41:16,749
for another explosive device--
just one more job.

00:41:16,749 --> 00:41:21,154
<i>But then, like Theresa,</i>
<i>he knew your secret.</i>

00:41:21,154 --> 00:41:23,857
<i>So you had</i>
<i>to dispose of him, too.</i>

00:41:28,094 --> 00:41:31,164
SIDLE:
<i>And that left poor Denny.</i>

00:41:31,164 --> 00:41:34,701
<i>So you borrowed his knife,</i>
<i>and you set him up.</i>

00:41:34,701 --> 00:41:37,003
(chuckles):
I'm a reporter.

00:41:37,003 --> 00:41:38,872
I'm not a murderer.

00:41:38,872 --> 00:41:40,607
I wouldn't even know
how to wield a knife.

00:41:40,607 --> 00:41:42,175
Hate to fact-check you
on that, pal, but...

00:41:42,175 --> 00:41:43,910
You know, actually,
I'm loving this.

00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:45,678
We found

00:41:45,678 --> 00:41:47,814
an old news story
that you ran years ago

00:41:47,814 --> 00:41:51,017
about a killer who stabbed his
victim right in the sweet spot,

00:41:51,017 --> 00:41:52,218
right under the skull.

00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:53,653
SIDLE:
When you take notes,

00:41:53,653 --> 00:41:55,922
you really take notes.

00:41:55,922 --> 00:41:57,657
You know, in my business,

00:41:57,657 --> 00:41:59,526
before making

00:41:59,526 --> 00:42:02,662
outrageous accusations,
on or off the air,

00:42:02,662 --> 00:42:05,131
you need a little thing
called evidence.

00:42:05,131 --> 00:42:07,867
In our business, too.

00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:15,074
This is a partial print
from the transformer explosions.

00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:17,610
It's also
your left index finger.

00:42:19,112 --> 00:42:21,047
Oops.

00:42:23,049 --> 00:42:25,051
RAINY:
<i>Welcome to the KVKC</i>

00:42:25,051 --> 00:42:27,720
local news at 11:00.
I'm Jennifer Thomas.

00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:30,623
Breaking news tonight--
which sadly hits close to home--

00:42:30,623 --> 00:42:32,192
long-time news producer

00:42:32,192 --> 00:42:34,994
Fred Paulsen has been charged
with first-degree murder

00:42:34,994 --> 00:42:36,930
in the death of Theresa Shea.

00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:38,932
(cell phone ringing)

00:42:45,004 --> 00:42:47,006
(turns off TV)

00:42:53,012 --> 00:42:54,681
Hello.

GRISSOM: You've been hard
to get a hold of.

00:42:57,517 --> 00:43:01,254

How are you?

00:43:03,089 --> 00:43:06,726
I'm okay.
