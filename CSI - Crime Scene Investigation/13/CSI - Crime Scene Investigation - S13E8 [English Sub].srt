00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:05,615
(coyotes howling)

00:00:16,726 --> 00:00:19,328
(indistinct radio communication,
siren whoops)

00:00:25,795 --> 00:00:28,731
I saw a movie that
started like this.

00:00:28,731 --> 00:00:29,865
It did not end well.

00:00:29,865 --> 00:00:31,000
Alien invasion.

00:00:33,602 --> 00:00:35,471
Sheriff Anderson, Davis County.

00:00:35,471 --> 00:00:36,505
Thanks for coming.

00:00:36,505 --> 00:00:38,474
CSI Russell,
CSI Finlay.

00:00:38,474 --> 00:00:40,576
What's with all the men
in black?

00:00:40,576 --> 00:00:42,812
ANDERSON:
Nellis Air Force Base
is down the road.

00:00:42,812 --> 00:00:45,281
Apparently they just broke
a very expensive toy.

00:00:45,281 --> 00:00:47,783
You said something
about a grave over the phone?

00:00:47,783 --> 00:00:49,618
A couple hikers called
in about a light show.

00:00:49,618 --> 00:00:50,853
I was first
on the scene.

00:00:50,853 --> 00:00:52,288
I noticed some disturbed earth.

00:00:52,288 --> 00:00:53,022
Want to follow me?

00:00:55,691 --> 00:00:59,528
Three tours in Iraq,
saw my share of mass graves.

00:00:59,528 --> 00:01:02,064
They looked
just like this.

00:01:02,064 --> 00:01:04,600
RUSSELL:
Roughly three
meters square.

00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,369
Vegetation has
barely grown back.

00:01:07,369 --> 00:01:10,339
FINLAY:
Desert varnish is on the
ground side of the rock,

00:01:10,339 --> 00:01:12,408
should be on the side
facing the sun.

00:01:12,408 --> 00:01:13,876
This area's definitely
been worked.

00:01:13,876 --> 00:01:15,611
There's only one reason

00:01:15,611 --> 00:01:18,714
to dig a hole this far out
in the middle of nowhere.

00:01:27,556 --> 00:01:28,524
Oh, here you go.

00:01:33,629 --> 00:01:36,031
Bracelet says that it's female.

00:01:36,031 --> 00:01:37,032
RUSSELL:
Right.

00:01:37,032 --> 00:01:38,434
WOMAN:
Excuse me.

00:01:38,434 --> 00:01:40,903
This is a Federal
investigation.

00:01:40,903 --> 00:01:42,571
You're in a
restricted area.

00:01:42,571 --> 00:01:44,740
Well, ma'am, we just found
a buried body,

00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,376
so this is now
an LVPD crime scene.

00:01:47,376 --> 00:01:49,044
You're gonna have
to leave the area.
You know,

00:01:49,044 --> 00:01:51,780
if you keep insisting,
you're gonna be in violation

00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,316
of NRS197-point-190.

00:01:54,316 --> 00:01:55,985
Interfering with
public officers

00:01:55,985 --> 00:01:57,987
in the discharge
of their official duties.

00:01:57,987 --> 00:01:59,355
FINLAY:
In other words, our body

00:01:59,355 --> 00:02:01,023
trumps your <i>X-Files</i> convention.

00:02:01,023 --> 00:02:02,358
Right.

00:02:05,027 --> 00:02:07,563
Let them have their grave,
keep them out of my hair.

00:02:07,563 --> 00:02:10,666
That's the first time

PHILLIPS:
Tissue on the extremities
and skull is largely gone.

00:02:49,872 --> 00:02:51,707
Remaining tissue is desiccated.

00:02:51,707 --> 00:02:53,542
What's it smell like?

00:02:55,778 --> 00:02:57,813
(sniffs)

00:02:57,813 --> 00:02:59,648
Smells like dirt.

00:02:59,648 --> 00:03:02,051
It means the body's been buried
for more than five years.

00:03:02,051 --> 00:03:04,720
David, hold the camera
steady, please.

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,889
Yeah.
Well, the body's

00:03:06,889 --> 00:03:08,657
strangely preserved.

00:03:08,657 --> 00:03:11,827
Much lighter than what
we're accustomed to seeing.

00:03:11,827 --> 00:03:13,596
How many bodies so far?

00:03:13,596 --> 00:03:15,064
Three.

00:03:15,064 --> 00:03:16,398
They all appear
to be female.

00:03:16,398 --> 00:03:19,802
Another desiccated
fern leaf.

00:03:19,802 --> 00:03:21,971
Unless these bodies were buried
in the Jurassic age,

00:03:21,971 --> 00:03:24,340
they're not from around here.
RUSSELL: And neither's

00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,041
this dark, rich soil.

00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:28,877
Could be that the bodies were
buried somewhere else,

00:03:28,877 --> 00:03:30,646
and then moved here.

00:03:30,646 --> 00:03:33,616
Look at that-- military sure
took off in a hell of a hurry.

00:03:33,616 --> 00:03:36,385
I think you scared them, Finn.

00:03:36,385 --> 00:03:37,519
(laughs)

00:03:44,994 --> 00:03:46,061
Oh, Lord...

00:03:49,331 --> 00:03:50,532
Got number four over here.

00:03:52,501 --> 00:03:54,637
This one's...

00:03:54,637 --> 00:03:56,372
different from the others.

00:03:56,372 --> 00:03:57,906
Completely mummified.

00:03:57,906 --> 00:03:59,642
Yeah, tissue's black.

00:03:59,642 --> 00:04:03,512
Look at the facial features.

00:04:03,512 --> 00:04:05,848
<i>Distorted from bloating,</i>
<i>and the color change is</i>

00:04:05,848 --> 00:04:08,584
<i>from bacterial activity.</i>

00:04:08,584 --> 00:04:10,586
Which means that she was
exposed to the elements

00:04:10,586 --> 00:04:11,987
shortly after death.

00:04:11,987 --> 00:04:14,323
So maybe she wasn't buried
for very long

00:04:14,323 --> 00:04:15,658
before she
was moved here.

00:04:15,658 --> 00:04:16,925
The question is

00:04:16,925 --> 00:04:19,495
where were they
all buried first?

00:04:19,495 --> 00:04:21,363
Rich, dark soil, fern leaves?

00:04:21,363 --> 00:04:23,565
My money's
on northern climes.

00:04:23,565 --> 00:04:24,867
more north than Northern Nevada.

00:04:27,903 --> 00:04:29,672
(gasps)

00:04:35,644 --> 00:04:37,479
David...

00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:39,682
removing a necklace.

00:04:56,732 --> 00:04:58,033
What you got?

00:04:58,033 --> 00:05:01,070
One of a kind, vintage pendant,

00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,772
one carat small diamonds.

00:05:03,772 --> 00:05:05,741
flowery design,

00:05:05,741 --> 00:05:08,310
16-inch silver

00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,478
Coreana chain.

00:05:09,478 --> 00:05:11,880
Two years and 1,200 miles--

00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,615
we found her.

00:05:13,615 --> 00:05:15,017
I haven't heard
from Janet.

00:05:15,017 --> 00:05:16,919
Something is wrong--
Janet and I talk every day.

00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:18,487
She's a good girl.
Dr. Warren,

00:05:18,487 --> 00:05:19,722
We're doing everything
we can to find Janet.

00:05:19,722 --> 00:05:20,989
Were you able

00:05:20,989 --> 00:05:22,591
to find me
a recent photo of her?

00:05:25,928 --> 00:05:28,030
Please find my daughter.

00:05:29,598 --> 00:05:31,400
I would like to be the one

00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,302
to notify
Janet Warren's mother.

00:05:33,302 --> 00:05:36,705
As soon as we have
positive I.D., we notify.

00:05:36,705 --> 00:05:38,340
(watch alarm beeps)
Do me a favor.

00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,642
Greg's down at Autopsy,
working the bodies.

00:05:40,642 --> 00:05:42,044
Go help him out, will you?

00:05:42,044 --> 00:05:44,646
I can't believe that
Dr. Warren has had to wait

00:05:44,646 --> 00:05:45,781
two years for this moment.

00:05:45,781 --> 00:05:46,982
The last thing
you should do

00:05:46,982 --> 00:05:48,417
right now is
give that woman

00:05:48,417 --> 00:05:49,952
bad information.
Come on.

00:05:49,952 --> 00:05:51,954
What are the chances
that it is not Janet?

00:05:51,954 --> 00:05:53,589
Okay, the necklace.

00:05:53,589 --> 00:05:55,858
The condition
of her body, the soil.

00:05:55,858 --> 00:05:57,559
It all points north

00:05:57,559 --> 00:05:59,728
Yeah.
to Seattle,
to Tom Cooley's ranch.

00:05:59,728 --> 00:06:02,464
Finn, you're getting ahead
of the evidence. Again.

00:06:02,464 --> 00:06:05,567
He moved her body when
we turned up the heat.

00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:08,670
But you know what we didn't know
back then, that we know now?

00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,806
Janet Warren was
not the only victim.

00:06:10,806 --> 00:06:12,975
This guy is a serial killer.

00:06:12,975 --> 00:06:15,344
Who sued the crap out of you.

00:06:15,344 --> 00:06:18,547
And the Seattle PD,
last time around.

00:06:18,547 --> 00:06:21,717
And that was with one body,
we got eight now, Finn.

00:06:25,521 --> 00:06:27,456
You know I'm right.

00:06:29,358 --> 00:06:32,728
And for the record, I am not
getting ahead of the evidence.

00:06:32,728 --> 00:06:34,930
Just go help Greg, please?

00:06:44,673 --> 00:06:45,674
Where's Janet Warren?

00:06:45,674 --> 00:06:47,376
She's in there.

00:06:47,376 --> 00:06:49,845
She should move
to the head of the line.

00:06:49,845 --> 00:06:51,547
That's not your call.

00:06:51,547 --> 00:06:53,015
Well, can you make it yours?

00:06:53,015 --> 00:06:54,383
(laughs)

00:06:56,752 --> 00:06:59,321
Why are you working on her?

00:06:59,321 --> 00:07:02,424
We really need to confirm
Janet Warren's I.D.

00:07:02,424 --> 00:07:05,294
Well, isn't that why Russell
sent us both down here?

00:07:05,294 --> 00:07:07,596
(sighs)

00:07:07,596 --> 00:07:10,065
Have you ever had a case
that kept you up at night?

00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,769
I have been awake for two years.

00:07:16,038 --> 00:07:18,407
(sighs)

00:07:31,019 --> 00:07:34,022
Hey, we all know about you
and your case with

00:07:34,022 --> 00:07:36,491
Janet Warren, and we're a team.

00:07:36,491 --> 00:07:39,494
So if you're in,
we're in.

00:07:39,494 --> 00:07:41,930
Let's get this Cooley guy.

00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:43,966
Thank you, Greg.

00:07:43,966 --> 00:07:45,467
Okay.

00:07:45,467 --> 00:07:49,972
Get her printed,
and, uh, when you run DNA,

00:07:49,972 --> 00:07:51,573
can you do her first?

00:07:51,573 --> 00:07:53,742
You do know that
I'm not the DNA tech anymore.

00:07:53,742 --> 00:07:55,510
I promise you I'll
make it up to you.

00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:57,679
(sighs)

00:08:23,605 --> 00:08:25,641
Another finger bone for you.

00:08:25,641 --> 00:08:27,643
Speaking of giving
someone the finger,

00:08:27,643 --> 00:08:29,411
Finn compromised
a case in Seattle

00:08:29,411 --> 00:08:31,413
by illegally obtaining
DNA evidence.

00:08:31,413 --> 00:08:32,814
They had hair,

00:08:32,814 --> 00:08:34,816
carpet fibers and semen
from Janet Warren's car.

00:08:34,816 --> 00:08:37,319
Finn went after
the suspect's exemplars.

00:08:37,319 --> 00:08:39,554
Why didn't she
just get a warrant?

00:08:39,554 --> 00:08:40,889
Guy was juiced.

00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:43,325
Son of Seattle,
lots of money, lots of friends.

00:08:43,325 --> 00:08:45,627
And from what I heard,
he had a snake for a lawyer.

00:08:45,627 --> 00:08:47,696
Well, snake or not, if this guy
Cooley's good for one,

00:08:47,696 --> 00:08:50,365
he's good for all eight.

00:08:50,365 --> 00:08:52,467
Hey, look what I found.

00:08:52,467 --> 00:08:53,702
It's a ring.

00:08:55,037 --> 00:08:56,471
Looks like a man's.

00:08:56,471 --> 00:08:58,674
So far, all the bodies
have been female.

00:08:58,674 --> 00:09:01,009
Maybe our killer left
something behind?

00:09:05,914 --> 00:09:09,785
So, I found a lot of interesting
insects at the gravesite.

00:09:09,785 --> 00:09:11,586
A lot of them are
not locally abundant.

00:09:11,586 --> 00:09:13,889
Yeah, I recognize
the rain beetle, there.

00:09:13,889 --> 00:09:14,957
<i>Pleocoma australis--</i>

00:09:14,957 --> 00:09:16,058
How do you know that one?

00:09:16,058 --> 00:09:17,492
Aw, I had them on a case once.

00:09:17,492 --> 00:09:18,860
Found a body

00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,996
in a shipping container--
the rain beetle

00:09:20,996 --> 00:09:23,465
told us that she'd been buried
on land first.

00:09:23,465 --> 00:09:25,734
Any idea of
post-mortem interval?

00:09:25,734 --> 00:09:28,370
No, but I think
I can give you a location.

00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:31,273
This beetle,
and the western thatching ant,

00:09:31,273 --> 00:09:32,674
tell me that the bodies were
originally buried

00:09:32,674 --> 00:09:34,309
in the Pacific Northwest.

00:09:34,309 --> 00:09:37,279
This is the pink millipede,
found in

00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,648
the agricultural areas
of Washington state.

00:09:39,648 --> 00:09:42,551
Okay, well that narrows
it down considerably.

00:09:42,551 --> 00:09:43,885
Yeah, but this last one
is the reason

00:09:43,885 --> 00:09:45,554
you should probably
give me a pay raise.

00:09:45,554 --> 00:09:46,722
The horntail,

00:09:46,722 --> 00:09:48,991
<i>Xeris tarsalis,</i> game changer.

00:09:48,991 --> 00:09:51,893
narrows it down even further,
puts the bodies

00:09:51,893 --> 00:09:53,929
just outside the Seattle
metropolitan area.

00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:57,766
Okay.

00:09:57,766 --> 00:09:59,835
Well, next question is

00:09:59,835 --> 00:10:03,505
why were eight bodies already
buried just outside of Seattle,

00:10:03,505 --> 00:10:06,908
dug up and moved
to who-knows-where, Nevada?

00:10:06,908 --> 00:10:08,477
Yeah, a place so remote,

00:10:08,477 --> 00:10:10,412
you'd have to know
where it was to find it.

00:10:10,412 --> 00:10:11,913
That's a good question.

00:10:42,277 --> 00:10:43,278
Hey.

00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:44,446
Greg.

00:10:44,446 --> 00:10:45,680
Have you seen Finn?
Yeah.

00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,349
I just got off
the phone with her.

00:10:47,349 --> 00:10:48,417
Gave her the good news.

00:10:48,417 --> 00:10:49,951
Well, now you'll give it to me.

00:10:49,951 --> 00:10:52,521
Prints confirmed--
it's Janet Warren.

00:10:55,457 --> 00:10:56,925
(phone beeps)

00:10:56,925 --> 00:10:58,293
(keypad beeping)

00:10:58,293 --> 00:11:00,729
Hi, this is Finn,
leave a message.

00:11:00,729 --> 00:11:02,664
Oh, come on, Finn.

00:11:05,367 --> 00:11:07,736
I just talked to her.

00:11:16,478 --> 00:11:17,913
Are you keeping tabs
on all of us?

00:11:17,913 --> 00:11:19,915
Thought you needed
my permission

00:11:19,915 --> 00:11:21,817
before you can...
track me.

00:11:21,817 --> 00:11:23,285
Exigent circumstances.

00:11:23,285 --> 00:11:25,587
Hey, Mike, it's D.B. Russell.

00:11:25,587 --> 00:11:26,688
How you been?

00:11:26,688 --> 00:11:28,623
Got a little problem.

00:11:38,467 --> 00:11:40,402
(siren whoops)

00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:56,618
Step out of the vehicle, ma'am.

00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:04,292
(sighs)

00:12:04,292 --> 00:12:07,796
I see they busted you
back to working traffic.

00:12:07,796 --> 00:12:09,631
This how you getting
your dates these days, Mike?

00:12:09,631 --> 00:12:11,032
You know, I'm kind of hurt
you're back in Seattle,

00:12:11,032 --> 00:12:12,300
and didn't give me a call.

00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,802
Well, I'm only here for a day.

00:12:13,802 --> 00:12:15,303
Yeah, that's what
D.B. figured.

00:12:15,303 --> 00:12:18,039
Of course he called you.

00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:19,608
Hmph.

00:12:19,608 --> 00:12:20,809
I thought once I signed
the divorce papers

00:12:20,809 --> 00:12:22,277
I'd never have to see you again.

00:12:23,745 --> 00:12:25,614
Here, get in my car.
We're going for a ride.

00:12:25,614 --> 00:12:26,648
Are you arresting me?

00:12:26,648 --> 00:12:28,016
Because if you actually

00:12:28,016 --> 00:12:29,951
talked to D.B.,
you would know why I'm here.

00:12:29,951 --> 00:12:32,654
With or without cuffs,
it's your call.

00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,809
Where the hell are we?

00:12:54,809 --> 00:12:57,012
Trying to help you out,
here, Jules.

00:12:57,012 --> 00:12:58,713
Uh, could you please
not call me Jules?

00:12:58,713 --> 00:13:00,882
That brings back a lot
of bad memories.

00:13:00,882 --> 00:13:03,051
Yeah, I've heard your
version of our marriage.

00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:10,525
You found Janet Warren's body,

00:13:10,525 --> 00:13:13,461
and some evidence that
she was buried in Seattle.

00:13:13,461 --> 00:13:15,530
Now you think that you
have all that you need

00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:17,666
to get that warrant
to dig up Cooley's ranch.

00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:20,402
Well... you're too late.

00:13:20,402 --> 00:13:21,870
That son of a bitch.

00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:24,339
After he moved the bodies,
he covered his tracks.

00:13:24,339 --> 00:13:25,774
There's no evidence
that the bodies

00:13:25,774 --> 00:13:27,275
were ever even buried here.

00:13:27,275 --> 00:13:28,643
Well, you been gone
for two years.

00:13:28,643 --> 00:13:30,579
A lot of things have changed.

00:13:32,647 --> 00:13:34,549
You can't go tearing down
these people's homes.

00:13:34,549 --> 00:13:35,951
All right?

00:13:35,951 --> 00:13:37,586
If Janet and the other girls
were buried down there,

00:13:37,586 --> 00:13:38,820
we'll never know now.

00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,056
You know Cooley did it.

00:13:41,056 --> 00:13:42,424
Jules...

00:13:42,424 --> 00:13:43,992
you got a new job,
a new life.

00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,596
Don't screw it up this time.

00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,732
Look, I'll drive you
back to the airport.

00:13:50,732 --> 00:13:53,501
You could drop me at my car.

00:13:53,501 --> 00:13:57,005
I'm not leaving until
I see Janet Warren's mother.

00:13:57,005 --> 00:13:58,373
She deserves to know.

00:13:58,373 --> 00:13:59,674
(laughs)

00:13:59,674 --> 00:14:01,643
The press already
took care of that.

00:14:01,643 --> 00:14:02,911
She's already on
her way to Vegas.

00:14:04,446 --> 00:14:05,880
ROBBINS:
<i>Dr. Warren,</i>

00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,982
you're not going in there.

00:14:06,982 --> 00:14:08,917
I am not just any
grieving mother,

00:14:08,917 --> 00:14:10,385
I am a doctor,
I'm a pediatrician,

00:14:10,385 --> 00:14:11,953
I've seen it all.

00:14:11,953 --> 00:14:14,589
But you've never seen your own
daughter dead on a slab.

00:14:14,589 --> 00:14:16,324
I appreciate your concern.

00:14:16,324 --> 00:14:17,859
I need to say good-bye.

00:14:17,859 --> 00:14:21,596
Janet was identified based on
fingerprints and DNA.

00:14:21,596 --> 00:14:24,666
Her physical features,
as you remember them, are gone.

00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,568
You don't want this to be
your last memory of her.

00:14:26,568 --> 00:14:28,970
Are you so desensitized to death

00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,505
you can't even
understand how I feel

00:14:30,505 --> 00:14:32,307
after two years of searching?

00:14:32,307 --> 00:14:33,341
Monica...

00:14:33,341 --> 00:14:34,909
(sighs)

00:14:34,909 --> 00:14:36,578
Doctor, I believe
you know CSI Russell.

00:14:36,578 --> 00:14:38,280
I'm so sorry.

00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,348
I'm sorry we weren't able
to give you the answers

00:14:40,348 --> 00:14:41,950
you were looking for in Seattle.

00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:44,286
Well, you're giving
them to me now.

00:14:44,286 --> 00:14:45,420
And for that,
I'm grateful.

00:14:46,655 --> 00:14:49,391
Now, I'd like to
see my daughter.

00:14:49,391 --> 00:14:52,460
ROBBINS:
Dr. Warren...

00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,795
please take some
friendly advice.

00:14:53,795 --> 00:14:55,730
Remember your daughter
in happier times.

00:15:03,705 --> 00:15:05,507
This is the only way
that I can be sure.

00:15:07,575 --> 00:15:09,511
Sit with me,
just for a second.

00:15:13,948 --> 00:15:16,751
You remember CSI Finlay?

00:15:16,751 --> 00:15:18,453
Yes.

00:15:18,453 --> 00:15:21,056
Well... she found this

00:15:21,056 --> 00:15:23,591
on her body.

00:15:23,591 --> 00:15:25,527
(sobs)

00:15:28,763 --> 00:15:30,699
(crying):
Oh...

00:15:37,872 --> 00:15:40,275
You've given me Janet back.

00:15:43,812 --> 00:15:47,282
Now go get that son of a bitch.

00:15:49,851 --> 00:15:51,586
(buzzes)

00:15:51,586 --> 00:15:54,055
Uh, your cell phone
is blowing up.

00:15:54,055 --> 00:15:55,423
Yeah.

00:15:55,423 --> 00:15:57,359
That's why I
left it over there.

00:16:01,663 --> 00:16:02,831
(laughs sarcastically)

00:16:02,831 --> 00:16:05,800
Finn is under
the impression that I am

00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,669
her personal assistant.

00:16:07,669 --> 00:16:10,038
If she's gonna get fired again,
I am not gonna go down with her.

00:16:10,038 --> 00:16:12,273
Nobody is getting fired.

00:16:12,273 --> 00:16:14,376
Haven't you ever been
passionate about a case before?

00:16:14,376 --> 00:16:17,746
I am passionate about
a lot of things.

00:16:17,746 --> 00:16:19,047
Okay, so....

00:16:20,515 --> 00:16:22,450
Take a look at this.

00:16:25,854 --> 00:16:27,589
Been working on
that ring I found.

00:16:32,527 --> 00:16:33,895
Hardison High School,

00:16:33,895 --> 00:16:35,463
Class of 1987.

00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,734
Hardison High.

00:16:39,734 --> 00:16:41,603
15 miles outside Seattle.

00:16:41,603 --> 00:16:42,871
Any photos of the class of '87?

00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,709
Huh. She was limber.

00:16:47,709 --> 00:16:48,810
Bet you can't do that.

00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:49,744
(clears throat)

00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,448
Look who was
Senior Class President.

00:16:53,448 --> 00:16:54,816
Tom Cooley.

00:16:54,816 --> 00:16:56,684
Voted "Most Likely to
Become a Serial Killer."

00:16:56,684 --> 00:16:57,952
(cell phone buzzing)

00:16:57,952 --> 00:16:59,554
Time to answer your phone.

00:17:13,334 --> 00:17:14,936
DNA hits on two of
your Jane Does.

00:17:14,936 --> 00:17:17,472
Stephanie Hollinger...

00:17:17,472 --> 00:17:19,374
and Sunshine Vanletti.

00:17:19,374 --> 00:17:21,676
Now, Stephanie
went missing in 1999.

00:17:21,676 --> 00:17:24,746
She was a 21-year-old
coed from UCLA

00:17:24,746 --> 00:17:26,047
in Seattle for a Walk-and-Run.

00:17:26,047 --> 00:17:28,049
Last seen at a place
called Endless Lounge.

00:17:28,049 --> 00:17:31,052
Trendy bar in Capitol District.

00:17:31,052 --> 00:17:32,420
What about the other girl?

00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,488
Went missing in '02.

00:17:33,488 --> 00:17:36,624
23-year-old fitness instructor,

00:17:36,624 --> 00:17:39,027
worked nights as
a cocktail waitress at Zobo.

00:17:39,027 --> 00:17:40,929
Also in the Capitol District.

00:17:40,929 --> 00:17:43,998
You know, that's the same area
that Janet Warren went missing.

00:17:43,998 --> 00:17:47,635
This could be
Tom Cooley's hunting ground.

00:17:47,635 --> 00:17:49,771
He had an office
right around the corner.

00:17:49,771 --> 00:17:51,506
Well, he didn't have
to work that hard.

00:17:51,506 --> 00:17:54,008
Tox results showed high levels
of flunitrazepam.

00:17:54,008 --> 00:17:55,944
Date rape drug.

00:17:58,046 --> 00:18:01,916
Early 20's, athletic, blond...

00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:03,885
Most of the bodies showed
signs of strangulation,

00:18:03,885 --> 00:18:05,753
broken hyoids...

00:18:05,753 --> 00:18:07,489
M.O. is up close and personal.

00:18:07,489 --> 00:18:09,424
He likes to look in
their eyes as they die.

00:18:09,424 --> 00:18:11,459
Guy's a sadist.

00:18:11,459 --> 00:18:13,328
Lures them in,
sexually assaults them,

00:18:13,328 --> 00:18:14,329
and then strangles them.

00:18:14,329 --> 00:18:15,997
Take a look at this.

00:18:15,997 --> 00:18:19,067
A couple weeks after
Janet disappeared,

00:18:19,067 --> 00:18:21,069
a witness came forward

00:18:21,069 --> 00:18:22,437
with this cell phone video.

00:18:22,437 --> 00:18:23,638
Last time Janet was seen alive.

00:18:23,638 --> 00:18:25,840
HENRY:
With Tom Cooley.
Mm-hmm.

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,642
Her hand's on his thigh.

00:18:29,878 --> 00:18:32,747
Giving him permission
to take her home.

00:18:32,747 --> 00:18:35,350
Hi, this is Captain Robinson
with the, uh,

00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:37,318
Seattle Police Department.

00:18:37,318 --> 00:18:38,720
Um, we're conducting

00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,388
a murder investigation,
and we're searching for

00:18:40,388 --> 00:18:42,423
a list of students who purchased

00:18:42,423 --> 00:18:47,795
a 1987 Hardison High School
class ring.

00:18:47,795 --> 00:18:48,730
Yeah, I'll hold.

00:18:50,565 --> 00:18:52,033
Hmm...

00:18:53,535 --> 00:18:54,936
What did the poor
thing wear home?

00:18:54,936 --> 00:18:56,738
A smile.

00:19:00,475 --> 00:19:01,509
Yeah, I'm here.

00:19:01,509 --> 00:19:02,443
Oh, great.

00:19:02,443 --> 00:19:03,645
Could you e-mail me that list?

00:19:03,645 --> 00:19:04,846
Thanks.
Excuse me, "Captain."

00:19:04,846 --> 00:19:06,548
Remember, our guy
lost his ring.

00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:10,852
Was there anybody on that list

00:19:10,852 --> 00:19:12,554
that ordered a replacement ring?

00:19:12,554 --> 00:19:13,855
Yeah, a second ring.

00:19:13,855 --> 00:19:14,956
There is one.

00:19:14,956 --> 00:19:16,357
What's the name?

00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:19,694
Eric Louie.

00:19:19,694 --> 00:19:21,429
L-O-U-I-E.

00:19:21,429 --> 00:19:24,699
Is there anybody else?

00:19:24,699 --> 00:19:26,801
Okay. Thanks.

00:19:26,801 --> 00:19:28,536
What, you think
it'd be that easy?

00:19:28,536 --> 00:19:29,837
She'd say "Cooley,"
and you'd say "Get in jail?"

00:19:29,837 --> 00:19:31,272
Let's go.

00:19:31,272 --> 00:19:33,541
Any good Seattle cop
knows Eric Louie.

00:19:35,977 --> 00:19:37,779
CHILD:
Love you, Daddy!

00:19:37,779 --> 00:19:38,713
ERIC:
Bye, guys.

00:19:45,887 --> 00:19:47,689
Hey, Mikey.

00:19:47,689 --> 00:19:49,290
What the hell you doing
in this neck of the woods?

00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:50,425
Well, we're following a lead

00:19:50,425 --> 00:19:51,626
in the Janet Warren case.

00:19:51,626 --> 00:19:52,760
Oh, yeah.

00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,395
Heard about that
in morning briefing.

00:19:54,395 --> 00:19:55,863
I know you.

00:19:55,863 --> 00:19:57,398
You're a CSI.

00:19:57,398 --> 00:19:58,967
Fired a couple
years ago, yeah?

00:19:58,967 --> 00:20:00,735
Uh, resigned in lieu of.

00:20:00,735 --> 00:20:02,904
FINLAY:
Officer Louie, we would
like to ask you

00:20:02,904 --> 00:20:06,541
some questions about your
1987 Hardison High class ring.

00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:07,942
The one you lost?

00:20:07,942 --> 00:20:10,478
Thought you were working
the Janet Warren case.

00:20:10,478 --> 00:20:11,913
Oh, we are.

00:20:11,913 --> 00:20:14,482
CSI Finlay here's with
the Vegas lab these days.

00:20:14,482 --> 00:20:16,851
We found your ring
in our mass grave.

00:20:18,019 --> 00:20:20,288
That sounds like
an accusation.

00:20:20,288 --> 00:20:21,656
Do I need my guild rep, Mikey?

00:20:21,656 --> 00:20:23,958
No. Just tell us
how you lost the ring.

00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:25,793
(indistinct radio communication)

00:20:25,793 --> 00:20:27,562
Well, I didn't lose it.

00:20:27,562 --> 00:20:29,664
I gave it to my
high school sweetheart.

00:20:29,664 --> 00:20:31,032
She told me she lost it,

00:20:31,032 --> 00:20:33,067
right after she dumped me
for the quarterback.

00:20:33,067 --> 00:20:35,503
Well, I figured
she tossed it.

00:20:35,503 --> 00:20:37,505
Marla always was a bitch.

00:20:37,505 --> 00:20:39,907
Have you seen
this "bitch" lately?

00:20:39,907 --> 00:20:41,843
Yeah. In the kitchen.

00:20:41,843 --> 00:20:43,544
I married her.

00:20:43,544 --> 00:20:44,579
Marla!

00:20:47,615 --> 00:20:49,717
These guys want to
ask you some questions.

00:20:49,717 --> 00:20:50,818
They're okay, yeah?

00:20:50,818 --> 00:20:52,854
I gotta get back to work.

00:20:52,854 --> 00:20:53,988
If you're done with me.

00:20:53,988 --> 00:20:55,723
Yeah. Thank you.
All right.

00:20:58,326 --> 00:20:59,794
Coffee?

00:20:59,794 --> 00:21:01,029
Sure.

00:21:01,029 --> 00:21:02,764
Fresh pot.

00:21:02,764 --> 00:21:04,499
Thank you.
Sure.

00:21:04,499 --> 00:21:06,434
Yeah, I know Eric
doesn't believe me,

00:21:06,434 --> 00:21:07,835
but I did lose
his class ring.

00:21:07,835 --> 00:21:09,337
Wore it on a chain.

00:21:09,337 --> 00:21:10,738
It could've fallen off anywhere.

00:21:10,738 --> 00:21:12,306
I was kind of wild back then.

00:21:12,306 --> 00:21:15,309
Do you know where
you might have lost it,

00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:16,611
or what you might
have been doing?

00:21:16,611 --> 00:21:17,945
Dating most of
the football team?

00:21:17,945 --> 00:21:19,981
Eric went through
the cheerleaders.

00:21:19,981 --> 00:21:21,449
We were young, then.

00:21:21,449 --> 00:21:24,452
Did you ever date
a guy named Tom Cooley?

00:21:24,452 --> 00:21:26,054
No way.

00:21:26,054 --> 00:21:30,491
I-I did date his best friend,
for a week or two.

00:21:30,491 --> 00:21:31,592
Max Liston?

00:21:31,592 --> 00:21:33,061
Quarterback.

00:21:33,061 --> 00:21:35,463
Really got Eric
thinking about me.

00:21:35,463 --> 00:21:37,799
You think...

00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:39,934
Tom is responsible
for all those girls?

00:21:41,302 --> 00:21:42,603
Did he kill them?

00:21:42,603 --> 00:21:43,871
Well, that's what
we're investigating.

00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:48,810
Did you and Max ever
hang out with Tom?
Once.

00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:51,913
<i>Max took me to a party</i>
<i>at Tom Cooley's ranch.</i>

00:21:51,913 --> 00:21:54,716
<i>High-class booze,</i>
<i>beer in bottles...</i>

00:21:54,716 --> 00:21:56,851
<i>kind of a step up for me.</i>

00:21:56,851 --> 00:21:58,853
Was that around the time
that you lost the ring?

00:21:58,853 --> 00:22:01,489
Maybe.

00:22:01,489 --> 00:22:02,724
I don't know.
If I knew

00:22:02,724 --> 00:22:05,026
where it went,
it wouldn't be lost.

00:22:05,026 --> 00:22:08,830
Like I said, I only went out
with Max a couple of times.

00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:09,964
Anyone besides me

00:22:09,964 --> 00:22:11,466
need a refill
on the coffee?

00:22:11,466 --> 00:22:14,335
No, no, I'm good,
thanks.

00:22:14,335 --> 00:22:16,771
She's hiding something.

00:22:16,771 --> 00:22:18,706
Yeah.

00:22:20,808 --> 00:22:22,643
Look, her husband's a cop,
you know?

00:22:22,643 --> 00:22:24,045
If Marla Louie
is hiding something,

00:22:24,045 --> 00:22:25,513
it could simply be something

00:22:25,513 --> 00:22:26,981
she doesn't want
her husband to know.

00:22:26,981 --> 00:22:28,416
And that would make you

00:22:28,416 --> 00:22:29,851
zero-for-two up there.

00:22:29,851 --> 00:22:31,786
Is that your nice way
of telling me

00:22:31,786 --> 00:22:32,954
that I shouldn't have
come up here

00:22:32,954 --> 00:22:34,422
without getting your permission?

00:22:34,422 --> 00:22:35,757
You shouldn't have
gone up, period.

00:22:35,757 --> 00:22:37,892
I mean, come on,
what are you doing, Jules?

00:22:37,892 --> 00:22:39,827
Are you trying
to kill your career?

00:22:39,827 --> 00:22:41,329
Marla Louie dated

00:22:41,329 --> 00:22:43,931
Tom Cooley's best friend
in high school,

00:22:43,931 --> 00:22:45,800
this guy named Max Liston,
all right?

00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,803
I'm gonna send you a link.

00:22:51,305 --> 00:22:54,509
"Max Liston, small-time Seattle
contractor,

00:22:54,509 --> 00:22:57,278
"gets big break.

00:22:57,278 --> 00:23:01,482
Cooley hired Liston to
develop the family ranch."

00:23:01,482 --> 00:23:02,650
Not just to develop,

00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:04,919
but to pave over eight graves.

00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:06,954
If I wanted to dig up

00:23:06,954 --> 00:23:09,457
eight bodies in Seattle
and rebury them in Nevada,

00:23:09,457 --> 00:23:14,328
I'd would definitely negotiate
with my contractor best buddy.

00:23:14,328 --> 00:23:15,830
Can we prove any of this?

00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:17,565
Well, here's where I go 1-for-3.

00:23:17,565 --> 00:23:19,767
Max Liston became
an instant millionaire,

00:23:19,767 --> 00:23:22,303
and he retired
to the Virgin Islands.

00:23:22,303 --> 00:23:25,306
Hey, don't even think about
taking an island cruise.

00:23:25,306 --> 00:23:26,674
Well, you don't have to worry.

00:23:26,674 --> 00:23:28,676
Even I couldn't get
this guy to talk.

00:23:28,676 --> 00:23:30,344
BRASS:
<i>So Max Liston gets</i>

00:23:30,344 --> 00:23:33,414
a truckload of money
and dies three weeks later.

00:23:33,414 --> 00:23:36,284
I'd be interested to know what
Tom Cooley was doing

00:23:36,284 --> 00:23:38,886
while Max was flunking
scuba diving.

00:23:38,886 --> 00:23:41,289
Boss, you might want
to turn on the TV.

00:23:41,289 --> 00:23:42,557
Really? Okay.

00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:49,397
Today I've come to Las Vegas to
offer a reward

00:23:49,397 --> 00:23:51,799
of $100,000
for information

00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:54,001
leading to the arrest
and conviction

00:23:54,001 --> 00:23:55,903
of the killer of Janet Warren.

00:23:55,903 --> 00:23:59,707
In the last 24 hours,
Las Vegas PD has confirmed

00:23:59,707 --> 00:24:02,610
the bodies of Janet Warren
and seven other young women were

00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:06,013
recovered from a mass grave
200 miles from here.

00:24:06,013 --> 00:24:09,450
Two years ago,
a chance meeting with Janet

00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:11,919
at a public restaurant on
the last night of her life,

00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,655
turned my life
into a nightmare.

00:24:14,655 --> 00:24:16,490
RUSSELL:
Look at that.

00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:18,826
He's making this about himself.
Now he's the victim.

00:24:18,826 --> 00:24:20,862
(over TV):
...my reputation destroyed.

00:24:20,862 --> 00:24:22,797
I have been pursued
with a vengeance

00:24:22,797 --> 00:24:25,833
by an overzealous CSI who has

00:24:25,833 --> 00:24:27,969
had no regard whatsoever
for the evidence.

00:24:27,969 --> 00:24:29,403
(scoffs)

00:24:29,403 --> 00:24:31,038
Jules, you mind
putting down the coffee mug?

00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:32,740
Can you believe this?!

00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:36,711
...cost her her job...

00:24:36,711 --> 00:24:39,313
but it cost me everything.

00:24:39,313 --> 00:24:41,949
The killer of Janet Warren is
still out there.

00:24:41,949 --> 00:24:43,885
Let's all of us work together
to get him.

00:24:43,885 --> 00:24:45,319
Scumbag!

00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:46,754
He's playing games with us.

00:24:46,754 --> 00:24:48,823
He thinks we're too stupid
to catch him.

00:24:48,823 --> 00:24:51,425
No! Not the TV!

00:24:51,425 --> 00:24:52,960
It's my TV. I paid for it.

00:24:57,632 --> 00:24:59,967
What you got?
Hey.

00:24:59,967 --> 00:25:02,403
Okay, well, this is where
we found the bodies.

00:25:02,403 --> 00:25:04,505
It's federal land that
was taken from a private party

00:25:04,505 --> 00:25:06,340
by eminent domain.

00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:08,843
It was part of a big government
land grab in the '90s.

00:25:08,843 --> 00:25:12,013
A "Covenant of Appurtenant."
What the hell's that?

00:25:12,013 --> 00:25:13,447
It's a lawyer's
way of saying

00:25:13,447 --> 00:25:14,715
that land can never
be developed.

00:25:14,715 --> 00:25:16,350
Good place to bury a body.

00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:18,986
No one's ever digging it up.

00:25:18,986 --> 00:25:21,322
Who was
the previous owner?

00:25:21,322 --> 00:25:23,958
It was buried under layers
of straw corporations,

00:25:23,958 --> 00:25:26,394
but the law firm that
handled the deal was

00:25:26,394 --> 00:25:27,528
Denton, Rutman
and Schmidt.

00:25:27,528 --> 00:25:30,398
Whoa. Now, they are
the biggest

00:25:30,398 --> 00:25:31,532
real estate firm
in Seattle.

00:25:31,532 --> 00:25:33,434
Really?

00:25:33,434 --> 00:25:36,804
Tom Cooley's family made all
their money in real estate.

00:25:36,804 --> 00:25:38,506
So that could've been
Cooley land.

00:25:38,506 --> 00:25:41,475
It it was, that would be enough
to compel his DNA.

00:25:41,475 --> 00:25:43,844
Yes, sir, it would.

00:25:43,844 --> 00:25:45,713
My client will not be
offering up his DNA.

00:25:45,713 --> 00:25:48,482
We both know that particular
glass is off the table.

00:25:48,482 --> 00:25:51,419
How is CSI Finlay?

00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:52,820
She's terrific.

00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:55,356
Mr. Pearson, if your client
wants to be so helpful,

00:25:55,356 --> 00:25:57,491
what the hell's he doing
hanging out in the hall?

00:25:57,491 --> 00:25:59,994
He's just waiting for me
to make sure his rights
will be protected.

00:25:59,994 --> 00:26:00,995
This isn't Guantanamo.

00:26:00,995 --> 00:26:02,530
(chuckles)
Okay.

00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:03,531
Tom?

00:26:06,434 --> 00:26:08,903
Captain Jim Brass,
Tom Cooley.

00:26:08,903 --> 00:26:11,605
Pleasure to meet
you, Captain.

00:26:11,605 --> 00:26:12,807
Sit down.

00:26:12,807 --> 00:26:16,744
Now, Seattle PD was
investigating you

00:26:16,744 --> 00:26:19,347
as a suspect in the
murder of Janet Warren.

00:26:19,347 --> 00:26:22,750
Here in Las Vegas, I'm making
you the prime suspect

00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,385
in the murder
of Stephanie Hollinger.

00:26:24,385 --> 00:26:28,656
Sunshine Vanletti, five
Jane Does and Janet Warren.

00:26:28,656 --> 00:26:30,658
Well, this is no way to
start a relationship, Jim.

00:26:30,658 --> 00:26:32,526
Captain Brass,
we came here...

00:26:32,526 --> 00:26:34,729
I've had a crash course
in the legal system

00:26:34,729 --> 00:26:36,530
in the last couple years.

00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:38,799
You can't arrest me just because
you don't like me.

00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:42,036
If I could arrest you, you'd
already be in a holding cell.

00:26:43,871 --> 00:26:46,507
Now, the victims
we've identified so far

00:26:46,507 --> 00:26:48,609
were all last seen a few blocks
from your office.

00:26:48,609 --> 00:26:49,910
Heart of downtown Seattle.

00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:51,779
Population
half a million.

00:26:51,779 --> 00:26:53,014
And the evidence suggests that

00:26:53,014 --> 00:26:54,515
the bodies were buried
in Seattle,

00:26:54,515 --> 00:26:55,716
then reburied here in Nevada.

00:26:55,716 --> 00:26:56,951
Now, that requires logistics.

00:26:56,951 --> 00:26:58,886
I mean like a dump truck
and a backhoe.

00:27:00,621 --> 00:27:03,024
It's a shame
about your friend Max Liston.

00:27:03,024 --> 00:27:05,593
We understand he did a lot
of construction work for you.

00:27:05,593 --> 00:27:07,795
Max was a dear friend
and a good man.

00:27:07,795 --> 00:27:08,929
If you're suggesting...

00:27:08,929 --> 00:27:11,499
I'm not <i>suggesting</i> anything.

00:27:11,499 --> 00:27:13,000
But what I don't get is,

00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,871
why did you rebury them
1,200 miles from home?

00:27:16,871 --> 00:27:18,806
What happened in Seattle?

00:27:18,806 --> 00:27:21,542
CSI Finlay put your feet
too close to the fire?

00:27:21,542 --> 00:27:23,377
You had to get out
of state?
Okay, that's it.

00:27:23,377 --> 00:27:24,478
Captain,
we're done here.

00:27:24,478 --> 00:27:25,713
These unsubstantiated
accusations,

00:27:25,713 --> 00:27:27,281
they're bordering on slander.

00:27:27,281 --> 00:27:28,816
And I was just getting started.

00:27:28,816 --> 00:27:30,718
PEARSON:
We're staying at
the Mediterranean,

00:27:30,718 --> 00:27:32,486
if there's anything
else we can do.

00:27:32,486 --> 00:27:34,422
Mr. Cooley, thank you
for coming in,

00:27:34,422 --> 00:27:36,457
but don't leave Las Vegas.

00:28:02,616 --> 00:28:03,951
(pounding on door)

00:28:10,458 --> 00:28:11,826
What the hell...?

00:28:11,826 --> 00:28:13,060
Ah, single malt.

00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:17,498
One bottle down,
one to go. Nice.

00:28:17,498 --> 00:28:19,066
(scotch pouring)

00:28:19,066 --> 00:28:21,068
Hey, could you give me
your glass when you're done?

00:28:21,068 --> 00:28:22,570
I was hoping I'd see you.

00:28:24,371 --> 00:28:27,308
How about a drink?

00:28:27,308 --> 00:28:30,311
Yeah, that's how
it all starts, huh?

00:28:30,311 --> 00:28:32,546
Some blonde
catches your eye.

00:28:32,546 --> 00:28:35,783
Young, athletic,
looking for a good time.

00:28:35,783 --> 00:28:37,318
And you buy her a drink.

00:28:37,318 --> 00:28:39,653
Hell, maybe three.

00:28:39,653 --> 00:28:42,423
And you add a little sweetener;
a little flunitrazepam.

00:28:44,425 --> 00:28:46,894
Must be hard for a guy
like you to sleep at night.

00:28:46,894 --> 00:28:50,698
You spend a lot of time
thinking about me.

00:28:50,698 --> 00:28:51,832
I'm flattered.

00:28:51,832 --> 00:28:53,534
I'm just
getting started.

00:28:53,534 --> 00:28:56,704
Just like you, I don't want
the party to end.

00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:58,005
So what happens next, huh?

00:28:58,005 --> 00:29:01,742
You say say something
like, uh...

00:29:01,742 --> 00:29:05,379
"Hey, baby,
just a short drive

00:29:05,379 --> 00:29:08,382
to my big fancy ranch."

00:29:08,382 --> 00:29:09,950
And then, in her car,

00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:13,587
you get the sex part
out of the way

00:29:13,587 --> 00:29:15,723
because you can't wait
to get home

00:29:15,723 --> 00:29:18,058
and get your hands around
their necks.

00:29:20,494 --> 00:29:22,796
I am your type, aren't I?

00:29:24,732 --> 00:29:26,834
Five-foot four, blonde...

00:29:26,834 --> 00:29:29,703
I'm looking for
a good time.

00:29:29,703 --> 00:29:33,707
But I don't expect much
from you in bed...

00:29:33,707 --> 00:29:35,342
'cause you're inadequate.

00:29:36,911 --> 00:29:38,979
Is that your trigger?

00:29:38,979 --> 00:29:43,384
How do you know
I'm not gonna kill <i>you,</i> hmm?

00:29:43,384 --> 00:29:47,321
That's what makes it
so exciting.

00:29:55,763 --> 00:29:59,066
(phone rings)

00:29:59,066 --> 00:30:01,435
Hey, Jim.

00:30:01,435 --> 00:30:03,537
Uh, she should be here
in a few minutes.

00:30:03,537 --> 00:30:05,039
Landed about an hour ago.

00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:07,274
Why? What's up?

00:30:07,274 --> 00:30:09,877
Oh.

00:30:09,877 --> 00:30:12,012
Okay, I'll be right there.

00:30:14,481 --> 00:30:15,482
Hey.

00:30:15,482 --> 00:30:16,717
Hi.

00:30:16,717 --> 00:30:20,688
I just got a 419
at the Mediterranean.

00:30:20,688 --> 00:30:22,890
Sounds like Tom Cooley just
committed suicide,

00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:26,594
sometime in
the last couple hours.

00:30:26,594 --> 00:30:28,596
Try in the last 30 minutes.

00:30:30,998 --> 00:30:32,399
Look, I know you're angry.

00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,301
I know you think
I let you down.

00:30:34,301 --> 00:30:36,503
But I'm not the same person
I was two years ago.

00:30:36,503 --> 00:30:38,272
So you weren't in
Cooley's suite?

00:30:38,272 --> 00:30:39,440
I can explain.

00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,808
Look, come here...

00:30:40,808 --> 00:30:43,811
But Dad, the soda machine
stole my dollar.

00:30:43,811 --> 00:30:44,812
It's Vegas, kiddo.

00:30:44,812 --> 00:30:46,547
Stick to the
table games.

00:30:46,547 --> 00:30:47,915
Internal Affairs is gonna
ask me questions.

00:30:47,915 --> 00:30:49,550
So you be very careful
what you say.

00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:51,619
I'm not gonna lie for you.

00:30:51,619 --> 00:30:54,455
Let's go.
Mr. Pearson, this officer's
gonna accompany you

00:30:54,455 --> 00:30:56,423
to the police station,
take your statement.

00:30:56,423 --> 00:30:57,992
Yeah, of course.

00:30:57,992 --> 00:30:59,827
I can't even begin
to understand this.

00:30:59,827 --> 00:31:00,961
What do we got?

00:31:00,961 --> 00:31:02,630
Gavin Pearson,

00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:04,598
Tom Cooley's lawyer.

00:31:04,598 --> 00:31:06,467
Supposed to meet Cooley
at the bar.

00:31:06,467 --> 00:31:07,534
Cooley was a no-show.

00:31:07,534 --> 00:31:08,869
He came up here
looking for him.

00:31:08,869 --> 00:31:10,738
Banging the door,
there was no response,

00:31:10,738 --> 00:31:12,573
so he called hotel security,
and they cut their way in.

00:31:12,573 --> 00:31:13,841
Can I get
a little help here?

00:31:13,841 --> 00:31:15,476
Yeah. Charles,
keep your eye on him.

00:31:15,476 --> 00:31:17,678
You mind?
No, go ahead.

00:31:17,678 --> 00:31:18,946
No, no, hold on.

00:31:20,814 --> 00:31:24,485
So a room service waiter gave
a statement on the record

00:31:24,485 --> 00:31:25,886
that said he saw

00:31:25,886 --> 00:31:28,355
an angry blonde woman with
police credentials

00:31:28,355 --> 00:31:29,857
and a service pistol

00:31:29,857 --> 00:31:31,825
banging on the door
of Cooley's suite

00:31:31,825 --> 00:31:33,560
a half an hour before
Security arrived.

00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,863
Now tell me that isn't you.

00:31:38,332 --> 00:31:41,001
Stay here--I'm gonna need
to take your statement.

00:31:41,001 --> 00:31:43,504
You know, this isn't
just your job on the line.

00:31:49,009 --> 00:31:52,413
Wow.
Unusual way to hang yourself.

00:31:52,413 --> 00:31:53,714
Usually, you find them hanging

00:31:53,714 --> 00:31:55,549
from the sprinkler head
or a curtain rod.

00:31:55,549 --> 00:31:59,753
As long as the hang point's
longer than your torso...

00:31:59,753 --> 00:32:02,423
<i>that's all it takes.</i>

00:32:07,428 --> 00:32:08,829
Are we gonna find
your fingerprints

00:32:08,829 --> 00:32:10,497
on one of these glasses?

00:32:10,497 --> 00:32:11,932
RUSSELL: Flunitrazepam.
This is the drug

00:32:11,932 --> 00:32:13,801
that Henry's finding
in all his victims.

00:32:15,836 --> 00:32:17,871
BRASS: Both of the doors were
locked from the inside.

00:32:17,871 --> 00:32:19,473
That works in your favor.

00:32:19,473 --> 00:32:21,942
A narcissist does not hold
a press conference

00:32:21,942 --> 00:32:24,611
and then, a few hours later,
kill himself.

00:32:24,611 --> 00:32:26,747
Are you sure that's the argument
you want to make?

00:32:26,747 --> 00:32:28,782
Yeah.
It's a homicide.

00:32:28,782 --> 00:32:30,617
And we need to find out
who did it.

00:32:30,617 --> 00:32:31,885
Well, whatever happened here,

00:32:31,885 --> 00:32:33,654
you're finally gonna get
your DNA sample.

00:32:40,961 --> 00:32:44,331
If I were Janet Warren's
mother, I'd feel cheated.

00:32:44,331 --> 00:32:45,799
I'd want to face
this guy down in court,

00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:47,301
tell the world
what he did,

00:32:47,301 --> 00:32:49,536
and watch him be punished
for his crimes.

00:32:49,536 --> 00:32:51,939
Well, not in this lifetime.

00:32:51,939 --> 00:32:54,041
So what are you
thinking for C.O.D.?

00:32:54,041 --> 00:32:57,010
Asphyxiation due
to ligature strangulation.

00:32:57,010 --> 00:32:59,880
Suicide versus homicide,
still undetermined.

00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:04,351
Henry found flunitrazepam,
50 micrograms per milliliter.

00:33:04,351 --> 00:33:06,420
BAC was point two-one.

00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:08,322
Alcohol three times
the legal level,

00:33:08,322 --> 00:33:09,723
plus a heavy sedative.

00:33:09,723 --> 00:33:11,625
Finn said he was wasted.

00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:14,628
And tying a knot
requires a certain dexterity.

00:33:14,628 --> 00:33:15,763
Think he could
accomplish that?

00:33:15,763 --> 00:33:16,997
Eh, maybe, maybe not.

00:33:16,997 --> 00:33:19,299
Mr. Cooley here
had a fatty liver.

00:33:19,299 --> 00:33:20,901
He was a boozer.

00:33:20,901 --> 00:33:23,437
And most likely,
he built up a tolerance.

00:33:23,437 --> 00:33:24,805
Okay, until
we're certain,

00:33:24,805 --> 00:33:26,807
we're treating this
as a homicide.

00:33:26,807 --> 00:33:27,975
I got Cooley's DNA results.

00:33:27,975 --> 00:33:29,710
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Out of my autopsy

00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:32,045
until you've been cleared
as a suspect, okay?

00:33:35,315 --> 00:33:38,552
Did you give
your statement to Brass yet?

00:33:38,552 --> 00:33:40,454
I'm waiting
for his call.

00:33:40,454 --> 00:33:43,957
Cooley's DNA
matches the semen we found

00:33:43,957 --> 00:33:46,326
in Janet Warren's car
two years ago.

00:33:46,326 --> 00:33:47,394
Okay, it's official.

00:33:47,394 --> 00:33:48,862
He killed Janet.

00:33:48,862 --> 00:33:50,364
That solves
one murder.

00:33:50,364 --> 00:33:51,732
Yeah, how about all eight.

00:33:51,732 --> 00:33:53,333
This guy has been
murdering women

00:33:53,333 --> 00:33:54,501
for the last
20 years.

00:33:54,501 --> 00:33:55,836
I don't think
he suddenly

00:33:55,836 --> 00:33:58,338
grew a conscience
and committed suicide.

00:33:58,338 --> 00:34:00,974
So what's the motive
for murdering him, then?

00:34:00,974 --> 00:34:03,577
Cooley's not the type
to get his hands dirty.

00:34:03,577 --> 00:34:06,346
We believe that he had help
moving the bodies.

00:34:06,346 --> 00:34:07,347
Max Liston.

00:34:07,347 --> 00:34:08,449
But he drowned.

00:34:08,449 --> 00:34:09,783
He's out.

00:34:09,783 --> 00:34:11,518
Cooley's got
another best friend.

00:34:11,518 --> 00:34:14,788
So, Cooley goes down,
his best friend would go down.

00:34:14,788 --> 00:34:16,824
Cooley's dead, case closed.

00:34:17,925 --> 00:34:18,926
So, who is it?

00:34:18,926 --> 00:34:20,894
I don't know.

00:34:20,894 --> 00:34:23,530
But I think I know
someone who might.

00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:25,299
You call me.

00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:32,773
Look, I'm sorry
that you wasted a trip,

00:34:32,773 --> 00:34:36,743
but I already told you
everything I remember.

00:34:36,743 --> 00:34:39,480
Well, you must know by now
that Tom Cooley is dead.

00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,614
He can't hurt you anymore.

00:34:40,614 --> 00:34:41,949
Who said he ever hurt me?

00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:43,684
FINLAY:
Marla, listen to me.

00:34:43,684 --> 00:34:46,653
Okay, I was kind of a wild
girl in high school, too.

00:34:46,653 --> 00:34:48,689
Girl with a
reputation--

00:34:48,689 --> 00:34:50,824
she gets invited
to a lot of parties.

00:34:50,824 --> 00:34:52,426
And sometimes, those parties

00:34:52,426 --> 00:34:54,928
would just be me and
a couple other guys.

00:34:56,363 --> 00:34:57,865
You know what
I'm saying?

00:34:57,865 --> 00:35:00,801
Expectations of my
boyfriend of the weekend

00:35:00,801 --> 00:35:02,402
and those other guys.

00:35:05,272 --> 00:35:07,608
There are eight
girls dead.

00:35:07,608 --> 00:35:09,443
You are so lucky
to be alive.

00:35:09,443 --> 00:35:11,678
ROBINSON: Marla,
you've got three kids.

00:35:11,678 --> 00:35:13,647
What if something
happened to one of them?

00:35:13,647 --> 00:35:15,516
Wouldn't you want the person who
knew the truth to come forward?

00:35:15,516 --> 00:35:16,750
The bastard's dead.

00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:18,519
What difference
does it make now, anyway?

00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:20,787
FINLAY: Somebody helped
him cover it all up.

00:35:20,787 --> 00:35:22,523
Probably the same guy
who killed him.

00:35:22,523 --> 00:35:25,025
And that guy deserves
to be punished.

00:35:31,932 --> 00:35:34,034
Eric doesn't know
about that night.

00:35:35,469 --> 00:35:36,637
I didn't want
to lose him.

00:35:36,637 --> 00:35:37,738
I don't want to lose him.

00:35:37,738 --> 00:35:39,339
This is just the
three of us talking.

00:35:39,339 --> 00:35:40,707
FINLAY: Marla,
you're the only one

00:35:40,707 --> 00:35:42,809
who can speak for
those eight girls.

00:35:47,948 --> 00:35:49,950
You were right,

00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:52,486
about the party.

00:35:52,486 --> 00:35:55,989
It was just me
and three horny boys.

00:35:55,989 --> 00:35:57,991
Max, Gavin...

00:35:57,991 --> 00:35:59,293
Gavin?

00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,495
Gavin Pearson?

00:36:01,495 --> 00:36:03,430
Yeah, the tagalong.

00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:05,432
And Tom Cooley.

00:36:07,467 --> 00:36:08,468
(laughter)

00:36:08,468 --> 00:36:09,770
Cheers.

00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:11,471
MARLA:
<i>Back then, I didn't know</i>

00:36:11,471 --> 00:36:13,507
<i>how to say no.</i>

00:36:13,507 --> 00:36:15,409
<i>You know, I could usually</i>
<i>hold my booze,</i>

00:36:15,409 --> 00:36:16,877
<i>but that night, I blacked out,</i>

00:36:16,877 --> 00:36:19,746
<i>and I woke up</i>
<i>in the bottom of a hole.</i>

00:36:19,746 --> 00:36:20,881
COOLEY:
She's moving.

00:36:20,881 --> 00:36:21,982
<i>Bastards were burying me.</i>

00:36:21,982 --> 00:36:24,785
I didn't tell you to stop!

00:36:27,888 --> 00:36:29,590
What are you doing?

00:36:30,724 --> 00:36:32,426
(gasping)

00:36:32,426 --> 00:36:33,727
Town whore!

00:36:33,727 --> 00:36:35,329
No one's gonna
believe you, anyway!

00:36:35,329 --> 00:36:36,997
He was right.

00:36:36,997 --> 00:36:38,665
The Cooleys owned the town.

00:36:38,665 --> 00:36:40,334
No one would've
believed me.

00:36:40,334 --> 00:36:41,868
And even if they did,

00:36:41,868 --> 00:36:43,870
Tom was untouchable.

00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:45,706
What about
Max and Gavin?

00:36:45,706 --> 00:36:48,342
They never spoke to me again.

00:36:48,342 --> 00:36:50,277
Marla, you should know
that you probably

00:36:50,277 --> 00:36:53,380
did not pass out
just from booze.

00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:55,449
Cooley liked to
roofie his victims.

00:36:58,919 --> 00:37:00,821
Did he rape you?

00:37:04,725 --> 00:37:06,893
SANDERS: <i>We know Cooley was</i>
<i>still alive at 9:40.</i>

00:37:06,893 --> 00:37:08,695
That's when room service

00:37:08,695 --> 00:37:10,831
delivered his second bottle
of scotch.

00:37:10,831 --> 00:37:13,500
Waiter passed Finn in
the hallway as he was leaving,

00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,369
and we picked her up
on hotel surveillance

00:37:15,369 --> 00:37:18,005
as she got back down
the elevator at 9:47.

00:37:18,005 --> 00:37:21,575
Presumably, Cooley was
still breathing.

00:37:21,575 --> 00:37:22,743
What about Pearson?

00:37:22,743 --> 00:37:25,278
He was down at the bar
until 10:18.

00:37:25,278 --> 00:37:27,581
Surveillance picked him up
in the casino,

00:37:27,581 --> 00:37:29,950
clocked him getting
into the elevator at 10:20.

00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:32,919
Pearson then entered
his room at 10:21.

00:37:32,919 --> 00:37:34,855
He called Cooley--
no answer.

00:37:34,855 --> 00:37:36,723
Called him again at 10:24,

00:37:36,723 --> 00:37:38,859
at which point
he called hotel security.

00:37:38,859 --> 00:37:41,962
So Pearson had a window
of three minutes to kill Cooley.

00:37:41,962 --> 00:37:43,830
Takes at least 20 minutes

00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:45,666
for drugs to be absorbed
from the stomach.

00:37:47,467 --> 00:37:50,037
Pearson admitted
he had drinks with Cooley

00:37:50,037 --> 00:37:51,772
up in the room earlier.

00:37:51,772 --> 00:37:55,776
So that gave him access
to the man's scotch

00:37:55,776 --> 00:37:57,978
and his drugs.

00:38:02,582 --> 00:38:05,018
Plenty of time
for them to kick in.

00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,854
Cooley would've been
passed out

00:38:07,854 --> 00:38:09,923
by the time
Pearson came back upstairs.

00:38:09,923 --> 00:38:12,559
So all Pearson had to
do was string him up

00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:15,395
and let gravity do the rest.

00:38:16,463 --> 00:38:18,799
(gasping)

00:38:18,799 --> 00:38:21,835
I'm with you, Sherlock,
but there's only one problem.

00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:24,838
Both doors to the room
were locked.

00:38:24,838 --> 00:38:26,339
From the inside.

00:38:26,339 --> 00:38:30,343
So how did the killer
get out of the room?

00:38:30,343 --> 00:38:32,412
Same way he got in.

00:38:35,615 --> 00:38:38,018
After Cooley's death,

00:38:38,018 --> 00:38:41,021
Pearson's key card
stopped working.

00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:44,458
(door beeps)

00:38:44,458 --> 00:38:45,892
Need a little help here.

00:38:45,892 --> 00:38:47,761
SANDERS:
Is that significant?

00:38:47,761 --> 00:38:49,996
I mean, aren't those things
always getting demagnetized?

00:38:49,996 --> 00:38:52,632
Yeah, you're absolutely right.

00:38:52,632 --> 00:38:54,367
But, Dad,

00:38:54,367 --> 00:38:56,303
the soda machine
stole my dollar.

00:38:56,303 --> 00:38:58,038
That's Vegas, kiddo.
Stick to the table games.

00:39:10,016 --> 00:39:11,685
"Out of order."

00:39:11,685 --> 00:39:15,756
I'm sure you can get a
soda on another floor.

00:39:30,704 --> 00:39:32,272
It's a magnet.

00:39:32,272 --> 00:39:33,640
How'd you know...?

00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,809
Pearson's key card
got demagnetized, right?

00:39:35,809 --> 00:39:37,844
Kid lost his money
in the soda machine.

00:39:37,844 --> 00:39:41,848
Okay, so how does that
help Pearson kill Cooley?

00:39:41,848 --> 00:39:45,285
Pearson got into the room
using this magnet.

00:39:56,496 --> 00:39:57,898
Got out the same way.

00:39:57,898 --> 00:39:59,733
Then he probably

00:39:59,733 --> 00:40:01,301
pocketed the magnet.

00:40:01,301 --> 00:40:03,003
That's when he wiped out
his key card.

00:40:03,003 --> 00:40:05,472
He's a lawyer, so he knows
he can't get caught with it.

00:40:05,472 --> 00:40:07,307
So he sticks it to the
back of the soda machine

00:40:07,307 --> 00:40:08,742
and fries the circuit board.

00:40:08,742 --> 00:40:10,310
Guess we're lucky
he didn't stick it

00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:11,611
behind the ice machine.

00:40:11,611 --> 00:40:13,680
We would never have known.

00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,849
BRASS:
<i>You killed your best friend.</i>

00:40:15,849 --> 00:40:18,752
And your
biggest client.

00:40:18,752 --> 00:40:21,855
Well, you know
how this works.

00:40:21,855 --> 00:40:27,494
If you cooperate,
things can go easier.

00:40:27,494 --> 00:40:29,029
Now, I have
eight victims.

00:40:29,029 --> 00:40:32,332
Four Jane Does.

00:40:35,335 --> 00:40:38,438
I need names.

00:40:44,277 --> 00:40:46,746
Sarah Jones.

00:40:46,746 --> 00:40:50,317
Tiffany Alcott.

00:40:50,317 --> 00:40:53,820
Jennifer Sutterman.

00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,755
Kinley Summer.

00:41:01,995 --> 00:41:05,932
I have met a lot of
people searching for

00:41:05,932 --> 00:41:08,835
missing loved ones over
these past two years.

00:41:08,835 --> 00:41:11,438
Parents who are
willing to do anything

00:41:11,438 --> 00:41:13,006
to bring their
babies home,

00:41:13,006 --> 00:41:15,842
searching
for answers.

00:41:15,842 --> 00:41:17,677
But I was lucky.
I had you.

00:41:17,677 --> 00:41:21,281
And you wanted to find
Janet as badly as I did.

00:41:21,281 --> 00:41:23,984
I only wish that I could have
brought her home to you.

00:41:26,286 --> 00:41:27,354
You did.

00:41:43,904 --> 00:41:45,839
You should feel
good right now.

00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:46,940
Yeah.

00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:51,411
Two years, two jobs,
one marriage.

00:41:52,512 --> 00:41:53,847
But I got him.

00:41:53,847 --> 00:41:55,615
Yeah, most people
would've given up.

00:41:55,615 --> 00:41:59,452
I'm sorry that
I sometimes go too far.

00:41:59,452 --> 00:42:01,855
I'm really working on
that side of my personality.

00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:03,757
(laughs)

00:42:03,757 --> 00:42:05,892
Thanks for sticking by me.

00:42:05,892 --> 00:42:08,828
You're welcome.

00:42:08,828 --> 00:42:11,564
You miss me, don't you?

00:42:13,633 --> 00:42:14,935
Sometimes.

00:42:14,935 --> 00:42:17,704
Sometimes I miss you.

00:42:23,443 --> 00:42:26,313
All right, you ready
to get to the airport?

00:42:26,313 --> 00:42:28,415
There's a flight
in the morning.
