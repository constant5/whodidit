00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:30,731
Now, get back.

00:10:30,731 --> 00:10:32,333
I can't let
you do that.

00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:34,502
Not until I've processed
your clothes, okay?

00:10:34,502 --> 00:10:35,436
VINCENT:
Okay.

00:10:42,777 --> 00:10:44,212
What's all the fuss?

00:10:44,212 --> 00:10:46,080
You look okay to me.

00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,282
And here I thought you weren't
gonna come visit me.

00:10:48,282 --> 00:10:50,117
You got in just under
the wire, mister.

00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:51,853
Yeah, I know.
I'm sorry.
No, that's...

00:10:51,853 --> 00:10:55,556
Barbara and I had to take Maya
and Katie back up to Seattle.

00:10:55,556 --> 00:10:57,358
I took a little time off.

00:10:57,358 --> 00:10:58,459
How you feeling?

00:10:58,459 --> 00:11:01,262
You know...

00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:04,765
Honestly, it hurts.

00:11:04,765 --> 00:11:08,636
I wouldn't recommend
getting shot.

00:11:08,636 --> 00:11:12,473
Although it did get my daughter
to tell me she loves me, so...

00:11:12,473 --> 00:11:13,808
Can't be bad.
Yeah.

00:11:13,808 --> 00:11:16,310
How is your family?

00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:18,479
Better.

00:11:18,479 --> 00:11:19,814
Thank you.

00:11:19,814 --> 00:11:21,482
Barbara's gonna
stay there for a while.

00:11:21,482 --> 00:11:24,218
Help them get settled in.

00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:28,656
(sighs)

00:11:28,656 --> 00:11:30,791
Damn it.
Oh, come on.

00:11:34,295 --> 00:11:36,564
There it is.

00:11:36,564 --> 00:11:38,199
Thanks.
Yeah.

00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:39,433
(sighs)

00:11:39,433 --> 00:11:40,701
Good, you're dressed.

00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:42,503
We got to go.
Hi.

00:11:42,503 --> 00:11:44,238
Honey, look, if you
don't have the time...

00:11:44,238 --> 00:11:45,339
No, I-I want
to take you home.

00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:46,474
I just can't stick around.

00:11:46,474 --> 00:11:48,509
Got a call.
All hands on deck.

00:11:48,509 --> 00:11:50,544
That's the diner?
Mm-hmm.

00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:52,680
Finn told me that
she had that handled.

00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,116
Well, I got "all hands."

00:11:55,116 --> 00:11:57,485
All right.
I better take off.

00:11:57,485 --> 00:11:59,420
I'm happy to see you.

00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,621
Really, thanks for stopping by.

00:12:00,621 --> 00:12:01,856
Yeah.

00:12:01,856 --> 00:12:03,257
See you there.

00:12:08,095 --> 00:12:10,398
Hey.

00:12:10,398 --> 00:12:12,233
You're not supposed
to be working, remember?

00:12:12,233 --> 00:12:14,735
No, you're right.

00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:16,170
Hmm.

00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,271
I'm gonna get a nurse.

00:12:17,271 --> 00:12:19,307
Get you out of here.

00:12:25,846 --> 00:12:28,215
Yeah, it's Ecklie.
Get me the sheriff.

00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:32,853
You know, I appreciate you
having my back,

00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:35,756
but I think you might
have misrepresented

00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:37,825
the situation
just a little bit.

00:12:37,825 --> 00:12:39,193
Yeah, in what way?

00:12:39,193 --> 00:12:40,594
Pretty sure that I said

00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:42,630
that it was something
that I could handle.

00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:47,101
I think your exact words were,
"It's nothing to worry about."

00:12:47,101 --> 00:12:48,469
Oh, and are you worried?

00:12:48,469 --> 00:12:49,470
Yeah, a little bit.

00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:51,205
You look stumped.

00:12:51,205 --> 00:12:52,606
I'm not stumped.

00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:53,808
I'm thinking.

00:12:53,808 --> 00:12:55,609
I've released
the other bodies,

00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:57,745
but there's something odd
about these three.

00:12:57,745 --> 00:12:59,380
I'm going with stumped.

00:13:00,414 --> 00:13:03,617
Thinking.

00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:06,354
Look at the blood
on this guy's chin.

00:13:06,354 --> 00:13:09,156
Unless gravity's been altered,
it's going the wrong way.

00:13:09,156 --> 00:13:11,359
RUSSELL:
Yeah, you're right.

00:13:11,359 --> 00:13:13,427
This guy's lying down now,
but he had to be upright

00:13:13,427 --> 00:13:14,662
when he was shot.
Mm-hmm.

00:13:14,662 --> 00:13:17,531
And over here,
on this guy...

00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:21,502
There's no exit wound,
and yet,

00:13:21,502 --> 00:13:22,770
his back is all bloody.

00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:25,239
Which means he was
laying down, not sitting.

00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:26,474
Where's her wound?

00:13:30,344 --> 00:13:33,447
(sighs)
On the right.

00:13:33,447 --> 00:13:37,718
How was she shot on the right
while she was sitting here?

00:13:37,718 --> 00:13:40,254
She wasn't.

00:13:40,254 --> 00:13:45,126
Someone moved all three of these
bodies after they were shot.

00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:52,733
Hey.
Hi.

00:13:52,733 --> 00:13:54,368
BRODY:
Whoa.

00:13:54,368 --> 00:13:55,603
They had a camera
in the walk-in?

00:13:55,603 --> 00:13:57,304
Yeah, Vincent said

00:13:57,304 --> 00:14:00,307
someone was pilfering steak
and lobster a while back.

00:14:00,307 --> 00:14:02,777
How long was
Vincent in there?

00:14:02,777 --> 00:14:04,545
Well, the camera's
motion-activated,

00:14:04,545 --> 00:14:07,548
and there's no time code,
so I checked cell records

00:14:07,548 --> 00:14:09,383
from the first time
he dialed his brother

00:14:09,383 --> 00:14:10,851
until the cops let him out.

00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:12,253
Under seven minutes.

00:14:12,253 --> 00:14:14,422
You buy he got
locked in there?

00:14:14,422 --> 00:14:17,391
It happens easier
than you'd think.

00:14:17,391 --> 00:14:18,692
Not interrupting.

00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:20,428
I just, uh... I wanted

00:14:20,428 --> 00:14:22,563
to find out about,
uh, your father.

00:14:22,563 --> 00:14:24,398
Uh, he's getting out
of the hospital today,

00:14:24,398 --> 00:14:26,801
and I wanted to see
how that all went.

00:14:26,801 --> 00:14:28,769
It was... fine.

00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:30,371
Thank you for asking, though.

00:14:30,371 --> 00:14:32,740
Yeah, it's, uh,
no trouble at all.

00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,075
Uh, to ask,

00:14:34,075 --> 00:14:35,109
I mean.

00:14:37,478 --> 00:14:39,847
Uh, yeah, I'm-I'm...
I'm gonna go.

00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,485
(Sanders scoffs)

00:14:44,485 --> 00:14:45,719
Did he seem weird to you?

00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:48,122
I mean, weirder than usual.

00:14:48,122 --> 00:14:51,125
No, not at all.

00:14:52,493 --> 00:14:54,195
I got three more in the hallway.

00:14:54,195 --> 00:14:56,330
Well, I can always
use the overtime.

00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:58,699
Why don't you, uh, prep
this young lady?

00:14:58,699 --> 00:15:01,102
I'm almost done
with Dahlia.
Yeah.

00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:12,847
Can I help you?

00:15:12,847 --> 00:15:15,416
I'm looking for a loved
one who was brought in.

00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:16,617
Edie Graham.

00:15:19,854 --> 00:15:21,555
Reception let you
come back here?

00:15:21,555 --> 00:15:23,757
I might have given them
the impression

00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:25,226
I worked for the mortuary.

00:15:25,226 --> 00:15:26,227
ROBBINS:
So, you're

00:15:26,227 --> 00:15:27,695
the next of kin?

00:15:27,695 --> 00:15:29,663
I'm the closest
thing Edie's got.

00:15:29,663 --> 00:15:31,198
We were gonna be married.

00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:34,201
I see, Mr...

00:15:34,201 --> 00:15:36,337
Basderic.

00:15:36,337 --> 00:15:38,205
David,

00:15:38,205 --> 00:15:40,107
call Sara.

00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:43,644
Tell her to bring down
Edie's paperwork right away

00:15:43,644 --> 00:15:45,479
for Mr. Basderic.

00:15:45,479 --> 00:15:47,414
Right.

00:16:03,864 --> 00:16:06,100
(chuckles)

00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,068
We met at the diner
where she worked.

00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:10,371
I went in there a lot.

00:16:10,371 --> 00:16:14,308
She was always so good to me.

00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:16,710
So warm.

00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:17,645
I just knew.

00:16:19,413 --> 00:16:23,484
And I could see in her
eyes... she felt it, too.

00:16:23,484 --> 00:16:25,286
I'm sorry for your loss.

00:16:33,427 --> 00:16:35,563
Right there.

00:16:35,563 --> 00:16:37,364
I can't allow you to touch her.

00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:52,479
I'd like to put the
ring on her finger.

00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:55,316
No, I'm sorry.

00:16:56,717 --> 00:16:59,420
That's him.
That's Basderic.

00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,562
Hello, Ronald.

00:17:13,467 --> 00:17:14,668
It's a match.

00:17:17,171 --> 00:17:18,572
You're done,
you son of a bitch.

00:17:28,449 --> 00:17:29,783
Where are my clothes?

00:17:29,783 --> 00:17:30,784
I want my clothes.

00:17:30,784 --> 00:17:32,519
That prison
jumpsuit

00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:34,421
is the only clothes
you need to worry about now.

00:17:34,421 --> 00:17:36,757
When you return them,
I expect them to be

00:17:36,757 --> 00:17:39,260
in the condition
in which you received them.

00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,561
I'm very particular.

00:17:40,561 --> 00:17:42,863
SIDLE:
We have you
in the diner, Ronald.

00:17:42,863 --> 00:17:44,198
You stepped in Edie's blood.

00:17:47,201 --> 00:17:48,569
I went in to check on her.

00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:50,204
Cops saw you stalking
her from outside

00:17:50,204 --> 00:17:51,472
right before the shooting.

00:17:51,472 --> 00:17:53,474
I wasn't stalking;
I was observing.

00:17:53,474 --> 00:17:54,508
You were there.

00:17:54,508 --> 00:17:55,743
Yes.

00:17:55,743 --> 00:17:57,645
But I knew the officers
would harass me,

00:17:57,645 --> 00:17:59,446
so I took a walk
around the block.

00:17:59,446 --> 00:18:01,448
When I got back,
I could tell

00:18:01,448 --> 00:18:02,850
something was wrong.

00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:05,486
That's when I went inside.

00:18:07,488 --> 00:18:09,156
She was already dead.

00:18:09,156 --> 00:18:10,557
Why didn't you call 911?

00:18:10,557 --> 00:18:12,760
Because she was already dead.

00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,428
BRASS:
Okay, you didn't do it,

00:18:14,428 --> 00:18:16,397
so you must have seen who did.

00:18:16,397 --> 00:18:19,433
I told you, I went for
a walk around the block.

00:18:21,635 --> 00:18:25,472
If I knew who killed Edie,
I would tell you.

00:18:25,472 --> 00:18:27,374
They took her from me.

00:18:27,374 --> 00:18:29,843
She was mine.

00:18:31,512 --> 00:18:33,180
Do you own a gun, Ronald?

00:18:34,415 --> 00:18:36,150
I would never.
I hate guns.

00:18:38,652 --> 00:18:40,120
Open your mouth.

00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,690
No.

00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:44,191
You can't make me.

00:18:44,191 --> 00:18:45,459
Not without my consent.

00:18:45,459 --> 00:18:46,794
I can get a court order.

00:18:46,794 --> 00:18:49,396
Good luck with that.

00:18:49,396 --> 00:18:51,298
I can't imagine too many judges

00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:53,801
being receptive
to your requests.

00:18:53,801 --> 00:18:56,704
What with your
corruption scandal and all.

00:19:04,178 --> 00:19:06,847
Three bodies all
moved after the fact.

00:19:06,847 --> 00:19:09,116
Why were they moved,
and who moved them?

00:19:09,116 --> 00:19:10,484
Do we know who they are?

00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:12,386
STOKES:
Yeah, this is Connie.

00:19:12,386 --> 00:19:14,121
She was a regular
at the diner.

00:19:14,121 --> 00:19:16,190
A bus driver who drove
the 5:00 a.m. shift

00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,558
so that she
could be at home

00:19:17,558 --> 00:19:19,159
with her grandkids
in the afternoon.

00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:21,562
Their mom's a
blackjack dealer.

00:19:21,562 --> 00:19:23,530
This one I don't know.

00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:25,532
Who is this, Super Dave?

00:19:25,532 --> 00:19:28,268
Oh, I found an Arizona
driver's license.

00:19:28,268 --> 00:19:29,837
Robert Rios.

00:19:29,837 --> 00:19:32,439
I ran him through
mobile AFIS.

00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:33,507
There's no criminal history.

00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:37,711
And this guy,

00:19:37,711 --> 00:19:39,446
Alex Brenner.

00:19:39,446 --> 00:19:40,581
Local address.

00:19:40,581 --> 00:19:42,316
Look at that,
brand-new license.

00:19:42,316 --> 00:19:43,751
Mint condition.

00:19:43,751 --> 00:19:45,386
PHILLIPS:
I'm running his prints now.

00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:54,361
Access blocked.

00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:56,230
I have a feeling our
friend Alex Brenner here

00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,765
isn't Alex Brenner.

00:19:57,765 --> 00:19:59,500
BRASS: <i>Sheriff, I'm aware</i>
<i>of the pressure</i>

00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,569
that you're getting
from the press on this case.

00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:04,571
No, I know, I get it, I get it.

00:20:04,571 --> 00:20:06,340
No, I don't disagree.

00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,841
No, especially in light

00:20:07,841 --> 00:20:09,777
of what's going on
in the department.

00:20:09,777 --> 00:20:12,179
But I have a feeling that
the answer you're looking for

00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:13,647
is staring at me
right now in my office.

00:20:13,647 --> 00:20:14,782
I'll get back to you.

00:20:14,782 --> 00:20:16,250
Captain.

00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,185
Karen Taylor,
Deputy U.S. Marshal.

00:20:18,185 --> 00:20:19,520
Your department
ran fingerprints

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,821
on someone we have
an interest in.

00:20:20,821 --> 00:20:22,489
Let me guess: Alex Brenner.

00:20:22,489 --> 00:20:24,625
That's what you Feds
are calling him, right?

00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,493
And since it's
U.S. Marshals in my office

00:20:26,493 --> 00:20:28,796
and not FBI, I'm guessing he
was in Witness Protection.

00:20:28,796 --> 00:20:30,197
So, who is he really?

00:20:30,197 --> 00:20:31,465
Obviously, I can't
tell you that.

00:20:31,465 --> 00:20:32,833
Who are you protecting him from?

00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:34,868
I can't tell you
that, either.
Miss Taylor,

00:20:34,868 --> 00:20:36,570
you dropped this guy
in my jurisdiction

00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:38,705
without even bothering
to call the department.

00:20:38,705 --> 00:20:40,641
Now he's one of eight victims

00:20:40,641 --> 00:20:43,477
in a multiple homicide that
just so happened to have killed

00:20:43,477 --> 00:20:45,512
several of my friends.

00:20:45,512 --> 00:20:47,514
Now, you got about two
seconds to tell me something

00:20:47,514 --> 00:20:49,116
or I'll have you
thrown out of here.

00:20:50,651 --> 00:20:53,287
Alex Brenner testified
against some really bad people

00:20:53,287 --> 00:20:54,588
about four months ago.

00:20:54,588 --> 00:20:57,491
We dropped him
in Las Vegas just last week.

00:20:57,491 --> 00:21:01,495
As for our failure
to notify LVPD, frankly,

00:21:01,495 --> 00:21:03,430
we didn't know
if you could be trusted.

00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,766
(sighs)
Okay.

00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:07,801
So, these "bad people,"

00:21:07,801 --> 00:21:10,237
are they the kind that would
sacrifice seven innocent lives

00:21:10,237 --> 00:21:11,605
just to get the
one they want?

00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:13,307
I believe so.

00:21:13,307 --> 00:21:15,075
Yes.

00:21:21,415 --> 00:21:22,416
Pretty intense look

00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:24,117
you have
going on there.

00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:26,553
What are you
searching for?

00:21:26,553 --> 00:21:28,155
Edie's stalker, Basderic.

00:21:28,155 --> 00:21:30,224
He knows the law.

00:21:30,224 --> 00:21:32,326
Up until last night, he
has known exactly how far

00:21:32,326 --> 00:21:33,760
he could go without
crossing the line.

00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,795
Okay.

00:21:34,795 --> 00:21:36,296
But the guy is sick.

00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:37,731
Edie couldn't
have been his first.

00:21:37,731 --> 00:21:39,833
He-he must've screwed up
somewhere before.

00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:42,603
I just haven't been
able to find it.

00:21:42,603 --> 00:21:44,471
Well, have you tried
searching court records

00:21:44,471 --> 00:21:47,441
for other TROs
or denied apps?

00:21:47,441 --> 00:21:48,542
Yeah, I did that.

00:21:48,542 --> 00:21:50,110
I'm on criminal records now.

00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,612
Ok, well, how about I take

00:21:51,612 --> 00:21:53,080
civil court.

00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,648
Basderic's not a common name.

00:21:54,648 --> 00:21:56,717
Well, you never know.

00:21:56,717 --> 00:21:58,719
Oh, here's something.
Apparently,

00:21:58,719 --> 00:22:00,654
Basderic was involved
in a lawsuit.

00:22:00,654 --> 00:22:02,523
Who sued him?

00:22:02,523 --> 00:22:04,324
Actually, he was the plaintiff.

00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:06,460
He sued for damages
after some guy assaulted him.

00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,095
Well, what do
you want to bet

00:22:08,095 --> 00:22:10,564
that the guy was the boyfriend
or the husband

00:22:10,564 --> 00:22:12,499
of some poor woman
that Basderic was stalking?

00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:15,235
Well, the judge sided
with Basderic

00:22:15,235 --> 00:22:18,405
and awarded him
almost $200,000.

00:22:18,405 --> 00:22:20,240
I hate this guy.

00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,576
I hate the way he works the law.

00:22:22,576 --> 00:22:25,612
Well, this probably won't ease
your blood pressure any,

00:22:25,612 --> 00:22:28,482
but during the assault,

00:22:28,482 --> 00:22:30,484
Basderic actually
shot the guy.

00:22:30,484 --> 00:22:32,653
He shot his attacker?

00:22:32,653 --> 00:22:34,288
Legally, it was
self-defense.

00:22:34,288 --> 00:22:36,356
Point is...

00:22:36,356 --> 00:22:38,425
he had a gun.

00:22:38,425 --> 00:22:41,495
Hey, Doc.
Hey.

00:22:41,495 --> 00:22:43,864
We need to take a long,
hard look at Alex Brenner.

00:22:43,864 --> 00:22:45,632
You care to elaborate?

00:22:45,632 --> 00:22:48,802
Well, he was in the
Witness Protection Program.

00:22:48,802 --> 00:22:50,370
We're thinking maybe that's
what got him killed.

00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:51,738
Along with everybody
else in the diner.

00:22:51,738 --> 00:22:53,373
What can you tell us
about where he's been?

00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:55,709
Well, there are some things
that suggest his history.

00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:57,177
Dental work, certainly.

00:22:57,177 --> 00:22:58,579
I don't think it
was done in the U.S.

00:22:58,579 --> 00:23:00,747
Mexico, maybe.
Hmm.

00:23:00,747 --> 00:23:01,682
What else?

00:23:01,682 --> 00:23:03,450
He was suffering from talcosis.

00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:05,519
I found talc granulomas
in his lungs.

00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:07,387
Talc?
Yeah, it's a condition

00:23:07,387 --> 00:23:09,523
usually associated
with drug use.

00:23:09,523 --> 00:23:13,327
People inject talc-diluted
heroin or cocaine.

00:23:13,327 --> 00:23:15,495
But there's no evidence
that he was a drug user.

00:23:15,495 --> 00:23:18,198
So how did the talc get
into his body?
Probably inhaled.

00:23:18,198 --> 00:23:20,133
I'm thinking that he
spent a lot of time

00:23:20,133 --> 00:23:23,103
in an environment where talc
was used, breathed it in.

00:23:23,103 --> 00:23:24,471
Yeah, drug environment.

00:23:24,471 --> 00:23:27,774
If he was cutting heroin
and cocaine with talc.

00:23:27,774 --> 00:23:29,376
It's not an
unreasonable inference.

00:23:29,376 --> 00:23:31,111
Stomach content was waffles.

00:23:31,111 --> 00:23:32,479
Is that significant?

00:23:32,479 --> 00:23:34,548
If he ate waffles,
that puts him

00:23:34,548 --> 00:23:37,284
in the corner booth
where we found Rios.

00:23:39,486 --> 00:23:41,755
What did Rios eat?

00:23:46,827 --> 00:23:48,261
Hmm.

00:23:48,261 --> 00:23:51,131
His stomach
was filled with pizza.

00:23:51,131 --> 00:23:54,401
Frank's Diner
doesn't serve pizza.

00:23:54,401 --> 00:23:56,269
Maybe he wasn't there to eat.

00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:58,205
Okay, what more can you tell us
about Rios?

00:23:58,205 --> 00:24:00,841
I found fibers in his
upper trachea and esophagus

00:24:00,841 --> 00:24:02,476
as well as his mouth.

00:24:02,476 --> 00:24:03,710
I gave them to Hodges,

00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,178
but he hasn't
tested them yet.

00:24:05,178 --> 00:24:06,647
Until a minute ago,

00:24:06,647 --> 00:24:08,515
Mr. Rios here was on
the back burner.

00:24:08,515 --> 00:24:10,183
He's on the front burner now.

00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,789
HODGES: The pizza would
have raised a red flag

00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:17,658
had I known that the
diner didn't serve pizza,

00:24:17,658 --> 00:24:19,259
but I didn't know

00:24:19,259 --> 00:24:20,661
that the diner
didn't serve pizza.

00:24:20,661 --> 00:24:22,729
You care to guess why?

00:24:22,729 --> 00:24:26,533
Because no one ever includes me
whenever they go to the diner.

00:24:27,834 --> 00:24:29,202
Positive for lead.

00:24:30,704 --> 00:24:32,105
What about the fiber?

00:24:34,708 --> 00:24:36,743
It's a microfiber.

00:24:36,743 --> 00:24:40,213
Polyethylene terephthalate
to be more precise.

00:24:40,213 --> 00:24:42,683
More commonly known
as polar fleece.

00:24:42,683 --> 00:24:44,184
Like a jacket.

00:24:44,184 --> 00:24:47,854
Or, considering
that he inhaled it,

00:24:47,854 --> 00:24:51,358
I think Rios
was wearing a ski mask.

00:24:56,496 --> 00:24:58,298
The belt tested positive
for lead.

00:24:58,298 --> 00:24:59,566
Tells me he had a gun.

00:24:59,566 --> 00:25:01,101
And a mask.

00:25:01,101 --> 00:25:04,838
Robert Rios was not a victim.

00:25:04,838 --> 00:25:07,274
He was the shooter.

00:25:11,578 --> 00:25:14,281
STOKES: <i>Robert Rios</i>
<i>had an Arizona license.</i>

00:25:14,281 --> 00:25:17,117
PD's there checking
into him now.

00:25:17,117 --> 00:25:18,418
I guess the
bigger question is,

00:25:18,418 --> 00:25:20,387
if Rios is our shooter,
who shot Rios?

00:25:20,387 --> 00:25:22,155
Probably whoever
hired him.

00:25:22,155 --> 00:25:24,691
Could be the cartel if they
were after Alex Brenner.

00:25:24,691 --> 00:25:26,426
You know, once the
dirty work's done,

00:25:26,426 --> 00:25:30,430
you bring somebody in;
a cleaner.

00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:32,299
Kill Rios, take his gun,
move the bodies.

00:25:32,299 --> 00:25:33,600
Okay, you know what?

00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,402
Let's not wait
for the cops in Arizona.

00:25:35,402 --> 00:25:37,471
Dig into Rios.
Get whatever you can, okay?

00:25:37,471 --> 00:25:39,172
All right, I'm on it.

00:25:45,112 --> 00:25:47,180
All right, I'm here.
What's the issue?

00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:51,184
I ran ballistics on all
15 rounds that were fired.

00:25:51,184 --> 00:25:53,787
Turns out five of them
were from a second gun.

00:25:53,787 --> 00:25:55,155
Well, that's consistent
with the idea

00:25:55,155 --> 00:25:56,723
of a cleaner, right?
We know

00:25:56,723 --> 00:25:58,725
at least two of the shots
were the ones that killed Rios.

00:25:58,725 --> 00:26:00,293
And we've got
the point-blank

00:26:00,293 --> 00:26:01,862
on the waitress, Edie.

00:26:01,862 --> 00:26:03,630
Then I've got two misses.

00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:05,465
Misses?

00:26:05,465 --> 00:26:08,301
Wouldn't have thought
a cleaner would be sloppy.

00:26:08,301 --> 00:26:10,570
That's not all. Check this out.

00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:13,173
The red laser is a miss
from Rios's gun.

00:26:13,173 --> 00:26:14,608
The green is the cleaner's.

00:26:18,545 --> 00:26:20,180
Two different guns,

00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:22,249
both fired
from the same place.

00:26:22,249 --> 00:26:23,784
Doesn't make any sense.

00:26:23,784 --> 00:26:25,485
Yeah.

00:26:25,485 --> 00:26:27,788
Is that can where it was
when you found it?

00:26:27,788 --> 00:26:29,756
No, it was on the floor.
I replaced it.

00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:32,092
But there was oil residue
on the counter,

00:26:32,092 --> 00:26:34,394
so I knew where
to put it.

00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:38,298
Let me try something here.

00:26:38,298 --> 00:26:40,300
Excuse me a sec.

00:26:42,135 --> 00:26:44,538
Square peg in a square hole.

00:26:48,208 --> 00:26:51,645
Shots came from there.
Alex Brenner had the second gun.

00:26:51,645 --> 00:26:53,613
It fits with everything
we know about him.

00:26:53,613 --> 00:26:55,348
He was in
Witness Protection.

00:26:55,348 --> 00:26:58,385
He was fearing for his life,
so he was carrying.

00:26:58,385 --> 00:27:01,421
Call Finn. Get her down here.
I want to run this thing.

00:27:02,756 --> 00:27:04,691
Okay, I'm Rios.
I'm the shooter.

00:27:04,691 --> 00:27:06,393
Where do we start?

00:27:06,393 --> 00:27:07,494
Okay, first event
happens here.

00:27:07,494 --> 00:27:09,396
Owen and the shooter
struggle,

00:27:09,396 --> 00:27:11,431
and fight for control
of the gun.

00:27:16,102 --> 00:27:19,206
<i>The gun discharges,</i>
<i>severing Owen's finger.</i>

00:27:24,277 --> 00:27:25,846
FINLAY: Okay,
and then at some point

00:27:25,846 --> 00:27:27,514
during the struggle,

00:27:27,514 --> 00:27:29,683
Dahlia gets up off of her stool,
and comes over

00:27:29,683 --> 00:27:30,717
and tries to help.

00:27:33,186 --> 00:27:35,689
<i>First shot misses,</i>
<i>hits the chocolate milk shake,</i>

00:27:35,689 --> 00:27:39,693
<i>and the next two</i>
<i>take Dahlia down.</i>

00:27:39,693 --> 00:27:42,863
Now, I just shot two people
pretty quickly.

00:27:42,863 --> 00:27:44,431
If I'm robbing the place,

00:27:44,431 --> 00:27:46,299
why don't I just
turn around and leave?

00:27:46,299 --> 00:27:47,734
Why do I keep killing?

00:27:47,734 --> 00:27:49,469
Well, we know that you
were wearing a mask.

00:27:49,469 --> 00:27:51,671
Maybe it came off
during the struggle.

00:27:51,671 --> 00:27:53,306
So I'm eliminating witnesses.

00:27:53,306 --> 00:27:56,142
Or you haven't hit
your target yet.

00:27:58,378 --> 00:28:00,614
So the waitress is next?

00:28:00,614 --> 00:28:03,416
FINLAY:
<i>Shot goes through the coffee</i>
<i>pot, and then into her chest.</i>

00:28:03,416 --> 00:28:05,652
What about the coup de grâce?

00:28:05,652 --> 00:28:08,388
Well, given that Edie crawled,
that actually comes later.

00:28:08,388 --> 00:28:11,191
The old couple comes next.

00:28:11,191 --> 00:28:13,526
They are sitting targets,
literally.

00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:17,130
<i>He tries to shield her,</i>
<i>he gets the first shot,</i>

00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:18,531
<i>and she gets the second.</i>

00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:21,334
That leaves
just two more targets:

00:28:21,334 --> 00:28:24,304
Alex and the bus driver Connie.

00:28:24,304 --> 00:28:26,640
Yeah, she goes first,
running towards the restrooms,

00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,808
<i>probably trying to escape.</i>

00:28:28,808 --> 00:28:32,646
<i>Shot catches her in the side,</i>
<i>just below her armpit.</i>

00:28:32,646 --> 00:28:34,214
That leaves Alex,

00:28:34,214 --> 00:28:35,715
and he just saw me
shoot six people.

00:28:35,715 --> 00:28:37,717
And we now know
he has a gun.

00:28:37,717 --> 00:28:39,286
And he knows
that I'm coming for him.

00:28:39,286 --> 00:28:41,755
<i>So he tries to defend himself.</i>

00:28:41,755 --> 00:28:45,091
<i>Both shots miss</i>
<i>and hit the olive oil can.</i>

00:28:45,091 --> 00:28:47,661
<i>And I put two into him.</i>

00:28:47,661 --> 00:28:48,862
SIDLE:
<i>As far as Rios goes,</i>

00:28:48,862 --> 00:28:50,297
that's the end
of the shooting.

00:28:50,297 --> 00:28:51,598
Time for the cleaner.

00:28:51,598 --> 00:28:53,500
Say that's me.

00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,569
Vincent said that they kept the
back door open to let air in,

00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:58,438
so I could have come
from back here.

00:28:58,438 --> 00:29:01,474
And I, Rios, know you,
so I don't shoot.

00:29:01,474 --> 00:29:02,742
But I do something

00:29:02,742 --> 00:29:05,578
that you are
definitely not expecting.

00:29:05,578 --> 00:29:08,248
I pick up Alex's gun,

00:29:08,248 --> 00:29:09,683
<i>and I shoot you.</i>

00:29:11,484 --> 00:29:14,287
Which leaves one final shot:
the coup de grâce

00:29:14,287 --> 00:29:16,289
to Edie's head.

00:29:16,289 --> 00:29:18,258
So Edie crawls out
from behind the counter.

00:29:18,258 --> 00:29:20,160
I realize she's alive.

00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,695
<i>She's just seen me shoot Rios.</i>

00:29:21,695 --> 00:29:24,097
<i>I go up to her and...</i>

00:29:24,097 --> 00:29:26,566
final shot.
So the theory is

00:29:26,566 --> 00:29:28,635
Alex was the target.
Wait a minute.

00:29:28,635 --> 00:29:31,771
It still doesn't explain
Edie's stalker, Basderic.

00:29:31,771 --> 00:29:33,239
We know he
was here.

00:29:33,239 --> 00:29:34,774
He left shoe impressions
right there.

00:29:34,774 --> 00:29:36,376
So are you thinking

00:29:36,376 --> 00:29:38,111
that Basderic put the kill shot
into Edie?

00:29:38,111 --> 00:29:39,245
He felt rebuffed by her.

00:29:39,245 --> 00:29:40,613
We know he's gone off before.

00:29:40,613 --> 00:29:42,716
He lied about
never having had a gun.

00:29:42,716 --> 00:29:44,384
(phone rings)
Hold on a sec.

00:29:44,384 --> 00:29:46,219
Hey, Nick.

00:29:46,219 --> 00:29:48,388
Yeah, just got access to
Robert Rios's banking records.

00:29:48,388 --> 00:29:49,856
Somebody we know

00:29:49,856 --> 00:29:52,158
has been writing him
some big checks.
Who?

00:29:52,158 --> 00:29:54,728
His ex-girlfriend.

00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:58,631
BRASS:
You know, Mrs. DeMarcus,

00:29:58,631 --> 00:30:00,233
this must be a
complicated time.

00:30:00,233 --> 00:30:01,534
I mean, who
do you mourn?

00:30:01,534 --> 00:30:03,770
Your dead husband

00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:06,339
or the other guy
you were involved with?

00:30:06,339 --> 00:30:09,309
There was nothing going on
between me and Robert.

00:30:09,309 --> 00:30:11,745
Well, not anymore.
So you didn't pay him
to kill your husband?

00:30:11,745 --> 00:30:13,413
Why would you think that?

00:30:13,413 --> 00:30:14,848
You gave him $6,000
last month.

00:30:14,848 --> 00:30:18,151
$5,000 the month before.

00:30:18,151 --> 00:30:19,586
$10,000 the month
before that.

00:30:19,586 --> 00:30:22,389
I help Robert out.
I have for a long time.

00:30:23,556 --> 00:30:25,492
He had a gambling problem.

00:30:25,492 --> 00:30:26,860
He owed people money.

00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:29,195
I didn't want
to see him hurt.
Mmm.

00:30:29,195 --> 00:30:30,764
Why on earth
would I want Owen dead?

00:30:30,764 --> 00:30:32,232
I don't know.

00:30:32,232 --> 00:30:33,600
Maybe your marriage
was in trouble.

00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,136
Our marriage wasn't in trouble.

00:30:38,538 --> 00:30:40,774
Owen and I were fine.

00:30:40,774 --> 00:30:44,511
Owen didn't love the fact
that she kept bailing out Rios,

00:30:44,511 --> 00:30:48,415
but it was her money.

00:30:48,415 --> 00:30:51,384
That's what you get
for marrying a rich girl.

00:30:51,384 --> 00:30:53,553
STOKES:
Did you ever hear them
fight about it?

00:30:53,553 --> 00:30:55,588
Sure, but they fought
all the time.

00:30:55,588 --> 00:30:57,090
That was part of the attraction.

00:30:57,090 --> 00:30:58,858
That kind of passion
can turn bad.

00:30:58,858 --> 00:31:00,693
Believe me,
I've seen it happen.

00:31:00,693 --> 00:31:03,463
Not them.
I-I-I'm telling you,

00:31:03,463 --> 00:31:05,432
things were going well.

00:31:05,432 --> 00:31:06,699
Even the money thing.

00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:08,501
What do you mean by that?

00:31:08,501 --> 00:31:11,805
Owen and I were working a deal
with the Mediterranean.

00:31:11,805 --> 00:31:14,741
They want to put
a Frank's Diner in the casino.

00:31:14,741 --> 00:31:17,777
Owen was about to have
plenty of money of his own.

00:31:17,777 --> 00:31:19,546
Both of us.

00:31:21,247 --> 00:31:23,583
Trust me, Nick.

00:31:23,583 --> 00:31:26,386
There's no way Sheila is the
one who's behind what happened.

00:31:26,386 --> 00:31:28,788
(over radio): All units,
possible 413, shots fired.

00:31:28,788 --> 00:31:30,390
Corner of Dermott and Westfall.

00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:32,392
Corner of Dermott and Westfall.
Repeat...

00:31:32,392 --> 00:31:33,860
That's the diner.

00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,395
What's going on?

00:31:35,395 --> 00:31:37,764
Uh, not sure.
Shots fired at the diner.

00:31:37,764 --> 00:31:41,267
No, stay here, Vincent.
We'll handle it.

00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:45,138
Coming through.

00:31:45,138 --> 00:31:46,406
Coming through.
What's up?

00:31:46,406 --> 00:31:48,274
OFFICER MITCHELL:
Nick, relax, man.

00:31:48,274 --> 00:31:50,076
What's up?
Code four.

00:31:50,076 --> 00:31:51,578
Accidental discharge.

00:31:51,578 --> 00:31:53,680
Newspaper guy.

00:31:56,116 --> 00:31:58,251
STOKES:
What's he doing out of bed?

00:32:01,321 --> 00:32:04,090
Hey, Ecklie.

00:32:05,325 --> 00:32:07,093
Didn't you get shot?

00:32:07,093 --> 00:32:08,528
Come on, man,
you know the drill.

00:32:08,528 --> 00:32:10,730
You got to give yourself
some time to heal here.

00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:13,766
Thanks for the advice, Nick.
Here's the gun.

00:32:15,268 --> 00:32:16,703
Nine-millimeter?

00:32:16,703 --> 00:32:18,805
That's the same caliber
as the diner.
Yep.

00:32:18,805 --> 00:32:20,773
Guy was refilling
the newspaper machines.

00:32:20,773 --> 00:32:23,143
He took the day-old papers out,
was stacking them

00:32:23,143 --> 00:32:25,545
in his truck for recycling
when the gun fell out.

00:32:25,545 --> 00:32:27,447
He picked it up.
It discharged.

00:32:27,447 --> 00:32:29,649
Where's the second one?

00:32:31,417 --> 00:32:34,587
We know there
were two guns.

00:32:37,624 --> 00:32:39,492
(sighs)

00:32:45,532 --> 00:32:47,867
Here we go.

00:32:47,867 --> 00:32:50,236
This one's a little bit thicker
than the others.

00:32:54,107 --> 00:32:55,842
There she is.

00:32:55,842 --> 00:32:58,344
The second gun.

00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:03,616
Both of these guns
have been wiped clean.

00:33:03,616 --> 00:33:05,185
Same with the shells.

00:33:05,185 --> 00:33:06,386
There's nothing on them.

00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,389
SIDLE:
But the ninhydrins brought up

00:33:09,389 --> 00:33:10,823
some useful prints on the paper.

00:33:13,326 --> 00:33:15,195
Okay.

00:33:15,195 --> 00:33:18,865
It sounds to me
like after the shooting,

00:33:18,865 --> 00:33:22,168
our guy leaves the diner looking
to dump the guns somewhere

00:33:22,168 --> 00:33:23,570
and sees the newspaper machine.

00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:25,238
<i>For a buck in quarters,</i>
<i>he's found</i>

00:33:25,238 --> 00:33:26,706
<i>a pretty good place</i>
<i>to hide them.</i>

00:33:26,706 --> 00:33:28,474
It's already Monday--
it's unlikely

00:33:28,474 --> 00:33:30,343
that anybody's going to
buy the Sunday paper,

00:33:30,343 --> 00:33:33,813
so the guns stay put until the
delivery guy hauls them away.

00:33:33,813 --> 00:33:35,215
Mm-hmm.

00:33:36,816 --> 00:33:38,251
We got a match.

00:33:38,251 --> 00:33:40,620
Ronald Basderic.

00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:50,296
BRASS:
How'd you meet Rios?

00:33:50,296 --> 00:33:52,098
Gamblers Anonymous?

00:33:52,098 --> 00:33:53,833
Some twisted chat room?

00:33:53,833 --> 00:33:55,501
I don't know
what you're talking about.

00:33:55,501 --> 00:33:57,203
I don't know any Rios.

00:33:57,203 --> 00:33:58,838
Listen, Ronald, we're
just trying to give you

00:33:58,838 --> 00:34:00,306
a chance to
explain yourself.

00:34:00,306 --> 00:34:01,574
Your fingerprints
are on the paper.

00:34:01,574 --> 00:34:03,509
The gun was inside.

00:34:03,509 --> 00:34:04,777
Your footprints
are in the diner.

00:34:04,777 --> 00:34:06,746
You are never
going to see

00:34:06,746 --> 00:34:08,381
the light of
day again.

00:34:13,253 --> 00:34:15,555
BRASS:
Hey.

00:34:15,555 --> 00:34:17,390
Don't touch the evidence.

00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:20,326
Can you just fix that?

00:34:28,334 --> 00:34:31,237
That newspaper machine
is on public property.

00:34:31,237 --> 00:34:33,539
I can legally be there.

00:34:33,539 --> 00:34:35,341
I can watch Edie from there.

00:34:42,682 --> 00:34:44,550
Hey.

00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:46,386
You know how, when you
make a sandwich,

00:34:46,386 --> 00:34:47,687
you don't like
to use the heel?

00:34:47,687 --> 00:34:49,155
Right, so when
you open up

00:34:49,155 --> 00:34:51,557
the package of bread,
what do you do?

00:34:51,557 --> 00:34:54,260
I, uh... well, I move
the heel out of the way,

00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,162
reach past it
and I grab a slice

00:34:56,162 --> 00:34:58,097
from the middle
of the loaf.
Yeah, me, too.

00:34:58,097 --> 00:35:00,099
What's your point?
The point is,

00:35:00,099 --> 00:35:01,768
it's the same thing with
a newspaper machine.

00:35:01,768 --> 00:35:03,403
You don't take
the top copy,

00:35:03,403 --> 00:35:05,204
right, that has
a fold in it?

00:35:05,204 --> 00:35:07,440
You lift it up, and you
take the one underneath.

00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,443
Especially if you're
as OCD as this guy is.

00:35:10,443 --> 00:35:15,581
So he lifts it up and takes
a clean copy from the middle.

00:35:15,581 --> 00:35:16,849
He bought a paper
the day before--

00:35:16,849 --> 00:35:18,451
this one was on top--

00:35:18,451 --> 00:35:20,153
and that's how
his prints got on it?

00:35:20,153 --> 00:35:21,854
You think Basderic's prints
were already there

00:35:21,854 --> 00:35:23,456
when the cleaner
hid the guns there?

00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:28,494
Hey.
Hey.

00:35:28,494 --> 00:35:29,862
Find anything?

00:35:29,862 --> 00:35:31,764
Do you have any idea

00:35:31,764 --> 00:35:35,568
how many people touch this thing
on a given day, week, month?

00:35:35,568 --> 00:35:36,636
You check the inside?

00:35:36,636 --> 00:35:38,705
Door won't open.

00:35:38,705 --> 00:35:40,640
You need a quarter?

00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,375
Oh, that's funny.

00:35:42,375 --> 00:35:44,377
But the coin slot's jammed.

00:35:44,377 --> 00:35:47,447
My guess: it's
not by accident.

00:35:47,447 --> 00:35:48,815
Whoever stashed those guns

00:35:48,815 --> 00:35:51,417
probably didn't want
anyone to find them.

00:36:13,072 --> 00:36:14,841
What is it?

00:36:14,841 --> 00:36:17,377
It's a foreign coin.

00:36:17,377 --> 00:36:19,278
Chinese.

00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:21,647
Is that bad?

00:36:32,725 --> 00:36:34,861
Nick, you know me.

00:36:34,861 --> 00:36:36,596
I thought I did.

00:36:36,596 --> 00:36:37,730
Till I found that.

00:36:39,665 --> 00:36:42,135
You keep a bowl
below the register

00:36:42,135 --> 00:36:45,471
for all the foreign coins
that end up at the diner.

00:36:45,471 --> 00:36:47,173
You showed it
to me once, remember?

00:36:47,173 --> 00:36:48,775
Come on, it's a coin. So what?

00:36:48,775 --> 00:36:52,378
So I don't miss details,
Vincent.

00:36:52,378 --> 00:36:55,448
I want you to take a look
at a couple of photos.

00:37:01,354 --> 00:37:04,123
That's the apron you had on
when you went into the fridge.

00:37:04,123 --> 00:37:06,492
And that's the one you had on
when we let you out.

00:37:08,127 --> 00:37:09,295
Take a look at the strands.

00:37:10,396 --> 00:37:11,831
This one's white,

00:37:11,831 --> 00:37:13,466
and this one's blue.

00:37:15,168 --> 00:37:17,437
You switched the aprons.

00:37:17,437 --> 00:37:19,205
Wh-What?

00:37:19,205 --> 00:37:20,640
Why would I do that?

00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,575
To hide the evidence.

00:37:22,575 --> 00:37:24,510
It's the same reason
you moved the bodies

00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:25,745
and dumped the mop bucket.

00:37:30,483 --> 00:37:32,118
Here's the apron
you started with.

00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,522
I had to tear
the back room apart,

00:37:36,522 --> 00:37:37,857
but I found it.

00:37:37,857 --> 00:37:39,592
You've been working

00:37:39,592 --> 00:37:43,262
in that restaurant
since you were ten years old.

00:37:43,262 --> 00:37:45,364
I've never even known you
to take a vacation.

00:37:45,364 --> 00:37:47,333
I mean, I've seen
the car that you drive.

00:37:47,333 --> 00:37:49,435
You've sacrificed
everything

00:37:49,435 --> 00:37:52,171
to keep that
family business going.

00:37:52,171 --> 00:37:53,806
But your brother--

00:37:53,806 --> 00:37:55,608
he's a different story,
isn't he?

00:37:55,608 --> 00:37:57,710
He married a rich girl,

00:37:57,710 --> 00:38:00,446
he buys nice things,
he travels.

00:38:00,446 --> 00:38:03,616
And then, finally,
one day, your ship comes in.

00:38:03,616 --> 00:38:08,855
The Mediterranean wants to put
a Frank's Diner in the casino.

00:38:08,855 --> 00:38:11,791
That's got to be
a big payday, Vincent.

00:38:11,791 --> 00:38:15,261
How much was that worth?

00:38:15,261 --> 00:38:17,129
I don't know.
Sure, you do.

00:38:17,129 --> 00:38:19,198
You know exactly
how much.

00:38:19,198 --> 00:38:21,334
But your brother, he vetoed it.

00:38:21,334 --> 00:38:22,468
Didn't he?

00:38:22,468 --> 00:38:24,203
He said no.

00:38:24,203 --> 00:38:25,505
Hmm?

00:38:26,572 --> 00:38:29,575
That was my payoff.

00:38:29,575 --> 00:38:33,813
My reward for 40 years
of giving everything.

00:38:35,848 --> 00:38:38,684
And he said no, just like that.

00:38:38,684 --> 00:38:42,355
And now eight people are dead.

00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:45,191
I never wanted that to happen.

00:38:45,191 --> 00:38:50,429
Rios was supposed to
do a fake robbery.

00:38:50,429 --> 00:38:53,299
I knew Owen would fight back.

00:38:53,299 --> 00:38:56,435
<i>Rios was just supposed</i>
<i>to shoot him and get out.</i>

00:38:56,435 --> 00:38:58,170
<i>That's it.</i>

00:38:58,170 --> 00:38:59,505
What the hell did you do?

00:38:59,505 --> 00:39:00,506
What'd you do?

00:39:00,506 --> 00:39:01,741
He pulled off my mask.

00:39:01,741 --> 00:39:03,142
They saw my face.
I had no choice.

00:39:03,142 --> 00:39:04,744
STOKES:
<i>And at that point, you knew</i>

00:39:04,744 --> 00:39:07,113
<i>there was no turning back,</i>
<i>so you shot him.</i>

00:39:12,118 --> 00:39:13,653
<i>You were afraid</i>
<i>that we'd eventually</i>

00:39:13,653 --> 00:39:15,521
<i>connect Rios back to you,</i>

00:39:15,521 --> 00:39:19,625
<i>so you tried to make him look</i>
<i>like a customer.</i>

00:39:19,625 --> 00:39:21,794
<i>And moved the bodies.</i>

00:39:23,829 --> 00:39:25,798
VINCENT:
<i>The apron.</i>

00:39:25,798 --> 00:39:27,600
<i>The mop bucket.</i>

00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:33,139
<i>Like you said, I...</i>
<i>I learned a few things.</i>

00:39:33,139 --> 00:39:34,840
Not enough.

00:39:36,442 --> 00:39:38,444
Nick, please.

00:39:40,279 --> 00:39:43,182
Don't look at
me like that.

00:39:43,182 --> 00:39:45,318
I was just desperate.

00:39:46,786 --> 00:39:48,354
Just pushed too far.

00:39:49,722 --> 00:39:51,524
I'm not a monster.

00:39:51,524 --> 00:39:53,192
No?

00:39:53,192 --> 00:39:55,194
What about Edie?

00:39:56,796 --> 00:39:59,498
She was still alive, wasn't she?

00:40:01,601 --> 00:40:04,604
<i>And she witnessed</i>
<i>everything that you did.</i>

00:40:05,805 --> 00:40:08,140
<i>So you put a gun to her head...</i>

00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:10,610
(sobbing)

00:40:14,547 --> 00:40:16,482
...and you pulled the trigger.

00:40:35,601 --> 00:40:38,437
BASDERIC:
You see?

00:40:38,437 --> 00:40:40,773
You were wrong
about me.

00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:47,313
I didn't hurt her.

00:40:47,313 --> 00:40:49,348
I couldn't. I loved her.

00:40:49,348 --> 00:40:50,783
You loved her?

00:40:50,783 --> 00:40:52,451
Are you kidding me?

00:40:54,286 --> 00:40:55,721
You terrorized her.

00:40:55,721 --> 00:40:57,590
You kept her
awake at night.

00:40:57,590 --> 00:41:00,559
You made her afraid to
walk down the street.

00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:03,529
And you want to know what
else your twisted love did?

00:41:03,529 --> 00:41:05,564
It killed her, Ronald.

00:41:05,564 --> 00:41:08,334
Edie was supposed to
be off work at 4:00.

00:41:08,334 --> 00:41:10,469
She should have been gone
when the shooting happened,

00:41:10,469 --> 00:41:12,204
but she was afraid
to walk home

00:41:12,204 --> 00:41:14,473
because she was afraid
that you were out there.

00:41:14,473 --> 00:41:16,809
It's because of you
that she stayed,

00:41:16,809 --> 00:41:18,844
and now she's dead.

00:41:38,764 --> 00:41:40,766
RUSSELL:
I know, Barbara.

00:41:40,766 --> 00:41:43,202
I-I know that.

00:41:43,202 --> 00:41:45,337
But this is our home now.

00:41:45,337 --> 00:41:47,640
I'm here. Charlie's here.

00:41:51,077 --> 00:41:52,545
Uh, sweetheart,

00:41:52,545 --> 00:41:54,780
I'm going to have to call
you back, all right?

00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,449
I got to go.

00:41:56,449 --> 00:41:58,350
I love you.

00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:00,219
Hey.

00:42:00,219 --> 00:42:01,787
Hey.

00:42:01,787 --> 00:42:03,389
Is Barbara okay?

00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:06,192
Yeah.

00:42:06,192 --> 00:42:07,727
When's she coming back?

00:42:07,727 --> 00:42:09,328
Uh, she's going to stay

00:42:09,328 --> 00:42:11,764
up in Seattle
for a little while longer.

00:42:11,764 --> 00:42:13,699
Maya needs her.

00:42:16,102 --> 00:42:19,371
Do you need me to stay
for anything?

00:42:20,806 --> 00:42:22,742
No. Go home.

00:42:22,742 --> 00:42:25,244
Thank you.

00:42:25,244 --> 00:42:27,480
And good work on this one.

00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,415
Thanks.
