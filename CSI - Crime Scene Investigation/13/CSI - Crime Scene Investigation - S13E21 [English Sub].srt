00:00:01,622 --> 00:00:03,224
All right, we are in
the processing room.

00:00:03,224 --> 00:00:05,826
This is the center
of the slaughterhouse.

00:00:05,826 --> 00:00:08,162
This is where Walter Simms
was finally killed

00:00:08,162 --> 00:00:10,631
in a shootout with the police.

00:00:10,631 --> 00:00:14,969
And this is where we are going
to try to contact his ghost.

00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:17,772
(clattering)

00:00:21,275 --> 00:00:24,712
I definitely sense
a presence in here.

00:00:24,712 --> 00:00:26,981
A very strong presence.

00:00:26,981 --> 00:00:28,849
Yeah, my whole body
feels strange.

00:00:28,849 --> 00:00:30,651
Hair on my arm's standing up.

00:00:30,651 --> 00:00:34,355
I'm gonna roll my EVP recorder,
see what we get.

00:00:43,831 --> 00:00:46,100
Walter Simms, are you here?

00:00:47,168 --> 00:00:48,736
Come on, Walter.

00:00:48,736 --> 00:00:50,704
Talk to us.

00:00:50,704 --> 00:00:52,973
You still lingering?

00:00:52,973 --> 00:00:56,143
Relishing the seven
sadistic murders you committed?

00:00:57,711 --> 00:01:00,381
I'll tell you what I'm sensing.

00:01:00,381 --> 00:01:02,650
It's the boys.

00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:04,118
Their pain.

00:01:04,118 --> 00:01:06,153
God, do you feel that?

00:01:06,153 --> 00:01:08,289
I know the terrible
things you went through,

00:01:08,289 --> 00:01:11,659
but it's okay.

00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:13,294
No one can hurt you now.

00:01:18,098 --> 00:01:19,800
Guys, uh,

00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,703
I'm gonna go in the room
where the boys were held.

00:01:22,703 --> 00:01:24,672
Maybe it'll be easier
to make contact in there.

00:01:24,672 --> 00:01:25,840
Okay.

00:01:28,175 --> 00:01:30,311
I'm gonna set up for some
EMF measurements. Doug.

00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:33,013
You want to go check out
the hanging room?

00:01:34,815 --> 00:01:37,017
All right.

00:01:37,017 --> 00:01:38,419
(device beeping)

00:01:43,657 --> 00:01:46,260
It's been 20 years, and still,

00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,062
the feeling in this place,
it's...

00:01:48,062 --> 00:01:51,031
it's hard to describe
other than to say it feels...

00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:54,368
...heavy.

00:02:05,379 --> 00:02:08,749
This is where Walter Simms
did his dirty work.

00:02:10,818 --> 00:02:15,089
I want you to show yourself,
Walter.

00:02:15,089 --> 00:02:17,391
Make yourself known.

00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,929
Maybe this will entice him.

00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,204
Yeah, that's right.

00:02:30,204 --> 00:02:34,808
Just like the one you used
to butcher those boys.

00:02:34,808 --> 00:02:37,111
Why don't you come and get it?

00:02:37,111 --> 00:02:39,213
It's right there.

00:02:39,213 --> 00:02:40,915
Or are you too afraid

00:02:40,915 --> 00:02:43,784
because I'm not some
defenseless little child?

00:02:43,784 --> 00:02:45,853
(metallic jingling)

00:02:48,188 --> 00:02:49,223
The hooks are moving.

00:02:49,223 --> 00:02:50,824
(jingling)

00:02:50,824 --> 00:02:53,661
He's here.

00:02:53,661 --> 00:02:55,763
(jingling continues)

00:02:55,763 --> 00:02:58,699
(screaming)

00:03:00,401 --> 00:03:03,637
(screaming continues)

00:03:03,637 --> 00:03:05,406
Owen! Owen! Owen!

00:03:05,406 --> 00:03:06,807
It came from this way.

00:03:06,807 --> 00:03:08,342
Where's Doug?
Where is Doug?

00:03:08,342 --> 00:03:10,244
(screaming continues)

00:03:10,244 --> 00:03:11,879
(screaming stops)

00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:15,716
(woman whimpering)

00:03:15,716 --> 00:03:17,284
WOMAN:
Are you okay? Owen?

00:03:17,284 --> 00:03:18,953
(panting)

00:03:18,953 --> 00:03:19,887
(whispering):
What is that?

00:03:22,222 --> 00:03:24,058
(Carrie screams,
Owen yells)

00:03:24,058 --> 00:03:25,359
(screaming continues)

00:03:25,359 --> 00:03:27,294
(siren wailing)

00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:37,271
Really cheery place.

00:03:37,271 --> 00:03:39,306
Yeah, yeah,
tell me about it.

00:03:39,306 --> 00:03:42,409
I spent a lot of time here
working on the original case.

00:03:42,409 --> 00:03:44,411
What do you mean,
original case?

00:03:44,411 --> 00:03:46,413
Oh, uh, 20 years ago,

00:03:46,413 --> 00:03:48,682
the security guard,
Walter Simms--

00:03:48,682 --> 00:03:50,084
he lived in a
trailer on-site.

00:03:50,084 --> 00:03:51,819
This guy, Simms,

00:03:51,819 --> 00:03:55,022
abducted seven boys
over a nine-month period,

00:03:55,022 --> 00:03:57,925
brought them here
and killed them.

00:03:57,925 --> 00:03:59,326
Mmm.
And I mean

00:03:59,326 --> 00:04:01,996
really grisly stuff.

00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:08,135
So he ended up
dying here himself.

00:04:08,135 --> 00:04:10,371
After escaping
his sentencing hearing,

00:04:10,371 --> 00:04:11,805
he shot it out
with the PD.

00:04:11,805 --> 00:04:12,806
So you're saying

00:04:12,806 --> 00:04:14,008
that this homicide

00:04:14,008 --> 00:04:15,209
is related to the
original case.

00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:16,343
Yeah, the victim tonight

00:04:16,343 --> 00:04:18,312
is rigged up
just like the boys were.

00:04:24,084 --> 00:04:26,120
The hook,
the evisceration--

00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,722
exactly what Simms did
20 years ago.

00:04:32,393 --> 00:04:35,095
You know,
if I didn't know any better,

00:04:35,095 --> 00:04:38,766
I'd say that old Walter
was back from the dead.

PHILLIPS:
I remember I was
in sixth grade

00:05:24,078 --> 00:05:25,312
when all this was going on.

00:05:25,312 --> 00:05:27,881
Walter Simms--
called him "The Butcher."

00:05:27,881 --> 00:05:29,950
Of course, we didn't know
it was Simms at the time.

00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:32,052
We just knew
that kids were disappearing.

00:05:32,052 --> 00:05:35,054
Kids... my age.

00:05:35,054 --> 00:05:37,623
And even after
Simms was killed,

00:05:37,623 --> 00:05:39,392
his legend lived on.

00:05:39,392 --> 00:05:42,995
They say that if you say
his name three times,

00:05:42,995 --> 00:05:44,931
he'll come back to life

00:05:44,931 --> 00:05:46,566
and gut you.

00:05:46,566 --> 00:05:48,468
Maybe that's what happened
to our victim.

00:05:48,468 --> 00:05:49,535
Let's try it.

00:05:49,535 --> 00:05:50,737
I'll conjure him up.

00:05:50,737 --> 00:05:51,871
You slap the
cuffs on him.

00:05:51,871 --> 00:05:53,873
Walter Simms.

00:05:53,873 --> 00:05:55,475
Walter Simms.

00:05:55,475 --> 00:05:56,642
Walter...

00:05:56,642 --> 00:05:58,578
Don't! If you want to do that

00:05:58,578 --> 00:06:00,680
sort of stuff,
you could do it when I'm gone.

00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,948
Let's go.

00:06:07,286 --> 00:06:09,255
Oh, you can really see
why this place spawned

00:06:09,255 --> 00:06:10,723
so many ghost
stories, huh?

00:06:10,723 --> 00:06:13,326
Oh, yeah. This place creeps
me out in all kinds of ways.

00:06:13,326 --> 00:06:14,560
Slaughterhouse...

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,629
This is why
I stopped eating meat.

00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:17,697
Yeah, really.

00:06:17,697 --> 00:06:19,832
So, no murder weapon?

00:06:19,832 --> 00:06:22,301
No. Smear is from one
of the victim's partners.

00:06:22,301 --> 00:06:23,836
They're the ones
that found him.

00:06:23,836 --> 00:06:25,772
The male slipped
and fell in the blood

00:06:25,772 --> 00:06:27,807
trying to get the victim down.

00:06:29,675 --> 00:06:31,511
Did our people touch this?

00:06:31,511 --> 00:06:33,980
No. You think
it's been moved?

00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,848
Well, there's blood
on the bottom,

00:06:35,848 --> 00:06:37,583
but it wasn't in the blood pool.

00:06:39,685 --> 00:06:41,587
There's no memory card.

00:06:41,587 --> 00:06:42,789
Somebody must have taken it.

00:06:44,457 --> 00:06:46,259
Hold up your arms.

00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:47,960
Okay.

00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,763
I mean, man, this is just crazy,
you know?

00:06:50,763 --> 00:06:53,933
I'm gonna need you to give me
your clothes at some point,

00:06:53,933 --> 00:06:55,401
since you fell in the blood.

00:06:55,401 --> 00:06:57,403
Yeah, sure.
I got others in the car.

00:06:57,403 --> 00:07:00,306
I mean, God, I just
can't believe this.

00:07:00,306 --> 00:07:03,309
I mean, seriously,
Carrie, can you?

00:07:04,877 --> 00:07:09,415
So, uh, how long have you been
doing this... ghost hunting?

00:07:09,415 --> 00:07:10,817
I don't know.

00:07:10,817 --> 00:07:12,852
I've always been sensitive,

00:07:12,852 --> 00:07:16,422
you know, to... things
from the other side.

00:07:16,422 --> 00:07:19,025
But working with Doug
and Owen-- that's new.

00:07:19,025 --> 00:07:20,827
A few months, maybe?

00:07:20,827 --> 00:07:24,463
And you were filming
for some TV show or something?

00:07:24,463 --> 00:07:27,033
No, it's, uh, for
the Internet, mostly.

00:07:27,033 --> 00:07:29,435
A lot of people do this.
They upload videos.

00:07:29,435 --> 00:07:30,837
It's... it's
really nothing.

00:07:30,837 --> 00:07:32,672
Well, it's not
nothing anymore.

00:07:32,672 --> 00:07:34,006
I mean, holy crap,

00:07:34,006 --> 00:07:36,542
if we have definitive proof
of the spirit world

00:07:36,542 --> 00:07:40,479
crossing over like this--
I mean, are you kidding me?

00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:41,814
Owen, just stop!

00:07:41,814 --> 00:07:43,416
Doug's dead.

00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:44,817
(sighs)

00:07:44,817 --> 00:07:46,953
You don't really think
your friend was killed

00:07:46,953 --> 00:07:48,054
by a ghost, do you?

00:07:49,522 --> 00:07:51,490
You haven't been inside,
have you?

00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:54,594
I've been in a lot
of haunted places,

00:07:54,594 --> 00:07:56,362
and I've never felt

00:07:56,362 --> 00:07:58,698
anything as strong
as what I felt in there.

00:07:58,698 --> 00:08:00,900
That's why I wear this.

00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:04,003
It's always
protected me.

00:08:04,003 --> 00:08:05,838
(footsteps approaching)

00:08:05,838 --> 00:08:07,807
I'm gonna ask you
one question.

00:08:07,807 --> 00:08:10,776
Then I'm gonna give you
one chance to answer it.

00:08:10,776 --> 00:08:12,745
Where's the memory card that
was in your friend's camera?

00:08:12,745 --> 00:08:14,614
I don't know what you mean.

00:08:14,614 --> 00:08:16,849
He was filming, right,
with the camera?

00:08:16,849 --> 00:08:18,885
So where's the memory card
that was in it?

00:08:18,885 --> 00:08:20,920
I... (scoffs)
Okay. I'm gonna have

00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,788
to confiscate all of
your shooting equipment.

00:08:22,788 --> 00:08:24,257
No, wait.
Okay, okay, uh,

00:08:24,257 --> 00:08:27,260
I-I took it, okay,
but I-I need it.

00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:30,563
I mean, what if Doug
actually filmed his killer?

00:08:30,563 --> 00:08:33,866
Yeah. What if?

00:08:33,866 --> 00:08:36,736
I'm Captain Jim Brass,
Las Vegas Police.

00:08:36,736 --> 00:08:38,304
You the property manager?

00:08:38,304 --> 00:08:39,739
Thomas Pope.

00:08:39,739 --> 00:08:41,774
My firm is developing
the property.

00:08:41,774 --> 00:08:43,442
So you've been told
what happened?

00:08:43,442 --> 00:08:45,411
Just that somebody was killed.

00:08:45,411 --> 00:08:46,946
One of the ghost hunters.

00:08:46,946 --> 00:08:48,981
Oh, so you knew
they were here?

00:08:48,981 --> 00:08:50,516
Yeah, yeah, they had permission.

00:08:50,516 --> 00:08:52,585
My boss approved it.
I handled the paperwork.

00:08:52,585 --> 00:08:54,520
They signed about a million
liability releases.

00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,822
Thank God, right?

00:08:56,822 --> 00:08:58,557
I guess.

00:08:58,557 --> 00:09:01,994
Look, I... I didn't mean it
to sound like that. I...

00:09:01,994 --> 00:09:04,931
Can I ask what
happened exactly?

00:09:04,931 --> 00:09:05,998
We don't know yet.

00:09:07,566 --> 00:09:08,868
You know, I warned my boss

00:09:08,868 --> 00:09:10,703
that something bad
was gonna happen.

00:09:10,703 --> 00:09:12,505
I knew it.

00:09:12,505 --> 00:09:14,573
What do you mean, you knew it?

00:09:14,573 --> 00:09:16,909
I spent some time inside here.

00:09:16,909 --> 00:09:18,811
There's a feeling.

00:09:18,811 --> 00:09:21,347
A feeling?

00:09:21,347 --> 00:09:22,815
So you people take
all the time you need.

00:09:22,815 --> 00:09:24,550
The minute you're done,

00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,585
I'm knocking the whole
place down-- the building

00:09:26,585 --> 00:09:28,955
and all the ghosts inside.

00:09:32,024 --> 00:09:33,592
Hey, Doc.

00:09:33,592 --> 00:09:35,528
A little shorthanded,
are you, today?

00:09:35,528 --> 00:09:36,996
Normally, you
don't call me in

00:09:36,996 --> 00:09:39,432
until you're done
with all the scary stuff.

00:09:39,432 --> 00:09:41,600
Normally, but I wanted you
to see something

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,903
on the victim David brought in
from the slaughterhouse.

00:09:43,903 --> 00:09:46,973
Heard the murder was reminiscent
of a previous crime.

00:09:46,973 --> 00:09:48,908
Well, that's why you're here.

00:09:48,908 --> 00:09:51,444
The killing
wasn't just reminiscent.

00:09:51,444 --> 00:09:54,814
It was an exact duplication
of the original crimes.

00:09:54,814 --> 00:09:57,450
So, killer did
his homework, right?

00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:58,784
I don't see how.

00:09:58,784 --> 00:10:00,619
The original victims
were all juveniles.

00:10:00,619 --> 00:10:03,656
Their autopsy reports
were very closely guarded.

00:10:03,656 --> 00:10:05,558
They were never made public.

00:10:05,558 --> 00:10:08,694
And the M.O. unique enough that
it couldn't just be by chance?

00:10:08,694 --> 00:10:09,862
I would say not.

00:10:11,697 --> 00:10:13,799
The incision
the killer made--

00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:15,534
it isn't a straight cut
like a butcher

00:10:15,534 --> 00:10:17,403
or a hunter would make
when dressing an animal.

00:10:17,403 --> 00:10:18,704
It waivers

00:10:18,704 --> 00:10:22,908
to the left, to the right,
and then back again.

00:10:22,908 --> 00:10:25,745
It's almost as if
he was carving an "S."

00:10:25,745 --> 00:10:27,613
"S" for Simms.

00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,489
Seems like every town has

00:10:36,489 --> 00:10:40,626
a place like this that all
the teenagers know about.

00:10:40,626 --> 00:10:42,528
Yeah, their parents don't.

00:10:42,528 --> 00:10:45,631
Obviously, it's not
impossible to get in here.

00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,899
Which means our ghost hunters

00:10:46,899 --> 00:10:48,667
may not have been alone
last night.

00:11:07,453 --> 00:11:09,622
Morgan.
Come look at this.

00:11:15,594 --> 00:11:18,264
It's a shrine.

00:11:18,264 --> 00:11:21,000
To the seven boys
who were murdered here.

00:11:22,735 --> 00:11:25,771
Some of this stuff looks
like it's been here forever.

00:11:25,771 --> 00:11:27,606
Yeah, and some of this stuff
looks like it's...

00:11:27,606 --> 00:11:28,974
pretty new.

00:11:28,974 --> 00:11:30,276
Someone's been coming
here and making

00:11:30,276 --> 00:11:31,644
offerings to these kids.

00:11:31,644 --> 00:11:33,279
Or to their ghosts.

00:11:37,783 --> 00:11:39,418
What?

00:11:39,418 --> 00:11:40,786
Did you hear something?

00:11:40,786 --> 00:11:42,555
No.

00:11:42,555 --> 00:11:44,557
No, it's nothing.

00:11:46,792 --> 00:11:48,727
BRODY:
Hey.

00:11:49,795 --> 00:11:51,764
Did you notice...

00:11:51,764 --> 00:11:53,833
if our female ghost hunter
from earlier

00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:56,268
was missing
an earring?

00:11:57,403 --> 00:11:59,271
SANDERS:
No.

00:11:59,271 --> 00:12:00,439
That's not hers.

00:12:00,439 --> 00:12:03,642
Makes me wonder whose, then.

00:12:03,642 --> 00:12:05,911
So, let's say you're the victim.

00:12:05,911 --> 00:12:07,379
It's dark.

00:12:07,379 --> 00:12:09,381
Your back is turned.
You're filming.

00:12:09,381 --> 00:12:13,486
I swing this hook hard enough
to bury it in your back.

00:12:13,486 --> 00:12:15,888
Well, that would be more
than enough to incapacitate me

00:12:15,888 --> 00:12:18,324
so you could hoist me
up into the air.

00:12:18,324 --> 00:12:20,659
And then it's just a single
slash with the blade.

00:12:20,659 --> 00:12:22,628
Yeah. So there's no reason
it couldn't have been

00:12:22,628 --> 00:12:24,330
one person working alone.

00:12:26,298 --> 00:12:28,834
All right, let's Luminol
everything, make sure we didn't

00:12:28,834 --> 00:12:30,436
miss any blood.
(phone ringing)

00:12:30,436 --> 00:12:32,304
It's for you.

00:12:32,304 --> 00:12:33,939
Do you want it? SFPD.

00:12:33,939 --> 00:12:35,875
I'll call them back.

00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:45,651
I'm gonna hit the lights.
Okay.

00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,855
Whoa.

00:12:49,855 --> 00:12:51,323
Oh, my God.

00:12:51,323 --> 00:12:53,792
There's blood everywhere.

00:12:53,792 --> 00:12:55,661
Must be animal blood.

00:12:55,661 --> 00:12:57,263
This is the kill room.

00:12:57,263 --> 00:12:58,898
Floor must be
porous enough

00:12:58,898 --> 00:13:01,767
that the blood
is still present.

00:13:01,767 --> 00:13:04,737
I'm going to go do the hallway.

00:13:12,678 --> 00:13:14,713
Finn?
Yeah.

00:13:14,713 --> 00:13:17,016
Come here
and look at this.

00:13:18,651 --> 00:13:20,786
Wow. Everybody's
going in and out,

00:13:20,786 --> 00:13:23,489
tracking the old animal blood
without even knowing it.

00:13:23,489 --> 00:13:24,924
There's the wheel marks
from David's gurney.

00:13:24,924 --> 00:13:27,526
Mm-hmm.

00:13:27,526 --> 00:13:28,961
And look over there.

00:13:28,961 --> 00:13:30,429
There's one set of prints
going the other way.

00:13:35,901 --> 00:13:37,770
The hall dead-ends.

00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:39,505
Where would they be going?

00:13:39,505 --> 00:13:42,841
Looks like they walk
right through the wall.

00:13:42,841 --> 00:13:44,843
Or right up to it.
There's got to be some reason

00:13:44,843 --> 00:13:46,946
whoever left these
came down here.

00:13:56,755 --> 00:13:58,991
There's something in here.

00:14:05,831 --> 00:14:08,801
Yes, there is.

00:14:08,801 --> 00:14:11,403
Hey. I think Hodges
caught us a break.

00:14:11,403 --> 00:14:12,671
Check this out.

00:14:12,671 --> 00:14:14,340
What am I looking at?

00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,375
You're looking
at footage from one of

00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:17,743
the ghost hunter's cameras.

00:14:17,743 --> 00:14:19,712
The surviving male,
Owen Webber.

00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,915
Now, according
to his statement,

00:14:22,915 --> 00:14:25,451
he was alone in the processing
room during the murder.

00:14:25,451 --> 00:14:26,852
Which it looks
like he is, right?

00:14:26,852 --> 00:14:28,520
Well, keep watching there.

00:14:30,956 --> 00:14:33,826
You see that?
You mean that little glitch
in the picture?

00:14:33,826 --> 00:14:35,294
That's more than just a glitch.

00:14:35,294 --> 00:14:36,562
His camera shut off

00:14:36,562 --> 00:14:38,264
for 98 seconds.

00:14:38,264 --> 00:14:40,499
That might be enough time
to commit the murder.

00:14:40,499 --> 00:14:41,867
That's more than enough time.
(knocking)

00:14:41,867 --> 00:14:43,636
RUSSELL:
Oh!

00:14:43,636 --> 00:14:45,738
Look at you. You got
yourself a murder weapon.

00:14:45,738 --> 00:14:47,506
It was stashed just outside
the murder room.

00:14:47,506 --> 00:14:50,276
Killer probably planned
to go back and get it later.

00:14:50,276 --> 00:14:53,779
What makes you say that?
Well, because he didn't bother
to wipe off his fingerprints.

00:14:53,779 --> 00:14:54,913
You got prints?

00:14:54,913 --> 00:14:57,483
Victim's partner. Owen Webber.

00:15:05,024 --> 00:15:07,559
Well, it's about time.

00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:08,827
When am I gonna
get my gear back?

00:15:08,827 --> 00:15:09,928
You're not gonna
get your gear back.

00:15:09,928 --> 00:15:11,363
What?
Well, your gear

00:15:11,363 --> 00:15:12,831
is what we now
call evidence, Owen.

00:15:12,831 --> 00:15:14,400
Well, I know that it's evidence.

00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,634
That's why I need it.

00:15:15,634 --> 00:15:17,336
The online paranormal groups
are going nuts

00:15:17,336 --> 00:15:19,338
over what happened to Doug.
I need the proof.

00:15:19,338 --> 00:15:21,273
I need to show them
that it was Simms.

00:15:21,273 --> 00:15:22,608
Sit down.

00:15:22,608 --> 00:15:24,510
And let's talk

00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:26,512
about what you did to Doug.

00:15:28,947 --> 00:15:30,582
STOKES:
You recognize that, Owen?

00:15:30,582 --> 00:15:31,917
It's mine.

00:15:31,917 --> 00:15:34,019
I brought it along
to the slaughterhouse.

00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:36,388
Sounds like premeditation.
Uh, no.

00:15:36,388 --> 00:15:39,525
I-I... I brought it
to excite the spirits.

00:15:39,525 --> 00:15:41,827
We use objects,
something

00:15:41,827 --> 00:15:45,297
emotionally significant
to the dead to provoke them.

00:15:45,297 --> 00:15:49,034
I mean, come on, man,
that's Ghost Chasing 101.

00:15:49,034 --> 00:15:50,836
That's Murder 101.

00:15:50,836 --> 00:15:52,538
What?!
Why else did you

00:15:52,538 --> 00:15:54,907
turn off the camera
right before Doug was killed?

00:15:54,907 --> 00:15:57,042
I didn't turn off the camera.
My battery pack went dead.

00:15:57,042 --> 00:15:59,478
Don't you check your batteries
before you start?

00:15:59,478 --> 00:16:00,713
Yeah, of course I did.

00:16:00,713 --> 00:16:01,980
And they were both full.

00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,516
But spirits can siphon
the power away.

00:16:04,516 --> 00:16:06,885
That's how they get the energy
to materialize.

00:16:06,885 --> 00:16:08,821
Come on, Shaggy.
My BS meter is redlining

00:16:08,821 --> 00:16:10,589
with all this ghost science
of yours.

00:16:10,589 --> 00:16:11,790
What BS?

00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,292
The knife

00:16:13,292 --> 00:16:14,626
provoked Walter Simms.

00:16:14,626 --> 00:16:15,994
The battery

00:16:15,994 --> 00:16:18,430
provided the energy
he needed.

00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:20,966
The very fact that Doug is dead
is proof positive

00:16:20,966 --> 00:16:22,534
of what I'm telling you!

00:16:26,872 --> 00:16:28,807
Owen didn't kill Doug,
I'm telling you.

00:16:28,807 --> 00:16:29,975
Because you
believe a...

00:16:29,975 --> 00:16:31,477
ghost killed Doug?

00:16:31,477 --> 00:16:33,278
Because I know Owen.

00:16:33,278 --> 00:16:35,280
He would never.

00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,050
Well, right now,
the evidence says otherwise.

00:16:39,818 --> 00:16:42,254
You went into the
slaughterhouse, didn't you?

00:16:42,254 --> 00:16:43,922
(sighs)

00:16:43,922 --> 00:16:45,758
You know now
what I was talking about,

00:16:45,758 --> 00:16:47,359
those little boys...

00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,761
The only thing
I felt in there...

00:16:48,761 --> 00:16:50,462
was cold.

00:16:50,462 --> 00:16:51,997
If you'll excuse me.

00:16:54,266 --> 00:16:55,968
Why are you denying your gift?

00:16:55,968 --> 00:16:58,504
Your grandmother is still
with you, you know.

00:16:58,504 --> 00:17:01,540
Even though you try to push
her away, she's still there.

00:17:06,678 --> 00:17:10,015
What do you know
about my grandmother?

00:17:10,015 --> 00:17:13,419
She had a funny name.

00:17:13,419 --> 00:17:16,388
(chuckles)
Olaf, was it?

00:17:16,388 --> 00:17:18,624
And she was a psychic.

00:17:18,624 --> 00:17:20,959
Seems to think you are, too.

00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,429
You share her gift.

00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:27,032
What do you want from me?

00:17:27,032 --> 00:17:28,600
Your help.

00:17:29,935 --> 00:17:31,970
You heard those boys.

00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:34,039
I know they were trying
to say something.

00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:35,541
I-I just don't know what it is.

00:17:38,043 --> 00:17:39,778
I'm sorry,

00:17:39,778 --> 00:17:41,847
but I can't help you.

00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:46,685
Thanks, but...

00:17:46,685 --> 00:17:47,853
I don't want that.

00:17:49,555 --> 00:17:51,423
You need it.

00:17:57,563 --> 00:17:59,698
ANDREWS:
What are all these?

00:17:59,698 --> 00:18:02,501
Tools of the trade
for the modern ghost hunter.

00:18:02,501 --> 00:18:04,536
E.M. pump,
motion sensors,

00:18:04,536 --> 00:18:07,506
thermal imager, EMF detectors.

00:18:07,506 --> 00:18:09,541
Ghost Meter Pro? Really?

00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:10,909
Someone actually makes these?

00:18:10,909 --> 00:18:12,044
That's not a toy.

00:18:12,044 --> 00:18:13,712
I just spoke with Nick.

00:18:13,712 --> 00:18:15,747
Apparently the interrogation
was less than fruitful.

00:18:15,747 --> 00:18:18,016
He's hoping that we can find
a way to pinpoint

00:18:18,016 --> 00:18:19,051
the exact location
of the suspect

00:18:19,051 --> 00:18:20,519
during the time of the murder.

00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:22,588
But both his cameras
were off, right?

00:18:22,588 --> 00:18:25,724
His cameras were off, but
his EVP recorder was still on.

00:18:25,724 --> 00:18:26,992
EVP?

00:18:26,992 --> 00:18:28,927
Electronic Voice
Phenomenon.

00:18:28,927 --> 00:18:32,331
Ghost voices we might
otherwise miss.

00:18:32,331 --> 00:18:33,699
The point is, even though

00:18:33,699 --> 00:18:35,300
we don't have picture,
we have sound.

00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,969
Ah. And you think
you can use the sound

00:18:36,969 --> 00:18:38,570
to figure out
where the suspect was.

00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:40,005
That is the idea, yes.

00:18:40,005 --> 00:18:42,341
So, why do you need me?

00:18:42,341 --> 00:18:43,709
You mean, aside from the fact

00:18:43,709 --> 00:18:45,911
that I greatly admire your mind
and abilities?

00:18:48,313 --> 00:18:50,616
The job requires going back
to the slaughterhouse,

00:18:50,616 --> 00:18:53,652
and that is something
that I don't relish doing alone.

00:18:55,387 --> 00:18:57,422
Hey, Jules?

00:18:57,422 --> 00:18:58,423
Do you got a moment?

00:18:58,423 --> 00:18:59,791
Sure.

00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:01,760
Want you to introduce
you to Scott Tunnicliff.

00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,028
CSI Finlay.

00:19:03,028 --> 00:19:04,329
Nice to meet you.

00:19:04,329 --> 00:19:05,731
Scott's kind of
an expert

00:19:05,731 --> 00:19:07,933
on Walter Simms
and the slaughterhouse murders.

00:19:07,933 --> 00:19:08,967
Wrote a book

00:19:08,967 --> 00:19:09,968
back in the day.

00:19:09,968 --> 00:19:11,703
Ah. You working on a sequel?

00:19:11,703 --> 00:19:13,338
No, actually, I brought him in.

00:19:13,338 --> 00:19:15,374
He had considerable access
to the investigation

00:19:15,374 --> 00:19:16,975
at the time.
My uncle was...

00:19:16,975 --> 00:19:20,412
undersheriff, so admittedly,
I got... special treatment.

00:19:20,412 --> 00:19:21,847
But I brought along
all my old

00:19:21,847 --> 00:19:23,315
raw research material

00:19:23,315 --> 00:19:24,716
if it'll help.

00:19:24,716 --> 00:19:26,818
Tell her your
theory, Scott.

00:19:26,818 --> 00:19:29,721
I've always felt, uh,
Simms had an accomplice.

00:19:29,721 --> 00:19:30,822
Uh, someone to help

00:19:30,822 --> 00:19:32,424
lure the boys into the car.

00:19:32,424 --> 00:19:33,725
RUSSELL:
Yeah, look at this.
This is a photo

00:19:33,725 --> 00:19:35,561
of Simms.
That's a real boogeyman.

00:19:35,561 --> 00:19:36,595
Yeah, not
really a face

00:19:36,595 --> 00:19:37,829
that kids would flock to.

00:19:37,829 --> 00:19:39,498
There were witnesses
to three

00:19:39,498 --> 00:19:41,266
of the abductions.
The statements were the same.

00:19:41,266 --> 00:19:42,801
The boys approached
Simms' car,

00:19:42,801 --> 00:19:44,703
climbed in
on their own accord.

00:19:44,703 --> 00:19:47,272
So, might be Simms had help.

00:19:47,272 --> 00:19:48,774
FINLAY:
Who's this woman?

00:19:48,774 --> 00:19:50,709
She's in every trial photo.

00:19:50,709 --> 00:19:52,277
She was a trial groupie.

00:19:52,277 --> 00:19:54,379
Showed up every day,
never took her eyes off Simms.

00:19:54,379 --> 00:19:55,814
Was obsessed with him.

00:19:55,814 --> 00:19:56,949
RUSSELL:
Why?

00:19:56,949 --> 00:19:58,283
What do you see?

00:19:58,283 --> 00:19:59,451
Her earring.

00:19:59,451 --> 00:20:00,752
It looks exactly
like the earring

00:20:00,752 --> 00:20:02,721
Morgan found
at the slaughterhouse.

00:20:02,721 --> 00:20:04,022
If it is, she was there.

00:20:05,324 --> 00:20:07,326
So, where is she now?

00:20:07,326 --> 00:20:09,962
(shouting)

00:20:09,962 --> 00:20:11,263
How was that?

00:20:11,263 --> 00:20:12,598
HODGES:
All right,
do it again.

00:20:12,598 --> 00:20:16,301
This time, a little higher
like on the recording.

00:20:16,301 --> 00:20:19,471
(higher-pitched shouting)

00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:24,476
All right, I think you nailed it
on that last one.

00:20:24,476 --> 00:20:26,478
Pretty sure we can pinpoint
where Owen was now.

00:20:26,478 --> 00:20:28,714
Yeah.

00:20:28,714 --> 00:20:30,682
No way he was the killer.

00:20:30,682 --> 00:20:33,318
He was in this room
when the murders happened.

00:20:33,318 --> 00:20:35,320
Of course, that means
that our killer

00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:38,357
is still on the loose, right?
(chuckles)

00:20:44,563 --> 00:20:45,697
(gasps)

00:20:45,697 --> 00:20:46,698
(sighs)

00:20:46,698 --> 00:20:48,567
How'd we do?

00:20:48,567 --> 00:20:50,502
I hope you got
what you needed.

00:20:50,502 --> 00:20:52,037
My throat
is killing me.

00:20:52,037 --> 00:20:53,572
Well, we cleared
Owen as the killer.

00:20:54,873 --> 00:20:56,408
Did you see all this
low-end activity

00:20:56,408 --> 00:20:57,743
running through
the center?

00:20:57,743 --> 00:20:59,411
Yeah, it's some sort
of low-frequency wave.

00:20:59,411 --> 00:21:01,013
Seems to be present
everywhere in this place.

00:21:01,013 --> 00:21:02,681
But we can't hear it
because it's...

00:21:02,681 --> 00:21:04,683
Because it's below
the human range of hearing.

00:21:04,683 --> 00:21:06,852
It's infrasound.

00:21:06,852 --> 00:21:08,854
Can you, uh, pitch it up?
Raise the frequency

00:21:08,854 --> 00:21:10,722
until we
can hear it?
Mmm.

00:21:10,722 --> 00:21:12,524
(low, rumbling tone)

00:21:14,893 --> 00:21:17,996
Yeah. You know, there are
studies that actually suggest

00:21:17,996 --> 00:21:21,466
that infrasound could be the
scientific cause of hauntings.

00:21:21,466 --> 00:21:25,504
The vibrations create sensory
phenomena suggestive of a ghost.

00:21:25,504 --> 00:21:27,039
Fascinating. Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:28,840
You'll have to show me
those articles some time.

00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,677
We could test the theory now,
by finding the source

00:21:31,677 --> 00:21:33,679
of the low-frequency waves
and eliminating it.

00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,313
Science!

00:21:40,519 --> 00:21:42,421
Wow. Who's the crazy?

00:21:42,421 --> 00:21:44,790
Ah, you can tell
right away, right?

00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:47,459
This woman was obsessed
with Walter Simms.

00:21:47,459 --> 00:21:50,662
Mmm.
She was at his trial
every single day.

00:21:50,662 --> 00:21:52,030
Yeah, we've dealt
with a few women like this.

00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:53,432
I'll never understand it.

00:21:53,432 --> 00:21:56,301
So, I think she could be
our killer.

00:21:56,301 --> 00:21:58,570
But there is no record
of her name.

00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:01,540
I did a facial recognition
search against our database,

00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,341
and I got nothing.

00:22:03,341 --> 00:22:06,678
Why not try running one just
against Internet images?

00:22:06,678 --> 00:22:08,346
She didn't hide from
the camera before.

00:22:08,346 --> 00:22:09,781
Why should she be
any different now?

00:22:10,849 --> 00:22:12,451
All right, let's run it.

00:22:14,386 --> 00:22:15,487
Who knows?

00:22:15,487 --> 00:22:17,355
You know, maybe she's...

00:22:17,355 --> 00:22:18,757
turned her life
around by now.

00:22:20,859 --> 00:22:22,394
That one.

00:22:22,394 --> 00:22:24,029
Monica Downs.

00:22:24,029 --> 00:22:25,964
Wow, she even has a
Friend Agenda page.

00:22:29,668 --> 00:22:31,269
Hmm.

00:22:31,269 --> 00:22:34,306
20 years has done nothing
to cure the crazy.

00:22:34,306 --> 00:22:35,540
The basic theory
behind infrasound

00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:37,476
is that, even though
we can't hear it,

00:22:37,476 --> 00:22:39,945
it still has a physiological
effect on us.

00:22:39,945 --> 00:22:41,747
The low frequency waves
cause vibrations

00:22:41,747 --> 00:22:43,482
in different parts
of our bodies.

00:22:43,482 --> 00:22:44,950
(beeping)

00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:47,853
Getting stronger.

00:22:47,853 --> 00:22:49,988
I hear some other
noises, as well.

00:22:51,389 --> 00:22:52,791
Here, this way.
Okay.

00:22:52,791 --> 00:22:55,427
So, as a result,
people experience

00:22:55,427 --> 00:22:57,596
butterflies
in the stomach, chills,

00:22:57,596 --> 00:22:59,564
hairs standing on end...

00:22:59,564 --> 00:23:01,366
Check, check and check.

00:23:01,366 --> 00:23:02,934
Not realizing
there's a physical cause,

00:23:02,934 --> 00:23:05,504
people attribute
all these sensations to...

00:23:06,738 --> 00:23:08,940
...a haunting.

00:23:14,379 --> 00:23:17,048
Feeling's getting
stronger here.

00:23:17,048 --> 00:23:18,750
Definitely oppressive.
Yeah.

00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:21,987
This is it. This is what's
generating the infrasound.

00:23:21,987 --> 00:23:23,522
Oh, well, here's an idea:

00:23:23,522 --> 00:23:25,490
Let's turn it off.

00:23:29,494 --> 00:23:30,829
Uh...

00:23:30,829 --> 00:23:32,030
Uh...

00:23:36,935 --> 00:23:38,637
(fan whines)

00:23:40,472 --> 00:23:41,706
(chuckles)

00:23:41,706 --> 00:23:42,908
That's amazing.

00:23:42,908 --> 00:23:43,942
The oppressive feeling's gone.

00:23:43,942 --> 00:23:45,610
The chills, the stomach...

00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:47,045
It's gone, right?
Yeah.

00:23:47,045 --> 00:23:50,415
All these years,
the sensation everyone's had

00:23:50,415 --> 00:23:51,850
that this place is haunted...

00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:53,451
It's perfectly benign.

00:23:53,451 --> 00:23:54,753
There's nothing
bad here at all.

00:23:54,753 --> 00:23:57,355
(woman screams)
Aah!

00:23:57,355 --> 00:23:58,456
WOMAN: No! No!
(metal clanging)

00:23:58,456 --> 00:23:59,658
Okay, what is that?

00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,295
Oh, no, nothing bad
can happen here.

00:24:03,295 --> 00:24:04,496
There's no haunting.

00:24:04,496 --> 00:24:05,664
It's just sound waves!
Shh.

00:24:05,664 --> 00:24:06,665
This way.

00:24:06,665 --> 00:24:08,366
We got blood.

00:24:12,404 --> 00:24:14,506
ANDREWS:
Oh, God, it's one
of the ghost hunters.

00:24:14,506 --> 00:24:16,007
Your infrasound
can't explain that.

00:24:16,007 --> 00:24:17,542
Yeah, it's Hodges.

00:24:17,542 --> 00:24:19,277
We need help.

00:24:34,726 --> 00:24:36,461
So...

00:24:36,461 --> 00:24:38,930
it looks like
she was sitting there,

00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:40,665
in front of the shrine.

00:24:40,665 --> 00:24:43,668
Killer surprised her, maybe.

00:24:43,668 --> 00:24:46,471
Hit her as she
turned around.

00:24:46,471 --> 00:24:48,406
The bat was here already.

00:24:48,406 --> 00:24:49,541
You remember?

00:24:49,541 --> 00:24:51,443
It was part
of the toy collection.

00:24:51,443 --> 00:24:53,545
What I can't figure out
is why she came back here

00:24:53,545 --> 00:24:54,779
in the first place.

00:24:54,779 --> 00:24:56,481
She came because of the boys.

00:24:57,549 --> 00:24:59,484
She told me she was still

00:24:59,484 --> 00:25:01,453
hearing their voices.

00:25:01,453 --> 00:25:02,921
She wanted...

00:25:02,921 --> 00:25:04,689
to talk to them.

00:25:04,689 --> 00:25:05,757
Well, she's talking

00:25:05,757 --> 00:25:07,726
to them now.

00:25:07,726 --> 00:25:09,461
We need to find out who else

00:25:09,461 --> 00:25:11,730
has been coming here,
bringing all these toys.

00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:14,966
Better bag them up
and get them to Henry.

00:25:24,342 --> 00:25:25,744
What? What is it?

00:25:27,612 --> 00:25:29,481
Her EVP Recorder.

00:25:29,481 --> 00:25:31,349
Must have fallen
when she was struck.

00:25:35,553 --> 00:25:37,522
CARRIE (over recorder):
I'm sorry for all

00:25:37,522 --> 00:25:39,591
the horrible things
that were done to you.

00:25:39,591 --> 00:25:41,993
What can I do
to bring you peace?

00:25:41,993 --> 00:25:44,963
Please, I know you're here.
I can feel you.

00:25:44,963 --> 00:25:46,798
Don't be afraid. Just reach out.

00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:49,000
Talk to me. Give me a sign.

00:25:52,337 --> 00:25:55,473
Funny, kind of looks
like you're...

00:25:55,473 --> 00:25:57,809
waiting to hear an answer.

00:26:00,512 --> 00:26:02,547
You don't know this about me,

00:26:02,547 --> 00:26:04,616
but, uh...

00:26:04,616 --> 00:26:06,785
when I was younger,

00:26:06,785 --> 00:26:08,954
I used to be...

00:26:08,954 --> 00:26:10,455
kind of psychic.

00:26:11,523 --> 00:26:12,757
I know.

00:26:12,757 --> 00:26:15,727
But my grandmother, she had it.

00:26:17,429 --> 00:26:20,598
And I guess I inherited it.

00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,503
(chuckles) Why have I
never heard about this?

00:26:25,503 --> 00:26:27,839
When I became a CSI,

00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:31,309
I felt like I had to choose:

00:26:31,309 --> 00:26:34,279
science or...

00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:36,314
the other.

00:26:36,314 --> 00:26:37,882
I chose science.

00:26:37,882 --> 00:26:41,052
So, now you've
reconsidered?

00:26:41,052 --> 00:26:42,620
Yeah.

00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:45,724
I mean, 'cause of Carrie...

00:26:45,724 --> 00:26:47,492
and what I feel in this place.

00:26:47,492 --> 00:26:51,429
But I-I thought the feelings
came from the infrasound,

00:26:51,429 --> 00:26:53,331
the vibrations from
the ventilation fan.

00:26:53,331 --> 00:26:54,532
Henry turned it off,
and since then,

00:26:54,532 --> 00:26:55,633
I-I don't feel a
thing anymore.

00:26:55,633 --> 00:26:56,735
That's just it.

00:26:56,735 --> 00:26:59,471
<i>I</i> still do.

00:27:01,573 --> 00:27:03,641
CARRIE:
I only want to help you.

00:27:03,641 --> 00:27:06,745
That's all I want,
is for you to have peace.

00:27:06,745 --> 00:27:08,747
Where did you... God, no...

00:27:08,747 --> 00:27:11,416
(metal thuds, clangs)

00:27:11,416 --> 00:27:12,851
(gasps)

00:27:12,851 --> 00:27:15,020
(children laughing)

00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,521
Did you hear that?
Yeah.

00:27:16,521 --> 00:27:17,856
Sounded like laughter.

00:27:17,856 --> 00:27:19,424
Like kids. No, play it again.

00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:20,592
(Carrie screams)

00:27:20,592 --> 00:27:21,893

00:27:29,367 --> 00:27:31,669
know what I know.

00:27:31,669 --> 00:27:34,406
Blinded by the confines
of corporeal reality,

00:27:34,406 --> 00:27:36,574
you're both woefully ignorant

00:27:36,574 --> 00:27:38,376
of what waits on
the other side...

00:27:38,376 --> 00:27:39,677
Got your trial groupie.
Ma'am, that's enough.

00:27:39,677 --> 00:27:41,346
That was quite a ride.

00:27:41,346 --> 00:27:43,348
For you.

00:27:43,348 --> 00:27:45,383
Good luck.

00:27:45,383 --> 00:27:46,651
She's a nutcase.

00:27:46,651 --> 00:27:49,254
Yeah, a nutcase
with blood on her shoes.

00:27:49,254 --> 00:27:51,756
Your shoes
and this shoe print

00:27:51,756 --> 00:27:54,459
that we found
at the murder scene...

00:27:54,459 --> 00:27:55,460
they match.

00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,628
Match, match, three on a match.

00:27:56,628 --> 00:27:57,695
And that's bad luck,

00:27:57,695 --> 00:27:59,330
you know.

00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:00,999
Want to talk
about bad luck?

00:28:00,999 --> 00:28:02,667
You stepped
in a dead woman's blood.

00:28:06,771 --> 00:28:07,872
(chuckles)

00:28:07,872 --> 00:28:10,475

00:28:10,475 --> 00:28:11,476

00:28:11,476 --> 00:28:13,311

00:28:13,311 --> 00:28:14,879

00:28:14,879 --> 00:28:16,681
How wonderful.

00:28:16,681 --> 00:28:19,851
Now, do you remember being
at the slaughterhouse earlier?

00:28:19,851 --> 00:28:22,420
I do.

00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:25,824
I went to talk
to Walter and my boys.

00:28:25,824 --> 00:28:27,258
<i>Your</i> boys?

00:28:27,258 --> 00:28:28,960
Yes, that's what I said--
my boys.

00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,629
My family.

00:28:31,629 --> 00:28:36,301
The family that Walter
created for... us.

00:28:36,301 --> 00:28:38,703
BRASS:
So, when when you
talked to Walter,

00:28:38,703 --> 00:28:40,338
did he tell you to kill Carrie?

00:28:43,942 --> 00:28:45,777
How about Doug?

00:28:47,345 --> 00:28:48,847
(giggles)
BRASS:
Huh?

00:28:48,847 --> 00:28:50,315
I didn't do that.

00:28:50,315 --> 00:28:53,051
But I... I know who did.

00:28:53,051 --> 00:28:54,686
You do?

00:28:54,686 --> 00:28:57,789
He didn't know that
I was there watching.

00:28:57,789 --> 00:28:59,858
Ticktock, like a watch.

00:28:59,858 --> 00:29:01,292
BRASS:
Tell us

00:29:01,292 --> 00:29:02,360
who you saw do this.

00:29:04,629 --> 00:29:06,431
It was one of my boys.

00:29:06,431 --> 00:29:08,867
Mine and Walter's.

00:29:08,867 --> 00:29:10,368
Kids, you know?

00:29:10,368 --> 00:29:11,836
I should probably
have a talk

00:29:11,836 --> 00:29:12,971
with him...

00:29:12,971 --> 00:29:14,906
if you'd like.

00:29:16,341 --> 00:29:18,309
(children laughing)

00:29:20,778 --> 00:29:22,614
Morgan said it was eerie.

00:29:22,614 --> 00:29:23,948
She wasn't lying.

00:29:23,948 --> 00:29:25,416
Yeah.
That came just after

00:29:25,416 --> 00:29:26,417
the killing?

00:29:26,417 --> 00:29:27,418
Yeah.

00:29:27,418 --> 00:29:28,520
But listen.

00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,588
(hiss, children laughing)

00:29:30,588 --> 00:29:32,524
Now, I'm pretty sure

00:29:32,524 --> 00:29:33,658
the laughter's real.

00:29:33,658 --> 00:29:34,792
But it's prerecorded.

00:29:34,792 --> 00:29:36,027
How do you know that?

00:29:36,027 --> 00:29:37,662
Watch the screen
as I play it,

00:29:37,662 --> 00:29:39,330
and I'll freeze
the wave form.

00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:40,765
(metal clangs)

00:29:40,765 --> 00:29:43,735
(hiss, children laughing)

00:29:43,735 --> 00:29:45,570
Now, right there,
just before the laughter,

00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:49,007
there's a high-frequency hiss,
almost, and then it

00:29:49,007 --> 00:29:50,508
dies out immediately after.

00:29:50,508 --> 00:29:53,378
(children laughing, hissing)

00:29:53,378 --> 00:29:55,413
What is it?

00:29:55,413 --> 00:29:57,382
Well, it's got to be the speaker

00:29:57,382 --> 00:29:58,983
on whatever device is playing.

00:29:58,983 --> 00:30:00,652
It powers up

00:30:00,652 --> 00:30:03,488
just a fraction of a second
before the sound comes out.

00:30:03,488 --> 00:30:04,956
So the killer played a recording

00:30:04,956 --> 00:30:06,791
of children laughing
just after the murder?

00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:10,461
That might be even sicker.

DNA analysis on the toys.

00:31:04,749 --> 00:31:05,883
And?

00:31:05,883 --> 00:31:07,318
I found DNA from
a single source

00:31:07,318 --> 00:31:08,720

00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,054
What about the murder weapon?

Same DNA, same as
the rest of the toys.

00:31:11,923 --> 00:31:14,259
Let me guess.

00:31:14,259 --> 00:31:16,661
It belongs to the psycho
groupie, Monica Downs.

00:31:16,661 --> 00:31:17,662
Actually, no.

00:31:17,662 --> 00:31:19,297
The source was an unknown male.

00:31:19,297 --> 00:31:21,566
Suggests that Monica Downs
is not the killer.

00:31:21,566 --> 00:31:23,434
ANDREWS:
It gets stranger.

00:31:23,434 --> 00:31:25,470
Finlay gave me DNA
from the original investigation

00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:26,871
of the Simms murders.

00:31:26,871 --> 00:31:28,773
Cops collected one
sample from Simms' car

00:31:28,773 --> 00:31:30,475
that was never identified.

00:31:30,475 --> 00:31:33,611
Matched the DNA on the toys
and the baseball bat.

00:31:33,611 --> 00:31:36,414
So we're saying the killer
was in Simms' car 20 years ago.

00:31:36,414 --> 00:31:38,416
In the front seat of Simms' car.

00:31:38,416 --> 00:31:40,351
All the DNA
from the boys

00:31:40,351 --> 00:31:41,986
who were killed
came from the back of the car.

00:31:41,986 --> 00:31:43,688
Well, it sounds to me
like we're back

00:31:43,688 --> 00:31:45,556

00:31:45,556 --> 00:31:47,825
Certainly does.

00:31:49,327 --> 00:31:50,728
A male,

00:31:50,728 --> 00:31:52,263
obsessed with the crime,

00:31:52,263 --> 00:31:53,564
enough knowledge of the details

00:31:53,564 --> 00:31:54,899
to be able
to re-create them perfectly.

00:31:56,034 --> 00:31:57,669

00:32:03,741 --> 00:32:06,344
Yeah.

00:32:07,879 --> 00:32:09,013
and rub our faces in it.

00:32:18,323 --> 00:32:20,725
Well, his alibi checks out.

00:32:20,725 --> 00:32:22,327
He said he was at
a book signing,

00:32:22,327 --> 00:32:23,628
he was at a book signing.

00:32:23,628 --> 00:32:25,763
What about the DNA?
Sent it to Henry,

00:32:25,763 --> 00:32:28,299
but I'm afraid it's only
gonna confirm that...

00:32:28,299 --> 00:32:29,801
he's not our guy.

00:32:29,801 --> 00:32:32,370
Oh, hell.

00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:33,738
Well...

00:32:33,738 --> 00:32:35,606
(both sigh)

00:32:35,606 --> 00:32:37,642
I still like our theory.

00:32:37,642 --> 00:32:39,844
Looking for the old accomplice
in the current murders?

00:32:39,844 --> 00:32:41,646
I mean, we know he's a male.

00:32:41,646 --> 00:32:43,915
We know he was
in Simms's car 20 years ago.

00:32:43,915 --> 00:32:46,517
What we don't know
is where he is now.

00:32:46,517 --> 00:32:48,386
Exactly.

00:32:48,386 --> 00:32:50,021
All right, just-just play
with me for a second.

00:32:50,021 --> 00:32:54,392
Monica Downs said that she saw
Carrie's killer, right?

00:32:54,392 --> 00:32:55,626
That it was one of the boys.

00:32:55,626 --> 00:32:56,661
Monica Downs is crazy.

00:32:56,661 --> 00:32:58,262
The boys are dead.

00:32:58,262 --> 00:33:00,031
All right, all right,
but what if they're not?

00:33:00,031 --> 00:33:03,000
Russell, the cops
found all seven bodies.

00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,269
What if there was
an eighth?
(sighs)

00:33:05,269 --> 00:33:08,673
What-what if... what if Simms
abducted an eighth boy

00:33:08,673 --> 00:33:11,309
and forced him
to be his accomplice?

00:33:11,309 --> 00:33:14,379
Cops finally catch up
with Simms and put him in jail,

00:33:14,379 --> 00:33:15,847
boy runs away.

00:33:15,847 --> 00:33:17,648
Which means he might
still be out there.

00:33:23,421 --> 00:33:25,390
(clears throat)
What are those?

00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:27,458
Missing persons reports
from 20 years ago.

00:33:27,458 --> 00:33:29,460
When Simms was
snatching up kids.
Yeah.

00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,529
I found three other boys
that disappeared within

00:33:31,529 --> 00:33:33,631
that timeframe
who were never accounted for.

00:33:33,631 --> 00:33:35,800
Well, only one of them
has a photo.

00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,835
Yeah, as far
as the other two go--

00:33:37,835 --> 00:33:39,704
uh, Brian Oden grew up
on the streets.

00:33:39,704 --> 00:33:41,806
There were quite a few homeless
that reported him missing.

00:33:41,806 --> 00:33:43,775
And Jonathan Harris
grew up in foster care.

00:33:43,775 --> 00:33:46,010
Everybody just thought
he ran away,

00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:48,413
including PD.

of these could be

00:33:48,413 --> 00:33:50,515
Simms' eighth victim,
our so-called accomplice.

00:33:50,515 --> 00:33:52,049

Okay, his DNA is in there.

00:33:56,421 --> 00:33:57,855
He must have left prints.

00:33:57,855 --> 00:33:59,924
But PD ran the prints
20 years ago.

00:33:59,924 --> 00:34:02,493
Yeah, but he was a juvenile,
so he wasn't in the system.

00:34:02,493 --> 00:34:04,762
You're right.
Got to be over 30 by now.

00:34:04,762 --> 00:34:05,863
Maybe that's changed.

just tell them I had to
step out a little while.

I don't know.
Maybe nothing.

00:34:30,021 --> 00:34:32,990
Or maybe I'll be able
to reach out to Carrie,

00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:34,926
and with her help,
maybe to the boys.

00:34:34,926 --> 00:34:36,627

the property.

00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:52,637
Thanks again for coming
down to let me in.

00:35:52,637 --> 00:35:54,505
I really appreciate it.

00:35:54,505 --> 00:35:55,840
No problem.

00:35:59,877 --> 00:36:01,812
(door creaking)

00:36:03,314 --> 00:36:05,650
After you.

00:36:18,663 --> 00:36:22,266
You know, in a couple of days,
this whole place will be gone.

00:36:22,266 --> 00:36:25,336
Bulldozed
to the ground.

00:36:25,336 --> 00:36:26,938
The building,

00:36:26,938 --> 00:36:28,606
everything inside.

00:36:28,606 --> 00:36:31,542
What were you
hoping to find?

00:36:31,542 --> 00:36:33,778
(sighs)

00:36:33,778 --> 00:36:36,314
I don't really know.

00:36:45,957 --> 00:36:48,392
Well, but you're here.

00:36:49,694 --> 00:36:51,662
Right?

00:36:51,662 --> 00:36:53,798
You must have some idea.

00:37:16,754 --> 00:37:19,290
You want to talk
to them, don't you?

00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:22,693
(children laughing)

00:37:22,693 --> 00:37:25,296
Sorry. It's, uh,
my kids' ringtone.

00:37:25,296 --> 00:37:28,399
It's my wife calling.

00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:34,505
Don't.

00:37:36,974 --> 00:37:38,876
Just drop it!

00:37:40,011 --> 00:37:42,780
Haven't enough people died here?

00:37:50,454 --> 00:37:53,491
BRASS:
<i>Thomas Pope-- family man,</i>

00:37:53,491 --> 00:37:55,960
wife and kids, good job,

00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:59,430
an education, but that's only
half of who you really are.

00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:00,431
See, Thomas Pope
is an invention.

00:38:00,431 --> 00:38:01,899
You made it up.

00:38:01,899 --> 00:38:04,368
He doesn't exist before
about 12 years ago.

00:38:04,368 --> 00:38:06,737
Your real name is
Jonathan Harris, isn't it?

00:38:06,737 --> 00:38:08,873
When you grew up,
you were passed

00:38:08,873 --> 00:38:10,808
from one foster
home to another

00:38:10,808 --> 00:38:12,910
until one day
your luck really went bad

00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:14,912
and you were abducted

00:38:14,912 --> 00:38:16,414
by Walter Simms.

00:38:16,414 --> 00:38:18,416
No, you're wrong.
You're mistaken.

00:38:18,416 --> 00:38:20,384
Well, we found your DNA
in Walter Simms' car,

00:38:20,384 --> 00:38:21,852
along with your fingerprints.

00:38:21,852 --> 00:38:24,789
We're not wrong, Jonathan.
We know who you are.

00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:27,892
I am not Jonathan.

00:38:27,892 --> 00:38:31,896
I am not that damaged
little boy, not anymore.

00:38:34,298 --> 00:38:37,802
I know you feel responsible
for those other boys,

00:38:37,802 --> 00:38:39,837
the ones who were killed.

00:38:39,837 --> 00:38:41,806
Isn't that why

00:38:41,806 --> 00:38:43,708
you still bring them toys?

00:38:43,708 --> 00:38:46,744
You were 11 years old.

00:38:46,744 --> 00:38:48,646
You were a little boy yourself.

00:38:48,646 --> 00:38:50,347
It wasn't your fault.

00:38:50,347 --> 00:38:53,317
But they won't let me forget.

00:38:53,317 --> 00:38:55,386
They blame me.

00:38:55,386 --> 00:38:57,354
They torment me.

00:38:57,354 --> 00:38:59,356
And I can't make
the voices go away.

00:38:59,356 --> 00:39:01,358
You were there.

00:39:01,358 --> 00:39:02,793
You had to have felt them.

00:39:04,795 --> 00:39:07,798
Tell us about the ghost
hunters, Doug and Carrie.

00:39:10,501 --> 00:39:12,603
I didn't want them inside.

00:39:12,603 --> 00:39:15,473
I tried to tell my boss
that it was a bad idea.

00:39:15,473 --> 00:39:17,274
Why was it a bad idea?

00:39:17,274 --> 00:39:18,876
Because I knew
what would happen.

00:39:18,876 --> 00:39:21,512
I knew that they
would learn my secret.

00:39:21,512 --> 00:39:24,348
I have worked very hard

00:39:24,348 --> 00:39:26,784
to get past everything
that has happened

00:39:26,784 --> 00:39:28,986
and build a new life.

00:39:28,986 --> 00:39:31,722
If they found out,

00:39:31,722 --> 00:39:33,924
I would lose everything,

00:39:33,924 --> 00:39:35,760
everything that I have

00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,863
built as Thomas Pope.

00:39:38,863 --> 00:39:40,698
But I-I mean,
how are they gonna find out?

00:39:40,698 --> 00:39:41,832
Who's gonna tell them?

00:39:41,832 --> 00:39:43,934
From talking to the boys.

00:39:43,934 --> 00:39:46,437
The <i>ghosts</i> of the boys?

00:39:46,437 --> 00:39:49,373
I couldn't let them talk
to the boys.

00:39:54,478 --> 00:39:55,880
Hey.

00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,448
Hey.

00:39:57,448 --> 00:39:58,616
Do you have a minute?

00:39:58,616 --> 00:39:59,917
I do.

00:40:01,886 --> 00:40:04,722
Uh... back before
I came to Vegas,

00:40:04,722 --> 00:40:06,724
I worked up in San Francisco.

00:40:06,724 --> 00:40:09,960
I helped put away this
guy-- true sociopath.

00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,862
He posed as a cop,

00:40:11,862 --> 00:40:14,365
pull women over at night,
sadistically assault them.

00:40:14,365 --> 00:40:16,467
We found 17 victims.

00:40:16,467 --> 00:40:17,902
I suspect there were more.

00:40:17,902 --> 00:40:19,804
You're talking
about Lyle Brinks, right?

00:40:19,804 --> 00:40:20,905
Yeah.
I had no idea

00:40:20,905 --> 00:40:22,339
you were a part of that.

00:40:24,041 --> 00:40:25,776
He's up for parole.

00:40:25,776 --> 00:40:27,978
The cop that I worked
with-- she's worried that

00:40:27,978 --> 00:40:31,615
he actually stands a chance
of release.

00:40:31,615 --> 00:40:33,551
Okay. What can I do?

00:40:33,551 --> 00:40:34,885
I need a few days.

00:40:34,885 --> 00:40:36,654
I-I... I want to be there.

00:40:36,654 --> 00:40:39,723
I want to testify,
make sure that doesn't happen.

00:40:39,723 --> 00:40:42,860
I understand.
You got it... but,

00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:45,396
you know, while you're
up there, do me a favor.

00:40:45,396 --> 00:40:46,897
You know, take some time off.

00:40:46,897 --> 00:40:48,933
It's been a rough
couple of months.

00:40:48,933 --> 00:40:50,668
You deserve it.

00:40:50,668 --> 00:40:53,304
(laughs)

00:40:53,304 --> 00:40:55,506
Okay.

00:40:55,506 --> 00:40:57,808
Hey.

00:40:57,808 --> 00:40:59,844
Great job today.

00:40:59,844 --> 00:41:02,913
That must have been
really scary.

00:41:02,913 --> 00:41:05,683
I'll tell you,
when I heard that laughing,

00:41:05,683 --> 00:41:07,852
I sure as hell wasn't laughing.

00:41:07,852 --> 00:41:09,753
(laughs)

00:41:09,753 --> 00:41:12,890
You know, I... I think I owe you
an apology from earlier,

00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:15,559
implying that you
were crazy.

00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:17,962
You know, as much
as this is our universe,

00:41:17,962 --> 00:41:19,997
surrounded by science every day,

00:41:19,997 --> 00:41:21,632
I still like to think

00:41:21,632 --> 00:41:23,667
there's room
for a spiritual side.

00:41:23,667 --> 00:41:26,270
Well, no apology necessary,

00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:28,505
but it's accepted.

00:41:28,505 --> 00:41:30,374
Thank you.
But who knows?
I mean,

00:41:30,374 --> 00:41:31,675
maybe you're right.

00:41:31,675 --> 00:41:32,877
Maybe this whole
thing is crazy.

00:41:32,877 --> 00:41:34,845
What? Why you saying that now?

00:41:34,845 --> 00:41:36,413
Well,

00:41:36,413 --> 00:41:38,949
when I was at the slaughterhouse
with Pope,

00:41:38,949 --> 00:41:41,585
I was doing everything I could

00:41:41,585 --> 00:41:45,022
to hear or feel anything
from Carrie

00:41:45,022 --> 00:41:47,958
or the boys, and
I mean, there I was

00:41:47,958 --> 00:41:49,693
with the killer standing
right behind me,

00:41:49,693 --> 00:41:52,029
and none of them bothered
to send up a signal,

00:41:52,029 --> 00:41:53,631
or a-a single
ghostly warning sign?

00:41:53,631 --> 00:41:54,865
(laughing):
Yeah.

00:41:54,865 --> 00:41:56,333
Yeah, you would think, right?

00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:02,406
But I think...

00:42:02,406 --> 00:42:05,609
someone was looking out for you.

00:42:05,609 --> 00:42:08,479
You made it out of there okay.

00:42:08,479 --> 00:42:10,948
(sighs)

00:42:10,948 --> 00:42:12,850
Let me buy you breakfast.

00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:15,552
Deal.

00:42:15,552 --> 00:42:17,421
But I'm driving.

00:42:17,421 --> 00:42:19,356
Of course you are.

00:42:29,466 --> 00:42:31,568
Let's go.

00:42:31,568 --> 00:42:32,903
(locker door creaking)
