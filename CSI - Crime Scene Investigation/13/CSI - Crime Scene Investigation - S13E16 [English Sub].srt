Palermo Poker Classic.

Nope.

woman on the second floor

rang the elevator,
dying guy answered.

00:01:46,059 --> 00:01:48,928

Yeah. Go figure.

Well, it's saying
that our victim

00:01:54,968 --> 00:01:56,703
didn't suffer for too long.

00:01:56,703 --> 00:01:59,506
Spirting pattern suggests

BRODY:
Question is,

00:02:03,677 --> 00:02:05,745
who caused the bloodshed?

00:02:05,745 --> 00:02:07,747
Yeah. And how'd
the suspect get in?

00:02:07,747 --> 00:02:09,949

Well, we're missing something.

00:02:46,052 --> 00:02:47,954
I checked Coe's wallet;
nothing is missing.

00:02:47,954 --> 00:02:49,723

Maybe we'll find trace
of the blade alloy.

00:03:45,745 --> 00:03:48,548
Speaking of alloys,
our victim was wearing

this metal bracelet.

00:03:52,685 --> 00:03:55,789
"PPC 1997 Champion."

Same tournament he lost at
last night.

00:03:59,826 --> 00:04:04,531
In '97, he won the main event--
a million bucks.

00:04:04,531 --> 00:04:06,533
I looked it up.
Morgan looked up

00:04:06,533 --> 00:04:07,934
Coe's financial history.

00:04:07,934 --> 00:04:10,003
The guy was
completely broke.

00:04:10,003 --> 00:04:13,106
I think I can tell you what he
spent his million on--his face.

00:04:13,106 --> 00:04:15,441
He's had extensive dermal
filling of the forehead,

00:04:15,441 --> 00:04:17,777
massive injections
of Botox.

00:04:17,777 --> 00:04:20,547
I also found numerous
scalpel scars

00:04:20,547 --> 00:04:23,583
along his lower eyelid,
ear and mouth.

00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:26,219
So our man was vain.
Our man was trying
to win again.

00:04:26,219 --> 00:04:29,689
He had a plastic surgery
procedure called Poker Lift.

Twice on my table this year.

00:04:44,137 --> 00:04:45,939
Vegas.

00:04:45,939 --> 00:04:47,907
This didn't help
his game, either.

00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:51,845
Powdery substance
on his shirt.

00:04:51,845 --> 00:04:53,513
Cocaine?

00:04:53,513 --> 00:04:55,548
Could be.
All right, I'll rush
it up to Hodges.

indistinct police radio chatter)

00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,898

00:05:11,898 --> 00:05:13,032

00:05:13,032 --> 00:05:14,601
All good.

00:05:14,601 --> 00:05:15,635
Right on.

00:05:15,635 --> 00:05:17,036
I, uh, got a
name for us.

00:05:17,036 --> 00:05:18,504
Trent Aldridge.
He's local.

00:05:18,504 --> 00:05:20,540
Checked in alone
at midnight.

00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,208
He may have checked in alone,
but he definitely

00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:24,777
had some company
in here.
Wrists and ankles

00:05:24,777 --> 00:05:26,946
are bound to
the bedposts.

00:05:26,946 --> 00:05:30,149
Dinner with a side of S&amp;M?

00:05:30,149 --> 00:05:31,618
His face looks

00:05:31,618 --> 00:05:34,621
all contorted, like
he was gasping for air.

00:05:34,621 --> 00:05:36,489
Liver temp was 94.1,

00:05:36,489 --> 00:05:38,992
so he's been dead
about three hours.

00:05:38,992 --> 00:05:41,194
Hey, man, is there
something in his mouth?

00:05:41,194 --> 00:05:44,731
His throat looks obstructed.
Check that out.

00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,768
Yeah. Asphyxiation.

00:05:48,768 --> 00:05:50,470
Could be our C.O.D.

00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:52,005
Eh, it's loose.

00:05:52,005 --> 00:05:54,674
Could come out in transport;
I'd better grab it now.

00:05:54,674 --> 00:05:56,042
Yeah, man, get it
out of there.

00:05:59,779 --> 00:06:01,748
STOKES:
Ugh!

00:06:01,748 --> 00:06:04,117
What the hell is that,
a piece of meat?

00:06:04,117 --> 00:06:05,551
Looks like a piece of raw meat.

00:06:05,551 --> 00:06:06,853
Maybe it was part of
the sex games--

00:06:06,853 --> 00:06:09,088
servant behaves,
gets a treat.

00:06:09,088 --> 00:06:10,857
(sultry laugh)
Here you go, baby.
Ah...

00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:15,528
(grunting, choking)

00:06:15,528 --> 00:06:18,197
Oh, 50 Shades of Gross.
It's kind of hard

00:06:18,197 --> 00:06:20,934
to scream the safe word
when you're choking to death.

00:06:22,435 --> 00:06:24,437
FINLAY:
Hey.

00:06:24,437 --> 00:06:27,573
You shouldn't have.
Oh, I didn't.
The trace

00:06:27,573 --> 00:06:30,610
on our elevator victim's shirt
was not cocaine,

00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:31,744
it was pollen.

00:06:31,744 --> 00:06:34,948
From a white lily.
Which tells us...?

00:06:34,948 --> 00:06:36,649
We were looking for
Coe's mystery woman.

00:06:36,649 --> 00:06:39,052
Well, he was coming
from a poker tournament,

00:06:39,052 --> 00:06:41,120
so I figured that she
was a player as well.

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,689
Good theory.

00:06:42,689 --> 00:06:44,524
It's a great theory.
It turns out that

00:06:44,524 --> 00:06:46,559
she's the only woman left
in the tournament.

00:06:46,559 --> 00:06:49,429
They gave her an award
for it--hence, the flower.

00:06:49,429 --> 00:06:52,165
"Last Woman Standing."

00:06:52,165 --> 00:06:53,900
RUSSELL:
Mildly condescending.

00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,735
Yeah, really.
The desk guy

00:06:55,735 --> 00:06:58,938
at Peter Coe's condo
I.D.'d her as Ava Rendell.

00:06:58,938 --> 00:07:01,107
She has her
own Web site.

00:07:01,107 --> 00:07:03,876
She gives lessons,
sells T-shirts.

00:07:03,876 --> 00:07:05,878
Hotpokerbabe.com.

00:07:05,878 --> 00:07:07,447
Classy.

00:07:07,447 --> 00:07:10,083
She's actually a Harvard
Business School grad.

00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:11,617
Guess she knows
what sells.

00:07:11,617 --> 00:07:14,487
Poker Babe is in the finals,
playing as we speak.

00:07:14,487 --> 00:07:17,657
The key to poker is finding out
your opponent's tells,

00:07:17,657 --> 00:07:19,125

00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:22,028

00:08:10,209 --> 00:08:11,878

you've been identified

00:08:22,055 --> 00:08:23,990
as the last person
to see Peter Coe alive.

00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:27,527
AVA:
Yeah, I was...I was with Pete.

00:08:27,527 --> 00:08:28,728
I still can't believe

00:08:28,728 --> 00:08:30,763
this happened.
You said it was a mugging?

00:08:30,763 --> 00:08:33,766
We haven't made
any determinations.

00:08:33,766 --> 00:08:36,202
You have a good poker face.

00:08:36,202 --> 00:08:38,805
So, did you see
anything suspicious

00:08:38,805 --> 00:08:40,039
in the lobby?

00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:42,175
It was empty;
just a front desk guy.

00:08:42,175 --> 00:08:43,976
We know that Pete was...

00:08:43,976 --> 00:08:46,112
let's just say, low on cash.

00:08:46,112 --> 00:08:48,781
He was in debt to half the town.
SANDERS: So do you
know anyone

00:08:48,781 --> 00:08:51,117
who...might have wanted
to come collect?

00:08:51,117 --> 00:08:55,188
No...no, I was just there
to see him home safe.

00:08:55,188 --> 00:08:56,656
How ironic is that.

00:08:56,656 --> 00:08:58,524
So you two weren't an item?

00:08:58,524 --> 00:09:01,461
God, no. No, Pete
was like an uncle to me.

00:09:01,461 --> 00:09:03,663
He was a regular
at my dad's poker table.

00:09:03,663 --> 00:09:06,032
My dad was a dealer
at the Palermo for 30 years.

00:09:06,032 --> 00:09:07,800

Yep.

00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,769
Police work in yours?

00:09:09,769 --> 00:09:11,571
My dad's a CSI.

00:09:11,571 --> 00:09:13,139
Well, he must be proud.

00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:15,074
Although I imagine
it's just as much

00:09:15,074 --> 00:09:17,143
of a boys' club as poker.
Not quite.

00:09:17,143 --> 00:09:19,579
SANDERS:
So, did Pete get along

00:09:19,579 --> 00:09:20,913
with all of the other players?

00:09:20,913 --> 00:09:23,216
Pete was a legend. Loved.

00:09:23,216 --> 00:09:26,586
He had his problems,
but he didn't deserve this.

00:09:26,586 --> 00:09:29,021
Well, thank you
for your time.

00:09:29,021 --> 00:09:30,756
Tough loss today.

00:09:30,756 --> 00:09:32,792
I should've known
when he dogged it on the turn

00:09:32,792 --> 00:09:33,960
that he had a flush.

00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,761
Should've
seen it coming.

00:09:35,761 --> 00:09:36,896
Slow-played me.

00:09:39,632 --> 00:09:40,800
SIDLE:
<i>Our S&amp;M victim's room</i>

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,034
at the Palermo
was wiped down,

00:09:42,034 --> 00:09:43,469
but I found the
room service guy.

00:09:43,469 --> 00:09:46,005
Our dominatrix
left him a tip.

00:09:46,005 --> 00:09:47,507
Did he give you
a description?

00:09:47,507 --> 00:09:49,709
He never saw her.
She was in the bathroom.

00:09:49,709 --> 00:09:51,043
She just put her
hand out the door

00:09:51,043 --> 00:09:52,778
and gave him a
hundred-dollar poker chip.

00:09:52,778 --> 00:09:55,515
Maybe we'll
get a print.
Okay. Thank you.

00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,719
Hey.

00:09:59,719 --> 00:10:01,854
What do we got on
our elevator victim, anything?

00:10:01,854 --> 00:10:03,456
I ran trace on
the neck wound.

00:10:03,456 --> 00:10:04,991
I didn't find
any metal alloy.

00:10:04,991 --> 00:10:06,993
I found cellulose acetate.

00:10:06,993 --> 00:10:09,495
We're looking
for a plastic knife?

00:10:09,495 --> 00:10:12,999
Or something less... picnic-y?

00:10:12,999 --> 00:10:14,534
Okay. Well, I guess you
just round up

00:10:14,534 --> 00:10:16,669
the usual plastic
instruments of death

00:10:16,669 --> 00:10:18,104
and see if we
can get a match.

00:10:18,104 --> 00:10:21,040
♪ ♪

00:10:53,472 --> 00:10:55,007
Really?

00:10:55,007 --> 00:10:57,043
You think a plastic boomerang
is our murder weapon?

00:10:57,043 --> 00:11:00,680
No. We're looking
for cellulose acetate.

00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:04,150
The boomerang gave us trace
of polypropylene.

00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:06,485
Not a match.

00:11:06,485 --> 00:11:08,187
Oh...
Ceramic knife.

00:11:08,187 --> 00:11:11,657
Zirconium dioxide.
Not a match.

00:11:11,657 --> 00:11:13,159
Plastic plates.

00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:15,928
Acrylonitrite butadiene styrene.

00:11:15,928 --> 00:11:17,196
Ditto.

00:11:17,196 --> 00:11:19,198
(plates clatter)

00:11:19,198 --> 00:11:21,167
Rulers...
Okay, I got it.

00:11:21,167 --> 00:11:23,936
You struck out, and you lost
your mind in the process.

00:11:23,936 --> 00:11:25,471
Struck out?

00:11:25,471 --> 00:11:27,540
Hmm. On the contrary.

00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,642
You mean you found something?
I believe so.

00:11:29,642 --> 00:11:31,444
And I arrived at the conclusion

00:11:31,444 --> 00:11:34,814
by venturing outside
the box--literally.

00:11:34,814 --> 00:11:37,683
Walk with me.

00:11:37,683 --> 00:11:39,652
I think we've been looking
at our elevator murder

00:11:39,652 --> 00:11:43,122
the wrong way--we assume
that the killer broke in,

00:11:43,122 --> 00:11:45,858
most likely through
the ceiling hatch.

00:11:45,858 --> 00:11:47,059
(elevator bell dings)

00:11:49,962 --> 00:11:52,431
It's the only way in.

00:11:52,431 --> 00:11:54,200
Is it?

00:11:56,068 --> 00:11:57,970
A locked room has to be open
at some point.

00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:00,840
Yeah, when the-the door's open.
Exactly.

00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,775
Which is why I think
our killer did the deed

00:12:02,775 --> 00:12:05,945
before the locked room
became locked.
No, but witnesses said

00:12:05,945 --> 00:12:08,948
that no one got
on the elevator with Coe.
<i>Precisamente.</i>

00:12:08,948 --> 00:12:11,050
The killer might not have
gotten onto the elevator,

00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,985
but I think that the
murder weapon did.

00:12:15,488 --> 00:12:17,757
Abracadabra.
What are you doing?

00:12:17,757 --> 00:12:20,426
A plastic-coated playing
card explains all.

00:12:20,426 --> 00:12:23,496
In the right hands, a playing
card is a lethal weapon.

00:12:23,496 --> 00:12:25,197
Thrown up to
80 miles per hour.

00:12:25,197 --> 00:12:28,100
I once watched a magician slice
a carrot in half with one.

00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,570
So you're suggesting that
our killer threw a playing card

00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:33,572
like a ninja star.

00:12:33,572 --> 00:12:36,442
And that's how he killed
our victim.

00:12:36,442 --> 00:12:39,145
Are you nuts?
Th-That's absolutely absurd.

00:12:39,145 --> 00:12:41,614
Well, that's what the
evidence suggests.

00:12:41,614 --> 00:12:43,015
(elevator bell chimes)
Okay...

00:12:43,015 --> 00:12:44,717
Let's go back to
that night, shall we?

00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:47,019
AVA:
Sorry...

00:12:47,019 --> 00:12:48,554
HODGES:
I'm the killer.

00:12:48,554 --> 00:12:50,056
I've sneaked into
Peter Coe's apartment.

00:12:50,056 --> 00:12:52,925
AVA:
There's always next year.

00:12:52,925 --> 00:12:54,860
COE: Doesn't mean
it's gonna be a <i>good</i> year.

00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,562
Good night, Brad.

00:12:58,464 --> 00:13:01,067
Coe gets shot down.
Ava splits.

00:13:03,035 --> 00:13:04,670
I step into a side hallway,

00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:07,540
so that the front
desk guy can't see me.

00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,742
I watch Coe walk
to the elevator.

00:13:09,742 --> 00:13:10,743
(elevator bell dings)

00:13:10,743 --> 00:13:11,677
I wait for him to get on.

00:13:13,746 --> 00:13:15,214
Make sure the
coast is clear.

00:13:17,483 --> 00:13:18,517
Take aim,

00:13:18,517 --> 00:13:20,119
and just before the doors close,

00:13:20,119 --> 00:13:22,121
fire.

00:13:22,121 --> 00:13:23,556
(gagging)

00:13:27,893 --> 00:13:30,796
A playing card would explain how
our murder weapon disappeared.

00:13:30,796 --> 00:13:32,765
Thin enough...
To fall through the gap.

00:13:32,765 --> 00:13:35,835
I measured--gap is only
ten millimeters wide.

00:13:35,835 --> 00:13:37,636
Playing card?

00:13:37,636 --> 00:13:38,971
Less than one millimeter.

00:13:38,971 --> 00:13:41,774
It's plenty of room.

00:13:41,774 --> 00:13:45,811
It's a cool theory.
(chuckles)

00:13:45,811 --> 00:13:47,546
You definitely ventured
outside the box.

00:13:47,546 --> 00:13:48,981
Possibly to
another planet.

00:13:48,981 --> 00:13:50,649
But can you prove it?
I sent Henry

00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:52,651
to the primary to see
if he could collect a card

00:13:52,651 --> 00:13:54,653
from the elevator shaft floor.

00:13:54,653 --> 00:13:56,455
Oh, how did Henry feel
about that?

00:13:56,455 --> 00:13:57,857
He was very happy
for the opportunity.

00:13:59,024 --> 00:14:00,793
Hey. I just got back.

00:14:00,793 --> 00:14:03,062
Okay, I did not plan that.

00:14:03,062 --> 00:14:05,798
Any luck?
I admit, I was a skeptic.

00:14:05,798 --> 00:14:08,467
But...
Please don't say "abracadabra."

00:14:08,467 --> 00:14:10,703
Okay.

00:14:10,703 --> 00:14:13,072
Found it
in the elevator shaft.

00:14:13,072 --> 00:14:14,673
You have got to be kidding me.

00:14:14,673 --> 00:14:15,808
ANDREWS:
I pheno-ed it.

00:14:15,808 --> 00:14:17,042
Positive for blood.

00:14:17,042 --> 00:14:18,644
I'll say it.

00:14:18,644 --> 00:14:20,513
Abracadabra?
No.

00:14:20,513 --> 00:14:22,448
We found our murder weapon.

00:14:26,152 --> 00:14:29,655
WOMAN:
Let me go! Please, no!

00:14:29,655 --> 00:14:32,758
Let me go! Please!

00:14:32,758 --> 00:14:33,759

00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:34,760
MAN:
Be still.

00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,929
No, let me go!

00:14:36,929 --> 00:14:38,164
Please!

00:14:38,164 --> 00:14:41,834

00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,841
Do you think this is funny?

00:14:48,841 --> 00:14:51,510
(giggles)
It tickles.

00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:52,711
Lights!

00:14:52,711 --> 00:14:54,046
It tickles?

00:14:54,046 --> 00:14:55,648
I just slit your throat!

00:14:55,648 --> 00:14:57,950
You split it ten times
already today, Jimmy.

00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:59,919
How good do you want it?

00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:01,854
Good is for gillygaupus
and balloon acts.

00:15:01,854 --> 00:15:03,422
I need perfection!

00:15:03,422 --> 00:15:05,558
And I need a break.

00:15:06,659 --> 00:15:08,561
Come back scared.

00:15:08,561 --> 00:15:09,962
With jectigation.

00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:15,935
Carl! Who let these plebs in?

00:15:15,935 --> 00:15:17,837
I told you,

00:15:17,837 --> 00:15:19,638
no visitors, no exceptions!

00:15:19,638 --> 00:15:21,173
James Nefarro,
Las Vegas Police.

00:15:24,743 --> 00:15:26,579
I prefer "Dr. Jimmy," actually.

00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:27,980
Okay--Dr. Jimmy.

00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,215
We need to talk.

00:15:29,215 --> 00:15:30,883
BRASS:
<i>So, some friends of mine</i>

00:15:30,883 --> 00:15:33,853
at the Palermo Poker Tournament
told me that, uh...

00:15:33,853 --> 00:15:37,056
that you staked Peter Coe
ten grand to play.

00:15:37,056 --> 00:15:38,057
How much did you get back?

00:15:38,057 --> 00:15:39,658
Not one centime.

00:15:39,658 --> 00:15:41,794
Especially now
he's met with bangstry.

00:15:41,794 --> 00:15:43,996
Whatever that means.

00:15:43,996 --> 00:15:46,799
Where were you
last night?
Why?

00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:48,868
You think I had something
to do with Peter's untimely

00:15:48,868 --> 00:15:51,070
shuffle off this mortal coil?
BRODY:
The murder weapon

00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:52,872
pretty much puts you
at the top of the list.

00:15:55,474 --> 00:15:56,876
What, is this real?

00:15:56,876 --> 00:15:57,877
It's not a trick.

00:16:00,479 --> 00:16:02,147
So, where were you?

00:16:02,147 --> 00:16:04,116
I was here.

00:16:04,116 --> 00:16:05,718
Rehearsing, wasn't I?

00:16:05,718 --> 00:16:08,153
And someone can verify that?
No, I was alone.

00:16:08,153 --> 00:16:09,889
Come on, you can do
better than that, Jimmy.

00:16:09,889 --> 00:16:11,557
Peter Coe was a mate.

00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:15,594
We played together--
Texas Hold 'Em

00:16:15,594 --> 00:16:18,030
before it was spoiled
by frat boys and gongoozlers.

00:16:19,698 --> 00:16:21,867
I'd never hurt him.
BRODY:
I'm afraid

00:16:21,867 --> 00:16:23,903
I'm gonna have to take a look
at your playing cards.

00:16:23,903 --> 00:16:25,504
Ah, I see. Well...

00:16:25,504 --> 00:16:28,974
a prestidigitator
never reveals his secrets.

00:16:28,974 --> 00:16:31,710
Okay. So, how about...

00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:33,145
I reveal...

00:16:33,145 --> 00:16:35,147
a search warrant?

Cuff him.
You're under arrest

00:16:50,529 --> 00:16:52,164
for obstruction of justice,

Have you I.D.'d
the mystery meat?

00:17:04,209 --> 00:17:08,147
According to Hodges, the meat
inside our S&amp;M victim's throat

00:17:08,147 --> 00:17:09,648
is a...

00:17:09,648 --> 00:17:11,584
raw chicken heart.

that is not your usual
room service order.

00:17:15,154 --> 00:17:18,724
So far, I found three
chicken hearts in the stomach

00:17:18,724 --> 00:17:20,693
and two in a row
in the trachea.

00:17:20,693 --> 00:17:23,062
Think he was trying to swallow
but couldn't get 'em down.

00:17:23,062 --> 00:17:25,130
So he suffered.

00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:27,199
Well, I think the suffering
was intentional.

00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,971
I see cuts and abrasions along
the trachea, there and there.

00:17:31,971 --> 00:17:33,539
What would cause that?

00:17:33,539 --> 00:17:36,442
Ring-shaped injury
on the epiglottis,

00:17:36,442 --> 00:17:39,578
hypothyroid

00:17:39,578 --> 00:17:41,714

00:17:47,219 --> 00:17:48,721
By seven hearts.

00:17:51,423 --> 00:17:54,026
FINLAY:
Okay...seven...

00:17:54,026 --> 00:17:57,696
hearts, as in seven <i>of</i> hearts.

00:17:57,696 --> 00:17:59,098
You mean like a playing card.
Yeah.

00:17:59,098 --> 00:18:01,700
We just found the ace of spades.

00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,636
This can't be a coincidence.

00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:06,839
BRODY:
<i>Sheriff acceptance letter.</i>

00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:09,041
You still haven't signed it.

00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:10,809
I wanted your thoughts.

00:18:13,479 --> 00:18:15,914
They would be lucky to have you.

00:18:15,914 --> 00:18:17,883
There is no one more qualified.

00:18:17,883 --> 00:18:20,452
Sheriff's Office,
it's political.

00:18:20,452 --> 00:18:22,755
It...supervisory.

00:18:22,755 --> 00:18:24,723
Again, no one more qualified.

00:18:24,723 --> 00:18:27,526
I mean, you ran the number-one
crime lab in the country.

00:18:27,526 --> 00:18:30,062
Yeah, and I was a demanding,
manipulative...

00:18:30,062 --> 00:18:31,563
piece of garbage.

00:18:34,466 --> 00:18:36,702
You don't have to be
that person again.
People can change

00:18:36,702 --> 00:18:38,804
for the better, but who says
they can't change back?

00:18:38,804 --> 00:18:40,806
I do.

00:18:42,608 --> 00:18:44,743
Still...why take the risk?

00:18:44,743 --> 00:18:48,514
Hey, I mean...I took a risk.

00:18:48,514 --> 00:18:49,948
Coming here.

00:18:49,948 --> 00:18:51,450
I had so much anger

00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:53,152
a-and rage toward you;
it fueled me,

00:18:53,152 --> 00:18:54,953
but I...now...

00:18:57,589 --> 00:18:59,591
(chuckles)

00:18:59,591 --> 00:19:01,560
Older and wiser, huh?

00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,495
I'm not that much older.

00:19:05,464 --> 00:19:06,665
But a lot wiser.

00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,968
I'm not going anywhere, Dad.

00:19:11,837 --> 00:19:14,139
No matter what.

00:19:14,139 --> 00:19:16,809
STOKES:
<i>Finn's theory</i> about the seven
of hearts wasn't so crazy.

00:19:16,809 --> 00:19:18,544
Why? What do you got?

00:19:18,544 --> 00:19:21,513
Well, we already know that
the ace of spades was used

00:19:21,513 --> 00:19:23,782
to slash Coe's throat
in the elevator.

00:19:23,782 --> 00:19:27,519
There was a second contribution
on that same playing card,

00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:28,754
and it ain't human.

00:19:28,754 --> 00:19:29,755
Chicken blood?

00:19:29,755 --> 00:19:30,889
Mm-hmm.
So...

00:19:30,889 --> 00:19:32,891
whoever handled
the chicken hearts

00:19:32,891 --> 00:19:34,893
also handled the playing card.

00:19:34,893 --> 00:19:36,528
After the suspect
choked Aldridge

00:19:36,528 --> 00:19:39,131
with the chicken hearts,
the trace on his fingers

00:19:39,131 --> 00:19:42,668
was transferred to the ace
used to slash Coe's throat.

00:19:42,668 --> 00:19:45,070
Two victims, same killer.

00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,472
(grunting)

00:19:47,539 --> 00:19:49,007
According to his brother,

00:19:49,007 --> 00:19:51,944
Aldridge has a regular
high-stakes poker game

00:19:51,944 --> 00:19:55,214
every Friday downtown.
Okay...

00:19:55,214 --> 00:19:59,618
both our victims--white males,
early 50s, poker players.

00:19:59,618 --> 00:20:01,153
And we have
a kill signature

00:20:01,153 --> 00:20:03,789
that's suggestive
of a playing card.

00:20:03,789 --> 00:20:04,923
You thinking serial?

00:20:04,923 --> 00:20:06,592
I think we better
check old cases,

00:20:06,592 --> 00:20:08,660
see if any
fit the profile.

00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,028
If this guy's playing
a full hand,

00:20:10,028 --> 00:20:11,764

Old track marks running

00:20:49,067 --> 00:20:51,804
These last marks break
the pattern, don't they?

00:20:51,804 --> 00:20:53,505
STOKES:
Yeah, and those two

00:20:53,505 --> 00:20:57,142
hit musculature, which is not
a place to shoot up.

00:20:57,142 --> 00:20:59,611
FINLAY: Yeah, a waste of
perfectly good heroin.

00:20:59,611 --> 00:21:02,748
So I pulled the evidence,
and I retested the heroin.

00:21:02,748 --> 00:21:05,884
It was laced with the
Trifolium species of clover.

00:21:05,884 --> 00:21:06,885
Meaning?

00:21:06,885 --> 00:21:08,020
He was poisoned.

You know, clovers
are also known as clubs.

00:21:22,467 --> 00:21:24,002
Yeah.
This could be

00:21:24,002 --> 00:21:26,872
a bit of a long shot, but...

00:21:26,872 --> 00:21:29,474

what the heck.

00:21:29,474 --> 00:21:30,209

four of clubs to Ed Ficelli.
Now, y-you've

00:21:54,032 --> 00:21:55,567
been in this town for a while.

00:21:55,567 --> 00:21:57,903
Do these cards
mean anything in poker?

00:21:57,903 --> 00:22:01,607
Yeah, it's lousy--offsuit,
no pairs, no straight potential.

00:22:01,607 --> 00:22:03,108
The killer's dealing a bad hand.

00:22:03,108 --> 00:22:04,643
Hey, looks like
we caught a break.

00:22:04,643 --> 00:22:05,944
The poker chip

gave the room service guy--

00:22:07,479 --> 00:22:08,981
prints came back
to Ava Rendell.

00:22:08,981 --> 00:22:10,883
Our last woman standing.

00:22:10,883 --> 00:22:12,084

he died, right?

Something's not right.

00:22:17,189 --> 00:22:18,590
A little too convenient.

00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:20,192
You think she's being set up?

00:22:20,192 --> 00:22:22,160

This killer is
so methodical.

00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,463
Speaking to us

00:22:24,463 --> 00:22:27,566
Never leaving any fingerprints.

00:22:27,566 --> 00:22:29,601
Brass just found Ava.

00:22:55,627 --> 00:22:58,530
She checked in at nine.

00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:00,899
She used to give
private poker lessons.

00:23:00,899 --> 00:23:02,434
Any surveillance?

00:23:02,434 --> 00:23:04,903
Not yet.

00:23:04,903 --> 00:23:06,772
You okay?

00:23:06,772 --> 00:23:09,608
Hmm?

00:23:09,608 --> 00:23:11,710
Until we get this
killer to fold...

00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:12,811
No.

00:23:22,587 --> 00:23:27,059
Who is this discerped lass?

00:23:27,059 --> 00:23:28,193
"Discerped lass"?

00:23:28,193 --> 00:23:29,661
Well, you know...

00:23:29,661 --> 00:23:31,863
people usually
look at a picture like that,

00:23:31,863 --> 00:23:33,899
they...they show something.

00:23:33,899 --> 00:23:36,034
I'm not most people, am I?

00:23:36,034 --> 00:23:37,803
No.

00:23:37,803 --> 00:23:39,538
What can you tell us
about her?

00:23:43,108 --> 00:23:45,777
Well, she seems to be
missing a body, doesn't she?

00:23:45,777 --> 00:23:47,746
Because you removed it
from her head.

00:23:47,746 --> 00:23:49,214
Why would I do that?

00:23:49,214 --> 00:23:51,917
'Cause you like to shock
your audience.

00:23:51,917 --> 00:23:53,652
You're a magician.

00:23:53,652 --> 00:23:56,488
A magician...

00:23:56,488 --> 00:23:58,123
is an actor playing
the role of a magician.

00:23:59,925 --> 00:24:01,560
May I humbly suggest
whoever did that...

00:24:03,195 --> 00:24:06,031
...isn't playing.

00:24:06,031 --> 00:24:07,566
(knocking on glass)

00:24:07,566 --> 00:24:11,737
Ah, my counselor,
at last.

00:24:11,737 --> 00:24:14,706
You finished with your
flambuginous accusations,

00:24:14,706 --> 00:24:15,874
or am I to be released?

00:24:15,874 --> 00:24:17,976
Don't disappear, Copperfield.

00:24:24,049 --> 00:24:25,584
The wound's a
combination of

00:24:25,584 --> 00:24:29,054
sharp-force injury
and blunt-force trauma.

00:24:29,054 --> 00:24:31,423
The absence of multiple
tool marks

00:24:31,423 --> 00:24:33,525
suggests one chop.

00:24:33,525 --> 00:24:35,694
So it was an
unusual weapon.

00:24:46,138 --> 00:24:48,073
I never thought about
it before, but both

00:24:48,073 --> 00:24:50,909
the jack and the king
are holding weapons.

00:24:50,909 --> 00:24:52,944
King of hearts. Suicide king.

00:24:52,944 --> 00:24:56,214
Yeah, it looks like
he's stabbing himself
with his own sword.

00:24:56,214 --> 00:24:57,916
What if the killer
used a weapon

00:24:57,916 --> 00:24:59,584
from a playing card?

00:25:03,989 --> 00:25:07,692
Yeah, the king and the jack
are ready to fight.

00:25:07,692 --> 00:25:09,161
He's got an axe.

00:25:09,161 --> 00:25:11,496
King of diamonds
could be our man.

00:25:11,496 --> 00:25:14,066
ROBBINS: I found rust-like
trace in the wound.

00:25:14,066 --> 00:25:16,001
Edges are sharp and exhibit
a rim of abrasion,

00:25:16,001 --> 00:25:17,836
probably from

00:25:17,836 --> 00:25:20,138
the blunt nature
of the blade used.

00:25:20,138 --> 00:25:22,474
Well, you know something,
I-I don't know, sweetheart.

00:25:22,474 --> 00:25:24,009
Um...

00:25:24,009 --> 00:25:27,479
I-I'd just do
what you think is best.

00:25:27,479 --> 00:25:28,947
Okay. All right.

00:25:28,947 --> 00:25:29,948
I love you, too.

00:25:29,948 --> 00:25:30,949
Hey.

00:25:30,949 --> 00:25:32,484
Bye-bye.

00:25:32,484 --> 00:25:35,921
Wh-What do you know
about cooking beets?

00:25:35,921 --> 00:25:36,955
Don't do it?

00:25:36,955 --> 00:25:38,123
Yeah.

00:25:39,925 --> 00:25:41,093
Oh, how old's Charlie, there?

00:25:41,093 --> 00:25:42,694
Six years old.

00:25:42,694 --> 00:25:43,695
Peewee basketball.

00:25:45,764 --> 00:25:47,833
What's going on, man?

00:25:47,833 --> 00:25:49,734
You heard about
the sheriff job, right?

00:25:49,734 --> 00:25:51,470
I did.

00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:55,841
Well, who knew Morgan
would be a CSI here in Vegas?

00:25:55,841 --> 00:25:58,577
You worried about her,
or about the job?

00:25:59,978 --> 00:26:01,813
I don't know.

00:26:01,813 --> 00:26:02,881
Both.

00:26:02,881 --> 00:26:04,015
I'm not like you,

00:26:04,015 --> 00:26:05,450
I haven't had the best luck

00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:06,751
keeping the balancing act going.

00:26:06,751 --> 00:26:08,854
Yeah. Right.

00:26:08,854 --> 00:26:09,988
Why do you think my wife's

00:26:09,988 --> 00:26:11,056
calling me about beets?

00:26:11,056 --> 00:26:12,791
She wants to hear your voice.

00:26:12,791 --> 00:26:15,427
And I presume
you want to hear hers.

00:26:15,427 --> 00:26:16,695
Proves my point.

00:26:16,695 --> 00:26:17,996
True.

00:26:19,931 --> 00:26:22,667
You're worried that
if you take this job,

00:26:22,667 --> 00:26:24,569
things could change,

00:26:24,569 --> 00:26:27,205
just as things have
changed for the better, right?

00:26:27,205 --> 00:26:28,807
Valid concern, don't you think?

00:26:28,807 --> 00:26:30,075
I-I've told you

00:26:30,075 --> 00:26:33,645
the story about
my itinerant youth.

00:26:33,645 --> 00:26:35,013
Your parents
and the Volkswagen bus.

00:26:35,013 --> 00:26:36,815
Dodge van. Sorry.

00:26:36,815 --> 00:26:40,051
(chuckles)

00:26:40,051 --> 00:26:41,887
That wasn't the life
I would've chosen,

00:26:41,887 --> 00:26:43,722
but, you know,
it's part of who I am,

00:26:43,722 --> 00:26:46,057
so I-I like change.

00:26:46,057 --> 00:26:48,426
But Barbara can't stand it.

00:26:48,426 --> 00:26:50,061
So, what, coming to Vegas...

00:26:50,061 --> 00:26:52,197
Did not thrill her.

00:26:52,197 --> 00:26:53,798
But she knew how much
I wanted it,

00:26:53,798 --> 00:26:55,667
so...

00:26:55,667 --> 00:26:57,936
We-we work on it, man.

00:26:57,936 --> 00:27:01,640
It's a process.

00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:05,110
You offered me this job, Conrad,
and I...and I took it.

00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:08,947
I think you should do yourself
the same favor.

00:27:08,947 --> 00:27:10,715
You and Morgan'll
figure the rest out.

00:27:11,816 --> 00:27:13,151
Yeah?

00:27:13,151 --> 00:27:14,920
I found Ava Rendell's
murder weapon.

00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,088
The rusty metal trace
in Ava Rendell's neck wound

00:27:17,088 --> 00:27:18,623
has a combination of calcium,

00:27:18,623 --> 00:27:20,792
silicon dioxide
and ferric oxide.

00:27:20,792 --> 00:27:23,628
All consistent with antique iron

00:27:23,628 --> 00:27:24,963
made around the 16th century.

00:27:24,963 --> 00:27:26,531
RUSSELL:
Suggesting a medieval

00:27:26,531 --> 00:27:27,799
poleax is our weapon.

00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:29,834
Technically, it's a war hammer.

00:27:29,834 --> 00:27:32,571
Or, as the Germans call it,
a <i>fussstreithammer.</i>

00:27:32,571 --> 00:27:34,739
What-What-Whatever
it's called,

00:27:34,739 --> 00:27:36,074
it would take
something like that

00:27:36,074 --> 00:27:38,810
to be able to decapitate
our Miss Rendell, right?

00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:41,913
Definitely has a stronger blade
than a playing card.

00:27:41,913 --> 00:27:43,048
All right,
all right, look--

00:27:43,048 --> 00:27:44,482
the-the ace of spades.

00:27:44,482 --> 00:27:46,885
All-all our crime
scenes are spotless,

00:27:46,885 --> 00:27:49,054
but the killer left behind
the ace of spades.

00:27:49,054 --> 00:27:50,655
Why?

00:27:50,655 --> 00:27:53,024
I mean, that-that's
got to be deliberate.

00:27:53,024 --> 00:27:55,427
What did you find out
about our card?

00:27:55,427 --> 00:27:56,661
I ran the blood.

00:27:56,661 --> 00:27:58,430
Confirmed that it did
kill Peter Coe.

00:27:58,430 --> 00:27:59,664
But what about the plastic?

00:27:59,664 --> 00:28:00,932
What about--
what about the ink?

00:28:00,932 --> 00:28:02,567
You know, maybe the card itself

00:28:02,567 --> 00:28:04,669
is part of a message
the killer is sending us.

00:28:04,669 --> 00:28:06,605
It's just a typical
Bicycle card.

00:28:06,605 --> 00:28:09,074
Well, you...
That I will happily jump on.

00:28:09,074 --> 00:28:10,976
That'd be nice.
Okay.

00:28:10,976 --> 00:28:12,911
♪ ♪

00:28:33,665 --> 00:28:34,799
(beep, whirr)

00:28:43,208 --> 00:28:45,744
Hey, that ace
tell us anything new?

00:28:45,744 --> 00:28:46,978
Something old.

00:28:46,978 --> 00:28:48,580
It's a high-end,
expensive card

00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:50,615
made from two layers
of natural linen.

00:28:50,615 --> 00:28:51,616
Why is that old?

00:28:51,616 --> 00:28:52,884
This particular linen

00:28:52,884 --> 00:28:55,020
stopped being
manufactured in 1998.

00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,221
I also found

00:28:56,221 --> 00:28:58,089
a hidden watermark

00:28:58,089 --> 00:28:59,624
in the latex
polymer that glues

00:28:59,624 --> 00:29:02,093
together the two layers of card.

00:29:02,093 --> 00:29:03,995
That's the Palermo logo.

00:29:03,995 --> 00:29:06,631
So this was from
a special edition deck?

00:29:06,631 --> 00:29:09,934
Manufactured for the 1997
Palermo Poker Classic.

00:29:09,934 --> 00:29:12,470
Peter Coe won that tournament.

00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:15,106
SANDERS:
The 1997 classic. Third round.

00:29:15,106 --> 00:29:17,575
You may recognize
some of our players.

00:29:17,575 --> 00:29:19,144
Peter Coe,

00:29:19,144 --> 00:29:20,612
our elevator victim.

00:29:20,612 --> 00:29:21,746
RUSSELL:
Trent Aldridge.

00:29:21,746 --> 00:29:22,981
Our S&amp;M vic.

00:29:22,981 --> 00:29:24,582
Eating a chicken wing.

00:29:24,582 --> 00:29:25,917
That is so wrong.

00:29:25,917 --> 00:29:28,586
Rounding out the table
is the Snake.

00:29:28,586 --> 00:29:29,688
Bo Mattison.

00:29:29,688 --> 00:29:30,889
"Hold 'Em" legend,

00:29:30,889 --> 00:29:32,624
and the master
of the "slow play."

00:29:32,624 --> 00:29:35,060
He would sit on a great hand,
and then wait,

00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,828
like a snake in the grass,
before striking

00:29:36,828 --> 00:29:37,996
without warning.

00:29:37,996 --> 00:29:39,597
How does the Snake
play into our case?

00:29:39,597 --> 00:29:42,667
Well, he is about to get
the death hand.

00:29:44,169 --> 00:29:45,670
And there they are:

00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:48,640
The ace of spades,
the seven of hearts,

00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,908
four of clubs.

00:29:49,908 --> 00:29:51,209
I'll be damned.
FINLAY:
Oh, wow.

00:29:51,209 --> 00:29:52,811
King of diamonds
should be next, right?

00:29:55,647 --> 00:29:57,849
That is so creepy.

00:29:57,849 --> 00:29:59,150
SANDERS:
Now, Aldridge folded,

00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:00,852
and here comes the river card.

00:30:00,852 --> 00:30:02,654
RUSSELL:
King of spades.

00:30:02,654 --> 00:30:04,089
We haven't seen that yet.

00:30:04,089 --> 00:30:06,124
SANDERS: Now, the Snake has
an ace-king full boat--

00:30:06,124 --> 00:30:09,761
very strong--
but Coe has two kings.

00:30:09,761 --> 00:30:12,597
And he wins,
with four of a kind.

00:30:12,597 --> 00:30:14,132
RUSSELL:
Where is this Bo Mattison now?

00:30:14,132 --> 00:30:17,702
He is playing the great
"Hold 'Em" game in the sky.

00:30:17,702 --> 00:30:19,437
He was a meth addict.

00:30:19,437 --> 00:30:21,840
Countless arrests, broke,
and a week after this,

00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,074
he killed himself

00:30:23,074 --> 00:30:24,943
under a jungle gym
in Tresser Park.

00:30:24,943 --> 00:30:26,711
What else do we know
about this Bo?

00:30:26,711 --> 00:30:28,747
SANDERS:
Jersey guy. Divorced.

00:30:28,747 --> 00:30:30,048
Total loner.

00:30:30,048 --> 00:30:31,616
So there's an ex-wife
in the picture.

00:30:31,616 --> 00:30:32,617
Is she alive?

00:30:32,617 --> 00:30:33,918
I can find out.

00:30:33,918 --> 00:30:35,887
If Dr. Jimmy is
our prime suspect,

00:30:35,887 --> 00:30:39,524
there has to be some connection
between him and Bo.

00:30:39,524 --> 00:30:40,859
So, we need to do
some more digging.

00:30:40,859 --> 00:30:42,660
I mean,
Bo may be dead,

00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:45,029
but someone out there
is killing people.

00:30:45,029 --> 00:30:47,799
BRODY:
Found Bo Mattison's wife...

00:30:47,799 --> 00:30:51,035
in the Holy Cross cemetery
in Newark, New Jersey.

00:30:51,035 --> 00:30:52,704
Takes her
off the suspect list.

00:30:52,704 --> 00:30:55,473
She died, in 1990, of cancer.

00:30:55,473 --> 00:30:57,776
Any time Bo finished
a tournament,

00:30:57,776 --> 00:30:59,477
he would kiss the St. Catherine
medal

00:30:59,477 --> 00:31:01,212
he wore around his neck.

00:31:01,212 --> 00:31:03,581
St. Catherine is the
patron saint of cancer.

00:31:03,581 --> 00:31:05,950
(phone chiming)
Thinking of his wife--
hold on a sec.

00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:09,621
Nick just ran
Dr. Jimmy's credit cards.

00:31:09,621 --> 00:31:12,090
Four months ago, Dr. Jimmy
ordered a poleax

00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:13,958
from a historical society;
had it sent

00:31:13,958 --> 00:31:15,460
<i>to his theater.</i>

00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,628
James Nefarro.

00:31:16,628 --> 00:31:17,996
LVPD.

00:31:37,449 --> 00:31:38,983
(woman gasps)

00:31:38,983 --> 00:31:39,918
What the hell?

00:31:42,187 --> 00:31:45,623
Geez, you scared
the crap out of me.

00:31:45,623 --> 00:31:46,624
You're not the only one.

00:31:46,624 --> 00:31:48,993
Where's Dr. Jimmy?

00:31:48,993 --> 00:31:50,595
I thought you were him.

00:31:50,595 --> 00:31:51,596
He was here?

00:31:51,596 --> 00:31:53,731
Five minutes ago.

00:31:53,731 --> 00:31:55,166
He told me to lay here

00:31:55,166 --> 00:31:56,568
and be still.

00:31:56,568 --> 00:31:59,070
And when he says it,
he means it.

00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:02,106
He must've
seen us coming.

00:32:02,106 --> 00:32:03,708
Is Jimmy in trouble?

00:32:03,708 --> 00:32:04,742
Does Dr. Jimmy

00:32:04,742 --> 00:32:06,044
use an axe in his show?

00:32:06,044 --> 00:32:07,111
Yeah.

00:32:07,111 --> 00:32:08,813
Um, axe...

00:32:08,813 --> 00:32:10,949
sword, scissors.

00:32:10,949 --> 00:32:12,684
He uses them to slice cards.

00:32:12,684 --> 00:32:14,085
Is the axe here?

00:32:14,085 --> 00:32:16,154
Mm-hmm.

00:32:16,154 --> 00:32:19,123
It's over there.

00:32:31,135 --> 00:32:35,607
Well, I think
we found Jimmy's axe.

00:32:35,607 --> 00:32:37,742
And it looks like
there's blood on the blade.

00:32:37,742 --> 00:32:40,044
And Jimmy's pulled
a vanishing act.

00:32:46,618 --> 00:32:48,186
Oh, nice follow-through.

00:32:50,755 --> 00:32:52,891
Alas, poor Jell-O man.

00:32:52,891 --> 00:32:54,692
I knew him well.

00:32:57,896 --> 00:32:59,631
Well, the tool marks

00:32:59,631 --> 00:33:01,165
match Ava Rendell's
neck wounds.

00:33:01,165 --> 00:33:03,201
Looks like
Dr. Jimmy's our killer.

00:33:03,201 --> 00:33:04,502
Yeah.

00:33:04,502 --> 00:33:06,604
Still doesn't explain why.

00:33:06,604 --> 00:33:07,972
SANDERS:
<i>I think I know why.</i>

00:33:07,972 --> 00:33:09,574
I have been watching

00:33:09,574 --> 00:33:11,743
Bo Mattison's final
hand over and over.

00:33:11,743 --> 00:33:13,945
I assume he
keeps losing?
He does.

00:33:13,945 --> 00:33:15,713
To four kings.

00:33:15,713 --> 00:33:18,216
Now, four of a kind is the
third rarest hand in poker.

00:33:18,216 --> 00:33:21,986
Yet, Peter Coe builds to it with
the turn and the river card.

00:33:21,986 --> 00:33:23,688
What are the odds?

00:33:23,688 --> 00:33:26,124
Yeah, but it's poker, right?
I mean, he got lucky.

00:33:26,124 --> 00:33:28,459
I don't think luck has
anything to do with it.

00:33:28,459 --> 00:33:29,928
You think Peter Coe cheated?

00:33:29,928 --> 00:33:31,896
I think they <i>all</i> cheated.

00:33:31,896 --> 00:33:32,964
Watch this.

00:33:32,964 --> 00:33:34,599
Now, the hardest cheating

00:33:34,599 --> 00:33:36,534
for a casino to detect
isn't card counting

00:33:36,534 --> 00:33:37,635
or marking the deck.

00:33:37,635 --> 00:33:39,003
It's collusion
among players.

00:33:39,003 --> 00:33:41,472
Or as grifters call it,
"playing cousins."

00:33:41,472 --> 00:33:44,943
Now, watch as Coe and Aldridge
communicate with each other.

00:33:44,943 --> 00:33:46,544
Now, Aldridge places a chip

00:33:46,544 --> 00:33:48,913
on his hole cards, and then,
taps it with his finger.

00:33:48,913 --> 00:33:51,082
He's telling Coe that
he has a lousy hand.

00:33:51,082 --> 00:33:53,818
No pairs, off suited.
And Coe?

00:33:53,818 --> 00:33:56,020
Coe is going to hold his
glass with his right hand,

00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:58,656
using his thumb
and two fingers.

00:33:58,656 --> 00:34:00,191
He's telling Aldridge
he has two kings.

00:34:00,191 --> 00:34:01,759
And Aldridge

00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:02,961
locks his hands together.

00:34:02,961 --> 00:34:04,862
That's the
crossfire signal.

00:34:04,862 --> 00:34:08,099
They're going to trap Bo
with raises and re-raises.

00:34:08,099 --> 00:34:09,734
Building up the pot.

00:34:09,734 --> 00:34:12,637
Now, all game, Aldridge bets
high and never stays in.

00:34:12,637 --> 00:34:14,706
He's feeding Coe
all of his chips.

00:34:14,706 --> 00:34:16,674
The dealer's name is
Glenn Heidbredder.

00:34:16,674 --> 00:34:17,809
Watch as he deals
the turn card.

00:34:19,577 --> 00:34:21,112
He's dealing seconds.

00:34:21,112 --> 00:34:23,114
He deals that, instead
of the deck card.

00:34:23,114 --> 00:34:24,582
You're kidding me.

00:34:24,582 --> 00:34:25,850
Watch it in slow-motion.

00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:27,218
Heidbredder died a year later.

00:34:27,218 --> 00:34:29,520
One survivor,
until yesterday.

00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,755
A daughter.

00:34:30,755 --> 00:34:33,791
Birth name--
Ava Heidbredder.

00:34:33,791 --> 00:34:35,960
Ava Rendell.

00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,896
Daughter of a lifer dealer,
just like she said.

00:34:38,896 --> 00:34:41,599
Okay, so we have...we have
two players and a dealer

00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:43,501
involved in a cheating scam.
What-what about

00:34:43,501 --> 00:34:44,802
this Ed Ficelli, the...

00:34:44,802 --> 00:34:46,437
the four of clubs?

00:34:46,437 --> 00:34:48,573
Well, according to the
Gaming Commission's

00:34:48,573 --> 00:34:49,974
black book of 1997...

00:34:49,974 --> 00:34:52,677
What do you do?
You keep that on your bed stand?

00:34:52,677 --> 00:34:53,911
My iPad.

00:34:53,911 --> 00:34:55,580
But according to the book,

00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:57,649
Ficelli was banned
from the casinos in '02

00:34:57,649 --> 00:35:00,485
for running a collusion
scam at Hold 'Em tables.

00:35:00,485 --> 00:35:03,221
So he was the idea man,
the-the organizer.

00:35:03,221 --> 00:35:06,124
Yeah, but they all
cheated Bo Mattison.

00:35:06,124 --> 00:35:07,859
They drove him to suicide.

00:35:07,859 --> 00:35:11,062
So, if Dr. Jimmy is
avenging Bo Mattison,

00:35:11,062 --> 00:35:13,531
still doesn't answer
the question why.

00:35:13,531 --> 00:35:15,533
I mean, what's his skin
in the game?

00:35:15,533 --> 00:35:19,570
Pete Coe, player one in '97,
gets the ace of spades.

00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:21,572
Trent Aldridge,
player two in '97--

00:35:21,572 --> 00:35:22,740
seven of hearts.

00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,108
Ed Ficelli,

00:35:24,108 --> 00:35:25,743
'97 ringleader,

00:35:25,743 --> 00:35:27,679
gets four of clubs.

00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:31,749
Ava Rendell, daughter of the
'97 dealer--king of diamonds.

00:35:31,749 --> 00:35:35,887
My question to you is--
who gets the king of spades?

00:35:35,887 --> 00:35:37,755
Who's our next victim?
SANDERS:
Nobody.

00:35:37,755 --> 00:35:39,624
Everyone from Bo's table's dead.

00:35:39,624 --> 00:35:41,959
And Dr. Jimmy
already finished his hand.

00:35:41,959 --> 00:35:44,095
Yeah, and his last trick
was a disappearing act.

00:35:44,095 --> 00:35:46,497
That doesn't make sense
to me, though.

00:35:46,497 --> 00:35:49,467
I mean, why would Dr. Jimmy
leave us with one extra card,

00:35:49,467 --> 00:35:50,802
and then vanish?

00:35:50,802 --> 00:35:53,638
Then how do you account
for the king of spades?

00:35:53,638 --> 00:35:55,073
Maybe it's Jimmy.

00:35:55,073 --> 00:35:56,874
We've been assuming
that he's our killer.

00:35:56,874 --> 00:35:58,609
What if he's
the final victim?

00:35:58,609 --> 00:36:01,112
Well, Jimmy has been known
to stake players.

00:36:01,112 --> 00:36:03,181
Peter Coe, our
elevator vic, for one.

00:36:03,181 --> 00:36:04,816
You think Dr. Jimmy

00:36:04,816 --> 00:36:06,617
was Bo Mattison's
money man back in '97?

00:36:06,617 --> 00:36:08,486
Well, we know
that Bo was broke.

00:36:08,486 --> 00:36:11,022
Maybe Dr. Jimmy supplies
the patsy with the buy-in money.

00:36:11,022 --> 00:36:13,758
If that were the case,
that would make Dr. Jimmy

00:36:13,758 --> 00:36:15,827
a coconspirator
in the cheating scam.

00:36:16,928 --> 00:36:18,796
And the next to die.

00:36:18,796 --> 00:36:20,798
Hey, I got a partial profile

00:36:20,798 --> 00:36:23,634
off the epithelials
on the poleax.

00:36:23,634 --> 00:36:27,538
STRs show
a female familial match

00:36:27,538 --> 00:36:29,207
with Bo Mattison.

00:36:29,207 --> 00:36:31,642
Could be a daughter, a sister...

00:36:31,642 --> 00:36:33,811
Looked into Bo Mattison.
He's an only child.

00:36:33,811 --> 00:36:37,115
So, then, a daughter?
Explains the rage.

00:36:37,115 --> 00:36:38,216
The overkill.

00:36:38,216 --> 00:36:40,885
It was someone
close to him.

00:36:40,885 --> 00:36:43,187
Or someone who <i>wanted</i>
to be close to him.

00:36:43,187 --> 00:36:45,623
It was right
in front of us. Um...

00:36:47,058 --> 00:36:49,160
St. Catherine's medal.

00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,662
We thought he...he was doing
that to honor his wife,

00:36:51,662 --> 00:36:54,031
but I think...I think
it was for someone else.

00:36:54,031 --> 00:36:57,034
Someone whose name
is Catherine.

00:36:57,034 --> 00:36:58,569
SANDERS: Katy Hill.

00:36:58,569 --> 00:36:59,570
Dr. Jimmy's assistant.

00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:01,706
She had access to the ax.

00:37:01,706 --> 00:37:03,107
Set Jimmy up.

00:37:03,107 --> 00:37:05,777
You know, magician
as misdirect.

00:37:05,777 --> 00:37:07,478
Look over here.

00:37:07,478 --> 00:37:09,580
While she's pulling off
one last trick.
Right.

00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:10,715
(phone chimes)

00:37:10,715 --> 00:37:11,916
Excuse me.

00:37:11,916 --> 00:37:13,117
Yeah. Hey, Jim.

00:37:14,852 --> 00:37:16,854
Where?

00:37:16,854 --> 00:37:18,823
Okay, thank you.

00:37:18,823 --> 00:37:20,792
LVPD just found Dr. Jimmy's car

00:37:20,792 --> 00:37:22,026
in Tresser Park.

00:37:22,026 --> 00:37:23,027
No sign of Jimmy.

00:37:23,027 --> 00:37:24,662
Tresser Park? That's...

00:37:24,662 --> 00:37:28,065
That's where
Bo Mattison killed himself.

00:37:28,065 --> 00:37:30,468
Katy is going
to kill Dr. Jimmy there.

00:37:36,707 --> 00:37:39,076
SANDERS:
Let's pop the trunk.

00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:47,084
Garden spade.

00:37:48,152 --> 00:37:49,954
No dirt on it.

00:37:49,954 --> 00:37:51,923
Probably hasn't
even been used.

00:37:51,923 --> 00:37:54,826
That means Dr. Jimmy
might still be alive.

00:37:54,826 --> 00:37:57,862
All right, guys, we need to
fan out and search the area.

00:37:57,862 --> 00:37:59,597
Let's do this.

00:38:32,897 --> 00:38:34,432
Show me your hands.

00:38:34,432 --> 00:38:35,600
Your hands!

00:38:37,468 --> 00:38:39,170
It's you.

00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:41,606
Good.
Where's Jimmy?

00:38:41,606 --> 00:38:43,074
You mean the river card?

00:38:45,543 --> 00:38:48,112
I know what
they did to your father.

00:38:48,112 --> 00:38:51,449
You figured out who I am.

00:38:51,449 --> 00:38:53,017
When my mom
died last year,

00:38:53,017 --> 00:38:54,919
I went through
her stuff,

00:38:54,919 --> 00:38:58,522
and I found this note
that Bo wrote me.

00:39:00,091 --> 00:39:02,660
He figured out
he'd been cheated.

00:39:04,161 --> 00:39:05,529
But it was too late.

00:39:07,765 --> 00:39:09,700
The truth is, those bastards

00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:13,137
cheated me as much
as they cheated him.

00:39:18,709 --> 00:39:19,710
It's hard.

00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:21,212
(crying)

00:39:21,212 --> 00:39:23,481
The pain of not having a father.

00:39:23,481 --> 00:39:24,649
The anger.

00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:29,186
I know.
You don't know
anything about me.

00:39:29,186 --> 00:39:31,022
I know that you're suffering.

00:39:31,022 --> 00:39:33,758
Part of you wants this to end.

00:39:33,758 --> 00:39:36,460
Dr. Jimmy is out there
somewhere, alive,

00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,762
and the best thing

00:39:37,762 --> 00:39:39,530
that you can do
for yourself is to let him go.

00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:42,466
You want me
to show you my cards?

00:39:44,435 --> 00:39:47,438
Jimmy is in Hell
with the rest of them!

00:39:48,806 --> 00:39:49,974
Very naughty.

00:39:57,949 --> 00:39:59,717
(yells)

00:39:59,717 --> 00:40:02,653
<i>I'll show you</i>
<i>where I buried him.</i>

00:40:02,653 --> 00:40:03,888
You're bluffing.

00:40:03,888 --> 00:40:05,189
What?

00:40:05,189 --> 00:40:08,693
You're slow-playing me,
just like your dad.

00:40:08,693 --> 00:40:10,428
You led us here.

00:40:10,428 --> 00:40:12,563
You're buying time.

00:40:12,563 --> 00:40:14,899
(auto-dial beeping,
phone line ringing)

00:40:14,899 --> 00:40:16,100
Nick, you still
at the theater?

00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,101
STOKES:
Yeah.

00:40:17,101 --> 00:40:18,703
Dr. Jimmy is there.

00:40:22,106 --> 00:40:23,140
Jimmy?

00:40:24,475 --> 00:40:26,577
(muffled groaning)

00:40:29,046 --> 00:40:30,715
Never...(panting)

00:40:30,715 --> 00:40:33,150
trust an assistant
with sharp objects.

00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:34,618
STOKES:
I got him. He's okay.

00:40:34,618 --> 00:40:36,620
No!

00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:38,522
(gunshot)

00:40:41,759 --> 00:40:43,694
SANDERS:
Morgan!

00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:54,038
Hey...

00:40:55,539 --> 00:40:57,575
Last woman standing.

00:40:59,143 --> 00:41:01,812
How does it feel?

00:41:01,812 --> 00:41:03,848
OFFICER:
Hey! They're over here!
SANDERS: Morgan!

00:41:08,219 --> 00:41:10,154
(gasping)

00:41:18,529 --> 00:41:19,563
You okay?

00:41:19,563 --> 00:41:21,966
Yeah.

00:41:31,642 --> 00:41:34,912
Hey.

00:41:34,912 --> 00:41:35,846
Hey.

00:41:38,649 --> 00:41:39,884
Heard you did
good tonight.

00:41:43,621 --> 00:41:45,523
Yeah, I was just
doing my job.

00:41:48,459 --> 00:41:49,960
You sure you're okay?

00:41:53,197 --> 00:41:56,500
I've-I've...I've had
to shoot...shoot at people.

00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,135
I've never...I've never
really had to...

00:42:04,909 --> 00:42:06,077
You and I have
been getting in

00:42:06,077 --> 00:42:09,013
a lot of close
scrapes lately, huh?

00:42:09,013 --> 00:42:10,981
It's better than sitting
behind a desk, I guess.

00:42:10,981 --> 00:42:12,817
(laughs)

00:42:12,817 --> 00:42:15,619
Oh, I...I didn't mean...

00:42:15,619 --> 00:42:16,987
Sorry. That's not
what I meant at all.

00:42:16,987 --> 00:42:19,557
No, no, I know... I know what
you mean.

00:42:19,557 --> 00:42:20,825
But then again,
it's not so bad

00:42:20,825 --> 00:42:24,862
when you get to
pick your own desk.

00:42:24,862 --> 00:42:26,530
You signed
the sheriff paperwork.

00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:27,765
I did.

00:42:27,765 --> 00:42:28,966
Wait--seriously?

00:42:28,966 --> 00:42:30,568
(laughs)

00:42:30,568 --> 00:42:32,436
Sheriff Ecklie.

00:42:32,436 --> 00:42:33,838
That's awesome.

00:42:33,838 --> 00:42:35,840
I don't know.
It feels right.
Yeah.

00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,974
It is.

00:42:41,445 --> 00:42:42,913
Got reservations at Mastro's.

00:42:42,913 --> 00:42:44,515
You want to celebrate?

00:42:46,717 --> 00:42:47,985
Yeah. I do.

00:42:47,985 --> 00:42:49,520
You sure?

00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,655
Uh, absolutely.
I'm all in. Let's do it.
