Saw them in '78 at
the Spectrum in Philly.

00:00:46,972 --> 00:00:49,140
Around the same time
I saw the Dead

00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,942
at the Winterland
Ballroom.

00:00:50,942 --> 00:00:52,644

Look, this reporter's just gonna

follow you around
for a few days.

00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:19,571
He gets his story.
We all go home.

00:01:20,905 --> 00:01:22,540

So, Ozzy, another
incredible gig.

00:02:01,546 --> 00:02:03,648
The new album is
entitled <i>13,</i> am I right?

00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:05,016
That's-that's correct.

00:02:05,016 --> 00:02:07,218
The album's kind of like a...
a modern sound,

00:02:07,218 --> 00:02:09,187
but there's no denying
it's a Black Sabbath album.

00:02:09,187 --> 00:02:11,523
Still got the Black Sabbath
vibe, you know?

00:02:11,523 --> 00:02:13,625
Listen, I think we got it.
Thank you so much.
Thank you. Nice one.

00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:14,659
I'm sure
you don't remember this,

00:02:14,659 --> 00:02:15,660
but you were actually

00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,563
my first interview ever.
I was?

00:02:18,563 --> 00:02:19,864
The Ultimate Sin Tour, 1986.

00:02:19,864 --> 00:02:22,167
Really?
I-I don't remember.

00:02:22,167 --> 00:02:23,702
The concert or me?

00:02:23,702 --> 00:02:25,003
I don't remember 1986.
(chuckles)

00:02:25,003 --> 00:02:26,738
Really great to meet you.

00:02:26,738 --> 00:02:28,206
Thanks for you time again.
You're very welcome.

00:02:28,206 --> 00:02:29,974
Best of luck with of the tour.
All right, thank you.

00:02:29,974 --> 00:02:32,110
Sheriff Ecklie,
good to see you.

00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,478
John Merchiston,
<i>Savoir</i> magazine.

00:02:33,478 --> 00:02:35,046
D.B. Russell, CSI.

00:02:35,046 --> 00:02:36,715
It's a pleasure
to finally meet you.

00:02:36,715 --> 00:02:38,783
I was reading up about
your exploits in Seattle

00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:41,052
catching the Gig Harbor Killer.
Real thriller.

00:02:41,052 --> 00:02:42,721
I'm not sure
that three days

00:02:42,721 --> 00:02:45,590
with us will, uh, reach
that same level of thrills.

00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:48,893
I sense a certain reluctance
on your part.

00:02:48,893 --> 00:02:50,862
I just don't see the value,
to be honest, you know.

00:02:50,862 --> 00:02:53,131
Another story about cops.
Hardly cops,
are you?

00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:55,667
I mean, you're the, uh,
nation's number one crime lab.

00:02:55,667 --> 00:02:58,169
Sworn to uphold the law
in the land of the lawless.

00:02:58,169 --> 00:02:59,938
I-I've got a working
title, actually.
(cell phone ringing)

00:02:59,938 --> 00:03:03,108
It's, uh, "Police as Paradox
in Sin City."

00:03:03,108 --> 00:03:05,009
There's your positive
PR for you.
Yes.

00:03:05,009 --> 00:03:06,711
Um, I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to go.

00:03:06,711 --> 00:03:07,746
I got a 419.

00:03:07,746 --> 00:03:09,147
Dead body.

00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:11,116
Sounds like we're off
to a good start.

00:03:11,116 --> 00:03:13,852
Okay, all right.
Go get your stuff.

00:03:13,852 --> 00:03:16,221
You just signed yourself up
for the grave shift.

00:03:17,956 --> 00:03:19,991
RUSSELL:
<i>What the hell is this place?</i>

00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:21,426
These are porn stages.

00:03:21,426 --> 00:03:22,961
Used by a local
production company.

00:03:22,961 --> 00:03:24,829
They're currently
out of town.

00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:26,431
I assume you've met...

00:03:26,431 --> 00:03:28,466
Yes. Mr. Merchiston
and I went over

00:03:28,466 --> 00:03:29,934
the ground rules, right?

00:03:29,934 --> 00:03:31,636
I brought my own latex.

00:03:31,636 --> 00:03:32,937
Yeah, now you don't
touch anything. Clear?

00:03:32,937 --> 00:03:34,739
You know, I did a piece
on Scotland Yard,

00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:36,708
so I had to pass
their forensic field training.

00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:37,909
Impressive,
Sherlock.

00:03:37,909 --> 00:03:40,145
Keep your hands
in your pocket.

00:03:40,145 --> 00:03:42,914
Welcome to the Love Motel.

00:03:44,983 --> 00:03:46,785
New partner, Jim?

00:03:46,785 --> 00:03:49,988
Oh, uh, John Merchiston, this
is, uh, CSI Julie Finlay.

00:03:49,988 --> 00:03:51,723
RUSSELL:
Mr. Merchiston's
a reporter,

00:03:51,723 --> 00:03:52,924
and he's embedded
with us

00:03:52,924 --> 00:03:53,925
for a few days.

00:03:53,925 --> 00:03:54,926
All right, fill me in.

00:03:54,926 --> 00:03:56,895
Jane Doe.
Mummified body.

00:03:56,895 --> 00:03:59,631
So, she's been here at
least a couple of months.

00:03:59,631 --> 00:04:01,533
You'd think so,
but according to the owner

00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:03,468
of this fine establishment,
not so.

00:04:03,468 --> 00:04:04,869
What do you mean?

00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:07,205
Production on
<i>Lambskin Linings Playbook</i>

00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,439
ended Monday.

00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:09,741
The company, uh,
picked up,

00:04:09,741 --> 00:04:11,543
went to an adult
convention in Miami.

00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:13,444
The place has been
locked up for 48 hours.

00:04:13,444 --> 00:04:15,513
At least until it was
broken into this morning.

00:04:15,513 --> 00:04:17,448
FINLAY:
Skin under the neck
is opened up.

00:04:17,448 --> 00:04:18,817
You can see the hyoid bone.

00:04:18,817 --> 00:04:21,820
It's broken.
So she was strangled.

00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,555
What is that? (sniffs)

00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:26,024
That sweet, flowery
smell-- what is that?

00:04:26,024 --> 00:04:28,459
Well, obviously, you guys
don't hang out in strip clubs.

00:04:28,459 --> 00:04:32,430
Yeah, I-I thing it's called
"Honeysuckle," um...

00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,665
"Honeysuckle" something.
What's it called?

00:04:33,665 --> 00:04:35,099
Honeysuckle...
"Summer."

00:04:35,099 --> 00:04:36,100
"Honeysuckle Summer."

00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,168
That's it.

00:04:37,168 --> 00:04:38,169
Personal experience?

00:04:38,169 --> 00:04:40,071
I never reveal a source.

00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:41,840
It's odd, though,
isn't it, that there's

00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,175
this new stripper smell
on an old stripper body?

00:04:44,175 --> 00:04:45,677
That's not all
that's new.

00:04:45,677 --> 00:04:48,046
Lingerie still has
the price tag on it.

00:04:48,046 --> 00:04:50,915
Okay, all right,
so maybe she was a stripper,

00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:52,584
maybe she wasn't.

00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:56,688
Either way, killer strangles
her, mummifies the body,

00:04:56,688 --> 00:04:59,958
breaks in, stages her
to look like a porn star.

00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:02,193

to the Bible
on the nightstand.

00:05:49,908 --> 00:05:52,443
Could be our killer's obsessed

Bunch of zeroes carved on it.

00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,029
It opens.

00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:14,966
(gasps)

00:06:14,966 --> 00:06:17,035
That is a black widow.

That's the "false black widow."

00:06:20,438 --> 00:06:22,874
Harmless.
Says you.

00:06:22,874 --> 00:06:25,209
Beware of killers bearing gifts.

00:06:28,613 --> 00:06:30,515
If we can restore
her prints

00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:34,052
or extract DNA,
maybe we can get an I.D.

00:06:34,052 --> 00:06:36,587
Of course, there's no guarantee
she'll be in the system.

00:06:36,587 --> 00:06:39,590
Could be we'd have more luck
if we restore her face.

00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:42,226
Oh, it's a little late
for that, Doc.

00:06:42,226 --> 00:06:43,695
Not necessarily.

00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:45,663
You're thinking Dr. Stevens.

00:06:45,663 --> 00:06:47,565
Who's Dr. Stevens?

00:06:47,565 --> 00:06:50,768
He's developed rehydrating
techniques to identify bodies

00:06:50,768 --> 00:06:52,704
found in desert environments.

00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:53,871
The process,

00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:56,140
it not only
restores the skin,

00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:58,977
but it restores the vital
organs, everything.

00:06:58,977 --> 00:07:01,145
We can do
a full autopsy.

00:07:01,145 --> 00:07:02,580
There's just
one problem.

00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,148
And what's that?

00:07:04,148 --> 00:07:05,950
There's always a risk
the process could destroy

00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,719
additional evidence.

00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:09,754
Well, right now,
getting an I.D.

00:07:09,754 --> 00:07:11,522
is our best shot
at catching this killer.

00:07:11,522 --> 00:07:14,726

I don't know, man.

00:08:38,943 --> 00:08:40,878

00:08:40,878 --> 00:08:42,580
They could be symbols,
couldn't they?

00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,849
I just got back from Luxor.

00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:47,518
The one in Egypt.

00:08:47,518 --> 00:08:49,787
I was doing an article
on the tourist trade there,

00:08:49,787 --> 00:08:51,022
or the lack thereof.

00:08:51,022 --> 00:08:52,757
I don't know.
Hieroglyphics are just

00:08:52,757 --> 00:08:53,925
in my mind right now.

00:08:53,925 --> 00:08:55,693
Hieroglyphics, symbols,
you know.

00:08:55,693 --> 00:08:56,761
Right.

00:08:56,761 --> 00:08:59,130
Do you mind
if I touch this one?

00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:00,832
(chuckling): No, go ahead.
Thanks.

00:09:02,133 --> 00:09:03,801
The spider's definitely
a dramatic touch,

00:09:03,801 --> 00:09:06,137
wouldn't you say?

00:09:06,137 --> 00:09:08,806
That's the pill bug
you're smelling.

00:09:08,806 --> 00:09:11,876
It emits a chemical
to deter predators.

00:09:11,876 --> 00:09:16,013
It's impressive, your, uh...
your knowledge of entomology.

00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:18,149
I had a good teacher.

00:09:20,618 --> 00:09:23,488
Going public with
the photo of our victim

00:09:23,488 --> 00:09:25,223
really paid off.
You remember "Miss Kitty"?

00:09:25,223 --> 00:09:26,891
RUSSELL:
She recognize the victim?

00:09:26,891 --> 00:09:29,527
She only wants
to talk to you, so...

00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:30,862
Hey.

00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:32,964
Miss Kitty,
nice to see you again.

00:09:32,964 --> 00:09:34,499
You, too.

00:09:34,499 --> 00:09:36,067
Oh, and it's not
"Miss Kitty" anymore.

00:09:36,067 --> 00:09:39,036
I don't use my street name.
I use my real name now.

00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:40,505
Angela Banner.

00:09:40,505 --> 00:09:41,839
Said you're out
of the game now, right?

00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,107
Yes, and that's why
I know Megan.

00:09:43,107 --> 00:09:44,675
She's the girl that was killed?

00:09:44,675 --> 00:09:45,810
Megan Ramirez.
She was a stripper.

00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,178
Did porn on the side.

00:09:47,178 --> 00:09:50,047
Like me, she wanted out.
And I was helping her

00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:52,183
through the Fellowship
of Fallen Angels.

00:09:52,183 --> 00:09:53,818
Oh, the stripper church
downtown?

00:09:53,818 --> 00:09:55,553
Brother Larson's ministry.

00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:56,954
Brother Larson.

00:09:56,954 --> 00:09:58,723
We're working to save girls
like Megan.

00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,658
Now, when was the last time
you saw her?

00:10:00,658 --> 00:10:02,026
Two months ago

00:10:02,026 --> 00:10:03,995
at a support meeting.
And then she just...

00:10:03,995 --> 00:10:05,496
disappeared.

00:10:05,496 --> 00:10:06,898
But that's not all.

00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:09,767
Since then, all of these
girls have disappeared.

00:10:09,767 --> 00:10:12,537
They haven't come to
counseling, to meetings,

00:10:12,537 --> 00:10:15,173
to fellowship suppers.
And you know they got to eat.

00:10:15,173 --> 00:10:16,574
In spite of your

00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:18,509
valiant efforts
to save these girls,

00:10:18,509 --> 00:10:20,778
some of them may not want
to be saved.

00:10:20,778 --> 00:10:22,213
If they had any doubt,
they would've come to me

00:10:22,213 --> 00:10:23,681
or Brother Larson.

00:10:23,681 --> 00:10:24,782
They wouldn't
just up and leave.

00:10:24,782 --> 00:10:26,184
Y'all have to do
something

00:10:26,184 --> 00:10:27,985
so that these girls
don't end up like Megan.

00:10:27,985 --> 00:10:28,986
Excuse me.

00:10:32,723 --> 00:10:34,592
Look, Nancy, that's all
I know right now.

00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:37,495
No, I mean, it's... I don't have
any more information.

00:10:37,495 --> 00:10:39,063
No, you don't have
to do that.

00:10:39,063 --> 00:10:40,565
All right.

00:10:42,667 --> 00:10:46,837
I got to run.
Okay, bye-bye. Bye.

00:10:46,837 --> 00:10:48,506
Your daughter Ellie
is one of the girls

00:10:48,506 --> 00:10:50,575
who may be missing.
I'm so sorry.

00:10:50,575 --> 00:10:52,210
Well, you know,
I had to call my ex-wife Nancy,

00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:53,911
tell her that, you know,
Ellie's in Vegas.

00:10:53,911 --> 00:10:56,147
Left out the real trouble
that she might be in.

00:10:56,147 --> 00:10:57,215
Nancy's flying out?

00:10:57,215 --> 00:10:59,016
Yeah, tonight.

00:10:59,016 --> 00:11:00,918
You know, ever since Ellie's
been in Vegas,

00:11:00,918 --> 00:11:02,653
I've been trying
to track her down.

00:11:02,653 --> 00:11:04,488
Just to reach out,
connect, you know?

00:11:04,488 --> 00:11:06,591
When I saw that picture,
I mean, it was

00:11:06,591 --> 00:11:08,226
like a stab in my heart.

00:11:08,226 --> 00:11:11,429
Okay, look, you said yourself,
we don't know for sure

00:11:11,429 --> 00:11:12,964
that something's happened
to these girls.

00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:14,599
But we know what happened
to one of them.

00:11:14,599 --> 00:11:16,734
All right, look,
we-we have this information.

00:11:16,734 --> 00:11:18,569
We'll get it out
to everybody.

00:11:18,569 --> 00:11:20,638
Now, if Angela's right
and these girls are in danger,

00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:23,841
we'll find them.

00:11:23,841 --> 00:11:25,676
WOMAN:
<i>I called as soon</i>
<i>as the hospital</i>

00:11:25,676 --> 00:11:28,179
received a missing persons
photo from your office.

00:11:28,179 --> 00:11:30,014
So, you say her name
is Teresa Hill?

00:11:30,014 --> 00:11:31,616
Mm-hmm.

00:11:31,616 --> 00:11:32,984
It's nice to finally
have her name.

00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:34,885
Oh, so she came in
as a Jane Doe?

00:11:34,885 --> 00:11:36,721
Two weeks ago.
Been here ever since.

00:11:36,721 --> 00:11:38,489
She was found
in the alley

00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:41,225
behind the motel,
strangled and left for dead.

00:11:41,225 --> 00:11:42,927
Well, I'm sure
she's been processed,

00:11:42,927 --> 00:11:45,129
but I'm gonna need
to examine her on my own.

00:11:45,129 --> 00:11:46,731
I understand;
do what you need to do.

00:11:46,731 --> 00:11:47,965
Okay, thanks.
Mm-hmm.

00:11:51,769 --> 00:11:53,671
(monitor beeping)

00:11:55,706 --> 00:11:57,508
Hey.
Hey.

00:11:58,609 --> 00:12:00,911
That from the evidence locker?

00:12:00,911 --> 00:12:02,546
Personal items.

00:12:02,546 --> 00:12:04,815
Day shift collected them
when they were processing her.

00:12:04,815 --> 00:12:06,751
According to Angela,

00:12:06,751 --> 00:12:09,553
Teresa advertised online.

00:12:09,553 --> 00:12:12,056
Her angle was that she claimed
to be a virgin,

00:12:12,056 --> 00:12:14,825
auctioning off her virtue.

00:12:14,825 --> 00:12:16,427
(shutter clicks)

00:12:16,427 --> 00:12:18,696
Typical hooker stuff.

00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:20,631
Condoms, lipstick...

00:12:23,801 --> 00:12:25,770
(gasps)

00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:27,004
What is it?

00:12:27,004 --> 00:12:28,706
Charm bracelet...

00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,975
with a gold heart pendant,
just like the one

00:12:30,975 --> 00:12:33,511
Doc took out of Megan Ramirez.

00:12:34,845 --> 00:12:37,615
There are no coincidences,
right?

00:12:37,615 --> 00:12:39,550
(phone chirps)

00:12:41,819 --> 00:12:44,088
It's Nick;
he's following up

00:12:44,088 --> 00:12:45,923
on one of our missing girls,
Chloe Rudolph.

00:12:45,923 --> 00:12:47,825
They find her?
Yeah.

00:12:47,825 --> 00:12:50,828
Like you said, no coincidences.

00:12:58,602 --> 00:13:01,505
SANDERS:
Whoa, you sure
weren't kidding.

00:13:01,505 --> 00:13:03,908
How long do you think
she's been like this?
About 12 hours,

00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,209
I guess.

00:13:05,209 --> 00:13:07,011
She seems to be in full rigor.

00:13:07,011 --> 00:13:09,046
You know, Angela Banner's file

00:13:09,046 --> 00:13:11,048
said that Chloe
Rudolph here worked

00:13:11,048 --> 00:13:13,984
for a food fetish porn site.

00:13:13,984 --> 00:13:16,454
People paid to
watch her eat.

00:13:16,454 --> 00:13:19,690
The, uh, camera went live
about an hour ago.

00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:21,158
That's when the calls
started coming in,

00:13:21,158 --> 00:13:22,526
and the ISP

00:13:22,526 --> 00:13:23,794
traced it back to this address.

00:13:23,794 --> 00:13:25,062
This her place?

00:13:25,062 --> 00:13:26,664
No, it's her boyfriend's.

00:13:26,664 --> 00:13:28,199
And where is he?
He's in the freezer,

00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:30,067
chilling with the ice cream.

00:13:43,681 --> 00:13:47,151
(freezer closes)
Well, boyfriend's C.O.D.
is obvious.

00:13:47,151 --> 00:13:49,720
What about hers?

00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,589
Well, petechial hemorrhaging
suggests

00:13:51,589 --> 00:13:54,859
that she choked on dessert,

00:13:54,859 --> 00:13:57,661
but that's not
your typical chocolate.

00:13:57,661 --> 00:13:59,497
<i>Schistocerca gregaria.</i>

00:14:00,731 --> 00:14:02,633
Chocolate-covered locust.

00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:05,202
Just when you thought it
couldn't get any sicker.

00:14:15,079 --> 00:14:17,882
Wonder if there's
a spider inside.

00:14:19,617 --> 00:14:21,485
Not this time.

00:14:22,553 --> 00:14:23,888
Well,

00:14:23,888 --> 00:14:25,589
that's three
bodies now, Greg.

00:14:25,589 --> 00:14:27,992
And another one clinging to life
in the hospital.

00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:30,194
We got ourselves a serial.

00:14:34,198 --> 00:14:37,001
I don't think we're looking
at death by chocolate.

00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,536
Hyoid bone's broken.

00:14:38,536 --> 00:14:40,771
She was strangled.

00:14:40,771 --> 00:14:43,841
M.O.'s with the female victims
is consistent.

00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,075
HODGES:
As are other elements

00:14:45,075 --> 00:14:46,877
of the killer's signature.

00:14:46,877 --> 00:14:50,181
I did notice this odd pattern
of abrasions on her back.

00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:55,886
(device whirring)

00:14:55,886 --> 00:14:58,689
That's disturbing.

00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:02,126
"Thou shalt not
bear false witness."

00:15:02,126 --> 00:15:03,828
That's from the
Ten Commandments, right?

00:15:03,828 --> 00:15:05,429
Number nine, I think.

00:15:05,429 --> 00:15:06,764
The lettering
is so defined.

00:15:06,764 --> 00:15:08,199
(beeps)

00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:10,201
To do something like this,

00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:11,702
you'd have to create

00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:13,170
the bruises under the skin

00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:14,839
right around the time of death,

00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:15,940
knowing that they'd only

00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:18,042
be visible during autopsy.

00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,777
He wanted us to see this.

00:15:19,777 --> 00:15:22,646
Here, now.

00:15:22,646 --> 00:15:23,914
Talk about a signature.

00:15:23,914 --> 00:15:25,216
RUSSELL:
<i>Religious references,</i>

00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:27,618
Bibles, wooden...

00:15:27,618 --> 00:15:30,154
whatever the hell these are,
bugs, gold hearts...

00:15:30,154 --> 00:15:32,990
Yeah, usually a killer
has one signature.

00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:34,792
This guy is all over the page.

00:15:34,792 --> 00:15:36,160
He doesn't seem to have a
specific type, either.

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,962
I mean, he's even killed
a guy now, right?

00:15:37,962 --> 00:15:39,530
A pimp.

00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:41,999
All right, so based on
what Angela told us,

00:15:41,999 --> 00:15:44,535
the seven girls who seem
to have gone missing

00:15:44,535 --> 00:15:46,670
all disappeared
around the same time.

00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:48,472
Eight weeks ago.

00:15:48,472 --> 00:15:51,675
Now the guy's dropping bodies
on his own time table.

00:15:51,675 --> 00:15:53,611
FINLAY:
Two weeks ago,
Teresa Hill

00:15:53,611 --> 00:15:55,913
<i>is found strangled, survives.</i>

00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,214
<i>Last night, Megan Ramirez</i>

00:15:57,214 --> 00:15:59,049
<i>is found dead on a porn stage.</i>

00:15:59,049 --> 00:16:01,619
RUSSELL:
<i>This afternoon,</i>
<i>Chloe Rudolph dead</i>

00:16:01,619 --> 00:16:03,053
<i>with her pimp in the kitchen.</i>

00:16:03,053 --> 00:16:04,655
In flagrante delicto.

00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,558
Death by chocolate.

00:16:07,558 --> 00:16:09,093
Yeah, do you mind
not sitting on that, please?

00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,998
Sorry.

00:16:13,998 --> 00:16:16,534
You got any issues
with the couch?

00:16:16,534 --> 00:16:18,569
No, no, knock yourself out.

00:16:18,569 --> 00:16:20,938
Does anybody else think
it's odd that, um,

00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:25,142
the killer didn't actually kill
the first girl?

00:16:25,142 --> 00:16:26,577
Maybe he was interrupted.

00:16:26,577 --> 00:16:28,546
The alley crime scene
was not staged.

00:16:28,546 --> 00:16:29,647
RUSSELL:
I don't think so.

00:16:29,647 --> 00:16:31,115
I think the guy's methodical.

00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,951
I think he wanted us
to find her the way we did.

00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:35,819
I actually agree
with you on that,

00:16:35,819 --> 00:16:37,922
based on my research
of the Gig Harbor Killer.

00:16:37,922 --> 00:16:40,624
You've got to admit
there's all these similarities.

00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:41,959
The, uh, well,

00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,994
quasi-religious themes
and the presenting

00:16:43,994 --> 00:16:46,130
of one gruesome tableaux
after another.

00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,865
This is not Gig Harbor.

00:16:47,865 --> 00:16:49,433
Yeah, I know that.

00:16:49,433 --> 00:16:52,102
But, you know,
just-just like that case,

00:16:52,102 --> 00:16:54,505
we do need to start
at the beginning.

00:16:54,505 --> 00:16:56,707
Yeah, Angela came to us,

00:16:56,707 --> 00:16:58,509
concerned about girls missing

00:16:58,509 --> 00:16:59,610
from the stripper church.

00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:00,844
Right, so if we want

00:17:00,844 --> 00:17:02,112
to retrace their steps,

00:17:02,112 --> 00:17:04,214
that's where we need to go.

00:17:04,214 --> 00:17:07,651
MAN:
<i>I'm not here to preach</i>
<i>damnation and hellfire.</i>

00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:09,887
I'm not gonna preach at all.

00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:12,957
I'm just a messenger

00:17:12,957 --> 00:17:14,825
sent here to share my story.

00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:17,861
The story...

00:17:17,861 --> 00:17:19,797
of a man

00:17:19,797 --> 00:17:21,832
who used women

00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:23,834
for his own gratification,

00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:25,502
for the urges of others

00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:27,104
in the almighty pursuit

00:17:27,104 --> 00:17:29,607
of money, power,

00:17:29,607 --> 00:17:31,475
a sweet set of wheels.

00:17:31,475 --> 00:17:33,077
(inhales sharply)

00:17:33,077 --> 00:17:36,180
How's it working out for you?

00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,182
Shh.

00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,551
Not so good.

00:17:40,551 --> 00:17:42,920
That voice,

00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,855
you can call it God,

00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:46,924
you can call it conscience.

00:17:46,924 --> 00:17:49,560
It's what made me see
a different path.

00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,629
Proverbs.

00:17:51,629 --> 00:17:54,031
"Let not mercy and truth
forsake thee.

00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,766
"Bind them about thy neck.

00:17:55,766 --> 00:17:58,168
Write them upon the table
of thine heart."

00:17:58,168 --> 00:17:59,603
Ooh.

00:17:59,603 --> 00:18:01,639
Lord Almighty,

00:18:01,639 --> 00:18:03,173
God...

00:18:03,173 --> 00:18:05,209
writes his name

00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,877
upon your heart

00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,946
because...

00:18:08,946 --> 00:18:11,081
when your heart breaks,

00:18:11,081 --> 00:18:12,816
his word falls in.

00:18:12,816 --> 00:18:14,485
Pray with me,
brothers and sisters.

00:18:14,485 --> 00:18:16,120
Excuse me.
Pray with me.

00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,721
Can I help you?
Yeah, we're with the police.

00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:19,590
Look, I don't mean
to be rude, but, uh,

00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:21,625
a lot of us in here
have had run-ins with the cops.

00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:23,460
We don't want
to scare anybody away, so...

00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,995
if I can help you find
who you're looking for...

00:18:24,995 --> 00:18:26,597
ANGELA:
It's okay, Jake.
I can handle this.

00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,734
Hi, Kitty.
It's Angela now.

00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:32,603
What can I do for you?
SANDERS:
We'd just like

00:18:32,603 --> 00:18:34,772
to ask you and Brother Larson
some more questions

00:18:34,772 --> 00:18:36,106
about the girls.

00:18:36,106 --> 00:18:37,808
LARSON:
<i>There's not a lot more</i>

00:18:37,808 --> 00:18:40,110
I can share with you guys
beside the information

00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:41,645
Angela's already given you.

00:18:41,645 --> 00:18:44,515
Well, you certainly have
a lot of followers.

00:18:44,515 --> 00:18:45,683
How do you suppose
they found

00:18:45,683 --> 00:18:46,984
their way here?

00:18:46,984 --> 00:18:48,852
I don't have followers,

00:18:48,852 --> 00:18:50,554
and the people,
they found their way here

00:18:50,554 --> 00:18:52,856
the same way I did;
they hear the call.

00:18:52,856 --> 00:18:54,124
Brother Larson
takes his ministry

00:18:54,124 --> 00:18:56,827
to the streets, to prisons,

00:18:56,827 --> 00:18:58,896
to shelters,
and those he saves

00:18:58,896 --> 00:19:00,664
become congregants,
and many of them

00:19:00,664 --> 00:19:01,999
are volunteers like me.

00:19:01,999 --> 00:19:03,434
SANDERS:
You happen to have

00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:06,570
a list of names
of the congregants?

00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:07,871
There are no names here.

00:19:07,871 --> 00:19:09,707
Uh, like that sign says,

00:19:09,707 --> 00:19:12,076
"only fellowship."

00:19:12,076 --> 00:19:13,777
(chuckles)
Well, with all due respect,

00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:17,114
your fellowship
is taking quite a hit.

00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,949
I mean,
with two dead women,

00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:21,452
another one
barely hanging on.

00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:24,054
This place is a sanctuary.

00:19:24,054 --> 00:19:26,223
It's outside these walls

00:19:26,223 --> 00:19:27,725
where the souls are hunted.

00:19:29,693 --> 00:19:32,696
Is this your
Great Awakenings Bible, Brother?

00:19:32,696 --> 00:19:33,831
Yes, it is.

00:19:35,866 --> 00:19:38,669
So do you always make it a habit

00:19:38,669 --> 00:19:40,771
to carve your books out
like that?

00:19:40,771 --> 00:19:42,873
When the spirit moves me.

00:19:42,873 --> 00:19:44,508
You mind if I borrow it?

00:19:45,743 --> 00:19:47,211
May it bring you comfort,
brother.

00:19:48,946 --> 00:19:51,749
You know,
I find it curious.

00:19:51,749 --> 00:19:53,984
Women go missing
every single day,

00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:56,520
and the police don't
lift a finger,

00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,056
and yet when one of
their own daughters,

00:19:59,056 --> 00:20:01,024
like Ellie Brass, is lost,

00:20:01,024 --> 00:20:03,427
they will part the seas

00:20:03,427 --> 00:20:05,629
and tumble down the
walls to find her.

00:20:07,464 --> 00:20:09,199
You question my mission,

00:20:09,199 --> 00:20:11,034
I question yours.

00:20:13,804 --> 00:20:17,074
WOMAN:
<i>You know, in the 16 years</i>
<i>that we were married,</i>

00:20:17,074 --> 00:20:18,909
I never saw the inside
of your office

00:20:18,909 --> 00:20:20,544
at the Newark PD.

00:20:20,544 --> 00:20:22,579
Nancy, you know,
you didn't really have

00:20:22,579 --> 00:20:24,181
to fly all the way out here.

00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:25,949
You remember what happened
the last time

00:20:25,949 --> 00:20:28,051
you tried to find her
in Los Angeles by yourself?

00:20:28,051 --> 00:20:29,186
You know,

00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,954
I don't have the will

00:20:30,954 --> 00:20:33,757
to listen to a whole recitation
of my past failures, okay?

00:20:33,757 --> 00:20:35,692
I-I can't beat myself up

00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:37,094
anymore about this.

00:20:38,162 --> 00:20:39,596
Okay.

00:20:39,596 --> 00:20:40,964
I didn't tell you this
on the phone,

00:20:40,964 --> 00:20:43,700
but Ellie had
your engagement ring,

00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,003
and then she sold it
to another girl.

00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,177
I guess, uh,

00:20:53,177 --> 00:20:55,946
she needed the money.

00:20:55,946 --> 00:20:57,681
So you saw her, then.

00:20:57,681 --> 00:20:59,216
Yeah, about a year ago,

00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,752
she stopped by my place in
Jersey City with this guy.

00:21:01,752 --> 00:21:03,887
He seemed nice.

00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:06,456
Really? Did he know
about her problems or drug use,

00:21:06,456 --> 00:21:10,093
prostitution?
She said she was gonna tell him.

00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:15,132
Well, you say Ellie's here.

00:21:15,132 --> 00:21:17,568
I'm here, Vegas.

00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:19,536
What's going on?

00:21:19,536 --> 00:21:21,138
"What's going on"?
I-I'm looking for her.

00:21:21,138 --> 00:21:23,207
Don't you think I know
when you're lying?

00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:29,513
You were a lousy husband,

00:21:29,513 --> 00:21:32,082
but you're a great cop.

00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:34,685
Find her.

00:21:34,685 --> 00:21:37,554
MERCHISTON:
I must say, running diagnostics
on a computer

00:21:37,554 --> 00:21:40,023
seems incongruous
for a man of action.

00:21:42,526 --> 00:21:44,628
You just gonna stand there
watching me like that?

00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,433
I was thinking.
Oh.

00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,969
Hey, I got DNA and prints

00:21:51,969 --> 00:21:53,937
off of Larson's Bible,
and I got a hit in the system.

00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:56,006
Before he was
Brother Larson,

00:21:56,006 --> 00:21:57,441
Daniel Larson
was a street hustler

00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:58,609
working the Alphabets.

00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:00,611
Priors for pandering,
pimping.

00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:02,045
At the time of his last arrest,

00:22:02,045 --> 00:22:03,680
he was found in possession
of a firearm.

00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,015
A .38.

00:22:05,015 --> 00:22:06,516
It's the same caliber
as the bullet

00:22:06,516 --> 00:22:07,951
we pulled out of the pimp
in the freezer.

00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:10,020
Maybe that's his
weapon of choice.

00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,555
It sounds like you've
got your man, doesn't it?

00:22:11,555 --> 00:22:13,190
That might work for your editor,

00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:14,191
but it doesn't work
in a court of law.

00:22:14,191 --> 00:22:15,692
We need a weapon.

00:22:15,692 --> 00:22:18,161
Yeah, and besides,
all of the Bibles and dowels

00:22:18,161 --> 00:22:20,430
at both crime scenes
were wiped clean.

00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:22,132
(beeping)

00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:23,567
Well, this is interesting.

00:22:23,567 --> 00:22:25,903
It looks like
the Webcam broadcast

00:22:25,903 --> 00:22:29,539
of the food fetish show
was turned on remotely.

00:22:29,539 --> 00:22:30,607
How?

00:22:30,607 --> 00:22:32,175
By a computer

00:22:32,175 --> 00:22:33,977
at the Fellowship
of the Fallen Angels.

00:22:35,212 --> 00:22:37,714
(sirens wailing)

00:22:41,118 --> 00:22:43,053
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
where you going?

00:22:43,053 --> 00:22:44,588
I'm going with you, aren't I?

00:22:44,588 --> 00:22:46,023
When the smoke clears,
I'll call you.

00:22:46,023 --> 00:22:47,224
Till then, just sit tight.

00:22:49,693 --> 00:22:52,629
SANDERS:
Well, let's hope our man of God
surrenders peacefully.

00:22:52,629 --> 00:22:56,133
I'll be waiting by my phone.

00:23:02,439 --> 00:23:03,907
Daniel Larson!

00:23:03,907 --> 00:23:06,143
LVPD!

♪ ♪

00:23:37,074 --> 00:23:38,742
LARSON:
I need you to pray with me now.

00:23:38,742 --> 00:23:42,179
Pray on change. Pray on hope.

00:23:42,179 --> 00:23:45,816
Pray on a life
free from the bondage of sin.

00:23:45,816 --> 00:23:48,151
Because... oh, yes...

00:23:48,151 --> 00:23:50,954
(over speaker):
the forces of darkness
will tempt you.

00:23:50,954 --> 00:23:53,156
They will beckon to you.

00:23:53,156 --> 00:23:55,559
They will beckon
to you on every corner.

Stay still!
You need to stay still!
Angela?

00:24:05,502 --> 00:24:07,037
Get off of her!
You don't understand.

00:24:07,037 --> 00:24:08,939
Get off. Angela!
Let go of me!

00:24:08,939 --> 00:24:10,741
STOKES:
Right there. Don't move.
All right, don't worry.

00:24:10,741 --> 00:24:11,875
Do not move.
We're here for you.

(grunts)

00:24:36,033 --> 00:24:39,169
BRASS:
What kind of game are you
and Larson playing, Angela?

00:24:39,169 --> 00:24:41,438
You come to us with names
and faces of missing girls,

00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:42,806
one of them my daughter.

00:24:42,806 --> 00:24:44,941
Right? And Larson's
taunting us with messages

00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:46,109
from the crime scene.
You're wrong.

00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:47,811
Brother Larson and I

00:24:47,811 --> 00:24:49,613
had nothing to do with this.
We were trying to help.

00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:51,014
Mr. Russell, you know me.

00:24:51,014 --> 00:24:52,883
What about the young woman
we found you with?

00:24:52,883 --> 00:24:54,117
The one strapped to the bed.

00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:55,719
She's an addict.

00:24:55,719 --> 00:24:57,954
Detoxing. She can't
go to the hospital.

00:24:57,954 --> 00:24:59,890
Where's Larson keeping
the rest of the missing girls?

00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:01,725
Where's my daughter?
I don't know.

00:25:01,725 --> 00:25:03,760
You're lying!
You know what?
You're the reason

00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,162
Ellie was on the street.

00:25:05,162 --> 00:25:06,863
So don't accuse me of something

00:25:06,863 --> 00:25:08,799
you got only yourself
to blame for.

00:25:10,834 --> 00:25:12,936
I'm out of here.

Please say you believe me.

00:25:17,174 --> 00:25:18,809
Where's Brother Larson
right now?

00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:20,944
I don't know.

00:25:20,944 --> 00:25:22,112
MERCHISTON:
<i>She says she</i>

00:25:22,112 --> 00:25:23,713
doesn't know
where Larson is,

00:25:23,713 --> 00:25:25,215
but I've got a pretty good idea
of where he was.

00:25:25,215 --> 00:25:27,117
And I've got a
concussion to prove it.

00:25:27,117 --> 00:25:29,553
You think she's
telling the truth?

00:25:29,553 --> 00:25:31,588
RUSSELL:
That woman
saved my life once.

00:25:31,588 --> 00:25:34,624
She may have unwittingly
recruited converts

00:25:34,624 --> 00:25:36,726
for Larson, yes, but...

00:25:36,726 --> 00:25:38,161
I do believe that...

00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:41,565
she was genuinely
trying to help those women.

00:25:41,565 --> 00:25:42,599
What about Brother Larson?

00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:43,700
That's another story.

00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,135
One I haven't
figured out yet.

00:25:45,135 --> 00:25:47,804
Well, I have been
giving some thought

00:25:47,804 --> 00:25:49,773
to the, uh...

00:25:49,773 --> 00:25:52,109
to the way in which
the scenes were staged.

00:25:52,109 --> 00:25:54,211
Stage-managed,
if you like.

00:25:54,211 --> 00:25:55,779
Take a look at that bed.

00:25:55,779 --> 00:25:57,647
And the table
and the lamps.

00:25:57,647 --> 00:25:59,549
And then, if you look
at the dessert scene,

00:25:59,549 --> 00:26:00,884
you can see the plates

00:26:00,884 --> 00:26:02,219
and the cakes,

00:26:02,219 --> 00:26:04,054
all ring shaped.

00:26:04,054 --> 00:26:06,790
Even in the alley way,
which didn't appear staged.

00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:09,025
But if you look again,

00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:10,694
you've got a bicycle,
a discarded mirror

00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:12,462
and a shattered clock.

00:26:16,133 --> 00:26:17,868
Just like the wooden dowel.

00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:19,769
We thought they were numbers.

00:26:19,769 --> 00:26:20,871
Zeros.

00:26:20,871 --> 00:26:23,573
He's playing games with you.

00:26:23,573 --> 00:26:26,843
Well, your killer's a
man of many signatures,

00:26:26,843 --> 00:26:29,880
but the one thing that seems
to be constant-- these rings.

00:26:30,981 --> 00:26:33,884
No, they're not rings.

00:26:33,884 --> 00:26:35,752
They're circles.

00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:48,725
why this guy
had multiple signatures.

00:27:48,725 --> 00:27:50,060
Actually, I think
that he got

00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,828
all of his inspiration
from one place.

00:27:51,828 --> 00:27:53,797
Dante's <i>Inferno.</i>

The Nine

First Circle, Limbo.

00:27:56,833 --> 00:27:59,703
We were wondering
why Teresa Hill survived.

00:27:59,703 --> 00:28:01,004
It's because he
wanted her to.

00:28:01,004 --> 00:28:02,505
She's in a coma.
She's in limbo.

You said he was
giving us a show.

00:28:22,192 --> 00:28:25,061
I'd say this looks
more like a sermon.

00:28:25,061 --> 00:28:26,062
Yeah, I agree.

00:28:26,062 --> 00:28:27,697
And he's not done.

00:28:27,697 --> 00:28:29,432
There are other

But how does this

00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,682
It gets us into his head.

00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:47,450
Beyond that,
I don't really know.

00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:49,152
Well, to quote
a famous man from Seattle,

00:28:49,152 --> 00:28:51,187
identifying the killer's
signature is the first step

00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:53,690
in making the hunter
become the hunted.

00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,725
This is why I don't do
interviews anymore.

00:28:55,725 --> 00:28:58,728
Well, considering we have
so little evidence on this guy,

00:28:58,728 --> 00:29:00,864
(phone beeps)
I'll give you
a quote from me.

00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:03,533
Sometimes we have to wait
for a killer to make a mistake.

00:29:05,602 --> 00:29:07,570
I think he just did.

00:29:11,007 --> 00:29:14,477
Brother Larson.
I'm CSI Russell.

00:29:14,477 --> 00:29:15,945
And I'm confused.

I understand I'm being
charged with a homicide.

Three, actually.

Ballistics on the gun
found in your car

00:29:33,129 --> 00:29:36,132
when we picked you up
matched the bullet

00:29:36,132 --> 00:29:37,867
taken from
Greg Lee's head.

00:29:37,867 --> 00:29:40,603
You also used the computer
in your church

00:29:40,603 --> 00:29:43,640
to activate
Chloe Rudolph's Webcam

00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:46,142
so that we would find her
when you wanted us to.

00:29:46,142 --> 00:29:48,778
It would seem
I have enemies

00:29:48,778 --> 00:29:51,648
who seek to undo
my good work.

00:29:51,648 --> 00:29:54,617
Let's talk
about that work.
Mm-hmm.

00:29:54,617 --> 00:29:55,852
We went through
your cell phone,

00:29:55,852 --> 00:29:57,821

photos of women.

00:29:57,821 --> 00:30:00,623
Including all
of the dead girls.

00:30:01,958 --> 00:30:05,128
A shepherd watches
over his flock.

00:30:05,128 --> 00:30:07,964
I think that this
shepherd chooses them

00:30:07,964 --> 00:30:12,102
very carefully for who
they are, what they are.

00:30:12,102 --> 00:30:14,437
Limbo. Lust. Gluttony.

00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:16,973
I think you obsess
over them,

00:30:16,973 --> 00:30:20,744
and then I think you
punish them for their sins.

00:30:20,744 --> 00:30:23,046
It's come
to Jesus time, Brother.

00:30:23,046 --> 00:30:27,717
You tell me where
the rest of the girls are.

00:30:27,717 --> 00:30:29,786
Where is Ellie Brass?

00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:33,690
I am a sinner.

00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:35,692
I am not a kidnapper.

00:30:35,692 --> 00:30:39,729
And I am not...
a murderer.

00:30:39,729 --> 00:30:41,498
And I'm not a believer.

00:30:41,498 --> 00:30:42,732
These are not my crimes.

Look, man, these
girls going missing,

00:30:45,902 --> 00:30:48,138
I got nothing to
do with that.

00:30:48,138 --> 00:30:52,542
My only crime-- my <i>only</i> crime--

00:30:52,542 --> 00:30:54,711

00:30:54,711 --> 00:30:56,212
Selling a

I introduce them

So, you're still a pimp,
is what you're saying?

00:31:06,523 --> 00:31:08,725
And the pictures
I sent online...

00:31:08,725 --> 00:31:11,060
a client who reached out
to my ministry.

00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,962

he picks a girl.

I drop her off at a corner.

00:31:23,206 --> 00:31:24,741

my little lambs have always

00:31:29,913 --> 00:31:31,481
Why should I
believe any of this?

00:31:31,481 --> 00:31:32,849
I confessed my sins
already, pal.

00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:34,818
I will not bear
the sins of others.

00:31:34,818 --> 00:31:36,920
And you prosecute me wrongly...

00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,455
another body will drop,

your cross to bear.

00:31:40,457 --> 00:31:42,926
Besides, if you

Obviously,

00:33:06,643 --> 00:33:08,678
Yeah. I worked undercover

Get him to reveal himself.

this man's a narcissist.

00:33:41,044 --> 00:33:42,745

He likes to brag,

right now in danger

00:33:53,623 --> 00:33:54,991

worried about them.

It's kind of an abacus

They're called

I went down to the bar
