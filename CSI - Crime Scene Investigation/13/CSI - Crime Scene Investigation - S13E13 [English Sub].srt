Ma'am.

You know, Jonah,
we don't have

to be a part of this.

00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:23,505
Yes, we do.

00:00:23,505 --> 00:00:25,741
I'll look like an ass
if we pull out now.

00:00:25,741 --> 00:00:28,944
Besides, I really want this.

00:00:28,944 --> 00:00:32,948
Hey, so did you.

00:00:33,982 --> 00:00:35,451

To be honest, Jonah, I almost
changed my mind this morning.

But then I realized
I have an obligation

Uh, David Hodges.

Um, trace.

00:06:22,964 --> 00:06:24,433
I'm sure you two

00:06:24,433 --> 00:06:25,667

00:06:25,667 --> 00:06:27,569
yeah, so do I.

00:06:29,271 --> 00:06:30,472
Ooh. Boy.

00:06:30,472 --> 00:06:32,307
Hey. How was your flight?

00:06:32,307 --> 00:06:33,542
It got me here.

00:06:33,542 --> 00:06:34,743
Geez.

00:06:34,743 --> 00:06:36,611
It's been a while.
It has.

00:06:36,611 --> 00:06:38,680
Forensics convention in
Kansas City, right? Ribs?

00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,550
That State Department
boondoggle.
That's right.

00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:43,652
The drunken DNA
expert from Chicago

00:06:43,652 --> 00:06:45,187

00:06:45,187 --> 00:06:46,955
(laughs) Freddie Mercury--
not easy to pull off.

00:06:46,955 --> 00:06:49,191
He got booed off the stage.

00:06:49,191 --> 00:06:51,860
The locals started
throwing chicken wings...
Chicken wings. Right.

00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,261
Right.
Before I forget,

00:06:53,261 --> 00:06:54,596
let me, uh...

00:06:54,596 --> 00:06:55,797
Tickets you wanted.
Thanks.

00:06:55,797 --> 00:06:57,199
What do I owe you?

00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,400
No, it's on the house.

00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,601
But let me ask you something.

00:06:59,601 --> 00:07:01,937
Celine Dion over <i>Jersey Boys?</i>

00:07:01,937 --> 00:07:03,572
It's a surprise for Christine.

00:07:03,572 --> 00:07:05,207
In fact, this whole trip
is a surprise.

00:07:05,207 --> 00:07:06,408
She already here?

00:07:06,408 --> 00:07:07,809
Restaurateurs convention.

00:07:07,809 --> 00:07:09,211
She started a bistro.

00:07:09,211 --> 00:07:10,879
With that
and my work,

00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:13,315
it's just been hard
finding time together.

00:07:13,315 --> 00:07:14,883
Oh, tell me about it.

00:07:14,883 --> 00:07:18,186
Yeah, listen, I-I didn't plan
this surprise very well.

00:07:18,186 --> 00:07:19,688
I haven't been able
to reach Christine.

00:07:19,688 --> 00:07:22,190
She's probably still
at the convention, but...

00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,892
You want to
check out the lab?
Sure, yeah.

00:07:23,892 --> 00:07:26,561
And then we can swing by her
hotel and grab a bite to eat.

00:07:26,561 --> 00:07:27,896
Right. Sounds like a good plan.

00:07:27,896 --> 00:07:29,464
I'll give you the
nickel tour here.

00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,401
Victim's a John Doe.

00:07:33,401 --> 00:07:36,204
David didn't find any I.D.,
but he did find

00:07:36,204 --> 00:07:39,608
this pair of cuff links--
monogrammed.

00:07:39,608 --> 00:07:41,977
J.D. John Doe.

00:07:41,977 --> 00:07:44,880
Must have known
where he was headed.

00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,782
Face is badly
disfigured.

00:07:46,782 --> 00:07:49,217
I'm guessing that he was jammed
into that barrel

00:07:49,217 --> 00:07:50,752
for at least a couple days.

00:07:50,752 --> 00:07:53,622
His position
distorted his features,

00:07:53,622 --> 00:07:55,724
as did this gunshot
to the face.

00:07:55,724 --> 00:07:57,626
Were those shots
fired by the kids?

00:07:57,626 --> 00:07:59,361
No, that would be these

00:07:59,361 --> 00:08:01,263
three postmortem wounds
here on the torso.

00:08:01,263 --> 00:08:03,598
Cause of death
was massive damage

00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:05,801
to the brain and brain stem,
resulting

00:08:05,801 --> 00:08:08,770
from this medium-caliber bullet.

00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:14,242
This looks like a bullet wound
in the hand, too.

00:08:14,242 --> 00:08:16,244
ROBBINS:
That's what I thought at first.

00:08:16,244 --> 00:08:18,513
But let me show you something.
Come on over here.

00:08:23,752 --> 00:08:25,220
See how these bones
are broken?

00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,454
They're not shattered.

00:08:26,454 --> 00:08:28,490
Suggests something
slower than a bullet.

00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:29,958
What do you think it is?

00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:31,893
I can't say. There's no
distinctive tool marks.

00:08:31,893 --> 00:08:33,528
But there is this.

00:08:33,528 --> 00:08:35,230
The object driven
through the hand

00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:37,666
has some sort
of head on it.

00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:39,734
You mean, like a nail?

00:08:39,734 --> 00:08:40,936
Same idea,

00:08:40,936 --> 00:08:44,706
but a whole lot bigger.

00:08:44,706 --> 00:08:47,442
Are you sure this was used
to hold wine?

00:08:47,442 --> 00:08:49,811
It's all charred on the inside.

00:08:51,413 --> 00:08:53,381
It's supposed to be.

00:08:53,381 --> 00:08:54,583
Why?

00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:56,918
A toasted barrel
enhances the wine.

00:08:56,918 --> 00:08:59,387
Igniting intense flavors.

00:08:59,387 --> 00:09:02,390
Vanilla, mocha,
toffee, tobacco.

00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:04,926
Not to mention
intensifying the tannins.

00:09:04,926 --> 00:09:07,863
You making this stuff up?
No.

00:09:07,863 --> 00:09:10,966
Elisabetta's family has
a winery in Tuscany.

00:09:10,966 --> 00:09:14,569
They make a robust,
yet refined Brunello.

00:09:14,569 --> 00:09:17,239
Which is just a fancy way
of saying Sangiovese.

00:09:17,239 --> 00:09:18,740
This is why I stick to vodka.

00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:21,576
No exotic terms,
no dissertations.

00:09:21,576 --> 00:09:23,278
You don't know what
you're missing.

00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:24,713
Yeah, well,
tell that to immigration.

00:09:24,713 --> 00:09:26,615
That's not funny.

00:09:26,615 --> 00:09:28,884
Sorry.

00:09:28,884 --> 00:09:31,686
I-I really am hopeful

00:09:31,686 --> 00:09:33,355
about the whole
green card thing.

00:09:33,355 --> 00:09:35,490
I'm sorry.
Yeah.

00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:38,860
Well, looks like our barrel
is made from <i>Quercus petraea,</i>

00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,595
white oak from France.

00:09:40,595 --> 00:09:42,898
Found only in the
Tronçais forest.

00:09:42,898 --> 00:09:44,299
Sounds fancy.

00:09:44,299 --> 00:09:45,901
So, our primary is in France?

00:09:45,901 --> 00:09:48,236
No... what
I'm saying is,

00:09:48,236 --> 00:09:50,906
barrels made from the white
oak of the Tronçais forest

00:09:50,906 --> 00:09:52,774
are extremely rare.

00:09:52,774 --> 00:09:57,245
Meaning it shouldn't be too hard
to find the manufacturer.

00:09:57,245 --> 00:09:58,914
Or who purchased it.

00:09:58,914 --> 00:10:00,749
Hey, Russell.

00:10:00,749 --> 00:10:03,919
I think that we have a lead
on our John Doe in the barrel.

00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:05,854
What do you got?
Stomach contents.

00:10:05,854 --> 00:10:07,689
Guy had quite the last meal.

00:10:07,689 --> 00:10:10,592
Raw whale?

00:10:10,592 --> 00:10:12,193
As in whale sushi?

00:10:12,193 --> 00:10:14,629
Oh, come on,
that's got to be illegal.

00:10:14,629 --> 00:10:16,932
And disgusting and immoral,
but very helpful.

00:10:16,932 --> 00:10:20,235
Last month, LVPD arrested
a Vince Corrado.

00:10:20,235 --> 00:10:21,736
He's a sushi chef.

00:10:21,736 --> 00:10:24,706
Turned out he'd been serving
whale meat on the QT.

00:10:24,706 --> 00:10:26,942
<i>And last night,</i>
<i>he was serving at a mansion.</i>

00:10:26,942 --> 00:10:28,443
<i>Owner's name is Albert Vogel.</i>

00:10:28,443 --> 00:10:29,945
Take these
to the back.

00:10:29,945 --> 00:10:31,379
Do not drop it, okay?

00:10:31,379 --> 00:10:32,781
You break these,
you pay for it.

00:10:32,781 --> 00:10:34,616
Hey, what's
in the case?

00:10:34,616 --> 00:10:36,217
Who's asking?

00:10:36,217 --> 00:10:37,485
Me, and I'm not
going to ask again.

00:10:37,485 --> 00:10:39,554
Sorry. It's, uh... it's wine.

00:10:39,554 --> 00:10:40,855
SIDLE:
Steel crate
under a guard?

00:10:40,855 --> 00:10:42,624
I thought it was
gold or something.

00:10:42,624 --> 00:10:43,858
Well, it might
as well be.

00:10:43,858 --> 00:10:45,360
It's a rare Bordeaux:

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,362
1947 Château
Cheval Blanc.

00:10:47,362 --> 00:10:48,964
Well, I would
sell you a bottle

00:10:48,964 --> 00:10:50,632
if you had 100 grand.

00:10:50,632 --> 00:10:51,833
BRASS:
What...

00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:53,335
100 grand
for a bottle of wine?

00:10:53,335 --> 00:10:54,736
How much is the steak?

00:10:54,736 --> 00:10:56,638
It's free,
if you're on the list.

00:10:56,638 --> 00:10:57,839
And who are you?

00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,240
Albert Vogel.

00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,810
Just the man we're looking for.

00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:03,611
Whale meat on the
menu again tonight?

00:11:03,611 --> 00:11:05,780
(laughs) That's what
this is about?

00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,649
Actually, we're
investigating a homicide.

00:11:07,649 --> 00:11:09,484
(sighs)

00:11:09,484 --> 00:11:11,486
That's horrible.

00:11:11,486 --> 00:11:14,789
Well, I don't...
I-I don't recognize him.

00:11:14,789 --> 00:11:16,358
His stomach tells us
that he was here

00:11:16,358 --> 00:11:17,559
a couple of nights ago.

00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:18,760
Previous party, I presume.

00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,362
You mean "auction."

00:11:20,362 --> 00:11:22,397
I'm an auctioneer.
Right.

00:11:22,397 --> 00:11:23,932
Rare vintages only.

00:11:23,932 --> 00:11:26,735
The past three nights,
I've sold over $20 million

00:11:26,735 --> 00:11:28,370
in wine.

00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:29,738
$20 million for wine?

00:11:29,738 --> 00:11:31,740
Great wine is art.

00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,974
Geez, I thought
it was just

00:11:32,974 --> 00:11:34,676
something you drank
with Italian food.

00:11:34,676 --> 00:11:36,211
SIDLE:
Well, uh,

00:11:36,211 --> 00:11:38,246
your guest was wearing
these cuff links.

00:11:38,246 --> 00:11:39,514
Do you recognize them?

00:11:40,582 --> 00:11:41,983
These belong to Jack Davari.

00:11:44,386 --> 00:11:46,388
Is he a friend?
More of a client.

00:11:46,388 --> 00:11:49,624
He's one of the premier
wine collectors in the world.

00:11:49,624 --> 00:11:51,526
Really? Well,
someone shot him

00:11:51,526 --> 00:11:53,628
and collected him
in a barrel.

00:11:53,628 --> 00:11:54,863
Two nights ago.

00:11:54,863 --> 00:11:56,831
Well, that's horrible.

00:11:56,831 --> 00:11:58,633
Jack is a good man.

00:11:58,633 --> 00:12:00,802
Well, he has
a remarkable palate.

00:12:00,802 --> 00:12:02,771
Once, in a double blind tasting,

00:12:02,771 --> 00:12:06,641
he picked out the region,
the vintage and the winemaker.

00:12:06,641 --> 00:12:07,842
It was extraordinary.

00:12:07,842 --> 00:12:09,911
Any idea
who might have killed him?

00:12:09,911 --> 00:12:13,348
Well, this business can be
vicious, but a... a murder?

00:12:13,348 --> 00:12:15,417
I-I... I don't think so.

00:12:15,417 --> 00:12:16,918
So, was Jack acting erratically,

00:12:16,918 --> 00:12:19,254
or, uh, anything odd
about his behavior that night?

00:12:19,254 --> 00:12:21,956
Well, he had a bit of a row

00:12:21,956 --> 00:12:23,825
with, uh, Marc Ratelle, but...

00:12:23,825 --> 00:12:25,226
Who's Marc Ratelle?

00:12:25,226 --> 00:12:26,661
Well, he's
the great-great-grandson

00:12:26,661 --> 00:12:28,763
of Gustav Ratelle.

00:12:28,763 --> 00:12:31,699
The scion of
the Château Ratelle family.

00:12:31,699 --> 00:12:33,735
It's one of the oldest
winemakers in France.

00:12:33,735 --> 00:12:35,470
And he was here
selling his wine?

00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:38,807
Well, actually, he was trying
to buy back a case from Jack.

00:12:38,807 --> 00:12:40,408
That's why
they were fighting.

00:12:40,408 --> 00:12:42,444
Why would he want
to buy back his own wine?

00:12:42,444 --> 00:12:43,912
I mean, why wouldn't he
just make more?

00:12:43,912 --> 00:12:45,346
Oh, no.

00:12:45,346 --> 00:12:47,816
Not... not a 1936
Château Ratelle.

00:12:47,816 --> 00:12:49,284
It is considered

00:12:49,284 --> 00:12:51,386
the best Bordeaux vintage
of all time.

00:12:51,386 --> 00:12:53,788
There are only about, uh,
600 bottles left in the world.

00:12:53,788 --> 00:12:55,190
And Jack
was in no mood

00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:56,558
to sell?

00:12:56,558 --> 00:12:58,960
No, he wanted to put
that case on auction.

00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,628
This is a fair offer.
You will take it.

00:13:00,628 --> 00:13:03,531
At auction, this will go
for a hell of a lot more.

00:13:03,531 --> 00:13:04,933
Jack was right.

00:13:04,933 --> 00:13:07,402
Marc offered him $200,000.

00:13:07,402 --> 00:13:09,604
When it went on auction,

00:13:09,604 --> 00:13:11,272
it made over a million.

00:13:11,272 --> 00:13:12,474
Who bought it?

00:13:12,474 --> 00:13:13,942
An anonymous bidder.

00:13:13,942 --> 00:13:15,510
Do you know why
this guy Ratelle

00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:18,379
would be so desperate to
buy back his own wine?

00:13:18,379 --> 00:13:20,982
Well, the wine world
is full of eccentrics.

00:13:20,982 --> 00:13:23,351
He's temperamental,
he's arrogant...

00:13:23,351 --> 00:13:24,719
he's French.

00:13:24,719 --> 00:13:27,222
Well, now he's our
prime suspect.

00:13:27,222 --> 00:13:30,225
Made a reservation at the
steakhouse at the Mediterranean.

00:13:30,225 --> 00:13:32,327
I think you'll
like it.
Uh...

00:13:32,327 --> 00:13:34,229
Oh, Lord, she's not
a vegan, is she?

00:13:34,229 --> 00:13:35,763
Oh, no, no,
she loves meat.

00:13:35,763 --> 00:13:37,832
She's not responding
to my texts.

00:13:37,832 --> 00:13:39,901
Phone must be dead.

00:13:39,901 --> 00:13:41,503
Can't get a surprise no.

00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:43,571
(chuckling)

00:13:48,276 --> 00:13:50,411
(knocks)

00:13:50,411 --> 00:13:51,713
Christine?

00:13:51,713 --> 00:13:54,816
The desk said
she checked in.

00:13:54,816 --> 00:13:56,184
The convention's over.

00:13:56,184 --> 00:13:57,385
She should be here.

00:13:57,385 --> 00:13:58,653
Mac.

00:14:05,627 --> 00:14:08,196
Christine?

00:14:08,196 --> 00:14:09,397
Christine?

00:14:12,534 --> 00:14:14,235
Christine?

00:14:17,672 --> 00:14:18,973
TAYLOR:
Where is she?

00:14:18,973 --> 00:14:21,976
What the hell is going on?

00:14:21,976 --> 00:14:23,645
I'll call my team.

00:14:29,551 --> 00:14:31,553
(line ringing)

00:14:36,257 --> 00:14:37,825
Damn it!

00:14:37,825 --> 00:14:39,527
Still not answering.

00:14:39,527 --> 00:14:41,729
Let's just wait and see
what my guys come up with.

00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:48,369
Well, I know
what broke the table.

00:14:48,369 --> 00:14:49,737
(grunts softly)

00:14:49,737 --> 00:14:51,306
It's got blood on it.

00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,375
Looks like transfer
from a hand.

00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:56,311
There's no tissue

00:14:56,311 --> 00:14:59,714
or any other blood around,
so it wasn't used as a weapon.

00:14:59,714 --> 00:15:01,449
I think someone came
through the door

00:15:01,449 --> 00:15:02,917
with their hands
already bloody.

00:15:02,917 --> 00:15:04,686
Would account for the smear
on the knob.

00:15:04,686 --> 00:15:05,887
At some point, they grabbed

00:15:05,887 --> 00:15:07,288
this thing, maybe out of

00:15:07,288 --> 00:15:09,557
anger or to intimidate,

00:15:09,557 --> 00:15:12,293
and they threw it
through the table.

00:15:13,294 --> 00:15:15,330
(camera shutter clicks)

00:15:17,532 --> 00:15:19,968
I've got something.

00:15:24,539 --> 00:15:25,740
Check it out.

00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,508
Looks like a man's
dress shirt.

00:15:27,508 --> 00:15:28,943
I don't see any

00:15:28,943 --> 00:15:30,612
stab marks or bullet holes.

00:15:30,612 --> 00:15:33,915
All this blood was
on the outside.

00:15:33,915 --> 00:15:35,617
Didn't soak through
to the back.

00:15:35,617 --> 00:15:37,485
Or transfer.

00:15:37,485 --> 00:15:40,321
Whoever was wearing this shirt
wasn't the one who was bleeding.

00:15:40,321 --> 00:15:42,190
Huh.
Could be our suspect.

00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:43,858
So who's the victim?

00:15:43,858 --> 00:15:46,461
<i>Where</i> is the victim?

00:15:49,631 --> 00:15:51,499
SANDERS:
Marc Ratelle.
47 years old.

00:15:51,499 --> 00:15:53,568
Owner of Château Ratelle.

00:15:53,568 --> 00:15:54,802
Paris address.

00:15:54,802 --> 00:15:56,537
Came to Vegas three days ago

00:15:56,537 --> 00:15:58,873
to attend
the Vogel wine auction.

00:15:58,873 --> 00:16:01,376
He has no criminal history.

00:16:01,376 --> 00:16:03,645
Well, Vegas is always
a good place to start.

00:16:03,645 --> 00:16:06,614
Brass has a BOLO out
for his rental car.

00:16:06,614 --> 00:16:08,783
Ratelle checked into a suite
at the Tangiers on Sunday.

00:16:08,783 --> 00:16:10,184
He booked it for a week.

00:16:10,184 --> 00:16:11,619
According to the guy
at the front desk,

00:16:11,619 --> 00:16:12,820
he had a change of plans

00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,255
and he checked
out this morning.

00:16:14,255 --> 00:16:16,224
Gee, I wonder why.
(electronic chiming)

00:16:16,224 --> 00:16:18,459
What do you got?

00:16:18,459 --> 00:16:19,794
Brass.

00:16:19,794 --> 00:16:21,929
Somebody just broke into
Vogel's wine cellar.

00:16:21,929 --> 00:16:23,331
MAN:
Mr. Ratelle!

00:16:23,331 --> 00:16:25,233
Please!

00:16:25,233 --> 00:16:26,801
Calm down!
Oh, what?

00:16:26,801 --> 00:16:28,303
I watch American television.

00:16:28,303 --> 00:16:29,504
You will shoot me?

00:16:29,504 --> 00:16:30,705
I won't shoot you,

00:16:30,705 --> 00:16:31,906
but I will light you up.

00:16:31,906 --> 00:16:33,341
(laughing):
You would not dare.

00:16:33,341 --> 00:16:34,542
I am standing

00:16:34,542 --> 00:16:36,511
in a pool of water!
Water?

00:16:36,511 --> 00:16:38,313
You mean wine.

00:16:38,313 --> 00:16:40,381
I mean...

00:16:40,381 --> 00:16:42,483
what I mean.

00:16:43,785 --> 00:16:45,253
Mr. Ratelle, calm down.

00:16:45,253 --> 00:16:46,587
Let's not make this

00:16:46,587 --> 00:16:48,556
into an international incident,
all right?

00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:51,726
Marc! Marc.

00:16:51,726 --> 00:16:53,594
What's going on?

00:16:53,594 --> 00:16:54,929
First you want
to buy back your wine,

00:16:54,929 --> 00:16:56,431
now you want to destroy it all?

00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,535
Okay, Officer Mitchell,
light him up.

00:17:00,535 --> 00:17:01,736
Don't bother.

00:17:01,736 --> 00:17:04,339
I surrender.

00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:05,540
Huh?

00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:08,209
<i>J'ai fini.</i>

00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:09,677
Hey. Got your text.

00:17:09,677 --> 00:17:10,945
What do you got?

00:17:10,945 --> 00:17:12,480
I analyzed the blood
from the shirt,

00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,715
as well as what
was collected

00:17:13,715 --> 00:17:15,550
from the door frame
and paperweight.

00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,784
All three samples

00:17:16,784 --> 00:17:18,386
are consistent
with a single donor.

00:17:18,386 --> 00:17:19,587
Unknown female.

00:17:19,587 --> 00:17:21,556
Uh... okay.

00:17:21,556 --> 00:17:23,958
We're gonna need an exemplar
of Christine Whitney's DNA.

00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:25,727
I'll call New York,

00:17:25,727 --> 00:17:27,528
have someone go by her place.

00:17:29,564 --> 00:17:31,566
(sniffs)

00:17:34,435 --> 00:17:35,937
(exhales)

00:17:37,972 --> 00:17:40,575
That the wine from Marc
Ratelle's grab and smash?

00:17:40,575 --> 00:17:41,943
Yeah, I'm gonna send
the broken bits

00:17:41,943 --> 00:17:43,344
over to Henry
to run for blood.

00:17:43,344 --> 00:17:44,679
Well, I hope
they tell us something,

00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:46,447
because Marc isn't.

00:17:46,447 --> 00:17:48,549
He's demanding to speak
to the French consul general.

00:17:48,549 --> 00:17:50,184
But guess what I found

00:17:50,184 --> 00:17:51,586
in the back of
Ratelle's car.

00:18:00,261 --> 00:18:03,197
A bottle of 1936
Château Ratelle.

00:18:03,197 --> 00:18:06,467
And, according to customs,

00:18:06,467 --> 00:18:07,969
this little bottle
here is worth--

00:18:07,969 --> 00:18:09,404
wait for it--

00:18:09,404 --> 00:18:10,905
$82,000.

00:18:10,905 --> 00:18:12,306
Totally insane.

00:18:12,306 --> 00:18:13,508
Well, I'm about to make you

00:18:13,508 --> 00:18:14,942
even more insane.

00:18:14,942 --> 00:18:16,811
Something is rotten
in the state of Bordeaux.

00:18:16,811 --> 00:18:20,681
You may be holding
a genuine '36 Château Ratelle,

00:18:20,681 --> 00:18:22,817
but all the wine
that was found

00:18:22,817 --> 00:18:24,352
at the grab and smash--

00:18:24,352 --> 00:18:25,820
I don't think
it's the genuine article.

00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:28,890
It doesn't smell right.

00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:31,225
I know these labels
match, but...

00:18:31,225 --> 00:18:32,960
the whole thing seems off.

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,562
So, it's fake?

00:18:34,562 --> 00:18:36,731
According to your
impeccable sense of taste

00:18:36,731 --> 00:18:40,234
and your oenological
olfactory acuity?

00:18:40,234 --> 00:18:41,436
I like that.

00:18:41,436 --> 00:18:42,637
But you're right.

00:18:42,637 --> 00:18:45,506
We need more
than my palate and nose.

00:18:45,506 --> 00:18:47,975
We need science.

00:18:47,975 --> 00:18:49,477
You're not gonna...

00:18:49,477 --> 00:18:50,678
Hodges!

00:18:52,213 --> 00:18:55,950
That's $82,000
worth of...

00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:57,919
(sniffs)

00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,587
Evidence.

00:18:59,587 --> 00:19:01,889
(Brody laughing)

00:19:01,889 --> 00:19:04,759
Oh, my God.

00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:07,361
This is so good.

00:19:07,361 --> 00:19:08,963
I have to give it to you.
Mm-hmm.

00:19:08,963 --> 00:19:11,766
And this is so
against the rules.

00:19:11,766 --> 00:19:13,267
I love it.
(chuckles)

00:19:13,267 --> 00:19:14,635
Well, as the Italians say,

00:19:14,635 --> 00:19:16,204
the only way
to live a little

00:19:16,204 --> 00:19:17,605
is to cheat a little.

00:19:17,605 --> 00:19:19,440
Hmm?

00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,675
(sniffs)

00:19:20,675 --> 00:19:22,777
Tobacco, cedar,

00:19:22,777 --> 00:19:24,912
mocha, leather...

00:19:24,912 --> 00:19:27,582
hints of cassis,
cherries...

00:19:27,582 --> 00:19:29,383
You are really serious.

00:19:29,383 --> 00:19:31,319
So is this.
This is the real deal.

00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:32,520
(printer hums)

00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,789
Huh.
What does the GCMS say?

00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:38,526
Wow.

00:19:38,526 --> 00:19:40,294
The wine
from the smashed bottles

00:19:40,294 --> 00:19:42,363
contains presence
of radioactive isotopes.

00:19:42,363 --> 00:19:43,564
So?

00:19:43,564 --> 00:19:45,433
So it suggests
a vintage

00:19:45,433 --> 00:19:46,934
that's more recent than 1936.

00:19:46,934 --> 00:19:48,803
One born of the nuclear age.

00:19:50,705 --> 00:19:52,673
HODGES:
<i>After World War II,</i>

00:19:52,673 --> 00:19:54,809
<i>with the advent</i>
<i>of nuclear testing,</i>

00:19:54,809 --> 00:19:57,245
<i>fallout changed the chemistry</i>

00:19:57,245 --> 00:20:00,515
<i>of the soil</i>
<i>all around the globe.</i>

00:20:00,515 --> 00:20:03,518
Specifically, with the ratio
of carbon-14 to carbon-12,

00:20:03,518 --> 00:20:06,888
which makes its way
into wine through grapes.

00:20:06,888 --> 00:20:08,656
I guess now we know why Ratelle

00:20:08,656 --> 00:20:11,492
was smashing bottles
in the wine cellar.

00:20:11,492 --> 00:20:13,361
They were counterfeit.
Mm-hmm.

00:20:13,361 --> 00:20:15,463
Could be the same story

00:20:15,463 --> 00:20:17,298
for the case of '36 Ratelle

00:20:17,298 --> 00:20:18,499
that was for auction.

00:20:18,499 --> 00:20:21,502
If he knew
that it was fake,

00:20:21,502 --> 00:20:22,904
why would he do that?

00:20:22,904 --> 00:20:24,338
Monsieur Ratelle,

00:20:24,338 --> 00:20:26,440
the consul general
is on his way.

00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,842
But while we wait
in the meantime,

00:20:27,842 --> 00:20:29,277
I hope you'll indulge me.

00:20:29,277 --> 00:20:30,845
I... I'm a curious guy,

00:20:30,845 --> 00:20:33,681
and something about this
just isn't adding up.

00:20:33,681 --> 00:20:36,317
So, Jack Davari is
making counterfeit

00:20:36,317 --> 00:20:39,320
1936 Château Ratelle.

00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,922
You find out about it,
you get angry.

00:20:40,922 --> 00:20:42,890
I mean, you're a...
you're a fiery kind of guy.

00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:44,559
You go to see him,

00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,227
things get
out of hand...

00:20:46,227 --> 00:20:47,495
you killed him.

00:20:47,495 --> 00:20:49,230
I mean, I get
that part, I do.

00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:51,332
But what I don't get is why

00:20:51,332 --> 00:20:53,501
you first offered
to pay him $200,000

00:20:53,501 --> 00:20:56,971
for a case of what you knew
was just grape juice.

00:20:56,971 --> 00:20:59,507
I was defending my family honor.

00:21:00,675 --> 00:21:01,909
You would not understand.

00:21:01,909 --> 00:21:03,911
Why don't you give me a try?

00:21:03,911 --> 00:21:05,313
I am...

00:21:05,313 --> 00:21:07,248
the descendant of a family

00:21:07,248 --> 00:21:10,184
that has been producing
fine wine in Bordeaux

00:21:10,184 --> 00:21:11,619
since the age of Napoleon.

00:21:11,619 --> 00:21:13,220
We have witnessed war,

00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,755
drought, pestilence,

00:21:14,755 --> 00:21:15,957
California Merlot...

00:21:15,957 --> 00:21:17,358
(chuckles)

00:21:17,358 --> 00:21:18,893
...and we have survived
them all.

00:21:18,893 --> 00:21:20,461
And you couldn't survive
one schmuck

00:21:20,461 --> 00:21:21,963
who was watering down
your brand?

00:21:21,963 --> 00:21:23,664
Brand?

00:21:23,664 --> 00:21:25,566
(laughing):
We... we are not talking

00:21:25,566 --> 00:21:28,703
about a six-pack of beer.

00:21:28,703 --> 00:21:30,504
<i>Le trente-six</i> Ratelle

00:21:30,504 --> 00:21:32,640
is the finest vintage produced

00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,308
in Bordeaux in the last century.

00:21:34,308 --> 00:21:36,577
Only 1,200 bottles
were ever produced.

00:21:36,577 --> 00:21:40,247
Only 609 bottles are left
in the entire world.

00:21:40,247 --> 00:21:42,383
I-I actually think it's 608.
I saw the lab report...

00:21:42,383 --> 00:21:43,951
This is how I knew
that Monsieur Jack Davari

00:21:43,951 --> 00:21:45,586
was passing off
counterfeit bottles.

00:21:45,586 --> 00:21:47,488
So why didn't you
call the police?

00:21:47,488 --> 00:21:49,724
And ruin the reputation
of the vintage forever?

00:21:49,724 --> 00:21:53,461
The only thing more delicate

00:21:53,461 --> 00:21:55,429
than a wine...

00:21:55,429 --> 00:21:57,632
is its reputation.

00:21:57,632 --> 00:22:00,201
So that's why you offered
to pay Davari the money.

00:22:00,201 --> 00:22:01,535
Keep things hush-hush,

00:22:01,535 --> 00:22:03,638
and keep the phony wine
off the market.

00:22:03,638 --> 00:22:06,240
To preserve the integrity
of the Ratelle name.

00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,441
Which is why I may

00:22:07,441 --> 00:22:10,211
be "fiery," as you say,

00:22:10,211 --> 00:22:12,880
but I am no murderer.

00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,382
No.

Not a good combination for me.

00:23:19,814 --> 00:23:21,716
Maybe you haven't found
the right man.

00:23:21,716 --> 00:23:24,385
I found it mixed in
with the broken glass

00:23:24,385 --> 00:23:26,420
from the hotel room.

00:23:28,222 --> 00:23:30,658
Laser-inscribed serial number.

00:23:30,658 --> 00:23:33,461
Should get us to the owner.

00:23:37,631 --> 00:23:38,899
It's closed.

00:23:40,935 --> 00:23:42,536
I don't think so.

00:23:51,312 --> 00:23:52,546
Safe's wide open.

00:23:54,615 --> 00:23:56,350
We got a body.

00:23:59,787 --> 00:24:01,188
Got a pool of blood.

00:24:01,188 --> 00:24:03,557
Blood leading out the back door.

00:24:06,827 --> 00:24:08,829
That looks like two
to the chest.

00:24:10,931 --> 00:24:12,366
Got something.

00:24:17,605 --> 00:24:19,540
Christine's phone.

00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,709
She was here.

00:24:26,213 --> 00:24:28,449
STOKES:
The jewelry store owner's name
was Ronald Sadat.

00:24:28,449 --> 00:24:29,884
52, no family.

00:24:29,884 --> 00:24:32,887
But he did leave behind
one interested party.

00:24:32,887 --> 00:24:35,623
LVPD investigated Sadat
for money laundering

00:24:35,623 --> 00:24:37,391
three years ago,
but the case was dropped

00:24:37,391 --> 00:24:38,626
for lack of evidence.

00:24:38,626 --> 00:24:40,628
Now, the crime scene suggests

00:24:40,628 --> 00:24:43,564
a-a robbery gone bad.
He-he pulls a gun out

00:24:43,564 --> 00:24:45,699
from behind the counter,
fires two shots--

00:24:45,699 --> 00:24:47,601
one hit,
one miss.

00:24:47,601 --> 00:24:49,970
And you found Christine's cell
phone by the second blood pool.

00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:51,605
And the blood did match
the blood

00:24:51,605 --> 00:24:53,474
we found in the hotel room.
Christine's room.

00:24:53,474 --> 00:24:55,309
We still don't have an
exemplar from New York,

00:24:55,309 --> 00:24:57,378
so we-we don't know
that it's her yet.

00:24:57,378 --> 00:25:00,247
(sighs)
What else do you have?

00:25:00,247 --> 00:25:03,617
Okay, we found a print
on the jeweler's safe.

00:25:03,617 --> 00:25:06,487
A hit came back
to a James Boyd.

00:25:06,487 --> 00:25:08,656
Queens address.
Jimmy Boyd?

00:25:08,656 --> 00:25:10,324
Why? Do you know him?

00:25:10,324 --> 00:25:13,327
Boyd manages
Christine's restaurant.

00:25:13,327 --> 00:25:16,463
So Boyd came with Christine
for the restaurant convention?

00:25:16,463 --> 00:25:17,798
No, no. The last I heard,

00:25:17,798 --> 00:25:19,600
she was gonna fire him--
guy's trouble.

00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,535
What kind of trouble?
Gambling debts.

00:25:21,535 --> 00:25:23,237
Hangs out
with the wrong crowd.

00:25:23,237 --> 00:25:25,506
Christine wants nothing
to do with this guy.

00:25:25,506 --> 00:25:27,808
Are you sure
about that, Mac?

00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:29,810
What's that supposed to mean?

00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:31,545
Well, like I said,
we found her cell phone.

00:25:31,545 --> 00:25:33,347
There were quite
a few messages between her,

00:25:41,856 --> 00:25:44,325
She never said anything
about wanting to open

00:25:44,325 --> 00:25:46,327
a restaurant out here--
she's got her hands full

00:25:46,327 --> 00:25:47,528

00:25:53,334 --> 00:25:54,969
pretty flirtatious.

00:25:54,969 --> 00:25:57,471

'Cause that wouldn't happen.
All right,

00:25:59,206 --> 00:26:01,242
all right, let's-let's just
go back to Boyd.

00:26:01,242 --> 00:26:03,244

in the jewelry store,

00:26:03,244 --> 00:26:05,212

STOKES:
Well, the blood trail

led out the back door
to Sadat's parking spot.

00:26:09,884 --> 00:26:11,685
Car wasn't there.
We checked his pants--

00:26:11,685 --> 00:26:12,953
no keys-- so we sent

No, hitting the minibar

00:26:27,501 --> 00:26:30,204
Wait, I thought Ratelle
checked out early.
Not early enough.

00:26:30,204 --> 00:26:32,873
Doc has Davari's
time of death at 2:00 a.m.

00:26:32,873 --> 00:26:34,408
Hotel keycard records
show Ratelle

00:26:34,408 --> 00:26:36,510
in his room
at 1:44 a.m.,

00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:37,878
and he called
the front desk

00:26:37,878 --> 00:26:40,247
at 2:15 to ask
for a wake-up call.

00:26:40,247 --> 00:26:42,549
Okay, uh, I guess we
need a new suspect.

00:26:42,549 --> 00:26:44,318
Well, I may have already
found one.

00:26:44,318 --> 00:26:46,720
I got a subpoena
for the auction records.

00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,657
The anonymous bidder who paid a
million for the counterfeit case

00:26:49,657 --> 00:26:50,858
of Ratelle...

00:26:50,858 --> 00:26:52,359
he's got a name.

00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:53,794
BRASS:
Jonah Drake,
plastic surgeon

00:26:53,794 --> 00:26:55,763
and wine collector.

00:26:55,763 --> 00:26:57,665
Hope you don't nip and tuck
under the influence.

00:26:57,665 --> 00:27:00,334
And I hope this is important,
Detective.

00:27:00,334 --> 00:27:01,936
Because my fiancée

00:27:01,936 --> 00:27:04,538
and I were in the middle
of a romantic lunch.

00:27:04,538 --> 00:27:06,740
We didn't appreciate
being dragged away by a cop

00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:09,310
right as I was popping
the question.

00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:11,445
You two can rekindle
your romance after I pop

00:27:11,445 --> 00:27:12,947
a couple of questions
of my own.

00:27:12,947 --> 00:27:14,381
About Jack Davari.

00:27:14,381 --> 00:27:15,783
You knew him, right?

00:27:15,783 --> 00:27:17,851
Casually, yeah.
Really? You just "casually"

00:27:17,851 --> 00:27:19,753
pay a million bucks
for a case of wine?

00:27:19,753 --> 00:27:21,889
Two hours after that,
you call him up.

00:27:21,889 --> 00:27:24,224
An hour later, he's dead.

00:27:24,224 --> 00:27:25,859
I think you're making
a mistake here.

00:27:25,859 --> 00:27:27,494
I think the only mistake
that was made

00:27:27,494 --> 00:27:29,229
was your million-dollar
wine purchase.

00:27:29,229 --> 00:27:30,698
Look, it may seem crazy,
Detective,

00:27:30,698 --> 00:27:32,199
but honestly,

00:27:32,199 --> 00:27:34,601
a million for a case
of '36 Ratelle?

00:27:34,601 --> 00:27:36,236
It's kind of a steal.

00:27:36,236 --> 00:27:38,505
I bet Jack was thinking
the same thing.

00:27:38,505 --> 00:27:39,907
Which is why you killed him.

00:27:39,907 --> 00:27:41,442
What are you talking about?

00:27:41,442 --> 00:27:43,210
We both know
that the Ratelle is a fake.

00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:44,411
No, that's impossible.

00:27:44,411 --> 00:27:45,612
Samantha and I

00:27:45,612 --> 00:27:47,481
just drank a bottle
of it for lunch.

00:27:47,481 --> 00:27:49,817
Trust me, it was <i>very</i> real.
Yeah.

00:27:49,817 --> 00:27:51,785
Chemical analysis doesn't lie.

00:27:51,785 --> 00:27:54,221
Jack Davari ripped you off--
that's why you called him up,

00:27:54,221 --> 00:27:55,723
that's why you killed him,

00:27:55,723 --> 00:27:57,491
that's why you stuffed
his body in a barrel.

00:27:57,491 --> 00:27:58,859
I called to buy more wine.

00:27:58,859 --> 00:28:00,661
You wanted more?
Why, in fact,

00:28:00,661 --> 00:28:02,663
Samantha and I had an
argument over that.

00:28:02,663 --> 00:28:04,598
What? O-Over buying
more wine?

00:28:04,598 --> 00:28:06,867
Well, I... thought
it was frivolous.

00:28:06,867 --> 00:28:09,269
Spending all that money on wine,
it made me anxious.

00:28:09,269 --> 00:28:11,505
(chuckles, stammers)
I'm sorry.

00:28:11,505 --> 00:28:13,607
I'm from Boston. We don't like
flaunting our wealth.

00:28:13,607 --> 00:28:14,808
Don't worry.

00:28:14,808 --> 00:28:16,677
I'll fix that.

00:28:16,677 --> 00:28:18,278
Look, so...

00:28:18,278 --> 00:28:19,780
can we go?
Yeah, you can go.

00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,949
But leave your pager on.

00:28:21,949 --> 00:28:24,785
We may need to talk
to you again.

00:28:24,785 --> 00:28:26,387
SIDLE:
<i>Hodges called</i>

00:28:26,387 --> 00:28:28,489
every barrel maker in France.

00:28:28,489 --> 00:28:31,725
He found somebody who shipped
four Tronçais forest casks

00:28:31,725 --> 00:28:33,894
to Jack Davari at this address.

00:28:33,894 --> 00:28:36,397
SANDERS:
Whoa.

00:28:36,397 --> 00:28:39,400
This is one serious
winemaking operation.

00:28:46,573 --> 00:28:49,676
More like one serious
counterfeiting operation.

00:28:49,676 --> 00:28:51,912
Davari was making
his own labels.

00:28:54,415 --> 00:28:58,419
Looks like he was using spices
to enhance the flavor.

00:28:58,419 --> 00:29:01,355
Make it taste more like the wine
he was trying to mimic.

00:29:01,355 --> 00:29:03,290
Well, with his
world-class palate,

00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:04,858
I bet he was pretty good at it.

00:29:08,295 --> 00:29:10,831
Doing his own bottling, too.

00:29:10,831 --> 00:29:12,466
Got a corking machine.

00:29:14,568 --> 00:29:17,871
Think I found how Jack Davari
got that hole in his hand.

00:29:17,871 --> 00:29:20,841
(grunting, screams)

00:29:20,841 --> 00:29:23,844
Somebody wiped that down.
Mm-hmm.

00:29:28,282 --> 00:29:29,883
Missed a spot.

00:29:29,883 --> 00:29:32,553
I'll take a picture
and send it to Mandy.

00:29:34,855 --> 00:29:37,558
SIDLE:
Missed a spot here, too.

00:29:37,558 --> 00:29:41,595
Looks like blood, high-velocity
spatter from a gunshot.

00:29:41,595 --> 00:29:44,465
Somebody tried to clean up.

00:29:47,201 --> 00:29:48,635
Got some more blood here.

00:29:48,635 --> 00:29:50,404
Gravitational drop.

00:29:50,404 --> 00:29:53,440
Maybe from the wound
on Davari's hand.
Or...

00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,642
if there was a struggle, it
could've come from the killer.

00:30:00,447 --> 00:30:02,449
(phone chimes)

00:30:04,418 --> 00:30:05,919
Mandy's on the job.

00:30:08,755 --> 00:30:10,958
I know him.
Tom Scola.

00:30:10,958 --> 00:30:13,627
He wanted to sell me a bottle
of wine for $100,000.

00:30:13,627 --> 00:30:15,629
Let's see what else
he tries to sell you.

00:30:15,629 --> 00:30:17,631
SIDLE:
So, Tommy, here I
thought you just worked

00:30:17,631 --> 00:30:20,501
for Albert Vogel,
the auctioneer, but...

00:30:20,501 --> 00:30:22,369
guess what we found
when we were processing

00:30:22,369 --> 00:30:24,471
Jack Davari's
counterfeit operation.

00:30:24,471 --> 00:30:26,540
I don't know, but I'm sure
you're gonna tell me.

00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:28,308
Your fingerprints.
They were everywhere.

00:30:28,308 --> 00:30:29,776
They were on
the bottles,

00:30:29,776 --> 00:30:31,645
they were on the barrels,

00:30:31,645 --> 00:30:34,481
they were on the phony labels,
they were on

00:30:34,481 --> 00:30:37,351
the corking machine that punched
a hole in Jack Davari's hand

00:30:37,351 --> 00:30:40,521
right before a bullet punched
a hole in his face, so...

00:30:40,521 --> 00:30:41,788
what happened?

00:30:41,788 --> 00:30:43,323
Did you guys have a falling out?

00:30:43,323 --> 00:30:44,658
I would never kill Jack.

00:30:44,658 --> 00:30:46,193
We were friends, okay?

00:30:46,193 --> 00:30:47,794
I find that kind of hard
to believe.

00:30:47,794 --> 00:30:49,863
Jack ran around
in $5,000 tuxedos,

00:30:49,863 --> 00:30:51,665
and you're a
glorified errand boy.

00:30:51,665 --> 00:30:53,667
I mean, I buy
that he was your boss.

00:30:53,667 --> 00:30:55,869
Hey. We grew up together.

00:30:55,869 --> 00:30:58,672
We used to run numbers
for his dad.

00:30:58,672 --> 00:31:00,407
Then his dad went
to prison, and...

00:31:00,407 --> 00:31:01,775
his mom died,

00:31:01,775 --> 00:31:03,777
so Jack and I needed
to figure out a new way

00:31:03,777 --> 00:31:05,312
to make some money.

00:31:05,312 --> 00:31:06,880
Are you saying
that Jack Davari, the man,

00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,515
is as counterfeit as his wine?

00:31:08,515 --> 00:31:10,184
I'm saying that we had
a good thing going.

00:31:10,184 --> 00:31:11,518
How long you
been doing this?

00:31:11,518 --> 00:31:13,654
About three years.

00:31:13,654 --> 00:31:15,455
We used to wait tables,

00:31:15,455 --> 00:31:17,357
and we'd watch
these rich guys, you know,

00:31:17,357 --> 00:31:19,927
buying $5,000 bottles
like it was nothing.

00:31:19,927 --> 00:31:22,229
So we started stealing
the empties.

00:31:22,229 --> 00:31:24,364
We'd copy the bottle,
the label, the cork.

00:31:24,364 --> 00:31:26,567
Then Jack would find some
cheap wine that tasted similar,

00:31:26,567 --> 00:31:29,369
add some flavor.

00:31:29,369 --> 00:31:30,971
The more we did it,
the better we got.

00:31:30,971 --> 00:31:32,839
Okay, so you work your way
up the food chain.

00:31:32,839 --> 00:31:34,575
You start counterfeiting
rare vintages.

00:31:34,575 --> 00:31:35,876
You get Vogel involved.

00:31:35,876 --> 00:31:37,411
Or, wait a minute,
was Vogel in on it?

00:31:37,411 --> 00:31:38,612
No.

00:31:38,612 --> 00:31:39,846
He had no clue-- he thought

00:31:39,846 --> 00:31:41,548
Jack was some
rich guy from L.A.

00:31:41,548 --> 00:31:42,983
We were just getting started.

00:31:42,983 --> 00:31:44,651
We had this surgeon,
Jonah Drake--

00:31:44,651 --> 00:31:46,353
we had him on the hook, man.

00:31:46,353 --> 00:31:48,422
You know, right after
the auction, he called Jack,

00:31:48,422 --> 00:31:49,823
and he wanted even more Ratelle.

00:31:49,823 --> 00:31:52,426
Okay, so again, what happened?

00:31:52,426 --> 00:31:54,928
Did Jack decide
to cut you out of the grift?

00:31:54,928 --> 00:31:56,330
Or did you just
get jealous?

00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:57,864
I mean, come on,
let's be honest,

00:31:57,864 --> 00:32:00,267
Jack's job was fun--
he went to fancy parties,

00:32:00,267 --> 00:32:01,702
he drank amazing wine, he chased

00:32:01,702 --> 00:32:03,704
beautiful women...
I hate to burst your bubble,

00:32:03,704 --> 00:32:05,339
but I was nowhere near
the warehouse

00:32:05,339 --> 00:32:06,673
the night that Jack was killed.

00:32:06,673 --> 00:32:08,475
Where were you?
After the auction,

00:32:08,475 --> 00:32:10,611
I cooled off at the Acid Strip.

00:32:10,611 --> 00:32:12,546
I was there all night.

00:32:12,546 --> 00:32:15,215
I know the owner,
so you can ask him.
Oh, I will.

00:32:15,215 --> 00:32:17,684
I'm also gonna need
a sample of your DNA.

00:32:17,684 --> 00:32:19,286
(chuckles)

00:32:27,327 --> 00:32:29,730
Hey.

00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:32,733
Any word on Jimmy Boyd?
No, not yet.

00:32:32,733 --> 00:32:34,735
Cops are still looking
for Sadat's car.

00:32:34,735 --> 00:32:37,738
Been reading through
all these texts.

00:32:37,738 --> 00:32:39,606
I can't wrap my head
around the idea

00:32:39,606 --> 00:32:41,675
that Christine was keeping
secrets from me.

00:32:41,675 --> 00:32:43,277
Well, maybe
she just wanted

00:32:43,277 --> 00:32:45,212
the restaurant to be a surprise.

00:32:45,212 --> 00:32:47,547
No, no.

00:32:47,547 --> 00:32:49,283
There's something we're missing.

00:32:49,283 --> 00:32:52,886
Her hooking up with Boyd
and this jewelry store guy...

00:32:52,886 --> 00:32:54,888
none of it makes sense.

00:32:56,923 --> 00:32:59,626
Let me ask you something, Mac.

00:32:59,626 --> 00:33:02,462
How well do you know Christine?

00:33:02,462 --> 00:33:06,933
I know her... well.

00:33:06,933 --> 00:33:09,936
More importantly, I know
what kind of woman she is.

00:33:12,239 --> 00:33:13,674
(sighs)

00:33:13,674 --> 00:33:15,776
When I got shot,
she was...

00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:20,647
she was at the hospital every
single day for six months.

00:33:20,647 --> 00:33:23,483
Russ, I woke up and she
was sitting by my bedside,

00:33:23,483 --> 00:33:25,485
praying for me.

00:33:28,922 --> 00:33:32,192
That is not the kind
of woman who...

00:33:33,226 --> 00:33:36,630
Okay.
(phone chimes)

00:33:39,933 --> 00:33:41,568
They found Sadat's car.

00:33:56,516 --> 00:33:58,518
Pop the trunk.

00:34:12,366 --> 00:34:14,401
It's not her.

00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:31,918
Ran the victim's prints.

00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:33,420
Name's Kim Hasset.

00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:35,689
Two drug priors.

00:34:35,689 --> 00:34:37,290
Last known address-- Queens.

00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:38,959
Like Boyd.

00:34:38,959 --> 00:34:40,427
Girlfriend maybe.

00:34:40,427 --> 00:34:43,296
Suffered a single gunshot
to the abdomen.

00:34:43,296 --> 00:34:46,566
Judging by the amount of
blood, she didn't die quick.

00:34:46,566 --> 00:34:48,568
Time of death?
24 hours roughly.

00:34:48,568 --> 00:34:50,971
Fits the timeline of the
jewelry store robbery.

00:34:50,971 --> 00:34:52,572
She could be our
unknown female.

00:34:52,572 --> 00:34:53,874
Yeah, possibly.

00:34:53,874 --> 00:34:55,976
Still doesn't answer
the question,

00:34:55,976 --> 00:34:57,844
where is Christine?

00:34:57,844 --> 00:35:00,814
We know Boyd hit
the jewelry store,

00:35:00,814 --> 00:35:02,983
probably with
this woman,

00:35:02,983 --> 00:35:04,451
stole this car,
and dumped it here.

00:35:04,451 --> 00:35:05,652
That makes sense.

00:35:05,652 --> 00:35:06,920
Palermo's across the street.

00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:09,623
Boyd goes back
to the hotel, cleans up,

00:35:09,623 --> 00:35:11,258
picks up some
of his personal effects.

00:35:11,258 --> 00:35:13,260
Maybe more
than that.

00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,594
If he was holding
Christine captive

00:35:14,594 --> 00:35:17,264
in the room, maybe
he went to get her.

00:35:17,264 --> 00:35:18,765
So, what's his next move?

00:35:18,765 --> 00:35:21,668
He can't take this car,
not looking the way it does.

00:35:21,668 --> 00:35:24,604
Check it out.

00:35:24,604 --> 00:35:26,273
Gold paint.

00:35:26,273 --> 00:35:27,474
Look at that.

00:35:27,474 --> 00:35:28,842
What, is that transfer?

00:35:28,842 --> 00:35:30,243
Somebody pulled
out of here

00:35:30,243 --> 00:35:31,445
in a hurry.

00:35:33,346 --> 00:35:34,848
Boyd switched cars.

00:35:34,848 --> 00:35:36,917
RUSSELL:
Let's get this paint
back to the lab,

00:35:36,917 --> 00:35:39,786
see if we can find the
vehicle it came from.

00:35:42,456 --> 00:35:43,890
Hey, I ran the blood

00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:45,592
you and Sara found at
the wine warehouse.

00:35:45,592 --> 00:35:47,260
Two contributors--

00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:50,263
our victim Jack Davari
and our suspect Tom Scola.

00:35:50,263 --> 00:35:51,531
What?

00:35:51,531 --> 00:35:52,766
What? I thought
you'd be happy.

00:35:52,766 --> 00:35:53,967
You got your man.

00:35:53,967 --> 00:35:56,369
Well, not according
to the Acid Strip.

00:35:56,369 --> 00:35:59,372
Scola said that he went to the
strip club after the auction.

00:35:59,372 --> 00:36:02,742
The owner, the bouncer,
the bartender and surveillance

00:36:02,742 --> 00:36:04,978
all confirm that he was there
at the time of the murder.

00:36:04,978 --> 00:36:06,646
There's no way, no.

00:36:06,646 --> 00:36:08,615
Not only was it Scola's
blood at the scene;

00:36:08,615 --> 00:36:09,983
it was commingled
with the victim's.

00:36:09,983 --> 00:36:11,818
He had to have
killed him.

00:36:11,818 --> 00:36:14,321
There's no other explanation.
It says here
that you found

00:36:14,321 --> 00:36:15,922
heightened levels
of estrogen in his blood?

00:36:15,922 --> 00:36:18,325
Yeah, I figured maybe Scola
was undergoing treatment

00:36:18,325 --> 00:36:19,926
for prostate cancer.

00:36:19,926 --> 00:36:22,529
It would explain why a man has
increased estrogen levels.

00:36:22,529 --> 00:36:24,898
Or he might not be
the one with the cancer.

00:36:26,533 --> 00:36:28,235
I'm gonna need
to get a warrant

00:36:28,235 --> 00:36:29,569
for Scola's
medical records.

00:36:30,604 --> 00:36:32,539
Tom Scola may have done a lot

00:36:32,539 --> 00:36:35,208
of bad in his life, but he did
at least one good thing.

00:36:35,208 --> 00:36:36,977
He was a bone marrow donor.

00:36:36,977 --> 00:36:41,214
SANDERS:
<i>When a patient receives</i>
<i>a bone marrow transplant,</i>

00:36:41,214 --> 00:36:43,650
<i>the sick bone marrow cells</i>
<i>are destroyed and replaced</i>

00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:46,853
<i>by the healthy bone marrow</i>
<i>cells of the donor.</i>

00:36:46,853 --> 00:36:50,257
And since bone marrow produces
blood cells in the body,

00:36:50,257 --> 00:36:52,926
the transplant recipient
begins producing blood cells

00:36:52,926 --> 00:36:54,494
with DNA identical

00:36:54,494 --> 00:36:55,929
to the donor.

00:36:55,929 --> 00:36:57,931
The problem is, it's
hard to find a match,

00:36:57,931 --> 00:36:59,966
but the odds
are better

00:36:59,966 --> 00:37:03,670
when the transplant is
from sibling to sibling.

00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:07,207
Say, from a brother to a sister.

00:37:10,977 --> 00:37:13,513
Your brother told us
about Jack Davari

00:37:13,513 --> 00:37:16,283
not being who
he said he was,

00:37:16,283 --> 00:37:17,450
but he left
out the part

00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:19,219
about his sister.

00:37:19,219 --> 00:37:21,555
SIDLE:
Who went from being Samantha
Scola from Northtown

00:37:21,555 --> 00:37:24,424
to the very uptown
Samantha Wilson

00:37:24,424 --> 00:37:26,693
from Boston, right,
where you were taught

00:37:26,693 --> 00:37:28,528
not to flaunt your wealth.

00:37:28,528 --> 00:37:30,230
Everyone's entitled
to a second chance.

00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:31,698
I agree.

00:37:31,698 --> 00:37:33,833
So how come you didn't
give one to Jack Davari?

00:37:33,833 --> 00:37:36,970
We searched
your Range Rover,

00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:41,975
found blood in the back and
trace from the wine barrel.

00:37:41,975 --> 00:37:46,713
Samantha, this is your one
chance to help yourself

00:37:46,713 --> 00:37:47,914
and your brother.

00:37:47,914 --> 00:37:49,316
Think you owe it to him.

00:37:49,316 --> 00:37:50,483
Because we will
definitely

00:37:50,483 --> 00:37:52,452
go after him as
a coconspirator.

00:37:52,452 --> 00:37:54,321
No, no, Tommy had nothing
to do with this.

00:37:54,321 --> 00:37:56,690
I didn't want to kill Jack;
I just wanted out.

00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:58,592
Out of what?

00:37:59,926 --> 00:38:01,928
The grift.

00:38:01,928 --> 00:38:03,697
We all had
our jobs.

00:38:03,697 --> 00:38:06,232
Tommy had
the connection to Vogel.

00:38:06,232 --> 00:38:08,268
Jack had the polish,
the palate.

00:38:09,603 --> 00:38:12,205
I worked the guys,
softened 'em up.

00:38:12,205 --> 00:38:13,406
So,

00:38:13,406 --> 00:38:14,841
what changed?

00:38:14,841 --> 00:38:16,443
Jonah Drake.

00:38:17,611 --> 00:38:20,347
I fell in love
with him.

00:38:20,347 --> 00:38:22,515
I wanted Jack
to find another mark.

00:38:25,251 --> 00:38:28,188
Jonah was just so hot
for that Château Ratelle.

00:38:28,188 --> 00:38:30,690
He was going to go back in
and buy more of it.

00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:32,892
Was going to walk
into the same scam again,

00:38:32,892 --> 00:38:36,496
so I went to Jack, asked him
to leave Jonah alone.

00:38:36,496 --> 00:38:38,198
This guy's a gold mine.

00:38:38,198 --> 00:38:40,634
Give me a break, Sam, go find
yourself another boyfriend.

00:38:40,634 --> 00:38:42,636
I'll tell him
you're a fraud.
No, you won't

00:38:42,636 --> 00:38:45,572
because then I'll have to tell
him how you pay the rent.

00:38:45,572 --> 00:38:48,308
Not anymore-- I'm out.

00:38:48,308 --> 00:38:49,876
(laughs)

00:38:49,876 --> 00:38:52,412
Once a whore,
always a whore.

00:38:55,248 --> 00:38:56,616
(grunts)

00:38:56,616 --> 00:38:57,917
(Jack murmurs,
Samantha exclaims)

00:38:57,917 --> 00:38:59,853
You work for me.

00:38:59,853 --> 00:39:02,522
I own you.

00:39:05,258 --> 00:39:06,660
(Jack screams)

00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:08,662
Bitch!

00:39:08,662 --> 00:39:11,264
(gunshot)

00:39:11,264 --> 00:39:14,501
I just wanted
to be with Jonah.

00:39:14,501 --> 00:39:16,770
He was going to give me
the life I'd dreamed of,

00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:19,973
help me become
the person I really am.

00:39:19,973 --> 00:39:22,242
I couldn't let Jack
take that away from me.

00:39:23,943 --> 00:39:25,779
You understand, don't you?

00:39:25,779 --> 00:39:27,814
I don't, no.

00:39:27,814 --> 00:39:29,649
Poor guy.

00:39:29,649 --> 00:39:31,484
He only loved two
things in life--

00:39:31,484 --> 00:39:33,687
you and Château Ratelle.

00:39:34,921 --> 00:39:37,424
And they both turned
out to be fake.

00:39:40,393 --> 00:39:41,895
Hey, Russ.
Yeah.

00:39:41,895 --> 00:39:43,329
You got something?
Yeah, I got

00:39:43,329 --> 00:39:44,531
Sadat's car.

00:39:44,531 --> 00:39:45,865
That paint
transfer came back

00:39:45,865 --> 00:39:48,435
to a '95 Ford,
stolen yesterday.

00:39:48,435 --> 00:39:50,804
Now, patrol just picked
up Boyd on Route 16,

00:39:50,804 --> 00:39:52,706
just east of the
Utah state line.

00:39:52,706 --> 00:39:53,907
What about Christine?

00:39:53,907 --> 00:39:55,809
Boyd was alone.
200 miles

00:39:55,809 --> 00:39:57,944
of desert between here
and the state line.

00:39:57,944 --> 00:39:59,412
She could be
anywhere.

00:39:59,412 --> 00:40:00,980
Did you tell Mac yet?
No, I figured

00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:02,382
I'd tell you first.

00:40:02,382 --> 00:40:03,850
I mean, Boyd's at PD,

00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:05,618
but I don't think
it's such a good idea

00:40:05,618 --> 00:40:08,421
to let Mac in that
interrogation room just yet.

00:40:08,421 --> 00:40:10,724
Or it could be a great idea.

00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:15,662
Give us a second,
will you?

00:40:21,434 --> 00:40:23,436
You know who I am.

00:40:23,436 --> 00:40:25,338
Right, Jimmy?
I know.

00:40:25,338 --> 00:40:28,541
I also know that
that NYPD badge of yours

00:40:28,541 --> 00:40:30,343
doesn't mean squat here.

00:40:30,343 --> 00:40:31,544
Where's Christine?

00:40:31,544 --> 00:40:33,213
You want something?

00:40:33,213 --> 00:40:35,448
'Cause I want something.

00:40:35,448 --> 00:40:38,485
This is not a real good
time to play the smart-ass.

00:40:38,485 --> 00:40:39,819
I'm not playing.

00:40:39,819 --> 00:40:42,522
I want out of here,
and I want back to New York.

00:40:42,522 --> 00:40:43,723
You're not going anywhere.

00:40:43,723 --> 00:40:46,192
If I don't go back,
Christine dies.

00:40:46,192 --> 00:40:49,462
You son of a bitch,
where is she?

00:40:49,462 --> 00:40:51,598
Where is she?!
She's in New York.

00:40:51,598 --> 00:40:53,600
That's why I got
to go back.

00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,803
Christine is in New York.
She never came to Vegas.

00:40:56,803 --> 00:40:58,371
What the hell are
you talking about?

00:40:58,371 --> 00:41:02,876
I owe money... to a loan shark
back in New York--

00:41:02,876 --> 00:41:05,411
enough that he's willing
to kill me.

00:41:05,411 --> 00:41:06,880
What's this have to
do with Christine?

00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,549
I needed to use her
to pay him off.

00:41:09,549 --> 00:41:11,317
How?
A few months back,

00:41:11,317 --> 00:41:14,888
the jeweler Sadat-- he comes
into Christine's restaurant,

00:41:14,888 --> 00:41:16,790
he asks me to introduce him
to the owner

00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:18,224
because he wants to build

00:41:18,224 --> 00:41:19,893
another place like that
in Vegas.

00:41:19,893 --> 00:41:21,828
Sadat wanted to invest.

00:41:21,828 --> 00:41:23,630
I knew that Christine
was coming back here,

00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:26,599
and my... my girlfriend Kim--
she looks exactly like her,

00:41:26,599 --> 00:41:29,402
so all I had to do
was just set up the meet,

00:41:29,402 --> 00:41:31,204
rip Sadat off...

00:41:31,204 --> 00:41:33,239
So the text messages--
you're the one who sent them.

00:41:33,239 --> 00:41:34,574
You had
Christine's phone.

00:41:34,574 --> 00:41:36,609
I had her phone,
I had the plane reservation,

00:41:36,609 --> 00:41:37,877
I had the hotel.

00:41:37,877 --> 00:41:40,947
I mean, i-it's just
supposed to be easy,

00:41:40,947 --> 00:41:42,816
you know...

00:41:42,816 --> 00:41:45,185
Where is she?
She's with my brother.
My brother has her.

00:41:45,185 --> 00:41:46,519
You're going to
call him, and you're

00:41:46,519 --> 00:41:48,354
going to tell
him it's over!

00:41:48,354 --> 00:41:50,190
I can't.
Don't play with me,
Jimmy! Come on!

00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:51,524
I... The guy I owe--

00:41:51,524 --> 00:41:53,526
he got nervous
and he grabbed 'em up.

00:41:53,526 --> 00:41:55,662
He grabbed 'em up.

00:41:55,662 --> 00:41:57,630
I don't know
where they're at.

00:41:57,630 --> 00:42:00,266
Okay, all I know is that,
if I don't bring the diamonds

00:42:00,266 --> 00:42:02,802
tomorrow night,
they're dead.

00:42:04,237 --> 00:42:05,438
They're dead!

00:42:16,282 --> 00:42:17,951
I'm taking that bastard
back to New York

00:42:17,951 --> 00:42:19,652
with the diamonds,
he's going to pay off

00:42:19,652 --> 00:42:21,721
the scumbag he owes,
I'm gonna get Christine back.

00:42:21,721 --> 00:42:23,189
Mac, you can't just

00:42:23,189 --> 00:42:25,325
hop on a plane
with a killer and a bunch

00:42:25,325 --> 00:42:26,893
of stolen diamonds.
I don't have a choice.

00:42:26,893 --> 00:42:28,294
I don't have time
for red tape.

00:42:28,294 --> 00:42:29,562
You heard what
he said, Russell.

00:42:29,562 --> 00:42:30,763
She's going to die.

00:42:30,763 --> 00:42:32,265
I heard, I heard.

00:42:32,265 --> 00:42:34,901
I love this woman.

00:42:37,237 --> 00:42:38,705
She saved my life.

00:42:38,705 --> 00:42:42,275
I'm not saying
don't do this.

00:42:42,275 --> 00:42:44,410
I'm just saying
you're gonna need my help.

00:42:45,511 --> 00:42:47,547
I'm coming with you.
