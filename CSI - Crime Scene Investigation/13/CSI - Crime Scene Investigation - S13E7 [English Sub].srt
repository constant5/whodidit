00:00:09,365 --> 00:00:11,300
There's a promise made
in the Book of Daniel.

00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:15,137
"Those who sleep in the dust
of the earth will awake,

00:00:15,137 --> 00:00:16,772
"some to everlasting life

00:00:16,772 --> 00:00:20,443
and some to shame
and everlasting contempt."

00:00:20,443 --> 00:00:21,677
When you are woken,

00:00:21,677 --> 00:00:23,646
among whom will you be counted?

00:00:23,646 --> 00:00:26,882
<i>Before you lie down</i>
<i>in darkness,</i>

00:00:26,882 --> 00:00:29,785
<i>what deeds will you do</i>
<i>in the light, so that you might</i>

00:00:29,785 --> 00:00:33,823
rest in serenity,
in confidence,

00:00:33,823 --> 00:00:37,260
without malice
or owed vengeance?

00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,095
Take heed,
take heed, children,

00:00:39,095 --> 00:00:40,496
while you're still
among the living.

00:00:40,496 --> 00:00:42,465
If one night,
the dead shall awake...

00:00:42,465 --> 00:00:44,567
(echoed, distorted):
shall awake, shall awake...

00:00:44,567 --> 00:00:47,503
<i>How, how, how</i>
<i>will they look upon you?</i>

00:01:07,523 --> 00:01:08,858
Well, that's beautiful.

00:01:08,858 --> 00:01:10,593
BRASS:
Don't let the wings fool you.

00:01:10,593 --> 00:01:13,362
Hanging around in this
neighborhood, she's no angel.

00:01:13,362 --> 00:01:15,231
Yeah, I heard it was
pretty tough around here--

00:01:15,231 --> 00:01:16,732
gangs, lots of drugs.

00:01:16,732 --> 00:01:18,301
Three square miles of felony.

00:01:18,301 --> 00:01:20,803
Even the graveyard
sees its share.

00:01:20,803 --> 00:01:24,373
So a widow comes to visit
her beloved over there,

00:01:24,373 --> 00:01:26,742
stumbles over
the more recently departed.

00:01:26,742 --> 00:01:28,311
Hey, David.

00:01:28,311 --> 00:01:30,313
Died around midnight.

00:01:30,313 --> 00:01:34,216
And he has a single
GSW to the head.

00:01:34,216 --> 00:01:35,618
RUSSELL:
Holy man.

00:01:35,618 --> 00:01:37,386
Ah, this is
the Reverend Rick Renken.

00:01:37,386 --> 00:01:40,189
He preaches at a church
down the street.

00:01:40,189 --> 00:01:41,557
So, what do you think?

00:01:41,557 --> 00:01:44,794
Kneeling, paying his respects,
maybe even, uh,

00:01:44,794 --> 00:01:47,263
brings that plant
there as an offering?

00:01:47,263 --> 00:01:48,864
No, that's from me.

00:01:48,864 --> 00:01:50,466
I put it there last week.

00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:00,409
It's Warrick.

00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:02,645
He used to be a CSI.

00:02:02,645 --> 00:02:04,780
So you think he was
a friend of the reverend's?

00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,182
Maybe.

00:02:06,182 --> 00:02:07,616
He grew up a couple
of blocks from here.

00:02:07,616 --> 00:02:09,719
I mean, he knew everybody
in the neighborhood.

00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:11,754
Ah, it's a shame he's
not here to help us out.

00:02:11,754 --> 00:02:13,322
BRASS:
Let him rest in peace.

00:02:13,322 --> 00:02:15,424
We'll find the guy who did this.

00:02:22,398 --> 00:02:25,234
♪ Who... are you? ♪

00:02:25,234 --> 00:02:28,671

00:02:53,863 --> 00:02:55,831
Nine millimeter.

00:02:55,831 --> 00:02:57,833
But it's been here awhile--
it's all corroded.

00:02:57,833 --> 00:03:00,302
Found this .38--
just as rusty.

00:03:00,302 --> 00:03:02,772
They're obviously not
from this particular shooting.

00:03:02,772 --> 00:03:04,373
Nope.

00:03:04,373 --> 00:03:06,175
So what do you think?

00:03:06,175 --> 00:03:08,277
All the guns
in this neighborhood,

00:03:08,277 --> 00:03:10,279
maybe the reverend
just caught a stray.

00:03:10,279 --> 00:03:12,581
Well, it's possible--
there was no stippling

00:03:12,581 --> 00:03:15,418
or sooting around the GSW,
so he was shot

00:03:15,418 --> 00:03:17,319
from at least
a few feet away.

00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:19,321
So, he's kneeling,
he gets shot from behind

00:03:19,321 --> 00:03:22,391
and the right,
which means...

00:03:22,391 --> 00:03:24,260
I'll check it out.

00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,594
BRASS:
So...

00:03:25,594 --> 00:03:27,630
chapter and verse
on the Reverend Rick.

00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,331
He was single,
lived alone.

00:03:29,331 --> 00:03:31,233
A co-worker said
he finished his sermon

00:03:31,233 --> 00:03:32,802
around 10:00 p.m.
last night.

00:03:32,802 --> 00:03:34,837
So, maybe he took
a shortcut,

00:03:34,837 --> 00:03:37,573
stopped to spend
some time with Warrick.

00:03:37,573 --> 00:03:38,707
Shortcut to
the Holy Land.

00:03:46,749 --> 00:03:49,885
BRASS:
Hey, Nicky. Nicky, hold up.

00:03:49,885 --> 00:03:51,454
You okay?

00:03:51,454 --> 00:03:52,888
It's all hitting
a little close

00:03:52,888 --> 00:03:55,324
to home for me, you know?

00:03:55,324 --> 00:03:57,526
Yeah, I don't know,
to be honest, I haven't been

00:03:57,526 --> 00:03:59,562
back here since the funeral.

00:03:59,562 --> 00:04:00,796
Four and half years like that.

00:04:00,796 --> 00:04:02,198
Yeah, I know.

00:04:02,198 --> 00:04:03,432
You know,
but I miss him, though.

00:04:03,432 --> 00:04:05,167
I think about him, you know?

00:04:05,167 --> 00:04:07,503
Especially on fight weekends
when the Strip is all electric.

00:04:07,503 --> 00:04:09,572
I mean, there's no way
that he's missing this action.

00:04:09,572 --> 00:04:12,308
Yeah, you're right about that.

00:04:12,308 --> 00:04:14,877
So what would
Warrick's move be?

00:04:14,877 --> 00:04:17,112
Do you know
who Aaron Voss is?

00:04:17,112 --> 00:04:18,547
"Ghetto Gotti"?

00:04:18,547 --> 00:04:20,449
Drugs, fear, extortion--
that's his game.

00:04:20,449 --> 00:04:22,318
Nothing goes down
in this neighborhood

00:04:22,318 --> 00:04:23,652
without being a blip
on his radar.

00:04:23,652 --> 00:04:25,287
That's true.

00:04:25,287 --> 00:04:27,156
Let's go hit him up.

00:04:27,156 --> 00:04:31,560
Man usually charges for dishing
out his...hard-earned wisdom.

00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,296
Now, you got plenty of revenue
streams in that neighborhood.

00:04:34,296 --> 00:04:36,465
It's time for a little charity,
a little give-back, huh?

00:04:36,465 --> 00:04:38,367
What do you know
about the reverend's shooting?

00:04:38,367 --> 00:04:39,568
Out of the loop on that one.

00:04:39,568 --> 00:04:41,604
A week ago,
you almost took a bullet

00:04:41,604 --> 00:04:43,706
not 50 yards
from that graveyard.

00:04:43,706 --> 00:04:45,574
So maybe the same
bad shooter came back,

00:04:45,574 --> 00:04:47,376
put a round in the rev, but...

00:04:47,376 --> 00:04:49,278
maybe it was
mistaken identity.

00:04:49,278 --> 00:04:52,314
Shooter'll have to be blind
to mistake me for a holy man.

00:04:52,314 --> 00:04:53,682
No one's mistaking you
for a good guy.

00:04:53,682 --> 00:04:54,884
But the stuff you've been

00:04:54,884 --> 00:04:56,585
getting away with
in that neighborhood,

00:04:56,585 --> 00:05:00,289
it's gonna catch up
to you soon enough.

00:05:00,289 --> 00:05:02,358
This is about
Warrick Brown, isn't it,

00:05:02,358 --> 00:05:04,159
why you're
so interested?

00:05:04,159 --> 00:05:07,263
Little blood on your buddy's
grave got you riled up.

00:05:08,864 --> 00:05:11,100
You know, Warrick and I
went way back.

00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,568
He despised you.

00:05:12,568 --> 00:05:14,203
He said that
you were everything that

00:05:14,203 --> 00:05:15,604
was wrong with
that neighborhood,

00:05:15,604 --> 00:05:17,206
everything that
he wanted to change.

00:05:17,206 --> 00:05:19,642
And what did he change?

00:05:19,642 --> 00:05:22,177
You know, guys like Warrick
and the reverend,

00:05:22,177 --> 00:05:24,179
they talk a good game,

00:05:24,179 --> 00:05:28,851
but who's actually keeping
things together in the hood?

00:05:28,851 --> 00:05:30,853
That's me.

00:05:33,222 --> 00:05:35,157
I'm losing money.

00:05:35,157 --> 00:05:37,226
You're free to go--I'm not
charging you with anything.

00:05:40,796 --> 00:05:43,165
Say a prayer to
St. Warrick for me.

00:05:46,268 --> 00:05:48,203
(distant siren wailing)

00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:02,284
(car alarm whooping
in distance)

00:06:03,719 --> 00:06:05,254
(banging)

00:06:05,254 --> 00:06:06,455
Shh!

00:06:06,455 --> 00:06:08,357
Mommy's sleeping.

00:06:08,357 --> 00:06:10,426
She doesn't like
to get woke up.

00:06:10,426 --> 00:06:11,794
Eli?

00:06:11,794 --> 00:06:13,529
Yeah?

00:06:13,529 --> 00:06:15,598
(laughs)

00:06:15,598 --> 00:06:17,399
I'm Nick.

00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:18,834
Stokes.

00:06:18,834 --> 00:06:21,537
I worked with, uh...

00:06:21,537 --> 00:06:24,840
Well, your dad, he was one
of my best friends.

00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,842
My daddy had friends?

00:06:26,842 --> 00:06:29,244
Oh, yeah, lots of them.

00:06:29,244 --> 00:06:30,846
Man, you're getting big--
I haven't seen you

00:06:30,846 --> 00:06:33,215
since you were
a little baby.
TINA: Eli!

00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:34,483
Come play inside, baby.

00:06:37,853 --> 00:06:39,455
Tina.

00:06:39,455 --> 00:06:40,656
What are you doing here, Nick?

00:06:40,656 --> 00:06:42,324
I don't know
if you heard or not,

00:06:42,324 --> 00:06:46,295
but there was a body found
on Warrick's grave.

00:06:46,295 --> 00:06:48,631
I told you back then,
I didn't want you here.

00:06:48,631 --> 00:06:50,633
Ever. If you ever

00:06:50,633 --> 00:06:54,336
come near my son,
I will call the police.

00:07:15,457 --> 00:07:17,359
(dog barking in distance)

00:07:58,667 --> 00:08:01,270
White powder you found
on the man of the cloth's cloth?

00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,705
Our good old friend Oxy.

00:08:02,705 --> 00:08:04,139
Prescription pain killer.

00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:05,507
The only reason to crush it

00:08:05,507 --> 00:08:07,543
into a powder is
to use it recreationally.

00:08:07,543 --> 00:08:09,445
Holy Man might
have had a habit.

00:08:09,445 --> 00:08:11,814
Well, Tox had him
clean and sober.

00:08:11,814 --> 00:08:15,284
So the fact that it's
on the seat of his pants--

00:08:15,284 --> 00:08:16,852
could've sat in it
while counseling

00:08:16,852 --> 00:08:18,587
some troubled member
of his flock?

00:08:18,587 --> 00:08:21,490
Hazards of an enlightened man
working among degenerates.

00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:23,125
Been there.

00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:24,693
Well, why don't you
enlighten me

00:08:24,693 --> 00:08:26,462
on the trace
from the shoe soles?

00:08:26,462 --> 00:08:29,231
Indigo dye
and calcium carbonate.

00:08:29,231 --> 00:08:32,201
Blue chalk...hmm.

00:08:32,201 --> 00:08:33,502
Guys.

00:08:33,502 --> 00:08:34,837
Where'd you find that?

00:08:34,837 --> 00:08:36,705
Uh, soles of
the reverend's shoes.

00:08:36,705 --> 00:08:38,440
Yeah, I think
I know what this is.

00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,809
I stopped by Tina's house today.

00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:42,878
Eli had covered the stoop
with a big blue sky.

00:08:42,878 --> 00:08:44,646
Reverend must have been there.

00:08:44,646 --> 00:08:46,648
<i>Difficult to avoid stepping</i>
<i>through the chalk.</i>

00:08:46,648 --> 00:08:48,517
Well, wherever he
picked up the chalk

00:08:48,517 --> 00:08:51,386
is probably the same place
he picked up the crushed drugs.

00:08:51,386 --> 00:08:53,388
Oxycodone.

00:08:53,388 --> 00:08:55,724
The last place he was alive
may have been Tina's house.

00:08:55,724 --> 00:08:57,459
TINA:
<i>I said</i>

00:08:57,459 --> 00:08:59,128
I don't know anything
about this.

00:08:59,128 --> 00:09:00,596
Back off.

00:09:00,596 --> 00:09:03,332
Well, the officer can explain
everything outside, Tina,

00:09:03,332 --> 00:09:05,367
but we have to come in.

00:09:05,367 --> 00:09:08,437
Remember Warrick's funeral,
when you and Nick Stokes

00:09:08,437 --> 00:09:10,739
were crying over him,
fawning over Eli.

00:09:10,739 --> 00:09:12,307
And then you walked
right past me,

00:09:12,307 --> 00:09:15,310
you didn't say a single word.

00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:16,678
That was a tough time.

00:09:16,678 --> 00:09:18,380
Yeah.
FINLAY:
Ms. Brewster,

00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,749
we really need you to step
outside with the officer.

00:09:20,749 --> 00:09:22,184
You know, it's not gonna happen.

00:09:22,184 --> 00:09:24,186
Mom, I want to play outside.

00:09:24,186 --> 00:09:25,320
(groans) Eli...

00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:30,759
(sighs)

00:09:40,602 --> 00:09:42,337
SIDLE: This would have
made Warrick sick.

00:09:42,337 --> 00:09:44,473
FINLAY:
Yeah, what a mess.

00:09:44,473 --> 00:09:46,842
Warrick's grandmother
raised him in this house.

00:09:46,842 --> 00:09:49,878
He bought the property.

00:09:49,878 --> 00:09:51,780
Let Tina live in it
after they split up

00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,482
two years into their marriage.

00:09:53,482 --> 00:09:54,683
Warrick was okay
with his kid

00:09:54,683 --> 00:09:56,585
living in this
part of town?

00:09:56,585 --> 00:09:59,221
You know, I don't know--
he was trying to get custody

00:09:59,221 --> 00:10:02,558
of Eli when he was murdered.

00:10:02,558 --> 00:10:03,826
(Sidle chuckles)

00:10:03,826 --> 00:10:05,427
I remember when he
bought this thing.

00:10:05,427 --> 00:10:07,162
It cost him
two weeks' salary.

00:10:07,162 --> 00:10:09,331
I thought he was nuts.

00:10:09,331 --> 00:10:11,266
He was <i>so</i> proud of this.

00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:21,610
Where did Warrick
meet this woman?

00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:23,378
SIDLE:
She was different then.

00:10:23,378 --> 00:10:24,580
She was a nurse.

00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,415
Really?

00:10:26,415 --> 00:10:28,584
Quit when she got
his death benefits?

00:10:28,584 --> 00:10:30,519
That's the rumor.

00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:32,721
Before I went away,
I'd stop by,

00:10:32,721 --> 00:10:35,190
brought some food.

00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,692
House was always dark.

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,096
Eli would be crying.

00:10:41,096 --> 00:10:42,764
She never answered the door.

00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:50,439
Well, these aren't
her jeans.

00:10:50,439 --> 00:10:52,474
She's got a man
in her life.

00:10:52,474 --> 00:10:54,476
I've got some trace--
could be...

00:10:54,476 --> 00:10:57,179
oxycodone within reach
of a child.

00:11:00,616 --> 00:11:02,384
That's not good.

00:11:02,384 --> 00:11:05,320
No name on the pill bottle,

00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,788
but there is a print.

00:11:08,223 --> 00:11:09,558
(shutter clicks)

00:11:19,801 --> 00:11:22,471
(groans)

00:11:22,471 --> 00:11:25,507
A little boy should not
be living here.

00:11:25,507 --> 00:11:26,875
Yeah.

00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:29,745
(phone chirps)

00:11:29,745 --> 00:11:31,847
Lab got a hit on the print
on the pill bottle.

00:11:31,847 --> 00:11:33,348
It's a local.

00:11:33,348 --> 00:11:34,549
His name is Cliff Paul.

00:11:36,451 --> 00:11:38,520
Ag-assault,
domestic battery.

00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,322
He's still on parole.

00:11:40,322 --> 00:11:43,191
She's trying to keep you guys
out of her house.

00:11:45,327 --> 00:11:47,329
CSIs just show up
at my house.

00:11:47,329 --> 00:11:49,164
Ms. Brewster--
Tina--

00:11:49,164 --> 00:11:50,799
we know that the reverend was
here last night.

00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:52,367
So what happened?

00:11:52,367 --> 00:11:54,569
I don't have
to explain myself to you.

00:11:54,569 --> 00:11:56,438
Then how about
explaining Cliff Paul?

00:11:56,438 --> 00:11:58,173
Okay, we know he
was here, too.

00:11:58,173 --> 00:12:00,309
We found his oxy
and his weed.

00:12:00,309 --> 00:12:02,110
Detectives are picking
him up right now,

00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:04,446
so maybe you'd like tell
your side of the story first.

00:12:05,514 --> 00:12:07,349
SIDLE:
No? Okay.

00:12:07,349 --> 00:12:09,551
So maybe Cliff is the reason
that the reverend stopped by.

00:12:09,551 --> 00:12:11,153
Maybe he wanted to talk to you
about having a felon

00:12:11,153 --> 00:12:12,688
in your house?

00:12:12,688 --> 00:12:15,490
You think I haven't heard
what you all did, huh?

00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:17,392
Excuse me?
McKeen...

00:12:17,392 --> 00:12:19,394
the man you let
murder my husband?

00:12:19,394 --> 00:12:22,331
How you CSIs let him
kill other people.

00:12:22,331 --> 00:12:24,266
You stand here
trashing my life--

00:12:24,266 --> 00:12:26,702
Ms. Brewster--Ms. Brewster,
this woman here

00:12:26,702 --> 00:12:28,403
is from
Child Protective Services.

00:12:28,403 --> 00:12:29,705
She's gonna have to take Eli.

00:12:29,705 --> 00:12:31,673
What?
Your home is not fit
for a child.

00:12:31,673 --> 00:12:34,476
Oh, wait, no! Eli! Eli!

00:12:34,476 --> 00:12:35,877
Come with me, Eli.

00:12:35,877 --> 00:12:37,412
OFFICER:
Ma'am... ma'am!
No, no!

00:12:37,412 --> 00:12:38,580
ELI (echoing):
No!

00:12:39,648 --> 00:12:42,417
Mommy!

00:12:42,417 --> 00:12:44,419
(no voice)

00:12:46,788 --> 00:12:48,757
OFFICER: Ma'am!
Come here!
No! No! No!

00:12:48,757 --> 00:12:50,392
Just stay back!
Mom!

00:12:50,392 --> 00:12:51,626
Baby!
Hold on!

00:12:51,626 --> 00:12:52,828
Mommy! No!

00:12:52,828 --> 00:12:54,196
Mommy!
Eli!

00:12:57,099 --> 00:12:58,533
(muffled):
Mommy!

00:13:11,313 --> 00:13:13,749
Cliff Paul, Las Vegas Police.

00:13:19,421 --> 00:13:20,589
OFFICER:
All clear.

00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,708
Found him.

00:13:48,817 --> 00:13:50,452
David still down there
with the body?

00:13:50,452 --> 00:13:51,686
Yeah. Liver temp

00:13:51,686 --> 00:13:54,723
suggests he died
around 2:00 a.m.,

00:13:54,723 --> 00:13:59,828
which is a couple of hours
after the reverend was murdered.

00:13:59,828 --> 00:14:01,263
Reminds me
of those

00:14:01,263 --> 00:14:03,165
dance instruction
floor mats,

00:14:03,165 --> 00:14:05,133
you know--
"learn to tango."

00:14:05,133 --> 00:14:06,635
Can I lead?
Please do.

00:14:06,635 --> 00:14:08,570
All the treads
match Cliff Paul's shoes.

00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:10,172
<i>So he's getting his drink on,</i>

00:14:10,172 --> 00:14:12,441
<i>goes to answer the door,</i>
<i>opens it,</i>

00:14:12,441 --> 00:14:14,576
<i>and he stumbles back</i>
<i>and drops the bottle.</i>

00:14:14,576 --> 00:14:16,144
Steps back through the beer.

00:14:18,613 --> 00:14:20,649
<i>And then a dash to the window.</i>

00:14:20,649 --> 00:14:22,717
Goes right through.

00:14:22,717 --> 00:14:25,320
Two-story drop, he might have
thought that he could make it.

00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,555
Escape.

00:14:26,555 --> 00:14:28,757
But why would he choose flight

00:14:28,757 --> 00:14:30,358
when he was armed to fight?

00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,762
Found it stuffed between
the couch cushions.

00:14:33,762 --> 00:14:35,330
It's a .45 auto.

00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:36,832
That's interesting.

00:14:36,832 --> 00:14:40,569
Doc said the round he pulled
from the reverend was a .45.

00:14:40,569 --> 00:14:43,538
Both of Tina's visitors dead
in one night?

00:14:43,538 --> 00:14:46,508
Could be the piece
that connects them.

00:14:46,508 --> 00:14:48,276
Reverend shows up
to Tina's house, right?

00:14:48,276 --> 00:14:50,112
Cliff's already there,

00:14:50,112 --> 00:14:53,148
probably not all that thrilled
that the preacher butts in.

00:14:53,148 --> 00:14:55,584
Reverend leaves,
goes to the cemetery,

00:14:55,584 --> 00:14:57,619
maybe for guidance from Warrick?

00:14:57,619 --> 00:14:59,588
Cliff follows the reverend
to the cemetery,

00:14:59,588 --> 00:15:00,789
<i>shoots him,</i>

00:15:00,789 --> 00:15:02,524
comes back here,

00:15:02,524 --> 00:15:05,293
tucks the gun into the sofa.

00:15:05,293 --> 00:15:07,629
Somebody shows up at the door,

00:15:07,629 --> 00:15:12,100
somehow drives him out
through the window.

00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,568
It's kind of spooky,
don't you think?

00:15:13,568 --> 00:15:14,836
What?

00:15:14,836 --> 00:15:17,139
Kill a holy man
in a cemetery,

00:15:17,139 --> 00:15:18,807
something follows you
back home,

00:15:18,807 --> 00:15:21,443
something that doesn't leave
any shoe prints

00:15:21,443 --> 00:15:24,412
and it scares you so thoroughly
that you jump out the window?

00:15:24,412 --> 00:15:26,581
Eh...
I'm just saying.

00:15:26,581 --> 00:15:29,317
I don't think it takes
supernatural ability

00:15:29,317 --> 00:15:31,219
to avoid stepping in beer.

00:15:33,889 --> 00:15:35,790
Did you lose a flashlight?

00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:38,493
Sorry?

00:15:38,493 --> 00:15:40,262
Looks like one of ours.

00:15:40,262 --> 00:15:43,265
Definitely not been used
in the appropriate manner.

00:15:43,265 --> 00:15:45,834
The blood is black;
it's not tacky.

00:15:45,834 --> 00:15:47,802
It's older than last night.

00:15:50,539 --> 00:15:53,375
Gravitational drops
just as old.

00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:54,709
Maybe there was
a round one

00:15:54,709 --> 00:15:57,579
before last night's fatal
round two.

00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,503
DNA pegs the flashlight
blood as Cliff Paul's.

00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:23,638
The blood on
the apartment floor

00:16:23,638 --> 00:16:26,241
is from a different,
unknown contributor.

00:16:26,241 --> 00:16:27,809
Well, whoever hit Cliff
with that

00:16:27,809 --> 00:16:30,312
must have gotten a blow
in return.

00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,281
And there it is.

00:16:33,281 --> 00:16:36,184
Printing the battery--
bright idea.

00:16:41,623 --> 00:16:43,158
Let's see who clocked Cliff.

00:16:56,204 --> 00:16:58,106
Warrick.

00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:06,514
(switch clicks,
machine buzzes and hums)

00:17:11,253 --> 00:17:13,488
ROBBINS: Victim appears
to have suffered

00:17:13,488 --> 00:17:15,590
a fatal cervical
spinal fracture

00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:17,626
between the C3 and C4.

00:17:17,626 --> 00:17:19,327
No trauma on his back
to indicate

00:17:19,327 --> 00:17:21,296
he was pushed or kicked
through the window.

00:17:21,296 --> 00:17:22,864
When David washed the blood
from his face,

00:17:22,864 --> 00:17:25,567
he noticed a peripheral wound
on the forehead,

00:17:25,567 --> 00:17:27,869
a few days old,
judging by the scab.

00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:30,205
Blunt, round-edged instrument.
You know something,

00:17:30,205 --> 00:17:32,674
that could've come from
the bloody flashlight

00:17:32,674 --> 00:17:34,542
we found at the scene,

00:17:34,542 --> 00:17:37,245
which belonged, by the way,
to your friend Warrick Brown.

00:17:37,245 --> 00:17:38,513
You're kidding.

00:17:38,513 --> 00:17:40,548
Our, uh, victim here
was spending time

00:17:40,548 --> 00:17:42,217
with Warrick's widow.

00:17:42,217 --> 00:17:44,152
She probably kept
Warrick's flashlight,

00:17:44,152 --> 00:17:45,387
got into a fight
with this guy,

00:17:45,387 --> 00:17:46,888
maybe pulled it
out of her purse

00:17:46,888 --> 00:17:48,890
and whacked him
with it.

00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:51,159
He hardly seems
a worthy successor

00:17:51,159 --> 00:17:52,594
to my friend Warrick,

00:17:52,594 --> 00:17:54,562
in Tina's life
or anywhere else.

00:17:54,562 --> 00:17:56,364
You know, this is
a little bit weird.

00:17:56,364 --> 00:17:59,167
We've been assuming that
Cliff here killed the reverend,

00:17:59,167 --> 00:18:01,169
but if he did,
then why'd the reverend

00:18:01,169 --> 00:18:04,105
write him a check
for a thousand bucks?

00:18:06,174 --> 00:18:07,809
What do you have?

00:18:07,809 --> 00:18:10,812
Internet history
from Cliff Paul's computer.

00:18:10,812 --> 00:18:13,214
I'm trying to establish
a timeline on him.

00:18:13,214 --> 00:18:15,817
You know, Cliff didn't really
strike me as the computer type.

00:18:15,817 --> 00:18:18,753
No, just the "lots and lots
of free porn" type.

00:18:18,753 --> 00:18:21,356
Oh.
Hidden cameras,

00:18:21,356 --> 00:18:23,124
hot school girls,
daddy/daughter.

00:18:23,124 --> 00:18:24,359
Filthy.

00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:26,528
Ironically,
it cleanses him.

00:18:26,528 --> 00:18:28,263
He was active online

00:18:28,263 --> 00:18:31,433
from 11:00 p.m.
until 1:55 a.m.

00:18:31,433 --> 00:18:33,435
Home at the time
of the reverend's death.

00:18:33,435 --> 00:18:36,137
Yeah, but the murder weapon
was found at Cliff's place.

00:18:36,137 --> 00:18:39,474
Ballistics confirmed it,
so whoever killed the reverend

00:18:39,474 --> 00:18:41,176
had to have gone
to Cliff's afterwards.

00:18:41,176 --> 00:18:43,778
Used the gun to drive Cliff
out the window

00:18:43,778 --> 00:18:45,513
and then planted it.

00:18:45,513 --> 00:18:47,682
But why would somebody go
after the reverend and Cliff

00:18:47,682 --> 00:18:49,150
on the very same night?

00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:50,752
A minister and a sinner.

00:18:50,752 --> 00:18:53,121
And there might be more of
a connection than we thought.

00:18:53,121 --> 00:18:55,457
Russell's going through both
of the men's finances.

00:18:55,457 --> 00:18:57,492
So far, the reverend's
bank accounts

00:18:57,492 --> 00:19:01,162
are suspiciously fruitful
and multiplying.

00:19:01,162 --> 00:19:03,098
(people screaming on ride)

00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,577
STOKES:
That's pretty cool, huh?

00:19:15,577 --> 00:19:17,679
I like chalk better.

00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,414
Yeah, hey, Eli.

00:19:19,414 --> 00:19:23,418
I want to ask you
about somebody.

00:19:23,418 --> 00:19:25,587
Do you know this man,
Cliff?

00:19:25,587 --> 00:19:27,555
He comes over
to your house sometimes.

00:19:27,555 --> 00:19:29,524
All the time.

00:19:29,524 --> 00:19:30,792
I don't like him.

00:19:30,792 --> 00:19:33,762
No? Why's that?

00:19:33,762 --> 00:19:36,731
He yells; he's scary.

00:19:36,731 --> 00:19:39,467
He makes my mom get sad.

00:19:39,467 --> 00:19:41,569
That's when I hide
under my bed.

00:19:44,172 --> 00:19:45,640
OFFICER:
Right this way, Miss Brewster.

00:19:50,245 --> 00:19:53,615
Let me show you something else
this can do here.

00:19:58,353 --> 00:20:00,488
Chalk can't do that, huh?

00:20:03,124 --> 00:20:06,261
Last night, Mom promised me

00:20:06,261 --> 00:20:08,229
he won't come over anymore.

00:20:10,331 --> 00:20:11,633
Okay.

00:20:16,237 --> 00:20:17,672
Boy, you look just like
your daddy.

00:20:17,672 --> 00:20:19,541
You know that?

00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:20,809
My daddy was handsome, huh?

00:20:20,809 --> 00:20:23,478
Yeah, he was.

00:20:23,478 --> 00:20:25,280
He sure was.

00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,614
See, the problem
here in Vegas is,

00:20:26,614 --> 00:20:28,883
spare cash is quicker
to the crap table

00:20:28,883 --> 00:20:30,718
than the collection plate.

00:20:30,718 --> 00:20:33,354
So the reverend
needed an angle.

00:20:33,354 --> 00:20:34,789
Ripping off real estate

00:20:34,789 --> 00:20:36,558
probably seemed
like a good idea to him.

00:20:36,558 --> 00:20:39,127
Yeah, we checked
his finances,

00:20:39,127 --> 00:20:40,695
discovered the scam
he pulled,

00:20:40,695 --> 00:20:43,097
getting you to sign your house
over to the church.

00:20:43,097 --> 00:20:44,833
You're not the only one
he did this to.

00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:46,234
How'd he get you to sign?

00:20:46,234 --> 00:20:47,435
He get Cliff Paul

00:20:47,435 --> 00:20:49,404
to make you sign
on the dotted line?

00:20:49,404 --> 00:20:52,474
Because as soon
as the deal was done, that day,

00:20:52,474 --> 00:20:54,843
the revered broke off
Cliff Paul a grand.

00:20:54,843 --> 00:20:56,578
That house is mine.

00:20:56,578 --> 00:20:58,246
Except you gave it away, Tina.

00:20:58,246 --> 00:20:59,814
The bank told us
you called them last week.

00:20:59,814 --> 00:21:01,483
You were cussing them out.

00:21:01,483 --> 00:21:03,485
You were trying to get them
to change the deed back,

00:21:03,485 --> 00:21:04,886
but the deed was already done.

00:21:04,886 --> 00:21:06,855
That's why Reverend Rick
came over last night.

00:21:06,855 --> 00:21:08,423
I told him that
I was gonna let

00:21:08,423 --> 00:21:11,326
everybody in the church
know what he'd done.

00:21:11,326 --> 00:21:14,329
And he said that everything
was gonna be okay for me.

00:21:14,329 --> 00:21:15,697
Well, an hour later,

00:21:15,697 --> 00:21:19,267
someone made everything
not okay for him.

00:21:19,267 --> 00:21:20,802
We know that you had
a violent fight

00:21:20,802 --> 00:21:23,304
with Cliff Paul,
and you drew some blood.

00:21:26,107 --> 00:21:27,542
They kicked down my door.

00:21:28,877 --> 00:21:30,345
BRASS: Tina...
You steal my son,

00:21:30,345 --> 00:21:31,813
and now you're accusing me
of murder?

00:21:31,813 --> 00:21:33,815
We're just trying
to figure this out, okay?

00:21:33,815 --> 00:21:36,384
Well, let's start with--
I've never seen this flashlight.

00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,752
It was in Warrick's CSI kit.

00:21:37,752 --> 00:21:39,320
It would've been
in your possession.

00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,688
After the job killed him,

00:21:40,688 --> 00:21:44,425
I gave all of Warrick's
CSI junk away.

00:21:44,425 --> 00:21:46,327
Well, who'd you give it to?

00:21:46,327 --> 00:21:47,529
Some kid from the neighborhood

00:21:47,529 --> 00:21:49,130
that Warrick would help out.

00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:51,199
Well, is he still
in the neighborhood?

00:21:51,199 --> 00:21:52,667
Yeah.

00:21:52,667 --> 00:21:54,569
Where can we find him?

00:22:09,484 --> 00:22:10,852
(footsteps approaching)

00:22:14,122 --> 00:22:15,323
LVPD.

00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,595
Take your hood off
so I can see you.

00:22:23,131 --> 00:22:25,500
I thought you released
this crime scene.

00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,435
We did.

00:22:28,836 --> 00:22:31,539
Are you James Newman?

00:22:31,539 --> 00:22:34,442
I heard you were a friend
of Warrick Brown's.

00:22:34,442 --> 00:22:36,477
Did he teach you
about crime scenes?

00:22:36,477 --> 00:22:38,646
Warrick taught me
everything.

00:22:38,646 --> 00:22:39,847
Looked out for me.

00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:45,787
I saw you near
Tina's place earlier.

00:22:45,787 --> 00:22:48,756
She says she sees you
there a lot.

00:22:48,756 --> 00:22:50,258
What are you doing
over there?

00:22:50,258 --> 00:22:52,560
They need someone
to look out for them.

00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,129
What do you know
about Reverend Rick

00:22:55,129 --> 00:22:56,664
and Cliff Paul?

00:22:56,664 --> 00:22:58,733
Warrick would've
wanted them gone.

00:23:04,606 --> 00:23:07,141
NEWMAN (over speakers): You need
to send an officer out here!

00:23:07,141 --> 00:23:08,676
Tina Brewster's house!

00:23:08,676 --> 00:23:10,812
There's a guy in there with her
and her son--Cliff Paul!

00:23:10,812 --> 00:23:13,214
And I can hear him yelling!
Hurry!

00:23:13,214 --> 00:23:15,350
We pulled the LVPD's
phone logs.

00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:18,119
You made four calls
last week,

00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:20,488
but the police
never did respond?

00:23:20,488 --> 00:23:22,457
So you took drastic action
on your own.

00:23:22,457 --> 00:23:24,559
You went to Cliff's house
and duked it out with him.

00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:28,162
And we found blood,
your DNA, on his floor.

00:23:28,162 --> 00:23:29,497
That was three days ago.

00:23:31,666 --> 00:23:33,201
Stay away from Tina and Eli.

00:23:33,201 --> 00:23:35,637
And if I don't, big man?

00:23:40,642 --> 00:23:42,610
He hit me.
I defended myself.

00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:43,778
That was all I did.

00:23:49,817 --> 00:23:52,520
My nephew is <i>not</i>
a criminal.

00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,155
How long has James
lived with you?

00:23:54,155 --> 00:23:57,191
Since my sister died,
seven years ago.

00:23:57,191 --> 00:23:59,394
Single mother,
he didn't have anyone else.

00:23:59,394 --> 00:24:00,795
Have you ever known him
to be violent?

00:24:00,795 --> 00:24:02,230
Never!

00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:04,365
And the reverend?

00:24:04,365 --> 00:24:06,601
James volunteers
at the church;

00:24:06,601 --> 00:24:08,369
he works closely
with Reverend Rick.

00:24:08,369 --> 00:24:10,204
Why would anyone think
he would want

00:24:10,204 --> 00:24:11,606
to hurt a good man
like that?

00:24:11,606 --> 00:24:14,809
The reverend may have had
some indiscretions

00:24:14,809 --> 00:24:17,145
that James was privy to.

00:24:21,883 --> 00:24:24,419
Ms. Newman,

00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:27,221
is there something
that you...?

00:24:27,221 --> 00:24:28,589
James's mother...

00:24:30,825 --> 00:24:32,694
Her mind wasn't right.

00:24:32,694 --> 00:24:35,229
"Vivid imagination,"
we called it at first.

00:24:35,229 --> 00:24:37,398
Only, the things
she was seeing and hearing,

00:24:37,398 --> 00:24:39,167
it wasn't imaginary to her.

00:24:40,735 --> 00:24:43,471
Then it was too much.

00:24:43,471 --> 00:24:45,306
She killed herself.

00:24:47,775 --> 00:24:52,847
James has always been
a great kid.

00:24:52,847 --> 00:24:56,517
Straight A's. Kind.

00:24:56,517 --> 00:24:57,819
Same way his mother was.

00:24:59,353 --> 00:25:00,555
Until...

00:25:00,555 --> 00:25:02,156
Until she changed.

00:25:05,259 --> 00:25:07,261
Your aunt let us
into your room,

00:25:07,261 --> 00:25:09,197
where we found
some of your notes here.

00:25:09,197 --> 00:25:14,669
".22 caliber smaller gun, $100,
.45 caliber, $150.

00:25:14,669 --> 00:25:19,373
Guy on the corner of Washington
and D has other pieces."

00:25:19,373 --> 00:25:20,675
And you went with a .45.

00:25:20,675 --> 00:25:22,143
I didn't buy a gun.

00:25:22,143 --> 00:25:23,578
I wanted one
just to scare

00:25:23,578 --> 00:25:25,780
these guys away
from Tina and Eli.

00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:28,182
The guy on the corner,
he wouldn't even sell it to me.

00:25:28,182 --> 00:25:30,485
The guy on the corner, what's
he, a gun-control advocate?

00:25:30,485 --> 00:25:32,153
'Cause you bought a gun,

00:25:32,153 --> 00:25:33,788
shot the reverend,
then you went to Cliff's.

00:25:33,788 --> 00:25:36,390
I wanted them dead!

00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:38,459
Warrick would've
wanted them dead.

00:25:38,459 --> 00:25:41,429
The way those two
treated his family?

00:25:41,429 --> 00:25:42,830
I kept thinking about it.

00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:44,332
But I didn't do it!

00:25:44,332 --> 00:25:46,100
So, what, you just

00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:49,170
wished it out there
in the universe, and behold,

00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:50,404
two people end up dead?

00:25:50,404 --> 00:25:51,572
Yes.

00:25:53,641 --> 00:25:55,476
It's happened to me before.

00:25:55,476 --> 00:25:59,313
And what do you mean by that?
Ben Drayton.

00:25:59,313 --> 00:26:02,884
Guy down my street,
year older than me.

00:26:02,884 --> 00:26:05,153
Used to knock me around,
take my stuff.

00:26:05,153 --> 00:26:07,421
One day, around a year ago,
maybe,

00:26:07,421 --> 00:26:09,457
I had these new sneakers.

00:26:09,457 --> 00:26:11,392
After school,
Ben Drayton jumped me.

00:26:11,392 --> 00:26:14,328
and ripped them
right off my feet.

00:26:14,328 --> 00:26:16,264
I walked home in my socks.

00:26:16,264 --> 00:26:19,267
The next morning,
I opened my front door

00:26:19,267 --> 00:26:21,102
and my sneakers were
right there.

00:26:22,703 --> 00:26:26,541
Nobody I know has ever
seen Ben Drayton again.

00:26:26,541 --> 00:26:29,310
Warrick always said
he'd look out for me.

00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:31,212
And even though he's gone,

00:26:31,212 --> 00:26:33,648
I still think he's somehow
watching over me and his family.

00:26:36,217 --> 00:26:38,886
They were up on a shelf
in James's room,

00:26:38,886 --> 00:26:40,788
sitting there
like trophies.

00:26:40,788 --> 00:26:43,825
Well, I guess if your mystical
guardian angel returns them,

00:26:43,825 --> 00:26:46,160
you're not just gonna
wear them around, right?

00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,662
RUSSELL:
Check this out.

00:26:47,662 --> 00:26:51,199
"Bully Ben" was reported missing
by his family a year ago.

00:26:51,199 --> 00:26:53,267
That's consistent
with James's story.

00:26:53,267 --> 00:26:56,270
He's working a night shift at
a burger joint, never came home.

00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:58,406
18 years old,
behavior issues,

00:26:58,406 --> 00:26:59,841
cops just figured
it was a runaway.

00:26:59,841 --> 00:27:01,542
Well, I don't think
it was that simple.

00:27:01,542 --> 00:27:03,377
Look at this.

00:27:05,413 --> 00:27:07,782
RUSSELL: Blood spatter.
High-velocity.

00:27:07,782 --> 00:27:10,284
Not talking a nosebleed
or a fistfight.

00:27:10,284 --> 00:27:11,686
Gunshot.

00:27:11,686 --> 00:27:13,721
Okay, there is
a DNA sample

00:27:13,721 --> 00:27:16,824
of Ben Drayton's
in the missing persons database.

00:27:16,824 --> 00:27:18,292
Let's get a comparison.

00:28:03,337 --> 00:28:05,439
Surveillance footage
from Ben Drayton's final shift

00:28:05,439 --> 00:28:06,874
at the burger joint.

00:28:06,874 --> 00:28:08,643
He's the last guy there,
so he's closing up.

00:28:08,643 --> 00:28:10,311
Look at that.

00:28:10,311 --> 00:28:12,713
He's wearing the shoes
he took from James.

00:28:12,713 --> 00:28:16,217
Now a shadowy someone
catches his attention.

00:28:21,322 --> 00:28:23,224
Is that it?

00:28:23,224 --> 00:28:24,458
Gone.

00:28:24,458 --> 00:28:25,660
Sara, they're telling me that

00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:28,496
I might not get Eli
back for months.

00:28:28,496 --> 00:28:29,697
You need to help me.

00:28:29,697 --> 00:28:31,866
Tell them you know me.

00:28:31,866 --> 00:28:33,567
Yeah, I'm sorry, Tina.
Really, I am.

00:28:33,567 --> 00:28:35,603
But there's nothing
I can do.

00:28:38,673 --> 00:28:40,675
Oh, so this is how this works?

00:28:40,675 --> 00:28:42,543
CSIs just show up,

00:28:42,543 --> 00:28:44,845
and if I don't let them
into my house,

00:28:44,845 --> 00:28:47,248
then my life just gets
ripped away from me?

00:28:47,248 --> 00:28:48,616
You didn't let us in
four years ago.

00:28:48,616 --> 00:28:49,817
We wanted to
be there for you,

00:28:49,817 --> 00:28:51,152
and then none of this...

00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,789
I have to go
back to work now.

00:28:54,789 --> 00:28:56,724
If I would've
let you in, I...

00:28:56,724 --> 00:28:58,492
I wouldn't be alive.

00:29:00,361 --> 00:29:02,596
After Warrick died,

00:29:02,596 --> 00:29:04,532
Eli was the only thing

00:29:04,532 --> 00:29:06,701
that kept me
from ending things.

00:29:06,701 --> 00:29:09,170
I told myself that
he needed me.

00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:11,238
He was the reason to...
to get up,

00:29:11,238 --> 00:29:13,541
to go through
the motions, and...

00:29:13,541 --> 00:29:15,142
if I would've
let you all in...

00:29:16,877 --> 00:29:19,680
...Eli wouldn't have
needed me,

00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,216
and I wasn't gonna
let that happen.

00:29:24,719 --> 00:29:28,356
Eli's always going
to need you.

00:29:28,356 --> 00:29:29,824
And he'll be back, Tina.

00:29:32,226 --> 00:29:35,529
But you need to find
your way back first.

00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:48,342
The journey of the wandering
gym shoes continues.

00:29:48,342 --> 00:29:50,678
BRODY:
We analyzed trace on
the soles--think we've figured

00:29:50,678 --> 00:29:52,546
where they may have
taken their last steps.

00:29:52,546 --> 00:29:53,781
Trace of rust

00:29:53,781 --> 00:29:56,784
and auto paint chips
in oil-saturated soil.

00:29:56,784 --> 00:29:58,652
Auto junkyard, no?

00:29:58,652 --> 00:30:00,354
Why would Ben Drayton
have gone there?

00:30:00,354 --> 00:30:01,622
I can think of more reasons

00:30:01,622 --> 00:30:03,457
why someone would've
taken him there.

00:30:03,457 --> 00:30:04,825
Junkyard's
a secluded place.

00:30:04,825 --> 00:30:06,427
Late at night.

00:30:08,462 --> 00:30:09,630
(gunshot)

00:30:12,566 --> 00:30:15,436
I found a junkyard
a mile away

00:30:15,436 --> 00:30:16,837
from Ben's burger joint.

00:30:16,837 --> 00:30:19,373
I realize it's
a year-old crime scene,

00:30:19,373 --> 00:30:21,242
so fat chance
of evidence, but...

00:30:21,242 --> 00:30:23,110
He may still be there.

00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:24,311
Lots of land.

00:30:24,311 --> 00:30:25,513
Crammed with wreckage.

00:30:25,513 --> 00:30:27,548
Why take the body
anywhere else?

00:30:31,452 --> 00:30:33,554
STOKES:
All right, thanks.

00:30:37,491 --> 00:30:39,593
You know, even if there
is a body out here,

00:30:39,593 --> 00:30:42,229
half a million pounds of steel
could be on top of it.

00:30:42,229 --> 00:30:43,864
FINLAY:
Yeah.

00:30:43,864 --> 00:30:45,332
(beeping)

00:30:45,332 --> 00:30:46,600
What is that?

00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,235
It is a ten-dollar
long shot.

00:30:48,235 --> 00:30:51,105
(chuckles) I noticed
on the surveillance video

00:30:51,105 --> 00:30:54,241
that Ben Drayton had
a "find-my-key" fob

00:30:54,241 --> 00:30:55,709
on his keychain.

00:30:55,709 --> 00:30:58,712
You know, lose your keys,
click this button,

00:30:58,712 --> 00:31:01,415
keychain beeps,
find your keys.
Yeah, yeah.

00:31:01,415 --> 00:31:03,451
Well, it's
worth a shot.

00:31:03,451 --> 00:31:04,819
Yep.

00:31:09,657 --> 00:31:10,791
(beeping)

00:31:17,331 --> 00:31:19,200
(beeping)

00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,374
(beeping)

00:31:31,579 --> 00:31:33,581
Well...

00:31:33,581 --> 00:31:35,249
short of clearing the yard

00:31:35,249 --> 00:31:37,885
and bringing in
ground-penetrating radar,

00:31:37,885 --> 00:31:40,321
there's nothing
to indicate a burial.

00:31:40,321 --> 00:31:43,491
There's no signs
of a soil disturbance anywhere.

00:31:43,491 --> 00:31:46,393
Yeah, no slabs of
suspiciously-poured concrete.

00:31:46,393 --> 00:31:49,430
(beep pinging)
No bones unearthed
by helpful dogs.

00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:51,732
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What?

00:31:51,732 --> 00:31:53,134
Hit that thing again.

00:31:53,134 --> 00:31:54,802
(beep pinging)

00:31:54,802 --> 00:31:56,737
(beep, answered by pinging)

00:31:56,737 --> 00:31:59,173
(beep,
answered by pinging)

00:32:00,541 --> 00:32:01,809
No.

00:32:04,745 --> 00:32:07,681
(beep pinging, echoing)

00:32:11,252 --> 00:32:14,188
(shovel digging)

00:32:17,625 --> 00:32:18,826
(sighs)

00:32:22,096 --> 00:32:23,697
(Finlay groans, Stokes sighs)

00:32:23,697 --> 00:32:25,733
STOKES:
Yeah, that's Ben Drayton.

00:32:28,602 --> 00:32:30,137
Died with his boots off.

00:32:31,872 --> 00:32:33,641
All right, let's get him
out here, boys.

00:32:33,641 --> 00:32:36,110
Jimmy,
grab the head.

00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:37,878
Okay, on three.

00:32:37,878 --> 00:32:39,580
ALL:
One, two,

00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:40,714
(grunting):
three.

00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:58,299
Bullet's in there.

00:32:58,299 --> 00:32:59,800
Okay. I'll tell Doc.

00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,535
Killer could've pulled
this trunk liner

00:33:01,535 --> 00:33:03,304
from any one of these wrecks.

00:33:03,304 --> 00:33:05,773
Bundled the body
to contain the blood

00:33:05,773 --> 00:33:07,341
before digging the grave.

00:33:07,341 --> 00:33:08,709
PHILLIPS:
That's not all he bundled.

00:33:08,709 --> 00:33:10,444
Take a look at this hair.

00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:17,818
Near the victim's feet.

00:33:20,554 --> 00:33:22,590
<i>Could be from the assailant.</i>

00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:25,559
James Newman thinks that the
universe is granting him wishes.

00:33:29,263 --> 00:33:31,665
Let's hope that
he kept it to three.

00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:39,311
ANDREWS:
<i>Russell.</i>

00:33:39,311 --> 00:33:41,112
Yeah.
Uh, the hair that was
buried with the bully?

00:33:41,112 --> 00:33:43,915
I ran the DNA profile
against James Newman.

00:33:43,915 --> 00:33:46,517
It's not his hair,
but it is a new lead.

00:33:46,517 --> 00:33:49,153
Hair shares alleles
with James, so the killer...

00:33:49,153 --> 00:33:50,888
...has to be a male
relative of his--

00:33:50,888 --> 00:33:52,590
father, brother, son.

00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:54,458
James is an only child.

00:33:54,458 --> 00:33:55,860
No kids of his own.

00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,495
Dad in the picture?

00:33:57,495 --> 00:33:58,729
Certainly is now.

00:34:00,798 --> 00:34:02,400
Hey.

00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,468
You, uh, balancing
your checkbook?

00:34:04,468 --> 00:34:06,404
No, I'm just
following the money--

00:34:06,404 --> 00:34:07,838
not mine, by the way.

00:34:07,838 --> 00:34:09,607
I spoke with James's aunt.

00:34:09,607 --> 00:34:12,176
She said that nobody knows
who James' father is--

00:34:12,176 --> 00:34:13,911
Mom would never say.

00:34:13,911 --> 00:34:16,948
But I figured, guy's killing
to protect his son--

00:34:16,948 --> 00:34:19,483
maybe he'd help out
in other ways.

00:34:19,483 --> 00:34:21,485
Money.
Aunt Jo said

00:34:21,485 --> 00:34:24,055
that the only financial help
that she's gotten has been

00:34:24,055 --> 00:34:25,790
checks from the mother's
life insurance.

00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:27,491
But she killed
herself,

00:34:27,491 --> 00:34:28,693
so there should be no payment.

00:34:28,693 --> 00:34:30,461
Exactly why I asked her

00:34:30,461 --> 00:34:33,030
for the info off of the most
recent check she received.

00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:35,066
I was just
entering it now.

00:34:38,669 --> 00:34:40,404
The checks came
from a private account...

00:34:42,106 --> 00:34:44,809
...opened by Warrick Brown.

00:34:44,809 --> 00:34:47,044
Warrick opened the account
ten years ago.

00:34:47,044 --> 00:34:50,147
And it has a balance of $50,000.

00:34:50,147 --> 00:34:52,850
Warrick actually have
that much extra cash?

00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:55,052
I wouldn't have thought so,
but even weirder--

00:34:55,052 --> 00:34:57,054
the deposits kept getting made
into the account

00:34:57,054 --> 00:34:59,690
after Warrick's death.

00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:01,759
Banking from beyond.

00:35:01,759 --> 00:35:03,194
(phone buzzes)

00:35:03,194 --> 00:35:04,829
(both sigh)

00:35:07,598 --> 00:35:09,433
Aaron Voss has been shot.

00:35:09,433 --> 00:35:12,069
That's the kingpin
from Warrick's neighborhood.

00:35:12,069 --> 00:35:14,939
Well, we know the killer is
all about protecting James,

00:35:14,939 --> 00:35:17,041
you know, making the world
safe for him.

00:35:17,041 --> 00:35:19,143
If Aaron Voss was making
that neighborhood

00:35:19,143 --> 00:35:20,678
a dangerous place...

00:35:20,678 --> 00:35:22,480
Guardian Angel is going
to make it dangerous

00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,781
for Aaron Voss.

00:35:28,052 --> 00:35:30,454
Kingpin Voss's vehicle?

00:35:30,454 --> 00:35:32,456
Just got back from the scene.

00:35:32,456 --> 00:35:33,991
Witnesses said
a silver Escalade

00:35:33,991 --> 00:35:35,426
just pulled up and popped him.

00:35:36,494 --> 00:35:37,795
(gunshot, Voss yells)

00:35:37,795 --> 00:35:39,563
Rushed to Desert Palm, stable.

00:35:39,563 --> 00:35:40,998
Same witnesses
gave us

00:35:40,998 --> 00:35:43,100
a partial plate
on the shooter's vehicle.

00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,136
Willing to help when it's
the boss who's been shot.

00:35:45,136 --> 00:35:47,038
Patrol is hunting down
the Escalade right now.

00:35:47,038 --> 00:35:50,474
Russell...yeah,
I tracked money wires

00:35:50,474 --> 00:35:51,776
into the Warrick account

00:35:51,776 --> 00:35:53,744
that was helping
to support James Newman.

00:35:53,744 --> 00:35:55,813
Funds came
from a Nevada corp.

00:35:55,813 --> 00:35:57,481
XL Industries.

00:35:57,481 --> 00:35:59,717
They own a number of
properties around Vegas--

00:35:59,717 --> 00:36:01,686
commercial buildings,
apartments,

00:36:01,686 --> 00:36:05,056
and the junkyard where
Ben Drayton's body was buried.

00:36:05,056 --> 00:36:07,758
So whoever's
behind XL Industries

00:36:07,758 --> 00:36:10,928
killed and buried Ben Drayton
on his property,

00:36:10,928 --> 00:36:12,730
and has been giving money
to support James.

00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:13,964
Who is it?

00:36:13,964 --> 00:36:15,800
(phone chimes)
Oh, hold on a sec.

00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,535
Yeah, Finn.

00:36:17,535 --> 00:36:19,537
FINLAY: Officers caught up
with Voss's shooter.

00:36:19,537 --> 00:36:20,971
They just brought him in.
And?

00:36:20,971 --> 00:36:22,940
Definitely not
our Guardian Angel.

00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:25,576
He's a 19-year-old banger
from another hood

00:36:25,576 --> 00:36:27,411
who was, uh,
making a power grab.

00:36:27,411 --> 00:36:30,514
Sounds like the same guy who
took a shot at Voss last week.

00:36:30,514 --> 00:36:31,882
We still got our killer
out there.

00:36:31,882 --> 00:36:34,151
Thank you.

00:36:34,151 --> 00:36:36,654
Russell...

00:36:36,654 --> 00:36:39,657
...there's only one name
associated with XL Industries.

00:36:45,062 --> 00:36:47,765
I'll get Henry to run DNA,
confirm paternity.

00:36:50,434 --> 00:36:52,403
Hey.

00:36:52,403 --> 00:36:54,572
Hey.

00:36:54,572 --> 00:36:55,973
Voss was shot
in the front seat,

00:36:55,973 --> 00:36:57,641
not the, um, trunk.

00:36:57,641 --> 00:37:00,411
Car is evidence
for whatever case we want.

00:37:04,115 --> 00:37:05,850
This is a trunk liner

00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:08,619
that was wrapped
around Ben Drayton's body.

00:37:08,619 --> 00:37:10,855
Very d-distinct
wear patterns.

00:37:16,594 --> 00:37:19,130
Aaron Voss killed
and dumped Ben Drayton.

00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:21,999
Wouldn't be the first time
a father got

00:37:21,999 --> 00:37:24,135
hands-on
with his son's bully.

00:37:24,135 --> 00:37:25,770
Voss is James' father?

00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:27,538
Yeah, how about that, huh?

00:37:27,538 --> 00:37:30,107
Did you find any trace
on the passenger side?

00:37:30,107 --> 00:37:32,476
Uh, no, I was still working
on the driver's side.

00:37:32,476 --> 00:37:33,944
'Cause the reverend
still had

00:37:33,944 --> 00:37:36,747
the chalk on his shoe
from Tina's house.

00:37:36,747 --> 00:37:38,582
Hadn't walked it off yet,

00:37:38,582 --> 00:37:41,952
which means he had to have
gotten a ride to the cemetery.

00:37:41,952 --> 00:37:44,421
The car
was freshly vacuumed.

00:37:53,764 --> 00:37:56,100
Well, look at that.

00:37:57,968 --> 00:38:00,704
Mark of the reverend.

00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:03,073
Hard to believe that just
fell out of his pocket

00:38:03,073 --> 00:38:04,542
into that crevice.

00:38:04,542 --> 00:38:06,443
More likely,
the reverend knew

00:38:06,443 --> 00:38:08,979
that when the local crime boss
gets you in his car...

00:38:10,781 --> 00:38:12,850
<i>...You may not be seen again.</i>

00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:18,823
<i>Probably just stuffed</i>
<i>the handkerchief</i>

00:38:18,823 --> 00:38:21,525
<i>in the cushion here</i>
<i>as a Hail Mary bread crumb</i>

00:38:21,525 --> 00:38:24,428
<i>to get Voss busted.</i>

00:38:24,428 --> 00:38:26,664
(grunts)
<i>For making him kneel</i>
<i>one last time.</i>

00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:34,171
Why Warrick's grave?

00:38:34,171 --> 00:38:36,841
Maybe as a warning
to anyone else

00:38:36,841 --> 00:38:38,943
who might want
to mess with Tina.

00:38:38,943 --> 00:38:41,745
Stay away from
Warrick Brown's family.

00:38:41,745 --> 00:38:43,914
Warning came too late
for Cliff Paul.

00:38:43,914 --> 00:38:45,416
(banging on door)

00:38:47,551 --> 00:38:48,853
No, no-no...

00:38:57,127 --> 00:38:58,829
Homie, I am titanium.

00:38:58,829 --> 00:39:00,431
Lead can't scratch me.

00:39:00,431 --> 00:39:03,767
Car wash, cocktail,
I'm straight.

00:39:03,767 --> 00:39:06,503
Yeah, we'll talk
how to handle that.

00:39:06,503 --> 00:39:09,607
All's forgiven
and forgotten, Officer.

00:39:09,607 --> 00:39:12,042
No need to waste
community resources.

00:39:12,042 --> 00:39:13,944
RUSSELL:
Well, that's very
generous of you.

00:39:13,944 --> 00:39:16,180
So willing to look past
the misdeeds of others,

00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,781
even after you take a bullet.

00:39:17,781 --> 00:39:19,116
Actually, I want
to talk to you about

00:39:19,116 --> 00:39:20,818
your misdeeds.

00:39:20,818 --> 00:39:22,486
I don't know what
you're talking about.

00:39:22,486 --> 00:39:24,054
We know that
you're James's father.

00:39:24,054 --> 00:39:25,923
DNA proved that.

00:39:25,923 --> 00:39:28,959
We also know that you've been
providing for him, financially,

00:39:28,959 --> 00:39:30,527
in Warrick Brown's name.

00:39:30,527 --> 00:39:32,029
You remember Warrick, right?

00:39:32,029 --> 00:39:35,399
The guy who was the real man
in your son's life,

00:39:35,399 --> 00:39:38,669
not just
some scumbag crook.

00:39:38,669 --> 00:39:41,071
Warrick wanted
to play the hero,

00:39:41,071 --> 00:39:44,441
so I let him...
on my dollar.

00:39:44,441 --> 00:39:45,776
So what?

00:39:45,776 --> 00:39:47,511
So what is that's
not the only way

00:39:47,511 --> 00:39:49,413
you've been providing
for your son.

00:39:49,413 --> 00:39:50,848
You keep your eyes on him,

00:39:50,848 --> 00:39:53,017
you know when he's getting
into trouble,

00:39:53,017 --> 00:39:55,586
like when the bully
gave him that hard time.

00:39:55,586 --> 00:39:56,887
You remember that?

00:39:56,887 --> 00:40:00,090
Or when James was trying
to buy a gun

00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:03,727
from one of your corner guys
to protect Warrick's family--

00:40:03,727 --> 00:40:05,663
now, you saw that go down
and you decided,

00:40:05,663 --> 00:40:07,531
"Well, I'm gonna take care
of that myself

00:40:07,531 --> 00:40:09,767
so my son doesn't have to."

00:40:09,767 --> 00:40:12,836
Bottom line--
you killed three people.

00:40:12,836 --> 00:40:16,173
I got to be honest
with you...

00:40:16,173 --> 00:40:17,641
That doesn't sound
like me.

00:40:17,641 --> 00:40:19,576
No?
Looking out
for a kid...

00:40:21,145 --> 00:40:24,915
...Protecting him so
he can grow up, get out,

00:40:24,915 --> 00:40:26,183
become something.

00:40:28,786 --> 00:40:30,821
Why would a scumbag crook
like Aaron Voss

00:40:30,821 --> 00:40:33,190
do something like that?

00:40:38,562 --> 00:40:40,631
Aaron Voss,
you're under arrest

00:40:40,631 --> 00:40:42,099
for the murders
of Ben Drayton,

00:40:42,099 --> 00:40:44,501
Rick Renken,
and Cliff Paul.

00:40:44,501 --> 00:40:45,970
You have the right
to remain silent...

00:40:47,571 --> 00:40:48,939
(sighs)

00:40:50,607 --> 00:40:52,409
Tell you the truth, man...

00:40:52,409 --> 00:40:54,645
I always liked believing
Warrick was my dad.

00:40:54,645 --> 00:40:55,946
Really?

00:40:55,946 --> 00:40:57,948
Yeah.

00:40:57,948 --> 00:41:00,517
Being the son of a guy
like Aaron Voss--

00:41:00,517 --> 00:41:02,052
I don't know what
to do with that.

00:41:02,052 --> 00:41:03,921
No, you don't have
to do anything with it.

00:41:03,921 --> 00:41:06,523
I mean, Voss doesn't have
to mean anything to you.

00:41:06,523 --> 00:41:09,126
It's not like he ever offered
himself as a father.

00:41:09,126 --> 00:41:10,761
Besides, you don't
really need his kind

00:41:10,761 --> 00:41:12,463
of looking out
for you, anyway.

00:41:12,463 --> 00:41:13,664
You know what I mean?

00:41:13,664 --> 00:41:15,432
So is he going away?

00:41:15,432 --> 00:41:16,867
Yeah, he is.

00:41:16,867 --> 00:41:18,502
And by playing
guardian angel to you,

00:41:18,502 --> 00:41:20,637
he may have just saved
that whole neighborhood.

00:41:20,637 --> 00:41:21,872
Yeah, from him.

00:41:21,872 --> 00:41:23,941
Exactly.

00:41:23,941 --> 00:41:25,542
Warrick would be happy.

00:41:25,542 --> 00:41:26,977
Yeah, I think so.

00:41:28,812 --> 00:41:31,915
You know, I still hear him
talking to me sometimes,

00:41:31,915 --> 00:41:33,851
you know, when things
are going wrong and...

00:41:33,851 --> 00:41:35,152
I know it sounds crazy.

00:41:35,152 --> 00:41:39,089
No, it doesn't sound crazy;
not to me.

00:41:39,089 --> 00:41:42,826
Warrick...walks
beside me every day.

00:41:42,826 --> 00:41:44,695
He's the source
of a lot of my strength.

00:41:46,697 --> 00:41:48,098
He's a good friend
to have, man.

00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,635
Don't ever let him go.

00:41:54,438 --> 00:41:56,640
The church is cleaning out
the reverend's bad deals.

00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,575
The house is going
to stay yours.

00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:02,579
I... I really
appreciate that,

00:42:02,579 --> 00:42:05,783
and, Sara, about what you said
about finding my way back,

00:42:05,783 --> 00:42:10,721
I'm in--meetings, counseling,
whatever it takes.

00:42:10,721 --> 00:42:12,656
Um, I spoke with CPS.

00:42:12,656 --> 00:42:14,625
Um, Eli is going to stay
with a foster family

00:42:14,625 --> 00:42:16,527
for a couple of days,

00:42:16,527 --> 00:42:19,730
but then they're gonna talk
to you about what comes next.

00:42:24,101 --> 00:42:26,470
You know, you, uh...

00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:29,907
you could have called me
with this, Sara.

00:42:29,907 --> 00:42:33,544
I gave you my number
and I--I promise...

00:42:33,544 --> 00:42:34,912
I'll answer now.

00:42:34,912 --> 00:42:36,880
Okay.

00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:40,584
But, um, I wanted you
to have a minute.

00:42:40,584 --> 00:42:41,885
What?
