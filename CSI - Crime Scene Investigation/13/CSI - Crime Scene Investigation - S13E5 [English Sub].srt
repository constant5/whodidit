00:00:02,975 --> 00:00:05,176
(wolf howls)

00:00:05,176 --> 00:00:06,911
(eerie moaning)

00:00:06,911 --> 00:00:07,369
(evil laughter)

00:00:07,369 --> 00:00:10,669
MAN:
What's up, man?

00:00:10,669 --> 00:00:13,405
Shut your mouth and act like
you got some sense, girl!

00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:16,525
Are you sure you have
the right address?

00:00:16,525 --> 00:00:18,660
It's 1027 Washington Street.

00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:19,928
(cackling in distance)

00:00:19,928 --> 00:00:22,130
I don't even
see any numbers.

00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,433
Well, it's got
to be just...

00:00:24,433 --> 00:00:25,801
up there.

00:00:25,801 --> 00:00:27,135
You better shut

00:00:27,135 --> 00:00:28,470
your mouth!

00:00:32,774 --> 00:00:33,775
That guy

00:00:33,775 --> 00:00:35,377
has a gun.
It's...

00:00:35,377 --> 00:00:36,879
probably just part
of his costume.

00:00:38,113 --> 00:00:39,348
MAN:
Yo.

00:00:39,348 --> 00:00:40,949
Cheerleader.
Yeah, you.

00:00:40,949 --> 00:00:41,950
Okay.

00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:43,118
Forget the party.

00:00:43,118 --> 00:00:44,820
Let's get a cab
and go home.

00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,522
MAN:
Want to party with us?

00:00:46,522 --> 00:00:48,824
(man laughing)

00:00:48,824 --> 00:00:50,959
(gasps)
What is that?

00:00:50,959 --> 00:00:53,896
(growling, slobbering)

00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:59,768
(snarling)

00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:00,769
(barking)

00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:01,904
(screaming)

00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:06,575
(barking)

00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:08,911
MAN:
Come!

00:01:08,911 --> 00:01:10,345
STOKES:
Hey.

00:01:10,345 --> 00:01:12,080
What's going on?
Well, the dog's

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,116
freaking out.
Won't let us near the body.

00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:16,018
It's like he's...
guarding his kill.

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,654
STOKES:
Who called it in?

00:01:18,654 --> 00:01:19,955
BRASS: Tinker Bell
and the cheerleader.

00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:21,657
They got lost on the way
to a party. At first,

00:01:21,657 --> 00:01:23,692
they thought
the body was a fake.

00:01:23,692 --> 00:01:24,760
Happy Halloween.

00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,762
STOKES:
Looks like the dog went

00:01:26,762 --> 00:01:28,096
for his throat.
Yeah.

00:01:28,096 --> 00:01:30,365
BRASS:
Animal instinct.

00:01:30,365 --> 00:01:31,767
Well, his throat is

00:01:31,767 --> 00:01:33,535
completely ripped open.

00:01:33,535 --> 00:01:34,770
Must've bled out.

00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:35,971
STOKES:
Any I.D.?

00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:37,105
Yeah.

00:01:37,105 --> 00:01:39,107
Smith &amp; Wesson.

00:01:39,107 --> 00:01:40,442
Okay, well...

00:01:42,878 --> 00:01:44,813
Gun hasn't been fired.

00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:45,814
And a wallet.

00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,416
(dog barking)

00:01:48,517 --> 00:01:49,952
STOKES:
He's a cop.

00:01:49,952 --> 00:01:51,954
K-9 Unit,

00:01:51,954 --> 00:01:53,889
Officer Mike Nelson.
So you think

00:01:53,889 --> 00:01:55,390
that's his dog?

00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:56,825
So much for man's best friend.

00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,493
Found something else.

00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:00,429
Want to give me
some light there?
Okay.

00:02:03,432 --> 00:02:05,067
Oh, man.

00:02:05,067 --> 00:02:08,036
Well, it looks like
methamphetamines, Jim.

00:02:08,036 --> 00:02:10,572
So we got a cop out of uniform
in a skanky part of town

00:02:10,572 --> 00:02:11,607
with a bag of ice.

00:02:11,607 --> 00:02:13,475
Something stinks here

00:02:13,475 --> 00:02:15,143
and I don't think it's the dog.

STOKES:
CSI Russell,

00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,558
Sergeant Varanski,

00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:05,894
chief trainer
with the K-9 unit.

00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,129
Sorry about Officer Nelson.

00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:09,731
Is that dog

00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:11,433
always that aggressive?

00:03:11,433 --> 00:03:12,901
Sam? No.

00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:15,103
He and Mike were partners
for eight years.

00:03:15,103 --> 00:03:16,571
Best team in the department.

00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,373
STOKES: Officer Nelson
was out of uniform.

00:03:18,373 --> 00:03:19,541
Was he working undercover?

00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:20,609
No.

00:03:20,609 --> 00:03:21,877
He was off duty last night.

00:03:21,877 --> 00:03:23,745
If he was off duty,
what was he doing

00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,914
in the alphabets
with a bag full of meth?

00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,983
Mike was a good cop.

00:03:27,983 --> 00:03:29,718
They both were.

00:03:29,718 --> 00:03:31,787
These dogs are trained
to attack, am I right?

00:03:31,787 --> 00:03:33,488
They only bite to hold a suspect

00:03:33,488 --> 00:03:35,390
or to defend themselves.
We're talking about

00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:37,526
more than just a bite here,
Sergeant.

00:03:37,526 --> 00:03:39,461
Nelson's throat was ripped open.

00:03:39,461 --> 00:03:41,863
Can you think of
anything that would set

00:03:41,863 --> 00:03:43,665
that dog off?

00:03:43,665 --> 00:03:45,367
He could be sick.

00:03:45,367 --> 00:03:47,369
That would make
any dog lash out.

00:03:47,369 --> 00:03:49,371
And he could've gotten
into Nelson's stash. I mean,

00:03:49,371 --> 00:03:50,505
look at him.
(growls)

00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:53,875
I'll take him into custody,

00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:55,510
get him checked out by the vet.
No, no.

00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,345
No, we have
to process him first.

00:03:57,345 --> 00:03:58,513
He's got evidence
all over him.

00:03:58,513 --> 00:03:59,848
STOKES:
Yeah, when we're done

00:03:59,848 --> 00:04:01,483
I'll make sure
he gets to you, okay?

00:04:01,483 --> 00:04:02,718
Thank you very much.

00:04:02,718 --> 00:04:04,052
Appreciate that.

00:04:04,052 --> 00:04:05,754
(barking, snarling)

00:04:28,777 --> 00:04:30,412
STOKES:
Hey.

00:04:30,412 --> 00:04:31,813
Brass found
Nelson's truck

00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,482
about a block from
the crime scene.

00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:34,716
Had it towed in.

00:04:34,716 --> 00:04:37,018
Find anything?
Yeah.

00:04:37,018 --> 00:04:38,820
A piece of the dog's nail,

00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,722
and some dried blood
on the window.

00:04:40,722 --> 00:04:42,858
Dog clawed
his way out.

00:04:42,858 --> 00:04:43,992
(barking)

00:04:50,766 --> 00:04:53,535
So, if Nelson was off duty,
buying drugs,

00:04:53,535 --> 00:04:55,036
why bring the dog?

00:04:55,036 --> 00:04:57,906
Sergeant told me that the dog
lived with Nelson.

00:04:57,906 --> 00:04:59,141
Went everywhere with him.

00:04:59,141 --> 00:05:01,076
So... for protection?

00:05:01,076 --> 00:05:02,511
Well, if that's the case,
why would you

00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:03,979
leave the dog in the truck?

00:05:03,979 --> 00:05:05,547
Maybe that's what
he was trying to protect.

00:05:05,547 --> 00:05:06,815
In a neighborhood like that,

00:05:06,815 --> 00:05:08,416
you leave your truck,
you never know

00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:09,551
if it's gonna be there
when you get back,

00:05:09,551 --> 00:05:10,685
especially on Halloween.

00:05:21,396 --> 00:05:22,831
Department-issued envelope...

00:05:28,103 --> 00:05:29,771
...full of cash.

00:05:31,106 --> 00:05:32,841
Huh.

00:05:32,841 --> 00:05:35,343
Must be at least
five grand here.

00:05:35,343 --> 00:05:37,112
Could've been stolen
from Evidence.

00:05:37,112 --> 00:05:41,416
Could be this dog wasn't just
going after his partner,

00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:44,052
he was going after a dirty cop.

00:05:51,426 --> 00:05:52,828
Meet Barry Sloan.

00:05:52,828 --> 00:05:54,396
Big-shot lawyer.

00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:55,463
Lived alone.

00:05:55,463 --> 00:05:57,666
But I bet
he wasn't lonely.

00:05:57,666 --> 00:06:01,102
This place
reeks of money.

00:06:01,102 --> 00:06:02,437
Professionally decorated,

00:06:02,437 --> 00:06:05,407
impeccably clean...

00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:07,542
all to impress the ladies.

00:06:07,542 --> 00:06:09,778
Yeah, I've spent some time
in bedrooms like this.
(chuckles)

00:06:09,778 --> 00:06:11,613
Thought you were into cops.

00:06:11,613 --> 00:06:13,715
I do marry cops, but...

00:06:13,715 --> 00:06:15,517
I've dated some lawyers.

00:06:15,517 --> 00:06:16,985
They're fun to argue with.

00:06:16,985 --> 00:06:18,486
Hm.

00:06:18,486 --> 00:06:20,689
Boy, they can be sleazy
sometimes, though.

00:06:20,689 --> 00:06:22,858
Apparently, you're not
the only one

00:06:22,858 --> 00:06:24,726
who thinks so.
Police responded

00:06:24,726 --> 00:06:27,629
to a 911 call, shots fired.

00:06:27,629 --> 00:06:29,631
When they got here,
the shower was still running,

00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,032
but Mr. Sloan

00:06:31,032 --> 00:06:32,133
is bone-dry.

00:06:32,133 --> 00:06:35,871
GSW to the chest.

00:06:39,007 --> 00:06:42,010
Blood is confined
to this area, which means

00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:44,346
he must've been on the bed
or nearby when he was shot.

00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,483
Shooter missed at least once.

00:06:48,483 --> 00:06:51,353
Found a bullet hole
in the wall there.

00:06:51,353 --> 00:06:52,954
Based on the trajectory,

00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,890
looks like it came
from that direction.

00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:01,129
(camera shutter clicking)

00:07:03,832 --> 00:07:06,534
Radial cracks indicate
that the force

00:07:06,534 --> 00:07:08,603
must've originated
from the outside.

00:07:11,006 --> 00:07:12,941
(gunshot)

00:07:16,378 --> 00:07:18,613
Means our shooter was
on the outside of the window.

00:07:18,613 --> 00:07:19,781
Who called it in?

00:07:21,616 --> 00:07:24,552
(indistinct police radio
communication)

00:07:24,552 --> 00:07:27,355
(indistinct chatter)

00:07:27,355 --> 00:07:28,356
Mrs. Young?

00:07:28,356 --> 00:07:29,591
Ms.
Ms.

00:07:29,591 --> 00:07:31,660
I got tired
of being a housewife.

00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,828
Dumped the husband,
kept the last name.

00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:35,697
And his Jag.
Oh, lucky you.

00:07:35,697 --> 00:07:38,133
I had to pay
mine alimony.

00:07:38,133 --> 00:07:40,068
FINLAY: So, what exactly
did you hear?

00:07:40,068 --> 00:07:43,638
Well, I get up early every
morning to do my meditation.

00:07:43,638 --> 00:07:46,007
I had just reached an elevated
state of consciousness

00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:48,376
when I heard: bang, bang!

00:07:48,376 --> 00:07:50,111
So two gunshots in all.
Yeah.

00:07:50,111 --> 00:07:51,646
And what time was that?

00:07:51,646 --> 00:07:53,682
I looked at the clock.
It was 6:05.

00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:55,750
And did you see anything?

00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,485
Anyone?
Nothing.

00:07:57,485 --> 00:07:58,820
But then I had
this really bad feeling

00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,488
it had something
to do with Barry.

00:08:00,488 --> 00:08:03,024
Why do you think it had
something to do with Barry?

00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:05,093
Mm. A lot of people hated him.

00:08:05,093 --> 00:08:06,661
He was a real shark.

00:08:06,661 --> 00:08:07,996
Divorce lawyer.

00:08:07,996 --> 00:08:09,864
I've known quite
a few of those.
One time

00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:12,567
a brick came flying through
my window with a note attached.

00:08:12,567 --> 00:08:14,869
It said, "Burn in hell,
you scumbag lawyer."

00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,871
Meant for
Barry but...

00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:18,807
they got my house by mistake.
So, I guess

00:08:18,807 --> 00:08:21,609
Mr. Sloan was not very popular
in the neighborhood.

00:08:21,609 --> 00:08:23,411
Listen, I feel bad about what
happened to Barry, but...

00:08:23,411 --> 00:08:26,848
you ask me, our property values
just went up.

00:08:26,848 --> 00:08:29,617
That's a horrible
thing to say.

00:08:29,617 --> 00:08:31,553
The poor man just died.

00:08:33,855 --> 00:08:36,591
And how exactly
do you know Mr. Sloan?

00:08:36,591 --> 00:08:40,428
Oh, um, we've been neighbors
for 13 years.

00:08:40,428 --> 00:08:43,665
Oh, uh, Marjorie Randall.

00:08:43,665 --> 00:08:45,600
Look, when I had
my hip replacement,

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,803
Barry brought
in my mail every day.

00:08:48,803 --> 00:08:50,005
So you two were good friends?

00:08:50,005 --> 00:08:51,706
Oh, yes.

00:08:51,706 --> 00:08:53,808
Did he ever discuss
his work with you?

00:08:53,808 --> 00:08:55,944
Oh, he talked about it
all the time.

00:08:55,944 --> 00:08:57,445
He loved his job.

00:08:57,445 --> 00:08:59,681
Especially when he won a case.
Do you know

00:08:59,681 --> 00:09:02,851
if he was in the middle
of a particularly messy one?

00:09:02,851 --> 00:09:05,887
Barry just always said
that all divorces were messy.

00:09:07,822 --> 00:09:09,424
Do you think that
that could've had

00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:11,059
something to do with his death?

00:09:11,059 --> 00:09:13,995
We will do everything
we can to find out.

00:09:15,363 --> 00:09:16,664
(barking)

00:09:22,837 --> 00:09:24,873
How you doing with Cujo?

00:09:28,476 --> 00:09:29,711
I don't know.

00:09:29,711 --> 00:09:31,112
He's still pretty riled up.

00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,380
Well, why don't you wait
for Varanski?

00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,515
He's on his way back.

00:09:33,515 --> 00:09:34,849
He'll help you muzzle the dog.

00:09:34,849 --> 00:09:36,718
Then you can get your evidence.
By the time

00:09:36,718 --> 00:09:38,887
he gets here, all the evidence
is gonna be gone. Look at him.

00:09:38,887 --> 00:09:41,623
Look at him.
He's licking it all away.

00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:43,792
Hey, if you're thinking about
opening up that cage,

00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:45,593
we're gonna have
another crime scene.

00:09:45,593 --> 00:09:48,363
(sighs) Maybe he's just
threatened by me, you know?

00:09:48,363 --> 00:09:49,931
I mean, he's in there,
he's cornered,

00:09:49,931 --> 00:09:51,499
I'm coming at him
with sticks.

00:09:51,499 --> 00:09:53,134
Open the gate,
maybe he'll calm down.

00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,804
Nick...
Hey, come on.
Don't worry.

00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:57,839
I had a bunch of dogs growing
up-- know what I'm doing.

00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,507
(phone rings)

00:09:59,507 --> 00:10:01,843
All right, look,
I got Doc Robbins.

00:10:01,843 --> 00:10:04,079
Nick, that dog killed somebody.

00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:08,783
Wait for Varanski. Please.

00:10:08,783 --> 00:10:10,718
(dog growling)

00:10:23,064 --> 00:10:24,833
(growling)

00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,402
(barking)

00:10:27,402 --> 00:10:29,571
Well, boy...

00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,441
(sighs)

00:10:33,441 --> 00:10:35,844
(barks, growls)

00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:38,546
I'm not gonna let you
destroy all my evidence.

00:10:38,546 --> 00:10:41,015
(growls)
I'm gonna process you,

00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:43,985
just like any other suspect,
whether you like it or not.

00:10:43,985 --> 00:10:45,687
So...

00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:47,956
here's how it's gonna go down.

00:10:47,956 --> 00:10:50,458
I'm gonna let you
out of this crate,

00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:51,893
and when I do,

00:10:51,893 --> 00:10:54,796
you're gonna be cool...
and I'm gonna be cool.

00:10:54,796 --> 00:10:56,364
(low bark)

00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:57,799
Okay?

00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:59,100
(low growl)

00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:04,806
(low growl)

00:11:04,806 --> 00:11:06,074
Easy.

00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:09,344
(low growl)
Easy...

00:11:14,816 --> 00:11:16,584
Easy, now.

00:11:16,584 --> 00:11:18,353
(low groan)

00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,624
(low growl)

00:11:24,926 --> 00:11:26,761
(low growl)

00:11:27,862 --> 00:11:29,931
(growls, barks)

00:11:31,699 --> 00:11:32,867
(grunts, snarls)

00:11:32,867 --> 00:11:34,135
(barking)

00:11:34,135 --> 00:11:35,537
(growling)

00:11:35,537 --> 00:11:37,071
How about one of these?

00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,907
Huh?

00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:40,475
Want a little treat?

00:11:40,475 --> 00:11:42,110
Cooperate, now, okay?

00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,411
(barks)

00:11:46,614 --> 00:11:47,949
Right in here.

00:11:47,949 --> 00:11:50,852
Cooperate.

00:11:52,053 --> 00:11:53,588
Right in here, bud.

00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:55,089
Easy.

00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:56,424
(whines)

00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,096
Easy.

00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:04,566
You got something
in your teeth there.

00:12:06,501 --> 00:12:08,536
Easy.

00:12:08,536 --> 00:12:10,405
I'm not gonna hurt you.
(low growl)

00:12:12,907 --> 00:12:16,377
Well, it looks like you got
your pound of flesh, eh?

00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:25,386
ROBBINS:
When the kids were little,
I bought them a dog.

00:12:25,386 --> 00:12:26,721
A mutt from the shelter.

00:12:26,721 --> 00:12:28,423
He slept on my daughter's bed

00:12:28,423 --> 00:12:31,593
every night--
part of the family.

00:12:31,593 --> 00:12:33,494
Yeah, it's easy to forget
they're still animals.

00:12:33,494 --> 00:12:35,863
ROBBINS: It's hard to
make out the teeth marks.

00:12:35,863 --> 00:12:37,932
May have to call in
an odontologist.

00:12:37,932 --> 00:12:40,568
Well, maybe the saliva
will give us

00:12:40,568 --> 00:12:42,470
the dog's DNA.
You said our victim

00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,806
had drugs on him--
I don't see

00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:46,674
any needle marks.
Could be

00:12:46,674 --> 00:12:48,042
a new user.

00:12:48,042 --> 00:12:50,411
Maybe the drugs haven't
taken their toll yet.

00:12:50,411 --> 00:12:53,514
I'll send blood and hair
over to Tox.

00:12:53,514 --> 00:12:55,717
Multiple cuts and bruises,
defensive wounds.

00:12:55,717 --> 00:12:58,419
Boy, this guy
put up quite a fight.

00:12:58,419 --> 00:13:00,688
Why didn't he pull his gun?

00:13:00,688 --> 00:13:02,824
I think I know why.

00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:04,959
When the dog attacked Nelson,

00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:07,462
he must have knocked him over.

00:13:07,462 --> 00:13:08,796
(barking)

00:13:08,796 --> 00:13:10,932
(bone cracks)
<i>The angle of the fall</i>

00:13:10,932 --> 00:13:12,934
broke Nelson's arm
in two places,

00:13:12,934 --> 00:13:14,836
rendering the arm useless.

00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:16,671
Well, that explains
why he didn't shoot the dog.

00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:19,507
One mystery solved.

00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:22,477
♪ ♪

00:13:51,939 --> 00:13:54,776
♪ ♪

00:14:04,752 --> 00:14:07,355
Hey.
Hit the jackpot.

00:14:07,355 --> 00:14:09,424
Yeah?
.38 Special.

00:14:09,424 --> 00:14:12,560
Just like the slug
we took out of the wall.

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,063
That's not all I found:
fingerprints on the windowsill.
Killer saw

00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:16,831
quite a show.

00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:19,500
I found semen stains.
No way a guy

00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,836
like Sloan wouldn't
wash his sheets,
so they're fresh.

00:14:23,037 --> 00:14:24,038
And he wasn't alone.

00:14:24,038 --> 00:14:25,673
Lipstick?
Mm-hmm.

00:14:25,673 --> 00:14:29,143
Maybe Mr. Sloan was sleeping
with someone's wife.

00:14:29,143 --> 00:14:30,611
Or girlfriend.
Yeah.

00:14:30,611 --> 00:14:32,013
His job didn't
get him killed,

00:14:32,013 --> 00:14:33,981
his penis did.

00:14:41,122 --> 00:14:42,824
You're back
from the vet?

00:14:42,824 --> 00:14:44,625
Yeah. Yeah, they did
a full workup.

00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:45,893
The dog's healthy
as an ox.

00:14:45,893 --> 00:14:47,895
And his tox came back
clean, too.

00:14:47,895 --> 00:14:50,531
But if there's behavioral
issues, there's not
much they can do.

00:14:50,531 --> 00:14:53,534
Well, I guess that makes
him a dead dog walking.

00:14:53,534 --> 00:14:55,503
Yeah, unfortunately.

00:14:55,503 --> 00:14:58,773
Well, his tox wasn't the only
one that came back clean.

00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:00,675
No drugs in Officer
Nelson's system, either.

00:15:00,675 --> 00:15:02,610
Hair analysis proves

00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,879
that he wasn't
a regular user.
If he wasn't buying drugs

00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:06,914
in that part of town,
then what was he doing

00:15:06,914 --> 00:15:08,983
with all that cash
in his truck?
I don't know.

00:15:08,983 --> 00:15:12,120
But I can tell you
that he didn't steal
it from evidence.

00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,921
Money came from his
personal bank account.

00:15:13,921 --> 00:15:15,757
He made a series
of large withdrawals

00:15:15,757 --> 00:15:17,725
within the last
six months.

00:15:17,725 --> 00:15:19,460
Well, he was into something.

00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,629
ANDREWS:
Where's the dog?

00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,464
Animal Control.
ANDREWS:
What?

00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,767
No, they're gonna put him down--
you have to stop them.

00:15:25,767 --> 00:15:28,436
Why? What's going on?
The dog is innocent.
He didn't kill his partner.

00:15:28,436 --> 00:15:30,705
The saliva on Nelson's throat,
it isn't canine; it was human.

00:15:36,744 --> 00:15:40,114
(dog snarling)
BRASS:
<i>Start of the zombie apocalypse.</i>

00:15:40,114 --> 00:15:43,418
You know, we had a case where
a cheerleader, high on PCP,

00:15:43,418 --> 00:15:46,387
ate another
cheerleader's stomach.

00:15:46,387 --> 00:15:48,890
Nelson's killer
was high on something.

00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:50,892
Why was Nelson
in a Cracktown, anyway?

00:15:50,892 --> 00:15:52,860
He could've been setting
someone up, you know,

00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,062
planting evidence to
catch a bigger fish,

00:15:55,062 --> 00:15:57,398
things go south,
he gets killed, I don't know.

00:15:57,398 --> 00:16:00,802
But not before his partner
took a piece out of the killer.

00:16:00,802 --> 00:16:03,538
That flesh from the dog's teeth
came back to...

00:16:03,538 --> 00:16:05,473
an unknown male.

00:16:05,473 --> 00:16:07,408
(panting)

00:16:07,408 --> 00:16:08,709
(Sam whines)

00:16:10,378 --> 00:16:12,880
I guess Nick sprung him
from Animal Control.

00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,015
Ah, there he is. Sam.

00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:15,049
Hey, wha...?

00:16:15,049 --> 00:16:17,385
Sorry, he just got away from me.

00:16:17,385 --> 00:16:18,920
I can't have him
walking around CSI.

00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,087
I know. Come on.

00:16:20,087 --> 00:16:22,490
STOKES:
Sam, come on. Come. Hey.

00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:25,393
S...
Boy, you have a way
with dogs, Stokes.

00:16:25,393 --> 00:16:27,562
Hey, this pain in the ass may
help us find Nelson's killer.

00:16:27,562 --> 00:16:29,130
I mean, he is our only witness.

00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:31,799
Aw, no, hey, come on,
that's my anniversary gift!

00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:33,935
Drop it, Sam.
RUSSELL:
That is hand-carved.

00:16:33,935 --> 00:16:34,936
One of a kind.

00:16:34,936 --> 00:16:36,003
(whispers):
Drop it!

00:16:36,003 --> 00:16:37,738
(low growl)

00:16:37,738 --> 00:16:39,574
BRASS: I know he's a highly
trained police dog,

00:16:39,574 --> 00:16:41,709
but how the hell is he
gonna help with the case?

00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,444
He won't even
drop an anniversary gift.

00:16:43,444 --> 00:16:45,413
(Sam whines)

00:16:45,413 --> 00:16:46,881
(barking)

00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:48,583
(growling)

00:16:50,685 --> 00:16:52,887
(gunfire)

00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:55,923
Sergeant Varanski.

00:16:55,923 --> 00:16:57,825
(dogs barking)
Hey, Nick.

00:16:57,825 --> 00:16:59,627
Hey, man, how's it going?

00:16:59,627 --> 00:17:01,429
Good to see you.
Good to see you.

00:17:01,429 --> 00:17:03,431
Thanks for clearing his name;
you really saved his life.

00:17:03,431 --> 00:17:04,832
(Sam whining)
What you got there?

00:17:04,832 --> 00:17:06,100
Huh? What
you got, boy?
(low growl)

00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,602
Say, if it's all right with you,

00:17:07,602 --> 00:17:09,437
we'd like to hang on
to him for a while,

00:17:09,437 --> 00:17:11,506
see if he can help us
track down Officer
Nelson's killer.

00:17:11,506 --> 00:17:13,508
Sure. If anyone
can, it's Sam.

00:17:13,508 --> 00:17:16,511
Best nose in
the department.
There is one problem, though.

00:17:16,511 --> 00:17:18,112
I can't get him to do anything.

00:17:18,112 --> 00:17:20,114
He won't even drop
that stupid totem pole.

00:17:20,114 --> 00:17:21,983
Maybe you're not
speaking his language.
No?

00:17:21,983 --> 00:17:24,051
What's that, "dog"? I could
try barking or something.

00:17:24,051 --> 00:17:27,555
French. Sammy was born
just outside of Paris.

00:17:27,555 --> 00:17:29,490
All the dogs come to us
fully trained.

00:18:29,917 --> 00:18:31,519
Brent Walsh.

00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:33,721
A casino worker
in the middle of a divorce.

00:18:33,721 --> 00:18:35,690
And Mr. Sloan
was his lawyer.

00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:37,792
MAN:
<i>That arrogant,</i>

00:18:37,792 --> 00:18:39,994
despicable piece of crap.
I take it

00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:42,730
you weren't satisfied
with his services.
I'll say.

00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:44,665
He was too busy
satisfying my wife.

00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:47,468
They were sleeping together?
Sloan is supposed

00:18:47,468 --> 00:18:50,071
to protect my assets,
not hand everything over

00:18:50,071 --> 00:18:51,505
to that bitch.

00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:53,140
That's when I got suspicious.

00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:55,943
So you went to Sloan's
house last night.

00:18:55,943 --> 00:18:57,945
Yeah. I snuck in the side yard

00:18:57,945 --> 00:18:59,981
and I peeked in
the bedroom window.

00:18:59,981 --> 00:19:04,352
That's when I saw that scumbag
sleeping with the enemy.

00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:06,087
(moaning)

00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:11,092

<i>And then you waited</i>

00:19:11,092 --> 00:19:12,960

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,564
WALSH:
<i>No. I don't even own a gun.</i>

00:19:16,564 --> 00:19:18,599
I didn't want Sloan... dead.

00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:21,869
I wanted him... disbarred,
unemployed, homeless.

00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,037
But you were there.

00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:24,805
You had motive.

00:19:24,805 --> 00:19:27,441
I peeked in the window,
and then I left.

00:19:27,441 --> 00:19:29,110
Where'd you go?
I went to work.

00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,945
I'm a blackjack dealer at
the Tangiers, graveyard shift.

00:19:30,945 --> 00:19:33,114
I checked in at midnight
and finished my shift at 8:00.

00:19:33,114 --> 00:19:34,415
You can check surveillance.

00:19:34,415 --> 00:19:35,750
I will.

00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,686
Where can I find Mrs. Walsh?
At my house.

00:19:38,686 --> 00:19:40,454
With my cat.

00:19:40,454 --> 00:19:42,657
And all my stuff.

00:19:46,994 --> 00:19:49,597
You got something
on Officer Nelson?

00:19:49,597 --> 00:19:51,599
Yeah. I checked
his phone records.

00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:53,801
Couple of hours before he died,
Nelson got a call

00:19:53,801 --> 00:19:56,404
from a pay phone around
the corner from the crime scene.

00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:57,638
Liquor store cam

00:19:57,638 --> 00:19:59,874
caught a glimpse
of our mystery caller.

00:19:59,874 --> 00:20:02,710
Judging by the outfit, I'd say

00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:04,879
she's a working girl.
What's that
in her pocket?

00:20:06,881 --> 00:20:09,550
RUSSELL:
Yellow bandana.

00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:11,519
Just like the one
we found on Nelson.

00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:14,021
I'm thinking he
got the drugs from her.
DNA proved

00:20:14,021 --> 00:20:16,357
that a man killed Nelson,

00:20:16,357 --> 00:20:18,426
but if she was there,
she could be involved, right?

00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:20,561
Or, at the very least,
a witness.
Okay.

00:20:20,561 --> 00:20:23,397
I'll have Brass round up
all the hookers in Cracktown

00:20:23,397 --> 00:20:25,466
that look anything like her;
maybe our police dog

00:20:25,466 --> 00:20:27,768
can pick her out of a lineup.

00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:34,108
(quietly):
Oh, boy.

00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:35,576
Ladies...

00:20:35,576 --> 00:20:37,912
can I have your attention
for a second?

00:20:37,912 --> 00:20:40,481
Hi. First of all,
thank you for coming in.

00:20:40,481 --> 00:20:42,883
Did we have a choice?
No, not really.

00:20:42,883 --> 00:20:45,019
But I'll get you out of here
as soon as I can.

00:20:45,019 --> 00:20:47,521
Okay, open up your jars there.
Go ahead, open 'em up.

00:20:47,521 --> 00:20:50,891
Yeah, reach in
and pull out the pipe,

00:20:50,891 --> 00:20:52,359
and hold it in your hand.

00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:53,961
I'd rather hold on to your pipe.

00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,429
Uh, thank you,
I appreciate that,

00:20:55,429 --> 00:20:57,932
but my wife frowns
on that kind of thing.

00:20:57,932 --> 00:20:59,934
Where do you want me
to put this?

00:20:59,934 --> 00:21:02,036
Just hold on to it.
By doing that,

00:21:02,036 --> 00:21:04,472
you're transferring your scent
onto the pipe.

00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:06,006
If I rub it,
will it get bigger?

00:21:06,006 --> 00:21:07,675
Young lady,

00:21:07,675 --> 00:21:09,477
as long as you're holding it,
I'm happy.

00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:11,011
All right,
put 'em back in.

00:21:11,011 --> 00:21:13,881
Thank you.
Put the lids on.

00:21:13,881 --> 00:21:16,450
There you go. Come on.

00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:22,123
Look, Sam, I know we got
off to a bad start, and

00:21:22,123 --> 00:21:23,891
I know you miss your partner.

00:21:23,891 --> 00:21:26,827
You guys were together
a long time.
(whimpers)

00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:29,530
But I want the
same thing you do--

00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:31,532
to catch his killer.

00:21:31,532 --> 00:21:34,435
I can't do that
without your help.

00:21:36,637 --> 00:21:38,606
You understand?

00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:44,612
So... want to
go to work?

00:22:11,138 --> 00:22:12,807
Hey, Sam. How you doing, boy?

00:22:12,807 --> 00:22:14,041
(whines)

00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,477
Okay. <i>Trouvez.</i>

00:22:16,477 --> 00:22:18,879
(sniffing)

00:22:20,648 --> 00:22:21,782
(sniffing)

00:22:23,818 --> 00:22:25,586
(sniffing)

00:22:25,586 --> 00:22:28,856
(barks)

00:22:34,128 --> 00:22:36,130
Recognize this?

00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:38,799
Officer Nelson's partner did.

00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,701
He identified you
as the working girl

00:22:40,701 --> 00:22:42,002
who gave Nelson
this bandana,

00:22:42,002 --> 00:22:44,572
which was full of
methamphetamine, by the way.

00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,676
Hey.

00:22:48,676 --> 00:22:50,444
RUSSELL:
Carly,

00:22:50,444 --> 00:22:52,046
we know
you called Officer Nelson

00:22:52,046 --> 00:22:53,714
from a pay phone last night.

00:22:53,714 --> 00:22:54,949
We know you met up with him

00:22:54,949 --> 00:22:56,584
and gave him the drugs.

00:22:56,584 --> 00:22:57,785
And then you killed him.

00:22:57,785 --> 00:23:00,621
Gave him the drugs, that was it.

00:23:00,621 --> 00:23:02,389
Well, why would you do that?
He wasn't a user.

00:23:02,389 --> 00:23:03,824
Ms. Green,
we know all about you.

00:23:03,824 --> 00:23:05,860
We know that Officer Nelson
arrested you

00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,661
for possession
and prostitution,

00:23:07,661 --> 00:23:09,763
and sent you to prison
for nine months.

00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:11,498
Must have hated
him for that.

00:23:11,498 --> 00:23:14,134
BRASS: So, last night,
you lured him downtown

00:23:14,134 --> 00:23:15,970
and got one of your
junkie friends to kill him.

00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:17,605
No, that's bull.

00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:20,574
Mike was the only person
who gave a damn about me.

00:23:20,574 --> 00:23:22,977
He even visited me in prison.

00:23:22,977 --> 00:23:25,479
Okay, so why did
you call him then?

00:23:28,549 --> 00:23:31,585
Mike used to pay me for info.

00:23:31,585 --> 00:23:33,053
When something new
hit the streets,

00:23:33,053 --> 00:23:34,822
I'd turn it
over to him.

00:23:34,822 --> 00:23:36,624
Help him go after the dealers.

00:23:39,827 --> 00:23:40,828
Are you telling me,

00:23:40,828 --> 00:23:43,464
you're a C.I.?

00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:45,699
You were Officer Nelson's
confidential informant?

00:23:45,699 --> 00:23:48,068
Yeah.

00:23:48,068 --> 00:23:50,537
It was Mike's way
of giving me a second chance.

00:23:52,573 --> 00:23:56,543
Look, I gave him the drugs, told
him what I knew and beat it.

00:23:56,543 --> 00:23:59,413
When I left, he was still alive.

00:24:10,925 --> 00:24:12,960
What are you doing?

00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,462
The GCMS is broken,

00:24:15,462 --> 00:24:16,931
and the repairman's
on vacation.

00:24:16,931 --> 00:24:18,098
So you're fixing
it yourself?

00:24:18,098 --> 00:24:19,433
Are you even
qualified to do that?

00:24:19,433 --> 00:24:21,468
I am a man of many talents.

00:24:21,468 --> 00:24:22,736
I'm just saying,

00:24:22,736 --> 00:24:24,138
defense attorneys
love to challenge

00:24:24,138 --> 00:24:25,839
our findings in court,

00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:27,074
and if this is not fixed

00:24:27,074 --> 00:24:28,742
exactly to code,
you are gonna be in...

00:24:28,742 --> 00:24:32,112
Okay, can... can we just
forget the GCMS for a moment?

00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,050
Can you and I talk about...

00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:37,952
you know?

00:24:40,654 --> 00:24:42,690
No.

00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:44,425
So, we're just gonna pretend
like it never happened?

00:24:44,425 --> 00:24:46,460
Yes.

00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,896
Now, when you are
up and running,

00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:51,098
I need results
on the red smudge

00:24:51,098 --> 00:24:53,467
on my victim's shirt, please.

00:24:53,467 --> 00:24:54,535
Okay.

00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:55,703
Okay.

00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:56,837
(laughs softly)

00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:00,074
Thanks for stopping in.

00:25:00,074 --> 00:25:02,977
Yeah.

00:25:06,613 --> 00:25:08,515
So, you and
Hodges doing it?

00:25:08,515 --> 00:25:09,650
What? No.

00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:10,985
I think it's
great really.

00:25:10,985 --> 00:25:13,387
He's funny, he's
charming, smart.

00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:14,955
He's like an awkward
Jimmy Stewart.

00:25:14,955 --> 00:25:17,358
Okay, you know what?
I kissed him.

00:25:17,358 --> 00:25:18,425
Once.
Really?

00:25:18,425 --> 00:25:19,626
I was at the hospital.

00:25:19,626 --> 00:25:21,795
My dad had been shot.
It just happened.

00:25:21,795 --> 00:25:23,731
And now things are all awkward
between us.

00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:24,999
(sighs)

00:25:24,999 --> 00:25:26,533
Did you get anything
off the gun?

00:25:26,533 --> 00:25:28,035
Uh, did not get any prints,

00:25:28,035 --> 00:25:30,037
but it is definitely
our murder weapon.

00:25:30,037 --> 00:25:33,741
Striations matched the slug
we pulled out of the wall.

00:25:33,741 --> 00:25:35,509
And this is where
it really gets good.

00:25:35,509 --> 00:25:37,711
The gun was registered
to Barry Sloan himself.

00:25:37,711 --> 00:25:39,613
Shot by his own gun?

00:25:39,613 --> 00:25:40,948
Mm.

00:25:40,948 --> 00:25:44,752
So, Brent Walsh's
alibi checked out.

00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:47,521
But he claims that his ex
was sleeping with the vic.

00:25:47,521 --> 00:25:49,123
(moaning)

00:25:49,123 --> 00:25:53,560
Which would give her access
to Sloan's house and his gun.

00:25:54,628 --> 00:25:56,430
Let's bring her in.

00:26:00,868 --> 00:26:03,370
Hey, Doc, got your 911.
What's up?

00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:05,039
Body was just brought in.

00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,909
Fingerprints matched a person of
interest in your dead cop case.

00:26:08,909 --> 00:26:11,011
Okay, let's take a look.

00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,889
That's Carly Green.

00:26:23,357 --> 00:26:24,658
I interviewed her
earlier today.

00:26:24,658 --> 00:26:26,460
What--what happened to her?

00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,762
Found her at the Blue Siren
Motel with a needle in her arm.

00:26:28,762 --> 00:26:30,631
Apparent overdose.

00:26:30,631 --> 00:26:33,000
Yeah.

00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:39,573
Heard Hooker
Number Four OD'd.
Carly Green.

00:26:39,573 --> 00:26:42,443
Detective just logged in the
evidence from her motel room.

00:26:42,443 --> 00:26:44,445
Lots of condoms, needles.

00:26:44,445 --> 00:26:47,948
Live hard, die hard...
so to speak.

00:26:50,951 --> 00:26:51,952
Bloody bandage.

00:26:51,952 --> 00:26:53,821
Did Russell say anything

00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:55,722
about Carly having
other injuries?
No.

00:26:55,722 --> 00:26:57,524
Doc's doing her
autopsy right now.

00:26:57,524 --> 00:26:59,526
But I did find

00:26:59,526 --> 00:27:01,562
this LVPD envelope.

00:27:01,562 --> 00:27:03,764
It looks just like the one
we found in Nelson's truck.

00:27:03,764 --> 00:27:05,732
There's 800 bucks in there.

00:27:05,732 --> 00:27:07,534
Carly said Nelson
was paying her as a C.I.,

00:27:07,534 --> 00:27:09,136
so I checked with
Sergeant Varanski.

00:27:09,136 --> 00:27:11,872
Said Nelson hadn't worked
Narcotics in over a year.

00:27:11,872 --> 00:27:15,008
Well, Nelson must have been
paying her from his own pocket.

00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:17,778
Unless he was paying her
for something else.

00:27:17,778 --> 00:27:21,715
I mean, she was a hooker.

00:27:21,715 --> 00:27:23,417
She wasn't a thousand
dollar a night hooker.

00:27:23,417 --> 00:27:26,386
Something was going on
between them.

00:27:26,386 --> 00:27:29,089
ROBBINS: Carly Green
didn't commit suicide.

00:27:29,089 --> 00:27:31,425
D.B., take a look.

00:27:31,425 --> 00:27:32,893
Needle didn't hit a vein.

00:27:35,696 --> 00:27:37,598
RUSSELL:
She has track marks.

00:27:37,598 --> 00:27:39,399
She was a regular user.

00:27:39,399 --> 00:27:42,102
You'd think she'd know
how to find a vein.

00:27:42,102 --> 00:27:44,404
That's what
kept me looking.

00:27:44,404 --> 00:27:46,440
Found this.

00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,942
It's a needle mark
right in the middle of her back.

00:27:48,942 --> 00:27:50,544
She couldn't do that herself.

00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:52,880
So Carly Green was murdered.

00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,648
Well, there's more.

00:27:54,648 --> 00:27:56,450
Ms. Green was also pregnant.

00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:58,619
Based on the thickening
of the uterus

00:27:58,619 --> 00:28:00,888
and the size of the fetus,
I'd say about ten weeks.

00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:02,856
You know, she told me
that Officer Nelson

00:28:02,856 --> 00:28:04,591
was the only person
in her life

00:28:04,591 --> 00:28:05,759
who ever cared for her.

00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:07,895
You think he was the father?

00:28:07,895 --> 00:28:09,963
Well, he spent a lot of time
visiting her in prison,

00:28:09,963 --> 00:28:10,998
and he was giving her money.

00:28:10,998 --> 00:28:12,666
All right.

00:28:12,666 --> 00:28:14,701
Let's take a sample
of the fetus's DNA.

00:28:14,701 --> 00:28:16,570
Have Henry run it.
Absolutely.

00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:18,839
All this time,
I thought he was a dirty cop.

00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:21,108
Well, maybe he just got involved
with the wrong woman,

00:28:21,108 --> 00:28:23,510
trying to make things right.

00:28:25,546 --> 00:28:27,014
I didn't have sex
with Barry Sloan.

00:28:27,014 --> 00:28:30,017
Yeah, you did...
the night he died.

00:28:30,017 --> 00:28:33,554
We pulled your DNA
off of his... penis.

00:28:33,554 --> 00:28:34,988
Mrs. Walsh?

00:28:34,988 --> 00:28:37,357
All right, I did.

00:28:37,357 --> 00:28:40,994
I know it was wrong to sleep
with my husband's attorney,

00:28:40,994 --> 00:28:42,963
but sex with Barry was...

00:28:44,731 --> 00:28:46,633
He just kept you
coming back for more.

00:28:46,633 --> 00:28:49,036
We have evidence that you were
not the only woman

00:28:49,036 --> 00:28:51,605
who came back for
more last night.

00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:53,840
(chuckles)
Your DNA had company
on his penis.

00:28:55,576 --> 00:28:57,811
You know, the thing
about a three-way is,

00:28:57,811 --> 00:29:00,581
someone usually ends up
being the third wheel.

00:29:00,581 --> 00:29:03,350
It wasn't like that.

00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:05,786
I had wild sex
with Barry.

00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:07,621
When I was looking
for my clothes,

00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:09,423
I found lace panties in his bed.

00:29:09,423 --> 00:29:11,425
Not mine.
Then whose?

00:29:11,425 --> 00:29:12,659
Barry said he couldn't
remember her name.

00:29:12,659 --> 00:29:14,094
Some neighbor

00:29:14,094 --> 00:29:16,096
he was screwing.
And how'd that make you feel?

00:29:16,096 --> 00:29:18,098
Not angry enough to kill him,
if that's where you're going.

00:29:18,098 --> 00:29:19,466
But you were angry.

00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:21,101
Ooh, you bet your ass I was.

00:29:21,101 --> 00:29:22,836
We got into a big fight.

00:29:22,836 --> 00:29:24,605
Then I went home.

00:29:24,605 --> 00:29:25,973
What time was that?

00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:30,143
Around 5:30, 6:00.

00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:33,046
Hm. That's right around
the time he was killed.

00:29:38,685 --> 00:29:40,887
(sniffs)

00:29:40,887 --> 00:29:43,457
If you're really hungry, I'll
share half my sandwich with you.

00:29:43,457 --> 00:29:45,058
(laughs)

00:29:45,058 --> 00:29:47,661
No. It's for the dog.
He's not eating for some reason.

00:29:47,661 --> 00:29:49,596
Well, he lost his partner,
you know?

00:29:49,596 --> 00:29:51,131
He's probably still grieving.

00:29:51,131 --> 00:29:53,734
Yeah.

00:29:53,734 --> 00:29:57,104
Okay, here's
where we are.

00:29:57,104 --> 00:29:59,539
Henry matched the DNA
from the fetus

00:29:59,539 --> 00:30:01,942
to that piece of flesh that you
pulled from your dog's teeth.

00:30:01,942 --> 00:30:05,045
So Carly's baby daddy
isn't Nelson.

00:30:05,045 --> 00:30:06,713
It's the guy who killed him?

00:30:06,713 --> 00:30:07,981
That's right. Yeah.

00:30:07,981 --> 00:30:09,683
He killed Carly, too.

00:30:09,683 --> 00:30:12,619
That bloodied bandage
we found in her motel room?

00:30:12,619 --> 00:30:14,921
Yup.
Also the killer's DNA.

00:30:14,921 --> 00:30:18,058
And that's not all
Henry found in the bandage.

00:30:18,058 --> 00:30:20,661
Bacteria and leucocytes.

00:30:20,661 --> 00:30:22,929
The killer's wound is infected.

00:30:22,929 --> 00:30:24,765
From the dog taking
a bite out of him.

00:30:24,765 --> 00:30:26,933
He's going
to need medical attention.

00:30:26,933 --> 00:30:29,436
Robbins already checked
all the local hospitals

00:30:29,436 --> 00:30:30,937
and free clinics in the area.

00:30:30,937 --> 00:30:33,807
No dog bites reported
in the last 24 hours.

00:30:33,807 --> 00:30:35,442
Well, there are
some back alley clinics

00:30:35,442 --> 00:30:36,410
near the Blue Siren motel.

00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:37,544
What are you gonna do?

00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:38,912
You don't have a name.

00:30:38,912 --> 00:30:39,913
You don't know
who you're looking for.

00:30:39,913 --> 00:30:42,816
No... but Sam does.

00:30:42,816 --> 00:30:44,551
Hey, Sam?

00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:47,421
I got a little something
for you... here.

00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:52,959
(phone chirps)

00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:55,929
(phone beeps on)

00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:02,436
Thank God. Hey, I don't
know how he got in here,

00:31:02,436 --> 00:31:04,604
but you got to
get him out.

00:31:04,604 --> 00:31:07,674
I know, David.
I'm sorry.

00:31:19,386 --> 00:31:21,121
Hey, boy.

00:31:22,789 --> 00:31:25,092
Hey.

00:31:27,361 --> 00:31:29,096
(sighs)

00:31:29,096 --> 00:31:31,565
I should have known
I'd find you in here.

00:31:38,405 --> 00:31:40,640
You really loved him, huh?

00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,977
It's hard when
you lose a friend.

00:31:43,977 --> 00:31:46,446
You know, I lost a friend once.

00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:49,449
Partner in the line of duty.

00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:51,017
I think it'll always hurt,

00:31:51,017 --> 00:31:53,420
'cause...

00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,989
well, I know
I'll never see him again.

00:31:58,024 --> 00:32:01,061
But you know what
you can do for Mike?

00:32:01,061 --> 00:32:04,664
Together, you and me...

00:32:04,664 --> 00:32:07,534
we'll get a little justice.

00:32:07,534 --> 00:32:09,035
Sound good?

00:32:12,572 --> 00:32:14,508
(Sam whines)

00:32:21,548 --> 00:32:22,883
(quiet whirring)

00:32:22,883 --> 00:32:24,751
Did you know that,
in a lifetime,

00:32:24,751 --> 00:32:28,054
the average woman eats
four pounds of lipstick?

00:32:28,054 --> 00:32:30,590
And that helps our case how?

00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:33,660
I confirmed the red smudge on
Barry Sloan's shirt as lipstick.

00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,028
We knew that.

00:32:35,028 --> 00:32:36,797
Yes, but did you also know
that lipstick,

00:32:36,797 --> 00:32:38,031
like food, can go bad?

00:32:38,031 --> 00:32:39,699
And to preserve
its shelf life,

00:32:39,699 --> 00:32:41,968
cosmetic companies
used to use formaldehyde.

00:32:41,968 --> 00:32:44,137
There's formaldehyde
in my lipstick?

00:32:44,137 --> 00:32:46,106
Formaldehyde is
a carcinogen,

00:32:46,106 --> 00:32:48,575
so cosmetic companies
these days use metheneamine,

00:32:48,575 --> 00:32:50,644
which is a different
type of preservative.

00:32:50,644 --> 00:32:53,046
Okay, so what about
the lipstick in our case?

00:32:53,046 --> 00:32:55,649
Well, the lipstick
in our case contains

00:32:55,649 --> 00:32:57,818
straight formaldehyde,
and was manufactured

00:32:57,818 --> 00:33:00,720
by a company that went
out of business in 1972.

00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,424
Are you sure the GCMS
is working properly?

00:33:04,424 --> 00:33:06,059
I fixed it myself.
Oh, whatever
you say.

00:33:06,059 --> 00:33:08,628
But who wears
40-year-old lipstick?

00:33:11,398 --> 00:33:13,033
FINLAY:
<i>Mrs. Randall...</i>

00:33:13,033 --> 00:33:14,935
Oh, call me Marjorie.

00:33:14,935 --> 00:33:17,571
Marjorie, you told me
that you and Barry Sloan

00:33:17,571 --> 00:33:19,906
were good friends.
That's right.

00:33:19,906 --> 00:33:23,410
Good enough to have left
lipstick on his shirt?

00:33:24,945 --> 00:33:27,547
CSI's are searching
your house right now,

00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:29,616
and when they compare
your lipstick

00:33:29,616 --> 00:33:31,084
to the smudge on
Barry's shirt,

00:33:31,084 --> 00:33:33,386
I'm... betting
it's gonna match.

00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:35,889
Lots of women
wear lipstick.

00:33:35,889 --> 00:33:38,391
This sample was
much older than

00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:41,862
all of the women that
Barry was sleeping with.

00:33:44,865 --> 00:33:47,367
Were the two of you
intimately involved?

00:33:49,603 --> 00:33:53,373
My husband left me ten years
ago, for a younger woman.

00:33:54,774 --> 00:33:57,444
I never thought
I'd fall in love again.

00:33:57,444 --> 00:34:00,046
(laughs quietly)
Till I met Barry.

00:34:02,782 --> 00:34:06,520
For years,
I never told him how I felt.

00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:10,423
He always had some
beautiful woman on his arm.

00:34:12,025 --> 00:34:13,994
But the other morning,

00:34:13,994 --> 00:34:17,697
<i>I heard him arguing</i>
<i>with one of them.</i>

00:34:17,697 --> 00:34:19,566
Look, I never said
we were exclusive.

00:34:19,566 --> 00:34:21,701
You made me think we were.

00:34:21,701 --> 00:34:24,571
Come on, okay?
We've been having fun.

00:34:24,571 --> 00:34:26,606
You really are a
scumbag, you know that?

00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:29,009
Go to hell.

00:34:29,009 --> 00:34:31,411
<i>She was so mean to him.</i>

00:34:31,411 --> 00:34:33,980
So you saw an opportunity
to make your move.

00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,415
Well, I wanted him

00:34:35,415 --> 00:34:38,919
to know that he was...
appreciated.

00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,588
That he was loved.

00:34:42,656 --> 00:34:43,657
Marjorie.

00:34:43,657 --> 00:34:44,858
Everything all right?

00:34:44,858 --> 00:34:46,526
I heard you arguing
with that woman.

00:34:46,526 --> 00:34:48,595
I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to wake you.

00:34:48,595 --> 00:34:50,063
Oh, no, no, you didn't.

00:34:50,063 --> 00:34:52,966
I just wanted to make
sure that you're okay.

00:34:54,067 --> 00:34:56,836
You are so sweet.

00:34:56,836 --> 00:34:57,971
I don't deserve you.

00:34:59,673 --> 00:35:01,508
Mmm...
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:35:01,508 --> 00:35:02,809
What the hell
are you doing!

00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:03,977
I thought that...

00:35:03,977 --> 00:35:06,112
You're kidding, right?
Hey, come on,

00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:08,949
you're old enough
to be my mother. (scoffs)

00:35:10,784 --> 00:35:13,920
<i>He humiliated me.</i>

00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,589
(crying):
Just like my husband.

00:35:15,589 --> 00:35:16,823
And you've been

00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:18,525
carrying that anger
and that pain

00:35:18,525 --> 00:35:21,094
for all those years
since your husband left.

00:35:21,094 --> 00:35:23,830
So when Barry
rejected you...

00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,599
you snapped.

00:35:34,574 --> 00:35:36,443
(thump)

00:35:36,443 --> 00:35:38,111
(body thuds)

00:35:38,111 --> 00:35:41,414
Marjorie, we know that
the gun was Barry's.

00:35:41,414 --> 00:35:42,916
How did you get it?

00:35:42,916 --> 00:35:45,352
He gave it to me.

00:35:45,352 --> 00:35:47,654
There'd been some break-ins
in the neighborhood,

00:35:47,654 --> 00:35:48,855
and he wanted me to be safe.

00:35:50,924 --> 00:35:53,893
I just wanted to be loved.

00:35:55,562 --> 00:35:57,497
Is that so bad?

00:36:01,568 --> 00:36:03,503
(siren wailing in distance)

00:36:03,503 --> 00:36:05,505
The clinics down here
fly under the radar.

00:36:05,505 --> 00:36:07,440
If you can call them that--
no licensed doctors,

00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,808
no nurses, no questions asked.

00:36:08,808 --> 00:36:10,577
BRASS: Well, whatever
you want to call it,

00:36:10,577 --> 00:36:12,646
we're down to our last two.
Only could be the dog's

00:36:12,646 --> 00:36:15,915
lost his mojo.
Well, he can do this.

00:36:18,385 --> 00:36:19,786
(Sam panting)

00:36:22,822 --> 00:36:23,990
That's it.

00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:25,125
<i>Trouvez.</i>

00:36:25,125 --> 00:36:27,594
Go on.

00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:35,535
(Sam whines)

00:36:41,107 --> 00:36:42,676
(barks)

00:36:42,676 --> 00:36:44,044
He's got something.

00:36:46,346 --> 00:36:47,647
(Sam barks)

00:36:59,426 --> 00:37:02,062
BRASS (sighs):
Great, he wants a burrito.

00:37:02,062 --> 00:37:04,097
No, no.
Hang on a second.

00:37:10,637 --> 00:37:12,405
(Sam sniffing)

00:37:12,405 --> 00:37:14,074
(Sam whines, growls softly)

00:37:14,074 --> 00:37:15,675
(curious groan)

00:37:17,577 --> 00:37:19,079
(growls)

00:37:21,081 --> 00:37:22,115
(barks)
That's him!

00:37:22,115 --> 00:37:23,450
Police! Stop!

00:37:24,751 --> 00:37:26,619
(gunshots)
STOKES:
Move! Move!

00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:28,922
BRASS (over radio): Shots fired!
Officer in pursuit! Send backup!

00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:34,794
(panting)

00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:44,104
(Sam barks, snarls)

00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,608
(barking)

00:37:50,777 --> 00:37:52,445
STOKES:
Hey!

00:37:56,683 --> 00:37:58,985
(panting)

00:38:10,797 --> 00:38:12,832
(gunshot,
gun clatters to ground)

00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:15,068
(barks, growls)
(yelling)

00:38:15,068 --> 00:38:17,871
Get him off me!
I didn't do nothin'!

00:38:17,871 --> 00:38:20,840
I don't know, I'm kind of new
at this whole dog thing.

00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,042
Let me see, uh,
hmm--release him.

00:38:23,042 --> 00:38:25,645
(yelling)
Get him off me!
STOKES: No, no-- drop him?

00:38:25,645 --> 00:38:26,946
No, uh, it's...

00:38:26,946 --> 00:38:28,982
STOKES:
Hmm...
(yelling continues)

00:38:28,982 --> 00:38:30,817
<i>Laisser tomber.</i>

00:38:30,817 --> 00:38:32,819
(Sam barks)

00:38:32,819 --> 00:38:33,987
(pants)

00:38:33,987 --> 00:38:35,622
You see, the dog over there

00:38:35,622 --> 00:38:37,791
thinks that you
killed his partner,

00:38:37,791 --> 00:38:39,959
Officer Nelson.

00:38:39,959 --> 00:38:42,028
(siren approaching)
You know what I think?

00:38:47,934 --> 00:38:49,502
I think he's right.

00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:53,706
(Sam growls)

00:38:57,544 --> 00:38:58,945
You're under arrest for murder.

00:38:58,945 --> 00:39:00,947
Take this scumbag
to the hospital,

00:39:00,947 --> 00:39:03,416
then book him.

00:39:03,416 --> 00:39:06,386
Good job, Fido.

00:39:06,386 --> 00:39:07,854
STOKES:
Hey, Sammy.

00:39:07,854 --> 00:39:09,022
(chuckles)
(Sam whining)

00:39:09,022 --> 00:39:11,758
<i>Oui. Tres bien.</i>
(chuckles)

00:39:11,758 --> 00:39:13,560
Good boy.

00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,528
Good...

00:39:15,528 --> 00:39:17,831
(panting)

00:39:17,831 --> 00:39:19,132
(Sam whining)

00:39:21,634 --> 00:39:24,938
I need a little help here, boys!

00:39:24,938 --> 00:39:27,440
(Brass speaking indistinctly)

00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,610
Okay, sign it.
Sign it.

00:39:34,113 --> 00:39:35,748
(sighs)

00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:38,484
Did you get a confession?

00:39:38,484 --> 00:39:40,119
Vinnie was a regular songbird.

00:39:40,119 --> 00:39:42,689
He wanted Carly
to get rid of the baby,

00:39:42,689 --> 00:39:44,424
so she went
to Nelson for help.

00:39:44,424 --> 00:39:45,792
Well, Vinnie followed her.

00:39:45,792 --> 00:39:46,893
He sees them.

00:39:46,893 --> 00:39:48,094
He's loaded on methamphetamine,

00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:49,529
he's tweaking out of his mind,

00:39:49,529 --> 00:39:50,897
he kills Nelson
right in front of her.

00:39:50,897 --> 00:39:52,098
Poor Carly.

00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:54,534
Too scared to talk to us.

00:39:54,534 --> 00:39:57,737
Vinnie couldn't take the
chance, so he kills her.

00:39:57,737 --> 00:40:00,073
And her baby.

00:40:00,073 --> 00:40:02,609
STOKES: <i>I don't know;</i>
<i>I'm still waiting.</i>

00:40:02,609 --> 00:40:04,878
He's been in there
for a couple hours.

00:40:04,878 --> 00:40:07,747
Nah, nah, I'm okay.

00:40:07,747 --> 00:40:10,516
Hey, listen, I got to go.

00:40:10,516 --> 00:40:11,885
I'll call you back, okay?

00:40:11,885 --> 00:40:13,386
All right.

00:40:16,356 --> 00:40:18,057
So?

00:40:18,057 --> 00:40:19,125
How's he doing?

00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:21,027
Sam made it through surgery.

00:40:21,027 --> 00:40:22,762
And?

00:40:22,762 --> 00:40:25,531
Vet said he's going to be okay.

00:40:25,531 --> 00:40:27,000
(laughs quietly)

00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,935
Wow.

00:40:28,935 --> 00:40:30,703
Well, that's--that's good.

00:40:30,703 --> 00:40:34,073
I didn't even know Sam
had been shot.

00:40:34,073 --> 00:40:36,442
He just kept going.

00:40:36,442 --> 00:40:38,378
Mm. That's Sam for you.

00:40:38,378 --> 00:40:39,612
Ah, here he is.

00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:43,716
Hey, how you doing, boy?

00:40:43,716 --> 00:40:46,552
Huh?

00:40:49,055 --> 00:40:50,056
You did it, Sam.

00:40:50,056 --> 00:40:51,925
You caught Mike's killer.

00:40:51,925 --> 00:40:55,361
He's going to prison
for a very long time.

00:40:55,361 --> 00:40:56,896
And we got some justice.

00:40:58,798 --> 00:41:02,068
But don't you ever scare me
like that again,

00:41:02,068 --> 00:41:04,003
you hear me?

00:41:07,106 --> 00:41:09,142
You know, uh...

00:41:09,142 --> 00:41:11,611
Sam was going to retire
at the end of the year,

00:41:11,611 --> 00:41:16,683
spend the rest of his days
with Nelson, just being a dog.

00:41:16,683 --> 00:41:19,085
Nelson didn't
have any family, so, uh,

00:41:19,085 --> 00:41:21,454
Sam's going to
need a new home.

00:41:23,089 --> 00:41:26,025
Well, I guess he could
come live with me.

00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:27,860
That'd be nice.

00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,128
What do you say, Sam?

00:41:29,128 --> 00:41:31,631
I'll take
good care of you.

00:41:31,631 --> 00:41:34,600
Now, there's gonna be
a few rules, okay?

00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,069
No drinking out of
the toilet,

00:41:36,069 --> 00:41:40,073
and, uh, we watch
football on Sundays,

00:41:40,073 --> 00:41:41,741
and we root for the Cowboys.

00:41:41,741 --> 00:41:43,876
(whimpers)
Okay?

00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:45,645
And when
my girlfriend's over,

00:41:45,645 --> 00:41:48,114
you got to sleep
on the floor.

00:41:48,114 --> 00:41:49,582
All right? Is that a deal?

00:41:52,685 --> 00:41:54,420
(laughing)

00:41:57,657 --> 00:41:59,759
Okay, boy.

00:41:59,759 --> 00:42:01,794
<i>Ah, geez!</i>
