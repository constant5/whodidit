00:00:03,136 --> 00:00:06,840
MAN:
How does an eagle fly?

00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,675
With wings?

00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:12,446
I don't know. Ask the chicken
how that's working out.

00:00:12,446 --> 00:00:16,683
An eagle flies
because it is fearless.

00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:18,218
Using its force of mind,

00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:22,155
the eagle is the lord
of the sky.

00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:26,360
My name is Alan Quinn

00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,561
and I believe

00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:32,633
that you are <i>all</i> eagles.

00:00:34,268 --> 00:00:35,669
Thank you, friends.

00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:39,806
Thank you for visiting
this sacred paradise.

00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:43,243
If you join my week-long
"Force Of Mind" seminar,

00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:46,413
you... will... conquer... fire.

00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:49,483
Your fears will vanish.

00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:53,220
Your work, your relationship,
everything in your life

00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,389
will be enriched.

00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:58,358
Now who wants
to come fly with me?

00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:01,395
Come on! I don't see
every hand up.

00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:03,463
Who wants to come fly with me?!

00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:06,400
Come on! Let's go, people!

00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,568
Let's go!
Come on in the back there!

00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,506
Ciao, David.

00:01:12,506 --> 00:01:13,573
Oh... (chuckles)

00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,842
I wish you were here.

00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:17,711
HODGES:
<i>Ciao bella,</i> Elisabetta,

00:01:17,711 --> 00:01:20,380
<i>il mia amore.</i>
I wish I were there, too.

00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,282
You do? You're not avoiding me?

00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:24,251
Of course not. Work beckons.

00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:26,620
(chuckles)
It's so beautiful here.

00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,255
So empowering.

00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:29,823
Empowering?

00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:32,125
Sounds like you've been sipping
the Alan Quinn Kool-Aid.

00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:35,162
I'm about to enter
the sacred mud spring.

00:01:35,162 --> 00:01:36,196
Ugh, if I can't see

00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:38,231
the bottom, I don't go in.

00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:40,600
If you were with me,
you'd see something else.

00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,470
It's all natural here.

00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,340
I assume that this is
a private mud spring?

00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:50,377
Just me and nature.

00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:51,878
<i>Ciao,</i> David.

00:02:06,727 --> 00:02:08,228
<i>Ciao...</i> (speaks Italian)

00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:10,697
Is that your fiancé
on the phone?

00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:12,499
You're such a tease, huh?

00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:14,134
Have you told him about me?

00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,770
It's not the right time.

00:02:22,776 --> 00:02:26,246
Santo? <i>Non é buffo.</i>

00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:28,115
Not funny!

00:02:28,115 --> 00:02:29,649
(yells, laughs)

00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:32,252
<i>Mi hai fatto paura!</i>
You scare me!

00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:34,221
(speaks Italian)

00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:36,289
Stop kicking!

00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:37,424
I'm not kicking you!

00:02:37,424 --> 00:02:39,126
You, stop rubbing me.

00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:39,860
I'm not.

00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:49,569
(screaming)

00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:58,111
Welcome to your
hot springs nightmare.

00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:01,615
Floater in a
natural mud bath.

00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:04,451
Why does this place
look so familiar?

00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:07,287
Because Alan Quinn shoots
his infomercials here.

00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:08,822
This is his resort.

00:03:08,822 --> 00:03:09,823
Right.

00:03:09,823 --> 00:03:11,691
The "Force of Mind" guy.

00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,827
All over late-night TV.

00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:16,196
I don't think this'll make
his next ad.

00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,265
Watch your step.

00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:25,705
What do we got?

00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,607
It's a unknown male.
There's no I.D.

00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:30,577
Liver temp's ambient
with the mud.

00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:33,680
Body's bloated, but there's
no sloughing of the skin.

00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,849
I'd say he's been dead
at least 24 hours,

00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:38,418
but probably no more than 36.

00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:40,187
Heard a couple of bathers
found him.

00:03:40,187 --> 00:03:43,123
It floated up between them
while they were messing around.

00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:44,157
Yeah.

00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:45,592
And we know one of the bathers.

00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:47,561
RUSSELL:
That's Elisabetta.

00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,296
Hodges' girlfriend?

00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:52,732
Yep. She was taking a dip
with Fabio over there.

00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,768
They're sharing a room.

00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:56,503
She and Hodges are still
engaged, right?

00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:58,371
Far as I know.

00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:00,440
Hey, what is that right there?

00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,577
Looks like bruising.

00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:04,578
Maybe handprints?

00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:06,646
Could be he was held down.

00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:10,851
So, not an accidental drowning.

00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:14,688

Doesn't it?
Alan Quinn?

00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:14,114
Captain Jim Brass,
Las Vegas Police.

00:05:14,114 --> 00:05:15,649
Excuse me, birdman,
do me a favor--

00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,250
fly back to your room.

00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,487
I need to speak
to your spirit guide.

00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:23,890
Hey, what's going on, Alan?
Aren't you concerned

00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,259
that a murder victim was found
in your mud springs?

00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:28,228
Of course I'm concerned.

00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:29,663
It's a tragedy.

00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,197
Mr. Quinn, we're kind of hoping

00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:33,333
you could help us identify
the victim.

00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,801
As far as I know,

00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:36,736
every employee, every guest
has been accounted for.

00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:38,505
And I handed over our registry
to one of your guys.

00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:39,806
Well, somebody got stuck
in the mud.

00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:43,143
All I can think is, uh,
probably a hiker.

00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:44,811
Sadly some people can't
afford the entrance fee.

00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:46,279
So what do you think,

00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:48,214
they sneak down
from the hillside?

00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:49,683
If they're not a bother,
I look the other way.

00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:52,752
In the end, these springs
are for everyone, right?

00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:55,121
That's a beautiful
sentiment, Alan.

00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:56,890
But let me tell you
what's happening.

00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:01,194
Right now, these springs
and every inch of this ground

00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,729
belongs to us.

00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:04,331
You got it?

00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:11,838
BRODY: You know, I kind of miss
playing in the mud.

00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:15,308
Sacred bubbly mud.
Even better.

00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:18,178
Heard you might need
some extra on-site testing.

00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:20,413
I'm here to help.

00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:23,350
She's over by
the reception area.

00:06:27,354 --> 00:06:30,790
Elisabetta, Elisabetta,

00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,525
It was horrible, David.

00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:34,394
Oh, it's okay, it's okay.
I'm here.

00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,764
Now, I heard you were
with someone?

00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:40,166
<i>Si.</i> Santo.

00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:43,603
He's my brother, David.

00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:45,171
He's visiting from Tuscany.

00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:46,606
But I checked
the hotel register,

00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:48,775
and he has
a different last name.

00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:50,610
And you two were staying
in the same room.

00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,178
You don't trust me, David?

00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:54,681
I do, it's just
I want to,

00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:57,250
but I don't understand.

00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:02,389
Santo and I have different
last name because...

00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:04,290
I was married before.

00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,860
I keep my husband
last name.

00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,195
David, I was very young.

00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:10,864
Why didn't you tell me
you were married before?

00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:11,865
I tried.

00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:13,466
You've been so busy.

00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:14,734
You never have time for me.

00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:16,436
How much time does
it take for someone

00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,272
to just say, "By the way,
I'm divorced, Italian-style"?

00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,107
It was just one week.

00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,142
Not helping.

00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:23,810

Confirmation our

00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,857
Stomach contents are muddy.

00:08:47,857 --> 00:08:50,059
Also confirmation
we're dealing with a homicide.

In addition to the
apparent bruising

I also found this abrasion
on his forehead.

00:08:55,698 --> 00:08:58,100
Think he was hit
before he went in?

00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,102
Possibly.

00:09:00,102 --> 00:09:02,838
These were embedded
inside the wound track.

00:09:02,838 --> 00:09:05,207
Looks like wooden splinters.

00:09:05,207 --> 00:09:06,509
Maybe from a weapon.

The company uses Alan Quinn's
team-building techniques.

00:10:02,865 --> 00:10:06,702
Do you know, um,
if Justin had problems

00:10:06,702 --> 00:10:08,537
with any of his co-workers?

00:10:08,537 --> 00:10:10,906
No. He loved his job...

00:10:10,906 --> 00:10:12,808
our life together...

00:10:12,808 --> 00:10:16,011
We were just getting started.

00:10:16,011 --> 00:10:17,913
When was the last time
that you spoke with him?

00:10:17,913 --> 00:10:21,050
Uh...

00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:22,218
two days ago.

00:10:22,218 --> 00:10:23,919
This is so stupid.

00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:25,721
He didn't even want to go.

00:10:26,989 --> 00:10:28,991
I convinced him.

00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:31,160
Why didn't he want to go?

00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,963
He thought it was New Agey
and-and silly.

00:10:33,963 --> 00:10:36,031
I had stayed at the spa before,

00:10:36,031 --> 00:10:39,835
so I thought
it would be good for him.

00:10:43,872 --> 00:10:46,542
RUSSELL: Wow, look at that.
What wasn't in this mud bath?

00:10:46,542 --> 00:10:49,511
FINLAY:
Yeah, it looks like the day
after a frat party.

00:10:49,511 --> 00:10:52,615
STOKES:
Complete with the muddy
walk-of-shame evidence.

00:10:52,615 --> 00:10:54,149
The condoms are swabbed for DNA.

00:10:54,149 --> 00:10:55,818
Henry got no results.

00:10:55,818 --> 00:10:57,586
As well as the bottles
and cigarette butts.

00:10:57,586 --> 00:10:59,755
And that pigeon feather
is disgusting.

00:10:59,755 --> 00:11:01,223
Really, all of
this stuff looks

00:11:01,223 --> 00:11:02,725
like it's been down there
a couple of weeks

00:11:02,725 --> 00:11:04,059
except for this thing
right here.

00:11:04,059 --> 00:11:06,028
Doesn't even have
any mud on it.

00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:09,932
Can I see that thing?

00:11:09,932 --> 00:11:11,734
Mm-hmm.

00:11:16,238 --> 00:11:17,640
What are you doing?

00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,641
This is a...

00:11:18,641 --> 00:11:20,909
eagle feather, maybe?

00:11:20,909 --> 00:11:22,244
You know,

00:11:22,244 --> 00:11:24,013
you put this little tassel
thing on the end

00:11:24,013 --> 00:11:27,750
of the feather, you got yourself
a smudge feather.

00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,619
(chuckles): A what?
Smudge feather.

00:11:30,619 --> 00:11:33,222
Native American Indians
use it sometimes

00:11:33,222 --> 00:11:35,090
to waft incense around.

00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:36,925
My mom used to use

00:11:36,925 --> 00:11:40,095
a smudge feather to cleanse
the negativity from our house.

00:11:40,095 --> 00:11:42,264
I thought you said
your house was a van?
Believe me,

00:11:42,264 --> 00:11:44,133
that van needed
a lot of smudging.
Wait a sec.

00:11:44,133 --> 00:11:45,501
Smudge feather.

00:11:45,501 --> 00:11:46,969
Where have I seen that?

00:11:46,969 --> 00:11:50,973
Alan Quinn sent over a list
of everyone on the retreat.

00:11:50,973 --> 00:11:52,675
Opening day itinerary.

00:11:52,675 --> 00:11:56,245
He divided everyone
into teams of three.

00:11:56,245 --> 00:11:59,815
Each team was named
after a type of eagle.

00:11:59,815 --> 00:12:02,518
So, this is a
white-tailed eagle.

00:12:02,518 --> 00:12:05,054
And the feather symbol
that Alan Quinn gave

00:12:05,054 --> 00:12:06,855
to you and your
Bixton team--

00:12:06,855 --> 00:12:09,858
which consisted of you,
Heather, and Jessica Lowell

00:12:09,858 --> 00:12:10,859
and Justin Weed.

00:12:10,859 --> 00:12:12,194
First, let me say,

00:12:12,194 --> 00:12:15,230
as a citizen and as
a representative of Bixton,

00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:18,567
I want to cooperate fully
in this investigation.

00:12:18,567 --> 00:12:20,703
I very much
appreciate that.

00:12:20,703 --> 00:12:24,940
So, Justin's feather
was found in his room.

00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:28,110
And this feather
was found where he died.

00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:30,112
So, whose feather is it?

00:12:30,112 --> 00:12:32,781
Is it your feather or
is it Jessica's feather?

00:12:33,982 --> 00:12:36,819
(quiet, indistinct conversation)

00:12:36,819 --> 00:12:38,620
You and Jessica
need some time

00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,756
to get your
story straight?

00:12:40,756 --> 00:12:43,025
I have nothing to hide.

00:12:43,025 --> 00:12:44,893
We were both with Justin.

00:12:44,893 --> 00:12:47,763
Heather wanted
a team strategy meeting.

00:12:47,763 --> 00:12:49,965
Having it at
Club Mud was my idea.

00:12:49,965 --> 00:12:53,001
What time did you meet
at the mud bath?
Around 10:00.

00:12:53,001 --> 00:12:54,737
And what was
the mood in the mud?

00:12:54,737 --> 00:12:56,739
Was everything
cool with Justin?

00:12:56,739 --> 00:12:58,774
Justin was over
the whole Alan Quinn

00:12:58,774 --> 00:13:00,609
team-building-
eagle-flying-thing.

00:13:00,609 --> 00:13:02,644
He just wanted
to go home.
Sure.

00:13:02,644 --> 00:13:04,146
And what about you
and Heather?

00:13:04,146 --> 00:13:05,848
Who doesn't like
a free mud bath?

00:13:05,848 --> 00:13:07,783
Heather, on the
other hand,

00:13:07,783 --> 00:13:09,218
spent that last day
looking like she

00:13:09,218 --> 00:13:11,487
was gonna pop a button
on her pant suit.

00:13:11,487 --> 00:13:12,688
Why's that?

00:13:12,688 --> 00:13:14,723
She wasn't happy
with the team.

00:13:14,723 --> 00:13:15,724
HEATHER:
<i>I don't want</i>

00:13:15,724 --> 00:13:17,826
to speak ill
of the deceased,

00:13:17,826 --> 00:13:20,496
but Justin
let the team down.

00:13:20,496 --> 00:13:21,663
How so?

00:13:21,663 --> 00:13:23,632
He wouldn't do the firewalk.

00:13:23,632 --> 00:13:25,567
And why would that
concern your team?

00:13:25,567 --> 00:13:28,637
Alan Quinn sends
an assessment report
back to Bixton.

00:13:28,637 --> 00:13:30,639
Your team fails
mission objectives,

00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,174
you get a bad score.

00:13:32,174 --> 00:13:34,009
So you were
upset with Justin?

00:13:34,009 --> 00:13:36,812
Maybe even got into
a shoving match.

00:13:36,812 --> 00:13:40,582
Not liking your
insinuation here.

00:13:40,582 --> 00:13:44,153
They were both alive
and well when I left.

00:13:44,153 --> 00:13:47,055
So, you're saying
that Jessica and Justin

00:13:47,055 --> 00:13:49,057
stayed in the
mud bath together.

00:13:49,057 --> 00:13:50,626
Don't know what
happened after that.

00:13:50,626 --> 00:13:51,660
JESSICA:
<i>We just...</i>

00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,661
talked.

00:13:52,661 --> 00:13:54,029
He was distracted.

00:13:54,029 --> 00:13:57,166
I was half-naked and
he didn't even blink.

00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:59,735
All he could talk
about was his wife.

00:13:59,735 --> 00:14:02,070
Why are the good ones
always so boring?

00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:04,540
So, how'd the night end?

00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:07,075
We got out at
the same time.
Now wait a minute...

00:14:07,075 --> 00:14:10,546
(sighs) Justin got out
of the mud bath?
Yeah.

00:14:10,546 --> 00:14:11,613
We walked back together.

00:14:11,613 --> 00:14:13,549
I saw him go
into his room.

00:14:13,549 --> 00:14:15,951
What time was that?
Around 11:00.

00:14:15,951 --> 00:14:18,487
Okay.

00:14:18,487 --> 00:14:19,755
Thank you, Jessica.

00:14:19,755 --> 00:14:22,090
You can call me Jess.

00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:24,059
Any time.

00:14:26,895 --> 00:14:28,897
You text me?

00:14:28,897 --> 00:14:30,599
Indeed, I did.

00:14:30,599 --> 00:14:32,601
I understand our
women in the mud bath

00:14:32,601 --> 00:14:34,570
claim that Justin Wade
exited the mud?

00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:37,105
Yeah, yeah, before he
returned to it to drown.

00:14:37,105 --> 00:14:41,777
I sense your frustration
and I may have something
to assuage it.

00:14:43,645 --> 00:14:45,814
The bruising on the
victim's chest, right?
Mm-hmm.

00:14:45,814 --> 00:14:48,083
Histology results of the
tissue reveal fluid loss

00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:50,118
from damaged blood vessels.

00:14:50,118 --> 00:14:53,489
Swelling and blistering
that was obfuscated
from the bloating.

00:14:53,489 --> 00:14:57,092
Blistering. So you're
saying that he was burned

00:14:57,092 --> 00:14:58,126
before he was drowned?

00:14:58,126 --> 00:15:00,162
According to Doc Robbins,

00:15:00,162 --> 00:15:04,032
an inhaled substance
caused urticaria and angioedema

00:15:04,032 --> 00:15:06,201
along the interior of
the primary bronchi.

00:15:06,201 --> 00:15:08,537
I think the cause-- smoke.

00:15:08,537 --> 00:15:10,539
Okay.

00:15:10,539 --> 00:15:13,775
And, you recall that Justin Wade
had splinters in his forehead?

00:15:13,775 --> 00:15:15,744
Yeah, he was hit by some kind
of weapon, right?

00:15:15,744 --> 00:15:17,546
I think not.

00:15:17,546 --> 00:15:20,949
The splinters are wood from
the Northwestern Red Cedar.

00:15:20,949 --> 00:15:23,485
It's a tree that's sacred
to Native Americans

00:15:23,485 --> 00:15:25,554
used in rituals and
rites of passage.

00:15:25,554 --> 00:15:28,156
Like Alan Quinn's firewalks.

00:15:28,156 --> 00:15:30,726
Wood in his head,
smoke in his lungs.

00:15:30,726 --> 00:15:34,930
I think between dips in the mud,
Justin Wade played with fire.

00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:37,232
And, I can prove it.

00:15:37,232 --> 00:15:39,668
If... you'll firewalk this way.

00:15:45,974 --> 00:15:48,110
First of all,
walking across hot coals

00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:50,712
doesn't take force of mind,
it takes force of physics.

00:15:50,712 --> 00:15:53,248
Coal's lightweight
carbon structure

00:15:53,248 --> 00:15:55,584
is a poor conductor of heat.

00:15:55,584 --> 00:15:58,253
The layer of ash further
insulates the heat.

00:15:58,253 --> 00:16:00,122
Firewalks are
conducted at night

00:16:00,122 --> 00:16:02,190
so you see the
red, burning coals,

00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:04,526
and not the layer of
ash that coats them.

00:16:04,526 --> 00:16:05,561
Phew, whoa!

00:16:05,561 --> 00:16:06,695
You sure about this?

00:16:06,695 --> 00:16:08,564
That's hot enough
to cook meat.

00:16:08,564 --> 00:16:10,465
But your feet only make contact
for two-tenths of a second.

00:16:10,465 --> 00:16:15,671
The key is to walk
softly and steadily.

00:16:20,809 --> 00:16:23,478
<i>Ecco, amico mio.</i>

00:16:23,478 --> 00:16:25,681
I am an eagle!

00:16:25,681 --> 00:16:26,848
All right, what
about the victim?

00:16:26,848 --> 00:16:28,150
He didn't receive his wings.

00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:30,085
While we know
that Justin Wade

00:16:30,085 --> 00:16:31,954
was a reluctant
spiritual warrior,

00:16:31,954 --> 00:16:34,022
Heather, his teammate,
was unhappy

00:16:34,022 --> 00:16:35,824
with his unwillingness
to walk the fire.

00:16:35,824 --> 00:16:37,125
So you think that

00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:39,628
after Heather berated
him in the mud bath,

00:16:39,628 --> 00:16:42,264
he went back to his room,
and he warriored up,

00:16:42,264 --> 00:16:44,232
and he gave it a shot.

00:16:44,232 --> 00:16:46,068
Bad shot.

00:16:46,068 --> 00:16:49,705
I think he panicked
halfway across,

00:16:49,705 --> 00:16:51,506
tripped and fell.

00:16:51,506 --> 00:16:53,842
Forehead hitting an
unburned piece of cedar.

00:16:53,842 --> 00:16:56,979
Discoloration on the chest that
we thought was bruising...

00:16:56,979 --> 00:16:58,246
was really burns.

00:16:58,246 --> 00:17:01,016
You know, the firewalk
was fenced off

00:17:01,016 --> 00:17:02,718
from the rest of the spa.

00:17:02,718 --> 00:17:04,686
Even if Justin Wade
warriored up,

00:17:04,686 --> 00:17:06,655
there's only one person
who conducts the firewalk.

00:17:06,655 --> 00:17:08,657
Alan Quinn.
Bad for business

00:17:08,657 --> 00:17:11,793
if a client ends up
with third-degree burns
and in the hospital.

00:17:11,793 --> 00:17:15,197
Better if he ends up
accidentally drowned
in the mud bath.

00:17:15,197 --> 00:17:18,800
Letting the healing waters
cover up all the sins.

00:17:28,944 --> 00:17:32,214
Justin Wade...
the floater in your mud.

00:17:32,214 --> 00:17:35,550
He wasn't a hiker,
he was your client.

00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:37,219
We have evidence
that ties Justin

00:17:37,219 --> 00:17:39,921
to the kind of cedar
wood that you use
in your firewalk.

00:17:39,921 --> 00:17:42,858
BRASS: He wanted to make a
firewalk to help his team.

00:17:42,858 --> 00:17:44,926
He needed your
guidance, maybe?

00:17:44,926 --> 00:17:47,796
BRASS:
Didn't turn out
so good, huh?

00:17:47,796 --> 00:17:48,997
Come on, Alan.

00:17:48,997 --> 00:17:50,132
You lied to us.

00:17:50,132 --> 00:17:52,100
You were with
Justin that night.

00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,770
Force of mind.

00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:56,038
Be brave.

00:17:56,038 --> 00:17:58,974
Tell us
what happened.

00:17:58,974 --> 00:18:02,010
I had no idea
it was Justin.

00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,645
Uh, he called me
to his room,

00:18:03,645 --> 00:18:05,147
wanted to do a firewalk.

00:18:05,147 --> 00:18:06,648
So, you took him up there?
No.

00:18:06,648 --> 00:18:09,951
Uh, I sensed
he wasn't ready.

00:18:09,951 --> 00:18:12,087
You know, I'd rather have
someone not do the walk

00:18:12,087 --> 00:18:13,689
than try and fail.

00:18:13,689 --> 00:18:15,090
Told him to go to bed.

00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:16,091
What time was this?

00:18:16,091 --> 00:18:17,793
Around 11:30.

00:18:17,793 --> 00:18:19,094
Went home after that.

Hey, Doc.
Hey.

00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,612

I am looking

00:18:37,612 --> 00:18:40,082
at a sample from Justin Wade's
bronchial tissue.

00:18:40,082 --> 00:18:42,517
I don't think the smoke
from the firewalk

00:18:42,517 --> 00:18:43,785
caused this inflammation.

00:18:43,785 --> 00:18:45,187
Take a look.

00:18:47,656 --> 00:18:49,825
ROBBINS:
He had an acute mast cell
degranulation

00:18:49,825 --> 00:18:52,094

tryptases and chymases.

00:18:54,796 --> 00:18:57,566

anaphylactic shock.

00:18:57,566 --> 00:18:59,768
Caused by what?

Unknown. I only see
effect, not cause.

00:19:02,104 --> 00:19:04,106
That's weird.
We thought that Justin Wade

00:19:04,106 --> 00:19:07,542
fell in the fire because
he had an anxiety attack.

00:19:07,542 --> 00:19:10,045
No, what he really had
was an allergy attack.

00:19:10,045 --> 00:19:12,247
Okay, well, I'll send
this tissue up to Hodges,

00:19:12,247 --> 00:19:16,084

He doesn't speak

Mm, I'm not doing it.

Common household items:
swim cap,

hot water bottle, balloons,
cleaning gloves,

00:21:02,724 --> 00:21:04,826
bath mat, shower curtain--

Greg's at the primary now,
looking for the culprit.

00:21:43,064 --> 00:21:45,600
Interesting theory.

00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,937
You know, latex allergy's
kind of a personal thing.

00:21:48,937 --> 00:21:50,939
Yeah, something only
a spouse might know of.

00:21:52,974 --> 00:21:54,943
Justin Wade's wife,
Mary, told me

00:21:54,943 --> 00:21:57,512
that she'd been
to Alan Quinn's spa before.

00:21:57,512 --> 00:21:59,748
So she knows
all about the firewalk.

00:22:07,822 --> 00:22:09,724
Just sayin'.

00:22:09,724 --> 00:22:11,927
Could be a cause for murder.

00:22:11,927 --> 00:22:14,863
I'm assuming you're aware your
husband had a latex allergy,

00:22:14,863 --> 00:22:16,097
Mrs. Wade?

00:22:16,097 --> 00:22:17,832
Yes, why?

00:22:17,832 --> 00:22:19,634
We discovered that he had
an extreme allergic reaction

00:22:19,634 --> 00:22:21,069
before he died.

00:22:21,069 --> 00:22:23,672
But he was always so careful.

00:22:23,672 --> 00:22:25,740
You said it was all
good between you two?

00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,108
That's right.

00:22:27,108 --> 00:22:29,477
Well, not according
to his phone records.

00:22:29,477 --> 00:22:30,845
About three weeks ago,

00:22:30,845 --> 00:22:33,148
Jessica Lowell

00:22:33,148 --> 00:22:35,216
A lot.
Work calls, I'd imagine.

00:22:42,891 --> 00:22:44,859
Mary, you told me that you were
home the night that Justin died.

00:22:44,859 --> 00:22:46,628
But that isn't true, is it?

8:30 p.m.

00:22:53,134 --> 00:22:55,937
Okay, I...

00:22:55,937 --> 00:22:57,739
realize how this must look.

00:22:57,739 --> 00:22:58,940
Looks bad.

00:23:07,515 --> 00:23:09,084

Yes.

00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,988
Okay, I filled up
my car, and I...

00:23:12,988 --> 00:23:14,789

is Jessica Lowell--
maybe she poisoned them both.

00:26:49,237 --> 00:26:50,772
Do we know where she is yet?

00:26:50,772 --> 00:26:52,707
Still in the wind.

00:26:52,707 --> 00:26:54,809
ROBBINS: Haven't had a chance
to open up Heather Conner yet,

00:26:54,809 --> 00:26:57,579
to determine C.O.D.--

00:26:57,579 --> 00:26:59,981
but, in the washroom,
David found this.

00:26:59,981 --> 00:27:02,550
White powder under
her fingernails.

00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,819
Hodges says it's
magnesium sulfate.

00:27:04,819 --> 00:27:06,988
Common dietary supplement.

00:27:06,988 --> 00:27:08,957
Yeah, David found a
receipt in her purse.

00:27:08,957 --> 00:27:11,125
She'd been stocking up on all
sorts of nutrients and powders.

00:27:11,125 --> 00:27:15,129
Maybe Jessica Lowell spiked
her vitamin shake.

00:27:15,129 --> 00:27:16,531
Could explain her death.

00:27:16,531 --> 00:27:18,533
Now for the unexplainable.

00:27:19,601 --> 00:27:21,769
David also found...

00:27:21,769 --> 00:27:24,205
strands of animal hair.

00:27:24,205 --> 00:27:27,709
Hodges I.D.'d it
as <i>capra aegagrus hircus.</i>

00:27:27,709 --> 00:27:29,110
Goat?
Yeah.

00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:31,145
She had goat hair
all over her.

00:27:31,145 --> 00:27:32,747
I didn't say it made sense.

00:27:32,747 --> 00:27:34,816
Mm, something better
start making sense.

00:27:40,021 --> 00:27:42,490
You here on business or
to make another girl date

00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:44,559
with my fiancée?

00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:45,994
She told you we met.

00:27:45,994 --> 00:27:49,464
No, uh, she texted
me by mistake.

00:27:49,464 --> 00:27:52,166
"Morgan, thank you
for listening.

00:27:52,166 --> 00:27:53,601
My new <i>amica."</i>

00:27:53,601 --> 00:27:56,204
She just wanted to talk.

00:27:56,204 --> 00:27:59,707
Look, I'm on your
side, Hodges.

00:27:59,707 --> 00:28:00,875
She's a great girl.

00:28:00,875 --> 00:28:02,810
Who feels that I'm backing away.

00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:04,612
Are you?

00:28:07,482 --> 00:28:10,051
Ah, saved by the tox report.

00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,888
Whoa.

00:28:13,888 --> 00:28:15,189
Heather Conner

00:28:15,189 --> 00:28:17,025
was higher than Elvis
at the Vegas Hilton.

00:28:17,025 --> 00:28:19,160
So she wasn't poisoned.

00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,595
She O.D.'d.

00:28:20,595 --> 00:28:22,130
Makes sense.

00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:23,598
You said you found
magnesium sulfate

00:28:23,598 --> 00:28:24,966
underneath
her fingernails, right?

00:28:24,966 --> 00:28:27,135
Yeah, I thought that was
from a vitamin drink.

00:28:27,135 --> 00:28:29,103
But it's also used
to manufacture meth.

00:28:29,103 --> 00:28:32,006
Drug sales rep
becomes drug cook,

00:28:32,006 --> 00:28:33,141
becomes drug addict.

00:28:33,141 --> 00:28:35,176
Deadly career path.

00:28:35,176 --> 00:28:37,645
So, she's tweaking on meth,
she's called in by PD.

00:28:37,645 --> 00:28:40,181
She's worried that we figured
it all out-- the illegal drugs.

00:28:40,181 --> 00:28:42,050
She takes some downers
to calm down.

00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:45,520
And she downs herself forever,
right in front of us.

00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,656
I hear you get very
thirsty on meth.

00:28:48,656 --> 00:28:50,925
Check out the
stomach contents.

00:28:50,925 --> 00:28:54,629
"Lacteal secretions high in
potassium, niacin and copper."

00:28:54,629 --> 00:28:55,630
Milk.

00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:56,964
Goat milk.

00:28:56,964 --> 00:28:58,032
The udder milk.

00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,168
Come on, it's too easy.

00:29:00,168 --> 00:29:02,503
No, it's too much goat.

00:29:02,503 --> 00:29:04,138
We found goat hair
on Heather's clothes.

00:29:05,206 --> 00:29:07,909
(cell phone dings)

00:29:07,909 --> 00:29:10,511
Text from Nick.

00:29:10,511 --> 00:29:12,180
Our prime suspect,
Jessica Lowell,

00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:14,048
just turned herself in.

00:29:14,048 --> 00:29:16,751
STOKES:
Thought you were on the run.

00:29:16,751 --> 00:29:17,985
Business trip.

00:29:17,985 --> 00:29:19,787
I came back as
soon as possible.

00:29:19,787 --> 00:29:20,822
I want to cooperate.

00:29:20,822 --> 00:29:21,989
Well, that's good.

00:29:21,989 --> 00:29:24,092
You knew the murder victim
Justin Wade.

00:29:24,092 --> 00:29:25,827
The guy who was drowned
in a mud bath?

00:29:25,827 --> 00:29:26,961
STOKES:
We found your prints

00:29:26,961 --> 00:29:29,063
on the latex pellets
that were tossed

00:29:29,063 --> 00:29:30,932
into the firewalk
to knock Justin out.

00:29:30,932 --> 00:29:32,800
Those pellets were samples.

00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,670
We all had them
at the retreat.

00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:37,138
Captain Brass, I believe
you know Colin Garrett

00:29:37,138 --> 00:29:39,040
with the FBI field office here.

00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:42,143
Mm-hmm.
We're working together.

00:29:42,143 --> 00:29:43,644
I'm not a sales rep.

00:29:43,644 --> 00:29:45,146
I handle corporate
security at Bixton.

00:29:45,146 --> 00:29:47,682
I'm teamed up with
the FBI right now.

00:29:47,682 --> 00:29:50,118
Justin Wade and Heather Conner
were under investigation

00:29:50,118 --> 00:29:53,087
for stealing research and drugs
to manufacture designer meth.

00:29:53,087 --> 00:29:56,557
Just slip your mind
to mention that to me before?

00:29:56,557 --> 00:29:58,092
And the last time I checked,

00:29:58,092 --> 00:30:00,728
big pharmaceuticals
don't sell street meth.
No.

00:30:00,728 --> 00:30:02,263
But we have all
the chemicals at hand,

00:30:02,263 --> 00:30:04,532
and cutting-edge lab technology.

00:30:04,532 --> 00:30:06,634
We believe they set up
a lab somewhere.

00:30:06,634 --> 00:30:07,869
BRASS:
Well, that still doesn't explain

00:30:07,869 --> 00:30:08,936
how Justin ended up dead.

00:30:08,936 --> 00:30:11,072
Are you familiar
with Rolan Zahl?

00:30:11,072 --> 00:30:13,474
Drug distributor-- bad news.

00:30:13,474 --> 00:30:15,109
JESSICA:
Worse news for Justin.

00:30:15,109 --> 00:30:16,911
Zahl was his street connect.

00:30:16,911 --> 00:30:19,514
Feds think that once he
finished with the lab,

00:30:19,514 --> 00:30:21,082
he became expendable.

00:30:21,082 --> 00:30:23,584
So you're saying
that Justin Wade's murder

00:30:23,584 --> 00:30:24,719
was a drug hit?

00:30:24,719 --> 00:30:27,522
You have a better theory?

00:30:27,522 --> 00:30:29,724
Did you follow up on the
Rolan Zahl drug angle?

00:30:29,724 --> 00:30:31,259
Yup, I tested
some meth pulled off

00:30:31,259 --> 00:30:33,261
a Mad-10 dealer two days ago.

00:30:33,261 --> 00:30:35,863
Same trace contaminants we
found in Heather Conner?

00:30:35,863 --> 00:30:37,465
To a tee.

00:30:37,465 --> 00:30:40,501
Okay, well, I did a little
follow-up of my own

00:30:40,501 --> 00:30:42,603
on the magnesium sulfate

00:30:42,603 --> 00:30:44,605
from, uh, Heather's
fingernails.
Uh-huh.

00:30:44,605 --> 00:30:46,741
According to her credit cards,
she bought about

00:30:46,741 --> 00:30:49,010
200 pounds of the stuff
last month,

00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:50,478
from a medical
supply company.

00:30:50,478 --> 00:30:53,714
And it was shipped
to Greenlore Scientific.

00:30:53,714 --> 00:30:56,083
AKA our secret meth lab.
That's right.

00:30:56,083 --> 00:30:57,752
Looks like it's time
to pay a visit

00:30:57,752 --> 00:31:00,221
to 93644 Dagwood Street.

00:31:02,156 --> 00:31:04,091
(sirens wailing)

00:31:12,467 --> 00:31:13,801
LVPD! Open up!

00:31:16,003 --> 00:31:18,039
LVPD! Open up!

00:31:18,039 --> 00:31:19,607
Go, Stokes.

00:31:26,247 --> 00:31:28,616
LVPD! Open up!

00:31:28,616 --> 00:31:29,717
Go.

00:31:42,196 --> 00:31:44,499
(bleating)

00:31:44,499 --> 00:31:46,567
What the...?

00:31:47,935 --> 00:31:50,104
(glass breaks nearby,
goat bleats)

00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:02,116
(door creaking)

00:32:15,696 --> 00:32:18,533
Looks like they cleared out.

00:32:18,533 --> 00:32:20,735
Think we found our lab.

00:32:20,735 --> 00:32:21,836
Yeah, what's left of it.

00:32:21,836 --> 00:32:24,105
Hold on, Nick.

00:32:24,105 --> 00:32:25,540
Check this out.

00:32:28,042 --> 00:32:29,243
Well, somebody
trashed the place.

00:32:35,917 --> 00:32:39,554
This is too elaborate just
to manufacture meth.

00:32:42,189 --> 00:32:44,492
Industrial fridge.

00:32:44,492 --> 00:32:46,527
Don't usually see that
in a meth lab.

00:32:46,527 --> 00:32:47,895
Nope.

00:32:51,732 --> 00:32:53,601
Got milk?

00:32:53,601 --> 00:32:56,637
Right-- goat's milk,
I'm guessing.

00:32:56,637 --> 00:32:59,807
SIDLE: Distillation condenser--
this is some very

00:32:59,807 --> 00:33:01,208
complex chemistry.

00:33:01,208 --> 00:33:03,711
STOKES:
Microporous membranes?

00:33:03,711 --> 00:33:05,813
You don't use that to make meth.
I got to say

00:33:05,813 --> 00:33:08,015
a lot of the stuff
in here just doesn't fit

00:33:08,015 --> 00:33:10,084
with making street drugs.

00:33:10,084 --> 00:33:11,986
(distant thump)

00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,542
Mrs. Wade?!

00:33:34,542 --> 00:33:36,644
Please don't hurt me.

00:33:44,885 --> 00:33:46,954
SANDERS: Nick's still
collecting evidence,

00:33:46,954 --> 00:33:49,590
but he sent over some trace
from the farmhouse lab.

00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:51,092
It's definitely meth.

00:33:51,092 --> 00:33:52,593
So, what do you think?

00:33:52,593 --> 00:33:54,095
Husband and wife
cooking team?

00:33:54,095 --> 00:33:56,097
Looks like it.

00:33:56,097 --> 00:33:58,199
"Looks like it"?

00:33:58,199 --> 00:34:00,701
The goat milk
doesn't make sense.

00:34:00,701 --> 00:34:02,069
Well, maybe it's

00:34:02,069 --> 00:34:04,071
some kind of
cutting agent for the meth.

00:34:04,071 --> 00:34:05,072
Ah, it's more than that.

00:34:05,072 --> 00:34:06,540
There was...

00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,643
a lot of sophisticated
equipment in that lab;

00:34:08,643 --> 00:34:11,479
stuff you don't
need to make meth.

00:34:17,184 --> 00:34:20,821
Something else was cooking
in that kitchen.

00:34:20,821 --> 00:34:21,756
(coughs)

00:34:26,727 --> 00:34:28,095
(door opens)

00:34:31,632 --> 00:34:34,769
I know you think Justin,
Heather and I are all
meth dealers.

00:34:36,103 --> 00:34:37,104
Yeah, I do.

00:34:37,104 --> 00:34:38,706
And I know why:

00:34:38,706 --> 00:34:40,841
you need the money
because you're sick.

00:34:42,843 --> 00:34:47,982
I... have a chronic deficiency
of the antithrombin.

00:34:47,982 --> 00:34:48,983
It's an anti-coagulant.

00:34:48,983 --> 00:34:50,985
And without it, I'm...

00:34:50,985 --> 00:34:53,587
in constant danger
of blood clots.

00:34:53,587 --> 00:34:54,955
Which can cause a
pulmonary embolism.

00:34:57,024 --> 00:35:00,027
So, Justin was using a Bixton
drug formula to help you.

00:35:00,027 --> 00:35:03,698
It uses goat milk to make
the antithrombin protein.

00:35:03,698 --> 00:35:07,134
It's why Justin took the job
with Bixton in the first place.

00:35:07,134 --> 00:35:08,469
To steal the recipe?

00:35:08,469 --> 00:35:10,771
Yes.

00:35:10,771 --> 00:35:13,474
The drug's called "Btryn."

00:35:13,474 --> 00:35:17,478
It was canceled during
clinical trials three years ago.

00:35:17,478 --> 00:35:19,480
Company deemed it
too expensive.

00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:22,149
My disease
is extremely rare,

00:35:22,149 --> 00:35:25,853
so there wouldn't
have been enough customers.

00:35:25,853 --> 00:35:28,622
Yeah, those pharmaceutical
giants have their bills to pay.

00:35:28,622 --> 00:35:32,026
So, Justin started
making the drug himself.

00:35:32,026 --> 00:35:34,662
But he needed
the money to do it.

00:35:34,662 --> 00:35:37,832
That's where Heather came in.

00:35:37,832 --> 00:35:41,736
It was her crazy idea
to set up the lab.

00:35:41,736 --> 00:35:43,037
Was the Btryn working?

00:35:43,037 --> 00:35:45,005
I've been on it
for about a month now.

00:35:45,005 --> 00:35:46,574
Justin was right.

00:35:46,574 --> 00:35:49,577
It's-it's actually helped
stabilize me.

00:35:49,577 --> 00:35:53,881
I never knew
that he was making meth.

00:35:53,881 --> 00:35:56,851
I only found out about it
a couple days ago.

00:35:56,851 --> 00:35:59,153
You know, I don't get why
you destroyed the lab.

00:35:59,153 --> 00:36:01,188
I mean, it was your one
chance to get the medicine.

00:36:01,188 --> 00:36:03,090
I... I didn't destroy it.

00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:04,992
I went to get my last dose.

00:36:12,767 --> 00:36:14,969
If Mary Wade's
telling the truth...

00:36:14,969 --> 00:36:19,173
and she isn't the one
that trashed this place...

00:36:19,173 --> 00:36:20,908
Then who did?

00:36:20,908 --> 00:36:22,510
All this...

00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:24,845
destruction, this rage.

00:36:24,845 --> 00:36:26,180
This is personal.

00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,715
Yeah, I think
I got something here.

00:36:41,128 --> 00:36:43,531

00:37:03,751 --> 00:37:05,119
Russell?

00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:08,622
I got DNA on the blood
from the meth lab sink.

00:37:08,622 --> 00:37:11,058
You are <i>not</i> gonna believe

Come on, Sheila.

Exhale the weakness.

I'm sorry?

00:37:31,812 --> 00:37:33,214
Can you give us a second?

00:37:33,214 --> 00:37:35,883
I wanted to talk to Alan
about the blood he left

00:37:35,883 --> 00:37:38,252
in the meth lab.

00:37:39,553 --> 00:37:40,921
Because you did.

00:37:40,921 --> 00:37:42,256
When you broke in.

00:37:42,256 --> 00:37:45,526
Force of entry more
than force of mind.

00:37:45,526 --> 00:37:47,862
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

00:37:47,862 --> 00:37:50,264
Did you teach Mary your
breathing exercises?

00:37:50,264 --> 00:37:52,933
And... did you know
she was sick?

00:37:52,933 --> 00:37:55,502
I wouldn't--
Because we checked
your credit cards.

00:37:55,502 --> 00:37:59,106
You've been shipping her
cases of that Spirit Force

00:37:59,106 --> 00:38:00,241
drink of yours.
You do that

00:38:00,241 --> 00:38:02,710
for all your clients, Alan?

00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:05,246
I'm trying to help Mary.
Well, of course
you are.

00:38:05,246 --> 00:38:07,815
I mean, good heavens, you're
in love with her, right?

00:38:09,216 --> 00:38:12,586
Mary's a very special...
very brave woman.

00:38:12,586 --> 00:38:14,755
Yeah, she is.
But you didn't
answer my question.

00:38:17,591 --> 00:38:18,993
You know,
I came from nothing.

00:38:18,993 --> 00:38:21,862
Built an empire.

00:38:21,862 --> 00:38:24,732
Truth is, I never found
anyone who interested me.

00:38:24,732 --> 00:38:27,101
Until Mary.

00:38:27,101 --> 00:38:30,871
When you find
your other half,

00:38:30,871 --> 00:38:32,673
that...

00:38:32,673 --> 00:38:35,542
is what it's
really like to fly.

00:38:37,611 --> 00:38:41,148
Have you found
your other half?

00:38:41,148 --> 00:38:43,150
Wow.
That's so romantic.

00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:45,719
The truth is, she
didn't want to fly
with you, did she?

00:38:45,719 --> 00:38:47,655
I mean, she didn't
want to have anything
to do with you, Alan.

00:38:47,655 --> 00:38:49,156
And you know why?

00:38:49,156 --> 00:38:50,958
Because her husband
already found a cure for her.

00:38:50,958 --> 00:38:53,093
Something that actually worked.

00:38:53,093 --> 00:38:54,094
Is that what happened?

00:38:54,094 --> 00:38:55,963
Hmm?

00:38:55,963 --> 00:38:58,198
You found out that
his worked, yours didn't?

00:38:58,198 --> 00:39:01,602
Is that why you
destroyed his lab?

00:39:01,602 --> 00:39:02,736
Well, come on, man.

00:39:02,736 --> 00:39:05,706
Usually you have
all the answers.

00:39:05,706 --> 00:39:07,675
You know something?

00:39:07,675 --> 00:39:09,476
I've seen people
like you before.

00:39:09,476 --> 00:39:11,512
And you
make me sick.

00:39:11,512 --> 00:39:15,649
You sell snake oil
to the weak.

00:39:15,649 --> 00:39:19,053
So you think Justin Wade
was so good?

00:39:19,053 --> 00:39:20,487
He was poisoning her.

00:39:20,487 --> 00:39:22,957
I wasn't gonna
watch her die.

00:39:22,957 --> 00:39:23,891
(scoffs)

00:39:26,627 --> 00:39:29,096
Modern medicine?

00:39:29,096 --> 00:39:31,065
That's the real snake oil here.

00:39:31,065 --> 00:39:33,200
They spend millions

00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,737
conning people into
buying chemicals and pills,

00:39:36,737 --> 00:39:39,006
so they can make billions.

00:39:39,006 --> 00:39:41,141
(scoffs) The weak?

00:39:41,141 --> 00:39:42,977
I...

00:39:42,977 --> 00:39:46,513
I make people strong.

00:39:46,513 --> 00:39:49,783
Justin Wade, he didn't
understand that.

00:39:49,783 --> 00:39:51,585
And he didn't
understand Mary.

00:39:51,585 --> 00:39:52,786
I do.

00:39:52,786 --> 00:39:54,955
You killed him, didn't you?

00:39:59,994 --> 00:40:01,662
You're damn right I did.

00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:05,899
<i>Whatever it took</i>
<i>to save Mary's life.</i>

00:40:09,036 --> 00:40:12,473
<i>To heal her; to make her fly.</i>

00:40:12,473 --> 00:40:14,942
And I'd do it again.

00:40:18,712 --> 00:40:20,014
Thank you.

00:40:20,014 --> 00:40:21,048

ELISABETTA:
<i>David,</i>

00:40:28,689 --> 00:40:30,557
everything is okay?

00:40:30,557 --> 00:40:33,060
Are you still upset
because I didn't tell
you about my past?

00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,695
No, no, it has nothing
to do with that.

00:40:34,695 --> 00:40:38,132
I don't care that you
were married for a week.

00:40:38,132 --> 00:40:40,934
Because...

00:40:40,934 --> 00:40:43,904
I want to marry you.

00:40:43,904 --> 00:40:46,507
For...forever.

00:40:46,507 --> 00:40:49,476
Then why are you
running from me?

00:40:51,812 --> 00:40:52,880
'Cause I'm an idiot.

00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,816
And I'm afraid.
Of what?

00:40:55,816 --> 00:40:56,884
Me?

00:40:56,884 --> 00:40:59,887
My family?
No, no. Um...

00:40:59,887 --> 00:41:02,122
Having a family.

00:41:03,657 --> 00:41:05,159
My father...

00:41:05,159 --> 00:41:07,261
wasn't around very
much when I grew up

00:41:07,261 --> 00:41:10,130
and when he was around,
he-he really wasn't.

00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:11,532
He was a scientist.

00:41:11,532 --> 00:41:13,567
He was always holed up
in the basement.

00:41:13,567 --> 00:41:15,069
You're afraid
you will turn into him?

00:41:15,069 --> 00:41:17,538
Terrified.
David...

00:41:17,538 --> 00:41:21,108
you fear things
that have never happened.

00:41:21,108 --> 00:41:22,976
Don't you think
it's a waste of time?

00:41:22,976 --> 00:41:26,713
Not if I'm wasting
it with you.

00:41:31,785 --> 00:41:33,487
Hey.

00:41:33,487 --> 00:41:36,690
I, uh, have your
husband's wedding ring.

00:41:36,690 --> 00:41:37,858
Thanks.

00:41:37,858 --> 00:41:39,560
Blood test confirmed
your illness.

00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:42,096
I hope someday there's a
drug that will help you.

00:41:51,538 --> 00:41:52,840
Have you ever...

00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:56,710
flown in your dreams?

00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:59,880
Ever since Justin died
I'm so numb all day,

00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,815
but when I sleep...

00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:06,053
<i>I'm healthy, I'm free and...</i>

00:42:08,122 --> 00:42:10,657
<i>...I fly.</i>

00:42:11,959 --> 00:42:14,795
<i>And he's with me somehow.</i>

00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:20,634
And then I wake and...
I'm alone

00:42:20,634 --> 00:42:22,836
but I'm...
I'm not as sad.

00:42:22,836 --> 00:42:26,106
Because I can
still feel his presence.

00:42:26,106 --> 00:42:28,709
You two must've loved
each other very much.

00:42:28,709 --> 00:42:30,511
I'm sorry.

00:42:30,511 --> 00:42:32,880
Maybe someday, there'll be
a drug that can save me.

00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,181
Maybe not.

00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:43,190
All I know is when I remember
all the good that we had...

00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:44,591
I'm fearless.
