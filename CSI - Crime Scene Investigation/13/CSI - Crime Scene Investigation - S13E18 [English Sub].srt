00:00:02,402 --> 00:00:03,970
(panting)

00:00:06,374 --> 00:00:07,709
Leave me alone!

00:00:10,278 --> 00:00:12,247
Stay away!

00:00:12,247 --> 00:00:14,783
(grunts)

00:00:14,783 --> 00:00:16,818
(filtered breathing)

00:00:33,668 --> 00:00:34,836
(twig snaps)

00:00:38,006 --> 00:00:39,007
(loud crunch)

00:00:39,007 --> 00:00:40,341
(screaming)

00:00:40,341 --> 00:00:42,377
(scream fading, echoing)

00:00:42,377 --> 00:00:46,247
(siren wailing in distance,
indistinct radio chatter)

00:00:46,247 --> 00:00:48,216
Homeless couple
was camped there with the group

00:00:48,216 --> 00:00:50,652
under the overpass,
spotted the body

00:00:50,652 --> 00:00:52,153
and flagged down a patrol unit.

00:00:52,153 --> 00:00:53,655
David.

00:00:53,655 --> 00:00:55,290
Hey.
Well, looks like
somebody beat you

00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:56,791
to the burrito
wrap here.

00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:58,793
I would've done
a better job, though.

00:01:00,028 --> 00:01:01,362
BRODY:
Camouflage.

00:01:01,362 --> 00:01:03,231
Says, maybe, military.

00:01:03,231 --> 00:01:06,167
Yeah, or army surplus--
you know, camping stuff.

00:01:08,136 --> 00:01:11,072
STOKES: It reminds me
of when I used to go hunting

00:01:11,072 --> 00:01:12,640
with my old man.

00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,842
I never pegged you as a hunter.

00:01:13,842 --> 00:01:15,276
Of course I was a hunter.

00:01:15,276 --> 00:01:16,978
Just never got
into the killing part.

00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,783
Apparently, someone doesn't
have the same reverence

00:01:21,783 --> 00:01:23,685
for life as you do.

00:01:23,685 --> 00:01:25,353
Massive bruising on the face.

00:01:25,353 --> 00:01:26,888
He took
a real beating.

00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:32,260
Yeah, and that looks like some
kind of animal bite on his leg.

00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,896
Vital response
in the tissue

00:01:34,896 --> 00:01:36,831
means it happened
while he was still alive.

00:01:37,966 --> 00:01:39,033
A wolf or...

00:01:39,033 --> 00:01:41,402
a coyote,
some kind of dog.

00:01:41,402 --> 00:01:43,938
But I think dogs were the least
of this guy's worries.

00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:45,740
Somebody took his hands.

00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,308
Well, a dog didn't do that.

00:01:47,308 --> 00:01:50,111
No wallet, no I.D.

00:01:50,111 --> 00:01:51,813
No hands, no fingerprints.

00:01:51,813 --> 00:01:53,882
Well, then again,
if we're talking about hunting,

00:01:53,882 --> 00:01:56,651
maybe the killer took the hands
as a trophy.

00:01:56,651 --> 00:01:57,886
BRODY:
Either way,

00:01:57,886 --> 00:01:59,153
we have no I.D.,

00:01:59,153 --> 00:02:00,288
and we have no idea

00:02:00,288 --> 00:02:01,356
where this guy
came from.

00:02:01,356 --> 00:02:04,259
We're stumped.

00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:06,828
Sorry. I'm just saying,
this is gonna be a tough one.

00:02:08,062 --> 00:02:10,265
They always are,
Super Dave.

00:02:10,265 --> 00:02:12,400

This a traffic camera?

00:02:50,238 --> 00:02:51,906
On Sunrise Boulevard.

00:02:51,906 --> 00:02:54,142
Got a detail of the
drainage basin, blew it up.

00:02:54,142 --> 00:02:56,344
Picked up an image
of this guy dumping our victim.

00:02:56,344 --> 00:02:57,345

00:02:57,345 --> 00:02:58,913

It's about five
hours ago.

00:03:00,882 --> 00:03:03,184
Well, maybe our killer
will show his face.

00:03:03,184 --> 00:03:04,953
Freeze that,
right there.

00:03:04,953 --> 00:03:07,956
I can enhance it.

00:03:07,956 --> 00:03:10,959
(beeping)

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,160
Night vision goggles?

00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,828
That's some serious hardware.

00:03:13,828 --> 00:03:15,964
Nick thought that our guy
was a hunter.

00:03:15,964 --> 00:03:17,966
Who's hunting humans?

00:03:17,966 --> 00:03:21,302
Man is the most dangerous game.

00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:34,048
He has a knee brace.
Must have had an old injury.

00:03:34,048 --> 00:03:36,084
SANDERS:
Vonner Sports Motocross.

00:03:36,084 --> 00:03:37,885
You know, a lot of this gear
is custom-made.

00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:40,088
Might be able to get an
I.D. from the manufacturer.

00:03:40,088 --> 00:03:42,790
There's something
in his little pocket.

00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:44,859
Looks like
a wad of paper.

00:03:46,694 --> 00:03:48,129
Maybe it's something more.

00:03:50,031 --> 00:03:51,766
Huh.

00:03:54,135 --> 00:03:55,703
Paper crane.

00:03:55,703 --> 00:03:57,739
You think our victim
was into origami?

00:03:57,739 --> 00:03:59,974
Or our killer was trying
to leave us a clue.

00:03:59,974 --> 00:04:01,909
How about you
chase the crane,

00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:04,412
and I'll get our John Doe
to Doc Robbins.

00:04:06,748 --> 00:04:08,383
C.O.D.'s exsanguination

00:04:08,383 --> 00:04:10,218
due to bisection
of the right wrist,

00:04:10,218 --> 00:04:12,854
rupturing the radial
and ulnar arteries.

00:04:12,854 --> 00:04:14,922
The right hand was severed
peri-mortem?

00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:16,424
That's correct.

00:04:16,424 --> 00:04:18,259
Well, we assumed both hands
were removed postmortem

00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:21,829
to prevent identification
or possibly taken as trophies.

00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:23,698
Well, that's the case
with the left hand.

00:04:23,698 --> 00:04:25,433
The injury here is
definitely postmortem.

00:04:25,433 --> 00:04:27,735
In both instances,
the method was crude.

00:04:27,735 --> 00:04:29,670
I can't tell you
what tool was used,

00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,939
but I sent swabs from the wounds
over to Hodges.

00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:33,708
What about the animal
bite on his leg?

00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:34,842
It was no animal.

00:04:34,842 --> 00:04:36,878
It was man-made.
Come on over here.

00:04:39,313 --> 00:04:40,815
Perfect symmetry

00:04:40,815 --> 00:04:43,051
of the punctures was the tell.

00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,122
GREG:
A bear trap?

00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:49,857
Well, it's consistent
with our theory

00:04:49,857 --> 00:04:51,726
that the killer
may be a hunter.

00:04:51,726 --> 00:04:54,295
I also found this
in the postmortem wound.

00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:57,298
Appears to be some
kind of synthetic.

00:04:57,298 --> 00:04:59,767
Could help us
find our primary.

00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:00,902
I'll get it to Hodges.

00:05:00,902 --> 00:05:02,737
Thanks, Doc.

00:05:50,318 --> 00:05:51,786
Hey.

00:05:51,786 --> 00:05:53,321
I see your artist
remains anonymous.

00:05:53,321 --> 00:05:54,689
(sighs):
Yeah.

00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:56,424
I didn't fare
much better myself.

00:05:56,424 --> 00:05:58,826
The green sliver
Doc found on the body

00:05:58,826 --> 00:06:01,362
is a polypropylene blend
with green dye.

00:06:01,362 --> 00:06:03,131
Artificial turf.
Indeed.

00:06:03,131 --> 00:06:04,732
And I didn't find

00:06:04,732 --> 00:06:06,934
any trace that put us
closer to the primary.

00:06:06,934 --> 00:06:09,003
(sighs) So we
both struck out.
Mm.

00:06:10,104 --> 00:06:11,739
You know,

00:06:11,739 --> 00:06:14,175
I dated a Japanese girl
in college.

00:06:14,175 --> 00:06:16,310
<i>Washi</i> is the paper
traditionally used

00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,745
by the masters.

00:06:17,745 --> 00:06:19,247
Tougher than
ordinary pulped paper,

00:06:19,247 --> 00:06:20,648
it's often made
from the bark

00:06:20,648 --> 00:06:23,184
of the <i>gampi</i> tree,
or sometimes

00:06:23,184 --> 00:06:25,086
from the mitsumata shrub...
Hodges.

00:06:25,086 --> 00:06:27,688
All I'm saying is

00:06:27,688 --> 00:06:31,292
in origami, sometimes
the medium is the message.

00:06:31,292 --> 00:06:34,262
As in, that is not
proper origami paper.

00:06:34,262 --> 00:06:36,097
Our crane may not
be speaking to us,

00:06:36,097 --> 00:06:37,765
but the paper might.

00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:42,303
Okay, thanks
for the info.

00:06:42,303 --> 00:06:43,404
Hey.

00:06:43,404 --> 00:06:45,039
Hey. Get up there
and lay down, boy.

00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,974
Is it
"bring your dog to work" day?

00:06:46,974 --> 00:06:48,709
We were just coming home
from the vet.

00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:50,945
I thought I'd bring him up here
to see some friends,

00:06:50,945 --> 00:06:52,346
maybe cheer him up a little bit.

00:06:52,346 --> 00:06:54,815
(Sam whines)
I bet you Sam's bored.

00:06:54,815 --> 00:06:56,817
Are you kidding me?
This dog's living the life.

00:06:56,817 --> 00:06:58,352
I treat him like a king.
(chuckles): Nick,

00:06:58,352 --> 00:07:00,922
he used to be a cop;
now he's retired.

00:07:00,922 --> 00:07:03,257
He probably misses the field.

00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:05,226
Is she right, Sam?

00:07:05,226 --> 00:07:07,962
You bored? You want to do
some work? <i>Travaillez?</i>

00:07:07,962 --> 00:07:09,130
(barking)

00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:10,831
Told you.

00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:14,268
Speaking of getting to work,
that custom knee brace

00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:17,004
that Greg found on our
victim-- manufacturer said

00:07:17,004 --> 00:07:19,140
it was ordered by a Dylan Trigg.

00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,775
Summerlin address.

00:07:20,775 --> 00:07:22,810
Sounds like we just I.D.'d
our John Doe.

00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,278
I'm heading out there now
with Crawford

00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:26,747
to give notification.

00:07:26,747 --> 00:07:29,250
We don't envy you that,

00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:45,166
Yeah, excuse me, sir.

00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:47,768
I'm Detective Crawford,
this is CSI Brody, LVPD.

00:07:47,768 --> 00:07:49,337
My crazy neighbor
call you guys again?

00:07:49,337 --> 00:07:51,739
I'm sorry, I
don't understand.
My pickup.

00:07:51,739 --> 00:07:53,808
Guy keeps complaining
that I park it on the street.

00:07:53,808 --> 00:07:55,376
So I park in front
of his house--

00:07:55,376 --> 00:07:57,178
what's the big deal?
It's a public street.

00:07:57,178 --> 00:07:59,013
Nobody called
about your truck, sir.

00:07:59,013 --> 00:08:01,682
Um, does a Dylan Trigg
live here?

00:08:01,682 --> 00:08:04,952
Yeah. Dylan's my son.

00:08:06,821 --> 00:08:08,089
What's this about?

00:08:08,089 --> 00:08:09,890
Mr. Trigg, when's
the last time

00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,292
you saw your son?

00:08:11,292 --> 00:08:13,127
Five minutes ago.

00:08:13,127 --> 00:08:16,664
Hey, Dylan,
can you come out here?

00:08:16,664 --> 00:08:19,033
You say your friend's
name is Carl Abrams?

00:08:19,033 --> 00:08:20,434
Yeah, I loaned Carl

00:08:20,434 --> 00:08:22,970
some of my motocross gear
a couple days ago.

00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,338
Uh, this is us

00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:27,942
at the freestyle competition
in Laughlin last year.

00:08:27,942 --> 00:08:29,810
That's where he dinged
his knee.

00:08:32,747 --> 00:08:37,385
You said somebody...
killed Carl.

00:08:37,385 --> 00:08:40,288
(sighs) I mean, I-I don't
understand. What happened?

00:08:40,288 --> 00:08:42,156
That's what we're trying
to figure out.

00:08:42,156 --> 00:08:44,892
Did it go down
up near Koval Ridge?

00:08:44,892 --> 00:08:46,427
Why do you ask that?

00:08:46,427 --> 00:08:49,664
We were supposed to go camping
there this weekend.

00:08:49,664 --> 00:08:51,299
But I bailed at the last minute.

00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:53,034
And why didn't you go?

00:08:53,034 --> 00:08:55,803
There's something
about that place, man.

00:08:55,803 --> 00:08:57,104
Creeps me out.

00:08:57,104 --> 00:08:58,939
What about it?
There's this whole

00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:01,108
<i>Hunger Games, Road Warrior</i>
vibe up there.

00:09:01,108 --> 00:09:02,677
All these people waiting

00:09:02,677 --> 00:09:04,412
for the world to end--
it's kind of scary.

00:09:04,412 --> 00:09:06,180
Carl loved the place.

00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,848
He camped there
by himself.

00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:09,984
Loved exploring
around the old mines.

00:09:09,984 --> 00:09:12,286
He told me he'd
strike it rich one day.

00:09:12,286 --> 00:09:13,688
Do you know any spots

00:09:13,688 --> 00:09:15,656
maybe your buddy
liked to camp in?

00:09:15,656 --> 00:09:17,191
If I was gonna go
looking for him,

00:09:17,191 --> 00:09:20,795
I'd probably look in the areas
around those old mines.

00:09:20,795 --> 00:09:22,229
Sorry, I-I wish
I knew more.

00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:25,032
Maybe if... if I had
been up there with him,

00:09:25,032 --> 00:09:26,801
this wouldn't have happened.

00:09:39,747 --> 00:09:42,149
Hey, Crawford, you there?

00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:43,718
CRAWFORD:
Copy.

00:09:43,718 --> 00:09:45,419
All right, listen,
we're about a mile

00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:46,921
from Pielstick mine.

00:09:46,921 --> 00:09:48,155
We're gonna
start our search

00:09:48,155 --> 00:09:49,924
with the dog
over here, okay?

00:09:49,924 --> 00:09:51,692
Copy that. We're on
the south side of the ridge.

00:09:51,692 --> 00:09:53,094
Haven't found anything yet.

00:09:53,094 --> 00:09:54,228

00:09:54,228 --> 00:09:56,364
Roger that.

00:09:56,364 --> 00:09:57,832

All right, we're gonna

00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:02,870
find out where
Carl Abrams came from.

00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:05,072
This is a swatch from
the victim's shirt.

00:10:05,072 --> 00:10:06,240

00:10:41,909 --> 00:10:43,911
Hang on, I think
he's got something.

00:10:43,911 --> 00:10:45,212
Hang on.

00:10:45,212 --> 00:10:46,714

You might want to go topside;
I don't think

00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:27,081
you're gonna get
a signal down here.

00:12:27,081 --> 00:12:28,716
I'll be back.

I don't care
who the hell you are.

00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:48,896
You're trespassing.

00:13:48,896 --> 00:13:50,264
And you're making a big mistake.

00:13:50,264 --> 00:13:51,832
There's a whole lot
of cops up there.

00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:53,667
Gonna be coming
through that door any second.

00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:54,768
You think I'm stupid, pal?

00:13:54,768 --> 00:13:56,036
You think I was born yesterday?

00:13:56,036 --> 00:13:57,871
Nope.

00:13:57,871 --> 00:14:00,674

Put that shotgun down,
and we'll talk about it.

Otherwise,
they're gonna be

00:14:08,148 --> 00:14:09,283
scraping us both
up off the ground.

00:14:09,283 --> 00:14:10,718
Is that what
you want?

00:14:10,718 --> 00:14:11,852
You're here to arrest me?

00:14:11,852 --> 00:14:13,387
We want to talk to you.

00:14:13,387 --> 00:14:15,055
(Sam barking)

00:14:24,999 --> 00:14:27,134
Guess I should have had them
scrape us up off the floor.

00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:30,938
Better than sitting here
like a common criminal.

00:14:30,938 --> 00:14:33,207
Well, that part's still
to be determined, actually.

00:14:33,207 --> 00:14:34,375
Who are you?

00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:35,376
I'm CSI Russell.

00:14:35,376 --> 00:14:37,111
Care to tell us who you are?

00:14:39,346 --> 00:14:41,949
A lot of people are living
off the grid nowadays,

00:14:41,949 --> 00:14:44,284
but y-you've taken it
to a whole new level.

00:14:44,284 --> 00:14:46,854
You-you have no identification.

00:14:46,854 --> 00:14:49,289
So far, we've found nothing
in your little bunker.

00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:51,358
No bank statement,

00:14:51,358 --> 00:14:53,160
no utility bills,
nothing with your name on it.

00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,428
It's almost like
you worked

00:14:54,428 --> 00:14:56,163
very hard to disappear,
haven't you?

00:14:56,163 --> 00:14:57,264
Is that a crime?

00:14:57,264 --> 00:14:58,365
Well, I'm just wondering why.

00:14:58,365 --> 00:15:01,235
Why?

00:15:01,235 --> 00:15:03,971
You had no right to
drag me out of my home.

00:15:03,971 --> 00:15:05,773
Without as
much as a word

00:15:05,773 --> 00:15:06,974
as to why.

00:15:06,974 --> 00:15:08,709
You know why.

00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:11,812
I've seen the way
you treat trespassers.

00:15:11,812 --> 00:15:13,414
You're not very hospitable.

00:15:13,414 --> 00:15:15,349
Is that what happened
with Carl Abrams?

00:15:15,349 --> 00:15:16,684
He trespass?

00:15:17,985 --> 00:15:20,854
I don't know Carl Abrams.

00:15:20,854 --> 00:15:22,322
Okay.

00:15:22,322 --> 00:15:24,091
That's fine if you
don't want to cooperate.

00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:26,727
We'll let your little
hole in the ground

00:15:26,727 --> 00:15:28,429
do the talking.

00:15:37,871 --> 00:15:39,206
Who does this?

00:15:40,741 --> 00:15:42,976
(sighs)
Someone prepping for doomsday.

00:15:42,976 --> 00:15:44,878
Re-creating a world they believe

00:15:44,878 --> 00:15:46,947
will disappear with
the coming Armageddon.

00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:48,882
Tried to make
something disappear.

00:15:48,882 --> 00:15:50,718
Blood.

00:15:50,718 --> 00:15:52,286
Lots of it.

00:15:52,286 --> 00:15:54,388
Astroturf is porous,
just like carpet.

00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,062
That's a significant blood pool.

00:16:02,062 --> 00:16:04,364
The killer severed
Carl Abrams' right hand.

00:16:04,364 --> 00:16:05,766
He bled out.

00:16:05,766 --> 00:16:08,268
Could've been right here.

00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:13,407
Doc Robbins found
something like this

00:16:13,407 --> 00:16:14,842
in the victim's
wound track.

00:16:16,777 --> 00:16:18,912
Positive for blood.

00:16:18,912 --> 00:16:20,781
Carl Abrams died here.

00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:27,755
Place is lacking a certain
survivalist touch.

00:16:27,755 --> 00:16:30,157
Yeah, it doesn't really fit
our man with no name, does it?

00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:31,859
How long do you
think the guy's

00:16:31,859 --> 00:16:33,427
been living down
here like this?

00:16:33,427 --> 00:16:36,930
Well, he's got
a well-stocked pantry,

00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:39,666
he's got water, electricity.

00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,201
I'd say for a while.

00:16:41,201 --> 00:16:43,303
You know, I'd say
we're done in this room.

00:16:43,303 --> 00:16:45,305
There's no blood,
there's no sign of disturbance,

00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:47,107
there's nothing probative
in here.

00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:49,009
All right, let's check
the rest of the house.

00:17:00,954 --> 00:17:02,790
Hey, Fin?

00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:05,726
I think I found
the master's master bedroom.

00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:13,200
This decor is more like it.

00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:41,128
I found his toys.

00:17:41,128 --> 00:17:43,430
FINLAY: Sara, you
got to see this.

00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:51,905
This is not good.

00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:53,073
Mm-mm.

00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:54,675
Man keeps a room
for a little girl

00:17:54,675 --> 00:17:55,843
in his hunting cave.

00:17:55,843 --> 00:17:57,010
Yeah, it gets worse.

00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:58,278
I don't think
he uses the room

00:17:58,278 --> 00:17:59,646
just for little girls.

00:18:02,382 --> 00:18:04,284
Women's clothes.

00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:05,686
Yeah, and different sizes.

00:18:05,686 --> 00:18:07,387
Could mean a number
of different women.

00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:09,056
Some of these labels
are old.

00:18:09,056 --> 00:18:11,191
Sutters?

00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:13,126
That department store's been
out of business for years.

00:18:18,866 --> 00:18:21,368
Origami paper crane.

00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:30,911
Just like the one I pulled
out of Carl Abrams' pocket.

00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:34,882
Do you think he makes
one for each victim?

00:18:36,383 --> 00:18:38,151
You recognize that?

00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,889
We have your prints all over it.

00:18:41,889 --> 00:18:43,223
I'll give you a hint:

00:18:43,223 --> 00:18:44,925
it's not one of
the origami animals

00:18:44,925 --> 00:18:47,427
we just found in your house,
but it looks just like it.

00:18:47,427 --> 00:18:48,428
This was in

00:18:48,428 --> 00:18:50,097
Carl Abrams' pocket

00:18:50,097 --> 00:18:52,733
when we found his body

00:18:52,733 --> 00:18:54,268
and his blood

00:18:54,268 --> 00:18:55,836
in your bunker.

00:18:55,836 --> 00:18:57,838
I told you,
I don't know the guy.

00:18:57,838 --> 00:18:59,907
You're setting me up.
You need a suspect.

00:18:59,907 --> 00:19:02,276
And for whatever reason,
you've chosen me.

00:19:02,276 --> 00:19:04,645
Yeah, actually, you know what?
Y-You reached out to us.

00:19:04,645 --> 00:19:06,146
Here, take a look at that video.

00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:08,081
See, you made the first move,
didn't you?

00:19:08,081 --> 00:19:10,017
Look, I know how this works.

00:19:10,017 --> 00:19:11,184
Yeah, I'll bet you do.

00:19:11,184 --> 00:19:12,386
That's it.

00:19:12,386 --> 00:19:13,887
I've had enough
of this pervert.

00:19:16,023 --> 00:19:19,726
Why don't you tell us about
the little girl's room

00:19:19,726 --> 00:19:22,195
you have set
up down there.

00:19:22,195 --> 00:19:24,097
And all the clothes
from all those women.

00:19:24,097 --> 00:19:25,098
I mean,

00:19:25,098 --> 00:19:26,900
how many were there?

00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,435
You want me to admit
to something that I didn't do.

00:19:28,435 --> 00:19:29,903
Something that I have
no knowledge of.

00:19:29,903 --> 00:19:31,071
Well, I'm not playing your game!

00:19:31,071 --> 00:19:32,406
All I want

00:19:32,406 --> 00:19:34,141
is to be left
in peace.
Is that what

00:19:34,141 --> 00:19:36,343
you told Carl Abrams
before you killed him?

00:19:36,343 --> 00:19:37,778
I don't know Carl.

00:19:37,778 --> 00:19:39,146
He was camping
in your area.

00:19:39,146 --> 00:19:40,147
What happened?

00:19:40,147 --> 00:19:41,648
Did he stumble

00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:42,816
upon your little piece

00:19:42,816 --> 00:19:45,118
of hell down there?

00:19:54,728 --> 00:19:56,930
Got signs of sexual activity.

00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:58,332
Not that
I'm surprised.

00:19:58,332 --> 00:19:59,933
Well, I'm surprised.

00:19:59,933 --> 00:20:02,736
There is <i>no</i> blood here.

00:20:02,736 --> 00:20:05,772
Well, a sex room isn't
the same as a kill room.

00:20:05,772 --> 00:20:07,140
He takes them somewhere else.

00:20:14,181 --> 00:20:16,883
(thumping)

00:20:18,085 --> 00:20:19,219
Did you hear that?

00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:20,954
Yeah.

00:20:20,954 --> 00:20:23,757
Sounds like it's coming
from behind the wall.

00:20:23,757 --> 00:20:24,958
Looks like an air vent.

00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:26,360
(thumping continues)

00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,794
There's no air coming out.

00:20:29,296 --> 00:20:32,065
Whatever it is,
it's inside the walls.

00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:33,900
It's moving.

00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,402
It's headed towards the yard.

00:20:35,402 --> 00:20:37,938
It's trying to get away.

00:20:39,206 --> 00:20:40,407
Stop. Hold on.

00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:41,975
Stop right there!
Wait, wait!

00:20:41,975 --> 00:20:43,176
(panting)

00:20:43,176 --> 00:20:44,177
Stop.
It's okay.

00:20:44,177 --> 00:20:45,812
Stop. We're the police.

00:20:45,812 --> 00:20:47,314
No one's gonna
hurt you.

00:20:47,314 --> 00:20:48,415
We're here to
help you, okay?

00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:51,051
What's your name?

00:20:51,051 --> 00:20:52,319
We're gonna get
you out of here.

00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:53,920
You're safe now.

00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,288
You're okay.

00:20:55,288 --> 00:20:58,191
You're safe.

00:20:58,191 --> 00:21:00,127
♪ ♪

00:21:28,321 --> 00:21:30,257
♪ ♪

00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:48,208
We may not know your
name, but we're starting

00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:50,410
to get a pretty good
picture of your crimes.

00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:51,878
We found the girl.

00:21:51,878 --> 00:21:53,980
One you've been
holding captive.

00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,148
The one you kidnapped.

00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:56,750
And raped.

00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,885
And probably
would've murdered,

00:21:58,885 --> 00:22:00,420
just like all the others.

00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,689
Remember how we asked you
how many women there were?

00:22:02,689 --> 00:22:04,391
Well, we've already found one.

00:22:04,391 --> 00:22:06,893
Rebecca Barnes.

00:22:06,893 --> 00:22:08,128
Recognize her?

00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:13,066
Or have there just been so many,
you can't even remember

00:22:13,066 --> 00:22:14,334
at this point?

00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:17,270
Found her dress
in your bunker.

00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:20,107
The DNA on it traces
to an unsolved murder

00:22:20,107 --> 00:22:21,808
in Carson City 11 years ago.

00:22:23,844 --> 00:22:25,112
Was she your first?

00:22:25,112 --> 00:22:27,848
Is that why you
kept the dress?

00:22:27,848 --> 00:22:29,382
As a trophy?

00:22:29,382 --> 00:22:31,818
You people have no idea
what you're talking about.

00:22:31,818 --> 00:22:33,386
Then you tell us!

00:22:33,386 --> 00:22:35,856
What drives a man

00:22:35,856 --> 00:22:39,392
to kidnap, to rape,
and to murder?

00:22:39,392 --> 00:22:41,728
I wouldn't know.

00:22:41,728 --> 00:22:45,398
This woman that you said that
I murdered, Rebecca Barnes--

00:22:45,398 --> 00:22:47,701
she was my wife.

00:22:47,701 --> 00:22:50,370
And the girl that you found--

00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,239
the one you accused me of...

00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,644
Her name...

00:22:57,644 --> 00:22:59,779
it's Miranda.

00:22:59,779 --> 00:23:01,248
And that's my little girl.

00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,385
She's all I have left
in this world.

00:23:24,371 --> 00:23:26,373
Just got the file on
the Rebecca Barnes

00:23:26,373 --> 00:23:27,974
homicide from
Carson City.

00:23:27,974 --> 00:23:29,276
Bunker Boy's name

00:23:29,276 --> 00:23:30,644
is Tommy Barnes.

00:23:30,644 --> 00:23:32,279
He was the husband
and primary suspect

00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:35,248
in his wife's murder until
Carson City cleared him.

00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:36,783
That explains the attitude.

00:23:36,783 --> 00:23:38,418
He thought the cops were
coming after him again.

00:23:38,418 --> 00:23:40,220
Says here they never
caught the killer?

00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:42,055
Yeah, still
an open case.

00:23:42,055 --> 00:23:44,724
Barnes's daughter Miranda was
seven years old at the time.

00:23:44,724 --> 00:23:46,293
After he was cleared,
he told police

00:23:46,293 --> 00:23:48,395
he was taking his daughter
and leaving town.

00:23:48,395 --> 00:23:50,163
Then went underground,
literally.

00:23:50,163 --> 00:23:51,998
DNA confirms the
only contributors

00:23:51,998 --> 00:23:54,334
on the women's clothes are
his wife and his daughter.

00:23:54,334 --> 00:23:56,436
Different sizes.

00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:58,071
He kept his wife's dresses,

00:23:58,071 --> 00:24:01,007
then he bought his kid new
clothes as she was growing up.

00:24:01,007 --> 00:24:02,976
Sad story,
but none of that

00:24:02,976 --> 00:24:06,713
clears him on the
murder of Carl Abrams.

00:24:06,713 --> 00:24:08,782
No. No, it doesn't.

00:24:11,851 --> 00:24:13,186
Where's my daughter?

00:24:13,186 --> 00:24:14,754
I want to see her.

00:24:14,754 --> 00:24:16,056
She's fine.

00:24:16,056 --> 00:24:19,192
She's in the hospital,
getting checked out.

00:24:19,192 --> 00:24:21,962
It's just a...

00:24:21,962 --> 00:24:24,731
It's a formality.

00:24:24,731 --> 00:24:26,166
I'm gonna, uh, take

00:24:26,166 --> 00:24:28,268
your cuffs off here.

00:24:33,073 --> 00:24:34,407
Mr. Barnes...

00:24:36,743 --> 00:24:39,112
...why don't you and I
start over again.

00:24:39,112 --> 00:24:41,114
With an apology.

00:24:42,782 --> 00:24:46,086
I was just told
about Carson City.

00:24:46,086 --> 00:24:49,889
I can't even begin
to know what that was like.

00:24:49,889 --> 00:24:51,258
Losing your wife,

00:24:51,258 --> 00:24:53,193
having the police
suspect you like that.

00:24:53,193 --> 00:24:55,428
For months.

00:24:55,428 --> 00:24:57,664
While that animal
who killed Rebecca

00:24:57,664 --> 00:25:00,000
is still out there, free.

00:25:03,003 --> 00:25:05,071
I, um...

00:25:05,071 --> 00:25:07,040
read the case file.

00:25:09,209 --> 00:25:11,945
Your daughter Miranda was there

00:25:11,945 --> 00:25:15,081
when-when your wife was abducted
from the mall parking lot.

00:25:15,081 --> 00:25:18,652
It could have been both of them
taken away from me.

00:25:18,652 --> 00:25:20,987
Mr. Barnes, I'm so sorry.

00:25:24,658 --> 00:25:26,126
Thanks.

00:25:28,061 --> 00:25:30,096
You know, Rebecca was my
high school sweetheart.

00:25:33,333 --> 00:25:35,035
We had a perfect life.

00:25:35,035 --> 00:25:37,270
Nice house, good friends,
part of a church.

00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:39,839
You never expect
to wake up one morning,

00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:43,176
leave your home,
you go to work,

00:25:43,176 --> 00:25:46,846
the wife does some shopping--
just a normal day.

00:25:46,846 --> 00:25:49,849
When you get back home...

00:25:49,849 --> 00:25:51,851
it's all gone.

00:25:51,851 --> 00:25:55,322
And-and that's when
you-you went underground?

00:25:55,322 --> 00:25:57,824
Well, in the '50s,

00:25:57,824 --> 00:26:00,860
before my grandfather donated
the land to the state, he built

00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,729
a fallout shelter
to protect his family.

00:26:02,729 --> 00:26:04,364
And you decided
that's how you were gonna

00:26:04,364 --> 00:26:05,999
protect your family, too.

00:26:05,999 --> 00:26:08,735
What was left of it.

00:26:08,735 --> 00:26:10,670
So I built a home
in the bunker.

00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:12,972
I'd take odd jobs
in the area.

00:26:12,972 --> 00:26:15,175
I provided Miranda with
everything she needed.

00:26:15,175 --> 00:26:17,777
Food, shelter.

00:26:17,777 --> 00:26:19,946
I even homeschooled her.

00:26:19,946 --> 00:26:23,183
Well, that's a great plan
when she's seven.

00:26:23,183 --> 00:26:26,720
What about now
when she's 17?

00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,988
Miranda has everything
that she needs.

00:26:28,988 --> 00:26:32,225
You and I both know
that's not true.

00:26:32,225 --> 00:26:34,027
We found evidence

00:26:34,027 --> 00:26:35,995
of sexual activity

00:26:35,995 --> 00:26:37,263
in your daughter's bed.

00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:38,765
Two DNA contributions.

00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:40,300
Two men-- one unknown,

00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,769
the other one,
our victim, Carl Abrams.

00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:44,871
You're lying.
I know my daughter.

00:26:44,871 --> 00:26:47,407
You just told me
that you took odd jobs.

00:26:47,407 --> 00:26:48,942
That gets you out of the house.

00:26:48,942 --> 00:26:51,010
Your daughter--
she's lonely,

00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:52,879
she's curious, she ventures out.

00:26:52,879 --> 00:26:55,715
No, she would never leave
on her own, not without me.

00:26:55,715 --> 00:26:59,686
Mr. Barnes, Carl Abrams' semen
in your daughter's bed,

00:26:59,686 --> 00:27:01,121
his blood in your house.

00:27:01,121 --> 00:27:02,422
Now, come on.

00:27:02,422 --> 00:27:04,424
Look, I know
you'd do anything

00:27:04,424 --> 00:27:05,959
to protect your daughter.

00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:08,027
I just told you,
I'm not a murderer.

00:27:08,027 --> 00:27:09,863
Did he break in?
Did he threaten Miranda?

00:27:09,863 --> 00:27:11,965
You guys are all the
same, aren't you?

00:27:11,965 --> 00:27:13,800
Here, Carson City--
it's the same.

00:27:15,068 --> 00:27:17,137
I'm done talking to you.

00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:23,309
(door opens)

00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:25,979
I need to ask you
some questions.

00:27:25,979 --> 00:27:27,914
Miranda.

00:27:27,914 --> 00:27:29,983
Yes, I-I do know your name.

00:27:29,983 --> 00:27:33,653
And I know how you and your dad
ended up in that bunker.

00:27:33,653 --> 00:27:37,023
But what I don't know
is what happened

00:27:37,023 --> 00:27:40,160
to Carl Abrams
two nights ago.

00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,128
And I need you to tell me.

00:27:42,128 --> 00:27:44,264
I can't help you.

00:27:44,264 --> 00:27:46,199
Yes, you can.

00:27:46,199 --> 00:27:50,203
This is a DNA report
which tells me that there were

00:27:50,203 --> 00:27:52,806
two boys in your bed.

00:27:54,174 --> 00:27:56,643
One of whom was Carl.

00:27:56,643 --> 00:27:57,777
No, that's a lie.

00:27:57,777 --> 00:27:59,179
I've never been with any boys.

00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:01,915
What happened?

00:28:01,915 --> 00:28:04,651
Was the other boy
jealous of Carl?

00:28:04,651 --> 00:28:06,386
Did they fight?

00:28:06,386 --> 00:28:08,321
I know Carl was hurt.

00:28:08,321 --> 00:28:11,291
He went down into the bunker
to you for help.

00:28:11,291 --> 00:28:13,059
Leave me alone.

00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:14,928
Miranda,

00:28:14,928 --> 00:28:18,298
I remember being so scared
of disappointing my dad.

00:28:18,298 --> 00:28:20,166
And yet, I was

00:28:20,166 --> 00:28:23,670
so desperate for other people's
attention, I would do anything.

00:28:25,071 --> 00:28:28,374
You started sneaking out
when your dad was away,

00:28:28,374 --> 00:28:31,044
and you met Carl.

00:28:31,044 --> 00:28:33,279
And I'm sure the two of you
had a really good time.

00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,815
And then, you met another boy.

00:28:35,815 --> 00:28:39,352
And he was a bad boy,
and it was really exciting.

00:28:39,352 --> 00:28:43,223
And you didn't realize
just how dangerous that boy was

00:28:43,223 --> 00:28:45,225
until it was too late.

00:28:45,225 --> 00:28:49,162
I know you know
what happened to Carl.

00:28:49,162 --> 00:28:51,231
And I know that you're scared,

00:28:51,231 --> 00:28:53,366
and you don't know
who you're more scared of--

00:28:53,366 --> 00:28:55,802
your-your dad
or the other boy.

00:28:55,802 --> 00:28:57,670
But you don't have to be.

00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:59,806
You just have
to tell me the truth.

00:29:03,276 --> 00:29:05,144
(sighs)
I had her.

00:29:05,144 --> 00:29:07,413
She was this close
to talking, and then

00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:09,682
I lost her;
she just went right back

00:29:09,682 --> 00:29:11,284
into being
that scared little girl.

00:29:11,284 --> 00:29:12,919
Where's this leave us?

00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:14,387
What about that other kid--
the one you think

00:29:14,387 --> 00:29:16,356
that killed Carl Abrams--
how do we find him?

00:29:16,356 --> 00:29:18,157
I think Miranda's
still the key.

00:29:18,157 --> 00:29:20,760
She's a teenage girl
who is sneaking out at night,

00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,729
and she's trying
to hook up with boys.

00:29:22,729 --> 00:29:24,397
So if we find out
where she's sneaking off to,

00:29:24,397 --> 00:29:25,865
we find the kid.
Exactly.

00:29:25,865 --> 00:29:27,734
So we have to go back
into the bunker,

00:29:27,734 --> 00:29:29,102
and we have to search it again.

00:29:29,102 --> 00:29:30,870
We have to look for something,
like a diary

00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:32,639
or-or some clue
to her secret life.

00:29:32,639 --> 00:29:33,740
(cell phone chimes)

00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,074
Like the way you're thinking.

00:29:35,074 --> 00:29:36,242
Thank you.

00:29:36,242 --> 00:29:37,377
Oh, boy.

00:29:37,377 --> 00:29:38,411
What?

00:29:38,411 --> 00:29:41,014
I think Dad just grounded us.

00:29:43,816 --> 00:29:45,718
CSI Russell, CSI Finlay,

00:29:45,718 --> 00:29:46,953
Jill McDermott.

00:29:46,953 --> 00:29:48,221
Tommy Barnes' attorney.
Pleasure.

00:29:48,221 --> 00:29:49,322
CRAWFORD:
Ms. McDermott is alleging

00:29:49,322 --> 00:29:51,090
that we violated her client's

00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:52,325
Fourth Amendment rights.

00:29:52,325 --> 00:29:54,060
Illegal search and seizure?

00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:56,129
You're saying we needed
a warrant to get in the bunker?

00:29:56,129 --> 00:29:58,031
Last time
I read the Constitution.

00:29:58,031 --> 00:29:59,399
CRAWFORD: I was
explaining to counsel

00:29:59,399 --> 00:30:01,134
the exigent circumstances.

00:30:01,134 --> 00:30:04,203
Your CSIs found blood
at the entrance of the bunker.

00:30:04,203 --> 00:30:07,707
Yes, not to mention that
the bunker is on public land.

00:30:07,707 --> 00:30:10,276
A little preview of how this is
gonna play in court.

00:30:10,276 --> 00:30:12,245
One, I don't buy

00:30:12,245 --> 00:30:13,713
exigent circumstances.

00:30:13,713 --> 00:30:15,348
And two,
while the Barnes estate

00:30:15,348 --> 00:30:18,418
generously donated much of its
land to the Koval Ridge Reserve,

00:30:18,418 --> 00:30:21,287
the estate maintains
all mineral rights.

00:30:21,287 --> 00:30:25,158
So everything under the surface
is still private property.

00:30:25,158 --> 00:30:26,693
And any evidence you collected

00:30:26,693 --> 00:30:28,161
in Mr. Barnes' home
gets thrown out.

00:30:28,161 --> 00:30:30,363
Fruit of the poisonous tree.

00:30:30,363 --> 00:30:32,932
I think a judge would be
reluctant to let you go digging

00:30:32,932 --> 00:30:35,001
around those roots again.
Of course, if you were

00:30:35,001 --> 00:30:36,703
to release my client now,

00:30:36,703 --> 00:30:38,805
I'd take that
as a good faith gesture.

00:30:38,805 --> 00:30:41,007
Might discourage me from
filing any civil action

00:30:41,007 --> 00:30:42,408
against the department.

00:30:42,408 --> 00:30:44,644
I'm sure you all have a lot
to discuss.

00:30:44,644 --> 00:30:45,712
Have a nice night.

00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,948
I know you wanted to get
back in that bunker.

00:30:48,948 --> 00:30:51,250
Yeah. We need a lead
to find out where Miranda goes

00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:52,852
when she meets the mystery kid.

00:30:52,852 --> 00:30:54,754
Maybe we don't have
to go back in there.

00:30:54,754 --> 00:30:56,089
I'm gonna call Hodges.

00:31:01,995 --> 00:31:03,930
(scanner humming)

00:31:10,803 --> 00:31:13,373
Hey. That crane
speaking to you yet?

00:31:13,373 --> 00:31:16,342
Whispering. I ran the
paper through the VSC,

00:31:16,342 --> 00:31:17,977
managed to get some detail.

00:31:17,977 --> 00:31:20,246
Looks like an MRE
packaging label.

00:31:20,246 --> 00:31:23,182
"Meals-Ready-to-Eat,"
as in military fare.

00:31:23,182 --> 00:31:25,318
Consistent with the
Barnes family lifestyle.

00:31:25,318 --> 00:31:27,320
You know, along the bottom,
that looks like

00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,255
a barcode.

00:31:29,255 --> 00:31:31,991
You know, these days, they
encode the shipping destination.

00:31:35,795 --> 00:31:38,064
(beeping)

00:31:40,266 --> 00:31:42,268
"Koval Ridge Supply Store."

00:31:51,711 --> 00:31:54,247
Well, it's not much, but
if you live out here,

00:31:54,247 --> 00:31:56,182
it's your one and only
stop shop.

00:31:56,182 --> 00:31:59,085
And it's the only civilization
a girl could find for miles.

00:31:59,085 --> 00:32:02,188
Good a place
as any to meet a guy.

00:32:02,188 --> 00:32:03,656
What? I've done worse.

00:32:03,656 --> 00:32:05,158
(laughs)

00:32:05,158 --> 00:32:07,093
(doorbells jingle)

00:32:10,329 --> 00:32:13,433
STOKES:
Whoa.

00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,309
I'm getting a serious feeling
of déjà vu here.

00:32:23,309 --> 00:32:25,211
Yup.

00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:30,883
Guess now we know
where Tommy Barnes got his gear.

00:32:30,883 --> 00:32:33,753
Yeah, and maybe
where our killer did, too.

00:32:40,293 --> 00:32:41,794
(door closes)

00:32:44,097 --> 00:32:46,866
Excuse me.

00:32:46,866 --> 00:32:48,434
You work here?

00:32:48,434 --> 00:32:51,370
No, stocking shelves
is my hobby.

00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:53,239
Well, we're, uh,
we're with the crime lab.

00:32:53,239 --> 00:32:54,707
We need to talk to you

00:32:54,707 --> 00:32:55,975
for a second.
What's your name?

00:32:55,975 --> 00:32:58,344
Luke.

00:32:58,344 --> 00:32:59,679
Luke. Luke what?

00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:01,848
LUKE:
Holland.

00:33:01,848 --> 00:33:03,716
You ever seen that guy?

00:33:03,716 --> 00:33:05,718
His friend says
he comes in here.

00:33:05,718 --> 00:33:08,121
No. A lot of people
come in here.

00:33:08,121 --> 00:33:10,223
STOKES:
Yeah. I can see that.

00:33:10,223 --> 00:33:12,325
How about this little girl
right here?

00:33:12,325 --> 00:33:13,726
You ever seen her?

00:33:15,128 --> 00:33:17,430
No. I've never seen her either.
BRODY: Nick.

00:33:19,932 --> 00:33:22,135
Remember what you said
about déjà vu?

00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,638
Is that your stuff, man?

00:33:27,073 --> 00:33:28,674
Call for backup!

00:33:32,845 --> 00:33:34,747
(engine sputtering)

00:33:38,751 --> 00:33:41,120
Going somewhere, Luke?
I didn't do nothing.

00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,189
Innocent people don't run
from the police.

00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:46,692
That's Carl Abrams' bike.

00:33:46,692 --> 00:33:48,327
Yeah, and I think
we just found his killer.

00:33:55,301 --> 00:33:56,803
STOKES:
We got you, Luke.

00:33:56,803 --> 00:33:58,104
The blood on the outside

00:33:58,104 --> 00:34:00,740
of the fatigues was a match
to Carl Abrams.

00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:03,042
And the DNA on the inside

00:34:03,042 --> 00:34:04,777
is gonna be
a match to you.

00:34:04,777 --> 00:34:07,713
You killed Carl,
and you dumped the body.

00:34:07,713 --> 00:34:09,816
You're wrong.

00:34:09,816 --> 00:34:11,217
Yeah, I got rid

00:34:11,217 --> 00:34:13,753
of Carl's body,
but I didn't kill him.

00:34:13,753 --> 00:34:16,722
Then who did? Miranda?
I don't know who did it.

00:34:16,722 --> 00:34:18,157
STOKES: You're gonna
have to do a lot

00:34:18,157 --> 00:34:19,158
better than that, Luke.

00:34:19,158 --> 00:34:20,426
Seriously, a lot better.

00:34:20,426 --> 00:34:21,427
I'm telling you

00:34:21,427 --> 00:34:23,129
the truth. I swear.

00:34:23,129 --> 00:34:25,031
<i>I was with Miranda</i>
<i>saying good night,</i>

00:34:25,031 --> 00:34:26,399
<i>and that's</i>
<i>when we heard him.</i>

00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:27,667
Help me.

00:34:27,667 --> 00:34:29,302
<i>Carl was hurt. Real bad.</i>

00:34:29,302 --> 00:34:32,138
<i>It was like</i>
<i>out of a horror movie.</i>

00:34:32,138 --> 00:34:35,708
<i>His hand was gone,</i>
<i>he was bleeding.</i>

00:34:35,708 --> 00:34:37,710
<i>There was nothing</i>
<i>we could do; he died</i>

00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:38,945
<i>right there in front of us.</i>

00:34:38,945 --> 00:34:40,146
I told her

00:34:40,146 --> 00:34:42,381
I'd take care of it,
so I cleaned up.

00:34:42,381 --> 00:34:43,950
I cut off Carl's

00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:45,818
other hand, so no one
could identify him.

00:34:45,818 --> 00:34:47,019
I dumped his body

00:34:47,019 --> 00:34:48,154
on the edge of town

00:34:48,154 --> 00:34:49,722
and cleared away his campsite.

00:34:49,722 --> 00:34:51,924
Well, that's a pretty
good story, I guess.

00:34:51,924 --> 00:34:54,794
But think I got a better one.

00:34:54,794 --> 00:34:58,030
It's not really a...
a horror movie.

00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:02,034
It's... more
of a tragic romance.

00:35:02,034 --> 00:35:04,237
See, I think
you killed Carl Abrams

00:35:04,237 --> 00:35:07,039
because the girl you loved
started showering her attention

00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:08,908
on him, not you.

00:35:08,908 --> 00:35:11,043
You think I killed Carl
over Miranda?

00:35:11,043 --> 00:35:12,845
STOKES:
Come on.

00:35:12,845 --> 00:35:15,014
We know about the love triangle.

00:35:15,014 --> 00:35:16,849
We got

00:35:16,849 --> 00:35:20,119
Carl's DNA in Miranda's bed
and an unknown male.

00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:22,822
We're not only gonna
match the fatigues to you,

00:35:22,822 --> 00:35:24,724
we're gonna
match the sheets.

00:35:24,724 --> 00:35:26,726
I'm not the one on those sheets.

00:35:26,726 --> 00:35:29,061
And there's no way...

00:35:29,061 --> 00:35:31,063
Miranda was with Carl.

00:35:31,063 --> 00:35:33,933
What are you saying?
Miranda's not that kind of girl?

00:35:33,933 --> 00:35:35,935
No, Carl's not that kind of guy.

00:35:35,935 --> 00:35:37,637
The dude's got a boyfriend.

00:35:37,637 --> 00:35:39,939
We all used
to hang out together

00:35:39,939 --> 00:35:42,141
in the bunker when her dad
was away. Guess now I know

00:35:42,141 --> 00:35:44,677
what those boys were up to
when they ran off to her room.

00:35:44,677 --> 00:35:46,145
You're looking
at the wrong

00:35:46,145 --> 00:35:47,813
jealous boyfriend.

00:35:47,813 --> 00:35:49,815
Carl Abrams' boyfriend
got a name?

00:35:50,917 --> 00:35:52,351
Dylan Trigg.

00:35:52,351 --> 00:35:54,353
He and Carl were
into motocross and camping.

00:35:54,353 --> 00:35:56,355
That's how Miranda
and I first met them--

00:35:56,355 --> 00:35:58,291
camping up
on Horizon Peak.

00:35:58,291 --> 00:35:59,425
Yeah.

00:35:59,425 --> 00:36:02,161
Carl was my boyfriend.

00:36:02,161 --> 00:36:04,297
Why didn't you say anything
about this before?

00:36:04,297 --> 00:36:07,366
(sighs)
I'm not exactly out.

00:36:07,366 --> 00:36:09,902
Was he out?
Carl didn't
give a damn about

00:36:09,902 --> 00:36:11,170
what anybody thought.

00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:12,338
STOKES:
That include you?

00:36:12,338 --> 00:36:13,339
Pretty much.

00:36:13,339 --> 00:36:14,840
Was that a problem?

00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,676
Yeah, it was a problem.

00:36:16,676 --> 00:36:18,044
Carl didn't get it.

00:36:18,044 --> 00:36:19,712
It was so easy for him.

00:36:19,712 --> 00:36:22,315
He said that...
if I had any guts,

00:36:22,315 --> 00:36:24,016
I'd tell people the truth.

00:36:24,016 --> 00:36:26,352
Is that what you two
fought about that night?

00:36:28,187 --> 00:36:29,889
Do I need a lawyer?

00:36:29,889 --> 00:36:31,223
I don't know, Dylan.

00:36:31,223 --> 00:36:32,425
Do you?

00:36:35,661 --> 00:36:38,798
Hey, I found motorcycle tracks
back up on the ridge.

00:36:38,798 --> 00:36:40,866
They match the tires
on Carl's bike.

00:36:40,866 --> 00:36:43,102
So far, Luke Holland's
story's holding up.

00:36:43,102 --> 00:36:45,237
Let's hope it gets us
to the crime scene.

00:36:45,237 --> 00:36:47,273
I got two sets
of shoe impressions.

00:36:47,273 --> 00:36:49,342
One looks like work boots,

00:36:49,342 --> 00:36:51,077
and the other has a tread
like the shoes

00:36:51,077 --> 00:36:53,279
we found on Carl Abrams.

00:36:53,279 --> 00:36:55,648
It's long strides.

00:36:55,648 --> 00:36:57,350
Carl was running.

00:36:57,350 --> 00:36:59,118
Looks like...

00:36:59,118 --> 00:37:01,320
he slowed down
around here,

00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,322
stopped,

00:37:03,322 --> 00:37:05,057
backed up.

00:37:06,726 --> 00:37:09,662
SANDERS:
Right into a bear trap.

00:37:10,763 --> 00:37:12,331
(screaming)

00:37:12,331 --> 00:37:14,667
It's got blood
on it, just like

00:37:14,667 --> 00:37:15,868
Doc Robbins suspected.

00:37:15,868 --> 00:37:18,304
Mechanism's rusted.

00:37:18,304 --> 00:37:20,106
Must've broken when it
snapped on Carl's leg.

00:37:20,106 --> 00:37:21,974
That's why he was
able to get away.

00:37:21,974 --> 00:37:24,076
SIDLE:
He didn't get very far.

00:37:24,076 --> 00:37:25,845
I just found
Carl's right hand.

00:37:28,314 --> 00:37:29,982
Buckshot in the wound.

00:37:29,982 --> 00:37:32,051
Confirms it was a shotgun.

00:37:32,051 --> 00:37:34,387
Still...

00:37:34,387 --> 00:37:37,089
there's blood and tissue
under his fingernails.

00:37:37,089 --> 00:37:39,392
We lucked out. Carl got
a piece of his killer.

00:37:39,392 --> 00:37:40,726
DYLAN:
<i>You guys don't understand.</i>

00:37:40,726 --> 00:37:42,995
I loved Carl.

00:37:42,995 --> 00:37:44,397
I would never hurt him.

00:37:44,397 --> 00:37:46,098
BRODY: I'm sure
you didn't mean to.

00:37:46,098 --> 00:37:48,300
You were the one who told us
where Carl was camping.

00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,036
You sent us to Koval Ridge.

00:37:50,036 --> 00:37:53,005
Clearly, you wanted us
to discover the truth.

00:37:53,005 --> 00:37:55,975
I'm sure you feel terrible
about what happened.

00:37:55,975 --> 00:37:57,943
You know there's only one way
to make this right.

00:38:02,715 --> 00:38:04,817
What the hell is going on here?

00:38:10,756 --> 00:38:13,125
I think I want
that lawyer now.

00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:16,362
RUSSELL: Mr. Trigg, this is
your son Dylan's confession.

00:38:16,362 --> 00:38:19,065
He told us that you
admitted to assaulting

00:38:19,065 --> 00:38:21,801
and hunting down
Carl Abrams,

00:38:21,801 --> 00:38:24,170
shooting him
and leaving him for dead.

00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:27,206
My son is lying;
I never told him any such thing.

00:38:27,206 --> 00:38:29,275
Dylan's head is
so filled with lies

00:38:29,275 --> 00:38:30,910
because that...

00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:33,646
kid, Carl Abrams,
messed with him.

00:38:33,646 --> 00:38:35,781
Screwed him up
so he doesn't know who he is

00:38:35,781 --> 00:38:37,283
or what the truth is anymore.

00:38:37,283 --> 00:38:38,284
You're right,

00:38:38,284 --> 00:38:39,852
your son is confused--

00:38:39,852 --> 00:38:42,321
because he's had to live a lie.

00:38:42,321 --> 00:38:43,923
Thanks to you.

00:38:43,923 --> 00:38:45,925
Think you just made
my case in court.

00:38:45,925 --> 00:38:48,127
This confession isn't worth
the paper it's written on.

00:38:48,127 --> 00:38:50,830
Well, that's why
we depend on evidence.

00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:53,766
This is a tire track
found on an access road

00:38:53,766 --> 00:38:55,334
near the scene
of the crime.

00:38:55,334 --> 00:38:57,036
Matches your truck.

00:38:57,036 --> 00:38:58,771
Lead trace found in
Carl Abrams' wound

00:38:58,771 --> 00:39:00,639
and pellet size

00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:02,908
matches the shotgun

00:39:02,908 --> 00:39:05,044
and the ammunition
we found in your home.

00:39:05,044 --> 00:39:06,779
Don't tell me
I'm the only one

00:39:06,779 --> 00:39:08,881
who uses that ammo.
No, but you're the only one

00:39:08,881 --> 00:39:11,984
that was up on the ridge
that night with Carl Abrams.

00:39:13,319 --> 00:39:14,954
Maybe you recognize...

00:39:14,954 --> 00:39:17,389
Carl's hand.

00:39:17,389 --> 00:39:20,025
We found your DNA

00:39:20,025 --> 00:39:21,327
underneath his
fingernails.

00:39:21,327 --> 00:39:23,295
I guess he must
have scratched you.

00:39:23,295 --> 00:39:26,332
In death, Carl has given
us more than enough

00:39:26,332 --> 00:39:28,234
to convict you.

00:39:28,234 --> 00:39:31,904
My son is not what
that kid tried to make him.

00:39:31,904 --> 00:39:33,639
I had to protect Dylan.

00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:35,007
By killing the boy?

00:39:35,007 --> 00:39:37,843
I told him to stay away;
he laughed in my face!

00:39:37,843 --> 00:39:39,378
He said my son

00:39:39,378 --> 00:39:41,046
didn't belong to me anymore.

00:39:41,046 --> 00:39:42,381
That he belonged to him.

00:39:42,381 --> 00:39:44,216
That Dylan
was born to...

00:39:44,216 --> 00:39:46,952
(panting)

00:39:46,952 --> 00:39:48,320
...to love him.

00:39:50,089 --> 00:39:53,192
My son was born to be a man.

00:39:53,192 --> 00:39:55,661
He was.

00:39:55,661 --> 00:39:58,998
And he proved that
when he signed this confession.

00:40:09,675 --> 00:40:10,676
Dad.

00:40:12,645 --> 00:40:15,881
I'm so sorry, Dad.

00:40:15,881 --> 00:40:18,684
(crying):
It's all my fault.

00:40:18,684 --> 00:40:19,852
No, no, no, no.

00:40:19,852 --> 00:40:21,353
I'm just glad
you're okay.

00:40:21,353 --> 00:40:25,391
I knew that
the first time I sneaked out.

00:40:25,391 --> 00:40:27,993
I just-- I saw the campfires

00:40:27,993 --> 00:40:30,262
and I heard the other kids'
voices in the night.

00:40:30,262 --> 00:40:32,731
I just wanted to be
a part of it.
It's okay, honey.

00:40:32,731 --> 00:40:36,135
Every kid wants to
explore the world, okay?

00:40:36,135 --> 00:40:40,239
But that's just it, Dad--
I had a world.

00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:42,942
You loved me enough
to make one for me,

00:40:42,942 --> 00:40:44,143
and I destroyed it.

00:40:44,143 --> 00:40:46,712
I've let all the bad in.

00:40:46,712 --> 00:40:50,316
Because you're right, Dad,
that's all there is out there.

00:40:50,316 --> 00:40:53,219
And when you open the door,
that's all that comes in.

00:40:53,219 --> 00:40:56,088
No, no, no, no,
sweetheart, no.

00:40:56,088 --> 00:40:57,723
(sighs)

00:40:57,723 --> 00:41:00,726
I was wrong.

00:41:00,726 --> 00:41:03,262
See, when I was your age...

00:41:03,262 --> 00:41:05,731
nothing could hold me back.

00:41:05,731 --> 00:41:08,234
Everything was possible.

00:41:08,234 --> 00:41:11,203
And I robbed that from you.

00:41:11,203 --> 00:41:14,740
When we lost Mom, I kept
you from everything

00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:16,875
and everyone
that you knew.

00:41:16,875 --> 00:41:19,645
Well, the important thing now
is where you go from here.

00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,249
Not underground,
that's for sure.

00:41:23,249 --> 00:41:25,751
Dad, are you sure?

00:41:25,751 --> 00:41:27,219
Yeah, I'm sure.

00:41:27,219 --> 00:41:30,356
Remember when you asked
me if I had any plans

00:41:30,356 --> 00:41:32,258
for Miranda when
she turned 17?

00:41:32,258 --> 00:41:34,193
Yeah.

00:41:34,193 --> 00:41:37,730
Well, there's a town up in
Oregon where your mom's from.

00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:39,431
It's this perfect
little place--

00:41:39,431 --> 00:41:42,034
it's got this quaint
little Main Street,

00:41:42,034 --> 00:41:43,435
everyone knows
each other.

00:41:43,435 --> 00:41:45,404
Sounds like
a really, really good idea.

00:41:45,404 --> 00:41:46,739
It is.

00:41:46,739 --> 00:41:48,907
Honey, you got
family there.

00:41:48,907 --> 00:41:52,711
I think that's a pretty good
place for you to start all over.

00:41:52,711 --> 00:41:53,912
What do you say?

00:41:55,014 --> 00:41:57,249
(laughs)

00:42:00,019 --> 00:42:02,288
I love you, sweetheart.

00:42:02,288 --> 00:42:05,758
(sighs)
I love you, too, Dad.
