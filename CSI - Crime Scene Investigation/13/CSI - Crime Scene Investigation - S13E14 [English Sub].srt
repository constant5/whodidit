00:00:01,902 --> 00:00:04,771
(sultry, urgent
Afro-Cuban music playing)

00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:19,252
(singing in Spanish)

00:00:30,564 --> 00:00:32,466
(screaming)

00:00:32,466 --> 00:00:33,600
(singing in Spanish)

00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:41,608
(horns blasting, woman screams)

00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,246
(music blaring,
woman screaming)

00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:55,756
(woman wails)

00:00:55,756 --> 00:00:56,757
(song ends)

00:00:56,757 --> 00:00:58,492
(light applause)

00:00:58,492 --> 00:01:00,961
Bravo, Silvana, save some
of that for opening night.

00:01:00,961 --> 00:01:02,396
Silvana's on fire.

00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:03,830
We're gonna make
some money, bro.

00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:06,600
Good for you...
and for your club.

00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,335
Well, good for
all of us, right?

00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:10,804
This is not about the money
for me, bro.

00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:13,273
It's about the soul
of Cuba.

00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:14,374
The music.

00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:15,876
(Silvana speaking Spanish)

00:01:15,876 --> 00:01:17,878
<i>Venga.</i>

00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:20,881
<i>Cuidado,</i> Vegas,
Silvana has arrived.

00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:22,349
Vegas is just
the beginning.

00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:23,350
Sure, sure, sure.

00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:24,651
<i>Necesitamos hablar</i> press.

00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:25,952
We do the local news,

00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:28,722
and after the first show,
CNN, Fox, MSNBC.

00:01:28,722 --> 00:01:30,957
The sky's the limit.
Come on.

00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:34,594
(conversing in Spanish)

00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,463
Marta!

00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:39,599
(sobbing):
Marta...!

00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,902
No!

00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:43,203
Oh, Marta...!

00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:44,838
(camera clicking)

00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:46,540
(indistinct radio communication,
sirens wailing in distance)

00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,541
Thank you.

00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:48,642
Hey, fellas,

00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:50,677
what do we got?
Marta Cuerto,

00:01:50,677 --> 00:01:53,313
32, Cuban national.

00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:55,682
Sister to
Silvana Cuerto,

00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:57,617
Cuban pop star.

00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:58,652
Who found the body?

00:01:58,652 --> 00:02:00,253
Silvana and her manager.

00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:03,657
So, no signs of
a disturbance.

00:02:03,657 --> 00:02:05,792
No blood, no cleanup,
which means

00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,294
this isn't the primary.

00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:10,630
The body was staged,
just like that,

00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,866
and one of Silvana's costumes

00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:14,000
was taken
off the rack

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,403
and put
on the victim's body.

00:02:16,403 --> 00:02:19,239
That explains the lack
of blood on the dress.

00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:20,807
What do we got
going here, bud?

00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:24,811
Blunt force trauma-- the face
and most of her upper torso.

00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:28,348
Semicircular impressions
all over the body.

00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:31,585
(thermometer beeps)
Liver temp is 90.4.

00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:33,286
She died about six hours ago.

00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:36,523
I'll get the gurney.

00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:40,961
So our killer brings her here,
stages the body...

00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:42,662
nobody even notices?

00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:45,232
She was rehearsing
for a couple of hours onstage.

00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:47,868
The music's loud,
people are distracted.

00:02:47,868 --> 00:02:49,836
How many ways in and out
of here?
Only two.

00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,805
Door from the stage,
and there's a back door

00:02:51,805 --> 00:02:54,241
down that hallway
leading to the alley.

00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:56,409
Well, that's the how;
I'd like to know the why.

00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:57,611
Silvana's sister...

00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:03,250
...in her dress,
sitting at her vanity...

00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,686
...staring into her mirror.

00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,593
You got something?

00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:14,961
Yeah.

00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:36,683
<i>"Silvana, eres</i>

00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:40,887

<i>Next to...</i>

00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:29,769
rum and cigars, Silvana is
Cuba's biggest export.

00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,705
So, how come
I've never heard of her, then?

00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:33,907
I don't know, I mean,
she's been touring Europe,

00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:35,709
now she's finally
coming to the States.

00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:38,278
Didn't know you were
such a big Cuban music fan.

00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,281
You know, Sex Pistols,
Sinatra, Silvana--

00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:44,618
I'm equal opportunity
like that.

00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,219
If she's so popular,

00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:48,355
why are all these
people here protesting?

00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,294
I'm very sorry
for your loss, Ms. Cuerto.

00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,797
It's like...
part of me is dead.

00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,966
I do have to ask you
some questions.

00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,968
I'm sorry.
I understand.

00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,336
I know that you
and your manager

00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:04,371
found your sister
Marta.

00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:05,739
Right?

00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:07,574
Was there anyone else
backstage, anyone

00:05:07,574 --> 00:05:09,743
who didn't belong?
No, just us.

00:05:09,743 --> 00:05:11,378
When was the last time
you saw Marta?

00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:12,679
Yesterday.

00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:15,749
We had lunch, then
she went shopping.

00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:16,983
Shopping?

00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,752
Marta does wardrobe
for the show.

00:05:18,752 --> 00:05:21,588
She made all of my costumes.

00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,625
My whole life,
she's taken care of me.

00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:28,962
And coming here,
I was so scared.

00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:33,667
But Marta gave
me the strength.

00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,669
She was so happy for me,

00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:39,873
like it was her
up in that stage...

00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:42,375
and I felt her with me.

00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:46,780
Did your sister mention
receiving threats?

00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,315
Everyone loved Marta.

00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:50,917
Okay, how about you?

00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:52,819
Have you received
any threats?

00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:55,255
MANAGER: <i>Silvana received</i>
<i>threats every day,</i>

00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:57,257
ever since we arrive
in this country.

00:05:57,257 --> 00:05:58,358
Threats from whom,

00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,959
Mr. Ficha?
Los Gusanos--

00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:03,530
the so-called Cuban exiles

00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,466
who want Silvana
to go home or die.

00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:07,634
You're talking about
the people outside.

00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:09,502
That's right.

00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:11,638
It's a long way from carrying
a sign to killing someone.

00:06:11,638 --> 00:06:13,673
I don't expect you
to understand.

00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:17,777
Politics in your country
is entertainment.

00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:21,681
In Cuba, it's passion;
it's blood.

00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:23,783
These threats
against Silvana--

00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:25,552
were they anonymous?

00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:30,356
The threats, yes...
the source... no.

00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:31,825
What do you mean by that?

00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:34,794
The leader of the exile
community-- Eddie Santos--

00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:36,629
he's been following us
ever since we landed--

00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:39,733
outside the hotel, outside
the restaurant where we eat,

00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,835
outside this club.
Why didn't you report him?

00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:44,370
I did-- to your
State Department.

00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,705
Obviously,
your government is deaf

00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:48,475
to the concerns
of the loyal Cuban citizens.

00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:50,443
Some more loyal than others.

00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:52,345
Hmm.
Couldn't help but
notice on your passport

00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:55,248
there's an entry--
<i>"Gobierno Cubano."</i>

00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,883
My Spanish is a
little rusty, but I'm

00:06:56,883 --> 00:07:00,487
pretty sure that means
"Cuban government."

00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:03,823
You're not just Silvana's
manager, are you?

00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:07,627
I was assigned to accompany
Silvana on her tour--

00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:08,828
Marta, too.

00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:10,263
You're a handler.

00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,364
Yeah, that makes sense.

00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:12,732
I mean, a talent
like Silvana--

00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:14,000
you're the guy
assigned to make sure

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,971
that she, uh...
finds her way back home.

00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:22,742
Perhaps if I had been
more vigilant...

00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:24,878
Marta would still be alive.

00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:28,414
Got black streaks
on the floor here.

00:07:34,354 --> 00:07:36,356
Looks like some kind
of oil residue.

00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,592
I've got a fiber here.

00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:41,394
Could help us find our primary.

00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:47,000
More fibers
at the base of the chair.

00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:53,773
There's a trail heading
right out of the room.

00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:57,844
And down the hallway

00:07:57,844 --> 00:07:59,746
to the door
to the alley.

00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:01,748
You thinking what I'm thinking?

00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:04,651
When fibers get snagged
on the floor like that, it means

00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,686
<i>material was dragged.</i>

00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:10,623
SANDERS: <i>Weighed down like</i>
<i>a body in some kind of sack.</i>

00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,293
Body dump.

00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:17,497
But where did the
killer stash the sack?

00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:25,872
What are the odds?

00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:38,251
(sighs)

00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:41,788
SIDLE: So much for security
at your club, Mr. Mejia.

00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:43,756
In fact,
the only functioning camera

00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:46,359
in this entire club
that's working is aimed

00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,261
at the cash register
behind the bar.

00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:50,230
Kind of sums up your
priorities, don't you think?

00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,264
You're out of line.

00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:52,265
I don't think so.

00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:53,766
Given what I saw
outside,

00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:55,969
you have no excuse for not
providing adequate security.

00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:57,470
I tried.

00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,272
I installed these
cameras this month.

00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:01,641
I've had to fix 'em four
times already. Ever since

00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:03,776
I announced that Silvana
was performing at the club,

00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:05,345
I've had acts of
vandalism every night.

00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:07,380
You're pointing
a finger at the exiles?

00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,781
All I'm saying is,
I don't get how people

00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:10,817
who are otherwise
calm and law-abiding

00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:12,552
can go crazy over
ancient history,

00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:13,987
wounds that are
over 50 years old.

00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:15,655
Aren't you Cuban?

00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:17,423
Cuban-American.

00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:19,759
My parents and I came here
20 years ago, when I was 11.

00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,861
This is my country, not Cuba.

00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:23,563
My generation-- here.

00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,465
Marta's and Silvana's--
over there.

00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:27,433
We just want to be free
to live our lives,

00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:28,735
follow our dreams.

00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,737
Yeah, well, somebody ended
that for Marta Cuerto,

00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,405
and Silvana
may be next,

00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,507
so, if this show must go on,

Cuban music playing)

Beautiful music, Doc.

00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:45,285
(player beeps off)
Oh, brings back memories.

00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:46,586
Have you been to Cuba?

00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,854
15 years ago.

00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:49,522
I was invited to a symposium

00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:51,991
on forensic pathology
in Havana.

00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:53,927
Hmm, you must have
some good stories.

00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,295
Actually, that's why
I called you here.

00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:56,562
But this story is
far from good.

00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:59,565
This pattern of injuries
is quite specific

00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:00,900
and not new to me.

00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,368
What do you mean?

00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:03,836
Injuries on the wrists

00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:05,705
indicate the victim
was forcibly restrained.

00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:06,706
Ligature marks.

00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:09,709
Width suggests rope.

00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:11,878
Same ligature marks
on her ankles.

00:10:11,878 --> 00:10:13,379
Slight bruising
on her shoulders

00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:16,783
from a hyperextension
of the muscles.

00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:20,687
And this bruising on her abdomen
says the victim was subjected

00:10:20,687 --> 00:10:23,556
to an extended period
of intense pressure.

00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:25,325
Which all adds up to what?

00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:27,660
She was hog-tied.

00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,763
(moaning, screaming)

00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:32,999
So you're saying
systematic torture?
I met a journalist

00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:35,435
in Cuba who claimed
to have been arrested

00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:36,903
by the authorities.

00:10:36,903 --> 00:10:38,571
He described
an account of torture

00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:40,473
referred to as <i>"la silla."</i>

00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,508
Which means
"the chair."
According to him,

00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:45,511
it was a technique commonly
employed by the Cuban police.

00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:48,414
After a few hours,
they lifted him off the floor,

00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:49,816
tied him to a chair,

00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:52,418
and beat him into submission
with a pipe.

00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:53,786
The pipe would
be consistent

00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:56,522
with the semicircular gashes
all over her body.

00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:57,924
Do you have anything else?

00:10:57,924 --> 00:10:59,859
Well, no obvious signs
of sexual assault.

00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:01,928
I sent the SAE kit to DNA.

00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:03,963
But I did find this...

00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:08,568
partially embedded
in the skin of her left heel.

you're engaged?

00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:40,686
What about the beating?

00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:43,656
While poisoning appears
to be the ultimate C.O.D.,

00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:45,391
vital response in the wounds

00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:47,393
suggests they were
simultaneous events.

00:18:47,393 --> 00:18:49,695
So the killer poisoned her
and beat her.

00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:53,666
You were talking
about Cuban police torture.

00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,568
Did you ever come across
anything like this?

00:18:55,568 --> 00:18:57,203
Never.

00:18:57,203 --> 00:18:58,938
FINLAY:
And the cherry red color
is indicative

00:18:58,938 --> 00:19:01,574
of cyanide, isn't it?
Well, the short
answer's yes.

00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:04,510
I can't tell you how
it would have gotten
into her system.

00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,712
Didn't find any injection marks,

00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:09,548
no inhaled residue
in her nasal passages.

00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:11,450
What about her stomach contents?

00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,619
Already sent that off to Hodges.

00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:15,988
Silvana's manager, Antonio,
provided everybody in the band

00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,757
with prepaid cell phones;
I pulled up every call

00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:20,759
that Marta made the
day that she died.

00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:22,728
Made calls to her
sister, Antonio,

00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:25,297
couple of calls
to the Rumbason Club,

00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:26,799
also some fabric stores
and fashion outlets.

00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,334
RUSSELL:
Well, that makes sense.

00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:29,835
Silvana said that
Marta went shopping

00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,537
for wardrobe for the show.

00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:33,572
Rehearsal wasn't until 8:00.

00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:35,741
SIDLE:
Here are the last calls
she ever made--

00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:38,677
three in a row
right around 2:30 p.m.

00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,646
Couple hours before she died.

00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:42,281
No caller I.D.'s.

00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:43,916
702 number's
another prepaid cell.

00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,484
RUSSELL:
202.

00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:47,753
Well, that's Washington, DC.
Yeah.

00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:49,955
Let's do a reverse
directory search on that.

00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:51,423
Read my mind.

00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:54,260
(blipping)

00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,995
SIDLE:
Access denied.

00:19:55,995 --> 00:19:58,964
Put that together
with Cuba and Washington, DC.

00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:01,300
The plot thickens.
You know,

00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,769
I don't want to go
to that CIA place, but...

00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:05,671
I'm kind of going
to that CIA place.

00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:13,579
(Sam whining)

00:20:14,747 --> 00:20:16,749
Want a bite?

00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:18,450
Here you go, bud.

00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,786
Easy, easy.

00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:21,720
Dog walker on vacation?

00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:24,657
Yeah, stomach flu.

00:20:24,657 --> 00:20:26,358
Huh.
Speaking of,
is that

00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:28,561
the report on Marta Cuerto's
stomach contents?

00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:29,762
This? Uh, no.

00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:31,263
This is personal.

00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:33,232
Okay. No problem.

00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,801
If you must know,
uh, it's Morgan's
character reference

00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:38,871
to Immigration in support of
my engagement to Elisabetta.

00:20:38,871 --> 00:20:40,973
Wow. Well, you know,
I would've been happy

00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:42,675
to write you a character
reference-- I mean,

00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:43,809
I would've left out
the part about

00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:45,444
your criminal record but...

00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:47,713
Well, clearly, I should've
talked to you first.

00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:49,348
Congratulations, buddy.

00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:50,649
I look forward to
meeting her sometime.

00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:53,319
An oversight I plan to correct.

00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:54,620
Hear that, Sam?

00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,688
He's getting married.
(barks)

00:20:55,688 --> 00:20:56,989
(laughs)

00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:58,424
So, stomach contents.

00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:00,759
Yeah, in my office.
All right.

00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,227
Sammy, I got some work
to do now, boy.

00:21:02,227 --> 00:21:05,564
Stay here,
I'll be right back.

00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:08,000
Based on my analysis of Marta
Cuerto's stomach contents,

00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,270
I know how the cyanide got
into her system.

00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:15,774
GCMS picked up linamarin,
lotaustralin...

00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,811
cyanogenic glucosides.

00:21:18,811 --> 00:21:20,713
Well, how the hell
did they get in there?

00:21:20,713 --> 00:21:23,415
Page two.
Lovely illustration.

00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:25,584
Behold the cassava leaf,

00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:27,853
which has been known to produce
medicinal properties,

00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:29,755
only if processed carefully.

00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:30,923
And if not?

00:21:30,923 --> 00:21:32,458
Uh, nasty business.

00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,926
Especially in the hands
of our killer,

00:21:33,926 --> 00:21:36,695
<i>who, it seems,</i>
<i>force-fed them to Marta,</i>

00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:38,998
<i>knowing that the glucosides</i>
<i>from the unprocessed leaves</i>

00:21:38,998 --> 00:21:40,499
<i>would react</i>
<i>with stomach enzymes</i>

00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:42,234
<i>to produce hydrogen cyanide.</i>

00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:43,936
<i>Which is then absorbed</i>
<i>through the stomach lining</i>

00:21:43,936 --> 00:21:45,771
<i>into the bloodstream.</i>

00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:47,439
<i>Once in the blood,</i>
<i>cyanide binds to hemoglobin</i>

00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:49,308
<i>more strongly than oxygen,</i>

00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,743
<i>preventing the oxygen</i>
<i>from getting to the cells.</i>

00:21:50,743 --> 00:21:53,345
<i>The result-- asphyxiation.</i>

00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:54,480
Suffocation.

00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,815
And death.

00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:59,818
Heard our suspect's DNA shows
he's related to Eddie Santos.

00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:02,521
Russell said you were doing
a little genealogy?
Yeah.

00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:03,889
And this family tree has

00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:05,758
some seriously poisoned roots
back in Cuba.

00:22:05,758 --> 00:22:08,227
I accessed
the Clark County Museum

00:22:08,227 --> 00:22:09,895
of Hispanic Heritage database.

00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:11,330
I found this.

00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,865
BRODY:
1973

00:22:12,865 --> 00:22:14,967
Cuban Army photo.
Guy on the left--

00:22:14,967 --> 00:22:17,403
Colonel Carlos Cuerto.

00:22:17,403 --> 00:22:19,738
Cuerto? Related to
the Cuerto sisters?

00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:22,207
Grandfather, and the guy
next to him--

00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:25,344
25-year-old Sergeant
Eduardo Santos.

00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,745
Young Eddie Santos.

00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:28,247
A year after this,

00:22:28,247 --> 00:22:30,749
Eddie and two comrades
made a crack about

00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:33,252
Colonel Cuerto's ties
to the black market.

00:22:33,252 --> 00:22:35,454
They were arrested
and thrown in jail.

00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:37,256
Where they were tortured.

00:22:37,256 --> 00:22:38,757
For six years

00:22:38,757 --> 00:22:40,559
at the hands of
Colonel Cuerto himself.

00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,961
This may have nothing to
do with politics at all.

00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:45,898
It's a feud between the
Cuerto and Santos family.

00:22:45,898 --> 00:22:47,733
Yeah, simmering for 40 years.

00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:50,502
And I think I know which
family member exacted revenge.

00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:54,373
Hilda Santos, sister
of Eddie Santos,

00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,275
emigrated from
Cuba in '92,

00:22:56,275 --> 00:22:58,343
married Oscar Mejia.

00:22:58,343 --> 00:22:59,745
They had one son together.

00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:03,949
Estefan Mejia, owner
of the Rumbason.

00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:06,518
Also...

00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:08,353
Eddie Santos' nephew.

00:23:10,823 --> 00:23:12,758
(Silvana singing in Spanish)

00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:27,973
What do you guys want?

00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:29,475
We just want to talk

00:23:29,475 --> 00:23:31,577
to you about your uncle,
Eddie Santos.

00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:32,778
MORGAN:
And the vendetta your family

00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:34,480
has against the Cuertos family.

00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,914
Vendetta? I have no
part in any vendetta.

00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,282
SANDERS:
Really?

00:23:37,282 --> 00:23:38,784
Then why don't you explain to us

00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:41,687
how we found your DNA
on Marta Cuerto's body

00:23:41,687 --> 00:23:43,822
in your uncle's auto shop?

00:23:43,822 --> 00:23:46,225
The DNA you left behind
when you raped and killed her.

00:23:46,225 --> 00:23:48,761
(Silvana gasping,
mic feedback whining)

00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:50,863
(muttering)

00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:56,401
Mitch, call an ambulance!

00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:05,711
(distant, echoing
singing in Spanish)

00:24:05,711 --> 00:24:08,714
(indistinct chatter)

00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:14,286
I'm going with her.
Sir, I'm sorry.
I can't let you

00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,388
in there right now.
Get your hands off me. I demand
to be inside with Silvana.

00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:18,257
Mitch, I've got this.

00:24:18,257 --> 00:24:19,725
Mr. Ficha, I'm so sorry.

00:24:19,725 --> 00:24:22,327
Let me talk to you
just for a second.

00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:24,897
Silvana's exhibiting the same
signs of poisoning as Marta--

00:24:24,897 --> 00:24:27,299
cyanide-- now,
I've told the doctors,

00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,934
so they know what to do.

00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:31,270
You saw the message scrawled
in Silvana's dressing room.

00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:33,438
Those animals
said she was next.

00:24:33,438 --> 00:24:35,307
Where were you?

00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,743
We do have a suspect
in custody, sir.

00:24:37,743 --> 00:24:39,912
A little late, don't you think?

00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:44,416
Why won't you tell me
what's happening with Silvana?

00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:45,951
Why? You trying
to figure out

00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:47,753
if you're on the hook
for one murder or two?

00:24:47,753 --> 00:24:49,288
What?!

00:24:49,288 --> 00:24:50,689
Your club is getting
a bad rep, Estefan.

00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:52,491
First Marta.

00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:55,561
Now your star attraction,
Silvana, collapses on stage.

00:24:55,561 --> 00:24:57,329
STOKES:
Yeah, at first we
thought you just

00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,498
had lousy security, given
the angry crowd outside,

00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,500
but now we know

00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,535
that the real threat
was coming from inside.

00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:05,237
Coming from you.

00:25:05,237 --> 00:25:07,239
I told you,
I don't share the same beliefs

00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:08,607
as the exile community.

00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:09,908
Maybe not them,
but what about your uncle?

00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:11,343
That's a different story.

00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:12,845
Blood is thicker
than politics, right?

00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:14,780
I don't know
what you're talking about.

00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,448
STOKES:
You know exactly what
we're talking about.

00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:19,284
Let me show
you something.

00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:22,955
I think you referred to this
as "ancient history."

00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:28,927
Let me show you a
little recent history.

00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:30,929
I think you recognize
that, don't you?

00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:33,265
Look familiar?

00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:35,901
CRAWFORD:
How'd it go down?

00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:38,871
Did your uncle watch
while you raped her?

00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:40,873
And then, you two guys,

00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:43,242
what, you tied her up,
then you beat her.

00:25:43,242 --> 00:25:44,910
STOKES:
And then forced
cassava leaves

00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:48,280
down her throat and
watched her suffocate.

00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,915
No.

00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:51,483
DNA doesn't lie, man!
We know it was you!

00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:53,352
I didn't. I couldn't hurt her.

00:25:53,352 --> 00:25:55,888
So? It was your uncle then.

00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:57,623
No! I mean, I don't know.

00:25:57,623 --> 00:26:00,292
You don't know?
No, I wasn't there...

00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:01,860
when this happened.

00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,829
Look, my uncle tried to turn me
against the Cuertos,

00:26:03,829 --> 00:26:06,698
but Silvana, Marta
and I were friends.

00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:08,567
I lived with them
when I was a kid.

00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,669
Even when I came to this
country, we stayed in touch.

00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:12,471
When Silvana's
career took off,

00:26:12,471 --> 00:26:14,339
I saw it as a chance
to bring them here.

00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:15,707
STOKES:
No, you saw it

00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:19,711
as an opportunity to
lure the Cuerto sisters

00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:21,880
and settle an old score.

00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,682
My uncle's fight
is not my fight!

00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:25,450
I couldn't hurt her!

00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:26,985
I couldn't hurt Marta!

00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:28,987
Her and I were in love.

00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:31,823
Is that why you took her
to your uncle's body shop?

00:26:31,823 --> 00:26:33,992
That's not my
idea of romance.

00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:35,928
It was the only place
near the Rumbason

00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:37,329
where we could meet...
in secret.

00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:42,267
<i>Marta called me,</i>
<i>and I went to her.</i>

00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:43,969
(moaning)
<i>We made love.</i>

00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:46,305
I got to go.
I'll see you tonight.

00:26:48,674 --> 00:26:50,375
Marta was still alive
when I left.

00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:52,377
I swear.

00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:53,879
What about your uncle?
Where was he at?

00:26:55,514 --> 00:26:57,683
I can't tell you.

00:26:59,418 --> 00:27:02,254
You can't... or you won't?

00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:06,825
HODGES:
<i>Si, si, si.</i>

00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:08,493
<i>Sono contento.</i>

00:27:08,493 --> 00:27:10,762
No, Elisabetta,
I'm-I'm very happy.

00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:13,265
It-It's just
that it's-it's hard.

00:27:13,265 --> 00:27:14,833
Um... <i>difficile,</i>

00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:18,236
uh, for me to express it...
in Italian.

00:27:18,236 --> 00:27:20,505
It's, uh... it's the
language barrier and...

00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:22,975
Elisabetta. Hello?

00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:24,576
Hello?

00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:25,978
(sighs)

00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:28,313
(phone beeps off)
Sorry to interrupt.

00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,649
Hi.
(laughs)

00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:34,586
I brought you Silvana Cuerto's
stomach contents for analysis.

00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:36,388
Aw, you shouldn't have.
(laughs)

00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:41,526
So, everything okay
with Elisabetta?

00:27:41,526 --> 00:27:42,995
Yeah, uh, great.

00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:45,530
Yeah, in-in fact, uh,
she just heard from Immigration.

00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,366
Uh, they processed
our application,

00:27:47,366 --> 00:27:49,735
and, uh, because
of your help,

00:27:49,735 --> 00:27:51,436
uh, we've been approved.

00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:53,872
Wow. (laughs)

00:27:53,872 --> 00:27:56,675
Yeah.
So, what...
what does that mean?

00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:59,711
Well, uh, it means that
we have 90 days to get married,

00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:02,447
or she gets put back
on a plane home.

00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:05,317
Well, it's a good thing
you live in Vegas.

00:28:05,317 --> 00:28:07,452
You can just get hitched
at a drive-thru.

00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:09,254
(laughs)

00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:11,790
Well, don't take your foot
off the gas.

00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,592
(laughs)
Thanks.

00:28:25,237 --> 00:28:27,239
Look who's back.

00:28:27,239 --> 00:28:30,409
CSI... Russell, right?

00:28:30,409 --> 00:28:31,943
Yeah, that's right.

00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:33,545
How are you feeling?

00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,847
I don't know.

00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:37,349
What happened?

00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:39,418
Well, we're gonna
find that out.

00:28:39,418 --> 00:28:42,254
Seems somebody tried
to poison you.

00:28:42,254 --> 00:28:44,556
Like they did to Marta?

00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:47,793
Antonio told me.

00:28:47,793 --> 00:28:51,563
Well, the person who poisoned
your sister forced her

00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,799
to ingest cassava leaves.

00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:57,402
Now, clearly, that was
not the case with you, but

00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,938
do you remember if anyone
offered you any food,

00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:02,207
or something to drink
before your rehearsal?

00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:03,475
No.

00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:05,544
But I-I can't remember much.

00:29:05,544 --> 00:29:07,546
Okay.

00:29:07,546 --> 00:29:11,983
What I do remember,
I wish I could forget.

00:29:11,983 --> 00:29:16,521
I was so happy
to come here.

00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:18,557
To be a star...

00:29:18,557 --> 00:29:20,225
in this country.

00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,362
Now, Marta...

00:29:24,362 --> 00:29:26,631
Marta's dead.

00:29:28,467 --> 00:29:30,435
(voice breaking):
I should never have...

00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:36,308
Please...

00:29:36,308 --> 00:29:38,310
find who did this.

00:29:41,646 --> 00:29:43,415
Please tell me
that you have something.

00:29:43,415 --> 00:29:44,883
You know we had

00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:46,585
to let Eddie Santos go.

00:29:46,585 --> 00:29:48,553
Well, we just sprung
his nephew Estefan, as well.

00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:49,955
So I am hoping

00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:51,957
that we can tie at
least one of them

00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:53,725
to Silvana's poisoning.

00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:55,760
Well, I can tell you this much.

00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,662
Silvana Cuerto was poisoned
with cyanide

00:29:57,662 --> 00:29:59,865
by way
of unprocessed cassava leaves.

00:29:59,865 --> 00:30:01,833
So at least
our killer is consistent.

00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:03,568
Not entirely,
because in Silvana's case,

00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:04,936
he changed the method
of delivery.

00:30:04,936 --> 00:30:06,571
In addition
to the cassava leaves,

00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:09,474
I found gelatin
and plant polysaccharides.

00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,977
Which is from soluble capsules?

00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:13,812
Yes.

00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,715
So, Silvana ingested pills
filled with poison.

00:30:16,715 --> 00:30:18,383
Yes, again,
but I don't think she knew

00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:19,951
that they were
filled with poison.

00:30:19,951 --> 00:30:21,953
I suspect that she thought
they were filled with

00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:25,423
justicia pectoralis,
which I also found in the mix.

00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:27,692
It's an herbal remedy,
primarily used for relaxation.

00:30:27,692 --> 00:30:29,794
Cubans call it <i>tilo.</i>

00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:31,997
<i>Tilo.</i>
You know it?

00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:33,999
Yeah, I just saw it
on the evidence list.

00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:37,702
Greg found a bottle of it
in Silvana's dressing room.

00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:40,405
Maybe somebody who had access--
perhaps Estefan--

00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:42,507
spiked Silvana's calm pills,

00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:43,775
tried to kill her buzz.

00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:45,777
I'll get Greg to run the <i>tilo.</i>

00:30:45,777 --> 00:30:48,413
Thank you.
Pleasure.

RUSSELL:
So, Hodges confirmed
that the <i>tilo</i> capsules

00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:46,972
we found in Silvana's
dressing room

00:31:46,972 --> 00:31:48,907
contained ground-up
cassava leaves.

00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,242
Source of the cyanide.

00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:51,643
Right. Lucky for Silvana,

00:31:51,643 --> 00:31:53,778
that when you put the
poison in a capsule,

00:31:53,778 --> 00:31:55,780
it reduces
the-the potency.
All right.

00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,315
And we know the print
Greg assembled

00:31:57,315 --> 00:31:58,850
came back to Antonio Ficha.

00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:00,952
So much for him
being her handler.

00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:03,688
Looks like he's our killer,
but I-I don't... I don't get it.

00:32:03,688 --> 00:32:05,557
Well, I may have
something for you.

00:32:05,557 --> 00:32:08,493
Just got off the phone
with the State Department--

00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:10,895
Cuerto sisters
were seeking asylum.

00:32:10,895 --> 00:32:14,599
That explains
the phone call to... to DC.

00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,635
Sisters defecting,
bad news for Antonio.
All right.

00:32:16,635 --> 00:32:18,903
So what are we thinking?
That he killed Marta and then...

00:32:18,903 --> 00:32:21,406
left the warning for Silvana,
"You're next"?

00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:22,841
Obviously,
she didn't get the message.

00:32:22,841 --> 00:32:25,510
Right.
I'm on my way.

00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,279
You got something?
Yeah, Antonio Ficha

00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,581
checked Silvana out of the
hospital about a half hour ago.

00:32:29,581 --> 00:32:31,249
Where were they going?

00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:33,318
Patrol spotted them
returning to their hotel.

00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:34,819
(phone ringing)
I'm meeting Brass
over at the Palermo.

00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:36,821
Crawford.
Okay, I'm on my way.

00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:38,990
CRAWFORD:
Guy at the front desk says
Antonio and Silvana

00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,425
arrived about 20 minutes ago.

00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:41,860
Went straight up to the room.

00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:42,861
Were they alone?
They were.

00:32:42,861 --> 00:32:44,596
What do you mean
"they were"?

00:32:44,596 --> 00:32:45,930
A few minutes after that,
another guy showed up.

00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:48,500
His description
matches Estefan Mejia.

00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,968
What the hell is he doing here?
(shouting,
clattering)

00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,404
Uh-oh...
MAN: No!
(gunshot)

00:32:52,404 --> 00:32:53,905
BRASS:
LVPD!

00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:55,206
Drop the gun!
Drop the gun, Antonio!

00:32:55,206 --> 00:32:56,908
CRAWFORD:
Drop the gun!

00:32:56,908 --> 00:32:58,343
Show me your hands!

00:32:58,343 --> 00:33:00,278
Against the wall!
Come on!

00:33:02,847 --> 00:33:04,916
It's Estefan. He's dead.

00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:06,518
Silvana?

00:33:06,518 --> 00:33:08,420
(woman crying)

00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,556
It's okay.

00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:13,625
Everything's okay.
Antonio's crazy.

00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:16,461
He was going to kill me.
It's all right. It's all right.

00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:18,463
You're safe now. You're safe.

00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:19,764
It's all over.

00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:27,439
All right, what do
you got for me, David?

00:33:27,439 --> 00:33:29,841
Broken nose, bruises.

00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:32,310
Took a few shots
to the face before

00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:34,279
a single GSW to the forehead.

00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:36,581
And there's no exit wound.

00:33:36,581 --> 00:33:38,483
It's a large caliber,

00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:40,618
consistent with a .45.

00:33:40,618 --> 00:33:41,886
Check this out.

00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:45,623
(groans)
It's a compound

00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:47,459
fracture of the
right index finger.

00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:48,893
That's the trigger finger.

00:33:48,893 --> 00:33:51,262
Antonio must've wrenched
the gun out of his hand.

00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:58,370
Hey, Morgan...

00:33:59,571 --> 00:34:00,572
...take a look at this.

00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:07,212
Seen that before.

00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:08,880
In Silvana's dressing room.

00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,583
Yeah. Killer used
the burlap sack

00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:13,785
to transport Marta's body with.

00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:15,253
But what's it doing here?

00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:16,855
(ventilation whirrs, whooshes)

00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:28,233
Hey, guys, look what I found.

00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:32,937
BRODY:
Antonio's bag.

00:34:32,937 --> 00:34:34,372
Yeah.

00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:35,507
With blood on it.

00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:44,916
It's like a regular murder kit.

00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,751
What do we have here?

00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:52,490
I'm guessing
those are cassava leaves.

00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:53,958
It happened so fast.

00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:55,560
Estefan pushed his way
into the room.

00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,928
Then he and Antonio
started to argue.

00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,930
What were they arguing about?

00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:01,266
He said Antonio
had murdered Marta,

00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:02,934
tried to poison me
and that he wouldn't let

00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,702
Antonio hurt me again.

00:35:04,702 --> 00:35:06,237
What made Estefan think

00:35:06,237 --> 00:35:08,239
that Antonio was the one
behind it all?

00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:09,574
He said his uncle told him.

00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:11,576
When Estefan
pulled out a gun,

00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:13,912
I ran into the bathroom to hide.

00:35:13,912 --> 00:35:16,247
Then I heard a shot.

00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:18,850
And I was sure
he'd killed Antonio.

00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,718
Then the police arrived,

00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:23,721
and I saw Estefan
lying on the floor.

00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:26,391
He was just trying
to protect me.

00:35:26,391 --> 00:35:28,593
You're gonna be all right.

00:35:28,593 --> 00:35:30,762
I think we should get you to
the hospital, just to make sure.

00:35:30,762 --> 00:35:31,863
No, I don't want to go
to the hospital.

00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:36,301
I just want to go home.

00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:37,635
Silvana's returning to Cuba.

00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:38,903
And so am I.

00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:40,238
You have no right
to hold me here.

00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:41,773
I've done nothing wrong.

00:35:41,773 --> 00:35:44,409
Antonio, we walked in on you
standing over Estefan Mejia

00:35:44,409 --> 00:35:46,311
with a gun in your hand.

00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:47,946
Yeah, man, I think the
gun was still smoking.

00:35:47,946 --> 00:35:49,614
That was in self-defense.

00:35:49,614 --> 00:35:50,982
Mm.

00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,750
Silvana and I were packing
our bags when...

00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:54,686
Estefan showed up.

00:35:54,686 --> 00:35:56,788
I tried to reason with him,
but his head was filled with...

00:35:56,788 --> 00:35:58,890
lies.

00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:00,792
You son of a bitch!
I know what you've done!
<i>Oye, tranquilo!</i>

00:36:00,792 --> 00:36:01,993
<i>Tranquilo! Cálmate!</i>

00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:03,795
You killed Marta!
You poisoned Silvana!

00:36:03,795 --> 00:36:05,530
What are you talking about?!
That was your crazy uncle.

00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:06,965
Not me! I am the one
protecting Silvana,

00:36:06,965 --> 00:36:08,500
and I'm taking her home.

00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,667
No, you're not going anywhere!

00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:10,668
No, no, no! Ooh!

00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:12,904
(speaks Spanish)

00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:15,473
(grunting)

00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:18,209
(shouts, grunts)

00:36:19,878 --> 00:36:22,213
Now you get the
hell out of here.

00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:22,947
No!

00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:27,252
Estefan gave me no choice.

00:36:27,252 --> 00:36:29,320
STOKES: Let's say I buy
self-defense.

00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,389
We still found your fingerprints

00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:34,325
on Silvana's <i>tilo</i> capsules.

00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:36,761
They were filled with cyanide.

00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:40,798
So you think I poisoned Silvana?

00:36:40,798 --> 00:36:43,268
Why would I do
such a thing?

00:36:43,268 --> 00:36:45,203
She's Cuba's gift to the world.

00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,704
Gift to the U.S.,
you mean.

00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:49,641
She and Marta
wanted to defect.

00:36:49,641 --> 00:36:51,409
But you weren't
gonna let that happen.

00:36:53,344 --> 00:36:55,780
(over speaker): I don't know
what you're talking about.

00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:56,781
He's lying.

00:36:56,781 --> 00:36:58,950
Maybe.

00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:01,219
(over speaker):
And I don't know anything
about any poisoned pills.

00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:03,421
I gave Silvana my <i>tilo</i> to calm
her down after Marta's death.

00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:05,456
I guess you don't know anything
about this bag.

00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:07,592
Same one with your name on it.

00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:09,661
CRAWFORD: It also has
Marta's blood on it.

00:37:09,661 --> 00:37:11,262
And that's the same kind
of rope you used

00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:13,464
to tie her up with.
STOKES:
And the fiber

00:37:13,464 --> 00:37:16,301
is a match to the same
burlap sack used

00:37:16,301 --> 00:37:18,603
to transport her
to the Rumbason

00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:20,438
from Eddie Santos's
auto body shop.

00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:21,573
CRAWFORD:
You've been trying
to frame

00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:23,408
Eddie Santos from day one.

00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:25,710
No. I am the one
being framed here.

00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:26,644
Don't you see?

00:37:29,814 --> 00:37:31,349
I thought justice
in your country

00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:32,717
wasn't about what you believe.

00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:34,919
It's about what you can prove.

00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,721
No?

00:37:36,721 --> 00:37:38,656
What can we prove?

00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:40,491
We're running everything
right now.

00:37:40,491 --> 00:37:41,793
State Department's
all over this.

00:37:41,793 --> 00:37:42,894
We can't afford any mistakes.

00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:45,997
Well, neither can he.

00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,668
HODGES:
<i>Hey, boss.</i>

00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:52,637
I've got confirmation of
our preliminary results.

00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:56,374
Blood on Antonio Ficha's duffel
bag matches Marta Cuerto.

00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:58,409
That's good.
And the fibers

00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:01,779
that we found from the burlap
sack match the burlap sack

00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:04,749
that the killer used
to move the body.
Also good.

00:38:04,749 --> 00:38:08,753
The rope, the cassava leaves
are all consistent.
But?

00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:12,290
But Henry couldn't recover
any DNA from the gloves.

00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:15,460
And I found this little mystery
in the duffel.

00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,261
What's this?

00:38:17,261 --> 00:38:18,763
Mouton.

00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:22,467
Lambskin. With a particular
acrylic dye recipe

00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:25,269
commonly used in the restoration
of classic American cars.

00:38:25,269 --> 00:38:27,705
Which you're thinking the killer
used to transport the body.

00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:29,941
HODGES:
Yes. And according to the fiber,

00:38:29,941 --> 00:38:31,609
we should be looking
in the trunk

00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:33,544
of a 1956 Chevrolet Bel Air.

00:38:33,544 --> 00:38:36,347
Oh. Now, that's the same car
that Eddie Santos drives.

00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:38,449
I went there, too.
There's just one problem.

00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:41,419
I processed Eddie's Chevy
while he was in custody,

00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:44,355
and his car hasn't seen
a carpet upgrade since 1956.

00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:46,457
Oh. Well, that's not good.

00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:49,227
HODGES:
Of course, Eddie has a stable
of classic cars.

00:38:49,227 --> 00:38:49,961
Could be one of them.

00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:56,467
Or the car, like our killer,

00:38:56,467 --> 00:38:58,302
could've been staring us
in the face

00:38:58,302 --> 00:38:59,804
<i>the whole time.</i>

00:38:59,804 --> 00:39:02,974
I checked with Sunstar
Auto Rental.

00:39:02,974 --> 00:39:07,712
They said they wrote a two-day
contract on this '56 Chevy

00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:10,448
for Antonio
for-for your photo shoot.

00:39:10,448 --> 00:39:13,551
But the kid behind the desk said
that he was such a big fan,

00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:16,421
that when you came back
to rent it for an extra day,

00:39:16,421 --> 00:39:18,356
he gave it
to you for free.

00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:19,557
Off the books.

00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:21,325
I guess...

00:39:21,325 --> 00:39:25,530
like me, he was won over
by your-your beautiful voice,

00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:28,666
your warm heart,
your... trusting face.

00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:30,735
Anyway...

00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:32,737
he said something else
that was very interesting.

00:39:32,737 --> 00:39:35,673
He said that he wasn't used to
having people return vehicles

00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:37,842
cleaner than when they drove
them off the lot.

00:39:39,844 --> 00:39:41,679
Silvana...

00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:44,215
I know you did it.

00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,650
I know you killed your sister.

00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:48,319
I loved my sister.
I don't doubt that.

00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:51,856
Because, in my experience,
a brutal murder like Marta's

00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:54,792
can only come
from deep emotions.

00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:57,395
Love turned to hate
through betrayal.

00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,731
You don't even know
what you're talking about.

00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:01,265
Actually, I do.

00:40:01,265 --> 00:40:03,367
Let me back up a second.

00:40:03,367 --> 00:40:06,337
Estefan brought you
and your sister here,

00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:09,841
but it was Marta who contacted
the State Department.

00:40:09,841 --> 00:40:11,375
So that you

00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:13,711
could have a career
in this country.

00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:17,548
But more importantly,
so she could be near Estefan.

00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:20,318
But you wanted Estefan
for yourself, didn't you?

00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:23,554
You loved him.
Ever since you were kids.

00:40:23,554 --> 00:40:26,324
And the more you loved him,
the more you hated your sister.

00:40:26,324 --> 00:40:29,460
You're forgetting I'm the victim
of Antonio's betrayal.

00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,895
Well, it does
look like that.

00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:32,697
Because you made it
look like that.

00:40:32,697 --> 00:40:35,299
Antonio's bag, incriminating.

00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:39,470
Antonio's <i>tilo</i> pills, poisoned
just enough to make you sick

00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,539
but not enough
to kill you.
These are lies.

00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:43,274
These are all lies!

00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,276
Why can't you see the truth?
You know, actually,

00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:47,378
I-I heard the truth, Silvana.

00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:53,584
Because you've already given us
your confession, haven't you?

00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:55,853
(Silvana's melancholy
love ballad plays)

00:41:00,558 --> 00:41:03,227
All this time,
listening to these lyrics

00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:04,829
but not really hearing them.

00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:06,964
These words of-of love,

00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:11,269
loss, revenge...

00:41:11,269 --> 00:41:12,670
redemption.

00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:18,409
No matter what she's done,
she still believes

00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:20,511
that her lover will forgive her.

00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:22,313
Come to rescue her.

00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:25,349
Just like you believed
when you called Estefan,

00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:27,518
and begged him to come
to the hotel to rescue you.

00:41:27,518 --> 00:41:29,520
But Antonio was trying
to kill me.

00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,922
No, you murdered your sister,

00:41:30,922 --> 00:41:32,590
and you told Estefan

00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:34,759
that Antonio did it.

00:41:34,759 --> 00:41:38,229
You do realize, don't you, that
your lies got Estefan killed?

00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:43,634
Marta knew how much
I loved Estefan.

00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:46,437
Since we were children.

00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:49,640
Every song I wrote
was about him.

00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:52,543
She should have never
come between us!

00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:55,980
<i>Forced me to punish her</i>
<i>for what she took from me.</i>

00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:59,650
<i>I beat her. I killed her!</i>

00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:02,920
And I would do it again if that
would bring Estefan back!

00:42:04,922 --> 00:42:07,525
You tried to tell me
that you should never

00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:08,693
have come to this country.

00:42:10,795 --> 00:42:12,597
You're right.

00:42:12,597 --> 00:42:15,933
Unlike your song, Silvana,

00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:18,302
you'll find no redemption here.
