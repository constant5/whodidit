00:00:08,502 --> 00:00:10,872
(crowd applauding)

00:00:10,872 --> 00:00:14,809
(woman grunts and screams;
sharp impacts echoing)

00:00:14,809 --> 00:00:17,245
CHRIS EVERT:
What an incredible
turn of events

00:00:17,245 --> 00:00:19,280
in this women's
semi-final match.

00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,516
Second seed Tara Janssen is
struggling to stay alive

00:00:22,516 --> 00:00:25,453
in this match against
18th seed Claudia Weber.

00:00:25,453 --> 00:00:27,922
LINDSAY DAVENPORT:
Well, Weber's not
just any opponent.

00:00:27,922 --> 00:00:29,757
These two, very close
friends off the court.

00:00:29,757 --> 00:00:31,292
I know what it's like
to play

00:00:31,292 --> 00:00:33,027
against a friend,
and it's not easy.

00:00:33,027 --> 00:00:35,162
It's a difficult proposition
for both these players.

00:00:35,162 --> 00:00:36,197
Weber to serve.

00:00:43,971 --> 00:00:46,240
A huge Janssen forehand.

00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,808
Weber's getting to every ball.

00:00:47,808 --> 00:00:52,813
(crowd cheers, applauds)

00:00:52,813 --> 00:00:54,849
CHAIR UMPIRE:
40-15.

00:00:54,849 --> 00:00:57,985
DAVENPORT:
Incredible rally ends
with the easy unforced error

00:00:57,985 --> 00:00:59,353
from Janssen.

00:00:59,353 --> 00:01:01,088
Weber, now with her
first match point.

00:01:01,088 --> 00:01:03,190
You know, Lindsay, Weber
has never beaten Janssen.

00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:04,992
And this would be an
incredible win for her.

00:01:04,992 --> 00:01:07,495
Oh, biggest match
of her career.

00:01:07,495 --> 00:01:09,430
Claudia's husband
and coach, Ivan,

00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:11,432
looks as nervous as
she does right now.

00:01:11,432 --> 00:01:13,467
And her father, also,
who's cheering her on.

00:01:13,467 --> 00:01:15,336
You know, he's never
missed a match

00:01:15,336 --> 00:01:16,971
since she's been
12 years old.

00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:22,376
CHAIR UMPIRE:
Let.

00:01:22,376 --> 00:01:23,778
DAVENPORT:
Uh-oh.

00:01:23,778 --> 00:01:25,279
A little tight there
on that first serve.

00:01:25,279 --> 00:01:26,747
Nerves, maybe?

00:01:47,201 --> 00:01:49,804
CHAIR UMPIRE:
Game, match, Weber.

00:01:49,804 --> 00:01:51,305
(crowd cheers, applauds)

00:01:51,305 --> 00:01:53,174
DAVENPORT:
What a way to end it.

00:01:53,174 --> 00:01:55,910
120-mile-per-hour
ace to seal it.

00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:58,479
EVERT:
Wow, and Claudia
Weber now advances

00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,515
to her first-ever
premiere final.

00:02:05,386 --> 00:02:07,955
Claudia, congratulations
on an incredible win

00:02:07,955 --> 00:02:09,523
in front of
your hometown crowd.

00:02:09,523 --> 00:02:11,359
Is it even more
challenging playing against

00:02:11,359 --> 00:02:14,795
one of your best friends
and doubles partners?

00:02:14,795 --> 00:02:17,498
She's an incredible
competitor.

00:02:17,498 --> 00:02:20,468
That's what makes her
a great doubles partner.

00:02:20,468 --> 00:02:24,071
Oh, and I want to thank
my husband and my Dad

00:02:24,071 --> 00:02:25,806
for believing in me.

00:02:25,806 --> 00:02:28,743
And to all of you,
who cheered me on.

00:02:28,743 --> 00:02:29,810
Thank you.

00:02:30,945 --> 00:02:33,014
Thank you.

00:02:40,087 --> 00:02:42,256
Mm, gosh, what a shame.

00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:47,361
Did you ever
see Claudia Weber play?

00:02:47,361 --> 00:02:49,263
No, I never did.

00:02:49,263 --> 00:02:51,098
More of a
basketball fan, really.

00:02:51,098 --> 00:02:52,466
Mm, she was such
a great player.

00:02:52,466 --> 00:02:54,869
And a really good
person off the court.

00:02:54,869 --> 00:02:56,837
You sound like a real fan.

00:02:56,837 --> 00:02:58,439
AKERS:
CSIs Russell and Finlay,

00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:00,207
meet Justin Gimelstob.

00:03:00,207 --> 00:03:02,209
He's the one who found
the body this morning.

00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:05,179
Want to tell us
how you found her, please?

00:03:05,179 --> 00:03:06,947
Just going through
my normal routine,

00:03:06,947 --> 00:03:08,849
trying to get
a light workout in,

00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:10,317
hit some balls against
the ball machine.

00:03:14,255 --> 00:03:15,990
And I called the police.

00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:18,192
We're going to need
your clothes for evidence.

00:03:18,192 --> 00:03:20,494
I'll escort you
to the locker room.

00:03:20,494 --> 00:03:21,462
RUSSELL:
Thank you.

00:03:28,436 --> 00:03:30,371
FINLAY:
Clay's been disturbed.

00:03:33,908 --> 00:03:35,409
Medium force spatter.

00:03:41,949 --> 00:03:43,884
Claudia was
definitely killed here.

00:03:43,884 --> 00:03:47,354

Ready?
Mm-hmm.

00:04:28,896 --> 00:04:30,531
(groans, sighs)

00:04:30,531 --> 00:04:32,800
Wow, her right arm

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,135
is quite a bit
bigger than her left.

00:04:34,135 --> 00:04:35,903
Well, that's typical
of tennis players.

00:04:35,903 --> 00:04:37,438
Their hitting arm's
often more muscular.

00:04:37,438 --> 00:04:39,206
You a tennis fan?

00:04:39,206 --> 00:04:41,442
Yeah, my, uh, doubles
partner and I are the top-ranked

00:04:41,442 --> 00:04:43,978
wheelchair team
at our club.

00:04:43,978 --> 00:04:46,413
Liver temp. is 89.5.

00:04:46,413 --> 00:04:48,349
Puts TOD at less than six hours.

00:04:49,783 --> 00:04:51,085
Shouldn't it be 12 hours?

00:04:51,085 --> 00:04:52,386
She's in full rigor.

00:04:52,386 --> 00:04:53,954
Physical activity
so close to death

00:04:53,954 --> 00:04:56,390
sometimes causes
the body to go into rigor

00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,025
a little faster than normal.

00:04:58,025 --> 00:05:00,161
Got a spatter
pattern on her shoe.

00:05:00,161 --> 00:05:02,530
Clay mixed in,
so I can't really

00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,398
tell if it's blood.

00:05:04,398 --> 00:05:06,133
Serious blunt-force
trauma to the head.

00:05:06,133 --> 00:05:07,968
She may have
won the match,

00:05:07,968 --> 00:05:09,303
but she took a beating
on the court.

00:05:10,804 --> 00:05:12,973
Ms. Weber
was not only beaten,

00:05:12,973 --> 00:05:15,943
she was stabbed in
the throat, too.

00:05:15,943 --> 00:05:17,845
Wasn't there
another tennis player

00:05:17,845 --> 00:05:19,513
who got stabbed on
the court years ago?

00:05:19,513 --> 00:05:21,282
Yeah, Monica Seles.

00:05:21,282 --> 00:05:24,285
By an obsessed
Steffi Graff fan.
Right.

00:05:24,285 --> 00:05:26,353
Sports fans can be
extremely passionate.

00:05:26,353 --> 00:05:28,289
Maybe someone was not happy

00:05:28,289 --> 00:05:30,057
that Claudia won
that match yesterday.

00:05:34,528 --> 00:05:37,398
Why are you treating
me like a suspect?

00:05:37,398 --> 00:05:39,366
My wife just died.

00:05:39,366 --> 00:05:41,335
I understand that.

00:05:41,335 --> 00:05:43,370
But if anything, we're
doing everything we can

00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:44,505
to eliminate you
as a suspect.

00:05:46,407 --> 00:05:48,342
When's the last time
you saw Claudia?

00:05:48,342 --> 00:05:50,911
Uh, right after her match.

00:05:50,911 --> 00:05:52,846
I stayed for her
press conference,

00:05:52,846 --> 00:05:54,381
then I went home.

00:05:54,381 --> 00:05:56,984
You know, her car was
still in the parking lot.

00:05:56,984 --> 00:05:58,419
Were you worried
when she didn't

00:05:58,419 --> 00:06:00,020
come home last night?

00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,956
She booked a room in a
hotel across the street.

00:06:04,792 --> 00:06:08,229
My snoring, uh, keeps
her up at night.

00:06:08,229 --> 00:06:11,031
And she wanted to get a good
night's rest before the final.

00:06:11,031 --> 00:06:13,767
She was on that court
really late last night.

00:06:13,767 --> 00:06:15,803
Does she normally stay
after hours like that?

00:06:15,803 --> 00:06:18,439
She liked to hit balls
after a big match at night.

00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:20,040
It would clear her head.

00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,842
So anybody in
the tennis world

00:06:21,842 --> 00:06:24,044
would understand that's...
that's part of her routine?

00:06:24,044 --> 00:06:26,880
Athletes, they're--
they're creatures of habit.

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,950
Do you know of anyone who
would want to hurt your wife?

00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:32,386
Everyone loved Claudia.

00:06:34,288 --> 00:06:35,289
Okay, man.

00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:41,262
The hardest part
is telling her dad.

00:06:41,262 --> 00:06:44,131
He just lost his
wife last year.

00:06:44,131 --> 00:06:47,134
Claudia's... she was
all he had left.

00:06:47,134 --> 00:06:48,469
I'm going to do
everything I can

00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:50,170
to find out who did
this, all right?

00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:55,442
Check out these scuff marks.

00:06:56,944 --> 00:06:59,013
Ms. Weber struggled
with her killer.

00:07:00,281 --> 00:07:02,182
(grunting)

00:07:05,185 --> 00:07:06,787
FINLAY:
Got more blood drops.

00:07:11,325 --> 00:07:14,228
Some grass,
little pieces of gravel.

00:07:14,228 --> 00:07:16,130
Could've come
from the killer's shoes.

00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:18,465
All right, I'll collect
this section of the clay,

00:07:18,465 --> 00:07:20,267
and then I'll bring
it back to the lab.

00:07:33,414 --> 00:07:36,450
SANDERS: I got more blood drops,
leading to the garbage can.

00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:38,485
Killer could've tried to
dispose of the weapon.

00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,990
It's empty;
the bag's been changed.

00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:46,260
Well, looks like
I'm going Dumpster diving.

00:07:54,201 --> 00:07:56,036
AGENT: Excuse me,
are you CSI Supervisor

00:07:56,036 --> 00:07:57,404
Diebekorn Russell?

00:07:57,404 --> 00:07:59,306
Judging by the suit,
I'm guessing you're

00:07:59,306 --> 00:08:00,507
a government agent.

00:08:00,507 --> 00:08:02,109
And, if you're DEA,

00:08:02,109 --> 00:08:04,445
the mushrooms behind
me are medicinal.

00:08:04,445 --> 00:08:06,480
I've been through this
before with you guys.

00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,849
I'm not here about
your mushrooms, sir.

00:08:08,849 --> 00:08:10,884
Agent Smith, USCIS.

00:08:10,884 --> 00:08:12,086
Immigration.

00:08:12,086 --> 00:08:14,088
All right.
What's that about?

00:08:14,088 --> 00:08:16,056
One of your employees,
David Hodges.

00:08:16,056 --> 00:08:18,392
David? He's an
American citizen.

00:08:18,392 --> 00:08:22,029
He's got family in Canada,
yeah, but, I mean, who doesn't?

00:08:22,029 --> 00:08:23,931
How would you describe
Mr. Hodges' character?

00:08:23,931 --> 00:08:26,734
A little odd,
but nice, hardworking.

00:08:26,734 --> 00:08:27,901
To the best of
your knowledge,

00:08:27,901 --> 00:08:29,203
has he ever
been dishonest?

00:08:29,203 --> 00:08:31,071
No.
Never falsified
reports?

00:08:31,071 --> 00:08:34,208
Tampered with evidence?
No, no, absolutely not.

00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:36,410
Does he travel
internationally a lot?

00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:38,879
Not that you'd
notice, no.

00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:43,083
Well, wait, no, he took
his mom to Italy last year.

00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:45,219
Is Hodges in some
kind of trouble?

00:08:48,188 --> 00:08:49,823
You recognize
that woman?

00:08:49,823 --> 00:08:51,191
No, should I?

00:08:51,191 --> 00:08:53,861
David Hodges claims
she's his fiancée.

00:08:53,861 --> 00:08:56,330
HODGES:
<i>Her name is Elisabetta.</i>

00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:59,833
We met at her family's
vineyard in Tuscany.

00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:02,302
She educated me about
the acidic properties

00:09:02,302 --> 00:09:03,904
of the Sangiovese grape.

00:09:03,904 --> 00:09:05,973
Sounds romantic.
It was <i>amore.</i>

00:09:05,973 --> 00:09:07,474
I knew then that
we were destined

00:09:07,474 --> 00:09:09,309
to spend our
lives together.

00:09:09,309 --> 00:09:11,945
Well, I-I certainly hope that
Immigration agrees with you.

00:09:14,381 --> 00:09:18,752
Did the agent happen to seem
overly suspicious?

00:09:18,752 --> 00:09:20,287
Raised a red flag, yeah,

00:09:20,287 --> 00:09:22,256
when I-I didn't
recognize Eli-Eli...

00:09:22,256 --> 00:09:23,490
Elisabetta.

00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:26,326
Why-why didn't
you tell anyone?

00:09:26,326 --> 00:09:27,861
Um, what can I say?

00:09:27,861 --> 00:09:30,030
I'm a man of mystery.

00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:32,332
Yeah, okay.

00:09:32,332 --> 00:09:34,968
Um, hey,
very happy for you.

00:09:34,968 --> 00:09:36,970
Congratulations.
Well, thank you.

00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:39,173
I'm going to let you
get back to your clay.

00:09:39,173 --> 00:09:41,375
You know, technically,
it's not clay.

00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,210
American courts
use crushed basalt.

00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:45,813
Ah, see, I didn't know that.
That's fascinating.

00:09:45,813 --> 00:09:48,248
Okay, good, um...

Broken wrist, stress

Come look at this.

00:10:01,995 --> 00:10:05,432
Brown discoloration of
the cerebral cortex

00:10:05,432 --> 00:10:08,135
adjacent to brown
discoloration of the subdura--

00:10:08,135 --> 00:10:11,505
indicative of previous
head trauma, likely a contusion.

00:10:11,505 --> 00:10:13,106
How long ago?

00:10:13,106 --> 00:10:14,374
No way to
know for sure.

00:10:14,374 --> 00:10:16,376
What about her
current injuries?

00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:20,481
Three depressed skull fractures

00:10:20,481 --> 00:10:22,382
that left rectangular
impressions

00:10:22,382 --> 00:10:25,886
approximately one inch wide.

00:10:25,886 --> 00:10:27,221
Is that the
cause of death?

00:10:27,221 --> 00:10:29,289
No, actually this was:

00:10:29,289 --> 00:10:32,159
this vertical fracture bisected
the thyroid prominence

00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:34,061
and fractured
both superior horns,

00:10:34,061 --> 00:10:35,996
causing a
soft tissue hemorrhage.

00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:45,806
She choked on her own blood.

00:10:45,806 --> 00:10:47,474
Essentially, yes.

00:10:47,474 --> 00:10:49,376
Any idea what the
murder weapon is yet?

00:10:49,376 --> 00:10:52,012
Well, the margins of
the wound are jagged

00:10:52,012 --> 00:10:53,847
and the puncture's
less than an inch deep.

00:10:53,847 --> 00:10:56,383
Doesn't appear to be a knife,
but at this point,

00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,918
I can't say for
certain what it was.

00:11:00,487 --> 00:11:02,356
So, Ernest, what
time did you

00:11:02,356 --> 00:11:04,525
change the trash
bags on that court?

00:11:04,525 --> 00:11:07,861
Uh, start of my shift,

You, uh, see anything
unusual in there?

00:11:10,964 --> 00:11:12,733
I don't look in the bags,

00:11:12,733 --> 00:11:15,202
not since a player on the court
had food poisoning.

00:11:15,202 --> 00:11:17,004
Bags were full of puke.

00:11:17,004 --> 00:11:18,338
Oh, well, that's great.

00:11:18,338 --> 00:11:20,207

So, it's definitely
the murder weapon.

00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:39,279

How could you
possibly think

00:14:24,257 --> 00:14:25,926
that I'd do anything
to hurt her?

00:14:25,926 --> 00:14:28,328
Because your DNA
was on her tennis racket,

00:14:28,328 --> 00:14:31,264
which just so happens
to be the murder weapon.

00:14:31,264 --> 00:14:32,399
Let me show you.

00:14:34,067 --> 00:14:36,870
Claudia and I both used
the Ace-Trak 528 racket.

00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,505
A couple of times,
when we were

00:14:38,505 --> 00:14:42,375
playing doubles, we grabbed
each other's by mistake.

00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:44,978
Okay.

00:14:44,978 --> 00:14:47,013
Ms. Janssen,
let me ask you something.

00:14:47,013 --> 00:14:49,182
What's the prize money
on these kind of tournaments?

00:14:49,182 --> 00:14:50,350
Half a million.

00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:52,085
That's a good
chunk of change.

00:14:52,085 --> 00:14:54,121
So when Claudia knocked you
out of the tournament,

00:14:54,121 --> 00:14:56,123
you obviously lost
your shot at the cash.

00:14:56,123 --> 00:14:57,958
I'm not interested
in the prize money.

00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:00,427
I made $11 million in
endorsement deals last year.

00:15:00,427 --> 00:15:03,530
So you do it for the glory;
for the love of the game.

00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:05,165
I'm chasing history.

00:15:05,165 --> 00:15:06,399
17 more wins,
and I'll break the record

00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,268
for most career
singles titles.

00:15:08,268 --> 00:15:11,505
But, you know, let's face it,
I mean, you're pushing 30.

00:15:11,505 --> 00:15:14,775
I mean, that's not old,
but in tennis, that's old.

00:15:14,775 --> 00:15:17,244
And young up-and-comers like
Claudia could get in the way

00:15:17,244 --> 00:15:19,079
of you chasing
your legacy, right?

00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:23,216
Listen, no one likes to lose,
but... she deserved to win.

00:15:23,216 --> 00:15:24,885
She played a
great match.

00:15:24,885 --> 00:15:26,186
And I was happy for her.

00:15:26,186 --> 00:15:28,989
You weren't always
such a gracious loser.

00:16:11,264 --> 00:16:12,866

for a moment?

So what was your
relationship with Tara?

00:16:30,817 --> 00:16:33,153
Well, she's been getting
some code violations lately,

00:16:33,153 --> 00:16:36,456
and I'm really trying to help
her with her anger issues.

00:16:36,456 --> 00:16:38,792

time you saw her?

00:16:38,792 --> 00:16:42,062
Last night,
after her match.

00:16:42,062 --> 00:16:44,064
We were just chatting
about her game.

00:16:44,064 --> 00:16:46,533
Grabbed a bite, and then I just
dropped her off at her condo.

00:16:46,533 --> 00:16:49,970
What time was that?
A little before midnight.

00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:53,473
Did Claudia Weber have any
issues with anybody on the tour?

00:16:53,473 --> 00:16:56,376
No, not the players.

00:16:56,376 --> 00:16:59,779
But she hasn't been too happy
about her coach lately.

00:16:59,779 --> 00:17:02,315
Is that her husband Ivan?

00:17:02,315 --> 00:17:05,118
Yeah. She actually has been
thinking about firing him.

00:17:05,118 --> 00:17:06,887

00:17:06,887 --> 00:17:09,890

00:18:24,965 --> 00:18:27,200
<i>Qualche bionda</i>
<i>bimbo Americana?</i>

00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,435
No, wait...

00:18:28,435 --> 00:18:29,803
Oh, she thinks
there's another woman.

00:18:29,803 --> 00:18:31,204
Yeah, I got that.

00:18:31,204 --> 00:18:35,308
Elisabetta...
there is only you.

00:18:35,308 --> 00:18:36,876
<i>Sei l'unica donna...</i>

00:18:38,845 --> 00:18:40,981
<i>...che amo.</i>

00:18:44,017 --> 00:18:46,386
(speaks Italian)

00:18:46,386 --> 00:18:48,321
You drive me crazy,
David, you know that?

00:18:49,823 --> 00:18:51,458
I love you.

00:18:55,795 --> 00:18:59,499
I have never been jealous
of Hodges until this moment.

00:18:59,499 --> 00:19:00,934
Mm-hmm, yeah.

00:19:02,268 --> 00:19:03,503
Wha...?
(camera clicks)

00:19:06,172 --> 00:19:09,309
Now everybody knows
who I am.

00:19:11,778 --> 00:19:13,446
(man)
Way to go, Hodges!

00:19:13,446 --> 00:19:15,015
You have something
for me, right?

00:19:15,015 --> 00:19:16,750
Yes...

00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:21,054
Uh, Hodges found traces of
chewing tobacco in the clay.

00:19:21,054 --> 00:19:24,124
It's the same trace that Finn
pulled off the victim's shoes.

00:19:24,124 --> 00:19:26,960
Guess who the DNA
comes back to.

00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,063
Why'd you lie to me, Ivan?

00:19:30,063 --> 00:19:31,164
What do you mean?

00:19:31,164 --> 00:19:32,899
You know as well as I do

00:19:32,899 --> 00:19:35,068
you were on that practice court
with Claudia last night.

00:19:35,068 --> 00:19:36,936
BRODY: Chewing tobacco
is a dirty habit.

00:19:36,936 --> 00:19:41,441
When you spit, you got some
on your wife's shoes.

00:19:41,441 --> 00:19:43,843
We have DNA to prove
it's yours.

00:19:43,843 --> 00:19:46,813
We know Claudia was shopping
around for a new coach.

00:19:46,813 --> 00:19:49,282
You were about to be fired
by your wife.

00:19:49,282 --> 00:19:50,817
That's got to be

00:19:50,817 --> 00:19:52,485
a serious blow
to the ego, man.

00:19:52,485 --> 00:19:54,254
You couldn't
handle it,

00:19:54,254 --> 00:19:55,288
so you killed her.

00:19:55,288 --> 00:19:57,424
No! No.

00:19:59,492 --> 00:20:01,294
I went there
to talk to her.

00:20:02,896 --> 00:20:04,431
You just had the best game
of your career,

00:20:04,431 --> 00:20:06,099
and you want to fire me?

00:20:06,099 --> 00:20:07,867
I can't take orders
from you on the court

00:20:07,867 --> 00:20:09,202
and then come home
to you at night.

00:20:09,202 --> 00:20:10,937
It's too hard.
So, that's it?

00:20:10,937 --> 00:20:12,806
You're just gonna
get rid of me, huh? I'm gone.

00:20:12,806 --> 00:20:16,943
If we want to try
and make this marriage work,

00:20:16,943 --> 00:20:19,913
you can't be my
husband and my coach.

00:20:19,913 --> 00:20:23,083
I agreed to do whatever it
took to save our marriage.

00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:24,951
And how long had you two
been having trouble?

00:20:24,951 --> 00:20:28,188
About a year.

00:20:28,188 --> 00:20:32,192
The last month had been
the worst. Uh...

00:20:32,192 --> 00:20:34,127
She hadn't been herself.

00:20:34,127 --> 00:20:35,395
What do you mean?

00:20:35,395 --> 00:20:36,930
She'd been having
nightmares.

00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:39,065
She was calling out
some guy's name.

00:20:39,065 --> 00:20:40,233
Brent.

00:20:40,233 --> 00:20:41,901
Is that somebody on tour?

00:20:41,901 --> 00:20:43,470
Not that I know of.

00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:45,438
When I asked her about it,
she wouldn't tell me.

00:20:47,507 --> 00:20:49,776
She'd been kind of
secretive lately.

00:20:49,776 --> 00:20:52,479
Is it possible that your wife
was having an affair?

00:20:52,479 --> 00:20:55,115
I don't think so.

00:20:55,115 --> 00:20:59,819
Claudia was the most honest,
decent person that I ever met.

00:21:05,492 --> 00:21:07,794
Hey. This is the last
of what was collected

00:21:07,794 --> 00:21:09,529
from Claudia
Weber's locker.

00:21:12,765 --> 00:21:15,068
Cat treats...

00:21:15,068 --> 00:21:17,370
three different kinds
of hand lotion.

00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:20,206
Learn a lot about a woman from
what she keeps in her purse.

00:21:20,206 --> 00:21:22,008
Same goes for
her tennis bag.

00:21:22,008 --> 00:21:23,476
Oh, what's this
thing called?

00:21:23,476 --> 00:21:25,311
A Blossom Ballerina?

00:21:25,311 --> 00:21:27,447
Oh, yeah.
My daughter had one of those.

00:21:27,447 --> 00:21:28,815
Took it everywhere.

00:21:28,815 --> 00:21:30,483
Athletes tend to
be superstitious.

00:21:30,483 --> 00:21:32,352
Maybe it was a
good luck charm.

00:21:32,352 --> 00:21:34,487
Receipts from Tasty Time
and Choozies Chicken.

00:21:34,487 --> 00:21:37,157
Well, players burn
a lot of calories,

00:21:37,157 --> 00:21:39,492
and fast food is an easy
way to replace them.

00:21:39,492 --> 00:21:41,027
Their dirty little secret.

00:21:41,027 --> 00:21:43,396
She might have
another secret, too.

00:21:43,396 --> 00:21:45,465
This looks like LSD.

00:21:45,465 --> 00:21:47,433
(laughs)

00:21:47,433 --> 00:21:49,102
Man, that takes me back.

00:21:49,102 --> 00:21:51,504
Wait, you took LSD?

00:21:51,504 --> 00:21:53,106
No.

00:21:53,106 --> 00:21:54,807
No, my folks did.

00:21:56,109 --> 00:21:59,879
Hey, wasn't illegal
until 1966.

00:21:59,879 --> 00:22:01,381
Okay.

00:22:01,381 --> 00:22:03,316
But Claudia Weber's
tox was clean.

00:22:03,316 --> 00:22:05,518
And as you know, or your
folks, should know...

00:22:05,518 --> 00:22:07,420
(chuckles)
LSD doesn't
stay in your system

00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:09,355
for more than a half an hour.

00:22:09,355 --> 00:22:10,857
You know, her husband thought

00:22:10,857 --> 00:22:12,992
that she was keeping
a secret from him.

00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:14,994
This would be quite a doozy.

00:22:14,994 --> 00:22:17,530
But LSD isn't a
performance enhancer.

00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:19,265
It's recreational.

00:22:19,265 --> 00:22:20,867
So, pressures of the game,

00:22:20,867 --> 00:22:23,369
maybe it was Claudia's
way of coping.

00:22:23,369 --> 00:22:25,505
He also said that
she was having nightmares

00:22:25,505 --> 00:22:27,106
about a guy named Brent.

00:22:27,106 --> 00:22:29,175
Didn't think he was part
of the tennis world.

00:22:29,175 --> 00:22:31,010
Maybe he's part of this world.

00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:32,946
We got a print here.

00:22:36,282 --> 00:22:38,218
(computer blipping, trilling)

00:22:45,959 --> 00:22:47,961
RUSSELL:
"Darcy Shaw."

00:22:47,961 --> 00:22:50,063
"Felony drug distribution."

00:22:50,063 --> 00:22:51,531
SHAW:
<i>I'm not a drug dealer.</i>

00:22:51,531 --> 00:22:54,000
I'm a doctor.

00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,069
Well, Ms. Shaw, says here

00:22:56,069 --> 00:22:59,072
you, uh, took an online course
in hypnotherapy.

00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:02,175
That doesn't really
qualify you as a physician.

00:23:02,175 --> 00:23:05,178
Or give you the right to
dispense illegal drugs.

00:23:05,178 --> 00:23:08,114
Mind-altering drugs
like LSD have been used

00:23:08,114 --> 00:23:10,984
for thousands of years
to help open the mind

00:23:10,984 --> 00:23:12,819
and connect the body
with the soul.

00:23:12,819 --> 00:23:14,454
Along with hypnotherapy,
this can be

00:23:14,454 --> 00:23:18,458
a valuable tool in healing both
mental and physical ailments.

00:23:18,458 --> 00:23:22,395
And what ailment were you
treating Claudia Weber for?

00:23:22,395 --> 00:23:25,198
Claudia had been having
violent dreams,

00:23:25,198 --> 00:23:27,367
and I believe that they
were repressed memories

00:23:27,367 --> 00:23:30,837
of a traumatic experience
that happened when she was four.

00:23:30,837 --> 00:23:32,872
What kind
of a traumatic experience?

00:23:32,872 --> 00:23:36,075
I think that someone viciously
attacked Claudia and her mother.

00:23:36,075 --> 00:23:38,378
She actually remembered
this happening?

00:23:38,378 --> 00:23:41,948
Well, recovered memories--
it's not like a movie

00:23:41,948 --> 00:23:43,816
with a beginning,
middle and an end.

00:23:43,816 --> 00:23:45,752
It-It comes in flashes.

00:23:45,752 --> 00:23:48,054
And the brain doesn't
want to remember. It's...

00:23:48,054 --> 00:23:49,789
It's too painful.

00:23:49,789 --> 00:23:51,224
Mm. So how's that work?

00:23:51,224 --> 00:23:53,493
What, do you interpret
those flashes, do you?

00:23:53,493 --> 00:23:55,328
I wasn't influencing
Claudia's memories,

00:23:55,328 --> 00:23:57,330
if that's what
you're implying.

00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:59,198
I was just there
to guide her

00:23:59,198 --> 00:24:01,034
safely through
the process.

00:24:01,034 --> 00:24:03,970
I recorded the sessions
if you'd like to see them.

00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:05,838
SHAW:
<i>As I continue</i>

00:24:05,838 --> 00:24:10,043
to talk, you feel a heavy,
relaxed feeling come over you.

00:24:10,043 --> 00:24:12,945
With every word that I say,
it's putting you

00:24:12,945 --> 00:24:16,916
faster and deeper into
a peaceful state of hypnosis.

00:24:16,916 --> 00:24:18,318
How old are you, Claudia?

00:24:18,318 --> 00:24:20,053
Four.

00:24:20,053 --> 00:24:21,287
Look at that.

00:24:21,287 --> 00:24:23,189
She's already
under the influence.

00:24:23,189 --> 00:24:26,159
The LSD is making her
prone to suggestion.

00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,094
Maybe it's just
making it easier

00:24:28,094 --> 00:24:30,029
for her to tap
into her subconscious.

00:24:30,029 --> 00:24:32,098
SHAW:
Where are you?

00:24:32,098 --> 00:24:33,499
(Claudia panting)

00:24:33,499 --> 00:24:34,867
I'm in the woods.

00:24:34,867 --> 00:24:36,069
Who is with you?

00:24:36,069 --> 00:24:37,870
CLAUDIA:
<i>I'm in a tent.</i>

00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:40,039
<i>By myself.</i>

00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:43,309
I'm scared.
No one can hurt you.

00:24:43,309 --> 00:24:44,811
<i>You're safe.</i>

00:24:44,811 --> 00:24:46,846
(clanking, banging,
woman screaming)

00:24:46,846 --> 00:24:48,214
Mommy?!

00:24:48,214 --> 00:24:49,349
They're hurting her.

00:24:49,349 --> 00:24:50,483
SHAW:
Who's hurting her?

00:24:50,483 --> 00:24:52,085
I don't know.

00:24:52,085 --> 00:24:53,086
(man grunts)

00:24:56,923 --> 00:24:57,990
(Claudia gasps)

00:24:59,092 --> 00:25:00,193
(gasps)

00:25:01,828 --> 00:25:04,063
I need you to
stay in the tent.

00:25:04,063 --> 00:25:05,898
All right, everything's
going to be okay.

00:25:05,898 --> 00:25:07,166
I won't let anything
happen.

00:25:07,166 --> 00:25:08,234
Stay here.

00:25:08,234 --> 00:25:09,435
(zipping door)

00:25:09,435 --> 00:25:11,437
Brent!
SHAW:
Who's Brent?

00:25:13,239 --> 00:25:14,173
(grunting)

00:25:16,743 --> 00:25:17,910
Brent?

00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:19,779
Okay, so that was
her last session.

00:25:19,779 --> 00:25:21,247
What are you thinking?

00:25:21,247 --> 00:25:23,750
She talks about this guy
Brent, from her past,

00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:25,318
who tried to save her.

00:25:25,318 --> 00:25:26,853
If any of this
even happened.

00:25:26,853 --> 00:25:28,488
Why would you say that?

00:25:28,488 --> 00:25:30,857
Because it's a memory from
when she was four years old.

00:25:30,857 --> 00:25:33,359
Tr-trust me, kids' memories
are not the most reliable.

00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:35,461
They have vivid imaginations.

00:25:35,461 --> 00:25:38,498
Charlie--he swears
that he fell off a horse

00:25:38,498 --> 00:25:40,133
when he was
five years old.

00:25:40,133 --> 00:25:41,401
Never happened.

00:25:41,401 --> 00:25:44,504
But look at Claudia's
autopsy report.

00:25:44,504 --> 00:25:47,073
Doc found evidence
of an old brain injury

00:25:47,073 --> 00:25:50,376
right where she said she
got hit by the shovel.

00:25:50,376 --> 00:25:52,478
I mean, don't you think
it's strange

00:25:52,478 --> 00:25:54,514
that Claudia starts
having childhood memories

00:25:54,514 --> 00:25:56,282
of someone trying
to kill her,

00:25:56,282 --> 00:25:58,751
and then, one month later,
she's dead?

00:25:58,751 --> 00:26:01,020
I mean, that cannot
be a coincidence.

00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,955
Timing is interesting.

00:26:02,955 --> 00:26:05,057
I'm thinking that
whoever tried to kill her

00:26:05,057 --> 00:26:07,894
when she was a kid came
back to finish the job.

00:26:13,433 --> 00:26:15,134
Mr. Weber, I am so sorry
for your loss.

00:26:15,134 --> 00:26:16,936
Your daughter was
such a talented athlete.

00:26:16,936 --> 00:26:18,805
Thank you.

00:26:18,805 --> 00:26:21,007
You-you said you had some
questions you wanted to ask me.

00:26:21,007 --> 00:26:23,342
I do. Did you
and your family ever go

00:26:23,342 --> 00:26:25,878
on a camping trip
when Claudia was little?

00:26:25,878 --> 00:26:27,880
No.

00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:31,951
My wife wasn't really the, uh...
the roughing-it type.

00:26:31,951 --> 00:26:33,052
Why?

00:26:33,052 --> 00:26:34,787
Well, about month ago,

00:26:34,787 --> 00:26:36,989
Claudia started having memories
from when she was four.

00:26:36,989 --> 00:26:38,524
A-a camping trip where both

00:26:38,524 --> 00:26:41,394
she and her mother
were violently attacked.

00:26:41,394 --> 00:26:44,330
We always wondered
what happened.

00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:46,032
What do you mean?

00:26:46,032 --> 00:26:48,768
I'm not Claudia's
biological father.

00:26:48,768 --> 00:26:50,303
When she was
four years old,

00:26:50,303 --> 00:26:52,138
I found her
lying unconscious

00:26:52,138 --> 00:26:54,841
by the side of the road,
up in Mount Charleston.

00:26:54,841 --> 00:26:56,909
She was bleeding,
she was near death.

00:26:56,909 --> 00:26:58,744
I picked her up
and I took her to the hospital.

00:26:58,744 --> 00:27:00,346
Did you report it
to the police?

00:27:00,346 --> 00:27:02,348
Well, of course.
I told them.

00:27:02,348 --> 00:27:05,184
They searched the area
where I found her, but they...

00:27:05,184 --> 00:27:06,752
they never found her family.

00:27:06,752 --> 00:27:09,355
Did Claudia ever tell anyone
what happened to her?

00:27:09,355 --> 00:27:11,424
She didn't
remember anything.

00:27:11,424 --> 00:27:13,025
The only way we figured

00:27:13,025 --> 00:27:16,028
her name was Claudia
is because it was, uh...

00:27:16,028 --> 00:27:17,797
it was written
on her jacket.

00:27:17,797 --> 00:27:19,899
Did anyone ever
come looking for her?

00:27:19,899 --> 00:27:22,168
Were there any
missing persons reports?

00:27:22,168 --> 00:27:25,905
Nothing. I mean, we just
assumed she was abandoned.

00:27:25,905 --> 00:27:28,174
Social Services let
my wife and I become

00:27:28,174 --> 00:27:30,343
foster parents,
and then, um...

00:27:30,343 --> 00:27:34,013
well, eventually,
we adopted her.

00:27:34,013 --> 00:27:36,782
Did you tell Claudia
any of this?

00:27:36,782 --> 00:27:40,920
We just wanted her to
feel like she was ours.

00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,889
And she was.
She was ours.

00:27:42,889 --> 00:27:45,057
We thought it
was a blessing

00:27:45,057 --> 00:27:47,960
she didn't remember
what happened to her.

00:27:49,996 --> 00:27:52,098
FINLAY:
So, these were taken
at the hospital

00:27:52,098 --> 00:27:53,332
the day Claudia was found.

00:27:53,332 --> 00:27:55,134
She suffered
severe head trauma,

00:27:55,134 --> 00:27:57,403
dehydration
and multiple cuts and abrasions.

00:27:57,403 --> 00:27:59,338
You know, a head injury
would explain

00:27:59,338 --> 00:28:00,940
why she couldn't
remember anything.

00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,775
Yeah, not to mention
the emotional trauma

00:28:02,775 --> 00:28:04,310
from the attack.
You know, in all

00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:07,179
her sessions, Claudia never
mentioned a daddy, just Brent.

00:28:07,179 --> 00:28:08,514
Could be a brother,

00:28:08,514 --> 00:28:10,016
stepfather,
mother's boyfriend.

00:28:10,016 --> 00:28:13,819
Hey, look at that--
Blossom Ballerina.

00:28:13,819 --> 00:28:17,123
Just like the one you found
in Claudia's tennis bag.

00:28:17,123 --> 00:28:19,225
It looked like it hadn't
been cleaned in years.

00:28:19,225 --> 00:28:21,794
If she had that toy when
she was attacked,

00:28:21,794 --> 00:28:23,829
there still could be
evidence on it.

00:28:23,829 --> 00:28:24,931
I'll get it to Hodges.

00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,435
Hmm.

00:28:29,435 --> 00:28:32,238
You decapitated
Blossom Ballerina.

00:28:32,238 --> 00:28:34,373
Well, I assure you,
she didn't feel a thing.

00:28:34,373 --> 00:28:37,376
So, I talked
to Simon Weber.

00:28:37,376 --> 00:28:39,178
His wife passed away
a year ago.

00:28:39,178 --> 00:28:42,214
He was cleaning out his house,
going through boxes.

00:28:42,214 --> 00:28:45,184
He came across a box
of Claudia's old toys.

00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:47,019
Hmm.
Sent them to her
last month.

00:28:47,019 --> 00:28:49,221
Could be seeing this toy is
what triggered her memories.

00:28:49,221 --> 00:28:51,757
And if we can figure out who
tried to kill her back then,

00:28:51,757 --> 00:28:53,859
we might be able to
find out who killed her now.

00:28:53,859 --> 00:28:55,161
Exactly.

00:28:55,161 --> 00:28:57,029
Hm.

00:29:03,302 --> 00:29:05,738
Was there something else?

00:29:05,738 --> 00:29:07,740
Yeah.

00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:10,142
Elisabetta.

00:29:10,142 --> 00:29:13,279
That's... Wow.

00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,081
She's something, isn't she?

00:29:15,081 --> 00:29:17,149
Oh, yeah. Firecracker.

00:29:17,149 --> 00:29:18,818
She is Italian.

00:29:18,818 --> 00:29:22,254
I'm just surprised
you got engaged so quickly.

00:29:22,254 --> 00:29:25,424
Well, when you know,
you know, right?

00:29:25,424 --> 00:29:27,426
But...

00:29:27,426 --> 00:29:29,528
you guys haven't known
each other that long,

00:29:29,528 --> 00:29:33,065
and... marriage is not
something you rush into.

00:29:33,065 --> 00:29:36,202
I-I would just hate
to see you get hurt.

00:29:36,202 --> 00:29:39,038
Yeah. Uh, don't
worry about me.

00:29:43,976 --> 00:29:47,113
What if this woman is using
you to get a green card?

00:29:47,113 --> 00:29:49,115
Yeah.

00:29:49,115 --> 00:29:51,450
Why would a beautiful,
amazing woman

00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:53,085
want to marry me, right?

00:29:53,085 --> 00:29:55,154
That is not
what I meant at all.

00:29:55,154 --> 00:29:57,523
You know I think you are
a great guy; you know that.

00:29:57,523 --> 00:29:59,225
It took me

00:29:59,225 --> 00:30:02,094
ten months to choose
a new cell phone last year.

00:30:02,094 --> 00:30:04,930
I analyzed
consumer reports,

00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:07,033
data rates,
battery longevity.

00:30:07,033 --> 00:30:10,136
For once,
I'm following my heart,

00:30:10,136 --> 00:30:12,471
not analyzing everything.

00:30:12,471 --> 00:30:15,307
And that's great,
but you don't have to go

00:30:15,307 --> 00:30:17,309
from one extreme
to the other.

00:30:17,309 --> 00:30:19,245
Can't you just
be happy for me?

00:30:22,214 --> 00:30:24,216
I don't trust this woman.

00:30:24,216 --> 00:30:26,018
There's no other way
to say it.

00:30:26,018 --> 00:30:28,220
And deep down in your heart,
I don't think you do, either.

00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:30,089
If you thought
this was a real relationship,

00:30:30,089 --> 00:30:32,258
you'd be shouting it
from the rooftops, right?

00:30:32,258 --> 00:30:34,894
This is exactly why I didn't
say anything to anyone.

00:30:34,894 --> 00:30:37,163
Because I knew
this is how you'd all react.

00:30:37,163 --> 00:30:39,198
I just didn't
expect it from you.

00:30:41,267 --> 00:30:43,469
I love Elisabetta.

00:30:43,469 --> 00:30:46,038
Unless Immigration
gets in the way,

00:30:46,038 --> 00:30:47,506
I'm going to marry her.

00:30:53,145 --> 00:30:55,014
Hey, what do you got?

00:30:55,014 --> 00:30:56,882
Well, Hodges found traces
of Claudia's blood

00:30:56,882 --> 00:30:58,751
on that Blossom Ballerina.

00:30:58,751 --> 00:31:01,887
Lack of solubility suggested
it was a very old blood sample.

00:31:01,887 --> 00:31:03,756
So she did have it
during the attack.

00:31:03,756 --> 00:31:06,025
Well, you know, even though
Claudia was rescued,

00:31:06,025 --> 00:31:08,027
her mom never came
looking for her.

00:31:08,027 --> 00:31:10,162
Yeah, well, maybe
Mom and Brent

00:31:10,162 --> 00:31:12,798
never made it out
of those woods.
Exactly.

00:31:12,798 --> 00:31:15,067
Hodges found something else
mixed in with the blood.

00:31:15,067 --> 00:31:18,337
Sulfur. So, I've pulled up
a map of Mount Charleston.

00:31:18,337 --> 00:31:21,907
There are several
sulfur springs in the area.

00:31:21,907 --> 00:31:23,409
Well, according
to the police report,

00:31:23,409 --> 00:31:25,745
Simon Weber found Claudia
on a service road

00:31:25,745 --> 00:31:28,214
just South of Echo Cliff.

00:31:30,983 --> 00:31:32,384
There's a sulfur spring

00:31:32,384 --> 00:31:33,986
less than five
miles from there.

00:31:33,986 --> 00:31:36,088
Yeah, let's get some
ground-penetrating equipment

00:31:36,088 --> 00:31:37,289

Brent was their oldest child,

00:34:08,173 --> 00:34:10,743
and when he was 12,
they had Claudia.

00:34:10,743 --> 00:34:12,411
All-American family.
Well, not exactly.

00:34:12,411 --> 00:34:15,147
Martin Abbott
had a record.

00:34:15,147 --> 00:34:16,315
For what?

00:34:16,315 --> 00:34:19,118
Assault
and credit card fraud.

00:34:19,118 --> 00:34:20,853
When the family
disappeared,

00:34:20,853 --> 00:34:23,055
he had several
outstanding warrants.

00:34:23,055 --> 00:34:25,190
Maybe that's why nobody
reported the family missing.

For the past few weeks
she's been calling Brent Abbotts

00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:52,751
She was calling

I-I contacted
a few of them.

00:34:55,754 --> 00:34:58,490
Claudia asked them
all the exact same question:

00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:01,293
were they on a camping trip
18 years ago?

00:35:01,293 --> 00:35:03,896

these Brent Abbotts

really was her brother?

in those woods.

Got away with
murder once,

probably thought he
could do it again.

00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:21,313
Only problem is, Claudia called
at least 50 Brent Abbotts.

00:35:21,313 --> 00:35:23,382

several aliases.

Ernest Prestwich.

00:35:37,296 --> 00:35:39,164
Why does that sound
familiar?

Well, Ernest Prestwich is a
janitor at the tennis center,

but that's not
his real name.

According to his
contact information,

00:35:45,804 --> 00:35:49,008
he has an L.A. cell
registered to Brent Abbott.

00:35:49,008 --> 00:35:51,977
So Brent used one
of his dad's aliases

00:35:51,977 --> 00:35:54,013
but forgot to change
his cell phone number.

00:35:54,013 --> 00:35:57,016
I cross-referenced
Claudia's phone records.

00:35:57,016 --> 00:35:58,884
She called him a week ago.

00:35:58,884 --> 00:36:00,452
That's great.
Let's bring him in.

00:36:00,452 --> 00:36:02,755
Patrol just picked him up
at a service station.

00:36:02,755 --> 00:36:06,425
Looks like the past finally
caught up to you, Brent.

00:36:06,425 --> 00:36:08,460
We found your parents' bodies
on Mount Charleston,

00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,162
right where you buried 'em.

00:36:10,162 --> 00:36:12,798
After you beat them to
death with a shovel.

00:36:12,798 --> 00:36:14,366
We get it.

00:36:14,366 --> 00:36:16,168
Your old man
was bad news.

00:36:16,168 --> 00:36:17,903
I did some digging
into your history.

00:36:17,903 --> 00:36:20,272
I know you made a lot
of trips to the ER.

00:36:20,272 --> 00:36:23,275
I know that that son of a
bitch beat the crap out of you

00:36:23,275 --> 00:36:25,344
since you were
eight years old.

00:36:25,344 --> 00:36:27,012
We understand.

00:36:27,012 --> 00:36:29,181
Yeah, the cops even came
to your house a few times,

00:36:29,181 --> 00:36:31,450
and your mother never
pressed charges.

00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:33,886
She always
covered for him.

00:36:33,886 --> 00:36:35,921
She would always say

00:36:35,921 --> 00:36:39,158
that the bruises were
from fights at school

00:36:39,158 --> 00:36:41,994
and the broken bones
were from football.

00:36:41,994 --> 00:36:44,063
And on this family
camping trip

00:36:44,063 --> 00:36:47,499
you decided to end the
abuse once and for all.

00:36:47,499 --> 00:36:49,301
Am I right?

00:36:52,037 --> 00:36:55,741
We were in the middle
of the woods.

00:36:55,741 --> 00:36:59,078
So I waited for everyone to fall
asleep and I took out Dad first.

00:37:03,248 --> 00:37:06,885
Your dad abused you and your
mom did not protect you.

00:37:06,885 --> 00:37:09,755
But why would
you try to kill

00:37:09,755 --> 00:37:11,490
your four-year-old
little sister?

00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:14,827
I didn't mean
to hurt Claudia.

00:37:14,827 --> 00:37:17,262
I told her to wait in
the tent; she didn't listen.

00:37:18,397 --> 00:37:20,032
(grunting)

00:37:24,436 --> 00:37:27,372
Claudia!
Claudia!

00:37:27,372 --> 00:37:29,408
<i>I thought she was dead.</i>

00:37:29,408 --> 00:37:32,945
I went to dig the grave.

00:37:32,945 --> 00:37:34,746
When I turned around,
she was gone.

00:37:34,746 --> 00:37:37,049
But she saw what you did.

00:37:37,049 --> 00:37:40,152
Is that why you showed up
18 years later and killed her?

00:37:42,121 --> 00:37:45,424
I-I didn't kill her.

00:37:45,424 --> 00:37:48,961
I-I-I looked her up and saw
that she was playing in Vegas.

00:37:48,961 --> 00:37:50,863
I didn't come here
to kill her.

00:37:50,863 --> 00:37:54,399
I came here to, to talk to her,
explain my side of the story.

00:37:54,399 --> 00:37:57,035
Okay. What'd she say?

00:37:57,035 --> 00:37:59,972
I didn't get a chance
to talk to her.

00:37:59,972 --> 00:38:02,808
I went to the courts that night,
and she wasn't there...

00:38:02,808 --> 00:38:04,743
so I left.

00:38:09,081 --> 00:38:11,250
I didn't kill my sister.

00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:13,485
G-give me a-a-a polygraph
or take my DNA--

00:38:13,485 --> 00:38:15,954
whatever it is you people do--
but I didn't kill Claudia.

00:38:19,024 --> 00:38:21,193
What time did you
leave the court?

00:38:21,193 --> 00:38:22,995
It, it was, like, 1:00.

00:38:22,995 --> 00:38:24,229
Can anyone verify that?

00:38:26,031 --> 00:38:28,333
It was pretty deserted.

00:38:28,333 --> 00:38:30,502
N-No, there was the other,
uh, tennis player, though,

00:38:30,502 --> 00:38:33,205
um, Janssen,
Tara Janssen.

00:38:33,205 --> 00:38:35,007
She was there.

00:38:36,508 --> 00:38:37,910
What was she doing?

00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:39,244
I don't know,
practicing, I guess.

00:38:39,244 --> 00:38:41,113
She had a basket
full of tennis balls.

00:39:15,447 --> 00:39:18,850
We found your prints
in Claudia Weber's blood.

00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:21,420
BRASS:
Game. Set. Murder.

00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:23,422
RUSSELL:
You know,
I always thought

00:39:23,422 --> 00:39:25,791
that you just killed Claudia

00:39:25,791 --> 00:39:27,926
'cause you were
a sore loser, but...

00:39:27,926 --> 00:39:30,429
murder over an off day
seemed a bit extreme,

00:39:30,429 --> 00:39:33,332
so... we took
a closer look.

00:39:33,332 --> 00:39:35,167
You know, I always
wondered what players said

00:39:35,167 --> 00:39:36,768
to each other
after a match,

00:39:36,768 --> 00:39:39,338
so we isolated
and boosted the audio.

00:39:39,338 --> 00:39:40,906
Good match.

00:39:40,906 --> 00:39:43,108
By the way, I'm sleeping
with your husband.

00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:47,279
Ooh, that's cold.

00:39:47,279 --> 00:39:49,448
I probably would have just
stuck with a handshake.

00:39:50,949 --> 00:39:52,351
Out of curiosity,

00:39:52,351 --> 00:39:55,754
how long have you been
involved with Ivan?

00:39:56,855 --> 00:39:59,825
Almost a year.

00:39:59,825 --> 00:40:01,226
He and Claudia were
having problems

00:40:01,226 --> 00:40:03,128
long before I came
into the picture.

00:40:03,128 --> 00:40:04,529
So, instead of
helping your friend,

00:40:04,529 --> 00:40:06,498
you helped yourself
to her husband.

00:40:06,498 --> 00:40:08,333
I loved him.

00:40:08,333 --> 00:40:10,302
He was going to ask
Claudia for a divorce.

00:40:10,302 --> 00:40:12,938
That's why he went
over there that night.

00:40:12,938 --> 00:40:14,906
I'm sorry, I know,
she doesn't...

00:40:14,906 --> 00:40:18,443
JANSSEN:
<i>But instead he told her</i>
<i>that he still loved her</i>

00:40:18,443 --> 00:40:21,280
<i>and that he wanted</i>
<i>to work on their marriage.</i>

00:40:22,781 --> 00:40:25,050
Claudia agreed

00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:26,518
to give him
a second chance.

00:40:26,518 --> 00:40:29,021
She didn't even love him.

00:40:29,021 --> 00:40:31,156
She just didn't want
me to have him.

00:40:31,156 --> 00:40:33,091
That's enough
to set anybody off,

00:40:33,091 --> 00:40:35,260
especially someone
with a temper like yours.

00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:38,163
She took everything
from me that night.

00:40:38,163 --> 00:40:41,400
She took the match
and she took Ivan.

00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,302
I hated her for that.

00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:50,242
(both grunting)

00:40:57,149 --> 00:40:59,051
(yells)

00:40:59,051 --> 00:41:00,986
(sobs)

00:41:00,986 --> 00:41:05,257
I killed her and I stuffed
her body in the ball machine.

00:41:05,257 --> 00:41:07,225
Me and Ivan--

00:41:07,225 --> 00:41:09,094
we were good together.

00:41:10,429 --> 00:41:12,197
We were.

00:41:12,197 --> 00:41:14,166
She just should
have walked away.

00:41:14,166 --> 00:41:17,936
Yeah, but she didn't, so you
eliminated your competition

00:41:17,936 --> 00:41:19,805
on and off the court.

00:41:19,805 --> 00:41:21,840
So, instead of
serving aces,

00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,743
all you'll be
serving is time.

00:41:30,382 --> 00:41:32,818
Hey, glad I
caught you.

00:41:32,818 --> 00:41:36,388
Oh, hi, I was just going
to get dinner with my dad.

00:41:36,388 --> 00:41:39,124
Oh, tell him I said hi.

00:41:39,124 --> 00:41:41,259
I just wanted to thank you.

00:41:41,259 --> 00:41:42,928
My lawyer called
and told me

00:41:42,928 --> 00:41:44,963
that you talked
to Immigration;

00:41:44,963 --> 00:41:46,898
gave me a glowing
character reference.

00:41:48,333 --> 00:41:50,302
Seemed like it couldn't
hurt, right?

00:41:50,302 --> 00:41:52,003
Mm-hmm.

00:41:52,003 --> 00:41:55,273
Yeah, but you weren't
exactly supportive

00:41:55,273 --> 00:41:57,743
of my relationship
with Elisabetta.

00:41:59,478 --> 00:42:01,279
(sighs)

00:42:01,279 --> 00:42:03,482
You're my friend, and I just
want what's best for you,

00:42:03,482 --> 00:42:07,819
so, if she makes you happy,
then it's good enough for me.

00:42:12,057 --> 00:42:13,992
Thank you.

00:42:15,494 --> 00:42:18,029
I should go.

00:42:18,029 --> 00:42:20,365
Okay.

00:42:20,365 --> 00:42:21,767
(sighs)

00:42:21,767 --> 00:42:23,168
FINLAY:
<i>So, I guess Tara Janssen</i>

00:42:23,168 --> 00:42:25,103
will go down in the
history books after all.

00:42:25,103 --> 00:42:27,172
Yeah, just not the way
she wanted, I'm guessing.

00:42:27,172 --> 00:42:28,440
Mm.

00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,275
So now you can take
her spot on the tour.

00:42:30,275 --> 00:42:31,343
(laughs)
That's funny.

00:42:31,343 --> 00:42:33,044
Now, don't be so modest.

00:42:33,044 --> 00:42:35,814
I heard that Chris Evert said
you had some real talent.

00:42:35,814 --> 00:42:39,017
Well, I did play a lot
when I was a kid.
You ever think
about turning pro?

00:42:39,017 --> 00:42:42,120
Oh, when I was 15,
yeah, for a second.

00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,121
What happened?

00:42:43,121 --> 00:42:44,756
Life--life happened.

00:42:44,756 --> 00:42:46,491
Well, I'm glad it did.

00:42:46,491 --> 00:42:48,260
Yeah, me, too.
