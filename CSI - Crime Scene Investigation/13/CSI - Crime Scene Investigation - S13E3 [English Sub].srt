Happy anniversary.

No, I'm taking

No, music festivals,

We have an unknown
male assailant.

00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:41,874
He shot four or five rounds
into the crowd.

00:02:41,874 --> 00:02:43,676
Panic gave way
to trampling,

00:02:43,676 --> 00:02:45,044

No I.D.,

00:02:48,114 --> 00:02:49,482
no bracelet, either.

00:02:49,482 --> 00:02:50,683
Maybe she didn't
pay to get in.

00:02:50,683 --> 00:02:52,051
This whole area
is fenced in.

00:02:52,051 --> 00:02:53,619
I'm thinking she,
uh, crawled under.

PHILLIPS:
Looks like a standard

00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:15,742
Somebody grabbed hold
of her pretty tight.

00:03:15,742 --> 00:03:17,443
Bruises and nail gouges.

00:03:17,443 --> 00:03:20,179
Whoever grabbed her is missing
a couple of fingernails.

00:03:20,179 --> 00:03:21,581

00:03:23,082 --> 00:03:24,717
Only problem
is they're all tripping.

Reports range from sketchy
to hallucinogenic.

00:03:26,619 --> 00:03:28,688
Although a couple people did say

00:03:28,688 --> 00:03:30,590

Uh-huh.

00:03:32,191 --> 00:03:33,726

Well, hopefully,
she's still running.

You know, this doesn't seem like
a random shooting to me.

00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:41,134
Think she
was targeted?

00:03:41,134 --> 00:03:42,568
And the other one
got away.

00:03:42,568 --> 00:03:44,036
Yeah, but for how long?

00:03:44,036 --> 00:03:46,906
Okay, looks like that girl
is our witness, then.

00:03:46,906 --> 00:03:48,574
Maybe our next victim.

00:03:48,574 --> 00:03:52,178

before the shooter does.

You found a mushroom

00:04:43,529 --> 00:04:45,631
Uh, wrong kind
of mushroom.

00:04:45,631 --> 00:04:49,735
Psilocybin, the, uh, fun ones,
they grow in meadows and fields,

00:04:49,735 --> 00:04:51,671
and have dark spores

00:04:51,671 --> 00:04:53,573
and little gills.

00:04:53,573 --> 00:04:56,542

So maybe this is where
our girls came from.

00:05:06,052 --> 00:05:08,621
There's a whole lot of desert
here in Nevada.

00:05:08,621 --> 00:05:09,856
Maybe this little devil

00:05:09,856 --> 00:05:11,991

00:05:36,616 --> 00:05:38,050
What is that?

00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,485
Nitrous oxide.

00:05:39,485 --> 00:05:40,720
Hmm.

00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,189
This tank took
an incredible journey

00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:45,691
all the way from
this cart carrier

00:05:45,691 --> 00:05:47,627
back over there.

00:05:50,129 --> 00:05:53,432
I'm thinking one of
the shooter's bullets

00:05:53,432 --> 00:05:55,835
punctured the tank,
causing the N2O to blow.

00:05:55,835 --> 00:05:57,803
(hollow clanging)

00:05:57,803 --> 00:06:00,473
And the pressure was so high
that the metal deformed outward

00:06:00,473 --> 00:06:03,442
while the gas escaped.

00:06:03,442 --> 00:06:06,646
Witnesses say the tank
was breathing fire,

00:06:06,646 --> 00:06:08,614
but nitrous oxide
isn't flammable.

00:06:08,614 --> 00:06:11,751
Yeah, but it is a
potent oxidizer,

00:06:11,751 --> 00:06:15,421
providing more oxygen
than the atmosphere.

00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:20,026
All it needs is a spark.

00:06:20,026 --> 00:06:21,994
Raver lights up.

00:06:21,994 --> 00:06:24,897

00:06:24,897 --> 00:06:26,899

00:06:28,968 --> 00:06:33,105
I was just lighting up,
my cigarette,

00:06:33,105 --> 00:06:35,174
and I heard
these two bangs.

00:06:35,174 --> 00:06:37,076
You know, loud.
Bang! Pop! Pop!

00:06:37,076 --> 00:06:41,614
And this fire comes raining
down, you know, like a dragon.

00:06:41,614 --> 00:06:44,583
And my hand was, like,

00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:46,719
more baked than me.

00:06:46,719 --> 00:06:49,755
Dragon aside, uh, did you see
the girl get shot?

00:06:49,755 --> 00:06:51,457
Oh, yeah.

00:06:51,457 --> 00:06:53,626
Poor little flower, yeah.

00:06:53,626 --> 00:06:54,961
Was there anyone
with the "flower?"

00:06:54,961 --> 00:06:56,162
Oh, yeah.

00:06:56,162 --> 00:06:59,532
John Lennon.
Uh, or Kurt Cobain.

00:06:59,532 --> 00:07:01,033
I could only
see their aura.

00:07:01,033 --> 00:07:04,603
Um, oh, you know, I got some
of it on my smartphone.

00:07:04,603 --> 00:07:05,805
About five megapixels.

00:07:05,805 --> 00:07:08,674
Would that be better?

00:07:08,674 --> 00:07:10,476
(phone beeping)

00:07:10,476 --> 00:07:12,478
(helicopter flying overhead)

00:07:14,447 --> 00:07:18,084
Hi. CSI Brody.
What happened to your arm?

00:07:18,084 --> 00:07:21,587
I was dancing, got in the
way of a flying tank.

00:07:25,558 --> 00:07:27,827
Since when do they let patients
treat themselves?

00:07:27,827 --> 00:07:29,195
Oh, well, I'm a
medical intern.

00:07:29,195 --> 00:07:32,098
I figured the paramedics
were busy enough.

00:07:32,098 --> 00:07:34,133
You do seem kind of lucid
for this crowd.

00:07:34,133 --> 00:07:37,603
Yeah, well, I don't drink,
I don't do drugs.

00:07:37,603 --> 00:07:39,205
I just came
to dance off some stress.

00:07:39,205 --> 00:07:41,674
If you were dancing
by the tank,

00:07:41,674 --> 00:07:43,576
then you must have seen
the girl get shot.

00:07:43,576 --> 00:07:45,544
No.
What about the shooter?

00:07:45,544 --> 00:07:46,879
Sorry.

00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,447
When I heard the shots,
I hit the dirt.

00:07:48,447 --> 00:07:49,882
Tried to get small.

00:07:49,882 --> 00:07:52,651
Well, I'm still going to need
your information.

00:07:54,086 --> 00:07:56,422
Hey, uh, the girl
who got shot,

00:07:56,422 --> 00:07:57,890
is she going to be okay?

00:08:01,894 --> 00:08:03,095
Jane Doe,

00:08:03,095 --> 00:08:06,065
number 12-608,

00:08:06,065 --> 00:08:07,767
a malnourished female

00:08:07,767 --> 00:08:10,803
between the ages of 16 and 20.

00:08:10,803 --> 00:08:14,540
C.O.D. is a single
gunshot wound to the torso,

00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,042
perforating the heart.
(door opens)

00:08:16,042 --> 00:08:18,444
Victim presents evidence
of persistent,

00:08:18,444 --> 00:08:19,845
chronic trauma.

00:08:19,845 --> 00:08:22,214
And abrasions on the wrists

00:08:22,214 --> 00:08:27,420
consistent with ligature
restraints, possibly shackles.

00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,422
General muscular atrophy

00:08:29,422 --> 00:08:31,157
and posterior bed sores

00:08:31,157 --> 00:08:34,460
suggest victim was subjected
to imprisonment

00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:37,196
for an extended period
and confined to a bed

00:08:37,196 --> 00:08:39,498
or other flat surface.

00:08:39,498 --> 00:08:40,699
Sexual assault?

00:08:40,699 --> 00:08:42,835
There's only one reason

00:08:42,835 --> 00:08:45,471
to keep a girl shackled
and on her back.

00:08:45,471 --> 00:08:47,073
She was a sex slave.

00:08:47,073 --> 00:08:48,574
I can count on my hand

00:08:48,574 --> 00:08:52,745
the times I've taken comfort

00:08:52,745 --> 00:08:54,580
in seeing someone on my table.

00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,749
You know, I'm not sure I buy

00:08:56,749 --> 00:08:59,018
that whole "they're
in a better place" angle.

00:08:59,018 --> 00:09:00,553
Given her condition,

00:09:00,553 --> 00:09:03,122
I am having trouble
imagining a worse place.

00:09:03,122 --> 00:09:05,991
Sara, this girl has
never been to a dentist

00:09:05,991 --> 00:09:07,460
or a doctor.

00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,061
She suffered years of neglect.

00:09:09,061 --> 00:09:11,597
We've both seen
victims like this.

00:09:11,597 --> 00:09:13,732
Even if they survive,

00:09:13,732 --> 00:09:15,901
they're never going
to be made whole.

00:09:15,901 --> 00:09:18,471
She should have had
a chance to try.

00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:22,975
Well, witnesses saw her

00:09:22,975 --> 00:09:24,844
running away
from the shooter.

00:09:24,844 --> 00:09:26,212
Have you considered
the possibility

00:09:26,212 --> 00:09:29,014
she was running from her captor?

00:09:29,014 --> 00:09:31,684
Human trafficking's a
multi-billion dollar business,

00:09:31,684 --> 00:09:33,018
and if that's what this is,

00:09:33,018 --> 00:09:34,720
there may be more
girls out there.

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,655
We know there's at least one.

00:09:36,655 --> 00:09:38,157
If we can find her,
maybe this

00:09:38,157 --> 00:09:40,025
little girl's death

How many smartphones
did we collect?

00:09:45,097 --> 00:09:46,499
SANDERS:
Fifty-seven,

00:09:46,499 --> 00:09:49,135
plus a dozen clips
from YouTube.

00:09:49,135 --> 00:09:51,103
I hate electronic music.

00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,805
Not today, you don't.

00:09:52,805 --> 00:09:54,773
It's the only way I could
sync up all these clips

00:09:54,773 --> 00:09:57,743
so we can watch our
crime scene play out

00:09:57,743 --> 00:09:58,978
as a music video.

00:10:01,213 --> 00:10:03,415
(electronic music blaring)

00:10:03,415 --> 00:10:06,051
Now, most of the phones were
turned towards the stage,

00:10:06,051 --> 00:10:08,154
so no sign of our killer.

00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:15,194
Hold on.

00:10:15,194 --> 00:10:17,663
Zoom in on the tank.

00:10:18,964 --> 00:10:21,066
Can you get a better angle
on that pink fur?

00:10:21,066 --> 00:10:23,636
I have so many angles...

00:10:25,971 --> 00:10:27,840
...we might as well be there.

lose your license.

to lose my career

I took an oath to do.

00:11:40,846 --> 00:11:44,583
She was... freaked-out,
she was scared,

00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:46,619
so I hid her in my car

00:11:46,619 --> 00:11:48,087
where I could take care
of her injuries.

00:11:48,087 --> 00:11:49,788
There were police
officers everywhere.

00:11:49,788 --> 00:11:50,990
You could've
told someone.

00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:52,558
I couldn't, all right?

00:11:52,558 --> 00:11:54,460
I've been around
freaked-out people before.

00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,995
She was...
she was like an animal.

00:11:55,995 --> 00:11:57,696
She wouldn't talk.

00:11:57,696 --> 00:12:01,000
She just kept staring at me
with these wild eyes.

00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,102
So why did she trust you?

00:12:03,102 --> 00:12:04,603
I don't know.

00:12:04,603 --> 00:12:06,005
Her friend was dead, and...

00:12:06,005 --> 00:12:07,706
I tried to help her.

00:12:07,706 --> 00:12:10,175
I guess she clung on to me
because she had nobody else.

00:12:10,175 --> 00:12:12,745
Where is she now?

00:12:14,713 --> 00:12:16,148
No, no. She's
photophobic.

00:12:16,148 --> 00:12:18,150
She can't handle
the light.

00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,785
(laughs softly)

00:12:19,785 --> 00:12:21,720
So, what was the plan?

00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,423
You were just going to leave her
in the basement forever?
(sighs)

00:12:24,423 --> 00:12:26,725
I was hoping she'd calm down
and I could admit her.

00:12:31,163 --> 00:12:33,732
See for yourself.

00:12:39,038 --> 00:12:40,806

00:12:40,806 --> 00:12:43,108

The anterior margin's

00:15:22,134 --> 00:15:24,102
jagged and irregular.

Not a surgical removal.

00:15:28,207 --> 00:15:30,809
a household tool, pliers maybe.

Scarring and healing suggests
the removal occurred

00:16:22,661 --> 00:16:25,664
That's consistent with
witness testimony at the rave.

00:16:25,664 --> 00:16:28,534
Listen, she knows
who did this to her,

00:16:28,534 --> 00:16:30,669

person who shot her friend.

The mushroom

Humor is my way of
dealing with the horror.

00:17:19,084 --> 00:17:21,587
It's a crass and essential
defense mechanism-- otherwise,

00:19:37,656 --> 00:19:39,424
Highway 238.

00:19:39,424 --> 00:19:40,992
Smugglers' Alley.
I can't tell you

00:19:40,992 --> 00:19:43,128
how many busts
I made on this road.

00:19:43,128 --> 00:19:45,530
Ooh. You smell that?

00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:46,732
Mmm, cow pies.

00:19:46,732 --> 00:19:48,100
Getting homesick on me?

00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,835
(laughing):
Yeah, I'm getting there.

00:19:49,835 --> 00:19:52,104
We got footprints.

00:19:52,104 --> 00:19:54,639
They seem to start right here
in this hay and sawdust.

00:19:58,977 --> 00:20:00,645
Yeah, here we go.

00:20:00,645 --> 00:20:02,614
What do you got?

00:20:03,648 --> 00:20:05,417
That's an R-FID tag.

00:20:05,417 --> 00:20:09,688
Radio Frequency Identification
used on cattle.

00:20:09,688 --> 00:20:14,559
And that... looks like the last
of the shoe impressions.

00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,862
So...

00:20:16,862 --> 00:20:20,098
the girls started
running from here.

00:20:20,098 --> 00:20:23,001
Where does this road
come from again?

00:20:23,001 --> 00:20:25,003
Bullhead City.

00:20:25,003 --> 00:20:27,105
Look at these
tire impressions.

00:20:27,105 --> 00:20:29,074
Looks like a semi.

00:20:29,074 --> 00:20:30,475
Yeah.

00:20:30,475 --> 00:20:32,477
Could be looking
at a cattle hauler.

00:20:32,477 --> 00:20:34,212
And I'm thinking
a lot more than that.

00:20:34,212 --> 00:20:36,047
This road's notorious
for drug trafficking,

00:20:36,047 --> 00:20:37,983
human trafficking,
all sorts of trafficking.

00:20:37,983 --> 00:20:40,051
You know, what
I don't get is,

00:20:40,051 --> 00:20:41,853
if our girls are
really on that truck,

00:20:41,853 --> 00:20:43,755
why stop and let
them off here, right?

00:20:43,755 --> 00:20:45,824
STOKES:
There's another set

00:20:45,824 --> 00:20:47,559
of tire impressions here.

00:20:47,559 --> 00:20:48,794
That's a passenger vehicle.

00:20:48,794 --> 00:20:50,629
Yeah, narrower
wheelbase.

00:20:50,629 --> 00:20:52,731
Looks like an accident.

00:20:52,731 --> 00:20:54,866
STOKES:
Involving...

00:20:54,866 --> 00:20:56,168
a red vehicle.

00:20:56,168 --> 00:20:59,037
And the other one was blue.

00:20:59,037 --> 00:21:00,906
Pieces of a headlamp
here, too.

00:21:00,906 --> 00:21:02,707
Okay, so we got skid marks,

00:21:02,707 --> 00:21:05,510
and the car forced
the cattle hauler off the road.

00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:07,879
But... what do you think,
road rage?

00:21:07,879 --> 00:21:09,781
(vehicle rumbling)
Yeah.

00:21:11,483 --> 00:21:13,585
(tires squeal, vehicles bump)

00:21:19,024 --> 00:21:21,993
STOKES:
I mean, if the truck
did come to a stop,

00:21:21,993 --> 00:21:24,496
the girls could have had
a chance to get away.

00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:26,898
Well, if we can I.D.

00:21:26,898 --> 00:21:29,167
the truck and the driver,

00:21:29,167 --> 00:21:31,970
we can find our shooter.

00:21:36,641 --> 00:21:38,944
(phone ringing in distance)

00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:40,679
(gasps)

00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:42,080
Hey, hey, it's okay.

00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,481
You're safe.

00:21:43,481 --> 00:21:45,183
You're in the hospital.

00:21:45,183 --> 00:21:47,519
It's okay.

00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,489
(siren wailing in distance)

00:21:51,489 --> 00:21:55,060
I know it-it seems
like a scary place, but...

00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,529
it's actually not that bad.

00:21:57,529 --> 00:22:00,198
My dad was here
recently,

00:22:00,198 --> 00:22:03,735
and... and he ended up okay.

00:22:05,437 --> 00:22:07,439
You're going to be okay, too.

00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:13,945
I don't know
if you can understand me.

00:22:13,945 --> 00:22:15,680
I don't know
what happened to you

00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,782
or where you've been, but...

00:22:17,782 --> 00:22:20,151
I want to help you.

00:22:22,087 --> 00:22:24,723
I know why you can't talk.

00:22:24,723 --> 00:22:26,958
(sighs)

00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:29,794
But I-I thought maybe...

00:22:29,794 --> 00:22:32,797
you could write down the answers
to some of my questions.

00:22:32,797 --> 00:22:34,799
Can you try
writing your name?

00:22:37,569 --> 00:22:39,571
What-what about your address?

00:22:39,571 --> 00:22:42,007
Where-where you live?
Your house?

00:22:43,441 --> 00:22:45,744
Your mother's name or...

00:22:45,744 --> 00:22:47,779
your father's name?

00:22:49,814 --> 00:22:53,084
What about the girl
you were with? Your friend?

00:22:53,084 --> 00:22:56,554
Can you write her name?

00:23:00,558 --> 00:23:03,128
(sighs)
Um...

00:23:03,128 --> 00:23:05,130
Well...

00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:08,166
this is... my name.

00:23:10,568 --> 00:23:14,606
Morgan Brody. That's me.

00:23:14,606 --> 00:23:17,142
This is my address.

00:23:17,142 --> 00:23:21,980
In Green Valley, and this
is my best friend's name.

00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:24,549
David Hodges. (laughs)

00:23:24,549 --> 00:23:27,085
At first, I didn't
like him very much.

00:23:27,085 --> 00:23:29,854
He was...

00:23:29,854 --> 00:23:31,589
kind of weird.

00:23:31,589 --> 00:23:34,559
But, you know, he's actually
a really sweet guy.

00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:38,129
He's smart and... funny.

00:23:40,432 --> 00:23:42,934
Our parents are dating,
which is so weird.

00:23:44,769 --> 00:23:47,505
Sorry. Way, way
too much about me.

00:24:14,733 --> 00:24:18,036
Thank you for trusting me.

00:24:24,642 --> 00:24:26,945
What is this?

00:24:29,881 --> 00:24:32,884
(sighs)

00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:38,156
The man who killed your friend--
did he do this to you?

00:24:39,924 --> 00:24:43,194
(quiet crying)

00:24:43,194 --> 00:24:45,196
(sighs)

00:24:45,196 --> 00:24:46,798
(sniffles)

00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:49,567
Hey. Hey.

00:24:49,567 --> 00:24:52,804
I'm going to find him,

00:24:52,804 --> 00:24:55,807
and I'm going to make him pay
for what he did to you.

00:24:55,807 --> 00:24:57,809
I promise.

00:24:59,544 --> 00:25:01,446
This is all she gave me.

00:25:01,446 --> 00:25:04,649
RUSSELL:
No name, no address.
Just a drawing.

00:25:04,649 --> 00:25:06,851
What do you think?

00:25:06,851 --> 00:25:10,722
Jail cell?
Or barred window? Flowers?

00:25:10,722 --> 00:25:12,490
Our girl was
a prisoner.

00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:14,059
Maybe this
was her view

00:25:14,059 --> 00:25:16,094
of the world. Maybe this is
where she was being held.

00:25:16,094 --> 00:25:18,530
Doesn't help us
with a location, though.
STOKES: No, no.

00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:19,898
But we may be getting closer.

00:25:19,898 --> 00:25:22,434
I tracked the girls
to Highway 238.

00:25:22,434 --> 00:25:24,069
There was clear evidence
of an accident

00:25:24,069 --> 00:25:25,837
involving a cattle hauler.

00:25:25,837 --> 00:25:27,872
Cattle hauler.
Yeah, yeah.

00:25:27,872 --> 00:25:31,076
We found an R-FID tag
at the scene.

00:25:31,076 --> 00:25:33,945
RUSSELL:
Two girls, chained, caged.

00:25:33,945 --> 00:25:35,580
You know, treated like cattle.

00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:36,948
It's not a stretch to think

00:25:36,948 --> 00:25:38,950
the driver
of the hauler is our guy.

00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:40,585
Or just a delivery man

00:25:40,585 --> 00:25:42,687
who was part
of something much bigger.

00:25:42,687 --> 00:25:44,823
Yeah, but how do we track
that down?

00:25:44,823 --> 00:25:47,425
Okay, well, the truck
was coming from Bullhead City.

00:25:47,425 --> 00:25:49,861
We found red and blue debris
from a big rig in the highway.

00:25:49,861 --> 00:25:51,830
It was definitely
in a fender bender.

00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:53,998
So, Moreno checked
with D.O.T.

00:25:53,998 --> 00:25:56,734
Got a list of all red
and blue cattle haulers

00:25:56,734 --> 00:25:59,437
moving through Bullhead City
in the last 24 hours.

00:25:59,437 --> 00:26:01,506
Got an I.D.
on our murder weapon.

00:26:01,506 --> 00:26:03,074
.41 Ruger Magnum.

00:26:03,074 --> 00:26:05,176
Greg printed up a list
of registered owners.

00:26:05,176 --> 00:26:08,613
What are the odds?
Two lists.

00:26:08,613 --> 00:26:10,615
Oh, here we go.

00:26:10,615 --> 00:26:14,519
"Oliver Ruiz, El Paso, Texas."

00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:15,987
Pulling him up.

00:26:15,987 --> 00:26:19,824
(keyboard keys clicking,
computer beeps, trilling)

00:26:19,824 --> 00:26:21,693
SIDLE:
Got a name and a face.

00:26:21,693 --> 00:26:23,128
Now we just got
to find him.

00:26:23,128 --> 00:26:25,196
Oh, I bet he's still
in the neighborhood.

00:26:25,196 --> 00:26:26,698
He only half-finished

00:26:26,698 --> 00:26:28,099
the job.

00:26:32,604 --> 00:26:34,939
(computers trilling,
distant phone ringing)

00:26:34,939 --> 00:26:36,541
Hey, there you are.

00:26:36,541 --> 00:26:39,010
Uh, I ran the swab you
gave me from the girl,

00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:40,211
the one without
the tongue.

00:26:40,211 --> 00:26:41,779
Sorry. You know
who I mean.

00:26:41,779 --> 00:26:43,481
You got a hit
in Missing Persons?

00:26:43,481 --> 00:26:45,917
No, not on her, and not
on the dead girl, either,

00:26:45,917 --> 00:26:47,886
but I did get
something.
What?

00:26:47,886 --> 00:26:50,488
A definite familial match.

00:26:50,488 --> 00:26:51,890
The girls were related?

00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:53,491
It's a classic 25:50:25.

00:26:53,491 --> 00:26:54,759
I did a linkage ratio.

00:26:54,759 --> 00:26:56,528
SIDLE:
<i>Sisters?</i>

00:26:56,528 --> 00:26:58,897
That narrows down
our cases quite a bit.

00:26:58,897 --> 00:27:01,499
BRODY:
She couldn't even write.
Not her name.

00:27:01,499 --> 00:27:03,201
Not anything.
She could only draw.

00:27:03,201 --> 00:27:05,069
Tells us they were abducted
as small children.

00:27:05,069 --> 00:27:06,905
Never even been
to school.
BRODY:
Our girl

00:27:06,905 --> 00:27:08,773
is between the age of 15 and 16,
which means

00:27:08,773 --> 00:27:10,675
we're looking for two sisters
who were abducted

00:27:10,675 --> 00:27:11,943
at least ten years ago.

00:27:11,943 --> 00:27:13,178
(computer trilling)

00:27:13,178 --> 00:27:14,579
SIDLE:
Here's something.

00:27:14,579 --> 00:27:16,915
2001, Prescott, Arizona,

00:27:16,915 --> 00:27:18,483
two sisters went missing.

00:27:18,483 --> 00:27:21,920
Jacinta Flores and Rosa Flores.

00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,756
(computer chirps)

00:27:24,756 --> 00:27:27,025
SANDERS:
It's hard to tell.

00:27:27,025 --> 00:27:28,826
I can tell.

00:27:28,826 --> 00:27:31,429
That's our girl.

00:27:31,429 --> 00:27:33,631
SIDLE:
Father told the police
that the mother took off

00:27:33,631 --> 00:27:35,066
in the middle of the night
with the kids

00:27:35,066 --> 00:27:36,501
and took everything.

00:27:36,501 --> 00:27:38,436
Is there any theory
as to where they went?

00:27:38,436 --> 00:27:40,939
SIDLE:
Mother does have family
in Mexico.

00:27:40,939 --> 00:27:43,007
So, mom goes south
of the border.

00:27:43,007 --> 00:27:46,844
Something happens to her, or-or
she just unloads the girls.

00:27:46,844 --> 00:27:48,947
And they end up
in the sex trade.

00:27:48,947 --> 00:27:50,648
Is there contact info
for the father?

00:27:50,648 --> 00:27:52,417
SIDLE:
No.

00:27:52,417 --> 00:27:54,886
But the investigating officer
in Prescott is listed.

00:27:54,886 --> 00:27:56,721
Wait a minute.

00:27:56,721 --> 00:27:59,657
It looks like the father has
kept in touch all these years.

00:27:59,657 --> 00:28:01,593
He contacts Prescott PD

00:28:01,593 --> 00:28:03,528
every couple of weeks
to follow up.

00:28:03,528 --> 00:28:05,530
I'll call the IO.
Thanks.

00:28:07,999 --> 00:28:09,834
All right, keep me posted.

00:28:09,834 --> 00:28:12,537
And hey, post that
truck driver's photo up

00:28:12,537 --> 00:28:13,972
all over that hospital, okay?

00:28:13,972 --> 00:28:15,440
He could show up.

00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,941
Yeah, yeah, we're on it.

00:28:16,941 --> 00:28:19,944
Hodges is working
on the R-FID tag as we speak.

00:28:19,944 --> 00:28:21,679
Stay tuned. What's up?

00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,781
Uh, well, my union says

00:28:23,781 --> 00:28:27,051
that I get two 15-minute
breaks and a half-hour lunch.

00:28:27,051 --> 00:28:31,689
You give me something,
I'll give you something back.

00:28:31,689 --> 00:28:35,493
Okay. How about a story?

00:28:35,493 --> 00:28:38,129
Mmm, should I lay down?
Mnm, no, you're good.

00:28:38,129 --> 00:28:41,099
I'm-I'm eating...

00:28:41,099 --> 00:28:43,101
It's called
"Journey of the Mexican Cow."

00:28:43,101 --> 00:28:45,436
Chapter One: "Ow!

00:28:45,436 --> 00:28:49,007
My ear has just been pierced
with an R-FID tag."

00:28:49,007 --> 00:28:51,042
Chapter Two: "All aboard!"

00:28:51,042 --> 00:28:52,610
(Hodges imitates
a vehicle revving)

00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:54,112
"Everything
you've ever wanted to know

00:28:54,112 --> 00:28:57,415
"about my so-called bovine life
is encoded in my ear,

00:28:57,415 --> 00:28:59,951
which is then uploaded to a
database as I cross the border."

00:28:59,951 --> 00:29:01,419
I know what
R-FID tags do.

00:29:01,419 --> 00:29:03,888
"Beep. <i>Hola.</i>

00:29:03,888 --> 00:29:05,423
Howdy. I've just crossed."

00:29:05,423 --> 00:29:07,058
Pshh.

00:29:07,058 --> 00:29:09,627
"Now I've reached
my final destination."

00:29:09,627 --> 00:29:12,730
Please tell me this story
has a final destination.

00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:15,199
Yes, because our cattle
hauler's shipment,

00:29:15,199 --> 00:29:17,201
including our
burger-on-the-hoof friend here,

00:29:17,201 --> 00:29:20,138
reached the end of the line
at a feedlot in Pahrump.

00:29:20,138 --> 00:29:22,073
When?
This morning.

00:29:22,073 --> 00:29:23,641
Oh. Give it to me.

00:29:28,513 --> 00:29:31,416
Moreno. Stokes.

00:29:31,416 --> 00:29:32,950
We narrowed down
the search area.

00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:34,152
We?

00:29:34,152 --> 00:29:35,720
The truck's last known location

00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,488
was a feedlot in Pahrump.

00:29:37,488 --> 00:29:39,023
RUSSELL:
<i>Listen to me--</i>
<i>I know you wanted</i>

00:29:39,023 --> 00:29:40,425
<i>to catch the guy, but...</i>

00:29:40,425 --> 00:29:42,460
you did good work today.

00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:44,929
You're bringing
this girl home to her father.

00:29:44,929 --> 00:29:47,665
What do we even tell him?

00:29:47,665 --> 00:29:49,667
Um... (sighs)
well, you know,

00:29:49,667 --> 00:29:51,636
he's been looking
for his children for years.

00:29:51,636 --> 00:29:53,971
Yeah, and now one of them's
dead, and the other's...

00:29:53,971 --> 00:29:56,541
Wait. Hold on.
Mr. Flores? Hi.

00:29:56,541 --> 00:29:58,142
I'm CSI Russell.

00:29:58,142 --> 00:30:00,545
This is CSI Brody.
Hi.

00:30:01,612 --> 00:30:02,814
I would have been here sooner,

00:30:02,814 --> 00:30:03,981
but I was on a job.

00:30:03,981 --> 00:30:05,183
HVAC replacement in Havasu.

00:30:05,183 --> 00:30:06,584
They told me about Rosa.

00:30:06,584 --> 00:30:08,186
I'm so sorry for your loss.

00:30:08,186 --> 00:30:09,687
Where's Jacinta?

00:30:09,687 --> 00:30:11,489
She's sedated.

00:30:11,489 --> 00:30:12,790
The doctors say
she should recover

00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:14,092
from most of
her injuries.

00:30:14,092 --> 00:30:15,860
What do you mean,
"most of her injuries"?

00:30:19,831 --> 00:30:21,099
Sir, she's...

00:30:21,099 --> 00:30:22,667
BRODY:
You should know Rosa

00:30:22,667 --> 00:30:25,169
did everything she could
to protect her sister.

00:30:25,169 --> 00:30:28,539
Jacinta has been
through hell,

00:30:28,539 --> 00:30:30,541
but it could have been
a lot worse.

00:30:30,541 --> 00:30:32,043
She's a fighter.

00:30:32,043 --> 00:30:34,679
Mr. Flores,
you need

00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:36,180
to prepare yourself.

00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:37,548
It's been 11 years.

00:30:37,548 --> 00:30:39,784
Why? What happened to her?

00:30:46,991 --> 00:30:48,993
Oh, my God.

00:30:49,994 --> 00:30:52,463
(crying quietly)

00:30:52,463 --> 00:30:54,799
Ah, that's so much time.

00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:57,802
She's not a child anymore.

00:30:57,802 --> 00:31:00,838
She... she's a young woman.

00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,775
(crying)

00:31:03,775 --> 00:31:05,176
(sighs)
Can I see her?

00:31:05,176 --> 00:31:06,878
RUSSELL:
Actually, you know what?

00:31:06,878 --> 00:31:09,147
Why-why don't we, uh...
why don't we let her sleep

00:31:09,147 --> 00:31:10,581
for a little while, okay?

00:31:10,581 --> 00:31:12,583
Let us buy you
a cup of coffee.

00:31:12,583 --> 00:31:13,785
Yeah.

00:31:13,785 --> 00:31:15,787
Come on.

00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:21,092
(speaking Spanish)

00:31:21,092 --> 00:31:22,693
(speaking Spanish)

00:31:22,693 --> 00:31:24,495
(garbled radio transmission)

00:31:24,495 --> 00:31:25,730
Where'd you find him?

00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:26,931
I found him sleeping

00:31:26,931 --> 00:31:28,833
in his cattle hauler
at a truck stop.

00:31:28,833 --> 00:31:31,169
Take this piece of
trash to the box.

00:31:31,169 --> 00:31:32,670
(man grunts)

00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:34,872
I found these in the
cab-- .41 Mag ammo.

00:31:34,872 --> 00:31:36,474
Same caliber as
the murder weapon.

00:31:36,474 --> 00:31:37,675
Where's the gun?

00:31:37,675 --> 00:31:38,876
Scumbag probably tossed it.

00:31:38,876 --> 00:31:41,012
Who is she?

00:31:41,012 --> 00:31:45,016
I found her hidden
in Ruiz's truck.

00:31:45,016 --> 00:31:47,685
(siren wails,
garbled radio transmission)

00:31:54,692 --> 00:31:56,694
(gasps)

00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:00,131
You're safe now.

00:32:00,131 --> 00:32:02,433
That guy's not going
to hurt you anymore.

00:32:02,433 --> 00:32:04,602
We're collecting evidence
that could put him away

00:32:04,602 --> 00:32:06,504
for a very long time.

00:32:06,504 --> 00:32:08,506
STOKES:
But we need your help.

00:32:08,506 --> 00:32:10,208
We know what he did...

00:32:10,208 --> 00:32:13,511
to those girls.

00:32:13,511 --> 00:32:16,013
And you do, too.

00:32:16,013 --> 00:32:19,617
What he did to them, he
was going to do to you.

00:32:19,617 --> 00:32:24,021
And he's going to do to
other girls unless you...

00:32:24,021 --> 00:32:26,657
You're wrong!

00:32:26,657 --> 00:32:28,493
He's a good man.

00:32:28,493 --> 00:32:30,661
He would never
hurt anyone, ever!

00:32:30,661 --> 00:32:31,896
How can you say that?

00:32:31,896 --> 00:32:34,432
He's my cousin.

00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,034
Your cousin?

00:32:37,034 --> 00:32:39,170
He tried to give me
a better life.

00:32:40,638 --> 00:32:42,773
I-I lived in Juarez,

00:32:42,773 --> 00:32:45,943
and got caught up
with bad people.

00:32:45,943 --> 00:32:48,212
Ollie offered
to take me north.

00:32:48,212 --> 00:32:50,515
I never saw those girls before.

00:32:50,515 --> 00:32:52,817
I didn't even know
they were in the truck.

00:32:55,186 --> 00:32:57,188
<i>Not until the accident.</i>

00:32:57,188 --> 00:32:59,190
<i>I felt a jolt.</i>

00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:01,192
<i>Then I heard voices arguing.</i>

00:33:01,192 --> 00:33:04,095
(indistinct shouting)

00:33:04,095 --> 00:33:06,664
<i>That's when I saw the girls.</i>

00:33:06,664 --> 00:33:08,966
<i>They were running.</i>

00:33:08,966 --> 00:33:10,935
<i>They were scared.</i>

00:33:10,935 --> 00:33:12,904
It wasn't Ollie's fault.

00:33:12,904 --> 00:33:15,172
The other man ran us
off the road.

00:33:15,172 --> 00:33:17,008
STOKES:
Was the other man

00:33:17,008 --> 00:33:18,476
chasing the girls?

00:33:26,817 --> 00:33:28,653
Your cousin told me
about the guy

00:33:28,653 --> 00:33:29,854
who ran you off the road

00:33:29,854 --> 00:33:31,055
last night.

00:33:31,055 --> 00:33:32,657
Forget about

00:33:32,657 --> 00:33:34,559
all the immigration laws
you've broken.

00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,961
The ammo we found in your truck

00:33:36,961 --> 00:33:39,430
put a hole through that girl
and killed her.

00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:41,933
Now, if you don't start
talking, you're the one

00:33:41,933 --> 00:33:45,469
that's going down for it.
It's as simple as that, man.

00:33:45,469 --> 00:33:48,472
Oh, yeah, Ollie...

00:33:48,472 --> 00:33:50,074
if I were you,
I'd listen to the man.

00:33:51,676 --> 00:33:52,944
<i>Habla.</i>

00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:58,950
I was just driving.

00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:01,519
This car came out of nowhere...

00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:03,120
<i>forced me off the road.</i>

00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,556
<i>This guy in a hoodie</i>
<i>comes out acting crazy.</i>

00:34:05,556 --> 00:34:07,458
<i>Starts telling me,</i>
<i>"Where are the girls?"</i>

00:34:07,458 --> 00:34:09,460
<i>I told him I didn't know</i>
<i>what he was talking about.</i>

00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,995
<i>Then he grabs me.</i>
<i>I got scared.</i>

00:34:10,995 --> 00:34:12,697
<i>I reached for the gun</i>
<i>underneath my seat.</i>

00:34:12,697 --> 00:34:14,765
<i>Before I can do anything</i>
<i>with it,</i>

00:34:14,765 --> 00:34:17,101
<i>he ripped it out of my hand.</i>

00:34:17,101 --> 00:34:19,470
He told me he'd kill me
if I talked to anyone.

00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:22,173
Where did he grab you?

00:34:22,173 --> 00:34:23,874
Interstate 238.
Just outside...

00:34:23,874 --> 00:34:25,209
No, no, no.

00:34:25,209 --> 00:34:27,612
I'm talking about
where on your body

00:34:27,612 --> 00:34:29,013
did he grab you?

00:34:35,086 --> 00:34:38,689
Henry didn't find any
secondary DNA on Ruiz's shirt.

00:34:38,689 --> 00:34:41,993
I, however, did find
trace amounts of a chemical.

00:34:41,993 --> 00:34:44,662
R-502.

00:34:44,662 --> 00:34:46,864
Very unusual, rare...

00:34:46,864 --> 00:34:48,199
Mind if I just...
Thank you.

00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:50,001
A rare refrigerant used in

00:34:50,001 --> 00:34:52,903
air conditioning.
Primarily older
HVAC systems.

00:34:52,903 --> 00:34:54,739
Oh, my God.

00:34:54,739 --> 00:34:56,007
Is there a problem?
Yeah.

00:34:56,007 --> 00:34:57,642
The girl's father...

00:34:57,642 --> 00:35:00,678
his business is HVAC systems.

00:35:00,678 --> 00:35:03,047
(gunshot)

00:35:04,749 --> 00:35:06,584
Hey, D.B. What's up?

00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:11,489
What?

00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:21,065
Where is she?

00:35:21,065 --> 00:35:22,466
Oh, well, you just missed her.

00:35:22,466 --> 00:35:23,701
She was discharged.

00:35:23,701 --> 00:35:25,703
Her dad said he
was taking her home.

00:35:32,143 --> 00:35:34,545
Why the hell would you pull
your uni off the door? The girl

00:35:34,545 --> 00:35:36,180
is the victim of a predator,
and you basically

00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,548
just sent her
right back to him.

00:35:37,548 --> 00:35:39,083
Are you done?
You are going to be.

00:35:39,083 --> 00:35:41,052
What are you going to do?
Run to daddy to complain?

00:35:41,052 --> 00:35:42,853
Is that all you have?
No, I got a lot more...

00:35:42,853 --> 00:35:44,522
Hey, Morgan.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:35:44,522 --> 00:35:46,791
Take it easy.

00:35:46,791 --> 00:35:48,092
Detective.

00:35:48,092 --> 00:35:49,593
Sir.
You want to walk me

00:35:49,593 --> 00:35:50,961
through this?
Tell me what happened?

00:35:50,961 --> 00:35:52,763
I can tell you
what happened...
Hey, stop.

00:35:52,763 --> 00:35:53,964
Stop.
(sighs)

00:35:53,964 --> 00:35:55,533
What your CSI
is not hearing

00:35:55,533 --> 00:35:57,968
is that the father
is the legal guardian.

00:35:57,968 --> 00:35:59,570
And the doctor is the one

00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:01,772
who released the girl,
not me.

00:36:01,772 --> 00:36:02,973
And this was at a time

00:36:02,973 --> 00:36:04,575
when our number one suspect

00:36:04,575 --> 00:36:06,644
was a cattle hauler,
not the dad.

00:36:06,644 --> 00:36:08,045
You called the father

00:36:08,045 --> 00:36:09,447
and actually had him

00:36:09,447 --> 00:36:10,781
brought here.

00:36:10,781 --> 00:36:13,050
And I accept
responsibility for that.

00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:14,985
Unlike you
and the rest of the...

00:36:14,985 --> 00:36:16,420
Hey, hey, you know what?

00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,822
You guys
can work this out later.

00:36:17,822 --> 00:36:19,790
Right now, we're dealing
with a textbook sadist.

00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:20,991
If you think

00:36:20,991 --> 00:36:22,193
he was taking it easy

00:36:22,193 --> 00:36:23,894
on Jacinta before,

00:36:23,894 --> 00:36:25,796
can you imagine what he's
doing to her right now.

00:36:25,796 --> 00:36:28,566
So can we please focus
on how to find them?

00:36:28,566 --> 00:36:29,967
Yes, sir.
Thank you.

00:36:29,967 --> 00:36:31,802
Guy's driving a blue Taurus.
Arizona plates.

00:36:31,802 --> 00:36:33,537
Got a broadcast out,
AMBER alert,

00:36:33,537 --> 00:36:36,040
and have the PD staked out
outside of his house.

00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,776
Look, he's too smart to go home.
I agree.

00:36:38,776 --> 00:36:40,978
This is where he took her.
This is what we have to find.

00:36:43,914 --> 00:36:45,716
OLLIE:
Yeah, yeah, that's him.

00:36:45,716 --> 00:36:47,418
That's the guy
who took my gun.

00:36:47,418 --> 00:36:49,120
And he's the one
who chased after those girls.

00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,621
He's their old man.

00:36:50,621 --> 00:36:51,922
He's been abusing them
for years.

00:36:51,922 --> 00:36:53,824
He used your gun
to kill one of them.

00:36:53,824 --> 00:36:56,026
And now he's
got the other one.

00:36:56,026 --> 00:36:57,428
And she's going to be dead, too,

00:36:57,428 --> 00:36:58,696
if you don't help me out here.

00:36:58,696 --> 00:37:00,197
How can I help?

00:37:00,197 --> 00:37:02,767
I pulled your truck log.

00:37:02,767 --> 00:37:04,735
This is the route you took
from Juarez to Pahrump.

00:37:04,735 --> 00:37:06,504
Stopped at a weigh station
in Fort Mohave.

00:37:06,504 --> 00:37:07,705
The next one was Pahrump.

00:37:07,705 --> 00:37:10,541
Now, between Mohave
and Pahrump,

00:37:10,541 --> 00:37:13,744
your truck gained 220 pounds.

00:37:13,744 --> 00:37:15,579
I thought the scales were off.

00:37:15,579 --> 00:37:17,982
It must have been the girls
sneaking on.

00:37:17,982 --> 00:37:21,118
And did you stop anywhere
between Mohave and Pahrump?

00:37:21,118 --> 00:37:22,553
Yeah, yeah,

00:37:22,553 --> 00:37:23,954
I stopped to eat
in Bullhead City.

00:37:25,523 --> 00:37:27,825
The rave was here,
off Highway 238.

00:37:27,825 --> 00:37:29,827
Tungsten mine is
three miles away.

00:37:29,827 --> 00:37:31,796
And Bullhead City is here.

00:37:31,796 --> 00:37:34,431
Which is where the girls
got on the truck.
We know they were

00:37:34,431 --> 00:37:36,467
traveling on foot.
And they couldn't
have gotten

00:37:36,467 --> 00:37:37,802
more than a couple miles.

00:37:37,802 --> 00:37:39,470
So wherever the father
was holding them

00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:40,704
had to be in the area, right?

00:37:40,704 --> 00:37:42,106
So we're looking around here.

00:37:44,508 --> 00:37:45,943
Which is still a needle
in a sandbox.

00:37:45,943 --> 00:37:48,612
Except we do know
what we're looking for.

00:37:48,612 --> 00:37:50,147
Jacinta drew it for me.

00:37:50,147 --> 00:37:52,950
Flowers.

00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:55,486
I just see a whole lot
of desert.

00:37:55,486 --> 00:37:57,154
Maybe we're looking
for a house.

00:37:57,154 --> 00:37:58,622
You know,
with a garden.

00:37:59,623 --> 00:38:01,492
Or a farm.

00:38:01,492 --> 00:38:03,761
One that's
harvesting wind.

00:38:05,496 --> 00:38:08,165
Maybe Jacinta
wasn't drawing flowers.

00:38:23,881 --> 00:38:25,115
You know this
is all your fault?

00:38:26,784 --> 00:38:28,652
You got your
sister killed.

00:38:30,521 --> 00:38:32,823
She was a good girl.

00:38:32,823 --> 00:38:35,960
She didn't mouth off to me,
like you.

00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,895
But we took care of that,
didn't we?

00:38:41,799 --> 00:38:43,801
(helicopter blades whirring)

00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:55,546
Nah, false alarm.

00:38:55,546 --> 00:38:58,082
You think someone's
going to come for you?

00:38:59,583 --> 00:39:01,952
It didn't have
to be like this.

00:39:03,821 --> 00:39:05,022
But you ran away.

00:39:05,022 --> 00:39:06,957
Right? Hmm?

00:39:06,957 --> 00:39:08,158
You're the one

00:39:08,158 --> 00:39:10,694
who broke up
this family!

00:39:10,694 --> 00:39:12,730
And for what, huh?

00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:14,098
Look where you are now.

00:39:14,098 --> 00:39:17,001
You're back home with me.

00:39:17,001 --> 00:39:20,437
I am the only one
who ever loved you.

00:39:30,447 --> 00:39:32,449
(tires screeching)

00:39:37,187 --> 00:39:38,589
(gun cocks)

00:39:38,589 --> 00:39:40,791
MORENO:
Don't move, or I will

00:39:40,791 --> 00:39:41,992
turn you to pink mist!

00:39:41,992 --> 00:39:43,961
On your knees!

00:39:43,961 --> 00:39:45,195
I smell gasoline.

00:39:47,932 --> 00:39:50,534
STOKES:
Drop the lighter.

00:39:50,534 --> 00:39:51,835
(lighter clicks)

00:39:51,835 --> 00:39:53,470
Drop the lighter!

00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:00,177
Jacinta!

00:40:00,177 --> 00:40:01,578
STOKES:
Morgan, stop!

00:40:01,578 --> 00:40:03,047
BRODY:
Jacinta!

00:40:03,047 --> 00:40:05,716
Where's the key?

00:40:05,716 --> 00:40:07,618
STOKES:
Morgan!

00:40:07,618 --> 00:40:09,420
Search him.
He's got a key.

00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:11,956
STOKES:
See if he's got
a key on him.

00:40:16,126 --> 00:40:18,796
Don't worry.
It's going to be okay.

00:40:18,796 --> 00:40:20,197
All right?
All right, we're going

00:40:20,197 --> 00:40:22,433
to get you out of here.
You're going to be fine.

00:40:23,934 --> 00:40:25,169
Let's help you up.

00:40:25,169 --> 00:40:28,038
Let's go.
We got you.

00:40:28,038 --> 00:40:30,741
Relax, huh?

00:40:30,741 --> 00:40:32,176
(indistinct radio transmission)

00:40:32,176 --> 00:40:34,044
All right?
Yeah.

00:40:34,044 --> 00:40:35,646
MORENO:
Watch your head, okay?

00:40:35,646 --> 00:40:37,614
Wouldn't want
to hurt you.

00:40:39,049 --> 00:40:41,585
(sighs)

00:40:41,585 --> 00:40:43,787
You know, for a CSI...

00:40:43,787 --> 00:40:45,856
you make a pretty good cop.

00:40:45,856 --> 00:40:49,026
Today, I think that honor
goes to our friend over there.

00:40:51,862 --> 00:40:54,198
No doubt.

00:40:55,766 --> 00:40:57,935
Your father
told the police that...

00:40:57,935 --> 00:40:59,903
your mother ran off
with you and your sister

00:40:59,903 --> 00:41:01,171
to Mexico.

00:41:04,808 --> 00:41:06,610
He lied.

00:41:12,149 --> 00:41:13,751
Is your mother dead?

00:41:16,553 --> 00:41:18,722
She found out what he
was doing to Rosa?

00:41:21,725 --> 00:41:24,061
And you were next?

00:41:27,064 --> 00:41:28,632
Rosa wasn't
going to let that happen.

00:41:28,632 --> 00:41:30,534
She was going to get you
as far away

00:41:30,534 --> 00:41:32,102
from him as she could.

00:41:44,048 --> 00:41:46,683
Your sister saved your life.

00:41:53,857 --> 00:41:56,660
(sighs)

00:41:58,128 --> 00:42:00,564
It's over.

00:42:02,199 --> 00:42:04,435
You're safe now.
