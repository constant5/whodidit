00:00:06,482 --> 00:00:10,085
(playing "Chopsticks")

00:00:25,935 --> 00:00:27,202
I didn't know you played, Jim.

00:00:27,202 --> 00:00:29,872
I dabble.

00:00:29,872 --> 00:00:31,473
That doesn't sound good.

00:00:31,473 --> 00:00:32,708
No, it's not.

00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:34,877
I got a call, a couple
hikers wandered into

00:00:34,877 --> 00:00:37,680
what may be the piano
show from hell.

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,181
A little out of the way
for a concert.

00:00:39,181 --> 00:00:41,650
RUSSELL:
Shall we?

00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:45,421
Oh, boy.

00:00:45,421 --> 00:00:47,056
Not your usual body dump.

00:00:47,056 --> 00:00:48,791
BRASS: I'm guessing mid-30s,
no wallet, no purse.

00:00:48,791 --> 00:00:50,593
Early stages of rigor.

00:00:50,593 --> 00:00:53,829
Got to be dead at least
eight to ten hours.

00:00:53,829 --> 00:00:55,564
Blood pool inside the piano.

00:00:55,564 --> 00:00:57,600
No accompanying
blood on the ground.

00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,801
She wasn't killed here.

00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:02,838
You're awful quiet over there.

00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:06,175
I know her.

00:01:08,811 --> 00:01:11,413
Alison Bailey.

00:01:11,413 --> 00:01:12,982
A music journalist
from New York.

00:01:12,982 --> 00:01:15,618
She helped me with my Vegas
book a couple years ago.

00:01:15,618 --> 00:01:17,019
Vegas book?

00:01:17,019 --> 00:01:20,022
Yeah, about the history
of the Mob in Las Vegas.

00:01:20,022 --> 00:01:22,691
So, did you know her well?

00:01:24,627 --> 00:01:26,862
Uh, a couple meetings.

00:01:26,862 --> 00:01:29,598
She wrote a couple
books herself.

00:01:29,598 --> 00:01:31,567
About the music scene
in Vegas in the '60s.

00:01:31,567 --> 00:01:33,602
So, a piano expert
ends up dead in a piano.

00:01:33,602 --> 00:01:34,870
RUSSELL:
Got to be connected.

00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,739
Whoever killed her

00:01:36,739 --> 00:01:38,941
wasn't a stranger in the night.

PHILLIPS :
I hate pianos.

00:02:16,745 --> 00:02:17,946
BRODY:
Really?

00:02:17,946 --> 00:02:19,481
Six years
of piano lessons--

00:02:19,481 --> 00:02:22,518
my mother's idea.

00:02:22,518 --> 00:02:24,086
Best day of my life?

00:02:24,086 --> 00:02:28,490
My piano teacher backs her car
into my mom's new Cadillac.

00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:29,958
Never saw Mrs. Liebowitz again.

00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:32,628
Lucky you.
Mm-hmm.

00:02:32,628 --> 00:02:33,796
(sighs)

00:02:33,796 --> 00:02:36,465
Not so much
for Greg, though.

00:02:36,465 --> 00:02:38,033
Russell says he knew the victim.

00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:39,768
PHILLIPS: Well, I hope
he didn't know her well.

00:02:39,768 --> 00:02:40,803
She was cut to ribbons.

00:02:45,607 --> 00:02:47,176
BRODY:
Triangular dolly.

00:02:47,176 --> 00:02:49,478
Rules out out any,
uh, drunk pranks.

00:02:49,478 --> 00:02:51,447
"Hey, let's steal
the bar piano."

00:02:53,115 --> 00:02:56,185
Whoever did this could have
been a professional mover.

00:02:56,185 --> 00:02:58,053
(sighs)

00:02:58,053 --> 00:03:00,456
At least this one's intact.

00:03:00,456 --> 00:03:03,192
Most pianos suffer a worse fate.

00:03:03,192 --> 00:03:05,461
I didn't realize
pianos had fates.

00:03:05,461 --> 00:03:06,895
Generally, a junkyard.

00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:09,798
Thousands of moving parts.

00:03:09,798 --> 00:03:11,467
Repairs are expensive.

00:03:11,467 --> 00:03:13,535
Cheaper to buy a new one.

00:03:13,535 --> 00:03:15,471
Yeah, or some
digital keyboard.

00:03:16,672 --> 00:03:18,674
It's a shame.

00:03:18,674 --> 00:03:20,676
Old pianos are
a thing of beauty.

00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:26,715
Look at the end of
the dolly tracks here.

00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:30,853
Rectangular impression.

00:03:30,853 --> 00:03:32,988
Maybe from a truck tailgate?

00:03:34,823 --> 00:03:36,658
BRODY: <i>Piano's dropped here,</i>
<i>little push.</i>

00:03:36,658 --> 00:03:37,993
SANDERS:
<i>Could have been a one-man job.</i>

00:03:41,764 --> 00:03:43,532
Something is wedged
between the keys.

00:03:48,771 --> 00:03:52,574
Edges are jagged,
and it's opaque.

00:03:52,574 --> 00:03:54,009
Maybe some kind of latex?

00:03:58,547 --> 00:03:59,982
Did you see this?
Black trace?

00:03:59,982 --> 00:04:02,050
Yeah, it's all over the keys.

00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:05,420
It's also all over the inside
of the piano case.

00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,522
Let's collect it,

00:04:06,522 --> 00:04:08,190
get this piano
back to the lab.

00:04:19,501 --> 00:04:21,003
Whole right side's lit up.

00:04:21,003 --> 00:04:22,671
So, the victim

00:04:22,671 --> 00:04:25,207
was definitely slashed
in proximity to the piano.

00:04:25,207 --> 00:04:26,742
With extreme force.

00:04:26,742 --> 00:04:28,977
Blood says killer
had to have

00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:30,112
sliced her carotid.

00:04:36,852 --> 00:04:39,588
Metal plate:
"Haggenmiller and Sons."

00:04:39,588 --> 00:04:41,757
Looks like somebody's
obliterated the serial number.

00:04:41,757 --> 00:04:44,726
Do you know since 1896,
all Haggenmiller pianos

00:04:44,726 --> 00:04:45,928
were manufactured

00:04:45,928 --> 00:04:47,729
at the same
factory in St. Paul?

00:04:47,729 --> 00:04:50,465
With the serial number,
you can track a piano

00:04:50,465 --> 00:04:52,601
to the exact date it left
the factory floor.

00:04:52,601 --> 00:04:55,437
I take it this is not
your first body in a piano.

00:04:55,437 --> 00:04:56,972
First ones with
the limbs intact.

00:04:56,972 --> 00:05:00,042
Well, I always knew
Seattle was a music town.

00:05:00,042 --> 00:05:01,543
I'll see what I can
do about bringing

00:05:01,543 --> 00:05:02,978
that serial number back to life.

00:05:02,978 --> 00:05:04,746
If we can find out where
the piano came from,

00:05:04,746 --> 00:05:06,481
maybe we'll find the killer.

00:05:06,481 --> 00:05:09,952
(whirring)

00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:19,094
(sizzling)

00:05:40,849 --> 00:05:42,885
Hey.

00:05:42,885 --> 00:05:44,953
I, uh...

00:05:44,953 --> 00:05:46,488
found
a hotel key card.

00:05:46,488 --> 00:05:48,490
She was, uh, staying
at the Palermo.

00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:52,628
What was she like?

00:05:52,628 --> 00:05:54,663
A small-town
girl from Iowa.

00:05:54,663 --> 00:05:56,431
Smart.

00:05:56,431 --> 00:05:57,699
Funny.

00:05:57,699 --> 00:05:59,935
Huge Sinatra fan.

00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,036
(sighs)

00:06:01,036 --> 00:06:02,604
Come on, Greg.

00:06:02,604 --> 00:06:05,140
You guys were doing more
than write a book, right?

00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:08,877
It was a...

00:06:08,877 --> 00:06:10,178
a week of fun.

00:06:10,178 --> 00:06:11,647
Why didn't you guys
stay in touch?

00:06:11,647 --> 00:06:15,083
It was just a fling.

00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,752
For you or for her?

00:06:16,752 --> 00:06:19,521
If it meant that much to her,

00:06:19,521 --> 00:06:21,023
I think she would
have looked me up.

00:06:22,557 --> 00:06:23,492
Can we...

00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,497
...keep this from Russell?

00:06:28,497 --> 00:06:30,966
Sure.

00:06:30,966 --> 00:06:32,701
I'll process her room.

00:06:32,701 --> 00:06:34,202
Little advice, though:

00:06:34,202 --> 00:06:37,572
I would stay out of
autopsy.

00:06:37,572 --> 00:06:41,944
C.O.D. is exsanguination due
to multiple incised wounds.

00:06:41,944 --> 00:06:43,679
27 to be exact.

00:06:43,679 --> 00:06:44,680
Overkill.

00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,982
But no sexual assault.

00:06:46,982 --> 00:06:50,752
Defensive wounds on
the fingers and wrist.

00:06:50,752 --> 00:06:51,954
She put up a fight.

00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:53,188
Any idea what the weapon was?

00:06:54,823 --> 00:06:56,124
Hilt bruises
on the wounds.

00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:59,594
Depth and width
suggest a box cutter.

00:06:59,594 --> 00:07:02,164
Something that a piano mover
might carry around with him?

00:07:02,164 --> 00:07:05,133
I found these inorganics in a
couple of the larger wounds.

00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:09,871
This looks like the trace

00:07:09,871 --> 00:07:12,674
that Greg pulled out
of the piano keys.

00:07:12,674 --> 00:07:14,643
<i>Hodges is already</i>
<i>working on it.</i>

00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:28,790
So?

00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:29,791
Hover much?

00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,126
Results?

00:07:31,126 --> 00:07:32,694
Shouldn't we wait
for Russell first?

00:07:32,694 --> 00:07:34,196
I'll stop the
questions if you do.

00:07:34,196 --> 00:07:36,732
Trace found in the piano
and in the girl's wounds.

00:07:36,732 --> 00:07:39,534
Carbon black and
polyvinylchloride.

00:07:39,534 --> 00:07:42,838
These other fragments
that you found in the piano:

00:07:42,838 --> 00:07:46,775
Hide glue, straight from the
horse's... fibrous tissues.

00:07:46,775 --> 00:07:48,977
You see how these edges line up?

00:07:48,977 --> 00:07:50,879
I'm thinking that our shards

00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,082
<i>des Monsieur Ed</i> are from
one sheet of dried glue.

00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,023
There are striations
on one side.

00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:03,125
Looks like a wood grain imprint.

00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:04,693
So you're thinking
a piano repairman

00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:06,128
got into it with our victim?

00:08:06,128 --> 00:08:08,997
Well, who else would be
using glue on a piano?

00:08:08,997 --> 00:08:10,432
That's a brilliant theory, Greg.

00:08:10,432 --> 00:08:11,933
There's just one problem.

00:08:11,933 --> 00:08:14,736
See, I tested all the glue
that held our piano together

00:08:14,736 --> 00:08:18,006
and it's not a match to any
of the fragments that you found.

00:08:18,006 --> 00:08:20,208
Oh, and the carbon black
and polyvinylchloride--

00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,677
it's sheet vinyl,
commonly used

00:08:22,677 --> 00:08:24,880
in floor tile covering.

00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,449
My theory is that you're looking
for somebody in construction.

00:08:30,185 --> 00:08:31,787
My pleasure.

00:08:37,926 --> 00:08:39,494
What's all this?

00:08:39,494 --> 00:08:41,696
It's evidence
from Alison's hotel room

00:08:41,696 --> 00:08:42,731
at the Palermo?

00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:44,599
She checked in five days ago.

00:08:44,599 --> 00:08:46,101
It's definitely
not our primary though.

00:08:46,101 --> 00:08:47,102
Place was clean.

00:08:47,102 --> 00:08:49,538
Well, was she moving in?

00:08:49,538 --> 00:08:50,839
She set up a work station.

00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:52,441
Lots of books and files.

00:08:52,441 --> 00:08:54,776
Think she was
researching a new book.

00:08:54,776 --> 00:08:56,912
I also found this.

00:08:56,912 --> 00:08:59,581
An appointment book.

00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:01,416
Last entry was yesterday.

00:09:04,786 --> 00:09:07,823
Some kind of
number/letter sequence

00:09:07,823 --> 00:09:09,758
Doesn't look like a VIN number.

00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:10,759
I was just about to run it.

00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,661
I'll take these.

00:09:14,496 --> 00:09:18,200
RUSSELL: <i>Sin City Secrets</i>
by Greg Sanders.

00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,468
Nice photo.

00:09:19,468 --> 00:09:21,103
Hm.
So I guess you were, uh,

00:09:21,103 --> 00:09:24,039
a big part of her research?

00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:25,173
You didn't even know it, huh?

00:09:26,475 --> 00:09:27,976
SIDLE:
Hey, there you are.

00:09:27,976 --> 00:09:29,678
Wow, those are a lot of boxes.

00:09:29,678 --> 00:09:31,913
Uh, I ran the serial
number on the piano.

00:09:31,913 --> 00:09:33,782
It was built in 1966,

00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:36,451
and the original owner
was a guy named Ledo Wright.

00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:39,688
Wait-- <i>the</i> Ledo Wright?

00:09:39,688 --> 00:09:41,490
I didn't know there
was a "the" involved.

00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:42,691
(wry laugh)

00:09:42,691 --> 00:09:43,725
Well, who is he?

00:09:43,725 --> 00:09:45,026
Only a legend.

00:09:45,026 --> 00:09:46,428
That both of us
have never heard of.

00:09:46,428 --> 00:09:47,429
What is so legendary?

00:09:47,429 --> 00:09:51,800
How he played the piano.

00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,001
And...

00:09:53,001 --> 00:09:54,136
how he was murdered.

00:09:55,704 --> 00:09:58,440
1966.

00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,008
The Golden Age of Vegas.

00:10:00,008 --> 00:10:03,612
The Rat Pack roamed the casinos
and the Mob ran 'em.

00:10:03,612 --> 00:10:07,516
Now, Ledo Wright was a hotshot
young piano player from L.A.,

00:10:07,516 --> 00:10:09,518
playing a week with
Sinatra at the Sands.

00:10:09,518 --> 00:10:11,786
The story goes:
Ledo was hitting on

00:10:11,786 --> 00:10:14,122
one of Sinatra's
dames after the show.

00:10:14,122 --> 00:10:18,460
Grazetti was an aspiring
thumb-breaker for Sam Giancana.

00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:21,763
The new kid in town was also
from Hoboken, so, of course,

00:10:21,763 --> 00:10:24,032
he and Sinatra hit it off.

00:10:24,032 --> 00:10:26,635
Grazetti would have done
anything to impress Frank.

00:10:26,635 --> 00:10:28,036
Grazetti was a real hothead.

00:10:28,036 --> 00:10:29,771
Ledo: no wallflower.

00:10:29,771 --> 00:10:33,508
Both up-and-coming stars
in their own worlds.

00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:35,510
Things went south-- fast.

00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,945
(woman screams)

00:10:39,915 --> 00:10:43,051
Ledo Wright's body
was never found.

00:10:43,051 --> 00:10:45,487
No body, no evidence.

00:10:45,487 --> 00:10:47,822
No charges could be filed.

00:10:47,822 --> 00:10:49,524
What happened to Grazetti?

00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:50,959
Disappeared.

00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,062
Until he popped up in
Jersey, 20 years later.

00:10:54,062 --> 00:10:56,765
But, by then, Ledo was
just a distant memory.

00:10:56,765 --> 00:10:58,733
Well, his piano isn't.

00:10:58,733 --> 00:11:01,670
It's been going to same repair
shop in Los Angeles for years.

00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:04,139
Place was scheduled
to receive it two days ago.

00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:06,441
Moving company's called
"Play On Movers."

00:11:06,441 --> 00:11:09,110
The night that Alison died,
their truck gassed up

00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,579
five miles from the crime scene.

00:11:10,579 --> 00:11:12,080
Who was the driver?

00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,682
RUSSELL:
Lenny Vanders, it says here.

00:11:13,682 --> 00:11:15,884
Former musician.

00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:18,153
I guess all he's playing lately
is "Jailhouse Rock."

00:11:18,153 --> 00:11:19,754
He did two tours at Ely.

00:11:19,754 --> 00:11:21,189
Paroled last year.

00:11:21,189 --> 00:11:23,024
Besides the piano-moving gig,

00:11:23,024 --> 00:11:25,594
he works at a store called
"Back When Music."

00:11:28,964 --> 00:11:31,499
(playing bluesy riff)

00:11:42,611 --> 00:11:44,546
'56 Strat.

00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,115
Plug you in, bro?

00:11:47,115 --> 00:11:48,883
Maybe next time.

00:11:48,883 --> 00:11:49,951
Are you Lenny Vanders?

00:11:49,951 --> 00:11:51,152
I go by Moondog.

00:11:51,152 --> 00:11:53,021
What can I do you for?

00:11:53,021 --> 00:11:54,522
Do you know an Alison Bailey?

00:11:54,522 --> 00:11:55,624
Nope.

00:11:55,624 --> 00:11:56,925
The bells do not ring.

00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:58,126
Are they ringing now?

00:11:58,126 --> 00:11:59,995
Did you move this piano?

00:11:59,995 --> 00:12:02,697
I move a lot of pianos.

00:12:02,697 --> 00:12:04,032
Yo, Clapton,
we have proof

00:12:04,032 --> 00:12:05,934
that you moved this piano
in your truck.

00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:08,770
Dude, look...

00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:11,606
I was supposed to deliver it
to L.A. for repairs.

00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:14,743
The dead girl was definitely not
on the shipping manifesto.

00:12:14,743 --> 00:12:17,045
So how'd she get in the piano?
No clue.

00:12:17,045 --> 00:12:18,913
Look, I stopped to get gas.

00:12:18,913 --> 00:12:23,018
<i>I checked the piano,</i>
<i>went to tighten the straps.</i>

00:12:25,053 --> 00:12:27,789
<i>Next thing I know, I got a dead</i>
<i>girl staring at me.</i>

00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:29,157
BRASS:
<i>And you did the right thing.</i>

00:12:29,157 --> 00:12:30,558
<i>You called the cops, right?</i>

00:12:30,558 --> 00:12:31,559
Look, I panicked.

00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:32,927
I dumped it in the desert.

00:12:32,927 --> 00:12:34,529
Who owns the piano?

00:12:34,529 --> 00:12:36,097
I got it at this old theater.

00:12:36,097 --> 00:12:38,033
That wasn't the question.

00:12:38,033 --> 00:12:41,002
You know that
Witness Protection thing?

00:12:41,002 --> 00:12:43,438
Can I get in on that?
How does that work?

00:12:43,438 --> 00:12:45,507
Who owns the piano, Moondog?

00:12:45,507 --> 00:12:46,708
Tommy Grazetti.

00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:48,176
Tommy Grazetti.
Yeah.

00:12:48,176 --> 00:12:49,911
I thought he was hanging out
in Jersey somewhere.

00:12:49,911 --> 00:12:51,579
Since when did he
come back to Las Vegas?

00:12:51,579 --> 00:12:53,548
How am I supposed to know?

00:12:53,548 --> 00:12:56,718
All I know is he runs this
Rat Pack show at that theater

00:12:56,718 --> 00:12:58,186
and he used to kill people
for a living.

00:12:58,186 --> 00:12:59,854
Yeah, people
like Ledo Wright.

00:12:59,854 --> 00:13:01,656
I think Greg's
onto something.

00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:02,857
If Alison was looking into

00:13:02,857 --> 00:13:06,461
one of Grazetti's
old murders...

00:13:06,461 --> 00:13:07,662
Maybe she's a new one.

00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,135
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

00:13:14,135 --> 00:13:16,838
welcome to the Copa Room
at the Sands!

00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:19,074
Here they are,
straight from the bar--

00:13:19,074 --> 00:13:21,076
Dean, Sammy,

00:13:21,076 --> 00:13:23,745
and the Chairman of
the Board, Frank Sinatra!

00:13:23,745 --> 00:13:25,513
Whoa!

00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:28,016
Hey, how are you this evening,
ladies and gentlemen?

00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:29,751
Ho-ho!

00:13:29,751 --> 00:13:32,020
How'd all these people
get in my room?

00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,788

There's Ledo Wright.

00:14:31,946 --> 00:14:34,949
And look at the date on
the poster-- October 23, 1966.

00:14:34,949 --> 00:14:36,684
Two days before
Ledo was murdered

00:14:36,684 --> 00:14:39,788
by Tommy Grazetti
to get in good with Frank.

00:14:39,788 --> 00:14:42,123

Can I help you?

00:14:53,001 --> 00:14:54,736
Yeah, as a
matter of fact.

00:14:54,736 --> 00:14:56,471
CSI Russell, CSI Sanders,

00:14:56,471 --> 00:14:58,473
Vegas Crime Lab.

00:14:58,473 --> 00:14:59,941
We'd like to talk
to a Tommy Grazetti.

00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:01,576
Yeah, he's out of town.

00:15:01,576 --> 00:15:03,111
So unless you got a
ticket, you got to leave.

00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:04,813
How's this for a ticket?

00:15:04,813 --> 00:15:08,082
SINGER: Hey, ladies and
gentlemen, thank you so much.

00:15:08,082 --> 00:15:10,051
(applause)

00:15:17,992 --> 00:15:19,661
I don't know
what to tell you.

00:15:19,661 --> 00:15:21,830
Piano was taken out
yesterday.

00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:24,632
Guy took it out through
the loading dock.

00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,601
Okay. But it was
right here, right?

00:15:26,601 --> 00:15:27,836
More or less.

00:15:27,836 --> 00:15:29,904
Do me a favor.
On the way out the door,

00:15:29,904 --> 00:15:31,940
turn the lights off,
will you?

00:15:36,611 --> 00:15:38,580
Thank you.

00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:43,117
(sighs)

00:15:54,963 --> 00:15:57,665
I think we found our primary.

00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:00,602
Three voids, identical.

00:16:00,602 --> 00:16:02,504
What are you thinking,
piano legs?

00:16:02,504 --> 00:16:04,138
This is where
Alison was attacked.

00:16:04,138 --> 00:16:05,640
(screams)

00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:11,646
SANDERS:
Missed a spot.

00:16:11,646 --> 00:16:13,715
Blood...

00:16:13,715 --> 00:16:15,850
with a strand of fiber in it.

00:16:16,985 --> 00:16:18,186
Maybe trace from our killer?

00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:19,187
We need some backup.

00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:20,955
I'm gonna text Sara.

00:16:20,955 --> 00:16:23,658
(light switch clicks,
then footsteps approach)

00:16:23,658 --> 00:16:25,660
Oh, look who's here.

00:16:33,067 --> 00:16:35,870
You charge extra
for the cleaning?

00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,039
Mr. Grazetti, uh,
heard you were out of town.

00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,874
Heard you wanted to talk.

00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:41,442
Yeah, yeah, we do.

00:16:41,442 --> 00:16:43,645
You know a lady
named Alison Bailey.

00:16:43,645 --> 00:16:44,979
Is that right?

00:16:44,979 --> 00:16:46,014
Don't recognize
the name.

00:16:46,014 --> 00:16:49,651
How about the face?

00:16:49,651 --> 00:16:51,152
Oh, yeah-- her.
She's a nutjob.

00:16:51,152 --> 00:16:53,821
A few days ago, I'm at
the sports book at Caesar's.

00:16:53,821 --> 00:16:56,824
I got a fresh cigar,
a fresh racing form-- paradise.

00:16:56,824 --> 00:16:58,459
She saddles up next to me,

00:16:58,459 --> 00:17:00,061
asks me questions
about the old days.

00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:02,497
I gave her the shine.
Yeah, and then you

00:17:02,497 --> 00:17:03,998
shined the floor
with her blood.

00:17:03,998 --> 00:17:05,500
Yeah, excuse-- excuse me.

00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,769
Um, where were you
Monday night?

00:17:07,769 --> 00:17:09,637
At home by myself.

00:17:09,637 --> 00:17:10,672
Show's dark on Mondays.

00:17:10,672 --> 00:17:12,574
She found out, didn't she?

00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:15,476
She had proof that you're the
one who killed Ledo Wright.

00:17:15,476 --> 00:17:16,544
(chuckles)

00:17:16,544 --> 00:17:18,079
You're out of line, kid.

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,147
Yeah? And you're a killer.

00:17:19,147 --> 00:17:20,148
All right, you know what?

00:17:20,148 --> 00:17:21,683
Time... time-out.

00:17:21,683 --> 00:17:24,185
Can I talk to you
for a second, please?

00:17:24,185 --> 00:17:25,186
And don't go anywhere.

00:17:25,186 --> 00:17:26,120
We'll be right back.

00:17:29,457 --> 00:17:31,593
What-What are you doing?
The guy did it!

00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:34,028
No, actually, Greg,
he's a suspect.

00:17:34,028 --> 00:17:35,530
There's blood
all over that place!

00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:36,764
All right,
All the more reason

00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,633
to rein it in,
so we can nail him.

00:17:38,633 --> 00:17:39,634
Rein it in?

00:17:39,634 --> 00:17:40,835
Oh, I get it.

00:17:40,835 --> 00:17:42,070
When it's people
that you care about,

00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:43,705
the rule book goes out
the window.

00:17:43,705 --> 00:17:47,609
But when it's someone who
meant something to me...

00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:50,445
Yeah, I should've
told you.

00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:52,180
Yeah, you're right,
you should have.

00:17:53,848 --> 00:17:56,417
And yeah, you're right.

00:17:57,852 --> 00:18:00,054
When Katie was taken, I...

00:18:00,054 --> 00:18:03,024
I led with my heart.

00:18:03,024 --> 00:18:04,492
I didn't know
what to do.

00:18:04,492 --> 00:18:05,793
But I was wrong.

00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,695
It wasn't until
I stopped doing that

00:18:07,695 --> 00:18:09,664
that we were able
to find her.

00:18:09,664 --> 00:18:11,599
Easier said than done.

00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:13,034
Yeah, tell me about it.

00:18:14,736 --> 00:18:16,638
Well, I guess this is

00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:18,973
when you take
me off the case.

00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:20,608
Off the case, no.

00:18:20,608 --> 00:18:23,144
Off the front lines, yeah.

00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:26,114
You think that whatever Alison
found got her killed, right?

00:18:26,114 --> 00:18:31,686
So... take a deep breath
and go out and find it.

00:18:31,686 --> 00:18:34,055
For her.

00:18:34,055 --> 00:18:35,456
Okay?

00:18:50,204 --> 00:18:54,542
(music playing in distance)

00:19:05,653 --> 00:19:07,722
(Frank Sinatra song playing)

00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:38,419
♪ ♪

00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:45,526
Hey, I don't go on
for another 20.

00:19:45,526 --> 00:19:47,095
Sinatra needs his rest.

00:19:47,095 --> 00:19:50,431
(needle scrapes, song stops)

00:19:50,431 --> 00:19:51,165
Show's over, Frank.

00:19:54,001 --> 00:19:56,738
BRASS: You know, I don't know
why the DMV gets this so wrong.

00:19:56,738 --> 00:19:57,972
They got you down here

00:19:57,972 --> 00:19:59,507
as some schmuck named
Jeff Lummet.

00:19:59,507 --> 00:20:00,942
Someone gonna tell me
why I'm here?

00:20:03,544 --> 00:20:05,146
Oh, my God.

00:20:05,146 --> 00:20:08,716
I take it you know her, Jeff?
That's Alison Bailey.

00:20:08,716 --> 00:20:10,718
I met her a couple
years ago.

00:20:10,718 --> 00:20:13,755
I helped her with her
Sinatra biography.

00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:15,189
Oh...

00:20:15,189 --> 00:20:16,824
I'm a, I'm a
memorabilia collector.

00:20:16,824 --> 00:20:18,860
There were some items
that she wanted to see.

00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,895
Have you seen her more recently
than that?

00:20:20,895 --> 00:20:22,530
Maybe in the
little love nest

00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:24,766
they have under
the theater there.

00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:26,434
It's not a love nest,
all right?

00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:28,770
It's a listening room.

00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,138
And it's not mine,
it's Tommy's.

00:20:30,138 --> 00:20:32,206
So you and Tommy have
a little listening room.

00:20:32,206 --> 00:20:34,208
Someplace where
nobody listens.

00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:35,476
You were partying down there,

00:20:35,476 --> 00:20:36,744
and maybe things got out
of hand.

00:20:36,744 --> 00:20:38,179
Hey, hey, hey, wait a minute.

00:20:38,179 --> 00:20:39,580
Whatever happened
to Alison,

00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,149
I had nothing
to do about it.

00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,756
Oh, man.
It <i>is</i> my fault.

00:20:48,756 --> 00:20:50,591
I told her where
to find Tommy.

00:20:50,591 --> 00:20:52,593
At Caesars.

00:20:52,593 --> 00:20:54,962
Oh! I warned her.

00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:57,064
Told her not to talk to
Tommy about his past.

00:20:57,064 --> 00:20:58,900
It's a bad idea.

00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,135
Laying around in blood and
fibers at a crime scene--

00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:03,504
that is a bad idea.

00:21:03,504 --> 00:21:05,506
Where were you Monday night?

00:21:05,506 --> 00:21:06,741
I was working at the Avalon.

00:21:06,741 --> 00:21:08,075
That's a hip-hop club, Jeff.

00:21:08,075 --> 00:21:09,811
I mean, they're
not Sinatra fans there.

00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:11,913
I wasn't singing.

00:21:11,913 --> 00:21:13,815
I was spotting.

00:21:13,815 --> 00:21:15,149
Here.

00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:17,118
Note Seek.

00:21:17,118 --> 00:21:20,788
That's an app
that identifies songs.

00:21:20,788 --> 00:21:22,857
Charlie actually just
showed me how to use this.

00:21:22,857 --> 00:21:24,492
It's really cool.

00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:26,961
Note Seek has this
database of songs

00:21:26,961 --> 00:21:32,934
that are catalogued by
artist, year and title.

00:21:32,934 --> 00:21:36,938
Then you take your app
and you digitally listen

00:21:36,938 --> 00:21:38,639
to a snippet of music...

00:21:40,074 --> 00:21:43,177
(Sinatra song playing)

00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:45,513
And then it tells
you exactly what

00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:47,415
you're listening to.

00:21:47,415 --> 00:21:48,983
How cool is that?
I thought you were more of

00:21:48,983 --> 00:21:50,184
a Grateful Dead kind of guy.

00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:51,686
No, I am, I am.

00:21:51,686 --> 00:21:53,054
This is just research.

00:21:53,054 --> 00:21:55,022
Barbara's the Sinatra fan.

00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:57,525
This one, we actually

00:21:57,525 --> 00:21:59,427
learned how to dance
to that song

00:21:59,427 --> 00:22:02,029
at an Arthur Murray studio.

00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,564
Barbara wanted us
to learn how to dance

00:22:03,564 --> 00:22:04,866
for Maya's wedding.

00:22:04,866 --> 00:22:05,900
It was fun, too.

00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,969
How are you guys doing?

00:22:07,969 --> 00:22:09,036
We're good. We're good.

00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,037
Thank you. Yeah.

00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:11,505
She's still flying up

00:22:11,505 --> 00:22:13,574
to Seattle every
weekend, but...

00:22:13,574 --> 00:22:15,977
Well, that must be really
good for Maya and Katie.

00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:19,981
Yeah, I hope so.

00:22:19,981 --> 00:22:24,552
So, how does Note Seek
alibi Lummet?

00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:26,087
I had to look
that one up, actually.

00:22:26,087 --> 00:22:29,857
Um... the company has
these music spotters

00:22:29,857 --> 00:22:31,859
that they send out to clubs

00:22:31,859 --> 00:22:33,861
to listen and record
new songs and remixes

00:22:33,861 --> 00:22:35,196
for the database.

00:22:35,196 --> 00:22:37,465
And Lummet did say that
he was music spotting

00:22:37,465 --> 00:22:38,933
on Monday night at the club.

00:22:38,933 --> 00:22:42,637
And an exec from Note Seek
confirmed his story.

00:22:42,637 --> 00:22:45,006
Lummet turned in his playlist.

00:22:45,006 --> 00:22:47,208
So I guess we no longer
have a suspect.
Guess not.

00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:48,209
(record skipping)

00:22:48,209 --> 00:22:49,777
Oh, Lord.

00:22:49,777 --> 00:22:51,846
You don't get that
with MP3s, do you?

00:22:57,752 --> 00:22:58,719
FINLAY:
What?

00:23:00,855 --> 00:23:04,091
I have a... I have a box cutter
in that left-hand drawer.

00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:06,027
Can I have it, please?
Sure.

00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:11,966
Forgive me, Barbara,
but it's for a good cause.

00:23:21,976 --> 00:23:23,477
Does that look familiar?

00:23:23,477 --> 00:23:26,814
Vinyl trace
Greg found in the piano.

00:23:26,814 --> 00:23:30,017
Same as Doc found
in the victim's wounds.

00:23:30,017 --> 00:23:31,953
Vinyl tracings,
box cutters...

00:23:31,953 --> 00:23:35,856
Maybe a record played
a part in Alison's death.

00:23:43,664 --> 00:23:45,800
Wow.

00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,169
You have done a lot of
work in here, Greg.

00:23:48,169 --> 00:23:49,937
None of this makes any sense.

00:23:49,937 --> 00:23:52,006
I thought that Alison
was researching

00:23:52,006 --> 00:23:55,009
Tommy Grazetti's involvement
in the Ledo Wright murder,

00:23:55,009 --> 00:23:56,911
but there is nothing
in here about Ledo Wright.

00:23:58,713 --> 00:24:00,047
So what was
she researching?

00:24:00,047 --> 00:24:02,416
Well, she was definitely
interested in Grazetti,

00:24:02,416 --> 00:24:03,818
but most of these files are

00:24:03,818 --> 00:24:06,687
about the Mob moving
into drug dealing,

00:24:06,687 --> 00:24:08,656
or making inroads
with the hippie crowd.

00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:10,558
Tell me you got something.

00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:11,559
Yeah.

00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:13,194
I've got Alison's car.

00:24:13,194 --> 00:24:15,529
The rental car company

00:24:15,529 --> 00:24:17,698
turned over the GPS files
for the vehicle.

00:24:17,698 --> 00:24:19,834
As you can see,
most of her trips

00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:21,869
were right around the Strip,

00:24:21,869 --> 00:24:23,704
but on the day
she was murdered,

00:24:23,704 --> 00:24:26,741
she takes a ride to an
abandoned house in Henderson.

00:24:26,741 --> 00:24:28,476
"850 Timber Lane."

00:24:28,476 --> 00:24:30,144
Yeah, does that mean something?

00:24:33,414 --> 00:24:34,682
Here it is.

00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:36,050
October 26, 1966.

00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:39,920
Tommy Grazetti walks
into 850 Timber Lane.

00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,589
What is this,
FBI surveillance?
No.

00:24:41,589 --> 00:24:43,124
That's Sam Braun surveillance.

00:24:43,124 --> 00:24:45,493
Braun had a P.I.
tailing Grazetti.

00:24:45,493 --> 00:24:46,861
Well, why would
Sam be following him?

00:24:46,861 --> 00:24:48,796
850 Timber Lane.

00:24:48,796 --> 00:24:51,766
The house was owned
by a Linda Overton.

00:24:51,766 --> 00:24:53,434
She was a trust-fund kid

00:24:53,434 --> 00:24:54,635
turned violent radical.

00:24:54,635 --> 00:24:56,504
Robbed Braun's
Rampart Casino

00:24:56,504 --> 00:24:58,105
in '66, killed two guards.

00:24:58,105 --> 00:24:59,707
Died of cancer in '95.

00:24:59,707 --> 00:25:03,444
The cops never found any of
her co-conspirators.

00:25:03,444 --> 00:25:05,012
Maybe Alison did.

00:25:05,012 --> 00:25:07,014
Tommy Grazetti.

00:25:07,014 --> 00:25:08,649
Yeah, this whole time
I have been thinking

00:25:08,649 --> 00:25:10,918
that the Ledo Wright murder
got Alison killed.

00:25:10,918 --> 00:25:14,522
Maybe Tommy Grazetti was
helping radicals rob a casino.

00:25:14,522 --> 00:25:16,857
I've been looking
at the wrong '60s.

00:25:23,998 --> 00:25:26,000
You should've stayed
in Jersey, Tommy.

00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,836
But I guess everyone's past

00:25:28,836 --> 00:25:31,505
has a way of catching up
to all of us, huh?

00:25:31,505 --> 00:25:34,108
I don't even know
what I'm looking at.

00:25:34,108 --> 00:25:36,010
You're looking at a crook.

00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:36,977
And a murderer.

00:25:36,977 --> 00:25:38,612
Sam Braun knew it.

00:25:38,612 --> 00:25:40,948
That's why he had his P.I.
take that photo of you

00:25:40,948 --> 00:25:43,551
paying Linda Overton
a little vist.

00:25:43,551 --> 00:25:45,519
Take a look at
the date stamp, there.

00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:48,889
October 26, 1966.

00:25:48,889 --> 00:25:51,859
That's three days before
the Rampart casino was robbed

00:25:51,859 --> 00:25:53,461
and two guards were killed.

00:25:53,461 --> 00:25:54,462
Tragic.

00:25:54,462 --> 00:25:55,729
Historic.

00:25:55,729 --> 00:25:56,997
I had nothing
to do with it.

00:25:58,566 --> 00:26:00,134
STOKES: Just like you had
nothing to do with

00:26:00,134 --> 00:26:01,936
Alison Bailey's murder.

00:26:01,936 --> 00:26:03,537
Now, forget about
the piano player--

00:26:03,537 --> 00:26:05,606
Ledo Wright.

00:26:05,606 --> 00:26:07,141
It was easy to
make him disappear.

00:26:07,141 --> 00:26:09,510
But this... ooh.

00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:12,680
Well, that's a different
story, isn't it?

00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,850
I think that you hightailed it

00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:17,685
out of Vegas in '66

00:26:17,685 --> 00:26:20,821
because you stole from Sam Braun
and killed two of his boys.

00:26:20,821 --> 00:26:23,124
40 years later,

00:26:23,124 --> 00:26:25,726
Alison dug up the truth,

00:26:25,726 --> 00:26:27,094
and you killed her for it.

00:26:27,094 --> 00:26:29,597
I was also the guy
on the grassy knoll.

00:26:29,597 --> 00:26:31,098
Did you find that
in her research?

00:26:31,098 --> 00:26:33,801
No, but I can tell you
what I think I'm gonna find.

00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:35,569
The name of a co-conspirator

00:26:35,569 --> 00:26:37,638
who was in on the heist

00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:39,773
with you and Overton.

00:26:40,875 --> 00:26:42,910
You like the word "allegedly"?

00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:44,645
It's a favorite of mine.

00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:45,980
Now, you just told me
a little story

00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:48,048
about Vegas in '66.

00:26:48,048 --> 00:26:49,984
I'll tell you one.

00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:52,686
In '66, we're running
the casinos.

00:26:52,686 --> 00:26:55,456
Skimming, loan-sharking...

00:26:55,456 --> 00:26:57,057
you know, allegedly.

00:26:57,057 --> 00:26:59,527
Life is good.

00:26:59,527 --> 00:27:01,595
And then Howard Hughes
buys the Sands.

00:27:01,595 --> 00:27:03,030
Makes it all legit.

00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:06,033
Not even Sinatra
could get comp'd.

00:27:06,033 --> 00:27:09,036
Yeah, sure, we still
hit the Sands every day.

00:27:09,036 --> 00:27:12,173
But not like
players, kings-- no.

00:27:12,173 --> 00:27:13,841
All we could do was

00:27:13,841 --> 00:27:17,178
play the nickel slots like
a bunch of old ladies.

00:27:17,178 --> 00:27:20,548
We had to come up with a
different revenue source--

00:27:20,548 --> 00:27:21,482
drugs.

00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,884
Allegedly.

00:27:23,884 --> 00:27:26,620
You're telling me
you're a drug dealer,

00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,189
not a murderer.

00:27:28,189 --> 00:27:30,157
I'm not telling you anything.

00:27:30,157 --> 00:27:34,161
Except for Linda Overton was
one hot hippie piece of ass.

00:27:34,161 --> 00:27:36,430
(laughs)

00:27:40,067 --> 00:27:42,002
(hip-hop music playing)

00:27:56,183 --> 00:27:58,652
(scratching)

00:27:58,652 --> 00:28:00,621
Do you play weddings, too?

00:28:01,956 --> 00:28:04,625
I'm not playing, dawg.

00:28:04,625 --> 00:28:05,826
I'm cleaning.

00:28:05,826 --> 00:28:07,061
(laughing)

00:28:07,061 --> 00:28:08,762
What are you
talking about?

00:28:08,762 --> 00:28:11,498
Well, as much as it pains me
to admit, I was wrong

00:28:11,498 --> 00:28:13,634
about the glue that
he found in the piano.

00:28:13,634 --> 00:28:16,770
I think our killer used it
to clean a record.

00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:18,572
Wouldn't that mess
the record up?

00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:20,140
Not if you follow
this simple recipe:

00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,709
You take one LP album,

00:28:21,709 --> 00:28:27,181
add four ounces
of store-bought hide glue.

00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:33,621
Spread evenly

00:28:33,621 --> 00:28:36,957
across the vinyl.

00:28:36,957 --> 00:28:40,461
In time, dust and particles
affix to the glue.

00:28:40,461 --> 00:28:42,463
After the glue dries,

00:28:42,463 --> 00:28:44,498
you take a handy box cutter,

00:28:44,498 --> 00:28:46,500
and use it to pry the glue

00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,737
off of the record.

00:28:49,737 --> 00:28:51,438
And...

00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:52,673
voilà,

00:28:52,673 --> 00:28:54,775
a perfectly clean record.

00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:56,443
RUSSELL:
You also got a perfect negative

00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:59,580
of the record's grooves,
just like these.

00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,749
We got the grooves,

00:29:01,749 --> 00:29:03,851
why don't we just play
the damn thing?

00:29:03,851 --> 00:29:06,186
"Name That Tune,"
name that killer.

00:29:25,105 --> 00:29:26,907
(beep)

00:29:26,907 --> 00:29:28,876
SIDLE:
<i>I was able to assemble</i>
<i>and reconstruct</i>

00:29:28,876 --> 00:29:30,978
four separate audio segments
from the glue.

00:29:30,978 --> 00:29:32,579
This is what I got.

00:29:32,579 --> 00:29:33,981
Track One.

00:29:33,981 --> 00:29:35,616
(applause)

00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,884
Live album, maybe?

00:29:36,884 --> 00:29:38,819
Track Two.

00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:39,920
(snippet of music plays)

00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,555
Jazz, maybe?

00:29:41,555 --> 00:29:43,557
There were vocals, too.

00:29:43,557 --> 00:29:44,558
Track Three.

00:29:44,558 --> 00:29:46,860
(male voice sings one note)

00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:49,096
I got the most
out of this track.

00:29:49,096 --> 00:29:51,065
(slow, jazzy instrumental
plays briefly)

00:29:51,065 --> 00:29:52,466
That's all I got.

00:29:52,466 --> 00:29:53,834
I mean,
if it were a Radiohead song,

00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:55,836
I could help you, but...
No, wait a minute,

00:29:55,836 --> 00:29:57,638
wait a minute, I...
let me use my app here.

00:29:57,638 --> 00:29:58,939
God, I love this thing.

00:29:58,939 --> 00:30:02,009
(imitating Bogart):
Play it again, Sara.

00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:03,010
(instrumental plays)

00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:04,511
(beep)

00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:05,913
Ah!

00:30:05,913 --> 00:30:07,681
<i>Sinatra at the Sands.</i>

00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:09,516
Classic album.

00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:11,085
Seems whenever this case
takes a turn,

00:30:11,085 --> 00:30:13,620
it's always back to 1966.

00:30:22,696 --> 00:30:23,997
Taking a music break?

00:30:23,997 --> 00:30:25,833
Listen to this.

00:30:25,833 --> 00:30:29,536
GRAZETTI:
Yeah, sure, we still
hit the Sands every day.

00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:32,139
But not like
players, kings-- no.

00:30:32,139 --> 00:30:34,441
Grazetti's interrogation?

00:30:34,441 --> 00:30:36,610
Yeah. I've been listening to it
for the last couple hours.

00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:38,178
The guy's lying.

00:30:38,178 --> 00:30:40,681
You didn't expect him
to admit to killing Alison.

00:30:40,681 --> 00:30:42,483
No, I'm not talking
about Alison.

00:30:42,483 --> 00:30:44,952
I'm talking about
the Sands in '66.

00:30:44,952 --> 00:30:46,186
Grazetti said that he was

00:30:46,186 --> 00:30:47,855
"hanging with the boys"
in the casino.

00:30:49,022 --> 00:30:50,023
That's impossible.

00:30:50,023 --> 00:30:51,091
Why?

00:30:51,091 --> 00:30:52,526
The Vegas Black Book.

00:30:52,526 --> 00:30:54,027
It's a list of
all the people banned

00:30:54,027 --> 00:30:55,429
by the Gaming Commission.

00:30:55,429 --> 00:30:57,464
In 1965, Tommy Grazetti

00:30:57,464 --> 00:30:59,466
was busted for counting cards.

00:30:59,466 --> 00:31:02,102
He was banned from
the Sands after that.

00:31:02,102 --> 00:31:03,971
So there's no way
he was hanging with the boys

00:31:03,971 --> 00:31:05,038
in the casino.

00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:06,840
But why would he lie about that?

00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,743
Maybe... he forgot.

00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:11,812
Trust me, guys like Grazetti

00:31:11,812 --> 00:31:14,815
don't forget
about their Vegas glory days.

00:31:14,815 --> 00:31:16,417
In fact, they
spend more time

00:31:16,417 --> 00:31:18,986
living in the past
than in the present.

00:31:18,986 --> 00:31:21,822
Kind of... sounds like
you're talking about yourself

00:31:21,822 --> 00:31:23,457
more than Grazetti.

00:31:23,457 --> 00:31:25,459
What's that supposed to mean?

00:31:25,459 --> 00:31:27,127
Greg...

00:31:27,127 --> 00:31:30,998
your... passion
for Vegas history is awesome.

00:31:32,466 --> 00:31:34,635
It makes you a
better CSI, right?

00:31:36,437 --> 00:31:38,739
And... I'm...

00:31:38,739 --> 00:31:40,207
the last person

00:31:40,207 --> 00:31:42,209
who should be giving
relationship advice, but...

00:31:42,209 --> 00:31:44,144
I mean, look at
you, you're...

00:31:44,144 --> 00:31:46,680
you're a hot guy;
you're smart, you're funny,

00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,048
you're... a total catch.

00:31:49,716 --> 00:31:51,852
What I'm saying is...
with Alison,

00:31:51,852 --> 00:31:54,154
with your obsession
with the past, maybe...

00:31:55,756 --> 00:31:58,592
...you should stop looking back,
you know? Try...

00:31:58,592 --> 00:32:00,194
moving forward.

00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:06,433
You're right.

00:32:07,568 --> 00:32:08,902
You are the last person

00:32:08,902 --> 00:32:10,771
who should be giving
relationship advice.

00:32:10,771 --> 00:32:12,506
(chuckles softly)

00:32:12,506 --> 00:32:14,141
All I'm saying is,
with my parents' divorce,

00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:16,710
I couldn't get past it;
I-I thought of my father

00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:18,512
as this one guy,

00:32:18,512 --> 00:32:20,147
and...

00:32:20,147 --> 00:32:22,749
I came to realize he was
a completely different person.

00:32:23,884 --> 00:32:25,719
You know, maybe...
Wait.

00:32:25,719 --> 00:32:27,154
What you just said.

00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:36,830
Thank you.

00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,135
You're welcome.

00:32:59,152 --> 00:33:01,121
(spritzing)

00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:18,005
I think you're gonna be
a little late for that show.

00:33:18,005 --> 00:33:19,439
Yeah, well, not for
Ledo Wright's thumbprint.

00:33:21,508 --> 00:33:23,777
RUSSELL:
You're kidding me.

00:33:23,777 --> 00:33:25,779
A 46-year-old print?

00:33:25,779 --> 00:33:28,715
You're gonna make
the <i>Journal of Forensic Science.</i>

00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:30,083
I'm gonna make more
than that, bubby.

00:33:30,083 --> 00:33:32,085
Look at that photo
of Ledo Wright.

00:33:32,085 --> 00:33:34,021
See the ring on
his finger?
Yeah.

00:33:34,021 --> 00:33:37,157
Ledo always wore an
Irish Claddagh ring.

00:33:37,157 --> 00:33:39,593
Now, I blew up this photo
of Tommy Grazetti

00:33:39,593 --> 00:33:41,828
in front of Linda
Overton's house.

00:33:41,828 --> 00:33:43,530
What's on his hand?

00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:46,099
An Irish Claddagh ring.

00:33:46,099 --> 00:33:47,834
What is Grazetti doing
with an Irish ring?

00:33:47,834 --> 00:33:49,069
He's Italian as pasta.

00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:51,071
Because it's the same guy.

00:33:51,071 --> 00:33:53,707
So maybe it's the other
way around--

00:33:53,707 --> 00:33:55,042
maybe Ledo Wright
killed Grazetti.

00:33:55,042 --> 00:33:56,944
And assumed his identity.

00:33:56,944 --> 00:33:58,745
It's a good story.

00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:00,480
One I am going to prove.

00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,782
Now, Nick already got

00:34:01,782 --> 00:34:03,617
Grazetti's print
when he brought him in,

00:34:03,617 --> 00:34:05,886
and now we have
Ledo Wright's print
from the poster.

00:34:08,989 --> 00:34:10,924
RUSSELL:
Wow.

00:34:10,924 --> 00:34:13,060
Hey, that's
great work, Greg.

00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:15,796
For 46 years,
Ledo's been hiding.

00:34:15,796 --> 00:34:17,731
Alison found him,
and that got her killed.

00:34:17,731 --> 00:34:20,534
The guy putting on
the fake Rat Pack show is

00:34:20,534 --> 00:34:22,569
the biggest fake of 'em all.

00:34:27,207 --> 00:34:30,644
(piano playing gentle melody)

00:34:58,071 --> 00:35:01,808
That's a Ledo Wright flourish
if I ever heard one.

00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:06,013
Same build,
same looks,

00:35:06,013 --> 00:35:08,415
a few nips and tucks.

00:35:08,415 --> 00:35:11,018
But you couldn't change
your fingerprints.

00:35:11,018 --> 00:35:13,687
It all made sense.

00:35:13,687 --> 00:35:15,789
The legend.

00:35:15,789 --> 00:35:18,058
"Gangster kills piano player."

00:35:18,058 --> 00:35:19,726
(chuckles)

00:35:19,726 --> 00:35:20,761
But Alison...

00:35:20,761 --> 00:35:23,830
discovered the truth.

00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:27,534
I didn't kill Allison.

00:35:27,534 --> 00:35:30,137
I didn't kill anyone.

00:35:30,137 --> 00:35:33,840
Not wanting to kill is how this
whole damn thing got started.

00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,742
1966 was a...

00:35:35,742 --> 00:35:40,080
a very good year for an
up-and-coming piano player,

00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:44,184
but a very bad year if you drew
the wrong number in the draft.

00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:47,921
I thought my only choice
was to go to Canada.

00:35:47,921 --> 00:35:49,923
And then... (chuckles)

00:35:49,923 --> 00:35:51,725
fate stepped in.

00:35:51,725 --> 00:35:53,560
<i>It was just another night</i>
<i>in paradise,</i>

00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,995
<i>hanging out with the boys.</i>

00:35:54,995 --> 00:35:58,432
<i>Yeah, Tommy and I,</i>
<i>we had our differences,</i>

00:35:58,432 --> 00:36:00,200
<i>but we made up.</i>

00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:03,670
<i>We always told Tommy,</i>
<i>"Swallow first,</i>

00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:05,906
<i>then flap your gums."</i>

00:36:05,906 --> 00:36:06,907
(choking)

00:36:06,907 --> 00:36:09,443
<i>It all happened so fast.</i>

00:36:09,443 --> 00:36:10,944
Tommy, get up, man.
What are you doing?

00:36:10,944 --> 00:36:14,514
<i>We tried to revive Tommy,</i>
<i>but it was no use.</i>

00:36:14,514 --> 00:36:17,718
He was gone.

00:36:17,718 --> 00:36:19,019
And I was supposed to

00:36:19,019 --> 00:36:21,855
report for basic training
in two days.

00:36:21,855 --> 00:36:24,825
And the boys, they come up
with this crazy idea.

00:36:24,825 --> 00:36:26,426
And the more I thought
about it,

00:36:26,426 --> 00:36:30,831
the less crazy it got.

00:36:30,831 --> 00:36:33,667
Tommy was the same height,
same build.

00:36:33,667 --> 00:36:36,470
I dyed my hair,

00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:39,439
(lowers voice):
made a few adjustments.

00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,708
Showtime.

00:36:41,708 --> 00:36:43,577
Why'd you come back to town?

00:36:43,577 --> 00:36:45,846
Vegas.

00:36:45,846 --> 00:36:48,448
At least the Vegas I remember.

00:36:48,448 --> 00:36:50,417
Frank and the boys,

00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:53,820
the songs... the attitude.

00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,889
(chuckles)

00:36:55,889 --> 00:36:57,491
Man, it was magic.

00:36:57,491 --> 00:37:03,764
And now... I get to bring
that back to life

00:37:03,764 --> 00:37:06,867
every night... right here.

00:37:06,867 --> 00:37:09,136
SANDERS:
<i>Ledo Wright's story</i>
<i>checked out.</i>

00:37:09,136 --> 00:37:11,505
He put me onto
a 1966 John Doe.

00:37:11,505 --> 00:37:14,441
C.O.D.: asphyxiation
due to...

00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:16,810
...chicken bone.
And you believe this guy?

00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:19,012
Well, I believe Ledo Wright
isn't a killer.

00:37:19,012 --> 00:37:20,580
Well, hell,
somebody cut up

00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,916
that girl and put her in
the piano.

00:37:22,916 --> 00:37:25,685
Hey, guys, I've been doing
some research on our album,

00:37:25,685 --> 00:37:27,420
<i>Sinatra at the Sands.</i>

00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,656
Turns out it is
a very rare pressing.

00:37:29,656 --> 00:37:30,991
RUSSELL:
Go on.

00:37:30,991 --> 00:37:33,059
<i>Every vinyl record is imprinted</i>

00:37:33,059 --> 00:37:34,961

You remember the number sequence

in Alison's
appointment book?

00:37:42,502 --> 00:37:44,571
It's the same number.

a thousand copies.

Came back for the Strat?
Sweet.

00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:58,819
Actually, I'm looking
for a record.

You move a lot of records.

You got that
right, dude.

00:38:06,026 --> 00:38:08,428
But I did move that,
couple days ago.

00:38:08,428 --> 00:38:10,564

He said it was a gift for--
his words-- "a hot dame."

00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:24,711
What a tool.

00:38:24,711 --> 00:38:26,179

No, no, no, not this one.

This is 180-gram vinyl.

That's right. You were recording
some songs using Note Seek?

00:38:52,072 --> 00:38:54,774
They gave us a copy, I think,
