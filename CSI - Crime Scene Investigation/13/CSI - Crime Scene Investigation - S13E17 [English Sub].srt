00:10:35,027 --> 00:10:37,463
Smell of alcohol.

00:10:37,463 --> 00:10:41,867
Presence of a partially-digested
bready substance.

00:10:41,867 --> 00:10:44,970
It's a crab puff.

00:10:46,638 --> 00:10:48,874
Didn't you eat, like,
seven of them

00:10:48,874 --> 00:10:52,077
while you were lurking
around in the corners?

00:10:52,077 --> 00:10:55,547
I can't believe
you get to see me naked.

00:10:55,547 --> 00:10:57,850
Phillip Davis, rando weirdo

00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:01,019
who probably had a
massive crush on me.

00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:02,454
This is my job.

00:11:02,454 --> 00:11:05,124
I am the assistant
medical examiner.

00:11:05,124 --> 00:11:08,760
They throw you that title
instead of your 50 cent raise?

00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,862
If you're so smart,

00:11:09,862 --> 00:11:11,063
how come you're not a doctor?

00:11:11,063 --> 00:11:12,764
Well, I was planning
on being one...

00:11:12,764 --> 00:11:14,500
Phil.

00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,634
Concentrate.

00:11:15,634 --> 00:11:17,636
Don't mutilate.

00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:18,937
It's David.

00:11:18,937 --> 00:11:20,439
And I didn't have
a crush on you,

00:11:20,439 --> 00:11:22,474
I had a crush
on Lizzie Burns, so...

00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:23,709
Concentrate, Phil.

00:11:23,709 --> 00:11:24,710
(door opens)

00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:25,944
David.

00:11:25,944 --> 00:11:27,579
ROBBINS:
David?

00:11:27,579 --> 00:11:28,981
Everything okay?

00:11:28,981 --> 00:11:31,116
Yeah. Uh, fine.

00:11:31,116 --> 00:11:32,484
Uh, fine, Doc.

00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:33,852
Um, stomach lining...

00:11:33,852 --> 00:11:35,988
uh, the stomach
lining exhibits

00:11:35,988 --> 00:11:37,623
a crater-shaped sore.

00:11:37,623 --> 00:11:39,791
It's approximately
12 millimeters.

00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:42,728
It looks like
a peptic ulcer.

00:11:42,728 --> 00:11:44,930
One centimeter
diameter erosion

00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:47,966
of the lower
esophageal sphincter.

00:11:47,966 --> 00:11:49,468
Could be acid reflux.

00:11:49,468 --> 00:11:51,470
Exacerbated by stress.

00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:52,638
Or alcohol consumption.

00:11:52,638 --> 00:11:54,640
<i>One</i> vodka tonic.

00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,708
Moving on to
the throat.

00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:57,709
The, uh...

00:11:57,709 --> 00:11:59,811
epiglottis is inflamed.

00:11:59,811 --> 00:12:03,415
Likely result of the trauma
from the laceration.

00:12:03,415 --> 00:12:05,417
Majority of
the sharp-force trauma

00:12:05,417 --> 00:12:07,119
is centered in
the trachea.

00:12:07,119 --> 00:12:09,721
An irregular cut
through the adjacent tissue,

00:12:09,721 --> 00:12:11,890
transecting the carotid artery.

00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:13,725
Also noting
an incidental

00:12:13,725 --> 00:12:16,094
injury to the victim's lip.

00:12:16,094 --> 00:12:17,596
Possible cold sore,

00:12:17,596 --> 00:12:19,831
often associated with...
Don't even.

00:12:19,831 --> 00:12:21,033
...herpes outbreak.

00:12:21,033 --> 00:12:22,434
BECCA:
Charming.

00:12:22,434 --> 00:12:23,468
No wonder you didn't start

00:12:23,468 --> 00:12:25,470
dating until you were 26.

00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:27,639
25, technically.

00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:28,640
Pardon?

00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,742
Uh, nothing, uh...

00:12:30,742 --> 00:12:33,412
Likely C.O.D is
exsanguination caused by

00:12:33,412 --> 00:12:35,013
the transection
of the carotid artery.

00:12:35,013 --> 00:12:38,750
Gee, you think the giant gorge
ripped through my throat

00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,918
might have done it?

00:12:39,918 --> 00:12:43,055

She was fine.
Went back to the party.

You know, a stupid little game
may ruffle some feathers,

00:14:29,795 --> 00:14:31,997

Becca's husband...

Grady Foster.
Yes, we spoke to him.

00:14:39,471 --> 00:14:40,472
He's a therapist.

00:14:40,472 --> 00:14:41,540
Mm-hmm.

00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:44,776
He's <i>my</i> therapist.

00:14:44,776 --> 00:14:46,578
I had no idea I was
pouring my secrets out

00:14:46,578 --> 00:14:48,447
to the husband
of the gossip queen,

00:14:48,447 --> 00:14:51,616
until I saw the two of them
walk into the party together.

00:14:53,652 --> 00:14:54,753
I'm on that card.

00:14:57,489 --> 00:14:58,457
Klepto.

00:15:04,963 --> 00:15:06,331
Good.

00:15:06,331 --> 00:15:08,467
I didn't kill Becca.

00:15:08,467 --> 00:15:09,935
But I bet anything

00:15:09,935 --> 00:15:12,404
there are other alums
who are patients of Grady.

00:15:12,404 --> 00:15:13,672
RUSSELL:
Whose secrets ended up

00:15:13,672 --> 00:15:15,507
on Becca's bingo card.

00:15:15,507 --> 00:15:18,643
Would give any of them a reason
to stick a knife in her throat.

00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:27,919
So, I just spoke
with Grady Foster.

00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:31,123
He refused to divulge any of
the names of his patients.

00:15:31,123 --> 00:15:32,624
Confidentiality.

00:15:32,624 --> 00:15:34,893
And he insisted
that his wife knew nothing

00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:36,528
about what happened
in those sessions.

00:15:36,528 --> 00:15:37,763
So Becca, what,

00:15:37,763 --> 00:15:39,064
just guessed
at all these secrets?

00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:40,432
Maybe.

00:15:40,432 --> 00:15:41,900
Okay. So, the
one patient

00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,802
we do know...
Klepto Kelly.

00:15:43,802 --> 00:15:46,605
Right. Has an alibi.

00:15:46,605 --> 00:15:49,074
The photos from the
partygoers' cameras

00:15:49,074 --> 00:15:50,575
put her at
the far side

00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:53,111
of the room
for the 15 minutes before

00:15:53,111 --> 00:15:55,847
the bloody bubbles
actually start to appear.

00:15:55,847 --> 00:15:56,982
So, she may be guilty

00:15:56,982 --> 00:15:58,850
of a few misdemeanors,

00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:01,119
but she certainly
didn't kill anybody.

00:16:01,119 --> 00:16:04,022
Anybody on this card
with a secret had motive.

00:16:04,022 --> 00:16:05,757
Even if Becca was guessing,

00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:08,126
the people with the secrets
did not know that.

00:16:08,126 --> 00:16:10,028
But if Grady won't help
us, there's no way for us

00:16:10,028 --> 00:16:11,863
to determine who
those people are.

00:16:11,863 --> 00:16:14,366
Hmm.
Did David say anything
about the card?

00:16:14,366 --> 00:16:16,568
He said he didn't want to

00:16:16,568 --> 00:16:18,637
"disparage anybody
by guessing."

00:16:18,637 --> 00:16:20,372
His words.

00:16:20,372 --> 00:16:21,373
A true gentleman.
Mm.

00:16:21,373 --> 00:16:22,741
(cell phone ringing)

00:16:22,741 --> 00:16:24,576
He's really hoping he can
help solve this one.

00:16:24,576 --> 00:16:26,545
Well, if it helps us catch
a killer, I'm all for it.

00:16:26,545 --> 00:16:27,779
Nick needs me.
Bye.

00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:29,481
Uh, figured out a
way to determine

00:16:29,481 --> 00:16:31,750
which alumni are patients
of Becca's husband.

00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,652
Which makes them
all suspects, right?

00:16:33,652 --> 00:16:35,420
Theory to beat.

00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,355
STOKES:
Surveillance footage

00:16:37,355 --> 00:16:40,125
from a gas station
next to Grady's therapy office.

00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:42,060
Catches the whole parking lot.

00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,528
Very smart.

00:16:43,528 --> 00:16:44,863
STOKES:
Catalog the license plates

00:16:44,863 --> 00:16:47,098
of all the cars
entering the lot,

00:16:47,098 --> 00:16:49,668
run them through DMV
against the alumni's cars.

00:16:49,668 --> 00:16:51,570
(chuckles)
Nice one, bud.

00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:53,705
STOKES: Yeah, I thought
you might like that.

00:16:53,705 --> 00:16:55,907
So, what was your high school
experience like?

00:16:55,907 --> 00:16:57,676
I was usually, uh,

00:16:57,676 --> 00:16:59,044
in the back of the van,

00:16:59,044 --> 00:17:01,079
sandwiched between
a guitar case and a hitchhiker.

00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:02,414
Oh, that's right.

00:17:02,414 --> 00:17:04,382
I'm sorry,
I forgot the, uh,

00:17:04,382 --> 00:17:06,384
traveling family caravan.

00:17:06,384 --> 00:17:08,086
Wasn't that bad.

00:17:08,086 --> 00:17:09,621
Depending on the hitchhiker.

00:17:12,557 --> 00:17:13,992
Little late
for a visit.

00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:15,861
Now, who's that?

00:17:15,861 --> 00:17:16,962
Zoom in.

00:17:19,531 --> 00:17:22,701
That's our victim,
Becca Sabin, two nights ago.

00:17:24,703 --> 00:17:25,804
Digging up dirt.

00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:31,576
Wait a minute, now, who's that?

00:17:33,778 --> 00:17:35,981
That's Grady Foster.

00:17:35,981 --> 00:17:37,115
Her better half.

00:17:43,822 --> 00:17:45,490
BRASS: You lied
to us, Mr. Foster.

00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:47,692
You said that Becca
never had access

00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:50,028
to your patients'
secrets.

00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:51,897
She did.

00:17:51,897 --> 00:17:54,799
And when she started spilling
those secrets at the reunion,

00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,601
jeopardizing your
whole practice,

00:17:56,601 --> 00:17:57,969
you shut her up.

00:17:57,969 --> 00:18:00,105
Of course I was mad
with her for snooping.

00:18:00,105 --> 00:18:01,606
I figured she was just curious.

00:18:01,606 --> 00:18:04,042
Secret lives of strangers.

00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:05,043
I didn't realize

00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:06,545
she knew any of my patients

00:18:06,545 --> 00:18:08,380
until I saw those patients
at the reunion.

00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,915
Well, that's convenient.

00:18:09,915 --> 00:18:11,950
Additional suspects
all mingling together

00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:13,685
makes it easier
to commit the crime.

00:18:16,555 --> 00:18:20,025
Do you not think I knew
the kind of woman I married?

00:18:20,025 --> 00:18:21,426
I had Becca pegged

00:18:21,426 --> 00:18:23,962
within five minutes
of meeting her.

00:18:23,962 --> 00:18:25,664
Narcissistic.

00:18:25,664 --> 00:18:27,699
Manipulative.

00:18:27,699 --> 00:18:30,635
With a near-pathological
hunger for gossip.

00:18:30,635 --> 00:18:32,871
And I loved her for all of it.

00:18:32,871 --> 00:18:35,340
I never laid
a hand on her.

00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:38,476
Now, unless you've got evidence

00:18:38,476 --> 00:18:41,079
of anything other than
a... a marital spat...

00:18:43,582 --> 00:18:47,052
...I believe this session's
time is up.

00:18:49,621 --> 00:18:51,590
(whirring, beeping)

00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,763
Is that the last
of the 99 red balloons?

00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:02,334
I've swabbed way more than
99 of these bastards.

00:19:02,334 --> 00:19:04,703
There's a few on that post
there behind you

00:19:04,703 --> 00:19:07,772
that I haven't
gotten to yet.

00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:10,575
Nick said that the therapist
office surveillance

00:19:10,575 --> 00:19:12,844
didn't turn up any alums
who were patients.

00:19:12,844 --> 00:19:14,746
I thought we'd already
spun the suspect bottle

00:19:14,746 --> 00:19:17,082
to Dr. Hubby himself.

00:19:17,082 --> 00:19:18,717
No physical evidence
against him.

00:19:21,753 --> 00:19:23,521
Did you go to your
high school reunion?

00:19:23,521 --> 00:19:25,824
Ten-year was
last year.

00:19:25,824 --> 00:19:28,960
Didn't make
the trip out.

00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,562
You?

00:19:30,562 --> 00:19:33,498
The one area of history
I choose not to dwell in?

00:19:33,498 --> 00:19:35,834
My high school years.

00:19:35,834 --> 00:19:38,036
But you...

00:19:38,036 --> 00:19:39,404
beautiful blonde,

00:19:39,404 --> 00:19:43,508
sunny SoCal--
you must have loved it.

00:19:43,508 --> 00:19:44,776
Yeah.

00:19:44,776 --> 00:19:46,578
Could've been worse.

00:19:52,684 --> 00:19:55,987
I've got some trace on this one.

00:19:55,987 --> 00:19:57,055
(cell phone beeps)

00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,890
Just got a text from Brass.

00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:01,059
Some kid tweeted LVPD,

00:20:01,059 --> 00:20:04,362
"You idiots missed a dead body
at Sagebrush High.

00:20:04,362 --> 00:20:05,563
50 yard line."

00:20:07,932 --> 00:20:09,868
♪ ♪

00:20:22,547 --> 00:20:23,748
Well, he's breathing.

00:20:28,586 --> 00:20:30,789
I think I found the culprit.

00:20:32,991 --> 00:20:35,093
Sir.

00:20:35,093 --> 00:20:37,696
(shouts)
Come on!

00:20:37,696 --> 00:20:39,397
(grunts)

00:20:39,397 --> 00:20:40,899
Come on!

00:20:40,899 --> 00:20:42,067
Gooch!

00:20:42,067 --> 00:20:44,369
They're running
the blitz.

00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:45,670
Block, damn it! Block!

00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:46,971
(growls):
Yeah!

00:20:46,971 --> 00:20:49,374
(groans)

00:20:49,374 --> 00:20:50,742
We need a first down.

00:20:50,742 --> 00:20:51,976
You need a time-out.

00:20:51,976 --> 00:20:52,977
Greg, we need backup.

00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:07,959
Super Dave.

00:21:07,959 --> 00:21:09,461
Hey, Nick.

00:21:09,461 --> 00:21:10,929
Um, Russell said that
I could check in.

00:21:10,929 --> 00:21:13,431
Um... I heard about
the new suspect.

00:21:13,431 --> 00:21:15,567
Yeah, Sean McHenry.
You know him?

00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:17,068
Yeah, I know Sean.

00:21:17,068 --> 00:21:18,770
Big man on campus.

00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:20,605
Quarterback.

00:21:20,605 --> 00:21:22,607
He dated Becca Sabin
all four years.

00:21:22,607 --> 00:21:24,442
Really?
Mm-hmm.

00:21:24,442 --> 00:21:25,977
Well, her bloody handprint

00:21:25,977 --> 00:21:28,780
ended up on his back
last night.

00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:29,781
Wow.

00:21:29,781 --> 00:21:30,782
Well...

00:21:30,782 --> 00:21:32,016
for what it's worth,

00:21:32,016 --> 00:21:34,119
he was a colossal jerk
in high school.

00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:35,120
Really?
Yeah.

00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,721
Hmm.

00:21:36,721 --> 00:21:37,889
Janet.

00:21:37,889 --> 00:21:38,957
What are you
doing here?

00:21:38,957 --> 00:21:41,593
I'm representing my client.

00:21:41,593 --> 00:21:43,595
I'm sorry, why would you
want to help him?

00:21:43,595 --> 00:21:44,896
Easy, Dave.

00:21:44,896 --> 00:21:46,364
Take it easy, buddy.

00:21:46,364 --> 00:21:48,666
He called me,
requested my counsel.

00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:50,401
If you've got some
post-wedgie grudge

00:21:50,401 --> 00:21:51,903
against the guy, grow up.

00:21:51,903 --> 00:21:53,071
High school's over, David.

00:21:59,377 --> 00:22:01,579
What do you do
for a living, Mr. McHenry?

00:22:01,579 --> 00:22:02,814
He's an educator.

00:22:02,814 --> 00:22:03,882
What capacity?

00:22:03,882 --> 00:22:05,016
A gym teacher.

00:22:05,016 --> 00:22:06,351
Gym teacher.

00:22:06,351 --> 00:22:09,087
Okay. What grade?

00:22:09,087 --> 00:22:10,088
Junior high.

00:22:10,088 --> 00:22:11,856
Junior high.

00:22:11,856 --> 00:22:14,392
Well, that's a tough age,
isn't it? (chuckles)

00:22:14,392 --> 00:22:15,627
Hey, speaking of,

00:22:15,627 --> 00:22:19,731
it must be hard
to have your best days

00:22:19,731 --> 00:22:21,466
15 years behind you, huh?

00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:23,902
(scoffs)
How's that?

00:22:23,902 --> 00:22:26,037
Wrangling dodge balls
for little kids?

00:22:26,037 --> 00:22:27,772
(chuckles)

00:22:27,772 --> 00:22:31,109
When all your classmates have
passed you by, forgotten you.

00:22:31,109 --> 00:22:32,677
Well, like with Becca,

00:22:32,677 --> 00:22:34,746
she married
a much more successful man.

00:22:34,746 --> 00:22:36,648
(scoffs)
Becca was still into me.

00:22:36,648 --> 00:22:38,349
Sean...
She was.

00:22:38,349 --> 00:22:39,784
She was all over me.

00:22:39,784 --> 00:22:41,386
At the reunion?
Yeah.

00:22:41,386 --> 00:22:44,022
She took me back
into that storeroom.

00:22:44,022 --> 00:22:45,690
We were making out
like we were 16.

00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:47,358
Or...

00:22:47,358 --> 00:22:51,629
maybe you wanted it to be...
like you were 16 again.

00:22:51,629 --> 00:22:53,097
Huh? You followed her
back there,

00:22:53,097 --> 00:22:55,500
she shut you down,
you grabbed the knife...

00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,635
No.
What about the blood
on your back?

00:22:57,635 --> 00:22:59,404
She had a little cut
on her palm.

00:22:59,404 --> 00:23:00,839
That's probably
how the blood got there.

00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:05,376
She was into me. She was.

00:23:05,376 --> 00:23:06,778
Come on.

00:23:06,778 --> 00:23:08,513
Sean, really?

00:23:08,513 --> 00:23:09,948
She was.

00:23:13,084 --> 00:23:14,953
For a minute,
and then she backed off,

00:23:14,953 --> 00:23:16,721
said she had to get back
to the party.

00:23:18,756 --> 00:23:20,491
And you just
let her go?
Yeah.

00:23:20,491 --> 00:23:22,927
I'd had enough
of the reunion.
Okay.

00:23:22,927 --> 00:23:23,828
Then what?

00:23:25,864 --> 00:23:28,433
Then I went
to the closest liquor store.

00:23:28,433 --> 00:23:30,501
Took the bottle out
under the Friday night lights

00:23:30,501 --> 00:23:32,537
to drink alone.

00:23:34,439 --> 00:23:35,640
'Cause you're right.

00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,842
Those were the best days
of my life.

00:23:40,511 --> 00:23:41,646
Can this be over?

00:23:41,646 --> 00:23:42,747
It can.

00:23:42,747 --> 00:23:44,515
You're not holding my client?

00:23:44,515 --> 00:23:47,652
No. No, no.

00:23:47,652 --> 00:23:49,587
Don't go far, Sean.

00:23:49,587 --> 00:23:51,589
(chuckles)

00:23:51,589 --> 00:23:53,825
Never have.

00:23:53,825 --> 00:23:58,463
Trace from your burst bubble is
asbestos and acrylic tan paint.

00:23:58,463 --> 00:23:59,864
Piece of popcorn ceiling.

00:23:59,864 --> 00:24:02,066
Mm-hmm. As you no doubt
remember witnessing

00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:06,704
at the temple to 1974
that is my mother's home.

00:24:06,704 --> 00:24:08,373
Note the addition
of a second

00:24:08,373 --> 00:24:11,009
gray-colored paint
on said ceiling-kernel.

00:24:18,483 --> 00:24:20,485
Ceiling in the cafeteria
is white.

00:24:21,552 --> 00:24:23,688
Ceiling in the storeroom is tan.

00:24:26,457 --> 00:24:27,659
Take a look at this.

00:24:29,727 --> 00:24:33,965
Ceiling access
panel--gray paint.

00:24:33,965 --> 00:24:35,366
Right above the bubble tray.

00:24:35,366 --> 00:24:36,668
BRODY:
<i>Someone opened it.</i>

00:25:12,103 --> 00:25:13,504
(gasps)

00:25:22,847 --> 00:25:26,718
Are those guys gonna blow up
all of our evidence?
Not all of it.

00:25:26,718 --> 00:25:29,120
Whoa!

00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,723
Bomb squad managed to
separate the non-explosive

00:25:31,723 --> 00:25:34,659
parts from the bomb,
served it up for us to analyze.

00:25:34,659 --> 00:25:37,462
And I got the ceiling
panel over there, too.

00:25:37,462 --> 00:25:39,397
Morgan said that they were
basic pipe bombs.

00:25:39,397 --> 00:25:40,631
Yeah.

00:25:40,631 --> 00:25:42,433
The pipe end caps
were loosely sealed,

00:25:42,433 --> 00:25:44,635
so the detonation would have
been all flare, no bang.

00:25:44,635 --> 00:25:46,104
Yeah, well,
bomber didn't know that.

00:25:46,104 --> 00:25:48,473
Mm.
Okay, so here's a new theory.

00:25:48,473 --> 00:25:50,742
<i>Bomber sneaks</i>
<i>into the storeroom...</i>

00:25:50,742 --> 00:25:53,644
SANDERS: <i>Becca picks the wrong</i>
<i>time to refill the bubble tray.</i>

00:25:53,644 --> 00:25:55,546
Unplanned stabbing.

00:25:55,546 --> 00:25:57,815
Killer flees without
detonating the bomb.

00:25:57,815 --> 00:26:00,952
So, Sean McHenry is
still our prime suspect.

00:26:00,952 --> 00:26:03,755
Yeah, Becca's bloody handprint's
on his shirt.

00:26:03,755 --> 00:26:05,556
All right,
what do we have here?

00:26:05,556 --> 00:26:06,958
Uh, ignition device.

00:26:06,958 --> 00:26:09,360
Some consumer electronics item.

00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,497
I guess Hodges can dig
into that.
Yeah.

00:26:12,497 --> 00:26:16,934
Duct tape that wrapped the bomb
and attached these to it.

00:26:16,934 --> 00:26:18,736
Looks like plaster.

00:26:18,736 --> 00:26:21,339
Too fragile to be shrapnel.

00:26:21,339 --> 00:26:23,908
Maybe a form
of the bomber's signature?

00:26:23,908 --> 00:26:28,646
These pieces fit together.

00:26:28,646 --> 00:26:29,947
I'll work on this puzzle.

00:26:31,749 --> 00:26:33,384
So, I've been looking

00:26:33,384 --> 00:26:36,120
through Sean McHenry's Internet
and e-mail history

00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,122
for any research
he might have been doing,

00:26:38,122 --> 00:26:39,924
and bomb-making came up empty.

00:26:39,924 --> 00:26:42,493
But I might have found out
why he planted it.

00:26:42,493 --> 00:26:43,461
Why is that?

00:26:43,461 --> 00:26:44,729
Well, he got pink-slipped

00:26:44,729 --> 00:26:47,632
from his gym-teaching job
last week.

00:26:47,632 --> 00:26:50,401
That's a bit of a leap
to bombing a reunion, isn't it?

00:26:50,401 --> 00:26:52,703
It really had nothing
to do with the reunion.

00:26:52,703 --> 00:26:54,705
The school board just voted

00:26:54,705 --> 00:26:58,709
to eliminate gym class
from the district junior highs.

00:26:58,709 --> 00:27:00,511
Sean got all
bent out of shape,

00:27:00,511 --> 00:27:03,014
demanding that they rethink
their decision.

00:27:03,014 --> 00:27:05,516
Of course they didn't,
he's out of a job.

00:27:05,516 --> 00:27:06,984
Now,

00:27:06,984 --> 00:27:08,453
where do you think

00:27:08,453 --> 00:27:10,054
the school board
is gonna meet next?

00:27:12,023 --> 00:27:14,892
Sagebrush High,
school cafeteria.

00:27:14,892 --> 00:27:16,861
And the entire school board
is gonna be sitting

00:27:16,861 --> 00:27:19,730
along that very same wall
where we found that bomb.

00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:22,033
So the reunion was not
the bomb's target.

00:27:22,033 --> 00:27:23,668
It was the opportunity
to plant it.

00:27:23,668 --> 00:27:25,470
I'll call Brass.

00:27:30,808 --> 00:27:32,376
Russell.
Yeah?

00:27:32,376 --> 00:27:34,011
Just hit the liquor store
near the high school

00:27:34,011 --> 00:27:35,513
to check out
Sean McHenry's story.

00:27:35,513 --> 00:27:37,048
Store clerk has him on camera

00:27:37,048 --> 00:27:39,350
buying whiskey within an hour
of Becca's death.

00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:41,452
That much we already know
from Sean, though, don't we?

00:27:41,452 --> 00:27:44,422
But big man on campus
left out one big thing.

00:27:44,422 --> 00:27:45,556
A bright yellow Dumpster

00:27:45,556 --> 00:27:47,458
on the edge of
the store lot.

00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:49,961
It was begging to be searched.

00:27:49,961 --> 00:27:51,462
And I found this.

00:27:56,367 --> 00:27:59,370
Sean bought whiskey,
but he also dumped the weapon.

00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:01,372
Print this
and get it over to Henry.

00:28:01,372 --> 00:28:03,541
Let's get a profile
on the blood.

00:28:03,541 --> 00:28:04,575
Nice work.

00:28:09,347 --> 00:28:11,015
Sean McHenry, LVPD!

00:28:12,483 --> 00:28:13,618
Get your hands up.

00:28:13,618 --> 00:28:14,719
SEAN:
What the hell is this?

00:28:14,719 --> 00:28:17,121
You're under arrest.

00:28:17,121 --> 00:28:18,656
You too. Out.

00:28:20,892 --> 00:28:23,794
Counseling your client,
I see.

00:28:23,794 --> 00:28:26,330
You red-staters still familiar
with the notion of warrants?

00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:28,499
Yes.
I have two.

00:28:28,499 --> 00:28:30,701
One to arrest Sean
for the murder

00:28:30,701 --> 00:28:33,371
of Becca Sabin,
and the other one

00:28:33,371 --> 00:28:35,740
gives me the right
to search for explosives.

00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:36,741
What?

00:28:36,741 --> 00:28:37,808
I don't understand.

00:28:37,808 --> 00:28:39,343
You didn't tell your girlfriend

00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:40,912
about the bomb
you planted at the school?

00:28:40,912 --> 00:28:42,446
What are you
talking about?

00:28:42,446 --> 00:28:43,948
Your vendetta
against the school board,

00:28:43,948 --> 00:28:46,017
how you were planning
to blow them all away.

00:28:46,017 --> 00:28:48,386
You mean, telling them that
gym class is the only thing

00:28:48,386 --> 00:28:49,887
keeping some of
these kids sane?

00:28:49,887 --> 00:28:51,622
You think
I'd hurt people over that?

00:28:51,622 --> 00:28:52,957
Get him out of here.

00:28:52,957 --> 00:28:54,559
Well...

00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:56,527
Can I at least
put some clothes on?

00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:00,998
What you got?

00:29:00,998 --> 00:29:03,467
I ran DNA on the blood
from the knife.

00:29:03,467 --> 00:29:04,936
It is Becca Sabin's blood.

00:29:04,936 --> 00:29:05,937
But?

00:29:05,937 --> 00:29:07,505
There was something odd.

00:29:07,505 --> 00:29:10,541
<i>The blood was completely</i>
<i>dried out.</i>

00:29:10,541 --> 00:29:12,043
<i>Dehydrated.</i>

00:29:12,043 --> 00:29:14,345
<i>I had to soak the sample</i>
<i>for 20 minutes</i>

00:29:14,345 --> 00:29:15,746
<i>before it would dissolve.</i>

00:29:15,746 --> 00:29:17,582
<i>It was a little frustrating,</i>

00:29:17,582 --> 00:29:20,585
<i>but finally I had something</i>
<i>I could work with.</i>

00:29:20,585 --> 00:29:22,987
What would cause that
level of dehydration?

00:29:22,987 --> 00:29:25,590
Normally? Long-term aging
of the blood

00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:27,658
or exposure
to extreme temperatures.

00:29:27,658 --> 00:29:30,094
None of which goes
along with our story.

00:29:30,094 --> 00:29:34,365
Guy plants a bomb, stabs
a girl, tosses the knife.

00:29:34,365 --> 00:29:35,833
Which means
there's more to the story.

00:29:35,833 --> 00:29:37,401
(chuckles)
Thanks.

00:29:37,401 --> 00:29:38,803
Yup.

00:29:38,803 --> 00:29:40,571
♪ ♪

00:29:49,847 --> 00:29:52,450
(trilling)

00:30:11,402 --> 00:30:12,503
SANDERS:
<i>This plaster mask</i>

00:30:12,503 --> 00:30:14,505
was attached
to the bomb.

00:30:14,505 --> 00:30:17,041
Whoever this
girl is...

00:30:17,041 --> 00:30:19,010
...she means something
to the bomber.

00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:20,645
I thought you might
recognize her.

00:30:23,014 --> 00:30:24,515
Her name's Caroline.

00:30:24,515 --> 00:30:25,516
You know her?

00:30:25,516 --> 00:30:27,518
I did.

00:30:27,518 --> 00:30:28,853
Till she killed herself.

00:30:35,092 --> 00:30:37,995
PHILLIPS: Caroline Hartwell
was a fellow misfit.

00:30:37,995 --> 00:30:39,830
Two years behind me.

00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:42,967
I used to see her in the library
reading all the Ray Bradbury.

00:30:42,967 --> 00:30:44,435
I liked Ray Bradbury.

00:30:46,671 --> 00:30:47,738
Some of the seniors--

00:30:47,738 --> 00:30:51,442
Sean McHenry, Becca Sabin--

00:30:51,442 --> 00:30:53,344
they used to
make fun of her.

00:30:53,344 --> 00:30:56,580
The way she dressed,
the scar on her lip.

00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:57,948
Spring of '98,

00:30:57,948 --> 00:31:01,686
she was a sophomore,
and she hung herself.

00:31:04,388 --> 00:31:05,823
Tell me about this.

00:31:05,823 --> 00:31:08,726
Art students would make
these masks of themselves.

00:31:08,726 --> 00:31:10,928
Then they'd put them up on the
wall until the end of the year.

00:31:10,928 --> 00:31:13,431
So anyone could have taken
Caroline's mask, right,

00:31:13,431 --> 00:31:15,633
and kept it until now,
and then used it in the bomb?

00:31:15,633 --> 00:31:17,101
Revenge on her behalf.

00:31:17,101 --> 00:31:18,903
Maybe.

00:31:18,903 --> 00:31:22,540
Guys, I got a print off
the bomb's duct tape.

00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:25,476
AFIS match
to a work card.

00:31:25,476 --> 00:31:27,578
Man named
Max Dinello.

00:31:28,779 --> 00:31:30,014
Also, I found

00:31:30,014 --> 00:31:31,949
a partial print
from him on the inside

00:31:31,949 --> 00:31:34,552
of the ceiling panel.

00:31:34,552 --> 00:31:36,487
Oh, here he is.

00:31:36,487 --> 00:31:37,555
Class of '98.

00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:41,625
He was friends with Caroline.

00:31:41,625 --> 00:31:43,494
There's no Max Dinello
on the list

00:31:43,494 --> 00:31:45,830
of people processed
at the reunion.

00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:48,466
PHILLIPS:
Cut the hair, add a few years...

00:31:48,466 --> 00:31:49,967
Hey.

00:31:49,967 --> 00:31:50,968
Hey.

00:31:50,968 --> 00:31:52,636
I spoke to him.

00:31:52,636 --> 00:31:54,605
He must have snuck out
before the police arrived.

00:31:54,605 --> 00:31:55,840
I'll call Brass.

00:31:59,577 --> 00:32:01,011
Look, planting the bomb

00:32:01,011 --> 00:32:03,748
and stabbing Becca have
to be related, right?

00:32:03,748 --> 00:32:05,049
Yeah, I think so.

00:32:05,049 --> 00:32:07,118
Timeline's too tight
to be a coincidence.

00:32:07,118 --> 00:32:09,687
Yeah, but it
doesn't make sense.

00:32:09,687 --> 00:32:13,724
If Max Dinello's the bomber
and the stabber,

00:32:13,724 --> 00:32:16,026
then how did the knife end up
at the liquor store

00:32:16,026 --> 00:32:17,628
that Sean McHenry went to?

00:32:17,628 --> 00:32:19,497
Max could have
planted it, right?

00:32:19,497 --> 00:32:21,365
I mean,
if what he was after

00:32:21,365 --> 00:32:24,869
was revenge for Caroline, then
framing one of her tormentors

00:32:24,869 --> 00:32:26,771
accomplishes the same thing.

00:32:26,771 --> 00:32:31,542
But how did Max know that
Sean went to that liquor store?

00:32:31,542 --> 00:32:32,643
Hey, guys.

00:32:32,643 --> 00:32:33,744
I was looking up

00:32:33,744 --> 00:32:35,479
background on Max Dinello.

00:32:35,479 --> 00:32:36,947
He is a teacher
at an alternative school

00:32:36,947 --> 00:32:38,649
for troubled teens.

00:32:38,649 --> 00:32:40,451
And I was checking out
the school's Web site.

00:32:40,451 --> 00:32:43,387
I came across this photo.

00:32:43,387 --> 00:32:45,389
That's Sean's attorney,
Janet Morris.

00:32:45,389 --> 00:32:46,590
SANDERS:
Yeah, only she's not

00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:47,591
an attorney anymore.

00:32:47,591 --> 00:32:48,793
She's a lunch lady.

00:32:48,793 --> 00:32:49,860
You kidding me?

00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,495
SANDERS:
The school confirmed it.

00:32:51,495 --> 00:32:53,397
She lives at home
with her parents in Henderson.

00:32:53,397 --> 00:32:54,999
Unis are on their way
to pick her up now.

00:32:54,999 --> 00:32:57,001
So Max and Janet
are working together?

00:32:57,001 --> 00:32:58,569
The vengeful outcast

00:32:58,569 --> 00:33:01,005
and the tarnished golden girl
joining forces?

00:33:01,005 --> 00:33:02,406
RUSSELL:
Max plants the bomb,

00:33:02,406 --> 00:33:04,809
stabs Becca
when she catches him.

00:33:04,809 --> 00:33:08,779
Janet plants the knife and then
frames Sean for the crime.

00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:10,481
(phone chimes)

00:33:10,481 --> 00:33:11,982
Gets to play big-shot attorney.

00:33:11,982 --> 00:33:14,084
Max Dinello's not home.

00:33:14,084 --> 00:33:16,954
Brass has put a broadcast out
on his car.

00:33:19,523 --> 00:33:20,958
You have a minute?

00:33:20,958 --> 00:33:24,528
I was looking for Henry,
but he's not around.

00:33:24,528 --> 00:33:25,863
You want to talk?

00:33:25,863 --> 00:33:28,666
About how you let
the killer flee?

00:33:28,666 --> 00:33:30,501
Good one.
I'm gonna look for Henry.

00:33:30,501 --> 00:33:32,770
David. David.
Come on.

00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:34,905
I'm kidding. Come in.

00:33:34,905 --> 00:33:37,908
Grab a lab coat.

00:33:37,908 --> 00:33:39,844
You know, even in high
school, I knew that

00:33:39,844 --> 00:33:42,446
these were much cooler than
any stupid letterman's jacket.

00:33:42,446 --> 00:33:44,882
Attracts a finer
breed of woman, too.

00:33:44,882 --> 00:33:46,784
Well, you can't argue
with Elisabetta.

00:33:46,784 --> 00:33:48,919
Only because she can't conjugate
when she's angry.

00:33:48,919 --> 00:33:49,954
(chuckles)

00:33:49,954 --> 00:33:51,522
So, uh...

00:33:51,522 --> 00:33:53,090
what's got you down?
Just wish I had

00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:56,327
more answers, instead of feeling
like that lost kid again.

00:33:56,327 --> 00:34:00,865
Even on a normal case, we're not
working crossword puzzles here.

00:34:00,865 --> 00:34:02,500
It can get tough.

00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:07,471
And, whether you like it or not,
you are involved.

00:34:07,471 --> 00:34:09,707
It does help to have
a gorgeous Mediterranean goddess

00:34:09,707 --> 00:34:11,609
waiting for you at home,
if you can arrange that.

00:34:11,609 --> 00:34:13,344
(chuckles)
Although...

00:34:13,344 --> 00:34:15,813
I have to say, you're doing
quite well for yourself.

00:34:18,983 --> 00:34:20,117
Hmm.

00:34:20,117 --> 00:34:22,019
Something bothering you?

00:34:22,019 --> 00:34:24,555
HODGES:
The evidence.

00:34:24,555 --> 00:34:27,458
I'm thinking this bomb
is a blast from the past.

00:34:27,458 --> 00:34:28,626
What do you mean?

00:34:28,626 --> 00:34:30,661
Start with...
duct tape's old.

00:34:30,661 --> 00:34:32,396
The logo on the end
of it was used

00:34:32,396 --> 00:34:34,398
by the company from '93 to 2000.

00:34:34,398 --> 00:34:35,900
The ignition components

00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:40,571
are from a walkie-talkie
that was manufactured in 1998.

00:34:40,571 --> 00:34:41,872
And the batteries
that were in it

00:34:41,872 --> 00:34:43,774
have a "use by" date

00:34:43,774 --> 00:34:46,076
that puts their sale
at spring '98.

00:34:46,076 --> 00:34:49,580
So what are you saying?
I'm saying

00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:52,049
I don't think that this bomb
was placed at the reunion

00:34:52,049 --> 00:34:54,752
for something that happened
in 1998.

00:34:54,752 --> 00:34:57,021
I think it was placed there
<i>in</i> 1998.

00:34:57,021 --> 00:34:59,023
But we know that the ceiling
panel was accessed

00:34:59,023 --> 00:35:00,090
during the reunion.

00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:02,393
Right. By your pal Max Dinello.

00:35:02,393 --> 00:35:03,594
So what was he doing?

00:35:03,594 --> 00:35:06,330
Like, adjusting something
on the bomb?

00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:09,533
Or...defusing it.

00:35:09,533 --> 00:35:11,902
When I was lifting
prints off of the tape,

00:35:11,902 --> 00:35:13,537
I noticed these spots.

00:35:13,537 --> 00:35:15,506
As if something dripped on it,

00:35:15,506 --> 00:35:17,775
sapping all the moisture
from the adhesive.

00:35:17,775 --> 00:35:20,411
What could do that?

00:35:20,411 --> 00:35:21,612
This.

00:35:25,082 --> 00:35:26,483
Liquid nitrogen.

00:35:26,483 --> 00:35:29,520
Sometimes used
in defusing bombs.

00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,022
Poured over the components,
it temporarily freezes them

00:35:32,022 --> 00:35:34,091
so that the bomb
can be removed safely.

00:35:34,091 --> 00:35:36,360
I'm almost positive
that some liquid nitrogen

00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,828
got splashed onto this bomb.

00:35:37,828 --> 00:35:40,731
Henry did say that the blood
he found on the knife

00:35:40,731 --> 00:35:43,867
was dehydrated, like it had been
exposed to extreme temperatures.

00:35:47,404 --> 00:35:48,539
Thanks.

00:35:56,347 --> 00:35:59,617
Tissue, tissue. Throat, lip.

00:36:12,396 --> 00:36:14,765
The sample from Becca's lip
doesn't exhibit

00:36:14,765 --> 00:36:18,035
the intranuclear inclusions
of a viral sore.

00:36:18,035 --> 00:36:20,638
Instead, the cells have

00:36:20,638 --> 00:36:22,106
irregular vacuoles

00:36:22,106 --> 00:36:24,441
and darker
nuclear chromatin.

00:36:24,441 --> 00:36:26,977
Qualities caused
by the flash-freezing of tissue.

00:36:26,977 --> 00:36:29,780
As you'd expect from
contact with liquid nitrogen.

00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:31,849
Now, ingesting liquid nitrogen

00:36:31,849 --> 00:36:34,118
<i>could have caused</i>
<i>the swollen epiglottis,</i>

00:36:34,118 --> 00:36:37,655
<i>the irritation that I had</i>
<i>attributed to the acid reflux</i>

00:36:37,655 --> 00:36:39,523
<i>and the injury to the stomach</i>

00:36:39,523 --> 00:36:41,859
<i>that I had previously deemed</i>
<i>an ulcer.</i>

00:36:41,859 --> 00:36:43,627
They were caused
by one event.

00:36:43,627 --> 00:36:45,496
Ingesting liquid nitrogen.

00:36:45,496 --> 00:36:48,032
Exactly.

00:36:48,032 --> 00:36:49,566
That's very impressive,
you guys.

00:36:49,566 --> 00:36:50,934
Hey, not me.

00:36:50,934 --> 00:36:52,569
All David.

00:37:02,413 --> 00:37:03,781
Mr. Dinello.

00:37:06,016 --> 00:37:07,651
Look,

00:37:07,651 --> 00:37:11,355
I teach my students
to own up to their crimes.

00:37:11,355 --> 00:37:13,090
I failed to do that.

00:37:14,792 --> 00:37:15,926
But I'll do it now.

00:37:17,561 --> 00:37:20,497
You don't have
to waste your time.

00:37:20,497 --> 00:37:21,999
I killed Becca Sabin.

00:37:24,435 --> 00:37:26,336
Okay. Um, speaking of time,

00:37:26,336 --> 00:37:29,540
l-let's, um...
let's back up 15 years.

00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:31,642
You placed a bomb

00:37:31,642 --> 00:37:34,912
in the ceiling above the spot
where Becca and Sean

00:37:34,912 --> 00:37:37,014
and the other cool kids
had lunch every day, right?

00:37:37,014 --> 00:37:40,384
You wanted vengeance
for Caroline Hartwell,

00:37:40,384 --> 00:37:43,420
for what those kids
made her do to herself.

00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:47,524
But you never set
that bomb off back then.

00:37:47,524 --> 00:37:48,492
Why?

00:37:49,727 --> 00:37:51,695
A teacher.

00:37:51,695 --> 00:37:53,764
Mr. Miller.

00:37:53,764 --> 00:37:54,898
Math.

00:37:54,898 --> 00:37:56,700
He was one of
the good ones.

00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:59,703
He saw some of the things
that I had...

00:37:59,703 --> 00:38:02,973
(sighs)
scrawled in my notebooks, and...

00:38:02,973 --> 00:38:05,075
I told him to leave me alone.

00:38:05,075 --> 00:38:08,979
He told me enough people
had done that already.

00:38:08,979 --> 00:38:10,848
He didn't know
about the bomb

00:38:10,848 --> 00:38:12,983
or what I was up to,

00:38:12,983 --> 00:38:15,052
but...

00:38:15,052 --> 00:38:19,857
he said whatever it was,
it wasn't worth it.

00:38:19,857 --> 00:38:23,494
So, 15 years,
you become a teacher yourself,

00:38:23,494 --> 00:38:25,863
helping kids going
through the same stuff.

00:38:25,863 --> 00:38:29,399
But that bomb--still there.

00:38:29,399 --> 00:38:30,734
Every day.

00:38:30,734 --> 00:38:33,504
Surrounded by innocent kids.

00:38:33,504 --> 00:38:36,440
I was pretty sure that it
wouldn't go off accidentally.

00:38:37,708 --> 00:38:39,777
I told myself that. For years.

00:38:39,777 --> 00:38:41,845
But there was
always a chance.

00:38:41,845 --> 00:38:44,581
And if that bomb did go off,
hurt somebody...

00:38:44,581 --> 00:38:46,984
Then everything
that I had done to change,

00:38:46,984 --> 00:38:49,753
to help my students change,
it all would've been wiped out.

00:38:49,753 --> 00:38:52,956
So the reunion was a chance
for you to sneak back in

00:38:52,956 --> 00:38:54,558
and make sure
that didn't happen.

00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:01,732
What are you doing?

00:39:04,434 --> 00:39:06,003
(coughing)

00:39:06,003 --> 00:39:07,037
Why didn't you just

00:39:07,037 --> 00:39:08,972
report the bomb to the police?

00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:12,509
With everything that's been
in the news, I couldn't bear

00:39:12,509 --> 00:39:15,479
the kids at that school,
teachers like Mr. Miller,

00:39:15,479 --> 00:39:17,514
hearing that the same thing
had almost happened

00:39:17,514 --> 00:39:19,683
at Sagebrush High, too.

00:39:19,683 --> 00:39:23,654
So, how does that lead
to a stabbing?

00:39:23,654 --> 00:39:26,890
MAX: <i>The liquid nitrogen</i>
<i>was choking her.</i>

00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:28,725
<i>There was no time.</i>
<i>I had to do something.</i>

00:39:28,725 --> 00:39:31,461
(choking)

00:39:31,461 --> 00:39:33,764
Shh, shh! Relax,
relax, relax.

00:39:33,764 --> 00:39:36,333
An emergency tracheotomy.

00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:38,101
She was struggling.
Fighting him, so...

00:39:38,101 --> 00:39:40,871
<i>it didn't work.</i>

00:39:40,871 --> 00:39:42,439
MAX:
<i>She wouldn't hold still.</i>

00:39:42,439 --> 00:39:44,441
<i>She was terrified of me.</i>

00:39:49,813 --> 00:39:51,849
And then she was gone.

00:39:51,849 --> 00:39:54,017
Max wanted to turn himself in.

00:39:54,017 --> 00:39:55,018
I told him not to.

00:39:55,018 --> 00:39:56,019
He was just

00:39:56,019 --> 00:39:57,754
trying to do good.

00:39:57,754 --> 00:40:00,891
He didn't deserve
to have his life ruined.

00:40:00,891 --> 00:40:02,759
I put the knife in
the nitrogen tank.

00:40:02,759 --> 00:40:04,895
I told him to get out of there.
I'd get rid of the evidence.

00:40:04,895 --> 00:40:08,699
So Max didn't deserve
to have his life ruined?

00:40:08,699 --> 00:40:10,934
But Sean McHenry, he did?

00:40:10,934 --> 00:40:13,670
You knew about the liquor store
and planted the knife there.

00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:15,072
You framed him.

00:40:15,072 --> 00:40:17,341
You got to act out
your lawyer fantasy.

00:40:17,341 --> 00:40:21,011
You got to sleep with
the class stud as a nice perk.

00:40:21,011 --> 00:40:24,081
You didn't lie about Harvard.

00:40:24,081 --> 00:40:25,582
How does somebody

00:40:25,582 --> 00:40:30,654
at the top of their class
end up here?

00:40:30,654 --> 00:40:34,057
I couldn't wait to get out
of high school.

00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:36,760
Into the real world.

00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,396
I busted my ass.

00:40:39,396 --> 00:40:40,931
Undergrad, law school.

00:40:40,931 --> 00:40:43,400
100-hour weeks as a grunt

00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,736
at a New York firm.

00:40:45,736 --> 00:40:49,473
But nothing changed.

00:40:49,473 --> 00:40:52,709
Pretty got promoted,
gossip counted

00:40:52,709 --> 00:40:54,044
more than achievement,

00:40:54,044 --> 00:40:56,580
and one day I just broke down
because...

00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,448
High school never ended.

00:41:05,455 --> 00:41:07,024
So what'll happen to them?

00:41:07,024 --> 00:41:08,525
Max and Janet?

00:41:08,525 --> 00:41:10,494
Doesn't look good.

00:41:10,494 --> 00:41:13,597
Obstruction, accessory,

00:41:13,597 --> 00:41:15,933
maybe even manslaughter.

00:41:15,933 --> 00:41:18,468
You what I think
their real crime was?

00:41:18,468 --> 00:41:21,672
Getting lost
in their pasts.

00:41:21,672 --> 00:41:24,508
Janet trying to live up
to old ambitions.

00:41:24,508 --> 00:41:25,609
Mm-hmm.

00:41:25,609 --> 00:41:29,579
Max trying to undo
an old mistake.

00:41:29,579 --> 00:41:31,949
I was one of those freaks
who liked high school.

00:41:31,949 --> 00:41:33,483
Come on.

00:41:33,483 --> 00:41:35,085
I mean, there are plenty
of other contenders

00:41:35,085 --> 00:41:36,853
for the worst
years of my life.
(chuckles)

00:41:36,853 --> 00:41:39,823
But what do you get
for dwelling on them?

00:41:39,823 --> 00:41:43,393
Anxiety, uh, self-loathing

00:41:43,393 --> 00:41:45,062
and high blood pressure.

00:41:45,062 --> 00:41:49,599
You know, I think at some point
you just have to move forward.

00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:50,634
(cell phone chiming)

00:41:50,634 --> 00:41:51,635
Excuse me.

00:41:54,838 --> 00:41:55,806
Hi, honey.

00:41:57,975 --> 00:41:59,576
How long between contractions?

00:42:02,913 --> 00:42:04,848
(chuckles)

00:42:13,123 --> 00:42:15,092
Guys.

00:42:15,092 --> 00:42:16,126
Come on in.

00:42:16,126 --> 00:42:17,928
(chuckles)

00:42:22,833 --> 00:42:25,569
(chuckles)

00:42:25,569 --> 00:42:28,905
Guys, Joshua Adam Phillips.

00:42:31,875 --> 00:42:33,643
Doc,

00:42:33,643 --> 00:42:35,445
you're first.
(whispers):
I'd be honored.

00:42:35,445 --> 00:42:38,882
Hey, young man. Yes.

00:42:38,882 --> 00:42:40,517
Amy, he's perfect.

00:42:40,517 --> 00:42:41,985
Thank you.
(chuckles)

00:42:44,421 --> 00:42:46,823
I am utterly envious.

00:42:50,027 --> 00:42:52,362
You're a lucky guy.

00:42:52,362 --> 00:42:53,563
I am.
