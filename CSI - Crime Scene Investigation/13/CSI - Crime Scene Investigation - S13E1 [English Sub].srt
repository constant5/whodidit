00:00:01,962 --> 00:00:04,965
(water splashing)

00:00:08,936 --> 00:00:10,404
(knocking on door)

00:00:10,404 --> 00:00:13,207
I'm gonna be out in a second.

00:00:17,178 --> 00:00:18,445
(phone rings)

00:00:18,445 --> 00:00:20,014
Is that a girlfriend?
Not right now.

00:00:20,014 --> 00:00:21,215
Can I see?

00:00:21,215 --> 00:00:22,416
Ah! Whoa!

00:00:22,416 --> 00:00:23,818
She wouldn't like that.

00:00:23,818 --> 00:00:25,386
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

00:00:27,121 --> 00:00:29,023
Gonna be here when I get back?

00:00:29,023 --> 00:00:30,825
If you're lucky.

00:00:33,828 --> 00:00:36,030
(phone chirps)

00:00:42,169 --> 00:00:43,771
RUSSELL:
Yeah.
Yeah, it's me.

00:00:43,771 --> 00:00:45,372
I just heard about Ecklie.
I'm at, uh...

00:00:45,372 --> 00:00:46,807
Where am I? I'm at, uh...

00:00:46,807 --> 00:00:48,809
Bar 483.

00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:50,277
I'm with
Moreno's partner Crenshaw.

00:00:50,277 --> 00:00:52,179
Jules...
Something's definitely
not right.

00:00:52,179 --> 00:00:53,447
they got Katie.
FINLAY:
What?!

00:00:53,447 --> 00:00:55,449
McKeen. His-his people,

00:00:55,449 --> 00:00:58,185
they took Katie for payback
for his son or something.

00:00:58,185 --> 00:00:59,887
Crenshaw's one of 'em.

00:00:59,887 --> 00:01:01,455
How do you know that?
FINLAY:
I just know.

00:01:01,455 --> 00:01:03,457
I'm gonna stick with him
and see where he takes me.

00:01:03,457 --> 00:01:05,159
You get your ass out of there
and come back

00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:06,360
right now--
I've lost enough tonight.

00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,730
I'll be in touch.

00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:12,132
BARBARA: Your father
will not let anything
happen to Kaitlyn.

00:01:12,132 --> 00:01:13,734
MAYA (sobbing):
No, no, no, no...

00:01:13,734 --> 00:01:15,369
I want to see her room!
You can't come in here.

00:01:15,369 --> 00:01:17,171
Listen, we have
to process the scene.

00:01:17,171 --> 00:01:18,405
The scene?!
What are you talk...

00:01:18,405 --> 00:01:19,807
Listen to me,
will you, please?

00:01:19,807 --> 00:01:21,008
Listen to me.

00:01:21,008 --> 00:01:22,776
I promise you
I will bring her home.

00:01:22,776 --> 00:01:23,978
I promise.

00:01:23,978 --> 00:01:25,312
(Maya sobbing)

00:01:25,312 --> 00:01:26,714
OFFICER (over radio):
Go with the vitals

00:01:26,714 --> 00:01:27,915
on Undersheriff Ecklie.

00:01:27,915 --> 00:01:29,149
Tachycardia
in the 120.

00:01:29,149 --> 00:01:31,719
BP: 82/40 and dropping.
O2 sats

00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:34,154
in the 80s with
assisted ventilation.
Preparing to transport.

00:01:34,154 --> 00:01:36,223
One, two, three.

00:01:36,223 --> 00:01:37,925
What's his condition?

00:01:37,925 --> 00:01:39,927
Stable but critical.

00:01:40,928 --> 00:01:42,863
I'm going with him.

00:01:47,935 --> 00:01:49,770
Russell's granddaughter's
been kidnapped.

00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,772
What?!
It sounds like
it's McKeen.

00:01:51,772 --> 00:01:53,173
Uh, I've tried
Nick three times.

00:01:53,173 --> 00:01:55,142
He's not picking up.

00:01:55,142 --> 00:01:57,411
Okay, I'll...
I'll handle things here.

00:01:57,411 --> 00:01:59,046
You should go to Russell's.

00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,283
Be careful.

00:02:09,924 --> 00:02:11,725
CRENSHAW:
Where's your car?

00:02:11,725 --> 00:02:13,427
(laughing):
I can't drive.

00:02:13,427 --> 00:02:15,296
We'll take mine.

00:02:17,665 --> 00:02:18,866
Where are we going?

00:02:18,866 --> 00:02:20,401
Relax.

00:02:20,401 --> 00:02:22,169
Enjoy the ride.

00:02:23,237 --> 00:02:24,705
(car alarm chirps)

00:02:33,247 --> 00:02:35,883
(books clattering)

00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:40,054
(safe dial clicking)

00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,802
How's Maya?

00:02:54,802 --> 00:02:59,106
I gave her something
to calm her.

00:02:59,106 --> 00:03:02,710
I never thought I would see
that in your hand again.

00:03:03,844 --> 00:03:05,312
Neither did I.

SIDLE:
Russell...

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,389
we found some
shoe impressions.

00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:50,024
Some standard work boots.
I'm not sure

00:03:50,024 --> 00:03:51,225
we're gonna get anything.

00:03:51,225 --> 00:03:53,027
And this didn't come
from your house,

00:03:53,027 --> 00:03:54,995
right?
Uh...

00:03:54,995 --> 00:03:56,397
Could be transfer
from the kidnapper.

00:03:56,397 --> 00:03:58,232
I'm gonna get
it to Hodges.

00:03:58,232 --> 00:04:01,869
Uh, listen, th-there's something
else that you need to know.

00:04:01,869 --> 00:04:03,737
"Property of LVPD."

00:04:03,737 --> 00:04:04,972
Found it under the window.

00:04:04,972 --> 00:04:07,808
We're looking at a cop.

00:04:11,745 --> 00:04:14,181
You call Brass, and you
tell him I don't want

00:04:14,181 --> 00:04:16,683
to see anyone here who's
not one of his guys.

00:04:16,683 --> 00:04:18,919
SIDLE:
So, what do you want to do?

00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:21,055
Just work-work the case, please.

00:04:21,055 --> 00:04:22,256
Dad.

00:04:22,256 --> 00:04:24,391
Hey, buddy.

00:04:29,963 --> 00:04:31,698
BRASS:
Officer Tracey.

00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,335
You're relieved
of your duty.

00:04:35,335 --> 00:04:38,005
Officer Mitchell
will take over.

00:04:38,005 --> 00:04:39,773
Now.

00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:47,414
(door unlocks)

00:04:53,187 --> 00:04:55,289
You don't look
like my bus driver.

00:04:55,289 --> 00:04:58,358
You know, I've been
stuck in this cell
sucking my thumb

00:04:58,358 --> 00:05:01,195
for three hours, waiting
for my transport back to Ely.

00:05:01,195 --> 00:05:02,362
On your feet.

00:05:02,362 --> 00:05:04,298
(sighs)

00:05:06,667 --> 00:05:08,936
I'm traveling light
these days, Jim.

00:05:08,936 --> 00:05:10,337
Goes with the uniform.

00:05:10,337 --> 00:05:12,206
(grunts)

00:05:12,206 --> 00:05:14,675
I don't know how

00:05:14,675 --> 00:05:17,010
you've been communicating with
your people on the outside,

00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:20,080
but however you've been
doing it, it's over.

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,449
You don't talk to anyone,
you don't see anyone.

00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:24,084
Not even my lawyer?

00:05:24,084 --> 00:05:25,352
Man's got his rights.

00:05:25,352 --> 00:05:28,856
Not anymore.
Is D.B. on board with this?

00:05:28,856 --> 00:05:31,125
'Cause I think he's really
gonna want to talk to me.

00:05:36,763 --> 00:05:39,366
Anything happens to
that little girl...

00:05:40,767 --> 00:05:42,836
...I got people, too.

00:05:54,715 --> 00:05:57,951
So this is where you take
all your girls?

00:05:59,353 --> 00:06:01,321
This is where I'm taking you.

00:06:17,704 --> 00:06:20,340
(metal detector beeping)

00:06:24,978 --> 00:06:26,446
(low chuckle)

00:06:26,446 --> 00:06:28,215
Moreno?
Yeah.

00:06:28,215 --> 00:06:30,017
Mmm.

00:06:30,017 --> 00:06:31,919
He had his chance.

00:06:34,021 --> 00:06:36,757
Hey, maybe this is a bad idea.

00:06:36,757 --> 00:06:38,825
That's what makes it so good.

00:06:46,934 --> 00:06:50,070
(siren wailing in distance)

00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,772
You asked for a good time,
here it is.

00:06:51,772 --> 00:06:53,006
(Finlay laughs wryly)

00:06:53,006 --> 00:06:54,241
FINLAY: Yeah.

00:06:56,009 --> 00:06:58,145
Nick? Where are you?

00:06:58,145 --> 00:07:00,180
I have been calling and calling.

00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,449
And McKeen unleashed hell...

00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:05,419
tonight on Russell and Ecklie,
and his guys may be after you,

00:07:05,419 --> 00:07:07,788
and I know that you said
that you quit,

00:07:07,788 --> 00:07:09,423
but could you call me, please?

00:07:09,423 --> 00:07:12,826
I, uh... I need your help.

00:07:14,328 --> 00:07:16,797
I need to know
that you're all right.

00:07:19,433 --> 00:07:22,302
(phone chimes)

00:07:27,274 --> 00:07:28,976
(siren whoops)

00:07:28,976 --> 00:07:30,711
Hey, don't worry,
we're safe, everybody.

00:07:30,711 --> 00:07:32,779
The police are here.

00:07:34,815 --> 00:07:37,050
CSI Stokes.

00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:39,052
Lot of people looking
for you tonight.

00:07:39,052 --> 00:07:41,755
Well, thank you for the
information, Mr. Clean.

00:07:41,755 --> 00:07:44,891
Well, I'm just minding
my own business.

00:07:44,891 --> 00:07:47,060
Ruining business, according
to the liquor store owner.

00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,262
We <i>can</i> take you in

00:07:48,262 --> 00:07:50,063
for drunk and disorderly.

00:07:50,063 --> 00:07:52,366
You're right--
I am a little drunk.

00:07:52,366 --> 00:07:55,235
But if you two chuckleheads
don't beat it...

00:07:56,803 --> 00:07:58,205
...it's gonna get disorderly.

00:07:58,205 --> 00:07:59,806
Man's got a gun, Hank.

00:07:59,806 --> 00:08:01,341
Oh, this?
Yes, he does.

00:08:01,341 --> 00:08:02,876
(laughing):
Whoa...

00:08:02,876 --> 00:08:06,313
You're a little slow
on the draw there, Hank.

00:08:06,313 --> 00:08:08,348
I don't even need this.

00:08:11,084 --> 00:08:13,854
There's one beer left.

00:08:13,854 --> 00:08:15,889
I'll fight you for it.

00:08:15,889 --> 00:08:17,457
Could shoot you for it.

00:08:27,668 --> 00:08:30,170
You do think she was
just kidnapped, right?

00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:32,372
I don't know what to think.

00:08:32,372 --> 00:08:36,810
Well, I know one thing:
you shouldn't be doing this.

00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:38,712
It's a conflict of interest,

00:08:38,712 --> 00:08:41,381
and the evidence
will be challenged in court.

00:08:41,381 --> 00:08:45,118
Yeah, I'm not really thinking
about court right now, Sara.

00:08:48,088 --> 00:08:51,892
You want to open up that kit,
or you gonna just stand there?

00:08:59,366 --> 00:09:01,368
He's still in surgery.

00:09:01,368 --> 00:09:03,136
I'll be
all right, David.

00:09:03,136 --> 00:09:04,338
Y-You should get
back to work.

00:09:04,338 --> 00:09:05,839
Are you sure?

00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,140
Yeah.

00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,209
Okay, but if-if you
need anything, call me.

00:09:09,209 --> 00:09:11,011
Yeah.

00:09:14,114 --> 00:09:15,682
I, uh...

00:09:15,682 --> 00:09:18,952
found this change of
clothes in your locker.

00:09:18,952 --> 00:09:22,289
I remember a car...

00:09:22,289 --> 00:09:24,758
the sound of a gun...

00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:28,362
...my-my father lying there,

00:09:28,362 --> 00:09:31,698
but... I didn't see
anything, anyone.

00:09:31,698 --> 00:09:32,966
I'm useless!

00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,805
Still no word from Finn?

00:09:38,805 --> 00:09:40,073
No.

00:09:40,073 --> 00:09:41,308
But Brass talked
to Moreno,

00:09:41,308 --> 00:09:42,843
and evidently, Moreno got

00:09:42,843 --> 00:09:44,311
a text from Finn and...

00:09:44,311 --> 00:09:45,746
he's worried.

00:09:45,746 --> 00:09:46,980
Moreno?

00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,382
You think we can trust him?

00:09:48,382 --> 00:09:50,317
Well, he's gonna be here
in a few minutes.

00:09:50,317 --> 00:09:52,352
You can ask him yourself.

00:10:03,864 --> 00:10:05,899
More transfer.

00:10:05,899 --> 00:10:07,367
Same as I found outside.

00:10:07,367 --> 00:10:09,736
This comes with a bonus.

00:10:09,736 --> 00:10:11,138
Hair.

00:10:15,442 --> 00:10:17,444
ECKLIE:
<i>Karma, Jeffrey.</i>

00:10:17,444 --> 00:10:20,046
<i>Your son paid for your sins.</i>

00:10:20,046 --> 00:10:23,283
One phone call from me,
and your family's
living out of a car.

00:10:23,283 --> 00:10:24,785
You leave my family

00:10:24,785 --> 00:10:25,986
<i>out of this, D.B.</i>

00:10:25,986 --> 00:10:27,421
Karma-- what's it mean?

00:10:27,421 --> 00:10:29,923
Ecklie's words.

00:10:29,923 --> 00:10:33,026
McKeen's sending me
the same message.

00:10:35,929 --> 00:10:37,230
KATIE (distant, echoing):
<i>No...!</i>

00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:40,767
(phone rings)

00:10:44,371 --> 00:10:47,407
I guess I, uh, I should get
all this back to the lab.

00:10:57,951 --> 00:10:59,920
I've been calling you.

00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,355
But I think
you know that.

00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:05,192
(Stokes grunts quietly)

00:11:06,893 --> 00:11:08,662
Yeah, I'm done talking.

00:11:08,662 --> 00:11:10,330
I didn't come
here to talk, Nick.

00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:12,999
I'm came to drag
your ass back to work.

00:11:12,999 --> 00:11:15,168
So, how many beers
have you had exactly?

00:11:15,168 --> 00:11:18,805
Mm... not enough.

00:11:20,707 --> 00:11:23,777
Look, I already
told you, Sara-- I quit.

00:11:23,777 --> 00:11:25,946
Not tonight.

00:11:25,946 --> 00:11:29,316
Tomorrow, you can
do whatever you want.

00:11:45,232 --> 00:11:47,267
This is usually the kind
of place we shut down.

00:11:47,267 --> 00:11:48,668
(Finlay laughs)

00:11:54,207 --> 00:11:56,409
Oh, I'm-I'm good.

00:11:56,409 --> 00:11:58,245
You're not on duty.

00:11:58,245 --> 00:12:00,113
No.

00:12:00,113 --> 00:12:02,916
Or are you?

00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:05,685
(both suddenly laugh)

00:12:09,189 --> 00:12:11,224
I'm bored.

00:12:11,224 --> 00:12:13,393
Thought you wanted to see
how far this was going to go.

00:12:13,393 --> 00:12:14,995
Yeah, where's it going to go?

00:12:14,995 --> 00:12:17,831
Where is it going to go?

00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:33,880
Let's go, guys.

00:12:38,318 --> 00:12:40,921
Door at the end
of the hall.

00:12:46,993 --> 00:12:48,929
You gonna tell me
what's behind the door?

00:12:50,864 --> 00:12:52,866
Come on.

00:12:52,866 --> 00:12:54,701
This is what
you came for.

00:12:57,904 --> 00:12:59,105
Isn't it?

00:13:02,008 --> 00:13:04,444
If you were going to kill me,
you would have done it already.

00:13:06,746 --> 00:13:08,048
We could've had so much fun.

00:13:09,349 --> 00:13:12,152
We still can.

00:13:12,152 --> 00:13:14,955
Open the door.

00:13:20,393 --> 00:13:21,795
Katie.

00:13:21,795 --> 00:13:22,963
(Katie cries)
You're late.

00:13:30,403 --> 00:13:33,039
ROBBINS: Are you sure
you want to do this?

00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:34,908
I have to.

00:13:45,018 --> 00:13:47,153
I am going to kill him.

00:13:48,288 --> 00:13:51,424
You said they would call.

00:13:52,926 --> 00:13:54,127
D.B.?

00:13:57,697 --> 00:13:59,065
You said they'd call.

00:13:59,065 --> 00:14:01,267
They will.

00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:05,305
I like that.

00:14:05,305 --> 00:14:06,973
Is that a new painting?

00:14:06,973 --> 00:14:09,376
I-I've been working
on it for a few weeks.

00:14:09,376 --> 00:14:12,412
I hadn't noticed.

00:14:12,412 --> 00:14:14,180
I guess that's been
happening a lot lately.

00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,449
I'm sorry.

00:14:16,449 --> 00:14:19,185
That's the view from our bedroom
up in Seattle, right?

00:14:20,854 --> 00:14:22,689
You miss it?

00:14:22,689 --> 00:14:25,358
That's not a very good
question to ask me right now.

00:14:25,358 --> 00:14:26,760
I'm sorry,
I don't know what...

00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,961
(sighs)

00:14:31,097 --> 00:14:33,199
The only thing worse than
the thought of losing Katie

00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,901
is the thought of
losing both of you.

00:14:34,901 --> 00:14:37,804
That is not
going to happen.

00:14:37,804 --> 00:14:39,239
D.B.?

00:14:39,239 --> 00:14:40,874
You hear from Finn?

00:14:40,874 --> 00:14:42,108
BRASS: No.

00:14:42,108 --> 00:14:43,777
MORENO: As you know,
I got a text message

00:14:43,777 --> 00:14:45,278
from her a couple hours ago.

00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:47,313
She was with Crenshaw,
said she was onto something.

00:14:47,313 --> 00:14:49,015
And she wanted me to follow
her on the GPS.

00:14:49,015 --> 00:14:50,717
We were tracking her toward
downtown.

00:14:50,717 --> 00:14:52,185
The signal went dead somewhere
around Maryland Parkway.

00:14:52,185 --> 00:14:53,386
Wait, what do you
mean it "went dead"?

00:14:53,386 --> 00:14:54,788
Crenshaw's got a jammer.

00:14:54,788 --> 00:14:56,423
Why-Why would you do that?

00:14:56,423 --> 00:14:58,892
Why would you leave her alone
with some guy you know is dirty?

00:14:58,892 --> 00:15:00,727
She wanted to be alone.

00:15:00,727 --> 00:15:02,162
And there's no way that
I could have seen this coming.

00:15:02,162 --> 00:15:03,329
You know something --
you ought to...

00:15:03,329 --> 00:15:05,065
Listen, look, look.

00:15:05,065 --> 00:15:07,801
I think McKean has blindsided
all of us on this one.

00:15:07,801 --> 00:15:09,402
Radio call, sir.

00:15:09,402 --> 00:15:13,406
Detective Crenshaw--
he's asking for CSI Russell.

00:15:13,406 --> 00:15:16,409
Well, so much for
a tracing a call.

00:15:22,082 --> 00:15:23,850
This is Russell.

00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:25,852
CRENSHAW: I got someone who
wants to say hello.

00:15:28,154 --> 00:15:29,355
Hey, it's me.

00:15:29,355 --> 00:15:30,924
RUSSELL:
Where are you?

00:15:30,924 --> 00:15:32,992
Uh, can't say,
but I'm with Katie.

00:15:32,992 --> 00:15:37,263
and she's okay.

00:15:37,263 --> 00:15:38,698
Grandpa!

00:15:38,698 --> 00:15:40,166
KATIE:
I'm scared.

00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:41,768
Hey, Katie.

00:15:41,768 --> 00:15:43,803
That was proof of life.

00:15:43,803 --> 00:15:45,405
They said that if you want
to see her again...

00:15:45,405 --> 00:15:47,440
...you have to talk to McKeen.

00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,442
Tell those sons of bitches
if they lay a hand on...

00:15:49,442 --> 00:15:51,044
(radio static crackles)

00:15:52,912 --> 00:15:54,314
This is okay.
Where's McKeen?

00:15:54,314 --> 00:15:57,317
He's in holding.

00:15:57,317 --> 00:15:59,152
Now, this isn't just
about McKeen's dead son.

00:15:59,152 --> 00:16:00,353
His empire is crumbling.

00:16:00,353 --> 00:16:01,888
He's burning the house down.

00:16:01,888 --> 00:16:04,057
He's trying to take
us all with it.

00:16:04,057 --> 00:16:06,092
I'm sorry.

00:16:11,431 --> 00:16:13,333
Did Sara give you
some hairs to run?

00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:15,668
Geez, what happened
to your face?

00:16:15,668 --> 00:16:16,936
The hairs, please.

00:16:16,936 --> 00:16:18,805
Right.

00:16:18,805 --> 00:16:21,674
Well, there were no tags,
but DNA wouldn't help anyway.

00:16:21,674 --> 00:16:22,942
'Cause I can tell
you right now,

00:16:22,942 --> 00:16:26,346
they didn't come
from any kidnapper.

00:16:26,346 --> 00:16:27,881
I pulled
exemplars for comparison.

00:16:27,881 --> 00:16:29,082
Uh, hair's not human.

00:16:29,082 --> 00:16:31,217
It's bovine.

00:16:31,217 --> 00:16:35,054
Could still be transfer,
brought in on this guy.

00:16:35,054 --> 00:16:39,926
Maybe we're looking for some
sort of dairy farm, or ranch.

00:16:39,926 --> 00:16:41,961
Lots of those
in the Central Valley.

00:16:41,961 --> 00:16:44,330
Maybe Hodges can help
you narrow it down.

00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:45,865
I wish I had
better news for you.

00:16:45,865 --> 00:16:47,901
The white trace you found
in the shoe impression

00:16:47,901 --> 00:16:50,270
and in Katie's bedroom
is a composite

00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,005
of calcium hydroxide,
gypsum and quartz.

00:16:52,005 --> 00:16:53,206
Plaster.

00:16:53,206 --> 00:16:54,741
Generic, at that.

00:16:54,741 --> 00:16:56,209
Not exactly
a game-changer.

00:16:56,209 --> 00:16:58,778
Patrol found a car
matching the description

00:16:58,778 --> 00:17:00,680
of one fleeing the scene
where Ecklie was shot.

00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,948
This was in the backseat.

00:17:01,948 --> 00:17:03,149
Where's the car now?

00:17:03,149 --> 00:17:04,350
It's in the garage.

00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:06,085
Mandy's on it.

00:17:06,085 --> 00:17:08,221
I'm going to process the gun
and someone needs to go back

00:17:08,221 --> 00:17:09,789
to the hospital
to pick up the pellets

00:17:09,789 --> 00:17:10,990
that were removed from Ecklie.

00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:12,325
I'll go.

00:17:12,325 --> 00:17:15,762
DOCTOR: That's about
all we can do for now.

00:17:15,762 --> 00:17:16,963
Okay.

00:17:29,909 --> 00:17:31,144
He's going to be okay.

00:17:31,144 --> 00:17:35,114
That's good news.

00:17:35,114 --> 00:17:38,718
I thought I lost him.

00:17:38,718 --> 00:17:42,155
The whole time in the...
in the waiting room,

00:17:42,155 --> 00:17:45,258
I kept thinking to myself,
if he dies, it's my fault.

00:17:45,258 --> 00:17:48,094
There's nothing
you could've done.

00:17:48,094 --> 00:17:51,331
That's not what I mean.

00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:57,270
When I was a kid...

00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:59,873
I was so angry at him.

00:17:59,873 --> 00:18:03,343
Do you know how
many times I prayed...

00:18:03,343 --> 00:18:05,278
that he would get shot?

00:18:08,214 --> 00:18:10,250
That's not your fault, either.

00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:23,029
I'm sorry.

00:18:31,838 --> 00:18:35,074
Where's your buddy Brass?

00:18:35,074 --> 00:18:36,309
This is what you want,
isn't it?

00:18:36,309 --> 00:18:38,144
Maybe it's what you want.

00:18:38,144 --> 00:18:39,712
I'm in no mood for games.

00:18:39,712 --> 00:18:42,048
So there is a real cop
in there somewhere.

00:18:42,048 --> 00:18:44,684
That's good to know.

00:18:44,684 --> 00:18:46,386
'Cause maybe then we can
have an understanding.

00:18:46,386 --> 00:18:48,121
What is it that you want?

00:18:48,121 --> 00:18:50,189
You want to trade my
granddaughter for your freedom?

00:18:50,189 --> 00:18:51,391
Is that it?

00:18:51,391 --> 00:18:54,193
Don't insult me, D.B.

00:18:54,193 --> 00:18:55,929
That'll never be on the table.

00:18:57,263 --> 00:18:59,198
You know, you CSIs,
you're all the same.

00:18:59,198 --> 00:19:03,903
You're-you're so busy
with your black-lights

00:19:03,903 --> 00:19:06,005
and your little tweezers
and your spray bottles.

00:19:06,005 --> 00:19:08,174
(mimicking hiss
of a spray bottle)

00:19:08,174 --> 00:19:10,810
Who do you think you're
kidding with that thing?

00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:13,012
What do you want?

00:19:13,012 --> 00:19:14,213
What do I want?

00:19:15,915 --> 00:19:17,717
What do I want?

00:19:17,717 --> 00:19:19,819
You know, you were so
obsessed with the "how,"

00:19:19,819 --> 00:19:21,821
that you never asked
yourself the "why"--

00:19:21,821 --> 00:19:23,690
<i>Why Donny Price got popped.</i>

00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:26,326
<i>Why Veronica Gilmore</i>
<i>was beaten to death.</i>

00:19:26,326 --> 00:19:30,830
Why Jack Gilmore was
"innocently" framed?

00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,665
You're saying Jack Gilmore
wasn't innocent?

00:19:32,665 --> 00:19:35,668
I'm saying Jack Gilmore used
his whore of a wife

00:19:35,668 --> 00:19:38,371
to steal $2 million in drug
money from Donny Price.

00:19:38,371 --> 00:19:40,773
From me.

00:19:40,773 --> 00:19:42,842
Collateral for his stadium.

00:19:42,842 --> 00:19:45,044
I want what's mine.

00:19:45,044 --> 00:19:46,946
For my family.

00:19:46,946 --> 00:19:49,949
You want me to get $2 million?

00:19:49,949 --> 00:19:51,751
From Jack Gilmore?

00:19:51,751 --> 00:19:54,921
You get me my money back and
you get your granddaughter back.

00:19:54,921 --> 00:19:56,255
You got 12 hours.

00:19:56,255 --> 00:19:58,358
Now I got people
waiting by a phone,

00:19:58,358 --> 00:20:02,128
and if they don't
hear from me, well, eh...

00:20:02,128 --> 00:20:04,330
(mimicking the hiss
of a spray bottle)

00:20:06,366 --> 00:20:08,868
I take care of your family,
you take care of mine.

00:20:08,868 --> 00:20:10,103
Is that it?

00:20:10,103 --> 00:20:12,271
Karma.

00:20:21,914 --> 00:20:23,149
Where's Grandpa?

00:20:23,149 --> 00:20:24,684
Will he find us?

00:20:24,684 --> 00:20:25,885
Aw, honey.

00:20:25,885 --> 00:20:27,320
Don't worry.

00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,088
I am going to bring you home
to see him, okay?

00:20:29,088 --> 00:20:30,289
And Grandma.

00:20:30,289 --> 00:20:31,891
Mommy, too?

00:20:31,891 --> 00:20:33,426
Of course you're going
to see your mommy.

00:20:33,426 --> 00:20:36,429
Okay, but until then,
I really need you to be brave.

00:20:36,429 --> 00:20:37,797
Okay.

00:20:37,797 --> 00:20:39,232
Okay.

00:20:41,401 --> 00:20:43,236
(traffic driving by outside)

00:20:47,974 --> 00:20:50,877
I'm scared.

00:20:50,877 --> 00:20:54,047
Hey. I am going to go up
there and look at that.

00:20:54,047 --> 00:20:55,248
And you go sit down.

00:20:55,248 --> 00:20:56,449
Okay.

00:21:19,272 --> 00:21:22,008
How are you supposed to get Jack
Gilmore to give you $2 million?

00:21:22,008 --> 00:21:23,342
I have no idea.

00:21:23,342 --> 00:21:25,078
Brass said the guy's
dropped out of sight.

00:21:25,078 --> 00:21:26,345
Vanished.

00:21:26,345 --> 00:21:29,348
Probably hiding
from McKeen, right?

00:21:29,348 --> 00:21:30,750
Card's clean,
no prints.

00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:33,119
Tear it apart--
ink, card stock, paper,

00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:34,821
maybe it'll tell us
where it came from.

00:21:34,821 --> 00:21:36,155
And who put it together.

00:21:36,155 --> 00:21:38,191
(phone rings)
Yeah?

00:21:38,191 --> 00:21:39,725
Maya just talked to Ryan.

00:21:39,725 --> 00:21:41,027
His flight was canceled.

00:21:41,027 --> 00:21:43,429
He's catching
the next plane, but...

00:21:43,429 --> 00:21:44,864
Well, she's hysterical.

00:21:44,864 --> 00:21:46,265
She's asking for you.

00:21:46,265 --> 00:21:47,700
All right,
I-I'm on my way.

00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,402
If you get anything,
call me right away.

00:21:49,402 --> 00:21:50,970
We're down to ten hours
and counting.

00:22:20,199 --> 00:22:22,768
STOKES:
McKeen's number one guy.

00:22:22,768 --> 00:22:25,338
Kimball is definitely
our kidnapper.

00:22:27,206 --> 00:22:29,242
Well, the text and images
on these letters

00:22:29,242 --> 00:22:32,078
looks like some
sort of escort rag.

00:22:32,078 --> 00:22:34,247
Like magazines you see on the
streets downtown, right?

00:22:34,247 --> 00:22:37,783
Advertisements for strip
joints, sex clubs, brothels.

00:22:37,783 --> 00:22:39,852
STOKES: Yeah, but they
all look the same.

00:22:39,852 --> 00:22:41,721
Well, luckily, not
to the micro-FTIR.

00:22:41,721 --> 00:22:43,789
I ran the paper stock.

00:22:43,789 --> 00:22:45,992
It's Zurvan Photo Select M-1.

00:22:45,992 --> 00:22:47,793
Discontinued in '08.

00:22:47,793 --> 00:22:49,095
Pretty specific.

00:22:49,095 --> 00:22:50,329
According to the manufacturer,

00:22:50,329 --> 00:22:52,798
only one printing company
in Vegas used it.

00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:54,667
Place went out of business
a couple months ago.

00:22:54,667 --> 00:22:56,836
Who's using the old paper
to print ads for hookers?

00:22:56,836 --> 00:22:58,037
Maybe the new tenants.

00:22:58,037 --> 00:22:59,705
A sex club called PD7.

00:22:59,705 --> 00:23:01,107
Okay, honey, keep going.

00:23:01,107 --> 00:23:02,341
I'm scared.
I know.

00:23:02,341 --> 00:23:03,743
It's okay.

00:23:03,743 --> 00:23:04,944
You can do it.
(loud banging)

00:23:04,944 --> 00:23:06,145
What's that?

00:23:06,145 --> 00:23:07,346
CRENSHAW:
Hey!

00:23:07,346 --> 00:23:09,382
What the hell?
Open this damn door!

00:23:09,382 --> 00:23:11,784
Katie, I need you to go now
and I need you to go fast.

00:23:11,784 --> 00:23:13,953
Go, sweetie, fast.
I'll find you.

00:23:13,953 --> 00:23:17,690
(Crenshaw slamming into door)

00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:18,891
Kick it in.

00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:25,965
What the hell?

00:23:25,965 --> 00:23:27,800
I got the back,
you take the front.

00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,754
(grunts)

00:23:59,031 --> 00:24:00,233
(screams)

00:24:18,251 --> 00:24:21,087
(Finlay yells)

00:24:22,822 --> 00:24:26,058
(Finlay grunts, screams)

00:24:28,094 --> 00:24:30,429
(handcuffs ratcheting)

00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:34,667
(whimpers, gasps)

00:24:37,803 --> 00:24:40,940
I told you we were going
to have so much fun.

00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:53,219
(gunshot)

00:24:56,355 --> 00:24:57,757
You okay?

00:24:57,757 --> 00:24:59,425
Yeah, we've have to find Katie.

00:25:04,297 --> 00:25:06,132
Oh! She's not in there.

00:25:06,132 --> 00:25:08,801
(siren approaching)
Where the hell is she?

00:25:08,801 --> 00:25:11,070
Katie!

00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:12,271
Katie!

00:25:12,271 --> 00:25:14,373
(siren blaring)

00:25:19,011 --> 00:25:20,346
FINLAY:
I am sorry.

00:25:20,346 --> 00:25:22,081
I just thought that
if I could get her out--

00:25:22,081 --> 00:25:23,382
RUSSELL:
I don't need you to think.

00:25:23,382 --> 00:25:25,951
I need you to be smart, Finn.

00:25:25,951 --> 00:25:28,854
Wh-Why would you let yourself
get separated like that?

00:25:28,854 --> 00:25:30,256
She's a child, for God's sake.

00:25:30,256 --> 00:25:31,991
And now she's out
there all by herself.

00:25:31,991 --> 00:25:33,993
All right, all right, look.

00:25:33,993 --> 00:25:36,228
There-There's four hours
left on McKeen's deadline.

00:25:36,228 --> 00:25:37,396
Get to the hospital.

00:25:37,396 --> 00:25:38,798
Check yourself out.

00:25:38,798 --> 00:25:39,999
And then go
back to the lab.

00:25:39,999 --> 00:25:41,200
I'm fine.

00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,401
(phone beeps off)

00:25:43,869 --> 00:25:46,072
We will find her.

00:25:46,072 --> 00:25:50,343
Please calm down and go
and talk to your daughter.

00:25:50,343 --> 00:25:52,812
MORENO: We searched the building
and the surrounding area.

00:25:52,812 --> 00:25:54,146
No Katie.

00:25:54,146 --> 00:25:55,915
Brass put a BOLO out
on Kimball's car.

00:25:55,915 --> 00:25:57,283
And your team's
processing the club.

00:25:57,283 --> 00:25:58,684
That's it.

00:25:58,684 --> 00:26:01,020
Don't beat yourself up.

00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,688
You found Katie.

00:26:02,688 --> 00:26:04,156
I was supposed
to bring her home.

00:26:04,156 --> 00:26:05,925
You did what you could.

00:26:07,393 --> 00:26:09,929
Thanks for saving my life.

00:26:12,832 --> 00:26:14,033
You knew I would.

00:26:23,042 --> 00:26:25,411
I was... (inhales)

00:26:25,411 --> 00:26:30,349
so happy to have
a moment to myself.

00:26:30,349 --> 00:26:32,118
To let you read to her.

00:26:32,118 --> 00:26:35,121
Put her to bed.

00:26:35,121 --> 00:26:37,723
(sighs)
And now...

00:26:37,723 --> 00:26:38,991
Please don't do this
to yourself.

00:26:38,991 --> 00:26:40,326
Please don't.

00:26:40,326 --> 00:26:44,930
When I was little,
I always felt so safe.

00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:47,099
You always made
me feel so safe.

00:26:47,099 --> 00:26:50,836
You said that no harm
could come to us.

00:26:50,836 --> 00:26:52,872
To our home.

00:26:52,872 --> 00:26:56,008
This isn't our home.

00:26:56,008 --> 00:26:57,777
What is this place?

00:26:57,777 --> 00:26:58,978
I-I hate it.

00:26:58,978 --> 00:27:00,179
Hey, hey, come on.

00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:01,747
We can't give
up hope, all right?

00:27:01,747 --> 00:27:03,916
(sighs)

00:27:03,916 --> 00:27:06,786
I know what happened.

00:27:06,786 --> 00:27:08,754
When we were in Seattle.

00:27:08,754 --> 00:27:10,289
The murders on campus.

00:27:10,289 --> 00:27:14,827
You lied to me back then.

00:27:14,827 --> 00:27:16,262
(Russell sighs)
And now...

00:27:16,262 --> 00:27:17,797
stop lying.

00:27:17,797 --> 00:27:20,666
I was trying to protect us...

00:27:20,666 --> 00:27:22,368
Stop lying.

00:27:28,073 --> 00:27:30,075
(monitor beeping quietly)

00:27:42,254 --> 00:27:43,456
Hey.

00:27:43,456 --> 00:27:45,291
Hey.

00:27:45,291 --> 00:27:46,892
You're okay.

00:27:46,892 --> 00:27:48,828
Ah, thank God.

00:27:48,828 --> 00:27:51,664
You're going to be okay, too.

00:27:51,664 --> 00:27:53,265
Yeah?

00:27:53,265 --> 00:27:57,136
It was McKeen, wasn't it?

00:27:57,136 --> 00:27:59,138
Mm-hm.

00:28:01,106 --> 00:28:04,109
He go after anybody else?

00:28:04,109 --> 00:28:06,712
He, uh, got
Russell's granddaughter.

00:28:06,712 --> 00:28:07,913
They're looking for her now.

00:28:07,913 --> 00:28:10,716
You can't worry about that.

00:28:10,716 --> 00:28:12,418
You ha...

00:28:12,418 --> 00:28:16,121
You have to get your rest
and you have to get strong.

00:28:16,121 --> 00:28:19,992
I'm glad you're here.

00:28:19,992 --> 00:28:21,193
I love you, M.

00:28:25,965 --> 00:28:28,267
I love you too, Dad.

00:28:43,182 --> 00:28:45,751
(door unlocks)

00:28:53,125 --> 00:28:55,027
So you followed the evidence...

00:28:55,027 --> 00:28:57,196
but you didn't
get her back.

00:29:02,968 --> 00:29:04,403
Where is she?

00:29:04,403 --> 00:29:06,672
It's not going
to be that easy, D.B.

00:29:06,672 --> 00:29:08,073
Where?

00:29:08,073 --> 00:29:10,376
You didn't really think
I was going to give her

00:29:10,376 --> 00:29:12,144
back to you alive, did you?

00:29:15,881 --> 00:29:18,851
Ah, that's what I thought.

00:29:18,851 --> 00:29:21,887
Just like Stokes.

00:29:21,887 --> 00:29:25,190
(Russell screams,
gunshot pops, body thuds)

00:29:29,762 --> 00:29:31,030
STOKES:
<i>That's a good kill.</i>

00:29:32,398 --> 00:29:33,999
Don't worry,
I got your back.

00:29:33,999 --> 00:29:36,936
Russell?

00:29:36,936 --> 00:29:40,172
Hey, Russell.

00:29:40,172 --> 00:29:42,775
Where are we?

00:29:42,775 --> 00:29:46,278
Uh, Sara found more plaster and
bovine hair in Crenshaw's car.

00:29:46,278 --> 00:29:48,047
Well, what good is that?

00:29:48,047 --> 00:29:50,049
I mean, we're already
speculating that these guys

00:29:50,049 --> 00:29:52,318
are spending time at a ranch
or a farm somewhere.

00:29:52,318 --> 00:29:55,054
Not just somewhere.
Right there.

00:29:55,054 --> 00:29:56,889
ROBBINS: Found a fungus
in Crenshaw's lungs.

00:29:56,889 --> 00:29:59,191
<i>Coccidioides Immitis.</i>

00:29:59,191 --> 00:30:01,026
Causes Valley Fever.

00:30:01,026 --> 00:30:03,662
There's been a cluster of cases
reported in that area.

00:30:03,662 --> 00:30:07,199
This is like 40
square miles of desert.

00:30:07,199 --> 00:30:09,768
I mean, how the hell
are we supposed to...

00:30:09,768 --> 00:30:11,837
We have one hour left
on McKeen's deadline.

00:30:11,837 --> 00:30:13,405
One hour.

00:30:13,405 --> 00:30:16,175
That is, if-if Finn's botched
attempt to rescue Katie

00:30:16,175 --> 00:30:17,676
hasn't gotten
her killed already.

00:30:17,676 --> 00:30:19,411
So, if she's alive, cow hair

00:30:19,411 --> 00:30:21,747
and Valley Fever are
not going to bring her home.

00:30:21,747 --> 00:30:24,683
Bring me something that can,
will you, please?

00:30:24,683 --> 00:30:26,819
Go!

00:30:26,819 --> 00:30:29,421
(phone ringing)

00:30:31,824 --> 00:30:34,960
Hey. How's Maya?

00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,228
(sighs)

00:30:36,228 --> 00:30:37,963
I'm gonna have
to call you back.

00:30:37,963 --> 00:30:39,198
Are you deaf?

00:30:39,198 --> 00:30:41,233
Or is this
you quitting again?

00:30:48,407 --> 00:30:50,976
You got something
you want to say?

00:30:50,976 --> 00:30:53,712
After Jack Gilmore's
wife was murdered,

00:30:53,712 --> 00:30:56,181
Finlay got a warrant
from Brass for his phone.

00:30:56,181 --> 00:30:57,716
It's still active.

00:30:57,716 --> 00:30:59,685
And he's still
making phone calls.

00:30:59,685 --> 00:31:04,456
Everybody is looking
for Jack Gilmore.

00:31:04,456 --> 00:31:05,958
I know where to find him.

00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:19,371
(remote chirps)

00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:26,111
(tires screech)

00:31:29,815 --> 00:31:31,383
Hey, Jack.

00:31:31,383 --> 00:31:33,719
Hey, you want to tell me what
the hell this is about?

00:31:33,719 --> 00:31:37,289
McKeen told me about
the $2 million in drug money

00:31:37,289 --> 00:31:39,324
that you had your wife
steal from Donny Price.

00:31:39,324 --> 00:31:41,193
That's why
McKeen had them killed

00:31:41,193 --> 00:31:43,729
and you kept your mouth shut,
even when he tried to frame you.

00:31:43,729 --> 00:31:46,331
He wants his money back.
I-I-I don't know what
you're talking about.

00:31:46,331 --> 00:31:47,933
I don't have much time.

00:31:47,933 --> 00:31:49,201
(scoffs)
Come on, man.

00:31:49,201 --> 00:31:50,903
Who you kidding?

00:31:50,903 --> 00:31:52,104
You're not going
to shoot me.

00:31:52,104 --> 00:31:53,305
You're the good cop.

00:31:53,305 --> 00:31:54,740
I'm not.

00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:56,709
I quit last night.

00:31:56,709 --> 00:31:59,178
All right, guys, look...
you're a little late, okay?

00:31:59,178 --> 00:32:01,346
What does that mean-- "late"?
That means that I already

00:32:01,346 --> 00:32:02,981
gave McKeen the money.

00:32:02,981 --> 00:32:04,249
Hey, I swear to God.

00:32:04,249 --> 00:32:06,018
My lawyer made the drop.
Ask him.

00:32:08,954 --> 00:32:10,956
You didn't think two million
bucks was going to get

00:32:10,956 --> 00:32:14,460
your granddaughter back
from a guy like McKeen, did ya?

00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,829
(scoffs)

00:32:17,996 --> 00:32:19,231
She's dead.

00:32:22,901 --> 00:32:25,671
(horn honking)

00:32:30,843 --> 00:32:32,845
OFFICER (over radio):
David-64, secured rooftop

00:32:32,845 --> 00:32:34,279
of adjacent building.

00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:35,681
What the hell were you thinking?

00:32:35,681 --> 00:32:36,882
You lied to me.

00:32:36,882 --> 00:32:38,217
I didn't lie to you.

00:32:38,217 --> 00:32:40,119
You told me that Gilmore
was nowhere to be found.

00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:41,687
We found him
with your warrant,

00:32:41,687 --> 00:32:43,322
so you knew where he was
the whole time, right?

00:32:43,322 --> 00:32:44,723
Stokes, shut up.

00:32:44,723 --> 00:32:45,958
Yeah, that's right.

00:32:45,958 --> 00:32:48,227
Gilmore was a material witness

00:32:48,227 --> 00:32:51,096
in an ongoing police
corruption investigation.

00:32:51,096 --> 00:32:52,898
Which, by the way, you
completely screwed up

00:32:52,898 --> 00:32:54,666
by going going full
cowboy on some scheme

00:32:54,666 --> 00:32:55,901
to extort drug
money for ransom.

00:32:55,901 --> 00:32:57,269
No, no, listen to me.

00:32:57,269 --> 00:32:58,937
We're talking
about my granddaughter.

00:32:58,937 --> 00:33:00,405
What, you think
don't understand that?

00:33:00,405 --> 00:33:01,807
No, I don't.

00:33:01,807 --> 00:33:03,008
You're not behaving that way.

00:33:03,008 --> 00:33:04,209
Hey, you know what?

00:33:04,209 --> 00:33:05,410
Look, when you processed
your own house,

00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:07,012
I didn't say anything.

00:33:07,012 --> 00:33:08,347
When you walked into McKeen's
cell by yourself,

00:33:08,347 --> 00:33:10,115
I didn't stop you.

00:33:10,115 --> 00:33:11,784
You want to know why I didn't
tell you where Gilmore was?

00:33:11,784 --> 00:33:13,085
Because I knew it would
end up exactly like this.

00:33:13,085 --> 00:33:14,319
Look, don't you get it?

00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:16,121
McKeen knew he was going
to get his money.

00:33:16,121 --> 00:33:18,824
The only thing
he couldn't get was Gilmore.

00:33:18,824 --> 00:33:20,225
He needed you
to find him.

00:33:20,225 --> 00:33:22,227
So...

00:33:23,796 --> 00:33:26,431
(sighing heavily):
D.B., go home.

00:33:28,801 --> 00:33:30,969
Be with your family.

00:33:30,969 --> 00:33:33,672
BRASS:
Get some CSIs here.

00:33:42,114 --> 00:33:44,116
Hey.

00:33:46,785 --> 00:33:48,287
Barbara called you, huh?

00:33:48,287 --> 00:33:50,022
Yeah, I can see why.

00:33:50,022 --> 00:33:52,424
You're lying in Katie's
bed in case files.

00:33:52,424 --> 00:33:54,293
She's really worried about you.

00:33:54,293 --> 00:33:56,395
I can't believe
how wrong I've been.

00:33:56,395 --> 00:33:59,097
I mean, this whole time,
willing myself to believe

00:33:59,097 --> 00:34:00,699
that she's still alive

00:34:00,699 --> 00:34:03,335
when the facts say so clearly
that she is.

00:34:04,436 --> 00:34:05,838
I'm, I'm not losing it.

00:34:05,838 --> 00:34:08,207
Just... listen to this.

00:34:08,207 --> 00:34:10,142
Yes, Katie
should be dead,

00:34:10,142 --> 00:34:11,810
but so should you.

00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:14,146
After proof of life,
they didn't need you,

00:34:14,146 --> 00:34:16,448
<i>but they kept you both alive.</i>
<i>Why?</i>

00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:18,784
<i>In your case, 'cause Crenshaw</i>
<i>is a scumbag and he wanted</i>

00:34:18,784 --> 00:34:20,452
<i>something more</i>
<i>than just your life,</i>

00:34:20,452 --> 00:34:23,055
<i>but, but Katie-- Kimball didn't</i>
<i>just see a hostage.</i>

00:34:23,055 --> 00:34:24,423
<i>He saw a child.</i>

00:34:24,423 --> 00:34:26,325
I mean, look at this,
the guy is divorced, right?

00:34:26,325 --> 00:34:28,060
He's got three kids.

00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:30,996
Th-The youngest one is like
this 7√-year-old little girl,

00:34:30,996 --> 00:34:34,132
same age as Katie.
Okay, so, going with that,

00:34:34,132 --> 00:34:36,869
why would Kimball
still be in town?

00:34:36,869 --> 00:34:38,237
Out of loyalty, right?

00:34:38,237 --> 00:34:41,106
He wanted to do
one last job for McKeen.

00:34:41,106 --> 00:34:43,275
Deliver the $2 million
to the family.
Right.

00:34:43,275 --> 00:34:45,143
But with the heat on,
how does he do that?

00:34:45,143 --> 00:34:46,778
I don't know, I don't--
that's the part

00:34:46,778 --> 00:34:47,980
I don't know,
but I don't think

00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,381
he does either.

00:34:49,381 --> 00:34:51,183
You know, maybe he's,
maybe he's laying low

00:34:51,183 --> 00:34:52,818
until he can
figure out what to do,

00:34:52,818 --> 00:34:54,786
but I do know he's out there
and so's Katie.

00:34:54,786 --> 00:34:58,824
We have 40 square miles
of desert and all we have

00:34:58,824 --> 00:35:00,192
is cow hair and plaster.

00:35:00,192 --> 00:35:02,194
I know, I know.

00:35:02,194 --> 00:35:03,729
Oh, my God,
I can't believe it.

00:35:03,729 --> 00:35:05,397
I can't believe it.
What?

00:35:05,397 --> 00:35:06,899
What?
I didn't even see that.

00:35:06,899 --> 00:35:08,400
Damn it!

00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,801
D.B.!

00:35:09,801 --> 00:35:11,303
Look at that. See that?

00:35:11,303 --> 00:35:13,305
It's not, it's not
hair and plaster,

00:35:13,305 --> 00:35:15,073
it's hair <i>in</i> plaster.

00:35:15,073 --> 00:35:16,308
Before World War II,

00:35:16,308 --> 00:35:18,076
they used to use
animal hair in plaster

00:35:18,076 --> 00:35:20,412
as, as a binding agent
or something.

00:35:20,412 --> 00:35:22,114
There can't be
that many houses out there

00:35:22,114 --> 00:35:23,882
from that era still standing
in the desert.

00:35:23,882 --> 00:35:25,684
SIDLE:
<i>You're right,</i>

00:35:25,684 --> 00:35:27,219
I've got the county assessor
records in front of me now.

00:35:27,219 --> 00:35:28,420
Nine properties

00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:29,821
fit the description.

00:35:29,821 --> 00:35:31,690
Any of them have
a connection to McKeen?

00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:33,825
SIDLE:
I'm going through the deeds--
nothing so far.

00:35:33,825 --> 00:35:35,327
I found a cartridge case

00:35:35,327 --> 00:35:37,362
on the rooftop across
from where Gilmore was shot.

00:35:37,362 --> 00:35:38,730
It's a .223.

00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:40,065
Matches the bullet
that killed him.

00:35:40,065 --> 00:35:41,833
Tell me you got a print.

00:35:41,833 --> 00:35:45,704
I did, and a hit--
an ex-cop named Earl Whitson.

00:35:45,704 --> 00:35:47,773
He, uh, grew up with McKeen.

00:35:47,773 --> 00:35:50,375
SANDERS: Actually, McKeen is
the godfather to his daughter.

00:35:50,375 --> 00:35:51,977
I checked cell phone records.

00:35:51,977 --> 00:35:53,378
He was in the vicinity
last night,

00:35:53,378 --> 00:35:54,813
when Ecklie was shot.

00:35:54,813 --> 00:35:56,214
That can't be a coincidence.

00:35:56,214 --> 00:35:57,916
SIDLE: It's not-- because
Mm-mm.

00:35:57,916 --> 00:36:00,185
I have a Mary Whitson at 21525

00:36:00,185 --> 00:36:02,854
Sage Willow Road,
off Highway 26.

00:36:02,854 --> 00:36:05,057
RUSSELL:
<i>Call Brass.</i>

00:36:16,101 --> 00:36:18,170
We have a deal.

00:36:19,938 --> 00:36:21,907
Let's go.

00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:33,885
Earl Whitson.

00:36:33,885 --> 00:36:35,687
Yeah, retired cop.

00:36:35,687 --> 00:36:39,391
Dave Beck... Dennis Melky.

00:36:39,391 --> 00:36:40,826
Both worked Vice
with Kimball.

00:36:40,826 --> 00:36:43,095
Hmm, probably worked
for McKeen, too.

00:36:43,095 --> 00:36:45,430
BRASS:
Kimball is obviously
tying up loose ends.

00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:46,965
OFFICER:
It's all clear.

00:36:46,965 --> 00:36:48,800
Didn't find the girl.

00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,069
OFFICER (over radio): Suspect
sighted-- rear of the house.

Vehicle on the move.

00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:53,972
(siren chirps, tires screech)

00:36:53,972 --> 00:36:56,408
(cars crash)

00:36:56,408 --> 00:36:58,377
Hold it right there.

00:36:59,711 --> 00:37:01,013
Drop the gun now.

00:37:01,013 --> 00:37:03,915
Give it up, Paul.

00:37:03,915 --> 00:37:05,317
Gave up everything
a long time ago,

00:37:05,317 --> 00:37:07,386
when I got in
bed with McKeen.

00:37:07,386 --> 00:37:08,787
Come on,
there's still time

00:37:08,787 --> 00:37:09,988
to make some of it right.

00:37:09,988 --> 00:37:12,357
(chuckles)

00:37:12,357 --> 00:37:14,359
I'm a lot of things.

00:37:16,795 --> 00:37:18,764
But not a rat.

00:37:25,003 --> 00:37:27,005
(Kimball panting)

00:37:28,974 --> 00:37:30,976
Where is she?

00:37:30,976 --> 00:37:32,277
Should have let me die.

00:37:32,277 --> 00:37:34,413
Where's the girl?

00:37:36,748 --> 00:37:39,184
She's here.

00:38:04,042 --> 00:38:05,877
Oh, God.

00:38:19,858 --> 00:38:21,259
(gasps)
The man told me

00:38:21,259 --> 00:38:22,694
to hide.

00:38:22,694 --> 00:38:25,030
I cut my hand.

Actually, McKeen,

00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,990
your bus isn't
going back to Ely.

00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:28,727
See, I made a humanitarian
phone call to the governor,

00:39:28,727 --> 00:39:31,830
reminding him how hard
it is for a cop to,

00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:34,032
to survive in
general population.

with the D.A.'s Office

00:40:08,333 --> 00:40:10,402

linked to the former
Undersheriff Jeffrey McKeen.

00:40:13,438 --> 00:40:14,973
The commission report
is due out--

00:40:14,973 --> 00:40:19,077
Sounds like the LVPD
is making a comeback.

00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:22,681
How about you, Nick?

00:40:23,715 --> 00:40:25,750
What about me?

00:40:27,419 --> 00:40:30,789
I don't know;
I haven't talked to Russell yet.

00:40:30,789 --> 00:40:33,124
This isn't
about Russell.

00:40:33,124 --> 00:40:34,926
Words have consequences,
you know.

00:40:34,926 --> 00:40:36,695
I mean, if you
say you quit,

00:40:36,695 --> 00:40:38,997
you need to mean it.

00:40:38,997 --> 00:40:41,032
You quit.
Well, yeah, but I
didn't say it out loud.

00:40:41,032 --> 00:40:43,301
I left a note
at Reception for Grissom

00:40:43,301 --> 00:40:45,270
and I walked
right on out of here.

00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:47,872
And you're still here, so don't
preach to me about integrity.

00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:49,140
Okay?
Wait a minute.

00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:50,875
I am not preaching
to you about integrity.

00:40:50,875 --> 00:40:52,377
Kind of are a little bit,
don't you think?

00:40:52,377 --> 00:40:54,012
I went away for a while
and I got

00:40:54,012 --> 00:40:55,680
my head together.
You got a lot of nerve

00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,716
to talk to me about quitting,
you really do.

00:40:57,716 --> 00:40:59,284
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

00:40:59,284 --> 00:41:01,920
This is not how family
treats each other.

00:41:03,188 --> 00:41:04,756
Actually it is,

00:41:04,756 --> 00:41:06,324
but we are also

00:41:06,324 --> 00:41:07,726
a team,

00:41:07,726 --> 00:41:09,394
and that means
that we have

00:41:09,394 --> 00:41:12,664
to trust that we have each
other's back, no matter what.

00:41:13,898 --> 00:41:15,333
So are you in

00:41:29,214 --> 00:41:30,915
You shouldn't be looking
at those.

00:41:32,384 --> 00:41:34,386
Why?

00:41:34,386 --> 00:41:36,121
This is our life,
isn't it?

00:41:36,121 --> 00:41:38,356
That's not fair.

00:41:38,356 --> 00:41:41,459
I can't live like
this anymore.

00:41:41,459 --> 00:41:44,929

00:41:56,107 --> 00:41:58,109
Are you okay?

00:41:58,109 --> 00:41:59,844
Yeah, yeah.

00:41:59,844 --> 00:42:01,379
Sorry.

00:42:01,379 --> 00:42:03,381
No, it's all good.

00:42:07,218 --> 00:42:09,688
Jules, are you gonna
stay for dinner?

00:42:09,688 --> 00:42:10,889
Oh, I'd love to.

00:42:10,889 --> 00:42:12,223
Great.
Thank you.

00:42:12,223 --> 00:42:15,193
Honey, will you come
help me in the kitchen?

00:42:15,193 --> 00:42:16,394
I can help.

00:42:16,394 --> 00:42:18,363
No, no, I got it.

00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:22,801
Hey, come here,
come here.
