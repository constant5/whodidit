00:00:05,261 --> 00:00:08,231
(cheering, chatter)

00:00:11,127 --> 00:00:12,287
(horn toots)

00:00:12,287 --> 00:00:13,467
Boy, there's a lot
of live ones tonight, huh?

00:00:13,467 --> 00:00:15,435
I know. You're used
to the dead ones.

00:00:15,435 --> 00:00:17,638
Yeah, they're a lot
easier to work with.

00:00:17,638 --> 00:00:19,139
Thanks for coming out,
helping us grunts

00:00:19,139 --> 00:00:20,140
in the Mobile
Crime Unit.

00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,742
You're welcome.

00:00:21,742 --> 00:00:23,710
All the problems in
the department lately--

00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:25,579
it's, uh, been hard making
cases stick, you know?
Uh-huh.

00:00:25,579 --> 00:00:26,747
Well, that's
why I'm here.

00:00:26,747 --> 00:00:27,948
You deal with
the whack-jobs,

00:00:27,948 --> 00:00:29,850
and I'll do
the evidence collecting.

00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:33,120
I'd like to think I'm going
to miss all this, but I ain't.

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,522
What do you mean? You're not
quitting, are you, Crawford?

00:00:35,522 --> 00:00:37,758
No, I'm, uh, looking
at a promotion.

00:00:37,758 --> 00:00:38,926
Really?

00:00:38,926 --> 00:00:39,960
Yeah. Detective.

00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,628
A lot of
opportunities now,

00:00:41,628 --> 00:00:43,997
so I'm gonna trade in
my uniform for a suit.

00:00:43,997 --> 00:00:45,899
Well, congratulations,
Detective.

00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:47,734
Thank you.

00:00:47,734 --> 00:00:50,070
Yeah, it's, uh... it's
got a nice ring to it.

00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,072
Yeah, it does.

00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:59,112
Excuse me, miss.

00:00:59,112 --> 00:01:02,182
Can we talk to you, please?
I ain't doing nothing
wrong, Officer.

00:01:02,182 --> 00:01:03,917
Well, you're not doing
anything right, either.

00:01:03,917 --> 00:01:05,953
CRAWFORD:
What's your name?

00:01:05,953 --> 00:01:07,754
Chastity.

00:01:07,754 --> 00:01:09,990
Can I see some I.D., please?

00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,759
Lost it.

00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:13,927
But you didn't lose your purse.

00:01:13,927 --> 00:01:15,162
Mind if I take a look inside?

00:01:18,098 --> 00:01:22,069
You got some cash, a wallet
and some condoms.

00:01:22,069 --> 00:01:23,570
Well, safety first.

00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:26,139
No I.D. Debit card.

00:01:26,139 --> 00:01:27,874
Wait a minute. You don't look
like Keith Dobson.

00:01:27,874 --> 00:01:29,676
Yeah, it's not mine.

00:01:29,676 --> 00:01:32,045
Then what are you
doing with it?

00:01:32,045 --> 00:01:33,947
Have you been
arrested before?

00:01:33,947 --> 00:01:35,849
No. Never.

00:01:35,849 --> 00:01:37,918
Here's the deal.

00:01:37,918 --> 00:01:40,821
You start telling me the truth,
and maybe you get to go home.

00:01:40,821 --> 00:01:44,424
But if you keep lying to me,
you're going to jail.

00:01:50,897 --> 00:01:52,132
SIDLE:
I've never had

00:01:52,132 --> 00:01:53,567
to patrol the
streets like this.

00:01:53,567 --> 00:01:54,901
I mean, not even
when I was a CSI-1.

00:01:54,901 --> 00:01:57,037
It is a little crazy.

00:01:57,037 --> 00:01:58,905
Full moon tonight.

00:01:58,905 --> 00:02:01,074
You know, not
to discount the crazy,

00:02:01,074 --> 00:02:02,743
but no lunar effect

00:02:02,743 --> 00:02:04,645
on human behavior has
ever been established.

00:02:04,645 --> 00:02:06,513
What about horses?

00:02:06,513 --> 00:02:07,514
(groaning)

00:02:07,514 --> 00:02:09,516
Hey, Trigger.

00:02:09,516 --> 00:02:11,985
Wake up.

00:02:11,985 --> 00:02:13,120
Hello.

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,389
(groans)

00:02:15,389 --> 00:02:18,558
Well, this grass ain't hay.

00:02:18,558 --> 00:02:21,795
Trigger just bought himself
a night in the barn.

00:02:21,795 --> 00:02:24,631
Control, 3-0-5-Charlie.
Sergeant Weiss requesting

00:02:24,631 --> 00:02:25,799
transport van to our location.

00:02:25,799 --> 00:02:26,733
(groaning)

00:02:30,103 --> 00:02:31,538
(indistinct chatter)

00:02:31,538 --> 00:02:33,540
Hey, boys.

00:02:35,709 --> 00:02:37,110
(laughing):
What?

00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,512
Adrian. Hey, man.

00:02:38,512 --> 00:02:39,946
Hey.
How are sales?

00:02:39,946 --> 00:02:41,948
What did I say,
last time, huh?

00:02:41,948 --> 00:02:44,518
One more swing and miss--
that is strike three.

00:02:44,518 --> 00:02:45,585
That's life.

00:02:46,687 --> 00:02:48,121
What's your name, kid?

00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:51,792
I know you're scared, all right?

00:02:51,792 --> 00:02:53,527
Okay, here's the deal--
you work with me,

00:02:53,527 --> 00:02:54,561
maybe you
go home tonight.

00:02:54,561 --> 00:02:55,862
Just going to need you

00:02:55,862 --> 00:02:57,764
to come downtown
and make a statement, okay?

00:02:57,764 --> 00:02:59,733
We got a deal?

00:03:05,572 --> 00:03:08,041
(siren wails)

00:03:10,711 --> 00:03:12,713
MAN (over radio):
All units, 415-C.

00:03:12,713 --> 00:03:14,414
Olympia Casino.

00:03:14,414 --> 00:03:16,717
Suspect possibly armed.

00:03:16,717 --> 00:03:18,719
What are you all afraid of?

00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:22,556
Hey, hey, I want you all
to meet my dad.

00:03:22,556 --> 00:03:24,925
We got in a little fight.

00:03:24,925 --> 00:03:26,560
But, you know,
it's all good now.

00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,728
What's going on?

00:03:27,728 --> 00:03:28,895
Casino security called it in.

00:03:28,895 --> 00:03:30,831
A guy just showed up
swinging a head.

00:03:30,831 --> 00:03:33,533
Right, Pops?

00:03:33,533 --> 00:03:34,701
Doesn't look like he's armed.

00:03:34,701 --> 00:03:36,636
What are you
looking at?

00:03:36,636 --> 00:03:38,505
No, just dangerous. Officer, we
need to move these people back.

00:03:38,505 --> 00:03:41,908
LVPD. I'm going to have to ask
everyone to move back.

00:03:41,908 --> 00:03:43,777
Hey, sir, calm down.
Put the head on the ground.

00:03:43,777 --> 00:03:44,945
Step away.

00:03:44,945 --> 00:03:46,613
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

00:03:46,613 --> 00:03:49,015
The blood is on your
hands, not mine!

00:03:49,015 --> 00:03:50,183
I'm not doing
anything wrong.

00:03:50,183 --> 00:03:52,119
SIDLE:
Hey, hey, sir! Hey, sir,

00:03:52,119 --> 00:03:54,421
there's another casino
across the street.
Hey, hey.

00:03:54,421 --> 00:03:56,022
Dad, come back.

00:03:56,022 --> 00:03:57,724
Call for paramedics.
SIDLE:
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh.

00:03:57,724 --> 00:03:59,726
Hey, uh, guys,
the head is fake.

00:03:59,726 --> 00:04:01,394
Please tell me you're
getting this. This is awesome!

00:04:01,394 --> 00:04:02,996
Hey. It's a stunt.

00:04:02,996 --> 00:04:04,498
Yeah, that girl
in the blue hoodie!

00:04:04,498 --> 00:04:06,533
Grab her!
Hey, get back here!

00:04:07,868 --> 00:04:09,069
You, stop!

00:04:09,069 --> 00:04:11,138
Vegas PD.
Get over here!

00:04:11,138 --> 00:04:14,641
Running was bad,
but, dude, that hurts.

00:04:14,641 --> 00:04:16,943
Hurt's just beginning.
Joke's over, kid.

00:04:16,943 --> 00:04:18,879
I think you're going
to jail, dude.
Only adds to my fame

00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:21,148
when my video goes viral.
I'm gonna have more hits

00:04:21,148 --> 00:04:22,816
than that chick singing...
All right, you know what?

00:04:22,816 --> 00:04:23,850
That's enough of that.
Shut up.

00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:25,051
Come on, man.

00:04:25,051 --> 00:04:26,686
It's not like anybody died.

00:04:26,686 --> 00:04:27,988
CRAWFORD:
Get over here.

00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:32,425
CRAWFORD:
You got something?

00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,796
Looks like someone else
got punked tonight.

00:04:39,633 --> 00:04:41,968

RUSSELL:
You got an I.D.

00:05:30,016 --> 00:05:31,418
on our gunshot victim?

00:05:31,418 --> 00:05:33,186
No. No, not yet.
Wallet was missing.

00:05:33,186 --> 00:05:35,155
What about vehicle
registration?

00:05:35,155 --> 00:05:37,691
Well, it's a rental, but the
guy won't give up the name till

00:05:37,691 --> 00:05:40,126
he clears it with corporate,
so we're getting a warrant.

00:05:40,126 --> 00:05:42,596
Sara is processing
the car right now.

00:05:42,596 --> 00:05:44,664
Evidence says the shooter
was in the backseat.

00:05:44,664 --> 00:05:46,399
Sounds like a pop-and-rob.

00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:47,801
Well, unfortunately,

00:05:47,801 --> 00:05:49,436
traffic cam footage was a bust,

00:05:49,436 --> 00:05:51,905
so in the meantime,
I'll check in with the doc,

00:05:51,905 --> 00:05:53,406
see what he's
got to say.

00:05:53,406 --> 00:05:54,808
Good Lord.

00:05:54,808 --> 00:05:56,042
MAN:
<i>Dude,</i>

00:05:56,042 --> 00:05:57,644
I need my head back.
I rented it

00:05:57,644 --> 00:05:58,912
for the weekend.

00:05:58,912 --> 00:06:00,780
This guy
does special effects for TV.

00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,450
Very good, but very expensive.

00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:05,785
Sir, I need to confirm--
is this your vehicle?

00:06:08,788 --> 00:06:10,423
BRODY:
Feel like I'm back

00:06:10,423 --> 00:06:11,825
at the Hollywood Division.

00:06:11,825 --> 00:06:13,560
Where exactly
do you need me?

00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,528
Booking. Ask for Chastity.

00:06:15,528 --> 00:06:17,697
You'll know
when you see her.

00:06:17,697 --> 00:06:18,932
I'm on it.

00:06:18,932 --> 00:06:21,001
(garbled radio transmission)

00:06:21,001 --> 00:06:24,037
Hey, hey, hey, Crawford,
when do I get my phone call?!

00:06:24,037 --> 00:06:26,673
Hey!
Here's my statement.

00:06:26,673 --> 00:06:29,042
About buying drugs
off that dealer.

00:06:29,042 --> 00:06:30,176
Can I go now, Officer?

00:06:30,176 --> 00:06:31,745
You need to sign it.

00:06:31,745 --> 00:06:34,681
Ah.

00:06:34,681 --> 00:06:37,417
Here you go.

00:06:37,417 --> 00:06:40,453
Bobby Reed.

00:06:40,453 --> 00:06:42,188
Is your dad Dennis Reed?

00:06:42,188 --> 00:06:43,823
City attorney?

00:06:43,823 --> 00:06:46,459
Yeah. He's not going
to be too happy.

00:06:46,459 --> 00:06:48,128
Well, it could be worse.

00:06:48,128 --> 00:06:50,597
Next time,
I won't let you off so easy.

00:06:50,597 --> 00:06:52,999
You understand?

00:06:52,999 --> 00:06:55,168
WEISS:

00:06:55,168 --> 00:06:58,038

00:06:58,038 --> 00:07:00,740
Joslyn. You understand
why you're here?

00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,008
No.

00:07:02,008 --> 00:07:03,777
No, I... I do not.

00:07:03,777 --> 00:07:05,612
You took a swing
at a cab driver.

00:07:05,612 --> 00:07:07,647
He started it, and I wasn't
just protecting myself.

00:07:07,647 --> 00:07:09,449
I was protecting the life
of my unborn child.

00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:11,818
Have you been drinking tonight?

00:07:11,818 --> 00:07:13,653
Have you taken anything?

00:07:13,653 --> 00:07:16,623
I take offense. I'd never
endanger the health of my baby.

00:07:16,623 --> 00:07:18,591
How dare you!
Oh, hey.

00:07:18,591 --> 00:07:19,726
(overlapping chatter)

00:07:19,726 --> 00:07:21,728
Hey, I need
some help here!

00:07:21,728 --> 00:07:22,896
Somebody get the chair!

00:07:22,896 --> 00:07:24,030
Get your hands off of me!

Sit back.
Joslyn, calm down.

00:07:30,437 --> 00:07:32,639
What the hell is this thing?!
WEISS:
Joslyn, sit down.

00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,508
This is a violation!
I've been violated!

00:07:35,508 --> 00:07:37,510
If my water breaks,
it'll be on your head!

00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,678
Oh, you hear me?!

00:07:38,678 --> 00:07:42,515

Your head! Oh, no!

Take it easy.

WEISS:
Joslyn, take it easy.

00:07:44,951 --> 00:07:47,721
$2,300 in cash,
and a stolen debit card.

00:07:47,721 --> 00:07:48,989
Pretty good night, huh?

00:07:48,989 --> 00:07:51,391
I'm gonna need you
to take off your clothes

00:07:51,391 --> 00:07:54,127
and all of your
personal belongings.

00:07:54,127 --> 00:07:55,628
Jewelry, everything.

00:08:04,437 --> 00:08:07,073
I'm gonna need the ring, too.

00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,010
You'll get it back.

00:08:15,982 --> 00:08:18,451
(sighs)

00:08:26,092 --> 00:08:28,795
Mayans were right. World's
coming to an end next month.

00:08:28,795 --> 00:08:30,030
BRASS:
We should all be so lucky.

00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:31,765
Has Sheriff Liston
talked to you?

00:08:31,765 --> 00:08:33,466
Hmm? No. Why?

00:08:33,466 --> 00:08:35,502
Well, I wanted
to give you a heads-up.

00:08:35,502 --> 00:08:37,971
When I got shot,
the department gave me a medal.

00:08:37,971 --> 00:08:40,140
Uh-oh. What does the sheriff
want to give me?

00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,108
Her job.

00:08:42,108 --> 00:08:44,477
What? What are you
talking about?

00:08:44,477 --> 00:08:45,712
She's thinking of resigning,

00:08:45,712 --> 00:08:47,047
appointing you
as her replacement.

00:08:47,047 --> 00:08:48,715
Resigning? No, no, no.

00:08:48,715 --> 00:08:50,717
That's the worst thing
she could do right now.

00:08:50,717 --> 00:08:53,686
And-and I'm the last person
who should replace her.

00:08:53,686 --> 00:08:55,155
You should consider it.
Seriously.

00:08:55,155 --> 00:08:56,556
For the sake of the department.

00:08:56,556 --> 00:08:58,558
Look, Conrad,

00:08:58,558 --> 00:09:01,494
not everyone likes you,
but everyone respects you.

00:09:01,494 --> 00:09:03,897
And maybe more importantly,
they trust you.

00:09:03,897 --> 00:09:05,598
I'll admit, there was a time

00:09:05,598 --> 00:09:09,803
I would have jumped at
the opportunity, but now...

00:09:09,803 --> 00:09:12,739
I don't even know if I want to
be doing this job anymore, Jim.

00:09:12,739 --> 00:09:14,040
BRODY:
Captain,

00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,108
we need to talk.

00:09:17,677 --> 00:09:18,878
(camera shutter clicks
and beeps)

00:09:18,878 --> 00:09:21,147
How's your
head, Mr. Pak?

00:09:21,147 --> 00:09:22,615
It hurts.

00:09:22,615 --> 00:09:24,717
Oh, but you should see
the other guy.

00:09:24,717 --> 00:09:26,152
Well, the other head.

00:09:26,152 --> 00:09:28,421
Nice to see you still have
a sense of humor.

00:09:28,421 --> 00:09:29,589
Are you here
on vacation?

00:09:29,589 --> 00:09:31,091
Electronics convention.

00:09:31,091 --> 00:09:33,126
Hospital wasn't
on the itinerary.

00:09:33,126 --> 00:09:35,128
Those are some nasty-looking
hives on your hands.

00:09:35,128 --> 00:09:37,864
Oh, I'm sure it's nothing.

00:09:37,864 --> 00:09:41,935
Shellfish, allergy
to cigarette smoke, maybe.

00:09:41,935 --> 00:09:44,471
Surprised it's still legal
to smoke in casinos.

00:09:44,471 --> 00:09:46,439
You can get away with
a lot in this town.

00:09:46,439 --> 00:09:47,941
Yeah, like assault
with a fake bloody head.

00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:52,412
Head was fake.

00:09:52,412 --> 00:09:54,481
Blood's another story.

00:09:54,481 --> 00:09:55,882
The blood was... real?

00:09:55,882 --> 00:09:58,651
Could you give me a minute?

00:09:58,651 --> 00:10:01,921
(touch tones sounding)

00:10:01,921 --> 00:10:03,756
Hey, Greg, are you still talking

00:10:03,756 --> 00:10:05,492
to our prankster?

00:10:05,492 --> 00:10:07,494
Yeah, I'm sitting right
across from him. Why?

00:10:07,494 --> 00:10:10,730
Hematrace on the blood
from his fake head says that

00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:12,599
it's real, nonhuman.

00:10:12,599 --> 00:10:14,767
I need to know what it is.

00:10:14,767 --> 00:10:18,905
Hold on. Blood from your prop
head's positive for nonhuman.

00:10:18,905 --> 00:10:20,540
Nonhuman?

00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,642
You make it sound like
I used alien blood.

00:10:22,642 --> 00:10:24,777
It's pig's blood.
Old-school horror movie, dude.

00:10:24,777 --> 00:10:26,613
Like any zombie movie.

00:10:26,613 --> 00:10:28,948
Tarantino here says
it's pig's blood.

00:10:28,948 --> 00:10:30,650
Ugh. That's what
I was afraid of.

00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:32,619
The guy he clocked
is having a reaction.

00:10:32,619 --> 00:10:35,555
Could be viral.
Maybe a blood-born pathogen.

00:10:35,555 --> 00:10:37,423
Oh, great.
FINLAY:
Yeah, we need to know

00:10:37,423 --> 00:10:38,791
exactly where he went
on the Strip

00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:40,793
and how many people
he came in contact with.

00:10:40,793 --> 00:10:42,629
Got it.

00:10:42,629 --> 00:10:44,931
Well, it looks like your
wish might have come true.

00:10:44,931 --> 00:10:46,699
You went viral.

00:10:46,699 --> 00:10:48,134
Awesome!

00:10:48,134 --> 00:10:50,637
(whoops)
As in outbreak.

00:10:50,637 --> 00:10:53,039
Your pig's blood may
have been tainted.

00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:54,507
What are you
talking about, dude?

00:10:54,507 --> 00:10:55,909
I'm feeling fine.

00:10:55,909 --> 00:10:58,077
All right, dude, you are
going to draw me a map.

00:10:58,077 --> 00:10:59,746
Everywhere you went.

00:10:59,746 --> 00:11:01,614
And you had better find
your girlfriend with the camera.

00:11:01,614 --> 00:11:03,950
I'm gonna go find you
another shirt so you don't

00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:05,418
contaminate anyone else.

00:11:05,418 --> 00:11:06,486
You stay here,

00:11:06,486 --> 00:11:08,388
don't touch anything.

00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:13,159
SIDLE:
Your gunshot victim's stippling
indicates close range.

00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:15,595
Dead center, back of the head.

00:11:15,595 --> 00:11:17,463
Victim never even
turned around.

00:11:17,463 --> 00:11:20,567
Tells me the shooter was quick
and efficient, a professional.

00:11:20,567 --> 00:11:23,403
Or the shooter was someone
that the victim knew.

00:11:23,403 --> 00:11:24,437
Or thought

00:11:24,437 --> 00:11:25,738
he knew.

00:11:25,738 --> 00:11:27,874
Doc pulled a .22-caliber
slug out of his head.

00:11:27,874 --> 00:11:29,809
Come take a look
at this.

00:11:32,111 --> 00:11:33,580
There's no rifling.

00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,114
Hmm, weird, right?

00:11:35,114 --> 00:11:37,984
Yeah, usually see this
when someone drills out

00:11:37,984 --> 00:11:40,453
the barrel of a gun to
make it harder to identify.

00:11:40,453 --> 00:11:41,988
Yeah, but that kind
of modification

00:11:41,988 --> 00:11:43,923
would still leaves marks
on the bullet

00:11:43,923 --> 00:11:45,425
as it rattled
down the barrel.

00:11:45,425 --> 00:11:46,826
Yeah, there's
no sign of that

00:11:46,826 --> 00:11:49,095
on this bullet.
No.

00:11:49,095 --> 00:11:52,398
So...I'm thinking
the shooter used

00:11:52,398 --> 00:11:54,133
a sub-caliber device.

00:11:54,133 --> 00:11:55,602
Adapting a larger
caliber weapon

00:11:55,602 --> 00:11:57,737
to fire a smaller
caliber bullet,

00:11:57,737 --> 00:12:02,008
<i>like using a .44 to fire a .22.</i>

00:12:03,776 --> 00:12:06,746
I'll get it to Hodges,
see if he can identify trace

00:12:06,746 --> 00:12:08,581
from a sub-caliber device.

00:12:08,581 --> 00:12:10,950
Maybe we'll be able to tie
the bullet to the murder weapon.

00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:13,753
Got to find the gun first.

00:12:13,753 --> 00:12:15,855
Stop pushing me, I said.

00:12:15,855 --> 00:12:18,558
Sit down.

00:12:18,558 --> 00:12:20,426
I ran your
prints, Chastity.

00:12:20,426 --> 00:12:21,961
Your real name is
Heather Tile, you're 19.

00:12:21,961 --> 00:12:24,597
You're from Butler,
Pennsylvania.

00:12:24,597 --> 00:12:27,100
You have prior arrests
in Los Angeles and Nevada

00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,668
for prostitution and larceny.

00:12:28,668 --> 00:12:30,136
Look, I can explain
that debit card.

00:12:30,136 --> 00:12:31,738
I asked a friend...
Forget about
the debit card.

00:12:31,738 --> 00:12:32,739
We'll talk about
that later.

00:12:34,474 --> 00:12:37,510
Now, here's what
I want to ask you.

00:12:38,745 --> 00:12:41,714
Where'd you
get this ring?

00:12:41,714 --> 00:12:44,584
What do you mean,
where I got that ring?

00:12:44,584 --> 00:12:45,752
That's mine.

00:12:45,752 --> 00:12:46,853
No, it's not yours.

00:12:46,853 --> 00:12:48,588
It is mine.
No, it's not.

00:12:48,588 --> 00:12:50,957
You know how I know?

00:12:50,957 --> 00:12:52,425
The inscription.

00:12:52,425 --> 00:12:54,427
See, I had
that ring made

00:12:54,427 --> 00:12:56,095
for my ex-wife.

00:12:56,095 --> 00:12:57,897
That's her
engagement ring.

00:12:57,897 --> 00:12:59,699
So I'm going to
ask you again,

00:12:59,699 --> 00:13:00,767
where'd you get the ring?

00:13:00,767 --> 00:13:01,768
I already told you,

00:13:01,768 --> 00:13:04,971
I bought it for,
like, 200 bucks.

00:13:04,971 --> 00:13:06,673
From who?

00:13:06,673 --> 00:13:09,108
This girl--
we worked the streets together.

00:13:09,108 --> 00:13:10,777
What's her name?
I don't know.

00:13:10,777 --> 00:13:12,712
We call her Jersey
on the street.

00:13:14,981 --> 00:13:17,650
Let me show
you something.

00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:18,685
Tell me...

00:13:20,486 --> 00:13:21,888
...does that look like her?

00:13:21,888 --> 00:13:24,791
Mm-hmm, yeah.

00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:26,025
That's the girl.

00:13:29,062 --> 00:13:31,764
Oh, man. That's my daughter.

00:13:34,467 --> 00:13:36,469
JOSLYN:
It's coming.

00:13:36,469 --> 00:13:38,604
It's coming,
it's coming.

00:13:38,604 --> 00:13:39,972
My baby is coming.

00:13:39,972 --> 00:13:41,841
Oh, my water broke.

00:13:41,841 --> 00:13:42,842
Oh,

00:13:42,842 --> 00:13:43,943
I'm out of time.
Joslyn,

00:13:43,943 --> 00:13:45,578
remember, we agreed,

00:13:45,578 --> 00:13:47,113
if I let you out of the
chair, you were going

00:13:47,113 --> 00:13:48,981
to cooperate
and be calm.
Please,

00:13:48,981 --> 00:13:50,550
I'm bursting.

00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:52,418
Joslyn, please, we are
trying to help you.

00:13:52,418 --> 00:13:54,454
The paramedics are here.
They just want to take you

00:13:54,454 --> 00:13:55,888
to the hospital,
make sure you're okay.

00:13:55,888 --> 00:13:57,056
Yeah, to make sure
your baby

00:13:57,056 --> 00:13:58,791
is okay.

00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:00,526
My baby is coming.
I'm not going to any hospital.

00:14:00,526 --> 00:14:02,095
I'm having my baby here!

00:14:02,095 --> 00:14:05,565
I'm having my baby now.
Joslyn, just calm down.

00:14:05,565 --> 00:14:09,001
(screaming)

00:14:12,572 --> 00:14:14,173
Get her down.
Get her down!

00:14:14,173 --> 00:14:15,942
Get her down!

00:14:20,713 --> 00:14:23,182
(shouting indistinctly)

00:14:23,182 --> 00:14:25,118
Help me, help me with my baby.

00:14:30,857 --> 00:14:32,992
Looks like a war zone.

00:14:32,992 --> 00:14:34,460
Yeah, war at home.

00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,895
One casualty.

00:14:35,895 --> 00:14:37,497
Hospital said

00:14:37,497 --> 00:14:40,767
our pregnant
transvestite was DOA.

00:14:40,767 --> 00:14:43,102
Internal Affairs
is going to be all over that.

00:14:43,102 --> 00:14:44,604
Sergeant Weiss
follow procedure?

00:14:44,604 --> 00:14:46,172
As far as I know.

00:14:46,172 --> 00:14:48,641
Doesn't mean they won't be
looking for a scapegoat.

00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:52,445
Quite a busy night
on the Strip, Marko.

00:14:52,445 --> 00:14:53,546
So where did you go

00:14:53,546 --> 00:14:55,148
after the Fashion Arcade?

00:14:55,148 --> 00:14:57,884
Uh, I went to
the Olympia.

00:14:57,884 --> 00:14:59,619
Oh, hey, Lydia, it's me.

00:14:59,619 --> 00:15:01,020
So, I'm here
with the cops.

00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,655
They think maybe our
pig's blood spread

00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,524
some, like, Ebola

00:15:04,524 --> 00:15:06,092
or flu or something.

00:15:06,092 --> 00:15:07,994
Anyway, I need the camera
'cause they want to see

00:15:07,994 --> 00:15:09,662
who we messed with,
so call me back.

00:15:09,662 --> 00:15:12,765
Like, right away.

00:15:12,765 --> 00:15:14,133
(phone rings)

00:15:14,133 --> 00:15:15,902
Hey, Finn, if you're still
at the hospital,

00:15:15,902 --> 00:15:17,103
I hope you're in quarantine

00:15:17,103 --> 00:15:18,571
because you do not want
to be here.

00:15:18,571 --> 00:15:20,139
I'm actually not in quarantine.

00:15:20,139 --> 00:15:22,675
The hospital tested
the pig's blood, and there is

00:15:22,675 --> 00:15:25,678
no sign of any virus
or pathogen,

00:15:25,678 --> 00:15:27,580
and Mr. Pak's responded
well to treatment,

00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,648
so he's on
his way home.

00:15:28,648 --> 00:15:29,649
So outbreak averted.

00:15:29,649 --> 00:15:30,883
Yes.

00:15:30,883 --> 00:15:32,151
I am headed back to the lab.
Yeah.

00:15:32,151 --> 00:15:33,586
I'll see you soon.

00:15:33,586 --> 00:15:34,754
All right, bye.

00:15:34,754 --> 00:15:36,789
Told you everything
was cool.

00:15:36,789 --> 00:15:38,691
Everything is not cool.

00:15:38,691 --> 00:15:39,892
What is this?

00:15:39,892 --> 00:15:41,160
This is a map

00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,663
of our prankster's trip
down the Strip.

00:15:43,663 --> 00:15:45,465
Passing right by
our John Doe homicide.

00:15:45,465 --> 00:15:46,766
Dude, I didn't
see anything.

00:15:46,766 --> 00:15:48,568
What about your girlfriend
with the camera?

00:15:48,568 --> 00:15:49,936
She was too busy shooting.

00:15:49,936 --> 00:15:51,571
Video.

00:15:51,571 --> 00:15:52,872
So maybe the camera
is our witness.

00:15:52,872 --> 00:15:54,474
Yeah, where is it?

00:15:54,474 --> 00:15:55,975
Lydia has it.
She's not calling me back.

00:15:55,975 --> 00:15:58,444
Well, you'd better
make up with her soon

00:15:58,444 --> 00:16:01,581
because that camera is evidence
in a homicide investigation now.

00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:04,984
Hey.

00:16:04,984 --> 00:16:06,719
So I ran

00:16:06,719 --> 00:16:08,788
the stolen debit card that
we got off of Chastity,

00:16:08,788 --> 00:16:09,922
and guess what.

00:16:09,922 --> 00:16:11,591
It was used to
rent the car

00:16:11,591 --> 00:16:13,593
that Nick found our
gunshot victim in.

00:16:13,593 --> 00:16:15,094
Did you get
the driver's license?
Yep.

00:16:15,094 --> 00:16:16,596
Keith Dobson.

00:16:16,596 --> 00:16:18,097
Name matches the one
on the debit card,

00:16:18,097 --> 00:16:20,099
and the photo matches
our dead guy.

00:16:20,099 --> 00:16:24,470
So Keith Dobson
is our John Doe...

00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:25,738
and Chastity is upgraded

00:16:25,738 --> 00:16:26,873
from trick roll
to murder.

00:16:26,873 --> 00:16:28,174
Sara says
the prankster

00:16:28,174 --> 00:16:29,942
may have footage
of the crime.

00:16:29,942 --> 00:16:31,978
Now we may have
a suspect,

00:16:31,978 --> 00:16:34,580
although I'm not so sure
she did it all on her own.

00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,115
Maybe she had a partner.

00:16:45,558 --> 00:16:46,826
Hey.
Hey.

00:16:46,826 --> 00:16:48,761
Um,

00:16:48,761 --> 00:16:52,131
what you said before about not
wanting to do this anymore--

00:16:52,131 --> 00:16:53,566
did you mean that?

00:16:53,566 --> 00:16:55,067
I'm sorry you
overheard that.

00:16:55,067 --> 00:16:56,636
I don't know what I'm
thinking right now,

00:16:56,636 --> 00:16:58,004
and right now is not a
good time to discuss it.

00:16:58,004 --> 00:16:59,572
Okay?

00:16:59,572 --> 00:17:03,409
Okay, but, you know,
whenever you're ready,

00:17:03,409 --> 00:17:04,777
you know where
you can find me.

00:17:04,777 --> 00:17:07,013
Okay.

00:17:07,013 --> 00:17:08,814
CHASTITY:
<i>I really did buy that ring,</i>

00:17:08,814 --> 00:17:10,182
you know,
and I'm willing

00:17:10,182 --> 00:17:12,051
to return it
as long as you cut me

00:17:12,051 --> 00:17:13,886
a deal
on that debit card.

00:17:15,187 --> 00:17:17,156
So you want
to negotiate?

00:17:17,156 --> 00:17:19,625
Okay, let's
negotiate.

00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:22,161
You know who this is, right?

00:17:22,161 --> 00:17:24,764
That's good.

00:17:24,764 --> 00:17:26,499
Now, I want you
to take your time

00:17:26,499 --> 00:17:28,634
because the next answer
you give is going to decide

00:17:28,634 --> 00:17:31,137
whether you spend 25
years to life in prison.

00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,676
I don't know nothing
about that, man.

00:17:36,676 --> 00:17:38,744
Okay, what do you know?

00:17:38,744 --> 00:17:41,547
I met him at the pool
at the Tangiers.

00:17:41,547 --> 00:17:44,817
Him and his buddy--
they...they wanted company.

00:17:44,817 --> 00:17:46,919
And you--who did you go with?

00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:48,888
No one--it was just me.

00:17:48,888 --> 00:17:50,790
They didn't seem to mind.

00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,658
What?
Don't give me that look.

00:17:52,658 --> 00:17:54,026
I'm telling you
the truth, all right?

00:17:54,026 --> 00:17:55,394
We'll see.

00:17:55,394 --> 00:17:56,796
How'd you get
that debit card?

00:17:56,796 --> 00:17:58,164
I spent the day
with them

00:17:58,164 --> 00:17:59,899
at their suite,

00:17:59,899 --> 00:18:01,534
showed them a good time,
you know.

00:18:01,534 --> 00:18:05,071
The debit card guy
was clueless.

00:18:05,071 --> 00:18:07,139
The other guy
was more of a player.

00:18:07,139 --> 00:18:08,708
Seemed like a local.

00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:10,443
Kind of like that cartoon,
you know,

00:18:10,443 --> 00:18:13,412
like the Country Mouse,
the City Mouse, I don't know.

00:18:14,847 --> 00:18:16,749
Except, in this cartoon,
the Country Mouse gets

00:18:16,749 --> 00:18:18,184
a bullet in the
back of his head.

00:18:19,452 --> 00:18:21,520
Look, I-I stole

00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,823
the card from the guy
while he was in the shower.

00:18:23,823 --> 00:18:26,058
Then he and his buddy--
they wanted to hit the Strip,

00:18:26,058 --> 00:18:28,527
so I left them
at the valet stand.

00:18:28,527 --> 00:18:30,696
I'm telling you
the truth, I swear.

00:18:30,696 --> 00:18:33,699
The dead guy's friend--
what did he look like?

00:18:33,699 --> 00:18:35,067
Not much different--

00:18:35,067 --> 00:18:38,804
just another college boy
getting off on the Strip.

00:18:42,108 --> 00:18:44,810
ROBBINS:
Subject is

00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:47,179
a male Caucasian, 27.

00:18:47,179 --> 00:18:49,715
Cause of death is exsanguination

00:18:49,715 --> 00:18:51,684
due to multiple
sharp force injuries

00:18:51,684 --> 00:18:54,120
severing
the external iliac artery.

00:18:55,721 --> 00:18:57,790
Greg, you okay?

00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:00,626
Yeah, I...I just thought
he was high.

00:19:00,626 --> 00:19:02,995
I never imagined he would do
anything like this.

00:19:02,995 --> 00:19:05,464
We all have our own demons.

00:19:05,464 --> 00:19:08,668
Drugs only weaken our ability
to confront them.

00:19:08,668 --> 00:19:10,603
Whatever delusions
he was suffering from,

00:19:10,603 --> 00:19:13,139
clearly they got
the best of him.

00:19:13,139 --> 00:19:16,142
He may not have been
as delusional as you think.

00:19:16,142 --> 00:19:17,943
What do you mean?

00:19:17,943 --> 00:19:20,946
According to the abdominal
X-rays, Joslyn was pregnant--

00:19:20,946 --> 00:19:22,682
not with a baby,

00:19:22,682 --> 00:19:27,186
but, uh, definitely
with bundles of joy.

00:19:33,959 --> 00:19:36,862
SANDERS:
He was smuggling drugs.

00:19:36,862 --> 00:19:40,499
And like him,
not all the product survived.

00:19:40,499 --> 00:19:42,968
No wonder he had
a psychotic break.

00:19:42,968 --> 00:19:44,870
Wanted to cut
the baby out.

00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:45,971
There must be
at least 20 balloons

00:19:45,971 --> 00:19:47,139
left inside his stomach.

00:19:47,139 --> 00:19:48,908
SANDERS:
I'll get them to Tox.

00:19:48,908 --> 00:19:51,177
If we can identify this drug,
maybe we can figure out

00:19:51,177 --> 00:19:52,878
who he was
muling for.

00:19:52,878 --> 00:19:55,448
They did this to him.

00:19:55,448 --> 00:19:56,649
HODGES:
I put our bullet

00:19:56,649 --> 00:19:58,451
under electron microscope
magnification.

00:19:58,451 --> 00:19:59,885
STOKES:
Well, whatever it is,

00:19:59,885 --> 00:20:02,588
it looks like it's scorched
right onto the bullet.

00:20:02,588 --> 00:20:05,558
It is, and if you
take a closer look,

00:20:05,558 --> 00:20:07,460
you can see
the face of Jesus.

00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,994
Come on, man, it's been
a long night, dude.

00:20:08,994 --> 00:20:11,964
Fine, be a
secular humanist.

00:20:11,964 --> 00:20:13,165
What you're
looking at is

00:20:13,165 --> 00:20:14,900
a composite material--

00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,669
unpolymerized resin
and calcium carbide.

00:20:16,669 --> 00:20:17,670
Trace left

00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:19,939
by a sub-caliber device?

00:20:19,939 --> 00:20:22,675
Could be, except that
sub-caliber devices

00:20:22,675 --> 00:20:25,111
are made of brass or
steel, not polymer.

00:20:25,111 --> 00:20:27,046
Well, maybe the killer
is using plastics.

00:20:27,046 --> 00:20:29,949
Maybe even an
entirely plastic gun.

00:20:29,949 --> 00:20:31,150
Think about it.

00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:33,419
Virtually
undetectable, perfect

00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:35,087
for a robber
working the Strip.

00:20:35,087 --> 00:20:36,756
John Malkovich--
<i>In the Line of Fire--</i>

00:20:36,756 --> 00:20:38,758
made a gun entirely
out of polymer.

00:20:38,758 --> 00:20:41,060
Good movie, bad science.

00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,762
A polymer gun
can't stand up

00:20:42,762 --> 00:20:44,063
to the pressure
of firing a bullet.

00:20:44,063 --> 00:20:45,698
It would break down.

00:20:45,698 --> 00:20:47,900
Okay, what if you only
needed to fire it once?

00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,068
One shot, one kill.

00:20:49,068 --> 00:20:50,669
Is that another movie?

00:20:50,669 --> 00:20:52,171
It will be,
starring my theory,

00:20:52,171 --> 00:20:53,939
coming to a
lab near you.

00:20:53,939 --> 00:20:56,976
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have some work to do.

00:20:56,976 --> 00:20:59,545
Who would play you?

00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,015
Hmm.

00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:07,853
Hey, Greg, I ran those
balloons Doc pulled

00:21:07,853 --> 00:21:09,121
off your pregnant
transvestite.

00:21:09,121 --> 00:21:10,556
Yeah.

00:21:10,556 --> 00:21:12,158
Drugs were a cocktail
of oxycodone,

00:21:12,158 --> 00:21:13,893
fentanyl and meperidine.

00:21:13,893 --> 00:21:17,496
That's prescription, not
your typical drug-mule fare.

00:21:17,496 --> 00:21:19,632
No, but already on
the menu tonight.

00:21:19,632 --> 00:21:20,933
What do you mean?

00:21:20,933 --> 00:21:22,168
A few hours ago, Nick
and Officer Crawford

00:21:22,168 --> 00:21:23,602
busted a dealer
on the Strip--

00:21:23,602 --> 00:21:24,870
Adrian Dinan.

00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:26,639
They took a baggie
of powder off him.

00:21:26,639 --> 00:21:28,007
The drugs the dealer
was selling have

00:21:28,007 --> 00:21:29,942
a chemical
composition identical

00:21:29,942 --> 00:21:31,610
to the drugs in your
victim's stomach.

00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:32,711
Same drugs.

00:21:32,711 --> 00:21:34,680
Means Joslyn
was smuggling

00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,916
for the same scumbag
who has Dinan

00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:38,184
out there selling
on the street.

00:21:38,184 --> 00:21:39,185
Looks like it.

00:21:39,185 --> 00:21:40,686
Thanks, Henry.

00:21:40,686 --> 00:21:41,921
You found the connection
I was looking for.

00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:47,493
ADRIAN (whistles):
These are some nasty photos.

00:21:47,493 --> 00:21:48,694
SANDERS:
Nasty business,

00:21:48,694 --> 00:21:50,663
smuggling drugs
for you and your boss.

00:21:50,663 --> 00:21:52,631
We know who you work for,
Adrian--

00:21:52,631 --> 00:21:55,134
Rolan Zahl, Mad-10's set leader.

00:21:55,134 --> 00:21:56,135
He runs girls

00:21:56,135 --> 00:21:58,871
and drugs
along the Strip.

00:21:58,871 --> 00:22:01,740
Sorry, I'm an
independent contractor.

00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,742
You want to stick
to that story?

00:22:03,742 --> 00:22:05,611
'Cause the drugs
you're selling

00:22:05,611 --> 00:22:07,179
tie you to this.

00:22:07,179 --> 00:22:09,081
Felony homicide.

00:22:09,081 --> 00:22:10,616
Forget about three strikes.

00:22:10,616 --> 00:22:12,751
I mean, we go
for "special circs,"

00:22:12,751 --> 00:22:14,119
you get the needle.

00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:17,823
I know you like
to "make deals," Crawford,

00:22:17,823 --> 00:22:19,091
but it's my turn.

00:22:19,091 --> 00:22:21,026
What the hell
are you talking about?

00:22:21,026 --> 00:22:24,163
Crawford here collared
the wrong drug dealer.

00:22:24,163 --> 00:22:26,732
That's BS. Adrian,
I caught you selling.

00:22:26,732 --> 00:22:28,868
Not selling; sampling.

00:22:28,868 --> 00:22:30,002
The white boy

00:22:30,002 --> 00:22:31,937
that he let go...

00:22:33,505 --> 00:22:35,574
His name is Bobby Reed.
He's a rich kid.

00:22:35,574 --> 00:22:38,177
His daddy's some big shot
lawyer for the city.

00:22:38,177 --> 00:22:40,646
He's been moving drugs in clubs

00:22:40,646 --> 00:22:41,981
on the Strip.

00:22:41,981 --> 00:22:44,516
Good business
plan because

00:22:44,516 --> 00:22:46,552
he and his friends
don't look like drug dealers.

00:22:46,552 --> 00:22:49,154
But there's only...one problem.

00:22:49,154 --> 00:22:50,723
Zahl.

00:22:50,723 --> 00:22:52,925
And I imagine
he doesn't like people...

00:22:52,925 --> 00:22:54,526
cutting into his profits.

00:22:54,526 --> 00:22:56,428
Which is where the
sampling comes in.

00:22:56,428 --> 00:22:58,697
Bobby approached me
with his product.

00:22:58,697 --> 00:23:02,501
Wanted to set up
a meeting with Zahl.

00:23:02,501 --> 00:23:03,936
Thought that going
into business together

00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:07,039
was preferable
to the alternative.

00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:09,108
Let's say we believe you.

00:23:09,108 --> 00:23:11,577
Where do we find Bobby Reed?

00:23:13,078 --> 00:23:15,614
You want me to help you
with your case,

00:23:15,614 --> 00:23:18,717
you need to help me with mine.

00:23:20,486 --> 00:23:21,820
Hey, babe. Finally.
I've been leaving messages

00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:23,055
for you all night.
I thought we agreed,

00:23:23,055 --> 00:23:24,890
when you freeze me out
like this,

00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:26,792
it's not healthy
for our relationship...
Marko, Marko,

00:23:26,792 --> 00:23:28,627
that's not helpful.
Right.

00:23:28,627 --> 00:23:30,629
Listen, I need
to put you on speaker.

00:23:30,629 --> 00:23:31,764
Do not put me on speaker.

00:23:31,764 --> 00:23:33,399
Too late.

00:23:33,399 --> 00:23:35,401
Sorry. Listen, I'm here
with Detective Siegel.

00:23:35,401 --> 00:23:37,536
The cops really
need the camera, okay?

00:23:37,536 --> 00:23:39,138
Marko, I'm going to hang up.
BOTH: Don't hang up!

00:23:39,138 --> 00:23:43,008
Uh, Ms. Kasper...
It's-it's Lydia, right?

00:23:44,777 --> 00:23:45,778
Who's this?

00:23:45,778 --> 00:23:46,879
Uh, I'm Sara <i>Sidle.</i>

00:23:46,879 --> 00:23:48,781
Uh, I'm with the crime lab,

00:23:48,781 --> 00:23:51,483
and I'm sure that you don't want
anything to do with this,

00:23:51,483 --> 00:23:53,719
but in all honesty,
a man was murdered tonight,

00:23:53,719 --> 00:23:58,390
and your camera may be the key
to finding out who did it.

00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:00,392
We really need your help.

00:24:00,392 --> 00:24:02,027
You're right. I don't want
anything to do with this.

00:24:02,027 --> 00:24:03,028
Okay, w-well, you don't have to.

00:24:03,028 --> 00:24:04,897
Uh, all I need you to do is

00:24:04,897 --> 00:24:07,566
drop the camera someplace
where I could find it.

00:24:07,566 --> 00:24:11,403
Could you... do that
for me, please?

00:24:11,403 --> 00:24:13,038
Where?
Okay,

00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:15,507
uh, behind the Olympia Casino,

00:24:15,507 --> 00:24:19,111
there's an alley with a Dumpster
for newspaper recycling.

00:24:19,111 --> 00:24:21,113
You can dump it in there.

00:24:21,113 --> 00:24:23,415
Okay. Marko, you still there?

00:24:23,415 --> 00:24:24,850
Yeah, babe, I'm here.

00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:27,586
I'm dumping you, too.
(beep)

00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:34,626
MAN:
All right, ladies,

00:24:34,626 --> 00:24:36,628
I'm going to ask you
to step over here.

00:24:36,628 --> 00:24:38,564
Hey. You find anything yet?

00:24:38,564 --> 00:24:40,099
No, nothing.

00:24:40,099 --> 00:24:42,101
I swear, why do I trust people?

00:24:42,101 --> 00:24:43,736
This job should've
beat it out of us

00:24:43,736 --> 00:24:44,937
by now.

00:24:47,806 --> 00:24:49,641
Wait.

00:24:49,641 --> 00:24:50,743
Sometimes life

00:24:50,743 --> 00:24:54,013
does offer up a surprise.

00:24:55,414 --> 00:24:57,416
"M.P." Marko Palmisano.

00:24:57,416 --> 00:24:59,852
All right.

00:25:05,791 --> 00:25:07,159
Got blood drops.

00:25:07,159 --> 00:25:09,128
What?
And some drag marks.

00:25:12,031 --> 00:25:14,566
Looks like a struggle.

00:25:18,003 --> 00:25:19,605
SIDLE:
Blue hoodie.

00:25:19,605 --> 00:25:21,840
Oh, my God, it's Lydia.

00:25:25,511 --> 00:25:27,446
Killer must've been looking
for this camera, too.

00:25:28,714 --> 00:25:30,783
Instead of finding it,
found her.

00:25:36,455 --> 00:25:38,490
This is my fault.

00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:41,493
Whoever did this to Lydia
did this because of me.

00:25:41,493 --> 00:25:44,696
Marko, this is not
your fault. It's not.

00:25:44,696 --> 00:25:47,466
It's because of the camera.

00:25:47,466 --> 00:25:49,868
I'm so sorry this happened,
and I promise you that

00:25:49,868 --> 00:25:51,637
we'll find the person
that did this.

00:25:54,506 --> 00:25:56,442
I'm sorry.

00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,816
(sighs)

00:26:09,888 --> 00:26:11,590
Got to feel for the guy.

00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:12,624
Hope he can forgive himself.

00:26:13,892 --> 00:26:15,394
I recovered this
from your victim.

00:26:15,394 --> 00:26:16,795
(sighs)

00:26:16,795 --> 00:26:18,597
SIDLE:
Looks like a .22.

00:26:18,597 --> 00:26:20,165
Same caliber as the bullet

00:26:20,165 --> 00:26:23,068
that killed our gunshot vic
in the car, Keith Dobson.

00:26:23,068 --> 00:26:25,070
Identical wound--
single round perfectly placed

00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:27,072
at the base of the skull.

00:26:27,072 --> 00:26:30,976
Same caliber, same M.O.,
same killer.

00:26:30,976 --> 00:26:33,679
Hey! I want you all

00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:36,081
to meet my dad!

00:26:36,081 --> 00:26:37,850
So, did you find anything
on the video?

00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:40,452
I did. I found
our crime scene.

00:26:40,452 --> 00:26:41,587
Keith Dobson's

00:26:41,587 --> 00:26:43,655
rental car,
and he has company.

00:26:43,655 --> 00:26:45,591
Yeah, hold it
right there.

00:26:46,658 --> 00:26:47,960
Chastity.

00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,962
It's a hooker we busted
on the Strip,

00:26:49,962 --> 00:26:51,830
had Keith Dobson's debit card.

00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:55,501
Well, she told Brass that
she left Dobson and a buddy

00:26:55,501 --> 00:26:57,970
at the valet stand
at the Tangiers.

00:26:57,970 --> 00:26:59,671
Hard to believe
that a hooker would lie.

00:26:59,671 --> 00:27:02,174
Yeah. So what about
this "buddy"?

00:27:02,174 --> 00:27:03,976
Caught him on tape.

00:27:03,976 --> 00:27:06,645
Ah, there he is--
in the backseat,

00:27:06,645 --> 00:27:07,846
right behind
Keith Dobson.

00:27:07,846 --> 00:27:10,616
Bobby Reed.
That's the kid

00:27:10,616 --> 00:27:12,417
we let go--we thought
he was buying drugs,

00:27:12,417 --> 00:27:13,919
dealer said
he was selling.

00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,388
Well, I think he may be
guilty of more than that.

00:27:16,388 --> 00:27:18,857
Sadly, we don't have
the smoking gun on tape.

00:27:18,857 --> 00:27:21,026
Thanks to Mini-Me
in the Mini.

00:27:21,026 --> 00:27:23,695
There's a bit
of a jumble here.

00:27:23,695 --> 00:27:26,398
There... it is.

00:27:26,398 --> 00:27:28,000
Bobby Reed and Chastity

00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,735
high-tailing it away
from the car.

00:27:29,735 --> 00:27:31,103
Leaving Keith
at the wheel.

00:27:31,103 --> 00:27:32,104
Yeah, not moving.

00:27:32,104 --> 00:27:34,473
Just like you found him.

00:27:34,473 --> 00:27:36,108
CHASTITY:
It's not what it looks like.

00:27:36,108 --> 00:27:38,477
BRASS:
Well, what is it, then?
You know, I'm trying

00:27:38,477 --> 00:27:39,611
to be a good guy,
you know,

00:27:39,611 --> 00:27:41,647
but all I get
from you is lies.

00:27:41,647 --> 00:27:42,848
You're gonna
tell me the truth,

00:27:42,848 --> 00:27:43,849
or I'm throwing you

00:27:43,849 --> 00:27:45,450
to the wolves,
so you got

00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:47,419
about five seconds to tell me.

00:27:47,419 --> 00:27:48,754
I am telling you
the truth, okay?

00:27:48,754 --> 00:27:50,155
I had nothing to do
with that murder.

00:27:50,155 --> 00:27:51,790
I met them for the first time

00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:54,092
at the Tangiers.
Okay, we're done here.

00:27:55,394 --> 00:27:57,529
On orders from Rolan Zahl.

00:27:59,031 --> 00:28:01,033
Rolan Zahl?

00:28:01,033 --> 00:28:03,168
The Mad-10's
set leader?

00:28:03,168 --> 00:28:04,970
Huh?

00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:07,573
Yeah. I work for him.
You mean he's your pimp.

00:28:07,573 --> 00:28:11,043
He asked me to pick up
on Bobby Reed, so I did.

00:28:11,043 --> 00:28:13,645
His buddy just came along
for the ride.

00:28:13,645 --> 00:28:15,180
He told me to...

00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,949
hang out with Bobby
and text him,

00:28:16,949 --> 00:28:18,650
let him know
where we were.

00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:20,919
So Rolan Zahl had you
keeping tabs on Bobby Reed?

00:28:20,919 --> 00:28:23,055
He said he just wanted
to talk to the guy.

00:28:23,055 --> 00:28:24,122
"Talk"?
Yeah, talk,

00:28:24,122 --> 00:28:25,924
like, with a gun
to his head. Look,

00:28:25,924 --> 00:28:27,492
what I don't understand is...

00:28:27,492 --> 00:28:29,895
So, Bobby Reed
is in Rolan's sights,

00:28:29,895 --> 00:28:33,098
but Bobby's friend ends up dead,
and you and Bobby Reed

00:28:33,098 --> 00:28:35,133
are seen walking away.
No, no,

00:28:35,133 --> 00:28:37,936
it's not what it looks like.
Look, Bobby said he saw

00:28:37,936 --> 00:28:39,805
some friend of his
on the Strip and...

00:28:39,805 --> 00:28:42,541
he wanted to go say hi to him,
so he just took off.

00:28:42,541 --> 00:28:45,410
And me, I mean, I just wanted
to get the hell out of there,

00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:48,013
you know? I couldn't tell
any... When we walked away from

00:28:48,013 --> 00:28:50,749
that car, his friend was alive.

00:28:50,749 --> 00:28:52,918
And they looked
a lot alike.

00:28:52,918 --> 00:28:54,920
Maybe if Rolan
really wanted to...

00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,588
Come on.
What are you saying?

00:28:56,588 --> 00:28:58,790
You're saying that Rolan
popped the wrong guy?

00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:01,526
Forget it. I already
said too much.

00:29:01,526 --> 00:29:04,162
Number one rule
for survival:

00:29:04,162 --> 00:29:06,098
always know when to walk away.

00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,636
Jersey taught me that.

00:29:11,737 --> 00:29:13,739
You better not be lying to me.

00:29:13,739 --> 00:29:15,040
I'm not.

00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,009
And I didn't lie
about that ring, either.

00:29:17,009 --> 00:29:19,044
She really did sell it to me.
Wait a minute.

00:29:19,044 --> 00:29:20,812
The two of you met in L.A.?

00:29:20,812 --> 00:29:23,548
No, I didn't meet her in L.A.
I met her in Vegas.

00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:26,585
Vegas?

00:29:26,585 --> 00:29:27,819
When?

00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,857
Couple months ago.

00:29:35,761 --> 00:29:38,964
Didn't know she was here, huh?

00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,535
HODGES:
The two bullets
we pulled from our victims

00:29:43,535 --> 00:29:45,103
exhibited not just
the same trace,

00:29:45,103 --> 00:29:46,872
but, as you will notice,

00:29:46,872 --> 00:29:48,707
identical residue patterns

00:29:48,707 --> 00:29:50,175
singed onto
their surfaces.

00:29:50,175 --> 00:29:52,644
So what? Fired
from the same gun, right?

00:29:52,644 --> 00:29:54,446
Yes and no.

00:29:54,446 --> 00:29:57,182
Heraclitus said, "You never step
into the same river twice."

00:29:57,182 --> 00:29:59,685
Well, truthfully, you
never fire the same gun

00:29:59,685 --> 00:30:02,587
twice, because each time
you fire a weapon,

00:30:02,587 --> 00:30:04,956
you ever so slightly alter
its characteristics.

00:30:04,956 --> 00:30:06,925
Heraclitus, huh?
Mmm.

00:30:06,925 --> 00:30:08,126
Go on.
All right.

00:30:08,126 --> 00:30:10,028
Polymer trace
got me thinking.

00:30:10,028 --> 00:30:12,597
Maybe we're looking
for a plastic gun.

00:30:12,597 --> 00:30:13,999
Identical markings got
me thinking further.

00:30:13,999 --> 00:30:15,033
What if you were able

00:30:15,033 --> 00:30:16,735
to duplicate a gun?

00:30:16,735 --> 00:30:19,538
One you could use once
and then simply dispose of.

00:30:19,538 --> 00:30:21,740
John Malkovich,
<i>In the Line of Fire.</i>

00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:24,710
I love you. Uh,
I mean...respect.

00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:26,578
Go on.
Okay, I want to
show you something.

00:30:29,014 --> 00:30:31,450
(lilting music plays)
3-D printer?

00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:32,751
The future is here.

00:30:32,751 --> 00:30:35,487
They have scanners now
that can scan an object

00:30:35,487 --> 00:30:37,122
to generate a perfect
3-D computer model,

00:30:37,122 --> 00:30:38,657
which is then fed into

00:30:38,657 --> 00:30:41,460
a 3-D printer, which then
prints the object

00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:44,129
in three dimensions
using layers of polymer.

00:30:44,129 --> 00:30:45,931
Now, that's cool.
Mm-hmm.

00:30:45,931 --> 00:30:47,933
Primarily, 3-D
printers are used

00:30:47,933 --> 00:30:50,635
to manufacture parts
for antique cars

00:30:50,635 --> 00:30:53,004
and design prototypes.
And you think our killer...

00:30:53,004 --> 00:30:55,907
printed a gun.
Multiple guns.
Identical,

00:30:55,907 --> 00:30:57,509
disposable, untraceable.

00:30:57,509 --> 00:30:59,511
Fits the M.O. of a pro.

00:30:59,511 --> 00:31:01,580
How much do these cost?

00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:03,448
They're not cheap--
around 150 K.

00:31:03,448 --> 00:31:06,184
Okay, so they're not completely
untraceable. Get on the phone,

00:31:06,184 --> 00:31:08,920
call the manufacturer,
let's get a list going.
Okay.

00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,622
BRASS:
<i>Mr. Reed, thank you</i>
<i>for coming in.</i>

00:31:10,622 --> 00:31:12,657
I know, as city attorney,
you're very busy and...

00:31:12,657 --> 00:31:14,159
I can't believe this.

00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:17,028
Do you recognize any
of these faces with your son?

00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:19,631
This young man is, um, Keith.

00:31:19,631 --> 00:31:21,500
He's Bobby's college roommate.

00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,935
This is Bobby's cousin,
Josh, though I've...

00:31:23,935 --> 00:31:26,805
never seen him dressed
like that.

00:31:26,805 --> 00:31:28,140
You say they're both dead?

00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:30,942
Yes. Along with a young woman,
a witness.

00:31:32,677 --> 00:31:34,880
Bobby's mom and I split up
when he was four.

00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,948
She took him to live back east.

00:31:36,948 --> 00:31:38,817
After college, he came
to live out here.

00:31:38,817 --> 00:31:40,652
He wanted to make
it on his own.

00:31:40,652 --> 00:31:42,888
"Hospitality management."

00:31:42,888 --> 00:31:46,858
Mostly it just seemed
like he went to clubs. I...

00:31:46,858 --> 00:31:49,728
I figured he's young.
So you...

00:31:49,728 --> 00:31:51,963
you really didn't know, uh,
what he was into?

00:31:53,064 --> 00:31:54,800
Do you have kids?

00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,735
This isn't really about me,

00:31:56,735 --> 00:31:59,070
Mr. Reed. You know,
Bobby has been playing

00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:01,406
drug lord, and he's pissed off
the real one.

00:32:01,406 --> 00:32:03,141
A vicious bastard
named Rolan Zahl.

00:32:03,141 --> 00:32:04,776
Now, we don't

00:32:04,776 --> 00:32:06,878
have enough evidence
to bring Zahl in.

00:32:06,878 --> 00:32:08,447
But with three people dead,

00:32:08,447 --> 00:32:10,449
and maybe Bobby next,
we need your help.

00:32:10,449 --> 00:32:11,583
What can I do?

00:32:11,583 --> 00:32:13,051
Reach out to your son.

00:32:13,051 --> 00:32:15,720
Tell him to come in
and talk to us.

00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,923
Help us bring a killer
to justice.

00:32:17,923 --> 00:32:20,559
And if I can't talk him into it?

00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:22,427
Then he's looking
at street justice.

00:32:22,427 --> 00:32:23,962
And very soon.

00:32:23,962 --> 00:32:25,764
I ran Chastity's phone records.

00:32:25,764 --> 00:32:27,699
She was definitely texting
with someone

00:32:27,699 --> 00:32:30,469
about where she and Bobby
Reed were all night.

00:32:30,469 --> 00:32:32,471
Texting Rolan Zahl?

00:32:32,471 --> 00:32:34,139
I don't know.
It was a burner cell.

00:32:34,139 --> 00:32:35,474
10:20 p.m.,

00:32:35,474 --> 00:32:36,641
"Leaving the hotel with Bobby."

00:32:36,641 --> 00:32:37,642
FINLAY:
Burner cell responds,

00:32:37,642 --> 00:32:39,077
"Stay with him."

00:32:39,077 --> 00:32:40,779
SIDLE:
10:32, "In car,
heading for the Strip."

00:32:40,779 --> 00:32:41,780
FINLAY:
"Tell me

00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:43,148
where you end up."

00:32:43,148 --> 00:32:45,617
10:50, "Pulled over,
Price and Boulevard."

00:32:45,617 --> 00:32:48,453
"Keep him there,
don't let him leave."

00:32:48,453 --> 00:32:50,622
It sounds to me like someone
was closing in for the kill.

00:32:50,622 --> 00:32:52,123
That's when Chastity
got out of there.

00:32:52,123 --> 00:32:55,794
And Bobby sees a guy on
the Strip he wants to talk to.

00:32:55,794 --> 00:32:57,929
Our dealer, Adrian Dinan.

00:32:57,929 --> 00:32:59,397
And Bobby and Chastity
take off,

00:32:59,397 --> 00:33:00,932
leaving Bobby's friend
Keith behind.

00:33:00,932 --> 00:33:02,701
SIDLE: Shooter slips
into the backseat,

00:33:02,701 --> 00:33:05,604
pops the wrong guy.

00:33:05,604 --> 00:33:08,073
You know, Bobby and Keith
do look a lot alike.

00:33:08,073 --> 00:33:09,574
SANDERS:
That's a good theory.

00:33:09,574 --> 00:33:10,742
But how do we prove it?

00:33:12,043 --> 00:33:13,912
Anybody order
a break in the case?

00:33:13,912 --> 00:33:15,680
I hate it when you do that.

00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,681
You're gonna like this.

00:33:16,681 --> 00:33:18,049
Trace from our bullets--

00:33:18,049 --> 00:33:20,752
unpolymerized resin
and calcium carbide--

00:33:20,752 --> 00:33:22,454
turns out to
be a match

00:33:22,454 --> 00:33:23,755
to a 3-D printer model.

00:33:23,755 --> 00:33:27,092
One that I believe
printed our guns.

00:33:27,092 --> 00:33:28,593
Could I see that trace report?

00:33:28,593 --> 00:33:30,695
So you proved your
plastic gun theory.

00:33:31,796 --> 00:33:33,098
Congratulations.

00:33:33,098 --> 00:33:35,734
How does that
break our case?

00:33:35,734 --> 00:33:37,836
Purchase of said printer
tracks to

00:33:37,836 --> 00:33:40,038
a car restoration shop
on Madison Street

00:33:40,038 --> 00:33:41,172
in Northtown.

00:33:41,172 --> 00:33:42,173
The owner:

00:33:42,173 --> 00:33:44,142
one Rolan Zahl.

00:33:44,142 --> 00:33:45,644
Oh, looks like
we're closer to putting

00:33:45,644 --> 00:33:46,745
the murder weapon
in Zahl's hand.

00:33:46,745 --> 00:33:48,446
Not exactly Zahl's hand.

00:33:48,446 --> 00:33:50,682
Unpolymerized resin
and calcium carbide.

00:33:50,682 --> 00:33:52,851
That is not the first time
I've seen this trace.

00:33:52,851 --> 00:33:54,886
What do you mean?

00:33:54,886 --> 00:33:58,390
Same results came back
from Desert Palm last night.

00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:00,025
They were looking
for biologicals.

00:34:00,025 --> 00:34:01,459
A blood-borne pathogen.

00:34:01,459 --> 00:34:03,762
The cause of
an allergic reaction

00:34:03,762 --> 00:34:06,565
experienced by Mr. Anthony Pak.

00:34:06,565 --> 00:34:07,566
SIDLE:
Wait a minute.

00:34:07,566 --> 00:34:09,134
Isn't that our tourist

00:34:09,134 --> 00:34:11,036
who was clocked by
Mark Palmisano's latex head?

00:34:11,036 --> 00:34:12,804
Yeah.
FINLAY:
Who also had

00:34:12,804 --> 00:34:15,941
an allergic reaction,
apparently, to his own gun.

00:34:15,941 --> 00:34:17,442
Plastic guns
aren't for everyone.

00:34:17,442 --> 00:34:18,910
Context is everything,

00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:21,079
and everything is making
a lot more sense right now.

00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:22,514
Check it out.

00:34:22,514 --> 00:34:25,917
Lydia's video footage.

00:34:25,917 --> 00:34:28,186
He must have thought
she recorded the murder.

00:34:28,186 --> 00:34:29,688
It was no accident
Pak was there.

00:34:29,688 --> 00:34:32,023
No, man, he was going
for the camera.

00:34:32,023 --> 00:34:33,725
Our tourist is our killer.

00:34:48,807 --> 00:34:52,744
So Dennis Reed convinced
his son to turn himself in.

00:34:52,744 --> 00:34:54,179
Well, the guy's
the city attorney.

00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:55,914
His whole life
is about negotiation.

00:34:55,914 --> 00:34:57,716
You know, unions,
developers.

00:34:57,716 --> 00:35:01,019
This was a negotiation I didn't
think he could pull off.

00:35:01,019 --> 00:35:02,887
I guess you can't
underestimate

00:35:02,887 --> 00:35:05,056
the bond between
a father and a child.

00:35:05,056 --> 00:35:07,892
Hasn't been
my experience.

00:35:07,892 --> 00:35:09,728
Yeah, sorry.

00:35:09,728 --> 00:35:11,062
I heard about the ring.

00:35:11,062 --> 00:35:13,999
Well, you know,
that might have been

00:35:13,999 --> 00:35:16,001
one of the best
days of my life.

00:35:16,001 --> 00:35:17,869
I surprised Nancy,
my ex-wife.

00:35:17,869 --> 00:35:20,138
I gave her the ring,
took her to dinner, the ballet.

00:35:20,138 --> 00:35:21,740
Yeah, yeah, ballet.

00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,875
I like ballet.
No, I can see that.

00:35:23,875 --> 00:35:25,710
Yeah, there was a lot of good
memories in the early years.

00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:30,115
But I guess that's what you
hang onto, the good times.

00:35:30,115 --> 00:35:32,417
Even with my
daughter Ellie.

00:35:32,417 --> 00:35:33,585
I'm sorry.

00:35:33,585 --> 00:35:34,886
That's got to be hard.

00:35:34,886 --> 00:35:36,187
You know, when Nancy
and I split up,

00:35:36,187 --> 00:35:37,188
she wanted to give
the ring back.

00:35:37,188 --> 00:35:38,390
I said, no, give
it to Ellie.

00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:40,158
She should have it.

00:35:40,158 --> 00:35:42,894
And then she sells it to
that girl for 200 bucks.

00:35:42,894 --> 00:35:45,697
That only means that
she's in trouble,

00:35:45,697 --> 00:35:48,900
and she's not
reaching out to me.

00:35:52,604 --> 00:35:54,606
You know that guy?

00:35:54,606 --> 00:35:56,074
Never seen him before.

00:35:56,074 --> 00:35:57,642
Well, he knows you.

00:35:57,642 --> 00:35:59,444
Lucky for you,
he doesn't know you that well.

00:35:59,444 --> 00:36:00,979
That's why he popped
your buddy Keith

00:36:00,979 --> 00:36:02,547
instead of you.

00:36:02,547 --> 00:36:05,050
STOKES: You really
pissed off Rolan Zahl.

00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:07,485
He hired a hit man
to put you out of business.

00:36:07,485 --> 00:36:09,421
I know that.

00:36:09,421 --> 00:36:10,855
That's why I'm here, right?

00:36:10,855 --> 00:36:12,991
I don't get it.

00:36:12,991 --> 00:36:16,795
You have everything:
education, money, opportunity.

00:36:16,795 --> 00:36:18,930
Why the hell would you want
to be a drug dealer?

00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:20,932
You sound like my dad.

00:36:20,932 --> 00:36:23,668
These men are trying
to help you, Bobby.

00:36:23,668 --> 00:36:24,836
You should listen
to your father.

00:36:24,836 --> 00:36:26,571
I've listened plenty.

00:36:26,571 --> 00:36:29,541
I don't want to be a lawyer
or a doctor or a banker.

00:36:29,541 --> 00:36:30,742
Might as well be dead.

00:36:30,742 --> 00:36:32,477
(chuckles)

00:36:32,477 --> 00:36:34,946
I don't expect
you people to understand.

00:36:34,946 --> 00:36:37,749
What it's like
to be a player.

00:36:37,749 --> 00:36:38,917
Prince of the city.

00:36:38,917 --> 00:36:40,518
You do realize that

00:36:40,518 --> 00:36:41,920
three people are dead
because of you, right?

00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,388
That's not on me.

00:36:43,388 --> 00:36:45,123
Do you have any idea
what you've done?

00:36:45,123 --> 00:36:46,758
What the hell is
wrong with you?

00:36:46,758 --> 00:36:48,793
I know exactly
what I've done, Dad.

00:36:48,793 --> 00:36:50,895
And I know where I'm going.

00:36:50,895 --> 00:36:52,464
Just like old times.

00:36:52,464 --> 00:36:53,665
You get weekend visits.

00:36:53,665 --> 00:36:55,500
And, hey,
maybe if you show up

00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,869
more often this time,
you'll figure me out.

00:36:59,537 --> 00:37:02,574
Got something for me
to sign, don't you?

00:37:02,574 --> 00:37:04,809
We do.

00:37:06,611 --> 00:37:08,446
Okay.

00:37:08,446 --> 00:37:10,715
So the college boy's in;
what about you?

00:37:10,715 --> 00:37:12,984
Do I really
have a choice?

00:37:12,984 --> 00:37:15,954
Right now, you're just
looking at solicitation.

00:37:15,954 --> 00:37:19,424
I'd rather have your help
trying to bring Rolan Zahl in

00:37:19,424 --> 00:37:21,559
than bumping up the charges
to accessory to murder.

00:37:23,628 --> 00:37:28,399
When this is all over...
then what?

00:37:31,002 --> 00:37:33,905
It's not like you guys are
gonna protect me or anything.

00:37:33,905 --> 00:37:35,640
Hey.

00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,709
Heather.

00:37:37,709 --> 00:37:39,077
Listen to me.

00:37:39,077 --> 00:37:43,448
When this is over...
I'm gonna give you money

00:37:43,448 --> 00:37:46,050
and a bus ticket
back to Butler, PA.

00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:48,753
I want you to go back home,
I want you to call your dad,

00:37:48,753 --> 00:37:51,022
I want you to try
to build a life there.

00:37:51,022 --> 00:37:53,091
And don't come back
to the Strip.

00:37:57,395 --> 00:38:00,565
SIDLE:
Chastity's made contact
with Pak.

00:38:00,565 --> 00:38:03,735
I hope she keeps him
on the hook.

00:38:03,735 --> 00:38:06,571
Looks like it's going down
at the Fashion Arcade.

00:38:06,571 --> 00:38:08,139
Fashion Arcade.
You got that, Nick?

00:38:08,139 --> 00:38:09,574
STOKES:
Yeah, copy that.

00:38:09,574 --> 00:38:10,975
We got eyes
on Bobby and Chastity.

00:38:10,975 --> 00:38:13,711
CRAWFORD:
Backup's en route.

00:38:13,711 --> 00:38:15,713
Taking up positions.

00:38:15,713 --> 00:38:16,714
I'm pulling up
CCTV cams

00:38:16,714 --> 00:38:18,650
on the Strip.

00:38:19,984 --> 00:38:23,154
I got Bobby Reed and Chastity.

00:38:23,154 --> 00:38:25,690
There's Nick and Crawford.

00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:27,458
Any sign of our shooter?
Not yet.

00:38:27,458 --> 00:38:29,861
Oh, wait a minute.

00:38:29,861 --> 00:38:31,396
Got him.

00:38:31,396 --> 00:38:32,764
Hello, Mr. Pak.

00:38:32,764 --> 00:38:33,865
Nick, we have
a visual

00:38:33,865 --> 00:38:36,534
on Pak.
Where?

00:38:36,534 --> 00:38:38,970
To the right of you at 2:00.

00:38:40,705 --> 00:38:45,410
Yeah, yeah, it... it looks
like he's texting.

00:38:47,879 --> 00:38:50,148
Yeah, he's telling them
to go to the food court.

00:38:50,148 --> 00:38:52,483
All units,
converge on the food court.

00:38:52,483 --> 00:38:54,152
All units, converge
on the food court.

00:38:54,152 --> 00:38:55,486
Pak's on the move.

00:38:55,486 --> 00:38:57,121
That's all right,
we got him.

00:39:01,492 --> 00:39:04,629
He's taking a shortcut.

00:39:04,629 --> 00:39:05,997
Where the hell did he go?

00:39:05,997 --> 00:39:07,866
Nick, we lost him.

00:39:07,866 --> 00:39:09,968
Yeah, so did we.

00:39:09,968 --> 00:39:11,636
CRAWFORD:
Where'd he go?

00:39:11,636 --> 00:39:12,904
I don't know.
I can't find him anywhere.

00:39:15,907 --> 00:39:17,909
He knows where the cameras are.

00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:34,158
LVPD.

00:39:34,158 --> 00:39:35,627
Drop the gun.

00:39:35,627 --> 00:39:38,897
Drop it or we drop you.

00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,935
CRAWFORD:
Looking good, Weiss.

00:39:50,108 --> 00:39:52,577
Pak's not talking.

00:39:52,577 --> 00:39:54,746
Not even to ask
for a lawyer?

00:39:54,746 --> 00:39:58,082
I'm sure Rolan Zahl
has that all taken care of.

00:39:58,082 --> 00:39:59,817
By the way, we searched
Rolan Zahl's

00:39:59,817 --> 00:40:01,920
auto restoration shop.

00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,688
No sign of a 3-D printer.

00:40:03,688 --> 00:40:04,656
Got rid of it.

00:40:04,656 --> 00:40:06,057
Okay, so what
do we got?

00:40:06,057 --> 00:40:08,559
We got a gun and a phone
with text messages,

00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:09,827
both in Pak's hands.

00:40:09,827 --> 00:40:13,064
And Rolan Zahl's
hands stay clean.

00:40:13,064 --> 00:40:16,167
We do have
Chastity's testimony.

00:40:16,167 --> 00:40:17,502
Uh, the word of
a prostitute?

00:40:17,502 --> 00:40:18,836
Good luck.

00:40:18,836 --> 00:40:21,639
Okay, so Zahl walks,
everybody else goes to jail.

00:40:23,408 --> 00:40:25,576
And Chastity?

00:40:25,576 --> 00:40:27,445
No, she's got a deal
that stays in place.

00:40:27,445 --> 00:40:29,113
She's getting a
second chance.

00:40:29,113 --> 00:40:31,816
She's a smart girl.
I think she'll take it.

00:40:31,816 --> 00:40:35,720
Little help from the right
person, I'm sure she will.

00:40:40,158 --> 00:40:42,093
(indistinct chatter)

00:40:52,837 --> 00:40:53,972
Waitress was busy.

00:40:53,972 --> 00:40:55,673
Thought I'd give her a hand.

00:40:55,673 --> 00:40:56,941
Man, you are
a tough guy to find.

00:40:56,941 --> 00:40:58,109
I practically had
to bribe

00:40:58,109 --> 00:40:59,777
your duty officer
just to get your 20.

00:40:59,777 --> 00:41:01,779
I just needed a little
peace and quiet

00:41:01,779 --> 00:41:04,782
to finish up these
reports for I.A.

00:41:04,782 --> 00:41:07,185
Probably having a field day
with the bloodbath in the PD

00:41:07,185 --> 00:41:09,821
and cops letting
suspects walk.

00:41:09,821 --> 00:41:12,156
Anybody getting
the ax?

00:41:12,156 --> 00:41:14,092
Not if I can help it.

00:41:19,464 --> 00:41:21,532
Chicken soup?

00:41:21,532 --> 00:41:22,734
You don't like
that stuff.

00:41:22,734 --> 00:41:24,102
Last time I saw you
with a bowl of that,

00:41:24,102 --> 00:41:25,770
it was in the hospital.

00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:28,006
Well, I'm developing a
taste for it, I guess.

00:41:28,006 --> 00:41:30,942
What's wrong, Dad?

00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:34,078
Is this about
the sheriff's offer?

00:41:34,078 --> 00:41:35,947
I don't know, M.
I-I guess

00:41:35,947 --> 00:41:38,983
I'm just not feeling
myself lately.

00:41:38,983 --> 00:41:40,651
These days,
everywhere I look,

00:41:40,651 --> 00:41:44,389
everything in my life
just seems so complicated.

00:41:44,389 --> 00:41:45,623
(chuckles)

00:41:45,623 --> 00:41:46,924
Everything, huh?

00:41:46,924 --> 00:41:48,793
Really?

00:41:48,793 --> 00:41:51,996
No, no, I d--I don't
mean everything, no.

00:41:51,996 --> 00:41:53,664
Listen to me,
I'm confused

00:41:53,664 --> 00:41:55,500
about a lot of
things right now,

00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,568
but you and me,
our relationship--

00:41:57,568 --> 00:42:02,473
that is the only thing in
my life that makes sense.

00:42:08,046 --> 00:42:09,981
Well, my shift is over.

00:42:09,981 --> 00:42:11,549
Mind if I join you?

00:42:11,549 --> 00:42:14,585
I'd be happy to have
your company--always.

00:42:14,585 --> 00:42:15,887
Would it drive you crazy

00:42:15,887 --> 00:42:18,723
if I ordered a bacon
double chili cheeseburger?

00:42:18,723 --> 00:42:20,958
Not if we order two.

00:42:22,693 --> 00:42:24,729
BRASS:
<i>Hey.</i>

00:42:24,729 --> 00:42:25,730
I just got back
from holding.

00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:26,998
Where's Heather?

00:42:26,998 --> 00:42:28,399
Who?
Heather Tile.

00:42:29,667 --> 00:42:32,670
Chastity the prostitute.

00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:35,006
Oh, yeah, somebody
made bail for her.

00:42:35,006 --> 00:42:36,007
Bail--who?

00:42:36,007 --> 00:42:37,809
I don't know.

00:42:37,809 --> 00:42:41,679
You know, actually, she
left something for you.

00:42:41,679 --> 00:42:43,614
Oh.
