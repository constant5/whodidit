00:00:12,621 --> 00:00:14,556
(various indistinct
conversations)

00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:27,168
(glasses clinking)

00:00:27,168 --> 00:00:28,236
WOMAN:
Happy birthday!

00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:29,237
MAN:
Happy birthday!

00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:31,172
MAN 2:
Thank you!

00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,719
What's this?

00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,087
I, uh...

00:00:42,087 --> 00:00:44,856
took a total shot in the dark.

00:00:44,856 --> 00:00:47,526
Please tell me I'm right?

00:00:47,526 --> 00:00:50,062
Uh, yeah, actually, you are.

00:00:50,062 --> 00:00:52,097
Well, in that case,
happy birthday.

00:00:52,097 --> 00:00:54,566
How did you know?

00:00:54,566 --> 00:00:56,568
You seem to be celebrating.

00:00:56,568 --> 00:00:59,838
And I noticed how you keep
watching that party over there.

00:00:59,838 --> 00:01:01,540
God. It's that obvious, huh?

00:01:02,608 --> 00:01:04,576
Two forks.

00:01:04,576 --> 00:01:06,445
Of course.

00:01:06,445 --> 00:01:09,147
You can't eat
birthday cake alone.

00:01:10,782 --> 00:01:12,517
All right, then, well,

00:01:12,517 --> 00:01:14,686
I guess I should blow out
the candle, huh?

00:01:14,686 --> 00:01:15,921
Unless you want me
to sing "Happy Birthday."

00:01:15,921 --> 00:01:17,956
No. No, please.

00:01:17,956 --> 00:01:20,025
Um...

00:01:24,463 --> 00:01:26,064
Hope your wish comes true.

00:01:26,064 --> 00:01:28,734
Thank you.

00:01:28,734 --> 00:01:30,669
Excuse me.

00:01:30,669 --> 00:01:33,005
Can we grab another bottle
and an extra glass?

00:01:33,005 --> 00:01:35,073
Unless the party's over.

00:01:35,073 --> 00:01:37,509
No. No, I'm not driving.

00:01:37,509 --> 00:01:39,177
It's a present
to myself.

00:01:39,177 --> 00:01:42,547
Day at the spa,
room at the hotel, dinner...

00:01:42,547 --> 00:01:44,983
Why not? Treat yourself, right?

00:01:44,983 --> 00:01:46,618
You deserve it.

00:01:55,694 --> 00:01:59,131
(sighs)

00:01:59,131 --> 00:02:01,600
Thank you.
You saved my night.

00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,638
You were a definite upturn
in my night, as well.

00:02:10,909 --> 00:02:14,579
All right, so, where to?

00:02:14,579 --> 00:02:15,881
Twelve.

00:02:15,881 --> 00:02:17,416
12 it is.

00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:19,618
18 for me.

00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:26,725
(bell chimes)

00:02:26,725 --> 00:02:30,729
Well, this is you--12.

00:02:30,729 --> 00:02:34,032
I know.

00:02:34,032 --> 00:02:37,936
Suddenly, being alone
in my hotel room

00:02:37,936 --> 00:02:40,205
doesn't sound
like that much fun.

00:02:57,689 --> 00:02:59,624
(sighs, clears his throat)

00:03:01,026 --> 00:03:02,427
(elevator bell dings)

00:03:04,529 --> 00:03:06,098
Sara?

00:03:06,098 --> 00:03:07,432
What are you doing here?

00:03:07,432 --> 00:03:08,834
Checking out.

00:03:08,834 --> 00:03:10,669
You spent the night?

00:03:10,669 --> 00:03:11,970
Why are you here?

00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:14,806
We have a body up on 18.
Homicide.

00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:18,777
Oh, I'll ride up with you.

00:03:18,777 --> 00:03:20,679
Just can't stay
away, can you?
(chuckles)

00:03:20,679 --> 00:03:21,980
(sighs)

00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,982
Happy birthday,
by the way.

00:03:30,956 --> 00:03:32,758

Hey.

00:04:40,692 --> 00:04:42,694
Thought you had the day off.

00:04:42,694 --> 00:04:45,130
I need to talk to you.

00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:47,132
Sure. Can it wait a second?

00:04:47,132 --> 00:04:48,600
No, it can't.

00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,769
Okay.

00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:54,139
I know him--the victim.

00:04:54,139 --> 00:04:55,674
What do you mean, know him?

00:04:55,674 --> 00:04:56,942
I was in his room last night.

00:04:56,942 --> 00:04:59,878
That room?
The one with the body?

00:04:59,878 --> 00:05:02,480
I was having dinner downstairs,
he came up to my table,

00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,748
I ended up in his room.

00:05:03,748 --> 00:05:06,418
I was there an hour,
maybe a little more.

00:05:06,418 --> 00:05:07,953
Nothing happened.

00:05:07,953 --> 00:05:10,789
You need to sit down
with a detective,

00:05:10,789 --> 00:05:12,657
and give him a statement,
tell him everything.

00:05:12,657 --> 00:05:14,960
Every detail.

00:05:16,494 --> 00:05:18,430
(camera shutter clicking)

00:05:20,532 --> 00:05:23,168
(indistinct radio communication)

00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,609
(sighs)

00:05:30,609 --> 00:05:32,043
Taylor Wynard.

00:05:32,043 --> 00:05:34,145
Won't be going back home
to Carson City.

00:05:34,145 --> 00:05:37,549
I count seven stab wounds,
but, uh,

00:05:37,549 --> 00:05:39,517
no defensive wounds.

00:05:39,517 --> 00:05:41,152
So he didn't put up
a fight, huh?

00:05:41,152 --> 00:05:42,721
Maybe the first penetration

00:05:42,721 --> 00:05:44,789
hit a vital,
took all the fight out of him.

00:05:44,789 --> 00:05:46,725
(grunts)

00:05:48,593 --> 00:05:50,896
STOKES: <i>Which would mean</i>
<i>the next six was somebody</i>

00:05:50,896 --> 00:05:53,064
<i>working out</i>
<i>some serious issues.</i>

00:05:53,064 --> 00:05:55,200
SANDERS:
<i>Someone he knew, maybe.</i>

00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,635
He had company.

00:05:56,635 --> 00:05:57,836
STOKES:
Lipstick says a lady.

00:05:57,836 --> 00:05:59,804
Well, I'll scan

00:05:59,804 --> 00:06:01,139
these fingerprints,
bounce 'em back

00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:02,941
to Mandy,
see if anything pops.

00:06:05,443 --> 00:06:07,946
Hey, what steak dinner
doesn't come with a steak knife?

00:06:07,946 --> 00:06:09,047
Knife's missing?

00:06:09,047 --> 00:06:10,115
Could be
the murder weapon.

00:06:10,115 --> 00:06:11,683
Weapon of opportunity.

00:06:11,683 --> 00:06:13,685
Means this wasn't
necessarily premeditated.

00:06:13,685 --> 00:06:14,786
RUSSELL:
Guys...

00:06:14,786 --> 00:06:16,721
we got a problem.

00:06:16,721 --> 00:06:18,657
(phone chimes, blips)

00:06:18,657 --> 00:06:21,526
Sara--prints on the wine glass
belong to Sara.

00:06:21,526 --> 00:06:22,761
(chuckles):
Say what?

00:06:22,761 --> 00:06:24,429
That's right.

00:06:24,429 --> 00:06:26,631
Sara just told me
that she was here last night,

00:06:26,631 --> 00:06:27,732
in this room.

00:06:27,732 --> 00:06:28,934
That's all
I know right now.

00:06:28,934 --> 00:06:30,735
But it doesn't
change anything.

00:06:30,735 --> 00:06:34,572
We still work the evidence
like we always do.

00:06:34,572 --> 00:06:36,074
SIDLE:
<i>We left the restaurant</i>

00:06:36,074 --> 00:06:37,842
and went up to his room
around 10:00.

00:06:37,842 --> 00:06:39,477
I was probably
there an hour.

00:06:39,477 --> 00:06:41,112
We sat and talked.

00:06:41,112 --> 00:06:42,213
That was it.

00:06:42,213 --> 00:06:43,581
Are you sure
about that?

00:06:43,581 --> 00:06:45,083
Your fingerprint
was on a wine glass.

00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:46,718
Uh, it was about
the third bottle,

00:06:46,718 --> 00:06:47,819
by my count.

00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:49,154
It was my birthday.

00:06:49,154 --> 00:06:51,756
So you were up in
his room for an hour,

00:06:51,756 --> 00:06:53,124
and then,
the night ended?

00:06:53,124 --> 00:06:55,193
Why? I mean, what happened?
Nothing happened.

00:06:55,193 --> 00:06:56,895
Um...

00:06:56,895 --> 00:06:59,064
I got a text, uh,

00:06:59,064 --> 00:07:01,099
from someone wishing me
a happy birthday.

00:07:01,099 --> 00:07:03,568
Someone?

00:07:03,568 --> 00:07:05,904
The text was
from Gil Grissom.

00:07:05,904 --> 00:07:07,205
Uh, that's your husband, right?

00:07:07,205 --> 00:07:09,074
You already checked
my phone records?

00:07:09,074 --> 00:07:10,608
So you got a text
from your husband,

00:07:10,608 --> 00:07:12,477
then you ended
the night abruptly.

00:07:12,477 --> 00:07:13,578
Now, your date...

00:07:13,578 --> 00:07:15,113
Hey, he was not my date.

00:07:15,113 --> 00:07:17,716
The guy... how did he react?

00:07:17,716 --> 00:07:19,584
Was he angry?

00:07:19,584 --> 00:07:21,720
Why would he be angry?
You're in his
hotel room.

00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,455
There's been a lot of drinking.

00:07:23,455 --> 00:07:26,524
He has to be thinking, you know,
this is headed to bed.

00:07:26,524 --> 00:07:28,493
I don't know
what he was thinking.

00:07:28,493 --> 00:07:30,762
But I went back to my room,
alone.

00:07:30,762 --> 00:07:33,131
Okay, well, according
to the keycard reader

00:07:33,131 --> 00:07:35,767
on your door,
that was at 11:15.

00:07:35,767 --> 00:07:37,769
That sound about right?

00:07:37,769 --> 00:07:40,472
(sighs)
Yeah.

00:07:40,472 --> 00:07:42,574
Tell me about the
phone call at midnight.

00:07:42,574 --> 00:07:44,709
What phone call?

00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:45,710
You called the victim

00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:47,445
at 12:04.

00:07:47,445 --> 00:07:48,646
Your cell to his.

00:07:48,646 --> 00:07:50,515
The call lasted
for eight minutes.

00:07:50,515 --> 00:07:52,083
No... no, I didn't.

00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:54,686
I checked the phone records...
remember?

00:08:02,761 --> 00:08:05,030
So what was she doing
here, anyways?

00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:08,767
It--it doesn't
even make sense.

00:08:08,767 --> 00:08:10,735
I don't even really think
we should talk about it.

00:08:10,735 --> 00:08:12,804
But I rode up
in the elevator with her,

00:08:12,804 --> 00:08:14,005
and she didn't say anything.

00:08:14,005 --> 00:08:15,740
Greg, I'm serious.

00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,175
I really don't want
to talk about it.

00:08:17,175 --> 00:08:18,510
All right?
Let's just

00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:21,112
try and do our job.

00:08:24,049 --> 00:08:25,784
(siren wails in distance)

00:08:25,784 --> 00:08:28,686
Hey, come check this out.

00:08:37,128 --> 00:08:38,930
SANDERS:
That's Sara's.

00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:41,433
I recognize it.

00:08:42,934 --> 00:08:45,003
CRAWFORD: After the phone call
that never happened,

00:08:45,003 --> 00:08:46,604
what did you do?

00:08:46,604 --> 00:08:48,807
I didn't do anything.
I was asleep.

00:08:48,807 --> 00:08:50,642
I've been having
a little trouble at night,

00:08:50,642 --> 00:08:52,844
so my doctor
prescribed some pills.

00:08:52,844 --> 00:08:55,480
You took a sleeping pill?

00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,681
On top of all that alcohol?

00:08:56,681 --> 00:08:57,982
Yeah, I did.

00:08:57,982 --> 00:08:59,617
The key card reader
on your door said

00:08:59,617 --> 00:09:03,688
you reentered your room
at 2:49 a.m.

00:09:03,688 --> 00:09:06,057
Crawford, that's impossible.
I never left my room.

00:09:06,057 --> 00:09:08,793
Do you want to check
the log for yourself?

00:09:10,595 --> 00:09:12,430
You see my problem?

00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:16,901
It's your whereabouts
from midnight to 3:00 a.m.

00:09:20,572 --> 00:09:23,775
(water trickling)

00:09:36,454 --> 00:09:39,157
Well, this isn't
looking good.

00:09:39,157 --> 00:09:40,992
Found damp towels
in the bathroom.

00:09:40,992 --> 00:09:44,496
Hair in the drain is
definitely not the victim's,

00:09:44,496 --> 00:09:47,799
but the length and color
are consistent with Sara's.

00:09:49,968 --> 00:09:52,003
Okay, you want to process the
bed, or you want me to do it?

00:09:52,003 --> 00:09:54,706
I'll do it.

00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:00,545
Sheets are gone.

00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,616
Greg, someone
removed the evidence.

00:10:04,616 --> 00:10:08,419
Just a warning.

00:10:08,419 --> 00:10:09,854
It's been a while
since I've stuck someone.

00:10:09,854 --> 00:10:10,855
(laughs)

00:10:10,855 --> 00:10:12,490
Hodges is the expert.

00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:13,691
I don't think you want
to be around Hodges

00:10:13,691 --> 00:10:16,194
and a sharp object right now.

00:10:16,194 --> 00:10:17,795
How come?

00:10:17,795 --> 00:10:20,131
He thinks I cheated on Grissom.

00:10:20,131 --> 00:10:21,833
Might as well have cheated
on God.

00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:25,737
In Hodges' eyes,
you pretty much did.

00:10:25,737 --> 00:10:27,872
So, that's the general consensus
around here,

00:10:27,872 --> 00:10:29,541
that I cheated
on my husband?

00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:30,808
BRODY:
You know,

00:10:30,808 --> 00:10:32,177
I never met Grissom.

00:10:32,177 --> 00:10:33,945
He was gone before I came.

00:10:33,945 --> 00:10:36,581
But the fact that I've
never seen him around...

00:10:36,581 --> 00:10:39,617
I understand.

00:10:39,617 --> 00:10:42,554
Morgan, nothing happened.

00:10:42,554 --> 00:10:44,656
Okay.

00:10:44,656 --> 00:10:47,725
Point is, I wouldn't judge
you if something did.

00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,563
Once we run a tox screen,

00:10:51,563 --> 00:10:54,566
we can extrapolate back to
establish last night's levels.

00:11:11,616 --> 00:11:14,519
FINLAY: I figured he'd have
to be really good-looking

00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:16,054
to get Sara's interest.

00:11:16,054 --> 00:11:17,589
Do you mind?

00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:19,090
You're talking
about people we know.

00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:21,759
Are we Team Grissom

00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:23,861
or are we Team Sara?

00:11:23,861 --> 00:11:25,763
Which one are we protecting?

00:11:25,763 --> 00:11:27,765
I see no reason why
we can't protect both.

00:11:27,765 --> 00:11:29,934
Clearly, they're going
through tough times.

00:11:29,934 --> 00:11:31,669
We should be respectful of that.

00:11:31,669 --> 00:11:34,005
I wasn't <i>not</i> being respectful.

00:11:34,005 --> 00:11:36,941
It just seems like people here
are a little more upset

00:11:36,941 --> 00:11:38,443
about Sara's possible infidelity

00:11:38,443 --> 00:11:40,044
than the fact that

00:11:40,044 --> 00:11:42,213
she is a suspect in a homicide.

00:11:42,213 --> 00:11:44,582
Is that the murder weapon?

00:11:44,582 --> 00:11:46,818
I hope you can tell me.
It's from the hotel.

00:11:46,818 --> 00:11:48,152
They've got hundreds

00:11:48,152 --> 00:11:50,722
just like it--
but there was one missing

00:11:50,722 --> 00:11:53,124
from the room service cart
in the victim's room.

00:11:53,124 --> 00:11:54,993
Blade length looks
to be about right.

00:11:54,993 --> 00:11:58,529
Handle would be consistent with
the hilt marks on the victim.

00:11:58,529 --> 00:11:59,931
I'm as certain as I can be

00:11:59,931 --> 00:12:01,866
without having
the actual weapon in my hand.

00:12:01,866 --> 00:12:03,668
Well, we will try
and get that for you.

00:12:11,509 --> 00:12:12,710
Hodges?

00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:14,112
Ah-ah-ah!
Do not come in here.

00:12:14,112 --> 00:12:16,080
As far as this lab
is concerned,

00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,883
you do not exist.
Look, I know you're
angry, but I...

00:12:18,883 --> 00:12:21,653
Oddly enough, this is not
a matter of my feelings.

00:12:21,653 --> 00:12:23,054
It's purely practical.

00:12:23,054 --> 00:12:24,856
I've just spent
the last three hours

00:12:24,856 --> 00:12:26,924
scrubbing any and all hint
of you from this lab,

00:12:26,924 --> 00:12:29,961
so as to eliminate
the possibility of
contaminating any evidence.

00:12:29,961 --> 00:12:33,431
You enter here, I have
to begin all over again.

00:12:33,431 --> 00:12:35,099
So you're not mad at me.

00:12:35,099 --> 00:12:37,001
I didn't say that--
I merely said that's

00:12:37,001 --> 00:12:38,870
not why I barred you
from my lab.

00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:41,439
Okay, well, you know,
I actually came here

00:12:41,439 --> 00:12:43,041
to tell you what happened.

00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:45,543
And taint my objectivity?

00:12:48,646 --> 00:12:52,884
Let's let the evidence speak
for itself, shall we?

00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:55,753
FINLAY:
Hey. How you holding up?

00:12:55,753 --> 00:12:57,422
I'm not sure.

00:12:57,422 --> 00:12:59,991
I--I've never been in
this situation before.

00:12:59,991 --> 00:13:02,126
How can you tell?
Yeah, well,
don't let Hodges

00:13:02,126 --> 00:13:03,761
be the determining factor.

00:13:03,761 --> 00:13:05,196
Do you think Nick and
Greg are back yet?

00:13:05,196 --> 00:13:07,598
I--I feel like I really
need to talk to them.

00:13:07,598 --> 00:13:08,900
Sara, go home.

00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,902
You need some distance.

00:13:10,902 --> 00:13:13,871
I should be here;
I need to help.
You can't; you know that.

00:13:13,871 --> 00:13:16,140
Just get out of here.
Go home, take a bath,

00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,009
do something to take
care of yourself.

00:13:18,009 --> 00:13:20,978
Really, this is the
last place you should be.

00:13:28,152 --> 00:13:30,021
(alarm keypad beeping, blipping)

00:13:49,707 --> 00:13:51,843
(shower running)

00:13:53,711 --> 00:13:55,613
(remote beeps,
mellow instrumental music plays)

00:14:14,065 --> 00:14:16,434
(clunk, then low whirring)

00:14:19,904 --> 00:14:21,139
(low whirring continues)

00:14:41,592 --> 00:14:42,960
I--I don't know
how it got there.

00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,595
You know, I wanted
a glass of water,

00:14:44,595 --> 00:14:46,464
and I noticed that the
dishwasher was running,

00:14:46,464 --> 00:14:47,832
so I opened it...

00:14:47,832 --> 00:14:49,634
So it was running
when you got home.
Maybe.

00:14:49,634 --> 00:14:50,868
I wasn't paying attention.

00:14:50,868 --> 00:14:52,203
Nick, somebody
is screwing with me.

00:14:52,203 --> 00:14:53,204
Who?

00:14:53,204 --> 00:14:55,807
I have no idea.

00:14:55,807 --> 00:14:57,508
SANDERS:
I checked the entire house.

00:14:57,508 --> 00:14:58,943
No sign of
forced entry.

00:14:58,943 --> 00:15:01,112
Well, who else has a key
or knows your alarm code?

00:15:01,112 --> 00:15:03,648
You guys, Grissom, that's it.

00:15:03,648 --> 00:15:04,816
Look, somebody was here.

00:15:04,816 --> 00:15:06,083
I mean, it was probably

00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:07,952
the same person that
killed Taylor Wynard.

00:15:07,952 --> 00:15:10,054
If that's true, I'm sure
we'll find evidence of it.

00:15:10,054 --> 00:15:11,489
What do you mean,
"if that's true"?

00:15:11,489 --> 00:15:14,459
Relax, okay?
We're on your side here.

00:15:14,459 --> 00:15:16,894
But you also need
to be on our side.

00:15:16,894 --> 00:15:19,030
Remember how we said
we're a family?
That means that

00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,731
we have to start telling
each other the truth.

00:15:20,731 --> 00:15:22,099
What are you talking about?

00:15:22,099 --> 00:15:23,734
Found this in
your bedroom.

00:15:23,734 --> 00:15:26,471
What is it?
Photos.

00:15:33,478 --> 00:15:36,180
RUSSELL: So this is you
and Taylor Wynard, right?

00:15:37,715 --> 00:15:39,717
I'm having trouble

00:15:39,717 --> 00:15:41,619
with you lying to me
like this, Sara.

00:15:41,619 --> 00:15:42,920
I didn't lie to you.

00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,889
It was... an omission.

00:15:44,889 --> 00:15:46,057
You can spin it
any way you want,

00:15:46,057 --> 00:15:47,758
I still got a problem with it.

00:15:47,758 --> 00:15:49,527
Yeah, but this proves what
I've been talking about.

00:15:49,527 --> 00:15:50,795
Okay? Someone else
is behind this.

00:15:50,795 --> 00:15:52,597
Sara... you knew the victim.

00:15:52,597 --> 00:15:54,465
You know how bad this looks.

00:15:54,465 --> 00:15:56,133
At the time,
I didn't think it was relevant

00:15:56,133 --> 00:15:57,502
to what happened at the hotel.

00:15:57,502 --> 00:15:58,503
Well, when did you meet him?

00:15:58,503 --> 00:15:59,937
When was this?

00:15:59,937 --> 00:16:02,940
Two weeks ago, it was
the first and only time

00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,877
that I saw him, and when he
came to my table last night,

00:16:05,877 --> 00:16:07,612
it was a complete surprise.

00:16:07,612 --> 00:16:09,814
What's going on?

00:16:09,814 --> 00:16:11,482
Come on.

00:16:11,482 --> 00:16:13,818
Pills, alcohol--
this is not you.

00:16:13,818 --> 00:16:15,520
STOKES: Yeah, according
to the tox report,

00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,421
ten hours after the fact,
your blood alcohol level

00:16:17,421 --> 00:16:19,690
was still .03.

00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:22,493
And your sleeping pills,
the zolpidem,

00:16:22,493 --> 00:16:24,195
point-nine milligrams a liter.

00:16:24,195 --> 00:16:25,663
That's impossible.

00:16:25,663 --> 00:16:26,864
Not point-nine.

00:16:26,864 --> 00:16:28,966
I--I took a single
five-milligram

00:16:28,966 --> 00:16:31,002
sleeping pill--there's no way
that it could metabolize

00:16:31,002 --> 00:16:33,004
for ten hours and
still be that high.

00:16:33,004 --> 00:16:34,605
That's not the point.

00:16:34,605 --> 00:16:36,440
It's your behavior
that's worrying me.

00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,576
I mean, you lied to me,
you lied to him.

00:16:38,576 --> 00:16:40,144
And I know
it's not my place

00:16:40,144 --> 00:16:42,747
to comment on your
personal life, but...

00:16:42,747 --> 00:16:44,515
You mean my cheating
on my husband?

00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:51,022
Truth is, he's not
my husband anymore.

00:16:52,123 --> 00:16:54,191
Why? What happened?

00:16:54,191 --> 00:16:57,028
Ask him--I'm sure he had
my best interests in mind.

00:16:57,028 --> 00:16:58,663
So...

00:16:58,663 --> 00:17:03,100
yeah, I--I've been
struggling a little bit.

00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,735
All right, well,
if anything changes,

00:17:04,735 --> 00:17:06,938
I'd appreciate a call.
Thanks.

00:17:06,938 --> 00:17:09,640
No sign of the
missing bed sheets.

00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,776
They were probably thrown
in with the hotel laundry,

00:17:11,776 --> 00:17:13,611
in which case,
they're as good as gone.

00:17:13,611 --> 00:17:15,680
Mm. Well, if this is
the murder weapon,

00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,481
there's no way
to know for sure.

00:17:17,481 --> 00:17:18,749
Pheno came back negative.

00:17:18,749 --> 00:17:21,619
There's no blood,
no tissue... nothing.

00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:23,621
Could have all
been washed away.
Yeah.

00:17:23,621 --> 00:17:26,924
Well, I guess we can say
that it's consistent
with the murder weapon,

00:17:26,924 --> 00:17:29,627
and that it was found
in Sara's house.

00:17:29,627 --> 00:17:31,028
Well, she didn't kill anybody.

00:17:31,028 --> 00:17:33,464
It's no crime
to not want to be lonely.

00:17:35,132 --> 00:17:36,667
I just finished
processing the hair

00:17:36,667 --> 00:17:38,035
from the victim's
shower drain.

00:17:38,035 --> 00:17:39,870
It's a positive match
for Sara's.

00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:43,107
Okay, so she showered.

00:17:43,107 --> 00:17:45,009
Why lie about it?
All right,
would you still

00:17:45,009 --> 00:17:47,578
think it was a lie if she
didn't remember the shower?

00:17:47,578 --> 00:17:49,747
Sara had a considerable level
of zolpidem in her system--

00:17:49,747 --> 00:17:52,116
a sleep drug
that is associated

00:17:52,116 --> 00:17:54,752
with all sorts of bizarre
sleepwalking behaviors.

00:17:54,752 --> 00:17:55,953
Yeah--
sleep-eating, sleep-driving...

00:17:55,953 --> 00:17:57,722
Almost always,

00:17:57,722 --> 00:18:00,458
the subject doesn't remember the
event afterwards.

00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:03,427
Okay, so you're suggesting
that Sara sleep-showered

00:18:03,427 --> 00:18:04,829
and doesn't remember?

00:18:04,829 --> 00:18:06,497
I am suggesting
that if that's the case,

00:18:06,497 --> 00:18:07,999
we have to consider
any other sleep-acts

00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,834
she might have
been capable of.

00:18:09,834 --> 00:18:11,736
Murder--
certainly a possibility.

00:18:13,137 --> 00:18:14,639
Incidentally,

00:18:14,639 --> 00:18:16,474
don't you think
that one of us

00:18:16,474 --> 00:18:17,608
should call Grissom?

00:18:17,608 --> 00:18:19,877
No.

00:18:19,877 --> 00:18:22,013
One of us
should <i>not</i> call Grissom.

00:18:23,848 --> 00:18:26,083
STOKES:
I wish you would've
said something

00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:29,186
about you and Grissom
splitting up.
He's so revered around here,

00:18:29,186 --> 00:18:31,722
there's no way that I
don't come out looking
like the bad guy.

00:18:31,722 --> 00:18:33,591
Come on, I would've
drank with you.

00:18:35,459 --> 00:18:36,761
That's my necklace.

00:18:36,761 --> 00:18:38,462
SIDLE: Why is my necklace
on the monitor?

00:18:38,462 --> 00:18:39,997
Sara...
Nick, did you
find that necklace

00:18:39,997 --> 00:18:41,465
in the hotel room?

00:18:41,465 --> 00:18:43,734
Sara, you shouldn't
be seeing that.

00:18:43,734 --> 00:18:45,136
Nick, listen to me, okay?

00:18:45,136 --> 00:18:46,904
I wasn't wearing
that necklace last night.

00:18:46,904 --> 00:18:50,074
That necklace was at my home
in my bedroom.

00:18:50,074 --> 00:18:52,576
You heard what Russell
just said--now, come on.

00:18:52,576 --> 00:18:56,881
Just tell me--did you
find that necklace
in the hotel room?

00:18:56,881 --> 00:18:58,082
Yes.

00:18:58,082 --> 00:19:00,651
Now, come on, let's go.
Come on.

00:19:07,992 --> 00:19:09,994
SIDLE:
<i>Ronald Basderic.</i>

00:19:09,994 --> 00:19:11,996
<i>Been terrorizing Edie</i>
<i>for six months.</i>

00:19:11,996 --> 00:19:14,131
<i>I tried to help her</i>
<i>get a restraining order,</i>

00:19:14,131 --> 00:19:15,466
<i>but the judge denied it.</i>

00:19:25,443 --> 00:19:28,546
MAN:
<i>Edie, is that creep</i>
<i>still stalking you?</i>

00:19:31,749 --> 00:19:33,451
SIDLE:
You terrorized her.

00:19:33,451 --> 00:19:34,585
You kept her awake at night.

00:19:34,585 --> 00:19:36,454
She was afraid
to walk home.

00:19:36,454 --> 00:19:37,888
It's because of you
that she stayed,

00:19:37,888 --> 00:19:39,924
and now she's dead!

00:19:41,025 --> 00:19:43,861
I know it's you, Ronald.

00:19:43,861 --> 00:19:46,797
You wanted me
to know, right?

00:19:46,797 --> 00:19:48,599
That's why you left
the necklace?

00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:51,736
I honestly have no idea
what you're talking about.

00:19:51,736 --> 00:19:52,937
The necklace that Edie gave me.

00:19:52,937 --> 00:19:54,138
Because I helped her
when she wanted

00:19:54,138 --> 00:19:55,706
a restraining order
against you.

00:19:55,706 --> 00:19:58,876
You watched every move
she made back then.

00:19:58,876 --> 00:20:01,512
I'm sure you were stalking her
when she bought it, right?

00:20:01,512 --> 00:20:03,681
You really don't
look well, Sara.

00:20:03,681 --> 00:20:05,116
I wonder if you're
not experiencing

00:20:05,116 --> 00:20:07,818
an unusual amount
of stress lately.

00:20:07,818 --> 00:20:09,153
I'm worried about you.

00:20:09,153 --> 00:20:11,655
You killed a man, Ronald.

00:20:11,655 --> 00:20:14,024
Why?
Why did you do that?

00:20:14,024 --> 00:20:15,559
Because I helped Edie?

00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:18,496
Because I...
because I stood up to you?

00:20:18,496 --> 00:20:20,798
But you were wrong
about me then, Sara.

00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:23,100
What makes you think you're
not wrong about me now?

00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,970
You've been following me;
you've been stalking me.

00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:27,738
You took
those pictures.

00:20:27,738 --> 00:20:30,074
You somehow arranged for Taylor
to be at the hotel.

00:20:30,074 --> 00:20:34,211
And did I somehow make
you go up to his room?

00:20:34,211 --> 00:20:36,847
Did I force your
infidelity on you?

00:20:36,847 --> 00:20:38,816
Stay away from me.
Speaking of which,

00:20:38,816 --> 00:20:41,485
have you called
your husband?

00:20:41,485 --> 00:20:44,622
Have you told him about the
tough day you're having?

00:20:44,622 --> 00:20:46,657
Tell you what,
let's do it together.

00:20:46,657 --> 00:20:48,893
I have his number right
here on speed dial.

00:20:48,893 --> 00:20:50,461
(speed-dial beeping rapidly)

00:20:50,461 --> 00:20:51,595
(phone clatters across floor)

00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,835
You're not gonna walk away
this time, Ronald.

00:20:57,835 --> 00:21:00,104
That's a promise.

00:21:00,104 --> 00:21:02,072
Hey, um...

00:21:02,072 --> 00:21:06,177
am I out of my mind, or are you
hiding evidence from me?

00:21:06,177 --> 00:21:08,445
Well, we're definitely not
hiding evidence from you,

00:21:08,445 --> 00:21:09,680
so it must be
that other thing

00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,816
you just said.
Yeah, I just found out

00:21:11,816 --> 00:21:15,419
that you've recovered <i>her</i> hair
in <i>his</i> shower drain.

00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:17,688
Which we only just
confirmed for ourselves.

00:21:17,688 --> 00:21:18,989
And we told you.

00:21:18,989 --> 00:21:20,424
What about the knife?

00:21:20,424 --> 00:21:22,526
She had the murder
weapon in her home.

00:21:22,526 --> 00:21:24,762
We don't know that's
the murder weapon.

00:21:24,762 --> 00:21:26,530
I know this detective badge
may be new,

00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:28,098
but I've been a cop
long enough to know

00:21:28,098 --> 00:21:30,201
how to read between the lines.

00:21:30,201 --> 00:21:33,637
That's the difference
between what you do
and what I do.

00:21:33,637 --> 00:21:35,873
I don't read between
the lines--I stay
with the evidence.

00:21:35,873 --> 00:21:37,474
And right now,

00:21:37,474 --> 00:21:39,743
there's no evidence
that says that Sara

00:21:39,743 --> 00:21:42,613
killed Taylor Wynard,
only that she was
in his room.

00:21:42,613 --> 00:21:45,850
In his room,
having an illicit affair...

00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:49,086
under the influence of alcohol
and prescription drugs,

00:21:49,086 --> 00:21:51,088
lying about her activities.

00:21:51,088 --> 00:21:53,924
Look, there you go,
between the lines again.

00:21:53,924 --> 00:21:56,060
Look, I am not gunning for Sara.

00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:58,863
I do not want a CSI
to be guilty.

00:21:58,863 --> 00:22:01,198
But I want to try to protect
the rest of you guys as well.

00:22:01,198 --> 00:22:04,635
And I keep thinking,
if this were anyone else,

00:22:04,635 --> 00:22:07,438
we would've made
the arrest by now.

00:22:11,642 --> 00:22:13,644
SIDLE:
It's Sidle. I told the la...

00:22:13,644 --> 00:22:15,679
S-I-D-L-E.

00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:17,081
I'm with
the Las Vegas Crime Lab.

00:22:17,081 --> 00:22:18,983
I need the phone records
for Ronald Basderic.

00:22:18,983 --> 00:22:20,751
No, you see,
I don't have the warrant,

00:22:20,751 --> 00:22:22,086
but if you get me
his phone records,

00:22:22,086 --> 00:22:23,821
I will get you
an administrative subpoena

00:22:23,821 --> 00:22:26,090
as soon as I'm back
in the office.

00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:28,859
How about that?

00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,762
I have to call you back.

00:22:36,066 --> 00:22:38,002
(knocking on door)

00:22:51,916 --> 00:22:53,517
Hey.
Akers.

00:22:53,517 --> 00:22:55,519
Uh, you need to
come with me, Sara.

00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:57,621
What's going on?

00:22:57,621 --> 00:23:00,858
Just... grab whatever you need,
please, and come along.

00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,795
MAN:
What are you gonna do?

00:23:04,795 --> 00:23:06,697
CRAWFORD: Any possibility
you're overreacting?

00:23:06,697 --> 00:23:07,965
She was waiting for me.

00:23:07,965 --> 00:23:09,500
She stalked me.

00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,501
She came to my work.

00:23:10,501 --> 00:23:11,735
Just...

00:23:22,546 --> 00:23:24,448
♪ ♪

00:23:52,109 --> 00:23:54,912
(sighs, clears throat)

00:24:12,429 --> 00:24:14,531
There he is. Crawford.

00:24:14,531 --> 00:24:17,001
Where is she?

00:24:18,535 --> 00:24:19,903
You processed her?!

00:24:19,903 --> 00:24:21,739
I had to.

00:24:21,739 --> 00:24:24,108
She got herself
on camera this time.

00:24:29,213 --> 00:24:30,514
(door opens)

00:24:34,651 --> 00:24:35,886
Greg, I--I never
touched him.

00:24:35,886 --> 00:24:37,654
He's setting me up--
he set me up

00:24:37,654 --> 00:24:39,590
at the hotel,
and he's setting me up now.

00:24:45,996 --> 00:24:48,532
SANDERS:
Why were you even there?

00:24:48,532 --> 00:24:49,767
Russell tells
you to go home

00:24:49,767 --> 00:24:52,036
and you go
to Basderic's workplace?

00:24:52,036 --> 00:24:54,138
I know. I--I screwed up, okay?

00:24:54,138 --> 00:24:56,106
Yeah.
But I'm telling you
that Basderic is the one

00:24:56,106 --> 00:24:57,508
behind this, okay?

00:24:57,508 --> 00:24:58,842
He left Edie's
necklace because

00:24:58,842 --> 00:25:00,544
he wanted me to know
that it was him.

00:25:07,885 --> 00:25:09,119
Where's the rest of it?

00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:10,988
That's all there is.

00:25:10,988 --> 00:25:12,523
There's only the one camera.

00:25:12,523 --> 00:25:14,625
But, Sara, the D.A.
has more than enough

00:25:14,625 --> 00:25:15,759
to charge you with.

00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:17,661
You were clearly
the aggressor here.

00:25:17,661 --> 00:25:18,729
No. Look at that!

00:25:18,729 --> 00:25:20,197
No, he knew

00:25:20,197 --> 00:25:22,099
exactly where to stand
for the camera.

00:25:22,099 --> 00:25:24,201
He--he...
he lured me to that spot.

00:25:24,201 --> 00:25:26,670
The only physical contact
that I had with Basderic

00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:28,572
is on that video.

00:25:28,572 --> 00:25:30,007
Then how did he get
those injuries?

00:25:31,642 --> 00:25:33,744
Greg, how long
have you known me?

00:25:33,744 --> 00:25:35,546
You know

00:25:35,546 --> 00:25:37,181
I didn't do this.

00:25:37,181 --> 00:25:38,982
RONALD:
<i>She's unstable.</i>

00:25:38,982 --> 00:25:42,152
I can't be the only
one who sees that.

00:25:42,152 --> 00:25:45,089
And yet she's permitted
to carry a gun and a badge.

00:25:45,089 --> 00:25:46,723
Does that seem wise?

00:25:46,723 --> 00:25:50,894
Before today, when was
the last time you saw CSI Sidle?

00:25:50,894 --> 00:25:54,531
Not since the last time she
falsely accused me of murder.

00:25:54,531 --> 00:25:56,533
The massacre at Frank's Diner.

00:25:58,802 --> 00:26:00,904
Where I lost my Edie.

00:26:00,904 --> 00:26:02,806
Is that what she did today?

00:26:02,806 --> 00:26:06,877
Did she accuse you
of murder?
Yes.

00:26:06,877 --> 00:26:08,979
Someone at a hotel.

00:26:08,979 --> 00:26:10,781
To be honest, I didn't
follow everything she said.

00:26:10,781 --> 00:26:15,152
She seemed
disoriented and confused.
And what about

00:26:15,152 --> 00:26:18,122
right before
the altercation?

00:26:18,122 --> 00:26:21,458
Do you remember
what was said exactly?

00:26:21,458 --> 00:26:23,460
Are you asking
if I provoked her?

00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,195
Is that her defense?

00:26:25,195 --> 00:26:26,930
That this is my fault somehow?

00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:30,134
I asked her to
leave me alone.

00:26:30,134 --> 00:26:32,136
She persisted.

00:26:32,136 --> 00:26:36,473
Feeling threatened, I pulled out
my phone and called 911.

00:26:36,473 --> 00:26:38,675
That's when she attacked me.

00:26:47,751 --> 00:26:49,586
Hey. How's she doing?

00:26:49,586 --> 00:26:51,889
Honestly, I'm a
little worried.
(sighs)

00:26:51,889 --> 00:26:54,858
STOKES:
She's got to be struggling
over this breakup with Grissom

00:26:54,858 --> 00:26:56,627
and just not talking
about it, you know?

00:26:56,627 --> 00:26:58,562
Feeling isolated
from the rest of us.
Yeah, so she goes

00:26:58,562 --> 00:27:00,664
and she beats the crap
out of Basderic?

00:27:00,664 --> 00:27:02,499
Well, she says she didn't do it.

00:27:02,499 --> 00:27:03,567
Her clothes
are helping her case.

00:27:03,567 --> 00:27:05,102
I just examined them--

00:27:05,102 --> 00:27:08,839
there is no hint of trace
or any transfer evidence.

00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:11,441
Well, there you go.
After the beating Basderic took,

00:27:11,441 --> 00:27:15,012
that would be impossible.
Yeah, which means
Basderic is lying.

00:27:15,012 --> 00:27:17,181
He probably beat himself up.
You know, Sara thinks

00:27:17,181 --> 00:27:19,082
that Basderic committed
the hotel murder;

00:27:19,082 --> 00:27:20,918
that the whole thing
is an elaborate setup

00:27:20,918 --> 00:27:22,653
aimed at her.

00:27:22,653 --> 00:27:24,588
Let's start talking
about what that would take.

00:27:24,588 --> 00:27:27,457
If Basderic wanted
to pull this off--

00:27:27,457 --> 00:27:28,725
kill Taylor Wynard and

00:27:28,725 --> 00:27:31,028
frame Sara,
what would that require?

00:27:31,028 --> 00:27:33,564
You would have to know that Sara
was gonna be at the hotel.

00:27:33,564 --> 00:27:35,165
Well, that wouldn't
be that hard to do.

00:27:35,165 --> 00:27:38,068
She made the reservations
online a couple of weeks ago.

00:27:38,068 --> 00:27:40,103
You just got to hack
into her e-mail.

00:27:40,103 --> 00:27:41,838
Okay. What else?

00:27:41,838 --> 00:27:43,774
He'd have to be able to get
in and out of her house,

00:27:43,774 --> 00:27:45,909
and her hotel room,
while she was still in there.

00:27:45,909 --> 00:27:49,012
And... he would have to arrange
for the victim to be

00:27:49,012 --> 00:27:51,715
at that hotel as well.
SANDERS: All right, assuming
that Basderic is the one

00:27:51,715 --> 00:27:54,718
who took those photos, he knew
about their previous encounter.

00:27:54,718 --> 00:27:56,887
STOKES: I mean, it's been
four months since

00:27:56,887 --> 00:27:59,156
Frank's Diner--he's wanted
to get back at her ever since.

00:27:59,156 --> 00:28:02,993
And who better than a crazed and
obsessive sociopath to do it?

00:28:02,993 --> 00:28:04,595
He set her up.

00:28:04,595 --> 00:28:06,597
There's got
to be evidence of it.

00:28:06,597 --> 00:28:07,731
Yeah, we just
have to find it.

00:28:14,104 --> 00:28:15,906
Thank you...

00:28:15,906 --> 00:28:17,874
for whatever strings
you pulled to get me

00:28:17,874 --> 00:28:19,610
out of here.

00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:21,078
Wasn't me.

00:28:21,078 --> 00:28:22,512
Thank Basderic.

00:28:22,512 --> 00:28:24,781
(scoffs)
He's not pursuing charges.

00:28:24,781 --> 00:28:27,417
He does have this
for you, though.

00:28:28,518 --> 00:28:29,586
Restraining order.
Mm-hmm.

00:28:29,586 --> 00:28:30,954
You're kidding me.

00:28:30,954 --> 00:28:32,990
Sara, you're out.
That's a gift.

00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:35,692
Now just... take it
and stay away from him.

00:28:36,893 --> 00:28:39,429
RUSSELL:
Gun, I keep.

00:28:39,429 --> 00:28:40,564
You're on leave
until the department

00:28:40,564 --> 00:28:41,798
can figure out
what to do with you.

00:28:41,798 --> 00:28:44,468
And, Sara, next time
you're struggling

00:28:44,468 --> 00:28:46,503
with something, anything,

00:28:46,503 --> 00:28:49,006
come talk to me.
It's important for both of us

00:28:49,006 --> 00:28:50,607
you know you can do that.
(phone chimes)

00:28:52,442 --> 00:28:54,678
Sorry, look, I--I got
a bunch of messages here

00:28:54,678 --> 00:28:56,713
from the care facility
that looks after my mother.

00:28:56,713 --> 00:28:58,982
In San Francisco?
No, no, I moved
her down here

00:28:58,982 --> 00:29:00,817
about six months ago. Although
I don't see her any more often

00:29:00,817 --> 00:29:02,486
than I did
when she was up north.

00:29:02,486 --> 00:29:05,055
Oh, great--she got her hands
on a bottle of alcohol.

00:29:05,055 --> 00:29:07,724
She's in the hospital.

00:29:07,724 --> 00:29:09,426
Just what I needed.

00:29:14,831 --> 00:29:17,868
Hi, uh, I'm looking
for Laura Sidle.

00:29:17,868 --> 00:29:19,803
Thanks.

00:29:36,086 --> 00:29:37,854
Sara.

00:29:37,854 --> 00:29:40,424
Hi, Mom.

00:29:41,525 --> 00:29:44,528
Oh, sweetie.

00:29:44,528 --> 00:29:47,197
I'm so sorry.
Mom, you can't

00:29:47,197 --> 00:29:48,565
be drinking,
you know that.

00:29:48,565 --> 00:29:49,933
You know what happens
when you start.

00:29:49,933 --> 00:29:51,201
You can't drink like that.
I'm sorry.

00:29:51,201 --> 00:29:52,869
I'm sorry.

00:29:52,869 --> 00:29:55,472
I really am.

00:29:55,472 --> 00:29:57,607
I know.
(sighs)

00:29:57,607 --> 00:29:59,643
I know you are.

00:29:59,643 --> 00:30:02,879
I pray and pray for you.

00:30:02,879 --> 00:30:05,782
All the time,
so that you wouldn't

00:30:05,782 --> 00:30:07,718
turn out like me.

00:30:07,718 --> 00:30:10,020
Mom, I'm fine, okay?

00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,555
Just--just rest.

00:30:11,555 --> 00:30:13,190
Just--just try
to rest right now.

00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:14,958
But what about the man?

00:30:14,958 --> 00:30:17,928
What man?
At the hotel.

00:30:17,928 --> 00:30:20,197
You killed him.

00:30:20,197 --> 00:30:22,566
You stabbed him.

00:30:24,167 --> 00:30:26,870
Just like I stabbed your father.

00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:28,739
Who told you that?

00:30:28,739 --> 00:30:30,107
Who did you talk to?

00:30:30,107 --> 00:30:33,143
Your friend. Ronald.

00:30:33,143 --> 00:30:34,745
He's very nice.

00:30:34,745 --> 00:30:35,879
So sweet.

00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,735
♪ ♪

00:31:12,616 --> 00:31:14,584
(whirring)

00:31:16,887 --> 00:31:18,555
(computer blipping)

00:31:38,975 --> 00:31:41,611
Hey.
What's up?

00:31:41,611 --> 00:31:43,814
Hotels have a device
that allows them

00:31:43,814 --> 00:31:45,449
to override the keycard slot,

00:31:45,449 --> 00:31:46,883
and according
to the log,

00:31:46,883 --> 00:31:49,052
someone did exactly that

00:31:49,052 --> 00:31:51,822
and entered Sara's room
just before midnight.

00:31:51,822 --> 00:31:53,990
Which means the killer
could have taken her phone,

00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:56,493
and would explain the midnight
call she said she never made.

00:31:56,493 --> 00:31:57,861
Then it would
let the killer

00:31:57,861 --> 00:31:59,963
steal the key
to re-enter the room later.

00:31:59,963 --> 00:32:02,599
He's taking a big risk
though, with her asleep.

00:32:02,599 --> 00:32:03,867
I mean, what if she woke up?

00:32:03,867 --> 00:32:05,702
Well, if she did,
she has insomnia on a level

00:32:05,702 --> 00:32:07,070
the world has never seen.

00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:08,605
I tested Sara's
sleeping pills.

00:32:08,605 --> 00:32:09,840
They had been
tampered with.

00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,875
Super-sized,
if you will.

00:32:11,875 --> 00:32:14,644
They contained more than double
the prescribed dosage.

00:32:14,644 --> 00:32:17,547
Safe to say,
she was knocked out.

00:32:17,547 --> 00:32:19,483
So Sara was set up.

00:32:19,483 --> 00:32:22,886
Now we just got to prove
that it was Basderic.

00:32:22,886 --> 00:32:24,087
BRODY:
Hey, take a look at this.

00:32:24,087 --> 00:32:25,589
These are
the shower drain covers

00:32:25,589 --> 00:32:27,657
from both Sara
and the victim's rooms.

00:32:27,657 --> 00:32:30,494
The micro-scratches on the drain
covers don't line up

00:32:30,494 --> 00:32:32,462
with the surrounding rings.

00:32:34,464 --> 00:32:36,967
But... when I swap them...

00:32:36,967 --> 00:32:38,101
Look.

00:32:41,137 --> 00:32:43,106
SANDERS:
A perfect match.

00:32:43,106 --> 00:32:45,041
That's how Sara's hair got
in the victim's room.

00:32:45,041 --> 00:32:46,977
Someone swapped
the drain covers.

00:32:46,977 --> 00:32:48,545
All right, my turn.

00:32:48,545 --> 00:32:51,982
So these are video stills
from hotel surveillance

00:32:51,982 --> 00:32:54,117
the night of the murder.

00:32:54,117 --> 00:32:56,086
BRODY: All right,
what am I looking for?

00:32:56,086 --> 00:32:57,921
This guy. Right here.

00:32:57,921 --> 00:32:59,689
Now, he seems to be
in all the right places

00:32:59,689 --> 00:33:01,458
at all the right times.
Yeah...

00:33:01,458 --> 00:33:03,493
but with that hat and
those glasses, it's hard to say.

00:33:03,493 --> 00:33:04,561
It could be anybody.

00:33:04,561 --> 00:33:05,729
True.

00:33:05,729 --> 00:33:07,130
But check <i>this</i> out.

00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:10,166
Here's Basderic
leaving work, the same day.

00:33:10,166 --> 00:33:11,668
Now, look at the shoes.

00:33:11,668 --> 00:33:13,470
Atlantic Oxfords.

00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:15,105
And notice the pants?

00:33:15,105 --> 00:33:17,908
There's a coffee stain
or something right there.

00:33:17,908 --> 00:33:19,509
Now, if we
compare the two...

00:33:21,177 --> 00:33:23,613
BRODY:
Same stain, same clothes...

00:33:23,613 --> 00:33:24,948
same guy.

00:33:24,948 --> 00:33:26,049
Nice.

00:33:26,049 --> 00:33:27,417
Which means now

00:33:27,417 --> 00:33:29,519
we can put Basderic in the hotel

00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:32,422
the night of the murder.
STOKES: Question is,
what does he really want?

00:33:32,422 --> 00:33:35,792
I mean, why would he plan it out
the way he did?

00:33:35,792 --> 00:33:38,828
Well, he's obsessed with Sara--
he wants to get back at her

00:33:38,828 --> 00:33:40,463
for belittling him
for stalking Edie.

00:33:40,463 --> 00:33:42,132
STOKES:
Okay, but what's
his endgame?

00:33:42,132 --> 00:33:44,467
If he just wants
to frame Sara for murder,

00:33:44,467 --> 00:33:46,102
he could've left
the <i>bloody</i> knife

00:33:46,102 --> 00:33:48,138
at her house-- then she
really would've been screwed.

00:33:48,138 --> 00:33:50,640
Instead, he washes it off. Why?
Same reason

00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,776
he didn't press charges
for the assault.

00:33:52,776 --> 00:33:54,844
He doesn't
want her locked up;

00:33:54,844 --> 00:33:56,112
he wants her out.

00:33:56,112 --> 00:33:57,948
Which means
he's not done with her.

00:33:57,948 --> 00:34:00,550
And I think I know why.

00:34:02,786 --> 00:34:04,988
Russell, during
the Frank Steiner murder

00:34:04,988 --> 00:34:06,790
Sara and I turned up
a previous court case

00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:08,124
that involved Basderic.

00:34:08,124 --> 00:34:10,060
I remember, civil suit--
he collected damages

00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:12,162
after somebody
assaulted him, right?
The point is

00:34:12,162 --> 00:34:14,664
that Basderic drew the guy in.

00:34:14,664 --> 00:34:16,700
He harassed and stalked his wife

00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,868
until the guy
finally came after him.

00:34:18,868 --> 00:34:21,137
Then Basderic shot him
in self-defense.

00:34:21,137 --> 00:34:22,639
Now, Sara already

00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,608
has the restraining
order against her.

00:34:24,608 --> 00:34:27,177
And she's on record
for having assaulted the guy.

00:34:27,177 --> 00:34:28,845
So if she goes after him,

00:34:28,845 --> 00:34:30,814
he could legally shoot her
and get away with it.

00:34:30,814 --> 00:34:32,816
That is the revenge
that he's after.

00:34:32,816 --> 00:34:35,819
He doesn't want to frame her,
he wants to kill her.

00:34:35,819 --> 00:34:37,821
Where's Sara now?

00:34:37,821 --> 00:34:38,888
I don't know.

00:34:38,888 --> 00:34:40,023
She won't answer her phone.

00:34:41,124 --> 00:34:43,059
(keypad beeping)

00:34:43,059 --> 00:34:45,528
(phone buzzing)

00:34:52,035 --> 00:34:54,137
(buzzing)

00:35:05,448 --> 00:35:08,852
(engine roaring,
siren whooping)

00:35:08,852 --> 00:35:10,453
(tires screech)

00:35:11,888 --> 00:35:14,991
Another ambush
by Las Vegas's finest?

00:35:14,991 --> 00:35:17,761
No, we just want to have
a friendly conversation, Ronald.

00:35:17,761 --> 00:35:20,163
Is that a weapon
you're carrying?

00:35:20,163 --> 00:35:21,765
The gun is registered.

00:35:21,765 --> 00:35:23,433
I have a permit
to carry it.

00:35:23,433 --> 00:35:25,568
I'm gonna have to relieve you
of it anyway.

00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:26,903
Just...

00:35:26,903 --> 00:35:28,538
while we're talking.

00:35:28,538 --> 00:35:30,140
Make sure nothing
goes sideways,

00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:32,509
nobody gets hurt.

00:35:37,514 --> 00:35:39,949
We know you were at the hotel.

00:35:39,949 --> 00:35:42,085
Well, that's awfully vague.

00:35:42,085 --> 00:35:43,987
Am I supposed to know what
you're talking about?

00:35:43,987 --> 00:35:45,889
You know exactly what
I'm talking about.

00:35:45,889 --> 00:35:48,124
Last night, when you stabbed
Taylor Wynard to death.

00:35:48,124 --> 00:35:49,959
And you have
evidence of this?

00:35:49,959 --> 00:35:52,162
Or am I supposed
to just...

00:35:52,162 --> 00:35:54,130
offer up a confession?

00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:56,566
Is that why
you're here?
No.

00:35:56,566 --> 00:35:59,436
I'm here to give you a warning.

00:35:59,436 --> 00:36:01,071
If you hurt Sara...

00:36:01,071 --> 00:36:02,772
She attacked me.

00:36:02,772 --> 00:36:04,774
I'm the one who
has to be worried.

00:36:04,774 --> 00:36:06,476
Maybe we should
take you in.

00:36:06,476 --> 00:36:08,211
We could hold you
for your own protection.

00:36:08,211 --> 00:36:10,914
That won't be necessary.

00:36:10,914 --> 00:36:13,416
Next time--

00:36:13,416 --> 00:36:15,518
should there be
a next time--

00:36:15,518 --> 00:36:16,786
I'll be ready.

00:36:18,722 --> 00:36:20,490
Next time's with me.

00:36:22,459 --> 00:36:24,194
I'm free to go, am I not?

00:36:24,194 --> 00:36:25,528
Nick...

00:36:27,864 --> 00:36:29,733
I won't let you hurt her.

00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:36,172
Can I have my gun, please?

00:36:39,909 --> 00:36:41,945
You be careful with that.

00:36:46,182 --> 00:36:49,018
(engine revving,
tires squealing)

00:37:11,141 --> 00:37:13,510
SIDLE:
Leave the light off.

00:37:20,083 --> 00:37:21,885
What do you want?

00:37:21,885 --> 00:37:24,521
What do I want?

00:37:24,521 --> 00:37:27,056
I'm gonna stop you.

00:37:27,056 --> 00:37:28,925
I didn't want to do this.

00:37:28,925 --> 00:37:29,993
I didn't want
to come here.

00:37:29,993 --> 00:37:32,662
But you made me,
Ronald.

00:37:32,662 --> 00:37:35,131
You discredit me at my job,
you get me arrested,

00:37:35,131 --> 00:37:36,766
you go after my mother?!

00:37:36,766 --> 00:37:38,568
You don't really think
you can get away with this.

00:37:38,568 --> 00:37:40,436
I don't really care.

00:37:40,436 --> 00:37:42,472
Somebody needs to stop you.

00:37:42,472 --> 00:37:44,841
You have ruined
so many lives.

00:37:44,841 --> 00:37:47,477
And now I'm gonna ruin yours.

00:37:48,545 --> 00:37:49,913
(gun clicks)

00:37:51,481 --> 00:37:52,615
Don't bother.

00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:58,154
I removed the firing pin
when I was in your house.

00:37:58,154 --> 00:38:00,857
Don't worry,
I'll put it back.

00:38:00,857 --> 00:38:02,692
After.

00:38:02,692 --> 00:38:06,863
This is exactly what
you wanted, isn't it?

00:38:06,863 --> 00:38:09,465
You planned all of this right
down to this minute right here.

00:38:09,465 --> 00:38:12,202
Well, at least now
you can appreciate
what I went through.

00:38:12,202 --> 00:38:14,971
The months of planning,
the attention to detail.

00:38:14,971 --> 00:38:16,973
Did you even notice?

00:38:16,973 --> 00:38:18,942
Seven stab wounds.

00:38:18,942 --> 00:38:20,510
I stabbed him seven times,

00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:22,445
just like your mother
stabbed your father.

00:38:22,445 --> 00:38:24,113
You're sick, Ronald.

00:38:24,113 --> 00:38:26,449
I watched you, Sara.

00:38:26,449 --> 00:38:28,451
I read your e-mails.

00:38:28,451 --> 00:38:30,453
I witnessed
your adolescent groping

00:38:30,453 --> 00:38:32,622
outside the bar.
You know, I had

00:38:32,622 --> 00:38:34,891
to pay Taylor to meet you
at the hotel?

00:38:34,891 --> 00:38:37,660
I told him we were
friends, that I didn't
want you to spend

00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:38,828
your birthday by yourself.

00:38:38,828 --> 00:38:40,630
I even sprung for the dessert.

00:38:43,967 --> 00:38:45,768
And now I get to kill you.

00:38:45,768 --> 00:38:47,170
Just do it already.

00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:48,605
(three rapid gunshots)

00:38:53,443 --> 00:38:55,778
You're done, Ronald.

00:38:55,778 --> 00:38:57,513
This time for real.

00:38:59,415 --> 00:39:00,617
What did I tell you,
Ronald?

00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:05,054
I said I won't let you hurt her.

00:39:06,689 --> 00:39:08,191
Blanks.

00:39:09,492 --> 00:39:11,160
You switched my ammo.

00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,695
No, he did.

00:39:12,695 --> 00:39:13,796
Must be yours.

00:39:13,796 --> 00:39:16,633
Guess I, uh, got
mixed up somehow.

00:39:16,633 --> 00:39:18,434
CRAWFORD:
There you go.

00:39:18,434 --> 00:39:20,136
Yeah.

00:39:20,136 --> 00:39:21,571
Right. Come on.

00:39:28,144 --> 00:39:30,513
Ugh! No!

00:39:30,513 --> 00:39:32,982
I do not need
that damn chair.

00:39:32,982 --> 00:39:34,617
I can walk just fine.

00:39:34,617 --> 00:39:36,886
Well, I know, Mom, but
the hospital has rules.

00:39:36,886 --> 00:39:39,455
Since when were you one
to follow rules?

00:39:39,455 --> 00:39:41,457
What was it you
used to tell me?

00:39:41,457 --> 00:39:43,459
If, um... somebody
wants to do

00:39:43,459 --> 00:39:45,628
something nice for you,
why get in their way?

00:39:45,628 --> 00:39:47,730
I did say that, didn't I?
All the time.

00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:49,832
You were full of good advice.

00:39:49,832 --> 00:39:53,436
Too bad I didn't take
any of it myself, right?

00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:57,607
Oh... (groans softly)

00:39:57,607 --> 00:39:58,875
There are so many things

00:39:58,875 --> 00:40:02,211
I wish... I had
done differently.

00:40:02,211 --> 00:40:05,982
And most of them, I...
I can't change now.

00:40:08,184 --> 00:40:10,820
But one thing I...

00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:13,423
would like to try
and change...

00:40:13,423 --> 00:40:17,560
is the way
things are between us.

00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,595
Maybe we could...

00:40:19,595 --> 00:40:22,031
visit once in a while.

00:40:22,031 --> 00:40:23,900
(sniffles)

00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:26,035
I just want you to be okay.

00:40:26,035 --> 00:40:28,504
I'm fine.

00:40:28,504 --> 00:40:30,440
I'm great.

00:40:43,086 --> 00:40:45,822
I think people would
understand if...

00:40:45,822 --> 00:40:48,057
you want to take
some time off.

00:40:48,057 --> 00:40:50,526
No, I'd rather get
right back in.

00:40:50,526 --> 00:40:52,161
You sure?

00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:55,598
Where else would I want to be?

00:40:55,598 --> 00:40:56,799
Okay.

00:41:08,878 --> 00:41:10,113
(pours coffee)

00:41:14,417 --> 00:41:16,552
Little late for an intervention,
don't you think?

00:41:16,552 --> 00:41:18,955
Well, I just...
I just thought...

00:41:18,955 --> 00:41:20,456
We.

00:41:20,456 --> 00:41:22,658
We... just thought

00:41:22,658 --> 00:41:25,828
that it might be a...
good idea to talk.

00:41:25,828 --> 00:41:27,130
SANDERS:
Or listen.

00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:28,898
Whatever you prefer.

00:41:29,999 --> 00:41:31,968
Have a seat.

00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,942
I didn't mean
to shut you guys out.

00:41:39,942 --> 00:41:43,579
I didn't tell you
about Grissom and me
because I didn't

00:41:43,579 --> 00:41:45,515
believe it myself.

00:41:45,515 --> 00:41:47,550
You know, we made that
dinner reservation together

00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:50,153
before we split up, and...

00:41:50,153 --> 00:41:53,523
as I sat there alone
in the restaurant...

00:41:56,726 --> 00:41:59,829
...I honestly expected him
to show up.

00:41:59,829 --> 00:42:01,664
I think that we all

00:42:01,664 --> 00:42:03,933
like the idea...

00:42:03,933 --> 00:42:06,202
of you two being together.

00:42:06,202 --> 00:42:08,838
And maybe it was because

00:42:08,838 --> 00:42:11,641
that was our way
of--of hanging on to him

00:42:11,641 --> 00:42:13,209
just a little bit, you know.

00:42:18,147 --> 00:42:19,749
But if it's over...

00:42:19,749 --> 00:42:21,717
it's over.

00:42:21,717 --> 00:42:24,187
Hey, you can't sit
around waiting forever.

00:42:24,187 --> 00:42:26,923
STOKES: And you'll
always have us.

00:42:28,091 --> 00:42:29,559
(laughs)

00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:31,861
(Stokes laughing)
Like it or not.

00:42:31,861 --> 00:42:33,963
Thank you.

00:42:35,932 --> 00:42:38,601
Thank you
for not giving up on me.
