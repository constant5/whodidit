Duct-taped wrists

00:09:45,394 --> 00:09:46,528
Let's pop the trunk.

00:09:51,066 --> 00:09:53,001
Oh...
(coughs)

00:09:53,001 --> 00:09:55,904
That's, uh...
Burt Markell, I presume.

00:09:57,372 --> 00:10:00,442
There's a hole in his head--
gunshot, maybe?

00:10:00,442 --> 00:10:02,744
Gas can--that would've helped
fuel the fire.

00:10:02,744 --> 00:10:04,947
So the guy
gets shot in the head,

00:10:04,947 --> 00:10:06,415
dumped in the trunk,

00:10:06,415 --> 00:10:09,251
and then the car was lit up
to destroy evidence.

00:10:09,251 --> 00:10:11,386
Let's just hope they didn't
get all of it.

00:10:11,386 --> 00:10:12,855

Hello.

00:10:14,223 --> 00:10:15,991
I'm Detective Jim Brass,
Las Vegas Police.

00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:17,526
Is there any news on Grace?

00:10:17,526 --> 00:10:19,061
We haven't found
your daughter yet,

00:10:19,061 --> 00:10:20,395
but I'm confident we will.

00:10:20,395 --> 00:10:22,364
We've identified
the deceased young men

00:10:22,364 --> 00:10:24,867
who were found at the scene
with your son Steven

00:10:24,867 --> 00:10:28,170
as J.D. Kesey and Duke Givens.

00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,204
Did you know them?

00:10:29,204 --> 00:10:31,940
No, I did--I didn't.

00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,442
Mom? Did you?
No.

00:10:33,442 --> 00:10:34,776
We also found drug paraphernalia
at the scene.

00:10:34,776 --> 00:10:36,278
Was Steven a drug user?

00:10:36,278 --> 00:10:38,380
No, he was not a drug user.
You're wrong about that.

00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,482
No, Bruce... he's right.

00:10:40,482 --> 00:10:41,917
Steven did have
a problem with drugs.

00:10:43,185 --> 00:10:44,353
Mom...

00:10:44,353 --> 00:10:45,487
You never told me.

00:10:45,487 --> 00:10:47,523
Well, he was doing
better lately.

00:10:47,523 --> 00:10:49,258
He was my son.

00:10:49,258 --> 00:10:50,759
I should've known about this.

00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:53,462
Steven asked me not to tell you.
What?

00:10:53,462 --> 00:10:57,332
I haven't been around
for the past few years.

00:10:57,332 --> 00:11:00,435
Really.
I had some... issues.

00:11:00,435 --> 00:11:03,138
And now...
Bruce, honey.

00:11:03,138 --> 00:11:05,974
I can't...
It's okay.

00:11:05,974 --> 00:11:08,143
It's okay, baby.
It's okay.

00:11:08,143 --> 00:11:09,845
AGNES:
Shh, shh.

00:11:09,845 --> 00:11:11,380
When can I see
my granddaughter Molly again?

00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,915
Very soon.

00:11:12,915 --> 00:11:15,851
We're just finishing
processing her.

00:11:15,851 --> 00:11:19,054
Hey.
Picked up exemplars
from Burt Markell's apartment.

00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:21,523
Henry confirmed
he's our DB.

00:11:21,523 --> 00:11:24,226
So, did you find
a bullet in his head?

00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:26,795
No, just a hole, and
it's not from a gunshot.

00:11:26,795 --> 00:11:28,297
It's blunt force trauma.

00:11:28,297 --> 00:11:30,332
Any idea
what the weapon was?
It's hard to tell

00:11:30,332 --> 00:11:32,034
with all the
fire damage,

00:11:32,034 --> 00:11:35,771
but the tissue on the outside
of the wound was charred

00:11:35,771 --> 00:11:37,506
along with
the tissue in the wound

00:11:37,506 --> 00:11:39,141
as well as the skull.

00:11:39,141 --> 00:11:41,376
So he was struck in the head,

00:11:41,376 --> 00:11:44,179
<i>thrown in the trunk of his car</i>
<i>and then lit up?</i>

00:11:44,179 --> 00:11:45,881
I wish that were true.

00:11:45,881 --> 00:11:48,483
What do you mean?
Take a look
at the trachea.

00:11:48,483 --> 00:11:52,821
The tissues of the oropharynx
and tracheobronchial tree

00:11:52,821 --> 00:11:54,256
were seared by fire.

00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:57,826
So you're he inhaled fire.

00:11:57,826 --> 00:12:00,395
Not just inhaled.
He swallowed it.

00:12:02,798 --> 00:12:05,834
<i>I found burn marks</i>
<i>along the esophagus</i>

00:12:05,834 --> 00:12:07,369
<i>and inside the stomach wall.</i>

00:12:07,369 --> 00:12:10,172
So he was alive in the trunk
when the car was torched.

00:12:10,172 --> 00:12:11,940
The blow to the head
didn't kill him,

00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,375
it just incapacitated him.

00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:16,011
Maybe the killer thought
he was already dead.

00:12:16,011 --> 00:12:18,080
Or the sick bastard
didn't care.

He said that

00:12:28,323 --> 00:12:30,025
she's still too
freaked out to talk.

00:12:30,025 --> 00:12:31,493

that our crime

00:12:37,199 --> 00:12:39,534
fits the pattern of
home invasion robberies.

00:12:39,534 --> 00:12:42,170
STOKES:
In the previous home invasions,

00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:43,939
the suspects left behind prints,

00:12:43,939 --> 00:12:45,507
so I compared them
against the prints

00:12:45,507 --> 00:12:47,242
we found in the Goodwin house--

00:12:47,242 --> 00:12:49,111
they were all over the place.

00:12:49,111 --> 00:12:50,479
Pretty bad crooks.

00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:51,913
Pretty dead crooks,

00:12:51,913 --> 00:12:53,448
How's that?

00:12:53,448 --> 00:12:55,317
I was entering fingerprint
exemplars from the victims

00:12:55,317 --> 00:12:58,920
in the house to exclude them,
then two of them popped on AFIS.

00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,523
J.D. Kesey and Duke Givens?

00:13:01,523 --> 00:13:03,225
Wait a minute--you're saying

00:13:03,225 --> 00:13:05,927
that two of our victims
<i>are</i> the home invaders?

00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:10,399

If he was involved,
he didn't leave prints.

00:13:13,468 --> 00:13:15,337
Okay, so we need some
new exemplars, DNA maybe.

00:13:17,072 --> 00:13:19,174

00:27:13,875 --> 00:27:15,109
Like the supplement?

00:27:15,109 --> 00:27:18,246
Yeah. But these levels
were off the charts.

00:27:18,246 --> 00:27:22,950
I have a theory, though,
as to how Burt "zinc'd out."

00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:25,219
You guys have seen <i>Caddyshack,</i>
haven't you?

00:27:26,787 --> 00:27:27,889
Mole poison.

00:27:27,889 --> 00:27:30,858
A greenskeeper's best friend.

00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:33,427
A greenskeeper like our friend
Burt Markell.

00:27:33,427 --> 00:27:36,797
You think Burt was killed
by mole poison?

00:27:36,797 --> 00:27:40,434
The active ingredient in mole
poison is zinc phosphide.

00:27:40,434 --> 00:27:45,239
And when it comes into contact
with potassium bicarbonate...

00:27:45,239 --> 00:27:48,843
it creates phosphine gas.

00:27:48,843 --> 00:27:53,447
And when that comes
into contact with oxygen--

00:27:53,447 --> 00:27:56,350
you may want to put
those on for this--

00:27:56,350 --> 00:28:00,321
creates a chemical reaction
that is, well...

00:28:00,321 --> 00:28:01,389
the bomb.

00:28:01,389 --> 00:28:02,523
Whoa.

00:28:02,523 --> 00:28:03,824
Smell the garlic?

00:28:03,824 --> 00:28:05,026
Yeah.

00:28:05,026 --> 00:28:07,328
And I see the white crystals--

00:28:07,328 --> 00:28:10,498
tetraphosphorous decaoxide.

00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,902
Well, this is impressive,

00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:18,372
but we didn't find any
mole poison in Burt's trunk.

00:28:18,372 --> 00:28:20,207
Well, that's because

00:28:20,207 --> 00:28:23,344
the mole poison wasn't
in his trunk, it was in Burt.

00:28:23,344 --> 00:28:26,380
Wait--he ingested
mole poison?

00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,982
That would kill him.

00:28:27,982 --> 00:28:29,450
I checked Burt's
FriendAgenda page.

00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:31,352
He and Sandy Larken
had a volatile relationship.

00:28:31,352 --> 00:28:33,988
And the day that
Sandy broke up with him,

00:28:33,988 --> 00:28:36,924
he posted
a virtual suicide note.

00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:39,260
Swallowing mole poison?
Yeah.

00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:43,931
And his stomach enzymes--
like the potassium bicarbonate--

00:28:43,931 --> 00:28:46,968
reacted with the poison to
create the phosphine gas.

00:28:46,968 --> 00:28:50,237
So Burt didn't swallow fire,
he belched it.

00:28:50,237 --> 00:28:52,473
Think about it:
Burt runs out of gas.

00:28:52,473 --> 00:28:54,408
But being a greenskeeper,
out of habit,

00:28:54,408 --> 00:28:56,544
he keeps an extra can of gas
in his trunk.

00:28:56,544 --> 00:29:00,881
<i>The build-up of gas in his</i>
<i>stomach causes Burt to burp.</i>

00:29:00,881 --> 00:29:02,950
<i>Causing the phosphine gas</i>
<i>to ignite.</i>

00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:05,219
<i>Combine that with the can</i>
<i>of gasoline,</i>

00:29:05,219 --> 00:29:08,990
<i>and Houston,</i>
<i>we have a problem.</i>

00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:11,092
Explains Burt's head injury,

00:29:11,092 --> 00:29:13,427
it explains the searing
of his esophagus and stomach

00:29:13,427 --> 00:29:14,428
and the trachea, too.

00:29:14,428 --> 00:29:15,930
If he was trying

00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:17,832
to kill himself,
why did he get in his car

00:29:17,832 --> 00:29:19,400
and drive across town?

00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,769
I think I know someone
we need to talk to.

00:29:21,769 --> 00:29:23,137
BRODY:
Really?

00:29:23,137 --> 00:29:26,240
Well, this time,
I'm doing all the talking.

00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,443
♪ ♪

00:29:39,854 --> 00:29:41,389
You cops keep coming around,

00:29:41,389 --> 00:29:42,890
I'm gonna insist
you pay the cover.

00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:44,058
Well, we can always

00:29:44,058 --> 00:29:45,526
have this conversation
at my place.

00:29:45,526 --> 00:29:47,928
There's no cover charge
and the drinks are free.

00:29:47,928 --> 00:29:50,297
Good night, ladies.

00:29:50,297 --> 00:29:51,999
Go on.

00:29:53,801 --> 00:29:57,004
So, how can I help
the LVPD today?

00:29:57,004 --> 00:29:59,073
J.D. Kesey and Duke Givens.

00:29:59,073 --> 00:30:00,875
What about 'em?

00:30:00,875 --> 00:30:02,410
They're two-thirds of a trio
that messed up your niece.

00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:05,079
Your boy Connor Durman
gave up their names,

00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:06,347
and now they're dead.

00:30:06,347 --> 00:30:08,382
I guess that's called karma.

00:30:08,382 --> 00:30:11,752
I mean, considering what they
did to poor little Alison.

00:30:11,752 --> 00:30:13,320
We know you
had them killed, Tony.

00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,189
(chuckles) Right.
The same way you knew

00:30:15,189 --> 00:30:17,324
I had that informant killed
a year ago.

00:30:17,324 --> 00:30:20,494
Come on, man, we've done
this dance already.

00:30:20,494 --> 00:30:23,330
I mean, if you had anything,
anything at all on me,

00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:25,466
I wouldn't be sitting here,
would I?

00:30:25,466 --> 00:30:28,369
I hope you sleep okay,
because you just

00:30:28,369 --> 00:30:30,204
killed two innocent people

00:30:30,204 --> 00:30:31,405
and orphaned
a six-year-old girl.

00:30:31,405 --> 00:30:33,307
Guess what?

00:30:33,307 --> 00:30:34,875
I sleep just fine.

00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:36,944
Whoever you hired
screwed up, Tony.

00:30:36,944 --> 00:30:38,979
J.D. and Duke
didn't rape Alison--

00:30:38,979 --> 00:30:40,748
Connor did. He lied.

00:30:42,116 --> 00:30:43,384
Sleep on that.

00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:51,492
I hope you got
that phone tap in place.

00:30:51,492 --> 00:30:54,462
I just rattled Tony Lash's cage.

00:30:54,462 --> 00:30:56,831
MALE OPERATOR:
911. What's your emergency?

00:30:56,831 --> 00:30:58,799
MOLLY:
Mommy told me to call.

00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,868
Where is your mommy?
Is she hurt?

00:31:00,868 --> 00:31:02,369
I don't know
where she is.

00:31:02,369 --> 00:31:05,172
She told me to call
if something happened.

00:31:05,172 --> 00:31:07,441
My uncle Steven
and his friends won't wake up.

00:31:07,441 --> 00:31:09,443
What's your name, honey?

00:31:09,443 --> 00:31:11,112
Molly.

00:31:11,112 --> 00:31:14,181
Molly, are your uncle
and his friends hurt?

00:31:14,181 --> 00:31:16,117
I have to go.

00:31:16,117 --> 00:31:18,119
Mommy said I should go wait
outside for the police.

00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:20,488
Molly, wait.
Don't hang up, Molly.

00:31:20,488 --> 00:31:22,523
How many times
have you listened to that?

00:31:22,523 --> 00:31:24,391
Too many.

00:31:24,391 --> 00:31:27,061
I heard about Katie.

00:31:27,061 --> 00:31:30,131
Nick's really worried
about you.

00:31:30,131 --> 00:31:32,399
But I am, too.

00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,168
When my kids were growing up,

00:31:34,168 --> 00:31:38,472
I--I coached 'em what
to do in an emergency:

00:31:38,472 --> 00:31:41,041
"Call 911, go to the neighbors.

00:31:41,041 --> 00:31:43,310
If they're not home,
wait outside."

00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:44,812
That's really good advice.

00:31:44,812 --> 00:31:46,313
Coming from a dad
who's a cop, yeah.

00:31:46,313 --> 00:31:49,917
I mean, we see tragedy
every day; we come to expect it.

00:31:49,917 --> 00:31:51,185
It's part of the job.

00:31:51,185 --> 00:31:53,487
But my daughter Maya
didn't want

00:31:53,487 --> 00:31:55,956
to raise Katie that way.

00:31:55,956 --> 00:31:58,058
You know, didn't want
her living in fear.

00:31:58,058 --> 00:31:59,493
And now she is.

00:31:59,493 --> 00:32:00,828
Yes, she is.

00:32:00,828 --> 00:32:03,831
Just like Molly.

00:32:03,831 --> 00:32:07,001
Trying not to show it;
trying to be strong.

00:32:09,503 --> 00:32:11,338
You know, something's
not right here.

00:32:11,338 --> 00:32:15,276
We--we've got a... we've
got a revenge killing

00:32:15,276 --> 00:32:17,378
staged to look
like a home invasion.

00:32:17,378 --> 00:32:19,180
Look at these photos.

00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:21,348
Only one part of the house has
been touched, ransacked.

00:32:21,348 --> 00:32:24,518
The area where the TV
and the stereo are.

00:32:24,518 --> 00:32:26,153
And the CDs
and the DVDs.

00:32:26,153 --> 00:32:28,255
It's not
a very good "staging."

00:32:28,255 --> 00:32:30,024
So you're thinking
that whoever did this

00:32:30,024 --> 00:32:31,992
<i>was</i> looking for something.

00:32:31,992 --> 00:32:35,162
Yeah, but I'm also thinking
that Molly's mom coached her,

00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:36,497
just like I coached my kids.

00:32:36,497 --> 00:32:38,165
But I'm a cop.

00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:40,467
I knew what threats in the
world I was afraid of.

00:32:40,467 --> 00:32:42,002
So what was
Grace Goodwin afraid of?

00:32:42,002 --> 00:32:43,437
Right.

00:32:43,437 --> 00:32:46,073
And what's
our killer looking for?

00:32:46,073 --> 00:32:48,142
We got missing pieces
of this puzzle.

00:32:52,012 --> 00:32:54,915
Oh, my God,
Burt ate mole poison?

00:32:54,915 --> 00:32:57,751
That is so... disgusting.

00:32:57,751 --> 00:32:58,752
And fatal.

00:32:58,752 --> 00:33:00,788
Sorry.

00:33:00,788 --> 00:33:02,823
Thank you, I...

00:33:02,823 --> 00:33:06,126
I feel like you've
brought me closure.

00:33:06,126 --> 00:33:07,428
Uh, actually, um...

00:33:07,428 --> 00:33:09,396
(wry laugh)
...we are also

00:33:09,396 --> 00:33:12,132
in need of some closure,
Miss Larken.

00:33:12,132 --> 00:33:13,934
You said the last time
that you communicated

00:33:13,934 --> 00:33:15,970
with Burt was three days ago--

00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:17,471
that "Dear John" text.

00:33:17,471 --> 00:33:19,306
His--his name's "Burt."

00:33:19,306 --> 00:33:21,075
Right.

00:33:21,075 --> 00:33:22,910
Uh, the point is
that you dumped him,

00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:24,778
but that was not the last time
that you communicated with him.

00:33:24,778 --> 00:33:26,280
Yes, it was.

00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,915
No, it wasn't.

00:33:27,915 --> 00:33:29,950
You sent him a text
an hour before he died.

00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:31,118
No, I didn't.

00:33:31,118 --> 00:33:32,920
We have
the phone records, Sandy.

00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,089
Sh--She has
the phone records.

00:33:35,089 --> 00:33:38,092
Yes, I do.

00:33:38,092 --> 00:33:39,426
You invited him to dinner.

00:33:39,426 --> 00:33:41,262
Oh...

00:33:41,262 --> 00:33:44,198
I... I wondered why Tad didn't

00:33:44,198 --> 00:33:45,199
get my invite.

00:33:45,199 --> 00:33:46,467
Who's Tad?

00:33:46,467 --> 00:33:48,035
My new boyfriend.

00:33:48,035 --> 00:33:50,170
I... the text was meant
for him, not Burt.

00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:52,306
Oops.

00:33:52,306 --> 00:33:54,008
Oops?

00:33:54,008 --> 00:33:55,242
You--you send a man

00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:56,911
in the throes
of a mole-poison

00:33:56,911 --> 00:33:59,880
suicide false hope,
send him racing to the E.R.

00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,248
to get his stomach pumped

00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:04,852
for dinner, and--and
all you can say is "Oops"?

00:34:04,852 --> 00:34:07,221
He was on his way
to the hospital?

00:34:07,221 --> 00:34:08,789
We think so.

00:34:08,789 --> 00:34:11,258
His car was parked
two blocks away.

00:34:11,258 --> 00:34:13,961
I feel really bad.

00:34:13,961 --> 00:34:15,296
Of course you do.

00:34:16,397 --> 00:34:18,966
(phone rings)
Oh...

00:34:18,966 --> 00:34:21,769
Oh, hi, Tad. (laughs)

00:34:21,769 --> 00:34:24,438
No, I--I don't
think I'm busy.

00:34:24,438 --> 00:34:26,307
I think we're just about done?

00:34:26,307 --> 00:34:27,441
Yes.
Thank you.

00:34:27,441 --> 00:34:28,842
I will be there in ten.

00:34:28,842 --> 00:34:30,244
And I am so sorry.

00:34:30,244 --> 00:34:31,378
I was such a bitch to you

00:34:31,378 --> 00:34:32,880
about missing dinner.

00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:36,250
You are not gonna
believe this story.

00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:39,420
I know what
you're thinking.

00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,755
She's a black widow.

00:34:41,755 --> 00:34:43,924
And one day,
I'm gonna prove it.

00:34:45,859 --> 00:34:47,461
RUSSELL:
There you are.

00:34:47,461 --> 00:34:51,432
I think your granddad'll
be here in a second.

00:34:54,468 --> 00:34:55,903
Tell you what.

00:34:55,903 --> 00:34:59,873
If you want anything,

00:34:59,873 --> 00:35:02,776
call this number, okay?

00:35:02,776 --> 00:35:05,446
Anytime, day or night.

00:35:05,446 --> 00:35:08,182
You call and I answer.

00:35:12,419 --> 00:35:15,055
You want me to read
to you for a sec?

00:35:15,055 --> 00:35:16,991
No.

00:35:16,991 --> 00:35:20,461
Mommy said if anything
ever happened to her,

00:35:20,461 --> 00:35:23,797
I should find a good person.

00:35:23,797 --> 00:35:25,299
Like you.

00:35:25,299 --> 00:35:28,002
And give this to them.

00:35:51,191 --> 00:35:54,128
BRUCE: Grace, I want to be
a part of your life.

00:35:54,128 --> 00:35:56,930
GRACE: No, Dad, you'll never be
a part of my life.

00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:58,265
Or Molly's.

00:35:58,265 --> 00:35:59,433
You know what you did.

00:35:59,433 --> 00:36:00,934
To me, and to Steven.

00:36:00,934 --> 00:36:02,503
BRUCE:
Honey, I got help.

00:36:02,503 --> 00:36:05,239
I'm a different man--
I want us to be a family again.

00:36:05,239 --> 00:36:07,174
GRACE: You're lucky you're
not in prison.

00:36:07,174 --> 00:36:10,210
If you come near me or Molly,
I'll go straight to the cops.

00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:13,113
I'll see you rot in jail.

00:36:13,113 --> 00:36:15,449
That's Grace's
dad's confession

00:36:15,449 --> 00:36:17,251
on tape, as far
as I'm concerned.

00:36:17,251 --> 00:36:18,919
This is what
our killer was after.

00:36:18,919 --> 00:36:19,920
Mm.

00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,989
But I'm confused.

00:36:21,989 --> 00:36:25,025
I thought we were looking at
Tony Lash for these murders.

00:36:25,025 --> 00:36:26,293
I mean, we got a
witness that puts

00:36:26,293 --> 00:36:28,228
one of Lash's guys
in the house,

00:36:28,228 --> 00:36:29,897
doing the killings for him.

00:36:29,897 --> 00:36:32,332
Well, maybe he wasn't
just killing for him.

00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,135
Maybe.

00:36:38,539 --> 00:36:40,007
Hi, Bruce.

00:36:40,007 --> 00:36:41,809
Hi.

00:36:44,011 --> 00:36:46,747
CSI Russell said you still
had some questions for me.

00:36:46,747 --> 00:36:48,449
What's your connection
to Tony Lash?

00:36:48,449 --> 00:36:50,017
Who?

00:36:50,017 --> 00:36:52,986
I--I mean, I don't know
any Tony Lash.

00:36:52,986 --> 00:36:54,354
What about Dave?

00:36:54,354 --> 00:36:56,156
"Detroit Dave"?

00:36:56,156 --> 00:36:57,324
What about him?

00:36:57,324 --> 00:36:58,492
What's this about?

00:37:01,095 --> 00:37:02,996
(clears throat)

00:37:07,501 --> 00:37:09,036
What's that?

00:37:09,036 --> 00:37:10,771
You really want
to play it this way? Really?

00:37:10,771 --> 00:37:12,906
'Cause I'll play with you.
I'm not playing!

00:37:12,906 --> 00:37:14,875
I don't know what any
of this is about!
That is your confession

00:37:14,875 --> 00:37:17,511
to molesting your
own son and daughter.

00:37:17,511 --> 00:37:20,314
Grace recorded it, man.

00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:27,154
This is some kind of trick.

00:37:27,154 --> 00:37:28,322
Trick? No, no, no.

00:37:28,322 --> 00:37:29,957
No tricks.

00:37:29,957 --> 00:37:31,425
I don't know anything
about any recording.

00:37:31,425 --> 00:37:33,127
That disc is
why you had them killed.

00:37:33,127 --> 00:37:35,229
That disc is why
you joined up

00:37:35,229 --> 00:37:39,066
with Tony Lash to beat
and murder four people,

00:37:39,066 --> 00:37:42,169
including your own
son and daughter.

00:37:42,169 --> 00:37:43,470
No!

00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:44,938
I loved my daughter!

00:37:44,938 --> 00:37:46,173
And my son!

00:37:50,878 --> 00:37:51,979
I know I hurt them.

00:37:51,979 --> 00:37:54,481
I know I did.

00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:56,316
But that was
a very long time ago.

00:37:56,316 --> 00:37:58,886
I'm not that man anymore.

00:37:58,886 --> 00:38:02,489
And all I wanted was
the chance to prove it...

00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:04,925
have my family back
together again.

00:38:04,925 --> 00:38:07,294
Well, that may have been
what you wanted.

00:38:07,294 --> 00:38:09,263
But that damn sure wasn't
what Grace or Steven wanted.

00:38:09,263 --> 00:38:12,966
There was no way in hell she
was letting you go near Molly.

00:38:12,966 --> 00:38:15,068
And I think that Grace

00:38:15,068 --> 00:38:18,805
wanted us to find that,
so that even in death,

00:38:18,805 --> 00:38:20,841
she can bear witness
against you.

00:38:20,841 --> 00:38:23,043
It doesn't matter
what you think.

00:38:23,043 --> 00:38:25,179
My family is the most
important thing to me.

00:38:25,179 --> 00:38:28,382
I would die before
I hurt them again.

00:38:28,382 --> 00:38:30,851
STOKES:
<i>I don't think he knew anything</i>
<i>about that recording.</i>

00:38:30,851 --> 00:38:32,252
What about the murders?

00:38:32,252 --> 00:38:33,854
Don't think he knew anything
about them, either.

00:38:33,854 --> 00:38:35,155
Okay, so, what do we got?

00:38:35,155 --> 00:38:36,823
We have two of our victims--

00:38:36,823 --> 00:38:38,258
J.D. and Duke,

00:38:38,258 --> 00:38:39,526
clearly connect
to Tony Lash.

00:38:39,526 --> 00:38:42,763
Revenge killing
for raping his niece.

00:38:42,763 --> 00:38:45,065
And the other two--Grace
and Steven Goodwin--to Bruce,

00:38:45,065 --> 00:38:46,833
to cover up for his past crimes.

00:38:46,833 --> 00:38:49,870
But if Bruce didn't
hook up with Lash

00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:52,940
to commit these murders,
the question is who did?

00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:54,441
Just got off the
phone with Brass.

00:38:54,441 --> 00:38:57,211
The wiretap on Lash's
phone just came through.

00:38:57,211 --> 00:38:59,780
I guess Brass really
did rattle his cage.

00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:01,848
Did he reach out
to "Dave from Detroit"?

00:39:01,848 --> 00:39:03,450
Brass just found him
with a bullet

00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:05,052
in his head.
Really.

00:39:05,052 --> 00:39:06,486
So Dave's not talking.

00:39:06,486 --> 00:39:09,423
No, but we got someone else
was talking plenty

00:39:09,423 --> 00:39:11,158
on that wiretap to Lash.

00:39:11,158 --> 00:39:12,526
Turns out he's got a girlfriend,

00:39:12,526 --> 00:39:15,462
who, for once,
is age appropriate.

00:39:17,231 --> 00:39:19,366
RUSSELL: Packing up
are you, Mrs. Goodwin?

00:39:19,366 --> 00:39:21,535
Oh, yes, yes.

00:39:21,535 --> 00:39:24,271
Uh, your officers
told me earlier

00:39:24,271 --> 00:39:28,475
that they had released
the crime scene.

00:39:28,475 --> 00:39:31,979
It's so hard, but it...

00:39:31,979 --> 00:39:33,780
it has to be done.

00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,249
Did you feel the same way
about killing your grandkids?

00:39:35,249 --> 00:39:37,351
Excuse me?
You know, when I first

00:39:37,351 --> 00:39:39,319
heard about you
and Tony Lash as a couple,

00:39:39,319 --> 00:39:40,988
I just, I didn't get it.

00:39:40,988 --> 00:39:42,923
Yeah, he said that you two were
high-school sweethearts;

00:39:42,923 --> 00:39:45,459
that you reconnected
after all these years.

00:39:45,459 --> 00:39:47,394
It was a really sweet story.

00:39:47,394 --> 00:39:49,930
You got a lot of stuff to go
through there, don't you?

00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:51,098
I guess I could save
her some time.

00:39:51,098 --> 00:39:52,332
STOKES:
Mm-hmm.

00:39:52,332 --> 00:39:53,900
That is, if you're
looking for a...

00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:56,837
a recording
of your son's confession,

00:39:56,837 --> 00:39:58,839
I made you a copy for you.

00:39:58,839 --> 00:40:01,041
Actually, you know what,
it's more for your lawyer.

00:40:01,041 --> 00:40:03,844
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

00:40:03,844 --> 00:40:05,345
My grandchildren

00:40:05,345 --> 00:40:07,748
were beaten to death
in this house.

00:40:07,748 --> 00:40:09,283
How dare you accuse me!

00:40:09,283 --> 00:40:11,852
Oh, we don't have
to accuse you of anything.

00:40:11,852 --> 00:40:14,054
You already took care
of that yourself.

00:40:14,054 --> 00:40:16,490
Another little recording
I want you to listen to.

00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:18,925
AGNES: Damn it, Tony,
they just arrested Bruce.

00:40:18,925 --> 00:40:20,394
Sooner or later
the cops are going

00:40:20,394 --> 00:40:22,529
to figure out who did this.
TONY: Calm down, Agnes.

00:40:22,529 --> 00:40:25,165
AGNES: Calm down?!
TONY: They're never gonna
connect this to us.

00:40:25,165 --> 00:40:26,900
AGNES: They're going
to find out we're together;

00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,468
that I had you
kill my grandkids

00:40:28,468 --> 00:40:31,538
while you were taking your
revenge on those two thugs.

00:40:31,538 --> 00:40:34,207
Boy, your family has
a bad habit of getting

00:40:34,207 --> 00:40:35,442
caught confessing on tape.

00:40:35,442 --> 00:40:36,777
Don't you think?

00:40:36,777 --> 00:40:39,079
RUSSELL:
I get Tony, revenge killing.

00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:40,447
But you...

00:40:40,447 --> 00:40:43,317
you had him
murder your own grandson,

00:40:43,317 --> 00:40:44,384
your own granddaughter.

00:40:44,384 --> 00:40:45,752
How could you do that?

00:40:45,752 --> 00:40:47,120
To protect Bruce?

00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,355
You don't understand.

00:40:48,355 --> 00:40:50,390
How could you?

00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:53,293
Bruce is my everything; my baby.

00:40:53,293 --> 00:40:55,295
There is nothing
I wouldn't do

00:40:55,295 --> 00:40:57,197
to protect him.
STOKES: And Grace...

00:40:57,197 --> 00:40:58,198
Steven, Molly--
what about them?

00:40:58,198 --> 00:40:59,433
Bruce tried everything

00:40:59,433 --> 00:41:01,835
to bring the family
back together.

00:41:01,835 --> 00:41:04,171
My son is not perfect.

00:41:04,171 --> 00:41:06,473
But Grace, that little bitch.

00:41:06,473 --> 00:41:08,909
She tricked him.

00:41:08,909 --> 00:41:11,445
And she was gonna tell everyone.

00:41:11,445 --> 00:41:13,046
Come on, they were your
own flesh and blood.

00:41:13,046 --> 00:41:15,482
They didn't grow inside of me.

00:41:15,482 --> 00:41:18,418
I didn't give them life,
feed them from my own breast.

00:41:18,418 --> 00:41:21,254
Judge me when you've lived that.

00:41:21,254 --> 00:41:23,523
We don't have to live that
to judge you.

00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:27,260
We already know
what you are.

00:41:35,369 --> 00:41:36,503
What do you think?

00:41:36,503 --> 00:41:37,971
Good, thank you.

00:41:37,971 --> 00:41:40,107
Mm-hmm.

00:41:40,107 --> 00:41:42,509
My wife made a whole bunch.

00:41:42,509 --> 00:41:44,211
For the flight.

00:41:44,211 --> 00:41:46,346
I've never been to Virginia.

00:41:46,346 --> 00:41:47,447
To my cousin's.

00:41:47,447 --> 00:41:48,949
Oh, well, Virginia's very nice.

00:41:48,949 --> 00:41:50,484
I think you'll like it.

00:41:50,484 --> 00:41:53,186
I used to live there,
for a while, when I was a kid.

00:41:53,186 --> 00:41:55,021
Really?
Mm-hmm.

00:41:55,021 --> 00:41:56,390
I lived a lot
of places, actually.

00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:57,891
Moved around a lot.

00:41:57,891 --> 00:41:59,059
It can be scary, I know.

00:41:59,059 --> 00:42:02,929
New places, new people.

00:42:02,929 --> 00:42:05,132
But you're gonna make
a lot of friends.

00:42:07,401 --> 00:42:09,870
You still got that
number I gave you?

00:42:11,538 --> 00:42:13,407
Good.

00:42:13,407 --> 00:42:16,810
'Cause if you're ever
feeling scared or sad,

00:42:16,810 --> 00:42:19,212
you know that
I'm your friend, right?

00:42:19,212 --> 00:42:20,414
So we can talk.

00:42:20,414 --> 00:42:22,282
I'd like that.

00:42:22,282 --> 00:42:24,518
Me, too.

00:42:24,518 --> 00:42:26,052
MARIA: Hey, Molly
It's time to go.

00:42:26,987 --> 00:42:28,321
Okay, sweetheart.

00:42:28,321 --> 00:42:31,258
Let me help you
with your jacket here.

00:42:37,097 --> 00:42:38,965
You all set?

00:42:38,965 --> 00:42:41,034
Yeah.

00:42:45,472 --> 00:42:46,907
Thank goodness.

00:42:48,041 --> 00:42:49,309
You're gonna do great.
