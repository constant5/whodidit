It's pretty far

00:01:49,156 --> 00:01:50,858
Could belong

nine-millimeter casings
were fired in the same weapon,

Blondie had a revolver.

00:08:28,535 --> 00:08:29,737
Hence no shell casings.

00:10:27,488 --> 00:10:29,089
Don't know.

about the easy, okay?

00:10:35,896 --> 00:10:37,831
J.J. used to come

She was a club rat.

00:10:39,633 --> 00:10:41,602
Sometimes she
worked atmosphere.

00:10:41,669 --> 00:10:42,937
Oh, atmosphere.
What's that, like turning

00:10:43,003 --> 00:10:44,638
into a smoke machine?

00:10:44,705 --> 00:10:46,640
No, more like
an ATM machine.

00:10:46,707 --> 00:10:48,075
You sit her
on a couch,

00:10:48,142 --> 00:10:49,310
tourists start
to buy her drinks,

00:10:49,376 --> 00:10:50,778
she makes me money.

00:10:50,844 --> 00:10:53,347
Yeah, especially when
the tourist leaves with her.

00:10:53,414 --> 00:10:54,915

customers, Chuck?

00:11:05,426 --> 00:11:07,928
Look at her.

00:11:07,995 --> 00:11:09,463
She even looks good
in that picture.

00:11:11,498 --> 00:11:14,468
Yeah, I admit,
she looks a whole lot better

00:11:14,535 --> 00:11:17,104
than Mrs. Espinosa upstairs.

00:11:19,273 --> 00:11:20,708
Who did it?

00:11:20,774 --> 00:11:22,343
If I knew that,
I wouldn't have driven

00:11:22,409 --> 00:11:23,811
all the way out here

This woman took care of me

00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:32,620
Went homeless a couple
of years ago...

00:11:33,787 --> 00:11:35,556
...so I moved her into my house.

00:11:35,623 --> 00:11:37,157
When the tax dudes took that,

00:11:37,224 --> 00:11:38,425
I had to rent the apartments.

Top bunk was hers,
bottom was mine...

00:11:41,128 --> 00:11:43,163
Figured it was the least
I can do,

00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:46,567

my snot nose all the time.

00:11:46,634 --> 00:11:49,003
What was J.J. doing downstairs?

00:11:49,069 --> 00:11:51,238
I told you.

00:11:51,305 --> 00:11:53,741
I don't know, so unless
you want me to start lying...

00:11:53,807 --> 00:11:54,875
You never stop.

00:12:14,828 --> 00:12:16,697
Mr. Jaynes, we'd be happy

00:12:16,764 --> 00:12:18,399
to have someone watch
your son while you're

00:12:18,465 --> 00:12:19,600
doing this, you know?

00:12:19,667 --> 00:12:21,101
He stays with me.

00:12:28,676 --> 00:12:30,444
Mr. Jaynes, is that your wife?

00:12:31,478 --> 00:12:33,580
Yeah, and his mommy.

00:12:33,647 --> 00:12:35,015
Do you have any idea
what your wife

00:12:35,082 --> 00:12:36,250
was doing
at the Glanville Apartments?

00:12:36,317 --> 00:12:37,208
She has lots of friends.

00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:39,978
She always came home
every night... to me.

00:12:40,045 --> 00:12:41,413
To our baby.

00:12:43,014 --> 00:12:45,283
Sir.

00:12:56,394 --> 00:12:57,963
We almost got all the way
around, girl.

00:12:58,029 --> 00:13:00,031
(baby cries)

00:13:08,239 --> 00:13:09,941
Maybe these will
help out a little?

00:13:11,376 --> 00:13:13,345
Or would you two
prefer to be alone?

00:13:13,411 --> 00:13:15,180
Ah, very funny.

00:13:15,246 --> 00:13:18,483
So, Grissom comes up
with a theory,

00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:19,951
and we get
to do the reenactments

00:13:20,018 --> 00:13:21,019
and the photo docs.

00:13:21,086 --> 00:13:23,855
Yeah.

00:13:23,922 --> 00:13:25,523
Well, it's...

00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:28,226
good to be the king, I suppose.

00:13:28,293 --> 00:13:29,494
Sure is.

00:13:29,561 --> 00:13:31,062
Perfect.
Mm-hmm.

00:13:33,331 --> 00:13:35,033
Oops.
Damn it.

00:13:40,905 --> 00:13:42,507
Hey, Nick, hang on.

00:13:44,142 --> 00:13:46,144
What?

00:13:57,922 --> 00:13:59,891
That look like
a bullet hole to you?

00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:02,994
Yeah. It sure does.

00:14:03,061 --> 00:14:05,063
(shutter clicks and beeps)

00:14:31,122 --> 00:14:34,159
.38 cannelured revolver round.

00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,601
I like it
when the king gets it wrong.

00:14:37,667 --> 00:14:39,169
Keeps him human.

00:14:39,236 --> 00:14:41,671
STOKES:
The bullet we found
in Mrs. Espinosa's ceiling

00:14:41,738 --> 00:14:44,174
was fired from the same revolver

00:14:44,241 --> 00:14:46,243
as the bullet that went
into her cheek.

00:14:47,544 --> 00:14:49,779
Yeah, but there were
two bullets in the apartment.

00:14:49,846 --> 00:14:52,148
And only one hole in her floor.

00:14:52,215 --> 00:14:54,150
Which means the kill shot

00:14:54,217 --> 00:14:56,152
had to be a separate event.

00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:01,525
I think we got
the timeline backwards.

00:15:02,826 --> 00:15:05,829
<i>Looks to me like</i>
<i>J.J. shot Mrs. Espinosa first.</i>

00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:12,836
<i>Then went downstairs where</i>
<i>somebody returned the favor.</i>

00:15:15,505 --> 00:15:17,507
(multiple gunshots)

00:15:20,243 --> 00:15:22,479
Yeah. Who's the somebody?

00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:24,381
'Cause the only
name on the lease

00:15:24,447 --> 00:15:26,283
is Drops,

00:15:26,349 --> 00:15:28,485
and he has
a really good alibi.

00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:30,287
Yeah and even
if he knew who it was,

00:15:30,353 --> 00:15:31,988
he's not going
to just give them up.

00:15:32,055 --> 00:15:34,624
He may not have to.

00:15:34,691 --> 00:15:35,825
So that urine sample

00:15:35,892 --> 00:15:37,360
that Greg found in the
downstairs apartment,

00:15:37,427 --> 00:15:38,862
had female epithelials in it.

00:15:38,929 --> 00:15:40,130
Now, I ran it through CODIS.

00:15:40,197 --> 00:15:42,032
I didn't get any hits,
but the suspect has

00:15:42,098 --> 00:15:44,801
half her DNA in common at
every marker with Mrs. Espinosa.

00:15:44,868 --> 00:15:46,136
It's her daughter?

00:15:46,203 --> 00:15:48,138
Mm-hmm, Dana Espinosa.

00:15:48,205 --> 00:15:49,472
Dana's got a record.

00:15:49,539 --> 00:15:51,007
She was charged
with attempted murder

00:15:51,074 --> 00:15:53,543
for something involving
a Japanese businessman

00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:54,878
with his nose full of blow,

00:15:54,945 --> 00:15:56,880
skydiving out of the
eighth story of The Palms

00:15:56,947 --> 00:15:58,982
without a parachute,
but the point is this:

00:15:59,049 --> 00:16:01,084
there was a defense witness
whose testimony exonerated her.

00:16:01,151 --> 00:16:02,986
Care to guess who?

00:16:03,053 --> 00:16:04,988
Drops.
Drops.

00:16:05,055 --> 00:16:06,690
I don't know, Kellen.

00:16:06,756 --> 00:16:08,158
I'm having trouble
with this idea

00:16:08,225 --> 00:16:09,659
that you're
such a nice guy.

00:16:09,726 --> 00:16:11,094
I mean, renting
your apartment

00:16:11,161 --> 00:16:13,163
to a little, old lady
<i>and</i> her daughter?

00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:14,631
You're right.

00:16:14,698 --> 00:16:16,433
I'm not a nice guy.

00:16:16,499 --> 00:16:18,101
But you plant your seed
in a woman,

00:16:18,168 --> 00:16:19,536
you got to take care of it.

00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:20,904
Dana's pregnant?

00:16:20,971 --> 00:16:24,374
Due next month.
That explains

00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:25,375
the urine at the scene.

00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:26,877
No bladder control,
especially in a gunfight.

00:16:26,943 --> 00:16:28,111
So make a ho a housewife.

00:16:28,178 --> 00:16:29,779
I saw that movie.

00:16:29,846 --> 00:16:32,515
Look, man, first of all,
Dana was no ho.

00:16:32,582 --> 00:16:35,418
I scooped her out the atmosphere
before she could get touched.

00:16:35,485 --> 00:16:37,387
You sure about that?

00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:39,956
STOKES:
Why would J.J. kill

00:16:40,023 --> 00:16:42,025
Mrs. Espinosa
and then try to kill Dana?

00:16:42,092 --> 00:16:44,694
I mean, they roll
in the same clique.

00:16:44,761 --> 00:16:46,763
I-I can't explain these women.

00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:49,799
One minute, they're sending
each other cupcakes on Facebook,

00:16:49,866 --> 00:16:51,568
the next, they're
trying to kill each

00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:52,903
other over a broken
curling iron.

00:16:52,969 --> 00:16:56,373
But I do know...

00:16:56,439 --> 00:16:58,208
that if J.J. tried
to creep on Dana,

00:16:58,275 --> 00:16:59,976
Dana ain't just
gonna just sit there.

00:17:00,043 --> 00:17:01,778
She a bad bitch.

00:17:01,845 --> 00:17:03,847
If someone's gunning for her
or she's gunning
for somebody else,

00:17:03,914 --> 00:17:04,981
we need to find her.

00:17:05,048 --> 00:17:06,750
You ain't gonna get her.

00:17:06,816 --> 00:17:08,885
She badder, sneakier,

00:17:08,952 --> 00:17:09,986
more dangerous.

00:17:10,053 --> 00:17:11,421
I'll warn the SWAT team.

00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:12,556
Let's give her a call.

00:17:12,622 --> 00:17:14,090
What's her phone number?
Phone call?

00:17:14,157 --> 00:17:15,759
Yeah.
From your cop phone number?

00:17:15,825 --> 00:17:17,661
Yeah.
No chance.

00:17:17,727 --> 00:17:20,130
And she won't answer
an unknown caller either.

00:17:20,197 --> 00:17:21,998
I'll text in "sugar daddy."

00:17:22,065 --> 00:17:25,168
No, this is the kind of girl
you have to find in person.

00:17:25,235 --> 00:17:26,503
Then give us some addresses.

00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:29,039
What are you going to do?
MapQuest her ass?

00:17:29,105 --> 00:17:30,607
That's not going to work.

00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:32,676
There's only one way

00:17:32,742 --> 00:17:34,277
to find this girl.

00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:35,478
Let me out.

00:17:35,545 --> 00:17:36,813
(laughing)

00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,582
No, for real.

00:17:38,648 --> 00:17:40,784
I mean, I can have her
to you today.

00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:42,686
You think we can just
pop you out of jail?

00:17:42,752 --> 00:17:45,188
Yeah. Like <i>48 Hours.</i>

00:17:45,255 --> 00:17:46,690
You know, the flick.

00:17:46,756 --> 00:17:48,158
Nolte busts Eddie out of jail.

00:17:48,225 --> 00:17:49,659
They get the bad guy.
Everything's cool.

00:17:49,726 --> 00:17:51,862
You think this is a joke, man?

00:17:51,928 --> 00:17:54,698
Dead bodies are piling up
around your new family.

00:17:54,764 --> 00:17:55,999
Now, that would worry me.

00:17:56,066 --> 00:17:58,935
But if you want to angle
for some weekend pass

00:17:59,002 --> 00:18:01,338
instead of helping us out,
that's fine, man. I understand.

00:18:01,404 --> 00:18:02,439
Let's get out of here.

00:18:02,505 --> 00:18:04,574
Hey, we out.

00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,352
Are these the
text messages

00:18:15,418 --> 00:18:16,620
that came from
Jessica Jaynes phone?

00:18:16,686 --> 00:18:19,122
Yep. No physical
phone required.

00:18:19,189 --> 00:18:21,424
Everything's stored
on the server.

00:18:21,491 --> 00:18:24,928
You ever worry that you could be
replaced by a computer?

00:18:24,995 --> 00:18:26,530
Every day of my life.

00:18:26,596 --> 00:18:29,032
Last text she sent
was to her husband's number,

00:18:29,099 --> 00:18:31,935
about a half hour before
the apartment shootings.

00:18:32,002 --> 00:18:35,238
"Wit Val she knows where
D stashed our money.

00:18:35,305 --> 00:18:37,674
"Yay! Be back
soon wit phat pockets.

00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:40,076
Kisses to you and Bebe."

00:18:40,143 --> 00:18:42,879
Sounds like this girl
was looking for a big score.

00:18:42,946 --> 00:18:45,482
We didn't find any money
in either of those apartments.

00:18:45,549 --> 00:18:48,552
Well, maybe that's what got
the old lady killed.

00:18:50,387 --> 00:18:52,155
"D" for Dana or Drops?

00:18:52,222 --> 00:18:54,391
Pull up her voice calls.

00:18:54,457 --> 00:18:56,459
Yep.

00:18:58,261 --> 00:19:00,230
Okay, the last call she got was

00:19:00,297 --> 00:19:02,699
from Valinda Carlisle.

00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:03,867
Val.

00:19:05,635 --> 00:19:07,404
Let's see what Val has to say.

00:19:08,805 --> 00:19:10,340
(touch tone dialing)

00:19:10,407 --> 00:19:11,841
(line rings)

00:19:11,908 --> 00:19:14,444
MAN (on phone):
Hello?

00:19:14,511 --> 00:19:15,712
Uh, yeah.

00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:18,582
Hey, uh, is Val around?

00:19:18,648 --> 00:19:20,717
Catherine?

00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:22,085
Warrick?

00:19:22,152 --> 00:19:25,488
I'm afraid she's unable
to come to the phone now.

00:19:25,555 --> 00:19:27,157
Permanently.

00:19:27,224 --> 00:19:28,325
How'd you get this number?

00:19:28,391 --> 00:19:29,659
Valinda called

00:19:29,726 --> 00:19:31,995
my apartment homicide vic
last night.

00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:34,431
Are there any witnesses?

00:19:34,497 --> 00:19:35,932
Unis talked to a couple of guys

00:19:35,999 --> 00:19:37,801
that went to the strip club
across the street.

00:19:37,868 --> 00:19:39,870
I think they said
they saw a pregnant woman

00:19:39,936 --> 00:19:42,072
getting into the vic's car
from the passenger side.

00:19:42,138 --> 00:19:44,374
We've got a BOLO out
on Dana Espinosa

00:19:44,441 --> 00:19:46,443
in connection
with the apartment homicides.

00:19:46,509 --> 00:19:49,312
She's considered
armed, dangerous and pregnant.

00:19:49,379 --> 00:19:51,581
Ooh, raging hormones and a gun?

00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:53,450
We've got to get that
off the streets fast.

00:19:53,516 --> 00:19:54,818
What's the plan?

00:19:54,885 --> 00:19:57,754
♪ ♪

00:20:23,947 --> 00:20:26,049
Look who it is.

00:20:26,116 --> 00:20:28,351
Mom and Dad.

00:20:30,387 --> 00:20:32,355
(handcuffs tightening)

00:20:33,456 --> 00:20:35,659
(clicking)

00:20:38,562 --> 00:20:40,230
One big happy family, huh?

00:20:41,231 --> 00:20:43,400
Yeah, sort of.

00:20:46,736 --> 00:20:48,772
Get in the car.

00:20:50,407 --> 00:20:53,343
I got a feeling
I'm going to regret this.

00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:55,078
I already do.

00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:08,250
(phone line ringing)

00:21:08,317 --> 00:21:10,686
You have reached the voice mail
of Bruce Zagberg,

00:21:10,752 --> 00:21:11,954
Registered Financial Planner.

00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,155
Please leave a message.

00:21:13,222 --> 00:21:14,323
(phone beeps)

00:21:14,389 --> 00:21:15,691
Voice mail again.

00:21:15,757 --> 00:21:17,192
DROPS:
It's 'cause
you don't call

00:21:17,259 --> 00:21:18,360
Zig-Zag Bruce.

00:21:18,427 --> 00:21:19,695
He calls you, man.

00:21:19,761 --> 00:21:22,064
Is there a burger joint
or something around here?

00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:24,233
No, but what makes you so sure

00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:26,635
Dana would go
to this guy Bruce anyway?

00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:28,036
If Dana's on the run,

00:21:28,103 --> 00:21:29,838
she gonna need some
on-the-run money.

00:21:29,905 --> 00:21:34,009
Let's say Zig-Zag handles
certain aspects of my finances.

00:21:34,076 --> 00:21:35,911
What, like laundering
the street vig?

00:21:35,978 --> 00:21:38,747
No. Actually, my 401k.

00:21:38,814 --> 00:21:41,650
Why are you always tossing
the pimp card at me, man?

00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:45,053
I guess to you,
a black man in a suit <i>is</i> a pimp.

00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,055
Oh. Did I hurt your feelings?

00:21:55,197 --> 00:21:57,232
So, is this the place?

00:21:57,299 --> 00:21:58,634
What?

00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,235
You just gonna leave me here?

00:22:00,302 --> 00:22:01,737
BRASS:
Yup.

00:22:01,803 --> 00:22:04,840
Zig-Zag Bruce ain't
gonna tell you squat.

00:22:07,209 --> 00:22:09,811
Wonder what

00:22:09,878 --> 00:22:11,446
the schools are like
around here.

00:22:11,513 --> 00:22:12,748
What?

00:22:12,814 --> 00:22:16,885
DROPS:
You know, seems like
a nice neighborhood.

00:22:16,952 --> 00:22:19,221
Yeah, probably
some sweet little

00:22:19,288 --> 00:22:22,124
foreclosures
coming up soon, too.

00:22:22,191 --> 00:22:24,126
Sounds like you're thinking
about settling down.

00:22:24,193 --> 00:22:25,961
Looks like you
were finally right

00:22:26,028 --> 00:22:27,963
about something.

00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:30,465
(garbled radio transmission)

00:22:30,532 --> 00:22:32,401
Single nine-millimeter
shell casing.

00:22:32,467 --> 00:22:34,770
Consistent
with the other murders.

00:22:34,836 --> 00:22:36,338
GRISSOM:
How about the neighbors?

00:22:36,405 --> 00:22:37,506
Nobody at home.

00:22:37,573 --> 00:22:38,907
Parents at work,
kids at school,

00:22:38,974 --> 00:22:40,842
and nannies don't like
talking to cops.

00:22:40,909 --> 00:22:42,177
What about Drops?

00:22:42,244 --> 00:22:44,146
He give us anything
besides more bodies?

00:22:44,213 --> 00:22:45,681
STOKES:
No, not yet.

00:22:46,715 --> 00:22:49,651
I'll process.

00:22:49,718 --> 00:22:51,720
Okay.

00:22:53,488 --> 00:22:55,490
(garbled radio transmission)

00:22:55,557 --> 00:22:58,493
So, who else
would Dana go to for help?

00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,863
Zig-Zag doesn't seem
to be a very big talker.

00:23:00,929 --> 00:23:04,032
You're a lot funnier
than I remember, Crime-Lab.

00:23:04,099 --> 00:23:06,134
You been going to
cop comedy school?

00:23:06,201 --> 00:23:07,269
BRASS:
Answer the question,

00:23:07,336 --> 00:23:09,938
Kellen.

00:23:10,005 --> 00:23:11,940
I got a stepsister, Sherry.

00:23:12,007 --> 00:23:13,775
Her and Dana are pretty tight.

00:23:13,842 --> 00:23:16,545
If Dana's not with
her, Sherry should

00:23:16,612 --> 00:23:17,946
at least know something.

00:23:18,013 --> 00:23:19,515
Jackson and D.

00:23:19,581 --> 00:23:21,783
Let's go.

00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:23,952
Jackson and D. Yippee.

00:23:24,019 --> 00:23:25,487
We're going to the hood.

00:23:42,304 --> 00:23:44,172
Yeah, that's her right there.

00:23:44,239 --> 00:23:45,641
The round one.

00:23:45,707 --> 00:23:48,744
Check this out
here, fellas.

00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:51,346
Y'all gonna have to let me
do this one solo.

00:23:51,413 --> 00:23:53,582
Sherry's allergic to badges.

00:23:53,649 --> 00:23:55,250
Okay, look at this.

00:23:55,317 --> 00:23:57,553
Instant
antihistamine.

00:23:57,619 --> 00:24:00,088
Look, man, the cop entourage
just ain't

00:24:00,155 --> 00:24:01,924
gonna cut it. Nah.

00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:03,926
I need to be alone.

00:24:03,992 --> 00:24:05,260
I mean, come on.

00:24:05,327 --> 00:24:06,261
Where am I going?

00:24:06,328 --> 00:24:08,530
You got your
game boy on me.

00:24:10,632 --> 00:24:13,101
Okay, check it out.

00:24:13,168 --> 00:24:15,304
I'll cover the street.

00:24:24,847 --> 00:24:27,182
What about the cuffs, yo? Cuff?

00:24:27,249 --> 00:24:28,951
(sighs)
Now, why the hell

00:24:29,017 --> 00:24:31,153
would anybody talk to someone
that's already arrested?

00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,554
Okay.

00:24:32,621 --> 00:24:34,923
Okay, Kellen, give me that.
Give me that.

00:24:37,192 --> 00:24:38,760
(laughs)
What about a business card?

00:24:38,827 --> 00:24:39,962
You know, just in case

00:24:40,028 --> 00:24:41,196
Dana ain't around,
Sherry can get

00:24:41,263 --> 00:24:42,297
in contact with us, you know?

00:24:42,364 --> 00:24:43,866
Okay.

00:24:43,932 --> 00:24:45,367
Don't make me look bad.

00:24:45,434 --> 00:24:48,036
Do the right thing.

00:24:48,103 --> 00:24:49,738
(laughs)
Cool.

00:24:49,805 --> 00:24:51,640
The Church on the Move.

00:24:52,674 --> 00:24:53,775
(car door closes)

00:24:53,842 --> 00:24:54,943
(sighs)

00:25:05,487 --> 00:25:06,588
Hey, Sher.

00:25:06,655 --> 00:25:08,190
Oh, uh-uh.

00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:09,591
You escape from jail?!

00:25:09,658 --> 00:25:11,660
No. <i>Hell,</i> no...

00:25:11,727 --> 00:25:13,328
Oh, so they just
let you out, huh?

00:25:13,395 --> 00:25:15,264
Well, I mean...

00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:16,665
Lying sack!

00:25:16,732 --> 00:25:18,967
You don't think I see 'em?

00:25:19,034 --> 00:25:21,069
You trying to get everybody
you know arrested,

00:25:21,136 --> 00:25:22,304
or maimed, or killed?

00:25:22,371 --> 00:25:25,073
Huh?! You a snake now?! A rat?!

00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,475
Wait a minute.

00:25:26,542 --> 00:25:28,944
Miss me with the BS,
all right, Sher?

00:25:29,011 --> 00:25:31,180
I'm just looking for...
For what?! For another
damn shortcut?!

00:25:31,246 --> 00:25:33,015
Dana's mother was killed.

00:25:33,081 --> 00:25:35,250
J.J. was
killed, too,

00:25:35,317 --> 00:25:36,952
and Dana's missing.

00:25:37,019 --> 00:25:39,788
Now, the cops got me out
to help find her.

00:25:39,855 --> 00:25:42,357
I thought maybe you
might know where she is.

00:25:42,424 --> 00:25:44,860
Last time I talked to her
was the night before last.

00:25:44,927 --> 00:25:47,930
She wasn't feeling too good.

00:25:47,996 --> 00:25:51,099
Had to cancel her regular
Bingo night with her mama.

00:25:51,166 --> 00:25:52,201
Well, listen, all right?

00:25:52,267 --> 00:25:54,503
If she does come
around here,

00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:56,438
or calls you, I
need you to call

00:25:56,505 --> 00:25:59,508
Captain Jim Brass,
or Nick Stokes...

00:26:01,043 --> 00:26:03,078
...at the Crime Lab.

00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:07,349
Don't look at
me like that,

00:26:07,416 --> 00:26:08,851
Sherry, please, all
right? Just do it.

00:26:08,917 --> 00:26:10,319
SHERRY:
Hold on.

00:26:37,112 --> 00:26:38,780
Stop where you are, Kellen,

00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:39,982
and drop the bag!

00:26:40,048 --> 00:26:41,183
Why?!
Drop the bag!

00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:42,451
What did I do...?
Drop it!

00:26:42,518 --> 00:26:43,519
I didn't even do nothing.

00:26:43,585 --> 00:26:44,586
Drops.
Okay.

00:26:44,653 --> 00:26:45,687
Hands above your head.

00:26:45,754 --> 00:26:47,022
Don't move.

00:26:47,089 --> 00:26:49,291
Oh, that is funky.

00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:50,559
What is that nasty stuff?!

00:26:50,626 --> 00:26:51,894
Chicken gizzards!

00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,028
Hey, we're not
on a lunch break here.

00:26:53,095 --> 00:26:54,997
At least in jail, I got one.

00:26:55,063 --> 00:26:57,499
What'd she tell you?
Nothing.
She told him nothing.

00:26:57,566 --> 00:26:58,667
All right, come on, Kellen.
We're going to jail.

00:26:58,734 --> 00:26:59,902
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:01,136
No, no, no, no, no!

00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:02,571
There's one more place
to go.
Where?

00:27:02,638 --> 00:27:03,805
The office
at my after-hours spot.

00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:04,973
Why would Dana
go there?

00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,975
Maybe to check out
the big-ass safe I got.

00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:09,411
Let's go. Ugh!

00:27:39,007 --> 00:27:41,610
♪ ♪

00:28:03,198 --> 00:28:05,300
AUTOMATED MALE VOICE:
Display last destination.

00:28:05,367 --> 00:28:06,635
Huh.

00:28:06,702 --> 00:28:09,304
(beeps)

00:28:09,371 --> 00:28:10,873
Hey!

00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,875
Hey.

00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:14,243
Got the autopsy report
on Valinda Carlisle.

00:28:14,309 --> 00:28:16,044
Thought I'd save you
a trip to the morgue.

00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:17,546
Nice.

00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:22,417
I found Jessica Jayne's purse
in the glove compartment.

00:28:22,484 --> 00:28:24,219
Really?

00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:26,955
And address to the Glanville
Apartments on the GPS.

00:28:27,022 --> 00:28:28,156
Okay.

00:28:28,223 --> 00:28:29,858
(sighs)

00:28:29,925 --> 00:28:31,460
So they were in it together.

00:28:33,061 --> 00:28:36,565
Valinda drives J.J.
to shake down Drops' family

00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:37,966
for some cash.

00:28:38,033 --> 00:28:40,202
It goes bad.

00:28:40,269 --> 00:28:41,904
J.J. kills
the mother,

00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,939
Dana kills J.J.,

00:28:44,006 --> 00:28:46,174
Valinda flees the scene,

00:28:46,241 --> 00:28:48,310
and, the next night,

00:28:48,377 --> 00:28:50,145
the pissed-off
pregnant chick

00:28:50,212 --> 00:28:54,650
tracks down Valinda
and pays her back.

00:28:54,716 --> 00:28:58,854
That seems plausible,
but there's something still off.

00:28:58,921 --> 00:29:03,192
The bullet entered
through the back of the skull,

00:29:03,258 --> 00:29:05,594
and it exited
through the forehead, and...

00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:07,629
(grunts)

00:29:07,696 --> 00:29:09,131
...out through the open window.

00:29:16,371 --> 00:29:18,707
I think you got lucky.

00:29:18,774 --> 00:29:20,876
The bullet grazed
the window frame

00:29:20,943 --> 00:29:22,911
on its way out.

00:29:22,978 --> 00:29:25,147
Gives you a trajectory.

00:29:25,214 --> 00:29:27,149
Well, that's good,

00:29:27,216 --> 00:29:29,418
but the witnesses say

00:29:29,484 --> 00:29:31,153
that Valinda was
in the driver's seat

00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:34,957
when Dana got in the car,
and if that's true, then,

00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:37,826
Dana had to shoot Valinda
like this,

00:29:37,893 --> 00:29:41,530
not like this.

00:29:41,597 --> 00:29:43,498
(gunshot)
That seems
kind of

00:29:43,565 --> 00:29:45,067
awkward, don't you think?

00:29:45,133 --> 00:29:48,804
Yeah, but awkward or not,
it definitely lines up the shot.

00:29:48,871 --> 00:29:49,872
Well, it seems to me

00:29:49,938 --> 00:29:51,073
<i>that the shot came</i>

00:29:51,139 --> 00:29:52,875
<i>from the back seat.</i>

00:29:54,643 --> 00:29:56,879
There was someone else
in the car.

00:29:56,945 --> 00:29:58,547
(upbeat pop music plays)

00:29:58,614 --> 00:30:00,616
(woman singing,
loud crowd chatter)

00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:08,724
Yeah, Dana was here
about an hour ago.

00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:10,592
She was with some
NASCAR-looking dude.

00:30:10,659 --> 00:30:13,262
STOKES:
And what exactly does
a NASCAR-looking dude look like?

00:30:13,328 --> 00:30:14,730
Kind of like you.

00:30:14,796 --> 00:30:16,365
But this guy's
all inked up.

00:30:16,431 --> 00:30:19,167
He's got that
loco look.

00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:21,570
You just let a complete stranger
into your boss' office?

00:30:21,637 --> 00:30:23,038
I thought you were
a smart businessman.

00:30:23,105 --> 00:30:25,774
I mean, it was
Dana, your girl.

00:30:25,841 --> 00:30:27,743
I didn't ask questions.

00:30:30,479 --> 00:30:32,414
What is this?

00:30:32,481 --> 00:30:34,183
And where's
the DJ?

00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:35,484
That's Mini-Britney.

00:30:35,551 --> 00:30:36,952
It's what the people want.

00:30:40,656 --> 00:30:42,658
Anybody hungry?

00:30:43,825 --> 00:30:45,594
I'm going on a sandwich run.

00:30:45,661 --> 00:30:48,163
At least let me get that.

00:30:50,999 --> 00:30:52,301
Fine.
Fine.

00:30:52,367 --> 00:30:53,835
Warwick,

00:30:53,902 --> 00:30:55,671
take me back to jail.

00:30:58,974 --> 00:31:02,177
Yeah, see, I got cameras
all over this place, man.

00:31:02,244 --> 00:31:04,713
Let's see who she's with.

00:31:06,215 --> 00:31:07,816
Let's run this
back an hour.

00:31:15,157 --> 00:31:17,793
Looks like
Dana cleaned you out, man.

00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,795
Nah, wasn't nothing
in that safe, man.

00:31:19,862 --> 00:31:21,263
Only Dana didn't know that.

00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:23,665
So, how come
you never told us that before?

00:31:23,732 --> 00:31:25,200
You guys sprung me to help

00:31:25,267 --> 00:31:27,035
find her, and that's
what I'm doing.

00:31:29,271 --> 00:31:30,272
There she is.

00:31:30,339 --> 00:31:32,007
(typing)

00:31:32,074 --> 00:31:33,275
(tape whirring)

00:31:33,342 --> 00:31:35,010
BRASS:
Wait a minute.

00:31:35,077 --> 00:31:36,678
That's Jessica Jaynes'
husband, Walter.

00:31:36,745 --> 00:31:38,447
What's Dana doing with him?

00:31:38,514 --> 00:31:39,982
Beats the hell out of me.

00:31:40,048 --> 00:31:41,617
Walter's J.J.'s pimp.

00:31:41,683 --> 00:31:43,151
Your favorite word.

00:31:43,218 --> 00:31:44,553
(sighs)

00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:46,488
He all about the cash.

00:31:46,555 --> 00:31:48,056
Dude's a man-bitch.

00:31:48,123 --> 00:31:49,558
Takes care of the kid

00:31:49,625 --> 00:31:51,660
while she goes out
and makes the money.

00:31:51,727 --> 00:31:53,161
Even tattoos her waist

00:31:53,228 --> 00:31:55,497
every time
she pulls a high-roller trick.

00:31:55,564 --> 00:31:57,299
(typing, tape whirring)

00:31:57,366 --> 00:31:58,600
Another notch
on her belt, I guess.

STOKES:
I think

00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:01,970
he's got a gun on her.

00:32:02,037 --> 00:32:04,006
J.J. was after your money.

00:32:04,072 --> 00:32:06,208
Now Walter's after it,
and he's taken

00:32:06,275 --> 00:32:07,843
your girlfriend
hostage to get it.

00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:09,278
BRASS:
Where's the
money, Kellen?

00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:10,445
'Cause I'm betting that's where

00:32:10,512 --> 00:32:12,114
we're going
to find the both of them.

00:32:12,181 --> 00:32:14,049
Well, talk to my lawyers.

00:32:14,116 --> 00:32:15,884
Better yet,
talk to the tax dudes.

00:32:15,951 --> 00:32:17,186
They know where it is.

00:32:17,252 --> 00:32:19,288

Oh, come on, get
out of here, man.

like, a party?

00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:24,860
STOKES:
Okay, I'll check

00:32:24,927 --> 00:32:26,895
the outside cameras,
see if we can see

00:32:26,962 --> 00:32:28,997

I need to put a BOLO out
on Walter Jaynes.

00:32:37,639 --> 00:32:39,241
I'm gonna put
some more mayonnaise

00:32:39,308 --> 00:32:40,676
on this dry-ass sandwich.

00:34:57,958 --> 00:34:59,526
at the business manager's
apartment,

00:34:59,593 --> 00:35:02,095
and the one
from Valinda Carlisle's car

00:35:02,162 --> 00:35:03,250
were fired in the same gun.

00:35:03,317 --> 00:35:04,685
No surprises there.

00:35:04,751 --> 00:35:06,386
Yeah, but it's not the gun

00:35:06,453 --> 00:35:08,355
that was used
to kill Jessica Jaynes.

00:35:08,422 --> 00:35:11,258
I think Walter Jaynes is the one
who's on a rampage here,

00:35:11,325 --> 00:35:12,960
and he's dragging Dana Espinosa
with him.

00:35:13,026 --> 00:35:14,127
Any idea where?

00:35:14,194 --> 00:35:15,295
No. No, not yet.

00:35:15,362 --> 00:35:17,230
You might want
to work on that, Nick.

00:35:17,297 --> 00:35:20,200
We got a lead on the station
wagon that scooped up Drops.

00:35:20,267 --> 00:35:21,702
The registered owner
is Walter Jaynes.

00:35:21,768 --> 00:35:24,171
He must have had Dana
in the car with him.

00:35:24,237 --> 00:35:27,007
Walter wouldn't just let him
in the car to protect the girl.

00:35:27,074 --> 00:35:28,442
Drops must have something
he wants.

00:35:28,508 --> 00:35:30,210
The money.

00:35:30,277 --> 00:35:35,282
What we have here...
is a misunderstanding.

00:35:35,349 --> 00:35:38,919
Hmm. I understand
it just fine.

00:35:38,986 --> 00:35:41,555

Wait. Wait. Stiff you?

00:35:47,427 --> 00:35:48,829
I got busted.

00:35:48,895 --> 00:35:50,130
I went to jail.

00:35:50,197 --> 00:35:51,832
Technically, I'm still in jail.

00:35:51,898 --> 00:35:54,134
And my baby doesn't
have a mother.

00:35:54,201 --> 00:35:55,636
Neither does Dana.

00:35:55,702 --> 00:35:57,838
I'm sorry. I thought
she was gonna kill me, too.

Don't even listen
to her. Walter!

Walter, look at me!
See this here? Look.

00:36:05,012 --> 00:36:07,147
50 Gs, baby.

00:36:07,214 --> 00:36:08,482
I won't even take my cut.

00:36:08,548 --> 00:36:11,485
That's very generous.

00:36:11,551 --> 00:36:14,154
So, uh,

00:36:14,221 --> 00:36:15,255
we good to go?

00:36:15,322 --> 00:36:17,257
You owe me something else.

00:36:17,324 --> 00:36:19,559
What? The vig?

00:36:19,626 --> 00:36:21,561
What's that, 25 more?

00:36:21,628 --> 00:36:24,498
You can take the whole couch
if you want to.

00:36:24,564 --> 00:36:25,832
No, no, no, no.

00:36:25,899 --> 00:36:28,135
I got my pay.

00:36:28,201 --> 00:36:30,203
I need my payback.

00:36:32,572 --> 00:36:34,675
I lost my wife.

00:36:34,741 --> 00:36:38,378
I'm going to let you choose
which one you lose.

00:36:38,445 --> 00:36:40,447
Either your girl...

00:36:42,382 --> 00:36:44,051
...or your baby.

00:36:59,032 --> 00:37:00,167
He's definitely
at the apartment.

00:37:00,233 --> 00:37:01,835
Well, either
the jammer died, or...

00:37:01,902 --> 00:37:04,071
Yeah, or he's calling
for help.
Okay, listen up.

00:37:04,137 --> 00:37:05,372
We got a hostage situation

00:37:05,439 --> 00:37:07,140
at the Glanville apartment,
6555 Vegas Valley.

00:37:07,207 --> 00:37:08,675
We're gonna make
a silent approach.

00:37:15,782 --> 00:37:17,851
Either you choose,

00:37:17,918 --> 00:37:19,653
or I choose.

00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,721
Choose!

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:38:14,808 --> 00:38:15,809
Damn. Her water broke.

00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:17,144
Trauma from the shot.

00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:18,579
One of the victims
is a pregnant woman.

00:38:18,645 --> 00:38:20,714
She's going
into labor.

00:38:20,781 --> 00:38:22,816
That's all I got right there.

00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:24,384
Oh, the baby's coming!

00:38:24,451 --> 00:38:25,919
Just keeping breathing, Dana.

00:38:25,986 --> 00:38:27,287
Just keep breathing, okay?

Paramedics are on their way.

00:38:29,022 --> 00:38:30,223

00:39:09,129 --> 00:39:10,530
Sore.

00:39:10,597 --> 00:39:13,367
I want to hold him.

No.

00:39:17,004 --> 00:39:19,206
No?

00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:21,208
That's my son.

00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:23,210
I don't want you
to hold him, Kellen.

00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:25,445
Because of you,

00:39:25,512 --> 00:39:30,317
I heard my mother die.

00:39:30,384 --> 00:39:31,885
J.J.:
Where's the money?!
MARIA:
What money?

00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:33,620
I don't have
anything!
Drops' money!

00:39:33,687 --> 00:39:35,656
MARIA:
Who?! Just take what
you want and leave,

00:39:35,722 --> 00:39:37,124
or I'm calling
the police!

00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:40,227

DANA:
<i>I didn't even know it was J.J.</i>

00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:42,129
<i>What was I supposed to do?</i>

00:39:42,195 --> 00:39:43,630
(gun chamber cocking)

00:39:43,697 --> 00:39:45,832
I shot her and ran,
and then Valinda called.

00:39:45,899 --> 00:39:47,301
She said she heard
what happened.

00:39:47,367 --> 00:39:51,038
Said she wanted to help me.

00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,741
Thank you, Val.

00:39:54,808 --> 00:39:56,643
I am so freaked out right now.

00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:57,811
I am so sorry.

00:39:57,878 --> 00:39:59,212
DANA:
<i>Walter made Val call me.</i>

00:39:59,279 --> 00:40:00,881
<i>She was just bait.</i>

00:40:00,948 --> 00:40:02,416

(rhythmic beeping)

00:40:04,751 --> 00:40:06,853
Walter said
you owed him some money.

00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:11,425
You told me you
didn't have anything.

00:40:11,491 --> 00:40:13,427
So I took Walter to Zig-Zag,

00:40:13,493 --> 00:40:15,662
thinking he would help.

00:40:15,729 --> 00:40:19,833
And when he didn't,

00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,835
he killed him, too.

00:40:21,902 --> 00:40:23,570
And for what?

00:40:23,637 --> 00:40:25,806
So that you could hide
all the money

00:40:25,872 --> 00:40:27,441
and keep it for yourself?

00:40:27,507 --> 00:40:29,076
I had to.

00:40:29,142 --> 00:40:31,712
The tax dudes
would have taken it.

00:40:31,778 --> 00:40:35,082
And, technically,
I didn't hide it.

00:40:35,148 --> 00:40:37,117
I left it with your mother.

00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:38,385
Don't BS me, Kellen.

00:40:38,452 --> 00:40:40,821
Babe, listen,
okay, seriously.

00:40:40,887 --> 00:40:43,423
Seriously, you would
have spent it.

00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:45,058
Then, where would we be?

00:40:45,125 --> 00:40:48,028
Hmm? Hmm?

00:40:48,095 --> 00:40:50,364
That was for our future, Mommy.

00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:52,466
We don't have a future.

00:40:54,067 --> 00:40:57,404
When you get out, we'll be gone.

00:40:57,471 --> 00:40:59,273
You can't do that.

00:40:59,339 --> 00:41:02,843
We're not married,
and you're a convict.

00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:04,912
I can do what I want.

00:41:07,314 --> 00:41:09,249
STOKES:
Okay, Drops,
that's it.

00:41:09,316 --> 00:41:10,417
Time to go, man.

00:41:10,484 --> 00:41:11,885
We got to get you transferred

00:41:11,952 --> 00:41:14,254
back to the prison
hospital, okay?

00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:25,532
Is Dana gonna do any time
for offing J.J.?

00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:27,034
Oh, I doubt it.

00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,770
Sounds like a
pretty good case of
self-defense to me.

00:41:29,836 --> 00:41:31,038
What about the money?

00:41:31,104 --> 00:41:32,806
I'm not expecting anything.
Just wondering.

00:41:32,873 --> 00:41:34,341
Well, technically,
it's the mother's.

00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:35,842
It was her apartment.

00:41:35,909 --> 00:41:38,278
Dana's the only beneficiary,
so the money's really hers.

00:41:38,345 --> 00:41:41,748
And my kid's.
Yeah.

00:41:41,815 --> 00:41:44,418
For once, I did something
good in my life.

00:41:44,484 --> 00:41:47,387
Oh, your life ain't
over yet, Kellen.

00:41:47,454 --> 00:41:49,990
It ain't over yet.
