00:00:08,086 --> 00:00:10,455

00:00:10,522 --> 00:00:15,293
(loud music playing)

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,297
(yelling and laughing)

00:00:19,364 --> 00:00:23,001
Hey, bro, I'm driving drunk,
and you're lighting up a J?

00:00:23,068 --> 00:00:26,237
Maybe we should wait
for those... hell, dude.

00:00:26,304 --> 00:00:29,107
Man, we're in Vegas.

00:00:29,174 --> 00:00:30,742
Sweet potato Vegas!

00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:32,310
Whoo!

00:00:32,377 --> 00:00:36,915
(loud music continuing)

00:00:38,183 --> 00:00:44,089

00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,227

00:00:49,294 --> 00:00:51,930
(sirens blaring)

00:00:54,699 --> 00:00:57,535
Hide that!
Hide it! Hide it!

00:00:57,602 --> 00:00:59,704
Get it out of here!

00:00:59,771 --> 00:01:03,875
(sirens blaring)

00:01:03,942 --> 00:01:07,345
Hey, hide that liquor!
Hide the liquor! Hide it!

00:01:07,412 --> 00:01:09,080
Throw that joint out!

00:01:11,049 --> 00:01:13,585
Get him! Get him!

00:01:13,652 --> 00:01:15,720
Shoot him! Shoot him!

00:01:19,591 --> 00:01:25,530
(sirens blaring)

00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:47,118

00:02:18,216 --> 00:02:20,919

(sirens blaring)

00:02:26,124 --> 00:02:27,859
Get out of the way!

00:02:50,048 --> 00:02:53,652
(phone ringing)

00:02:56,755 --> 00:02:58,089
Hello?

00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:00,425
Hello?

00:03:02,394 --> 00:03:06,465
Unknown caller. No call list.

00:03:06,532 --> 00:03:09,835
Probably disposable.

00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:25,350
Where's Warrick?

00:03:25,417 --> 00:03:27,686
We've been calling him. 
There's no answer.

00:03:27,753 --> 00:03:28,821
BRASS:
See what happens
when you get in

00:03:28,887 --> 00:03:30,489
a high-speed chase
with a garbage truck

00:03:30,556 --> 00:03:32,057
and end up with <i>two</i> dead bodies.

00:03:32,124 --> 00:03:34,526
Where's the other one?

00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:39,531
I take it
he came out of the truck?

00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:40,833
He <i>flew</i> out.

00:03:40,899 --> 00:03:42,434
At least that's what
every eyewitness tells us.

00:03:42,501 --> 00:03:45,370
WILLOWS:
Well, city landfill is a couple
of miles down the road.

00:03:45,437 --> 00:03:47,172
What's the TOD, David?

00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:48,240
Nine, maybe ten, hours.

00:03:48,307 --> 00:03:49,875
I got no ID on
either of the bodies.

00:03:49,942 --> 00:03:51,243
No ID on the truck.

00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,644
I ran the VIN number
and the plates.

00:03:52,711 --> 00:03:54,446
They're not
in the system.

00:03:54,513 --> 00:03:55,948
Good luck.

00:03:56,014 --> 00:03:57,382
Control Sanitation

00:03:57,449 --> 00:03:59,418
is the only waste company
in Vegas.

00:03:59,485 --> 00:04:00,953
If the garbageman works
for them, his prints

00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:02,354
would be in
the system.

00:04:02,421 --> 00:04:04,089
All right. Catherine,
you and I got the bodies.

00:04:04,156 --> 00:04:06,458
Greg, since Warrick's MIA,
you have a choice:

00:04:06,525 --> 00:04:08,127
the truck or the trail.

00:04:08,193 --> 00:04:10,529
I'll go for the fresh air.

00:04:10,596 --> 00:04:12,030
Do I get
a choice, too?

00:04:12,097 --> 00:04:13,398
Because, if you don't mind,

00:04:13,465 --> 00:04:15,100
I'm going to take
the garbageman.

00:04:15,167 --> 00:04:16,668
Be my guest.

00:04:19,471 --> 00:04:21,840
I thought I told you
not to call me on this line.

00:04:21,907 --> 00:04:25,544
Maybe that's because
I don't want to talk to you.

00:04:25,611 --> 00:04:27,412
Are you kidding me?

00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:31,283
Why don't you ask the father
of your unborn child?

00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:33,452
No. That's stupid.
Don't call the lawyers.

00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:36,455
Tina, don't call... Tina! Tina!

00:04:36,522 --> 00:04:39,224
Don't call... Tina!

00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:40,859
Damn it.

00:04:48,734 --> 00:04:51,136
Hey, Gris, I'm sorry I'm late.

00:04:51,203 --> 00:04:52,604
I had some business
to take care of.

00:04:52,671 --> 00:04:54,239
This <i>is</i> your business.

00:04:54,306 --> 00:04:55,741
You were first up.

00:04:55,808 --> 00:04:57,876
That means you're supposed
to be here first.

00:04:57,943 --> 00:04:59,878
You get to process
the trash truck.

00:04:59,945 --> 00:05:01,647
No problem.

00:05:01,713 --> 00:05:03,148
But get it off the street.

00:05:03,215 --> 00:05:05,217
Tow it to the impound yard.

00:05:12,257 --> 00:05:15,828



00:05:15,894 --> 00:05:19,064

Your garbageman


00:06:00,339 --> 00:06:01,474
was in excellent shape.


00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:03,075
COD is as expected.


00:06:03,142 --> 00:06:07,246
Massive BFT due to his
unfortunate collision
with the T-bird.


00:06:07,313 --> 00:06:09,649
And your other vic
was in his late 20s.


00:06:09,715 --> 00:06:12,385
He was definitely
crushed by something.


00:06:12,451 --> 00:06:14,720
Most likely,
the garbage compactor.


00:06:14,787 --> 00:06:16,822
Which happened postmortem.


00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:19,792
Oh, it's always better
to be compacted dead
rather than alive.


00:06:26,832 --> 00:06:28,501
WILLOWS:
<i>What's his COD?</i>


00:06:28,568 --> 00:06:31,270
Suffocation. He had
petechial hemorrhaging.


00:06:31,337 --> 00:06:34,073
I found white fibers
in the nose and mouth.


00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,408
Sent them
over to Hodges.


00:06:35,474 --> 00:06:37,410
He called back,
confirmed they were silk.


00:06:37,476 --> 00:06:39,312
I tried to trace
garbageman's cell phone.


00:06:39,378 --> 00:06:41,147
Like we expected,
it's disposable.


00:06:41,214 --> 00:06:42,715
So I tracked down
the distributor.


00:06:42,782 --> 00:06:45,017
It was paid for in cash
under a bogus name.


00:06:45,084 --> 00:06:48,354
But I did get an AFIS hit
off his print.


00:06:48,421 --> 00:06:50,690
Brody Biggs. Former cop.


00:06:50,756 --> 00:06:52,258
GRISSOM:
When was this taken?


00:06:52,325 --> 00:06:54,727
1975, police academy graduation.


00:06:54,794 --> 00:06:57,630
I contacted LVPD.
They said he quit the force


00:06:57,697 --> 00:07:00,032
back in 1980
with a perfect record.


00:07:00,099 --> 00:07:01,367
Then what?


00:07:01,434 --> 00:07:03,936
Social came back to several
different garages around town.


00:07:04,003 --> 00:07:05,872
He was a freelance mechanic
for 20 years.


00:07:05,938 --> 00:07:08,040
All right, we got to get
his personnel file.


00:07:08,107 --> 00:07:09,208
What about the other vic?


00:07:09,275 --> 00:07:11,277
(typing)
It's Jason Crewes.


00:07:11,344 --> 00:07:13,546
27. Got a hit
off his work card.


00:07:13,613 --> 00:07:15,248
He's worked at five
different casinos


00:07:15,314 --> 00:07:17,517
over the last six years.


00:07:22,822 --> 00:07:26,392
Well, it doesn't look like
Jason planned on going anywhere.


00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:29,462
I know a lot of people
in this phone.


00:07:29,529 --> 00:07:32,031
You do not.


00:07:32,098 --> 00:07:34,800
Knows some
famous people.


00:07:34,867 --> 00:07:39,005

Would have been incinerated.

We talked at about 3:00

He said he got off work early
and was going to bed,

00:10:23,069 --> 00:10:25,638
and he'd call me
when he woke up.

00:10:25,705 --> 00:10:29,375
But he never did.

Have you ever seen this man?

His name is Brody Biggs.
He's a mechanic.

Are you sure?

If he's a mechanic,

00:10:41,921 --> 00:10:44,390
maybe he worked
on some of Jason's limos.

00:10:44,457 --> 00:10:46,526
I thought Jason
was a club owner.

00:10:46,592 --> 00:10:49,662
He was a limo driver
before that, long time ago.

00:10:49,729 --> 00:10:52,632
Well, couldn't be
that long ago.

00:10:52,698 --> 00:10:55,167
Jason was only 27.

00:10:55,234 --> 00:10:59,038
You have to be 25
to be a limo driver.

00:10:59,105 --> 00:11:01,207
He had all kinds of fake IDs.

00:11:01,274 --> 00:11:04,210
Drove his first
long one at 18.

00:11:04,277 --> 00:11:08,047
The owner of the limo
company liked Jason.

00:11:08,114 --> 00:11:10,883
Made him a VIP driver.

00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:13,052
Celebs liked Jason.

00:11:13,119 --> 00:11:15,888
He could take his clients
to a Motel 6

00:11:15,955 --> 00:11:18,524
and it'd be
the hottest spot in town.

00:11:18,591 --> 00:11:22,128
Wasn't long before the club
owners invested in Jason,

00:11:22,195 --> 00:11:26,933
made him a group partner,
gave him his own spot.

00:11:26,999 --> 00:11:29,669
Then two, then five.

00:11:29,735 --> 00:11:32,572
Suddenly, he's running
the whole club scene.

00:11:35,908 --> 00:11:40,646
I guess I should say
he <i>ran</i> the club scene.

00:11:40,713 --> 00:11:44,750
He's not going to be running
anything anymore.

Hey, Gris, listen.
About me being late...

00:12:12,512 --> 00:12:14,647
You have a cell phone

00:12:14,714 --> 00:12:16,983
You call, you say
you're running late.

00:12:17,049 --> 00:12:19,485
What's going on

00:12:19,552 --> 00:12:21,153
I don't know. This, uh...

00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,689
This whole divorce has taken
the wind out of my sails.

00:12:23,756 --> 00:12:26,692
You know, I used
to have the team

00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:28,194
to distract me from all this,

00:12:28,261 --> 00:12:30,730
but even that's changed
with Sara being gone.

00:12:30,796 --> 00:12:32,498
I feel kind of disconnected.

00:12:32,565 --> 00:12:34,233
You've got your work.

00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,369
Don't screw that up.

Van Halen, <i>1984.</i>

00:12:59,692 --> 00:13:01,961
Either this truck was
delivering merchandise

00:13:02,028 --> 00:13:05,031
for a memorabilia store
or it's just plain old.

00:13:05,097 --> 00:13:07,533
Maybe that's why Brass
couldn't find the
registration record.

00:13:10,336 --> 00:13:14,507
These old blue license plates
were issued in the '80s.

00:13:14,574 --> 00:13:17,543
I don't think this truck's
been on the streets since.

00:13:49,175 --> 00:13:51,777
I think this guy was
disguising his truck.

00:13:51,844 --> 00:13:55,147
It was orange
before it was green.

00:13:55,214 --> 00:13:57,817
They used to use orange
garbage trucks in the '80s.

00:13:57,884 --> 00:14:00,453

cylinder blew.

<i>Maybe when he crushed the body.</i>

00:14:05,191 --> 00:14:08,427
<i>That's why all</i>

00:14:13,332 --> 00:14:15,034
Shorts.

00:14:15,101 --> 00:14:16,335
Usually used
for shooting small animals,

00:14:16,402 --> 00:14:18,237
but in some cases
they're used on people

00:14:18,304 --> 00:14:19,438
in place of a silencer.

00:14:19,505 --> 00:14:20,840
GRISSOM:
<i>Less gunpowder, less noise.</i>

00:14:20,907 --> 00:14:22,375
BROWN:
<i>Look, if the garbageman</i>
<i>had this gun,</i>

00:14:22,441 --> 00:14:24,210
why didn't he just
shoot the vic?

00:14:24,277 --> 00:14:25,711
GRISSOM:
He found Jason sleeping.

00:14:25,778 --> 00:14:27,446
Why make a mess
if you don't have to?

00:14:27,513 --> 00:14:28,614
Sounds like a
professional hit man.

00:14:28,681 --> 00:14:29,815
GRISSOM:
Well, if he was,

00:14:29,882 --> 00:14:33,152
we still have to find
the guy who hired him.

00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:39,892
BROWN:
I traced the VIN on the garbage
truck back to The Regency,

00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:41,060
the company that made it.

00:14:41,127 --> 00:14:43,095
The only model of that truck
sold in Nevada

00:14:43,162 --> 00:14:45,932
was to a company called
The Regal Sanitation Group.

00:14:45,998 --> 00:14:47,867
They shut down in '83.

00:14:47,934 --> 00:14:49,869
GRISSOM:
That explains the garbage.

00:14:49,936 --> 00:14:53,105
SANDERS:
Regal Sanitation was owned
by Anthony Pezzulo.

00:14:53,172 --> 00:14:55,792
I'm studying mob history
for my book.

00:14:55,859 --> 00:14:59,463
Pezzulo? Wasn't he the mob boss
who owned the Starfly?

00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,160
SANDERS:
<i>They called Pezzulo "Whacko,"</i>

00:15:02,227 --> 00:15:04,329
<i>not so much for his</i>
<i>wacky personality</i>

00:15:04,395 --> 00:15:06,064
as for his love
for whacking guys.

00:15:06,131 --> 00:15:08,933
GRISSOM:
<i>Until he himself</i>

00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,269
got whacked at
the Wisconsin Dells in 1983.

00:15:11,336 --> 00:15:13,938
Every mob-owned business
in Vegas shut down

00:15:14,005 --> 00:15:16,040
when Pezzulo died.

00:15:16,107 --> 00:15:17,175
These scumbags lay roaches.

00:15:17,242 --> 00:15:18,543
Just when you think
they're gone,

00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:19,677
they pop back up again.

00:15:19,744 --> 00:15:23,014
Somebody put a hit
out on Jason.

00:15:23,081 --> 00:15:24,282
It couldn't have been Pezzulo

00:15:24,349 --> 00:15:25,750
'cause he's been dead
for 20 years.

00:15:25,817 --> 00:15:27,852
Pezzulo's wife Kate got rid
of Regal Sanitation

00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:29,187
right after he died.

00:15:29,254 --> 00:15:30,388
She still around?

00:15:30,455 --> 00:15:32,123
She fell off the radar.

00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:34,959
All I could find
was this old photo.

00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,695
WOMAN:
<i>I told you the truth.</i>

00:15:37,762 --> 00:15:39,097
You lied about your name.

00:15:39,164 --> 00:15:42,233
The feds told me to forget
I ever had the Pezzulo name.

00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:45,804
I wasn't about
to remember it for you.

00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:49,274
My husband had more cops
than capos on his payroll.

00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,309
So you went into
witness protection.

00:15:51,376 --> 00:15:53,044
You changed your identity.

00:15:53,111 --> 00:15:54,379
And then you stayed
in Vegas?

00:15:54,446 --> 00:15:57,248
Feds felt we'd actually
be safer here.

00:15:57,315 --> 00:15:59,451
They thought if we left,
we might

00:15:59,517 --> 00:16:03,154
suffer the same consequences
as Anthony.

00:16:03,221 --> 00:16:06,157
BRASS:
Did Jason have any mob ties?

00:16:06,224 --> 00:16:11,529
Jason was three years old
when Anthony died.

00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:13,932
He never even knew his father.

00:16:13,998 --> 00:16:19,003
The last time we talked you said
you didn't know Jason's killer.

00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:21,139
What about this guy?

00:16:26,711 --> 00:16:28,146
That's B.B.

00:16:28,213 --> 00:16:29,981
That's the same guy.

00:16:30,048 --> 00:16:33,852
B.B. is short for Brody Biggs.

00:16:33,918 --> 00:16:36,254
B.B. didn't kill Jason.

00:16:36,321 --> 00:16:38,189
There's no way.

00:16:38,256 --> 00:16:40,291
He was Anthony's friend.

00:16:40,358 --> 00:16:44,529
Friend?

00:16:44,596 --> 00:16:48,733
B.B. was driving one of your
husband's old garbage trucks.

00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,137
Your dead son was in the back
with the rest of the garbage.

00:16:52,203 --> 00:16:54,739
How did B.B.
get the truck?

00:17:00,545 --> 00:17:03,648
I haven't seen B.B. in 23 years.

00:17:03,715 --> 00:17:05,717
You got rid
of the business.

00:17:05,784 --> 00:17:08,253
What happened
to the trucks?

00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,922
I gave that stuff to Lou Gedda.

00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:14,325
The owner of
Pigalle Boulevard
Strip Club.

00:17:14,392 --> 00:17:16,127
So did Gedda and B.B.
know each other?

00:17:16,194 --> 00:17:20,331
Of course, they were both
on Anthony's crew,

00:17:20,398 --> 00:17:22,033
but they would never...

00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,535
Never what?

00:17:23,601 --> 00:17:25,603
Never kill your son

00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:28,573
and dispose of him in one
of the trucks you gave him?

00:17:33,478 --> 00:17:37,081
When was the last time
you saw Gedda?

00:17:37,148 --> 00:17:38,683
(sniffles)

00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:43,354
I haven't had any contact
with him since Anthony died.

00:17:43,421 --> 00:17:44,756
So you're telling me

00:17:44,823 --> 00:17:47,459
you haven't seen or spoken
to Lou Gedda in 23 years?

00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:53,331
Gedda and I had an agreement.

00:17:53,398 --> 00:17:58,236
He was to keep away
from our family.

00:17:58,303 --> 00:18:02,240
Forget Jason and I ever existed.

00:18:04,609 --> 00:18:07,879
Obviously, Lou Gedda is not
a man of his word.

00:18:23,361 --> 00:18:25,230
This place has always
been bad news.

00:18:25,296 --> 00:18:27,999
My guys are in here
at least twice a week.

00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:29,400
Yet there's always a line.

00:18:29,467 --> 00:18:31,336
Never underestimate
the power of the ass.

00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:32,470
Look out. Coming through.

00:18:32,537 --> 00:18:35,273
Excuse me, gentlemen.

00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:39,878
(rhythm and blues playing)

00:19:12,544 --> 00:19:14,779
Looking for Lou Gedda.

00:19:36,468 --> 00:19:38,603
MAN:
Yeah, come on in.

00:19:41,739 --> 00:19:45,176
Who let you two up here?

00:19:45,243 --> 00:19:46,711
Just so I know
who to fire.

00:19:46,778 --> 00:19:49,247
Gold card.

00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:54,452
Oh, yeah, those seem
to work everywhere.

00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:56,054
Got to get me one.

00:19:56,121 --> 00:19:57,388
Ahh...!

00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:02,360
I know why you're here.

00:20:02,427 --> 00:20:04,395
And I don't know
what to say.

00:20:04,462 --> 00:20:06,164
I can't control these girls.

00:20:06,231 --> 00:20:08,066
They want to leave
with customers

00:20:08,133 --> 00:20:10,068
and do whatever it is
they do, I can't prevent that.

00:20:10,135 --> 00:20:13,004
Believe me,
I don't like whores.

00:20:13,071 --> 00:20:15,173
I like dancers.

00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,042
When I find out they're whores,
I kick them curbside.

00:20:18,109 --> 00:20:19,878
We're not here
about your girls.

00:20:19,944 --> 00:20:21,212
We're here about this guy.

00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:23,314
B.B.

00:20:23,381 --> 00:20:26,117
Yeah, works
at my auto detailing.

00:20:26,184 --> 00:20:28,319
But I tell ya,
he's in here more,

00:20:28,386 --> 00:20:31,189
getting drunk and checking out
the breast-est-es.

00:20:31,256 --> 00:20:33,391
Well, you don't have
to worry about him
anymore. He's dead.

00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:36,895
Oh. Well...

00:20:36,961 --> 00:20:38,797
unless you invite me
to the funeral,

00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:40,331
what's this got
to do with me?

00:20:40,398 --> 00:20:41,733
Tell me about
Jason Crewes.

00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,802
He brings me boatloads
of celebrities,

00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:45,437
which equals
boatloads of money.

00:20:45,503 --> 00:20:47,839
I love the kid.

00:20:47,906 --> 00:20:50,041
Oh, don't tell me.

00:20:50,108 --> 00:20:51,342
You think Jason killed B.B.?

00:20:51,409 --> 00:20:54,679
We think B.B. killed Jason.

00:20:54,746 --> 00:20:58,183
Now, see, that
makes more sense.

00:20:58,249 --> 00:21:00,718
When is the last time
you saw Jason Crewes, sir?

00:21:00,785 --> 00:21:01,920
Last week.

00:21:01,986 --> 00:21:03,354
How long have
you known him?

00:21:03,421 --> 00:21:04,956
A couple years at most.

00:21:05,023 --> 00:21:07,292
I still don't understand
what this has to do with me.

00:21:07,358 --> 00:21:09,194
You missing a garbage truck?

00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,462
Go again?

00:21:10,528 --> 00:21:12,097
Regal Sanitation Group.

00:21:12,163 --> 00:21:13,965
Your buddy Pezzulo's
old company.

00:21:14,032 --> 00:21:15,567
You inherited
the trucks.

00:21:15,633 --> 00:21:17,168
So what?

00:21:17,235 --> 00:21:19,404
Jason Crewes' corpse flew
out of one of your trucks

00:21:19,471 --> 00:21:20,638
earlier this morning.

00:21:20,705 --> 00:21:22,507
Do you know how much this club
made last year?

00:21:22,574 --> 00:21:23,808
30 mill.

00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,543
You think I'm still messing
around with trash?

00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:27,545
And that's
the end of this.

00:21:27,612 --> 00:21:30,048
You want to continue
asking me questions,

00:21:30,115 --> 00:21:33,118
you're going to have to do it
with my dream team present.

00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:11,459
BROWN:
Here you go.

00:22:11,525 --> 00:22:13,094
Thank you.

00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,795
So you're the talented
Mr. Raykirk,

00:22:14,862 --> 00:22:16,333
agent to the stars.

00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:16,834
Uh-uh, manager.

00:22:16,901 --> 00:22:18,169
What's
the difference?

00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:20,972
Uh, well, an agent
gets ten percent

00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:22,306
and a manager gets 15.

00:22:22,373 --> 00:22:25,143
Listen, I'm here in town
for a film festival

00:22:25,209 --> 00:22:26,878
and I have to get
to a screening,

00:22:26,944 --> 00:22:29,647
so you can you just, you know,
cut to the chase?

00:22:31,215 --> 00:22:33,551
Jason Crewes is dead.

00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:37,889
Okay.

00:22:40,391 --> 00:22:42,660
Um...
So he took you

00:22:42,727 --> 00:22:45,630
to Pigalle Boulevard in August.

00:22:45,696 --> 00:22:46,764
Do you remember that?

00:22:46,831 --> 00:22:48,232
How do you know about that?

00:22:48,299 --> 00:22:49,801
I'm an investigator.

00:22:49,867 --> 00:22:52,403
Some things I do know, but
there's a lot that I don't.

00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:54,672
Somebody put a hit
out on your friend.

00:22:54,739 --> 00:22:55,907
You want to help us
out here?

00:22:55,973 --> 00:22:58,776
I have an agent friend
who I work with

00:22:58,843 --> 00:23:00,278
who had a bachelor party
out here,

00:23:00,344 --> 00:23:03,047
and Jason hooked us up
VIP-style.

00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:10,288
<i>He took us to Moon</i>
<i>and LAX and Drai's</i>

00:23:10,354 --> 00:23:12,890
<i>and then of course, naturally,</i>
<i>we ended up at a strip club.</i>

00:23:12,957 --> 00:23:16,828
<i>And everyone knows the best</i>
<i>girls are at Pigalle Boulevard.</i>

00:23:19,764 --> 00:23:24,302
<i>It couldn't get any better</i>
<i>until the check showed up.</i>

00:23:24,368 --> 00:23:25,603
Ten grand?

00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:26,838
The manager said $800 a bottle.

00:23:26,904 --> 00:23:28,072
We ordered five.

00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,843
I hear you don't want
to pay what you owe us.

00:23:31,909 --> 00:23:33,578
No. No, no, no, no.

00:23:33,644 --> 00:23:35,480
I just think
you overcharged us, man.

00:23:35,546 --> 00:23:36,681
No.

00:23:39,116 --> 00:23:40,485
This place is a rip-off.

00:23:40,551 --> 00:23:41,619
And your girls?

00:23:41,686 --> 00:23:45,490
They're beat, overrated,
and oversized.

00:23:45,556 --> 00:23:46,557
Get it?

00:23:46,624 --> 00:23:48,459
I'm not paying.

00:23:48,526 --> 00:23:50,528
Let's take a walk.

00:24:01,672 --> 00:24:02,840
I'm gonna give you
a minute

00:24:02,907 --> 00:24:05,743
so you can figure out
what you want to do.

00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:08,346
I'm cutting something.

00:24:08,412 --> 00:24:10,414
But I'm gonna give you the
choice of what it's gonna be.

00:24:10,481 --> 00:24:11,549
No.
Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:13,384
I can slice you here

00:24:13,451 --> 00:24:14,819
or I can slice you here.

00:24:14,886 --> 00:24:16,387
(sobbing)
Come on, no, no, no.

00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:17,989
Shh, shh, shh.
Shh, shh, shh.

00:24:18,055 --> 00:24:19,590
Come on, you choose.

00:24:19,657 --> 00:24:21,793
I mean, I was never
more scared in my life.

00:24:21,859 --> 00:24:23,694
You know, he was so sweet enough
to give me the choice

00:24:23,761 --> 00:24:26,597
of my throat or my genitals,
so I chose the latter...

00:24:26,664 --> 00:24:28,099
so I'd live.

00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:29,467
Then he charged my card

00:24:29,534 --> 00:24:31,636
and escorted us out
to the parking lot.

00:24:31,702 --> 00:24:33,471
Oh, here's something
really cool.

00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:35,940
I left with a broken nose,
some sore wrists,

00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:38,943
and some really nice bruises
underneath my arms.

00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:40,945
And I just should've given him
the ten grand

00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:42,780
because I paid
my plastic surgeon twice that.

00:24:42,847 --> 00:24:44,782
And you told Jason
about all this?

00:24:44,849 --> 00:24:46,250
Oh, yeah.

00:24:46,317 --> 00:24:49,320
I mean, he gave this guy Gedda
a call right in front of me.

00:24:49,387 --> 00:24:50,822
Then he cursed him out

00:24:50,888 --> 00:24:54,826
and he told him he would never
take anyone to Pigalle anymore.

00:24:54,892 --> 00:24:58,196
Listen, I'm really sorry
about all this.

00:24:58,262 --> 00:25:01,532
But, um, thanks
a lot for your time.
Oh, yeah.

00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:03,734
By the way, if you're
gonna prosecute this guy,

00:25:03,801 --> 00:25:05,703
I'm not a witness.

00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:07,572
There's a reason that
I didn't press charges,

00:25:07,638 --> 00:25:09,140
if you know what I mean.

00:25:30,394 --> 00:25:31,629
Four shots.

Got an IBIS hit
off that gun.

00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:07,999
Unsolved murder in '93.

00:26:08,065 --> 00:26:09,300
Victim was found
in the desert.

00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:10,902
His car was found
at Pigalle Boulevard,

00:26:10,968 --> 00:26:12,370
the last place
anyone saw him.

00:26:12,436 --> 00:26:14,138
GRISSOM:
Our hit man's good
for two murders.

00:26:14,205 --> 00:26:16,474
The unsolved in '93,
where he actually used a gun,

00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:18,943
and Jason Crewes,
who he suffocated.

00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,411
So, who hired him?

00:26:20,478 --> 00:26:22,380
I have a good feeling
he works for Gedda.

00:26:22,446 --> 00:26:24,448
Yeah, but we don't work
off feelings, do we?

00:26:24,515 --> 00:26:27,485
According to Mr. Hollywood,
Jason cost Gedda a lot of money,

00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:29,287
and he dissed him,
which is more than enough

00:26:29,353 --> 00:26:31,222
for Gedda to order out
a hit on someone,

00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:33,057
even if Jason
is Pezzulo's son.

00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:34,225
Any evidence?

00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:36,260
I ran Pigalle's address
to find out

00:26:36,327 --> 00:26:38,329
if there are any more crimes
linked to it over the years.

00:26:38,396 --> 00:26:41,165
I found hundreds:
416s, 413s, 411s...

00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:43,234
The list goes on.

00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:44,202
Any consistent suspects?

00:26:44,268 --> 00:26:45,369
Only thing consistent

00:26:45,436 --> 00:26:47,104
is that the victims refused
to file charges

00:26:47,171 --> 00:26:48,940
and the witnesses refused
to give statements.

00:26:49,006 --> 00:26:52,243
And it's funny enough the cops
lost interest in pursuing it.

00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:54,078
What are you saying?

00:26:54,145 --> 00:26:55,413
I'm saying it looks like Gedda

00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,914
is running an old school
extortion racket,

00:26:56,981 --> 00:26:59,650

having cops on the payroll.
