BRASS:
Guy in a boat spotted him
this morning.

00:01:10,585 --> 00:01:11,853
No witnesses.

00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,889
STOKES:
How did he get up there?

00:01:16,425 --> 00:01:18,627
I think maybe somebody
gave him a lift.

00:01:18,694 --> 00:01:20,796
Okay, Super, I'm ready to cut.

00:01:25,534 --> 00:01:27,235
(grunts)

00:01:27,302 --> 00:01:30,439
Lacerations to his chest.

00:01:31,873 --> 00:01:33,475
Stabbed and then hanged.

00:01:33,542 --> 00:01:36,578
I guess he wasn't
dead enough.

00:01:36,645 --> 00:01:40,248
Rope burns
on both palms.

00:01:40,315 --> 00:01:41,783
He probably tried
to pull himself up.

00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,318
Lift his shirt up,
will you, David?

00:01:45,821 --> 00:01:47,723
Whoa!

00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:51,259
PHILLIPS:
I... thought this...
guy was a guy.

00:01:51,326 --> 00:01:52,527
Check the plumping.

00:01:53,562 --> 00:01:54,830
Full male genitalia.

00:01:54,896 --> 00:01:58,467
Mutilated tranny strung up
in a tree.

00:01:58,533 --> 00:02:02,170
(yelling and screaming)

00:02:02,237 --> 00:02:03,672
MAN:
Go! Go! Go! Go!

00:02:03,739 --> 00:02:06,808

suffocation from hanging.

00:03:53,655 --> 00:03:55,524
GRISSOM:
18 years old.

00:03:55,591 --> 00:03:56,325
(camera shutter clicking)

00:03:56,391 --> 00:03:58,327
Brian Towne.

00:03:58,393 --> 00:04:00,262
Lived in Verdant Glen.

00:04:00,329 --> 00:04:03,699
Hmm. 20 years ago, my wife
wanted to buy out there,

00:04:03,765 --> 00:04:06,435
but there was no 215 freeway
back then.

00:04:06,502 --> 00:04:07,836
The commute
would've killed me.

00:04:07,903 --> 00:04:10,606
No physical signs
of Klinefelter syndrome.

00:04:10,672 --> 00:04:12,441
So he's not an XXY.

00:04:12,508 --> 00:04:15,177
ROBBINS:
No, he's all skin and muscle.

00:04:15,244 --> 00:04:16,945
These can't be fatty deposits...

00:04:17,012 --> 00:04:19,681
This is glandular tissue.

00:04:19,748 --> 00:04:22,050
His mammaries are swollen.

00:04:22,117 --> 00:04:23,785
Gynecomastia.

00:04:23,852 --> 00:04:26,655
Pre-op transsexuals
take a lot of estrogen.

00:04:26,722 --> 00:04:28,957
I'll run
an expanded tox panel,

00:04:29,024 --> 00:04:31,260
send out
for a hormone screen.

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,134
LILY:
It wasn't easy
being a Copa girl.

00:04:39,201 --> 00:04:41,770
When the curtain came down,

00:04:41,837 --> 00:04:44,573
we had to stay and decorate
the Sands Casino

00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,741
into the wee hours.

00:04:45,807 --> 00:04:47,743
Ugly guys do gamble more

00:04:47,809 --> 00:04:49,912
when there's pretty girls
to look at.

00:04:49,978 --> 00:04:51,580
They weren't all ugly.

00:04:51,647 --> 00:04:55,417
And your father,
in that tuxedo...

00:04:55,484 --> 00:04:57,386
giving me the eye,

00:04:57,452 --> 00:04:59,121
trying not to grin,

00:04:59,188 --> 00:05:02,391
'cause he thought floor managers
had to be tough.

00:05:02,457 --> 00:05:03,725
So, Mom,
who made the first move?

00:05:03,792 --> 00:05:06,061
Sam.

00:05:06,128 --> 00:05:09,198
Stuck this five-dollar chip
in my hand

00:05:09,264 --> 00:05:11,200
and said, "Take it,

00:05:11,266 --> 00:05:13,735
you can't miss."

00:05:13,802 --> 00:05:16,772
I shot craps all night with
Peter Lawford and cleaned up.

00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:21,743
I was right here the day
Sam opened the Rampart,

00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:24,446
his first casino.

00:05:25,447 --> 00:05:26,582
(crowd cheers)

00:05:26,648 --> 00:05:28,350
<i>And we were going to be</i>
<i>right here again</i>

00:05:28,417 --> 00:05:30,519
<i>when he opened the Eclipse.</i>

00:05:30,586 --> 00:05:33,956
I know you wanted
to be buried with this,

00:05:34,022 --> 00:05:37,226
but I just couldn't let go.

00:05:37,292 --> 00:05:39,127
I can now.

00:05:40,796 --> 00:05:44,166
They're going to build
your dream on it, honey.

00:05:46,635 --> 00:05:48,937
Take it.

00:05:49,004 --> 00:05:50,672
You can't miss.

00:05:57,346 --> 00:05:59,147
(car horns honking)

00:05:59,214 --> 00:06:00,682

00:06:16,298 --> 00:06:18,333

Jimmy Louise Hoffa.

FOREMAN:
I want you to grab
that jackhammer

00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:20,375

00:06:20,442 --> 00:06:21,876
Supervisor Willows

00:06:21,943 --> 00:06:23,645

Worker found a body.

MAN:
I'm just following protocol.

00:06:24,813 --> 00:06:26,147
You find a body,

00:06:26,214 --> 00:06:27,549
call you guys.

00:06:27,616 --> 00:06:29,050
Yeah.
How do you know

00:06:29,117 --> 00:06:30,585
this is one
of the Marquis Chimps?

00:06:30,652 --> 00:06:34,656
'Cause they played the Frontier
in Ronald Reagan's act.

00:06:34,723 --> 00:06:38,326
<i>And</i> only humans
have a saddle joint.

00:06:38,393 --> 00:06:40,595
In fact, that's how
we were able to swing

00:06:40,662 --> 00:06:42,297
out of trees and end up here.

00:06:42,364 --> 00:06:43,765
Opposable thumbs.

00:06:43,832 --> 00:06:46,534
Well, these casinos weren't
built by saints, you know.

00:06:46,601 --> 00:06:48,403
Oh, I know.

00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:49,838
My dad built this one.

00:06:49,905 --> 00:06:51,606
(keypad beeps)

00:06:51,673 --> 00:06:52,807
MAN (on phone):
Las Vegas Crime Lab.

00:06:52,874 --> 00:06:54,276
Yeah, this is CSI Willows.

00:06:54,342 --> 00:06:58,013
I need to hand a case off
to Swing.

00:06:58,079 --> 00:06:59,948

I want to know who did this.

00:07:53,635 --> 00:07:56,137
Well, that's what we're
trying to find out.

00:07:56,204 --> 00:07:59,074
Mrs. Towne, it
would be of help
if you could tell me

00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,977
a little bit more
about your son Brian.

00:08:02,043 --> 00:08:08,116
He was kind... and sweet

00:08:08,183 --> 00:08:11,019
and... didn't have
an enemy in the world.

00:08:11,086 --> 00:08:13,188
What about friends?
Not really.

00:08:13,255 --> 00:08:15,991
He was always so busy
putting in overtime

00:08:16,057 --> 00:08:18,393
down at the...
water treatment plant.

00:08:20,195 --> 00:08:22,597
He loved to take long runs.

00:08:22,664 --> 00:08:25,333
Exercise is a natural cure
for depression.

00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,335
Was he depressed?

00:08:27,402 --> 00:08:28,937
I mean, there's a lot
of medications here.

00:08:29,004 --> 00:08:30,739
Are these Brian's?

00:08:30,805 --> 00:08:31,840
No. These are all mine.

00:08:31,907 --> 00:08:35,010
I had a mastectomy
eight years ago.

00:08:35,076 --> 00:08:37,112
Cancer came back
three months ago.

00:08:37,178 --> 00:08:38,813
Oh.

00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,282
I'm... I'm sorry to hear that.

00:08:40,348 --> 00:08:43,652
I never thought
I'd outlive my son.

00:08:45,687 --> 00:08:48,023
Is there anything else?

00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:50,525
Did you know a person
with the last name Cyden?

00:08:50,592 --> 00:08:52,193
C-Y-D-E-N?
Paul Cyden.

00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:55,196
He's a family friend;
he lives a couple blocks over.

00:08:55,263 --> 00:08:57,399
So Brian knew him, too?

00:08:57,465 --> 00:09:01,202
Oh, he was like a father to
Brian after my husband died.

00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:03,338
Why are you asking
about Paul?

00:09:03,405 --> 00:09:05,640
Ma'am, your son had
a good deal of cash

00:09:05,707 --> 00:09:07,342
stashed away in his bedroom.

00:09:07,409 --> 00:09:09,044
Was he saving up for something?

00:09:11,646 --> 00:09:12,981
I don't know.

00:09:14,716 --> 00:09:17,085
What's going on here?

00:09:17,152 --> 00:09:18,520
Mrs. Towne, we think

00:09:18,587 --> 00:09:21,256
Brian was saving up
for a sex change operation.

00:09:21,323 --> 00:09:22,991
Were you aware
of this?

00:09:23,058 --> 00:09:25,660
My son was not a freak.

00:09:25,727 --> 00:09:27,095
No, I didn't say that.

00:09:27,162 --> 00:09:29,164
Ma'am, we're not trying
to upset you in any way.

00:09:29,231 --> 00:09:31,233
I volunteered to let you
in my house!

00:09:31,299 --> 00:09:33,768
And now I want you to leave.
I want you to leave right now!

00:09:43,545 --> 00:09:46,481
In college, I wanted
to be an archeologist,

00:09:46,548 --> 00:09:48,917
until I did a summer
on a dig in Tunisia.

00:09:48,984 --> 00:09:51,519
Hot. But that got me
into Forensics.

00:09:51,586 --> 00:09:53,054
What made you
pick Vegas?

00:09:53,121 --> 00:09:55,423
Well, it, uh,
it kind of picked me.

00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:57,058
(camera shutter clicking)

00:10:00,896 --> 00:10:02,230
Hey, check this out.

00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,538
Turquoise and silver beads.

00:10:10,605 --> 00:10:12,741
I got the matching necklace at
the Indian market in Santa Fe.

00:10:12,807 --> 00:10:14,242
SIDLE:
Everybody stop!

00:10:14,309 --> 00:10:16,011
Stop what
you're doing!

00:10:17,445 --> 00:10:19,080
What is the problem now?
We have just

00:10:19,147 --> 00:10:20,548
found evidence
that this might be

00:10:20,615 --> 00:10:21,750
a Native American burial site.

00:10:21,816 --> 00:10:23,385
We have to notify the
Inter-Tribal Council.

00:10:23,451 --> 00:10:25,987
Until they say so,
nobody touches anything.

00:10:26,054 --> 00:10:27,055
Hey, Grissom.

00:10:27,122 --> 00:10:28,957
About your
hanging victim.

00:10:29,024 --> 00:10:30,592
The one with
the "chesticals."

00:10:30,659 --> 00:10:32,127
The man boobs...

00:10:32,193 --> 00:10:34,663
Uh, the...
gynecomastia, sorry.

00:10:34,729 --> 00:10:36,531
Quant hormone report.

00:10:36,598 --> 00:10:38,700
Androgen's low.
Estradiol's high.

00:10:38,767 --> 00:10:40,502
It's 250 picograms
per milliliter.

00:10:40,569 --> 00:10:42,604
Arogesterone, too.

00:10:42,671 --> 00:10:44,239
Estrogen level
is five times

00:10:44,306 --> 00:10:45,807
the normal amount
for an adult male.

00:10:45,874 --> 00:10:47,909
It's consistent with
a pre-op transsexual.

00:10:47,976 --> 00:10:51,713
Yeah, but there's no other
pre-op drugs in his system.

00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:56,351
No spironolactone,
no flutamide, progesterone.

00:10:56,418 --> 00:10:59,321
Maybe he's a
"do-it-yourselfer."

00:10:59,387 --> 00:11:00,589
Okay.

00:11:01,723 --> 00:11:03,325
(phone ringing)

00:11:07,028 --> 00:11:07,963
Hello?

00:11:08,029 --> 00:11:09,364
BRASS: Paul Cyden?
This is he.

00:11:13,101 --> 00:11:14,336
Paul Cyden.

00:11:14,402 --> 00:11:17,005
I'm Detective Jim Brass,
this is Catherine Willows,

00:11:17,072 --> 00:11:19,207
from the Crime Lab.
I'd like to ask you

00:11:19,274 --> 00:11:20,442
a couple questions
about Brian Towne.

00:11:20,508 --> 00:11:23,011
What a great kid.

00:11:23,078 --> 00:11:24,346
I can't believe he's gone.

00:11:24,412 --> 00:11:26,047
When was the last time
you talked with him?

00:11:26,114 --> 00:11:28,984
Oh, uh, honestly,
I don't remember.

00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:30,619
Oh, you don't remember
yesterday?

00:11:30,685 --> 00:11:31,953
Calling him? Texting him?

00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:35,357
Brian occasionally does odd jobs
for me.

00:11:35,423 --> 00:11:37,392
How odd?

00:11:37,459 --> 00:11:38,393
(nervous chuckle)

00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,661
I, uh, study water.

00:11:39,728 --> 00:11:40,996
I'm a hydrologist, retired,

00:11:41,062 --> 00:11:43,632
but I still
do consulting.

00:11:43,698 --> 00:11:46,134
Brian was helping me
with a project.

00:11:46,201 --> 00:11:47,969
Well, it seems to me,
according to your messages,

00:11:48,036 --> 00:11:49,671
Brian <i>was</i> the project.

00:11:49,738 --> 00:11:52,474
You're way off base.

00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,910
Then you won't mind giving us
your fingerprints and DNA?

00:11:54,976 --> 00:11:57,812
Not if you have a court order.
(cell phone ringing)

00:11:57,879 --> 00:12:00,282
Look, you can do this
the hard way or the easy way.

00:12:00,348 --> 00:12:02,150
But trust me,
we're going to get this done.

00:12:02,217 --> 00:12:04,252
Yeah, what's up, Doc?

00:12:04,319 --> 00:12:06,554
Yeah, Brian Towne's mother
is here.

00:12:06,621 --> 00:12:08,390
She wants to see the body.

00:12:08,456 --> 00:12:10,025
Okay. If anything of interest
pops up,

00:12:10,091 --> 00:12:11,526
why don't you text me?

00:12:11,593 --> 00:12:13,428
ROBBINS:
All right.

00:12:33,214 --> 00:12:35,417
He needed a haircut.

00:12:54,536 --> 00:12:55,937
(sniffles)

00:12:57,639 --> 00:12:59,608
(sobs)

00:13:02,944 --> 00:13:07,682
(various mechanisms
whirring, beeping)

00:13:11,286 --> 00:13:14,222
Are you lurking
around here for results?

00:13:14,289 --> 00:13:16,391
No. No, no.
I wouldn't do that.

00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:18,660
I was just, uh... I was
getting a cup of coffee.

00:13:18,727 --> 00:13:21,062
Actually.
You can come in.

00:13:21,129 --> 00:13:22,264
Why, do you got something?

00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:23,765
I do.
I got a two-fer.

00:13:23,832 --> 00:13:25,767
I got epithelials from the rope
from multiple contributors,

00:13:25,834 --> 00:13:27,269
and one of them...

00:13:27,335 --> 00:13:28,770
drank from the
bloody beer bottle.

00:13:28,837 --> 00:13:31,640
STOKES:
Larry Ludwig.

00:13:31,706 --> 00:13:35,176
Convicted of aggravated assault
and DUI.

00:13:35,243 --> 00:13:37,245
Bring up his
parole record.
Okay.

00:13:37,312 --> 00:13:38,446
(computer trilling)

00:13:38,513 --> 00:13:40,315
STOKES:
There you go.

00:13:40,382 --> 00:13:44,452
He works at the same water
treatment plant as my victim.

00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:46,087
Thought you were getting coffee.

00:13:46,154 --> 00:13:49,157
Right.

00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,228
You sure you fellas
don't want masks?

00:13:53,295 --> 00:13:55,697
The smell in here makes
some people puke.

00:13:55,764 --> 00:13:58,800
Mr. Ludwig, can we
see your palms, please?

00:13:58,867 --> 00:14:01,303
What, you gonna tell me
my future or something?

00:14:01,369 --> 00:14:03,004
Depends on what I see.

00:14:03,071 --> 00:14:04,773
I don't think so.

00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:07,542
Gentlemen?

00:14:07,609 --> 00:14:10,378
Hey, I was just getting
back to work, Mr. Quinn.
Jonah Quinn.

00:14:10,445 --> 00:14:11,880
General Manager.
I'm Warrick Brown.

00:14:11,947 --> 00:14:14,516
And I'm Nick Stokes, we're
with the Vegas Crime Lab.

00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,551
We're here investigating the
death of one of your employees,

00:14:16,618 --> 00:14:17,852
Brian Towne.

00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:19,721
I told them I had
nothing to say, sir.

00:14:19,788 --> 00:14:21,890
QUINN:
You have my permission
to question and search

00:14:21,957 --> 00:14:23,858
any of my employees.

00:14:23,925 --> 00:14:25,360
They don't have warrant,
Mr. Quinn.

00:14:25,427 --> 00:14:27,128
They're just... they're
just fishing around, sir.

00:14:27,195 --> 00:14:28,563
Anybody who doesn't
want to cooperate

00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,965
with the police in
trying to find out

00:14:30,031 --> 00:14:33,802
who killed Brian can clean out
their lockers and search

00:14:33,868 --> 00:14:36,671
for another job!

00:14:36,738 --> 00:14:40,141
Weren't they asking
you a question?

00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:41,576
Go ahead and
take off your gloves.

00:14:41,643 --> 00:14:44,045
Show us your palms.

00:14:49,384 --> 00:14:52,020
BROWN:
Well, now,

00:14:52,087 --> 00:14:53,555
they look like rope burns.

00:14:55,223 --> 00:14:57,058
Did you know that there's
a Paiute reservation

00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:58,560
in the heart of Las Vegas?

00:14:58,627 --> 00:15:01,229
It's only an acre, but it's
right up on North Main.

00:15:01,296 --> 00:15:03,465
Do you think that we
found the bones

00:15:03,531 --> 00:15:05,066
of one of their
ancestors?

00:15:05,133 --> 00:15:06,835
Well, the fusing
of the plates

00:15:06,902 --> 00:15:08,703
and shape of the skull
indicate a 30-year-old

00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:10,208
of the Mongoloid race.

00:15:10,275 --> 00:15:12,644
Which does include
Native Americans.

00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:14,880
And Southeast Asians,
Pacific Islanders.

00:15:14,946 --> 00:15:16,782
But take a look
at the teeth.

00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:23,221
I don't see any dental work.

00:15:23,288 --> 00:15:24,289
But there are caries.

00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:26,625
Cavities.
Right.

00:15:26,691 --> 00:15:28,360
Teeth from ancient tribal graves

00:15:28,426 --> 00:15:30,061
usually have
distinctive wear marks,

00:15:30,128 --> 00:15:33,298
uh, grooves from pipe-
smoking, rope-making--

00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:35,100
but no cavities.

00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:37,836
You look disappointed.

00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:40,272
I was... hoping, just once,

00:15:40,338 --> 00:15:43,775
Vegas would have
to honor its past.

00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:48,113
STOKES:
These tire treads were under
a tree where Brian's

00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,415
body was found.

00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:52,417
They're from a
Chevy Colorado.

00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:54,085
Isn't that what you drive?

00:15:54,152 --> 00:15:55,987
Yeah.

00:15:57,656 --> 00:15:59,524
You're putting a nice polish
on that wedding band.

00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:03,829
Hey, this is between us, right?

00:16:03,895 --> 00:16:06,498
Yeah, absolutely.
Oh, yeah.

00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:10,502
All right... I did see
Brian last night.

00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:12,571
Me and my buddy,
we started out at a bar,

00:16:12,637 --> 00:16:13,872
threw a few back, you know,

00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:15,874
met some ladies.

00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:18,009
And the hot one, she said,
"Let's go swimming."

00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:25,217
(indistinct talking, laughing)

00:16:25,283 --> 00:16:26,518
Brian. What's shaking?

00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:27,953
Not much.

00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:29,921
Anybody want one?

00:16:29,988 --> 00:16:31,022
Yes, please.

00:16:31,089 --> 00:16:33,825
So the girls, they wanted
to play Tarzan,

00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:36,394
so I pull my pickup truck
underneath the tree,

00:16:36,461 --> 00:16:38,463
I grabbed a rope
out of my utility box,

00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,999
and we all started stripping
down and everything...

00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:42,334
(laughing)

00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,337
Whoo!

00:16:45,403 --> 00:16:47,005
Come on,
it's fun!

00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:51,409
(whooping)

00:16:55,747 --> 00:16:57,015
Oh, my God.

00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:59,184
What?

00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:03,021
(laughing)

00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:04,723
I mean, the guy had boobs, man.

00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,925
I mean, you could see 'em
right through the T-shirt.

00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:12,197
I mean, we were all kind of
cracking up about it,

00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:14,399
but um... uh...

00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:16,168
it kind of broke the
party up a little bit.

00:17:16,234 --> 00:17:17,736
No, you kind of broke up
the party, man,

00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:19,271
when you cut him up
with a beer bottle

00:17:19,337 --> 00:17:21,006
and you hanged
him in a tree.

00:17:21,072 --> 00:17:24,176
Hey, man, I mean...
he ran off and we left.

00:17:24,242 --> 00:17:26,344
All right, I-I-I
don't know what else

00:17:26,411 --> 00:17:27,746
I can tell you.

00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:30,182
I mean, you can ask Tony--
he works with me, too.

00:17:30,248 --> 00:17:31,082
Where did you go?

00:17:31,149 --> 00:17:32,384
I went to the...

00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:34,886
I went to a motel with
one of, one of the girls.

00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:37,656
These girls have names?

00:17:37,722 --> 00:17:39,891
Yeah, mine
was, uh...

00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,393
She was named after
some city in Texas.

00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,394
I don't know, like, uh...

00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:44,429
Dallas or Houston or
something like that.

00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:46,765
The other one, she really
wasn't that hot,

00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:48,333
so I don't know
what her name was.

00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,734
You better hope
we find these girls.

00:17:49,801 --> 00:17:51,603
STOKES:
We better not find

00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,572
any of Brian's blood
in your flatbed.

00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:08,320
Wow!

00:18:08,386 --> 00:18:11,490
The original plans
for the Rampart.

00:18:11,556 --> 00:18:13,825
Opening day,
New Year's Eve, 1964.

00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:16,461
Half of the hotel tower
was still under construction,

00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:18,430
but Sam decided
to have the party anyway.

00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:19,898
He's got the Midas touch,

00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:22,901
and help from the
boys in Kansas City.

00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:25,737
This is the ultimate.

00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:28,173
Don't you have work to do?

00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,841
Deal me in.

00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:32,144
Well...

00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:34,780
the workers found
the bones here...

00:18:34,846 --> 00:18:38,784
which corresponds to this area.

00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:41,186
Bottom of the
construction shaft.

00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:43,922
Wonder if it's Gus
"the Beauty" Finkel.

00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:45,490
Snitch, disappeared in '64.

00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:47,659
The skull shape is Mongoloid.

00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:51,296
Maybe it's Eddie Chang,
the Peking Pimp.

00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:53,098
Caught Dean at the Sands,

00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:54,966
went out for eggs,
never came back.

00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:57,569
Did the Peking Pimp

00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,671
ever wear anything like this
on his arm?

00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:02,240
Nope. Just French cuffs
and platinum blondes.

00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:05,210
Careful with those.

00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:07,479
They're like the Dead Sea
Scrolls of Las Vegas.

00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:09,014
I have to go back to the scene.

00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,849
I'm off the clock.

00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,584
You, uh, need a hand?

00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:24,996
67.5 inches.

00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:26,798
(sighs):
Not the Peking Pimp.

00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:28,533
He was only five-two.

00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,403
It looks like every bone
in his body is broken.

00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,838
(camera shutter clicking)

00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:37,476
Check out the third
vertebrosternal rib,

00:19:37,542 --> 00:19:39,211
left side.

00:19:39,277 --> 00:19:40,979
Isn't that a bullet hole?
Exit wound.

00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:42,414
Good call.
Document it.

00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:44,182
Nothing says "Mob hit"

00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:46,051
like shot in the chest, thrown
down a construction shaft,

00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:48,887
and tucked in under
a concrete blanket.

00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:50,722
For real?

00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:52,324
My first Mob hit.

00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:54,493
Cool.
You know,

00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,228
only the bones at the point
of impact should be broken.

00:19:56,294 --> 00:19:58,430
Then the implosion
must have busted up

00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:00,232
the rest of him.

00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:05,070
Hey, Ronnie?

00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:06,505
Will you take a picture of this
for me, please?

00:20:06,571 --> 00:20:08,173
Yeah.

00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:11,376
(camera shutter clicking)

00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:14,613
It looks like...
treated hide.

00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,582
Buckskin.

00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:19,618
Maybe your M.E.
was wrong.

00:20:19,684 --> 00:20:21,386
Well, only if the ancient tribes
used sewing machines.

00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:22,587
The stitches are uniform.

00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:25,056
SANDERS:
You know, the showroom had this

00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:26,958
Wild West Revue
with cowboys,

00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:30,028
and horses, and rifles,
a real stagecoach.

00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:32,531
And Indians
who shot flaming arrows

00:20:32,597 --> 00:20:33,899
that ripped off
the dance hall girls' clothes.

00:20:33,965 --> 00:20:36,802
It ran from the day
the Rampart opened

00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:38,670
until 1976.

00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:41,072
An Indian playing
an Indian?

00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:48,413
When I was growing up, there
weren't any lakes in Vegas,

00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,116
just hotel swimming pools.

00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:53,718
(knocking on door)

00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:56,855
I think Mr. Cyden
might be dodging us.

00:20:58,723 --> 00:21:00,625
Call in a 419.

00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:03,829
(camera shutter clicking)

00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:08,467
So you think that's a message
or his dinner?

00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:10,302
Well, that's carp.

00:21:10,368 --> 00:21:11,670
Nobody really
eats those.

00:21:11,736 --> 00:21:13,071
Body's in full rigor.

00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:14,906
Been dead at least ten hours.

00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:16,408
Appears to be...

00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:18,944
one, two, three gunshot wounds
to the torso.

00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:21,146
Probably rules out suicide.

00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:22,314
(grunts)

00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,849
No exit wounds.

00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:27,018
STOKES:
I don't see a gun
or cartridge casings anywhere.

00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:30,122
He has some fairly dense
gunshot residue patterns.

00:21:30,188 --> 00:21:31,923
Shooter was only
a couple of feet away,

00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,191
practically face-to-face.

00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:35,360
No signs of forced entry,
no signs of struggle.

00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:37,662
I bet he knew his killer.

00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:39,197
Maybe the same person

00:21:39,264 --> 00:21:41,566
who killed the tranny
killed the boyfriend.

00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:49,174
Offer to buy his house

00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:51,710
dated... yesterday.

00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:53,512
Who tears up an offer

00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:56,615
in this tough market?

00:21:56,681 --> 00:21:59,217
"Purchaser: Jonah Quinn."

00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:00,719
That's Brian's boss.

00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:02,487
I met him.

00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:05,157
This notebook charts
hormone levels.

00:22:05,223 --> 00:22:08,193
No names, just numbers.

00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:11,229
There's over 40
test subjects here.

00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:14,466
If this guy was running some
kind of underground clinic here,

00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:16,401
then where are the drugs?

00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:19,037
These could be hormones.

00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:22,274
Warrick found vials like that
in Brian's bedroom.

00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,342
Check that freezer.

00:22:27,078 --> 00:22:28,980
<i>Carpe diem.</i>

00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:30,715
Lots of them.

00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:34,085
Numbered and dated.

00:22:34,152 --> 00:22:35,220
Shoot me a number.

00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:37,622
"R-41"

00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:43,395
"June 20, 2007."

00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:45,630
Why would he be giving
hormones to fish?

00:22:50,936 --> 00:22:52,771
SIDLE:
Hodges?

00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:54,206
Here's the problem...

00:22:54,272 --> 00:22:56,241
You know, that's just
what Mom says

00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:58,610
when all I ask is to come home
for Thanksgiving.

00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:01,113
My John Doe is from 1964.

00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:02,848
Well, to quote Sherlock Sanders,

00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:04,749
"This town was built
on dead bodies."

00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:06,651
The National Missing Persons
Database

00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:09,788
only lists four persons in '64,
none of which are a match.

00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:11,089
It might help if we knew

00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:12,324
where he was from.

00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:13,625
Do I look like
the Ghost Whisperer?

00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:14,793
Every geographic area

00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,083
has specific levels
of oxygen isotopes

00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:19,787
due to rainfall,
climate and vegetation.

00:23:19,854 --> 00:23:22,256
And you can identify
those isotopes in bones.

00:23:22,323 --> 00:23:25,259
You do know that those isotopes
will only tell you

00:23:25,326 --> 00:23:27,628
where he spent the last three
years or so of his life.

00:23:31,132 --> 00:23:32,633
I'll take it.

00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,101
It's more then we have now.

00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:37,538
If this works,

00:23:37,605 --> 00:23:39,607
I write the paper
for the <i>Forensics Journal,</i>

00:23:39,673 --> 00:23:41,308
sole credit.

00:23:41,375 --> 00:23:43,344
Deal.

00:23:46,881 --> 00:23:48,616
Me and my big mouth.

00:24:19,513 --> 00:24:22,183
♪ ♪

00:24:31,392 --> 00:24:33,994

00:25:01,922 --> 00:25:04,925
♪ ♪

00:25:11,532 --> 00:25:13,467
Sara told me
to document the detritus,

00:25:13,534 --> 00:25:15,469
but I see you beat me to it.

00:25:15,536 --> 00:25:18,239
Oh, sorry, yeah, I kind
of got carried away,

00:25:18,305 --> 00:25:19,740
but look at this-- it's
the vic's right hand.

00:25:21,308 --> 00:25:23,010
He was holding on to
something and when they poured

00:25:23,077 --> 00:25:24,712
the concrete
on top of him,

00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:27,248
it made kind of a fossil.

00:25:27,314 --> 00:25:29,650
Whatever it was, we must have
collected it, right?

00:25:29,717 --> 00:25:30,751
It's definitely not a gun.

00:25:30,818 --> 00:25:33,454
No, you didn't
find one of those.

00:25:37,324 --> 00:25:39,960
Cigarette lighter?

00:25:41,962 --> 00:25:43,531
No.

00:25:49,069 --> 00:25:51,272
Hey.

00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:56,911
It's film.

00:25:56,977 --> 00:25:59,980
Uh, 35 millimeters
used to come in

00:26:00,047 --> 00:26:01,749
a screw-top metal
can like this.

00:26:01,816 --> 00:26:04,285
Whatever's on it
must be important enough

00:26:04,351 --> 00:26:09,123
for Mr. Bones to hang on to
it while taking a header.

00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:10,891
Later.

00:26:10,958 --> 00:26:11,892
JOHNSON:
<i>Black and white</i>

00:26:11,959 --> 00:26:13,527
Tri-X stock.

00:26:13,594 --> 00:26:15,262
It's pretty grainy.

00:26:15,329 --> 00:26:17,665
Photographers like it
'cause you can shoot fast.

00:26:17,731 --> 00:26:21,802
It's like finding pictures
of Lincoln at Ford's Theatre.

00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:27,241
The party was
on the rooftop.

00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:32,113
Bring up that last shot
on the roll.

00:26:33,414 --> 00:26:35,349
Hmm.

00:26:35,416 --> 00:26:38,219
Let's see if we can take
a better look at that.
(typing)

00:26:39,253 --> 00:26:42,356
Looks like the casino take
on opening day.

00:26:42,423 --> 00:26:44,258
Everybody got a cut--

00:26:44,325 --> 00:26:48,963
the feds, the state--
and something called Fergus.

00:26:52,533 --> 00:26:55,269
GRISSOM:
I love it when
you dress up.

00:26:55,336 --> 00:26:56,804
(Sidle laughs)

00:26:56,871 --> 00:26:57,938
Well, you know,

00:26:58,005 --> 00:27:00,941
whatever it takes to
get some time with you.

00:27:01,008 --> 00:27:02,009
How's the study going?

00:27:02,076 --> 00:27:04,445
Any sign of Colony
Collapse Disorder?

00:27:04,512 --> 00:27:06,046
Nope, so far it's healthy.

00:27:06,113 --> 00:27:08,783
(clearing throat):
Nothing too healthy
about smoking.

00:27:08,849 --> 00:27:11,752
(coughs)
Well, the scent confuses
the guard bees.

00:27:11,819 --> 00:27:13,621
They won't emit
the pheromone

00:27:13,687 --> 00:27:16,557
that tells the colony
there's an intruder.

00:27:16,624 --> 00:27:18,959
Don't worry, he's harmless.

00:27:23,531 --> 00:27:24,899
Who's who?

00:27:24,965 --> 00:27:26,500
These are
the workers--

00:27:26,567 --> 00:27:28,068
infertile females.

00:27:28,135 --> 00:27:29,303
They don't sting?

00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:30,971
No, not unless you swat one,

00:27:31,038 --> 00:27:33,908
or close one up in your hand,
or freak out.

00:27:33,974 --> 00:27:35,643
Go ahead, take off your glove.

00:27:35,709 --> 00:27:38,345
Eh... all right, I trust you.

00:27:41,749 --> 00:27:43,484
See?

00:27:43,551 --> 00:27:45,119
It's cool.

00:27:45,186 --> 00:27:46,253
(weak laugh)

00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,156
The worker bees
defend the hive,

00:27:49,223 --> 00:27:51,258
procure the pollen,
make the honey,

00:27:51,325 --> 00:27:53,360
nurture the larvae and pupae

00:27:53,427 --> 00:27:55,029
in each of these
brood cells.

00:28:00,968 --> 00:28:02,970
You know,
maybe we should get married.

00:28:04,905 --> 00:28:07,208
SIDLE:
Ouch!

00:28:07,274 --> 00:28:08,375
Oh, oh...
Ow.

00:28:08,442 --> 00:28:09,610
I'm sorry.
Ow.

00:28:09,677 --> 00:28:10,811
(laughs)

00:28:10,878 --> 00:28:13,547
No, no, don't, don't,
don't pick it out.

00:28:13,614 --> 00:28:17,184
Makes it worse, releases the
venom into the bloodstream.

00:28:17,251 --> 00:28:19,053
It's better
to scrape it.

00:28:26,227 --> 00:28:30,464
So, uh... what do you think,
you know, about...

00:28:30,531 --> 00:28:33,367
Yes.

00:28:35,035 --> 00:28:36,871
Let's do it.

00:28:36,937 --> 00:28:38,472
Yeah?

00:28:38,539 --> 00:28:40,274
(laughs)

00:28:53,387 --> 00:28:55,322
Hi, Sara.

00:28:55,389 --> 00:28:57,324
You look
like you're having a good day.

00:28:57,391 --> 00:28:58,626
Thanks.

00:28:58,692 --> 00:28:59,693
Got your
isotope results.

00:29:02,563 --> 00:29:04,698
My John Doe lived

00:29:04,765 --> 00:29:05,699
in Southeast Asia?

00:29:05,766 --> 00:29:06,700
Yeah, uh, more specifically,

00:29:06,767 --> 00:29:08,269
southern Vietnam.

00:29:08,335 --> 00:29:09,737
Like I said,
this test only dates back

00:29:09,804 --> 00:29:10,738
to the last three years

00:29:10,805 --> 00:29:12,239
of his life.

00:29:12,306 --> 00:29:16,076
In '64... soldier?

00:29:16,143 --> 00:29:18,946
Consultant, refugee?

00:29:19,013 --> 00:29:20,414
Thanks. Hm.

00:29:20,481 --> 00:29:21,715
Let me know if you get an I.D.

00:29:21,782 --> 00:29:24,785
It'd be a great touch
for the article.

00:29:28,122 --> 00:29:29,723
Hey, what are you up to?

00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:31,392
Nothing.

00:29:31,459 --> 00:29:32,460
Why?

00:29:36,263 --> 00:29:38,599
What's in the cooler?

00:29:39,633 --> 00:29:41,969
Carp.

00:29:42,036 --> 00:29:43,437
Paul Cyden died

00:29:43,504 --> 00:29:45,039
holding one.

00:29:45,106 --> 00:29:46,307
He had a freezer
full of them,

00:29:46,373 --> 00:29:47,575
some kind of an experiment.

00:29:47,641 --> 00:29:50,077
Huh.

00:29:50,144 --> 00:29:53,047
I can process those
fish if you like.

00:29:53,114 --> 00:29:55,449
Do I know how
to turn you on or what?

00:30:02,189 --> 00:30:04,125
Hey.

00:30:04,191 --> 00:30:05,192
Heard you were
looking for me.

00:30:05,259 --> 00:30:06,560
Yeah, our friend Larry Ludwig--

00:30:06,627 --> 00:30:09,130
he's sharp as a marble,
but his alibi checked out.

00:30:09,196 --> 00:30:11,232
We found the motel
and the girl.

00:30:11,298 --> 00:30:13,667
Really?

00:30:13,734 --> 00:30:14,802
(sighing):
What's her name?

00:30:14,869 --> 00:30:15,936
Tucson.

00:30:16,003 --> 00:30:16,937
Ah, yes.

00:30:17,004 --> 00:30:19,640
Tucson, the capital of Texas.

00:30:19,707 --> 00:30:21,976
(both chuckling)

00:30:22,042 --> 00:30:26,113
Well, Paul Cyden's DNA and
fingerprints finally arrived.

00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,948
Well, I'll run it, but
I don't think it'll matter.

00:30:28,015 --> 00:30:29,483
I think Brian killed himself.

00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:33,187
You think he just climbed that
big ol' tree all by himself?

00:30:33,254 --> 00:30:34,655
Yeah.

00:30:34,722 --> 00:30:36,891
Okay, yeah.

00:30:36,957 --> 00:30:38,292
What about the mutilation?

00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:39,894
Self-inflicted.

00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,996
It took a while,
but Mandy was able to recover

00:30:42,062 --> 00:30:43,631
some prints
from the beer bottle,

00:30:43,697 --> 00:30:44,999
but it came back to Brian.

00:31:11,258 --> 00:31:13,627
So this was a hate crime.

00:31:13,694 --> 00:31:14,628
Yeah.

00:31:14,695 --> 00:31:17,164
He hated himself.

00:31:22,503 --> 00:31:25,906
(machine beeping)

00:31:29,443 --> 00:31:31,145
Yes?

00:31:31,212 --> 00:31:33,681
Oh, sorry,
just a bad habit

00:31:33,747 --> 00:31:36,383
from when we worked
the Miniature case together.

00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:37,418
That was fun, wasn't it?

00:31:37,485 --> 00:31:39,687
I thought so.

00:31:39,754 --> 00:31:41,922
What do you see?

00:31:43,924 --> 00:31:46,193
Well, those are
eggs-- it's a girl.

00:31:48,329 --> 00:31:51,098
And those white organs
would be gonads.

00:31:52,133 --> 00:31:54,401
Male and female parts.

00:31:54,468 --> 00:31:55,903
Simultaneous hermaphroditism?

00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:57,538
Stop me if you
already know this,

00:31:57,605 --> 00:31:59,373
but some fish do change sex
naturally.

00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,609
Not carp.

00:32:01,675 --> 00:32:02,777
I heard of a study

00:32:02,843 --> 00:32:06,080
when I was attending
a forensics consortium in D.C.

00:32:06,147 --> 00:32:08,015
Feminized male bass were found
in the wastewater effluent

00:32:08,082 --> 00:32:10,985
of the Potomac River.

00:32:13,821 --> 00:32:14,989
It's the water.

00:32:15,055 --> 00:32:16,457
Yeah, it was full
of excreted pharmaceuticals

00:32:16,524 --> 00:32:17,875
and what they called
"personal care products,"

00:32:17,941 --> 00:32:20,477
all of which supposedly altered
the endocrine system

00:32:20,544 --> 00:32:21,912
of the fish and their young.

00:32:21,979 --> 00:32:25,349
Good, Hodges.

00:32:25,416 --> 00:32:27,985
Well, now that we're
working together again...

00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,623
...take at least
two organ samples

00:32:32,689 --> 00:32:34,892
along with blood.

00:32:34,958 --> 00:32:36,126
Send them with
these water samples

00:32:36,193 --> 00:32:40,364
to our clinical lab
for hormone quants.

00:32:40,431 --> 00:32:42,499
You got it, partner.

00:32:46,703 --> 00:32:48,439
LILY:
Melvin Fergus.

00:32:48,505 --> 00:32:50,874
He was
a gaming commissioner.

00:32:50,941 --> 00:32:52,242
"Honest Melvin."

00:32:52,309 --> 00:32:54,244
Well, it looks
like Honest Melvin

00:32:54,311 --> 00:32:55,312
was on the take.

00:32:55,379 --> 00:32:56,747
Bribing a public
official could cost you

00:32:56,814 --> 00:32:57,948
your gaming license.

00:32:58,015 --> 00:33:00,284
Maybe our dead guy
found out about it

00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:03,387
and somebody found out about
him finding out about it.

00:33:03,454 --> 00:33:05,155
Who was this dead guy?

00:33:05,222 --> 00:33:07,858
Some wisenheimer with
extortion on the brain.

00:33:07,925 --> 00:33:09,059
Maybe a reporter.

00:33:09,126 --> 00:33:10,060
Hi, Lily.

00:33:10,127 --> 00:33:12,329
Hi.

00:33:12,396 --> 00:33:13,564
Uh, Wendy ran that tooth.

00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:15,299
Pre-CODIS, but DNA confirms

00:33:15,365 --> 00:33:17,401
that our John Doe
was Native American,

00:33:17,468 --> 00:33:20,003
so it was
one Indian's burial ground.

00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:23,273
There was a reporter
and I'm pretty sure

00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,708
he was an Indian.

00:33:25,909 --> 00:33:28,011
Lee George.

00:33:28,078 --> 00:33:30,080
He'd just come back
from Vietnam

00:33:30,147 --> 00:33:31,115
for <i>Life</i> magazine

00:33:31,181 --> 00:33:34,251
and he was doing
a piece on Vegas.

00:33:34,318 --> 00:33:36,120
Do you remember if
he was at the party?

00:33:36,186 --> 00:33:40,758
Yeah, in this little
Indian costume--

00:33:40,824 --> 00:33:43,193
bracelets on his biceps,

00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:45,028
and boy,
did he have biceps.

00:33:45,095 --> 00:33:47,030
Trust me.

00:33:47,097 --> 00:33:49,466
If anybody hurt him,
it was Benny Dunbar,

00:33:49,533 --> 00:33:50,834
Sam's bodyguard.

00:33:52,369 --> 00:33:56,106
That lump in his jacket
ain't a heart full of love.

00:33:56,173 --> 00:33:57,875
(lively swing music playing,
crowd cheering)

00:34:23,967 --> 00:34:26,503
I'll take that camera,
kemosabe.

00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,781
(yells)

00:34:43,087 --> 00:34:44,655
Either Benny tossed him

00:34:44,721 --> 00:34:46,023
or he jumped.

00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:48,459
We'll never know.

00:34:49,493 --> 00:34:51,662
This is great
stuff for my book.

00:34:51,728 --> 00:34:52,796
Your what?

00:34:52,863 --> 00:34:56,366
Oh, this little piece
on Vegas history--

00:34:56,433 --> 00:34:58,068
stories that didn't
make the papers.

00:34:58,135 --> 00:35:01,505
Honey, if you need
to know anything, just ask me.

00:35:01,572 --> 00:35:03,040
I was there.

00:35:03,107 --> 00:35:06,510
Well, how about if I take
you to dinner tonight?

00:35:06,577 --> 00:35:07,711
A bottle and a bird.

00:35:07,778 --> 00:35:09,580
We'll talk about
the Peking Pimp.

00:35:09,646 --> 00:35:11,615
LILY:
Eddie Chang.

00:35:11,682 --> 00:35:14,184
They shipped him
home in pieces.

00:35:15,619 --> 00:35:18,288
GRISSOM:
20 years ago, Verdant Glen
was far enough outside Vegas

00:35:18,355 --> 00:35:21,692
to get the right to use
well water for drinking.

00:35:21,759 --> 00:35:24,561
They also got approval to remove
waste water at a private plant.

00:35:24,628 --> 00:35:27,765
There, it was cleaned,
creating "grey water,"

00:35:27,831 --> 00:35:30,267
which was used for
secondary purposes--

00:35:30,334 --> 00:35:32,703
watering lawns,
washing cars,

00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:34,438
everything but drinking.

00:35:34,505 --> 00:35:36,607
The treatment plant then
stored excess grey water

00:35:36,673 --> 00:35:38,776
in the reservoir.

00:35:38,842 --> 00:35:41,545
Where they let the kids
fish and swim.

00:35:41,612 --> 00:35:43,647
GRISSOM: It passed
every water quality test.

00:35:43,714 --> 00:35:45,949
WILLOWS: And the carp
from Paul Cyden's freezer had

00:35:46,016 --> 00:35:49,119
high levels of estrogen
plus other prescription drugs.

00:35:49,186 --> 00:35:51,388
GRISSOM:
Brian's level and tox panel
correlate to the carp.

00:35:51,455 --> 00:35:53,757
Cyden was collecting
water samples

00:35:53,824 --> 00:35:56,093
from the reservoir,
the tap,

00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,294
and the treatment plant.

00:35:57,361 --> 00:35:59,229
Thanks to Brian.

00:35:59,296 --> 00:36:00,731
According to Cyden's
research, the hormone levels

00:36:00,798 --> 00:36:03,100
in the tap water are
nearly equal to the water

00:36:03,167 --> 00:36:04,201
in the reservoir.

00:36:04,268 --> 00:36:05,436
I thought they drink
ground water.

00:36:05,502 --> 00:36:06,603
They do.

00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:08,505
Cyden was convinced
that the ground water

00:36:08,572 --> 00:36:09,706
was contaminated.

00:36:09,773 --> 00:36:11,442
How?
He discovered
that the reservoir

00:36:11,508 --> 00:36:14,478
was improperly lined,
allowing the grey water

00:36:14,545 --> 00:36:17,014
to leech
into the ground water.

00:36:17,081 --> 00:36:18,582
STOKES;
Well, if that's the case,

00:36:18,649 --> 00:36:20,417
then why didn't the other boys
develop breasts?

00:36:20,484 --> 00:36:21,452
There's a
good chance

00:36:21,518 --> 00:36:22,753
that others have been affected,

00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:24,154
especially children
who were born

00:36:24,221 --> 00:36:26,223
to women who were living there
while they were pregnant.

00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:27,491
Because the womb
is the only place

00:36:27,558 --> 00:36:29,426
a human lives
in fluid...

00:36:29,493 --> 00:36:31,195
like a fish.

00:36:32,563 --> 00:36:34,231
That reservoir
is supposed to be lined

00:36:34,298 --> 00:36:36,166
to prevent contamination.

00:36:36,233 --> 00:36:37,468
Obviously,
it's not.

00:36:37,534 --> 00:36:39,136
Or the lining's defective.

00:36:39,203 --> 00:36:41,472
Which is the decision I
think Cyden had come to

00:36:41,538 --> 00:36:44,007
right before he was shot.

00:36:44,074 --> 00:36:46,210
You don't know
where he got those samples.

00:36:46,276 --> 00:36:48,679
Cyden could have pulled them
from raw sewage for all I know.

00:36:48,746 --> 00:36:50,114
And just
for the record,

00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,615
that reservoir
was built to code.

00:36:51,682 --> 00:36:53,884
You show me one complaint,
one documented illness

00:36:53,951 --> 00:36:55,419
from that water.

00:36:55,486 --> 00:36:57,187
What about Brian Towne?

00:36:57,254 --> 00:36:58,188
Listen...

00:36:58,255 --> 00:37:01,058
it's a tragedy...

00:37:01,125 --> 00:37:04,461
but his mother
has breast cancer.

00:37:04,528 --> 00:37:07,131
You don't think it's that gene
pool that might be polluted?

00:37:07,197 --> 00:37:08,799
BRASS: Let me ask
you something.

00:37:08,866 --> 00:37:10,768
Why did you offer to
pay such a big price

00:37:10,834 --> 00:37:11,502
for Paul Cyden's house?

00:37:11,568 --> 00:37:12,803
He's a nut.

00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:14,605
He was trying to sink me.

00:37:14,671 --> 00:37:16,006
His research was wrong,

00:37:16,073 --> 00:37:18,075
but perception
is reality these days.

00:37:18,142 --> 00:37:19,410
I admit it.

00:37:19,476 --> 00:37:20,911
I was trying to buy him off.

00:37:20,978 --> 00:37:22,479
Would have been money
well spent.

00:37:22,546 --> 00:37:24,448
But he turned you down.

00:37:25,983 --> 00:37:28,852
Is that why you shot him?

00:37:28,919 --> 00:37:31,422
I mean, with Brian gone,
you're in the clear.

00:37:31,488 --> 00:37:36,293
Look, I don't need a gun;
I've got lawyers.

00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,228
And I would like
to speak to them now.

00:37:40,798 --> 00:37:43,233
Here's the bullets
pulled from Paul Cyden.

00:37:44,917 --> 00:37:46,419
Thanks.

00:37:46,486 --> 00:37:47,487
Mm-hmm.

00:37:52,125 --> 00:37:54,460
Well, all three
are jacketed hollow points

00:37:54,527 --> 00:37:55,895
with a center post.

00:37:55,962 --> 00:37:57,463
Hydra-Shok.

00:37:57,530 --> 00:38:01,567
Only one company makes them--
Federal.

00:38:01,634 --> 00:38:02,635
You know what?

00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:06,272
Cath, I found a box
of this same ammo

00:38:06,339 --> 00:38:07,340
in Brian Towne's bedroom.

00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:10,610
Five bullets missing.

00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:24,457
Got five lands and grooves,
right-hand twist.

00:38:24,524 --> 00:38:29,996
Could've been fired from
a Smith and Wesson,
Ruger, or a Taurus.

00:38:31,397 --> 00:38:35,835
Brian bought a Ruger SP 101
revolver two weeks ago.

00:38:35,902 --> 00:38:36,836
Damn.

00:38:36,903 --> 00:38:38,404
The mother had
access to that gun

00:38:38,471 --> 00:38:40,907
and motive.

00:38:40,973 --> 00:38:43,576
LYNN TOWNE:
<i>I was too busy</i>

00:38:43,643 --> 00:38:46,879
taking care of me...

00:38:46,946 --> 00:38:48,714
to see what was wrong with him.

00:38:50,483 --> 00:38:52,852
The signs were there.

00:38:52,919 --> 00:38:55,354
Mrs. Towne,
don't blame yourself.

00:38:55,421 --> 00:38:58,391
You had a teenager who was
depressed and not communicating

00:38:58,458 --> 00:39:00,259
and you push too hard
and they pull away...

00:39:00,326 --> 00:39:02,328
I should have pushed.

00:39:02,395 --> 00:39:04,964
If I had gone through his
room before he died...

00:39:06,999 --> 00:39:09,168
maybe then...

00:39:09,235 --> 00:39:12,238
Is that when you found his gun?

00:39:14,333 --> 00:39:17,270
I was trying to understand why.

00:39:18,271 --> 00:39:20,106
I went through
his e-mails.

00:39:24,744 --> 00:39:27,280
Paul was taking him to L.A.

00:39:27,346 --> 00:39:30,750
I trusted him, and
all those years

00:39:30,817 --> 00:39:34,220
that he pretended
to be our friend...

00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:39,292
He killed my son.

00:39:40,326 --> 00:39:43,396
Mrs. Towne...

00:39:43,462 --> 00:39:45,231
he was trying to save your son,

00:39:45,298 --> 00:39:47,033
not hurt him.

00:39:47,099 --> 00:39:48,467
We found this letter
on Paul's computer.

00:39:48,534 --> 00:39:52,605
You need to read it.

00:39:52,672 --> 00:39:54,307
PAUL CYDEN:
<i>"I have decided to alert you</i>

00:39:54,373 --> 00:39:58,578
<i>"to this grave matter</i>
<i>prior to contacting the EPA.</i>

00:39:58,644 --> 00:40:00,079
<i>"It is</i>
<i>my professional conclusion</i>

00:40:00,146 --> 00:40:01,481
<i>"that the water</i>
<i>in this community</i>

00:40:01,547 --> 00:40:05,585
<i>"contains unsafe levels</i>
<i>of pharmaceutical contaminants,</i>

00:40:05,651 --> 00:40:07,286
<i>"which have caused</i>
<i>irreparable harm</i>

00:40:07,353 --> 00:40:08,721
<i>"to wildlife and humans.</i>

00:40:08,788 --> 00:40:11,224
<i>"One specific example</i>
<i>is the case of Brian Towne.</i>

00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:13,759
<i>"His endocrine system</i>
<i>and physical body</i>

00:40:13,826 --> 00:40:15,661
<i>"have been 'feminized'</i>
<i>due to chronic ingestion</i>

00:40:15,728 --> 00:40:19,532
<i>of the water at Verdant Glen."</i>

00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:22,101
He was going
to blow the whistle.

00:40:22,168 --> 00:40:26,272
I think that's what Paul
was trying to explain to you

00:40:26,339 --> 00:40:28,307
when you went over
to confront him.

00:40:33,379 --> 00:40:36,682
I worked two jobs
to keep us in our house

00:40:36,749 --> 00:40:41,454
because...
because Brian loved it so much.

00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,563
And being there
is what killed him.

00:40:56,702 --> 00:40:58,638
WOMAN:
<i>The feds</i>
<i>have already swooped in</i>

00:40:58,704 --> 00:41:00,673
to investigate
the water problem.

00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:03,109
Do they plan
to prosecute Jonah Quinn?

00:41:03,176 --> 00:41:05,511
They'll try, but Quinn
isn't the only one involved.

00:41:05,578 --> 00:41:08,347
Verdant Glen is now
owned by a conglomerate--

00:41:08,414 --> 00:41:10,349
the Altimera World Group.

00:41:10,416 --> 00:41:12,185
They'll bring in experts
to contradict the research,

00:41:12,251 --> 00:41:13,953
discredit witnesses.

00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,521
They'll say that
there are chemicals

00:41:15,588 --> 00:41:18,424
in everything that we
eat, touch, breathe.

00:41:18,491 --> 00:41:20,159
It'll be in
litigation for years.

00:41:20,226 --> 00:41:22,862
What about Brian's mother?

00:41:22,929 --> 00:41:24,030
Are you going
to prosecute her?

00:41:24,096 --> 00:41:26,165
Did you recover
the murder weapon,

00:41:26,232 --> 00:41:28,201
find her prints

00:41:28,267 --> 00:41:32,872
in blood at Cyden's house,
or get a signed confession?

00:41:32,939 --> 00:41:33,973
Her son's gun

00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:38,010
plus motive--
that's not enough?

00:41:38,077 --> 00:41:40,880
She's a widow
with breast cancer

00:41:40,947 --> 00:41:43,683
who lost her only kid.

00:41:44,917 --> 00:41:46,018
(sighs)

00:41:46,085 --> 00:41:48,888
No way I'd get her
in front of a jury

00:41:48,955 --> 00:41:50,356
and ask them to convict.

00:41:51,891 --> 00:41:53,926
Nice work though.

00:41:55,928 --> 00:41:58,731
Lynn Towne goes free.

00:41:58,798 --> 00:42:00,066
It's all
out of our hands now.

00:42:00,132 --> 00:42:03,069
That's not enough for me.

00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:06,906
If their lawyers can
hog-tie the EPA for years,

00:42:06,973 --> 00:42:08,941
someone's got to
go around them.

00:42:09,008 --> 00:42:11,377
They've got to take Brian's
story and the research

00:42:11,444 --> 00:42:13,513
to the press.

00:42:13,579 --> 00:42:15,348
I mean, if... if
it's happened here,

00:42:15,414 --> 00:42:17,550
what's to say there aren't
other Brians out there?

00:42:17,617 --> 00:42:21,954
You can't give information
about a case to the media.

00:42:22,021 --> 00:42:23,489
You'll get fired.

00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:29,862
As a mother, maybe I don't care.
