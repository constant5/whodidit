Yes, well,
don't get too excited

00:07:56,262 --> 00:08:00,466
because I got another hit off

00:08:00,533 --> 00:08:03,336
and I got one off
of the dresser-- rapist--

00:08:03,403 --> 00:08:05,438
and another one
off of the bed frame--

00:08:05,505 --> 00:08:08,441
a prostitute, a pimp,
and another prostitute.

00:08:08,508 --> 00:08:10,276

So the blood on the shirt
belongs to your victims.

00:08:14,347 --> 00:08:16,115
The high velocity spatter on
the front is a mixture of both

00:08:16,182 --> 00:08:18,384
and the blood drops
on the left sleeve appear

00:08:18,451 --> 00:08:20,053
to solely belong
to the woman.

00:08:20,119 --> 00:08:21,521
Probably cast-off
from the beating.

00:08:21,587 --> 00:08:24,223
Now, the pattern on the sleeve
has a straight line

00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:27,193
on the outside, and then
a matching band of spatter

00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,995
on the inside.

00:08:29,062 --> 00:08:30,797
So the killer rolled up
his sleeves?

00:08:30,863 --> 00:08:32,532
He had a lot of work to do.

00:08:32,598 --> 00:08:34,934
Speaking of which--

00:08:35,001 --> 00:08:36,169
The wet spot.

00:08:36,235 --> 00:08:39,405
The sex stain was a male-
female combo, both unknown,

00:08:39,472 --> 00:08:41,741
but the female
shared alleles

00:08:41,808 --> 00:08:44,811
at all loci
with both of the victims.

00:08:44,877 --> 00:08:47,780
It's their daughter.

00:08:48,815 --> 00:08:50,917
The parents weren't that old.

00:08:50,984 --> 00:08:54,053
The girl would be
a teenager at most.

00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,924
So the killer caps mom and dad,
rapes the girl,

00:08:57,991 --> 00:08:58,958
and takes
her with him.

00:08:59,025 --> 00:09:00,159

If you'll excuse me,
I have some chores to do.

00:10:03,589 --> 00:10:06,426
You ever been to
the Rancho Center Motel?

00:10:06,492 --> 00:10:08,328
Plenty of times.

00:10:08,394 --> 00:10:11,764
With hookers, addicts,
drug dealers, pimps,

00:10:11,831 --> 00:10:14,233
wife beaters, runaways.

00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,569
I save people.

00:10:16,636 --> 00:10:19,005
You ever save these two?

00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,308
You know them, don't you?

00:10:24,344 --> 00:10:26,679
There's nothing I can tell you.

00:10:26,746 --> 00:10:28,614
These people have a daughter,
and she's missing.

00:10:28,681 --> 00:10:30,950
And due to the fact that
you're a convicted sex offender

00:10:31,017 --> 00:10:32,952
that means that
you better come up with

00:10:33,019 --> 00:10:34,921
a lot more than these
corny priestly homilies

00:10:34,988 --> 00:10:36,155
and you better
come up with them fast.

00:10:36,222 --> 00:10:37,957
I don't answer to you.

00:10:38,024 --> 00:10:39,292
I want to talk
to my lawyer.

00:10:39,359 --> 00:10:42,428
That's a good idea
because you're under arrest.

00:10:42,495 --> 00:10:44,597
Yo, Rambar, I have
some documents to...
Sh...

00:10:44,664 --> 00:10:46,399
Piece of junk.
(slams lid)

00:10:46,466 --> 00:10:47,834
Where's Rambar?

00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,436
Where all state employees go
when they fail repeatedly.

00:10:50,503 --> 00:10:52,472
FBI Lab?
Sucking down
taxpayer dollars

00:10:52,538 --> 00:10:55,008
in Quantico as we speak.

00:10:55,074 --> 00:10:57,176
Me, I like to think I'm
broadening my horizons.

00:10:57,243 --> 00:10:58,511
Yeah, along with
your pay grade.

00:10:58,578 --> 00:11:00,713
Oh, happy coincidence
indeed, sir.

00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,515
What you got here?

00:11:02,582 --> 00:11:03,950
Wow.

00:11:04,017 --> 00:11:06,185
Somebody needs to switch
to decaf.

00:11:06,252 --> 00:11:08,321
In there somewhere is a Nevada
plate number and a name.

00:11:08,388 --> 00:11:09,489
Can you dig it out?

00:11:09,555 --> 00:11:11,391
I could try.

00:11:11,457 --> 00:11:14,394
BROWN:
The plate number is "something,
something, something, D,

00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,229
seven, something, something."

00:11:16,296 --> 00:11:17,597
Okay, well,
it's a fairly new model.

00:11:17,664 --> 00:11:19,132
The four letter,
three number configuration

00:11:19,198 --> 00:11:21,634
has only been standard
a couple years.

00:11:25,004 --> 00:11:26,739
Ooh.

00:11:26,806 --> 00:11:28,408
Well, uh... it's a start.

00:11:28,474 --> 00:11:30,510
Well, can you cross-reference
these records

00:11:30,576 --> 00:11:32,512
against the characters
in the vics' last name.

00:11:32,578 --> 00:11:34,681
It's "M, A, blank, blank, blank,

00:11:34,747 --> 00:11:38,251
I, blank, blank."

00:11:38,318 --> 00:11:39,719
(computer trills)

00:11:42,121 --> 00:11:44,223
Now that's a good start.

00:11:52,498 --> 00:11:55,201
BROWN:
Alvin and Girlie Macalino.

00:11:55,268 --> 00:11:57,036
Let's do it.

00:11:57,103 --> 00:11:59,639
This makes what, the third power
outage since summer?

00:11:59,706 --> 00:12:01,741
Fourth, actually.
If I didn't know any better,

00:12:01,808 --> 00:12:03,710
I'd say the city was
trying to get rid of us.

00:12:03,776 --> 00:12:06,179
That's a hundred dollar fine
right there.

00:12:11,718 --> 00:12:14,087
That's not good.

00:12:14,153 --> 00:12:16,155
BROWN:
Las Vegas PD.

00:12:16,222 --> 00:12:18,358
Is anybody home?

00:12:32,338 --> 00:12:35,942
It smells metallic.

00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:12,101
Oh, man.

00:13:12,168 --> 00:13:13,970
What the hell is that?

00:13:15,772 --> 00:13:18,374
That looks like balut.

00:13:18,441 --> 00:13:20,576
It's this Filipino
delicacy.

00:13:20,643 --> 00:13:23,379
My grandmother's best friend
is from Manila.

00:13:23,446 --> 00:13:25,615
Bet it tastes like chicken.

00:13:25,682 --> 00:13:27,583
The Macalinos must've been
in quite a hurry

00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:30,453
to leave their dinner out
like that.

00:13:52,075 --> 00:13:54,077
Oh...

00:13:56,646 --> 00:13:58,147
So much for the daughter.

00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:13,860
No visible signs
of sexual trauma.

00:14:13,927 --> 00:14:15,896
If it's any consolation.

00:14:15,963 --> 00:14:17,764
It's not.

00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:23,603
GRISSOM:
Burger Giant to go.

00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:26,440
They were eating it at the motel
and someone had it here.

00:14:26,506 --> 00:14:28,775
Possible connection?

00:14:28,842 --> 00:14:32,946
Hey, maybe we can add robbery
to the list.

00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:40,621
Wi-Fi card but no laptop.

00:14:44,424 --> 00:14:46,693
Mom, dad...

00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,596
and <i>two</i> girls.

00:14:49,663 --> 00:14:51,431
They have another daughter?

00:14:51,498 --> 00:14:54,501
(muffled buzzing)

00:14:57,371 --> 00:15:00,907
Okay, so it's not just
the ringing in my ears.

00:15:00,974 --> 00:15:03,644
(muffled buzzing continues)

00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,432
(ladder clicking)

00:15:32,005 --> 00:15:35,008
(muffled buzzing continues)

00:15:55,228 --> 00:15:57,531
SANDERS:
One girl gets My Little Pony,

00:15:57,597 --> 00:15:59,299
the other one ends up here.

00:15:59,366 --> 00:16:02,069
That doesn't seem
fair, does it?

00:16:03,103 --> 00:16:04,871
(muffled buzzing continues)

00:16:04,938 --> 00:16:07,174
(insect buzzing)

00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:13,513
(buzzing continues)

00:16:18,619 --> 00:16:19,920
(bee buzzing)

00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:27,461
(buzzing grows louder)

00:16:27,527 --> 00:16:29,296
Greg?

00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:31,064
Do you have any allergies?

00:16:31,131 --> 00:16:32,399
No. Why?

00:16:32,466 --> 00:16:34,067
Give me a hand.

00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:47,347
(buzzing grows louder)

00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:01,228
(bees buzzing loudly)

00:17:03,664 --> 00:17:06,133
BRASS:
The Macalinos
had two daughters--

00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:07,250
Amy and Elizabeth.

00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:09,252
Elizabeth is dead,
and Amy is missing.

00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,221
That is tragic,

00:17:11,288 --> 00:17:13,056
but it has nothing to do
with my client.

00:17:13,123 --> 00:17:15,058
Your fingerprints
were found at the motel

00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:16,493
where the Macalinos
were murdered.

00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,428
My client has already
explained that.

00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:20,631
Back before
you were saving souls,

00:17:20,697 --> 00:17:23,200
when you were
just molesting children,

00:17:23,267 --> 00:17:24,735
you had a partner...

00:17:24,801 --> 00:17:26,503
ATTORNEY:
Who died in prison
eight years ago.

00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:28,672
We found male DNA
on the bedsheets

00:17:28,739 --> 00:17:30,674
at the Rancho Center Motel.

00:17:30,741 --> 00:17:33,577
You got yourself a new partner,
just like old times.

00:17:39,116 --> 00:17:42,319
Only, this time,
the parents busted in on you.

00:17:42,386 --> 00:17:45,255
That was bad for you,
but worse for them.

00:17:45,322 --> 00:17:47,524
And now that mom and dad
are never going to come home,

00:17:47,591 --> 00:17:50,961
you get yourself a whole new
playpen to party in

00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:52,796
and a new buddy to party with.

00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:55,132
The DNA at the motel--
was it my client's?

00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:58,035
No.

00:17:58,101 --> 00:17:59,937
Then why is he still in custody?

00:18:00,971 --> 00:18:03,473
Because he's still lying.

00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,243
You're not
an ordained minister.

00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:07,611
You're not a part
of any recognized church.

00:18:07,678 --> 00:18:09,880
You got nothing to hide behind.

00:18:09,947 --> 00:18:12,482
So avoid the death penalty--
give us your partner,

00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:14,051
we get the girl,

00:18:14,117 --> 00:18:17,654
and you get... redemption.

00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:19,556
Six years ago,

00:18:19,623 --> 00:18:22,092
I was an alcoholic
and a crackhead.

00:18:22,159 --> 00:18:24,394
This man pulled me
out of the gutter

00:18:24,461 --> 00:18:25,562
and saved my life.

00:18:25,629 --> 00:18:26,897
My firm is doing
this pro bono.

00:18:26,964 --> 00:18:29,166
I guarantee
he will not do

00:18:29,232 --> 00:18:30,901
another day in jail.

00:18:30,968 --> 00:18:34,671
My partner...

00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:36,239
is the Lord.

00:18:36,306 --> 00:18:39,876
Well, I'm sure it's not <i>His</i> DNA
on those sheets.

00:18:41,378 --> 00:18:43,380
LAKE:
So anyway, when I graduated

00:18:43,447 --> 00:18:47,150
I got offers from both the labs
in New York and Miami.

00:18:47,217 --> 00:18:49,353
Know why I picked Vegas?

00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:51,121
SIDLE:
I know you have
nine questions left.

00:18:51,188 --> 00:18:53,523
Crime rate's
growing faster here.

00:19:04,701 --> 00:19:08,005
All of his... um... valuables

00:19:08,071 --> 00:19:10,107
in a rubber-band wad.

00:19:10,173 --> 00:19:11,475
No I.D.

00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:12,509
Check the shirt pocket.

00:19:12,576 --> 00:19:14,378
I was getting there.

00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:18,482
Hah.

It's got to be handouts

00:19:32,529 --> 00:19:34,498
Make some calls.

00:19:34,564 --> 00:19:36,333
You get to ask some questions,
Ronnie.

00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:55,419
You know, if I had to
gauge it by his apartment,

00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:58,388
I'd say that Alistair Rhodes
is a regular guy.

00:19:58,455 --> 00:20:02,426
Yeah, I'm sure that's what he
wants everybody to think, too.

00:20:11,101 --> 00:20:14,171
Hey, Nick.

00:20:14,237 --> 00:20:17,007
For a guy with his own
flip-down ironing board,

He was

Listen to me.

00:22:14,467 --> 00:22:15,602
The mother came to me...

00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:18,305
at her wit's end,

heart in her hand, begging me,

begging me to free her child.

I saw it with my own eyes.

00:22:57,644 --> 00:22:58,778
it wasn't Amy.

00:22:58,845 --> 00:23:01,381
It wasn't human.

00:23:01,448 --> 00:23:03,383
I had to cast it out.

00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:04,584
Did it work?

00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:18,398
The exorcism-- did it work?

00:23:21,583 --> 00:23:22,750
No.

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,959
Amy's father broke
the rules:

00:23:26,583 --> 00:23:30,387
never speak to it,
never interrupt,

00:23:30,454 --> 00:23:33,023
and believe me completely.

00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:34,725
Do only as I say.

00:23:34,792 --> 00:23:36,260
And he didn't believe.

00:23:38,295 --> 00:23:41,699
Mr. Grissom, do you believe

00:23:41,765 --> 00:23:45,069
in a separate, living evil?

00:23:47,104 --> 00:23:51,141
You're primitive
man on the savannah.

00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:54,445
You see something move out
of the corner of your eye.

00:23:54,511 --> 00:23:56,814
You assume it's a hyena.

00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,750
You run, you live.

00:23:59,817 --> 00:24:04,455
If you assume it's the wind
and you're wrong, you die.

00:24:05,489 --> 00:24:08,058
We have the genes
of the ones who ran.

00:24:08,125 --> 00:24:11,128
We're genetically
hardwired

00:24:11,195 --> 00:24:14,264
to believe living forces
that we cannot see.

00:24:14,331 --> 00:24:17,234
The Devil's slyest trick

00:24:17,301 --> 00:24:19,970
is making us believe
he isn't real.

00:24:21,005 --> 00:24:24,308
But call his name
loud and long enough...

00:24:25,409 --> 00:24:28,946
...guess who comes
knocking on your door?

00:24:29,013 --> 00:24:30,014
Usually guys like you.

00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,249
Look, enough with the
Sunday school bull.

00:24:32,316 --> 00:24:34,551
This meeting is over,
the deal is off.

00:24:34,618 --> 00:24:36,420
We've answered your questions.
I told you

00:24:36,487 --> 00:24:39,089
the truth.

00:24:39,156 --> 00:24:41,091
You have to let me leave.

00:24:41,158 --> 00:24:42,559
He's right about that.
If you're

00:24:42,626 --> 00:24:43,594
not charging him
with anything...

00:24:43,661 --> 00:24:45,596
We're charging
you with assault.

00:24:45,663 --> 00:24:48,065
Fine. We'll make bail. You'll
be out of here in six hours.

00:24:51,335 --> 00:24:53,771
Multiple contusions
on the face,

00:24:53,837 --> 00:24:55,673
subdural hematomas.

00:24:55,739 --> 00:24:57,274
This guy
was definitely roughed up.

00:24:57,341 --> 00:24:58,909
C.O.D.?

00:24:58,976 --> 00:25:00,711
Being homeless
in Las Vegas.

00:25:00,778 --> 00:25:02,579
Cardiac arrest
due to dehydration.

00:25:02,646 --> 00:25:04,748
Thanks, Doc.
Anytime.

00:25:04,815 --> 00:25:06,083
Hi, Ronnie.
Hi.

00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:07,818
I faxed
the D.B.'s photo

00:25:07,885 --> 00:25:09,920
to various indigent
organizations.

00:25:09,987 --> 00:25:11,388
Shelter on Rancho and Main

00:25:11,455 --> 00:25:12,790
I.D.'d him as a regular.

00:25:12,856 --> 00:25:14,958
Their special this week
was socks and sandwiches.

00:25:15,025 --> 00:25:17,928
Rancho and Main is less than
a mile from where we found him.

00:25:17,995 --> 00:25:21,332
Bum got into a fight--
business as usual--

00:25:21,398 --> 00:25:23,467
and died of exposure, right?

00:25:23,534 --> 00:25:24,935
(chuckles)

00:25:25,002 --> 00:25:26,270
Oops, that was a question.

00:25:26,337 --> 00:25:28,272
I know,
I'm down to four,

00:25:28,339 --> 00:25:30,574
but, I mean, that's it--
case closed, right?

00:25:30,641 --> 00:25:33,344
What does that look like to you?

00:25:35,713 --> 00:25:39,650
Perimortem abrasions...
parallel, double rails.

00:25:39,717 --> 00:25:43,387
It's handcuffs.

00:25:43,454 --> 00:25:45,389
Cops must have picked him up
before he died.

00:25:45,456 --> 00:25:47,024
Maybe that's not all they did.

00:25:47,091 --> 00:25:48,826
Well, that's a guess.

00:25:48,892 --> 00:25:51,762
What is the first thing
that the police do

00:25:51,829 --> 00:25:53,197
when they question a suspect?

00:25:53,263 --> 00:25:54,665
Check for I.D.
Standard procedure.

00:25:54,732 --> 00:25:58,369
Eddie Kaye's only identification
was an expired driver's license

00:25:58,435 --> 00:26:00,070
found separated from all
of his worldly possessions.

00:26:01,939 --> 00:26:03,874
(sighing):
Print it.

00:26:03,941 --> 00:26:06,744
Well, you're not seriously
going to go after the cops

00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:07,778
over something like this?

00:26:07,845 --> 00:26:08,779
You know what?

00:26:08,846 --> 00:26:10,180
That question I will answer.

00:26:10,247 --> 00:26:12,516
We're not here to
protect anyone, Ronnie,

00:26:12,583 --> 00:26:13,817
not even the cops.

00:26:13,884 --> 00:26:16,120
We're here to figure
out what happened.

00:26:16,186 --> 00:26:20,891
If you can't do that, you
should get a different job.

00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:35,105
SIDLE:
Officer Casella?

00:26:35,172 --> 00:26:36,240
That's me.

00:26:36,306 --> 00:26:37,474
I'm Sara Sidle,
I'm with the crime lab.

00:26:37,541 --> 00:26:38,909
This is my partner
Ronnie Lake.

00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:39,910
Hi.

00:26:39,977 --> 00:26:41,145
Can you tell me
why your fingerprints

00:26:41,211 --> 00:26:42,446
were found
on this?

00:26:43,647 --> 00:26:45,482
Well, sure,
I touched it.

00:26:45,549 --> 00:26:46,917
What else did you touch?

00:26:48,285 --> 00:26:49,353
Uh...

00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,821
(laughing):
I'm sorry, what do you mean?

00:26:50,888 --> 00:26:52,156
Did you strike this man?

00:26:52,222 --> 00:26:53,857
Okay, are you
trying to jam me up?
We're not trying

00:26:53,924 --> 00:26:55,726
to do anything.
Where'd you get
the bruise,

00:26:55,793 --> 00:26:56,894
Casella?

00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,762
I got it doing my job.

00:26:58,829 --> 00:27:01,332
<i>A couple of train wrecks</i>
<i>were slugging it out</i>

00:27:01,398 --> 00:27:03,233
<i>over this crap sandwich.</i>

00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,335
<i>I try to save them</i>
<i>from themselves,</i>

00:27:04,401 --> 00:27:07,438
<i>but no good deed goes</i>
<i>unpunished,</i>

00:27:07,504 --> 00:27:10,741
<i>so, uh,</i>
<i>one of 'em takes a poke at me.</i>

00:27:14,345 --> 00:27:15,879
<i>So I cuff him up,</i>
<i>I check his I.D.</i>

00:27:15,946 --> 00:27:17,581
<i>I'm ready to run him in,</i>

00:27:17,648 --> 00:27:19,383
but my partner
says to drop it.

00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:20,384
Mm-hmm.
He says

00:27:20,451 --> 00:27:22,019
this is an
old bum trick,

00:27:22,086 --> 00:27:23,754
right, like take
a swing at a cop,

00:27:23,821 --> 00:27:26,223
you go to jail
where they have A.C.,

00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:27,358
they have food,
they have water.

00:27:27,424 --> 00:27:28,359
I can't believe

00:27:28,425 --> 00:27:29,593
I almost fell for that.

00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:30,694
I kind of wish you had.

00:27:30,761 --> 00:27:33,297
The man died.

00:27:58,722 --> 00:28:00,491
Wow.

00:28:00,557 --> 00:28:01,725
What do you got
there, Greg?

00:28:01,792 --> 00:28:04,061
.22 handgun.

00:28:04,128 --> 00:28:07,031
Looks like it could be
the murder weapon.

00:28:07,097 --> 00:28:08,165
You off the clock?
Yeah.

00:28:08,232 --> 00:28:09,833
Good job.

00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,468
Thanks.

00:28:11,535 --> 00:28:12,469
How you doing?

00:28:12,536 --> 00:28:15,072
Well, I've had better days.

00:28:15,139 --> 00:28:16,407
You missing me yet?

00:28:16,473 --> 00:28:17,841
A little more every day.

00:28:17,908 --> 00:28:19,510
Grissom's
in the attic.

00:28:19,576 --> 00:28:20,644
Still.

00:28:22,713 --> 00:28:24,615
(buzzing)

00:28:24,682 --> 00:28:25,616
Hey.
Hey.

00:28:25,683 --> 00:28:26,784
Bee frame.

00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:28,052
Inside, I've got the queen,

00:28:28,118 --> 00:28:29,086
the workers, the whole colony.

00:28:29,153 --> 00:28:30,187
You're looting
the crime scene

00:28:30,254 --> 00:28:31,622
of its bees?
I cleared it

00:28:31,689 --> 00:28:33,090
with Animal Control.

00:28:33,157 --> 00:28:34,291
This colony is healthy.

00:28:34,358 --> 00:28:37,161
I need it to study
Colony Collapse Disorder.

00:28:37,227 --> 00:28:39,496
Bees are dying in record
numbers everywhere.

00:28:39,563 --> 00:28:42,966
You know, I did read that
if every bee on Earth died,

00:28:43,033 --> 00:28:45,135
the human race would follow
four years later.

00:28:45,202 --> 00:28:48,806
There's no hard evidence
to support that, though.

00:28:48,872 --> 00:28:49,840
Oh.

00:28:49,907 --> 00:28:53,310
But the world will end...
someday.

00:29:04,922 --> 00:29:07,524
(indistinct radio transmission)

00:29:09,526 --> 00:29:11,695
You don't think
that's cheating?

00:29:11,762 --> 00:29:13,764
Anybody can get their
hands on that stuff.

00:29:13,831 --> 00:29:16,233
My kid can get "the
Clear," the cream.

00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,569
Dispatch, we have
plate number David-Paul

00:29:18,635 --> 00:29:20,537
William-Robert-
one-eight-four,

00:29:20,604 --> 00:29:22,306
multiple warrants,
parking violations.

00:29:22,373 --> 00:29:25,376
Maybe we should juice up
all the players.

00:29:25,442 --> 00:29:27,711
Level the field,
be more entertaining for me.

00:29:27,778 --> 00:29:30,314
You are one sick twist,
my friend, you know that?

00:29:30,381 --> 00:29:31,315
(monitor beeps)

00:29:31,382 --> 00:29:32,549
MALE ELECTRONIC VOICE:
Stolen vehicle.

00:29:32,616 --> 00:29:33,951
Hold up.

00:29:34,018 --> 00:29:35,152
Dispatch, we have plate number

00:29:35,219 --> 00:29:37,855
Paul-Robert-Zebra-David-
seven-five-zero.

00:29:37,921 --> 00:29:40,224
Stolen vehicle,
outstanding homicide.

00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:41,225
At Koval,

00:29:41,291 --> 00:29:42,326
off Las Vegas Boulevard.

00:29:42,393 --> 00:29:43,494
DISPATCHER:
Wanted for murder.

00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,262
Back up.

00:30:00,678 --> 00:30:01,779
Go, go, go, go!

00:30:01,845 --> 00:30:04,782
(tires screeching)

00:30:18,028 --> 00:30:19,897
Hands, let me see your hands!

00:30:19,963 --> 00:30:21,899
Out of the car now!

00:30:21,965 --> 00:30:23,067
Get your hands up!

00:30:23,133 --> 00:30:24,301
Let me see
your hands!

00:30:24,368 --> 00:30:26,103
Get out of
the car.

00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:27,338
Hands!

00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:30,741
You know who we're looking
for, scumbag-- Amy Macalino.

00:30:30,808 --> 00:30:32,276
Where is she?

00:30:32,343 --> 00:30:34,511
I'm Amy.

00:30:51,291 --> 00:30:52,834
So you're sure you never
saw this guy before?

00:30:52,901 --> 00:30:53,835
That guy?

00:30:53,902 --> 00:30:55,971
Uh-uh, no.

00:30:56,037 --> 00:30:59,040
Okay, but this guy,
uh-huh.

00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:02,210
Uh-huh, he was definitely
at the Rancho Center Motel.

00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:04,646
He was there, um,
three nights ago.

00:31:04,713 --> 00:31:07,416
Had his little camera
with him and everything.

00:31:07,482 --> 00:31:09,918
Camera?
Yeah, like video camera
and all that stuff.

00:31:09,985 --> 00:31:11,453
That helps, thanks.

00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,854
Thanks for your cooperation.

00:31:12,921 --> 00:31:15,690
Um...
don't I get a reward?

00:31:15,757 --> 00:31:18,760
Yeah, you
get to leave.

00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:27,669
Hi, Amy.

00:31:27,736 --> 00:31:29,905
I'm Catherine Willows,
I'm with the crime lab.

00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:31,907
You here to probe me?

00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:34,276
Swab.

00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:41,083
No, no, Amy, this, this is,
um, this is in the mouth.

00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:50,726
Staff tells me

00:31:50,792 --> 00:31:53,962
that you've already gone
through the S.A.E. kit.

00:31:54,029 --> 00:31:56,732
They tell you
I'm all banged up inside?

00:31:57,766 --> 00:32:00,736
Not in those words.

00:32:04,473 --> 00:32:08,110
Amy... the man that took you...

00:32:09,144 --> 00:32:11,413
...he cannot
hurt you again.

00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,048
We've got him.

00:32:13,115 --> 00:32:14,049
Then can I go?

00:32:14,116 --> 00:32:15,717
W-W-Where's my clothes?

00:32:15,784 --> 00:32:19,621
Well, they're evidence for now,
but you'll get them back.

00:32:23,325 --> 00:32:28,163
The clothes that you wore--
were they yours or...

00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:29,664
did he make you wear them?

00:32:33,168 --> 00:32:36,972
He made me do a lot of things.

00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:38,840
BRASS:
Andrew Wolflynn.

00:32:38,907 --> 00:32:40,509
Bet your friends
call you Wolf, huh?

00:32:40,575 --> 00:32:41,510
So I'm going

00:32:41,576 --> 00:32:43,044
to call you Wolf.

00:32:43,111 --> 00:32:45,080
You can call me Jim.

00:32:45,147 --> 00:32:47,382
You know, it's really exciting
to meet such a hyphenate.

00:32:47,449 --> 00:32:48,550
You know what I mean?

00:32:48,617 --> 00:32:49,985
I mean, you're a triple threat.

00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:54,656
You know, kidnapper-
rapist-auteur.

00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:57,225
Do you like
making movies?

00:32:57,292 --> 00:32:58,326
What are you talking about?

00:32:58,393 --> 00:32:59,828
Kiddie porn.

00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:01,596
No.

00:33:01,663 --> 00:33:03,498
No, n-no, no way,
no-not me, man.

00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:05,901
No, not just you--
you and a partner.

00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:09,805
<i>He shoots, you score.</i>

00:33:09,871 --> 00:33:11,373
(crying)

00:33:12,674 --> 00:33:13,775
It must be a really
good business.

00:33:13,842 --> 00:33:16,111
Low budget,
high profits.

00:33:16,178 --> 00:33:19,047
Unless you get caught.

00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:27,622
I've contacted Child Services.

00:33:27,689 --> 00:33:31,059
You'll have to stay there
for at least tonight.

00:33:33,095 --> 00:33:35,263
Do you have any relatives?

00:33:36,298 --> 00:33:38,400
Not anymore.

00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:44,306
I've got a daughter.

00:33:44,372 --> 00:33:48,477
She's almost your age.

00:33:48,543 --> 00:33:50,746
Maybe we should hang out.

00:33:52,748 --> 00:33:55,484
There'll be
some counselors there

00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:57,552
that you can talk to and...

00:33:58,587 --> 00:34:00,989
...take as much time
as you need and...

00:34:01,056 --> 00:34:04,693
whenever you're ready,
to go back to school.

00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,695
Where do you go?

00:34:06,762 --> 00:34:08,096
Jefferson.

00:34:08,163 --> 00:34:10,065
Jefferson High?

00:34:10,132 --> 00:34:11,099
I don't know that one.

00:34:11,166 --> 00:34:12,734
Jefferson Middle.

00:34:13,769 --> 00:34:17,105
Amy, what grade are you in?

00:34:17,172 --> 00:34:19,541
Sixth.

00:34:19,608 --> 00:34:21,042
I'm 12.

00:34:25,347 --> 00:34:28,049
We got your
fingerprints, your semen.

00:34:28,116 --> 00:34:30,051
I mean, we got you in
the dead couple's car

00:34:30,118 --> 00:34:32,821
working to bang their
kidnapped daughter.

00:34:32,888 --> 00:34:34,856
We got... did I leave
anything out?

00:34:34,923 --> 00:34:36,458
Oh, yeah, we got your gun.

00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:38,960
I don't own a gun.

00:34:39,027 --> 00:34:41,563
No, you know, we checked
the serial number.

00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:42,697
It belongs to
your grandmother.

00:34:42,764 --> 00:34:44,433
(chuckling):
But you know...

00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:46,802
And you know, it must be
really hard to get that gun

00:34:46,868 --> 00:34:48,036
off ol' granny.

00:34:48,103 --> 00:34:49,271
What the hell
are you doing?

00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:50,372
I'm just checking
your shirt size.

00:34:50,439 --> 00:34:52,641
I might want to give you
a Christmas present.

00:34:52,707 --> 00:34:54,576
17 1/2, 36.

00:34:54,643 --> 00:34:55,777
You know what?

00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:58,113
I was leaving
something out, Wolf.

00:34:59,114 --> 00:35:01,016
We got your shirt

00:35:01,083 --> 00:35:05,053
soaked not in one but both
of the victims' blood.

00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,989
You see, this is what
we call a slam dunk.

00:35:08,056 --> 00:35:09,391
You're going
to jail.

00:35:09,458 --> 00:35:10,959
You're going
to do time.

00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:12,994
But why do it alone?

00:35:13,061 --> 00:35:15,397
Don't be a patsy.

00:35:15,464 --> 00:35:18,467
Just tell us the
name of your partner.

00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:19,901
Come on, share
with a friend.

00:35:19,968 --> 00:35:21,036
And you know what?

00:35:21,103 --> 00:35:22,738
You don't even have
to tell me his name.

00:35:22,804 --> 00:35:23,739
All you have

00:35:23,805 --> 00:35:25,807
to do... is point.

00:35:26,842 --> 00:35:29,211
Hmm?

00:35:29,277 --> 00:35:31,346
I've never seen
that guy before in my life.

00:35:31,413 --> 00:35:33,648
Come on, you can do
better than that.

00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:35,217
I want a lawyer.

00:36:13,121 --> 00:36:14,289
Hey.

00:36:14,356 --> 00:36:18,060
I'm trying to make some
sense out of the spatter.

00:36:18,126 --> 00:36:20,062
Now, we've already
determined that the...

00:36:20,128 --> 00:36:21,663
the killer rolled up
his sleeves

00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:23,665
when he murdered
the motel victims,

00:36:23,732 --> 00:36:25,400
but when I found the shirt,

00:36:25,467 --> 00:36:26,768
the cuffs were buttoned,

00:36:26,835 --> 00:36:29,905
and I'm not much bigger
than this guy.

00:36:29,971 --> 00:36:31,173
And look.

00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:33,075
This is as far
as the sleeves go up.

00:36:35,077 --> 00:36:37,879
Would you give me the
shirt off your back?

00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:40,048
Sure.

00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:44,019
(quietly):
Here you go.

00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:51,460
Okay.

00:36:56,298 --> 00:36:58,066
Easy.

00:36:58,133 --> 00:37:01,002
So Wolflynn wasn't wearing
the shirt, was he?

00:37:01,069 --> 00:37:04,039
I guess Amy was.

00:37:04,106 --> 00:37:05,540
A trophy after sex.

00:37:05,607 --> 00:37:08,276
Hey.

00:37:08,343 --> 00:37:11,213
I have something
I'd like you to see.

00:37:11,279 --> 00:37:13,315
The Macalino
family computer

00:37:13,381 --> 00:37:15,250
was recovered from
the stolen car.

00:37:15,317 --> 00:37:16,585
Archie...

00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:19,821
found the chat logs.

00:37:19,888 --> 00:37:21,056
A lot of traffic
between Amy

00:37:21,123 --> 00:37:22,224
and the "Wolfman."

00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:23,325
Keep reading.

00:37:31,032 --> 00:37:33,735
It looks
like Amy's luring the Wolfman.

00:37:33,802 --> 00:37:35,437
What would you do
if you found this

00:37:35,504 --> 00:37:36,671
on Lindsey's computer?

WILLOWS:
Ground her for life.

00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,476
Take the laptop.

00:37:41,543 --> 00:37:45,781
Lock her in
the attic, maybe?

00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:48,016
Well, you push kids,
they push back.

00:37:48,083 --> 00:37:49,651
Things can get
out of hand pretty quick.

00:37:49,718 --> 00:37:52,287
The Macalinos were pushed
all the way to an exorcism.

Now, Alistair Rhodes

00:37:56,324 --> 00:37:58,727
says that he left the motel
when his ritual failed.

00:37:58,794 --> 00:38:01,997
The video shows the father
tried to stop it.

00:38:02,064 --> 00:38:04,266
He probably untied her.

00:38:04,332 --> 00:38:05,267
Right?

00:38:05,333 --> 00:38:08,136
So Amy escapes,

00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:11,673
she goes and gets
her knight in shining armor.

00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:13,075
Yeah, Wolf and his .22 caliber.

00:38:13,141 --> 00:38:15,410
They return to the motel.

00:38:15,477 --> 00:38:19,414
The parents are gone,
but the room's still paid for.

00:38:19,481 --> 00:38:22,918
They have sex and burgers.

00:38:22,984 --> 00:38:25,520
And Amy calls her mom and dad,

00:38:25,587 --> 00:38:27,622
who come back
because they still love her.

00:38:27,689 --> 00:38:32,127
Dad gets killed first... quick,
but mom,

00:38:32,194 --> 00:38:33,595
the true believer,

00:38:33,662 --> 00:38:37,632
the one who wanted
to drive out the demons,

00:38:37,699 --> 00:38:39,067
she has to suffer.

00:38:42,571 --> 00:38:44,639
And Amy goes home
to get her computer...

00:38:46,441 --> 00:38:49,010
...and kills her little sister.

00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:50,178
I'll call Brass.

00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:52,748
We'll go pick Amy up.

00:39:06,027 --> 00:39:08,029

00:39:09,064 --> 00:39:11,867
Amy, there's somebody
here to see you.

00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:14,803
Could you come
with me, please?

00:39:23,779 --> 00:39:25,781
