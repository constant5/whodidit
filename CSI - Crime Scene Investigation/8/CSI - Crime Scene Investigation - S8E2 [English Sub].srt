00:12:12,161 --> 00:12:14,463
Got blood on the chair.

00:12:19,268 --> 00:12:21,236
Blood on the tablecloth.

00:12:25,641 --> 00:12:26,975
Blood drops on the floor,

00:12:27,042 --> 00:12:30,646
leading away from Hux's chair.

00:12:30,712 --> 00:12:33,615
Stab him. Extract the weapon.

00:12:33,682 --> 00:12:34,883
Drip, drip, drip.

00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:37,719
And they end here.

00:12:37,786 --> 00:12:40,155
Near Ms. Shasta.

00:12:40,222 --> 00:12:41,824
WOMAN:
<i>Shasta McCloud--</i>

00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:45,227
big "M," little "c,"
big "C," plus "loud."

00:12:45,294 --> 00:12:47,129
McCloud.
(chuckles)

00:12:47,196 --> 00:12:49,631
On TV, they never show anyone
bleeding from a heart attack.

00:12:49,698 --> 00:12:51,099
Is that what
you think happened?

00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,335
Well, yeah. I mean, all
that Prevalis and diet soda.

00:12:53,402 --> 00:12:54,336
I just figured...

00:12:54,403 --> 00:12:56,472
April, shh!

00:12:56,538 --> 00:12:59,141
He was an animal
until the day he died, sir.

00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:00,142
Uh-huh.

00:13:00,209 --> 00:13:02,311
Wait a minute.
What did happen?

00:13:02,377 --> 00:13:04,413
Well-Well, you're
the one with blood on you.

00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,814
Maybe you can tell me.

00:13:05,881 --> 00:13:07,082
I thought
he just fell asleep

00:13:07,149 --> 00:13:08,450
like he always does
at the end of meals.

00:13:08,517 --> 00:13:11,753
APRIL:
Come on! Wake up, Huxey.

00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,789
(in animated voice):
Wake up, Huxey.

00:13:13,856 --> 00:13:15,591
Wake up, Huxey-Hux.

00:13:15,657 --> 00:13:16,992
Come on, it's time to go.

00:13:17,059 --> 00:13:18,160
Meow, meow!

00:13:18,227 --> 00:13:19,528
Meow, meow!

00:13:19,595 --> 00:13:21,663
(kissing noises)

00:13:24,066 --> 00:13:26,969
(whimpering)

00:13:27,035 --> 00:13:28,770
Waiter!

00:13:28,837 --> 00:13:30,772
Emergency!
April?
April, what's wrong?!

00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:32,174
Call 9-1-1!
Help!
April! April!

00:13:32,241 --> 00:13:33,509
Michael here.

00:13:33,575 --> 00:13:34,843
Code red!

00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:38,213
(screaming)
Help! Help us!

00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:42,017
Okay. Um, look, I'm going
to need to take your sweater.

00:13:42,084 --> 00:13:44,419
Yeah, like I haven't
heard <i>that</i> one before.

00:13:44,486 --> 00:13:47,956
(giggles)
No. No, I don't mean
right now.

00:13:48,023 --> 00:13:50,459
No, I mean, I... I'll need
to take it before I go.

00:13:50,526 --> 00:13:52,060
You know, later, when I,
when I leave,

00:13:52,127 --> 00:13:53,362
I have to take
your sweater then.

00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:02,871
Mr. Bartley?

00:14:05,207 --> 00:14:08,377
Matt. I'm Vincent's brother.

00:14:08,443 --> 00:14:10,546
I'm... Nick.

00:14:10,612 --> 00:14:11,947
Stokes.

00:14:12,948 --> 00:14:14,516
Uh...

00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,418
You don't need
to say it.

00:14:16,485 --> 00:14:19,154
I knew when the detective 
asked me for that safe-kit

00:14:19,221 --> 00:14:20,889
that it was going to be Vinnie.

00:14:20,956 --> 00:14:23,926
Shouldn't I be talking 
to your parents?

00:14:23,992 --> 00:14:25,594
Don't have any parents.

00:14:25,661 --> 00:14:27,696
Mom skipped out
when we were little,

00:14:27,763 --> 00:14:30,499
and Dad died a
couple years ago.

00:14:30,566 --> 00:14:32,234
It's just the two of us.

00:14:33,836 --> 00:14:35,671
Matt...

00:14:35,737 --> 00:14:37,906
your brother wasn't
on the football team,

00:14:37,973 --> 00:14:39,975
but when we found him,

00:14:40,042 --> 00:14:41,443
he was wearing
a football helmet.

00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:42,778
Why is that?

00:14:42,845 --> 00:14:44,613
It was my old helmet.

00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,081
Is that how you got injured?

00:14:46,148 --> 00:14:48,150
No.

00:14:48,217 --> 00:14:51,153
It was the last day
of spring break, and...

00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,255
I was wasted.

00:14:53,322 --> 00:14:55,457
Like a dumb-ass,

00:14:55,524 --> 00:14:57,326
I dove into the Tangiers
wave pool headfirst.

00:14:59,194 --> 00:15:01,130
Fractured my T-1 vertebra.

00:15:01,196 --> 00:15:03,365
So why the helmet?

00:15:03,432 --> 00:15:06,502
Well, I was a pretty good
football player.

00:15:08,937 --> 00:15:11,507
He was proud of that.

00:15:11,573 --> 00:15:14,243
That and my dad's dragon belt.

00:15:14,309 --> 00:15:18,180
He got it when he
was in the service.

00:15:18,247 --> 00:15:20,382
Vinnie wears
it every day.

00:15:20,449 --> 00:15:24,353
It's just something
that he has to hold onto...

00:15:24,419 --> 00:15:25,787
(voice breaks) ...to deal with.

00:15:25,854 --> 00:15:27,489
(softly):
Yeah.

00:15:27,556 --> 00:15:31,093
You know, one of these could've
been the murder weapon.

00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,795
It's approximate
in size and shape.

00:15:32,861 --> 00:15:35,697
And everybody had one.

00:15:45,574 --> 00:15:48,777
Well, something dripped over
here that is not blood.

00:15:48,844 --> 00:15:51,847
Well, could've been whatever
food was on the skewers.

00:15:51,914 --> 00:15:55,951
ALS will pick up anything
that's fatty or dairy-based.

00:16:11,533 --> 00:16:14,236
Could you turn off the
lights for a second?

00:16:18,941 --> 00:16:19,875
(lights click off)

00:16:19,942 --> 00:16:22,878
(Willows chuckles)

00:16:22,945 --> 00:16:27,349
I'm sorry, but this is a stupid
idea for a restaurant.

00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:29,184
I need to see what I'm eating.

00:16:32,054 --> 00:16:35,123
BROWN:
I can see just fine.

00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:36,625
Where are you?

00:16:36,692 --> 00:16:38,327
Right here.

00:16:38,393 --> 00:16:40,929
Oh.

00:16:42,431 --> 00:16:44,066
(lights click on)

00:16:44,133 --> 00:16:46,802
Hi.
Hello.

00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:49,771
Night vision goggles?

00:16:49,838 --> 00:16:52,207
Yeah, someone
left these behind.

00:16:52,274 --> 00:16:56,311
Kind of defeats the purpose
of dining in the dark.

00:16:56,378 --> 00:16:59,214
Unless you don't come
here for the food.

00:16:59,281 --> 00:17:01,750
(indistinct voices)

00:17:01,817 --> 00:17:03,552
BROWN:
Mr. Nivens.

00:17:03,619 --> 00:17:07,289
Are these yours?

00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,195
I'll take that as a "yes."

00:17:16,165 --> 00:17:18,433
Wait, wait... I
didn't kill anyone.

00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,202
Then why would your bring
military-grade,

00:17:20,269 --> 00:17:22,271
night vision goggles
to the restaurant?

00:17:22,337 --> 00:17:23,972
A hunch.

00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,576
(man and woman
moaning erotically)

00:17:27,643 --> 00:17:29,044
MAN:
Yeah.

00:17:29,111 --> 00:17:30,879
Oh, that's so good.
Tastes so good

00:17:30,946 --> 00:17:34,750
NIVENS:
Sweetheart, you want to try
some of my steak?

00:17:36,151 --> 00:17:37,820
WOMAN:
No, thanks.

00:17:37,886 --> 00:17:40,322
I'm all good.

00:17:40,389 --> 00:17:43,025
Yeah...
(giggles)

00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,796
Mmm...

00:17:51,633 --> 00:17:53,602
Always be suspicious
when your wife wants

00:17:53,669 --> 00:17:55,971
to dine in the dark
with another couple.

00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:01,243
You brought night vision goggles
to spy on me during dinner?

00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:03,145
Damn right.

00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,082
(sighs)

00:18:09,985 --> 00:18:12,321
Millions of tires
wear out ever year.

00:18:12,387 --> 00:18:14,756
You ever wonder where
all that rubber dust goes?

00:18:14,823 --> 00:18:16,892
No, I don't.

00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:19,962
The black powder trace you found
in your victim's clothing

00:18:20,028 --> 00:18:21,697
was tire rubber.

00:18:21,763 --> 00:18:23,232
It's not surprising.

00:18:23,298 --> 00:18:24,700
we found the body on
the side of the highway.

00:18:24,766 --> 00:18:26,068
Of course
you would expect that.

00:18:26,135 --> 00:18:29,571
However, I did find some very
interesting type of rubber.

00:18:29,638 --> 00:18:31,573
Okay, Hodges, dazzle me.

00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,444
Truck tires have 27% isoprene
and 14% neoprene.

00:18:35,511 --> 00:18:36,979
That's what makes
them so hard.

00:18:37,045 --> 00:18:39,548
Passenger tires have a lower
isoprene-to-neoprene ratio,

00:18:39,615 --> 00:18:41,049
but they also have silica

00:18:41,116 --> 00:18:42,985
for fuel economy
and wet traction.

00:18:43,051 --> 00:18:46,021
<i>Go-cart tires, or "slicks,"</i>

00:18:46,088 --> 00:18:48,390
to those in the know,
have much higher levels

00:18:48,457 --> 00:18:49,825
of carbon black and oil,

00:18:49,892 --> 00:18:51,927
resulting in extremely
high traction.

00:18:51,994 --> 00:18:53,662
Guess I better
get my go-cart on.

00:18:53,729 --> 00:18:54,797
You know,
just so you know,

00:18:54,863 --> 00:18:57,366
I'm a bit of go-cart
enthusiast myself.

00:18:57,432 --> 00:18:59,434
Oh, uh...
that's awesome.

00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:09,044
Have you seen this guy before?

00:19:09,111 --> 00:19:11,013
Day before yesterday.

00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:13,515
Day before that,
and the day before that.

00:19:13,582 --> 00:19:15,417
Oh, man,
did he get in trouble?

00:19:15,484 --> 00:19:17,619
Are these the
race stats?

00:19:17,686 --> 00:19:18,654
Uh-huh.

00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,822
You keep record of them?

00:19:19,888 --> 00:19:21,623
Yeah, all in here.

00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:22,891
People ask for them every day

00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,693
like they're
some sort of trophy.

00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,196
Could you print out
Vincent Bartley's trophy

00:19:27,262 --> 00:19:28,697
from the last time
he was here?

00:19:28,764 --> 00:19:31,600
Yeah. But I'm not
getting him in trouble, am I?

00:19:31,667 --> 00:19:33,869
No.
No, not really.

00:19:33,936 --> 00:19:35,737
You know, when I was a kid,
we used to make these things

00:19:35,804 --> 00:19:38,340
out of lunch trays
and old lawn mower engines.

00:19:38,407 --> 00:19:40,576
When I was kid,
I used to make bombs,

00:19:40,642 --> 00:19:42,878
and origami.

00:19:42,945 --> 00:19:44,146
Oh.

00:19:44,213 --> 00:19:46,882
"Vinnie Vroom."
Won all three of his races.

00:19:46,949 --> 00:19:49,051
Beat out a guy named "Hot Rod."

00:19:49,117 --> 00:19:52,221
Vinnie ran
circles around him.

00:19:52,287 --> 00:19:55,724
♪ ♪

00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,302
♪ ♪

00:20:14,343 --> 00:20:15,277
Yes.

00:20:15,344 --> 00:20:18,013
Yes. Yes, is
that all you got?

00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,148
Is that all you got?

00:20:19,214 --> 00:20:20,449
Is that all you got?
Is that all you got?

00:20:20,516 --> 00:20:22,584
Is that all you got?
Is that all you got?

00:20:22,651 --> 00:20:26,622
Rodney went from being A-Rod
to being No-Rod.

00:20:26,688 --> 00:20:29,558
Hey, there he is,
right there.

00:20:31,026 --> 00:20:33,262
Aw, come on.
Hey, if you guys want to race,

00:20:33,328 --> 00:20:34,396
then you guys have
to wear dresses, huh?

00:20:34,463 --> 00:20:35,764
Get your skill
up, all right.

00:20:35,831 --> 00:20:38,000
I need some
competition here.
Hot Rod!

00:20:41,703 --> 00:20:43,272
(growls)

00:21:02,825 --> 00:21:03,826
Get out of the truck!

00:21:03,892 --> 00:21:05,427
Get out of the truck now!

00:21:05,494 --> 00:21:09,531
Get out of
the truck now!

00:21:09,598 --> 00:21:11,467
Nothing says
"I'm guilty"

00:21:11,533 --> 00:21:13,569
like running from the cops,
dumb-ass.

00:21:13,635 --> 00:21:15,771
Give me his wallet.

00:21:18,073 --> 00:21:20,476
Rodney Banks.

00:21:20,542 --> 00:21:22,845
We're with the Vegas Crime Lab,
Mr. Banks.

00:21:22,911 --> 00:21:24,346
Hey, I didn't do nothing.

00:21:24,413 --> 00:21:25,681
You got quite a mess here, Rod.

00:21:25,747 --> 00:21:28,016
Mind if I take a look?

00:21:34,089 --> 00:21:35,357
Where'd you get that belt?

00:21:35,424 --> 00:21:36,458
I don't know.

00:21:36,525 --> 00:21:38,460
Where?
I don't know.

00:21:40,996 --> 00:21:42,764
Blood.

00:21:42,831 --> 00:21:45,834
Looks like things just got
a lot hotter for you, Rod.

00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:51,240
(camera shutter clicks)

00:22:00,983 --> 00:22:04,486
All skewers accounted for,
none of them bloody.

00:22:04,553 --> 00:22:06,922
We've got a
high-profile dead guy

00:22:06,989 --> 00:22:08,624
in a locked-room
situation,

00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:13,529
with 16 diners
and three blind waiters.

00:22:13,595 --> 00:22:15,464
Give me something.

00:22:15,531 --> 00:22:18,834
How about a Band-Aid
with petals?

Whoever did it
ditched the pen in my bag.

00:32:16,821 --> 00:32:18,823
It was on the back of my chair
the whole time.

00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:19,991
It could have been anyone.

00:32:20,057 --> 00:32:21,692
What about the guy
who assaulted me?

00:32:21,759 --> 00:32:23,761
SHASTA:
Look, if you really
want a suspect,

00:32:23,828 --> 00:32:26,364
you need to check out
little miss chef lady.

00:32:26,431 --> 00:32:28,166
Little miss chef lady?

00:32:28,232 --> 00:32:29,700
Why is that?
Hello.

00:32:29,767 --> 00:32:32,103
Duh, she's...
Winter Issue?

00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:33,604
1995.

00:32:33,671 --> 00:32:39,210
You certainly weren't hiding
anything back then.

00:32:39,277 --> 00:32:41,813
Hmm?

00:32:41,879 --> 00:32:46,284
Ms. Sanchez, according
to your fellow Kitties,

00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:49,087
you and Huxley
had a falling out.

00:32:49,153 --> 00:32:51,889
It's curious that you
didn't mention that.

00:32:51,956 --> 00:32:56,394
I didn't mention it,
because it's ancient history.

00:32:56,461 --> 00:33:00,264
12 years ago, a misogynist
told me I should eat less.

00:33:00,331 --> 00:33:03,401
And today, I now have a hot
restaurant on the Strip

00:33:03,468 --> 00:33:06,871
and two contracts for
spots in L.A. and Chicago.

00:33:06,938 --> 00:33:10,108
"Food Seduction"
is a best-seller.

00:33:10,174 --> 00:33:12,944
I think I won that
battle already.

00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:16,481
So, did you and Huxley speak
to each other last night?

00:33:16,547 --> 00:33:19,717
His reservation was
booked under a pseudonym.

00:33:19,784 --> 00:33:21,652
I didn't even
know he was there.

00:33:24,021 --> 00:33:25,990
Mr. Brass,

00:33:26,057 --> 00:33:28,359
do you know why
I started my restaurant?

00:33:28,426 --> 00:33:30,461
No. Tell me.

00:33:30,528 --> 00:33:34,999
Because I fell in love
with a blind man.

00:33:35,066 --> 00:33:39,403
He would turn off the lights
and feed me.

00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:43,775
When you deprive one sense,
other senses are heightened.

00:33:43,841 --> 00:33:46,344
My only focus was on my tongue.

00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:48,913
It was brilliant.

00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:51,382
And then he died.

00:33:51,449 --> 00:33:54,152
And this restaurant
is an homage to him.

00:33:54,218 --> 00:33:56,888
To our love affair.

00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:01,292
How nice for you.

00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:05,029
I don't mean to be crude,
but a murder is,

00:34:05,096 --> 00:34:10,001
quite frankly,
bad for business.

00:34:14,755 --> 00:34:16,957

(paper rustling)

00:35:20,787 --> 00:35:21,955
Hey.
Hey.

00:35:22,022 --> 00:35:22,990
So, Huxley had

00:35:23,056 --> 00:35:24,691
honey on his hairpiece,

00:35:24,758 --> 00:35:26,994
ink in his brain
and blood all over.

00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,329
There were three people
who had honey on their hands:

00:35:29,396 --> 00:35:31,365
the frisky couple
and Michael.

00:35:31,431 --> 00:35:33,233
Two people who had blood
on their clothing:

00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,501
April and Michael.

00:35:34,568 --> 00:35:36,403
And there was a total of five
people moving around the room:

00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:38,505
two Manducci brothers
and all three waiters.

00:35:38,572 --> 00:35:40,707
Now, that's a lot of lists
for Michael to turn up on.

00:35:40,774 --> 00:35:43,510
He does work there,
so there's reason for it, but...

00:35:43,577 --> 00:35:45,946
Well, there's no
reason for this.

00:35:46,013 --> 00:35:48,815
Michael's print in
ink, on a napkin.

00:35:48,882 --> 00:35:51,852
What would he have
against Huxley?

00:35:51,919 --> 00:35:53,921
His prints hit back
to an old work card.

00:35:53,987 --> 00:35:55,689
The guy used to be a chef.

00:35:55,756 --> 00:35:56,690
A blind chef?

00:35:56,757 --> 00:35:58,792
He lost his sight
a few years back.

00:35:58,859 --> 00:36:01,528
But before that,
guess who was his sous-chef?

00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:05,265
"The man knew his way
around a kitchen,

00:36:05,332 --> 00:36:07,501
"and his way into my heart.

00:36:07,568 --> 00:36:11,104
"Michael would spend hours
teaching me,

00:36:11,171 --> 00:36:14,675
feeding me... loving me."

00:36:14,741 --> 00:36:16,577
So, you're the dead guy?

00:36:16,643 --> 00:36:19,580
She seduces me,

00:36:19,646 --> 00:36:23,016
steals my recipes, my
ideas, my investors.

00:36:23,083 --> 00:36:25,586
And then she hires me
as a freaking waiter.

00:36:25,652 --> 00:36:28,255
Night after night,
I listen to her

00:36:28,322 --> 00:36:31,058
tell stories
of the tragic love affair,

00:36:31,124 --> 00:36:34,595
of the poor, dead blind guy.

00:36:34,661 --> 00:36:37,431
Last night,
I finally confronted her.

00:36:38,465 --> 00:36:40,267
I deserve a piece of the action.

00:36:40,334 --> 00:36:41,768
At $200 a head,

00:36:41,835 --> 00:36:44,238
you're clearing at least
$1,000 in tips at night.

00:36:44,304 --> 00:36:46,807
That's a lot of action
for a blind man.

00:36:46,874 --> 00:36:48,442
I made you.

00:36:48,508 --> 00:36:49,543
You're fired.

00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:51,311
We're done.

00:36:53,814 --> 00:36:55,315
But why kill Huxley?

00:36:55,382 --> 00:36:56,650
Why not just her?

00:36:56,717 --> 00:37:00,020
I'm blind. She's not.

00:37:00,087 --> 00:37:03,323
But in that dining room,
everybody else is blind, too.

00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:05,559
And when Huxley walked
in with his Kitties,

00:37:05,626 --> 00:37:09,162
it was like a sign
from the gods.

00:37:09,229 --> 00:37:13,534
I knew I could destroy
her and the restaurant.

00:37:15,536 --> 00:37:17,905
<i>I waited till</i>
<i>the oyster course.</i>

00:37:17,971 --> 00:37:20,507
<i>The shells clanging,</i>
<i>and slurping,</i>

00:37:20,574 --> 00:37:22,109
<i>the "oohing," the "aahing,"</i>

00:37:22,175 --> 00:37:26,813
<i>I knew it would cover</i>
<i>any noise I was going to make.</i>

00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:32,119
(gasps)

00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:39,326
I wanted her rotting in jail,
eating bologna sandwiches.

00:37:42,062 --> 00:37:44,231
If you wanted to frame Pippa,

00:37:44,298 --> 00:37:47,301
why did you plant the pen
in Shasta's purse?

00:37:47,367 --> 00:37:49,570
I tell everyone to put
their purses and jackets

00:37:49,636 --> 00:37:50,837
on the back of the chairs,

00:37:50,904 --> 00:37:53,540
so I knew exactly
where her purse was.

00:38:04,918 --> 00:38:08,555
Old cat frames young Kitty.

00:38:08,622 --> 00:38:12,526
Kind of perfect.

SANDERS:
<i>We found high velocity</i>

00:38:15,596 --> 00:38:18,899
inside the rear wheel well
of the victim's cart,

00:38:18,966 --> 00:38:21,034
which means he lost
his head at high speed.

00:38:21,101 --> 00:38:23,303
So how did Hot Rod
decapitate Vinnie

00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:25,539
while racing down a highway
at 60 miles an hour?

00:38:25,606 --> 00:38:27,975
Maybe he didn't.

00:38:28,041 --> 00:38:31,578
Well, people's heads just don't
fly off for no reason.

00:38:31,645 --> 00:38:35,048
Maybe we should check the scene
for some wires or branches,

00:38:35,115 --> 00:38:36,783
or something he
could've run into.

00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:38,252
If it would've
happened that way,

00:38:38,318 --> 00:38:39,920
we would've found trace
from whatever did it.

00:38:39,987 --> 00:38:42,789
The only trace in the neck
and arm wounds

00:38:42,856 --> 00:38:44,491
was rubber from truck tires.

00:38:44,558 --> 00:38:46,793
Which was present on both sides
of his wounds

00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,195
but not on his clothing.

00:38:48,262 --> 00:38:50,597
There were blown out tire
fragments all over the road.

00:38:50,664 --> 00:38:52,633
But we found his body
off the road.

00:38:52,699 --> 00:38:55,369
There shouldn't be any transfer
from truck tires.

00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:59,873
Unless...

00:39:02,809 --> 00:39:05,812
(machine humming)

00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:15,622
What's going on here?

00:39:15,689 --> 00:39:17,324
We're trying to determine

00:39:17,391 --> 00:39:19,226
whether a steel-belted
truck tire

00:39:19,293 --> 00:39:22,696
can decapitate a kid
driving a go-cart.

00:39:22,763 --> 00:39:24,865
I thought that was
an urban myth.

00:39:24,932 --> 00:39:27,134
Myths, legends, tall tales--

00:39:27,201 --> 00:39:29,536
they all come
from something real.

00:39:29,603 --> 00:39:31,138
If that go-cart was going
60 miles an hour

00:39:31,205 --> 00:39:33,106
drafting a truck
going the same speed,

00:39:33,173 --> 00:39:34,675
and that truck blows a tire

00:39:34,741 --> 00:39:36,810
sending a two-pound projectile
into the driver's neck...

00:39:36,877 --> 00:39:40,047
The combined speed of impact
would be 120 miles an hour.

00:39:40,113 --> 00:39:43,150
Which is about...
962 foot-pounds
of energy.

00:39:43,217 --> 00:39:45,252
All right, let's go, fellas.

00:39:50,057 --> 00:39:53,093
Come on, Conrad.
There's always room for Jell-O.

00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,828
It's expensive Jell-o.

00:39:54,895 --> 00:39:57,798

See if we can't reuse
some of that.

00:40:38,739 --> 00:40:41,008
When did you tell
Ecklie we got involved?

00:40:42,042 --> 00:40:45,078
Two years ago.

00:40:45,145 --> 00:40:47,447
Why? What did you tell him?

00:40:47,514 --> 00:40:50,284
Nine years ago.

00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:53,287

00:40:59,826 --> 00:41:01,895

many questions

00:41:01,962 --> 00:41:04,031
about anthropology
for some reason.

00:41:04,097 --> 00:41:05,699
Well, I was stalling.

00:41:05,766 --> 00:41:08,502
I was trying to get the nerve
to ask you to dinner.

00:41:11,171 --> 00:41:12,839
You had a ponytail.

00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:22,516
I'm going to move to Swing.

00:41:22,583 --> 00:41:24,585
We talked about this.

00:41:24,651 --> 00:41:26,253
I know that you said
that you would do it,

00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,922
but I don't want to do that
to the team.

00:41:28,989 --> 00:41:31,291
Besides...

00:41:31,358 --> 00:41:36,029
I am sure that I could use
more daylight in my life.

00:41:44,338 --> 00:41:48,041
We should go.
