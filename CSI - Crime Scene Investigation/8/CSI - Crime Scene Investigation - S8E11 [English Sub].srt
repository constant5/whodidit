ANNOUNCER:
Welcome to PBR Finals
in Las Vegas.

00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:05,875
For two weekends,
we have 45 riders

00:02:05,942 --> 00:02:07,710
competing in a race
for the world title.

00:02:07,777 --> 00:02:10,458
The world champion goes home
with a million bucks.

00:02:10,524 --> 00:02:11,826
You want to talk about pressure?

00:02:11,892 --> 00:02:13,294
It's all in Las Vegas.

00:02:13,361 --> 00:02:16,764
Next up, Cody Latshaw 
riding Wintwister,

00:02:16,831 --> 00:02:19,767
one of the finest bovine
athletes in the world today--

00:02:19,834 --> 00:02:22,336
a champ among champions.

00:02:27,174 --> 00:02:30,978
(crowd cheering)

00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:48,362
ANNOUNCER:
Ladies and gentlemen,
right in your seat, right now,

00:02:48,429 --> 00:02:50,865
do what you can,
spiritually, to help Cody.

00:02:50,932 --> 00:02:55,469
Cody. Hey, Cody, you all right?

00:02:55,536 --> 00:02:57,438
You okay?
Get a stretcher.

00:02:57,505 --> 00:02:58,506
Get a stretcher!

00:02:58,572 --> 00:02:59,874
I don't need a stretcher.

00:02:59,941 --> 00:03:01,442
You sure?
I'm okay.

00:03:01,509 --> 00:03:02,877
Just give me a hand.

00:03:02,944 --> 00:03:04,412
All right. Here we go.

00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:09,183
(crowd cheering)

00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,986
Re-ride!

00:03:12,053 --> 00:03:15,523
(cheering)

00:03:15,589 --> 00:03:18,559
ANNOUNCER:
This is why we call him Lazarus,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:03:18,626 --> 00:03:20,861
Knock him down,
and he rises again.

00:03:20,928 --> 00:03:22,496
What an athlete!

00:03:22,563 --> 00:03:24,865
What a hero!

00:03:34,909 --> 00:03:36,344
So, who found him?

00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:38,145
Security.

00:03:38,212 --> 00:03:40,414
We have a tough time
finding guys to wrangle a bull.

00:03:40,481 --> 00:03:44,251
Cowboys like to party
when they come to Vegas.

00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:46,053
Did you see anything?

00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,323
No, we just put the bull
back in the pen.

00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:51,659
Ty Murray,
PBR president.

00:03:51,726 --> 00:03:53,027
And seven-time world champ.

00:03:53,094 --> 00:03:54,061
Okay, Dustin.

00:03:54,128 --> 00:03:55,229
Jim Brass, Vegas PD.

00:03:55,296 --> 00:03:57,164
Nice to meet you.
Gil Grissom, Crime Lab.

00:03:57,231 --> 00:03:58,432
Nice to meet you.

00:03:58,499 --> 00:04:00,234
BRASS:
What can you tell me
about this guy?

00:04:00,301 --> 00:04:02,503
Cody Latshaw,
a real institution.

00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:05,072
Most guys his age hung up
their rope a long time ago.

00:04:05,139 --> 00:04:06,907
What about the bull?

00:04:06,974 --> 00:04:09,243
Wintwister-- he threw Cody
earlier tonight,

00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,945
but he got up and was fine.

00:04:11,012 --> 00:04:12,179
He even asked for a re-ride.

00:04:12,246 --> 00:04:13,948
"Re-ride"?
Well, if a bull

00:04:14,015 --> 00:04:15,016
doesn't buck good enough,

00:04:15,082 --> 00:04:16,651
they can ask
to get on another one.

00:04:16,717 --> 00:04:17,918
That wasn't the case.

00:04:17,985 --> 00:04:19,220
Wintwister had a good day.

00:04:19,287 --> 00:04:21,355
Cody must not have been
in his right mind

00:04:21,422 --> 00:04:23,257
to think he'd get
a second shot.

00:04:24,692 --> 00:04:26,627
Is this the rope
they tie around the bull?

00:04:26,694 --> 00:04:27,795
That's one of them.

00:04:27,862 --> 00:04:28,996
That's the bull rope.

00:04:32,767 --> 00:04:34,235
Looks like it's got rosin on it.

00:04:34,302 --> 00:04:35,469
Yeah, it helps the rope

00:04:35,536 --> 00:04:37,571
stick to the glove
so they can get a good grip.

00:04:37,638 --> 00:04:38,606
Do all the riders

00:04:38,673 --> 00:04:39,941
wear a glove?

00:04:40,007 --> 00:04:40,975
Yes, sir.

00:04:41,042 --> 00:04:42,777
He's not

00:04:42,843 --> 00:04:44,478
wearing one.

00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,849
Guy was living
the American dream.

00:04:50,117 --> 00:04:52,353
Every kid wants
to grow up to be a cowboy.

00:04:53,387 --> 00:04:55,823
Not a dead cowboy.

Catherine.

00:05:35,992 --> 00:05:38,362
Hi.

00:05:38,428 --> 00:05:41,131
PBR Sports Medicine
just sent this over.

00:05:41,198 --> 00:05:44,034
Taken after Cody's fall
in competition.

00:05:46,536 --> 00:05:48,538
Hmm.

00:05:48,605 --> 00:05:50,974
He was held together
by every kind of hardware

00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:52,376
but roofing nails.

00:05:52,442 --> 00:05:53,977
I can relate.

00:05:54,044 --> 00:05:55,145
Yeah, it's a
violent sport.

00:05:55,212 --> 00:05:56,713
Check out his hand.

00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:00,751
Riders live with constant
injuries and pain.

00:06:00,817 --> 00:06:03,687
They always get
on that next bull

00:06:03,754 --> 00:06:06,256
and try like hell to hang on
for the next eight seconds.

00:06:06,323 --> 00:06:08,792
You sound like a fan.

00:06:08,859 --> 00:06:10,994
I used to date a bull rider.

00:06:11,061 --> 00:06:12,295
Cowboy up.

00:06:12,362 --> 00:06:13,930
PHILLIPS:
Here you go.

00:06:13,997 --> 00:06:15,365
Hey.
These are the ones I took.

00:06:15,432 --> 00:06:17,234
Thank you.

00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,436
So there's just a few
bills in his pockets.

00:06:19,503 --> 00:06:21,505
David, why don't you give
me a hand here?
Oh, sure.

00:06:21,571 --> 00:06:23,373
Some guys keep valuables
in their boots.

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,269
Cody's little doggies
are right fragrant.

00:06:31,336 --> 00:06:33,472
Catherine, take a look at this.

00:06:36,975 --> 00:06:38,310
This X-ray shows

00:06:38,377 --> 00:06:40,445
he walked away
from his earlier fall

00:06:40,512 --> 00:06:43,248
with a hairline fracture
of the C1 vertebra.

00:06:43,315 --> 00:06:45,317
(cheering)

00:06:49,121 --> 00:06:51,089
<i>In bull riding,</i>

00:06:51,156 --> 00:06:53,892
<i>the rider's spine must sustain</i>
<i>vertical, horizontal</i>

00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:55,594
<i>and diagonal thrust,</i>

00:06:55,661 --> 00:06:59,164
<i>together if they put tremendous</i>
<i>force onto the spinal column.</i>

00:07:00,766 --> 00:07:02,334
(bull grunting)

00:07:14,846 --> 00:07:16,281
That guy was
a walking time bomb.

00:07:16,348 --> 00:07:18,884
Any trauma with sufficient force

00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,419
would snap that vertebra

00:07:20,485 --> 00:07:21,887
and sever the
spinal cord.

00:07:21,953 --> 00:07:23,255
It did.

00:07:23,322 --> 00:07:25,157
The film David just took

00:07:25,223 --> 00:07:27,225
shows a complete fracture.

00:07:28,627 --> 00:07:29,995
That's your COD.

00:07:30,062 --> 00:07:32,597
Consistent with getting
thrown a second time.

00:07:32,664 --> 00:07:34,599
Hey!

00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:36,435
You got anything to do
with taking my bull

00:07:36,501 --> 00:07:37,836
off tomorrow's day sheet?

00:07:37,903 --> 00:07:39,004
Do you own the bull?

00:07:39,071 --> 00:07:40,772
Yeah, I'm Nancy Twicker.

00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:42,407
And I want my bull
in the finals.

00:07:42,474 --> 00:07:43,909
The more he bucks,
the more he's worth.

00:07:43,975 --> 00:07:46,411
So whatever you got
to do to clear him,

00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:47,746
get it done.

00:07:47,813 --> 00:07:50,166
Your bull gave Cody Latshaw
a pretty brutal beating.

00:07:50,233 --> 00:07:51,668
It's not the bull's fault.

00:07:51,734 --> 00:07:54,170
I blame Cody for taking
him out after hours.

00:07:54,237 --> 00:07:56,639
Is it true that some riders
tie the bull's testicles

00:07:56,706 --> 00:07:57,874
to get them to buck more?

00:07:57,941 --> 00:08:00,109
Well, sure, we always
want the bulls to buck.

00:08:00,176 --> 00:08:01,978
That's why we tie a flank
strap across their back.

00:08:02,045 --> 00:08:03,212
They're trying
to shake it off.

00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:04,280
Think about it.

00:08:04,347 --> 00:08:06,883
If I tied a rope
around your testicles,

00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,952
would you feel like
jumping up and down?

00:08:10,687 --> 00:08:11,821
Could a guy

00:08:11,888 --> 00:08:14,157
get a bull out of this chute
without any help?

00:08:14,223 --> 00:08:15,358
Well, one guy
could get a bull

00:08:15,425 --> 00:08:16,893
all the way to the
bucking chute, sure,

00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,096
<i>but well, then he'd have</i>
<i>to tie on the bull rope</i>

00:08:20,163 --> 00:08:21,598
<i>and the flank strap.</i>
<i>Then he'd have</i>

00:08:21,664 --> 00:08:23,666
to get on the bull.
And open the gate.

00:08:23,733 --> 00:08:25,101
TWICKER:
Not without help.

00:08:25,168 --> 00:08:27,503
<i>The chute only opens</i>
<i>from the outside.</i>

00:08:30,373 --> 00:08:32,976
I'm going to need
to process your bull.

00:08:33,042 --> 00:08:35,111
Can you do it in eight seconds?

00:08:35,178 --> 00:08:37,146
Even confined like this,

00:08:37,213 --> 00:08:38,915
these are not the most
cooperative creatures.

00:08:38,982 --> 00:08:40,917
So if my flank man
says get back, you jump.

00:08:40,984 --> 00:08:42,919
Hey, Cash.

00:08:42,986 --> 00:08:44,921
Howdy, Cash Dooley.

00:08:44,988 --> 00:08:47,257
And my name's
about the only cash I got.

00:08:47,323 --> 00:08:49,325
And this
is Wintwister?

00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,428
What, uh...

00:08:52,495 --> 00:08:54,230
What would be
the safest way

00:08:54,297 --> 00:08:55,832
for me to handle
his hooves?

00:08:55,899 --> 00:08:57,767
There ain't one.
Too dangerous.

00:08:57,834 --> 00:08:58,801
He's a kicker.

00:08:58,868 --> 00:09:00,003
Do you think I could get him

00:09:00,069 --> 00:09:01,304
to step on something?

00:09:01,371 --> 00:09:04,140
Sure. But you better
let me do the bending.

00:09:11,014 --> 00:09:13,016
Think you could get him
to step on this?

00:09:15,018 --> 00:09:16,486
TWICKER:
Cash knows bulls like nobody.

00:09:16,552 --> 00:09:18,621
Heck, before these kids
could even walk,

00:09:18,688 --> 00:09:21,090
they're out riding sheep,
then calves and baby bulls.

00:09:21,157 --> 00:09:23,026
And finally these one-ton,

00:09:23,092 --> 00:09:25,395
back-jerkin'
snot-slingin' monsters.

00:09:25,461 --> 00:09:27,230
Now, they get
all busted up

00:09:27,297 --> 00:09:29,632
and quit ridin', but they
just can't quit these animals.

00:09:38,575 --> 00:09:40,577
HODGES:
<i>Cotton fiber.</i>

00:09:42,545 --> 00:09:45,181
Appears to be bloodstained.

00:09:45,248 --> 00:09:47,417
I need another piece
for comparison.

00:09:49,886 --> 00:09:51,554
Forget how to use
the scissors?

00:09:51,621 --> 00:09:54,457
Put your fingers
in the holes and squeeze.

00:09:55,725 --> 00:09:57,460
Yes, ma'am.

00:10:08,738 --> 00:10:10,506
This looks like semen.

00:10:10,573 --> 00:10:12,408
Cowboy had a roll in the hay.

00:10:13,142 --> 00:10:14,410
Either he's messy

00:10:14,477 --> 00:10:18,181
or, uh, we could have
a <i>Brokeback Mountain</i> situation.

00:10:18,248 --> 00:10:19,916
Oh, God, that movie made me cry.

00:10:19,983 --> 00:10:21,384
Me, too.

00:10:22,852 --> 00:10:26,689
You know, it takes
a big man to admit that.

00:10:26,756 --> 00:10:28,791
And I am that man.

00:10:28,858 --> 00:10:30,526
You don't say?

00:10:30,593 --> 00:10:32,695
Fibers from the bull

00:10:32,762 --> 00:10:34,898
are consistent
with Cody's shirt.

00:10:36,766 --> 00:10:38,801
Looks like
Wintwister's a killer.

00:10:45,174 --> 00:10:47,176
(garbled radio transmission)

00:10:51,881 --> 00:10:53,816
Found her body

00:10:53,883 --> 00:10:55,351
on patrol,

00:10:55,418 --> 00:10:59,055
called in the 401AB,
apparent fatal.

00:10:59,122 --> 00:11:00,223
If there were
any eyewitnesses,

00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:02,792
they didn't
stick around.

00:11:02,859 --> 00:11:05,194
Okay, thanks.

00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,276
Here's the point of impact.

00:11:22,045 --> 00:11:24,247
Threw her that far, he must
have been going at least...

00:11:24,314 --> 00:11:26,616
45.

00:11:26,683 --> 00:11:29,686
Tiffany Rigdon, 27, local.

00:11:29,752 --> 00:11:31,254
OFFICER:
I'll run her for you.

00:11:31,321 --> 00:11:33,957
Thanks.

00:11:39,229 --> 00:11:42,098
Radiator fluid.

00:11:43,099 --> 00:11:46,569
Bunch of empty
liquor miniatures.

00:11:48,571 --> 00:11:51,274
Card key
from Pike's Gambling Hall.

00:11:51,341 --> 00:11:53,142
(camera shutter clicking)

00:11:53,209 --> 00:11:56,379
Hit-and-run.

00:11:56,446 --> 00:11:58,248
Hit back there...

00:12:03,353 --> 00:12:05,922
...ran over here.

00:12:32,815 --> 00:12:35,585
RO is Cody Latshaw--
Durant, Oklahoma.

00:12:35,652 --> 00:12:37,253
Isn't that
Grissom's dead cowboy?

00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,155
Yeah.

00:12:39,222 --> 00:12:41,024
Boy, he had a hell of a night.

00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:44,460
<i>He gets humiliated...</i>

00:12:45,495 --> 00:12:48,031
<i>...hits a pedestrian...</i>

00:12:48,097 --> 00:12:50,099
(tires screeching)

00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:53,403
...he ditches the car, walks a
couple of blocks to the arena,

00:12:53,469 --> 00:12:56,739
joyrides a bull, and then ends
up getting stomped to death?

00:12:58,341 --> 00:13:01,010
Here's another card key

00:13:01,077 --> 00:13:03,112
from Pike's Gambling Hall
right here.

00:13:08,251 --> 00:13:12,622
MAN:
First one's for room 810,
registered to Cody Latshaw.

00:13:13,623 --> 00:13:15,658
Here you go.

00:13:18,595 --> 00:13:22,332
Second one's also to room 810.

00:13:27,971 --> 00:13:30,573
Cody knew the girl he ran over.

00:13:35,945 --> 00:13:40,083
Lucky for us, housekeeping's
a little slow on the uptake.

00:13:51,294 --> 00:13:53,229
Riding glove.

00:13:53,296 --> 00:13:55,632
So he wasn't planning
on re-riding Wintwister

00:13:55,698 --> 00:13:57,100
when he left here.

00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:59,402
Threw back a bunch of beers,

00:13:59,469 --> 00:14:01,271
some liquor.

00:14:01,337 --> 00:14:04,107
I don't see any drugs.

00:14:04,173 --> 00:14:05,108
Bed looks used.

00:14:05,174 --> 00:14:07,543
Maybe he partied with Tiffany.

00:14:09,846 --> 00:14:11,781
Bet it cost him.

00:14:11,848 --> 00:14:12,916
I ran her priors.

00:14:12,982 --> 00:14:14,951
She's got a couple
for solicitation.

00:14:15,018 --> 00:14:17,420
"I can't help now but wonder

00:14:17,487 --> 00:14:20,189
"what your brown eyes
were concealing.

00:14:20,256 --> 00:14:24,027
"They just showed me reflections
of all that I was feeling...

00:14:26,062 --> 00:14:30,967
"Our bodies close together
like my ride hand in my glove.

00:14:31,034 --> 00:14:32,869
"Hearts pounding
with excitement

00:14:32,936 --> 00:14:36,573
And, dare I say it, love."

00:14:38,908 --> 00:14:40,476
Nobody ever wrote me a poem.

00:14:40,543 --> 00:14:41,945
"I know
I'll never own you.

00:14:42,011 --> 00:14:43,947
"It's your nature
to run free,

00:14:44,013 --> 00:14:45,315
"but I pray
the Lord above

00:14:45,381 --> 00:14:48,851
that one day
you'll come back to me."

00:14:48,918 --> 00:14:49,852
(sighs)

00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:51,287
That's sweet.

00:14:51,354 --> 00:14:53,957
"By the time you read this,
I'll be married.

00:14:54,023 --> 00:14:56,359
"He's a great guy.

00:14:56,426 --> 00:14:58,528
"Honest, Cody,
I'll always be thankful

00:14:58,595 --> 00:15:00,296
"for everything
you did for me.

00:15:00,363 --> 00:15:01,297
"Love,

00:15:01,364 --> 00:15:02,565
Tiffany."

00:15:02,632 --> 00:15:04,567
Sounds like it was more
than a money relationship.

00:15:04,634 --> 00:15:07,003
Mm-hmm.

00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:09,205
Broken bones--
he gets up and rides again.

00:15:09,272 --> 00:15:13,443
Broken heart and he's a killer.

00:15:17,847 --> 00:15:20,483
GRISSOM:
"Then we'll ride off in glory
until our time

00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,884
"is done

00:15:21,951 --> 00:15:26,089
And I will be your hero,
your cowboy in the sun."

00:15:26,155 --> 00:15:28,224
It's not
Shakespeare.

00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:29,959
I'm actually a fan
of cowboy poetry.

00:15:30,026 --> 00:15:30,960
Are you really?

00:15:31,027 --> 00:15:31,995
Yeah, it's just a way

00:15:32,061 --> 00:15:34,230
of organizing your thoughts
and feelings

00:15:34,297 --> 00:15:35,865
so that you can make sense
of them.

00:15:35,932 --> 00:15:37,400
Well, it sounds like Cody
was trying to make sense

00:15:37,467 --> 00:15:39,569
out of his girl
leaving him.

00:15:39,636 --> 00:15:42,205
Yeah, well, poetry can help
you with that, too.

00:15:45,408 --> 00:15:49,545
Rib fractures,
multiple lacerations,

00:15:49,612 --> 00:15:51,014
pulmonary contusions,

00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,283
lacerated aorta,
lacerated liver.

00:15:53,349 --> 00:15:55,351
I could go on,
but you get the idea.

00:15:55,418 --> 00:15:58,087
COD was multiple
blunt force trauma.

00:15:58,154 --> 00:16:01,157
Right, but not all of it
was from the hit-and-run.

00:16:02,926 --> 00:16:05,261
You see the coloration
of the bruises?

00:16:05,328 --> 00:16:06,829
Yellowish.

00:16:06,896 --> 00:16:11,668
They're from an event at least
12 hours before the accident.

00:16:11,734 --> 00:16:15,305
Maybe Cody had
rejection issues.

00:16:15,371 --> 00:16:17,473
Could be why
she was leaving him.

00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:23,446
SANDERS:
Lot of tools back here.

00:16:23,513 --> 00:16:25,615
It's an equipment-
intensive sport.

00:16:41,664 --> 00:16:44,934
What have we here?

00:16:45,001 --> 00:16:47,203
Some kind of
cattle prod?

00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,750
They don't use those
in professional bull riding.

00:16:48,817 --> 00:16:51,917
Buckaroos,
have you seen Catherine?

00:16:51,984 --> 00:16:53,986
'Cause I just got the results

00:16:54,053 --> 00:16:56,000
from that semen stain
on Cody Latshaw's jeans.

00:16:56,067 --> 00:16:57,568
Come up with a match?

00:16:57,635 --> 00:17:00,505
I did. I had to run
an Ouchterlony test on it.

00:17:00,571 --> 00:17:02,500
So not from a human donor?

00:17:02,567 --> 00:17:04,269
No... no.

00:17:04,336 --> 00:17:05,604
Bovine.

00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:07,806
Yeah...

00:17:07,872 --> 00:17:10,542
I took a psychobiology class
once and we studied

00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:11,710
a very interesting case.

00:17:11,776 --> 00:17:13,678
Okay, there was a guy,
he lived on a farm,

00:17:13,745 --> 00:17:14,813
and literally the only way

00:17:14,879 --> 00:17:16,047
that this guy could get
sexually satisfied

00:17:16,114 --> 00:17:18,116
was when he was
with livestock.

00:17:18,183 --> 00:17:19,117
That's okay. I'm good.

00:17:19,184 --> 00:17:20,352
Well, see,
apparently,

00:17:20,418 --> 00:17:21,620
the whole thing started
one night

00:17:21,686 --> 00:17:22,988
because he was in the barn--
it started snowing.

00:17:23,054 --> 00:17:24,222
He got stuck in there.

00:17:24,289 --> 00:17:26,024
He couldn't make his way
back to the farmhouse,

00:17:26,091 --> 00:17:29,127
so he decided that
he would try and stay warm...

00:17:29,194 --> 00:17:31,329
well, with a sheep.

00:17:33,198 --> 00:17:35,066
But then the horses
were jealous, so...

00:17:35,133 --> 00:17:37,068
you know, and I
think there was

00:17:37,135 --> 00:17:38,236
a cow in there
as well.

00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,638
You know,
I think we got the picture.

00:17:39,704 --> 00:17:40,905
I wish I didn't.

00:17:43,108 --> 00:17:46,044
(buzzing)

00:17:46,111 --> 00:17:48,113
I think I know what this is for.

00:17:49,814 --> 00:17:52,150
TWICKER:
<i>It's called</i>
<i>an electroejaculator.</i>

00:17:52,217 --> 00:17:54,219
It's used on bulls
that have back trouble.

00:17:54,286 --> 00:17:57,022
It looks, uh...
pretty persuasive.

00:17:57,088 --> 00:17:58,223
Yeah.

00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:00,091
So, uh, was Cody helping you
collect from Wintwister?

00:18:00,158 --> 00:18:01,493
Hell, no.

00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:04,496
First of all, you don't
collect during competition.

00:18:04,562 --> 00:18:06,364
Right, right, so like
an athlete before a game.

00:18:06,431 --> 00:18:07,666
Now you're talking.

00:18:07,732 --> 00:18:10,001
And when I do collect, I bring
a service out to the ranch.

00:18:10,068 --> 00:18:11,603
You know, one collection
from that old boy

00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:12,604
gives you about...

00:18:12,671 --> 00:18:13,705
500 breeding units.

00:18:13,772 --> 00:18:15,941
At a hundred bucks a
pop, you do the math.

00:18:16,007 --> 00:18:17,375
Well, if the stuff
is so valuable,

00:18:17,442 --> 00:18:19,144
maybe Cody was doing a little
moonlighting, you know,

00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:20,779
collecting on his own,
making a little extra money.

00:18:20,845 --> 00:18:22,714
Cattle rustling?
No, not Cody.

00:18:22,781 --> 00:18:24,983
We found bull semen
on his jeans.

00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:26,751
Cody wouldn't
steal from me.

00:18:26,818 --> 00:18:28,086
Besides, it's a
two-person job,

00:18:28,153 --> 00:18:30,121
no matter which
method you use.

00:18:30,188 --> 00:18:31,389
There's more than one?

00:18:31,456 --> 00:18:33,525
In addition
to your electroejaculation,

00:18:33,592 --> 00:18:36,328
you got what's called
an artificial vagina.

00:18:36,394 --> 00:18:38,997
Now, you get a teaser animal
in there, like a steer.

00:18:39,064 --> 00:18:42,000
See, bulls go homosexual
in captivity.

00:18:42,067 --> 00:18:43,902
You get that bull
to mount that steer,

00:18:43,969 --> 00:18:46,304
then you get that AV in there
right before th...
Yeah, I get the point.

00:18:47,872 --> 00:18:49,541
Do you know this girl?

00:18:49,608 --> 00:18:50,875
We think
she's Cody's girlfriend.

00:18:50,942 --> 00:18:53,378
(scoffing):
Yeah.

00:18:53,445 --> 00:18:54,879
I thought he had a new
girlfriend in Vegas

00:18:54,946 --> 00:18:57,148
from the way
his mood was changing.

00:18:57,215 --> 00:19:01,620
She's younger, probably...
does whatever he says.

00:19:01,686 --> 00:19:03,955
Mm-hmm.
Listen,

00:19:04,022 --> 00:19:06,024
if you need anything else,
I'll be at the arena all day.

00:19:06,091 --> 00:19:08,660
I thought Wintwister
didn't compete tonight.

00:19:08,727 --> 00:19:13,398
Well, Captain,
I'm not a one-bull kind of gal.

00:19:16,368 --> 00:19:19,170
Here you are, sir.

00:19:19,237 --> 00:19:20,805
Can I help you?

00:19:20,872 --> 00:19:23,575
Saw a woman get
killed last night.

00:19:23,642 --> 00:19:25,143
BRASS (over phone):
<i>Hey, Cath, listen, it's Jim.</i>

00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:26,378
We got an eyewitness confirming

00:19:26,444 --> 00:19:29,381
that Tiffany's TOD
was after 2:21 A.M.

00:19:29,447 --> 00:19:32,550
Well, that's over an hour
after Cody's body was found.

00:19:32,617 --> 00:19:34,352
Thanks, Jim.

00:19:34,419 --> 00:19:35,820
Hey.
STOKES:
Hey.

00:19:35,887 --> 00:19:38,757
I got prints from the truck,
but half of them are Cody's.

00:19:38,823 --> 00:19:39,791
Well, it is his truck.

00:19:39,858 --> 00:19:41,459
So... get this.

00:19:41,526 --> 00:19:45,563
There's a witness that puts
Tiffany's TOD after Cody's.

00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:46,665
He didn't kill her.

00:19:46,731 --> 00:19:48,600
I think he had a partner.

00:19:48,667 --> 00:19:49,901
There's a set of unknowns

00:19:49,968 --> 00:19:53,838
both on the truck and on the,
uh... electro-love machine.

00:19:53,905 --> 00:19:55,840
So... say
this partner

00:19:55,907 --> 00:19:58,443
thought Tiffany knew something
about the semen-rustling

00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:01,279
and he ran her over
to keep her quiet.

00:20:01,346 --> 00:20:03,515
So who's the partner?

00:20:03,582 --> 00:20:05,016
We've got Cody's phone.

00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:07,385
Find out who he's
been talking to.

00:20:09,354 --> 00:20:13,525
JOHNSON:
Most of Cody's calls were to
a number in Durant, Oklahoma.

00:20:13,592 --> 00:20:15,760
He lived on the
family ranch.

00:20:15,827 --> 00:20:18,029
He was probably letting his
folks know how he was doing

00:20:18,096 --> 00:20:19,831
in the finals.

00:20:19,898 --> 00:20:24,035
All other calls were to
PBR staff and to Tiffany.

00:20:24,102 --> 00:20:26,338
What about
her records?

00:20:26,404 --> 00:20:27,706
Well, they're a little
more interesting.

00:20:27,772 --> 00:20:28,707
Check out...

00:20:28,773 --> 00:20:30,508
last night.

00:20:35,247 --> 00:20:39,751
A dozen calls after midnight
from Eric Hong.

00:20:39,818 --> 00:20:41,553
Precious Ricky.

00:20:43,054 --> 00:20:44,723
You know this guy?

00:20:44,789 --> 00:20:46,925
Yeah,
he's a pimp,

00:20:46,992 --> 00:20:49,628
and he quit calling her
after 2:00 A.M.,

00:20:49,694 --> 00:20:51,696
like he knew she
was already dead.

00:20:55,267 --> 00:20:57,836
(laughs)

00:20:57,902 --> 00:21:00,138
All right,
I don't want nobody hitting me.

00:21:00,205 --> 00:21:01,706
All right?

00:21:01,773 --> 00:21:02,941
Nobody's going
to hit you, Rick.

00:21:03,008 --> 00:21:04,843
Good.

00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:06,778
This is about
Tiffany Rigdon.

00:21:06,845 --> 00:21:07,946
Beautiful girl,

00:21:08,013 --> 00:21:10,682
skin like butterfly wings.

00:21:10,749 --> 00:21:12,617
Did you beat her up?

00:21:12,684 --> 00:21:15,253
I'm a lover, brother.

00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,788
Let me tell you something, man.

00:21:16,855 --> 00:21:18,790
You play around with me, I'm
gonna throw your ass in jail.

00:21:18,857 --> 00:21:19,791
You feel me?

00:21:19,858 --> 00:21:22,127
Yeah, I feel you.

00:21:22,193 --> 00:21:24,229
Good.

00:21:24,296 --> 00:21:26,131
So she said she
was leaving you,

00:21:26,197 --> 00:21:28,199
going to get married, right?

00:21:28,266 --> 00:21:29,567
(grunts)

00:21:29,634 --> 00:21:32,804
Oh, come on, at least
admit I'm right about that.

00:21:32,871 --> 00:21:34,105
Yeah, okay, sure.

00:21:34,172 --> 00:21:35,740
Is that when you took
her boyfriend's truck

00:21:35,807 --> 00:21:37,442
and ran her over?

00:21:37,509 --> 00:21:39,010
Wait. Wait.

00:21:39,077 --> 00:21:40,879
It's a good plan, Rick:
you get the boyfriend

00:21:40,946 --> 00:21:42,213
and a little revenge to boot.

00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,415
I mean, it's...

00:21:43,481 --> 00:21:44,983
Okay, I didn't like
the girl quitting on me,

00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:46,384
especially during one
of my busiest freaking weeks

00:21:46,451 --> 00:21:47,385
of the year,

00:21:47,452 --> 00:21:49,554
and I wanted
to talk her out of it.

00:21:49,621 --> 00:21:50,822
Is that all you did: talk?

00:21:50,889 --> 00:21:52,157
No, I couldn't even talk
to her.

00:21:52,223 --> 00:21:54,459
She wouldn't take my calls,
so I quit trying.

00:21:54,526 --> 00:21:57,128
Where were you making
all these phone calls from?

00:21:57,195 --> 00:21:58,730
From a country-western bar.

00:21:58,797 --> 00:22:00,799
I hit them all
when the cowboys come to town.

00:22:00,865 --> 00:22:02,834
Mm-hmm, all right, all right,
I'll check it out.

00:22:02,901 --> 00:22:05,303
Yeah, you do that, please.

00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:07,739
I didn't take you
for a country music fan.

Dispatch, this is C-21 Brown.

00:29:13,412 --> 00:29:15,013
The pickup
that you're looking for

00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:18,383
is on level 3 of the PD garage.

00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:22,454
Suspect is in the vehicle,
armed and agitated.

00:29:22,521 --> 00:29:25,624
I repeat:
suspect is armed and agitated.

00:29:25,691 --> 00:29:27,393
Copy, C-21.

00:29:27,459 --> 00:29:28,727
Units responding.

00:29:28,794 --> 00:29:30,996
Code Three.

00:29:31,063 --> 00:29:33,065
(breathing shallowly)

00:29:45,878 --> 00:29:47,713
Hey, buddy.

00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:50,482
Hey. You must
be Troy, huh?

00:29:50,549 --> 00:29:52,518
(elevator bell dings)
Just be cool, okay?

00:29:52,584 --> 00:29:54,820
All right?

00:29:54,887 --> 00:29:58,390
BRASS:
Hey, Troy,

00:29:58,457 --> 00:30:00,459
listen to me.

00:30:02,294 --> 00:30:04,229
We don't want anyone
getting hurt, okay?

00:30:04,296 --> 00:30:05,764
So put the
gun down.

00:30:05,831 --> 00:30:08,233
Come out of the truck
with your hands up.

00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,269
Put the gun
down, Troy.

00:30:10,335 --> 00:30:12,271
Just let it
fall away.

00:30:12,337 --> 00:30:14,173
<i>Now.</i>

00:30:14,239 --> 00:30:15,874
He moves

00:30:15,941 --> 00:30:17,576
on that gun,
don't wait.

00:30:17,643 --> 00:30:19,445
Hang on, Jim.

00:30:19,511 --> 00:30:21,814
Let me... Let me
talk to him real quick.

00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,048
Okay,

00:30:23,115 --> 00:30:24,850
but we're not taking
any chances.

00:30:24,917 --> 00:30:26,285
STOKES:
Yeah, yeah, okay.

00:30:26,351 --> 00:30:28,587
Hey, Troy, when's
the last time

00:30:28,654 --> 00:30:30,689
you got down
to Big Bend?

00:30:30,756 --> 00:30:32,191
Huh?

00:30:32,257 --> 00:30:34,960
You-You got the plate frame.

00:30:35,027 --> 00:30:37,429
Man, I used to go to
summer camp down there.

00:30:37,496 --> 00:30:39,598
Stay back!

00:30:39,665 --> 00:30:41,100
Hey, take it
easy, Troy.

00:30:41,166 --> 00:30:44,903
Look, I got no
weapon on me.

00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:48,140
Okay, I just want to talk
to you for a second.

00:30:48,207 --> 00:30:50,876
I killed somebody!

00:30:50,943 --> 00:30:52,678
Yeah, I know.

00:30:52,745 --> 00:30:54,480
You came out to Vegas,

00:30:54,546 --> 00:30:56,415
and you got in over your head,

00:30:56,482 --> 00:30:58,450
but this is getting
out of control.

00:30:58,517 --> 00:31:00,018
If you don't put
that gun down,

00:31:00,085 --> 00:31:01,587
these cops are going
to start shooting,

00:31:01,653 --> 00:31:03,922
and that could turn out
very bad for both of us.

00:31:03,989 --> 00:31:05,758
You know what I mean?
(breathing shallowly)

00:31:05,824 --> 00:31:08,293
I'm just... I'm just doing
the right thing.

00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:12,398
Making sure you know it was me.

00:31:12,464 --> 00:31:14,400
And I'll pay
for what I did.

00:31:14,466 --> 00:31:16,135
Eye for an eye, man.

00:31:16,201 --> 00:31:17,803
Hey.

00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:20,005
Stay back! I'll do it, I swear!

00:31:20,072 --> 00:31:21,240
I'll do it,
I swear!

00:31:21,306 --> 00:31:23,742
No, Troy, just wait.
Hang on now. Listen to me.

00:31:23,809 --> 00:31:25,611
I know about Tiffany.

00:31:25,677 --> 00:31:28,514
I know why she stood you up
at the wedding chapel.

00:31:32,418 --> 00:31:34,420
(voice breaking):
That Ricky.

00:31:37,423 --> 00:31:39,425
Thought he owned her.

00:31:42,928 --> 00:31:43,962
Hey!

00:31:44,029 --> 00:31:45,330
Hey, what you doing, man?

00:31:45,397 --> 00:31:46,165
(gunshot)

00:31:46,231 --> 00:31:48,634
He wouldn't let her come.

00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,302
Hey, man, look at me.

00:31:50,369 --> 00:31:52,404
Look at me.

00:31:52,471 --> 00:31:54,473
(garbled radio transmission)

00:31:55,674 --> 00:31:59,178
I know she wanted
to be there for you.

00:31:59,244 --> 00:32:01,280
Come on out of there, man.

00:32:01,346 --> 00:32:03,315
I'll tell you all about it.

00:32:03,382 --> 00:32:05,984
You don't want
to do this.

00:32:06,051 --> 00:32:08,053
(garbled radio transmission)

00:32:09,521 --> 00:32:11,356
Give me that.

00:32:13,592 --> 00:32:15,527
Come on, give me
that thing.

00:32:15,594 --> 00:32:17,596
Give it to me.

00:32:17,663 --> 00:32:20,032
(inhales and exhales loudly)

00:32:21,867 --> 00:32:23,569
It's going
to be okay.

00:32:23,635 --> 00:32:25,904
(sighs)

00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:30,142
(garbled radio transmission)

00:32:34,913 --> 00:32:37,249
You didn't go
to summer camp.

00:32:37,316 --> 00:32:40,552
Missed you around here.

00:32:40,619 --> 00:32:42,321
Welcome back.

00:32:42,388 --> 00:32:44,189
Thanks.

00:32:44,256 --> 00:32:46,258
(garbled radio transmission)

00:32:50,629 --> 00:32:53,332
Well, we know that Cody
wasn't alone when he died

00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:55,567
because he couldn't have opened
the bucking chute by himself.

00:32:55,634 --> 00:32:57,569
And we know that someone
other than Cody put

00:32:57,636 --> 00:33:01,173
the electroejaculation equipment
into the truck and drove away.

00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,574
Killing Tiffany.

00:33:02,641 --> 00:33:05,711
Whoever that someone was
knew how to get into the arena,

00:33:05,778 --> 00:33:06,583
and also how to use
the equipment.

00:33:08,084 --> 00:33:09,486
More cowbell!

00:33:14,157 --> 00:33:15,325
I processed these
for you.

00:33:15,392 --> 00:33:16,560
And?

00:33:16,626 --> 00:33:18,094
Well, as you can see,
they're bull ropes.

00:33:18,161 --> 00:33:20,530
These are the kind that the
riders hold in their hands.

00:33:20,597 --> 00:33:23,266
Every rider has one, and
they're usually custom-made.

00:33:23,333 --> 00:33:25,602
I mean,
look at that craftsmanship.

00:33:25,669 --> 00:33:27,804
Yeah, it's exquisite.

00:33:27,871 --> 00:33:29,806
Now, that's the rope that I
collected from Cody's room?

00:33:29,873 --> 00:33:31,007
Yes, it is.

00:33:31,074 --> 00:33:33,977
Uh, you'll note
that it is polynylon.

00:33:34,044 --> 00:33:36,713
Now the rope that was collected
from the crime scene,

00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:39,082
though, was long sisal,
a type of hemp.

00:33:39,149 --> 00:33:41,418
Very old-school, and they
stopped making it years ago.

00:33:41,484 --> 00:33:43,620
That means the rope found
with Cody's body

00:33:43,687 --> 00:33:46,156
belonged to someone
who's been around for a while.

00:33:46,222 --> 00:33:50,360
How'd you like to go
on a roundup?

00:33:54,898 --> 00:33:56,600
Hey, Ms. Twicker,
how's it going?

00:33:56,666 --> 00:33:59,903
It'd be going a lot better
if my bull Wintwister

00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:01,504
was in there bucking.

00:34:01,571 --> 00:34:02,706
Is Cash Dooley here?

00:34:02,772 --> 00:34:04,541
Cash!

00:34:05,842 --> 00:34:07,777
Cops want to talk to you.

00:34:07,844 --> 00:34:09,512
(bull lowing)

00:34:11,381 --> 00:34:13,016
BRASS:
Hey, Mr. Dooley.

00:34:13,083 --> 00:34:15,685
So, where you staying
when you're here in Vegas?

00:34:15,752 --> 00:34:16,987
Here.

00:34:17,053 --> 00:34:18,755
He's got the
sleeper cab up front.

00:34:18,822 --> 00:34:20,490
Oh, right here.

00:34:20,557 --> 00:34:22,659
Is that where you
keep your clothes,

00:34:22,726 --> 00:34:24,694
the rest of
your stuff?
What's this about?

00:34:24,761 --> 00:34:26,363
I'd like to take a look
in that cab.

00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:27,697
No. It's private.

00:34:27,764 --> 00:34:29,566
NANCY:
Now hold on.
I own this rig.

00:34:29,633 --> 00:34:31,468
If you guys want
to search it,

00:34:31,534 --> 00:34:33,670
go ahead.

00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,235
BRASS:
<i>Well, bull semen is property,</i>

00:35:05,302 --> 00:35:07,571
<i>and that property isn't yours</i>
<i>so it's theft.</i>

00:35:07,637 --> 00:35:09,573
Now, here's what I think
happened.

00:35:09,639 --> 00:35:10,907
You know Cody.

00:35:10,974 --> 00:35:12,175
He's at the end
of his career.

00:35:12,242 --> 00:35:13,610
He's a little down
on his luck.

00:35:13,677 --> 00:35:15,779
Never put any money aside.

00:35:15,845 --> 00:35:18,148
Wintwister's output goes
for 20 grand a pop

00:35:18,214 --> 00:35:20,183
on the open market.

00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:22,185
So you and Cody,
you get together,

00:35:22,252 --> 00:35:26,189
you do the deed and, uh,
sell it on the sly.

00:35:26,256 --> 00:35:28,525
If you knew Cody,

00:35:28,592 --> 00:35:30,260
you'd know he'd never do
anything like that.

00:35:30,327 --> 00:35:33,597
And then when he told his
girlfriend, you took his truck.

00:35:33,663 --> 00:35:35,832
He always let me
borrow his truck.

00:35:35,899 --> 00:35:38,101
Even when it was
to hunt down his girl?

00:35:38,168 --> 00:35:39,636
Jim?

00:35:45,442 --> 00:35:47,310
We ran his ten-card
against the prints

00:35:47,377 --> 00:35:48,578
from the truck
and the equipment.

00:35:48,645 --> 00:35:50,580
They don't match.
So, there is
a third guy?

00:35:50,647 --> 00:35:52,182
Right. So now,
I'm convinced

00:35:52,249 --> 00:35:54,384
that Cody Latshaw's death
was not an accident.

00:36:02,592 --> 00:36:06,229
Okay, so who is working
with you on this, Cash, huh?

00:36:06,296 --> 00:36:08,665
Who was at the wheel
of Cody's truck

00:36:08,732 --> 00:36:10,000
when you ran down
that girl?

00:36:10,066 --> 00:36:12,068
Was it someone
in the arena?

00:36:15,272 --> 00:36:17,707
What's this,
a cowboy code of silence?

00:36:17,774 --> 00:36:19,042
Look,

00:36:19,109 --> 00:36:20,710
you want to make me
compel fingerprints

00:36:20,777 --> 00:36:22,646
from everyone working
in that arena,

00:36:22,712 --> 00:36:24,714
I can do that.

00:36:24,781 --> 00:36:26,983
(crowd cheering)

00:36:31,955 --> 00:36:33,890
(crowd cheering)

00:36:33,957 --> 00:36:36,226
We got a match!

00:36:36,293 --> 00:36:38,261
Dustin Lightfoot.

00:36:38,328 --> 00:36:40,430
Dustin? He's a bullfighter.

00:36:47,304 --> 00:36:49,406
(announcer shouting)

00:36:49,472 --> 00:36:52,075
I got a 440 exiting the east end

00:36:52,142 --> 00:36:54,311
of the arena.
Head him off.

00:37:07,591 --> 00:37:09,125
Hold it.
Freeze. Right there.

00:37:09,192 --> 00:37:11,194
Don't move.

00:37:12,862 --> 00:37:14,864
Hands behind
your back.

00:37:14,931 --> 00:37:17,601
Well, howdy, partner.

00:37:17,667 --> 00:37:19,469
This is a new experience
for me.

00:37:19,536 --> 00:37:21,972
First time I caught me
a cattle rustler.

00:37:24,007 --> 00:37:26,876
LIGHTFOOT:
<i>Look, Cash and me was just</i>

00:37:26,943 --> 00:37:29,813
<i>trying to make</i>
<i>a little extra money.</i>

00:37:29,879 --> 00:37:32,315
BRASS:
<i>Then Cody Latshaw came in drunk</i>

00:37:32,382 --> 00:37:34,517
<i>and itching for a fight.</i>

00:37:38,588 --> 00:37:40,690
Hey! Quit that!

00:37:40,757 --> 00:37:41,892
Hey, Cody.

00:37:41,958 --> 00:37:43,026
You hear me?

00:37:43,093 --> 00:37:44,461
Cody, relax.
Ain't nobody hurtin'

00:37:44,527 --> 00:37:46,129
anybody.
That ain't your property.

00:37:46,196 --> 00:37:48,064
Cody, Cody, just...

00:37:51,334 --> 00:37:53,703
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

00:37:59,809 --> 00:38:02,579
He ain't breathin'.

00:38:02,646 --> 00:38:04,714
We wasn't tryin'
to kill him.

00:38:04,781 --> 00:38:06,883
He had a cervical
fracture

00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:08,051
from his earlier ride.

00:38:08,118 --> 00:38:09,819
It didn't take much
to snap his spine.

00:38:13,924 --> 00:38:16,459
Then you tried to make it
look like an accident.

00:38:28,672 --> 00:38:31,408
But you didn't have
to run over his girlfriend.

00:38:31,474 --> 00:38:33,410
That girl we hit--
that was...

00:38:33,476 --> 00:38:34,911
that was Cody's girlfriend?

00:38:34,978 --> 00:38:37,581
Yeah, you didn't know?

00:38:37,647 --> 00:38:38,815
We was racing

00:38:38,882 --> 00:38:41,718
to get the product
to our buyer.

00:38:41,785 --> 00:38:44,754
And we took Cody's truck
'cause, well,

00:38:44,821 --> 00:38:48,158
mine ain't air-conditioned and,
and he wasn't gonna be usin' it.

00:38:52,996 --> 00:38:54,197
(tires screeching)

00:38:56,399 --> 00:38:58,835
BRASS:
Well.

00:39:04,374 --> 00:39:06,343
WILLOWS:
<i>It's kind of a lonely life,</i>
<i>these cowboys, </i>

00:39:06,409 --> 00:39:07,844
<i>every weekend a different town.</i>

00:39:07,911 --> 00:39:09,846
That's part of the tradition,
you know.

00:39:09,913 --> 00:39:11,681
Solitary man out there
trying to find himself.

00:39:11,748 --> 00:39:14,684
Yeah, but no man is an island.

00:39:14,751 --> 00:39:17,687
I mean, obviously, he had
feelings for Nancy

00:39:17,754 --> 00:39:19,055
or he wouldn't have
written her that poem.

00:39:19,122 --> 00:39:21,358
Nancy? I don't know about that.
Tiffany's the one

00:39:21,424 --> 00:39:23,426
that broke his heart.
I don't think it's
about either girl.

00:39:25,428 --> 00:39:27,197
"I can't help now but wonder

00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:30,033
what your brown eyes
were concealing."

00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,269
Did you read
Tiffany's autopsy report?

00:39:32,335 --> 00:39:33,603
Oh.

00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:35,138
Yeah, her eyes were blue.

00:39:35,205 --> 00:39:37,274
So were Nancy's.

00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:39,943
Then who did he write
the poem for?

00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:41,645
Wintwister.

00:39:43,179 --> 00:39:44,948
The bull?
I think

00:39:45,015 --> 00:39:46,983
that's why he went back
to the arena that night.

00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:48,785
Wordsworth
once wrote,

00:39:48,852 --> 00:39:52,789
"Through love we feel
we are greater than we know."

00:39:52,856 --> 00:39:56,026
My guess is, riding that bull,

00:39:56,092 --> 00:39:59,095
<i>Cody felt like a greater man.</i>

00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:02,365
<i>"Our bodies close together,</i>

00:40:02,432 --> 00:40:06,136
<i>"like my ride hand</i>
<i>in my glove.</i>

00:40:06,202 --> 00:40:08,305
<i>"Hearts pounding with</i>
<i>excitement, and dare I say it,</i>

00:40:08,371 --> 00:40:10,574
<i>"love.</i>

00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:14,411
"I know I'll never own you;
it's your nature to run free.

00:40:14,477 --> 00:40:16,413
"But I pray the Lord above

00:40:16,479 --> 00:40:18,481
"that one day
you'll come back to me.

00:40:18,548 --> 00:40:23,086
<i>"Then we'll ride off in glory</i>
<i>until our time is done.</i>

00:40:23,153 --> 00:40:26,590
<i>"And I will be your hero,</i>

00:40:26,656 --> 00:40:29,926
<i>your cowboy in the sun.</i>
