MAN:
So you were at
the strip club

00:00:03,941 --> 00:00:05,743
on official business
earlier in the day,

00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:08,346
but then you went back
on your own time later?

00:00:08,412 --> 00:00:10,014
I already told you, yes.

00:00:10,081 --> 00:00:13,251
And that's when
you met the victim?

00:00:13,317 --> 00:00:15,419
Are you guys writing
any of this down?

00:00:15,486 --> 00:00:16,654
I first met Candy

00:00:16,721 --> 00:00:18,956
in the parking lot
of the strip club.

00:00:19,023 --> 00:00:20,458
Later on,

00:00:20,525 --> 00:00:22,960
<i>I talked to her inside.</i>

00:00:24,562 --> 00:00:26,364
Approximately
how much money did you spend

00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,065
getting to know the victim?

00:00:28,132 --> 00:00:31,202
300 bucks, but that was because
it was part of an investigation.

00:00:31,269 --> 00:00:32,370
And that would be

00:00:32,436 --> 00:00:33,671
the investigation

00:00:33,738 --> 00:00:35,406
the Undersheriff told you
to drop?

00:00:35,473 --> 00:00:37,708
Yes...
You still on
the modafinil and the

00:00:37,775 --> 00:00:38,943
zolpidem?

00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:40,811
No, I'm off them.

00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:42,813
Did you take them yesterday?

00:00:45,683 --> 00:00:48,553
So, today is the first day

00:00:48,619 --> 00:00:52,423
of the rest
of your life, hmm?

00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:56,561
(garbled radio transmission)

00:00:56,627 --> 00:00:58,396
SANDERS:
Dispatch said
body at a dump.

00:00:58,462 --> 00:01:00,831

Yeah, this is definitely
not the city dump.

Nick? Greg?

00:01:29,493 --> 00:01:31,028
Kids were out here
drinking beer,

00:01:31,095 --> 00:01:32,496
found the dead dogs.

00:01:32,563 --> 00:01:33,698
Patrol unit came,

00:01:33,764 --> 00:01:36,067
responded and found
the female DB.

00:01:36,133 --> 00:01:39,103
Looks like animal bites
on her arms and legs.

00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:41,372
SANDERS:
Yup. Coyotes must
have gotten to her.

00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,375
(beep, camera shutter clicking)

00:01:44,442 --> 00:01:47,178
No purse or ID on her.

00:01:47,245 --> 00:01:49,347
Okay, Dave, let's see
what we got.

00:01:49,413 --> 00:01:52,483
(garbled radio transmission)

00:01:55,453 --> 00:01:57,522
Whatever bit her must have been
at it for a while.

00:01:57,588 --> 00:01:59,190
STOKES:
Yeah, maybe.

00:01:59,257 --> 00:02:02,126
But I doubt they tied her up
and beat her.

00:02:02,193 --> 00:02:04,061
Check out the contusions,

00:02:04,128 --> 00:02:07,865
ligature marks.

00:02:07,932 --> 00:02:11,102
Disposing of animals
like this is illegal.

00:02:11,168 --> 00:02:13,971
Whoever dumped the vic
must have known about the site

00:02:14,038 --> 00:02:15,973
from dumping dogs.

00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,775
Yup.

00:02:17,842 --> 00:02:21,913

There's some
white trace on the

You were at the scene.

00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,955

any white material

transferred?

Maybe.

00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:46,092
I can't say for sure.

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,595
I mean, there were dead dogs
and trash all over the place.

00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:49,896
Hmm.

00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:51,331
Excuse me.

00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:52,665
Sorry.

00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:56,569
Would you help me
remove her dress?

00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:57,904
Sure.

00:03:57,971 --> 00:03:59,272
Let's just roll her.

00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:08,782
WILLOWS:
That look like
a needle mark?

00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:11,885
I'll send samples to Tox.

MAN:
So, in the course
of developing this informant,

00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,827
you took her to a motel
and had sex with her?

00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:23,696
That part was personal.

00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,698
CSI Brown, in your mind,

00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:29,436
is there any distinction
between personal

00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:30,737
and official?

00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:32,839
Have you guys bothered
to call the motel?

00:04:32,906 --> 00:04:34,674
I checked in with a credit card.

00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:36,976
I checked out around 5:00.

00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:38,311
I called a cab.

00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:39,746
Talk to the cab driver.

00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:41,748
When I woke up,

00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:43,149
Candy was gone.

00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:46,619
When I got back to the club
to pick up my car, she was dead.

00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:50,593
No!

00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,261
Listen to me.

00:04:52,328 --> 00:04:55,431
I did not kill her.

00:04:55,498 --> 00:04:57,934
But I know damn well who did.

00:05:03,339 --> 00:05:05,475
Lou Gedda
to see you, Captain.

00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:07,577
Lou? All right.

00:05:14,917 --> 00:05:16,319
(clears throat)
What's this?

00:05:16,386 --> 00:05:18,488
Candy's mother's
phone number.

00:05:18,554 --> 00:05:20,023
Her parents have already
been notified.

00:05:20,089 --> 00:05:22,091
Candy wrote it down
for me last night

00:05:22,158 --> 00:05:23,793
just before she died.

00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,929
That's why she came back
to the club after her shift.

00:05:26,996 --> 00:05:28,264
Hmm.

00:05:28,331 --> 00:05:30,099
Her mother was
pressuring her to quit.

00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:32,702
Candy wanted me to call
her, give her the talk.

00:05:32,769 --> 00:05:35,271
It's exotic dancing,
not stripping.

00:05:35,338 --> 00:05:37,040
Show business.

00:05:37,106 --> 00:05:38,841
Did you make the call?

00:05:38,908 --> 00:05:42,111
I don't get involved
in family business,

00:05:42,178 --> 00:05:44,213
but I thought it might help
your investigation.

00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,716
How's this going to help me?

00:05:46,783 --> 00:05:47,817
How should I know?

00:05:47,884 --> 00:05:50,586
I'm just trying
to be a good citizen.

00:05:54,691 --> 00:05:56,492
Hey, Doc.
Hey.

00:05:56,559 --> 00:05:58,361
I heard your band
killed last night.

00:05:58,428 --> 00:06:00,229
Really? Who'd you hear
that from?

00:06:00,296 --> 00:06:01,464
My wife's
second cousin.

00:06:01,531 --> 00:06:02,966
Works in the mayor's office

00:06:03,032 --> 00:06:04,634

director.

00:06:04,701 --> 00:06:06,736

Her name's

00:10:10,984 --> 00:10:12,118
He was off the clock.

00:10:12,185 --> 00:10:13,667
Conducting his own
police investigation.

00:10:13,734 --> 00:10:15,535
He's very passionate
about this case.

00:10:15,602 --> 00:10:17,204
Yeah, passionate enough
to sleep with the vic

00:10:17,271 --> 00:10:18,792
who ended up dead in his car.

00:10:18,859 --> 00:10:21,161
Look, I know Warrick didn't have
anything to do with it,

00:10:21,228 --> 00:10:24,331
but he needs to back off.

00:10:26,299 --> 00:10:28,235
Guys like Lou Gedda--

00:10:28,301 --> 00:10:31,872
they don't skip on murder
and extortion by being lucky.

00:10:33,907 --> 00:10:36,610
What does that mean?

00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:38,645
You think Gedda's
got "friends"

00:10:38,712 --> 00:10:40,814
inside the
department?

00:10:40,881 --> 00:10:44,284
Well, unlike Warrick,
I don't make accusations

00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,687
until I have proof.

00:10:58,432 --> 00:11:01,034
Hey, Grissom.

00:11:01,101 --> 00:11:03,070
Did you talk to IA yet?
Yeah.

00:11:03,136 --> 00:11:05,072
They cleared me.

00:11:05,138 --> 00:11:07,240
They didn't seem to have
much interest in Gedda.

00:11:07,307 --> 00:11:08,709
That's because
it wasn't about Gedda.

00:11:08,775 --> 00:11:10,377
It was about you.
It's everything
to do with Gedda.

00:11:10,444 --> 00:11:12,045
Sending me a message.

00:11:12,112 --> 00:11:13,647
Murders an innocent
young girl

00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:15,415
because I got
too close to them.

00:11:15,482 --> 00:11:17,084
I want this case, Gris.

00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:19,953
I hope you know
that's not gonna happen.

00:11:20,278 --> 00:11:22,414
You're in the rotation
as of tomorrow, so go home.

00:11:32,417 --> 00:11:33,852
The white flaky trace

00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:35,353
on your victim's feet
was permethrin,

00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,621
an insect repellent,

00:11:36,688 --> 00:11:38,557
also used
in flea dips.
Mmm.

00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:41,059
She was found
with a bunch of dead dogs.

00:11:41,126 --> 00:11:43,228
What about
the husband's tux?

00:11:43,295 --> 00:11:45,564
No flea dip, no dog
hairs, no blood.

00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:47,566
Just a little bit
of champagne

00:11:47,632 --> 00:11:49,401
and some underarm
deodorant.

00:11:49,468 --> 00:11:51,470
You just exonerated
our only suspect.

00:11:57,609 --> 00:12:00,545
So how crazy
was last night?

00:12:00,612 --> 00:12:02,380
(beeping)
You. Me. Dinner?

00:12:02,447 --> 00:12:03,448
Mm-hmm.

00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:04,875
I thought the Syrah
was quite nice.

00:12:04,941 --> 00:12:08,011
Yes, and thank you
for offering to split the check.

00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:10,180
My date really appreciated it.

00:12:10,247 --> 00:12:12,349
Oh, no problem.

00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,450
Let it be known,

00:12:13,517 --> 00:12:15,519
that I am nothing
if not a gentleman.

00:12:18,021 --> 00:12:19,956
Why were you at a restaurant
like Nob Hill

00:12:20,023 --> 00:12:21,458
by yourself anyway?

00:12:21,525 --> 00:12:22,959
The Golden Rule.

00:12:23,026 --> 00:12:24,227
Always treat yourself the way

00:12:24,294 --> 00:12:25,662
you would like others
to treat you.

00:12:25,729 --> 00:12:27,697
That's not exactly the rule.

00:12:27,764 --> 00:12:29,699
What are you working on?

00:12:29,766 --> 00:12:32,168
The Elizabeth Rodriguez
homicide.

00:12:32,235 --> 00:12:34,337
She had bite marks on her
with saliva in them,

00:12:34,404 --> 00:12:36,172
and the saliva turned out
to be canine,

00:12:36,239 --> 00:12:38,842
and anytime a dog is impounded
in a criminal case,

00:12:38,909 --> 00:12:41,211
its DNA is collected
and profiled.

00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:43,446
It's just like CODIS.

00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:45,782
DODIS.

00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:47,784
Anyway most of the cases

00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:49,286
in the database
are gang-related.

00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:50,954
But I figured, well,
it's worth a shot.

00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:54,357
Well, that'll look good
on the old Grissom point meter.

00:12:56,393 --> 00:12:58,361
It's protocol.

00:12:58,428 --> 00:13:00,697
I'm just saying,

00:13:00,764 --> 00:13:03,767
be careful: no one
likes a kiss-ass.

00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,872
Really?

00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:38,668

seen Catherine?

00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,308
Yeah, she got
another call-out.

00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:46,743
We're a little bit
shorthanded right now.

00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:47,944
What's up?

00:13:48,011 --> 00:13:49,946
The canine DNA database
got a hit on the saliva.

00:13:50,013 --> 00:13:52,015
It's a pit bull
named Hannibal.

00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:55,085
Confiscated during a drug raid

00:13:55,151 --> 00:13:56,520

government employees aren't

00:20:40,008 --> 00:20:42,511
Must get pretty tough
working here, huh?

00:20:42,578 --> 00:20:44,513
Yeah, you try
to make a difference.

00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,986
I spent some time in a cage,
so I know what it's like.

00:20:50,053 --> 00:20:51,755
(dog panting)

00:20:51,821 --> 00:20:53,356
Yeah, you're
a good boy.

00:20:53,423 --> 00:20:54,208
You're a good boy.

00:20:54,274 --> 00:20:55,676
It's okay, boy.

00:20:55,743 --> 00:20:57,311
It's okay.

00:20:57,377 --> 00:21:00,114
Oh, yeah.

00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,822
(computer chirping)

00:21:14,561 --> 00:21:16,663
You got any print results
from off my car?

00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:18,165
Should I be talking to you?

00:21:18,232 --> 00:21:20,501
Yeah, I've been cleared.

00:21:20,567 --> 00:21:23,370
Well, no, actually all I got
so far are your prints.

00:21:23,437 --> 00:21:25,939
(sighs)

00:21:27,307 --> 00:21:28,976
Wait, I got something.

00:21:35,482 --> 00:21:37,284
I know that guy.

00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:51,265
His name is Richard Dorsey.

00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,568
You know, you keep
pursuing this,

00:21:54,635 --> 00:21:55,969
you're going
to end up suspended.

00:21:56,036 --> 00:21:57,171
Dorsey's prints were found

00:21:57,237 --> 00:21:59,273
inside my car
under the broken window.

00:21:59,339 --> 00:22:02,543
Well, that's consistent with him
putting the body in your car.

00:22:02,609 --> 00:22:03,744
Grissom, he's a homeless guy.

00:22:03,811 --> 00:22:05,979
He lives in the alley
behind the strip club.

00:22:06,046 --> 00:22:07,648
Don't you get it?
He's Gedda's fall guy.

00:22:07,714 --> 00:22:09,717
This is a frame job.

00:22:11,051 --> 00:22:14,421
Okay, I'll have Brass
check it out.

00:22:14,488 --> 00:22:15,756
You stay out of it, though.

00:22:20,561 --> 00:22:22,129
WILLOWS:
<i>We've got the victim's</i>
<i>blood and hair</i>

00:22:22,196 --> 00:22:23,297
at your kennel.

00:22:23,363 --> 00:22:25,365
She died of an overdose
of the same drugs

00:22:25,432 --> 00:22:28,335
that were found
in a medicine cabinet
that only you had access to.

00:22:28,402 --> 00:22:31,705
If I were you, I'd save my money
and start talking.

00:22:31,772 --> 00:22:34,141
Are you acting
as his lawyer now?

00:22:36,917 --> 00:22:39,375
Mr. Card, I found
this hidden camera

00:22:39,442 --> 00:22:40,583
in the exam room.

00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:41,583
Where's the receiver?

00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:43,718
I don't know anything
about this.

00:22:43,785 --> 00:22:45,987
Did you forget about the camera
when you killed
Elizabeth Rodriguez?

00:22:46,054 --> 00:22:48,023
I didn't kill Lizzie.
She was my business partner.

00:22:48,089 --> 00:22:49,257
I'm advising you
to stop talking.

00:22:49,324 --> 00:22:51,426
It's not your ass.

00:22:51,493 --> 00:22:52,694
I'm a victim here.

00:22:52,761 --> 00:22:54,963
How do you figure?

00:22:56,431 --> 00:22:59,201
It was on the morning news
that Lizzie was dead.

00:22:59,267 --> 00:23:01,736
And when I came into work...

00:23:01,803 --> 00:23:03,472
(barking)

00:23:11,346 --> 00:23:15,083
So instead of calling
the police,

00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:18,053
you cleaned up
the crime scene.

00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,621
VEGA:
That makes you
an accessory.

00:23:19,688 --> 00:23:20,889
He was afraid for his life.

00:23:20,956 --> 00:23:22,491
Nobody cheats
the D Street Killers

00:23:22,557 --> 00:23:24,626
out of 50 Gs and lives.

00:23:24,693 --> 00:23:26,795
You cheated them out of $50,000?

00:23:26,862 --> 00:23:28,196
Not me.

00:23:28,263 --> 00:23:30,198
Lizzie.

00:23:30,265 --> 00:23:32,367
We banked 50 Gs.

00:23:32,434 --> 00:23:34,236
I bet Gino's getting
sick of losing.

00:23:34,302 --> 00:23:35,837
It never fails.

00:23:37,639 --> 00:23:40,475
When I fight a dog,
I fight to win.

00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:45,580
Lizzie was the #1 dog fighter
in all of Vegas.

00:23:45,647 --> 00:23:47,449
That drove Gino nuts

00:23:47,516 --> 00:23:48,984
'cause he was like this close

00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:50,752
to knocking her
off the top spot.

00:23:50,819 --> 00:23:53,822
You seriously want us to believe
that Mrs. Rodriguez,

00:23:53,889 --> 00:23:56,057
humanitarian of the year,
was into dog fighting?

00:23:56,124 --> 00:23:57,926
Oh, she was no Mother Theresa.

00:23:57,993 --> 00:24:00,095
But, see, she'd
still be alive

00:24:00,162 --> 00:24:02,864
if she wasn't
a dirty dog fighter.

00:24:02,931 --> 00:24:06,501
That rub, it made
the other dog sick.

00:24:06,568 --> 00:24:09,070
Gee, I hate to see the sport
tainted like that.

00:24:09,137 --> 00:24:11,606
Why do you think she gave money
to my rescue kennel?

00:24:11,673 --> 00:24:14,042
She didn't even like dogs,
but fighting them,

00:24:14,109 --> 00:24:15,277
that was in her blood.

00:24:15,343 --> 00:24:16,451
Passed down from her daddy

00:24:16,518 --> 00:24:19,154
who taught her
the whole family business.

00:24:20,489 --> 00:24:23,392
Okay... what is this?

00:24:27,429 --> 00:24:30,098
It's a... it's a breeding stand.

00:24:31,633 --> 00:24:33,068
The sport has a high

00:24:33,135 --> 00:24:34,603
mortality rate,

00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:38,440
and, uh, combative bitches
won't breed without a fight.

00:24:38,507 --> 00:24:42,411
So we have to tie them down
to consummate the act.

00:24:42,477 --> 00:24:46,014
The victim was tied
to that stand.

00:24:48,625 --> 00:24:50,393
That's sick.

00:24:53,697 --> 00:24:55,265
My client's willing
to give you everything.

00:24:55,332 --> 00:24:56,833
What's "everything"?

00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,636
My client cleaned up the scene,

00:24:59,703 --> 00:25:02,372
but he didn't dispose
of the evidence.

00:25:03,773 --> 00:25:05,508
We can also

00:25:05,575 --> 00:25:07,510
give you Gino Aquino.

00:25:13,116 --> 00:25:15,118

Hey, what's going to happen

00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:13,298
They'll have to be put down.

00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:15,233
Law says they're dangerous.

00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,868
And the people who
turn them into killers,

00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:18,804
they just get away with
a slap on the wrist, huh?

00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,235
It's not illegal
to train them to fight.

00:27:24,872 --> 00:27:26,874
Well, it should be.

00:27:37,385 --> 00:27:38,920
Get away from my house.

00:27:38,986 --> 00:27:41,622
Sorry.

00:27:43,191 --> 00:27:45,960
Grissom.

00:27:46,027 --> 00:27:47,428
All these guys know Dorsey.

00:27:47,495 --> 00:27:48,930

That's him.

00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,089
Richard Dorsey,
time to wake up.

00:28:15,156 --> 00:28:16,391
You're under arrest.
(groans)

00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,502
Meth head.

00:28:28,503 --> 00:28:29,604
No weapons.

00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:30,738
He's clean.

00:28:45,853 --> 00:28:49,290
Pulled this bullet
out of Mr. Aquino's shoulder.

00:28:49,357 --> 00:28:51,259
It looks like
a like .25 caliber.

00:28:51,325 --> 00:28:52,794
That's friendly fire.

00:28:54,629 --> 00:28:56,664
Thanks, Doc.

00:28:58,466 --> 00:28:59,767
GINO AQUINO:
<i>My arm</i>

00:28:59,834 --> 00:29:01,135
ain't never gonna work
right again.

00:29:01,202 --> 00:29:03,137
I'm gonna sure all your asses.
No, no, no, it was

00:29:03,204 --> 00:29:04,706
a .25 caliber slug
they pulled out of you.

00:29:04,772 --> 00:29:05,973
It means it was
one of your boys.

00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,275
It was probably some cop's

00:29:07,341 --> 00:29:08,443
backup.

00:29:08,509 --> 00:29:10,078
Yeah, that's probably it.

00:29:10,144 --> 00:29:11,913
<i>Ya basta,</i> Gino.

00:29:11,979 --> 00:29:14,148
We have a witness who says
you killed Elizabeth Rodriguez

00:29:14,215 --> 00:29:15,983
because she cheated you
out of 50 Gs.

00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:18,786
Let me guess:
you been talking to Steve Card.

00:29:18,853 --> 00:29:20,722
Little screamer.

00:29:20,788 --> 00:29:22,657
That finger's pointing
the other way.

00:29:24,592 --> 00:29:25,660
Lizzie had <i>cojones.</i>

00:29:25,727 --> 00:29:27,795
I loved that woman.
I respected her.

00:29:27,862 --> 00:29:30,331
You never cross Lizzie,
she'll cut 'em off.

00:29:30,398 --> 00:29:33,668
But Card, he thought
he had that immunity idol

00:29:33,735 --> 00:29:34,969
'cause he worked for her.

00:29:35,036 --> 00:29:36,871
<i>Tonto.</i>

00:29:41,008 --> 00:29:42,443
(groans)
You cheating little bitch.

00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:43,911
You been doing this all night?

00:29:44,545 --> 00:29:46,180
(groans)
If I ever

00:29:46,247 --> 00:29:48,049
catch you cheating again,

00:29:48,116 --> 00:29:50,218
I will feed your heart
to that dog.

00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:53,187
That last fight
wasn't on the up.

00:29:53,254 --> 00:29:55,556
Next dog's not right either.
You forfeit.

00:29:56,524 --> 00:29:59,293
Without her, he was nobody.

00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,195
She was a bad bitch.

00:30:01,262 --> 00:30:03,531
That's your motive.

00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,034
Anything else
you need help with?

00:30:08,136 --> 00:30:12,006
Tell me about all the dead dogs
I found down the Silverado Wash.

00:30:12,073 --> 00:30:14,675
Were you the one
that tortured them?

00:30:14,742 --> 00:30:17,011
Made them fight?

00:30:17,078 --> 00:30:18,479
When they died, were you the one

00:30:18,546 --> 00:30:21,049
that threw them out
with the trash? Hmm?

00:30:21,115 --> 00:30:22,483
Was that you?

00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:24,986
I thought this was about Lizzie.

00:30:25,053 --> 00:30:26,988
VEGA:
One way
or another, Gino,

00:30:27,055 --> 00:30:28,956
you're not going to see
the streets for quite a while.

00:30:33,227 --> 00:30:34,595
You know,

00:30:34,662 --> 00:30:36,330
there are two things
a jury can't stand:

00:30:36,397 --> 00:30:38,566
people who abuse kids
and people who abuse animals.

00:30:38,633 --> 00:30:40,601
So <i>buena suerte.</i>

00:30:43,504 --> 00:30:45,673
Classic he said/he said.

00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:48,409
Steve card was the only one
with access to the drugs

00:30:48,476 --> 00:30:50,445
and he admitted to cleaning
up the crime scene.

00:30:50,511 --> 00:30:51,913
There's no forced
entry at the kennel.

00:30:51,979 --> 00:30:53,614
He has no alibi.

00:30:53,681 --> 00:30:56,284
And why would he give us all
of Elizabeth's personal effects?

00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:57,785
You know, I'm starting
to get the feeling

00:30:57,852 --> 00:30:59,687
the guy's not really
all that smart.

00:30:59,754 --> 00:31:01,389
He has a good lawyer.

00:31:01,456 --> 00:31:03,224
Realized that we were
onto his client

00:31:03,291 --> 00:31:04,859
and wanted to throw us
off the scent.

00:31:04,926 --> 00:31:07,328
Well, maybe Gino's
telling the truth.

00:31:07,395 --> 00:31:09,997
Problem is, we don't
have enough evidence

00:31:10,064 --> 00:31:11,466
to convict either one of them.

00:31:12,633 --> 00:31:17,105
One pair of woman's shoes,
size 7, silver.

00:31:17,171 --> 00:31:20,441
Swabbed a blood sample from
the instep of the right shoe,

00:31:20,508 --> 00:31:22,877
sent it to DNA.

00:31:22,944 --> 00:31:25,146
One woman's handbag,
also silver.

00:31:25,213 --> 00:31:26,914
Contents include

00:31:26,981 --> 00:31:31,319
one tube
of Superla Red lipstick #36...

00:31:33,154 --> 00:31:36,090
one mirrored compact...

00:31:36,157 --> 00:31:38,026
(closes compact)

00:31:38,092 --> 00:31:40,495
...one set of keys holding

00:31:40,561 --> 00:31:42,330
four-- no, five keys--

00:31:42,397 --> 00:31:44,332
one Mercedes key,

00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:47,935
one Schlage brass key.

00:32:17,665 --> 00:32:20,001
Steve Card was lying when
he said he was the only one

00:32:20,068 --> 00:32:21,469
with the key to
the drug cabinet.

00:32:21,536 --> 00:32:22,904
Elizabeth
had one, too.

00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:24,806
Means the killer
could have used her key.

00:32:24,872 --> 00:32:27,742
Got a print.

00:32:30,611 --> 00:32:32,146
MAN:
Nick.

00:32:32,213 --> 00:32:33,381
Hey.

00:32:33,448 --> 00:32:34,782
We, uh, we can't really talk
to him yet.

00:32:34,849 --> 00:32:35,983
He's still waiting
for his lawyer.

00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:37,785
He's waiting for me.

00:32:37,852 --> 00:32:40,822
Hmm?
He's a confidential
informant.

00:32:40,888 --> 00:32:43,024
The DA's investigating
Steve Card,

00:32:43,091 --> 00:32:44,826
Gino Aquino,
Elizabeth Rodriguez,

00:32:44,892 --> 00:32:47,128
everybody associated
with the dogfighting ring.

00:32:47,195 --> 00:32:48,529
So you knew about this?

00:32:48,596 --> 00:32:51,899
Knowing about it and proving it
are two different things.

00:32:51,966 --> 00:32:53,935
Okay.

00:32:54,001 --> 00:32:55,036
(scoffs)

00:32:55,103 --> 00:32:56,871
Okay, so what's
this guy's story?

00:32:56,938 --> 00:32:59,640
Same old-- he... used to ride
with the D-Streeters,

00:32:59,707 --> 00:33:01,409
shot his old man
when he was 15,

00:33:01,476 --> 00:33:03,177
did four years
in juvie, got out,

00:33:03,244 --> 00:33:04,412
tried to turn
his life around.

00:33:04,479 --> 00:33:06,314
We busted him 18 months ago
for possession

00:33:06,381 --> 00:33:07,315
and assault.

00:33:07,382 --> 00:33:08,416
He cut a deal.

00:33:08,483 --> 00:33:11,219
So he's got a history
of violence.

00:33:11,285 --> 00:33:13,354
You think he killed
Mrs. Rodriguez?

00:33:13,421 --> 00:33:15,857
It took me over a year

00:33:15,923 --> 00:33:18,159
to get him inside
that dogfighting ring.

00:33:18,226 --> 00:33:19,694
I'm reserving judgment.

00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:24,932
I did the best

00:33:24,999 --> 00:33:26,534
that I could.
I'm sure you did,

00:33:26,601 --> 00:33:28,369
Tommy.
And I told you
what they were doing

00:33:28,436 --> 00:33:30,872
to those dogs
and I gave you all the tapes.

00:33:30,938 --> 00:33:32,340
It wasn't enough.

00:33:32,407 --> 00:33:35,176
We needed to see the dogs
fighting; that's the felony.

00:33:35,243 --> 00:33:37,545
But they had the fights
in different places.

00:33:37,612 --> 00:33:40,748
I mean, she never told me
where they were, s-so...

00:33:40,815 --> 00:33:42,950
Tommy, did you kill
Elizabeth Rodriguez?

00:33:44,986 --> 00:33:48,589
I, I could understand
if you did.

00:33:48,656 --> 00:33:51,125
A whole lot of people that
would say she had it coming.

00:33:52,827 --> 00:33:54,162
(whimpering)

00:33:57,632 --> 00:34:02,103
You know, I've been
on the streets... in juvie.

00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:05,273
I've seen people do
some bad things to each other,

00:34:05,339 --> 00:34:08,309
but those dogs, like...

00:34:08,376 --> 00:34:10,845
you can beat their brains in
and, like, a minute later

00:34:10,912 --> 00:34:12,714
they come up to you
just wagging their tails.

00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:17,018
I know, man.
That's how they are.

00:34:17,085 --> 00:34:18,820
I always had dogs
growing up.

00:34:18,886 --> 00:34:21,522
Did you?

00:34:21,589 --> 00:34:22,757
No, I never had a pet.

00:34:22,824 --> 00:34:24,158
My mom was allergic.

00:34:24,225 --> 00:34:27,095
No, but you really cared
about those dogs at the kennel.

00:34:27,161 --> 00:34:29,497
Now, I know.

00:34:29,564 --> 00:34:31,132
I saw the way
you treated them.

00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,835
Do you know
how they train them?

00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:38,439
<i>They'd run them</i>
<i>till they dropped.</i>

00:34:38,506 --> 00:34:41,409
<i>They'd strengthen their jaws.</i>

00:34:41,476 --> 00:34:46,114
<i>Then, they would feed them</i>
<i>little dogs, sometimes cats...</i>

00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:47,648
(dogs growling, barking,
and whimpering)

00:34:47,715 --> 00:34:50,151
<i>...just to give them</i>
<i>the taste of blood.</i>

00:34:50,218 --> 00:34:51,719
And I showed you
what she did

00:34:51,786 --> 00:34:54,822
and you did nothing
to stop her.

00:34:54,889 --> 00:34:56,691
No.

00:34:56,758 --> 00:34:58,526
No, but you did.

00:35:00,428 --> 00:35:01,963
Didn't you?

00:35:06,901 --> 00:35:09,437
She was fighting dogs.
All right, she was...

00:35:09,504 --> 00:35:13,541
she was killing dogs
in the ring for money

00:35:13,608 --> 00:35:15,543
week after week.

00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:18,746
And the city decides
to give her an award?

00:35:21,416 --> 00:35:24,485
I gave her
what she really deserved.

00:35:25,186 --> 00:35:26,554
(barking in distance)

00:35:38,866 --> 00:35:42,203
(dog squealing)

00:35:49,977 --> 00:35:51,713
(snarling)

00:36:02,056 --> 00:36:03,424
(growling)

00:36:03,491 --> 00:36:07,328
At least I had the decency
to euthanize her

00:36:07,395 --> 00:36:09,630
before I threw her to the dogs.

00:36:18,005 --> 00:36:20,308
Well, you don't look like a guy
who just got a confession.

00:36:20,375 --> 00:36:23,511
Oh... something's
still bugging me.

00:36:23,578 --> 00:36:25,580
If Mr. Rodriguez
hadn't left the party,

00:36:25,646 --> 00:36:27,682
Elizabeth might
still be alive.

00:36:27,749 --> 00:36:30,218
You think he would have gone
to the kennel with her?

00:36:30,284 --> 00:36:32,086
I don't know, but he
received a phone call

00:36:32,153 --> 00:36:35,089
from somebody that night
that made him leave his wife.

00:36:35,156 --> 00:36:36,924
Check the phone records.

00:36:37,992 --> 00:36:39,494
(car lock chirping)

00:36:41,362 --> 00:36:43,297
Mr. Rodriguez.

00:36:43,364 --> 00:36:44,298
<i>Â¿Tienes tiempo?</i>

00:36:44,365 --> 00:36:45,400
Detective Vega, Mr. Stokes.

00:36:46,434 --> 00:36:48,870
Did you catch the man
who killed my wife?

00:36:48,936 --> 00:36:49,904
Yes, sir.

00:36:49,971 --> 00:36:50,938
Tommy Halpert.

00:36:51,005 --> 00:36:52,573
We have him
in custody now.

00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,808
Hey, witnesses
at the party said

00:36:53,875 --> 00:36:56,611
that you received a phone call
the night of the murder

00:36:56,677 --> 00:36:58,546
and then you just left.

00:36:58,613 --> 00:37:01,682
We know that phone call
was from Tommy Halpert.

00:37:07,388 --> 00:37:09,257
What'd you two talk about?

00:37:10,591 --> 00:37:13,294
Tommy said if I didn't speak
to my wife that night,

00:37:13,361 --> 00:37:14,295
he would.

00:37:14,362 --> 00:37:16,431
Speak to your wife about what?

00:37:16,497 --> 00:37:19,500
The dogfighting.

00:37:19,567 --> 00:37:21,703
He showed me the tapes.

00:37:22,737 --> 00:37:25,173
(dog whimpering on tape)

00:37:27,642 --> 00:37:30,144
What did Elizabeth say
when you confronted her?

00:37:30,211 --> 00:37:31,746
I didn't.

00:37:31,813 --> 00:37:33,181
So you just
left her there,

00:37:33,247 --> 00:37:35,616
knowing that Tommy was going
to come after her?

00:37:35,683 --> 00:37:40,188
Violence begets violence.

00:37:40,254 --> 00:37:41,556
Is that all?

00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:45,226
You let this happen.

00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:48,363
You did.

00:37:54,535 --> 00:37:56,270
Hey, you still with me, Richard?

00:37:56,337 --> 00:37:57,538
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:37:57,605 --> 00:37:58,806
Remember her?

00:37:58,873 --> 00:38:00,608
She worked
at Pigalle.

00:38:00,675 --> 00:38:02,243
They all look
the same to me.

00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:03,378
No, they don't.

00:38:03,444 --> 00:38:05,980
There's blondes, brunettes,
B-cups, D-cups.

00:38:06,047 --> 00:38:07,715
How about a cup of coffee, huh?

00:38:07,782 --> 00:38:09,784
Hey, you got a cigarette
I could bum off you?

00:38:09,851 --> 00:38:10,885
It's bad
for your health.

00:38:10,952 --> 00:38:12,320
How about
a diet soda?

00:38:12,387 --> 00:38:13,788
Diet? No. No diet.

00:38:13,855 --> 00:38:15,456
I need the ups.

00:38:15,523 --> 00:38:17,492
Where did you get this?

00:38:20,595 --> 00:38:22,230
Where's the soda?

00:38:22,296 --> 00:38:24,032
Hey, it's a two-way street,
Richard.

00:38:24,098 --> 00:38:25,967
You answer the questions,
we'll get you a soda.

00:38:26,034 --> 00:38:28,002
Yeah.

00:38:28,069 --> 00:38:29,070
Uh...

00:38:29,137 --> 00:38:31,572
I found it.
That's it. I found it.

00:38:31,639 --> 00:38:33,207
No, you didn't.

00:38:33,274 --> 00:38:34,642
I didn't?

00:38:34,709 --> 00:38:36,344
Damn.

00:38:36,411 --> 00:38:38,579
Okay.

00:38:38,646 --> 00:38:39,680
Uh, yeah,
I stole it.

00:38:39,747 --> 00:38:42,517
That's right. I stole it.

00:38:42,583 --> 00:38:45,353
(panting)
Hey!

00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,722
Give me my purse!
Give me my purse!

00:38:47,789 --> 00:38:51,025
(grunting)

00:38:53,594 --> 00:38:54,729
Help!

00:38:54,796 --> 00:38:55,897
Somebody!

00:38:55,963 --> 00:38:57,832
I needed money.

00:38:57,899 --> 00:38:59,133
BRASS:
Then what happened?

00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,501
I got high.

00:39:00,568 --> 00:39:01,602
Then what?
I got high again.

00:39:01,669 --> 00:39:03,071
Then what?

00:39:03,137 --> 00:39:04,405
Did you kill her?

00:39:06,107 --> 00:39:08,076
We found her purse and
the bloody murder weapon

00:39:08,142 --> 00:39:09,077
in the place

00:39:09,143 --> 00:39:11,546
where you were sleeping.

00:39:11,612 --> 00:39:12,547
We found

00:39:12,613 --> 00:39:15,616
her dead body
inside this car.

00:39:18,686 --> 00:39:19,854
Why'd you pick that car,
Richard?

00:39:19,921 --> 00:39:22,390
I don't know what you mean.

00:39:22,457 --> 00:39:24,025
We found your fingerprint
inside the car.

00:39:24,092 --> 00:39:25,727
No, that
wasn't me.

00:39:25,793 --> 00:39:29,530
Tha-tha-that w... that was them.

00:39:29,597 --> 00:39:31,399
Who's them?

00:39:31,466 --> 00:39:33,634
I c... I can't talk no more.

00:39:36,671 --> 00:39:37,805
Come on. Tell the truth.

00:39:37,872 --> 00:39:39,006
Get him out of here.

00:39:39,073 --> 00:39:40,274
Not you.
Tell the truth.

00:39:40,341 --> 00:39:41,809
This is all your fault.
We'll take care of you.

00:39:41,876 --> 00:39:43,077
We'll get you into rehab.

00:39:43,144 --> 00:39:44,312
Come on.
There is no truth!

00:39:44,379 --> 00:39:47,548
Tell the truth!
There is no truth!

00:39:47,615 --> 00:39:49,050
Hey!

00:39:49,117 --> 00:39:51,486
As of right now, you're
suspended for two weeks.

00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:52,854
Grissom, you and I both know

00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,989
that Gedda killed that girl
and pinned it on that bum.

00:39:55,056 --> 00:39:56,324
They gave him drugs,
got him high,

00:39:56,391 --> 00:39:57,625
and planted
the evidence.

00:39:57,692 --> 00:39:59,460
You just got to give me
a chance to prove it.

00:39:59,527 --> 00:40:00,862
You've had all your chances.

00:40:00,928 --> 00:40:03,798
You take the suspension
or you're fired.

00:40:13,174 --> 00:40:16,711
(dialing phone)

00:40:16,778 --> 00:40:18,112
Hey.

00:40:18,179 --> 00:40:20,348
I got an update for you.

00:40:20,415 --> 00:40:22,617
He got suspended.

00:40:22,683 --> 00:40:24,685
Good work.
