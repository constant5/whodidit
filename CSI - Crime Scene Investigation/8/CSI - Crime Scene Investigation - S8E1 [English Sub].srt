<i>Previously on</i> CSI:

00:00:04,458 --> 00:00:05,760
GRISSOM:
<i>Her name is Natalie Davis.</i>

00:00:05,826 --> 00:00:08,229
<i>She works</i>
<i>for our janitorial service.</i>

00:00:08,296 --> 00:00:10,917
This girl holds me responsible
for the death of Ernie Dell.

00:00:10,984 --> 00:00:13,620
<i>I took away the only person</i>
<i>she ever loved</i>

00:00:13,686 --> 00:00:15,955
so she's going to do
the same thing to me.

00:00:16,022 --> 00:00:18,191
DAVIS:
Sara?

00:00:20,793 --> 00:00:23,363
Stop this!
Tell me where Sara is!

MAN (over radio):
All units, 444 in progress.

00:01:19,302 --> 00:01:21,437
Still no response from C-27.

00:01:21,504 --> 00:01:25,274
WFA, five foot-nine,
120, brown-green.

00:01:25,341 --> 00:01:26,576
Last known location:

00:01:26,643 --> 00:01:28,250
parking structure at Imperial
and Las Vegas Boulevard.

00:01:28,317 --> 00:01:30,319
SANDERS:
There are two cameras
on each level.

00:01:30,386 --> 00:01:33,556
This eye has the best view
of Sara's car.

00:01:33,623 --> 00:01:35,224
Great.

00:01:35,291 --> 00:01:36,917
Now if we could just see
what it saw.

00:01:36,984 --> 00:01:38,252
Where are the damn tapes?

00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:39,520
Like I've been telling everyone,

00:01:39,587 --> 00:01:40,921
this is a strip mall
not a casino.

00:01:40,988 --> 00:01:42,523
The feeds go off-site.

00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,958
My boss is bringing it
right now.

00:01:44,024 --> 00:01:45,192
You recognize this woman?

00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:46,760
(thunder crashing)

00:01:46,827 --> 00:01:48,195
No.

00:01:48,262 --> 00:01:49,263
What about her?

00:01:50,931 --> 00:01:53,267
Yeah, she, uh, she eats
at the veggie place

00:01:53,334 --> 00:01:54,735
a couple times a week,
downstairs.

00:01:54,802 --> 00:01:55,903
When was she here tonight?

00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:57,938
I don't know, like 7:30, maybe.

00:01:58,005 --> 00:01:59,273
That's when she usually comes.

00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,609
That gives us a time frame.

00:02:01,675 --> 00:02:03,477
I'll take care
of the tapes.

00:02:08,782 --> 00:02:10,784
(thunder crashing)

00:02:17,224 --> 00:02:19,426
(thunder crashing
in distance)

00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:45,486
A lot of desert
landscape drawings.

00:02:45,552 --> 00:02:47,955
STOKES:
The whole city's a desert.

00:02:48,022 --> 00:02:50,457
Could be anywhere.

00:02:57,898 --> 00:03:00,534
Warrick, take a look at this.

00:03:01,835 --> 00:03:05,172
In those photos of Natalie
observing Grissom and Sara

00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:06,607
at the crime scene,
I never remember a sketch pad

00:03:06,674 --> 00:03:08,776
or a camera in her hand
or anything like that.

00:03:08,842 --> 00:03:10,311
You saying she drew this
from memory?

00:03:10,377 --> 00:03:12,513
Well, maybe she's eidetic.

00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,747
You know, a human camera.

00:03:13,814 --> 00:03:17,083
The eyes snap a photo,
scan it to the brain.

00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,000
Great.

00:03:18,066 --> 00:03:20,458
Sara's location is probably
locked away inside of her head.

00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,753
(speaking quietly
and indistinctly)

00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:44,518

00:03:44,585 --> 00:03:46,000
Brown.

00:03:46,067 --> 00:03:48,636
Great. I'll take it.

00:03:48,702 --> 00:03:50,004
Keep it there.

00:03:50,071 --> 00:03:52,206
They found Natalie's
car on Fremont Street.

00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:53,474
All right, go ahead.

00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:56,010
I'm not leaving here
till I find something.

00:03:58,813 --> 00:04:01,649
(thunder crashing)

00:04:03,951 --> 00:04:06,454
BRASS:
I just got off the horn
with Search and Rescue.

00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,757
We have three choppers in the
air with night vision and IR.

00:04:09,824 --> 00:04:11,325
The weather's getting cooler,

00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:13,728
so a warm body
will be easier to find.

00:04:13,794 --> 00:04:16,297
If Sara's under the car,
the metal will conceal her.

00:04:16,363 --> 00:04:17,932
Maybe she got out.

00:04:17,998 --> 00:04:19,500
MAN (on TV):
They've just issued
a severe weather alert

00:04:19,567 --> 00:04:21,502
for north Las Vegas,
so let's go right to Gina

00:04:21,569 --> 00:04:24,271

on these thunderstorms.

00:04:24,338 --> 00:04:26,741
GINA:
Three thunderstorms
are converging

00:04:26,807 --> 00:04:28,476
and heading right for us.

00:04:28,542 --> 00:04:29,710
So, up to three inches of rain.

00:04:29,777 --> 00:04:31,579
They're expected to hit
in the next eight hours.

00:04:31,645 --> 00:04:33,614
Flash flood warnings
have been issued for the city

00:04:33,681 --> 00:04:35,683
and surrounding desert areas.

Natalie's been spending a lot
of time in the desert.

00:07:22,368 --> 00:07:24,170
About a dozen different spots,
all off the beaten path.

00:07:24,237 --> 00:07:27,841
No roads,
just general locations.

00:07:27,907 --> 00:07:29,008
Hang on.

00:07:29,075 --> 00:07:30,643
Warrick,
how far was the last trip?

00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,579
Give me a second,
I'm getting it right now.

00:07:34,013 --> 00:07:37,350
34 miles, one way.

00:07:37,417 --> 00:07:39,486
Nick, get all those locations
to Brass.

00:07:39,552 --> 00:07:41,221
Tell him to focus his search

00:07:41,287 --> 00:07:44,157
on any destination
within 34 miles.

00:07:44,224 --> 00:07:45,959
Done.

00:08:12,442 --> 00:08:13,810

00:08:13,876 --> 00:08:15,978
dementia.

00:08:16,679 --> 00:08:20,149
But not psychosis.

00:08:21,384 --> 00:08:23,953
(quietly):
They wouldn't understand.

00:08:24,834 --> 00:08:26,458
She said something.

00:08:26,525 --> 00:08:28,293
She's not talking to you.

00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,895
Or anyone else here.

00:08:29,962 --> 00:08:32,931
This patient is exhibiting
all the signs

00:08:32,998 --> 00:08:35,134
of a psychotic break:
delusions, hallucinations,

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,568
disorganized thought.

00:08:36,635 --> 00:08:38,170
How long is she going
to be like this?

00:08:38,237 --> 00:08:39,304
Days.

00:08:39,371 --> 00:08:40,439
Months.

00:08:40,506 --> 00:08:41,607
Any longer,

00:08:41,673 --> 00:08:44,143
we're looking
at schizophrenia.

Hello, Gilbert.

00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:35,094
GRISSOM:
Sara, we got an I.D.
on the miniature killer.

00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,528
Her name is Natalie Davis.

00:09:36,595 --> 00:09:37,896
One of Ernie Dell's fosters?

00:09:37,963 --> 00:09:40,933
Yeah. Catherine and I just spoke
to the biological father.

00:09:40,999 --> 00:09:42,801
He says he put Natalie
up for adoption

00:09:42,868 --> 00:09:45,270
after she shoved her kid sister
out of a tree house.

00:09:45,337 --> 00:09:46,772
Does he know where she is now?

00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:49,308
No, but with a name,
it's just a matter of time.

00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:50,743
All right, I'll be right there.

00:09:50,809 --> 00:09:52,511

I've seen you before, right?

00:19:33,301 --> 00:19:36,504
You work in the lab
on the cleaning crew.

00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:43,978
So sorry
about hitting you back there.

That's true, Natalie.

could ever love you.

We need a medevac
out here right now.

00:39:19,154 --> 00:39:21,857
Don't worry, we're going
to get you out of here, okay?

00:39:33,168 --> 00:39:36,004
They're coming for you now.

00:39:36,071 --> 00:39:38,207
You're going to
be okay, Sara.

00:39:38,273 --> 00:39:40,976
Here!

00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:49,284
MEDIC:
What have you got?

00:39:49,351 --> 00:39:51,887
CURTIS:
Female, 35, unconscious.

00:39:53,455 --> 00:39:55,724
STOKES:
She's been in the sun all day,
about 15 hours.

00:39:55,791 --> 00:39:57,159
She's not answering me at all.

00:39:57,226 --> 00:39:58,460
MEDIC 2:
Can we get a
blood pressure?

00:39:58,527 --> 00:39:59,962
MEDIC:
What's her name?
CURTIS:
Sara.

00:40:00,029 --> 00:40:02,798
Sara?! Sara,
can you hear me?!

00:40:02,865 --> 00:40:06,502
MEDIC:
Get that oxygen going.

00:40:06,568 --> 00:40:08,570
Put her on 15 liters.

00:40:12,041 --> 00:40:15,744
Give me an I.V.
prep tag.
I.V.

00:40:19,615 --> 00:40:21,717
Possible fracture,
left arm.

00:40:21,784 --> 00:40:24,019
Copy that.
How's the back look? Anything?

00:40:24,086 --> 00:40:26,088
Cervical's good,
spine's good.

00:40:26,155 --> 00:40:28,357
Do me a favor.
Hold that piece of tape.

00:40:28,424 --> 00:40:31,026
Get the arm in there.

00:40:32,061 --> 00:40:35,197
(medics shouting
indistinctly)

00:40:35,264 --> 00:40:36,865
On my count.
One, two, three.

00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:44,440
Let's go...

00:40:44,506 --> 00:40:46,308
(helicopter blades whirring)

00:40:51,647 --> 00:40:53,082
Where are you taking her?!

00:40:53,148 --> 00:40:54,283
Desert Palm!

00:40:54,349 --> 00:40:56,552
Move over!
I'm going with her!

00:40:59,221 --> 00:41:01,223
Switch off the oxygen.

00:41:20,142 --> 00:41:22,277
