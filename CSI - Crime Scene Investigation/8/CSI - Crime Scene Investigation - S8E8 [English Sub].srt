00:00:09,417 --> 00:00:10,500
Ecklie's been
on me


00:00:10,567 --> 00:00:11,507
to finish
the monthly stats,


00:00:11,574 --> 00:00:13,576
so I need a list
of all the Lab call-outs


00:00:13,643 --> 00:00:15,011
from Dispatch
as soon as you can.


00:00:15,078 --> 00:00:16,679
You'll have it by the
end of shift tomorrow.


00:00:16,746 --> 00:00:18,081
Thanks.


00:00:18,147 --> 00:00:20,083
So, you've been pulling a
lot of doubles this week.


00:00:20,149 --> 00:00:22,118
Yeah, it's
about all I do.


00:00:22,185 --> 00:00:24,120
Have you been in
touch with Sara?

00:00:24,187 --> 00:00:25,888
We've talked a little.

00:00:25,955 --> 00:00:27,390
So where's she at?

00:00:27,457 --> 00:00:28,958
San Francisco.
Visiting her mother.

00:00:29,025 --> 00:00:30,393
No, I mean--
that's nice.

00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,061
No, but I meant where's
she at emotionally?

00:00:32,128 --> 00:00:33,997
You know, with respect
to the two of you.

00:00:34,063 --> 00:00:35,231
I can't speak for her.

00:00:35,298 --> 00:00:37,233
So speak for
yourself.

00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,302
I can't talk,
I'm really busy.

00:01:08,898 --> 00:01:11,834
♪ ♪

00:01:40,663 --> 00:01:43,666

(manically laughing)

00:02:05,822 --> 00:02:09,092
So Archie's
in the Garage,

00:02:09,158 --> 00:02:11,094
he's documenting evidence
from a drug bust,

00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,762
he picks up a thing
of coke,

00:02:12,829 --> 00:02:14,764
and then it blows up
in his face?

00:02:14,831 --> 00:02:17,100
No. He picks up
a cellophane

00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:19,102
and duct-tape-wrapped
kilo of coke,

00:02:19,168 --> 00:02:21,271
and the third one from
the top of the stack

00:02:21,337 --> 00:02:22,538
blows up in
his face.
Oh.

00:02:22,605 --> 00:02:23,973
It's important to be specific.

00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,141
Okay, well,

00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:27,410
this game is not as much fun
as I thought

00:02:27,477 --> 00:02:29,012
it was going
to be--
It's not a game,

00:02:29,078 --> 00:02:30,146
it's a thought experiment.

I am a good criminalist.

00:02:32,682 --> 00:02:34,617
If you want to be a better
criminalist,

00:02:34,684 --> 00:02:37,220
then you have to learn
to train to--
Learn

00:02:37,287 --> 00:02:39,155
to think like a criminal.
I know.

00:02:39,222 --> 00:02:41,824
Look, I'm sure Grissom's
told you...

00:02:41,891 --> 00:02:44,694
well, maybe not you,
but he's told me many times:

00:02:44,761 --> 00:02:47,297
that we speak for the dead.

00:02:47,363 --> 00:02:49,599

exercise as a way

00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:51,668

Can we at least stipulate


00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,589
that they heroically contain
their bereavement?


00:04:07,656 --> 00:04:09,992
Yes, I suppose Archie
could live with that.


00:04:10,059 --> 00:04:11,593

HODGES:

00:04:18,867 --> 00:04:20,703
Yeah, he booby-trapped
the stash


00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:22,137
so if the cops got
the drugs...


00:04:22,204 --> 00:04:23,372
Then they would
get the boom


00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:24,707
along with it?
Right?


00:04:24,773 --> 00:04:26,075
Am I right?
No, you're wrong.


00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:27,509
Just let me finish the setup,


00:04:27,576 --> 00:04:28,877
okay?
Sorry.

00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:36,085
HODGES:
<i>Can you just let me finish!</i>


00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,090
According to this,
20 bricks of coke were logged


00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:44,126
into evidence
just past midnight.


00:04:44,193 --> 00:04:47,796
The explosion occurred
about a half an hour later.


00:04:47,863 --> 00:04:50,966
But there are 21
wrappers here.


00:04:51,033 --> 00:04:53,068
And since no one entered


00:04:53,135 --> 00:04:55,571
or exited the Lab
during that time frame,


00:04:55,637 --> 00:04:57,306
it means the explosive
was planted


00:04:57,373 --> 00:05:00,175
in the suitcase here.


00:05:00,242 --> 00:05:02,211
Which means...


00:05:02,277 --> 00:05:04,413
The killer is someone
in the Lab.


00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,417
Well, if the killer is someone
who works in the Lab,


00:05:08,484 --> 00:05:11,186
then he could just tamper
with the evidence.


00:05:11,253 --> 00:05:14,223
Which means that there's
really no way for me


00:05:14,289 --> 00:05:15,991
to solve this thing,
this a trick question.


00:05:16,058 --> 00:05:18,827
No, no, no, that's
not what I want...


00:05:18,894 --> 00:05:20,863
My shoelace is untied.


00:05:20,929 --> 00:05:22,698
Excuse me.
Okay.


00:05:22,765 --> 00:05:24,099
Okay, um...


00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:25,434
wouldn't, how
about this.


00:05:25,501 --> 00:05:26,769
Since it would be
pretty risky


00:05:26,835 --> 00:05:28,337
for the killer


00:05:28,404 --> 00:05:30,339
to tamper with evidence
during a full-on


00:05:30,406 --> 00:05:31,907
investigation in the Lab...
Mm-hmm.


00:05:31,974 --> 00:05:33,275
let's just say,


00:05:33,342 --> 00:05:35,277
for the purposes
of this exercise,


00:05:35,344 --> 00:05:37,413
that can't happen.


00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:38,747
Okay.


00:05:38,814 --> 00:05:39,848
Now what?


00:05:39,915 --> 00:05:41,684
That's up to you.


00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,519
You have the setup.


00:05:43,585 --> 00:05:45,054
You run the investigation
from here.


00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,622
Simple Q &amp; A.
You ask, I answer.


00:05:46,689 --> 00:05:47,956
Truthfully?


00:05:48,023 --> 00:05:49,358
Absolutely.


00:05:49,425 --> 00:05:51,393
No lying-- call that a rule.


00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,762
Well, what if I get close
to actually figuring it out,

00:05:53,829 --> 00:05:56,231
you're not just gonna change who
did it or something like that?

00:05:56,298 --> 00:05:58,067
No revisionism-- also a rule.

00:05:58,133 --> 00:05:59,301
For something
that's not a game

00:05:59,368 --> 00:06:01,136
it sure does have
a lot of rules.

00:06:01,203 --> 00:06:02,905
You want to do this or not?

00:06:02,971 --> 00:06:04,907
All right.

00:06:04,973 --> 00:06:06,742
Okay.

00:06:06,809 --> 00:06:08,610
I guess the first thing
that I would do

00:06:08,677 --> 00:06:11,847
would be to examine
the actual bomb mechanism

00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:13,749
to see if there's any clue
as to who might have built it.

00:06:13,816 --> 00:06:15,017
Good idea.

00:06:15,084 --> 00:06:16,518
Because there are a lot
of clues.

00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:26,695
Chemicals have been sent
to Trace for I.D.,

00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:30,199
but the bomb appears
to be a binary explosive.

00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:34,269
<i>Killer hides the loaded brick</i>
<i>amongst the others...</i>

00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,040
<i>A little pressure arms it...</i>

00:06:38,107 --> 00:06:41,377
<i>Liquid "A" in ampoule mixes</i>
<i>with solid "B",</i>

00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:44,847
<i>creating an unstable</i>
<i>chemical explosive...</i>

00:06:44,913 --> 00:06:47,316
<i>all you need to do is move it.</i>

00:07:09,705 --> 00:07:11,373
Ooh, I have an idea.

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,541
HODGES:
<i>What?</i>

00:07:12,608 --> 00:07:14,376
SIMMS:
<i>What about the blasting cap?</i>

00:07:14,443 --> 00:07:16,045
HODGES:
<i>Ah, well, what do you know?</i>

00:07:16,111 --> 00:07:18,047
<i>The leg wires are color coded.</i>

00:07:18,113 --> 00:07:19,548
SIMMS:
<i>Good, 'cause the color</i>

00:07:19,615 --> 00:07:21,383
coding is manufacturer
specific.

00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:23,052
So now we can track down
the source.

00:07:23,118 --> 00:07:24,586
Indeed we could.

00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:26,255
Hey, people.
What's going on?

00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:27,423
Nothing.

00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:29,258
You look... better.

00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:33,929
Let's say you learn

00:07:33,996 --> 00:07:36,498
that LVPD recently
seized one dozen

00:07:36,565 --> 00:07:38,233
commercial grade
blasting caps

00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,868
in an arson-explosives
raid,

00:07:39,935 --> 00:07:42,504
and that the Lab
was processing the
case evidence.

00:07:42,571 --> 00:07:45,107
Well, then, I know exactly
where I'd go next...

00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:47,276
'Course I know
where those blasting caps are.

00:07:47,343 --> 00:07:49,178
They're right in here.

00:07:49,244 --> 00:07:50,412
SIMMS:
<i>No, no, no, no, no.</i>

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:51,847
Not so fast, cowboy.

00:07:51,914 --> 00:07:54,083
Give me those keys.

00:08:14,542 --> 00:08:15,643
Looks like

00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,378
you're one blasting cap shy,
Bob.

00:08:17,445 --> 00:08:19,380
That's not possible.

00:08:20,414 --> 00:08:22,850
Wait...

00:08:22,917 --> 00:08:24,518
Y'all don't think
I had something

00:08:24,585 --> 00:08:26,587
to do with...

00:08:28,122 --> 00:08:29,557
Are there any prints
on the lock?

00:08:29,624 --> 00:08:30,725
Excuse me, we're--

00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:32,000
Playing a murder game.

00:08:32,067 --> 00:08:33,335
I know, I get it.

00:08:33,402 --> 00:08:34,503
I wanna play.

00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:36,004
He says
it's not a game.

00:08:36,071 --> 00:08:37,606
Well, I wanna play anyway.

00:08:37,673 --> 00:08:39,141
No.
Why not?

00:08:39,207 --> 00:08:40,642
You're the dead guy.

00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:41,977
Oh.

00:08:42,044 --> 00:08:43,579
Well, then I'd have
a vested interest

00:08:43,645 --> 00:08:44,813
in the outcome then,
wouldn't I?

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,515
Oh, come on,
I'll fill him in

00:08:46,582 --> 00:08:47,349
as we go along.

00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:50,452
Fine.

00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:52,120
Yup. So.

00:08:52,187 --> 00:08:53,956
Are there any prints
on the lock?

00:08:54,022 --> 00:08:56,024
HODGES:
<i>No, no prints.</i>

00:08:57,793 --> 00:09:00,662
Looks like this lock's
been slipped.

00:09:07,135 --> 00:09:10,072
So somebody stole the blasting
cap from Ballistics

00:09:10,138 --> 00:09:11,740
to make it look
like Bobby did it.

00:09:11,807 --> 00:09:13,342
Nefarious, don't
you think?

00:09:13,408 --> 00:09:14,977
What about the chemicals
that were used

00:09:15,043 --> 00:09:15,911
to make the explosive?

00:09:15,978 --> 00:09:18,380
Did we get anything back
from Trace?

00:09:20,415 --> 00:09:22,818
You always get something
from Trace.

00:09:22,884 --> 00:09:24,820
The explosive was
liquid nitro-acetate

00:09:24,886 --> 00:09:27,456
and solid ammonium nitrate
packed in baking soda.

00:09:27,522 --> 00:09:29,625
To blend in with the rest
of the cocaine bricks.

00:09:29,691 --> 00:09:30,959
Cute.

00:09:31,026 --> 00:09:33,462
Explosive liquids are
generally pretty volatile.

00:09:33,528 --> 00:09:34,863
Did you ask Hodges

00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:37,199
if nitro-acetate has any special
storage requirements?

00:09:37,266 --> 00:09:38,600
HODGES:
<i>It needs to be refrigerated.</i>

00:09:38,667 --> 00:09:40,636
Yeah, he said it needed
to be refrigerated.

00:09:40,702 --> 00:09:42,638
Well, there's only so many
refrigerators in the Lab.

00:09:42,704 --> 00:09:44,139
Maybe "where" can get us
to "who".

00:10:03,992 --> 00:10:05,427
What are you guys
looking for?

00:10:05,494 --> 00:10:07,195
I'm sorry, we can't
tell you that, Henry.

00:10:07,262 --> 00:10:08,564
Nitrogen

00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:09,598
tetra-hydride...

00:10:13,435 --> 00:10:14,303
Sodium nitrate.

00:10:14,369 --> 00:10:15,304
Wait, what happens

00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:16,371
when you mix
those two compounds?

00:10:16,438 --> 00:10:18,574
They produce nitro-acetate.

00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,208
That's a high explosive binary,
Henry.

00:10:20,275 --> 00:10:21,310
Really?

00:10:21,376 --> 00:10:22,644
I didn't know that.

00:10:22,711 --> 00:10:25,647
Look, just 'cause I
have those compounds

00:10:25,714 --> 00:10:26,748
in my fridge
doesn't mean

00:10:26,815 --> 00:10:28,617
I used them to make
nitro-acetate.

00:10:28,684 --> 00:10:30,619
You can't
prove that.

00:10:30,686 --> 00:10:34,256
Baking soda was used to conceal
the explosive, smartass.

00:10:34,323 --> 00:10:36,258
It's also used to
absorb odors.

00:10:36,325 --> 00:10:38,760
Nice smell is a priority
of my life.

00:10:38,827 --> 00:10:41,096
I think the baking soda was used

00:10:41,163 --> 00:10:43,198
to absorb a lot more than odors,
Henry.

00:11:10,225 --> 00:11:12,494
Okay, I confess,
I did it!

00:11:12,561 --> 00:11:14,296
Henry?

00:11:14,363 --> 00:11:15,964
Why would Henry kill me?

00:11:16,031 --> 00:11:18,959
We're not supposed to care
about the why.

00:11:19,026 --> 00:11:20,394
Whatever.

00:11:23,364 --> 00:11:24,665
...with us
for that.

00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:25,935
Hey, fellas.
Hey.

00:11:26,001 --> 00:11:27,836
Thanks for giving me
justice at least.

00:11:27,903 --> 00:11:29,838
Yeah, you're welcome.

00:11:29,905 --> 00:11:31,840
Man, I don't know
if I'm more tired

00:11:31,907 --> 00:11:32,942
or hungry right now.

00:11:33,008 --> 00:11:34,610
You wanna get something
to eat?
Yeah.

00:11:34,677 --> 00:11:36,245
Actually, I felt like
a little Pai Gow

00:11:36,312 --> 00:11:37,279
or some Blackjack.

00:11:37,346 --> 00:11:38,781
Let's hit the Strip.

00:11:38,847 --> 00:11:40,783
After the shift
we just pulled?
Yeah.

00:11:40,849 --> 00:11:42,551
I just drank one of
those energy drinks.

00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:44,320
I probably won't sleep for
another couple hours.

00:11:44,386 --> 00:11:45,921
I don't think so,
man.

00:11:45,988 --> 00:11:47,256
Maybe another time,
huh?

00:11:47,323 --> 00:11:48,624
All right.

00:11:48,691 --> 00:11:50,693
I'll catch ya later.

00:11:53,128 --> 00:11:54,263
All right, Grissom.

00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:56,398
That's it for me.
I'm out of here.

00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:58,467
Have a nice day.

00:12:00,135 --> 00:12:02,338
Yeah, I'm going over to Frank's

00:12:02,404 --> 00:12:03,606
to grab something to eat.

00:12:03,672 --> 00:12:05,040
I'll probably be there
for at least an hour

00:12:05,107 --> 00:12:07,743
if you want to...
if you want to join me.

00:12:09,244 --> 00:12:12,281
You know, we don't have to talk
about anything in particular.

00:12:12,348 --> 00:12:15,184
Just two guys
having breakfast.

00:12:15,251 --> 00:12:17,019
I just don't think
it's good for people

00:12:17,086 --> 00:12:18,887
to be alone too much.

00:12:19,955 --> 00:12:22,358
If you want to, cool.
If not, cool.

00:12:22,424 --> 00:12:23,892
Whatever.

00:12:28,097 --> 00:12:29,765
Hi.

00:12:34,136 --> 00:12:36,038
Rack 'em up.

00:12:36,105 --> 00:12:37,439
Excuse me?

00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:39,541
Well, word on campus is,
there's a murder game going on.

00:12:39,608 --> 00:12:41,143
Oh, no, no, no,
it's not a game.

00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:43,579
It's a thought experiment.

00:12:43,646 --> 00:12:44,780
Sounds like the late
Archie Johnson

00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,448
has a big mouth.

00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:49,084
Come on, please, it's been
really slow at Prints all day.

00:12:49,151 --> 00:12:50,653
Who we killin'?

00:12:52,554 --> 00:12:56,659
Henry, I need the tox
on that lady, um...

00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:58,794
(screaming)

00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:01,196
Henry!

00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,352
No sign of
sexual trauma.

00:13:09,419 --> 00:13:11,500
Thank God for small favors.

00:13:11,567 --> 00:13:13,769
You know, David,
our job is never easy,

00:13:13,836 --> 00:13:16,038
but this is a colleague.

00:13:16,105 --> 00:13:18,074
If your emotions are too raw

00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,776
and you feel you need
to excuse yourself...

00:13:20,843 --> 00:13:21,978
Look.
(crunching)

00:13:22,044 --> 00:13:23,379
He's crunchy.

00:13:23,446 --> 00:13:25,248
Um...
(crunching)

00:13:33,356 --> 00:13:35,725
Frozen sweat stains. Yuck.

00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:40,263
He was trapped in a small space
at minus ten degrees centigrade.

00:13:40,329 --> 00:13:43,332
So it's fair to assume
he was exerting himself

00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:45,801
in a state
of mind-numbing terror.

00:13:45,868 --> 00:13:48,671
How long do you think
he was stuck in there?

00:13:48,738 --> 00:13:50,473
(sharp crack)

00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:51,941
Well, several hours at least.

00:13:52,008 --> 00:13:53,843
Time of exposure
in extreme cold

00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,945
is difficult to gauge
physiologically.

00:13:56,012 --> 00:13:59,749
Why don't you let me know
when he softens up

00:13:59,815 --> 00:14:02,018
and we'll start cutting.

00:14:02,084 --> 00:14:04,754
So we're just going to
wait for him to thaw?

00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:07,990
What do you want me to do,
stick him in a microwave?

00:14:08,057 --> 00:14:10,059
(microwave beeping)

00:14:12,728 --> 00:14:13,963
Ooh...

00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:16,465
Hot... hot, hot, hot.

00:14:16,532 --> 00:14:19,802
So, then, okay,
Henry froze to death.

00:14:19,869 --> 00:14:21,337
Well, maybe not.

00:14:21,404 --> 00:14:24,040
Because if the autopsy
hasn't been performed yet,

00:14:24,106 --> 00:14:25,841
then we can't be sure
that's COD.

00:14:25,908 --> 00:14:27,476
Well played, Simms.

00:14:27,543 --> 00:14:28,711
So it takes a few turns

00:14:28,778 --> 00:14:31,147
for the autopsy results
to get back.
Turns?

00:14:31,214 --> 00:14:32,882
Hours. A few hours.

00:14:32,949 --> 00:14:35,151
So, while you're waiting
for the autopsy results,

00:14:35,218 --> 00:14:36,719
what do you do
in the meantime?

00:14:36,786 --> 00:14:38,988
Well, the CSIs would
process the freezer.

00:14:39,055 --> 00:14:40,289
Did they find anything?

00:14:40,356 --> 00:14:42,491
A virtual cornucopia.

00:14:42,558 --> 00:14:45,428
(digital camera clicking
quietly)

00:14:53,469 --> 00:14:56,872
WILLOWS:
The condition of the interior
could be the result

00:14:56,939 --> 00:14:58,541
of a struggle,

00:14:58,608 --> 00:15:01,744
or the simple,
understandable panic

00:15:01,811 --> 00:15:04,380
of a man trapped
inside a freezer.

00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:07,149
In any event,
the emergency release handle

00:15:07,216 --> 00:15:10,353
appears to have been bent
and rendered inoperative,

00:15:10,419 --> 00:15:13,823
and several chemical containers
broken in the process

00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:16,525
possibly releasing chloroform

00:15:16,592 --> 00:15:18,527
and methyl ethyl ketone
into the space.

00:15:18,594 --> 00:15:22,298
I'm sending samples to Trace
to confirm.

00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,435
(laughs):
Trace.

00:15:26,502 --> 00:15:29,238
Is there anything you can't do?

00:15:29,305 --> 00:15:29,872
Hodges.

00:15:29,939 --> 00:15:30,806
Sorry.

00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:45,288
This could be a case
of lab geek humor gone wrong.

00:16:00,536 --> 00:16:02,572
Hello?

00:16:02,638 --> 00:16:04,140
Hello!

00:16:04,207 --> 00:16:07,510
Hello?! It's not funny!

00:16:09,345 --> 00:16:11,480
(grunts, glass shatters)

00:16:17,353 --> 00:16:19,155
Oh, my God.

00:16:19,222 --> 00:16:21,490
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, help!

00:16:21,557 --> 00:16:22,925
(panting)

00:16:22,992 --> 00:16:24,393
(yells in frustration)

00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:26,062
Help me!

00:16:26,128 --> 00:16:28,898
(muffled):
Please help!

00:16:28,965 --> 00:16:30,800
So the merry prankster
comes back later,

00:16:30,866 --> 00:16:32,635
sees the joke gone bad,

00:16:32,702 --> 00:16:34,604
then he just yanks the pin
and scrams.

00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:38,107
You said that the emergency
release plunger was bent.

00:16:38,174 --> 00:16:39,141
Mm-hmm.

00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,577
Well, that thing is made
of solid steel.

00:16:41,644 --> 00:16:42,778
How could Henry do that?

00:16:42,845 --> 00:16:43,946
Adrenaline kicks in

00:16:44,013 --> 00:16:45,781
when he finally realizes
that he's dying.

00:16:45,848 --> 00:16:48,251
So, maybe in the moment
of crisis,

00:16:48,317 --> 00:16:50,353
Henry has the strength
of ten men.

00:16:50,419 --> 00:16:52,488
Ten small men.

00:16:52,555 --> 00:16:53,756
(chuckles)

00:16:53,823 --> 00:16:55,024
"Maybe."

00:16:55,091 --> 00:16:56,993
That word always looks
so good on a case report.

00:16:57,059 --> 00:16:59,295
Was there any evidence
on the handle

00:16:59,362 --> 00:17:00,162
on the outside of the freezer?

00:17:00,229 --> 00:17:01,731
Just a schmear.

00:17:02,765 --> 00:17:05,635
<i>Sugar, soy protein,</i>

00:17:05,701 --> 00:17:07,637
<i>partially hydrogenated</i>
<i>vegetable oils,</i>

00:17:07,703 --> 00:17:10,139
<i>roasted nuts.</i>

00:17:10,206 --> 00:17:11,707
Peanut butter?

00:17:11,774 --> 00:17:13,509
WEBSTER:
Well, killer's got to eat, too.

00:17:13,576 --> 00:17:15,578
SIMMS:
So, CSIs would check
every trash can

00:17:15,645 --> 00:17:18,447
and every bio hazard disposal
unit in the whole Lab.

00:17:18,514 --> 00:17:21,150
HODGES:
Yes, the would,
and they would find...

00:17:25,054 --> 00:17:26,389
What, no jelly?

00:17:26,455 --> 00:17:28,791
We found the peanut butter
from inside your glove.

00:17:28,858 --> 00:17:32,562
It matches the stuff we found
on the freezer door handle.

00:17:32,628 --> 00:17:33,963
Chunky, right?

00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:35,598
I didn't kill Henry.

00:17:35,665 --> 00:17:37,066
Well, not on purpose.

00:17:37,133 --> 00:17:39,302
No, not even by accident.

00:17:39,368 --> 00:17:42,638
I only had a couple of minutes
for lunch,

00:17:42,705 --> 00:17:44,307
and I had a bunch
of photo emulsion sheets

00:17:44,373 --> 00:17:45,741
that needed to be stored.

00:17:45,808 --> 00:17:47,176
And I store them in the freezer.

00:17:47,243 --> 00:17:50,213
You seem very tense.

00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:53,883
You know, I don't really like
being persecuted.

00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,952
Yeah.

00:17:57,954 --> 00:18:00,823
Get used to it, punk.

00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:01,724
No, I don't know about that.

00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:03,159
What?
Well, Bobby's a gun guy.

00:18:03,226 --> 00:18:05,027
Gun guys shoot people.

00:18:05,094 --> 00:18:06,729
Gun guys don't shoot people.

00:18:06,796 --> 00:18:07,997
People shoot people.

00:18:08,064 --> 00:18:11,133
Actually, bullets shoot people,
shot from guns

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,702
which are usually in the hands
of gun guys.

00:18:12,768 --> 00:18:14,103
Can we get the autopsy results?

00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:16,305
Well, I guess Henry's had
enough time to defrost.

00:18:16,372 --> 00:18:19,342
COD was not, in fact,
due to hypothermia.

00:18:19,408 --> 00:18:21,344
Ooh, wait, no, I can guess
what they found in Tox.

00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:22,545
It was chloroform.

00:18:22,612 --> 00:18:23,379
Nope.

00:18:23,446 --> 00:18:24,447
Methyl ethyl ether?

00:18:24,513 --> 00:18:25,348
PCP.

00:18:25,414 --> 00:18:26,382
What?

00:18:26,449 --> 00:18:28,551
Massive, overdose amounts
of PCP.

00:18:28,618 --> 00:18:32,421
Commonly known as phencyclidine,
or angel dust.

00:18:32,488 --> 00:18:36,325
<i>PCP blocks the brain's</i>
<i>NMDA receptors,</i>

00:18:36,392 --> 00:18:39,528
<i>hypothalamus goes nuts,</i>
<i>resulting in anxiety,</i>

00:18:39,595 --> 00:18:42,031
<i>confusion,</i>
<i>and fever-like overheating.</i>

00:18:42,098 --> 00:18:44,834
(yelling)

00:18:44,901 --> 00:18:48,537
WEBSTER:
<i>So Henry goes into the cooler</i>
<i>to cool off...</i>

00:18:48,604 --> 00:18:51,741
SIMMS:
<i>And with the PCP stimulating</i>
<i>his adrenal glands,</i>

00:18:51,807 --> 00:18:54,677
<i>he has the strength</i>
<i>of the Incredible Hulk.</i>

00:18:54,744 --> 00:18:56,913
(frantic yelling)

00:18:58,047 --> 00:18:59,382
ANDREWS:
<i>A duster?</i>

00:18:59,448 --> 00:19:00,883
You made me a lousy duster?

00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,151
That is totally bogus.

00:19:02,218 --> 00:19:03,452
Aside from the 10,000

00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:06,422
other reasons
why I'd be crazy

00:19:06,489 --> 00:19:09,559
to even try that junk,
if I were a closet PCP freak,

00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:11,227
I wouldn't do it in the Lab.

00:19:11,294 --> 00:19:12,562
That's very professional.

00:19:12,628 --> 00:19:14,330
Archie told me
about your sick

00:19:14,397 --> 00:19:16,065
little thought experiment,
and I want to play.

00:19:16,132 --> 00:19:17,867
But I still can't believe,
even hypothetically,

00:19:17,934 --> 00:19:19,168
you'd do something
like this to me.

00:19:19,235 --> 00:19:21,304
Well, Henry, I hypothetically
called your mother

00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:22,738
and I explained everything.

00:19:22,805 --> 00:19:25,074
That woman is a crier.

00:19:25,141 --> 00:19:26,175
Your autopsy didn't mention

00:19:26,242 --> 00:19:28,811
powder in
his nasal passages

00:19:28,878 --> 00:19:30,079
or PCP damage in his lungs.

00:19:30,146 --> 00:19:31,647
That's because it wasn't there.

00:19:31,714 --> 00:19:32,747
So Henry didn't inhale it,
or smoke it, or snort it?

00:19:32,814 --> 00:19:35,116
No, he didn't.

00:19:35,183 --> 00:19:37,485
Then how did the PCP
get into my system?

00:19:37,552 --> 00:19:39,988
You tell me.

00:19:41,523 --> 00:19:42,824
Oh!

00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:44,325
Crusty pits.

00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:47,250
Sweat stains.

00:19:47,317 --> 00:19:49,419
You said that Henry's lab coat
had big sweat stains

00:19:49,486 --> 00:19:51,021
on the collar
and on the armpits.

00:19:51,088 --> 00:19:53,657
So that's it--
somebody dosed the coat.

00:20:05,068 --> 00:20:06,570
(crackling)

00:20:08,472 --> 00:20:12,376
<i>Lab coat tests positive</i>
<i>for PCP.</i>

00:20:12,442 --> 00:20:15,078
Combined with body heat
and sweat,

00:20:15,145 --> 00:20:17,481
the drug must've entered
his system transdermally.

00:20:17,547 --> 00:20:20,717
Like a nicotine patch from hell.

00:20:20,784 --> 00:20:24,321
Well, Henry would've died
of an overdose no matter what.

00:20:24,388 --> 00:20:26,556
So, all the trapping him
in the freezer

00:20:26,623 --> 00:20:28,291
with the
chemicals spilling,

00:20:28,358 --> 00:20:31,295
that was all
completely incidental.

00:20:31,361 --> 00:20:33,897
It was the logical outcome
of the initial crime.

00:20:33,964 --> 00:20:35,265
And it's quite funny.

00:20:35,332 --> 00:20:35,932
Hey.

00:20:35,999 --> 00:20:38,902
Well, we're not done yet.

00:20:38,969 --> 00:20:40,337
Who did the deed?

00:20:40,404 --> 00:20:42,072
Well, taking lab coats

00:20:42,139 --> 00:20:44,141
off the premises
is against regulations.

00:20:44,207 --> 00:20:47,044
So the PCP would've had to have
been applied in the Lab,

00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,578
right under our noses.

00:20:48,645 --> 00:20:49,579
And that stuff reeks.

00:20:49,646 --> 00:20:50,814
I have to crank
my fume hood up full

00:20:50,881 --> 00:20:52,683
whenever I work with it,
I still go home with a headache.

00:20:52,749 --> 00:20:55,085
Fume hoods. There's fume hoods
in the Garage,

00:20:55,152 --> 00:20:56,987
<i>and DNA and Trace.</i>

00:20:57,054 --> 00:20:58,288
<i>So we would have to test</i>
<i>all the sinks for PCP.</i>

00:20:58,355 --> 00:20:59,423
HODGES:
<i>Excellent.</i>

00:20:59,489 --> 00:21:00,991
<i>That's a good approach.</i>

00:21:08,231 --> 00:21:10,334
(crackling)

00:21:12,202 --> 00:21:13,503
HODGES:
<i>But you would find nothing.</i>

00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:14,938
SIMMS:
<i>Really?</i>

00:21:15,005 --> 00:21:17,708
<i>Yeah, there's no trace of PCP</i>
<i>in any of sinks.</i>

00:21:17,774 --> 00:21:19,376
<i>Squeaky clean.</i>

00:21:19,443 --> 00:21:20,644
Damn it.

00:21:33,423 --> 00:21:35,525
Oh! Wait.

00:21:35,592 --> 00:21:38,061
I got it, check the plant.

00:21:38,128 --> 00:21:40,731
HODGES:
<i>You got it.</i>

00:21:43,033 --> 00:21:46,970
<i>The killer cleaned up,</i>
<i>but he left one witness.</i>

00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,214
Wendy.

00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,382
Me?

00:21:58,448 --> 00:22:00,050
Oh, drat.

00:22:00,117 --> 00:22:02,886
Well, it's not a slow day
for me after all.

00:22:02,953 --> 00:22:05,188
Ecklie wants me to pick up
the backlog from Swing.

00:22:05,255 --> 00:22:07,157
Somebody please tell me
who dies next.

00:22:07,224 --> 00:22:08,725
And how.
Thank you.

00:22:08,792 --> 00:22:10,260
So...

00:22:10,327 --> 00:22:12,029
You got time for one more?

00:22:12,095 --> 00:22:13,563
Well, someone's having fun.

00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:14,698
Maybe a little.

00:22:14,765 --> 00:22:16,400
You're not bad at this.

00:22:16,466 --> 00:22:18,001
SIMMS:
Thanks.

00:22:18,068 --> 00:22:20,037
I've been thinking about taking
the CSI field test.

00:22:20,103 --> 00:22:22,706
This is actually really good
theory and practice for me.

00:22:22,773 --> 00:22:24,041
The field test?

00:22:24,107 --> 00:22:25,108
Yeah.

00:22:25,175 --> 00:22:27,077
What?

00:22:27,144 --> 00:22:27,878
Why?

00:22:27,944 --> 00:22:28,779
Nothing.

00:22:28,845 --> 00:22:29,546
Nothing?

00:22:29,613 --> 00:22:30,681
That's right.

00:22:30,747 --> 00:22:32,149
A great big pile of nothing.

00:22:32,215 --> 00:22:33,917
From me, to you.

00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,254
Oh, hey.

00:22:37,321 --> 00:22:38,655
How are you?

00:22:38,722 --> 00:22:40,223
Why?

00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:41,925
I can't ask how
you're doing?

00:22:41,992 --> 00:22:43,427
I'm sorry.

00:22:43,493 --> 00:22:45,295
I've just had
a lot of, uh...

00:22:45,362 --> 00:22:46,697
I've been busy.

00:22:46,763 --> 00:22:47,931
Oh.

00:22:47,998 --> 00:22:50,534
Well, maybe you should
take a few days off,

00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,902
for once in your career.

00:22:51,969 --> 00:22:53,537
I mean, you've got
enough stored up.

00:22:53,603 --> 00:22:56,907
Go after her.

00:22:56,974 --> 00:22:58,575
It's not what she wants.

00:22:58,642 --> 00:23:00,344
What do you want?

00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:03,180
I want her to be happy.

00:23:04,214 --> 00:23:05,749
Field Agent Simms.

00:23:05,816 --> 00:23:07,417
Stop it.

00:23:07,484 --> 00:23:09,386
Hey, I think it's got
a nice ring to it.
Thank you.

00:23:09,453 --> 00:23:11,588
Here she comes,
flashing her badge,

00:23:11,655 --> 00:23:12,723
taking down perps.

00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:13,890
Why is even potential
advancement

00:23:13,957 --> 00:23:15,559
so threatening to you?

00:23:15,625 --> 00:23:17,594
Hey, Sanders left the lab,
he got his ass kicked.

00:23:17,661 --> 00:23:18,962
I'm just saying.

00:23:20,497 --> 00:23:22,265
All right, come on,
let's do another one.

00:23:22,332 --> 00:23:23,467
Okay. Fine.

00:23:23,533 --> 00:23:26,136
Let's.

00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:44,064
SIMMS:
<i>Well, now, that's a little</i>
<i>passive-aggressive,</i>

00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:45,711
<i>don't you think?</i>

00:23:50,337 --> 00:23:54,742
(camera shutter clicking)

00:24:05,708 --> 00:24:07,777
No kidding.

00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,355
It appears as though

00:24:19,422 --> 00:24:21,524
the vic struck the edge
of the table.

00:24:28,697 --> 00:24:30,933
The evidence
on the floor is...

00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,302
well, evidence.

00:24:33,369 --> 00:24:35,838
Brown paper bindle
must have opened when it fell.

00:24:35,905 --> 00:24:39,275
Looks like the contents
of a woman's purse.

00:24:39,341 --> 00:24:41,177
And here's the vic's other shoe.

00:24:41,243 --> 00:24:45,681
SIMMS:
Square toe, low heel,
stylish but affordable.

00:24:45,748 --> 00:24:47,483
Flirty, not whory.

00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:48,584
You will be missed.

00:24:48,651 --> 00:24:52,221
There's an oily residue
on the sole.

00:25:05,367 --> 00:25:08,834
SANDERS:
<i>The evidence appears to lead</i>
<i>to an inescapable conclusion.</i>

00:25:08,901 --> 00:25:11,637
<i>This tragedy might have just</i>
<i>simply been the result</i>

00:25:11,704 --> 00:25:14,773
<i>of an accident</i>
<i>in the workplace.</i>

00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,709
SIMMS:
<i>I fell off a ladder?</i>

00:25:16,775 --> 00:25:18,110
Well, you are kind
of little clumsy.

00:25:18,177 --> 00:25:19,278
Since when?

00:25:19,345 --> 00:25:20,446
It's endearing.

00:25:20,512 --> 00:25:22,247
HODGES:
Are you satisfied

00:25:22,314 --> 00:25:23,282
with the explanation?

00:25:23,349 --> 00:25:24,450
SIMMS:
Uh, no.

00:25:24,516 --> 00:25:26,585
What about the oily residue
on the ladder?

00:25:26,652 --> 00:25:29,755
<i>There are bristles in the oil,</i>

00:25:29,822 --> 00:25:31,890
<i>which means</i>
<i>that somebody brushed it on.</i>

00:25:31,957 --> 00:25:33,792
ANDREWS:
<i>What exactly is the oily stuff?</i>

00:25:33,859 --> 00:25:35,327
Well, thank God...

00:25:35,394 --> 00:25:37,596
...for trace analysis.

00:25:37,663 --> 00:25:39,064
Hmm.

00:25:39,131 --> 00:25:44,003
Hodges, who is a genius
and tragically underpaid,

00:25:44,069 --> 00:25:45,871
used the powers
of his brilliant mind

00:25:45,938 --> 00:25:47,506
and the scientific method

00:25:47,573 --> 00:25:49,608
to discover that the oil
that was brushed

00:25:49,675 --> 00:25:54,446
on the ladder was a Teflon-based
two-part oil.

00:25:54,513 --> 00:25:56,081
A gun lubricant.

00:25:56,148 --> 00:25:58,450
So?

00:25:58,517 --> 00:26:01,920
So you're the gun guy, Bobby.

00:26:01,987 --> 00:26:03,288
Yeah, which is exactly why

00:26:03,355 --> 00:26:05,924
I would never use
Teflon-based two-part oil.

00:26:05,991 --> 00:26:08,594
Real gun guys hate that stuff.

00:26:08,661 --> 00:26:11,296
If it separates in the can,
it separates in the gun.

00:26:11,363 --> 00:26:13,098
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:26:13,165 --> 00:26:14,266
Whoa. You are tense.

00:26:14,333 --> 00:26:15,801
So, where do you think
you're going?

00:26:15,868 --> 00:26:16,969
Back to work.

00:26:17,036 --> 00:26:18,437
This is ridiculous.
Oh.

00:26:18,504 --> 00:26:21,206
Sit down.

00:26:21,273 --> 00:26:23,108
(whipping)

00:26:23,175 --> 00:26:24,243
Ow!

00:26:24,309 --> 00:26:26,745
No, no. Captain Brass
is not the kind of cop

00:26:26,812 --> 00:26:27,980
who smacks a suspect around.

00:26:28,047 --> 00:26:29,815
Really? Scares me.

00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:34,920
Oh, well, look
who's the clumsy one now.

00:26:34,987 --> 00:26:36,822
Excuse me.

00:26:36,889 --> 00:26:40,159
Okay, so we don't have nearly
enough to hold Bobby, right?

00:26:40,225 --> 00:26:41,327
No.

00:26:44,163 --> 00:26:45,197
All right.

00:26:45,264 --> 00:26:47,132
Who's up for an autopsy?

00:26:48,567 --> 00:26:51,437
ROBBINS:
The carotid-jugular complex
was transected,

00:26:51,503 --> 00:26:54,506
and based on the placement
and size of the wound,

00:26:54,573 --> 00:26:56,575
I'd say she had at...

00:26:56,642 --> 00:26:59,978
Hey, it's a neck wound.

00:27:02,014 --> 00:27:03,549
Based on the placement

00:27:03,615 --> 00:27:05,551
and size of
the neck wound,

00:27:05,617 --> 00:27:07,119
she was conscious 30
to 60 seconds

00:27:07,186 --> 00:27:08,287
before blood loss was fatal.

00:27:08,354 --> 00:27:10,222
That's a long time.

00:27:10,289 --> 00:27:13,492
No one reported her screaming
or calling out for help.

00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:14,827
We have to get back
to the case file.

00:27:19,064 --> 00:27:23,969
There was no blood
on her hands at the scene.

00:27:24,036 --> 00:27:25,371
Unless she was unconscious,

00:27:25,437 --> 00:27:28,040
she would have at least tried
to stop the bleeding.

00:27:28,107 --> 00:27:29,375
Well, there was no blow
to the head.

00:27:29,441 --> 00:27:30,542
Do you think it's possible

00:27:30,609 --> 00:27:31,810
she was dead
before she hit the table?

00:27:31,877 --> 00:27:34,213
You mean like
a cardiac event?

00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:35,748
I can't rule that out,

00:27:35,814 --> 00:27:39,485
but a healthy, 36-year-old
having a heart attack?

00:27:39,551 --> 00:27:42,187
SIMMS:
35 in October,
thank you very much.

00:27:46,392 --> 00:27:49,094
She has a oval, perimortem burn
on her wrist.

00:27:49,161 --> 00:27:50,529
Wait a second.
That's familiar.

00:28:04,743 --> 00:28:06,712
(electrical sizzling)

00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:08,380
Singed right off

00:28:08,447 --> 00:28:10,115
her barely
35-year-old wrist.

00:28:10,182 --> 00:28:12,151
That bracelet wasn't
old evidence.

00:28:12,217 --> 00:28:13,686
I was wearing it.

00:28:13,752 --> 00:28:15,020
Correct.

00:28:15,087 --> 00:28:17,256
So, what
melts silver

00:28:17,323 --> 00:28:19,792
and stops your heart
at the same time?

00:28:19,858 --> 00:28:21,393
A bolt of lightning.

00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,361
In the lab.

00:28:22,428 --> 00:28:23,562
Electrocution.

00:28:23,629 --> 00:28:24,296
From what?

00:28:24,363 --> 00:28:26,231
Something
in the Evidence Locker.

00:28:55,361 --> 00:28:59,298
SIMMS:
<i>There was a motorcycle battery</i>
<i>in the ventilation duct?</i>

00:28:59,365 --> 00:29:03,068
ANDREWS:
<i>Wired to the ladder</i>
<i>and the evidence box?</i>

00:29:03,135 --> 00:29:05,204
HODGES:
<i>Precisely.</i>

00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,875
(electrical sizzling)

00:29:11,543 --> 00:29:13,178
(electrical sizzling)

00:29:13,245 --> 00:29:15,647
Devilishly clever,
wouldn't you say?

00:29:15,714 --> 00:29:16,582
No.

00:29:16,648 --> 00:29:18,350
Well, who's the killer,
Wile E. Coyote?

00:29:18,417 --> 00:29:21,120
What do you mean?
ANDREWS:
It's ridiculous!

00:29:21,186 --> 00:29:23,122
Anyone could have walked
in there.

00:29:23,188 --> 00:29:24,657
So, what, the
victim's just random?

00:29:24,723 --> 00:29:25,991
Uh, no.

00:29:26,058 --> 00:29:28,160
How'd the killer get me up there
in the first place?

00:29:28,227 --> 00:29:29,495
What did he do, pass
me in the hall and say,

00:29:29,561 --> 00:29:30,663
"Hey, Wendy, go
climb up that ladder

00:29:30,729 --> 00:29:31,830
"and check out the case evidence

00:29:31,897 --> 00:29:33,265
you had absolutely nothing
to do with?"

00:29:33,332 --> 00:29:36,035
Not in those words exactly,
but, uh, yeah.

00:29:36,101 --> 00:29:37,302
That's completely
unverifiable.

00:29:37,369 --> 00:29:38,504
This is so lame.

00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:41,140
Scenario requires
further revision.

00:29:41,206 --> 00:29:42,207
Okay, what is that?

00:29:42,274 --> 00:29:44,043
Nothing.

00:29:48,614 --> 00:29:49,815
Is that a tape recorder?

00:29:49,882 --> 00:29:51,517
You are so paranoid.

00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:54,019
This thought experiment

00:29:54,086 --> 00:29:56,155
has now concluded.
Thank you.

00:30:02,387 --> 00:30:03,762
Why were you
recording us?

00:30:03,829 --> 00:30:06,365
I wasn't recording you.

00:30:06,432 --> 00:30:08,600
Why would I record you?
That makes no sense.

00:30:15,174 --> 00:30:19,044
"Lab Rats."

00:30:19,111 --> 00:30:20,746
"The Game of Science
and Murder."

00:30:20,813 --> 00:30:22,014
It's a prototype.

00:30:22,081 --> 00:30:23,282
"Two to four players,

00:30:23,348 --> 00:30:25,117
ages eight and up."

00:30:25,184 --> 00:30:27,019
You're making a board game?

00:30:27,086 --> 00:30:30,189
Well, it's not just
a board game.

00:30:30,255 --> 00:30:32,191
Gets people to think.

00:30:32,257 --> 00:30:33,692
Why were you
recording us?

00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:34,927
(sighs)

00:30:34,993 --> 00:30:37,730
I needed your help
to flesh out scenarios,

00:30:37,796 --> 00:30:40,232
and I figured that
if I hid the recorder,

00:30:40,299 --> 00:30:42,735
your answers would be candid
and honest.

00:30:42,801 --> 00:30:44,803
Look, see.

00:30:47,239 --> 00:30:49,975
It's like Clue,

00:30:50,042 --> 00:30:53,245
only CSI-ier.

00:30:55,114 --> 00:30:56,982
Hodges, this is, uh...

00:30:57,049 --> 00:30:58,784
This is kind of impressive.

00:31:00,786 --> 00:31:03,355
In a painfully sad,

00:31:03,422 --> 00:31:05,924
geek type of way.

00:31:05,991 --> 00:31:07,926
Well, painfully sad geeks

00:31:07,993 --> 00:31:10,596
have a lot of spare time
on their hands

00:31:10,662 --> 00:31:12,664
and loads of disposable income.

00:31:12,731 --> 00:31:14,466
Lab Rats could be a gold mine.

00:31:18,904 --> 00:31:20,005
Oh!

00:31:20,072 --> 00:31:22,307
(laughs):
Little Lab Techs.

00:31:22,374 --> 00:31:23,375
Mm-hmm.

00:31:26,545 --> 00:31:30,082
"Sandy Baxter,
fingerprint fanatic."

00:31:30,149 --> 00:31:32,317
"Reggie Chang,

00:31:32,384 --> 00:31:35,921
eagled-eyed A/V expert."

00:31:35,988 --> 00:31:38,824
"Andrew Henries,
top-notch tox tech."

00:31:38,891 --> 00:31:42,661
"Hodgkins."

00:31:42,728 --> 00:31:43,829
Hodgkins.

00:31:43,896 --> 00:31:45,064
Mm-hmm.

00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:46,732
You named yourself
after cancer.

00:31:50,667 --> 00:31:52,101
Oh!

00:31:54,337 --> 00:31:56,906
"Mindy Bimms,

00:31:56,973 --> 00:31:58,041
"the clumsy

00:31:58,107 --> 00:32:00,777
yet buxom DNA tech."

00:32:06,149 --> 00:32:08,818
Clumsy yet buxom?

00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:12,021
It's a redeeming feature.

00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:15,925
It's-It's a prototype.

00:32:15,992 --> 00:32:18,128
So, tell me, do you think

00:32:18,194 --> 00:32:21,965
that Mindy Bimms is clumsy
because she's top-heavy?

00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:25,135
Or do you just mean clumsy

00:32:25,201 --> 00:32:26,903
like this?

00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:29,105
Oops.

00:32:32,041 --> 00:32:33,943
Okay, are you...
are you allergic

00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:35,311
to being honest with me?

00:32:35,378 --> 00:32:37,947
'Cause the thing is,
if you had actually asked me

00:32:38,014 --> 00:32:39,516
to help you with this game,

00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:40,984
I would have.

00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:43,353
But, no, you had to hide
a tape recorder under a table

00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:45,789
and engage us all
in this great big

00:32:45,855 --> 00:32:47,123
thought experiment!

00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:49,325
When in reality, it doesn't
even matter, apparently,

00:32:49,392 --> 00:32:52,462
what I think because
I'm just Mindy Big Boobs

00:32:52,529 --> 00:32:54,931
to you, and I...

00:32:54,998 --> 00:32:56,599
You are the dumbest
smart guy I know.

00:32:56,666 --> 00:32:58,401
You think I'm smart?

00:33:00,236 --> 00:33:03,640
(sighs)

00:33:09,546 --> 00:33:10,780
Night, Greg.

00:33:10,847 --> 00:33:12,849
Yeah, whatever.

00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:17,020
HODGES (high-pitched voice):
Oh, Hodges, I'm so sorry.

00:33:17,086 --> 00:33:19,055
It's just that I'm jealous
of your intellect.

00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:21,691
But Wendy, you have so much
to live for.

00:33:21,758 --> 00:33:24,360
Don't do it.
You're too close to the edge.

00:33:24,427 --> 00:33:26,663
Oh, and now I'm drowning!
Oh, God!

00:33:26,729 --> 00:33:27,831
Oh, God, help me.

00:33:27,897 --> 00:33:28,998
Help me.

00:33:30,125 --> 00:33:32,294
What are you doing?

00:33:32,361 --> 00:33:34,830
Oh, uh...

00:33:34,897 --> 00:33:37,032
(sighs)

00:33:37,099 --> 00:33:39,134
I was, uh, just trying

00:33:39,201 --> 00:33:42,938
to... develop a board game

00:33:43,005 --> 00:33:44,606
based on this place,

00:33:44,673 --> 00:33:49,444
but not in any
legally actionable sense.

00:33:49,511 --> 00:33:51,613
You get evidence,

00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,682
scenarios, analysis.

00:33:53,749 --> 00:33:57,019
Try to solve diabolical murders.

00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:11,166
I like games.

00:34:11,233 --> 00:34:12,134
Really?

00:34:12,201 --> 00:34:14,269
Yeah.

00:34:14,336 --> 00:34:18,507
Okay. Let's play.

00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:24,880
What makes it hard
to catch a killer?

00:34:24,947 --> 00:34:27,115
Is it the sheer
destructive power

00:34:27,182 --> 00:34:28,450
<i>of the murder itself</i>

00:34:28,517 --> 00:34:31,286
<i>that obliterates evidence</i>
<i>as it snuffs out life?</i>

00:34:38,694 --> 00:34:41,363
<i>Or is it the chain of events</i>
<i>the murder sets into motion</i>

00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:43,432
<i>which obscure the true crime?</i>

00:34:47,603 --> 00:34:49,571
(gasping)

00:34:49,638 --> 00:34:51,640
That was good.

00:34:52,841 --> 00:34:54,776
<i>Or is it a mechanism</i>

00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:57,779
<i>so complex and diabolical</i>
<i>that it</i>

00:34:57,846 --> 00:34:59,915
<i>borders on the incredible?</i>

00:34:59,982 --> 00:35:02,751
In truth,
it is all these things,

00:35:02,818 --> 00:35:05,487
and all these things
are the same.

00:35:06,755 --> 00:35:09,591
Because the only real way
to catch a killer,

00:35:09,658 --> 00:35:11,193
is to outsmart him.

00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:14,663
And hope that he's
not smarter than you.

00:35:16,231 --> 00:35:18,066
(gunshot, thudding)

00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:29,644
So you're rehearsing
your "speech"

00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:31,046
in front of your computer,

00:35:31,112 --> 00:35:32,625
and you take a
bullet to the head.

00:35:32,691 --> 00:35:33,792
No witnesses.

00:35:33,859 --> 00:35:35,527
Nobody heard the shot,
and the killer

00:35:35,594 --> 00:35:36,995
is somebody in the Lab.

00:35:37,062 --> 00:35:38,530
Am I eligible?

00:35:38,597 --> 00:35:40,032
In this scenario, no.

00:35:40,099 --> 00:35:42,167
Okay.

00:35:42,234 --> 00:35:44,803
So during the basic
process of the scene,

00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:46,205
what do I find?

00:35:47,973 --> 00:35:49,475
HODGES:
<i>A single nine millimeter casing</i>

00:35:49,541 --> 00:35:52,277
<i>at the doorway to Trace.</i>

00:35:55,848 --> 00:35:59,785
Then my first blush theory
is a walk-by.

00:36:02,855 --> 00:36:04,857
(shell casing clinks,
body thuds)

00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,828
I'm going to need the bullet.

00:36:09,895 --> 00:36:11,897
Then I'm going
to need an autopsy.

00:36:19,638 --> 00:36:22,941
Get it out of your system.
No sign of sexual trauma.

00:36:23,008 --> 00:36:25,511
Out! Now!

00:36:32,584 --> 00:36:35,421
All right,
trajectory of the shot

00:36:35,487 --> 00:36:38,357
was roughly 90 degrees
from vertical,

00:36:38,424 --> 00:36:42,461
straight through
his noble skull.

00:36:42,528 --> 00:36:43,629
Bullet didn't exit.

00:36:43,695 --> 00:36:44,696
GRISSOM:
<i>Is it intact?</i>

00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,502
More or less.

00:36:50,569 --> 00:36:51,804
IBIS.

00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:53,806
HODGES:
<i>The bullet's nose</i>

00:36:53,872 --> 00:36:55,874
<i>is significantly deformed</i>
<i>and the lead base is pitted.</i>

00:36:55,941 --> 00:36:59,378
<i>But there are sufficient striae</i>
<i>to get a match</i>

00:36:59,445 --> 00:37:01,447
<i>for what little it's worth.</i>

00:37:02,915 --> 00:37:05,017
(beeping)

00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:33,579
<i>The gun came through the lab</i>

00:37:33,645 --> 00:37:35,214
<i>about a week ago</i>
<i>in a buyback program,</i>

00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,050
<i>and was subsequently destroyed.</i>

00:37:38,117 --> 00:37:42,154
So you were shot by a weapon
that no longer exists.

00:37:42,221 --> 00:37:44,289
Apparently.

00:37:45,891 --> 00:37:48,827
Okay, let's go over
your snuff film, shall we?

00:37:48,894 --> 00:37:51,063
I want to see
exactly what you did.

00:37:53,899 --> 00:37:56,535
In truth,
it is all of these things,


00:37:56,602 --> 00:37:58,537
and all of these things
are the same.

00:37:58,604 --> 00:38:00,439
(rewinding)

00:38:00,506 --> 00:38:03,041
Because the only real way
to catch a killer,

00:38:03,108 --> 00:38:08,447
is to outsmart him and hope
that he is not smarter than you.

00:38:08,514 --> 00:38:10,649
(gunshot, laughter)

00:38:14,186 --> 00:38:15,387
Do it again.
Do it again.

00:38:15,454 --> 00:38:16,722
One more time.
One more time.

00:38:16,789 --> 00:38:17,990
Wait, wait, wait--
they all want to watch?

00:38:18,057 --> 00:38:20,893
Professional curiosity.

00:38:20,959 --> 00:38:22,461
I guess.

00:38:23,796 --> 00:38:25,564
(on monitor):
In truth, it is
all these things,

00:38:25,631 --> 00:38:28,767
and all these things
are the same.

00:38:28,834 --> 00:38:31,470
Because the only real way
to catch a killer,

00:38:31,537 --> 00:38:36,041
is to outsmart him and hope
that he is not smarter than you.

00:38:37,209 --> 00:38:39,378
(gunshot, body thudding)

00:38:46,218 --> 00:38:47,920
(gunshot, body thudding)

00:38:47,986 --> 00:38:50,489
GRISSOM:
<i>You took the shot straight</i>
<i>into your head,</i>

00:38:50,556 --> 00:38:52,291
<i>but according to the video,</i>

00:38:52,357 --> 00:38:54,159
<i>you were not facing</i>
<i>the hallway.</i>

00:38:54,226 --> 00:38:56,495
Which means the bullet
didn't come from there.

00:38:57,830 --> 00:38:59,498
It must've come from here.

00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:03,102
HODGES:
<i>Yes, it did.</i>

00:39:10,909 --> 00:39:13,245
A zip gun.

00:39:13,312 --> 00:39:15,948
HODGES:
<i>With an unrifled barrel.</i>

00:39:16,014 --> 00:39:18,183
And a remote trigger.

00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:20,052
What model year is the pager?

00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:21,954
<i>Pre 1990.</i>

00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:24,523
So no call-back numbers.

00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:26,658
Pre-1990 pagers
didn't store them.

00:39:26,725 --> 00:39:30,462
HODGES:
<i>So, you're at a dead end?</i>

00:39:30,529 --> 00:39:32,197
I'm just getting started.

00:39:44,877 --> 00:39:47,379
Do I have to walk over
to the GCMS

00:39:47,446 --> 00:39:48,647
or will you just tell me?

00:39:48,714 --> 00:39:50,549
<i>The barrel of the zip gun</i>
<i>contains traces</i>

00:39:50,616 --> 00:39:52,284
<i>of black powder.</i>

00:39:54,553 --> 00:39:59,324
Okay, but the bullet
was pitted on the base,

00:39:59,391 --> 00:40:02,761
which is the result of exposure
to smokeless gunpowder.

00:40:02,828 --> 00:40:05,998
Which means that the bullet
that killed you

00:40:06,065 --> 00:40:07,566
was fired twice.

00:40:08,834 --> 00:40:11,670
GRISSOM:
<i>The killer test fires the gun,</i>

00:40:11,737 --> 00:40:13,705
<i>knowing it will be destroyed,</i>

00:40:13,772 --> 00:40:15,207
<i>and keeps the bullet</i>
<i>and the casing.</i>

00:40:17,309 --> 00:40:19,078
<i>He puts the bullet</i>
<i>in a metal tube</i>

00:40:19,144 --> 00:40:21,280
<i>on a wad of black powder.</i>

00:40:21,346 --> 00:40:23,048
<i>With a pager trigger,</i>
<i>it's essentially</i>

00:40:23,115 --> 00:40:24,716
<i>a remote controlled musket.</i>

00:40:24,783 --> 00:40:26,351
<i>Call the number from any phone</i>

00:40:26,418 --> 00:40:28,387
<i>or through the internet and...</i>

00:40:28,454 --> 00:40:30,456
(explosion)

00:40:31,457 --> 00:40:33,192
Impressive.

00:40:33,258 --> 00:40:34,393
Can you tell me whodunit?

00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:37,396
Well, Bobby Dawson
is an early

00:40:37,463 --> 00:40:40,399
19th century
firearm enthusiast.

00:40:40,466 --> 00:40:42,701
He, uh, loads and fires
muskets for fun.

00:40:42,768 --> 00:40:44,436
Oh, yeah.

00:40:44,503 --> 00:40:46,438
Big gun guy.

00:40:46,505 --> 00:40:48,774
I didn't do it!

00:40:48,841 --> 00:40:50,309
I didn't do anything!

00:40:50,375 --> 00:40:51,710
I swear!

00:40:51,777 --> 00:40:53,479
Hey!

00:40:53,545 --> 00:40:54,580
Whoa.

00:40:54,646 --> 00:40:55,614
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:40:55,681 --> 00:40:56,782
(sighs)

00:40:56,849 --> 00:40:58,484
(cocks gun)

00:40:58,550 --> 00:40:59,418
Gun.

00:41:09,962 --> 00:41:11,930
What do you got
against Bobby Dawson?

00:41:11,997 --> 00:41:13,599
Nothing.

00:41:13,665 --> 00:41:15,267
Running gag.

00:41:15,334 --> 00:41:18,270
So, you think Bobby Dawson
did it?

00:41:18,337 --> 00:41:20,272
No.

00:41:20,339 --> 00:41:22,875
Bobby was framed.

00:41:22,941 --> 00:41:24,910
You drew me a map.

00:41:24,977 --> 00:41:27,413
The path
of the bullet,

00:41:27,479 --> 00:41:29,415
if not stopped
by your brain mass,

00:41:29,481 --> 00:41:31,750
would have continued straight

00:41:31,817 --> 00:41:33,585
through into
ballistics.

00:41:33,652 --> 00:41:34,920
Where Bobby works.

00:41:34,987 --> 00:41:36,922
Now, Bobby's a real gun guy,

00:41:36,989 --> 00:41:39,491
and no gun guy would ever
position himself

00:41:39,558 --> 00:41:41,827
down-range
of a shot.

00:41:43,862 --> 00:41:45,864
You're more than a victim,
Hodges.

00:41:47,633 --> 00:41:49,368
<i>According to your video,</i>

00:41:49,435 --> 00:41:51,537
<i>you straightened up just before</i>
<i>the fatal shot was fired.</i>

00:41:51,603 --> 00:41:53,539
<i>You knew it was coming.</i>

00:41:53,605 --> 00:41:55,808
<i>And you made sure that you were</i>
<i>in the perfect position</i>

00:41:55,874 --> 00:41:56,909
to catch it.

00:41:56,975 --> 00:41:58,444
I am a mere Padawan

00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:00,779
in the presence
of the Jedi Master.

00:42:00,846 --> 00:42:02,848
True.

00:42:04,583 --> 00:42:06,552
Let's play another.

00:42:06,618 --> 00:42:08,821
Sure.

00:42:12,691 --> 00:42:15,360
You weren't ready.

00:42:15,427 --> 00:42:18,163
To leave.

00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:19,665
This.

00:42:19,732 --> 00:42:20,999
The challenges,
the puzzles,

00:42:21,066 --> 00:42:23,035
the job.

00:42:23,102 --> 00:42:25,104
No.

00:42:26,138 --> 00:42:28,340
But Sara was.

00:42:30,375 --> 00:42:33,345
Yeah, she was.

00:42:33,412 --> 00:42:35,247
You can't stand in the way
of that.

00:42:37,282 --> 00:42:39,518
When it's time
for someone to move on,

00:42:39,585 --> 00:42:42,521
you just gotta let them go.

00:42:42,588 --> 00:42:45,691
Let's play the game, shall we?

00:42:45,758 --> 00:42:47,860
Okay.

00:42:47,926 --> 00:42:49,695
Oh!

00:42:49,762 --> 00:42:51,930
Mind if I record this?

00:42:53,966 --> 00:42:56,969
Scenario 12,
Hodges and Grissom.

00:42:57,970 --> 00:42:59,838
Okay, you walk
into the AV lab.

00:42:59,905 --> 00:43:01,774
You find Archie slumped
over his computer

00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,075
with a knife in his head...

00:43:03,142 --> 00:43:05,077



00:43:07,146 --> 00:43:09,148
