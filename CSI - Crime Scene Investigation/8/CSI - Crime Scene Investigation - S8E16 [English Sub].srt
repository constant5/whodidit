00:00:06,792 --> 00:00:08,625
Are you afraid
of vaginas, Spencer?


00:00:08,692 --> 00:00:11,595
No, I'm actually fine with them.


00:00:11,662 --> 00:00:12,830
Are you?
Yeah.


00:00:12,896 --> 00:00:14,331
Are you really?
Yeah.


00:00:14,398 --> 00:00:16,066
Because these jokes <i>stink</i>


00:00:16,133 --> 00:00:17,768
like someone who's
afraid of vaginas.


00:00:17,835 --> 00:00:19,102
Okay, well, if you could


00:00:19,169 --> 00:00:21,104
just point specifically
to the jokes you object to,


00:00:21,171 --> 00:00:22,873
I'll try to freshen them up.


00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:23,974
They all suck.


00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:25,042
But Annabelle...


00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:27,978
Don't argue with me.
Just make me funny.


00:00:28,045 --> 00:00:29,613
And make me loveable.
(elevator dings)


00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,882
(crowd clamoring)

00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:32,883
Annabelle!
Annabelle!

00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:33,750
Can I have
your autograph?

00:00:33,817 --> 00:00:34,785
Annabelle,
I love you.

00:00:34,852 --> 00:00:38,522
Can I have
your autograph?

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,561
So, how'd it go?

00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:47,598
Oh, great. She hates everything
and I'm afraid of vaginas.

00:00:47,664 --> 00:00:49,500
I'm only afraid
of the ones with teeth.

00:00:49,566 --> 00:00:51,535
Could one of you guys
do me a favor?

00:00:51,602 --> 00:00:53,237
If you could
take my pencil

00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:55,639
and drive it through
my eye into my brain?

00:00:55,706 --> 00:00:58,775
No, then one of us
would have to take your job.

00:00:58,842 --> 00:01:00,577
Sorry I'm late.

00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:02,679
I was fixing the script.

00:01:02,746 --> 00:01:04,448
We understand.
Thank you.

00:01:04,515 --> 00:01:06,083
WOMAN:
Picture's up.

00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,251
I need Bud.

00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:08,852
Where the hell is Bud?

00:01:08,919 --> 00:01:10,420
Take one.

00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,523
Hold the roll.

00:01:12,589 --> 00:01:14,591
ANNABELLE:
There you are.

00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:16,460
(muffled yell)

00:01:21,031 --> 00:01:22,432
I need you, Bud.

00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:24,168
I need you, too.

00:01:24,234 --> 00:01:25,769
I thought you were mad at me.

00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:27,971
Oh, you know how I am.

00:01:28,038 --> 00:01:29,339
The rewrites
are just horrible.

00:01:29,406 --> 00:01:31,708
Why doesn't anyone
support me?

00:01:31,775 --> 00:01:33,477
BUD:
I support you, doll.

00:01:33,544 --> 00:01:35,546
Don't worry about it.
I'll take care of it.

00:01:35,612 --> 00:01:37,815
Thank you, baby.

00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,055
Annabelle wants it funnier.

00:01:45,122 --> 00:01:47,391
Good note.

00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:52,563
If I need water,
I'll ask for water.

00:01:52,629 --> 00:01:54,064
You're a stand-in.

00:01:54,131 --> 00:01:58,235
Do not get in my eyeline
when I'm preparing for a scene.

00:01:58,302 --> 00:02:01,171
(with Southern accent):
So sorry.
How ever could I forget?

00:02:01,238 --> 00:02:04,007
Inbred cracker.

00:02:04,074 --> 00:02:05,342
Let's get this going.

00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:07,778
I have a 7:00 brain aneurysm.

00:02:09,012 --> 00:02:10,681
(blubbering)

00:02:10,747 --> 00:02:12,049
Action.

00:02:12,115 --> 00:02:13,083
Hit me.

00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,786
Oh, damn.

00:02:15,853 --> 00:02:17,154
What do you
want to do

00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:19,823
after we've blown through
your ex-husband's cash?

00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,593
I say we take his credit cards
and go lap dancing.

00:02:22,659 --> 00:02:24,361
(laughter)

00:02:24,428 --> 00:02:26,063
Giving or getting?

00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:28,765
Doesn't matter, as long as I get
to have a party in my pants.

00:02:28,832 --> 00:02:30,701
(laughter)

00:02:30,767 --> 00:02:32,736
And... cut.

00:02:32,803 --> 00:02:33,937
Cut it.

00:02:34,004 --> 00:02:35,739
SPENCER:
Oh, geez, here we go.

00:02:35,806 --> 00:02:37,541
Think happy thoughts.
Think happy thoughts.

00:02:39,009 --> 00:02:41,378
Why did you give Megan the joke?
Yeah, why did
she get the joke?

00:02:41,445 --> 00:02:43,247
They both have jokes.

00:02:43,313 --> 00:02:45,415
She has the big joke--
the pants joke.

00:02:45,482 --> 00:02:46,950
Yeah, the pants joke
is the killer.

00:02:47,017 --> 00:02:48,886
The pants joke suits
Megan's character.

00:02:48,952 --> 00:02:50,621
To hell with Megan's character.

00:02:50,687 --> 00:02:52,623
Is this show
called <i>Annabelle,</i>

00:02:52,689 --> 00:02:54,258
or is it <i>Stupid Lucky Cow?</i>

00:02:54,324 --> 00:02:56,794
BUD:
It's not called
<i>Stupid Lucky Cow,</i> hon.

00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,629
It's called <i>Annabelle,</i>
right, honey?

00:02:58,695 --> 00:03:00,697
Yeah. See, he gets it.

00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:03,534
That's why he is
co-executive producer.

00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,603
Seems like just yesterday
he was your driver.

00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,372
That was six
months ago.

00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,073
What's the matter
with him?
I don't know.

00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:14,645
Megan, honey, we got
to swap the lines around.

00:03:14,711 --> 00:03:16,747
Why?

00:03:20,818 --> 00:03:23,320
Fine.

00:03:23,387 --> 00:03:24,721
Picture's up.

00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:27,124
(clearing throat)
Okay.

00:03:27,191 --> 00:03:28,959
Hit me.

00:03:29,026 --> 00:03:30,260
(laughter)

00:03:30,327 --> 00:03:32,129
Damn.

00:03:32,196 --> 00:03:34,898
What do you
want to do

00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:37,301
once we blow through
my ex-husband' cash?
(laughter)

00:03:37,367 --> 00:03:40,604
I say we get his credit cards
and go lap dancing.

00:03:40,671 --> 00:03:42,639
Giving or getting?

00:03:42,706 --> 00:03:44,174
Doesn't matter to me.

00:03:44,241 --> 00:03:46,577
As long as there's
a party in my pants.

00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,912
(Bud tittering)

00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:51,114
(baby crying)

00:03:51,181 --> 00:03:52,916
Oh. (laughing)

00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:54,485
Genius.

00:03:56,954 --> 00:03:59,323
PHILLIPS:
Sorry for the delay.

00:03:59,389 --> 00:04:02,259
It's a paparazzi
jungle downstairs.

00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:05,362
Yeah, well, Doc Robbins isn't
the only one with a scrapbook.

00:04:05,429 --> 00:04:06,396
You were saying?

00:04:06,463 --> 00:04:07,731
My room is
down the hall,

00:04:07,798 --> 00:04:09,032
and I was walking past.

00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:11,001
Saw the door ajar.

00:04:11,068 --> 00:04:14,538
Went inside and found her
lying like that.

00:04:14,605 --> 00:04:15,772
So I called 911.

00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:18,342
Do you know who
was up here with her?
No idea.

00:04:18,408 --> 00:04:20,677
Almost all of the cast and crew
went back to L.A.

00:04:20,744 --> 00:04:21,678
after we wrapped,

00:04:21,745 --> 00:04:23,380
but Annabelle
won't travel

00:04:23,447 --> 00:04:25,516
at night.

00:04:25,582 --> 00:04:27,551
So she made me
stay behind.
"Made me"?

00:04:27,618 --> 00:04:29,286
I thought you were the boss.

00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:31,655
That's not how TV works.

00:04:31,722 --> 00:04:34,291
No. No, well, sure,
I created the show.

00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:37,060
When the show became a hit,
she became a star.

00:04:37,127 --> 00:04:39,830
I became a highly-paid
butt monkey.

00:04:39,897 --> 00:04:41,965
Well, it's a skill
like anything else.

00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:44,635
She wanted me to ride back
in the limo with her

00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:45,803
and give me notes

00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:48,639
on the next script,
and... you know,

00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:52,876
emasculate me
for a couple of hours.

00:04:52,943 --> 00:04:55,646
Looks like she struck her head
on the edge of this table.

00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,681
Possible struggle.

00:04:57,748 --> 00:04:59,817
When was the last time
you saw her?

00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:01,685
When we wrapped.

00:05:01,752 --> 00:05:05,289
I got really drunk.

00:05:05,355 --> 00:05:07,024
And then I threw up.

00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:08,258
Got drunk again.

00:05:08,325 --> 00:05:11,328
Went up to my room,
crawled into bed

00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:13,330
and prayed for death.

00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:16,099
Mine, not hers.

00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:18,702
PHILLIPS:
Jaw flexibility
is minimal.

00:05:18,769 --> 00:05:20,571
Just going into rigor.

00:05:20,637 --> 00:05:21,939
Puts TOD

00:05:22,005 --> 00:05:23,740
around midnight.

00:05:29,112 --> 00:05:31,748
Uh... Grissom.

00:05:48,332 --> 00:05:51,235
It's a rubber chicken.

00:05:51,301 --> 00:05:52,569
Huh.

00:05:52,636 --> 00:05:54,104
(shutter clicking)

00:05:54,171 --> 00:05:55,439
BRASS:
What are you doing?

00:05:55,506 --> 00:05:57,608
Oh, I thought it would make
a nice Christmas card.

00:05:57,674 --> 00:05:59,176
Give me that.

00:05:59,243 --> 00:06:00,644
Oh, sorry, my bad.

00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,781
Aw, come on.
You got to say something.

00:06:04,848 --> 00:06:07,551
Uh... I suspect
fowl play?

00:06:07,618 --> 00:06:09,920
Or, uh, that's poultry evidence?

00:06:09,987 --> 00:06:13,323
You know,
something.

00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:15,058
Dying is easy.

00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,427
Comedy's hard.

Some unbelievable news
from Las Vegas today.


00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,996
TV's favorite unwed mother
Annabelle Fundt


00:07:02,063 --> 00:07:03,166
star of the hit sitcom
<i>Annabelle,</i>


00:07:03,233 --> 00:07:05,535
was found dead in her hotel room
this morning.


00:07:05,602 --> 00:07:07,504
At this time, we have no details


00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:08,792
and authorities are refusing
to comment,


00:07:08,859 --> 00:07:11,695
but, of course, we'll have more
details as this story develops.


00:07:13,397 --> 00:07:15,266
There you go, Murph.


00:07:15,332 --> 00:07:18,535
I'll get it to work.


00:07:18,602 --> 00:07:19,803
Water,
sparkling water,


00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,505
juice...


00:07:21,572 --> 00:07:23,707
No booze.


00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,015
Ditto on the minibar.


00:07:31,081 --> 00:07:32,082
SPENCER:
Annabelle wasn't allowed


00:07:32,149 --> 00:07:34,118
to consume alcohol
when she works.


00:07:34,184 --> 00:07:35,452
Was there a problem?


00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,422
(paper ripping)


00:07:38,489 --> 00:07:41,158
You are all...


00:07:41,225 --> 00:07:42,860
against me!


00:07:42,927 --> 00:07:44,595
I can't take it
anymore!


00:07:44,662 --> 00:07:48,132
You are trying
to sabotage me!


00:07:48,198 --> 00:07:50,267
(grunts)


00:07:52,269 --> 00:07:54,405
Hey, kid, want to
feel my new boobs?


00:07:54,471 --> 00:07:56,173
(no audio)


00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,542
It was an insurance issue.


00:07:58,609 --> 00:08:00,110
I got it from
here, Spencer.


00:08:00,177 --> 00:08:01,712
MAN:
Grissom, this guy
just flew in


00:08:01,779 --> 00:08:03,113
from L.A.
on the studio jet.


00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,682
Name's Stewart Little.


00:08:04,748 --> 00:08:06,850
It's pronounced, "Lie-tell."


00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,988
Gil.


00:08:11,055 --> 00:08:13,691
We got a closet eater.


00:08:13,757 --> 00:08:17,094
(eating loudly)


00:08:20,898 --> 00:08:23,500
Was Annabelle bulimic?


00:08:23,567 --> 00:08:25,102
Oh, you bet she was.


00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:26,570
Spencer, there's
no need to get into...


00:08:26,637 --> 00:08:28,072
It's all right.


00:08:28,138 --> 00:08:30,474
She can't
hurt us anymore. Yeah.


00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:31,809
Yeah, she did
the two-finger dessert,


00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:34,411
but at least
the vomit


00:08:34,478 --> 00:08:36,313
seemed to take off
what the camera put on.


00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,816
It's a terrible,
terrible scourge.


00:08:38,882 --> 00:08:40,718
Gil.


00:08:40,784 --> 00:08:43,220
Found a bottle of urine
in the closet as well.


00:08:43,287 --> 00:08:45,756
Did she also
have a drug problem?


00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:48,158
Uh, define "problem."


00:08:48,225 --> 00:08:50,027
The kind that requires
using other people's urine


00:08:50,094 --> 00:08:51,262
to pass a drug test.


00:08:51,328 --> 00:08:53,430
Then, yes.


00:08:53,497 --> 00:08:54,565
(door opening)


00:08:54,632 --> 00:08:55,733
BUD:
Annabelle!


00:08:59,103 --> 00:09:01,739
Please, I just want
to kiss her good-bye.


00:09:01,805 --> 00:09:04,074
We can't let you
do that, sir.
But she's my wife!


00:09:04,141 --> 00:09:05,576
Your what?
Ah, geez.


00:09:05,643 --> 00:09:07,444
Mitch.


00:09:07,511 --> 00:09:10,247
Yeah, Annabelle and I
were married two days ago.


00:09:10,314 --> 00:09:11,849
Oh, I don't
believe that.


00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:13,751
Oh, no, it's true.
We had a deal.


00:09:13,817 --> 00:09:16,754
She said if I gave up coke,
then we could get married.


00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,088
But you never
gave up coke.


00:09:18,155 --> 00:09:19,189
She didn't know that.


00:09:19,256 --> 00:09:20,624
STEWART:
Gentlemen!


00:09:20,691 --> 00:09:22,259
The studio--
and both of you--


00:09:22,326 --> 00:09:23,460
have a substantial
investment


00:09:23,527 --> 00:09:26,430
in Annabelle's image,
so perhaps this discussion


00:09:26,497 --> 00:09:27,698
could take place
elsewhere.


00:09:27,765 --> 00:09:29,300
(beeping)


00:09:30,334 --> 00:09:32,870
Hey, Jim, you're up.


00:09:32,937 --> 00:09:35,272
BUD (mouthful):
There it is.


00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:37,641
Signed, witnessed and notarized.


00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:39,410
BRASS:
You know, it's a
tragic coincidence


00:09:39,476 --> 00:09:41,946
that she died two days
after you qualified


00:09:42,012 --> 00:09:43,714
for half of what she's worth.


00:09:43,781 --> 00:09:46,383
Really? I thought
that was the bright side.


00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:48,085
SPENCER:
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>


00:09:48,152 --> 00:09:51,255
He's a parasite.
He's a barnacle.


00:09:51,322 --> 00:09:54,558
He is the pimple on the ass
of a mediocrity.


00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:55,626
(pops lips)


00:09:55,693 --> 00:09:57,661
(exhales)


00:09:57,728 --> 00:09:59,163
She picked him up
three years ago


00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:01,065
in a comedy club
at Sioux City,


00:10:01,131 --> 00:10:03,734
hired him to be her driver,
then a writer,


00:10:03,801 --> 00:10:06,237
then a producer,


00:10:06,303 --> 00:10:08,606
but all he really did
was push his weight around,


00:10:08,672 --> 00:10:11,742
get loaded and bang extras
behind Annabelle's back.


00:10:11,809 --> 00:10:14,912
I didn't kill her. I love her!


00:10:14,979 --> 00:10:16,580
You know, when she called me


00:10:16,647 --> 00:10:18,649
to come to her room last night,
she was alive.


00:10:18,716 --> 00:10:20,017
But you were newlyweds.


00:10:20,084 --> 00:10:21,785
Why'd you sleep
in different rooms?


00:10:21,852 --> 00:10:23,988
Well, she had kind of a rule
about that.


00:10:24,054 --> 00:10:27,191
She didn't like to look at me
after we had sex.


00:10:31,729 --> 00:10:33,864
What do you know
about the chicken?


00:10:33,931 --> 00:10:36,867
She didn't like to look
at me <i>during</i> sex, either.


00:10:36,934 --> 00:10:38,202
Are you a bad boy?


00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:39,370
I'm a bad boy!


00:10:39,436 --> 00:10:40,604
Who's your mama?
You're my mama!


00:10:40,671 --> 00:10:41,705
Say it.
Mama!


00:10:41,772 --> 00:10:42,706
(laughing)


00:10:42,773 --> 00:10:44,375
All right,
now make that sound.


00:10:44,441 --> 00:10:46,443
(Bud gobbling like chicken)


00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:49,980
This is a classic comedy prop.


00:10:50,047 --> 00:10:52,850
Goes way back probably
at least to vaudeville.


00:10:52,917 --> 00:10:54,852
But you probably


00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:56,553
want to know how this ended up


00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,289
in Annabelle's
throat.


00:10:58,355 --> 00:10:59,990
I got no idea.


00:11:00,057 --> 00:11:02,693
Last time I saw it,
it was on a stage in L.A.


00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,361
Are you kidding me?

00:11:04,428 --> 00:11:08,232
You put a rubber chicken
in my show?

00:11:08,299 --> 00:11:10,134
Do I look like a prop comic?

00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,572
I am not a prop comic!

00:11:15,573 --> 00:11:16,340
Ow!

00:11:16,407 --> 00:11:18,342
That was humiliating.

00:11:18,409 --> 00:11:21,478
Yeah, you must have felt
like... like an ass.

00:11:21,545 --> 00:11:24,014
Of course we're gonna
finish the episode.

00:11:24,081 --> 00:11:26,817
Just a couple of second unit
shots to pick up on the lot.

00:11:26,884 --> 00:11:28,018
That's it.

00:11:28,085 --> 00:11:31,021
Uh-huh. Annabelle Fundt's
final performance.

00:11:31,088 --> 00:11:32,890
It's ratings gold.

00:11:32,957 --> 00:11:36,760
30 share easy unless they
throw that dancing crap at us.

00:11:39,296 --> 00:11:41,298
This way, Mr. Lietel.

00:11:52,109 --> 00:11:53,277
Sir, please.

00:11:53,344 --> 00:11:54,578
Stay with me, okay?

00:11:54,645 --> 00:11:59,183
Beautiful people doing
high-tech police work.

00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,252
There might be
a series in this.

00:12:01,318 --> 00:12:04,188
Oh. Hey, Mr. Little.

00:12:04,255 --> 00:12:05,356
have a seat.
"Lie-tell."

00:12:05,422 --> 00:12:07,358
Oh. Sorry.

00:12:07,424 --> 00:12:08,892
Okay, here we go.

00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,329
The elevator security cameras
confirm Annabelle's presence

00:12:12,396 --> 00:12:13,898
at 11:01 p.m., and

00:12:13,964 --> 00:12:16,300
according to the hotel's
key card access log,

00:12:16,367 --> 00:12:19,470
she entered her room immediately
after exiting the elevator.

00:12:19,536 --> 00:12:23,007
Now, all <i>you</i> need to do is
let us know if you recognize

00:12:23,073 --> 00:12:24,275
anybody getting off
on her floor.

00:12:24,341 --> 00:12:25,876
Okay?
Okay.

00:12:26,877 --> 00:12:28,879
That'd be Bud.

00:12:28,946 --> 00:12:30,014
SANDERS:
At 11:06.

00:12:31,882 --> 00:12:34,685
Suite was entered
at 11:07 p.m.

00:12:34,752 --> 00:12:37,888
He stayed in there
for roughly 20 minutes.

00:12:37,955 --> 00:12:39,556
That's consistent
with his statement.

00:12:39,623 --> 00:12:40,991
But that's still plenty of time

00:12:41,058 --> 00:12:43,294
to kill her.

00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,896
You know, that might be
one of our writers.

00:12:45,963 --> 00:12:47,798
What? You don't know for sure?

00:12:47,865 --> 00:12:49,700
LIETEL:
They're writers.

00:12:49,767 --> 00:12:51,268
She hires 'em and

00:12:51,335 --> 00:12:52,269
she fires 'em.

00:12:52,336 --> 00:12:53,904
Who can keep track, right?

00:12:58,475 --> 00:13:00,611
STOKES:
And there's Annabelle going out.

00:13:00,678 --> 00:13:02,780
Wait a minute.
We never saw her going down.

00:13:02,846 --> 00:13:05,616
No, no, no, that's...
Natasha Something-or-other.

00:13:05,683 --> 00:13:09,787
That's Annabelle's
assistant/stand-in, whatever.

00:13:09,853 --> 00:13:11,188
Quite a resemblance.

00:13:11,255 --> 00:13:12,856
Annabelle made her
get plastic surgery

00:13:12,923 --> 00:13:14,091
so they'd look more alike.

00:13:14,158 --> 00:13:16,327
Paid for it out
of her own pocket.

00:13:16,393 --> 00:13:17,661
That's very generous.

00:13:17,728 --> 00:13:19,196
Sure.

00:13:19,263 --> 00:13:20,998
Let's call it generosity.

00:13:21,065 --> 00:13:23,500
Well, Natasha
came back down

00:13:23,567 --> 00:13:28,138
at 11:57 p.m.,
carrying a garment bag.

00:13:28,205 --> 00:13:29,940
and that's it
until the next morning

00:13:30,007 --> 00:13:31,008
when Spencer found the body.

00:13:31,075 --> 00:13:33,210
What the heck is she doing?

00:13:33,277 --> 00:13:35,713
Going on a midnight laundry run?

00:13:38,415 --> 00:13:39,683
You're not asking me
that question.

00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:43,754
I mean... that's your
job, right? Because I...

00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:49,393
Cap'n, do we have
to do this right now?

00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,694
I'm on my way
to the airport.

00:13:50,761 --> 00:13:52,429
We have surveillance
that places you

00:13:52,496 --> 00:13:54,565
in Ms. Fundt's room
around the time of her death,

00:13:54,632 --> 00:13:55,833
leaving with a garment bag.

00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,368
Of course you did.

00:13:57,434 --> 00:13:59,136
That's one of my jobs.

00:13:59,203 --> 00:14:02,640
<i>I knocked real quiet-like,</i>
<i>and when she didn't answer,</i>

00:14:02,706 --> 00:14:06,243
<i>I let myself in, got the bag,</i>
<i>and tiptoed out of there.</i>

00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:07,645
What was in the bag?

00:14:07,711 --> 00:14:09,647
Wardrobe, silly.

00:14:09,713 --> 00:14:12,316
I had to put it on the truck
to go back to L.A.

00:14:12,383 --> 00:14:13,851
Did you see Annabelle?

00:14:13,918 --> 00:14:15,052
Cap'n.

00:14:15,119 --> 00:14:16,887
Miss Annabelle
had a firm rule.

00:14:16,954 --> 00:14:18,989
If she's asleep,
don't wake her.

00:14:19,056 --> 00:14:20,658
If she's awake,
don't talk to her

00:14:20,724 --> 00:14:22,326
till she talks
to you first.

00:14:22,393 --> 00:14:23,994
I don't know who
in their right mind

00:14:24,061 --> 00:14:25,529
want to talk to
that bitch anyway.

00:14:25,596 --> 00:14:27,998
Whoo. That's kinda harsh...

00:14:28,065 --> 00:14:29,233
coming from her assistant.

00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,669
And stand-in,
and photo double

00:14:31,735 --> 00:14:34,338
and all-around
whippin' girl.

00:14:34,405 --> 00:14:36,540
You have any idea what
that woman put me through?

00:14:36,607 --> 00:14:39,276
Tell the doctor to make yours
feel like these!

00:14:39,343 --> 00:14:41,779
See? Nice, right?

00:14:41,845 --> 00:14:43,280
Okay.

00:14:45,816 --> 00:14:50,187
Right and left breast implants.
Check... check.

00:14:50,254 --> 00:14:52,890
There are abrasions in
the upper esophagus,

00:14:52,957 --> 00:14:55,125
but no vital response
in the tissue.

00:14:55,192 --> 00:14:57,962
Then the rubber chicken
was inserted postmortem.

00:15:01,365 --> 00:15:03,767
And, thus, not
the cause of death.

00:15:03,834 --> 00:15:05,236
It might have been a gag.

00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:08,472
Sorry.

00:15:08,539 --> 00:15:10,274
Right and left
buttock implants.

00:15:10,341 --> 00:15:15,179
High and firm.
High and firm.

00:15:15,246 --> 00:15:16,614
That's right. Go ahead.

00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,483
Cheek... Cheek.

00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:22,219
COD subdural hematoma
is the result of a sharp blow

00:15:22,286 --> 00:15:23,787
to the back of the skull.

00:15:23,854 --> 00:15:26,657
If she hadn't gone quickly,
she'd would have gone slowly.

00:15:26,724 --> 00:15:28,459
There's cirrhosis of the liver,

00:15:28,525 --> 00:15:31,195
and near perforating
stomach ulcers.

00:15:34,265 --> 00:15:36,400
What's the matter, David?

00:15:37,401 --> 00:15:38,469
She's got no lady parts.

00:15:38,535 --> 00:15:40,471
She had a hysterectomy.

00:15:40,537 --> 00:15:43,073
Okay. Um...

00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,609
Then why was she
using one of these?

00:15:45,676 --> 00:15:47,077
Nostalgia?

00:15:53,751 --> 00:15:54,952
♪ Extra! Extra! ♪

00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:58,956
Just one day after
the tragic and untimely death

00:15:59,023 --> 00:16:00,958
of TV superstar Annabelle Fundt,

00:16:01,025 --> 00:16:02,960
<i>Extra</i> caught up
with some cast members,

00:16:03,027 --> 00:16:06,263
including Emmy Award-winning
costar Megan Kupowski.

00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:09,833
This is a profound tragedy.


00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,703
Annabelle had a huge
impact on all of us,


00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:17,641
and she will be deeply missed.


00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:20,311
Godspeed, Annabelle.

00:16:20,377 --> 00:16:21,979
(dog growling)

00:16:22,046 --> 00:16:23,915
Oh. You miss her, too,
don't you, Binky?

00:16:23,915 --> 00:16:26,017
Wave good-bye to Annabelle.

00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:29,988
Bye-bye.

00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:50,542
That time of
the month, huh?

00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:52,744
I know. Picking out the
right feminine product

00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:55,213
can be so hard.

00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,715
You gonna mock me
or help me?

00:16:56,781 --> 00:16:58,516
I have to choose?

00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:00,952
I can't get this to work.

00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:03,521
Well, that's probably 'cause you
don't have the right equipment.

00:17:03,588 --> 00:17:05,490
You don't, do you?

00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:07,292
Ha-ha.
Ha.

00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,827
You're lucky you're cute.

00:17:08,893 --> 00:17:12,230
Annabelle Fundt was dosing
her tampons with vodka.

00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:13,565
Does that even work?

00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:16,501
Kinda. Even at their
most absorbent,

00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:18,570
tampons only hold about
19 grams of fluid,

00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:19,834
or about 20 milliliters.

00:17:19,901 --> 00:17:21,269
Well, that's enough
for Aunt Flo,

00:17:21,336 --> 00:17:23,137
but that is not gonna get
an alcoholic drunk.

00:17:23,204 --> 00:17:24,706
Who's Aunt Flo?

00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,175
Oh. All right.

00:17:27,241 --> 00:17:29,410
Well, maybe she was just
doing it to take the edge off,

00:17:29,477 --> 00:17:31,679
but what I can't figure out
is how she managed it

00:17:31,746 --> 00:17:33,314
because every time
I throw one in here,

00:17:33,381 --> 00:17:35,149
it turns into
SpongeBob SquarePants.

00:17:35,216 --> 00:17:39,387
You don't take it out
of the applicator first.

00:17:40,822 --> 00:17:42,023
Gimme.

00:17:46,361 --> 00:17:47,295
Thanks.

00:17:47,362 --> 00:17:48,563
All right.

00:17:50,098 --> 00:17:52,166
Watch and learn.

00:17:57,505 --> 00:17:58,539
There.

00:17:58,606 --> 00:18:01,109
That's why they call it
an applicator.

00:18:03,778 --> 00:18:06,180
I always wondered
how that worked.

00:18:06,247 --> 00:18:07,181
All men do.

00:18:07,248 --> 00:18:08,216
So, if Annabelle was using

00:18:08,282 --> 00:18:09,217
vodka-soaked tampons
to get drunk,

00:18:09,283 --> 00:18:10,318
where was she
getting the booze?

00:18:10,385 --> 00:18:11,886
There was none in her suite.

00:18:11,953 --> 00:18:14,389
GRISSOM:
<i>According to Henry,</i>
<i>it was full of pure vodka.</i>

00:18:14,455 --> 00:18:16,791
Oh.
Possibly a way
of imbibing

00:18:16,858 --> 00:18:18,593
without aggravating
her ulcers.

00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,729
God, I hope she wasn't gargling
with vinegar and baking soda.

00:18:21,796 --> 00:18:22,864
Wouldn't do much for plaque.

00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:23,865
No.

00:18:23,931 --> 00:18:25,266
(shutter clicks)

00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:26,601
Hey.

00:18:26,668 --> 00:18:28,936
What does this
look like to you?

00:18:30,805 --> 00:18:32,607
Hermaphrodite
on roller skates.

00:18:32,674 --> 00:18:34,142
A puppy.

00:18:35,777 --> 00:18:37,011
(laughs):
No.

00:18:37,078 --> 00:18:40,148
Not this. This.

00:18:41,482 --> 00:18:43,818
See that?

00:18:47,021 --> 00:18:48,222
Shoe impression.

00:18:48,289 --> 00:18:51,092
WILLOWS:
Triangular ball, narrow heel.

00:18:51,159 --> 00:18:52,560
Looks like a woman's shoe.

00:18:52,627 --> 00:18:53,861
Yeah, somebody
stepped in the blood.

00:18:53,928 --> 00:18:55,163
I doubt it was the vic.

00:19:07,141 --> 00:19:09,243
We got a suspect.

00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,645
(phone ringing)

00:19:13,448 --> 00:19:16,584
Grissom.

00:19:16,651 --> 00:19:19,587
Are they willing
to hold the scene?

00:19:19,654 --> 00:19:21,322
I'll meet you at the airport.

00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:50,585
♪ ♪

00:20:25,186 --> 00:20:26,454
Pull the cover off.

00:20:26,521 --> 00:20:27,855
Sure thing, Detective.

00:20:35,448 --> 00:20:36,949
So much for movie magic.

00:20:36,949 --> 00:20:38,751
The show was trying to
finish up the episode

00:20:38,817 --> 00:20:40,085
using Annabelle's
photo double.

00:20:40,152 --> 00:20:42,021
Simple drive-by.
Second unit stuff.

00:20:42,087 --> 00:20:44,923
Car went out of control.
She wrecked.

00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:45,924
Paramedics

00:20:45,991 --> 00:20:47,993
were on the scene
in minutes.

00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,828
She was dead
when they pulled her out.

00:20:49,895 --> 00:20:53,332
GRISSOM:
She was our prime suspect
in the Annabelle Fundt case.

00:20:53,399 --> 00:20:55,334
We wanted to talk to her
when we got the call from you.

00:20:55,401 --> 00:20:56,335
You got a Ouija board?

00:20:56,402 --> 00:20:58,237
I got something better.

00:21:02,741 --> 00:21:04,677
Help!

00:21:04,743 --> 00:21:06,278
(crashing)

00:21:06,345 --> 00:21:08,614
WOMAN:
Oh, my gosh, is she okay?

00:21:08,681 --> 00:21:10,716
So who had access to the car?

00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:14,520
Well, actually, it was
Annabelle's personal car.

00:21:14,586 --> 00:21:17,623
She leased it, then made
the studio pay her a rental fee

00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:18,857
to use it on the show.

00:21:18,924 --> 00:21:20,592
A Ferrari?

00:21:20,659 --> 00:21:23,462
I thought she played
a struggling single mom.

00:21:23,529 --> 00:21:25,197
Oh, they had her
win it

00:21:25,264 --> 00:21:26,532
in a radio contest.

00:21:26,598 --> 00:21:28,968
For me, that's when the show
jumped the shark.

00:21:29,034 --> 00:21:32,671
In any event,
it was on a locked truck

00:21:32,738 --> 00:21:35,207
since before the company
left for Vegas.

00:21:35,274 --> 00:21:37,743
They were supposed to shoot
that scene in Vegas.

00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:40,212
So Annabelle was supposed
to be driving this car.

00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:41,213
Yep.

00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,381
We'll take it to Impound.

00:21:42,448 --> 00:21:43,882
The body will go
to Mission Road,

00:21:43,949 --> 00:21:45,551
and I'll let you know
what we find.

00:21:45,618 --> 00:21:47,386
Thanks.

00:21:49,521 --> 00:21:50,589
Hey, Jim.
Yeah?

00:21:50,656 --> 00:21:54,093
What does that mean,
"jumping the shark"?

00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,028
Well, remember the Fonz?

00:21:57,429 --> 00:21:58,664
The Fonz?

00:21:58,731 --> 00:22:00,833
(woman screams)

00:22:00,899 --> 00:22:05,604
Binky! No! Binky, wake up!
Wake up! (sobbing)

00:22:05,671 --> 00:22:08,407
Oh, God!
Why, God, why?

00:22:08,474 --> 00:22:11,644
Binky! Binky!

00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:13,879
(sobbing)

00:22:13,946 --> 00:22:16,682
What is happening?

00:22:16,749 --> 00:22:19,818
(sobbing)

00:22:21,253 --> 00:22:22,688
WILLOWS:
<i>I'm sorry. What's a Binky?</i>

00:22:22,755 --> 00:22:26,692
Oh, okay. How sad.

00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:28,627
L.A. crime lab found
an after-market chip

00:22:28,694 --> 00:22:31,964
inside the Ferrari's engine
control system, but no prints.

00:22:32,031 --> 00:22:34,867
Well, anyone with a laptop
who knows how to flash an EPROM

00:22:34,933 --> 00:22:36,769
can get a car
to do anything they want.

00:22:36,835 --> 00:22:39,071
Street racers do it
all the time.

00:22:39,138 --> 00:22:40,472
Chips are easy to obtain,

00:22:40,539 --> 00:22:41,974
virtually untraceable.

00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:43,676
Detective Flores
is keeping us in the loop.

00:22:43,742 --> 00:22:44,977
We're gonna do breakfast.

00:22:45,044 --> 00:22:48,113
Okay. Don't go all Hollywood
on us, all right?

00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:50,282
I'll see you soon.

00:22:50,349 --> 00:22:51,517
HODGES:
Hmm, check this out.

00:22:51,583 --> 00:22:53,419
This is Bud's wedding
from a couple days ago.

00:22:53,485 --> 00:22:55,120
They went for
the "Breath of Nature" package.

00:22:55,187 --> 00:22:56,388
WILLOWS:
And you know
this because...?

00:22:56,455 --> 00:22:57,589
She's wearing a veil.

00:22:57,656 --> 00:22:58,991
There's ivy on the trellis.

00:22:59,058 --> 00:23:00,459
That cost extra, you know?

00:23:00,526 --> 00:23:03,629
God, it's nice to know
that Annabelle was a romantic.

00:23:03,696 --> 00:23:06,665
Mm, I'm not so sure about that.

00:23:06,732 --> 00:23:08,133
Oh, and just so you know,

00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,002
I'm considering this
a working lunch,

00:23:10,069 --> 00:23:11,603
so I did not clock out.

00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:15,441
Take a gander at this.

00:23:17,676 --> 00:23:21,013
Next guy up to be married
catches this on his cell phone,

00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,182
then he sells it
'cause he realizes what he has.

00:23:23,248 --> 00:23:26,385
But he caught more
than he thought he did.

00:23:27,553 --> 00:23:28,721
(computer trilling)

00:23:28,787 --> 00:23:31,757
Annabelle didn't have
a mole on her chin.

00:23:31,824 --> 00:23:34,927
Always a stand-in,
never a bride.

00:23:34,994 --> 00:23:37,529
Bud didn't marry Annabelle.

00:23:37,596 --> 00:23:39,965
He married Natasha
pretending to be Annabelle.

00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:42,568
Well, one thing's for sure.

00:23:42,635 --> 00:23:44,670
Neither one of them's
pretending to be dead.

00:23:44,737 --> 00:23:46,271
I guess that makes Bud a liar.

00:23:46,338 --> 00:23:47,640
Then he's moving up.

00:23:54,246 --> 00:23:56,181
A few short years ago,

00:23:56,248 --> 00:23:58,417
Bud Parker was just
another Iowa barback

00:23:58,484 --> 00:24:00,386
slinging drinks in Sioux City.

00:24:00,452 --> 00:24:02,955
Annabelle Fundt
was his ticket out.

00:24:03,022 --> 00:24:05,491
It was love at first sight,
Hollywood-style.

00:24:05,557 --> 00:24:08,494
Bud climbed from the bottom rung
to the top of the heap

00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,895
in record time.

00:24:09,962 --> 00:24:12,631
Annabelle and me
were made for each other.


00:24:12,698 --> 00:24:15,701
You know, she's got my back,
and I've got hers.


00:24:15,768 --> 00:24:17,636
More, but less


00:24:17,703 --> 00:24:20,439
and funnier!

00:24:20,506 --> 00:24:24,510
We share a love
of animals, ThighMasters,

00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:29,815
long walks on the beach,
poor people, stuff.

00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:35,988
We're very spiritual,
right, Bud?

00:24:36,055 --> 00:24:37,256
Oh, yeah.

00:24:37,323 --> 00:24:39,258
Dalai Lama.

00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:43,778
BRASS:
Nice office.

00:24:43,845 --> 00:24:45,814
Yeah, thanks.

00:24:47,115 --> 00:24:48,083
Whoa! Hey,

00:24:48,149 --> 00:24:49,651
easy on the Emmy there, buddy.

00:24:49,718 --> 00:24:51,453
Is that what this is?

00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:52,620
Yeah.

00:24:59,594 --> 00:25:02,864
Whoa, don't you need
a search warrant for that?

00:25:07,335 --> 00:25:08,636
Are these yours?

00:25:08,703 --> 00:25:11,873
What was I supposed to do?

00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,308
She was a mean drunk, but she

00:25:13,375 --> 00:25:14,376
was worse
when she was sober.

00:25:14,442 --> 00:25:15,510
So you kept her
liquored up

00:25:15,577 --> 00:25:16,978
while you schtupped Natasha?

00:25:17,045 --> 00:25:18,012
What?

00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:19,314
L.A. Coroner's Office

00:25:19,381 --> 00:25:22,384
found semen
in Natasha's vaginal canal.

00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:24,486
What's the L.A. Coroner's Office
doing

00:25:24,552 --> 00:25:26,054
in Natasha's vaginal canal?

00:25:27,756 --> 00:25:30,225
Is there something
you want to tell us, Bud?

00:25:30,291 --> 00:25:32,193
All right.

00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:35,497
That's probably my,

00:25:35,563 --> 00:25:37,832
you know, in her...

00:25:37,899 --> 00:25:39,868
We know.

00:25:39,934 --> 00:25:41,302
So you faked
your wedding;

00:25:41,369 --> 00:25:43,004
you used Natasha
as a photo double;

00:25:43,071 --> 00:25:45,540
Annabelle dies;
you inherit everything she had;

00:25:45,607 --> 00:25:47,375
split it with Natasha.
Nice plan.

00:25:47,442 --> 00:25:50,278
No. No, no, no, no.
Well, yeah, that was the plan,

00:25:50,345 --> 00:25:51,813
but we didn't kill her.

00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,883
<i>When Natasha went up to her</i>
<i>room, she was already dead.</i>

00:25:54,949 --> 00:25:56,451
Damn!

00:25:56,518 --> 00:25:58,887
I was looking forward to this.

00:25:59,888 --> 00:26:01,823
(squishing)
Oops.

00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:04,626
I think Natasha found her dead
because you killed Annabelle.

00:26:04,693 --> 00:26:07,028
Then you killed the only person
who knew about the plan:

00:26:07,095 --> 00:26:08,363
Natasha.

00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:10,231
Why would I kill Natasha?

00:26:10,298 --> 00:26:11,733
Doing her
was like doing Annabelle,

00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,335
except she didn't yell at me
when I couldn't get it up.

00:26:14,402 --> 00:26:16,237
Why'd you reprogram
the computer chip

00:26:16,304 --> 00:26:17,272
in her car?

00:26:17,338 --> 00:26:20,108
There are computer chips
in cars?

00:26:20,175 --> 00:26:21,843
Look, I don't know
who you killed
or who you didn't kill,

00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:23,945
but I do know we can hold you
for conspiracy to commit.

00:26:24,012 --> 00:26:24,746
You can?

00:26:24,813 --> 00:26:25,880
You just admitted it.

00:26:25,947 --> 00:26:26,915
I did?

00:26:26,981 --> 00:26:29,184
Mike.

00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:31,052
I thought these guys
were extras.

00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:33,121
Wow. That went
really badly.

00:26:33,188 --> 00:26:34,522
So you like him for it?

00:26:34,589 --> 00:26:36,291
There's nothing about this guy
I like.

00:26:36,358 --> 00:26:38,560
But if he's smart enough
to pull off a double homicide,

00:26:38,626 --> 00:26:39,961
he deserves one of these

00:26:40,028 --> 00:26:42,030
'cause he's a better actor
than anyone on the show.

00:26:42,097 --> 00:26:45,834
SIMMS:
<i>Care to guess what was</i>
<i>on that rubber chicken?</i>

00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,635
Other than Bud's ass?

00:26:47,702 --> 00:26:49,437
I found one unknown
male contributor,

00:26:49,504 --> 00:26:51,039
but this guy's DNA
matched the urine

00:26:51,106 --> 00:26:52,474
from the water bottle
in the closet.

00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:54,476
Okay.

00:26:56,478 --> 00:26:58,546
Honey, why don't you
take ten

00:26:58,613 --> 00:27:00,215
and go get minty fresh?

00:27:00,281 --> 00:27:02,384
ANNABELLE:
I think I will.
Thanks.

00:27:04,419 --> 00:27:06,020
Okay, Greg, what do you got?

00:27:06,087 --> 00:27:08,890
Well, I was working
my way back from the
time of the murder

00:27:08,957 --> 00:27:10,392
to earlier in the day.

00:27:10,458 --> 00:27:12,293
Check this out.

00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,696
WILLOWS:
It's the writing staff?

00:27:14,763 --> 00:27:16,564
Around 7:00, four guys go up.

00:27:16,631 --> 00:27:19,567
After about a half hour,
three come down,

00:27:19,634 --> 00:27:23,138
followed a couple minutes
later by Annabelle.

00:27:23,204 --> 00:27:24,706
What happened
to the fourth rider?

00:27:24,773 --> 00:27:27,475
I think he's the one
who came down alone

00:27:27,542 --> 00:27:28,209
close to midnight.

00:27:35,316 --> 00:27:38,253
WILLOWS:
He's drinking
Titan Springs water.

00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:39,554
That's the brand bottle

00:27:39,621 --> 00:27:41,723
I found at the murder site
filled with urine.

00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:44,192
So this guy might have been
waiting for Annabelle

00:27:44,259 --> 00:27:45,660
when she came back.

00:27:52,367 --> 00:27:55,203
(man panting)

00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:56,171
(Annabelle screams)

00:27:56,237 --> 00:27:58,473
Looks like a comedy writer
came out of the closet.

00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:00,975
I doubt if it's the first time.

00:28:01,042 --> 00:28:02,677
I hear <i>Boston Legal's</i>
looking for writers.

00:28:02,744 --> 00:28:04,145
How is that a comedy?

00:28:04,212 --> 00:28:06,047
It's not. That's why
you'd be perfect for it.

00:28:06,114 --> 00:28:07,315
Hmm!
Funny.

00:28:07,382 --> 00:28:09,818
Anybody have a contact
at <i>Two And A Half Men?</i>

00:28:09,884 --> 00:28:11,519
Ugh! I'd rather sleep with
Annabelle than write that crap.

00:28:11,586 --> 00:28:13,088
Annabelle's dead.

00:28:13,154 --> 00:28:15,590
I'm saying.

00:28:15,657 --> 00:28:17,158
Can we help you?

00:28:17,225 --> 00:28:20,295
I'm gonna need to collect
a DNA sample from all of you.

00:28:20,362 --> 00:28:22,130
Doesn't sound good.

00:28:22,197 --> 00:28:24,132
BRASS:
It's really
not so bad.

00:28:24,199 --> 00:28:25,700
Now, we know that the three
of you went up

00:28:25,767 --> 00:28:27,302
to Annabelle's suite
around 7:00 P.M.

00:28:27,369 --> 00:28:28,303
the night she died.

00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:29,938
It's kind of a ritual
on the show.

00:28:30,004 --> 00:28:31,406
6:00 to 7:00 is cocktails.

00:28:31,473 --> 00:28:33,174
7:00 to 8:00
is bend over and take it.

00:28:33,241 --> 00:28:35,009
But there were four of you
in the elevator.

00:28:35,076 --> 00:28:38,213
Yeah, me, Don, Eddie,
and the new guy.

00:28:40,281 --> 00:28:42,650
Hey.

00:28:42,717 --> 00:28:45,220
I'm sorry. Who are you?

00:28:45,286 --> 00:28:46,087
Jimmy, new writer.

00:28:46,154 --> 00:28:48,690
Hey, Jimmy.
Welcome to hell.

00:28:48,757 --> 00:28:50,358
Annabelle and Bud
would hire anybody:

00:28:50,425 --> 00:28:53,361
friends, bartenders,
drug dealers.

00:28:53,428 --> 00:28:54,596
They'd last a couple weeks,

00:28:54,662 --> 00:28:56,731
suck down a few paychecks,
then disappear.

00:28:56,798 --> 00:28:59,868
So how do we find
the new guy Jimmy?

00:29:01,436 --> 00:29:05,140
Come to think of it,
uh, I haven't seen him
since Vegas.

00:29:05,206 --> 00:29:07,242
We figure he snuck
out of the hotel room

00:29:07,308 --> 00:29:08,376
while Annabelle
was reaming us out.

00:29:08,443 --> 00:29:09,778
You think he's the one
who killed her?

00:29:14,149 --> 00:29:15,917
It's kinda looking that way,
isn't it?

00:29:15,984 --> 00:29:19,754
Does that, like, make us
accessories to murder?

00:29:19,821 --> 00:29:21,022
Not likely.

00:29:21,089 --> 00:29:23,358
Aw, damn.

00:29:23,425 --> 00:29:24,893
Is it against the law
to tell people we are?

00:29:24,959 --> 00:29:26,027
Because we would really like
to do that.

00:29:26,094 --> 00:29:27,228
Yes.

00:29:37,505 --> 00:29:39,374
(computer trilling)

00:29:47,248 --> 00:29:48,717
Excuse me.
If you see that man,
call the number, please?

00:29:48,783 --> 00:29:50,552
If you see this guy,
would you call PD for me?

00:29:50,618 --> 00:29:51,886
Thank you.

00:29:51,953 --> 00:29:54,389
Sir, if you see this man,
call this number, please.

00:29:54,456 --> 00:29:57,058
(makes whirring sound)

00:29:57,125 --> 00:30:00,028
Sir, see that man,
call that number, please.

00:30:00,095 --> 00:30:01,996
(whirring)

00:30:08,737 --> 00:30:10,805
If you see this man,
call this number.

00:30:10,872 --> 00:30:12,440
(whirring)

00:30:13,842 --> 00:30:17,379
Call that number if you see
that man, miss. Thank you.

00:30:17,445 --> 00:30:20,215
Call that number
if you see that man.

00:30:20,281 --> 00:30:23,251
(whirring)

00:30:23,318 --> 00:30:25,453
Rick.

00:30:30,492 --> 00:30:32,494
Richard Langford?

00:30:35,196 --> 00:30:37,332
(whirring)

00:30:37,399 --> 00:30:39,434
You're under arrest.

00:30:41,469 --> 00:30:43,471
A mime is a terrible thing
to waste.

00:30:49,511 --> 00:30:51,479
♪ Extra! Extra! ♪

00:30:51,546 --> 00:30:53,982
One of the main suspects
in the investigation

00:30:54,049 --> 00:30:55,984
appears to be Richard Langford,

00:30:56,051 --> 00:30:58,453
an actor who, strangely enough,
played a memorable

00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,488
<i>bit part on the hit TV show.</i>


00:31:00,555 --> 00:31:02,157
All right,
good as new.


00:31:02,223 --> 00:31:03,291
Are you sure?

00:31:03,358 --> 00:31:04,526
Maybe you should
check it again.

00:31:04,592 --> 00:31:07,495
No, really, it's completely
totally fixed.

00:31:07,562 --> 00:31:09,097
Check it.
Check it.

00:31:09,164 --> 00:31:11,099
Okay.

00:31:11,166 --> 00:31:12,834
<i>But Richard Langford's</i>
<i>appearance</i>

00:31:12,901 --> 00:31:15,136
<i>on</i> The Annabelle Show 
<i>would be his last.</i>

00:31:15,203 --> 00:31:16,371
<i>For more than three years,</i>

00:31:16,438 --> 00:31:20,041
<i>the fledgling actor was off</i>
<i>the showbiz radar until now.</i>

00:31:20,108 --> 00:31:21,710
Oh, listen, man.
I can explain.


00:31:21,776 --> 00:31:22,877
Can we talk about this?!


00:31:22,944 --> 00:31:24,546
I did not...
No! Stop!


00:31:24,612 --> 00:31:25,947
Oh, God!


00:31:26,014 --> 00:31:27,782
No! I am an artist, man!


00:31:27,849 --> 00:31:29,284
I'm an artist!


00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:31,252
I was on television!


00:31:32,287 --> 00:31:34,556
They were gonna
make me a regular.

00:31:34,622 --> 00:31:35,619
You know...
the funny plumber?

00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:36,786
Hmm.

00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:37,954
So what happened?

00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:39,789
She wanted to have
sex with me.

00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:41,224
Who did?
Annabelle.

00:31:41,291 --> 00:31:43,193
Then when I told her that
I was married and couldn't,

00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,361
she had me fired.

00:31:44,427 --> 00:31:46,029
And then I couldn't
find any more work

00:31:46,096 --> 00:31:48,298
and my wife left me
and I'm living in my car

00:31:48,365 --> 00:31:50,133
which is what I wound up
trading to the dude

00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,702
that owned the robot guy
franchise on that corner.

00:31:51,768 --> 00:31:53,403
It's a franchise?

00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:55,038
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
we're all over the country.

00:31:55,105 --> 00:31:57,808
What were you doing
in Annabelle's closet, Richard?

00:31:57,874 --> 00:32:00,143
Well, I-I saw
the show was in town,

00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:02,979
and I thought that if maybe
I could talk to her

00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:05,082
that she'd give me
another chance, you know?

00:32:05,148 --> 00:32:07,684
(laughs):
I mean, what the hell?
I'm not married anymore.

00:32:07,751 --> 00:32:11,188
I'd do her
if I absolutely had to.

00:32:11,254 --> 00:32:14,558
I know you snuck up the elevator
with the writers. What then?

00:32:14,624 --> 00:32:17,060
They barely noticed I was there.

00:32:17,127 --> 00:32:19,529
What did I tell you
about this goddamn chicken, huh?

00:32:19,596 --> 00:32:21,264
I do not want a prop chicken

00:32:21,331 --> 00:32:22,299
in my show.

00:32:22,366 --> 00:32:23,767
Did you see the name
on the script?

00:32:23,834 --> 00:32:26,236
Ann-a-belle!
Annabelle,
not dumb ch...

00:32:26,303 --> 00:32:29,039
I was gonna talk to her
after the other writers left,

00:32:29,106 --> 00:32:31,541
and then she left, too,
so I just...

00:32:31,608 --> 00:32:33,210
hid in the closet.
(chuckles)

00:32:33,276 --> 00:32:35,479
Eating candy bars
and peeing in a bottle.

00:32:35,545 --> 00:32:36,813
I know that, too.

00:32:38,181 --> 00:32:41,018
What happened
when she got back?

00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:42,586
She called Bud.

00:32:42,652 --> 00:32:44,254
Are you a bad boy?

00:32:44,321 --> 00:32:46,056
I'm a bad boy!
Who's your mama?

00:32:46,123 --> 00:32:48,625
RICHARD:
<i>There's some stuff,</i>
<i>once you see it</i>

00:32:48,692 --> 00:32:50,961
Mama!
<i>you can't ever unsee it.</i>

00:32:51,028 --> 00:32:53,563
I-I-I guess he couldn't
get the job done.

00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:54,731
(chuckles)

00:32:54,798 --> 00:32:57,601
Sorry, baby. I tried.

00:32:57,667 --> 00:32:59,069
Get out.

00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:00,804
Get out, you useless
waste of skin!

00:33:00,871 --> 00:33:02,406
Get out!

00:33:02,472 --> 00:33:04,741
Good night.

00:33:04,808 --> 00:33:07,244
<i>Finally, she was alone.</i>

00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:08,779
(panting):
Annabelle...

00:33:08,845 --> 00:33:10,313
Do I know you?

00:33:11,648 --> 00:33:13,583
(unzips zipper, drops pants)

00:33:15,285 --> 00:33:16,319
(laughs)
Ah...

00:33:16,386 --> 00:33:18,355
plumber guy!

00:33:18,422 --> 00:33:20,223
(laughs)

00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:22,626
<i>The next thing I know,</i>
<i>she grabs my...</i>

00:33:22,693 --> 00:33:24,928
(loud crunch)
Oh...!

00:33:31,034 --> 00:33:33,503
It was an accident, man.
I swear to God.

00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:35,005
What about the chicken?

00:33:35,072 --> 00:33:37,140
What chicken?

00:33:37,207 --> 00:33:38,508
(chuckles)

00:33:38,575 --> 00:33:41,511
The rubber chicken
with your DNA on it, man.

00:33:41,578 --> 00:33:44,414
That chicken.

00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:48,018
Yeah, that-that was less of
an accident than the accident...

00:33:48,085 --> 00:33:49,686
was an accident.

00:33:52,689 --> 00:33:57,027
<i>I-I thought maybe</i>
<i>I could blame it on...</i>

00:33:57,094 --> 00:33:59,629
<i>on Bud or one</i>
<i>of the other writers.</i>

00:33:59,696 --> 00:34:01,798
If her death was really
an accident, Richard,

00:34:01,865 --> 00:34:03,667
why didn't you
just call the police?

00:34:03,734 --> 00:34:05,535
Oh, come on, man.
I snuck into her suite.

00:34:05,602 --> 00:34:07,404
I-I hid in her closet,
and then she dies?

00:34:07,471 --> 00:34:08,839
How's that gonna look
on my resume?

00:34:08,905 --> 00:34:11,408
Like premeditated murder.

00:34:15,512 --> 00:34:19,449
You know anybody who wants
to buy a robot guy franchise?

00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:20,650
So that's it?

00:34:20,717 --> 00:34:23,153
Robot-man-closet-stalker guy
gets his package grabbed

00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:25,322
and the TV star dies?

00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:27,324
It <i>is</i> the classic story.

00:34:27,391 --> 00:34:29,359
You wanted to see us, Doc?

00:34:29,426 --> 00:34:32,295
Yeah. I was disposing
of Annabelle's medical waste,

00:34:32,362 --> 00:34:34,164
and I noticed
something strange.

00:34:34,231 --> 00:34:38,168
With hematomas, there's almost
always some fibrous tissue,

00:34:38,235 --> 00:34:40,504
but the blood in her brain
never clotted.

00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:41,872
She <i>was</i> an alcoholic.

00:34:41,938 --> 00:34:43,840
True, but the show
required a physical

00:34:43,907 --> 00:34:45,909
every six months
for insurance purposes,

00:34:45,976 --> 00:34:47,477
so I went through
her medical records.

00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:49,913
Clotting function was normal
even at the height

00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:52,382
of her alcoholism.

00:34:52,449 --> 00:34:54,151
So no hemophilia, either.
Nope.

00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:57,954
(thick Southern accent):
What we have here is
failure to coagulate.

00:35:01,158 --> 00:35:04,895
Her blood tested positive
for hemadin with an INR of 4.0.

00:35:04,961 --> 00:35:06,263
That's slightly higher
than clinical levels.

00:35:06,329 --> 00:35:08,065
Are you sure that
there's no other reason

00:35:08,131 --> 00:35:09,900
why she might have been
taking blood thinners?

00:35:09,966 --> 00:35:12,302
Uh, she had ulcers.

00:35:12,369 --> 00:35:14,438
Blood thinner
would never be prescribed.

00:35:14,504 --> 00:35:15,772
STOKES:
Hemadin's not

00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:17,908
really a recreational drug.

00:35:17,974 --> 00:35:19,743
How'd it get into her system?

00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:22,646
I retested all the food
and drink in her suite,

00:35:22,713 --> 00:35:24,014
and there was hemadin

00:35:24,081 --> 00:35:25,749
in her vodka-filled
mouthwash bottle.

00:35:25,816 --> 00:35:27,684
So somebody <i>was</i> poisoning her.

00:35:27,751 --> 00:35:29,086
Yeah, somebody
who knew

00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:31,755
she was doing more
than swishing her mouthwash.

00:35:31,822 --> 00:35:34,524
If Annabelle hadn't have had
these high levels of hemadin

00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:36,727
in her blood,
could she still be alive?

00:35:36,793 --> 00:35:39,930
Well, her head injury
was serious.

00:35:39,996 --> 00:35:42,933
But I'd have to say
the blood thinner in her system

00:35:42,999 --> 00:35:44,768
could well
have been the difference

00:35:44,835 --> 00:35:47,537
between her living and dying.

00:35:47,604 --> 00:35:50,240
So the clot doesn't thicken,
but the plot does.

00:35:50,307 --> 00:35:51,775
Get this.

00:35:51,842 --> 00:35:53,577
L.A. Coroner's
Office called.

00:35:53,643 --> 00:35:54,911
There was hemadin

00:35:54,978 --> 00:35:56,680
in Natasha's system as well.

00:35:57,981 --> 00:36:01,184
<i>Probably from drinking</i>
<i>Bud's tainted vodka.</i>

00:36:05,389 --> 00:36:09,593
So Annabelle and Natasha
were ingesting the same poison.

00:36:09,659 --> 00:36:11,194
Other than Bud,

00:36:11,261 --> 00:36:13,630
who knew Annabelle
was drinking her mouthwash?

00:36:14,998 --> 00:36:16,767
I know who.

00:36:16,833 --> 00:36:18,402
BRASS:
Working late?

00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:23,740
No. Just saying good-bye
to a wonderful part of my past.

00:36:23,807 --> 00:36:25,342
We'd like to talk to you.

00:36:25,409 --> 00:36:26,476
Oh, of course.

00:36:26,543 --> 00:36:28,478
About what?
GRISSOM:
Hemadin,

00:36:28,545 --> 00:36:30,080
among other things.

00:36:30,147 --> 00:36:31,615
Oh, a miracle drug.

00:36:31,681 --> 00:36:33,917
It's what kept Binky alive.

00:36:33,984 --> 00:36:35,986
Well... until yesterday.

00:36:36,053 --> 00:36:38,455
It also killed
Annabelle and Natasha.

00:36:38,522 --> 00:36:39,790
Really?

00:36:39,856 --> 00:36:41,158
How odd.

00:36:41,224 --> 00:36:43,093
We checked
with your vet.

00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,629
He said you ordered
extra refills of hemadin

00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:47,030
because your dog

00:36:47,097 --> 00:36:48,498
spitting it out?

00:36:48,565 --> 00:36:52,135
Yes. Fussy, silly,
sad little Binky.

00:36:52,202 --> 00:36:54,004
Oh, I miss him so.

00:36:54,071 --> 00:36:55,338
Not Annabelle?

00:36:56,373 --> 00:36:57,874
Not so much.

00:36:57,941 --> 00:37:01,144
Take a look at
this, will you?

00:37:01,211 --> 00:37:03,346
WOMAN (on video):
Rolling. Rolling, rolling.

00:37:03,413 --> 00:37:07,517
Honey, why don't you take ten
and go get minty fresh.

00:37:07,584 --> 00:37:12,356
I think I will.
Thanks.

00:37:12,422 --> 00:37:14,691
DIRECTOR:
And action.

00:37:14,758 --> 00:37:17,260
Minty fresh.

00:37:17,327 --> 00:37:19,996
You knew about the alcohol
in Annabelle's mouthwash,

00:37:20,063 --> 00:37:21,431
and she knew
you knew about it.

00:37:21,498 --> 00:37:22,499
But what she
didn't know

00:37:22,566 --> 00:37:23,500
is that you were spiking it

00:37:23,567 --> 00:37:25,635
with your dog's blood thinners.

00:37:25,702 --> 00:37:28,338
Bravo, gentlemen.

00:37:28,405 --> 00:37:29,606
You should register that,

00:37:29,673 --> 00:37:32,275
because around here,
the walls have ears.

00:37:32,342 --> 00:37:33,910
That's going to end up
in somebody's script,

00:37:33,977 --> 00:37:35,145
and guess who won't get credit.

00:37:35,212 --> 00:37:36,513
You.

00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,215
BRASS:
Yeah, we're not done.

00:37:38,281 --> 00:37:39,616
So when Annabelle
wouldn't kick off

00:37:39,683 --> 00:37:41,351
soon enough
to suit you,

00:37:41,418 --> 00:37:43,720
you tampered with
the computer chip in her car,

00:37:43,787 --> 00:37:45,655
knowing that even
a minor accident

00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:46,990
would cause her
to bleed out and die.

00:37:47,057 --> 00:37:49,192
But the scene kept
getting pushed,

00:37:49,259 --> 00:37:51,061
and in the end,
it was Natasha, not Annabelle

00:37:51,128 --> 00:37:52,062
who was at the wheel.

00:37:52,129 --> 00:37:54,664
This is utterly fantastic.

00:37:54,731 --> 00:37:57,534
And this malevolent
second banana knows

00:37:57,601 --> 00:38:00,203
how to do this because...

00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:01,905
she's a child genius--

00:38:01,972 --> 00:38:05,742
National Honor Society,
Mensa, Yale summa cum laude,

00:38:05,809 --> 00:38:07,110
all that crap.
I didn't say that.

00:38:07,177 --> 00:38:09,112
No, I'm coloring
the character in for you.

00:38:09,179 --> 00:38:11,615
Okay, yeah, so she's a brainiac

00:38:11,681 --> 00:38:13,383
and blah, blah, blah,
but that still doesn't explain

00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:14,951
how she got
the specific expertise

00:38:15,018 --> 00:38:18,321
to program
the car's engine control chip.

00:38:18,388 --> 00:38:19,823
(sighs)

00:38:21,425 --> 00:38:23,427
Oh!

00:38:23,493 --> 00:38:24,428
I've got it.

00:38:24,494 --> 00:38:25,729
She has
a degenerate

00:38:25,796 --> 00:38:27,064
Uncle Giuseppe

00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:30,100
who works as an automotive
software engineer in Rome.

00:38:30,167 --> 00:38:31,735
She does?
You do?

00:38:31,802 --> 00:38:32,969
And he showed her how to do it

00:38:33,036 --> 00:38:35,038
in exchange
for certain unsavory favors.

00:38:35,105 --> 00:38:37,007
Oh, wait a minute.
That sounds like a, uh...

00:38:37,074 --> 00:38:38,108
what do you call it?

00:38:38,175 --> 00:38:39,409
Writers' contrivance.

00:38:39,476 --> 00:38:40,844
Yeah, yeah,
it's a bit of a reach,

00:38:40,911 --> 00:38:42,112
but you get one per episode.

00:38:42,179 --> 00:38:45,282
So they send Interpol
to arrest the guy.

00:38:45,348 --> 00:38:46,550
How did they know
how to find him?

00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:48,352
Could you please not get
bogged down in details?

00:38:48,418 --> 00:38:49,419
Anyway,

00:38:49,486 --> 00:38:51,722
so they're escorting the guy
in handcuffs

00:38:51,788 --> 00:38:53,924
onto the plane at da Vinci
International Airport,

00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:56,159
and, and... kaboom!

00:38:57,561 --> 00:38:59,196
He's killed
in a terrorist attack

00:38:59,262 --> 00:39:01,131
by Basque separatists.

00:39:01,198 --> 00:39:02,733
Shouldn't Basque
separatists be in Spain?

00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:03,734
Oh, it's great.

00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,769
It's got everything you'd want:

00:39:05,836 --> 00:39:08,004
narrative propulsion,
memorable characters,

00:39:08,071 --> 00:39:10,741
a felicitous intertwining of
the random and the deliberate.

00:39:10,807 --> 00:39:11,975
Just one question.

00:39:12,042 --> 00:39:14,277
What's that?
What's her motivation?

00:39:14,344 --> 00:39:18,648
Maybe she was tired of all the
constant abuse and humiliation.

00:39:18,715 --> 00:39:21,318
GRISSOM:
Yeah, she's not
getting any younger.

00:39:21,385 --> 00:39:24,287
She knows how Hollywood deals
with aging actresses.

00:39:24,354 --> 00:39:26,623
BRASS:
Yeah, she knows time
is not on her side.

00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:27,791
She figures
she'll bump off the bitch

00:39:27,858 --> 00:39:30,327
and move herself up
to number one.

00:39:30,394 --> 00:39:33,697
You're very good,
but you've still got a problem.

00:39:33,764 --> 00:39:34,698
What's that?

00:39:34,765 --> 00:39:36,700
No hard evidence.

00:39:36,767 --> 00:39:39,803
No fingerprints, no hairs
you can stick in a machine

00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:41,638
that spits out
the kind of truth

00:39:41,705 --> 00:39:44,174
juries lap up
like a saucer of warm milk.

00:39:44,241 --> 00:39:47,511
How do you know we're not saving
the best for the last act?

00:39:47,577 --> 00:39:49,446
Are you?

00:39:49,513 --> 00:39:51,815
Because if you've got it,
bring it on.

00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:56,520
Just as I thought.

00:39:56,586 --> 00:39:59,189
Bubkes.

00:39:59,256 --> 00:40:01,992
So you figure,
"What the hell? Give it a shot."

00:40:02,059 --> 00:40:04,027
You cook up this weak gruel

00:40:04,094 --> 00:40:07,364
of spindly circumstances
and wild conjecture

00:40:07,431 --> 00:40:10,434
just to see if you can rattle
Banana 2.0's cage,

00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,335
just to see what she gives up,

00:40:12,402 --> 00:40:13,804
but she's way too cool

00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:16,306
and in the end
reveals nothing.

00:40:16,373 --> 00:40:20,377
She simply smiles and says,

00:40:20,444 --> 00:40:23,246
"Gentlemen, if you'll excuse me,

00:40:23,313 --> 00:40:26,850
I have a 13-episode commitment
from CBS to attend to."

00:40:27,884 --> 00:40:30,487
It's called <i>Megan's Family.</i>

00:40:30,554 --> 00:40:31,488
And with that,

00:40:31,555 --> 00:40:33,490
she and her lover-

00:40:33,557 --> 00:40:38,495
slash-executive producer turn
and make their grand exit.

00:40:39,496 --> 00:40:40,897
Hey.

00:40:42,332 --> 00:40:43,266
We'll be watching you.

00:40:43,333 --> 00:40:46,636
Mondays-- 9:30,
8:30 Central.

00:40:52,676 --> 00:40:55,278
Forget it, Gil.

00:40:55,345 --> 00:40:57,848
It's Burbank.

00:41:10,193 --> 00:41:12,129
(grunts)

00:41:12,195 --> 00:41:13,730
Uh, whoa, oh.

00:41:13,797 --> 00:41:15,198
Oh.

00:41:15,265 --> 00:41:16,466
Ooh, whoa.

00:41:16,533 --> 00:41:18,435
Whoa, ugh.

00:41:18,502 --> 00:41:20,037
Ugh.

00:41:20,103 --> 00:41:22,305
<i>Ugh, that looks bad.</i>


00:41:22,372 --> 00:41:24,141



00:41:26,109 --> 00:41:28,745
