00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:10,718
(screams)


00:00:12,553 --> 00:00:14,522
(hacking)


00:00:14,589 --> 00:00:16,791

00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:24,943
MAN:
Cut!

00:00:25,009 --> 00:00:26,344
Cut! Damn it!

00:00:26,411 --> 00:00:27,000
(bell ringing)

00:00:27,066 --> 00:00:28,968
Can somebody please
get her a glass of water?!

00:00:29,035 --> 00:00:31,104
What happened? Babe?
(coughing continues)

00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,606
What are you doing? Are
you choking on the blood?

00:00:33,673 --> 00:00:35,108
I did what you
told me to.

00:00:35,174 --> 00:00:37,777
Yeah, but this time, get it
on her face, not in her mouth.

00:00:37,844 --> 00:00:39,212
The mouth is part
of the face.

00:00:39,279 --> 00:00:40,413
Yeah, I know, I know.

00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,282
But hit her from
the side, from the side.

00:00:42,348 --> 00:00:43,583
And get plenty on the rack.

00:00:45,318 --> 00:00:46,986
We're dying here.

00:00:47,053 --> 00:00:48,454
I'm going to go ring it.

00:00:48,521 --> 00:00:50,356
All right. Hey,
grab me a bear claw.

00:00:50,423 --> 00:00:51,924
How long have I known you, huh?

00:00:51,991 --> 00:00:52,959
This is you and me.

00:00:53,026 --> 00:00:54,327
Get the shot--
not too tight.

00:00:54,394 --> 00:00:56,462
Wide enough to fit
in the fun bags.

00:00:56,529 --> 00:00:57,830
Baby-cakes...

00:00:57,897 --> 00:00:59,999
Where was I?
Want me to laugh?

00:01:00,066 --> 00:01:01,834
Don't laugh.
You were scary. Get away.

00:01:01,901 --> 00:01:04,370
Honey, this time, don't
inhale the blood, okay?

00:01:04,437 --> 00:01:06,639
All right, let's
get her cleaned up.

00:01:06,706 --> 00:01:09,042
Let's shoot this bitch.
Oh...

00:01:09,108 --> 00:01:11,444
Not you, baby. The shot.
The shot's a bitch.

00:01:11,511 --> 00:01:12,645
I love one-ers.

00:01:12,712 --> 00:01:14,714
And you know what else I love?
I love sushi.

00:01:14,781 --> 00:01:16,582
Me, too.
Do you want to go for sushi?

00:01:16,649 --> 00:01:17,951
MAN:
Our lead actress,
Weatherly Adams,

00:01:18,017 --> 00:01:19,953
had her dressing room
violated last night.

00:01:20,019 --> 00:01:22,121
BRASS:
So she's the one you
suspect is missing?

00:01:22,188 --> 00:01:23,990
She missed her call
this morning.

00:01:24,057 --> 00:01:25,558
The woman is nothing
if not professional.

00:01:25,625 --> 00:01:28,394
She's predictably precisely
35 minutes late every day.

00:01:28,461 --> 00:01:30,163
You could set
your watch to it.

00:01:30,229 --> 00:01:32,598
She's already... three hours
late and still no sign.

00:01:32,665 --> 00:01:33,733
Okay.

00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,034
(loud popping)

00:01:35,101 --> 00:01:36,469
Nothing to worry
about, gentlemen.

00:01:36,536 --> 00:01:37,804
It's just a bad bulb.

00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:41,307
If you will, please,
follow me.

00:01:47,547 --> 00:01:49,549
Here we are.

00:01:52,218 --> 00:01:54,887
Check out the flowers
in the vase.

00:01:54,954 --> 00:01:58,324
"Congratulations
on your last film."

00:01:58,391 --> 00:02:02,895
Any idea who sent her these,
Mr. Vespucci?

00:02:02,962 --> 00:02:04,564
Stalkers, creeps,

00:02:04,631 --> 00:02:06,332
cranks, nut balls, degenerates--

00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,334
we get them
all here.

00:02:08,401 --> 00:02:10,570
Weatherly attracts
them like flies.

00:02:10,637 --> 00:02:12,338
These are, uh,

00:02:12,405 --> 00:02:14,273
some of the guys we've had
trouble with in the past.

00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,975
I'll take that.

00:02:16,042 --> 00:02:18,611
When was the last
time you saw her?

00:02:18,678 --> 00:02:19,846
At wrap yesterday.

00:02:19,912 --> 00:02:22,115
We shot all night, finished
about 4:00 in the morning.

00:02:22,181 --> 00:02:24,150
Did anyone see her
leave the building?

00:02:24,217 --> 00:02:27,053
Her car's still
parked out back.

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,521
This hers?
Yeah.

00:02:28,588 --> 00:02:30,423
(recording):
Hi, it's Weatherly.

00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:32,959
Leave a message or I'll scream.
(giggles)

00:02:33,026 --> 00:02:34,761
Wallet, keys, and cell phone
still in there.

00:02:34,827 --> 00:02:35,995
Still no answer
on her home phone.

00:02:36,062 --> 00:02:38,331
I'll send a patrol car
to her house.

00:02:38,398 --> 00:02:41,334
You said there was a break in,
why don't you show me?

00:02:41,401 --> 00:02:45,204
VESPUCCI:
Ah, Weatherly...

00:02:45,271 --> 00:02:49,542
how has she died for us,
let me count the ways.

00:02:49,609 --> 00:02:54,714
Bludgeoned, boiled, filleted,

00:02:54,781 --> 00:02:57,951
defenestrated,
decapitated,

00:02:58,017 --> 00:02:59,986
disemboweled,

00:03:00,053 --> 00:03:02,555
oh, yeah, and strangled
with her own intestines.

00:03:02,622 --> 00:03:06,125
Autopsied while
still alive.

00:03:06,192 --> 00:03:07,894
Made to eat her own liver,

00:03:07,961 --> 00:03:10,129
fed slowly through
a tree chipper,

00:03:10,196 --> 00:03:13,533
roasted and served on
a bed of Belgian endive.

00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:18,037
When Weatherly Adams dies,
it's money in the bank.

00:03:18,104 --> 00:03:20,573
Here you are, gentlemen.

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,843
Looks like somebody
broke the glass,

00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,179
reached in, unlocked it

00:03:26,245 --> 00:03:27,580
and opened it.

00:03:27,647 --> 00:03:29,282
Yeah, that's the way
I found it

00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:31,751
when I got here
this evening.

00:03:49,402 --> 00:03:52,839
Uh, Jim...

00:03:52,905 --> 00:03:57,310
I got her.

00:04:01,014 --> 00:04:04,617
And I believe she's died
for the last time.

00:04:06,452 --> 00:04:10,023



00:04:10,089 --> 00:04:13,226

Whoever stuck her
under this poster


00:04:43,691 --> 00:04:45,208
was trying to send
a twisted message.


00:04:45,274 --> 00:04:47,376
Either that, or the killer's
got a wicked sense of humor.


00:04:47,443 --> 00:04:50,980
(camera shutter clicks)


00:04:51,047 --> 00:04:57,019
Lividity is fixed along
the anterior aspect, and...


00:04:57,086 --> 00:04:59,322
she is still
in full rigor.


00:04:59,388 --> 00:05:03,025
She was last seen alive
about 15 hours ago.


00:05:03,092 --> 00:05:05,194
No panties.


00:05:05,261 --> 00:05:07,730
I'll do an S.A.E. kit.


00:05:09,165 --> 00:05:10,700
(inflecting):
"The horror."


00:05:12,468 --> 00:05:13,669
(exaggerating):
The horror...


00:05:13,736 --> 00:05:15,838
Huh?


00:05:15,905 --> 00:05:17,607
Bra-Brando?


00:05:17,673 --> 00:05:19,609
Brando from
<i>Apocalypse Now?</i>


00:05:19,675 --> 00:05:21,577
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I know, Dave.


00:05:21,644 --> 00:05:22,845
Everybody knows that.


00:05:22,912 --> 00:05:27,083
Oh.
I'll get the gurney.


00:05:31,821 --> 00:05:35,224
WILLOWS:
Looks like the lady lost a heel.


00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:37,793
There's a whole lot
of something here,


00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,896
but it doesn't really
look like blood to me.


00:05:39,962 --> 00:05:43,099
No, it's, uh,
it's the wrong color.


00:05:43,165 --> 00:05:45,868
It's too red.


00:05:45,935 --> 00:05:48,271
Smells sweet.


00:05:48,337 --> 00:05:52,708
Karo syrup and food
coloring-- it's prop blood.


00:05:52,775 --> 00:05:54,744
And I am not seeing any prints.


00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,746
It's been wiped clean.


00:05:56,812 --> 00:05:58,981
The question is, where does
the fake blood end


00:05:59,048 --> 00:06:01,450
and the real blood begin?


00:06:01,517 --> 00:06:03,953

00:06:05,488 --> 00:06:06,756

as a shock to most of you,


00:06:10,359 --> 00:06:12,929
and I'm sorry
for your loss.


00:06:12,995 --> 00:06:15,565
I understand that Weatherly
Adams was a long-time member


00:06:15,631 --> 00:06:18,334
of this company...
Well, do you
have a suspect?


00:06:18,401 --> 00:06:21,938
Uh, sir, we just found
the body about an hour ago.


00:06:22,004 --> 00:06:24,140
We're just beginning
our investigation.


00:06:24,207 --> 00:06:25,975
Yeah, I get it, I get it.
I mean, it could be anyone.


00:06:26,042 --> 00:06:28,244
BRASS: Now, I'm going
to have to look at your IDs


00:06:28,311 --> 00:06:30,446
and I'm going
to take statements


00:06:30,513 --> 00:06:32,682
and fingerprints
from all of you.


00:06:32,748 --> 00:06:34,183
And I thank you in advance
for your cooperation.

Anything we can do to help.


00:06:36,352 --> 00:06:39,288
So what am I supposed
to do today?
Edit.


00:06:39,355 --> 00:06:41,057
VESPUCCI:
Excuse me, Mr. Brass.


00:06:41,123 --> 00:06:43,559
Do you think that it
would be all right


00:06:43,626 --> 00:06:45,428
if we were to...
continue to shoot...


00:06:45,494 --> 00:06:46,963
No.


00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:49,265
I want that little twerp Zarco
found and locked up.


00:06:49,332 --> 00:06:50,600
Uh, who are you?


00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:52,101
Vincent Lafoon.
This is my brother Mason.


00:06:52,168 --> 00:06:53,102
We own this place.


00:06:53,169 --> 00:06:54,203
Who's Zarco?


00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:56,072
Oliver Zarco.
He used to work here.


00:06:56,138 --> 00:06:57,707
He had a thing for Weatherly,


00:06:57,773 --> 00:07:01,777
and then he got hurt, blamed it
on us, went a little nuts.


00:07:01,844 --> 00:07:02,945
He was the one who got...


00:07:03,012 --> 00:07:04,881
He was the one who sent
the flowers and the note.


00:07:04,947 --> 00:07:06,682
So he's done this before.


00:07:06,749 --> 00:07:08,651
Yeah, like, three times.
Would you shut it?


00:07:08,718 --> 00:07:10,987
Three times. He's your guy.


00:07:11,053 --> 00:07:13,689
Do you have video
surveillance by any chance?


00:07:13,756 --> 00:07:15,057
Yeah, only on the exterior,


00:07:15,124 --> 00:07:16,626
but the video system's
been on the fritz lately.


00:07:16,692 --> 00:07:18,961
I had it repaired three days
ago-- I'll get the tapes.


00:07:19,028 --> 00:07:20,229
Oh, good.


00:07:20,296 --> 00:07:23,833

and Weatherly Adams.

00:09:52,915 --> 00:09:56,185
ZARCO:
It was the happiest time
in my life.

00:09:56,252 --> 00:09:58,154
I had realized my dream.

00:09:58,221 --> 00:10:00,556
<i>I was working in the movies.</i>

00:10:00,623 --> 00:10:03,960
<i>Though I was only in</i>
<i>an entry-level position,</i>

00:10:04,026 --> 00:10:05,862
<i>Weatherly and I were</i>
<i>already an item.</i>

00:10:05,928 --> 00:10:07,496
<i>Just like...</i>

00:10:07,563 --> 00:10:10,867
Julia Roberts
and what's his name.

00:10:10,933 --> 00:10:13,236
(indistinct cast
and crew chatter)

00:10:13,302 --> 00:10:15,705
<i>We were in love.</i>

00:10:18,608 --> 00:10:22,912
<i>And then it was</i>
<i>all over in an instant.</i>

00:10:22,979 --> 00:10:24,213
(screams)

00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,982
Oh, God!
(screams)

00:10:26,048 --> 00:10:28,851
(screaming):
Oh, my God!

00:10:28,918 --> 00:10:33,122
I was in rehab for six months.

00:10:33,189 --> 00:10:35,324
That slime ball Lafoon
convinced me

00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:37,960
not to file
a Worker's Compensation claim.

00:10:38,027 --> 00:10:40,029
He said that
he'd take care of me.

00:10:40,096 --> 00:10:41,531
And you trusted him?

00:10:41,597 --> 00:10:45,501
Yes. And then, when the deadline
passed to file my claim,

00:10:45,568 --> 00:10:47,503
Vincent offered me two grand,

00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:51,374
take it or leave it,
and then he fired my ass.

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,844
And I could have lived
with that, but...

00:10:54,911 --> 00:10:56,812
But what?

00:10:58,948 --> 00:11:01,250
Weatherly...

00:11:01,317 --> 00:11:03,252
dumped me.

00:11:03,319 --> 00:11:06,556
She felt we
were no longer

00:11:06,622 --> 00:11:07,823
compatible.

00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:12,562
The truth was, she couldn't
stand to look at me.

00:11:12,628 --> 00:11:14,397
She cried when she told me.

00:11:14,463 --> 00:11:17,233
Actresses
can do that.

00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:21,704
The smell of her skin...

00:11:21,771 --> 00:11:25,641
like fresh lemon poppy seed
scones baking in the oven.

00:11:27,376 --> 00:11:29,378
Gold flecks that
danced like Valkyries

00:11:29,445 --> 00:11:32,148
in the emerald
depths of her eyes.

00:11:32,215 --> 00:11:33,883
Her hair-- oh, God...

00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:35,418
Her hair...

00:11:35,484 --> 00:11:37,320
So you started stalking her.

00:11:38,588 --> 00:11:40,623
I brought her gifts
from time to time,

00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:43,025
to let her know
that I still loved her.

00:11:43,092 --> 00:11:44,293
Is that against the law?

00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,395
It is if you break in to do it.

00:11:46,462 --> 00:11:48,264
They wouldn't let me
in the front door.

00:11:48,331 --> 00:11:50,266
So you came in
through the window.

00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,568
Only this time,
you got caught.

00:11:52,635 --> 00:11:55,338
You argued. She told you where
to shove your flowers,

00:11:55,404 --> 00:11:56,772
and you thought to yourself,

00:11:56,839 --> 00:11:59,775
"You know, do I really need this
aggravation?"

00:11:59,842 --> 00:12:01,077
So you killed the bitch.

00:12:01,143 --> 00:12:04,480
I think <i>you</i> killed the bitch.

00:12:04,547 --> 00:12:05,581
Why would I kill her?

00:12:05,648 --> 00:12:07,250
How should I know?
Do I know you?

00:12:07,316 --> 00:12:10,086
Listen, Zarco,
you whack job,
you'd better focus!

00:12:10,152 --> 00:12:11,888
You focus.
I'm trying to explain to you.

00:12:11,954 --> 00:12:13,990
I haven't been near that place
in over a year.

00:12:14,056 --> 00:12:15,458
You got the wrong guy.

00:12:15,525 --> 00:12:17,593
I don't do that anymore.
I'm in therapy now.

00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,161
Lots of therapy.

00:12:19,228 --> 00:12:23,132
Freudian, Jungian, Gestaltian--
all that crap.

00:12:23,199 --> 00:12:26,068
I've let go of my anger.

00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:29,105
Have you seen
Catherine around?

00:12:29,171 --> 00:12:30,206
No, why?

00:12:30,273 --> 00:12:31,541
'Cause I just got
the DNA results

00:12:31,607 --> 00:12:34,076
for Weatherly Adams, and
the skin under her nails

00:12:34,143 --> 00:12:36,779
and the semen from her
S.A.E., they both belong

00:12:36,846 --> 00:12:38,714
to Vaughn Krunty.
Who?

00:12:38,781 --> 00:12:40,383
Vaughn Krunty,
aka "Zack Putrid."

00:12:40,449 --> 00:12:42,618
Who's that?

00:12:42,685 --> 00:12:44,620
The Titan of Terror,
the Sultan of Slash.

00:12:44,687 --> 00:12:46,088
He's the movie director.

00:12:46,155 --> 00:12:48,324
I just... I found him in CODIS
for a statutory rape charge

00:12:48,391 --> 00:12:49,659
in Laughlin when he was 18

00:12:49,725 --> 00:12:51,661
and the girl was 16.
Can you believe that?

00:12:51,727 --> 00:12:53,162
What's the matter
with you?

00:12:53,229 --> 00:12:55,164
Nothing.

00:12:55,231 --> 00:12:58,568
Go tell Catherine what you
found, make sure that you pull

00:12:58,634 --> 00:13:01,337
all the old evidence out of
storage in case she needs it.

00:13:01,404 --> 00:13:03,339
Okay.

00:13:06,242 --> 00:13:13,649
(screaming)

00:13:13,716 --> 00:13:15,718
(scoffs)
Please.

00:13:15,785 --> 00:13:18,387
That looks pretty
stupid, doesn't it?

00:13:18,454 --> 00:13:21,390
Well, you could cut out earlier,
maybe go to

00:13:21,457 --> 00:13:23,726
a wide exterior shot, you
could carry the scream over

00:13:23,793 --> 00:13:25,995
a big flock of birds taking off.

00:13:26,062 --> 00:13:27,663
Yeah?

00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:30,132
Or... yeah...

00:13:30,199 --> 00:13:32,101
Or not.
Or not, just...

00:13:32,168 --> 00:13:35,571
Bad idea.
All right, okay.

00:13:35,638 --> 00:13:37,106
(Putrid chuckles)

00:13:37,173 --> 00:13:39,242
Detective Brass.

00:13:39,308 --> 00:13:41,244
(chuckling):
Man, I love that.

00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:42,945
Detective Brass.

00:13:43,012 --> 00:13:45,181
You're a detective,
and your name is Brass.

00:13:45,248 --> 00:13:46,515
I can use that.

00:13:46,582 --> 00:13:49,151
That's like a cop
named Officer Copper.

00:13:49,218 --> 00:13:52,555
Or a tin horn sheriff named
Sheriff Tin.

00:13:52,622 --> 00:13:55,091
You cannot write
that stuff.
Listen, buddy...

00:13:55,157 --> 00:13:57,126
Dude, I know
why you're here, okay?

00:13:57,193 --> 00:13:59,095
Weatherly and I, yes,
we were knocking boots, man.

00:13:59,161 --> 00:14:01,531
So, you acknowledge
having sex with her?

00:14:01,597 --> 00:14:04,200
Well, yeah, I just
said I had sex...

00:14:04,267 --> 00:14:05,434
Why would I deny it?

00:14:05,501 --> 00:14:08,004
Hey, I bang all
my stars.

00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:09,906
It builds trust.

00:14:09,972 --> 00:14:12,141
It's part of my process.

00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:14,277
We found traces of your skin
under her fingernails.

00:14:14,343 --> 00:14:17,113
Maybe she wasn't into your
"process," so you raped her.

00:14:17,179 --> 00:14:19,715
(chuckles)

00:14:19,782 --> 00:14:21,717
You find that funny?

00:14:21,784 --> 00:14:23,152
Dude, you gotta see this.

00:14:23,219 --> 00:14:24,620
You're gonna love it.
Bring up Double D.

00:14:24,687 --> 00:14:25,688
Yeah.

00:14:26,322 --> 00:14:27,557
Here goes.

00:14:27,623 --> 00:14:30,426
Hi, baby. Hi.
(man laughing)

00:14:30,493 --> 00:14:32,061
PUTRID:
Check it out.

00:14:32,128 --> 00:14:34,230
Money. Money.

00:14:34,297 --> 00:14:36,599
Oh, yeah.

00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:37,733
You're a star.

00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,502
I can't believe this is my life.

00:14:39,569 --> 00:14:41,204
Oh, man, oh, man...

00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:44,140
Come over here, baby.

00:14:44,207 --> 00:14:45,141
(sighs)
Okay.


00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:48,344
(both sighing and moaning)

00:14:48,411 --> 00:14:50,513
This what you do all day?

00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:53,282
Does that look like a woman
being taken against her will?

00:14:53,349 --> 00:14:54,450
That still doesn't explain

00:14:54,517 --> 00:14:56,519
how your skin got under
her fingernails.

00:14:56,586 --> 00:14:59,021
Weatherly was...

00:14:59,088 --> 00:15:00,656
how can I put this
delicately?

00:15:00,723 --> 00:15:02,758
She was an ass-scratcher, man.

00:15:02,825 --> 00:15:05,862
She liked to
scratch my ass.

00:15:05,928 --> 00:15:09,999
She wasn't pushing me away, man,
she was pulling me in.

00:15:10,066 --> 00:15:12,134
Brass, look at my ass.

00:15:12,201 --> 00:15:13,870
Freaking claw marks.

00:15:13,936 --> 00:15:17,139
Are you trying to make me
throw up, Mr. Putrid?

00:15:17,206 --> 00:15:19,375
(purrs)

00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:29,585
(device beeping)

00:15:36,425 --> 00:15:38,628
(beeping continues)

00:15:49,906 --> 00:15:51,207
(panting)

00:15:56,479 --> 00:15:57,680
(motor revs)

00:15:57,747 --> 00:15:59,282
(screams)

00:16:03,085 --> 00:16:04,520
(screams)

00:16:10,626 --> 00:16:11,727
(laughing):
Oh, my God.

00:16:11,794 --> 00:16:14,230
How awesome.

00:16:14,297 --> 00:16:16,832
That is so cool.
I can't believe you worked

00:16:16,899 --> 00:16:18,167
for Repulsion Pictures.

00:16:18,234 --> 00:16:20,703
Well, I did it on a whim.
I was supposed to be an extra,

00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:23,739
but then they liked me, so they
gave me this whole featured bit.

00:16:23,806 --> 00:16:25,775
I got 600 bucks
for that. What?

00:16:25,841 --> 00:16:27,009
What?
I was fresh out of college.

00:16:27,076 --> 00:16:28,211
I really needed the money.

00:16:28,277 --> 00:16:30,646
I don't get it--
what's the thrill here?

00:16:30,713 --> 00:16:32,281
It's always hot babes
with huge breasts

00:16:32,348 --> 00:16:34,050
falling out of their
shirts, getting hacked up...

00:16:34,116 --> 00:16:38,221
I don't have huge breasts.
Mine are kind of... medium.

00:16:38,287 --> 00:16:39,922
But perfect...

00:16:40,857 --> 00:16:43,693
...ly adequate.

00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,061
Better, in fact.

00:16:45,127 --> 00:16:46,662
Okay.

00:16:46,729 --> 00:16:48,030
Uh, I'm out of here.

00:16:48,097 --> 00:16:49,832
Hey, let's watch it again.

00:16:51,467 --> 00:16:53,836
ROBBINS:
When I removed the axe,
I noticed that the dermis

00:16:53,903 --> 00:16:57,373
along the margin of the wound
showed no vital response,

00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,041
except in a small area

00:16:59,108 --> 00:17:02,345
on both sides of the center
of the track.

00:17:02,411 --> 00:17:04,513
The cause of death
was perforation

00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:06,883
of the liver,
spleen, and pancreas.

00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:09,952
But the injuries
are inconsistent

00:17:10,019 --> 00:17:11,754
with the position
of the axe wound.

00:17:11,821 --> 00:17:13,055
The axe isn't what killed her.

00:17:13,122 --> 00:17:16,392
Exactly. The perforation
was caused

00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:18,961
by a sharp, hollow,
cylindrical object

00:17:19,028 --> 00:17:20,463
entering through
the lower back,

00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:22,932
and then passing upwards
into the organs.

00:17:22,999 --> 00:17:25,768
Like a spear,
or a pipe of some kind?

00:17:25,835 --> 00:17:27,336
Perhaps.

00:17:27,403 --> 00:17:30,206
If the axe was planted
in her back postmortem

00:17:30,273 --> 00:17:32,842
to conceal the original
puncture site, then...

00:17:32,909 --> 00:17:34,510
we don't have a murder weapon.

00:17:34,577 --> 00:17:39,081
JOHNSON:
The only thing I found on the
surveillance tapes was this.

00:17:39,148 --> 00:17:41,784
That guy looks familiar.

00:17:43,185 --> 00:17:45,421
Oh, that's Vincent Lafoon.

00:17:45,488 --> 00:17:46,956
He and his brother
own the place.

00:17:47,023 --> 00:17:50,359
Well, here's
where it gets a little weird.

00:17:50,426 --> 00:17:51,928
(beeps)

00:17:51,994 --> 00:17:54,931
He's trying to make it
look like somebody broke in.

00:17:54,997 --> 00:17:57,533
I think he's framing Zarco.

00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,001
If he owns the place,

00:17:59,068 --> 00:18:00,436
he must have known about
the surveillance cameras.

00:18:00,503 --> 00:18:04,307
Right? Why would he let
himself get caught on tape?

00:18:04,373 --> 00:18:05,841
I don't know,
but according

00:18:05,908 --> 00:18:08,144
to Brass' notes, he thought
the system was down.

00:18:08,211 --> 00:18:10,813
So, we found
no physical evidence

00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,115
linking Zarco to the scene.

00:18:13,182 --> 00:18:15,818
Vincent knew
he had an easy fall guy.

00:18:15,885 --> 00:18:17,553
He's been playing us
the whole time.

00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:21,457
(whirring, beeping)

00:18:21,524 --> 00:18:25,528
Hey, you're making a big
mistake; you got the wrong dude.

00:18:25,595 --> 00:18:27,375
Yeah, a lot of guys
tell me that.

00:18:27,442 --> 00:18:30,679
But I didn't do anything.
Why would I kill Weatherly?

00:18:30,745 --> 00:18:32,814
She was my company's best asset.
Plus, I liked her.

00:18:39,854 --> 00:18:42,323

killed her for real?

00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:44,926

00:18:44,993 --> 00:18:46,861

out for a nice dinner.

You're letting him go?

00:18:47,929 --> 00:18:48,625

getting set up here, me!

Don't let him go-- I'm telling
you-- you'll regret this.

00:18:54,597 --> 00:18:56,032
I never touched her.
You know it,

00:18:56,099 --> 00:18:57,534

00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,803

you a big one.

00:19:27,998 --> 00:19:31,301
You know, in the slasher movies,
when they go after

00:19:31,368 --> 00:19:34,004
the dark-haired girl,
she always dies?

00:19:34,071 --> 00:19:39,543
Yeah. And the blond
always lives.

00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:43,814
Aren't you glad it
wasn't a movie?

00:19:43,881 --> 00:19:46,917
(giggles)

00:19:49,052 --> 00:19:52,689
I think, um...

00:19:52,756 --> 00:19:57,027
I think I am sick of having my
face shoved in death every day.

00:19:57,094 --> 00:20:01,064
The murder rate has
gone up every year
since I've been here.

00:20:01,131 --> 00:20:05,068
It's totally
out of control, and...

00:20:05,135 --> 00:20:09,072
we're not even
slowing them down.

00:20:09,139 --> 00:20:11,875
After examining the crime scene,
I determined there were between

00:20:11,942 --> 00:20:14,411
200 and 300 milliliters--
that's less than a cup--

00:20:14,478 --> 00:20:17,314
of Weatherly's actual
blood outside of her body.

00:20:17,381 --> 00:20:20,551
Originally, we had
assumed that the axe
blade had sealed the wound,

00:20:20,617 --> 00:20:23,287
that the position of
her body had caused her
to bleed internally.

00:20:23,353 --> 00:20:25,822
But if she had been gored first
by another weapon

00:20:25,889 --> 00:20:28,091
and then axed, there would have
been a lot more blood.

00:20:28,158 --> 00:20:30,627
Right, right. So, I compared
the initial coroner's report

00:20:30,694 --> 00:20:32,863
with the last entry
in her weight loss journal--

00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:35,933
which was taken no more than
an hour or two before her death.

00:20:35,999 --> 00:20:36,934
And guess what?

00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,969
Her body came up light?

00:20:39,036 --> 00:20:40,671
Six pounds light.

00:20:40,737 --> 00:20:42,539
That's six pints of blood

00:20:42,606 --> 00:20:45,542
at a pound each nowhere
in or around the body.

00:20:45,609 --> 00:20:47,611
She was moved.

00:20:50,848 --> 00:20:52,349

00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:54,685
The trace from the
puncture wound came back.

00:20:54,751 --> 00:20:57,754
It's zinc, which is electrically
coated onto steel

00:20:57,821 --> 00:21:01,258
to make galvanized pipe.

00:21:01,325 --> 00:21:04,695
Well, we should go back,
expand the search perimeter,

00:21:04,761 --> 00:21:06,296

00:32:13,033 --> 00:32:14,401
and then dragged over.

00:32:14,468 --> 00:32:16,136
BRASS:
We've got a warrant out
for Mason Lafoon.

00:32:16,203 --> 00:32:17,304
We're looking for him now.

00:32:17,371 --> 00:32:18,672
Okay. let me know
what you find out.

00:32:18,739 --> 00:32:19,740
(call waiting beeps)

00:32:21,709 --> 00:32:23,477
(sighs)

00:32:23,544 --> 00:32:24,812
(phone beeps)

00:32:24,878 --> 00:32:26,146
What do you want?

00:32:26,213 --> 00:32:28,615
DICKIE:
Pookie, it's me, Dickie.
I know.

00:32:28,682 --> 00:32:31,151
I've got information I think
you might be interested in.

00:32:31,218 --> 00:32:32,486
Okay, shoot.

00:32:32,553 --> 00:32:34,154
No. It has to be in person.

00:32:34,221 --> 00:32:35,823
Where are you?

00:32:35,889 --> 00:32:37,491
I'm at the studio.

00:32:37,558 --> 00:32:40,160
I thought there was no phone
transmission from there.

00:32:40,227 --> 00:32:41,662
There wasn't.
Now there is.

00:32:41,729 --> 00:32:43,664
That's how it is with phones
and electrical storms.

00:32:43,731 --> 00:32:44,999
Look, it's urgent.

00:32:45,065 --> 00:32:46,467
Get here as soon as you can.

00:32:46,533 --> 00:32:47,835
I just came from there.

00:32:47,901 --> 00:32:50,504
Why didn't you tell me then,
you annoying little man?

00:32:50,571 --> 00:32:53,007
The situation is evolving.

00:32:53,073 --> 00:32:54,842
If you're screwing with me,

00:32:54,908 --> 00:32:57,244
I will to string you up
and beat you senseless.

00:32:57,311 --> 00:32:59,079
I look forward to it.

00:32:59,146 --> 00:33:01,815
Just hurry.

00:33:03,984 --> 00:33:05,519
BRASS:
That's you, Mason.

00:33:05,586 --> 00:33:07,721
All six feet, three inches
of you

00:33:07,788 --> 00:33:09,390
impersonating your brother,

00:33:09,456 --> 00:33:11,558
which makes you good
for Weatherly's murder.

00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:13,327
You did that one,
too, didn't you?
No, no, no.

00:33:13,394 --> 00:33:14,828
Nobody killed
Weatherly, okay?

00:33:14,895 --> 00:33:16,163
She killed herself.
Oh, really?

00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,498
What, she axed herself
in the back?

00:33:17,564 --> 00:33:18,666
No, you don't understand.

00:33:18,732 --> 00:33:20,601
She... she...
It was an accident.

00:33:20,668 --> 00:33:21,769
She tripped.

00:33:21,835 --> 00:33:23,370
Good night, Weatherly.

00:33:23,437 --> 00:33:24,772
Good night, kid.
Yeah, great stuff tonight.

00:33:24,838 --> 00:33:25,839
Have a good night.
See you tomorrow.

00:33:25,906 --> 00:33:27,675
See you tomorrow. Okay.

00:33:27,741 --> 00:33:28,909
Whoa, ah!

00:33:28,976 --> 00:33:30,811
(shrieks)
(body thuds)

00:33:36,116 --> 00:33:37,351
Call 911!

00:33:37,418 --> 00:33:38,452
Call 911!

00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:39,653
Wait, let's
think about this.

00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,921
No, but Stanley...
Mason, she's dead!

00:33:40,988 --> 00:33:42,356
This time she's
not coming back.

00:33:42,423 --> 00:33:44,525
We've got so many health
and safety violations.

00:33:44,591 --> 00:33:46,694
If we report one more
set-related accident--

00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,095
especially one
resulting in a death--

00:33:48,162 --> 00:33:50,531
we will lose our bond,
our liability insurance,

00:33:50,597 --> 00:33:51,865
OSHA will shut us down,

00:33:51,932 --> 00:33:53,701
we'll get our asses sued
for wrongful death,

00:33:53,767 --> 00:33:55,703
and that will be the end
of Repulsion Pictures!

00:33:55,769 --> 00:33:56,804
Is that what
you want?

00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:58,138
Is that
what you want?!

00:33:58,205 --> 00:33:59,540
No!

00:33:59,606 --> 00:34:02,543
He... he said
"the show must go on,"

00:34:02,609 --> 00:34:05,112
th-that Weatherly...
would have wanted it that...

00:34:05,179 --> 00:34:06,280
I don't...

00:34:06,347 --> 00:34:08,048
We... we didn't kill anybody.

00:34:08,115 --> 00:34:09,450
But you made it
look like a murder,

00:34:09,516 --> 00:34:10,884
and then you framed
your brother.

00:34:10,951 --> 00:34:14,254
Well, he's been treating me
like crap my entire life.

00:34:14,321 --> 00:34:16,056
(chuckles)

00:34:16,123 --> 00:34:18,592
Yeah, but for that,
you're going to send him

00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:20,661
to jail for the rest
of his life?

00:34:20,728 --> 00:34:23,564
This was all...
this was all Stanley's idea.

00:34:23,631 --> 00:34:25,332
Do you realize
how much trouble you're in?

00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:29,970
Look, Stanley was the one who
wanted to frame Vincent, okay?

00:34:30,037 --> 00:34:32,239
All I was supposed
to do was clean up

00:34:32,306 --> 00:34:34,642
the accident scene
and pretend to be Vince

00:34:34,708 --> 00:34:36,443
and buy the roses
and that was it.

00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:37,645
The rest was him.

00:34:37,711 --> 00:34:40,014
If you don't believe me,
talk to the dwarf.

00:34:43,183 --> 00:34:45,853
Why? What did he have
to do with it?

00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:47,655
Dickie saw the whole thing.

00:34:47,721 --> 00:34:50,224
...and that will be
the end of Repulsion Pictures.

00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:51,392
Is that
what you want?

00:34:51,458 --> 00:34:53,761
Is that what
you want?!
No!

00:34:53,827 --> 00:34:56,930
MASON:
<i>And he's been trying to shake</i>
<i>down Stanley ever since.</i>

00:34:56,997 --> 00:34:59,800
Well, that would explain
the animosity.

00:35:04,538 --> 00:35:06,040
(thunder cracks)

00:35:07,241 --> 00:35:10,210
(thunder rumbling)

00:35:23,357 --> 00:35:24,858
(gasps)

00:35:30,731 --> 00:35:32,733
(thunder cracks)

00:35:41,508 --> 00:35:43,844
(thunder rumbling)

00:35:47,815 --> 00:35:52,619
Control, this is C-13 Willows,
trying to contact C-147 Lake.

00:35:52,686 --> 00:35:55,723
DISPATCH:
C-13, Control. Copy.
Stand by.

00:35:55,789 --> 00:35:57,424
(thundering)

00:35:57,491 --> 00:35:59,827
Hello, Dispatch?

00:36:02,129 --> 00:36:04,398
Hello?

00:36:04,465 --> 00:36:08,569
DISPATCH:
C-13, Control.
C-147 is not responding.

00:36:08,636 --> 00:36:11,939
Okay, thanks. Over and out.

00:36:12,006 --> 00:36:13,340
(three rapid beeps)

00:36:15,009 --> 00:36:17,011
(two gunshots)

00:36:30,024 --> 00:36:32,026
(phone ringing)

00:36:33,494 --> 00:36:34,728
(ringing continues)

00:36:36,697 --> 00:36:37,698
(ringing stops)

00:36:54,048 --> 00:36:55,049
(rings)

00:36:56,183 --> 00:36:57,951
(gasping)

00:36:58,018 --> 00:36:59,019
(whispering):
Catherine,

00:36:59,086 --> 00:37:00,254
it's Ronnie.

00:37:00,321 --> 00:37:02,089
I'm stuck
at Repulsion Pictures.

00:37:02,156 --> 00:37:03,424
I need backup.

00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:06,593
Ronnie... uh,
I'm, I'm coming.

00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:09,630
Just... just stay
on the line.

00:37:09,697 --> 00:37:11,365
Ronnie?

00:37:11,432 --> 00:37:12,700
(line clicks and goes dead)

00:37:12,766 --> 00:37:14,702
Ronnie!

00:37:14,768 --> 00:37:16,036
Hello?

00:37:16,103 --> 00:37:17,104
(three rapid beeps)

00:37:18,605 --> 00:37:20,541
Dispatch, this
is C-13 Willows

00:37:20,607 --> 00:37:23,010
requesting backup to meet
me at Repulsion Pictures.

00:37:24,678 --> 00:37:27,448
(siren wailing)

00:37:32,553 --> 00:37:34,722
(thunder cracks)

00:37:51,705 --> 00:37:53,540
(screams)

00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:56,052
You gotta help me.

00:37:56,118 --> 00:37:57,686
I'm shot!
I'm shot!

00:37:57,753 --> 00:37:59,588
You gotta get us out of here.

00:37:59,655 --> 00:38:01,190
It's gonna be okay.
Keep your voice down.

00:38:01,257 --> 00:38:02,625
(gasping)

00:38:02,691 --> 00:38:05,194
Do you know how many people
I've killed in this place?

00:38:05,261 --> 00:38:06,629
Shh!

00:38:06,695 --> 00:38:08,097
The irony is exquisite,

00:38:08,164 --> 00:38:10,966
but the pain is more formidable,
you know?

00:38:11,033 --> 00:38:14,103
I think the pain is preventing
me from enjoying the irony.

00:38:14,603 --> 00:38:15,604
Shh!

00:38:15,671 --> 00:38:16,872
(softly):
Shut up!

00:38:16,939 --> 00:38:18,541
But I...

00:38:18,607 --> 00:38:19,875
For the love
of God,

00:38:19,942 --> 00:38:21,711
stop talking.

00:38:21,777 --> 00:38:24,113
(siren wailing)

00:38:29,819 --> 00:38:31,721
(weakly):
Oh, that's not good.

00:38:31,787 --> 00:38:32,722
(coughs)

00:38:32,788 --> 00:38:34,223
I should really
stop talking

00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:36,325
and-and try and relax.

00:38:36,392 --> 00:38:38,260
That's good.
Yeah, stop talking.

00:38:38,327 --> 00:38:39,595
But I can't stop talking.

00:38:39,662 --> 00:38:41,597
I've got that
thing that...

00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:43,132
It's a syndrome.

00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:44,800
It's a word...
There's a word for it.

00:38:44,867 --> 00:38:45,835
Shh-shh-shh!

00:38:45,901 --> 00:38:47,570
People have it. It's a syndrome.

00:38:47,636 --> 00:38:48,904
I can't stop talking.

00:38:48,971 --> 00:38:50,606
STANLEY:
Zack.

00:38:54,877 --> 00:38:56,746
(whimpering)

00:38:56,812 --> 00:38:58,280
Stanley...

00:38:58,347 --> 00:39:00,116
Stanley, don't shoot me again.

00:39:00,182 --> 00:39:01,617
I don't want
to die, okay?

00:39:01,684 --> 00:39:03,352
You already
shot me twice.

00:39:03,419 --> 00:39:05,855
I learned my lesson, okay?

00:39:05,921 --> 00:39:07,256
Sir,

00:39:07,323 --> 00:39:08,791
I'm a CSI.

00:39:08,858 --> 00:39:10,426
Think about what you're doing.

00:39:10,493 --> 00:39:12,428
(thundering)

00:39:12,495 --> 00:39:13,863
Put down your weapon.

00:39:13,929 --> 00:39:16,899
I'm sorry, I don't think
I can do that.

00:39:16,966 --> 00:39:19,001
(gun cocks, Putrid sobbing)

00:39:31,847 --> 00:39:33,315
(gasps)

00:39:39,188 --> 00:39:41,590
Are you okay?

00:39:43,626 --> 00:39:44,960
Yeah.

00:39:45,027 --> 00:39:46,695
(Zack weeping)

00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:03,212
I really loved her.

00:40:06,582 --> 00:40:08,284
(thunder rumbling)

00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:16,792
(sighs)

00:40:22,598 --> 00:40:24,633
(thunder cracks)

00:40:29,458 --> 00:40:32,661
ZACK:
<i>I'm editing late,</i>
<i>like I always do,</i>

00:40:32,728 --> 00:40:34,263
<i>and I hear a shot.</i>

00:40:37,066 --> 00:40:39,335
<i>So, I go outside</i>
<i>and check it out.</i>

00:40:39,401 --> 00:40:41,003
(crank clicking)

00:40:47,376 --> 00:40:49,311
Stanley!

00:40:49,378 --> 00:40:51,347
You gotta help me
hide the dwarf

00:40:51,413 --> 00:40:52,748
before the cops
come back.

00:40:52,815 --> 00:40:55,017
Dickie was blackmailing us
about Weatherly's accident.

00:40:55,084 --> 00:40:56,552
He wants to bring
the whole company down.

00:40:56,619 --> 00:40:58,153
But you killed him!

00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,588
You killed Dickie!

00:40:59,655 --> 00:41:00,923
What's it gonna be, Zack?

00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:02,358
You gonna help me here or what?!

00:41:02,424 --> 00:41:04,527
Next thing you know,
I'm running for my life.

00:41:04,593 --> 00:41:06,462
And the nut job is chasing me.

00:41:06,529 --> 00:41:09,331
He shoots me,
and then I see the hot...

00:41:09,398 --> 00:41:11,534
you.

00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,302
And all I can think
the whole time is,

00:41:13,369 --> 00:41:14,904
"Man, this is great.

00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:17,273
I could use this stuff."

00:41:17,339 --> 00:41:20,976
I mean, this is life
imitating art imitating life.

00:41:21,043 --> 00:41:22,711
You are so beautiful.

00:41:22,778 --> 00:41:25,915
You are... Your, your
face is so expressive.

00:41:25,981 --> 00:41:27,683
It-it emotes.

00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:29,385
You do terror so good.

00:41:29,451 --> 00:41:31,520
I wasn't acting.
I know.

00:41:31,587 --> 00:41:32,521
I'll see you.

00:41:32,588 --> 00:41:34,023
Well, hey, listen.

00:41:34,089 --> 00:41:37,226
If you ever get tired of
fighting crime, you know,

00:41:37,293 --> 00:41:39,528
there's always a future for
you in the horror business.

00:41:39,595 --> 00:41:41,864
I mean, I'll
take you there.

00:41:41,931 --> 00:41:43,532
Thanks, but I like
what I'm doing.

00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:45,701
Oh, hey,
the offer's still good.

00:41:45,768 --> 00:41:46,969
Okay, thanks.

00:41:47,036 --> 00:41:48,204
No, I'm serious.

00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:49,839
I could build an entire
franchise around you.

00:41:49,905 --> 00:41:50,840
Bye.

00:41:50,906 --> 00:41:52,074
Seriously.
Give me a call.

00:41:52,141 --> 00:41:55,244
(man screams, maniacal laughter)

00:41:55,311 --> 00:41:56,779
(woman screams)

00:41:56,846 --> 00:41:59,114
(horror movie climax music
playing)

00:41:59,181 --> 00:42:01,116
(maniacal laughter)

00:42:01,183 --> 00:42:04,119
(woman screaming)

00:42:04,186 --> 00:42:06,121
(horror movie climax music
grows louder)

00:42:06,188 --> 00:42:08,858
(door hinges creaking)

00:42:10,192 --> 00:42:12,394
(screaming and maniacal
laughter grow louder)

00:42:12,461 --> 00:42:14,430
That is impressive.

00:42:14,497 --> 00:42:16,465
As the woman's throat
is being slashed,

00:42:16,532 --> 00:42:20,069
you can actually see the entire
transverse view of the trachea.

00:42:20,135 --> 00:42:21,737
That's all you've got to say?

00:42:21,804 --> 00:42:24,473
I believe I can see
the epiglottis.

00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:26,141
Epiglottis?

00:42:26,208 --> 00:42:27,476
What about the pathos?

00:42:27,543 --> 00:42:29,812
I mean...
what about the humanity?

00:42:29,879 --> 00:42:33,282
This may be Weatherly's
finest performance.

00:42:33,349 --> 00:42:35,818
Oh, just watch
the movie.

00:42:35,885 --> 00:42:38,821



00:42:41,891 --> 00:42:44,894
