About six hours.

Why haven't these bodies
been released?

00:03:09,134 --> 00:03:11,069
Good question.

00:03:11,136 --> 00:03:13,572
David was in Henderson
on another call,

00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:15,707
so, when Greg and I got here,

00:03:15,774 --> 00:03:19,077
we just started processing
the house.

00:03:19,144 --> 00:03:20,979
Found the victim
in the bathroom,
covered with a towel.

00:03:21,046 --> 00:03:23,916
We got a plastic print
on the bathroom door.

00:03:23,982 --> 00:03:26,752
It's the strongest piece of
evidence-- I photographed it

00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:28,687
and transmitted the image
back to the lab;

00:03:28,754 --> 00:03:31,457
Mandy got a hit
to an unknown palm;

00:03:31,523 --> 00:03:33,492
case info was in ViCAP.

And then,
Dispatch called,

00:03:35,627 --> 00:03:38,330
telling me
to stop processing immediately,

00:03:38,397 --> 00:03:40,232
by order of the FBI.

00:03:40,299 --> 00:03:42,901
The FBI field office
is right next to the Strip.

00:03:42,968 --> 00:03:44,169
What's taking them so long?

00:03:44,236 --> 00:03:45,704
Oh, beats the hell out of me.

Jim Brass.

00:04:16,001 --> 00:04:17,269
I'm based in New York,

00:04:17,336 --> 00:04:19,838
but I was testifying
in a case in San Francisco.

00:04:19,905 --> 00:04:21,740
When I heard about
the ViCAP hit,

00:04:21,807 --> 00:04:23,876
I got here
as fast as I could.

00:04:23,942 --> 00:04:25,811
Chopper from the Strip?
That's nice.

00:04:25,878 --> 00:04:27,913
That's my tax dollars
at work?

00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,282
You get a positive ID
on the boy?

00:04:30,349 --> 00:04:33,452
No, but we have an
ID on the female--
name is Carmen Davis.

00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:34,787
According to neighbors,
she lives alone.

00:04:34,853 --> 00:04:35,854
Apparently no kids
of her own.

00:04:35,921 --> 00:04:37,055
But if I find
anything out,

00:04:37,122 --> 00:04:39,191
I'll let you know.
Thank you. You're up.

00:04:43,429 --> 00:04:44,897
You-- you get enough photos?

00:04:44,963 --> 00:04:46,565
Definitely.

00:04:46,632 --> 00:04:48,467
Roll the body over.

00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,148
What's going on?

00:05:05,651 --> 00:05:07,953
Jack Malone, FBI,
New York City.

00:05:09,288 --> 00:05:10,756
This boy was kidnapped

00:05:10,823 --> 00:05:13,625
from his babysitter's
apartment six years ago.

00:05:13,692 --> 00:05:15,160
Babysitter was killed.

00:05:15,227 --> 00:05:18,030
The only evidence at the crime
scene was a bloody palm print.

00:05:18,097 --> 00:05:19,665
Well, there may be
a resemblance,

00:05:19,731 --> 00:05:21,700
but kids change a lot
in six years.

00:05:21,767 --> 00:05:23,602

Mm-hmm.

GRISSOM:
DNA will tell us
if this is your kid.

00:05:26,505 --> 00:05:29,208

your killer came to Vegas.

Based on lividity and rigor,

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,202
TOD-- roughly 24 hours ago.

00:06:06,269 --> 00:06:09,739
And he's got perimortem bruising
on the back of the neck.

00:06:09,806 --> 00:06:11,942
And a single sharp-force
injury to the forehead.

00:06:17,747 --> 00:06:19,849
Looks like he hit his head
on the table.

00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:21,384
Or somebody slammed it
against the table.

00:06:21,451 --> 00:06:22,686
Well, we don't know <i>that</i> yet.

00:06:25,191 --> 00:06:26,108
Agent Malone,
why don't I fill you in

00:06:26,108 --> 00:06:29,259
on what else
we do know.

00:06:29,326 --> 00:06:32,062
There are no signs anywhere that
the boy actually lived here.

00:06:32,128 --> 00:06:34,197
The sleeping bag
on the couch indicates

00:06:34,264 --> 00:06:35,665
that he was probably
a house guest.

00:06:35,732 --> 00:06:38,935
Why don't you follow me
into the kitchen.

00:06:39,002 --> 00:06:41,438
Let me know when you're ready
to transport the body.

00:06:41,504 --> 00:06:43,139
PHILLIPS:
Yes, sir.

00:07:02,425 --> 00:07:04,561
WILLOWS:
Bring us up to speed, Greg.

00:07:04,628 --> 00:07:06,930
Okay, sure. Um...

00:07:06,997 --> 00:07:09,366
Carmen Davis's keys
were still in her purse;

00:07:09,432 --> 00:07:11,134
the car's outside.

00:07:11,201 --> 00:07:13,236
No cash in the wallet, and the
credit cards have been removed

00:07:13,303 --> 00:07:16,072
and neatly stacked on the table;
it appears as though

00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:17,140
they've been wiped clean.

00:07:17,207 --> 00:07:18,308
The killer was smart enough

00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:21,645
not to take anything
that could be traced.

00:07:21,711 --> 00:07:23,914
Which suggests that
he was an experienced criminal.

00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:26,416
What do you know
about this guy?

00:07:26,483 --> 00:07:28,451
Including everything
you just told me?

00:07:28,518 --> 00:07:30,820
Everything you just told me.

00:07:30,887 --> 00:07:34,557
Six years ago, the killer took
the murder weapon with him.

00:07:34,624 --> 00:07:38,128
It was a baseball bat that
he found in the apartment.

00:07:38,194 --> 00:07:40,630
Well, this time,
we think it's a hammer.

00:07:42,332 --> 00:07:47,070
The round indentation wounds are
consistent with hammer blows.

00:07:47,137 --> 00:07:49,272
Do you see any similarities
between this victim

00:07:49,339 --> 00:07:51,441
and the babysitter
who was killed six years ago?

00:07:51,508 --> 00:07:53,643
Just that they were both
bludgeoned to death.

00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:56,613
The babysitter was a lot older,
and she wasn't covered.

00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,082
Covering a body usually
indicates remorse

00:07:59,149 --> 00:08:00,517
on the part of the killer.

00:08:00,584 --> 00:08:02,552
So you think he felt remorseful
about this victim

00:08:02,619 --> 00:08:04,321
and not the one
from six years ago?

00:08:04,387 --> 00:08:06,089
Maybe he knew Carmen Davis.

00:08:06,156 --> 00:08:08,358
There's three toothbrushes,

00:08:08,425 --> 00:08:11,962
two of them in travel cases.

00:08:12,028 --> 00:08:13,496
My guess:

00:08:13,563 --> 00:08:15,832
the killer was staying here
with the little boy.

00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:18,034
There was no sign
of forced entry.

00:08:18,101 --> 00:08:19,636
PHILLIPS:
Agent Malone?

00:08:19,703 --> 00:08:21,204
We're ready
to take the boy out.

00:08:21,271 --> 00:08:22,872
Okay.

00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:25,308
(sighing):
So, I assume

00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:27,978
we'll be sending over
the case evidence to Quantico?

00:08:28,044 --> 00:08:29,246
We can't process the evidence

00:08:29,312 --> 00:08:30,747
from every case
we're involved in.

00:08:30,814 --> 00:08:32,949
We have a massive
overload already.

00:08:33,016 --> 00:08:34,818
This will be
joint jurisdiction.

00:08:34,884 --> 00:08:38,154
You do your thing,
I'll do mine.

00:08:41,057 --> 00:08:43,226
(siren wails in distance)

00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:49,566
COD is multiple
blunt-force trauma.

00:08:49,633 --> 00:08:51,434
Based on the development
of the contusions,

00:08:51,501 --> 00:08:55,205
it appears the blow
to the back of the skull

00:08:55,272 --> 00:08:57,207
was the first impact,

00:08:57,274 --> 00:09:00,110
but the ones on the face
came about half-hour later.

00:09:00,176 --> 00:09:01,411
Half an hour?
Yeah.

00:09:01,478 --> 00:09:02,612
Was she raped?

00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:03,613
Yeah.

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,782
I, uh, did a wet mount,

00:09:05,849 --> 00:09:07,884
found semen
in the vaginal vault,

00:09:07,951 --> 00:09:10,220
and I collected an SAE kit.

00:09:10,287 --> 00:09:13,523
This guy is some piece of work.

00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:16,459
I'll get it to DNA.

00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:37,560
No birthmarks.

00:09:37,627 --> 00:09:40,330
Our missing boy didn't
have any, either.

00:09:40,397 --> 00:09:42,098
So the only way to
confirm the identity...

00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:45,769
I've had the original DNA report
electronically sent to your lab.

00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:49,185
Well, then you'll just have
to wait for your answer.

00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,250
You know, maybe now
would be a good time

00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,853
for you to brief us
on the original case.

00:09:58,022 --> 00:09:59,291
JACK:
<i>His name was Jason Taylor.</i>

00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:01,060
(glass breaking)
<i>He was at his babysitter's</i>
<i>apartment.</i>

00:10:01,917 --> 00:10:03,518
<i>He'd been home sick</i>
<i>from school.</i>

00:10:03,585 --> 00:10:06,521
<i>That's when it happened.</i>

00:10:12,394 --> 00:10:13,795
(camera shutter clicking)

00:10:16,131 --> 00:10:18,400
<i>An unidentified male entered,</i>

00:10:18,466 --> 00:10:20,635
<i>most likely through an open</i>
<i>window on the fire escape,</i>

00:10:20,702 --> 00:10:23,939
<i>murdered the babysitter</i>
<i>and took Jason with him.</i>

00:10:28,343 --> 00:10:32,013
We never got a decent
description of the perp.

00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,482
Nothing was stolen?

00:10:33,548 --> 00:10:35,851
Cash was still in
the babysitter's purse;

00:10:35,917 --> 00:10:37,686
the only thing missing
was a baseball bat.

00:10:37,752 --> 00:10:39,855
Which, based on her wounds,
you figure

00:10:39,921 --> 00:10:41,189
that was the murder weapon?
Mm-hmm.

00:10:41,256 --> 00:10:43,058
Baseball bat there,
hammer here--

00:10:43,124 --> 00:10:44,659
weapons of convenience.

00:10:44,726 --> 00:10:46,361
Guy seems to grab
whatever's handy.

00:10:46,428 --> 00:10:47,896
WILLOWS:
And takes it with him.

00:10:47,963 --> 00:10:49,631
Was the
babysitter raped?

00:10:49,698 --> 00:10:51,700
No.

00:10:51,766 --> 00:10:53,468
STOKES:
Why kidnap a kid,

00:10:53,535 --> 00:10:55,370
wait six years, then kill him?

00:10:55,437 --> 00:10:59,241
WILLOWS:
Most four year olds will do
what you tell them.

00:10:59,307 --> 00:11:02,544
Most ten year olds
will do what they want.

00:11:02,611 --> 00:11:04,279
BROWN:
Kid starts asking
the wrong questions,

00:11:04,346 --> 00:11:05,580
talking to
the wrong people...

00:11:05,647 --> 00:11:07,883
Tons of possibilities.

00:11:07,949 --> 00:11:09,417
Yes. Way too many.

00:11:09,484 --> 00:11:12,387
According to this,
the kid was adopted.

00:11:12,454 --> 00:11:14,456
Did you take a look
at the biological parents?

00:11:14,523 --> 00:11:16,858
Jason was adopted
as an infant.

00:11:16,925 --> 00:11:18,960
There was no way
we could track his records.

00:11:19,027 --> 00:11:21,029
BROWN:
Adoptive parents
had no contact

00:11:21,096 --> 00:11:22,230
with the kidnappers?

00:11:22,297 --> 00:11:24,032
They were not given
any ransom demands?

00:11:24,099 --> 00:11:25,967
There was no motive.

00:11:26,034 --> 00:11:28,103
I couldn't even give
the parents a reason.

00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:30,238
Maybe there isn't one.

00:11:30,305 --> 00:11:32,908
Most children are
abducted by somebody

00:11:32,974 --> 00:11:34,676
who's associated
with the family.

00:11:34,743 --> 00:11:38,580
Random kidnappings
are extraordinarily rare.

00:11:38,647 --> 00:11:42,751
Except in the U.S. last year,
there were almost a hundred.

00:11:45,887 --> 00:11:48,156
Some things are just random.

00:11:48,223 --> 00:11:49,491
Have you ever tried telling that

00:11:49,558 --> 00:11:51,259
to the parents of a child
who's been kidnapped?

00:11:51,326 --> 00:11:54,830
Yes, actually, I have.

00:11:54,896 --> 00:11:56,698
And how'd that work out for you?

00:12:03,872 --> 00:12:06,875
(equipment whirring)

00:12:13,248 --> 00:12:15,584
Hey, guys.

00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:18,753
Found an empty jewelry
box in the bedroom.

00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,555
Maybe the killer
swiped the jewelry

00:12:20,622 --> 00:12:22,491
in addition
to the cash.

00:12:22,557 --> 00:12:24,826
Easy to fence in
this neighborhood.

00:12:24,893 --> 00:12:28,530
Was the dead girl wearing any
jewelry when you found her?

00:12:28,597 --> 00:12:30,932
Nope.
Then that's
a good call, man,

00:12:30,999 --> 00:12:32,667
'cause she's wearing some
in just about

00:12:32,734 --> 00:12:34,135
every one
of these pictures.

00:12:34,202 --> 00:12:36,304
I wouldn't doubt if she kept
a lot of it in that box.

00:12:36,371 --> 00:12:38,006
I'll check with
the local pawn shops,

00:12:38,073 --> 00:12:39,241
see if anything's
been hocked.

00:12:46,715 --> 00:12:49,451
Hey, Greg, you see any books
on the shelf over there

00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:51,353
on gambling or poker?

00:12:51,419 --> 00:12:53,955
No, just a lot
of romance novels,

00:12:54,022 --> 00:12:56,691
mysteries and
women's health.

00:12:56,758 --> 00:12:59,494
'Cause I got poker player stats,

00:12:59,561 --> 00:13:03,665
and multiple websites
on online gambling.

00:13:03,732 --> 00:13:06,034
Seems kind of out of place
to be the victim's.

00:13:08,069 --> 00:13:09,838
I think we got
a mystery houseguest

00:13:09,905 --> 00:13:13,074
who is a card shark.

00:13:20,782 --> 00:13:23,919
(indistinct talking)

00:13:26,822 --> 00:13:29,891
MAN (over speakers):
Welcome to our annual
poker tournament.

00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:33,795
The first of the elimination
rounds are over

00:13:33,862 --> 00:13:37,065
and we're down
to our last 100 players.

00:13:37,132 --> 00:13:40,435
Good luck, everyone.

00:13:57,152 --> 00:13:59,554
(slot machines beeping)

00:14:34,789 --> 00:14:40,462
(coins clinking)

00:14:52,564 --> 00:14:53,321
Got him!

00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:21,809
You know what this is?

00:15:21,876 --> 00:15:23,411
Huh?

00:15:23,477 --> 00:15:25,079
This is police brutality.

00:15:25,146 --> 00:15:26,213
Yeah, whatever.

00:15:29,884 --> 00:15:31,619
We're not done yet.

00:15:31,686 --> 00:15:33,487
BRASS:
Well, he doesn't
look like much,

00:15:33,554 --> 00:15:35,322
but then again,
they never do.

00:15:35,389 --> 00:15:37,925
JACK:
If you don't mind,
I'd like to talk to him first.

00:15:37,992 --> 00:15:39,393
You don't have
to be polite, Jack.

00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:42,196
This is a federal case,
you don't need my permission.

00:15:46,967 --> 00:15:49,704
BRASS:
<i>How you going to go at him?</i>

00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:52,073
I don't know.

00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:56,110
I usually just make
it up as I go along.

00:16:02,783 --> 00:16:04,285
BROWN:
All done here.

00:16:04,352 --> 00:16:05,886
Thank you.

00:16:05,953 --> 00:16:07,855
You can leave, too.

00:16:12,993 --> 00:16:14,862
Mr. Michaels.

00:16:14,929 --> 00:16:19,433
Jack Malone. FBI.

00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,802
Huh.

00:16:21,869 --> 00:16:23,437
FBI.

00:16:23,504 --> 00:16:25,005
Mm-hmm.

00:16:26,841 --> 00:16:28,109
Why'd you run back there?

00:16:28,175 --> 00:16:30,444
Oh, I don't know.
I was scared, I guess.

00:16:30,511 --> 00:16:31,946
Of what?

00:16:32,012 --> 00:16:34,782
Um... of getting caught.

00:16:34,849 --> 00:16:36,951
Being embarrassed.

00:16:37,017 --> 00:16:38,686
Right.

00:16:38,753 --> 00:16:40,121
So it's probably a good idea

00:16:40,187 --> 00:16:41,956
not to do anything that
would embarrass you.

00:16:42,023 --> 00:16:43,257
Yeah, I know.

00:16:43,324 --> 00:16:45,026
But you never really think

00:16:45,092 --> 00:16:46,894
you're going
to get caught, do you?

00:16:46,961 --> 00:16:49,163
Yeah, but you did.

00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:52,633
You want to talk
about it?

00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:56,904
I got nowhere I have to be.

00:16:56,971 --> 00:16:59,774
And you got nowhere to go.

00:17:02,743 --> 00:17:06,313
(sighs sharply)

00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:09,016
I don't know what
the big deal is.

00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:11,252
I mean...

00:17:11,318 --> 00:17:13,654
we've all thought
about it, right?

00:17:13,721 --> 00:17:17,191
Sure. It's natural.

00:17:17,258 --> 00:17:18,626
Right.

00:17:18,693 --> 00:17:20,161
I had a plan.

00:17:20,227 --> 00:17:21,729
It was simple.

00:17:21,796 --> 00:17:23,964
I take it...

00:17:24,031 --> 00:17:26,534
I play with it
for a little while...

00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,302
"It"?

00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:30,538
Like it's property?

00:17:30,604 --> 00:17:32,606
Yeah, yeah,
it's nothing personal.

00:17:32,673 --> 00:17:35,376
I didn't even think Brother
Willard would even miss it.

00:17:35,443 --> 00:17:37,678
Brother Willard?

00:17:37,745 --> 00:17:41,649
You want to talk to me
about Brother Willard?

00:17:44,618 --> 00:17:45,720
(sighs)

00:17:45,786 --> 00:17:47,621
Brother Willard
is my spiritual advisor.

00:17:47,688 --> 00:17:50,124
He's supposed to talk me out
of doing things like this.

00:17:50,191 --> 00:17:52,159
But you know what?
Sometimes I just...

00:17:52,226 --> 00:17:53,828
I just feel like listening

00:17:53,894 --> 00:17:55,896
to that little voice
inside my head.

00:17:55,963 --> 00:17:58,632
Hmm.

00:17:58,699 --> 00:18:02,036
Right.

00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,309
And what is that little voice

00:18:08,376 --> 00:18:11,379
inside your head
telling you right now?

00:18:11,445 --> 00:18:15,750
Just take it.

00:18:18,753 --> 00:18:20,354
"Just take it."

00:18:20,421 --> 00:18:22,923
This is not the first time
that you've taken something

00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:24,759
that doesn't belong
to you, is it?

00:18:24,825 --> 00:18:26,027
What do you mean?

00:18:26,093 --> 00:18:28,095
Six years ago, in New York City.

00:18:28,162 --> 00:18:30,231
I don't know anything
about New York.

00:18:30,297 --> 00:18:31,665
Six years ago, in New York City,

00:18:31,732 --> 00:18:33,267
you took something
that didn't belong to you.

00:18:33,334 --> 00:18:34,502
I don't know anything
about New York.

00:18:34,568 --> 00:18:36,470
Look, I told you--
I was going to give it back.

00:18:36,537 --> 00:18:37,705
Really, I just had
some bad luck.

00:18:37,772 --> 00:18:39,440
Is that what you call it?!

00:18:39,507 --> 00:18:41,208
You abducted and murdered

00:18:41,275 --> 00:18:42,676
a four-year-old boy!

00:18:42,743 --> 00:18:44,078
I don't know what
you're talking about!

00:18:44,145 --> 00:18:45,112
Hey...
JACK:
Just bad luck?!

00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:46,714
Let him go.

00:18:46,781 --> 00:18:48,349
Look, you want
to rendition him

00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:50,184
to Gitmo, be my guest,

00:18:50,251 --> 00:18:51,686
but in this house,
we play by the rules.

00:18:51,752 --> 00:18:53,754
Now get your hand
off the suspect.

00:19:02,029 --> 00:19:03,898
What's that?

00:19:06,434 --> 00:19:09,403
That's...

00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:14,942
That's Evan. That's...

00:19:15,009 --> 00:19:18,145
This is my son.

00:19:18,212 --> 00:19:20,014
This is Evan.

00:19:52,646 --> 00:19:55,082
Guy's not the murderer.
I know.

00:19:55,149 --> 00:19:57,818
We ran his palm print.
Doesn't match.

00:19:57,885 --> 00:20:00,087
He's a Mormon from Utah.

00:20:00,154 --> 00:20:03,958
Stole $10,000 from the church,
entry money into a poker game.

00:20:04,025 --> 00:20:06,761
Figured he'd win the money,
replaced it before they noticed.

00:20:06,827 --> 00:20:08,396
And decided he'd
bring his kid with him?

00:20:08,462 --> 00:20:09,864
Single parent.

00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:12,033
Carmen Davis
is an ex-girlfriend.

00:20:12,099 --> 00:20:14,769
Dropped the kid off with her.

00:20:14,835 --> 00:20:17,872
And while he's playing cards,
they both get murdered.

00:20:17,938 --> 00:20:19,440
I got your DNA results.

00:20:19,507 --> 00:20:22,309
The dead boy was confirmed
as Tom Michael's son.

00:20:22,376 --> 00:20:25,780
So he's definitely not your
kidnap victim from New York.

00:20:25,846 --> 00:20:27,515
However, the results
of the SAE kit

00:20:27,581 --> 00:20:30,484
on the female victim
showed two semen donors.

00:20:30,551 --> 00:20:33,120
One was Tom and the other
unknown, but that unknown

00:20:33,187 --> 00:20:35,523
was connected to two unsolved
rape murders in CODIS.

00:20:35,589 --> 00:20:36,857
Excuse me.

00:20:36,924 --> 00:20:39,994
(typing)

00:20:40,061 --> 00:20:44,231
Two years ago in Wyoming,
11 months ago in Idaho.

00:20:44,298 --> 00:20:47,501
Okay, one victim was 23,
the other one 54.

00:20:47,568 --> 00:20:48,903
One blonde, one brunette.

00:20:48,969 --> 00:20:50,638
Both female.

00:20:50,705 --> 00:20:51,839
Both with their faces covered.

00:20:51,906 --> 00:20:52,973
GRISSOM:
Both single,

00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,608
with no kids.

00:20:54,675 --> 00:20:56,177
Breaks the pattern.

00:20:56,243 --> 00:20:57,712
If there is a pattern.

00:20:57,778 --> 00:21:01,382
There's a big gap between
Vegas and New York.

00:21:01,449 --> 00:21:04,352
Now, this guy
has been involved

00:21:04,418 --> 00:21:06,854
in four murders
in the last two years.

00:21:06,921 --> 00:21:08,522
There's got to be more.

00:21:08,589 --> 00:21:09,790
Well, if there are,

00:21:09,857 --> 00:21:12,059
then there may not be any
associated DNA in the system.

00:21:12,126 --> 00:21:13,794
Small towns usually
can't afford to run it

00:21:13,861 --> 00:21:15,029
if they don't have a suspect.

00:21:15,096 --> 00:21:16,530
Doesn't mean
there's not a pattern.

00:21:16,597 --> 00:21:19,533
Just means we haven't
found it yet.

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,802
(typing)

00:21:30,611 --> 00:21:31,912
Special Agent Malone.

00:21:31,979 --> 00:21:33,314
David Hodges.

00:21:33,381 --> 00:21:35,182
The granular powder
that you found

00:21:35,249 --> 00:21:36,784
on the dead boy's
neck and shirt

00:21:36,851 --> 00:21:39,620
was largely ammonium
nitrates and sulfates--

00:21:39,687 --> 00:21:41,389
commercial grade
fertilizer.

00:21:41,455 --> 00:21:42,390
(sighs)

00:21:42,456 --> 00:21:43,991
Great, so the
killer could be

00:21:44,058 --> 00:21:45,960
from any farm in
the United States.

00:21:46,027 --> 00:21:48,262
Yeah, or any backyard.

00:21:48,329 --> 00:21:49,430
Thank you.

00:21:49,497 --> 00:21:51,599
So, I was curious
about opportunities

00:21:51,665 --> 00:21:52,867
at the federal level.

00:21:52,933 --> 00:21:55,336
Pay scale,
working conditions...

00:21:55,403 --> 00:21:57,438
You want
my honest opinion?

00:21:57,505 --> 00:21:59,140
Absolutely.

00:21:59,206 --> 00:22:02,910
There's a lot less competition
in Vegas for a guy like you.

00:22:02,977 --> 00:22:05,980
The FBI has enough
ass-kissers already.

00:22:14,355 --> 00:22:15,690
I'm looking
for Tom Michaels.

00:22:15,756 --> 00:22:17,124
Yeah, he's in there.

00:22:17,191 --> 00:22:19,260
You might want to give him
a minute, though.

00:22:19,326 --> 00:22:21,162
He's, uh,
saying good-bye.

00:22:21,228 --> 00:22:23,564
Do you have any kids?

00:22:25,966 --> 00:22:28,936
Yes. I have two daughters.

00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:59,467
Um, Mr. Michaels...

00:23:02,269 --> 00:23:04,972
I wanted to apologize
for my behavior earlier.

00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,375
You're afraid I'm going to sue?

00:23:13,948 --> 00:23:16,183
The same man
who murdered your son

00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:20,454
kidnapped another
boy six years ago.

00:23:20,521 --> 00:23:22,156
He's here in Vegas, right now.

00:23:22,223 --> 00:23:24,392
And this is closest that I've
ever been to him.

00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:26,994
You thought it was me.

00:23:27,061 --> 00:23:30,064
I promise you...

00:23:30,131 --> 00:23:33,801
that I will do everything in my
power to catch this man.

00:23:33,868 --> 00:23:36,604
Is that what you told
the other boy's parents?

00:23:44,645 --> 00:23:46,614
Those the items?

00:23:47,748 --> 00:23:48,849
Yep.

00:23:48,916 --> 00:23:50,384
Damn.
This always happens to me.

00:23:50,451 --> 00:23:52,720
Is that the surveillance?

00:23:52,787 --> 00:23:55,222
Yeah.

00:23:55,289 --> 00:23:56,724
That's the guy.

00:23:56,791 --> 00:23:58,392
Okay.

00:23:58,459 --> 00:24:01,195
I almost didn't call
you guys, you know.

00:24:01,262 --> 00:24:03,864
What about me?
I'm out 350 bucks.

00:24:03,931 --> 00:24:04,865
You'll live.

00:24:04,932 --> 00:24:06,534
The woman these items
belonged to is dead,

00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,269
along with a kid.

00:24:08,335 --> 00:24:11,238
Oh.

00:24:11,305 --> 00:24:12,873
Is there a reward?

00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:15,276
Shut up. You saw him
the night before last.

00:24:15,342 --> 00:24:17,545
You talk to him?
He say anything to you?

00:24:17,611 --> 00:24:22,383
Not much. He showed me the
jewels. I gave him his $350.

00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:25,219
Uh, he asked me for directions
to the Tangiers.

00:24:25,286 --> 00:24:27,254
Hmm.
I showed him how
to get there.

00:24:27,321 --> 00:24:28,923
Recommended that
Let It Ride game.

00:24:28,989 --> 00:24:30,624
It's been pretty
lucky for me.
(phone dialing)

00:24:30,691 --> 00:24:32,860
Good for you.

00:24:32,927 --> 00:24:34,929
MAN:
Tangiers Hotel.

00:24:34,995 --> 00:24:37,365
This is Captain
Jim Brass, LVPD.

00:24:37,431 --> 00:24:40,735
Would you connect me to the
surveillance room, please?

00:24:40,801 --> 00:24:42,803
(beeping)

00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:46,006
JOHNSON:
That's definitely not a guy
you want to go home with.

00:24:46,073 --> 00:24:49,276
That cocktail waitress doesn't
know how lucky she is.

00:24:49,343 --> 00:24:51,045
We need a shot of his face.

00:24:51,112 --> 00:24:54,281
(typing)

00:24:54,348 --> 00:24:55,616
Well, I think he knows that.

00:24:55,683 --> 00:24:57,385
Just... hold on.

00:24:57,451 --> 00:24:59,253
Zoom in on the ball cap.

00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:03,457
There's a logo.

00:25:03,524 --> 00:25:08,229
(beeping)

00:25:08,295 --> 00:25:09,730
"Hargreen Harvest."

00:25:09,797 --> 00:25:12,366
He had commercial fertilizer
on his hands

00:25:12,433 --> 00:25:14,435
when he killed Evan Michaels.

00:25:14,502 --> 00:25:16,504
He's a migrant worker, perhaps.

00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:19,740
Well, Tangiers sent over more
than 12 hours on this guy.

00:25:19,807 --> 00:25:21,509
It's gonna take some
time, but of course

00:25:21,575 --> 00:25:23,911
I'll let you know the
minute I find anything.

00:25:23,978 --> 00:25:25,312
Okay, great.

00:25:27,581 --> 00:25:29,650
I'll call in
some additional AV Techs,

00:25:29,717 --> 00:25:31,752
help Archie get through the
footage, but you know,

00:25:31,819 --> 00:25:35,456
I've learned that sometimes you
can go faster by going slow.

00:25:35,523 --> 00:25:38,025
Yeah, well, I like to go
faster by going fast.

00:25:38,092 --> 00:25:40,428
Waiting around is not
exactly my best thing.

00:25:40,494 --> 00:25:41,996
I gathered that from
your interrogation technique.

00:25:42,063 --> 00:25:45,633
You know, maybe you should go
back to your hotel, take a nap.

00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:49,336
Is this your office?
Really? By choice?

00:25:49,403 --> 00:25:53,007
It's not some kind of, uh,
surplus overflow issue?

00:25:53,074 --> 00:25:55,509
What's wrong with my office?

00:25:55,576 --> 00:25:57,178
Oh, I don't know.

00:25:57,244 --> 00:26:00,147
Uh... why don't you tell me?

00:26:00,214 --> 00:26:02,149
That's an irradiated
fetal pig.

00:26:02,216 --> 00:26:05,753
I used it to determine the
effects of radiation on tissue.

00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:06,821
For what?

00:26:06,887 --> 00:26:07,955
For fun.

00:26:08,022 --> 00:26:10,057
SIDLE:
Hey, Gil, I, uh...

00:26:10,124 --> 00:26:12,360
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to interrupt.

00:26:12,426 --> 00:26:14,762
No, no, it's fine. Jack Malone,
FBI. Sara Sidle, CSI.

00:26:14,829 --> 00:26:16,330
(mutters):
Hi.

00:26:16,397 --> 00:26:20,401
Hello. I hear your abduction
case is now a serial murder.

00:26:20,468 --> 00:26:23,704
Uh... yeah.

00:26:26,741 --> 00:26:28,876
Well, uh, I got called
into work early,

00:26:28,943 --> 00:26:30,778
but I did pick up Hank,

00:26:30,845 --> 00:26:32,646
and I took him to the sitter.

00:26:32,713 --> 00:26:34,915
Thank you.
I'll see you when I see you.

00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:37,651
Pleasure.
Hmm.

00:26:37,718 --> 00:26:39,754
Is Hank your kid?

00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:42,089
Hank's my dog.
She walks him for me sometimes.

00:26:42,156 --> 00:26:45,693
Oh, yeah, that's
how it starts.

00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,563
Oh, I have some experience
dating in the workplace.

00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:53,100
Really? And, uh...

00:26:53,167 --> 00:26:55,036
how'd it work out for you?

00:26:55,102 --> 00:26:57,505
Undetermined.

00:26:57,571 --> 00:27:01,442
(children shouting and laughing)

00:27:03,444 --> 00:27:06,981
(train passing nearby,
horn blowing)

00:27:19,827 --> 00:27:21,629
(low moaning)

00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:24,765
(gasping):
Please, help me, help me...

00:27:26,867 --> 00:27:28,803
(dogs barking nearby)

00:27:28,869 --> 00:27:31,772
Kid who found the old man says
he lives here with his wife.

00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:33,007
She doesn't answer.

00:27:33,074 --> 00:27:35,643
You think the suspect's
still in here?

00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:39,447
We'll know in a minute.

00:27:39,513 --> 00:27:42,116
You better wait here.

00:28:11,212 --> 00:28:14,215
♪ ♪

00:28:18,552 --> 00:28:20,988
Sara...

00:28:36,917 --> 00:28:40,020
Does the victim have circular
indentations on her head?

00:28:40,087 --> 00:28:43,624
Yeah. You want to do the
autopsy, too? Just let me know.

00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:45,592
My guess is, this
is the hammer

00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:47,294
we didn't find at
the Davis house.

00:28:47,361 --> 00:28:50,631
Why take the murder
weapon from one scene,

00:28:50,698 --> 00:28:53,233
walk around with it
for more than a day,

00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,903
use it to kill again, but this
time leave it behind?

00:28:55,969 --> 00:28:58,505
SIDLE:
Maybe he found
something better...

00:28:58,572 --> 00:29:02,009
Colt .45 auto.

00:29:02,076 --> 00:29:03,744
Case is empty.

00:29:06,113 --> 00:29:08,549
(camera beeps, clicks)

00:29:08,615 --> 00:29:10,184
Huh.

00:29:12,486 --> 00:29:16,890
He lost the proceeds from the
Vegas murders at the Tangiers.

00:29:16,957 --> 00:29:19,159
So, he probably
needed more cash.

00:29:19,226 --> 00:29:21,061
Double murder ATM.

00:29:21,128 --> 00:29:24,198
Driver's license is
on top, like before.

00:29:24,264 --> 00:29:26,333
He likes to know their names.

00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,503
I heard the husband
died at the hospital.

00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:32,706
But the killer was definitely
here awhile.

00:29:32,773 --> 00:29:34,575
According to liver temp,

00:29:34,641 --> 00:29:36,877
she died a couple hours before
the husband.

00:29:36,944 --> 00:29:40,447
So the husband was here
and alive while his wife

00:29:40,514 --> 00:29:42,549
was being raped
and killed?

00:29:42,616 --> 00:29:44,551
It looks that way.

00:29:52,626 --> 00:29:56,230
(indistinct police radio
transmission)

00:29:56,296 --> 00:29:58,799
Sara?

00:29:58,866 --> 00:30:00,801
You okay?

00:30:00,868 --> 00:30:03,370
I don't know.

00:30:03,437 --> 00:30:06,707
Do you have any idea
how he selects his victims?

00:30:06,774 --> 00:30:08,709
No.

00:30:08,776 --> 00:30:12,446
He picks houses with no
security systems, or dogs.

00:30:12,513 --> 00:30:14,782
Enters at night when
most people are asleep,

00:30:14,848 --> 00:30:16,784
through open
doors or windows.

00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:18,585
Easy targets.

00:30:18,652 --> 00:30:21,922
So, basically at random.

00:30:23,857 --> 00:30:28,062
They were spending a night
on the sofa, watching a movie.

00:30:29,697 --> 00:30:32,232
(voice breaking):
It's just, uh...

00:30:34,635 --> 00:30:36,637
It's just wrong.

00:30:39,506 --> 00:30:42,810
(train whistle blows nearby)

00:30:42,876 --> 00:30:44,712
(indistinct police radio
transmission)

00:30:57,424 --> 00:30:59,219
(cell phone rings)

00:31:01,458 --> 00:31:02,626
Grissom.

00:31:02,692 --> 00:31:04,694
You at the Boulder City house?
No, I'm at

00:31:04,761 --> 00:31:07,364
a railroad spur about a quarter
of a mile from the house.

00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:08,932
You taking a trip?

00:31:08,999 --> 00:31:11,301
Carmen Davis's house was next to
the tracks, too.

00:31:11,368 --> 00:31:12,569
So?

00:31:12,636 --> 00:31:15,605
Freight trains carry
bulk fertilizer.

00:31:15,672 --> 00:31:19,275
I think your killer
is riding the rails.

00:31:19,342 --> 00:31:21,311
All the previous
murders were committed

00:31:21,378 --> 00:31:24,648
within about a mile
of an active railroad spur.

00:31:24,714 --> 00:31:27,350
Right, so he gets off the train,
finds his victim,

00:31:27,417 --> 00:31:29,219
kills them, rapes them
if he feels like it,

00:31:29,285 --> 00:31:30,887
then just takes off.

00:31:30,954 --> 00:31:33,957
So, I cross-referenced
similar-patterned unsolveds

00:31:34,024 --> 00:31:36,559
in ViCAP by proximity
to rail spurs.

00:31:36,626 --> 00:31:38,728
There's at least a dozen cases.

00:31:38,795 --> 00:31:41,398
You know, you have the authority
to stop all the trains

00:31:41,464 --> 00:31:42,899
coming in and
out of Nevada.

00:31:42,966 --> 00:31:45,568
Well, I'm not gonna do that
unless I got a face.

00:31:45,635 --> 00:31:47,304
If these are the work
of your guy,

00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:49,272
he's piled up
one hell of a body count.

00:31:53,143 --> 00:31:56,079
JOHNSON:
Guy kept his head down
the entire time.

00:31:56,146 --> 00:31:57,847
STOKES:
Mm-hmm.

00:31:57,914 --> 00:32:02,085
Oh, check out what happens
when he runs out of money.

00:32:02,152 --> 00:32:03,787
He starts hitting
on the waitress,

00:32:03,853 --> 00:32:06,289
been doing it to every one
of them that walked by.

00:32:06,356 --> 00:32:07,791
And this...

00:32:07,857 --> 00:32:10,293
is the last good image of him
before he leaves the casino.

00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:14,898
He stops to look at this poster
and quickly makes a phone call.

00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,635
STOKES:
Three numbers?

00:32:18,702 --> 00:32:22,339
I don't know too many serial
killers that dial 911.

00:32:22,405 --> 00:32:24,607
He's calling Information.

00:32:24,674 --> 00:32:27,310
(dialing cell phone)

00:32:27,377 --> 00:32:30,547
Uh, yes, this is CSI Nick Stokes
with the Vegas PD.

00:32:30,613 --> 00:32:32,549
I need to get
the telephone number

00:32:32,615 --> 00:32:35,151
of one of your pay phones
on the casino floor.

00:32:35,218 --> 00:32:37,787
Near the, uh,
Let It Ride tables.

00:32:37,854 --> 00:32:39,055
Yes, ma'am.

00:32:39,122 --> 00:32:42,292
So, why was he so
interested in this poster?

00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:44,461
Oh, great. Okay.

00:32:46,696 --> 00:32:48,632
Mm-hmm.

00:32:48,698 --> 00:32:51,134
Very good.
Thank you.

00:32:51,201 --> 00:32:52,902
Look at this.
What is it?

00:32:52,969 --> 00:32:55,705
South Point Casino,
just outside Boulder City.

00:32:55,772 --> 00:32:57,607
Might be a reason
he went there.

00:32:59,609 --> 00:33:00,777
(sighs)

00:33:00,844 --> 00:33:02,545
(dialing number)

00:33:02,612 --> 00:33:05,882
Hey, it's Nick.
Uh, I need to get an AG waiver

00:33:05,949 --> 00:33:07,917
to get ahold
of some phone numbers.

00:33:07,984 --> 00:33:09,853
Yeah, exigent circs.

00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:12,255
Mm-hmm.

00:33:12,322 --> 00:33:16,993
702-555-0177.

00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,228
At, uh...

00:33:18,295 --> 00:33:19,396
17-41-33.

00:33:19,462 --> 00:33:21,164
17-41-33.

00:33:22,207 --> 00:33:24,909
Yes, ma'am,
day before yesterday.

00:33:24,976 --> 00:33:27,145
Well, we know this guy
likes waitresses,

00:33:27,212 --> 00:33:30,048
so maybe that's what
he's looking at.

00:33:30,115 --> 00:33:31,783
Is that a "D"?

00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:35,687
No. "G," "G-I-R"... "N"?

00:33:35,754 --> 00:33:37,125
Okay, thanks.

00:33:37,125 --> 00:33:38,392
Gina.

00:33:38,459 --> 00:33:39,917
Gina Farentino.

00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:41,886
He called Information to get
her number in Boulder City,

00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:42,954
but it's unlisted.

00:33:44,822 --> 00:33:46,591
Maybe that's
what pissed him off.

00:33:46,658 --> 00:33:49,527
He knows where she works.

00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:56,567
Yeah, Gina works here;
she's off today, though.

00:33:56,634 --> 00:33:57,702
Probably at home.

00:33:57,769 --> 00:33:59,537
We checked her house;
she's not there.

00:33:59,604 --> 00:34:01,539
When was the last
time you saw her?

00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:02,640
Not since yesterday.

00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:06,444
What about this
guy, seen him?

00:34:08,513 --> 00:34:11,049
This is the best
picture you got?
What do you think?

00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:15,687
There was a guy...

00:34:15,753 --> 00:34:17,355
I don't know if it's him.

00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:19,257
He was was on those slots
when Gina came on her shift.

00:34:19,324 --> 00:34:22,927
(slot machine beeping,
bells ringing)

00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:24,929
<i>Guess it was his lucky day.</i>

00:34:25,708 --> 00:34:27,792
<i>Must've thought the jackpot</i>
<i>gave him a shot at her.</i>

00:34:27,792 --> 00:34:29,094
<i>He started chatting her up.</i>

00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,428
Oh...

00:34:30,495 --> 00:34:31,896
Where are you going?
No, no, no, no.

00:34:31,963 --> 00:34:33,898
Hey, come here, come here.
What time do you get off?

00:34:33,965 --> 00:34:35,533
<i>She blew him off and left.</i>

00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,768
<i>Said she wasn't feeling well.</i>

00:34:36,835 --> 00:34:38,369
And when did he leave?

00:34:38,436 --> 00:34:40,872
He cashed out
and left a few minutes later.

00:34:40,939 --> 00:34:42,240
How much did he win?

00:34:42,307 --> 00:34:44,375
Um...

00:34:44,442 --> 00:34:45,610
$2,500.

00:34:45,677 --> 00:34:48,446
I need to take a look
at his W2-G, okay?

00:34:49,834 --> 00:34:51,458
If you make over
twelve hundred bucks,

00:34:51,458 --> 00:34:53,927
Uncle Sam gets
his cut, you know?

00:34:53,993 --> 00:34:55,862
That's how
we stay in business.

00:34:55,929 --> 00:34:58,498
Mm-hmm.

00:34:58,565 --> 00:35:00,200
It's got name,
address, social...

00:35:00,266 --> 00:35:01,935
The whole thing
has got to be bogus.

00:35:02,001 --> 00:35:04,471
Yeah, the cashiers don't really
seem to care, no offense,

00:35:04,537 --> 00:35:08,775
as long as you have
a picture ID.

00:35:08,842 --> 00:35:12,278
And even when that's fake...

00:35:12,345 --> 00:35:14,147
you can't fake one of those.

00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:21,488

00:36:44,625 --> 00:36:46,160
.45 auto.

00:36:46,226 --> 00:36:48,896
Same caliber as the one taken
from the Boulder City double.

00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:52,016
You can see the whole thing
on video if you want.

00:36:52,083 --> 00:36:55,386
Was the waitress
in the car with him?

00:36:55,453 --> 00:36:57,488
He was waving at somebody
in the passenger seat

00:36:57,555 --> 00:36:58,656
when he got shot.

00:36:58,723 --> 00:37:01,326
According to the time code
on the dash cam,

00:37:01,392 --> 00:37:02,727
it was about 33
minutes ago.

00:37:02,794 --> 00:37:05,296
That's a pretty good head start.
Yeah.

00:37:05,363 --> 00:37:06,531
I don't want to lose this guy.

00:37:06,598 --> 00:37:08,766

00:37:17,709 --> 00:37:19,043
Got an AFIS hit.

00:37:20,812 --> 00:37:24,015
Served two years in Sing Sing
for burglary.

00:37:24,082 --> 00:37:25,216

00:37:25,283 --> 00:37:26,718
before Jack's original
kidnapping,

00:37:26,784 --> 00:37:29,053
and get this,
when he was sent up,

00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,256
he was married
to Gina Farentino.

00:37:31,322 --> 00:37:34,058
Brass put out a broadcast.

00:37:34,125 --> 00:37:35,059
Listen, do me a favor.

00:37:35,126 --> 00:37:36,227

16 miles northeast
of your location.

No, but I called
the tow company.

You can't park here.

00:38:39,824 --> 00:38:41,092

00:38:41,159 --> 00:38:42,560

No, and nothing else
is scheduled for another hour.
