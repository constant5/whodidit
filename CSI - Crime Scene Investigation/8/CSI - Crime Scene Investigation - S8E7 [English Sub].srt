00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:34,294
(party music playing)

00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:39,366
Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink!
Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink!

00:00:39,433 --> 00:00:41,835
Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink!
Drink! Drink! Drink!

00:00:41,902 --> 00:00:43,370
Yeah!

00:00:43,437 --> 00:00:45,672
Drink! Drink! Drink!
Drink! Drink! Drink!

00:00:45,739 --> 00:00:46,673
Yeah!

00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:47,841
Drink!

00:00:47,908 --> 00:00:49,810
Drink! Drink! Drink!
Drink! Drink! Drink!

00:00:49,877 --> 00:00:52,346
Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink...!

00:00:52,412 --> 00:00:54,848
(woman moaning ecstatically

00:00:54,915 --> 00:00:57,885
(moaning and grunting)

00:00:57,951 --> 00:00:59,219
(laughs)

00:00:59,286 --> 00:01:00,854
(sighs)

00:01:00,921 --> 00:01:02,856
(moaning grows louder)

00:01:02,923 --> 00:01:04,858
(sighs)

00:01:04,925 --> 00:01:06,927
(laughing)

00:01:07,928 --> 00:01:09,196
(man laughs)

00:01:09,263 --> 00:01:11,999
(both panting)

00:01:14,234 --> 00:01:16,170
(woman moans)

00:01:16,236 --> 00:01:18,238
(man sighs contentedly)

00:01:33,353 --> 00:01:35,956
(camera shutter clicking)

00:01:36,023 --> 00:01:38,125
(garbled police radio chatter)

00:01:38,192 --> 00:01:40,394
(crowd clamoring)

00:01:46,066 --> 00:01:48,936
(camera shutter clicking)

00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:53,710
Sorry, no ID.

00:01:53,777 --> 00:01:57,814
It's okay. Brass
has a line on the
resident director.

00:01:57,881 --> 00:01:59,549
WOMAN:
Lanie!

00:01:59,616 --> 00:02:01,384
Oh, my God, no!

00:02:01,451 --> 00:02:04,087
My God, Lanie, I can't
believe it. You really did it.

00:02:04,154 --> 00:02:06,456
Hey! Let her on through.

00:02:08,058 --> 00:02:09,993
Monica!

00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,995
Lanie!

00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,132
Don't you ever
die on me! Promise!

00:02:15,198 --> 00:02:18,101
I won't.
I promise.

00:02:18,168 --> 00:02:19,636
(garbled police radio chatter)

00:02:21,671 --> 00:02:23,607
It's the third jumper
on campus this year.

00:02:23,673 --> 00:02:26,643
Maybe it's contagious.

00:02:28,945 --> 00:02:31,414
I saw this documentary once
on suicides

00:02:31,481 --> 00:02:33,416
off the Golden Gate Bridge,

00:02:33,483 --> 00:02:35,919
and they
interviewed
a survivor

00:02:35,986 --> 00:02:39,489
and he said the moment
that he let go of the railing,

00:02:39,556 --> 00:02:42,459
he realized that all of
his problems were fixable,

00:02:42,526 --> 00:02:44,127
except for
having jumped.

00:02:46,229 --> 00:02:47,998
(rattling handlebar)

00:02:48,064 --> 00:02:49,633
Hey, Catherine.

00:02:49,699 --> 00:02:50,634
(radio beeps)

00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,135
Uh, yeah, Nicky,
what you got?

00:02:52,202 --> 00:02:53,470
Chains and padlocks.

00:02:53,537 --> 00:02:55,472
There's no roof access
from the dorm.

00:02:55,539 --> 00:02:57,274
Well, the body landed
close to the building,

00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,276
so if she didn't
come from the roof,

00:02:59,342 --> 00:03:01,278
she must have come
out of a room.

00:03:01,344 --> 00:03:03,213
Okay, I'll work my way down.

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,215
BRASS (over radio):
Nick, you in the dorm?

00:03:05,282 --> 00:03:07,317
That's affirmative.

00:03:07,384 --> 00:03:08,652
I'm with the
resident director.

00:03:08,718 --> 00:03:10,821
He's ID'd the victim
as Kira Dellinger.

00:03:10,887 --> 00:03:12,322
She's in Room 807.

00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:14,891
She's a freshman
from McLean, Virginia.

00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:17,761
I guess I'm going to go
notify the parents.

00:03:17,828 --> 00:03:19,529
STOKES:
Perks of the job.

00:03:19,596 --> 00:03:21,264
Yeah.

00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:04,074
(garbled police radio chatter)

00:04:18,755 --> 00:04:22,058
Hey, Catherine, do you see
any wounds on the body

00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:23,059
inconsistent with the fall?

00:04:23,126 --> 00:04:25,061
Hang on.

00:04:25,128 --> 00:04:26,029
I did find this.

00:04:26,096 --> 00:04:28,732
Yeah, there's a

00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:31,601
long perimortem abrasion
on the lower back.

00:04:31,668 --> 00:04:33,370
I think I know
how it got there.

00:04:33,437 --> 00:04:35,205
(screaming)

00:04:35,272 --> 00:04:37,407
(yelling frantically):
No!

00:04:38,775 --> 00:04:40,577

Oh, sorry.

00:05:45,239 --> 00:05:46,574
(sighs)

00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,175
Ah.

00:05:48,242 --> 00:05:49,810
"Zopidem"?

00:05:49,877 --> 00:05:51,145
That's good stuff.

00:05:51,211 --> 00:05:52,880
Yeah, it's to help me sleep.

00:05:52,947 --> 00:05:54,682
I've been having
the hardest time lately.

00:05:54,748 --> 00:05:56,016
Me, too.

00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:59,019
Well, just coming off of grave
after all these years,

00:05:59,086 --> 00:06:00,988
you know, takes
a while to adjust.

00:06:01,055 --> 00:06:03,257
You're a tough cookie.
I'm not worried about you.

00:06:03,324 --> 00:06:05,192
Take care of yourself, huh?

00:06:05,259 --> 00:06:06,827
Thanks.
Yeah.

00:06:08,162 --> 00:06:09,763
Sweet dreams.

00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:10,831
Thanks.

00:06:14,668 --> 00:06:16,003
Oh...

00:06:19,506 --> 00:06:20,774
LAKE:
Hey.

00:06:20,841 --> 00:06:22,309
Sara, you done with your scene?

00:06:22,376 --> 00:06:24,378
Yeah.
Great, because

00:06:24,445 --> 00:06:25,679
we just caught another one.

00:06:25,746 --> 00:06:26,780
425 off Craig Road.

00:06:26,847 --> 00:06:29,984
Busy shift, but you
know I like that.

00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:32,720
I'll see you outside, okay?
Okay.

00:06:49,637 --> 00:06:52,072
OFFICER:
Neighbors called in
a domestic disturbance

00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:54,141
between Adam
and Kim Jimenez.

00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:56,510
I responded, knocked

00:06:56,577 --> 00:06:57,878
and didn't get any answer,

00:06:57,945 --> 00:06:59,480
so I looked
through the window,

00:06:59,546 --> 00:07:01,081
and this is
what I saw.

00:07:01,148 --> 00:07:02,917
Nobody's home, so
I called you guys.

00:07:26,273 --> 00:07:29,076
Blood but no body.

00:07:29,143 --> 00:07:31,912
No sign of the couple.
OFFICER:
No.

00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:33,747
Nothing.

00:07:35,449 --> 00:07:37,151
SIDLE:
Lots of blood activity here.

00:07:41,121 --> 00:07:43,057
LAKE:
Then someone ran out the door.

00:07:47,828 --> 00:07:48,762
Stop right there.

00:07:48,829 --> 00:07:50,965
Hands where I can see 'em.

00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,435
This is my house.

00:07:54,501 --> 00:07:55,936
Mrs. Jimenez?

00:07:57,171 --> 00:07:58,806
Where have you been?

00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,577
My husband and I
had an argument.

00:08:03,644 --> 00:08:05,312
I went on a walk.

00:08:05,379 --> 00:08:07,848
Where's your husband now?

00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:12,119
I, uh...

00:08:12,186 --> 00:08:13,520
I don't know.

00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:20,660
Mr. Jimenez,
are you okay?

00:08:20,727 --> 00:08:21,895
Bad back.

00:08:23,997 --> 00:08:25,098
LAKE:
Sara,

00:08:25,165 --> 00:08:27,066
she's got a very bad back.

00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:31,571
This is CSI Lake.

00:08:31,638 --> 00:08:33,406
We need paramedics
right away on location.

00:08:33,473 --> 00:08:36,709
(camera shutter clicking)

00:08:48,855 --> 00:08:49,856
Hey.

00:08:49,923 --> 00:08:50,924
Hey.

00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:53,126
What do you think this might be?

00:08:54,627 --> 00:08:58,131
Well, possibly a tooth fragment.

00:08:58,198 --> 00:08:59,299
High fall?

00:08:59,365 --> 00:09:00,300
Yeah.

00:09:00,366 --> 00:09:02,068
We think she was pushed.

00:09:02,135 --> 00:09:05,038
So, between her knuckles--

00:09:05,104 --> 00:09:06,372
suggests a struggle.

00:09:06,439 --> 00:09:07,373
No!

00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,575
(blow lands)
(groans)

00:09:08,641 --> 00:09:10,643
Ah!

00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:12,812
(screaming)

00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:15,481
Was she raped?
There's no trauma,

00:09:15,548 --> 00:09:18,484
but the wet mount indicates
that she definitely had sex.

00:09:18,551 --> 00:09:21,321
Oh, no condom. Good for us.

00:09:21,387 --> 00:09:22,622
Yeah.

00:09:24,624 --> 00:09:27,160
Such a scary thing,
sending your kid off to college.

00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,776
Is Lindsey looking already?

00:09:29,843 --> 00:09:30,878
Yeah.

00:09:30,944 --> 00:09:34,548
In fact, we looked at WLVU
last month.

00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:37,551
Well, at least
she'd be close to home.

00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:39,553
She's free on campus,

00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,156
might as well be
a thousand miles away.

00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,762
(soft trilling, beeping)

00:09:54,234 --> 00:09:55,502
Hey.

00:09:55,569 --> 00:09:57,070
Hey.

00:09:57,137 --> 00:09:59,640
Any luck with dorm security?
Nope.

00:09:59,706 --> 00:10:01,642
There's no cameras,
only key cards,

00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:03,410
but according
to the residence director,

00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:05,412
the door's propped open
all the time anyway.

00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:07,080
Okay.

00:10:07,147 --> 00:10:08,649
(computer beeps and trills)

00:10:08,715 --> 00:10:10,317
SANDERS:
Kind of hard to tell

00:10:10,384 --> 00:10:11,819
the difference
between a struggle

00:10:11,885 --> 00:10:13,821
and a typical
college dorm room.

00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,823
Yeah. You should
have seen mine.

00:10:15,889 --> 00:10:17,891
It was really bad.

00:10:29,102 --> 00:10:31,672
Hmm. "X" marks the girl.

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,375
Symbol for a "straight edge"
lifestyle.

00:10:35,442 --> 00:10:37,945
Abstinence from drugs,
tobacco,

00:10:38,011 --> 00:10:39,513
alcohol...

00:10:42,182 --> 00:10:44,117
...but not sex.

00:10:44,184 --> 00:10:45,953
Sexual lubricant.

00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:47,754
Give me that.

00:10:49,623 --> 00:10:51,725
So, pretty brave
for college.

00:10:51,792 --> 00:10:55,529
Yeah, or just another way
to get attention.

00:10:59,733 --> 00:11:03,470
Looks like our vic
was in a Goth band.

00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:05,472
You know, I used to be Goth.

00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:07,241
Mm-hmm.

00:11:07,307 --> 00:11:09,076
Yeah, the Goth thing
was just an act.

00:11:09,143 --> 00:11:10,377
Chicks dug it.

00:11:10,444 --> 00:11:12,312
How does that work?

00:11:12,379 --> 00:11:15,249
You act depressed to get chicks,
you get depressed chicks.

00:11:15,315 --> 00:11:16,550
(chuckles)

00:11:24,591 --> 00:11:28,529
(door opening)

00:11:28,595 --> 00:11:30,063
Baby, are you okay?

00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:32,032
Are you all right?

00:11:32,099 --> 00:11:33,333
You doing okay, huh?

00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,936
You all right?
You okay? Yeah?

00:11:36,003 --> 00:11:37,938
Did you call
these cops on me?

00:11:38,005 --> 00:11:39,840
(weakly):
No...
Did you call
the cops on me?!

00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:42,743
(shouting)
I didn't call the cops!

00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:46,647
(shouting becomes
slow, distorted)

00:11:55,989 --> 00:12:00,327
(distorted, indistinct
yelling continues)

00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,435
It's okay now.
Sara?

00:12:08,502 --> 00:12:10,737
Why don't you
finish up here?

00:12:10,804 --> 00:12:11,805
Wait a minute.

00:12:11,872 --> 00:12:13,307
How are we going
to handle this?

00:12:13,373 --> 00:12:14,908
Well, the guy's
under arrest.

00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:16,877
He'll be free
by tomorrow.

00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:20,180
Her husband is obviously
abusing her.

00:12:20,247 --> 00:12:21,615
(sighs)

00:12:21,682 --> 00:12:23,417
There's got to be something
we can do.

00:12:23,484 --> 00:12:26,153
We'll be back
for her body next month.

00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,488
Or his. Or both.

00:12:29,656 --> 00:12:32,292
There is nothing
you can do about this, Ronnie.

00:12:32,359 --> 00:12:33,627
Don't kid yourself.

00:12:59,853 --> 00:13:02,389
♪ ♪

00:13:19,907 --> 00:13:21,341
Sara, I've got
something really good

00:13:21,408 --> 00:13:22,876
on that defenestrated
college kid.

00:13:22,943 --> 00:13:24,011
Oh, that's
Catherine's case.

00:13:24,077 --> 00:13:25,546
Or, you know what,
talk to Nick.

00:13:25,612 --> 00:13:27,414
No, no, no, you're really
going to love this.

00:13:27,481 --> 00:13:29,883
A print on a lube tube matched
a print on her windowsill.

00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:31,752
AFIS got a hit.

00:13:34,488 --> 00:13:36,623
Ever think you'd
see that guy again?

00:13:41,461 --> 00:13:46,333
STOKES:
<i>Marlon West was on trial for</i>
<i>the murder of Stacy Vollmer.</i>

00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,835
He confessed.

00:13:47,901 --> 00:13:50,003
It was later thrown out
on a technicality.

00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:51,305
We really didn't need it.

00:13:51,371 --> 00:13:53,674
The prosecution's case against
Marlon was very strong.

00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,275
Until Marlon's
little sister Hannah

00:13:55,342 --> 00:13:57,478
got on the stand and confessed
to the murder herself.

00:13:57,544 --> 00:14:00,547
Marlon didn't kill Stacy.

00:14:00,614 --> 00:14:02,082
I did.

00:14:02,149 --> 00:14:05,853
And I was wearing this
when I did it.

00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:08,388
Oh, yes, I remember this case.

00:14:08,455 --> 00:14:10,224
A high school senior
at age 12.

00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:11,625
She's a prodigy.

00:14:11,692 --> 00:14:13,694
She's a pint-size
Machiavelli.

00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,064
She manipulated events,
fabricated evidence,

00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,732
and in the end...

00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:21,268
We, the jury, find the
defendant, Marlon West

00:14:21,335 --> 00:14:22,269
not guilty.

00:14:22,336 --> 00:14:24,838
STOKES:
<i>...snowed the jury.</i>

00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:26,373
SIDLE:
<i>And me.</i>

00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,342
Hannah, you are smart.

00:14:28,408 --> 00:14:30,310
But you have to be really smart

00:14:30,377 --> 00:14:33,380
to make people think
things happened that never did.

00:14:33,447 --> 00:14:37,084
What do you mean exactly?

00:14:39,953 --> 00:14:42,489
I didn't kill Stacy.

00:14:42,556 --> 00:14:45,225
Marlon did.

00:14:45,292 --> 00:14:47,561
She claimed that she did it

00:14:47,628 --> 00:14:48,929
because she
loved Marlon.

00:14:48,996 --> 00:14:50,797
Some warped
sense of justice...

00:14:50,864 --> 00:14:52,533
She graduated
later that summer,

00:14:52,599 --> 00:14:53,934
became legally emancipated
from her parents

00:14:54,001 --> 00:14:55,068
and went off to Harvard.

00:14:55,135 --> 00:14:56,670
Pre-med.

00:14:56,737 --> 00:14:58,305
You keeping tabs on her?

00:14:58,372 --> 00:15:00,474
Not recently.

00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:03,577
Look, accident or no accident,
Marlon killed before.

00:15:03,644 --> 00:15:05,579
Hannah sunk this case;
Marlon got a free pass;

00:15:05,646 --> 00:15:06,713
and now he's killed again.

00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,649
Well, we don't
know that just yet.

00:15:08,715 --> 00:15:10,417
I mean, we don't have
Marlon's DNA

00:15:10,484 --> 00:15:12,953
to compare with the semen
that was found in the victim.

00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,888
All the old evidence was
expunged with the verdict.

00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:16,757
I want this case.

00:15:16,824 --> 00:15:18,225
The one that got away?

00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,894
We're not supposed to let them
get away, right?

00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:23,497
GRISSOM:
Okay.

00:15:23,564 --> 00:15:25,999
I'll see if I can clear it
with Ecklie.

00:15:26,066 --> 00:15:27,467
Catherine has to
supervise, though.

00:15:27,534 --> 00:15:28,969
You report to her.

00:15:31,872 --> 00:15:35,876
(indistinct conversations)

00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:46,587
Hello, Marlon.

00:15:46,653 --> 00:15:48,755
What are you guys doing here?

00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:50,591
We here to talk to you
about Kira Dellinger.

00:15:50,657 --> 00:15:53,527
Kira committed suicide.

00:15:53,594 --> 00:15:55,128
Actually, she was murdered.

00:15:57,464 --> 00:15:59,600
Somebody I know ends up dead
and I'm automatically

00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:00,868
a suspect?

00:16:00,934 --> 00:16:02,669
History has a way
of repeating itself, Marlon.

00:16:02,736 --> 00:16:04,204
You've killed before, you know?

00:16:04,271 --> 00:16:05,606
That was an accident.

00:16:05,672 --> 00:16:08,642
And I admitted I was responsible
from day one.

00:16:08,709 --> 00:16:10,978
Kira was forced out
her dorm window.

00:16:11,044 --> 00:16:12,279
Your prints were there.

00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:13,514
My prints were there

00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,215
because I've been in there
a million times.

00:16:15,282 --> 00:16:17,050
Kira and I were in a band.

00:16:17,117 --> 00:16:18,952
Your prints were
also found on a tube

00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,155
of sexual lubricant.
Were you having

00:16:21,221 --> 00:16:22,456
sex with her, Marlon?

00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:24,391
Yeah, we were having sex.
Last night?

00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:26,960
No, we had a gig last night.

00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:29,329
We... We got into a fight.

00:16:29,396 --> 00:16:31,098
Did she give you
that fat lip?

00:16:34,268 --> 00:16:35,869
No, not exactly.

00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,340
Kira! Kira!

00:16:41,275 --> 00:16:42,709
Keep your hands off her!

00:16:50,117 --> 00:16:51,385
I'm done!

00:16:51,451 --> 00:16:54,721
From now on, you stay
away from me, psycho!

00:16:56,256 --> 00:16:59,159
I don't know who the guy was.
I had never seen him before.

00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:01,395
After that, I just...

00:17:01,461 --> 00:17:04,331
wandered the campus
most of the night by myself.

00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:05,899
So you don't have an alibi.

00:17:05,966 --> 00:17:07,434
I guess I don't.

00:17:07,501 --> 00:17:08,769
Well, I'll tell you what.

00:17:08,836 --> 00:17:10,771
We will give you
the benefit of the doubt

00:17:10,838 --> 00:17:11,872
in exchange for this.

00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:13,373
You remember this.

00:17:16,977 --> 00:17:18,679
I assume you have
a DNA warrant, Sara.

00:17:18,745 --> 00:17:20,414
Because if you don't,

00:17:20,481 --> 00:17:22,449
you certainly
don't have his consent.

00:17:22,516 --> 00:17:23,951
Isn't that right, Marlon?

00:17:24,017 --> 00:17:25,853
Hannah, I heard
you were

00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,755
studying back east--
what are you doing here?

00:17:28,822 --> 00:17:30,457
Graduate school.

00:17:30,524 --> 00:17:33,193
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,732
You are not going to muddy
the waters this time.

00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,934
Are you sure
you'd know if I had?

00:17:42,002 --> 00:17:43,604
You're welcome to stay.

00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:46,073
You might learn something.

00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:58,252
Please turn to page 187,

00:17:58,318 --> 00:18:00,041
the Clausius-
Clapeyron equation.

00:18:01,417 --> 00:18:04,487
Oh, by the way, Professor Costin
said it'll be on the exam.

00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:10,076
BRASS:
I don't know, Sara.

00:18:10,142 --> 00:18:11,944
It's going to be tough
to get a warrant.

00:18:12,011 --> 00:18:12,978
I need Marlon West's DNA.

00:18:13,045 --> 00:18:14,413
If his semen
is in Kira Dellinger,

00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,648
it puts him at the murder.

00:18:15,715 --> 00:18:17,083
Look, they had a known
sexual relationship,

00:18:17,149 --> 00:18:18,208
so there's no
evidence of rape.

00:18:18,275 --> 00:18:19,843
And I don't know
if you know this,

00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:20,878
but Marlon's mother
and father

00:18:20,944 --> 00:18:22,512
were killed in a car
accident last year.

00:18:22,579 --> 00:18:24,581
Judge Bowman is going to be
very sensitive to that.

00:18:24,648 --> 00:18:25,883
It could look
like harassment.

00:18:25,949 --> 00:18:28,185
Jim, are you going to talk
to the judge or not?

00:18:28,252 --> 00:18:30,787
Wow, you really
got it out for this kid.

00:18:30,854 --> 00:18:32,189
What's the deal here, Sara?

00:18:32,256 --> 00:18:34,191
Marlon West has killed before.

00:18:34,258 --> 00:18:35,759
Not according
to a jury of his peers.

00:18:35,826 --> 00:18:38,762
Did you have fun talking
to Kira Dellinger's parents?

00:18:38,829 --> 00:18:40,430
Excuse me?

00:18:40,497 --> 00:18:42,499
Must've been a lot of screaming
and crying and despair.

00:18:42,566 --> 00:18:44,501
Yeah, there usually is.
What's your point, Sara?

00:18:44,568 --> 00:18:48,138
My point is, if we had done
our job right the first time,

00:18:48,205 --> 00:18:49,740
Marlon West would be in jail,

00:18:49,806 --> 00:18:52,042
and Kira Dellinger
would still be alive.

00:18:53,577 --> 00:18:55,245
Talk to the judge.

00:18:57,648 --> 00:19:00,384
ANDREWS:
HPLC found high levels
of gamma-hydroxybutyric acid

00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:01,852
in Kira Dellinger's blood.

00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,820
GHB does occur
naturally in the body.

00:19:03,887 --> 00:19:05,155
You sure she
was drugged?

00:19:05,222 --> 00:19:06,490
Pretty sure.

00:19:06,557 --> 00:19:08,759
Started to metabolize in her
blood and urine when she died.

00:19:08,825 --> 00:19:10,227
That typically
indicates dosing.

00:19:10,294 --> 00:19:13,564
Okay, so then maybe she was
roofied, raped, then murdered.

00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:16,333
And no vaginal trauma because
she was too numb to resist.

00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,834
It's possible.

00:19:17,901 --> 00:19:19,503
You know, some people
take GHB recreationally.

00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:23,006
I didn't find any drug
paraphernalia in her room.

00:19:23,073 --> 00:19:25,742
It was pretty consistent with
a "straight edge" lifestyle.

00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:27,344
You know, that just
sounds like something

00:19:27,411 --> 00:19:29,846
a girl tells her parents in
order to make them feel better.

00:19:29,913 --> 00:19:31,815
I mean, we know she had sex.

00:19:31,882 --> 00:19:33,383
There was GHB in her system...

00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:36,186
I think you just need to test
everything in her room

00:19:36,253 --> 00:19:38,922
that she may have ingested.
(sighs):
Okay.

00:19:38,989 --> 00:19:41,158
JOHNSON:
So this is her Twitter page.

00:19:41,225 --> 00:19:43,627
Got e-mails, IMs,

00:19:43,694 --> 00:19:44,928
text messages.

00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:48,111
A minute-by-minute diary
of Kira Dellinger's life.

00:19:48,178 --> 00:19:50,880
With the last post a couple
hours before she died.

00:19:50,947 --> 00:19:53,216
What made you think
to check her Twitter page?

00:19:53,283 --> 00:19:55,652
Well, most date rape victims
know their assailants,

00:19:55,719 --> 00:19:58,355
and Kira was an active blogger,
so I figured

00:19:58,421 --> 00:19:59,956
if she was having trouble
with anyone,

00:20:00,023 --> 00:20:01,358
she'd probably
talk about it online.

00:20:01,424 --> 00:20:03,960
Some people just
don't value privacy.

00:20:04,027 --> 00:20:05,729
They don't expect privacy.

00:20:05,795 --> 00:20:07,864
They value openness.

00:20:07,931 --> 00:20:10,634
Whatever.

00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,869
(typing)
Hmm.

00:20:12,936 --> 00:20:16,806
"It shouldn't suck when two boys
fight over you, but it does.

00:20:16,873 --> 00:20:18,608
"Drummerboy19 won't be a man.

00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:21,911
"And TorchX wants
what he can't have.

00:20:21,978 --> 00:20:24,914
They both bug."

00:20:24,981 --> 00:20:27,217
Looks like a virtual
love triangle to me.

00:20:27,284 --> 00:20:30,086
My guess is
DrummerBoy19 is Marlon.

00:20:30,153 --> 00:20:33,356
Well, TorchX responded to that.

00:20:35,425 --> 00:20:38,695
"KiraEdge, you know
I never give up."

00:20:38,762 --> 00:20:40,163
That could be a threat.

00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,665
Let's see
if this "TorchX"

00:20:41,731 --> 00:20:43,333
has a real name.

00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,734
(typing)

00:20:46,603 --> 00:20:47,704
Jordan Rockwell.

00:20:47,771 --> 00:20:51,975
I guess he values
openness, too.

00:20:57,847 --> 00:20:59,616
BRASS:
Mr. Rockwell,
do you know this girl?

00:20:59,683 --> 00:21:01,284
Yeah, sure.

00:21:01,351 --> 00:21:03,353
It's Kira Dellinger.

00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:06,690
When was the last
time you saw her?

00:21:06,756 --> 00:21:08,592
Uh... last night.

00:21:08,658 --> 00:21:09,726
Hmm. Where?

00:21:09,793 --> 00:21:11,494
At her place.

00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:14,097
We had sex.

00:21:14,164 --> 00:21:15,832
Nice. How did that happen?

00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:17,567
We used to date
in high school.

00:21:17,634 --> 00:21:20,870
Then we reconnected
online, and, uh...

00:21:20,937 --> 00:21:24,040
I came down to the campus
to check out her band.

00:21:24,107 --> 00:21:26,710
So she gave you a roll
for old times' sake.

00:21:26,776 --> 00:21:30,447
Well, I, uh...
I kind of helped her out

00:21:30,513 --> 00:21:31,915
with a boyfriend problem.

00:21:31,982 --> 00:21:34,250
Is this the problem?

00:21:34,317 --> 00:21:35,452
Yeah.

00:21:35,518 --> 00:21:38,421
Yeah, that's the guy.

00:21:38,488 --> 00:21:39,756
He was, uh...

00:21:39,823 --> 00:21:42,158
he was into her,
you know, but she...

00:21:42,225 --> 00:21:43,660
she was not into him.

00:21:43,727 --> 00:21:45,195
And he started
giving her static,

00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:48,832
so... I knocked the little
douche's teeth out.

00:21:48,898 --> 00:21:51,001
I guess she
kind of liked it,

00:21:51,067 --> 00:21:54,104
because she took me
back to her place after that.

00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:55,572
Then what?

00:21:55,639 --> 00:21:57,507
I want to know everything
up until the time

00:21:57,574 --> 00:21:59,409
when you wrapped your car
around that telephone pole.

00:21:59,476 --> 00:22:01,978
She fell asleep...

00:22:02,045 --> 00:22:04,314
and then I started feeling sick,

00:22:04,381 --> 00:22:08,451
so I, uh, got my car
to drive home.

00:22:08,518 --> 00:22:10,520
Then I got
really dizzy

00:22:10,587 --> 00:22:14,391
and, uh... wham.

00:22:16,726 --> 00:22:17,794
That's it.

00:22:17,861 --> 00:22:20,797
So she was alive
the last time you saw her.

00:22:20,864 --> 00:22:24,868
Wh-What do you mean,
"she was alive"?

00:22:24,935 --> 00:22:27,137
She's dead.

00:22:30,941 --> 00:22:33,143
SANDERS:
According to Brass,
officers at the crash scene

00:22:33,209 --> 00:22:35,178
suspected that Jordan Rockwell
was under the influence,

00:22:35,245 --> 00:22:37,047
so the hospital
ran a tox panel.

00:22:37,113 --> 00:22:38,448
Positive for GHB.

00:22:38,515 --> 00:22:39,916
Really?

00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:42,686
So this guy roofies
himself along with Kira?

00:22:42,752 --> 00:22:44,387
Did they share a drink?

00:22:44,454 --> 00:22:45,655
Well, if they did,

00:22:45,722 --> 00:22:47,157
it wasn't in anything
we tested.

00:22:47,223 --> 00:22:49,225
Hodges ran all the water
bottles and soda cans

00:22:49,292 --> 00:22:50,627
we collected
from the room--

00:22:50,694 --> 00:22:52,195
no GHB in anything.

00:22:52,262 --> 00:22:53,496
Wait a minute.

00:22:53,563 --> 00:22:56,399
I think I know
what they shared.

00:22:58,935 --> 00:23:01,137
Kira and Jordan had
unprotected sex, right?

00:23:01,204 --> 00:23:02,339
SIDLE:
Yes.

00:23:04,307 --> 00:23:06,543
That means...

00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:09,546
they both came in contact...

00:23:09,613 --> 00:23:11,681
with this.

00:23:11,748 --> 00:23:13,683
HODGES:
Kudos to you.

00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,919
The lube was indeed
laced with GHB.

00:23:15,986 --> 00:23:18,054
Not hard to do if you
know a little chemistry.

00:23:18,121 --> 00:23:20,323
Marlon takes chemistry.

00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:22,092
Hannah teaches it.

00:23:22,158 --> 00:23:24,394
We know Marlon's fingerprints
are on the lube tube.

00:23:24,461 --> 00:23:26,329
We know he was jealous.

00:23:26,396 --> 00:23:29,499
Maybe the GHB-lube was his way
of getting back at her.

00:23:29,566 --> 00:23:32,535
You know? Give a drug-free girl
a bad trip.

00:23:32,602 --> 00:23:34,938
Which became a
<i>really</i> bad trip.

00:23:35,005 --> 00:23:36,840
STOKES:
Yeah.

00:23:36,906 --> 00:23:38,008
But still, that doesn't

00:23:38,074 --> 00:23:40,277
conclusively put anybody
at the crime scene.

00:23:40,343 --> 00:23:42,879
There's one thing
we have that does.

00:23:42,946 --> 00:23:46,149
We can get a warrant for this.

00:23:47,784 --> 00:23:50,887
(sighs):
I'm telling you,
I didn't kill Kira.

00:23:50,954 --> 00:23:53,924
I've never lied to you.
Not once.

00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:55,792
You just never believe me.

00:23:55,859 --> 00:23:58,261
When I'm guilty,
you want me to be innocent.

00:23:58,328 --> 00:24:00,196
When I'm innocent,
you want me to be guilty.

00:24:00,263 --> 00:24:02,999
Hey, you know
what, Marlon?

00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:05,135
You can save it.
'Cause unlike most people,

00:24:05,201 --> 00:24:08,738
you're not going to get me
to underestimate you.

00:24:08,805 --> 00:24:12,542
I already know you're every bit
as smart as your sister,

00:24:12,609 --> 00:24:16,279
especially when it comes
to creating confusion.

00:24:16,346 --> 00:24:18,515
Open up.

00:24:20,884 --> 00:24:22,152
Bite down.

00:24:23,653 --> 00:24:25,288
Let it sit.

00:24:33,964 --> 00:24:36,900
He didn't kill Kira.
He cared about her.

00:24:36,967 --> 00:24:38,868
Hannah, what
makes you think

00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:41,237
that I would believe anything
that you tell me?

00:24:41,304 --> 00:24:43,540
I suppose I'm an optimist.

00:24:45,408 --> 00:24:48,445
College has been a difficult
adjustment for Marlon,

00:24:48,511 --> 00:24:51,648
especially after
we lost our parents.

00:24:51,715 --> 00:24:53,283
I'm sorry about that.

00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:55,352
You're not really, though.

00:24:57,087 --> 00:24:59,623
When will Marlon
be able to leave?

00:24:59,689 --> 00:25:03,360
Well, we're going to keep him
here as long as we possibly can.

00:25:04,894 --> 00:25:06,696
At least that's honest.

00:25:06,763 --> 00:25:08,698
It also seems

00:25:08,765 --> 00:25:11,034
a little vindictive.

00:25:11,101 --> 00:25:13,637
Given your brother's history,
I think it's pretty sensible.

00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:17,974
What's wrong, Sara?

00:25:18,041 --> 00:25:20,343
You're different
than you used to be.

00:25:21,711 --> 00:25:23,213
You're angry.

00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:26,082
And a little sad, too.

00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:27,617
Why?

00:25:27,684 --> 00:25:31,121
If you want to spend more time
with your brother,

00:25:31,187 --> 00:25:34,057
I recommend you invest
in a good lawyer, Hannah.

00:25:50,941 --> 00:25:52,342
(monitor beeping)

00:25:52,409 --> 00:25:54,577
It's a physical match.

00:25:54,644 --> 00:25:56,079
Puts Marlon
at the scene.

00:25:56,146 --> 00:25:58,315
That's probably not enough
to put him in jail.

00:25:58,381 --> 00:26:00,884
I think I might be able
to help you out there.

00:26:00,951 --> 00:26:05,088
I found a Friend Agenda page
for Kira and Marlon's band,

00:26:05,155 --> 00:26:06,356
The Death Crusade.

00:26:06,423 --> 00:26:08,925
Seems like a lot of pictures
for a college band.

00:26:08,992 --> 00:26:10,827
Well, TDC, as
they're called,

00:26:10,894 --> 00:26:12,829
has quite a solid
fan base on campus.

00:26:12,896 --> 00:26:15,665
SIDLE:
Hannah was there.

00:26:15,732 --> 00:26:17,500
SANDERS:
Yeah. Marlon must've
been thrilled.

00:26:17,567 --> 00:26:19,769
What guy would like
having his little sister around

00:26:19,836 --> 00:26:21,972
to watch
as he gets his ass kicked

00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:22,834
in front of his girlfriend?

00:26:22,834 --> 00:26:23,500
(camera shutter clicking)

00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,711
From now on, just stay
away from me, psycho!

00:26:25,777 --> 00:26:27,012
(hard rock playing)

00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:29,314
Marlon, Marlon,
it's okay.

00:26:29,381 --> 00:26:32,050
Kira, don't do this to me!

00:26:32,117 --> 00:26:33,952
So this new guy

00:26:34,019 --> 00:26:36,288
pops Marlon in the mouth,
chips his tooth.

00:26:36,355 --> 00:26:38,624
Marlon's humiliated,
decides to take it out on Kira.

00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:41,927
Kills her, then tries to make it
look like a suicide,

00:26:41,994 --> 00:26:44,162
and in the midst
of their struggle,

00:26:44,229 --> 00:26:47,966
his tooth fragment
ends up in her fist?

00:26:50,435 --> 00:26:52,104
What are you looking for now?

00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:54,573
I'm not sure.

00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:17,362
♪ ♪

00:27:42,321 --> 00:27:44,323
♪ ♪

00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,996
What are you doing?

00:27:51,063 --> 00:27:54,600
I'm just, uh, taking a closer
look at Marlon's chipped tooth.

00:27:54,666 --> 00:27:57,436
Look at the orientation
of the fragment in the mouth.

00:28:01,173 --> 00:28:04,743
And now look at the way
the tooth ended up
in Kira's right fist.

00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:13,085
Looks like it's backwards.

00:28:13,151 --> 00:28:14,887
I don't think
Kira punched Marlon.

00:28:14,953 --> 00:28:17,389
I think Hannah picked up
the tooth from a fight

00:28:17,456 --> 00:28:19,458
that Marlon had earlier
in the evening.

00:28:19,525 --> 00:28:22,694
And I think
she planted it on Kira.

00:28:22,761 --> 00:28:24,296
That's crazy.

00:28:24,363 --> 00:28:26,732
It's possible.

00:28:26,798 --> 00:28:29,468
This kid is spinning me
in circles again.

00:28:31,803 --> 00:28:34,172
You know, Sara, some cases,

00:28:34,239 --> 00:28:37,809
some suspects
can get under your skin.

00:28:37,876 --> 00:28:40,579
Like this tooth.

00:28:40,646 --> 00:28:43,582
But you can't let it
make you feel bad.

00:28:43,649 --> 00:28:45,584
If you want,
we can put Nick on this.

00:28:45,651 --> 00:28:48,020
No. No, I, um...

00:28:48,086 --> 00:28:51,490
I need to finish this case.

00:28:51,557 --> 00:28:53,325
I'll be okay.

00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,095
Okay.

00:29:00,966 --> 00:29:04,937
What is that
in your hand?

00:29:05,003 --> 00:29:06,939
I think it was
a gum wrapper.

00:29:07,005 --> 00:29:07,940
It's wrong to litter.

00:29:08,006 --> 00:29:10,108
It's a piece of a tooth.

00:29:10,175 --> 00:29:12,411
The one that Kira Dellinger's
new boy-toy

00:29:12,477 --> 00:29:14,313
knocked out of
Marlon's head.

00:29:20,185 --> 00:29:24,289
<i>You had already spiked</i>
<i>Kira's lube with GHB.</i>

00:29:24,356 --> 00:29:26,158
<i>All you had to do was wait.</i>

00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:32,564
<i>A piece of his tooth</i>
<i>in her fist.</i>

00:29:35,567 --> 00:29:37,369
<i>A little bit of leverage.</i>

00:29:37,436 --> 00:29:40,205
<i>And your brother's</i>
<i>a killer again.</i>

00:29:46,945 --> 00:29:50,048
That's a highly unlikely series
of events.

00:29:50,115 --> 00:29:53,318
You don't expect me to confess
to something I didn't do?

00:29:53,385 --> 00:29:56,655
I am just putting you on notice.
You are not fooling me anymore.

00:29:56,722 --> 00:30:00,392
I think I know
why you're so angry, Sara.

00:30:00,459 --> 00:30:02,494
I did some research.

00:30:02,561 --> 00:30:05,497
I read about what
that serial killer did to you

00:30:05,564 --> 00:30:06,932
out in the desert,
under that car...

00:30:06,999 --> 00:30:08,634
We're talking about you, Hannah.

00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:12,337
It must've been so terrible
being trapped like that
all alone.

00:30:12,404 --> 00:30:14,339
Did your life flash
in front of your eyes?

00:30:14,406 --> 00:30:16,842
That is none of your business.
You must've been so sad

00:30:16,909 --> 00:30:18,477
knowing that you were
gonna lose everyone

00:30:18,544 --> 00:30:20,145
who mattered
to you.
Stop it, Hannah.

00:30:20,212 --> 00:30:21,813
Look, I know how it feels.

00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,916
One moment
my parents were alive,

00:30:23,982 --> 00:30:26,251
and the next
they were gone.
Answer the question!

00:30:26,318 --> 00:30:29,755
My life changed in that moment.
All that I have left is Marlon.

00:30:29,821 --> 00:30:31,557
Why would I do
anything to hurt him?

00:30:31,623 --> 00:30:32,558
(bangs table)

00:30:33,166 --> 00:30:36,069
Stop playing games with me.

00:30:40,107 --> 00:30:42,642
You're the one
who's playing games.

00:30:45,212 --> 00:30:46,146
Hey.

00:30:46,213 --> 00:30:47,547
What are you doing here?

00:30:47,614 --> 00:30:49,583
I was going to ask you
the same question.

00:30:49,649 --> 00:30:50,984
Listen, I'm worried
about you.

00:30:51,051 --> 00:30:52,919
That just makes this worse.

00:30:52,986 --> 00:30:56,456
I-I can't talk about
this right now. I can't.

00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:09,102
(Ronnie speaking
indistinctly)

00:31:11,938 --> 00:31:14,074
Just stay in touch, okay?

00:31:15,542 --> 00:31:18,211
What happened? Her husband
attack her again?

00:31:18,278 --> 00:31:20,213
No. She came in
voluntarily.

00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:23,016
It took some convincing, but
she's agreed to go to a shelter.

00:31:23,083 --> 00:31:24,017
She won't stay.

00:31:24,084 --> 00:31:25,085
Maybe not.

00:31:25,152 --> 00:31:28,088
But at least now
she has a chance.

00:31:28,155 --> 00:31:30,524
Look, I did it all
on my own time, no OT.

00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:32,526
I know it's not the way
you do things,

00:31:32,592 --> 00:31:34,494
but I think it's
part of the job.

00:31:34,561 --> 00:31:37,731
At least, that's how
I want it to be. For me.

00:31:45,005 --> 00:31:47,274
Why would Hannah
want to frame me?

00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,443
I don't know, Marlon.

00:31:49,509 --> 00:31:51,878
She's <i>your</i> sister.

00:31:51,945 --> 00:31:53,713
Hannah's always
been kinda weird.

00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:56,283
But since the trial...
and after our parents died,

00:31:56,349 --> 00:31:57,984
she's started
getting really weird.

00:31:58,051 --> 00:31:59,553
Like how?

00:31:59,619 --> 00:32:01,455
Really clingy, I guess.

00:32:01,521 --> 00:32:03,356
Always wanting to hang
around with me.

00:32:03,423 --> 00:32:05,225
And that changed
when you met Kira?

00:32:05,292 --> 00:32:07,360
Yeah.

00:32:07,427 --> 00:32:09,229
But not for Hannah.

00:32:15,368 --> 00:32:17,471
Get out of here,
you little freak!

00:32:17,537 --> 00:32:20,140
Aren't you gonna
get her out of here?!

00:32:20,207 --> 00:32:23,176
Oh, I hope you two are really
happy together. Freaks!

00:32:23,243 --> 00:32:25,979
MARLON:
<i>After that, Kira said</i>
<i>she was done with me.</i>

00:32:26,046 --> 00:32:30,884
Marlon... don't be sad.

00:32:30,951 --> 00:32:33,320
She doesn't deserve you.

00:32:33,386 --> 00:32:36,189
You're right. She doesn't.

00:32:37,491 --> 00:32:39,793
You want to help me
teach Kira a lesson?

00:32:41,895 --> 00:32:45,766
I asked Hannah to teach me
how to make GHB,

00:32:45,832 --> 00:32:48,268
and how to get
it into Kira.

00:32:48,335 --> 00:32:50,270
I just wanted
to mess her up a bit.

00:32:50,337 --> 00:32:54,608
I snuck it into Kira's room a
few days ago; I still had a key.

00:32:54,674 --> 00:32:56,877
Hannah must've made a copy.

00:32:56,943 --> 00:32:58,578
I believe you, Marlon.

00:32:58,645 --> 00:33:00,046
I really do.

00:33:00,113 --> 00:33:02,516
But the only thing
that a jury's going to see

00:33:02,582 --> 00:33:05,118
is your prints on the lube,
your prints on the windowsill,

00:33:05,185 --> 00:33:06,586
and another dead girl.

00:33:06,653 --> 00:33:08,488
Why is Hannah
doing this to me?

00:33:08,555 --> 00:33:10,023
I don't know.

00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:11,892
All I know is...

00:33:11,958 --> 00:33:15,562
you don't deserve
to take the fall for this.

00:33:15,629 --> 00:33:18,432
And the question is...

00:33:18,498 --> 00:33:21,368
are you going to let your sister
get away with this

00:33:21,435 --> 00:33:25,472
and spend the rest
of your life in jail?

00:33:25,539 --> 00:33:28,842
If Hannah wants me in jail,
that's where I'm going to be.

00:33:28,909 --> 00:33:31,111
There's nothing
I can do about it.

00:33:32,612 --> 00:33:34,481
There is one thing.

00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:45,659
One foot away from the bars
at all times.

00:33:45,725 --> 00:33:47,861
And no contact,
you understand?

00:33:47,928 --> 00:33:50,030
Yeah, I understand.

00:33:53,233 --> 00:33:54,668
(sighs)

00:33:54,735 --> 00:33:56,336
Thanks for coming.

00:33:56,403 --> 00:33:59,139
The police said
you needed me.

00:33:59,206 --> 00:34:00,674
Yeah, I do.

00:34:00,741 --> 00:34:05,812
I need to know...
what I did to deserve this.

00:34:08,348 --> 00:34:09,950
You killed Kira.

00:34:10,016 --> 00:34:12,719
We both know I didn't do that.

00:34:16,723 --> 00:34:19,092
You look a little flushed,
Marlon.

00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:22,162
Are you feeling all right?

00:34:22,229 --> 00:34:24,531
No, I'm not feeling all right.

00:34:26,166 --> 00:34:28,935
HANNAH (over speaker):
Kira always brought out
the worst in you.

00:34:32,105 --> 00:34:35,275
Hannah, they're going to put me
away for the rest of my life.

00:34:35,342 --> 00:34:39,446
The evidence is against you,

00:34:39,513 --> 00:34:40,750
particularly given
your history of violence.

00:34:40,817 --> 00:34:42,051
Please...

00:34:42,118 --> 00:34:45,288
after everything
I've done for you,

00:34:45,355 --> 00:34:48,758
after everything we've done
for each other,

00:34:48,825 --> 00:34:51,294
at least tell me why.

00:34:54,564 --> 00:34:56,866
Because I love you.

00:35:00,203 --> 00:35:02,071
And I love you, too.

00:35:02,138 --> 00:35:05,074
No.

00:35:05,141 --> 00:35:08,144
You don't.

00:35:10,313 --> 00:35:11,814
But you will.

00:35:14,817 --> 00:35:18,321
I promise,
I'll visit you every week.

00:35:22,058 --> 00:35:23,893
We're done.

00:35:33,703 --> 00:35:35,405
(sighs):
Well, he gave it a shot,

00:35:35,471 --> 00:35:37,340
but she is way out
of his league.

00:35:37,407 --> 00:35:41,177
She's out of mine, too.

00:35:53,289 --> 00:35:54,390
Hi.

00:35:54,457 --> 00:35:57,760
Hi.

00:36:01,431 --> 00:36:03,566
Okay, what's up?

00:36:03,633 --> 00:36:05,502
I'm sorry.

00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:10,940
I've been, uh...
(cell phone ringing)

00:36:14,277 --> 00:36:16,246
This is Sara.

00:36:22,652 --> 00:36:24,587
I'll be right there.

00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:38,034
Guard found him
about an hour ago.

00:36:38,101 --> 00:36:39,736
Said he didn't
even make a sound.

00:37:10,834 --> 00:37:12,836
You need to talk
to me again?

00:37:12,902 --> 00:37:14,137
I do.

00:37:14,204 --> 00:37:18,074
I know that you killed
Kira Dellinger.

00:37:18,141 --> 00:37:20,176
I just can't prove it.

00:37:20,243 --> 00:37:23,913
That must be
frustrating for you.

00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:26,583
Hannah, Marlon's dead.

00:37:26,649 --> 00:37:29,652
Wow.

00:37:29,719 --> 00:37:35,124
That's a really sad
and desperate ploy, Sara.

00:37:35,191 --> 00:37:37,727
It's beneath you.

00:37:42,232 --> 00:37:44,667
He was doing well
here, wasn't he?

00:37:44,734 --> 00:37:47,003
Making friends,
joining a band,
falling in love.

00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:49,906
But you're still a freak,
just like high school.

00:37:49,973 --> 00:37:52,175
You're lying.
No. This is a lie.

00:37:52,242 --> 00:37:55,011
His world got bigger,
and yours stayed the same,

00:37:55,078 --> 00:37:56,412
and you killed Kira

00:37:56,479 --> 00:37:58,748
so you could keep him
all to yourself, didn't you?

00:37:58,815 --> 00:38:00,483
It's a lie!

00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:02,385
(sobbing):
No... it's a lie!

00:38:02,452 --> 00:38:03,586
It's a lie!

00:38:03,653 --> 00:38:05,688
This is a... lie!

00:38:05,755 --> 00:38:07,624
Stop it!

00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:11,294
(sobbing)

00:38:15,265 --> 00:38:17,634
(sobbing):
Marlon...

00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:21,004
he-he-he can't
leave me all alone.

Judy, have you seen Sara?

00:41:05,502 --> 00:41:07,103
She left a few minutes ago, sir,

00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:09,072
but she did leave
something for you.

00:41:11,174 --> 00:41:12,775
Thank you.

00:41:19,782 --> 00:41:21,384
SARA:

00:41:23,553 --> 00:41:26,322

00:41:30,326 --> 00:41:32,862
<i>Truth be told, I'm tired.</i>

00:41:32,929 --> 00:41:36,232
<i>Out in the desert,</i>
<i>under that car that night,</i>

00:41:36,299 --> 00:41:40,003
<i>I realized something, and I</i>

00:41:42,472 --> 00:41:45,675

00:41:49,345 --> 00:41:53,383
<i>it occurred to me that it was </i>

00:41:53,449 --> 00:41:55,585

00:41:55,652 --> 00:41:58,154
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

00:41:58,221 --> 00:42:01,324

00:42:01,391 --> 00:42:05,628

00:42:14,137 --> 00:42:18,174

00:42:18,241 --> 00:42:21,244

00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:25,215
