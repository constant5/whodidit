00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,959
(laughter)
MAN: <i>I would never</i>

00:00:04,025 --> 00:00:05,227
hit my kids.

00:00:05,293 --> 00:00:06,917
'Cause, you know,
my father used to beat me.

00:00:06,984 --> 00:00:08,485
Whatever. He didn't beat me
too much.

00:00:08,552 --> 00:00:10,187
He beat me just right.

00:00:10,254 --> 00:00:13,157
I remember the last time
he really slapped me around

00:00:13,223 --> 00:00:14,925
just getting up off the ground
and thinking...

00:00:14,992 --> 00:00:16,927
perfect.

00:00:16,994 --> 00:00:18,362
He really nailed it,
you know just...

00:00:18,429 --> 00:00:20,764
Any more would have been
barbaric.

00:00:20,831 --> 00:00:22,132
And yet any less,

00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:24,201
I wouldn't be seeking
the approval of you drunks.

00:00:24,268 --> 00:00:25,769
So, thanks, Dad.

00:00:25,836 --> 00:00:27,838
'Cause parenting is hard
and expense.

00:00:27,905 --> 00:00:30,874
I just read the other day
if you were to have a baby today

00:00:30,941 --> 00:00:32,910
and raise that kid all the way
through college,

00:00:32,976 --> 00:00:35,846
it would cost you $1 million.

00:00:35,913 --> 00:00:38,749
And that's why I feel like
no woman should ever walk out

00:00:38,816 --> 00:00:41,018
of an abortion clinic with her
head hung down in shame.

00:00:41,085 --> 00:00:43,454
You walk out and they're like
you just hit the lotto.

00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,055
I'm a winner!

00:00:45,122 --> 00:00:46,757
MAN:
You suck!

00:00:48,325 --> 00:00:49,426
You think abortion's funny?

00:00:49,493 --> 00:00:51,428
Hey, come on.

00:00:51,495 --> 00:00:53,263
I don't think abortion's funny.

00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:55,599
Especially the ones that try
too hard to get a laugh.

00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:57,901
You know what I mean?

00:00:57,968 --> 00:00:59,503
You'd know about that
wouldn't you?

00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:00,738
Sir,

00:01:00,804 --> 00:01:02,206
do you have kids?

00:01:02,272 --> 00:01:03,273
That's none
of your damn business.

00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:04,375
I'm trying to connect, sir.

00:01:04,441 --> 00:01:06,443
I-I feel like we got off
on the wrong foot.

00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:07,811
I hate to see that.

00:01:07,878 --> 00:01:09,246
Let me make it up to you.

00:01:09,313 --> 00:01:10,481
Let me baby-sit next week.

00:01:10,547 --> 00:01:12,316
(audience laughs)
Come on.

00:01:12,383 --> 00:01:14,652
Seriously. I love kids.

00:01:14,718 --> 00:01:15,886
Did you hug your kid today?

00:01:15,953 --> 00:01:17,888
Can I hug your kid?
Can I hug your kid, sir?

00:01:17,955 --> 00:01:20,624
You touch my kids, I kill you.

00:01:20,691 --> 00:01:23,127
Dude, it's a comedy show.

00:01:23,193 --> 00:01:24,461
I'm kidding.

00:01:24,528 --> 00:01:26,163
This is a joke.

00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:27,464
(audience oohs)

00:01:27,531 --> 00:01:28,999
What? What was that?

00:01:29,066 --> 00:01:31,735
Oh, I see why you're so angry.

00:01:31,802 --> 00:01:33,570
That's your wife.

00:01:33,637 --> 00:01:34,605
Whoo!

00:01:34,672 --> 00:01:36,440
Hey, baby.

00:01:36,507 --> 00:01:38,108
The kids asleep?

00:01:38,175 --> 00:01:39,977
How's Katie's stomach?

00:01:40,044 --> 00:01:41,979
Do you need anything?

00:01:42,046 --> 00:01:44,682
Okay, all right, I'll see you
in like 15 minutes.

00:01:44,748 --> 00:01:46,417
(engine revving)
All right. Love you.

00:01:46,483 --> 00:01:48,018
(tires squealing)

00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:08,372
Hey man, you were great!

00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:10,341
Thanks.
No, no,

00:02:10,407 --> 00:02:11,508
I mean it, man.

00:02:11,575 --> 00:02:13,277
I was laughing my ass off.

00:02:13,344 --> 00:02:15,379
Anybody finds a size 54 ass,

00:02:15,446 --> 00:02:18,115
I'll make sure we keep it
on ice for you.

00:02:18,182 --> 00:02:20,184
(laughing):
He said 54...

00:02:25,522 --> 00:02:28,459
(car alarm blaring)

00:02:28,525 --> 00:02:30,527
(alarm chirps)

00:02:35,699 --> 00:02:37,668
(sighs)

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,683
(garbled radio transmission)

00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,454
I'll put up some screens.

00:02:57,521 --> 00:02:58,622
Don't bother.

00:02:58,689 --> 00:03:00,691
I'm going to take it
back intact.

No rigor present.

00:04:34,261 --> 00:04:36,597
TOD is probably less
than 12 hours ago.

00:04:41,769 --> 00:04:43,771
Victim is a female child,

00:04:43,837 --> 00:04:46,740
Caucasian,
approximately

00:04:46,807 --> 00:04:49,410
three to four
years old,

00:04:49,476 --> 00:04:52,780
and she was found
in a packing box

00:04:52,846 --> 00:04:54,915
in a parking lot
at the intersection

00:04:54,982 --> 00:04:56,650
of Cordelia
and Tamsin Streets.

00:04:57,684 --> 00:05:00,587
The box

00:05:00,654 --> 00:05:03,624
appears to be in
good condition,

00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:06,460
and shows no indications

00:05:06,527 --> 00:05:09,063
that the child struggled,

00:05:09,129 --> 00:05:11,298
which may suggest

00:05:11,365 --> 00:05:13,634
that she was unconscious
or even dead

00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,703
at the time she was placed
inside the box.

00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:22,476
ALS reveals no blood

00:05:22,543 --> 00:05:25,546
or bodily fluids on the box.

00:05:38,859 --> 00:05:41,128
There are
multiple hairs

00:05:41,195 --> 00:05:43,430
embedded in the packing tape.

00:05:48,135 --> 00:05:51,105
There is a viscous residue
on the underside

00:05:51,171 --> 00:05:53,173
of the box.

00:05:59,379 --> 00:06:02,116
The guy who found the box
said he's sure it wasn't here

00:06:02,182 --> 00:06:04,184
when he arrived
to do his set.

00:06:06,053 --> 00:06:07,654
You know it's
too bad

00:06:07,721 --> 00:06:10,057
that there's no exterior
surveillance cameras

00:06:10,124 --> 00:06:12,059
on any of the businesses here.
Mm-hmm.

00:06:12,126 --> 00:06:14,728
No skid marks,

00:06:14,795 --> 00:06:16,997
which means the box
was probably placed,

00:06:17,064 --> 00:06:19,333
instead of being tossed out
of a moving vehicle.

00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,336
Most likely
someone on foot.

00:06:22,403 --> 00:06:24,338
There's got to be hundreds
of shoe prints

00:06:24,405 --> 00:06:26,006
crisscrossing
this lot.

00:06:26,073 --> 00:06:27,674
Yeah.

00:06:27,741 --> 00:06:29,843
I better get started.

00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:32,045
(reporters clamoring)

00:06:39,787 --> 00:06:42,856
All right, all right, okay.

00:06:42,923 --> 00:06:45,459
This is an ongoing
investigation,

00:06:45,526 --> 00:06:49,163
we're not giving out any more
details at this time.

00:06:49,229 --> 00:06:53,333
All we're asking is anyone with
any information about this girl,

00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,669
to please come forward
and contact the authorities.

00:06:55,736 --> 00:06:57,337
(clamoring continues)
Let...

00:06:57,404 --> 00:07:00,340
I'll answer the questions,
but one at a time, all right?

00:07:00,407 --> 00:07:01,508
Okay.

00:07:01,575 --> 00:07:03,410
Has anyone claimed
responsibility?

00:07:03,477 --> 00:07:04,478
No.

00:07:04,545 --> 00:07:05,646
REPORTER:
How old is the baby?

00:07:05,712 --> 00:07:07,481
Are you offering
any reward?

00:07:07,548 --> 00:07:10,451
BRASS:
<i>No. Not at this time.</i>

00:07:11,485 --> 00:07:13,887
She's got abrasions

00:07:13,954 --> 00:07:15,956
on the knuckles of both hands.

00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:19,593
Reddish blisters

00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:22,329
on both palms,

00:07:22,396 --> 00:07:24,331
and on her legs

00:07:24,398 --> 00:07:26,600
and buttocks.

00:07:26,667 --> 00:07:27,901
Bruises on her back,

00:07:27,968 --> 00:07:30,370
arms...

00:07:31,405 --> 00:07:33,841
...and base of
the skull.

00:07:33,907 --> 00:07:35,242
<i>Is there anything</i>
<i>you could tell us</i>

00:07:35,309 --> 00:07:36,543
about the cause of death?
Come on,

00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:39,546
like I said, this is an ongoing
police investigation.

00:07:39,613 --> 00:07:41,048
(clamoring continues)

00:07:41,115 --> 00:07:43,250
I'm not going to comment
about that.
But do you suspect

00:07:43,317 --> 00:07:45,085
foul play?
She was found dead

00:07:45,152 --> 00:07:46,887
in a box in a parking lot.

00:07:46,954 --> 00:07:48,956
Draw your own conclusions.

00:08:04,638 --> 00:08:08,575
COD is atlanto-occipital
disarticulation,

00:08:08,642 --> 00:08:11,245
consistent with a single
blunt force trauma

00:08:11,311 --> 00:08:13,247
to the back
of the head.

00:08:13,313 --> 00:08:15,749
Any signs of
sexual trauma?

00:08:15,816 --> 00:08:17,151
No.

00:08:17,217 --> 00:08:19,586
Trace is running
the samples,

00:08:19,653 --> 00:08:21,789
but these burns are
most likely chemical.

00:08:21,855 --> 00:08:24,491
There's blistering in
the nasal passages

00:08:24,558 --> 00:08:26,326
and esophagus,
which indicates

00:08:26,393 --> 00:08:28,562
inhalation
of caustic fumes.

00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:32,299
There's four-and-one
bruising on both arms.

00:08:33,367 --> 00:08:36,470
Any indication
of previous breaks

00:08:36,537 --> 00:08:38,138
or healed injuries?

00:08:38,205 --> 00:08:41,842
Nothing to suggest a history
of prior abuse.

00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:44,611
Well, you don't need practice
to kill a kid.

00:08:55,723 --> 00:08:57,157
You got something?

00:08:57,224 --> 00:08:58,759
Jude.

00:08:58,826 --> 00:09:00,294
Patron saint
of the desperate.

00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,041
Yeah.

00:09:01,108 --> 00:09:02,743
He's got an alibi.

00:09:05,946 --> 00:09:07,815
Who abuses

00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,850
and murders a child

00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:12,019
and then tenderly
wraps them

00:09:12,086 --> 00:09:15,456
in a blanket and leaves them
in a parking lot?

00:09:15,522 --> 00:09:18,659
The disposition of the body
suggests contrition.

00:09:18,726 --> 00:09:21,128
Or remorse even.

00:09:21,195 --> 00:09:23,197
A kidnapping
gone wrong?

00:09:23,264 --> 00:09:25,900
Except, if she'd been taken, the
parents would have come forward.

00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:27,568
Not necessarily.

00:09:27,635 --> 00:09:29,570
Maybe she was taken
a while ago.

00:09:29,637 --> 00:09:31,572
Grabbed somewhere else,
dumped here.

00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:34,408
Maybe her parents have stopped
looking for her.

00:09:34,475 --> 00:09:37,578
Unless the parents are involved.

00:09:37,645 --> 00:09:41,649
Abusive husband kills daughter,

00:09:41,715 --> 00:09:45,819
guilt-stricken wife gives
her a "decent" burial.

00:09:45,886 --> 00:09:48,522
Or maybe the
killer's just

00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:51,525
sticking his thumb in God's eye.

00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:53,193
Or practicing to
be a mortician.

00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,395
Or...

00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:56,230
Got your chemical
burn agent:

00:09:56,297 --> 00:09:58,399
it's sodium hydroxide

00:09:58,465 --> 00:10:00,401
with traces of machined
aluminum shards.

00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:02,570
Household drain
cleaner.

00:10:02,636 --> 00:10:05,439
The powdered hydroxide
reacts with water

00:10:05,506 --> 00:10:07,007
to generate near-boiling
temperatures,

00:10:07,074 --> 00:10:09,043
which in turn
churns up the shards

00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:12,613
which cut the hair and the gunk
to help break up the clog.

00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,682
WILLOWS:
And it burns like hell

00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:17,084
if it even touches
your skin.

00:10:17,151 --> 00:10:19,553
It's hard to believe that
anybody could do something

00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,189
like this to such
a beautiful little girl.

00:10:22,256 --> 00:10:25,659
So, if she had been
plain or homely,

00:10:25,726 --> 00:10:27,394
it'd be easy for
you to accept?

00:10:28,796 --> 00:10:30,731
No.

00:10:30,798 --> 00:10:32,700
But, uh,

00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:34,802
maybe it's just me,

00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:36,470
that when something
like this happens

00:10:36,537 --> 00:10:39,006
to a kid with a face
like that, it...

00:10:39,073 --> 00:10:42,042
just seems a little
more tragic.

00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:45,312
Maybe that'll work
in our favor.

00:10:51,352 --> 00:10:53,220
Did I just piss her off?

00:10:53,287 --> 00:10:54,888
Yeah.

00:10:54,955 --> 00:10:57,057
But she was heading that way
when she came in.

The vic's blonde hair

00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,083
has a very short,
dark root.

00:13:02,484 --> 00:13:04,186
The baby's not a natural blonde.

The undyed portion

00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:12,894
of the hair shaft
is 0.90 millimeters.

00:13:12,961 --> 00:13:14,196

00:13:14,262 --> 00:13:15,597
Well...
Wendy?

00:13:17,132 --> 00:13:19,134
Well... human hair grows

00:13:19,201 --> 00:13:21,336
at an average rate
of half a millimeter a day,

00:13:21,403 --> 00:13:24,906
with a slight deviation
for age and for health.

00:13:24,973 --> 00:13:27,843
So based on the length
of that hair root,

00:13:27,909 --> 00:13:29,711
I would say that her hair
was probably dyed

00:13:29,778 --> 00:13:32,447

right down the crapper.

neighborhood I've moved into.

cleaner came out of.

even know who you are.

00:22:17,311 --> 00:22:19,680
Please, please... You're not
going to tell her, are you?

00:22:19,747 --> 00:22:21,849
Let's say that ship's
already sailed.

00:22:24,318 --> 00:22:25,953
Put him in the tank.

00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:30,291
You've never...
done anything you've regretted?

00:22:30,358 --> 00:22:32,860
More than there are stars
in the sky.

00:22:32,927 --> 00:22:34,996
Good-bye, Leo.

00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:42,470
SANDERS:
This is Leo Finley's apartment,

00:22:42,537 --> 00:22:43,638
where he claims
he threw away the box;

00:22:43,704 --> 00:22:46,374
which, somehow ended up
three blocks north

00:22:46,441 --> 00:22:48,676
and two blocks east--
with Baby Cordelia dead in it.

00:22:48,743 --> 00:22:50,578
Do you really believe
he killed the girl

00:22:50,645 --> 00:22:54,348
and carried her five blocks
before dumping the body?

00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:56,884
In that neighborhood, who would
notice a guy carrying a box?

00:22:56,951 --> 00:22:59,087
Leo Finley was never even
charged with child molestation,

00:22:59,153 --> 00:23:00,688
let alone abuse.

00:23:00,755 --> 00:23:02,290
WILLOWS:
Sex offenders escalate.

00:23:02,356 --> 00:23:04,959
GRISSOM:
He has a reasonable
explanation why his hairs

00:23:05,026 --> 00:23:06,260
were in the box,

00:23:06,327 --> 00:23:08,329
and there was no evidence
of the victim

00:23:08,396 --> 00:23:09,897
at either
of his residences.

00:23:09,964 --> 00:23:11,632
I know.

00:23:11,699 --> 00:23:13,868
So why is he still in custody?

00:23:13,935 --> 00:23:16,637
Because he lied to us before,
and he's still lying now.

00:23:16,704 --> 00:23:18,306
HODGES:
<i>Analysis of the oily residue</i>

00:23:18,372 --> 00:23:20,842
from the cardboard box.

00:23:20,908 --> 00:23:22,110
It's oil.

00:23:22,176 --> 00:23:24,378
Yeah, mostly 10-W-40,
transmission fluid,

00:23:24,445 --> 00:23:25,875
a little bit of axle grease
and some dirt mixed in.

00:23:25,942 --> 00:23:28,311
Well, that could be from any
parking lot or street in town.

00:23:28,378 --> 00:23:31,814
Yeah, but site-specific
impurity levels could
narrow that down a bit.

00:23:31,881 --> 00:23:34,817
Let me know if you find
any suspicious oil slicks.

00:23:34,884 --> 00:23:37,120
♪ ♪

00:24:02,612 --> 00:24:04,314
Excuse me.

00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,916
Sir?

00:24:06,983 --> 00:24:08,751
How you doing?

00:24:08,818 --> 00:24:09,953
My name's Nick Stokes.

00:24:10,019 --> 00:24:11,921
I'm with the Las Vegas
Crime Lab.

00:24:11,988 --> 00:24:13,523
You mind if I ask you
a few questions?

00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:15,592
I'm innocent.

00:24:15,658 --> 00:24:17,894
Do you, uh,
recognize this?

00:24:17,961 --> 00:24:20,363
I see all kind of boxes, son.

00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:23,099
How about this guy?
Do you recognize him?

00:24:26,236 --> 00:24:28,738
I see what you driving at.

00:24:28,805 --> 00:24:31,674
This fellow brought a busted
cylinder head in here

00:24:31,741 --> 00:24:32,942
in that box, to be fixed.

00:24:33,009 --> 00:24:34,510
One of them get-
the-job-half-done-

00:24:34,577 --> 00:24:37,380
then-bring-it-in-here-for-
me-to-fix-it kind of guys.

00:24:37,447 --> 00:24:38,381
You know the type?

00:24:38,448 --> 00:24:40,083
Thinks he good with tools.

00:24:40,149 --> 00:24:42,952
Hopeless.
Like a woman.

00:24:43,019 --> 00:24:44,554
Worse than a woman,
a woman you might expect...

00:24:44,621 --> 00:24:47,690
Do you remember what you did
with the box?

00:24:47,757 --> 00:24:49,525
I took the part, he
tossed the box outside.

00:24:49,592 --> 00:24:52,862
I got the paperwork
inside.

00:24:52,929 --> 00:24:55,298
(sighs)

00:25:01,671 --> 00:25:03,873
He came in
last Thursday.

00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:07,210
Guy's name is, uh...
Dean James.

00:25:07,277 --> 00:25:09,245
Hey, that's like, uh,
like James Dean...

00:25:09,312 --> 00:25:10,213
Only it's backwards.

00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,949
Yeah, right, we know.
Thanks, man.

00:25:13,016 --> 00:25:15,251
Okay, yeah, I didn't throw
the box out.

00:25:15,318 --> 00:25:17,887
I used it to take an engine part
to my mechanic. Okay?

00:25:17,954 --> 00:25:19,222
Why did you lie, Leo?

00:25:19,289 --> 00:25:21,125
Because I saw the thing
on the TV.

00:25:21,192 --> 00:25:23,394
It was you, in fact, saying
about how they found

00:25:23,461 --> 00:25:24,695
that dead kid out back there,

00:25:24,762 --> 00:25:26,097
and I-I thought you wouldn't
believe me

00:25:26,163 --> 00:25:28,199
if I told you I took the box
so close to the scene.

00:25:28,265 --> 00:25:29,333
You lied to us, Leo,

00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,303
and now you're changing
your story... again.

00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:34,171
What is it with you
and the truth, Leo?

00:25:34,238 --> 00:25:35,573
Look, I swear to God...

00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,376
And now we have both you
and the box

00:25:38,442 --> 00:25:39,777
within a hundred yards
of the scene

00:25:39,844 --> 00:25:41,646
on the night it happened.

00:25:41,712 --> 00:25:44,081
How do you think
that makes us feel?

00:25:44,148 --> 00:25:46,250
I... I used it
to take a part in.

00:25:46,317 --> 00:25:48,686
Talk to my mechanic.

00:25:48,753 --> 00:25:49,954
He'll tell you.

00:25:50,021 --> 00:25:51,088
We already have.

00:25:51,155 --> 00:25:52,857
So... what?
You think I...

00:25:52,923 --> 00:25:55,059
You think I brought the part in
and then...

00:25:55,126 --> 00:25:57,328
came back later and put
the little girl in the box?

00:25:57,395 --> 00:25:58,763
Does that make sense to you?

00:25:58,829 --> 00:26:00,998
What makes sense to me,
what doesn't make sense to me

00:26:01,065 --> 00:26:02,466
is none of your business.

00:26:02,533 --> 00:26:04,035
But I will tell you this:

00:26:04,101 --> 00:26:05,503
Every time I turn around,

00:26:05,569 --> 00:26:06,537
you get closer and closer
to the scene.

00:26:06,604 --> 00:26:09,473
Why is that, Leo?

00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,841
I don't know.

00:26:10,908 --> 00:26:12,276
Coincidence?

00:26:12,343 --> 00:26:15,246
So what's it going to be
next time?

00:26:15,313 --> 00:26:18,115
That... no,
that's the whole story.

00:26:18,182 --> 00:26:20,418
There's not going to be
a next time.

00:26:25,089 --> 00:26:27,158
Las Vegas police have exhausted
the few leads

00:26:27,224 --> 00:26:29,961
they had in the tragic case
of Baby Cordelia Doe;

00:26:30,027 --> 00:26:32,897
yet her identity and the
circumstances of her death

00:26:32,964 --> 00:26:35,066
remain a mystery.

00:26:35,132 --> 00:26:36,867
But desperate to find out
who she is

00:26:36,934 --> 00:26:40,304
and who killed her, forensic
experts have reconstructed

00:26:40,371 --> 00:26:41,872
the little girl's appearance

00:26:41,939 --> 00:26:43,774
as she would've looked
before she was murdered

00:26:43,841 --> 00:26:45,610
and left for dead.

00:26:45,676 --> 00:26:47,144
They're hoping the image
will look enough

00:26:47,211 --> 00:26:50,448
like the real girl to shake
loose someone's memory...

00:26:50,514 --> 00:26:52,917
That's my baby!

00:26:52,984 --> 00:26:56,053
(indistinct shouting)

00:27:03,761 --> 00:27:05,796
(yelling)

00:27:05,863 --> 00:27:07,698
That's my daughter!
That's my daughter!

00:27:07,765 --> 00:27:08,866
Get back!

00:27:08,933 --> 00:27:11,435
(screaming)

00:27:11,502 --> 00:27:14,472
(indistinct announcement
over PA)

00:27:23,347 --> 00:27:26,117
That's Inez.

00:27:26,183 --> 00:27:29,654
That is-is... my little girl.

00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:33,257
I wasn't there 
to protect her.

00:27:33,324 --> 00:27:37,895
You guys put her
in the ground yet?

00:27:37,962 --> 00:27:40,264
Not yet.

00:27:40,331 --> 00:27:42,433
I would like to go
to the funeral.

00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,936
We might be able
to arrange that.
Yeah.

00:27:47,338 --> 00:27:51,108
Do you know anyone
who wanted to harm her?

00:27:51,175 --> 00:27:54,946
Yeah... I know exactly
who did it.

00:27:55,012 --> 00:27:58,516
<i>It's the guy I used to share</i>
<i>my cell with-- Boyd Waldrip.</i>

00:27:58,582 --> 00:28:03,287
<i>I told him about my wife Grace,</i>
<i>what a good woman she was</i>

00:28:03,354 --> 00:28:06,190
<i>and how lucky I was</i>
<i>to have her.</i>

00:28:06,257 --> 00:28:10,027
<i>When Boyd got out,</i>

00:28:10,094 --> 00:28:13,764
I asked him to look
in on Grace and Inez...

00:28:13,831 --> 00:28:17,335
to take care of them
if they needed anything.

00:28:17,401 --> 00:28:20,371
He took care
of her all right.

00:28:20,438 --> 00:28:23,174
The bitch filed for divorce,
and...

00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,575
then she married Boyd.

00:28:26,611 --> 00:28:29,714
How could I have been so stupid?

00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:32,783
He killed Inez.

00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:34,251
He killed...

00:28:34,318 --> 00:28:38,222
(sobbing):
my little baby girl. He...

00:28:38,289 --> 00:28:39,757
Why would he do that?

00:28:39,824 --> 00:28:42,059
I don't know.

00:28:42,126 --> 00:28:44,895
Maybe he did not want my face
staring up at him

00:28:44,962 --> 00:28:49,000
every morning, reminding him
what a piece of crap he was.

00:28:49,066 --> 00:28:50,301
Well, if he killed
your daughter,

00:28:50,368 --> 00:28:51,669
why didn't your wife
come forward?

00:28:51,736 --> 00:28:54,372
Maybe she's... dead, too.

00:28:54,438 --> 00:28:58,576
Maybe he killed her, too.

00:28:58,643 --> 00:29:01,712
When, uh, you guys
find him,

00:29:01,779 --> 00:29:03,914
will you send him
back down here?

00:29:03,981 --> 00:29:06,584
And then we'll save the state
a lot of money on him.

00:29:06,651 --> 00:29:07,985
(sirens wailing)

00:29:08,052 --> 00:29:10,721
(tires screeching)

00:29:10,788 --> 00:29:12,923

00:29:19,096 --> 00:29:21,766
LVPD! Open up!

00:29:25,169 --> 00:29:26,437

Clear!

(cartoons playing on TV)

00:29:28,739 --> 00:29:32,076
DISPATCH:
Attention all officers,
attempt to locate white male,

00:29:32,143 --> 00:29:34,512
Boyd Waldrip, possibly
in the company of his wife,

00:29:34,578 --> 00:29:36,280
white female, Grace Waldrip

00:29:36,347 --> 00:29:39,617
and/or two young children,
descriptions to follow.

00:29:39,684 --> 00:29:42,720
Suspect's vehicle of record is
a yellow '78 Mercury Zephyr.

00:29:42,787 --> 00:29:47,124
Nevada tags: Zebra, George,
Nora, Paul, Three, Nine, Zero...

00:29:56,634 --> 00:29:58,769
Apparently when Waldrip got out,
he gained custody

00:29:58,836 --> 00:30:00,938
of his two kids
from a former marriage.

00:30:01,005 --> 00:30:03,641
First wife died of hepatitis
while he was inside.

00:30:03,708 --> 00:30:06,110
Maybe Inez's mother dyed
her hair

00:30:06,177 --> 00:30:09,413
so she'd fit in better
with her new siblings.

00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,715
Or else she was trying to make

00:30:10,781 --> 00:30:13,017
Inez look less like
her real father?

00:30:13,084 --> 00:30:15,319
To protect her?

00:30:18,522 --> 00:30:22,126
TV's still on, food
left on the table.

00:30:22,193 --> 00:30:24,362
They left in a hurry.

00:30:38,009 --> 00:30:40,211
(Willows coughs)

00:30:43,681 --> 00:30:45,149

00:30:58,262 --> 00:31:00,631

ANCHORWOMAN:
<i>Tonight we have</i>
<i>new developments</i>

00:31:26,791 --> 00:31:28,426
<i>in the tragic death</i>
<i>of Inez Balboa,</i>

00:31:28,492 --> 00:31:29,727
<i>the child we've come to know</i>

00:31:29,794 --> 00:31:31,862
as Baby Cordelia Doe.

00:31:31,929 --> 00:31:34,799
Authorities are currently
engaged in a statewide manhunt

00:31:34,865 --> 00:31:37,168
for the child's mother
and stepfather...

00:31:37,234 --> 00:31:38,703
If they're traveling
with their kids,

00:31:38,769 --> 00:31:40,304
they might be looking
for a place

00:31:40,371 --> 00:31:41,973
to leave them for awhile.

00:31:42,039 --> 00:31:43,808
Well, Waldrip has a sister
in Modesto,

00:31:43,874 --> 00:31:45,610
and Grace's mother lives
in Salt Lake City.

00:31:45,676 --> 00:31:47,712
We staked out both
of their residences.

00:31:47,778 --> 00:31:50,648
NHP is patrolling all the major
roads leading to them.

00:31:50,715 --> 00:31:52,249
(phone rings)
Hold on a minute.

00:31:52,316 --> 00:31:53,584
Brass.

00:31:53,651 --> 00:31:55,519
I'm on my way.

00:31:55,586 --> 00:31:57,755
We got 'em.

00:32:01,292 --> 00:32:04,261
(robot whirring)

00:32:09,967 --> 00:32:11,769
OFFICER 1 (over bullhorn):
Boyd, listen!

00:32:11,836 --> 00:32:13,671
Let's find a way out of this.

00:32:13,738 --> 00:32:18,209
We've got to deal with the
safety of your kids first.

00:32:18,276 --> 00:32:19,677
OFFICER 2: We got
a hostage situation.

00:32:19,744 --> 00:32:21,112
A customer ID'd 'em
in there eating.

00:32:21,178 --> 00:32:22,546
They called the locals,

00:32:22,613 --> 00:32:24,682
but he burned us
and opened fire.
BRASS:
Anybody hit?

00:32:24,749 --> 00:32:26,817
I'm not sure. We got him
locked down there

00:32:26,884 --> 00:32:28,052
with his family
and some customers.

00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:29,787
How many inside?
I don't know.

00:32:29,854 --> 00:32:32,657
OFFICER 1:
Nobody's been hurt yet;
nobody's gonna get hurt.

00:32:32,723 --> 00:32:33,958
That's the idea.

00:32:34,025 --> 00:32:36,560
That's the most important thing
right now, okay?

00:32:38,329 --> 00:32:40,698
Raise that camera higher.

00:32:40,765 --> 00:32:42,733
(robot whirring)

00:32:46,771 --> 00:32:49,373
OFFICER (over bullhorn):
So why don't you work
with me here?

00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,275
Let's ease the kids out of this.

00:32:53,344 --> 00:32:55,279
BOYD:
Okay!

00:32:55,346 --> 00:32:56,547
Okay, I'm going to let
the kids out.

00:32:56,614 --> 00:32:57,782
Just put your weapons down.

00:32:57,848 --> 00:32:59,417
You got it, Boyd.

00:32:59,483 --> 00:33:00,651
Nice and easy.

00:33:00,718 --> 00:33:02,420
(indistinct radio transmission)

00:33:02,486 --> 00:33:04,422
BOYD:
You're all right.
You're okay.

00:33:04,488 --> 00:33:06,490
(Boyd grunts and mumbles)

00:33:09,226 --> 00:33:11,329
Go.

00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,835
Come here, kids.
Come on.

00:33:17,902 --> 00:33:20,438
NEGOTIATOR:
Let's get everyone else
out you got in there.

00:33:20,504 --> 00:33:24,108
They didn't do
anything, Boyd.

00:33:24,175 --> 00:33:26,077
You got
to let them out, too.

00:33:26,143 --> 00:33:29,413
Work with me
here, Boyd.

00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:32,617
We're gonna
work it out.

00:33:35,186 --> 00:33:37,088
BOYD:
All right, let's go.

00:33:37,154 --> 00:33:38,356
Come on, you guys go first.

00:33:38,422 --> 00:33:39,557
Let's go. Let's go.

00:33:39,624 --> 00:33:40,825
Come on, come on, come on!

00:33:40,891 --> 00:33:42,093
I'm letting you go.
Come on...

00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:43,527
They're coming out!

00:33:43,594 --> 00:33:45,596
BOYD:
Nice and easy.

00:33:45,663 --> 00:33:46,998
(garbled radio transmission)

00:33:47,064 --> 00:33:48,499
Go, go. Move,
move, move, move!

00:33:48,566 --> 00:33:50,034
NEGOTIATOR:
All right, let's see this

00:33:50,101 --> 00:33:52,303
through to the end.

00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:54,372
Now, you've got a choice.

00:33:54,438 --> 00:33:56,507
You both can
come out together,

00:33:56,574 --> 00:33:59,844
or you can send your
wife ahead of you.

00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:01,178
BOYD:
Come on, you got to go.

00:34:01,245 --> 00:34:02,346
GRACE:
No! No!

00:34:02,413 --> 00:34:03,714
Come on. Listen to me.

00:34:03,781 --> 00:34:06,284
Don't argue.
You got to go.

00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:07,918
BOYD:
You're going.
No.

00:34:07,985 --> 00:34:09,687
Go, go, go.
I don't want

00:34:09,754 --> 00:34:10,788
to go without you!
Just go!

00:34:10,855 --> 00:34:12,723
Don't argue
with me.

00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:14,892
Hold you fire! Hold your fire!

00:34:14,959 --> 00:34:17,028
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!

00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:21,065
(screaming)

00:34:21,132 --> 00:34:23,668
No!

00:34:28,072 --> 00:34:29,130
BRASS:
So you beat Inez,

00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:30,899
then you locked her
under the sink.

00:34:30,965 --> 00:34:34,402
If you say I killed Inez,
that must have been how it was.

00:34:34,469 --> 00:34:37,238
You know, however you want
it put, that's fine with me.

00:34:37,305 --> 00:34:38,840
BRASS:
Oh.

00:34:38,907 --> 00:34:41,371
I-I'm just... I'm just trying
to do you justice here, Boyd.

00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:42,839
Just write it out,

00:34:42,906 --> 00:34:45,475
and I'll sign it.

00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:47,177
So, you're waiving your right
to counsel?

00:34:47,244 --> 00:34:48,545
I don't need no lawyer.

00:34:48,612 --> 00:34:49,780
It's over.

00:34:49,846 --> 00:34:51,615
Can we just get this thing done?

00:34:51,682 --> 00:34:53,183
All right.

00:34:55,185 --> 00:34:57,180
I want
my daddy!
Okay, come on.

00:34:57,246 --> 00:34:59,556
Just leave him alone!
Come with me now!

00:34:59,622 --> 00:35:01,558
I want my daddy!
He wants his daddy!

00:35:01,624 --> 00:35:02,264
It'll be okay.
Excuse me?

00:35:02,331 --> 00:35:04,633
Could you give me a minute
with them, please?

00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,668
Thank you.

00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:10,472
It's going
to be okay.

00:35:10,539 --> 00:35:12,474
But you got
to be brave.

00:35:12,541 --> 00:35:14,710
Can you do that?

00:35:14,776 --> 00:35:16,812
Is this because of us?

00:35:16,878 --> 00:35:18,113
No, no.

00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,748
No, it's not because of you.

00:35:19,815 --> 00:35:22,217
Is it because
of what happened to Inez?

00:35:22,284 --> 00:35:23,952
What do you think
happened to her?

00:35:24,019 --> 00:35:26,755
We were playing a game.

00:35:26,822 --> 00:35:28,090
(Faith cries)
A game?

00:35:28,156 --> 00:35:29,591
Hide and seek.

00:35:29,658 --> 00:35:32,094
Hide and seek?

00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,630
Dad was asleep on the couch.

00:35:36,164 --> 00:35:38,467
You said that you were playing
hide and seek?

00:35:38,533 --> 00:35:40,268
He was it.

00:35:40,335 --> 00:35:42,738
He found me right away, but...

00:35:42,804 --> 00:35:44,940
but Inez won.

00:35:45,007 --> 00:35:46,908
(Faith crying)

00:35:46,975 --> 00:35:51,346
I showed her the best hiding
place in the whole house.

00:35:51,413 --> 00:35:54,883
Four, five, six,

00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:57,285
seven, eight,

00:35:57,352 --> 00:35:59,688
nine, ten, 11.

00:35:59,755 --> 00:36:02,624
12, 13...

00:36:11,633 --> 00:36:14,803
Did your dad tell you
to say this?

00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:17,906
No. You're not supposed
to wake Dad when he's sleeping

00:36:17,973 --> 00:36:20,042
because he gets tired a lot.

00:36:20,108 --> 00:36:22,110
(Faith sniffles)

00:36:29,217 --> 00:36:31,219
(sighs)

00:36:33,522 --> 00:36:35,624
Why don't you tell me
what really happened?

00:36:37,693 --> 00:36:39,494
You got my confession.

00:36:39,561 --> 00:36:42,664
Yes, but I don't believe
that's what happened anymore.

00:36:42,731 --> 00:36:44,166
(sighs)

00:36:44,232 --> 00:36:46,735
I told you, that's how it was.

00:36:46,802 --> 00:36:50,072
Your kids are telling me
something different.

00:36:52,107 --> 00:36:53,875
It was an accident,
wasn't it, Boyd?

00:36:53,942 --> 00:36:55,344
All right,
think about this.

00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:56,712
Think about
your children.

00:36:56,778 --> 00:37:00,015
What would their lives be like

00:37:00,082 --> 00:37:02,117
with everyone believing

00:37:02,184 --> 00:37:04,186
that their father's a killer?

00:37:10,425 --> 00:37:12,761
I came home from work
like I always do,

00:37:12,828 --> 00:37:16,098
fell asleep on the couch,
waiting for Grace to get home.

00:37:26,975 --> 00:37:29,111
Where's your sister?

00:37:33,649 --> 00:37:35,951
Inez?

00:37:44,092 --> 00:37:47,629
BOYD:
<i>I went outside looking</i>
<i>for Grace,</i>

00:37:47,696 --> 00:37:49,865
but she had the car,

00:37:49,931 --> 00:37:52,334
she wasn't home from work yet.

00:37:54,836 --> 00:37:56,772
<i>I was scared.</i>

00:37:56,838 --> 00:37:58,840
<i>I didn't know what to do.</i>

00:38:02,944 --> 00:38:05,714
CATHERINE:
<i>So you're telling me that</i>
<i>you had your little girl</i>

00:38:05,781 --> 00:38:09,484
<i>in your arms</i>
<i>with her heart still beating,</i>

00:38:09,551 --> 00:38:11,887
<i>and you took the bus</i>
<i>to the hospital?</i>

00:38:11,953 --> 00:38:14,623
BOYD:
<i>I thought if I let her go,</i>
<i>she would die.</i>

00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:17,426
But she died anyway.

00:38:53,495 --> 00:38:55,831
If it was just an accident,

00:38:55,897 --> 00:38:58,033
why didn't you just report it?

00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,869
(sighs)

00:39:00,936 --> 00:39:02,971
Look at who I am.

00:39:05,874 --> 00:39:08,810
If I reported her death,
who would have believed me, huh?

00:39:08,877 --> 00:39:10,479
At the very least,

00:39:10,545 --> 00:39:13,115
they would have taken
my children away from me,

00:39:13,181 --> 00:39:15,917
probably sent me back
to jail, too.

00:39:15,984 --> 00:39:18,086
What would the point
of that have been?

00:39:21,523 --> 00:39:24,693
She was dead, and...

00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,896
breaking up my family
and leaving my children

00:39:27,963 --> 00:39:29,831
without a daddy
wasn't gonna bring her back.

00:39:31,933 --> 00:39:34,269
So you ran?

00:39:36,338 --> 00:39:38,707
See how well that turned out.

00:39:42,878 --> 00:39:44,880
(sighs)

00:39:50,986 --> 00:39:52,954
Catherine?

00:39:53,021 --> 00:39:55,724
You should see this.

00:39:57,659 --> 00:40:00,062
(computer beeps)

00:40:00,128 --> 00:40:02,130
(beep)

00:40:05,901 --> 00:40:09,404
GRISSOM:
It seems they
loved her.

00:40:09,471 --> 00:40:11,606
I think it
makes it worse.

00:40:11,673 --> 00:40:13,241
(beep)

00:40:13,308 --> 00:40:15,344
(trilling and beep)

00:40:16,345 --> 00:40:18,413
(keys jingling)

00:40:28,056 --> 00:40:30,292
(glass bottles clinking)

00:40:33,428 --> 00:40:35,731
(quiet sigh)

00:40:35,797 --> 00:40:36,965
CATHERINE:
Oh.

00:40:39,201 --> 00:40:40,369
(sighs)

00:40:40,435 --> 00:40:41,770
What are you doing here?

00:40:41,837 --> 00:40:43,805
I was waiting for you.

00:40:43,872 --> 00:40:46,708
How did you get in here?

00:40:46,775 --> 00:40:48,443
Can't we talk about
something interesting?

00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:50,345
Me, for instance.

00:40:50,412 --> 00:40:52,147
I'm interesting.

00:40:52,214 --> 00:40:53,548
Yeah, let's do that.

00:40:53,615 --> 00:40:54,783
Let's talk about you.

00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:57,219
For starters, Nora left me.

00:40:57,285 --> 00:40:59,888
Actually, she threw my
stuff out in the street,

00:40:59,955 --> 00:41:02,424
got a restraining
order on me, notified

00:41:02,491 --> 00:41:04,493
the neighbors
and called my boss.

00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:06,895
"Hey, scumbag,
don't bother coming in.

00:41:06,962 --> 00:41:09,031
We'll mail you your last check."

00:41:09,097 --> 00:41:11,967
So, in one fell swoop,
as it were,

00:41:12,034 --> 00:41:14,102
I lost my girlfriend,
my livelihood

00:41:14,169 --> 00:41:16,838
and my place to live.

00:41:16,905 --> 00:41:20,108
I thought it was going to
be different this time.

00:41:21,143 --> 00:41:23,979
Frankly, I blame you.

00:41:24,046 --> 00:41:25,981
I didn't create
the circumstances

00:41:26,048 --> 00:41:27,749
of your life, Leo.

00:41:27,816 --> 00:41:29,584
You grind up the innocent
with the guilty.

00:41:29,651 --> 00:41:30,919
Just take it easy.

00:41:30,986 --> 00:41:32,587
I was just doing my job.

00:41:32,654 --> 00:41:34,690
I was just
doing my job?
Yeah, I was just

00:41:34,756 --> 00:41:36,591
doing my job.
I was just
doing my job.

00:41:36,658 --> 00:41:37,893
I was just
following orders.

00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,294
Blond Nazi bitch!

00:41:39,361 --> 00:41:41,997
You get in there

00:41:42,064 --> 00:41:44,633
with your big boots,
and you kick it all apart,

00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,768
and you don't care who you hurt,

00:41:46,835 --> 00:41:48,904
whose life you destroy
in the process.

00:41:48,971 --> 00:41:51,206
Calm down.
No.

00:41:51,273 --> 00:41:52,574
It's not fair!
Just calm down!

00:41:52,641 --> 00:41:54,409
Calm down...
Don't tell me
to calm down!

00:41:54,476 --> 00:41:56,411
Just stay back
and calm down.

00:41:56,478 --> 00:41:59,881
You're going
to shoot me?

00:41:59,948 --> 00:42:01,049
Would that help you to forget

00:42:01,116 --> 00:42:02,351
how completely
you screwed my life up?

00:42:02,417 --> 00:42:04,886
Would you sleep
better at night?

00:42:04,953 --> 00:42:07,289
Maybe I should just
save you the trouble

00:42:07,356 --> 00:42:09,157
and blow my own brains out, hmm?

00:42:09,224 --> 00:42:11,159
What do you think?

00:42:11,226 --> 00:42:13,729
I think you need
to talk to somebody.

00:42:13,795 --> 00:42:16,732
I am talking to somebody.

00:42:16,798 --> 00:42:18,900
I'm talking to you.

00:42:18,967 --> 00:42:21,937
So how about this?

00:42:22,004 --> 00:42:23,805
If I do decide to kill myself,

00:42:23,872 --> 00:42:25,907
I'm going to come over
to your house

00:42:25,974 --> 00:42:29,044
and blow my brains out
right on your front lawn,

00:42:29,111 --> 00:42:30,345
as a gift to you

00:42:30,412 --> 00:42:33,382
and everything
you stand for.

00:42:33,448 --> 00:42:36,218
How does that work for you?
