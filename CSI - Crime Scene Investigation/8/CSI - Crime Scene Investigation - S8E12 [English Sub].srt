00:00:03,083 --> 00:00:04,952
WOMAN:
<i>Nobody knew he was coming.</i>


00:00:05,018 --> 00:00:07,187
<i>Nobody knew his name.</i>


00:00:07,254 --> 00:00:10,691
<i>Well, if you'd stop talking</i>
<i>for a minute, you'd understand.</i>


00:00:10,757 --> 00:00:12,559
<i>The investigation's been</i>
<i>compromised.</i>


00:00:12,626 --> 00:00:14,861
<i>Lives are at risk.</i>


00:00:14,928 --> 00:00:18,198
<i>How many people</i>
<i>do the right thing anymore?</i>


00:00:18,265 --> 00:00:19,633
<i>Have a conscience?</i>


00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,803
<i>Don Cook didn't even know</i>
<i>what he saw.</i>


00:00:22,869 --> 00:00:25,005
<i>El Matocho doesn't kill</i>
<i>for the thrill</i>

00:00:25,072 --> 00:00:27,207
<i>or because he was abused</i>
<i>as a child.</i>

00:00:27,274 --> 00:00:30,544
<i>He kills because</i>
<i>it's his answer to everything.</i>

00:00:30,611 --> 00:00:31,878
<i>I had him eyewitnessed.</i>

00:00:31,945 --> 00:00:33,981
<i>It was enough</i>
<i>for an indictment.</i>

00:00:34,047 --> 00:00:35,682
<i>No indictment, no trial.</i>

00:00:35,749 --> 00:00:37,951
<i>He goes free</i>
<i>and La Tijera gets stronger.</i>

00:00:38,018 --> 00:00:41,688
<i>So don't patronize me by saying</i>
<i>this might be an accident.</i>

00:00:41,755 --> 00:00:44,458
<i>I don't care who's on call,</i>
<i>Conrad,</i>

00:00:44,524 --> 00:00:46,093
<i>or about your stupid protocol.</i>

00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:47,728
<i>I want Grissom.</i>

00:00:47,794 --> 00:00:51,164
1000 Chestnut
and 918...

00:00:51,231 --> 00:00:53,166
Maybe the reception sucks
out here.

00:00:53,233 --> 00:00:56,003
I said I want Grissom.

00:00:56,069 --> 00:00:58,905
Say I asked for him personally.

00:01:01,808 --> 00:01:03,977
I don't want anyone
touching anything.

00:01:04,044 --> 00:01:04,978
Thanks for all

00:01:05,045 --> 00:01:07,915
your help, guys.

00:01:07,981 --> 00:01:09,683
Case is reassigned to Grissom.

00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,518
He's home sick, Maddy.

00:01:11,585 --> 00:01:14,221
Yeah, I heard all about it
from Ecklie. Blah, blah, blah.

00:01:14,288 --> 00:01:16,723
The point that he and you
seem to be missing

00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:18,558
is that I have 18

00:01:18,625 --> 00:01:20,727
grand jurists sifting
through evidence,

00:01:20,794 --> 00:01:22,796
trying to help me indict one
of the deadliest gangs

00:01:22,863 --> 00:01:23,864
this city has ever...

00:01:23,931 --> 00:01:24,932
Who's in charge of the scene?!

00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,185
I am.

00:01:27,251 --> 00:01:29,954
For God's sake.

00:01:33,691 --> 00:01:35,326
Madeleine Klein, Deputy DA.

00:01:35,393 --> 00:01:38,729
Albert Robbins,
Clark County Coroner.

00:01:40,898 --> 00:01:43,534
BRASS:
Talk to me, David.

00:01:43,601 --> 00:01:45,670
Confirms it's Don Cook.

00:01:45,736 --> 00:01:47,538
This is on us.

00:01:47,605 --> 00:01:49,640
What do you got, Doc?

00:01:49,707 --> 00:01:52,109
Other than the obvious burns
over the better part

00:01:52,176 --> 00:01:55,346
of his body,
there's this.

00:01:55,413 --> 00:01:57,348
He was shot.

WILLOWS:
Let me run it down for you.


00:03:09,636 --> 00:03:11,505
Isolated stretch of Route 2,


00:03:11,571 --> 00:03:13,206
burned car on the shoulder,


00:03:13,273 --> 00:03:16,610
burned male victim
out of the car 20 feet away.


00:03:16,677 --> 00:03:19,079
Single gunshot wound
to the lower back.


00:03:19,146 --> 00:03:20,681
Passing motorist called it in.


00:03:20,747 --> 00:03:23,183
Fire department arrived
within 12 minutes.


00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,619
Fire burned so hot,
they had to use foam


00:03:25,686 --> 00:03:28,922
to put it out, which, of course,
is never good for us.


00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:30,390
Where is he?


00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,362
I've been waiting
over an hour for you.


00:03:35,429 --> 00:03:38,699
What, are you walking here?


00:03:38,765 --> 00:03:40,834
How many times have
I gotten out of bed


00:03:40,901 --> 00:03:43,270
in the middle of the
night for you, Gil?


00:03:43,337 --> 00:03:47,574
Yeah. Yeah, well, I'd like
to phone it in, too.


00:03:47,641 --> 00:03:49,309
I left an AA meeting
for this.


00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,912
Trumps walking pneumonia.


00:03:51,979 --> 00:03:54,481
Here you go,
Eyes-and-Ears.


00:03:54,548 --> 00:03:55,582
We'll keep in touch.


00:03:56,817 --> 00:04:00,520
So the Deputy DA got out of bed
for you?


00:04:00,587 --> 00:04:01,588
Whose bed?


00:04:01,655 --> 00:04:02,889
Talk to me about the road.


00:04:02,956 --> 00:04:04,057
All right.


00:04:04,124 --> 00:04:10,430
The debris path starts
approximately 100 yards


00:04:10,497 --> 00:04:12,933
from where the vehicle
came to rest.


00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,701
Show me what you see.


00:04:32,219 --> 00:04:34,087
What are you doing,
a catalog shoot?


00:04:34,154 --> 00:04:36,423
Where's your matching hat
with your pom-pom?


00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:39,159
Leave me alone.
I have a cold.


00:04:39,226 --> 00:04:41,862
So, based on the
debris pattern,


00:04:41,928 --> 00:04:44,831
the victim was driving the car
when the blaze started.


00:04:44,898 --> 00:04:47,167
Swerving all over
the road.


00:04:47,234 --> 00:04:49,336
Probably because he was on fire.


00:04:50,203 --> 00:04:52,639
(tires squealing)


00:04:56,476 --> 00:04:57,978
(crashing)


00:04:59,179 --> 00:05:01,748
What do you think?


00:05:01,815 --> 00:05:03,951
Sounds about right.


00:05:05,285 --> 00:05:06,787
(shutter clicks)


00:05:11,825 --> 00:05:13,961
(loud sneeze)


00:05:14,027 --> 00:05:15,128
Gesundheit.


00:05:15,195 --> 00:05:16,663
Thanks.


00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,498
Boy, I hope
<i>I'm</i> not getting sick.


00:05:18,565 --> 00:05:21,001
I'm not finding any pour
patterns on the exterior.


00:05:21,068 --> 00:05:23,170
The hood


00:05:23,236 --> 00:05:24,838
and the front quarter panels
are down to the primer


00:05:24,905 --> 00:05:26,640
and the front tires are
burnt down to the rim.


00:05:26,707 --> 00:05:29,910
Think the fire
probably started in
the engine compartment.


00:05:29,977 --> 00:05:30,944
New car engines


00:05:31,011 --> 00:05:33,280
don't catch fire,
not by accident.


00:05:33,347 --> 00:05:35,349
Now we'll have to get it back
to the lab for a closer look.


00:05:35,415 --> 00:05:38,952
And guys on fire don't stop
to close doors.


00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:41,221
No, no, I talked to the
battalion chief about that.


00:05:41,288 --> 00:05:43,156
He said the driver's
side was open


00:05:43,223 --> 00:05:44,458
when his boys showed up,


00:05:44,524 --> 00:05:47,127
and that the pressure from
the hose probably closed it.


00:05:47,194 --> 00:05:49,396
Probably?


00:05:49,463 --> 00:05:51,565
Hosers.


00:05:53,834 --> 00:05:55,002
Nick, come here.


00:06:01,008 --> 00:06:02,776
Clear that off, would you?


00:06:09,249 --> 00:06:12,719
"L-A-T." That's La Tijera's tag.


00:06:16,223 --> 00:06:18,358
Boy, you look like hell.


00:06:18,425 --> 00:06:20,560
I need sugar. You got a soda?


00:06:20,627 --> 00:06:22,896
Nice to see you, too, Maddy.


00:06:22,963 --> 00:06:25,499
Six months' worth
of investigation;


00:06:25,565 --> 00:06:27,601
two months working
with the grand jury;


00:06:27,668 --> 00:06:29,936
five low-level indictments
against the LATs.


00:06:30,003 --> 00:06:33,840
Why you? 'Cause you're the only
one who won't screw it up.


00:06:33,907 --> 00:06:36,043
My team won't
screw it up.


00:06:36,109 --> 00:06:37,444
Oh, right.


00:06:37,511 --> 00:06:39,646
Your team.


00:06:39,713 --> 00:06:43,250
Warrick Brown got mixed up
with a crooked judge.


00:06:43,317 --> 00:06:46,119
Sanders ran down a civilian
while on duty.


00:06:46,186 --> 00:06:49,723
Ms. Willows lied about
being at a crime scene,


00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:51,525
among other things.


00:06:51,591 --> 00:06:55,128
And who can forget Stokes,
your straight arrow?


00:06:55,195 --> 00:06:57,864
Suspected of killing
his hooker girlfriend.


00:06:57,931 --> 00:06:59,666
How does the song go?


00:06:59,733 --> 00:07:01,735
"You call me up,
I get 'em out of it"?


00:07:01,802 --> 00:07:04,171
If it weren't for me,
you'd have no team.


00:07:04,237 --> 00:07:05,305
Are you done?


00:07:05,372 --> 00:07:06,473
(soda can opens)


00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:10,143
Sorry. You have a...?


00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:18,418
This was recorded two weeks ago.


00:07:18,485 --> 00:07:20,954
This guy had no idea


00:07:21,021 --> 00:07:22,055
that what he saw


00:07:22,122 --> 00:07:23,657
was the key to bringing
down La Tijera


00:07:23,724 --> 00:07:24,825
and their leader
El Matocho.


00:07:27,561 --> 00:07:31,632
MAN:
Okay, I know this
is my third violation,


00:07:31,698 --> 00:07:33,033
but I was not speeding.


00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,869
I-I blew past that light because
I had a fight with my wife.


00:07:35,936 --> 00:07:40,240
BRASS:
Listen, you're not here
for a traffic violation, okay?


00:07:40,307 --> 00:07:43,043
Now, after you ran
the red light,


00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:44,578
the street camera
didn't pick you up


00:07:44,645 --> 00:07:46,113
at the next intersection.
Where'd you go?


00:07:46,179 --> 00:07:51,084
Okay, look, I, I cannot have
my license suspended.


00:07:51,151 --> 00:07:53,020
I have a vending machine
business.


00:07:53,086 --> 00:07:54,621
You're not here
for a traffic violation.


00:07:54,688 --> 00:07:56,089
Let's get that straight.


00:07:56,156 --> 00:07:57,958
Now, did you see anyone
in particular?


00:07:58,025 --> 00:07:59,393
You remember that night?


00:07:59,459 --> 00:08:02,362
Yeah, yeah, no. Um, yeah,
there was, there was a guy


00:08:02,429 --> 00:08:03,630
who walked past my car.


00:08:03,697 --> 00:08:05,032
Okay.


00:08:05,098 --> 00:08:07,734
I thought I was gonna get robbed
on top of everything else.


00:08:07,801 --> 00:08:10,103
Can you identify
him, hmm?

00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:11,571
Sure, yeah.

00:08:11,638 --> 00:08:13,640
He walked under a streetlight.
I saw him. I saw him real clear.

00:08:13,707 --> 00:08:15,108
He, um...

00:08:15,175 --> 00:08:20,847
He was Hispanic, uh, I don't
know, bald, scary-looking.

00:08:20,914 --> 00:08:24,251
"LAT" carved into the cheek
of the victim

00:08:24,318 --> 00:08:26,620
is the signature
of El Matocho,

00:08:26,687 --> 00:08:28,522
La Tijera's number one.

00:08:28,588 --> 00:08:31,291
He killed this guy--
Little Gordo,

00:08:31,358 --> 00:08:33,527
but he was a ghost;
no face, no name.

00:08:33,593 --> 00:08:38,632
<i>Until Don Cook ID'd</i>
<i>Emilio Alvarado</i>

00:08:38,699 --> 00:08:40,567
<i>coming out</i>
<i>of Little Gordo's house</i>

00:08:40,634 --> 00:08:42,269
<i>around the time of the murder.</i>

00:08:42,336 --> 00:08:43,804
Turns out Alvarado

00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,706
was caught up
in a gang sweep

00:08:45,772 --> 00:08:47,441
day after the murder.
Parole violation.

00:08:47,507 --> 00:08:48,542
He got 30 days.

00:08:48,608 --> 00:08:50,744
PD thought
he was just another lowlife.

00:08:50,811 --> 00:08:54,648
Due to be released in 52 hours.

00:08:54,715 --> 00:08:57,217
Can't indict Alvarado
with a dead witness.

00:08:57,284 --> 00:08:59,419
We need to prove conspiracy.

00:08:59,486 --> 00:09:02,990
You need to prove that Alvarado
ordered a hit on your witness.

00:09:03,056 --> 00:09:04,658
How long do you think
it'll take you

00:09:04,725 --> 00:09:07,361
to bone up on these
and put a suit on?

00:09:09,329 --> 00:09:10,764
Can I smoke in here?

00:09:10,831 --> 00:09:12,532
Uh, no.

00:09:12,599 --> 00:09:14,635
It's a... it's a
government building.

00:09:17,471 --> 00:09:20,440
I'm very sorry
for your loss.

00:09:20,507 --> 00:09:22,776
So when was the last time
you saw Don?

00:09:22,843 --> 00:09:25,412
Last night.

00:09:25,479 --> 00:09:30,050
We go to my folks' house
every Sunday.

00:09:30,117 --> 00:09:32,452
Mrs. Cook, did you know
that your husband was going

00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:34,187
to testify before a grand jury?

00:09:34,254 --> 00:09:36,123
We talked about it.

00:09:36,189 --> 00:09:38,558
I told him
I didn't want him to do it.

00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:44,798
But he found out about this
girl, what the gang did to her.

00:09:44,865 --> 00:09:48,035
Did he confide in anyone else?

00:09:48,101 --> 00:09:50,604
He said it was a secret.

00:09:50,671 --> 00:09:52,906
Did you tell anyone?

00:09:52,973 --> 00:09:54,107
No.

00:09:54,174 --> 00:09:56,410
Well... sort of.

00:09:56,476 --> 00:09:59,613
I told my mom and dad
and my best friend Jenny.

00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,549
She's my hairdresser.
I tell her everything.

00:10:02,616 --> 00:10:05,786
I'm gonna need
their phone numbers.

00:10:05,852 --> 00:10:08,322
Did I do something wrong?

00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:12,592
(camera shutter clicking)

00:10:15,462 --> 00:10:17,397
Oh, hey, Dave,

00:10:17,464 --> 00:10:20,334
nice haircut.
What gives?

00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,437
Oh, Mrs. Phillips.
An extreme makeover.

00:10:23,503 --> 00:10:27,774
Mm. Oh, make sure you get
those photos to Grissom.

00:10:27,841 --> 00:10:28,842
I'm all over it.

00:10:28,909 --> 00:10:30,444
Sign of a good marriage.

00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,179
Wife still wants to change him.

00:10:32,245 --> 00:10:37,751
So your vic's burns are
concentrated on the face, hands,

00:10:37,818 --> 00:10:39,686
knees and feet.

00:10:39,753 --> 00:10:41,822
It's consistent
with an engine fire.

00:10:41,888 --> 00:10:45,826
(man screams)

00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,331
Jacketed hollowpoint.

00:10:51,398 --> 00:10:53,800
One cannelure.
Looks like a .38.

00:10:53,867 --> 00:10:54,801
Yeah.

00:10:54,868 --> 00:10:56,870
Entered through
the right renal artery.

00:10:56,937 --> 00:10:58,005
That's COD.

00:10:59,272 --> 00:11:01,274

00:11:03,944 --> 00:11:05,946

00:11:10,951 --> 00:11:13,553
Wow. I bet it
reeks in here.

00:11:14,588 --> 00:11:16,390
I wouldn't know.

00:11:16,456 --> 00:11:17,791
Thank God for stuffy noses.

00:11:17,858 --> 00:11:19,059
Yeah.

00:11:19,126 --> 00:11:20,494
DA Klein asked Grissom,

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,297
who asked Catherine,
who told me to tell you that

00:11:23,363 --> 00:11:26,566
we need to figure out
if the victim was shot

00:11:26,633 --> 00:11:29,836
before he got in the car,
while he was in the car

00:11:29,903 --> 00:11:31,705
or after he got out.

00:11:31,772 --> 00:11:35,175
Okay, uh, there was
no blood trail at the scene.

00:11:35,242 --> 00:11:36,910
Fire pretty much
took care of that.

00:11:36,977 --> 00:11:38,979
And I doubt you're gonna find
any trace of blood

00:11:39,046 --> 00:11:40,681
in that burnt-up driver seat.

00:11:40,747 --> 00:11:42,749
Wow, I've got to give her
more than that.

00:11:42,816 --> 00:11:43,917
Be my guest.

00:11:43,984 --> 00:11:45,085
(coughs)

00:11:45,152 --> 00:11:47,154
(sneezes)

00:12:05,739 --> 00:12:08,175
Skin on a seat belt buckle.

00:12:08,241 --> 00:12:10,277
You know,

00:12:10,344 --> 00:12:11,979
if I got shot
and I'm trying to get away,

00:12:12,045 --> 00:12:14,281
I'm not gonna take the time
to put my seat belt on.

00:12:14,348 --> 00:12:17,117
Eliminates the first scenario.

00:12:17,184 --> 00:12:19,720
So either the shooter
kidnaps him and shot him

00:12:19,786 --> 00:12:21,221
while he was driving...
I don't know.

00:12:21,288 --> 00:12:22,856
Greg, I think
we would have found evidence

00:12:22,923 --> 00:12:24,024
of somebody else
inside the vehicle.

00:12:24,091 --> 00:12:27,427
Which leaves us
with the last scenario.

00:12:29,029 --> 00:12:30,497
(gunshot)

00:12:31,865 --> 00:12:34,267
I think I just found my reason
for getting out of bed

00:12:34,334 --> 00:12:36,637
this morning.

00:12:39,773 --> 00:12:41,308
Check it out.

00:12:43,477 --> 00:12:45,612
The same guy that
tampered with the car

00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:47,648
could have followed.

00:12:47,714 --> 00:12:49,916
Made sure the job was done.

00:12:49,983 --> 00:12:52,319
Who killed him?
Do you have evidence
that the witness

00:12:52,386 --> 00:12:53,420
was murdered?
How did they kill him?

00:12:53,487 --> 00:12:54,655
One at a time, Miss Leahy.

00:12:54,721 --> 00:12:56,390
Do you know who killed him?

00:12:56,456 --> 00:12:57,991
We don't know yet.

00:12:58,058 --> 00:13:00,327
Our investigation
is still ongoing.

00:13:01,595 --> 00:13:03,330
What was the guy gonna tell us?

00:13:03,397 --> 00:13:06,133
Until Dr. Grissom can
corroborate Mr. Cook's

00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:07,668
testimony,
I can't tell you

00:13:07,734 --> 00:13:09,536
the content.
Mr. O'Shea.

00:13:09,603 --> 00:13:11,805
We've been locked up in here
ten hours a day,

00:13:11,872 --> 00:13:13,774
two months,
all cloak-and-dagger.

00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,109
La Tijera doesn't know
we're investigating them,

00:13:16,176 --> 00:13:19,079
so they couldn't know
about the witness.

00:13:19,146 --> 00:13:22,215
Well, we found their signature
at the crime scene.

00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:26,820
So it's possible
they do know.

00:13:26,887 --> 00:13:28,655
If they got to this witness,
could they get to us?

00:13:28,722 --> 00:13:30,324
I have a family.

00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,692
So do I.

00:13:31,758 --> 00:13:34,194
I want to know how the gang
found out about Don Cook.

00:13:34,261 --> 00:13:35,629
O'SHEA:
Me, too.

00:13:35,696 --> 00:13:37,698
Or else I want
off this jury.

00:13:43,637 --> 00:13:46,873
Hey, I, uh, brought
some more files on the case.

00:13:49,743 --> 00:13:51,578
Got any coffee?

00:13:52,612 --> 00:13:54,114
I got lots of tea.

00:13:54,181 --> 00:13:55,349
Good.

00:13:57,818 --> 00:14:00,153
You know, when we first
asked Cook to testify

00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,522
he said no,
and, uh, but...

00:14:02,589 --> 00:14:04,591
you know, I couldn't let it go.

00:14:06,259 --> 00:14:08,095
So I called him up
about a week later

00:14:08,161 --> 00:14:10,931
and, uh, took him to lunch
and I showed him a picture

00:14:10,998 --> 00:14:14,601
of, uh... of a girl
that they had killed, you know.

00:14:14,668 --> 00:14:18,138
She was 16, innocent, beautiful.

00:14:18,205 --> 00:14:21,608
She was raped, shot,

00:14:21,675 --> 00:14:24,211
and urinated on.

00:14:24,277 --> 00:14:26,647
And when that
didn't kill her,

00:14:26,713 --> 00:14:29,182
they slit her throat.

00:14:29,249 --> 00:14:31,451
So I had him on the hook.

00:14:32,853 --> 00:14:36,223
When I told him that,
uh, you know, if he testified,

00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:39,626
I'd protect him and his family
if the case ever came to trial.

00:14:41,795 --> 00:14:44,064
On Friday, he called Maddy,

00:14:44,131 --> 00:14:46,800
said he changed his mind,
he'd testify.

00:14:50,971 --> 00:14:53,473
And on Sunday...

00:14:56,143 --> 00:14:57,811
he was dead.

00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:04,418
I couldn't protect him.

00:15:08,422 --> 00:15:10,424

00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:42,727
GRISSOM:
You feeling okay?

00:21:42,794 --> 00:21:46,497
Yeah. My ears are
still ringing, though.

00:21:46,564 --> 00:21:48,132
This place reeks
of sulfur.

00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,335
(camera shutter clicks)

00:21:50,401 --> 00:21:54,238
I found about
ten of these butane cans so far.

00:21:54,305 --> 00:21:56,841
Any evidence that's here
is gone.

00:21:56,908 --> 00:21:58,876
(camera shutter clicking)

00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:00,912
Yeah, well,
there's burn patterns

00:22:00,979 --> 00:22:02,914
all over these walls.

00:22:02,981 --> 00:22:05,817
They must have splashed butane
all over everything.

00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:11,489
And butane dissipates quick.

00:22:11,556 --> 00:22:13,491
The other guy was probably
watching us the whole time.

00:22:20,565 --> 00:22:22,834
There's nails
all over the place.

00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:26,170
Grissom, I think I found
the point of origin.

00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:32,644
(camera shutter clicking)

00:22:34,512 --> 00:22:36,447
Green plastic.

00:22:36,514 --> 00:22:38,816
Sugar, butane,
and nails.

00:22:38,883 --> 00:22:40,184
Add some

00:22:40,251 --> 00:22:41,519
egg whites in a soda bottle.

00:22:41,586 --> 00:22:43,187
You got a MacGyver bomb.

00:22:43,254 --> 00:22:44,656
Crude, but it works.

00:22:44,722 --> 00:22:48,793
I think they were looking to do
more than just destroy evidence.

00:22:49,792 --> 00:22:51,727
You running for
warrants, Mitch?

00:22:51,794 --> 00:22:52,895
Yeah.

00:22:52,962 --> 00:22:54,964
Impound their cars.
You got it.

00:23:16,819 --> 00:23:18,821
Mitch, I want to see
this guy's hands.

00:23:21,824 --> 00:23:23,759
You ain't a cop, fool.

00:23:23,826 --> 00:23:25,458
He's bigger than a cop.
Show him your hands, princess.

00:23:25,525 --> 00:23:26,626
They're clean.

00:23:26,692 --> 00:23:28,094
Want to lick 'em
and find out?

00:23:28,161 --> 00:23:30,129
You think
this is a game?

00:23:30,196 --> 00:23:31,164
Huh?

00:23:32,365 --> 00:23:34,834
This one's clean.

00:23:34,901 --> 00:23:36,102
What about this one?

00:23:36,169 --> 00:23:38,471
Clean.

00:23:38,538 --> 00:23:40,640
Turn his pockets.

00:23:46,412 --> 00:23:49,348
Sugar.

00:23:49,415 --> 00:23:50,616
What's this?

00:23:50,683 --> 00:23:52,318
You been baking cookies?

00:23:52,385 --> 00:23:55,822
BRASS:
So, who gave you the order
to torch that apartment?

00:23:55,888 --> 00:23:58,057
I don't know what
you're talkin' about.

00:23:58,124 --> 00:24:00,092
And why that
apartment?

00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,261
Who do you know lives there?

00:24:02,328 --> 00:24:04,263
Nobody.

00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:06,265
I got a mental illness.

00:24:06,332 --> 00:24:07,600
I'm a firebug.

00:24:07,667 --> 00:24:08,668
I'm <i>loco.</i>

00:24:08,734 --> 00:24:11,003
You're <i>loco?</i>
Who knows?

00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:14,173
Maybe I'll set the lawyer
lady's house on fire.

00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,709
Hey, little man
with the big mouth.

00:24:16,776 --> 00:24:18,511
It doesn't matter
what you say,

00:24:18,578 --> 00:24:20,012
'cause all your boys
are going to hear

00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:21,080
is that you rolled on Alvarado.

00:24:23,616 --> 00:24:25,618
Just bought yourself
another ten years.

00:24:25,685 --> 00:24:27,420
I'm going to hand-pick
your cell mate.

00:24:28,688 --> 00:24:30,623
Well, that didn't help.

00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:33,626
That kid wouldn't roll
if I gave him a night
with Jessica Alba.

00:24:33,693 --> 00:24:35,995
You're pretty good
at making enemies, Maddy.

00:24:36,062 --> 00:24:38,865
That's why I'm unlisted,
divorced and carry a gun.

00:24:38,931 --> 00:24:41,300
Did you take Cook back
to Little Gordo's house?

00:24:41,367 --> 00:24:43,369
You know, maybe
to verify his story?

00:24:43,436 --> 00:24:45,471
Yeah, I always take
my secret witnesses

00:24:45,538 --> 00:24:46,906
on a bus tour
of the "hood."

00:24:46,973 --> 00:24:49,075
You know, when Don Cook
first refused to testify

00:24:49,141 --> 00:24:51,143
that he saw Alvarado come
out of Little Gordo's house,

00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:52,178
you know what I did?

00:24:52,245 --> 00:24:53,679
I took him to an
out-of-town diner

00:24:53,746 --> 00:24:54,881
and bought him
a cup of coffee.

00:24:54,947 --> 00:24:57,216
What'd you do?

00:24:57,283 --> 00:25:00,019
I went to Little Gordo's.

00:25:02,722 --> 00:25:05,057
Damn it.

00:25:05,124 --> 00:25:07,059
Good job, Maddy.

00:25:07,126 --> 00:25:09,128
They saw me.

00:25:10,429 --> 00:25:13,366
I can't even blame it
on the booze.

00:25:13,432 --> 00:25:15,868
All they had to do was trail me
back to the courthouse

00:25:15,935 --> 00:25:17,703
and watch me go
into the security entrance

00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:19,038
with 18 escorted jurors.

00:25:19,105 --> 00:25:20,373
That's how they knew grand jury.

00:25:20,439 --> 00:25:21,607
Damn it!

00:25:21,674 --> 00:25:23,676
(sighs)

00:25:27,847 --> 00:25:29,582
This is where you're
supposed to say,

00:25:29,649 --> 00:25:31,350
"It's okay. It could
happen to anyone.

00:25:31,417 --> 00:25:35,254
It's not your fault
Don Cook is dead."

00:25:35,321 --> 00:25:37,323
Like hell it isn't.

00:25:40,526 --> 00:25:42,461
(coughing)

00:25:42,528 --> 00:25:44,463
Hey, Nick!

00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:46,465
You've got an artful tagger.

00:25:46,532 --> 00:25:48,467
What?

00:25:48,534 --> 00:25:50,136
Don Cook's car bumper.

00:25:50,203 --> 00:25:52,271
Gangbanger blended his green
with another color.

00:25:52,338 --> 00:25:54,273
Not visible to
the human eye.

00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,608
Of course,
I caught it.

00:25:55,675 --> 00:25:57,276
You mean
the GCMS caught it?

00:25:57,343 --> 00:25:59,278
Well, if that's a hair
you want to split.

00:25:59,345 --> 00:26:02,081
Suspect used green paint
with a hint of cerulean blue.

00:26:02,148 --> 00:26:03,416
Probably for impact.

00:26:03,483 --> 00:26:06,152
(coughs)

00:26:06,219 --> 00:26:07,720
(clearing throat)

00:26:07,787 --> 00:26:09,789
You know, in China
people wear masks
when they're sick.

00:26:09,856 --> 00:26:12,124
It's considered impolite
to infect your coworkers.

00:26:12,191 --> 00:26:14,393
Maybe you should go
work in China.

00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:17,029
Maybe you should wear a mask.

00:26:19,065 --> 00:26:21,834
Now, this is everything
Alvarado had

00:26:21,901 --> 00:26:24,837
and was wearing
when they arrested him?

00:26:24,904 --> 00:26:26,906
Thank you.

00:26:51,731 --> 00:26:54,167
GUARD:
He's been in isolation
for two weeks.

00:26:54,233 --> 00:26:56,502
I could tell you everything
he's got in his cell.

00:26:56,569 --> 00:26:58,171
They assigned
me special.

00:26:58,237 --> 00:27:00,173
Does he get
any yard time?
Nope.

00:27:00,239 --> 00:27:01,841
I take him
for hall walks.

00:27:01,908 --> 00:27:04,243
Not allowed any contact
with anybody but me.

00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:05,912
Why do you need to see him?

00:27:05,978 --> 00:27:07,580
Just want to rattle
his cage a bit.

00:27:07,647 --> 00:27:09,649
That cool
with you?
Good luck.

00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:12,585
Hey, Alvarado,

00:27:12,652 --> 00:27:13,686
get up.

00:27:13,753 --> 00:27:14,854
Cell check.

00:27:33,206 --> 00:27:35,208
(camera shutter clicking)

00:27:58,231 --> 00:28:02,168
So, you always clean your boots
with bleach, El Matocho?

00:28:02,235 --> 00:28:04,303
(laughs)

00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:06,472
Something funny?

00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:09,008
<i>Matocho.</i>

00:28:09,075 --> 00:28:11,677
Nonsense word.

00:28:11,744 --> 00:28:14,013
You know where
this name comes from?

00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,182
There's a legend
in Central America.

00:28:16,249 --> 00:28:19,185
This man,
he woke up in a bad mood.

00:28:19,252 --> 00:28:22,221
Killed eight members
of his family with a machete

00:28:22,288 --> 00:28:25,458
and then went and had breakfast.

00:28:27,894 --> 00:28:29,495
<i>Matar.</i>

00:28:29,562 --> 00:28:31,497
To kill.

00:28:31,564 --> 00:28:33,566
<i>Ocho.</i> Eight.

00:28:35,601 --> 00:28:38,237
"To kill eight."

00:28:38,304 --> 00:28:41,240
<i>El Matocho.</i>

00:28:41,307 --> 00:28:43,776
(laughs)

00:28:43,843 --> 00:28:45,778
(chuckles)

00:28:45,845 --> 00:28:47,780
That's great.

00:28:47,847 --> 00:28:50,249
The way I see it, you're going
to have lots of time

00:28:50,316 --> 00:28:51,984
to tell all kinds
of great stories.

00:28:53,019 --> 00:28:54,954
Tick-tock.

00:28:55,021 --> 00:28:56,989
Tick-tock. Tick-tock.

00:28:57,056 --> 00:28:58,891
Tick-tock.

00:29:00,693 --> 00:29:03,563
SANDERS:
<i>Alvarado is a suspect</i>
<i>in three cases.</i>

00:29:03,629 --> 00:29:05,431
First, he allegedly
kills

00:29:05,498 --> 00:29:06,966
Little Gordo.
Then,

00:29:07,033 --> 00:29:09,802
the only witness who could
identify him is killed.

00:29:09,869 --> 00:29:12,205
And last, but certainly
not least,

00:29:12,271 --> 00:29:14,073
he allegedly
orders Raphael Gomez

00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:16,075
to blow up
his apartment.
La Tijera

00:29:16,142 --> 00:29:18,110
is responsible
for all three crimes.

00:29:18,177 --> 00:29:20,279
Tags at both scenes,

00:29:20,346 --> 00:29:22,715
and Gomez is an admitted
member of the gang.

00:29:22,782 --> 00:29:24,851
According to Hodges,

00:29:24,917 --> 00:29:26,886
the tagger didn't
use spray paint.

00:29:26,953 --> 00:29:29,121
He used an oil-based
specialty paint.

00:29:29,188 --> 00:29:31,123
Well, that doesn't
make any sense.

00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:33,192
You got photos?

00:29:35,528 --> 00:29:37,763
(coughing)

00:29:42,235 --> 00:29:43,636
Here you go.

00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:56,949
This "L" looks
like it was stenciled.

00:29:59,185 --> 00:30:00,353
Then, it looks
like the tagger

00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:01,921
painted over it
a second time,

00:30:01,988 --> 00:30:03,322
to make it look freehand.

00:30:03,389 --> 00:30:04,390
What?

00:30:06,859 --> 00:30:09,495
Yeah, those, uh...

00:30:09,562 --> 00:30:11,764
those do look
like brush strokes.

00:30:11,831 --> 00:30:13,666
Well, gangs don't
use paintbrushes.

00:30:13,733 --> 00:30:16,769
I assumed the tags
were authentic.

00:30:16,836 --> 00:30:19,605
We've been moving in
the wrong direction.

00:30:19,672 --> 00:30:21,607
Cody, come on out here.

00:30:21,674 --> 00:30:23,943
So, you think this gang
messed with Don's car

00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:25,611
while we were
having dinner?

00:30:25,678 --> 00:30:27,613
That's what we're
here to find out.

00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,282
Cody, Mr. Brass wants
to talk to you.

00:30:29,348 --> 00:30:31,117
Hi, Cody.

00:30:31,184 --> 00:30:33,286
Where was your son-in-law's
car parked that night?

00:30:33,352 --> 00:30:35,021
Right over there.

00:30:40,893 --> 00:30:42,695
Those are nice.
Did you make those?

00:30:42,762 --> 00:30:45,398
Yeah, a hobby of mine
after I lost my job.

00:30:45,464 --> 00:30:46,566
Forced retirement.

00:30:46,632 --> 00:30:48,167
You know
how it goes.
Mmm.

00:30:48,234 --> 00:30:50,169
Want to buy one?
(chuckles)

00:30:50,236 --> 00:30:53,206
You keep the garage door closed
when you're not working?

00:30:53,272 --> 00:30:55,908
Well, it's not like
we have any neighbors.

00:30:56,876 --> 00:31:00,246
Anything ever gone missing?

00:31:00,313 --> 00:31:04,083
Sure, Cody's taking stuff
all the time.

00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:07,086
She'd rather spend
her money on clothes.

00:31:07,153 --> 00:31:09,422
Kids.

00:31:09,489 --> 00:31:11,424
Mind if I take this crate?

00:31:11,491 --> 00:31:13,893
What for?

00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,962
Fingerprints.

00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:18,998
Well, you're going
to find mine all over.

00:31:19,065 --> 00:31:20,666
That's why I'm going
to get yours, too, sir.

00:31:20,733 --> 00:31:22,335
So I can exclude you.

00:31:22,401 --> 00:31:23,436
Follow me.

00:31:23,503 --> 00:31:24,670
BRASS:
So, let me get this
straight.

00:31:24,737 --> 00:31:26,038
You come to your parents'
house for dinner

00:31:26,105 --> 00:31:27,373
and Don's the only
one that leaves.

00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,108
I already told you
why I wasn't in that car.

00:31:29,175 --> 00:31:31,444
My husband and I
were arguing.

00:31:31,511 --> 00:31:32,912
He was yelling at me.

00:31:32,979 --> 00:31:35,181
Okay, I'm having a hard time
keeping it straight.

00:31:35,248 --> 00:31:37,183
You do like my dress?
You don't like my dress?

00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:39,051
Can we please just not talk
about this now?

00:31:39,118 --> 00:31:40,286
When should we talk
about it?

00:31:40,353 --> 00:31:41,554
Cody, get
in the car.

00:31:41,621 --> 00:31:43,422
No, I'm not going
to get in the car.

00:31:43,489 --> 00:31:47,026
Listen. I loved the dress till
I found out it cost 300 bucks.

00:31:47,093 --> 00:31:48,694
You have a closet full
of dresses...

00:31:48,761 --> 00:31:50,263
Get in the car.

00:31:50,329 --> 00:31:52,265
No. Not until you apologize.

00:31:52,331 --> 00:31:53,599
Apologize to my parents!

00:31:53,666 --> 00:31:54,867
I'm not apologizing.

00:31:54,934 --> 00:31:57,870
CODY:
<i>I told him not to call me</i>
<i>until the court thing was over.</i>

00:31:57,937 --> 00:31:59,238
<i>I needed to cool off.</i>

00:31:59,305 --> 00:32:00,706
My dad says I was lucky.

00:32:00,773 --> 00:32:01,908
Ma'am,

00:32:01,974 --> 00:32:04,944
I'm going to need to get
your fingerprints, too.

00:32:05,011 --> 00:32:07,947
I don't like
where this is going.

00:32:08,014 --> 00:32:10,249
It's going downtown.

00:32:35,174 --> 00:32:36,943
So you killed him.

00:32:37,009 --> 00:32:38,945
And made it look
like a gang did it.

00:32:39,011 --> 00:32:41,914
And then you could buy all
the expensive dresses you want.

00:32:41,981 --> 00:32:43,416
I loved my husband.

00:32:43,483 --> 00:32:45,151
I didn't kill him, okay?

00:32:45,218 --> 00:32:46,652
You don't know me.

00:32:46,719 --> 00:32:48,221
You don't know my life.

00:33:08,574 --> 00:33:11,878
STOKES:
I found your fingerprints
on a stencil.

00:33:11,944 --> 00:33:16,349
It was the one
with green paint all over it.

00:33:16,415 --> 00:33:18,184
And the paint from one
of your paintbrushes

00:33:18,251 --> 00:33:22,021
is a match to the car.

00:33:24,957 --> 00:33:26,592
Your daughter said
you disappeared

00:33:26,659 --> 00:33:29,362
into the garage
right after dinner.

00:33:29,428 --> 00:33:31,664
That's when you stuck the rag
in the engine

00:33:31,731 --> 00:33:34,167
between the catalytic converter
and the heat shield.

00:33:38,638 --> 00:33:41,707
I think we all know
what that did. Hmm?

00:33:43,476 --> 00:33:46,612
Hey, you don't want to say
anything, fine.

00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:48,347
Write him up.

00:33:48,414 --> 00:33:51,384
Process him.

00:33:53,986 --> 00:33:56,122
STOKES:
You think the daughter
had anything to do with it?

00:33:56,189 --> 00:33:58,591
No.
CODY:
How could you?!

00:33:58,658 --> 00:33:59,926
Cook was her
meal ticket.

00:33:59,992 --> 00:34:01,093
You son of a bitch!

00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,095
You were gonna kill
your own daughter?!

00:34:03,162 --> 00:34:05,198
Over money so you
could get our business?!

00:34:05,264 --> 00:34:06,933
O'MALLEY:
I would never let you
get in that car!

00:34:06,999 --> 00:34:10,002
Well, you didn't try to stop me!
You just stood there!

00:34:10,069 --> 00:34:11,971
How many Sundays did you come
over and bitch to your mother

00:34:12,038 --> 00:34:14,273
about that selfish,
ungrateful bastard?!

00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:16,843
Don wanted to give you
the money; I said no!

00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:20,213
And all those nights Mom
and I stayed up talking--
it was about you!

00:34:20,279 --> 00:34:22,582
You owed me!
I hate you!

00:34:22,648 --> 00:34:25,485
I did you a favor!

00:34:27,487 --> 00:34:29,722
(knocking)

00:34:31,491 --> 00:34:32,825
Never thought
I'd be disappointed

00:34:32,892 --> 00:34:35,228
that we solved a case.

00:34:35,294 --> 00:34:38,097
Hmm.

00:34:38,164 --> 00:34:40,766
Court personnel files?

00:34:40,833 --> 00:34:43,903
Reading upside down is a talent.

00:34:43,970 --> 00:34:46,138
What are you looking for?

00:34:46,205 --> 00:34:47,473
The leak.

00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,942
90 minutes
after the warrant was issued,

00:34:50,009 --> 00:34:51,944
Alvarado's apartment went up.

00:34:52,011 --> 00:34:54,113
So you're looking at the judge,
his staff,

00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:56,816
the clerk that issued
the warrant,

00:34:56,883 --> 00:34:58,618
court reporter,
any cops who knew...

00:34:58,684 --> 00:35:02,488
Yeah, but according to this,
everybody cleared.

00:35:03,823 --> 00:35:06,959
The only ones left
are the grand jurors...

00:35:07,026 --> 00:35:09,428
and Maddy Klein.

00:35:14,333 --> 00:35:15,735
Thanks for coming in, Arch.
I appreciate it.

00:35:15,801 --> 00:35:17,770
All right. No worries.
Wasn't sleeping anyway.

00:35:17,837 --> 00:35:20,173
Big surf movie marathon
on cable right now.

00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:22,041
Ah.
Yeah, <i>Big Wednesday,</i>

00:35:22,108 --> 00:35:23,843
<i>Endless Summer,</i>
<i>Local Boys.</i>

00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:25,311
Dude.
Yeah.

00:35:25,378 --> 00:35:27,947
So we need to review
some phone records, and fast.

00:35:28,014 --> 00:35:30,950
Okay. It's going to be tough
to go fast with that many names.

00:35:31,017 --> 00:35:32,585
Oh, no.
I can narrow it down.

00:35:32,652 --> 00:35:34,587
It's a 90-minute window,
yesterday,

00:35:34,654 --> 00:35:36,522
at 12:00 noon to 1:30.

00:35:36,589 --> 00:35:38,858
Just cell phone calls.
Okay.

00:35:40,226 --> 00:35:42,094
Give me a name and a number.

00:35:42,161 --> 00:35:45,464
Timothy O'Shea. 702...

00:35:49,735 --> 00:35:51,370
He called two numbers.

00:35:51,437 --> 00:35:53,172
Do a reverse lookup.

00:35:53,239 --> 00:35:57,276
Looks like he called his wife
and his home line.

00:35:57,343 --> 00:35:58,744
Next.

00:35:58,811 --> 00:35:59,846
Cole Zampas...

00:35:59,912 --> 00:36:01,914
702-555-014...

00:36:01,981 --> 00:36:03,282
Jessica Varge...

00:36:03,349 --> 00:36:06,486
Darby Vance,
555-013...

00:36:06,552 --> 00:36:09,021
Marie Leahy.

00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:11,157
Okay.

00:36:14,427 --> 00:36:16,863
Huh. No user information.

00:36:16,929 --> 00:36:18,731
It usually means
disposable cell phone.

00:36:18,798 --> 00:36:20,399
Has she called
the number before,

00:36:20,466 --> 00:36:21,901
within the last two weeks?

00:36:21,968 --> 00:36:25,438
Monday through Friday,
both weeks,

00:36:25,505 --> 00:36:28,074
she called a different
disposable cell phone.

00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,842
That's weird.

00:36:29,909 --> 00:36:31,210
Okay. Try the text messages.

00:36:31,277 --> 00:36:32,478
Yeah.

00:36:34,714 --> 00:36:37,917
(computer beeping)

00:36:37,984 --> 00:36:39,752
See the pattern?

00:36:39,819 --> 00:36:41,708
Every night
around 11:00 p.m.,

00:36:41,775 --> 00:36:43,277
someone texts her a number,

00:36:43,343 --> 00:36:47,080
which she then calls
the next day.

00:36:47,147 --> 00:36:49,683
GRISSOM:
How did they contact you,
Miss Leahy?

00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:53,654
Uh... a few weeks ago,
at a gas station near my house,

00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,422
this, uh...

00:36:55,489 --> 00:36:58,358
this woman comes up to me
and, uh...

00:36:58,425 --> 00:37:02,129
she knows everything
about Peter.

00:37:02,196 --> 00:37:05,999
That's my little brother
in Chicago.

00:37:06,066 --> 00:37:08,368
He's only 19.

00:37:08,435 --> 00:37:11,038
Got ten years
for something he didn't do.

00:37:11,104 --> 00:37:13,807
And she said they'd get him out.

00:37:13,874 --> 00:37:16,076
And they did.

00:37:17,911 --> 00:37:21,381
Guy just confessed
and my brother's set to go free.

00:37:25,385 --> 00:37:29,623
Did that witness die
because of me?

00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:34,061
Can you give us a description
of the woman?

00:37:35,162 --> 00:37:38,198
She was white,

00:37:38,265 --> 00:37:42,302
uh, short brown hair...

00:37:45,439 --> 00:37:47,608
I'm sorry.

00:37:47,674 --> 00:37:50,144
I only seen her once.

00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,916
BROWN:
Alvarado gets out
in the morning.

00:37:55,983 --> 00:37:58,118
It is the morning.

00:37:58,185 --> 00:37:59,820
Exactly.
(slams table)

00:37:59,887 --> 00:38:01,588
(sighs)

00:38:01,655 --> 00:38:03,690
You know, none of these
people make a move

00:38:03,757 --> 00:38:05,459
without a direct order 
from Alvarado,

00:38:05,526 --> 00:38:08,061
especially not torching
his own place.

00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:09,496
What are you saying?

00:38:09,563 --> 00:38:10,664
Well, think about it.

00:38:10,731 --> 00:38:12,566
When Marie leaked
the warrant information,

00:38:12,633 --> 00:38:14,835
it had to have gone in and out
through him somehow.

00:38:14,902 --> 00:38:16,270
He's the boss.

00:38:16,336 --> 00:38:18,806
I don't see how; the guy's
in complete isolation.

00:38:18,872 --> 00:38:21,942
They even assigned him
a special hand-picked guard.

00:38:22,009 --> 00:38:23,477
Look.

00:38:23,544 --> 00:38:25,946
There's no privileges
in isolation.

00:38:26,013 --> 00:38:28,582
Things still move
in and out of his cell:

00:38:28,649 --> 00:38:30,317
laundry, food.

00:38:30,384 --> 00:38:32,953
The only thing I saw
from the outside was a book.

00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,688
They say he's a big reader.

00:38:34,755 --> 00:38:38,392
But I looked it over;
there's nothing.

00:38:38,458 --> 00:38:40,794
What about all the other books
he's been reading?

00:38:43,197 --> 00:38:45,132
How does Alvarado
get his books?

00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:47,534
It's like a regular library.

00:38:47,601 --> 00:38:50,404
When a book's checked out,
a trustee writes down

00:38:50,471 --> 00:38:53,574
the inmate's name,
booking number and date.

00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:56,543
Gets checked back in
the same way.

00:38:56,610 --> 00:39:00,214
I need to see every book
that Alvarado checked out.

00:39:03,016 --> 00:39:07,888
GUARD:
<i>What Is the What?</i>
<i>The Infinite Plan,</i>

00:39:07,955 --> 00:39:09,623
and <i>Herzog.</i>

00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:11,859
Oh... and <i>The Inferno.</i>

00:39:11,925 --> 00:39:13,961
Alphabetical by author?

00:39:14,027 --> 00:39:15,629
Mm-hmm.

00:39:21,034 --> 00:39:23,604
David Eggers.

00:39:33,747 --> 00:39:37,251
There's pages missing.

00:39:39,753 --> 00:39:43,223
Allende.

00:39:52,299 --> 00:39:54,635
How many books has he read
in the last 48 hours?

00:39:54,701 --> 00:39:56,570
Two.

00:39:58,472 --> 00:40:00,874
He said he didn't like this one;

00:40:00,941 --> 00:40:03,610
returned it
yesterday afternoon.

00:40:10,951 --> 00:40:14,121
Where's <i>The Inferno?</i>

00:40:14,188 --> 00:40:16,690
(metallic clanking)

00:40:20,294 --> 00:40:22,963
GUARD:
Hold up a minute.

00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:24,798
GUARD 2:
Orders to process him out.

00:40:24,865 --> 00:40:26,233
Just hold him.

00:40:38,045 --> 00:40:41,148
GRISSOM:
This is a good book,
Mr. Alvarado.

00:40:41,215 --> 00:40:45,552
Which Circle of Hell
would you be in?

00:40:45,619 --> 00:40:47,621
The Seventh, the outer one.

00:40:47,688 --> 00:40:52,092
Those who commit violence
against others.

00:40:54,895 --> 00:40:57,965
Souls plunge into a river
of boiling blood.

00:41:03,203 --> 00:41:05,005
(sniffs)

00:41:07,708 --> 00:41:09,943
Officer, do you have a lighter?

00:41:12,913 --> 00:41:15,082
No pen, no paper...

00:41:15,149 --> 00:41:18,986
so you used what you had, huh?

00:41:19,052 --> 00:41:20,687
<i>A book for paper,</i>

00:41:20,754 --> 00:41:24,358
<i>and for ink, urine.</i>

00:41:24,424 --> 00:41:26,660
Once the urine dries,

00:41:26,727 --> 00:41:30,964
the writing becomes
invisible....

00:41:31,031 --> 00:41:33,167
until it's heated,

00:41:33,233 --> 00:41:36,170
making the acid in the urine
turn brown.

00:41:39,439 --> 00:41:41,875
Then you, uh, put the book
back in the library,

00:41:41,942 --> 00:41:43,977
another prisoner checks it out,

00:41:44,044 --> 00:41:46,446
tears out the page,
gives it to a visitor,

00:41:46,513 --> 00:41:49,950
and you get your message out.

00:41:50,017 --> 00:41:51,985
Yes?

00:41:52,052 --> 00:41:55,122
Put him back
in his house.

00:41:56,356 --> 00:41:59,827
<i>Mira, usted se va a morir.</i>

00:42:04,231 --> 00:42:06,700
(door clanking shut)

00:42:17,511 --> 00:42:20,347
(sighs)

00:42:22,716 --> 00:42:25,752
Well, I was right
about Alvarado:

00:42:25,819 --> 00:42:27,621
he was leaving Vegas.

00:42:27,688 --> 00:42:30,724
Otherwise, he would have
killed me himself.

00:42:30,791 --> 00:42:32,793
You okay?

00:42:35,529 --> 00:42:37,231
Yeah.

00:42:37,297 --> 00:42:39,700
Guess now,
I owe you one, huh?

00:42:39,766 --> 00:42:42,769
I don't keep score,
Madeleine.

00:42:42,836 --> 00:42:46,006
You know what, Gilbert?

00:42:46,073 --> 00:42:50,777
You're the only man I know
who's never let me down.

00:42:50,844 --> 00:42:54,848
Which means that you're either
a classic enabler

00:42:54,915 --> 00:42:56,650
or my soul mate.

00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:18,572
(sighs)

00:43:21,608 --> 00:43:24,745
(phone rings)
