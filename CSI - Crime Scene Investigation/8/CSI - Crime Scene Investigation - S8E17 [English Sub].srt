Who's going to look

Well, it's not exactly
a new technique.


00:05:12,651 --> 00:05:15,820
In the 1920s, Joe Bonanno

Hi.

Get anything off that computer?

00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:51,625
No. Hard drive's
been wiped clean.

00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,396
Nothing but a couple of strips
from a folder

00:11:55,463 --> 00:11:57,631

But I got a court order

00:11:57,698 --> 00:11:59,333

00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,935

mostly family stuff.

00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:04,772

00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:06,173

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,008
The work account had an
online back-up system.

00:12:08,075 --> 00:12:09,977
That's what I'm in now.

00:12:10,044 --> 00:12:11,312
So you've basically gotten

00:12:11,378 --> 00:12:13,013

computer?

00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,182

HARPER:
All right,
so it's March 17, 2008.

00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:32,466
Meeting with Client #333.

00:12:32,533 --> 00:12:35,603
This was from inside
his Escalade, yesterday...

00:12:35,669 --> 00:12:38,272
GEDDA:
She did it with a cop.
I spit on her.

00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:40,808
She deserved what she got.

00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:43,210
HARPER:
That's as close to a confession
as you're gonna get.

00:12:43,277 --> 00:12:45,679
BROWN:
I'm gonna bury that guy, Lenny.

00:12:45,746 --> 00:12:48,382
I'm gonna bury him.

00:12:48,449 --> 00:12:49,784
Warrick couldn't
investigate Gedda himself,

00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:51,852
so he had the P.I.
do it for him.

00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:53,521
Archie tracked down
thousands of photos,

00:12:53,587 --> 00:12:55,756
sound byte files, videos.

00:12:55,823 --> 00:12:57,658
Everything's connected
to Lou Gedda.

00:12:57,725 --> 00:12:59,960
I think Gedda caught Harper 
spying on him, killed him

00:13:00,027 --> 00:13:02,329
and had the mortician
put the body in the
double-decker casket.

00:24:01,331 --> 00:24:04,101
That depends.

00:24:07,504 --> 00:24:09,072
Do you think I did it?

00:24:09,139 --> 00:24:13,410
I can't discuss the case.

00:24:13,477 --> 00:24:15,078
Yeah.

00:24:17,381 --> 00:24:19,650
I don't know, I think
I'd just feel a lot better

00:24:19,716 --> 00:24:21,418
if I had a change
of clothes.

00:24:21,485 --> 00:24:22,986
I hate being dressed
like a convict.

00:24:23,053 --> 00:24:25,155
I'll take care of it.

00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:27,691
Stay strong.

00:24:36,867 --> 00:24:38,468
(knock at window)

00:24:38,535 --> 00:24:39,770
DETECTIVE:
We're not
through yet.

00:24:39,837 --> 00:24:42,439
Okay, um...

00:24:42,506 --> 00:24:44,975
Let's... let's back
up a little bit.

00:24:45,042 --> 00:24:47,878
You get involved with
a pretty young thing.

00:24:47,945 --> 00:24:49,513
You go away to do
your business.

00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,215
She winds up dead.

00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:54,184
You ever think about that?

00:24:54,251 --> 00:24:56,520
I think about Joanna
every day.

00:24:56,587 --> 00:24:59,223
There's not a day that goes
by I don't think about her.

00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:00,757
No, I'm sorry.

00:25:00,824 --> 00:25:02,860
I was talking
about Holly Gribbs.

00:25:02,926 --> 00:25:07,397
You remember
Holly, don't you?

00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:11,034
Rookie CSI you left alone
at a crime scene eight years ago

00:25:11,101 --> 00:25:12,870
to go place bets
for a crooked judge.

00:25:12,936 --> 00:25:14,371
Suspect came back and shot her.

00:25:14,438 --> 00:25:15,806
I remember.

00:25:15,873 --> 00:25:17,074
Poor innocent girl

00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,042
just trying to do her job.

00:25:19,109 --> 00:25:21,345
She winds up dead
because of you.

00:25:21,411 --> 00:25:23,180
That has nothing
to do with this.

00:25:23,247 --> 00:25:24,581
Do two points make
a straight line?

00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:25,983
It's a pattern of behavior.

00:25:26,049 --> 00:25:28,151
Reckless, obsessive,

00:25:28,218 --> 00:25:32,022
<i>compulsive, self-destructive</i>
<i>behavior.</i>

00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:53,343
What are you
doing here?

00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:58,215
I just stopped by to get Warrick
a change of clothes.

00:25:58,282 --> 00:26:00,450
All right, take something
out of the drawers--

00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:01,618
nothing laid out

00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:03,554
or in the laundry.

00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,756
DETECTIVE:
<i>You get Holly killed,</i>

00:26:05,823 --> 00:26:07,024
then you get
Joanna killed.

00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:09,126
You just can't take
any more, so you kill Gedda.

00:26:09,193 --> 00:26:11,428
That's how a jury's
going to see it.

00:26:11,495 --> 00:26:13,263
There's nothing I can do
about that.

00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:15,465
Sure there is.

00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:18,635
Look, Lou Gedda was a slimeball.

00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:20,204
That's common
knowledge.

00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:22,439
Nobody's going
to miss him.

00:26:22,506 --> 00:26:25,309
In fact, the world is arguably
a better place without him.

00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:27,477
And so if I just
admit to killing him,

00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:28,912
they'll take it easy on me,

00:26:28,979 --> 00:26:30,747
and you're just trying to help
me out, right?

00:26:30,814 --> 00:26:33,317
You know how many times
I used that on a suspect?

00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:35,185
Don't waste your game, pal.

00:26:35,252 --> 00:26:36,220
Okay.

00:26:36,286 --> 00:26:37,554
You're a betting man.

00:26:37,621 --> 00:26:39,323
Given the circumstances,

00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:41,525
what do you think your odds
are right now?

00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:46,363
I want a lawyer.

00:26:50,601 --> 00:26:53,470
SIMMS:
<i>There were numerous</i>
<i>high-velocity blood stains</i>

00:26:53,537 --> 00:26:55,806
<i>on the front of CSI</i>
<i>Warrick Brown's shirt.</i>

00:26:55,873 --> 00:26:58,809
<i>Seven of these stains</i>
<i>were typed</i>

00:26:58,876 --> 00:27:01,445
<i>using 13 STR loci.</i>

00:27:01,512 --> 00:27:03,046
<i>All samples match</i>
<i>blood collected</i>

00:27:03,113 --> 00:27:05,182
<i>from Lou Gedda at autopsy...</i>

00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:08,151
DAWSON:
<i>The five expended</i>
<i>cartridge cases</i>

00:27:08,218 --> 00:27:10,587
<i>recovered at</i>
<i>Pigalle Boulevard</i>

00:27:10,654 --> 00:27:12,723
<i>were all fired in Warrick</i>
<i>Brown's service pistol...</i>

00:27:17,628 --> 00:27:19,630
<i>The bullets recovered</i>
<i>at autopsy</i>

00:27:19,696 --> 00:27:21,598
<i>and from the barber's chair</i>
<i>were fired from the same</i>

00:27:21,665 --> 00:27:23,133
<i>firearm, as well...</i>

00:27:24,835 --> 00:27:27,804
ROBBINS:
<i>Based on the clotting</i>
<i>of the facial lacerations</i>

00:27:27,871 --> 00:27:29,373
and development of the bruises

00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:30,974
on the victim's arms
and wrists...

00:27:31,041 --> 00:27:33,477
it appears he was bound
and beaten at least an hour

00:27:33,544 --> 00:27:34,945
prior to death...

00:27:36,647 --> 00:27:39,917
Okay, if this were
any other suspect,

00:27:39,983 --> 00:27:41,385
what would be our conclusion?

00:27:47,558 --> 00:27:49,092
That he did it.

00:27:49,159 --> 00:27:51,128
Which is what Warrick told
Internal Affairs.

00:27:51,195 --> 00:27:52,296
He confessed?

00:27:52,362 --> 00:27:54,164
No, but he didn't deny it.

00:27:54,231 --> 00:27:57,167
He says he can't remember.

00:27:57,234 --> 00:27:58,969
We've all heard that one before.

00:27:59,036 --> 00:28:01,104
What's that supposed to mean?

00:28:01,171 --> 00:28:02,773
It's not supposed
to mean anything.

00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,274
We're just talking.

00:28:04,341 --> 00:28:06,743
We can't just sit her
and watch him go down.

00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:09,112
WILLOWS:
We're not going to.

00:28:09,179 --> 00:28:10,581
He's asked for an attorney.

00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:12,015
We'll get him a shark.

00:28:12,082 --> 00:28:13,650
The only thing
the jury's going to see

00:28:13,717 --> 00:28:14,952
is a rogue cop

00:28:15,018 --> 00:28:16,687
with a vendetta.

00:28:16,753 --> 00:28:18,021
I've been there before.

00:28:18,088 --> 00:28:20,124
They're going to crucify him.

00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:21,959
Hey, guys, I'm sorry
to interrupt,

00:28:22,025 --> 00:28:23,460
but you need
to see this.

00:28:23,527 --> 00:28:26,363
There was chloroform in Lou
Gedda's blood and tissue.

00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:29,266
Chloroform gets metabolized
in the body pretty quickly,

00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:30,601
and it's excreted by breathing.

00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:32,736
Gedda must have been killed
soon after he was dosed.

00:28:32,803 --> 00:28:37,407
Warrick went in there
with a gun.

00:28:37,474 --> 00:28:40,310
Why would he use
chloroform if he was
going to shoot him?

00:28:40,377 --> 00:28:42,412
Maybe to subdue him
into the barber's chair.

00:28:42,479 --> 00:28:43,914
So he intended to torture him?

00:28:45,482 --> 00:28:47,584
No, not Warrick. No way.

00:28:47,651 --> 00:28:50,320
You know, chloroform
exposure can result

00:28:50,387 --> 00:28:52,222
in short term amnesia.

00:28:52,289 --> 00:28:53,423
Warrick says

00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:56,660
he can't remember anything
after going into Gedda's office.

00:28:56,727 --> 00:28:59,029
Where's the tox on Warrick?

00:28:59,096 --> 00:29:00,164
His blood wasn't drawn.

00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:01,698
Why not?

00:29:01,765 --> 00:29:04,134
The arrest report didn't note
any intoxication at the scene.

00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:06,069
I guess nobody saw
any reason to do it.

00:29:06,136 --> 00:29:07,738
Well, now there's a reason.

00:29:15,779 --> 00:29:17,581
Here, put this on.

00:29:17,648 --> 00:29:19,750
Okay.

00:29:19,817 --> 00:29:21,985
Henry did a comprehensive
drug test

00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:25,088
for chloroform,
along with a head space run

00:29:25,155 --> 00:29:26,523
for volatiles
and solvents.

00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:28,525
Everything came
back negative.

00:29:28,592 --> 00:29:30,294
HODGES:
Half-life of chloroform
in a human being

00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,728
is about 1.5 hours.

00:29:31,795 --> 00:29:35,265
It's virtually undetectable
in seven to ten hours.

00:29:35,332 --> 00:29:37,301
We drew the blood too late.

00:29:37,367 --> 00:29:39,269
It's still possible
Warrick was dosed.

00:29:39,336 --> 00:29:40,938
We just can't prove it.

00:29:41,004 --> 00:29:42,272
Nick, come here.

00:29:42,339 --> 00:29:43,674
Take a look at his shirt.

00:29:46,009 --> 00:29:47,444
See the voids in
the blood spatter

00:29:47,511 --> 00:29:49,413
around the armpits.

00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,747
STOKES:
Fabric must have been

00:29:50,814 --> 00:29:53,150
folded when the blood
was deposited.

00:29:53,217 --> 00:29:55,085
Looks like he had
something under his arms.

00:29:55,152 --> 00:29:56,587
Mm-hmm.

00:29:56,653 --> 00:30:00,157
Grab Hodges from behind--
under the armpits.

00:30:00,224 --> 00:30:02,759
Turn around.

00:30:02,826 --> 00:30:03,927
Dead weight, Hodges.
Slump down.

00:30:03,994 --> 00:30:05,162
Let him
hold you up.

00:30:05,229 --> 00:30:06,263
Okay, Nick...

00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:07,431
Raise his right arm.

00:30:07,498 --> 00:30:10,167
Pretend he's got
a gun in his hand.

00:30:13,537 --> 00:30:15,606
STOKES:
It's possible.

00:30:15,672 --> 00:30:17,207
I mean, if Warrick
were unconscious

00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:18,242
or semiconscious,

00:30:18,308 --> 00:30:20,577
he would have had
to have been supported.

00:30:20,644 --> 00:30:21,812
Well, based on the
high-velocity spatter

00:30:21,879 --> 00:30:23,514
on the shirt,

00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:26,817
the shooter would have
had to be within three feet

00:30:26,884 --> 00:30:28,418
of Gedda when
he fired.

00:30:28,485 --> 00:30:30,521
(hissing)

00:30:33,323 --> 00:30:34,458
(clearing throat)

00:30:34,525 --> 00:30:36,226
Take off the shirt.

00:30:39,596 --> 00:30:41,565
Thanks.

00:30:47,404 --> 00:30:48,839
Similar void
in the spatter pattern.

00:30:53,844 --> 00:30:55,546
STOKES:
It's consistent,
but not conclusive.

00:30:55,612 --> 00:30:56,880
There's probably a dozen

00:30:56,947 --> 00:30:59,483
different ways
to explain those voids.

00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:01,185
Doesn't rule Warrick out
as the shooter.

00:31:01,251 --> 00:31:04,521
But it gives an alternative
explanation of the evidence.

00:31:04,588 --> 00:31:06,356
And if we're right...

00:31:06,423 --> 00:31:08,292
Warrick was framed.

00:31:13,797 --> 00:31:16,099
I talked to a detective
at organized crime.

00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:18,068
He's sending over a
list of all the people

00:31:18,135 --> 00:31:19,570
that wanted Gedda dead.

00:31:19,636 --> 00:31:21,104
It's a long list.

00:31:21,171 --> 00:31:23,407
Cross-reference it to any
of Warrick's convictions

00:31:23,474 --> 00:31:25,042
who might have it
out for him.

00:31:25,108 --> 00:31:27,010
Maybe somebody's trying
to kill two birds
with one stone.

00:31:27,077 --> 00:31:28,212
Okay, I'm on it.

00:31:28,278 --> 00:31:29,446
Hey.

00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:31,515
Any unknown contributors
from the blood at the scene?

00:31:31,582 --> 00:31:33,717
No. They're all coming
back to the vic.

00:31:33,784 --> 00:31:36,086
Wendy and I are working
as fast as we can.

00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,365
We're striking out.

00:31:48,432 --> 00:31:50,367
There's no new evidence
from the scene

00:31:50,434 --> 00:31:52,536
that points to any
additional suspects.

00:31:52,603 --> 00:31:54,304
You got something?

00:31:57,808 --> 00:31:58,909
Handcuffs?

00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:00,744
Take a look
at the ligature marks.

00:32:00,811 --> 00:32:03,347
The width of the rails
on Warrick's cuffs

00:32:03,413 --> 00:32:06,216
are three millimeters narrower

00:32:06,283 --> 00:32:10,187
than the ligature marks.

00:32:10,254 --> 00:32:11,221
The ligature marks on Gedda

00:32:11,288 --> 00:32:13,157
didn't come from
Warrick's cuffs.

00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:18,033
So somebody switched
the handcuffs

00:32:18,099 --> 00:32:19,868
after Gedda was dead?

00:32:19,935 --> 00:32:22,103
Brass always suspected
that there was a mole

00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:24,739
in the department
that worked for Gedda.

00:32:24,806 --> 00:32:27,676
I bet we're looking
for a cop.

00:32:27,742 --> 00:32:31,179
A P.I. investigating Gedda
gets killed...

00:32:31,246 --> 00:32:33,415
then Gedda gets killed...

00:32:33,481 --> 00:32:37,352
Maybe this dirty cop
did them both.

00:32:37,419 --> 00:32:38,987
Yeah, but we can't prove it,

00:32:39,054 --> 00:32:41,223
'cause we're not allowed
to investigate Gedda's murder.

00:32:41,289 --> 00:32:43,291
We're still investigating
the P.I.

00:32:43,358 --> 00:32:45,260
If the cases are linked,

00:32:45,327 --> 00:32:48,964
we solve one,
we solve the other.

00:32:51,199 --> 00:32:53,335
Do your client and this
department a favor--

00:32:54,736 --> 00:32:59,608
The district attorney said
he might consider manslaughter.

00:32:59,674 --> 00:33:01,910
I can't do that.

00:33:01,977 --> 00:33:03,678
Are you telling me
you're innocent?

00:33:03,745 --> 00:33:07,282
Because I.A. said those words
never crossed your lips.

00:33:07,349 --> 00:33:09,384
Are you charging me?

00:33:09,451 --> 00:33:11,820
Not yet.

00:33:11,887 --> 00:33:14,656
But in about five hours, it's
gonna be first-degree murder.

00:33:17,225 --> 00:33:18,693
We got the link.

00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,829
Tox confirmed
traces of chloroform

00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:22,397
in the P.I.'s body.

00:33:22,464 --> 00:33:24,633
Had to have been the same
guy who killed Gedda.

00:33:24,699 --> 00:33:26,968
Well, that helps.

00:33:27,035 --> 00:33:28,637
Okay.
We got evidence logs

00:33:28,703 --> 00:33:30,972
and police files
from both scenes,

00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:34,309
but if a cop left trace
at either murder scene,

00:33:34,376 --> 00:33:35,644
we'd just write it off

00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:38,647
to normal investigator
contamination.

00:33:38,713 --> 00:33:39,648
Yeah.

00:33:39,714 --> 00:33:40,982
After he killed his victims,

00:33:41,049 --> 00:33:42,984
he could've even stayed
and handled the scene,

00:33:43,051 --> 00:33:45,153
made sure that he
hadn't missed anything.

00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:47,055

00:33:47,122 --> 00:33:49,891
Day Shift found prints

00:33:49,958 --> 00:33:52,060

at Gedda's office.

00:33:52,127 --> 00:33:54,729
Well, all three were
assigned to the scene.

Okay, but only four
signed the log.

00:34:05,607 --> 00:34:07,542
The unexplained print...

00:34:07,609 --> 00:34:11,613
belongs to...

00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,381
Officer Daniel Pritchard.

00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:21,890
His fingerprint was found...
on the casket.

00:34:21,957 --> 00:34:24,292
How does his

at the mortuary?

00:34:27,062 --> 00:34:28,396
I'm sorry, Captain.

00:34:28,463 --> 00:34:30,732
No one's seen Pritchard
since day before yesterday.

hold up in court?

00:35:33,595 --> 00:35:35,163
It will.
You know what

00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:37,499
the defense
is gonna say, right?

00:35:37,566 --> 00:35:40,063
who better than a CSI to make
a murder look like a frame?

00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:42,732

00:36:17,233 --> 00:36:19,469
Gedda has a mole
in the department.

00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:23,306
I'm ready to talk.

00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:26,643
He's on the way.

00:36:29,913 --> 00:36:31,514

Gedda!

00:36:31,581 --> 00:36:33,883

00:36:44,394 --> 00:36:45,728
A cop?

00:36:45,795 --> 00:36:47,197
Daniel Pritchard.

00:36:47,263 --> 00:36:48,932
We think that
he had him kill

00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:50,867
Lenny Harper,

00:36:50,934 --> 00:36:53,369
Probably Joanna Krumsky,
as well.

00:36:53,436 --> 00:36:55,972
Then why would
he kill Gedda?

00:36:56,039 --> 00:36:57,807
Who knows?

00:36:57,874 --> 00:36:59,709

00:37:03,546 --> 00:37:04,814
Come on, Grissom.

00:37:04,881 --> 00:37:07,650
Gedda's been killing
and barbecuing people

00:37:07,717 --> 00:37:10,120
for 25 years.

00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:14,190
It'd take more than a beat cop
to get over on that fat bastard.

00:37:14,257 --> 00:37:16,359
There's got to be somebody
higher up than that.

00:37:16,426 --> 00:37:18,561
Probably.

00:37:18,628 --> 00:37:20,864
But Pritchard's
all we got for now.

00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:22,031
He's in custody?

00:37:22,098 --> 00:37:23,166
Not yet.

00:37:23,233 --> 00:37:25,268
Hey, everything can't
go our way.

00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:30,073
The D.A.'s gonna
drop the charges.

00:37:32,442 --> 00:37:36,246
But there's still the question
of administrative violations.

00:37:36,312 --> 00:37:38,381
So Ecklie and I
are recommending

00:37:38,448 --> 00:37:39,816
to the undersheriff
that you be

00:37:39,883 --> 00:37:43,253

00:37:43,319 --> 00:37:45,155

00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:47,490
Well...

00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:49,692
the undersheriff says he 
has to think about it,

00:37:49,759 --> 00:37:52,896
but he just wants
to make you sweat.

00:37:52,962 --> 00:37:55,832
I've sweated enough, man.

00:37:55,899 --> 00:37:57,801
