00:00:02,083 --> 00:00:04,953
WOMAN:
<i>You can tell by the</i>
<i>neuro-intergalactic vibrations,</i>

00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:06,333
<i>the invasion's coming.</i>

00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:09,336
You know they're watching us
right now.

00:00:09,402 --> 00:00:10,737
These other dimensions--

00:00:10,804 --> 00:00:13,173
they're everywhere.

00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,076
And string--
it's obvious--

00:00:16,143 --> 00:00:19,312
string is the thing
that connects everything,

00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:23,216
and I'm not talking about
the stuff you can see: protons,

00:00:23,283 --> 00:00:25,218
photons, fig newtons,

00:00:25,285 --> 00:00:27,020
electrons,
neutrons

00:00:27,087 --> 00:00:29,689
and time...

00:00:29,756 --> 00:00:31,691
and space...

00:00:31,758 --> 00:00:33,026
Time <i>and</i> space?

00:00:33,093 --> 00:00:34,594
All right.
I'm thinking
probable cause...

00:00:34,661 --> 00:00:36,863
I see you,
turning your back on me,

00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,265
shaking your head.

00:00:38,331 --> 00:00:40,834
I can't help you.

00:00:40,901 --> 00:00:43,170
Ignore the truth
at your own peril, sir.

00:00:43,236 --> 00:00:45,038
At your own peril.

00:00:45,105 --> 00:00:47,407
Hi, see, we can't
see the strings

00:00:47,474 --> 00:00:49,743
'cause they're invisible,
but <i>they</i> can

00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:51,144
'cause they're the
11th dimension.

00:00:51,211 --> 00:00:53,113
Hey, you're ready
for them tonight, Evelyn.

00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:54,681
The invasion's tonight.

00:00:54,748 --> 00:00:57,417
Don't say I didn't warn you.

00:00:57,484 --> 00:00:59,386
What's the matter? Can't look?

00:00:59,452 --> 00:01:00,754
You know what that tells me?

00:01:00,821 --> 00:01:02,422
That you did it.

00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:05,959
You shot her, you
put a dress on her.

00:01:06,026 --> 00:01:07,894
I mean, the trooper
saw you put the body

00:01:07,961 --> 00:01:09,763
in the back of
your pickup truck.

00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:11,731
Anything else you did,
we're going to find out.

00:01:11,798 --> 00:01:14,801
That's what <i>he's</i> doing.

00:01:14,868 --> 00:01:17,771
And the body is in
autopsy right now.

00:01:21,074 --> 00:01:24,511
Oh, this must be
our Jane Doe.

00:01:24,578 --> 00:01:26,813
Doe, a deer.

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,948
A female deer.

00:01:28,014 --> 00:01:29,416
It's not funny.

00:01:29,483 --> 00:01:30,750
It's a little funny.

00:01:30,817 --> 00:01:32,452
Doc, I already
took photos.

00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:35,255
Not for <i>my</i> scrapbook,
you didn't.

00:01:35,322 --> 00:01:36,723
This is animal abuse.

00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:37,991
The killing, sure.

00:01:38,058 --> 00:01:39,426
The dress?

00:01:39,493 --> 00:01:42,195
Pet owners put sweaters
on chihuahuas.

00:01:42,262 --> 00:01:45,732
Just give me a hand
with the arrow.

00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,976
Hmm, it's not an arrow;
it's a bolt

00:01:56,042 --> 00:01:57,444
shot from a crossbow.

00:01:58,812 --> 00:02:01,014
(sniffs)
Alcohol.

00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:04,184
You think he had
to get her liquored up?

00:02:04,251 --> 00:02:06,153
Okay, so you
got a DUI,

00:02:06,219 --> 00:02:07,354
resisting arrest,

00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:11,057
several new and unique
wildlife violations.

00:02:11,124 --> 00:02:13,927
You're in a truckload
of trouble, Kyle.

00:02:13,994 --> 00:02:17,697
I... I...
I found her like that.

00:02:17,764 --> 00:02:19,266
In a cocktail dress?

00:02:19,332 --> 00:02:22,536
(laughs)

00:02:22,602 --> 00:02:24,771
I didn't put
no dress on her.

00:02:24,838 --> 00:02:27,674
Oh, no, no, no...
see, I was...

00:02:27,741 --> 00:02:30,610
I was taking her to the vet.

00:02:30,677 --> 00:02:32,379
You sure it wasn't
a nightclub?

00:02:32,445 --> 00:02:35,182
Then how do you explain
the crossbow I found

00:02:35,248 --> 00:02:36,550
in your truck
there, boss?

00:02:36,616 --> 00:02:38,885
Easy. Somebody put it there.

00:02:38,952 --> 00:02:41,888
Okay, take a deep breath
for me now.

00:02:41,955 --> 00:02:44,491
Blow into this.

00:02:46,126 --> 00:02:47,260
Come on, guys. I mean, can't...

00:02:47,327 --> 00:02:48,662
can't you give me a break here?

00:02:48,728 --> 00:02:50,397
I mean, look,
no, here...

00:02:50,464 --> 00:02:52,566
I... I... I just got a...

00:02:52,632 --> 00:02:54,334
I got a divorce,

00:02:54,401 --> 00:02:56,036
right, and my ex

00:02:56,102 --> 00:02:58,238
just cleaned me out.

00:02:58,305 --> 00:02:59,940
Let me guess: her name is Bambi.

00:03:01,141 --> 00:03:04,010
Blow!
(inhales)

00:03:04,077 --> 00:03:06,379
(exhaling)

00:03:14,488 --> 00:03:15,622
Stop him!

00:03:29,136 --> 00:03:30,403
(grunts)

00:03:31,771 --> 00:03:33,707
Move, move, move!
Get out of the way!

00:03:33,773 --> 00:03:34,808
Get out of the way!

00:03:35,809 --> 00:03:37,144
(groaning)

00:03:40,514 --> 00:03:42,782
(groaning)

00:03:43,783 --> 00:03:44,751
Hey!

00:03:44,818 --> 00:03:46,720
Hey, hey, hey, citizens arrest!

00:03:51,258 --> 00:03:52,259
Light him up.

00:03:55,695 --> 00:03:58,465
(screaming)

00:04:01,434 --> 00:04:05,071

Stun guns aren't

00:04:48,652 --> 00:04:50,454
just <i>less</i> lethal.

00:04:53,757 --> 00:04:56,760
AFID tags confirm
it was Officer Choi's weapon.

00:04:58,328 --> 00:05:01,231
You know, I
don't get it.

00:05:01,298 --> 00:05:04,067
Suspect makes a break for it,
clocks a couple of unis,

00:05:04,134 --> 00:05:05,602
gets pepper-sprayed,

00:05:05,669 --> 00:05:07,571
and keeps going.

00:05:07,638 --> 00:05:09,673
Pepper spray doesn't always stop
them when they're really drunk.

00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,176
Suspect blew a .28.

00:05:12,242 --> 00:05:14,578
Oh, well, maybe he
was a sloppy drunk.

00:05:14,645 --> 00:05:16,213
Any alcohol
on his clothes?

00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,949
He'd been in PD for hours.
Alcohol would have evaporated.

00:05:19,016 --> 00:05:20,451
STOKES:
I'm gonna need your stun gun.

00:05:20,517 --> 00:05:21,685
Am I in trouble?

00:05:21,752 --> 00:05:23,754
When was the last time
you had this thing serviced?

00:05:23,821 --> 00:05:25,856
Not since I've been
on the force.

00:05:25,923 --> 00:05:27,224
That's only
six months now.

00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:29,860
We'll have it analyzed,
see if it was malfunctioning.

00:05:29,927 --> 00:05:32,296
That's the first time
I had to shoot it.

00:05:32,362 --> 00:05:33,330
Relax, man.

00:05:33,397 --> 00:05:35,532
You were following
captain's orders.

00:05:35,599 --> 00:05:37,668
When you talk to IA,
just be honest...

00:05:37,734 --> 00:05:38,902
and don't expect a hug.

00:05:38,969 --> 00:05:40,404
That's when you said
to your officer,

00:05:40,471 --> 00:05:42,106
I quote, "Light him up."

00:05:42,172 --> 00:05:43,907
Poor choice of words.

00:05:43,974 --> 00:05:44,975
We followed the
proper procedure

00:05:45,042 --> 00:05:46,143
for escalation
of force.

00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:47,644
I mean, at least
we didn't shoot him.

00:05:47,711 --> 00:05:48,879
Of course, that
would have killed him.

00:05:48,946 --> 00:05:50,481
As far as my office
is concerned,

00:05:50,547 --> 00:05:52,749
we got an in-custody death
on your orders.

00:05:52,816 --> 00:05:54,685
Doesn't get much worse.
Look, we use
stun guns

00:05:54,751 --> 00:05:56,920
all the time around here;
this is the first one

00:05:56,987 --> 00:05:58,055
that caught
on fire.

00:05:58,122 --> 00:05:59,456
What do you think?

00:05:59,523 --> 00:06:01,258
Maybe this guy had so much booze
it made him a Roman candle?

00:06:01,325 --> 00:06:04,661
Well, unfortunately,
human blood is 83% water.

00:06:04,728 --> 00:06:05,662
It's just not flammable,

00:06:05,729 --> 00:06:07,765
no matter how
drunk you are.

00:06:07,831 --> 00:06:11,301
That's too bad.
Might have let you off the hook.

00:06:14,571 --> 00:06:18,375
Together in death,
as they were in life.

00:06:18,442 --> 00:06:20,177
Guy abuses wildlife

00:06:20,244 --> 00:06:21,779
and then bursts
into flames.

00:06:21,845 --> 00:06:23,313
I call it karma.

00:06:24,548 --> 00:06:26,750
There are no physical signs
their relationship

00:06:26,817 --> 00:06:28,519
was anything
other than platonic.

00:06:28,585 --> 00:06:30,020
I mean, we're the
ones encroaching

00:06:30,087 --> 00:06:33,123
on <i>their</i> habitat--
you don't see <i>them</i> shooting <i>us.</i>

00:06:34,258 --> 00:06:37,461
Consider this justice
for Bambi's mother.

00:06:55,479 --> 00:06:56,580
Light him up.

00:07:04,588 --> 00:07:05,956
This is the rest of the stuff

00:07:06,023 --> 00:07:07,658
that we got
from the dead guy's truck.

00:07:11,228 --> 00:07:13,931
One crossbow.

00:07:13,997 --> 00:07:18,669
Same bolts we recovered
from the dead deer.

00:07:18,735 --> 00:07:21,338
Couple of mason jars.

00:07:22,739 --> 00:07:25,109
Whew! Moonshine.

00:07:25,175 --> 00:07:26,343
Home brew.

00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:27,778
Firewater.

00:07:27,845 --> 00:07:30,347
Grain alcohol's 190 proof,
you know?

00:07:30,414 --> 00:07:31,915
That's 95%
alcohol.

00:07:31,982 --> 00:07:33,584
Who was he trying to forget?

00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:35,652
Well, Brass said
that he'd just gotten divorced.

00:07:35,719 --> 00:07:37,754
Welcome to the club.

00:07:37,821 --> 00:07:39,923
You see any night-vision goggles

00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:41,959
or, uh, spotlights in that box?

00:07:42,025 --> 00:07:43,827
No, why?

00:07:43,894 --> 00:07:45,562
Well...

00:07:45,629 --> 00:07:48,332
I think he must have shot
the deer during the day

00:07:48,398 --> 00:07:50,834
and then waited until dark
to put her in his truck.

00:07:50,901 --> 00:07:54,071
That's a long time just sitting
out in the woods drinking.

00:07:54,138 --> 00:07:55,572
Stun gun
checks out.

00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:56,740
Operates
as designed.

00:07:56,807 --> 00:07:57,841
Puts out
the standard

00:07:57,908 --> 00:07:59,676
50,000 volts.

00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:01,645
Well, that eliminates
one variable.

00:08:01,712 --> 00:08:03,480
Leaves us
with the shirt,

00:08:03,547 --> 00:08:07,484
the grain alcohol,
and the pepper spray.

00:08:07,551 --> 00:08:09,052
Time to find out
if one of those

00:08:09,119 --> 00:08:10,120
made him
catch on fire.

00:08:12,723 --> 00:08:14,158
Don't tase me, bro.

00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:16,660
Don't tempt me.

00:08:56,867 --> 00:08:59,736

STOKES:
That's Evelyn.

00:09:07,644 --> 00:09:09,546

to PD at some point,

00:09:12,216 --> 00:09:14,518
and she files a complaint
against <i>them.</i>

00:09:14,585 --> 00:09:16,420
What did <i>them</i> do to <i>her?</i>

00:09:16,487 --> 00:09:17,554
Everything,

from stealing her thoughts
to raping her,

00:09:19,957 --> 00:09:21,925
but even if she
is crazy,

00:09:21,992 --> 00:09:23,594
she's a variable in all this.

00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:27,331
See, there may have been
some sort of transfer

00:09:27,397 --> 00:09:28,398
between her

00:09:28,465 --> 00:09:30,367
She didn't stick around

Well, can you
blame her?

00:09:32,236 --> 00:09:36,073
She just witnessed
spontaneous alien combustion.

00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,208
And you didn't hold her.
No.

00:09:38,275 --> 00:09:41,111
Did you get a statement?

00:09:41,178 --> 00:09:43,680
Where is she now?

00:09:43,747 --> 00:09:45,449
We don't know.

00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,755
The coffee machine's
going to break down;

00:09:51,822 --> 00:09:54,558
some tourist is
going to swear

00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:56,527
the hooker
was over 18;

00:09:56,593 --> 00:09:58,662
and Evelyn's going to show up.

00:09:58,729 --> 00:10:00,364
We got a broadcast out.

00:10:00,431 --> 00:10:01,765
We'll find her.

00:10:01,832 --> 00:10:03,767
She's very shiny.

00:10:15,112 --> 00:10:17,481
It's gotta be getting hot
under all that foil.

00:10:17,548 --> 00:10:19,149
She's going to cook
out here fast.

00:10:19,216 --> 00:10:21,318
Aw...

00:10:21,385 --> 00:10:23,086
Evelyn.

00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,160
What happened?

00:10:30,227 --> 00:10:31,428
The driver...

00:10:31,495 --> 00:10:32,830
<i>said his shift was over.</i>

00:10:32,896 --> 00:10:35,332
<i>He was just taking the truck</i>
<i>back to the yard.</i>

00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:38,368
Said a flash of light
came out of nowhere.

00:10:40,704 --> 00:10:43,340
(tires screeching)

00:10:43,407 --> 00:10:46,577
The sun was
just coming up.

00:10:46,643 --> 00:10:48,512
Reflection off of her suit
must have blinded him.

00:10:49,947 --> 00:10:52,950
Okay, well, this tin foil's
evidence in two cases now,

00:10:53,016 --> 00:10:54,952
so we've got to be
careful with it.

00:10:57,054 --> 00:11:00,190
Butane lighter.

00:11:00,257 --> 00:11:01,925
It's cracked.

00:11:01,992 --> 00:11:03,327
Looks empty.

00:11:03,393 --> 00:11:04,761
That could be what

00:11:04,828 --> 00:11:06,330
lit the flame
in your deer hunter.

00:11:06,396 --> 00:11:07,965
I'll check the foil
for butane.

00:11:08,031 --> 00:11:10,968
Trouble is, it's probably
evaporated by now.

00:11:11,034 --> 00:11:14,004
200 bucks.

00:11:14,071 --> 00:11:15,038
Okay, turn her over, Dave.

00:11:15,105 --> 00:11:16,874
Sure.

00:11:20,277 --> 00:11:22,813
Guys. We got some
green fluid here.

00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,115
It's coming
from the wound.

00:11:25,182 --> 00:11:26,550
STOKES:
Damn!

00:11:26,617 --> 00:11:28,318
I think that's blood.

00:11:32,356 --> 00:11:34,358

00:11:54,978 --> 00:11:56,079
SANDERS:
Take a look.

00:11:56,146 --> 00:11:57,581
You're not going
to believe it.

00:11:59,716 --> 00:12:01,552
Another 419
with green blood.

00:12:01,618 --> 00:12:03,854
What are the odds?

00:12:05,055 --> 00:12:07,157
That he's not connected
to our first victim?

00:12:07,224 --> 00:12:08,592
Astronomical.

00:12:08,659 --> 00:12:09,625
Looks like blunt-force trauma

00:12:09,692 --> 00:12:11,627
to me.

00:12:11,694 --> 00:12:13,463
GRISSOM:
You know, Tin Foil Lady was

00:12:13,529 --> 00:12:14,731
run over just a few
blocks from here.

00:12:14,797 --> 00:12:17,767
I bet this area was home
to both of them.

00:12:35,251 --> 00:12:36,586
Three pairs of sunglasses?

00:12:45,995 --> 00:12:47,563
Earplugs.

00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:50,299
That, David, is how you make it

00:12:50,366 --> 00:12:53,136
dark and quiet

SANDERS:
Hey!

00:13:04,247 --> 00:13:05,481
I think I found
the weapon!

00:13:07,817 --> 00:13:10,620
We should be able to get
some good prints off it.

00:13:26,736 --> 00:13:29,572
I've seen green blood before,
but only from bodies

00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:31,641
in advanced stages of decomp.

00:13:33,676 --> 00:13:35,211
What do you think
turned it green?

00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:37,613
I suspect it might be sulfur.

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,550
Hmm, sulfur's
a naturally occurring
component of blood.

00:13:40,616 --> 00:13:42,819
Yes, but in massive doses
it tends to turn the blood

00:13:42,885 --> 00:13:45,755
a blackish avocado green.

00:13:45,822 --> 00:13:49,692
<i>When the sulfur atom joins</i>
<i>the hemoglobin molecules,</i>

00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:50,993
<i>red blood turns green.</i>

00:13:52,195 --> 00:13:54,397
Which is why First Officer
Spock's blood

00:13:54,464 --> 00:13:55,431
is green in <i>Star Trek.</i>

00:13:55,498 --> 00:13:56,799
No, it's not.

00:13:56,866 --> 00:13:58,434
Uh, yes, it is.

00:13:58,501 --> 00:14:00,436
Trust me.
I'm an expert.

00:14:00,503 --> 00:14:02,505
Well, apparently not,
because otherwise you would

00:14:02,572 --> 00:14:05,308
surely know that
the oxidizing agent
in Vulcan blood is copper.

00:14:05,374 --> 00:14:07,510
And that is why
his blood is green.

00:14:08,578 --> 00:14:09,712
Well, it was that and the fact

00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:11,347
that he had a Vulcan father,
since his mother

00:14:11,414 --> 00:14:13,349
was actually human.

00:14:13,834 --> 00:14:15,136
And furthermore,

00:14:15,203 --> 00:14:18,472
he was promoted to Captain
just prior to <i>Star Trek II</i>

00:14:18,539 --> 00:14:21,008
and then he retired
as civilian ambassador.

00:14:22,043 --> 00:14:24,011
You're like a geeky, nerdy guy

00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:25,479
trapped in a woman's body.

00:14:25,546 --> 00:14:27,215
So are you.

00:14:31,052 --> 00:14:34,121
Well, as I was saying,

00:14:34,188 --> 00:14:35,690
here on Earth,

00:14:35,756 --> 00:14:38,693
sulfur-containing compounds
could turn

00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:40,862
otherwise normal blood green.

00:14:47,034 --> 00:14:48,369
As I suspected.

00:14:48,436 --> 00:14:50,705
What? Share.

00:14:53,207 --> 00:14:54,575
She wasn't a Vulcan.

00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:58,112
Thank you.

00:15:03,184 --> 00:15:04,986
I don't want to take
all the credit,

00:15:05,052 --> 00:15:06,120
but I do know why both

00:15:06,187 --> 00:15:07,388
your victims
have green blood.

00:15:07,455 --> 00:15:08,723
High levels of sulfur.

00:15:08,789 --> 00:15:11,025
(sighs):
Yes.

00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,095
Did you identify the source yet?

00:15:14,161 --> 00:15:15,463
Not yet.
I'll get the blood

00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:16,631
over to Henry and have him run

00:15:16,697 --> 00:15:19,000
a tox panel
for sulfuric compounds.

00:15:19,066 --> 00:15:21,202
Oh, and even if your

00:15:21,269 --> 00:15:23,070
tin foil lady
was gushing blood,

00:15:23,137 --> 00:15:24,272
it would not have contributed

00:15:24,338 --> 00:15:25,406
to your stun gun guy's
immolation.

00:15:25,473 --> 00:15:27,642
Did you find anything
on the foil?

00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:29,477
Bacon grease and trace amounts
of ketchup.

00:15:29,544 --> 00:15:31,379
Both things you would
find at a barbeque,

00:15:31,445 --> 00:15:33,214
but not the kind that
you're dealing with.

00:15:33,281 --> 00:15:35,049
(knocking)

00:15:35,116 --> 00:15:36,217
Brass just called.

00:15:36,284 --> 00:15:38,019
Our lonely
deer hunter's parents just

00:15:38,085 --> 00:15:39,153
hired a lawyer.

00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,521
The department's
going to be sued.

00:15:40,588 --> 00:15:41,522
We haven't even released

00:15:41,589 --> 00:15:42,790
the case details yet.

00:15:42,857 --> 00:15:44,091
Our investigation's

00:15:44,158 --> 00:15:45,193
still ongoing.

00:15:45,259 --> 00:15:47,428
Well, they got something
we don't.

00:15:47,495 --> 00:15:49,430
Move! Move! Move!

00:15:49,497 --> 00:15:50,765
Get away! Get away!

00:15:50,831 --> 00:15:52,466

STOKES:
Here,

00:15:58,105 --> 00:16:00,107
on the PD surveillance,

00:16:00,174 --> 00:16:02,143
this ambulance chaser
on his cell phone--

00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:03,411
he's a regular.

00:16:03,477 --> 00:16:06,080
Want to bet he's the one
that shot the footage?

00:16:06,147 --> 00:16:07,949
Want to bet he's
the one filing suit?

00:16:08,015 --> 00:16:09,550
Well, his cell phone
has a better angle

00:16:09,617 --> 00:16:12,453
than the PD
surveillance camera.

00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,889
Archie, run this back
to where he gets sprayed.

00:16:14,956 --> 00:16:16,157
(typing)

00:16:17,124 --> 00:16:18,860
Get away!
Wait a minute.

00:16:18,926 --> 00:16:20,261
Tighten up on the can.

00:16:21,996 --> 00:16:24,131
Nick, when we did
the experiment

00:16:24,198 --> 00:16:25,867
with Jell-O Man,

00:16:25,933 --> 00:16:29,270
we used pepper spray
from a red can, right?

00:16:29,337 --> 00:16:31,372
Yeah. Yeah,
department-issue.

00:16:31,439 --> 00:16:32,440
Got it through Logistics.

00:16:32,506 --> 00:16:34,108
That one's yellow.

00:16:37,845 --> 00:16:40,748
I've used my pepper spray half
a dozen times on the street.

00:16:40,815 --> 00:16:43,251
All I had to do was write
a use-of-force memo.

00:16:43,317 --> 00:16:44,652
BRASS:
Speaking of memos,
didn't you get the one

00:16:44,719 --> 00:16:46,487
we issued
about five years ago?

00:16:47,522 --> 00:16:49,123
I know what you mean.
Yeah, you know,

00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:50,525
when the department
switched over

00:16:50,591 --> 00:16:51,792
to water-based pepper spray.

00:16:51,859 --> 00:16:54,228
STOKES:
This one uses isobutane.

00:16:54,295 --> 00:16:56,998
Compressed gas,
highly flammable stuff.

00:16:57,064 --> 00:16:57,899
Where's yours?

00:16:57,965 --> 00:16:59,834
It's Murphy's Law, right?

00:16:59,901 --> 00:17:01,335
I always got my gear together,

00:17:01,402 --> 00:17:02,537
wired tight,
but last night

00:17:02,603 --> 00:17:04,105
my girl takes
my pepper spray.

00:17:04,171 --> 00:17:06,140
And I don't blame her
because she's got
a dangerous job.

00:17:06,207 --> 00:17:07,308
Oh, yeah? What does she do?

00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:09,710
She goes to WLVU
during the day.

00:17:09,777 --> 00:17:12,680
She studies kinesiology,
but she dances nights

00:17:12,747 --> 00:17:13,848
at the Acid Strip.

00:17:13,915 --> 00:17:15,116
(chuckles)

00:17:15,183 --> 00:17:17,752
What does she clip
the can to, her G-string?

00:17:17,818 --> 00:17:20,354
It'd be a deterrent to stuffing
a tip in there, wouldn't it?

00:17:20,421 --> 00:17:22,356
Come on; she walks
to the parking lot

00:17:22,423 --> 00:17:24,125
alone at 4:00 a.m.

00:17:24,192 --> 00:17:26,561
Okay, so she takes
your department-issue,

00:17:26,627 --> 00:17:28,029
so what'd you do?
Pick up an old can

00:17:28,095 --> 00:17:29,430
lying around?
No, bought one

00:17:29,497 --> 00:17:31,098
at Catalani's Gun World
on the way in.

00:17:31,165 --> 00:17:32,433
I didn't get a chance
to change it out.

00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,335
Does it really matter?

00:17:34,402 --> 00:17:36,037
It might.

00:17:36,103 --> 00:17:38,105
(misting)

00:18:06,567 --> 00:18:08,236
(laughs)

00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:26,501
Hey, Greg.

00:18:26,568 --> 00:18:27,869
I just ran your pipe
over to Prints

00:18:27,936 --> 00:18:29,637
after I sampled it
for blood.

00:18:29,704 --> 00:18:30,672
Yeah, did you find
something wrong?

00:18:30,739 --> 00:18:32,173
I found something weird.

00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,608
One end of the pipe
was covered

00:18:33,675 --> 00:18:34,809
with blood
from the victim.

00:18:34,876 --> 00:18:36,544
Yeah, the administrator
at the shelter

00:18:36,611 --> 00:18:38,079
ID'd him as
Wayne Connor, homeless.

00:18:38,146 --> 00:18:39,514
Well, then on the other
end of the pipe,

00:18:39,581 --> 00:18:42,016
I found several small blood
smears from an unknown donor.

00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:43,685
So the killer
was also injured.

00:18:43,752 --> 00:18:46,721
Mm-hmm.
His blood's green, too.

00:18:47,756 --> 00:18:49,557

HODGES:
Winston Churchill?
Ian Fleming.

00:18:55,764 --> 00:18:57,232
I should know that.

00:18:57,298 --> 00:18:58,833
I'm a huge James Bond fan.

00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,903
What aren't
you a fan of?

00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:04,272
I ran the green bloods
for sulfur-containing compounds.

00:19:04,339 --> 00:19:06,174
Still working
on the third donor,

00:19:06,241 --> 00:19:08,676
but Evelyn Polychronopolous
and Wayne Connor

00:19:08,743 --> 00:19:11,413
both had high levels
of thiocyte in their systems.

00:19:11,479 --> 00:19:13,548
Prescription medication
for migraines.

00:19:13,615 --> 00:19:15,316
ANDREWS:
I checked with the
downtown pharmacies.

00:19:15,383 --> 00:19:16,384
They don't dispense it.

00:19:16,451 --> 00:19:19,120
154 nanograms per milliliter--

00:19:19,187 --> 00:19:20,622
that's overdose levels.

00:19:20,688 --> 00:19:22,090
Even if they were

00:19:22,157 --> 00:19:23,958
in a clinical trial,
they wouldn't get that much.

00:19:24,025 --> 00:19:26,194
It's not a typical
drug of abuse.
GRISSOM:
Yeah, but if you've got

00:19:26,261 --> 00:19:27,862
a migraine, you'll do anything
to stop the pain.

00:19:27,929 --> 00:19:29,731
How do you know
they had migraines?

00:19:29,798 --> 00:19:31,966
Well, aside from the medication,
Connor was wearing

00:19:32,033 --> 00:19:34,736
three pairs of sunglasses
and earplugs.

00:19:34,803 --> 00:19:37,038
Photo- and phonosensitivity
are symptoms

00:19:37,105 --> 00:19:38,173
of migraines.

00:19:38,239 --> 00:19:40,241
Maybe that's why
Evelyn thought "they"

00:19:40,308 --> 00:19:41,409
were invading
her brain.

00:19:41,476 --> 00:19:42,510
She was killed only

00:19:42,577 --> 00:19:43,812
a few blocks
from the vacant lot

00:19:43,878 --> 00:19:45,480
with a couple hundred dollars
on her.

00:19:45,547 --> 00:19:47,048
She could have been on her way

00:19:47,115 --> 00:19:49,951
to a drug buy.
So if we can figure out
who's selling the drugs,

00:19:50,018 --> 00:19:52,020
it may lead us
to who killed Connor.

00:19:54,556 --> 00:19:56,424
(siren chirps)

00:20:00,362 --> 00:20:01,629
Damn busy day.

00:20:01,696 --> 00:20:03,398
Hmm, where are they?

00:20:03,465 --> 00:20:04,966
Inside, end of the hall.

00:20:05,033 --> 00:20:07,235
Mailman got worried
when they didn't come
to the door.

00:20:07,302 --> 00:20:09,571
We did a welfare check,
found them both in the bed.

00:20:09,637 --> 00:20:11,139
Doc.

00:20:11,206 --> 00:20:12,240
ROBBINS:
Catherine.

00:20:12,307 --> 00:20:15,243
No forced entry; no sign

00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:17,679
of trauma;
bodies don't look posed.

00:20:17,746 --> 00:20:20,548
No gas odor,
no petechiae.

00:20:20,615 --> 00:20:22,784
No sign of suffocation.

00:20:22,851 --> 00:20:23,852
So why'd you call CSI?

00:20:23,918 --> 00:20:25,754
Couple in their late 60s.

00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:26,921
What are the chances
they died

00:20:26,988 --> 00:20:28,723
of natural causes
at the same time?

00:20:36,398 --> 00:20:38,600
"Digoxin.

00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:41,202
"Warfarin.

00:20:41,269 --> 00:20:42,971
Amiodarone."

00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:46,508
Those are all heart medications.
Mm-hmm.

00:20:48,043 --> 00:20:50,011
"Zolpidem."

00:20:50,078 --> 00:20:51,780
That's for sleep.
I know.

00:20:51,846 --> 00:20:53,014
Bottle's almost full.

00:20:53,081 --> 00:20:54,282
No foaming
at the mouth,

00:20:54,349 --> 00:20:56,518
no note left behind.

00:20:56,584 --> 00:20:58,053
I don't think
this is a double suicide.

00:20:59,921 --> 00:21:02,057
Suspicious circs.

00:21:02,123 --> 00:21:04,059
Good call.

00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:06,061
They look like
they loved each other.

00:21:06,127 --> 00:21:07,362
(knocking)

00:21:12,934 --> 00:21:14,936
CATHERINE:
Looks like <i>Caddyshack</i> back here.

00:21:15,003 --> 00:21:16,137
Invasion
of the ground squirrels.

00:21:16,204 --> 00:21:17,806
(shutter clicks)

00:21:17,872 --> 00:21:19,741
Yeah, I got a few casualties
out here.

00:21:19,808 --> 00:21:21,409
I see.

00:21:21,476 --> 00:21:23,912
What the hell is that?

00:21:23,978 --> 00:21:25,647
Looks like
a close encounter, right?

00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:35,290
"Atomic Dave's
Painless Removals."

00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:38,526
Some kind of pest control gizmo.

00:21:38,593 --> 00:21:39,894
Apparently, it works.

00:21:39,961 --> 00:21:41,262
I don't think
the squirrels

00:21:41,329 --> 00:21:44,065
would agree
that it's painless, though.

00:21:48,336 --> 00:21:51,172
Shrodinger Martin?

00:21:51,239 --> 00:21:52,173
(chuckles)

00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,744
He had a cat named Shrodinger.

00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:58,012
Must have been
into physics.

00:21:58,079 --> 00:21:59,280
Cat grave.

00:21:59,347 --> 00:22:00,348
(chuckles)

00:22:00,415 --> 00:22:02,417
Dead cat, dead
critters, dead couple.

00:22:02,484 --> 00:22:04,419
(clanking loudly)

00:22:04,486 --> 00:22:07,088
(power tool running)

00:22:16,431 --> 00:22:19,300
Imagine living next door
to that racket.

00:22:30,011 --> 00:22:32,313
WOMAN:
<i>Last night?</i>

00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:35,050
I was in my studio.

00:22:35,116 --> 00:22:37,986
I'm an artist.

00:22:38,053 --> 00:22:40,288
Didn't your neighbors
complain about the noise?

00:22:40,355 --> 00:22:41,289
(chuckles)

00:22:41,356 --> 00:22:43,591
I don't weld at night.

00:22:43,658 --> 00:22:45,360
I work on my jewelry.

00:22:45,427 --> 00:22:46,995
High-end stuff.

00:22:47,062 --> 00:22:48,430
Nice.

00:22:48,496 --> 00:22:51,066
Listen, how well did you know
your neighbors, the Martins?

00:22:51,132 --> 00:22:52,500
Are they dead?

00:22:52,567 --> 00:22:53,501
Yeah.

00:22:53,568 --> 00:22:54,903
They passed away last night.

00:22:54,969 --> 00:22:56,471
Hardly knew them.

00:22:56,538 --> 00:22:58,006
Heard he was
a, uh...

00:22:58,073 --> 00:22:59,941
(grunting):
...professor or something.

00:23:00,008 --> 00:23:01,810
Yeah, we really didn't have
too much in common.

00:23:01,876 --> 00:23:02,911
Well, apparently,

00:23:02,977 --> 00:23:05,346
you both shared a
ground squirrel problem.

00:23:05,413 --> 00:23:06,981
(sighs)

00:23:07,048 --> 00:23:08,616
Could be worse, I guess.

00:23:08,683 --> 00:23:10,852
I could still be
with my deadbeat ex.

00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:12,320
There's a pest

00:23:12,387 --> 00:23:14,422
I did get rid of.

00:23:14,489 --> 00:23:15,990
ROBBINS:
Hey, Catherine.

00:23:16,057 --> 00:23:17,359
Hi.

00:23:17,425 --> 00:23:18,426
What a relief.

00:23:18,493 --> 00:23:20,128
Two red-blooded Americans.

00:23:20,195 --> 00:23:22,030
According
to his stomach contents,

00:23:22,097 --> 00:23:25,967
he likes a glass
of red wine with his pasta.

00:23:27,602 --> 00:23:30,939
Looks like suppertime
was about four hours premortem.

00:23:31,005 --> 00:23:33,041
Take a look at
the light board.

00:23:35,043 --> 00:23:37,212
Both Martins
wore pacemakers.

00:23:37,278 --> 00:23:38,580
Mrs. Martin's
is in that bowl.

00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:43,785
(ticking)

00:23:43,852 --> 00:23:47,055
Takes a licking
and keeps on ticking.

00:23:47,122 --> 00:23:49,124
Yeah, I hope mine's
still working when I pop off.

00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:51,359
You wear a pacemaker?

00:23:51,426 --> 00:23:54,529
Bradycardia-- slow heart.

00:23:54,596 --> 00:23:58,199
Every once in a while, just to
make sure I don't skip a beat,

00:23:58,266 --> 00:24:00,001
the pacer kicks in,

00:24:00,068 --> 00:24:02,070
just like this one.

00:24:02,137 --> 00:24:04,039
Well, obviously,
they didn't die

00:24:04,105 --> 00:24:05,807
of pacer malfunction.

00:24:05,874 --> 00:24:08,276
(beeping)

00:24:10,311 --> 00:24:11,746
What you got?

00:24:11,813 --> 00:24:13,248
Check this out.

00:24:13,314 --> 00:24:16,084
It's like having a witness
to his death inside his body.

00:24:16,151 --> 00:24:19,387
There's no interruption in his
pacemaker functions, but...

00:24:19,454 --> 00:24:20,889
about eight hours
before he died,

00:24:20,955 --> 00:24:23,591
there was a spike
in his heart rate.

00:24:23,658 --> 00:24:26,361
His wife's
is almost identical,

00:24:26,428 --> 00:24:28,196
so something got
their hearts racing.

00:24:28,263 --> 00:24:30,098
Who knows?
Maybe they, uh,

00:24:30,165 --> 00:24:32,400
enjoyed a little
afternoon delight.
Well, let's hope.

00:24:32,467 --> 00:24:33,768
(chuckles)
Either way,

00:24:33,835 --> 00:24:36,037
their heartbeats went
back to normal

00:24:36,104 --> 00:24:38,707
and they died in their sleep
a few hours later.

00:24:40,408 --> 00:24:42,444
(computer beeping)

00:25:12,273 --> 00:25:15,777
(beeping continues)

00:25:25,553 --> 00:25:29,324
(line ringing)

00:25:29,391 --> 00:25:31,326
Okay, so I've been
thinking this over

00:25:31,393 --> 00:25:35,296
and here's my advice.

00:25:35,363 --> 00:25:36,965
If you want to get a real
relationship with a girl,

00:25:37,032 --> 00:25:38,666
you are going to have
to move out of Mom's.

00:25:39,868 --> 00:25:41,536
No girl wants the competition.

00:25:41,603 --> 00:25:43,838
I'm sorry.

00:25:46,408 --> 00:25:49,310
(beeping)

00:25:57,085 --> 00:25:59,888
(man screaming)

00:26:02,424 --> 00:26:04,959
Oh, God, no, no, turn 'em off.
Turn 'em off. Turn 'em off.

00:26:05,026 --> 00:26:07,662
David Bohr, you're under arrest
for the murder of Wayne Connor.

00:26:07,729 --> 00:26:09,964
No, no, it was self-defense.

00:26:10,031 --> 00:26:12,967
He tried to kill me
over a couple hundred bucks.

00:26:13,034 --> 00:26:14,803
He needed
some stuff.

00:26:14,869 --> 00:26:18,106
He couldn't pay.
He said some money was coming.

00:26:18,173 --> 00:26:19,340
I had to go to work.

00:26:19,407 --> 00:26:21,776
I turned to leave and he comes
at me like an animal.

00:26:21,843 --> 00:26:23,278
I have to go.
No, no, no, no.

00:26:23,344 --> 00:26:26,247
(both grunting)

00:26:32,287 --> 00:26:33,688
This is Captain Brass.

00:26:33,755 --> 00:26:36,691
We need a Code 3 paramedic
response to my location.

00:26:36,758 --> 00:26:38,993
(screaming):
No!

00:28:01,208 --> 00:28:02,000
(door opens)
BROWN:
Thanks, man.

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,001
Hey, I got your page.

00:28:03,067 --> 00:28:04,102
What's up?

00:28:04,169 --> 00:28:05,870
I think our cases
might be connected.

00:28:05,937 --> 00:28:08,873
Take a look at that.

00:28:11,276 --> 00:28:15,380
So my green-blooded victim
from the vacant lot was buying

00:28:15,447 --> 00:28:17,415
pharmaceuticals from the guy
who did pest removal

00:28:17,482 --> 00:28:18,483
for your dead couple.

00:28:20,752 --> 00:28:22,120
Looks like this guy was trying

00:28:22,187 --> 00:28:24,022
to create radio frequencies
or something.

00:28:24,089 --> 00:28:26,124
Well, I don't know
what kind of effect

00:28:26,191 --> 00:28:28,059
that has on
household pests,

00:28:28,126 --> 00:28:30,795
but radio waves can produce
"noise on the channel,"

00:28:30,862 --> 00:28:32,997
which could interfere
with pacemaker function.

00:28:33,064 --> 00:28:34,165
Thing is...

00:28:34,232 --> 00:28:36,367
the Martins' pacemakers
are still ticking.

00:28:38,403 --> 00:28:40,805
Ah, the luck of the Irish.

00:28:40,872 --> 00:28:42,841
It makes sense,
though.

00:28:42,907 --> 00:28:45,176
If his blood was green,
his organs would be green.

00:28:45,243 --> 00:28:47,712
Well, frankly, I expected
something more in the...

00:28:47,779 --> 00:28:49,714
dark avocado,
almost black range.

00:28:49,781 --> 00:28:52,183
Yeah, this is more
artichoke.

00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:53,184
(chuckles)

00:28:53,251 --> 00:28:54,652
You know,
atmospheric sulfur levels

00:28:54,719 --> 00:28:55,920
are on the rise.

00:28:55,987 --> 00:28:58,089
Hundred years, we're all going
to look like spinach.

00:28:58,156 --> 00:28:59,090
(sighs)

00:28:59,157 --> 00:29:00,225
You guys didn't wait for me.

00:29:00,291 --> 00:29:02,227
We're just about
to excise his brain.

00:29:02,293 --> 00:29:04,028
I'll bet you five bucks, Greg,

00:29:04,095 --> 00:29:06,097
that his brain
is not as green as his heart.

00:29:06,164 --> 00:29:08,166
Keep your money
in your pockets, Greg.

00:29:08,233 --> 00:29:10,368
There's a higher
vascular nature

00:29:10,435 --> 00:29:11,703
to the heart
and lungs.

00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:13,171
Only the blood vessels
in the brain

00:29:13,238 --> 00:29:14,205
are going to be green.

00:29:14,272 --> 00:29:15,607
It's a sucker bet
and you know it.

00:29:15,673 --> 00:29:17,575
Well, thanks, Doc.

00:29:17,642 --> 00:29:19,677
So, uh, Dave here did

00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:21,513
some humane
rodent pest removal

00:29:21,579 --> 00:29:24,349
for Desert Palm Hospital,

00:29:24,416 --> 00:29:27,018
which is where he got
his hands on the thiocyte.

00:29:27,085 --> 00:29:28,887
He was all about freedom
from pain.

00:29:36,294 --> 00:29:38,229
Ah.

00:29:38,296 --> 00:29:39,297
Sea foam.

00:29:39,364 --> 00:29:41,399
A lovely shade.

00:29:54,012 --> 00:29:56,748
Look at the size of that.

00:29:56,815 --> 00:30:01,119
He had a brain tumor
pressing on the amygdala.

00:30:01,186 --> 00:30:04,122
Well, this could cause
his migraines.

00:30:04,189 --> 00:30:06,157
Absolutely,

00:30:06,224 --> 00:30:08,760
and also aggressive
disruptive behavior,

00:30:08,827 --> 00:30:10,261
paranoia.

00:30:10,328 --> 00:30:12,764
As the tumor enlarged,
it impacted the arteries,

00:30:12,831 --> 00:30:15,400
causing the cerebral hemorrhage
that you observed.

00:30:15,467 --> 00:30:16,501
(screaming)

00:30:16,568 --> 00:30:18,269
He was self-medicating

00:30:18,336 --> 00:30:19,504
for the wrong condition.

00:30:19,571 --> 00:30:21,139
No wonder he overdosed.

00:30:22,841 --> 00:30:24,275
WILLOWS:
<i>Let 'er rip.</i>

00:30:24,342 --> 00:30:27,212
(whirring)

00:30:29,247 --> 00:30:31,516
In order to interfere
with pacemaker function,

00:30:31,583 --> 00:30:34,953
it'd have to be putting out
between 50 and 60 hertz.

00:30:35,019 --> 00:30:37,522
Okay, I'll input
that range.
(typing)

00:30:44,696 --> 00:30:47,532
This thing isn't putting out
anything that's lethal.

00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:50,268
Tox report showed that
the medications weren't lethal.

00:30:50,335 --> 00:30:51,436
This thing's harmless.

00:30:51,503 --> 00:30:53,638
I refuse to believe
it was natural causes.

00:30:53,705 --> 00:30:55,540
It's too big
of a coincidence.

00:30:55,607 --> 00:30:59,711
So we've got a dead cat
and dead squirrels.

00:30:59,778 --> 00:31:02,514
Maybe what killed them
is what killed the Martins.

00:31:16,094 --> 00:31:18,430
In an interview in the
<i>San Francisco Chronicle--</i>

00:31:18,496 --> 00:31:22,634
October 31, 1996,
if I recall correctly--

00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:25,570
one Professor Gilbert Grissom
revealed that as a boy,

00:31:25,637 --> 00:31:26,971
he collected dead animals

00:31:27,038 --> 00:31:29,007
he found in his Marina
del Rey neighborhood

00:31:29,073 --> 00:31:32,377
and performed necropsies
on them.

00:31:32,444 --> 00:31:34,746
Hodges...

00:31:34,813 --> 00:31:36,881
I want you to stop stalking me.

00:31:37,916 --> 00:31:40,552
(sniffing)

00:31:43,888 --> 00:31:46,891
Bitter almonds.

00:31:55,934 --> 00:31:57,902
Cyanide

00:31:57,969 --> 00:31:59,904
crystals in the
stomach lining.

00:31:59,971 --> 00:32:02,474
Yeah, any time you need
a sniffer to detect it,

00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:04,709
my nose has
the cyanide gene.

00:32:05,743 --> 00:32:09,681
What gene turned
your nose brown?

00:32:09,748 --> 00:32:11,583
Go ahead.
You can sew him up.

00:32:11,649 --> 00:32:13,585
Will do.

00:32:13,651 --> 00:32:15,587
And I'll notify
next of kin, too.

00:32:15,653 --> 00:32:17,155
(chuckles)

00:32:18,156 --> 00:32:19,524
Ugh.

00:32:19,591 --> 00:32:20,859
GRISSOM:
Cyanide is fast-acting.

00:32:20,925 --> 00:32:22,360
If it killed
the squirrels

00:32:22,427 --> 00:32:24,629
before the crystals were
dissolved completely
in their stomachs,

00:32:24,696 --> 00:32:26,965
you'd expect the same thing
with the Martins.

00:32:27,031 --> 00:32:28,566
I saw the Martins'
stomach contents.

00:32:28,633 --> 00:32:29,667
There were no white crystals.

00:32:29,734 --> 00:32:31,202
Yeah, but maybe
if it was ingested

00:32:31,269 --> 00:32:32,537
in a different manner.

00:32:32,604 --> 00:32:33,638
Squirrels will
eat anything.

00:32:33,705 --> 00:32:35,306
If the Martins drank it,

00:32:35,373 --> 00:32:37,342
then that would explain
the absence of crystals.

00:32:37,408 --> 00:32:40,411
I already have Henry running
an expanded tox panel.

00:32:41,546 --> 00:32:44,482
Any minute now.

00:32:44,549 --> 00:32:47,252
It's cooking.

00:32:47,318 --> 00:32:48,420
(beeping)

00:32:48,486 --> 00:32:50,588
It's coming right up.

00:32:50,655 --> 00:32:52,424
Yeah.

00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:54,426
You hear Hodges is looking
for his own apartment?

00:32:54,492 --> 00:32:56,394
Cut the old apron strings.

00:32:56,461 --> 00:32:58,163
His mother finally
kicked him out, huh?

00:32:58,229 --> 00:32:59,364
Good for her.

00:33:03,501 --> 00:33:06,271
Lethal levels of cyanide.

00:33:06,337 --> 00:33:08,573
You can't just walk into a
hardware store and pick some up.

00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,341
What about pest control
companies?

00:33:10,408 --> 00:33:11,509
Can they get it?
Yeah.

00:33:11,576 --> 00:33:14,679
And mining companies,
uh, electroplaters,

00:33:14,746 --> 00:33:16,848
photographers,
jewelry makers.

00:33:16,915 --> 00:33:18,850
Thanks, Henry.

00:33:18,917 --> 00:33:20,952
You can relax now.

00:33:23,888 --> 00:33:25,690
(exhales)

00:33:27,725 --> 00:33:29,828
Look, is this going
to take long?

00:33:29,894 --> 00:33:32,363
Depends on you.

00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:35,366
'Cause I'm dealing
with some really bad news.

00:33:35,433 --> 00:33:38,103
I just found out my ex died
last night.

00:33:38,169 --> 00:33:40,271
I'm sorry.

00:33:40,338 --> 00:33:43,041
Yeah, apparently one of you guys
blew him up with a stun gun.

00:33:43,108 --> 00:33:45,310
Kyle Planck is your ex?

00:33:45,376 --> 00:33:46,811
Tell me, what is it

00:33:46,878 --> 00:33:48,780
that you two have
against God's fur-covered

00:33:48,847 --> 00:33:50,281
creatures?

00:33:50,348 --> 00:33:51,649
Is this about that damn cat?

00:33:51,716 --> 00:33:53,418
For starters, yes.

00:33:55,386 --> 00:33:58,156
Look, I like cats, all right?

00:33:58,223 --> 00:34:00,391
It was an accident.

00:34:00,458 --> 00:34:02,727
You can't just relocate
ground squirrels.

00:34:02,794 --> 00:34:04,062
Okay?

00:34:04,129 --> 00:34:06,231
I mean, they're...
they're disgusting.

00:34:06,297 --> 00:34:07,899
And I'm an artist.

00:34:07,966 --> 00:34:09,501
I need a certain environment

00:34:09,567 --> 00:34:10,769
to work in.

00:34:10,835 --> 00:34:13,371
Does this environment give you
access to cyanide?

00:34:13,438 --> 00:34:16,708
I use potassium cyanide
in electroplating.

00:34:16,775 --> 00:34:17,809
All my work

00:34:17,876 --> 00:34:18,877
is custom.

00:34:18,943 --> 00:34:20,879
And also to poison
ground squirrels?

00:34:20,945 --> 00:34:23,882
I mixed a little
with a can of tuna.

00:34:23,948 --> 00:34:25,884
And I put it out back.

00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:28,219
But only in my yard.

00:34:28,286 --> 00:34:30,422
All right, who knew
the Martins' cat
was going to find it?

00:34:30,488 --> 00:34:32,390
What? Is that against the law?
Actually,

00:34:32,457 --> 00:34:34,726
irresponsible use of poison
<i>is</i> against the law,

00:34:34,793 --> 00:34:36,761
as well as killing
ground squirrels

00:34:36,828 --> 00:34:38,763
and killing
neighbors.

00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:40,765
What?

00:34:40,832 --> 00:34:43,701
I didn't...
I didn't kill them.

00:34:45,069 --> 00:34:47,572
Look, we had neighbor issues.

00:34:49,073 --> 00:34:50,508
Turn that damn thing off

00:34:50,575 --> 00:34:52,243
before I torch it!
You're driving
all your squirrels

00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:53,111
into my yard.

00:34:53,178 --> 00:34:54,245
All right, look,

00:34:54,312 --> 00:34:55,713
we're just trying
to be humane here.

00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:57,515
Now you use poison.

00:34:57,582 --> 00:34:58,583
And you-you killed

00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:00,285
Shrodinger.
You should've kept

00:35:00,351 --> 00:35:01,853
your cat on your side
of the fence, all right.

00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,221
You're causing this problem,
not me.

00:35:03,288 --> 00:35:04,322
Just leave us alone!

00:35:06,157 --> 00:35:09,094
I killed the squirrels.

00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:12,097
And possibly their cat.

00:35:12,163 --> 00:35:14,599
But I am not a murderer.

00:35:18,436 --> 00:35:20,371
(sniffing)

00:35:20,438 --> 00:35:21,639
(exhaling)

00:35:21,706 --> 00:35:23,708
(sniffing)

00:35:25,643 --> 00:35:27,612
(exhaling)

00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:30,415
(sniffing)

00:35:30,482 --> 00:35:31,950
(exhaling)

00:35:33,284 --> 00:35:34,986
I got nothing.

00:35:35,053 --> 00:35:37,055
Try the bed.

00:35:41,593 --> 00:35:43,528
(sniffing)

00:35:43,595 --> 00:35:46,598
(laughs)

00:35:47,632 --> 00:35:50,001
That's...

00:35:50,068 --> 00:35:51,870
Sorry. I was thinking
of one of those, uh,

00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:53,838
bloodhounds in the old

00:35:53,905 --> 00:35:55,173
cartoons,

00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,076
"Sniffing awound
to find da wabbit."

00:35:58,143 --> 00:36:00,078
(imitating
Elmer Fudd laugh)

00:36:00,145 --> 00:36:01,646
This is a gift.

00:36:01,713 --> 00:36:04,416
Don't make it cheap.

00:36:04,482 --> 00:36:06,484
(sniffing)

00:36:08,853 --> 00:36:10,822
Trail's gone cold.

00:36:10,889 --> 00:36:13,858
So, they died in this room.

00:36:13,925 --> 00:36:15,927
In bed.

00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:24,068
Give me a hand
with the mattress.

00:36:40,218 --> 00:36:44,055
Now, get down and sniff the rug.

00:36:46,057 --> 00:36:48,726
It's all they
ever want.

00:36:52,964 --> 00:36:54,899
(sniffing)

00:36:54,966 --> 00:36:56,901
(exhaling)

00:36:56,968 --> 00:36:58,369
Pay dirt.

00:37:04,943 --> 00:37:07,879
This carpet looks
kind of new, right?

00:37:07,946 --> 00:37:10,381
Yeah.

00:37:23,261 --> 00:37:25,897
Definitely
some combustion there.

00:37:31,269 --> 00:37:33,104
It looks like they just
laid the new carpet

00:37:33,171 --> 00:37:34,405
right on top of the old,

00:37:34,472 --> 00:37:36,775
which clearly limited
the supply of oxygen.

00:37:36,841 --> 00:37:39,177
The old carpet melted

00:37:39,244 --> 00:37:41,246
without bursting into flame.

00:37:44,783 --> 00:37:48,219
Ironically, older carpets
contained polyvinyl chloride

00:37:48,286 --> 00:37:50,455
used as a flame retardant.

00:37:50,522 --> 00:37:52,824
So, when it got hot,

00:37:52,891 --> 00:37:56,161
it probably went into
quantitative decomposition,

00:37:56,227 --> 00:37:59,397
<i>which gave off gases,</i>

00:37:59,464 --> 00:38:03,501
<i>including hydrogen cyanide.</i>

00:38:13,244 --> 00:38:15,180
(coughing)

00:38:15,246 --> 00:38:17,449
Field work dirty.

00:38:17,515 --> 00:38:20,518
Dirty, dirty, dirty.

00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:23,121
(knocking wood)

00:38:23,188 --> 00:38:24,456
(pounding wood)

00:38:29,527 --> 00:38:32,530
(dog barking in distance)

00:38:47,445 --> 00:38:50,448
Oh! Come on!

00:38:56,588 --> 00:38:58,223
Your killer's a
ground squirrel?

00:38:58,289 --> 00:39:01,226
In a way,
I'd argue self-defense.

00:39:01,292 --> 00:39:03,294
(gadget humming)

00:39:10,902 --> 00:39:13,905
(squirrel chittering)

00:39:17,475 --> 00:39:19,477
(chittering)

00:39:24,783 --> 00:39:26,751
(buzzing)

00:39:26,818 --> 00:39:27,952
It was an old house.

00:39:28,019 --> 00:39:29,254
The wood had
desiccated.

00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,890
The short circuit smoldered
into the floor joists.

00:39:34,926 --> 00:39:36,928
(buzzing)

00:39:42,066 --> 00:39:44,002
(popping)

00:39:44,068 --> 00:39:46,070
(gases hissing)

00:39:50,742 --> 00:39:52,677
Is it bad
when you start thinking

00:39:52,744 --> 00:39:54,679
none of this sounds
too weird anymore?

00:39:54,746 --> 00:39:56,748
Oh, it's a bit too freaky
how these cases are connected.

00:39:56,815 --> 00:39:58,516
Grissom,
you always say

00:39:58,583 --> 00:39:59,951
that there's no such
thing as coincidence.

00:40:00,018 --> 00:40:01,286
There isn't.

00:40:01,352 --> 00:40:02,754
WILLOWS:
Oh, come on.

00:40:02,821 --> 00:40:03,955
You got the guy that burst

00:40:04,022 --> 00:40:06,391
<i>into flames just divorced</i>
<i>from the woman</i>

00:40:06,458 --> 00:40:09,527
<i>who was fighting squirrel wars</i>
<i>with the Martins.</i>

00:40:09,594 --> 00:40:11,463
SANDERS:
<i>Who had hired the exterminator</i>

00:40:11,529 --> 00:40:12,897
<i>whose drugs were turning</i>
<i>everybody's blood green.</i>

00:40:12,964 --> 00:40:15,533
STOKES:
<i>And one of his green-blooded</i>
<i>customers was Evelyn,</i>

00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,302
<i>Our Lady of Tin Foil,</i>

00:40:17,368 --> 00:40:19,804
<i>the last person that Kyle</i>
<i>Planck touched before he died.</i>

00:40:19,871 --> 00:40:21,806
There's one more connection.

00:40:21,873 --> 00:40:23,541
Evelyn had 200 bucks.

00:40:23,608 --> 00:40:25,210
I'm thinking that
when she was run over,

00:40:25,276 --> 00:40:25,877
<i>she was</i>

00:40:25,944 --> 00:40:27,879
on her way
to buy more thiocyte.

00:40:27,946 --> 00:40:29,147
I think

00:40:29,214 --> 00:40:31,649
that Wayne Connor
was with David Bohr,

00:40:31,716 --> 00:40:33,284
waiting for the money to arrive.

00:40:33,351 --> 00:40:35,120
SANDERS:
<i>Only Evelyn never showed up.</i>

00:40:35,186 --> 00:40:38,056
<i>Connor lost his temper,</i>
<i>and Bohr killed him in a fight.</i>

00:40:38,123 --> 00:40:40,091
And it all started
with Kyle Planck--

00:40:40,158 --> 00:40:42,327
<i>lonely guy with a gut</i>
<i>full of moonshine.</i>

00:40:42,393 --> 00:40:45,063
String theory.

00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:46,965
Grissom theory.

00:40:47,031 --> 00:40:48,900
This is better
than a bedtime story.

00:40:48,967 --> 00:40:51,569
GRISSOM:
String theory is
"the theory of everything."

00:40:51,636 --> 00:40:54,606
Quantum mechanics tells us
about the very small.

00:40:54,672 --> 00:40:56,875
The theory of relativity
explains

00:40:56,941 --> 00:40:58,042
the immense.

00:40:58,109 --> 00:40:59,711
String theory ties it
all together.

00:40:59,778 --> 00:41:02,113
It proposes
that atomic particles

00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:06,050
are made up of infinitesimal,
vibrating loops of energy--

00:41:06,117 --> 00:41:07,385
or strings.

00:41:07,452 --> 00:41:10,822
Each string vibrates
at its own frequency--

00:41:10,889 --> 00:41:13,825
like on a violin,
producing "notes."

00:41:13,892 --> 00:41:17,629
And these notes make up
everything in the universe.

00:41:17,695 --> 00:41:19,564
Cosmic symphony.

00:41:19,631 --> 00:41:22,901
These strings have been
combining and recombining

00:41:22,967 --> 00:41:24,903
ever since the big bang.

00:41:24,969 --> 00:41:28,239
So, the connections
between our victims--

00:41:28,306 --> 00:41:30,241
or any of us--

00:41:30,308 --> 00:41:32,277
are not that extraordinary.

00:41:32,343 --> 00:41:35,413
But every one of them
thought they were alone.

00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:38,316
BROWN:
Too bad they didn't know
about Grissom's theory.

00:41:38,383 --> 00:41:39,751
In a parallel universe,

00:41:39,818 --> 00:41:41,286
maybe they're all having
breakfast together.

00:41:41,352 --> 00:41:42,687
In this universe,

00:41:42,754 --> 00:41:44,355
maybe we are.

00:41:44,422 --> 00:41:45,490
STOKES:
Yeah.

00:41:45,557 --> 00:41:46,891
And you're buying.

00:41:47,926 --> 00:41:50,495
No strings attached.
