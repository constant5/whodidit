00:12:34,578 --> 00:12:36,113

00:12:38,115 --> 00:12:39,883
the freezer
looked just like this.

00:12:41,852 --> 00:12:43,487
It's a great way to lure a kid.

00:12:43,487 --> 00:12:46,523

more like a...

You know, it depends--
you know, you walk

00:13:05,909 --> 00:13:07,377

the victim, suspect.

00:13:07,377 --> 00:13:09,613

00:13:19,857 --> 00:13:21,325
He was in their house,

00:13:21,325 --> 00:13:23,127
he... was holding

00:13:23,127 --> 00:13:25,028
the little girl's nightgown,
he watched her

00:13:25,028 --> 00:13:27,064
for years.
Yeah, exactly.

00:13:27,064 --> 00:13:28,565
For years. Thank you, yeah.

00:13:28,565 --> 00:13:31,068
And all of a sudden one night
he stops watching

00:13:31,068 --> 00:13:32,503
and he starts killing?

00:13:32,503 --> 00:13:35,105
Why?

00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:36,540
(gulps, shivers)

00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,175
WILLOWS:
Right hand.

00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:41,145
Is it gonna hurt?

00:13:41,145 --> 00:13:43,180
A lot less than
jabbing a towel bar

00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,848
into a woman 20 times.

00:13:44,848 --> 00:13:46,416
I didn't do it.

00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:48,318
Any of it.

00:13:48,318 --> 00:13:50,287
I went by the house.

00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:52,289
I looked in
and I saw her.

00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:53,924
She was already dead.

00:13:53,924 --> 00:13:56,560
The blood.

00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,928
(cap snaps on)

00:13:57,928 --> 00:13:59,363
I loved her.

00:13:59,363 --> 00:14:01,999
I couldn't leave her
there like that.

00:14:01,999 --> 00:14:03,500
Other hand.
BRASS:
You know,

00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,836
I ran you-- you had no
record, no complaints.

00:14:05,836 --> 00:14:07,604
But here's what
I think happened.

00:14:07,604 --> 00:14:09,306
I think you were hanging out

00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:11,875
by that window peeping,
and someone saw you,

00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:14,511
told the Chamblisses--
Dad didn't like that.

00:14:14,511 --> 00:14:17,915
So he walked across the
street to your house,

00:14:17,915 --> 00:14:20,851
knocked on your door,
then knocked on your head.

00:14:20,851 --> 00:14:23,554
And you didn't
like that.
I tested your hands

00:14:23,554 --> 00:14:25,989
for lead to determine
if you fired a gun.

00:14:25,989 --> 00:14:28,926
And guess what
color positive is?

00:14:30,961 --> 00:14:33,397
WILLOWS:
You shot that
little girl.

00:14:33,397 --> 00:14:37,034
You shot her father,
sliced and diced
her grandmother,

00:14:37,034 --> 00:14:39,369
and stabbed and beat her
mother with a towel bar.

00:14:39,369 --> 00:14:41,271
BRASS:
And we're gonna
prove it, too.

00:14:41,271 --> 00:14:44,374
So you got a choice-- you can
spend the rest of your life

00:14:44,374 --> 00:14:47,044
in general pop with a bunch
of gangsters and killers

00:14:47,044 --> 00:14:48,846
who never get to
see their kids,

00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:51,114
they're gonna take it out
on you in a heavy way,

00:14:51,114 --> 00:14:52,583
<i>or</i> you can tell us

00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:54,618
what you did...

00:14:54,618 --> 00:14:57,955
and maybe buy yourself a private
cell-- what's it gonna be?

00:14:57,955 --> 00:14:59,122
I did it.

00:15:02,326 --> 00:15:05,329
I'm the one who killed
the Chambliss family.

00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:07,965
(reporters clamoring)

00:15:07,965 --> 00:15:09,533
Good afternoon.

00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:11,001
I'm Undersheriff Ecklie

00:15:11,001 --> 00:15:13,303
of the Los Vegas
Police Department.

00:15:13,303 --> 00:15:15,205
I'm here to announce that,

00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:18,275
thanks to the fine efforts
of our detectives and CSI's,

00:15:18,275 --> 00:15:19,943
we have a suspect in custody

00:15:19,943 --> 00:15:22,913
who has confessed to the murders
of the Chambliss family.

00:15:22,913 --> 00:15:25,849
Can you tell us his name?
Why did he do it?
How did he it?

00:15:25,849 --> 00:15:27,551
I have no further comment
at this time.

00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:29,486
Why can't you tell us?
One last question.

00:15:29,486 --> 00:15:31,622
Hey, thanks.
Nice job.

00:15:31,622 --> 00:15:33,123
Good work, sir.
(chuckles):
Yeah.

00:15:35,158 --> 00:15:37,427
WOMAN:
I am saying there
has been a mistake.

00:15:37,427 --> 00:15:39,229
I saw the news--
that sheriff...

00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:41,164
OFFICER: Ma'am,
slow... down.

00:15:41,164 --> 00:15:43,100
WOMAN: Don't
patronize me.

00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,268
I have
information about

00:15:44,268 --> 00:15:45,535
the Chambliss murders.

00:15:45,535 --> 00:15:47,170
I need to talk
to somebody in charge.

00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:49,139
OFFICER: That would
be Captain Brass.
You arrested

00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:51,608
the wrong man!
WILLOWS:
Really?

00:15:51,608 --> 00:15:52,943
And you would
know that how?

00:15:54,378 --> 00:15:56,179
I know because I did it.

00:15:58,181 --> 00:16:01,151
I'm the one who killed
the Chambliss family.

00:16:15,966 --> 00:16:17,134
BRASS:
So...

00:16:17,134 --> 00:16:18,268
Leslie, uh...

00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:19,569
Gitig.

00:16:19,569 --> 00:16:21,338
Leslie Gitig.

00:16:21,338 --> 00:16:22,906
G-I-T-I-G.

00:16:22,906 --> 00:16:25,108
People always
get it wrong.
Well,

00:16:25,108 --> 00:16:27,911
we're gonna get
everything right today, Leslie.

00:16:27,911 --> 00:16:29,279
How do you know

00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,914
the Chambliss family?

00:16:30,914 --> 00:16:34,084
Calvin Chambliss and I
were having an affair.

00:16:34,084 --> 00:16:36,153
He promised he'd leave
his wife Susan

00:16:36,153 --> 00:16:37,921
for me.

00:16:37,921 --> 00:16:39,056
I guess that didn't work out.

00:16:39,056 --> 00:16:40,123
He caved.

00:16:40,123 --> 00:16:42,059
He told Susan about me.

00:16:42,059 --> 00:16:43,894
(laughs softly)
Bitch.

00:16:43,894 --> 00:16:45,996
And then he
stopped calling.

00:16:45,996 --> 00:16:48,165
You can check
my phone records.

00:16:48,165 --> 00:16:50,834
Oh, we're gonna do that.
ECKLIE:
So, where were you

00:16:50,834 --> 00:16:53,603
last night between
9:00 and midnight?
Where I always am--

00:16:53,603 --> 00:16:55,105
parked outside their house.

00:16:55,105 --> 00:16:57,908
You can check the
traffic cameras.

00:16:57,908 --> 00:17:01,011
Oh, and I stopped for gas.

00:17:01,011 --> 00:17:02,913
So you got out
of your car?
Yes.

00:17:02,913 --> 00:17:05,015
Then what?
I rang the doorbell.

00:17:05,015 --> 00:17:06,316
Cal's mother, Anita,
answered the door.

00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:08,518
I told her I was
there to see Cal.

00:17:08,518 --> 00:17:10,921
She wouldn't let me
in, so I killed her.

00:17:10,921 --> 00:17:13,557
And then I
killed Cal...

00:17:13,557 --> 00:17:15,225
and Susan...

00:17:15,225 --> 00:17:16,360
and Fiona.

00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,295
ECKLIE: Yeah,
I read the paper, too.

00:17:18,295 --> 00:17:20,897
Tell us something the whole
world doesn't know, Ms. Guy-tig.

00:17:20,897 --> 00:17:22,399
Gitig.

00:17:25,936 --> 00:17:28,972
You mean like Anita's
throat was slashed.

00:17:28,972 --> 00:17:30,607
(Anita gasping)

00:17:30,607 --> 00:17:32,876
<i>Cal was shot</i>
<i>twice in the chest,</i>

00:17:32,876 --> 00:17:34,978
<i>once between the eyes.</i>

00:17:34,978 --> 00:17:37,080
And Susan

00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,982
was stabbed repeatedly.

00:17:38,982 --> 00:17:39,916
(crying)

00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:44,087
Oh, and little Fiona...

00:17:44,087 --> 00:17:45,088
(Fiona screams)

00:17:45,088 --> 00:17:47,491
...was shot in the head.

00:17:50,427 --> 00:17:52,963
So, you said you entered the
house through the front door?

00:17:52,963 --> 00:17:54,498
If you want to videotape this,

00:17:54,498 --> 00:17:56,133
I can start again
from the beginning.

00:17:59,403 --> 00:18:01,938
(door opens)

00:18:01,938 --> 00:18:03,206
(door closes)

00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:07,411
I heard about
the second confession.

00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:11,448
One is good; two is bad.

00:18:11,448 --> 00:18:13,150
Nut job or not,

00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:15,152
she's just made things a
lot more difficult for us,

00:18:15,152 --> 00:18:16,453
creating reasonable doubt.

00:18:16,453 --> 00:18:18,855
(sighs):
So...

00:18:18,855 --> 00:18:20,557
where would you
like to start?

00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:21,992
Let's start with Mom.

00:18:24,528 --> 00:18:26,296
Susan Chambliss.

00:18:26,296 --> 00:18:27,998
Massive head trauma.

00:18:27,998 --> 00:18:29,599
Exsanguination.

00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:32,369
24 sharp-force injuries
consistent with

00:18:32,369 --> 00:18:34,504
the jagged ends
of the towel bar.

00:18:34,504 --> 00:18:36,973
15 accompanying

00:18:36,973 --> 00:18:40,077
blunt-force injuries
consistent with its
rounded sides.

00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,846
Beaten and stabbed to death.

00:18:42,846 --> 00:18:45,015
39 blows.

00:18:45,015 --> 00:18:47,851
Towel bar ripped
from the wall.

00:18:47,851 --> 00:18:49,986
Rage.
Yeah.

00:18:49,986 --> 00:18:52,055
Dear old Dad's
a different story.

00:18:52,055 --> 00:18:53,590
Two gunshot wounds

00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,392
to the chest,
and a coup de grâce.

00:18:55,392 --> 00:18:58,361
David found these blue fibers
on Dad's clothing.

00:18:58,361 --> 00:19:01,364
Could be the shooter.

00:19:01,364 --> 00:19:03,333
Contact wound right through
the frontal bone,

00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:05,202
execution style.

00:19:05,202 --> 00:19:07,070
Clean and quick.

00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:09,106
Rounds look like
nine-mill.

00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:11,007
Same as little girl.

00:19:13,143 --> 00:19:14,945
I'm not sure I want
to hear this, but...

00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:16,947
sexual assault?

00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,415
There was nothing.

00:19:18,415 --> 00:19:20,016
No physical findings

00:19:20,016 --> 00:19:22,319
of any sexual abuse.

00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:24,921
He escalates to murder
but leaves the object

00:19:24,921 --> 00:19:27,057
of his perversion untouched?

00:19:27,057 --> 00:19:28,325
Then he just kills her?

00:19:28,325 --> 00:19:30,393
Doesn't make sense.

00:19:31,995 --> 00:19:33,497
RUSSELL:
Hey.

00:19:33,497 --> 00:19:35,132
Good first day?

00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:36,566
Yeah.

00:19:36,566 --> 00:19:38,001
Finished processing
outside, and I'm

00:19:38,001 --> 00:19:39,136
starting on the blood inside.

00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:40,403
Great, great.
Walk with me.

00:19:40,403 --> 00:19:41,605
Family meeting.

00:19:41,605 --> 00:19:43,006
Everybody. Let's go.

00:19:44,407 --> 00:19:46,009
Is he for real?

00:19:50,213 --> 00:19:52,482
Hey, looks good, Greg.

00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:54,518
Okay.

00:19:54,518 --> 00:19:56,119
So, this is

00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:57,888
how I like to run
a family meeting.

00:19:57,888 --> 00:19:59,489
Clarify the problem
first, okay?

00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:02,092
And we have two competing
stories in this case.

00:20:02,092 --> 00:20:05,896
Who thinks that, uh, the
target of this attack
was the little girl?

00:20:05,896 --> 00:20:07,531
Raise your hands.

00:20:07,531 --> 00:20:08,999
Okay.

00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,400
Never mind.
Point of entry.

00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,968
The window?

00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:15,038
All right, okay,
all right.

00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:17,040
Here comes the birdbath. Smash!

00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,575
What's the
little girl do?

00:20:18,575 --> 00:20:21,111
I, uh, found a puddle
of urine under the bed.

00:20:21,111 --> 00:20:23,046
She must have hid there.
All right.

00:20:23,046 --> 00:20:25,115
Nick, you processed the dad.

00:20:25,115 --> 00:20:26,616
Could he have
heard all of this?

00:20:26,616 --> 00:20:28,151
Evidence tells me no.

00:20:28,151 --> 00:20:30,453
He barely got off the sofa
before he was shot.

00:20:30,453 --> 00:20:32,155
TV was on-- he might
have been asleep.

00:20:32,155 --> 00:20:34,224
And Grandma wears a hearing aid,

00:20:34,224 --> 00:20:35,926
so she probably
didn't hear anything.

00:20:35,926 --> 00:20:38,061
SANDERS:
Flour on the kitchen floor
indicates Mom was

00:20:38,061 --> 00:20:39,896
baking a cake.

00:20:39,896 --> 00:20:42,165
Mixer's on.
That's pretty loud.
Okay,

00:20:42,165 --> 00:20:43,934
so maybe nobody hears
the window break.

00:20:43,934 --> 00:20:45,835
But that's crazy.

00:20:45,835 --> 00:20:48,004
You know, if someone breaks in
to my daughter's bedroom,

00:20:48,004 --> 00:20:50,106
first she yells
bloody hell, then
she wouldn't hide,

00:20:50,106 --> 00:20:52,609
she'd run to me.
Little girl's
behavior is off.

00:20:52,609 --> 00:20:54,444
Everybody's behavior's
off on this thing.

00:20:54,444 --> 00:20:57,113
Oh, by the way,
Catherine called and said

00:20:57,113 --> 00:20:59,583
John Lee did not touch
the girl sexually.

00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:02,052
So I'm glad to see
none of you raised
your hands when I asked

00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:03,954
if she was the source
of this whole thing.

00:21:03,954 --> 00:21:06,256
In that case,
I'd like to retract

00:21:06,256 --> 00:21:08,158
my hand-raise from earlier.

00:21:08,158 --> 00:21:09,459
Girl's behavior
is more consistent

00:21:09,459 --> 00:21:11,528
with point of entry
at the front door.

00:21:11,528 --> 00:21:13,396
Then she ran and hid.

00:21:13,396 --> 00:21:15,966
But there was no evidence of
forced entry at the front door.

00:21:15,966 --> 00:21:17,300
Dad's on the sofa,

00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:20,337
Mom's in the kitchen...

00:21:20,337 --> 00:21:22,906
and Grandma had to let them in.

00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:24,307
STOKES:
Grandma was first,

00:21:24,307 --> 00:21:26,042
Dad was second, Mom was third,

00:21:26,042 --> 00:21:27,877
stabbed and then dragged
into the bathroom.

00:21:27,877 --> 00:21:29,546
Fiona was last.

00:21:29,546 --> 00:21:31,915
But if John Lee
didn't assault her...

00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:34,017
Why did he kill her?
Well, maybe he
didn't, now.

00:21:34,017 --> 00:21:35,952
Maybe he came in
<i>after</i> the killings.

00:21:35,952 --> 00:21:38,555
He breaks in, throws the
birdbath through the window,

00:21:38,555 --> 00:21:40,590
and then, like he says,
he changes her clothes.

00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,158
It would explain
why we haven't found

00:21:42,158 --> 00:21:43,193
any bloody clothes, or a gun,

00:21:43,193 --> 00:21:44,461
or a knife
at his house.

00:21:44,461 --> 00:21:46,863
Somebody else
killed this family.

00:21:46,863 --> 00:21:48,265
GITIG:
<i>I wore gloves.</i>

00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:50,333
I always keep a pair in my car.

00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:51,901
Disposable.

00:21:51,901 --> 00:21:54,437
BRASS:
Disposable?

00:21:54,437 --> 00:21:56,473
Where'd you dispose
of the gun,

00:21:56,473 --> 00:21:58,608
the knife,
the clothes you wore?

00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:00,143
I threw them away.

00:22:00,143 --> 00:22:01,511
Where?

00:22:01,511 --> 00:22:03,346
(clears throat)

00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:08,418
I disposed of my Beretta

00:22:08,418 --> 00:22:10,287
in the water hazard
off the 12th hole

00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:13,290
at the Alsted
Country Club.

00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,859
I drive by there every day
on my way to the firm.

00:22:15,859 --> 00:22:18,228
I find it peaceful.

00:22:22,399 --> 00:22:24,401
Ooh. Is that it?

00:22:24,401 --> 00:22:26,136
Just like she said.

00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:27,437
12th hole
water hazard.

00:22:27,437 --> 00:22:29,839
Swan took a bite
out of the diver.

00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:32,375
I'm surprised you let
someone else go in after it.

00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:34,277
You know how those
Navy Seals are.

00:22:34,277 --> 00:22:36,579
They make us Marines
take a back seat.

00:22:36,579 --> 00:22:38,281
Yeah. Well, bullets
are in evidence.

00:22:38,281 --> 00:22:40,917
When you're done, make sure
Russell gets your report?

00:22:40,917 --> 00:22:42,085
Got it.

00:22:42,085 --> 00:22:43,353
Best job in the world.

00:22:43,353 --> 00:22:45,355
Get to play with guns.

00:22:45,355 --> 00:22:48,091
Nobody's shooting back.

00:22:48,091 --> 00:22:49,826
SANDERS:
Print of John Lee's boot.

00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:51,328
Here you go.

00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:53,263
Great.

00:22:56,499 --> 00:23:00,103
Individual characteristics
line up.

00:23:00,103 --> 00:23:01,938
Boots match.

00:23:01,938 --> 00:23:04,107
Got him at the window.

00:23:11,448 --> 00:23:13,350
But not in the house.

00:23:14,984 --> 00:23:17,487
He gained two sizes coming in.

00:23:17,487 --> 00:23:19,189
Russell was right.

00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:21,458
Nice hand retraction...

00:23:21,458 --> 00:23:23,326
brown nose.

00:23:23,326 --> 00:23:26,229
♪ ♪

00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:34,337
Fire in the hole.

00:23:45,415 --> 00:23:46,383
(beeping)

00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:04,234
(door opens)

00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:07,971
Where are the other gentlemen?

00:24:07,971 --> 00:24:09,906
(sighs)

00:24:11,541 --> 00:24:13,276
If you're going to ask
me the questions now,

00:24:13,276 --> 00:24:14,978
that red light isn't on.

00:24:14,978 --> 00:24:18,214
You know what
a ballistics match is, right?

00:24:18,214 --> 00:24:19,516
Yes.

00:24:19,516 --> 00:24:22,185
Well, the gun
you had us fish out

00:24:22,185 --> 00:24:24,954
at the country club
was not the murder weapon.

00:24:24,954 --> 00:24:26,556
The caliber was the same,

00:24:26,556 --> 00:24:28,591
but the rifling
wasn't even close.

00:24:28,591 --> 00:24:32,162
Wow. As I understand it,

00:24:32,162 --> 00:24:36,466
any number of things can change
a gun's rifling characteristics.

00:24:36,466 --> 00:24:39,369
Like shoving a screwdriver
down the barrel.

00:24:41,504 --> 00:24:43,306
Are you going back to the lake?

00:24:43,306 --> 00:24:44,841
Obviously,
you found the wrong gun.

00:24:44,841 --> 00:24:46,075
You...

00:24:46,075 --> 00:24:49,512
are a...legal secretary, right?

00:24:49,512 --> 00:24:52,482
You seem like you'd be
really good at that job.

00:24:52,482 --> 00:24:54,083
I mean, you know
criminal procedure,

00:24:54,083 --> 00:24:55,485
you got the lingo down.

00:24:55,485 --> 00:24:58,254
I bet you even
have contacts at PD,

00:24:58,254 --> 00:25:01,057
or maybe
the coroner's office,

00:25:01,057 --> 00:25:02,859
or the crime lab.

00:25:02,859 --> 00:25:05,128
I killed that family.

00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:07,530
Do you want to know why
I did it?

00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:09,599
'Cause that bitch

00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:11,868
got in the way of me and Cal.

00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:16,940
Which is why
I sunk that knife into her

00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:19,209
24 times.

00:25:22,212 --> 00:25:23,379
I'm sorry.

00:25:23,379 --> 00:25:24,447
I completely forgot.

00:25:24,447 --> 00:25:27,217
Um... be right back.

00:25:27,217 --> 00:25:29,352
Don't-Don't go anywhere, though.

00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:34,591
Oh, brother,
she's a piece of work.

00:25:34,591 --> 00:25:36,860
And she's, what, like,
105 pounds soaking wet?

00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,995
And I don't think
she owns work boots.

00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:40,930
Not men's size 12, anyway.

00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:43,833
It was a towel rod,
not a knife.
I ran her phone logs.

00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:45,101
She's been making calls

00:25:45,101 --> 00:25:46,903
to law enforcement
all over the county.

00:25:46,903 --> 00:25:48,371
She got a look
at our evidence.

00:25:48,371 --> 00:25:50,573
You know, she
may be crazy,

00:25:50,573 --> 00:25:52,876
but she figured out
point-of-entry before we did.

00:25:52,876 --> 00:25:54,544
Maybe we should keep that
to ourselves.
Yeah.

00:25:54,544 --> 00:25:56,279
John Lee dressed yet?

00:25:56,279 --> 00:25:58,181
I would hope so. Why?
Guy's a peeper.

00:25:58,181 --> 00:26:00,250
And if he didn't murder
that family,

00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:02,952
maybe he saw who did.

00:26:08,958 --> 00:26:10,994
So, John,

00:26:10,994 --> 00:26:12,996
we know you were
in the house that night,

00:26:12,996 --> 00:26:14,497
in Fiona's room.

00:26:14,497 --> 00:26:16,599
Now you said that...
that she was already dead.

00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:19,435
Let's say we believe
your first version.

00:26:19,435 --> 00:26:21,170
You were still there.

00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:23,273
WILLOWS:
Did you see anything?

00:26:23,273 --> 00:26:24,841
No.
RUSSELL:
Oh.

00:26:24,841 --> 00:26:26,409
Well, maybe not the
night of the murders,

00:26:26,409 --> 00:26:27,977
but come on, buddy.

00:26:27,977 --> 00:26:29,846
You've been watching
that family for years.

00:26:29,846 --> 00:26:31,881
You trying to trick me?

00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:33,516
No. No, no, no, no.
John,

00:26:33,516 --> 00:26:36,152
you loved Fiona.

00:26:36,152 --> 00:26:38,154
Loved her.

00:26:38,154 --> 00:26:39,622
And something horrible
happened to her.

00:26:39,622 --> 00:26:41,124
She would want you to help us.

00:26:49,499 --> 00:26:51,868
Have you ever
seen this woman?

00:26:53,169 --> 00:26:55,004
Red BMW.

00:26:55,004 --> 00:26:57,173
Three Series.

00:26:57,173 --> 00:26:59,142
She would park down the street
and just sit there.

00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:03,313
She's an awful woman.

00:27:03,313 --> 00:27:04,847
How do you know?

00:27:04,847 --> 00:27:06,883
You can just tell sometimes.

00:27:06,883 --> 00:27:08,618
RUSSELL:
Did this

00:27:08,618 --> 00:27:10,420
awful woman ever go inside?

00:27:16,125 --> 00:27:18,861
Did you ever see any other
awful people go inside?

00:27:20,229 --> 00:27:23,399
Can I have that cherry cola now?

00:27:28,171 --> 00:27:30,206
Explain this to me.

00:27:30,206 --> 00:27:32,508
Some perv stalks your daughter,

00:27:32,508 --> 00:27:35,912
peeks in her window,
takes photos for years.

00:27:35,912 --> 00:27:38,514
Mother doesn't work;
father is unemployed.

00:27:38,514 --> 00:27:40,216
I mean, they
were around.

00:27:40,216 --> 00:27:41,918
You can't tell me
they didn't know.

00:27:41,918 --> 00:27:44,520
I found dozens of footprints
outside that window.

00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,290
So why didn't
they call the police?

00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,491
Maybe they couldn't.

00:27:50,093 --> 00:27:51,561
Did you get a look
inside that garage?

00:27:51,561 --> 00:27:54,030
Porsche still has dealer plates,
new Volvo wagon.

00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:55,365
Money.

00:27:55,365 --> 00:27:56,899
Dad was laid off.

00:27:56,899 --> 00:27:58,468
Where'd it come from?

00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:02,171
In L.A., at least 70% of all
murders are related to drugs.

00:28:02,171 --> 00:28:04,574
Well, that might explain what
I recovered from the kitchen.

00:28:04,574 --> 00:28:06,042
Finally got

00:28:06,042 --> 00:28:08,544
a chance to process everything.

00:28:08,544 --> 00:28:11,180
I don't think
Mom was just baking cakes.

00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:13,216
That is a lot of baking soda.

00:28:13,216 --> 00:28:17,920
And one seriously
accurate scale.

00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,023
MORGAN:
Either mom was OCD, or

00:28:20,023 --> 00:28:22,125
she was cutting powder.
Cocaine?

00:28:22,125 --> 00:28:23,559
Maybe meth.

00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:25,194
Well, we didn't find
any drugs in that house.

00:28:25,194 --> 00:28:26,562
Because we weren't looking
for them.

00:28:28,031 --> 00:28:29,532
I'll drive.

00:28:29,532 --> 00:28:31,000
I know the way.

00:28:36,239 --> 00:28:38,307
STOKES:
What are you doing?

00:28:38,307 --> 00:28:41,844
(gasps) My hand looks
like Gorbachev's head.

00:28:41,844 --> 00:28:44,347
I was out in the field whacking
the weeds for weaponry...

00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:46,849
You know better than to handle
evidence without gloves.

00:28:46,849 --> 00:28:48,084
...when I dropped my gloves.

00:28:48,084 --> 00:28:50,319
And when I went down
to pick them up,

00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:52,588
I put my hand in some very
un-eco-friendly battery acid.

00:28:52,588 --> 00:28:54,123
Why'd you drop your gloves?

00:28:54,123 --> 00:28:55,591
You know, they really

00:28:55,591 --> 00:28:57,560
shouldn't even let you out
of the lab.

00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,929
May I cite you
in my Workmen's Comp case?

00:28:59,929 --> 00:29:01,998
How about citing your results
from the blue fibers

00:29:01,998 --> 00:29:04,267
Super Dave found
on Mr. Chambliss, instead?

00:29:04,267 --> 00:29:06,569
Lucky for you, I can
work through the pain.

00:29:08,838 --> 00:29:11,874
Your blue fibers-- denim.

00:29:11,874 --> 00:29:13,843
Of the phylum Levis.

00:29:13,843 --> 00:29:15,445
So jeans.
Almost.

00:29:15,445 --> 00:29:17,847
Just as you'll
never get the chance

00:29:17,847 --> 00:29:21,217
to run Grave, these never
got the chance to be pants.

00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:23,419
How much pain do you want
to have to work through, Hodges?

00:29:23,419 --> 00:29:25,121
Please turn to page two.

00:29:26,989 --> 00:29:30,927
The fibers were saturated
in borate-- fire retardant.

00:29:30,927 --> 00:29:33,496
Jean companies will pulp
their cutting-room scraps

00:29:33,496 --> 00:29:35,465
and sell them
for insulating materials.

00:29:35,465 --> 00:29:37,567
Which is used
in green construction.

00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:39,469
So how does insulation
end up on Dad?

00:29:39,469 --> 00:29:41,604
Well, maybe he was doing
some sort of home improvement?

00:29:41,604 --> 00:29:44,040
Or maybe
the killer works construction.

00:29:46,309 --> 00:29:48,277
You don't have
to be mean about it.

00:30:02,125 --> 00:30:04,894
SIDLE:
Morgan, Greg,
get in here.

00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:11,868
This is the exact layout
of John Lee's bedroom,

00:30:11,868 --> 00:30:13,536
except he didn't
have one of these.

00:30:13,536 --> 00:30:15,538
Yeah, and the electrical
panel's in the garage.

00:30:24,914 --> 00:30:26,883
Good call, Hollywood.

00:30:26,883 --> 00:30:28,451
I love it when I'm right.

00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:31,220
RUSSELL:
<i>We searched the house, John.</i>

00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,421
We know about the drugs.

00:30:32,421 --> 00:30:34,123
So these awful people
that went

00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:36,425
into the house--
is-is that what they came for?

00:30:36,425 --> 00:30:39,495
They let strange men sit
on her bed.

00:30:39,495 --> 00:30:41,931
Made her sit out
in the hallway.

00:30:41,931 --> 00:30:45,134
One time, she
forgot her doll.

00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:47,136
Tried to come
back in and get it.

00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:50,006
Her dad yelled at her.

00:30:50,006 --> 00:30:51,040
She cried.

00:30:53,609 --> 00:30:55,411
He yelled a lot.

00:30:55,411 --> 00:30:57,013
Did he ever yell
at anybody else?

00:31:16,999 --> 00:31:18,935
(computer trilling)

00:31:20,603 --> 00:31:24,140
Got a hit-- multiple arrests
for drug possession.

00:31:25,308 --> 00:31:27,343
SIDLE:
"Lonny Gallows."

00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:29,979
John, you saw something happen
in that house.

00:31:29,979 --> 00:31:32,849
You saw someone arguing
with Fiona's dad.

00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:35,051
Who?

00:31:35,051 --> 00:31:36,886
(phone chirps)

00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:43,526
John, is this the guy?

00:31:45,394 --> 00:31:47,463
Hey! Did you ever

00:31:47,463 --> 00:31:49,298
see this man, John?

00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:53,903
Yes.

00:31:53,903 --> 00:31:55,838
In Fiona's bedroom?

00:31:55,838 --> 00:31:57,573
Yes.

00:31:59,342 --> 00:32:01,177
Yes, a lot.

00:32:04,046 --> 00:32:05,581
Lonny Gallows?!

00:32:06,849 --> 00:32:08,017
(tires screech)

00:32:12,088 --> 00:32:14,056
(grunts)
Get out of here.

00:32:14,056 --> 00:32:16,859
Where you going,
dude?
Yo, I didn't
do nothing!

00:32:16,859 --> 00:32:18,227
Yeah, pat him
down good, Mitch.

00:32:19,996 --> 00:32:22,164
(Lonny sighs)
Lonny,

00:32:22,164 --> 00:32:24,033
this looks bad.

00:32:24,033 --> 00:32:26,235
Yeah, this looks worse.

00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:28,271
Lonny Gallows,
you're under arrest.

00:32:28,271 --> 00:32:31,040
Possession for sales
of a controlled substance.

00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,609
Well, you're in a lot
more trouble than that, bud.

00:32:33,609 --> 00:32:36,112
Hey, what are you doing
with my son?

00:32:36,112 --> 00:32:37,179
Arresting him for murder.

00:32:37,179 --> 00:32:39,315
My son didn't kill anyone.

00:32:39,315 --> 00:32:41,183
Sir, stay out of this now.
You don't want to interfere

00:32:41,183 --> 00:32:44,086
with a police
investigation.

00:32:44,086 --> 00:32:46,088
Those boots are mine.

00:32:46,088 --> 00:32:48,858
So are the gloves.

00:32:48,858 --> 00:32:51,394
Arrest me. I did it.

00:32:51,394 --> 00:32:53,462
I'm the one who killed
the Chambliss family.

00:32:53,462 --> 00:32:54,830
You got to be kidding me.

00:33:03,372 --> 00:33:05,841
You understand lying to
a police officer is a crime.

00:33:05,841 --> 00:33:08,077
I'm not lying.
Really?

00:33:08,077 --> 00:33:09,545
I got your file.

00:33:09,545 --> 00:33:11,547
You know, Mr. Gallows,
you've never done

00:33:11,547 --> 00:33:13,883
anything wrong
in your life.

00:33:13,883 --> 00:33:15,584
You're a family man,
you own your own business,

00:33:15,584 --> 00:33:17,353
you're doing well.

00:33:17,353 --> 00:33:18,921
You're the only guy
in construction that I know

00:33:18,921 --> 00:33:19,956
who's making money.

00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:21,424
Then you massacre
a family?

00:33:21,424 --> 00:33:23,392
I want to make a deal.

00:33:23,392 --> 00:33:25,394
I'm not making a deal with you
because I don't believe you.

00:33:25,394 --> 00:33:28,130
I did it.
Listen, listen, we know
your son's a drug addict.

00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:30,066
He was high
when we busted him

00:33:30,066 --> 00:33:31,600
and it's pretty safe
to assume he was high

00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,402
a couple of nights ago when
he committed these crimes.

00:33:33,402 --> 00:33:35,504
We found his prints all
over the cash and drugs

00:33:35,504 --> 00:33:37,473
in the Chambliss house.
That's how we know

00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:39,575
he was running drugs
for Cal Chambliss.

00:33:39,575 --> 00:33:40,843
I get it--

00:33:40,843 --> 00:33:42,278
you want to protect your kid.

00:33:42,278 --> 00:33:44,080
I did protect my kid
by killing that family.

00:33:46,248 --> 00:33:48,884
Lonny got clean in rehab.

00:33:48,884 --> 00:33:50,453
I tried to keep him clean,
I put him on my crew

00:33:50,453 --> 00:33:52,254
building
green houses--

00:33:52,254 --> 00:33:54,023
same damn houses
in Cal Chambliss' neighborhood.

00:33:54,023 --> 00:33:55,057
So that's

00:33:55,057 --> 00:33:56,192
how they met.

00:33:56,192 --> 00:33:59,996
It's my fault, my mistake.

00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:01,931
Here's how I
correct it.

00:34:01,931 --> 00:34:04,934
You drop the drug charges
on Lonny...

00:34:04,934 --> 00:34:08,104
and I'll tell you everything.

00:34:08,104 --> 00:34:10,606
BRASS:
Well, thanks to Maurice
Gallows' confession,

00:34:10,606 --> 00:34:14,143
Leslie Gitig
just got sprung,

00:34:14,143 --> 00:34:18,047
and our perv John Lee
just made bail.

00:34:18,047 --> 00:34:19,849
I'm telling you, it pays
to have rich parents.

00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:21,217
I don't see
the dad doing it.

00:34:21,217 --> 00:34:24,387
No, no, man, he's taking
the rap for his son.

00:34:24,387 --> 00:34:27,323
Okay, so Lonny's dealing
drugs for Chambliss,

00:34:27,323 --> 00:34:30,192
gets hooked, starts dipping
into his boss' supply.

00:34:30,192 --> 00:34:32,928
Cal cuts him off, and Lonny
just decides to gets even.

00:34:32,928 --> 00:34:34,230
ECKLIE:
Great,

00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:36,399
so our only viable suspect
is the one person

00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:37,967
who hasn't confessed
to the crime.

00:34:43,472 --> 00:34:46,042
Any thoughts?

00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:48,377
Yeah.

00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:50,079
Who killed Cock Robin?

00:34:52,415 --> 00:34:54,617
Those shrooms in your office
aren't medicinal, are they?

00:34:54,617 --> 00:34:56,252
"I," said the Sparrow.

00:34:56,252 --> 00:34:59,255
"With my bow and arrow,
I killed Cock Robin."

00:34:59,255 --> 00:35:00,256
Who saw him die?

00:35:00,256 --> 00:35:01,991
"I," said the Fly.

00:35:01,991 --> 00:35:04,326
"With my little eye,
I saw him die."

00:35:04,326 --> 00:35:06,195
"I," said the Fish,
"I," said...

00:35:06,195 --> 00:35:07,496
Oh, come on.

00:35:07,496 --> 00:35:08,898
All right, forget
folk songs.

00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:10,900
Uh, crime novels.

00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,601
<i>Strangers on a Train.</i>
ECKLIE:
Yeah, I saw the movie.

00:35:12,601 --> 00:35:14,203
What's, what's
your point?

00:35:14,203 --> 00:35:15,471
The p...
(sighs)

00:35:15,471 --> 00:35:16,839
Nick, when you were
hooking up Lonny,

00:35:16,839 --> 00:35:17,907
what did his father say--
exact words?

00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:19,842
He said,

00:35:19,842 --> 00:35:21,277
"I did it, I'm the one who
killed the Chambliss family."

00:35:21,277 --> 00:35:23,279
"I," said John Lee,

00:35:23,279 --> 00:35:27,116
"I did it, I'm the one who
killed the Chambliss family."

00:35:27,116 --> 00:35:29,018
"I," said Leslie Gitig,

00:35:29,018 --> 00:35:30,586
"I did it,
I'm the one who killed

00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:32,254
the Chambliss family."

00:35:32,254 --> 00:35:33,622
Now, that's three confessions,

00:35:33,622 --> 00:35:35,357
all identical.

00:35:35,357 --> 00:35:37,159
Hell of a coincidence.
So it's like they got

00:35:37,159 --> 00:35:38,194
their stories straight.

00:35:38,194 --> 00:35:39,361
They were working together.

00:35:39,361 --> 00:35:40,930
STOKES: <i>Strangers</i>
<i>on a Train.</i>

00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,965
Total strangers get together
to commit a crime,

00:35:42,965 --> 00:35:44,834
figuring the cops won't
make the connection.

00:35:44,834 --> 00:35:46,168
And each one of
them had motive

00:35:46,168 --> 00:35:47,870
to do harm to someone
in that family.

00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:48,871
ECKLIE:
And each had

00:35:48,871 --> 00:35:50,206
reason to confess.

00:35:50,206 --> 00:35:51,974
By all confessing,
they muddied the water.

00:35:51,974 --> 00:35:53,409
There is
no perfect crime,

00:35:53,409 --> 00:35:55,144
but if you create
enough reasonable doubt,

00:35:55,144 --> 00:35:56,979
you might just have
the perfect defense.

00:35:56,979 --> 00:35:58,614
And that's something
a legal secretary would know.

00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:00,082
ECKLIE:
Now,

00:36:00,082 --> 00:36:01,183
how do we get
around reasonable doubt?

00:36:03,052 --> 00:36:04,420
Find the train.

00:36:07,256 --> 00:36:09,125
WILLOWS:
<i>All right, thank you.</i>

00:36:11,193 --> 00:36:13,996
So I just spoke with the owner
of Benson's Auto Body.

00:36:13,996 --> 00:36:14,997
Two weeks ago,

00:36:14,997 --> 00:36:17,433
Leslie Gitig
paid him $4,500.

00:36:17,433 --> 00:36:18,934
Benson's Auto Body?

00:36:18,934 --> 00:36:20,202
That's where
John Lee works.

00:36:20,202 --> 00:36:21,370
Could be
where they met.

00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:22,571
Leslie's BMW was

00:36:22,571 --> 00:36:24,373
in an accident

00:36:24,373 --> 00:36:26,175
and she didn't want to run it
through her insurance.

00:36:26,175 --> 00:36:27,910
She paid cash, but not just
for her repair but

00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:29,145
for the truck that
she plowed into.

00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:30,479
Truck, what kind of truck?

00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:31,947
I don't know,
the driver

00:36:31,947 --> 00:36:33,315
hasn't brought it in yet.

00:36:33,315 --> 00:36:35,584
Maybe 'cause he needed it
for work.

00:36:35,584 --> 00:36:38,154
I saw a couple of thousand
dollars worth of damage

00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:39,421
to Maurice Gallows' truck.

00:36:39,421 --> 00:36:41,423
All right,

00:36:41,423 --> 00:36:42,958
well, sounds like

00:36:42,958 --> 00:36:44,260
we need to take
a look at that truck,

00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:46,162
compare the damage
to Leslie's car.

00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:47,396
I'll take the truck.

00:36:47,396 --> 00:36:49,832
Greg and I'll take the Beemer.

00:36:51,934 --> 00:36:55,337
WOMAN (over radio):
Victor 2-4, Victor 2-4. Come in.

00:36:55,337 --> 00:36:57,273
Nice job matching
the color.

00:36:57,273 --> 00:36:59,208
Well, yeah,
to the naked eye anyway.

00:37:01,377 --> 00:37:04,213
(beeping)

00:37:06,382 --> 00:37:08,484
Yep, left-side damage.

00:37:08,484 --> 00:37:10,519
I'll call for a warrant.

00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:11,954
(gunshots)

00:37:11,954 --> 00:37:13,322
3-David-34.

00:37:13,322 --> 00:37:15,391
Shots fired. Request
backup at our location.

00:37:15,391 --> 00:37:18,460
2-David-3-4, copy that.
4-34 call.

00:37:28,971 --> 00:37:29,972
We got one down.

00:37:40,182 --> 00:37:41,850
(gasps)

00:37:42,952 --> 00:37:44,853
We need rescue

00:37:44,853 --> 00:37:47,189
at 10923
Cartland Avenue.

00:37:47,189 --> 00:37:49,358
Gunshot victim.
OFFICER:
Put the gun down!

00:37:49,358 --> 00:37:50,392
Put the gun down! Now!

00:37:50,392 --> 00:37:51,393
Stay with her.

00:37:51,393 --> 00:37:53,362
OFFICER:
Drop the gun.

00:37:53,362 --> 00:37:54,363
John...

00:37:54,363 --> 00:37:56,398
please...

00:37:56,398 --> 00:37:58,200
do what he says.

00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,235
Put down the gun.

00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:00,469
(sobbing)

00:38:00,469 --> 00:38:03,339
They made me go there.

00:38:03,339 --> 00:38:04,907
She made me.

00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:06,408
Leslie?

00:38:06,408 --> 00:38:08,911
She said I could have her,

00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:11,981
but she didn't tell
me what we had to do.

00:38:11,981 --> 00:38:15,084
And then the screaming started.

00:38:16,852 --> 00:38:18,887
The shooting--

00:38:18,887 --> 00:38:23,325
it was so loud and
there was blood.

00:38:23,325 --> 00:38:25,261
There was so much blood.

00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:26,395
John, we can talk
about this.

00:38:26,395 --> 00:38:28,530
You've got to put the gun down.

00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:30,599
She said Fiona had to die.

00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:32,468
She gave me
her gun...

00:38:32,468 --> 00:38:35,004
this gun.

00:38:35,004 --> 00:38:36,505
(screams)
Oh, shut up!

00:38:36,505 --> 00:38:38,274
<i>I just couldn't do it.</i>
Give me that.

00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:39,575
No, no!

00:38:39,575 --> 00:38:41,043
(gunshot)

00:38:41,043 --> 00:38:43,979
She was so beautiful.

00:38:43,979 --> 00:38:47,049
I didn't want to
remember her like that,

00:38:47,049 --> 00:38:48,484
so I came back

00:38:48,484 --> 00:38:50,352
<i>afterward.</i>

00:38:56,358 --> 00:38:59,395
That awful woman.

00:38:59,395 --> 00:39:04,366
Sh-She took my
Fiona away from me.

00:39:04,366 --> 00:39:05,934
(distant siren blaring)

00:39:05,934 --> 00:39:10,939
Now... I have nothing.

00:39:10,939 --> 00:39:12,007
(gunshot)
(gasps)

00:39:15,911 --> 00:39:18,614
RUSSELL:
We found the murder weapons
at Leslie Gitig's house.

00:39:18,614 --> 00:39:21,383
Knife, gun-- the real one.

00:39:21,383 --> 00:39:22,951
I killed Chambliss

00:39:22,951 --> 00:39:24,053
and his family,
like I said.

00:39:24,053 --> 00:39:25,454
Well,

00:39:25,454 --> 00:39:28,090
it's a good story,
but this gun tells

00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:30,059
a better one.

00:39:30,059 --> 00:39:32,194
Maurice, your son did it.

00:39:32,194 --> 00:39:33,529
BRASS:
The gun goes back to him,

00:39:33,529 --> 00:39:35,130
<i>so unless you make us</i>
<i>understand</i>

00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:36,432
<i>what really happened,</i>

00:39:36,432 --> 00:39:38,000
Lonny's going to
get the needle.

00:39:39,535 --> 00:39:43,872
This is crazy, you know, I...

00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:45,474
I'd blame Leslie.

00:39:45,474 --> 00:39:47,609
It wasn't like she hit
your truck by accident.

00:39:47,609 --> 00:39:49,478
That's just the beginning
of the damage she did

00:39:49,478 --> 00:39:50,913
to you and your family.

00:39:50,913 --> 00:39:53,048
There are no
accidents, right?

00:39:53,048 --> 00:39:54,616
A woman scorned

00:39:54,616 --> 00:39:57,986
parks outside her ex-lover's
house night after night,

00:39:57,986 --> 00:39:59,621
thinking about how
to destroy him?

00:39:59,621 --> 00:40:02,424
<i>What does she see?</i>

00:40:02,424 --> 00:40:04,893
<i>A pedophile lusting</i>
<i>after a little girl...</i>

00:40:04,893 --> 00:40:06,395
Stop pushing
drugs on my son

00:40:06,395 --> 00:40:08,163
or I swear I
will kill you.
<i>...and a father</i>

00:40:08,163 --> 00:40:09,298
<i>fighting for his son.</i>
You and your whole family!

00:40:09,298 --> 00:40:11,133
<i>Three strangers</i>

00:40:11,133 --> 00:40:12,434
who all want
something.

00:40:12,434 --> 00:40:14,436
They just need to meet.

00:40:16,305 --> 00:40:18,574
I did everything I could
to get Lonny clean,

00:40:18,574 --> 00:40:22,244
and it was working.

00:40:22,244 --> 00:40:24,880
Then he met Cal,
and I was losing him again.

00:40:28,117 --> 00:40:31,520
She swore
it was just going to be Cal.

00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,222
Cal's expecting me.

00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:34,223
MAURICE:
<i>She lied.</i>

00:40:35,557 --> 00:40:39,161
(screaming)

00:40:39,161 --> 00:40:41,330
What are you waiting for?

00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:45,200
MAURICE:
<i>Once I stepped into that house,</i>
<i>I had no choice.</i>

00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:49,471
(gunshot)

00:40:49,471 --> 00:40:50,606
Run!

00:40:50,606 --> 00:40:52,007
No!

00:40:52,007 --> 00:40:53,142
(screams)

00:40:53,142 --> 00:40:55,411
(gasps)
You bitch!

00:41:02,951 --> 00:41:04,019
(screaming)

00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:09,057
(Fiona screaming)
Give me that.

00:41:09,057 --> 00:41:10,025
No, no!

00:41:10,025 --> 00:41:11,927
(hammer cocks, gunshot)

00:41:13,595 --> 00:41:16,432
You know what it's like
to lose a kid to drugs,

00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:18,200
to wish the world for 'em

00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:21,136
and see that world
come crashing down around 'em?

00:41:23,071 --> 00:41:24,907
I do,

00:41:24,907 --> 00:41:26,275
actually.

00:41:29,845 --> 00:41:31,847
I do.

00:41:31,847 --> 00:41:33,882
But it still

00:41:33,882 --> 00:41:35,918
doesn't justify killing
a whole family.

00:41:47,563 --> 00:41:50,399
(footsteps approaching,
knocking at door)

00:41:50,399 --> 00:41:51,967
I'm going to head out.

00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:52,968
You need anything?

00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:55,103
No, I'm good, thank you.

00:41:55,103 --> 00:41:57,039
I'll see you tomorrow.

00:42:02,244 --> 00:42:03,579
"Cock Robin."

00:42:03,579 --> 00:42:05,881
Really?
(chuckles)

00:42:05,881 --> 00:42:06,882
What journal

00:42:06,882 --> 00:42:08,584
did you get that one from?

00:42:08,584 --> 00:42:11,253
My parents were singers,

00:42:11,253 --> 00:42:14,623
and that was kind of a
favorite around our, our van.

00:42:14,623 --> 00:42:15,858
Oh.

00:42:15,858 --> 00:42:17,893
Go with what you know, right?

00:42:17,893 --> 00:42:19,127
Yeah.

00:42:19,127 --> 00:42:21,830
Well, it worked,
it really worked.

00:42:22,898 --> 00:42:24,566
What's going on?

00:42:24,566 --> 00:42:25,567
Are you all right?

00:42:25,567 --> 00:42:27,402
(phone buzzing)

00:42:33,242 --> 00:42:34,843
Aren't you going
to get that?

00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:36,578
I don't want to be rude.

00:42:36,578 --> 00:42:38,480
Oh, be rude.

00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,615
Good night.

00:42:39,615 --> 00:42:41,250
(phone continues buzzing)

00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:43,619
Good night.

00:42:43,619 --> 00:42:45,020
Hey, doll,

00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,622
how are you?

00:42:46,622 --> 00:42:48,357
Uh, don't worry
about it.

00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:50,259
I-I'll pick something up
for us on the way home.

00:42:50,259 --> 00:42:53,562
Yeah, hey, hey, wait, how, how
did Charlie do in practice?
