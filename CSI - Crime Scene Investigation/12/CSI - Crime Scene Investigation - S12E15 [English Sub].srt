00:00:08,402 --> 00:00:11,164
So, uh... you are
dating that nurse.

00:00:11,164 --> 00:00:13,066
Uh-huh. Kind of.
MAN:
I have to work with you?!

00:00:13,066 --> 00:00:15,034
Uh-huh. And what happened
to Doc Robbins' niece?

00:00:15,034 --> 00:00:17,103
Oh, nothing.
I'm just keeping
my options open.

00:00:17,103 --> 00:00:18,771
I called her, genius.

00:00:18,771 --> 00:00:20,106
She's not answering
her cell phone.

00:00:20,106 --> 00:00:21,340
Why do you think

00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:23,109
I called you people?
You know what?

00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:25,111
I want to talk to your boss.
I want to talk to him now.

00:00:25,111 --> 00:00:27,714
She's busy.
"She."

00:00:27,714 --> 00:00:29,048
All right,
what's going on, Mitch?

00:00:29,048 --> 00:00:30,249
Meet Dwayne Hicks.

00:00:30,249 --> 00:00:32,618
He reported his wife missing.

00:00:32,618 --> 00:00:33,352
He's all yours.

00:00:35,021 --> 00:00:37,056
Mr. Hicks, I'm Nick Stokes.
This is Sara Sidle.

00:00:37,056 --> 00:00:38,891
We're with the
crime scene unit.

00:00:38,891 --> 00:00:40,326
When's the last time
you saw your wife?

00:00:40,326 --> 00:00:41,694
Last night.

00:00:41,694 --> 00:00:43,129
Debbie and I had an early dinner

00:00:43,129 --> 00:00:45,231
and then I went to work.
And where do you work?

00:00:45,231 --> 00:00:48,067
What the hell does that have
to do with you finding my wife?

00:00:48,067 --> 00:00:50,269
Are you refusing to
answer the question?
Okay, look...

00:00:50,269 --> 00:00:51,871
Mr. Hicks...

00:00:51,871 --> 00:00:53,306
we're just trying to
help you out, man.

00:00:53,306 --> 00:00:56,275
All right.
I work as a night manager

00:00:56,275 --> 00:00:58,144
at the Swift Deal, okay?

00:00:58,144 --> 00:00:59,612
All right. And, uh...

00:00:59,612 --> 00:01:01,280
where was the last place
that you saw Debbie?

00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,882
Deb... yeah, Debbie.

00:01:02,882 --> 00:01:04,150
At home.

00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:07,653
You want to know
what we ate, too?

00:01:07,653 --> 00:01:09,222
Um...

00:01:09,222 --> 00:01:10,256
which house is yours?

00:01:10,256 --> 00:01:11,991
Five twenty-eight.

00:01:18,197 --> 00:01:20,066
The vacant lot.

00:01:20,066 --> 00:01:22,702
Yeah, it's a vacant lot because
someone stole my house.

00:01:22,702 --> 00:01:26,072
So you're saying when you
went to work last night,

00:01:26,072 --> 00:01:28,641
the house was there,
and your wife was inside?

00:01:28,641 --> 00:01:30,877
Yes.
And now they're
both missing.

00:01:30,877 --> 00:01:33,312
Ye... that is what I'm
trying to tell you people!

00:01:33,312 --> 00:01:34,680
Come on!

00:01:36,783 --> 00:01:39,018
So you think somebody was after
the house, or the wife?

00:01:45,158 --> 00:01:47,226
Oh, that's great!

00:01:47,226 --> 00:01:48,995
DWAYNE:

Is your name Julie Finlay?

00:02:37,343 --> 00:02:38,644
Yes.

00:02:38,644 --> 00:02:40,012
And were you
born in Philadelphia?

00:02:40,012 --> 00:02:41,013
Yes.

00:02:41,013 --> 00:02:43,950
Have you used any illegal drugs,

00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:46,285
including marijuana,
in the last ten years?

00:02:46,285 --> 00:02:48,321
No.

00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:53,226
Hm.

00:02:53,226 --> 00:02:54,961
Do you...

00:02:54,961 --> 00:02:56,963
...resent having my honesty
gauged by debunked

00:02:56,963 --> 00:02:58,965
pseudo-technology?

00:02:58,965 --> 00:03:01,667
Don't do that...
Yeah. A little bit.

00:03:01,667 --> 00:03:03,769
Please keep your answers
to a "yes" or "no."

00:03:03,769 --> 00:03:05,571
Yes.

00:03:05,571 --> 00:03:07,740
Do you have any
criminal history?

00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:10,243
I was married twice.

00:03:10,243 --> 00:03:11,611
Did my time.

00:03:11,611 --> 00:03:14,046
Have you ever had sex
with an animal?

00:03:14,046 --> 00:03:16,983
(laughs):
Oh, my... really?

00:03:16,983 --> 00:03:18,050
Oh, God.

00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:19,685
SPECIALIST:
Yes, or no?

00:03:19,685 --> 00:03:21,821
Well, my first ex-husband
was a bit of a dog.

00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:26,559
And my second, a pig.

00:03:26,559 --> 00:03:28,594
Does that count?

00:03:28,594 --> 00:03:30,062
I don't know why you bother.

00:03:30,062 --> 00:03:32,198
Those people never have
a sense of humor, you know that.

00:03:32,198 --> 00:03:33,866
I know. I couldn't help myself.

00:03:33,866 --> 00:03:35,968
Well, I did pass, didn't I?

00:03:35,968 --> 00:03:37,637
Welcome to Las Vegas.

00:03:39,138 --> 00:03:41,007
Ugh.

00:03:41,007 --> 00:03:43,276
Well, at least it's a better
picture than I took in Seattle.

00:03:43,276 --> 00:03:45,111
Things are looking up.

00:03:45,111 --> 00:03:47,246
Yeah. Um, hey, guys?

00:03:47,246 --> 00:03:50,216
Do me a favor,
come in here for a second?

00:03:50,216 --> 00:03:52,351
I want you to meet someone.

00:03:52,351 --> 00:03:56,222
Sara Sidle, Morgan Brody,
this is Julie Finlay.

00:03:56,222 --> 00:03:58,891
Uh... Finn,
with two N's.

00:03:58,891 --> 00:04:00,893
So nice to meet you.
Finn's coming on board.

00:04:00,893 --> 00:04:03,663
Oh. I heard about your, uh,
amazing blood reconstruction

00:04:03,663 --> 00:04:05,932
from Greg.
Oh...

00:04:05,932 --> 00:04:07,967
Why don't you guys
give her the official tour?

00:04:07,967 --> 00:04:09,835
I'd love to, but I'm due back

00:04:09,835 --> 00:04:10,836
at my crime scene.

00:04:10,836 --> 00:04:12,271
We have a house to find.

00:04:12,271 --> 00:04:13,940
But, uh, it's nice
to meet you, Finn.

00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,975
Nice to meet you.
I'll do it.

00:04:15,975 --> 00:04:18,044
I'll even give you
the unofficial tour.

00:04:18,044 --> 00:04:20,279
Nice.

00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,281
I like her already.

00:04:25,651 --> 00:04:27,586
This damage is recent.

00:04:27,586 --> 00:04:29,922
BRASS:
Yeah. Ran the plates.

00:04:29,922 --> 00:04:32,024
Car belongs to the missing wife,
Debbie Hicks.

00:04:32,024 --> 00:04:33,826
Supports the husband's story

00:04:33,826 --> 00:04:36,095
that the wife was inside the
house when the house was stolen.

00:04:36,095 --> 00:04:38,097
I mean, if you want
to kidnap someone,

00:04:38,097 --> 00:04:39,932
why take the whole house?

00:04:39,932 --> 00:04:41,567
Captain, I talked
to the neighbors.

00:04:41,567 --> 00:04:44,203
A couple of them saw the house
driving off last night.

00:04:44,203 --> 00:04:45,338
Thought the family was moving

00:04:45,338 --> 00:04:46,672
to another neighborhood.

00:04:46,672 --> 00:04:48,607
(rap music blaring)

00:04:53,045 --> 00:04:55,081
What the hell?

00:04:55,081 --> 00:04:56,582
What'd you do with the house?

00:04:56,582 --> 00:04:58,184
What do you mean, me?
You stole the house!

00:04:58,184 --> 00:05:00,586
I didn't do nothing, okay?
You stashed it away somewhere!

00:05:00,586 --> 00:05:02,154
DWAYNE: Really? Why would I
steal my own house?

00:05:02,154 --> 00:05:04,023
JIMMY: Because it's not
your house, Dwayne.

00:05:04,023 --> 00:05:05,825
STOKES:
Hey, calm down, now.
Oh, my God!

00:05:05,825 --> 00:05:07,660
Just 'cause you live in the
house doesn't make it yours.

00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,795
Possession is 9/10 of the law.
What are you,
a lawyer now?

00:05:09,795 --> 00:05:11,831
I don't need to
go to law school...
What happened to our house?

00:05:11,831 --> 00:05:14,133
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:05:14,133 --> 00:05:15,901
And you are...?
I'm Marla Hicks.

00:05:15,901 --> 00:05:17,803
I'm Dwayne and Jimmy's sister.

00:05:17,803 --> 00:05:19,739
Dwayne and Debbie
jacked our house, Marla.

00:05:19,739 --> 00:05:21,907
Debbie is missing, dumb-ass.
What?

00:05:21,907 --> 00:05:23,776
That is a load of crap.
Oh, is it?

00:05:23,776 --> 00:05:26,145
Okay, he has always been
trying to steal from me.
Oh, really?

00:05:26,145 --> 00:05:28,647
Ever since we were kids.
Are we going to do this out
in front of all these people?

00:05:28,647 --> 00:05:29,882
MARLA: Not right now!
Jimmy, not right now!

00:05:29,882 --> 00:05:31,317
...my Hot Wheels,
my pot, my Jarts.

00:05:31,317 --> 00:05:34,020
I loved those Jarts.
The Jarts were for both of us.

00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,021
(honks horn)

00:05:35,021 --> 00:05:36,856
It's a two-man game!

00:05:37,923 --> 00:05:39,592
A woman is missing,

00:05:39,592 --> 00:05:41,861
and this fighting
is not helping us find her.

00:05:41,861 --> 00:05:43,729
You know, that's
an excellent point.

00:05:43,729 --> 00:05:47,133
So let's take this
family feud downtown.

00:05:47,133 --> 00:05:49,735
Nice. Talk about pot more
in front of cops.

00:05:49,735 --> 00:05:51,337
Why don't you try and
steal the police station?

00:05:51,337 --> 00:05:52,738
MARLA:
Why don't you both shut up?

00:05:52,738 --> 00:05:53,739
JIMMY &amp; DWAYNE:
Shut up, Marla.

00:05:53,739 --> 00:05:54,740
MARLA:
Oh, funny.

00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,075
A family like that kind of

00:05:56,075 --> 00:05:57,777
makes me glad I'm an only child.

00:05:57,777 --> 00:05:59,578
Huh.

00:05:59,578 --> 00:06:01,914
STOKES: Well, maybe if we figure
out what happened to the house,

00:06:01,914 --> 00:06:04,050
we'll figure out
what happened to the wife.

00:06:25,971 --> 00:06:27,706
No prints.

00:06:27,706 --> 00:06:29,742
They didn't even bother
to turn the water off.

00:06:29,742 --> 00:06:33,212
They just sliced
right through the pipe.

00:06:33,212 --> 00:06:35,181
Well, there's four different
sets of shoe prints

00:06:35,181 --> 00:06:37,149
around the house.

00:06:37,149 --> 00:06:39,785
Is it even possible to
move a whole house overnight?

00:06:39,785 --> 00:06:41,854
Yeah. Yeah, actually, it is.

00:06:41,854 --> 00:06:43,589
And it's not really
that hard to do.

00:06:43,589 --> 00:06:46,092
<i>Just slide two support beams</i>
<i>under the joists,</i>

00:06:46,092 --> 00:06:47,259
<i>jack it up,</i>

00:06:47,259 --> 00:06:48,928
<i>lower it onto a flatbed...</i>

00:06:50,596 --> 00:06:52,331
<i>and off you go.</i>

00:06:53,966 --> 00:06:55,601
With the wife inside?

00:06:55,601 --> 00:06:57,069
Yeah, she had to have
been unconscious,

00:06:57,069 --> 00:06:58,904
or she would've heard something,

00:06:58,904 --> 00:07:00,739
or felt the house moving,
don't you think?

00:07:00,739 --> 00:07:02,074
Unless she was dead.

00:07:02,074 --> 00:07:04,009
Could be the perfect crime.

00:07:04,009 --> 00:07:06,579
No body, no crime scene.

00:07:06,579 --> 00:07:08,180
JIMMY:
<i>Debbie is a total bitch.</i>

00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:10,316
I'm surprised Dwayne's been
with her for this long.

00:07:10,316 --> 00:07:12,051
BRASS:
They're having marital problems?

00:07:12,051 --> 00:07:13,619
Hell, yeah.

00:07:13,619 --> 00:07:15,054
At each other's throats
night and day.

00:07:15,054 --> 00:07:16,188
About anything in particular?

00:07:16,188 --> 00:07:18,257
Money, mostly.

00:07:18,257 --> 00:07:20,559
You know, Debbie
loves her slots.

00:07:20,559 --> 00:07:23,062
She gambled away their savings.

00:07:23,062 --> 00:07:25,598
Wow. That must have
really pissed Dwayne off.

00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:27,800
Yeah, I was mad.

00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,335
We lost our condo.

00:07:29,335 --> 00:07:30,870
We had to move
back in with my mother.

00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,705
So the house
belongs to your mother.

00:07:32,705 --> 00:07:34,707
Where is she?
She's dead.

00:07:34,707 --> 00:07:36,275
Oh. Sorry for your loss.

00:07:36,275 --> 00:07:38,210
So your mom left you the house?

00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:39,778
She would've.

00:07:39,778 --> 00:07:40,779
If she had a will.

00:07:42,314 --> 00:07:44,350
Look, I don't know what
my idiot brother told you--

00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:45,818
and he is an idiot--

00:07:45,818 --> 00:07:48,821
but Debbie swore off
gambling, all right?

00:07:48,821 --> 00:07:51,891
So we... we are in
a good place right now.

00:07:51,891 --> 00:07:53,125
Okay?

00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:54,593
Oh, really?
Yeah.

00:07:54,593 --> 00:07:56,061
Because there was
a disturbance call

00:07:56,061 --> 00:07:58,631
at the Tasty Time last week,
involving you and your wife.

00:08:00,332 --> 00:08:01,967
All right.

00:08:01,967 --> 00:08:04,570
Debbie got a little
flirty with the fry guy.

00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:07,239
And she knows
how much I hate that.

00:08:07,239 --> 00:08:09,875
It seems you hate a lot
of things about your wife.

00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:11,110
Maybe enough to want her dead?

00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:12,711
Look, if I killed my wife,

00:08:12,711 --> 00:08:14,280
why would I be the one
to report her missing?

00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,915
Maybe to throw
suspicion off yourself

00:08:15,915 --> 00:08:17,816
and onto your "idiot brother".

00:08:17,816 --> 00:08:19,985
Well, why don't you find out
what he was doing last night?

00:08:19,985 --> 00:08:22,254
Getting the old rifle cleaned,
if you know what I mean.

00:08:22,254 --> 00:08:24,690
Lucky you. Where?
Black Stag.

00:08:25,758 --> 00:08:26,892
Why make that face?

00:08:26,892 --> 00:08:28,060
Where'd you go after?

00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,762
Home.
Alone?

00:08:29,762 --> 00:08:32,131
Yeah, alone. Why do you think
I had to pay for it?

00:08:32,131 --> 00:08:33,766
It says here you
work in construction?

00:08:33,766 --> 00:08:35,067
Off and on.

00:08:35,067 --> 00:08:36,869
I don't know if you've noticed,

00:08:36,869 --> 00:08:38,938
but not a lot of building
going on in Vegas these days.

00:08:38,938 --> 00:08:41,073
But you have the skills and
connections to move a house.

00:08:41,073 --> 00:08:43,709
And you said, I quote,
"Debbie's a total bitch."

00:08:43,709 --> 00:08:45,611
Look, I did not
steal that house.

00:08:45,611 --> 00:08:47,346
And I did not hurt Debbie.

00:08:47,346 --> 00:08:49,315
I love that you're
all up in my business.

00:08:49,315 --> 00:08:51,083
Have you even talked to Fred?

00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:54,153
Who's Fred?
Fred Blanchard.

00:08:54,153 --> 00:08:56,789
He and my dad had a dry-cleaning
business together.

00:08:56,789 --> 00:08:58,991
Until my dad stole all
their money and took off.

00:08:58,991 --> 00:08:59,992
When was that?

00:08:59,992 --> 00:09:01,594
Ten years ago.

00:09:01,594 --> 00:09:03,829
I haven't seen or
heard from him since.

00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:05,197
Tough growing up without a dad.

00:09:05,197 --> 00:09:07,266
You didn't know my father.

00:09:07,266 --> 00:09:08,701
Him leaving was the best thing

00:09:08,701 --> 00:09:10,169
that ever happened
to our family.

00:09:10,169 --> 00:09:11,737
He was a real son of a bitch.

00:09:11,737 --> 00:09:13,939
Your brothers think that
Fred stole the house.

00:09:13,939 --> 00:09:15,641
Fred? No.

00:09:15,641 --> 00:09:17,343
Fred would never do that.

00:09:17,343 --> 00:09:20,913
He was there for us the
second my dad left, and...

00:09:20,913 --> 00:09:23,616
actually, a few years ago,
he and my mom got really close

00:09:23,616 --> 00:09:24,750
and he moved in.

00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,852
So Fred was living
in the house too.

00:09:26,852 --> 00:09:27,853
Yeah.

00:09:27,853 --> 00:09:29,688
Until my mom died.

00:09:29,688 --> 00:09:31,957
And then Dwayne kicked him out.

00:09:31,957 --> 00:09:33,692
I'm sure it was Debbie's idea.

00:09:33,692 --> 00:09:34,960
What about you?

00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,328
I mean, no will.

00:09:36,328 --> 00:09:39,898
The house is just as much
yours as it is theirs.

00:09:39,898 --> 00:09:43,168
I... I don't want any part
of that damn house.

00:09:43,168 --> 00:09:44,803
I'm glad it's gone.

00:09:44,803 --> 00:09:47,273
You glad Debbie's gone, too?

00:09:47,273 --> 00:09:48,907
I didn't like her, but...

00:09:48,907 --> 00:09:52,211
I never wanted anything
bad to happen to her.

00:09:57,816 --> 00:10:00,619
SANDERS: I heard you and Finn
worked together in Seattle.

00:10:00,619 --> 00:10:02,788
Yeah, yeah. Heard right.

00:10:02,788 --> 00:10:04,556
Rumor has it you fired her.

00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:08,193
Right again.

00:10:08,193 --> 00:10:11,163
So that means there's a good
story in there somewhere.

00:10:11,163 --> 00:10:13,699
David! What the hell
you got here, buddy?

00:10:13,699 --> 00:10:16,168
Road kill.
Lost an arm and a leg.

00:10:16,168 --> 00:10:18,337
I.D.?
No I.D., but...

00:10:18,337 --> 00:10:20,239
check out these tread marks.

00:10:26,145 --> 00:10:29,214
About 22 inches, give or take.

00:10:29,214 --> 00:10:31,317
This is only sixteen.

00:10:31,317 --> 00:10:34,787
So our guy was run over
by at least one big-rig

00:10:34,787 --> 00:10:36,288
and maybe
a car or two.

00:10:36,288 --> 00:10:38,957
90 degrees. He's been dead
around eight hours.

00:10:38,957 --> 00:10:40,659
SANDERS:
Died last night.

00:10:40,659 --> 00:10:42,895
Not a lot of streetlights.

00:10:42,895 --> 00:10:44,330
Would've been hard to
see in the dark.

00:10:48,867 --> 00:10:50,269
Hey, there's a bar back there.

00:10:50,269 --> 00:10:51,837
Maybe he, uh,
hit the hooch

00:10:51,837 --> 00:10:54,306
and hit the road.

00:10:54,306 --> 00:10:56,575
You know, for someone who got
run over a couple times,

00:10:56,575 --> 00:10:57,943
I'm not seeing a lot of blood.

00:10:57,943 --> 00:10:59,211
Hey...

00:10:59,211 --> 00:11:00,179
Check this out.

00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,781
Blanched skin.

00:11:02,781 --> 00:11:05,050
His injuries
have an orange tone.

00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:07,019
So the blood wasn't circulating.

00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:08,287
He was dead before
he was run over.

00:11:08,287 --> 00:11:09,655
Yeah, this isn't a hit-and-run.

00:11:09,655 --> 00:11:11,223
This is a dump-and-run.

00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:14,660
(typing)

00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,695
HODGES:
528.

00:11:16,695 --> 00:11:18,697
That's the right address.

00:11:18,697 --> 00:11:21,266
As opposed to the other houses
that were stolen last night?

00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:26,638
Any of these guys

00:11:26,638 --> 00:11:28,340
the Hicks brothers
or Fred Blanchard?

00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:31,910
No, but any of them could've
hired these guys.

00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:34,847
Or it was just a random
house-stealing.

00:11:34,847 --> 00:11:37,716
Or maybe Debbie Hicks
was still gambling,

00:11:37,716 --> 00:11:39,585
and she owed
somebody some money,

00:11:39,585 --> 00:11:41,653
and they took her
and the house as payment.

00:11:41,653 --> 00:11:42,921
Let's get a closer look
at that guy.

00:11:42,921 --> 00:11:44,623
(mouse clicks)

00:11:47,926 --> 00:11:49,194
Where was this taken?

00:11:49,194 --> 00:11:51,830
Corner of Sunset and Barlow.

00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,932
But there's no other
traffic-cam footage after that.

00:11:53,932 --> 00:11:56,068
Doesn't mean we can't track it.

00:11:56,068 --> 00:11:57,336
You must be Finn.

00:11:57,336 --> 00:11:58,904
You must be Stokes.
Yes, ma'am.

00:11:58,904 --> 00:12:00,272
Hi. David Hodges.

00:12:00,272 --> 00:12:02,775
Anything you need to
know about Sin City,

00:12:02,775 --> 00:12:04,143
I'm your man.

00:12:04,143 --> 00:12:05,911
Russell tells me
you're quite the insider.

00:12:05,911 --> 00:12:06,912
Well...

00:12:06,912 --> 00:12:07,913
Yeah, how did you you duck

00:12:07,913 --> 00:12:09,047
the "sex with animals"

00:12:09,047 --> 00:12:10,182
question on
your polygraph?

00:12:10,182 --> 00:12:12,751
Given your tentacle porn fetish.

00:12:12,751 --> 00:12:14,052
Yeah.

00:12:14,052 --> 00:12:15,754
Russell told you about that.

00:12:15,754 --> 00:12:16,989
Mm-hmm.

00:12:16,989 --> 00:12:18,824
What do you have for us?

00:12:18,824 --> 00:12:22,561
Well, it looks like our house
thieves were pretty sloppy.

00:12:22,561 --> 00:12:25,164
I accessed all the
911 calls from last night.

00:12:25,164 --> 00:12:27,099
Several reports
of downed power lines,

00:12:27,099 --> 00:12:28,700
as well as a dozens of reports

00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,570
of sideswiped cars
and other property damage.

00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:34,706
Looks like "Housezilla" left
quite a path of destruction.

00:12:34,706 --> 00:12:36,775
Follow the destruction,
find the house.

00:12:36,775 --> 00:12:37,976
Yeah, and maybe Debbie.

00:12:45,284 --> 00:12:46,785
Hmm...

00:12:47,953 --> 00:12:51,123
FINLAY:
House is heading east.

00:12:51,123 --> 00:12:52,991
What's over there?

00:12:52,991 --> 00:12:55,861
STOKES:
About a hundred miles of desert.

00:12:55,861 --> 00:12:57,229
That's a lot of ground to cover.

00:12:57,229 --> 00:12:59,965
Not if you have
eyes in the sky.

00:12:59,965 --> 00:13:01,600
I like the way
you think.

00:13:02,835 --> 00:13:04,703
Jim. Stokes.

00:13:04,703 --> 00:13:05,871
We need a chopper.

00:13:25,991 --> 00:13:27,860
(Russell, Finlay laugh)

00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:28,894
Will you look at this!

00:13:30,863 --> 00:13:34,166
You, uh, want to wrap it up,
take it back to the lab?

00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:35,634
RUSSELL:
Yeah! (laughs)

00:13:35,634 --> 00:13:36,802
You're still doing that?

00:13:36,802 --> 00:13:38,170
If it ain't broke.

00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:41,340
Hook up the satellite,
I want to live here.

00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,941
FINLAY:
It's nice and quiet.

00:13:42,941 --> 00:13:44,643
No annoying neighbors.

00:13:45,844 --> 00:13:49,114
Well, maybe one,
but he's quiet.

00:13:49,114 --> 00:13:51,216
Those are guys' legs.

00:13:51,216 --> 00:13:53,051
It's definitely
not Debbie Hicks.

00:13:53,051 --> 00:13:55,287
Ruby red shoes.

00:13:55,287 --> 00:13:57,823
I have a feeling
we're not in Kansas anymore.

00:14:05,297 --> 00:14:07,933
(wood creaking)

00:14:17,075 --> 00:14:18,076
Do you need a hand?

00:14:18,076 --> 00:14:19,978
Oh, no, I've got it.

00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,848
Thanks.
I'm Finn.

00:14:22,848 --> 00:14:24,683
David. Welcome aboard.
Thank you.

00:14:25,784 --> 00:14:27,286
PHILLIPS:
Oh...

00:14:27,286 --> 00:14:29,555
Chest is completely concave.

00:14:29,555 --> 00:14:31,123
Obvious death;
crushing injuries.

00:14:31,123 --> 00:14:32,691
Uh-huh.
Hmm.

00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:42,668
These shoes
match the impressions

00:14:42,668 --> 00:14:44,636
I found at the Hicks property.

00:14:44,636 --> 00:14:46,705
He's definitely one
of the house stealers.

00:14:46,705 --> 00:14:47,873
Has he got
an I.D. on him?

00:14:55,314 --> 00:14:57,082
"Dennis Hutchings."

00:14:57,082 --> 00:14:59,217
I recognize him from
the surveillance video.

00:15:03,655 --> 00:15:04,923
RUSSELL:
Finn, do me a favor,

00:15:04,923 --> 00:15:06,658
and get a picture
of that jack under there.

00:15:06,658 --> 00:15:09,094
Okay.

00:15:09,094 --> 00:15:10,729
RUSSELL: Actually,
you know what?

00:15:10,729 --> 00:15:12,030
I think I got something
in the truck

00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,732
we can use
to get that out of there.

00:15:15,567 --> 00:15:16,568
I got it.

00:15:16,568 --> 00:15:17,569
What are you doing?

00:15:17,569 --> 00:15:18,570
Aw, come on, Jules!

00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:19,905
Don't call me that!

00:15:19,905 --> 00:15:21,306
Well, get out from
under there, will ya?

00:15:22,674 --> 00:15:23,809
Unbelievable.

00:15:25,744 --> 00:15:27,079
Here you go.

00:15:27,079 --> 00:15:30,115
You know, I bet I know
what happened.

00:15:30,115 --> 00:15:32,150
I bet you they were trying
to lower the house,

00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:34,586
this one got jammed,

00:15:34,586 --> 00:15:37,289
Mr. Hutchings here tried
to fix it.

00:15:39,324 --> 00:15:40,993
(wood creaking)

00:15:50,102 --> 00:15:52,270
Cause of death:
terminal stupidity.

00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:54,206
Cause of death: karma.

00:15:54,206 --> 00:15:56,074
Guy steals house,
house kills guy.

00:15:56,074 --> 00:15:58,343
Hey, fellas,
lower it back down, will you?

00:15:58,343 --> 00:16:00,312
MAN:
Yes, sir!
We should probably get in there.

00:16:00,312 --> 00:16:02,347
It's time to figure out
what happened to Debbie Hicks.

00:16:14,292 --> 00:16:17,796
It's hard to tell if this mess
was from a struggle or what.

00:16:22,067 --> 00:16:24,770
Well, I can tell you
that this was...

00:16:28,974 --> 00:16:31,643
Does not bode well for Debbie.

00:16:31,643 --> 00:16:33,345
Blood pool's over a liter.

00:16:33,345 --> 00:16:35,981
Nobody can survive
that volume of blood loss.

00:16:35,981 --> 00:16:38,250
Injuries and death
occurred here.

00:16:40,352 --> 00:16:43,889
Drag marks leading
to the kitchen door here.

00:16:43,889 --> 00:16:45,290
So whoever killed her

00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:47,559
dumped her body before
they dumped the house.

00:16:49,594 --> 00:16:51,263
High-velocity spatter.

00:16:51,263 --> 00:16:53,699
If that's from a gunshot,
it must have been a revolver.

00:16:53,699 --> 00:16:56,001
I don't see
any casings laying around.

00:16:56,001 --> 00:16:58,070
Killer could've picked them up,
though, right?

00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:00,305
STOKES:
Yeah.

00:17:00,305 --> 00:17:02,774
Yeah, one single air bubble.

00:17:02,774 --> 00:17:04,309
Spatter's not from a shooting.

Well, we have a castoff pattern,
relatively short arc--

00:17:13,752 --> 00:17:16,755
one, two, three--
could be from a beating.

00:17:16,755 --> 00:17:18,190
Maybe Debbie put up a fight

00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:19,858
when Hutchings came
to steal the house.

00:17:19,858 --> 00:17:21,326
He could've brought tools,
right?

00:17:21,326 --> 00:17:23,095
Maybe a hammer, a crowbar.

00:17:23,095 --> 00:17:26,865
Short castoff arcs with no
associated medium-force spatter.

00:17:26,865 --> 00:17:28,600
Indicative of
sharp-force trauma.

00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,602
So you're thinking stabbing.

First stab's always for free.

00:17:39,978 --> 00:17:42,681

single-edged.

00:36:38,015 --> 00:36:39,583
Yeah, it must have
been hard on her.

00:36:39,583 --> 00:36:41,852
Losing somebody that
she loved that much.

00:36:44,255 --> 00:36:46,857
My mother always had
this sadness about her.

00:36:49,193 --> 00:36:50,928
Now I know why.

00:36:54,965 --> 00:36:56,767
(door opens)

00:36:56,767 --> 00:36:58,335
BRASS:
You know, it's funny.

00:36:58,335 --> 00:37:00,704
When we were looking for you,
we couldn't find any record

00:37:00,704 --> 00:37:02,306
of a Walter Hicks since 2002.

00:37:02,306 --> 00:37:03,908
But then we ran your full name,

00:37:03,908 --> 00:37:07,011
Walter Douglas Hicks,
and wouldn't you know it,

00:37:07,011 --> 00:37:09,713
there's a Walter Douglas
living in New Mexico.

00:37:09,713 --> 00:37:11,248
RUSSELL:
Who just happened to use

00:37:11,248 --> 00:37:14,184
his credit card here in Vegas
two days ago.

00:37:14,184 --> 00:37:15,819
BRASS:
So it's been ten years, Walter.

00:37:15,819 --> 00:37:17,621
What brings you
back to the city?

00:37:17,621 --> 00:37:18,889
Gambling? Nightlife?

00:37:18,889 --> 00:37:20,624
Or... maybe this.

00:37:20,624 --> 00:37:22,726
BRASS: CSI found it
in your old house.

00:37:24,128 --> 00:37:26,297
I haven't lived there
in ten years.

00:37:26,297 --> 00:37:29,266
Tony Perrella's been
dead for 20.
Who?

00:37:29,266 --> 00:37:30,868
Your handyman.

00:37:30,868 --> 00:37:32,336
We have some invoices here

00:37:32,336 --> 00:37:34,772
that said Tony spent a lot
of time at your house.

00:37:34,772 --> 00:37:35,940
Doing repairs.

00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,908
Your wife.

00:37:37,908 --> 00:37:39,343
RUSSELL:
We also found love letters

00:37:39,343 --> 00:37:41,278
that Tony wrote to your wife.

00:37:41,278 --> 00:37:44,982
I'm pretty sure you
found them too, right?

00:37:44,982 --> 00:37:47,851
And that's why you killed him.

00:37:47,851 --> 00:37:49,286
Love letters?
That's all you got?

00:37:49,286 --> 00:37:51,221
No, actually,
we have a lot more.

00:37:51,221 --> 00:37:52,957
We have some, uh, some receipts.

00:37:52,957 --> 00:37:55,693
For some, uh, 2x4s,

00:37:55,693 --> 00:37:58,162
spackling, drywall,
from a local hardware store.

00:37:58,162 --> 00:38:00,597
Right around the time that
Tony was reported missing.

00:38:02,066 --> 00:38:03,867
RUSSELL: Yeah, don't forget
that large bottle

00:38:03,867 --> 00:38:06,270
of Stink Away.
Stink Away. Right here.

00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:09,907
BRASS: Ravenson Hardware
keeps impeccable records.

00:38:09,907 --> 00:38:11,175
You remember Tony now?

00:38:15,813 --> 00:38:19,116
Lois took the boys to
her mother for the week.

00:38:19,116 --> 00:38:22,319
I... got Tony to
come to the house.

00:38:22,319 --> 00:38:23,687
You think you can screw my wife?

00:38:23,687 --> 00:38:25,622
Huh?
I love Lois.

00:38:25,622 --> 00:38:27,791
You don't give
a damn about her.
You stay the hell away from her.

00:38:27,791 --> 00:38:29,727
WALTER:
<i>He said he wanted to</i>
<i>fight for her.</i>

00:38:32,196 --> 00:38:33,831
He lost.

00:38:51,215 --> 00:38:53,317
You got away with murder.

00:38:53,317 --> 00:38:55,119
Too bad Lois died, right?

00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:56,720
Probably got a little worried,

00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,989
maybe someone'd buy the house
and find the body.

00:38:58,989 --> 00:39:00,691
So you came back
to move it.

00:39:00,691 --> 00:39:03,293
And guess who shows up.

00:39:03,293 --> 00:39:06,563
BRASS:
<i>Your old business</i>
<i>partner, Fred.</i>

00:39:06,563 --> 00:39:09,800
What the hell
are you doing here?

00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,036
Heard about Lois.

00:39:12,036 --> 00:39:14,938
What? And you came
to pay your respects?

00:39:14,938 --> 00:39:16,874
You never cared about her
when she was alive.

00:39:16,874 --> 00:39:18,242
Why start now?

00:39:18,242 --> 00:39:20,978
We know what happens
when you lose your temper.

00:39:20,978 --> 00:39:22,713
Somebody ends up dead.

00:39:22,713 --> 00:39:24,314
Fred threatened
to call the cops

00:39:24,314 --> 00:39:28,185
about a financial dispute
we had ten years ago.

00:39:28,185 --> 00:39:30,087
Financial dispute?
Oh, you mean that's when you

00:39:30,087 --> 00:39:31,955
stole all the money
out of your business account

00:39:31,955 --> 00:39:33,991
and left Fred
with nothing?

00:39:33,991 --> 00:39:35,259
I didn't want to go to jail.

00:39:37,327 --> 00:39:39,063
Take your hands off of me.

00:39:45,202 --> 00:39:47,738
You come back to move the mummy
out of the wall,

00:39:47,738 --> 00:39:50,074
but you leave a fresh body
in the kitchen?

00:39:50,074 --> 00:39:52,609
I heard this big truck
pull up outside.

00:39:52,609 --> 00:39:54,278
And I had to get
out of there in a hurry.

00:39:54,278 --> 00:39:56,680
Yeah, that would be
the house stealers.

00:39:57,948 --> 00:39:59,216
It's... long story.

00:39:59,216 --> 00:40:00,350
You know, you're a very mean,

00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:02,686
angry man, Mr. Hicks.

00:40:02,686 --> 00:40:03,921
And anger's like a toxin.

00:40:03,921 --> 00:40:05,989
It poisons everything
it touches,

00:40:05,989 --> 00:40:09,726
especially your family
and also that house of yours.

00:40:09,726 --> 00:40:12,796
Prison is full of mean
and angry people, Walter.

00:40:12,796 --> 00:40:13,964
So you'll fit right in.

00:40:23,006 --> 00:40:24,174
You are not seriously
doing this!

00:40:24,174 --> 00:40:25,209
I'm going after him.
Hey! Hey!

00:40:25,209 --> 00:40:26,643
Yeah, that's gonna help.

00:40:26,643 --> 00:40:27,945
Do not do this.
Stuff is in there.

00:40:27,945 --> 00:40:29,780
What? You're gonna
lock our stuff in there?

00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:30,981
Oh, great, look at this.

00:40:30,981 --> 00:40:32,249
Jimmy? Seriously?
Look at this.

00:40:32,249 --> 00:40:33,650
You're so dumb.
...coming back.

00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:35,219
DEBBIE:
No...!

00:40:35,219 --> 00:40:37,254
Thank you for coming.
I didn't know who else to call.

00:40:37,254 --> 00:40:39,223
DWAYNE: You cannot change
the locks on this house!

00:40:39,223 --> 00:40:40,791
It's not your house,
dumb-ass!

00:40:40,791 --> 00:40:42,092
JIMMY:
Like you said, bro,

00:40:42,092 --> 00:40:43,961
possessing is nine-tenths
of the law.

00:40:43,961 --> 00:40:47,131
It's possession, you idiot.
DWAYNE: Thank you.

00:40:47,131 --> 00:40:48,966
Hey, arrest him, he's squatting.

00:40:48,966 --> 00:40:50,300
Hell, shoot him.
Yeah.

00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,902
No, no, no...
No one is shooting anyone.

00:40:51,902 --> 00:40:53,237
MARLA:
It is just a house.

00:40:53,237 --> 00:40:54,638
It's not worth
killing each other.

00:40:54,638 --> 00:40:55,906
Shut up, Marla.

00:40:55,906 --> 00:40:57,307
You're not even
our real sister anymore.

00:40:57,307 --> 00:40:58,775
Yeah, you're barely
family, okay?

00:40:58,775 --> 00:41:01,345
We have the same mother,
you idiots.

00:41:01,345 --> 00:41:03,280
DEBBIE: Hey, are you guys
gonna do anything?

00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,748
Do something.
What are you doing?

00:41:04,748 --> 00:41:06,917
We're gonna do something.
DWAYNE: Good.

00:41:06,917 --> 00:41:08,619
You are so dumb.

00:41:08,619 --> 00:41:10,220
Why are you still
doing that?
Get off my lawn.

00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:11,989
DWAYNE:
This is not your lawn.
It's the desert.

00:41:11,989 --> 00:41:13,690
JIMMY:
Get off my desert.
SIDLE: Finn?

00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:14,691
Finn, um...

00:41:14,691 --> 00:41:15,893
(chainsaw buzzes)

00:41:15,893 --> 00:41:17,861
(all the Hicks
shouting, "Whoa!")

00:41:17,861 --> 00:41:19,129
You each want a piece
of the house?

00:41:19,129 --> 00:41:20,130
Great. Let's divvy it up.

00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:21,598
What do you want?

00:41:21,598 --> 00:41:22,833
You want the living room
and the dining room?

00:41:22,833 --> 00:41:24,268
Yeah?
No!

00:41:24,268 --> 00:41:26,270
Would you like the bedroom
and the bathroom maybe?

00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:27,804
Hey, hey, hey!

00:41:27,804 --> 00:41:29,139
I'm just gonna chop it
right in half.

00:41:29,139 --> 00:41:30,307
You can't chop up our house.

00:41:30,307 --> 00:41:31,842
Okay. Is that good?

00:41:31,842 --> 00:41:34,211
(all the Hicks shouting "No!")

00:41:37,614 --> 00:41:40,584
Or, you know, there's
another way to settle this.

00:41:40,584 --> 00:41:43,086
This house caused
a lot of damage

00:41:43,086 --> 00:41:44,087
on the way up here.

00:41:44,087 --> 00:41:45,322
Over $100,000.

00:41:45,322 --> 00:41:48,325
Whoever owns the house
gets the bill.

00:41:48,325 --> 00:41:50,327
Wait... the house isn't
even worth that much.

00:41:50,327 --> 00:41:52,129
She stole it.

00:41:52,129 --> 00:41:53,263
Yeah, give her the bill.

00:41:53,263 --> 00:41:54,264
What?!

00:41:54,264 --> 00:41:56,867
I never even wanted this house.

00:42:02,773 --> 00:42:04,274
FINLAY:
<i>And then we told Marla</i>

00:42:04,274 --> 00:42:06,944
that she could donate the house
to a charity or the city,

00:42:06,944 --> 00:42:08,812
so she doesn't have
to pay the bill.

00:42:08,812 --> 00:42:10,280
Smart.

00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,182
It was actually Sara's idea.

00:42:12,182 --> 00:42:14,318
Probably didn't hurt
to have some crazy lady

00:42:14,318 --> 00:42:16,153
running around with a chainsaw.

00:42:16,153 --> 00:42:17,588
You heard?

00:42:17,588 --> 00:42:19,289
Yeah, I heard.

00:42:19,289 --> 00:42:21,925
A little too familiar.

00:42:24,027 --> 00:42:25,796
I don't get it.

00:42:25,796 --> 00:42:27,197
What's that?

00:42:27,197 --> 00:42:29,600
Well, I've been walking
around this place

00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:32,135
the last couple days,
trying to find the problem.

00:42:32,135 --> 00:42:34,071
This place is like a family.

00:42:34,071 --> 00:42:35,806
You've got the best of the best.

00:42:35,806 --> 00:42:36,974
That's true.

00:42:36,974 --> 00:42:41,612
So why... why'd you
bring me here?

00:42:41,612 --> 00:42:43,580
Best of the best
can always get better.

00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:46,717
Right?

00:42:46,717 --> 00:42:49,052
You know that's
only half an answer.

00:42:49,052 --> 00:42:51,688
Jules, let's not do this.

00:42:51,688 --> 00:42:54,825
I just don't want history
to repeat itself.

00:42:54,825 --> 00:42:56,727
Well, that makes two of us.
