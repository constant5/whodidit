00:00:02,084 --> 00:00:04,353
(rattling, squeaking)

00:00:04,353 --> 00:00:05,354
(lid thuds)

00:00:06,922 --> 00:00:10,226
(startled shout)

00:00:10,226 --> 00:00:12,828
(woman yelling)

00:00:12,828 --> 00:00:15,131
(grunts)

00:00:16,365 --> 00:00:19,301
(gasping)

00:00:19,301 --> 00:00:20,770
(anxious breathing)

00:00:22,705 --> 00:00:24,940
(woman whimpering)

00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:27,843
(whimpers, shudders)

00:00:27,843 --> 00:00:29,678
(screams)

00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:30,880
(crying)

00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,414
(screaming)

00:00:32,414 --> 00:00:35,317
(sirens wail,
indistinct radio communication)

00:00:39,121 --> 00:00:40,856
What are you looking at?

00:00:40,856 --> 00:00:42,258
The view.
Oh.

00:00:42,258 --> 00:00:44,293
Never seen the city from
this perspective before.

00:00:44,293 --> 00:00:45,661
It's beautiful.

00:00:45,661 --> 00:00:47,096
Takes your breath away.

00:00:47,096 --> 00:00:48,798
Yeah.
It can take more than that.

00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:50,132
We used to call this place

00:00:50,132 --> 00:00:52,001
the Missile Base.

00:00:52,001 --> 00:00:53,869
The Missile Base.
Uh-huh.

00:00:53,869 --> 00:00:55,271
Care to share why?

00:00:55,271 --> 00:00:57,339
Why did I bring that up? Oh!

00:00:57,339 --> 00:00:59,241
All right, I'll
tell you what.

00:00:59,241 --> 00:01:01,076
I'll make it easy for
you-- I'll go first.

00:01:01,076 --> 00:01:03,279
I met my wife freshman
year in college,

00:01:03,279 --> 00:01:05,414
and she was my
first and only love.

00:01:05,414 --> 00:01:07,183
Aw.

00:01:07,183 --> 00:01:08,884
Seriously?

00:01:08,884 --> 00:01:10,386
You lost your virginity
to your wife?

00:01:10,386 --> 00:01:12,188
Yep. Yep.

00:01:12,188 --> 00:01:14,089
Life is simple sometimes.

00:01:14,089 --> 00:01:17,026
You meet the right person,
and you know it's forever.

00:01:17,026 --> 00:01:19,361
And that was a boring story,
so it's your turn.

00:01:19,361 --> 00:01:20,963
Tony Anthopoulos.
I was 16.

00:01:20,963 --> 00:01:22,798
Too many beers,
too little romance.

00:01:22,798 --> 00:01:24,300
Seemed like a good idea
at the time.

00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,868
Ah, that's better.

00:01:25,868 --> 00:01:28,003
Swept away
by the passion of the moment.

00:01:28,003 --> 00:01:29,138
Something like that.

00:01:29,138 --> 00:01:30,906
Tony was a bad boy.

00:01:30,906 --> 00:01:32,241
First of many.

00:01:32,241 --> 00:01:35,411
I liked being wanted...
till that got old.

00:01:35,411 --> 00:01:37,279
Well, you're a
very smart woman.

00:01:37,279 --> 00:01:39,748
You probably just wanted to be
appreciated for that too.

00:01:39,748 --> 00:01:41,050
Yeah.

00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:42,751
Hey, David.

00:01:42,751 --> 00:01:44,820
Oh, hey.

00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,188
So, what are
we looking at here?

00:01:46,188 --> 00:01:48,324
I'm not sure yet.
Just got here myself.

00:01:48,324 --> 00:01:50,192
WILLOWS:
The tarp's pretty clean.

00:01:50,192 --> 00:01:52,328
Doesn't look like
it's been dragged or rolled.

00:01:52,328 --> 00:01:55,931
Looks more like it was
carried and placed here.

00:01:55,931 --> 00:01:57,967
WILLOWS:
We'll get it to Trace.

00:01:57,967 --> 00:02:00,135
Concrete and caliche.

00:02:00,135 --> 00:02:03,339
Not going to get
any foot impressions.

00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:17,319
Oh.

00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:20,389
RUSSELL: There's like
a dozen needles here.

00:02:20,389 --> 00:02:22,291
But there's no blood.

00:02:23,359 --> 00:02:25,661
(camera shutter clicks)

00:02:25,661 --> 00:02:27,229
You got your shots?

00:02:27,229 --> 00:02:28,163
Yeah.

00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,636
There's some expertise
demonstrated here.

00:02:33,636 --> 00:02:37,273
Those needles are thrust through
and through-- see that?

00:02:37,273 --> 00:02:41,844
Yeah. Right under the cornified
layers of the epidermis.

00:02:41,844 --> 00:02:45,247
Minimize the hemorrhaging,
maximize the pain.

00:02:45,247 --> 00:02:47,049
RUSSELL:
Well, this was not about

00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:49,084
killing her.

00:02:49,084 --> 00:02:51,220
It was about
watching her suffer.

(door opening)

00:03:39,068 --> 00:03:40,836
Morgan.

00:03:40,836 --> 00:03:43,172
I heard Russell cleared you
to come back.

00:03:43,172 --> 00:03:44,340
If you need more time...

00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,808
Oh, I'm good.

00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:47,376
I might put off
that helicopter tour

00:03:47,376 --> 00:03:49,378
of the Grand Canyon
for a while.

00:03:49,378 --> 00:03:51,180
Yeah, that'd probably be smart.

00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,283
Well, since you're here,
I could use a hand.

00:03:54,283 --> 00:03:56,251
Yeah, no problem.

00:04:09,264 --> 00:04:11,834
These are 20-gauge hypos.

00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:14,737
The kind used
in bone marrow transplants.

00:04:14,737 --> 00:04:17,272
Killer had access
to medical supplies.

00:04:17,272 --> 00:04:19,008
Needles are inserted

00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:21,643
approximately
three inches apart.

00:04:21,643 --> 00:04:25,080
Perpendicular,
in a line, wrist to wrist.

00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,349
You think
the pattern is significant?

00:04:27,349 --> 00:04:29,318
Seems ritualistic.

00:04:29,318 --> 00:04:31,653
But it's definitely
sadistic.
Yeah.

00:04:32,788 --> 00:04:34,056
Hold on.

00:04:35,357 --> 00:04:37,693
This isn't a hypo.

00:04:39,361 --> 00:04:41,063
(scoffs)

00:04:41,063 --> 00:04:42,831
Shish kabob skewer.

00:04:44,266 --> 00:04:47,369
It's a black residue.

00:04:48,771 --> 00:04:50,973
Looks like candle wax.

00:04:52,908 --> 00:04:54,777
The scarring--
it's all over her body.

00:04:54,777 --> 00:04:57,780
Consistent with the needles
and the skewer.

00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,648
You'd think
after all these years,

00:04:59,648 --> 00:05:02,384
I wouldn't be surprised
by what people are capable of.

00:05:04,686 --> 00:05:06,622
(light scratching in distance)

00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:13,228
Hodges?
(gasps)

00:05:13,228 --> 00:05:14,396
What are you doing?

00:05:14,396 --> 00:05:15,931
<i>Scusi.</i>

00:05:15,931 --> 00:05:17,299
Did Lorenzo interrupt
Michelangelo

00:05:17,299 --> 00:05:18,700
when he was creating?

00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,402
He didn't wrap bodies
in his canvas.

00:05:20,402 --> 00:05:21,770
And I thought you said

00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:23,172
you didn't find
any trace on this.

00:05:23,172 --> 00:05:24,940
Not trace.

00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,241
Something better.

00:05:26,241 --> 00:05:28,077
Art.

00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:29,945
Are you familiar
with a pentimento?

00:05:29,945 --> 00:05:32,014
What do you think?

00:05:32,014 --> 00:05:34,116
It's an alteration
in a painting.

00:05:34,116 --> 00:05:35,818
<i>When an artist makes a mistake</i>

00:05:35,818 --> 00:05:37,352
<i>or they want</i>
<i>to change something,</i>

00:05:37,352 --> 00:05:39,288
<i>they simply whitewash</i>
<i>over the error,</i>

00:05:39,288 --> 00:05:40,722
<i>and then begin again.</i>

00:05:40,722 --> 00:05:42,724
I don't want to
get too excited,

00:05:42,724 --> 00:05:45,661
but we may have a
lost treasure here.

00:05:45,661 --> 00:05:47,162
Maybe even a Rembrandt.

00:05:47,162 --> 00:05:49,698
Really? Uh...

00:05:49,698 --> 00:05:50,933
<i>scusi.</i>

00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:53,635
Hmm? Oh.

00:05:53,635 --> 00:05:55,370
<i>Prego.</i>

00:06:02,678 --> 00:06:04,146
Mm.

00:06:04,146 --> 00:06:05,714
I <i>am</i> getting excited.

00:06:05,714 --> 00:06:06,882
See?

00:06:06,882 --> 00:06:08,383
What I see is more layers.

00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:10,352
More paint, Leonardo.

00:06:10,352 --> 00:06:14,089
Maybe what's under here will
give us a clue to our killer.

00:06:14,089 --> 00:06:15,824
So stop your scratching.

00:06:15,824 --> 00:06:18,127
Canvas is mine now.

00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:20,696
Huh. (speaks Italian)

00:06:20,696 --> 00:06:23,365
Hey, you better hope I don't
find out what that means.

00:06:23,365 --> 00:06:25,868
I ran our Jane Doe information
through Missing Persons.

00:06:25,868 --> 00:06:27,703
Nothing.
Run it again.

00:06:27,703 --> 00:06:29,037
I did. I know.

00:06:29,037 --> 00:06:30,739
It doesn't make sense.

00:06:30,739 --> 00:06:32,341
The injuries, the
evidence all suggest

00:06:32,341 --> 00:06:34,409
that she was
abducted weeks ago.

00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:37,146
Somebody should have
missed her by now.

00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:38,747
Doctor.

00:06:38,747 --> 00:06:40,716
Hey.
Hey.

00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:52,995
So, C.O.D.?

00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:54,263
Don't know yet.

00:06:54,263 --> 00:06:56,231
I sent samples off
to Toxicology.

00:06:56,231 --> 00:06:58,333
We'll see what
Henry has to say.

00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:01,637
As you both observed,
the external scarring

00:07:01,637 --> 00:07:04,239
indicates a prolonged
period of abuse.

00:07:04,239 --> 00:07:05,874
However, I did find

00:07:05,874 --> 00:07:08,243
something unusual
about the injuries.

00:07:08,243 --> 00:07:10,412
Scar tissue in the wound tracts.

00:07:10,412 --> 00:07:12,781
It's as if the
needles and the skewer

00:07:12,781 --> 00:07:15,284
were inserted in the
same areas repeatedly.

00:07:15,284 --> 00:07:16,652
You mean like body piercing?

00:07:16,652 --> 00:07:18,287
Similar. In piercing,

00:07:18,287 --> 00:07:20,322
a needle's inserted
through the skin,

00:07:20,322 --> 00:07:23,325
<i>penetrating the various layers</i>
<i>of the epidermis.</i>

00:07:23,325 --> 00:07:28,730
<i>As scar tissue develops,</i>
<i>a permanent hole is created.</i>

00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:30,065
Difference in this case is,

00:07:30,065 --> 00:07:31,667
we're not talking
about piercings.

00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:33,669
RUSSELL:
No. No, we're not.

00:07:33,669 --> 00:07:36,672
We're talking about 20-gauge
needles and a barbecue skewer

00:07:36,672 --> 00:07:40,242
driven repeatedly
into this girl's flesh.

00:07:40,242 --> 00:07:42,110
That's what we're
talking about.

00:07:46,381 --> 00:07:48,150
What is this?
Is this a knee implant?

00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:49,751
Hers, I assume.

00:07:49,751 --> 00:07:52,754
She had unicompartmental
knee arthroplasty.

00:07:52,754 --> 00:07:55,123
Likely due to injury,
given the attenuation

00:07:55,123 --> 00:07:57,092
of her collateral
ligaments.
RUSSELL:
Whatever the case,

00:07:57,092 --> 00:07:59,962
we have a lot number, which will
give us an orthopedic surgeon.

00:07:59,962 --> 00:08:02,164
And a name for our...

00:08:02,164 --> 00:08:04,032
our Jane Doe.

00:08:09,037 --> 00:08:11,907
WOMAN: Renny was born
with an angular limb deformity

00:08:11,907 --> 00:08:14,676
in both rear legs,
which means that her back legs

00:08:14,676 --> 00:08:16,311
were growing faster
than her front legs.

00:08:16,311 --> 00:08:18,380
A horse foal my daughter Sylvia
is nursing has

00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,816
the same condition,
so, in order

00:08:20,816 --> 00:08:22,150
to help the bones grow,

00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,852
we performed
a brief surgical procedure

00:08:23,852 --> 00:08:25,721
called a peristeal
stripping. Now...

00:08:25,721 --> 00:08:27,356
Dr. Grier?
Yes?

00:08:27,356 --> 00:08:29,157
I'm Catherine Willows
with the Crime Lab.

00:08:29,157 --> 00:08:31,059
I need to speak with you.

00:08:31,059 --> 00:08:32,761
I'm sorry.
I'm in the middle of a seminar.

00:08:32,761 --> 00:08:34,329
It's about your sister Rachel.

00:08:37,232 --> 00:08:40,235
So, when was the last time
that you saw your sister?

00:08:40,235 --> 00:08:42,237
I haven't seen Rachel in years.

00:08:42,237 --> 00:08:43,872
She called me
a few months ago.

00:08:43,872 --> 00:08:46,675
Um, she had some medical bills,
needed money.

00:08:46,675 --> 00:08:49,378
Fort Lauderdale.
She had knee surgery.

00:08:49,378 --> 00:08:52,114
I just wired her the money.

00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:54,283
I stopped asking questions
a long time ago.

00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:55,617
What do you mean?

00:08:55,617 --> 00:08:56,752
My little sister was

00:08:58,754 --> 00:09:01,690
She ran away after high school.

00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:04,626
She broke my mother's heart.

00:09:04,626 --> 00:09:07,963

Rachel couldn't even be bothered
to come to her funeral.

00:09:09,698 --> 00:09:11,700
You say that she met
with violence.

00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,335

What happened?

I'm sorry;
I can't discuss the specifics.

00:09:15,404 --> 00:09:18,407
What I can tell you is
that we found her here in Vegas,

00:09:18,407 --> 00:09:20,175
and we suspect

00:09:20,175 --> 00:09:22,277
that she was taken
against her will, probably

00:09:22,277 --> 00:09:23,845
several weeks ago.

00:09:23,845 --> 00:09:26,014
That's impossible.

Excuse me, Sylvia,

three days ago?

00:09:35,624 --> 00:09:38,126
Yeah. I mean, she called,
and she said

00:09:38,126 --> 00:09:40,395
that she was in town
and needed to talk.

00:09:40,395 --> 00:09:42,331
Made me promise not
to say anything.

00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:44,132
Why?

00:09:44,132 --> 00:09:48,103
My mom and Aunt Rachel
don't really talk.

00:09:48,103 --> 00:09:49,838

wanted things

00:09:49,838 --> 00:09:52,341

she wanted to fix things.

00:19:40,962 --> 00:19:42,263
(clears throat)

00:19:42,263 --> 00:19:43,765
Ah...

00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:45,833
Empress of pain <i>and</i> pleasure.

00:19:48,369 --> 00:19:50,171
You mind?

00:19:51,906 --> 00:19:53,908
Thought you were a coffee snob.

00:19:53,908 --> 00:19:55,276
Machine in my office
is broken.

00:19:55,276 --> 00:19:57,211
I'm waiting
for parts.

00:19:59,314 --> 00:20:02,650
(sniffs)
Mm.

00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:04,619
A little light
reading, I see.

00:20:04,619 --> 00:20:07,255
Satisfying
my curiosity.

00:20:07,255 --> 00:20:10,959
So Nick and I found
a whole pharmacy

00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:12,360
in Rachel Grier's tent,

00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,062
including
lidocaine.

00:20:14,062 --> 00:20:15,797
Henry is sourcing
the stuff for me.

00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:18,933
Also running
an expanded tox panel.

00:20:18,933 --> 00:20:20,735
Maybe one of the other drugs
killed her.

00:20:20,735 --> 00:20:23,104
Here, we thought some sick
bastard tortured the girl.

00:20:23,104 --> 00:20:24,806
Maybe she OD'd.

00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:26,708
Nah, you know, I don't
think so, actually.

00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:28,977
I mean, she certainly wouldn't
have wrapped up her own body

00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:31,045
and dumped it.
No.

00:20:31,045 --> 00:20:33,348
You know, there's something
about this Major Willie.

00:20:33,348 --> 00:20:36,217
He reminds me of...

00:20:36,217 --> 00:20:39,220
I told you about my parents
being singers, right?

00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,222
Yeah.
Performers, really.

00:20:41,222 --> 00:20:45,193
When I was a kid, they were
part of this traveling show.

00:20:45,193 --> 00:20:48,096
We went around the country
in our van.

00:20:48,096 --> 00:20:51,366
Anyway, the leader
of this group was a,

00:20:51,366 --> 00:20:54,869
a guy who called himself
Durga Joe.

00:20:54,869 --> 00:20:56,938
He was a real
charismatic,

00:20:56,938 --> 00:20:59,107
kind of like
this Willie guy.

00:20:59,107 --> 00:21:01,642
He could make people...

00:21:01,642 --> 00:21:05,046
he could make people do pretty
much anything he wanted.

00:21:05,046 --> 00:21:06,948
That was the problem,
at least for my parents,

00:21:06,948 --> 00:21:08,950
so, one day they
decided they wanted

00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:13,054
to leave and Durga Joe
did not like that at all.

00:21:13,054 --> 00:21:14,222
What happened?

00:21:14,222 --> 00:21:15,857
In the middle
of the night,

00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:18,126
we got in our van
and we just took off.

00:21:18,126 --> 00:21:20,628
And never really...
looked back.

00:21:20,628 --> 00:21:24,365
Anyway... the point is
that this Rachel Grier,

00:21:24,365 --> 00:21:26,701
she wanted to leave,
too, you know?

00:21:26,701 --> 00:21:28,636
She wanted to go home.

00:21:28,636 --> 00:21:30,738
Maybe this is about control.

00:21:30,738 --> 00:21:33,074
Major Willie's
Rambling Carnival--

00:21:33,074 --> 00:21:34,809
one big, happy family.

00:21:34,809 --> 00:21:36,744
Until somebody wants to leave.

00:21:36,744 --> 00:21:38,946
Got your new
and <i>improved</i> tox panel.

00:21:38,946 --> 00:21:40,882
I know what killed
Rachel Grier

00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:42,316
and maybe who.

00:21:44,252 --> 00:21:48,089
STOKES: Major Willie-- aka
Steven Watt of Tampa, Florida.

00:21:48,089 --> 00:21:50,758
You know, without
the Willy Wonka get-up,

00:21:50,758 --> 00:21:53,094
you could pass for
just another freak.

00:21:53,094 --> 00:21:54,929
The word is "geek,"

00:21:54,929 --> 00:21:57,298
as in someone who
can perform freakish acts

00:21:57,298 --> 00:22:00,034
without actually themselves
being a freak of nature.

00:22:00,034 --> 00:22:01,302
I'll take your word for it.

00:22:01,302 --> 00:22:03,337
And I will
take that.

00:22:03,337 --> 00:22:05,673
Oh, look.

00:22:05,673 --> 00:22:07,909
What's he going to do?

00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:17,351
Yeah, and if you
think that's freaky...

00:22:26,761 --> 00:22:28,262
(splutters)
Don't worry,

00:22:28,262 --> 00:22:31,165
I'll regurgitate
it later.

00:22:31,165 --> 00:22:34,102
Wow. We gotta learn
how to do that.

00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:37,138
So, uh...

00:22:37,138 --> 00:22:40,308
we know what killed Rachel--
propofol.

00:22:40,308 --> 00:22:43,244
Which is used
in anesthesia,

00:22:43,244 --> 00:22:46,347
but in high enough doses
and without a ventilator,

00:22:46,347 --> 00:22:48,116
it paralyzes the diaphragm.

00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:50,084
So basically...

00:22:50,084 --> 00:22:53,187
Rachel... suffocated to death.

00:22:53,187 --> 00:22:55,890
STOKES: You're licensed in
Florida <i>and</i> New York

00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:57,959
to practice body piercings
and modifications.

00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:00,161
That's how you were able
to obtain the pharmaceuticals

00:23:00,161 --> 00:23:02,830
we found in Rachel's tent.

00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:04,966
You people just don't get it.

00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:06,667
We don't get what?

00:23:06,667 --> 00:23:08,870
Freaks versus geeks.

00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:10,805
A guy like Zodiac,

00:23:10,805 --> 00:23:12,006
he has congenital
analgesia.

00:23:12,006 --> 00:23:13,107
He was born

00:23:13,107 --> 00:23:15,109
not feeling pain-- a freak.

00:23:15,109 --> 00:23:16,777
Rachel and me,

00:23:16,777 --> 00:23:18,813
we need...

00:23:18,813 --> 00:23:20,348
needed help.

00:23:20,348 --> 00:23:22,416
A little pharmacology.

00:23:22,416 --> 00:23:25,319
<i>Stuff like lidocaine,</i>
<i>to take the edge off the pain,</i>

00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:27,955
<i>to enhance performance.</i>

00:23:32,059 --> 00:23:35,163
<i>No drugs, no show,</i>

00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:36,931
<i>no dough.</i>

00:23:36,931 --> 00:23:39,667
I won't lie-- maybe at
the end of the evening

00:23:39,667 --> 00:23:41,769
we all like to indulge
in a little...

00:23:41,769 --> 00:23:43,971
something something...

00:23:43,971 --> 00:23:46,307
to ease an old carney's burden.

00:23:46,307 --> 00:23:48,342
But straight up...

00:23:48,342 --> 00:23:50,211
I am a businessman;
I look after

00:23:50,211 --> 00:23:52,213
my people,
I take care of them.

00:23:52,213 --> 00:23:55,383
And Rachel, she was an earner.

00:23:55,383 --> 00:23:59,387
Who wanted to stop earning,
I believe.

00:23:59,387 --> 00:24:01,756
She would never have left me.

00:24:06,093 --> 00:24:10,231
You didn't find any propofol
in Rachel's tent, did you?

00:24:10,231 --> 00:24:11,866
No.

00:24:11,866 --> 00:24:13,801
Am I under arrest?

00:24:13,801 --> 00:24:15,169
Not yet, no.

00:24:15,169 --> 00:24:18,706
But this, uh, this is
just our opening act.

00:24:18,706 --> 00:24:20,741
Here. One for the road.

00:24:22,343 --> 00:24:24,178
BRODY:
<i>Got the DNA results</i>

00:24:24,178 --> 00:24:26,747
from Rachel Grier's tent--
the blood Russell found

00:24:26,747 --> 00:24:28,349
in the fridge is
a match to Rachel.

00:24:28,349 --> 00:24:30,284
Also the torture chair.
Well, it makes sense.

00:24:30,284 --> 00:24:32,720
Rachel was storing her
blood to use in her act.

00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,089
Yeah, well, the blood also
tells us another story--

00:24:35,089 --> 00:24:37,792
hormone levels suggest that
Rachel was pregnant.

00:24:37,792 --> 00:24:42,163
Labels on the pack say as
recently as two weeks ago.

00:24:42,163 --> 00:24:44,265
There was no evidence
in autopsy.

00:24:44,265 --> 00:24:46,167
Not just that.

00:24:46,167 --> 00:24:51,272
Nick found traces of blood
and semen in Rachel's bed.

00:24:51,272 --> 00:24:53,207
Single donor.

00:24:53,207 --> 00:24:54,809
No hits in CODIS.

00:24:54,809 --> 00:24:58,346
"Profile is a male Caucasian
suffering from

00:24:58,346 --> 00:25:02,183
neurofibromatosis
type-1 and Proteus Syndrome."

00:25:03,951 --> 00:25:05,753
Rachel was sleeping
with the Elephant Man?

00:25:22,336 --> 00:25:25,072
So, last heir to
the House of Merrick.

00:25:25,072 --> 00:25:26,874
That's a good story.

00:25:26,874 --> 00:25:29,944
I saw the movie, too--
it was... I liked it.

00:25:29,944 --> 00:25:33,414
But truth is, there
is... no house, right?

00:25:33,414 --> 00:25:36,317
Because the Elephant Man
didn't have any children.

00:25:36,317 --> 00:25:40,154
So your name's not
really Merrick, is it?

00:25:40,154 --> 00:25:42,323
No.
My name is Joshua Helm.

00:25:42,323 --> 00:25:43,958
And, Joshua,

00:25:43,958 --> 00:25:45,793
you don't have any children,
either, do you?

00:25:45,793 --> 00:25:48,863
No.
Rachel Grier made
sure of that.

00:25:48,863 --> 00:25:50,998
She got rid of the baby.

00:25:50,998 --> 00:25:53,367
Just like she wanted
to get rid of you.

00:25:53,367 --> 00:25:55,036
You don't know
what you're saying.

00:25:55,036 --> 00:25:57,238
Rachel and I were in love.

00:25:57,238 --> 00:26:01,409
Is that why she was making
plans to leave the show?
Yes.

00:26:01,409 --> 00:26:04,111
I told her she was crazy,
that we couldn't have

00:26:04,111 --> 00:26:06,113
a normal life
on the outside.

00:26:06,113 --> 00:26:08,149
Wait-wait-wait a minute.
So you're saying

00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:10,918
that the two of you were
planning on going away together?

00:26:10,918 --> 00:26:12,820
That's what she wanted.

00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:15,823
You could survive
on the outside,
but I can't.

00:26:15,823 --> 00:26:17,725
You can with me.

00:26:17,725 --> 00:26:20,227
I love you, Joshua--
that's all that matters.

00:26:20,227 --> 00:26:22,763
Rachel had lost the child,

00:26:22,763 --> 00:26:24,699
and she wanted to try again.

00:26:24,699 --> 00:26:26,200
I said no.

00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,003
I told her she could
leave if she wanted to,

00:26:29,003 --> 00:26:30,871
but that I wasn't
going with her.

00:26:30,871 --> 00:26:32,373
Rachel was always naive,

00:26:32,373 --> 00:26:34,342
living in a fantasy land.

00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:37,178
You do tell a good story.

00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:47,088
Is that what you
think this is?

00:26:47,088 --> 00:26:48,856
I've already
seen the show,

00:26:48,856 --> 00:26:51,859
and I'm familiar
with the story.

00:26:51,859 --> 00:26:55,363
Girl hates her life,
is searching for something,

00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:57,131
thinks she finds it
in a man,

00:26:57,131 --> 00:27:01,168
a man who needs her,
and then...

00:27:01,168 --> 00:27:03,304
it all goes wrong.

00:27:03,304 --> 00:27:07,074
You killed her because
she wanted her life back.

00:27:07,074 --> 00:27:10,945
Look... I don't know what
happened to Rachel,

00:27:10,945 --> 00:27:14,648
and if you're trying to
provoke me, it's not working.

00:27:15,783 --> 00:27:17,385
You can't

00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:21,756
imagine how the love that
we had for each other existed,

00:27:21,756 --> 00:27:24,392
because you've never known it.

00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:26,327
And you never will.

00:27:29,797 --> 00:27:31,799
SANDERS:
<i>So, we turned</i>
<i>Major Willie's Carnival</i>

00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:33,734
upside down, didn't
find any propofol.

00:27:33,734 --> 00:27:35,903
We have any record of
him buying the stuff?

00:27:35,903 --> 00:27:38,339
No, we have nothing to tie him
to the drugs that killed Rachel,

00:27:38,339 --> 00:27:41,075
(phone rings)
and Brass just cut him loose.

00:27:41,075 --> 00:27:42,309
Stokes.

00:27:42,309 --> 00:27:44,678
Yeah.

00:27:44,678 --> 00:27:46,747
You kidding me?

00:27:46,747 --> 00:27:49,049
Greg'll be interested to
hear that. Thanks, Jimbo.

00:27:49,049 --> 00:27:50,885
Well, it looks like

00:27:50,885 --> 00:27:53,854
we're gonna have to cut
Major Willie loose again.

00:28:00,227 --> 00:28:01,762
Well...

00:28:01,762 --> 00:28:03,364
rigor hasn't set in.

00:28:03,364 --> 00:28:06,066
T.O.D.'s less
than two hours ago.

00:28:06,066 --> 00:28:08,235
STOKES:
No vital response.

00:28:08,235 --> 00:28:10,771
He was dead before
he was hanged.

00:28:10,771 --> 00:28:12,106
Staged.

00:28:12,106 --> 00:28:13,741
Yeah, poorly.

00:28:13,741 --> 00:28:16,010
Okay, cut him down,
get him to Autopsy.

00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:17,878
Let's find out what
really killed him.

00:28:17,878 --> 00:28:19,213
CSI Stokes?

00:28:19,213 --> 00:28:22,783
Yeah.
We've got a suspect
in custody.

00:28:25,619 --> 00:28:27,354
OFFICER:
You need to stay back, okay?

00:28:27,354 --> 00:28:29,623
Which one
of the freaks is it?

00:28:29,623 --> 00:28:31,125
There.

00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,996
Suspect's name
is Sylvia Grier.

00:28:35,996 --> 00:28:38,365
STOKES:
Rachel Grier's niece?

00:28:42,636 --> 00:28:44,738
(blipping)

00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:05,893
WOMAN:
<i>This is insane.</i>

00:29:05,893 --> 00:29:07,962
Dr. Grier, your daughter
was detained

00:29:07,962 --> 00:29:10,664
while fleeing the scene
of an apparent homicide.

00:29:10,664 --> 00:29:14,201
I... I don't know what Sylvia
was doing at that freak show,

00:29:14,201 --> 00:29:17,204
but... but I do know that
she would never hurt anyone.

00:29:17,204 --> 00:29:19,039
Well, then neither
you nor Sylvia

00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:20,941
has anything to
be afraid of.

00:29:22,309 --> 00:29:24,678
What were you doing
there, Sylvia?

00:29:24,678 --> 00:29:28,782
I went there because I
needed to see for myself.

00:29:28,782 --> 00:29:30,351
See what?

00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:33,354
S--see who my
aunt really was.

00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:35,990
I found the story online,

00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:38,192
"Sideshow Performer Murdered,"

00:29:38,192 --> 00:29:40,060
and it was Aunt Rachel.

00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,395
To my mom,

00:29:41,395 --> 00:29:45,666
Aunt Rachel was a ghost, but...

00:29:45,666 --> 00:29:48,802
to me, she was like this...

00:29:48,802 --> 00:29:50,971
force of nature.

00:29:50,971 --> 00:29:53,173
You know?
She did what she wanted to do

00:29:53,173 --> 00:29:54,842
and lived how
she wanted to live,

00:29:54,842 --> 00:29:57,645
and I just felt this...

00:29:57,645 --> 00:29:59,380
connection.

00:30:01,649 --> 00:30:04,818
I mean, is that weird?

00:30:04,818 --> 00:30:06,754
Look, I didn't kill

00:30:06,754 --> 00:30:08,622
that man.

00:30:08,622 --> 00:30:10,724
Why don't you tell me
what happened?

00:30:10,724 --> 00:30:13,661
I went looking for where
Aunt Rachel had been living,

00:30:13,661 --> 00:30:15,329
and I got lost.

00:30:15,329 --> 00:30:17,197
And I wandered
into that tent,

00:30:17,197 --> 00:30:18,899
and that's when I saw him.

00:30:21,302 --> 00:30:24,038
<i>I was so scared.</i>

00:30:24,038 --> 00:30:27,341
<i>And then, they were</i>
<i>all staring at me.</i>

00:30:27,341 --> 00:30:30,644
<i>I mean, they thought I did it.</i>

00:30:30,644 --> 00:30:32,646
<i>So I ran.</i>

00:30:32,646 --> 00:30:34,949
And I hid,
but the officers found me.

00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:38,319
I didn't do anything.

00:30:40,821 --> 00:30:42,957
RUSSELL:
<i>Do you believe her?</i>

00:30:42,957 --> 00:30:44,625
Sylvia? Yes.

00:30:44,625 --> 00:30:46,927
Well, I don't know
what to believe anymore.

00:30:46,927 --> 00:30:49,630
I think I made a mistake
about Major Willie.

00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:52,066
I think I let my past
cloud my thinking.

00:30:52,066 --> 00:30:53,834
Well, we're all
guilty of that.

00:30:53,834 --> 00:30:55,769
Whoa, what do you mean?

00:30:55,769 --> 00:30:58,072
You're not having doubts about
our Elephant Man, are you?

00:30:58,072 --> 00:31:00,674
No. No.

00:31:00,674 --> 00:31:02,743
I mean, I don't like
being called out

00:31:02,743 --> 00:31:04,912
(laughs): about
my lack of romance,

00:31:04,912 --> 00:31:07,681
but it's no argument
for innocence.

00:31:07,681 --> 00:31:09,650
You still think
Elephant Man

00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:11,385
had motive to kill Rachel?

00:31:11,385 --> 00:31:14,388
Yes. Yes, and I think
Sylvia was sincere

00:31:14,388 --> 00:31:17,124
about feeling a connection
towards her aunt,

00:31:17,124 --> 00:31:18,659
which says to me

00:31:18,659 --> 00:31:20,694
that she wouldn't
do her any harm.

00:31:20,694 --> 00:31:25,065
Okay. But that doesn't mean that
she wouldn't go after the man

00:31:25,065 --> 00:31:26,367
who she believed did.

00:31:26,367 --> 00:31:27,968
Major Willie?

00:31:27,968 --> 00:31:29,903
But why would she suspect
that he killed Rachel?

00:31:29,903 --> 00:31:32,172
We're not even
convinced ourselves.

00:31:32,172 --> 00:31:34,775
Maybe somebody whispered
Willie's name in her ear.

00:31:34,775 --> 00:31:36,377
Maybe our real killer.

00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:44,685
Okay.

00:31:44,685 --> 00:31:46,720
What have we got here, boys?

00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,288
Well, your carnival
barker's C.O.D.

00:31:48,288 --> 00:31:50,157
was massive internal
hemorrhaging

00:31:50,157 --> 00:31:52,693
due to an inch-and-a-half
laceration and perforation

00:31:52,693 --> 00:31:54,228
of the stomach wall,

00:31:54,228 --> 00:31:56,397
severing the left
gastro-omental artery.

00:31:56,397 --> 00:31:58,799
Check it out.

00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:01,335
Stomach wall's punctured
from the inside out.

00:32:01,335 --> 00:32:05,239
That's bigger than a paper clip.

00:32:05,239 --> 00:32:07,007
I found no injuries
to the pharynx

00:32:07,007 --> 00:32:08,375
or esophagus.

00:32:08,375 --> 00:32:10,144
So, it's not like somebody

00:32:10,144 --> 00:32:12,012
shoved something
down his throat.

00:32:12,012 --> 00:32:13,147
No, no.

00:32:13,147 --> 00:32:15,282
Guy swallowed a sword.

00:32:15,282 --> 00:32:16,950
Check that out.

00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:18,619
SANDERS:
Well, that would do it.

00:32:18,619 --> 00:32:21,855
Actually, our friend here
swallowed lots of things.

00:32:21,855 --> 00:32:23,157
Bon appétit, gentlemen.

00:32:25,059 --> 00:32:27,628
♪ ♪

00:32:51,051 --> 00:32:52,753
Good thing for us,

00:32:52,753 --> 00:32:54,621
Major Willie bit off
more than he could chew.

00:32:55,789 --> 00:32:57,391
Gemini.

00:32:57,391 --> 00:33:00,127
Sign of the Zodiac.

00:33:00,127 --> 00:33:02,696
Take your shirt off.

00:33:02,696 --> 00:33:06,867
You want to play,
you got to pay.

00:33:06,867 --> 00:33:08,702
Oh, I got my ticket
right here, Muscles.

00:33:08,702 --> 00:33:10,704
It's called a search warrant.

00:33:10,704 --> 00:33:12,740
Now, take it off.

00:33:25,252 --> 00:33:26,954
If you want a picture with me,

00:33:26,954 --> 00:33:28,856
your friend right there
I'm sure will take it.

00:33:28,856 --> 00:33:30,691
No, that's all right. I'll pass.

00:33:30,691 --> 00:33:32,126
We're done here.

00:33:32,126 --> 00:33:35,062
Check him for warrants
while you're at it.

00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:40,667
Catherine, it's Nick.

00:33:40,667 --> 00:33:42,169
No go on Zodiac.

00:33:42,169 --> 00:33:44,037
We're gonna need
a pile of warrants.

00:33:44,037 --> 00:33:46,140
We're gonna need to bring
the whole freak show down here.

00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:12,733
I need to see
your chest, too.

00:34:14,067 --> 00:34:16,804
You want some help?

00:34:24,678 --> 00:34:26,780
Remove the bandage.

00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:28,081
(groans)

00:34:30,918 --> 00:34:32,753
Dog bite.

00:34:32,753 --> 00:34:35,823
I hope you had
all your shots.

00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:38,325
Sergio the Strong.

00:34:38,325 --> 00:34:40,327
Where do you people
come up with the stage names?

00:34:40,327 --> 00:34:42,196
I mean, I get it, I do.

00:34:42,196 --> 00:34:46,066
Because "Seth the Strong"
doesn't look good on a poster.

00:34:46,066 --> 00:34:48,869
But "Seth
Soon-To-Be-Convicted"--

00:34:48,869 --> 00:34:50,304
that has a
ring to it.

00:34:50,304 --> 00:34:53,006
We got back the DNA profile
on your ounce of flesh.

00:34:53,006 --> 00:34:57,711
Looks like you and the Elephant
Man were fraternal twins.

00:34:57,711 --> 00:35:00,147
I got to admit,
I didn't see that coming.

00:35:00,147 --> 00:35:03,684
And let me guess, mom
always liked you best.

00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:06,820
We know Rachel broke
your brother's heart.

00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:08,255
You made her pay for that.

00:35:08,255 --> 00:35:10,057
And then when Willie found out
what you did,

00:35:10,057 --> 00:35:11,758
you shut him up, too.
Is that about right?

00:35:13,894 --> 00:35:17,764
Our mom
died during childbirth.

00:35:17,764 --> 00:35:19,867
Dad dumped us
before we could walk.

00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:23,704
And when Joshua
started to... change,

00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:26,073
the relatives we were
staying with got freaked out.

00:35:26,073 --> 00:35:29,943
Said that Joshua and me
were born of the devil.

00:35:29,943 --> 00:35:32,946
For my brother, there was only
one path to salvation.

00:35:32,946 --> 00:35:37,718
Major Willie's Rambling Carnival
and Curious Extravaganza.

00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:41,154
Willie was no saint,
but he was better than most.

00:35:41,154 --> 00:35:43,257
He didn't treat
my brother

00:35:43,257 --> 00:35:44,391
like a monster.

00:35:44,391 --> 00:35:46,960
He was... he was good to him.

00:35:48,996 --> 00:35:50,197
Until...

00:35:50,197 --> 00:35:51,865
Until what?

00:35:55,969 --> 00:35:57,971
What the hell happened?

00:35:57,971 --> 00:35:59,306
I don't know.

00:35:59,306 --> 00:36:01,174
I just found her like this.

00:36:01,174 --> 00:36:03,176
Maybe she OD'd or something.

00:36:03,176 --> 00:36:04,711
You call the cops?

00:36:04,711 --> 00:36:06,046
You crazy?

00:36:06,046 --> 00:36:07,381
They'll close us down.

00:36:07,381 --> 00:36:08,916
You got to help me, Seth.

00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:10,951
We need to make this go away.

00:36:10,951 --> 00:36:13,353
Think about your brother.

00:36:13,353 --> 00:36:14,788
No show.

00:36:14,788 --> 00:36:16,857
Where does that leave him?

00:36:19,293 --> 00:36:21,828
SERGIO:
<i>So I did what he asked me.</i>

00:36:33,006 --> 00:36:35,842
<i>I made it all go away.</i>

00:36:35,842 --> 00:36:37,711
But it didn't go away.

00:36:37,711 --> 00:36:40,180
And we all know that
Rachel didn't just OD.

00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:42,182
You people found out
what was going on

00:36:42,182 --> 00:36:44,318
between Joshua and Rachel.

00:36:44,318 --> 00:36:47,287
You hauled him in here,
you questioned him.

00:36:47,287 --> 00:36:48,755
But he didn't do it.

00:36:48,755 --> 00:36:50,090
How do you know that?

00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:51,992
'Cause I know who did.

00:36:51,992 --> 00:36:53,994
Cops picked up Joshua.

00:36:53,994 --> 00:36:55,329
Don't sweat it.

00:36:55,329 --> 00:36:56,897
That's just what they do.

00:36:56,897 --> 00:36:58,966
Josh will be fine.

00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:01,969
Best thing you can do
is to keep your mouth shut.

00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:03,403
Trust me.

00:37:07,874 --> 00:37:09,977
Not this time.

00:37:15,916 --> 00:37:19,152
(grunting)

00:37:24,024 --> 00:37:26,660
(both grunting)

00:37:29,396 --> 00:37:31,865
(screams)

00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:36,303
I didn't mean to kill him.

00:37:36,303 --> 00:37:38,138
I thought that if
I made it look like

00:37:38,138 --> 00:37:42,409
he killed himself, that it all
would really go away.

00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:46,880
You don't believe
me, do you?

00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,216
We believe the evidence.

00:37:50,817 --> 00:37:53,620
(grunting forcefully)

00:38:02,896 --> 00:38:05,132
There's your evidence.

00:38:05,132 --> 00:38:07,768
Willie killed Rachel.

00:38:18,812 --> 00:38:21,415
Heard the suspect coughed
up the smoking gun.

00:38:21,415 --> 00:38:24,084
Yeah.

00:38:24,084 --> 00:38:26,019
What, did Nick leave you
to do the dirty work?

00:38:26,019 --> 00:38:28,655
No. Actually, I wanted
to run this myself.

00:38:28,655 --> 00:38:30,357
So, Sergio found

00:38:30,357 --> 00:38:32,959
the propofol when he was
cleaning up Rachel's tent?

00:38:32,959 --> 00:38:34,828
Yeah, he had doubts
about Willie,

00:38:34,828 --> 00:38:36,997
so he decided
to hang on to this.

00:38:36,997 --> 00:38:38,365
In his stomach?

00:38:38,365 --> 00:38:40,667
Better than
a safety deposit box, I guess.

00:38:40,667 --> 00:38:42,002
Little messier.

00:38:42,002 --> 00:38:44,337
So the propofol
belonged to Willie?

00:38:44,337 --> 00:38:46,206
That's what Sergio thinks.

00:38:46,206 --> 00:38:47,841
I'm not so sure.

00:38:47,841 --> 00:38:49,409
Why not?

00:38:49,409 --> 00:38:51,778
Willie was the resident
Dr. Feel Good.

00:38:51,778 --> 00:38:53,947
Well, if we're to believe
Sergio's story,

00:38:53,947 --> 00:38:56,950
Willie talked him into
dumping a body for him.

00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:58,652
I mean, come on.

00:38:58,652 --> 00:39:00,687
Guys like Willie are
the consummate con artists.

00:39:00,687 --> 00:39:02,756
They're, like,
the best salesmen in the world.

00:39:02,756 --> 00:39:05,625
So my question is: if he was
worried about losing Rachel,

00:39:05,625 --> 00:39:07,394
why wouldn't he just
talk her out of it?

00:39:07,394 --> 00:39:09,729
If he could talk her out of it,

00:39:09,729 --> 00:39:11,298
there'd be no reason
to kill her.

00:39:11,298 --> 00:39:12,833
Right.

00:39:12,833 --> 00:39:14,334
So back to the
Elephant Man?

00:39:14,334 --> 00:39:17,871
(computer beeping)

00:39:17,871 --> 00:39:20,707
Nope.

00:39:20,707 --> 00:39:23,176
WILLOWS:
We traced the drug that
killed your sister Rachel

00:39:23,176 --> 00:39:25,812
to the Clark
County Zoo.

00:39:25,812 --> 00:39:27,114
To you.

00:39:28,849 --> 00:39:30,283
Why?

00:39:31,918 --> 00:39:36,756
My daughter always
worshipped Rachel.

00:39:36,756 --> 00:39:40,093
Even though she was
barely a part of our lives.

00:39:40,093 --> 00:39:44,831
To Sylvia,
Rachel was this adventurer,

00:39:44,831 --> 00:39:47,000
this nonconformist,

00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,169
a free spirit--

00:39:49,169 --> 00:39:51,037
everything I wasn't,

00:39:51,037 --> 00:39:54,407
everything I wasn't
allowing Sylvia to be.

00:39:56,243 --> 00:39:58,712
Rachel was just a fantasy.

00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,816
Until she wasn't.

00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:05,785
She wanted to come back
into our lives.

00:40:05,785 --> 00:40:12,759
To insert her twisted self
into our home.

00:40:12,759 --> 00:40:17,063
Sh--she was having sex
with that... that thing.

00:40:17,063 --> 00:40:19,266
What kind of
a sick person

00:40:19,266 --> 00:40:21,801
would do that?

00:40:21,801 --> 00:40:23,136
She was your sister.

00:40:23,136 --> 00:40:27,174
No... she wasn't.

00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:31,178
She was... she was a freak.

00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:37,150
<i>I told her there was no place</i>
<i>in our home for her.</i>

00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:39,152
<i>But she wouldn't listen.</i>

00:40:39,152 --> 00:40:42,656
<i>She tried to go through Sylvia</i>
<i>to get to me.</i>

00:40:42,656 --> 00:40:45,392
<i>She used her.</i>

00:40:45,392 --> 00:40:47,294
<i>My own daughter.</i>

00:40:47,294 --> 00:40:51,665
<i>Who always loved my sister</i>
<i>more than she loved me.</i>

00:40:51,665 --> 00:40:53,833
My sister left me no choice.

00:40:53,833 --> 00:40:56,303
And you left her to suffocate.

00:40:56,303 --> 00:40:59,039
I did what I had to do.

00:41:00,941 --> 00:41:03,743
<i>I protected my daughter.</i>

00:41:07,681 --> 00:41:09,683
<i>You don't understand.</i>

00:41:09,683 --> 00:41:11,918
<i>She's the only family I have.</i>

00:41:14,688 --> 00:41:18,291
<i>I would've done anything...</i>
<i>anything to protect her.</i>

00:41:22,629 --> 00:41:25,699
<i>Sylvia's safe now.</i>

00:41:25,699 --> 00:41:29,636
She's safe from the monsters
in this world.

00:41:29,636 --> 00:41:33,073
Yes, she is.
