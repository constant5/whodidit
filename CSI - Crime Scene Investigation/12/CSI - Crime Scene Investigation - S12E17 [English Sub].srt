Yo, Gossip Girl!
Slow down!

00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:33,435
Who'd you piss off now?
Not now, Jake.

00:00:33,435 --> 00:00:35,404
Well, if you're looking for
our girlfriend, okay,

00:00:35,404 --> 00:00:36,538
you just missed her.

00:00:37,706 --> 00:00:39,941

00:00:48,383 --> 00:00:49,751
Aren't you Brooke Cassidy?

00:00:49,751 --> 00:00:51,319
That's me.

00:00:52,654 --> 00:00:53,955
So, you really a virgin?

00:00:57,759 --> 00:00:59,394
You forgot your number.

00:00:59,394 --> 00:01:00,796

Come on!
Drink, drink!

00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,430

Uh, you find your
little, uh, BFF?

00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:47,776
Oh, let it go.

00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:49,811

00:01:58,353 --> 00:02:00,255
I'm sorry, I left my
purity ring in my room.

00:02:00,255 --> 00:02:01,490
You want to come help
me look for it?

BRASS:
So,

00:03:05,453 --> 00:03:08,456
a series of 911 calls came in
just after 4:00 a.m.

00:03:08,456 --> 00:03:09,658
Dead body.

00:03:09,658 --> 00:03:11,760
An anonymous tip
gave us the location.

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,329
Who invited the campus?
I know, they keep coming.

00:03:14,329 --> 00:03:15,697
It's like moths to a flame.

00:03:15,697 --> 00:03:17,666
Anyway, this place is notorious.

00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:19,601
It's called
Finals Bridge.

00:03:19,601 --> 00:03:21,803
32 feet down
to a broken neck.

00:03:21,803 --> 00:03:23,939
So a big suicide spot?
Well, used to be

00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:26,641
till the university closed it
down five years ago. Anyway,

00:03:26,641 --> 00:03:27,943
I got to get back
to take statements

00:03:27,943 --> 00:03:29,578
from the first
responders.

00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,381
Hey, what do you got?

00:03:33,381 --> 00:03:35,016
Well, I got a beer bottle.

00:03:35,016 --> 00:03:37,719
Well, that's something.
Mm-hmm.

00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:39,988
RUSSELL:
Still wet, so it's recent.

00:03:39,988 --> 00:03:42,357
Yeah, and I got some
sediment disturbances

00:03:42,357 --> 00:03:44,459
here on the ground.

00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:46,561
And then up here...

00:03:46,561 --> 00:03:48,563
base of the lamppost.

00:03:48,563 --> 00:03:51,266
Two different sets
of shoe prints here.

00:03:51,266 --> 00:03:52,734
They're not distinct,
but it looks to me

00:03:52,734 --> 00:03:54,502
like there might
have been a struggle?

00:03:54,502 --> 00:03:56,471
Yeah.
Well, there's more...

00:03:56,471 --> 00:04:00,241
here... on the ledge.

00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,612
Doesn't look
like he jumped.

00:04:05,013 --> 00:04:08,416
Maybe someone pushed

Not one died some place where

Yeah, well it sounds like
it's been a rough night

00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,879
for everybody,
especially this guy.

00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:12,580
And you can smell it.
He's had more

00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,915
than just a
couple of beers.

00:05:13,915 --> 00:05:16,851
Long night of partying.
Things got out of hand.

00:05:16,851 --> 00:05:18,586
Student looky-loos
say they last saw him

00:05:18,586 --> 00:05:20,355
at the Theta Delta party.

00:05:22,857 --> 00:05:25,326
STOKES: Student I.D. says
Pete Moyer, sophomore.

00:05:25,326 --> 00:05:27,495
Has he got a cell phone
on him, Super Dave?

00:05:27,495 --> 00:05:30,565
No, not on him.

00:05:30,565 --> 00:05:33,535
College kid without a cell
phone, that doesn't happen.

00:05:33,535 --> 00:05:35,904
Antemortem bruising
on the face.

00:05:35,904 --> 00:05:37,739
Yeah, from a fight maybe.

00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,575
Skull's crushed.

00:05:40,575 --> 00:05:42,243
It's consistent
with the fall.

00:05:42,243 --> 00:05:43,878
BRODY: Yeah, he didn't
drop straight down.

00:05:43,878 --> 00:05:46,815
Trajectory says,
he had some momentum

00:05:46,815 --> 00:05:48,750
when he came off the bridge.

00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,886
(yelling)

00:05:51,886 --> 00:05:54,689
Suggests a push.

00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:57,392
Maybe it was from the same
person that messed up his face.

00:06:07,368 --> 00:06:11,339
What are you doing,
taking candids of our crowd?

00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:14,242
You never know if the suspect
might return to the scene.

00:06:14,242 --> 00:06:15,577
Out of feelings of guilt?

00:06:15,577 --> 00:06:17,512
Maybe they want
to enjoy the show.

00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:24,519
Ah, person of interest.

00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:25,987
Oh, yeah.
(chuckles)

00:06:27,555 --> 00:06:28,957
Charlie.

00:06:28,957 --> 00:06:30,625
Giving the girls trouble?

00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:31,860
Between school
and basketball,

00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,027
I don't really
have much time.

00:06:33,027 --> 00:06:34,262
It's good to
see you, Finn.

00:06:34,262 --> 00:06:35,764
It's really good to see you.

00:06:35,764 --> 00:06:37,732
And Dad said you two were
working together again.

00:06:37,732 --> 00:06:39,501
Yes, we are.

00:06:39,501 --> 00:06:40,835
So when are we going
to play tennis?

00:06:40,835 --> 00:06:42,370
Think you can
finally beat me?

00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:44,572
Ah, yeah, good luck
with that, buddy.

00:06:44,572 --> 00:06:45,807
How come you're not
in class?

00:06:45,807 --> 00:06:47,876
Dad, it's 7:00 a.m.

00:06:47,876 --> 00:06:50,578
Besides, everybody's
talking about this.
Yeah. I noticed that.

00:06:50,578 --> 00:06:51,813
How'd they get here
so quickly?

00:06:51,813 --> 00:06:54,315
Um, it's trending.

00:06:54,315 --> 00:06:56,451
What?
Can I see that?

00:06:56,451 --> 00:06:58,787
Posted at 3:57 a.m.

00:06:58,787 --> 00:07:00,321
User name Voyeur4U.

00:07:00,321 --> 00:07:01,723
3:57.

00:07:01,723 --> 00:07:05,560
Brass said the 911 started
coming in after 4:00.

00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,896
That means this Voyuer4U guy
knew about the body

00:07:07,896 --> 00:07:09,564
before the cops or anybody else.

00:07:09,564 --> 00:07:10,799
So this guy could
be our killer.

00:07:10,799 --> 00:07:12,634
The dude wanted
to post and boast.

00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:15,904
Just saying.

00:07:15,904 --> 00:07:17,572
That is a good theory.

00:07:19,474 --> 00:07:21,910
Must run in the blood.

00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:26,648
What can you tell me, Doc?

00:07:26,648 --> 00:07:28,249
Well, our young man's
skull fracture

00:07:28,249 --> 00:07:30,785
was accompanied by a fracture
to the C1 vertebra.

00:07:30,785 --> 00:07:32,687
Severed the spinal cord.

00:07:32,687 --> 00:07:35,323
Injuries were debilitating
and fatal.

00:07:35,323 --> 00:07:36,991
What about
the antemortem injuries?

00:07:36,991 --> 00:07:39,327
Well, besides
the split lip

00:07:39,327 --> 00:07:41,296
<i>and contusions,</i>

00:07:41,296 --> 00:07:43,698
<i>he suffered a fracture</i>
<i>to the zygomatic arch.</i>

00:07:43,698 --> 00:07:45,600
<i>Also the nasal cartilage.</i>

00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,635
<i>And there was blood</i>
<i>in the nares, the nostrils.</i>

00:07:47,635 --> 00:07:49,571
He really took a beating.

00:07:49,571 --> 00:07:51,606
Contusions take around
six hours to set.

00:07:51,606 --> 00:07:52,907
He was killed around 4:00 a.m.,

00:07:52,907 --> 00:07:54,843
means he was assaulted
around 10:00 p.m.

00:07:54,843 --> 00:07:56,644
And there were no
defensive wounds.

00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,885
The fight was one-sided.

00:08:06,855 --> 00:08:08,756
Somebody really had it in
for this kid.

00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,696
All right, so, the autopsy says

00:08:14,696 --> 00:08:17,565
that Pete Moyer got himself
beaten up at about 10:00 p.m.

00:08:17,565 --> 00:08:20,368
We didn't find any blood on
his clothes from a fight but,

00:08:20,368 --> 00:08:22,804
Nick and Greg did find bloody
clothes in his dorm room.

00:08:22,804 --> 00:08:24,672
And apart from the clothes,

00:08:24,672 --> 00:08:26,474
the room was
completely empty.

00:08:26,474 --> 00:08:27,942
What do you mean?

00:08:27,942 --> 00:08:30,278
Apparently, a bunch of
students went in there and

00:08:30,278 --> 00:08:31,512
helped themselves
to his stuff.

00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:32,881
You're kidding me.
Yeah.

00:08:32,881 --> 00:08:34,782
Isn't that disgusting?

00:08:34,782 --> 00:08:36,885
So, Pete, last night,
gets into a fight,

00:08:36,885 --> 00:08:38,620
goes back to his dorm room,

00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:42,490
changes his clothes and then
he goes the Theta Delta party.

00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:44,392
Yeah, where, maybe,
he runs into the guy

00:08:44,392 --> 00:08:46,561
that he had the fight with,
and then the fight continues,

00:08:46,561 --> 00:08:48,329
and ends on the bridge.

00:08:48,329 --> 00:08:50,398
Okay, so...

00:08:50,398 --> 00:08:52,800
sounds like we need to know
more about this party.

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,770
Oh, yeah, what about
this Voyuer4U guy

00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:57,372
who posted the photo?

00:08:57,372 --> 00:08:59,774
Yeah, Archie's working on it
right now.

00:08:59,774 --> 00:09:02,010
Yeah, please, make
yourself a home.

00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:04,512
Thank you.
I can't believe...

00:09:06,948 --> 00:09:08,583
Hey, Archie.

00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:11,519
What do you got?
Running an
ISP trace on Voyeur4U.

00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,621
Still waiting.
Are these from the Theta party?

00:09:13,621 --> 00:09:15,556
Yeah. Going through
all the posted photos

00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:16,925
looking for Pete.

00:09:16,925 --> 00:09:18,559
No luck yet, but, uh,

00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:21,262
still got another
1,367 photos to go.

00:09:21,262 --> 00:09:22,997
Oh, great.
What do you have?

00:09:22,997 --> 00:09:25,366
Pete Moyer's
FriendAgenda page.

00:09:25,366 --> 00:09:28,303
This guy lived out loud

00:09:28,303 --> 00:09:30,672
in more ways than one--
openly gay,

00:09:30,672 --> 00:09:32,407
and he didn't pull any punches
when it came

00:09:32,407 --> 00:09:34,409
to his feelings about others.
What do you mean?

00:09:34,409 --> 00:09:36,311
He kept a VLOG.
Video blog.

00:09:36,311 --> 00:09:39,380
Kind of like a campus version
of Perez Hilton.

00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:42,984
Pete posted juicy gossip
about everybody on campus.

00:09:42,984 --> 00:09:45,486
Everything from
who's sleeping with whom,

00:09:45,486 --> 00:09:47,388
to whose spring break was

00:09:47,388 --> 00:09:48,656
more like spring rehab.

00:09:48,656 --> 00:09:50,391
Okay, so sounds like this guy

00:09:50,391 --> 00:09:51,993
made a lot of
enemies, right?

00:09:51,993 --> 00:09:53,928
Oh, yeah,
one in particular--

00:09:53,928 --> 00:09:56,431
username Jonesin4.

00:09:56,431 --> 00:09:58,299
Comments are full
of homophobic slurs.

00:09:58,299 --> 00:09:59,567
Some of 'em are kind of violent.

00:09:59,567 --> 00:10:02,537
Like this one,
posted last night.

00:10:02,537 --> 00:10:04,305
"Hey, Queer.

00:10:04,305 --> 00:10:06,541
"Stop gossiping and meet up
with me, if you're man enough.

00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:08,343
Or I'll find you."

00:10:08,343 --> 00:10:10,278
Maybe this is a hate crime.

00:10:10,278 --> 00:10:11,412
Hey, guys.

00:10:11,412 --> 00:10:12,547
We got a hit on Voyeur4U.

00:10:12,547 --> 00:10:13,481
Who is it?

00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,918
Pete Moyer's account.

00:10:16,918 --> 00:10:19,554
His death shot was posted
from his own phone.

00:10:19,554 --> 00:10:21,556
We didn't find
his cell phone at the scene.

00:10:21,556 --> 00:10:23,558
Maybe the killer
picked it up, you know.

00:10:23,558 --> 00:10:24,859
He might still have it.

00:10:24,859 --> 00:10:25,994
Track the cell's GPS.

00:10:25,994 --> 00:10:27,729
Already on it.

00:10:27,729 --> 00:10:29,697
JOHNSON:
WLVU campus, Vincer Hall.

00:10:29,697 --> 00:10:31,532
That dorm has five floors.

00:10:31,532 --> 00:10:33,668
And I can track the current
altitude of that cell phone.

00:10:33,668 --> 00:10:34,836
You're kidding me.

00:10:34,836 --> 00:10:37,238
2,061 feet above sea level.

00:10:37,238 --> 00:10:39,907
So, in Vegas, that's
about 27 feet above ground.

00:10:39,907 --> 00:10:41,609
I'd say that's the third floor.
Hey, Nick.

00:10:41,609 --> 00:10:43,578
Are you and Greg
still on campus?
STOKES: Yes, sir.

00:10:43,578 --> 00:10:45,713
Yeah, we have a location
on Pete Moyer's phone.

00:10:48,316 --> 00:10:50,318
Room's clear.

00:10:50,318 --> 00:10:52,520
Next one.

00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,522
LVPD!

00:10:54,522 --> 00:10:56,958
Open up!
(window opening)

00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:58,259
Get in there, Vaughn.

00:10:59,594 --> 00:11:01,529
Don't leave out that window!

00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:04,432
Get your hands off me!

00:11:04,432 --> 00:11:05,566
Why you running, dude?

00:11:05,566 --> 00:11:07,535
Resisting arrest--
not cool.

00:11:07,535 --> 00:11:09,837
That must be Jonesin4.

00:11:09,837 --> 00:11:11,839
(chuckles)

00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,741
I think I know for what.

00:11:13,741 --> 00:11:17,645
Whatever you're jonesing
for, this guy's got it.

00:11:17,645 --> 00:11:19,414
Hey, try the number.

00:11:22,417 --> 00:11:23,951
(line ringing)

00:11:23,951 --> 00:11:25,987
(phone chiming)

00:11:31,426 --> 00:11:32,527
(sighs)

00:11:32,527 --> 00:11:33,995
Pete's phone.

00:11:33,995 --> 00:11:35,630
So you think this guy's
Pete's killer?

00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:37,999
I think we have
a strong connection.

00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:44,539
You guys got this so wrong.

00:11:47,608 --> 00:11:49,477
"Hey, Queer. Stop gossiping
and meet up with me

00:11:49,477 --> 00:11:51,679
if you're man enough.
Or I'll find you."

00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,714
Now, it sounds to me
like we've got it right.

00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:55,249
You had it in
for Pete.

00:11:55,249 --> 00:11:57,985
So is that your thing--
you like to gay-bash?

00:11:57,985 --> 00:12:01,556
The last person who'd bash Pete
for being gay is me.
Really?

00:12:01,556 --> 00:12:02,690
Why is that?

00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:05,259
Because I'm gay.

00:12:05,259 --> 00:12:07,261
"Hey, Queer" and
all that--

00:12:07,261 --> 00:12:09,497
it's just the way
we talk to each other.

00:12:09,497 --> 00:12:11,599
It's kind of an "us" versus
"you" thing.

00:12:11,599 --> 00:12:13,367
Well, we have
evidence that suggests

00:12:13,367 --> 00:12:15,636
a "you" versus "Pete" thing
on the bridge last night.

00:12:15,636 --> 00:12:17,472
We found a beer bottle
with your DNA on it

00:12:17,472 --> 00:12:19,674
in the exact spot where somebody
pushed Pete to his death.

00:12:19,674 --> 00:12:21,375
Look, I didn't kill Pete.

00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,977
Okay, you were on the bridge--
at least give me that much.

00:12:22,977 --> 00:12:24,912
Yes, I admit that,
I was on the bridge.

00:12:24,912 --> 00:12:27,515
But only because
he texted me.

00:12:27,515 --> 00:12:29,917
He said he needed help.

00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:31,519
<i>Someone had done a number</i>
<i>on him.</i>

00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,254
(phone ringing)
<i>Figured he was in trouble.</i>

00:12:35,523 --> 00:12:37,792
<i>By the time I got there,</i>
<i>he was dead.</i>

00:12:37,792 --> 00:12:39,794
<i>Whatever happened on that</i>
<i>bridge, I was too late.</i>

00:12:39,794 --> 00:12:41,896
(camera clicks)

00:12:41,896 --> 00:12:43,698
Yeah, well, you're a really
good friend, man.

00:12:43,698 --> 00:12:45,500
You find him dead,

00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,635
you take his phone, you take
his picture, and you post it

00:12:47,635 --> 00:12:49,003
to the Internet?
Yeah, what, did you forget

00:12:49,003 --> 00:12:50,371
to call 911?
I called.

00:12:50,371 --> 00:12:51,706
When I got back to my room.

00:12:51,706 --> 00:12:53,641
I told you
where to find his body.

00:12:53,641 --> 00:12:56,944
Posting that photo
is what Pete would've wanted.

00:12:56,944 --> 00:12:58,412
What's that supposed to mean?

00:12:58,412 --> 00:13:00,448
Trend To The End.

00:13:00,448 --> 00:13:01,649
All right,
well, let's say

00:13:01,649 --> 00:13:03,851
that you were just
the photographer,

00:13:03,851 --> 00:13:06,287
who do you suppose
had it in for Pete?

00:13:06,287 --> 00:13:08,256
Don't know who.

00:13:08,256 --> 00:13:09,924
Might know why.

00:13:09,924 --> 00:13:13,327
It's all about the "scan-dahl."

00:13:13,327 --> 00:13:14,695
What scandal?

00:13:14,695 --> 00:13:16,931
Pete wouldn't tell me.

00:13:16,931 --> 00:13:19,634
But he had some campus dirt
that he was going to dish.

00:13:19,634 --> 00:13:21,636
Total <i>TMZ.</i>

00:13:23,571 --> 00:13:25,573
Love me, hate me.

00:13:25,573 --> 00:13:29,577
But you know
that I live by one rule:

00:13:29,577 --> 00:13:31,779
privacy is history.

00:13:31,779 --> 00:13:35,783
The eye in the sky sees all,
shares all.

00:13:35,783 --> 00:13:39,987
Now, if you can't own it,
don't do it.

00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:42,957
Now, sometimes this means
making hard calls,

00:13:42,957 --> 00:13:44,859
hurting people close to you,

00:13:44,859 --> 00:13:48,462
but I'd be a hypocrite
if I didn't tell all.

00:13:48,462 --> 00:13:53,534
And this bomb
that I'm about to drop...

00:13:53,534 --> 00:13:57,438
it's gonna blow you away.

00:13:57,438 --> 00:13:58,706
(mimics explosion)

00:13:58,706 --> 00:14:00,408
BRODY:
Got this off Pete's phone.

00:14:00,408 --> 00:14:03,244
Thinking it was going to be
his latest VLOG entry.

00:14:03,244 --> 00:14:05,713
Or whatever his tell-all was.

00:14:05,713 --> 00:14:06,981
I think I know

00:14:06,981 --> 00:14:08,482
what it could
have been about.

00:14:08,482 --> 00:14:10,585
I found these pictures
of Pete talking

00:14:10,585 --> 00:14:12,486
to Brooke Cassidy,
the actress.

00:14:12,486 --> 00:14:13,821
Oh, more than
an actress.

00:14:13,821 --> 00:14:16,490
Brooke Cassidy
is an industry.

00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:19,327
Kids love her;
parents love her even more.
Yeah.

00:14:19,327 --> 00:14:20,528
No sex, no drugs.

00:14:20,528 --> 00:14:22,730
America's
favorite virgin.

00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:25,466
Tough act to keep up in college.

00:14:25,466 --> 00:14:27,635
Yes, and maybe she didn't,
and maybe Pete found out.

00:14:27,635 --> 00:14:29,003
And here he is,

00:14:29,003 --> 00:14:30,972
giving her the heads-up.

00:14:30,972 --> 00:14:33,708
Before he drops the bomb.

00:14:38,012 --> 00:14:39,714
Excuse me, Ms. Cassidy.

00:14:39,714 --> 00:14:41,482
We're from the Crime Lab.

00:14:41,482 --> 00:14:43,651
This is CSI Brody.
I'm CSI Finlay.

00:14:43,651 --> 00:14:45,653
We're investigating
Pete Moyer's death.

00:14:45,653 --> 00:14:47,388
It's an awful thing.
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

00:14:47,388 --> 00:14:49,724
And according
to Pete's VLOG,

00:14:49,724 --> 00:14:51,692
you guys were
pretty good friends.

00:14:51,692 --> 00:14:53,294
Yeah, that's right.

00:14:53,294 --> 00:14:55,296
According to photos posted
from the Theta party,

00:14:55,296 --> 00:14:57,632
you were one of
the last people to see him.

00:14:57,632 --> 00:14:59,267
I guess so.

00:14:59,267 --> 00:15:01,602
What exactly can you tell us
about his state of mind?

00:15:01,602 --> 00:15:02,637
I don't know.

00:15:02,637 --> 00:15:04,505
Pete was Pete.

00:15:04,505 --> 00:15:05,773
What does that mean?

00:15:05,773 --> 00:15:06,907
A hot mess.

00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:08,376
Opinionated.

00:15:08,376 --> 00:15:09,744
He could be cruel sometimes.

00:15:09,744 --> 00:15:12,380
Was he ever cruel to you?

00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,582
It seems like everybody wants
to get ahead, so they'll say

00:15:14,582 --> 00:15:16,651
whatever they want about me,
even if it's a total lie.

00:15:16,651 --> 00:15:18,519
I came here
to be a student,

00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:20,655
and I thought
that Pete respected that.

00:15:20,655 --> 00:15:22,523
And that would be
important to a woman

00:15:22,523 --> 00:15:25,359
who had made a very public
pledge of purity until marriage.

00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:26,894
What are you implying?

00:15:26,894 --> 00:15:28,562
We would just like to know

00:15:28,562 --> 00:15:29,930
what the two of you
were talking about

00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,999
before someone pushed Pete
off the bridge.

00:15:33,501 --> 00:15:35,770
Whatever it was,
you don't look happy.

00:15:37,872 --> 00:15:39,774
Okay, I don't like
where this is going.

00:15:39,774 --> 00:15:40,908
I don't either.

00:15:40,908 --> 00:15:42,476
And you are?

00:15:42,476 --> 00:15:44,312
Jake Pychan,

00:15:44,312 --> 00:15:46,547
Theta Delta Zeta president.

00:15:46,547 --> 00:15:48,416
Are these people
giving you a hard time?

00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:50,518
No. They're just asking
questions about Pete.

00:15:50,518 --> 00:15:52,520
Oh, I can tell you
all you need to know.

00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,554
Oh, great.

00:15:53,554 --> 00:15:55,556
Pete Moyer was a leech.

00:15:55,556 --> 00:15:59,026
A nobody who tried to be
a somebody by posting lies.

00:15:59,026 --> 00:16:00,761
I warned Brooke
about him.

00:16:00,761 --> 00:16:02,930
I can see you're very
protective, Mr. President.

00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:04,732
And busy.

00:16:04,732 --> 00:16:06,667
I got a class to get to.
So does Brooke.

00:16:10,705 --> 00:16:12,373
Is that everything
from Pete's room?

00:16:12,373 --> 00:16:13,708
Almost.

00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,676
Still haven't got
his computer yet.

00:16:15,676 --> 00:16:17,845
Oh, look at that.

00:16:17,845 --> 00:16:20,915
Nice to see some
things never change.

00:16:20,915 --> 00:16:22,917
Instant ramen!

00:16:22,917 --> 00:16:24,785
And a Crock-Pot.

00:16:24,785 --> 00:16:26,454
Good times.

00:16:26,454 --> 00:16:28,322
The kid had all kinds
of electronica.

00:16:28,322 --> 00:16:30,825
Cameras and microphones...

00:16:30,825 --> 00:16:32,593
listening devices.

00:16:32,593 --> 00:16:35,529
Took this whole paparazzi
thing pretty seriously.

00:16:36,831 --> 00:16:37,832
Yeah.

00:16:37,832 --> 00:16:41,402
Like, A-plus seriously.

00:16:41,402 --> 00:16:43,704
Pete wrote a term paper
here called

00:16:43,704 --> 00:16:45,005
"Phone Hacking for Hacks."

00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:46,540
It's like a how-to guide.

00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,875
Phone hacking for credit?

00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:49,744
What kind of class teaches that?

00:16:49,744 --> 00:16:52,012
Anthropology of Fame.

00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:54,315
Taught by Professor Tom Laudner.

00:16:54,315 --> 00:16:55,416
Tom Laudner?

00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:56,684
I know that guy.

00:16:56,684 --> 00:16:58,986
He has a tabloid TV show

00:16:58,986 --> 00:17:01,288
called <i>Celebrities Indisposed.</i>

00:17:01,288 --> 00:17:03,624
He earns his living
harassing celebrities.

00:17:03,624 --> 00:17:06,894
And now he's
teaching our kids, right?

00:17:06,894 --> 00:17:08,028
Hester...

00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:10,598
Prynne.

00:17:10,598 --> 00:17:12,500
<i>The Scarlet Letter.</i>

00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,001
I like to think of Hester

00:17:14,001 --> 00:17:16,871
as the first bad girl

00:17:16,871 --> 00:17:18,005
gone viral.

00:17:18,005 --> 00:17:19,874
But that was then.

00:17:19,874 --> 00:17:22,610
This... is now.

00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:25,346
Today, the scarlet letter--
it gets you a book deal,

00:17:25,346 --> 00:17:28,315
it gets you a product line,
it gets you a reality show.

00:17:28,315 --> 00:17:31,519
Fame is good.

00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:32,753
But...

00:17:32,753 --> 00:17:35,256
without the judgment

00:17:35,256 --> 00:17:36,257
of the church

00:17:36,257 --> 00:17:37,792
or the community,

00:17:37,792 --> 00:17:39,527
what's left to keep us in line?

00:17:39,527 --> 00:17:41,629
Hmm?

00:17:41,629 --> 00:17:42,997
Gossip,

00:17:42,997 --> 00:17:46,767
fear, ridicule, shame.

00:17:46,767 --> 00:17:49,003
Gossip is good.

00:17:49,003 --> 00:17:50,671
Gossip works...

00:17:50,671 --> 00:17:53,340
for society.

00:17:59,313 --> 00:18:01,849
Wow. That was a great lecture.

00:18:01,849 --> 00:18:03,584
Professor Laudner, right?

00:18:03,584 --> 00:18:05,453
Mmm, yes. Well,
I'm glad you could make it.

00:18:05,453 --> 00:18:06,787
Uh, the police, right?

00:18:06,787 --> 00:18:07,988
Uh... CSI.

00:18:07,988 --> 00:18:09,457
D.B. Russell.

00:18:09,457 --> 00:18:10,858
Oh, nice to meet you.
Yeah. You too.

00:18:10,858 --> 00:18:13,427
Yeah. I presume
this is about Pete Moyer, yeah?

00:18:13,427 --> 00:18:16,764
Yeah, yeah. He was
one of your students, right?

00:18:16,764 --> 00:18:18,666
He was my best student.
Yeah, I could tell that.

00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:20,801
You know,
I saw some of his course work.

00:18:20,801 --> 00:18:22,937
Especially that paper
on phone hacking.

00:18:22,937 --> 00:18:24,572
That was a good one.

00:18:24,572 --> 00:18:26,607
Well, maybe not so
good for Pete.

00:18:26,607 --> 00:18:30,511
See, I think he may have
tried to hack the wrong phone.

00:18:30,511 --> 00:18:31,912
Well, I mean,

00:18:31,912 --> 00:18:33,647
I couldn't tell you
anything about that.

00:18:33,647 --> 00:18:35,282
No. Well...
I mean this is a classroom

00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:37,551
and, you know, we just try
to create a safe environment

00:18:37,551 --> 00:18:40,488
for students to pursue
their intellectual muse.

00:18:40,488 --> 00:18:41,789
Oh, I'm confused.

00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:43,824
I thought you taught
a class on gossip.

00:18:43,824 --> 00:18:45,526
Oh, no, no, no, no--
I teach a course

00:18:45,526 --> 00:18:47,695
on the sociology of celebrity;
the culture of idolatry.

00:18:47,695 --> 00:18:49,363
I mean, college
is to prepare students

00:18:49,363 --> 00:18:51,432
for the real world, right?
The campus

00:18:51,432 --> 00:18:53,300
is a microcosm for society--
you got the haves,

00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,702
you got the have-nots,

00:18:54,702 --> 00:18:56,570
you've got the beautiful people,
and the, uh...

00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:57,938
you know,
not-so-beautiful people.

00:18:57,938 --> 00:18:59,974
And you got a real world actress

00:18:59,974 --> 00:19:01,642
playing student too, right?
Yeah.

00:19:01,642 --> 00:19:03,010
Brooke Cassidy? Fabulous girl.

00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:05,579
Yeah, she was kind enough
to serve as an object lesson

00:19:05,579 --> 00:19:08,415
in one of my lectures.
That was kind of her.

00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:10,284
'Cause the way I hear it,
she's, like,

00:19:10,284 --> 00:19:12,319
this scandal waiting to happen.
Yeah.

00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:13,854
Teen Dream deflowered.

00:19:13,854 --> 00:19:16,023
It'd obviously
make a good story.

00:19:16,023 --> 00:19:18,926
Hey, did you have Pete
try to hack into some of that?
Pete? No, no, no, no.

00:19:18,926 --> 00:19:20,427
He's one of my students,

00:19:20,427 --> 00:19:22,530
he's not one of my employees.
(laughs)

00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:24,565
Right. Right, right, right.

00:19:24,565 --> 00:19:27,401
Listen, what I can tell you
about Pete...

00:19:27,401 --> 00:19:29,003
as "out" as he was,

00:19:29,003 --> 00:19:31,438
he kept a few things
in the closet.

00:19:33,307 --> 00:19:35,543
That's as close as you'll get
to an exclusive from me.

00:19:35,543 --> 00:19:37,678
Okay.
I hope you return the favor.

00:19:37,678 --> 00:19:40,881
Oh, hey, thank you so much.
That was very helpful.
No, no, no, thank you.

00:19:40,881 --> 00:19:43,450
Nice to meet you, sir.
Take care.
Yeah, you, too.

00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:45,553
Good luck.
Thanks.

00:19:52,426 --> 00:19:54,562
What are we looking for exactly?

00:19:54,562 --> 00:19:55,896
Oh, you know,

00:19:55,896 --> 00:19:57,531
something besides
a computer

00:19:57,531 --> 00:19:59,266
or a hard drive

00:19:59,266 --> 00:20:01,368
where Pete could've stored
whatever dirt he dug up

00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:02,937
on Brooke Cassidy.

00:20:02,937 --> 00:20:04,972
You sure the professor's
not just messing with you?

00:20:04,972 --> 00:20:06,941
He was pretty clear
about the quid pro quo.

00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:12,580
I think I...

00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:14,848
may have just found the quid.

00:20:14,848 --> 00:20:16,717
I got to get me one of those.

00:20:22,456 --> 00:20:24,325
Flash drive.

00:20:24,325 --> 00:20:25,960
Let's check it out.

00:20:32,032 --> 00:20:33,467
Okay.

00:20:35,636 --> 00:20:37,838
Let's see what's in
Brooke's folder.

00:20:41,475 --> 00:20:44,345
Wow. Okay, so Pete
wasn't just hacking messages.

00:20:44,345 --> 00:20:46,413
He was hacking into
e-mails and photos.

00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:47,348
Mm-hmm.

00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:52,252
America's favorite virgin's
looking pretty virginal.

00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:54,655
There's nothing really
controversial here.

00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:56,357
Let's check Jake's file.

00:21:08,569 --> 00:21:09,837
Okay, wait a minute now.

00:21:11,805 --> 00:21:13,941
I've seen that
tatt before.

00:21:13,941 --> 00:21:17,411
Where?
Climbing out a window at WLVU.

00:21:19,413 --> 00:21:20,981
That's Sebastian Jones.

00:21:20,981 --> 00:21:23,283
One of Pete Moyer's buddies.

00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:24,952
Hmm.

00:21:26,253 --> 00:21:27,688
Whoa.

00:21:27,688 --> 00:21:29,289
Looks like
he's got another buddy.

00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:30,524
That's Brooke's boyfriend,

00:21:30,524 --> 00:21:32,292
Jake Pychan.

00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:35,029
Looks like boyfriend's
got a beard.

00:21:42,836 --> 00:21:44,471
Where did you get these?

00:21:44,471 --> 00:21:45,839
Not off the computer

00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:47,474
you stole from
Pete Moyer's dorm room,

00:21:47,474 --> 00:21:48,809
if that's what you mean.

00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:50,678
We found his computer
under your bed.

00:21:50,678 --> 00:21:53,447
RUSSELL:
Those photos were on a
flash drive that Pete hid

00:21:53,447 --> 00:21:54,848
in some dirty clothes.

00:21:54,848 --> 00:21:56,483
But you didn't
think to look there.

00:21:56,483 --> 00:21:58,452
And they came from your phone.

00:21:58,452 --> 00:21:59,953
Which Pete hacked into.
Son of a bitch.

00:21:59,953 --> 00:22:01,722
I guess you
didn't take that

00:22:01,722 --> 00:22:03,557
same purity pledge
as your girlfriend.

00:22:03,557 --> 00:22:05,259
That isn't sex.

00:22:05,259 --> 00:22:07,494
Oh, I don't think your
girlfriend would agree.

00:22:07,494 --> 00:22:09,530
Does she know you're gay?
I'm not gay.

00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:10,631
RUSSELL:
Gay, straight,

00:22:10,631 --> 00:22:11,999
your business,
or at least

00:22:11,999 --> 00:22:14,368
it was your business right up
until Pete

00:22:14,368 --> 00:22:17,237
decided to make it everyone
else's.

00:22:17,237 --> 00:22:18,872
BRASS:
And then you threw
him off the bridge.

00:22:18,872 --> 00:22:20,541
I didn't touch him.

00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:22,309
When I saw him last night
at the Theta house,

00:22:22,309 --> 00:22:23,711
somebody already worked him
over pretty good.

00:22:23,711 --> 00:22:24,978
Well, then, you won't mind

00:22:24,978 --> 00:22:26,613
giving us your prints
and some DNA?

00:22:26,613 --> 00:22:28,482
I have rights.

00:22:28,482 --> 00:22:30,718
Yeah, you got rights, but you're
a suspect in a murder case.

00:22:30,718 --> 00:22:32,820
And we don't have a lot of time,
so tell us what happened.

00:22:37,624 --> 00:22:41,995
Sebastian texted me
after Pete was dead.

00:22:41,995 --> 00:22:43,363
He said...

00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:45,299
Pete might have
some photos of us.

00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:47,267
Sebastian already
had his phone,

00:22:47,267 --> 00:22:48,736
so I went for his computer.

00:22:48,736 --> 00:22:51,472
I just didn't want them
getting online.

00:22:51,472 --> 00:22:53,774
People wouldn't understand.
RUSSELL:
Well, then,

00:22:53,774 --> 00:22:55,709
give us what we need,
you know, help us

00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:58,812
rule you out as a
suspect, and if you do,

00:22:58,812 --> 00:23:01,715
I promise that these photos
will get buried

00:23:01,715 --> 00:23:02,683
in the evidence vault.

00:23:02,683 --> 00:23:03,751
We can do that, can't we?

00:23:03,751 --> 00:23:04,685
Yeah, sure.

00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:11,759
Okay.

00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:12,893
Ah. Yeah, there you go.

00:23:18,031 --> 00:23:19,867
Thank you.

00:23:19,867 --> 00:23:22,770
JOHNSON:
Why does a gossip hound need
military-grade encryption

00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:24,705
for his computer files?

00:23:24,705 --> 00:23:27,775
Well, certainly not 'cause
he respected anyone's privacy.

00:23:27,775 --> 00:23:31,779
Probably just didn't want
to get scooped himself.

00:23:31,779 --> 00:23:33,914
So, how long till you
can unscramble it?

00:23:33,914 --> 00:23:36,550
This is complicated.
I'm gonna need some time.

00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:39,753
When I said Pete was taking
his paparazzi work seriously,

00:23:39,753 --> 00:23:41,789
I didn't realize
he went full-tilt P.I.

00:23:41,789 --> 00:23:44,725
Must have dropped a mint
at some spy store.

00:23:44,725 --> 00:23:45,959
What is that?

00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:49,797
A remote digital receiver.

00:23:49,797 --> 00:23:52,466
JOHNSON:
Oh, that's top of the line.

00:23:52,466 --> 00:23:53,667
(beeps)
Ah.

00:23:53,667 --> 00:23:56,270
Still receiving a signal.

00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,538
(keyboarding)

00:23:57,538 --> 00:23:59,706
That's a live feed
from a camera...

00:24:00,841 --> 00:24:02,009
...mounted

00:24:02,009 --> 00:24:03,544
somewhere.
SANDERS:
Maybe an office?

00:24:03,544 --> 00:24:05,312
This picture's fuzzy 'cause

00:24:05,312 --> 00:24:07,247
we're at the edge
of the camera's broadcast range.

00:24:07,247 --> 00:24:09,817
Pete Moyer's entire
world is WLVU.

00:24:09,817 --> 00:24:12,653
I guarantee you this room
is somewhere on campus.

00:24:12,653 --> 00:24:13,787
Can you get me a better picture

00:24:13,787 --> 00:24:14,822
at all?

00:24:14,822 --> 00:24:16,423
No. You guys should just start

00:24:16,423 --> 00:24:17,858
walking this thing
back towards campus.

00:24:20,427 --> 00:24:22,830
Or I could try and do my job,

00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:27,000
amplify the reception range
and get a cleaner image.

00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,335
That's a good idea.

00:24:28,335 --> 00:24:29,570
Second.

00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:30,904
Yeah.

00:24:33,707 --> 00:24:35,442
Hey.

00:24:35,442 --> 00:24:36,743
Mom insisted. She's worried

00:24:36,743 --> 00:24:38,278
you're not taking care
of yourself.

00:24:38,278 --> 00:24:40,747
Come on in.

00:24:41,815 --> 00:24:43,851
Case must be
going well.

00:24:43,851 --> 00:24:45,786
Hear you have a suspect
in custody.

00:24:47,321 --> 00:24:48,689
You're trending.

00:24:48,689 --> 00:24:50,691
I'll be darned.

00:24:50,691 --> 00:24:52,392
So, it's like the court
of public opinion

00:24:52,392 --> 00:24:53,994
in the digital age, right?

00:24:53,994 --> 00:24:55,729
Yeah.

00:24:55,729 --> 00:24:58,465
Oh. What... What do you...
what you got there?

00:24:58,465 --> 00:24:59,733
Are those salt and

00:24:59,733 --> 00:25:01,902
vinegar chips?
Mm-hmm.

00:25:01,902 --> 00:25:04,304
(chuckles)
Oh, yeah.

00:25:05,405 --> 00:25:07,341
It's nice to see Finn.

00:25:07,341 --> 00:25:08,709
Yeah.

00:25:08,709 --> 00:25:10,911
How's that working for you?

00:25:10,911 --> 00:25:13,947
It's fine.

00:25:13,947 --> 00:25:15,015
Why do you ask?

00:25:15,015 --> 00:25:17,417
Just kind of a drag last time.

00:25:19,486 --> 00:25:21,622
Well, second time's a charm.

00:25:21,622 --> 00:25:23,590
Yeah, hope so.

00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:25,826
Mom's not the only one
who worries.

00:25:29,363 --> 00:25:31,031
(quietly):
Ugh...

00:25:31,031 --> 00:25:33,333
BRODY:
Finn?

00:25:33,333 --> 00:25:35,035
Morgan, did you bring lunch?

00:25:35,035 --> 00:25:36,803
We have company.

00:25:37,871 --> 00:25:39,306
Hi.

00:25:39,306 --> 00:25:40,774
Oh, hi.

00:25:41,975 --> 00:25:43,610
Um, have a seat.

00:25:45,012 --> 00:25:46,613
Thank you.

00:25:46,613 --> 00:25:47,981
I didn't want to
be seen walking

00:25:47,981 --> 00:25:49,750
into the police department,
so, I thought

00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:50,984
I could talk
to you guys instead?

00:25:50,984 --> 00:25:52,719
Sure.
Of course you can.

00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:54,421
I know Jake's been arrested,

00:25:54,421 --> 00:25:57,024
but he had nothing to do
with Pete's death.

00:25:57,024 --> 00:26:00,694
Really? And why
are you so sure about that?

00:26:00,694 --> 00:26:02,996
Because I was with him...
all night.

00:26:04,264 --> 00:26:05,899
All night?

00:26:05,899 --> 00:26:07,534
Yeah, at the party
and at the bridge

00:26:07,534 --> 00:26:09,303
with everyone else,
after you guys found Pete.

00:26:11,939 --> 00:26:14,374
You don't have to have sex
to spend the night with someone.

00:26:14,374 --> 00:26:17,511
No. No, you don't,
and I'm sure

00:26:17,511 --> 00:26:19,513
it's easier to keep
your pledge of purity

00:26:19,513 --> 00:26:21,648
when your boyfriend's
not that into you.

00:26:21,648 --> 00:26:23,517
Look, I'm not naive.

00:26:23,517 --> 00:26:25,018
When I met Jake,

00:26:25,018 --> 00:26:26,720
I really liked him.

00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,822
You know, he was
the perfect boyfriend for me.

00:26:28,822 --> 00:26:30,590
Sexually confused enough

00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:32,826
that he would never
pressure me to break my vow,

00:26:32,826 --> 00:26:34,861
which, believe it or not,

00:26:34,861 --> 00:26:36,697
is very important to me.

00:26:36,697 --> 00:26:40,701
Uh, Brooke,
we have evidence that

00:26:40,701 --> 00:26:43,270
Pete knew about Jake's
sexual confusion,

00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:44,905
and may have been
planning to out him.

00:26:44,905 --> 00:26:46,440
BRODY:
Is that why

00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,908
you and Pete were fighting
at the party?

00:26:47,908 --> 00:26:49,509
We weren't fighting
at the party.

00:26:49,509 --> 00:26:51,578
No, it had nothing
to do with Jake.

00:26:51,578 --> 00:26:53,447
Pete was venting
about Professor Laudner.

00:26:53,447 --> 00:26:54,815
BRODY:
Professor Laudner?

00:26:54,815 --> 00:26:56,850
Why?
Because Laudner's
a douche.

00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:59,553
And Pete idolized him,
wanted to be just like him.

00:26:59,553 --> 00:27:01,688
I don't know what went
down between those two, but

00:27:01,688 --> 00:27:04,591
Pete told me
I was right all along.

00:27:04,591 --> 00:27:06,293
Did he mention
a physical altercation

00:27:06,293 --> 00:27:07,961
that took place
with Professor Laudner?

00:27:07,961 --> 00:27:10,364
I asked him
why his face was all messed up,

00:27:10,364 --> 00:27:12,933
and he told me
to check his next VLOG.

00:27:12,933 --> 00:27:15,402
That the truth
would be revealed.

00:27:19,473 --> 00:27:20,774
Hey, Greg.

00:27:20,774 --> 00:27:22,743
I tried boosting
the reception

00:27:22,743 --> 00:27:25,312
from Pete's camera, but, uh, the
image didn't get much better.

00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:28,415
So, I enhanced this
one area here.

00:27:28,415 --> 00:27:30,550
Looks like a poster.

00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:33,887
Yeah, for
<i>Celebrities Indisposed.</i>

00:27:33,887 --> 00:27:37,391
Pete's camera is
in Tom Laudner's office.

00:27:40,994 --> 00:27:42,929
(sighs)

00:27:47,267 --> 00:27:48,602
There's the poster.

00:27:48,602 --> 00:27:50,003
Camera's got to
be somewhere

00:27:50,003 --> 00:27:51,438
over there.

00:27:51,438 --> 00:27:52,572
Yeah.

00:27:57,744 --> 00:28:00,614
Bookcase is a good place
to hide a camera.

00:28:08,522 --> 00:28:11,591
Think I got something
on the top shelf.

00:28:11,591 --> 00:28:12,926
Here it is.

00:28:17,731 --> 00:28:20,267
And that's what
it's looking at.

00:28:25,572 --> 00:28:27,574
Yeah, well,

00:28:27,574 --> 00:28:29,309
there's only one reason

00:28:29,309 --> 00:28:31,578
why Pete Moyer would want
a bird's-eye view of

00:28:31,578 --> 00:28:33,346
Professor Laudner's couch.

00:28:38,985 --> 00:28:40,020
Ah, Professor.

00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,922
Thanks for coming down.

00:28:41,922 --> 00:28:44,391
Didn't seem like I had a choice.

00:28:44,391 --> 00:28:46,593
You didn't.

00:28:46,593 --> 00:28:48,495
Sit down, please.

00:28:48,495 --> 00:28:50,697
I have something that
I want to show you.

00:28:50,697 --> 00:28:51,865
Really?

00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:58,605
That's my office.

00:28:58,605 --> 00:28:59,906
Do you have a warrant?
Actually,

00:28:59,906 --> 00:29:01,374
that's university property.

00:29:01,374 --> 00:29:03,009
And yeah, they've been served.

00:29:03,009 --> 00:29:04,544
But you don't have
probable cause

00:29:04,544 --> 00:29:06,480
for any wiretapping
or surveillance.

00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,381
That's true, that's
true, we don't.

00:29:08,381 --> 00:29:12,252
You see, Pete Moyer put
that camera in your office.

00:29:12,252 --> 00:29:13,653
He's the one who's
been watching you.

00:29:27,701 --> 00:29:29,035
Got a blood drop.

00:29:32,639 --> 00:29:34,975
Yep.
Somebody cleaned up this rug.

00:29:48,288 --> 00:29:52,259
If that's
Pete Moyer's blood,

00:29:52,259 --> 00:29:53,827
then he was beaten
in this room.

00:29:58,765 --> 00:30:00,834
RUSSELL:
<i>So,</i>

00:30:00,834 --> 00:30:02,469
Pete was in your office
last night,

00:30:02,469 --> 00:30:04,304
and the two of you got
into a fight.

00:30:04,304 --> 00:30:06,439
Yeah. That's none
of your business.
You're pulling

00:30:06,439 --> 00:30:08,441
the privacy card. Wow.

00:30:08,441 --> 00:30:10,310
After you made a career

00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:12,712
out of exposing
everyone else's business.

00:30:12,712 --> 00:30:15,815
That's a little hypocritical,
don't you think?

00:30:15,815 --> 00:30:16,883
Guilty.

00:30:16,883 --> 00:30:18,685
Do you have anything else?

00:30:18,685 --> 00:30:20,554
Yeah, actually I do. Thank you.

00:30:20,554 --> 00:30:24,457
I have blood...
on your rug.

00:30:24,457 --> 00:30:27,928
See, you tried to clean it up,
which makes it my business.

00:30:34,501 --> 00:30:35,802
Oh, this thing had
quite a workout.

00:30:35,802 --> 00:30:37,771
Yeah. Maybe

00:30:37,771 --> 00:30:40,473
one of Laudner's students was
riding the extra credit couch.

00:30:43,777 --> 00:30:47,581
Your office hours must
be very stimulating.

00:30:47,581 --> 00:30:49,616
I'm sorry.
Did I miss the question?

00:30:49,616 --> 00:30:54,020
How many women are enrolled in
your Anthropology of Fame class?

00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,889
Thirty-eight.

00:30:55,889 --> 00:30:58,858
And how many
have you had sex with?

00:30:58,858 --> 00:31:00,727
Okay, here's what I
think happened. I think

00:31:00,727 --> 00:31:03,430
Pete Moyer found out,
confirmed it with his camera,

00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:05,031
and then threatened
to expose you.

00:31:05,031 --> 00:31:06,766
Mr. Russell,

00:31:06,766 --> 00:31:08,935
even gossip is woven
with a thread of truth.

00:31:08,935 --> 00:31:11,504
Then I think that you tried
to rough him up a little bit,

00:31:11,504 --> 00:31:12,772
but when that
didn't work, I think

00:31:12,772 --> 00:31:14,474
you lured him out
to Finals Bridge.

00:31:14,474 --> 00:31:15,675
What, and pushed him off?

00:31:15,675 --> 00:31:17,377
You thought it would
look like a suicide.

00:31:17,377 --> 00:31:20,013
Your protégé caught you
with your pants down, Professor.

00:31:20,013 --> 00:31:22,849
You panicked, you thought
that the scandal would ruin you.

00:31:22,849 --> 00:31:24,618
Are you serious?

00:31:24,618 --> 00:31:26,953
Teacher sleeps with students,
none of them underage,

00:31:26,953 --> 00:31:28,822
not the same sex,

00:31:28,822 --> 00:31:32,025
and all of them consensual.

00:31:32,025 --> 00:31:33,526
What scandal?

00:31:38,265 --> 00:31:39,432
Hey, Nick?

00:31:39,432 --> 00:31:42,035
Come here for a second,
will you?

00:31:42,035 --> 00:31:43,803
Yeah.

00:31:43,803 --> 00:31:47,507
I hate it when a suspect blows a
hole in a perfectly good theory.

00:31:47,507 --> 00:31:49,242
Professor Laudner.

00:31:49,242 --> 00:31:51,244
Okay, okay,
now, so what

00:31:51,244 --> 00:31:53,913
if Pete Moyer recorded
the professor having sex--

00:31:53,913 --> 00:31:56,716
consensual sex-- with a student?

00:31:56,716 --> 00:31:58,685
Seven different students.

00:31:58,685 --> 00:32:00,587
Whoa.
According to
the vaginal contributions

00:32:00,587 --> 00:32:02,589
on the couch,
he was a busy man.
But that just

00:32:02,589 --> 00:32:05,292
makes him the guy who can.
It doesn't make him a killer.

00:32:05,292 --> 00:32:07,560
And like he said in
his dumb lectures,

00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,429
sex scandal nowadays just means

00:32:09,429 --> 00:32:12,432
that you got yourself
a book tour, a reality show,

00:32:12,432 --> 00:32:14,601
and a movie deal,
for crying out loud.

00:32:14,601 --> 00:32:16,970
You're not really letting
this guy get to you, are you?

00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:18,305
That's beside
the point.

00:32:18,305 --> 00:32:19,439
What I don't see is

00:32:19,439 --> 00:32:21,408
a motive for killing Pete.

00:32:21,408 --> 00:32:22,709
We know he punched him.

00:32:22,709 --> 00:32:24,277
We confirmed it was Pete's blood

00:32:24,277 --> 00:32:25,412
in Laudner's office.

00:32:25,412 --> 00:32:26,780
Okay, but if...

00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,548
if the fight wasn't
about a sex scandal,

00:32:28,548 --> 00:32:29,716
then what was it?

00:32:31,818 --> 00:32:34,354
You never know what you're gonna
see when you turn a camera on.

00:32:34,354 --> 00:32:35,955
Or what people
are gonna do.

00:32:35,955 --> 00:32:38,958
Maybe Pete saw
something more than sex.

00:32:38,958 --> 00:32:40,660
Maybe Pete saw

00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:43,697
something Laudner
didn't want him to.

00:32:43,697 --> 00:32:45,365
I wouldn't put it past Laudner

00:32:45,365 --> 00:32:46,866
to take advantage
of his students, would you?

00:32:46,866 --> 00:32:49,269
And maybe not take no
for an answer.

00:32:49,269 --> 00:32:50,737
Maybe.

00:32:50,737 --> 00:32:52,339
I like that.

00:32:52,339 --> 00:32:56,643
Okay, we need to identify
these seven women.

00:33:01,581 --> 00:33:04,250
(quiet, indistinct chatter)

00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,855
You see the cops
take him away?

00:33:08,855 --> 00:33:11,624
Yeah.
So it's got to
be true, right?

00:33:11,624 --> 00:33:14,994
Professor Laudner's
been arrested?

00:33:14,994 --> 00:33:16,296
Good afternoon, class.

00:33:16,296 --> 00:33:18,298
My name is
Julie Finlay,

00:33:18,298 --> 00:33:20,834
and this is Morgan Brody.

00:33:20,834 --> 00:33:22,502
We work with the Crime Lab.

00:33:22,502 --> 00:33:27,307
We are here investigating
the death of Pete Moyer.

00:33:27,307 --> 00:33:28,742
We are going to share
details with you

00:33:28,742 --> 00:33:30,844
regarding our
homicide investigation.

00:33:30,844 --> 00:33:34,581
Now, this information has been
withheld from the public.

00:33:34,581 --> 00:33:36,483
FINLAY:
We discovered
epithelials,

00:33:36,483 --> 00:33:38,752
skin cell DNA, under
the victim's fingernails,

00:33:38,752 --> 00:33:41,654
which tells us that
he struggled with his killer

00:33:41,654 --> 00:33:43,656
in the moments before his death.

00:33:43,656 --> 00:33:46,626
(murmuring)
BRODY:
The way this works,

00:33:46,626 --> 00:33:49,763
we start by trying
to exclude Pete's
classmates and friends,

00:33:49,763 --> 00:33:51,865
in order to zero in
on our killer.

00:33:51,865 --> 00:33:53,466
Now, in order to do that,

00:33:53,466 --> 00:33:56,002
we need to collect DNA samples
from all of you.

00:33:56,002 --> 00:33:58,271
What if we refuse?

00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:00,840
FINLAY:
Well, you do have

00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:01,875
that legal right--

00:34:01,875 --> 00:34:03,777
this is strictly voluntary--

00:34:03,777 --> 00:34:05,412
but I would like

00:34:05,412 --> 00:34:07,881
to ask you all to refrain
from spreading false rumors

00:34:07,881 --> 00:34:10,517
about any classmates
who refuse to cooperate.

00:34:10,517 --> 00:34:14,454
So no sharing,
no posting, no kidding.

00:34:18,258 --> 00:34:20,460
First volunteers
get the clean swabs.

00:34:26,766 --> 00:34:28,835
I can't believe
that just worked.
Mm-hmm.

00:34:33,807 --> 00:34:35,675
ANDREWS:
<i>Hey, Nick.</i>

00:34:35,675 --> 00:34:38,011
I identified the seven
vaginal contributors
from the couch

00:34:38,011 --> 00:34:39,446
in Professor
Laudner's office.

00:34:39,446 --> 00:34:41,514
All these girls
were in his class.

00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:45,318
All right, I'll have
Brass bring them in.

are you asking me if I had sex
with Professor Laudner?

00:34:54,727 --> 00:34:57,964
I'm asking you if
it was consensual.

00:34:57,964 --> 00:34:59,833
I took Laudner's class
for an easy "A."

00:34:59,833 --> 00:35:01,568
Everybody knows

00:35:01,568 --> 00:35:03,336
that if you're a pretty girl,
wear a short skirt

00:35:03,336 --> 00:35:05,672
and sit in the front row,
you get an "A."

00:35:05,672 --> 00:35:08,408
Did he promise if you slept
with him he'd give you an "A"?

00:35:08,408 --> 00:35:11,778
He never made
any promises, but...

00:35:11,778 --> 00:35:13,646
it was understood.

offered sex for grades.

00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:32,732
I just would like
to ask if you had

00:35:32,732 --> 00:35:35,768
consensual sex with
Professor Laudner.

00:35:39,939 --> 00:35:41,407
Did Professor Laudner hurt you?

00:35:41,407 --> 00:35:42,675
I don't want
to talk about it.

00:35:45,478 --> 00:35:48,248
Ashley, I know you want to
help us find Pete's killer.

00:35:50,984 --> 00:35:54,020
I think Pete found out
about what happened to you,

00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,989
and then he tried to help you.

00:35:55,989 --> 00:35:57,790
Pete did not
want to help me.

00:35:57,790 --> 00:35:59,292
Pete only cared about Pete

00:35:59,292 --> 00:36:00,693
and his damn gossip!

00:36:02,695 --> 00:36:05,598
I didn't want to talk to Pete,
and I don't want to talk to you.

00:36:05,598 --> 00:36:07,867
I have a right to be left alone.
Ashley,

00:36:07,867 --> 00:36:09,869
I understand that...

00:36:09,869 --> 00:36:12,705
but what Pete found out
cost him his life,

00:36:12,705 --> 00:36:15,441
so I need you to help me find
out what happened to him,

00:36:15,441 --> 00:36:17,577
and I need you
to let me help you.

00:36:17,577 --> 00:36:19,479
You can't help me!

00:36:19,479 --> 00:36:20,880
No one can!

00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,448
I would like to try.

00:36:22,448 --> 00:36:23,750
I killed Pete!

00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:26,386
Okay? I was the reason
he was at that bridge!

00:36:26,386 --> 00:36:28,021
I pushed him off!

00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:32,725
Can you help me now?

00:36:32,725 --> 00:36:34,727
(sobbing)

00:36:34,727 --> 00:36:36,796
(continues sobbing)

00:36:36,796 --> 00:36:39,499
ASHLEY:
Get off me! Please!

00:36:39,499 --> 00:36:42,335
JOHNSON:
Finally decrypted
Pete's hard drive.

00:36:42,335 --> 00:36:44,003
Been through
all the videos.

00:36:44,003 --> 00:36:45,772
A lot of sex, but...

00:36:45,772 --> 00:36:47,507
nothing like this.

00:36:47,507 --> 00:36:49,242
(turns off video)

00:36:49,242 --> 00:36:50,877
That is so
clearly rape.

00:36:50,877 --> 00:36:52,879
Why wouldn't Ashley
have reported it?

00:36:52,879 --> 00:36:55,381
A lot of shame associated
with sexual assault.

00:36:55,381 --> 00:36:56,816
Especially if the rapist

00:36:56,816 --> 00:36:58,585
is known to the victim.

00:36:58,585 --> 00:37:02,255
So, Mandy matched three unknown
sets of prints from the bridge

00:37:02,255 --> 00:37:05,758
to the ten-card that Finlay
collected from Ashley Benson.

00:37:05,758 --> 00:37:08,027
So she <i>was</i> there?
Yeah.

00:37:08,027 --> 00:37:09,796
The problem is,
there's an inconsistency

00:37:09,796 --> 00:37:11,631
with her confession.

00:37:11,631 --> 00:37:13,833
Mind if I get in there?

00:37:13,833 --> 00:37:14,968
So...

00:37:14,968 --> 00:37:17,036
all of her prints are on...

00:37:17,036 --> 00:37:18,905
this lamppost.

00:37:18,905 --> 00:37:21,641
The first set is
at approximately five feet.

00:37:21,641 --> 00:37:24,010
The highest is
a little over eight.

00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:26,579
Well, Ashley's
about my height, so...

00:37:28,514 --> 00:37:30,550
Here's your first
set of prints.

00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:33,753
Okay.
Add what, 18 inches

00:37:33,753 --> 00:37:35,688
for the bench?

00:37:49,702 --> 00:37:51,838
There's your
second set of prints.

00:37:51,838 --> 00:37:54,273
Well, another 18 inches,
and you're at eight feet.

00:37:54,273 --> 00:37:56,309
Looks like you might
need a little help

00:37:56,309 --> 00:37:58,011
to get there.

00:38:06,386 --> 00:38:07,420
Ashley was climbing.

00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:10,323
Yep. Right onto the ledge.

00:38:18,698 --> 00:38:22,368
Pete followed me
to the bridge...

00:38:22,368 --> 00:38:25,938
ambushed me as I was
leaving the party.

00:38:25,938 --> 00:38:27,640
He said he knew what
Laudner had done to me

00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:30,276
and he'd seen it
with his own eyes.
So he...

00:38:30,276 --> 00:38:31,711
told you about the tape?
Yeah,

00:38:31,711 --> 00:38:33,780
he said he was gonna
post it on his Web site

00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:38,017
and that he wanted
my exclusive.

00:38:38,017 --> 00:38:39,886
I knew the rumors.

00:38:39,886 --> 00:38:43,423
I knew that some of the girls
were sleeping with him.

00:38:44,624 --> 00:38:46,759
(crying):
But I'm not like that.

00:38:46,759 --> 00:38:48,928
(sobbing)

00:38:48,928 --> 00:38:50,596
I should have taken the "C."

00:38:50,596 --> 00:38:55,668
I was trying so hard to get
into business school, and...

00:38:55,668 --> 00:38:58,571
Ashley, you did
nothing wrong; nothing.

00:38:58,571 --> 00:39:00,773
Have you seen it?

00:39:01,874 --> 00:39:04,877
The tape is evidence.

00:39:04,877 --> 00:39:07,447
(sobbing): So it's
gonna be everywhere.

00:39:09,315 --> 00:39:11,484
I need you to tell
me what happened.

00:39:11,484 --> 00:39:13,953
(laughs): I... I
thought Pete was there

00:39:13,953 --> 00:39:15,955
because he actually
cared about me.

00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:22,361
PETE:
Look, forget my VLOG.

00:39:22,361 --> 00:39:24,530
I'll go with you to the cops;
we'll talk to them together.

00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:27,633
It doesn't matter!
He raped me!

00:39:27,633 --> 00:39:28,768
You don't have to do this.

00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:30,837
He said we
couldn't give up,

00:39:30,837 --> 00:39:33,339
and that I couldn't
let Laudner win.

00:39:33,339 --> 00:39:35,475
I want it to be over!

00:39:35,475 --> 00:39:36,909
Come here.

00:39:36,909 --> 00:39:39,011
Take my hand.

00:39:39,011 --> 00:39:40,646
Hey, you have to trust me.

00:39:42,615 --> 00:39:44,617
<i>And then I turned around,</i>

00:39:44,617 --> 00:39:47,787
<i>and he had his phone out.</i>

00:39:47,787 --> 00:39:50,656
He was recording us,
or-or texting,

00:39:50,656 --> 00:39:52,658
or tweeting,
I don't know, but...

00:39:52,658 --> 00:39:55,294
I knocked it
out of his hand.

00:40:02,502 --> 00:40:05,338
(Pete yelling)

00:40:05,338 --> 00:40:09,442
(sobbing): If I just hadn't
gone into Laudner's office,

00:40:09,442 --> 00:40:11,778
Pete would still be alive!
Ashley,

00:40:11,778 --> 00:40:14,347
from what you're telling
me, it was an accident.

00:40:14,347 --> 00:40:15,782
It was not your fault.

00:40:15,782 --> 00:40:18,785
Okay? None of this
is your fault.

00:40:18,785 --> 00:40:22,655
Not Pete's death, and certainly
not what Laudner did to you.

00:40:22,655 --> 00:40:26,692
I lived with it for 13 days.

00:40:26,692 --> 00:40:27,894
I went to class.

00:40:27,894 --> 00:40:31,330
I worked at my job.

00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:32,799
I talked to my parents.

00:40:32,799 --> 00:40:34,567
I just...

00:40:34,567 --> 00:40:38,337
I boxed it up,
and I put it on a shelf.

00:40:38,337 --> 00:40:40,406
Ashley, listen to me:

00:40:40,406 --> 00:40:41,841
I am gonna have
experts testify

00:40:41,841 --> 00:40:43,943
to your behavior, so that
when you take the stand,

00:40:43,943 --> 00:40:47,280
the jury will know why you
went back to that class.

00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,615
A jury?

00:40:49,615 --> 00:40:52,819
I-I can't stand
in front of a jury.

00:40:52,819 --> 00:40:55,955
There is no hope of stopping
Laudner if you don't.

00:40:55,955 --> 00:40:57,490
That's not my problem.

00:40:58,825 --> 00:41:02,428
I just want to be left alone.

00:41:02,428 --> 00:41:04,030
Please.

00:41:13,706 --> 00:41:17,243
(Finlay sighs)

00:41:17,243 --> 00:41:18,578
BRASS:
You know I talked
to the D.A.

00:41:18,578 --> 00:41:20,947
She's not gonna file
on just the tape.

00:41:20,947 --> 00:41:25,318
Which means the guy walks.
Yeah, and the bastard's gonna go
do it again to another girl.

00:41:25,318 --> 00:41:26,919
We have to take our
victims as they come.

00:41:35,361 --> 00:41:36,529
CHARLIE:
Hey, Dad.

00:41:36,529 --> 00:41:37,964
Oh. Hey.

00:41:37,964 --> 00:41:39,732
You look terrible.

00:41:39,732 --> 00:41:41,300
Oh, thanks a lot.

00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:42,969
Were we supposed
to be doing something?

00:41:42,969 --> 00:41:44,570
No, but Mom thought

00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:46,305
it would be cool
if we all met up for dinner.

00:41:46,305 --> 00:41:49,308
Oh, that sounds fun.

00:41:49,308 --> 00:41:50,810
Something wrong?
Well,

00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:53,512
some cases don't end up
the way you want them to.

00:41:53,512 --> 00:41:56,616
Yeah, but this
one did, right?

00:41:56,616 --> 00:41:57,617
No.

00:41:57,617 --> 00:41:59,518
Really? Check it out.

00:41:59,518 --> 00:42:00,920
It's all over
the Internet--

00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,521
Professor Laudner
raped a student.

00:42:02,521 --> 00:42:05,892
Ah. News travels fast,
doesn't it?

00:42:05,892 --> 00:42:08,427
The university
suspended him.

00:42:08,427 --> 00:42:09,562
What?

00:42:09,562 --> 00:42:11,831
I mean, look at
all these posts.

00:42:11,831 --> 00:42:13,566
It's not like he's
gonna get away with it.

00:42:16,002 --> 00:42:17,870
Yeah.

00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:19,605
So...

00:42:19,605 --> 00:42:21,741
this is what you
call trending, right?

00:42:21,741 --> 00:42:24,010
Mm-hmm.

00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:26,012
(chuckles)

00:42:26,012 --> 00:42:28,981
Let's go meet your mother.

00:42:28,981 --> 00:42:30,650
Yeah?
Yeah.
