00:08:55,113 --> 00:08:57,916
So I'll practice my curtsey on
the way to the elevator.

00:09:01,619 --> 00:09:03,154
I'm guessing this is
a first, Dave?

00:09:03,154 --> 00:09:05,290
Definitely my first
swizzle-stick.

00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:07,992
Looks like the maid came in
to clean up and got interrupted.

00:09:07,992 --> 00:09:12,463
Yeah, check out the table...
and the glasses.

00:09:12,463 --> 00:09:14,933
Can't tell if that's from
the party or the struggle.

00:09:14,933 --> 00:09:18,403
Her skirt's hiked up.

00:09:18,403 --> 00:09:20,471
Possible sexual assault.

00:09:21,539 --> 00:09:23,608
<i>Maybe she got jumped.</i>

00:09:23,608 --> 00:09:24,943
<i>Tried to get away.</i>

00:09:24,943 --> 00:09:26,611
(screams)

00:09:26,611 --> 00:09:30,982
The last thing a prince needs is
some hotel maid crying rape.

00:09:30,982 --> 00:09:34,152
She tried to take off,
and he just grabs

00:09:34,152 --> 00:09:36,621
the nearest weapon, and bam.

00:09:39,557 --> 00:09:41,659
And then he just leaves
her here,

00:09:41,659 --> 00:09:43,561
goes to the casino?

00:09:43,561 --> 00:09:45,897
Maybe in his kingdom,
he gets away with whatever

00:09:45,897 --> 00:09:47,632
he wants to, including murder.

00:10:01,212 --> 00:10:02,914
Got a problem?

00:10:02,914 --> 00:10:04,315
Yeah.

00:10:04,315 --> 00:10:05,950
Found the bullet

00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:09,053
that shattered the mayor's
martini glass.

00:10:09,053 --> 00:10:11,489
But I haven't been able
to find any other bullets.

00:10:11,489 --> 00:10:14,459
Probably find them in
the mayor, right?

00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:16,194
Well, yeah, but then
where's the blood?

00:10:16,194 --> 00:10:18,029
If you get shot, you bleed.

00:10:18,029 --> 00:10:20,264
That's a good point.

00:10:24,202 --> 00:10:27,572
Okay, we know four shots
came from my left.

00:10:27,572 --> 00:10:31,976
First one takes out
my martini.

00:10:31,976 --> 00:10:34,178
Next three are direct hits.

00:10:34,178 --> 00:10:35,647
(imitates "ping"
of bullet hits)

00:10:42,487 --> 00:10:45,890
You plan on staying down there
for a while?

00:10:47,091 --> 00:10:49,160
Can I see your flashlight
for a sec?

00:10:55,667 --> 00:10:57,368
Oh, yeah.

00:10:57,368 --> 00:10:58,369
I'm sorry. Glove?

00:11:01,606 --> 00:11:03,307
Thank you.

00:11:10,048 --> 00:11:11,482
Mushroomed bullet.

00:11:11,482 --> 00:11:13,051
There was no damage
to the podium.

00:11:13,051 --> 00:11:15,620
What else could it have hit?

00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,655
Another good point.

00:11:17,655 --> 00:11:20,525
Well, my obituary can wait.

00:11:20,525 --> 00:11:21,959
I made the front page.

00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:23,227
Both papers.

00:11:24,495 --> 00:11:26,497
Get this in a department store,
did you?

00:11:26,497 --> 00:11:28,232
I wouldn't wear
a store-made suit.

00:11:28,232 --> 00:11:29,634
I got a tailor

00:11:29,634 --> 00:11:31,602
in Bogota.
He's the greatest.

00:11:31,602 --> 00:11:33,337
This is a bullet-proof suit.

00:11:33,337 --> 00:11:35,640
Guess it comes with
a lifetime guarantee?

00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,176
Yeah. You get shot,
and they fix it for free.

00:11:43,181 --> 00:11:45,483
Is that one
of the bullets?

00:11:45,483 --> 00:11:47,552
Yeah. Looks like it.

00:11:50,488 --> 00:11:53,991
I've never seen
one of these before.

00:11:53,991 --> 00:11:56,060
So who are you afraid of?
I'm not afraid.

00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,361
I'm just prepared.

00:11:57,361 --> 00:11:59,497
Hell, I was the mayor
for 12 years

00:11:59,497 --> 00:12:01,099
and you don't get
everybody's vote.

00:12:01,099 --> 00:12:03,034
And in my old life, I
represented wiseguys

00:12:03,034 --> 00:12:04,902
who had legal trouble and
couldn't get all of them off.

00:12:04,902 --> 00:12:06,404
So you got a lot
of enemies, do you?

00:12:06,404 --> 00:12:09,207
Which is why I got to be
bulletproof, baby.

00:12:09,207 --> 00:12:10,942
And you got a lot
of work to do.

00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:17,582
(woman crying, sniffling)

00:12:25,623 --> 00:12:26,891
Hi.

00:12:28,092 --> 00:12:31,462
I'm CSI Brody.

00:12:31,462 --> 00:12:32,997
Are you okay, ma'am?

00:12:32,997 --> 00:12:36,300
No.

00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,536
Maria was my friend.

00:12:38,536 --> 00:12:41,005
We worked together
for six years.

00:12:41,005 --> 00:12:42,907
So you knew her well.

00:12:42,907 --> 00:12:44,342
I'm sorry.

00:12:44,342 --> 00:12:47,211
She was a good person.

00:12:47,211 --> 00:12:49,080
A kind person.

00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:52,283
Her husband lost his job.

00:12:52,283 --> 00:12:56,020
She was supporting him
and her four kids.

00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:59,590
Were you working on
this floor last night?

00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:02,426
Yes. Here.

00:13:02,426 --> 00:13:04,395
In this suite.

00:13:04,395 --> 00:13:06,063
So, did you
hear anything?

00:13:06,063 --> 00:13:07,465
A scream, a fight?

00:13:07,465 --> 00:13:11,202
No. It was too loud.

00:13:11,202 --> 00:13:13,037
The party.

00:13:13,037 --> 00:13:16,007
Did you see Maria go into the
suite during the party?

00:13:19,043 --> 00:13:20,912
Hey, it's okay.

00:13:20,912 --> 00:13:22,947
Don't be afraid.

00:13:22,947 --> 00:13:25,917
I just want to help
Maria's family.

00:13:25,917 --> 00:13:28,186
He was very demanding.

00:13:28,186 --> 00:13:29,420
The prince.

00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:33,291
He was here a lot.

00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:35,259
Same suite.

00:13:35,259 --> 00:13:37,228
He would always
ask for Maria.

00:13:37,228 --> 00:13:42,567
Some nights he would
even call her ten, 20 times.

00:13:42,567 --> 00:13:46,437
Did the prince ever make
inappropriate demands of Maria?

00:13:46,437 --> 00:13:48,940
She wouldn't say.

00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:51,209
She never complained.

00:13:51,209 --> 00:13:55,513
Like me, she was
just happy to have a job.

00:14:24,141 --> 00:14:27,078
♪ ♪

00:14:39,924 --> 00:14:41,525
Apparently, the prince
was no prince

00:14:41,525 --> 00:14:43,895
when it came to demanding
extra services from the maid.

00:14:43,895 --> 00:14:45,563
You mean of a sexual variety?

00:14:45,563 --> 00:14:47,131
Signs point that way.

00:14:47,131 --> 00:14:49,433
So does this camera
I just found.

00:14:49,433 --> 00:14:51,002
It was pointed
right at the bed.

00:14:51,002 --> 00:14:53,671
Somebody's been
taking home movies.

00:14:53,671 --> 00:14:56,574
And it's rigged to transmit
to a remote location.

00:14:56,574 --> 00:14:59,043
I'll run the serial number.

00:14:59,043 --> 00:15:01,045
See if I can get
some prints off of it.

00:15:01,045 --> 00:15:04,382
In the meantime, why don't
you print His Majesty.

00:15:04,382 --> 00:15:06,183
Find out what his deal is.

00:15:12,924 --> 00:15:16,060
I hear I almost had our mayor
on my table.

00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,662
Sorry, Doc, not his time.

00:15:17,662 --> 00:15:20,665
Don't be sorry;
I voted for him three times.

00:15:20,665 --> 00:15:22,566
Four, if you count his wife.

00:15:22,566 --> 00:15:24,435
He's done great things
for our town.

00:15:24,435 --> 00:15:27,071
Oh, I agree. Mostly.

00:15:27,071 --> 00:15:28,439
(chuckles)

00:15:28,439 --> 00:15:31,509
So I can guess C.O.D.--
gunshot wound to the nose.

00:15:31,509 --> 00:15:33,077
Anything else interesting?

00:15:33,077 --> 00:15:34,578
Yes.

00:15:36,914 --> 00:15:40,017
Sooting, stippling, lead smoke

00:15:40,017 --> 00:15:41,519
around the entry point.

00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,054
Shooter was less
than a foot away.

00:15:43,054 --> 00:15:44,655
So the guard almost caught him.

00:15:44,655 --> 00:15:47,158
Well, he definitely
caught a bullet.

00:15:47,158 --> 00:15:49,627
A .38, I presume.

00:15:49,627 --> 00:15:51,362
To match
my growing collection.

00:15:54,298 --> 00:15:55,366
Huh.

00:15:56,567 --> 00:15:59,470
Your .38 put on some weight.

00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:02,306
That looks like
a .44.

00:16:04,308 --> 00:16:06,243
Can't wait
to tell Ecklie.

00:16:06,243 --> 00:16:07,979
We've got three shooters.

00:16:13,117 --> 00:16:14,118
BRASS:
<i>So, Prince,</i>

00:16:14,118 --> 00:16:15,653
do you know this woman?

00:16:15,653 --> 00:16:17,355
No.

00:16:17,355 --> 00:16:21,158
She's a maid at your
hotel-- Maria Garza.

00:16:21,158 --> 00:16:23,561
All those messes you made,
she cleaned them up.

00:16:23,561 --> 00:16:25,563
And?

00:16:25,563 --> 00:16:26,964
And she's dead.

00:16:26,964 --> 00:16:28,432
What's that got to do with me?

00:16:28,432 --> 00:16:29,967
Her body was found
in your suite.

00:16:29,967 --> 00:16:31,435
Come on in.

00:16:31,435 --> 00:16:33,671
You're talking
about the hired help.

00:16:33,671 --> 00:16:36,507
Hotel security told me about the
little party you had last night.

00:16:36,507 --> 00:16:40,011
It was so good they had
to shut it down around 2:00 a.m.

00:16:40,011 --> 00:16:42,079
So where did you go
for the after party?

00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:43,547
The spa.

00:16:43,547 --> 00:16:45,616
And from there,
the casino.

00:16:45,616 --> 00:16:47,585
Which is where
you found me.
Ready, Captain.

00:16:47,585 --> 00:16:49,153
This is CSI Brody.

00:16:49,153 --> 00:16:52,056
I'm hired to take your prints
and DNA.

00:16:52,056 --> 00:16:55,493
Didn't I see you at the
Marquee Day Club yesterday?

00:16:56,594 --> 00:16:58,963
Yeah... topless.

00:16:58,963 --> 00:17:01,232
Remove your watch and jewelry.

00:17:01,232 --> 00:17:04,235
Do you have a male assistant?

00:17:05,936 --> 00:17:07,638
If it would make you
feel more comfortable,

00:17:07,638 --> 00:17:10,041
I'll let you give me a thousand
bucks when we're finished.

00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:29,326
Open up.

00:17:31,262 --> 00:17:33,898
I get paid by the hour.

00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,208
Excuse me.

00:17:47,645 --> 00:17:48,913
(knocks twice)

00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:53,617
Word is you like stories.

00:17:53,617 --> 00:17:55,219
I got a good one.

00:17:55,219 --> 00:17:57,288
I'm on the edge of my seat.

00:17:57,288 --> 00:17:58,889
.38 Colt dumped
at the museum

00:17:58,889 --> 00:18:01,425
is definitely the gun
that shot Oscar Goodman.

00:18:01,425 --> 00:18:04,395
Ran the test fires
through IBIS.

00:18:04,395 --> 00:18:06,297
Gun's connected to seven
prior shootings.

00:18:06,297 --> 00:18:08,099
And here's your
Mickey Spillane--

00:18:08,099 --> 00:18:10,468
All seven date back
to the '80s.

00:18:12,369 --> 00:18:14,338
Wow.

00:18:14,338 --> 00:18:16,640
Tough decade for
Italian surnames.

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,242
Will you excuse me
just a second?

00:18:18,242 --> 00:18:19,243
Greg!

00:18:19,243 --> 00:18:21,278
Tell me one more time,

00:18:21,278 --> 00:18:23,214
how do you pronounce your name?

00:18:23,214 --> 00:18:24,248
Xiomara.

00:18:24,248 --> 00:18:25,983
Xiomara.

00:18:25,983 --> 00:18:27,651
What did I do?

00:18:27,651 --> 00:18:29,920
Do you know any of these guys?

00:18:32,022 --> 00:18:35,092
Know 'em? It's like a who's who
of who's dead.

00:18:35,092 --> 00:18:37,294
Joey Scarlatta sold
Gedda his strip joint.

00:18:37,294 --> 00:18:39,497
Capped the day the deal closed.

00:18:39,497 --> 00:18:40,531
Vinnie "The Moose"
Moosetti.

00:18:40,531 --> 00:18:42,233
Gedda's mechanic.

00:18:42,233 --> 00:18:43,534
Until the brakes
were put on him.

00:18:43,534 --> 00:18:46,170
Tommy "Capicola" Cappiletti.
Butcher.

00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:47,972
Gedda's ex-brother-in-law...

00:18:47,972 --> 00:18:50,574
Yeah, I get it, I get it--
he was ex'd.

00:18:50,574 --> 00:18:52,576
Right?

00:18:52,576 --> 00:18:54,044
All seven shootings
went cold.

00:18:54,044 --> 00:18:55,446
Yeah, but that doesn't mean

00:18:55,446 --> 00:18:57,014
that everybody didn't know
who did them.

00:18:57,014 --> 00:19:00,017
It was Gedda's hit man
Vinnie Sapphire.

00:19:00,017 --> 00:19:01,285
All right, "Tru Crime"

00:19:01,285 --> 00:19:02,219
you know so much.

00:19:02,219 --> 00:19:04,021
What's his last known?

00:19:04,021 --> 00:19:05,456
Unknown.

00:19:05,456 --> 00:19:07,024
Sapphire's been missing
for the last 20 years.

00:19:07,024 --> 00:19:08,926
Yeah, well, his wife's not.

00:19:11,162 --> 00:19:13,063
I'll tell Brass.
Bring her in.

00:19:13,063 --> 00:19:14,165
Good work.

00:19:14,165 --> 00:19:15,099
Now go away.

00:19:18,569 --> 00:19:20,104
So, Brassy,
what's with the sit-down?

00:19:20,104 --> 00:19:21,438
You finally find Vinnie?

00:19:21,438 --> 00:19:24,408
No, but we found his gun.

00:19:24,408 --> 00:19:27,144
Oh. Well, he always liked
'em bright and shiny,

00:19:27,144 --> 00:19:28,646
just like his bimbos.

00:19:28,646 --> 00:19:32,082
Well, this bright and shiny
shot Oscar Goodman last night.

00:19:32,082 --> 00:19:34,652
I'm thinking maybe
Vinnie came home.
Well, if he came home,

00:19:34,652 --> 00:19:37,421
he didn't come home to me.

00:19:37,421 --> 00:19:39,023
But if there's anything

00:19:39,023 --> 00:19:40,591
that would bring Vinnie
back from the dead,

00:19:40,591 --> 00:19:42,593
it's Oscar Goodman's
Mob museum.

00:19:42,593 --> 00:19:46,197
No induction for Vinnie,
after all he did.

00:19:46,197 --> 00:19:47,598
That is a crime.

00:19:47,598 --> 00:19:50,568
And maybe motive to put
a couple holes in the mayor.

00:19:50,568 --> 00:19:52,136
But he had help.

00:19:52,136 --> 00:19:55,206
Well, don't look at me.
I like Oscar.

00:19:55,206 --> 00:19:56,407
(chuckling):
Yeah.

00:19:56,407 --> 00:19:58,075
I contributed
to his campaigns.

00:19:58,075 --> 00:19:59,610
Now, Vinnie,

00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:01,912
he felt different.

00:20:01,912 --> 00:20:03,948
And for good reason
if you remember.

00:20:03,948 --> 00:20:05,282
Oscar refused to rep him,

00:20:05,282 --> 00:20:07,585
even when Vinnie was
facing the needle.

00:20:07,585 --> 00:20:09,153
Gave him some BS excuse

00:20:09,153 --> 00:20:11,222
about looking for the good
in his clients

00:20:11,222 --> 00:20:12,890
and not seeing
any in Vinnie.

00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:14,491
I mean, what kind
of lawyer is that?

00:20:14,491 --> 00:20:15,926
You're right.

00:20:15,926 --> 00:20:18,262
Good guys don't need lawyers.

00:20:18,262 --> 00:20:20,030
What about you?

00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:23,334
Look, Vinnie bailed on me
and our marriage after 20 years.

00:20:23,334 --> 00:20:25,035
If he walked in this room
right now,

00:20:25,035 --> 00:20:26,570
I'd tell him the same thing
I'd tell you:

00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:27,671
to stuff it.

00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,675
I'll give you a tip.

00:20:31,675 --> 00:20:33,344
If that bastard

00:20:33,344 --> 00:20:34,545
needed help with anything

00:20:34,545 --> 00:20:36,580
like taking out the mayor,

00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,916
you should do what Vinnie
always did--

00:20:40,017 --> 00:20:43,254
look for a new piece of ass.

00:20:43,254 --> 00:20:46,390
I just never understood
how Vinnie could leave you.

00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:47,958
Well, that's because
you're a gentleman.

00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,629
Look, I got to get back
to my crap job.

00:20:54,932 --> 00:20:57,001
If you ever find yourself
in the vicinity

00:20:57,001 --> 00:21:01,405
of Tom's Bar on Corvell,
why don't you stop in?

00:21:01,405 --> 00:21:05,409
I'll refill that bottle of
whiskey you keep in your drawer.

00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:15,185
Hodges.
Hey.

00:21:15,185 --> 00:21:18,255
I have a 1979 Cadillac
Coupe De Ville.

00:21:18,255 --> 00:21:20,457
They used one of these in
the movie <i>Goodfellas.</i>

00:21:20,457 --> 00:21:22,559
This one starred in
circling the museum

00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,261
for about an hour
last night.

00:21:24,261 --> 00:21:25,963
Sam used to have one
just like it.

00:21:25,963 --> 00:21:28,565
I took my driving test in it.
Couldn't fail.

00:21:28,565 --> 00:21:30,100
I failed.

00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,402
Twice.

00:21:31,402 --> 00:21:33,604
Still get nightmares
about all those cones.

00:21:33,604 --> 00:21:38,042
So what about the tire
impressions in the alley?

00:21:38,042 --> 00:21:41,412
Well, here's where we enter
the world of oddfellas.

00:21:41,412 --> 00:21:43,180
Or, more precisely, Detroit.

00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:46,250
Tire impressions
were made by bias plies.

00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:50,521
Same specs as you would find in
factory tires on a '79 Caddy.

00:21:50,521 --> 00:21:53,357
Bet you can't guess what kind
of car Vinnie drove?

00:21:53,357 --> 00:21:56,360
A '79 Cadillac Coupe De Ville.

00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:00,097
HODGES:
I confirmed that with DMV.

00:22:00,097 --> 00:22:01,332
And...

00:22:03,467 --> 00:22:04,401
Plate's a match, too.

00:22:06,937 --> 00:22:09,073
Vinnie's car, Vinnie's gun...

00:22:09,073 --> 00:22:10,374
HODGES:
Vinnie's suit and hat.

00:22:10,374 --> 00:22:12,376
Vinnie's back.

00:22:17,448 --> 00:22:18,882
STOKES:
<i>Maria Garza's autopsy showed</i>

00:22:18,882 --> 00:22:20,017
showed no signs
of vaginal trauma.

00:22:20,017 --> 00:22:21,452
SAE kit was negative
for semen.

00:22:21,452 --> 00:22:23,087
Just because the prince
couldn't close the deal,

00:22:23,087 --> 00:22:24,121
doesn't mean
he didn't kill her.

00:22:24,121 --> 00:22:25,322
That's true.

00:22:25,322 --> 00:22:27,057
We're still processing
his clothes.

00:22:27,057 --> 00:22:29,093
Okay, well, I ran the serial
number on the lipstick cam.

00:22:29,093 --> 00:22:30,527
Came back to a store
in Henderson.

00:22:30,527 --> 00:22:32,129
Buyer paid cash.

00:22:32,129 --> 00:22:34,064
I was able to pull
some partials off of that.

00:22:34,064 --> 00:22:37,368
Andy's running it right now.

00:22:37,368 --> 00:22:38,969
My money's
on the prince.

00:22:38,969 --> 00:22:41,505
He gets one of his crew
to install the camera,

00:22:41,505 --> 00:22:44,041
that way, whatever
happens in Vegas

00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:45,376
doesn't have
to stay in Vegas.

00:22:45,376 --> 00:22:47,177
He can have movie night
at the palace.

00:22:47,177 --> 00:22:50,381
He really did
piss you off, didn't he?

00:22:50,381 --> 00:22:52,483
You know, there is another
way to look at this.

00:22:52,483 --> 00:22:54,918
That's a cheap
consumer camera,

00:22:54,918 --> 00:22:56,587
access to the suite
was easy.

00:22:56,587 --> 00:22:58,455
You said Maria's
husband was out of work.

00:22:58,455 --> 00:23:00,124
She was supporting
the family.

00:23:00,124 --> 00:23:02,960
Maybe Maria saw
an opportunity here.

00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,329
Gives the prince
even more motive.

00:23:05,329 --> 00:23:06,530
It gives us more
than that.

00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:08,132
If that camera recorded
the murder,

00:23:08,132 --> 00:23:10,234
we need to get our hands
on that video footage.

00:23:12,436 --> 00:23:13,537
You're hovering again.

00:23:13,537 --> 00:23:16,173
Oh. Yeah. Sorry.

00:23:16,173 --> 00:23:17,207
We both wore purple today.

00:23:17,207 --> 00:23:18,409
We're on the same page.

00:23:18,409 --> 00:23:20,177
Sweet talk never
works on me.

00:23:20,177 --> 00:23:21,912
I'm not so sweet.

00:23:21,912 --> 00:23:24,014
Oh, I like you.

00:23:29,253 --> 00:23:31,155
You may approach
the AFIS.

00:23:31,155 --> 00:23:32,222
Thank you.

00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:36,393
STOKES:
Matthew Lapaz, 22.

00:23:36,393 --> 00:23:38,195
Juvie record starts at 16.

00:23:38,195 --> 00:23:40,130
Priors for drug possession.

00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:41,598
Work card for
the Eclipse.

00:23:41,598 --> 00:23:43,600
BRODY: Stopped working there
three weeks ago.

00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,269
Guy had access to the hotel,

00:23:45,269 --> 00:23:47,004
that means he probably had
access to the suites.

00:23:47,004 --> 00:23:50,240
And we did find drug residue
in the prince's suite...

00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,443
Maybe Lapaz was there,
hooking him up.

00:23:52,443 --> 00:23:54,578
More than just drugs.

00:23:54,578 --> 00:23:56,180
So let's hook him up.

00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,915
So, Mr. Lapaz...

00:23:57,915 --> 00:23:59,416
you selling drugs
to royalty now?

00:23:59,416 --> 00:24:01,051
I don't sell drugs no more.

00:24:01,051 --> 00:24:02,386
What, did you move up
to electronics?

00:24:02,386 --> 00:24:05,255
We found your prints on
a hidden camera

00:24:05,255 --> 00:24:07,925
that was installed in
a suite at the Eclipse.

00:24:07,925 --> 00:24:10,093
It was, uh...
it was his suite.

00:24:11,495 --> 00:24:13,297
So, what, he hire you
to make some home movies?

00:24:13,297 --> 00:24:15,232
Some sex tapes?

00:24:15,232 --> 00:24:17,100
Or maybe you were
in the prince's suite

00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,469
helping the maid set him up.

00:24:20,137 --> 00:24:22,906
Well... either way,
Maria Garza's dead.

00:24:22,906 --> 00:24:25,676
I don't know nothin'...
about nothin'.

00:24:25,676 --> 00:24:28,312
Okay, we got guys going through
your place right now,

00:24:28,312 --> 00:24:30,214
and with all those
remote recordings you made

00:24:30,214 --> 00:24:32,115
with that lipstick cam,

00:24:32,115 --> 00:24:34,384
one of 'em's going to show
Maria Garza's murder.

00:24:36,353 --> 00:24:39,957
Hey, listen to me.

00:24:39,957 --> 00:24:41,525
Look at me.

00:24:41,525 --> 00:24:43,560
This is your last chance
to help yourself.

00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,996
I'm gonna let my lawyer help me.

00:24:48,465 --> 00:24:49,500
Hey. Thanks.

00:24:51,001 --> 00:24:52,236
Did you find
the two missing rounds

00:24:52,236 --> 00:24:53,537
from the guard's gun yet?

00:24:53,537 --> 00:24:55,372
Nope.

00:24:55,372 --> 00:24:57,040
I'm beginning to think
they're in the next county.

00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,942
Or in Vinnie Sapphire.

00:25:00,477 --> 00:25:01,945
All right. Okay.

00:25:01,945 --> 00:25:05,115
The only blood out here
is from the guard,

00:25:05,115 --> 00:25:07,217
who was shot in
the face with a .44.

00:25:07,217 --> 00:25:09,520
Two shooters inside had .38s.

00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,122
Maybe whoever was driving
Vinnie's getaway car

00:25:12,122 --> 00:25:14,391
was packing the .44.

00:25:14,391 --> 00:25:16,226
Guard shot the car twice.

00:25:16,226 --> 00:25:18,495
Okay.
That's interesting.

00:25:18,495 --> 00:25:21,465
Yeah. Do me a favor--
shoot me in the face.

00:25:21,465 --> 00:25:24,001
(scoffs)
What?

00:25:24,001 --> 00:25:25,469
Shoot me in the face--
pretend gun, you know.

00:25:25,469 --> 00:25:27,371
About a foot away,
and don't miss.

00:25:27,371 --> 00:25:28,372
You're the boss.

00:25:30,374 --> 00:25:31,642
Bang, bang, bang,
bang, bang!

00:25:31,642 --> 00:25:33,277
I wasn't even ready!
(laughs)

00:25:33,277 --> 00:25:34,645
That's the point.

00:25:34,645 --> 00:25:36,547
We're done here.
You can wrap it up.

00:25:36,547 --> 00:25:38,015
Bullets aren't out here.

00:25:38,015 --> 00:25:39,416
And they're not in
the next county,

00:25:39,416 --> 00:25:41,051
and they're not in
Vinnie Sapphire, either.

00:25:41,051 --> 00:25:42,486
Or in his car.

00:25:42,486 --> 00:25:43,487
Hey, thank you.

00:25:43,487 --> 00:25:45,422
That was fun.

00:25:45,422 --> 00:25:46,990
(scoffs)

00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:49,259
BRODY:
<i>What's up?</i>

00:25:49,259 --> 00:25:52,262
Hey. You won't believe
how organized Lapaz was.

00:25:52,262 --> 00:25:53,931
All the tapes from
the prince's room

00:25:53,931 --> 00:25:55,432
have time and date stamps,

00:25:55,432 --> 00:25:58,135
so I went right to 3:00 a.m.
the night of the murder...

00:25:58,135 --> 00:26:00,671
I get this.

00:26:00,671 --> 00:26:03,307
They the hell is the camera
focused on the night stand?

00:26:03,307 --> 00:26:04,675
So much for a sex tape.

00:26:04,675 --> 00:26:05,676
Yeah, right?

00:26:05,676 --> 00:26:07,544
Let's keep going.

00:26:10,247 --> 00:26:13,250
STOKES: It's a safe tape,
not a sex tape.

00:26:26,263 --> 00:26:29,199
My first year in L.A.,
I worked fraud cases.

00:26:29,199 --> 00:26:31,535
I learned the difference
between real and fake.

00:26:31,535 --> 00:26:33,604
A Rolez and a Rolex.
Mm-hmm.

00:26:33,604 --> 00:26:35,005
When I printed
the prince,

00:26:35,005 --> 00:26:36,673
I noticed he had on
a counterfeit watch.

00:26:36,673 --> 00:26:38,575
I just thought
he was cheap.

00:26:38,575 --> 00:26:41,445
So this wasn't about
sex tapes or extortion,

00:26:41,445 --> 00:26:42,913
he was being robbed.

00:26:42,913 --> 00:26:44,281
More like scammed.

00:26:44,281 --> 00:26:46,016
Lapaz and Garza worked
at the hotel together

00:26:46,016 --> 00:26:47,484
before they became
partners in crime.

00:26:47,484 --> 00:26:49,386
They installed the camera
to get the code from the safe,

00:26:49,386 --> 00:26:51,154
and then they swapped
the prince's bling

00:26:51,154 --> 00:26:53,123
with counterfeit.

00:26:53,123 --> 00:26:55,292
Who knows how many guests
they've been ripping off?

00:26:55,292 --> 00:26:58,161
Yeah, well, I think
I know one who got even.

00:26:58,161 --> 00:26:59,529
(loud, angry grunt)

00:27:00,597 --> 00:27:02,065
That's evidence.

00:27:02,065 --> 00:27:04,034
And that was a lot of anger.

00:27:04,034 --> 00:27:05,335
Until this moment, I had no idea

00:27:05,335 --> 00:27:07,237
anyone has stolen anything
from me.

00:27:07,237 --> 00:27:11,008
Even if I did, you really think
I'd kill a maid over a watch?

00:27:11,008 --> 00:27:12,209
Yes, I do.

00:27:12,209 --> 00:27:14,144
You know, we checked
your key card logs

00:27:14,144 --> 00:27:16,246
from the penthouse suite--

00:27:16,246 --> 00:27:18,582
you came back from
the spa at 2:52 a.m.

00:27:18,582 --> 00:27:21,184
That is four minutes
after Maria Garza the maid

00:27:21,184 --> 00:27:22,653
entered to clean it.

00:27:22,653 --> 00:27:26,189
So I came back to change before
going to the casino.

00:27:26,189 --> 00:27:28,925
I was there for
a minute, at most.

00:27:28,925 --> 00:27:30,027
The maid was
in the suite,

00:27:30,027 --> 00:27:31,294
maybe she was in
another room.

00:27:31,294 --> 00:27:33,430
I did not see her.

00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:34,965
I think you did.

00:27:36,466 --> 00:27:39,169
And I think you saw her hand
in the cookie jar,

00:27:39,169 --> 00:27:41,038
did something about it.

00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:43,140
What do you think
you're doing?

00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:46,076
Uh, I was just checking to see
that everything was okay.

00:27:46,076 --> 00:27:48,211
Just checking what...
(screaming)

00:27:53,583 --> 00:27:54,518
(Garza shrieks)

00:28:01,591 --> 00:28:03,460
I know you think I'm a pig...

00:28:06,063 --> 00:28:08,065
that I treat those that serve me
like dirt...

00:28:11,201 --> 00:28:13,336
...but I'd never take a life.

00:28:13,336 --> 00:28:16,373
And I'd never leave
anyone like this.

00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,478
Oh. Hey.

00:28:21,478 --> 00:28:23,046
Oh. Hey, boss.

00:28:23,046 --> 00:28:25,182
Got your results,
and another story.

00:28:25,182 --> 00:28:27,050
Let me go first
this time.

00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:31,455
So a museum security guard
fires two shots from a .38

00:28:31,455 --> 00:28:33,190
during an attempt
on a mayor.

00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:35,058
That guard's found later,
shot with a .44,

00:28:35,058 --> 00:28:36,927
outside in the alley.

00:28:36,927 --> 00:28:38,361
Now, the assumption is that
he engaged the bad guys,

00:28:38,361 --> 00:28:41,531
but CSIs don't find any
bullets outside.

00:28:41,531 --> 00:28:43,066
But they do find

00:28:43,066 --> 00:28:46,303
two unaccounted-for
.38 bullets inside.

00:28:46,303 --> 00:28:47,471
Accounted for now.

00:28:47,471 --> 00:28:48,972
Exactly.

00:28:48,972 --> 00:28:51,241
So the .38s in
the Gedda exhibit

00:28:51,241 --> 00:28:52,642
came from the guard's gun.

00:28:52,642 --> 00:28:53,910
Nicely done!

00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:55,445
I got there through
ballistics.

00:28:55,445 --> 00:28:56,446
How'd you get there?

00:28:56,446 --> 00:28:58,014
Uh, I shot Greg.

00:28:58,014 --> 00:28:59,116
I-I gotta go. Sorry.

00:28:59,116 --> 00:29:00,250
Thank you.
That was great.

00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:01,551
Hey, Catherine!
Catherine!

00:29:04,187 --> 00:29:05,956
RUSSELL:
So our security guard

00:29:05,956 --> 00:29:07,390
walks right up to the bad guy

00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:09,359
and lets himself
get shot in the face

00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:12,362
without returning fire, right?

00:29:12,362 --> 00:29:13,930
Now that tells me that
he knew the shooter,

00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:15,132
and it also tells me

00:29:15,132 --> 00:29:16,633
he was probably in on it
with Vinnie.

00:29:16,633 --> 00:29:19,002
Okay, so, while Vinnie was
shooting the mayor

00:29:19,002 --> 00:29:21,505
from over there,
the security guard

00:29:21,505 --> 00:29:23,373
got off two shots
from here,

00:29:23,373 --> 00:29:25,375
at an upward angle.

00:29:25,375 --> 00:29:28,411
The only thing he had
a prayer of hitting

00:29:28,411 --> 00:29:30,514
was Gedda or the ceiling.

00:29:30,514 --> 00:29:32,282
What was he aiming at?
It wasn't the mayor.

00:29:32,282 --> 00:29:33,950
Well, maybe he hit
what he was aiming at.

00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:35,385
Gedda?

00:29:35,385 --> 00:29:37,120
No... uh...

00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,624
two shots would dice up
all the safety glass.

00:29:40,624 --> 00:29:44,661
<i>I'm thinking maybe this whole</i>
<i>thing was a two-fer.</i>

00:29:44,661 --> 00:29:47,364
<i>You know, shoot he mayor and</i>
<i>shoot out the exhibit.</i>

00:29:47,364 --> 00:29:49,266
<i>Could be Vinnie or the guard</i>

00:29:49,266 --> 00:29:52,502
<i>wanted something inside here.</i>

00:29:52,502 --> 00:29:55,172
WILLOWS:
But what?

00:29:55,172 --> 00:29:57,407
Well, whatever it was...

00:29:57,407 --> 00:29:59,075
it was worth
a guard's life.

00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,081
STOKES: The prince
has a point.

00:30:05,081 --> 00:30:06,149
Why would he just
leave Garza

00:30:06,149 --> 00:30:07,350
laying on the floor
like that?

00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:08,451
Seems too smart.

00:30:08,451 --> 00:30:09,920
Well, if not him,
then who? Lapaz?

00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,254
He and Maria were
partners in crime.

00:30:11,254 --> 00:30:12,455
Maybe they had
a falling out.

00:30:12,455 --> 00:30:14,157
There's no sign of him
at the hotel.

00:30:14,157 --> 00:30:15,892
He's not on surveillance
or anything.

00:30:15,892 --> 00:30:17,394
Maybe we should
take another look.

00:30:17,394 --> 00:30:19,229
Maybe somebody stuck
around after the party,

00:30:19,229 --> 00:30:20,297
went after Maria.

00:30:33,143 --> 00:30:34,611
Can you believe
this guy?

00:30:34,611 --> 00:30:37,247
He had his list of special
requests put in writing.

00:30:37,247 --> 00:30:39,916
"Trash cans must be
emptied on the half-hour.

00:30:39,916 --> 00:30:42,552
"Dirty glasses must be
immediately removed
from the room.

00:30:42,552 --> 00:30:46,056
Dirty linens and towels must
be immediately replaced
with new ones."

00:30:46,056 --> 00:30:49,125
He wanted brand-new towels?
Or clean ones?

00:30:49,125 --> 00:30:50,627
What's the difference?

00:30:50,627 --> 00:30:55,265
Well... all the towels on
the cart here are brand-new.

00:30:57,434 --> 00:30:59,002
Grab me the ALS.
I want to show you something.

00:31:05,976 --> 00:31:08,378
These are towels
from the crime scene...

00:31:08,378 --> 00:31:11,581
and hotels put laundry marks
on all their new linens

00:31:11,581 --> 00:31:13,250
after their first wash.

00:31:14,317 --> 00:31:15,252
Let me see that.

00:31:20,924 --> 00:31:22,359
STOKES:
There it is-- you see that?

00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:24,361
Hm!

00:31:24,361 --> 00:31:27,530
So... towels from the crime
scene had been washed.

00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:29,366
They weren't brand-new.

00:31:29,366 --> 00:31:33,003
So, if these towels
weren't from Maria's cart,

00:31:33,003 --> 00:31:35,071
where did they come from?

00:31:35,071 --> 00:31:37,507
Ms. Vasquez, we checked
the inventory from your cart

00:31:37,507 --> 00:31:39,643
the night Maria
was killed.

00:31:39,643 --> 00:31:42,245
You reported that you were
four towels short.

00:31:42,245 --> 00:31:43,213
Is that right?

00:31:43,213 --> 00:31:44,614
People steal.

00:31:44,614 --> 00:31:46,983
Boy, don't I know it.

00:31:46,983 --> 00:31:50,921
So, tell me... was the safe
hard to open,

00:31:50,921 --> 00:31:54,090
or did you, uh... did you get it
on the first try?

00:31:56,092 --> 00:31:57,494
I haven't committed any crime.

00:31:57,494 --> 00:31:58,628
Oh, I beg to differ.

00:31:58,628 --> 00:32:00,196
Check the key card lock.

00:32:00,196 --> 00:32:01,631
I never went into
the prince's suite.

00:32:01,631 --> 00:32:04,200
We don't need to check
the key card lock.

00:32:08,071 --> 00:32:09,472
We searched your house.

00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:11,641
I don't think any of
that stuff belongs to you.

00:32:11,641 --> 00:32:14,210
STOKES: Eventually, we're
going to match it back

00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:15,912
to all the guests that you
and Matthew Lapaz

00:32:15,912 --> 00:32:17,447
have been ripping off.

00:32:17,447 --> 00:32:19,182
Still don't think you've
committed any crimes?

00:32:19,182 --> 00:32:21,451
How about burglary,
fraud and murder?

00:32:21,451 --> 00:32:23,586
So...

00:32:23,586 --> 00:32:25,188
why'd you kill Maria?

00:32:27,424 --> 00:32:29,526
Paula, you're going to prison.

00:32:31,428 --> 00:32:35,532
A little truth might shave off
a few years from the sentence.

00:32:42,105 --> 00:32:43,640
The door was open.

00:32:46,977 --> 00:32:49,879
I waited till Maria went into
the other bedroom.

00:32:51,314 --> 00:32:53,383
Then I went into the safe.

00:32:56,086 --> 00:32:58,388
(speaking Spanish)

00:32:58,388 --> 00:33:00,090
VASQUEZ:
<i>I told Maria we'd cut her in.</i>

00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:02,292
<i>But she said</i>
<i>that she was no thief.</i>

00:33:02,292 --> 00:33:04,094
She said that she
was going to speak

00:33:04,094 --> 00:33:06,463
to the Head of Housekeeping.

00:33:06,463 --> 00:33:07,998
STOKES:
Go on.

00:33:07,998 --> 00:33:09,366
Don't stop now.
Tell us what happened.

00:33:12,502 --> 00:33:14,371
No! (screams)

00:33:14,371 --> 00:33:15,905
Get off of me!

00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:18,575
(Garza shrieks)

00:33:23,646 --> 00:33:27,384
I clean after people every day.

00:33:27,384 --> 00:33:30,487
The rich-- they don't see me.

00:33:30,487 --> 00:33:32,122
They don't thank me.

00:33:32,122 --> 00:33:35,525
They only leave nothing
but their garbage.

00:33:35,525 --> 00:33:39,396
The prince, with all his money,
all his lawyers--

00:33:39,396 --> 00:33:41,664
he has people to
take care of him.

00:33:41,664 --> 00:33:45,902
I have no one
to take care of me.

00:33:45,902 --> 00:33:49,139
I have to take care of myself.

00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,908
What about Maria?

00:33:51,908 --> 00:33:53,576
You said her husband
was out of work,

00:33:53,576 --> 00:33:57,247
that she was supporting
her four kids.

00:33:57,247 --> 00:33:59,015
Who's going to take care
of them?

00:34:06,322 --> 00:34:08,458
ECKLIE:
The guard got himself
killed over this?

00:34:08,458 --> 00:34:10,260
An old journal?

00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:12,429
The journal's the only thing
missing from the Gedda exhibit.

00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:13,596
A mobster
who journals--

00:34:13,596 --> 00:34:15,398
that's great
for law enforcement.

00:34:15,398 --> 00:34:17,534
Well, it's mostly blank,
except for the last two pages.

00:34:17,534 --> 00:34:19,469
Which aren't exactly
"Dear Diary" entries.

00:34:19,469 --> 00:34:21,404
ECKLIE:
Yeah, what are they?
A to-do list.

00:34:21,404 --> 00:34:24,441
"Do," as in "whack."

00:34:24,441 --> 00:34:26,476
I assume a check
means "done"?

00:34:26,476 --> 00:34:28,545
Dead or presumed dead. Yeah.

00:34:28,545 --> 00:34:30,447
All right, so Vinnie Sapphire
comes back to town,

00:34:30,447 --> 00:34:32,315
shoots Oscar Goodman
to settle a score,

00:34:32,315 --> 00:34:34,551
and then steals
Gedda's hit list. Why?

00:34:34,551 --> 00:34:35,919
He was Gedda's
hit man.

00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:37,287
He knows all their names.

00:34:37,287 --> 00:34:38,521
All except
the last one here.

00:34:38,521 --> 00:34:41,391
Cesare Mastrantonio.

00:34:41,391 --> 00:34:43,560
Yeah. No birth certificate.
Guy never existed.

00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,562
What's he doing
on a hit list?

00:34:45,562 --> 00:34:47,297
(phone ringing)

00:34:47,297 --> 00:34:49,566
Yeah. Now what?

00:34:49,566 --> 00:34:51,367
Yeah.

00:34:51,367 --> 00:34:52,902
Good work, Jim.

00:34:52,902 --> 00:34:55,472
Brass found
Vinnie Sapphire's car

00:34:55,472 --> 00:34:57,373
at a motel off Boulder Highway.

00:35:01,978 --> 00:35:03,513
Okay, back up.

00:35:11,221 --> 00:35:13,089
Oh, man.

00:35:14,557 --> 00:35:15,925
Hat on the bed,

00:35:15,925 --> 00:35:17,360
always bad luck.

00:35:19,262 --> 00:35:20,930
All clear, Catherine.

00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:22,465
I got a female DB,

00:35:22,465 --> 00:35:23,500
and it ain't Vinnie.

00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:29,072
.44.

00:35:30,406 --> 00:35:32,108
Same caliber as the
security guard.

00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:37,080
Here's why no one
heard a shot.

00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,549
This looks
like the suit

00:35:39,549 --> 00:35:41,484
that was circling
the museum in the Caddie.

00:35:41,484 --> 00:35:43,119
I got an I.D.

00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:45,522
Monique Roberts.

00:35:45,522 --> 00:35:47,624
Monique Roberts?

00:35:47,624 --> 00:35:51,027
I knew her.
She was a friend of Sam's.

00:35:51,027 --> 00:35:53,129
Friend of a lot
of his friends.

00:35:53,129 --> 00:35:54,330
Well, if she was
with Vinnie,

00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:56,065
maybe she was on
the lam with him.

00:35:56,065 --> 00:35:59,202
And if that's her .44, maybe she
was the getaway driver.

00:36:00,603 --> 00:36:02,405
Got something
for me, baby?
Always.

00:36:02,405 --> 00:36:03,973
I got to get back inside.

00:36:03,973 --> 00:36:05,175
Thanks for the memoirs.

00:36:06,509 --> 00:36:08,111
Well, Vinnie
obviously wanted us

00:36:08,111 --> 00:36:09,979
chasing the wrong Vinnie--
the girl Vinnie.

00:36:09,979 --> 00:36:12,248
If we caught her, we
wouldn't catch him.

00:36:12,248 --> 00:36:14,384
Well, he caught her
for us.

00:36:14,384 --> 00:36:16,386
Well, looks like Vinnie
left in a hurry.

00:36:16,386 --> 00:36:20,023
Left his suits, his car
and his girlfriend.

00:36:20,023 --> 00:36:21,224
Yeah.
I don't see Gedda's journal.

00:36:21,224 --> 00:36:22,592
No journal,
no Vinnie.

00:36:22,592 --> 00:36:24,294
Yeah, I'm getting
a little sick and tired

00:36:24,294 --> 00:36:26,329
of this clown being two steps
ahead of us.

00:36:36,906 --> 00:36:38,575
These belong to you.

00:36:38,575 --> 00:36:41,144
Understand you caught
the person responsible

00:36:41,144 --> 00:36:43,012
for the housekeeper's murder.

00:36:43,012 --> 00:36:44,247
That's right.

00:36:44,247 --> 00:36:46,449
This...

00:36:46,449 --> 00:36:48,885
woman, Maria Garza.

00:36:51,387 --> 00:36:53,590
She lost her life for this.

00:36:58,061 --> 00:37:00,663
Someone with nothing
gave everything...

00:37:00,663 --> 00:37:03,066
for me.

00:37:08,304 --> 00:37:10,974
Please give this to her family.

00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,502
Greg!

00:37:42,338 --> 00:37:44,307
Yeah.
Hi.

00:37:44,307 --> 00:37:46,476
So Cesare Mastrantonio--

00:37:46,476 --> 00:37:48,211
he's on a hit list.

00:37:48,211 --> 00:37:50,480
But he's never existed--
no birth certificate.

00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,081
Right.

00:37:52,081 --> 00:37:54,550
So he never lived,
but he's dead.

00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:57,553
Did you check
for a death certificate?

00:37:57,553 --> 00:37:59,956
No. Why would we?

00:37:59,956 --> 00:38:01,891
Well, I'm just thinking
that if he has one,

00:38:01,891 --> 00:38:03,359
maybe we can find out
where he's buried,

00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:05,461
and then pay our respects.

00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:08,998
SANDERS:
Really?

00:38:08,998 --> 00:38:11,100
You had to stop
at the crematory flower shop?

00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,669
They're for my wife.

00:38:12,669 --> 00:38:14,137
Shouldn't we call Brass?

00:38:14,137 --> 00:38:16,072
No. We're just a
couple of mourners

00:38:16,072 --> 00:38:17,640
out for a nice stroll.

00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,575
(glass shattering)

00:38:19,575 --> 00:38:22,312
(woman whimpering)

00:38:22,312 --> 00:38:24,614
(yelling and grunting)

00:38:30,153 --> 00:38:32,221
(screaming sobs)

00:38:38,461 --> 00:38:40,063
Uh, Mrs. Sapphire?

00:38:40,063 --> 00:38:43,032
Vinnie, that son of a bitch!

00:38:43,032 --> 00:38:44,200
(wailing sob)

00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,035
Okay, all right.
Come on. Calm down.

00:38:46,035 --> 00:38:48,104
Come on. Take a... just
take some deep breaths.

00:38:48,104 --> 00:38:50,940
Take some deep...
He was always
such a disappointment.

00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:52,909
Okay. All right.
Hold still.

00:38:52,909 --> 00:38:55,445
You have a feather here.

00:38:55,445 --> 00:38:56,612
Feel all right? Huh?

00:38:56,612 --> 00:38:58,214
Do you...
do you want Greg...

00:38:58,214 --> 00:39:00,917
Greg to get you a glass
of water or something?

00:39:02,618 --> 00:39:05,288
I need something stiffer
than a glass of water.

00:39:05,288 --> 00:39:07,256
Okay. All right.

00:39:07,256 --> 00:39:08,991
JOANNA:
Get my purse.

00:39:08,991 --> 00:39:11,027
RUSSELL:
Get her purse for her.

00:39:15,598 --> 00:39:18,101
(sighs)

00:39:18,101 --> 00:39:20,436
Found your fingerprints
in the motel.

00:39:20,436 --> 00:39:22,905
GSR on your hands.

00:39:24,474 --> 00:39:26,409
And a feather
in your hair.

00:39:29,445 --> 00:39:31,214
Why did you kill
her, Joanna?

00:39:31,214 --> 00:39:33,149
(sniffles)

00:39:37,153 --> 00:39:40,656
When Vinnie got pinched,
he said, "Don't worry.

00:39:40,656 --> 00:39:43,025
Oscar will get me off."

00:39:43,025 --> 00:39:46,028
Well, that didn't happen.

00:39:46,028 --> 00:39:49,966
So when he ran,
he said, "Don't worry.

00:39:49,966 --> 00:39:51,367
There's plenty of money."

00:39:51,367 --> 00:39:53,970
Yeah, there was.

00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:58,508
In his suitcase, next to him,
on the lap of that bimbo

00:39:58,508 --> 00:40:00,510
as his Coupe de Ville
flew the coop.

00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:02,245
So you got her back.

00:40:02,245 --> 00:40:03,546
Did you get Vinnie back, too?

00:40:03,546 --> 00:40:05,448
No.

00:40:07,083 --> 00:40:08,584
God whacked Vinnie.

00:40:08,584 --> 00:40:11,053
About five months ago,
I get a call

00:40:11,053 --> 00:40:14,357
from this bimbo, Monique.

00:40:14,357 --> 00:40:16,559
Hadn't talked to the bitch
in 20 years,

00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:18,227
but she calls me,

00:40:18,227 --> 00:40:21,164
and she says that Vinnie
just died of cancer.

00:40:22,532 --> 00:40:25,134
She tossed his body
into Lake Mead

00:40:25,134 --> 00:40:27,503
because she couldn't
afford a funeral.

00:40:27,503 --> 00:40:28,604
She was broke.

00:40:28,604 --> 00:40:30,239
She figured
I'd be broke, too.

00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:33,209
So that's when I got into bed
with the bitch.

00:40:34,644 --> 00:40:36,512
So, on his deathbed,
Vinnie tells Monique,

00:40:36,512 --> 00:40:38,014
the... the mistress,

00:40:38,014 --> 00:40:39,649
all about Lou Gedda's
stash of cash--

00:40:39,649 --> 00:40:41,984
his rainy-day fund.

00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:43,953
And tells her
how to find it?

00:40:43,953 --> 00:40:45,655
Yeah, the last name
on the hit list, right?

00:40:45,655 --> 00:40:47,657
But, of course, that list
has been buried

00:40:47,657 --> 00:40:49,659
in the police
evidence vault

00:40:49,659 --> 00:40:51,093
for, like, years.

00:40:51,093 --> 00:40:52,261
Until Oscar got it
out of evidence

00:40:52,261 --> 00:40:53,529
and put it in the museum.

00:40:53,529 --> 00:40:55,198
And it goes from
being behind bars

00:40:55,198 --> 00:40:56,999
to being behind glass.

00:40:56,999 --> 00:40:58,468
So Joanna starts
fishing around

00:40:58,468 --> 00:41:00,203
for an invite
to the museum,

00:41:00,203 --> 00:41:02,171
while Monique starts
coming on to the guard.

00:41:02,171 --> 00:41:04,040
And that poor guy,
he had no idea

00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:06,042
that they were thinking
about killing the mayor.

00:41:06,042 --> 00:41:07,577
He was just in it for the money.

00:41:07,577 --> 00:41:09,912
The wife told you all this
at the mausoleum?

00:41:09,912 --> 00:41:13,182
She was in a...
pretty vulnerable state.

00:41:13,182 --> 00:41:14,617
Why make the
move on Oscar?

00:41:14,617 --> 00:41:17,653
'Cause he ruined
my marriage.

00:41:17,653 --> 00:41:19,288
You know, Vinnie
was a good earner.

00:41:19,288 --> 00:41:21,891
If Oscar had taken the case,

00:41:21,891 --> 00:41:24,227
he'd have got Vinnie off,

00:41:24,227 --> 00:41:26,429
and he wouldn't have run off
with his goomar.

00:41:27,897 --> 00:41:31,033
So Oscar got what he deserved.

00:41:31,033 --> 00:41:32,935
Almost.

00:41:32,935 --> 00:41:35,171
GOODMAN:
And with that, I want everyone
to take their glass,

00:41:35,171 --> 00:41:37,540
raise it high,
and we'll say, "Salud"!

00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:41,043
(gunfire, people screaming)

00:41:43,045 --> 00:41:45,281
Damn suit.

00:41:45,281 --> 00:41:48,084
ECKLIE:
<i>Did she happen to explain</i>

00:41:48,084 --> 00:41:49,452
why Monique was
running around

00:41:49,452 --> 00:41:51,153
wearing Vinnie's
clothes?

00:41:51,153 --> 00:41:53,322
Same reason why they got his car
and gun out of mothballs.

00:41:53,322 --> 00:41:54,924
They were setting him up.

00:41:54,924 --> 00:41:56,192
To quote the wife,

00:41:56,192 --> 00:41:58,594
"The perfect fall guy
is a dead guy."

00:41:58,594 --> 00:42:00,229
I mean, that's brilliant.

00:42:00,229 --> 00:42:03,032
Well, we sure as hell
fell for it.

00:42:03,032 --> 00:42:05,234
So what happened
to Gedda's stash of cash?

00:42:05,234 --> 00:42:06,502
Kind of hard to say,

00:42:06,502 --> 00:42:08,638
but the previous manager
of the mortuary

00:42:08,638 --> 00:42:12,942
retired about five years ago
to a villa in St. Barts.

00:42:12,942 --> 00:42:14,243
So I'm thinking...

00:42:14,243 --> 00:42:15,545
Mr. Mayor.

00:42:15,545 --> 00:42:17,113
Yes.

00:42:17,113 --> 00:42:18,981
Can I help you?
I'm going to see my client.

00:42:18,981 --> 00:42:20,349
Your client?
Who's... who's that?

00:42:20,349 --> 00:42:21,450
Joanna.

00:42:23,519 --> 00:42:25,388
But, Your Honor,
she tried to kill you.

00:42:25,388 --> 00:42:26,422
I know.

00:42:26,422 --> 00:42:28,124
Sir, she tried
to kill you.

00:42:28,124 --> 00:42:31,027
I know, but she's entitled
to a defense, isn't she?

00:42:31,027 --> 00:42:32,028
This is America.

00:42:36,432 --> 00:42:39,302
If I ever get in trouble,
I want that guy defending me.

00:42:39,302 --> 00:42:42,038
If I ever get in trouble,
I want his suit.
