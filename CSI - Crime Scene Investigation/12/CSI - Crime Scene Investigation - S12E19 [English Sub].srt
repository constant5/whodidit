Heading to the elevators.

to get caught. (laughs)

00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:22,997
you <i>have</i> caught him, right?
We're working on it.

00:05:22,997 --> 00:05:26,367
The detectives will
have more questions,

00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:29,370
so please don't
go anywhere.
Don't worry about me, hon.

00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,373

Cash, credit cards

00:05:45,119 --> 00:05:46,454
are missing.

00:05:46,454 --> 00:05:49,290
But they left a license;
that was nice.

00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:50,524
Dennis Kiel,

00:05:50,524 --> 00:05:52,526
58 from Los Angeles.

00:05:52,526 --> 00:05:54,128
Medical I.D.

00:05:54,128 --> 00:05:56,530
He was a doctor.

00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:59,366
And he has a family.
I'll have Sara

00:05:59,366 --> 00:06:02,136
check with the hotel,
see if they're registered.

00:06:02,136 --> 00:06:06,273
Roll him?
Yep.

00:06:06,273 --> 00:06:08,509
PHILLIPS:
Single GSW to the chest.

00:06:08,509 --> 00:06:11,545
There was no exit wound, so the
bullet's still inside him.

00:06:11,545 --> 00:06:15,216
Black Lung Betty over there said
that she heard <i>two</i> shots.

00:06:15,216 --> 00:06:17,218
RUSSELL:
So there's another bullet

00:06:17,218 --> 00:06:20,154
still out there.
Yeah. She also said
the assailant had a bloody nose.

00:06:20,154 --> 00:06:23,591
Maybe the victim got a lick in.

00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:27,161
FINLAY:
Ah, that would explain the blood
right over there.

00:06:28,195 --> 00:06:31,031
Yep, gravitational drops.

00:06:33,767 --> 00:06:35,569
RUSSELL:
All right, it's too far away

00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:37,571
from our victim to be his.
Yeah.

00:06:37,571 --> 00:06:39,573
Okay, so...

00:06:39,573 --> 00:06:43,010
our shooter pulls
a gun on our victim.

00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:45,012
Give me your money.

00:06:45,012 --> 00:06:48,015
(gunshot)

00:06:48,015 --> 00:06:49,517
You punch me in the nose.

00:06:51,118 --> 00:06:54,388
Head jerks back,
my gun goes up...

00:06:54,388 --> 00:06:57,558
Look at that.

00:06:57,558 --> 00:07:02,496
One shot in the doctor,
one shot in the slot machine.

00:07:02,496 --> 00:07:04,598
Think I should wrap it up
and take it back to the lab?

00:07:04,598 --> 00:07:06,600
Took the words right out
of my mouth, smart-ass.

00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,602
I'll go clear it
with the casino.

00:07:08,602 --> 00:07:11,171
Unbelievable.

00:07:13,274 --> 00:07:15,643
So, how many
more rooms to go?

00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:17,678
Oh, only 1,200.

00:07:21,248 --> 00:07:24,151

LVPD?

00:07:24,151 --> 00:07:26,554

Oh, that's
hilarious.

00:07:26,554 --> 00:07:28,489
It's about time
you show... Oh!

00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:30,558
Whoa.

00:07:30,558 --> 00:07:33,160
How you doing?
Fine.

00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,162
(Brody clears throat loudly)
Uh, y...

00:07:35,162 --> 00:07:37,164
We're, uh, we're
looking for a man.

00:07:37,164 --> 00:07:40,167
Uh, me, too.
This man.

00:07:40,167 --> 00:07:42,570
That's him-- I've been
waiting for him for hours.

00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:46,607
Yeah? Well, you might be waiting
a little bit longer than that.

00:07:46,607 --> 00:07:48,576
He just shot a guy
in the casino.

00:07:48,576 --> 00:07:50,177
What?

00:07:50,177 --> 00:07:52,346
I met him in
the casino bar
last night.

00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:54,582
He was cute;
perfect gentleman.

00:07:54,582 --> 00:07:56,417
Until later.

00:07:56,417 --> 00:07:59,186
Which is what
you want, right?

00:07:59,186 --> 00:08:00,487
(quiet sigh)

00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:03,591
Did he use
protection?

00:08:03,591 --> 00:08:05,192
Yeah. Why?

00:08:05,192 --> 00:08:07,194
Means we got DNA.

00:08:07,194 --> 00:08:08,429
BRODY:
And...

00:08:08,429 --> 00:08:11,432
he left behind a wrapper.

00:08:11,432 --> 00:08:13,233
BRODY:
Maybe a print.

00:08:13,233 --> 00:08:15,235
Did this perfect gentleman
have a name?

00:08:15,235 --> 00:08:17,237
Kind of. Called
himself X-Man.

00:08:17,237 --> 00:08:20,674
(laughs) Pretty cool.
Kind of <i>9√ Weeks,</i>

00:08:20,674 --> 00:08:22,242
foreign identity.

00:08:22,242 --> 00:08:24,244
Why are you taking my sheets?

00:08:24,244 --> 00:08:25,679
Why do you think?

00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:27,681
Oh.

00:08:27,681 --> 00:08:29,383
I hope you don't
think I'm a slut.

00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:31,685
I mean, I am not a slut.
No, no, of course not.

00:08:31,685 --> 00:08:34,288
Did X-Man leave anything else
behind we should know about?

00:08:34,288 --> 00:08:36,223
Well, I...

00:08:36,223 --> 00:08:39,660
I kind of made a video.

00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:43,063
We're gonna...
kind of need to watch that.

00:08:45,299 --> 00:08:48,535

BRASS:

Avery Kiel.

00:09:12,192 --> 00:09:14,461
My mom...

00:09:14,461 --> 00:09:16,664
she died last year.

00:09:17,698 --> 00:09:19,667
Where's my dad?

00:09:22,036 --> 00:09:24,038
What happened?

00:09:25,372 --> 00:09:29,009
Somebody robbed
your dad, Avery.

00:09:29,009 --> 00:09:30,277
Where?

00:09:30,277 --> 00:09:31,645
In the casino.

00:09:33,013 --> 00:09:35,015
This is my fault.

00:09:35,015 --> 00:09:38,519
I begged Dad to come out
this weekend to see Kanye.

00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:40,287
Last night...

00:09:40,287 --> 00:09:41,622
after he won all that money,

00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:43,390
I told him to be careful.

00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,591
What money, Avery?

00:09:44,591 --> 00:09:46,493
At the slot machines.

00:09:46,493 --> 00:09:49,329
He won, like, 800 bucks.

00:09:49,329 --> 00:09:51,231
All these people
were watching.

00:09:51,231 --> 00:09:54,334
So, after your dad
won all the money,

00:09:54,334 --> 00:09:57,037
did these people
follow him anywhere?

00:09:57,037 --> 00:09:58,272
No.

00:09:58,272 --> 00:10:01,108
I mean... I-I don't know.

00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:05,713
He bought those sneakers

00:10:05,713 --> 00:10:07,114
for me.

00:10:07,114 --> 00:10:10,384
He was always
buying me things.

00:10:10,384 --> 00:10:12,653
Is that your dad's computer?

00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:14,288
Yeah.

00:10:14,288 --> 00:10:16,557
We're gonna need to
take it with us, okay?

00:10:16,557 --> 00:10:18,559
BRASS:
Avery, do you have

00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:21,195
any relatives who live nearby,
you know, an aunt

00:10:21,195 --> 00:10:22,596
or an uncle, anybody?

00:10:22,596 --> 00:10:24,765
I have cousins in Wisconsin.

00:10:24,765 --> 00:10:27,201
I haven't seen them
in, like, forever.

00:10:29,036 --> 00:10:31,071
What's gonna happen to me?

00:10:31,071 --> 00:10:33,507
You'll be okay.

00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:35,609
We're gonna
keep you safe.

00:10:35,609 --> 00:10:38,679
This officer here is gonna
stay with you, okay?

00:10:43,751 --> 00:10:47,354
I'm gonna come back
and check in on you
in a little while,

00:10:47,354 --> 00:10:49,356
all right?

00:10:49,356 --> 00:10:51,725
I promise.

00:10:54,995 --> 00:10:57,431
Hey, Doc, what
you got?

00:10:57,431 --> 00:10:59,366
A bit of a puzzle.

00:10:59,366 --> 00:11:02,503
Our victim sustained a single
GSW to the center torso.

00:11:02,503 --> 00:11:07,508
Bullet entered the abdomen,
penetrated the liver.

00:11:07,508 --> 00:11:10,577
Does that look like
a penetrating wound to you?

00:11:10,577 --> 00:11:13,080
Looks like chopped
liver to me.

00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,549
I found these lead fragments

00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:18,085
and this copper jacket.

00:11:18,085 --> 00:11:19,987
Looks like a .38 hollow-point.

00:11:19,987 --> 00:11:21,655
In most cases,
when you find only the jacket,

00:11:21,655 --> 00:11:25,192
it means the core had separated.

00:11:25,192 --> 00:11:27,094
I didn't find any core.

00:11:27,094 --> 00:11:28,996
All I found was this.

00:11:32,199 --> 00:11:34,101
That is weird.

00:11:34,101 --> 00:11:35,702
Hourglass shape.

00:11:35,702 --> 00:11:37,104
Never seen that before.

00:11:37,104 --> 00:11:38,705
Interesting.

How's it going?
Having fun?

00:12:24,518 --> 00:12:26,286
You know how I like
to break things.

00:12:26,286 --> 00:12:30,424
So far, I've only found
the jacket of a hollow-point.

00:12:30,424 --> 00:12:31,658
No core, right?

00:12:31,658 --> 00:12:33,427
I hate it when you do that.

00:12:33,427 --> 00:12:37,731
Did you find a little red thing,
hourglass shape?

00:12:37,731 --> 00:12:39,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,101
I found that.

00:12:41,101 --> 00:12:42,302
I'm looking at it right now.

00:12:42,302 --> 00:12:43,503
Well, go ahead and bindle it.

00:12:43,503 --> 00:12:44,705
I got a feeling

00:12:44,705 --> 00:12:46,106
that's all you're going to find.

00:12:46,106 --> 00:12:47,407
What is it?

00:12:47,407 --> 00:12:48,775
No idea, Jules.
That's your next job.

00:12:48,775 --> 00:12:51,011
So annoying.

00:12:57,451 --> 00:12:59,286
Yeah, yeah.

00:12:59,286 --> 00:13:01,121
We're with the Crime Lab,
and we're looking for this guy.

00:13:01,121 --> 00:13:02,322
You seen him around?

00:13:02,322 --> 00:13:03,724
Um, no.

00:13:03,724 --> 00:13:06,159
Never seen him before.

00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:09,296
You mind if we come in
and take a look around?

00:13:09,296 --> 00:13:10,731
Yeah, I do mind.

00:13:10,731 --> 00:13:13,734
That wasn't really a question.

00:13:13,734 --> 00:13:16,370
This is hotel property;
we have the authority.

00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:17,638
Step aside.

00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:33,086
Size 13s?

00:13:33,086 --> 00:13:34,688
You look like you're
no more than a ten, tops.

00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:36,757
Who's your roommate?

00:13:36,757 --> 00:13:39,626
He's a friend from back home.

00:13:39,626 --> 00:13:42,362
You got some I.D.
on you, bud?

00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:51,371
Lee Jacobs.
Hey.

00:13:52,539 --> 00:13:54,074
Familiar?

00:13:56,343 --> 00:13:58,211
What?
I didn't do anything wrong.

00:13:58,211 --> 00:14:00,047
STOKES:
Need a little backup
in here, Paul.

00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:03,083
Check him for weapons.

00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:05,552
We're looking for your roomie,
Jordan Brentson.

00:14:05,552 --> 00:14:06,753
Yeah, well, he's not here.

00:14:06,753 --> 00:14:08,155
He took off.

00:14:08,155 --> 00:14:10,290
Without his shoes
and his wallet?

00:14:17,631 --> 00:14:19,166
You're coming downtown with us.

00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:20,534
Why don't you grab a jacket.

00:14:20,534 --> 00:14:22,336
Yeah, well, you know,
I know my rights.

00:14:22,336 --> 00:14:24,338
Anything in plain sight,
you don't need a warrant.

00:14:24,338 --> 00:14:26,340
If you that closet opened,
then you should open it.

00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,541
You a lawyer?

00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:29,276
No.

00:14:29,276 --> 00:14:31,545
Well, you're gonna need
a good one, serving 15 to 20.

00:14:34,448 --> 00:14:37,517
Okay. I'll get a jacket.

00:14:37,517 --> 00:14:38,986
Wait, hang on a second.

00:14:42,189 --> 00:14:44,558
Open it.

00:14:49,129 --> 00:14:52,165
If this is about the bar fight
in Ashtabula, dude hit me first.

00:14:52,165 --> 00:14:54,201
Get your ass out of there.

00:14:54,201 --> 00:14:56,103
Take a nice picture, Jordan.

00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:59,740
That might look like me,
but that's not me.

00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:02,642
Look, the guy's got a gun.

00:15:02,642 --> 00:15:04,978
I'm opposed to guns, the
whole Second Amendment thing.

00:15:04,978 --> 00:15:06,480
That's you, Jordan.

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,715
Your girlfriend Shelley--
she already gave you away, man.

00:15:08,715 --> 00:15:10,117
Who's Shelley?

00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:12,285
Really?

00:15:12,285 --> 00:15:14,287
Let me show you something.

00:15:18,992 --> 00:15:21,061
(chuckles)

00:15:21,061 --> 00:15:23,096
I want to get this on record.

00:15:23,096 --> 00:15:26,533
Say, "This is not
a one-night stand."

00:15:28,568 --> 00:15:31,304
This is not a
one-night stand.

00:15:31,304 --> 00:15:33,073
(giggling)

00:15:33,073 --> 00:15:34,274
No, no, no!

00:15:34,274 --> 00:15:37,044
Now say, "I promise
to take Shelley

00:15:37,044 --> 00:15:40,047
to dinner tomorrow night."

00:15:40,047 --> 00:15:42,149
JORDAN:
I promise to take this

00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:45,285
gorgeous piece of ass to
any damn place she wants.

00:15:45,285 --> 00:15:48,155
Ooh.
(laughs)

00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:50,023
As long as it's
under two bills.
Hey!

00:15:52,059 --> 00:15:54,628
Chick's smokin',
but that's not me.

00:15:54,628 --> 00:15:56,063
You met her
in the bar last night.

00:15:56,063 --> 00:15:57,264
We found your DNA
in her room.

00:15:57,264 --> 00:15:59,533
<i>And</i> you robbed this guy.

00:15:59,533 --> 00:16:01,234
We found your blood
in the casino.

00:16:01,234 --> 00:16:03,703
Now, why'd you shoot him?
Because he resisted?

00:16:03,703 --> 00:16:06,139
I didn't shoot anybody.

00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:09,409
Where were you
at 10:30 a.m. this morning?

00:16:09,409 --> 00:16:10,610
I don't know. Out.

00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:12,379
Having a good time.

00:16:12,379 --> 00:16:14,381
I won a free trip to Vegas;
I'm going to enjoy it.

00:16:14,381 --> 00:16:17,384
Can anyone verify that?

00:16:17,384 --> 00:16:18,585
No.

00:16:18,585 --> 00:16:20,387
I was alone.

00:16:20,387 --> 00:16:23,557
Just like you were alone
last night... not with Shelley.

00:16:23,557 --> 00:16:25,258
I'm telling you,
I don't know her.

00:16:25,258 --> 00:16:27,127
Last night,
I was with my buddy Lee.

00:16:27,127 --> 00:16:29,229
Where'd you guys go?

00:16:29,229 --> 00:16:31,431
Ballgame. The 51's.

00:16:31,431 --> 00:16:34,267
We didn't get back to
the hotel till midnight.

00:16:34,267 --> 00:16:38,371
Look, I'm telling you,
that is not me.

00:16:44,978 --> 00:16:46,313
(sighs)

00:16:46,313 --> 00:16:47,647
Hey, Arch.

00:16:47,647 --> 00:16:49,049
How's it going?

00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:50,250
(sighs)

00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,618
I'm going blind.

00:16:51,618 --> 00:16:53,587
Yeah, well, you can
give your eyes a rest

00:16:53,587 --> 00:16:55,322
just as soon as you make
a liar out of Jordan

00:16:55,322 --> 00:16:57,224
and place him at the bar
last night with Shelley.

00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:58,458
Well, already did that.

00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:01,061
Casino bar.

00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:03,096
Just after midnight.

00:17:03,096 --> 00:17:04,297
Just where he
said he wasn't.

00:17:04,297 --> 00:17:05,665
Gotcha.

00:17:05,665 --> 00:17:08,368
Well, gotcha a problem.

00:17:10,337 --> 00:17:11,538
Same time.

00:17:11,538 --> 00:17:13,106
Same guy.

00:17:13,106 --> 00:17:14,307
Coming into the hotel

00:17:14,307 --> 00:17:15,475
with his friend.

00:17:15,475 --> 00:17:17,344
Just where he said he was.

00:17:17,344 --> 00:17:19,646
How could a guy be in two places
at the same time?

00:17:19,646 --> 00:17:22,282
He can't.

00:17:26,753 --> 00:17:28,522
RUSSELL: <i>I know, I know that.</i>

00:17:28,522 --> 00:17:31,057
Sweetheart, that's not
what I'm saying.

00:17:31,057 --> 00:17:33,160
I'm...

00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,428
Well, tell them I'm sorry
I missed the breakfast.

00:17:35,428 --> 00:17:37,430
They'll understand that.

00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,765
My in-laws are in town.

00:17:38,765 --> 00:17:41,301
Hey, here's what we'll do,
all right?

00:17:41,301 --> 00:17:43,570
Let's take them out to dinner
on their way to the airport.

00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:45,438
They'd like that.

00:17:45,438 --> 00:17:47,274
All right, I love you, too.

00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:48,675
(sighs)

00:17:48,675 --> 00:17:50,677
I love my wife's parents,
but, oh, Lord.

00:17:50,677 --> 00:17:53,747
Houseguests and fish-- after
three days, they got to go.

00:17:53,747 --> 00:17:55,315
All right, who's up?

00:17:55,315 --> 00:17:56,583
Me.

00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:58,385
Uh, DNA from Jordan
Brentson was a match

00:17:58,385 --> 00:18:00,153
to the blood at
the crime scene,

00:18:00,153 --> 00:18:03,056
as well as the semen
in the condom in Shelley's room.

00:18:03,056 --> 00:18:04,491
He's our shooter.

00:18:04,491 --> 00:18:06,493
I hate to rain on
your conviction there, Gilligan,

00:18:06,493 --> 00:18:07,994
but the fingerprint
on the condom wrapper

00:18:07,994 --> 00:18:09,229
was not a match to Jordan.

00:18:09,229 --> 00:18:10,430
Same DNA

00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:11,998
and different fingerprints...

00:18:11,998 --> 00:18:13,233
Would you like
to hear my theory?

00:18:13,233 --> 00:18:14,434
Yes, please.

00:18:14,434 --> 00:18:15,635
Identical crime twins.

00:18:15,635 --> 00:18:17,037
(snickers)
You should check

00:18:17,037 --> 00:18:18,238
Jordan's birth records.

00:18:18,238 --> 00:18:20,006
Already did that.

00:18:20,006 --> 00:18:22,075
According to Columbus General,

00:18:22,075 --> 00:18:24,311
Jordan Brentson
was a single birth.

00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:26,313
Guy's an only child.

00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:28,048
Ouch. You got
another theory?

00:18:28,048 --> 00:18:29,249
Doppelganger.

00:18:29,249 --> 00:18:30,550
Mm-hmm. In doppel polo shirts?

00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,419
Well, that's how
doppelgangers roll.

00:18:32,419 --> 00:18:34,287
BRODY:
Doppelganger, identical
twins separated birth.

00:18:34,287 --> 00:18:36,022
Either way, I had Archie

00:18:36,022 --> 00:18:38,558
track Shelley and her date
after they left the bar.

00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:41,461
Our guy's getting cash
from the casino ATM.

00:18:41,461 --> 00:18:44,531
Yeah, so I pulled
the bank records, got a name:

00:18:44,531 --> 00:18:45,732
Xavier Marx.

00:18:45,732 --> 00:18:48,201
Tucson address.

00:18:52,038 --> 00:18:54,140
Xavier Marx checked into
the hotel on Friday.

00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,775
According to his room bill,

00:18:55,775 --> 00:18:58,278
the only thing he's been doing
since then is watching porn.

00:18:58,278 --> 00:19:00,080
Guess murder makes him horny.

00:19:02,282 --> 00:19:03,483
(knocking)

00:19:03,483 --> 00:19:04,684
Las Vegas Police!

00:19:04,684 --> 00:19:06,152
Open up!

00:19:06,152 --> 00:19:08,088
WOMAN:
Can you come back in an hour?

00:19:08,088 --> 00:19:09,356
Let me see that key.

00:19:12,993 --> 00:19:14,694
(giggling)

00:19:14,694 --> 00:19:16,596
Whoa. What the hell?

00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:19,699
You married or something?

00:19:19,699 --> 00:19:21,134
Talk about seeing double.

00:19:21,134 --> 00:19:23,169
You Xavier Marx?
Yeah, that's right.

00:19:23,169 --> 00:19:25,071
Put some clothes on, man;
you're coming with us.

00:19:25,071 --> 00:19:27,007
You sure know
how to wreck a party.

00:19:28,074 --> 00:19:29,242
Or you can
join in, handsome.

00:19:29,242 --> 00:19:30,443
Uh...

00:19:30,443 --> 00:19:31,645
You into twins, Mr. Marx?

00:19:31,645 --> 00:19:34,147
XAVIER:
Oh, come on, who isn't?

00:19:34,147 --> 00:19:35,448
Right, Officer?

00:19:35,448 --> 00:19:38,451
Just get dressed, dude.

00:19:38,451 --> 00:19:40,120
I don't know a Jordan Brentson.

00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,321
I don't have a brother.

00:19:41,321 --> 00:19:43,223
I'm an only child.

00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:45,558
You're telling me that you
weren't born September 18, 1987?

00:19:45,558 --> 00:19:46,760
A Virgo?

00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,261
No. I'm a Gemini.

00:19:48,261 --> 00:19:49,629
Of course you are.

00:19:49,629 --> 00:19:51,164
May 22, 1989.

00:19:51,164 --> 00:19:52,365
Hammond, Louisiana.

00:19:52,365 --> 00:19:54,067
St. Joe's Hospital.

00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:55,268
Look it up.

00:19:55,268 --> 00:19:56,636
What are you doing in Vegas?

00:19:56,636 --> 00:19:58,672
I won a free trip
on the Internet.

00:19:58,672 --> 00:20:00,407
All expenses paid.

00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:02,375
You know him?

00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:04,144
No.

00:20:04,144 --> 00:20:05,478
Who is he?

00:20:05,478 --> 00:20:06,980
He's the guy
you shot this morning.

00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,348
Excuse me?

00:20:08,348 --> 00:20:10,150
I think you saw
what I was doing this morning.

00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:11,351
All morning?

00:20:11,351 --> 00:20:13,086
Twins are very
demanding.

00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:15,355
I think I remember at one
point, I had to step out.

00:20:15,355 --> 00:20:17,257
For a smoke.

00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:19,192
So when was that?

00:20:19,192 --> 00:20:20,760
All I know is, it was
after the strawberries

00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,563
and the caramel sauce
were delivered.

00:20:23,563 --> 00:20:27,567
You should check
with room service.

00:20:27,567 --> 00:20:30,003
I don't care what these guys
say, they're identical twins.

00:20:30,003 --> 00:20:31,204
STOKES:
How do you explain

00:20:31,204 --> 00:20:32,505
the birth records
not matching up?

00:20:32,505 --> 00:20:33,773
Well, they're
probably fake.

00:20:33,773 --> 00:20:35,241
Look, they both have
criminal records...

00:20:35,241 --> 00:20:36,409
FINLAY:
Dressed the same.

00:20:36,409 --> 00:20:38,011
Both in Vegas the same time.

00:20:38,011 --> 00:20:40,280
Both claiming to have
won free trips online.

00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,748
I'm with Sara.
It's a scam.

00:20:41,748 --> 00:20:43,383
What about their alibis?

00:20:43,383 --> 00:20:45,118
So far, we can't verify
either one of them.

00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:46,586
They have to know each other.

00:20:46,586 --> 00:20:47,987
They have to have planned this.

00:20:47,987 --> 00:20:49,189
It's the perfect crime.

00:20:49,189 --> 00:20:51,057
Twins defense.

00:20:51,057 --> 00:20:54,394
Identical DNA, no way to prove
which one pulled the trigger.

00:20:54,394 --> 00:20:56,663
There is one way.

00:20:56,663 --> 00:21:00,033
Antibody profiling.

00:21:00,033 --> 00:21:02,001
ANDREWS: I didn't even know
we had all this stuff.

00:21:02,001 --> 00:21:03,536
Guess it doesn't get
much use anymore.

00:21:03,536 --> 00:21:05,672
So you haven't used antibody
profiling in a while, huh?

00:21:05,672 --> 00:21:08,708
I mean, I know it's a procedure
that's not used that much,

00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:10,310
but I've read some
journal abstracts.

00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,178
It's kind of like DNA, right?

00:21:12,178 --> 00:21:14,147
It's different, but in a lot
of ways, it's better.

00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:16,383
Right, because every person
develops their own unique

00:21:16,383 --> 00:21:18,685
antibody profile in response
to their environment.

00:21:18,685 --> 00:21:21,488
Yeah, so even identical twins
can have the same DNA,

00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:23,390
but different antibody profiles.

00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:25,558
Okay, so when we are done,

00:21:25,558 --> 00:21:27,327
we are gonna know
which one of these twins

00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:29,295
left their blood
on the casino floor.

00:21:29,295 --> 00:21:31,431
Which one is
our killer.
Mm.

Well, actually, we
found a little more

than we bargained for.

00:22:41,201 --> 00:22:42,502

Antibody profiling

Jordan

Well, someone with their DNA
put a bullet into Dr. Kiel.

00:22:58,451 --> 00:22:59,652
Yeah, agreed.

00:22:59,652 --> 00:23:01,354
So, what are you saying?

00:23:01,354 --> 00:23:03,156
We've got a third one now?

00:23:03,156 --> 00:23:05,692
Look on the bright side.

00:23:05,692 --> 00:23:07,527
At least we still know
who we're looking for.

00:23:13,533 --> 00:23:16,503
FINLAY:
Okay, so, we're talking
identical crime

00:23:16,503 --> 00:23:17,704
triplets?

00:23:17,704 --> 00:23:20,039
Oh, not quite.
If we go by

00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:21,641
the birth records,
our twins,

00:23:21,641 --> 00:23:23,276
maybe even our mystery triplet,

00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:25,979
were born at different times
and in different places.

00:23:25,979 --> 00:23:28,448
RUSSELL: So we're talking about
in-vitro fertilization, right?

00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:30,216
I mean, frozen embryos.

00:23:30,216 --> 00:23:33,119
That's the only way
you can get identical triplets

00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:34,687
from one set of parents

00:23:34,687 --> 00:23:36,556
born to three
different families.

00:23:36,556 --> 00:23:38,558
In different years
and in different cities.

00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:42,028
So, we're saying, one fertilized
embryo split three ways.

00:23:42,028 --> 00:23:43,763
Is that even
possible?

00:23:43,763 --> 00:23:45,265
Some might call it a miracle.

00:23:45,265 --> 00:23:46,599
You know what
this reminds me of?

00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:48,067
What?
That movie.

00:23:48,067 --> 00:23:50,003
Um, Gregory Peck.

00:23:50,003 --> 00:23:52,572
Uh, "We're gonna build
our own New World."

00:23:52,572 --> 00:23:55,308
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Um... <i>Boys From Brazil.</i>

00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:56,643
Yup.
Right here in Vegas.

00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:59,979
That movie is about
cloning. Hitler.

00:23:59,979 --> 00:24:02,048
Right?
Yeah, yeah,
but it's also about

00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:04,117
a doctor who played God.

00:24:04,117 --> 00:24:06,319
Yeah, but our victim, Dr. Kiel,
was a pediatrician,

00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,554
not an IVF guy.

00:24:07,554 --> 00:24:09,188
All right, but do we know

00:24:09,188 --> 00:24:10,990
if he was <i>always</i> a pediatrician,
you know?

00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:13,092
Where did he do his internship?
What was his first job?

00:24:13,092 --> 00:24:14,360
I want to know more
about this guy.

00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,296
I'm on it.

00:24:16,296 --> 00:24:19,032
That movie is also about
planning. In this case,

00:24:19,032 --> 00:24:21,267
these guys weren't planning
the Fourth Reich, but they...

00:24:21,267 --> 00:24:23,336
They were planning
a murder.
Yes.

00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:24,704
And how to get away with it.

00:24:24,704 --> 00:24:26,406
And they still think

00:24:26,406 --> 00:24:28,241
they've pulled off
the perfect crime, right?

00:24:28,241 --> 00:24:29,409
They can hide behind their DNA.

00:24:29,409 --> 00:24:30,643
Which makes them overconfident.

00:24:30,643 --> 00:24:32,045
That third guy
is probably

00:24:32,045 --> 00:24:33,246
trying to
wait us out.

00:24:33,246 --> 00:24:34,447
And I bet I know where.

00:24:34,447 --> 00:24:35,648
Diamond Dust Casino.

00:24:35,648 --> 00:24:37,183
Yeah. All right.
(phone chirps)

00:24:37,183 --> 00:24:39,185
You better fire up
his facial recognition, right?

00:24:39,185 --> 00:24:42,422
Like Henry said, at least
we know who we're looking for.

00:24:42,422 --> 00:24:43,623
What?

00:24:43,623 --> 00:24:45,224
(laughs)

00:24:45,224 --> 00:24:48,528
Jordan Brentson's lawyer
just walked into PD.

00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:51,097
She's also his mother.

00:24:51,097 --> 00:24:52,365
WOMAN: <i>My son Jordan</i>

00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:53,700

It's not the first time.

00:24:56,069 --> 00:24:57,370
He's had his...

00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,772
troubles with the law.

00:24:59,772 --> 00:25:01,474
But he's never been accused
of murder.

00:25:01,474 --> 00:25:02,675
Conspiracy, actually.

00:25:02,675 --> 00:25:05,178
He had a partner. Well,

00:25:05,178 --> 00:25:07,080
<i>partners.</i>

00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,381
Look at this.

00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:11,117
Seeing double?

00:25:11,117 --> 00:25:12,352
'Cause we are.

00:25:12,352 --> 00:25:13,620
I don't understand.

00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:16,522
Maybe this will help. Um,

00:25:16,522 --> 00:25:19,258
do you recognize this man?

00:25:19,258 --> 00:25:21,661
I've never seen him before.

00:25:21,661 --> 00:25:24,230
I get it. It's...
It's been, what, 25 years?

00:25:25,531 --> 00:25:27,767
It must be...

00:25:27,767 --> 00:25:31,537
very hard wanting
a child so much.

00:25:31,537 --> 00:25:33,606
The struggle to conceive.

00:25:33,606 --> 00:25:36,242
And then a miracle happens.

00:25:41,614 --> 00:25:43,650
It <i>was</i> a miracle.

00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:45,251
And then some.

00:25:45,251 --> 00:25:46,653
A single embryo split
three ways.

00:25:46,653 --> 00:25:50,456
The doctors told me
there were multiples.

00:25:54,293 --> 00:25:58,164
But I told them that I...

00:25:58,164 --> 00:26:00,466
I could only care
for <i>one</i> child.

00:26:02,035 --> 00:26:04,137
It was the hardest decision
of my life.

00:26:04,137 --> 00:26:05,538
BRASS:
So, you instructed

00:26:05,538 --> 00:26:08,174
the clinic to dispose
of the other embryos?

00:26:08,174 --> 00:26:11,110
That's right.

00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:15,415
A mother <i>knows</i> her son.

00:26:15,415 --> 00:26:17,617
It's way beyond biology.

00:26:19,419 --> 00:26:24,023
I would know Jordan anywhere.

00:26:24,023 --> 00:26:25,425
But this boy--

00:26:25,425 --> 00:26:27,427
I don't him.

00:26:28,428 --> 00:26:31,130

Russell's hunch
was right.

Before he was a pediatrician,

00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:47,613
BRASS:
I think she's more than lying.

00:26:47,613 --> 00:26:49,515
I think we're looking
at a modern Ma Barker here.

00:26:49,515 --> 00:26:51,417
You know, Ma Barker
had four sons.

00:26:51,417 --> 00:26:53,519
Herman, Lloyd,
Arthur and Fred.

00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:56,322
Masterminded her own Little
Crime House on the Prairie.

00:26:56,322 --> 00:26:59,425
Wow. You're like a
World Book of Crime.

00:26:59,425 --> 00:27:03,362
Well, I'm, like,
not impressed with her story.

00:27:03,362 --> 00:27:05,231
I don't know. I mean,
she's a defense attorney.

00:27:05,231 --> 00:27:06,432
She's not a criminal.

00:27:06,432 --> 00:27:07,633
I don't see the distinction.

00:27:07,633 --> 00:27:09,268
And I see plenty of motive.

00:27:09,268 --> 00:27:11,604
She had a kid in a dish,
wanted the extras tossed.

00:27:11,604 --> 00:27:13,639
Somehow found out
they weren't.

00:27:13,639 --> 00:27:15,241
Blamed the doctor
for playing God,

00:27:15,241 --> 00:27:16,676
and giving away what was hers.

00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:19,479
Then Ma Barker rounds up
her boys for payback.

00:27:19,479 --> 00:27:20,680
BRASS:
Well, like you said,

00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,415
she's a defense attorney.

00:27:22,415 --> 00:27:23,616
Pretty good plan.

00:27:23,616 --> 00:27:26,252
Unless we catch the shooter.

00:27:40,233 --> 00:27:42,135
Fire in the hole!

00:28:13,266 --> 00:28:14,734
Lose something?

00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:19,005
No. I think I found the answer
to our ballistics mystery.

00:28:19,005 --> 00:28:20,206
Oh, yeah?

00:28:20,206 --> 00:28:22,742
Our little red hourglass.

00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:24,577
Found only in No-Rico Shells.

00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:26,746
As in, "no ricochet."

00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:29,282
It's the exact type of bullet
our killer used.

00:28:29,282 --> 00:28:31,284
They were originally developed
for air marshals.

00:28:31,284 --> 00:28:33,052
So that it doesn't go
through-and-through

00:28:33,052 --> 00:28:34,253
and puncture the fuselage.

00:28:34,253 --> 00:28:35,988
(gunshot)

00:28:35,988 --> 00:28:37,557
FINLAY: <i>No-Rico shell</i>
<i>breaks up on impact.</i>

00:28:37,557 --> 00:28:40,193
<i>The hourglass tip</i>
<i>is like a cork</i>

00:28:40,193 --> 00:28:44,564
<i>that pops and releases a lethal</i>
<i>shotgun blast of pellets.</i>

00:28:44,564 --> 00:28:49,168
Okay, well, that would explain
Dr. Kiel's macerated liver.
Yeah.

00:28:49,168 --> 00:28:52,038
What do you think? We're
looking for an air marshal?

00:28:52,038 --> 00:28:54,607
Or at least
an air marshal's gun.

00:28:56,409 --> 00:28:58,411
(computer beeps and trills)

00:29:01,247 --> 00:29:04,550
Hey, Arch, you still on
the hunt for the third man?
(sighs)

00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:06,352
Yeah, going into hour 14.

00:29:06,352 --> 00:29:08,020
Can't take a break
till I find him.

00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:10,456
Hey, I think I
got something.

00:29:10,456 --> 00:29:13,159
Those free trips to
Vegas our suspects won...

00:29:13,159 --> 00:29:15,695
At first, I thought it was
just a line they were using.

00:29:15,695 --> 00:29:17,463
Then I thought, if
they've been so careful

00:29:17,463 --> 00:29:19,232
to create so many
cover stories,

00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:21,300
maybe they created a free
trip to cover their tracks.

00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,501
Which they did?

00:29:22,501 --> 00:29:24,203
Checked with
the hotel.

00:29:24,203 --> 00:29:26,572
Three trips were booked
online via Sunview Travel.

00:29:26,572 --> 00:29:30,443
Sent via e-mail to Jordan
Brentson, Xavier Marx

00:29:30,443 --> 00:29:32,445
and again, a familiar face.
Kevin Chance.

00:29:32,445 --> 00:29:33,980
Minneapolis address.

00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,448
Check out the birth
date on the license.

00:29:35,448 --> 00:29:37,183
July 30, 1989.

00:29:37,183 --> 00:29:39,118
Makes him the youngest,
and a criminal record.

00:29:39,118 --> 00:29:40,586
Interesting
employment history, too.

00:29:40,586 --> 00:29:42,588
Before being dropped
for drunk and disorderly,

00:29:42,588 --> 00:29:44,590
he was training
to be an air marshal.

00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:46,192
I think we got our shooter.

00:29:46,192 --> 00:29:48,160
And according
to the Diamond Dust Casino,

00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,563
he's still checked in--
room 2211.

00:29:50,563 --> 00:29:52,732
LVPD! Show me
your hands!

00:29:52,732 --> 00:29:54,400
Hands!

00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,235
Heard the man, Mr. Chance.
Hands on your head.

00:30:11,217 --> 00:30:13,019
Yeah, he's
ice cold.

00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:16,022
He's been dead for a while.

00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:18,024
Looks like an overdose.

00:30:22,228 --> 00:30:23,629
Credit cards.

00:30:23,629 --> 00:30:25,698
Belong to Dr. Kiel.

00:30:29,335 --> 00:30:32,371
Smith &amp; Wesson .38,
just like the murder weapon.

00:30:32,371 --> 00:30:34,040
No-Rico Shells.

00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,142
Same as the shells we pulled out
of that the slot machine

00:30:36,142 --> 00:30:37,476
<i>and</i> Dr. Kiel.

00:30:37,476 --> 00:30:39,478
(sighs)

00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:49,455
I killed Dr. Kiel.

00:30:49,455 --> 00:30:51,257
He's to blame.

00:30:51,257 --> 00:30:54,193
If it wasn't
for him playing God,

00:30:54,193 --> 00:30:56,295
I wouldn't have existed.

00:30:56,295 --> 00:30:58,764
Had the miserable life
that I've had.

00:30:58,764 --> 00:31:02,368
This whole thing was my idea.

00:31:02,368 --> 00:31:07,406
I thought that killing
Dr. Kiel was the answer.

00:31:07,406 --> 00:31:09,408
But this...

00:31:10,576 --> 00:31:13,079
This...

00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:15,114
This is the answer.

00:31:23,622 --> 00:31:25,658
(sighs)

00:31:29,028 --> 00:31:30,496
(sighs)

00:31:30,496 --> 00:31:32,231
Do you think this is <i>our</i> answer?

00:31:32,231 --> 00:31:36,535
We've been chasing the wrong guy
this whole time.

00:31:36,535 --> 00:31:39,305
Why should we have
the right one now?

00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:47,446
Preliminary tox indicates
Kevin Chance died

00:31:47,446 --> 00:31:49,982
from a massive overdose
of alprazolam and alcohol.

00:31:49,982 --> 00:31:51,650
Well, that fits
with the suicide video.

00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:53,753
Right?
I'm not sure
that video

00:31:53,753 --> 00:31:55,621
captured the whole story.

00:31:55,621 --> 00:31:57,289
What do you mean?
I found signs

00:31:57,289 --> 00:31:58,758
of blunt-force trauma.

00:31:58,758 --> 00:32:01,293
Looks like a blow to the head.

00:32:01,293 --> 00:32:05,064
And I also dissected
the victim's neck.

00:32:05,064 --> 00:32:06,599
See the abrasions
on his trachea?

00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:08,401
Look like circular patterns.

00:32:08,401 --> 00:32:10,169
The diameter's consistent

00:32:10,169 --> 00:32:12,304
with the mouth of a bottle--
say a bottle

00:32:12,304 --> 00:32:14,573
of Scotch shoved
down his throat.

00:32:14,573 --> 00:32:16,275
As for pills,

00:32:16,275 --> 00:32:19,011
I found no solid
remnants in his stomach.

00:32:19,011 --> 00:32:23,315
Ah. Well, how-how did the drugs
get into his system, then?

00:32:23,315 --> 00:32:25,051
Henry tested

00:32:25,051 --> 00:32:27,186
the Scotch bottle
and found toxic levels of

00:32:27,186 --> 00:32:28,587
alprazolam.

00:32:28,587 --> 00:32:31,090
So, somebody ground up
the pills, dissolved them,

00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:33,325
spiked the drink...

00:32:33,325 --> 00:32:34,727
And faked the video.

00:32:34,727 --> 00:32:36,762
What do you estimate
time of death?

00:32:36,762 --> 00:32:39,165
Approximately
12 hours ago.

00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:41,634
About an hour after
the shooting of Dr. Kiel,

00:32:41,634 --> 00:32:44,136
while we were still
chasing our tails.

00:32:44,136 --> 00:32:47,339
Yeah, I smell the twins
at work here.

00:33:00,586 --> 00:33:02,721
Did you get it?

00:33:02,721 --> 00:33:04,290
Yeah, well, Kevin

00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:06,125
didn't shove that bottle
down his own throat,

00:33:06,125 --> 00:33:08,694
and he didn't make
the bogus suicide video.

00:33:08,694 --> 00:33:11,730
Right, but whoever did,
maybe they left behind
some touch DNA.

00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:14,100
And their antibodies.
Yeah.

00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,368
I'll get Henry on it.

00:33:17,636 --> 00:33:19,238
STOKES: Hey, Morgan,
I got your text.

00:33:19,238 --> 00:33:21,640
What's up?
You and Sara were right.

00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,342
Doc Robbins said
the suicide was fake.

00:33:23,342 --> 00:33:25,144
So much for brotherly love.

00:33:25,144 --> 00:33:26,645
Well, I do have some love.

00:33:26,645 --> 00:33:29,048
I figured out who bought
those "free trips" to Vegas.

00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:30,249
Yeah, who's that?

00:33:30,249 --> 00:33:32,251
Dr. Kiel.
Booked his own vacation

00:33:32,251 --> 00:33:34,120
with his son
at the same time.

00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,688
Take a look at this.

00:33:35,688 --> 00:33:38,257
I got these files
off of his computer.

00:33:38,257 --> 00:33:39,558
For the past few months,

00:33:39,558 --> 00:33:41,594
Kiel's been keeping
track of the triplets.

00:33:41,594 --> 00:33:43,395
Got the contact information
for the parents

00:33:43,395 --> 00:33:45,064
who received the embryos.

00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:46,732
And he took it from there
and tracked them down.

00:33:46,732 --> 00:33:48,200
But for what?

00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,336
Some kind of weird
embryo doctor reunion?

00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:51,670
I mean, why do it?

00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:53,305
Jordan's mother said
that the clinic

00:33:53,305 --> 00:33:55,141
was supposed to
destroy the embryos.

00:33:55,141 --> 00:33:57,109
But, obviously, Kiel
didn't follow through.

00:33:57,109 --> 00:33:58,377
Based on these

00:33:58,377 --> 00:34:00,346
criminal records,
these triplets' lives

00:34:00,346 --> 00:34:01,981
didn't go so well.

00:34:01,981 --> 00:34:03,749
And you think that Kiel
felt guilty and was trying

00:34:03,749 --> 00:34:05,151
to make it right somehow?

00:34:05,151 --> 00:34:06,352
Take a look at this.

00:34:06,352 --> 00:34:07,720
Two days before
he was murdered,

00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,722
Kiel withdrew 150 grand.

00:34:09,722 --> 00:34:12,291
Compensation for pain
and suffering.
But maybe not enough.

00:34:12,291 --> 00:34:14,560
He was a very successful
pediatrician.

00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,761
A rich man.

00:34:15,761 --> 00:34:17,163
With one unethical chapter

00:34:17,163 --> 00:34:18,697
in his past.

00:34:18,697 --> 00:34:21,167
He makes a great target
for blackmail.

00:34:21,167 --> 00:34:22,601
Blackmail gone bad.

00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:28,440
I heard Russell put
you back to work.

00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,675
Yeah.

00:34:29,675 --> 00:34:31,644
What'd you find?

00:34:31,644 --> 00:34:34,613
This is good.

00:34:34,613 --> 00:34:36,515
Profiling confirms it was
Kevin Chance's blood

00:34:36,515 --> 00:34:38,551
on the casino floor.
We have our shooter.

00:34:38,551 --> 00:34:39,752
Look at page two.

00:34:39,752 --> 00:34:42,087
Antibody results
on the scotch bottle

00:34:42,087 --> 00:34:43,289
from the touch DNA.

00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:45,524
You've got to be kidding me.

00:34:45,524 --> 00:34:46,992
There's a fourth man?

00:34:46,992 --> 00:34:48,494
Yep. Antibodies
on the bottle

00:34:48,494 --> 00:34:50,429
excluded Kevin,
Jordan, and Xavier.

00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:52,598
You're telling me that we're
looking for quadruplets?

00:34:52,598 --> 00:34:54,266
Yeah. Number four
is alive and well,

00:34:54,266 --> 00:34:55,634
and dressed to kill.

00:34:55,634 --> 00:34:57,570
I'm guessing in an
orange polo and blue jeans.

00:34:57,570 --> 00:34:59,205
Do you think he's
still at the hotel?

00:34:59,205 --> 00:35:00,673
Well, Archie's got
facial recognition

00:35:00,673 --> 00:35:02,608
watching all the exits,
so he has to be.

00:35:02,608 --> 00:35:04,276
Where are you going?

00:35:04,276 --> 00:35:07,112
If Kiel arranged the reunion,
it stands to reason

00:35:07,112 --> 00:35:09,114
that he met with those guys
before they killed him.

00:35:09,114 --> 00:35:10,316
Okay, so?

00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:12,351
So maybe we have a witness.

00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:19,525
Can I give you a hand?

00:35:19,525 --> 00:35:22,228
Got it. Thanks.

00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:25,631
The policeman said
you found the man.

00:35:25,631 --> 00:35:27,032
We did.

00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:30,469
You know, you told me
that, um...

00:35:30,469 --> 00:35:32,204
your dad brought you here

00:35:32,204 --> 00:35:34,440
to see Kanye.

00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,642
Did he have any other reason
to be in Vegas?
He did say

00:35:36,642 --> 00:35:38,344
there were some people
he was gonna meet.

00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:40,012
Did you meet them?

00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:42,314
When they were coming over,
he gave me money...

00:35:42,314 --> 00:35:45,150
told me to go to the arcade.

00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:46,352
So that's a "no"?

00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:49,622
I did come back
a little early.

00:35:49,622 --> 00:35:51,357
Saw him talking
to these two guys.

00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:53,626
<i>It was really weird.</i>

00:35:53,626 --> 00:35:56,161
<i>They looked exactly alike,</i>
<i>even dressed alike.</i>

00:35:58,731 --> 00:36:00,132
Did they look like this?

00:36:01,567 --> 00:36:03,068
Yeah.

00:36:03,068 --> 00:36:04,603
I asked my dad
about them.

00:36:04,603 --> 00:36:06,105
He told me they
had two brothers--

00:36:06,105 --> 00:36:07,306
they all looked alike.

00:36:07,306 --> 00:36:09,308
My dad...

00:36:09,308 --> 00:36:11,176
helped deliver them as babies.

00:36:12,344 --> 00:36:15,247
Was it one of them?

00:36:15,247 --> 00:36:16,749
Yeah...

00:36:16,749 --> 00:36:19,518
it was.

00:36:19,518 --> 00:36:21,086
Listen, um...

00:36:22,721 --> 00:36:25,057
we were able to contact
your family in Wisconsin.

00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:27,192
And you're gonna be staying
with them for a while.

00:36:27,192 --> 00:36:29,995
I don't want to go to Wisconsin.

00:36:31,463 --> 00:36:34,133
I'm sorry.

00:36:36,268 --> 00:36:39,138
You know, um...

00:36:39,138 --> 00:36:42,007
I could really...

00:36:42,007 --> 00:36:44,243
go for an ice cream
right now. There's, um,

00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:46,111
a great place downstairs.

00:36:46,111 --> 00:36:48,247
Would you like some ice cream?

00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:50,182
Sure.

00:36:52,184 --> 00:36:54,386
(sighs)

00:36:54,386 --> 00:36:58,190
Earning your money
on this one, huh, Arch?
Oh, man,

00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:00,559
I am so sick
of looking for this face.

00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:02,261
Well, look at
the bright side.

00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:04,596
Oh, we still know who
we're looking for.

00:37:04,596 --> 00:37:06,198
Ha, ha, ha.

00:37:06,198 --> 00:37:08,233
Yeah, man, I am tired
of that joke and I am

00:37:08,233 --> 00:37:10,436
getting really
tired here.

00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:12,171
Whoa.

00:37:12,171 --> 00:37:14,206
Got a hit.

00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:19,678
How is it?
Good. Thanks.

00:37:19,678 --> 00:37:21,313
Yours?
Good.

00:37:21,313 --> 00:37:23,015
(phone rings)
Oh.

00:37:23,015 --> 00:37:25,484
Excuse me for a second

00:37:25,484 --> 00:37:28,354
Hey, Nick.
What's up?

00:37:28,354 --> 00:37:29,555
We got a hit on our suspect.

00:37:29,555 --> 00:37:31,156
Where is he?

00:37:31,156 --> 00:37:33,325
Sitting right behind you,
eating ice cream.

00:37:36,395 --> 00:37:37,996
Are you sure?

00:37:37,996 --> 00:37:40,332
Relative position of
features, proportionality,

00:37:40,332 --> 00:37:42,301
by age ten,
facial metrics are set.

00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:44,002
Yeah, I'm sure.
We're sure.

00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:53,112
You all done?

00:37:53,112 --> 00:37:55,280
Yeah.

00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,182
I'll take that.

00:37:59,451 --> 00:38:02,321
Can we go now?

00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:04,056
Yeah.

00:38:09,561 --> 00:38:11,463
BRASS: So we ran
your DNA, Avery.

00:38:11,463 --> 00:38:14,032
Big surprise--
it matched your brothers.

00:38:14,032 --> 00:38:15,401
I guess you
could call them brothers,

00:38:15,401 --> 00:38:16,602
certainly brothers
in crime.

00:38:16,602 --> 00:38:18,003
We thought it
was your dad

00:38:18,003 --> 00:38:19,338
that arranged
those "free trips."

00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:22,107
Turns out it was you.
Contacted the ISP,

00:38:22,107 --> 00:38:24,176
while you were booking
flights and hotels,

00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:26,445
you were also doing
a little shopping online--

00:38:26,445 --> 00:38:28,280
skateboard, video games...

00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,515
oh yeah, and a nice

00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:31,250
new pair of kicks.

00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:33,419
BRASS: So I guess you like
spending your old man's money.

00:38:33,419 --> 00:38:35,154
Uh, just like when
we found you at the hotel

00:38:35,154 --> 00:38:36,655
running up the
room service bill

00:38:36,655 --> 00:38:38,690
on cake and ice cream.
This weekend's my birthday.

00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:41,627
I told you my dad
liked to buy me stuff.
Well, forget

00:38:41,627 --> 00:38:43,762
cake and ice cream.
Forget sneakers.

00:38:43,762 --> 00:38:45,564
Your dad's a rich man.

00:38:45,564 --> 00:38:47,466
You're the sole beneficiary
in his will.

00:38:47,466 --> 00:38:49,101
You have 25k a year
until you're 18,

00:38:49,101 --> 00:38:50,736
then you get the whole nut:
six million bucks.

00:38:50,736 --> 00:38:52,771
I don't know
anything about that.

00:38:52,771 --> 00:38:54,239
What about the
$150,000

00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:56,241
transferred from
your dad's savings

00:38:56,241 --> 00:38:58,310
into a money market,
with two payments

00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:02,214
scheduled for exactly
24 hours after he was murdered?

00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:04,716
75K goes to your bro,
Jordan Brentson

00:39:04,716 --> 00:39:07,653
and 75K to your other bro,
Xavier Marx.

00:39:07,653 --> 00:39:09,388
Poor Kevin got stiffed.
And let me guess.

00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:11,256
He wanted a bigger cut
for being

00:39:11,256 --> 00:39:13,725
the trigger man, and that didn't
sit well with the family.

00:39:13,725 --> 00:39:15,627
I'm the one who took the risk.

00:39:15,627 --> 00:39:17,262
I was the one who
pulled the trigger.

00:39:17,262 --> 00:39:18,697
It was my ass
hanging out there.

00:39:18,697 --> 00:39:20,632
Still is.

00:39:20,632 --> 00:39:24,503
How do you guys feel about
splitting 150K two ways?

00:39:29,541 --> 00:39:31,376
Whose idea was it to make it
look like a suicide?

00:39:31,376 --> 00:39:32,578
Yours?

00:39:33,745 --> 00:39:35,514
We all have the same DNA.

00:39:35,514 --> 00:39:38,050
There's no way of knowing
who was in that room.

00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:39,251
That's the
thing, Avery.

00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:40,652
We do know.

00:39:40,652 --> 00:39:42,187
You planned
this very well.

00:39:42,187 --> 00:39:43,622
You knew you could hide
behind the DNA,

00:39:43,622 --> 00:39:45,023
but you missed something.

00:39:45,023 --> 00:39:46,225
It's called

00:39:46,225 --> 00:39:47,493
antibody profiling.

00:39:47,493 --> 00:39:49,127
And that puts
that bottle of scotch

00:39:49,127 --> 00:39:50,696
that was jammed down
Kevin Chance's throat

00:39:50,696 --> 00:39:52,564
in your hands.

00:40:02,174 --> 00:40:03,542
(sighs)

00:40:03,542 --> 00:40:07,713
There was some bad seed
in that petri dish.

00:40:07,713 --> 00:40:09,681
This couldn't have been
just all about the money.

00:40:09,681 --> 00:40:12,284
You wouldn't understand.

00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:14,152
Try me.

00:40:16,555 --> 00:40:18,423
When my mom died...

00:40:18,423 --> 00:40:20,425
at the funeral,
I heard my cousins

00:40:20,425 --> 00:40:23,295
talking about how sad it was
that she couldn't get pregnant.

00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:25,197
How she had to go and thaw out

00:40:25,197 --> 00:40:27,032
somebody else's kid
to put in her.

00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:30,269
I confronted my dad.

00:40:30,269 --> 00:40:32,371
He told me
about the four brothers,

00:40:32,371 --> 00:40:34,573
all from one embryo.

00:40:34,573 --> 00:40:36,542
Identical, perfect.

00:40:36,542 --> 00:40:39,044
He had taken
the last one.

00:40:39,044 --> 00:40:40,746
Given it life.

00:40:40,746 --> 00:40:42,180
Me.

00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:44,583
I was his final miracle.

00:40:44,583 --> 00:40:46,518
What miracle?

00:40:46,518 --> 00:40:48,587
It was all a lie.

00:40:48,587 --> 00:40:51,123
Still doesn't explain
what you did.

00:40:51,123 --> 00:40:53,725
My dad...

00:40:53,725 --> 00:40:56,528
was always so cold.

00:40:56,528 --> 00:40:58,196
Now I know why.

00:40:58,196 --> 00:41:00,666
My mom's the only one
who really loved me.

00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:03,769
And she wasn't even my mom.

00:41:03,769 --> 00:41:07,372
And that day she was
taken away from me again...

00:41:07,372 --> 00:41:10,709
I blame him.

00:41:12,477 --> 00:41:15,213
I'm 12 years old...

00:41:15,213 --> 00:41:17,616
what jury's gonna put me away?

00:41:17,616 --> 00:41:19,551
Don't be so sure.

00:41:19,551 --> 00:41:22,020
Last year an 11-year-old boy

00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:24,590
was put away for murder,
life without parole.

00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:26,224
You can help

00:41:26,224 --> 00:41:27,993
yourself here, Avery.

00:41:27,993 --> 00:41:29,695
You created
the prefect crime.

00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:31,363
SIDLE: Perfect.

00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:33,732
Except that it was perfect
for Jordan and Xavier.

00:41:33,732 --> 00:41:36,501
The only physical
evidence we have

00:41:36,501 --> 00:41:38,370
points to Kevin
killing your dad...

00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:40,105
And you killing Kevin.

00:41:40,105 --> 00:41:42,174
Come on, kid.
Save yourself.

00:41:42,174 --> 00:41:44,209
Give up the twins.

00:41:45,344 --> 00:41:47,546
No.

00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:50,182
I'll take my chances.

00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:53,118
Like you said...

00:41:53,118 --> 00:41:55,153
they're my brothers.

00:41:56,321 --> 00:41:59,524
They're my only real family.
