00:00:02,942 --> 00:00:04,844
RUSSELL: <i>You want to know</i>
<i>why I brought you here?</i>

00:00:04,844 --> 00:00:06,078
FINLAY:
<i>Yeah, I do.</i>

00:00:06,078 --> 00:00:07,914
Well, this is it.
Team needs you.

00:00:07,914 --> 00:00:10,550
Go out there and kick
some butt, please.
I will.

00:00:11,818 --> 00:00:13,820
(indistinct shouting, applause)

00:00:15,822 --> 00:00:17,623
RUSSELL: Pitching low
and outside.

00:00:17,623 --> 00:00:19,926
FINLAY:
Just like I like it.

00:00:19,926 --> 00:00:22,762
WOMAN: Come on, Finn!
You've got this!

00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:26,032
MAN: Knock it out of
the park, Finn!

00:00:26,032 --> 00:00:27,567
Come on, Finlay!

00:00:29,068 --> 00:00:30,470
Bring it in, boys.

00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:32,371
CSI Barbie's
not gonna hit it

00:00:32,371 --> 00:00:33,573
out of the infield.

00:00:33,573 --> 00:00:34,740
Yeah, come on in, boys.

00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:35,975
Bring it in.
Bring it in.

00:00:35,975 --> 00:00:37,643
Come on in, you guys.
Come on in.

00:00:37,643 --> 00:00:39,412
I'm just gonna hit it
right over your heads.

00:00:39,412 --> 00:00:40,680
Hey, you don't want
to get her mad.

00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,881
She's not going to stop

00:00:41,881 --> 00:00:43,082
at first base anyway.

00:00:43,082 --> 00:00:44,584
That's because she'll be out.

00:00:44,584 --> 00:00:45,952
(taunting laughter)
That's right.

00:00:45,952 --> 00:00:47,520
Just wait.
STOKES: Let's go, Finn.

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,924
Bring me home now.
You got this.

00:00:51,924 --> 00:00:53,759
Strike.
Oh, come on!

00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:56,729
That was so outside.
Oh, ump!

00:00:56,729 --> 00:00:58,598
You kidding me?
RUSSELL:
Hey, Finn, come on.

00:00:58,598 --> 00:01:00,800
Shake it off. Shake it off.
SANDERS:
You got this, Finn.

00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,001
What happened to you?

00:01:02,001 --> 00:01:03,402
Let's bring Nicky home.

00:01:03,402 --> 00:01:04,604
Come on, Finn!

00:01:04,604 --> 00:01:05,838
Home run!
Shut these guys up!

00:01:05,838 --> 00:01:07,773
MAN: Nice and easy.
Nice and easy.

00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:29,529
(shouting and whooping)

00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:32,632
And all the way!

00:01:32,632 --> 00:01:34,333
(whooping)

00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:35,801
Come on, suckers!

00:01:36,969 --> 00:01:38,404
Come on, Speedy!
She's going!

00:01:38,404 --> 00:01:39,972
She's going!

00:01:39,972 --> 00:01:41,340
Bring it!

00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,542
Ah! Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:01:42,542 --> 00:01:43,776
Oh, ow, ow, ow, ow.

00:01:43,776 --> 00:01:46,045
(groaning)

00:01:46,045 --> 00:01:47,446
You all right?

00:01:47,446 --> 00:01:48,648
Ugh.

00:01:48,648 --> 00:01:49,849
Maybe you pulled a muscle.

00:01:49,849 --> 00:01:51,951
Kind of feels like it.

00:01:51,951 --> 00:01:53,953
Might need a rubdown later.

00:01:55,354 --> 00:01:57,456
I'll keep that in mind.

00:01:57,456 --> 00:01:58,891
Maybe a cold shower.
WOMAN:
Come on!

00:01:58,891 --> 00:02:00,660
Come on, guys!
That's it!

00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,028
SANDERS:
All right, Henry.

00:02:02,028 --> 00:02:03,429
It's all up to you.

00:02:03,429 --> 00:02:05,064
(whooping, shouting)

00:02:05,064 --> 00:02:06,465
(laughing)

00:02:06,465 --> 00:02:07,900
Take that, Bice.

00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,802
Come on, Henry!

00:02:09,802 --> 00:02:11,637
(phone ringing)
Come on, Henry.
Hit me in!

00:02:11,637 --> 00:02:12,972
Come on, Henry.
You can do it!

00:02:12,972 --> 00:02:14,674
Hey, wait. Time, time,
time, time, time.

00:02:14,674 --> 00:02:15,942
FINLAY:
Henry!
Time, time, time.

00:02:15,942 --> 00:02:17,910
Time out.

00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,312
What's going on?

00:02:19,312 --> 00:02:20,813
I just got a 911 from Brass.

00:02:20,813 --> 00:02:22,448
Gotta take it.

00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:26,586
All right, sorry, guys.
I got to go to work.

00:02:26,586 --> 00:02:27,787
(all groaning)

00:02:27,787 --> 00:02:29,522
MAN:
Stokes?

00:02:29,522 --> 00:02:32,425
You know the tournament rules.
You have to have nine players.

00:02:32,425 --> 00:02:33,793
If you leave now, you forfeit.

00:02:35,695 --> 00:02:37,830
Well, I guess
we're gonna have to forfeit.

00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,565
(groaning)

00:02:40,933 --> 00:02:42,335
I'm sorry, y'all.

00:02:42,335 --> 00:02:44,704
You're welcome, Henry.

00:02:45,738 --> 00:02:48,040
(sighs)

00:02:50,876 --> 00:02:52,578
Oh, sorry to interrupt
your game, Nick.

00:02:52,578 --> 00:02:53,779
You know D.A. Melvoy.

00:02:53,779 --> 00:02:54,981
Hey.

00:02:54,981 --> 00:02:56,382
On a Sunday.
This can't be good.

00:02:56,382 --> 00:02:57,750
We have a problem.

00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,552
Detective Sam Vega.

00:02:59,552 --> 00:03:00,853
Yeah, he's dead.

00:03:00,853 --> 00:03:02,655
Yeah, that's the
problem with dirty cops.

00:03:02,655 --> 00:03:04,890
Alive or dead, they leave
a lot of dirty laundry behind.

00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:08,461
I received a remittitur on
<i>People v. Carl Bowden.</i>

00:03:08,461 --> 00:03:10,696
Bowden was convicted
of murder seven years ago.

00:03:10,696 --> 00:03:11,964
It's been overturned.

00:03:11,964 --> 00:03:13,666
Yeah, I remember
it well.

00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:15,635
Bowden beat some college kid
to death in an alley.

00:03:15,635 --> 00:03:16,836
But he confessed
to the crime.

00:03:16,836 --> 00:03:18,437
Even led us to the body.

00:03:18,437 --> 00:03:19,972
Bowden's attorney
has claimed coercion.

00:03:19,972 --> 00:03:21,841
He says that Vega
beat the confession out of him.

00:03:21,841 --> 00:03:24,076
No, that's a load of defense
attorney crap, and you know it.

00:03:24,076 --> 00:03:25,945
Well, the appellate court
disagrees with you.

00:03:25,945 --> 00:03:27,346
They threw out the confession.

00:03:27,346 --> 00:03:28,914
And it gets worse.

00:03:28,914 --> 00:03:30,316
Vega put away hundreds of guys.

00:03:30,316 --> 00:03:31,517
BRASS:
Bowden goes free,

00:03:31,517 --> 00:03:32,852
prison doors open,

00:03:32,852 --> 00:03:34,553
and a parade
of scumbags hit the street.

00:03:34,553 --> 00:03:36,589
So, what's our next move?

00:03:36,589 --> 00:03:37,990
We retry him.

00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:40,326
Okay.
No, not okay. Tell him.

00:03:40,326 --> 00:03:42,361
Anything that Bowden
gave you during

00:03:42,361 --> 00:03:44,897
and after his confession is
fruit of the poisonous tree.

00:03:44,897 --> 00:03:47,033
Including the body.
We can't use any of it.

00:03:47,033 --> 00:03:48,567
That was the whole case.

00:03:48,567 --> 00:03:50,036
MELVOY: Well, it's only
a matter of days

00:03:50,036 --> 00:03:52,038
before the judge cuts him loose.

00:03:52,038 --> 00:03:55,307
So you better find new evidence,
fast, or he walks.

00:03:57,543 --> 00:03:59,745
Hope you won the game.

00:03:59,745 --> 00:04:04,083
No, we lost that, too.

How's the leg?
Oh, it's fine.

00:04:41,654 --> 00:04:44,924
I walked it off.
Oh, good.

00:04:44,924 --> 00:04:46,659
Good, good, good.

00:04:46,659 --> 00:04:48,627
Too bad, though, huh?
We could have won that game.

00:04:48,627 --> 00:04:49,829
Oh, I know.

00:04:49,829 --> 00:04:51,564
That was such a tough break.

00:04:51,564 --> 00:04:52,865
Still, it was a pretty bad pull.

00:04:52,865 --> 00:04:54,400
Yeah.

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,068
It's funny.
I didn't really feel it

00:04:56,068 --> 00:04:58,771
until I saw that very cute guy
on third base.

00:04:58,771 --> 00:05:00,406
Yeah, you're unbelievable.

00:05:00,406 --> 00:05:02,007
You couldn't have waited
until after the game

00:05:02,007 --> 00:05:03,809
to come on
to him?
Uh-uh.

00:05:03,809 --> 00:05:05,010
We were this close to winning.

00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,412
Hey, Russell?
What?

00:05:06,412 --> 00:05:07,613
You got a minute?

00:05:07,613 --> 00:05:09,415
Come on, Jules.
What are you doing?

00:05:09,415 --> 00:05:11,617
The guy's a cop.

00:05:14,019 --> 00:05:15,421
I really liked Vega.

00:05:15,421 --> 00:05:17,490
I worked a lot of cases
with him.

00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:20,426
I never figured him for being
dirty or anything like that.

00:05:20,426 --> 00:05:22,695
Nobody starts
out that way.

00:05:22,695 --> 00:05:24,830
But once you are,
that's <i>all</i> you are.

00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,932
Yeah, unfortunately.

00:05:26,932 --> 00:05:28,634
Go on.

00:05:28,634 --> 00:05:31,837
So, the morning after
I finished the crime scene,

00:05:31,837 --> 00:05:35,007
Vega found a witness
who said she saw Bowden

00:05:35,007 --> 00:05:36,375
leaving the alley.

00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:37,576
Witness recognized him?

00:05:37,576 --> 00:05:39,078
Yeah, Bowden was her mechanic.

00:05:39,078 --> 00:05:41,714
So, Vega picks him up,
I meet him at PD.

00:05:41,714 --> 00:05:44,350
We had him in the room
for, like, five hours.

00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,551
It wasn't going anywhere.

00:05:45,551 --> 00:05:46,919
We were burning
through audio tapes.

00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:48,320
So, I left the room

00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,022
to get some more
from the night sergeant.

00:05:50,022 --> 00:05:52,591
I was gone maybe 15,
20 minutes, tops.

00:05:52,591 --> 00:05:56,595
<i>When I come back in,</i>

00:05:56,595 --> 00:05:59,398
<i>I see Bowden...</i>

00:05:59,398 --> 00:06:00,599
What the hell happened?

00:06:00,599 --> 00:06:02,001
He lunged at me
across the table.

00:06:02,001 --> 00:06:04,336
I had to set him straight.

00:06:04,336 --> 00:06:05,538
He's bleeding.

00:06:05,538 --> 00:06:07,640
He's fine.
Take a seat.

00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,608
You're going to want
to hear this.

00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,912
Shortly after that,
he confessed.

00:06:12,912 --> 00:06:16,415
Did you tell your
supervisor what you saw?
No.

00:06:16,415 --> 00:06:17,850
I never told anyone.

00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:19,084
But...

00:06:19,084 --> 00:06:20,519
look, I know the drill.

00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:21,887
It's all about trust.

00:06:21,887 --> 00:06:23,722
The more the detectives
trust you,

00:06:23,722 --> 00:06:26,091
the more they'll ask you
to work on the big cases.

00:06:26,091 --> 00:06:27,626
Bowden copped to the murder.

00:06:27,626 --> 00:06:29,728
He showed us
where he dumped the body.

00:06:29,728 --> 00:06:31,597
He definitely killed that kid.

00:06:31,597 --> 00:06:33,332
So, so what?
So, Vega said,

00:06:33,332 --> 00:06:35,634
"He jumped me,
and I had to set him straight."

00:06:35,634 --> 00:06:38,404
How am I supposed to know
he's not telling the truth?

00:06:38,404 --> 00:06:39,939
Well, you must have
suspected something,

00:06:39,939 --> 00:06:41,574
or we wouldn't be sitting here.

00:06:41,574 --> 00:06:43,042
Look, I'm not saying
what he did was okay,

00:06:43,042 --> 00:06:45,711
but it's not like
he put the guy in the hospital.

00:06:45,711 --> 00:06:47,012
He gave him a bloody lip.

00:06:47,012 --> 00:06:49,448
And because of that,
a killer's in prison,

00:06:49,448 --> 00:06:50,950
and a mother gets
to bury her son.
Yeah.

00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,651
Wait a second.

00:06:52,651 --> 00:06:54,653
See, that mother would have
buried her son anyway.

00:06:54,653 --> 00:06:58,591
Eventually, the evidence
would have led you to the body.

00:06:58,591 --> 00:07:00,860
Vega didn't need
to lay a finger on Bowden.

00:07:01,894 --> 00:07:03,996
Yeah, you're right.

00:07:03,996 --> 00:07:06,332
Well...

00:07:06,332 --> 00:07:08,400
I'm glad you told me.

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,804
So, let's go rally
the troops, shall we?

00:07:11,804 --> 00:07:14,907
See if forensics can do
what police work couldn't.

00:07:18,644 --> 00:07:21,647
STOKES: That's the victim,
Robert James.

00:07:21,647 --> 00:07:24,650
On May 7, 2005, he and a buddy
went drinking in a bar.

00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,485
He left early to walk home.

00:07:26,485 --> 00:07:29,054
The quickest way to do that was
to cut through a nearby alley.

00:07:29,054 --> 00:07:30,623
He never made it.
The next morning,

00:07:30,623 --> 00:07:32,391
Robert's mother
reported him missing.

00:07:32,391 --> 00:07:33,692
And the call-out was

00:07:33,692 --> 00:07:35,928
a suspicious blood pool
near a dumpster.

00:07:35,928 --> 00:07:38,564
I ran the DNA; matched
the blood in the alley

00:07:38,564 --> 00:07:40,799
to DNA from
Robert's toothbrush.

00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:43,669
Next day, Vega got a lead
on a suspect, a guy named

00:07:43,669 --> 00:07:45,804
Carl Bowden,
who confessed to the crime,

00:07:45,804 --> 00:07:48,007
and took us out to the body
near Red Rock.

00:07:48,007 --> 00:07:49,875
Ended up cutting a deal
with the DA.

00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:51,076
Oh. So no trial.

00:07:51,076 --> 00:07:52,811
Means you had
to box up the evidence

00:07:52,811 --> 00:07:54,580
and send it off
to the freezer.
Right.

00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:57,483
Unfortunately, a lot of the case
evidence has been excluded,

00:07:57,483 --> 00:07:58,951
thanks to Detective Vega.

00:07:58,951 --> 00:08:00,386
Confession, gone.

00:08:00,386 --> 00:08:01,787
Robert James' body

00:08:01,787 --> 00:08:04,523
and everything found
at the dump site-- gone.

00:08:04,523 --> 00:08:08,093
Doc Robbins'
autopsy results-- gone.

00:08:08,093 --> 00:08:10,029
So, that's all
we have left?

00:08:10,029 --> 00:08:12,698
We have an alley crime scene.

00:08:12,698 --> 00:08:15,367
We have a missing person report
and an eyewitness.

00:08:15,367 --> 00:08:16,835
We've worked with a lot less.

00:08:16,835 --> 00:08:18,837
Morgan's on her way back
from long-term storage

00:08:18,837 --> 00:08:20,539
with all the evidence
from the alley.

00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:22,341
Greg, I want you
to help her go through that.

00:08:22,341 --> 00:08:24,410
All right?
You got it.

00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:26,712
Finn, Nick and I will go
to the alley.

00:08:26,712 --> 00:08:28,580
I want to take a look
at that scene.

00:08:35,554 --> 00:08:37,456
Okay, this is right
around the area

00:08:37,456 --> 00:08:39,825
where the crime
occurred, right here.

00:08:39,825 --> 00:08:41,627
Look the same
as it did seven years ago?

00:08:41,627 --> 00:08:43,062
Oh, in this part of town,

00:08:43,062 --> 00:08:45,497
nothing ever really
changes that much.

00:08:45,497 --> 00:08:47,700
Except this dumpster,
or one like it,

00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,034
was over there.

00:08:49,034 --> 00:08:50,536
And, uh,

00:08:50,536 --> 00:08:52,571
where was the blood pool?

00:08:52,571 --> 00:08:54,640
It was right over here,
near the dumpster.

00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,375
And there was also
fresh urine

00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:58,610
that Greg matched
to Robert James.

00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:00,412
Near the blood pool, there was

00:09:00,412 --> 00:09:02,381
a busted cinder block
with blood on it.

00:09:02,381 --> 00:09:04,383
Weapon of opportunity.

00:09:04,383 --> 00:09:06,518
Bowden grabbed one, hit Robert
over the head with it.

00:09:09,421 --> 00:09:10,923
(grunting)

00:09:10,923 --> 00:09:13,025
Was there any blood spatter
from the initial blows?

00:09:13,025 --> 00:09:14,893
All of the blood spatter

00:09:14,893 --> 00:09:16,362
was low to the ground

00:09:16,362 --> 00:09:17,896
and contained in
this area right here.

00:09:17,896 --> 00:09:20,399
Means that
Bowden kept hitting him,

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,700
even after he was down.

00:09:25,971 --> 00:09:28,073
Yeah, I found brain matter
in the blood pool.

00:09:28,073 --> 00:09:30,442
That kid never walked
out of this alley.

00:09:30,442 --> 00:09:32,344
All right, so, based on
what we have-- blood,

00:09:32,344 --> 00:09:34,413
urine, murder weapon--

00:09:34,413 --> 00:09:36,081
we know that Robert James
was killed here.

00:09:36,081 --> 00:09:38,617
Yeah, we just can't say
that Bowden was the guy

00:09:38,617 --> 00:09:40,886
that did it, legally.

00:09:40,886 --> 00:09:43,389
What about
your eyewitness?
Yeah.

00:09:43,389 --> 00:09:45,057
She was getting into her
car across the street.

00:09:48,961 --> 00:09:51,330
<i>She said she saw Bowden</i>
<i>leaving the alley.</i>

00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:52,531
Without the body?

00:09:52,531 --> 00:09:54,099
Well, there were
no drag marks.

00:09:54,099 --> 00:09:56,001
I figured he was just
going to his car,

00:09:56,001 --> 00:09:57,536
which we never found.

00:09:57,536 --> 00:09:59,705
That's too bad.

00:09:59,705 --> 00:10:01,473
Okay, anything else?
Anything

00:10:01,473 --> 00:10:03,509
maybe you didn't put
in your notebook on the day?

00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:07,613
Well, actually,
I did smell something.

00:10:07,613 --> 00:10:08,914
It was like a
chemical smell.

00:10:08,914 --> 00:10:11,016
Like a solvent.

00:10:11,016 --> 00:10:12,684
Couple of restaurants around.

00:10:12,684 --> 00:10:14,653
Maybe it was an industrial
cleaner or something.

00:10:14,653 --> 00:10:15,854
No, no.

00:10:15,854 --> 00:10:17,956
It was more like... Superglue,

00:10:17,956 --> 00:10:20,059
(distant sirens wailing)
but different.

00:10:20,059 --> 00:10:21,527
And at the time, I just thought

00:10:21,527 --> 00:10:25,764
it was something
in the dumpster.

00:10:25,764 --> 00:10:26,965
Captain?

00:10:26,965 --> 00:10:28,600
Detective Moreno.

00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,035
Come in, come in.

00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:35,474
I heard you're reworking
a homicide case

00:10:35,474 --> 00:10:36,975
my old man screwed up.

00:10:36,975 --> 00:10:39,511
Yeah, you heard right, yeah.

00:10:39,511 --> 00:10:43,348
Sit down.

00:10:43,348 --> 00:10:46,752
So, these past
few months, uh...

00:10:46,752 --> 00:10:48,921
been kind of rough, huh?

00:10:48,921 --> 00:10:50,689
You know, before all
of this happened,

00:10:50,689 --> 00:10:53,826
not a lot of cops even knew
that Sam was my dad.

00:10:53,826 --> 00:10:55,694
Well, my stepdad.

00:10:55,694 --> 00:10:57,930
You know, back in
the neighborhood

00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:00,632
that I grew up in in
LA, it was tough.

00:11:00,632 --> 00:11:01,834
I mean, real tough.

00:11:01,834 --> 00:11:03,335
If it weren't for Sam,

00:11:03,335 --> 00:11:04,870
well... I might have
gone the wrong way.

00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,071
Sure.

00:11:06,071 --> 00:11:07,473
We all miss him.

00:11:09,508 --> 00:11:12,878
Captain Brass...

00:11:12,878 --> 00:11:14,680
I want to work this case.

00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,881
Oh, I don't know...

00:11:15,881 --> 00:11:17,950
Look, after my dad died,

00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:20,652
I was dragged in front of IAB,
so you know that I'm clean.

00:11:20,652 --> 00:11:22,321
I'll work this
on my own time.

00:11:22,321 --> 00:11:24,056
I'll run leads,
I'll find witnesses.

00:11:24,056 --> 00:11:26,525
Sir, I will do what
you need me to do.

00:11:26,525 --> 00:11:28,360
I need to do this.

00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,828
I, I got to try to
make this right.

00:11:29,828 --> 00:11:31,430
Look, I get it, I get it.

00:11:33,065 --> 00:11:35,767
I don't think it's a good idea.

00:11:41,373 --> 00:11:45,811
But, look, if we do this,
it has to be unofficial.

00:11:45,811 --> 00:11:48,580
Understood?

00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,815
Now get out of here.

00:11:49,815 --> 00:11:51,917
Thank you.

00:11:57,789 --> 00:11:59,791
Just talked to Nick.

00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:01,693
He remembered something
from the alley--

00:12:01,693 --> 00:12:04,463
a smell, kind of like a solvent.

00:12:04,463 --> 00:12:05,898
Really?

00:12:05,898 --> 00:12:07,699
I'm guessing that's
why Russell wanted

00:12:07,699 --> 00:12:08,901
to go back there.

00:12:08,901 --> 00:12:10,536
To jog Nick's memory.

00:12:10,536 --> 00:12:12,871
Grissom used to teach
by Socratic method.

00:12:12,871 --> 00:12:15,541
At least you knew when it
was happening, but Russell...

00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:16,808
You never know,
and by the time

00:12:16,808 --> 00:12:18,443
you figured it out,
it's already over.

00:12:19,611 --> 00:12:21,880
All right, here's your half.

00:12:22,881 --> 00:12:25,350
I'll print, you swab.

00:12:45,504 --> 00:12:48,106
STOKES: Seven years is a long
time to keep a car in impound.

00:12:48,106 --> 00:12:50,442
BRASS:
Well, when we tag evidence
"Hold for Homicide,"

00:12:50,442 --> 00:12:52,010
it doesn't go anywhere.
You know,

00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:53,612
I didn't even know Bowden's
car had been recovered.

00:12:53,612 --> 00:12:55,314
No, neither did I.

00:12:55,314 --> 00:12:57,382
It was picked up at a 7-Eleven
the night of the murder.

00:12:57,382 --> 00:12:58,817
That's two blocks
away from the alley.

00:12:58,817 --> 00:13:00,052
The tow company
didn't inform us

00:13:00,052 --> 00:13:01,687
till after Bowden confessed.

00:13:01,687 --> 00:13:03,689
Then it was tagged and towed
and brought over here.

00:13:03,689 --> 00:13:05,490
There, that's it.

00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:08,927
If Bowden did use this car to
transport Robert James' body,

00:13:08,927 --> 00:13:11,330
we might still find
some evidence in it.

00:13:18,971 --> 00:13:20,806
(sniffs)

00:13:20,806 --> 00:13:22,441
Little late for that
new car smell, huh?

00:13:22,441 --> 00:13:23,642
(laughs)

00:13:23,642 --> 00:13:26,578
Well, it's faint, but

00:13:26,578 --> 00:13:28,814
it might be what I smelled
back in that alley.

00:13:28,814 --> 00:13:31,483
Car's been sealed
for seven years.

00:13:31,483 --> 00:13:34,453
That steering wheel cover
is leather, it's absorbent.

00:13:34,453 --> 00:13:35,687
Might be worth a shot.

00:13:35,687 --> 00:13:38,490
Got significant
front end damage.

00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:40,525
You know...

00:13:40,525 --> 00:13:41,760
I think I figured out
why this car

00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,395
was illegally parked
at the 7-Eleven.

00:13:43,395 --> 00:13:44,596
MORENO:
Me, too.

00:13:44,596 --> 00:13:46,865
This car was involved
in a hit and run.

00:13:46,865 --> 00:13:48,333
Detective Moreno.

00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:49,601
So what's up?

00:13:49,601 --> 00:13:50,802
Is Vice in on this now?

00:13:50,802 --> 00:13:52,004
MORENO:
No, I'm just, uh,

00:13:52,004 --> 00:13:53,672
hanging out
on my day off

00:13:53,672 --> 00:13:56,408
and taking care
of a little family business.

00:13:56,408 --> 00:13:58,310
Right.

00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:00,479
So, did Bowden hit someone?

00:14:00,479 --> 00:14:02,581
No, actually, somebody hit
his car and took off.

00:14:02,581 --> 00:14:03,815
Car was parked
at the 7-Eleven,

00:14:03,815 --> 00:14:05,017
the clerk called it in.

00:14:05,017 --> 00:14:06,418
Did Patrol talk to Bowden?

00:14:06,418 --> 00:14:07,619
Nope, couldn't find him.

00:14:07,619 --> 00:14:08,820
What time was that?

00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,055
10:00.

00:14:10,055 --> 00:14:11,690
STOKES: You know,
that's right around

00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:13,425
the same time
Robert James left that bar.

00:14:13,425 --> 00:14:15,594
Yeah, and the patrol noted
that the car wasn't drivable,

00:14:15,594 --> 00:14:16,995
which means

00:14:16,995 --> 00:14:18,697
this car didn't go
anywhere after 10:00.

00:14:18,697 --> 00:14:21,433
So Robert James' body
was never in it.

00:14:26,338 --> 00:14:28,006
Octyl cyanoacrylate.

00:14:28,006 --> 00:14:30,475
Gesundheit.

00:14:30,475 --> 00:14:32,444
No, it's what Nick
smelled in the alley.

00:14:32,444 --> 00:14:34,346
We found traces of it
on the murder weapon.

00:14:34,346 --> 00:14:36,948
What is it exactly?

00:14:36,948 --> 00:14:38,483
It's a kind of
liquid bandage called

00:14:38,483 --> 00:14:39,685
Invi-Skin.

00:14:39,685 --> 00:14:40,919
<i>You put it on an open wound</i>

00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:42,921
<i>like a new layer of skin.</i>

00:14:42,921 --> 00:14:44,423
It smells bad,
but it works,

00:14:44,423 --> 00:14:45,791
and the best part is,

00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:47,759
we found it on a part
of the cinder block

00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:49,661
that was not covered in blood.

00:14:49,661 --> 00:14:52,831
So it could be a transfer
from the killer's hand.

00:14:55,767 --> 00:14:57,402
Athletes use it to
stop the bleeding--

00:14:57,402 --> 00:14:59,071
otherwise they'll get
pulled out of the game--

00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,839
but primarily

00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:03,342
it's used by tradesmen
who work with their hands.

00:15:03,342 --> 00:15:06,311
And Carl Bowden was a mechanic.

00:15:07,846 --> 00:15:09,848
Great.

00:15:15,821 --> 00:15:18,023
Listen, I've hired some
sketchy guys over the years.

00:15:18,023 --> 00:15:20,525
Some of 'em have even
done time, nothing big.

00:15:20,525 --> 00:15:22,828
Carl was the only one
who ever killed anybody.

00:15:22,828 --> 00:15:25,497
So do you remember him well?

00:15:25,497 --> 00:15:26,698
Remember him?

00:15:26,698 --> 00:15:28,834
I'll never forget.

00:15:28,834 --> 00:15:30,802
My wife and I
were watching TV.

00:15:30,802 --> 00:15:32,738
She said, "Isn't that Carl?"

00:15:32,738 --> 00:15:34,339
Well, there he
was, on the news,

00:15:34,339 --> 00:15:36,074
leading you folks
to the boy's body.

00:15:36,074 --> 00:15:37,943
Mr. Gerard,
we need your help.

00:15:37,943 --> 00:15:39,378
What can you tell us about Carl?

00:15:39,378 --> 00:15:41,079
Real hothead.

00:15:41,079 --> 00:15:42,814
Littlest thing
would set him off.

00:15:42,814 --> 00:15:45,550
Guys around here gave
him a wide berth.

00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,785
I don't think they'd admit it,

00:15:46,785 --> 00:15:49,321
but I think
they were scared of him.

00:15:49,321 --> 00:15:51,690
I only kept him around because
he was such a good mechanic.

00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:53,558
The guy could fix anything.

00:15:53,558 --> 00:15:55,660
And what about the day
that Robert James was murdered?

00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,928
Anything set
him off then?

00:15:56,928 --> 00:15:58,397
The wife left him.

00:15:58,397 --> 00:15:59,931
Cleaned out the apartment.

00:15:59,931 --> 00:16:02,467
Oh, he was pretty steamed
when he got back to work.

00:16:02,467 --> 00:16:04,870
Grabbed a crowbar-- I thought
he was going to use it on me.

00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,838
Took it out on the
vending machine.

00:16:06,838 --> 00:16:10,409
Did, uh, Mr. Bowden have access
to the shop after hours?

00:16:10,409 --> 00:16:12,511
Sure, he had
a set of keys.

00:16:12,511 --> 00:16:14,312
And what about the vehicles
left overnight?

00:16:14,312 --> 00:16:15,514
Did he have access to those?

00:16:15,514 --> 00:16:17,849
Got to have keys to fix 'em.

00:16:17,849 --> 00:16:20,352
Hmm?

00:16:20,352 --> 00:16:23,555
Do you happen to keep records
from, like, seven years ago?

00:16:23,555 --> 00:16:24,756
You bet.

00:16:24,756 --> 00:16:26,558
I never throw anything away.

00:16:26,558 --> 00:16:27,959
IRS.
Well,
we'd like to know

00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:30,429
which vehicles
were left overnight

00:16:30,429 --> 00:16:32,364
on May 7, 2005.

00:16:32,364 --> 00:16:33,632
(sighs)

00:16:33,632 --> 00:16:34,833
I'll dig 'em up.

00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:36,034
Let's go to the office.

00:16:36,034 --> 00:16:38,036
I'll catch up.

00:16:55,654 --> 00:16:57,656
How you doing?

00:16:57,656 --> 00:17:00,358
Better now.

00:17:00,358 --> 00:17:02,627
Can I see your hands?

00:17:02,627 --> 00:17:04,029
You can see
whatever you want.

00:17:04,029 --> 00:17:06,031
Just your hands.

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,601
(sniffs)

00:17:09,601 --> 00:17:11,069
They smell.

00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:12,704
It's not oil;
what is that?

00:17:12,704 --> 00:17:14,473
Ah, it's just some
stuff I put on 'em

00:17:14,473 --> 00:17:16,308
'cause they're always
cracking and bleeding.

00:17:16,308 --> 00:17:17,642
Invi-Skin.

00:17:17,642 --> 00:17:19,044
Yeah, that's it.

00:17:19,044 --> 00:17:21,613
Thanks.

00:17:23,882 --> 00:17:25,917
The department mechanic
checked out Bowden's car.

00:17:25,917 --> 00:17:28,053
He said it runs
fine but confirmed

00:17:28,053 --> 00:17:30,422
that the front end damage
made it undrivable.

00:17:30,422 --> 00:17:32,424
So Bowden walks
out of the 7-Eleven...

00:17:33,492 --> 00:17:35,660
<i>...sees his car all smashed up.</i>

00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,329
<i>He was already having</i>
<i>a bad day,</i>

00:17:37,329 --> 00:17:38,997
<i>so that probably pushed him</i>
<i>over the edge.</i>

00:17:38,997 --> 00:17:40,665
And after he killed
Robert James,

00:17:40,665 --> 00:17:43,101
he needed another car
to get rid of the body.

00:17:43,101 --> 00:17:45,704
Well, Ben's garage had
three cars stored that night.

00:17:45,704 --> 00:17:47,506
Two of them had
their engine pulled.

00:17:47,506 --> 00:17:49,341
So he couldn't have driven
either one of those.

00:17:49,341 --> 00:17:50,609
What's up with him?

00:17:50,609 --> 00:17:52,777
STOKES (laughs):
Ah, he went

00:17:52,777 --> 00:17:54,045
to Italy with his mom.

00:17:54,045 --> 00:17:55,747
I think he brought
it back with him.

00:17:55,747 --> 00:17:57,649
Well, the only other car
in the garage that night

00:17:57,649 --> 00:17:58,850
was getting a tune-up--

00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:00,552
a Buick Park Avenue.

00:18:00,552 --> 00:18:02,387
Ooh, got a big trunk.
Yeah.

00:18:02,387 --> 00:18:04,389
Big enough to hold a body.

00:18:04,389 --> 00:18:05,891
I tracked it down,
here it is.

00:18:05,891 --> 00:18:08,827
Nice.

00:18:09,861 --> 00:18:13,031
♪ ♪

00:18:39,391 --> 00:18:42,093
I got blood.

00:18:43,562 --> 00:18:45,564
<i>Ti voglio bene.</i>

00:18:45,564 --> 00:18:47,465
<i>Devo andare.</i>

00:18:47,465 --> 00:18:49,334
Hmm.

00:18:49,334 --> 00:18:50,802
I didn't know you spoke Italian.

00:18:50,802 --> 00:18:54,372
<i>Si, italiano é la lingua</i>
<i>dell'amore.</i>

00:18:54,372 --> 00:18:57,008
Oh, I always thought the
language of love was français.

00:18:57,008 --> 00:18:58,743
Only to the French.

00:18:58,743 --> 00:19:00,412
Touché.

00:19:00,412 --> 00:19:02,347
So, any luck with
the liquid bandage stuff?

00:19:02,347 --> 00:19:03,615
Yes.

00:19:03,615 --> 00:19:05,050
The stuff on your
mechanic's hands

00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:06,585
was the same chemical
that I found

00:19:06,585 --> 00:19:08,386
on the cinder block
and the leather

00:19:08,386 --> 00:19:09,988
steering wheel cover
found in Bowden's car.

00:19:09,988 --> 00:19:11,990
That's good, right?

00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:13,592
It puts Bowden in the alley.

00:19:13,592 --> 00:19:15,460
Yeah, well, him and
a lot of other guys.

00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,928
Did some research.

00:19:16,928 --> 00:19:19,364
It's the top-selling
liquid bandage in the U.S.

00:19:19,364 --> 00:19:21,099
Okay.

00:19:21,099 --> 00:19:22,500
Still waiting
for our home run.

00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,735
(laughs)

00:19:23,735 --> 00:19:25,003
Why don't you try
across the hall.

00:19:26,538 --> 00:19:28,673
Do you know where
I've been every night

00:19:28,673 --> 00:19:29,841
for the last
two weeks?
No.

00:19:29,841 --> 00:19:31,743
The batting cages
with Finn,

00:19:31,743 --> 00:19:33,645
and I've been
hitting, man, I mean,

00:19:33,645 --> 00:19:35,680
the balls have been
screaming off my bat.

00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:38,750
So it may have looked like
I was going to hurl up at bat,

00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,418
but I was ready.
All right, bud.

00:19:40,418 --> 00:19:41,720
I'm sorry.
I didn't know it meant

00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,921
that much to you.

00:19:42,921 --> 00:19:44,322
Does this mean
you're not gonna

00:19:44,322 --> 00:19:45,523
analyze DNA
for me anymore?

00:19:45,523 --> 00:19:47,626
Please,
I'm a professional.

00:19:47,626 --> 00:19:48,994
I got your DNA results

00:19:48,994 --> 00:19:51,062
on the blood you found
in the trunk of that Buick.

00:19:51,062 --> 00:19:52,831
Please tell me it's a
match to Robert James.

00:19:52,831 --> 00:19:54,899
It was degraded,
which is to be expected,

00:19:54,899 --> 00:19:56,701
so the stats aren't
as good as we usually get.

00:19:56,701 --> 00:19:57,902
So give it to me.

00:19:57,902 --> 00:19:59,971
One in 43,000.

00:19:59,971 --> 00:20:01,373
(sighs)

00:20:01,373 --> 00:20:02,540
What about Bowden?

00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,775
Anything to tie
him to the car?

00:20:03,775 --> 00:20:05,977
No. I even ran his profile
through CODIS.

00:20:05,977 --> 00:20:07,379
No hits.

00:20:07,379 --> 00:20:09,047
MELVOY:
<i>That's it?</i>

00:20:09,047 --> 00:20:12,450
A weak DNA result that could be,

00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:13,852
possibly, Robert James...

00:20:13,852 --> 00:20:15,720
and no evidence of
Bowden, DNA or otherwise.

00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,889
He did have access
to the Buick

00:20:17,889 --> 00:20:20,592
and his own car places him
three blocks from the scene

00:20:20,592 --> 00:20:21,793
at the time
of the murder.

00:20:21,793 --> 00:20:22,994
It wasn't drivable,

00:20:22,994 --> 00:20:24,763
which explains why he needed

00:20:24,763 --> 00:20:26,564
the customer's Buick
to move Robert's body.

00:20:26,564 --> 00:20:30,502
Eyewitness said she saw Bowden
exit the alley on foot.

00:20:30,502 --> 00:20:32,671
Yeah, a witness that died of
breast cancer two years ago.

00:20:32,671 --> 00:20:34,539
She can't testify
to anything.

00:20:34,539 --> 00:20:36,508
Look, I-I'm sorry, I can't
move forward with this.

00:20:36,508 --> 00:20:38,343
It's not enough.
Well, shouldn't we let

00:20:38,343 --> 00:20:39,811
a jury decide that?
If we retry Bowden,

00:20:39,811 --> 00:20:41,713
we have to win.

00:20:41,713 --> 00:20:42,981
The bar is high
when you're trying

00:20:42,981 --> 00:20:44,516
to fight off the
stink of a dirty cop.

00:20:44,516 --> 00:20:46,051
Bowden murdered Robert James.

00:20:46,051 --> 00:20:48,053
Vega's instinct about
him was right.
Yeah,

00:20:48,053 --> 00:20:50,655
but his instinct about
beating a confession
out of him wasn't.

00:20:50,655 --> 00:20:51,990
All right, all right.

00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:55,326
Look, Bowden's
served seven years.

00:20:55,326 --> 00:20:56,828
It's not 25, but
it's something.

00:20:56,828 --> 00:20:58,396
Yeah, and he should have
gotten life.

00:20:58,396 --> 00:20:59,597
You've seen the pictures

00:20:59,597 --> 00:21:01,099
of Robert James.
Yeah, Bowden beat

00:21:01,099 --> 00:21:03,368
an innocent man to death--
a man he didn't even know--

00:21:03,368 --> 00:21:04,736
for no apparent reason.

00:21:04,736 --> 00:21:06,471
You put a guy like that
back on the street,

00:21:06,471 --> 00:21:07,672
he is going to do it again.

00:21:07,672 --> 00:21:08,873
Just a matter of time.

00:21:08,873 --> 00:21:10,775
I don't disagree with you.

00:21:10,775 --> 00:21:12,777
And if you find more
evidence down the road,

00:21:12,777 --> 00:21:13,978
we can refile then.

00:21:13,978 --> 00:21:15,680
So Bowden walks?

00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,881
As soon as I
present the motion

00:21:16,881 --> 00:21:18,083
to dismiss to the judge.

00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,617
A-At least

00:21:19,617 --> 00:21:21,453
let me take some new
reference samples first.

00:21:21,453 --> 00:21:22,821
Our samples are

00:21:22,821 --> 00:21:24,355
seven years old.

00:21:24,355 --> 00:21:25,890
Couldn't hurt
to confirm everything.

00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:28,693
All right, but, Nick,
you can't talk to him

00:21:28,693 --> 00:21:30,095
and I'll have
to notify his attorney.

00:21:30,095 --> 00:21:31,596
Fine.

00:21:31,596 --> 00:21:33,064
Set it up.

00:21:50,648 --> 00:21:53,451
Long time.

00:22:00,792 --> 00:22:03,428
I'm gonna need to take some
reference samples from you.

00:22:03,428 --> 00:22:05,797
If I don't give 'em up...

00:22:05,797 --> 00:22:08,099
are you gonna hit me?

00:22:08,099 --> 00:22:10,802
(clears throat softly)

00:22:10,802 --> 00:22:12,370
Open up.

00:22:21,946 --> 00:22:24,916
I'm gonna need to take
some pictures, too.

00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,723
Red isn't my best color.

00:22:31,723 --> 00:22:35,059
But then again, I won't
be wearing it much longer.

00:22:47,539 --> 00:22:49,374
Hands.

00:23:01,386 --> 00:23:03,688
STOKES:
<i>Bowden had scars</i>
<i>all over his body.</i>

00:23:03,688 --> 00:23:06,758
According to the warden,
he gets in fights all the time,

00:23:06,758 --> 00:23:08,426
most of which
he starts himself.

00:23:08,426 --> 00:23:10,595
Yeah, you know,
his old boss said

00:23:10,595 --> 00:23:13,364
that he had a
hair-trigger temper.
Yeah, man,

00:23:13,364 --> 00:23:15,333
he's got some serious
anger issues.

00:23:15,333 --> 00:23:17,535
The James murder was
vicious and unprovoked.

00:23:17,535 --> 00:23:19,037
Total overkill.
Yeah,

00:23:19,037 --> 00:23:20,872
prison's not gonna change
that kind of anger.

00:23:20,872 --> 00:23:22,373
No way.

00:23:22,373 --> 00:23:24,375
You know, I don't think
that kind of anger

00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:25,610
developed overnight, either.

00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:27,078
Mm-mm.
No, a hothead
like Carl

00:23:27,078 --> 00:23:29,914
must have taken his anger
out on someone before.

00:23:29,914 --> 00:23:31,416
I think it's a
good possibility

00:23:31,416 --> 00:23:34,686
there were other victims
before Mr. James.

00:23:34,686 --> 00:23:37,355
Okay, here's what
we're gonna do.

00:23:37,355 --> 00:23:39,057
We're not going home.
We're gonna take

00:23:39,057 --> 00:23:41,826
a look at all the old cases
with similar MO's, right?

00:23:41,826 --> 00:23:43,061
Ambush beatings,

00:23:43,061 --> 00:23:44,462
seemingly random.

00:23:44,462 --> 00:23:45,797
Weapons of opportunity.

00:23:45,797 --> 00:23:47,098
Yeah, I'm down.
If we can't keep him

00:23:47,098 --> 00:23:48,733
locked up for
the James murder,

00:23:48,733 --> 00:23:51,469
maybe we can keep him
in there for something else.

00:23:51,469 --> 00:23:52,770
Damn right.

00:24:00,578 --> 00:24:02,680
I searched VICAP for keywords:
"ambush," "beating,"

00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,915
"weapon of opportunity."

00:24:03,915 --> 00:24:05,516
Found two cases

00:24:05,516 --> 00:24:08,086
with similar MO's--
one in St. George, Utah,

00:24:08,086 --> 00:24:09,854
the other in Laughlin.

00:24:09,854 --> 00:24:12,590
Both male victims,
one year before
the murder.

00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:13,925
Okay, worth checking out.

00:24:13,925 --> 00:24:15,326
And I got one, as well,

00:24:15,326 --> 00:24:16,661
from our department,

00:24:16,661 --> 00:24:18,463
but it might just be
a straight mugging.

00:24:18,463 --> 00:24:19,831
Where'd you disappear to?

00:24:19,831 --> 00:24:21,399
I was in the basement.

00:24:21,399 --> 00:24:23,368
I think I found a possible case.

00:24:24,903 --> 00:24:27,438
Random attack on a jogger,

00:24:27,438 --> 00:24:29,707
almost beaten to death,
in a park,

00:24:29,707 --> 00:24:30,942
with a log.

00:24:30,942 --> 00:24:32,744
Weapon of opportunity.
FINLAY:
Yes,

00:24:32,744 --> 00:24:34,512
and according
to the police report,

00:24:34,512 --> 00:24:36,948
officers noticed
a distinct chemical smell.

00:24:36,948 --> 00:24:38,349
Ooh.

00:24:38,349 --> 00:24:39,784
All right, I like
where this is going.

00:24:39,784 --> 00:24:41,653
FINLAY: There are some
minor differences.

00:24:41,653 --> 00:24:44,522
The victim was a female,
she was attacked during the day,

00:24:44,522 --> 00:24:45,924
and she did survive.

00:24:45,924 --> 00:24:48,393
Bowden killed Robert James
at night, in an alley,

00:24:48,393 --> 00:24:49,994
and then he dumped the body.

00:24:49,994 --> 00:24:52,664
Why would he leave this victim
alive and out in the open?

00:24:52,664 --> 00:24:53,898
Maybe he was interrupted.

00:24:53,898 --> 00:24:55,366
Exactly.

00:24:55,366 --> 00:24:57,368
There is a catch.
RUSSELL:
Yeah.

00:24:57,368 --> 00:24:59,704
Someone's already been
convicted for the crime.

00:24:59,704 --> 00:25:00,972
Big catch.
Yeah.

00:25:00,972 --> 00:25:02,974
I know.
But no case is perfect.

00:25:02,974 --> 00:25:05,310
STOKES:
Well, that's okay, that's okay.
Let's hear it.

00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:07,512
All right. 2004,

00:25:07,512 --> 00:25:09,647
<i>April Reynolds is out</i>
<i>on her afternoon run</i>

00:25:09,647 --> 00:25:10,848
<i>in Tresser Park.</i>

00:25:10,848 --> 00:25:12,450
<i>She's listening to music,</i>

00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:14,585
<i>so she does not hear</i>
<i>her attacker</i>

00:25:14,585 --> 00:25:16,054
<i>come up from behind.</i>

00:25:16,054 --> 00:25:18,656
(April yelling)
<i>He drags her into the bushes,</i>

00:25:18,656 --> 00:25:21,993
<i>and she is almost</i>
<i>beaten to death.</i>

00:25:21,993 --> 00:25:23,428
Any sign of sexual assault?

00:25:23,428 --> 00:25:25,396
Uh, no.
Just like
Robert James,

00:25:25,396 --> 00:25:27,765
nothing was taken--
not her MP3 player,

00:25:27,765 --> 00:25:29,934
her watch or her wedding ring.
Yeah,

00:25:29,934 --> 00:25:32,937
usually when somebody sustains
a blow to the head like that,

00:25:32,937 --> 00:25:34,973
the goal is
to incapacitate them,

00:25:34,973 --> 00:25:36,708
to take them down.

00:25:36,708 --> 00:25:39,911
And when April Reynolds woke up,
she identified her attacker as

00:25:39,911 --> 00:25:42,914
this guy, David Jorgensen,
her best friend's husband.

00:25:42,914 --> 00:25:45,616
But he has always
maintained his innocence,

00:25:45,616 --> 00:25:48,052
and the physical evidence
is pretty weak.

00:25:48,052 --> 00:25:49,988
Yet shoe prints
found at the crime scene

00:25:49,988 --> 00:25:51,990
matched a pair that
Jorgensen owned,

00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:53,624
but they were size ten Nikes.

00:25:53,624 --> 00:25:55,727
That's a popular brand.
Jorgensen

00:25:55,727 --> 00:25:57,495
had wood splinters
in his hands,

00:25:57,495 --> 00:25:59,964
same kind of wood as the log
used to beat April.

00:25:59,964 --> 00:26:01,799
BRODY:
And shortly
after the attack

00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:04,869
neighbors reported seeing David
burning things in the backyard.

00:26:04,869 --> 00:26:07,438
I'm sorry, that
always sounds suspicious.

00:26:07,438 --> 00:26:08,940
Link to Bowden
seems like a stretch.

00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,441
Mm.
Okay,
what about

00:26:10,441 --> 00:26:11,943
the chemical smell
at both crime scenes?

00:26:11,943 --> 00:26:13,845
That's got to be
something, right?
Yeah.

00:26:13,845 --> 00:26:16,014
That cannot be
a coincidence; no way.
All right, let's

00:26:16,014 --> 00:26:18,016
take a look at the evidence
and find out, all right?

00:26:18,016 --> 00:26:19,717
Hodges will run

the victim--

00:26:21,019 --> 00:26:23,488
why don't you go ahead
and track her down.

00:26:23,488 --> 00:26:25,590
Morgan, go ahead and pull
April's medical files.

00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:26,958
I'm gonna go talk
to David Jorgensen.

00:26:26,958 --> 00:26:28,860
Got to be more to the story.

00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:31,462
I'll see if I can place Bowden
anywhere near the park that day.

00:26:31,462 --> 00:26:33,464

According to Bowden's
credit card records,

his card was declined
at a liquor store

declined is not enough

I know you were in the room
with Bowden and my old man

00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:14,699
that day.
Mm-hmm.

00:28:14,699 --> 00:28:17,602

Okay, look.

00:28:31,382 --> 00:28:33,618
I left the room.

00:28:33,618 --> 00:28:35,052
When I came back in,

00:28:35,052 --> 00:28:37,655
Bowden had a split lip
and a black eye.

00:28:37,655 --> 00:28:39,457
Your dad said that
Bowden jumped him.

maybe I didn't want to.

Well, if it makes you
feel any better,

00:29:02,046 --> 00:29:05,349
I didn't know about
the rest of it, either.

(laughs softly)

00:29:07,351 --> 00:29:10,621

all I wanted was to be like him.

the whole thing. (sighs)

00:29:13,724 --> 00:29:16,694
He used to say to me,
"You're not cut out for this."

00:29:16,694 --> 00:29:18,596
And I used to think, you know,

00:29:18,596 --> 00:29:20,731
it was because
I wasn't tough enough.

00:29:20,731 --> 00:29:23,501
Lately, I
realize that...

00:29:23,501 --> 00:29:26,370
to him, doing the job...

00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:29,073
meant getting your hands dirty.

00:29:29,073 --> 00:29:31,375
He was just trying
to protect you.

00:29:31,375 --> 00:29:33,644
Sammy was a good guy.

00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:36,714

00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:41,552
Hmm.

00:29:41,552 --> 00:29:44,555
All right, I just got an e-mail
from the guy that Bowden

00:29:44,555 --> 00:29:46,057
used to work for in 2004.

00:29:46,057 --> 00:29:48,559
Stokes, you're
gonna love this.

00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:51,462
Bowden was fired
on May the seventh.
Okay,

00:29:51,462 --> 00:29:53,664
that's the same day that
April Reynolds was attacked.

00:29:53,664 --> 00:29:55,466
Yeah, and that's
one hell of a trigger.

00:29:55,466 --> 00:29:56,968
Okay, so Bowden gets
his walking papers,

00:29:56,968 --> 00:29:59,437
he goes to the liquor store
to drown his sorrows,

00:29:59,437 --> 00:30:00,738
his credit card is declined...

00:30:00,738 --> 00:30:02,406
And now he's really pissed,

00:30:02,406 --> 00:30:04,408
<i>so he goes across the street</i>
<i>to Tresser Park,</i>

00:30:04,408 --> 00:30:06,444
<i>and he sees</i>
<i>April Reynolds jogging.</i>

we can prove it.

00:30:23,494 --> 00:30:26,397
Mr. Jorgensen,
I've studied your case file,

00:30:26,397 --> 00:30:29,700
and I would like to ask
you a few questions.
After eight years?

00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,469
Now you want to talk to me?

00:30:31,469 --> 00:30:34,572
I was not aware of your
case eight years ago.

00:30:34,572 --> 00:30:36,107
I am now,
and I very much

00:30:36,107 --> 00:30:38,609
want to hear your
side of the story.

00:30:38,609 --> 00:30:40,711
It's the same
as it's always been.

00:30:40,711 --> 00:30:42,480
I'm innocent.

00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,048
David Jorgensen
almost killed me.

00:30:44,048 --> 00:30:45,883
How can you even think

00:30:45,883 --> 00:30:47,952
about letting him out?
Ms. Reynolds,

00:30:47,952 --> 00:30:49,887
you know, we're just
looking into the case.

00:30:49,887 --> 00:30:53,457
So please, sit down.

00:30:53,457 --> 00:30:55,760
Sit down.
I-I didn't mean
to snap at you.

00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,929
It's just, well,
these last eight years, it's...

00:30:58,929 --> 00:31:01,432
Yeah, I know, I...
I can only imagine.
I thought

00:31:01,432 --> 00:31:03,968
when my body healed, life
would return to normal,

00:31:03,968 --> 00:31:06,537
only there <i>was</i> no normal.

00:31:06,537 --> 00:31:08,873
You know, I know recovery
can be hard, and I know

00:31:08,873 --> 00:31:11,809
this isn't easy,
and I don't mean to make
you feel uncomfortable,

00:31:11,809 --> 00:31:14,445
but there's just
some details of the case

00:31:14,445 --> 00:31:16,847
that I want to go over
with you, okay?

00:31:16,847 --> 00:31:18,582
I'm just, I'm not really sure

00:31:18,582 --> 00:31:20,618
there's anything new
that I can tell you.

00:31:20,618 --> 00:31:23,321
So, prior to the attack, uh,

00:31:23,321 --> 00:31:25,790
what was your relationship
with David Jorgensen?

00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:28,559
Well, his wife and I
were best friends.

00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,661
JORGENSEN:
<i>Our families were very close.</i>

00:31:30,661 --> 00:31:32,530
Kids played soccer together.

00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:34,865
I'm not sure what
they're into now.

00:31:34,865 --> 00:31:37,468
I haven't seen them

00:31:37,468 --> 00:31:39,704
On the day of the attack,

00:31:39,704 --> 00:31:41,706
you and April had lunch.

00:31:41,706 --> 00:31:43,741
Can you tell me what
you two talked about?

00:31:43,741 --> 00:31:45,910
Connie and I were going
through a rough patch.

00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:49,814
She told April everything;
I wanted some answers.

00:31:49,814 --> 00:31:51,482
And why would
witnesses have said

00:31:51,482 --> 00:31:53,818
that they heard
you arguing?
<i>I told him</i>

00:31:53,818 --> 00:31:56,020
he was a crappy husband;
he didn't want to hear it.

00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,822
And he got angry?
<i>I wasn't...</i>

00:31:57,822 --> 00:32:02,927
angry with April, I was...
frustrated with the situation.

00:32:02,927 --> 00:32:06,464
Were you two
romantically involved?

00:32:06,464 --> 00:32:08,632
Absolutely not.

00:32:08,632 --> 00:32:10,768
I loved my wife.

00:32:10,768 --> 00:32:13,604
April was brutally beaten
with a piece of wood,

00:32:13,604 --> 00:32:15,039
and when you
were arrested

00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:16,974
they did find splinters
in your hands.

00:32:16,974 --> 00:32:18,642
I was stacking firewood.

00:32:18,642 --> 00:32:20,745
The kids liked to use
the fire pit.

00:32:20,745 --> 00:32:22,780
And on the night
of the attack,

00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:25,750
neighbors saw that
you were burning what
appeared to be clothing.

00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:29,820
Can you explain that?
Yeah, I picked the wrong night
to clean out the garage.

00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:33,524
I burned some old rags
and a drop cloth.

00:32:33,524 --> 00:32:36,527
Hey, I know how it sounds...

00:32:36,527 --> 00:32:38,662
but it's the only story I got.

00:32:38,662 --> 00:32:40,731
<i>He just... kept...</i>

00:32:40,731 --> 00:32:41,932
hitting me.

00:32:41,932 --> 00:32:45,369
And I thought
I was gonna die,

00:32:45,369 --> 00:32:47,705
and all I could think
about was my husband

00:32:47,705 --> 00:32:49,473
and my son.

00:32:49,473 --> 00:32:51,742
Are you sure
it was David Jorgensen?

00:32:51,742 --> 00:32:54,678
I remember it clearly.

00:32:54,678 --> 00:32:56,781
I saw his face.

00:32:57,915 --> 00:32:59,950
It was David.

00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:02,653
Why would she say that
if it was not true?

00:33:02,653 --> 00:33:04,555
I don't know.

00:33:04,555 --> 00:33:06,857
I have been asking myself
that question

00:33:06,857 --> 00:33:09,560
for eight years.

00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:12,563
Is there anything that
you're not telling me?

00:33:12,563 --> 00:33:15,833
Something, maybe, that you're
holding back because...

00:33:15,833 --> 00:33:18,335
I've already told you
everything.

00:33:19,703 --> 00:33:22,706
But hell, my own wife
didn't believe me.

00:33:22,706 --> 00:33:25,676
Why should you?

00:33:25,676 --> 00:33:28,846
I never said that I
didn't believe you.

00:33:31,615 --> 00:33:33,451
Hey, Pavarotti.

00:33:33,451 --> 00:33:35,352
I hear you got some
results for me.

00:33:35,352 --> 00:33:37,421
<i>Si,</i> as you suspected,

00:33:37,421 --> 00:33:40,925
I did find trace amounts of
octyl-cyanoacrylate, Invi-Skin,

00:33:40,925 --> 00:33:43,427
on the log used
to beat April Reynolds.

00:33:43,427 --> 00:33:45,329
Just like on the cinder block
from the alley.

00:33:45,329 --> 00:33:46,797
Now, here's where
it gets interesting.

00:33:46,797 --> 00:33:49,533
Please direct your attention
to the monitor.

00:33:49,533 --> 00:33:52,503
This is a wood
fragment extracted

00:33:52,503 --> 00:33:54,104
from April Reynolds'
head wound.

00:33:54,104 --> 00:33:56,407
The white substance
is Invi-Skin.
RUSSELL: Okay.

00:33:56,407 --> 00:33:58,342
I'm gonna show you
a wood fragment

00:33:58,342 --> 00:34:01,078
that was extracted
from David Jorgensen's hand.

00:34:01,078 --> 00:34:03,380
No Invi-Skin.

00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:05,749
So, either these splinters were
taken from a section of the log

00:34:05,749 --> 00:34:07,852
that contained
no Invi-Skin transfer...

00:34:07,852 --> 00:34:10,788
Or Jorgensen
never handled it.

00:34:10,788 --> 00:34:14,525
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

00:34:14,525 --> 00:34:18,062
So, a tiny speck of Invi-Skin
on a tiny speck of wood

00:34:18,062 --> 00:34:19,763
that wasn't tested
for eight years?

00:34:19,763 --> 00:34:20,965
The defense will have

00:34:20,965 --> 00:34:23,100
a field day with this.
A lot of cases

00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:26,003
have been won based
on a tiny speck of evidence.

00:34:26,003 --> 00:34:27,838
Now, we've placed Bowden
near Tresser park

00:34:27,838 --> 00:34:29,840
around the time that
April Reynolds was attacked.

00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,408
From the moment she woke up,

00:34:31,408 --> 00:34:33,043
she's pointed the finger
at David Jorgensen.

00:34:33,043 --> 00:34:34,812
She's never wavered,
and she never will.

00:34:34,812 --> 00:34:36,680
You couldn't have
a more sympathetic witness.

00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:37,982
And what if
the physical evidence

00:34:37,982 --> 00:34:39,750
contradicts her testimony?

00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:42,720
It'll have to be a lot better
than what you have here.

00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,955
I need rock-solid proof
that Bowden was involved.

00:34:44,955 --> 00:34:46,557
So, that's it; he walks.

00:34:48,692 --> 00:34:51,362
First thing in the morning,
I file a motion to dismiss.

00:34:58,002 --> 00:34:59,637
Is it possible April
Reynolds is lying

00:34:59,637 --> 00:35:00,871
about Jorgensen
attacking her?

00:35:00,871 --> 00:35:02,072
I don't know
why she would.

00:35:02,072 --> 00:35:04,008
Unless she had something
against the guy.

00:35:04,008 --> 00:35:05,643
It would have to
be pretty major.

00:35:05,643 --> 00:35:08,078
All right, wait,
let-let's think this out.

00:35:08,078 --> 00:35:12,816
So, the physical evidence seems
to back up Jorgensen's story,

00:35:12,816 --> 00:35:14,518
right?
Right.

00:35:14,518 --> 00:35:16,420
Is it possible they're both
telling the truth?

00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:18,789
Then she'd have to be mistaken.

00:35:18,789 --> 00:35:20,758
Yeah, yeah, in a big way.

00:35:20,758 --> 00:35:22,726
You know, according to
April's medical records,

00:35:22,726 --> 00:35:24,795
she suffered six
fractures to the skull.

00:35:24,795 --> 00:35:26,530
Could that sort of thing
cause delusions,

00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:28,465
altered perceptions of reality?

00:35:28,465 --> 00:35:31,101
Now, that's a good question.

00:35:31,101 --> 00:35:34,338
And I know just the person
to answer it.

00:35:34,338 --> 00:35:36,707
ROBBINS: There may be a
physiological explanation.

00:35:36,707 --> 00:35:38,409
Brain damage?

00:35:38,409 --> 00:35:40,544
Well, in her case, to the
occipital lobe right here.

00:35:40,544 --> 00:35:44,348
As Ms. Reynolds suffered
repeated blows to the head,

00:35:44,348 --> 00:35:45,683
<i>her brain sustained trauma,</i>

00:35:45,683 --> 00:35:48,919
<i>swelling, subdural hematoma.</i>

00:35:48,919 --> 00:35:51,889
At some point during the
attack, she may have seen

00:35:51,889 --> 00:35:53,657
the outline
of her assailant's face.

00:35:55,025 --> 00:35:57,328
<i>In her brain's</i>
<i>traumatized state,</i>

00:35:57,328 --> 00:36:00,097
<i>signals in the visual cortex</i>
<i>misfired, possibly causing her</i>

00:36:00,097 --> 00:36:02,366
<i>to misinterpret</i>
<i>who she was actually seeing.</i>

00:36:02,366 --> 00:36:03,634
RUSSELL:
<i>Okay.</i>

00:36:03,634 --> 00:36:05,369
Why Jorgensen?

00:36:05,369 --> 00:36:06,937
Well, he and April

00:36:06,937 --> 00:36:09,540
did have a heated argument
just a couple hours before.

00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:11,508
That's interesting.

00:36:11,508 --> 00:36:13,978
I replay arguments
in my head all the time.

00:36:13,978 --> 00:36:15,579
We all do, right?

00:36:15,579 --> 00:36:17,014
Maybe she was still thinking
about him

00:36:17,014 --> 00:36:18,549
when she was attacked.

00:36:18,549 --> 00:36:20,084
You're interfering
with my marriage!

00:36:20,084 --> 00:36:21,785
RUSSELL:
<i>Which is why</i>

00:36:21,785 --> 00:36:24,021
<i>she assigned</i>
<i>David Jorgensen's features</i>

00:36:24,021 --> 00:36:26,657
<i>to a faceless stranger.</i>

00:36:26,657 --> 00:36:29,026
ROBBINS: And as the brain tried
to make sense of the trauma,

00:36:29,026 --> 00:36:30,894
it filled in some details.

00:36:30,894 --> 00:36:33,464
Making her believe that
Jorgensen was her assailant.

00:36:33,464 --> 00:36:35,799
Which may or may not be
what actually happened.

00:36:35,799 --> 00:36:37,101
BRODY:
Right.

00:36:37,101 --> 00:36:38,702
Thanks, Doc.

00:36:38,702 --> 00:36:39,970
SANDERS:
Hey, Maggie.

00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:41,739
FOWLER:
Yeah, Maggie loved
Tresser park.

00:36:41,739 --> 00:36:43,641
We used to go there every day.
How did you

00:36:43,641 --> 00:36:45,376
come across
April Reynolds?

00:36:45,376 --> 00:36:47,645
Well, we were just at the
beginning of our walk,

00:36:47,645 --> 00:36:49,313
and Maggie was acting
all weird,

00:36:49,313 --> 00:36:50,981
like she knew something
was wrong,

00:36:50,981 --> 00:36:52,916
and then she yanked
the leash out of my hand,

00:36:52,916 --> 00:36:54,418
and she ran
into the bushes and...

00:36:54,418 --> 00:36:56,020
That's when I saw her.

00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:58,422
Ms. Fowler,

00:36:58,422 --> 00:36:59,990
do you remember
seeing this man

00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:01,659
at the park?

00:37:01,659 --> 00:37:04,561
No, I was too focused on my dog
and that poor girl.

00:37:04,561 --> 00:37:06,563
You know,
all that blood.

00:37:06,563 --> 00:37:08,032
And her face, I just...

00:37:08,032 --> 00:37:10,034
I couldn't believe
she was still alive.

00:37:10,034 --> 00:37:12,036
Yeah, it must have been
horrible for you.

00:37:12,036 --> 00:37:13,737
By the time I got home,
I was so upset.

00:37:13,737 --> 00:37:15,539
You know,
and then that night,

00:37:15,539 --> 00:37:18,008
Maggie was sick, and so I had to
bring her to the emergency vet.

00:37:18,008 --> 00:37:19,610
Really? What happened?

00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:20,878
Oh, she swallowed something.

00:37:20,878 --> 00:37:22,079
(chuckles)

00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:23,747
Something shiny; she ate it.

00:37:23,747 --> 00:37:25,315
She still does.

00:37:25,315 --> 00:37:27,718
Look at this.

00:37:27,718 --> 00:37:28,919
Okay, my mother's brooch,

00:37:28,919 --> 00:37:30,621
a roll of quarters,

00:37:30,621 --> 00:37:31,989
(sighs)
a bell off a Christmas tree.

00:37:31,989 --> 00:37:35,092
Surgery to remove that
cost me 1,000 bucks.

00:37:35,092 --> 00:37:37,661
And, oh, this.

00:37:37,661 --> 00:37:38,996
This is what she swallowed
that day.

00:37:38,996 --> 00:37:40,397
A set of keys.

00:37:42,099 --> 00:37:45,469
You know if Maggie picked
these up at the park?

00:37:45,469 --> 00:37:47,805
Oh, I have no idea; I ran
a million errands that day.

00:37:47,805 --> 00:37:49,106
But you can have them
if it'll help.

00:37:49,106 --> 00:37:50,474
You still have them?

00:37:50,474 --> 00:37:51,742
Oh, yeah.

00:37:51,742 --> 00:37:53,577
No, I keep everything
that Maggie swallows.

00:37:53,577 --> 00:37:55,813
I put it in a display case;
it's quite a conversation piece.

00:38:22,673 --> 00:38:23,841
(shutter clicking)

00:38:23,841 --> 00:38:25,642
SANDERS:
I found that blood spatter

00:38:25,642 --> 00:38:27,511
on the keychain
the dog swallowed.

00:38:27,511 --> 00:38:29,413
Blood's a match
to April Reynolds.
That means

00:38:29,413 --> 00:38:31,782
the keychain was definitely
at the scene of the crime.

00:38:31,782 --> 00:38:34,618
We need to arrest this dog
for obstruction.

00:38:34,618 --> 00:38:35,919
Unfortunately,

00:38:35,919 --> 00:38:37,387
there was no other DNA on them.

00:38:37,387 --> 00:38:38,856
Well, it's a good find,

00:38:38,856 --> 00:38:41,558
but unless we prove that
that key belonged to Bowden,

00:38:41,558 --> 00:38:44,628
it's not gonna
help us much.

00:38:45,662 --> 00:38:47,431
I've got an idea.

00:38:51,435 --> 00:38:54,004
All right,
here's Bowden's car.

00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,375
(grunts)

00:38:59,977 --> 00:39:01,545
Here goes nothing.

00:39:05,783 --> 00:39:07,017
(engine starts)

00:39:09,019 --> 00:39:11,588
If the key fits,
you must convict.

00:39:11,588 --> 00:39:13,323
I think Bowden was interrupted
by the dog.

00:39:13,323 --> 00:39:14,525
In his hurry
to get out of there,

00:39:14,525 --> 00:39:15,726
he must have dropped his keys.

00:39:15,726 --> 00:39:17,361
Dog saved April's life,

00:39:17,361 --> 00:39:19,029
otherwise Bowden would have
finished the job.

00:39:19,029 --> 00:39:20,564
Yeah, I just hope
we're not too late.

00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:50,561
♪ ♪

00:40:04,308 --> 00:40:07,344
(sirens approaching)

00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:21,091
Carl Bowden,

00:40:21,091 --> 00:40:22,559
you're under arrest

00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:23,861
for the attempted murder

00:40:23,861 --> 00:40:25,462
of April Reynolds.

00:40:25,462 --> 00:40:26,864
Detective Moreno,

00:40:26,864 --> 00:40:28,866
make it official.

00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,735
You have the right
to remain silent.

00:40:31,735 --> 00:40:33,904
Anything you say can and will

00:40:33,904 --> 00:40:35,739
be used against you
in a court of law.

00:40:35,739 --> 00:40:38,642
You have the right
to an attorney.

00:40:38,642 --> 00:40:41,745
If you can't afford one,
one will be provided for you.

00:40:45,082 --> 00:40:46,550
You think he enjoyed
his freedom?

00:40:49,586 --> 00:40:50,988
(groans)
Strike!

00:40:50,988 --> 00:40:52,689
It's all right.
You got to swing to hit it.

00:40:52,689 --> 00:40:53,991
It's all right.
Good cut.

00:40:53,991 --> 00:40:55,392
Good cut right there.
Home run, Henry!

00:40:55,392 --> 00:40:56,593
You can do it! Come on.

00:40:56,593 --> 00:40:57,794
Come on, Henry!
Big hit!

00:40:57,794 --> 00:40:58,996
You worked awfully hard

00:40:58,996 --> 00:41:00,631
to get me back here
to third base.

00:41:00,631 --> 00:41:01,999
Yeah, well, we don't
like to win by forfeit.

00:41:01,999 --> 00:41:03,533
Especially to the lab.
Well, that's good,

00:41:03,533 --> 00:41:05,502
because now you can lose
fair and square.

00:41:05,502 --> 00:41:07,037
Oh, really.

00:41:09,706 --> 00:41:10,874
Oh!

00:41:10,874 --> 00:41:12,075
Strike!

00:41:12,075 --> 00:41:14,511
Come on!
That's okay, Henry.

00:41:14,511 --> 00:41:15,946
Time out!

00:41:18,081 --> 00:41:19,616
Time out.

00:41:21,818 --> 00:41:25,589
(whispering indistinctly)

00:41:29,893 --> 00:41:32,863
What the hell
was that about?

00:41:32,863 --> 00:41:34,064
BRODY:
Come on, Henry, come on!

00:41:34,064 --> 00:41:35,465
Go, Henry!

00:41:35,465 --> 00:41:36,867
Do it for science!

00:41:36,867 --> 00:41:38,068
STOKES: Here we go now,
baby; let's go.

00:41:38,068 --> 00:41:39,703
Wait on yours,
wait on yours.

00:41:39,703 --> 00:41:41,972
That's good.

00:41:41,972 --> 00:41:44,541
♪ ♪

00:41:53,984 --> 00:41:55,852

00:41:55,852 --> 00:41:58,355
(shouting, cheering)

00:42:01,425 --> 00:42:03,994
Come on! Slide!

00:42:03,994 --> 00:42:05,595
Safe!

00:42:12,869 --> 00:42:14,071
Henry!

00:42:14,071 --> 00:42:15,472
Yeah!

00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,009
STOKES:
Yeah!

00:42:20,444 --> 00:42:21,678
Well, look at you.

00:42:21,678 --> 00:42:23,480
You've still got it.
Ow.

00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,815
Yeah, you little devil.

00:42:24,815 --> 00:42:26,783
You-you faked that whole
injury thing for Henry.

00:42:26,783 --> 00:42:28,452
It had nothing to do
with Moreno, did it?

00:42:28,452 --> 00:42:29,820
Yeah, I wanted Henry
to hit me in.

00:42:32,723 --> 00:42:34,725
What did you say
to him anyway?
I told him

00:42:34,725 --> 00:42:36,360
there was a really
hot girl watching,

00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,462
and if he got a hit,
maybe she'd go home with him.

00:42:38,462 --> 00:42:39,963
It worked, didn't it?

00:42:42,766 --> 00:42:44,534
Hey, good game.

00:42:44,534 --> 00:42:45,769
Sorry you had to lose.

00:42:45,769 --> 00:42:48,105
I'll live.
Yeah?

00:42:48,105 --> 00:42:49,706
Let's get out of here.
