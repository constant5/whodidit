pizza, lots and lots of booze.

top hat and monocle,

around here, but judging by

that there was one
ugly incident earlier.

00:05:06,552 --> 00:05:08,554

Kevin called him "Dad."

Jimmy, let's go.
We have work to do.

00:05:55,868 --> 00:05:57,570
He inhaled fumes at the scene.

00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,605
Mm.

00:05:59,605 --> 00:06:02,074
Okay, so what's this guy's deal?

00:06:02,074 --> 00:06:03,676
Officer drove up on
a fire blazing,

00:06:03,676 --> 00:06:06,045
open end of an alley,
found him.

00:06:06,045 --> 00:06:07,613
Burning tire
around the body

00:06:07,613 --> 00:06:09,582
probably slipped down
from his throat.

00:06:09,582 --> 00:06:10,816
Necklacing--

00:06:10,816 --> 00:06:12,685
South African thugs

00:06:12,685 --> 00:06:14,920
and cartels south
of the border both do this.

00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,822
It's sad the things that
the world can agree on.

00:06:16,822 --> 00:06:18,591
Not good seeing this in Vegas.

00:06:18,591 --> 00:06:20,759
Same principle as being
burned at the stake.

00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:23,596

Ah, let me guess--
no witnesses.

00:06:34,974 --> 00:06:37,443
Didn't hear the screaming,
didn't even smell the bonfire.

00:06:38,744 --> 00:06:40,012
These tires are
two different treads.

00:06:40,012 --> 00:06:41,714
They're probably
from a junkyard.

00:06:41,714 --> 00:06:42,848
They're not gonna
give us anything.

00:06:42,848 --> 00:06:44,617
SIDE:
Hope of any trace

00:06:44,617 --> 00:06:47,019
or prints from the outside
of the tires is up in smoke.

00:06:47,019 --> 00:06:48,487
Well...

00:06:48,487 --> 00:06:50,789
let's try to get
an I.D. on this guy.

00:06:50,789 --> 00:06:52,057
I say...

00:06:52,057 --> 00:06:54,059
we strip the Michelin
from the man.

00:06:56,495 --> 00:06:58,797
Well, one C.O.D.--

00:06:58,797 --> 00:07:01,367
Cause Of De-pantsing,--
is still a mystery.

00:07:01,367 --> 00:07:03,068
No evidence of
sexual activity.

00:07:03,068 --> 00:07:04,370
Mm.

00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:05,604
So the pants
around his ankles

00:07:05,604 --> 00:07:07,039
was more message
than make-out.

00:07:08,107 --> 00:07:09,808
And the other C.O.D.?

00:07:09,808 --> 00:07:12,411
Asphyxiation via fatal vanity.

00:07:12,411 --> 00:07:16,115
His two front porcelain veneers
were broken and inhaled.

00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,618

00:07:19,618 --> 00:07:22,354
ROBBINS: <i>Lacerated the bronchi,</i>
<i>caused a bronchial spasm.</i>

00:07:22,354 --> 00:07:25,391
Teeth weren't
the only body-mods.

00:07:25,391 --> 00:07:27,793
Pec implants,
hair plugs.

00:07:27,793 --> 00:07:30,129
Geek makes money,
remakes himself.

00:07:30,129 --> 00:07:32,398
You take your new
pride and joy for a spin,

00:07:32,398 --> 00:07:34,099
inevitably somebody
dings it up.

00:07:37,469 --> 00:07:41,106
Weapon was a round implement,
roughly spherical.

00:07:41,106 --> 00:07:43,509
Didn't find anything
like that at the scene.

00:07:43,509 --> 00:07:46,045
Booze flowing, games blasting,
plenty of opportunity

00:07:46,045 --> 00:07:48,113
for the killer to sneak
out with a weapon.

00:07:48,113 --> 00:07:49,915
You throw a good enough party,
people think they can

00:07:49,915 --> 00:07:51,784
get away with anything.

00:07:51,784 --> 00:07:53,819
MAN (on voicemail): <i>Who do you</i>
<i>think you are, Kevin?</i>

00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:56,789
Think tossing me from your party
makes you a man?

00:07:56,789 --> 00:07:59,558
You're a weak
and scared little boy!

00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,996
Not exactly a Hallmark greeting.

00:08:05,731 --> 00:08:08,434
But then you're not exactly
a father, are you, Rick?

00:08:08,434 --> 00:08:10,436
Abandoned him
when he was ten,

00:08:10,436 --> 00:08:12,571
didn't pay a dime
in child support,

00:08:12,571 --> 00:08:15,074
son of a deadbeat,
beat dead.

00:08:15,074 --> 00:08:16,809
You think I had something
to do with that?

00:08:16,809 --> 00:08:18,577
Well, I think that's
a lot of rage to show

00:08:18,577 --> 00:08:20,012
a half an hour
before he was killed.

00:08:20,012 --> 00:08:22,348
And I think a trucker
with a repo'd rig

00:08:22,348 --> 00:08:23,816
has got nothing to haul

00:08:23,816 --> 00:08:26,452
but a greedy grudge
against his millionaire son.

00:08:26,452 --> 00:08:28,587
You crash the party,
you hit him up,

00:08:28,587 --> 00:08:31,390
he shoots you down,
so you really hit him up.

00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:33,726
And then you leave
him a reminder--

00:08:33,726 --> 00:08:35,961
don't get too big
for your britches.

00:08:44,603 --> 00:08:48,007
There was something wrong with
him, even when he was little.

00:08:48,007 --> 00:08:50,042
Sick and twisted
little something.

00:08:50,042 --> 00:08:51,610
The way he'd look at people.

00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:53,746
As he got older,

00:08:53,746 --> 00:08:54,980
made you not want
to be around him.

00:08:56,782 --> 00:08:58,984
So I'm not surprised someone
would see fit to...

00:08:58,984 --> 00:09:01,086
beat the hell out of him.

00:09:01,086 --> 00:09:02,721
Just wasn't me.

00:09:02,721 --> 00:09:06,992
Well, you got an alibi or
just your sunshiny attitude?

00:09:06,992 --> 00:09:09,895
Soon as he made clear
I wasn't getting paid,

00:09:09,895 --> 00:09:12,631
I left that party.

00:09:12,631 --> 00:09:15,000
Check the cameras at that
casino next to the club.

00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,370
I had better luck
yanking those levers.

00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:21,740
Spun a jackpot, won enough
to get my truck back.

00:09:23,442 --> 00:09:24,643
(sighs)

00:09:24,643 --> 00:09:27,079
Happy birthday to me.

00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:34,920
Unless your birthday vic
was part beaver...

00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,089
the weapon was wooden.

00:09:37,089 --> 00:09:40,893
WILLOWS: Trace from his teeth
is varnished oak.

00:09:40,893 --> 00:09:42,561
Baseball bat?

00:09:42,561 --> 00:09:43,862
Hmm, well...

00:09:43,862 --> 00:09:46,065
the wounds are spherical,
not cylindrical.

00:09:46,065 --> 00:09:47,933
Rough extrapolation

00:09:47,933 --> 00:09:51,537
of the curvature, we're looking
at something with a diameter

00:09:51,537 --> 00:09:53,005
of four to five inches?

00:09:55,074 --> 00:09:56,041
Wooden ball.

00:09:57,409 --> 00:09:58,811
Arcade tycoon, right?

00:09:58,811 --> 00:10:01,146
Yeah.
Ah...

00:10:03,382 --> 00:10:04,783
Arcade Bowl Ball.

00:10:04,783 --> 00:10:06,118
Excuse me?

00:10:06,118 --> 00:10:08,520
From the classic game
of luck and skill

00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,056
beloved by children
of all ages-- my guess,

00:10:11,056 --> 00:10:13,792
that's what bashed your vic's
face into a bloody pulp.

00:10:13,792 --> 00:10:17,062
WILLOWS: Arcade Bowl is not
one of the games at the club,

00:10:17,062 --> 00:10:18,764
so the killer would have
had to bring the ball in.

00:10:18,764 --> 00:10:20,933
Making the weapon of choice
significant, no?

00:10:20,933 --> 00:10:23,135
Disgruntled arcade employee.

00:10:23,135 --> 00:10:24,670
That's a good place to start.

00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,839
RUSSELL:
Hey, how did swab-a-palooza go?

00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:28,974
Uh, 200 party guests,
all swabbed, printed

00:10:28,974 --> 00:10:30,876
and checked for spatter,
all clean.

00:10:30,876 --> 00:10:33,445
Well, maybe you'll have more
luck at your next case.

00:10:33,445 --> 00:10:34,713
I want you to
restock your kit,

00:10:34,713 --> 00:10:37,015
and go meet Morgan
at the Park Motel.

00:10:39,017 --> 00:10:42,788
It's a scene, not a date,
you wacky kid, you.

00:10:44,556 --> 00:10:47,860
Hey, I heard you're looking
for unhappy arcade clerks

00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,528
who might have played
Whack-A-Boss.

00:10:49,528 --> 00:10:51,430
I didn't find any.

00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:53,632
And Fetzer's franchises
don't carry Arcade Bowl.

00:10:53,632 --> 00:10:55,767
But the weapon is so unusual

00:10:55,767 --> 00:10:57,636
that I searched online
for any connection

00:10:57,636 --> 00:10:58,937
between Kevin Fetzer
and the game.

00:10:58,937 --> 00:10:59,905
Check this out.

00:11:02,374 --> 00:11:04,576
In 1991,

00:11:04,576 --> 00:11:06,011
an eight-year-old boy

00:11:06,011 --> 00:11:07,679
named Mikey Moran
was celebrating his birthday

00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:09,047
at an arcade.

00:11:09,047 --> 00:11:10,516
He goes missing.

00:11:10,516 --> 00:11:12,017
His body is found
behind the place.

00:11:12,017 --> 00:11:13,886
His pants are off;
he's been beaten to death.

00:11:13,886 --> 00:11:17,823
The weapon, a bloody arcade
ball, is lying next to him.

00:11:17,823 --> 00:11:19,525
Unbelievable.

00:11:19,525 --> 00:11:22,728
RUSSELL: "Arcade worker
Kevin Fetzer, age 15,

00:11:22,728 --> 00:11:24,363
"said it was a day

00:11:24,363 --> 00:11:26,565
that nobody in the arcade
would ever forget."

00:11:26,565 --> 00:11:28,500
And guess what acne-faced
future millionaire

00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,002
was questioned
as a person of interest?

00:11:30,002 --> 00:11:31,737
Kevin Fetzer.

00:11:31,737 --> 00:11:34,640
Yeah.
I pulled the case file.

00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,742
There was never an arrest
made for the boy's murder.

00:11:36,742 --> 00:11:41,413
Somebody turned Kevin's birthday
into his judgment day.

00:11:46,652 --> 00:11:48,520
(woman screaming)

00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,456
BRODY: <i>Motel guest heard a</i>
<i>disturbance, phoned it in,</i>

00:11:51,456 --> 00:11:53,525
officers responded
and found her.

00:11:53,525 --> 00:11:55,427
Her name's Darlene Crocker.

00:11:55,427 --> 00:11:57,429
Motel manager said she's been
staying here a few weeks.

00:11:57,429 --> 00:11:59,498
Alone?
Not really.
She's been known to have

00:11:59,498 --> 00:12:01,800
various male guests
for an hour at a time.

00:12:02,901 --> 00:12:04,069
But witnesses said

00:12:04,069 --> 00:12:06,138
nobody left during
or after the attack.

00:12:06,138 --> 00:12:07,539
Snuck out a window...?

00:12:07,539 --> 00:12:10,142
Huh-- no getting
through those bars.

00:12:10,142 --> 00:12:11,643
Bathroom windows
would be tight,

00:12:11,643 --> 00:12:13,612
even for a lightweight,

00:12:13,612 --> 00:12:15,781
and this damage
is Ali-Foreman.

00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,921
Some sort of crystals--

00:12:22,921 --> 00:12:24,690
Cocaine?

00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:26,358
Maybe meth?

00:12:28,594 --> 00:12:30,362
Yellow powder
near her mouth.

00:12:30,362 --> 00:12:34,967
I don't think
it's drug trace.

00:12:34,967 --> 00:12:40,739
So... she's using with
some lucky man of the hour.

00:12:40,739 --> 00:12:43,075
Somehow, session
goes sideways.

00:12:43,075 --> 00:12:44,476
And what, he just
kills her

00:12:44,476 --> 00:12:47,446
and leaves without
anybody noticing?

00:12:47,446 --> 00:12:51,950
These punctures have
irregular jagged edges.

00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:53,986
That's inconsistent with
a single, sharp blade.

00:12:56,488 --> 00:12:57,656
Messy stabbing...

00:12:57,656 --> 00:13:01,393
messy scene...

00:13:01,393 --> 00:13:02,794
clean getaway.

00:13:02,794 --> 00:13:04,997
Like the killer just vanished.

00:13:08,066 --> 00:13:10,369
Bloody Mary.

00:13:10,369 --> 00:13:12,671
Well, yeah, there's an empty
bottle of vodka on the bed.

00:13:12,671 --> 00:13:14,072
No, not the drink,

00:13:14,072 --> 00:13:15,407
the ghost.

00:13:16,808 --> 00:13:20,112
See, you stand in front
of a mirror, lights out,

00:13:20,112 --> 00:13:24,516
you say her name
three times...

00:13:24,516 --> 00:13:26,952
and then she bursts through
the glass and kills you.

00:13:26,952 --> 00:13:29,454
Are we at a crime scene or

00:13:29,454 --> 00:13:30,656
a seventh-grade sleepover?

00:13:40,565 --> 00:13:41,667
(sighs)

00:13:41,667 --> 00:13:43,935
Just a theory.

00:13:46,438 --> 00:13:51,810
Someone beat Kevin Fetzer's
face in with an arcade ball.

00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:53,078
There's some justice in that.

00:13:53,078 --> 00:13:55,147
I've got the case file

00:13:55,147 --> 00:13:56,815
from the original
arcade ball murder--

00:13:56,815 --> 00:13:58,917
Mikey Moran-- just
to jog your memory.

00:13:58,917 --> 00:14:01,586
Yeah, that was one of the
first murders I ever worked.

00:14:01,586 --> 00:14:05,824
A scene like that, your memory
gets plenty of miles on its own.

00:14:08,593 --> 00:14:10,462
<i>We found the body</i>
<i>behind the arcade.</i>

00:14:10,462 --> 00:14:11,596
<i>The weapon was right there.</i>

00:14:13,065 --> 00:14:15,067
<i>And for my money,</i>
<i>so was the killer.</i>

00:14:16,968 --> 00:14:18,870
That Fetzer kid
struck me strange

00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,138
the instant I saw him.

00:14:20,138 --> 00:14:22,474
He's hanging around
the scene, and then

00:14:22,474 --> 00:14:23,775
he leaves for an hour,

00:14:23,775 --> 00:14:25,744
and comes back carrying
two little shoes.

00:14:25,744 --> 00:14:27,746
Ugh. Mikey's?

00:14:27,746 --> 00:14:29,781
He said that he found them
ditched a half block away.

00:14:29,781 --> 00:14:31,850
He just happened
to be looking over there.

00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:33,552
But there was no
physical evidence found

00:14:33,552 --> 00:14:35,587
that connected
Kevin Fetzer to the crime.

00:14:35,587 --> 00:14:36,922
Well, we did
find a pubic hair

00:14:36,922 --> 00:14:38,623
on the little boy--
blond, like Fetzer--

00:14:38,623 --> 00:14:42,461
but DNA testing was new,
and we didn't get a result.

00:14:42,461 --> 00:14:45,897
And it wasn't re-tested
with improved technology?

00:14:45,897 --> 00:14:48,900
The, uh, sample was consumed
on the first test and...

00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,035
that was my call.

00:14:50,035 --> 00:14:51,937
I was new on the job.

00:14:51,937 --> 00:14:53,805
I went all in,
and I crapped out.

00:14:53,805 --> 00:14:56,375
That was the first time that I
learned that the job isn't fair.

00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:57,709
You know, you could
have the killer standing

00:14:57,709 --> 00:15:01,446
right in front of you,
know that he did it and...

00:15:01,446 --> 00:15:04,082
you know, it feels like the
cuffs are on your own wrists.

00:15:04,082 --> 00:15:06,785
We've all been there, Lou.

00:15:08,553 --> 00:15:11,957
So, do you have any suspects
on Kevin Fetzer's murder?

00:15:11,957 --> 00:15:14,359
No. Brass talked
to Fetzer's dad,

00:15:14,359 --> 00:15:15,660
who had an alibi.

00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,896
We got him on casino
surveillance.

00:15:17,896 --> 00:15:20,565
He should be talking
to Mikey Moran's family.

00:15:20,565 --> 00:15:22,567
After what Fetzer did
to that little boy,

00:15:22,567 --> 00:15:26,605
if that were my kid,
I wouldn't have waited 20 years.

00:15:37,349 --> 00:15:39,418
SIDLE: <i>Considering where</i>
<i>and how we found him,</i>

00:15:39,418 --> 00:15:42,354
<i>we figured our John Doe</i>
<i>was a Snakeback or a La Tijera.</i>

00:15:42,354 --> 00:15:45,424
<i>There was nothing</i>
<i>to help get more specific,</i>

00:15:45,424 --> 00:15:46,825
<i>except his arms pinned</i>
<i>to his sides</i>

00:15:46,825 --> 00:15:49,895
<i>left small portions</i>
<i>of unburnt flesh</i>

00:15:49,895 --> 00:15:51,496
<i>and an old battle wound.</i>

00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:55,734
SIDLE: I've been searching
for similar scars

00:15:55,734 --> 00:15:56,902
in the gang database.

00:15:56,902 --> 00:15:58,937
Our burning man is a La Tijera

00:15:58,937 --> 00:16:00,939
named Ramon Castillo,
street name Espectro.

00:16:00,939 --> 00:16:02,507
Yeah, it means "Ghost."

00:16:02,507 --> 00:16:04,910
VEGA: Big baller with
La Tijeras some years back.

00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:07,379
Made my early days in the
gang task force a real joy.

00:16:07,379 --> 00:16:08,780
Earned you some overtime,

00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,081
did he, Sam?

00:16:10,081 --> 00:16:11,950
Yeah, he and a Snakeback
rival, Diego Barra,

00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:14,052
they were a regular
Itchy and Scratchy.

00:16:14,052 --> 00:16:15,420
Shots traded
back and forth,

00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,688
killing each other's
friends.

00:16:16,688 --> 00:16:18,557
Barra's still on the street?
No.

00:16:18,557 --> 00:16:20,625
Been locked up for
almost a decade now.

00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,461
He could have ordered
the hit from inside, no?

00:16:22,461 --> 00:16:23,862
Let's put him on a bus

00:16:23,862 --> 00:16:26,031
and bring his ass down
here and talk to him.

00:16:26,031 --> 00:16:27,632
How's your Spanish
these days?

00:16:27,632 --> 00:16:28,767
<i>No bueno.</i>

00:16:28,767 --> 00:16:29,968
But you can help me
out there, bud.

00:16:29,968 --> 00:16:31,837
<i>Tu? Nunca.</i>

00:16:31,837 --> 00:16:32,771
<i>Vamos.</i>

00:16:37,108 --> 00:16:38,844
Your motel vic's
organs are pale

00:16:38,844 --> 00:16:41,012
as a result of
exsanguination

00:16:41,012 --> 00:16:43,682
due to severing of the
carotid jugular complex.

00:16:43,682 --> 00:16:45,050
STOKES:
Her throat was slashed.

00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:46,785
Someone did a number on her.

00:16:46,785 --> 00:16:48,353
Hello.

00:16:48,353 --> 00:16:50,355
Maybe Darlene Crocker
looked her killer in the eye

00:16:50,355 --> 00:16:52,958
and didn't like what she saw.

00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:54,960
Weapon was a shard
of broken mirror.

00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,528
Hers were the only
prints on it.

00:16:56,528 --> 00:16:58,697
No one was seen leaving
the motel room,

00:16:58,697 --> 00:17:00,565
so we're thinking
she killed herself.

00:17:00,565 --> 00:17:03,401
(screaming)

00:17:04,669 --> 00:17:06,471
Brutality like this
is unusual.

00:17:07,539 --> 00:17:09,441
Suicide is resignation.

00:17:09,441 --> 00:17:10,809
These wounds are rage.

00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,914
(inhales)

00:17:15,914 --> 00:17:18,083
Did you and Morgan find
any drugs at the scene?

00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:20,552
Uh, just some kind
of crystal trace.

00:17:20,552 --> 00:17:21,586
Smell this.

00:17:23,121 --> 00:17:25,390
Ugh! Room service in Hell
doesn't smell that bad.

00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:26,691
What is it?

00:17:26,691 --> 00:17:28,760
A distinct ether-like odor.

00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,895
Pretty rare these days.

00:17:29,895 --> 00:17:31,096
PCP.

00:17:31,096 --> 00:17:32,631
Oh, bad trip.

00:17:32,631 --> 00:17:34,533
That would explain
the self-mutilation.

00:17:35,901 --> 00:17:37,636
(trembling laughter)

00:17:37,636 --> 00:17:39,538
<i>Hallucinatory state.</i>

00:17:39,538 --> 00:17:42,440
<i>She thinks she's fighting off</i>
<i>untold dark forces.</i>

00:17:44,042 --> 00:17:46,745
(eerie laughter)

00:17:50,749 --> 00:17:52,884
ROBBINS:
<i>Not self-destruction...</i>

00:17:52,884 --> 00:17:55,754
in her mind, self-defense.

00:17:55,754 --> 00:17:57,422
Well, Henry's
running tox right now.

00:17:57,422 --> 00:18:00,759
If it is PCP, we'll
get confirmation.

00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:02,427
Detective Vega.

00:18:02,427 --> 00:18:03,962
I know you.

00:18:03,962 --> 00:18:05,997
You put me in the joint
and never come to visit.

00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,002
I was waiting
for a special occasion,

00:18:11,002 --> 00:18:13,705
like the day they'd
flip the switch.

00:18:13,705 --> 00:18:15,574
(laughs)

00:18:15,574 --> 00:18:19,878
You must be confusing me with
some other innocent <i>vato.</i>

00:18:19,878 --> 00:18:21,813
I'm only doing 25 to life.

00:18:21,813 --> 00:18:23,815
Not if you had anything
to do with killing Espectro.

00:18:26,818 --> 00:18:27,819
Serious?

00:18:27,819 --> 00:18:30,455
Damn right I'm serious.

00:18:30,455 --> 00:18:31,656
Someone ghosted him for real?

00:18:31,656 --> 00:18:33,959
I'm shocked you didn't know.

00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:38,363
You best believe
I wanted to kill him.

00:18:40,699 --> 00:18:42,067
But the punk
vanished underground

00:18:42,067 --> 00:18:44,002
before I had a chance
to stick him there.

00:18:45,804 --> 00:18:49,007
So whoever took him out,
how'd they do it?

00:18:51,076 --> 00:18:52,944
Must have been a lucky shot,

00:18:52,944 --> 00:18:55,680
because there was no getting
close to Espectro.

00:18:57,949 --> 00:18:59,651
That wasn't luck.

00:19:09,694 --> 00:19:11,096
(whispering):
Marta.

00:19:11,096 --> 00:19:12,897
Marta?

00:19:12,897 --> 00:19:14,866
Who-Who's Marta?

00:19:16,768 --> 00:19:19,437
No man did that.

00:19:19,437 --> 00:19:21,806
For a sinner like Espectro,

00:19:21,806 --> 00:19:24,442
there's forces in the universe
more powerful than man.

00:19:45,096 --> 00:19:46,731
STOKES:
Marta Arterro,

00:19:46,731 --> 00:19:49,134
Diego Barra's girlfriend
from back in '02.

00:19:49,134 --> 00:19:52,537
Now, the hood grapevine
says that Espectro

00:19:52,537 --> 00:19:54,472
was the one who set her ablaze.

00:19:54,472 --> 00:19:55,807
And now somebody
kills Espectro

00:19:55,807 --> 00:19:57,876
in the same fiery manner.

00:19:57,876 --> 00:19:59,577
Nine years later?

00:19:59,577 --> 00:20:01,680
That's some serious
felony procrastination.

00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,915
Well, it's 11 years
quicker than it took

00:20:03,915 --> 00:20:07,085
Kevin Fetzer to catch
his retribution.

00:20:07,085 --> 00:20:08,520
RUSSELL:
Okay...

00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,556
Two crimes...

00:20:11,556 --> 00:20:13,525
Both blasts from the past.

00:20:13,525 --> 00:20:16,027
Do we think there's
a connection?

00:20:17,962 --> 00:20:20,365
HODGES: Crime scene photo
doesn't do the trace justice.

00:20:20,365 --> 00:20:21,766
BRODY:
You're right.

00:20:21,766 --> 00:20:23,401
It's lovely.

00:20:23,401 --> 00:20:25,904
What the heck is it?

00:20:25,904 --> 00:20:28,907
The trace you got from your
motel vic's face is pollen.

00:20:28,907 --> 00:20:30,408
From the flame lily.

00:20:30,408 --> 00:20:33,712
The particles, not
unlike one David Hodges,

00:20:33,712 --> 00:20:37,515
exhibit a highly-sculptured
outer shell.

00:20:37,515 --> 00:20:39,551
Helps them cling
to passing bodies

00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:41,386
in desperate hopes
of propagation.

00:20:43,421 --> 00:20:46,858
There were no flowers
in the motel room.

00:20:46,858 --> 00:20:48,893
And we didn't see
anything outside.

00:20:48,893 --> 00:20:51,629
Possible pollen transfer
from the killer.

00:20:51,629 --> 00:20:53,898
Morgan, I got
those results.

00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,135
Thanks for the flowers...

00:20:58,403 --> 00:20:59,637
...but I got a date with Henry.

00:21:05,009 --> 00:21:06,945
Doc Robbins' nose
knows drugs.

00:21:06,945 --> 00:21:08,680
Motel vic's
tox panel showed

00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,382
a lethal level of PCP
in her system.

00:21:11,382 --> 00:21:12,751
Angel dust?!

00:21:12,751 --> 00:21:14,586
Thought that stuff
went out in the early '90s.

00:21:14,586 --> 00:21:15,920
Well, you're right.

00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,622
And the sample she
ingested appears to be

00:21:17,622 --> 00:21:19,791
from a vintage
batch of the drug.

00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:21,726
See, there's a trace
of a component,

00:21:21,726 --> 00:21:24,529
PCC, in her blood--
it was a compound used

00:21:24,529 --> 00:21:27,365
to manufacture PCP
until the early '90s

00:21:27,365 --> 00:21:29,934
when PCC became
heavily controlled.

00:21:29,934 --> 00:21:32,003
Nobody uses that recipe anymore.

00:21:32,003 --> 00:21:35,039
Why would somebody hold on
to an old dose of PCP?

00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:39,477
With age, it acquires delicious
notes of a woodsy vanilla.

00:21:40,645 --> 00:21:43,548
No, it stays the same toxic,

00:21:43,548 --> 00:21:44,983
stinking
nightmare fuel

00:21:44,983 --> 00:21:46,417
it started as.

00:21:46,417 --> 00:21:48,353
Doesn't make
any sense.
Hm.

00:21:48,353 --> 00:21:49,687
Holed up in
that hotel room,

00:21:49,687 --> 00:21:52,090
dosed with a blast
from the past.

00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:54,959
Did you just say
"blast from the past"?

00:21:54,959 --> 00:21:58,530
Our motel room vic,
Darlene Crocker,

00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:01,566
ingested a lethal load
of vintage formula PCP.

00:22:01,566 --> 00:22:04,068
Okay, Henry, check out

00:22:04,068 --> 00:22:06,971
the LIMS database
to see if Darlene
Crocker has any prior

00:22:06,971 --> 00:22:09,707
criminal record or
any connection to old crimes.

00:22:09,707 --> 00:22:11,042
Doesn't have
to be recent.

00:22:13,578 --> 00:22:16,047
Today,
the past is present.

00:22:18,783 --> 00:22:20,685
Whoa.

00:22:23,721 --> 00:22:26,724
Happened again...
again.

00:22:26,724 --> 00:22:28,126
Morgan and Greg's case.

00:22:28,126 --> 00:22:30,094
A Darlene Crocker.

00:22:30,094 --> 00:22:33,865
1989, her 12-and-a-half-
year-old daughter Chelsea

00:22:33,865 --> 00:22:36,601
died a pretty
gruesome death on PCP,

00:22:36,601 --> 00:22:38,970
just like her mother did today.

00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:41,906
(groans) A little girl
with that kind of drug?

00:22:41,906 --> 00:22:43,708
Junkie older brother,
Ken Crocker,

00:22:43,708 --> 00:22:46,444
confessed to having fed it
to her and then got sent away.

00:22:46,444 --> 00:22:49,547
22 years later, Mom
self-destructs on the same drug?
Yeah.

00:22:49,547 --> 00:22:51,649
See, I'm not so sure
that she just happened

00:22:51,649 --> 00:22:53,718
to choose today
to take that dose.

00:22:53,718 --> 00:22:55,987
Somebody forced her
to take it-- murder.

00:22:55,987 --> 00:22:57,989
Just like the burning tires
and the arcade ball.

00:22:57,989 --> 00:23:00,592
Death by deja vu.

00:23:04,996 --> 00:23:07,632
RUSSELL: Tonight, you will
be visited by the spirits

00:23:07,632 --> 00:23:09,901
of three old cases...

00:23:09,901 --> 00:23:13,504
Uh, sorry, I haven't
had much sleep lately.

00:23:13,504 --> 00:23:16,374
The question is,
why these three cases,

00:23:16,374 --> 00:23:17,642
and why now?

00:23:17,642 --> 00:23:18,977
And who's this

00:23:18,977 --> 00:23:22,380
mysterious Jacob Marley
summoning their spirits?

00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,115
There's no obvious
connections,

00:23:24,115 --> 00:23:25,884
and there's years
between the murders.

00:23:25,884 --> 00:23:27,752
It's three different
areas of Vegas,

00:23:27,752 --> 00:23:30,121
tire-fire Marta
in a Northside hood,

00:23:30,121 --> 00:23:32,590
PCP Chelsea
in a trailer park,

00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:34,425
and Birthday Mikey
in the burbs.

00:23:34,425 --> 00:23:35,827
Two child vics, one adult.

00:23:35,827 --> 00:23:36,995
SIDLE:
One big difference.

00:23:36,995 --> 00:23:38,029
Espectro and Fetzer

00:23:38,029 --> 00:23:39,130
both escaped justice,

00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:40,832
at least
the first time around,

00:23:40,832 --> 00:23:42,467
but the Crocker case was solved.

00:23:42,467 --> 00:23:43,801
Brother was convicted.

00:23:43,801 --> 00:23:46,471
So why's Darlene
paying for that now?

00:23:46,471 --> 00:23:49,607
Maybe someone thinks the wrong
person paid for it back then.

00:23:49,607 --> 00:23:51,943
Yeah.

00:23:51,943 --> 00:23:54,078
All right, there's got
to be more to that story.

00:23:54,078 --> 00:23:57,649
Chelsea Crocker-- she
had little plastic flower
barrettes in her hair.

00:23:57,649 --> 00:23:59,550
<i>The strands of it</i>

00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:02,720
<i>she ripped out at the scalp</i>
<i>as the PCP ripped through her,</i>

00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,455
scratched her arms to threads.

00:24:04,455 --> 00:24:07,792
She was 12 years old,
70 pounds.

00:24:07,792 --> 00:24:10,428
Gram of PCP shoved
down her throat.

00:24:10,428 --> 00:24:12,397
Dumped like trash.

00:24:12,397 --> 00:24:14,766
What ab-- what about
the brother?

00:24:14,766 --> 00:24:16,401
Ken Crocker.

00:24:16,401 --> 00:24:17,769
19, user.

00:24:17,769 --> 00:24:19,604
We found him a day
later in an alleyway

00:24:19,604 --> 00:24:20,972
on the nod, right?

00:24:20,972 --> 00:24:22,507
He confessed.

00:24:22,507 --> 00:24:25,443
Said his little sister
was getting on his nerves,

00:24:25,443 --> 00:24:27,111
so he fed her the dust,

00:24:27,111 --> 00:24:29,414
just wanted to see
what would happen.
Wow. All right.

00:24:29,414 --> 00:24:32,383
And where-where was Mom
Darlene during all of this?

00:24:32,383 --> 00:24:33,718
She was at home asleep,
taking a nap.

00:24:33,718 --> 00:24:35,620
<i>Gave off a weird vibe, though.</i>

00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,422
<i>It was something we should've</i>
<i>taken a closer look at.</i>

00:24:37,422 --> 00:24:38,756
Why? What do you mean?

00:24:38,756 --> 00:24:40,091
Well, about two years
into his sentence,

00:24:40,091 --> 00:24:41,693
brother Ken hires a P.I.

00:24:41,693 --> 00:24:43,094
He said he was
so messed up

00:24:43,094 --> 00:24:44,729
on the night
of his sister's death

00:24:44,729 --> 00:24:46,364
that he forgot he had an alibi.

00:24:46,364 --> 00:24:48,499
So, the P.I.
checks it out,

00:24:48,499 --> 00:24:50,969
proves it, gets Ken off.

00:24:50,969 --> 00:24:53,705
But the kid blew his luck
two days later on a motorcycle.

00:24:53,705 --> 00:24:56,674
So, the mom was the
only one at home

00:24:56,674 --> 00:24:58,710
the night that
Chelsea died.

00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:00,611
The cup used to dose her
had the fingerprints

00:25:00,611 --> 00:25:01,980
of both Darlene and Ken on it.

00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,815
So with Ken
out of the picture,

00:25:03,815 --> 00:25:05,950
Darlene was
the last suspect standing.

00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:08,720
But the DA refused
to indict, based upon

00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,722
Ken's wrongful conviction,
because he said it

00:25:10,722 --> 00:25:12,390
"muddied the waters."

00:25:13,925 --> 00:25:15,893
Well, I guess the waters
are a lot cleaner

00:25:15,893 --> 00:25:17,028
now that justice is served.

00:25:21,466 --> 00:25:25,403
Well, you know, whether or not
she was guilty back then,

00:25:25,403 --> 00:25:27,005
Darlene Crocker was murdered.

00:25:27,005 --> 00:25:28,106
And I need...
Whoa, whoa, whoa,

00:25:28,106 --> 00:25:29,507
whoa, whoa.

00:25:32,043 --> 00:25:33,544
The little girl was murdered.

00:25:33,544 --> 00:25:37,081
Darlene got what
was coming to her.

00:25:39,717 --> 00:25:40,785
Hey...

00:25:40,785 --> 00:25:42,020
are we done here?

00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,955
Because I got
a lot of work to do.

00:25:45,857 --> 00:25:48,126
Chromatogram of
the by-products

00:25:48,126 --> 00:25:50,128
and impurities in the PCP sample

00:25:50,128 --> 00:25:52,130
from Darlene Crocker's
motel room this morning,

00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:54,365
and the same analysis of the PCP

00:25:54,365 --> 00:25:56,567
that killed
Chelsea Crocker in '89.

00:25:56,567 --> 00:25:59,070
Mother and daughter
didn't just die on PCP.

00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:01,773
They died on PCP
from the exact same batch.

00:26:01,773 --> 00:26:05,810
Well, no dealer or user would
hold on to the same drug batch

00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:07,745
for 22 years.

00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,982
But I know someplace that does.

00:26:20,892 --> 00:26:22,960
All right, a PCP sample

00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,496
from Chelsea's death
was checked out

00:26:25,496 --> 00:26:28,032
of the police evidence
vault last November.

00:26:28,032 --> 00:26:30,768
By who?

00:26:30,768 --> 00:26:33,404
Detective
Stan Richardson?

00:26:33,404 --> 00:26:35,073
Sample was never returned.

00:26:38,142 --> 00:26:39,877
VARTANN:
Richardson?

00:26:39,877 --> 00:26:41,646
He retired a year back.

00:26:41,646 --> 00:26:42,780
Did you work with him much?

00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:43,915
No, I used to
drink with him.

00:26:43,915 --> 00:26:45,116
A bunch of us did.

00:26:45,116 --> 00:26:47,351
Bar called the Blue Rail.

00:26:47,351 --> 00:26:48,686
Richardson would buy rounds

00:26:48,686 --> 00:26:50,888
and listen to us
bitch about the job.

00:26:50,888 --> 00:26:52,623
If you had a case that
was really bothering you,

00:26:52,623 --> 00:26:54,358
you'd talk to him about it.
He had a way

00:26:54,358 --> 00:26:55,660
of putting things
in perspective.

00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,128
Make you feel better.

00:26:57,128 --> 00:26:59,597
Did you talk to him about
the Mikey Moran case?

00:26:59,597 --> 00:27:00,798
About Kevin Fetzer?

00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:03,000
It was 20 years ago.

00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,535
You know, I might have.

00:27:04,535 --> 00:27:05,870
Talk to him recently?

00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:09,006
Not since I stopped
drinking, so...

00:27:09,006 --> 00:27:12,376
11 years, seven months
and 14 days.
We've been trying

00:27:12,376 --> 00:27:13,744
to reach him,
and his address

00:27:13,744 --> 00:27:15,580
and number on file
are no good.

00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:19,550
Like I said, you know,
it's been years.

00:27:22,086 --> 00:27:23,654
(sighs)

00:27:23,654 --> 00:27:27,125
I mean, last I heard,
there were still a few guys

00:27:27,125 --> 00:27:29,961
who'd tip 'em back
with Richardson.

00:27:29,961 --> 00:27:31,963
Who?

00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,503
Hey, what do you drink, Jim?

00:27:38,503 --> 00:27:40,438
Are you a
scotch man?

00:27:40,438 --> 00:27:43,007
I'm more picky about
the company than the drink.

00:27:43,007 --> 00:27:44,742
Did you forget something?

00:27:44,742 --> 00:27:47,578
I heard that you used to drink
with Stan Richardson.

00:27:47,578 --> 00:27:49,413
Yeah, and...?

00:27:49,413 --> 00:27:51,048
Well, I was just hoping
you could tell me

00:27:51,048 --> 00:27:52,550
anything you could about him?

00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:54,418
He's a good detective.

00:27:54,418 --> 00:27:55,720
Wore the job hard.

00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,388
Hopefully on
a houseboat somewhere.

00:27:59,056 --> 00:28:00,691
Did something happen to him?

00:28:00,691 --> 00:28:03,928
Do you know where
that houseboat might be?

00:28:03,928 --> 00:28:06,063
This about the revenge murders?

00:28:06,063 --> 00:28:07,798
Do you think he's involved?

00:28:07,798 --> 00:28:10,067
We have reason to believe, yeah.

00:28:10,067 --> 00:28:11,869
You're wrong. It's a fantasy.

00:28:11,869 --> 00:28:13,871
Every cop keeps a hit list
of loose cases

00:28:13,871 --> 00:28:15,740
and unfinished business
running around in his head.

00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,041
Nobody ever
acts on it.

00:28:17,041 --> 00:28:19,810
Stan Richardson
checked out drug evidence

00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:21,646
two days before
he retired.

00:28:21,646 --> 00:28:25,383
It was used this morning in
the murder of Darlene Crocker.

00:28:30,988 --> 00:28:34,058
Richardson is not a murderer.

00:28:34,058 --> 00:28:36,360
Well, maybe he calls it justice.

00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,662
You know?

00:28:37,662 --> 00:28:40,531
They get what they
have coming, right?

00:28:43,134 --> 00:28:45,136
(phone rings)

00:28:45,136 --> 00:28:46,904
Excuse me. Yeah?

00:28:46,904 --> 00:28:48,506
STOKES:
Okay, listen up, boss.

00:28:48,506 --> 00:28:50,641
The Pension Office said
Richardson's funds

00:28:50,641 --> 00:28:53,044
are direct deposit
to some bank.

00:28:53,044 --> 00:28:56,447
He said that automatic payments
for rent are to 600 Oak Street.

00:28:56,447 --> 00:28:58,349
Catherine and I are
headed there right now.

00:28:58,349 --> 00:28:59,984
Okay.

00:28:59,984 --> 00:29:01,719
Make sure you bring backup.

00:29:05,089 --> 00:29:06,424
(phone beeps off)

00:29:10,361 --> 00:29:12,063
Mr. Richardson doesn't
get many visitors.

00:29:12,063 --> 00:29:13,798
Exactly how long
has Mr. Richardson

00:29:13,798 --> 00:29:15,066
been residing here?

00:29:15,066 --> 00:29:16,467
Six weeks.

00:29:16,467 --> 00:29:17,935
He'll be missed
when he departs.

00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:21,973
Mr. Richardson,
some friends are
here to see you.

00:29:28,412 --> 00:29:29,880
Detective...

00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,515
Richardson?

00:29:31,515 --> 00:29:33,751
You finally caught up to me.

00:29:43,494 --> 00:29:44,795
RICHARDSON:
<i>What more do you want?</i>

00:29:44,795 --> 00:29:46,530
You've got my confession.

00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:49,533
I made those people pay
for their crimes.

00:29:49,533 --> 00:29:51,402
I'm ready to settle up.

00:29:51,402 --> 00:29:54,405
Well, we've talked to
your hospice nurses, Stan.

00:29:54,405 --> 00:29:56,107
End-stage pancreatic cancer.

00:29:56,107 --> 00:29:58,075
You haven't been out
of bed in a month.

00:29:58,075 --> 00:30:01,812
When something must be done,
the universe

00:30:01,812 --> 00:30:04,482
has a way of granting power.

00:30:04,482 --> 00:30:06,017
Oh, we're in
agreement

00:30:06,017 --> 00:30:07,485
that you had help;
it was just

00:30:07,485 --> 00:30:10,421
more of the human variety.

00:30:10,421 --> 00:30:12,423
(muffled cough)
Well, since

00:30:12,423 --> 00:30:14,892
you're so at peace with the
universe, you wouldn't mind us

00:30:14,892 --> 00:30:17,695
taking a look around your
little corner of it?

00:30:17,695 --> 00:30:20,031
No. Go ahead.

00:30:20,031 --> 00:30:22,133
Thank you.

00:30:22,133 --> 00:30:24,101
If you see

00:30:24,101 --> 00:30:25,970
anything you like...

00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:28,005
I have no need for it anymore.

00:30:40,851 --> 00:30:42,553
(Richardson coughs)

00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:01,706
Nick.

00:31:05,142 --> 00:31:08,145
(whispering):
There was trace of lily pollen

00:31:08,145 --> 00:31:09,447
on Darlene Crocker.

00:31:12,416 --> 00:31:14,485
Soil's been disturbed.

00:31:26,731 --> 00:31:29,533
(muffled coughing)

00:31:30,801 --> 00:31:32,903
Avenging angel's
buried treasure?

00:31:32,903 --> 00:31:35,506
Mm-hmm. Angel's got
to have somebody out there

00:31:35,506 --> 00:31:36,841
doing the killing
for him.

00:31:36,841 --> 00:31:38,376
That same killer

00:31:38,376 --> 00:31:40,111
tracked pollen
into the motel scene,

00:31:40,111 --> 00:31:41,445
and the pollen...

00:31:44,014 --> 00:31:45,883
...led us to this lockbox.

00:31:50,755 --> 00:31:52,390
Sara?

00:31:53,624 --> 00:31:56,060
It's the evidence tag
from the PCP

00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,728
that killed Chelsea and Darlene.

00:32:21,385 --> 00:32:22,787
Hidden compartment.

00:32:22,787 --> 00:32:23,721
Yeah.

00:32:41,806 --> 00:32:43,808
What do you think?

00:32:43,808 --> 00:32:45,576
Evidence from another cold case?

00:32:45,576 --> 00:32:49,380
Maybe Richardson's got
more names on his list.

00:32:50,748 --> 00:32:52,583
Revenge.

00:32:52,583 --> 00:32:54,585
Cool and serve.

00:32:57,788 --> 00:32:59,423
I hope you got something.

00:32:59,423 --> 00:33:01,459
Nick and Sara couldn't
find any prints

00:33:01,459 --> 00:33:04,028
on Richardson's strongbox
or its contents,

00:33:04,028 --> 00:33:06,096
so whoever's doing this
is being very careful.

00:33:06,096 --> 00:33:09,533
Did you find any
potential victims?
(sighs)

00:33:09,533 --> 00:33:11,735
Talked with a dozen officers
who worked with Richardson.

00:33:11,735 --> 00:33:13,404
They got any
ideas who else

00:33:13,404 --> 00:33:15,573
was in his bucket list,
they're not saying.

00:33:15,573 --> 00:33:17,541
And skimming the cases he
worked, nothing stands out.

00:33:17,541 --> 00:33:18,976
There's plenty
of unsolveds,

00:33:18,976 --> 00:33:22,713
but no obvious ones
that got away.

00:33:22,713 --> 00:33:23,981
RUSSELL:
Sheriff Liston.

00:33:23,981 --> 00:33:25,983
Stan Richardson was
my first partner.

00:33:25,983 --> 00:33:28,385
Taught me everything
when I was a rookie.

00:33:28,385 --> 00:33:29,787
Taught a lot of cops.

00:33:29,787 --> 00:33:32,423
I don't know who
he's working with now,

00:33:32,423 --> 00:33:35,493
but I got a bad feeling
that's his next target.

00:33:38,996 --> 00:33:40,731
Rex Camford?
15 years back,

00:33:40,731 --> 00:33:42,466
Camford's wife
filed for divorce.

00:33:42,466 --> 00:33:43,801
Vanished the next night.

00:33:43,801 --> 00:33:45,436
Same night Camford
takes his boat out

00:33:45,436 --> 00:33:47,705
for a midnight cruise
on Lake Mead.

00:33:47,705 --> 00:33:49,573
All we had was
a handful

00:33:49,573 --> 00:33:51,475
of circumstantial
and a DA who shied

00:33:51,475 --> 00:33:54,011
from no-body cases.
No charges.

00:33:54,011 --> 00:33:56,013
No doubt in my mind
Camford killed his wife.

00:33:56,013 --> 00:33:58,415
What about Richardson,
did he feel the same way?

00:33:58,415 --> 00:34:00,117
Well, after I talked
his ear off about it

00:34:00,117 --> 00:34:01,919
for six whiskies straight
at the Blue Rail,

00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:03,787
he was madder than I was.

00:34:03,787 --> 00:34:06,457
Which is why I've
been trying to get
ahold of Camford.

00:34:06,457 --> 00:34:08,826
His housekeeper said
he didn't make it
home from work.

00:34:08,826 --> 00:34:09,960
Okay, why don't you...

00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,495
WILLOWS:
Sheriff.

00:34:11,495 --> 00:34:12,863
Ah, Catherine,
Sheriff's got a hunch

00:34:12,863 --> 00:34:14,098
about another
possible target.

00:34:14,098 --> 00:34:15,966
What do you have?

00:34:15,966 --> 00:34:19,370
Richardson's phone records
from the hospice.

00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:22,373
The only recent calls were
made from a disposable cell.

00:34:22,373 --> 00:34:24,008
Check out the times
of the calls.

00:34:24,008 --> 00:34:26,911
RUSSELL: They line up with
the times of the murders.

00:34:26,911 --> 00:34:28,412
Yeah.

00:34:28,412 --> 00:34:30,114
Someone has been keeping
Richardson updated

00:34:30,114 --> 00:34:31,782
on his progress.

00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:35,619
I was able to ping
the disposable cell.

00:34:35,619 --> 00:34:37,521
Signal hit tower 114

00:34:37,521 --> 00:34:40,024
from a southerly direction,
about five minutes ago.

00:34:40,024 --> 00:34:41,892
So...

00:34:41,892 --> 00:34:44,762
Richardson's wingman
is at Lake Mead.

00:34:44,762 --> 00:34:46,530
Good work.

00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:49,366
And what are the chances Rex
Camford's along for the ride?

00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:55,406
(sirens wailing)

00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:01,378
Detective Vega!
Show me your hands!

00:35:01,378 --> 00:35:02,613
Son of a bitch!

00:35:04,648 --> 00:35:05,883
BRASS:
Sam!

00:35:05,883 --> 00:35:07,384
We all know what Camford did,

00:35:07,384 --> 00:35:08,852
and we're gonna make
sure he pays for it.

00:35:08,852 --> 00:35:10,988
Let us handle it.
System had its chance, Jim!

00:35:10,988 --> 00:35:13,023
It didn't do jack!

00:35:13,023 --> 00:35:14,558
You know,
if it was just you and me,

00:35:14,558 --> 00:35:15,826
you'd be down here
helping me out.

00:35:15,826 --> 00:35:17,094
BRASS:
I'm trying to help you.

00:35:17,094 --> 00:35:19,096
Lose the piece,
and we're all good.

00:35:20,931 --> 00:35:22,533
Drop the gun, Sam.

00:35:22,533 --> 00:35:23,767
Hey, guys, he's not moving.

00:35:25,002 --> 00:35:26,737
Sam...
STOKES:
Come on, Sammy,

00:35:26,737 --> 00:35:28,505
we've been through
too much together, man.

00:35:28,505 --> 00:35:29,440
Let us help you out.

00:35:35,946 --> 00:35:37,348
Sure.

00:35:38,649 --> 00:35:40,684
You can help me out.

00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:42,920
BRASS:
No!

00:35:44,755 --> 00:35:46,657
Vega!
Vega!

00:35:47,725 --> 00:35:48,759
I got him!

00:35:50,894 --> 00:35:52,062
STOKES:
Get him up to the bank!

00:35:52,062 --> 00:35:52,997
Pull him up here!

00:35:54,765 --> 00:35:56,433
Come on, Vega,
stay with me.

00:35:56,433 --> 00:35:57,668
Stay with me, brother.

00:35:57,668 --> 00:35:58,802
Get him on his side.
Come on, now.

00:35:58,802 --> 00:36:00,004
Here we go...
STOKES: Vega!

00:36:01,972 --> 00:36:03,073
Yeah, we got a pulse.

00:36:03,073 --> 00:36:04,875
Go get an ambu-bag.
Go on.

00:36:04,875 --> 00:36:06,043
OFFICER:
He's gonna make it.

00:36:06,043 --> 00:36:07,845
No...
He's gone.

00:36:07,845 --> 00:36:08,979
Control, this is Brass.

00:36:08,979 --> 00:36:10,681
We have an officer down, 419.

00:36:10,681 --> 00:36:11,715
Hey, hurry up!

00:36:15,786 --> 00:36:18,589
All right,
here we go, buddy.

00:36:18,589 --> 00:36:20,457
Russell.

00:36:21,625 --> 00:36:22,726
Why don't you back off of him?

00:36:22,726 --> 00:36:24,528
Let-let them
handle it.

00:36:24,528 --> 00:36:25,829
They got it.

00:36:29,733 --> 00:36:31,669
One additional.

00:36:31,669 --> 00:36:33,437
Middle-aged man.

00:36:33,437 --> 00:36:35,639
Requires medical.

00:36:56,393 --> 00:36:59,763
Okay, bud, Denali's
all packed up.

00:36:59,763 --> 00:37:01,365
It's been a long night.

00:37:01,365 --> 00:37:02,900
You want to
hit the road?

00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,635
Yeah, we probably should.

00:37:04,635 --> 00:37:06,103
But let me ask you something.

00:37:06,103 --> 00:37:10,474
There are miles of secluded
shoreline on this lake,

00:37:10,474 --> 00:37:12,076
so why did Vega bring Rex here?

00:37:12,076 --> 00:37:14,111
Why this spot
in particular?

00:37:14,111 --> 00:37:16,980
Maybe with a gun to his head,
Rex was compelled to lead Vega

00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:19,516
to the very spot where
he dumped his wife.

00:37:21,985 --> 00:37:24,922
Now, that's interesting.

00:37:24,922 --> 00:37:27,057
What do you say
we wake somebody up.

00:37:36,433 --> 00:37:38,669
STOKES:
That looks like

00:37:38,669 --> 00:37:41,405
a skull.
Oh, yeah.

00:37:46,076 --> 00:37:47,745
Thank you, fellas.

00:37:47,745 --> 00:37:49,079
Look at that.

00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:51,648
Sharp orbital margins.

00:37:51,648 --> 00:37:53,350
Female.

00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:55,786
Shot in the back of
the head-- look at that.

00:37:55,786 --> 00:37:57,755
Probably dead before
she hit the water.

00:37:57,755 --> 00:37:59,656
You want to know
what I remember most

00:37:59,656 --> 00:38:01,625
about that Camford case
I worked back then?

00:38:03,127 --> 00:38:05,829
<i>This gorgeous Colt revolver</i>

00:38:05,829 --> 00:38:08,532
<i>sitting on that arrogant</i>
<i>bastard's desk.</i>

00:38:08,532 --> 00:38:10,100
<i>We still have it;</i>
<i>it's in evidence.</i>

00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:13,103
Richardson's not the only one
that holds on to stuff.

00:38:29,787 --> 00:38:31,789
(sighs)

00:38:31,789 --> 00:38:33,924
RICHARDSON:
<i>To my colleagues,</i>

00:38:33,924 --> 00:38:37,060
<i>who have shared the burden</i>
<i>of the badge.</i>

00:38:40,564 --> 00:38:43,634
<i>Many of you won't agree</i>
<i>with my methods,</i>

00:38:43,634 --> 00:38:45,102
<i>but all of you</i>
<i>will understand...</i>

00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:52,810
<i>...what it's like to have all</i>
<i>the pieces set before you...</i>

00:38:59,416 --> 00:39:02,452
<i>...the picture painted</i>
<i>broad and clear...</i>

00:39:08,592 --> 00:39:11,829
<i>...and watch</i>
<i>the killer walk away...</i>

00:39:13,931 --> 00:39:16,934
<i>...to live the life</i>
<i>they tore from others.</i>

00:39:19,136 --> 00:39:21,738
<i>Well, I could not</i>
<i>let that continue.</i>

00:39:24,007 --> 00:39:25,475
<i>I made a list.</i>

00:39:26,877 --> 00:39:29,613
<i>Five names.</i>

00:39:29,613 --> 00:39:32,683
<i>Those most deserving</i>
<i>of vengeance.</i>

00:39:34,518 --> 00:39:39,790
<i>And now, as I embark</i>
<i>into life's last mystery,</i>

00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:41,491
<i>I do so in peace.</i>

00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:46,029
<i>Detective Stanley Richardson,</i>

00:39:46,029 --> 00:39:48,365
<i>Las Vegas Police Department.</i>

00:39:50,367 --> 00:39:52,369
I heard about the letter.

00:39:52,369 --> 00:39:56,373
Guy certainly knew how
to get his message across.

00:39:56,373 --> 00:39:59,376
Well, cops can be

00:39:59,376 --> 00:40:03,113
refreshingly frank
sometimes, right?

00:40:05,949 --> 00:40:07,818
(sighs):
Listen...

00:40:07,818 --> 00:40:10,354
I know you and I
aren't gonna buy

00:40:10,354 --> 00:40:12,356
a summer house
together anytime soon,

00:40:12,356 --> 00:40:14,091
but I have a lot
of respect for you.

00:40:14,091 --> 00:40:15,893
Let's not forget,

00:40:15,893 --> 00:40:18,829
we did put away a wife-killer.

00:40:20,764 --> 00:40:24,635
Okay. Good talk.

00:40:24,635 --> 00:40:25,702
Hold on a minute.

00:40:27,404 --> 00:40:30,674
Richardson's letter
mentioned five names.

00:40:30,674 --> 00:40:33,610
Yeah, Vega was the fifth.

00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:38,415
There was a knife inside of
Richardson's lockbox.

00:40:38,415 --> 00:40:40,550
Sara found a little
blood inside of it,

00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:42,753
and it was a match to
a murdered informant

00:40:42,753 --> 00:40:45,522
that Vega had been
working a few years past.

00:40:45,522 --> 00:40:49,993
(sighs) Sam Vega could
always be a little, um...

00:40:49,993 --> 00:40:52,863
overzealous, especially
if he thought someone

00:40:52,863 --> 00:40:54,398
was holding out on him.

00:40:54,398 --> 00:40:55,799
You want my theory?

00:40:55,799 --> 00:40:58,502
Richardson knew
that Vega was dirty,

00:40:58,502 --> 00:40:59,870
kept the murder weapon,

00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:01,838
because he wanted Vega
to pay for his sins

00:41:01,838 --> 00:41:02,906
just like the rest of them.

00:41:07,978 --> 00:41:11,548
You know, it turns out both
funerals are on the same day.

00:41:11,548 --> 00:41:13,417
Vega and Richardson.

00:41:13,417 --> 00:41:15,953
Well...

00:41:15,953 --> 00:41:20,791
I thought I'd get up early,

00:41:20,791 --> 00:41:23,560
get on a motorcycle,

00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,729
and get very far out of town.

00:41:27,431 --> 00:41:29,032
I think that's a very good idea.
