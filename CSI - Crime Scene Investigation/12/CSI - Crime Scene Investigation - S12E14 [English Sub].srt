00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:06,899
You ever seen anything
like that?

00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:09,034
I don't even know
what I'm looking at.

00:00:09,034 --> 00:00:11,503
That's just wrong.

00:00:11,503 --> 00:00:13,038
Lucky for you,
I come prepared

00:00:13,038 --> 00:00:14,773
for this type of crisis.

00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:19,845
"Habanero Massacre"?

00:00:19,845 --> 00:00:21,914
Mmm!

00:00:21,914 --> 00:00:24,550
It's a mercy killing
on a burrito this bad.

00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:25,851
(car horn blaring)

00:00:25,851 --> 00:00:27,653
Whoa, whoa, whoa, girl.
You sure about that?

00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:29,955
(tires squealing, horn blowing)

00:00:41,433 --> 00:00:42,968
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:48,006
Control, this is CSI Brody.

00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:49,875
We've got a single-car
collision, Tropicana,

00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:52,110
block east of Nash,
injuries.

00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,545
Paramedics are
on their way.

00:00:53,545 --> 00:00:54,780
He's got a pulse,

00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,415
but he's lost a lot
of blood.

00:00:56,415 --> 00:00:57,950
He's got a really
nasty head wound here.

00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:59,051
We've gotta move.

00:00:59,051 --> 00:01:00,919
Engine's going up.

00:01:00,919 --> 00:01:02,454
All right, I'm gonna try
to get him out of here.

00:01:02,454 --> 00:01:03,755
Come on, boy, I got you.

00:01:03,755 --> 00:01:05,123
I'll get his legs.
Come on. Come on.

00:01:05,123 --> 00:01:07,426
Come on.

00:01:07,426 --> 00:01:08,760
Okay...

00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,562
Get him far enough back now.
I'm trying.

00:01:10,562 --> 00:01:11,730
Ah, that's good,
that's good.

00:01:16,168 --> 00:01:17,869
Wes Clyborn.

00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:18,904
Seven Hills address.

00:01:18,904 --> 00:01:21,073
Wes, Wes, my name's Nick.

00:01:21,073 --> 00:01:22,574
You hang in there now.

00:01:22,574 --> 00:01:23,609
Help's on the way.

00:01:23,609 --> 00:01:25,611
Damn.
What?

00:01:25,611 --> 00:01:27,713
He didn't hit his head.
This is a gunshot wound.

00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:30,549
I didn't hear a shot
before the crash.

00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:32,017
I definitely didn't hear two.

00:01:32,017 --> 00:01:34,653
I think that's
a second GSW to the abdomen.

00:01:34,653 --> 00:01:36,722
Looks like the same caliber.

00:01:36,722 --> 00:01:38,423
They're-they're-they're
bleeding.

00:01:38,423 --> 00:01:39,958
What are you
trying to say, Wes?

00:01:42,527 --> 00:01:43,662
They're dying.

00:01:43,662 --> 00:01:44,696
STOKES:
Who's dying, Wes?

00:01:44,696 --> 00:01:46,498
Wes, talk to me.

00:01:46,498 --> 00:01:47,566
Who's dying?

You're in good hands now, bud.

00:02:25,804 --> 00:02:27,472
They're gonna
take care of you.

00:02:27,472 --> 00:02:29,041
EMT: We've got a GSW
to head and abdomen.

00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:30,475
Okay. Get him on the monitor.

00:02:30,475 --> 00:02:32,010
Full set
of stat labs.

00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:34,713
Type and cross for packed
red cells for transfusion.

00:02:34,713 --> 00:02:37,582
(nurses conversing
indistinctly)

00:02:37,582 --> 00:02:39,818
We have O-neg
standing by.

00:02:39,818 --> 00:02:41,620
16 or 18 gauge.

00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,822
Excuse me, Nurse,
I'm with the Crime Lab.

00:02:43,822 --> 00:02:46,558
I'm gonna need to take the
clothes he's wearing
with me, okay?

00:02:46,558 --> 00:02:48,160
I'll see what I can do.

00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,161
Prep him for a central line.

00:02:49,161 --> 00:02:50,495
(alarm beeping)
Code blue.

00:02:50,495 --> 00:02:51,563
He's in V-Tach.

00:02:51,563 --> 00:02:52,764
DOCTOR:
Okay. Clear the room.

00:02:52,764 --> 00:02:54,900
That includes you, Crime Lab.

00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,868
Yes, sir.

00:02:56,868 --> 00:02:59,671
Thank you.
Charge to 200.

00:02:59,671 --> 00:03:01,540
100 milligrams.

00:03:05,911 --> 00:03:07,646
Hey.
Oh, hey.

00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:08,880
Morgan called.

00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,882
Told me you'd followed
the victim here.

00:03:10,882 --> 00:03:12,584
Wow, look at you.

00:03:12,584 --> 00:03:13,785
You all right?
Uh, yeah.

00:03:13,785 --> 00:03:15,454
I'm fine.

00:03:15,454 --> 00:03:17,656
But, man, this guy's
in really bad shape.

00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:18,924
And here's the thing.

00:03:18,924 --> 00:03:20,859
He said that
there are others,

00:03:20,859 --> 00:03:23,562
and that they're
dying or dead.

00:03:23,562 --> 00:03:25,430
I'm not really sure
what to make of it.

00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,099
So you think there's another
crime scene out there?

00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:29,067
Maybe more victims, too,
you know what I mean?

00:03:29,067 --> 00:03:30,869
Okay.

00:03:30,869 --> 00:03:32,671
Why don't you clean yourself up.

00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:35,574
I took the liberty of bringing
you a shirt from your locker.

00:03:35,574 --> 00:03:37,142
Thanks.
You hang here, if our guy

00:03:37,142 --> 00:03:39,878
pulls through, maybe
he'll tell you something.

00:03:39,878 --> 00:03:41,179
More than just "thank you."

00:03:42,781 --> 00:03:44,716
Hey, Nick...

00:03:44,716 --> 00:03:46,718
way to go.

00:03:46,718 --> 00:03:47,919
That took a lot of guts.

00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:49,421
Thanks.

00:03:56,795 --> 00:04:00,966
Registration belongs
to Elena Perez, 35.

00:04:00,966 --> 00:04:02,834
Vartann's checking out
her address.

00:04:02,834 --> 00:04:05,470
No known employer.

00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,906
Looks like she's been
living here.

00:04:07,906 --> 00:04:09,975
Blood on the headrest
is from transfer--

00:04:09,975 --> 00:04:12,144
Wes Clyborn's
head wound.

00:04:12,144 --> 00:04:14,579
No high-velocity
blood spatter.

00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:16,014
No gunshot.

00:04:16,014 --> 00:04:19,684
No HV on my side, either.

00:04:19,684 --> 00:04:23,522
Significant blood pool
on the driver's seat.

00:04:23,522 --> 00:04:25,457
Probably from the shot
to the abdomen.

00:04:25,457 --> 00:04:28,760
That's a lot of blood.
So...

00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,828
not shot in the car.

00:04:29,828 --> 00:04:31,797
Shot before he got in the car.

00:04:31,797 --> 00:04:34,099
Losing blood,
losing consciousness,

00:04:34,099 --> 00:04:36,935
he runs
into the billboard truck.

00:04:36,935 --> 00:04:38,570
You know,
considering his condition,

00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:39,971
he couldn't have
gotten more than a mile or two.

00:04:39,971 --> 00:04:41,907
Couple of square miles...

00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:44,476
and still a lot
of ground to cover.

00:04:44,476 --> 00:04:46,578
Our primary could be anywhere.

00:04:49,481 --> 00:04:50,782
Crime Lab.

00:04:50,782 --> 00:04:53,084
Hey. Well, I'm Nick. Stokes.

00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,486
What's your name?
I'm Lauren.

00:04:54,486 --> 00:04:55,554
Lauren, nice
to meet you.

00:04:55,554 --> 00:04:56,788
Nice to meet you, too.

00:04:56,788 --> 00:04:58,523
Yeah, thanks
for your help.
Sure.

00:04:58,523 --> 00:05:00,058
I have the patient's
clothing for you.

00:05:00,058 --> 00:05:01,493
Okay. Good.

00:05:01,493 --> 00:05:03,929
Sorry.
Got a little scissory.

00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:05,030
Oh, that's okay.

00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:07,766
So... how's he doing?

00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:09,601
He's good. Out of surgery.

00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:11,837
Stable. Oh...

00:05:11,837 --> 00:05:14,639
The doctor removed this
from Mr. Clyborn's abdomen.

00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,609
Fortunately, internal
damage was minimal.

00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:18,844
Only one bullet?

00:05:18,844 --> 00:05:20,045
The one that penetrated
his brain's

00:05:20,045 --> 00:05:22,047
gonna require
more attention.

00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:24,516
A neurosurgeon's
flying in from L.A.

00:05:28,086 --> 00:05:29,821
You've done this before.

00:05:29,821 --> 00:05:32,757
Yeah, more times than any
one person should have to.

00:05:34,826 --> 00:05:36,094
The owner of the Grand Am,
Elena Perez,

00:05:36,094 --> 00:05:37,929
was evicted from her place
a month ago.

00:05:37,929 --> 00:05:39,764
And no one has
reported her missing.

00:05:39,764 --> 00:05:41,867
So I'm working on a warrant
for her cell phone records.

00:05:41,867 --> 00:05:43,768
That might be the only
way to track her down.

00:05:43,768 --> 00:05:46,838
What about the cell phone that
Nick recovered from the victim?

00:05:46,838 --> 00:05:49,174
Yeah, Wes Clyborn.
He's a popular guy.

00:05:49,174 --> 00:05:51,576
I traced most of the calls
to his friends.

00:05:51,576 --> 00:05:53,044
And no one has ever heard
of Elena Perez,

00:05:53,044 --> 00:05:54,813
and nobody knew
where he was last night.

00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:57,182
One thing, though--
the last few calls,

00:05:57,182 --> 00:05:58,984
they were all made
to the same number.

00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:00,452
Do we know who?
There's no way to know.

00:06:00,452 --> 00:06:01,820
It was a
"pay-as-you-go" cell.

00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,821
Oh, great.

00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:04,189
So totally untraceable.

00:06:04,189 --> 00:06:06,758
Bullet entered the left
middle temporal lobe.

00:06:06,758 --> 00:06:09,094
Houses the hippocampus
and related structures.

00:06:09,094 --> 00:06:11,396
STOKES: <i>Those are areas related</i>
<i>to his memory, right?</i>

00:06:11,396 --> 00:06:12,497
DOCTOR:
<i>Right.</i>

00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:13,965
<i>Generally, retrograde amnesia</i>

00:06:13,965 --> 00:06:15,767
exhibits a temporal gradient.

00:06:15,767 --> 00:06:17,769
Last in, first out.

00:06:17,769 --> 00:06:20,405
So things he learned in school,
his mother's name,

00:06:20,405 --> 00:06:22,707
sense memories, there's a good
chance they remain

00:06:22,707 --> 00:06:24,609
But the memory of
who shot him last night...

00:06:24,609 --> 00:06:25,944
May or may not be there.
Okay.

00:06:25,944 --> 00:06:28,546
So is he conscious?
Fully.

00:06:28,546 --> 00:06:29,948
Soon as the neurosurgeon
arrives,

00:06:29,948 --> 00:06:32,117
we prep him for surgery,
take him in.

00:06:32,117 --> 00:06:33,952
What are his chances?

00:06:33,952 --> 00:06:35,921
I don't think we'll know
till we get in there.

00:06:35,921 --> 00:06:38,023
So if you're going
to talk to him, do it now.

00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:39,157
Appreciate it.
Yeah.

00:06:47,832 --> 00:06:50,101
(laughing):
Hey.

00:06:50,101 --> 00:06:51,102
Look at that.

00:06:51,102 --> 00:06:52,137
He's conscious.

00:06:52,137 --> 00:06:53,138
How you doing, man?

00:06:53,138 --> 00:06:54,139
You look good.

00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:55,473
Thank you.

00:06:55,473 --> 00:06:57,142
Yeah.
No.

00:06:57,142 --> 00:06:59,644
Thank you.

00:07:00,745 --> 00:07:03,882
The nurse said you saved me.

00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:05,750
Yeah.

00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:06,952
You don't remember
any of that, huh?

00:07:06,952 --> 00:07:07,953
(sighs)

00:07:07,953 --> 00:07:09,654
No. I'm sorry.

00:07:09,654 --> 00:07:11,122
Wait, you don't have to
apologize to me, man.

00:07:11,122 --> 00:07:12,490
You got a massive
head wound.

00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:14,693
It's gonna take
some time.

00:07:14,693 --> 00:07:17,595
So it's bad if the
beeps stop, right?

00:07:17,595 --> 00:07:19,698
It's not good, no.

00:07:19,698 --> 00:07:20,899
But don't worry
about that.

00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,901
That's not
gonna happen.

00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:25,103
Do me a favor, Wes.

00:07:25,103 --> 00:07:26,938
Let me see your hands.

00:07:26,938 --> 00:07:29,140
If you were in a struggle
with somebody, we might be able

00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,742
to find something
that can help us out here.

00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:31,743
Yeah, sure.

00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:32,978
Whatever you need.

00:07:34,679 --> 00:07:37,949
Ooh, looks like you put up
a hell of a fight.

00:07:37,949 --> 00:07:39,784
WOMAN:
<i>Why would anyone</i>

00:07:39,784 --> 00:07:41,519
want to hurt our son?
Did someone
try and rob him?

00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:42,954
We don't know that, sir.

00:07:42,954 --> 00:07:44,522
That's what we're
trying to find out.

00:07:44,522 --> 00:07:46,157
You guys have any idea
where he was last night?

00:07:46,157 --> 00:07:48,026
No.

00:07:48,026 --> 00:07:49,627
Well, do you know who
he might've been with?

00:07:49,627 --> 00:07:50,695
Wes has a lot of friends.

00:07:50,695 --> 00:07:52,030
STOKES:
Okay.

00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:53,932
But he still lives
at home with you, right?

00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:55,734
Yeah, since he
graduated in May.

00:07:55,734 --> 00:07:56,935
From 'SC.

00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:58,903
He's still exploring
his options.

00:07:58,903 --> 00:08:00,739
We give Wes his space.

00:08:00,739 --> 00:08:01,940
He comes and he goes.

00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,808
Not much more
we could tell you.

00:08:03,808 --> 00:08:05,710
Except that
he's a good boy.

00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:06,911
Do you recognize this woman?

00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,946
No.

00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:09,047
Why?

00:08:09,047 --> 00:08:10,648
Name's Elena Perez.

00:08:10,648 --> 00:08:11,983
She's the owner
of the car that Wes was driving.

00:08:11,983 --> 00:08:13,485
I've never seen her before.

00:08:13,485 --> 00:08:15,153
You're sure she's not
a friend of his?

00:08:15,153 --> 00:08:16,888
I've seen enough of Wes's
friends to know this woman

00:08:16,888 --> 00:08:18,690
would definitely not fit in
with any of them.

00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:19,891
Now, if you'll
excuse us...

00:08:19,891 --> 00:08:21,459
we'd like to see our son.

00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:30,135

the ones the guy in the hospital
was talking about.

00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:07,906
What do you mean
found them? Where?
Here.

00:09:07,906 --> 00:09:09,674
They're all over his shirt.

00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,142
No surprise I found
the victim's blood.

00:09:11,142 --> 00:09:13,778
But I found three
other contributors.

00:09:13,778 --> 00:09:15,480
Three other people.

00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,148
ANDREWS:
I know.

00:09:17,148 --> 00:09:18,583
Is Elena Perez one of them?

00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,852
Based on exemplars
from her car, yes.

00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:22,887
What about the other two?

00:09:22,887 --> 00:09:24,189
One is male.

00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:26,091
Familial match to Elena.

00:09:26,091 --> 00:09:27,892
I ran it through CODIS

00:09:27,892 --> 00:09:29,928
and got a hit on her
brother, Juan Perez.

00:09:29,928 --> 00:09:32,664
Convictions for assault,
armed robbery...

00:09:32,664 --> 00:09:34,866
and, oh, yeah, carjacking.

00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:36,101
Paroled six months ago.

00:09:36,101 --> 00:09:37,435
What about the last contributor?

00:09:37,435 --> 00:09:39,871
Unknown female.

00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:40,905
Wow.

00:09:40,905 --> 00:09:43,608
Look at all that carnage.

00:09:43,608 --> 00:09:44,843
Wonder what the hell happened

00:09:44,843 --> 00:09:46,578
right before Wes
Clyborn got in that car?

00:09:46,578 --> 00:09:47,879
I don't know.

00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,814
I can't get you any
closer to the primary.

00:09:49,814 --> 00:09:54,919
I don't have any answers about
what might have happened or how.

00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:55,954
Or why.

00:09:55,954 --> 00:09:58,723
All I have is blood.

00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,959
Sometimes blood is all you need.

00:10:02,127 --> 00:10:04,028
Oh, boy.

00:10:04,028 --> 00:10:05,029
Wish me luck.

00:10:05,029 --> 00:10:06,397
Where are you going?

00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:07,932
We need a blood whisperer.

00:10:21,713 --> 00:10:23,982
No signs of forced entry.

00:10:23,982 --> 00:10:26,751
Victim probably
knew her assailant.

00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:30,088
Could have been a hotel
employee who had a key...

00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:31,656
who had access.

00:10:33,158 --> 00:10:34,626
M.E. estimates time of death

00:10:34,626 --> 00:10:35,760
around midnight.

00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,695
C.O.D. is
blunt force trauma,

00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:40,398
consistent with the claw hammer.

00:10:40,398 --> 00:10:41,766
Yeah.

00:10:45,003 --> 00:10:46,771
Oh! You're killing me.

00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,673
Tell me something I don't know.

00:10:50,141 --> 00:10:51,976
Guys, your bosses

00:10:51,976 --> 00:10:54,546
are paying me a lot of money
for this seminar.

00:10:54,546 --> 00:10:56,414
Come on!

00:10:56,414 --> 00:10:58,082
Okay, I'll give you a hint.

00:10:58,082 --> 00:11:01,619
Look at my body.

00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:04,155
The position
of my body.

00:11:04,155 --> 00:11:06,057
Right, sorry, got it, um...

00:11:06,057 --> 00:11:07,559
(clears throat)

00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:08,826
Your hand appears to
be extending outward.

00:11:08,826 --> 00:11:09,827
Good, good.

00:11:09,827 --> 00:11:12,764
Why is that significant?

00:11:12,764 --> 00:11:14,599
Look at the
blood smear.

00:11:14,599 --> 00:11:16,868
I've made a blood angel here.
Why?

00:11:16,868 --> 00:11:19,404
RUSSELL:
Well, at first blush, it
looks like you're trying

00:11:19,404 --> 00:11:20,638
to reach your cell phone

00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,106
that fell under
the lamp there,

00:11:22,106 --> 00:11:24,809
but the blood angel shows
that your arm stopped,

00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,444
so you didn't get
the phone.

00:11:26,444 --> 00:11:28,446
You didn't call 911.

00:11:28,446 --> 00:11:29,747
You got any ideas?

00:11:29,747 --> 00:11:32,550
The assailant's
still in the room.

00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,819
She's afraid to call.

00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:35,820
Jules,

00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,822
what do you say?

00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:41,125
I say he's close, and there's
only one person in the world

00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:43,461
who would dare to call me Jules.

00:11:45,396 --> 00:11:47,699
(sighs)

00:11:47,699 --> 00:11:50,535
(chuckles)
Okay, guys,
that's a 482.

00:11:50,535 --> 00:11:52,470
We'll pick up after lunch.

00:11:57,709 --> 00:11:59,944
I know what
you're thinking.

00:11:59,944 --> 00:12:01,846
Of all the mock crime
scenes in all the world...

00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,982
No, that is not
what I'm thinking.

00:12:03,982 --> 00:12:06,117
It's good to see you.

00:12:06,117 --> 00:12:08,653
I like
your scene.
Are you
on the registration list?

00:12:08,653 --> 00:12:10,922
Uh, no.
Because I know
you don't like
to make social calls

00:12:10,922 --> 00:12:12,056
unless, of course,
you want to make

00:12:12,056 --> 00:12:13,057
your wife happy,
and I don't

00:12:13,057 --> 00:12:14,158
see her around.

00:12:14,158 --> 00:12:16,794
So what do you want,
Mr. Russell?

00:12:16,794 --> 00:12:18,930
Straight to the
point, as usual.

00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:22,600
Okay, uh... I need
a little help.

00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,535
Open case--

00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:29,707
blood's all we got, but,
oh, it's a good one.

00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:30,875
We know how it ended
last time.

00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,477
Yes, yes,

00:12:32,477 --> 00:12:35,146
that's true, uh, but
this is just one case.

00:12:35,146 --> 00:12:38,049
I'm already working
a crime scene.

00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:40,118
You sure?

00:12:40,118 --> 00:12:41,719
Yeah.
Okay.

00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,054
Well, worth a shot.

00:12:44,822 --> 00:12:46,924
Oh, yeah, uh, before
I go, I almost forgot.

00:12:46,924 --> 00:12:49,861
The assailant was
still in the room,

00:12:49,861 --> 00:12:52,130
uh, but your arm was
reaching out but not

00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:54,565
to grab your cell
phone but to motion

00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:57,101
to your daughter,
tell her to stay hidden.

00:12:59,937 --> 00:13:03,074
I know you... you think
you hate me,

00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:04,642
but the whole, uh,

00:13:04,642 --> 00:13:07,045
lying on the floor,
playing the victim thing

00:13:07,045 --> 00:13:08,780
kind of says you miss me.

00:13:11,449 --> 00:13:12,450
Or not.

00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:13,451
(claps hands)

00:13:13,451 --> 00:13:14,886
Okay.

00:13:16,988 --> 00:13:17,989
(grunts)

00:13:39,677 --> 00:13:40,712
Lauren.

00:13:40,712 --> 00:13:41,813
Hey.
Got your message.

00:13:41,813 --> 00:13:42,814
What's going on?

00:13:42,814 --> 00:13:44,449
It's Wes Clyborn.

00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:45,450
Is he all right?

00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:46,851
He's a little worked up.

00:13:46,851 --> 00:13:48,119
What do you mean?
Why?

00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:49,554
I don't know,
he won't talk to me.

00:13:49,554 --> 00:13:50,888
Keeps asking for you.

00:13:50,888 --> 00:13:52,156
All right, cool,
I'll talk to him.

00:13:52,156 --> 00:13:54,058
Okay.
Thanks.

00:13:54,058 --> 00:13:57,028
Hey, it's good
to see your appetite.

00:13:57,028 --> 00:13:58,596
But you didn't eat
the Jell-O.

00:13:58,596 --> 00:13:59,964
I remember something.

00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,766
Okay.

00:14:01,766 --> 00:14:04,068
Remember something
from last night?

00:14:04,068 --> 00:14:06,471
I was in a room.

00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:07,672
A room.

00:14:07,672 --> 00:14:09,640
What kind of room?
Do you recognize it?

00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,675
No, I'd never been
there before,

00:14:10,675 --> 00:14:15,513
but th-there was a man.

00:14:15,513 --> 00:14:16,748
And he had a gun.

00:14:16,748 --> 00:14:19,584
Do you recognize him,
know his name?

00:14:19,584 --> 00:14:20,785
No.

00:14:25,523 --> 00:14:28,426
Was it that dude?

00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,966
I tried to fight this guy off.

00:14:34,966 --> 00:14:36,667
Don't worry about it.
He had a gun.

00:14:40,972 --> 00:14:44,642
Next thing I remember,
I was running.

00:14:44,642 --> 00:14:48,146
I had car keys, but
they weren't mine.

00:14:48,146 --> 00:14:49,814
I-I took her car.

00:14:49,814 --> 00:14:50,948
Her?

00:14:50,948 --> 00:14:53,151
Do you mean Elena?
Elena Perez?

00:14:53,151 --> 00:14:54,819
(sighs)

00:14:54,819 --> 00:14:56,487
I don't know.
It's all right.

00:14:56,487 --> 00:14:57,989
Is that her?

00:15:03,961 --> 00:15:07,098
Yeah, yeah, sh-she
was there, but...

00:15:07,098 --> 00:15:10,501
th-th-there was somebody
else, another girl.

00:15:10,501 --> 00:15:11,502
Who?

00:15:11,502 --> 00:15:13,070
I can see her, she...

00:15:14,672 --> 00:15:16,007
She was beautiful.

00:15:16,007 --> 00:15:19,143
You, uh, you had this pendant
in your pocket.

00:15:19,143 --> 00:15:20,645
You were carrying
it around.

00:15:20,645 --> 00:15:22,013
It must be important.

00:15:22,013 --> 00:15:24,515
Think it was hers?

00:15:24,515 --> 00:15:27,018
(sighs)

00:15:27,018 --> 00:15:28,019

00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:29,120
Vicky?

00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,788
Her name's Vicky?
Yeah.

00:15:30,788 --> 00:15:32,790
(chuckling):
All right, all right,
that's good.

00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:35,159
That's going
to help us out.

00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:37,929
Listen, Wes...

00:15:37,929 --> 00:15:41,065
you and I are going
to figure this out together.

00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,534
We're gonna find Vicky

00:15:43,534 --> 00:15:45,570
and we're gonna find out
who did this to you.

00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,004
I promise.

00:16:25,176 --> 00:16:28,479
at a liquor store
robbery four weeks ago.

00:16:28,479 --> 00:16:30,147
Perp's still out there
along with the gun.

00:16:30,147 --> 00:16:33,184
Huh. Liquor store robbery
would match Juan Perez's M.O.

00:16:33,184 --> 00:16:35,019
And grabbing up

00:16:35,019 --> 00:16:37,588
two rich kids at gunpoint fits
with what Nick has gotten

00:16:37,588 --> 00:16:39,724
from Wes Clyborn
up to this point.

00:16:39,724 --> 00:16:42,793
So does Henry's
DNA report.

00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:45,396
The bullet had
Wes Clyborn's DNA.

00:16:45,396 --> 00:16:46,831
Well, that makes sense.
It also had

00:16:46,831 --> 00:16:49,567
tissue that belongs
to our unknown female.

00:16:49,567 --> 00:16:50,768
Well, that means...

00:16:53,504 --> 00:16:56,140
<i>...the bullet traveled</i>
<i>through our unknown female...</i>

00:16:58,676 --> 00:17:00,978
<i>...before landing</i>
<i>in Wes Clyborn.</i>

00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:03,414
Clyborn says he remembers
a girl named Vicky.

00:17:03,414 --> 00:17:04,982
She was with him
when he was shot.

00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:05,983
Girlfriend maybe.

00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:07,718
Through-and-through.

00:17:07,718 --> 00:17:10,454
The tissue on the bullet
says it wasn't a head shot.

00:17:10,454 --> 00:17:11,722
She could still be alive.

00:17:11,722 --> 00:17:12,890
She hasn't called for help.

00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:14,125
Well, maybe she can't.

00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:15,560
Maybe she's still being held.

00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,061
Bleeding out
on a floor somewhere.

00:17:17,061 --> 00:17:18,496
(sighs)

00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:19,864
Wes might have been
the lucky one.

00:17:27,104 --> 00:17:30,007
Think you're getting
kind of forgetful.

00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:33,611
Must be all of that Zen master
living-in-the-moment stuff.

00:17:33,611 --> 00:17:34,912
Yeah.

00:17:34,912 --> 00:17:35,913
At least
you remembered

00:17:35,913 --> 00:17:37,114
to put on socks.

00:17:37,114 --> 00:17:39,050
Did you take a look at it?

00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:41,986
Yes, I did.

00:17:41,986 --> 00:17:43,788
It <i>is</i> a good one.
Yeah.

00:17:43,788 --> 00:17:46,524
So?

00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:48,593
I want to have
some ground rules.

00:17:48,593 --> 00:17:50,995
Okay.
All right, number one,

00:17:50,995 --> 00:17:53,764
you are not to call me Jules
in front of other people.

00:17:53,764 --> 00:17:55,533
It is Finn.

00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:57,702
Finn.
Number two,

00:17:57,702 --> 00:18:01,172
we are never going
to talk about the past.

00:18:01,172 --> 00:18:04,442
Sounds to me like you want
to live in the moment.

00:18:04,442 --> 00:18:08,012
And when that Zen crap starts,
we need to have a safe word.

00:18:08,012 --> 00:18:10,047
Pick one.
Um...

00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,649
"Stop."

00:18:11,649 --> 00:18:12,750
Would that work?
You got it.

00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:13,985
All right.

00:18:13,985 --> 00:18:16,621
And what about you--
do you have any rules?

00:18:16,621 --> 00:18:19,090
I'm gonna have to hire
you on a temporary basis,

00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:20,825
uh, as a consultant.

00:18:20,825 --> 00:18:22,727
I've already run
that by HR.

00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:24,161
Of course you have.
And...

00:18:24,161 --> 00:18:27,698
legally, we need to pay
you a consulting fee.

00:18:33,771 --> 00:18:35,606
Figured the case

00:18:35,606 --> 00:18:38,576
was so fascinating, you'd
want to do it for nothing.

00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:41,112
You know me so well.

00:18:41,112 --> 00:18:44,982
And you know blood better
than anybody I know.

00:18:46,884 --> 00:18:50,554
All right, I want
your best DNA person.

00:18:50,554 --> 00:18:52,089
I don't want
your best tech.

00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:53,190
I want your best mind.

00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:54,525
You got it.

00:18:54,525 --> 00:18:56,527
You got me.

00:19:00,965 --> 00:19:02,099
FINN:
<i>Wow.</i>

00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,735
The case file
did not do this justice.

00:19:04,735 --> 00:19:06,504
Sanders, right?

00:19:06,504 --> 00:19:07,905
Uh, Greg.

00:19:07,905 --> 00:19:09,974
Finn.

00:19:09,974 --> 00:19:13,611
You know, I get the whole E.R.
urgency over evidence thing,

00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:16,113
but did you

00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,149
cut out all these samples?
No.

00:19:18,149 --> 00:19:20,418
But if I were still
working DNA, I would have.

00:19:20,418 --> 00:19:21,652
No, no, no,
it's not you.

00:19:21,652 --> 00:19:23,954
I get it, DNA is king
these days,

00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:26,057
but people don't understand
that blood spatter

00:19:26,057 --> 00:19:29,860
can often tell you more
than any test tube.

00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,062
Russell says
you're the man.

00:19:31,062 --> 00:19:32,830
Oh, did he?
Mm-hmm.

00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:37,068
Hmm, I try
my best.

00:19:37,068 --> 00:19:39,770
God, I hope somebody got some
pictures before the DNA moths

00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:42,707
got to this.

00:19:42,707 --> 00:19:44,141
(sighs)

00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,176
Great.

00:19:45,176 --> 00:19:46,844
(sighs)

00:19:46,844 --> 00:19:47,878
We're not totally screwed.

00:19:47,878 --> 00:19:48,913
Yeah, we're
pretty good

00:19:48,913 --> 00:19:50,514
about using cameras around here.

00:19:52,116 --> 00:19:53,451
Okay, we're going

00:19:53,451 --> 00:19:55,953
to reconstruct
all the blood events

00:19:55,953 --> 00:19:57,088
on these clothes

00:19:57,088 --> 00:19:58,689
and we're gonna map every inch

00:19:58,689 --> 00:20:00,124
by DNA contributor.

00:20:00,124 --> 00:20:02,526
I have the DNA
reports right here.

00:20:02,526 --> 00:20:03,761
Oh, good.

00:20:03,761 --> 00:20:05,830
Oh, do you have a dummy?

00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:08,532
♪ ♪

00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:19,043
(woman singing indistinctly)

00:20:19,043 --> 00:20:22,046
♪ ♪

00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:29,186
♪ ♪

00:20:43,167 --> 00:20:45,870
Wow, you truly are
the Blood Whisperer.

00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,972
Stop.

00:20:47,972 --> 00:20:51,008
Okay, so we've got
five blood events.

00:20:51,008 --> 00:20:53,144
My logic suggests
a certain order.

00:20:53,144 --> 00:20:54,979
Okay, let it bleed.

00:20:54,979 --> 00:20:57,014
All right, so your victim

00:20:57,014 --> 00:20:59,550
remembers a struggle

00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,552
with Juan Perez.

00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:03,754
Here is Juan's blood
on Wes's shirt.

00:21:03,754 --> 00:21:08,592
Pattern indicates blunt force
trauma, close quarters combat.

00:21:08,592 --> 00:21:10,594
But I don't think that Juan
was the only one

00:21:10,594 --> 00:21:12,129
in there fighting.

00:21:12,129 --> 00:21:13,864
RUSSELL:
Elena Perez.

00:21:13,864 --> 00:21:18,068
So... brother and sister were
both mixing it up with Wes.

00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:21,872
Both getting their blood on him,
and then, according to Wes,

00:21:21,872 --> 00:21:25,075
Juan goes ballistic--
literally--

00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:27,478
firing a bullet...

00:21:27,478 --> 00:21:30,548
through our unknown female
and into Wes.

00:21:30,548 --> 00:21:32,550
Okay, so that could be
girlfriend Vicky.

00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:34,185
Could be.

00:21:34,185 --> 00:21:36,587
Here's her HV spatter
from the through-and-through.

00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:39,557
Of course, nothing
says "fight over"

00:21:39,557 --> 00:21:41,525
like a good shot to the head.

00:21:44,962 --> 00:21:48,465
And so do the gravitational
drops from Wes's head shot,

00:21:48,465 --> 00:21:50,034
leaving the final
blood-soaked area

00:21:50,034 --> 00:21:52,069
from the abdominal
gunshot wound.

00:21:54,138 --> 00:21:55,539
Nice job.

00:21:55,539 --> 00:21:56,707
Thank you.

00:21:56,707 --> 00:21:57,942
So...

00:21:57,942 --> 00:22:01,045
our kid wrestles
with two assailants,

00:22:01,045 --> 00:22:02,780
gets shot twice.

00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,916
But how the hell
did he get out of there?

00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:07,785
Maybe he was left for dead.

00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:11,689
Well, that does not
bode well for Vicky.

00:22:11,689 --> 00:22:12,756
Hey, hey.
Hey.

00:22:12,756 --> 00:22:13,958
I talked
to Juan Perez's PO.

00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,593
He hasn't heard
from Juan in a week.

00:22:15,593 --> 00:22:17,461
No current address
and no job on file.
(growls)

00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,930
On the bright side,
I think I found Vicky.

00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:21,065
Really?

00:22:21,065 --> 00:22:22,700
How'd you do that so fast?

00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,468
I just did a web search, man.

00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:26,904
I punched in Vickys with
a connection to Wes Clyborn.

00:22:26,904 --> 00:22:28,439
Of course.

00:22:28,439 --> 00:22:31,108
I think I got a lot more
than I bargained for.

00:22:34,879 --> 00:22:37,514
A newsletter from
Jonah Clyborn's financial firm?

00:22:37,514 --> 00:22:38,616
Take a look
at the Christmas candids.

00:22:42,019 --> 00:22:43,687
Vicky Sheldon?

00:22:43,687 --> 00:22:44,922
Former assistant
to Jonah Clyborn,

00:22:44,922 --> 00:22:46,624
filed for unemployment
two months ago.

00:22:46,624 --> 00:22:48,659
It looks like she's holding
onto the boss pretty tight

00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:50,160
before he let her go.

00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,963
Yeah, maybe because she found
another Clyborn to hang onto.

00:22:52,963 --> 00:22:55,432
What do you mean?

00:22:55,432 --> 00:22:57,935
I went by Vicky Sheldon's place;
she wasn't there.

00:22:57,935 --> 00:23:00,471
Landlord said that he hasn't
seen her the past 24 hours,

00:23:00,471 --> 00:23:02,172
but he has seen plenty
of Wes Clyborn

00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:03,941
the last few months.

00:23:03,941 --> 00:23:07,578
Well, maybe this Juan
Perez dude graduated

00:23:07,578 --> 00:23:09,413
from carjacking to hit man.

00:23:09,413 --> 00:23:11,081
And maybe my next search
turns up a connection

00:23:11,081 --> 00:23:12,983
between him and the dad.

00:23:12,983 --> 00:23:15,119
You really think the old man
would put out a hit

00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:16,587
on his own son?
Hey,

00:23:16,587 --> 00:23:18,188
over a woman?

00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:21,425
Anything's possible,
I guess.
Look,

00:23:21,425 --> 00:23:22,760
you said it yourself, right?

00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,995
This guy isn't exactly
Mr. Warmth.

00:23:24,995 --> 00:23:27,932
No.

00:23:27,932 --> 00:23:29,667
No, he's not.

00:23:35,439 --> 00:23:36,774
Mr. Clyborn?

00:23:36,774 --> 00:23:39,510
Thank you
for coming down.

00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:42,780
I know you've already spoken to
my colleagues at the hospital,

00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,014
but I just

00:23:44,014 --> 00:23:45,683
have a few more questions
for you.

00:23:45,683 --> 00:23:47,117
What about?

00:23:47,117 --> 00:23:49,887
Vicky Sheldon.

00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:53,691
She worked for you
as your personal assistant

00:23:53,691 --> 00:23:54,758
for over a year.

00:23:54,758 --> 00:23:56,527
That is, right up until...

00:23:56,527 --> 00:23:58,729
two weeks ago,
when she was fired.

00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:00,864
Vicky was one of several
personal assistants.

00:24:00,864 --> 00:24:03,400
Yeah, but probably the only one
who's dating your son.

00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,568
Am I right?

00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:05,569
News to me.

00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:06,971
So,

00:24:06,971 --> 00:24:09,540
that wasn't the reason
why she got her pink slip?

00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,874
SIDLE:
<i>And...</i>

00:24:10,874 --> 00:24:12,910
how long have you known
about the relationship?

00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:15,012
Wes told me about it
a month ago.

00:24:15,012 --> 00:24:17,681
Do you approve?

00:24:17,681 --> 00:24:18,749
Wes is an adult.

00:24:18,749 --> 00:24:20,017
He makes his own decisions.

00:24:20,017 --> 00:24:22,052
That wasn't a yes.

00:24:22,052 --> 00:24:25,422
Honestly, I think
she was using my son.

00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,091
How's that?
While Vicky was employed

00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:30,527
by my husband, I learned that
Wes was supplementing her wages

00:24:30,527 --> 00:24:33,097
with checks drawn
from Jonah's business account.

00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:35,099
I told Jonah to fire her.

00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:38,535
Mrs. Clyborn, are you
sure that Wes was the one

00:24:38,535 --> 00:24:40,404
that was paying her bills?

00:24:40,404 --> 00:24:42,072
What exactly are you suggesting?

00:24:42,072 --> 00:24:43,540
RUSSELL:
<i>Okay, let's see.</i>

00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:45,576
Three days ago,
a car crashed into the wall

00:24:45,576 --> 00:24:47,478
outside of Vicky Sheldon's home.

00:24:47,478 --> 00:24:49,480
Just barely missed going
through her picture window.

00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,681
So?
So...

00:24:50,681 --> 00:24:52,416
by the time the police arrived,

00:24:52,416 --> 00:24:54,785
both the car
and the driver were gone.

00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:56,420
And Vicky didn't want
to talk about it,

00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:58,122
and nobody saw anything
but the car.

00:24:58,122 --> 00:25:01,859
Not many fender-busted Bentleys

00:25:01,859 --> 00:25:03,861
get sold for scrap around here.

00:25:03,861 --> 00:25:05,896
Oh, yeah, and, um,

00:25:05,896 --> 00:25:07,731
car's registered in your name.

00:25:07,731 --> 00:25:10,634
I wasn't driving it.

00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:14,004
Wes told me he hit
a fire hydrant.

00:25:14,004 --> 00:25:15,973
Well, that's got to be
a little infuriating.

00:25:15,973 --> 00:25:17,141
More engine than
he could handle.

00:25:17,141 --> 00:25:18,742
No, I mean,
kid lives at home,

00:25:18,742 --> 00:25:20,677
spends your money,
wrecks your car.

00:25:20,677 --> 00:25:21,912
Late at night,

00:25:21,912 --> 00:25:24,948
outside the home
of your ex... assistant.

00:25:24,948 --> 00:25:27,017
That's got to grind at you.

00:25:27,017 --> 00:25:30,020
I know you aren't
accusing me of something.

00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:32,623
If Wes wanted to go
slumming with the help,

00:25:32,623 --> 00:25:34,491
that was his prerogative.

00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:37,961
Kid didn't deserve
to get killed over it.

00:25:37,961 --> 00:25:39,997
But that's on him.

00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:41,932
Not me.

00:25:47,738 --> 00:25:49,406
(clears throat)

00:25:49,406 --> 00:25:50,507
Ah.

00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:52,443
New lab coats.

00:25:52,443 --> 00:25:53,644
Although,

00:25:53,644 --> 00:25:55,813
I ordered periwinkle,
not royal blue.

00:25:55,813 --> 00:25:57,714
They're not for you.

00:25:57,714 --> 00:26:00,951
This work smock is from the
trunk of Elena Perez's car.

00:26:00,951 --> 00:26:02,553
And this one, I just found

00:26:02,553 --> 00:26:04,121
searching Vicky
Sheldon's apartment.

00:26:04,121 --> 00:26:06,123
Vicky and Elena worked together?

00:26:06,123 --> 00:26:08,058
Identical smocks.

00:26:08,058 --> 00:26:09,993
And they definitely
know each other.

00:26:09,993 --> 00:26:12,596
I found Elena's number written
on a note in Vicky's place.

00:26:12,596 --> 00:26:14,598
Working with a lady
who's living in her car.

00:26:14,598 --> 00:26:17,401
That's a doozy of a drop
from Vicky's previous job.

00:26:17,401 --> 00:26:19,570
So maybe Vicky wanted
to cushion the fall

00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:20,938
with some Clyborn money.

00:26:20,938 --> 00:26:23,073
Got Juan and Elena
to help her rob Wes,

00:26:23,073 --> 00:26:25,943
the rip-off went bad,
and Wes escaped?

00:26:25,943 --> 00:26:27,511
<i>Laverne and Shirley</i>
go femme fatale.

00:26:27,511 --> 00:26:28,879
Love it.
And I would love

00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:30,981
to know where those
smocks were employed.

00:26:30,981 --> 00:26:32,649
Can you please
check them for trace?

00:26:32,649 --> 00:26:35,018
Any answer could help
us find our primary.

00:26:41,692 --> 00:26:43,827
Hey.
Hey.

00:26:43,827 --> 00:26:45,129
Finally got
cell phone records

00:26:45,129 --> 00:26:47,664
for Wes, Juan and
Elena last night.

00:26:47,664 --> 00:26:49,600
Last calls were made
at the same time

00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,834
in the same vicinity.

00:26:50,834 --> 00:26:52,669
Got the cell phone towers.

00:26:52,669 --> 00:26:54,171
Let's see where
the coverage overlaps.

00:26:54,171 --> 00:26:57,474
Overlap places all
three callers...

00:26:57,474 --> 00:26:58,675
(beeping)
Here.

00:26:58,675 --> 00:27:01,111
STOKES:
Arroyo Horizons Business Park.

00:27:01,111 --> 00:27:03,413
Why would they all be there
on a Saturday night?

00:27:07,551 --> 00:27:08,886
LVPD.

00:27:15,692 --> 00:27:17,161
Site manager said

00:27:17,161 --> 00:27:19,663
this was the only facility
that wasn't locked down.

00:27:24,101 --> 00:27:26,003
Got blood.

00:27:26,003 --> 00:27:28,539
Shoe impression.

00:27:28,539 --> 00:27:30,807
Yep.

00:27:30,807 --> 00:27:32,109
Looks like it's coming
from back there.

00:27:54,398 --> 00:27:55,632
STOKES:
Vicky Sheldon.

00:27:58,669 --> 00:27:59,803
Body's cold.

00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:00,938
She's been here
for a while.

00:28:00,938 --> 00:28:02,706
Same story here.

00:28:07,077 --> 00:28:08,078
Elena Perez?

00:28:08,078 --> 00:28:09,846
It's hard to tell

00:28:09,846 --> 00:28:12,049
from what's left of her face.

00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:23,760
What the hell happened in here?

00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,995
Well, it's not like
Wes Clyborn

00:28:24,995 --> 00:28:26,530
can really help us out
right now.

00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:27,664
No, but I know who can.

00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:29,032
Yeah, the only guy we know

00:28:29,032 --> 00:28:30,400
who walked out of here.

00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,535
Juan Perez.

00:28:31,535 --> 00:28:32,669
He's got a lot to answer for.

00:28:37,407 --> 00:28:39,776
(shutters clicking)

00:28:39,776 --> 00:28:42,613
Fabulous Las Vegas.

00:28:42,613 --> 00:28:44,781
Not so fabulous for her.

00:28:44,781 --> 00:28:45,882
SIDLE:
Elena Perez's car

00:28:45,882 --> 00:28:47,618
said she was down on her luck.

00:28:47,618 --> 00:28:50,153
Looks like her luck ran out.

00:28:50,153 --> 00:28:52,189
Still in full rigor.

00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:53,757
T.O.D. is approximately

00:28:53,757 --> 00:28:55,425
18 to 24 hours ago.

00:28:55,425 --> 00:28:56,827
Same time frame

00:28:56,827 --> 00:28:58,495
as this poor girl.

00:28:58,495 --> 00:29:01,965
Vicky Sheldon, GSW
through and through.

00:29:01,965 --> 00:29:03,767
There's quite a
blood pool here.

00:29:03,767 --> 00:29:06,169
ROBBINS:
Bullet probably severed
her left hepatic artery.

00:29:06,169 --> 00:29:08,005
Well, if that's the case,

00:29:08,005 --> 00:29:10,507
she lost consciousness and
then bled out rather quickly.

00:29:10,507 --> 00:29:12,876
PHILLIPS: Got off easy
compared to her friend.

00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:14,711
SIDLE:
Massive blunt force trauma.

00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:17,080
Nearly every bone
in her face is smashed.

00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,081
SIDLE:
Overkill.

00:29:18,081 --> 00:29:19,583
Rage.

00:29:19,583 --> 00:29:22,519
The wounds
show a distinctive pattern.

00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:24,788
Could be brass
knuckles maybe.
Maybe.

00:29:24,788 --> 00:29:27,090
But how do you explain
the punctures?

00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,795
I might be able
to answer that question.

00:29:31,795 --> 00:29:35,065
Brass knuckles included.

00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:36,066
Could have a partial

00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:37,534
palm print here.

00:29:37,534 --> 00:29:39,469
Looks like what happened
in Las Vegas

00:29:39,469 --> 00:29:41,571
kind of stayed on Las Vegas.

00:29:44,708 --> 00:29:47,778
Well, I see your palm print,
and I raise you

00:29:47,778 --> 00:29:50,647
a knee impression
and a footprint.

00:29:50,647 --> 00:29:52,849
What kind of shoes
was Wes Clyborn wearing?

00:29:52,849 --> 00:29:54,518
Uh, dress shoes.

00:29:54,518 --> 00:29:55,852
Why?
These aren't dress shoes.

00:29:55,852 --> 00:29:57,654
They're work boots.

00:29:57,654 --> 00:30:01,658
And they look like they are
hauling ass out of here.

00:30:01,658 --> 00:30:03,126
Right out the back door.

00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:17,841
Work boots weren't
the only thing hauling ass.

00:30:17,841 --> 00:30:20,644
Mm-hmm.

00:30:20,644 --> 00:30:23,914
Tire treads
and boot prints.

00:30:23,914 --> 00:30:25,449
Got some paint.

00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:27,918
Could be transfer.

00:30:30,087 --> 00:30:32,022
It looks like we've got
some trace here.

00:30:38,729 --> 00:30:40,430
White and crusty.

00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:47,037
Not much different
than what's in your fridge.

00:30:47,037 --> 00:30:49,740
Sodium bicarbonate.

00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:50,974
Trace from the boot print

00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:52,676
is baking soda?

00:30:52,676 --> 00:30:54,544
HODGES:
Specifically, the chemical
formulation used

00:30:54,544 --> 00:30:55,812
in industrial cleaning supplies.

00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:57,147
Still pretty generic.

00:30:57,147 --> 00:30:58,915
Doesn't get us any closer
to tracking Juan.

00:30:58,915 --> 00:31:01,551
Well, if you want unique,

00:31:01,551 --> 00:31:04,988
I've got just your color.

00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:06,790
Royal crimson metallic.

00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:08,725
Auto paint transfer
from the loading bay

00:31:08,725 --> 00:31:09,993
at the crime scene.

00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:12,596
Used exclusively
on one vehicle model,

00:31:12,596 --> 00:31:14,398
Austin Healy B-100.

00:31:14,398 --> 00:31:16,733
From 1955 to 1957.

00:31:16,733 --> 00:31:18,502
That's a hell of a nice car.

00:31:18,502 --> 00:31:20,771
I don't see Juan
Perez owning it.

00:31:20,771 --> 00:31:23,907
Maybe he was working on it.

00:31:23,907 --> 00:31:25,809
Soda blasting.

00:31:25,809 --> 00:31:27,043
Sodium bicarbonate

00:31:27,043 --> 00:31:28,779
applied through
compressed air.

00:31:28,779 --> 00:31:31,181
Used by auto-detailing places
to prep a car

00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:33,016
that's about
to be repainted.

00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:34,918
Perhaps with royal
crimson metallic.

00:31:34,918 --> 00:31:37,053
Maybe Juan borrowed the car.

00:31:37,053 --> 00:31:41,558
If you owned a classic ride
like a '56 Austin Healy,

00:31:41,558 --> 00:31:43,994
I doubt you'd take it
to the corner body shop.
No.

00:31:43,994 --> 00:31:47,097
I'd go to the best
to pimp my ride.

I've been busy today.

00:33:54,057 --> 00:33:56,393
We recovered
Juan Perez's gun.

00:33:56,393 --> 00:33:57,861
We're running it.

00:33:57,861 --> 00:34:00,964

that Juan fired that gun.

00:34:00,964 --> 00:34:03,033
All right.

00:34:03,033 --> 00:34:07,604
Blood pools from Wes Clyborn's
two gunshot wounds.

00:34:07,604 --> 00:34:10,006
He was shot standing, falls.

00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:13,109
Bleeds from the head
and the gut.

00:34:13,109 --> 00:34:16,046
And over here, HV spatter,
another blood pool.

00:34:16,046 --> 00:34:17,814
RUSSELL: Which comes
from Vicky Sheldon's GSW,

00:34:17,814 --> 00:34:19,015
the through-and-through,

00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:20,684
which ends up in Wes.

00:34:20,684 --> 00:34:23,453
Okay, so, bang, bang.

00:34:23,453 --> 00:34:25,155
Two gunshot victims.

00:34:25,155 --> 00:34:27,591
Efficient, expedient.

00:34:27,591 --> 00:34:31,127
Nothing in common...
with this.

00:34:31,127 --> 00:34:32,662
The beating

00:34:32,662 --> 00:34:34,764
of Elena Perez.
Yeah.

00:34:34,764 --> 00:34:36,700
Look at all of that blood.

00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,068
Not efficient.

00:34:38,068 --> 00:34:39,469
Not expedient.

00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:41,037
No. I calculated

00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:43,873
roughly ten to 12 blows
to the head

00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:45,141
with the murder weapon.

00:34:45,141 --> 00:34:48,645
And then this knee impression.
At first,

00:34:48,645 --> 00:34:50,680
I thought
that it was the killer.

00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,649
But the void from the castoff
and spatter

00:34:52,649 --> 00:34:54,584
is actually
on the other side of her.

00:34:54,584 --> 00:34:56,753
So, the killer was on
this side, which means

00:34:56,753 --> 00:34:59,556
that the knee impression
was not from the killer.

00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:02,459
It was from somebody who came
after the beating.

00:35:02,459 --> 00:35:04,160
Maybe somebody
who wanted to help.

00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,996
Somebody like a brother.

00:35:05,996 --> 00:35:09,099
Where are you going with this?

00:35:09,099 --> 00:35:10,767
Juan may have pulled
the trigger,

00:35:10,767 --> 00:35:12,736
but I don't think
he was the trigger.

00:35:12,736 --> 00:35:14,537
It's a little Zen.

00:35:14,537 --> 00:35:16,106
Okay, so,

00:35:16,106 --> 00:35:18,608
our current assumption
is that Juan Perez

00:35:18,608 --> 00:35:22,012
held Wes Clyborn here
at gunpoint, right?

00:35:22,012 --> 00:35:23,179
Right.
All right.

00:35:23,179 --> 00:35:24,814
So, let me ask
you a question.

00:35:24,814 --> 00:35:27,450
You're an ex-con with a gun

00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:29,919
at my back.

00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:32,088
Okay.
And you are

00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:34,858
ready to use it.

00:35:34,858 --> 00:35:36,459
Oh! (chuckles)

00:35:36,459 --> 00:35:37,727
Where's my safe word?

00:35:37,727 --> 00:35:38,995
You don't need one.

00:35:38,995 --> 00:35:41,765
You have a gun...
and I don't.

00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:45,869
And all of this blood says
that I managed

00:35:45,869 --> 00:35:48,004
to punch you in the face,
not once,

00:35:48,004 --> 00:35:50,573
but over half a dozen times.

00:35:52,409 --> 00:35:57,514
A rich kid takes down
an ex-con with a gun?

00:35:57,514 --> 00:35:58,948
How does that happen?

00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:02,719
It doesn't.

00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:05,088
You make a good case.

00:36:05,088 --> 00:36:08,024
Juan Perez's blood
makes the case.

00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:13,029
He may have walked out
with that gun,

00:36:13,029 --> 00:36:16,433
but I don't think
he brought it.

00:36:16,433 --> 00:36:20,437
Doesn't look good, Juan.

00:36:20,437 --> 00:36:22,539
Career criminal
running from the cops,

00:36:22,539 --> 00:36:24,574
gun with your prints
found in your work locker.

00:36:24,574 --> 00:36:25,909
So why all
the talk?

00:36:25,909 --> 00:36:29,879
I mean, you got me,
and you got the gun.

00:36:29,879 --> 00:36:31,147
And ballistics confirms

00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:33,016
that you used it
against Wes Clyborn

00:36:33,016 --> 00:36:34,651
and Vicky Sheldon.

00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:36,086
If you don't mind,
I have one question.

00:36:36,086 --> 00:36:38,188
Am I going to give it up,

00:36:38,188 --> 00:36:40,590
right?

00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:42,459
Why else you think
I'm sitting here

00:36:42,459 --> 00:36:44,894
without some half-asleep,
court-appointed,

00:36:44,894 --> 00:36:46,896
public pretender
sitting next to me?

00:36:46,896 --> 00:36:48,565
That wasn't my question.

00:36:48,565 --> 00:36:51,568
We have your sister Elena's
cell phone records

00:36:51,568 --> 00:36:53,103
that shows that

00:36:53,103 --> 00:36:54,771
she called you
the night of the murders.

00:36:54,771 --> 00:36:56,906
My question is, why?

00:36:56,906 --> 00:36:58,808
Why do you think?

00:36:58,808 --> 00:37:01,745
I think she needed you

00:37:01,745 --> 00:37:05,081
because she was scared
for herself

00:37:05,081 --> 00:37:06,716
and her friend Vicky,

00:37:06,716 --> 00:37:09,185
whose ex had been calling her
all night long.

00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:11,521
He tried to ram his car
through her apartment

00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:13,857
a couple of days
before that,

00:37:13,857 --> 00:37:16,860
but now he had a bigger head
of steam going.

00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:19,062
He wanted what was his...

00:37:19,062 --> 00:37:21,898
and he came for it.

00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,402
Vicky...
It's over!

00:37:29,639 --> 00:37:30,740
You got that part right.

00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:32,675
Hey!

00:37:32,675 --> 00:37:34,444
What's going on?

00:37:34,444 --> 00:37:36,412
RUSSELL:
How am I doing so far?

00:37:36,412 --> 00:37:38,481
You were just trying
to protect your sister.

00:37:38,481 --> 00:37:41,084
You just didn't count
on the rich boy

00:37:41,084 --> 00:37:43,553
having brought a street gun
to the party.

00:37:43,553 --> 00:37:45,688
(grunting)

00:37:49,926 --> 00:37:50,960
(grunting)

00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,763
(yelping)

00:37:53,763 --> 00:37:57,167
(screaming)

00:37:57,167 --> 00:37:58,768
RUSSELL:
<i>You came to,</i>

00:37:58,768 --> 00:38:01,104
<i>you saw Wes</i>
<i>beating your sister,</i>

00:38:01,104 --> 00:38:02,739
<i>and you had to stop him.</i>

00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:04,007
<i>You had to protect the family.</i>

00:38:04,007 --> 00:38:05,842
Get off her!

00:38:05,842 --> 00:38:09,045
Juan, put the gun down, please!

00:38:09,045 --> 00:38:11,781
(gunshot)

00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:17,554
You had no other choice.

00:38:17,554 --> 00:38:21,124
(whimpering)

00:38:21,124 --> 00:38:23,193
RUSSELL:
<i>Your sister was already dead.</i>

00:38:23,193 --> 00:38:27,030
<i>You knew how things would look,</i>
<i>so you ran.</i>

00:38:39,075 --> 00:38:42,145
This is your lucky day.

00:38:42,145 --> 00:38:43,913
There's the pen,

00:38:43,913 --> 00:38:45,815
and there's the paper.

00:38:45,815 --> 00:38:47,784
Write it down.

00:38:52,422 --> 00:38:54,457
(sniffles)

00:38:56,793 --> 00:38:58,761
Yeah, I was always
the troublemaker.

00:38:58,761 --> 00:39:01,097
Life wasn't fair,

00:39:01,097 --> 00:39:02,832
so I made it fair.

00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:10,406
But Elena never complained.

00:39:10,406 --> 00:39:13,443
Elena worked hard.

00:39:13,443 --> 00:39:14,777
Elena had faith.

00:39:14,777 --> 00:39:16,880
(voice breaking):
And the one time

00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,549
that she needed me--

00:39:19,549 --> 00:39:23,019
someone like me...

00:39:23,019 --> 00:39:25,521
...I failed her.

00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:29,759
(sniffles)

00:39:34,464 --> 00:39:36,532
How the hell do you know
what went on in that room?

00:39:36,532 --> 00:39:39,636
I have
a very smart friend.

00:39:41,905 --> 00:39:44,440
She's your friend, too.

00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,042
(sniffles)

00:39:58,888 --> 00:40:01,758
Give us a minute, will you?

00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:08,564
Tried to take my hallway walk.

00:40:08,564 --> 00:40:10,767
Cops wouldn't let me leave.

00:40:13,736 --> 00:40:16,572
I'm not going home...

00:40:16,572 --> 00:40:17,774
am I?

00:40:17,774 --> 00:40:19,742
No.

00:40:19,742 --> 00:40:22,712
Did I hurt Vicky?

00:40:22,712 --> 00:40:26,549
You hurt 'em all, Wes.

00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:30,553
Two people are dead
because of you.

00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:32,789
I remembered something
this morning.

00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:36,592
I loved her.

00:40:36,592 --> 00:40:37,694
(sighs)

00:40:37,694 --> 00:40:39,696
I know I did.

00:40:39,696 --> 00:40:43,766
The person you say did this...

00:40:46,803 --> 00:40:48,738
...I don't even know him.

00:40:51,541 --> 00:40:53,009
Neither do I, man.

00:41:08,925 --> 00:41:10,860
That was very nicely done.

00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:12,528
You did all the work.

00:41:12,528 --> 00:41:14,464
I did, didn't I?

00:41:14,464 --> 00:41:16,799
And here's your...

00:41:16,799 --> 00:41:19,035
dollar back.

00:41:19,035 --> 00:41:20,570
Like you said,

00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:22,505
I'm not really in it
for the money.

00:41:22,505 --> 00:41:25,575
Don't you ever miss it?

00:41:25,575 --> 00:41:27,110
I mean, you've been out
of the game now,

00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,444
how long?

00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:29,779
You know how long.

00:41:29,779 --> 00:41:31,681
You want back in?

00:41:31,681 --> 00:41:33,816
You asking?
Oh, come on.

00:41:33,816 --> 00:41:35,485
Don't make me beg.

00:41:35,485 --> 00:41:37,820
I like it when you beg.

00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:40,490
I have my own envelope.

00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:42,025
My expenses.

00:41:42,025 --> 00:41:45,528
Party table rental,
two smocks, some paints.

00:41:45,528 --> 00:41:46,629
It's all in there.

00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:48,598
Come on. What do you think?

00:41:48,598 --> 00:41:50,066
(sighs)
I don't know.

00:41:50,066 --> 00:41:51,801
I really don't know.

00:41:51,801 --> 00:41:53,503
Okay.

00:41:53,503 --> 00:41:55,605
I will think about it.

00:42:01,177 --> 00:42:03,446
I may call you.

00:42:03,446 --> 00:42:05,815
I may answer.

00:42:08,084 --> 00:42:09,085
Wait. Whoa.

00:42:09,085 --> 00:42:11,888
Whoa-ho!

00:42:11,888 --> 00:42:14,690
Nobody calls me Diebenkorn
around here.

00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:15,725
It's D.B.
