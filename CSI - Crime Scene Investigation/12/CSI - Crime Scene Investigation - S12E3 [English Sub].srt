00:00:16,863 --> 00:00:19,065
Five grand?!

00:00:19,065 --> 00:00:22,035
For this?!

00:00:22,035 --> 00:00:23,236
It speaks to me.

00:00:23,236 --> 00:00:24,904
Really.

00:00:24,904 --> 00:00:27,140
Well, look at the face--
no expression.

00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:29,709
'Cause it's a
frying pan.

00:00:31,578 --> 00:00:32,646
Come over here.

00:00:39,085 --> 00:00:40,687
Now are you getting hungry?

00:00:40,687 --> 00:00:42,789
The Golden Nugget has a
really good steak house.

00:00:42,789 --> 00:00:44,524
Come on, Nick,
just give it a try.

00:00:44,524 --> 00:00:45,725
(groans)

00:00:45,725 --> 00:00:47,227
Tell me what you see.

00:00:47,227 --> 00:00:48,828
Okay, uh,

00:00:48,828 --> 00:00:50,230
a banged-up muffler.

00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:51,598
Says to me:

00:00:51,598 --> 00:00:52,599
Car accident.

00:00:52,599 --> 00:00:53,633
(both laughing)

00:00:53,633 --> 00:00:54,701
No?

00:00:54,701 --> 00:00:56,036
What then?

00:00:56,036 --> 00:00:59,739
Mm... says to me...

00:00:59,739 --> 00:01:01,975
two people breaking down
the walls

00:01:01,975 --> 00:01:04,678
that they've built
around their hearts,

00:01:04,678 --> 00:01:06,846
surrendering to their
innermost feelings.

00:01:08,782 --> 00:01:10,050
That's really nice.

00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:11,918
Thank you.

00:01:11,918 --> 00:01:15,755
All right, okay, I can
do some curating here.

00:01:18,024 --> 00:01:21,861
Oh, boy, this one's
yelling at me.

00:01:21,861 --> 00:01:23,763
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

00:01:23,763 --> 00:01:27,133
Yeah, the cement,
the brick, the metal...

00:01:27,133 --> 00:01:28,968
It's very heavy.

00:01:28,968 --> 00:01:31,571
We all carry a load
in this life

00:01:31,571 --> 00:01:34,140
and if we can't
overcome our burdens,

00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,842
we'll be crushed
like a beer can.

00:01:35,842 --> 00:01:37,510
That was beautiful.

00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:39,713
Thank you.

00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:47,153
Oh, wow! It's interactive.

00:01:50,557 --> 00:01:52,092
Whew.

00:01:52,092 --> 00:01:53,860
You know what
it's telling me now?

00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,729
What?

00:01:55,729 --> 00:01:57,831
This date's over.

00:01:58,965 --> 00:02:00,133
Hi.

00:02:00,133 --> 00:02:01,034
Thank you.

00:02:07,674 --> 00:02:08,842
Nice catch.

00:02:08,842 --> 00:02:10,810
It's definitely human.

00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:13,079
You think there's
a real arm in there?

00:02:13,079 --> 00:02:14,781
At these prices,

00:02:14,781 --> 00:02:16,249
I'm thinking an arm and a leg.

00:02:18,852 --> 00:02:20,720
Hey, come here.

00:02:23,256 --> 00:02:25,558
Which one is she?
Hmm?

00:02:25,558 --> 00:02:26,993
Oh, come on.

00:02:26,993 --> 00:02:28,995
Art gallery opening.
It's not your thing.

00:02:28,995 --> 00:02:30,964
You're on a date, right?

00:02:30,964 --> 00:02:32,098
What?

00:02:32,098 --> 00:02:33,600
No, wait, wait--
let me guess.

00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,634
The pretty brunette?

00:02:34,634 --> 00:02:36,236
It's Doc Robbins' niece.

00:02:36,236 --> 00:02:38,071
She's in from Ohio.
I'm just showing her around.

00:02:38,071 --> 00:02:39,873
It's one date
she'll never forget.

00:02:39,873 --> 00:02:40,807
Mm.

00:02:42,842 --> 00:02:44,611
See, am I crazy?

00:02:44,611 --> 00:02:46,646
What do you see?

00:02:46,646 --> 00:02:48,581
Please don't start that.

00:02:48,581 --> 00:02:50,583
Well...

00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:52,152
I wouldn't be putting
my face in there.

00:02:52,152 --> 00:02:53,153
Yeah, you know what?

00:02:53,153 --> 00:02:54,087
You're right. You do it.

00:02:55,755 --> 00:02:57,056
That's an order.

00:03:03,163 --> 00:03:06,966
STOKES:
Nose, cheekbone, eye socket.

00:03:06,966 --> 00:03:09,269
Half a face, right?

00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:11,204
Yeah, looks like it.

00:03:11,204 --> 00:03:12,839
Is there an artist
in the house here?

00:03:12,839 --> 00:03:15,175
Yeah.

00:03:15,175 --> 00:03:16,242
Come here.

00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:18,878
I'm-I'm the artist.

00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:20,180
STOKES:
Name?

00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,948
Slade.

00:03:21,948 --> 00:03:23,149
What's your last
name, Slade?

00:03:23,149 --> 00:03:24,551
Just Slade.

00:03:24,551 --> 00:03:25,985
Well, this is just Stokes

00:03:25,985 --> 00:03:28,087
and I'm just Russell,
crime lab.

00:03:28,087 --> 00:03:29,989
We love what
you're doing here.

00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:32,225
The cement's fresh,
the hint of decomp.

00:03:32,225 --> 00:03:33,827
It's nice.

00:03:33,827 --> 00:03:36,696
Maybe you better tell us
about your process.

00:03:36,696 --> 00:03:38,531
I'm an artist, man.

00:03:38,531 --> 00:03:40,166
I find things.

00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:42,101
They tell me
what they want to be.

00:03:42,101 --> 00:03:43,636
Do these blocks
talk to you

00:03:43,636 --> 00:03:45,238
before or after
the cement dries?

00:03:45,238 --> 00:03:48,608
It's called "found art"
for a reason.

00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:51,211
Like, that's how I found them.

00:03:51,211 --> 00:03:52,612
Where'd you find it?

00:03:52,612 --> 00:03:56,683
Tresser Park. Dump site.

00:03:56,683 --> 00:03:58,985
Prime <i>objet</i> turf.

00:03:58,985 --> 00:04:01,120
<i>Objet?</i> What the...?
I'll translate.

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,689
You know something, pal,
you're going to come with us.

00:04:02,689 --> 00:04:03,990
And if we don't find

00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:05,992
some <i>objet</i> in Tresser Park,

00:04:05,992 --> 00:04:08,494
it's going to be
<i>"Bonjour, Bastille."</i>

00:04:08,494 --> 00:04:09,562
"Hello, prison."

Man, all this heat's
gonna ruin my spot.

00:04:51,237 --> 00:04:52,605
Our market's cutthroat.

00:04:52,605 --> 00:04:54,507
(helicopter flying over)

00:04:54,507 --> 00:04:57,277
Hey, uh, how much for
a used cop car?

00:04:57,277 --> 00:04:59,979
Maybe you got one
that's been all shot up?

00:04:59,979 --> 00:05:02,515
Give it a rest, Picasso.

00:05:04,984 --> 00:05:06,753
Is that evidence, too?

00:05:06,753 --> 00:05:10,657
This? No, that's a
perfectly good hibachi.

00:05:10,657 --> 00:05:12,158
You aren't really
thinking about

00:05:12,158 --> 00:05:13,726
taking that home
with you, are you?

00:05:13,726 --> 00:05:16,029
Hell, yes.
This'll clean up great.

00:05:16,029 --> 00:05:18,197
There's enough junk
in the world already.

00:05:18,197 --> 00:05:19,632
Why buy more?

00:05:21,801 --> 00:05:25,672
Hey, would you tag that?

00:05:25,672 --> 00:05:27,073
You need a TV, too?

00:05:27,073 --> 00:05:28,675
No, for the serial number.

00:05:28,675 --> 00:05:31,911
In case one of our
litter bugs is the killer.

00:05:31,911 --> 00:05:33,279
Or saw the killer.

00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:35,682
STOKES: Got some cement
blocks over here.

00:05:35,682 --> 00:05:37,116
Could be more
body parts.

00:05:37,116 --> 00:05:39,485
Go ahead and tag
the microwave, too.

00:05:44,691 --> 00:05:45,925
Oh, man.

00:05:47,961 --> 00:05:52,131
I think we just found
our missing face.

00:05:52,131 --> 00:05:55,034
STOKES: Early instars
of the Black Soldier Fly.

00:05:55,034 --> 00:05:56,636
Cheese Skippers.
Hide Beetles.

00:05:56,636 --> 00:05:59,706
That face has been exposed
about three weeks.

00:05:59,706 --> 00:06:01,107
RUSSELL:
Killed, cut up,

00:06:01,107 --> 00:06:03,176
encased in cement.

00:06:05,511 --> 00:06:08,014
Did you ever read
<i>The Lady in Cement?</i>

00:06:08,014 --> 00:06:10,216
What do you think?

00:06:10,216 --> 00:06:12,118
It's a great book.

00:06:12,118 --> 00:06:13,720
So-so movie.

00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,488
Frank Sinatra,
Raquel Welch.

00:06:15,488 --> 00:06:16,856
It was a Mob hit.

00:06:16,856 --> 00:06:18,825
They fitted the lady
with cement shoes,

00:06:18,825 --> 00:06:20,493
and then threw
her in the ocean.

00:06:20,493 --> 00:06:23,696
That's a good way to
dispose of the body.

00:06:25,098 --> 00:06:26,699
What do you think?

00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:30,903
Killer tosses the block,

00:06:30,903 --> 00:06:32,839
it rolls down the hill...

00:06:35,942 --> 00:06:39,078
...the block splits open,
exposes the head.

00:06:43,683 --> 00:06:45,251
Wait a second.

00:06:45,251 --> 00:06:46,786
RUSSELL:
What you got?

00:06:46,786 --> 00:06:49,088
A flower earring--
I've seen that before.

00:06:50,223 --> 00:06:52,158
Five girls were abducted,

00:06:52,158 --> 00:06:53,893
sexually assaulted and murdered,

00:06:53,893 --> 00:06:56,796
dismembered...
then encased in cement.

00:06:56,796 --> 00:06:59,198
Was it a cold case?
No, no.
We solved it.

00:06:59,198 --> 00:07:00,900
It was a husband and wife team.

00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,635
They were convicted
a couple of years ago.

00:07:02,635 --> 00:07:04,570
It was Sara's case.

00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:09,008
WOMAN (on TV):
Colleen, what do you think? Hm?

00:07:09,008 --> 00:07:10,676
I wore this just for you.

00:07:10,676 --> 00:07:12,245
You like it?

00:07:12,245 --> 00:07:14,914
I know you've been waiting
for this all day.

00:07:14,914 --> 00:07:17,216
Oh, you're such a pretty girl.

00:07:17,216 --> 00:07:18,751
(quiet laugh)

00:07:20,186 --> 00:07:22,155
SIDLE: You pulled this
from my old case files.

00:07:24,824 --> 00:07:27,093
Last sip is yours.

00:07:27,093 --> 00:07:28,628
Hmm?

00:07:34,133 --> 00:07:40,006
Say, "I want to
be a good girl."

00:07:40,006 --> 00:07:42,075
I want to be a good girl.

00:07:42,075 --> 00:07:43,543
Oh.

00:07:43,543 --> 00:07:44,710
(laughs)

00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:47,013
Good girl.

00:07:47,013 --> 00:07:48,748
MAN:
Go on, Gina.

00:07:48,748 --> 00:07:51,050
Give the good girl a reward.

00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,919
RUSSELL:
How did a woman like this

00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:54,554
not get life?

00:07:54,554 --> 00:07:57,056
Because the jury
never saw these.

00:07:57,056 --> 00:07:59,625
Gina Sinclair's husband,
Todd, hid their sex tapes

00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,094
in his grandmother's attic.

00:08:01,094 --> 00:08:03,529
We found them after she
died, but it was, uh,

00:08:03,529 --> 00:08:05,264
three weeks
after the verdict.

00:08:08,134 --> 00:08:10,736
Colleen Hughes
was their only

00:08:10,736 --> 00:08:12,972
surviving victim?

00:08:12,972 --> 00:08:16,742
They, um, held her captive
for three years.

00:08:16,742 --> 00:08:17,977
How did she walk
out of there?

00:08:17,977 --> 00:08:19,212
What did she do
differently?

00:08:19,212 --> 00:08:20,646
The psychiatrist said

00:08:20,646 --> 00:08:23,049
that Colleen was
completely compliant.

00:08:23,049 --> 00:08:27,520
She indulged their fantasies,
she never challenged them.

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,022
Most kids wouldn't be able
to get past the fear.

00:08:30,022 --> 00:08:32,825
As soon as I heard from
Nick, I called the prison.

00:08:32,825 --> 00:08:34,660
Gina got out
two months ago.

00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,095
Early release with parole.

00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:39,565
I'm not surprised.
She is a master manipulator.

00:08:39,565 --> 00:08:43,002
She sold a sob story to the jury
that her husband controlled her,

00:08:43,002 --> 00:08:45,037
that he forced her
to abuse the girls,

00:08:45,037 --> 00:08:47,640
that he threatened her life.

00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,543
Which explains why she got
five years, and he got 120.

00:08:50,543 --> 00:08:52,211
He was not the one in control.

00:08:52,211 --> 00:08:53,746
She was.

00:08:53,746 --> 00:08:55,114
So, you think
that now that she's out...

00:08:55,114 --> 00:08:56,949
She's picking up
right where she left off.

00:08:56,949 --> 00:08:58,184
Flower earrings and cement.

00:08:58,184 --> 00:09:00,653
I was on this case then.

00:09:00,653 --> 00:09:02,255
I want on it now.

00:09:02,255 --> 00:09:05,691
Well, I guess there's something
to be said for continuity.

00:09:13,032 --> 00:09:15,768
(siren approaches)

00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:21,641
Oh, if you're feeling
homesick for L.A.,

00:09:21,641 --> 00:09:22,775
this should cure you.

00:09:22,775 --> 00:09:25,011
(laughs)
Not this homesick.

00:09:25,011 --> 00:09:27,146
Listen, I'm not saying I'm
one to date guys on the job,

00:09:27,146 --> 00:09:28,648
but can I ask you
a personal question?

00:09:28,648 --> 00:09:30,183
Yeah, sure.

00:09:30,183 --> 00:09:32,151
I heard Nick was on a
date with Robbins' niece.

00:09:32,151 --> 00:09:33,252
They an item?

00:09:36,556 --> 00:09:39,091
Hey, guys.

00:09:40,726 --> 00:09:43,696
Welcome to my third
trash run of the day.

00:09:43,696 --> 00:09:46,132
In L.A., they at least
leave the underwear.

00:09:46,132 --> 00:09:48,968
Blunt force trauma,
a little blood,

00:09:48,968 --> 00:09:51,704
but no blood pool.

00:09:51,704 --> 00:09:55,508
Slight lividity on his back.

00:09:55,508 --> 00:09:58,077
But it's more prominent
in his lower extremities.

00:09:58,077 --> 00:10:00,213
No blanching on the soles
of his feet.

00:10:00,213 --> 00:10:02,248
It's weird.

00:10:02,248 --> 00:10:05,751
Guy died standing up,
but not standing on anything.

00:10:05,751 --> 00:10:07,119
Maybe he was suspended.

00:10:07,119 --> 00:10:08,254
Hung.

00:10:08,254 --> 00:10:11,257
No. No. No ligature marks.

00:10:11,257 --> 00:10:12,858
Roll him?

00:10:12,858 --> 00:10:13,993
Yeah.

00:10:13,993 --> 00:10:15,228
A little help?

00:10:15,228 --> 00:10:17,663
One, two, three.

00:10:19,065 --> 00:10:21,234
Pretty well fed
for a junkie.

00:10:23,169 --> 00:10:24,937
No jaundice.

00:10:24,937 --> 00:10:27,640
No track marks.

00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,674
Check his teeth.

00:10:28,674 --> 00:10:30,610
Nice pearlies.

00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,078
SANDERS:
Didn't brush today,

00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:34,113
but not on the pipe.

00:10:34,113 --> 00:10:35,815
BRODY: So we can forget
the trash run.

00:10:35,815 --> 00:10:38,484
He was dumped.

00:10:38,484 --> 00:10:40,486
Oh, this is good.

ROBBINS: Based on the lack of
eruption of the wisdom teeth,

00:11:41,047 --> 00:11:44,917
I'd estimate she's...
12 to 15 years old.

00:11:44,917 --> 00:11:46,819
Same age as all
the Sinclair victims.

00:11:46,819 --> 00:11:48,888
I sent her dental X-rays
to Missing Persons.

00:11:48,888 --> 00:11:50,556
Hopefully it'll
give us an I.D.

00:11:50,556 --> 00:11:53,059
Evidence of sexual assault?

00:11:53,059 --> 00:11:54,860
I found significant
vaginal trauma,

00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:57,096
possibly involving
a foreign object.

00:11:57,096 --> 00:11:59,832
Gina used to, um,
use beer bottles.

00:11:59,832 --> 00:12:02,535
I sent the SAE
kit to DNA.

00:12:02,535 --> 00:12:04,103
C.O.D.?

00:12:04,103 --> 00:12:06,138
Well, aside from the hack job,

00:12:06,138 --> 00:12:08,140
no other signs
of obvious trauma.

00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:11,210
Condition of the body makes it
hard to tell much of anything.

00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:12,812
(typing)

00:12:12,812 --> 00:12:14,513
Sinclair's previous victims were

00:12:14,513 --> 00:12:16,849
all dismembered
at the major joints.

00:12:16,849 --> 00:12:20,820
Tool marks are almost identical
to our cement girl here.

00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,589
We never did figure out what
they used to cut up the bodies.

00:12:23,589 --> 00:12:25,224
Same M.O., same tool.

00:12:25,224 --> 00:12:27,259
I don't think
we're looking at a copycat here.

00:12:27,259 --> 00:12:29,628
We know who we're looking for.

00:12:29,628 --> 00:12:31,263
WILLOWS:
Gina Sinclair.

00:12:31,263 --> 00:12:33,799
Sara's not the only one
who knows she's out of prison.

00:12:35,501 --> 00:12:36,869
RUSSELL:
Whose Web site is this?

00:12:36,869 --> 00:12:38,804
Ed Burrows.

00:12:38,804 --> 00:12:40,072
His daughter Jennifer

00:12:40,072 --> 00:12:42,241
was the Sinclairs'
second victim.

00:12:42,241 --> 00:12:44,977
This guy has quit his job,
sold his house,

00:12:44,977 --> 00:12:47,847
pretty much devoted his life to
seeing the Sinclairs put away.

00:12:47,847 --> 00:12:49,882
Somebody killed my daughter,
I'd do the same thing.

00:12:49,882 --> 00:12:51,650
And if I found out
they got out of prison,

00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:53,018
I'd have eyes on them, too.

00:12:53,018 --> 00:12:54,854
There's a lot of people
that would like to see

00:12:54,854 --> 00:12:57,256
Gina Sinclair pay
for what she did.

00:12:57,256 --> 00:13:00,192
And by people, you mean Sara.

00:13:00,192 --> 00:13:01,727
You know how it is.

00:13:01,727 --> 00:13:04,196
You, uh, live with a case
for a couple of years,

00:13:04,196 --> 00:13:05,631
you obviously get very close

00:13:05,631 --> 00:13:06,966
to the victims
and their families,

00:13:06,966 --> 00:13:09,268
and then justice
isn't served.

00:13:09,268 --> 00:13:11,637
She said she wants
another shot.

00:13:11,637 --> 00:13:13,539
Should I be worried?

00:13:13,539 --> 00:13:15,808
I know why Ecklie
brought you in.

00:13:15,808 --> 00:13:20,279
Clearly, as a supervisor,
I was too close to my team.

00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:21,714
I allowed one of them

00:13:21,714 --> 00:13:23,883
to walk into a house
with a serial killer.

00:13:23,883 --> 00:13:26,252
Right. Wh-What
are you saying?

00:13:26,252 --> 00:13:27,887
I'm saying that
you can't let Sara

00:13:27,887 --> 00:13:29,054
walk through that same door.

00:13:29,054 --> 00:13:30,623
You are the supervisor now.

00:13:30,623 --> 00:13:32,224
You've gotta
protect the team.

00:13:32,224 --> 00:13:34,093
Okay, I got that.

00:13:35,761 --> 00:13:37,696
And I appreciate
the heads up.

00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,568
Okay.

00:13:49,542 --> 00:13:50,843
(alarm chirps on)

00:13:54,713 --> 00:13:56,215
(sighs heavily)

00:14:06,859 --> 00:14:08,961
Mr. Burrows...

00:14:14,233 --> 00:14:16,001
I'm more than 200 feet
away from her place.

00:14:16,001 --> 00:14:17,269
You can check
for yourself.

00:14:17,269 --> 00:14:19,939
I'm not here about
the restraining order.

00:14:21,874 --> 00:14:25,845
I heard they found
another body.

00:14:25,845 --> 00:14:28,814
Mr. Burrows, when was
the last time you were home?

00:14:31,116 --> 00:14:33,986
My wife kicked me out
three weeks ago.

00:14:33,986 --> 00:14:36,522
I'm sorry.

00:14:36,522 --> 00:14:38,891
I, um, I've seen
your Web site.

00:14:38,891 --> 00:14:40,192
You've been busy.

00:14:42,628 --> 00:14:44,196
She's a killer.

00:14:44,196 --> 00:14:47,132
There's no way I can stand
around and do nothing.

00:14:47,132 --> 00:14:48,767
Ed, do me a favor.

00:14:48,767 --> 00:14:52,071
Go home, make up
with your wife...

00:14:52,071 --> 00:14:54,974
let us do
our job... okay?

00:15:00,112 --> 00:15:02,147
(engine starts)

00:15:09,255 --> 00:15:11,524

music playing)

00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:15,160
(laughing)

00:15:17,263 --> 00:15:19,498
WOMAN:
Gordon! Stop running!

00:15:29,842 --> 00:15:32,011
CSI Sidle, right?

00:15:32,011 --> 00:15:33,646
Mm.

00:15:33,646 --> 00:15:34,847
Care for a cold one?

00:15:34,847 --> 00:15:36,048
You look good, Gina.

00:15:36,048 --> 00:15:37,216
I guess prison
agreed with you.

00:15:39,051 --> 00:15:40,653
And you're looking
a little pale.

00:15:40,653 --> 00:15:42,788
Yeah, I spend
most of my time in a lab

00:15:42,788 --> 00:15:45,558
busting psychopaths like you.

00:15:45,558 --> 00:15:48,160
We, um... found a girl.

00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,261
In cement.

00:15:50,896 --> 00:15:52,731
That's got nothing
to do with me.

00:15:52,731 --> 00:15:55,167
Good. Then you won't mind
if I search your apartment.

00:15:55,167 --> 00:15:56,869
Well, it's kind of a mess.

00:15:56,869 --> 00:15:58,704
Maid's day off.

00:15:58,704 --> 00:16:00,105
You're on a parole.
I don't need a warrant.

00:16:00,105 --> 00:16:01,907
I don't need to be
harassed by you.

00:16:01,907 --> 00:16:04,076
Or by numbnuts out in the car.

00:16:04,076 --> 00:16:06,245
Burrows has been stalking me
ever since I got out.

00:16:06,245 --> 00:16:10,115
Well, you, um, raped, murdered
and dismembered his daughter.

00:16:10,115 --> 00:16:12,217
Court said Todd did it.

00:16:13,953 --> 00:16:16,622
I'm as much of a victim
as those other girls.

00:16:25,097 --> 00:16:26,832
Am I blocking your view?

00:16:26,832 --> 00:16:28,968
I'm just admiring the flowers.

00:16:30,269 --> 00:16:31,837
Excuse me...

00:16:31,837 --> 00:16:34,106
may I have
your attention?

00:16:34,106 --> 00:16:36,742
I am with the Las Vegas
police department.

00:16:36,742 --> 00:16:40,512
Your neighbor here,
Gina Sinclair,

00:16:40,512 --> 00:16:43,849
Apartment 206, is a
rapist and a murderer.

00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:46,585
And, if I were you,

00:16:46,585 --> 00:16:48,220
I would keep an eye
on your children.

00:16:51,557 --> 00:16:52,791
Get up.

00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:54,193
I'm calling your
parole officer.

00:16:54,193 --> 00:16:56,161
Let's see what kind of mess
your maid left.

00:17:02,234 --> 00:17:03,936
Look, I already know why
you called me in here.

00:17:03,936 --> 00:17:06,071
I paid a visit today to
a person of interest,

00:17:06,071 --> 00:17:08,507
who, by any reasonable measure,
is our prime suspect,

00:17:08,507 --> 00:17:10,075
and I executed a search.

00:17:10,075 --> 00:17:13,145
Yeah, and in the process,
in front of 30 of her neighbors,

00:17:13,145 --> 00:17:15,581
called her a rapist,
a murderer...

00:17:15,581 --> 00:17:16,715
And a psychopath.

00:17:16,715 --> 00:17:18,150
But that was to her face.

00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,485
Well, you should know

00:17:19,485 --> 00:17:21,720
that her attorney has threatened

00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,156
to sue the department and you
for harassment,

00:17:24,156 --> 00:17:26,525
which he has every right to do.

00:17:26,525 --> 00:17:28,093
(laughs)

00:17:30,162 --> 00:17:34,033
My son is on
the freshman team at WLVU.

00:17:34,033 --> 00:17:36,902
The kid's been practicing
since he was six.

00:17:36,902 --> 00:17:38,203
And you know something?

00:17:38,203 --> 00:17:40,639
In junior high,
he used to practice at night,

00:17:40,639 --> 00:17:43,108
and he wanted to walk home,
but I wouldn't let him.

00:17:43,108 --> 00:17:44,710
One of us always picked him up.

00:17:46,612 --> 00:17:49,882
Kids should be able
to walk home from school.

00:17:49,882 --> 00:17:54,620
These girls should have
been able to walk home.

00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,555
You know, I want
the Gina Sinclairs of the world

00:17:56,555 --> 00:17:58,157
off the street
just as much as you do.

00:17:58,157 --> 00:17:59,825
I was just taking
her temperature.

00:17:59,825 --> 00:18:01,894
Yeah, rectally.

00:18:01,894 --> 00:18:05,864
You showed your hand today
to a master manipulator.

00:18:05,864 --> 00:18:07,032
Your words.

00:18:07,032 --> 00:18:08,967
Her neighbors have
a right to know.

00:18:08,967 --> 00:18:11,837
She did this, five years ago,
three weeks ago,

00:18:11,837 --> 00:18:13,572
and she's gonna do it again.

00:18:13,572 --> 00:18:16,141
Yeah, and maybe now,
she'll get away with it, again.

00:18:16,141 --> 00:18:18,510
Look, you know this,
when we walk into court,

00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:20,779
if the defense can't attack
the evidence, they attack us,

00:18:20,779 --> 00:18:23,916
which is why we need to be
unbiased and impartial.

00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:25,084
You-- no--

00:18:25,084 --> 00:18:27,486
you blew it today.

00:18:27,486 --> 00:18:30,255
In front of
30 potential jurors.

00:18:30,255 --> 00:18:31,924
And I don't want
to lose this, Sara.

00:18:31,924 --> 00:18:32,925
I want to win.

00:18:32,925 --> 00:18:34,093
So do I.

00:18:36,095 --> 00:18:37,796
Am I off the case?

00:18:37,796 --> 00:18:41,734
Because, if I am, someone needs
to call Colleen Hughes

00:18:41,734 --> 00:18:43,769
and tell her
that Gina's out of prison.

00:18:45,871 --> 00:18:48,006
Maybe I should handle that.

00:18:51,744 --> 00:18:55,047
(tool whirring)

00:18:58,851 --> 00:19:02,621
Good call on the
dual livor mortis.

00:19:02,621 --> 00:19:04,223
Thank you.

00:19:04,223 --> 00:19:06,692
I didn't get this job
'cause of nepotism.

00:19:06,692 --> 00:19:09,094
Never crossed my mind.

00:19:09,094 --> 00:19:11,196
Am I late?

00:19:11,196 --> 00:19:12,564
Nope.

00:19:12,564 --> 00:19:13,966
I'm always early.

00:19:13,966 --> 00:19:15,567
You don't see
this too often.

00:19:15,567 --> 00:19:17,069
Lungs are distended.

00:19:17,069 --> 00:19:20,239
They should feel like
deflated balloons.

00:19:20,239 --> 00:19:23,242
These feel more like pillows,
but heavy.

00:19:23,242 --> 00:19:24,810
May I?

00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:26,612
Yeah.

00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,982
Oh, that's awesome.

00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:32,851
ROBBINS: Let's see
how much they weigh.

00:19:34,853 --> 00:19:36,054
Whoa!

00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,828
That looks like, uh...

00:19:42,828 --> 00:19:43,762
Chocolate.

00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,198
Guy's a soufflé.

00:19:46,198 --> 00:19:48,100
Lungs full
of chocolate,

00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,768
lividity in
the lower extremities,

00:19:49,768 --> 00:19:51,036
died vertical

00:19:51,036 --> 00:19:53,138
but not on his feet,

00:19:53,138 --> 00:19:54,540
and not hung.

00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,041
Victim was floating.

00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,944
Doc, is it possible for somebody
to drown in chocolate?

00:20:00,045 --> 00:20:03,248
So, milk
or dark chocolate?

00:20:03,248 --> 00:20:05,250
Really?
That's your first question?

00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,152
No, but it's gonna be my wife's,

00:20:07,152 --> 00:20:09,121
as soon as I tell her
this story.

00:20:09,121 --> 00:20:13,492
Well, we sent
chocolate samples to Hodges.

00:20:13,492 --> 00:20:15,994
Okay, so what's our guy weigh?

00:20:15,994 --> 00:20:19,598
221, give or take
a little fudge.

00:20:19,598 --> 00:20:21,166
How tall is he?
Five-eleven-ish.

00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:22,568
So what do you think,

00:20:22,568 --> 00:20:24,636
maybe a hundred plus gallons?

00:20:24,636 --> 00:20:26,138
SANDERS:
Well, at least.

00:20:26,138 --> 00:20:27,906
I mean, he must have
drowned in a lot of chocolate.

00:20:27,906 --> 00:20:29,808
Right, so--
Oh, you guys,

00:20:29,808 --> 00:20:32,945
there's this great book
you'd love.

00:20:32,945 --> 00:20:37,749
Uh, <i>Road to Wellville</i>
by T.C. Boyle.

00:20:37,749 --> 00:20:40,686
There's a part where a man
kills his adopted son

00:20:40,686 --> 00:20:44,556
by drowning him in a vat
of macadamia nut butter.

00:20:46,191 --> 00:20:47,759
All right, well,
I guess we should...

00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:48,927
Find the vat.

00:20:48,927 --> 00:20:50,562
Yeah, that's probably
a good idea.

00:20:50,562 --> 00:20:51,763
Thanks.

00:20:59,705 --> 00:21:02,608
Okay... Ryan Thomas?

00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:14,152
You know that dumping's illegal,

00:21:14,152 --> 00:21:16,722
right, Mr. Thomas?

00:21:16,722 --> 00:21:19,925
It's an $800 fine.

00:21:19,925 --> 00:21:21,627
It was just a busted microwave.

00:21:21,627 --> 00:21:25,097
I mean, it doesn't even...
microwave anymore.

00:21:25,097 --> 00:21:26,999
Is that what you do
with all your old stuff?

00:21:26,999 --> 00:21:28,934
You just dump it in the ravine
at Tresser Park?

00:21:28,934 --> 00:21:30,269
I'm sorry, man.

00:21:30,269 --> 00:21:32,504
It costs money
to dump at the dump.

00:21:32,504 --> 00:21:34,506
You throw anything else
in that ravine?

00:21:34,506 --> 00:21:35,841
No.

00:21:35,841 --> 00:21:37,242
I mean, why are
you sweating me?

00:21:37,242 --> 00:21:39,544
It's not like I dumped
a body or something.

00:21:39,544 --> 00:21:40,746
Somebody did.

00:21:40,746 --> 00:21:42,848
And your junk
was right on top.

00:21:42,848 --> 00:21:44,816
When'd you dump the microwave?

00:21:44,816 --> 00:21:47,986
I don't know, about...

00:21:47,986 --> 00:21:49,621
three weeks ago.

00:21:49,621 --> 00:21:52,524
Did you see anybody else
in the park that night?

00:21:52,524 --> 00:21:55,227
There was a truck.

00:21:55,227 --> 00:21:57,195
And it... peeled out.

00:21:57,195 --> 00:21:58,563
Damn near hit me.

00:21:58,563 --> 00:22:02,034
Did it look like...

00:22:02,034 --> 00:22:03,702
that?

00:22:03,702 --> 00:22:04,836
Maybe...

00:22:04,836 --> 00:22:07,205
Yeah.

00:22:07,205 --> 00:22:08,573
A chick was driving it.

00:22:08,573 --> 00:22:10,242
She was hot.

00:22:10,242 --> 00:22:12,778
Look, man, take my
prints, my... my DNA.

00:22:12,778 --> 00:22:14,680
I-I-I got to get
back to work.

00:22:19,184 --> 00:22:20,752
There you are.

00:22:20,752 --> 00:22:22,154
But I just had a Coke.

00:22:22,154 --> 00:22:23,755
Enjoy.

00:22:23,755 --> 00:22:26,158
I can't believe
they let her out.

00:22:27,993 --> 00:22:29,828
Where is she?

00:22:29,828 --> 00:22:32,064
Under the conditions
of her parole,

00:22:32,064 --> 00:22:34,099
she has to
stay in Vegas.

00:22:36,635 --> 00:22:38,837
Of course she does.

00:22:38,837 --> 00:22:41,807
So what, now she's free
and I have to hide?

00:22:41,807 --> 00:22:44,076
No. No. No one says
you have to hide.

00:22:44,076 --> 00:22:45,877
But maybe you
should move

00:22:45,877 --> 00:22:48,880
back in with your parents,
just for a while.

00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,216
No way.

00:22:51,216 --> 00:22:53,118
Do you have any idea
what it's like

00:22:53,118 --> 00:22:55,153
to live with parents
who thought that you were dead?

00:22:56,822 --> 00:22:59,091
Do you have any friends
you can stay with?

00:22:59,091 --> 00:23:01,860
I don't have any friends
because I don't trust anyone.

00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:04,162
The shrinks
call it PTSD.

00:23:05,864 --> 00:23:08,066
I say, once you've been
chained to a bed and raped

00:23:08,066 --> 00:23:11,670
for 1,112 days...

00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:13,672
it's better to be alone.

00:23:21,013 --> 00:23:23,148
Okay. Um...

00:23:23,148 --> 00:23:26,752
I-I'll try to arrange
for some police protection.

00:23:26,752 --> 00:23:28,720
No.

00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,523
Why don't you send the cops
to her place?

00:23:31,523 --> 00:23:33,792
I can take care
of myself.

00:23:35,494 --> 00:23:38,063
I'm done being a victim.

00:23:40,532 --> 00:23:42,534
All right. Um...

00:23:42,534 --> 00:23:45,203
this has the number to the
department on the front,

00:23:45,203 --> 00:23:47,539
but that's my cell
phone on the back.

00:23:47,539 --> 00:23:49,007
I want you
to call me.

00:23:49,007 --> 00:23:52,978
Colleen, I want you to
call me anytime you want.

00:24:02,554 --> 00:24:04,589
WILLOWS:
Samantha Chase, 13.

00:24:04,589 --> 00:24:06,158
Our girl in cement.

00:24:06,158 --> 00:24:10,128
Doc Robbins I.D.'d her
off of her dental records.

00:24:10,128 --> 00:24:13,031
She was last seen
three weeks ago

00:24:13,031 --> 00:24:14,699
leaving Desert
Palm Library.

00:24:14,699 --> 00:24:16,001
Library is here.

00:24:16,001 --> 00:24:18,203
Samantha Chase's
home is here.

00:24:18,203 --> 00:24:21,740
And Gina Sinclair's condo
is right in the middle.

00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,775
We know that...

00:24:23,775 --> 00:24:25,710
both of her parents work.

00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:27,079
Latchkey kid.

00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:28,613
She walks home from
the library every day,

00:24:28,613 --> 00:24:30,582
right past Gina's window.

00:24:30,582 --> 00:24:31,750
Same age.

00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:32,951
Even looks like
the previous victims.

00:24:32,951 --> 00:24:34,519
Gina's a predator.

00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:35,620
She probably waited
for the right moment,

00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,089
and then she just
grabbed her.

00:24:37,089 --> 00:24:38,623
Yeah, but you said
you searched Gina's place.

00:24:38,623 --> 00:24:40,258
Yes, and I didn't
find anything,

00:24:40,258 --> 00:24:42,094
but that doesn't mean she didn't
take her somewhere else.

00:24:42,094 --> 00:24:43,562
Well, we need to find
that someplace else.

00:24:43,562 --> 00:24:44,663
RUSSELL:
And until we do,
(phone ringing)

00:24:44,663 --> 00:24:46,031
that's just a theory.

00:24:48,266 --> 00:24:49,801
A theory.

00:24:49,801 --> 00:24:51,970
Trace results
from Samantha Chase's

00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:53,505
fingernail scrapings--
found dog hair.

00:24:53,505 --> 00:24:54,873
Pomeranian.

00:24:54,873 --> 00:24:57,042
Gina Sinclair has a Pomeranian.

00:25:07,886 --> 00:25:11,223
This guy looks good
from every angle.

00:25:12,691 --> 00:25:14,960
If he's selling,
I'm buying.

00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,163
I'm not so sure it's
chocolate he's selling.

00:25:18,163 --> 00:25:21,800
Some studies suggest women
prefer chocolate to sex.

00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,935
I say,
why not have both?

00:25:23,935 --> 00:25:26,138
Angie Salinger, CEO,

00:25:26,138 --> 00:25:27,739
Sinful Pleasures.

00:25:27,739 --> 00:25:29,174
I really like your ad campaign.

00:25:29,174 --> 00:25:30,842
And we're
investigating a guy

00:25:30,842 --> 00:25:33,145
who really liked
your chocolate.

00:25:33,145 --> 00:25:35,147
You recognize this guy?

00:25:35,147 --> 00:25:37,649
Uh, yes. He came into
the factory a few days ago,

00:25:37,649 --> 00:25:38,917
looking for a job.

00:25:38,917 --> 00:25:40,552
Do you remember his name?

00:25:40,552 --> 00:25:43,622
No, but I can have HR
look him up.

00:25:43,622 --> 00:25:45,524
Is he dead?

00:25:45,524 --> 00:25:48,593
We believe
that your chocolate was...

00:25:48,593 --> 00:25:49,928
Involved.

00:25:49,928 --> 00:25:51,763
This guy died
from eating my chocolate?

00:25:51,763 --> 00:25:53,965
More like inhaling it.

00:25:53,965 --> 00:25:55,667
According to our
chemical analysis,

00:25:55,667 --> 00:25:59,004
it was your Argentinean Virgin
Honey Bee chocolate.

00:25:59,004 --> 00:26:01,573
We're going to need
to take a tour

00:26:01,573 --> 00:26:03,542
of your chocolate factory.

00:26:19,691 --> 00:26:21,793
Oh, wow.

00:26:21,793 --> 00:26:25,096
Floral hints of honey,
combined with cocoa.

00:26:25,096 --> 00:26:27,832
That's intense.

00:26:27,832 --> 00:26:29,167
If I fall in, don't save me.

00:26:29,167 --> 00:26:31,102
SANDERS:
Copy that.

00:26:31,102 --> 00:26:33,171
Hey, while you're up there,
notice if anyone else fell in?

00:26:44,182 --> 00:26:46,651
I'm thinking pube recall.

00:26:46,651 --> 00:26:49,588
Well, looks like we found
our primary.

00:26:49,588 --> 00:26:52,224
If John Doe drowned in this vat,

00:26:52,224 --> 00:26:54,226
then by definition,

00:26:54,226 --> 00:26:55,927
he didn't climb out.
Oh, he had help.

00:26:57,796 --> 00:26:59,598
<i>Six-foot drop.</i>

00:26:59,598 --> 00:27:01,666
<i>Explains the postmortem BFT</i>
<i>to the head.</i>

00:27:03,201 --> 00:27:05,570
BRODY:
<i>Guy covered in chocolate--</i>

00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:06,905
<i>that's gonna make a mess.</i>

00:27:06,905 --> 00:27:08,873
Somebody cleaned up.

00:27:08,873 --> 00:27:10,709
Gave this place

00:27:10,709 --> 00:27:13,078
and our John Doe
a bath.

00:27:21,686 --> 00:27:23,221
Oh.

00:27:24,623 --> 00:27:26,591
Piece of scalp.

00:27:28,026 --> 00:27:29,261
SANDERS:
Shut it down.

00:27:29,261 --> 00:27:30,996
This place is
a crime scene.

00:27:40,205 --> 00:27:42,741
You wanted to see me?

00:27:42,741 --> 00:27:44,609
Did you process
these blocks?

00:27:44,609 --> 00:27:45,944
Yes.

00:27:45,944 --> 00:27:47,112
By yourself?

00:27:47,112 --> 00:27:48,780
No, I worked with Nick.

00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,148
Why, is there a problem or...?

00:27:50,148 --> 00:27:52,651
These blocks are heavy.

00:27:52,651 --> 00:27:55,553
Not surprising it's
a two-person job.

00:27:59,157 --> 00:28:01,159
Gina had help.

00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:03,128
Like before.

00:28:03,128 --> 00:28:06,097
I don't think
she's a solo act.

00:28:06,097 --> 00:28:07,666
She found another Todd--

00:28:07,666 --> 00:28:10,769
somebody weak,
someone easily controlled.

00:28:10,769 --> 00:28:12,137
Find the weak link,

00:28:12,137 --> 00:28:14,205
nail Gina.

00:28:19,944 --> 00:28:21,880
(moans)

00:28:23,481 --> 00:28:24,949
Is that your lunch?

00:28:24,949 --> 00:28:26,184
Yeah.

00:28:27,952 --> 00:28:31,523
I thought you guys said
you found pubes in the cocoa.

00:28:31,523 --> 00:28:33,158
No, this is pre-pube.

00:28:33,158 --> 00:28:34,659
Oh.

00:28:34,659 --> 00:28:37,729
You should try this.

00:28:37,729 --> 00:28:40,598
Dark chocolate infused
with pasilla chili,

00:28:40,598 --> 00:28:42,634
cayenne pepper, and cinnamon.

00:28:42,634 --> 00:28:45,637
Oh, no, I've already got
some chili, thanks.

00:28:45,637 --> 00:28:47,872
So, did you get an I.D.
on your victim yet--

00:28:47,872 --> 00:28:49,174
the, uh, truffle guy?

00:28:49,174 --> 00:28:50,608
Mm. Yeah.

00:28:50,608 --> 00:28:53,878
25, local.

00:28:53,878 --> 00:28:56,114
Greg and I searched his place.

00:28:56,114 --> 00:28:58,950
Mm... sorry. Sticky.

00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:01,052
Guy was drowning
in chocolate.

00:29:01,052 --> 00:29:03,955
Well, before he was
drowning in chocolate.

00:29:03,955 --> 00:29:06,491
Could be why he was hitting up
Sinful Pleasures for a job.

00:29:06,491 --> 00:29:08,860
You know what they say
about loving your work.

00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,628
Yeah.
SANDERS:
Hey.

00:29:10,628 --> 00:29:12,597
I love my work, too.

00:29:12,597 --> 00:29:15,867
So chocolate wasn't
Chad's only obsession.

00:29:15,867 --> 00:29:19,104
Archie unlocked
Chad's laptop.

00:29:19,104 --> 00:29:21,072
That's the hot bod
from the ad campaign.

00:29:21,072 --> 00:29:22,874
Now, Chad has

00:29:22,874 --> 00:29:26,111
over a thousand images of
"hot bod" on his photo file.

00:29:26,111 --> 00:29:27,178
Check this out.

00:29:27,178 --> 00:29:30,215
His eyes
are amber.

00:29:32,784 --> 00:29:34,552
BRODY:
Victim's eyes are amber.

00:29:34,552 --> 00:29:36,020
STOKES:
Well, in order

00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,956
to get amber eyes,
you need two recessive genes,

00:29:37,956 --> 00:29:40,024
one from Mom, one from Dad.

00:29:40,024 --> 00:29:42,560
Typically found in less than
one percent of the population.

00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,028
One in a hundred shot.

00:29:44,028 --> 00:29:45,029
Try one in one.

00:29:45,029 --> 00:29:47,098
Pull up his old DMV photo.

00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,869
BRODY:
Wow, it's the same guy.

00:29:50,869 --> 00:29:52,103
SANDERS:
Just more of him.

00:29:52,103 --> 00:29:54,639
That's really depressing.

00:29:54,639 --> 00:29:55,907
Gained a hundred pounds,

00:29:55,907 --> 00:29:57,242
lost his looks.

00:29:57,242 --> 00:29:58,910
Lost more than that.

00:30:02,213 --> 00:30:04,949
SANDERS:
You lied to us when you said
you didn't know Chad Ellis.

00:30:04,949 --> 00:30:07,152
I don't.

00:30:07,152 --> 00:30:09,854
He came into the factory looking
for a job-- end of story.

00:30:09,854 --> 00:30:11,055
Well, his photos

00:30:11,055 --> 00:30:12,991
are all over your factory.

00:30:12,991 --> 00:30:15,827
That's Tristan Duran.

00:30:15,827 --> 00:30:18,029
Now, him, I know--

00:30:18,029 --> 00:30:19,264
every inch.

00:30:19,264 --> 00:30:21,099
BRODY: Then you can
confirm the birthmark

00:30:21,099 --> 00:30:22,734
on his left butt cheek--

00:30:22,734 --> 00:30:24,269
the one in the shape
of Rhode Island?

00:30:24,269 --> 00:30:25,904
Absolutely.

00:30:25,904 --> 00:30:28,773
Well, Chad Ellis has
a birthmark, too,

00:30:28,773 --> 00:30:31,176
only now it's the size of Texas.

00:30:32,811 --> 00:30:34,646
When did you guys stop seeing
each other?

00:30:34,646 --> 00:30:36,581
It was a fling.

00:30:36,581 --> 00:30:37,916
He moved on,
I moved on.

00:30:37,916 --> 00:30:39,083
Heard he was walking
runways in Milan.

00:30:39,083 --> 00:30:40,685
SANDERS:
Well, apparently,

00:30:40,685 --> 00:30:43,922
he didn't walk them too long.

00:30:43,922 --> 00:30:46,724
Just like your ad,
he dipped into the chocolate.

00:30:46,724 --> 00:30:48,193
Ate himself out of a career.

00:30:48,193 --> 00:30:50,695
Broke, modeling days are over,

00:30:50,695 --> 00:30:53,898
he came to you for a job;
any job.

00:30:53,898 --> 00:30:56,067
I didn't know
it was Tristan, I swear.

00:30:56,067 --> 00:30:57,268
SANDERS:
I think you did.

00:30:57,268 --> 00:30:58,603
After all, he drowned

00:30:58,603 --> 00:31:00,104
in your chocolate,

00:31:00,104 --> 00:31:01,973
which means he had to make it
past your security.

00:31:01,973 --> 00:31:03,575
And somebody had

00:31:03,575 --> 00:31:05,109
to fish him out of the
vat and clean him up

00:31:05,109 --> 00:31:07,178
and dump him in an alley.

00:31:10,148 --> 00:31:12,083
Okay.

00:31:12,083 --> 00:31:14,652
We're done here.

00:31:14,652 --> 00:31:15,954
We'll let the jury decide.

00:31:15,954 --> 00:31:18,690
I didn't kill the guy.

00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:19,924
Then who did?

00:31:19,924 --> 00:31:22,193
He killed himself.

00:31:23,695 --> 00:31:28,166
Tristan, Chad, whatever-- he...

00:31:28,166 --> 00:31:30,602
he came into the factory
after hours,

00:31:30,602 --> 00:31:32,070
<i>told my security guy he used</i>

00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:34,038
<i>to work there--</i>
<i>happiest days of his life--</i>

00:31:34,038 --> 00:31:36,908
<i>paid him off, and told him</i>
<i>that he needed some alone time.</i>

00:31:36,908 --> 00:31:39,143
<i>He said he was moving on,</i>
<i>wanted to say good-bye.</i>

00:31:39,143 --> 00:31:41,546
SANDERS:
<i>Well, he sure did.</i>

00:31:53,858 --> 00:31:55,927
How come
you didn't call the cops?

00:31:57,262 --> 00:32:00,265
Each of those vats
is worth $20,000.

00:32:00,265 --> 00:32:02,567
I call you guys
and I'm out of business.

00:32:02,567 --> 00:32:04,569
So you cleaned him up
and dumped him in an alley?

00:32:04,569 --> 00:32:06,070
I didn't.

00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:09,274
My security guy did for
an extra 50 bucks and his job.

00:32:09,274 --> 00:32:13,611
It's not a crime;
he killed himself.

00:32:13,611 --> 00:32:16,748
Suicide... by chocolate.

00:32:16,748 --> 00:32:21,152
Dumping a body is
a Class-D felony.

00:32:21,152 --> 00:32:25,023
And making false statements
to the police--

00:32:25,023 --> 00:32:26,724
that's the whipped cream
on the sundae.

00:32:26,724 --> 00:32:27,759
Or...

00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:29,694
another year on the nickel.

00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:34,899
MRS. HUGHES:
<i>I'm here because I'm worried</i>
<i>about Colleen.</i>

00:32:34,899 --> 00:32:37,669
I called the café, she
didn't show up for work,

00:32:37,669 --> 00:32:40,238
so I-I went over to her house,

00:32:40,238 --> 00:32:42,807
and that's when I found this.

00:32:42,807 --> 00:32:45,043
What's going on?

00:32:45,043 --> 00:32:47,545
Mrs. Hughes, I contacted
your daughter to let her know

00:32:47,545 --> 00:32:51,516
that Gina Sinclair had been
released from prison.

00:32:51,516 --> 00:32:52,984
(sighing):
Oh.

00:32:52,984 --> 00:32:55,253
Is, is Colleen in
police protection?

00:32:58,256 --> 00:32:59,757
Sara...

00:32:59,757 --> 00:33:01,492
Supervisor Russell

00:33:01,492 --> 00:33:04,963
offered Colleen protection,
but she declined.

00:33:06,831 --> 00:33:08,833
I could feel it.

00:33:08,833 --> 00:33:10,768
I knew something was wrong.

00:33:13,104 --> 00:33:15,773
It's happening again.

00:33:15,773 --> 00:33:17,709
She has her.

00:33:26,217 --> 00:33:28,086
Burrows' car.

00:33:28,086 --> 00:33:29,253
No Burrows.

00:33:29,253 --> 00:33:31,990
Control, Charlie
Zero-One-Russell.

00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:34,058
Requesting immediate backup

00:33:34,058 --> 00:33:36,260
<i>at Gina Sinclair's apartment.</i>

00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:38,529
BURROWS: You took the
best thing from me!

00:33:38,529 --> 00:33:40,932
GINA:
Stop...!

00:33:40,932 --> 00:33:42,133
BURROWS:
Look at me!

00:33:42,133 --> 00:33:43,201
Look at me!
GINA: No!

00:33:43,201 --> 00:33:44,168
I'm gonna kill you.
Ed?

00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:46,971
GINA:
Help me!

00:33:46,971 --> 00:33:48,873
Don't you look
away from me!

00:33:48,873 --> 00:33:50,008
Ed, drop the knife!

00:33:50,008 --> 00:33:51,109
Ed, listen to me.

00:33:51,109 --> 00:33:52,610
Listen to me.
Shoot him!

00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:54,178
BURROWS: You did this.
You did this!

00:33:54,178 --> 00:33:55,580
You're not gonna get your
daughter back this way.

00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:56,814
You do this, she wins.

00:33:56,814 --> 00:33:58,082
Come on, put it down.

00:33:58,082 --> 00:33:59,984
She cut my little
Jenny into pieces.

00:33:59,984 --> 00:34:01,686
Just shoot him.
(gun cocking)

00:34:01,686 --> 00:34:04,956
Put the knife down,
or I'll shoot.

00:34:04,956 --> 00:34:06,691
We're all right.
We're gonna be all right here.

00:34:06,691 --> 00:34:07,925
We're gonna be all right.
SIDLE:
Ed?

00:34:07,925 --> 00:34:10,762
Colleen Hughes
is missing, okay?

00:34:10,762 --> 00:34:15,500
And Gina is the only person
who knows where she is.

00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,801
We need to find
Colleen, okay?

00:34:16,801 --> 00:34:18,670
We need you to put
the knife down.

00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:20,204
(sighs)

00:34:20,204 --> 00:34:22,273
SIDLE:
Ed, Ed, please!

00:34:23,875 --> 00:34:24,809
Please.

00:34:30,048 --> 00:34:31,249
RUSSELL:
There you go, buddy.

00:34:36,254 --> 00:34:38,856
(sobbing deeply)

00:34:42,927 --> 00:34:44,095
Thank you.

00:35:01,546 --> 00:35:03,281
Fire in the hole!

00:35:05,917 --> 00:35:08,753
(hissing)

00:35:35,747 --> 00:35:37,749
You okay, Sara?

00:35:37,749 --> 00:35:41,185
I heard it got pretty
ugly over at Gina's.

00:35:41,185 --> 00:35:43,688
Well, the good news is,
she's in the hospital.

00:35:43,688 --> 00:35:45,690
Bad news is,
she's going to be okay.

00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:48,593
And we still have no idea
where they're holding Colleen.

00:35:48,593 --> 00:35:50,661
Ed Burrows is
facing kidnapping,

00:35:50,661 --> 00:35:53,664
assault with a deadly weapon
and attempted murder charges.

00:35:53,664 --> 00:35:56,200
Once again, Gina skates.

00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,870
Well, maybe not this time.

00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:02,240
Hodges found traces
of sodium metasilicate

00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,876
and anionic surfactant

00:36:04,876 --> 00:36:06,277
on cement girl's
body parts.

00:36:06,277 --> 00:36:07,612
Soap?

00:36:07,612 --> 00:36:09,013
Not just any soap.

00:36:09,013 --> 00:36:11,883
Soap that's used
in industrial pressure washers,

00:36:11,883 --> 00:36:13,584
which got me thinking.

00:36:13,584 --> 00:36:15,620
We never found the tool
that was used

00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,088
to cut up the Sinclairs'
victims, right?

00:36:17,088 --> 00:36:18,589
Uh-uh.

00:36:18,589 --> 00:36:20,191
So, I got one
of those power washers,

00:36:20,191 --> 00:36:22,059
and used it on a pork shank.

00:36:22,059 --> 00:36:23,895
And the traumatic injuries
were consistent.

00:36:23,895 --> 00:36:25,563
Those things are no joke.

00:36:25,563 --> 00:36:28,666
So, Gina used a pressure
washer to dismember the bodies?

00:36:28,666 --> 00:36:30,802
But you know,
we never found

00:36:30,802 --> 00:36:32,804
any trace of soap
in the original case.

00:36:32,804 --> 00:36:35,173
'Cause I don't think
she used it.

00:36:35,173 --> 00:36:36,774
I think that was Todd's job.

00:36:36,774 --> 00:36:38,810
Todd knew to rinse off the soap.

00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:40,511
Gina missed that step.

00:36:40,511 --> 00:36:42,613
Or whoever
she's teamed up with now.

00:36:42,613 --> 00:36:44,615
So Gina has access
to a pressure washer.

00:36:44,615 --> 00:36:45,950
Yeah, I think so.

00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:48,119
A big, fat, industrial one--
a $50,000 unit.

00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:50,822
There's not a lot of those
floating around.

00:36:57,862 --> 00:36:59,163
Yeah, come here.

00:36:59,163 --> 00:37:02,667
I love DNA.

00:37:02,667 --> 00:37:05,203
I like Tox, too, but this new
DNA gig-- it's like...

00:37:05,203 --> 00:37:06,671
Yeah, Henry, you tapped.

00:37:06,671 --> 00:37:08,172
Yes, I did, and...

00:37:08,172 --> 00:37:10,208
I think I hit a grand slam.
What do you got?

00:37:10,208 --> 00:37:13,144
I examined the SAE kit
on Samantha Chase--

00:37:13,144 --> 00:37:14,745
the Lady in Cement.

00:37:14,745 --> 00:37:15,847
Mm.
Found semen

00:37:15,847 --> 00:37:17,748
on the vaginal swab,
which I ran

00:37:17,748 --> 00:37:19,684
on my first post-qualification
DNA batch.

00:37:19,684 --> 00:37:21,719
All right, but why are you
handing me the results

00:37:21,719 --> 00:37:23,855
of the entire 96 sample run?

00:37:23,855 --> 00:37:25,156
Because I happened to notice

00:37:25,156 --> 00:37:27,558
that two of the samples
were the same DNA.

00:37:27,558 --> 00:37:28,726
A match.

00:37:28,726 --> 00:37:30,761
Samantha Chase
and Number 26.

00:37:30,761 --> 00:37:32,530
26. Ryan Thomas.

00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:34,165
Ryan Thomas.

00:37:34,165 --> 00:37:36,234
He's the guy who threw the
microwave down the ravine.

00:37:36,234 --> 00:37:38,135
All I know is,
it was his semen.

00:37:38,135 --> 00:37:40,605
He had relations
with the Lady in Cement.

00:37:40,605 --> 00:37:43,741
Henry, home run, buddy.

00:37:43,741 --> 00:37:45,676
Ryan Thomas partnered up
with Gina.

00:37:45,676 --> 00:37:47,511
They tortured and
murdered Samantha Chase,

00:37:47,511 --> 00:37:49,046
and now they've
got Colleen Hughes.

00:37:49,046 --> 00:37:50,581
Oh, man, I had him.

00:37:50,581 --> 00:37:52,083
Yeah, he was sitting
right across from me.

00:37:52,083 --> 00:37:53,951
(phone ringing)
We still got him, Nick.

00:37:53,951 --> 00:37:55,086
You swabbed his cheek,

00:37:55,086 --> 00:37:56,787
and you took his info.

00:37:56,787 --> 00:37:58,823
All right, Brass
checked out Thomas' place.

00:37:58,823 --> 00:38:00,091
He wasn't there.

00:38:00,091 --> 00:38:01,626
We have a broadcast
out on the van.

00:38:01,626 --> 00:38:03,094
So where did Thomas work?

00:38:03,094 --> 00:38:05,096
He was a day laborer.

00:38:05,096 --> 00:38:06,264
Construction, odd jobs.

00:38:06,264 --> 00:38:07,665
Stuff like that.

00:38:07,665 --> 00:38:09,100
Last employment
was at a marina.

00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,735
WILLOWS:
Hodges ran

00:38:10,735 --> 00:38:12,803
the fibers that you pulled
from the cement blocks.

00:38:12,803 --> 00:38:14,272
Said it was fiberglass.

00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:16,240
The type used
in auto body repair,

00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,608
as well as boats.

00:38:17,608 --> 00:38:18,943
RUSSELL:
You know, in Seattle,

00:38:18,943 --> 00:38:20,144
when we take a boat
out for the winter,

00:38:20,144 --> 00:38:21,679
you know what we do?

00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:23,915
Power wash it.

00:38:23,915 --> 00:38:25,683
WILLOWS:
So what

00:38:25,683 --> 00:38:27,818
marina employed Ryan Thomas?

00:38:35,259 --> 00:38:36,794
There's a warehouse
around the back.

00:38:36,794 --> 00:38:38,562
Looks abandoned.
Pop it.

00:38:51,542 --> 00:38:53,544
(dog yapping)

00:39:00,051 --> 00:39:01,519
WOMAN:
No, don't cry.

00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:02,987
You want to be
a good girl, don't you?

00:39:02,987 --> 00:39:04,755
Come on, say it.
"I want to be a good girl."

00:39:04,755 --> 00:39:08,159
Say it. Say, "I want
to be a good girl."

00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:09,894
Last sip is yours.

00:39:09,894 --> 00:39:11,128
No, don't cry.

00:39:11,128 --> 00:39:13,931
Say, "I want
to be a good girl."

00:39:13,931 --> 00:39:15,166
Say it.

00:39:15,166 --> 00:39:16,567
I want to be
a good girl.

00:39:20,204 --> 00:39:21,505
MITCHELL: Police!
On the ground, now!

00:39:21,505 --> 00:39:23,040
Help me!

00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,677
Don't you move!
Don't you move!

00:39:26,677 --> 00:39:29,046
Don't move. Don't move.
Secure that man.

00:39:29,046 --> 00:39:31,148
COLLEEN: (panting)
No. no.

00:39:31,148 --> 00:39:32,984
No! Stop it!
Don't touch me!

00:39:32,984 --> 00:39:35,219
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be all right.

00:39:35,219 --> 00:39:36,520
(panting)

00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,888
Colleen?

00:39:37,888 --> 00:39:40,624
I just wanted
to give Gina another flower.

00:39:40,624 --> 00:39:42,093
I'm a good girl.

00:39:42,093 --> 00:39:45,663
I'm a good girl.

00:39:45,663 --> 00:39:48,199
STOKES: I'm not gonna
let anybody else hurt you.

00:39:48,199 --> 00:39:49,533
It's all right.

00:39:49,533 --> 00:39:51,135
It's over.

00:40:11,188 --> 00:40:13,057
(sighs)

00:40:14,892 --> 00:40:17,094
The doctor says, uh,

00:40:17,094 --> 00:40:21,665
victims sometimes identify
with their abusers.

00:40:21,665 --> 00:40:24,702
Colleen is who she is

00:40:24,702 --> 00:40:28,005
because of what Gina
Sinclair did to her.

00:40:28,005 --> 00:40:32,777
Colleen was at a... a critical
age when she was abducted.

00:40:32,777 --> 00:40:36,747
She was still developing some
key aspects of her personality.

00:40:36,747 --> 00:40:41,585
I thought it was a miracle...

00:40:41,585 --> 00:40:44,789
a gift that she survived.

00:40:44,789 --> 00:40:46,757
And now...

00:40:46,757 --> 00:40:48,692
(sighs)

00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:58,602
How do I protect her

00:40:58,602 --> 00:41:00,871
from herself?

00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:03,808
(crying)

00:41:25,763 --> 00:41:28,265
Hey.

00:41:28,265 --> 00:41:29,900
Hey.

00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,635
(taps seat)

00:41:38,542 --> 00:41:41,145
(sighs)

00:41:41,145 --> 00:41:43,180
Have you eaten?

00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:45,816
You know, I'm not
really in the mood.

00:41:45,816 --> 00:41:47,985
Yeah, I'm hungry, too.

00:41:47,985 --> 00:41:49,854
You like Chinese?

00:41:52,189 --> 00:41:54,125
Sushi?

00:41:54,125 --> 00:41:56,794
Italian?

00:41:56,794 --> 00:41:59,663
Greek?

00:41:59,663 --> 00:42:01,065
I will go on.

00:42:01,065 --> 00:42:03,868
Oh, I-I know you will.

00:42:07,071 --> 00:42:09,540
Do you like Indian?
