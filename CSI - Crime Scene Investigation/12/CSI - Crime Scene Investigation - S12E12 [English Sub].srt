00:00:01,281 --> 00:00:04,261
<i>Previously on</i> CSI...
I talked to that lawyer--
he's arranging a meeting

00:00:04,261 --> 00:00:05,663
with the FBI.

00:00:05,663 --> 00:00:07,298
I haven't seen Laura
in two weeks,

00:00:07,298 --> 00:00:08,666
since she talked to the
lawyer <i>you</i> sent her to.

00:00:08,666 --> 00:00:10,034
SIDLE:
<i>The hit was professional.</i>

00:00:10,034 --> 00:00:11,402
<i>Clean-up was professional, too.</i>

00:00:11,402 --> 00:00:13,404
You remember Special Agents
Pratt and McQuaid?

00:00:13,404 --> 00:00:14,705
I'll be with her
the whole time.

00:00:14,705 --> 00:00:16,407
WILLOWS:
<i>You got my friend killed!</i>

00:00:16,407 --> 00:00:18,342
How could you
let this happen?

00:00:18,342 --> 00:00:20,077
(automatic gunfire)

00:00:20,077 --> 00:00:21,312
Get in.

00:00:43,667 --> 00:00:45,436
Hey, Russell...

00:00:48,639 --> 00:00:51,609
(keypad beeping)

00:00:51,609 --> 00:00:53,144
Hey, D.B., it's Nick.

00:00:53,144 --> 00:00:55,379
Listen, I got a lead
on the money trail

00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:57,982
from Mark Gabriel's company
to his hit squad

00:00:57,982 --> 00:00:59,650
via the Swiss bank account.

00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:03,587
So, you need to call me back
so I can fill you in, all right?

00:01:03,587 --> 00:01:05,489
(beeps)
Hey, Sara.

00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:08,459
You seen Catherine?
No. You probably
won't for a few days.

00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:09,994
What do you mean?
You haven't heard?

00:01:09,994 --> 00:01:11,395
Heard what?
Laura Gabriel
was murdered

00:01:11,395 --> 00:01:12,496
in FBI custody.

00:01:12,496 --> 00:01:14,031
Well, how'd that happen?

00:01:14,031 --> 00:01:15,199
One of Mark Gabriel's
hit squad infiltrated

00:01:15,199 --> 00:01:16,500
the protection detail.

00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,169
McQuaid and three
other agents were killed.

00:01:18,169 --> 00:01:20,504
Catherine went off on
Agent Pratt at the crime scene,

00:01:20,504 --> 00:01:23,407
and Russell sent
her home to cool off.
Yeah, where is Russell?

00:01:23,407 --> 00:01:27,211
(phone rings)
Call out, downtown motel-- I saw
him hightail it out of here.

00:01:27,211 --> 00:01:29,246
Stokes.

00:01:29,246 --> 00:01:30,681
Yeah, yeah, we're looking
for him right now.

00:01:30,681 --> 00:01:32,082
Okay, we'll handle it.

00:01:32,082 --> 00:01:34,118
What now?
Got a 434,

00:01:34,118 --> 00:01:36,053
shots fired at the corner
of Jupiter and Fairwick.

00:01:36,053 --> 00:01:37,621
20 minutes ago.

00:01:37,621 --> 00:01:40,758
Southern Highlands?
That's Catherine's neighborhood.

00:01:40,758 --> 00:01:44,128
I got a bad feeling
about this.

00:01:44,128 --> 00:01:47,131
(siren whooping)

00:01:47,131 --> 00:01:48,732
Hey.

00:01:48,732 --> 00:01:50,501
Why'd you guys call me over
to Catherine's house?

00:01:50,501 --> 00:01:52,403
434 is five blocks that way.

00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:55,072
We've been trying to reach her.
She's MIA.

00:01:55,072 --> 00:01:56,707
Nick...

00:01:59,476 --> 00:02:01,612
Five-point-seven.
That's the
same caliber

00:02:01,612 --> 00:02:03,347
Gabriel's guys use.
What do you want

00:02:03,347 --> 00:02:04,582
to bet somebody
called in the wrong address,

00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:05,716
bought themselves some time?

00:02:12,389 --> 00:02:14,358
Catherine?

00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,528
Hey, Catherine?

00:02:21,232 --> 00:02:22,566
Doorknob's been wiped clean.

00:02:22,566 --> 00:02:24,235
There's not a speck of dust.

00:02:24,235 --> 00:02:25,703
I smell ethanol.

00:02:25,703 --> 00:02:28,138
Just like Malcolm
Turner's law office.

00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:36,046
Bullet hole.

00:02:36,046 --> 00:02:38,015
Frame's been repaired.

00:02:38,015 --> 00:02:40,517
So has the bookcase here.

00:02:49,126 --> 00:02:51,128
Catherine's backup gun is gone.
Well, that's good.

00:02:51,128 --> 00:02:52,730
Right? I mean, that means that
she had time to get it, right?

00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:55,966
(phone ringing)
That she needs it is bad.

00:02:55,966 --> 00:02:57,401
Stokes.

00:02:58,736 --> 00:03:00,604
Oh, no.

00:03:00,604 --> 00:03:02,740
Okay, we're 10-39.

00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,375
Patrol spotted
Russell's SUV

00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:06,143
abandoned near the 215.

00:03:06,143 --> 00:03:07,711
That's a couple of blocks
from his motel call-out.

00:03:07,711 --> 00:03:09,546
And they said it's
all shot to hell.

00:03:09,546 --> 00:03:13,183
(siren wailing)

00:03:13,183 --> 00:03:16,553
(helicopter approaching)

00:03:16,553 --> 00:03:17,755
Doesn't look good.

00:03:17,755 --> 00:03:19,189
There's blood in the backseat.

00:03:19,189 --> 00:03:20,424
A lot of it.

00:03:23,627 --> 00:03:26,130
BRASS: Dispatch couldn't get
Russell on his cell phone.

00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:28,165
The walkie's
still in the car.

00:03:28,165 --> 00:03:30,234
Blood trail...
heads off that way.

00:03:30,234 --> 00:03:31,969
STOKES:
Well, we found

00:03:31,969 --> 00:03:34,204
a 5.7 shell casing outside
of Catherine's house.

00:03:34,204 --> 00:03:35,639
We also smelled

00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:37,474
ethanol inside--
evidence pointing
to a shootout,

00:03:37,474 --> 00:03:39,543
but the place was cleaned up.

00:03:39,543 --> 00:03:41,445
SIDLE: It's got Gabriel's hit
squad written all over it.

00:03:41,445 --> 00:03:43,013
There's no Catherine.

00:03:43,013 --> 00:03:44,548
Russell's unreachable.

00:03:44,548 --> 00:03:49,253
There's blood in the backseat,
none in the front.

00:03:49,253 --> 00:03:51,488
Maybe Catherine was wounded.

00:03:51,488 --> 00:03:53,223
Russell was coming
to her aid.

00:03:53,223 --> 00:03:54,625
But why didn't
they call it in?

00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:57,027
On the run,
guys shooting at them--

00:03:57,027 --> 00:03:58,729
maybe they
didn't have time.

00:03:58,729 --> 00:04:01,298
Maybe they didn't
think it was safe
to use their cell phones.

00:04:01,298 --> 00:04:03,133
If this is Gabriel's

00:04:03,133 --> 00:04:05,269
black ops boys, they have
all kinds of toys to hack

00:04:05,269 --> 00:04:08,605
our communications
and listen in.

00:04:08,605 --> 00:04:10,441
Who you calling?

00:04:10,441 --> 00:04:11,608
(phone ringing nearby)

00:04:14,511 --> 00:04:16,180
(phone continues ringing)

00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:19,350
(phone stops ringing)

00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:20,684
It's Catherine's cell.

00:04:20,684 --> 00:04:23,253
SIDLE:
They ditched their phones.

00:04:23,253 --> 00:04:24,588
(phone ringing nearby)

00:04:27,424 --> 00:04:30,694
(phone continues ringing)

00:04:32,963 --> 00:04:34,064
It's Russell's cell phone.

00:04:34,064 --> 00:04:36,166
(ringing continues)

00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:39,703
Oh, man, it's his wife calling.

00:04:42,506 --> 00:04:43,974
I'll take that.

00:04:43,974 --> 00:04:45,743
(ringing continues)
This is

00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:48,078
your crime scene...

00:04:48,078 --> 00:04:51,248
but this is my call.

00:04:54,318 --> 00:04:57,688
Mrs. Russell...

00:04:57,688 --> 00:04:59,123
this is Jim Brass.

Yeah, and hey, get me a flatbed

00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:38,562
I got to get this Denali
back to the garage.

00:05:38,562 --> 00:05:40,964
Yeah.

00:05:40,964 --> 00:05:42,466
Hey, I got to take this.

00:05:42,466 --> 00:05:43,467
All right.

00:05:43,467 --> 00:05:45,235
(phone beeps)

00:05:45,235 --> 00:05:47,271
Morgan, listen, there's
been a little change of plans.

00:05:47,271 --> 00:05:49,139
The Denali scene
is now Code Four.

00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:50,641
The blood trail went cold.

00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:52,476
I need you to redirect
to Catherine's house.

00:05:52,476 --> 00:05:54,077
Greg's on the way.

00:05:54,077 --> 00:05:55,746
Start on the perimeter,
we'll meet you there.

00:05:55,746 --> 00:05:57,281
Hey, Hodges.

00:05:57,281 --> 00:05:59,283
Yeah?
Do me a favor
and wait here

00:05:59,283 --> 00:06:00,617
for auto detail, then
follow that Denali

00:06:00,617 --> 00:06:02,019
back to the lab, okay?

00:06:02,019 --> 00:06:04,054
I'm on it.
Thanks.

00:06:04,054 --> 00:06:06,590
Henry, I'm gonna need you to run
that blood against Catherine

00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:09,092
and Russell, okay?

00:06:09,092 --> 00:06:11,595
Hey, Henry, you with me?

00:06:11,595 --> 00:06:13,397
Yeah. I just can't help
but think...

00:06:13,397 --> 00:06:15,599
Well, don't think,
man, just do it.

00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:17,334
Okay?
Hey, did Catherine

00:06:17,334 --> 00:06:18,435
say anything to you
about quitting?

00:06:18,435 --> 00:06:20,304
No, why?
She sent

00:06:20,304 --> 00:06:23,006
a resignation e-mail
to Russell.
Well, if she was

00:06:23,006 --> 00:06:25,309
gonna leave, she
would've told us first.

00:06:25,309 --> 00:06:27,110
Right?

00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:29,546
Nothing's making
sense right now.

00:06:29,546 --> 00:06:31,982
Okay, I'm sticking
with the plan--

00:06:31,982 --> 00:06:33,684
radio silence.

00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:35,986
If someone's listening in,
they won't be hearing us.

00:06:35,986 --> 00:06:37,321
Now all communication
will be face-to-face.

00:06:37,321 --> 00:06:39,089
The sheriff has agreed to wait

00:06:39,089 --> 00:06:40,424
an hour before
she calls the Feds.

00:06:40,424 --> 00:06:42,092
That buys us some time;
that's good.

00:06:42,092 --> 00:06:43,160
(phone rings)

00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,661
Stokes.

00:06:44,661 --> 00:06:46,096
ROBBINS:
I'm at Russell's crime scene.

00:06:46,096 --> 00:06:47,164
He was scheduled to meet me here

00:06:47,164 --> 00:06:48,532
an hour ago.

00:06:48,532 --> 00:06:49,633
Well, I got
a situation here, man.

00:06:49,633 --> 00:06:51,435
I'll fill you in later.

00:06:51,435 --> 00:06:53,437
I'll see if I can get us
some help

00:06:53,437 --> 00:06:55,706
from the day shift.
Okay, well, roll 'em
when you can.

00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:58,342
(phone beeps,
text alert blips)

00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:05,682
I thought you said
this was the only D.B. here?

00:07:05,682 --> 00:07:07,251
Only one I know of, Doc.

00:07:17,294 --> 00:07:18,495
You must be the doctor.

00:07:18,495 --> 00:07:19,997
What the hell's going on here?

00:07:19,997 --> 00:07:21,398
Hey, Doc.
Is that Catherine?

00:07:21,398 --> 00:07:23,233
You're gonna have
to patch her up here.

00:07:23,233 --> 00:07:25,102
We can't take her
to a hospital.

00:07:25,102 --> 00:07:27,104
She's been shot.
Luckily, we ran

00:07:27,104 --> 00:07:28,605
into an old friend
of hers.

00:07:28,605 --> 00:07:29,640
I'll fill
you in later.

00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,376
Kitty, thank you.

00:07:32,376 --> 00:07:34,678
You gotta be the last doc
in Vegas to make house calls.

00:07:34,678 --> 00:07:36,280
You got a card?
Honey,

00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,981
you don't want me
coming to your house.

00:07:37,981 --> 00:07:40,250
What do you think?

00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:43,253
I think she'd be better
off in a hospital.

00:07:43,253 --> 00:07:45,322
PRATT:
<i>You people waited</i>

00:07:45,322 --> 00:07:47,391
an <i>hour</i> to call me?

00:07:47,391 --> 00:07:48,959
I thought we were all
on the same team here.

00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:50,127
Seems to me,
Agent Pratt,

00:07:50,127 --> 00:07:51,461
every time we
call the FBI,

00:07:51,461 --> 00:07:52,996
somebody ends up dead.
ECKLIE:
Witnesses,

00:07:52,996 --> 00:07:54,364
your agents, my CSIs,

00:07:54,364 --> 00:07:56,166
all targeted, all on your watch.

00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:58,335
And now CSI Willows and Russell
have gone missing?

00:07:58,335 --> 00:08:00,537
Okay, look, you forget
that my partner,

00:08:00,537 --> 00:08:02,639
McQuaid, is dead,
all right?

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,508
You don't think I care about
the safety of CSI Russell

00:08:04,508 --> 00:08:07,578
and Willows
as much as you do?
You sure about that?

00:08:07,578 --> 00:08:09,346
I'm sure of one thing--
I'm pulling rank.

00:08:09,346 --> 00:08:12,282
From now on, everything
goes through me.
Oh, God...

00:08:12,282 --> 00:08:13,650
Understood?

00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:15,118
Mark Gabriel's
on his way down here

00:08:15,118 --> 00:08:16,587
demanding to see
his wife's body.

00:08:18,155 --> 00:08:19,556
Don't worry, we got your back.

00:08:19,556 --> 00:08:21,124
We'll scrape you
off of the floor

00:08:21,124 --> 00:08:22,693
after he runs you over.

00:08:22,693 --> 00:08:24,261
BRODY:
Hey, Greg.

00:08:24,261 --> 00:08:26,163
Got a blood drop.

00:08:26,163 --> 00:08:27,397
And I found blood
on the driveway

00:08:27,397 --> 00:08:28,599
leading from
the front door.

00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,036
BRODY: Blood trail leads
into the street.

00:08:38,108 --> 00:08:39,376
Blood pool.

00:08:40,644 --> 00:08:43,013
Car drove through it.

00:08:43,013 --> 00:08:46,249
Working theory...

00:08:46,249 --> 00:08:47,651
it's Catherine's.

00:08:47,651 --> 00:08:49,252
<i>She's running</i>
<i>from the shooters.</i>

00:08:49,252 --> 00:08:51,588
<i>Wounded.</i>
<i>She gets to the street,</i>

00:08:51,588 --> 00:08:52,756
<i>her blood's pooling...</i>

00:08:52,756 --> 00:08:54,157
Get in.

00:08:54,157 --> 00:08:55,592
<i>Flags down a motorist...</i>

00:08:55,592 --> 00:08:57,494
<i>It's Russell.</i>

00:08:57,494 --> 00:08:58,996
<i>The shooters are closing in...</i>

00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:01,264
(automatic gunfire,
bullets pinging)

00:09:01,264 --> 00:09:04,368
Then she jumps in the backseat,
and they take off.

00:09:04,368 --> 00:09:06,470
But if that's the case,

00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:09,606
whose blood is this over here?

00:09:09,606 --> 00:09:12,409
Trail leads down the embankment.

00:09:12,409 --> 00:09:15,012
Let's see what we find
on the other end.

00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:29,126
I've seen these
bugs before.

00:09:29,126 --> 00:09:30,527
They're the same
supercharged

00:09:30,527 --> 00:09:32,295
hide beetles
that Gabriel's guys used

00:09:32,295 --> 00:09:34,264
on those bodies at the law firm.

00:09:34,264 --> 00:09:37,367
Based on the timeline, it's only
been here three or four hours.

00:09:37,367 --> 00:09:39,202
The question is,
who was he?

00:09:41,672 --> 00:09:44,741
(siren wailing, passing by)

00:09:44,741 --> 00:09:46,076
How bad is it?

00:09:46,076 --> 00:09:47,411
It's through and through,

00:09:47,411 --> 00:09:49,112
but it didn't
hit anything vital.

00:09:49,112 --> 00:09:51,982
Well, that's good.
Beats the alternative.

00:09:51,982 --> 00:09:53,250
You've lost a lot of blood,

00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,519
and there's only
so much I can do.

00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,521
You're doing fine, Doc.

00:09:57,521 --> 00:10:00,190
Well, we've got to
stop this bleeding.

00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:02,359
And the wound needs
to be cauterized.
Mm.

00:10:02,359 --> 00:10:05,662
(siren wails, departing)

00:10:05,662 --> 00:10:07,330
Well, actually,

00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:09,299
you've got very
beautiful hair, Miss Kitty.

00:10:09,299 --> 00:10:11,201
Thanks, but I'm not
doing you-- you a cop.

00:10:11,201 --> 00:10:12,736
RUSSELL:
No. I just thought

00:10:12,736 --> 00:10:15,505
maybe you might have
a curling iron in your purse.

00:10:15,505 --> 00:10:17,607
You some kind of Columbo
or something?

00:10:22,045 --> 00:10:23,346
What do you think?

00:10:23,346 --> 00:10:24,548
Yeah. Well, it's
only gonna hurt

00:10:24,548 --> 00:10:25,749
for a moment.

00:10:25,749 --> 00:10:26,750
Once you go
into shock...

00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,385
Hell, y'all
are serious.

00:10:28,385 --> 00:10:30,153
I guess if you need
a hand or something...

00:10:30,153 --> 00:10:32,489
You're hired.
Clean it with soap and water

00:10:32,489 --> 00:10:33,690
and warm it up.

00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:34,758
(groans softly)

00:10:34,758 --> 00:10:36,526
You got a bullet I can bite on?

00:10:38,328 --> 00:10:39,463
STOKES:
Got a bullet here.

00:10:41,565 --> 00:10:43,366
Looks like a .40 cal.

00:10:43,366 --> 00:10:45,268
That's the same caliber
as the bullets that killed

00:10:45,268 --> 00:10:48,238
Laura Gabriel's cousin and
her husband at the farmhouse.

00:10:48,238 --> 00:10:50,440
STOKES:
Same shooter maybe.

00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,175
I got a blood pool.

00:10:52,175 --> 00:10:56,446
Morgan thinks that Catherine
wasn't hit until she was

00:10:56,446 --> 00:10:58,482
outside.

00:10:58,482 --> 00:11:00,751
Maybe Catherine
got one of them.

00:11:00,751 --> 00:11:03,220
Cleaning crew missed
the rug pad.

00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,055
Maybe we can get some DNA.

00:11:08,258 --> 00:11:10,127
You got any cash?

00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:11,361
ROBBINS:
Couple of hundred.

00:11:11,361 --> 00:11:12,562
RUSSELL:
Yeah. That'll do.

00:11:12,562 --> 00:11:13,964
Miss Kitty,

00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:14,965
thank you.

00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:16,233
You've earned that.

00:11:16,233 --> 00:11:17,968
You really, really
hooked us up.

00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:20,570
Here, I'd like
to give these to you, too.

00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:22,739
Oh.

00:11:22,739 --> 00:11:24,141
Thank you.

00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:25,542
You saved my life.

00:11:25,542 --> 00:11:27,344
RUSSELL:
Okay.

00:11:27,344 --> 00:11:29,546
This is
a get-out-of-jail-free card.

00:11:29,546 --> 00:11:31,081
Don't abuse it.

00:11:31,081 --> 00:11:32,582
And please,
don't talk to anyone.

00:11:32,582 --> 00:11:35,051
These lips are sealed.

00:11:35,051 --> 00:11:36,620
Didn't see nothing,
don't know nothing.

00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,555
And you can hang me by my feet

00:11:38,555 --> 00:11:40,490
and pull out my acrylic nails
with pliers.

00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:41,525
RUSSELL:
All right.

00:11:41,525 --> 00:11:43,460
Let's go.
Bye.

00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,228
RUSSELL:
Bye.

00:11:45,228 --> 00:11:48,198
D.B., Catherine's gonna
need to sleep for a while.

00:11:48,198 --> 00:11:50,467
I need you to get
a message to Brass, okay?

00:11:50,467 --> 00:11:53,537
Tell him to...
tell him to bring us in.

00:11:53,537 --> 00:11:57,274
(indistinct background
radio communication)

00:12:00,243 --> 00:12:01,444
Mitch?

00:12:01,444 --> 00:12:02,979
CSI is finished.

00:12:02,979 --> 00:12:04,514
They said we can
release the scene.

00:12:04,514 --> 00:12:05,749
The body's been transported?

00:12:05,749 --> 00:12:07,284
Ten minutes ago.

00:12:07,284 --> 00:12:08,685
Well, then, I
am done, too.

00:12:08,685 --> 00:12:10,720
Take care.
Take care, Doc.

00:12:23,466 --> 00:12:26,970
(phone ringing)

00:12:39,282 --> 00:12:40,717
ECKLIE:
Mr. Gabriel,

00:12:40,717 --> 00:12:42,752
Undersheriff Ecklie.
I believe you know...

00:12:42,752 --> 00:12:44,521
Get him the hell
out of here.

00:12:44,521 --> 00:12:46,223
You killed my wife,
you son of a bitch.

00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:48,258
And don't think being
FBI will save you.

00:12:48,258 --> 00:12:50,160
I've got the director
on my speed dial.

00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,262
You're the one who killed
your wife and my partner.

00:12:52,262 --> 00:12:53,663
If you think
you can play the victim--

00:12:53,663 --> 00:12:55,398
If this man remains,
then I'm leaving.

00:12:55,398 --> 00:12:57,234
And then, you,
Undersheriff

00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:58,635
and Captain Brass,
will speak to my

00:12:58,635 --> 00:13:00,437
attorneys while I
speak to the press.

00:13:00,437 --> 00:13:03,707
Agent Pratt, it looks like
this one goes through us.

00:13:03,707 --> 00:13:05,709
I'm going to nail your ass.

00:13:05,709 --> 00:13:08,245
Don't try and hide behind
that frigging mirror, Boy Scout.

00:13:10,513 --> 00:13:12,983
I came here
to see my wife.

00:13:12,983 --> 00:13:15,585
Understood, but first, we'd like
to ask you a few questions.

00:13:15,585 --> 00:13:17,287
I wasn't making a request.

00:13:17,287 --> 00:13:19,256
Neither were we.
(knocking)

00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:20,590
Jim, I need to see you...

00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,225
Doc, whatever it is,
it's got to wait.

00:13:22,225 --> 00:13:24,494
It can't.

00:13:24,494 --> 00:13:27,430
(tires squealing)

00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:46,249
(Brass groans, sighs)

00:13:46,249 --> 00:13:47,284
We're too late.

00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:49,686
What the hell happened?

00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,426
We're still maintaining
radio silence, right?
Yeah.

00:13:56,426 --> 00:13:59,062
So how'd the bad guys get here
before we did?
I don't know.

00:13:59,062 --> 00:14:01,264
Maybe they showed up late
for the party, too.

00:14:01,264 --> 00:14:03,733
The screen's off.

00:14:03,733 --> 00:14:06,436
Scuff marks.

00:14:09,005 --> 00:14:10,573
Maybe Catherine and Russell
made a quick exit.

00:14:10,573 --> 00:14:11,741
I'm gonna go talk
to the manager,

00:14:11,741 --> 00:14:13,677
see if
he saw something.

00:14:13,677 --> 00:14:15,712
I hope they made it out of here.

00:14:18,415 --> 00:14:21,151
Yeah, that get-out-of-jail-free
card-- that work for me, too?

00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:22,285
Don't ask that when my friends

00:14:22,285 --> 00:14:23,486
are running
for their lives.

00:14:23,486 --> 00:14:24,988
Oh, well, let me
rephrase then.

00:14:24,988 --> 00:14:26,256
When y'all
stop running,

00:14:26,256 --> 00:14:27,691
can a brother get one?

00:14:27,691 --> 00:14:29,292
If we get out of this alive,

00:14:29,292 --> 00:14:31,127
I'll get you one
with revolving credit.

00:14:31,127 --> 00:14:33,029
Yeah, I like the sound of that.

00:14:33,029 --> 00:14:34,564
Hey, if there's any
revolving credit, it's mine.

00:14:34,564 --> 00:14:37,467
I'm the one who spotted that guy
in that raincoat.

00:14:37,467 --> 00:14:39,069
Knew his ass
was up to no good.

00:14:39,069 --> 00:14:40,704
Yeah, thank you for that call.

00:14:40,704 --> 00:14:42,472
What tipped you off?

00:14:42,472 --> 00:14:44,474
Honey, in that neighborhood,
the only suit a man wears

00:14:44,474 --> 00:14:47,110
under his trench coat
is his birthday suit.

00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:48,211
RUSSELL:
Spoken like

00:14:48,211 --> 00:14:50,213
a trained observer.

00:14:50,213 --> 00:14:51,982
WILLOWS:
In a couple of blocks,

00:14:51,982 --> 00:14:55,185
there's gonna be an alley
on your right.

00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:57,620
Hey, Doc.

00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,122
Hey.
How's Catherine?

00:14:59,122 --> 00:15:00,724
She should be on some
heavy-duty antibiotics.

00:15:00,724 --> 00:15:02,492
You don't know, do you?

00:15:02,492 --> 00:15:05,061
What?
She and Russell are
still out there, man.

00:15:05,061 --> 00:15:07,197
When Brass got to the
motel, they were gone.

00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:09,466
He said it looked like they
went out a bathroom window.

00:15:09,466 --> 00:15:11,601
Catherine's in no condition
to be on the run.
I know that.

00:15:11,601 --> 00:15:13,336
Certainly not with
a hit team chasing her.

00:15:13,336 --> 00:15:15,672
Well, let's hope that we get
to them before they do.

00:15:15,672 --> 00:15:17,140
What can this
stiff tell us

00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,475
about the guys who
might be after them?

00:15:18,475 --> 00:15:21,344
Uh, he appears
to be a middle-aged, white male.

00:15:21,344 --> 00:15:23,346
Hide beetles consumed
all of his skin

00:15:23,346 --> 00:15:24,581
and most of his tissue.

00:15:24,581 --> 00:15:27,283
He was shot four times.
Check this out.

00:15:27,283 --> 00:15:30,320
Three of the shots
entered the mid-back,

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,455
the fourth shot penetrated
the frontal lobe.

00:15:32,455 --> 00:15:34,391
These look like 5.7's.

00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:36,393
I was thinking Catherine was
the one who hit this guy.

00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:37,527
You were thinking wrong.

00:15:37,527 --> 00:15:39,229
Five-sevens suggest

00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:42,532
friendly fire from one
of the other hit men.

00:15:42,532 --> 00:15:43,733
(gunfire)

00:15:43,733 --> 00:15:45,301
(grunting)

00:15:48,004 --> 00:15:49,739
STOKES:
<i>Yeah, the coup de grâce</i>
<i>to finish him off.</i>

00:15:53,143 --> 00:15:56,046
Cloak and dagger is a little bit
outside my area of expertise.

00:15:56,046 --> 00:15:58,248
But if these black ops guys
were so good

00:15:58,248 --> 00:15:59,549
at cleaning up
crime scenes,

00:15:59,549 --> 00:16:01,184
why didn't they just
take him with them?

00:16:01,184 --> 00:16:03,720
A wounded man would only
slow them down, I guess.

00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,423
But still, for pros,

00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:09,392
they sure have been
making a lot of mistakes.

00:16:09,392 --> 00:16:10,994
Here, put this on.

00:16:10,994 --> 00:16:12,228
You're gonna need
to cover all that up.

00:16:12,228 --> 00:16:13,563
Thank you.

00:16:13,563 --> 00:16:17,067
Hey, Jackory, hate to ask you
for another favor,

00:16:17,067 --> 00:16:18,168
but I need a cell phone.

00:16:18,168 --> 00:16:19,436
Can I borrow one?

00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:21,438
Swear to God,
I'll get it back to you.

00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:26,543
(laughing):
Oh.

00:16:26,543 --> 00:16:28,144
Take your pick.

00:16:28,144 --> 00:16:31,047
Disposable,
can't be traced.
(laughs)

00:16:31,047 --> 00:16:33,049
Thank you.

00:16:33,049 --> 00:16:36,386
And I got a feeling you're
going to be needing this, too.

00:16:36,386 --> 00:16:38,688
Yeah, that's more, uh,

00:16:38,688 --> 00:16:40,056
Annie Oakley here.

00:16:46,963 --> 00:16:48,698
You may not be
getting that back.

00:16:48,698 --> 00:16:50,967
Darling, the way you're handling
that piece, I think I will.

00:16:52,669 --> 00:16:55,071
Thank you, guys.

00:16:55,071 --> 00:16:56,406
Thank you.

00:16:56,406 --> 00:16:58,308
KITTY:
You two take care.

00:17:00,977 --> 00:17:03,279
This is your idea of a
safe place to hide out?

00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,416
When we're in Seattle,
we can go to your coffeehouse.

00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:07,617
MAN:
Yeah?

00:17:07,617 --> 00:17:09,319
Yeah, I need to see Teddy Jr.

00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,720
You got a name?

00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,023
Just, uh, tell him
it's... Goldilocks.

00:17:14,023 --> 00:17:15,558
(chuckles)

00:17:15,558 --> 00:17:23,500
♪ ♪

00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:36,212
Hey, Teddy.
Goldilocks!

00:17:36,212 --> 00:17:38,615
Oh, God, it's been too long.

00:17:38,615 --> 00:17:41,017
It sure has. Mm.

00:17:41,017 --> 00:17:42,418
Wish the old man
was still with us.

00:17:42,418 --> 00:17:44,420
He always loved
when you stopped by.

00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:46,489
Even after
you became a cop.
Teddy, listen,

00:17:46,489 --> 00:17:50,527
um... I'm in kind of a jam.

00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:52,028
You need a doctor?
No, I'm fine.

00:17:52,028 --> 00:17:53,730
It actually looks
worse than it is,

00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:58,301
but my friend Russell and I
need to disappear for a while.

00:17:59,569 --> 00:18:01,271
No problem.

00:18:01,271 --> 00:18:04,574
The old man would have rolled
out the red carpet for you.

00:18:04,574 --> 00:18:06,009
Sit down.

00:18:06,009 --> 00:18:07,277
Thanks, Teddy.

00:18:07,277 --> 00:18:08,411
TEDDY: I'll get you
some sandwiches.

00:18:14,217 --> 00:18:16,519
So... Goldilocks?

00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:18,121
(laughs)

00:18:18,121 --> 00:18:21,391
Uh, well, there was a time

00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:25,295
when the only thing I cared
more about than having fun was

00:18:25,295 --> 00:18:27,063
getting attention,

00:18:27,063 --> 00:18:29,399
and a girl gets a lot
of attention on a pole.

00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:31,701
But the thing is--
thank you--

00:18:31,701 --> 00:18:35,271
working a pole
is about working guys.

00:18:35,271 --> 00:18:38,675
Lonely guys with money who just
want to forget their problems.

00:18:38,675 --> 00:18:40,643
Well, one night,

00:18:40,643 --> 00:18:44,380
right here at this bar,
I met a guy who had a problem,

00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,216
but he wasn't trying
to forget it.

00:18:46,216 --> 00:18:47,550
He was trying to solve it.

00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:49,252
Who was the guy?

00:18:49,252 --> 00:18:52,088
Jimmy Tadero. Detective.

00:18:52,088 --> 00:18:53,423
Well, he was working a case,

00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:56,059
and we started talking.

00:18:56,059 --> 00:18:59,262
For once, someone saw me

00:18:59,262 --> 00:19:01,497
as more than just a pretty face.

00:19:01,497 --> 00:19:03,199
And a few other attributes.

00:19:03,199 --> 00:19:05,235
Jimmy sounds like
a very wise man.

00:19:05,235 --> 00:19:08,638
After that night,
between dances,

00:19:08,638 --> 00:19:13,042
we would, uh,
sit here at this bar, and...

00:19:13,042 --> 00:19:17,413
he'd run cases,
and he'd ask my opinion.

00:19:17,413 --> 00:19:20,717
So, this is where
you became a CSI.

00:19:20,717 --> 00:19:22,151
Yeah.

00:19:22,151 --> 00:19:23,620
Well, how about...

00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:27,257
how about you run this
case with me right now?

00:19:27,257 --> 00:19:28,524
Don't you think you should

00:19:28,524 --> 00:19:30,226
make a phone call first,
to your wife?

00:19:30,226 --> 00:19:33,196
Oh.
When was the last time
you went 24 hours

00:19:33,196 --> 00:19:34,430
without talking to her?

00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:36,332
(keypad beeping)

00:19:36,332 --> 00:19:37,634
Hey, doll.
No, I'm sorry.

00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:39,602
I, um... I'm okay.

00:19:39,602 --> 00:19:41,671
I just lost my phone
out in the field.

00:19:41,671 --> 00:19:44,374
I'm at a strip club
with Catherine.

00:19:46,376 --> 00:19:49,445
Why do you always assume that
I'm out on a job or something?

00:19:49,445 --> 00:19:53,983
You know, I could have come
here just for myself, you know.

00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:54,717
PRATT:
<i>We still don't know</i>

00:19:54,717 --> 00:19:56,419
where they are?

00:19:56,419 --> 00:19:58,421
I would assume
they're out there on the move.

00:19:58,421 --> 00:20:00,023
It's a lot safer
than coming in here.
Can't blame them.

00:20:00,023 --> 00:20:01,291
What do we have?

00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:03,526
First blush-- a hit
team gone wild.

00:20:03,526 --> 00:20:04,961
But more miss
than hit lately.

00:20:04,961 --> 00:20:06,429
I don't get it.

00:20:06,429 --> 00:20:08,631
These guys are supposed
to be the best in the world.

00:20:08,631 --> 00:20:10,600
At least that's what
you keep telling us, right?

00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,302
That's their rep.

00:20:12,302 --> 00:20:14,304
And we saw that
at Malcolm Turner's law office--

00:20:14,304 --> 00:20:16,639
covert, efficient,
clean, A-plus.

00:20:16,639 --> 00:20:19,075
Yeah, but it wasn't perfect.
We found the bodies.

00:20:19,075 --> 00:20:21,377
With 5.7-caliber bullets
in them.

00:20:21,377 --> 00:20:24,013
Yeah, and picked clean by
those bioengineered bugs.

00:20:24,013 --> 00:20:26,049
SIDLE: All of which strongly
suggests Mark Gabriel's

00:20:26,049 --> 00:20:27,250
hand in the killings.

00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,451
Exactly.

00:20:28,451 --> 00:20:30,386
Which is just the start
of the screwups.

00:20:30,386 --> 00:20:33,289
Since then, these A students
have been turning in B work.

00:20:33,289 --> 00:20:36,392
Two days ago, Laura Gabriel's
cousin's house, husband and wife

00:20:36,392 --> 00:20:38,227
murdered, and there was
no attempt to clean up.

00:20:38,227 --> 00:20:40,163
And the world's greatest
hit team couldn't even find

00:20:40,163 --> 00:20:42,098
Laura Gabriel hiding
under the floorboards.

00:20:42,098 --> 00:20:44,000
They still got to her
yesterday.
STOKES:
Yeah.

00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,568
And made a total mess of it.

00:20:45,568 --> 00:20:48,137
That FBI convoy hit was on a
public street in broad daylight.

00:20:48,137 --> 00:20:49,672
SIDLE: Not to mention,
two hours later,

00:20:49,672 --> 00:20:51,674
Catherine's targeted.

00:20:51,674 --> 00:20:54,344
Even with the element
of surprise, they missed.

00:20:54,344 --> 00:20:56,179
And hit one of their own.
Friendly fire.

00:20:56,179 --> 00:20:57,647
They finished him
off, left him

00:20:57,647 --> 00:21:00,283
in a culvert with Mark Gabriel's
superbugs on him.

00:21:00,283 --> 00:21:02,685
Might as well have left
a calling card.

00:21:02,685 --> 00:21:04,253
STOKES:
These guys sanitize

00:21:04,253 --> 00:21:05,688
some scenes
and muck up others.

00:21:05,688 --> 00:21:07,123
Why the inconsistencies?

00:21:07,123 --> 00:21:08,391
I know Mark Gabriel.

00:21:08,391 --> 00:21:09,659
He doesn't make
these kinds of mistakes.

00:21:09,659 --> 00:21:11,461
Maybe they aren't mistakes.

00:21:11,461 --> 00:21:12,962
Maybe it's all intentional.

00:21:12,962 --> 00:21:14,464
You think
that Mark Gabriel's

00:21:14,464 --> 00:21:16,299
guys are leaving evidence
behind on purpose?

00:21:16,299 --> 00:21:17,967
Not just any evidence.

00:21:17,967 --> 00:21:19,635
Evidence that points
to Mark Gabriel.

00:21:19,635 --> 00:21:20,970
PRATT:
If what you're suggesting

00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:23,339
is true...

00:21:23,339 --> 00:21:25,274
then Mark Gabriel's not
the one calling the shots.

00:21:25,274 --> 00:21:27,377
He's...
he's being set up.

00:21:27,377 --> 00:21:29,278
By who?

00:21:29,278 --> 00:21:31,013
And why?

00:21:33,015 --> 00:21:34,617
Thank you very much.

00:21:34,617 --> 00:21:36,085
How you doing?

00:21:36,085 --> 00:21:37,553
You all right?

00:21:37,553 --> 00:21:39,288
Well, considering
I've been shot in my side

00:21:39,288 --> 00:21:41,124
and cauterized
by a hooker's curling iron,

00:21:41,124 --> 00:21:42,258
yeah, I guess so.

00:21:42,258 --> 00:21:43,593
So, you said

00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:45,294
you wanted to talk
about the case?
Yeah.

00:21:45,294 --> 00:21:49,198
I want to talk about
how Mark Gabriel is not our guy.

00:21:49,198 --> 00:21:50,400
Excuse me?

00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,467
The resignation letter--

00:21:51,467 --> 00:21:53,603
you didn't send it, did you?

00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:55,271
What resignation letter?

00:21:55,271 --> 00:21:57,407
This one.

00:21:57,407 --> 00:22:02,545
I, uh, printed it out before
I drove over to see you.

00:22:02,545 --> 00:22:05,281
Uh, "effective
immediately, I tender

00:22:05,281 --> 00:22:06,983
"my resignation.

00:22:06,983 --> 00:22:08,684
"It's a decision I've
been considering

00:22:08,684 --> 00:22:09,986
"for a while...

00:22:09,986 --> 00:22:11,421
it's best for the team..."

00:22:11,421 --> 00:22:12,989
I didn't write that.

00:22:12,989 --> 00:22:14,524
But wait, it gets better;
here you go.

00:22:14,524 --> 00:22:16,692
"I've made the decision
to go away for a while,

00:22:16,692 --> 00:22:20,029
"but first, I have
to do something.

00:22:20,029 --> 00:22:23,065
"I have one last bit
of unfinished business

00:22:23,065 --> 00:22:24,200
"to clear my desk.

00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,035
I hope you'll understand."

00:22:26,035 --> 00:22:27,170
What the hell?

00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:28,638
Listen, I think
you need to read

00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:31,040
this whole email
resignation you sent.

00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,643
I think you'll find it's
not that far off the mark.

00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:36,345
"For 19 years, I've dedicated
myself to this lab.

00:22:36,345 --> 00:22:38,448
"My authority
has been questioned.

00:22:38,448 --> 00:22:40,249
"My professional
objectivity doubted.

00:22:40,249 --> 00:22:43,286
"Though I graciously accepted

00:22:43,286 --> 00:22:46,422
an unwanted demotion,

00:22:46,422 --> 00:22:51,127
I now find my lesser role
unsatisfying and untenable."

00:22:51,127 --> 00:22:53,095
Little close to the bone,
I imagine.

00:22:54,564 --> 00:22:56,332
How did they know?

00:22:56,332 --> 00:22:57,967
Well, if they were able to
hack into your account

00:22:57,967 --> 00:22:59,535
to send that email,

00:22:59,535 --> 00:23:01,237
I imagine they've been
reading them all.

00:23:01,237 --> 00:23:02,405
All to manufacture
a resignation letter?

00:23:02,405 --> 00:23:04,373
I-I don't think so.

00:23:04,373 --> 00:23:06,442
I think it's more of a...
like, a cover story, right?

00:23:06,442 --> 00:23:09,645
CSI seeks revenge for the
murder of her friend.

00:23:09,645 --> 00:23:12,315
Goes nuts, goes home, resigns.

00:23:12,315 --> 00:23:15,251
But not before she commits
one last crazy act.

00:23:15,251 --> 00:23:17,720
And who does she direct
her rage against?

00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,355
Mark Gabriel.

00:23:19,355 --> 00:23:22,258
Then that's gotta be why
they took my backup gun.

00:23:22,258 --> 00:23:25,094
They were planning to use it
on-on Gabriel.

00:23:25,094 --> 00:23:26,295
To make you the patsy.

00:23:26,295 --> 00:23:28,197
I go postal, I kill Gabriel

00:23:28,197 --> 00:23:30,666
and then... get disappeared.

00:23:30,666 --> 00:23:33,469
Yeah, but you screwed up
their plans-- you survived.

00:23:33,469 --> 00:23:35,171
All I know is that

00:23:35,171 --> 00:23:37,573
with you still alive,
they've got no play.

00:23:37,573 --> 00:23:40,076
So, safest thing for
you to do right now

00:23:40,076 --> 00:23:42,144
is to come in out of the cold.

00:23:42,144 --> 00:23:45,381
Well, safe for me,
maybe, but then

00:23:45,381 --> 00:23:48,284
they'll go underground
and we'll never catch them.

00:23:48,284 --> 00:23:49,585
Hey, Teddy.

00:23:49,585 --> 00:23:51,053
Maybe we can have
it both ways.

00:23:51,053 --> 00:23:52,455
I need one more favor.
No problem.

00:23:52,455 --> 00:23:54,624
Can you call the
coroner and tell him

00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:56,959
that you got two stiffs
here that need picking up.

00:23:56,959 --> 00:23:59,095
And make sure to
bring two body bags.

00:23:59,095 --> 00:24:00,730
One extra long.

00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:04,100
You got it.

00:24:13,142 --> 00:24:14,343
(groans)

00:24:14,343 --> 00:24:15,645
STOKES:
Welcome back to the living.

00:24:15,645 --> 00:24:18,514
Heard you been hitting
the strip clubs.

00:24:18,514 --> 00:24:21,217
Yeah, why is that so hard
for everyone to believe?

00:24:21,217 --> 00:24:23,553
Coming through.

00:24:29,158 --> 00:24:30,993
SANDERS:
Aren't you a sight
for sore eyes.

00:24:30,993 --> 00:24:32,695
For a second
we thought you were...

00:24:32,695 --> 00:24:34,697
That you ran off
to a Caribbean island

00:24:34,697 --> 00:24:37,400
and left us with your caseload.

00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,135
No, I'm not running anymore.

00:24:39,135 --> 00:24:40,970
That's 'cause
we're on the hunt now.

00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:42,538
I'm going to need
to redress that wound.

00:24:42,538 --> 00:24:44,674
And I'm going
to need to redress.

00:24:44,674 --> 00:24:46,342
(groans)

00:24:50,479 --> 00:24:51,681
So that, uh,

00:24:51,681 --> 00:24:54,050
resignation letter
was a fake.

00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:56,285
Yeah, a good one.

00:24:56,285 --> 00:24:57,620
They hacked your computer.

00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,455
They've been reading
your email.

00:24:59,455 --> 00:25:01,524
Getting inside my head.

00:25:01,524 --> 00:25:04,660
So, you really feel that way?

00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:07,063
Something's missing
in your life?

00:25:09,031 --> 00:25:13,703
Since Lindsey's left home, yeah.

00:25:13,703 --> 00:25:15,705
I mean, I'm not sure
what I'm missing.

00:25:15,705 --> 00:25:20,076
Some days, I... I think it's
a man to share my life with,

00:25:20,076 --> 00:25:21,744
and... then,
other days, I'm good.

00:25:21,744 --> 00:25:23,312
I'm good to be alone.

00:25:23,312 --> 00:25:26,215
I mean, look at my friend Laura.

00:25:26,215 --> 00:25:28,417
(groans)
She had everything.

00:25:28,417 --> 00:25:32,388
Appeared to have a perfect life.

00:25:32,388 --> 00:25:36,492
And it all turned
out to be a lie.

00:25:36,492 --> 00:25:38,060
(sighs)

00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:40,029
And then she turned out dead.

00:25:40,029 --> 00:25:41,097
I thought for
sure Mark Gabriel

00:25:41,097 --> 00:25:44,066
killed her, tried to kill me.

00:25:44,066 --> 00:25:46,068
Now we know it was all a setup.

00:25:46,068 --> 00:25:47,637
Yeah, who's pulling
the strings?

00:25:47,637 --> 00:25:50,072
It's gotta be someone
in his operation, right?

00:25:50,072 --> 00:25:52,642
I'm going with Occam's razor.

00:25:52,642 --> 00:25:55,111
Sometimes
the simplest answer

00:25:55,111 --> 00:25:56,412
is the right answer,

00:25:56,412 --> 00:25:59,115
and the one that's right
in front of you.

00:26:01,117 --> 00:26:02,585
Until a couple weeks ago,

00:26:02,585 --> 00:26:04,020
you didn't even know
who Mark Gabriel was.

00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,222
And you hadn't seen

00:26:06,222 --> 00:26:09,025
your good friend Laura
since you were kids.

00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:11,093
What are you saying?

00:26:11,093 --> 00:26:14,130
I'm saying, maybe you didn't
just run into your friend.

00:26:16,632 --> 00:26:18,701
I think that Sara
might be right.

00:26:18,701 --> 00:26:21,103
I see Laura after
all these years

00:26:21,103 --> 00:26:24,607
in reception at PD,
waiting for her husband.

00:26:24,607 --> 00:26:26,142
She allows me

00:26:26,142 --> 00:26:28,377
to see her in a controlling,

00:26:28,377 --> 00:26:31,280
abusive relationship; she then
comes to me, says she's got

00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,582
information on her husband
that can put him away.

00:26:33,582 --> 00:26:36,519
She's afraid,
I send her to a lawyer.

00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:38,254
Who ends up dead.
Yes.

00:26:38,254 --> 00:26:41,657
All signs pointing
to her husband, Mark Gabriel,

00:26:41,657 --> 00:26:43,292
as the guy
who hired the killers.

00:26:43,292 --> 00:26:45,428
Yes, but if it's
not Gabriel,

00:26:45,428 --> 00:26:47,029
and he's being set up
to look guilty...

00:26:47,029 --> 00:26:48,564
And to die by your hand.

00:26:48,564 --> 00:26:50,032
Who stands to benefit?

00:26:50,032 --> 00:26:51,600
The wife...

00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,437
<i>who is dead</i>
<i>and burned beyond recognition.</i>

00:26:54,437 --> 00:26:57,006
You know, like everything
else in this damn case,

00:26:57,006 --> 00:26:58,274
all is not what it seems.

00:26:58,274 --> 00:27:00,009
Hey, Henry.

00:27:00,009 --> 00:27:01,043
Henry, where...

00:27:01,043 --> 00:27:02,078
(thumps)
Ow.

00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:03,279
Aw, I'm sorry,

00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:04,547
did we wake you up?

00:27:04,547 --> 00:27:06,315
It's been a rough 48.

00:27:06,315 --> 00:27:08,350
You think?
Hey, what did you use

00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:12,421
as an exemplar to identify the
burned bodies in the FBI sedan?

00:27:12,421 --> 00:27:13,723
Well, the agents were easy.

00:27:13,723 --> 00:27:15,624
I just ran their DNA
against the FBI database.

00:27:15,624 --> 00:27:18,027
What about Laura Gabriel?
I had exemplars

00:27:18,027 --> 00:27:20,996
from the Gabriels' condo
here in Vegas.

00:27:20,996 --> 00:27:22,264
What do you think?

00:27:22,264 --> 00:27:23,999
Plenty of opportunity

00:27:23,999 --> 00:27:26,702
to plant someone else's comb
or toothbrush in that condo.

00:27:29,205 --> 00:27:31,273
We have another exemplar.

00:27:31,273 --> 00:27:34,009
Laura's clothes were bagged
at the hospital

00:27:34,009 --> 00:27:35,344
after we found her
at her cousin's house.

00:27:35,344 --> 00:27:37,480
Okay, so run those clothes,

00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,683
and then compare the new
exemplar to our female DB.

00:27:40,683 --> 00:27:43,452
And I want to run all the DNA
in this case against every

00:27:43,452 --> 00:27:45,254
known database.

00:27:45,254 --> 00:27:46,388
Got it.

What are you talking about?

00:28:49,685 --> 00:28:52,488
We ran the DNA

PRATT:
She was one of the assassins

00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:01,630
who hit the law firm.

00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:05,134
She infiltrated your protection
detail yesterday.

00:29:05,134 --> 00:29:07,269
Well, how did she end up dead
in the back of the FBI sedan?

00:29:07,269 --> 00:29:09,004
My guess,

00:29:09,004 --> 00:29:11,507
shot by someone she trusted
when she wasn't looking.

00:29:11,507 --> 00:29:13,342
And then somebody
took a torch to her,

00:29:13,342 --> 00:29:15,477
because they wanted us to
believe she was Laura Gabriel.

00:29:15,477 --> 00:29:18,280
RUSSELL: For the same reason
they wanted us to believe

00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:22,751
the guy sitting next to her
was your partner, Agent McQuaid.

00:29:22,751 --> 00:29:25,187
No, no, McQuaid
died in that car.

00:29:25,187 --> 00:29:27,223
He was identified
by the FBI database.

00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:29,692
Which McQuaid
updated with a new exemplar

00:29:29,692 --> 00:29:32,528
one month ago.

00:29:32,528 --> 00:29:34,296

Same military database

00:29:34,296 --> 00:29:36,198
identified the McQuaid body

00:29:36,198 --> 00:29:38,968
as a Geoffrey Krueger.

00:29:38,968 --> 00:29:40,636
ECKLIE: Like our female
assassin-- ex-Army,

00:29:40,636 --> 00:29:43,205
and now former
Ceressus employee.

00:29:43,205 --> 00:29:45,541
Wait a second-- no, no, no,
I don't believe any of this.

00:29:45,541 --> 00:29:48,611
You're telling me that,
uh, McQuaid is...

00:29:48,611 --> 00:29:50,179
Dirty.

00:29:50,179 --> 00:29:51,747
And that he and Laura

00:29:51,747 --> 00:29:54,416
are the ones
behind this whole thing.

00:29:54,416 --> 00:29:56,151
Three other agents
died in that ambush.

00:29:56,151 --> 00:29:58,988
Not to mention, the couple
from the farmhouse,

00:29:58,988 --> 00:30:00,689
those people from
the law firm--

00:30:00,689 --> 00:30:01,724
why would he do that?

00:30:01,724 --> 00:30:03,292
Sex, money...

00:30:03,292 --> 00:30:05,728
...maybe both.
We know your team
was compromised.

00:30:05,728 --> 00:30:09,398
And to be honest, until now,
I thought it was you.

00:30:09,398 --> 00:30:13,002
I'm sorry, is that supposed
to make me feel better?

00:30:19,508 --> 00:30:21,143
Hey, come on.

00:30:21,143 --> 00:30:22,711
None of us saw
this coming.

00:30:22,711 --> 00:30:24,113
Yeah, but I worked
with the guy,

00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:25,714
ten hours a days,
for the past year.

00:30:25,714 --> 00:30:28,450
I mean, it's not like we
were best friends, but...

00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:30,653
(groans)

00:30:30,653 --> 00:30:32,488
You know, I should've known

00:30:32,488 --> 00:30:34,590
when McQuaid said he was
quitting, that something was up.

00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:36,358
And he...

00:30:36,358 --> 00:30:38,727
he always had this weakness
when it came to beautiful women.

00:30:38,727 --> 00:30:40,663
Well, they're still out there.

00:30:40,663 --> 00:30:44,133
And like you said, they left
a trail of bodies behind them.

00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:45,534
So what do we do?

00:30:45,534 --> 00:30:47,403
When she was playing the victim,

00:30:47,403 --> 00:30:50,072
Laura Gabriel gave us
her husband's banking connection

00:30:50,072 --> 00:30:51,373
to his hit team.

00:30:51,373 --> 00:30:53,175
She was gonna use it
to set him up.

00:30:53,175 --> 00:30:54,610
Why don't we use it
to set her up?

00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:56,345
That sounds good.

00:30:56,345 --> 00:30:58,981
Good, 'cause
the next part won't.

00:31:09,491 --> 00:31:11,393
So now you want my help?

00:31:11,393 --> 00:31:14,129
That's right.

00:31:14,129 --> 00:31:16,699
Interesting choice of venue.

00:31:16,699 --> 00:31:19,234
You've been watching
too many movies.

00:31:19,234 --> 00:31:21,203
I wanted to make sure
your people weren't listening.

00:31:21,203 --> 00:31:24,340
Does that go for LVPD, too?

00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,308

00:31:26,308 --> 00:31:28,377
We're the least
of your problems.

00:31:28,377 --> 00:31:30,679
I understand I'm no longer
a person of interest,

00:31:30,679 --> 00:31:34,750
but I'd be interested
in knowing who is now.

00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:36,085
So?

00:31:36,085 --> 00:31:37,286
Your wife.

00:31:37,286 --> 00:31:38,654
PRATT:
With help

00:31:38,654 --> 00:31:40,656
from my former partner.

00:31:40,656 --> 00:31:43,392
Laura and Agent McQuaid
are dead.

00:31:43,392 --> 00:31:45,661
She played you.

00:31:47,696 --> 00:31:50,032
Impressive.

00:31:50,032 --> 00:31:53,168
Clearly my wife learned
a few things over the years.

00:31:53,168 --> 00:31:56,038
She set your own dogs on you,
and you know who they are.

00:31:56,038 --> 00:31:57,306
And how to bring them to heel.

00:31:58,607 --> 00:32:00,009
She betrayed us both.

00:32:01,443 --> 00:32:03,078
But you want this bad.

00:32:03,078 --> 00:32:04,413
I assume that's why
you're keeping company

00:32:04,413 --> 00:32:05,614
with the Boy Scout.

00:32:05,614 --> 00:32:07,182
Like the man said,
we need your help.

00:32:07,182 --> 00:32:08,684
Look...

00:32:08,684 --> 00:32:11,086
someone on your payroll knows
where Laura and McQuaid are.

00:32:15,124 --> 00:32:17,993
This has been
a helpful conversation.

00:32:17,993 --> 00:32:19,328
But I prefer

00:32:19,328 --> 00:32:21,196
to settle my own affairs.

00:32:21,196 --> 00:32:23,499
Good evening.

00:32:27,469 --> 00:32:28,971
That went well.

00:32:28,971 --> 00:32:30,706
(car doors closing)

00:32:30,706 --> 00:32:32,641
I hope so.

00:32:32,641 --> 00:32:36,311
Just hope he's not as smart
as he thinks he is.

00:32:39,748 --> 00:32:42,217

00:32:51,293 --> 00:32:54,229

(gunshot)

00:34:14,443 --> 00:34:17,112
I won't miss next time.

00:34:17,112 --> 00:34:18,213
Put the gun

00:34:18,213 --> 00:34:19,681
on the floor,

00:34:19,681 --> 00:34:21,150
and keep the hands
where we can see them.

00:34:24,386 --> 00:34:26,288
How did you find me?

00:34:26,288 --> 00:34:27,623
We just followed the money.

00:34:27,623 --> 00:34:29,491
Mark Gabriel made you
a better offer.

00:34:29,491 --> 00:34:31,260
Double the money to take
the contract off his head

00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,394
and put it
on his wife's.

00:34:32,394 --> 00:34:34,229
And Laura Gabriel...

00:34:34,229 --> 00:34:35,731
was very cooperative.

00:34:35,731 --> 00:34:40,135
When things become personal,
business always suffers.

00:34:40,135 --> 00:34:42,371
Well, our business
isn't concluded.

00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:43,405
Where's McQuaid?

00:34:43,405 --> 00:34:44,706
You don't know?

00:34:44,706 --> 00:34:46,141
(Obrecht snorts)

00:34:46,141 --> 00:34:47,543
You already have him.

00:34:53,448 --> 00:34:55,584
PRATT:
<i>Talked to McQuaid's ex-wife.</i>

00:34:55,584 --> 00:34:58,620
She still had some of
his things in the garage,
including a shaving kit.

00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:01,056
Ran the DNA, and
Obrecht was right--

00:35:01,056 --> 00:35:02,157
we do have McQuaid.

00:35:02,157 --> 00:35:05,527
Where?
In the morgue.

00:35:05,527 --> 00:35:07,229
RUSSELL:
Wha...? No, no.

00:35:07,229 --> 00:35:09,498
We... we identified
the burned body

00:35:09,498 --> 00:35:10,499
in the FBI sedan,

00:35:10,499 --> 00:35:12,201
and it wasn't him.

00:35:12,201 --> 00:35:13,735
That's not the body
I'm talking about.

00:35:13,735 --> 00:35:15,737
I'm talking about the
body that your guys found

00:35:15,737 --> 00:35:17,573
in the culvert
by her house.

00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:19,741
He was there, at my house?
The bullet that

00:35:19,741 --> 00:35:21,543
missed you was
a .40-caliber--

00:35:21,543 --> 00:35:23,545
that's the only kind of gun
McQuaid ever carried.

00:35:23,545 --> 00:35:26,248
Great. Not only
did he set me up,

00:35:26,248 --> 00:35:29,251
he tried to take
a shot at me.
RUSSELL:
Now, wait a second.

00:35:29,251 --> 00:35:32,988
The autopsy said he was hit in
the back with 5.7's, right?

00:35:32,988 --> 00:35:35,190
So he was running
towards you.

00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:37,025
You know, maybe
he didn't miss;

00:35:37,025 --> 00:35:39,428
maybe he was firing
a warning shot.

00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:41,029
He was trying
to protect you.

00:35:41,029 --> 00:35:42,531
Yeah, McQuaid got a
lot of people killed,

00:35:42,531 --> 00:35:44,700
but maybe that night, he was
trying to save someone.

00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:47,069
Why?

00:35:47,069 --> 00:35:49,371
Well, obviously,
he cared for you.

00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:58,280
Hey, wait up.

00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,514
I never got a chance
to say this,

00:35:59,514 --> 00:36:01,049
but you really
kicked ass last night.

00:36:01,049 --> 00:36:02,517
(laughs)

00:36:02,517 --> 00:36:04,052
Thanks.

00:36:04,052 --> 00:36:06,288
Listen, Russell's right.

00:36:06,288 --> 00:36:07,656
McQuaid had feelings for you.

00:36:07,656 --> 00:36:09,191
But I think there was
something else, too.

00:36:09,191 --> 00:36:13,262
I think that he saw in you
what he used to be.

00:36:13,262 --> 00:36:15,030
What was that?

00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:17,332
Someone with integrity.

00:36:17,332 --> 00:36:19,735
Someone who wouldn't give up.

00:36:19,735 --> 00:36:21,470
The kind of agent
that the Bureau needs.

00:36:25,374 --> 00:36:28,744
Are you asking me out on a
date, or offering me a job?

00:36:28,744 --> 00:36:31,480
(laughs): No, it was
a job offer, but I...

00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,449
but it's one that I really think
that you should consider.

00:36:36,251 --> 00:36:38,153
Well, I'm still on
<i>this</i> job right now.

00:36:39,421 --> 00:36:41,423
But thanks.

00:36:46,461 --> 00:36:50,065
(door opens)

00:36:50,065 --> 00:36:52,668
(door closes)

00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:55,304
I already gave my statement
to the other detectives.

00:36:55,304 --> 00:36:57,239
I just have
one question.

00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:00,142
Why me?

00:37:00,142 --> 00:37:02,110
You really have to ask?

00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:03,378
Why do you think I chose you?

00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,381
I know you.

00:37:06,381 --> 00:37:08,350
Really.

00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:09,484
How do you figure that?

00:37:15,057 --> 00:37:16,425
When we were kids,

00:37:16,425 --> 00:37:20,228
you always went for
the boy who needed you;

00:37:20,228 --> 00:37:22,664
I always went for the boy
who would give me something.

00:37:22,664 --> 00:37:25,133
Are you talking
about your husband?

00:37:25,133 --> 00:37:26,368
Or McQuaid?

00:37:26,368 --> 00:37:28,337
Both.

00:37:28,337 --> 00:37:31,473
Mark gave me a lifestyle.

00:37:31,473 --> 00:37:33,041
Worked for a while.

00:37:33,041 --> 00:37:34,276
Then it didn't.

00:37:36,044 --> 00:37:38,647
Then I met McQuaid.

00:37:38,647 --> 00:37:41,083
Investigating the gunrunning
case here in Vegas.

00:37:41,083 --> 00:37:44,219
And you saw an opportunity...
to set your husband up.

00:37:46,054 --> 00:37:47,689
To set me up.

00:37:47,689 --> 00:37:51,626
I take what I want.

00:37:51,626 --> 00:37:55,297
You put everyone else first,
because that's the easier way.

00:37:55,297 --> 00:37:58,367
You'd rather accept
the life you have...

00:37:58,367 --> 00:38:00,202
than risk having
the life you want.

00:38:03,004 --> 00:38:05,507
You're never gonna see the
outside world again, Laura.

00:38:07,275 --> 00:38:10,545
Tell me whose life
you'd rather have now.

00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,548
Oh, and...

00:38:13,548 --> 00:38:15,217
you do know me--
but not as well

00:38:15,217 --> 00:38:17,386
as you think,
because when you chose me,

00:38:17,386 --> 00:38:20,222
you should've known it
was gonna end like this.

00:38:30,432 --> 00:38:32,267
Well, we picked up Mark Gabriel

00:38:32,267 --> 00:38:33,668
on conspiracy
to murder his wife.

00:38:33,668 --> 00:38:36,037
Oh, raincoat guy
sold him out.

00:38:36,037 --> 00:38:38,340
Wanted to dodge the needle.
Wow.

00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:40,575
Guy had no problem
dealing death.

00:38:40,575 --> 00:38:42,511
It's a different story
when it's his own life
on the line, huh?

00:38:42,511 --> 00:38:44,513
(all phones beeping)

00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:03,098
Did you call a
family meeting?

00:39:03,098 --> 00:39:06,334
(chuckles):
No. No, I... No, I didn't.

00:39:06,334 --> 00:39:07,702
Catherine did.

00:39:07,702 --> 00:39:08,703
BRASS:
So...

00:39:08,703 --> 00:39:10,205
what's going on?

00:39:11,973 --> 00:39:15,277
I just wanted to say how...

00:39:15,277 --> 00:39:18,046
brilliant I think you all are...

00:39:19,481 --> 00:39:22,317
...what a great
team this is,

00:39:22,317 --> 00:39:26,188
how much I respect all of you,

00:39:26,188 --> 00:39:29,224
both as coworkers...

00:39:29,224 --> 00:39:30,992
(voice breaks):
and as friends.

00:39:32,994 --> 00:39:36,731
Well, as you all know,
there were a few changes made,

00:39:36,731 --> 00:39:38,366
a couple of months ago,
which, uh...

00:39:38,366 --> 00:39:42,070
(sighs)
initially hurt me...

00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:45,240
but, um, ultimately...

00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,075
ended up being a great thing.

00:39:49,444 --> 00:39:51,346
And, Nicky...

00:39:51,346 --> 00:39:53,715
I was so wrong
when I said

00:39:53,715 --> 00:39:56,017
that...

00:39:56,017 --> 00:39:58,987
it's been a long 19 years here

00:39:58,987 --> 00:40:01,189
in this lab...

00:40:01,189 --> 00:40:03,625
in this town.

00:40:03,625 --> 00:40:05,494
I mean, the truth is...

00:40:05,494 --> 00:40:07,596
(laughs)

00:40:07,596 --> 00:40:09,464
...it's just gone by too fast.

00:40:09,464 --> 00:40:12,334
(sighs):
But...

00:40:12,334 --> 00:40:16,171
there comes a point
in one's life in which...

00:40:16,171 --> 00:40:19,040
one feels compelled
to make a change.

00:40:20,642 --> 00:40:22,644
What are you saying?

00:40:22,644 --> 00:40:27,282
That I've been offered
another job.

00:40:27,282 --> 00:40:28,517
With the FBI.

00:40:30,085 --> 00:40:31,620
I've decided to take it.

00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:33,622
When?

00:40:33,622 --> 00:40:35,657
Well, it's
effective immediately.

00:40:35,657 --> 00:40:37,559
I...

00:40:37,559 --> 00:40:41,229
tendered my resignation.

00:40:41,229 --> 00:40:44,032
For real this time.

00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:49,538
You are all family...

00:40:49,538 --> 00:40:53,375
which is why...

00:40:53,375 --> 00:40:56,511
this is the hardest decision
I've ever made.

00:40:56,511 --> 00:41:00,348
(laughs): I mean, how could
I leave this place?

00:41:00,348 --> 00:41:04,753
How could I leave all of you?

00:41:04,753 --> 00:41:09,524
But not only
are you in great hands...

00:41:09,524 --> 00:41:11,159
but you...

00:41:11,159 --> 00:41:14,596
are a rock-solid,
bad-ass team of criminalists,

00:41:14,596 --> 00:41:17,566
and don't ever forget it.

00:41:17,566 --> 00:41:22,037
We all just love
you, Catherine.

00:41:22,037 --> 00:41:26,207
And, you know, even
though you're leaving,

00:41:26,207 --> 00:41:28,577
you'll always be here
with us, always.

00:41:28,577 --> 00:41:30,712
Yeah.

00:41:30,712 --> 00:41:32,514
STOKES:
We love you.

00:41:32,514 --> 00:41:35,116
WILLOWS (sniffling):
I love you, too.

00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:40,555
Go get 'em.

00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:50,665
♪ ♪

00:41:50,665 --> 00:41:54,035
I sat here...

00:41:54,035 --> 00:41:56,605
a very long time ago

00:41:56,605 --> 00:42:00,675
and talked about how
solving a case can...

00:42:00,675 --> 00:42:03,645
make you feel like
King Kong on cocaine.

00:42:03,645 --> 00:42:07,048
But just like any drug...

00:42:07,048 --> 00:42:10,318
it's got a dark side...

00:42:10,318 --> 00:42:13,755
and the rush is fleeting.

00:42:13,755 --> 00:42:16,057
Just like life.

00:42:17,692 --> 00:42:19,461
This is the only thing
I'm good at.

00:42:19,461 --> 00:42:21,997
Then hang on to that.

00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:24,366
But not so tight that...

00:42:24,366 --> 00:42:26,368
you let the rest slip away.

00:42:28,136 --> 00:42:31,373
I know your dad would
tell you the same thing.

00:42:31,373 --> 00:42:34,009
(phone buzzes)

00:42:36,111 --> 00:42:38,179
(beeps)

00:42:38,179 --> 00:42:40,248
(laughs):
Back to work.

00:42:40,248 --> 00:42:42,050
Go ahead.
I got this one.

00:42:43,985 --> 00:42:45,487
I got the next one.

00:42:45,487 --> 00:42:47,055
You got it.
