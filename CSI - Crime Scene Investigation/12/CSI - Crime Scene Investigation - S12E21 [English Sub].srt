00:08:33,841 --> 00:08:35,542
but his head is free...

00:08:35,542 --> 00:08:37,878
<i>the crash transfers</i>
<i>the vehicle's momentum</i>

00:08:37,878 --> 00:08:40,014
<i>to the head,</i>
<i>driving it forward.</i>

00:08:40,014 --> 00:08:42,850
<i>The neck strains</i>
<i>to hold the head back.</i>

00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:45,586
<i>Tension fractures</i>
<i>the base of the skull,</i>

00:08:45,586 --> 00:08:48,622
severing blood vessels
near the spinal cord,

00:08:48,622 --> 00:08:50,624
resulting
in massive hemorrhaging.

00:08:50,624 --> 00:08:53,027
So he was dead before
the fire got to him.

00:08:53,027 --> 00:08:55,129
Yeah, but perhaps his fate

00:08:55,129 --> 00:08:57,698
was fated by biology.

00:08:57,698 --> 00:08:59,566
What do you mean, Doc?

00:08:59,566 --> 00:09:01,535
The odd growths
on his eyelids

00:09:03,604 --> 00:09:04,805
and in his brain,

00:09:04,805 --> 00:09:06,740
they present like

00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:09,743
Urbach-Wiethe disease,
a rare genetic disorder

00:09:09,743 --> 00:09:11,845
that causes waxy obstructions

00:09:11,845 --> 00:09:13,147
to grow throughout
the body.

00:09:13,147 --> 00:09:15,049
Wow. That sounds
horrifying.

00:09:15,049 --> 00:09:16,850
Not to him.

00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:18,619
In our young man's case,

00:09:18,619 --> 00:09:19,953
the growths

00:09:19,953 --> 00:09:20,988
surround the amygdala.

00:09:20,988 --> 00:09:22,489
The region of the brain

00:09:22,489 --> 00:09:24,491
controlling memory
and emotional response.

00:09:24,491 --> 00:09:25,893
I read a study

00:09:25,893 --> 00:09:27,661
where obstructions of
the amygdala

00:09:27,661 --> 00:09:31,565
resulted in a patient being
absolutely fearless.

00:09:31,565 --> 00:09:34,735
Not a bad trade for a guy
with a need for speed.

00:09:34,735 --> 00:09:36,603
Except when
it gets you killed.

00:09:38,439 --> 00:09:40,507
Okay, so I'll do it
at your place tonight.

00:09:40,507 --> 00:09:43,444
And, um, I'll call you
if I'm gonna be late.

00:09:43,444 --> 00:09:46,814
Oh, there is no way that I would
ever let you go to sleep.

00:09:46,814 --> 00:09:49,049
(laughs)

00:09:49,049 --> 00:09:51,085
Oh, my goodness.

00:09:51,085 --> 00:09:52,753
Can I call you back?

00:09:52,753 --> 00:09:54,555
Oh, I'm so sorry.

00:09:54,555 --> 00:09:56,690
That is really embarrassing.
Don't be embarrassed.

00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:58,158
I'm just glad
someone around here

00:09:58,158 --> 00:09:59,960
is having a personal life.

00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,428
Really?

00:10:01,428 --> 00:10:03,030
Aren't you going out with Greg?

00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,798
Oh, no.
(chuckles)

00:10:04,798 --> 00:10:06,500
Nick?

00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,534
(sighs)
No.

00:10:07,534 --> 00:10:09,436
You're with Hodges.

00:10:09,436 --> 00:10:10,404
No.

00:10:12,773 --> 00:10:15,109
So that phone call,
that was...

00:10:15,109 --> 00:10:17,778
Detective Moreno?

00:10:17,778 --> 00:10:19,847
Oh, that is a definite yes.

00:10:19,847 --> 00:10:20,948
(laughs quietly)

00:10:20,948 --> 00:10:22,549
All right then.

00:10:22,549 --> 00:10:24,918
Well, since we're
on the subject of men,

00:10:24,918 --> 00:10:26,687
what do you say we try
and identify

00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,956
Racer X?

00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:34,795
So we start by cleaning up
the smeared logo.

00:10:36,597 --> 00:10:40,033
Then apply edge detection.

00:10:43,437 --> 00:10:45,105
It's military.

00:10:45,105 --> 00:10:47,040
Okay, let's see
if he's in that battalion.

00:10:53,814 --> 00:10:56,483
Top row, second
from the right.

00:10:56,483 --> 00:10:58,485
Looks like our vic.

00:10:58,485 --> 00:11:00,988
FINLAY: <i>The dead driver's name</i>
<i>is Jack Breslin.</i>

00:11:00,988 --> 00:11:03,123
25, from Mesquite.
Served in Iraq.

00:11:03,123 --> 00:11:05,626
Two tours.
Bronze Star.

00:11:05,626 --> 00:11:07,494
He's a regular war hero.

00:11:07,494 --> 00:11:09,763
Yeah, we're trying to
locate his next of kin.

00:11:09,763 --> 00:11:11,398
But we did locate
his apartment.

00:11:11,398 --> 00:11:13,767
Find anything?
Uh, not in the
apartment.

00:11:13,767 --> 00:11:16,937
But we were able to find a
very interesting voice mail.

00:11:16,937 --> 00:11:19,106
MAN:
Jack, listen, they're onto us.

00:11:19,106 --> 00:11:22,075
We're not going to be able
to pull this off. Walk away.

00:11:22,075 --> 00:11:23,710
Don't get into that truck.

00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:25,045
Sorry, man.

00:11:25,045 --> 00:11:26,513
Ran a trace.

00:11:26,513 --> 00:11:28,148
Call came
from a disposable phone.

00:11:28,148 --> 00:11:30,150
According to the phone company's
server,

00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,618
this was the last message

00:11:31,618 --> 00:11:32,786
left on Breslin's
voice mail.

00:11:32,786 --> 00:11:34,555
I'm betting he never got it.

00:11:39,593 --> 00:11:41,628
What are you doing,
homework?

00:11:41,628 --> 00:11:42,996
You know I've been studying

00:11:42,996 --> 00:11:45,866
for my criminalistics
certification.

00:11:45,866 --> 00:11:47,768
I never really liked math
in school,

00:11:47,768 --> 00:11:49,736
but you throw in
a little ballistics,

00:11:49,736 --> 00:11:52,706
some TNT, bit of blood--
it's pretty cool.

00:11:52,706 --> 00:11:55,976
Cool. But shouldn't you be doing
that on your own time?

00:11:55,976 --> 00:11:59,046
I'm actually working the case.

00:11:59,046 --> 00:12:01,682
And I think that we're looking
at it all wrong.

00:12:01,682 --> 00:12:03,450
Cite your source.

00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:05,819
The debris field.

00:12:05,819 --> 00:12:08,021
It's way too big
for an accidental explosion,

00:12:08,021 --> 00:12:09,623
like you
theorized.

00:12:09,623 --> 00:12:10,824
No offense.

00:12:10,824 --> 00:12:13,493
None taken...
if you're right.

00:12:13,493 --> 00:12:14,962
Well, based on

00:12:14,962 --> 00:12:18,565
the size and direction of
impact to the fuel tank,

00:12:18,565 --> 00:12:21,101
we're looking at a
seriously big bang.

00:12:21,101 --> 00:12:22,970
First calculation.

00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:26,840
I estimated that at least 25
hundred mega joules of energy

00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,141
were released
by that blast.

00:12:28,141 --> 00:12:30,611
That is a lot more
than just fuel igniting.

00:12:30,611 --> 00:12:32,379
Sounds like an explosive.

00:12:32,379 --> 00:12:35,616
Which would explain
the indentation to the

00:12:35,616 --> 00:12:37,884
bottom of the fuel tank.

00:12:37,884 --> 00:12:39,586
(engine revving)

00:12:39,586 --> 00:12:41,555
<i>The explosion goes out</i>
<i>in all directions.</i>

00:12:41,555 --> 00:12:43,924
<i>Upward causing</i>
<i>the tank to indent,</i>

00:12:43,924 --> 00:12:45,993
<i>and downward sending</i>
<i>the initiator and switch</i>

00:12:45,993 --> 00:12:48,595
<i>into the ground at the point</i>
<i>of detonation.</i>

00:12:48,595 --> 00:12:52,766
Now, the crime scene sketches
show the distribution of debris

00:12:52,766 --> 00:12:57,471
extending out about 200 feet
in a roughly conical pattern.

00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:00,707
So the truck-- it's
moving at 80 miles per hour.

00:13:00,707 --> 00:13:05,979
That's about 117
feet per second.

00:13:05,979 --> 00:13:07,080
Oh.

00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,516
Don't patronize me, mathlete.

00:13:09,516 --> 00:13:11,551
The truck's momentum

00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:13,787
would have given all
of this debris

00:13:13,787 --> 00:13:16,490
an extra hundred
or so feet of flight,

00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:18,625
putting the actual point
of detonation...

00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:20,127
A hundred feet back.
Here.

00:13:20,127 --> 00:13:21,695
Explains why
we didn't find

00:13:21,695 --> 00:13:23,063
an initiator
or a switch at the scene.

00:13:23,063 --> 00:13:25,032
They were buried back there.

00:13:25,032 --> 00:13:27,367
Want to test
your big bang theory?

00:13:50,924 --> 00:13:54,895
♪ ♪

00:14:03,704 --> 00:14:06,640
(beeping)

00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,575
Nitroglycerine residue.

00:14:08,575 --> 00:14:10,777
Dynamite. Plus all that gas.

00:14:10,777 --> 00:14:12,779
That's one hell of a bomb.

00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:14,781
Good call.
Mm. Thank Russell.

00:14:14,781 --> 00:14:17,451
He's the one who pushed me
to get my IAI certification.

00:14:17,451 --> 00:14:20,787
So, we're looking
for a bomb, but why?

00:14:20,787 --> 00:14:24,458
I mean, it's not like the Desert
Blast 200 is the Indy 500.

00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:26,626
A bunch of weekend
warriors out in the desert.

00:14:26,626 --> 00:14:28,428
I just don't see them
killing each other.

00:14:28,428 --> 00:14:30,664
Maybe it's not about
the race itself,

00:14:30,664 --> 00:14:32,666
but who's in the race.

00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:34,668
We need
to find those bomb components.

00:14:34,668 --> 00:14:36,069
I'll grab Morgan.

00:14:36,069 --> 00:14:38,004
Go back to the crash site
and start digging.

00:14:42,376 --> 00:14:43,977
BRODY:
I feel like my grandfather.

00:14:43,977 --> 00:14:46,646
All I need are a pair
of suspenders

00:14:46,646 --> 00:14:48,548
and an egg salad sandwich.

00:14:48,548 --> 00:14:51,785
Only we're not looking
for watches and gold doubloons.

00:14:51,785 --> 00:14:54,020
I know. We're looking
for a detonator.

00:14:55,555 --> 00:14:57,391
(detector clicking,
buzzing loudly)

00:14:59,426 --> 00:15:00,994
Huh.

00:15:02,763 --> 00:15:03,964
Beer can pop-top.

00:15:03,964 --> 00:15:05,365
BRODY:
Keep digging.

00:15:05,365 --> 00:15:06,400
See if you can find
the rest of it.

00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,667
I could use a beer right now.

00:15:07,667 --> 00:15:08,835
I'll buy you a beer
when we're done.

00:15:08,835 --> 00:15:10,537
How about that?

00:15:10,537 --> 00:15:12,706
Unless you and Hodges
and Mrs. Hodges have plans.

00:15:12,706 --> 00:15:15,542
Try my dad and Mrs. Hodges.

00:15:15,542 --> 00:15:16,643
(detector clicking)

00:15:20,046 --> 00:15:22,883
(clicking, buzzing loudly)

00:15:27,454 --> 00:15:28,822
Ha-ho, look at this.

00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:33,994
Different kind of pop-top.
Detonator.

00:15:33,994 --> 00:15:36,863
Wow. It's an RF receiver.

00:15:36,863 --> 00:15:39,599
Says that this bomb
was detonated remotely.

00:15:39,599 --> 00:15:42,135
You know, whoever built this
thing had some expertise.

00:15:42,135 --> 00:15:45,772
And it means they could have
set it off from a distance.

00:15:48,475 --> 00:15:50,043
What you got there?

00:15:50,043 --> 00:15:51,978
Metal frag.

00:15:53,547 --> 00:15:56,016
Has some kind of serial number.

00:15:56,016 --> 00:15:58,485
No. Looks more
like a VIN number.

00:15:58,485 --> 00:16:00,120
Judging from the size,

00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,055
I don't think
it's part of the bomb.

00:16:02,055 --> 00:16:03,690
Well, maybe from
the truck.

00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:06,626
Oh, I found so many

00:16:06,626 --> 00:16:08,695
cannibalized parts on that rig.

00:16:08,695 --> 00:16:11,364
I ran all the numbers,
didn't get any leads.

00:16:11,364 --> 00:16:13,600
Well, maybe
this is the lucky number.

00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,901
I hope you're right.

00:16:14,901 --> 00:16:16,503
Have a little faith.

00:16:16,503 --> 00:16:18,705
And you still owe me a beer.

00:16:22,142 --> 00:16:23,510
SIDLE:
<i>Mr. Weber,</i>

00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:24,845
this is your truck, right?

00:16:24,845 --> 00:16:28,515
Yeah.

00:16:28,515 --> 00:16:30,050
What's this about?

00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:32,519
We found a fragment
of an oil pan out in the desert.

00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:34,654
It was part of
a racing truck.

00:16:34,654 --> 00:16:36,656
But based on the VIN number,
we believe

00:16:36,656 --> 00:16:39,659
that that pan started its life
under your vehicle.

00:16:39,659 --> 00:16:42,128
Racing truck?
You got to be kidding me.
No.

00:16:42,128 --> 00:16:44,564
Any idea
how that might have happened?

00:16:44,564 --> 00:16:47,000
(sighs)

00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,536
You're not gonna believe this.

00:16:49,536 --> 00:16:50,637
Try me.

00:16:50,637 --> 00:16:52,572
A month back,

00:16:52,572 --> 00:16:54,374
I was at Desert Palm Hospital.

00:16:54,374 --> 00:16:55,675
My wife...

00:16:55,675 --> 00:16:58,078
Well... she passed.

00:16:58,078 --> 00:16:59,546
Cancer.

00:16:59,546 --> 00:17:01,081
I'm so sorry.

00:17:01,081 --> 00:17:04,951
Left me with a broken heart,
and a hell of a bill.

00:17:04,951 --> 00:17:07,921
I've been trying to work
something out with the hospital.

00:17:07,921 --> 00:17:11,691
Anyway, I came out
and found my truck leaking oil,

00:17:11,691 --> 00:17:13,093
bad enough I
couldn't drive it.

00:17:13,093 --> 00:17:14,728
I knew I couldn't
afford to fix it.

00:17:14,728 --> 00:17:16,129
That's when
these fellows came up.

00:17:16,129 --> 00:17:17,497
Who?

00:17:17,497 --> 00:17:19,032
I'd never seen 'em before.

00:17:19,032 --> 00:17:21,001
They checked under the hood.

00:17:21,001 --> 00:17:23,570
Bad fuel pump and

00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:26,373
a leaking oil pan,
they said.

00:17:26,373 --> 00:17:30,544
They went
and bought me a new one.

00:17:30,544 --> 00:17:31,645
Just like that?

00:17:31,645 --> 00:17:33,613
It's crazy, I know.

00:17:33,613 --> 00:17:35,882
Just like those Good Samaritans
who pay off people's

00:17:35,882 --> 00:17:37,551
layaways at Christmas.

00:17:37,551 --> 00:17:42,088
By chance... is this one
of the Samaritans?

00:17:42,088 --> 00:17:43,590
Yeah.

00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:45,592
Uh, there was
another guy with him.

00:17:45,592 --> 00:17:47,527
Um, wore glasses.

00:17:47,527 --> 00:17:49,095
While the fellow
with the glasses

00:17:49,095 --> 00:17:50,630
was working
on the engine, this...

00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:52,065
this guy said something
kind of weird.

00:17:53,533 --> 00:17:55,001
A lot of bad
in this world.

00:17:55,001 --> 00:17:56,670
But we're trying
to make something good.

00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:58,471
And, sir, we're gonna

00:17:58,471 --> 00:18:00,707
make you part of something
really special.

00:18:01,975 --> 00:18:04,945
These guys have a name?

00:18:04,945 --> 00:18:07,547
No, they never said.

00:18:07,547 --> 00:18:09,649
(sighs)

00:18:09,649 --> 00:18:11,685
Times have been kind of
tough lately.

00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,722
What they did

00:18:15,722 --> 00:18:18,425
was the first true kindness
to come my way in a while.

00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:22,395
These boys didn't
do any harm, did they?

00:18:22,395 --> 00:18:24,965
Oh, I-I don't think so,
but I'm afraid

00:18:24,965 --> 00:18:27,500
that harm may have found them.

00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,102
Oh, hey, I have
something for you.

00:18:29,102 --> 00:18:30,570
Ooh. Whoa. (laughs)

00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:31,838
What is that?

00:18:31,838 --> 00:18:32,839
What is... what is what?

00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:35,709
That...

00:18:35,709 --> 00:18:36,977
scent.
Oh.

00:18:36,977 --> 00:18:40,080
It's my new musk.
Rosa Misteriosa.

00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,016
Right. Your Italian kick.

00:18:43,016 --> 00:18:44,718
It's like a boot to the nose.

00:18:44,718 --> 00:18:45,719
Too much?

00:18:45,719 --> 00:18:46,920
Yeah.
Huh.

00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,121
There are some
women who like it.

00:18:48,121 --> 00:18:49,723
Are we talking
about your mother?

00:18:49,723 --> 00:18:51,591
We are talking about
none of your business.

00:18:51,591 --> 00:18:53,159
So, I was able to track down

00:18:53,159 --> 00:18:55,495
the RF receiver that you and
Greg found at the crash site.

00:18:55,495 --> 00:18:56,730
It's a fairly
common component

00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:58,465
in do-it-yourself
household devices,

00:18:58,465 --> 00:19:00,467
like doorbells
or garage door openers.

00:19:00,467 --> 00:19:02,035
Too common to trace.

00:19:02,035 --> 00:19:05,872
Yes. However, the tire treads
from the vehicle that drove over

00:19:05,872 --> 00:19:07,741
the debris at the crash site,
those treads are unique.

00:19:07,741 --> 00:19:09,442
It's a Minooka Tires model

00:19:09,442 --> 00:19:11,611
that hasn't yet been
commercially released.

00:19:11,611 --> 00:19:13,580
Only demo'd to a few
select racing teams.

00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,849
Look at the name at
the bottom of the list.

00:19:15,849 --> 00:19:18,885
"Veck Oil Race Team,"
as in Kathy Veck.

00:19:18,885 --> 00:19:20,420
Russell told me about her.

00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,688
Hmm.

00:19:21,688 --> 00:19:22,889
Hope he's got

00:19:22,889 --> 00:19:24,491
his seatbelt fastened.

00:19:24,491 --> 00:19:28,028
Ms. Veck, you said that

00:19:28,028 --> 00:19:30,664
you were ahead
of the Pharaoh's Motorists truck

00:19:30,664 --> 00:19:32,599
when it crashed,
is that right?

00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:33,900
Yes, that is right.

00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,002
Are you sure about that?

00:19:36,002 --> 00:19:38,972
Because the evidence says
that you were behind it,

00:19:38,972 --> 00:19:41,908
and that you didn't even stop
to lend them a hand.

00:19:41,908 --> 00:19:43,743
You just drove right on by.

00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:47,047
Well, maybe I was mistaken
in my first recollection.

00:19:47,047 --> 00:19:50,016
Well, why don't you tell me
what did happen, then?

00:19:50,016 --> 00:19:54,754
Okay, look, uh...
I barely saw the fire

00:19:54,754 --> 00:19:57,590
<i>through the dust</i>
<i>and the heat of the race,</i>

00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:59,392
<i>and I figured,</i>
<i>whoever they were,</i>

00:19:59,392 --> 00:20:01,661
<i>they would be all right.</i>

00:20:01,661 --> 00:20:03,430
(engine revving)

00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:06,032
And what the heck.
You'd be in first place, right?

00:20:06,032 --> 00:20:08,535
Racing is a dangerous sport,
Mr. Russell, okay?

00:20:08,535 --> 00:20:10,470
Accidents happen.

00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:12,505
Are you accusing me
of something?

00:20:12,505 --> 00:20:14,541
You lied about where you were
and what you saw.

00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:16,609
It makes me wonder what else
you might have lied about.

00:20:16,609 --> 00:20:19,079
Like eliminating
the competition maybe?

00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:20,880
(laughing):
Competition?

00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,816
You're talking about
a rookie race team

00:20:22,816 --> 00:20:24,417
no one's ever heard of,

00:20:24,417 --> 00:20:26,820
driving a junkyard
mess of spare parts.

00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:29,389
I thought you were just accusing
me of bad sportsmanship.

00:20:29,389 --> 00:20:30,790
You're talking about,
what, sabotage now?

00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:32,592
No, actually,
much more than that.

00:20:32,592 --> 00:20:34,828
I'm talking about placing a bomb

00:20:34,828 --> 00:20:36,730
in a racing truck, and then,

00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:37,997
detonating it remotely.

00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:45,438
Look, I don't know who those
Pharaoh boys were, okay?

00:20:45,438 --> 00:20:47,607
But if anyone
had a target on their back

00:20:47,607 --> 00:20:49,008
in that race, it was me.

00:20:49,008 --> 00:20:50,810
And why do you think that?

00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:52,011
I run a petroleum
company, okay?

00:20:52,011 --> 00:20:53,546
I've got lots of enemies.

00:20:53,546 --> 00:20:54,948
Earth-liberators,

00:20:54,948 --> 00:20:56,649
big-oil haters.

00:20:56,649 --> 00:20:58,718
People who hate paying
at the pump, you name it.

00:20:58,718 --> 00:21:01,454
Well, I'm in law enforcement.
A lot of people hate me, too.

00:21:03,523 --> 00:21:05,992
Do they send you a
hundred of these a day?

00:21:08,595 --> 00:21:09,562
(sighing)

00:21:09,562 --> 00:21:11,965
I decided a long time ago

00:21:11,965 --> 00:21:13,566
not to give them
the satisfaction

00:21:13,566 --> 00:21:14,834
of running and hiding.

00:21:14,834 --> 00:21:16,569
Screw 'em.

00:21:16,569 --> 00:21:18,905
RUSSELL:
<i>"You Veck Oil bitch.</i>

00:21:18,905 --> 00:21:20,573
"One thing certain
is death and taxes,

00:21:20,573 --> 00:21:22,675
"but since you don't pay taxes,
the only thing

00:21:22,675 --> 00:21:24,444
certain for you is death."

00:21:24,444 --> 00:21:26,379
"You destroyed my life,
and now I'm going

00:21:26,379 --> 00:21:28,081
"to soak you
in your own oil...
Ooh.

00:21:28,081 --> 00:21:29,749
...and light a match."

00:21:29,749 --> 00:21:31,551
Kind of reminds me of
the e-mails I used to get

00:21:31,551 --> 00:21:33,520
from my third wife.
I mean, come on, it's horrible,

00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,588
but is it credible?
Well, it's credible

00:21:35,588 --> 00:21:37,657
enough to look into,
don't you think?

00:21:37,657 --> 00:21:40,493
I mean, you got three guys
who show up out of nowhere,

00:21:40,493 --> 00:21:41,895
using aliases,

00:21:41,895 --> 00:21:44,798
calling themselves some
vaguely Middle Eastern name.

00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:47,100
And they got a bomb
strapped to their truck.

00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,602
Wait a minute-- you think
these guys are terrorists?

00:21:49,602 --> 00:21:51,437
Well, domestic, maybe.

00:21:51,437 --> 00:21:54,007
I mean, it fits the message
they sent to the driver.

00:21:54,007 --> 00:21:57,043
"Walk away. We're not going
to be able to pull this off."

00:21:57,043 --> 00:21:58,645
Sounds to me
like someone's trying

00:21:58,645 --> 00:22:01,381
to abort the mission,
doesn't it?

00:22:01,381 --> 00:22:03,049
We get anything else
off that voice mail?

00:22:03,049 --> 00:22:04,784
Henry's working on it.

00:22:04,784 --> 00:22:07,153
MAN:
Jack, listen, they're onto us.

00:22:07,153 --> 00:22:09,923
We're not going to be able
to pull this off. Walk awa--

00:22:09,923 --> 00:22:11,124
(audio rewinds)

00:22:11,124 --> 00:22:13,459
Jack, listen, they're onto us.

00:22:13,459 --> 00:22:14,828
Jack, listen...

00:22:24,637 --> 00:22:26,372
ANDREWS:
<i>I dug out the background audio</i>

00:22:26,372 --> 00:22:27,907
in the voice mail;
I thought it might help us

00:22:27,907 --> 00:22:29,776
pin down a location
of the anonymous caller.

00:22:29,776 --> 00:22:31,611
MAN: Athrok, we're
running out of time!

00:22:31,611 --> 00:22:33,847
To the fire service cave! Now!

00:22:33,847 --> 00:22:37,483
<i>Athrok the Conqueror,</i>
that dragon movie.

00:22:37,483 --> 00:22:39,052
You know it's not
in theaters anymore,

00:22:39,052 --> 00:22:40,587
and I'm pretty sure
it didn't come out on DVD

00:22:40,587 --> 00:22:41,821
because I wanted to see that.

00:22:41,821 --> 00:22:44,157
Wait, you-you like
fantasy movies?

00:22:44,157 --> 00:22:46,726
Yeah. I saw <i>Lord of</i>
<i>the Rings,</i> like, 40 times.

00:22:46,726 --> 00:22:49,596
That's awesome.

00:22:49,596 --> 00:22:52,031
Okay, now, I called around
and <i>Athrok</i> is currently on

00:22:52,031 --> 00:22:54,067
just one video-on-demand service

00:22:54,067 --> 00:22:56,069
used by only ten
Vegas hotels.

00:22:56,069 --> 00:22:58,671
Voice mail came in
at 8:17 p.m..

00:22:58,671 --> 00:23:00,607
Yeah, only one hotel had
a customer rent the film

00:23:00,607 --> 00:23:01,641
at that time.

00:23:01,641 --> 00:23:03,042
Bridgemoor Hotel, Room 20.

00:23:03,042 --> 00:23:05,578
So the room is registered
under the same fake name

00:23:05,578 --> 00:23:07,614
as the captain of the
Pharaoh's Motorists team,

00:23:07,614 --> 00:23:08,615
Doug White.

00:23:08,615 --> 00:23:10,917
He paid in cash, and this is it.

00:23:12,685 --> 00:23:14,554
LVPD! Open up!

00:23:15,622 --> 00:23:16,823
(beeping)

00:23:24,831 --> 00:23:26,132
Bathroom's clear.

00:23:26,132 --> 00:23:27,500
Yeah, it's clear
out here.

00:23:29,102 --> 00:23:31,604
FINLAY:
Ah, pictures of Kathy Veck.

00:23:31,604 --> 00:23:33,439
Maybe some other targets, too.

00:23:35,808 --> 00:23:37,043
VARTANN:
We got a Malcolm Platt.

00:23:39,445 --> 00:23:41,014
"Clive Morris."

00:23:41,014 --> 00:23:42,849
Our other two White brothers.

00:23:42,849 --> 00:23:44,884
Look at this.

00:23:44,884 --> 00:23:46,986
U.S. Army Field Manual,

00:23:46,986 --> 00:23:48,988
<i>Anarchist Cookbook,</i>

00:23:48,988 --> 00:23:51,391
<i>Guide to</i>
<i>U.S. Government Facilities.</i>

00:23:51,391 --> 00:23:52,959
Guess these guys are serious.

00:23:52,959 --> 00:23:55,161
(clattering)

00:23:55,161 --> 00:23:56,996
I thought you said
it was clear.
It was.

00:23:56,996 --> 00:23:58,097
(guns cocking)

00:24:02,101 --> 00:24:03,770
Well, this is a new one.

00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:05,438
Usually we gotta stop them
from going out the window.

00:24:05,438 --> 00:24:07,373
Get up.

00:24:07,373 --> 00:24:09,108
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

00:24:09,108 --> 00:24:11,444
Right here.

00:24:11,444 --> 00:24:14,580
Let's see which
White brother we got.

00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,915
"Clive Morris."

00:24:15,915 --> 00:24:17,784
My name doesn't matter.

00:24:17,784 --> 00:24:19,686
There are more just like me.

00:24:22,455 --> 00:24:24,057
You'll never stop us all.

00:24:36,869 --> 00:24:38,638
SIDLE:
Looks like Kathy Veck

00:24:38,638 --> 00:24:41,474
isn't the only one
you have issues with, Clive.

00:24:41,474 --> 00:24:43,977
You have no right
to these documents.

00:24:43,977 --> 00:24:45,979
Clive, we know
where Jack is.

00:24:45,979 --> 00:24:47,880
Wh-wh-where's Malcolm?

00:24:49,515 --> 00:24:50,817
Clive?

00:24:50,817 --> 00:24:52,685
You said there were others
out there like you.

00:24:52,685 --> 00:24:53,820
Where's Malcolm?

00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,955
SIDLE: What are
you all planning?

00:24:55,955 --> 00:24:57,090
Another attack?

00:24:57,090 --> 00:24:59,959
Whatever the battle calls for.

00:24:59,959 --> 00:25:00,994
RUSSELL:
I'm sorry.

00:25:00,994 --> 00:25:02,161
What battle is that again?

00:25:04,397 --> 00:25:06,733
I stand in solidarity
with all people targeted

00:25:06,733 --> 00:25:09,802
by government control
and economic violence.

00:25:09,802 --> 00:25:11,838
SIDLE:
What about Jack Breslin?

00:25:11,838 --> 00:25:14,774
Did he stand with you
before he blew himself up?

00:25:16,976 --> 00:25:19,812
I know you have cameras
taping this.

00:25:19,812 --> 00:25:22,648
They're for your protection,
Clive, and ours.

00:25:26,686 --> 00:25:28,788
I like your glasses.

00:25:28,788 --> 00:25:30,456
Thank you.

00:25:30,456 --> 00:25:32,725
Yeah, my, uh,

00:25:32,725 --> 00:25:33,993
my wife helped me
pick these out.

00:25:35,895 --> 00:25:38,431
Do you wear glasses, Clive?

00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,768
Don't need them.

00:25:41,768 --> 00:25:43,102
SIDLE:
Glad we got that straight.

00:25:43,102 --> 00:25:45,104
Look, I get it.

00:25:45,104 --> 00:25:48,041
Veck Oil are Earth vampires,
and your mission...

00:25:48,041 --> 00:25:50,510
Oh, so you know what's going on
inside my mind now,

00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:52,111
do you?

00:25:52,111 --> 00:25:54,113
I know what you're doing.

00:25:54,113 --> 00:25:57,417
I know who you are,

00:25:57,417 --> 00:25:59,986
and I'm done talking.

00:25:59,986 --> 00:26:02,655
SANDERS:
<i>I can't tell you what's going</i>
<i>on inside Clive Morris's mind,</i>

00:26:02,655 --> 00:26:04,957
but I can tell you what's
going on inside his laptop.

00:26:04,957 --> 00:26:07,727
I pulled some of these images
from his hard drive,

00:26:07,727 --> 00:26:09,095
the rest are
from the motel room.

00:26:09,095 --> 00:26:10,730
Pictures of the municipal court,

00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:13,433
Federal Building, City Hall...

00:26:13,433 --> 00:26:14,700
Kathy Veck.

00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,569
These guys entered
the race anonymous

00:26:16,569 --> 00:26:18,538
looking for an opportunity
to blow her up.

00:26:18,538 --> 00:26:21,374
Yeah, well, good plan,
bad execution.

00:26:21,374 --> 00:26:22,775
SANDERS: Driver's dead,
co-driver's missing.

00:26:22,775 --> 00:26:23,910
You think it was Clive?

00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:25,078
No, it can't be Clive.

00:26:25,078 --> 00:26:26,679
He has no injuries,

00:26:26,679 --> 00:26:28,848
and he tested negative
for any bomb residue.

00:26:28,848 --> 00:26:30,483
So the co-driver's
still out there,

00:26:30,483 --> 00:26:33,486
hopefully not
shifting their focus

00:26:33,486 --> 00:26:34,887
from a rich CEO
to other targets.

00:26:34,887 --> 00:26:36,155
Big, bad government.

00:26:36,155 --> 00:26:38,024
You know, I'm not buying
any of this.

00:26:38,024 --> 00:26:39,759
Really? You're the one

00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:41,828
who brought up this whole
domestic terrorist theory.

00:26:41,828 --> 00:26:44,697
I know, but we-we processed
that entire motel room.

00:26:44,697 --> 00:26:46,966
We didn't find
any trace of nitrates,

00:26:46,966 --> 00:26:48,868
we didn't find
any bomb-making material.

00:26:48,868 --> 00:26:51,471
Well, maybe their bomb factory
was someplace else.

00:26:51,471 --> 00:26:53,739
You know, I'm beginning to think
their heads are someplace else.

00:26:53,739 --> 00:26:55,541
Clive Morris asked me

00:26:55,541 --> 00:26:56,876
about my-my glasses.

00:26:56,876 --> 00:26:58,111
So?

00:26:58,111 --> 00:26:59,479
It was the way he asked me.

00:26:59,479 --> 00:27:01,147
You know, it was like...

00:27:01,147 --> 00:27:04,484
A-Anyway, look, I've known a few
revolutionaries in my time,

00:27:04,484 --> 00:27:06,419
true believers,

00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:08,020
all anger, no fear.

00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:11,090
With Clive Morris,
it was just about the opposite.

00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:12,758
Because he's paranoid.

00:27:12,758 --> 00:27:14,760
I ran him through
missing persons.

00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,629
Turns out he wandered off
from Desert Palm

00:27:16,629 --> 00:27:18,764
where he was being treated for
paranoid personality disorder,

00:27:18,764 --> 00:27:21,367
and he wasn't alone.

00:27:21,367 --> 00:27:23,870
Malcolm Platt is also
AWOL from the psych ward,

00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:26,572
and Jack Breslin was
an out-patient.

00:27:28,608 --> 00:27:30,776
DR. BERKMAN:
<i>They called themselves</i>
<i>"The Three Musketeers."</i>

00:27:30,776 --> 00:27:32,545
They met here
in group therapy,

00:27:32,545 --> 00:27:34,647
as part of our
treatment program.

00:27:34,647 --> 00:27:36,482
SIDLE: What can you tell me
about them?

00:27:36,482 --> 00:27:38,784
Jack Breslin was
a decorated war hero.

00:27:38,784 --> 00:27:40,920
The very thing that
made him a great soldier

00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,890
is what made his reentry into
civilian life so difficult.

00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:46,792
Urbach-Wiethe syndrome,
predisposition towards
reckless behavior.

00:27:46,792 --> 00:27:48,094
Yes.

00:27:48,094 --> 00:27:50,630
Clive Morris was
the exact opposite,

00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:53,099
consumed by fear, paranoia.

00:27:53,099 --> 00:27:55,034
The courts referred him to me
five months ago.

00:27:55,034 --> 00:27:57,737
Police say he's led them on a
number of high-speed car chases?

00:27:57,737 --> 00:28:00,406
Clive believed he was being
followed by the CIA,

00:28:00,406 --> 00:28:03,009
the FBI, the usual
paranoid fantasies.

00:28:03,009 --> 00:28:05,044
What about, uh,
Malcolm Platt?

00:28:05,044 --> 00:28:07,046
What's his diagnosis?

00:28:07,046 --> 00:28:08,481
Malcolm is schizophrenic.

00:28:08,481 --> 00:28:10,383
Suffers delusions of grandeur.

00:28:10,383 --> 00:28:11,717
Is he dangerous?

00:28:11,717 --> 00:28:15,655
I would describe him
more as, uh... volatile.

00:28:15,655 --> 00:28:17,023
When the three of them
were together,

00:28:17,023 --> 00:28:19,058
did they ever discuss
acts of violence?

00:28:19,058 --> 00:28:20,459
Oh, hardly.

00:28:20,459 --> 00:28:22,161
They all shared one love.

00:28:22,161 --> 00:28:23,462
What's that?

00:28:23,462 --> 00:28:24,897
Auto racing.

00:28:24,897 --> 00:28:27,767
<i>Every weekend, without fail,</i>

00:28:27,767 --> 00:28:29,569
<i>The Three Musketeers would</i>
<i>get together</i>

00:28:29,569 --> 00:28:31,037
<i>for popcorn and a race,</i>
<i>cheering on their favorites.</i>

00:28:31,037 --> 00:28:32,371
Whoo!

00:28:32,371 --> 00:28:34,373
(laughing, whooping)

00:28:34,373 --> 00:28:37,677
I asked Clive once why
he liked racing so much.

00:28:37,677 --> 00:28:39,078
He said, "Where else

00:28:39,078 --> 00:28:41,080
can a bunch of mechanics
become heroes?"

00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,616
Do you think Clive is
the leader of the group?

00:28:43,616 --> 00:28:45,051
Clive? No.

00:28:45,051 --> 00:28:47,086
Malcolm was the one
always leading the charge.

00:28:47,086 --> 00:28:48,888
Yeah, we've been looking
for him.

00:28:48,888 --> 00:28:50,556
Any idea where he might be?

00:28:50,556 --> 00:28:52,058
All I know is Malcolm's mother

00:28:52,058 --> 00:28:53,726
said he called her
two days ago

00:28:53,726 --> 00:28:55,061
from a pay phone,

00:28:55,061 --> 00:28:56,796
told her he was
on some kind of mission.

00:28:58,397 --> 00:28:59,865
I pulled Malcolm Platt's
rap sheet.

00:28:59,865 --> 00:29:02,001
I'd say volatile is
putting it mildly.

00:29:02,001 --> 00:29:04,804
Three attempted auto thefts,
three attempted assaults.

00:29:04,804 --> 00:29:07,840
The guy has delusions of being
rich and owning fast cars.

00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,542
He walks into a dealership,
grabs a key

00:29:09,542 --> 00:29:12,378
and conducts his own
grand-theft test drive.

00:29:12,378 --> 00:29:13,946
That's a good way
to avoid haggling, right?

00:29:13,946 --> 00:29:17,984
Yeah, until the salesperson
tries to stop you.

00:29:17,984 --> 00:29:20,152
Are you playing hangman?

00:29:20,152 --> 00:29:24,090
No, no,
more like a brain teaser.

00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:27,093
"A Pharaoh's Motorists."

00:29:27,093 --> 00:29:29,462
The "A" at the beginning
was bothering me,

00:29:29,462 --> 00:29:31,764
so I started rearranging
the letters.

00:29:31,764 --> 00:29:33,833
What do you think?

00:29:33,833 --> 00:29:36,636
"Athos, Porthos, Aramis."

00:29:36,636 --> 00:29:39,038
The Three Musketeers.

00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:41,040
Yeah, see, I don't think we're
looking at a sleeper cell.

00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,576
I think we're looking
at-at dreamers, you know?

00:29:43,576 --> 00:29:44,744
Misfits.

00:29:44,744 --> 00:29:47,513
Guys who were
obsessed with racing

00:29:47,513 --> 00:29:48,981
wanted to win the big one.

00:29:48,981 --> 00:29:51,450
And how do you explain the bomb?

00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:52,985
I can't right now,

00:29:52,985 --> 00:29:55,421
but I-I just know
when I'm looking at Clive Morris

00:29:55,421 --> 00:29:57,657
that I'm not
looking at a killer.

00:29:59,392 --> 00:30:01,894
The glasses, right?

00:30:01,894 --> 00:30:04,463
Paranoid personality disorder.

00:30:04,463 --> 00:30:06,766
Yeah.

00:30:06,766 --> 00:30:08,868
I've seen it before, and um...

00:30:08,868 --> 00:30:10,603
growing up
the way I did

00:30:10,603 --> 00:30:13,105
with my crazy, wandering family,

00:30:13,105 --> 00:30:15,441
I was always the weird one.

00:30:15,441 --> 00:30:17,610
Couldn't have been easy
living in a van.

00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:21,480
No, but every summer, I got
this little taste of normal.

00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,482
You know, we'd always land
at my cousin's house

00:30:23,482 --> 00:30:25,751
for a-a whole month.

00:30:25,751 --> 00:30:26,952
He was a really good kid.

00:30:26,952 --> 00:30:28,387
Great at basketball.

00:30:28,387 --> 00:30:29,755
But one summer,

00:30:29,755 --> 00:30:31,557
he started telling me
about this birdhouse

00:30:31,557 --> 00:30:33,492
that a neighbor had built
across the street.

00:30:33,492 --> 00:30:34,827
He was convinced

00:30:34,827 --> 00:30:38,597
that there was
a camera inside it, right?

00:30:38,597 --> 00:30:40,032
Every time we walked by it,

00:30:40,032 --> 00:30:41,967
he'd look up and smile

00:30:41,967 --> 00:30:44,103
and then, pfft, flip it off.

00:30:44,103 --> 00:30:46,105
Yeah. "They're watching."

00:30:46,105 --> 00:30:47,907
Yeah.

00:30:47,907 --> 00:30:50,910
The way Clive Morris was looking
around the room for the cameras,

00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:52,478
reminded me of my cousin.

00:30:52,478 --> 00:30:54,447
It got worse, too.

00:30:54,447 --> 00:30:55,948
Towards the end, he, uh,

00:30:55,948 --> 00:30:58,651
even thought that
my glasses were cameras,

00:30:58,651 --> 00:31:00,853
and that I was recording
his every move.

00:31:00,853 --> 00:31:02,722
What happened to him?

00:31:02,722 --> 00:31:05,458
Not a happy ending.

00:31:11,464 --> 00:31:13,666
Yeah, I know
a little bit about, uh...

00:31:13,666 --> 00:31:15,501
that kind of sad ending myself.

00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:18,838
My mom.

00:31:18,838 --> 00:31:21,574
I didn't know that. I'm sorry.

00:31:21,574 --> 00:31:23,509
Me, too.

00:31:23,509 --> 00:31:24,677
(phone chimes)

00:31:24,677 --> 00:31:26,011
Oh, Henry.

00:31:26,011 --> 00:31:27,847
Huh.

00:31:27,847 --> 00:31:29,448
Excuse me.

00:31:32,651 --> 00:31:33,986
What do you got?

00:31:33,986 --> 00:31:35,621
I've been tracking

00:31:35,621 --> 00:31:38,524
how Kathy Veck received
her digital death threats.

00:31:38,524 --> 00:31:41,460
Now, the majority of recent ones
came from an e-mail account

00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:44,363
belonging to Malcolm Platt.

00:31:44,363 --> 00:31:45,865
I had a feeling about this guy.

00:31:45,865 --> 00:31:47,099
The last one was sent
an hour ago.

00:31:47,099 --> 00:31:50,636
Now, I traced it
to his active IP.

00:31:50,636 --> 00:31:52,538
It was routed though a hotspot
in the middle of the desert,

00:31:52,538 --> 00:31:53,973
the middle of nowhere.

00:31:53,973 --> 00:31:56,008
More like a middle
of The Desert Blast 200 course.

00:31:56,008 --> 00:31:57,610
I heard the race was back on,

00:31:57,610 --> 00:31:59,645
so Kathy Veck's
probably there, right?

00:32:04,617 --> 00:32:06,419
Veck never showed
at the starting line.

00:32:06,419 --> 00:32:07,853
Nobody's seen her
all morning.

00:32:07,853 --> 00:32:09,688
They figured she probably
dropped out of the race.

00:32:09,688 --> 00:32:11,157
Yeah, then what's her camp
still doing here?

00:32:11,157 --> 00:32:12,892
Good question.

00:32:12,892 --> 00:32:14,560
Wait, hold up.

00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,962
That looks like blood
right there, boys.

00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:21,634
LVPD!

00:32:24,737 --> 00:32:25,671
(door thuds)

00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:39,018
(man grunting in pain)

00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,788
(grunting in pain)

00:32:42,788 --> 00:32:43,923
It's Malcolm Platt.

00:32:43,923 --> 00:32:46,425
Malcolm, what happened?

00:32:46,425 --> 00:32:47,660
It's Vartann.
I need a paramedic ASAP.

00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,462
He took her.

00:32:49,462 --> 00:32:51,096
Took who?

00:32:51,096 --> 00:32:53,666
Kathy. Veck.

00:32:53,666 --> 00:32:55,835
He's gonna kill her.

00:32:55,835 --> 00:32:57,503
Who's gonna kill her, Malcolm?

00:32:57,503 --> 00:32:58,671
Paramedics are en route.

00:32:58,671 --> 00:33:01,540
Malcolm.

00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:02,641
Malcolm?

00:33:02,641 --> 00:33:03,976
It's too late
for that now.

00:33:03,976 --> 00:33:06,045
Where's Kathy Veck?
He didn't say.

00:33:06,045 --> 00:33:07,980
But with all this carnage
left behind her,

00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,915
she can't be headed
anywhere good.

00:33:19,058 --> 00:33:20,826
Vartann put a BOLO out
on Kathy Veck's racing truck.

00:33:20,826 --> 00:33:22,828
You got to figure whoever
took her, took her in it.

00:33:22,828 --> 00:33:24,630
And look what Nick found
next to Veck's pit.

00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:25,764
Empty box of dynamite.

00:33:25,764 --> 00:33:28,367
That used to have
20 pieces.

00:33:28,367 --> 00:33:29,635
Maybe our guy
with the gun

00:33:29,635 --> 00:33:31,737
took them along
on his ride with Kathy.

00:33:31,737 --> 00:33:33,439
That is a lot of firepower.

00:33:33,439 --> 00:33:35,441
Who would Malcolm
trust this much

00:33:35,441 --> 00:33:36,642
that he went
along with him?

00:33:36,642 --> 00:33:38,544
I mean,
with Jack dead

00:33:38,544 --> 00:33:41,380
and Clive in custody, there
aren't any other Musketeers.

00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:43,649
You know, I don't want
to sound like Russell,

00:33:43,649 --> 00:33:45,384
but wasn't there
a fourth Musketeer

00:33:45,384 --> 00:33:47,720
in the original story?
Yes.

00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,988
And...

00:33:48,988 --> 00:33:50,856
we still have a Musketeer
in lockup

00:33:50,856 --> 00:33:52,791
who may be able
to tell us who that is.

00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,595
I've never raced a car before.

00:33:56,595 --> 00:33:59,398
I guess I don't like
to go fast.

00:33:59,398 --> 00:34:00,499
What about you, Clive?

00:34:00,499 --> 00:34:02,568
Why do you race?

00:34:03,903 --> 00:34:05,437
Oh, no,

00:34:05,437 --> 00:34:06,906
it's not a camera.

00:34:06,906 --> 00:34:08,707
And these...
these aren't, either.

00:34:08,707 --> 00:34:11,577
Here. I'm sorry, I'll...
put 'em away.

00:34:11,577 --> 00:34:13,145
Why do you care?

00:34:13,145 --> 00:34:16,448
We're profiling you;
it's what we do, Clive.

00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:19,418
My guess is that you
love the danger of racing.

00:34:19,418 --> 00:34:21,020
It's a way for you

00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:24,023
to embrace all of your fear
and channel it into adrenaline.

00:34:24,023 --> 00:34:26,492
You don't know what
you're talking about.
RUSSELL: I think we do.

00:34:26,492 --> 00:34:29,495
I don't even think that you knew
there was a bomb in that truck.

00:34:29,495 --> 00:34:32,131
Neither did Jack.
Malcolm, though,
I'm not so sure about.

00:34:32,131 --> 00:34:33,599
No.

00:34:35,768 --> 00:34:38,137
Malcolm was committed
to winning the race, too.

00:34:38,137 --> 00:34:41,607
Winning the race--
that's all you guys wanted,

00:34:41,607 --> 00:34:43,142
isn't it?

00:34:43,142 --> 00:34:45,477
The message you
left for Jack

00:34:45,477 --> 00:34:48,013
about not getting
in the truck...

00:34:48,013 --> 00:34:50,950
it wasn't about the bomb-- you
didn't even know it was a bomb.

00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:53,385
So what were you afraid of?

00:34:53,385 --> 00:34:55,487
(sighs)

00:34:55,487 --> 00:34:58,090
I saw the way
she was looking at us.

00:34:58,090 --> 00:35:00,459
The night before the race.

00:35:00,459 --> 00:35:01,927
Her and her goons.

00:35:01,927 --> 00:35:03,896
Kathy Veck?

00:35:03,896 --> 00:35:06,765
I knew she wasn't
gonna let us win.

00:35:06,765 --> 00:35:09,902
I knew she was gonna ruin
our one chance.

00:35:09,902 --> 00:35:11,136
What do you mean, your...

00:35:11,136 --> 00:35:13,005
Our chance to show Kathy Veck

00:35:13,005 --> 00:35:15,507
that money doesn't always rule.

00:35:15,507 --> 00:35:17,576
What does rule, Clive?

00:35:17,576 --> 00:35:20,079
Heart.

00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:22,014
Truth.

00:35:23,916 --> 00:35:26,051
Loyalty.

00:35:26,051 --> 00:35:30,089
You know, I know I'm not gonna
ever convince you to trust me,

00:35:30,089 --> 00:35:33,792
so I'm just gonna tell you
what I believe.

00:35:33,792 --> 00:35:35,761
I don't think
you're a stupid man.

00:35:35,761 --> 00:35:37,730
I think you're very bright.

00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:39,031
People like Kathy Veck
don't have

00:35:39,031 --> 00:35:40,666
to get their hands dirty to win.

00:35:40,666 --> 00:35:42,434
She didn't put that
bomb on your truck,

00:35:42,434 --> 00:35:43,669
but somebody did,
and that someone

00:35:43,669 --> 00:35:46,105
had access to your truck.

00:35:48,674 --> 00:35:51,510
There's a fourth Musketeer,
isn't there?

00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:53,545
Oh, come on, Clive,

00:35:53,545 --> 00:35:56,015
what just happened to...
to heart,

00:35:56,015 --> 00:35:57,149
truth, loyalty?

00:35:57,149 --> 00:35:58,550
I mean, whoever did it

00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:00,386
killed your friends.

00:36:00,386 --> 00:36:03,422
Don't you think you
owe them a little justice?

00:36:03,422 --> 00:36:04,423
Clive...

00:36:06,558 --> 00:36:08,160
...you've got to help us.

00:36:19,605 --> 00:36:22,007
Entering the truck
was his idea.

00:36:22,007 --> 00:36:24,476
He helped us
build it.

00:36:24,476 --> 00:36:27,079
He said he was gonna
make us part of something
really special.

00:36:27,079 --> 00:36:29,948
There was a lot
of bad in the world.

00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:34,420
He was trying
to make something good.

00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:36,422
I've heard those words before.

00:36:37,956 --> 00:36:40,993
Your fourth Musketeer
told me the same thing.

00:36:43,862 --> 00:36:46,598
Art Weber is
the fourth Musketeer.

00:36:46,598 --> 00:36:48,867
He didn't expect us to follow
that oil pan back to them.

00:36:48,867 --> 00:36:50,602
He even said
himself that he was

00:36:50,602 --> 00:36:51,937
gonna tell me
a crazy story,

00:36:51,937 --> 00:36:53,472
which I fell for.

00:36:53,472 --> 00:36:54,940
SANDERS
He's a retired engineer.

00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:57,443
Worked at Ferndale
Mining Company.
Wait a minute.

00:36:57,443 --> 00:37:00,713
Serial number on the
empty box of dynamite
we found at the scene

00:37:00,713 --> 00:37:02,715
traces back
to Ferndale Mining Company.

00:37:02,715 --> 00:37:04,750
Guess we know
who the bomb maker is.

00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:06,585
And according to my math,

00:37:06,585 --> 00:37:09,822
Art used only two sticks of
dynamite on that racing truck.

00:37:09,822 --> 00:37:10,989
Dynamite crate held 20.

00:37:10,989 --> 00:37:12,725
I mean, he's got
enough to...

00:37:12,725 --> 00:37:14,059
take down a building.

00:37:14,059 --> 00:37:15,728
(sighs)

00:37:15,728 --> 00:37:17,563
Okay, Web search

00:37:17,563 --> 00:37:20,799
brought up some posts
made to an Internet forum:

00:37:20,799 --> 00:37:22,835
SickWithRage.com.

00:37:22,835 --> 00:37:24,436
And this one is

00:37:24,436 --> 00:37:25,904
from about a month ago.

00:37:25,904 --> 00:37:28,107
Used to be you work
your ass off for a company,

00:37:28,107 --> 00:37:31,577
they'd take care of you and
your loved ones, but no more.

00:37:31,577 --> 00:37:33,846
Corporate scum come in,
pillage our pensions,

00:37:33,846 --> 00:37:37,049
strip our health care,
leave my wife to die,

00:37:37,049 --> 00:37:39,451
leave me bankrupt...
(scoffs)

00:37:39,451 --> 00:37:42,621
"Hey, just following
orders." Bull.

00:37:42,621 --> 00:37:44,757
I will not go gently!

00:37:44,757 --> 00:37:47,760
They started this war;
I'll finish it!

00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,629
What put Kathy Veck
in his crosshairs?

00:37:52,965 --> 00:37:57,436
Ferndale Mining Company,
a subsidiary of Veck

00:37:57,436 --> 00:37:58,437
Oil International.

00:37:58,437 --> 00:37:59,805
He blames Kathy Veck

00:37:59,805 --> 00:38:01,006
for his wife's death,

00:38:01,006 --> 00:38:02,875
for leaving him penniless...
So Weber

00:38:02,875 --> 00:38:07,079
learns that Veck's gonna be
out in the desert racing, alone,

00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:08,380
vulnerable.

00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,848
He sees a rare
opportunity

00:38:09,848 --> 00:38:11,483
to get at her.

00:38:11,483 --> 00:38:14,486
Then he meets the Musketeers,
also vulnerable

00:38:14,486 --> 00:38:16,121
in their own way...
He used them.

00:38:16,121 --> 00:38:18,557
He secretly turned their
truck into a bomb on wheels.

00:38:18,557 --> 00:38:20,392
Weber knew from
driver radio

00:38:20,392 --> 00:38:23,695
when that truck was
gonna be near Veck's.

00:38:23,695 --> 00:38:25,764
He detonates the bomb
and he misses his target.

00:38:25,764 --> 00:38:27,399
All right,
so Weber switches gears.

00:38:27,399 --> 00:38:29,434
He kidnaps Veck instead.

00:38:29,434 --> 00:38:31,904
But why not kill her?
Why take her for a ride?

00:38:31,904 --> 00:38:33,572
The dynamite.

00:38:33,572 --> 00:38:35,707
He wanted to blow her up
at the race, right?

00:38:35,707 --> 00:38:37,442
Maybe now

00:38:37,442 --> 00:38:39,378
he's planning to make
an even bigger statement.

00:38:39,378 --> 00:38:41,547
(engine roaring)

00:38:49,588 --> 00:38:50,689
(tires squeal)

00:38:58,697 --> 00:39:02,935
(sirens approaching)

00:39:02,935 --> 00:39:04,636
Get out of my way
if you want to live!

00:39:04,636 --> 00:39:07,105
RUSSELL:
Mr. Weber?
I'm not talking to the cops!

00:39:07,105 --> 00:39:08,574
You people protect
scum like her

00:39:08,574 --> 00:39:10,576
and make guys like me
the criminals!

00:39:10,576 --> 00:39:13,679
Get me out of here!
This guy is crazy!
Keep your mouth shut!

00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:16,415
Sir, sir, I'm not
even gonna try to talk
to you, I promise.

00:39:16,415 --> 00:39:18,550
But there's someone here
who wants to.

00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:19,918
Please.

00:39:19,918 --> 00:39:21,854
Clive, come here.

00:39:23,155 --> 00:39:24,723
Look at me.
Look at me.

00:39:24,723 --> 00:39:26,792
Settle down. Look at me.
Look me in the eyes.

00:39:26,792 --> 00:39:28,160
You can do this.

00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,128
All right?
Just talk to him,
just talk to him.

00:39:35,734 --> 00:39:37,636
We were supposed to win, Art.

00:39:39,705 --> 00:39:41,807
You're not gonna win like this.

00:39:41,807 --> 00:39:44,376
Get out of here, Clive.

00:39:44,376 --> 00:39:45,944
No!

00:39:47,579 --> 00:39:50,415
You said you wanted
to make something good.

This isn't what your wife
would have wanted...

00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:55,454
I don't want

00:39:55,454 --> 00:39:56,922
to talk about my wife!

00:39:56,922 --> 00:39:58,423
I know.

00:39:58,423 --> 00:40:00,659
I-I know you loved her.

00:40:00,659 --> 00:40:02,961
Like I loved Jack and Malcolm.

00:40:02,961 --> 00:40:05,097
Please...

00:40:05,097 --> 00:40:07,566
don't-don't hurt anyone else.

RUSSELL:
Look, i-if you do this,
people like her,

00:40:10,836 --> 00:40:12,671
they win--
you don't want that.

00:40:14,439 --> 00:40:16,041
You don't know
what you're talking about.

00:40:16,041 --> 00:40:18,377
But I do.

00:40:18,377 --> 00:40:20,012

Just do the right thing, Art.

Come on, you don't
want to do this.

00:40:42,434 --> 00:40:44,369
You're not like her.

00:40:52,444 --> 00:40:54,646
You're right.

00:40:55,981 --> 00:40:57,616
