00:00:36,037 --> 00:00:38,773
Hey. What are
you doing here?

00:00:38,773 --> 00:00:41,476
I work here...
close to 20 years now.

00:00:41,476 --> 00:00:43,878
You're two and a
half hours early.

00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:46,915
My house is too quiet,
if that makes any sense.

00:00:46,915 --> 00:00:48,983
Oh, no, it makes complete sense.

00:00:48,983 --> 00:00:50,885
Yeah, our youngest has been

00:00:50,885 --> 00:00:52,921
out of the house now
for three months,

00:00:52,921 --> 00:00:54,789

with empty nest.

00:00:54,789 --> 00:00:55,924
Yeah.

00:00:55,924 --> 00:00:57,392

00:00:57,392 --> 00:00:58,526
Lindsey.

Lindsey, yeah.
Yeah.

00:00:59,961 --> 00:01:01,663
Uh, she's doing...
she's doing really good.

00:01:01,663 --> 00:01:02,931
She's doing great, in fact.

00:01:02,931 --> 00:01:04,566
She's... well, according
to her e-mails.

Hey, do you do that thing
where you call them,

00:01:06,668 --> 00:01:08,903
and then you get
this three-word text back?

00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:11,406
Doesn't it make
you crazy?

00:01:11,406 --> 00:01:12,140
Yes, but, um...

00:01:13,841 --> 00:01:16,377

Police officers found
the door ajar.

00:01:33,528 --> 00:01:34,996
No sign of forced entry.

00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,569
Place belongs
to Michael Newbury.

00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:43,471
Army Ranger,
military lifer.

00:01:43,471 --> 00:01:45,406
Retired out here
15 years ago.

00:01:45,406 --> 00:01:47,675
Hmm.
Married to the mission.

00:01:47,675 --> 00:01:51,012
Not a woman's touch.

00:01:51,012 --> 00:01:53,514
No photos, no family.

00:01:54,682 --> 00:01:57,852

Well, there's
none to speak of.

00:02:06,761 --> 00:02:08,029
We found blood

00:02:08,029 --> 00:02:11,466
and evidence of
those shots fired.

00:02:11,466 --> 00:02:12,867
Lots of evidence.

00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:16,904
Do you recognize
this caliber?

00:02:16,904 --> 00:02:19,641
Five-point-seven by 28?

00:02:19,641 --> 00:02:21,376
Never seen it before.
Yeah.

00:02:21,376 --> 00:02:23,044
Neither have I.

00:02:26,848 --> 00:02:28,850
Casings have rolled
all over the floor.

00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:33,121
Kind of hard to tell
where the shooter was.

00:02:33,121 --> 00:02:36,090
Easy to place the shots, though.

00:02:37,525 --> 00:02:40,828
Okay, so, our guy was

00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:43,865
probably standing here,
got shot, right?

Kept to himself?

00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,635
By all accounts, a hermit.

00:04:27,635 --> 00:04:28,936
Anybody float
any theories

00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:30,671
on why someone would
want to hurt him?

00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:34,609
No, and apparently, he had
no friends and no enemies.

00:04:34,609 --> 00:04:38,780
But one of the neighbors called
him a, quote, "a peaceful soul."

00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,882
Yeah, I'm betting they
hadn't seen that gun room.

00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:43,084
Greg.

00:04:43,084 --> 00:04:44,485
Let me show
you something.

00:04:47,488 --> 00:04:49,390
When the sun came
up-- thank you--

00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:52,026
the unis found a
secondary scene.

00:04:52,026 --> 00:04:54,862
Take a look at it, will you,
and tell me what you see?

00:04:54,862 --> 00:04:58,533
Well, I see lots
of cartridge casings.

00:04:58,533 --> 00:04:59,967
Where are the bullet holes?

00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:04,038
In the ground, by way of
a body, I'm thinking.

00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:05,373
Take a look at that jelly

00:05:05,373 --> 00:05:07,809
that's kind of
jammed in there.

00:05:07,809 --> 00:05:09,744
Looks like human flesh, right?

00:05:09,744 --> 00:05:11,646
Looks like it.

00:05:11,646 --> 00:05:13,614
Bone fragments,
intestinal tissue.

00:05:13,614 --> 00:05:14,782
Take a look

00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:16,984
at the tissue a little closer.

00:05:18,452 --> 00:05:20,555
Margins aren't inflamed.

00:05:20,555 --> 00:05:22,423
Capillaries are withdrawn.

00:05:22,423 --> 00:05:24,091
Tells me that this victim's
heart stopped beating

00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:25,560
before all this
damage was done.

00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,428
But why would you shoot
a dead man

00:05:27,428 --> 00:05:29,163
a hundred times?

00:05:30,765 --> 00:05:32,967
I don't know...

00:05:32,967 --> 00:05:35,870
but maybe this has something
to do with it.

00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,639
Looks like a grommet
or something, right?

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:39,874
Shower curtain?

00:06:10,104 --> 00:06:12,506
Which one of these is for OCD?

00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:16,911
Hey, check this out.

00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:21,682
Oh. Looks Arabic.

00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:23,417
That's all I got.

00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:24,752
Took Spanish in high school.

00:06:24,752 --> 00:06:26,587
<i>Moi, Francais.</i>

00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:30,424
But fortunately...
there's an app for that.

00:06:30,424 --> 00:06:31,859
Of course there is.

00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:33,494
(beeping)

00:06:33,494 --> 00:06:34,862
(blipping)

00:06:34,862 --> 00:06:36,597
"Farsi."

00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:40,701
Ex-military, a loner,
a room full of guns.

00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:43,638
And medication from
the Middle East.

00:06:43,638 --> 00:06:44,939
Who the hell was this guy?

00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:52,546
Whew.

00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:53,848
Well, leave it up to you

00:06:53,848 --> 00:06:55,917
to find the books
in a room full of guns.

00:06:55,917 --> 00:06:57,418
Let me ask you
something.

00:06:57,418 --> 00:06:59,453
What do you have on your
bookshelves at home?

00:06:59,453 --> 00:07:02,556
Uh, <i>Sports Illustrated,</i>
<i>MoneyBall,</i>

00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:04,125
bunch of forensics books--

00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:07,561
But all in all, like,
a good representation

00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:08,596
of who you are, right?

00:07:08,596 --> 00:07:11,499
Man, fan, CSI.

00:07:11,499 --> 00:07:13,701
So, what's on this guy's
reading list?

00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:15,002
<i>Great American Manifestoes?</i>

00:07:15,002 --> 00:07:16,637
No, that's
the interesting thing.

00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:19,507
I mean, he's got
<i>Journal of Ballistics,</i>

00:07:19,507 --> 00:07:21,609
<i>Hatcher's Notebook,</i>
<i>Firearms Assembly, Part Three.</i>

00:07:21,609 --> 00:07:23,611
He's even got a classical

00:07:23,611 --> 00:07:25,446
mechanics text.

00:07:25,446 --> 00:07:27,748
So, he's a <i>nerdy</i> gun nut.

00:07:27,748 --> 00:07:30,651
Yeah, I think he's more
like a scientist, like us.

00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:32,053
I mean, look at this workspace.

00:07:32,053 --> 00:07:33,521
You could eat off this sucker.

00:07:33,521 --> 00:07:35,790
Everything in its place.

00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,658
Oh, come here.
This is so cool.

00:07:37,658 --> 00:07:41,762
All his guns are organized by
theater of conflict, you know?

00:07:41,762 --> 00:07:45,166
World War II Europe all the way
to the surge in Afghanistan.

00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:46,934
Cool, huh?

00:07:46,934 --> 00:07:48,936
Yeah, the coolest, but we need
info on a more current conflict.

00:07:48,936 --> 00:07:51,038
The shooting up
in the kitchen.
Which is why

00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:53,641
I called in the big gun. Hey,

00:07:53,641 --> 00:07:56,544
Xiomara, welcome to Xanadu.

00:07:56,544 --> 00:07:58,079
Wow.

00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:01,582
This is so much like my dreams,
it's scary.

00:08:01,582 --> 00:08:02,817
Yeah, let me ask
you something

00:08:02,817 --> 00:08:04,618
before I completely
lose you here.

00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:06,921
You recognize
that caliber?

00:08:06,921 --> 00:08:10,524
Five-point-seven
by 28 mil. Rare.

00:08:10,524 --> 00:08:12,460
Can't even buy these rounds
in the States.

00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,928
STOKES:
Oh, you can fire plenty.

00:08:13,928 --> 00:08:16,030
Someone put seven in our victim.

00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:20,668
So, you think any of these
could be the culprit?

00:08:20,668 --> 00:08:22,403
Hmm... Well, as
much as I'd love

00:08:22,403 --> 00:08:26,507
to fire that Italian 38
Troopen Special,

00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:29,043
or even just touch that
million dollar Luger...

00:08:29,043 --> 00:08:30,511
STOKES:
Geez.

00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:32,446
Get a room.
Oh, I got one.

00:08:32,446 --> 00:08:34,148
And it's perfect.

00:08:34,148 --> 00:08:35,750
The only problem is,

00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,952
none of these guns in
here use that caliber.

00:08:37,952 --> 00:08:39,620
Oh, it's crazy.

00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,956
All this firepower,
and still no murder weapon.

00:08:44,058 --> 00:08:46,527
Catherine,
who do you want to be?

00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:47,795
Victim or killer?

00:08:47,795 --> 00:08:49,597
I'll be the killer.

00:08:49,597 --> 00:08:52,133
I'll be the victim.
I've got a beer in my hand,

00:08:52,133 --> 00:08:54,969
I'm standing
in my own kitchen, I've got

00:08:54,969 --> 00:08:57,571
every kind of gun
six meters that way.

00:08:57,571 --> 00:09:00,674
I'm heading that way
when I'm shot.

00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:04,412
These laser trajectories
are too low.

00:09:11,452 --> 00:09:13,854
Thought the killer
surprised him.

00:09:13,854 --> 00:09:15,489
The lasers tell us that

00:09:15,489 --> 00:09:18,459
he was well inside
before he fired.

00:09:21,996 --> 00:09:24,098
Killer was sitting
at the counter.

00:09:24,098 --> 00:09:26,133
Newbury welcomed him
into his home.

00:09:28,169 --> 00:09:30,571
Maybe they both
had a beer together.

00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,051
So, he was killed

00:09:44,051 --> 00:09:44,985
by somebody he knew.

00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:50,424
Well, our victim's paper trail
is pretty straightforward.

00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:51,792
Ex-Army.

00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:54,061
Bought his little piece
of heaven in 1997.

00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:56,097
Lived there
peacefully ever since.

00:09:56,097 --> 00:09:58,132
Never married, never arrested,

00:09:58,132 --> 00:10:01,602
and never out of the country
except for Gulf War I.

00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:02,703
I think you're wrong on that.

00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:04,105
I'm sorry?

00:10:04,105 --> 00:10:05,906
Oh, don't be sorry.
Just be wrong.

00:10:05,906 --> 00:10:08,409
I ran your Farsi label.
It's, uh,

00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:11,812
Hexadecylphosphocholine,
which is the drug of choice

00:10:11,812 --> 00:10:13,914
for the Kala Azar parasite.

00:10:13,914 --> 00:10:16,750
This particular little
bugger resides exclusively

00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,586
in the Middle East.
How do you get

00:10:18,586 --> 00:10:20,588
a Middle Eastern parasite
in Mountain Springs?

00:10:20,588 --> 00:10:22,456
You don't.

00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:24,658
It seems our evidence
trails contradict each other.

00:10:24,658 --> 00:10:26,760
Which brings us back
to you being wrong.

00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,796
Hey, why am I the one
who's wrong?

00:10:28,796 --> 00:10:30,531
Because the other person is me.

00:10:30,531 --> 00:10:33,100
Okay, well, tell you what.

00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,904
Hair never lies, so,
let's let it decide.

00:11:04,064 --> 00:11:05,966
So the bullets in the kitchen
and the bullets

00:11:05,966 --> 00:11:07,568
in the ground out by the barn...

00:11:07,568 --> 00:11:09,436
Match each other.
Same weapon.

00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:11,772
Great. Did you
get a hit on IBIS?
No.

00:11:11,772 --> 00:11:13,941
Caliber's never been used
in a crime in the U.S.

00:11:13,941 --> 00:11:16,810
But given the nature
of the ammo,

00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:18,712
I called in a
favor to a buddy,

00:11:18,712 --> 00:11:21,415
who ran it through the
military ballistics database.

00:11:21,415 --> 00:11:23,918
Nice to have friends
with friends in high places.

00:11:23,918 --> 00:11:25,486
The same weapon

00:11:25,486 --> 00:11:27,922
was used in a crime scene
in Pakistan a month ago.

00:11:27,922 --> 00:11:30,824
This gun gets around.
What happened in Pakistan?

00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:33,661
Military supplies were stolen;
a warehouse guard was shot.

00:11:33,661 --> 00:11:35,162
Wow, the plot thickens.

00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:38,532
Yeah, and then it thins
once you get to page two.

00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:40,100
The report's been
heavily redacted.
(chuckles)

00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,702
Yeah, I'll say.

00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:42,836
The whole thing's blacked out.

00:11:42,836 --> 00:11:43,938
Oh, I found a word:

00:11:43,938 --> 00:11:45,439
"The."

00:11:45,439 --> 00:11:47,841
Hey, can I keep one of these?
Sure.

00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:49,944
We're looking
for D.B. Russell.

00:11:49,944 --> 00:11:51,145
That's me.

00:11:51,145 --> 00:11:52,846
Who are you guys?

00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:54,848
We ran a test
on the victim's hair.

00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:56,617
The oxygen isotopes
that are found

00:11:56,617 --> 00:11:58,986
in the local water supplies
leave markers in the hair,

00:11:58,986 --> 00:12:00,788
which indicate where
Mr. Newbury has been

00:12:00,788 --> 00:12:02,122
in the last
three months.

00:12:02,122 --> 00:12:03,557
BRODY:
Each .44

00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:05,793
millimeters of hair
is a day in the life.

00:12:05,793 --> 00:12:07,027
And, oh, the places

00:12:07,027 --> 00:12:09,797
he's been in those
five centimeters.

00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:13,434
Iraq, DC,

00:12:13,434 --> 00:12:15,102
Israel, Belgium,

00:12:15,102 --> 00:12:17,605
DC again, Pakistan.

00:12:17,605 --> 00:12:20,007
Have guns, did travel.
But there are
no official records

00:12:20,007 --> 00:12:21,508
of him going to
any of these places.

00:12:21,508 --> 00:12:24,044
No airline tickets,
immunization,

00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:26,614
State Department records--
nothing.

00:12:26,614 --> 00:12:28,048
So his passport's
never been stamped,

00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:29,750
but his body's been
around the world?

00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,886
Extended family meeting--
now, please.

00:12:32,886 --> 00:12:34,755
What... did he mean
by "extended"?

00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:35,990
RUSSELL:
Hey, come on in, everybody.

00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:37,558
I want to...

00:12:37,558 --> 00:12:40,394
I want to introduce a
couple of people to you.

00:12:40,394 --> 00:12:42,596
This is Agent McQuaid,
Special-Agent-in-Charge Pratt.

00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:43,964
They're with
the Las Vegas

00:12:43,964 --> 00:12:46,767
field office
of the FBI.

00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:48,969
We're here to help you with
the Michael Newbury homicide.

00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:51,138
You mean you're here
to take over the case from us.

00:12:51,138 --> 00:12:52,773
Not at all.

00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:54,908
No, this case is still under
Las Vegas PD jurisdiction.

00:12:54,908 --> 00:12:57,411
We're just here to offer
our assistance.

00:12:57,411 --> 00:12:59,546
Assistance with what, exactly?

00:12:59,546 --> 00:13:01,682
That, I'm afraid,
is on a need-to-know basis.

00:13:01,682 --> 00:13:03,450
And who decides
who needs to know?

00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,952
Anyway, we're really

00:13:04,952 --> 00:13:07,021
excited to be working with you.
WILLOWS:
Oh, yeah,

00:13:07,021 --> 00:13:08,155
ditto.

00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:09,556
Hey, hey.
Come on.

00:13:09,556 --> 00:13:10,791
Let's play nice.

00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:21,669
Oh, boy, that's good.

00:13:21,669 --> 00:13:24,738
Sure I can't get you any,
uh, soy milk for that?

00:13:24,738 --> 00:13:26,740
A little agave?

00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,809
No. No, thank you.
Black's great.

00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:30,678
All right.

00:13:30,678 --> 00:13:32,479
So, here we are.
We said we'd
brief you.

00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:33,514
Who's she?

00:13:33,514 --> 00:13:34,581
I'm sorry.

00:13:34,581 --> 00:13:35,816
This is Catherine.

00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:37,951
And Catherine was me
before I was.

00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:39,653
And I have assigned
Catherine

00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:41,855
to be the lead
on this case.

00:13:41,855 --> 00:13:44,058
Okay? So...

00:13:44,058 --> 00:13:45,492
what is going on here?

00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:47,094
I mean, we got
a room full of guns,

00:13:47,094 --> 00:13:49,630
we got missing bodies,
and now the FBI?

00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:50,964
Is this domestic
terrorism?

00:13:50,964 --> 00:13:52,599
We have no
reason to believe

00:13:52,599 --> 00:13:55,035
that Mr. Newbury
was... a threat.

00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:56,904
No, he was a ballistics
consultant, right?

00:13:56,904 --> 00:13:59,106
Yours or the military's?

00:13:59,106 --> 00:14:00,607
What makes you say that?

00:14:00,607 --> 00:14:02,009
Oh, I didn't say it.

00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:03,711
A strand of his hair did.

00:14:03,711 --> 00:14:05,045
For three months,

00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:06,613
he's been
jumping from DC

00:14:06,613 --> 00:14:10,517
to every artillery hot spot
on the globe.

00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,653
We can't really
speak to that.

00:14:12,653 --> 00:14:16,156
Can you speak to why
you fellas are so
interested in his death?

00:14:16,156 --> 00:14:19,626
We're more interested
in the weapon that we
believe killed him.

00:14:19,626 --> 00:14:21,562
This is
the FN-P90,

00:14:21,562 --> 00:14:24,531
manufactured in Belgium,
currently used by U.S. troops

00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:25,766
in urban sweeps
of Afghanistan.

00:14:25,766 --> 00:14:27,134
It's an entry weapon.

00:14:27,134 --> 00:14:29,103
It's got a lot of power,
a compact frame that

00:14:29,103 --> 00:14:30,771
allows you to go
around corners

00:14:30,771 --> 00:14:32,773
and sweep stairwells--
it's a bit of a beast.

00:14:32,773 --> 00:14:35,109
And how the hell did that thing
get into Clark County?

00:14:35,109 --> 00:14:36,977
I'm afraid
that's classified.

00:14:36,977 --> 00:14:38,645
Yes, of course
it is.

00:14:38,645 --> 00:14:40,781
Hey, out of curiosity,

00:14:40,781 --> 00:14:43,417
what year did you graduate
from Brigham Young?

00:14:43,417 --> 00:14:46,620
'03. How'd you know?
FBI recruiters

00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,790
are all over that place
like chickens on a June bug.

00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,091
Am I right?
If you're...

00:14:51,091 --> 00:14:53,160
concerned with my age,

00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,896
I promise you,
I've earned my stripes.

00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:57,398
So have I.

00:14:57,398 --> 00:14:59,900
Every suspicious
cargo container in Seattle

00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:00,934
came with a pair of you guys.

00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:02,403
Eight out of ten times,

00:15:02,403 --> 00:15:04,004
it was great.

00:15:04,004 --> 00:15:07,708
Resources, manpower-- made
my job a hell of a lot easier.

00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:09,743
And... the other two?

00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:11,445
Well, you guys
would lose interest

00:15:11,445 --> 00:15:13,947
and chase off after
the next shiny object,

00:15:13,947 --> 00:15:17,684
leaving us with a pretty shoddy
chain of custody.

00:15:17,684 --> 00:15:19,486
We have no intention

00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:21,121
of compromising
your investigation.
I have no intention

00:15:21,121 --> 00:15:22,489
of letting you. So,

00:15:22,489 --> 00:15:23,757
here's what we're gonna do.

00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:25,559
We are going to pair up.

00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:26,894
Mixed doubles, all right?

00:15:26,894 --> 00:15:29,463
All right? Every
CSI gets an FBI.

00:15:29,463 --> 00:15:31,665
Catherine, why don't
you take Agent McQuaid,

00:15:31,665 --> 00:15:33,700
go back out to the farm,
re-scour the place.

00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,002
Let's get a bead on that body.

00:15:35,002 --> 00:15:36,904
Okay?
I'll drive?

00:15:36,904 --> 00:15:39,072
Hey, I got my own driver.

00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:40,407
Score.

00:15:41,508 --> 00:15:43,677
And what about me?
You...

00:15:43,677 --> 00:15:45,446
are my new best friend.

00:15:45,446 --> 00:15:49,416
Somebody spilled ink
all over my Pakistani

00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:51,518
crime report,
and I'm just betting...

00:15:51,518 --> 00:15:53,454
I mean, look at that.

00:15:53,454 --> 00:15:55,889
I'm just betting that your
copy's a little more legible

00:15:55,889 --> 00:15:57,658
than this one.

00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:04,832
So, why are we back here?

00:16:04,832 --> 00:16:06,867
Did you miss something
the first time?

00:16:06,867 --> 00:16:08,502
Yes. Context.

00:16:08,502 --> 00:16:10,537
As your people
were obscuring it.

00:16:10,537 --> 00:16:13,073
We now know that someone
brought a super-gun

00:16:13,073 --> 00:16:14,842
to an expert.

00:16:14,842 --> 00:16:16,944
And that expert was then
shot by the same weapon,

00:16:16,944 --> 00:16:18,545
in his kitchen,
and he was wrapped

00:16:18,545 --> 00:16:20,681
in a shower curtain
and he was brought here.

00:16:20,681 --> 00:16:21,849
McQUAID:
Where he was shot again.

00:16:21,849 --> 00:16:23,517
And again.

00:16:23,517 --> 00:16:24,685
Why the overkill?

00:16:24,685 --> 00:16:26,019
Well, maybe it
wasn't overkill.

00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:27,654
I mean, based
on the grouping

00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:30,424
and the volume, my guess is
he zippered him.

00:16:30,424 --> 00:16:32,893
Zippered? Is that
what it sounds like?

00:16:32,893 --> 00:16:34,895
If a weapon's cyclic rate
is fast enough

00:16:34,895 --> 00:16:36,663
and the ammo's nasty enough...

00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:39,166
<i>you can actually rip</i>
<i>right through a man.</i>

00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:45,639
<i>Open him up...</i>

00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:47,908
<i>like a zipper.</i>

00:16:47,908 --> 00:16:50,777
But why halve a man
after the fact?

00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:59,520
WILLOWS:
I'm thinking,

00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,955
ease of transport.

00:17:03,056 --> 00:17:04,057
(camera shutter clicks)

00:17:04,057 --> 00:17:05,959
A whole body...

00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:08,862
wouldn't fit inside
one of these garbage bags.

00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:10,731
They're too small.

00:17:10,731 --> 00:17:12,165
Okay.

00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:16,570
So the killer...

00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:19,573
shreds the shower curtain,
hauling the body out here...

00:17:19,573 --> 00:17:21,575
and he still needs
to move it.

00:17:21,575 --> 00:17:24,645
Right. The tire treads
that we cast in the driveway

00:17:24,645 --> 00:17:27,481
match to a Dodge pickup,
so perhaps the killer

00:17:27,481 --> 00:17:30,417
zippers, stuffs,
ties and throws

00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:32,619
two bags of carcass
into his truck bed.

00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:34,721
And gets away without a trace.

00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:37,491
You know, I see idiots
using garbage bags

00:17:37,491 --> 00:17:39,826
for body disposals all the time.

00:17:42,095 --> 00:17:44,398
<i>And they almost always leak.</i>

00:17:54,942 --> 00:17:56,810
WILLOWS:
Directional blood drop.

00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:58,779
Its spine is telling me

00:17:58,779 --> 00:18:01,381
that he went that way.

00:18:07,955 --> 00:18:10,390
Thank you.
Un-redacted.

00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,559
So much easier to read.

00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:16,597
Why don't you
walk me through this.
Four weeks ago

00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:18,532
in Pakistan, a warehouse
guard was killed

00:18:18,532 --> 00:18:20,968
trying to stop a raid
on U.S. military supplies.

00:18:20,968 --> 00:18:24,571
Using that same gun,
the FN-P90?

00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:27,474
According to
the ballistics report.

00:18:27,474 --> 00:18:29,543
RUSSELL:
So, when we ran
that bullet through

00:18:29,543 --> 00:18:31,945
the military database,
it raised a red flag
on your end, right?

00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:33,614
That's why you're here?

00:18:33,614 --> 00:18:35,616
To be frank, it's the
only flag that we've had.

00:18:35,616 --> 00:18:38,452
I mean, we never recovered
any supplies and didn't
find the shooter.

00:18:38,452 --> 00:18:40,153
Who did the work-up
on this for you?

00:18:40,153 --> 00:18:43,557
Are you familiar with the term
"battlefield forensics"?

00:18:43,557 --> 00:18:46,059
That's CSI on speed, right?

00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:48,762
Except people are dropping bombs
on you and shooting at you.

00:18:48,762 --> 00:18:50,464
This scene in Pakistan
was processed

00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:52,666
by operatives working
for Ceressus Logistics.

00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:55,068
It's a U.S.
military contractor.
Yeah.

00:18:55,068 --> 00:18:56,703
They handle most of
the law enforcement

00:18:56,703 --> 00:18:58,505
in our overseas
operations, right?

00:18:58,505 --> 00:19:02,576
Well, as well as police
training, supplies,
transportation,

00:19:02,576 --> 00:19:04,378
artillery, food service,
you name it.

00:19:04,378 --> 00:19:06,079
And you think that those
people at Ceressus

00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:08,048
are the ones who
stole your supplies?

00:19:08,048 --> 00:19:11,418
I didn't say that.
No, you didn't
have to, though.

00:19:11,418 --> 00:19:13,420
I mean, if that gun was
taken by an insurgent,

00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,155
it wouldn't have
ended up in Nevada.

00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:18,925
But it did-- so you got to be
thinking inside job, right?

00:19:18,925 --> 00:19:21,728
I mean, there's no
evidence to support that.

00:19:21,728 --> 00:19:24,965
Forget about evidence,
just for a second.

00:19:24,965 --> 00:19:27,167
What's your gut tell you?

00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:30,537
It tells me that someone at
Ceressus could be behind this,

00:19:30,537 --> 00:19:33,874
but I can't accuse one
of our law enforcement
partners of theft

00:19:33,874 --> 00:19:35,409
without having any proof.

00:19:35,409 --> 00:19:36,777
No, you can't.

00:19:36,777 --> 00:19:38,645
But what the heck, we
can talk to them, right?

00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:40,847
I mean, there was a
crime scene in Pakistan--

00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:43,717
we'd be just doing
our due diligence.

00:19:43,717 --> 00:19:45,452
Don't you think?

00:19:45,452 --> 00:19:47,688
WILLOWS:
<i>Your boss is</i>

00:19:47,688 --> 00:19:49,089
kind of young.

00:19:49,089 --> 00:19:50,557
He's not my boss.

00:19:50,557 --> 00:19:52,159
He's my replacement.

00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:55,162
I'm training him till I
de-camp the Las Vegas office.

00:19:55,162 --> 00:19:57,464
On to bigger
and better things?

00:19:57,464 --> 00:20:00,133
Mm, I don't know
about better.

00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:02,502
More important,
I suppose.

00:20:02,502 --> 00:20:03,804
More dangerous.

00:20:03,804 --> 00:20:06,406
More dangerous?
Really? Where?

00:20:07,974 --> 00:20:10,844
Your boss, he said
you were him before he was.

00:20:10,844 --> 00:20:12,379
What's that about?

00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:14,948
The technical term
is "demotion."

00:20:14,948 --> 00:20:17,117
Good girl does bad. So what,
are you just biding your time

00:20:17,117 --> 00:20:18,852
till you can rise
to that top spot again?

00:20:18,852 --> 00:20:21,688
I'm not sure I want it anymore.

00:20:21,688 --> 00:20:23,623
So what <i>do</i> you want?

00:20:23,623 --> 00:20:25,592
Right now?

00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:30,530
I want more blood drops.

00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:33,033
Haven't seen any in the
past couple hundred yards.

00:20:33,033 --> 00:20:35,569
The trail's run dry.
Maybe not.

00:20:37,104 --> 00:20:39,439
This is McQuaid.

00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:41,441
Let's get our cadets out here
to walk the line ASAP.

00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:44,511
I want a couple of FLIR
helicopters up in the air,

00:20:44,511 --> 00:20:46,747
and mobilize half a dozen
canine units, right now.

00:20:46,747 --> 00:20:48,448
I'm impressed.

00:20:48,448 --> 00:20:50,650
But you can call off your dogs.

00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,119
I got vultures.

00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:54,454
(vultures squawking)

00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:11,138
Mike Newbury, I presume?

00:21:11,138 --> 00:21:12,939
WILLOWS: Looks like our
feathered friends found him

00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:14,975
a few hours before we did.

00:21:14,975 --> 00:21:17,677
Good call on the zippering.

00:21:20,647 --> 00:21:23,683
That's the beer bottle
that made our ring.

00:21:23,683 --> 00:21:25,685
Check this out.

00:21:25,685 --> 00:21:28,622
Ink. I think.

00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:32,025
It's a tattoo...

00:21:32,025 --> 00:21:34,027
but sadly...

00:21:34,027 --> 00:21:36,797
it's mangled
beyond recognition.

00:21:36,797 --> 00:21:38,532
On purpose, right?

00:21:38,532 --> 00:21:40,400
Look at the vulture nips

00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,802
on the rest of the body.

00:21:41,802 --> 00:21:43,537
The skin is pulled.

00:21:43,537 --> 00:21:45,605
These cuts here are clean,
like they came

00:21:45,605 --> 00:21:47,040
from a blade of sorts.

00:21:51,011 --> 00:21:52,479
Or...

00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:54,414
Huh.
A shattered

00:21:54,414 --> 00:21:56,449
beer bottle.

00:21:56,449 --> 00:21:58,451
Killer wanted
to obscure this tattoo.

00:21:58,451 --> 00:21:59,553
Mission accomplished.

00:21:59,553 --> 00:22:01,555
We can't tell
what it was now.

00:22:01,555 --> 00:22:04,024
No, not in this
current state.

00:22:04,024 --> 00:22:06,793
But that's the thing
about tattoos.

00:22:06,793 --> 00:22:09,029
You better be sure,
'cause they're forever.

00:22:09,029 --> 00:22:11,765
Doc, can I take this part to go?

00:22:11,765 --> 00:22:13,700
No, not yet,
but we deliver.

00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:19,005
Isn't this the questioned
documents area?

00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:20,574
Why, yes, it is.

00:22:20,574 --> 00:22:22,542
And this is the
Video-Spectral Comparator.

00:22:22,542 --> 00:22:24,611
We use it on worn
or altered papers

00:22:24,611 --> 00:22:28,415
to isolate one part
of the color spectrum at a time.

00:22:28,415 --> 00:22:30,917
You're going to
put this in there?

00:22:30,917 --> 00:22:32,152
Uh-huh.

00:22:32,152 --> 00:22:33,854
Okay.

00:22:33,854 --> 00:22:35,989
A tattoo's ink goes
down to the dermis, right?

00:22:35,989 --> 00:22:37,490
Uh-huh.

00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:40,160
So, if we adjust

00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,762
to look for different
ink colors...

00:22:42,762 --> 00:22:44,531
You can pull out
the tattoo fragments

00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:45,932
one color at a time.

00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:49,836
BRASS:
<i>Mr. Gabriel, I have to say,</i>

00:22:49,836 --> 00:22:52,939
that when we asked to speak
to a representative of Ceressus,

00:22:52,939 --> 00:22:55,475
I didn't expect the CEO.

00:22:55,475 --> 00:22:56,877
I take my job seriously,
Captain,

00:22:56,877 --> 00:22:59,446
and my job, above all,
is to serve my country,

00:22:59,446 --> 00:23:00,647
so, whatever you need,

00:23:00,647 --> 00:23:02,849
I want you
to have it.
Mm.

00:23:02,849 --> 00:23:04,584
Very much appreciated, sir.

00:23:04,584 --> 00:23:05,952
Uh, Mr. Gabriel,
your Battlefield Forensics Team

00:23:05,952 --> 00:23:08,488
processed a crime
scene in Pakistan,

00:23:08,488 --> 00:23:09,789
and a gun was
implicated.

00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:12,792
And then, the same gun
showed up stateside,

00:23:12,792 --> 00:23:15,896
last night, in this
mysterious homicide.

00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:17,163
Any idea how
that might have happened?

00:23:17,163 --> 00:23:18,899
I can't speak to the scene here,

00:23:18,899 --> 00:23:20,967
but I read my guys' report
on my plane.

00:23:20,967 --> 00:23:23,136
Seems pretty straightforward.
Insurgent raid, right?

00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:24,671
What about your men over there?

00:23:24,671 --> 00:23:26,439
You know them well?

00:23:26,439 --> 00:23:28,642
You trust them?
I run a tight ship.

00:23:28,642 --> 00:23:31,578
I hire only the best, only after
excessive background checks.

00:23:31,578 --> 00:23:32,579
In fact, I've had to say no

00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:33,880
to police,

00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,448
even FBI agents.

00:23:35,448 --> 00:23:36,449
RUSSELL:
Yeah, but

00:23:36,449 --> 00:23:37,884
it's like the wild west

00:23:37,884 --> 00:23:39,052
out there, right? I mean,

00:23:39,052 --> 00:23:40,453
a war zone.

00:23:40,453 --> 00:23:42,555
Rules go flying
out the window.

00:23:42,555 --> 00:23:44,057
Any chance
somebody did something

00:23:44,057 --> 00:23:45,492
they weren't supposed to?

00:23:45,492 --> 00:23:47,060
What are you saying exactly?

00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,396
It must be very tempting,
that's all.

00:23:49,396 --> 00:23:52,399
You know, your people have
a certain window of time

00:23:52,399 --> 00:23:54,134
where they can do
as they please.

00:23:54,134 --> 00:23:55,835
You know,
take anything they want.

00:23:55,835 --> 00:23:56,970
Like those guns,

00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:59,472
for example,
and they certainly have

00:23:59,472 --> 00:24:03,109
unlimited resources to cart them
anywhere they want in the world.

00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:07,514
My people do exactly
what yours do, Mr. Russell,

00:24:07,514 --> 00:24:09,482
but without the luxury of time

00:24:09,482 --> 00:24:11,484
or security.
Hmm.

00:24:11,484 --> 00:24:13,920
Let me go back
a second here.

00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,657
Didn't you just say,
"I read it on my plane?"

00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:23,096
Kind of hard to get a,
you know, a lecture on luxury

00:24:23,096 --> 00:24:24,998
from somebody
who just used the words,

00:24:24,998 --> 00:24:27,167
"I read it on my plane,"
you know.

00:24:27,167 --> 00:24:28,702
Muddies things,
that's all.

00:24:28,702 --> 00:24:30,403
Then let me be clear.

00:24:30,403 --> 00:24:31,538
Yeah. Please.

00:24:31,538 --> 00:24:32,839
The sort of corruption

00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:34,374
you're implying
is neither encouraged

00:24:34,374 --> 00:24:35,408
nor tolerated at Ceressus.

00:24:35,408 --> 00:24:36,576
Clear?

00:24:40,947 --> 00:24:43,583
Laura?

00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:46,453
Catherine!

00:24:46,453 --> 00:24:47,587
Oh, my God.

00:24:47,587 --> 00:24:50,757
What are you
doing here?

00:24:50,757 --> 00:24:52,859
Laura and I
were friends...

00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:54,561
Way too many years ago
to say aloud.

00:24:54,561 --> 00:24:55,729
Do you work here?

00:24:55,729 --> 00:24:57,397
Uh, the crime lab.
Law enforcement.

00:24:57,397 --> 00:24:58,732
Really?
Yeah.

00:24:58,732 --> 00:25:00,533
You?
Yeah, well, it's
a long story.

00:25:00,533 --> 00:25:02,068
What are you
doing here?

00:25:02,068 --> 00:25:03,803
My husband is helping out
on a case

00:25:03,803 --> 00:25:05,038
with the police and the FBI.

00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:06,906
Your husband's Mark Gabriel?

00:25:06,906 --> 00:25:08,441
I'm sorry. Who are you?

00:25:08,441 --> 00:25:10,010
Agent McQuaid. FBI.

00:25:11,611 --> 00:25:14,447
You look great.

00:25:14,447 --> 00:25:16,783
It's been 20 years, and I can
still tell when you're lying.

00:25:16,783 --> 00:25:19,619
22, and you still can't take
a compliment.

00:25:19,619 --> 00:25:21,421
(laughs)

00:25:21,421 --> 00:25:23,556
Laura.

00:25:23,556 --> 00:25:25,492
(clears throat)
I got to go.

00:25:25,492 --> 00:25:27,460
(phone rings)
Oh, hey, um,

00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,529
are you in town
for a while?

00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:31,164
A day or two.
Do you have any free time?

00:25:31,164 --> 00:25:33,566
Yes. Get ahold of me here.

00:25:33,566 --> 00:25:34,734
MARK:
Laura, today.

00:25:34,734 --> 00:25:36,403
Hey, Nicky, what's up?

00:25:36,403 --> 00:25:38,505
STOKES: Well, I got good news,
and I got bad news.

00:25:38,505 --> 00:25:42,675
The good news is,
I think I found our gun.

00:25:42,675 --> 00:25:44,511
Great. And the bad news?

00:25:53,787 --> 00:25:54,954
16-year-old kid comes in

00:25:54,954 --> 00:25:56,790
to rob the place.

00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:59,959
And the clerk must have
sneezed, and the kid's weapon

00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:01,795
spits out about 50
of your magic rounds.

00:26:01,795 --> 00:26:04,397
Shooter said he found
it behind a Dumpster

00:26:04,397 --> 00:26:05,565
at D Street
and Barlow.

00:26:05,565 --> 00:26:06,766
Anybody else hurt?

00:26:06,766 --> 00:26:08,468
Hell, yeah.
Clerk took half a dozen.

00:26:08,468 --> 00:26:10,737
He's en route to the E.R. now.

00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:13,573
And the rifleman over there
literally shot himself

00:26:13,573 --> 00:26:14,707
in the foot.

00:26:14,707 --> 00:26:16,409
I'm just glad he
ran out of ammo.

00:26:17,944 --> 00:26:19,746
Think it was a little bit
too much gun for him.

00:26:19,746 --> 00:26:20,880
Would be for me, too.

00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,749
That thing's a monster.

00:26:22,749 --> 00:26:24,150
Glad it's off the street.

00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:26,086
Okay, see you later.

00:26:29,422 --> 00:26:30,657
(chuckling):
Okay.

00:26:30,657 --> 00:26:32,926
What's the matter?

00:26:32,926 --> 00:26:36,563
If that one weapon got out,
there may be more to follow.

00:26:36,563 --> 00:26:38,765
Those are the stolen supplies
you were talking about?

00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:40,733
That's the problem
we're here to fix.

00:26:40,733 --> 00:26:43,670
That gun?
The cuts-people-in-half gun?

00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:45,905
Well, how many we talking
about? Give me a number.

00:26:45,905 --> 00:26:47,640
144.

00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,109
144 of these?!

00:26:50,376 --> 00:26:52,145
That's not a problem.

00:26:52,145 --> 00:26:54,080
That's a... that's a war zone.

00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,921
You find anything?

00:27:01,921 --> 00:27:03,590
Afraid not.

00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:04,858
Okay.
No, no,
wait, wait.

00:27:04,858 --> 00:27:06,426
I found
"a frayed knot."

00:27:06,426 --> 00:27:08,394
A thread that's been tied
into a knot.

00:27:08,394 --> 00:27:09,729
It was snagged
in the magazine well.

00:27:09,729 --> 00:27:11,798
And it's... it's

00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:13,666
frayed.

00:27:13,666 --> 00:27:15,568
The thread is wool,

00:27:15,568 --> 00:27:16,936
made from refined
camel hair.

00:27:16,936 --> 00:27:19,139
And the knot is
not just any knot.

00:27:19,139 --> 00:27:20,707
It's the asymmetrical
Sennah knot,

00:27:20,707 --> 00:27:23,543
a Persian knot
specifically used in finer rugs.

00:27:23,543 --> 00:27:27,013
See, the thread is wrapped
around only one warp,

00:27:27,013 --> 00:27:29,949
and then it's passed behind
to the adjacent warp,

00:27:29,949 --> 00:27:32,785
which divides the two ends,
right?

00:27:32,785 --> 00:27:34,454
So, these types of rugs

00:27:34,454 --> 00:27:36,789
that are woven
with this knot are generally...

00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:38,691
You're welcome.

00:27:38,691 --> 00:27:40,960
SIDLE: Took a little luck and a
lot of computer enhancement,

00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,028
but this eagle
has finally landed.

00:27:42,028 --> 00:27:43,663
It's military.

00:27:43,663 --> 00:27:45,465
Skeleton with a beret.
That's definitely military.

00:27:45,465 --> 00:27:46,599
The bird's Airborne.

00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:48,601
WILLOWS:
532?

00:27:48,601 --> 00:27:49,936
532nd Division.

00:27:49,936 --> 00:27:51,538
Killer purposefully
carved out this tattoo

00:27:51,538 --> 00:27:52,672
with the beer bottle.

00:27:52,672 --> 00:27:53,907
Why?

00:27:53,907 --> 00:27:55,041
Something to hide?

00:27:55,041 --> 00:27:56,609
Maybe he had the same tattoo.

00:27:56,609 --> 00:27:59,379
Same division.
A brother in arms.

00:27:59,379 --> 00:28:00,747
Someone you'd share a beer with.

00:28:00,747 --> 00:28:02,415
PRATT:
<i>Okay, Persian carpets,</i>

00:28:02,415 --> 00:28:03,950
plus, Army tattoo.

00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:05,418
How does that equal
gun runner?

00:28:05,418 --> 00:28:06,886
Hey, you know what?

00:28:06,886 --> 00:28:10,823
Cross-reference the
532nd Airborne with locals.

00:28:10,823 --> 00:28:13,159
You drop a gun off at D
street and Barlow Ave,

00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:15,595
I'm thinking you know
that neighborhood pretty well.

00:28:15,595 --> 00:28:16,896
Maybe even lived there.

00:28:16,896 --> 00:28:18,665
Yeah, that gives us
14 candidates

00:28:18,665 --> 00:28:20,433
that served
while Newbury was active.

00:28:20,433 --> 00:28:21,467
RUSSELL:
Any of them drive

00:28:21,467 --> 00:28:22,502
a Dodge pickup?

00:28:25,705 --> 00:28:28,474
WILLOWS:
Bingo. Lenny Wesson.

00:28:28,474 --> 00:28:30,743
I got him. Yeah, he grew up
in the alphabets.

00:28:30,743 --> 00:28:32,445
Dishonorably discharged.

00:28:32,445 --> 00:28:34,514
Went the way of the rap sheet.

00:28:34,514 --> 00:28:36,482
Catches work
as an independent truck driver.

00:28:36,482 --> 00:28:39,886
He drives a '97
Peterbilt semi.

00:28:39,886 --> 00:28:41,554
But he doesn't work
for Ceressus.

00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:42,889
But he wouldn't.
He's not smart enough.

00:28:42,889 --> 00:28:44,390
Remember? "Only the
brightest and the best."

00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:46,960
Background checks.
Blah, blah, blah.

00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,729
Now, you know, I think
Lenny may be our weak link.

00:28:49,729 --> 00:28:51,965
So someone from Ceressus boosts
the guns in Pakistan,

00:28:51,965 --> 00:28:54,968
brings them into the country,
and he's got to move them.

00:28:54,968 --> 00:28:56,502
He calls an ex-foxhole buddy.

00:28:56,502 --> 00:28:57,904
They ask Lenny
the truck driver

00:28:57,904 --> 00:28:59,372
to haul some cargo.

00:28:59,372 --> 00:29:00,974
Haul some Persian
carpets maybe.

00:29:00,974 --> 00:29:03,576
And maybe Lenny got a look
at what he was really lugging.

00:29:03,576 --> 00:29:05,111
He took 'em to an expert to see

00:29:05,111 --> 00:29:07,013
exactly what he had.
McQUAID:
What he still has.

00:29:07,013 --> 00:29:10,149
Until he unloads 'em,
which could be right now.

00:29:10,149 --> 00:29:11,951
We got to find
Lenny and his truck.

00:29:11,951 --> 00:29:14,387
Lucky for us, we have the
weight of the FBI behind us.

00:29:14,387 --> 00:29:15,588
Come on, B.Y.U.

00:29:15,588 --> 00:29:16,889
If you want to throw
some weight around,

00:29:16,889 --> 00:29:18,524
now's the time.

00:29:18,524 --> 00:29:22,996
It's nice, all our kids
playing so well together.

00:29:22,996 --> 00:29:24,631
It's called a
citizen broadcast.

00:29:24,631 --> 00:29:26,766
We set it up with
DHS after 9/11.

00:29:26,766 --> 00:29:29,035
Pretty much puts us into contact
with every private company

00:29:29,035 --> 00:29:31,738
on the road-- UPS, FedEx,
trucking companies.

00:29:31,738 --> 00:29:33,673
All eyes on the road
become our eyes.

00:29:33,673 --> 00:29:36,109
RUSSELL:
Like CB radio
on steroids.

00:29:36,109 --> 00:29:38,111
What's a CB radio?

00:29:38,111 --> 00:29:39,145
I was joking.

00:29:39,145 --> 00:29:40,413
Got something!

00:29:40,413 --> 00:29:42,115
Driver spotted...

00:29:42,115 --> 00:29:44,517
suspect Wesson going eastbound

00:29:44,517 --> 00:29:46,152
in a green Peterbilt semi
on Route 164.

00:29:46,152 --> 00:29:49,055
(sirens blaring)

00:29:57,096 --> 00:29:59,432
(phone chirping)

00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:05,872
(tires squeal)

00:30:05,872 --> 00:30:08,408
What are you doing?

00:30:08,408 --> 00:30:11,010
Busted a dozen arms exchanges
from Honduras to Somalia,

00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:13,146
and by definition,
both sides are armed,

00:30:13,146 --> 00:30:14,814
which makes
everyone paranoid.

00:30:14,814 --> 00:30:16,716
Still not following
why you turned off the road.

00:30:16,716 --> 00:30:18,651
Because most of these things,
in my experience,

00:30:18,651 --> 00:30:20,787
take place in public,
hiding in plain sight.

00:30:20,787 --> 00:30:23,456
Oh, and if you want to hide
a truck in plain sight,

00:30:23,456 --> 00:30:24,891
there's one obvious place
to do it.

00:30:33,132 --> 00:30:35,034
Plate's a match.

00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:42,508
Special Agent McQuaid,
requesting backup--

00:30:42,508 --> 00:30:45,044
truck stop at mile
marker one-two-five.

00:30:45,044 --> 00:30:46,579
DISPATCH:
Confirming mile marker
one-two-five.

00:30:46,579 --> 00:30:47,513
Sending backup.

00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,936
Anybody in the market for a rug?

00:31:09,936 --> 00:31:11,971
I was imagining something
with a little more pop.

00:31:11,971 --> 00:31:15,141
From the looks of it, somebody
already took the guns.

00:31:15,141 --> 00:31:17,009
(muffled groaning)

00:31:22,048 --> 00:31:23,616
Lenny Wesson?
(muffled groans)

00:31:24,684 --> 00:31:25,952
Hey!

00:31:27,053 --> 00:31:28,087
Oh, crap!

00:31:28,087 --> 00:31:29,422
(guns cocking)

00:31:29,422 --> 00:31:30,423
Get down!

00:31:30,423 --> 00:31:32,024
(gunfire)

00:31:42,602 --> 00:31:43,703
(rapid gunfire)

00:31:43,703 --> 00:31:44,971
Grab him!

00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:48,508
(rapid gunfire continues)

00:31:51,444 --> 00:31:52,879
(grunts)

00:31:52,879 --> 00:31:54,380
(gunfire continues)

00:32:07,427 --> 00:32:08,694
(man groans)

00:32:10,163 --> 00:32:12,532
There's another one out there!

00:32:12,532 --> 00:32:15,535
(door opening)

00:32:17,437 --> 00:32:18,838
(sirens blaring)
It's all good!
It's all good!

00:32:18,838 --> 00:32:21,507
RUSSELL:
You okay?

00:32:23,576 --> 00:32:25,378
Yeah?

00:32:25,378 --> 00:32:26,846
Yeah. I'm good.

00:32:32,785 --> 00:32:34,887
AGENT: Looks like we got
the rest of the shipment.

00:32:43,029 --> 00:32:45,932
(sighs)

00:32:50,536 --> 00:32:52,071
McQUAID:
I guess we should thank you.

00:32:52,071 --> 00:32:54,807
You helped us
flush out some gunrunners

00:32:54,807 --> 00:32:57,076
that we were
looking for.

00:32:57,076 --> 00:32:59,779
Course they wouldn't have guns
to run, were it not for you.

00:32:59,779 --> 00:33:01,781
Not to mention the murder
of Michael Newbury.

00:33:01,781 --> 00:33:03,416
Mike who?

00:33:03,416 --> 00:33:04,984
I don't know what y'all
are talking about.

00:33:04,984 --> 00:33:07,587
I didn't even know there was
any guns in that truck.

00:33:07,587 --> 00:33:11,157
Your saliva and prints
are all over that bottle.

00:33:11,157 --> 00:33:12,758
You were smart enough to take it
from the crime scene,

00:33:12,758 --> 00:33:14,560
but stupid enough to leave it
with the body.

00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,062
McQUAID:
You served under Newbury,
for a whole tour.

00:33:16,062 --> 00:33:18,998
He invites you into his home
and then you kill him.

00:33:18,998 --> 00:33:19,932
Why?

00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:23,102
W...

00:33:23,102 --> 00:33:25,605
We were supposed to be brothers.

00:33:27,707 --> 00:33:29,075
All of us.

00:33:29,075 --> 00:33:31,844
And they go on...
to contracting jobs

00:33:31,844 --> 00:33:33,779
and consultant gigs.

00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:36,048
A bunch of them are working
for Ceressus now,

00:33:36,048 --> 00:33:37,717
and they're living
the good life.

00:33:37,717 --> 00:33:40,019
But a rising tide didn't lift
all boats.

00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:42,588
You fell on harder times.

00:33:42,588 --> 00:33:44,090
Yeah, I was always
the idiot kid brother.

00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:46,125
Okay?

00:33:46,125 --> 00:33:48,761
Finally, I get a score.

00:33:48,761 --> 00:33:51,731
<i>I brought the guns to Newbury</i>
<i>because I knew he knew guns.</i>

00:33:51,731 --> 00:33:53,599
It's great
to see you, man.

00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:55,101
<i>And at first he was happy</i>
<i>to help.</i>

00:33:55,101 --> 00:33:56,502
Hey, uh, you mind taking a look
at something?

00:33:56,502 --> 00:33:58,771
Sure, what do you got?

00:33:58,771 --> 00:33:59,839
Nice, huh?

00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:00,840
You want a beer?

00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,542
All right.

00:34:02,542 --> 00:34:04,443
<i>But as soon as he got his hands</i>
<i>on them guns,</i>

00:34:04,443 --> 00:34:05,444
<i>his whole mood changed.</i>

00:34:05,444 --> 00:34:06,779
Lenny...

00:34:06,779 --> 00:34:08,648
these guns were stolen
from the military.

00:34:08,648 --> 00:34:11,617
This is serious trouble.

00:34:11,617 --> 00:34:13,619
I'll tell you what.

00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:15,788
I'll return them for you.

00:34:15,788 --> 00:34:16,889
Anonymously.

00:34:18,124 --> 00:34:19,692
Okay?

00:34:19,692 --> 00:34:20,893
<i>I had bills to pay.</i>

00:34:20,893 --> 00:34:22,528
Take this.

00:34:29,535 --> 00:34:31,404
They all got
their golden tickets.

00:34:31,404 --> 00:34:33,372
Well, these guns were mine.

00:34:33,372 --> 00:34:34,807
They weren't your guns, Lenny.

00:34:34,807 --> 00:34:35,908
They were stolen.

00:34:35,908 --> 00:34:37,944
We know you were just
a middleman.

00:34:37,944 --> 00:34:41,514
Who threw you
the driving gig?

00:34:41,514 --> 00:34:42,815
Was it another
ex-Ranger?

00:34:42,815 --> 00:34:44,150
Someone from
Ceressus?

00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,751
You think I'm a rat?

00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:47,420
We know that Ceressus
is implicated;

00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:48,654
we just want to know how far up
the ladder it goes.

00:34:48,654 --> 00:34:51,657
Yeah, well, you know so much...

00:34:51,657 --> 00:34:53,392
what do you need me for?

00:34:53,392 --> 00:34:55,094
We need someone to say it
in court.

00:34:57,396 --> 00:34:58,898
You cooperate,

00:34:58,898 --> 00:35:01,834
maybe we could shave a few years
off your sentence.

00:35:01,834 --> 00:35:03,502
Years?

00:35:03,502 --> 00:35:05,037
Years?

00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:10,076
If I tell you everything...

00:35:10,076 --> 00:35:12,745
everyone involved...

00:35:12,745 --> 00:35:13,846
I want immunity.

00:35:13,846 --> 00:35:15,081
Immunity?

00:35:15,081 --> 00:35:16,482
Protection from-from-from
it all.

00:35:16,482 --> 00:35:17,750
You killed a man,
Lenny.

00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:19,452
You put those guns
out on the street.

00:35:19,452 --> 00:35:20,953
Immunity?

00:35:20,953 --> 00:35:22,855
Forget it.
That's not going to happen.

00:35:22,855 --> 00:35:24,857
Actually...

00:35:24,857 --> 00:35:27,760
it is.

00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,029
If you can give us the names
of all of your contacts

00:35:30,029 --> 00:35:33,766
and it turns into
something substantial.

00:35:33,766 --> 00:35:35,134
Wh-What are you doing?

00:35:35,134 --> 00:35:37,036
You can't decide...
Yes, we can.

00:35:37,036 --> 00:35:38,871
Good.

00:35:38,871 --> 00:35:40,006
I'm sorry,
I gotta pull rank here.

00:35:40,006 --> 00:35:41,841
I'm going to
need a lawyer

00:35:41,841 --> 00:35:43,409
to draw up the papers before
I say a single word to y'all.

00:35:43,409 --> 00:35:44,543
Okay.

00:35:44,543 --> 00:35:45,645
Whatever you need.

00:35:52,385 --> 00:35:54,787
Why the change in venue?

00:35:54,787 --> 00:35:58,958
Well, this interview is a little
less informal than our last.

00:35:58,958 --> 00:36:01,460
Am I under suspicion
for something?

00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:03,863
No. I mean,
not you specifically.

00:36:03,863 --> 00:36:05,131
Yet.

00:36:05,131 --> 00:36:06,666
This is the beginning
of an official inquiry

00:36:06,666 --> 00:36:08,534
of Ceressus.

00:36:08,534 --> 00:36:09,602
We just wanted to give you

00:36:09,602 --> 00:36:12,471
the courtesy
of letting you know.

00:36:12,471 --> 00:36:14,740
And the opportunity to get on
the record sooner than later.

00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:16,008
Courtesy?

00:36:16,008 --> 00:36:17,943
Is that what this is?

00:36:17,943 --> 00:36:20,980
Look, I know you have free rein
on your global turf,

00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:24,050
but somebody in your outfit
brought those guns into mine

00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:25,518
and I want some answers.

00:36:25,518 --> 00:36:26,752
PRATT: We're gonna need
all of the names

00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:27,787
of the men involved

00:36:27,787 --> 00:36:29,655
in that gun theft and then

00:36:29,655 --> 00:36:31,590
we're going to want access
to all of your personnel files.

00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:33,426
I'm not giving you anything
but politeness.

00:36:33,426 --> 00:36:36,495
To be honest with you, I'm
running out of that fast.

00:36:36,495 --> 00:36:37,730
Yeah. Mr. Gabriel...

00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:38,964
If you want to make
demands of me,

00:36:38,964 --> 00:36:41,701
have your boss's
boss call me.

00:36:41,701 --> 00:36:44,804
Otherwise, I'm done here.

00:36:45,905 --> 00:36:47,406
Actually, you know what?

00:36:47,406 --> 00:36:48,841
There's one more thing.

00:36:48,841 --> 00:36:50,142
What's that?

00:36:50,142 --> 00:36:53,979
You see, all these guns
that are now Stateside

00:36:53,979 --> 00:36:57,149
have to go back to the troops
in Afghanistan.

00:36:57,149 --> 00:36:58,918
You know, given
your resources,

00:36:58,918 --> 00:37:00,986
and your patriotism...

00:37:00,986 --> 00:37:03,389
That's going to cost me
half a million dollars.

00:37:03,389 --> 00:37:05,758
Oh, at least.

00:37:05,758 --> 00:37:07,393
Thanks for your time.

00:37:15,534 --> 00:37:17,436
LAURA:
Your daughter is beautiful.

00:37:17,436 --> 00:37:20,773
She is, isn't she?

00:37:20,773 --> 00:37:22,575
I'm jealous.

00:37:22,575 --> 00:37:23,576
Jealous?

00:37:23,576 --> 00:37:26,512
Laura, look at you.

00:37:26,512 --> 00:37:28,547
The good life, the
billionaire husband.

00:37:28,547 --> 00:37:30,583
You got it all.

00:37:31,984 --> 00:37:33,753
So how is your mom?

00:37:37,623 --> 00:37:39,391
Laura...

00:37:40,526 --> 00:37:42,528
...why are you here?

00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:45,097
To catch up,
just like we talked about.

00:37:45,097 --> 00:37:48,534
Which has been great.
Really.

00:37:48,534 --> 00:37:50,536
But...

00:37:50,536 --> 00:37:52,805
I just have this feeling
that there's something

00:37:52,805 --> 00:37:55,775
you want to say.

00:37:55,775 --> 00:37:57,143
Is it about Mark?

00:37:57,143 --> 00:37:59,411
'Cause I saw the way
he talked to you.

00:37:59,411 --> 00:38:00,412
Does he hurt you?

00:38:00,412 --> 00:38:02,081
No. No, he doesn't.

00:38:02,081 --> 00:38:04,817
It's not...

00:38:06,752 --> 00:38:08,053
I heard something.

00:38:08,053 --> 00:38:09,789
By accident.

00:38:09,789 --> 00:38:11,423
What was it?

00:38:12,525 --> 00:38:14,527
(laughs)

00:38:14,527 --> 00:38:18,397
Okay, this is just me
being jet-lagged.

00:38:18,397 --> 00:38:20,666
I'm sorry.
I should go.

00:38:20,666 --> 00:38:22,835
But listen, um,

00:38:22,835 --> 00:38:26,906
it's been so nice
seeing you again.

00:38:26,906 --> 00:38:28,607
Hey, hang on.

00:38:28,607 --> 00:38:31,043
I just want to make sure you
have all my numbers, okay?

00:38:33,145 --> 00:38:34,780
Uh...

00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:37,483
Okay.

00:38:37,483 --> 00:38:38,984
All right.

00:38:38,984 --> 00:38:40,886
So I want you to call me
if you need anything.

00:38:40,886 --> 00:38:42,755
And I mean anything.

00:38:42,755 --> 00:38:45,758
Is there a reason you wrote this
on the back of a lawyer's card?

00:38:45,758 --> 00:38:47,660
Random coincidence.

00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,762
Coincidentally,
he's a good lawyer.

00:38:49,762 --> 00:38:52,031
He's Sam's guy.

00:38:52,031 --> 00:38:53,532
I think you might need that.

00:38:53,532 --> 00:38:55,100
Okay. Thanks.

00:38:57,570 --> 00:38:59,538
Okay. Thank you.

00:38:59,538 --> 00:39:01,874
All right. Bye.

00:39:08,047 --> 00:39:09,882
(knocking on door)

00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,956
Oh.

00:39:16,956 --> 00:39:18,624
Did you guys have
a good conversation?

00:39:18,624 --> 00:39:20,392
How long have you been
standing outside my house?

00:39:20,392 --> 00:39:21,527
Not important.

00:39:21,527 --> 00:39:22,728
I...

00:39:22,728 --> 00:39:23,829
The thing is...

00:39:25,064 --> 00:39:27,099
...I'm here--
my foot in the door,

00:39:27,099 --> 00:39:28,701
my hat in hand,

00:39:28,701 --> 00:39:30,636
a bottle in the other.

00:39:30,636 --> 00:39:32,504
It's beer.
It's Belgian.

00:39:32,504 --> 00:39:35,975
You know, guns aren't the only
thing they, uh, they make.

00:39:35,975 --> 00:39:38,477
I'd like to apologize.

00:39:38,477 --> 00:39:40,646
About the whole Lenny of it all.

00:39:40,646 --> 00:39:42,381
I blindsided you, and...

00:39:42,381 --> 00:39:43,515
It sucked.

00:39:43,515 --> 00:39:45,584
Yeah, it sucked.

00:39:45,584 --> 00:39:47,553
But it's the job.

00:39:47,553 --> 00:39:48,787
I have a job, too.

00:39:48,787 --> 00:39:50,789
And you did it
kind of perfectly.

00:39:50,789 --> 00:39:53,492
You got the guns back,
by way of vultures,

00:39:53,492 --> 00:39:55,094
and garbage bags
and whatnot.

00:39:55,094 --> 00:39:59,131
By "whatnot" you mean
saving your ass?

00:40:00,432 --> 00:40:01,667
I do.

00:40:07,606 --> 00:40:09,575
But the thing is,

00:40:09,575 --> 00:40:10,976
I had to cut a deal with Wesson.

00:40:10,976 --> 00:40:13,412
And I would do it again.

00:40:13,412 --> 00:40:15,547
This isn't much of an apology.

00:40:15,547 --> 00:40:18,951
But if I did it again,
I would tell you beforehand.

00:40:18,951 --> 00:40:20,386
You deserve that.

00:40:20,386 --> 00:40:21,820
At least that.

00:40:22,922 --> 00:40:25,424
Maybe more.

00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:33,565
(phone ringing)

00:40:36,969 --> 00:40:38,871
(cell phone ringing)

00:40:40,773 --> 00:40:42,675
Willows.

00:40:42,675 --> 00:40:44,476
McQuaid.

00:40:44,476 --> 00:40:47,646
Lenny Wesson died en route
to a federal holding facility.

00:40:47,646 --> 00:40:49,114
How?
Heart attack.

00:40:49,114 --> 00:40:50,749
Heart attack?
He was 37 years old.

00:40:50,749 --> 00:40:51,984
WILLOWS:
How did he die of
a heart attack?

00:40:51,984 --> 00:40:53,118
We need to run a tox panel.

00:40:53,118 --> 00:40:55,154
You won't find anything.

00:40:55,154 --> 00:40:59,858
What, you think that Mark
Gabriel is covering his tracks?

00:40:59,858 --> 00:41:01,994
I do, and I think he's
really good at it.

00:41:01,994 --> 00:41:03,062
Okay, so that's it?

00:41:03,062 --> 00:41:04,863
No, we gotta do something.

00:41:04,863 --> 00:41:06,699
McQUAID:
No, you guys did your job--

00:41:06,699 --> 00:41:08,067
the guns are
off the street.

00:41:08,067 --> 00:41:09,868
I think this is our
responsibility.

00:41:09,868 --> 00:41:11,837
Agent McQuaid and myself
are due back at Quantico.

00:41:11,837 --> 00:41:13,639
It's back to square one.

00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:15,441
It's been a real honor.

00:41:15,441 --> 00:41:17,009
Great work.
Thank you.

00:41:17,009 --> 00:41:18,510
Wait, whoa, wait,
hold it a second.

00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:21,814
I got a little going
away present for you.

00:41:21,814 --> 00:41:23,382
Is that a mushroom?

00:41:23,382 --> 00:41:24,750
<i>Hericium erinaceus.</i>

00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:26,485
"Lion's mane."

00:41:26,485 --> 00:41:27,853
It improves
cognitive function

00:41:27,853 --> 00:41:29,722
and promotes
well-being.

00:41:29,722 --> 00:41:32,658
I like just a little thin slice
on my toast in the morning.

00:41:32,658 --> 00:41:33,792
Thanks.

00:41:33,792 --> 00:41:36,128
I think.
(Russell chuckles)

00:41:37,763 --> 00:41:39,798
PRATT:
Uh...

00:41:39,798 --> 00:41:41,000
you sure you're
not just trying

00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,035
to ruin my drug screening?

00:41:43,035 --> 00:41:44,636
No, no.

00:41:44,636 --> 00:41:46,372
You should be all right
with that, I think.

00:41:46,372 --> 00:41:48,107
Yeah, pretty sure.

00:41:48,107 --> 00:41:49,808
CSI Willows,

00:41:49,808 --> 00:41:52,845
it has been, uh, a real
pleasure working with you.

00:41:52,845 --> 00:41:55,681
Likewise, Agent McQuaid.

00:41:57,549 --> 00:41:59,485
Good luck with the new job
and everything.

00:42:06,425 --> 00:42:08,994
RUSSELL:
Stay away from badges.

00:42:08,994 --> 00:42:10,662
I tell my daughter
every morning,

00:42:10,662 --> 00:42:12,965
"If he wears a badge,
he's wrong for you."

00:42:12,965 --> 00:42:14,867
Really?

00:42:14,867 --> 00:42:17,870
And what if your wife's father
had told her the same thing?

00:42:18,971 --> 00:42:21,673
Actually, he did.

00:42:21,673 --> 00:42:22,808
See you tomorrow.

00:42:22,808 --> 00:42:24,476
Regular time.
