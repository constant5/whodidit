Dearly beloved,

00:00:12,909 --> 00:00:16,012
we are gathered here today
to join Andrew Milner

00:00:16,012 --> 00:00:20,250
and Lisa Kravitz in
holy matrimony.

00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,052
Marriage is the
gift of all gifts.

00:00:23,052 --> 00:00:25,855
It is the promise
of all promises.

00:00:25,855 --> 00:00:29,259
It is commended to be
honorable among all men

00:00:29,259 --> 00:00:32,862
and should not be
entered into lightly,

00:00:32,862 --> 00:00:35,164

these two now come to be joined.

FINLEY:
Ugh, not me.

00:01:03,226 --> 00:01:05,094
The minute the
invitation comes, my feet hurt

00:01:05,094 --> 00:01:07,030
from the shoes
I'm going to have to wear.

00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:09,799

resist the unabashed

Hey, Conrad, whatcha got?

00:01:15,138 --> 00:01:17,874
ECKLIE: Two armed
assailants in full costume,

00:01:17,874 --> 00:01:20,209
took all the gifts, cash,
wallets, jewelry...

00:01:20,209 --> 00:01:21,978
Did anybody see
how they got away?

00:01:21,978 --> 00:01:24,414
No, three separate witnesses
called in the gunshots

00:01:24,414 --> 00:01:26,282
but nobody got eyes
on the getaway car.

00:01:26,282 --> 00:01:28,151
Response time?
Under five minutes.

00:01:28,151 --> 00:01:30,186
That's a small window
to do your thing.

uh, undersheriff,

00:01:34,857 --> 00:01:36,125
you're second in command.

00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:38,328
Well, I'm here
for two reasons.

00:01:38,328 --> 00:01:39,896
First, as the mayor
just reminded me

00:01:39,896 --> 00:01:41,764
there are 300 weddings
a day in Las Vegas,

00:01:41,764 --> 00:01:44,334
bringing millions of out of town
dollars into our economy.

00:01:44,334 --> 00:01:45,735
What's the second reason?

00:01:45,735 --> 00:01:47,070
This isn't just a robbery.

00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,471
It's a robbery homicide.

00:01:52,442 --> 00:01:54,477
Good Lord.

00:01:54,477 --> 00:01:57,180

Isn't there a...

00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,841

I found it.

Gunshot residue on the

Pattern puts it
at close range.

00:03:09,252 --> 00:03:13,056
So the groom was shot
execution-style,

00:03:13,056 --> 00:03:15,091
on his wedding day.

00:03:15,091 --> 00:03:16,859

I take it from your tone
that you don't either.

00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:24,267
I like weddings;
I've had two of them, but...

00:03:24,267 --> 00:03:27,103
marriages, they don't really
agree with me.

00:03:35,211 --> 00:03:36,946
If you think about it,
a wedding's

00:03:36,946 --> 00:03:38,147
a pretty good
place to rob, huh?

00:03:38,147 --> 00:03:41,184
You'd be the wedding
expert, I guess.

00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:43,419
Your mom's a multiple
offender too, you know.

00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:45,421
But her second one stuck.

00:03:47,957 --> 00:03:49,225
I noticed you're
light next week.

00:03:49,225 --> 00:03:50,860
You want to grab
a bite to eat?

00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,796
Next week's a ways away.

00:03:53,796 --> 00:03:56,265
We'll see.

00:04:06,976 --> 00:04:08,478
NANA OF THE BRIDE:
<i>It was a beautiful day,</i>

00:04:08,478 --> 00:04:10,446
<i>like a fairy tale.</i>

00:04:10,446 --> 00:04:12,782
Then, all of the sudden,
we hear gunshots,

00:04:12,782 --> 00:04:15,084
and we all turn and see this

00:04:15,084 --> 00:04:16,886
smiling cat and
this white rabbit.

00:04:16,886 --> 00:04:18,187
Like in the book?

00:04:18,187 --> 00:04:19,956
They didn't have
guns in the book.

00:04:19,956 --> 00:04:21,357
(gunshots, screaming)

00:04:21,357 --> 00:04:24,026
GUNMAN: Everybody up!
NANA: <i>They yelled.</i>

00:04:24,026 --> 00:04:25,795
<i>Told us to</i>
<i>take out our wallets,</i>

00:04:25,795 --> 00:04:27,930
<i>our phones, our jewelry,</i>

00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:29,932
<i>they even pulled off my brooch.</i>

00:04:29,932 --> 00:04:32,268
Well, we'll see what we can do
about getting that back for you.

00:04:32,268 --> 00:04:33,469
I'm sorry.

00:04:33,469 --> 00:04:34,904
Thank you.
All right.

00:04:34,904 --> 00:04:36,739
They split up
as soon as they got in.

00:04:36,739 --> 00:04:38,141
The rabbit gathered up
all the gifts.

00:04:38,141 --> 00:04:39,976
<i>They just barked out orders.</i>

00:04:39,976 --> 00:04:42,778
<i>And assured everybody that it</i>
<i>would all be over soon.</i>

00:04:42,778 --> 00:04:44,313
<i>And for a while, it seemed</i>
<i>like it would be.</i>

00:04:44,313 --> 00:04:46,215
<i>Then there was that scuffle.</i>
(people arguing)

00:04:46,215 --> 00:04:47,416
Move!

00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:49,085
What kind of a scuffle?

00:04:49,085 --> 00:04:50,520
I don't know, it was on the
other side of the crowd.

00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,954
I didn't get a good look.

00:04:51,954 --> 00:04:53,189
Can you think
of anyone that did?

00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:54,390
(sighs heavily)

00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,492
Go ask Alice.

00:04:57,927 --> 00:05:01,097
Andrew and I met
in an English class--

00:05:01,097 --> 00:05:03,966
Literature of the Absurd,

00:05:03,966 --> 00:05:06,502
and <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>
kind of became our thing,

00:05:06,502 --> 00:05:08,871
our way of saying
"I love you."

00:05:10,273 --> 00:05:11,841
It's stupid. I know.

00:05:11,841 --> 00:05:13,976
No, no, I think
that's very sweet.

00:05:13,976 --> 00:05:15,945
When he proposed,

00:05:15,945 --> 00:05:19,482
on the table was a bottle
labeled "drink me,"

00:05:19,482 --> 00:05:22,084
a cake labeled "eat me,"

00:05:22,084 --> 00:05:25,188
and this antique engagement
ring labeled "marry me."

00:05:25,188 --> 00:05:27,123
So, when the rabbit
came for the ring...

00:05:27,123 --> 00:05:28,824
I couldn't let go of it.

00:05:28,824 --> 00:05:31,894
<i>The rabbit got angry</i>
<i>and hit me in the leg</i>

00:05:31,894 --> 00:05:34,430
<i>with the end of his gun.</i>
<i>Andrews very protective of me.</i>

00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:36,232
<i>And he didn't even slow down</i>

00:05:36,232 --> 00:05:38,134
<i>when there was</i>
<i>a gun to his head.</i>

00:05:38,134 --> 00:05:40,136
(all screaming)

00:05:40,136 --> 00:05:42,838
He saw me...

00:05:42,838 --> 00:05:44,740
before the wedding.

00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,275
(sobbing):
It's bad luck.

00:05:46,275 --> 00:05:48,477
Oh, I... I don't know.

00:05:48,477 --> 00:05:49,879
Ho, ho, ho, hey, listen to me.

00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:51,881
Listen to me. Listen to me.

00:05:51,881 --> 00:05:54,483
This was not your fault.
This was theirs.

00:05:54,483 --> 00:05:56,152
Okay?

00:05:56,152 --> 00:05:57,887
I'm going to be right back.

00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:01,190
CSI Finley's going to
stay with you here, okay?

00:06:02,992 --> 00:06:04,193
Mrs. Kravitz,

00:06:04,193 --> 00:06:05,528
can you show me where

00:06:05,528 --> 00:06:07,129
he hit you
with the gun?

00:06:15,304 --> 00:06:16,505
Find anything interesting?

00:06:16,505 --> 00:06:18,307
Found a little
of everything:

00:06:18,307 --> 00:06:21,010
old, new, borrowed,

00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:24,280
and hey, something blue.

00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,882
What do you think
that is?

00:06:26,882 --> 00:06:28,884
I have no idea.

00:06:28,884 --> 00:06:30,286
Let's get all this to Mandy.

00:06:30,286 --> 00:06:32,755
Our two robbers were
quick as a bunny.

00:06:32,755 --> 00:06:34,757
Maybe they got sloppy
and left a paw print.

00:06:34,757 --> 00:06:37,226
Hey... you got anything

00:06:37,226 --> 00:06:40,229
to calm down our bride
inside a little bit?

00:06:40,229 --> 00:06:41,497
PARAMEDIC:
Sure. Go ahead, Kyle.

00:06:41,497 --> 00:06:43,165
Okay.

00:06:43,165 --> 00:06:45,034
This is Haloperidol.

00:06:45,034 --> 00:06:46,836
Five mils should
take the edge off.

00:06:46,836 --> 00:06:48,037
Where is she?

00:06:48,037 --> 00:06:49,238
Dressing room.

00:06:49,238 --> 00:06:51,240

Oh, no, it's okay.

None taken. Really.

00:07:05,388 --> 00:07:06,989
Sorry to interrupt.
Don't worry about it.

He's just working on
his mommy issues.

00:07:09,158 --> 00:07:11,294
Oh, I really don't want
to know about that--
HODGES: My mother is visiting

00:07:11,294 --> 00:07:13,296
CSI for the first time
before she gets on a plane,

00:07:13,296 --> 00:07:15,031
with her boyfriend,
to go to Italy.

00:07:15,031 --> 00:07:17,233
And it's possible,
well, probable,

00:07:17,233 --> 00:07:19,735
that I may have mentioned
I was dating someone.

00:07:19,735 --> 00:07:21,037
Someone at work.

00:07:21,037 --> 00:07:23,339
HODGES: She's a woman
of expectations.

00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:25,808
The highest of which she
reserves for her son.

00:07:25,808 --> 00:07:27,009
I'm all she has.

00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:28,210
I don't want to
disappoint her.

00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:29,812
WEBSTER: Then tell her
the truth.

00:07:29,812 --> 00:07:31,847
HODGES:How would that
not disappoint her?

00:07:31,847 --> 00:07:34,150
Mandy, I am desperate.
One date,

00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:35,985
and then she's
out of your life.

00:07:48,331 --> 00:07:50,199
Ah, yes.
My favorite part.

00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:51,467
D.B.

00:07:54,337 --> 00:07:58,107
Well, the apparent C.O.D.
is traumatic brain injury,

00:07:58,107 --> 00:08:01,077
caused by projectile
penetration of the skull.

00:08:01,077 --> 00:08:02,878
Bullet to the brain.

00:08:02,878 --> 00:08:06,949
But the X-ray doesn't show
what looks like a bullet.

00:08:06,949 --> 00:08:08,918
What did it show?

00:08:08,918 --> 00:08:11,087
I'd rather not say till
I get a closer look,

00:08:11,087 --> 00:08:15,224
at the risk of sounding mad
as a hatter myself.

00:08:15,224 --> 00:08:18,828
It certainly doesn't
look like a nine mil.

00:08:18,828 --> 00:08:21,964
No, it is, in fact,
a button.

00:08:21,964 --> 00:08:25,134
How the heck did
it get in there?

00:08:25,134 --> 00:08:28,404
Well, it's roughly the
same size as our entry wound.

00:08:28,404 --> 00:08:31,240
Penetrating trauma
to the skull and gray matter

00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,109
is consistent with
a gunshot wound.

00:08:36,078 --> 00:08:39,915
Our victim had a button
fired into his head

00:08:39,915 --> 00:08:42,485
at 400 meters per second.

00:08:42,485 --> 00:08:47,056
Pretty absurd, but that's
the tale his body is telling.

00:08:47,056 --> 00:08:49,091
Curiouser and curiouser.

00:09:29,165 --> 00:09:31,834
WEBSTER: I ran every bullet,
bouquet and tea cup

00:09:31,834 --> 00:09:33,302
that Morgan brought me.

00:09:33,302 --> 00:09:35,004
Prints at the scene
matched a guest.

00:09:35,004 --> 00:09:37,106
There's no outliers.
But there was one discrepancy.

00:09:37,106 --> 00:09:38,507
I ran everything
through AFIS

00:09:38,507 --> 00:09:40,943
and there was one set that
matched to an Alan Widcom.

00:09:40,943 --> 00:09:42,144
What's the discrepancy?

00:09:42,144 --> 00:09:43,813
Well, the name
he gave you when

00:09:43,813 --> 00:09:45,781
you interviewed him
was Charles Dodson,

00:09:45,781 --> 00:09:48,284
who doesn't
actually exist.
Huh.

00:09:48,284 --> 00:09:51,787
And Alan Widcom
is an ex-convict.

00:09:51,787 --> 00:09:54,490
Good find, Mandy.

00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:55,925
WEBSTER:
Does he look familiar?

00:09:55,925 --> 00:09:57,493
Maybe.

00:09:57,493 --> 00:09:59,228
Can I borrow your marker?

00:09:59,228 --> 00:10:01,230
Thanks.

00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,442
SIDLE: Last time we spoke,
you were a caterpillar.

00:10:13,442 --> 00:10:14,910
ECKLIE: Looks like you
came out of

00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,245
your cocoon a little
more colorful.

00:10:16,245 --> 00:10:18,514
Another day, another avatar.

00:10:19,782 --> 00:10:21,750
Elvis is a big
cliche these days.

00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,185
And Liberace's
all the rage, so...

00:10:23,185 --> 00:10:26,956
Is, uh, Charles Dodson
another avatar?

00:10:26,956 --> 00:10:29,225
SIDLE:
Birth name of Lewis Carroll.

00:10:29,225 --> 00:10:31,527
Were we supposed
to think that was clever?

00:10:31,527 --> 00:10:34,096
Well, maybe a little.

00:10:34,096 --> 00:10:37,199
We dug up your
real file, Mr. Widcom.

00:10:37,199 --> 00:10:39,735
Prison records,
rap sheet,

00:10:39,735 --> 00:10:42,171
ending with a count
of armed robbery.

00:10:42,171 --> 00:10:45,174
I waved a wrench in the face

00:10:45,174 --> 00:10:47,276
of a crooked mechanic
to get my car back.

00:10:47,276 --> 00:10:50,279
It was stupid, yes,
but I'm not a thief.

00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:52,414
Then why the pseudonym?

00:10:52,414 --> 00:10:54,316
Because the state
doesn't allow

00:10:54,316 --> 00:10:58,020
felons to be ordained
ministers for ten years--

00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,122
way too long
to deny my calling.

00:11:00,122 --> 00:11:02,358
Calling?
Is that what it is?

00:11:04,059 --> 00:11:05,861
Are you married?

00:11:05,861 --> 00:11:08,163
I am.

00:11:08,163 --> 00:11:11,367
It's... special.

00:11:11,367 --> 00:11:12,835
Isn't it?

00:11:12,835 --> 00:11:15,371
Yes, it is.

00:11:19,942 --> 00:11:21,377
You want to keep your license?

00:11:21,377 --> 00:11:22,811
More than anything.

00:11:22,811 --> 00:11:24,280
Then help us get these guys.

00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,215
In prison, you've seen
your share of criminals.

00:11:26,215 --> 00:11:28,250
Anything at all
stand out with these two?

00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,451
Yes.

00:11:29,451 --> 00:11:31,487
They were very efficient.

00:11:31,487 --> 00:11:34,490
They locked the right doors,
crowd control.

00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:36,458
Everything was very intentional.

00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:37,860
Very practiced.

00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,029
This wasn't their first rodeo.

00:11:40,029 --> 00:11:41,931
No, these guys were pros.

00:11:41,931 --> 00:11:44,833
♪ ♪

00:11:51,006 --> 00:11:52,775
So what was
your other one like?

00:11:52,775 --> 00:11:54,009
Your first wedding.

00:11:54,009 --> 00:11:55,210
(chuckles):
Oh.

00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:56,412
Big affair.

00:11:56,412 --> 00:11:59,815
Probably dropped
300 G's.

00:11:59,815 --> 00:12:03,118
It was beautiful, it was grand,
but it was missing something.

00:12:03,118 --> 00:12:04,320
What's that?

00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,521
Love.

00:12:05,521 --> 00:12:07,489
(sympathetically):
Oh...

00:12:07,489 --> 00:12:08,891
(car horn honking)

00:12:08,891 --> 00:12:10,826
(laughing):
Okay. Okay!

00:12:13,429 --> 00:12:15,064
Hi.
Hi.

00:12:17,866 --> 00:12:20,169
Dearly beloved,

00:12:20,169 --> 00:12:23,906
we have gathered here today
to marry Walter Gersh to...

00:12:23,906 --> 00:12:25,975
Crystal Hasselbeck.

00:12:25,975 --> 00:12:30,846
Walter, do you take Crystal
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

00:12:30,846 --> 00:12:32,915
You bet.

00:12:32,915 --> 00:12:34,316
(laughs)

00:12:34,316 --> 00:12:36,018
To have and to... holy...

00:12:36,018 --> 00:12:37,286
(guns cocking)
Babe, what is it?

00:12:37,286 --> 00:12:38,887
Hands up in the air.

00:12:38,887 --> 00:12:40,990
Now!

00:12:46,228 --> 00:12:48,998
RUSSELL: The advice from
our caterpillar was spot-on.

00:12:48,998 --> 00:12:50,232
These guys are pros.

00:12:50,232 --> 00:12:51,433
Look at that.

00:12:51,433 --> 00:12:53,769
Took the couple
down quickly,

00:12:53,769 --> 00:12:56,071
got all their stuff
in no time.

00:12:56,071 --> 00:12:57,873
Got the car, too.

00:12:57,873 --> 00:13:02,177
Beelined it right across the
street to that service alley.

00:13:02,177 --> 00:13:03,479
Lucky move.

00:13:03,479 --> 00:13:05,214
Any longer
or in any other direction,

00:13:05,214 --> 00:13:06,815
we would've gotten them.

00:13:06,815 --> 00:13:08,384
Please tell me you got
something on the SUV.

00:13:08,384 --> 00:13:09,952
It was stolen

00:13:09,952 --> 00:13:12,254
about an hour earlier
from a mall parking lot.

00:13:12,254 --> 00:13:15,891
It's official.

00:13:15,891 --> 00:13:18,761
These two are starting
to piss me off.

00:13:18,761 --> 00:13:20,462
I feel so violated.

00:13:20,462 --> 00:13:24,066
My purse, my necklace,
my engagement ring.

00:13:24,066 --> 00:13:25,300
Anything else?

00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,236
His wallet and watch.

00:13:27,236 --> 00:13:29,004
Uh, don't forget the car.

00:13:29,004 --> 00:13:31,040
Well, yeah,
but it's just a car.

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,075
It's a Rolls Royce Corniche.

00:13:33,075 --> 00:13:34,510
It was custom;
it had everything.

00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:36,412
Well, great.
So, uh, you had LoJack?

00:13:36,412 --> 00:13:37,946
Of course not.

00:13:37,946 --> 00:13:41,283
Think I want the government
tracking me?

00:13:41,283 --> 00:13:44,386
Uh, did you see any faces?

00:13:44,386 --> 00:13:46,822
Scars? Tattoos?

00:13:46,822 --> 00:13:48,023
Hear any voices?

00:13:48,023 --> 00:13:49,958
The one on my side talked.

00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:52,127
Uh, he had a deep voice,
but it was muffled.

00:13:52,127 --> 00:13:53,495
Okay.

00:13:53,495 --> 00:13:57,232
Um, the ring...
approximate value?

00:13:57,232 --> 00:14:00,869
You can't put a price on love.

00:14:00,869 --> 00:14:03,005
A little over half a million.

00:14:03,005 --> 00:14:04,840
That's a lot of love.

00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,409
Only the best.

00:14:07,409 --> 00:14:09,111
Anything else lost or damaged?

00:14:09,111 --> 00:14:10,312
They tore his jacket.

00:14:10,312 --> 00:14:13,248
Oh.

00:14:13,248 --> 00:14:15,250
And stained my dress.

00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,119
Which is an original.

00:14:17,119 --> 00:14:20,255
I know it's not technically
your wedding night,

00:14:20,255 --> 00:14:22,458
but, uh...

00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:24,893
I'm going to need you
to take off your clothes.

00:14:29,798 --> 00:14:32,334
OLIVIA: Gotta love a
man in uniform.

00:14:35,337 --> 00:14:36,739
Look at you.

00:14:37,773 --> 00:14:39,141
Like a real doctor.

00:14:39,141 --> 00:14:41,043
Mother.

00:14:41,043 --> 00:14:42,878
You're here, now.

00:14:42,878 --> 00:14:45,414
Well, I told you I was
coming eventually.

00:14:45,414 --> 00:14:47,950
Besides, I am

00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:49,485
dying to meet her.

00:14:49,485 --> 00:14:51,453
Actually, they're
very particular about

00:14:51,453 --> 00:14:53,322
who they allow access
to in the lab.

00:14:53,322 --> 00:14:54,757
She's all taken care of.

00:14:54,757 --> 00:14:56,225
I got her
a full-access badge.

00:14:56,225 --> 00:14:58,794
Thank you, Mandy.

00:14:58,794 --> 00:15:03,298
I am just so happy
that you found someone, David.

00:15:03,298 --> 00:15:05,167
Um, funny story.

00:15:05,167 --> 00:15:06,401
Hilarious, really.

00:15:06,401 --> 00:15:08,137
I was beginning to worry

00:15:08,137 --> 00:15:10,873
that I had held onto you too
tight after your father left

00:15:10,873 --> 00:15:15,511
and didn't give you enough space
to become your own man.

00:15:15,511 --> 00:15:17,045
I'm my own man.

00:15:17,045 --> 00:15:18,814
Look. Lab coat.

00:15:18,814 --> 00:15:20,415
My own office.

00:15:20,415 --> 00:15:24,219
I expected it to be a little
bigger, given how important

00:15:24,219 --> 00:15:25,954
you are around here.

00:15:25,954 --> 00:15:29,324
Mother, I-I think
we need to talk.

00:15:29,324 --> 00:15:30,793
Hi, sweetie.

00:15:30,793 --> 00:15:32,427
Hey, you.

00:15:32,427 --> 00:15:33,862
BRODY:
You must be Mrs. Hodges.

00:15:33,862 --> 00:15:35,330
I'm Morgan Brody.

00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:37,232
I'm so excited
to finally meet you.

00:15:37,232 --> 00:15:39,334
Oh! Well, call me Olivia.

00:15:39,334 --> 00:15:41,470
(mouthing)

00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:43,305
Crazy day at the office, Olivia.

00:15:43,305 --> 00:15:45,274
(Hodges chuckles anxiously)

00:15:45,274 --> 00:15:46,475
I just came by to see

00:15:46,475 --> 00:15:48,210
if you got trace on the dress.

00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:51,246
Yes. Uh, I was able
to isolate sodium bicarbonate,

00:15:51,246 --> 00:15:53,382
citric acid, everlace enzyme

00:15:53,382 --> 00:15:55,250
and potassium monoperchlorate.

00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,119
You put them all together
and that gives you...

00:15:57,119 --> 00:15:58,353
Denture cleaner.

00:15:58,353 --> 00:15:59,888
You finish
each other's sentences.

00:15:59,888 --> 00:16:01,089
That's adorable.

00:16:01,089 --> 00:16:03,792
Why denture cleaner?

00:16:03,792 --> 00:16:06,995
Hazards of dating
a septuagenarian?

00:16:06,995 --> 00:16:08,931
Mm. Right.

00:16:10,098 --> 00:16:12,334
I wish I had more time to chat.

00:16:12,334 --> 00:16:13,769
I just, I gotta go.

00:16:13,769 --> 00:16:14,970
Have a great trip.

00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:16,171
Thank you.

00:16:16,171 --> 00:16:18,173
Bye... David.

00:16:18,173 --> 00:16:21,276
Bye.

00:16:21,276 --> 00:16:23,011
Bye.

00:16:23,011 --> 00:16:25,214
Bye. Bye.

00:16:25,214 --> 00:16:26,415
Love her.

00:16:26,415 --> 00:16:27,816
Uh, me, too.

00:16:27,816 --> 00:16:29,218
C-Clearly.

00:16:35,424 --> 00:16:36,825
Hey.

00:16:36,825 --> 00:16:38,026
Hey. Good.
Come here.

00:16:38,026 --> 00:16:39,294
I think I finally
figured out

00:16:39,294 --> 00:16:41,263
the mystery of the
button in the brain.

00:16:41,263 --> 00:16:42,431
Great.

00:16:42,431 --> 00:16:43,932
The gun bruise on

00:16:43,932 --> 00:16:45,133
our Alice's leg
Yeah?

00:16:45,133 --> 00:16:46,768
matches to this...

00:16:46,768 --> 00:16:50,272
this World War II gun,
which corresponds to casings

00:16:50,272 --> 00:16:52,241
that Morgan found at the scene.

00:16:52,241 --> 00:16:53,442
Right? Like this one right here.

00:16:53,442 --> 00:16:54,877
Nine-mil.

00:16:54,877 --> 00:16:57,179
She also found an
overpowder wad,

00:16:57,179 --> 00:17:00,816
that fit in here like this.

00:17:00,816 --> 00:17:02,451
Keep the powder in, because...

00:17:02,451 --> 00:17:03,986
They were using blanks.

00:17:03,986 --> 00:17:05,187
No projectile,

00:17:05,187 --> 00:17:07,489
but you get the same
amount of force

00:17:07,489 --> 00:17:11,360
as your everyday 400-
meter-per-second bullet.

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,196
Now, that force
usually comes out

00:17:14,196 --> 00:17:16,865
in the form of a loud
but harmless

00:17:16,865 --> 00:17:18,267
muzzle flash.

00:17:18,267 --> 00:17:21,103
Unless the barrel
is obstructed...

00:17:21,103 --> 00:17:22,437
FINLAY:
By a button.

00:17:22,437 --> 00:17:23,839
Fire in the hole!

00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,240
(gunshot)

00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,782
Projectile by proxy.

00:17:33,782 --> 00:17:35,384
FINLAY:
Okay, so we have the "how,"

00:17:35,384 --> 00:17:37,519
now we need the "who."

00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:40,188
Same rifle showed up
in the drive-thru video.

00:17:40,188 --> 00:17:42,291
So we've connected the gun
to both scenes, right?

00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:43,992
Mm-hmm.
So it's safe to assume

00:17:43,992 --> 00:17:45,360
that it's the same twosome.

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,129
Yeah.
Same M.O., generally.

00:17:47,129 --> 00:17:48,330
Armed,

00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:50,432
disguised, wedding hits.

00:17:50,432 --> 00:17:52,467
But the two targets
couldn't be more different.

00:17:52,467 --> 00:17:55,370
Wonderland was, like,
this grand scheme, right?

00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:56,972
Carefully planned.

00:17:56,972 --> 00:17:58,340
Drive-thru was smaller.

00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,008
More spur of the moment.

00:18:00,008 --> 00:18:01,743
So, think.

00:18:01,743 --> 00:18:03,145
What's the common denominator?

00:18:03,145 --> 00:18:05,180
The ring.

00:18:09,084 --> 00:18:10,285
Hi.

00:18:10,285 --> 00:18:11,853
Do you have an appointment?

00:18:11,853 --> 00:18:13,055
We're on the list.

00:18:13,055 --> 00:18:14,790
Thank you.

00:18:17,893 --> 00:18:20,128
Are you two together?

00:18:20,128 --> 00:18:21,330
Yes, we are.

00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:22,731
We're from the crime lab.

00:18:22,731 --> 00:18:24,833
Do you recognize
these two people?

00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:26,168
Insurance tells us

00:18:26,168 --> 00:18:28,804
that they were here
buying a ring a while back.

00:18:28,804 --> 00:18:30,005
Yes, of course.

00:18:30,005 --> 00:18:31,206
Hard to forget.

00:18:31,206 --> 00:18:32,407
Because of the
age difference?

00:18:32,407 --> 00:18:33,809
Age difference?

00:18:33,809 --> 00:18:35,010
This is Las Vegas.

00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:36,411
I'm talking about the ring.

00:18:36,411 --> 00:18:38,313
For starters,
it's a Gartreau.

00:18:39,348 --> 00:18:41,216
Gordon Gartreau.

00:18:41,216 --> 00:18:44,052
Designs ten rings a year,
using the finest gold.

00:18:44,052 --> 00:18:45,754
Non-conflict diamonds.

00:18:45,754 --> 00:18:47,356
Well, this diamond
found a conflict.

00:18:47,356 --> 00:18:48,757
Armed robbery,

00:18:48,757 --> 00:18:50,225
last night.

00:18:50,225 --> 00:18:51,827
So if we stole a ring like that,

00:18:51,827 --> 00:18:53,161
how would we go about
reselling it?

00:18:53,161 --> 00:18:54,363
You wouldn't.

00:18:54,363 --> 00:18:55,731
It's one of a kind.

00:18:55,731 --> 00:18:56,932
Distinct.

00:18:56,932 --> 00:18:58,166
Well, that would be
kind of hard

00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:00,068
for your average thief
to fence it

00:19:00,068 --> 00:19:01,937
and make any kind of profit.

00:19:01,937 --> 00:19:04,272
Too high-profile
to sell at auction.

00:19:04,272 --> 00:19:06,141
So what are we looking at here?

00:19:06,141 --> 00:19:07,743
Thank you, thank you.

00:19:07,743 --> 00:19:09,177
Sorry we wasted your time.

00:19:09,177 --> 00:19:10,979
Uh, just one more thing.

00:19:10,979 --> 00:19:15,017
The woman that bought that ring,
she's been here before.

00:19:16,218 --> 00:19:18,120
A few times.

00:19:26,028 --> 00:19:28,463
SANDERS:
Do you recognize any of these?

00:19:28,463 --> 00:19:31,466
Yes.

00:19:31,466 --> 00:19:34,503
I think these rings were all
mine, at one time or another.

00:19:34,503 --> 00:19:37,272
And at this time,
where are they?

00:19:37,272 --> 00:19:41,043
This one I sold.

00:19:41,043 --> 00:19:43,311
This one I lost.

00:19:43,311 --> 00:19:45,781
And you know
this one was stolen.

00:19:45,781 --> 00:19:47,149
You insured it.

00:19:47,149 --> 00:19:48,350
Immediately
after buying it.

00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:49,751
Is that right?

00:19:49,751 --> 00:19:51,386
That's when
you get things insured.

00:19:51,386 --> 00:19:53,422
Is getting engaged
a crime now?

00:19:53,422 --> 00:19:54,990
No.

00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:57,125
But fraud is.

00:19:57,125 --> 00:20:01,296
You declared its value
at $1.1 million.

00:20:01,296 --> 00:20:04,966
That's twice what your
fiancé told me it was worth.

00:20:04,966 --> 00:20:06,435
And this one
that you lost,

00:20:06,435 --> 00:20:08,503
sold online to
some guy in Jersey.

00:20:08,503 --> 00:20:11,306
His receiving account
points to you.

00:20:14,109 --> 00:20:17,012
The first time
was a bad breakup,

00:20:17,012 --> 00:20:18,280
so I kept the ring.

00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,949
The second time was easier.

00:20:20,949 --> 00:20:22,751
More of a business transaction.

00:20:24,152 --> 00:20:26,288
Times are tough.

00:20:26,288 --> 00:20:27,789
And love...

00:20:27,789 --> 00:20:29,925
Is what,
recession-proof?

00:20:31,126 --> 00:20:33,095
Did you set up this robbery?

00:20:33,095 --> 00:20:34,496
No, I didn't.

00:20:34,496 --> 00:20:35,864
I swear.

00:20:35,864 --> 00:20:37,833
I would never
put Walt in danger.

00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,267
But you had no problem
setting him up

00:20:39,267 --> 00:20:40,735
to buy you an expensive ring.

00:20:41,736 --> 00:20:47,042
At first... yeah.

00:20:47,042 --> 00:20:52,481
But then, when we were
pulling up, I realized,

00:20:52,481 --> 00:20:57,352
well, I really wanted
to marry him.

00:20:57,352 --> 00:20:59,354
Be married to him.

00:20:59,354 --> 00:21:02,124
Why should I believe you?

00:21:02,124 --> 00:21:05,127
I don't know.

00:21:05,127 --> 00:21:07,863
But you have to believe
in love, right?

00:21:10,232 --> 00:21:13,235
You are the greatest.

00:21:13,235 --> 00:21:15,303
Glad I could help.

00:21:15,303 --> 00:21:16,771
Mom off to Italy?

00:21:16,771 --> 00:21:18,340
Well, uh, good
news and bad news.

00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,242
Her boyfriend's
flight was delayed.

00:21:20,242 --> 00:21:21,910
Oh, hope that's the bad news.

00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:23,278
Yeah, and since
she's available,

00:21:23,278 --> 00:21:26,781
she wanted to have
brunch with me and you.

00:21:26,781 --> 00:21:28,917
Oh. That is bad news.

00:21:28,917 --> 00:21:30,952
Oh, that's not
the bad news.

00:21:30,952 --> 00:21:33,355
She also wants your
father to join us.

00:21:35,957 --> 00:21:38,994
The last time I had a meal
with my father

00:21:38,994 --> 00:21:41,530
was 14 years ago, when he
tried to explain divorce

00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:43,165
over a milkshake.

00:21:43,165 --> 00:21:44,966
You don't expect me
to call him up for this?

00:21:44,966 --> 00:21:47,335
No, no, no, no,
y-you don't have to.

00:21:47,335 --> 00:21:49,337
Mother made me call him.

00:21:49,337 --> 00:21:51,339
And he's very excited.

00:21:51,339 --> 00:21:53,074
Albeit a little confused.

00:21:53,074 --> 00:21:55,076
Yeah, he's not the only one.

00:21:55,076 --> 00:21:56,444
You saw her face.

00:21:56,444 --> 00:21:58,780
The way that she lit
up when she saw you.

00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,282
Sh-She was happy.

00:22:02,284 --> 00:22:03,952
Proud.

00:22:03,952 --> 00:22:05,253
Please?

00:22:05,253 --> 00:22:07,255
I'll do anything you ask.

00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:10,959
All my cases.

00:22:10,959 --> 00:22:12,827
Front of the trace line.

00:22:12,827 --> 00:22:14,462
For a year.

00:22:14,462 --> 00:22:16,097
You're the greatest.

00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,509
Ooh. Sweet ride.

00:22:27,509 --> 00:22:28,910
The sweetest.

00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:30,111
Custom everything.

00:22:30,111 --> 00:22:31,947
Where'd they find it?

00:22:31,947 --> 00:22:33,315
D Street and Hudgins.

00:22:33,315 --> 00:22:35,517
Sticking out like a sore thumb,
pre-pillaged.

00:22:38,386 --> 00:22:40,455
Got something here.

00:22:44,025 --> 00:22:45,527
Fabric.

00:22:48,997 --> 00:22:50,365
It's polyester.

00:22:52,467 --> 00:22:53,935
And they didn't take

00:22:53,935 --> 00:22:55,437
the high-end sound system.

00:22:55,437 --> 00:22:57,339
That's worth what,
a couple grand on the street?

00:22:57,339 --> 00:22:58,873
Easy.

00:22:58,873 --> 00:23:00,342
So what did they take?

00:23:00,342 --> 00:23:03,044
I noticed the hood ornament.

00:23:03,044 --> 00:23:07,215
And the... whatever
these emblem things were.

00:23:07,215 --> 00:23:09,351
They're on
the steering wheel, too.

00:23:11,186 --> 00:23:13,188
And the glove
compartment.

00:23:13,188 --> 00:23:15,991
Why these
and not the radio?

00:23:15,991 --> 00:23:18,360
I think...

00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,395
that they were gold.

00:23:20,395 --> 00:23:21,796
I got filings.

00:23:21,796 --> 00:23:23,098
I bet they wanted to make sure

00:23:23,098 --> 00:23:26,334
<i>that they were solid</i>
<i>and not plated.</i>

00:23:26,334 --> 00:23:28,003
Yeah, but wouldn't filing them

00:23:28,003 --> 00:23:30,171
make them less valuable
and harder to sell?

00:23:30,171 --> 00:23:32,173
Russell said the ring
was one of a kind.

00:23:32,173 --> 00:23:33,942
That's hard to sell, too.

00:23:33,942 --> 00:23:36,444
So maybe they're not
stealing the gold to resell it.

00:23:36,444 --> 00:23:38,813
Maybe they're melting it down.

00:23:38,813 --> 00:23:42,150
So where do you go
to melt stolen gold in Vegas?

00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:44,919
ECKLIE: <i>Had all my detectives</i>
<i>reach out to informants</i>

00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:46,521
in the stolen
jewelry trade.

00:23:46,521 --> 00:23:48,189
Several pointed
to a Fredrick Ladd.

00:23:48,189 --> 00:23:50,892
Runs a cash-for-gold store
in some nearby strip mall.

00:23:50,892 --> 00:23:52,093
Yeah, like the ads.

00:23:52,093 --> 00:23:54,863
"Market crash.
Cold, hard cash."

00:23:54,863 --> 00:23:56,498
Seriously,
you watch too much TV.

00:23:56,498 --> 00:23:59,034
I work the night shift, and
my husband's living abroad.

00:23:59,034 --> 00:24:00,368
Cut me some slack, please.

00:24:02,103 --> 00:24:04,039
ECKLIE:
Anyway, knocked on the door.

00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:05,407
No answer.

00:24:05,407 --> 00:24:07,275
Strange burning smell.

00:24:07,275 --> 00:24:08,777
Unis found him dead.

00:24:08,777 --> 00:24:10,345
Gold poured down
his throat.

00:24:10,345 --> 00:24:11,746
Looks like
it's connected

00:24:11,746 --> 00:24:13,081
to the Wonderland Robbery.

00:24:13,081 --> 00:24:15,917
How can you be sure?
Educated guess.

00:24:28,897 --> 00:24:30,398
RUSSELL:
Hey. What do you got?

00:24:30,398 --> 00:24:32,734
Looks like our victim
was a modern-day alchemist,

00:24:32,734 --> 00:24:33,935
turning stolen jewelry

00:24:33,935 --> 00:24:35,503
into untraceable gold.

00:24:35,503 --> 00:24:38,239
Yeah, because our job
isn't hard enough, right?

00:24:38,239 --> 00:24:40,075
What's all this stuff?

00:24:40,075 --> 00:24:42,210
All that doesn't glitter--
separated before the melt.

00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:43,978
Nana of the bride
had a dragonfly brooch.

00:24:43,978 --> 00:24:45,847
It was torn
from her blazer.

00:24:45,847 --> 00:24:48,116
The brooch is here.
The gems are here.
Empty wallet

00:24:48,116 --> 00:24:51,319
belonging to the driver
of the Rolls-Royce.

00:24:51,319 --> 00:24:54,322
This is like a land
of smoking guns.

00:24:54,322 --> 00:24:56,825
It looks like the feline
was in mid-melt

00:24:56,825 --> 00:24:58,793
when somebody
turned up the heat.

00:24:58,793 --> 00:25:00,962
(grunting)

00:25:03,264 --> 00:25:06,401
(camera shutter snapping)

00:25:06,401 --> 00:25:09,003
Looks like the cast iron's
our murder weapon.

00:25:09,003 --> 00:25:10,839
What is that
on the handle?

00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:13,274
I don't know.

00:25:13,274 --> 00:25:15,877
So why kill
somebody like this?

00:25:15,877 --> 00:25:17,946
What are they doing,
sending a message?

00:25:17,946 --> 00:25:19,981
We were looking for two robbers.

00:25:19,981 --> 00:25:22,250
Maybe the partnership
hit a rough patch.

00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:24,285
Maybe.

00:25:26,521 --> 00:25:28,523
RUSSELL:
Hey, Doc.

00:25:28,523 --> 00:25:30,058
How goes it?

00:25:30,058 --> 00:25:31,926
I'll tell you this--
I'm not bored.

00:25:31,926 --> 00:25:33,361
Confirm cause of death yet?

00:25:33,361 --> 00:25:35,530
Thermal injuries.

00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:38,199
He was alive when the gold
was poured down his throat.

00:25:38,199 --> 00:25:40,068
Cooked him from the inside.

00:25:40,068 --> 00:25:43,138
RUSSELL: <i>Gold melts</i>
<i>at 1,850 degrees Fahrenheit.</i>

00:25:43,138 --> 00:25:44,973
(grunting)

00:25:44,973 --> 00:25:47,942
Soft tissue didn't
stand a chance.

00:25:53,815 --> 00:25:55,917
So what's with the XRF?

00:25:55,917 --> 00:25:57,352
I want to test
this guy's metal.

00:25:57,352 --> 00:25:58,953
If you're so into gold

00:25:58,953 --> 00:26:00,955
that you pry it off a
poor bride's finger,

00:26:00,955 --> 00:26:02,390
why would you waste it

00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:04,826
by pouring it
down your partner's gullet?

00:26:04,826 --> 00:26:06,861
I figured it
was heat of the moment.

00:26:06,861 --> 00:26:08,363
Those two seemed like
they were as cool

00:26:08,363 --> 00:26:09,898
as the center seed
of a cucumber.

00:26:09,898 --> 00:26:11,466
A little out of character,
don't you think?

00:26:11,466 --> 00:26:13,401
(beeping)

00:26:16,237 --> 00:26:17,439
Iron pyrite.

00:26:17,439 --> 00:26:18,940
Fool's gold.

00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,408
We're the only fools
around here.

00:26:20,408 --> 00:26:22,076
I mean, he's not
our Cheshire cat.

00:26:22,076 --> 00:26:24,012
Yeah, but why
would they set it up

00:26:24,012 --> 00:26:25,814
to look like
a busted partnership?

00:26:25,814 --> 00:26:27,415
Exactly. You know,
they should be halfway

00:26:27,415 --> 00:26:30,084
to China by now,
but they stop and they do this?

00:26:30,084 --> 00:26:31,886
Only one reason
I can think of

00:26:31,886 --> 00:26:33,755
to go to that much trouble.

00:26:33,755 --> 00:26:35,390
And what's that?

00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:37,926
They're planning another job.

00:26:43,798 --> 00:26:45,300
I'm sorry about this.

00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,202
I-I was really just trying
to do a favor

00:26:47,202 --> 00:26:48,403
for Hodges, and he...

00:26:48,403 --> 00:26:49,904
Is an
irrepressible,

00:26:49,904 --> 00:26:51,840
but ridiculous human being?

00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,908
Yeah, that.

00:26:53,908 --> 00:26:56,077
Sorry.

00:26:56,077 --> 00:26:58,513
No, don't be. It's a... it's a
nice thing you're doing for him.

00:26:58,513 --> 00:27:02,817
And as good an excuse as any
for us to finally catch up.

00:27:06,921 --> 00:27:10,191
You fold your napkin
just like your mom.

00:27:10,191 --> 00:27:11,860
You used
to do that when we

00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,428
went to Choozy's Chicken.
Do you remember?

00:27:17,932 --> 00:27:19,901
How's she doing? She okay?

00:27:19,901 --> 00:27:22,036
Yeah, she's doing great.

00:27:22,036 --> 00:27:24,205
Jerry, he's, uh...
he's good to her?

00:27:24,205 --> 00:27:25,440
Kind?

00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,841
Oh, yeah.

00:27:26,841 --> 00:27:28,810
She practically owns him.

00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:30,778
Well, that sounds about right.

00:27:30,778 --> 00:27:32,480
Well...

00:27:34,015 --> 00:27:36,150
I'm happy she's happy.

00:27:37,485 --> 00:27:39,287
Yeah.

00:27:39,287 --> 00:27:41,356
I know you are.

00:27:41,356 --> 00:27:42,757
(door opens and closes)

00:27:42,757 --> 00:27:43,958
Hi.

00:27:43,958 --> 00:27:45,994
Hi.
Good to see you again.

00:27:45,994 --> 00:27:47,262
Hello.

00:27:47,262 --> 00:27:49,130
Hi. That's where Morgan
gets her looks.

00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:50,765
Oh. (chuckles)

00:27:50,765 --> 00:27:51,966
Olivia Hodges.

00:27:51,966 --> 00:27:53,201
Conrad Ecklie.

00:27:53,201 --> 00:27:54,836
My pleasure.
Well...

00:27:54,836 --> 00:27:57,105
Here we are.
Yeah.

00:27:57,105 --> 00:27:58,473
This is nice.

00:27:58,473 --> 00:28:00,141
Maybe we should
order champagne?

00:28:00,141 --> 00:28:01,342
Celebrate?

00:28:01,342 --> 00:28:02,744
BRODY:
Oh?

00:28:02,744 --> 00:28:06,281
What's the occasion exactly?

00:28:06,281 --> 00:28:07,916
Young love.

00:28:07,916 --> 00:28:11,085
David is my only child.

00:28:11,085 --> 00:28:13,388
Handsome, clearly;
charming.

00:28:13,388 --> 00:28:15,323
But he's had a bit
of a dry spell.

00:28:15,323 --> 00:28:17,058
Mother!
What?

00:28:17,058 --> 00:28:19,060
It's a natural
parental concern.

00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:21,262
Back me up here,
Conrad.

00:28:21,262 --> 00:28:24,098
Well, I'd, uh...
I'd be lying if I said

00:28:24,098 --> 00:28:26,467
I didn't have fantasies
about walking Morgan

00:28:26,467 --> 00:28:28,303
down the aisle.

00:28:28,303 --> 00:28:30,104
Someday.

00:28:31,306 --> 00:28:32,840
So tell me--

00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,108
how did you two meet?

00:28:35,143 --> 00:28:36,444
Uh...

00:28:36,444 --> 00:28:37,845
You.
I'll take it.

00:28:37,845 --> 00:28:39,047
Yeah.

00:28:39,047 --> 00:28:40,815
Well, um...

00:28:40,815 --> 00:28:44,018
I was called down to L.A.
on the trail

00:28:44,018 --> 00:28:46,387
of this sinister man called
the Dick and Jane Killer,

00:28:46,387 --> 00:28:48,923
and Morgan was assisting

00:28:48,923 --> 00:28:50,491
on the case.

00:28:50,491 --> 00:28:52,393
And when the smoke cleared,

00:28:52,393 --> 00:28:56,831
the only thing left
was this pent-up...

00:28:56,831 --> 00:28:59,934
cross-jurisdictional
sexual tension...

00:28:59,934 --> 00:29:01,202
I'm going to hit
the restroom

00:29:01,202 --> 00:29:02,403
real quick.

00:29:02,403 --> 00:29:04,272
OLIVIA:
Great. I'll join you.

00:29:09,877 --> 00:29:11,446
So...

00:29:11,446 --> 00:29:12,981
David,

00:29:12,981 --> 00:29:15,149
your mom-- is, uh...

00:29:15,149 --> 00:29:16,985
is-is she...
She has a
boyfriend.

00:29:16,985 --> 00:29:18,252
He's a count.

00:29:18,252 --> 00:29:20,788
They're going to Italy together.

00:29:23,925 --> 00:29:26,060
What, are you
working out your commute?

00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,462
(chuckling)

00:29:27,462 --> 00:29:29,464
Hell, no. I gave up
on that years ago.

00:29:29,464 --> 00:29:30,999
I'm trying to
figure out

00:29:30,999 --> 00:29:32,867
how these wedding
robbers got away clean.

00:29:32,867 --> 00:29:34,068
From which robbery?

00:29:34,068 --> 00:29:35,269
From both of them.

00:29:35,269 --> 00:29:36,938
When they took off
from the drive-thru,

00:29:36,938 --> 00:29:38,139
they headed east

00:29:38,139 --> 00:29:39,474
into oncoming traffic

00:29:39,474 --> 00:29:41,275
and got away
by the skin of their teeth.

00:29:41,275 --> 00:29:44,412
Now, it seemed like dumb luck,
but if you look at the map

00:29:44,412 --> 00:29:45,847
on the left--

00:29:45,847 --> 00:29:47,515
that green square
is the chapel, okay?

00:29:47,515 --> 00:29:50,351
Gotcha. And the red square is
where we found the Rolls Royce.

00:29:50,351 --> 00:29:53,354
Yeah, yeah, and radio cars
saturated the area between,

00:29:53,354 --> 00:29:55,289
but nobody saw two people

00:29:55,289 --> 00:29:57,392
in gas masks in a high-end ride.

00:29:57,392 --> 00:29:59,527
They're not lucky;
they're good.

00:29:59,527 --> 00:30:01,529
Exactly. They pulled
the same disappearing act

00:30:01,529 --> 00:30:03,464
when they robbed
the Wonderland wedding.

00:30:03,464 --> 00:30:05,033
So the map on the right--

00:30:05,033 --> 00:30:08,002
I reverse-engineered it
from the dispatch tapes.

00:30:08,002 --> 00:30:10,071
Now, in this case,
the net was even tighter.

00:30:10,071 --> 00:30:12,173
Five radio cars
and an eye in the sky.

00:30:12,173 --> 00:30:13,441
And no one
saw the getaway car?

00:30:13,441 --> 00:30:14,976
No. No.

00:30:14,976 --> 00:30:16,744
And all the main roads
were blocked off.

00:30:16,744 --> 00:30:18,446
You know,
I think maybe our bad guys

00:30:18,446 --> 00:30:20,314
know some shortcuts.

00:30:20,314 --> 00:30:23,418
We could look at cab drivers,
high-end liveries, limousines.

00:30:23,418 --> 00:30:24,819
Yeah.

00:30:24,819 --> 00:30:26,220
That's a good idea.

00:30:33,961 --> 00:30:35,196
You're still here?

00:30:35,196 --> 00:30:36,464
Yeah.

00:30:36,464 --> 00:30:37,865
You know,
you should really

00:30:37,865 --> 00:30:39,200
go home
and get some rest.

00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,003
I can't stop thinking
of my wife.

00:30:42,003 --> 00:30:44,105
Supposed to be
the best day of your life,

00:30:44,105 --> 00:30:46,974
and-and your soul mate is killed
right in front of you.

00:30:46,974 --> 00:30:48,342
You imagine that?
No.

00:30:48,342 --> 00:30:50,511
I never got a chance
to marry my soul mate.

00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,915
Come here. Come here.

00:30:53,915 --> 00:30:55,116
Let me...

00:30:55,116 --> 00:30:56,451
Let me just show you
something here.

00:30:56,451 --> 00:30:58,119
Uh, Liberace Caterpillar guy,

00:30:58,119 --> 00:30:59,821
right, he said that...

00:30:59,821 --> 00:31:01,255
that those two were practiced?

00:31:01,255 --> 00:31:03,124
Well, I think
I finally figured out

00:31:03,124 --> 00:31:04,459
where they got their practice.

00:31:04,459 --> 00:31:05,993
New York City.

00:31:05,993 --> 00:31:08,262
Three years ago, three
wedding robberies.

00:31:08,262 --> 00:31:10,098
And then I couldn't
find any more.

00:31:10,098 --> 00:31:12,200
Until...
Chicago,
last year.

00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,868
Yeah.
Three wedding robberies.

00:31:13,868 --> 00:31:15,369
Bing, bang, boom.
Okay, look at this.

00:31:15,369 --> 00:31:18,139
It's not just three in a row.

00:31:18,139 --> 00:31:21,409
It's three robberies
on three consecutive days.

00:31:21,409 --> 00:31:24,512
New York--
Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

00:31:24,512 --> 00:31:26,781
Chicago--
Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

00:31:26,781 --> 00:31:28,015
Las Vegas.

00:31:28,015 --> 00:31:29,317
Friday was
Wonderland.

00:31:29,317 --> 00:31:32,120
Saturday...
The drive-through.

00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,422
Right, so today, Sunday.

00:31:34,422 --> 00:31:37,058
So that means their hit
has to be today.

00:31:37,058 --> 00:31:39,360
There are hundreds of weddings
going on today.

00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,195
We got to
narrow it down.

00:31:41,195 --> 00:31:43,297
We have reason to believe
that these wedding robbers

00:31:43,297 --> 00:31:45,433
are due for one more hit
by day's end.

00:31:45,433 --> 00:31:47,135
Okay, we got
three teams.

00:31:47,135 --> 00:31:48,736
Team A, with Finn,

00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:50,438
going to the chapel on
top of the Palermo.

00:31:50,438 --> 00:31:53,107
I'm with Sanders,
hitting the black-tie affair

00:31:53,107 --> 00:31:54,976
at the Mediterranean
with Team Bravo.

00:31:54,976 --> 00:31:57,945
Sara and I are headed
to Temple Beth El.

00:31:57,945 --> 00:31:59,847
All right,
we got one more chance

00:31:59,847 --> 00:32:02,150
to get these guys,
then they disappear.

00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:03,918
Good luck, everybody.

00:32:15,329 --> 00:32:17,298
Hey.
Hey.

00:32:17,298 --> 00:32:19,367
Hodges around?

00:32:19,367 --> 00:32:21,068
Oh, his mom dragged
him out of the lab.

00:32:21,068 --> 00:32:22,770
Ah.

00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:24,438
Uh, do you know if he
got trace on the cast iron?

00:32:24,438 --> 00:32:25,840
He did.

00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,074
That latex there

00:32:27,074 --> 00:32:29,110
was next to the
seared flesh here.

00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:30,511
Which got me thinking--

00:32:30,511 --> 00:32:32,847
latex could be a glove,

00:32:32,847 --> 00:32:36,384
and maybe the charred skin
is a finger.

00:32:36,384 --> 00:32:38,119
Can you get a print off that?

00:32:38,119 --> 00:32:40,254
Well, I better
at least get a partial.

00:32:43,157 --> 00:32:44,792
(camera shutter snapping)

00:32:44,792 --> 00:32:47,461
Or a partial of a partial.

00:32:47,461 --> 00:32:49,463
Minimal ridge detail.

00:32:49,463 --> 00:32:53,167
And it matches about...
almost 4,000 prints on AFIS.

00:32:53,167 --> 00:32:55,102
Latex glove.

00:32:55,102 --> 00:32:57,071
Polyester
from the car,

00:32:57,071 --> 00:32:58,940
Maybe a uniform.

00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:01,175
Is there a database
for ambulance drivers?

00:33:01,175 --> 00:33:04,212
Yeah, there's a National
Paramedics Registry.

00:33:04,212 --> 00:33:06,247
BRODY: Nick said something
about how the robbers

00:33:06,247 --> 00:33:07,949
really knew all of the roads.

00:33:09,817 --> 00:33:11,853
Pay dirt. Kyle Hartley,
paramedic EMT.

00:33:11,853 --> 00:33:13,054
I know him.

00:33:13,054 --> 00:33:15,223
He was at the first
crime scene.

00:33:15,223 --> 00:33:17,024
That's how they got away
so clean.

00:33:17,024 --> 00:33:18,993
No one notices an ambulance.
And they certainly

00:33:18,993 --> 00:33:20,328
don't blink
when you run a red light.

00:33:20,328 --> 00:33:21,863
They just get out of the way
for you.

00:33:21,863 --> 00:33:23,030
He moved here
eight months ago

00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:24,232
from Chicago.

00:33:24,232 --> 00:33:25,733
He has no
criminal record.

00:33:25,733 --> 00:33:26,968
He's married.

00:33:26,968 --> 00:33:30,204
And look who he's married to.

00:33:30,204 --> 00:33:31,405
(door opens)

00:33:31,405 --> 00:33:32,807
OLIVIA:
Come on.

00:33:32,807 --> 00:33:34,208
We're just looking.

00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:37,011
Mother, I feel
that this is a bit
presumptuous.

00:33:37,011 --> 00:33:39,113
You don't let a keeper
like Morgan get away.

00:33:39,113 --> 00:33:42,183
Now, your co-worker Mandy
said that this was the place.

00:33:42,183 --> 00:33:43,818
Hello. Can I help you?

00:33:43,818 --> 00:33:46,354
Yes. My son, a big deal

00:33:46,354 --> 00:33:48,122
over at the Las Vegas Police
Crime Lab,

00:33:48,122 --> 00:33:50,224
would like
to purchase a ring.

00:33:51,792 --> 00:33:54,495
Huh, look at that.
Denture cleaner.

00:33:54,495 --> 00:33:56,430
We use it to de-oxydize
the metals.

00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:58,399
Gives it a real shine.

00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:00,902
That's funny. I was just...

00:34:03,104 --> 00:34:05,473
You were just what?

00:34:05,473 --> 00:34:09,010
I was just... nothing.
Mother, come on.

00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:10,344
We're leaving.

00:34:10,344 --> 00:34:12,280
(guns cock)

00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,015
Yeah, I don't think you are.

00:34:14,015 --> 00:34:16,884
(muffled groaning)

00:34:16,884 --> 00:34:18,352
David, what's happening?

00:34:18,352 --> 00:34:21,055
I believe we've just found
our wedding thieves.

00:34:21,055 --> 00:34:24,458
But don't worry,
Mother.
Okay.

00:34:24,458 --> 00:34:26,961
I know for a fact
they only shoot blanks.

00:34:30,331 --> 00:34:31,732
Oh!

00:34:31,732 --> 00:34:32,967
Not anymore.

00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,982
OFFICER 1: Clear?
OFFICER 2: All clear.

00:34:47,982 --> 00:34:49,850
You okay?

00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:51,085
Do I look okay?

00:34:51,085 --> 00:34:53,054
Someone call the paramedics.

00:34:53,054 --> 00:34:55,389
Gunshot wound.
They blindsided me,
Emily and her husband.

00:34:55,389 --> 00:34:56,791
How long ago
did they leave?

00:34:56,791 --> 00:34:58,259
Four or five minutes ago.

00:34:58,259 --> 00:35:00,294
They had me disable the
surveillance and the alarm,

00:35:00,294 --> 00:35:02,063
and they cleaned
the place out and took off.

00:35:02,063 --> 00:35:03,864
Listen to me-- one of
our guys was headed here.

00:35:03,864 --> 00:35:05,066
Did you see him?

00:35:05,066 --> 00:35:06,300
Crime lab guy and his mom?

00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,768
Yeah... yeah,
they had them

00:35:07,768 --> 00:35:08,970
toss their phones
over there,

00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:10,171
and they took 'em with 'em.

00:35:10,171 --> 00:35:11,439
Do you know where
they were going?

00:35:11,439 --> 00:35:13,040
They just said "Out of town."

00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,177
Control 101, we've got
a 444 originating

00:35:16,177 --> 00:35:18,012
<i>at Van Der Meer Jewelry.</i>

00:35:18,012 --> 00:35:20,915
DISPATCHER:
This is Code Red channel--
444 in progress.

00:35:20,915 --> 00:35:24,118
Suspects may be driving
a white EMT vehicle.

00:35:24,118 --> 00:35:26,354
Point of origin Granholm
and Wells Avenue.

00:35:26,354 --> 00:35:28,856
Babe, they know
where we started.

00:35:28,856 --> 00:35:31,392
They always do.
We're always fine.

00:35:31,392 --> 00:35:33,127
Did you take
the number off the roof?

00:35:33,127 --> 00:35:35,162
Did one better.
Switched it for another rig.

00:35:35,162 --> 00:35:36,831
They're scrambled,
but looking for him.

00:35:36,831 --> 00:35:38,766
And they're giving us
the heads up.

00:35:38,766 --> 00:35:40,468
OFFICER (over radio):
2-Charlie-34,
proceeding eastbound

00:35:40,468 --> 00:35:41,869
on Sahara towards Kings Road.

00:35:41,869 --> 00:35:43,137
The radio.

00:35:43,137 --> 00:35:44,805
That's how you always
knew where to be.

00:35:44,805 --> 00:35:46,073
And where not to be.

00:35:46,073 --> 00:35:48,776
Plus, getting away is
always easier

00:35:48,776 --> 00:35:50,111
when you can
change traffic lights.

00:35:50,111 --> 00:35:51,912
What are you gonna
do with us?

00:35:51,912 --> 00:35:53,781
We're driving to the desert
where we have a car.

00:35:53,781 --> 00:35:54,982
We're leaving you there.

00:35:54,982 --> 00:35:56,917
Next stop, Fiji.

00:35:56,917 --> 00:35:59,286
How on earth are we gonna get
back from the desert?

00:35:59,286 --> 00:36:02,156
We're not, Mom.

00:36:02,156 --> 00:36:05,226
OFFICER: Patrol, 2-Charlie-7,
west from Lonnie Avenue.

00:36:05,226 --> 00:36:06,427
No sign of anything yet.

00:36:06,427 --> 00:36:09,864
Copy that,
2-Charlie-7.

00:36:09,864 --> 00:36:11,265
Don't worry. We'll get 'em.

00:36:11,265 --> 00:36:13,034
Your dad scrambled
the entire department.

00:36:13,034 --> 00:36:14,869
Good guys are everywhere.

00:36:14,869 --> 00:36:16,170
Yeah, they were there before.

00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:18,039
Yeah, but listen to 'em, uh...

00:36:18,039 --> 00:36:20,374
on a red channel,
open to everyone.

00:36:20,374 --> 00:36:21,909
They're all talking
back and forth.

00:36:21,909 --> 00:36:23,210
Air Three, Control.
Are you up?

00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:24,912
Control, Air Three.
Beginning sweep...

00:36:24,912 --> 00:36:26,747
BRODY: They're talking
to each other.

00:36:26,747 --> 00:36:30,518
And if we can hear them...
so can an ambulance.

00:36:30,518 --> 00:36:34,155
(over radio):
Copy all. This is Charlie-12,
465 and I-15 southbound exit.

00:36:34,155 --> 00:36:36,457
Hey.

00:36:36,457 --> 00:36:38,526
I need your help.

00:36:38,526 --> 00:36:41,228
(over radio):
2-Charlie-2, we have a visual
on possible vehicle.

00:36:41,228 --> 00:36:42,863
We need backup
to Tropicana Way.

00:36:42,863 --> 00:36:44,832
They're heading to the
other side of town.

00:36:44,832 --> 00:36:46,333
We should be good.

00:36:46,333 --> 00:36:48,169
(over radio): ...proceed to
northwest corner of...

00:36:48,169 --> 00:36:50,371
Please,
do something.

00:36:50,371 --> 00:36:52,106
Like what?

00:36:52,106 --> 00:36:53,974
I don't know.
You're this big police person.

00:36:53,974 --> 00:36:57,011
I'm a criminalist.
Lab rat, Mom. That's it.

00:36:57,011 --> 00:36:59,747
You know what
I do all day?

00:36:59,747 --> 00:37:02,483
I measure and analyze
tiny bits of tiny.

00:37:02,483 --> 00:37:04,985
Is it exciting?
Not always.

00:37:04,985 --> 00:37:06,420
Is it fulfilling?
Very much so.

00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,822
David...
No!

00:37:07,822 --> 00:37:09,323
...I don't expect...

00:37:09,323 --> 00:37:11,492
No, I need to get this
off my chest before we die.

00:37:11,492 --> 00:37:13,527
Sit down! Sit down!

00:37:13,527 --> 00:37:16,831
My office is exactly
the size it needs to be.

00:37:16,831 --> 00:37:19,166
Morgan is not my girlfriend.

00:37:19,166 --> 00:37:20,367
Sweetheart, what...?

00:37:20,367 --> 00:37:22,436
And I can't save us.

00:37:22,436 --> 00:37:25,840
I'm not this great police guru
that you make me out to be.

00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,808
I can't.

00:37:27,808 --> 00:37:29,076
I'm not perfect.

00:37:29,076 --> 00:37:32,046
All I have is
a love for my job

00:37:32,046 --> 00:37:34,181
and a very
detailed knowledge

00:37:34,181 --> 00:37:35,916
of the physical limitations
of duct tape.

00:37:35,916 --> 00:37:38,185
(gasps)

00:37:38,185 --> 00:37:39,787
What the hell did you do?!

00:37:39,787 --> 00:37:41,155
Haloperidol.

00:37:41,155 --> 00:37:43,257
Thanks for keeping it handy.
Now pull over.

00:37:43,257 --> 00:37:45,059
(over radio):
I have visual on an ambulance.

00:37:45,059 --> 00:37:47,361
(siren wailing)
What are you doing?

00:37:47,361 --> 00:37:49,163
You won't shoot me.

00:37:49,163 --> 00:37:52,266
Not if I keep it at a speed
that will kill us all if you do.

00:37:52,266 --> 00:37:55,769
They're tracking a decoy rig
to the other side of town.

00:37:55,769 --> 00:37:58,072
Nothing between us and
the desert, not even tr...

00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:02,810
Traffic.

00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:04,011
David!

00:38:04,011 --> 00:38:05,746
(siren wails)

00:38:05,746 --> 00:38:07,214
Dispatch, this is 2-Charlie-25
in pursuit of suspect

00:38:07,214 --> 00:38:08,749
northbound on
Tipper Drive.

00:38:08,749 --> 00:38:11,152
2-Charlie-6, lost visual
on suspect vehicle.

00:38:11,152 --> 00:38:12,920
2-Charlie-12,
do you have a visual?

00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:16,524
Control, 2-Charlie-22,
negative visual.

00:38:16,524 --> 00:38:20,194
DISPATCH:
Unit 15, can you get eyes on?

00:38:20,194 --> 00:38:22,363
(sirens wailing)

00:38:22,363 --> 00:38:26,400
<i>Control, 2-Charlie-6,</i>
<i>suspect is evading pursuit.</i>

00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,202
(over radio):
All units converge.

00:38:28,202 --> 00:38:30,137
2-Charlie-12.
Vehicle is cornered.

00:38:30,137 --> 00:38:32,473
(over radio):
Do we have eyes on the hostages?
Are they safe?

00:38:32,473 --> 00:38:34,275
Come on!

00:38:34,275 --> 00:38:36,844
Dispatch, this is Unit Four.
Suspects have been apprehended.

00:38:36,844 --> 00:38:38,846
I repeat,
suspects have been apprehended.

00:38:38,846 --> 00:38:40,114
Yeah!

00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:43,951
(sirens wailing)

00:38:43,951 --> 00:38:45,452
Yes, sir!

00:38:45,452 --> 00:38:48,455
(over radio): 2-Charlie-22.
Suspects apprehended.

00:38:48,455 --> 00:38:50,191
DISPATCH:
Do we have eyes on the hostages?

00:38:50,191 --> 00:38:52,993
Go.

00:38:52,993 --> 00:38:54,195
Okay?

00:38:54,195 --> 00:38:56,830
Okay. Yeah, thanks.

00:39:01,802 --> 00:39:03,003
How did you...?

00:39:03,003 --> 00:39:04,338
Morgan called me.

00:39:04,338 --> 00:39:06,106
Had us switch channels
to flush them out.

00:39:15,482 --> 00:39:18,252
You have to admit it,
as far as plans go,

00:39:18,252 --> 00:39:20,020
this was damn well
thought-out.

00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:22,189
Yeah, she had
a jewelry storefront.

00:39:22,189 --> 00:39:23,958
She could ask all
the right questions,

00:39:23,958 --> 00:39:25,426
and wait for
the perfect weekend.

00:39:25,426 --> 00:39:27,795
While he gets
comfortable as an EMT.

00:39:27,795 --> 00:39:30,264
Learning the roads in
whatever city they're in.

00:39:30,264 --> 00:39:32,233
Police procedures,
escape route.

00:39:32,233 --> 00:39:35,269
Yeah, then the money runs thin,
and they just steal some more.

00:39:35,269 --> 00:39:36,804
Move to a new city.
Uh-huh.

00:39:36,804 --> 00:39:38,372
Did you get
the husband to crack?

00:39:38,372 --> 00:39:41,442
No. In fact, he's taking the rap
for the whole thing.

00:39:41,442 --> 00:39:44,445
Well, he did promise
to love and protect.

00:39:44,445 --> 00:39:46,146
Yeah, which is ironic,
because she threw

00:39:46,146 --> 00:39:48,849
him under the bus
five minutes in.
Women.

00:39:48,849 --> 00:39:52,119
I, uh, found some other stolen
things in the ambulance,

00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:53,821
and if it's okay with you two,

00:39:53,821 --> 00:39:56,156
I'd like to return
one tiny piece of evidence.

00:39:56,156 --> 00:39:57,424
On what grounds?

00:39:57,424 --> 00:39:59,026
It has sentimental value.

00:39:59,026 --> 00:40:01,061
I didn't know you had
sentiments.

00:40:01,061 --> 00:40:03,430
I didn't say they were mine.

00:40:08,102 --> 00:40:10,070
I'm sorry...

00:40:11,171 --> 00:40:12,473
...for the ruse.

00:40:12,473 --> 00:40:15,276
I just wanted you
to be proud of me.

00:40:16,277 --> 00:40:17,778
Proud?

00:40:17,778 --> 00:40:19,847
You saved my life.

00:40:19,847 --> 00:40:24,952
You're great at what you do,
you're loved by so many.

00:40:24,952 --> 00:40:27,354
I couldn't be prouder.

00:40:28,789 --> 00:40:30,991
Besides, I haven't been

00:40:30,991 --> 00:40:35,396
totally honest with you
about my romantic situation.

00:40:35,396 --> 00:40:37,064
What, the Count?

00:40:37,064 --> 00:40:38,766
He wasn't a Count.

00:40:38,766 --> 00:40:40,901
It's possible he doesn't
even know how to.

00:40:42,436 --> 00:40:43,904
He dumped me weeks ago.

00:40:43,904 --> 00:40:46,240
Oh. What about Italy?

00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,442
Oh, the trip's still on.
Non-refundable.

00:40:48,442 --> 00:40:53,047
So it's penne
Bolognese for one.

00:40:53,047 --> 00:40:56,050
(both chuckle)

00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:59,153
You know, I have a few
vacation days saved up.

00:40:59,153 --> 00:41:01,221
Would you like
to have

00:41:01,221 --> 00:41:03,090
a travel <i>amico?</i>

00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:05,526
Ah, David, that's okay.

00:41:05,526 --> 00:41:07,961
You don't have to.

00:41:07,961 --> 00:41:09,263
I know.

00:41:09,263 --> 00:41:10,798
I want to.

00:41:10,798 --> 00:41:13,200
(both laugh gently)

00:41:22,076 --> 00:41:23,777
You found it.

00:41:37,491 --> 00:41:39,860
ALICE:
<i>"The sun was shining</i>
<i>on the sea,</i>

00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:43,731
<i>"shining with all his might.</i>

00:41:43,731 --> 00:41:48,435
"He did his very best to make
the billows smooth and bright.

00:41:48,435 --> 00:41:51,472
"And this was odd because it was
the middle of the night.

00:41:51,472 --> 00:41:53,974
<i>"The moon was shining sulkily</i>

00:41:53,974 --> 00:41:56,276
<i>"because she thought the sun</i>
<i>had got no business to be there</i>

00:41:56,276 --> 00:41:58,746
<i>"after the day was done.</i>

00:41:58,746 --> 00:42:00,514
<i>"'It's very rude of him,'</i>
<i>she said,</i>

00:42:00,514 --> 00:42:03,317
<i>"'to come and spoil the fun!'</i>

00:42:03,317 --> 00:42:05,386
<i>"The sea was wet</i>
<i>as wet could be,</i>

00:42:05,386 --> 00:42:07,020
<i>"The sands were dry as dry.</i>

00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:09,056
<i>"You could not see a cloud</i>

00:42:09,056 --> 00:42:11,992
<i>"because no cloud was in</i>
<i>the sky.</i>

00:42:11,992 --> 00:42:16,029
<i>"No birds were flying overhead,</i>
<i>there were no birds to fly.</i>

00:42:16,029 --> 00:42:20,134
<i>"The Walrus and the Carpenter</i>
<i>were walking close at hand.</i>

00:42:22,236 --> 00:42:25,973
<i>"They wept like anything to see</i>
<i>such quantities of sand.</i>

00:42:30,344 --> 00:42:32,413
"'If this were only cleared
away,' they said,

00:42:32,413 --> 00:42:35,215
"'it would be grand!'

00:42:35,215 --> 00:42:39,153
"If seven maids with seven mops
swept it for half a year,

00:42:39,153 --> 00:42:41,755
"'Do you suppose,'
the Walrus said,

00:42:41,755 --> 00:42:45,159
"'That they could
get it clear?'

00:42:45,159 --> 00:42:50,097
(voice breaks): "'I doubt it,'
said the Carpenter,

00:42:50,097 --> 00:42:53,233
and shed a bitter tear."
