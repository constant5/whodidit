00:10:08,002 --> 00:10:09,203
She was afraid to say.

00:10:09,203 --> 00:10:12,340
So we're still not sure, right?

00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,308
I'm sure that it got her killed.

00:10:16,243 --> 00:10:18,012
Did you take
their statements yet?

00:10:18,012 --> 00:10:19,313
(chuckles)

00:10:19,313 --> 00:10:21,282
No, they, uh...
they lawyered up.

00:10:21,282 --> 00:10:24,885
But I'm having a little trouble
with their story anyway.

00:10:24,885 --> 00:10:26,387
You know, I confirmed
the weather conditions

00:10:26,387 --> 00:10:27,588
where we found the bodies.

00:10:27,588 --> 00:10:29,657
Now, given the cold
and the rain,

00:10:29,657 --> 00:10:32,093
we really shouldn't have found
any beetles out there at all.

00:10:32,093 --> 00:10:34,095
And the condition
of the bodies

00:10:34,095 --> 00:10:35,529
suggests that bugs had
been eating on them

00:10:35,529 --> 00:10:36,597
for at least a week.

00:10:36,597 --> 00:10:38,633
Well, forget a week.

00:10:38,633 --> 00:10:40,868
How about 14 hours?

00:10:40,868 --> 00:10:43,571
What?
Vartann interviewed
Malcolm Turner's widow.

00:10:43,571 --> 00:10:45,239
She talked to
her husband's receptionist

00:10:45,239 --> 00:10:47,074
around 8:00 last night.

00:10:47,074 --> 00:10:49,143
Which means all our victims
had to have been in the office

00:10:49,143 --> 00:10:51,012
around that time.
No, no-- 8:00 p.m.
last night?

00:10:51,012 --> 00:10:52,380
That's impossible.

00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:55,216
The bodies were picked clean
by this morning.

00:10:55,216 --> 00:10:58,152
(rattling)

00:11:00,621 --> 00:11:03,891
(beetles churring)

00:11:03,891 --> 00:11:06,093
Have you eaten lunch yet?

00:11:07,628 --> 00:11:10,865
Well, I hope
they like it extra crispy.

00:11:10,865 --> 00:11:14,535
(chuckles) No, they're
actually a little bit
smarter than we are.

00:11:14,535 --> 00:11:15,970
They like it healthy,

00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:18,072
so I'll get the
skin off here...

00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:24,612
There you go.

00:11:24,612 --> 00:11:26,580
Bon appétit, gentlemen.

00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,883
(churring)

00:11:32,186 --> 00:11:33,921
Now-now... now,
wait a minute.

00:11:33,921 --> 00:11:36,057
You know we can't
eat in here, dude.

00:11:36,057 --> 00:11:38,325
Well, I won't tell Russell
if you don't.

00:11:40,161 --> 00:11:41,295
Yeah, okay, sounds like a deal.

00:11:52,339 --> 00:11:55,042
VARTANN:
Surveillance confirms that
Malcolm Turner and his staff

00:11:55,042 --> 00:11:56,977
arrived for work at 7:48 a.m.

00:11:56,977 --> 00:12:00,181
Now, the phone logs say
that they worked all day,

00:12:00,181 --> 00:12:01,649
and that they ordered lunch in.

00:12:01,649 --> 00:12:03,117
No sign of
them leaving?
Nope.

00:12:03,117 --> 00:12:04,518
Their cars are still
in the garage.

00:12:04,518 --> 00:12:05,886
So how'd they make
the big reverse commute

00:12:05,886 --> 00:12:08,489
back to the mountains?

00:12:08,489 --> 00:12:10,891
SIDLE: It does not look like
they were killed here.

00:12:10,891 --> 00:12:12,326
BRODY: What?
They just vanished?

00:12:12,326 --> 00:12:14,261
Janitorial came through
at quarter to 9:00.

00:12:14,261 --> 00:12:15,896
They found the place
locked, nobody here,

00:12:15,896 --> 00:12:19,300
and they saw nothing
out of the ordinary.

00:12:21,202 --> 00:12:22,536
(Morgan laughs)

00:12:22,536 --> 00:12:24,538
I gotta get these guys
to clean my place.

00:12:24,538 --> 00:12:26,407
Not a single smudge or print.

00:12:26,407 --> 00:12:27,975
You know, the only janitor
I know who's this thorough

00:12:27,975 --> 00:12:29,477
turned out to be
a serial killer.

00:12:29,477 --> 00:12:31,278
What do we know about
this cleaning crew?

00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:33,581
Same guys who've been cleaning
this office every night

00:12:33,581 --> 00:12:34,949
for the last seven years.

00:12:34,949 --> 00:12:36,517
BRODY:
Okay.

00:12:36,517 --> 00:12:38,119
So, if these guys
didn't give the place

00:12:38,119 --> 00:12:40,621
the white glove treatment, who
did?

00:12:40,621 --> 00:12:42,656
(churring)

00:12:42,656 --> 00:12:44,325
It's amazing.

00:12:44,325 --> 00:12:46,627
They picked it clean
in less than an hour.

00:12:46,627 --> 00:12:48,129
Yeah. They eat
even faster than you.

00:12:48,129 --> 00:12:49,964
(wry laugh)

00:12:49,964 --> 00:12:52,366
Well, they eat faster than any
hide beetles I've ever seen.

00:12:52,366 --> 00:12:56,170
Maybe that's why the decomp
was inconsistent with T.O.D.

00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:58,172
Super beetles.

00:12:58,172 --> 00:12:59,406
STOKES: They're
some kind of different,

00:12:59,406 --> 00:13:00,508
I'll say that.

00:13:00,508 --> 00:13:03,611
Question is... how?

00:13:03,611 --> 00:13:05,279
Genetic anomaly?

00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,615
Freaks of nature?

00:13:07,615 --> 00:13:10,651
It's definitely an
entomological mystery.

00:13:13,187 --> 00:13:16,924
Where did you come from,
you little beasts?

00:13:21,428 --> 00:13:24,165
(scoffs)

00:13:27,568 --> 00:13:35,509
♪ ♪

00:14:21,155 --> 00:14:29,063
♪ ♪

00:14:48,949 --> 00:14:50,117
Whew.

00:15:01,262 --> 00:15:04,565
(crying)

00:15:04,565 --> 00:15:06,000
(screams)
(gunshot)

00:15:08,035 --> 00:15:09,970
This office
is definitely our primary,

00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:13,207
but only you, me, the walls
and the carpet know it.

00:15:13,207 --> 00:15:15,242
And do you smell what I smell?
Nothing.

00:15:15,242 --> 00:15:16,410
No bleach.

00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:18,145
They used ethanol
to destroy the DNA.

00:15:18,145 --> 00:15:19,246
Smart.

00:15:19,246 --> 00:15:20,547
Any blood, fingerprints,

00:15:20,547 --> 00:15:22,016
any trace of what happened
in here is gone.

00:15:22,016 --> 00:15:23,117
They even walked
the bodies out of here

00:15:23,117 --> 00:15:24,451
without anybody noticing.

00:15:24,451 --> 00:15:25,986
Call log said the last call
came in at 8:07.

00:15:25,986 --> 00:15:28,188
Janitorial crew got here
at quarter to 9:00.

00:15:28,188 --> 00:15:30,090
We're talking less
than 45 minutes.

00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:32,359
Russell said the hit
was professional.

00:15:32,359 --> 00:15:33,994
Clean-up was professional, too.

00:15:33,994 --> 00:15:35,596
Who are these guys?

00:15:40,601 --> 00:15:43,037
BRODY: I checked surveillance
covering the 45 minutes

00:15:43,037 --> 00:15:45,572
it took our bad guys
to kill and clean.

00:15:45,572 --> 00:15:47,141
According to Skadden Springs,

00:15:47,141 --> 00:15:49,176
there were no scheduled
deliveries last night.

00:15:49,176 --> 00:15:51,912
Okay, so bogus delivery guy.

00:15:51,912 --> 00:15:53,914
BRODY:
That's not the only thing
that was bogus.

00:15:53,914 --> 00:15:55,950
We were wondering
how they got the bodies out.

00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:58,352
I think I can answer that.

00:15:58,352 --> 00:16:00,554
At 8:02, three men delivered
office furniture

00:16:00,554 --> 00:16:02,056
to the building.

00:16:02,056 --> 00:16:03,357
And at 8:47,

00:16:03,357 --> 00:16:04,925
just as the janitors

00:16:04,925 --> 00:16:07,094
were entering
the legal office upstairs,

00:16:07,094 --> 00:16:09,296
the same three guys
came back out...

00:16:09,296 --> 00:16:11,298
With the exact
same furniture.

00:16:11,298 --> 00:16:12,900
Maybe just a little heavier.

00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,034
Oh, look!

00:16:14,034 --> 00:16:16,103
There's our water guy again.

00:16:16,103 --> 00:16:18,105
What do you want to bet,
he was delivering ethanol?

00:16:18,105 --> 00:16:20,574
"Jordan's Office Supply."

00:16:20,574 --> 00:16:22,543
I ran it.
Company doesn't exist.
(laughs)

00:16:22,543 --> 00:16:24,912
These guys are good.
Organized.

00:16:24,912 --> 00:16:26,347
Covert. Precise.

00:16:26,347 --> 00:16:27,614
If I didn't know any better,

00:16:27,614 --> 00:16:29,149
I'd say
they had military training.

00:16:29,149 --> 00:16:30,985
Yeah, just like the army,
every squad

00:16:30,985 --> 00:16:32,920
needs a squad leader.

00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:36,190
Four paths converged

00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:38,892
in a service area,
and they took the path

00:16:38,892 --> 00:16:40,294
most traveled by...

00:16:40,294 --> 00:16:41,628
What're you getting at?

00:16:41,628 --> 00:16:43,364
Walk these guys
back out again.

00:16:43,364 --> 00:16:44,965
Yeah, look at this.

00:16:44,965 --> 00:16:46,433
"Hello, boss."
"Hey, nice work."

00:16:46,433 --> 00:16:47,634
See, they're talking
to each other.

00:16:47,634 --> 00:16:49,470
"Ah, well done."

00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:50,604
"Thanks, boss."

00:16:50,604 --> 00:16:52,172
When was the last time

00:16:52,172 --> 00:16:55,009
you saw anyone wear
a raincoat in Vegas?

00:16:55,009 --> 00:16:56,176
I think I can answer that.

00:16:56,176 --> 00:16:58,078
(typing)

00:16:58,078 --> 00:16:59,646
Just after 8:00 p.m.,
guy in the raincoat

00:16:59,646 --> 00:17:02,216
got on the elevator.

00:17:02,216 --> 00:17:04,084
Ten minutes later, he got off.

00:17:04,084 --> 00:17:05,619
After the murders.
All right,

00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:08,022
so we got our cleaning
crew and our hit team.

00:17:08,022 --> 00:17:09,623
Let's take a closer
look at these guys.

00:17:09,623 --> 00:17:11,658
Pull their faces
out of the crowd.

00:17:11,658 --> 00:17:14,294
(churring)

00:17:17,398 --> 00:17:18,632
Rest in peace, little man.

00:17:38,285 --> 00:17:39,286
Hey, Nick. What's up?

00:17:39,286 --> 00:17:41,088
Well, that's just it.

00:17:41,088 --> 00:17:42,523
I'm not real sure,
and I could use your help.

00:17:42,523 --> 00:17:44,191
Okay?
Okay.

00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,926
Greg and I did a
little experiment

00:17:45,926 --> 00:17:47,961
with the beetles we found
at the dump site.

00:17:47,961 --> 00:17:49,596
They have an appetite unlike

00:17:49,596 --> 00:17:51,198
any other bug
I've ever seen before.

00:17:51,198 --> 00:17:53,467
Check that out.
Now...

00:17:53,467 --> 00:17:56,870
that explains how the bodies
were picked clean in half a day,

00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:58,105
but it doesn't explain this.

00:18:01,175 --> 00:18:02,342
What am I looking at?

00:18:02,342 --> 00:18:04,111
That's the beetle's equipment.

00:18:04,111 --> 00:18:05,913
Enhanced.
Obviously.

00:18:05,913 --> 00:18:08,248
And completely useless.

00:18:08,248 --> 00:18:11,385
Well, my guess is,
they were irradiated.

00:18:11,385 --> 00:18:13,887
Where are you going with this?

00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:17,891
I think someone's
bioengineering these bugs.

00:18:17,891 --> 00:18:19,960
I know it sounds
crazy, but it's like

00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,362
something has switched off
their "I'm full" button,

00:18:22,362 --> 00:18:24,932
made them great eaters,
bad breeders,

00:18:24,932 --> 00:18:27,301
so that they do their job,
and they just disappear.

00:18:27,301 --> 00:18:29,303
Along with their dinner.
Yeah.

00:18:29,303 --> 00:18:31,171
Pretty crazy, right?

00:18:31,171 --> 00:18:32,906
No. No.

00:18:32,906 --> 00:18:35,008
That's... Actually,
that's pretty consistent

00:18:35,008 --> 00:18:36,910
with Mark Gabriel
and Ceressus.

00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:39,313
That company is into
all kinds of covert ops,

00:18:39,313 --> 00:18:40,614
weapons development,
you name it.

00:18:40,614 --> 00:18:43,217
(cell phone chimes)

00:18:45,052 --> 00:18:46,987
Ballistics came back
from our victims.

00:18:46,987 --> 00:18:50,457
The main caliber used
was a 5.7 by 28.

00:18:50,457 --> 00:18:52,092
5.7 by 28.

00:18:52,092 --> 00:18:53,894
That's the same caliber
as the bullets

00:18:53,894 --> 00:18:55,429
that killed that ballistics
expert last month, right?

00:18:55,429 --> 00:18:57,297
That's the same caliber
as the assault rifles

00:18:57,297 --> 00:19:00,100
that went missing in Pakistan
and ended up here in Vegas.

00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,435
But I thought we got all those
off the streets.

00:19:01,435 --> 00:19:03,403
Apparently not.
Okay, but

00:19:03,403 --> 00:19:05,472
Mark Gabriel claimed he had
nothing to do with those guns.

00:19:05,472 --> 00:19:07,040
Yeah, just like he had nothing

00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,208
to do with his wife's
disappearance.

00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:10,077
(dialing)
So who you calling now?

00:19:10,077 --> 00:19:13,080
The FBI.

00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,915
AGENT PRATT:
<i>Look.</i>

00:19:14,915 --> 00:19:18,318
I'm sorry, a few bullets
and bugs isn't enough for us

00:19:18,318 --> 00:19:20,087
to put the target back
on Mark Gabriel.

00:19:20,087 --> 00:19:22,356
What about his wife and
her lawyer coming forward?

00:19:22,356 --> 00:19:24,658
Laura Gabriel was coming to you
with information.

00:19:24,658 --> 00:19:26,226
So the FBI is brought in
on a case,

00:19:26,226 --> 00:19:27,528
and nobody thinks to call me?

00:19:27,528 --> 00:19:29,596
Jim...
Yeah, actually,
no, it was my bad.

00:19:29,596 --> 00:19:31,398
I-I called them.

00:19:31,398 --> 00:19:32,566
I should've given you
a heads-up.

00:19:34,067 --> 00:19:36,170
Okay.

00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:38,205
The heads-up can start now.

00:19:38,205 --> 00:19:41,041
Well, you remember Special
Agents Pratt and McQuaid.

00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:42,276
You're working
the Ceressus case.

00:19:42,276 --> 00:19:44,411
And they just agreed
to provide background

00:19:44,411 --> 00:19:48,081
that might help us out
on our current investigation.

00:19:48,081 --> 00:19:49,917
Isn't that right?

00:19:49,917 --> 00:19:51,084
That's about right.

00:19:51,084 --> 00:19:52,119
RUSSELL:
Because the truth is,

00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:53,187
you wouldn't have responded

00:19:53,187 --> 00:19:54,488
quickly to my phone call

00:19:54,488 --> 00:19:55,923
if you didn't think
that Mark Gabriel

00:19:55,923 --> 00:19:57,891
was guilty of more
than gunrunning.

00:19:57,891 --> 00:19:59,960
Right?

00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,461
We've had reason to believe
that Ceressus's been engaged

00:20:01,461 --> 00:20:04,064
in a number of illegal
activities here in the U.S.

00:20:04,064 --> 00:20:05,332
BRASS: What illegal
activities

00:20:05,332 --> 00:20:06,533
exactly are you talking about?

00:20:10,204 --> 00:20:11,405
Full disclosure.

00:20:11,405 --> 00:20:14,374
That would be refreshing.

00:20:14,374 --> 00:20:16,877
We've been looking at Mark
Gabriel for almost a year now.

00:20:16,877 --> 00:20:19,346
We believe that Ceressus is
heavily involved in gunrunning,

00:20:19,346 --> 00:20:21,982
corporate espionage, computer
hacking-- the list goes on.

00:20:21,982 --> 00:20:24,384
Bringing their international
expertise to a domestic market.

00:20:24,384 --> 00:20:25,586
Corporations.
Cartels.

00:20:25,586 --> 00:20:27,020
Whoever's got the
highest bid.

00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,388
How about murder for hire?

00:20:30,224 --> 00:20:32,492
Okay. I guess
we take that as a yes.

00:20:32,492 --> 00:20:34,261
Okay. What have you got?

00:20:34,261 --> 00:20:36,296
A lot more than you think.

00:20:36,296 --> 00:20:38,232
You know these people?

00:20:38,232 --> 00:20:39,933
Yeah, we've seen them before,

00:20:39,933 --> 00:20:41,201
but we haven't been
able to connect them

00:20:41,201 --> 00:20:43,303
to Ceressus or
Mark Gabriel.

00:20:43,303 --> 00:20:45,239
I mean, the guy
doesn't make mistakes.

00:20:45,239 --> 00:20:46,940
Thank you
for the full disclosure.

00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:49,009
As for the mistakes,
I beg to differ.

00:20:50,477 --> 00:20:52,579
He made three.

00:20:57,217 --> 00:20:59,653
I'm sorry
about your friend.

00:20:59,653 --> 00:21:00,988
(sighs)

00:21:00,988 --> 00:21:03,457
Me, too.

00:21:03,457 --> 00:21:05,459
Hey, look, I was going
to call you, but...

00:21:05,459 --> 00:21:07,494
It's probably better
that you didn't.

00:21:07,494 --> 00:21:09,563
(sighs)

00:21:09,563 --> 00:21:10,931
Maybe we could...

00:21:10,931 --> 00:21:12,299
We've got work to do.

00:21:13,934 --> 00:21:16,870
Yeah.

00:21:21,008 --> 00:21:23,944
Hey. Who was that?

00:21:23,944 --> 00:21:26,947
He's Jim McQuaid
with the FBI.

00:21:26,947 --> 00:21:29,616
They're cooperating
on the Gabriel case.

00:21:29,616 --> 00:21:33,020
I ran down Laura
Gabriel's financials.

00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,888
She closed out her bank
account five days ago.

00:21:34,888 --> 00:21:38,325
Withdrew $28,000.

00:21:38,325 --> 00:21:39,660
Sounds like
she was scared.

00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,628
Maybe she tried
to go on the run.

00:21:41,628 --> 00:21:43,063
Well, I don't think
she got very far.

00:21:43,063 --> 00:21:44,898
Activity on her cell phone
stopped the day

00:21:44,898 --> 00:21:48,001
before the hit
at the law office.

00:21:48,001 --> 00:21:49,002
You all right?

00:21:49,002 --> 00:21:50,003
I will be.

00:21:50,003 --> 00:21:51,405
When we nail Gabriel.

00:21:56,109 --> 00:21:58,045
Mom.

00:21:58,045 --> 00:21:59,346
What are you
doing here?

00:21:59,346 --> 00:22:01,648
At the desk,
they said it was okay.

00:22:01,648 --> 00:22:04,117
Well, sure, it's okay,
but why are you here?

00:22:04,117 --> 00:22:06,119
This came in my mail,

00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:10,390
but the card
was meant for you.

00:22:15,329 --> 00:22:17,397
"Catherine, sorry I
couldn't make it.

00:22:17,397 --> 00:22:19,132
I tried.
David Campbell."

00:22:21,068 --> 00:22:22,102
David Campbell?!

00:22:22,102 --> 00:22:23,236
I know.

00:22:23,236 --> 00:22:24,871
Laura's father.

00:22:24,871 --> 00:22:26,940
I-I-I...
I don't understand.

00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:29,142
The man died
20 years ago.

00:22:29,142 --> 00:22:31,912
Catherine, what is going on?

00:22:31,912 --> 00:22:35,248
Did something
happen to Laura?

00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:38,485
Has anyone else touched this?

00:22:38,485 --> 00:22:41,221
Just me, the mailman,
and now you.

00:22:43,023 --> 00:22:45,659
I'm going to have someone
escort you home.

00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:47,461
Card's the same story
as the envelope.

00:22:47,461 --> 00:22:48,628
Besides you and your mom,

00:22:48,628 --> 00:22:51,098
just partials;
nothing usable.

00:22:51,098 --> 00:22:53,934
I'll swab it for DNA.

00:22:53,934 --> 00:22:55,168
Laura mailed the card

00:22:55,168 --> 00:22:57,504
a day before the murders
at the law office

00:22:57,504 --> 00:22:59,639
and sent it directly
from a post office

00:22:59,639 --> 00:23:02,008
in Pahrump.
She wanted to make sure
you got it.

00:23:02,008 --> 00:23:04,111
And make sure that Gabriel
didn't intercept it.

00:23:04,111 --> 00:23:05,912
That's why she sent it
to my mom.

00:23:05,912 --> 00:23:08,548
You really think Mark Gabriel
is reading your mail?

00:23:08,548 --> 00:23:10,150
I wouldn't put anything
past him.

00:23:11,952 --> 00:23:14,654
You and Laura close?

00:23:14,654 --> 00:23:16,523
(laughs)
Yeah.

00:23:16,523 --> 00:23:18,358
At one time, yeah.

00:23:18,358 --> 00:23:19,893
When we were kids,
Laura's house

00:23:19,893 --> 00:23:21,661
was like my second home.

00:23:21,661 --> 00:23:23,130
Until Sam, her dad

00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:24,931
was like the closest
thing I had to a father.

00:23:24,931 --> 00:23:28,301
We were like sisters.

00:23:28,301 --> 00:23:31,605
This card play music
when you got it?

00:23:31,605 --> 00:23:36,276
Well, no, but I just
assumed it wasn't working.

00:23:38,545 --> 00:23:41,181
Well, I think I know
why you got cheated

00:23:41,181 --> 00:23:42,382
out of a birthday song.

00:23:42,382 --> 00:23:44,084
This is a cell phone
memory card.

00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:48,021
JOHNSON:
So I ran the memory card.

00:23:48,021 --> 00:23:50,157
It's not Laura's.

00:23:50,157 --> 00:23:51,458
It's registered
to Mark Gabriel.

00:23:51,458 --> 00:23:53,059
And this is all that's on it?

00:23:53,059 --> 00:23:54,294
Ah, pictures of the Gabriels

00:23:54,294 --> 00:23:55,996
over the last year.
Why would Laura go

00:23:55,996 --> 00:23:58,231
to all that trouble
to send me vacation photos?

00:23:58,231 --> 00:23:59,499
If you didn't know
any better, you'd

00:23:59,499 --> 00:24:02,002
think they had a
pretty wonderful life.

00:24:02,002 --> 00:24:03,870
You know, there
was one picture, though,

00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:05,639
that seemed a little
out of place.
Show me.

00:24:05,639 --> 00:24:08,175
Yeah.

00:24:08,175 --> 00:24:09,576
Some kind of weird
self-portrait.

00:24:09,576 --> 00:24:12,145
En-Enlarge it, please.
Yeah.

00:24:16,183 --> 00:24:18,251
I know that house.

00:24:18,251 --> 00:24:19,586
I've been there
when I was a kid.

00:24:19,586 --> 00:24:21,154
That's Laura's cousin's house.

00:24:21,154 --> 00:24:24,458
(sirens wailing)

00:24:49,983 --> 00:24:51,485
LVPD!

00:25:08,969 --> 00:25:11,605
Blowflies.

00:25:11,605 --> 00:25:12,939
Copper in the air.

00:25:26,953 --> 00:25:30,957
(door creaking, banging)

00:25:48,275 --> 00:25:50,510
Is it Laura?

00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:52,212
It's Laura's cousin Helen...

00:25:52,212 --> 00:25:54,247
and Helen's husband.

00:25:54,247 --> 00:25:55,949
Both shot in
the head.

00:25:55,949 --> 00:25:57,517
She took a beating.

00:25:59,219 --> 00:26:02,422
So where's Laura?

00:26:12,999 --> 00:26:14,501
When we were kids,
we played here.

00:26:14,501 --> 00:26:17,304
Laura's granddad grew up
in the Depression.

00:26:17,304 --> 00:26:19,005
Didn't trust banks.

00:26:19,005 --> 00:26:24,477
So, when he built
this house, he made sure

00:26:24,477 --> 00:26:25,879
that he would never need

00:26:25,879 --> 00:26:28,515
any banks
to keep his money safe.

00:26:43,163 --> 00:26:44,364
Laura!

00:26:54,207 --> 00:26:56,142
RUSSELL (over phone):
Laura Gabriel's alive?

00:26:56,142 --> 00:26:58,612
Yeah. We found her hiding in
a crawl space under the house.

00:26:58,612 --> 00:27:00,513
Catherine's talking
to her right now.

00:27:00,513 --> 00:27:02,482
You think it's the same crew
that hit the law office?

00:27:02,482 --> 00:27:04,884
Oh, it doesn't look like it.
The place is a mess.

00:27:04,884 --> 00:27:06,186
Unless they're losing
their touch.

00:27:06,186 --> 00:27:08,254
Maybe they got interrupted.

00:27:08,254 --> 00:27:09,389
Okay.

00:27:09,389 --> 00:27:10,890
Uh, finish processing the scene.

00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:12,525
I'll let the FBI guys know.

00:27:12,525 --> 00:27:15,629
I got it.

00:27:15,629 --> 00:27:17,597
It happened so fast.

00:27:19,165 --> 00:27:21,034
I heard them break in.

00:27:21,034 --> 00:27:23,436
Helen told me to hide.

00:27:23,436 --> 00:27:24,904
<i>They had Derek.</i>

00:27:24,904 --> 00:27:26,640
<i>They were yelling at him.</i>

00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,941
<i>Helen was screaming.</i>

00:27:27,941 --> 00:27:29,109
Please don't shoot him!

00:27:29,109 --> 00:27:30,377
(gun fires)
HELEN:
No!

00:27:30,377 --> 00:27:32,212
(sobbing)

00:27:32,212 --> 00:27:33,880
<i>Next thing I know,</i>
<i>they were shouting at her.</i>

00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,182
<i>Hitting her.</i>

00:27:36,182 --> 00:27:38,385
(sobbing):
Please...
<i>And then...</i>

00:27:38,385 --> 00:27:41,621
She wouldn't tell them.

00:27:41,621 --> 00:27:43,423
They were beating her,

00:27:43,423 --> 00:27:45,625
and she still wouldn't
tell them anything.

00:27:45,625 --> 00:27:47,193
Could you tell
how many there were?

00:27:47,193 --> 00:27:48,395
No.

00:27:48,395 --> 00:27:51,564
I heard one of them.

00:27:51,564 --> 00:27:53,133
He got a phone call.

00:27:53,133 --> 00:27:55,235
Sounded like he had an accent.

00:27:55,235 --> 00:27:57,904
After that, they left.

00:27:57,904 --> 00:28:01,441
When I heard footsteps again,
I thought they'd come back.

00:28:01,441 --> 00:28:04,511
I was sure that
they'd find me.

00:28:04,511 --> 00:28:06,613
(sobbing):
But it was you.

00:28:08,281 --> 00:28:11,284
Laura. Laura.

00:28:11,284 --> 00:28:12,519
What is it
that you know

00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:14,154
that has Mark so worried?

00:28:16,623 --> 00:28:19,926
Remember when I told you
I overheard something?

00:28:21,428 --> 00:28:26,066
One night, Mark was in
the study with a man.

00:28:26,066 --> 00:28:28,301
They were talking about
cleaning the offices

00:28:28,301 --> 00:28:29,536
of Stanley Merrill.

00:28:29,536 --> 00:28:32,138
Why do I know that name?

00:28:32,138 --> 00:28:34,174
Stanley Merrill
was a military contractor,

00:28:34,174 --> 00:28:36,109
rival of Mark's.

00:28:36,109 --> 00:28:38,011
Went missing
11 months ago.

00:28:38,011 --> 00:28:40,313
Mark killed him. I know it.

00:28:40,313 --> 00:28:42,348
You're here,

00:28:42,348 --> 00:28:44,918
so I'm assuming
you got the card I sent?

00:28:44,918 --> 00:28:47,253
Yeah, and the memory card

00:28:47,253 --> 00:28:49,189
with the photo
that you took.

00:28:49,189 --> 00:28:51,091
You knew that I'd
recognize the house.

00:28:51,091 --> 00:28:53,426
There were more photos
on that memory card.

00:28:53,426 --> 00:28:54,627
Yeah, the vacation photos.

00:28:54,627 --> 00:28:56,229
More than that.

00:28:56,229 --> 00:28:57,997
What do you mean?

00:28:57,997 --> 00:28:59,365
When Mark conducted business,
he always swapped out

00:28:59,365 --> 00:29:02,135
the memory card on his phone.

00:29:02,135 --> 00:29:04,070
That one was in his pocket.
I took it.

00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:06,473
I know Mark.

00:29:06,473 --> 00:29:08,475
There has to be something more.

00:29:29,462 --> 00:29:31,364
HODGES: There really is
nothing more tedious

00:29:31,364 --> 00:29:33,099
than to have to sit
through a slide show

00:29:33,099 --> 00:29:35,935
of somebody else's
vacation photos.

00:29:35,935 --> 00:29:37,170
My mother went
to Anguilla

00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:39,372
over Christmas
with her new boyfriend.

00:29:39,372 --> 00:29:41,040
He's a regular
Ansel Adams.

00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:45,411
I sat through four hours
of sand, sea and sunset.

00:29:45,411 --> 00:29:47,080
I didn't know your mom
had a new boyfriend.

00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,381
Yeah, I don't want
to talk about it.

00:29:48,381 --> 00:29:50,517
Good. Me, neither.
What are you doing?

00:29:50,517 --> 00:29:52,385
Catherine thinks there's
some kind of information

00:29:52,385 --> 00:29:53,386
hidden in these images.

00:29:53,386 --> 00:29:54,988
Steganography.

00:29:54,988 --> 00:29:56,356
The art of embedding data
within data.

00:29:56,356 --> 00:29:58,591
So I'm analyzing
the noise levels to see

00:29:58,591 --> 00:30:02,228
if there are any data packets
embedded in these pixels.

00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,903
Have you checked
the noise levels on this marlin?

00:30:09,903 --> 00:30:11,971
No, not yet.
Haven't gotten there. Why?

00:30:11,971 --> 00:30:14,207
Well, I'm no expert,
but this little

00:30:14,207 --> 00:30:15,441
Punxsutawney Phil of the sea

00:30:15,441 --> 00:30:19,979
isn't seeing his shadow.

00:30:19,979 --> 00:30:22,048
You're right--
no shadow.

00:30:22,048 --> 00:30:23,550
This fish has been Photoshopped.

00:30:26,419 --> 00:30:28,388
These noise levels
are off the charts.

00:30:28,388 --> 00:30:30,657
There's definitely data
embedded in this fish.

00:30:30,657 --> 00:30:32,358
Let's gut it.

00:30:32,358 --> 00:30:34,194
Running it through
steganalysis decryption...

00:30:34,194 --> 00:30:37,096
now.

00:30:39,899 --> 00:30:42,869
Numbers.

00:30:42,869 --> 00:30:44,437
Could be a code?

00:30:44,437 --> 00:30:46,272
Yeah.

00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:48,474
PRATT:
<i>So, Mr. Martens,</i>

00:30:48,474 --> 00:30:50,877
is there a reason why
Mark Gabriel sent his number two

00:30:50,877 --> 00:30:52,111
instead of coming
here himself?

00:30:52,111 --> 00:30:53,980
Mr. Gabriel had
an important conference.

00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,615
He sends his regrets.

00:30:55,615 --> 00:30:56,482
I'm sure he does.

00:30:56,482 --> 00:30:59,018
PRATT:
So, as the CFO

00:30:59,018 --> 00:31:01,187
of Ceressus,
you're the money guy.

00:31:01,187 --> 00:31:02,222
And legal counsel.

00:31:02,222 --> 00:31:04,390
What's this about?

00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:06,025
Well, we went on a little, uh,

00:31:06,025 --> 00:31:08,161
fishing expedition,
and we found

00:31:08,161 --> 00:31:09,996
a bunch of numbers embedded

00:31:09,996 --> 00:31:11,865
in this image right here.

00:31:11,865 --> 00:31:13,900
First, we thought
that they were code,

00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:16,369
but then we realized
that they were actually numbers

00:31:16,369 --> 00:31:18,304
and dates of transactions.

00:31:18,304 --> 00:31:19,906
PRATT: Recording monies
being wired

00:31:19,906 --> 00:31:21,341
from a subsidiary
of Ceressus

00:31:21,341 --> 00:31:23,109
to a single account
in a Swiss bank.

00:31:23,109 --> 00:31:25,011
And where did you get
this information?

00:31:25,011 --> 00:31:27,347
Ah, well, that's all
very cloak-and-dagger.

00:31:27,347 --> 00:31:28,982
But here's where
it gets interesting.

00:31:28,982 --> 00:31:32,185
The actual dates
of the transactions.

00:31:32,185 --> 00:31:34,387
PRATT: 11 months ago,
your boss's rival,

00:31:34,387 --> 00:31:35,989
Stanley Merrill, disappears.

00:31:35,989 --> 00:31:38,591
And money goes to Switzerland.

00:31:38,591 --> 00:31:40,226
I don't know anything
about that.

00:31:40,226 --> 00:31:41,561
Four weeks ago, Lenny Wesson,

00:31:41,561 --> 00:31:43,363
witness against Ceressus,
dies in custody.

00:31:43,363 --> 00:31:45,865
And money goes to Switzerland.

00:31:45,865 --> 00:31:48,968
These numbers are meaningless.

00:31:48,968 --> 00:31:51,004
Four days ago, Malcolm Turner,
lawyer to your boss's wife,

00:31:51,004 --> 00:31:53,940
who'd agreed to come forward
with information, is murdered.

00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:56,876
Once again, the Swiss economy
gets a shot in the arm.

00:31:56,876 --> 00:31:58,511
Now...

00:31:58,511 --> 00:32:01,481
I know that your law degree
is telling you

00:32:01,481 --> 00:32:03,082
that we don't have enough
to make a case,

00:32:03,082 --> 00:32:05,251
but sooner or later,
someone's going to talk.

00:32:05,251 --> 00:32:08,388
And my common sense degree
tells me

00:32:08,388 --> 00:32:10,356
sooner would be a lot better
for you.

00:32:13,126 --> 00:32:16,396
Look, I have no knowledge
of this subsidiary of Ceressus,

00:32:16,396 --> 00:32:18,898
and I don't know anything
about these transactions.

00:32:18,898 --> 00:32:20,266
All right.

00:32:20,266 --> 00:32:22,869
You know them?

00:32:24,904 --> 00:32:26,072
These men? No.

00:32:30,343 --> 00:32:33,479
This man,
I'm sorry to say, I do.

00:32:33,479 --> 00:32:35,248
Who is he?

00:32:35,248 --> 00:32:38,384
A contractor who's done work
for Ceressus abroad.

00:32:38,384 --> 00:32:39,519
What kind of work?

00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:41,220
I think you know the answer.

00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,488
To my knowledge,

00:32:42,488 --> 00:32:45,191
we've never called
on his expertise

00:32:45,191 --> 00:32:46,592
for any assignments
in this country,

00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:48,428
nor would I ever
sanction it.

00:32:48,428 --> 00:32:50,463
Well, sounds to me

00:32:50,463 --> 00:32:52,298
like someone left you
holding the bag.

00:32:54,367 --> 00:32:56,436
Or perhaps given me reason
to cooperate.

00:32:59,505 --> 00:33:01,574
I'm going to need cover.

00:33:01,574 --> 00:33:03,142
RUSSELL:
Okay.

00:33:03,142 --> 00:33:05,211
Now we're getting someplace.

00:33:07,213 --> 00:33:08,982
I've got some
good news.

00:33:08,982 --> 00:33:10,183
You're not going to be
alone in coming forward.

00:33:10,183 --> 00:33:11,617
What do you mean?

00:33:11,617 --> 00:33:15,221
Someone else has agreed
to cooperate with the FBI.

00:33:15,221 --> 00:33:16,489
Who?

00:33:16,489 --> 00:33:17,590
Well, I can't say.

00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:19,158
But what I can say

00:33:19,158 --> 00:33:21,327
is that you're going
to get through this.

00:33:21,327 --> 00:33:23,329
I hope so.

00:33:23,329 --> 00:33:24,530
For all our sakes.

00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:26,466
Yeah.
Sir...
MARK: Laura!

00:33:26,466 --> 00:33:27,600
Laura!

00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,068
Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:33:29,068 --> 00:33:30,403
I can't let
you in here.

00:33:30,403 --> 00:33:32,105
I have the right
to see my wife.

00:33:32,105 --> 00:33:33,973
McQUAID: Actually,
Mr. Gabriel, you don't.

00:33:33,973 --> 00:33:35,441
Mr. Gabriel, I'm gonna have
to ask you to stay out here.

00:33:35,441 --> 00:33:36,943
Get him the hell out of here.

00:33:36,943 --> 00:33:38,411
That's my wife!
She's a witness.

00:33:38,411 --> 00:33:39,979
And she's going
to bury you.

00:33:39,979 --> 00:33:41,881
No, you're the one
trying to bury me.

00:33:41,881 --> 00:33:43,516
Oh, if I was going to bury you,
I'd put you in the ground where

00:33:43,516 --> 00:33:46,352
they'd never find you.
Really? Is that a threat?

00:33:46,352 --> 00:33:48,287
Do you need help
finding the door?

00:33:48,287 --> 00:33:49,589
We're not done.

00:33:58,031 --> 00:34:00,033

Everything's going

00:34:04,103 --> 00:34:08,107
Thank you.

00:34:08,107 --> 00:34:09,342
She's scared.

00:34:09,342 --> 00:34:11,077
Yeah, well...

00:34:11,077 --> 00:34:13,012
she's got reason.

00:34:13,012 --> 00:34:14,113
Wish I could say it'll
go away with time,

00:34:14,113 --> 00:34:16,182
but I'd be lying.

00:34:18,584 --> 00:34:21,888
You can never completely
outrun your past.

00:34:26,125 --> 00:34:29,328
I'm never going
to see her again.

00:34:31,364 --> 00:34:32,565
What about you?

00:34:32,565 --> 00:34:36,469
Well, that's your call.

00:34:36,469 --> 00:34:37,870

00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:41,340
Transport team's here.

Don't worry...

00:34:43,042 --> 00:34:45,545

Laura said that the man

to kill Stanley Merrill,

00:35:42,902 --> 00:35:44,971
the man that she heard

Yeah, but they're

And their loyalty
is only to themselves.
Right.

00:35:51,377 --> 00:35:53,613
So, if we catch them,
maybe we can get them

00:35:53,613 --> 00:35:55,081
to flip on Gabriel.
Right.

00:38:28,067 --> 00:38:29,068
Right now.

00:38:29,068 --> 00:38:30,436
Walk away?!

00:38:30,436 --> 00:38:33,606
Yes, go to the office,
leave your notes on my desk,

00:38:33,606 --> 00:38:35,608
and then go home.

00:38:35,608 --> 00:38:38,411
Just like that?

00:38:38,411 --> 00:38:42,982
Yeah, just like that.

00:38:46,352 --> 00:38:49,221
Don't let her
drive herself.

Do you want me to come in?

00:40:01,394 --> 00:40:02,962
It's probably not a good idea.

00:40:05,464 --> 00:40:07,299
Well, if you need anything,
call me.

00:40:07,299 --> 00:40:08,434
Okay?

00:40:08,434 --> 00:40:10,269
(sighs)

00:40:10,269 --> 00:40:13,205
Thanks.

00:40:24,016 --> 00:40:25,484
You deserve more, Lou.
