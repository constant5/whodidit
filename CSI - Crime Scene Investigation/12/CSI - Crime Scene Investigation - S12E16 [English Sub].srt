00:00:01,461 --> 00:00:04,431
(thunder crashing,
wind whistling)

00:00:16,068 --> 00:00:18,103
What do you see
in the sky, Harper?

00:00:18,103 --> 00:00:19,905
Planets.

00:00:19,905 --> 00:00:21,940
The red one is Mars.

00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:25,611
The one with the rings around
is called Saturn.

00:00:25,611 --> 00:00:28,013
And the smallest one is Pluto.

00:00:28,013 --> 00:00:30,916
Oh, my little astronomer,
it's time to go to bed now.

00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:31,850
Okay.

00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:02,614
(thunder rumbles)

00:01:19,731 --> 00:01:21,667
(siren approaching)

00:01:26,538 --> 00:01:28,073
Okay, we have
a reported kidnapping.

00:01:28,073 --> 00:01:30,842
A five-year-old boy,
Harper Riordan.

00:01:30,842 --> 00:01:34,680
His nanny, Shelby Buress,
is also missing.

00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,381
What about the parents?

00:01:36,381 --> 00:01:37,849
Uh, parent. Single dad.

00:01:37,849 --> 00:01:39,618
A "T.C. Riordan."

00:01:39,618 --> 00:01:42,054
Said he was sleeping when
the nanny put the kid to bed.

00:01:42,054 --> 00:01:43,422
What time was that?

00:01:43,422 --> 00:01:44,856
Around 10:00.

00:01:44,856 --> 00:01:46,925
Woke up at 11:30,
went to check in on the boy.

00:01:46,925 --> 00:01:48,860
Did he make the 911 call?

00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,363
Yeah. 11:35.

00:01:51,363 --> 00:01:52,664
Half past midnight.

00:01:52,664 --> 00:01:54,933
Clock's got the
head start on us.

00:01:58,503 --> 00:01:59,838
Didn't you just say

00:01:59,838 --> 00:02:02,374
he was asleep at the
time of the abduction?

00:02:02,374 --> 00:02:04,109
Yeah.

00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:06,645
Is that how you
dress for bed?

00:02:06,645 --> 00:02:08,981
I dress a little less formally.

00:02:08,981 --> 00:02:11,083
Where's the boy's room?

00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:12,818
Upstairs.

00:02:25,797 --> 00:02:27,699
Okay, got some blood.

00:02:27,699 --> 00:02:30,035
Not a lot of it.
Definitely a struggle.

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,708
Blood's tacky.

00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:38,010
Consistent with
the dad's timeline.

00:02:42,614 --> 00:02:46,685
I got a print... in blood.

00:02:46,685 --> 00:02:48,420
Definitely not
a five-year-old's.

00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,555
Our kidnapper, maybe?

00:02:54,593 --> 00:02:55,727
(camera clicks)

00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:02,868
Morgan, yeah,
I'm sending you a print.

00:03:02,868 --> 00:03:03,869
I want you to run it.

00:03:03,869 --> 00:03:05,370
I'm on it.

00:03:09,007 --> 00:03:11,076
(thunder rumbles)

00:03:13,912 --> 00:03:15,814
Look at that.

00:03:15,814 --> 00:03:17,082
FINLAY:
Blood on the ceiling.

00:03:17,082 --> 00:03:19,751
No, Saturn's missing.

00:03:23,388 --> 00:03:24,823
Metal particles.

00:03:24,823 --> 00:03:26,525
Could be transfer
from the kidnapper.

00:03:29,561 --> 00:03:30,996
Okay, I gotta get that
back to the lab.

00:03:30,996 --> 00:03:33,098
Why don't you have Hodges
come pick it up?

00:03:33,098 --> 00:03:35,500
I need you here.

00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,668
Hey, evidence coming through!

00:03:36,668 --> 00:03:37,803
Hold the door!
Hold the door!

00:03:45,444 --> 00:03:46,745
What part
of "Hold the door"

00:03:46,745 --> 00:03:48,380
don't you understand?

00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,881
I understood
all of it.

00:03:59,891 --> 00:04:02,928
(thunder crashing,
power whirring off)

00:04:02,928 --> 00:04:05,397
(alarm buzzing)

00:04:09,134 --> 00:04:11,369
Oh, brother.

00:04:11,369 --> 00:04:12,471
Oh, that is not good.

00:04:12,471 --> 00:04:13,772
BRASS:
It's not.

00:04:13,772 --> 00:04:16,508
A storm blew out
three generating stations.

00:04:16,508 --> 00:04:17,976
Power is out
in half the state.

00:04:17,976 --> 00:04:19,144
They say for how long?

00:04:19,144 --> 00:04:21,413
Could be a while.

00:04:21,413 --> 00:04:22,948
God, we already
lost enough time.

00:04:22,948 --> 00:04:24,416
You know the rule.

00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:25,484
If we don't find this kid

00:04:25,484 --> 00:04:26,818
in three hours, he's dead.

00:04:26,818 --> 00:04:28,120
If the lights don't come
back on,

00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,388
we'll find the kid in the dark.

And check the freezers.

00:05:10,595 --> 00:05:13,365
If we melt evidence,
bad guys walk.

00:05:13,365 --> 00:05:14,966
And lock down the guns
in Ballistics.

00:05:14,966 --> 00:05:17,569
Generator, freezer, guns.

00:05:17,569 --> 00:05:18,570
Copy that.

00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:19,571
All right.

00:05:19,571 --> 00:05:21,106
FYI, AFIS is out.

00:05:21,106 --> 00:05:22,707
So is CODIS and IBIS.

00:05:22,707 --> 00:05:24,743
Basically, all the "IS'es"
are down.

00:05:24,743 --> 00:05:26,611
We're just gonna have
to get used to it.

00:05:26,611 --> 00:05:27,846
Until the lights
come back on,

00:05:27,846 --> 00:05:29,915
we might as well
be back in grad school.

00:05:29,915 --> 00:05:31,850
Remember your basic
chemistry.

00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:33,718
Use your head, use your hands.

00:05:33,718 --> 00:05:36,555
And these cell phone batteries,
they're our only lifeline,

00:05:36,555 --> 00:05:37,956
so let's not waste 'em.

00:05:37,956 --> 00:05:40,592
We got a missing boy
and a nanny in the wind

00:05:40,592 --> 00:05:41,860
and we don't have much time.

00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,595
Head and hands. Got it.

00:05:43,595 --> 00:05:44,963
I got another call.

00:05:44,963 --> 00:05:46,598
Yeah, what?

00:05:46,598 --> 00:05:48,834
Yeah, heard the whole city's
blacked-out.

00:05:48,834 --> 00:05:50,602
What is that noise?

00:05:50,602 --> 00:05:51,970
It's the sound of...

00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:53,572
It's the sound of fear
and futility.

00:05:53,572 --> 00:05:56,541
Hey! You break that case,
you own it.

00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:58,076
This thing won't budge.

00:05:58,076 --> 00:06:00,478
It's not an escape hatch
if you can't escape.

00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:01,513
Where are you?

00:06:01,513 --> 00:06:03,915
We're trapped in elevator hell.

00:06:03,915 --> 00:06:05,784
Who's "we"?

00:06:05,784 --> 00:06:07,819
Me and-and... Henry.

00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,989
I was on my way to the lab

00:06:10,989 --> 00:06:12,991
to process that metal trace
that you and Finn found,

00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,726
and, uh, well, let's just say

00:06:14,726 --> 00:06:16,428
it's gonna to have to wait
until help arrives.

00:06:16,428 --> 00:06:18,730
I'll get Morgan
call Maintenance.

00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:21,900
Yeah, um, she might dial
the phone a little faster

00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,902
if you omit the part
about me being in here.

00:06:23,902 --> 00:06:25,370
Just a thought.

00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:27,772
What are you guys,
in high school?

00:06:29,507 --> 00:06:30,909
(camera shutter clicks)

00:06:30,909 --> 00:06:32,978
Hey.
Hey.

00:06:32,978 --> 00:06:35,547
So, we got blood splatter
on the ceiling,

00:06:35,547 --> 00:06:36,948
spatter on the sheets,

00:06:36,948 --> 00:06:40,418
and we've got this white
residue here.

00:06:40,418 --> 00:06:41,753
Go ahead and bindle that.

00:06:41,753 --> 00:06:45,023
Yeah. That's gonna be
the easy part.

00:06:45,023 --> 00:06:47,359
You know, if this turns out
to be important evidence,

00:06:47,359 --> 00:06:48,760
who knows how long
it's gonna take

00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,629
before we can process it
and get an answer.

00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:51,663
I know, I know, I know.

00:06:53,865 --> 00:06:55,500
Okay...

00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,836
no ladder outside the window,

00:06:57,836 --> 00:06:59,638
no tree that someone
could climb up.

00:06:59,638 --> 00:07:02,641
Dust along the ledges doesn't
seem to be disturbed,

00:07:02,641 --> 00:07:06,645
so our...
our kidnapper was already

00:07:06,645 --> 00:07:09,414
inside the house.

00:07:09,414 --> 00:07:12,050
FINLAY:
Hey, look at this void.

00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:14,719
Blood pattern is interrupted
right down this line.

00:07:16,521 --> 00:07:18,523
What do you think,
rug?
Yeah.

00:07:18,523 --> 00:07:20,458
Maybe somebody took the rug
out of here

00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:21,893
with somebody inside of it.

00:07:21,893 --> 00:07:23,929
And if this blood
is the boy's,

00:07:23,929 --> 00:07:26,131
that means he put up a fight.

00:07:26,131 --> 00:07:27,465
And lost.

00:07:30,035 --> 00:07:32,671
And that would explain
why there is no blood

00:07:32,671 --> 00:07:34,572
trailing out of the door
or in the hallway

00:07:34,572 --> 00:07:35,974
or down the stairs.

00:07:35,974 --> 00:07:38,076
Yeah. Wait, wait, wait,
let's back up.

00:07:38,076 --> 00:07:40,712
We don't know for sure that this
is the boy's blood, right?

00:07:40,712 --> 00:07:42,380
It could be the nanny's.

00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,115
We can't run the DNA
until the power's back on.

00:07:44,115 --> 00:07:45,650
So what do we do?

00:07:47,686 --> 00:07:49,354
We go old school.

00:07:49,354 --> 00:07:51,356
ABO typing. I like that.

00:07:51,356 --> 00:07:52,590
See, that's why you're here.

00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:55,093
I'll call Greg.

00:07:55,093 --> 00:07:56,094
SIDLE:
Hey, Nick?

00:07:56,094 --> 00:07:57,829
Yeah, I'm back here.

00:07:57,829 --> 00:08:01,766
Checked all points of entry--
no sign of a break-in.

00:08:01,766 --> 00:08:04,569
We could be looking
at an inside job.

00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:06,037
STOKES:
They look happy in this photo.

00:08:06,037 --> 00:08:07,939
I wonder what happened
to the wife.

00:08:11,109 --> 00:08:13,111
This is some serious
candle power.

00:08:13,111 --> 00:08:14,579
I mean,
it looks like T.C. Riordan

00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:15,847
is used to being unplugged.

00:08:19,117 --> 00:08:21,586
Got blood drops
on the table here.

00:08:24,055 --> 00:08:25,957
And a couple more
on the floor, see?

00:08:25,957 --> 00:08:27,125
SIDLE:
Mm-hmm.

00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:29,461
You know,
could be the same

00:08:29,461 --> 00:08:30,862
source as the blood upstairs.

00:08:30,862 --> 00:08:32,497
The boy.

00:08:32,497 --> 00:08:33,765
STOKES:
Yeah.

00:08:33,765 --> 00:08:35,633
Spines suggest directionality.

00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:39,137
Heading for the door outside.

00:08:39,137 --> 00:08:41,473
Let's see where the trail goes.

00:08:41,473 --> 00:08:45,377
How long has Shelby Buress been
your son's nanny, Mr. Riordan?

00:08:45,377 --> 00:08:46,644
From the minute
Harper was born.

00:08:46,644 --> 00:08:47,846
Shelby didn't do this.

00:08:47,846 --> 00:08:49,714
You sound pretty sure of that.

00:08:49,714 --> 00:08:50,715
I am.

00:08:50,715 --> 00:08:52,017
This is a very
big house.

00:08:52,017 --> 00:08:54,019
You must have a lot
of people working for you.

00:08:54,019 --> 00:08:56,888
Yes.
And I trust all of them.

00:08:56,888 --> 00:08:58,023
I'm gonna need a list.

00:08:59,724 --> 00:09:01,626
Do you and your wife share
custody of your son?

00:09:01,626 --> 00:09:06,731
My wife... my wife passed away
five years ago.

00:09:06,731 --> 00:09:07,966
I'm sorry.

00:09:07,966 --> 00:09:10,635
And you said
that you were asleep

00:09:10,635 --> 00:09:12,370
when Harper went
missing.

00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:13,605
I fell asleep in the den.

00:09:13,605 --> 00:09:16,508
In a tux?

00:09:16,508 --> 00:09:19,377
I was planning on
going out tonight.

00:09:19,377 --> 00:09:20,745
I changed my mind.

00:09:20,745 --> 00:09:22,580
So what woke you up?

00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:25,083
Nothing. Why?

00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:26,618
You didn't hear anything?

00:09:26,618 --> 00:09:29,521
No. I just...

00:09:29,521 --> 00:09:31,489
I just woke up.

00:09:31,489 --> 00:09:33,825
Well, we're gonna have
to take your fingerprints.

00:09:33,825 --> 00:09:35,493
It's just
a standard procedure.

00:09:35,493 --> 00:09:38,396
You know, so we can
exclude yours from
the kidnapper.

00:09:38,396 --> 00:09:39,964
And we'll need a blood sample.

00:09:39,964 --> 00:09:41,733
Fine.

00:09:41,733 --> 00:09:43,368
One last question.

00:09:43,368 --> 00:09:45,637
What is your son's blood type?

00:09:45,637 --> 00:09:48,506
I don't know.
No, it's fine.

00:09:48,506 --> 00:09:51,743
Uh, did he cut himself,
scrape himself recently?

00:09:51,743 --> 00:09:53,011
Maybe a bloody nose?

00:09:53,011 --> 00:09:56,881
He cut his chin
just the other day.

00:09:56,881 --> 00:09:58,750
The Band-Aid might
still be in the garbage can.

00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:01,920
And how did that happen,
the cut on the chin?

00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,621
He fell.

00:10:07,892 --> 00:10:08,893
BRODY:
<i>The Palermo?</i>

00:10:08,893 --> 00:10:10,462
Seriously?

00:10:10,462 --> 00:10:12,931
Okay, when do you think
engineers can be here?

00:10:12,931 --> 00:10:15,400
Oh, okay, thanks.

00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,634
For nothing.

00:10:16,634 --> 00:10:18,103
Henry and Hodges still
in the elevator?

00:10:18,103 --> 00:10:19,637
Hodges is in there?

00:10:19,637 --> 00:10:21,606
Just focus on Henry.
And this.

00:10:21,606 --> 00:10:22,874
What is it?

00:10:22,874 --> 00:10:24,142
Residue from the
missing boy's room.

00:10:24,142 --> 00:10:25,410
Oh, Without the Mass Spec,

00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:26,611
what am I supposed
to do with it?

00:10:26,611 --> 00:10:28,413
I don't know.
Be creative.

00:10:28,413 --> 00:10:30,515
Russell has me doing
ABO blood typing.
Want to help?

00:10:30,515 --> 00:10:33,918
Sure. Tonight,
everything old is new.

00:10:37,589 --> 00:10:39,524
♪ ♪

00:11:00,945 --> 00:11:03,615
♪ ♪

00:11:29,941 --> 00:11:32,010
♪ ♪

00:12:01,005 --> 00:12:02,707
I got clumping.

00:12:02,707 --> 00:12:04,709
You?
Yeah.

00:12:04,709 --> 00:12:06,044
Based on the Band-Aid exemplar,

00:12:06,044 --> 00:12:09,781
the boy's blood
type is O.

00:12:10,882 --> 00:12:12,784
You sure about that?

00:12:12,784 --> 00:12:15,019
Yeah.

00:12:15,019 --> 00:12:16,521
Why?

00:12:16,521 --> 00:12:19,524
FINLAY: What are you
doing out here?

00:12:19,524 --> 00:12:22,594
What, are you, uh,
communing with the stars?

00:12:22,594 --> 00:12:24,963
My cell phone's communing
with a charger.

00:12:24,963 --> 00:12:26,764
So what's your take
on T.C. Riordan?

00:12:26,764 --> 00:12:28,766
Why? What's yours?
Wouldn't be
the first time

00:12:28,766 --> 00:12:30,635
that a parent tried
to cover up abuse

00:12:30,635 --> 00:12:33,404
with a phony kidnapping report.

00:12:33,404 --> 00:12:36,441
Yeah, but let's not get
too far ahead of ourselves.

00:12:36,441 --> 00:12:38,576
Kidnapper hasn't contacted
Riordan with any demands.

00:12:38,576 --> 00:12:39,577
I know.

00:12:39,577 --> 00:12:41,546
I just...

00:12:41,546 --> 00:12:44,716
have a feeling this case is not
going to follow the rules.

00:12:49,387 --> 00:12:51,489
STOKES:
Blood trail's gone cold.

00:12:51,489 --> 00:12:52,890
No drops since the house.

00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:54,559
Rain probably
washed them away.

00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:55,493
(thunder rumbling)

00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,031
SIDLE:
Hey, Galileo.

00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,399
Yeah.

00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:03,101
No blood,
but check it out-- 11:00.

00:13:09,674 --> 00:13:11,042
STOKES:
Saturn.

00:13:11,042 --> 00:13:14,012
Planet from
the boy's room.

00:13:14,012 --> 00:13:15,747
(sighs heavily)

00:13:17,682 --> 00:13:19,851
Nick... and the missing carpet.

00:13:24,822 --> 00:13:25,957
(camera shutter clicks)

00:13:25,957 --> 00:13:28,860
It's awfully convenient.

00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,628
It's like we were
meant to find him.

00:13:33,431 --> 00:13:35,466
(sighs)

00:13:39,837 --> 00:13:40,872
STOKES:
Whoa.

00:13:41,973 --> 00:13:43,574
It's Harper's nanny.

00:13:46,577 --> 00:13:48,680
STOKES:
Got a knife right here.

00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,149
And something else.

00:13:58,356 --> 00:14:00,124
"We have Harper."

00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,635
Till I can see what I'm doing,

00:14:10,635 --> 00:14:12,837
I'm going to have to hold off
on the autopsy.

00:14:12,837 --> 00:14:15,907
But my initial exam says
the missing boy's nanny

00:14:15,907 --> 00:14:19,677
suffered two sharp force
injuries to the chest

00:14:19,677 --> 00:14:21,713
and...

00:14:21,713 --> 00:14:24,382
two more
to the upper back,

00:14:24,382 --> 00:14:26,484
all from
a double-edged blade.

00:14:26,484 --> 00:14:28,686
SIDLE: That and the width
of the wounds

00:14:28,686 --> 00:14:30,722
looks consistent
with the knife that we found.

00:14:30,722 --> 00:14:31,823
(electrical buzz)

00:14:31,823 --> 00:14:33,558
Things just keep getting better.

00:14:33,558 --> 00:14:35,893
Someone ask
for a light?

00:14:35,893 --> 00:14:37,495
Yeah, a light.

00:14:37,495 --> 00:14:39,130
That looks like
a moonshine still.

00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:41,566
Actually,
it's a slightly different kind

00:14:41,566 --> 00:14:43,501
of white lightning.

00:14:43,501 --> 00:14:44,836
Behold...

00:15:04,622 --> 00:15:06,124
Not bad, huh?

00:15:06,124 --> 00:15:08,626
In college, I
found that R &amp; B,

00:15:08,626 --> 00:15:10,928
with just a little
chemiluminescence,

00:15:10,928 --> 00:15:12,764
really set the mood.

00:15:12,764 --> 00:15:14,766
I can see it.
I can't.

00:15:14,766 --> 00:15:15,867
What's in there
anyway?

00:15:15,867 --> 00:15:17,034
Luminol.

00:15:17,034 --> 00:15:19,637
With just a splash
of permanganate.

00:15:19,637 --> 00:15:21,139
Great job, Dave.

00:15:21,139 --> 00:15:22,774
It's nothing.

00:15:24,142 --> 00:15:25,810
What do you got, Doc?

00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:27,912
Could be
an abrasion to the lip.

00:15:27,912 --> 00:15:30,748
Doesn't look like
blunt force trauma.

00:15:30,748 --> 00:15:32,049
Pressure wound, maybe.

00:15:32,049 --> 00:15:33,785
Kidnapper
clamps a hand

00:15:33,785 --> 00:15:35,386
over her mouth to silence her.

00:15:35,386 --> 00:15:36,554
(muffled grunting)

00:15:42,727 --> 00:15:44,862
The boy wouldn't
have heard a thing.

00:15:44,862 --> 00:15:46,063
Suggests a sequence.

00:15:46,063 --> 00:15:47,799
Kill the nanny,
take the boy.

00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:49,801
And carry them both
out of the room.

00:15:49,801 --> 00:15:52,570
I think our kidnapper had help.

00:15:54,972 --> 00:15:56,808
Whoa. Watch out.
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

00:15:56,808 --> 00:15:59,477
This thing's already
killed someone.

00:15:59,477 --> 00:16:01,512
Oh. You'd just be putting me
out of my misery.

00:16:01,512 --> 00:16:03,681
Why? What's wrong?
That white residue
from the kid's bedroom--

00:16:03,681 --> 00:16:04,849
I was able to run

00:16:04,849 --> 00:16:06,150
all the standard color tests

00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:07,718
for an unknown white powder.

00:16:07,718 --> 00:16:09,487
Got zip, zero, nada.

00:16:09,487 --> 00:16:11,389
So it's a negative.

00:16:11,389 --> 00:16:12,723
No, I should have
gotten a result.

00:16:12,723 --> 00:16:14,091
Color tests cover 90%
of all narcotics.

00:16:14,091 --> 00:16:15,426
Narcotics?
Yeah.

00:16:15,426 --> 00:16:16,527
Nanny murdered,

00:16:16,527 --> 00:16:17,829
kid grabbed up.

00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:19,096
Dad says he
didn't hear anything.

00:16:19,096 --> 00:16:20,698
Kid could have been
sedated, right?

00:16:20,698 --> 00:16:21,899
Russell said

00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:23,534
use head and hands.

00:16:23,534 --> 00:16:24,869
I'm using my head.

00:16:24,869 --> 00:16:26,103
Hands not so good.

00:16:26,103 --> 00:16:28,105
Okay, well, maybe I have

00:16:28,105 --> 00:16:30,408
another thought
for your hands.

00:16:30,408 --> 00:16:33,778
A crystal test-- it might cover
the other ten percent.

00:16:33,778 --> 00:16:36,547
Without electricity
for the scopes?

00:16:42,487 --> 00:16:44,388
Forget old school.

00:16:44,388 --> 00:16:45,356
Go ancient.

00:16:49,093 --> 00:16:50,695
RUSSELL:
<i>How we doing</i>

00:16:50,695 --> 00:16:52,930
on the metal trace
from the boy's bedsheet?

00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:55,833
Um, we are still trapped
in the metal box.

00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,068
You remember
that, right?

00:16:57,068 --> 00:16:58,870
Didn't Morgan make that call?

00:16:58,870 --> 00:16:59,871
Yes.

00:16:59,871 --> 00:17:01,072
And, uh, apparently,

00:17:01,072 --> 00:17:02,707
the people who
could extricate us

00:17:02,707 --> 00:17:05,610
from our metal box are
themselves stuck in a metal box

00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:06,611
in the Palermo.

00:17:06,611 --> 00:17:07,945
I need that trace processed.

00:17:07,945 --> 00:17:09,747
If our kidnapper brought it
into that house,

00:17:09,747 --> 00:17:11,616
it may be our only way
to find him.

00:17:11,616 --> 00:17:13,150
So, if you can't
get yourself out of there,

00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:15,019
find a way
to get the evidence out.

00:17:15,019 --> 00:17:16,988
How are we supposed to do that?

00:17:16,988 --> 00:17:18,356
I don't know, Henry.

00:17:18,356 --> 00:17:19,557
Figure something out.

00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,694
Any more stupid questions?

00:17:23,694 --> 00:17:26,364
Do you have to go to
the bathroom as badly as I do?

00:17:27,665 --> 00:17:29,967
♪ ♪

00:17:57,094 --> 00:17:59,530
♪ ♪

00:18:03,034 --> 00:18:04,602
Awesome.

00:18:06,537 --> 00:18:08,906
BRODY: Nice call on
the crystal test.

00:18:08,906 --> 00:18:10,608
White substance from
the kid's bedroom

00:18:10,608 --> 00:18:12,376
screened positive
for ketamine.

00:18:12,376 --> 00:18:14,545
Used as a veterinary
anesthetic,

00:18:14,545 --> 00:18:16,914
but also as an
injectable pain med.

00:18:16,914 --> 00:18:18,482
One Sara found...

00:18:18,482 --> 00:18:20,685
in T.C. Riordan's
medicine cabinet.

00:18:20,685 --> 00:18:22,787
You were right--
the kid was doped.

00:18:22,787 --> 00:18:24,722
What'd you find
on the knife?

00:18:24,722 --> 00:18:26,791
ABO results indicate
two blood types.

00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:28,793
Blood type
on the blade is AB,

00:18:28,793 --> 00:18:30,895
which matches the nanny,
Shelby Buress.

00:18:30,895 --> 00:18:32,396
Fits with the rest
of the evidence.

00:18:32,396 --> 00:18:33,598
Blood on the handle

00:18:33,598 --> 00:18:34,865
is type O,

00:18:34,865 --> 00:18:37,468
which matches
T.C. Riordan.

00:18:38,536 --> 00:18:40,504
Location is everything.

00:18:40,504 --> 00:18:43,074
Suggests the father
was holding the knife.

00:18:43,074 --> 00:18:45,376
BRASS: So I called the
police department

00:18:45,376 --> 00:18:47,545
in your old hometown,
San Francisco.

00:18:47,545 --> 00:18:50,548
We were really just checking
on the nanny.

00:18:50,548 --> 00:18:54,485
But it turns out you're the
more interesting story.

00:18:54,485 --> 00:18:55,720
When you told us
that your wife

00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,689
passed away
five years ago,

00:18:58,689 --> 00:19:01,759
you neglected
to mention how.

00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:03,961
Very suspicious drowning
in your pool.

00:19:03,961 --> 00:19:06,530
What does this have to do
with finding my son?

00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:08,899
Well, Frisco PD thinks you
murdered your wife in a rage,

00:19:08,899 --> 00:19:11,636
and I think you did
the same thing to the nanny.

00:19:11,636 --> 00:19:12,637
And then you disposed

00:19:12,637 --> 00:19:15,139
of the only witness.

00:19:15,139 --> 00:19:16,140
We're not going to find

00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,109
your son alive,
are we?

00:19:18,109 --> 00:19:19,477
This kidnapping crap...

00:19:21,412 --> 00:19:22,980
...is just that. Right?

00:19:24,949 --> 00:19:26,450
I'm going to tell you
the same thing

00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:27,952
I told the cops
in San Francisco.

00:19:27,952 --> 00:19:29,553
I'm innocent.

00:19:29,553 --> 00:19:31,122
And I'm telling
the truth.

00:19:31,122 --> 00:19:33,591
BRASS: Yeah, but you're leaving
out some important facts.

00:19:33,591 --> 00:19:34,992
Like who Harper's
real mother is.

00:19:34,992 --> 00:19:36,060
Your nanny,

00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,362
Shelby Buress.

00:19:38,362 --> 00:19:39,997
RUSSELL: See, we, uh,
confirmed that

00:19:39,997 --> 00:19:41,766
with the hospital
in San Francisco.

00:19:41,766 --> 00:19:43,934
She is Harper's birth mother.

00:19:43,934 --> 00:19:45,369
BRASS: I mean,
it all adds up.

00:19:45,369 --> 00:19:46,904
Your wife found out
you knocked up Shelby.

00:19:46,904 --> 00:19:48,472
She wants a divorce,
she wants money,

00:19:48,472 --> 00:19:49,774
she ends up dead in your pool.

00:19:49,774 --> 00:19:51,008
Flash-forward

00:19:51,008 --> 00:19:52,743
to your mistress, Shelby,
who ends up dead

00:19:52,743 --> 00:19:54,078
in your backyard.

00:19:54,078 --> 00:19:55,446
You got a way with women, buddy.

00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:01,018
You ever see
this knife before?

00:20:04,722 --> 00:20:05,723
Yes. It's mine.

00:20:05,723 --> 00:20:07,391
It's in my house.

00:20:07,391 --> 00:20:09,393
How about it's in
Shelby Buress's back?

00:20:09,393 --> 00:20:11,595
RUSSELL: See, we found
her blood on the blade,

00:20:11,595 --> 00:20:15,433
but your blood on the handle.

00:20:15,433 --> 00:20:17,368
How do you explain that?

00:20:17,368 --> 00:20:18,736
That's my blood.

00:20:20,371 --> 00:20:22,139
But I didn't murder anyone.

00:20:25,643 --> 00:20:28,446
I was making an offering
to the dead.

00:20:31,449 --> 00:20:33,017
What?

00:20:33,017 --> 00:20:35,453
I opened my vein
during a séance.

00:20:37,455 --> 00:20:39,657
You do know that you're not
in San Francisco now.

00:20:39,657 --> 00:20:41,559
The knife was part
of the ritual.

00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:43,394
For my departed
Natalie.

00:20:43,394 --> 00:20:44,762
(thunder rumbling)

00:20:44,762 --> 00:20:47,665
I give you this gift
from life unto death.

00:20:56,807 --> 00:20:58,609
A séance?

00:21:00,544 --> 00:21:01,979
Okay.

00:21:01,979 --> 00:21:03,514
I'm all done here.

00:21:07,885 --> 00:21:09,153
(door closes)

00:21:09,153 --> 00:21:10,554
Okay.

00:21:10,554 --> 00:21:12,656
Who else was at the séance?

00:21:12,656 --> 00:21:13,791
Shelby,

00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:15,659
<i>my mother-in-law Patricia,</i>

00:21:15,659 --> 00:21:17,428
<i>and Karen, the medium.</i>

00:21:17,428 --> 00:21:19,930
Well, how... how come we're just
hearing about this now?

00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:21,966
Because I knew you'd jump
to the wrong conclusions,

00:21:21,966 --> 00:21:23,734
just like the cops
in San Francisco did.

00:21:23,734 --> 00:21:25,669
Well, it's a hell of a story,
isn't it?

00:21:25,669 --> 00:21:27,371
It's not a story;
it's the truth.

00:21:28,739 --> 00:21:29,974
I love my wife.

00:21:29,974 --> 00:21:31,675
I miss her.

00:21:31,675 --> 00:21:33,744
I brought together the people
who were closest to her

00:21:33,744 --> 00:21:37,081
to try to... make contact.

00:21:38,415 --> 00:21:39,984
And did you do that?

00:21:39,984 --> 00:21:41,852
Did you make contact?

00:21:45,956 --> 00:21:47,858
I'm not a murderer.

00:21:47,858 --> 00:21:51,395
I'm a father
who needs you to find my son.

00:22:06,577 --> 00:22:09,680
Boy's been missing for
over five hours now.

00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,049
If he's really
missing at all.

00:22:12,049 --> 00:22:14,852
You know, Brass seems to think
this whole thing is a hoax.

00:22:14,852 --> 00:22:16,353
That the father killed
the nanny

00:22:16,353 --> 00:22:18,622
and that the kid
was just collateral damage.

00:22:18,622 --> 00:22:20,591
Where are we at?
Got a good fingerprint

00:22:20,591 --> 00:22:21,892
on the kidnapper's
note here.

00:22:21,892 --> 00:22:23,561
All right, that
plus the headboard.

00:22:23,561 --> 00:22:25,095
If they are T.C.'s prints,

00:22:25,095 --> 00:22:27,131
Brass's theory is looking
pretty good.

00:22:27,131 --> 00:22:28,866
Yeah.

00:22:28,866 --> 00:22:31,035
Man, computers have really
spoiled me.

00:22:31,035 --> 00:22:32,970
It's been a while
since I've done this by eye.

00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:34,972
Uh-huh. Me, too.

00:22:34,972 --> 00:22:36,907
All right, tell you what,
you take the note.

00:22:36,907 --> 00:22:38,042
I'll take the headboard.

00:22:38,042 --> 00:22:40,377
Okay. There you go.

00:22:40,377 --> 00:22:41,445
Thanks.

00:22:44,114 --> 00:22:46,417
A plain arch.

00:22:46,417 --> 00:22:49,954
No, wait a minute.

00:22:49,954 --> 00:22:51,088
Got a tented arch here.

00:22:51,088 --> 00:22:52,857
That's pretty cool.

00:22:52,857 --> 00:22:56,894
I got the same thing here.
That's very rare.

00:22:56,894 --> 00:22:57,895
Good for us.

00:22:57,895 --> 00:22:59,930
Maybe bad for T.C.

00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:01,632
Let's check him out.

00:23:03,434 --> 00:23:05,903
Ulnar loops, radial loops...

00:23:05,903 --> 00:23:07,638
a few whorls.

00:23:07,638 --> 00:23:08,906
Interesting ridge pattern.

00:23:11,008 --> 00:23:13,110
It's a real smorgasbord, but...

00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:14,645
No tented arches.

00:23:16,013 --> 00:23:17,915
No.

00:23:17,915 --> 00:23:19,850
The prints we found on
the kidnapper's note

00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:22,019
and the boy's headboard
did not belong to T.C.

00:23:22,019 --> 00:23:23,954
And there were no prints
on the knife.

00:23:23,954 --> 00:23:26,357
So if the prints don't fit,
you must acquit? Bull.

00:23:26,357 --> 00:23:27,791
Yeah, I'm right there
with you.

00:23:27,791 --> 00:23:30,361
We've got Riordan's knife,
his drugs.

00:23:30,361 --> 00:23:32,496
I mean, I'm not saying that
he necessarily did it alone,

00:23:32,496 --> 00:23:34,565
but we know he's got plenty
of people working for him.

00:23:34,565 --> 00:23:36,100
Yeah, and we checked them
all out, though.

00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,935
But he's got the money
to buy their silence,

00:23:37,935 --> 00:23:39,370
maybe even their alibis.

00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:40,905
Yeah, you were in
the interrogation room.

00:23:40,905 --> 00:23:42,773
Didn't you feel
the presence of a con man,

00:23:42,773 --> 00:23:44,708
a lying sack of shinola?
The whole séance story?

00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:46,510
Yeah, it's far out.
I know that.

00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:48,412
I'm just saying, if the guy's
telling the truth,

00:23:48,412 --> 00:23:51,649
there's a shot that his boy
is still out there alive.

00:23:51,649 --> 00:23:53,417
Were you able to follow up
on his story?

00:23:53,417 --> 00:23:55,519
Oh, you mean was I able to
conjure up the mother-in-law

00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:58,389
and spirit guide?
No, I'm still working on it.

00:23:58,389 --> 00:24:00,424
We all know
how this is gonna end.

00:24:02,059 --> 00:24:03,794
BRASS:
Look, D.B.--

00:24:03,794 --> 00:24:06,931
are you thinking like
a dad here or a CSI?

00:24:06,931 --> 00:24:09,533
Call just came in.
Kidnapper.

00:24:11,402 --> 00:24:13,871
MAN:
Get yourself a pen and paper,
Mr. Riordan.

00:24:13,871 --> 00:24:15,973
Write this down.

00:24:20,077 --> 00:24:22,513
I need to know...

00:24:22,513 --> 00:24:24,415
is my son all right?

00:24:24,415 --> 00:24:27,551
Who's asking,
you or the cops?

00:24:29,586 --> 00:24:32,022
Me. I'm asking.

00:24:32,022 --> 00:24:33,390
HARPER:
Daddy?

00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:34,425
Harper.

00:24:34,425 --> 00:24:35,893
I'm scared.

00:24:35,893 --> 00:24:37,695
Hey, pal...

00:24:38,762 --> 00:24:42,800
Tell me something.

00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,802
Who lives on the Moon?

00:24:44,802 --> 00:24:47,404
The lady in white.

00:24:47,404 --> 00:24:49,506
That's right.

00:24:49,506 --> 00:24:51,709
Harper, are you okay?

00:24:51,709 --> 00:24:53,577
MAN: Palermo parking lot,
level three.

00:24:53,577 --> 00:24:55,112
All the jewels from the safe.

00:24:55,112 --> 00:24:56,847
8:00 a.m.

00:24:56,847 --> 00:24:58,382
Your contact will wear
a red hat.
(line beeps off)

00:24:58,382 --> 00:24:59,383
8:00 a.m.

00:24:59,383 --> 00:25:00,884
That gives us four hours.

00:25:07,891 --> 00:25:09,026
RUSSELL:
<i>So you keep over</i>

00:25:09,026 --> 00:25:10,995
$2 million
worth of jewelry

00:25:10,995 --> 00:25:12,363
in your house safe?

00:25:12,363 --> 00:25:13,697
Yes.

00:25:13,697 --> 00:25:16,500
Most of it belonged
to my wife Natalie.

00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,603
You couldn't think of a better
place to keep it?

00:25:19,603 --> 00:25:20,904
I like to keep her things near.

00:25:23,674 --> 00:25:26,744
There are some nights that...

00:25:26,744 --> 00:25:28,879
RUSSELL:
Okay, um...

00:25:28,879 --> 00:25:32,583
anyone else know
about Natalie's jewelry?

00:25:32,583 --> 00:25:33,751
My mother-in-law, Patricia.

00:25:34,918 --> 00:25:36,020
Patricia Lydecker.

00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,554
RUSSELL:
<i>You were at the séance</i>

00:25:37,554 --> 00:25:39,123
last night, is that
right, Mrs. Lydecker?

00:25:39,123 --> 00:25:40,491
Yes.

00:25:40,491 --> 00:25:41,792
What time did you
leave the house?

00:25:41,792 --> 00:25:42,993
Around 10:00.

00:25:42,993 --> 00:25:44,428
Before they took Harper.

00:25:44,428 --> 00:25:45,596
"They"?

00:25:45,596 --> 00:25:47,831
Well, I just assume

00:25:47,831 --> 00:25:50,634
there must have been
more than one person.

00:25:52,369 --> 00:25:53,704
Okay. Um,

00:25:53,704 --> 00:25:55,773
and you were aware
that T.C.

00:25:55,773 --> 00:25:57,975
still had possession
of your daughter's jewelry?

00:25:57,975 --> 00:26:01,378
Yes. Why do you ask?

00:26:01,378 --> 00:26:02,946
Just trying to, uh...
get the facts straight.

00:26:02,946 --> 00:26:04,848
And I'm also trying
to understand how

00:26:04,848 --> 00:26:08,652
a woman whose son-in-law
is suspected of murdering

00:26:08,652 --> 00:26:11,989
her daughter, how she
could still be so cozy

00:26:11,989 --> 00:26:13,624
with the alleged killer.

00:26:13,624 --> 00:26:17,027
See, we called the San
Francisco police department,

00:26:17,027 --> 00:26:19,897
and they told us that after they
dropped charges against T.C.,

00:26:19,897 --> 00:26:23,100
you actually brought a
wrongful death suit against him.

00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,501
Which I withdrew.

00:26:24,501 --> 00:26:26,570
Because you thought
you might lose?

00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:31,375
No, because I came to understand
that my son-in-law is innocent.

00:26:31,375 --> 00:26:34,611
Okay.

00:26:34,611 --> 00:26:35,646
How'd that happen?

00:26:35,646 --> 00:26:37,781
My daughter,
Natalie, told me.

00:26:37,781 --> 00:26:39,616
Natalie?

00:26:39,616 --> 00:26:41,952
Through Karen.

00:26:41,952 --> 00:26:43,654
<i>Karen has helped me,</i>

00:26:43,654 --> 00:26:47,825
<i>helped me to find peace.</i>

00:26:47,825 --> 00:26:50,727
So you've communicated
with Natalie?

00:26:50,727 --> 00:26:51,995
Yes.

00:26:51,995 --> 00:26:54,398
On several occasions
at T.C.'s house.

00:26:54,398 --> 00:26:57,868
Karen allows me
to understand what it is

00:26:57,868 --> 00:26:59,403
that Natalie wants.

00:26:59,403 --> 00:27:00,437
And what is that?

00:27:00,437 --> 00:27:02,639
Mr. Russell,

00:27:02,639 --> 00:27:05,442
grief put my husband
in an early grave.

00:27:05,442 --> 00:27:08,545
Were it not for Karen,
I might have joined him.

00:27:11,682 --> 00:27:13,784
T.C. came to me in grief.

00:27:13,784 --> 00:27:16,553
Said he was unable to accept
the death of Natalie.

00:27:16,553 --> 00:27:18,555
But peace comes

00:27:18,555 --> 00:27:21,859
not from the acceptance of
death, but from an understanding

00:27:21,859 --> 00:27:23,594
that death is
just the beginning.

00:27:25,429 --> 00:27:28,699
I sense a disturbance
in your chakras.

00:27:28,699 --> 00:27:29,967
Yeah, I get that a lot.

00:27:29,967 --> 00:27:31,068
What I want from you

00:27:31,068 --> 00:27:33,103
right now is
a straight answer.

00:27:33,103 --> 00:27:36,373
When did you leave
the Riordan house?

00:27:36,373 --> 00:27:37,741
A little after 10:00.

00:27:37,741 --> 00:27:39,810
After the communion
with Natalie.

00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:41,945
Mrs. Lydecker and I
shared a taxi.

00:27:41,945 --> 00:27:43,847
And Mr. Riordan went to bed?

00:27:43,847 --> 00:27:45,983
Oh, no. I doubt that.

00:27:45,983 --> 00:27:49,386
What do you mean?

00:27:49,386 --> 00:27:50,687
Look, if you know
something,

00:27:50,687 --> 00:27:51,889
it's in your best interest

00:27:51,889 --> 00:27:53,357
to play medium with me
right now.

00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:58,529
During the ceremony,
T.C. became agitated.

00:28:01,598 --> 00:28:03,567
Natalie wants to speak.

00:28:03,567 --> 00:28:04,868
What is it, my love?

00:28:09,573 --> 00:28:13,577
My love,
you have betrayed me again.

00:28:13,577 --> 00:28:17,748
You must let me go for your
sake, for the sake of Harper.

00:28:19,149 --> 00:28:21,618
Your grief is
not an act of love.

00:28:21,618 --> 00:28:23,487
It's an act
of selfishness.

00:28:28,392 --> 00:28:29,593
My husband was upset.

00:28:29,593 --> 00:28:31,795
He ended the
communion.

00:28:31,795 --> 00:28:32,930
Your husband?

00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:36,033
I mean T.C.
I'm sorry.

00:28:36,033 --> 00:28:38,368
Natalie's spirit force
is quite strong.

00:28:38,368 --> 00:28:42,039
I feel her presence now.

00:28:42,039 --> 00:28:43,974
Say hi for me.

00:28:43,974 --> 00:28:46,843
Let's get back to T.C.

00:28:46,843 --> 00:28:48,779
T.C told us all to leave.

00:28:48,779 --> 00:28:50,080
He was angry.

00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,982
The last I saw him,
he was in the den.

00:28:51,982 --> 00:28:54,518
When you say angry,
how angry was he?

00:28:54,518 --> 00:28:58,088
Natalie just wanted T.C.
to find peace.

00:28:58,088 --> 00:29:01,425
I'm afraid her words
had the opposite effect.

00:29:04,795 --> 00:29:06,597
HODGES: <i>Henry, I'm not sure</i>
<i>your brute force</i>

00:29:06,597 --> 00:29:07,598
<i>is gonna get this evidence</i>

00:29:07,598 --> 00:29:08,599
to the lab.

00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:09,600
You're doing in wrong.

00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,034
Really?

00:29:11,034 --> 00:29:14,137
'Cause you took
that elevator breakout class?

00:29:14,137 --> 00:29:15,505
(grunting)

00:29:15,505 --> 00:29:17,407
It's moving.
Okay, yeah.

00:29:17,407 --> 00:29:18,408
Come on.

00:29:18,408 --> 00:29:19,142
Come on.

00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:22,412
Aah!
(groans)

00:29:23,547 --> 00:29:24,881
(groans in pain)
Damn.

00:29:27,818 --> 00:29:29,019
What are you doing?

00:29:29,019 --> 00:29:30,721
Calling Russell,
admitting defeat.

00:29:30,721 --> 00:29:31,722
What?! No.

00:29:31,722 --> 00:29:32,923
Hey!

00:29:32,923 --> 00:29:34,758
No more stupid questions,
all right?

00:29:34,758 --> 00:29:36,593
We are CSIs.

00:29:36,593 --> 00:29:37,995
Well, sort of.

00:29:37,995 --> 00:29:39,029
Let's come up with answers.

00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:40,831
In here?

00:29:42,466 --> 00:29:43,600
We have your kit.

00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:48,438
You're right.

00:29:48,438 --> 00:29:50,607
We could do a spot test,

00:29:50,607 --> 00:29:52,509
identify the material,

00:29:52,509 --> 00:29:54,511
then maybe it'll tell
us where it came from.

00:29:54,511 --> 00:29:55,679
I've got potassium hydroxide

00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:56,847
in my kit.
Perfect.

00:30:01,585 --> 00:30:02,986
Oh, wow.

00:30:02,986 --> 00:30:04,755
That's all of it?
It's enough to test.

00:30:04,755 --> 00:30:06,556
Yeah, but the test consumes
the whole thing.

00:30:06,556 --> 00:30:08,425
If we're wrong,
there's no do-overs.

00:30:08,425 --> 00:30:11,128
If we're right,
we may save a boy's life.

00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:20,504
BRASS:
8:20.

00:30:20,504 --> 00:30:22,906
Red Hat is late.

00:30:22,906 --> 00:30:24,574
I knew this was bogus.

00:30:24,574 --> 00:30:25,942
I hope for the kid's sake
you're wrong.

00:30:28,945 --> 00:30:30,747
BRASS:
Look at this.

00:30:30,747 --> 00:30:31,948
That bastard has been here

00:30:31,948 --> 00:30:32,983
the whole time.

00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:41,758
What...

00:30:41,758 --> 00:30:43,060
What's he doing?
What's he doing now?

00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,728
You think the boy's in there?

00:30:44,728 --> 00:30:46,129
I don't know.
STOKES: I don't like this.

00:30:46,129 --> 00:30:47,664
Me, neither.

00:30:47,664 --> 00:30:48,765
Hold on.

00:30:48,765 --> 00:30:50,133
All units be advised,

00:30:50,133 --> 00:30:52,869
suspect is wearing a black
leather jacket, red hat.

00:30:52,869 --> 00:30:54,371
On the move.

00:30:54,371 --> 00:30:56,773
Gray van.
Do not engage, visuals only.

00:30:58,809 --> 00:31:00,143
What happened
to the rear window?

00:31:00,143 --> 00:31:01,712
What window?
There isn't any.

00:31:01,712 --> 00:31:03,413
Exactly.
Hey, where you going?

00:31:11,455 --> 00:31:13,623
STOKES: Somebody got
out of that van.

00:31:13,623 --> 00:31:14,725
Stop the van.

00:31:14,725 --> 00:31:16,126
Lock down
the parking structure.

00:31:16,126 --> 00:31:17,461
(siren whoops)

00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:22,366
Step out of the vehicle!
Hands on your head!

00:31:24,968 --> 00:31:26,470
Step away from the van.

00:31:28,138 --> 00:31:29,506
Put you hands
where I can see 'em!

00:31:39,649 --> 00:31:42,152
Van's clear.

00:31:42,152 --> 00:31:43,153
Where's the guy?

00:31:43,153 --> 00:31:44,554
I don't know.

00:31:44,554 --> 00:31:45,789
He told me to drive
to an address.

00:31:45,789 --> 00:31:47,090
He said I'd find Harper there.

00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:49,025
He said no cops,
no surprises.

00:31:49,025 --> 00:31:51,628
You people
just got my son killed.

00:31:51,628 --> 00:31:53,764
(gunshots)

00:31:53,764 --> 00:31:56,600
DISPATCHER:
<i>434, shots fired at the corner</i>
<i>of Altos and Fairway.</i>

00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,034
<i>Units responding.</i>

00:31:58,034 --> 00:31:59,970
(sirens wailing)

00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:15,685
Same jacket,
same face.

00:32:15,685 --> 00:32:17,421
It's Red Hat.

00:32:17,421 --> 00:32:19,723
Must have had an accomplice--
put two bullets in him.

00:32:19,723 --> 00:32:20,857
No Harper.

00:32:24,928 --> 00:32:27,364
Looks like somebody
forgot to get paid.

00:32:27,364 --> 00:32:28,999
Not good for the kid.

00:32:32,936 --> 00:32:35,405
SIDLE: Address the kidnapper
gave Riordan was bogus.

00:32:35,405 --> 00:32:37,107
Empty lot; no Harper.

00:32:37,107 --> 00:32:38,575
Red Hat's name
is Trevor Raymond.

00:32:38,575 --> 00:32:40,010
He's got a Henderson address,

00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:42,012
and he's got a nice set
of tented arches.

00:32:42,012 --> 00:32:44,815
His prints are the ones that we
found on headboard and the note.

00:32:44,815 --> 00:32:46,550
Which puts him
inside the house

00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:48,985
as well as outside,
dumping the nanny's body.

00:32:48,985 --> 00:32:50,654
Two bullets in Raymond
confirms our theory

00:32:50,654 --> 00:32:51,755
that he wasn't working alone.

00:32:51,755 --> 00:32:53,356
Yeah, and Trevor Raymond

00:32:53,356 --> 00:32:55,091
wasn't on T.C.'s list
of employees or staff.

00:32:55,091 --> 00:32:58,929
Okay, so if this is an inside
job, who's our insider?

00:32:58,929 --> 00:33:00,931
Nick and Brass are searching
Raymond's place now.

00:33:00,931 --> 00:33:02,766
Hopefully they'll find
a link to the accomplice.

00:33:02,766 --> 00:33:03,867
Forget the three-hour rule.

00:33:03,867 --> 00:33:05,101
We're into hour nine now.

00:33:05,101 --> 00:33:07,571
Yeah, but...
No, I'm saying, look,

00:33:07,571 --> 00:33:09,739
we've got a dead nanny,
now we've got a dead kidnapper.

00:33:09,739 --> 00:33:11,608
And the fact that
the accomplice panicked

00:33:11,608 --> 00:33:13,810
and left the loot behind,
the kid's got to be dead, too.

00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:17,047
How's that help us right now?

00:33:17,047 --> 00:33:18,548
SIDLE:
Well, actually, the guy

00:33:18,548 --> 00:33:19,883
didn't leave
all the loot behind.

00:33:19,883 --> 00:33:21,751
Morgan's got the last
iPad standing.

00:33:21,751 --> 00:33:23,119
Still has some juice.

00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:24,788
I was able to pull up
the inventory photos

00:33:24,788 --> 00:33:26,389
of the jewelry that we took

00:33:26,389 --> 00:33:27,991
before we made the exchange
with Red Hat.

00:33:27,991 --> 00:33:29,459
There is something missing.

00:33:29,459 --> 00:33:30,961
Let's take a look.

00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,668
Oh, yeah. Wedding ring.

00:33:38,668 --> 00:33:40,804
Well, from the size of it,
I'm guessing it's Natalie's.

00:33:40,804 --> 00:33:42,973
I'm guessing that the ring
isn't the only thing

00:33:42,973 --> 00:33:44,508
that belonged
to Natalie.

00:33:44,508 --> 00:33:45,909
Why? What do you got?

00:33:45,909 --> 00:33:47,911
I was adding
Trevor Raymond's blood type

00:33:47,911 --> 00:33:49,646
to our ABO findings,

00:33:49,646 --> 00:33:50,847
when I noticed something.

00:33:50,847 --> 00:33:53,817
Harper Riordan's
blood type is O.

00:33:53,817 --> 00:33:54,851
Yeah.

00:33:54,851 --> 00:33:55,852
Check out Shelby Buress's.

00:33:58,488 --> 00:33:59,656
"AB."

00:34:01,758 --> 00:34:03,660
Let's get a few things straight,
Mr. Riordan.

00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:06,730
First, your son Harper is really
your wife Natalie's son,

00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:08,632
isn't he?

00:34:08,632 --> 00:34:10,000
Shelby Buress's
blood type

00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,902
is not compatible with Harper.

00:34:11,902 --> 00:34:14,804
She may have given birth to him,
but she was not his mother.

00:34:14,804 --> 00:34:16,139
She was a surrogate.

00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:18,575
So there wasn't an affair,
was there?

00:34:18,575 --> 00:34:20,410
For five years,

00:34:20,410 --> 00:34:23,647
the world's thought I'm
a murderer and a philanderer.

00:34:23,647 --> 00:34:24,881
What happened between

00:34:24,881 --> 00:34:26,516
me, my wife and Shelby
and my family--

00:34:26,516 --> 00:34:28,118
that's my business
and no one else's.

00:34:28,118 --> 00:34:29,619
What do you mean,
what does it matter?

00:34:31,354 --> 00:34:33,723
$2 million worth of jewelry,
and the kidnapper

00:34:33,723 --> 00:34:35,091
takes this.

00:34:35,091 --> 00:34:36,560
A simple
wedding band.

00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,827
Your wife's ring.

00:34:37,827 --> 00:34:39,496
Why?
I don't know.

00:34:39,496 --> 00:34:41,464
No, you have to know.

00:34:41,464 --> 00:34:42,465
Look, T.C.,

00:34:42,465 --> 00:34:43,900
you have a choice here.

00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,869
You can either stay
shuttered up in your house

00:34:45,869 --> 00:34:47,871
with your ghosts,
feeling sorry for yourself

00:34:47,871 --> 00:34:50,440
or you can open the damn blinds.

00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,409
This ring is
important.

00:34:52,409 --> 00:34:55,679
It's important to you and to
the person who took your son.

00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,481
Now, come on.

00:34:58,481 --> 00:35:00,483
That ring is the reason
why Natalie's dead.

00:35:01,751 --> 00:35:03,053
We'd been at a party.

00:35:03,053 --> 00:35:04,521
(both yelling at once)

00:35:04,521 --> 00:35:05,789
<i>We were both drunk.</i>

00:35:06,923 --> 00:35:09,593
<i>We had a fight.</i>

00:35:09,593 --> 00:35:12,462
<i>Natalie took off her ring</i>
<i>and she threw it in the pool.</i>

00:35:12,462 --> 00:35:13,396
Go. Go!
Yes!

00:35:17,634 --> 00:35:19,669
Few hours later, we made up.

00:35:19,669 --> 00:35:24,608
She went to get
the ring back and...

00:35:24,608 --> 00:35:25,609
she was still drunk.

00:35:27,677 --> 00:35:30,146
<i>I didn't even hear her.</i>

00:35:33,617 --> 00:35:36,920
It was an accident.

00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,054
But the world blamed you.

00:35:38,054 --> 00:35:40,123
The world was right.

00:35:40,123 --> 00:35:42,525
It was my fault.

00:35:42,525 --> 00:35:43,827
W-What are
you gonna do?

00:35:43,827 --> 00:35:45,061
You gonna
make your son

00:35:45,061 --> 00:35:48,098
pay for your sins?

00:35:48,098 --> 00:35:52,902
You think someone took Harper
to punish me?

00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,842
My vote:
Natalie's mother Patricia.

00:35:58,842 --> 00:36:01,044
Yeah, but she claims that
she's forgiven T.C., so...

00:36:01,044 --> 00:36:02,679
(scoffs)
That's ridiculous.

00:36:02,679 --> 00:36:05,515
I would never forgive
somebody who killed my daughter.

00:36:05,515 --> 00:36:07,884
Yeah, but we know your
history with forgiveness,

00:36:07,884 --> 00:36:08,985
so that...
Oh, that's nice.

00:36:08,985 --> 00:36:10,120
No, I didn't
mean it,

00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,788
I didn't mean
it that way.

00:36:11,788 --> 00:36:13,690
Come on, now, stop
it, focus. Patricia.

00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:16,026
Okay, she was there that night.

00:36:16,026 --> 00:36:17,627
She was in the house.

00:36:17,627 --> 00:36:19,029
She knew about the jewelry.

00:36:19,029 --> 00:36:20,964
And maybe she knew about Harper.

00:36:20,964 --> 00:36:24,834
He was her daughter's son,
therefore her grandson.

00:36:24,834 --> 00:36:28,605
Who should be living with her
and not her daughter's murderer.

00:36:28,605 --> 00:36:29,873
Yes, it's a twofer.

00:36:29,873 --> 00:36:31,941
Get the boy, kill the nanny.

00:36:31,941 --> 00:36:34,878
And with T.C.'s history,
he becomes the obvious suspect.

00:36:34,878 --> 00:36:36,746
And maybe this time he
goes down for the crime.

00:36:36,746 --> 00:36:37,747
STOKES:
Hey.

00:36:37,747 --> 00:36:39,516
What do you got?

00:36:39,516 --> 00:36:41,751
Brass and I tossed Red Hat's
place pretty thoroughly.

00:36:41,751 --> 00:36:43,086
Somebody sent him ten G's.

00:36:43,086 --> 00:36:44,821
We found a receipt
for the wire transfer.

00:36:44,821 --> 00:36:46,356
So we got our accomplice.

00:36:46,356 --> 00:36:48,058
Depends if
you believe in ghosts or not.

00:36:48,058 --> 00:36:49,459
Check out the signature.

00:36:49,459 --> 00:36:51,928
Signed by the late
Natalie Riordan.

00:36:52,996 --> 00:36:55,465
(computers beep, whir)

00:36:55,465 --> 00:36:57,133
Okay, that's freaky.

00:36:57,133 --> 00:36:58,835
(elevator clicks, whirs)

00:36:58,835 --> 00:36:59,903
(gasps)

00:36:59,903 --> 00:37:01,905
Yes.

00:37:05,041 --> 00:37:06,910
(chuckles)

00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:09,379
CSIs.
CSIs.

00:37:09,379 --> 00:37:11,014
Well, sort of.

00:37:11,014 --> 00:37:12,949
So?

00:37:12,949 --> 00:37:13,983
Got it.

00:37:18,988 --> 00:37:21,958
Hodges and Henry were able
to I.D. that metal trace.

00:37:21,958 --> 00:37:23,827
It's a specific composite
of magnesium

00:37:23,827 --> 00:37:26,696
used primarily in
the production of mag wheels.

00:37:26,696 --> 00:37:29,099
Where do you find a mag
wheel factory in Las Vegas?

00:37:29,099 --> 00:37:30,767
Well, there's
only one,

00:37:30,767 --> 00:37:32,502
and luckily for us,
it's across the street

00:37:32,502 --> 00:37:33,970
from the wire
transfer office

00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:35,572
where the ghost
of Natalie Riordan

00:37:35,572 --> 00:37:38,007
sent money to Trevor Raymond.

00:37:38,007 --> 00:37:39,809
Northeast Las Vegas.

00:37:39,809 --> 00:37:42,045
A lot of abandoned buildings and
homes in that part of town.

00:37:42,045 --> 00:37:44,013
If I was looking for
a kidnapper's lair,

00:37:44,013 --> 00:37:45,548
that's where I'd go.

00:37:45,548 --> 00:37:47,517
Boy, that's a lot of
territory to cover.

00:37:47,517 --> 00:37:49,919
Maybe I can help narrow
down the canvass.

00:37:49,919 --> 00:37:51,354
What do you got?

00:37:51,354 --> 00:37:52,922
A line on our ghost.

00:37:52,922 --> 00:37:55,725
She used a fake I.D.
to make the wire transfer.

00:37:56,793 --> 00:37:59,829
Karen Chavera.

00:38:03,066 --> 00:38:05,101
Our ghost is
the ghost whisperer.

00:38:07,036 --> 00:38:08,471
Karen Chavera!

00:38:09,739 --> 00:38:11,007
LVPD!

00:38:12,542 --> 00:38:14,444
SIDLE: Guess we know
how Karen met Trevor.

00:38:16,946 --> 00:38:18,882
Clear. No lady, no kid.

00:38:18,882 --> 00:38:20,884
Same here.
But you gotta see this.

00:38:29,859 --> 00:38:32,729
Whoa.

00:38:32,729 --> 00:38:35,031
SIDLE:
That is some crazy wallpaper.

00:38:35,031 --> 00:38:36,800
STOKES: It's a shrine
to T.C. and Natalie.

00:38:38,935 --> 00:38:40,703
Looks like
our medium's research

00:38:40,703 --> 00:38:42,839
turned into a bit of
an obsession, don't you think?

00:38:47,844 --> 00:38:50,380
SIDLE: Yeah. She helped herself
to Natalie's things.

00:38:52,849 --> 00:38:54,150
And to T.C.'s meds.

00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,855
"Dear T.C.,

00:38:58,855 --> 00:39:00,957
"By the time you read this,
Harper and I will be gone.

00:39:00,957 --> 00:39:02,392
"I thought
we could be together,

00:39:02,392 --> 00:39:03,726
"but again you rejected me,

00:39:03,726 --> 00:39:05,995
"gave your love away
to Shelby, even Karen,

00:39:05,995 --> 00:39:07,730
"who reunited us.

00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:09,899
"You left me no choice
but to take them away from you.

00:39:09,899 --> 00:39:11,434
Now, you feel my pain."

00:39:11,434 --> 00:39:14,037
It's signed Natalie.

00:39:14,037 --> 00:39:17,440
I think that she became
Natalie Riordan.

00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,578
<i>Problem is, Karen thought T.C.</i>
<i>had an affair with Shelby.</i>

00:39:21,578 --> 00:39:23,947
<i>So when Karen became Natalie,</i>

00:39:23,947 --> 00:39:25,715
<i>she took revenge</i>
<i>on the one woman</i>

00:39:25,715 --> 00:39:27,450
<i>she blamed for</i>
<i>stealing T.C. away.</i>

00:39:31,588 --> 00:39:32,722
And then she took her kid.

00:39:41,564 --> 00:39:44,434
(thumping in distance)

00:39:50,974 --> 00:39:52,876
(thumping continues)

00:39:52,876 --> 00:39:54,577
That hutch is
blocking a door.

00:39:54,577 --> 00:39:56,079
Let's move it.

00:40:04,687 --> 00:40:05,889
There he is.
Hey, bud.

00:40:05,889 --> 00:40:07,423
SIDLE:
Harper.

00:40:07,423 --> 00:40:09,025
It's okay.
It's all right, all right?

00:40:09,025 --> 00:40:11,127
We're with the police.
Everything's going to be okay.

00:40:11,127 --> 00:40:12,629
Russell, it's Stokes.

00:40:12,629 --> 00:40:13,630
We found Harper,

00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:14,964
alive and well.

00:40:14,964 --> 00:40:16,499
No sign of Karen, though.

00:40:16,499 --> 00:40:17,734
RUSSELL:
Yeah, I know.

00:40:17,734 --> 00:40:20,570
I've got eyes on her right now.

00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:24,474
I guess she felt she
had to... join Natalie.

00:40:32,482 --> 00:40:33,983
Let's bring the boy on home.

00:40:43,726 --> 00:40:45,628
(chuckles)

00:40:45,628 --> 00:40:47,931
It's good to have all the
"IS'es" back, isn't it?

00:40:47,931 --> 00:40:50,066
It's good to have
everything back.

00:40:59,542 --> 00:41:01,811
You, uh, sure about that?

00:41:01,811 --> 00:41:05,415
You never know when it
might come in handy.

00:41:05,415 --> 00:41:06,449
Hmm.

00:41:06,449 --> 00:41:08,084
Why go old school...

00:41:08,084 --> 00:41:10,820
When you can go ancient.

00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:11,821
(chuckles softly)

00:41:11,821 --> 00:41:13,489
Hmm.

00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,695
(car door shuts)

00:41:27,971 --> 00:41:30,540
♪ ♪

00:41:39,849 --> 00:41:42,452
(mouthing)

00:41:43,853 --> 00:41:45,688
No three-hour rule on this one.

00:41:45,688 --> 00:41:46,823
Nope.

00:41:46,823 --> 00:41:48,524
Glad none of the rules applied.

00:41:51,561 --> 00:41:53,029
How do you do it?

00:41:53,029 --> 00:41:54,030
Do what?

00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:55,698
Never lose faith.

00:41:57,734 --> 00:41:59,502
Some things I hide
better than you do.
