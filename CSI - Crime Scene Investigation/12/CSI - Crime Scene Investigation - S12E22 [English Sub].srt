00:00:05,022 --> 00:00:07,991
That's it?

00:00:07,991 --> 00:00:09,960
(chuckles): All right,
I'll take it from here.

00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,228
Okay, Grandpa.
Okay.

00:00:11,228 --> 00:00:13,030
Time for bed, Katie.

00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:15,732
Mommy, I'm not tired.
Boy, I am.

00:00:15,732 --> 00:00:17,734
You need to listen
to your mommy, Kaitlyn.

00:00:17,734 --> 00:00:20,971
We're gonna have
lots of fun while you're here.

00:00:20,971 --> 00:00:22,439
So you got to get
lots of rest.

00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,208
And that goes
for your grandpa, too.

00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:25,409
What? Yes.

00:00:25,409 --> 00:00:27,444
Yes, definitely.

00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:29,480
Grandma's the boss;
you know that.

00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,714
And we're gonna have
so much fun,

00:00:30,714 --> 00:00:32,616
we're gonna go
to the lake,

00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:34,284
we're gonna see puppets,
we're gonna go to the museums.

00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:35,486
Ice cream?

00:00:35,486 --> 00:00:37,287
Ice cream, yes.
Tons of ice cream.

00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:38,622
Thanks, Dad.

00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:40,257
Emergency numbers
are on the fridge.

00:00:40,257 --> 00:00:41,492
And we're not gonna
be that late.

00:00:41,492 --> 00:00:42,693
Okay.
Right?

00:00:42,693 --> 00:00:44,695
Right.

00:00:44,695 --> 00:00:48,165
MAN:
<i>I came to this town</i>
<i>with five bucks in my pocket</i>

00:00:48,165 --> 00:00:50,000
and big dreams.

00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,469
Las Vegas was different
back then.

00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:56,473
It was all about the hustle,
all about scoring and moving on.

00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:59,443
And some guys did that.
But me...

00:00:59,443 --> 00:01:03,080
I planted my roots
right here in the desert.

00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,349
I got married, had kids,

00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:06,617
got married again...

00:01:06,617 --> 00:01:09,052
(laughter)

00:01:09,052 --> 00:01:11,722
Olivia, Conrad,
I-I didn't know you guys were...

00:01:11,722 --> 00:01:13,257
No, Olivia and I...

00:01:13,257 --> 00:01:14,458
we're just friends.

00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:15,659
Good friends.
Right.

00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,060
Like us.

00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,362
Not quite.
More champagne?

00:01:18,362 --> 00:01:19,596
Yes. Mother?

00:01:19,596 --> 00:01:22,332
Nice to see you,

00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:23,600
Barbara.

00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,536
You, too. I know
you're usually his date

00:01:25,536 --> 00:01:26,737
at these functions.

00:01:26,737 --> 00:01:28,172
Yeah,

00:01:28,172 --> 00:01:29,673
but people started to talk.

00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:32,609
Well, uh, so much for
the Russell family mantra, huh?

00:01:32,609 --> 00:01:35,245
Separation of
home and work?
Well, no, it's still in effect.

00:01:35,245 --> 00:01:36,713
I'm pretending I'm not here.

00:01:36,713 --> 00:01:38,382
MAN:
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:01:38,382 --> 00:01:40,384
I give you my good friend,

00:01:40,384 --> 00:01:44,321
the current and future
Sheriff of Las Vegas,

00:01:44,321 --> 00:01:46,089
Sheriff Liston!

00:01:49,092 --> 00:01:50,494
Didn't like the speech?

00:01:50,494 --> 00:01:52,296
No, guy giving it.

00:01:52,296 --> 00:01:55,065
Gilmore loves playing
the "self-made man."

00:01:55,065 --> 00:01:57,167
Truth is, he started
his empire running
a sports book

00:01:57,167 --> 00:01:58,969
for "made men."

00:01:58,969 --> 00:02:01,138
RUSSELL: Well, it looks like
he cleaned up his act, then?

00:02:01,138 --> 00:02:02,606
So he says.

00:02:02,606 --> 00:02:04,241
Undersheriff, it's good
to see you here tonight.

00:02:04,241 --> 00:02:05,509
You remember

00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:07,144
David Winnock, my
money man, right?

00:02:07,144 --> 00:02:08,412
Putting together
fundraising

00:02:08,412 --> 00:02:10,147
for the Vegas Silver
Strikes' new arena.

00:02:10,147 --> 00:02:11,748
GILMORE:
Oh, yeah. What can
I say, you know?

00:02:11,748 --> 00:02:13,750
Ex-hockey player;
I love my hockey team.
Well,

00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,386
that project's not approved yet,
Jack, you know that.

00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:19,189
Yeah, well, the city has
their time line, I got mine.

00:02:19,189 --> 00:02:20,390
Speaking of which,

00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,992
I see Councilman Romano.

00:02:21,992 --> 00:02:24,995
Hey, enjoy the
free drinks, guys.

00:02:24,995 --> 00:02:26,363
WOMAN:
Since I took office

00:02:26,363 --> 00:02:28,232
four years ago,

00:02:28,232 --> 00:02:30,734
crime in Las Vegas is down!

00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:33,570
Allow me to share
a few stats with you.

00:02:35,138 --> 00:02:38,141
<i>In the past four years...</i>

00:02:38,141 --> 00:02:42,412
(applause)
<i>prostitution is down by 32%.</i>

00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:45,015
<i>Drug offenses--</i>

00:02:45,015 --> 00:02:48,518
<i>all are down by more than 40%!</i>

00:02:48,518 --> 00:02:50,420
<i>In the past four years,</i>

00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,690
<i>murder down 28%.</i>

00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:57,361
<i>Assault down 35%.</i>

00:02:57,361 --> 00:02:58,562
<i>Rape down 48%.</i>

00:02:58,562 --> 00:02:59,963
(screams)

00:02:59,963 --> 00:03:01,431
<i>The numbers are good,</i>

00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,166
<i>but they can be better.</i>

00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:05,269
I ask you all tonight...

00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:07,971
for yourselves,
for your families,

00:03:07,971 --> 00:03:09,673
for Las Vegas,

00:03:09,673 --> 00:03:12,276
give me four more years!

00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:13,610
(applause)

00:03:16,747 --> 00:03:18,515
RUSSELL:
That was fun.
Let's do that again

00:03:18,515 --> 00:03:20,083
in about four years.
Oh... (laughs)

00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:21,251
(beeping)

00:03:21,251 --> 00:03:23,086
I got a text.

00:03:23,086 --> 00:03:24,488
From Maya.

00:03:24,488 --> 00:03:26,490
Aw, Katie's not asleep.

00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:28,659
She's waiting for her
grandpa to come home.
Aw...

00:03:28,659 --> 00:03:30,360
Let's not disappoint her.

00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,561
Hey.

00:03:31,561 --> 00:03:33,330
What happened to
the Hodges clan?

00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,365
I sent them home.
But our night's not over yet.

00:03:35,365 --> 00:03:36,600
What do you mean?

00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,201
We got a situation.

00:03:38,201 --> 00:03:39,436
Triple.

00:03:39,436 --> 00:03:41,505
I'll explain to Katie.

00:03:41,505 --> 00:03:43,373
All right, let's roll.

00:03:43,373 --> 00:03:45,609
Actually, we walk. Crime
scene's just down the alley.

00:03:45,609 --> 00:03:47,678
Hey. I'm sorry.

00:03:47,678 --> 00:03:49,279
(whispers):
It's okay.

00:03:52,749 --> 00:03:54,718
Detective Moreno.

00:03:54,718 --> 00:03:57,354
Undersheriff. You know
my partner, Mike Crenshaw.

00:03:57,354 --> 00:03:58,689
Undersheriff.

00:03:58,689 --> 00:04:00,457
Care to tell CSI's
Russell and Brody

00:04:00,457 --> 00:04:02,426
what you told me?
Uh, Mike and I

00:04:02,426 --> 00:04:04,328
have been working
undercover, a drug op.

00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:07,264
Our target is a dealer
named Donny Price.

00:04:07,264 --> 00:04:09,733
Small-time hood,
big-time scumbag.
Not anymore.

00:04:09,733 --> 00:04:11,468
We had a buy
set up here tonight.

00:04:11,468 --> 00:04:13,337
Found him and his bodyguard
shot in the head.

00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:14,671
Yeah, the
girlfriend's
dead, too.

00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,340
Drugs and cash gone.

00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:19,309
Sounds like
a textbook drug rip-off.
I agree.

00:04:19,309 --> 00:04:21,378
What-what's the situation?

00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:39,229
This is our situation.

00:04:39,229 --> 00:04:41,098
Who is she?

00:04:41,098 --> 00:04:43,533
ECKLIE:
Veronica Gilmore.

00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,235
Jack Gilmore's wife.

00:04:45,235 --> 00:04:47,637
As in... our friend of
the sheriff, Jack Gilmore?

00:04:47,637 --> 00:04:49,139
Yep.

00:04:51,241 --> 00:04:52,476
Whoa.

00:04:53,977 --> 00:04:57,414
So much for statistics.

00:05:04,321 --> 00:05:07,023

00:05:07,023 --> 00:05:10,127

Nice dress.

00:05:41,057 --> 00:05:43,160
(laughs)
Yeah? Thanks.

00:05:44,494 --> 00:05:46,363
Got an I.D. on the bodyguard.

00:05:46,363 --> 00:05:48,432
Alonso Seal.

00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:51,001
Doesn't like he was
much of a bodyguard.

00:05:51,001 --> 00:05:53,537
BRODY:
Couldn't even get his gun out.

00:05:53,537 --> 00:05:55,539
No sign of forced entry.

00:05:55,539 --> 00:05:57,340
Suggests he knew the gunman.

00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,476
STOKES:
And it looks like
Mr. Price here got caught

00:05:59,476 --> 00:06:00,677
with his pants down.

00:06:00,677 --> 00:06:02,078
Beat in the kneecap

00:06:02,078 --> 00:06:04,281
before he was
put out of his misery.

00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:05,515
Working theory:

00:06:05,515 --> 00:06:07,317
our bad guy

00:06:07,317 --> 00:06:09,419
steals the drugs...

00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:11,521
makes a break
for the door.

00:06:11,521 --> 00:06:13,457
Shoe impressions are indistinct.

00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:15,058
There's no discernable

00:06:15,058 --> 00:06:16,560
tread pattern.

00:06:19,196 --> 00:06:21,231
Hey.

00:06:21,231 --> 00:06:23,700
Come over here and
take a look at this.

00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,670
What do you see?

00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:29,339
BRODY:
Impressions end at the doorway,
but he didn't track

00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:30,540
any blood outside.

00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,741
The guy was
wearing booties.

00:06:31,741 --> 00:06:33,577
Just like us.

00:06:33,577 --> 00:06:35,378
Suggests planning,
premeditation.

00:06:35,378 --> 00:06:37,314
Mm-hmm.

00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:39,149
You know, the one thing

00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:41,618
I don't think he
planned for...
What's that?

00:06:41,618 --> 00:06:43,553
Eyewitness in the bathroom.

00:06:43,553 --> 00:06:45,055
(camera shutter clicks)

00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,229
What can you tell me?

00:06:52,229 --> 00:06:54,431
I've never seen
anything like this.

00:06:54,431 --> 00:06:55,732
I can't get a liver temp.

00:06:55,732 --> 00:06:58,101
Fin, I can't
even find her liver.

00:06:58,101 --> 00:07:00,470
That's really weird.
Yeah.

00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:03,740
You know, for a drug rip-off,
somebody went

00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,642
to an awful lot of trouble
to silence her.

00:07:05,642 --> 00:07:07,077
I mean, they could've

00:07:07,077 --> 00:07:08,979
just shot her,
like the other two.

00:07:14,117 --> 00:07:17,053
Last call went out at 9:07

00:07:17,053 --> 00:07:18,722
to her husband,

00:07:18,722 --> 00:07:20,123
Jack Gilmore.

00:07:20,123 --> 00:07:21,658
Lasted four seconds.

00:07:22,993 --> 00:07:24,561
GILMORE:
<i>I met Veronica</i>

00:07:24,561 --> 00:07:27,631
when I was, uh...
going through my divorce.

00:07:27,631 --> 00:07:31,501
It was a low point
in my life, and she...

00:07:31,501 --> 00:07:33,370
she saved me.

00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,005
Even back then,
she, uh...

00:07:35,005 --> 00:07:38,341
was drinking a little too much,

00:07:38,341 --> 00:07:40,076
partied too hard.

00:07:40,076 --> 00:07:42,646
So I've just spent
the last year trying to...

00:07:42,646 --> 00:07:44,981
trying to save <i>her.</i>

00:07:44,981 --> 00:07:46,683
So you knew that
your wife was...

00:07:46,683 --> 00:07:48,985
having an affair
with Donny Price?

00:07:48,985 --> 00:07:50,987
She left about four months ago.

00:07:50,987 --> 00:07:52,489
Shacking up with the guy.

00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:57,294
It's hard for me
to even say, you know.

00:07:57,294 --> 00:07:59,029
Jack, I'm so sorry.

00:07:59,029 --> 00:08:01,031
One more question.
When was the last time

00:08:01,031 --> 00:08:04,401
you spoke to your wife?
I don't know, it was
at least a week ago.

00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:06,703
Uh, minus seven days.

00:08:06,703 --> 00:08:08,405
Apparently, Mr.
Gilmore's wife

00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:11,241
called him tonight, around
the same time that she died.

00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:14,010
RUSSELL:
Mr. Gilmore, CSI Finlay.

00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,712
Couldn't have been
much of a conversation.

00:08:15,712 --> 00:08:17,447
It lasted about four seconds.

00:08:17,447 --> 00:08:19,316
That's 'cause there
wasn't any conversation.

00:08:19,316 --> 00:08:22,118
My wife had
the unfortunate habit
of drunk-dialing me

00:08:22,118 --> 00:08:24,287
and hanging up.
Assuming that
it was your wife

00:08:24,287 --> 00:08:27,324
and not someone calling
to tell you that she was dead.

00:08:27,324 --> 00:08:29,292
Excuse me?
Finlay, you're out of line.

00:08:29,292 --> 00:08:30,493
Let's clear it up right now.

00:08:30,493 --> 00:08:31,695
No need to get a warrant.

00:08:31,695 --> 00:08:33,330
Let's look at your phone.

00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:35,699
Am I a suspect?
RUSSELL: No,
sir, you're not.

00:08:35,699 --> 00:08:37,634
No, we're still just
gathering information.

00:08:37,634 --> 00:08:39,469
I'm sure you'll...
you'll work with us

00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:41,204
when the time comes.

00:08:41,204 --> 00:08:43,073
Let's get you
a ride home.

00:08:45,141 --> 00:08:47,344
Always the politician.

00:08:47,344 --> 00:08:49,479
Boy, you never learn, do you?

00:08:49,479 --> 00:08:51,081
Really.

00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:56,553
Looks like a nine-mil.

00:08:56,553 --> 00:08:58,455
Same as the others.

00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:01,658
ROBBINS:
And the stippling indicates
close-range shots.

00:09:01,658 --> 00:09:06,162
Mr. Price... sustained an
additional GSW to his knee.

00:09:06,162 --> 00:09:07,697
Skull fracture suggests

00:09:07,697 --> 00:09:09,466
he was beaten
with a blunt object,

00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:10,967
like a pistol.

00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,736
Somebody enjoyed their work.
Even more so

00:09:12,736 --> 00:09:14,471
with our female victim.

00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:18,041
C.O.D. is massive
internal hemorrhaging.

00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:20,610
Now I know why David
couldn't get liver temp.

00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,345
Looks like soup.

00:09:22,345 --> 00:09:24,381
She was hit
so hard and so often,

00:09:24,381 --> 00:09:26,082
her internal organs
disintegrated.

00:09:26,082 --> 00:09:28,585
I did find

00:09:28,585 --> 00:09:30,320
a fleck embedded
in her skin.

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,356
Appears to be some
sort of synthetic.

00:09:33,356 --> 00:09:35,692
SIDLE:
We'll get it to Hodges.
We'll see if

00:09:35,692 --> 00:09:37,594
we can identify the weapon.

00:09:37,594 --> 00:09:39,429
The undersheriff is
a friend of mine,

00:09:39,429 --> 00:09:42,065
and I like him, and I
like that you like him.

00:09:42,065 --> 00:09:43,433
In fact,

00:09:43,433 --> 00:09:46,336
I'm so glad about that
that I think you and he

00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:49,105
should go on a date
by yourselves.
(whispers): Oh, yeah.

00:09:49,105 --> 00:09:51,107
Uh, Mother, Mother,
I... Hello?

00:09:51,107 --> 00:09:52,676
I can't... I'm losing you.

00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:55,979
Yes. I-I'll call you back.

00:09:55,979 --> 00:09:57,514
(exhales)
Any news on
the fleck?

00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:59,182
It's a work in progress.

00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:01,384
Oh, yeah, well, text me
when you got something.

00:10:01,384 --> 00:10:03,019
Hey, um...

00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,255
how are you doing
with this whole my-mom-

00:10:05,255 --> 00:10:07,524
your-dad thing?
I mean,

00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:09,726
who knew when we had the
"Meet the Parents" dinner

00:10:09,726 --> 00:10:12,128
that our parents
would actually meet?

00:10:12,128 --> 00:10:15,031
Let's just hope they don't drag
us on any more dates with them.

00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,533
Or a wedding.
I mean...

00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:18,501
these things keep up,
and we could end up

00:10:18,501 --> 00:10:20,637
as some sort of Bizarro
<i>Brady Bunch</i> brother and sister.

00:10:20,637 --> 00:10:22,038
Maybe we should start dating

00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,339
and throw a wrench
into the works.

00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:26,176
I-I can't.
I was joking.

00:10:27,243 --> 00:10:29,112
But why can't you?

00:10:29,112 --> 00:10:31,014
Let's just say...

00:10:31,014 --> 00:10:34,684
that my trip to Italy
was life-changing.

00:10:34,684 --> 00:10:38,488
(beeping)
Ah. The fleck has spoken.

00:10:38,488 --> 00:10:41,424
Doc was right--
it is synthetic.

00:10:41,424 --> 00:10:44,227
Polyparaphenylene
terephthalamide.

00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:46,262
Kevlar combined with
aluminum and carbon.

00:10:46,262 --> 00:10:48,264
RUSSELL:
Sounds like an aluminum bat.

00:10:48,264 --> 00:10:50,533
Very... old-school, like the
<i>Goodfellas</i> or something.

00:10:50,533 --> 00:10:53,636
Yeah, guy walks into
a drug den and takes
care of business.

00:10:53,636 --> 00:10:56,005
Pops the first two guys,
silences the witness.

00:10:56,005 --> 00:10:57,507
He did more
than silence her.

00:10:57,507 --> 00:10:59,509
Autopsy shows that
Veronica Gilmore sustained

00:10:59,509 --> 00:11:01,644
more than 50 blows
to her head and body.

00:11:01,644 --> 00:11:04,414
Look, I know you think
that Jack Gilmore's
behind this, but...

00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:06,382
No, no, I don't think
he's behind it.

00:11:06,382 --> 00:11:07,617
I think he did it.

00:11:07,617 --> 00:11:09,519
Oh, come on, whoa,
stop, listen to me.

00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,121
Boy, you don't learn, do you?

00:11:11,121 --> 00:11:12,355
What?

00:11:12,355 --> 00:11:13,957
Let's not repeat history here.

00:11:13,957 --> 00:11:15,725
Please.
I'm not talking about history.

00:11:15,725 --> 00:11:17,527
I am talking about this case.

00:11:17,527 --> 00:11:18,995
So am I.

00:11:18,995 --> 00:11:21,131
FINLAY:
Good. It is no coincidence

00:11:21,131 --> 00:11:24,100
that Jack Gilmore's wife
was murdered at that motel.

00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,602
Okay, all right, all right.

00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:28,037
I will give you
that the guy might have

00:11:28,037 --> 00:11:31,508
hired somebody to kill his wife,
but he was not at that motel.

00:11:31,508 --> 00:11:33,209
No, no, he was at the
fund-raiser, right?

00:11:33,209 --> 00:11:34,577
RUSSELL:
Where every major figure

00:11:34,577 --> 00:11:37,447
in Vegas law enforcement
was present.

00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:39,582
They all saw him.
<i>I</i> saw him.

00:11:39,582 --> 00:11:41,651
You only think you saw him.

00:11:43,153 --> 00:11:44,454

Jack Gilmore
in the alley between

00:11:46,422 --> 00:11:48,191
the casino where the
fund-raiser was held,

00:11:48,191 --> 00:11:50,160
and the motel where
his wife was found.
9:07.

00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,395
That's right around
the time of the murders.

00:11:52,395 --> 00:11:55,598
Two minutes after he gave
the podium to the sheriff.

00:11:55,598 --> 00:11:58,201
Did you get all this
from his phone records?

00:11:58,201 --> 00:12:01,137
Yeah, I did, and I
got a warrant from
Brass. Don't worry.

00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:04,040
I also got the sheriff's speech,
and I timed it.

00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,608
18 minutes and six seconds.

00:12:05,608 --> 00:12:07,310
Plenty of time to slip away.

00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:11,347
I saw Gilmore at that reception
right after the speech.

00:12:11,347 --> 00:12:14,117
Not a hair on his
head was out of place.
FINLAY: Mm.

00:12:14,117 --> 00:12:16,319
So you really think

00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:18,254
that he could commit
three gruesome murders

00:12:18,254 --> 00:12:20,023
in an 18-minute time span.

00:12:20,023 --> 00:12:22,725
Get in, get out,
get back to the party.

00:12:22,725 --> 00:12:24,394
Well, you know,
there's only way

00:12:24,394 --> 00:12:26,262
to figure out
if that's even possible.

00:12:26,262 --> 00:12:28,464
Yeah, you guys need
to take a walk.

to the kitchen to
the loading dock.

00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:36,005
Killer's moving
at a deliberate pace,

00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,374
but doesn't want
to attract any attention.

00:12:38,374 --> 00:12:40,710
Yeah. He's taking his own
sweet time, just like us.

00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:42,512
What's that supposed to mean?

00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:45,448
Well, I think it's a good
idea that we take a walk,

00:12:45,448 --> 00:12:47,250
but shouldn't somebody
be putting pressure

00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,018
on Jack Gilmore,
like, right now?

00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:51,487
Hey, I'm down, but do you think
D.B.'s gonna go for it?

00:12:51,487 --> 00:12:53,456
No way.
So,

00:12:53,456 --> 00:12:55,592
tell me, what is the deal
with you two?

00:12:55,592 --> 00:12:59,062
What is all this, "don't repeat
history" stuff about anyway?

00:12:59,062 --> 00:13:01,364
Well, you know that he
fired me in Seattle.

00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:03,633
Really? I heard
he asked for your resignation.

00:13:03,633 --> 00:13:06,169
(laughing):
Yeah. What's the difference?

00:13:06,169 --> 00:13:07,570
Yeah, well, what's the story?

00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,672
Well, there was this
girl, Janet Warren.

00:13:09,672 --> 00:13:11,474
Mm-hmm.

00:13:11,474 --> 00:13:13,676
And she worked for this really
powerful venture capital,

00:13:13,676 --> 00:13:15,111
Tom Cooley.

00:13:15,111 --> 00:13:17,247
He was a real
son of a bitch.

00:13:17,247 --> 00:13:18,681
And one day, she
went missing.

00:13:18,681 --> 00:13:21,017
We never found her.

00:13:21,017 --> 00:13:23,253
I had hair,
carpet fibers and semen,

00:13:23,253 --> 00:13:25,989
and all I needed
was Cooley's DNA.

00:13:25,989 --> 00:13:27,657
And what, you couldn't get it?

00:13:27,657 --> 00:13:30,026
Oh, I got it.
I just couldn't test it.

00:13:30,026 --> 00:13:31,227
Oh, why not?

00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,029
Oh, some BS technicality.

00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:35,732
It was really that Cooley had
very powerful friends, and

00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:37,133
they protected him.

00:13:37,133 --> 00:13:38,334
And Russell?
Russell.

00:13:38,334 --> 00:13:39,535
Russell was Russell.

00:13:39,535 --> 00:13:40,737
Huh.

00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,138
What was his sage advice?

00:13:42,138 --> 00:13:43,339
Oh.

Mm.

00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,420
It's a composite shaft
of a hockey stick.

00:15:38,488 --> 00:15:40,323
(sighs)

00:15:40,323 --> 00:15:43,960
With the logo, Las Vegas
Silver Strikes on it.

00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,163
Same logo on the warm-up.

00:15:47,163 --> 00:15:48,631
The Silver Strikes

00:15:48,631 --> 00:15:50,633
are Gilmore's hockey team.

00:15:50,633 --> 00:15:53,269
Hope he's got a good defense.

00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:03,246
GILMORE:
Let's go! Keep it
on the edge, guys.

00:16:03,246 --> 00:16:05,248
Take us to the net.

00:16:05,248 --> 00:16:06,749
Come on, keep it moving.

00:16:08,251 --> 00:16:09,419
(grunt)
Man-to-man!

00:16:09,419 --> 00:16:10,620
You're supposed

00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,355
to be playing zone,
fellas. Come on!

00:16:12,355 --> 00:16:15,258
BRASS:
Looks like somebody
needs a time-out.

00:16:15,258 --> 00:16:17,260
Our practices are closed
to the public.

00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,528
Oh, we're not
the public.

00:16:18,528 --> 00:16:21,397
We have a warrant
to search the arena.

00:16:25,501 --> 00:16:28,137
I get the picture now.

00:16:28,137 --> 00:16:29,539
This is harassment!

00:16:29,539 --> 00:16:31,507
This is crap.
The scope of the warrant

00:16:31,507 --> 00:16:33,109
is for the arena.

00:16:33,109 --> 00:16:34,310
What about Gilmore's office?

00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:36,145
His car?
His home?

00:16:36,145 --> 00:16:38,181
Well, we're getting there.
One step at a time, Finn.

00:16:38,181 --> 00:16:40,249
Yeah, I'd say
that was good advice.

00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:42,085
We need his DNA,
because we cannot

00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:44,654
tie him to the warm-ups
without an exemplar.

00:16:44,654 --> 00:16:47,223
Jack Gilmore is still
just a person of interest here.

00:16:47,223 --> 00:16:49,125
He is not a suspect yet.

00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:51,594
Friends with benefits.

00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:53,429
I'm gonna pretend
I didn't hear that.

00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,565
I know what
you did in Seattle.

00:16:55,565 --> 00:16:57,600
Walked into a black-tie event,
walked out

00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,570
with Tom Cooley's
champagne glass in your purse,

00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:03,539
illegally obtaining
his DNA evidence.

00:17:03,539 --> 00:17:05,108
I think you need
to remind your CSI

00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:06,576
that that's not how
we do things here.

00:17:06,576 --> 00:17:08,311
Oh, I think she heard you.

00:17:13,049 --> 00:17:14,484
(Stokes sighs)

00:17:14,484 --> 00:17:16,385
Kevlar,

00:17:16,385 --> 00:17:19,122
aluminum and
carbon fiber.

00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:20,690
Looks like
our murder weapon.
Yeah.

00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:23,159
It's the wrong
brand, though.

00:17:23,159 --> 00:17:25,394
All these players have
the same type of duffel,

00:17:25,394 --> 00:17:28,030
same team warm-ups.
Yeah.

00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:30,533
Our killer did
his shopping here.

00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:36,739
Reb-2.

00:17:36,739 --> 00:17:39,175
Now, we're talking.

00:17:41,577 --> 00:17:44,614
Ooh. Hold that for a second.

00:17:45,748 --> 00:17:47,316
There's an extra blade in here.

00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,452
But the stick you found

00:17:49,452 --> 00:17:51,554
in the Dumpster was
missing a blade, right?

00:17:51,554 --> 00:17:53,289
Was it broken off?
No.

00:17:53,289 --> 00:17:54,657
It wasn't broken
off, actually.

00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:56,659
It was removed.

00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:59,228
See, these aren't your Papa
Olaf's sticks we're talking

00:17:59,228 --> 00:18:00,730
about here, buddy.

00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:02,598
Like everything else,
hockey's gone hi-tech.

00:18:02,598 --> 00:18:05,001
<i>Sticks are composite now.</i>

00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:07,336
<i>Blades can be switched</i>
<i>on and off pretty easily.</i>

00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:10,006
We found scratches
inside the throat

00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:11,474
of the stick
our killer used.

00:18:11,474 --> 00:18:14,110
Check it out.

00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:17,313
Now, is it just me, or do those
markings look very similar?

00:18:17,313 --> 00:18:18,514
Whose locker is that from?

00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:21,350
Peter Gagne.

00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,086
BRASS:
Gagne's been benched
a few times before.

00:18:24,086 --> 00:18:25,421
He's got a rap sheet.

00:18:25,421 --> 00:18:26,622
Assault, gambling debts.

00:18:26,622 --> 00:18:28,124
But also an alibi.

00:18:28,124 --> 00:18:29,392
Oh, yeah?
What's that?

00:18:29,392 --> 00:18:31,227
Dinner with the wife and kids.

00:18:31,227 --> 00:18:34,230
Okay, how does he explain his
stick ending up a murder weapon?

00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:36,332
Now that's an interesting story.

00:18:36,332 --> 00:18:39,202
The equipment manager
for the team is Dominic Bruno.

00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:40,970
Now, why does that
name sound familiar?

00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:42,471
Well, he was a leg-breaker
for Lou Gedda

00:18:42,471 --> 00:18:44,006
back in the day
when Jack Gilmore

00:18:44,006 --> 00:18:46,676
was more friendly
with the mob than the sheriff.

00:18:46,676 --> 00:18:49,979
You know, if Gilmore
is such a changed man,

00:18:49,979 --> 00:18:52,081
why's he have a guy
like Bruno on the payroll?

00:18:52,081 --> 00:18:53,282
MAN:
<i>I figured</i>

00:18:53,282 --> 00:18:54,483
you'd be showing up

00:18:54,483 --> 00:18:55,685
on my door sooner or later.

00:18:55,685 --> 00:18:57,053
I'd prefer sooner.

00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:59,121
But I'm a patient man, Dominic.

00:18:59,121 --> 00:19:01,524
And guys like you are always
making the same mistakes.

00:19:01,524 --> 00:19:03,659
Same could be said for you.

00:19:03,659 --> 00:19:05,127
I heard about
the boss's wife.

00:19:05,127 --> 00:19:07,363
'Course you probably think

00:19:07,363 --> 00:19:09,365
I had something to do with it?

00:19:09,365 --> 00:19:11,400
You know, you took the words
right out of my mouth.

00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,402
And the evidence
right out of that locker.

00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,037
You're losing your touch, Dom.

00:19:15,037 --> 00:19:17,073
It's not your style.

00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:18,574
Trying to pin it

00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:21,010
on a down-on-his-luck
hockey player with obligations.

00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:23,346
I had nothing to do with it,
and I can prove it.

00:19:23,346 --> 00:19:24,547
Oh, yeah?

00:19:24,547 --> 00:19:26,515
How you going to do that?

00:19:26,515 --> 00:19:28,951
Oh, like I said,
I figured I'd be seeing you,

00:19:28,951 --> 00:19:30,987
so, a few months back,
I recorded a conversation.

00:19:30,987 --> 00:19:35,291
See, you're not the only
one that came around here

00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:37,159
looking for the old Dom.

00:19:37,159 --> 00:19:38,628
GILMORE:
Hey, Dom. It's Jack.

00:19:38,628 --> 00:19:40,529
You give some thought
to our last conversation?

00:19:40,529 --> 00:19:43,699
BRUNO:
<i>Yeah, boss, I did, and</i>

00:19:43,699 --> 00:19:46,168
<i>I don't think you're going</i>
<i>to like the answer.</i>

00:19:46,168 --> 00:19:48,037
JACK:
<i>Come on, Dom. You owe me.</i>

00:19:48,037 --> 00:19:49,672
<i>When you got out of the joint</i>

00:19:49,672 --> 00:19:51,274
<i>and couldn't get a job,</i>

00:19:51,274 --> 00:19:53,175
<i>I was the only one</i>
<i>who hooked you up.</i>

00:19:53,175 --> 00:19:56,012
<i>I took you in</i>
<i>when all of our old friends</i>

00:19:56,012 --> 00:19:58,447
<i>had turned their backs on you.</i>

00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,683
<i>You said someday</i>
<i>you'd repay me.</i>

00:20:00,683 --> 00:20:03,653
<i>If I ever needed anything,</i>
<i>anything, you'd be there.</i>

00:20:03,653 --> 00:20:07,423
<i>Scumbags like Donny Price</i>
<i>deserve to die.</i>

00:20:07,423 --> 00:20:10,192
<i>So, I'm asking you,</i>
<i>I'm begging you,</i>

00:20:10,192 --> 00:20:12,194
<i>do this for me.</i>

00:20:12,194 --> 00:20:14,563
BRUNO:
<i>Boss, uh,</i>

00:20:14,563 --> 00:20:17,566
that guy you knew
before I went in the joint--

00:20:17,566 --> 00:20:20,569
I'm not the same guy anymore.

00:20:20,569 --> 00:20:22,405
I've changed.

00:20:22,405 --> 00:20:26,575
JACK:
You're not leaving me a lot
of options, Dom.

00:20:26,575 --> 00:20:28,344
I think this is the place

00:20:28,344 --> 00:20:31,113
where you lean over
and give your client a little

00:20:31,113 --> 00:20:32,348
whisper in the ear there.

00:20:32,348 --> 00:20:33,716
I can do my own
talking, thanks.

00:20:33,716 --> 00:20:35,184
Yeah, we heard.

00:20:37,219 --> 00:20:40,323
All right, look,
I reached out to Dom, okay?

00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:41,957
But that's all I did.

00:20:41,957 --> 00:20:43,959
He and I go a
long way back.

00:20:43,959 --> 00:20:45,461
Yeah, we know.
All your old pals,

00:20:45,461 --> 00:20:48,331
like Gedda and McKeen,
are all either dead or in jail.

00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:50,433
Yeah, and there's a reason
I'm neither.

00:20:50,433 --> 00:20:52,101
Look...

00:20:52,101 --> 00:20:55,204
I loved my wife,
and I wanted to protect her.

00:20:55,204 --> 00:20:58,207
But when Dom said, "Hey,
I'm not that guy anymore,"

00:20:58,207 --> 00:20:59,475
I realized that
I wasn't, either.

00:20:59,475 --> 00:21:00,976
No, I think you realize

00:21:00,976 --> 00:21:02,244
that now's the time
you were gonna

00:21:02,244 --> 00:21:03,579
take matters in your own hands.

00:21:03,579 --> 00:21:05,648
RUSSELL:
The evidence is kind of
stacking up.

00:21:05,648 --> 00:21:09,085
Hockey stick swiped from the
locker of one of your players.

00:21:09,085 --> 00:21:12,088
Team warm-ups with your wife's

00:21:12,088 --> 00:21:15,491
DNA on the outside,
your DNA on the inside.

00:21:15,491 --> 00:21:17,526
Also on the inside is

00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:21,063
a little black thread,
which I'm pretty sure will match

00:21:21,063 --> 00:21:23,032
your tuxedo.

00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:25,201
See, I think you planned
this whole thing four months ago

00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:27,336
when your wife, Veronica,
left you for her drug dealer.

00:21:27,336 --> 00:21:29,205
You planned it right down
to the perfect alibi.

00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:31,407
When all of Las Vegas
law enforcement

00:21:31,407 --> 00:21:33,242
was at a party passing the hat
for the sheriff.

00:21:33,242 --> 00:21:34,977
(door opens)

00:21:34,977 --> 00:21:36,245
FINLAY:
Sorry to interrupt.

00:21:36,245 --> 00:21:38,147
I have a
question for you.

00:21:38,147 --> 00:21:40,683
Oh, I thought maybe you
could use a fresh cup.

00:21:42,985 --> 00:21:45,488
Your, uh, cell phone

00:21:45,488 --> 00:21:47,156
put you in the alley.

00:21:47,156 --> 00:21:49,125
What exactly
were you doing there?

00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:51,293
If you weren't on
your way to the motel

00:21:51,293 --> 00:21:53,262
to kill your wife?

00:21:53,262 --> 00:21:54,597
I was meeting a guy.

00:21:54,597 --> 00:21:55,998
BRASS:
A guy?

00:21:55,998 --> 00:21:57,199
That's the best you can do?

00:21:57,199 --> 00:21:58,667
(laughs)

00:21:58,667 --> 00:22:01,570
His name's Bobby Connor, okay?

00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:04,473
He's a labor consultant,
works for Turlington, L.L.P.

00:22:04,473 --> 00:22:06,342
Usually, we meet
at Al's Diner.

00:22:06,342 --> 00:22:09,412
He's, um, helping me out with
the soccer arena project.

00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:11,680
So, this Bobby Connor
can vouch for you?

00:22:12,681 --> 00:22:14,216
(sighs)

00:22:14,216 --> 00:22:16,118
Actually, he never showed up.

00:22:16,118 --> 00:22:17,353
Oh, gee,

00:22:17,353 --> 00:22:19,088
that's not good.

00:22:20,389 --> 00:22:21,590
I checked on his alibi.

00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,992
There's no Bobby Connor.

00:22:22,992 --> 00:22:25,027
There's not consulting firm,

00:22:25,027 --> 00:22:26,262
Turlington, L.L.P.

00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:28,597
Looks like
your boy's going down.

00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,433
And it looks like CSI Finlay
was right.

00:22:32,067 --> 00:22:33,702
Thought you'd be
a little happier about this.

00:22:33,702 --> 00:22:36,071
Is there a butcher shop nearby?

00:22:36,071 --> 00:22:37,440
I think there's one

00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,275
over in the mini-mall
on Spring Mountain.

00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:41,177
Great. Thanks.

00:23:02,264 --> 00:23:04,133
Batter up.

00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:28,657
We've got soup.

00:23:30,459 --> 00:23:32,027
What's that?

00:23:32,027 --> 00:23:33,462
That's liver soup.

00:23:33,462 --> 00:23:36,065
Macerated like
Veronica Gilmore's organs.

00:23:36,065 --> 00:23:37,466
He didn't do it.

00:23:37,466 --> 00:23:39,568
That took me 54 blows
and all of my strength

00:23:39,568 --> 00:23:42,037
to make that soup happen.

00:23:42,037 --> 00:23:43,739
Well, how's this let Gilmore
off the hook?

00:23:43,739 --> 00:23:46,408
I mean, he's a big guy, right?
Ex-hockey player.

00:23:46,408 --> 00:23:48,210
Who now has ALS.

00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:49,712
Whoa.

00:23:49,712 --> 00:23:51,113
He's been keeping it hidden.

00:23:51,113 --> 00:23:52,548
His lawyers were very happy

00:23:52,548 --> 00:23:54,049
to turn over his
medical records,

00:23:54,049 --> 00:23:56,952
which say that he
has lost over 40%

00:23:56,952 --> 00:23:58,153
of his upper-body strength.

00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:02,658
Which is why
you brought him coffee.

00:24:02,658 --> 00:24:05,461
Yeah, he couldn't even lift
his arms beyond his shoulders.

00:24:05,461 --> 00:24:06,996
Remember, he used two hands

00:24:06,996 --> 00:24:08,531
to carry the cup.

00:24:08,531 --> 00:24:10,099
I do.

00:24:10,099 --> 00:24:11,700
All right, wait, whoa,
wait a second here.

00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,102
Wh-What about the evidence?

00:24:13,102 --> 00:24:16,071
We have his DNA on the warm-ups.

00:24:16,071 --> 00:24:17,640
The killer must
have stolen them,

00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,742
because Gilmore's got an
open locker at the arena

00:24:19,742 --> 00:24:21,377
like everybody else.

00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:24,113
Okay, what about the tuxedo
thread that Hodges found?

00:24:24,113 --> 00:24:25,714
He ran it.

00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:28,417
It does not match Gilmore's
tuxedo or any tuxedo.

00:24:28,417 --> 00:24:30,519
The thread is nylon

00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:32,187
with traces of neoprene.

00:24:32,187 --> 00:24:33,389
Neoprene.

00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:34,957
Like a wetsuit.
Yeah,

00:24:34,957 --> 00:24:36,525
a protective shield

00:24:36,525 --> 00:24:39,528
<i>that our killer wore</i>
<i>under the warm-ups</i>

00:24:39,528 --> 00:24:41,497
<i>to preserve Gilmore's DNA</i>

00:24:41,497 --> 00:24:43,966
<i>and only Gilmore's DNA</i>

00:24:43,966 --> 00:24:46,702
<i>while he was committing</i>
<i>the crimes.</i>

00:24:46,702 --> 00:24:49,972
So, if you think about it,
you've got the hockey stick,

00:24:49,972 --> 00:24:52,408
the warm-ups, the phone call
from his wife's phone

00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:54,143
to Gilmore in the alley,

00:24:54,143 --> 00:24:57,012
while he's waiting for
the mysterious stranger.

00:24:57,012 --> 00:24:58,714
The whole thing was a frame-up.

00:24:58,714 --> 00:25:00,416
So,

00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:03,586
if Gilmore's not our killer,
then who is?

00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:05,621
And why set him up?

00:25:09,725 --> 00:25:11,527
KAITLYN: Grandpa,
when are you coming home?

00:25:11,527 --> 00:25:12,728
Grandma and I made cookies.

00:25:12,728 --> 00:25:14,964
Want to see?

00:25:14,964 --> 00:25:16,498
BARBARA:
Oatmeal raisin, your favorite.

00:25:16,498 --> 00:25:18,267
Oh, wow.

00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:20,035
Tell me you can resist these.

00:25:22,471 --> 00:25:25,541
Uh, something tells me
desert's gonna have to wait?

00:25:25,541 --> 00:25:27,042
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

00:25:27,042 --> 00:25:29,078
I'll try to get home
by dinner time.

00:25:29,078 --> 00:25:31,046
Don't worry,
you do what you have to do.

00:25:31,046 --> 00:25:32,448
Right?
Yes.

00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:34,450
Mwah. We'll see you soon.

00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,051
Bye, Dad.

00:25:36,051 --> 00:25:37,386
(chuckles)

00:25:37,386 --> 00:25:39,121
Saturday night was fun.

00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:41,190
It was really fun.

00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:43,025
I didn't even hear you leave.
You didn't.

00:25:43,025 --> 00:25:45,294
Hmm-mm. I hope that's not
an omen for the future.

00:25:48,197 --> 00:25:49,632
Oh.

00:25:49,632 --> 00:25:51,100
Oh, your boyfriend.

00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,068
Yeah, yours, too.
Who's he with?

00:25:53,068 --> 00:25:54,470
My boss.
He runs vice.

00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,138
What's up?

00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:57,640
Kimball's gonna do
the briefing.

00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,441
Told us to go back
into the field.

00:25:59,441 --> 00:26:01,243
Catch you later.

00:26:01,243 --> 00:26:02,511
Bye.

00:26:02,511 --> 00:26:04,513
LISTON:
<i>So, we're not talking</i>

00:26:04,513 --> 00:26:06,415
about a husband killing
his wife anymore?

00:26:06,415 --> 00:26:08,751
No, ma'am, but that is what
somebody wanted us to believe.

00:26:08,751 --> 00:26:10,986
They took advantage
of Jack's marital problems,

00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,187
set him up.

00:26:12,187 --> 00:26:13,389
So, I guess

00:26:13,389 --> 00:26:14,590
we're back to square one.

00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:16,291
We're talking about drugs.

00:26:16,291 --> 00:26:18,293
Which is why I asked
Lieutenant Kimball to join us.

00:26:18,293 --> 00:26:19,628
He was in charge
of the undercover op

00:26:19,628 --> 00:26:21,030
against Donny Price.

00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:22,231
What do you got for us?

00:26:22,231 --> 00:26:24,033
Price was
a mid-level distributor.

00:26:24,033 --> 00:26:26,735
We had a confidential informant
inside the last four months.

00:26:26,735 --> 00:26:29,204
We were getting closer
to IDing his supplier.

00:26:29,204 --> 00:26:31,473
Four months?

00:26:31,473 --> 00:26:33,609
That's about the same time
Veronica Gilmore...

00:26:33,609 --> 00:26:35,477
Dumped her husband
for her drug dealer.

00:26:35,477 --> 00:26:37,246
I guess we know who
your informant was,

00:26:37,246 --> 00:26:38,447
right?

00:26:38,447 --> 00:26:41,517
Veronica Gilmore?

00:26:41,517 --> 00:26:43,085
She got popped for possession.

00:26:43,085 --> 00:26:45,354
She made a deal;
only me and the D.A. knew.

00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:47,122
I should have been
looped in on this.

00:26:47,122 --> 00:26:48,624
'Cause Jack Gilmore's
your friend?

00:26:48,624 --> 00:26:50,359
Because I'm your boss.

00:26:53,962 --> 00:26:55,464
Well, we got
a lot bigger problems

00:26:55,464 --> 00:26:58,133
than Jack Gilmore's
sullied reputation.

00:26:58,133 --> 00:26:59,334
Why? What do you mean?

00:26:59,334 --> 00:27:02,604
Dead C.I.,
blown undercover op.

00:27:02,604 --> 00:27:06,108
We got a leak in our department.

00:27:20,956 --> 00:27:22,458
Hey.
Hey, I'm just

00:27:22,458 --> 00:27:24,359
running the bullets we pulled
out of Donny Price

00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:25,627
and his bodyguard.

00:27:25,627 --> 00:27:27,129
The whole thing's
crazy, right?

00:27:27,129 --> 00:27:28,530
I mean, a frame job
this elaborate,

00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:30,399
that makes you wonder
who's behind it.

00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,367
Yeah, I heard the department
may be compromised.

00:27:32,367 --> 00:27:33,635
We've been there before.

00:27:33,635 --> 00:27:35,137
(beeping)

00:27:35,137 --> 00:27:36,672
I don't believe it.

00:27:36,672 --> 00:27:38,273
Looks like we're there again.

00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:43,011
You texted me?

00:27:43,011 --> 00:27:47,149
I think I may have just found
this Bobby Connor guy.

00:27:47,149 --> 00:27:48,717
Brass checked out
Gilmore's story.

00:27:48,717 --> 00:27:50,319
He said the guy
doesn't exist.

00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:52,554
Well, Gilmore's been meeting
with somebody

00:27:52,554 --> 00:27:54,423
at Al's Diner.

00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:57,292
The ATM across the street
gave us a snapshot.

00:27:57,292 --> 00:27:59,027
That guy was just here.

00:27:59,027 --> 00:28:00,395
That's Lieutenant Paul Kimball.

00:28:00,395 --> 00:28:03,031
He was running the undercover op
on Donny Price.

00:28:03,031 --> 00:28:05,701
Seriously?
And if this is our
fictional Bobby Connor,

00:28:05,701 --> 00:28:07,603
then he's the guy
who set up the meeting

00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:09,438
in the alley with Gilmore.

00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:10,706
Hey, Russell?
Yeah?

00:28:10,706 --> 00:28:12,708
We need to have
a family meeting.

00:28:12,708 --> 00:28:14,643
IBIS report came back
on the bullets

00:28:14,643 --> 00:28:16,345
that killed Price
and his bodyguard.

00:28:16,345 --> 00:28:18,614
Gun was traced back to a cop
who discharged the weapon

00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:20,048
during a domestic disturbance

00:28:20,048 --> 00:28:22,317
back in 2008,
but the case was tossed.

00:28:22,317 --> 00:28:23,952
Weapon was returned
to the officer.

00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,587
Hey, guys, where are we going
with this?

00:28:25,587 --> 00:28:27,556
Who are we
talking about?
It's Jeffrey McKeen.

00:28:27,556 --> 00:28:30,058
You got to be kidding me.

00:28:30,058 --> 00:28:32,127
Who's Jeffrey McKeen?

00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:35,464
RUSSELL:
<i>Former undersheriff,</i>
<i>now serving life.</i>

00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:37,699
I read his file
when I first got here.

00:28:37,699 --> 00:28:39,368
Yeah, he murdered
a good friend of mine,

00:28:39,368 --> 00:28:40,569
CSI Warrick Brown.
He was

00:28:40,569 --> 00:28:42,171
a good friend of all of ours.

00:28:42,171 --> 00:28:44,206
So, if McKeen's in prison,
how does his gun

00:28:44,206 --> 00:28:46,108
end up committing
all these murders?

00:28:46,108 --> 00:28:47,643
He must have had
someone do it for him.

00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:49,144
Yeah, but what does
he have to gain?

00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:50,646
Yeah, I got an idea.

00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:53,048
Didn't McKeen
take over Lou Gedda's turf?

00:28:53,048 --> 00:28:55,651
Start running his drugs
and prostitution?

00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:57,052
Yeah, before he went to prison.

00:28:57,052 --> 00:28:58,287
So, maybe he hasn't stopped.

00:28:58,287 --> 00:28:59,488
Like Gotti.

00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:01,423
Godfathering from the inside.

00:29:01,423 --> 00:29:03,559
If that's the case, then he's
got people working for him

00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:05,327
on the outside.
People like Paul Kimball.

00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:06,528
You asked me

00:29:06,528 --> 00:29:08,096
to check him out.

00:29:08,096 --> 00:29:11,166
Long before Lieutenant
Kimball ran Vice...

00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,367
guess who his first partner was?

00:29:12,367 --> 00:29:14,636
Jeffrey McKeen.

00:29:14,636 --> 00:29:17,005
If Kimball has ties to
McKeen, then he's the one

00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:18,507
who set up Gilmore;
he's our guy.

00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:20,142
Yeah, so let's pick him up.

00:29:20,142 --> 00:29:21,677
Undersheriff has eyes
on him right now.

00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:24,112
No, no, no, let's just
keep eyes on him for now.

00:29:24,112 --> 00:29:26,014
We got to play this smart.

00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:28,217
Kimball's dirty, but we have
no idea how deep this goes.

00:29:28,217 --> 00:29:30,285
So, you buy Kimball
as the shooter,

00:29:30,285 --> 00:29:32,521
but not as the guy on
the outside calling the shots.

00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:34,289
Kimball's an errand boy.

00:29:34,289 --> 00:29:37,025
All we have to do is just see
if he can takes us

00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,427
to whoever is calling the shots.

00:29:38,427 --> 00:29:39,728
Let's bring McKeen in,
all right?

00:29:39,728 --> 00:29:41,530
Shake him up
a little bit.

00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,365
See who he reaches out to.

00:29:49,404 --> 00:29:52,241
Russell, right?

00:29:52,241 --> 00:29:54,209
You're the CSI that
Ecklie brought in

00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,078
to right the ship.

00:29:56,078 --> 00:29:58,013
How's that working out?

00:29:58,013 --> 00:30:00,148
Great. How's prison
working out for you?

00:30:00,148 --> 00:30:01,516
Eh, you know, I get by.

00:30:01,516 --> 00:30:02,718
Must be hard.

00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:05,554
The walls, the distance.

00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:07,956
Hard for a guy who likes
to control things,

00:30:07,956 --> 00:30:09,258
do things himself.

00:30:10,359 --> 00:30:11,660
Just like you murdered Warrick.

00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:14,229
Now come on,

00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:16,398
you know I didn't
enjoy that, Stokes.

00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:19,134
And Warrick
didn't give me a choice.

00:30:19,134 --> 00:30:20,669
Is that what happened
with Donny Price

00:30:20,669 --> 00:30:22,237
and Veronica Gilmore?

00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:23,972
You know, I'd heard
Veronica had died.

00:30:23,972 --> 00:30:25,440
Is that why I'm here?

00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,709
Who told you that Gilmore
wanted his wife killed?

00:30:27,709 --> 00:30:29,378
I don't know what
you're talking about.

00:30:29,378 --> 00:30:30,579
You screwed up, McKeen.

00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:33,582
Your people tried
to pin it on Gilmore,

00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:36,084
but they used a gun that traced
right back to you.

00:30:37,953 --> 00:30:39,554
Triple homicide.

00:30:39,554 --> 00:30:41,290
So, you help us,

00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:43,392
we help you
or it goes the other way.

00:30:43,392 --> 00:30:45,627
I'm a lifer,

00:30:45,627 --> 00:30:47,529
and you got nothing.

00:30:47,529 --> 00:30:51,700
Oh, I don't know, we can get you
out of the general population.

00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,735
Caged with all

00:30:53,735 --> 00:30:55,537
those animals.

00:30:55,537 --> 00:30:57,072
The cage is just fine.

00:30:57,072 --> 00:30:59,041
You see, this
is the thing.

00:30:59,041 --> 00:31:01,243
On the inside, I'm a cop.

00:31:01,243 --> 00:31:02,444
I'm also

00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:03,645
a cop-killer.

00:31:03,645 --> 00:31:05,147
And those two bullets

00:31:05,147 --> 00:31:07,582
that I put in your friend,
Warrick, well...

00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:11,486
That made me a hero.

00:31:13,021 --> 00:31:14,356
(stammering)

00:31:14,356 --> 00:31:15,557
I'm gonna get some air

00:31:15,557 --> 00:31:18,260
before I tear your head off.

00:31:29,504 --> 00:31:31,306
Boy, he's got that
bad cop thing down.

00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:32,741
Here's the deal.

00:31:32,741 --> 00:31:35,344
I figure that you're providing
for your family

00:31:35,344 --> 00:31:36,611
from behind bars, right?

00:31:36,611 --> 00:31:38,647
Cash. One phone call

00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:40,315
from me,

00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:43,385
and your family
is living out of a car.

00:31:45,587 --> 00:31:49,291
You leave my family
out of this, D.B.

00:31:49,291 --> 00:31:51,293
Up to you, hotshot.

00:31:53,729 --> 00:31:56,331
Sure hope Russell

00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:58,066
knows what he's doing.

00:31:58,066 --> 00:32:00,168
Everyone's got
some weakness.

00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:02,738
Especially when it comes
to family.

00:32:06,241 --> 00:32:08,677
MAN: <i>Here's 200 grand cash;</i>

00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:10,545
McKeen wants you out of town
now.

00:32:13,615 --> 00:32:15,350
It's all there;
you can count it.

00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:18,086
KIMBALL:
I don't trust you.
I trust McKeen.

00:32:18,086 --> 00:32:21,456
MAN:
Trust me when I tell you, if you
show your face, it'll be me

00:32:21,456 --> 00:32:22,657
signing the contract.

00:32:22,657 --> 00:32:24,326
I guess we just found
our shot-caller.

00:32:24,326 --> 00:32:25,627
Yeah.

00:32:25,627 --> 00:32:28,296
Russell really did
rattle McKeen's cage.

00:32:28,296 --> 00:32:29,998
And Kimball led us
right to him.
Mm-hmm.

00:32:29,998 --> 00:32:32,000
MAN: Your Vegas privileges
are pulled.

00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,468
New passport,

00:32:33,468 --> 00:32:35,070
first-class tickets.

00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:36,571
You'll be having margaritas
by morning.

00:32:36,571 --> 00:32:38,140
ECKLIE: <i>I don't get it.</i>

00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:40,742
That's Gilmore's finance guy,
Winnock.

00:32:40,742 --> 00:32:43,712
That's the last person
I would have expected.

00:32:45,013 --> 00:32:46,248
We just got made.

00:32:46,248 --> 00:32:48,150
(tires squealing)

00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:49,751
(siren blares)

00:32:59,027 --> 00:33:01,129
Drop the gun, Winnock.

00:33:02,264 --> 00:33:04,666
Do it now!

00:33:06,001 --> 00:33:07,536
I'm not McKeen.

00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:11,973
I'm not going to prison.

00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,389
He's dead.

00:33:27,389 --> 00:33:28,690
Yeah, and we just

00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:30,625
lost our best shot
at bringing McKeen down.

00:33:38,733 --> 00:33:40,702
RUSSELL:
So, where are we
on Kimball?

00:33:40,702 --> 00:33:42,737
Well, Moreno and Crenshaw found
his car abandoned,

00:33:42,737 --> 00:33:44,139
but they they got him

00:33:44,139 --> 00:33:45,373
on this watch list.

00:33:45,373 --> 00:33:46,575
They said he never hopped

00:33:46,575 --> 00:33:48,276
on that plane to Mexico.

00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:52,013
$200,000-- he can go
pretty much anywhere he wants.

00:33:52,013 --> 00:33:53,415
That's true.
We need to talk.

00:33:53,415 --> 00:33:54,749
Another family meeting?

00:33:54,749 --> 00:33:57,319
No, but family is the issue.

00:33:57,319 --> 00:34:00,689
I got the autopsy results
on David Winnock.

00:34:00,689 --> 00:34:04,559
C.O.D. was two gunshot wounds
to the chest.

00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,261
Yeah, tell us
something we don't know.

00:34:06,261 --> 00:34:08,430
No, keep reading--
the DNA part.

00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:10,432
Hit on CODIS.

00:34:10,432 --> 00:34:11,733
(hums)

00:34:11,733 --> 00:34:13,702
Familial match.

00:34:13,702 --> 00:34:15,537
Exactly.

00:34:15,537 --> 00:34:18,607
David Winnock has 13 alleles
in common with Jeffrey McKeen.

00:34:18,607 --> 00:34:21,443
Yeah, Winnock wasn't just
McKeen's shot-caller,

00:34:21,443 --> 00:34:23,478
he was his son.

00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:25,013
What could you possibly
want from me

00:34:25,013 --> 00:34:26,214
that you don't already know?

00:34:26,214 --> 00:34:28,617
His mother was a
dancer at Pigalle,

00:34:28,617 --> 00:34:30,685
married to a pit
boss named Winnock.

00:34:30,685 --> 00:34:33,355
The boy had his name
but my blood,

00:34:33,355 --> 00:34:36,191
and as he got older,
I realized he had my heart, too.

00:34:37,459 --> 00:34:39,594
I took care of both of them.

00:34:39,594 --> 00:34:41,563
And when he grew up,
your boy took care

00:34:41,563 --> 00:34:43,331
of business for you,
didn't he?

00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:45,333
You're damn right.

00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,402
He was my son.

00:34:47,402 --> 00:34:48,970
He was family.

00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:52,474
And now you know how it feels,
you son of a bitch.

00:34:52,474 --> 00:34:54,142
ECKLIE:
Karma, Jeffrey.

00:34:54,142 --> 00:34:56,511
Your son paid
for your sins.

00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:59,648
And I know you're the one that
put the bullet in him, Conrad.

00:34:59,648 --> 00:35:01,249
Hey,

00:35:01,249 --> 00:35:03,051
you're the one that put
the target on his back.

00:35:03,051 --> 00:35:04,953
If you want to blame someone,
look in the mirror.

00:35:04,953 --> 00:35:06,955
Don't get
smug with me.

00:35:06,955 --> 00:35:08,156
Your dead pal

00:35:08,156 --> 00:35:10,358
was no saint.

00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:13,495
I should have killed your punk
ass when I had the chance.

00:35:13,495 --> 00:35:16,998
Yeah, you should have.

00:35:16,998 --> 00:35:18,500
A real man would have.

00:35:20,502 --> 00:35:23,171
Nick.

00:35:24,606 --> 00:35:26,975
I might just get
that chance again.

00:35:26,975 --> 00:35:29,177
I'll make sure
to clear my calendar.

00:35:30,979 --> 00:35:32,414
The guy lives up
to his reputation.

00:35:32,414 --> 00:35:33,615
Yeah.

00:35:33,615 --> 00:35:35,116
You got anything?

00:35:35,116 --> 00:35:36,985
Detectives went over
to Winnock's office.

00:35:36,985 --> 00:35:40,155
Somebody beat us to it,
cleaned out his files.

00:35:40,155 --> 00:35:42,190
Still nothing on Kimball.

00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:43,692
Only five roads
lead out of Vegas.

00:35:43,692 --> 00:35:45,260
We got eyes on
all of them.

00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:47,395
If we can trust
our eyes anymore.

00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:50,198
I mean, who knows how deep
this thing goes, how many cops

00:35:50,198 --> 00:35:51,566
McKeen has
his hooks into?

00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:55,036
Sheriff's called a
press conference.

00:35:55,036 --> 00:35:56,671
Storm's coming.

00:35:56,671 --> 00:35:58,106
Heads are going
to roll.

00:35:58,106 --> 00:35:59,407
Yeah, hers may
be the first.

00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:01,176
LISTON:
<i>Thank you all for coming.</i>

00:36:01,176 --> 00:36:04,446
The district attorney and I
are here to announce that,

00:36:04,446 --> 00:36:06,081
as of tomorrow morning,

00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:08,650
a commission will begin
investigating allegations

00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:13,221
of corruption, bribery,
and murder

00:36:13,221 --> 00:36:15,390
within the Las Vegas
Police Department.

00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:19,694
Four years ago, when I took
office, I promised change,

00:36:19,694 --> 00:36:23,231
that the misdeeds of the
past would be just that.

00:36:24,566 --> 00:36:26,568
What a load of crap.

00:36:26,568 --> 00:36:29,571
The investigation
or the department?

00:36:29,571 --> 00:36:31,206
Both.
I hate to
say it,

00:36:31,206 --> 00:36:32,540
but the sheriff's right.

00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:34,109
We went through
this four years ago

00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:37,445
when McKeen was exposed,
and things got better.

00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:39,414
Liston was elected,
made changes.

00:36:39,414 --> 00:36:41,416
And now she's talking
about changes again.

00:36:41,416 --> 00:36:43,551
That's what I'm saying.

00:36:43,551 --> 00:36:46,154
Warrick's dead and McKeen's
still in business.

00:36:46,154 --> 00:36:47,355
It's all just talk.

00:36:47,355 --> 00:36:48,556
I vow

00:36:48,556 --> 00:36:50,325
tonight

00:36:50,325 --> 00:36:53,561
to clean up this department
once and for all.

00:36:53,561 --> 00:36:55,163
No one will be above suspicion.

00:36:55,163 --> 00:36:58,466
No one will get a free pass,
not even me.

00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:00,535
Hey.
Hey.

00:37:00,535 --> 00:37:02,170
See this?

00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:04,239
(sighs) You know, it's
going to get ugly.

00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:06,608
Hope you don't regret
me dragging you here.

00:37:06,608 --> 00:37:08,610
Hey, I make my own decisions.

00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:11,313
Look, I-I know
the Gilmore case dragged up

00:37:11,313 --> 00:37:13,348
a lot of stuff between us

00:37:13,348 --> 00:37:15,517
from the past,
but,

00:37:15,517 --> 00:37:18,253
for what it's worth,
in Seattle

00:37:18,253 --> 00:37:20,488
I never said
you were wrong.

00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:22,324
Well, then, why did you fire me?

00:37:22,324 --> 00:37:23,525
Oh, come on,

00:37:23,525 --> 00:37:25,126
you got to admit,
it was a little...

00:37:25,126 --> 00:37:28,063
Just don't say that
it was complicated.

00:37:29,197 --> 00:37:31,199
All right,
I won't say it.

00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:32,534
I really hate you sometimes.

00:37:32,534 --> 00:37:34,235
Hey, you know
what you should do?

00:37:34,235 --> 00:37:36,471
Come on over to the house
tonight, have dinner with us.

00:37:36,471 --> 00:37:37,972
Maya and Katie
are there.

00:37:37,972 --> 00:37:39,374
They'd love
to see you.

00:37:39,374 --> 00:37:41,343
I have plans.

00:37:41,343 --> 00:37:42,644
Okay.

00:37:48,216 --> 00:37:50,685
As of tomorrow morning,

00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:53,655
LVPD will no longer function

00:37:53,655 --> 00:37:56,591
as an independent
law enforcement agency.

00:37:59,661 --> 00:38:01,296
Conrad, are you okay?

00:38:01,296 --> 00:38:02,530
Yeah, sure.

00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,566
You enjoy
your dinner?

00:38:04,566 --> 00:38:05,967
And the company.

00:38:07,235 --> 00:38:09,604
We have to do it again,
just the two of us.

00:38:09,604 --> 00:38:11,106
ECKLIE:
That'll be nice.

00:38:11,106 --> 00:38:13,208
HODGES:
Ah, here's your car.

00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:16,644
I'll drive, Mother.
Uh, I'd rather you didn't.

00:38:16,644 --> 00:38:18,380
Good night, everyone.

00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:20,415
Night.

00:38:23,651 --> 00:38:26,121
You were kind of quiet
at dinner.

00:38:26,121 --> 00:38:30,091
I, I just got a
lot on my mind.

00:38:34,396 --> 00:38:37,999
Want to take a walk?

00:38:37,999 --> 00:38:39,267
Yeah.

00:38:39,267 --> 00:38:41,035
(clears throat)

00:38:41,035 --> 00:38:42,237
(clears throat)

00:38:42,237 --> 00:38:43,438
Another one.

00:38:43,438 --> 00:38:44,639
No.
Yes.

00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:46,040
Yes.
You are on your own.

00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,242
Ooh.

00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:50,111
I'm very happy
to be on my own.

00:38:50,111 --> 00:38:53,114
All right, what's going
on with you tonight?

00:38:54,149 --> 00:38:56,317
It's complicated.

00:38:56,317 --> 00:38:57,619
Yeah?

00:38:57,619 --> 00:38:59,487
You ever think that
maybe you're the one

00:38:59,487 --> 00:39:01,689
that's a little bit
complicated, hmm?

00:39:01,689 --> 00:39:04,592
You know what? It's so much
hotter when you don't talk.

00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:06,694
(scoffs)

00:39:10,298 --> 00:39:12,700
Think I'm gonna go home.

00:39:19,441 --> 00:39:21,443
RUSSELL:
<i>You knucklehead,</i>

00:39:21,443 --> 00:39:23,645
you've got your
pajamas backwards.

00:39:23,645 --> 00:39:25,046
I wear them that way.

00:39:25,046 --> 00:39:26,247
Oh, I see.

00:39:26,247 --> 00:39:27,615
Little Miss
Free Spirit.

00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:29,017
Oh, wonder
where she gets that.

00:39:29,017 --> 00:39:30,185
(chuckles)

00:39:30,185 --> 00:39:31,719
Charlie just called.

00:39:31,719 --> 00:39:34,022
Team bus got in from the
tournament, so he's on his way.

00:39:34,022 --> 00:39:35,623
Bet he'll be hungry.
I'll warm him up a plate.

00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:37,192
And I'll read a
bedtime story.

00:39:37,192 --> 00:39:38,993
Any takers?
Me.

00:39:38,993 --> 00:39:40,195
Anyone else?

00:39:40,195 --> 00:39:41,629
Uh, you go ahead.

00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:43,531
I think Mr. Merlot is
going to put me to bed.

00:39:43,531 --> 00:39:44,966
(Barbara and Russell chuckle)

00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:46,267
Go on, scoot,
scoot, scoot, scoot.

00:39:46,267 --> 00:39:47,469
Good night.

00:39:47,469 --> 00:39:48,736
KAITLYN:
Good night.

00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:51,339
Dad just never
changes, does he?

00:39:51,339 --> 00:39:52,707
No.

00:39:52,707 --> 00:39:54,509
SANDERS:
What are you saying?

00:39:54,509 --> 00:39:57,312
I mean, it's not like it's
going to make any difference

00:39:57,312 --> 00:40:00,348
'cause in this town
it's all about the game.

00:40:00,348 --> 00:40:02,717
The game never changes,
just the players.

00:40:02,717 --> 00:40:06,054
I'm starting to think
that Catherine was right.

00:40:06,054 --> 00:40:07,255
What,

00:40:07,255 --> 00:40:08,456
leaving?

00:40:08,456 --> 00:40:09,657
No, Greg,

00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,059
quitting.

00:40:11,059 --> 00:40:12,460
SIDLE:
Oh, come on,

00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:14,529
Nick, I know things have
been crazy right now, but...

00:40:14,529 --> 00:40:16,197
Hey, she once told me,

00:40:16,197 --> 00:40:19,634
"If you can't handle this job,
there is the door."

00:40:19,634 --> 00:40:21,669
You know what?

00:40:26,107 --> 00:40:28,309
I'm out.

00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:31,346
Nick.

00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:33,381
Hey.

00:40:33,381 --> 00:40:36,284
CRENSHAW:
I've seen that look.

00:40:36,284 --> 00:40:38,253
Try driving around
with him all day long.

00:40:38,253 --> 00:40:40,488
(chuckles)

00:40:40,488 --> 00:40:42,557
You look like someone
that doesn't need

00:40:42,557 --> 00:40:44,559
to talk to someone
right now, right?

00:40:46,094 --> 00:40:48,096
I could be persuaded.

00:40:48,096 --> 00:40:50,498
Good.

00:40:50,498 --> 00:40:52,166
(phone rings)

00:40:54,469 --> 00:40:55,970
Is that a girlfriend?

00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:57,372
Not right now.

00:40:57,372 --> 00:40:58,673
Can I see?

00:40:58,673 --> 00:41:01,376
Ah, whoa, she
wouldn't like that.

00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:05,513
I'm gonna go
to the bathroom.

00:41:07,181 --> 00:41:09,117
You gonna be here
when I get back?

00:41:09,117 --> 00:41:10,652
If you're lucky.

00:41:18,259 --> 00:41:20,128
It's under control.

00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:22,430
Got eyes on the package
right now.

00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:25,733
Where are we
going, anyway?

00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:29,404
Remember when I was a little
girl and I'd come visit you

00:41:29,404 --> 00:41:32,140
and you would drag me
to ride

00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:34,542
the roller coaster
at New York, New York?

00:41:34,542 --> 00:41:37,111
I thought you hated
that roller coaster.

00:41:37,111 --> 00:41:41,215
I wanted you to think
that I hated it.

00:41:41,215 --> 00:41:42,650
I'm sorry.

00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:44,018
I was a brat.

00:41:44,018 --> 00:41:46,321
No, no, no, I
deserved it.

00:41:47,455 --> 00:41:49,390
Not anymore.

00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:51,025
Hey, Undersheriff.

00:41:51,025 --> 00:41:52,961
(screams)

00:41:52,961 --> 00:41:54,462
(tires squealing)

00:41:54,462 --> 00:41:58,032
Dad, Dad... Dad!

00:41:58,032 --> 00:42:01,202
BARBARA:
I think you missed
your calling.

00:42:01,202 --> 00:42:03,037
Always good to have
something to fall back on.

00:42:03,037 --> 00:42:04,238
(chuckles)

00:42:04,238 --> 00:42:05,440
(phone chirping)

00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,641
Oh...

00:42:06,641 --> 00:42:08,076
Oh, do you have
to get it?

00:42:08,076 --> 00:42:11,012
Don't move,
I'll be right back.

00:42:13,014 --> 00:42:15,016
(phone continues chirping)

00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:18,019
Hey, Sara, what's up?

00:42:19,253 --> 00:42:21,255
Where?

00:42:21,255 --> 00:42:23,224
(phone rings)
Oh, God,
all right, oh.

00:42:23,224 --> 00:42:24,726
Hello.
All right,
rally the troops.

00:42:24,726 --> 00:42:26,694
I-I'll be there
in five minutes.

00:42:28,529 --> 00:42:30,698
What?

00:42:30,698 --> 00:42:32,734
He said to look upstairs.

00:42:36,437 --> 00:42:38,272
Katie.

00:42:38,272 --> 00:42:40,408
Kaitlyn.
Hey, Kate.

00:42:42,343 --> 00:42:43,711
(grunts)

00:42:43,711 --> 00:42:45,113
Oh, no.

00:42:45,113 --> 00:42:46,314
They've taken her.

00:42:46,314 --> 00:42:49,017
(grunts)
Don't touch anything.
