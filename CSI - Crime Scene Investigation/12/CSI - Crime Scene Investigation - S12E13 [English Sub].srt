00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:12,508
WOMAN: I've never seen
so much money spent

00:00:12,508 --> 00:00:14,510
on so little actual fabric.

00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:16,178
Well, you're
always saying

00:00:16,178 --> 00:00:17,646
it's what's inside
that counts, right?

00:00:17,646 --> 00:00:18,647
Yeah.

00:00:18,647 --> 00:00:20,182
Look where that gets me.

00:00:20,182 --> 00:00:21,783
Look, well, maybe you
should try wearing

00:00:21,783 --> 00:00:23,685
something less "granny"
than the flannel PJ's.

00:00:23,685 --> 00:00:25,454
Hey, they keep me warm!

00:00:25,454 --> 00:00:27,756
You know what else
can keep you warm?
Yeah, coffee.

00:00:27,756 --> 00:00:31,026
(laughs)
There's a place on the
third floor. I'll pay.

00:00:31,026 --> 00:00:32,528
Oh, man, I just
can't decide...

00:00:32,528 --> 00:00:34,596
No, I mean, if you
just wait two weeks,

00:00:34,596 --> 00:00:36,298
you can get it online for,
like, half the price.

00:00:36,298 --> 00:00:38,400
Yeah, but you're missing
the point-- I want it now.

00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,369
Fine. So pay the money.

00:00:40,369 --> 00:00:42,504
No. You're right.
I'll wait.

00:00:42,504 --> 00:00:44,306
You're always right.

00:00:44,306 --> 00:00:45,541
So we'll go
get coffee,

00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:47,342
and then we'll go
back and get it.

00:01:04,726 --> 00:01:06,361
(baby fussing)

00:01:08,664 --> 00:01:11,033
Aw...

00:01:13,435 --> 00:01:16,438
So cute.
(giggles)

00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:17,539
(laughs)

00:01:17,539 --> 00:01:18,473
(laughs)

00:01:26,782 --> 00:01:28,083
(elevator bell dings)

00:01:46,068 --> 00:01:48,003
We said we'd
be there at 4:00.

00:01:48,003 --> 00:01:49,171
Do you think we'll make it?

00:01:49,171 --> 00:01:51,173
Oh, we'll get there by 4:00.

00:01:53,075 --> 00:01:54,109
Eva, your hair...

00:01:54,109 --> 00:01:56,044
What?
There's a huge piece

00:01:56,044 --> 00:01:57,713
missing out of the
middle of your hair!

00:01:57,713 --> 00:01:59,448
What?! What?!
Somebody's cut it.

00:01:59,448 --> 00:02:00,616
I have no idea.

00:02:00,616 --> 00:02:02,017
Would you...?
Where? Where?

00:02:02,017 --> 00:02:03,552
How much is it?

00:02:03,552 --> 00:02:05,354
How much is it?
I don't know.
I don't know.

00:02:05,354 --> 00:02:06,455
How much is taken off?

00:02:06,455 --> 00:02:08,323
I feel so violated.

00:02:08,323 --> 00:02:09,458
(camera shutter clicks)

00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:11,727
I would, too.

00:02:11,727 --> 00:02:13,729
I mean, it's sick.

00:02:13,729 --> 00:02:15,330
Isn't it?

00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,065
Yeah.

00:02:17,065 --> 00:02:18,700
BRASS: Four days ago,
a girl in a mall.

00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,402
Now, this girl,
in a movie theater.

00:02:20,402 --> 00:02:21,470
That makes 11.

00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,205
At least that
have reported it.

00:02:23,205 --> 00:02:24,539
I'm sure there's more.

00:02:24,539 --> 00:02:28,110
The sheriff is pissed;
bad for the tourist trade.

00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,311
It's the same story--

00:02:29,311 --> 00:02:32,047
chunk of hair cut off
in a public place.

00:02:32,047 --> 00:02:33,215
They never
even feel it.

00:02:33,215 --> 00:02:34,616
Any of the women see anything?

00:02:34,616 --> 00:02:35,751
So far, no.

00:02:35,751 --> 00:02:37,452
Guy's a ghost.

00:02:37,452 --> 00:02:40,122
Yeah. Well, at least <i>I</i>
have nothing to worry about.

00:02:40,122 --> 00:02:42,090
(chuckles):
Yeah.

00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:43,458
The whole thing
is creepy.

00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:50,732
Ms. Bingham, this
is CSI Russell.

00:02:50,732 --> 00:02:52,334
Thanks for coming in.

00:02:53,769 --> 00:02:56,271
This shouldn't take
too much longer, right?

00:02:56,271 --> 00:02:59,107
I'm just gonna run a comb
through a couple of times,

00:02:59,107 --> 00:03:01,043
look for some
loose-cut hairs.

00:03:01,043 --> 00:03:03,512
It could
help us out a lot.
So...

00:03:03,512 --> 00:03:05,647
you were sitting
in a movie theater.

00:03:05,647 --> 00:03:07,015
That's right.

00:03:07,015 --> 00:03:08,450
Wow. I haven't been
to the movies

00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:09,718
for so long.

00:03:09,718 --> 00:03:11,386
Which one was it?

00:03:11,386 --> 00:03:12,621
Excuse me?

00:03:12,621 --> 00:03:14,656
You a Matt Damon fan?
(laughs softly)

00:03:14,656 --> 00:03:16,124
Uh...

00:03:16,124 --> 00:03:18,260
I'm a...
Daniel Craig girl.

00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,795
Me, too.

00:03:19,795 --> 00:03:21,296
RUSSELL:
The, uh, tuxedo

00:03:21,296 --> 00:03:22,431
and the gun, right?

00:03:22,431 --> 00:03:23,732
Hard to beat.

00:03:23,732 --> 00:03:26,101
So, Paula, you want
to tell me what happened?

00:03:26,101 --> 00:03:29,638
I-I didn't... I didn't
realize it until I got home,

00:03:29,638 --> 00:03:32,374
so he must have cut
it during the movie.

00:03:32,374 --> 00:03:33,675
But I don't get it.
Why my hair?

00:03:33,675 --> 00:03:36,111
Honestly, I have no idea.

00:03:36,111 --> 00:03:37,279
You do have great hair.

00:03:37,279 --> 00:03:38,580
(laughs)
RUSSELL: Well, there is that.

00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,015
You didn't get
a look at the guy?

00:03:40,015 --> 00:03:42,150
No. Just...

00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,019
Daniel Craig.

00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:45,020
(chuckles)

00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,154
I'm all done.

00:03:46,154 --> 00:03:48,256
Yeah, I just have
one more question.

00:03:48,256 --> 00:03:50,559
Anything else
strange happen lately?

00:03:50,559 --> 00:03:51,793
You know, purse stolen?

00:03:51,793 --> 00:03:53,795
Missing keys?
Tires slashed?

00:03:53,795 --> 00:03:55,997
No.
Okay.

00:03:55,997 --> 00:03:57,032
Good, good.

00:03:57,032 --> 00:03:58,667
Well, I am glad to hear that.

00:03:58,667 --> 00:04:01,103
Okay. Uh, bottom line,

00:04:01,103 --> 00:04:03,004
some creep
took your hair--

00:04:03,004 --> 00:04:06,408
don't let him mess
with your head.

00:04:07,576 --> 00:04:08,744
Thanks.
I'll see you out.

00:04:10,278 --> 00:04:11,747
Hold on a second.

00:04:11,747 --> 00:04:14,249
Let me give you... let me
give you one of these.

00:04:14,249 --> 00:04:15,417
Call me...

00:04:15,417 --> 00:04:17,219

need anything.

00:04:17,219 --> 00:04:18,520
Thanks.

00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,621
Yeah.

00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:23,692
Well...

00:04:23,692 --> 00:04:25,360
looks like
she feels better.

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,396
And based on your performance
in there, so do I.

00:04:27,396 --> 00:04:29,164
(phone beeps)

00:04:29,164 --> 00:04:31,633
Yeah, I just hope this little
fetish doesn't turn into

00:04:31,633 --> 00:04:33,235
something more.

00:04:36,037 --> 00:04:38,373

She, uh, sounded good.

00:07:53,468 --> 00:07:55,203
Yeah.

00:08:19,761 --> 00:08:21,229
What do we know?

00:08:21,229 --> 00:08:23,031
11 women have
come forward to report

00:08:23,031 --> 00:08:24,432
they were snipped by this guy.

00:08:24,432 --> 00:08:26,067
Including the dead girl?
Yeah.

00:08:26,067 --> 00:08:28,069
I got my guys doing welfare
checks on the other ten.

00:08:28,069 --> 00:08:29,671
But we need to assume that

00:08:29,671 --> 00:08:31,339
there are more women out there
that didn't report it.

00:08:31,339 --> 00:08:34,676
Well, let's hope they're
just shy, not dead, too.

00:08:34,676 --> 00:08:37,512
Well, best way to know that
is to reach out to the press.

00:08:37,512 --> 00:08:40,515
And create a panic?
In my city?

00:08:40,515 --> 00:08:42,183
I got enough problems.

00:08:42,183 --> 00:08:44,319
This one, you need to solve.

00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:52,093
I think she was looking at you
when she said that.

00:08:52,093 --> 00:08:54,062
(chuckling):
Yeah, right.

00:09:03,705 --> 00:09:06,675
Chain is busted,
but the lock is intact.

00:09:06,675 --> 00:09:09,344
She trusted him enough
to open the door to him.

00:09:19,154 --> 00:09:22,490
Never had a chance
to realize her mistake.

00:09:23,558 --> 00:09:25,694
(loud thud, cracking)

00:09:25,694 --> 00:09:27,562
Looks like this is where he did

00:09:27,562 --> 00:09:30,198
his extreme makeover,
psychopath edition.

00:09:31,533 --> 00:09:33,635
(sighs)

00:09:33,635 --> 00:09:36,504
Blow-dryer and curling iron
are still plugged in.

00:09:36,504 --> 00:09:39,274
Traces of makeup and
hair dye in the sink.

00:09:39,274 --> 00:09:41,276
So he snipped Eva's
hair at the mall.

00:09:41,276 --> 00:09:43,778
Obviously, he was attracted
to it for some reason.

00:09:43,778 --> 00:09:45,280
Certainly not the color.

00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,048
He turned her
into a blonde.

00:09:47,048 --> 00:09:48,349
You should watch yourself.

00:09:48,349 --> 00:09:49,784
Well, he dyed her hair.

00:09:49,784 --> 00:09:51,319
You should watch <i>yourself.</i>

00:09:51,319 --> 00:09:52,687
True.

00:09:54,189 --> 00:09:56,324
Where is the packaging?

00:09:56,324 --> 00:09:58,159
You know? The products?

00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:00,762
Guess he was smart enough
to take them with him.

00:10:00,762 --> 00:10:03,098
Smart enough to wipe
down his prints, too.

00:10:03,098 --> 00:10:04,432
Suggests planning.

00:10:04,432 --> 00:10:07,302
Guy's not just sick,
he's dangerous.

00:10:09,104 --> 00:10:11,406
WOMAN: <i>When we reported</i>
<i>what happened at the mall,</i>

00:10:11,406 --> 00:10:13,708
the officer said
it was just some weirdo,

00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:15,677
and now my sister...

00:10:17,112 --> 00:10:19,114
I'm sorry for your loss.

00:10:19,114 --> 00:10:22,383
It's the same guy,
isn't it?

00:10:24,052 --> 00:10:25,720
You people should
have warned us.

00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,724
Listen, if I could bring
your sister back, I would.

00:10:29,724 --> 00:10:33,128
But I need your help
right now, so we can

00:10:33,128 --> 00:10:35,597
keep this from happening
to someone else, okay?

00:10:37,031 --> 00:10:38,466
Yeah.

00:10:38,466 --> 00:10:40,535
Now, after the
mall incident,

00:10:40,535 --> 00:10:43,438
did your sister receive
any strange phone calls?

00:10:43,438 --> 00:10:45,340
Did she think somebody
was following her?

00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:47,375
Anything like that?
No.

00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,712
Do you recognize
this dress?

00:10:52,013 --> 00:10:54,015
Those sunglasses?

00:10:54,015 --> 00:10:55,717
No. Why?

00:10:55,717 --> 00:10:58,553
Your sister was wearing
them when we found her.

00:10:58,553 --> 00:11:00,021
Those aren't hers.

00:11:00,021 --> 00:11:01,289
You sure?
I know Eva's style.

00:11:01,289 --> 00:11:03,224
She hated retro.

00:11:03,224 --> 00:11:05,727
Even as a kid, she refused
to wear hand-me-downs.

00:11:07,228 --> 00:11:09,097
He dressed her up?!

00:11:10,431 --> 00:11:12,333
What else did he do to her?

00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:13,434
ROBBINS:
<i>I found no sign</i>

00:11:13,434 --> 00:11:15,370
of sexual assault,
and besides

00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:17,438
the facial lacerations
caused by the door,

00:11:17,438 --> 00:11:21,309
there were no other
apparent injuries perimortem.

00:11:21,309 --> 00:11:24,779
So the eyes were
gouged out postmortem?

00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:28,049
Tissue is withdrawn,
nonresponsive.

00:11:28,049 --> 00:11:29,317
Cause of death?

00:11:29,317 --> 00:11:32,120
Well, it wasn't
the braid in her throat.

00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,489
She died
of a morphine overdose.

00:11:34,489 --> 00:11:37,058
The killer injected her
in the carotid artery.

00:11:37,058 --> 00:11:40,395
Death was
relatively quick.

00:11:40,395 --> 00:11:43,164
Boy, I didn't see
that one coming.

00:11:43,164 --> 00:11:47,168
Okay, so our guy forces
his way in, kills her,

00:11:47,168 --> 00:11:48,703
then he has his fun--

00:11:48,703 --> 00:11:52,173
eyes, makeover, braid
down the throat.

00:11:52,173 --> 00:11:55,343
And that wasn't the only
hair he left behind.

00:11:55,343 --> 00:11:57,145
The killer used
hair extensions

00:11:57,145 --> 00:12:00,081
to repair the area
he'd cut off in the elevator.

00:12:00,081 --> 00:12:04,552
Not quite the same
shade as the dye job.

00:12:04,552 --> 00:12:06,087
So what do you think
it all means?

00:12:06,087 --> 00:12:09,357
He breaks her so
he can fix her?

00:12:36,584 --> 00:12:40,421
♪ ♪

00:13:07,515 --> 00:13:09,550
You ever see that
Japanese movie <i>The Ring</i>

00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,185
about that creepy girl

00:13:11,185 --> 00:13:13,554
who lives in a well
and vomits hair?

00:13:13,554 --> 00:13:15,089
I thought the only
Japanese culture

00:13:15,089 --> 00:13:16,691
that you knew about
was octopus porn.

00:13:16,691 --> 00:13:19,093
You should be nicer to me.

00:13:19,093 --> 00:13:20,161
Why?

00:13:20,161 --> 00:13:21,262
I'll tell you.

00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:25,300
The braid you fished
out of your victim

00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,602
I sorted
and meticulously measured.

00:13:27,602 --> 00:13:29,604
Henry ran mitochondrial DNA,

00:13:29,604 --> 00:13:31,306
and it turns out
that the hairs

00:13:31,306 --> 00:13:32,607
in the braid
are from

00:13:32,607 --> 00:13:34,676
26 different women.

00:13:34,676 --> 00:13:35,743
Twenty-six?

00:13:35,743 --> 00:13:37,378
Including the 11 who reported

00:13:37,378 --> 00:13:39,280
having their locks snipped
by our hair stalker.

00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,116
I know what you're
thinking-- holy hairball.

00:13:42,116 --> 00:13:44,018
That's not what I'm thinking.

00:13:44,018 --> 00:13:46,354
What I'm thinking is, this braid
may be more than a calling card.

00:13:46,354 --> 00:13:48,122
Like a list of
future victims?

00:13:48,122 --> 00:13:49,390
If you're braided,
you're branded.

00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,625
Mm.

00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,460
Still doesn't
tell us who's next.

00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,095
HODGES:
So what do we do?

00:13:54,095 --> 00:13:55,763
Follow up with the list of names
we do know and see

00:13:55,763 --> 00:13:58,166
if anyone's noticed someone
looking over their shoulder.

00:14:05,473 --> 00:14:07,642
SHERIFF: Don't need to be
a profiler to see it.

00:14:07,642 --> 00:14:11,713
RUSSELL:
Slender, 20s, long hair...

00:14:11,713 --> 00:14:14,415
and these are just
the ones we know about.

00:14:19,487 --> 00:14:21,589
How are we supposed
to protect these girls?

00:14:21,589 --> 00:14:25,126
Well, we can't put a car 24-7
in front of every house.

00:14:25,126 --> 00:14:26,728
You just need
to catch this guy.

00:14:26,728 --> 00:14:30,131
Any no-shows among the women
who came forward?

00:14:30,131 --> 00:14:31,699
Yeah, one:
Joyce Debernardi.

00:14:31,699 --> 00:14:33,034
Henderson address.

00:14:33,034 --> 00:14:35,770
I left a, a message
on her cell.

00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:38,773
(ringtone playing)

00:14:38,773 --> 00:14:39,774
Brass.

00:14:39,774 --> 00:14:42,143
He was checking up on her.

00:14:42,143 --> 00:14:43,344
Hey, Jim.

00:14:43,344 --> 00:14:45,279
(sighs)

00:14:47,682 --> 00:14:50,318
Joyce Debernardi just showed up.

00:15:01,562 --> 00:15:03,598
SIDLE:
Day shift got the call.

00:15:03,598 --> 00:15:06,100
Similar crime
scene, same M.O.

00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,136
RUSSELL: She was found
just like this?

00:15:08,136 --> 00:15:11,339
Déjà vu all over again.

00:15:13,408 --> 00:15:15,410
Not quite.

00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:19,414
Eva's eyes
were gouged out.

00:15:19,414 --> 00:15:20,782
This is different.

00:15:20,782 --> 00:15:23,718
Proteins in the cornea
are coagulated.

00:15:23,718 --> 00:15:26,320
Bastard used ammonia
to blind her.

00:15:30,024 --> 00:15:34,262
(screams)

00:15:35,696 --> 00:15:40,001
They, uh, found vomit in
close proximity to the body.

00:15:40,001 --> 00:15:41,135
Reaction to the chemical.

00:15:41,135 --> 00:15:42,136
Unlike Eva,

00:15:42,136 --> 00:15:43,371
she was alive when he did this.

00:15:43,371 --> 00:15:44,672
Alive but helpless.

00:15:44,672 --> 00:15:47,175
They also found partially
digested pills--

00:15:47,175 --> 00:15:48,709
Succinylcholine
in vomitus.

00:15:48,709 --> 00:15:51,045
That's a paralytic.

00:15:51,045 --> 00:15:52,780
That's how he's getting
better at the makeup.

00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,749
(panting)

00:15:57,452 --> 00:15:59,387
(gasping quietly)

00:15:59,387 --> 00:16:01,756
He's taking his time,
he's savoring it.

00:16:01,756 --> 00:16:03,724
He's getting more confident.

00:16:03,724 --> 00:16:06,394
Which means he's getting
harder to catch.

00:16:15,069 --> 00:16:16,671
(weak breathing)

00:16:22,543 --> 00:16:24,212
(weakly):
Help...

00:16:48,269 --> 00:16:50,271
Two women--

00:16:50,271 --> 00:16:53,674
both have their hair cut by this
nut-job, now they're dead,

00:16:53,674 --> 00:16:56,511
dressed up
like some '70s fantasy.

00:16:56,511 --> 00:16:58,079
When did we get
the first report

00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,113
of this guy cutting hair?

00:17:00,181 --> 00:17:01,215
Three weeks ago,
Sheriff.

00:17:01,215 --> 00:17:02,583
Three weeks?

00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,018
Clearly he didn't just
step over the line.

00:17:04,018 --> 00:17:06,087
This guy's escalating.
Fast.

00:17:06,087 --> 00:17:07,255
What are you two doing about it?

00:17:07,255 --> 00:17:08,523
Well, right now,
we're listening

00:17:08,523 --> 00:17:10,224
'cause he's, he's talking to us.

00:17:10,224 --> 00:17:12,059
He's sending letters now, what?

00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:15,563
No, these... found
in the throats

00:17:15,563 --> 00:17:17,098
of our two victims.

00:17:17,098 --> 00:17:19,600
That braid has hair
from 26 different women,

00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,370
including our two
murdered ones.

00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:24,639
He's given us a list
of who he's going after.

00:17:24,639 --> 00:17:26,340
11 of the names
we know,

00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:29,143
15 we don't--
women whose hair has been cut

00:17:29,143 --> 00:17:30,444
but they never came forward
to report it.

00:17:30,444 --> 00:17:32,013
All of these women

00:17:32,013 --> 00:17:34,415
are in danger
and they all deserve to know it.

00:17:36,117 --> 00:17:38,519
I came here to be briefed,
not told what to do.

00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:39,654
I understand,
but I think

00:17:39,654 --> 00:17:41,289
we need to go to the press.

00:17:41,289 --> 00:17:43,124
You know, any panic
this may cause--

00:17:43,124 --> 00:17:46,127
it's worth it if we can save
just, just one life.

00:17:48,162 --> 00:17:50,531
I'll talk to the mayor.

00:17:50,531 --> 00:17:51,599
Thank you.

00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:52,767
That's my job.

00:17:52,767 --> 00:17:54,068
Do yours.

00:17:55,636 --> 00:17:57,538
HODGES: <i>Dresses our victims</i>
<i>were found in</i>

00:17:57,538 --> 00:18:00,541
are both vintage,
no retro imitations,

00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:03,110
the real deal,
circa 1978.

00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:05,379
(snickers)
What?

00:18:05,379 --> 00:18:07,381
I... I can't talk to you
behind that dress, man.

00:18:07,381 --> 00:18:09,016
Looks like you're wearing
that thing.

00:18:09,016 --> 00:18:10,251
Oh.
(chuckles)

00:18:10,251 --> 00:18:13,020
So, '70s, huh,
you sure about that?

00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,288
Yeah, I spoke
with an expert.

00:18:14,288 --> 00:18:15,289
Oh, yeah, who's that?

00:18:15,289 --> 00:18:17,158
My mother.
Mm.

00:18:17,158 --> 00:18:18,593
She's a bit of
a clotheshorse.

00:18:18,593 --> 00:18:20,328
Still has the figure
for it, though.

00:18:20,328 --> 00:18:21,729
I'll take
your word for that.

00:18:21,729 --> 00:18:25,266
Well, anyway, uh, hand-
stitching on the sleeve,

00:18:25,266 --> 00:18:27,435
original label,
real silk,

00:18:27,435 --> 00:18:30,438
all beautifully preserved,
thanks to dichlorobenzene.

00:18:30,438 --> 00:18:31,439
You mean mothballs.

00:18:31,439 --> 00:18:32,740
Exactly.

00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,075
So I doubt that the
killer found these

00:18:34,075 --> 00:18:35,276
on a rack in a
thrift store.

00:18:35,276 --> 00:18:36,577
No, he probably
had 'em in storage,

00:18:36,577 --> 00:18:38,312
then pulled 'em out
and put 'em

00:18:38,312 --> 00:18:39,747
on our victims.

00:18:39,747 --> 00:18:41,315
Perhaps these dresses belong
to somebody he knows.

00:18:41,315 --> 00:18:44,318
Yeah, it's starting
to add up now.

00:18:44,318 --> 00:18:45,586
Maybe it wasn't
somebody he knows

00:18:45,586 --> 00:18:46,787
but someone
he was trying

00:18:46,787 --> 00:18:49,123
to turn these women into.

00:18:49,123 --> 00:18:51,025
The mayor and I wish
to assure the city

00:18:51,025 --> 00:18:52,326
that we are doing all we can

00:18:52,326 --> 00:18:54,328
to bring this perpetrator
to justice.

00:18:54,328 --> 00:18:55,329
As a woman,

00:18:55,329 --> 00:18:57,565
parent,

00:18:57,565 --> 00:19:00,334
I understand your
fears, and I appeal

00:19:00,334 --> 00:19:02,536
to anyone who may have been
a victim

00:19:02,536 --> 00:19:05,439
of the Shear Stalker
or who may have any information

00:19:05,439 --> 00:19:09,410
regarding his identity,
to please call 911.

00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:12,546
Shear Stalker-- wow,
they already have a name.

00:19:12,546 --> 00:19:14,215
You got the sheriff

00:19:14,215 --> 00:19:15,483
to go public.

00:19:15,483 --> 00:19:17,084
Very impressive.

00:19:17,084 --> 00:19:19,620
I appealed to her sense
of civic duty.

00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:20,688
And her fear of voters?

00:19:22,189 --> 00:19:25,359
There's a lot
riding on this.

00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:27,161
We'll catch him.

00:19:28,529 --> 00:19:32,199
Hodges, um, told me
about the dresses.

00:19:32,199 --> 00:19:34,268
I mean, we may not be getting
a picture of our killer,

00:19:34,268 --> 00:19:37,104
but maybe we have
a picture of his obsession.

00:19:37,104 --> 00:19:39,106
Blonde, size-six.

00:19:39,106 --> 00:19:40,641
If she were in her
20s in the 1970s,

00:19:40,641 --> 00:19:42,610
she'd be 60-something now.

00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:45,179
What do you think
this guy's deal is--

00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:46,514
fear of women,

00:19:46,514 --> 00:19:49,517
something deeper, maybe
"Mommy never loved me"?

00:19:49,517 --> 00:19:52,620
Personally, I always tend
to go to my <i>Psycho</i> place

00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,388
when killers start
playing dress-up.

00:19:54,388 --> 00:19:56,190
I always go to my
Ted Bundy place--

00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:58,726
predator, narcissistic,

00:19:58,726 --> 00:20:02,029
dissociative identity disorder,
woman hater.

00:20:02,029 --> 00:20:03,164
I'm not so sure.

00:20:03,164 --> 00:20:05,066
Tox came back
on our second victim--

00:20:05,066 --> 00:20:06,167
same as the first.

00:20:06,167 --> 00:20:07,335
C.O.D.--
morphine overdose.

00:20:07,335 --> 00:20:09,437
I mean, tha-that's
oddly gentle.

00:20:09,437 --> 00:20:11,439
He's putting them
to sleep, you know?

00:20:11,439 --> 00:20:13,374
Plus, all the care
he's taking to,

00:20:13,374 --> 00:20:15,543
to remake them,
to redress them.

00:20:15,543 --> 00:20:17,611
Where are you going with this?

00:20:17,611 --> 00:20:20,181
You know, put it all together,
maybe it doesn't spell hate.

00:20:20,181 --> 00:20:21,549
Maybe it spells love.

00:20:21,549 --> 00:20:23,517
Love?! Really!

00:20:25,086 --> 00:20:27,421
Well, he's still
gouging their eyes out.

00:20:30,024 --> 00:20:31,759
That's true.

00:20:34,261 --> 00:20:36,097
BRODY:
These are the hair extensions
Doc Robbins found

00:20:36,097 --> 00:20:37,098
on our victims.

00:20:37,098 --> 00:20:38,366
The hair...

00:20:38,366 --> 00:20:40,534
all came from one person.

00:20:40,534 --> 00:20:42,703
I compared it to the 26 other
hairs we found in the braids.

00:20:42,703 --> 00:20:43,704
Guess what?

00:20:43,704 --> 00:20:44,772
No match on any of them.

00:20:44,772 --> 00:20:47,641
So, if the braid
is a to-do list,

00:20:47,641 --> 00:20:49,477
then this person
is not a target.

00:20:49,477 --> 00:20:51,512
Henry run DNA?

00:20:51,512 --> 00:20:53,414
Yep, hair and dress match.

00:20:53,414 --> 00:20:54,782
Okay, killer
definitely had access

00:20:54,782 --> 00:20:56,684
to clothes and hair
from the same person.

00:20:56,684 --> 00:20:59,320
The person he's making
our victims into,

00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,189
and I'm assuming that this
mystery woman is not in CODIS.

00:21:02,189 --> 00:21:05,393
No, so I ran isotope ratios
on the hair.

00:21:05,393 --> 00:21:07,661
I can't give you an exact
timeline, but it looks like

00:21:07,661 --> 00:21:09,764
our mystery woman
has been doing some traveling--

00:21:09,764 --> 00:21:11,298
Japan, Germany, Southern Nevada.

00:21:11,298 --> 00:21:13,033
She gets around.

00:21:13,033 --> 00:21:14,101
And not for pleasure.

00:21:14,101 --> 00:21:15,436
I also ran tox.

00:21:15,436 --> 00:21:17,104
Every time she traveled,

00:21:17,104 --> 00:21:20,174
readings would spike in
alkylatic antineoplastic agents

00:21:20,174 --> 00:21:21,242
and antimetabolites.

00:21:21,242 --> 00:21:22,710
Cancer meds.
Turns out

00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:25,279
Hamburg, Tokyo, and Las Vegas
all have hospitals

00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:27,281
that specialize in rare cancers.

00:21:27,281 --> 00:21:29,083
Which hospital in Vegas?

00:21:30,418 --> 00:21:32,420
SIDLE:
<i>Dr. Bill Ryan?</i>

00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,687
That's right.

00:21:33,687 --> 00:21:35,055
Hi. Uh, CSI Sidle.

00:21:35,055 --> 00:21:36,190
This is CSI Brody.

00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:37,391
From the crime lab-- we called.

00:21:37,391 --> 00:21:39,360
How can I help you?

00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,296
We are looking for a patient
who is-- <i>was</i> under your care.

00:21:42,296 --> 00:21:45,332
SIDLE:
We know that the, uh,
patient is female.

00:21:45,332 --> 00:21:48,736
She was treated previously at
clinics in Tokyo and Hamburg.

00:21:51,338 --> 00:21:54,074
You know
who we're talking about?

00:21:54,074 --> 00:21:56,477
I'm sorry, even if I did,
doctor-patient confidentiality

00:21:56,477 --> 00:21:59,046
would preclude me
from confirming it.

00:21:59,046 --> 00:22:00,147
SIDLE:
Of course.

00:22:00,147 --> 00:22:02,750
Have you watched
TV lately?

00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:05,085
The killer who is cutting
people's hair?

00:22:05,085 --> 00:22:07,388
Does this patient
you're looking for

00:22:07,388 --> 00:22:09,089
have something to do with that?

00:22:09,089 --> 00:22:11,625
She may be our only way
to identify that killer.

00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:14,128
SIDLE:
Yeah, doctor, um,

00:22:14,128 --> 00:22:15,129
Do you have a wife?

00:22:15,129 --> 00:22:16,697
Daughters, a sister?

00:22:16,697 --> 00:22:20,367
Women all over this town are
absolutely terrified right now.

00:22:20,367 --> 00:22:23,370
I carry a gun, and you
know the first thing I did

00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:24,638
when I stepped
off your elevator?

00:22:24,638 --> 00:22:26,307
I checked my hair.

00:22:26,307 --> 00:22:28,709
I looked behind me
to make sure nobody was there.

00:22:51,765 --> 00:22:54,502
Look, I'm going to
go grab a coffee.

00:22:54,502 --> 00:22:55,769
When I get back,

00:22:55,769 --> 00:22:58,305
I hope that file
is still here.

00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,243
Thank you, Doctor.

00:23:07,414 --> 00:23:09,416
RUSSELL:
<i>Her name's Lucinda Kemp.</i>

00:23:09,416 --> 00:23:11,685
Cancer patient,
Desert Palm Hospital.

00:23:11,685 --> 00:23:13,554
She may be our killer's muse.

00:23:13,554 --> 00:23:15,556
Muse? Muse how?

00:23:15,556 --> 00:23:17,658
Well, he's dressing the victims
up in her clothes.

00:23:17,658 --> 00:23:19,627
He's making them up
to look like her.

00:23:19,627 --> 00:23:21,028
A younger version of her.

00:23:21,028 --> 00:23:22,129
Really?

00:23:22,129 --> 00:23:23,464
A dying cancer patient?

00:23:23,464 --> 00:23:27,268
That's some theory
you got going on there.

00:23:27,268 --> 00:23:30,771
Well, I'm feeling a hell of a
lot better about it right now.

00:23:32,673 --> 00:23:34,475
What do you think?

00:23:34,475 --> 00:23:37,411
Two dead young women.

00:23:40,514 --> 00:23:42,750
And your muse is a dead ringer.

00:23:47,321 --> 00:23:49,390
(thunder rumbling)

00:24:08,442 --> 00:24:10,511
(doorbell buzzes)

00:24:15,149 --> 00:24:16,150
(knocking on door)

00:24:19,286 --> 00:24:20,220
(knocking)

00:24:21,455 --> 00:24:23,190
RUSSELL:
Paula?

00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:25,326
Hey, uh, you said
I could call you anytime.

00:24:25,326 --> 00:24:26,527
Is something the matter?

00:24:26,527 --> 00:24:28,329
I think somebody
was inside my house.

00:24:28,329 --> 00:24:30,197
The sliding door
is open a little,

00:24:30,197 --> 00:24:31,999
and there's someone
banging on my door.

00:24:31,999 --> 00:24:33,167
(doorbell buzzes, knocking)

00:24:33,167 --> 00:24:35,235
Could you have left it open?

00:24:35,235 --> 00:24:37,538
No... I don't... Maybe?

00:24:37,538 --> 00:24:39,340
(knocking continues)

00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,541
There's somebody
knocking at my door.

00:24:40,541 --> 00:24:41,675
Paula, listen to me.

00:24:41,675 --> 00:24:43,110
Can you see who it is?

00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:44,111
Hold on.

00:24:49,316 --> 00:24:51,185
It's a delivery guy.

00:24:51,185 --> 00:24:52,486
I'm scared.

00:24:52,486 --> 00:24:54,188
Do not open the door.

00:24:54,188 --> 00:24:56,457
Tell him you'll pick up
the package later.

00:24:56,457 --> 00:24:59,026
I'm gonna send a car over
to check on you right now.

00:24:59,026 --> 00:25:00,361
Okay.

00:25:00,361 --> 00:25:02,262
Everything's gonna be okay.

00:25:02,262 --> 00:25:04,031
I promise.

00:25:04,031 --> 00:25:05,232
Thanks.

00:25:05,232 --> 00:25:06,367
BRASS:
<i>I did a welfare check</i>

00:25:06,367 --> 00:25:07,668
on Paula Bingham.

00:25:07,668 --> 00:25:09,703
She's okay; really was
a delivery guy.

00:25:09,703 --> 00:25:10,704
But I can't blame her, though.

00:25:10,704 --> 00:25:12,206
Everyone's scared.

00:25:12,206 --> 00:25:14,708
Sooner we catch this guy,
the better.

00:25:14,708 --> 00:25:17,611
I'm just hoping
that Norma Desmond

00:25:17,611 --> 00:25:19,279
can I.D. her secret admirer.

00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:20,648
Talk to you later.

00:25:20,648 --> 00:25:23,584
Mrs. Kemp, do you
recognize these women?

00:25:29,089 --> 00:25:30,257
No, I don't think so.

00:25:30,257 --> 00:25:31,258
Should I?

00:25:31,258 --> 00:25:32,493
They were murdered.

00:25:32,493 --> 00:25:34,228
After that, the killer

00:25:34,228 --> 00:25:36,497
gave them a makeover.

00:25:36,497 --> 00:25:38,632
Dyed their hair blonde,
red lipstick,

00:25:38,632 --> 00:25:40,501
mascara.

00:25:40,501 --> 00:25:43,504
That's... horrible.

00:25:43,504 --> 00:25:45,639
Truly, but...

00:25:45,639 --> 00:25:48,075
why are you showing them to me?

00:25:48,075 --> 00:25:49,576
Those are your dresses, right?

00:25:49,576 --> 00:25:51,578
Well, I mean, they certainly
look like my dresses.

00:25:51,578 --> 00:25:52,680
They're my style.

00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,548
My style never
goes out of style.

00:25:54,548 --> 00:25:55,749
I don't understand

00:25:55,749 --> 00:25:57,084
why you're showing me these.

00:25:57,084 --> 00:25:58,419
I don't, either.

00:25:58,419 --> 00:25:59,687
On the phone,
you said you

00:25:59,687 --> 00:26:01,221
needed me to answer
some questions.

00:26:01,221 --> 00:26:02,523
Now, I come down here,

00:26:02,523 --> 00:26:05,292
and you're treating me
like a common criminal.

00:26:05,292 --> 00:26:06,660
These two women are dead.

00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,462
And the evidence suggests

00:26:08,462 --> 00:26:10,631
that you're our only
link to our killer.
Evidence?

00:26:10,631 --> 00:26:11,999
What evidence?

00:26:11,999 --> 00:26:13,133
Well, Adam,

00:26:13,133 --> 00:26:15,335
the women were staged

00:26:15,335 --> 00:26:17,604
in dresses that
had residual DNA.

00:26:17,604 --> 00:26:20,207
That DNA matched
hair extensions

00:26:20,207 --> 00:26:22,676
that were attached
to the victim's heads.

00:26:22,676 --> 00:26:25,446
Hair that came from your mother.

00:26:25,446 --> 00:26:26,380
My hair?

00:26:27,448 --> 00:26:29,383
No, that's impossible.

00:26:29,383 --> 00:26:31,051
Well, ma'am, in
this day and age,

00:26:31,051 --> 00:26:33,020
everything's possible.
Really, Captain.

00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,221
It's not.

00:26:37,591 --> 00:26:39,326
No one has taken my hair.

00:26:39,326 --> 00:26:43,564
Because the cancer
already took it.

00:26:43,564 --> 00:26:45,299
Three months ago,
my mother finished

00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:46,767
her last stage of chemo.

00:26:46,767 --> 00:26:49,636
You can see the results.

00:26:49,636 --> 00:26:51,105
I'm... sorry.

00:26:51,105 --> 00:26:52,506
I'm not.

00:26:52,506 --> 00:26:54,575
I'm done being sorry.

00:26:54,575 --> 00:26:57,578
Or... afraid.

00:26:57,578 --> 00:27:00,047
Or reflective.

00:27:00,047 --> 00:27:02,015
I am in remission.

00:27:02,015 --> 00:27:04,051
Thanks to Dr. Ryan.

00:27:04,051 --> 00:27:07,020
And to Jeffrey's
positive attitude.

00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,388
And who is Jeffrey?

00:27:08,388 --> 00:27:10,023
Jeffrey Fitzgerald.

00:27:10,023 --> 00:27:11,024
He's a beautiful man.

00:27:11,024 --> 00:27:12,459
Inside and out.

00:27:14,695 --> 00:27:16,130
Mrs. Kemp, is that wig

00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:18,065
made from your real hair?

00:27:18,065 --> 00:27:21,668
When I started to lose my hair,

00:27:21,668 --> 00:27:24,538
someone recommended a wig maker.

00:27:24,538 --> 00:27:27,441
I did my homework, and
I found the best: Jeffrey.

00:27:27,441 --> 00:27:31,779
When your insides
are eroding,

00:27:31,779 --> 00:27:34,081
your outside's
all you have left.

00:27:34,081 --> 00:27:36,683
Your, uh, wig maker, Jeffrey,

00:27:36,683 --> 00:27:39,086
was he was the one who collected
your hair to make the wig?

00:27:39,086 --> 00:27:41,321
No. I did.

00:27:41,321 --> 00:27:42,489
I brought it to his studio.

00:27:42,489 --> 00:27:43,657
It's out near Silverado Ranch.

00:27:43,657 --> 00:27:44,658
Along with some
of my dresses.

00:27:44,658 --> 00:27:46,493
As inspiration.

00:27:46,493 --> 00:27:47,761
Inspiration?

00:27:47,761 --> 00:27:49,530
Jeffrey is an artist.

00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:53,066
He asked me when I felt the
most beautiful, so that he could

00:27:53,066 --> 00:27:54,301
repaint my life.

00:27:54,301 --> 00:27:56,170
He knows hair

00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:58,705
like Monet knows light.

00:27:58,705 --> 00:28:00,374
When was the last time
you saw Jeffrey?

00:28:00,374 --> 00:28:02,409
Just a few days ago.

00:28:02,409 --> 00:28:05,179
He still comes around
to give me a comb-out.

00:28:05,179 --> 00:28:07,381
He sounds

00:28:07,381 --> 00:28:10,184
very devoted to you.

Let me go! Let me go!

00:28:53,427 --> 00:28:55,295
What did you do to her?

00:29:01,268 --> 00:29:02,436
Stop looking at my hair.

00:29:02,436 --> 00:29:03,537
Sorry, I can't help myself.

00:29:03,537 --> 00:29:05,372
STOKES:
Hey.

00:29:05,372 --> 00:29:06,773
You're just lucky your client's
not pressing charges.

00:29:06,773 --> 00:29:08,108
Charges?

00:29:08,108 --> 00:29:10,377
I was performing a
service, which you

00:29:10,377 --> 00:29:12,012
interrupted.
A service?

00:29:12,012 --> 00:29:13,280
That's what you're calling it?

00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,415
My client is...

00:29:15,415 --> 00:29:17,050
how shall we say...

00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:19,453
a professional woman

00:29:19,453 --> 00:29:21,722
who lost a
valuable asset,

00:29:21,722 --> 00:29:23,490
her hair,

00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:25,726
but doesn't have the assets
to afford a proper transplant.

00:29:25,726 --> 00:29:29,062
And so, I offered her
an affordable,

00:29:29,062 --> 00:29:33,267
permanent solution:
stitching acrylic hair

00:29:33,267 --> 00:29:34,601
directly into the scalp.
And do you

00:29:34,601 --> 00:29:36,036
have a license to do that?

00:29:36,036 --> 00:29:38,038
I'm certified in
body modification.

00:29:38,038 --> 00:29:39,640
However, my main
trade is wig making,

00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,042
for a clientele that
needs restorations,

00:29:42,042 --> 00:29:46,580
not only of the hair,
but of their self-esteem.

00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:48,015
Yeah, we've seen your work.

00:29:48,015 --> 00:29:49,249
You're quite the artist.
Thank you.

00:29:49,249 --> 00:29:51,518
I, uh, I like to think
that I give back

00:29:51,518 --> 00:29:54,454
what God hath taken away.

00:29:54,454 --> 00:29:56,790
Well, you hath a
very inflated idea

00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:59,359
of yourself, Mr. Fitzgerald.

00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:03,163
Image is everything.

00:30:07,167 --> 00:30:09,102
I knew this guy on days.

00:30:09,102 --> 00:30:11,071
He had a hair phobia.

00:30:11,071 --> 00:30:13,307
Any time there was a crime
scene involving hair,

00:30:13,307 --> 00:30:15,208
he'd puke his guts out.

00:30:15,208 --> 00:30:17,210
He'd hate this.

00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:18,345
I got one of those.

00:30:18,345 --> 00:30:19,413
Really?

00:30:19,413 --> 00:30:21,348
What's your kryptonite?

00:30:21,348 --> 00:30:24,084
Braids.

00:30:24,084 --> 00:30:25,419
You got a hair thing, too?

00:30:25,419 --> 00:30:27,054
No.

00:30:27,054 --> 00:30:28,622
Braids.

00:30:28,622 --> 00:30:32,192
Jeffery Fitzgerald
had a thing for braids.

00:30:36,396 --> 00:30:38,265
And vintage clothing, too.

00:30:38,265 --> 00:30:39,366
What?

00:30:41,301 --> 00:30:43,003
That dress
look familiar?

00:30:44,104 --> 00:30:45,539
I do smell mothballs.

00:30:47,441 --> 00:30:48,675

00:31:20,774 --> 00:31:22,676
Lucinda Kemp.

00:31:22,676 --> 00:31:24,111
One of the lives
you "restored."

00:31:24,111 --> 00:31:25,545
Yeah, yes,

00:31:25,545 --> 00:31:27,481
I gave her back her hair,
restored her beauty.

00:31:27,481 --> 00:31:28,648
And you're still doing that.

00:31:28,648 --> 00:31:30,617
You give her
a comb-out every week.

00:31:30,617 --> 00:31:33,620
Is combing out
a crime now?

00:31:34,788 --> 00:31:36,723
(clears throat)

00:31:38,425 --> 00:31:41,161
You know what I think
all this is for him?

00:31:41,161 --> 00:31:42,396
Foreplay.

00:31:42,396 --> 00:31:43,663
Before you have

00:31:43,663 --> 00:31:46,400
your real fun with
these girls, am I right?

00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,136
Do you recognize
that morphine?

00:31:49,136 --> 00:31:52,139
We found morphine
in two dead women.

00:31:52,139 --> 00:31:55,075
I've never seen it before.

00:31:55,075 --> 00:31:56,576
Our guys just discovered it
in your studio.

00:31:58,245 --> 00:32:01,581
Just so I'm clear:

00:32:01,581 --> 00:32:03,150
You found unmarked morphine,

00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:06,620
in a place that I rent,

00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:09,356
after you let yourself in
without an invitation.

00:32:11,058 --> 00:32:12,592
I'm sorry, I just don't see

00:32:12,592 --> 00:32:16,763
how that problem
relates to me at all.

00:32:16,763 --> 00:32:19,032

Lucinda's hair, the morphine.

00:32:25,472 --> 00:32:26,640
We got him.

00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,275
What about hair braids?

00:32:28,275 --> 00:32:29,509
Greg's running them now,
along with the rest

00:32:29,509 --> 00:32:31,144
of the hair from
Fitzgerald's studio.

00:32:31,144 --> 00:32:33,046
You do not want to go into
trace lab right now.

00:32:33,046 --> 00:32:34,581
Where I don't want
to go is into court

00:32:34,581 --> 00:32:36,483
without a DNA
match on the hair.

00:32:36,483 --> 00:32:38,718
I mean, all the morphine
and dresses in the world

00:32:38,718 --> 00:32:40,720
won't matter at all
if we can't connect

00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,056

00:38:45,185 --> 00:38:46,586
in Paula Bingham's bathroom.

00:38:46,586 --> 00:38:48,588
Yeah?
Compared it
to Lucinda Kemp.

00:38:48,588 --> 00:38:50,056
No familial match.

00:38:50,056 --> 00:38:51,491
It's not Adam.

00:38:51,491 --> 00:38:53,359
Are you sure
about that?
Yeah.

00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:55,361
'Cause I ran it
again myself.

00:38:55,361 --> 00:38:57,330
Her son's not our killer.

00:38:57,330 --> 00:39:00,467
So we're down
to the print.

00:39:00,467 --> 00:39:02,035
STOKES:
Moment of truth.

00:39:02,035 --> 00:39:03,536
(computer blips)

00:39:07,373 --> 00:39:09,242
That's our guy?

00:39:13,279 --> 00:39:15,782
What, not even
a courtesy call this time?

00:39:15,782 --> 00:39:17,717
Not this time.

00:39:25,592 --> 00:39:27,660
Perhaps we should have
this conversation

00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,128
in my office.
I think we

00:39:29,128 --> 00:39:30,663
should do it
down at the station.

00:39:40,373 --> 00:39:42,675
RUSSELL:
<i>First we thought this was</i>

00:39:42,675 --> 00:39:45,745
a picture of Lucinda Kemp,
but it's not, is it?

00:39:45,745 --> 00:39:48,648
It's your mother,
back when she was...

00:39:48,648 --> 00:39:51,284
young and healthy.
And beautiful.

00:39:51,284 --> 00:39:53,152
Before the cancer
took it all away.

00:39:53,152 --> 00:39:54,420
Hospital records show,

00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,322
uh, your mother
died at age 51.

00:39:56,322 --> 00:39:58,024
Yeah, but
I'm sure she looked

00:39:58,024 --> 00:40:00,360
a lot older by then--
a lot like Lucinda Kemp.

00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,762
That's when all this
started, isn't it?

00:40:02,762 --> 00:40:04,597
Lucinda came to you
for treatment,

00:40:04,597 --> 00:40:07,734
and it was like your
mother was coming back.

00:40:09,769 --> 00:40:11,271
Hey, Doc!

00:40:11,271 --> 00:40:13,139
We searched your house.

00:40:13,139 --> 00:40:14,541
We found the hair products.

00:40:14,541 --> 00:40:15,742
We found the makeup.

00:40:15,742 --> 00:40:18,011
Same brands
Lucinda uses.

00:40:18,011 --> 00:40:20,480
You washed her hair; you
helped her with her makeup.

00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,317
Must have been great
to have Mom back again, right?

00:40:24,317 --> 00:40:26,185
Right up until you didn't.
Until Jeffrey

00:40:26,185 --> 00:40:28,788
the wig guy gave her something
that her doctor couldn't.

00:40:28,788 --> 00:40:32,592
I wasn't just her doctor;
I was everything to her.

00:40:32,592 --> 00:40:34,060
Lean back...

00:40:41,134 --> 00:40:43,303
Yeah, but then
she left you, right?

00:40:43,303 --> 00:40:45,038
Just like your mother did?

00:40:45,038 --> 00:40:48,107
No, actually, not exactly
like your mother did.

00:40:48,107 --> 00:40:49,342
Because you didn't
put Lucinda

00:40:49,342 --> 00:40:51,244
out of her misery,
the way you did Mom.

00:40:51,244 --> 00:40:52,579
Found that in the
medical records, too.

00:40:52,579 --> 00:40:54,080
"Death by morphine
overdose."

00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:56,015
Hospital investigation
proved inconclusive,

00:40:56,015 --> 00:40:57,517
but you were interning

00:40:57,517 --> 00:41:00,186
at the same
hospital, right?

00:41:00,186 --> 00:41:01,654
Wow.

00:41:01,654 --> 00:41:02,789
You killed your mother.

00:41:02,789 --> 00:41:04,691
I ended her pain!

00:41:04,691 --> 00:41:06,359
Yeah.

00:41:06,359 --> 00:41:08,761
Just like you did
those other women--

00:41:08,761 --> 00:41:10,096
Eva...

00:41:10,096 --> 00:41:12,532
Joyce, Paula...

00:41:12,532 --> 00:41:15,735
All attempts to
recreate your mother.

00:41:15,735 --> 00:41:18,471
We found the hair
that you cut

00:41:18,471 --> 00:41:20,707
from all those women,
with the date and place

00:41:20,707 --> 00:41:22,041
when it was taken.

00:41:22,041 --> 00:41:24,143
You are a very meticulous...

00:41:24,143 --> 00:41:25,612
man, Dr. Ryan.

00:41:25,612 --> 00:41:27,313
You're kind of
a mama's boy, actually.

00:41:27,313 --> 00:41:28,615
Do you think you know me?!

00:41:28,615 --> 00:41:31,618
You don't know me at all.

00:41:37,056 --> 00:41:39,392
You know something?
You're right, I don't.

00:41:41,361 --> 00:41:43,396
I need to step out for a minute.

00:41:46,633 --> 00:41:48,601
You're done, Doc.

00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,022
Hey, Catherine.

00:42:09,022 --> 00:42:10,790
I didn't wake you up, did I?

00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:14,460
No, I know, I know,
I'm gonna go home in a minute.

00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:17,130
I'm just not quite
ready yet, you know?

00:42:18,364 --> 00:42:20,700
One of those days.

00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,468
No, we're fine, we're fine.

00:42:22,468 --> 00:42:26,172
Uh... my wife and I have
a little contract between us--

00:42:26,172 --> 00:42:29,475
there are certain things
I don't bring home from work.

00:42:30,543 --> 00:42:33,680
And, um...

00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,715
well, today, um...

00:42:38,785 --> 00:42:41,721
I lost one today, Catherine,

00:42:41,721 --> 00:42:43,589
and, uh...

00:42:43,589 --> 00:42:46,059
you know, I can't
stop seeing her-her face,

00:42:46,059 --> 00:42:48,561
and... can't stop
feeling like, you know,

00:42:48,561 --> 00:42:52,298
there's something I should have
done, you know, something more.

00:42:52,298 --> 00:42:54,133
No, I know, I know.

00:42:54,133 --> 00:42:55,368
I-I will, I will.

00:42:55,368 --> 00:42:57,670
It's, um...

00:42:57,670 --> 00:43:01,207
I just wanted to talk to you.

00:43:01,207 --> 00:43:02,442
Knew you'd understand.
