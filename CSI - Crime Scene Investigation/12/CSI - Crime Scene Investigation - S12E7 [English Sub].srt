00:00:07,961 --> 00:00:11,231
It's a simple proposal--
you, me,

00:00:11,231 --> 00:00:12,999
a bottle of Cristal.

00:00:12,999 --> 00:00:15,702
(beeping)

00:00:15,702 --> 00:00:17,871
I got to take this.

00:00:17,871 --> 00:00:19,239
Welcome to Tasty Time.

00:00:19,239 --> 00:00:21,074
Like to try
our new chocolate sundae?

00:00:21,074 --> 00:00:23,343
Hello?

00:00:23,343 --> 00:00:25,245
Come in, Houston.

00:00:25,245 --> 00:00:26,913
Tasty Time. Over.

00:00:26,913 --> 00:00:28,948
MAN:
Number 17.

00:00:28,948 --> 00:00:30,250
Okay.

00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:33,987
<i>Uno diecisiete</i> coming up.

00:00:33,987 --> 00:00:35,655
Want that monster-sized?

00:00:37,824 --> 00:00:40,360
I'll take that as a no.

00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,862
$6.43. Pull forward.

00:01:01,314 --> 00:01:02,949
Oh, very funny.

00:01:02,949 --> 00:01:05,151
Hey, who's gonna
pay for this?

00:01:07,821 --> 00:01:09,889
(truck horn blares, loud crash)

00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,943
So according to the
Tasty Time kid over here,

00:01:29,943 --> 00:01:31,678
this whole thing started

00:01:31,678 --> 00:01:33,246
when the convertible
just cruised through

00:01:33,246 --> 00:01:34,948
the fast food window.

00:01:34,948 --> 00:01:36,683
Got nailed by the truck.

00:01:36,683 --> 00:01:38,818
You know what they say,
fast food kills you.

00:01:38,818 --> 00:01:40,787
Not usually quite so fast.

00:01:40,787 --> 00:01:42,288
So the witnesses
at the burger joint said

00:01:42,288 --> 00:01:46,326
that the car seemed to be
on autopilot--no driver.

00:01:46,326 --> 00:01:48,862
STOKES: So maybe he had a
heart attack or an aneurysm

00:01:48,862 --> 00:01:50,830
and slumped over after ordering.

00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:52,832
Last supper,
favorite restaurant,

00:01:52,832 --> 00:01:54,667
didn't have a chance
to enjoy it.

00:01:54,667 --> 00:01:56,636
BRASS:
Yeah, the R.O. is Danny Clegg.

00:01:56,636 --> 00:01:58,805
He's got a long sheet--
burglary, assault

00:01:58,805 --> 00:02:00,039
possession, you know.

00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:02,876
What did he order?

00:02:02,876 --> 00:02:04,210
Why?

00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:05,712
Curious.

00:02:08,381 --> 00:02:11,284
He ordered a number 17--
triple cheeseburger deluxe.

00:02:11,284 --> 00:02:12,752
Okay.

00:02:12,752 --> 00:02:14,287
All right.

00:02:14,287 --> 00:02:18,725
So Jeep gets clipped by this
convertible--Mr. 17.

00:02:18,725 --> 00:02:21,194
Red paint transfer
from the convertible.

00:02:21,194 --> 00:02:25,298
Knocking him off-course
and into the light pole.

00:02:25,298 --> 00:02:28,134
The driver was ejected.
No seat belt.

00:02:28,134 --> 00:02:30,770
James Marshall,
20's, college kid.

00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:32,906
Second DUI this year.

00:02:32,906 --> 00:02:35,008
He was working on
this third here.

00:02:35,008 --> 00:02:36,976
Yeah, he got more than
a hangover this time.

00:02:36,976 --> 00:02:39,212
Well, this boy cracked his egg
wide open.

00:02:43,016 --> 00:02:45,285
RUSSELL:
What about our truck driver?

00:02:45,285 --> 00:02:49,022
BRASS: Okay, so the truck
hits the convertible,

00:02:49,022 --> 00:02:50,356
rolls on its side,

00:02:50,356 --> 00:02:52,158
leaving the driver speechless.

00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:04,771
Oh! All right, fellas,
we got a math problem here.

00:03:04,771 --> 00:03:06,172
Never very good at math.

00:03:06,172 --> 00:03:08,074
We got three dead
drivers, right?

00:03:08,074 --> 00:03:10,810
Right.
All with their brains
still inside their heads.

00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:12,178
Yeah. So?

00:03:12,178 --> 00:03:14,180
What's this brain
doing down here?

00:03:19,786 --> 00:03:21,154
This is going to be fun.

Sorry. I was just...

00:04:03,363 --> 00:04:04,998
No, no, no, no,
it's all good.

00:04:04,998 --> 00:04:06,632
I'm Nick Stokes.

00:04:06,632 --> 00:04:08,101
It's nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

00:04:08,101 --> 00:04:09,669
You're the same guy that's

00:04:09,669 --> 00:04:11,404
the starting point
guard at WLVU, right?

00:04:11,404 --> 00:04:13,072
Yeah.
Nice work.

00:04:13,072 --> 00:04:15,308
Are you, uh, are you here
for a family meeting?

00:04:15,308 --> 00:04:17,176
Dad's talked about
our family meetings?

00:04:17,176 --> 00:04:18,711
Well, they've been
pretty much

00:04:18,711 --> 00:04:20,279
dialed into the
curriculum around here.

00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,749
So is he serious about
raising your hand?

00:04:22,749 --> 00:04:25,018
Not anymore. No, we had
a family meeting about that.

00:04:25,018 --> 00:04:26,786
Hey, look who's here.

00:04:26,786 --> 00:04:27,987
Hey, buddy.
Hey.

00:04:27,987 --> 00:04:30,189
You met my son.

00:04:30,189 --> 00:04:31,724
Pretty cool, huh?

00:04:31,724 --> 00:04:33,226
What are you doing here?
I thought the bus

00:04:33,226 --> 00:04:35,661
to Tempe was leaving at 2:00.

00:04:35,661 --> 00:04:37,063
Yeah, it did.

00:04:38,364 --> 00:04:41,667
Oh, you have a game tonight?

00:04:41,667 --> 00:04:44,404
Which, clearly, you're not
going to make.

00:04:44,404 --> 00:04:46,706
Tell you what--
Mr. Russell,

00:04:46,706 --> 00:04:49,142
if you would call me
after you've read that.

00:04:49,142 --> 00:04:50,943
It's the DMV records
on all our vics.

00:04:50,943 --> 00:04:53,179
Clegg's the only one
with a rap sheet.

00:04:53,179 --> 00:04:54,947
It's good to meet
you, Charlie.

00:04:54,947 --> 00:04:57,116
Hey, I really look forward to
seeing you light it up, man.

00:04:57,116 --> 00:04:58,818
Thanks.
All right.

00:04:58,818 --> 00:05:00,086
All right.

00:05:00,086 --> 00:05:02,288
Talk to me.

00:05:02,288 --> 00:05:05,291
I missed curfew last night
by, like, five minutes.

00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:07,693
Coach suspended me for a game.
It's stupid.

00:05:07,693 --> 00:05:08,928
What's stupid?
You broke a rule.

00:05:08,928 --> 00:05:10,296
Technically, but Coach

00:05:10,296 --> 00:05:12,065
is a lot different
now that I'm recruited.

00:05:12,065 --> 00:05:13,733
He's a little Mussolini.

00:05:13,733 --> 00:05:15,668
Yeah, but the rules
didn't change, did they?

00:05:18,738 --> 00:05:20,706
All right.

00:05:20,706 --> 00:05:23,943
Stop by the house tonight
and we'll talk it through, okay?

00:05:26,712 --> 00:05:28,714
Hey, just for the record,

00:05:28,714 --> 00:05:31,818
exactly how long
is "like, five minutes"?

00:05:31,818 --> 00:05:35,288
Three hours, give or take.

00:05:43,296 --> 00:05:44,831
STOKES:
Got a cooler here.

00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,299
Maybe Clegg was drinking
and driving.

00:05:46,299 --> 00:05:47,967
Maybe.

00:05:52,004 --> 00:05:54,040
No booze.

00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,109
I don't know about
drinking and driving.

00:05:56,109 --> 00:05:57,710
More like thinking
and driving.

00:05:59,178 --> 00:06:01,080
Got some brain matter here.

00:06:02,148 --> 00:06:04,117
Hmm.

00:06:04,117 --> 00:06:08,921
Looks like Clegg might have been
transporting our mystery brain.

00:06:08,921 --> 00:06:10,189
You know, he could be
working for

00:06:10,189 --> 00:06:12,024
a medical company
or something like that.

00:06:12,024 --> 00:06:13,759
Well, he was definitely
into medicine,

00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,728
but I wouldn't trust him
to drive my brain around.

00:06:15,728 --> 00:06:16,929
Yeah? Why's that?

00:06:16,929 --> 00:06:18,764
Oxy.

00:06:18,764 --> 00:06:20,666
Oh.

00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:22,235
I got a duffle bag.

00:06:31,944 --> 00:06:33,179
Guy liked to work out.

00:06:35,314 --> 00:06:39,085
Huh.
He was into other lifting too.

00:06:39,085 --> 00:06:40,419
Got a burglary tool.

00:06:40,419 --> 00:06:41,854
I'm starting to get a picture

00:06:41,854 --> 00:06:44,624
of this Clegg guy.
Yeah, me too.

00:06:44,624 --> 00:06:46,826
There's some yellow powder
on the crowbar.

00:06:48,961 --> 00:06:52,665
Got some yellow powder
in the bag too.

00:06:52,665 --> 00:06:54,667
I have seen crappy cocaine
that color.

00:06:54,667 --> 00:06:56,969
I've never seen a drug addict
waste this much product.

00:06:59,372 --> 00:07:01,240
You know, we are down one body.

00:07:03,209 --> 00:07:05,978
Trunk's where I'd hide it.

00:07:05,978 --> 00:07:07,213
Yeah, pop it for me, will you?

00:07:12,118 --> 00:07:14,353
(sighs)

00:07:19,392 --> 00:07:22,028
SIDLE:
Pigskin?

00:07:22,028 --> 00:07:23,896
That's it?

00:07:23,896 --> 00:07:26,299
You know, this is strange.
Why?

00:07:26,299 --> 00:07:28,067
I'm starting to think
Russell's a psychic.

00:07:28,067 --> 00:07:29,669
How come?

00:07:29,669 --> 00:07:31,237
Well, 'cause he asked
what Clegg ordered

00:07:31,237 --> 00:07:32,939
at the drive-thru window.

00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:34,907
It was a number 17.

00:07:34,907 --> 00:07:37,276
Or it's a coincidence,
maybe.

00:07:37,276 --> 00:07:40,046
Mm...he hadn't opened
the trunk yet.

00:07:41,914 --> 00:07:44,917
HODGES:
(imitating traffic sounds)

00:07:44,917 --> 00:07:46,385
(imitating crash sounds)
Oh, no.

00:07:46,385 --> 00:07:47,853
(imitates tires squealing)

00:07:47,853 --> 00:07:49,121
(imitates person screaming)

00:07:49,121 --> 00:07:50,756
(imitates siren wailing)

00:07:50,756 --> 00:07:53,092
The police have arrived.
Thank God.

00:07:53,092 --> 00:07:55,728
(chuckles)
You...

00:07:55,728 --> 00:07:57,697
you have fun at work,
don't you?

00:07:57,697 --> 00:08:00,866
Some people are visual,
others are audio.

00:08:00,866 --> 00:08:03,402
I just happen to be both--
audio-visual.

00:08:03,402 --> 00:08:06,672
I like to process
the entire experience.

00:08:06,672 --> 00:08:09,675
RUSSELL: So the tire truck
smacks into the convertible,

00:08:09,675 --> 00:08:13,079
the convertible clips the Jeep,
and hello, light post.

00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:16,182
I have a theory
about that.

00:08:16,182 --> 00:08:18,718
Okay, so the brain is riding
shotgun in the cooler.

00:08:18,718 --> 00:08:20,286
(imitates car engine)

00:08:20,286 --> 00:08:22,788
Car gets smashed by the truck.
(imitates crash sounds)

00:08:22,788 --> 00:08:24,690
Cooler gets slammed
up against the door--

00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:27,260
doonk--and out pops our
magical mystery brain.

00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,961
(makes popping sound)
It's only defense

00:08:28,961 --> 00:08:30,730
was to roll under a tire.

00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:34,000
Hey, Russ, I found this
football in Clegg's trunk.

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,768
It's got a number 17 on it.

00:08:35,768 --> 00:08:37,403
Ha! I'll be damned.
Look at that.

00:08:37,403 --> 00:08:39,739
How'd you know that?

00:08:39,739 --> 00:08:41,407
What color is the horse?

00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:48,247
Really?
No, it's a famous story.

00:08:48,247 --> 00:08:50,783
A traffic accident
near a ranch, right?

00:08:50,783 --> 00:08:53,352
Several cars
and a horse are involved.

00:08:53,352 --> 00:08:56,355
The horse is severely injured
and the officer at the scene

00:08:56,355 --> 00:08:59,058
wants to put him
out of his misery with his .357.

00:08:59,058 --> 00:09:03,062
Unfortunately, the bullet
ricochets off the horse's skull

00:09:03,062 --> 00:09:05,064
and hits an officer
standing nearby.

00:09:05,064 --> 00:09:06,866
Kills him dead as a doornail.

00:09:06,866 --> 00:09:09,669
And when this is all
reported to the chief,

00:09:09,669 --> 00:09:13,372
the only question he asks,
"What color's the horse?"

00:09:13,372 --> 00:09:15,107
There were seasoned
investigators

00:09:15,107 --> 00:09:16,842
all over
that scene for hours,

00:09:16,842 --> 00:09:18,911
taking notes,
gathering evidence--

00:09:18,911 --> 00:09:22,214
but nobody noted
the color of the horse.

00:09:22,214 --> 00:09:23,983
If you miss one small detail,

00:09:23,983 --> 00:09:26,852
then who knows
what else you've missed.

00:09:26,852 --> 00:09:29,355
'Cause you never know
what's important.

00:09:29,355 --> 00:09:32,391
Cool story, huh?
That's a good story.

00:09:43,803 --> 00:09:48,040
Looks like Mr. Clegg swallowed
a couple oxycodones antemortem.

00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,209
Sara did find drugs
in is car.

00:09:50,209 --> 00:09:51,911
He's got a lot of
track marks.

00:09:51,911 --> 00:09:53,713
Clegg here was a junkie.

00:09:53,713 --> 00:09:55,881
Looks like
chicken nuggets.

00:09:55,881 --> 00:09:58,384
Takes two to four hours for
food to clear the stomach.

00:09:58,384 --> 00:10:02,054
This guy binged on fast food
before he ordered more.

00:10:02,054 --> 00:10:03,723
Equal opportunity junkie.

00:10:03,723 --> 00:10:05,358
Junkie being the operative word.

00:10:05,358 --> 00:10:08,694
I don't think Mr. Clegg died
as a result of the accident.

00:10:08,694 --> 00:10:13,199
Frothy edematous lungs,
pills, track marks--

00:10:13,199 --> 00:10:14,900
looks like an O.D.

00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:20,272
So what are we going
to do about the brain-topsy?

00:10:20,272 --> 00:10:22,074
To the scale, Ms. Brody.

00:10:22,074 --> 00:10:23,309
Weigh it.

00:10:23,309 --> 00:10:24,910
Oh, cool.

00:10:34,086 --> 00:10:36,155
3.4 pounds.

00:10:36,155 --> 00:10:37,857
That's heavy-ish.

00:10:37,857 --> 00:10:39,892
A female brain tips
the scales

00:10:39,892 --> 00:10:41,861
at probably 2.8-ish.

00:10:41,861 --> 00:10:44,130
Average male brain weighs
just over three pounds.

00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:45,965
Average female just under.

00:10:45,965 --> 00:10:47,166
So this brain's a boy.

00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:48,634
Well, DNA confirmed it.

00:10:48,634 --> 00:10:50,803
Didn't help us any
making the I.D.

00:10:50,803 --> 00:10:53,906
Hello, Brain Doe.

00:10:53,906 --> 00:10:55,141
So what's next?

00:10:55,141 --> 00:10:56,675
Check it for freshness,

00:10:56,675 --> 00:10:58,344
see if there are
any signs of decomp.

00:10:58,344 --> 00:11:01,680
BRODY: Mm-hmm... blood vessels
still look fairly red.

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,716
Go ahead, poke it.

00:11:03,716 --> 00:11:05,084
(laughs)
That's it.

00:11:05,084 --> 00:11:06,819
Feels like Jell-O.

00:11:06,819 --> 00:11:08,187
It's unfixed.

00:11:08,187 --> 00:11:10,322
No grossing or
formalin present.

00:11:10,322 --> 00:11:13,125
Means it was extracted
within the last 24 hours.

00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:16,328
Incision is precise,
brain stem's been cut clean.

00:11:16,328 --> 00:11:17,763
Skillfully removed.

00:11:17,763 --> 00:11:19,632
Cutter was a pro.

00:11:19,632 --> 00:11:20,933
Maybe a research specimen?

00:11:20,933 --> 00:11:22,768
No way.

00:11:22,768 --> 00:11:25,204
Specimens are immediately
fixed in formaldehyde.

00:11:25,204 --> 00:11:27,339
Oh.

00:11:27,339 --> 00:11:28,974
That's even more awesome.

00:11:28,974 --> 00:11:31,844
We might be talking about
black market brains.

00:11:31,844 --> 00:11:33,212
Thanks, Doc.

00:11:33,212 --> 00:11:35,414
This has been fun.

00:11:37,316 --> 00:11:40,252
Is it just me or are defense
attorneys getting smarter?

00:11:40,252 --> 00:11:42,855
Oh! No!
Slimier!

00:11:42,855 --> 00:11:44,890
Don't worry, we still have
the truth on our side.

00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:46,358
I still don't
like that guy.

00:11:46,358 --> 00:11:48,761
There was nothing wrong
with my evidence collection.

00:11:48,761 --> 00:11:50,930
At least he didn't ask you
if it was "Dr. Willows."

00:11:52,731 --> 00:11:55,701
(knocking)
Sanders. Willows.

00:11:55,701 --> 00:11:57,136
Coming or going?

00:11:57,136 --> 00:12:00,406
We are just returning
from court, Sheriff.

00:12:00,406 --> 00:12:03,642
Sanders, you look like you
could use a cup of coffee.

00:12:03,642 --> 00:12:04,777
(wry laugh)

00:12:07,012 --> 00:12:08,714
Nice seeing you too, Sheriff.

00:12:10,349 --> 00:12:12,051
You in the neighborhood?

00:12:12,051 --> 00:12:13,252
Not really.

00:12:15,421 --> 00:12:18,190
So, um...how are
things going?

00:12:19,792 --> 00:12:22,127
No complaints.
Really.

00:12:22,127 --> 00:12:24,330
I'd complain.

00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:26,332
You were a supervisor,
now you're not.

00:12:26,332 --> 00:12:28,400
No advancement
on the horizon.

00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,202
I'd be pissed.

00:12:30,202 --> 00:12:31,837
I work with some good people.

00:12:31,837 --> 00:12:34,139
It takes the sting off.

00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:36,108
Well, maybe I can do a
little better than that.

00:12:36,108 --> 00:12:37,877
I've been spending a lot
of time on the Hill.

00:12:37,877 --> 00:12:39,645
Senate Judiciary
Committee is exploring

00:12:39,645 --> 00:12:42,081
establishing a Forensic
Science Commission.

00:12:42,081 --> 00:12:45,117
They need a full-time staffer,
expert in the field.

00:12:45,117 --> 00:12:46,318
I recommended you.

00:12:48,387 --> 00:12:50,789
I hope you're good with that.

00:12:50,789 --> 00:12:53,692
Uh... wow.

00:12:53,692 --> 00:12:55,094
I don't know what to say.

00:12:55,094 --> 00:12:57,997
Do you really want to be
processing used condoms

00:12:57,997 --> 00:12:59,765
and dirty panties
the rest of your career?

00:13:01,066 --> 00:13:02,968
Go to D.C.

00:13:02,968 --> 00:13:05,104
Pay's good,
the hours are great.

00:13:05,104 --> 00:13:07,840
You get to travel.

00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,776
Sometimes you have to
move out to move up.

00:13:12,344 --> 00:13:14,747
If you're interested,
don't take too long.

00:13:14,747 --> 00:13:16,715
Thank you, Sheriff.
Thank you.

00:13:16,715 --> 00:13:18,083
I appreciate the confidence.

00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:20,119
It's not easy for us.

00:13:20,119 --> 00:13:22,121
Not in law enforcement.

00:13:22,121 --> 00:13:24,957
It's a... man's world.

00:13:29,862 --> 00:13:31,864
Ah. Sheriff.

00:13:31,864 --> 00:13:33,832
You here on business?

00:13:33,832 --> 00:13:35,134
Always.

00:13:38,671 --> 00:13:40,673
Hey, Catherine.

00:13:40,673 --> 00:13:42,408
Everything all right?

00:13:42,408 --> 00:13:44,109
Yeah.

00:13:44,109 --> 00:13:45,744
Why wouldn't it be?

00:13:45,744 --> 00:13:46,979
No reason.
No reason at all.

00:13:46,979 --> 00:13:49,214
Um, just got a call-out.

00:13:49,214 --> 00:13:51,951
A 406 at a mortuary. And you're
gonna love this part...

00:13:51,951 --> 00:13:56,388
comes with
an NRS 200.033.

00:13:56,388 --> 00:13:58,691
I have no idea
what the hell that is.

00:13:58,691 --> 00:14:00,793
You ever seen so many
numbers in a sentence before?

00:14:00,793 --> 00:14:03,128
Is this an assignment
or an observation?

00:14:03,128 --> 00:14:05,130
(cell phone rings)
Uh, yeah. Sorry. Both.

00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:08,067
Okay. Got it.
Russell.

00:14:08,067 --> 00:14:10,869
BRASS:
Only two brains were transported
in the last 24 hours.

00:14:10,869 --> 00:14:14,139
One belonged to Nora Babbit,
77, Alzheimer's patient.

00:14:14,139 --> 00:14:17,743
Her brain went to WLVU
Center for Gerontology.

00:14:17,743 --> 00:14:18,944
RUSSELL:
And the other one?

00:14:18,944 --> 00:14:21,080
Ryan Dempsey, 42, suicide.

00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,215
His brain went to
St. Sebastian's.

00:14:23,215 --> 00:14:25,084
Being studied for
repetitive trauma.

00:14:25,084 --> 00:14:27,019
So both the packages arrived?

00:14:27,019 --> 00:14:29,088
BRASS:
Safe and unsound.

00:14:29,088 --> 00:14:30,723
That's what I
call a dead end.

00:14:35,995 --> 00:14:38,697
Hey.
Hi, Lou.

00:14:38,697 --> 00:14:41,000
You okay?

00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,235
Why does everybody
keep asking me that?

00:14:43,235 --> 00:14:47,239
Okay... Lieutenant
Theodore Seligson, 30.

00:14:47,239 --> 00:14:48,774
On leave from Afghanistan.

00:14:48,774 --> 00:14:50,042
Cutting trees in his backyard.

00:14:50,042 --> 00:14:51,377
He fell and he broke his neck.

00:14:51,377 --> 00:14:53,912
Guy survived the war...
Yeah.

00:14:53,912 --> 00:14:55,781
Family's Jewish.
Now, they had to get him

00:14:55,781 --> 00:14:57,349
in the ground
by this morning.

00:14:57,349 --> 00:14:59,151
Someone is supposed to
remain with the body,

00:14:59,151 --> 00:15:00,686
but the mortuary night guy

00:15:00,686 --> 00:15:02,321
stayed with his girlfriend
last night instead.

00:15:02,321 --> 00:15:04,256
Came in this morning
and he called it in.

00:15:04,256 --> 00:15:05,858
That was Mrs. Seligson,
the widow.

00:15:05,858 --> 00:15:07,326
She came by as soon
as she heard.

00:15:07,326 --> 00:15:09,895
How bad is it?

00:15:09,895 --> 00:15:12,398
You need to see
for yourself.

00:15:12,398 --> 00:15:14,199
I didn't think corpses bled.

00:15:15,801 --> 00:15:17,770
Embalming is
considered desecration.

00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:19,672
Oh, really?

00:15:19,672 --> 00:15:23,308
What about cutting a guy's head
open and taking his brain?

00:15:26,845 --> 00:15:28,947
This guy was a war hero.

00:15:28,947 --> 00:15:31,383
I heard you guys found
a brain outside a Tasty Time.

00:15:31,383 --> 00:15:33,852
That's got to
be his, right?

00:15:33,852 --> 00:15:35,254
Well, it better be.

00:15:35,254 --> 00:15:36,755
Otherwise, we got
a brain collector

00:15:36,755 --> 00:15:38,023
on the loose in Vegas.

00:15:42,161 --> 00:15:44,630
(distant sirens wailing)

00:15:54,373 --> 00:15:56,008
Heard you could use
a little help.

00:15:56,008 --> 00:15:57,242
Yeah, thanks.

00:15:57,242 --> 00:15:58,677
Our mortuary owner

00:15:58,677 --> 00:16:00,179
said that when they
close at 10:00,

00:16:00,179 --> 00:16:03,916
the last thing they do
is mop the floors.

00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:06,351
These impressions have got
to belong to our brain thief.

00:16:06,351 --> 00:16:08,420
SIDLE:
You haven't heard.
Heard what?

00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:10,622
Henry ran the DNA
of our mystery brain

00:16:10,622 --> 00:16:13,792
against Lieutenant Seligson's
DNA in the military database.

00:16:13,792 --> 00:16:16,261
No match?

00:16:16,261 --> 00:16:18,630
Somebody breaks into a
mortuary and steals a brain.

00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:21,133
Meanwhile, across town,
another brain flies

00:16:21,133 --> 00:16:22,868
out of a convertible
during a TC.

00:16:22,868 --> 00:16:24,269
I mean, what are the odds?

00:16:24,269 --> 00:16:26,772
The two events
have to be related.

00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:36,281
This powder here
says that they are.

00:16:36,281 --> 00:16:38,283
<i>Nick and I processed</i>
<i>Clegg's car.</i>

00:16:38,283 --> 00:16:41,420
<i>We found a crowbar and yellow</i>
<i>powder that looked like this.</i>

00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,122
WILLOWS:
<i>So Clegg is the connection.</i>

00:16:43,122 --> 00:16:45,057
Maybe.

00:16:47,693 --> 00:16:49,261
WILLOWS:
Hodges.

00:16:49,261 --> 00:16:51,063
I'm sending you a photo
of a shoe impression.

00:16:51,063 --> 00:16:52,397
I need you to compare it to

00:16:52,397 --> 00:16:54,833
our convertible driver
Clegg's shoes.

00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:56,235
Coming at you.

00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,982
Perfect match.

00:17:09,982 --> 00:17:11,650
Clegg was definitely
at the mortuary.

00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:12,951
BRODY: And he'd
been there before.

00:17:12,951 --> 00:17:14,686
Clegg's employment records.

00:17:14,686 --> 00:17:16,355
Guy held down
a half-dozen odd jobs,

00:17:16,355 --> 00:17:18,757
including grave-shift
body pickups

00:17:18,757 --> 00:17:20,259
for mortuaries across town.

00:17:20,259 --> 00:17:22,961
His tox panel--
serious drug cocktail.

00:17:22,961 --> 00:17:25,931
Positive for oxycodone,
fentanyl, and DMT.

00:17:25,931 --> 00:17:27,299
What's DMT?
I don't know that.

00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:28,801
Di-Methyl-Triptamine.

00:17:28,801 --> 00:17:30,803
It's found in certain herbs.

00:17:30,803 --> 00:17:32,337
Creates a super-intense high

00:17:32,337 --> 00:17:35,641
that only lasts about two
minutes--instant painkiller.

00:17:35,641 --> 00:17:39,378
Okay, so, Clegg was intensely
high at both scenes--

00:17:39,378 --> 00:17:41,747
the brain snatching
and the traffic accident.

00:17:41,747 --> 00:17:43,949
But somewhere in between,
Seligson's brain

00:17:43,949 --> 00:17:46,718
is magically replaced
with our mystery brain--how?

00:17:46,718 --> 00:17:48,387
Well, we know the timeline.

00:17:48,387 --> 00:17:49,955
Clegg stole Seligson's brain

00:17:49,955 --> 00:17:52,758
sometime after 10:00 p.m.,
when he hit the mortuary,

00:17:52,758 --> 00:17:55,727
and sometime before 3:00 a.m.,
when he hit the drive-thru.

00:17:55,727 --> 00:17:57,629
With a new brain.

00:17:57,629 --> 00:17:59,364
So... oh, Lord.

00:17:59,364 --> 00:18:02,334
Um, all right, so...

00:18:02,334 --> 00:18:05,037
who's our mystery
brain belong to,

00:18:05,037 --> 00:18:08,307
and where did
Lt. Seligson's go?

00:18:08,307 --> 00:18:10,008
Chicken nuggets.

00:18:10,008 --> 00:18:11,343
Sorry?

00:18:11,343 --> 00:18:13,879
Doc found partially
digested chicken nuggets

00:18:13,879 --> 00:18:16,748
in Clegg's stomach--that means
he got some junk food

00:18:16,748 --> 00:18:18,884
at least two to three
hours before he OD'd.

00:18:18,884 --> 00:18:22,087
Okay, so, Clegg nuggeted up
around midnight.

00:18:22,087 --> 00:18:24,623
Maybe he switched brains then.
Well, if he did get the urge,

00:18:24,623 --> 00:18:27,059
then the best place
to go would be Tasty Time.

00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:29,094
Maybe that's where
he nuggeted up.

00:18:29,094 --> 00:18:31,630
So somebody needs to find
out how many Tasty Times

00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:33,398
there are in Vegas.
Twenty-two.

00:18:33,398 --> 00:18:35,701
Really?
I know it seems like a lot.

00:18:35,701 --> 00:18:37,936
At times, it feels
like it's not enough.

00:18:39,771 --> 00:18:41,907
Let's pull surveillance
from all of them.

00:18:41,907 --> 00:18:44,910
Let's just take Clegg's
car for a spin, shall we?

00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,049
Wow... this guy always
ordered chicken nuggets.

00:18:51,049 --> 00:18:52,784
SIDLE:
Not true.

00:18:52,784 --> 00:18:54,920
He ordered a number 17
triple cheeseburger deluxe

00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,421
right before he died.

00:18:56,421 --> 00:18:58,657
Yeah? Well, see what happens
when you break pattern?

00:19:02,027 --> 00:19:03,762
Oh, wait. Got it.

00:19:03,762 --> 00:19:06,098
Tasty Time on Altos Boulevard.

00:19:06,098 --> 00:19:07,866
11:53 p.m. last night.

00:19:07,866 --> 00:19:09,134
Oh, and guess what he ordered?

00:19:09,134 --> 00:19:10,335
Nuggets.

00:19:12,104 --> 00:19:13,238
SIDLE:
Clegg's car.

00:19:14,406 --> 00:19:16,108
He's meeting somebody.

00:19:16,108 --> 00:19:17,676
Think he's going
to share his nuggets?

00:19:19,044 --> 00:19:20,979
I think he's swapping brains.

00:19:20,979 --> 00:19:23,682
Explains how Clegg ended up
with our mystery brain.

00:19:23,682 --> 00:19:25,651
Volvo driver
gets Seligson's.

00:19:25,651 --> 00:19:27,252
Punch in on the plate.

00:19:36,194 --> 00:19:39,831
SIDLE:
Volvo's registered to
a Dr. Hanson Eller.

00:19:39,831 --> 00:19:41,266
Seneca address.

00:19:44,803 --> 00:19:47,639
Eller is
a private pathologist.

00:19:47,639 --> 00:19:49,908
Man would know how
to remove a brain.

00:19:49,908 --> 00:19:52,044
Maybe he took out
our mystery brain.

00:19:52,044 --> 00:19:53,812
Wait a second--Seneca.

00:19:53,812 --> 00:19:56,348
Two brains were
transported for research.

00:19:56,348 --> 00:19:59,284
One of them was
a suicide from Seneca.

00:20:02,788 --> 00:20:05,958
Here it is--the brain
belonged to Ryan Dempsey.

00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:09,227
Vegas local...he also
had a cabin in Seneca.

00:20:09,227 --> 00:20:11,063
The death certificate was signed

00:20:11,063 --> 00:20:13,165
by our pathologist,
Dr. Hanson Eller.

00:20:13,165 --> 00:20:15,033
Guy's a licensed doctor.

00:20:15,033 --> 00:20:16,868
What's he doing swapping
brains at midnight

00:20:16,868 --> 00:20:18,737
in a Tasty Time parking lot?

00:20:18,737 --> 00:20:20,872
I'll call Brass, have him
put a broadcast out on Eller.

00:20:20,872 --> 00:20:23,208
SANDERS: Somebody should break
the news to the Dempsey family.

00:20:24,743 --> 00:20:26,244
JOYCE DEMPSEY:
<i>You're wrong.</i>

00:20:26,244 --> 00:20:29,081
My husband's instructions
were very specific.

00:20:29,081 --> 00:20:31,984
And I got a call from
St. Sebastian's this morning.

00:20:31,984 --> 00:20:33,385
His brain arrived.

00:20:33,385 --> 00:20:35,721
Yeah. <i>A</i> brain arrived.

00:20:35,721 --> 00:20:38,390
We don't believe that
it was your husband's.

00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:40,192
Well, how could that be?

00:20:40,192 --> 00:20:42,027
Well, that's what we're
trying to figure out.

00:20:42,027 --> 00:20:45,364
Did your husband donate all
of his organs to research?

00:20:45,364 --> 00:20:48,033
No, just his brain.

00:20:48,033 --> 00:20:50,102
Ryan...

00:20:50,102 --> 00:20:52,671
thought he had C.T.E.

00:20:52,671 --> 00:20:54,940
Chronic Traumatic Encephalitis.

00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:57,409
My husband was a mixed
marital arts fighter.

00:20:57,409 --> 00:20:59,778
If you've ever seen
an S.F.F. match,

00:20:59,778 --> 00:21:01,646
you know the beatings
those guys take.

00:21:03,782 --> 00:21:07,853
JOYCE: <i>Ryan took a lot of hits</i>
<i>over the years.</i>

00:21:07,853 --> 00:21:09,955
<i>Concussions.</i>

00:21:09,955 --> 00:21:11,323
<i>But he always</i>
<i>fought through it.</i>

00:21:15,861 --> 00:21:17,863
Said he was doing it for us.

00:21:24,169 --> 00:21:26,671
(clears throat)

00:21:26,671 --> 00:21:32,010
A year ago, he started having
problems with his memory.

00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:35,680
You know, he'd get confused...

00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,948
upset...

00:21:36,948 --> 00:21:39,351
And when he got upset, he...

00:21:42,988 --> 00:21:45,957
Things could get bad.

00:21:45,957 --> 00:21:48,627
Right.

00:21:48,627 --> 00:21:50,362
(rock music
playing over ear buds)

00:21:56,134 --> 00:21:57,836
It's okay.

00:22:01,873 --> 00:22:03,642
Hey, kid.

00:22:07,879 --> 00:22:09,381
You're Declan, right?

00:22:09,381 --> 00:22:11,149
Ryan Dempsey's boy.

00:22:11,149 --> 00:22:13,051
I'm Jim Brass.

00:22:13,051 --> 00:22:14,886
I heard about your dad.

00:22:14,886 --> 00:22:17,222
And you're sorry for my loss?

00:22:17,222 --> 00:22:19,791
Yeah, I am.

00:22:22,127 --> 00:22:24,229
The thing about CTE is,

00:22:24,229 --> 00:22:25,997
they don't know
if you have it

00:22:25,997 --> 00:22:27,833
until after you're dead.

00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:31,002
You know, they--they
study your brain.

00:22:31,002 --> 00:22:32,137
(sniffles)

00:22:34,773 --> 00:22:36,241
(voice breaks):
Even killing himself,

00:22:36,241 --> 00:22:37,976
all he could think about was

00:22:37,976 --> 00:22:42,147
making sure his brain
could be studied.

00:22:42,147 --> 00:22:43,849
How crazy is that?

00:22:43,849 --> 00:22:45,684
I'm sorry to ask you this,
Mrs. Dempsey,

00:22:45,684 --> 00:22:48,353
but can you walk me through
what happened

00:22:48,353 --> 00:22:49,988
right after the suicide?

00:22:51,623 --> 00:22:54,092
It was the worst night
of my life.

00:22:56,027 --> 00:22:59,865
My son and I
had been out hiking.

00:22:59,865 --> 00:23:02,901
Ryan wasn't feeling well.

00:23:02,901 --> 00:23:05,737
And when we got back
to the cabin...

00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:09,841
...we found him.

00:23:09,841 --> 00:23:11,943
I didn't know what to do,
so I called,

00:23:11,943 --> 00:23:14,713
um... a family friend.

00:23:14,713 --> 00:23:16,314
Who was that?

00:23:16,314 --> 00:23:19,885
It was Ryan's trainer,
Bill Pernin.

00:23:19,885 --> 00:23:21,153
He made the arrangements?

00:23:21,153 --> 00:23:23,421
He called the pathologist,
Dr. Eller?

00:23:23,421 --> 00:23:25,157
I--I suppose so.

00:23:25,157 --> 00:23:27,392
Did you talk with Dr. Eller?

00:23:27,392 --> 00:23:32,130
The man who was gonna remove
my husband's brain?

00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:34,099
I didn't care to meet him.

00:23:34,099 --> 00:23:36,401
No, of course not.

00:23:39,171 --> 00:23:41,173
Did you get along
with your Dad?

00:23:41,173 --> 00:23:44,209
You get along
with yours?

00:23:44,209 --> 00:23:46,244
No.

00:23:46,244 --> 00:23:48,146
Took a belt to me.

00:23:48,146 --> 00:23:50,348
Tough.

00:23:50,348 --> 00:23:51,850
He was a cop too.

00:23:54,653 --> 00:23:57,055
He was not a happy guy.

00:23:57,055 --> 00:23:59,024
I was, like, 15 before
I had the balls

00:23:59,024 --> 00:24:00,392
to belt him back.

00:24:00,392 --> 00:24:02,093
I popped him in the jaw.

00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:06,898
I could tell it hurt too.

00:24:06,898 --> 00:24:08,733
Never felt better.

00:24:08,733 --> 00:24:10,135
I never felt worse.

00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:13,872
How 'bout your Mom?

00:24:13,872 --> 00:24:15,006
She get along
with your Dad?

00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:19,945
Let's go, Deck.

00:24:24,049 --> 00:24:25,784
Wife had bruising.

00:24:25,784 --> 00:24:27,018
Mm.

00:24:27,018 --> 00:24:29,020
Yeah, the kid's
awfully quiet.

00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,388
I'll do some checking.

00:24:30,388 --> 00:24:32,824
See if there were any
domestic violence calls.

00:24:32,824 --> 00:24:34,092
Call Seneca P.D.

00:24:34,092 --> 00:24:36,962
They had a family cabin
up there.

00:24:36,962 --> 00:24:39,664
Vacations can be stressful.

00:24:39,664 --> 00:24:40,899
I wouldn't know.

00:24:40,899 --> 00:24:42,133
(phone ringing)
Aw...

00:24:42,133 --> 00:24:43,335
Hold on.

00:24:43,335 --> 00:24:46,171
Brass.

00:24:46,171 --> 00:24:48,707
Where?

00:24:48,707 --> 00:24:50,342
Okay, lock it down
till we get there.

00:24:50,342 --> 00:24:53,144
Dr. Eller's car
just showed up.

00:24:53,144 --> 00:24:55,046
I'll send Nick.

00:25:02,921 --> 00:25:04,723
What do we know?

00:25:04,723 --> 00:25:06,791
Security heard shots fired
less than 30 minutes ago.

00:25:06,791 --> 00:25:08,126
No surveillance.

00:25:08,126 --> 00:25:09,661
Yeah, and no witnesses.

00:25:09,661 --> 00:25:11,096
Found the vehicle
just like this,

00:25:11,096 --> 00:25:13,732
backed into the space
with the windows down.

00:25:13,732 --> 00:25:15,734
Hmm, looks
like a meet.

00:25:15,734 --> 00:25:17,369
Yeah, and it wasn't
his first.

00:25:17,369 --> 00:25:19,004
We got him on tape
at Tasty Time

00:25:19,004 --> 00:25:20,739
trading brains with Clegg.

00:25:23,308 --> 00:25:26,645
It's a single GSW to the left
temple through and through.

00:25:26,645 --> 00:25:28,647
Bullet's in the headliner.

00:25:28,647 --> 00:25:30,315
Slight upward angle.

00:25:30,315 --> 00:25:32,984
Now...unless the shooter's
four feet tall...

00:25:32,984 --> 00:25:38,089
the car pulled up right
alongside of him, right here.

00:25:38,089 --> 00:25:40,825
Dips out
of the driver's-side window

00:25:40,825 --> 00:25:42,394
and bam!

00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:47,098
(shell casing clinks)

00:25:52,304 --> 00:25:54,339
Nine millimeter.

00:25:54,339 --> 00:25:57,375
We know Eller and Clegg had some
kind of business arrangement.

00:25:57,375 --> 00:25:59,678
Well, maybe some third party
wanted a share

00:25:59,678 --> 00:26:00,879
of their brain game.

00:26:00,879 --> 00:26:02,213
Yeah, a silent partner.

00:26:02,213 --> 00:26:04,316
Who silenced Eller.

00:26:09,888 --> 00:26:11,890
Dr. Eller
delivered this brain

00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:14,225
to the hospital under
the name Ryan Dempsey.

00:26:14,225 --> 00:26:17,395
But DNA has confirmed that
the brain is not Dempsey's.

00:26:17,395 --> 00:26:20,198
In fact, it's
Lieutenant Seligson's.

00:26:20,198 --> 00:26:22,233
Couldn't pick him out
in a crowd.

00:26:22,233 --> 00:26:23,835
I beg to differ.

00:26:23,835 --> 00:26:25,036
Care to elaborate?

00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:31,910
Take a look at that
butchered brain stem.

00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:33,712
ROBBINS:
This brain's a hack job.

00:26:35,747 --> 00:26:39,117
But Dempsey's brain, the one
they found at the accident,

00:26:39,117 --> 00:26:41,786
was surgically removed
by a qualified surgeon.

00:26:41,786 --> 00:26:44,055
Hack job on
Lieutenant Seligson's brain

00:26:44,055 --> 00:26:45,890
suggests that the cuts
were made in a hurry,

00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:48,159
maybe even improvised.

00:26:49,694 --> 00:26:51,196
Which can only mean one thing...

00:26:51,196 --> 00:26:52,731
RUSSELL:
<i>So you're saying</i>

00:26:52,731 --> 00:26:54,265
that somebody wanted
a brain in a hurry,

00:26:54,265 --> 00:26:56,301
so they broke into the mortuary

00:26:56,301 --> 00:26:58,336
and hacked out
Lieutenant Seligson's?

00:26:58,336 --> 00:27:00,238
Ryan Dempsey
commits suicide.

00:27:00,238 --> 00:27:02,707
He's convinced he's got
a degenerative brain disorder,

00:27:02,707 --> 00:27:04,876
so he donates
his brain to science.

00:27:04,876 --> 00:27:07,145
But Clegg swaps it out
so it can't be studied.

00:27:07,145 --> 00:27:09,114
Giving him a brain upgrade
in the process.

00:27:09,114 --> 00:27:10,849
Upgrade?

00:27:10,849 --> 00:27:12,817
That's why Clegg chose
Seligson's brain.

00:27:12,817 --> 00:27:14,419
Lieutenant Seligson was Jewish.

00:27:14,419 --> 00:27:18,022
And Jewish tradition says
a body can't be embalmed.

00:27:18,022 --> 00:27:20,925
Preferably it goes
in the ground within 24 hours.

00:27:20,925 --> 00:27:23,361
So the Lieutenant's
brain was fresh.

00:27:23,361 --> 00:27:25,864
Just what St. Sebastian's
was expecting.

00:27:25,864 --> 00:27:27,098
A perfect specimen.

00:27:27,098 --> 00:27:28,333
No chemicals, no decomp.

00:27:28,333 --> 00:27:30,101
No brain disease.

00:27:30,101 --> 00:27:33,138
Okay, so Ryan Dempsey wanted
to have his brain studied

00:27:33,138 --> 00:27:35,306
'cause he was afraid
he had CTE

00:27:35,306 --> 00:27:37,375
and he wanted
the truth to come out.

00:27:37,375 --> 00:27:39,844
And clearly someone else didn't.

00:27:39,844 --> 00:27:42,313
Someone who was willing
to grave rob, brain swap,

00:27:42,313 --> 00:27:43,782
and pop a pathologist

00:27:43,782 --> 00:27:45,049
to cover it all up.

00:27:45,049 --> 00:27:46,818
The silent partner.

00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,956
Hodges, what are you doing?

00:27:51,956 --> 00:27:54,092
Um, it's a break room.

00:27:54,092 --> 00:27:55,293
I'm on a break.

00:27:55,293 --> 00:27:56,861
You know chickens' nuggets

00:27:56,861 --> 00:27:58,396
don't really look
like that, right?

00:27:58,396 --> 00:28:00,231
Please don't ruin my lunch..

00:28:00,231 --> 00:28:03,268
Fine. Uh, yellow powder trace?
Give.

00:28:03,268 --> 00:28:04,969
Receive.

00:28:04,969 --> 00:28:06,171
You know,
I've been trying

00:28:06,171 --> 00:28:08,239
to text you
for over an hour.

00:28:12,143 --> 00:28:13,978
Talcum powder.

00:28:13,978 --> 00:28:16,181
HODGES: <i>In Clegg's duffel bag,</i>
<i>on the crowbar,</i>

00:28:16,181 --> 00:28:18,016
<i>at the mortuary.</i>

00:28:18,016 --> 00:28:20,985
In my report, powder's made
with a special formulation

00:28:20,985 --> 00:28:23,888
with five essential oils,
used in high-end gyms,

00:28:23,888 --> 00:28:25,723
including my own.

00:28:25,723 --> 00:28:27,792
You go to the gym?
Mm-hmm.

00:28:27,792 --> 00:28:29,194
Under this shirt...

00:28:29,194 --> 00:28:31,095
ripped.

00:28:31,095 --> 00:28:33,865
Oh, I--I believe you.

00:28:33,865 --> 00:28:36,134
Page four--
it's a list of gyms.

00:28:36,134 --> 00:28:38,069
Not even
real chicken in there.

00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,075
Ryan Dempsey.
"The Man Without Fear."

00:28:44,075 --> 00:28:46,878
Pretty good record:
52 and nine.

00:28:46,878 --> 00:28:48,713
Ooh, that looks
like one of the nine.

00:28:48,713 --> 00:28:52,283
SANDERS: Yeah, and that...
looks like Danny Clegg.

00:28:52,283 --> 00:28:54,118
The guy who had Dempsey's brain
in his convertible?

00:28:54,118 --> 00:28:55,320
They knew each other.

00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,754
They were in
the S.F.F. together.

00:28:56,754 --> 00:28:58,323
They trained together
until Clegg got

00:28:58,323 --> 00:28:59,991
kicked out of
the league for drugs.

00:28:59,991 --> 00:29:02,093
Well, that powder
in Clegg's gym bag

00:29:02,093 --> 00:29:06,764
was a specific type of talc
used at certain gyms.

00:29:06,764 --> 00:29:08,833
"Bill Pernin's Power Center."

00:29:08,833 --> 00:29:10,068
It's on the list.

00:29:12,003 --> 00:29:14,305
Dempsey's widow said
Bill Pernin was his trainer.

00:29:14,305 --> 00:29:16,307
And he's the family friend
who made arrangements

00:29:16,307 --> 00:29:18,009
for Dempsey's brain.

00:29:18,009 --> 00:29:20,912
Yeah, that connects him
to Dempsey, Clegg and Dr. Eller.

00:29:20,912 --> 00:29:22,780
Pernin just signed
a multi-million-dollar

00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,148
deal with Real Fuel?

00:29:24,148 --> 00:29:26,117
One of his fighters
turning up with CTE

00:29:26,117 --> 00:29:27,819
cannot be good for advertising.

00:29:27,819 --> 00:29:30,722
[all grunting and panting]

00:30:01,085 --> 00:30:02,654
Bill Pernin?

00:30:02,654 --> 00:30:03,821
Yeah. Can I help you?

00:30:03,821 --> 00:30:04,956
You got a minute?

00:30:06,391 --> 00:30:08,726
Yeah.

00:30:08,726 --> 00:30:10,061
Do a couple rounds
of shadow boxing.

00:30:10,061 --> 00:30:11,729
Good work.

00:30:11,729 --> 00:30:13,197
Let me guess, you two are here

00:30:13,197 --> 00:30:15,967
about the Real Fuel Couple's
Boot Camp, huh?

00:30:15,967 --> 00:30:17,835
Ah, it's gonna be
a terrific weekend.

00:30:17,835 --> 00:30:19,137
Sara Sidle.
Greg Sanders.

00:30:19,137 --> 00:30:20,705
We're with the Crime Lab.

00:30:20,705 --> 00:30:22,874
SANDERS: Can we talk
somewhere out of the way?

00:30:27,145 --> 00:30:28,746
Yeah.

00:30:28,746 --> 00:30:30,148
Nice facility.

00:30:30,148 --> 00:30:33,084
Oh, thanks, man.
It's my dream.

00:30:33,084 --> 00:30:35,653
You know, 20 years
of blood, sweat and tears.

00:30:35,653 --> 00:30:37,055
So, uh, what's up?

00:30:37,055 --> 00:30:38,756
You guys aren't here
to hit the heavy bag.

00:30:38,756 --> 00:30:40,024
What's going on?

00:30:40,024 --> 00:30:41,392
We're here about
Dr. Hanson Eller.

00:30:41,392 --> 00:30:42,994
The, uh, pathologist.

00:30:42,994 --> 00:30:44,796
Yeah, he used to train
at my old gym.

00:30:44,796 --> 00:30:46,631
You hired him
to remove

00:30:46,631 --> 00:30:49,300
your friend
Ryan Dempsey's brain?

00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,135
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

00:30:51,135 --> 00:30:53,671
His wife asked me to help
with the funeral arrangements.

00:30:53,671 --> 00:30:54,939
I don't think those were

00:30:54,939 --> 00:30:56,908
the arrangements
that she had in mind.

00:30:56,908 --> 00:30:58,910
What are you talking about?

00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:01,112
We're talking about how your
friend Ryan Dempsey's brain

00:31:01,112 --> 00:31:04,148
ended up in your other friend
Danny Clegg's cooler.

00:31:04,148 --> 00:31:06,250
Okay... look, I'm still
not following you.

00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:08,019
Eller, Dempsey, Clegg--

00:31:08,019 --> 00:31:09,954
the only thing these three guys
had in common,

00:31:09,954 --> 00:31:13,725
other than your training,
is that they're all dead.

00:31:13,725 --> 00:31:15,126
Wow.

00:31:15,126 --> 00:31:16,961
Look, if something happened
to Danny Clegg

00:31:16,961 --> 00:31:18,630
and Dr. Eller,
that's news to me.

00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:20,164
When's the last time
you saw them?

00:31:20,164 --> 00:31:21,933
I haven't seen Danny
in months.

00:31:21,933 --> 00:31:24,636
Poor guy was a junkie.
I had to toss him out of here.

00:31:24,636 --> 00:31:27,639
And Dr. Eller--the last
time we saw each other,

00:31:27,639 --> 00:31:29,140
I was crying
over my friend's body.

00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,908
If you'll excuse me,
I got about

00:31:30,908 --> 00:31:32,710
three different meetings
that I'm late for.

00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:34,278
So if you need me,
my number's on the wall.

00:31:34,278 --> 00:31:36,280
Other than that,
great meeting you.

00:31:39,117 --> 00:31:41,386
Would you buy a membership
off that guy?

00:31:41,386 --> 00:31:43,187
Not a lifetime one.

00:31:46,024 --> 00:31:48,326
Well, I don't think
I am overreacting.

00:31:48,326 --> 00:31:51,696
Yeah, he lied to his coach,
then he lied to me.

00:31:51,696 --> 00:31:53,865
It's not just about basketball.

00:31:53,865 --> 00:31:56,034
It's about life.

00:31:56,034 --> 00:31:57,669
Yeah, you say that whenever

00:31:57,669 --> 00:31:58,970
you're trying to get
off the phone,

00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:01,139
so I'm gonna get
off the phone first.

00:32:01,139 --> 00:32:02,273
I love you too.

00:32:03,675 --> 00:32:05,410
You rang?

00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:07,011
Yeah. I ran my theory on

00:32:07,011 --> 00:32:08,746
the domestic troubles
with the Dempseys.

00:32:08,746 --> 00:32:10,348
Came up empty.

00:32:10,348 --> 00:32:12,717
You didn't call me over here
just to tell me that...

00:32:12,717 --> 00:32:13,918
did you?

00:32:13,918 --> 00:32:16,320
No. Look at these.

00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,256
These are photos
of Ryan Dempsey's suicide.

00:32:18,256 --> 00:32:19,657
Gun on the floor.

00:32:19,657 --> 00:32:21,192
Half a bottle of
bourbon in front of him.

00:32:21,192 --> 00:32:22,627
It took the investigator

00:32:22,627 --> 00:32:24,829
just 20 minutes
to call it.

00:32:24,829 --> 00:32:26,230
Do you see what I don't see?

00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:27,832
Yeah, I do.

00:32:27,832 --> 00:32:30,668
No gunshot residue
on the guy's T-shirt.

00:32:30,668 --> 00:32:32,403
Gun had to be at least
three feet away.

00:32:32,403 --> 00:32:34,338
That's pretty tricky
for a suicide.

00:32:34,338 --> 00:32:37,208
Even a 36-inch sleeve
couldn't pull that off.

00:32:39,977 --> 00:32:41,212
Ryan Dempsey was murdered.

00:32:46,684 --> 00:32:49,954
All right, let's start by
getting our own brains straight.

00:32:49,954 --> 00:32:52,657
Now that the smoke and tires
have cleared, what do we know--

00:32:52,657 --> 00:32:54,358
really know--for sure.

00:32:54,358 --> 00:32:58,229
Well, we've got Ryan Dempsey,
an S.F.F. fighter murdered,

00:32:58,229 --> 00:32:59,864
staged to look like a suicide.

00:32:59,864 --> 00:33:01,666
Cops found a .38 special
near the body

00:33:01,666 --> 00:33:03,067
with Dempsey's
prints on it.

00:33:03,067 --> 00:33:05,103
Per his will, Dempsey's
brain was on its way

00:33:05,103 --> 00:33:06,370
to being studied for CTE.

00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:08,673
Except somebody
intercepted it

00:33:08,673 --> 00:33:10,942
and substituted another
healthy brain.

00:33:10,942 --> 00:33:13,344
Enlisting Danny Clegg,
who OD'd.

00:33:13,344 --> 00:33:14,879
And Doc Eller,
who was shot to death.

00:33:14,879 --> 00:33:16,347
RUSSELL:
Why?

00:33:16,347 --> 00:33:17,982
I mean, let's say
that the brain did get

00:33:17,982 --> 00:33:19,250
to where it's supposed to go.

00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:21,686
It was studied
and Dempsey had CTE.

00:33:21,686 --> 00:33:23,321
So what?
I mean, wouldn't that be on him?

00:33:23,321 --> 00:33:26,157
Pernin would still not want to
have been associated with that.

00:33:26,157 --> 00:33:29,093
Yeah, but enough
to kill for?

00:33:29,093 --> 00:33:31,329
Maybe Dempsey's brain's
hiding another secret?

00:33:31,329 --> 00:33:32,830
Keep going.

00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:34,665
Well, according
to Clegg's tox panel,

00:33:34,665 --> 00:33:36,768
he OD'd on quite
the drug cocktail,

00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:37,969
including DMT, right?

00:33:37,969 --> 00:33:39,804
The instant painkiller.

00:33:39,804 --> 00:33:43,007
Yeah, maybe the perfect lift to
get him through a tough fight.

00:33:43,007 --> 00:33:45,209
Pernin could be doping
his fighters.

00:33:45,209 --> 00:33:47,779
Now, that might be worth
covering up.

00:33:47,779 --> 00:33:49,881
And also worth killing for.

00:33:49,881 --> 00:33:51,816
You know something?
I bet that Dempsey's brain

00:33:51,816 --> 00:33:53,084
might corroborate all of this,

00:33:53,084 --> 00:33:55,119
if we could just get it
to pee in a cup.

Well, you have
a medical background.

00:34:43,034 --> 00:34:45,903
Yeah, in sports medicine.
You know what DMT is?

00:34:45,903 --> 00:34:49,841
Schedule One drug--they don't
test for that in the S.F.F.

00:34:49,841 --> 00:34:51,409
This report tells us
that Ryan Dempsey

00:34:51,409 --> 00:34:54,212
was taking DMT,
as was Danny Clegg.

00:34:54,212 --> 00:34:57,081
Although I suspect that Clegg
was using it recreationally.

00:34:57,081 --> 00:34:59,650
A little bump
from his old trainer

00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:01,986
for doing him a solid.

00:35:01,986 --> 00:35:04,121
Why, why am I here, exactly?

00:35:04,121 --> 00:35:06,090
Well, you made a
phone call to Danny Clegg

00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:07,658
the night that
Dempsey died.

00:35:07,658 --> 00:35:09,227
Yeah, Clegg is
an old friend of mine.

00:35:09,227 --> 00:35:11,662
I got his number in my phone.
Pocket dial.

00:35:11,662 --> 00:35:13,698
What do you want?
Oh, you pocket dialing

00:35:13,698 --> 00:35:16,033
the Dempsey home for
the last four months too?

00:35:16,033 --> 00:35:17,802
I was his trainer.

00:35:17,802 --> 00:35:20,905
Exactly. So why were you calling
when Ryan was at the gym?

00:35:20,905 --> 00:35:22,406
His wife was not
hard on the eyes.

00:35:22,406 --> 00:35:25,243
Were you tuning
her up too?

00:35:25,243 --> 00:35:27,879
And Dempsey found out
about it, right?

00:35:27,879 --> 00:35:29,680
Why'd you do this to me?
See the doctor...

00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,315
You didn't think
I'd find out?!
Stop it...!

called you right after.

00:35:41,325 --> 00:35:43,861
According to the phone records,
you were still in Vegas.

00:35:43,861 --> 00:35:47,131
Two hours after that, you made
a call to Dr. Eller

00:35:47,131 --> 00:35:49,934

Now I get to make another call.

00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:09,820
(acoustic guitar strumming)

00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,155
Hey.

00:36:11,155 --> 00:36:13,858
Hey, you remember
this one, Dad?

00:36:13,858 --> 00:36:16,060
As a matter of fact, I do.

00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:18,829
♪ ♪

00:36:18,829 --> 00:36:22,199
Trying to soften me up,
are you?

00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:23,401
Is it working?

00:36:23,401 --> 00:36:25,836
No.

00:36:25,836 --> 00:36:28,005
Your coach called me
this afternoon.

00:36:28,005 --> 00:36:30,107
He's worried about you.
He's worried about winning.

00:36:30,107 --> 00:36:33,044
Well, he's supposed to, Charlie.
He's the coach.

00:36:34,712 --> 00:36:36,814
So why did you miss curfew?

00:36:36,814 --> 00:36:38,416
I was bouldering
up at Mt. Charleston.

00:36:38,416 --> 00:36:40,184
I lost track of time.
It was stupid.

00:36:40,184 --> 00:36:41,686
I don't care
what you were doing.

00:36:41,686 --> 00:36:43,054
I want to know why, Charlie.

00:36:44,956 --> 00:36:47,024
It's just...

00:36:47,024 --> 00:36:48,392
the other players don't
really get me.

00:36:50,061 --> 00:36:51,729
It's different here, Dad.

00:36:55,866 --> 00:36:57,201
Hey, you're the new kid
on the team.

00:36:57,201 --> 00:36:59,303
Everybody thinks
you're a little weird.

00:36:59,303 --> 00:37:00,871
Right?

00:37:00,871 --> 00:37:03,641
Well, join the club.

00:37:03,641 --> 00:37:05,142
(chuckles)

00:37:05,142 --> 00:37:06,944
We are weird.

00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:08,279
(both laughing)

00:37:11,849 --> 00:37:14,652
Are you still having fun
with basketball?

00:37:14,652 --> 00:37:16,287
I love it.
Good.

00:37:16,287 --> 00:37:18,823
Apologize to your coach...

00:37:18,823 --> 00:37:21,392
take your suspension
with a smile,

00:37:21,392 --> 00:37:24,161
and, next game,
you bring it.

00:37:24,161 --> 00:37:26,063
Can you do that?

00:37:26,063 --> 00:37:29,000
Yeah, I can do that.

00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,335
Good.

00:37:38,342 --> 00:37:40,044
Whew...

00:37:41,712 --> 00:37:43,381
Hey, come here for a second,
will you?

00:37:43,381 --> 00:37:45,082
I promise, I promise,

00:37:45,082 --> 00:37:46,384
no more stories.

00:37:46,384 --> 00:37:48,152
(chuckles)

00:37:48,152 --> 00:37:49,687
Okay, what's up?

00:37:49,687 --> 00:37:51,255
This is driving
me crazy.

00:37:51,255 --> 00:37:54,892
Now, why did Clegg
order a number 17?

00:37:54,892 --> 00:37:56,994
Right?
He was a nugget man.

00:37:56,994 --> 00:37:59,730
He's high on drugs--he should
have been thirsty, if anything.

00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:01,399
Well, you know what's
driving me nuts?
What?

00:38:01,399 --> 00:38:02,800
That football.

00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,168
Why?

00:38:04,168 --> 00:38:05,736
'Cause I played
a little football.

00:38:05,736 --> 00:38:07,204
I even got a game ball once.

00:38:07,204 --> 00:38:09,073
They put my jersey number
on it and everything.

00:38:09,073 --> 00:38:11,842
And I still have that football;
it's very important to me.

00:38:11,842 --> 00:38:13,711
Maybe this is
Clegg's game ball, right?

00:38:13,711 --> 00:38:16,347
And he hung on to it, and his
life is passing before his eyes.

00:38:16,347 --> 00:38:18,249
He starts thinking
about the good times.

00:38:18,249 --> 00:38:20,384
I don't know, man.
I read Clegg's bio.

00:38:20,384 --> 00:38:21,919
He didn't even
play football.

00:38:21,919 --> 00:38:23,120
Yeah, but Dempsey did.

00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:26,023
Maybe Dempsey gave Clegg
his ball.

00:38:26,023 --> 00:38:28,692
Why?
I don't--I don't know, man.

00:38:28,692 --> 00:38:30,194
Because they were
good friends, I guess.

00:38:30,194 --> 00:38:31,729
Wait, wait, go back.

00:38:31,729 --> 00:38:33,931
All right, so Clegg is
supposed to be getting rid

00:38:33,931 --> 00:38:36,233
of his friend's brain
for Pernin, right?

00:38:36,233 --> 00:38:38,803
But three hours
after the swap,

00:38:38,803 --> 00:38:40,771
he's still driving
around with it.

00:38:40,771 --> 00:38:42,373
Maybe he's driving around
with his friend's game ball

00:38:42,373 --> 00:38:45,242
for the same reason that he's
driving around with his brain.

00:38:45,242 --> 00:38:47,344
Maybe he's not trying
to help Pernin.

00:38:47,344 --> 00:38:49,847
Maybe he's trying
to help his old friend.

00:38:49,847 --> 00:38:51,248
You know what?
You know--

00:38:51,248 --> 00:38:52,983
There's a police
station about--

00:38:52,983 --> 00:38:55,052
about two blocks
from the Tasty Time.

00:38:55,052 --> 00:38:56,720
I'll bet you anything
that he was gonna

00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,223
bust Pernin for drugs,
and he died first.

00:38:59,223 --> 00:39:02,226
Right? Wait--whoa,
what are you doing?

00:39:02,226 --> 00:39:04,662
I think it's about time
to figure out how this football

00:39:04,662 --> 00:39:05,963
plays into all this,
don't you?

00:39:05,963 --> 00:39:08,032
Yeah, what the hell.
Go for it.

00:39:16,941 --> 00:39:18,075
Hold on.

00:39:25,382 --> 00:39:28,152
I guess you never really know
what's important.

00:39:41,232 --> 00:39:43,634
(beeping)

00:39:56,013 --> 00:39:57,748
Hey.

00:39:57,748 --> 00:40:00,417
Print on the syringe got us
a warrant to Pernin's house.

00:40:00,417 --> 00:40:04,755
Found this in his sock drawer.

00:40:04,755 --> 00:40:07,791
Let's see if his bullet matches
the one that killed Eller.

00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:14,165
Fire one.

00:40:14,165 --> 00:40:15,366
(gunshot)

00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:45,062
Nice.

00:40:56,874 --> 00:40:58,976
So we've got him dead to rights
on the Eller murder.

00:40:58,976 --> 00:41:00,744
But he won't flip
on Joyce Dempsey.

00:41:00,744 --> 00:41:03,681
Well, I guess he has
a large capacity for love.

00:41:03,681 --> 00:41:05,950
Joyce Dempsey's
one lucky woman.

00:41:07,818 --> 00:41:10,955
Want me to take
a pass with the kid?

00:41:10,955 --> 00:41:12,323
I got this one.

00:41:17,695 --> 00:41:19,697
Everybody, I'd like
a little privacy.

00:41:19,697 --> 00:41:21,265
Thank you very much.

00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,208
So remember when I told you
I took a swing at my dad

00:41:31,208 --> 00:41:34,278
and I never felt better
and never felt worse?

00:41:34,278 --> 00:41:37,181
Well, the better lasted,
like, 15 seconds.

00:41:37,181 --> 00:41:39,416
The worse...

00:41:39,416 --> 00:41:42,820
40 years, and counting.

00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:46,056
No one in this life
is all good or all bad.

00:41:46,056 --> 00:41:48,058
Even my dad had
a lot of good in him.

00:41:48,058 --> 00:41:49,727
And I know you had
a lot of good times

00:41:49,727 --> 00:41:51,095
with your dad too.

00:41:51,095 --> 00:41:55,799
Now you got to try
and help that dad.

00:41:55,799 --> 00:41:56,934
The one who loved you.

00:41:58,636 --> 00:42:02,172
Did your dad and mom
have a fight at the cabin

00:42:02,172 --> 00:42:03,374
about Mr. Pernin?

00:42:03,374 --> 00:42:04,942
They were always fighting.

00:42:04,942 --> 00:42:07,011
Yeah, but this time your mom
fought with a gun, right?

00:42:09,847 --> 00:42:12,816
Come on, Deck...

00:42:12,816 --> 00:42:14,051
remember the good.

00:42:14,051 --> 00:42:15,252
There were no good times.

00:42:16,987 --> 00:42:18,822
All I can remember
is being scared.

00:42:18,822 --> 00:42:20,758
Well, I'm sure your mom
was scared too.

00:42:20,758 --> 00:42:22,326
He threw me down the stairs.

00:42:22,326 --> 00:42:24,194
You didn't think
I'd find out?
(Joyce shouts)

00:42:24,194 --> 00:42:25,963
Everyone knows!

00:42:25,963 --> 00:42:30,934
He was choking my mom and
screaming and calling her names.

00:42:30,934 --> 00:42:33,003
But I couldn't stop him.

00:42:36,106 --> 00:42:38,776
And I know you think
my mom did it...

00:42:38,776 --> 00:42:41,378
Look, don't say another word.

00:42:41,378 --> 00:42:43,113
I killed him.

00:42:43,113 --> 00:42:44,815
JOYCE:
Declan, no!

00:42:47,117 --> 00:42:50,354
And, really,
I've never felt better.
