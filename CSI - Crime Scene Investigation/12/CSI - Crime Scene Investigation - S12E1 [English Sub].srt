00:00:29,082 --> 00:00:30,984
(grunting)

00:00:30,984 --> 00:00:31,918
Yeah, baby!

00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,735
Hey, it's Carrot Top.

00:00:48,735 --> 00:00:50,470
Welcome aboard
the inner casino tram system.

00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:52,639
This takes you from the
Palermo Hotel all the way down

00:00:52,639 --> 00:00:54,140
to the Mediterranean Hotel.

00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:56,009
This is the best way to get
from hotel to hotel.

00:00:56,009 --> 00:00:57,677
Just take the tram.
It's easy, it's smart, too.

00:00:57,677 --> 00:00:59,746
It's like 150 degrees outside
in the shade.

00:00:59,746 --> 00:01:02,015
It's like 4:00 a.m., and you're
like... " I think my heart's..."

00:01:25,105 --> 00:01:27,874
(woman screaming)

00:01:38,184 --> 00:01:42,022
CARROT TOP:
Don't spend all your kids'
college funds at one hotel.

00:01:42,022 --> 00:01:44,791
Spread the wealth, you know.
Put a little bit everywhere.

00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:46,159
Drinking, gambling, smoking,
prostitution.

00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,094
Bring the kids. It's great.

00:01:48,094 --> 00:01:50,096
And when you're in Vegas,
go see a movie,

00:01:50,096 --> 00:01:51,965
maybe go shopping.
go check out a show,

00:01:51,965 --> 00:01:53,967
but save room for carrot cake!

00:01:53,967 --> 00:01:55,435
(growls)

00:01:55,435 --> 00:01:57,070
Looks like we're
at our destination.

00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:59,139
Remember, go explore the wonders
of the Mediterranean.

00:01:59,139 --> 00:02:02,075
Remember, in Vegas,
anything can happen.

00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:06,846
Hey, next time we break in
a new supervisor,

00:02:06,846 --> 00:02:08,915
I'm in Hawaii,
toes in the sand,

00:02:08,915 --> 00:02:10,016
drink in my hand.

00:02:10,016 --> 00:02:10,984
And I won't be looking at bugs.

00:02:12,552 --> 00:02:14,087
Have fun in there.

00:02:14,087 --> 00:02:17,457
Aloha, stranger.
Aloha.

00:02:17,457 --> 00:02:19,926
Did you have
a good training session?
Yeah, you know, three weeks

00:02:19,926 --> 00:02:21,928
of sand, surf and scarabs.

00:02:21,928 --> 00:02:23,830
Well, I hope you got some rest,

00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:25,732
'cause it's looking like
a serious Tower-Caper.

00:02:25,732 --> 00:02:28,001
Oh, yeah? Whose tower,
the sheriff or the mayor's?

00:02:28,001 --> 00:02:29,102
Both.

00:02:29,102 --> 00:02:30,670
Mm, I'm excited.

00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,205
Well, good.

00:02:32,205 --> 00:02:34,007
Shootout at the LV corral.

00:02:34,007 --> 00:02:35,775
Two dead, three injured.

00:02:40,747 --> 00:02:42,482
Whoa, I thought
you said two dead.

00:02:44,017 --> 00:02:45,552
I did.

00:02:45,552 --> 00:02:48,054
Well, wh-what's,
what's going on?

00:02:48,054 --> 00:02:50,957
Should I be worried
about something here?

00:02:50,957 --> 00:02:52,492
Welcome back.

00:02:54,527 --> 00:02:56,796
You must be Stokes.

00:02:56,796 --> 00:02:58,732
Yeah.

00:02:58,732 --> 00:03:00,033
Yeah, you, uh...

00:03:00,033 --> 00:03:02,168
you must be contaminating
the crime scene.

00:03:02,168 --> 00:03:06,172
No, no, no.
I already cleared the area.

00:03:06,172 --> 00:03:08,141
Give me a hand, will ya?
Yeah.

00:03:08,141 --> 00:03:12,011
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

00:03:12,011 --> 00:03:14,681
Oh, uh, D.B. Russell.
New guy.

00:03:14,681 --> 00:03:17,450
D.B.-- really?

00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:19,519
(chuckling):
Right. Crazy.

00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,888
Platform surveillance.

00:03:22,956 --> 00:03:24,157
Party at the Palermo.

00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:27,160
Hangover at the Mediterranean.

00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,695
Time stamp.

00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:34,434
Wow, the whole ride
only lasted 73 seconds.

00:03:34,434 --> 00:03:37,070
That's about as long as
it took you to size me up.

00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:38,471
Which is not bad,

00:03:38,471 --> 00:03:40,940
'cause he's still working on it.

00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:43,576

Hmm. What are you doing here,
little buddy?

EMTs said the wounded mom's face
was covered in ants.

00:04:28,221 --> 00:04:31,791
Spilled Mai Tai
right where she went down.

00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:34,160
Explains the ant face,
but how'd they get here?

00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,629
These are red harvesters.

00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:39,599
<i>Pogonomyrmex barbatus.</i>

00:04:39,599 --> 00:04:41,835
They're really the showgirls
of the ant kingdom.

00:04:41,835 --> 00:04:43,603
They're perfect
for things like...

00:04:43,603 --> 00:04:45,638
Ant farms.
Yeah.

00:04:45,638 --> 00:04:47,907
That would explain the sand.

00:04:47,907 --> 00:04:50,009
The kid must have had it
and dropped it.

00:04:51,544 --> 00:04:54,781
Six years old--
seeing all of this.

00:04:54,781 --> 00:04:57,951
What's the, uh, what's
the cowboy telling us, Suit?

00:04:57,951 --> 00:05:00,153
A single gunshot wound
to the chest.

00:05:00,153 --> 00:05:02,555
Not a lot of blood.

00:05:02,555 --> 00:05:04,057
Game over in seconds.

00:05:04,057 --> 00:05:06,593
His right hand tested
positive for GSR.

00:05:06,593 --> 00:05:09,128
The security guard
had a .357.

00:05:09,128 --> 00:05:11,531
So the Beretta belongs
to the cowboy.

00:05:11,531 --> 00:05:14,167
And let me take a look
at this.

00:05:14,167 --> 00:05:17,003
(magazine clicking)

00:05:18,071 --> 00:05:20,540
Two shots fired.

00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:23,643
How did Baseball Jersey do?

00:05:23,643 --> 00:05:25,812
Well, there's a lot of blood,

00:05:25,812 --> 00:05:28,848
but it looks like a single
shot near the liver.

00:05:28,848 --> 00:05:30,183
It's a really awkward angle.

00:05:30,183 --> 00:05:33,152
A crossfire hit, maybe.
Bled out.

00:05:38,725 --> 00:05:40,560
Thank you, <i>Suit.</i>

00:05:42,095 --> 00:05:43,763
Thomas Finnerty.

00:05:43,763 --> 00:05:46,699
Locust Valley, New York.

00:05:46,699 --> 00:05:49,168
No cash.
Credit cards still here.

00:05:49,168 --> 00:05:51,170
What is all this stuff?

00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:53,473
It's slimy.

00:05:53,473 --> 00:05:55,174
It's like the tram puked.

00:05:59,078 --> 00:06:00,513
Ah.

00:06:00,513 --> 00:06:03,516
The rust pattern
on the thing up here

00:06:03,516 --> 00:06:06,486
looks exactly the Centaurus
constellation.

00:06:06,486 --> 00:06:09,689
(chuckling):
How cool is that. Huh.

00:06:09,689 --> 00:06:12,091
And that looks like a ricochet.

00:06:12,091 --> 00:06:14,494
Maybe.

00:06:14,494 --> 00:06:15,795
(cell phone chiming)

00:06:15,795 --> 00:06:17,030
Russell.

00:06:18,431 --> 00:06:20,667
Okay, where?

00:06:20,667 --> 00:06:23,069
I just finished up
my shift at the Palermo.

00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:25,538
Minding my own business.
I hear a shot.

00:06:25,538 --> 00:06:28,041
I look up. The guy
in the cowboy hat's got a gun.

00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:30,043
So, I took
a deep breath,

00:06:30,043 --> 00:06:31,844
went by the book.

00:06:31,844 --> 00:06:34,213
How many rounds did you fire?
Two or three.

00:06:34,213 --> 00:06:37,050
They tell me you didn't know
this guy, right?
No, I didn't know him.

00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:38,952
What I know is, he pulled
a nine mil in a crowd.

00:06:38,952 --> 00:06:40,186
Yeah, I didn't hear anything.
I was in the car

00:06:40,186 --> 00:06:42,455
in front;
it was quiet.

00:06:42,455 --> 00:06:45,792
Did you see anyone or anything
odd on the Palermo platform?

00:06:45,792 --> 00:06:48,995
No. I'd lost my rent in keno,

00:06:48,995 --> 00:06:50,596
so I was a bit dazed.

00:06:50,596 --> 00:06:52,966
I heard people died.

00:06:52,966 --> 00:06:54,834
The sheriff will be
making a statement soon.

00:06:54,834 --> 00:06:56,202
Thank you for your time.

00:06:59,672 --> 00:07:01,674
His first mistake
was playing keno.

00:07:01,674 --> 00:07:03,009
It's the worst odds in town.

00:07:03,009 --> 00:07:04,744
Good to know.

00:07:04,744 --> 00:07:06,779
All right, we've accounted
for all the passengers

00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:08,715
in the kill car
except for two.

00:07:08,715 --> 00:07:09,849
They're in the wind.

00:07:09,849 --> 00:07:11,718
WILLOWS:
Any word on the mom?

00:07:11,718 --> 00:07:13,553
Yeah, she's out of surgery.
She's going to be fine.

00:07:13,553 --> 00:07:17,023
I just got a call.
A 419 in...Brim County?

00:07:17,023 --> 00:07:18,558
Brime.
Brime.

00:07:18,558 --> 00:07:22,428
Brime. So, probably
a two-person job.

00:07:22,428 --> 00:07:24,097
What do you think?

00:07:24,097 --> 00:07:25,999
What do I think?
You're the boss.

00:07:25,999 --> 00:07:28,601
I think you should stop
asking me what I think.

00:07:28,601 --> 00:07:30,603
I'm glad we got that
out of the way.

00:07:30,603 --> 00:07:33,639
I'll take it. I haven't been
to Brim County in a while.

00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:35,675
I just heard
"Brime." Wh...?

00:07:36,876 --> 00:07:37,944
(chuckles)

00:07:37,944 --> 00:07:39,579
Take Saunders with you.

00:07:39,579 --> 00:07:40,713
Sanders.
Sanders.

00:07:40,713 --> 00:07:42,715
I'll get it.

00:07:46,753 --> 00:07:49,422
♪ ♪

00:08:09,108 --> 00:08:11,044
You were right.

00:08:11,044 --> 00:08:12,645
Ricochet?

00:08:12,645 --> 00:08:14,547
Yeah.

00:08:14,547 --> 00:08:16,883
SANDERS:
<i>All right. Thanks a lot.</i>

00:08:20,486 --> 00:08:21,988
Camper found him.

00:08:21,988 --> 00:08:23,790
No I.D.

00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:25,892
Did you see the look
on Nick's face

00:08:25,892 --> 00:08:28,561
on the tram when he saw Russell
just lying there?

00:08:28,561 --> 00:08:30,430
Awesome.

00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:33,499
Yesterday, Russell put on
a murder victim's watch,

00:08:33,499 --> 00:08:35,168
but he kept asking me
for the time.

00:08:35,168 --> 00:08:36,769
And so finally I was like,

00:08:36,769 --> 00:08:38,171
"Russell, what time is it?"

00:08:38,171 --> 00:08:40,673
And he just looked at his watch
and walked away.

00:08:40,673 --> 00:08:42,108
He did catch
that Gig Harbor Killer.

00:08:42,108 --> 00:08:44,043
Maybe it works for him.

00:08:44,043 --> 00:08:46,946
Do you want to lie down
on the ground and play
dead or should I?

00:08:46,946 --> 00:08:50,049
(laughing): No sign
of animal activity.

00:08:50,049 --> 00:08:52,185
SANDERS:
Now, the coroner said that
he had puncture wound

00:08:52,185 --> 00:08:53,453
in his belly.

00:08:53,453 --> 00:08:54,687
So where's the blood?

00:08:55,721 --> 00:08:56,823
(camera shutter clicks)

00:08:56,823 --> 00:09:00,193
Ew, never seen
that before.

00:09:00,193 --> 00:09:03,663
Face of a Jonas Brother,
body of my Grandpa Pete.

00:09:03,663 --> 00:09:04,964
Shirt's stretched out.

00:09:04,964 --> 00:09:06,499
incremental tears.

00:09:06,499 --> 00:09:08,768
SANDERS:
Most of the buttons missing.

00:09:08,768 --> 00:09:10,636
Ripped off during the scuffle?

00:09:13,206 --> 00:09:16,008
SANDERS: Now we just need
to find our primary.

00:09:16,008 --> 00:09:18,878
Hey, the casino's all over
my ass about this tram.

00:09:18,878 --> 00:09:20,847
They want their
tram back pronto.

00:09:20,847 --> 00:09:22,849
No people mover,
no money in their pockets.

00:09:22,849 --> 00:09:24,617
So I told them
it was your call.

00:09:24,617 --> 00:09:27,120
So what's it going
to be, D.B.?

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,023
Okay, let's wrap it up.

00:09:31,023 --> 00:09:32,658
But we haven't even
collected all the blood yet.

00:09:32,658 --> 00:09:35,962
Yeah, exactly.
Let's wrap it up to go.

00:09:35,962 --> 00:09:38,731
What, you want to take
the whole tram back

00:09:38,731 --> 00:09:40,967
to the CSI lab?
The whole thing?

00:09:40,967 --> 00:09:42,935
Why? Where
would you take it?

00:09:42,935 --> 00:09:45,104
Excuse me
just a second.

00:09:45,104 --> 00:09:47,507
(belches)
Oh, too many bubbles.

00:09:50,143 --> 00:09:52,145
BRASS:
<i>Yeah, I'm at the hospital now.</i>

00:09:52,145 --> 00:09:55,148
I got to run.
Hey, Albert, thanks
for coming in, man.

00:09:55,148 --> 00:09:57,216
You know, the ER doc
looks like...

00:09:57,216 --> 00:09:58,217
Hey.

00:09:58,217 --> 00:09:59,919
Hey.

00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:02,021
I've got some questions
about the mom's wounds.

00:10:02,021 --> 00:10:03,689
Well, it's a pleasure
to be here.

00:10:03,689 --> 00:10:05,525
Somebody alive
is a nice change.

00:10:05,525 --> 00:10:07,026
Yeah.

00:10:07,026 --> 00:10:08,895
Hey, hear anything
about Ray Langston?

00:10:08,895 --> 00:10:12,098
Yeah. Gloria's doing well,
so he's doing well.

00:10:12,098 --> 00:10:13,733
Baltimore's proven to be

00:10:13,733 --> 00:10:16,602
a potent medicinal
for both of them.
Medicinal?

00:10:16,602 --> 00:10:21,607
You call being railroaded
by IA therapeutic?

00:10:21,607 --> 00:10:23,476
A serial killer
is dead.

00:10:23,476 --> 00:10:25,178
The world's a better
place, right?

00:10:25,178 --> 00:10:27,680
Jim, Ray's back
with the woman he loves.

00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,916
He's got a second chance.

00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:33,085
I think killing Haskell
may have saved his life.

00:10:37,089 --> 00:10:39,025
Before she blacked out,

00:10:39,025 --> 00:10:41,194
she told the paramedics
she felt paralysis in her legs.

00:10:41,194 --> 00:10:43,629
The gunshot didn't do that.

00:10:43,629 --> 00:10:44,897
Well, something
on that tram did.

00:10:44,897 --> 00:10:47,867
Well, this is strange.
What?

00:10:53,573 --> 00:10:54,941
A puncture of some kind.

00:10:54,941 --> 00:10:58,211
Needle mark? Bug bite?

00:10:58,211 --> 00:11:00,446
That's a hell of a big bug.

00:11:00,446 --> 00:11:01,847
Here you go.

00:11:01,847 --> 00:11:03,182
I think this is yours,
isn't it, pal?

00:11:03,182 --> 00:11:04,517
Hmm?

00:11:06,752 --> 00:11:08,955
<i>Secret Seal,</i> right?

00:11:08,955 --> 00:11:13,025
Boy, I loves me
some <i>Secret Seal.</i>

00:11:13,025 --> 00:11:14,694
Hmm.

00:11:14,694 --> 00:11:17,063
Say, who's your favorite
character on there?

00:11:18,864 --> 00:11:19,999
Okay, I'll tell you what.

00:11:19,999 --> 00:11:21,534
I'm gonna leave it right here

00:11:21,534 --> 00:11:23,536
till you're ready for it.

00:11:30,176 --> 00:11:32,645
Yeah, you're doing great, bud.

00:11:35,615 --> 00:11:37,717
Hey, Nick.

00:11:37,717 --> 00:11:40,653
Have you seen my tennis ball
anywhere?

00:11:41,721 --> 00:11:43,022
Hmm?

00:11:43,022 --> 00:11:44,890
You know, the invisible one?

00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:48,894
Um...
No, I, uh,

00:11:48,894 --> 00:11:50,529
I haven't seen it.

00:11:50,529 --> 00:11:52,932
Oh, for goodness' sakes,
it's right here.

00:11:54,634 --> 00:11:57,003
God, I love these things.

00:12:00,006 --> 00:12:01,641
Still got it.

00:12:01,641 --> 00:12:03,609
Oop.

00:12:03,609 --> 00:12:05,811
Hey.

00:12:05,811 --> 00:12:07,913
See if you can
get one by me.
Yeah.

00:12:07,913 --> 00:12:11,050
Oh, you're gonna play
that way, are you?

00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:13,019
Whoop, Emmett, heads up.

00:12:15,721 --> 00:12:16,722
Where'd you get it?

00:12:16,722 --> 00:12:17,957
Uh...

00:12:17,957 --> 00:12:21,093
That was, uh...
Target, yeah. On sale.

00:12:21,093 --> 00:12:22,628
You can keep it
if you want.

00:12:22,628 --> 00:12:23,796
Thanks.

00:12:23,796 --> 00:12:25,131
(chuckling):
You're welcome.

00:12:28,067 --> 00:12:31,203
Listen, I-I know it's hard,

00:12:31,203 --> 00:12:32,938
but Emmett...

00:12:32,938 --> 00:12:35,675
if you can tell us anything
you saw on the tram,

00:12:35,675 --> 00:12:37,443
it would be very helpful.

00:12:37,443 --> 00:12:38,911
It's okay if you can't
remember anything.

00:12:38,911 --> 00:12:40,780
(sighs)

00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,548
I saw an alien.

00:12:42,548 --> 00:12:44,450
Wow.

00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:46,986
Big one, or...
a little one?

00:12:46,986 --> 00:12:49,922
Little one.

00:12:49,922 --> 00:12:52,091
Was it by itself?

00:12:58,197 --> 00:13:00,666
Okay.

00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:03,202
ROBBINS:
<i>Got an ID on our cowboy.</i>

00:13:03,202 --> 00:13:06,605
Robert Mundler.
Tolleson, Arizona.

00:13:06,605 --> 00:13:08,040
In town for the gun show.

00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,109
And he decides
to start his own.

00:13:10,109 --> 00:13:13,979
I recovered a bullet
from his chest.

00:13:13,979 --> 00:13:15,648
It severed
the ascending aorta.

00:13:15,648 --> 00:13:17,817
Sent it off to Ballistics,
came back a .357.

00:13:17,817 --> 00:13:19,118
Well, it's the same caliber

00:13:19,118 --> 00:13:20,953
as the two we collected
from the mom.

00:13:20,953 --> 00:13:24,957
Confirms that our security guard
got off at least three shots.

00:13:24,957 --> 00:13:28,127
So, who ruined
Mr. Finnerty's night?

00:13:28,127 --> 00:13:29,795
The cowboy or
security guard?

00:13:29,795 --> 00:13:30,863
Neither.

00:13:30,863 --> 00:13:33,099
He had other complications.

00:13:33,099 --> 00:13:36,001
He was suffering from
advanced mesothelioma.

00:13:36,001 --> 00:13:39,071
The lungs are encased by
a dense, fibrotic mass.

00:13:40,439 --> 00:13:42,074
Tumors infiltrated the ribs

00:13:42,074 --> 00:13:43,776
and intercostal muscles.

00:13:43,776 --> 00:13:45,044
How much time did he have?

00:13:45,044 --> 00:13:47,113
Three months at best.
Mercifully

00:13:47,113 --> 00:13:49,081
cut short by sharp-force trauma,

00:13:49,081 --> 00:13:50,049
transecting his liver.

00:13:51,817 --> 00:13:53,919
Wait a minute.
He wasn't shot?

00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:56,655
Nope. Another crime,
another assailant.

00:13:56,655 --> 00:14:00,159
Somebody brought a knife
to a gun fight.

00:14:04,897 --> 00:14:08,868
RUSSELL:
Okay. So in 73 seconds,
we have a gunfight

00:14:08,868 --> 00:14:10,836
and a guy getting stabbed.

00:14:10,836 --> 00:14:12,705
STOKES:
Yeah, and don't forget
about Mom's bug bite.

00:14:12,705 --> 00:14:14,740
What the hell didn't
happen on this ride?

00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,675
Okay, all right. Let's
start with what we know.

00:14:16,675 --> 00:14:18,110
Go ahead.

00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:19,979
Red strings are the
security guard's.

00:14:19,979 --> 00:14:21,547
He saw the cowboy
draw his gun.

00:14:21,547 --> 00:14:23,649
Got off three shots.

00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:25,785
STOKES:
<i>Two shots missed</i>
<i>and hit the mom;</i>

00:14:25,785 --> 00:14:27,153
<i>the third kills the cowboy.</i>

00:14:27,153 --> 00:14:30,022
How'd our cowboy do
at the rodeo?

00:14:30,022 --> 00:14:31,891
STOKES:
Well, the green
strings are his.

00:14:31,891 --> 00:14:35,428
He returns fire. One shot was a
total miss, hitting the window.

00:14:35,428 --> 00:14:38,798
And then the other one went
through the security guard,

00:14:38,798 --> 00:14:40,566
and kind of just
takes a tour of the tram.

00:14:40,566 --> 00:14:42,101
And the bullet goes...

00:14:42,101 --> 00:14:44,136
up and ricochets.

00:14:44,136 --> 00:14:46,038
(cell phone chimes)

00:14:46,038 --> 00:14:47,573
Oh. Sorry.

00:14:47,573 --> 00:14:49,041
Hold that thought.

00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:50,042
Could be my wife.

00:14:50,042 --> 00:14:51,677
(chuckles)

00:14:51,677 --> 00:14:53,946
Hey, honey.

00:14:53,946 --> 00:14:55,581
Uh... well, I'll ask.

00:14:55,581 --> 00:14:57,049
Um...

00:14:57,049 --> 00:14:59,218
My wife's calling about
a farmers market.

00:14:59,218 --> 00:15:01,487
You, you guys have
those here, right?

00:15:04,723 --> 00:15:08,060
Um, you know what? I'm going
to have to call you back.

00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:10,095
All right.
Explain this to me:

00:15:10,095 --> 00:15:12,131
If the stabbing victim,
Tom Finnerty,

00:15:12,131 --> 00:15:13,666
is standing right here,

00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:15,768
in the middle
of the crossfire,

00:15:15,768 --> 00:15:17,770
how come he's not Swiss cheese?

00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:19,939
Well, he must have gone down
before the shooting started.

00:15:19,939 --> 00:15:22,074
I'll buy that.

00:15:22,074 --> 00:15:24,076
Yeah, and don't forget
about the slime.

00:15:24,076 --> 00:15:25,644
Yeah, all right.
So the...

00:15:25,644 --> 00:15:28,881
the slime path goes
over the Mai Tai,

00:15:28,881 --> 00:15:32,718
which means the slime event
came later in the ride.

00:15:32,718 --> 00:15:34,720
Did someone
say "slime"?

00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,489
Actually, uh,

00:15:36,489 --> 00:15:38,457
what you're looking at
is a concentrated mixture

00:15:38,457 --> 00:15:40,192
of mucus, tyrosinase,

00:15:40,192 --> 00:15:42,928
lysine and sodium chloride.
Meaning...

00:15:42,928 --> 00:15:46,532
Meaning... there was
an octopus on board.

00:15:46,532 --> 00:15:49,468
A cephalopod mollusk,
technically.

00:15:49,468 --> 00:15:50,536
Uh, how'd you know?

00:15:50,536 --> 00:15:53,172
The kid said he saw an alien.

00:15:53,172 --> 00:15:56,475
And we found saltwater
trace in the slime.

00:15:56,475 --> 00:15:59,678
Not sure how the alien part
factors into the equation.

00:15:59,678 --> 00:16:01,647
All right. Look.

00:16:01,647 --> 00:16:04,984
Slime path heads
towards the door, right?

00:16:04,984 --> 00:16:08,220
What if our ricochet
left the scene?

00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,221
(gunshot)

00:16:09,221 --> 00:16:10,589
(sloshing)

00:16:10,589 --> 00:16:15,127
I think that our
'pod got winged.

00:16:15,127 --> 00:16:17,429
Well, it's all perfectly
logical, except for one thing.

00:16:18,931 --> 00:16:21,634
What's an octopus doing
on a Vegas tram?

00:16:24,069 --> 00:16:26,572
SIDLE:
What do you make of
the Shar-Pei chest?

00:16:26,572 --> 00:16:27,973
Exposure?

00:16:27,973 --> 00:16:29,775
It's more like
the skin was stretched.

00:16:36,148 --> 00:16:37,683
That's odd.

00:16:38,784 --> 00:16:40,452
Connective tissues separated

00:16:40,452 --> 00:16:42,054
from the subcutaneous fat.

00:16:42,054 --> 00:16:43,756
Falls right off the muscle.

00:16:45,424 --> 00:16:48,494
Dark residue along the
stratum germinativum

00:16:48,494 --> 00:16:50,663
It's curious.

00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:52,731
Ugh.

00:16:52,731 --> 00:16:54,800
Just got results back from

00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,135
Shar-Pei's shirt and pants.

00:16:56,135 --> 00:16:57,836
Found traces of "Bambi blood."

00:16:57,836 --> 00:16:59,138
Huh.

00:16:59,138 --> 00:17:01,473
You know, he had
GSR on his hand.

00:17:01,473 --> 00:17:02,575
Maybe he was a hunter.

00:17:04,877 --> 00:17:06,979
SANDERS:
That doesn't look like a knife.

00:17:06,979 --> 00:17:08,447
Barely penetrated the skin.

00:17:10,516 --> 00:17:11,517
Wait a sec.

00:17:11,517 --> 00:17:12,685
This...

00:17:12,685 --> 00:17:15,154
is so incredible.

00:17:15,154 --> 00:17:16,555
I think I know what happened.

00:17:17,623 --> 00:17:18,791
I gotta make a call.

00:17:24,029 --> 00:17:26,699
Thanks for the heads-up,
Catherine.

00:17:27,967 --> 00:17:29,735
Nicky, I'm sorry.

00:17:29,735 --> 00:17:31,904
There's just been a hell of
a lot going on around here.

00:17:31,904 --> 00:17:34,640
New boss needed an office;
I gave him yours, I'm sorry.

00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,542
You know he's growing
'shrooms in there, right?

00:17:36,542 --> 00:17:38,677
They're supposed
to be medicinal.
Medicinal?

00:17:38,677 --> 00:17:40,212
Don't get me started.
This is great.

00:17:40,212 --> 00:17:42,548
Ray Langston screws up,
and we all gotta pay for it.

00:17:42,548 --> 00:17:43,782
Awesome. This is
really fair.

00:17:43,782 --> 00:17:45,050
Hey, guys.

00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:46,218
Morgan.

00:17:46,218 --> 00:17:48,921
Good to see you.
(phone ringing)

00:17:48,921 --> 00:17:50,122
Um, that's my phone.
Excuse me.

00:17:52,191 --> 00:17:54,460
I'm sorry, Morgan.
Good to see you.

00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,694
How's it going?

00:17:55,694 --> 00:17:57,630
You know... it's going.

00:17:59,031 --> 00:18:01,000
You're not leaving?

00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,470
No, no. I'm just, uh,
moving offices, I guess.

00:18:06,705 --> 00:18:07,906
I heard about Langston.

00:18:07,906 --> 00:18:10,042
Yeah. Yeah.

00:18:10,042 --> 00:18:11,610
So what are you doing here?

00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:14,480
I'm due for
a little Vegas action.

00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,715
STOKES:
Oh, well...
all the action's at

00:18:16,715 --> 00:18:18,517
the Strip, it's not
around here. Hey, Greg.

00:18:18,517 --> 00:18:20,552
Come here, I want you
to meet somebody.

00:18:20,552 --> 00:18:21,553
Morgan Brody,

00:18:21,553 --> 00:18:22,988
this is Greg Sanders.

00:18:22,988 --> 00:18:24,957
Greg was our L.A. expert
on the Haskell case.

00:18:24,957 --> 00:18:27,059
Oh, right!
Great work.

00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:28,761
Good to put a face
with the name.

00:18:28,761 --> 00:18:31,063
You don't look
like a history nerd.

00:18:31,063 --> 00:18:32,197
Neither do you.

00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:35,134
I mean the nerd part.

00:18:35,134 --> 00:18:36,802
Not that you are a nerd.

00:18:36,802 --> 00:18:38,737
Or that there's anything
wrong with being a nerd.

00:18:40,439 --> 00:18:41,573
Right.

00:18:43,108 --> 00:18:44,443
I'll catch you guys later.

00:18:44,443 --> 00:18:45,210
Yeah.

00:18:49,748 --> 00:18:52,117
That's Ecklie's daughter?

00:18:52,117 --> 00:18:54,720
Don't even think about
it, I'm telling you.

00:18:58,991 --> 00:19:02,161
I finally found him under the
tracks at the Palermo station.

00:19:02,161 --> 00:19:04,563
PHILLIPS:
Hmm, good shape,
considering.

00:19:04,563 --> 00:19:06,565
I do love a good "octopsy."

00:19:06,565 --> 00:19:07,833
Hodges, please.

00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:09,001
Sorry.

00:19:13,439 --> 00:19:14,773
(sighs)

00:19:14,773 --> 00:19:17,743
COD is... hearts failure.

00:19:17,743 --> 00:19:19,611
They have three.

00:19:19,611 --> 00:19:21,480
Looks like the bullet

00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,582
perforated the bronchial hearts

00:19:23,582 --> 00:19:26,785
and lodged right in the

00:19:26,785 --> 00:19:28,454
oxygenating heart.

00:19:34,493 --> 00:19:36,462
...four, five, six.

00:19:36,462 --> 00:19:38,630
Right twist. Nine mil.

00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:40,999
Consistent with
the cowboy's Beretta.

00:19:40,999 --> 00:19:42,067
(bullet clinks)

00:19:42,067 --> 00:19:43,535
Oh, my.

00:19:43,535 --> 00:19:45,971
Looks like human
tissue on the beak.

00:19:45,971 --> 00:19:47,606
I think he bit somebody.

00:19:47,606 --> 00:19:49,208
Somebody's mother.

00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:51,110
That would explain
Mrs. Drake's paralysis.

00:19:52,911 --> 00:19:54,980
Huh.

00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,181
Got something you like?

00:19:56,181 --> 00:19:58,951
I do. Look at our
missing couple.

00:19:58,951 --> 00:20:01,687
I think I can explain
why Señor Ocho

00:20:01,687 --> 00:20:03,021
was on that tram.

00:20:03,021 --> 00:20:05,858
Look at the tattoo:
vintage diving helmet.

00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,562
Japanese woman.
Octopus.

00:20:10,562 --> 00:20:13,532
Two words:
<i>shokushu goukan.</i>

00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,135
Tentacle erotica.

00:20:16,135 --> 00:20:17,669
Ancient Japanese secret.

00:20:17,669 --> 00:20:20,038
Men will pay money
to watch women...

00:20:20,038 --> 00:20:21,907
Make love with
Señor Ocho?

00:20:21,907 --> 00:20:23,976
Ew.
Oh, come on.

00:20:23,976 --> 00:20:25,611
Eight times the pleasure,
eight times the fun.

00:20:25,611 --> 00:20:27,913
I don't get it.
So... Red Dress had

00:20:27,913 --> 00:20:28,981
Octopus on a leash?

00:20:28,981 --> 00:20:32,117
No. No, as a matter of fact...

00:20:32,117 --> 00:20:33,886
in her purse.

00:20:33,886 --> 00:20:36,955
Purse looks full going in,

00:20:36,955 --> 00:20:37,923
empty coming out.

00:20:39,591 --> 00:20:43,629
Let me, uh... let me
ask you something real quick.

00:20:43,629 --> 00:20:45,898
I'm kind of new in town.

00:20:45,898 --> 00:20:47,766
Do you know any good

00:20:47,766 --> 00:20:49,701
<i>shokushu goukan</i> parlors?

00:20:52,905 --> 00:20:54,840
♪ ♪

00:21:17,629 --> 00:21:19,164
SeaWorld's closed.

00:21:22,634 --> 00:21:25,137
So you want to tell me about
your little tram ride adventure

00:21:25,137 --> 00:21:28,040
last night?
I wasn't on a tram.
I was in a tub.

00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,943
So, that's not you
fleeing a crime scene?

00:21:30,943 --> 00:21:33,111
I didn't feel like getting shot.

00:21:33,111 --> 00:21:34,980
BRASS: No, who does?
I don't feel like getting shot.

00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,014
You know, I've
always wondered.

00:21:36,014 --> 00:21:38,917
What do you feed those guys?

00:21:38,917 --> 00:21:41,887
Crayfish, mostly.
Ah.

00:21:41,887 --> 00:21:45,023
Claude actually had a thing
for shrimp.

00:21:45,023 --> 00:21:46,992
He was fussy.

00:21:46,992 --> 00:21:48,994
But he was worth it.

00:21:48,994 --> 00:21:51,063
So Claude was on the tram?

00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:53,866
I'm sorry for your loss.

00:21:53,866 --> 00:21:56,068
So you found Claude?

00:21:56,068 --> 00:21:57,903
Forget about Claude. Okay?

00:21:57,903 --> 00:21:59,872
Let's talk about the guy
with the knife in his gut.

00:21:59,872 --> 00:22:01,707
Look, I had nothing to do
with that.

00:22:01,707 --> 00:22:03,041
Oh, well,
maybe your boyfriend did.

00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:05,911
Boyfriend? You mean the psycho
with the blade?

00:22:05,911 --> 00:22:08,881
Look, one second he's drooling
all over me,

00:22:08,881 --> 00:22:11,116
shoving a room key in my...

00:22:11,116 --> 00:22:14,086
Next second,
he's got a knife out.

00:22:14,086 --> 00:22:17,189
...like magic. I'll
show you a magic room...

00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:19,858
Hey.

00:22:19,858 --> 00:22:21,560
(groans)

00:22:23,795 --> 00:22:25,931
The poor guy
in the baseball jersey.

00:22:25,931 --> 00:22:28,166
Do you still
have that hotel key?

00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:30,636
That depends on what you're
gonna charge me with.

00:22:30,636 --> 00:22:32,437
We're gonna charge
you with... (stammers)

00:22:32,437 --> 00:22:34,439
Wh-What?

00:22:34,439 --> 00:22:36,141
(sighs)

00:22:36,141 --> 00:22:38,043
Do you want to see Claude again?

00:22:38,043 --> 00:22:40,178
Yes.

00:22:40,178 --> 00:22:41,880
I can make that happen,

00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,849
but we'll need
to see that hotel key.

00:22:43,849 --> 00:22:45,784
Okay?
Okay.

00:22:51,056 --> 00:22:52,991
The room's registered
to Tom Finnerty.
The victim?

00:22:52,991 --> 00:22:53,959
Yeah.

00:22:55,994 --> 00:22:58,764
Las Vegas Police.
Open up.

00:23:09,942 --> 00:23:11,910
Got the knife.

00:23:24,589 --> 00:23:26,124
Suicide.

00:23:29,161 --> 00:23:31,029
(snorts, snores)

00:23:32,965 --> 00:23:34,599
Whoa...
(gasps)

00:23:35,667 --> 00:23:37,602
Am I dead?

00:23:39,705 --> 00:23:43,208
I swear to God,
I didn't kill my brother.

00:23:47,846 --> 00:23:49,581
Tom was my brother.
I'd never hurt my b...

00:23:49,581 --> 00:23:51,616
Why would I hurt my brother?

00:23:51,616 --> 00:23:53,819
You do know that we
found the murder weapon
in your hotel room, right?

00:23:53,819 --> 00:23:55,954
With your fingerprints
all over it?

00:23:55,954 --> 00:23:58,590
Look, man, my brother
only had a few months left.

00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:00,659
He was dying of
lung cancer, so...

00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:02,627
I was giving him
a make-a-wish weekend.

00:24:02,627 --> 00:24:04,930
It says here, Jimmy,
that you served two years

00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:08,667
in juvie for auto theft,
and two in Ely for assault,

00:24:08,667 --> 00:24:10,669
and that you're currently
out on parole

00:24:10,669 --> 00:24:12,537
from Corcoran
for another assault.

00:24:12,537 --> 00:24:13,872
And do you know that it's

00:24:13,872 --> 00:24:16,575
a violation of your parole
to be in Vegas?

00:24:16,575 --> 00:24:18,810
JIMMY: All that's true, except
the part about killing Tom.

00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:21,947
I don't even know
how it happened.

00:24:21,947 --> 00:24:24,182
We were heading to the tram.

00:24:24,182 --> 00:24:28,120
And I see this
hot Asian chick

00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,489
in a tight red dress...

00:24:30,489 --> 00:24:34,960
<i>Tom catches up to me and, uh,</i>
<i>he's got this friggin' knife</i>

00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,896
<i>sticking out of him,</i>
<i>and so I pulled it out.</i>

00:24:37,896 --> 00:24:40,766
<i>Then the guy in the cowboy hat</i>
<i>started shooting.</i>

00:24:40,766 --> 00:24:44,202
Tommy was dying. Um...

00:24:44,202 --> 00:24:45,904
Nothing I could do.

00:24:48,006 --> 00:24:51,076
Well, if I really loved
my brother,

00:24:51,076 --> 00:24:52,911
I would have stayed with him.
I wouldn't have just

00:24:52,911 --> 00:24:55,147
left him alone to die like that.

00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:01,053
You're right.

00:25:03,655 --> 00:25:05,924
Tommy deserved better.

00:25:05,924 --> 00:25:07,893
A lot better.

00:25:12,798 --> 00:25:15,667
(sobbing)

00:25:15,667 --> 00:25:18,003
(sighs)

00:25:18,003 --> 00:25:19,704
This is embarrassing.

00:25:19,704 --> 00:25:20,839
Sorry.

00:25:23,175 --> 00:25:26,711
Here you go.
Why don't you take that?

00:25:26,711 --> 00:25:28,980
I'll tell you what.
Why don't we back up

00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,882
and tell me how this whole day
started, all right?

00:25:30,882 --> 00:25:32,984
It was a 51's game, right?

00:25:32,984 --> 00:25:36,721
We, um... we both played
in high school, and...

00:25:38,557 --> 00:25:40,859
Tommy was a hell
of a first baseman.

00:25:40,859 --> 00:25:43,028
Yeah, I played in
college little bit.

00:25:43,028 --> 00:25:44,496
I wasn't very good.

00:25:44,496 --> 00:25:46,865
What about you?
Were you any good?

00:25:46,865 --> 00:25:49,901
He's not playing good cop
right now, is he?

00:25:49,901 --> 00:25:51,203
No. That's what
I'm talking about.

00:25:51,203 --> 00:25:53,138
They all think
they're social workers.

00:25:53,138 --> 00:25:54,739
They are good, though.

00:25:54,739 --> 00:25:57,042
Yeah, but that's not the point.

00:25:57,042 --> 00:25:58,877
I know. I know.

00:25:58,877 --> 00:26:01,880
JIMMY: ...medication,
and, uh...

00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,748
I like Nick.

00:26:03,748 --> 00:26:05,183
...I went down to play
a little black jack.

00:26:05,183 --> 00:26:07,686
I'd hate to lose him.

00:26:10,722 --> 00:26:13,191
(speaking Norwegian)

00:26:13,191 --> 00:26:15,026
Hey.

00:26:15,026 --> 00:26:17,662
Oh, hey, I uh, ran
into Morgan Brody today.

00:26:17,662 --> 00:26:19,097
She's really...

00:26:19,097 --> 00:26:21,666
What are you watching, Greg?
Norwegian YouTube.

00:26:21,666 --> 00:26:23,668
So, our Shar-Pei Doe
got me thinking.

00:26:23,668 --> 00:26:26,638
He's a deer hunter, right?
Like a long line of Sanders men.

00:26:26,638 --> 00:26:28,106
Don't worry, the bucks
stop with me.

00:26:28,106 --> 00:26:32,911
But meet my cousin Jerker
from Nesoddtangen.

00:26:32,911 --> 00:26:34,946
He's got this deer-skinning
technique that uses

00:26:34,946 --> 00:26:38,450
an air compressor to separate
the skin from the muscle.

00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:39,818
That is disgusting.

00:26:39,818 --> 00:26:41,820
Well, that also
might be our COD.

00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:44,122
Our vic had a puncture
wound in his torso.

00:26:44,122 --> 00:26:46,591
I'm thinking he was "Hulked."

00:26:46,591 --> 00:26:48,193
You mean like inflated.

00:26:48,193 --> 00:26:51,696
It's possible. Probably
take one big-ass air compressor.

00:26:51,696 --> 00:26:54,599
You know, you and your cousin
Jerker may be on to something.

00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:56,168
It's <i>Jerker.</i>

00:26:56,168 --> 00:26:58,103
The trace report
on the black residue

00:26:58,103 --> 00:27:01,006
we found on our deer hater--
polyalphaolefin.

00:27:01,006 --> 00:27:02,974
It's a lubricating oil.
It also kind of sounds
Norwegian.

00:27:02,974 --> 00:27:05,944
It's found in commercial
air compressors,

00:27:05,944 --> 00:27:09,981
like the ones they use in truck
stops to fill big rig tires.

00:27:09,981 --> 00:27:11,216
And I think there's a truck stop

00:27:11,216 --> 00:27:12,584
a few miles
from our crime scene.

00:27:19,858 --> 00:27:23,428
Your jacket
is impressive.

00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:29,834
So, uh, what
was it this time?

00:27:29,834 --> 00:27:31,703
I think you know.

00:27:33,605 --> 00:27:36,975
Langston fallout...

00:27:36,975 --> 00:27:38,977
it had a far reach.

00:27:42,547 --> 00:27:45,917
There are hundreds of other
crime labs in this country.

00:27:45,917 --> 00:27:49,020
This one's the best.

00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,856
It's your call.

00:28:10,175 --> 00:28:11,610
Hey, Nick.

00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:13,578
Let me talk to
you for a second.

00:28:13,578 --> 00:28:16,114
Yeah, sure.

00:28:16,114 --> 00:28:20,452
Look, I don't know how things
were done before I got here,

00:28:20,452 --> 00:28:22,153
and I like to think of myself

00:28:22,153 --> 00:28:23,822
as an easygoing
kind of guy.

00:28:23,822 --> 00:28:25,724
Mm-hmm.
I like it that way.

00:28:25,724 --> 00:28:28,660
But when I ask for something,
I expect to get it.

00:28:30,729 --> 00:28:33,932
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.

00:28:33,932 --> 00:28:36,568
I'm still working on my field
investigation report.

00:28:36,568 --> 00:28:38,470
I don't see a pen in your hand.

00:28:40,572 --> 00:28:42,574
All right, man,
I'll give you the report,

00:28:42,574 --> 00:28:44,843
but it's not gonna have
the right answers in it.

00:28:44,843 --> 00:28:47,045
It's a start. It's a form of
communication,

00:28:47,045 --> 00:28:50,081
and I shouldn't have to chase
you down here to get it.

00:28:52,617 --> 00:28:54,953
Yeah, you're right.
It won't happen again.

00:28:54,953 --> 00:28:56,688
Oh, it probably will.

00:28:58,423 --> 00:29:00,659
Hey, college baseball, huh?

00:29:00,659 --> 00:29:02,761
Yeah, how'd you know that?

00:29:02,761 --> 00:29:06,197
Well, I watched you get
all cozy with our suspect.

00:29:10,702 --> 00:29:12,804
Why don't we talk about
the tram ride, instead?

00:29:12,804 --> 00:29:14,806
I was a pretty lousy
baseball player.

00:29:14,806 --> 00:29:17,909
I think that'd be a good idea.

00:29:17,909 --> 00:29:21,446
Okay, 73 seconds
station to station.

00:29:21,446 --> 00:29:24,015
And in that time frame,
Tom Finnerty is stabbed.

00:29:24,015 --> 00:29:26,985
We assume the cowboy sees Jimmy
with the knife,

00:29:26,985 --> 00:29:28,653
(gunshots)
pulls out his gun.

00:29:28,653 --> 00:29:30,588
Security guard sees that,
pulls out his.

00:29:30,588 --> 00:29:32,090
Bullets start flying.

00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:34,693
Both the security guard
and the cowboy get hit.

00:29:34,693 --> 00:29:37,896
And the mom's collateral damage.
Now, that part is in my report.

00:29:37,896 --> 00:29:40,165
I'm glad to hear that. Okay.
So we know what they did.

00:29:40,165 --> 00:29:41,866
We don't need them anymore.

00:29:41,866 --> 00:29:43,968
Adios, folks.

00:29:43,968 --> 00:29:45,970
That leaves the stabbing.

00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:48,473
But now, you don't think that
your best friend Jimmy did it.

00:29:48,473 --> 00:29:53,011
Red Dress said
Jimmy stabbed his brother.

00:29:53,011 --> 00:29:55,480
Jimmy said he was only trying
to pull the knife out.

00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:58,216
Personally, I think that
she probably saw the knife

00:29:58,216 --> 00:30:01,019
in Jimmy's hand
and just filled in the rest.

00:30:01,019 --> 00:30:03,788
Okay, I'll buy it.
Red Dress can go.

00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:07,892
You're Jimmy.

00:30:07,892 --> 00:30:10,929
Yeah, and I see my brother with
a knife sticking out of his gut.

00:30:10,929 --> 00:30:12,097
I got to help him.

00:30:12,097 --> 00:30:15,500
So, I run over.

00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,502
I go to pull the knife out,

00:30:17,502 --> 00:30:20,038
and that's when
all hell breaks loose.

00:30:20,038 --> 00:30:23,508
The shooting starts as the tram
pulls to a stop.

00:30:23,508 --> 00:30:26,111
Self-preservation
kicks in.

00:30:26,111 --> 00:30:28,613
As I'm running out...

00:30:28,613 --> 00:30:33,017
I deposit two blood drops
on the door here from the knife.

00:30:33,017 --> 00:30:35,120
And we know that
that's Tom's blood.

00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,422
Yeah.

00:30:40,892 --> 00:30:43,027
Hang on now, wait a second.

00:30:43,027 --> 00:30:44,896
There's a third blood drop here,

00:30:44,896 --> 00:30:46,030
and it's different
than the others.

00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:47,799
Come take a look at this.

00:30:50,135 --> 00:30:53,138
Looks like they were all
deposited at the same time.

00:30:53,138 --> 00:30:56,040
But this droplet
has a ghost ring.

00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,843
Blood drops dry
from the outside in.

00:30:58,843 --> 00:31:01,880
It takes at least 30 seconds
to form a ghost ring.

00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:04,449
<i>If this blood came off the</i>
<i>knife as Jimmy was running out,</i>

00:31:04,449 --> 00:31:06,918
there wouldn't have been enough
time to form a ring.

00:31:06,918 --> 00:31:10,588
73 seconds
is plenty of time.

00:31:10,588 --> 00:31:13,191
<i>And the only way that could</i>
<i>have happened if it was</i>

00:31:13,191 --> 00:31:16,060
<i>on the door before</i>
<i>the tram ride even started.</i>

00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:17,629
I don't think there's any way

00:31:17,629 --> 00:31:18,997
my old pal Jimmy
could have done this.

00:31:18,997 --> 00:31:20,432
Well done, Nick.

00:31:20,432 --> 00:31:22,734
We're still looking
for a killer.

00:31:22,734 --> 00:31:25,937
Well, we do have a witness with
the best seat in the house.

00:31:25,937 --> 00:31:28,807
Oh, yeah, we do, don't we?

00:31:32,677 --> 00:31:34,946
Emmett, you're doing great.

00:31:34,946 --> 00:31:36,748
Okay, so you sat down.

00:31:36,748 --> 00:31:38,650
Tram started to fill up.

00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:41,553
I'm the guy in the 51's jersey.

00:31:41,553 --> 00:31:43,054
Come walking on.

00:31:43,054 --> 00:31:44,189
Then what?

00:31:47,025 --> 00:31:49,661
Did you see anyone
try to hurt him?

00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:53,998
No.

00:31:53,998 --> 00:31:56,868
Did anyone bump into him?

00:31:56,868 --> 00:31:59,637
No.

00:31:59,637 --> 00:32:02,774
All right, uh... what...

00:32:02,774 --> 00:32:04,476
Hey...

00:32:04,476 --> 00:32:06,878
Emmett?

00:32:06,878 --> 00:32:08,112
Oh, Emmett, what
are you doing, buddy?

00:32:08,112 --> 00:32:09,981
Where you going?

00:32:09,981 --> 00:32:11,049
You all right?

00:32:11,049 --> 00:32:12,951
What's going on?

00:32:12,951 --> 00:32:15,854
I did something bad when I was
going to the tram.

00:32:15,854 --> 00:32:17,956
Oh, okay.

00:32:17,956 --> 00:32:21,559
Well, I-I bet
it wasn't that bad.

00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:24,195
Some money fell
out of a man's pocket.

00:32:24,195 --> 00:32:27,532
It was right... right
here on the floor.

00:32:27,532 --> 00:32:30,435
I took it.

00:32:30,435 --> 00:32:32,070
Okay.

00:32:41,846 --> 00:32:43,815
Can you look for him
and give it back?

00:32:43,815 --> 00:32:47,118
Sure.
Why don't you give
it to me, Emmett?

00:32:47,118 --> 00:32:49,787
And I'll make sure it gets back
to its rightful owner, okay?

00:32:49,787 --> 00:32:51,456
Now let me ask
you something.

00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:55,627
Did that belong to the
man in the 51's jersey?

00:32:55,627 --> 00:32:58,930
No. He was smaller.

00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:00,164
Smaller. All right. Well...

00:33:00,164 --> 00:33:03,535
Well, when people
help the police,

00:33:03,535 --> 00:33:05,470
they always
get a reward.

00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:06,871
So I'm gonna make
sure that you get

00:33:06,871 --> 00:33:09,207
a brand-new one-
hundred-dollar bill.

00:33:09,207 --> 00:33:10,975
All right?

00:33:10,975 --> 00:33:13,678
And right now, I want you to
go over, and that nice lady--

00:33:13,678 --> 00:33:15,980
she's gonna buy you
an ice-cream cone.

00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,916
All right?

00:33:20,151 --> 00:33:22,020
If this blood's Tom Finnerty's,

00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:24,055
he was definitely stabbed
before he got on that tram.

00:33:24,055 --> 00:33:26,057
But he couldn't have been
stabbed on the platform here

00:33:26,057 --> 00:33:28,059
or in the casino,
or we would've

00:33:28,059 --> 00:33:30,161
seen that on the
surveillance cameras.

00:33:30,161 --> 00:33:32,163
You know,

00:33:32,163 --> 00:33:35,733
I'm thinking they don't have
surveillance in bathrooms.

00:33:55,887 --> 00:33:57,121
Oh, yeah.

00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:03,127
I think we just found where
Tom Finnerty was stabbed.

00:34:11,035 --> 00:34:12,704
SIDLE:
<i>It's quite an operation</i>
<i>you run, Mr. Gibbs.</i>

00:34:12,704 --> 00:34:15,540
Service over 30 trucks a day.

00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:18,042
Found this picture on your wall.

00:34:18,042 --> 00:34:19,877
Who's your
hunting pal?

00:34:19,877 --> 00:34:21,746
That's Del Hartley.

00:34:21,746 --> 00:34:24,182
Have you seen
Del lately?

00:34:24,182 --> 00:34:26,150
Think he's
on a fishing trip.

00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,989
Nice air compressor.

00:34:30,989 --> 00:34:32,790
Who has the key?

00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:34,525
Me.

00:34:34,525 --> 00:34:35,893
You forgot
to clean it.

00:34:35,893 --> 00:34:38,062
Tested positive for human blood.

00:34:38,062 --> 00:34:40,131
SIDLE:
I got a feeling
that the DNA will be

00:34:40,131 --> 00:34:42,033
a match to Del.
How about you?

00:34:42,033 --> 00:34:44,602
When you were cleaning up,
you missed a button.

00:34:47,805 --> 00:34:49,140
It was an accident.

00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:51,542
I swear.

00:34:51,542 --> 00:34:52,777
We had a deer come to.

00:34:54,012 --> 00:34:55,480
It happens.

00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,215
Del tried to restrain it,

00:34:57,215 --> 00:34:59,517
but he forgot
that the deer had a weapon.

00:34:59,517 --> 00:35:00,818
The deer was
carrying?

00:35:00,818 --> 00:35:02,587
Yeah. Ten points.

00:35:04,155 --> 00:35:07,125
Del, I'm gonna
pop some holes in here.

00:35:09,093 --> 00:35:10,962
<i>Del gets cut,</i>

00:35:10,962 --> 00:35:12,997
<i>and he's worried about</i>

00:35:12,997 --> 00:35:15,900
<i>rabies or-or deer worm</i>
<i>or something.</i>

00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:18,636
<i>He grabs the nozzle</i>
<i>to clean the wound.</i>

00:35:18,636 --> 00:35:20,038
<i>Seemed to make sense.</i>

00:35:20,038 --> 00:35:21,639
Oh, God!

00:35:21,639 --> 00:35:25,143
<i>It got stuck</i>
<i>with the nozzle on.</i>

00:35:25,143 --> 00:35:29,647
<i>Air's blowing in his body; his</i>
<i>body's popping off his muscles.</i>

00:35:29,647 --> 00:35:33,951
<i>And I yank the thing out,</i>
<i>and he's dead.</i>

00:35:37,055 --> 00:35:39,957
He was my friend,
but I got a... a business.

00:35:39,957 --> 00:35:42,560
I can't have dead bodies
lying around.

00:35:45,096 --> 00:35:47,732
And, uh, it was...

00:35:47,732 --> 00:35:49,867
it was out of season.

00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:53,871
I think poaching is probably

00:35:53,871 --> 00:35:55,673
the least of your problems
right now.

00:35:57,775 --> 00:35:59,977
Yeah.

00:35:59,977 --> 00:36:02,213
DNA confirms that
the blood on the money

00:36:02,213 --> 00:36:05,450
as well as the stall door
was Tom Finnerty's.

00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:09,487
And I went through the ID logs
from all of the Palermo's ATMs.

00:36:09,487 --> 00:36:11,656
At 12:53 a.m.,

00:36:11,656 --> 00:36:14,592
our bloody hundred was spit out
from Tom's account.

00:36:14,592 --> 00:36:16,728
(phone beeps)
That was right before
he got on the tram.

00:36:16,728 --> 00:36:18,763
Hold on a sec.
All right.

00:36:18,763 --> 00:36:21,599
Print came back
to an Allen Krick.

00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:23,167
Why do I know
that guy?

00:36:25,603 --> 00:36:26,938
Because I talked to him.

00:36:26,938 --> 00:36:28,706
He was in
the next tram car.

00:36:28,706 --> 00:36:30,508
BRASS:
<i>Krick is in the wind.</i>

00:36:30,508 --> 00:36:32,610
The address he gave is bogus.

00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:34,512
We're checking the hotels now.

00:36:34,512 --> 00:36:36,180
I found
an interesting connection

00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,715
between Krick
and Jimmy Finnerty.

00:36:37,715 --> 00:36:39,484
They were partners in crime.

00:36:39,484 --> 00:36:41,853
They were busted in a chop shop
scam in Tahoe in '07.

00:36:41,853 --> 00:36:44,655
Krick got two to five;
Jimmy got the hell out of town.

00:36:44,655 --> 00:36:46,691
Took the money and ran.

00:36:46,691 --> 00:36:48,559
Of course he couldn't
stay out of trouble.

00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:49,894
When did Krick get out?

00:36:49,894 --> 00:36:52,563
He was paroled from NCC
five days ago.

00:36:52,563 --> 00:36:53,731
Thank you.

00:36:53,731 --> 00:36:56,467
I'm sorry, but NCC?
What...?

00:36:56,467 --> 00:36:58,202
It's the correctional facility
in Carson City.

00:36:58,202 --> 00:37:00,071
Okay.

00:37:00,071 --> 00:37:02,173
Which is exactly where his day
started out yesterday.

00:37:02,173 --> 00:37:03,741
We were able to obtain

00:37:03,741 --> 00:37:05,443
Krick's phone records.

00:37:05,443 --> 00:37:06,811
He had a long day,
made quite the drive.

00:37:06,811 --> 00:37:08,679
Carson City at noon.

00:37:08,679 --> 00:37:11,549
Yerington by 2:00.

00:37:11,549 --> 00:37:12,984
Now, that's when
he first called Jimmy.

00:37:12,984 --> 00:37:14,185
Went straight
to voice mail.

00:37:14,185 --> 00:37:16,554
About 4:00, he was in Hawthorne.

00:37:16,554 --> 00:37:17,955
And then by 5:00,

00:37:17,955 --> 00:37:19,991
he was all the way down
in Indian Springs.

00:37:19,991 --> 00:37:21,459
Called again

00:37:21,459 --> 00:37:22,527
and straight to voice mail.

00:37:22,527 --> 00:37:24,695
Now, the last
hit was at

00:37:24,695 --> 00:37:26,164
a cell phone tower
on Flamingo Road.

00:37:26,164 --> 00:37:27,899
That's just four blocks
from the Golden Nugget.

00:37:27,899 --> 00:37:29,000
Where Jimmy was staying.

00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:29,934
Right.

00:37:31,736 --> 00:37:34,639
WILLOWS:
He drives all that way,

00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:36,541
but when Krick
finally gets here,

00:37:36,541 --> 00:37:37,742
he kills the brother.

00:37:39,577 --> 00:37:40,511
Why?

00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,588
What are you looking at?

00:37:50,588 --> 00:37:51,989
The Big Dipper?

00:37:51,989 --> 00:37:53,891
The last thing Tom Finnerty saw

00:37:53,891 --> 00:37:54,926
before he died:

00:37:54,926 --> 00:37:57,461
his brother.

00:37:57,461 --> 00:37:58,796
Let me, let me try this.

00:37:58,796 --> 00:38:00,431
Okay, so--

00:38:00,431 --> 00:38:01,833
Oh, yi.

00:38:01,833 --> 00:38:02,834
Head rush.

00:38:02,834 --> 00:38:05,169
Okay.

00:38:05,169 --> 00:38:07,905
Tom's dying of cancer,
and yet he flies 3,000 miles

00:38:07,905 --> 00:38:10,007
to be with his screwup brother.

00:38:10,007 --> 00:38:13,544
He gets stabbed, and he
walks another 300 feet

00:38:13,544 --> 00:38:15,580
just so he can
be with him at the end.

00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:19,217
So, where does Krick
fit into all this walking?

00:38:19,217 --> 00:38:22,687
Jimmy pulls a knife out of Tom
trying to save his life,

00:38:22,687 --> 00:38:27,425
and Tom pulls cash out of
an ATM to try to save Jimmy.

00:38:27,425 --> 00:38:28,860
I'm with her.
Where's this going?

00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:29,994
Krick's phone records, right?

00:38:29,994 --> 00:38:31,195
Follow it all the way through.

00:38:31,195 --> 00:38:33,097
All day long,
from Carson City

00:38:33,097 --> 00:38:36,434
to Vegas,
Krick's calling Jimmy, right?

00:38:36,434 --> 00:38:37,735
Over and over, getting closer.

00:38:37,735 --> 00:38:38,936
Obviously, he wants something.

00:38:38,936 --> 00:38:40,538
That's why he's at the Palermo,

00:38:40,538 --> 00:38:42,440
why he's
shadowing Jimmy.

00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:45,776
But-but Tom is with Jimmy.

00:38:45,776 --> 00:38:48,012
And what did Jimmy tell you
about-about big brother?

00:38:48,012 --> 00:38:51,015
That he spent a lifetime
looking out for little brother.

00:38:51,015 --> 00:38:55,887
Yeah. See, I think
Tom saw Krick first.

00:38:55,887 --> 00:38:57,889
And given
Jimmy's past,

00:38:57,889 --> 00:39:01,459
you got to figure little
bro owes Krick big money.

00:39:01,459 --> 00:39:06,530
So, Tom gets money out of the
ATM, and when Jimmy's distracted

00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:10,735
by a hot red dress, he follows
Krick into the men's room.

00:39:10,735 --> 00:39:13,704
Hey, look, let me
make this all go away.

00:39:13,704 --> 00:39:15,039
I don't need
your money.

00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:16,774
I need the last five
years of my life back.

00:39:16,774 --> 00:39:17,942
You stay out of it.

00:39:17,942 --> 00:39:19,076
This is between
Jimmy and me!

00:39:19,076 --> 00:39:20,177
Now it's between
you and me.

00:39:20,177 --> 00:39:21,579
Bitch, get out
of the way!

00:39:21,579 --> 00:39:22,580
Hey, hey, hey.

00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:24,215
(groaning)

00:39:28,586 --> 00:39:30,087
(panting)

00:39:34,058 --> 00:39:35,593
Oh, man.

00:39:37,828 --> 00:39:39,797
He was trying to clean up
another one of my messes.

00:39:39,797 --> 00:39:40,831
What about Krick?

00:39:40,831 --> 00:39:42,833
You know where he is?

00:39:42,833 --> 00:39:44,568
I'm not telling you that.

00:39:46,003 --> 00:39:48,506
I roll, he rolls,
I do serious time.

00:39:48,506 --> 00:39:50,174
I'm not, I'm not
doing that again.

00:39:50,174 --> 00:39:53,144
Okay, so you're gonna cover for
the guy who killed your brother.

00:39:53,144 --> 00:39:54,912
Who died stepping
up for you.

00:39:54,912 --> 00:39:56,547
Don't you think
it's time

00:39:56,547 --> 00:39:58,449
you stepped up for him
just a little bit here?

00:40:02,553 --> 00:40:04,588
Krick's got a girl
in Boulder City.

00:40:19,036 --> 00:40:20,838
Thanks.

00:40:20,838 --> 00:40:22,039
Thank you, Emmett.

00:40:22,039 --> 00:40:24,041
That was a really good thing
you did.

00:40:24,041 --> 00:40:28,012
Make sure you spend it
all in one place now.

00:40:30,114 --> 00:40:31,482
You like basketball?

00:40:31,482 --> 00:40:32,750
Yeah.
Well, I got a,

00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:34,885
I got a boy,
little bigger than you.

00:40:34,885 --> 00:40:36,721
Plays college ball here.

00:40:36,721 --> 00:40:39,156
Maybe the next time
you and your mom are in town,

00:40:39,156 --> 00:40:41,058
we could go to a game together.

00:40:41,058 --> 00:40:43,561
You like that?

00:40:43,561 --> 00:40:45,830
Okay.

00:40:48,199 --> 00:40:49,600
Brass picked up Krick.

00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,035
Genius still had
the blood money on him.

00:40:51,035 --> 00:40:52,636
That's real smart.

00:40:52,636 --> 00:40:54,171
Yeah, I called
Jimmy's probation officer.

00:40:54,171 --> 00:40:56,707
Tried to get him
to cut Jimmy a little slack.

00:40:56,707 --> 00:40:58,109
This will be his
third strike.

00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:02,880
Call him back.

00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,615
What do you mean?

00:41:04,615 --> 00:41:08,219
I mean that we are doing things
by the book now.

00:41:08,219 --> 00:41:10,121
What book, Catherine?

00:41:10,121 --> 00:41:11,989
I'm just trying to
help the guy out.

00:41:11,989 --> 00:41:13,891
You're not listening, Nick.

00:41:13,891 --> 00:41:15,826
There are no more
under-the-table deals,

00:41:15,826 --> 00:41:17,661
no more going rogue,

00:41:17,661 --> 00:41:20,631
no more personal vendettas,
no more L.A.

00:41:20,631 --> 00:41:22,700
Now, what does this
have to do with L.A.?

00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:24,769
I wouldn't change anything
about what I did there.

00:41:24,769 --> 00:41:25,770
I would!

00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:27,571
I'm not in charge anymore,

00:41:27,571 --> 00:41:29,707
because this is our problem.

00:41:29,707 --> 00:41:31,742
We lead with our hearts
instead of our heads.

00:41:31,742 --> 00:41:33,811
And then we justify it
after the fact.

00:41:33,811 --> 00:41:36,614
Why you so pissed off?

00:41:36,614 --> 00:41:37,815
I got demoted, Nick!

00:41:37,815 --> 00:41:39,583
I got demoted!

00:41:39,583 --> 00:41:41,652
I mean, you're setting up shop
here in the break room,

00:41:41,652 --> 00:41:44,622
and D.B. Moonbeam
is running the show.

00:41:44,622 --> 00:41:47,558
And you know what, maybe he's
just what this team needed.

00:41:47,558 --> 00:41:49,560
STOKES:
I disagree. It's not
what this team needed,

00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,928
it's what Ecklie
and the sheriff...

00:41:50,928 --> 00:41:54,899
Hey, sweetheart,
I'm just leaving.

00:41:54,899 --> 00:41:57,435
Yeah. How was your day?

00:41:57,435 --> 00:41:59,437
WILLOWS: You always blame
other people for what
you're responsible for.

00:41:59,437 --> 00:42:00,938
Stop with the excuses.
Don't give me
that, Catherine!

00:42:00,938 --> 00:42:03,808
Think the team is
really starting to...

00:42:03,808 --> 00:42:05,576
Well, you can add me
to that list.

00:42:05,576 --> 00:42:07,011
...starting to gel.

00:42:07,011 --> 00:42:08,979
Honey, I'm gonna,
um, I'm gonna go.

00:42:08,979 --> 00:42:10,114
I need another hour.

00:42:10,114 --> 00:42:11,916
I'm sorry.

00:42:11,916 --> 00:42:14,718
19 years is a very long time
to be doing this job.

00:42:14,718 --> 00:42:15,853
What are you trying to say?

00:42:15,853 --> 00:42:16,954
What am I trying to say?

00:42:16,954 --> 00:42:17,955
Well, I'm saying that this team

00:42:17,955 --> 00:42:19,156
has to move on.

00:42:19,156 --> 00:42:21,058
We got to get back
to what we do best.

00:42:21,058 --> 00:42:22,478
And if you can't
handle that,

00:42:22,478 --> 00:42:23,748
then, you know,
there's the door.

00:42:23,748 --> 00:42:26,284
I know where the door is.
I've used it a couple times.

00:42:26,284 --> 00:42:28,519
(cell phones ringing, beeps)
