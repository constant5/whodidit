00:09:37,847 --> 00:09:40,749
That's what you were doing
on the phone with your daughter?

00:09:40,749 --> 00:09:41,917
Yes.

00:09:41,917 --> 00:09:43,786
That's just sleep deprivation.

00:09:43,786 --> 00:09:45,154
Strap him into the car.

00:09:45,154 --> 00:09:46,522
Take him for a drive.

00:09:46,522 --> 00:09:48,257
I'm sure that will put him
to sleep.

00:09:48,257 --> 00:09:50,226
Well, did he nap today?

00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:56,498
RUSSELL:
<i>Stems were still moist.</i>

00:09:56,498 --> 00:09:58,167
<i>Just been pruned.</i>

00:09:58,167 --> 00:09:59,869
There was a pile
of brown leaves

00:09:59,869 --> 00:10:02,605
on the table--about 20 minutes
worth, as a matter of fact.

00:10:02,605 --> 00:10:04,573
Best way to keep
geraniums in bloom.

00:10:04,573 --> 00:10:05,875
Ah. I knew there was a secret.

00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:07,276
You know what to do, right?

00:10:07,276 --> 00:10:10,579
Test for chlorophyll.

00:10:10,579 --> 00:10:12,214
BRASS: <i>How are things</i>
<i>between you and Judy?</i>

00:10:12,214 --> 00:10:13,916
Solid.

00:10:16,819 --> 00:10:18,821
Did you know the victim,
Dan Traxler?

00:10:18,821 --> 00:10:20,789
No.
Your wife knew him.

00:10:20,789 --> 00:10:22,591
Judy's friends
with a lot of people.

00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:24,760
We found an ATM
receipt last night

00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,529
with a large
cash withdrawal.

00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:29,798
Judy has girls' night out
on Tuesdays.

00:10:29,798 --> 00:10:31,834
Except, last night,
she stayed in.

00:10:31,834 --> 00:10:35,471
Are you investigating
this incident, Jim, or my wife?

00:10:35,471 --> 00:10:37,606
Look, Al, you know,
you're not the only guy

00:10:37,606 --> 00:10:39,642
to get blindsided.

00:10:39,642 --> 00:10:42,611
My ex-wife screwed around
on me for a year.

00:10:42,611 --> 00:10:43,879
Me. Go figure.

00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:46,315
That's your marriage, not mine.

00:10:46,315 --> 00:10:47,316
Oh, okay.

00:10:47,316 --> 00:10:48,517
Well, consider this.

00:10:48,517 --> 00:10:50,185
They're drinking wine.

00:10:50,185 --> 00:10:52,354
They went from the living
room to the bedroom.

00:10:52,354 --> 00:10:54,323
I don't believe
it was like that.

00:10:54,323 --> 00:10:56,625
All right, look, this is more
information than I'm prepared

00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:58,627
to give you anyway, okay,
but I see a pattern here.

00:10:58,627 --> 00:11:01,196
Judy's night out was
Traxler's night in.

00:11:01,196 --> 00:11:03,532
Th-There's got to be
more than that.

00:11:03,532 --> 00:11:06,335
Look, as my friend,
I am asking you to broaden

00:11:06,335 --> 00:11:08,237
the scope of your
investigation.

00:11:08,237 --> 00:11:10,239
You gotta prepare
yourself, Al.

00:11:10,239 --> 00:11:12,374
because this is only
gonna get worse.

00:11:12,374 --> 00:11:14,443
No, you gotta prepare
yourself to be wrong.

00:11:14,443 --> 00:11:16,378
Your past is clouding
your judgment,

00:11:16,378 --> 00:11:18,347
and I expect more
than that from you.

00:11:24,219 --> 00:11:26,822
You okay?

00:11:26,822 --> 00:11:28,557
Want to take a minute?

00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:37,199
Dr. Sloane...

00:11:37,199 --> 00:11:38,834
what do we know?

00:11:38,834 --> 00:11:42,538
Daniel Traxler is an otherwise
healthy adult male.

00:11:42,538 --> 00:11:43,806
No traumatic injuries.

00:11:43,806 --> 00:11:45,140
No lacerations.

00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,208
No broken bones.

00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:47,343
Heart tissue
shows no signs

00:11:47,343 --> 00:11:48,644
of ischemia
or infarction.

00:11:48,644 --> 00:11:50,379
So, no heart attack?

00:11:50,379 --> 00:11:51,714
SLOANE:
I sent blood samples

00:11:51,714 --> 00:11:53,849
to Tox, tissue sections
to Histo-Path.

00:11:53,849 --> 00:11:57,152
And the penile swab?

00:11:57,152 --> 00:11:58,253
Sent it to DNA.

00:11:58,253 --> 00:11:59,688
Did anything present?

00:11:59,688 --> 00:12:02,391
(heavy sigh)

00:12:02,391 --> 00:12:04,626
Just this.

00:12:07,296 --> 00:12:08,931
ROBBINS:
Frenulum is torn.

00:12:08,931 --> 00:12:11,200
That explains the
blood in his mouth.

00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,935
RUSSELL:
He was smothered.

00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,743
I'm sorry, Al.

00:12:20,743 --> 00:12:22,678
This looks like a homicide.

00:12:33,722 --> 00:12:35,758
Smothering is passive.

00:12:35,758 --> 00:12:37,693
It's got female
written all over it.

00:12:37,693 --> 00:12:40,162
Can you just process
the bathroom?

00:12:40,162 --> 00:12:42,498
(shutter clicking)

00:12:42,498 --> 00:12:44,333
You know, if it was
anybody else,

00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:46,368
I'd buy the whole
cheating wife thing, but...

00:12:46,368 --> 00:12:47,903
it's Doc.

00:12:47,903 --> 00:12:49,605
He's amazing.

00:12:49,605 --> 00:12:52,608
<i>Nothing ever slows him down.</i>

00:12:52,608 --> 00:12:55,544
<i>He's got this great</i>
<i>outlook on life.</i>

00:12:59,481 --> 00:13:01,650
And every day he comes home

00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:03,752
and takes off his legs.

00:13:13,562 --> 00:13:16,498
HODGES:
Sildenafil. Wow.

00:13:16,498 --> 00:13:18,434
At least he's keeping up
his end of the bargain.

00:13:18,434 --> 00:13:20,536
Why would Judy
do this to him?

00:13:20,536 --> 00:13:21,804
SANDERS:
Don't the Robbins

00:13:21,804 --> 00:13:23,639
have a cat--a gray tabby?

00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:25,274
(shutter clicks)

00:13:25,274 --> 00:13:27,643
Yeah. Her name's Cinder.

00:13:27,643 --> 00:13:29,778
The reason I know that
is because that's the name of

00:13:29,778 --> 00:13:31,914
my first cat, who,
ironically, died in a fire

00:13:31,914 --> 00:13:33,615
of mysterious origins.

00:13:33,615 --> 00:13:36,518
My stepfather was
allergic to cats.

00:13:36,518 --> 00:13:38,520
I found a box of condoms
under the sink where Doc

00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,355
couldn't see them.
At least Judy cared enough

00:13:40,355 --> 00:13:41,824
about him not
to give him a disease

00:13:41,824 --> 00:13:43,358
while she was
screwing around.

00:13:43,358 --> 00:13:45,194
Hodges, you need to
shift it into neutral.

00:13:45,194 --> 00:13:48,163
I'm gonna go look
for that litter box.

00:13:48,163 --> 00:13:50,599
♪ ♪

00:14:19,528 --> 00:14:21,730
(rattling)
Cinder?

00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:22,798
Hey,

00:14:22,798 --> 00:14:23,899
have you seen that cat?

00:14:23,899 --> 00:14:25,567
I think I spooked it.
Yeah.

00:14:25,567 --> 00:14:27,536
He, uh, ran in that room.

00:14:27,536 --> 00:14:29,438
What have you got?

00:14:29,438 --> 00:14:31,807
Carpet impressions, but...

00:14:31,807 --> 00:14:33,842
they're not the
same shape or size

00:14:33,842 --> 00:14:35,410
as anything else in the room.

00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:37,546
Maybe it's a table or a lamp.

00:14:37,546 --> 00:14:39,281
Then it would've
blocked the pathway

00:14:39,281 --> 00:14:40,382
to the sofa.

00:14:40,382 --> 00:14:41,683
SANDERS:
Well, whatever it was,

00:14:41,683 --> 00:14:43,619
it's not here now.

00:14:43,619 --> 00:14:45,354
BRASS:
So, Judy...

00:14:45,354 --> 00:14:47,422
Tell me more
about Dan Traxler.

00:14:47,422 --> 00:14:49,558
Uh, he was a-a genealogist.

00:14:49,558 --> 00:14:51,727
I found him online when I
was looking for somebody

00:14:51,727 --> 00:14:53,228
to do Al's family tree.

00:14:53,228 --> 00:14:54,429
And when did
the affair start?

00:14:54,429 --> 00:14:56,698
There was no affair.
Come on.

00:14:56,698 --> 00:14:59,401
The lingerie, candles,
romantic music...

00:14:59,401 --> 00:15:01,503
Al and I like to keep
things interesting.

00:15:01,503 --> 00:15:03,238
Judy, you're not here
because, you know,

00:15:03,238 --> 00:15:05,240
you're having an affair.
I really don't care.

00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,276
You're here because
it's a homicide.

00:15:07,276 --> 00:15:09,811
I did not cheat
on my husband

00:15:09,811 --> 00:15:12,514
and I did not kill Dan.

00:15:12,514 --> 00:15:14,683
Am I free to go?

00:15:14,683 --> 00:15:16,418
Nope.

00:15:38,373 --> 00:15:41,677
These marks were left
on your living room rug.

00:15:41,677 --> 00:15:43,712
Do you know what
made them?

00:15:43,712 --> 00:15:45,514
No.

00:15:45,514 --> 00:15:47,282
BRASS: Judy, whoever
you're protecting,

00:15:47,282 --> 00:15:49,785
it's not gonna matter
in the end.

00:15:49,785 --> 00:15:51,920
Albert, I can't
let you see her

00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,622
until I've confirmed
your alibi.

00:15:53,622 --> 00:15:56,625
Captain, I-I'd like to ask
Mrs. Robbins a question,

00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:58,594
if that's cool with you.

00:15:58,594 --> 00:16:01,496
As long as you don't pass notes
from your new best friend.

00:16:06,501 --> 00:16:08,237
BRODY: Did Mr. Traxler
bring anything

00:16:08,237 --> 00:16:09,571
to the house with him?

00:16:09,571 --> 00:16:11,607
Uh, yes. He, uh...

00:16:11,607 --> 00:16:13,809
brought a-a-a briefcase.

00:16:13,809 --> 00:16:15,877
We didn't find
a briefcase.

00:16:15,877 --> 00:16:18,180
He definitely brought
it into the house.

00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,514
Was there anyone
else in the house

00:16:19,514 --> 00:16:20,782
besides you and Mr. Traxler?

00:16:20,782 --> 00:16:22,384
Yes.

00:16:22,384 --> 00:16:23,452
Whoever killed him.

00:16:27,256 --> 00:16:29,258
Hey.
You were married.

00:16:29,258 --> 00:16:31,260
Do you think it's odd
that our dead genealogist

00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,761
was on Judy's
side of the bed?

00:16:32,761 --> 00:16:34,396
Well...

00:16:34,396 --> 00:16:36,265
you choose a side
early on in a relationship,

00:16:36,265 --> 00:16:37,599
and you pretty much
stay there,

00:16:37,599 --> 00:16:39,534
unless you're...

00:16:39,534 --> 00:16:42,204
mixing it up with
some extracurricular.

00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,507
Did you find semen?

00:16:45,507 --> 00:16:46,808
Yeah.

00:16:46,808 --> 00:16:48,877
Henry's testing it now.

00:16:48,877 --> 00:16:51,413
We think that Traxler
might have had a briefcase.

00:16:51,413 --> 00:16:53,282
Only, Morgan and I

00:16:53,282 --> 00:16:55,150
weren't able to find
one at the scene.

00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,518
Judy have time to ditch it?

00:16:56,518 --> 00:16:58,320
I don't see how she could.

00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,422
She was on the phone for 20
minutes with her daughter.

00:17:00,422 --> 00:17:02,724
Two minutes later
she called Traxler's cell,

00:17:02,724 --> 00:17:04,559
and a minute after that,
911.

00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,795
And they kept her on the phone
until a patrol showed up.

00:17:06,795 --> 00:17:09,431
Besides, why would she
ditch his briefcase,

00:17:09,431 --> 00:17:11,433
but not blow out the
candles in the bedroom,

00:17:11,433 --> 00:17:13,902
or turn off the
Marvin Gaye?

00:17:13,902 --> 00:17:15,404
(sighs)
Wow.

00:17:15,404 --> 00:17:16,805
Marvin Gaye?

00:17:16,805 --> 00:17:18,307
"Sexual Healing"?

00:17:18,307 --> 00:17:20,309
Why else would you
play Marvin Gaye?

00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:22,878
Well, if that
briefcase is missing,

00:17:22,878 --> 00:17:24,579
it had to be
important to someone.

00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:27,382
You need to find out more
about your dead genealogist.

00:17:29,451 --> 00:17:32,854
And always get permission
from the church

00:17:32,854 --> 00:17:35,624
or the cemetery administrator

00:17:35,624 --> 00:17:37,826
before you start
any grave rubbing.

00:17:37,826 --> 00:17:39,594
WOMAN: Doesn't friction
damage the stone?

00:17:39,594 --> 00:17:41,730
Yes, it can.

00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:44,499
That's why I use
synthetic rice paper

00:17:44,499 --> 00:17:46,802
and light, even strokes.

00:17:46,802 --> 00:17:48,370
There, okay?

00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:50,238
All right, you guys
go out and do it.

00:17:50,238 --> 00:17:51,740
Have fun.
Okay, thank you.

00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,775
You bet.

00:17:53,775 --> 00:17:55,310
Donna Hoppe?

00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,745
Yeah?

00:17:56,745 --> 00:17:58,814
Your secretary told me
you would be here.

00:17:58,814 --> 00:18:01,516
My name is Greg Sanders; I'm
with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.

00:18:01,516 --> 00:18:03,385
Sanders? that's
Americanized, right?

00:18:03,385 --> 00:18:04,586
Yeah.

00:18:04,586 --> 00:18:06,588
Shortened from Sanderson.

00:18:06,588 --> 00:18:08,256
My father's side was

00:18:08,256 --> 00:18:10,592
from Harstad, Norway.
And your mother's?

00:18:10,592 --> 00:18:11,660
Hojems.

00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,861
From Oslo.

00:18:12,861 --> 00:18:14,563
How many were named Olaf?

00:18:14,563 --> 00:18:18,667
My grandfather was
Olaf Hojem the eighth.

00:18:18,667 --> 00:18:21,803
(laughs)
You should hyphenate.

00:18:21,803 --> 00:18:23,905
Hojem is an infinitely

00:18:23,905 --> 00:18:26,575
more interesting name
than Sanders.

00:18:26,575 --> 00:18:29,277
But if you wanted
a genealogy lesson,

00:18:29,277 --> 00:18:31,546
you should have shown up
earlier, for my seminar.

00:18:31,546 --> 00:18:35,417
Actually, I'm here
on other business.

00:18:35,417 --> 00:18:38,920
Mrs. Hoppe, I'm very sorry
to tell you this,

00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,922
but your business partner,
Dan Traxler,

00:18:40,922 --> 00:18:42,457
was killed last night.

00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,561
Oh, my God.

00:18:46,561 --> 00:18:48,296
How?

00:18:48,296 --> 00:18:50,298
What happened?

00:18:50,298 --> 00:18:54,302
Well, we're investigating
it as a homicide.

00:18:54,302 --> 00:18:56,571
(gasps)
Oh, my...

00:18:56,571 --> 00:18:58,807
Do you know if he
had any enemies?

00:18:58,807 --> 00:19:01,610
Anyone threaten him
or your business?

00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:03,178
No.

00:19:03,178 --> 00:19:05,881
Dan was a prince.

00:19:05,881 --> 00:19:08,350
Everybody loved him.

00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:12,320
Genealogy was his life.

00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,855
If he had any faults,

00:19:13,855 --> 00:19:17,192
it was that he got too
close to his clients.

00:19:17,192 --> 00:19:19,494
What about his
personal life?

00:19:19,494 --> 00:19:22,330
No, he wasn't seeing anyone.

00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:26,168
Did he usually
carry a briefcase?

00:19:26,168 --> 00:19:28,937
Yes. It was
his second office.

00:19:28,937 --> 00:19:31,606
What was in it?

00:19:31,606 --> 00:19:33,642
Um, his work,
his research.

00:19:33,642 --> 00:19:35,644
Did he have a client list?

00:19:35,644 --> 00:19:37,179
Um...

00:19:39,781 --> 00:19:41,850
Client names, phone numbers.

00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:43,385
Oh, great, thanks.

00:19:43,385 --> 00:19:45,287
Mrs. Hoppe,

00:19:45,287 --> 00:19:47,656
was it normal
for your partner

00:19:47,656 --> 00:19:49,391
to meet with his
clients at night?

00:19:49,391 --> 00:19:52,260
Yes, we try to accommodate
their schedules.

00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,930
If they're working, then
we visit them after work.

00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:56,932
There's a Judy Robbins

00:19:56,932 --> 00:19:58,533
on this list.

00:19:58,533 --> 00:20:00,168
Do you know her?

00:20:00,168 --> 00:20:03,738
No, I think he
finished that project.

00:20:06,508 --> 00:20:08,643
I'm sorry.

00:20:08,643 --> 00:20:10,579
Will you excuse me, please?

00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:24,326
Thank you for not
asking how I'm doing.

00:20:24,326 --> 00:20:27,162
David's been asking me
every five minutes.

00:20:27,162 --> 00:20:28,697
Well, he's concerned.

00:20:28,697 --> 00:20:30,665
As we all are.

00:20:30,665 --> 00:20:32,901
I know what you're thinking.

00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:37,506
Well, uh...

00:20:37,506 --> 00:20:39,541
it's just hard enough

00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:41,543
when someone you
love's in trouble.

00:20:41,543 --> 00:20:44,813
It's harder still when
you're dealing with betrayal.

00:20:44,813 --> 00:20:47,449
You don't think about that
when you have an affair.

00:20:47,449 --> 00:20:49,818
Judy had an affair before?

00:20:49,818 --> 00:20:51,219
Not her. Me.

00:20:52,854 --> 00:20:56,858
Everyone assumes
that I can't...

00:20:56,858 --> 00:20:59,494
a-and I wanted to
see if I could.

00:21:01,329 --> 00:21:03,732
Almost destroyed Judy
and our marriage.

00:21:03,732 --> 00:21:05,867
When I was married to Eddie,

00:21:05,867 --> 00:21:06,935
he would hurt me,

00:21:06,935 --> 00:21:08,470
and then...

00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:10,872
I would hurt him back,
and it was just...

00:21:10,872 --> 00:21:12,440
years of back and forth.

00:21:14,576 --> 00:21:16,545
That what you think
happened here?

00:21:16,545 --> 00:21:17,913
(phone ringing)

00:21:17,913 --> 00:21:19,481
Cath, I have to take this,
I'm sorry.

00:21:19,481 --> 00:21:22,183
Yeah. Oh, of course.

00:21:22,183 --> 00:21:26,721
Yeah, thanks for getting back
to me so quickly.

00:21:26,721 --> 00:21:28,723
I got your name
from a colleague.

00:21:28,723 --> 00:21:33,461
My wife needs a criminal
defense attorney.

00:21:33,461 --> 00:21:35,397
It's a murder.

00:21:44,205 --> 00:21:46,241
Hey, Russell wants an update.

00:21:46,241 --> 00:21:48,410
You know, for a guy
who seems so laid back,

00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:49,911
Russell can be terrifying.

00:21:49,911 --> 00:21:51,646
Terrifying? No.

00:21:51,646 --> 00:21:53,715
I mean, maybe a bit
odd or demanding.

00:21:53,715 --> 00:21:55,917
But, hey, as long as
you get the job done

00:21:55,917 --> 00:21:57,552
as fast as humanly
possible--

00:21:57,552 --> 00:21:58,920
Does he ever yell
out your name?

00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:02,757
I like to think of it
as a respectful shout.

00:22:02,757 --> 00:22:04,359
Hm.
DNA results?

00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:05,860
There.
Help yourself.

00:22:08,597 --> 00:22:09,898
All right,

00:22:09,898 --> 00:22:11,900
semen stains on the bed sheets

00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,501
are an admixture of DNA
from Doc and Judy.

00:22:13,501 --> 00:22:15,870
I didn't find semen
from Traxler anywhere,

00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:17,138
but I found his saliva.

00:22:19,641 --> 00:22:21,343
On a pillow?
Likely the murder weapon.

00:22:21,343 --> 00:22:22,711
Found touch DNA, too.

00:22:22,711 --> 00:22:26,348
SANDERS: <i>So the killer</i>
<i>didn't wear gloves.</i>

00:22:26,348 --> 00:22:28,516
And the DNA's male,
and... not Doc Robbins'.

00:22:28,516 --> 00:22:31,186
I'm running it through
CODIS right now.

00:22:31,186 --> 00:22:33,855
And our guy's not in CODIS.

00:22:33,855 --> 00:22:36,257
I'll give you anything
if you tell Russell.

00:22:38,326 --> 00:22:40,395
So, the DNA's
a dead end?

00:22:40,395 --> 00:22:42,797
Um... well, not necessarily.

00:22:42,797 --> 00:22:44,799
We could expand our search

00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,668
from an individual
to a family.

00:22:46,668 --> 00:22:49,270
If it gets
a hit in CODIS,

00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:51,139
that family could
lead us to the killer,

00:22:51,139 --> 00:22:53,508
like a DNA family tree.

00:22:53,508 --> 00:22:56,378
<i>If the killer</i>
<i>has family in CODIS,</i>

00:22:56,378 --> 00:22:57,846
<i>we'll get a partial match.</i>

00:23:01,449 --> 00:23:03,184
Just--just one problem.

00:23:03,184 --> 00:23:06,287
Uh, can't exactly push
a button to do this search.

00:23:06,287 --> 00:23:08,423
You need
the sheriff's approval.

00:23:08,423 --> 00:23:09,891
Okay, I will...

00:23:09,891 --> 00:23:12,327
mention that when
I talk to the sheriff.

00:23:13,495 --> 00:23:15,797
Was there something else?

00:23:15,797 --> 00:23:17,165
No.

00:23:17,165 --> 00:23:18,500
Okay.

00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,568
I can't believe somebody
hurt that nice man.

00:23:20,568 --> 00:23:24,806
Ms. Smith, you were on Dan
Traxler's client list.

00:23:24,806 --> 00:23:26,408
You hired him?
Yes.

00:23:26,408 --> 00:23:28,810
See, I'm getting married.

00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:31,279
And my dad's dead;
his folks, too.

00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:33,715
My mom's not close to
our family, but I thought

00:23:33,715 --> 00:23:35,417
if I found her father--
my grandfather--

00:23:35,417 --> 00:23:37,318
maybe he could walk me
down the aisle.

00:23:37,318 --> 00:23:39,888
So you wanted Mr. Traxler
to find him?
Yeah. He said

00:23:39,888 --> 00:23:42,290
if my grandfather was alive,
he could track him down.

00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:44,325
Did he?
I don't know.

00:23:44,325 --> 00:23:46,594
We were supposed
to meet again today.

00:23:46,594 --> 00:23:49,731
He was excited
to show me new documents
and records he found.

00:23:49,731 --> 00:23:51,866
He was like a paper detective.

00:23:51,866 --> 00:23:53,868
Mr. Traxler ever...

00:23:53,868 --> 00:23:55,737
behave inappropriately

00:23:55,737 --> 00:23:57,706
towards you?
(laughs):
God, no.

00:23:57,706 --> 00:23:59,507
The guy was a monk.

00:23:59,507 --> 00:24:01,242
He lived in the past.

00:24:01,242 --> 00:24:03,511
"Feasted on history."
His words.

00:24:03,511 --> 00:24:05,780
Ask his other clients--
they'll tell you the same thing.

00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,682
I spoke with a couple
of them before I hired him.

00:24:07,682 --> 00:24:09,517
Oh, did you speak
to Judy Robbins?

00:24:09,517 --> 00:24:12,287
Yeah. She couldn't say
enough nice things about him.

00:24:14,422 --> 00:24:17,659
I was really counting on having
my grandfather at my wedding.

00:24:17,659 --> 00:24:20,662
What is your
grandfather's name?

00:24:20,662 --> 00:24:23,698
Samuel Francis Duggan.

00:24:23,698 --> 00:24:25,900
Isn't that a nice name?

00:24:28,169 --> 00:24:31,873
♪ And here's to you,
Mrs. Ro-hah-bins... ♪

00:24:31,873 --> 00:24:33,742
That's not funny, and I'm busy.

00:24:33,742 --> 00:24:37,178
So if you have any results
for me, cough 'em up.

00:24:37,178 --> 00:24:39,380
(clears throat)

00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:42,617
Lipstick on the victim's face
was a match to Judy's brand.

00:24:42,617 --> 00:24:44,385
Well, she said
she gave him CPR.

00:24:44,385 --> 00:24:46,454
I'll bet that's not
all she gave him.

00:24:46,454 --> 00:24:47,622
I'm just saying

00:24:47,622 --> 00:24:49,557
that when I play
"Sexual Healing,"

00:24:49,557 --> 00:24:51,392
it's foreplay.

00:24:51,392 --> 00:24:53,495
Yeah, well, playing it
for yourself doesn't count.

00:24:53,495 --> 00:24:55,230
(wry laugh)
What about
the cat litter?

00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:57,198
Not a match
to the Robbins' cat.

00:24:57,198 --> 00:24:58,800
It contained urine
with alprazolam.

00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,469
Why would a cat need
antidepressants?

00:25:01,469 --> 00:25:04,339
Antidepressants are commonly
prescribed for felines

00:25:04,339 --> 00:25:06,241
undergoing prolonged
medical treatment.

00:25:06,241 --> 00:25:08,777
And... check this out.

00:25:08,777 --> 00:25:11,346
One sweep of my radiation
isotope identifier...

00:25:11,346 --> 00:25:12,647
(beeping)

00:25:12,647 --> 00:25:16,518
Rings like a Super Jackpot.

00:25:16,518 --> 00:25:17,852
So the cat urine

00:25:17,852 --> 00:25:20,622
is radioactive?
Iodine 131.

00:25:20,622 --> 00:25:24,292
It's used to treat
thyroid cancer, and it has

00:25:24,292 --> 00:25:26,661
a half-life of eight days.
Now, I'm thinking

00:25:26,661 --> 00:25:29,764
that the sick cat belonged
to the illicit lover.
No.

00:25:29,764 --> 00:25:32,634
No way. I checked Traxler's
shoes, office, house--

00:25:32,634 --> 00:25:34,936
no kitty litter
and no kitty.

00:25:34,936 --> 00:25:37,539
There's always the
"unknown accomplice" theory.

00:25:37,539 --> 00:25:39,240
Or Judy's telling the truth

00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,242
and someone else
was in that house.

00:25:41,242 --> 00:25:43,244
Either way, you're looking
for a sick cat.

00:25:43,244 --> 00:25:46,614
Chemotherapy's expensive, done
only by veterinary specialists.

00:25:46,614 --> 00:25:49,250
Okay, so then get me a
list of those specialists

00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:51,820
and every cat they've treated
in the last eight days.

00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,188
Get me a warrant.

00:25:53,188 --> 00:25:54,556
There's a pet-vet privilege.

00:25:54,556 --> 00:25:56,291
Seriously?
No can get you

00:25:56,291 --> 00:25:59,160
a list of furless
felines without it.

00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,862
(groans)

00:26:02,197 --> 00:26:03,531
RUSSELL:
<i>Henry,</i>

00:26:03,531 --> 00:26:05,834
what do you got?
Ah, the CODIS
familial search

00:26:05,834 --> 00:26:07,602
found our killer's
first order relative.

00:26:07,602 --> 00:26:10,305
A Jimmy Duggan.
"First order"

00:26:10,305 --> 00:26:12,473
meaning father, brother,
son of our killer, right?

00:26:12,473 --> 00:26:13,908
Here's what I've got.

00:26:13,908 --> 00:26:15,810
Traxler's client,
Carla Duggan Smith,

00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:17,545
was looking for
her grandfather--

00:26:17,545 --> 00:26:20,148
Samuel Francis Duggan.

00:26:20,148 --> 00:26:23,518
Maybe Traxler found Sam,
and then Sam found Traxler?

00:26:23,518 --> 00:26:24,786
So now we need to find Sam.

00:26:24,786 --> 00:26:26,254
Hey, maybe Jimmy knows
where he is.

00:26:26,254 --> 00:26:27,555
I actually did
some extra credit.

00:26:27,555 --> 00:26:29,324
I could tell you
where Jimmy is.

00:26:29,324 --> 00:26:31,459
Same place he's been
the last 13 years.

00:26:31,459 --> 00:26:33,828
That's almost too easy.

00:26:39,901 --> 00:26:42,270
Whatever you want,
I didn't do it.

00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:43,571
(chuckles)

00:26:43,571 --> 00:26:45,907
It says here that
you're serving

00:26:45,907 --> 00:26:48,543
a life sentence
for armed robbery

00:26:48,543 --> 00:26:51,579
That third strike,
that--that's a bitch.

00:26:51,579 --> 00:26:53,481
I'll bet.

00:26:53,481 --> 00:26:56,651
I want to ask some questions
about your family, specifically

00:26:56,651 --> 00:26:58,853
Samuel Duggan.

00:26:58,853 --> 00:27:02,257
My old man left when I was 13.

00:27:02,257 --> 00:27:05,360
He divorced my crazy
bitch of a mother.

00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,295
I mean, she was always
high on something.

00:27:07,295 --> 00:27:08,496
Used to beat the crap out of me.

00:27:08,496 --> 00:27:10,298
That must've been rough.
Yeah, well,

00:27:10,298 --> 00:27:12,300
you won't see me crying.

00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,868
When the old man left,

00:27:13,868 --> 00:27:15,737
I did, too, you know?

00:27:15,737 --> 00:27:17,906
On my own at 13.

00:27:17,906 --> 00:27:20,375
No wonder I ended up
in the big house, right?

00:27:21,809 --> 00:27:23,745
Do you have any
brothers, Jimmy?

00:27:23,745 --> 00:27:25,246
No.

00:27:25,246 --> 00:27:27,181
I got one sister--Jasmine.

00:27:27,181 --> 00:27:29,350
She likes to pretend I'm dead.

00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:32,754
And, of course, the old man, he
could have more, I don't know.

00:27:32,754 --> 00:27:35,890
No, I'm looking for full
male relatives, no steps.

00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:38,426
You have any sons?
Nope.

00:27:38,426 --> 00:27:40,628
What did that bastard do?

00:27:40,628 --> 00:27:42,463
Maybe nothing, maybe murder.

00:27:42,463 --> 00:27:43,598
Well, hot damn!

00:27:43,598 --> 00:27:45,667
We'd be cell mates.

00:27:45,667 --> 00:27:47,435
(both chuckling)

00:27:47,435 --> 00:27:50,605
Hey, do you think your mom
might know where Sam is?

00:27:50,605 --> 00:27:52,307
Nah, doubt that.

00:27:52,307 --> 00:27:54,375
If she's sober,
you can ask her yourself.

00:27:54,375 --> 00:27:55,777
She lives in Primm.

00:28:02,717 --> 00:28:04,619
I searched all
our databases--

00:28:04,619 --> 00:28:07,388
all I got was Samuel
Duggan's date of birth.

00:28:07,388 --> 00:28:11,859
Oh, archival databases are
notoriously incomplete.

00:28:11,859 --> 00:28:14,595
He could live in another state;
he could be dead.

00:28:14,595 --> 00:28:16,497
But Dan would have
discovered that weeks ago

00:28:16,497 --> 00:28:17,765
and informed his client.

00:28:17,765 --> 00:28:19,467
So...

00:28:19,467 --> 00:28:21,836
let's find Jimmy's
father Sam by doing

00:28:21,836 --> 00:28:24,272
the Smith-Duggan
family tree.

00:28:24,272 --> 00:28:27,442
Okay, tell me
what you know.

00:28:27,442 --> 00:28:31,279
All right, uh, my boss
talked with Jimmy Duggan.

00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,314
His dad, Sam,

00:28:33,314 --> 00:28:35,416
married Eunice Carter

00:28:35,416 --> 00:28:37,819
in 1956 or '57,

00:28:37,819 --> 00:28:39,821
right out
of high school.
Mm-hmm.

00:28:39,821 --> 00:28:42,256
They had Jimmy in 1958

00:28:42,256 --> 00:28:44,425
and his sister Jasmine

00:28:44,425 --> 00:28:45,727
in '67.

00:28:45,727 --> 00:28:47,762
Now, Jasmine
Duggan married

00:28:47,762 --> 00:28:49,864
Gary Smith in '88,

00:28:49,864 --> 00:28:51,866
and they had Carla

00:28:51,866 --> 00:28:53,568
in 1990.

00:28:53,568 --> 00:28:56,270
Oh, she's the client
who wanted to be

00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:58,306
walked down the aisle
by a male relative, right?

00:28:58,306 --> 00:29:00,241
Right. According to Jimmy,

00:29:00,241 --> 00:29:02,243
there are no other
male relatives.

00:29:02,243 --> 00:29:04,545
(sighs):
Okay, Hojem-Sanders...

00:29:04,545 --> 00:29:08,182
the last document signed
by Samuel Duggan

00:29:08,182 --> 00:29:10,885
was the divorce decree--
as far as we know--

00:29:10,885 --> 00:29:12,687
in 1971.

00:29:12,687 --> 00:29:14,689
All we have to
do is find it.

00:29:14,689 --> 00:29:15,623
(pats Sanders' thigh)

00:29:17,625 --> 00:29:19,527
BRAD LEWIS: She's done
answering questions.

00:29:19,527 --> 00:29:20,862
Judy, let's go.

00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:24,465
(sobbing sighs)

00:29:24,465 --> 00:29:25,900
Oh... Al.

00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:30,772
(crying)

00:29:33,441 --> 00:29:36,577
I just want to go home.

00:29:36,577 --> 00:29:39,280
Listen, Mr. Lewis

00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,315
will drive you home.

00:29:41,315 --> 00:29:43,684
Al... we need to talk.

00:29:43,684 --> 00:29:45,686
I want to explain everything.

00:29:45,686 --> 00:29:47,522
It's just...
Judy, Judy...

00:29:47,522 --> 00:29:50,224
I need to believe in you--

00:29:50,224 --> 00:29:51,559
in us--

00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:54,195
and if we talk

00:29:54,195 --> 00:29:56,297
and I'm not convinced...

00:29:56,297 --> 00:29:59,634
it'll all be gone, and
I'm not prepared for that.

00:30:03,838 --> 00:30:05,773
(whispers):
Okay.

00:30:08,176 --> 00:30:11,212
Well, when you're
ready to talk...

00:30:11,212 --> 00:30:13,181
I'll be at home.

00:30:26,561 --> 00:30:29,564
Sit down, Hojem-Sanders.

00:30:29,564 --> 00:30:32,467
Have I got a story for you.

00:30:35,803 --> 00:30:38,739
Sam and Eunice's
divorce decree.

00:30:38,739 --> 00:30:40,575
And here's the
interesting part.

00:30:40,575 --> 00:30:44,378
In the state of Nevada,
a divorce is normally given

00:30:44,378 --> 00:30:46,747
six months after
the filing.

00:30:46,747 --> 00:30:48,683
Check the dates.

00:30:48,683 --> 00:30:50,184
Well, this one took
nine months.

00:30:50,184 --> 00:30:51,252
Why is that?

00:30:51,252 --> 00:30:53,488
Eunice was pregnant.

00:30:53,488 --> 00:30:54,689
Judges won't grant

00:30:54,689 --> 00:30:56,657
a divorce if the
woman is with child.

00:30:56,657 --> 00:30:58,559
They want to wait
till after the birth

00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,495
to resolve any
custody issues.

00:31:00,495 --> 00:31:02,196
So Jimmy Duggan
could have a sibling

00:31:02,196 --> 00:31:03,664
that he doesn't even know about.

00:31:03,664 --> 00:31:05,766
Oh, it gets better--
there is

00:31:05,766 --> 00:31:08,503
no mention of a baby
in this decree.

00:31:08,503 --> 00:31:11,906
And there's no record of a
birth certificate in 1971

00:31:11,906 --> 00:31:13,374
for a Duggan.

00:31:13,374 --> 00:31:15,343
And I even checked

00:31:15,343 --> 00:31:17,378
under Eunice's
maiden name Carter.

00:31:17,378 --> 00:31:18,679
Nothing.

00:31:18,679 --> 00:31:20,248
So where does that leave us?

00:31:24,452 --> 00:31:27,421
"A baby was left on the steps of
Desert Palm Hospital yesterday.

00:31:27,421 --> 00:31:29,457
"In honor of St. Patrick's Day,

00:31:29,457 --> 00:31:32,226
"the nurses named him
Baby Patrick.

00:31:32,226 --> 00:31:34,262
"He will be sent
to St. Martine's Orphanage

00:31:34,262 --> 00:31:36,397
later this week."

00:31:36,397 --> 00:31:38,432
March 17, 1971.

00:31:39,934 --> 00:31:41,669
Date fits.

00:31:41,669 --> 00:31:43,771
It's not very scientific.

00:31:43,771 --> 00:31:46,274
Well, this isn't science,
this is genealogy.

00:31:46,274 --> 00:31:47,575
Trust your gut.

00:31:47,575 --> 00:31:49,544
SANDERS:
Well, my gut says:

00:31:49,544 --> 00:31:52,246
How do we find
St. Patrick?

00:31:52,246 --> 00:31:54,415
Have faith, my son.

00:31:54,415 --> 00:31:56,851
Have faith.

00:32:02,623 --> 00:32:04,792
SANDERS: I'm really digging
this genealogy stuff.

00:32:04,792 --> 00:32:07,261
When Denmark ceded Norway
to Sweden, back in 1814,

00:32:07,261 --> 00:32:09,630
with the Treaty of Kiel,
my great-great grandfather,

00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:13,467
Olaf Hojem, was one of
the leaders of the uprising
against Swedish rule.

00:32:13,467 --> 00:32:15,603
He helped convene the
first Norwegian assembly

00:32:15,603 --> 00:32:17,471
and write the
national constitution.

00:32:17,471 --> 00:32:19,840
That sounds great, but
tell me about Baby Patrick.

00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,210
Well, St. Martine's
Orphanage is long-gone,

00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:25,346
but Donna was able to
track down one of the nuns.

00:32:25,346 --> 00:32:27,281
According to
Sister Mary Agnes,

00:32:27,281 --> 00:32:28,849
Patrick's legal name
is Patrick O'Toole,

00:32:28,849 --> 00:32:30,751
which was the nun's
family name.

00:32:30,751 --> 00:32:33,354
Apparently, there's a lot of
O'Tooles running around Vegas.

00:32:33,354 --> 00:32:35,323
What do we know about
Patrick O'Toole?

00:32:35,323 --> 00:32:36,857
Uh, he's still local.

00:32:36,857 --> 00:32:39,393
I checked out his work--
Hodges is at his apartment now.

00:32:39,393 --> 00:32:40,661
Hey.

00:32:40,661 --> 00:32:42,863
Wait until I tell you
about Eunice Duggan.

00:32:42,863 --> 00:32:45,266
I always try
to remain impartial,

00:32:45,266 --> 00:32:46,734
but a woman like
Eunice Duggan

00:32:46,734 --> 00:32:48,836
should not be
allowed to procreate.

00:32:48,836 --> 00:32:51,639
That woman didn't stop
yelling at me the entire
time I was at her house.

00:32:51,639 --> 00:32:53,407
So Eunice was
ex-wife of Samuel

00:32:53,407 --> 00:32:55,409
and mother of Jimmy.

00:32:55,409 --> 00:32:56,744
And possibly

00:32:56,744 --> 00:32:58,679
the birth mother
of Patrick O'Toole,

00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:01,182
who dumped him
at Desert Palm Hospital.

00:33:01,182 --> 00:33:03,484
Eunice gave up DNA, but denies
having a kid in 1971.

00:33:03,484 --> 00:33:06,187
Anyway, Henry's running her swab
against the other samples.

00:33:06,187 --> 00:33:07,321
HODGES:
Okay, so,

00:33:07,321 --> 00:33:08,923
uh, the landlord
would not let me

00:33:08,923 --> 00:33:11,259
into Patrick O'Toole's
apartment, but he did give me

00:33:11,259 --> 00:33:12,893
one very interesting piece
of information.

00:33:12,893 --> 00:33:14,362
O'Toole has a cat.

00:33:14,362 --> 00:33:15,763
A sick cat.

00:33:15,763 --> 00:33:17,665
And there's only
one vet in Vegas

00:33:17,665 --> 00:33:19,467
that does cat
thyroid chemo.

00:33:19,467 --> 00:33:21,168
(cat mewing)

00:33:21,168 --> 00:33:22,637
What--What about my cat?

00:33:22,637 --> 00:33:24,305
You pretended
to be my vet,

00:33:24,305 --> 00:33:26,407
you told me Barclay
needs emergency surgery?

00:33:26,407 --> 00:33:27,775
That's entrapment
or something.

00:33:27,775 --> 00:33:29,777
If I were you,
I'd be more worried

00:33:29,777 --> 00:33:32,246
about the DNA sample
we just sent to the lab.

00:33:32,246 --> 00:33:34,515
Barclay needs his meds.
Well, the vet is
right outside.

00:33:34,515 --> 00:33:36,617
He's gonna make sure
Barclay gets what he needs.

00:33:36,617 --> 00:33:38,319
All right?
Now that we got

00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:40,221
the cat out of the way,
let's talk about murder.

00:33:40,221 --> 00:33:41,522
You ever hear
of Dan Traxler?

00:33:41,522 --> 00:33:43,324
Nope.

00:33:43,324 --> 00:33:45,793
Let me see the bottom
of your shoes.

00:33:45,793 --> 00:33:47,461
What, you need help?

00:33:49,363 --> 00:33:51,365
Looks like someone
stepped in it.

00:33:52,667 --> 00:33:54,235
(electronic crackling,
blipping)

00:33:54,235 --> 00:33:56,237
Radioactive cat litter.

00:33:56,237 --> 00:33:59,640
So, you were in
Judy Robbins's house.

00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,242
Who the hell's she?

00:34:01,242 --> 00:34:03,311
Dan Traxler was visiting her
when you killed him.

00:34:03,311 --> 00:34:05,913
Look, the evidence
is going to tell us.

00:34:05,913 --> 00:34:07,848
I just want to hear it from you.

00:34:10,885 --> 00:34:12,553
What the hell's
wrong with you?

00:34:12,553 --> 00:34:14,488
I think I screwed up
the DNA.

00:34:14,488 --> 00:34:15,923
Well, if you screw up the DNA,

00:34:15,923 --> 00:34:17,725
you can kiss your
career good-bye.

00:34:17,725 --> 00:34:20,695
I know! Just... look.

00:34:20,695 --> 00:34:22,730
Well, the sample
runs look fine.

00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:24,899
Look at the references.

00:34:27,535 --> 00:34:28,736
Oh.

00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:31,272
(sighs)
I'm not so sure

00:34:31,272 --> 00:34:33,407
you did anything wrong,

00:34:33,407 --> 00:34:35,843
but somebody might've.

00:34:35,843 --> 00:34:39,213
We have to do a kin test to try
and make some sense out of this.

00:34:39,213 --> 00:34:41,749
Well, I'm not gonna
do this by myself.

00:34:41,749 --> 00:34:44,218
Get the reagent.

00:34:51,459 --> 00:34:54,395
♪ ♪

00:35:11,779 --> 00:35:14,348
Not a lot of diversity, so,

00:35:14,348 --> 00:35:16,851
Eunice, Jimmy and
Patrick are related.

00:35:16,851 --> 00:35:19,687
Just not how we
thought they were.

00:35:19,687 --> 00:35:21,422
We need to confirm this
with Y-STR.

00:35:21,422 --> 00:35:22,723
Y-chromosome-linked DNA.

00:35:22,723 --> 00:35:25,659
That's the only
way to be certain.

00:35:30,831 --> 00:35:32,299
Missing briefcase?
Yup.

00:35:32,299 --> 00:35:34,201
Recovered it
from Patrick's car.

00:35:34,201 --> 00:35:36,871
All right, great. So that proves
that he was in Doc's house.

00:35:36,871 --> 00:35:38,539
What was in it?

00:35:38,539 --> 00:35:40,574
Documents from a bunch
of clients, including

00:35:40,574 --> 00:35:42,610
Carla Duggan Smith.

00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:44,345
Traxler kept
very detailed records

00:35:44,345 --> 00:35:47,348
of everything--every
meeting, every phone call.

00:35:47,348 --> 00:35:49,884
And according to his log,
he did meet with Patrick

00:35:49,884 --> 00:35:52,253
several times, including
the day he was murdered.

00:35:52,253 --> 00:35:54,555
Maybe Traxler stumbled
across Patrick

00:35:54,555 --> 00:35:56,590
when he was looking for
Carla's grandfather.

00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:58,759
You know, maybe he thought
he'd found another relative

00:35:58,759 --> 00:36:00,294
for Carla to invite
to her wedding.

00:36:00,294 --> 00:36:02,329
I'm still not sure
how this leads to murder.

00:36:02,329 --> 00:36:03,497
Yeah, me, neither.

00:36:03,497 --> 00:36:04,765
Greg's working that angle.

00:36:04,765 --> 00:36:06,734
Oh, good. Greg!

00:36:06,734 --> 00:36:08,836
Good job.

00:36:10,371 --> 00:36:12,306
You know we have
an intercom system.

00:36:12,306 --> 00:36:13,607
I got our motive.

00:36:13,607 --> 00:36:15,910
I know why Patrick
killed Traxler.

00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:17,545
And it's twisted.

00:36:17,545 --> 00:36:18,913
Cue the banjo music.

00:36:18,913 --> 00:36:22,416
This report says
that your DNA was found

00:36:22,416 --> 00:36:26,253
on the pillow used to
smother Dan Traxler.

00:36:26,253 --> 00:36:28,689
Without saying one word,
that's 25 to life.

00:36:28,689 --> 00:36:31,725
It also says that the Duggans

00:36:31,725 --> 00:36:34,261
have one hell
of a family secret.

00:36:34,261 --> 00:36:36,697
Screw you.

00:36:36,697 --> 00:36:40,768
You were orphaned, abandoned,
on your own since you were born.

00:36:40,768 --> 00:36:42,403
Must have developed
a thick skin.

00:36:42,403 --> 00:36:46,407
Probably tried to forget
you even had a family.

00:36:46,407 --> 00:36:48,509
Hard to miss
what you've never had.

00:36:48,509 --> 00:36:52,379
Until that genealogist
showed up asking questions

00:36:52,379 --> 00:36:55,282
about your family,
especially your father.

00:36:55,282 --> 00:36:57,318
And your curiosity
got the best of you.

00:36:57,318 --> 00:36:58,686
BRASS:
So you followed him,

00:36:58,686 --> 00:37:01,789
and I'm betting
that the old lady,

00:37:01,789 --> 00:37:04,458
Mama Eunice, wasn't
too happy to see you.

00:37:04,458 --> 00:37:06,794
<i>And she told you</i>
<i>who your father was.</i>

00:37:06,794 --> 00:37:09,497
You are the devil's spawn.

00:37:09,497 --> 00:37:11,565
I didn't want you then,

00:37:11,565 --> 00:37:14,635
and I sure as hell
don't want you now.

00:37:17,371 --> 00:37:19,473
My mother had sex
with her own son.

00:37:19,473 --> 00:37:21,809
BRASS:
When Jimmy was 13.

00:37:21,809 --> 00:37:23,811
Now, that's rape in 50 states,

00:37:23,811 --> 00:37:26,580
without a statute
of limitations.

00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:28,516
She's going down,

00:37:28,516 --> 00:37:31,318
and you're the walking,
talking proof of her crime.

00:37:31,318 --> 00:37:32,820
Why take your anger out
on Traxler?

00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:35,489
This guy shows up
all excited,

00:37:35,489 --> 00:37:37,691
talking about family reunions
and happy endings.

00:37:37,691 --> 00:37:39,793
And for the first
time in your life,

00:37:39,793 --> 00:37:42,162
you thought,
you're not alone.
Yeah.

00:37:42,162 --> 00:37:45,399
And thanks to him, I know just
how screwed up my family is.

00:37:45,399 --> 00:37:47,334
What were you doing
at Judy Robbins's house?

00:37:47,334 --> 00:37:49,870
After I left that
crazy bitch,

00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:52,640
I went to Traxler's office
to get in his face.

00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,242
Saw him leave,
so I followed him.

00:37:57,845 --> 00:38:01,448
Patrick.
Get up. Now!

00:38:01,448 --> 00:38:03,384
Come with me.
And the briefcase.

00:38:04,685 --> 00:38:06,253
You banging this broad?

00:38:06,253 --> 00:38:07,321
Absolutely not.

00:38:07,321 --> 00:38:08,722
She's just a client.

00:38:08,722 --> 00:38:09,890
Take your clothes off.

00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:11,559
Do it, or I'll kill her.

00:38:13,694 --> 00:38:15,362
Now get in the bed.

00:38:15,362 --> 00:38:16,597
Okay, okay...

00:38:16,597 --> 00:38:18,465
(muffled screaming)

00:38:18,465 --> 00:38:21,569
PATRICK: <i>Everybody screws</i>
<i>everybody in this world.</i>

00:38:21,569 --> 00:38:24,338
<i>I knew you cops would think</i>
<i>it was a sex thing.</i>

00:38:24,338 --> 00:38:27,608
My mother's a drunken whore,

00:38:27,608 --> 00:38:30,210
and my brother's my father.

00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:32,613
I didn't need
to know that.

00:38:32,613 --> 00:38:34,848
He ruined my life.

00:38:34,848 --> 00:38:37,351
SANDERS:
Well, for what it's worth,

00:38:37,351 --> 00:38:40,421
I don't think
Traxler knew about the incest.

00:38:40,421 --> 00:38:42,690
I don't care!
Rodriguez,
wrap him up.

00:38:43,757 --> 00:38:44,892
That's it?

00:39:01,508 --> 00:39:04,411
He should've just
left it alone.

00:39:14,521 --> 00:39:16,657
SANDERS:
Donna.

00:39:16,657 --> 00:39:17,925
What brings you here?

00:39:17,925 --> 00:39:19,860
I found Grandpa
Sam in Provo.

00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,662
He goes by Grafs now.

00:39:21,662 --> 00:39:23,831
And he's agreed to meet Carla.

00:39:23,831 --> 00:39:25,666
Oh. Well, after all that,

00:39:25,666 --> 00:39:27,735
I hope
he walks her down the aisle.

00:39:27,735 --> 00:39:31,505
Hojem-Sanders,
you are a true romantic.

00:39:31,505 --> 00:39:33,874
It's very appealing.

00:39:36,477 --> 00:39:38,846
We arrested the man
who killed Dan.

00:39:38,846 --> 00:39:40,414
I heard.

00:39:40,414 --> 00:39:41,849
Thank you for that.

00:39:41,849 --> 00:39:44,318
It's easy to get too
close to a client.

00:39:44,318 --> 00:39:47,254
But Dan always had their
interests at heart.

00:39:49,223 --> 00:39:51,158
(sighs)

00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:55,462
In the 1900s,

00:39:55,462 --> 00:39:58,632
Alrik Magnar Hojem

00:39:58,632 --> 00:40:02,569
was one of the richest
men in Edina, Minnesota.

00:40:02,569 --> 00:40:04,538
And legend has it,

00:40:04,538 --> 00:40:09,343
that because of his vast wealth
and enormous ego,

00:40:09,343 --> 00:40:12,546
he earned the
nickname "cake-eaters,"

00:40:12,546 --> 00:40:16,150
a derogatory term used to
describe all Edina residents

00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:18,585
by their less
affluent neighbors.

00:40:18,585 --> 00:40:20,554
Alrik was my great uncle.

00:40:20,554 --> 00:40:22,723
His ego was legendary.

00:40:22,723 --> 00:40:25,392
In fact, that's how my family
ended up in California.

00:40:25,392 --> 00:40:27,594
Ah.

00:40:27,594 --> 00:40:30,330
If I wanted to learn more
about my family history,

00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:31,765
is it okay to call you?

00:40:31,765 --> 00:40:33,367
Of course.

00:40:33,367 --> 00:40:35,669
But let's concentrate
on the Hojems.

00:40:35,669 --> 00:40:38,172
And remember, hyphenate.

00:40:47,848 --> 00:40:49,616
Hey.

00:40:49,616 --> 00:40:51,485
I'm glad I caught you.

00:40:51,485 --> 00:40:54,788
Al, everything
Judy said checked out.

00:40:54,788 --> 00:40:58,525
I just couldn't get past
that first impression.

00:40:58,525 --> 00:41:00,494
Hard for me to
get past it, too.

00:41:00,494 --> 00:41:01,862
Yeah, I guess

00:41:01,862 --> 00:41:04,698
I was punishing her for
what my ex-wife did to me,

00:41:04,698 --> 00:41:06,934
but that was my marriage,
not yours.

00:41:06,934 --> 00:41:08,936
You were right.

00:41:08,936 --> 00:41:11,805
My past clouded my judgment.

00:41:13,307 --> 00:41:14,641
I'm sorry.

00:41:14,641 --> 00:41:16,910
I appreciate that, Jim.

00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:18,612
Yeah...

00:41:18,612 --> 00:41:20,547
Oh, uh... oh,
this is... (laughs)

00:41:20,547 --> 00:41:22,549
This was in
Traxler's briefcase.

00:41:22,549 --> 00:41:24,418
It has your name on it.

00:41:24,418 --> 00:41:26,153
I'll let Judy tell you
what's inside.

00:41:27,755 --> 00:41:29,690
Go home to your wife, buddy.

00:41:37,698 --> 00:41:40,634
♪ ♪

00:41:51,411 --> 00:41:52,513
Hi.

00:41:53,614 --> 00:41:56,450
Hi. (laughs)

00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:58,385
I was beginning to think

00:41:58,385 --> 00:42:01,221
you were going to
sleep at the office.

00:42:01,221 --> 00:42:04,258
I'm sorry for doubting you.

00:42:06,794 --> 00:42:09,363
And... I'm sorry for...

00:42:09,363 --> 00:42:11,331
for keeping secrets. I...

00:42:13,367 --> 00:42:15,302
I wanted it to be a surprise.

00:42:18,238 --> 00:42:20,240
You did that.

00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,543
Al, I love you.

00:42:25,546 --> 00:42:26,914
Don't ever doubt that.

00:42:26,914 --> 00:42:28,849
I won't.

00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:32,820
(sighs)

00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:34,254
(sighs)

00:42:34,254 --> 00:42:35,756
Mm!

00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,729
All right, go ahead,
open it.

00:42:45,165 --> 00:42:46,934
Whoa!

00:42:46,934 --> 00:42:48,268
Yeah.

00:42:48,268 --> 00:42:50,537
And look at this.

00:42:50,537 --> 00:42:52,472
Look.
I'm related
to Buffalo Bill Cody.

00:42:52,472 --> 00:42:54,575
That is so cool.
