00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:30,347
BRODY: I'm not saying
I don't like Vegas.

00:00:30,347 --> 00:00:32,216
I'm just saying L.A. clearly
owns it

00:00:32,216 --> 00:00:33,450
in a number of key categories.

00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,419
Vegas has no heart,
no history...

00:00:35,419 --> 00:00:37,054
SANDERS: No history?

00:00:37,054 --> 00:00:38,923
RUSSELL: No taxes ought
to quiet your complaints.

00:00:38,923 --> 00:00:40,724
BRODY:
No ocean.

00:00:40,724 --> 00:00:42,326
SANDERS:
All right, Morgan,
I'll give you the ocean.

00:00:42,326 --> 00:00:44,395
And the weather,
and the Lakers.

00:00:44,395 --> 00:00:46,130
And the ability to walk
down the street

00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,299
without being handed
full-frontal business cards.

00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:50,401
Okay, but if you think L.A.
beats Vegas at night,

00:00:50,401 --> 00:00:51,836
you need professional help.

00:00:51,836 --> 00:00:53,804
Oh! You offering your services?

00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:56,373
RUSSELL:
Hey, guys, please,
we're here for a crime scene.

00:00:56,373 --> 00:00:58,809
(helicopter rotors whirring)
What is that?

00:01:09,386 --> 00:01:11,922
CSI Russell?

00:01:11,922 --> 00:01:13,958
Rescue helicopter?
Yes, sir.

00:01:13,958 --> 00:01:15,326
We just drove 70 miles.

00:01:15,326 --> 00:01:16,727
We were promised murder.

00:01:16,727 --> 00:01:18,229
And you had it,
till 30 minutes ago.

00:01:18,229 --> 00:01:20,064
What, the vic came
back to life?

00:01:20,064 --> 00:01:22,066
He didn't have a pulse when
I found him on my patrol.

00:01:22,066 --> 00:01:24,802
Called it in-- all
of a sudden, he groans.

00:01:24,802 --> 00:01:28,038
Document everything
before we lose him.

00:01:28,038 --> 00:01:30,241
GSW in the shoulder.
Right, let's
get him loaded.

00:01:30,241 --> 00:01:32,176
Looks like a bullet graze
wound on the forehead.

00:01:32,176 --> 00:01:34,812
Two gunshot wounds,
no blood pool?

00:01:34,812 --> 00:01:36,680
This can't be
the primary.

00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,250
Get a shot of his wrist.
Those are abrasions.

00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,384
That guy was bound.

00:01:40,384 --> 00:01:41,852
(phone rings)
Yeah. And burned.

00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:43,854
Looks like two stun gun
marks on his neck.

00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:45,856
EMT:
Spike 80-50 push.

00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:47,424
No wallet?
Nothing.

00:01:47,424 --> 00:01:48,826
Yeah!

00:01:48,826 --> 00:01:50,227
Hey, it's Nick.

00:01:50,227 --> 00:01:52,329
I just landed
a double in Northtown.

00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:54,265
Is there anybody around
who can give me a hand?

00:01:54,265 --> 00:01:56,000
Catherine
and Sara are in court.

00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,735
It's your lucky day.

00:01:57,735 --> 00:02:00,237
Our Mount Stirling D.B. just
Frankensteined on me.

00:02:00,237 --> 00:02:03,340
So I'll send someone your way.
Okay, that'd be good. Thanks.

00:02:05,342 --> 00:02:08,112
Hey, Greg, why don't you
hop on the chopper?

00:02:08,112 --> 00:02:11,048
Process our vic at the hospital,
then head over to Northtown.

00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:13,217
Nick has a double
he's having trouble with.

00:02:13,217 --> 00:02:16,120
Oh, you want me to leave this
gorgeous crime scenery?

00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,388
I'll do it.

00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:20,224
All right, you go.

00:02:20,224 --> 00:02:23,060
We'll stay.
A chopper ride and
a double homicide?

00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,195
I'm up for some excitement.

00:02:38,242 --> 00:02:41,412
♪ Who... are you? ♪

00:02:41,412 --> 00:02:44,181

00:02:59,029 --> 00:03:01,031

00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:27,424
(phone ringing)

00:03:27,424 --> 00:03:28,993
Miss me already?

00:03:28,993 --> 00:03:31,161
Head 50 yards
from your 3:00.

00:03:31,161 --> 00:03:33,063
I think I just found
the rest of your scene.

00:03:33,063 --> 00:03:35,199
I won't tell Russell
I gave you the tip.

00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:36,800
You can look smart
and owe me one.

00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,235
All right, thanks.

00:03:42,673 --> 00:03:45,442
Hey, sweetheart, it might
get a little bumpy.

00:03:51,181 --> 00:03:53,050
No sign of forced entry.

00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:56,353
Mailman spotted them through
the iron barred windows.

00:03:56,353 --> 00:03:58,822
Mailman delivers door-to-door
in this neighborhood?

00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:01,091
Takes some serious mail-sack.

00:04:01,091 --> 00:04:02,126
Yeah.

00:04:02,126 --> 00:04:03,761
So was the TV

00:04:03,761 --> 00:04:05,996
or stereo on when the officers
responded?

00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:07,998
The whole system was blaring.

00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:09,666
I know both of these guys.

00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,835
Wes Aykin, Tony Malos.

00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:14,238
I busted them for some
juvie stuff a while back,

00:04:14,238 --> 00:04:15,406
but now their ink

00:04:15,406 --> 00:04:17,708
tells me they've turned pro.

00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:18,809
Yeah, "Mad-10"?

00:04:18,809 --> 00:04:20,377
Madison and Tenth.

00:04:20,377 --> 00:04:23,013
That's the gang/syndicate
that runs this hood.

00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:26,750
Diversified portfolio--
drugs, extortion,

00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,719
prostitution,
Internet porn.

00:04:28,719 --> 00:04:31,255
STOKES: Mm-hmm, and
quite the racket with
the fake credit cards.

00:04:31,255 --> 00:04:34,425
The killer sure did leave
behind a lot of plastic.

00:04:34,425 --> 00:04:37,261
You know, it doesn't seem like
this was about business.

00:04:37,261 --> 00:04:39,263
Maybe it was personal.

00:04:50,974 --> 00:04:52,910
Metal shavings.

00:04:57,314 --> 00:05:00,284
Coming from the back door.

00:05:03,253 --> 00:05:05,722
Yep. Here's our
point of entry.

00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,057
Plasma cutter.

00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:08,692
Slashed right
through the metal.

00:05:10,694 --> 00:05:15,232
<i>Inert gas and an electrical arc</i>
<i>create an ultra-hot plasma</i>

00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:19,069
<i>that chews right through</i>
<i>the metal.</i>

00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:34,284
Hey, here it is right here.

00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:43,427
"Stolen from Ronston Welding."

00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:45,229
I'll give 'em a call.

00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:47,831
Casa de Brass could use
some discounted pipe work.

00:05:53,403 --> 00:05:55,272
(steady electronic tone)

00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:56,340
What can I do?

00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,242
Just stand back.

00:05:58,242 --> 00:06:00,177
I've got epi running.
He's gone back into V-fib.

00:06:00,177 --> 00:06:01,912
I'm going to shock again.

00:06:01,912 --> 00:06:02,946
Clear.

00:06:04,348 --> 00:06:06,984
Actually, lift the lids.

00:06:06,984 --> 00:06:08,952
No pupil reaction.

00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:11,255
One more time.
Clear.

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,328
(steady beeping)

00:06:18,328 --> 00:06:20,397
There we go.
Welcome back, buddy.

00:06:20,397 --> 00:06:21,798
You're on your way

00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,333
to the hospital.

00:06:27,938 --> 00:06:30,274
(mutters):
Samantha...

00:06:32,442 --> 00:06:34,411
Samantha.

00:06:48,792 --> 00:06:50,661
Hey, boys.

00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:52,095
Didn't hear
you come in.

00:06:52,095 --> 00:06:53,697
What's going on?

00:06:53,697 --> 00:06:55,199
We already flipped 'em
and sticked 'em.

00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,433
Both died around midnight.

00:06:58,101 --> 00:07:00,103
I notice some burn marks
on the neck

00:07:00,103 --> 00:07:01,972
consistent with
a stun gun.

00:07:01,972 --> 00:07:04,975
Those are some pretty
nasty neck wounds.

00:07:04,975 --> 00:07:06,410
ROBBINS:
They were both garroted.

00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:08,745
I found that wire
under this victim.

00:07:11,215 --> 00:07:13,016
Hmm.

00:07:16,987 --> 00:07:19,156
Okay.

00:07:19,156 --> 00:07:20,791
This attack was
clearly planned.

00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:23,794
The killer used a plasma cutter
to gain entry.

00:07:23,794 --> 00:07:25,796
<i>He must have known it was</i>
<i>a good time to strike.</i>

00:07:25,796 --> 00:07:27,965
Yo, where's the beer?

00:07:27,965 --> 00:07:30,200
What the...?!

00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,236
(stun gun crackling)

00:07:32,236 --> 00:07:34,671
Why are you doing this to us?!

00:07:37,841 --> 00:07:41,011
ROBBINS: <i>There are easier</i>
<i>ways to end two men.</i>

00:07:41,011 --> 00:07:43,013
The killer was either
getting off,

00:07:43,013 --> 00:07:45,415
or trying to get
something out of them.

00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,022
RUSSELL:
You sure about this, Greg?

00:07:52,022 --> 00:07:54,391
Sure as
I can be.

00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:58,061
RUSSELL:
Oh, there you go.

00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:00,230
Good hunch, buddy.
Way to call it.

00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:03,700
Eh, just trusting my instincts.

00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:08,772
(camera shutter clicking)

00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:15,012
Looks like we've got two nine
mill casings over here.

00:08:21,985 --> 00:08:25,689
So one shot goes into our
victim's shoulder,

00:08:25,689 --> 00:08:27,791
and... Oh, yes.

00:08:29,059 --> 00:08:31,762
One shot grazes his head.

00:08:31,762 --> 00:08:33,397
(gunshots)

00:08:33,397 --> 00:08:36,266
Definitely our primary.

00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:38,068
SANDERS:
Maybe more than that.

00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:41,438
Second blood pool.

00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:43,440
Two more casings.

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,677
We got a second
gunshot victim?
I don't know.

00:08:46,677 --> 00:08:48,312
Not much blood.

00:08:48,312 --> 00:08:51,715
And it looks like the ground
took the brunt of these shots.

00:08:57,187 --> 00:09:00,190
No blood or tissue
on these bullets.

00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:02,192
Maybe they didn't hit anybody.

00:09:02,192 --> 00:09:05,429
Okay, so maybe both
of our blood pools come from

00:09:05,429 --> 00:09:08,732
our guy on the chopper, right?

00:09:10,867 --> 00:09:12,803
Let's keep looking.

00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,416
Ah, found his jacket.

00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:29,252
And I think I found his ride.

00:09:29,252 --> 00:09:31,688
Tire impressions.

00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,125
Wide axle.

00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:37,094
Pickup or SUV?

00:09:37,094 --> 00:09:39,863
So they drive our victim up
here, they shoot him,

00:09:39,863 --> 00:09:42,032
and then they
leave him for dead.

00:09:42,032 --> 00:09:44,434
His hands and knees
were caked with dirt.

00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:49,406
<i>He tried to crawl to the road.</i>

00:09:54,378 --> 00:09:56,279
Yeah, here we go.

00:09:57,414 --> 00:09:59,249
Got a bloody print.

00:09:59,249 --> 00:10:02,419
I'll send a photo
to Mandy for an I.D.

00:10:04,788 --> 00:10:06,757
BRASS:
Save your powder.

00:10:06,757 --> 00:10:08,091
We have a suspect.

00:10:08,091 --> 00:10:09,826
Yeah? Who is it?
Ronston the welder

00:10:09,826 --> 00:10:11,428
told me that an assistant of his

00:10:11,428 --> 00:10:13,263
ran off with a bunch of
equipment last night,

00:10:13,263 --> 00:10:14,931
and didn't show up
for work today.

00:10:14,931 --> 00:10:16,967
His name is Frank Cafferty
and he has a record.

00:10:16,967 --> 00:10:18,668
Got out six months ago

00:10:18,668 --> 00:10:21,972
after doing a ten-year stint
for manslaughter.

00:10:21,972 --> 00:10:24,441
RUSSELL:
Ah, thatagirl, Mandy.

00:10:24,441 --> 00:10:27,310
Look, she sent us
a match for our print.

00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:28,879
So our guy in the chopper

00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:32,916
is a Frank Cafferty.

00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:34,918
That's a little weird.

00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:41,091
(phone ringing)

00:10:41,091 --> 00:10:42,959
Stokes.

00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,327
Yeah, Nick, you just
entered a print

00:10:44,327 --> 00:10:45,962
for a Frank Cafferty
into the system.

00:10:45,962 --> 00:10:47,364
Yeah, he's my suspect
over here.

00:10:47,364 --> 00:10:50,100
Double homicide.
Yeah, he's our victim.

00:10:52,169 --> 00:10:54,271
You mean the exact same guy
that's...

00:10:54,271 --> 00:10:56,072
Yeah, up in the air
with Morgan.

00:11:00,677 --> 00:11:04,014
Hell, you're a fighter.
PILOT:
This is Medevac 103.

00:11:04,014 --> 00:11:07,184
(phone ringing)
Estimated time of arrival
at Desert Palm 0945.

00:11:07,184 --> 00:11:09,152
Tracing Route 160
toward Wilson Ridge.

00:11:09,152 --> 00:11:10,787
Still in the air, boss.

00:11:12,823 --> 00:11:14,825
Really?

00:11:14,825 --> 00:11:16,426
The Northtown double?

00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,398
Copy that.

00:11:21,398 --> 00:11:24,401
I'll make sure he's in custody
when we land.

00:11:24,401 --> 00:11:25,902
(phone beeps off)

00:11:30,207 --> 00:11:33,043
He's convulsing!
Protect him!

00:11:33,043 --> 00:11:35,145
Get the I.V.--

00:11:35,145 --> 00:11:37,814
Hey! Get back!

00:11:41,351 --> 00:11:42,953
Hey!

00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:44,788
I see you touch that radio,
or punch in codes,

00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:45,889
bitch is dead,
you hear me?

00:11:45,889 --> 00:11:47,958
Yeah.
Unstrap me.

00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,293
I said unstrap me
or the cop eats it!

00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:51,995
I'm not a cop...
Now!

00:12:09,846 --> 00:12:11,214
Listen up!

00:12:11,214 --> 00:12:12,916
I want your cans off
and your cell phones!

00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:14,117
Throw 'em back!

00:12:14,117 --> 00:12:16,086
Now! Hurry up!
Come on!

00:12:16,086 --> 00:12:17,754
Now!

00:12:22,926 --> 00:12:25,996
You! Due south. Fly low.

00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:29,132
I see a town, a cop,
or a highway,

00:12:29,132 --> 00:12:30,834
it's the last
thing you see.

00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:32,669
You got it?

00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:33,937
Yeah.

00:12:36,306 --> 00:12:37,774
Where are we going?

00:12:37,774 --> 00:12:39,843
Mexico.

00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:43,380
I'm not sure how much "we"
there's gonna be about it.

00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,048
(panting)

00:12:51,288 --> 00:12:53,757
RUSSELL: So Morgan's still
not at your scene?

00:12:53,757 --> 00:12:55,091
STOKES:
No, it's been over an hour.

00:12:55,091 --> 00:12:56,893
She should've gotten there
by now.

00:12:56,893 --> 00:12:59,162
All right, well, I'll check
with Medevac Dispatch.

00:12:59,162 --> 00:13:00,363
Do you still
need a hand?

00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:01,865
STOKES:
Nah, I'm good.

00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:03,833
Catherine and Sarah
finished in court

00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:05,936
and they're checking out
Frank Cafferty's address.

00:13:05,936 --> 00:13:08,104
All right, good.
Thank you.

00:13:08,104 --> 00:13:10,440
No service on Morgan's cell.

00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,075
WOMAN:
Dispatch.

00:13:12,075 --> 00:13:15,011
Uh, yeah, this is D.B. Russell
with Crime Lab.

00:13:15,011 --> 00:13:17,981
Do you have an ETA
on a Medevac Three,

00:13:17,981 --> 00:13:21,685
heading from Mount Stirling
to Desert Palm Hospital?

00:13:21,685 --> 00:13:24,154
Negative. We've been unable
to reestablish radio contact

00:13:24,154 --> 00:13:26,022
with Medevac Three.

00:13:26,022 --> 00:13:28,358
All right, well, check
with Air Traffic Control,

00:13:28,358 --> 00:13:29,726
will you, please?

00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:32,062
Yes, sir.

00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:35,832
Maybe they're taking
the scenic route.

00:13:35,832 --> 00:13:37,701
ROBBINS:
Looks like a match.

00:13:37,701 --> 00:13:39,336
Stun gun burns on
Frank Cafferty's neck

00:13:39,336 --> 00:13:41,671
and the necks
of these dead Mad-10s

00:13:41,671 --> 00:13:42,872
are three of a kind.

00:13:42,872 --> 00:13:45,175
Well, Sara and I
just got back

00:13:45,175 --> 00:13:46,710
from Cafferty's apartment.

00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:48,011
The door had
been kicked in,

00:13:48,011 --> 00:13:49,346
there were signs
of a struggle...

00:13:49,346 --> 00:13:52,082
So Cafferty zapped and killed

00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:55,085
<i>these fine gentlemen</i>
<i>in Northtown,</i>

00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:57,087
retired for the evening...

00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:59,322
Somebody else-- probably
from their crew--

00:13:59,322 --> 00:14:01,725
went after Frank,
busted into his place,

00:14:01,725 --> 00:14:03,226
used a stun gun on him,

00:14:03,226 --> 00:14:05,362
<i>then dragged him out</i>
<i>and up to the mountains.</i>

00:14:05,362 --> 00:14:08,098
Any idea what started the feud?

00:14:08,098 --> 00:14:09,799
Well, Frank'll be at
the hospital soon.

00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:11,968
I'm sure he's got
all kinds of answers.

00:14:27,317 --> 00:14:29,219
Who's Samantha?

00:14:32,722 --> 00:14:34,157
You might've been dreaming.

00:14:34,157 --> 00:14:36,292
You kind of muttered it
while you were under.

00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,795
I wasn't dreaming.

00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:41,998
Is she someone special?

00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:48,071
What'd you do?
Nothing.

00:14:48,071 --> 00:14:49,706
You moved!
You're trying to do something.

00:14:49,706 --> 00:14:50,840
I didn't move.
You're on medication.

00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,175
Your vision's compromised.

00:14:52,175 --> 00:14:53,677
Oh, yeah? You want
to test my vision, Doc?

00:14:53,677 --> 00:14:54,944
Frank, come on,
it's not worth it.

00:14:58,048 --> 00:14:59,382
Please...

00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:03,286
Put him down.
What?

00:15:03,286 --> 00:15:04,854
Drug him! I don't
want him moving!

00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:07,157
I said drug him.

00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:09,059
You got five seconds:
five... four...

00:15:09,059 --> 00:15:11,795
Midazolam-- two ccs,
front pouch, clear bottle.

00:15:13,763 --> 00:15:15,298
Hurry! Do it!

00:15:15,298 --> 00:15:16,332
Quit eyeballing me.

00:15:19,703 --> 00:15:20,804
Turn around!

00:15:24,741 --> 00:15:25,909
Hurry up!

00:15:31,981 --> 00:15:33,149
(grunts)

00:15:35,118 --> 00:15:38,321
That's right.
Now, sit back...

00:15:38,321 --> 00:15:40,090
enjoy the ride.

00:15:44,928 --> 00:15:47,897
Okay, thanks, Jim.

00:15:47,897 --> 00:15:49,299
So Brass dug in
to Cafferty's file.

00:15:49,299 --> 00:15:51,000
There were no
gang connections.

00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,069
The guy spent the past
ten years in prison

00:15:53,069 --> 00:15:54,671
for a bar fight gone bad.

00:15:54,671 --> 00:15:57,407
There was no gang beef
while he was in lockup,

00:15:57,407 --> 00:16:00,343
and prior to prison,
he was in the service--

00:16:00,343 --> 00:16:01,945
chopper pilot.

00:16:01,945 --> 00:16:03,213
You know, I've been

00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:05,248
going through the stuff
from his apartment--

00:16:05,248 --> 00:16:07,383
you know, he doesn't
strike me as a gangbanger.

00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,185
WILLOWS: So what was he
doing in that house,

00:16:09,185 --> 00:16:11,654
torturing and killing
two Mad-10s?

00:16:11,654 --> 00:16:13,823
Did Brass say anything
about a daughter?

00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,825
Actually, yes.

00:16:15,825 --> 00:16:19,429
His Army file claimed
that he was divorced
with one dependent.

00:16:19,429 --> 00:16:21,965
Hm.

00:16:21,965 --> 00:16:24,667
Daughter's name is Samantha.

00:16:24,667 --> 00:16:26,936
She sent him a letter in
prison, four years ago.

00:16:26,936 --> 00:16:28,938
"I've got a better
man in my life now.

00:16:28,938 --> 00:16:31,007
"He looks out for me
like you never have.

00:16:31,007 --> 00:16:34,177
You asked me for a recent
photo-- here you go."

00:16:34,177 --> 00:16:36,713
Well, she grew up.

00:16:36,713 --> 00:16:37,781
Ouch.

00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:42,085
I've seen him before.

00:16:45,288 --> 00:16:47,690
That's one of the Mad-10s
that Frank Cafferty killed.

00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:49,225
Now we know why.

00:16:49,225 --> 00:16:50,760
So the daughter
is the connection.

00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,362
(phone rings)

00:16:52,362 --> 00:16:54,998
Hi, Russell.

00:16:59,702 --> 00:17:01,738
And that's all we know?

00:17:01,738 --> 00:17:04,073
Hey... we need to talk.

00:17:04,073 --> 00:17:06,743
Uh-oh. Which one
was it this time?

00:17:06,743 --> 00:17:08,411
Morgan.

00:17:08,411 --> 00:17:09,779
Well, that didn't
take long.

00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:10,780
How'd she screw up?

00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:11,915
Well, she didn't, actually.

00:17:11,915 --> 00:17:13,683
Let me talk to you
for a second.

00:17:15,185 --> 00:17:17,320
She hitched a ride
on a medevac helicopter

00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,356
that was supposed
to land an hour ago.

00:17:20,356 --> 00:17:22,158
No sign of it yet.

00:17:22,158 --> 00:17:24,394
Was there a distress call?

00:17:24,394 --> 00:17:27,864
No. No radio,
no transponder signal,

00:17:27,864 --> 00:17:30,233
no appearance on radar.

00:17:30,233 --> 00:17:33,236
Now, look-- this is my team,
my responsibility.

00:17:33,236 --> 00:17:34,404
Yeah-- my daughter.

00:17:34,404 --> 00:17:36,039
I know. I know.

00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:37,907
Then again, you're
a better supervisor

00:17:37,907 --> 00:17:39,209
than I ever was a father.

00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:43,813
Air Traffic Control
better have some answers.

00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:45,748
SANDERS: <i>When he took off</i>
<i>from Mount Stirling,</i>

00:17:45,748 --> 00:17:47,917
<i>the pilot reported</i>
<i>his flight plan to Dispatch.</i>

00:17:47,917 --> 00:17:49,686
PILOT:
Estimated time of arrival...

00:17:49,686 --> 00:17:51,354
SANDERS: <i>Because of the</i>
<i>patient's head wound,</i>

00:17:51,354 --> 00:17:52,789
<i>he wanted to avoid altitude,</i>

00:17:52,789 --> 00:17:54,290
so he was going
to trace Route 160

00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:56,893
and cut across Wilson Ridge
toward the city.

00:17:56,893 --> 00:17:58,761
Now, McCarran radar
can't pick up aircraft

00:17:58,761 --> 00:18:00,263
blocked by the mountains,

00:18:00,263 --> 00:18:03,700
but at the last radio update
to Dispatch, at 9:27 a.m.,

00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,201
the copter was here.

00:18:05,201 --> 00:18:07,337
Now, it should've emerged
from behind the mountains,

00:18:07,337 --> 00:18:09,906
and onto McCarran radar
six or seven minutes later.

00:18:09,906 --> 00:18:11,241
It never emerged.

00:18:11,241 --> 00:18:13,176
Archie pinged the
cells of Morgan,

00:18:13,176 --> 00:18:14,777
the pilot and paramedic--

00:18:14,777 --> 00:18:16,412
all three were emanating
from a one-acre area

00:18:16,412 --> 00:18:17,814
here.

00:18:19,449 --> 00:18:21,384
<i>Sheriff's deputies</i>
<i>recovered the phones,</i>

00:18:21,384 --> 00:18:24,354
<i>but no sign of any wreckage.</i>

00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:28,224
Cafferty-- he made 'em
toss the phones.

00:18:28,224 --> 00:18:29,659
That chopper's hijacked.

00:18:29,659 --> 00:18:31,127
Okay...

00:18:31,127 --> 00:18:32,962
All right,
we keep working the case.

00:18:32,962 --> 00:18:35,231
I want to find out everything
we can about Frank Cafferty,

00:18:35,231 --> 00:18:37,901
in case we make
contact with him.

00:18:37,901 --> 00:18:39,936
I was supposed to be
the CSI on that flight.

00:18:39,936 --> 00:18:42,038
We don't have time
for that right now.

00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:43,339
Let's just stay focused,

00:18:43,339 --> 00:18:45,441
and make sure we bring
our girl home, okay?

00:18:45,441 --> 00:18:48,444
Why don't you check out Sara,
see what she's got.

00:18:48,444 --> 00:18:51,247
So I think I know why Cafferty
was at that Northtown house--

00:18:51,247 --> 00:18:53,416
he was looking for
his daughter.

00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:56,419
Samantha used to go out
with Wes Aykin,

00:18:56,419 --> 00:18:59,055
one of the dead Mad-10s.

00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:01,858
So, Cafferty figures that
Wes and the rest of the gang

00:19:01,858 --> 00:19:03,126
might know where
she was, right?

00:19:03,126 --> 00:19:04,861
Well, it was more than a hunch.

00:19:04,861 --> 00:19:06,763
He had seen some awful proof.

00:19:06,763 --> 00:19:08,064
I'd found a Web address

00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:09,432
jotted among Frank's
possessions.

00:19:09,432 --> 00:19:11,868
The URL-- it's a
file-sharing site.

00:19:11,868 --> 00:19:13,937
Specifically, one file.

00:19:17,006 --> 00:19:18,241
Porn video.

00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:20,243
She looks drugged.

00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:21,678
Yeah.

00:19:21,678 --> 00:19:23,079
So Cafferty sees this

00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:24,847
and wants to
rescue his daughter.

00:19:24,847 --> 00:19:27,817
Tries to strangle her
whereabouts out of Wes and Tony.

00:19:27,817 --> 00:19:28,985
Right?
Mm-hmm.

00:19:28,985 --> 00:19:30,219
So do we know where she is?

00:19:30,219 --> 00:19:32,922
No. She renewed
her license a month ago,

00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:35,291
but the address
she used is a weekly,

00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:37,226
and she's no longer there.

00:19:37,226 --> 00:19:38,895
Tire treads Greg photo'd

00:19:38,895 --> 00:19:40,363
at the mountain scene.

00:19:40,363 --> 00:19:42,699
They're high-end run-flats--

00:19:42,699 --> 00:19:44,834
standard on a number
of luxury SUVs--

00:19:44,834 --> 00:19:46,836
Lexus, BMW, Porsche...

00:19:46,836 --> 00:19:48,938
Cafferty had a digital camera.

00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:51,307
There were some amateur
surveillance photos on it.

00:19:51,307 --> 00:19:52,675
He was tracking

00:19:52,675 --> 00:19:54,110
the Mad-10s.

00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:56,012
Probably since he
got out of prison.

00:19:56,012 --> 00:20:00,183
Their properties,
cars, including...

00:20:00,183 --> 00:20:01,951
a Porsche Cayenne.

00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:03,252
So that could be the vehicle

00:20:03,252 --> 00:20:05,021
that took Cafferty
up into the mountains.

00:20:05,021 --> 00:20:06,289
WILLOWS:
Partial plate--

00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:07,991
I'll run it through DMV.

00:20:07,991 --> 00:20:11,327
I had all the techs
and interns

00:20:11,327 --> 00:20:13,696
put out a photo file
on the copter--

00:20:13,696 --> 00:20:15,131
e-mail, Twitter--

00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:18,267
saying that:
If you see this, let us know.

00:20:18,267 --> 00:20:19,836
Good idea.

00:20:19,836 --> 00:20:22,972
She's a really good CSI.

00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,042
Nick, you got anything?

00:20:26,042 --> 00:20:27,944
Twentynine Palms
Marine Corps Base,

00:20:27,944 --> 00:20:29,812
100 miles south
of Mount Stirling,

00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:32,148
reported a non-transponding
radio-silent craft

00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:33,950
in their airspace
15 minutes ago.

00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:36,219
Guy in the tower said it
looked like Medevac Three.

00:20:36,219 --> 00:20:38,087
By the time we
got the message,
it was off radar.

00:20:38,087 --> 00:20:39,756
RUSSELL:
So they're heading due south.

00:20:39,756 --> 00:20:41,224
What, Mexico?

00:20:41,224 --> 00:20:42,892
CHP's on the lookout,
but they haven't seen it.

00:20:42,892 --> 00:20:44,427
You know, Cafferty
may have the pilot

00:20:44,427 --> 00:20:46,262
zigging and zagging
around up there.

00:20:46,262 --> 00:20:47,897
Yeah, well, even if they're
straight-lining it,

00:20:47,897 --> 00:20:49,032
they're gonna
have to refuel

00:20:49,032 --> 00:20:50,933
before they
get to the border.

00:20:50,933 --> 00:20:52,802
Every airstrip between here and
there's got a heads-up, so...

00:20:52,802 --> 00:20:54,170
I got that DNA on the
two blood pools

00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,671
you and Greg found
at the mountain scene.

00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,240
The big pool was Cafferty.

00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,075
The small pool was a second
contributor-- a female.

00:20:59,075 --> 00:21:00,676
Cafferty's daughter?

00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,412
No, a 19-year-old
named Tiffany Bamford.

00:21:02,412 --> 00:21:05,181
She's got priors for assault;
and ties to the Mad-10s.

00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:07,750
And I checked hospitals--
she's at Desert Palm.

00:21:10,086 --> 00:21:12,255
They didn't want me
comin' here but...

00:21:12,255 --> 00:21:14,090
my head just kept
hurting worse.

00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:16,659
Who didn't want you
to come here, Tiffany?

00:21:16,659 --> 00:21:18,795
Who did this to you?
Hmm?

00:21:18,795 --> 00:21:20,129
Was it the Mad-10s?

00:21:20,129 --> 00:21:21,664
They said they weren't really

00:21:21,664 --> 00:21:23,366
going to do anything to me.

00:21:23,366 --> 00:21:25,001
Supposed to be fake.

00:21:25,001 --> 00:21:27,837
Just mess with this guy.
Get some cred.

00:21:27,837 --> 00:21:29,772
They took me out there.

00:21:29,772 --> 00:21:31,207
Want your daughter,
Frank?

00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:32,241
Here she is.

00:21:32,241 --> 00:21:33,276
No...

00:21:34,911 --> 00:21:36,412
Look what you've made
us do to her!

00:21:36,412 --> 00:21:37,346
No!

00:21:39,315 --> 00:21:41,417
Samantha!

00:21:41,417 --> 00:21:43,219
No!

00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:45,088
Samantha!

00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:46,255
Samantha!

00:21:46,255 --> 00:21:47,323
I'm gonna kill you!

00:21:47,323 --> 00:21:48,424
You hear me?

00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:50,960
No! No!

00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,061
Samantha!

00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:53,229
Tell me their names.

00:21:55,798 --> 00:21:57,900
I'll protect you,
I promise.

00:22:08,778 --> 00:22:10,079
Can I help you
with something?

00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:11,781
Thought this was
my grandmother's room.

00:22:11,781 --> 00:22:13,282
Yeah, well, it's not.
My mistake.

00:22:13,282 --> 00:22:15,218
Yeah, it is your
mistake. Beat it.

00:22:19,655 --> 00:22:21,757
Now, Tiffany, we can post
an officer

00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,693
right outside of your room...
Get out.

00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:26,195
Get out!

00:22:29,899 --> 00:22:32,935
So these guys wanted Frank
to think they killed Samantha.

00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:36,272
The fact that they had
to fake it says... what?

00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:39,175
She was already dead but they
couldn't produce a body?

00:22:39,175 --> 00:22:41,444
Or she's still alive; they
couldn't get their hands on her.

00:22:41,444 --> 00:22:43,379
And what if we did?

00:22:43,379 --> 00:22:45,748
What if we find her, and let
Frank know she's still alive?

00:22:45,748 --> 00:22:47,750
That might just bring him
back down.

00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,852
Yeah, but how are we gonna
find her? No address,
no phone number.

00:22:49,852 --> 00:22:51,854
And in the meantime,
Frank Cafferty

00:22:51,854 --> 00:22:53,856
thinks he watched
his own daughter's murder.

00:22:53,856 --> 00:22:58,060
I can't help but think what that
might mean for my daughter.

00:23:12,008 --> 00:23:13,442
She's dead.

00:23:15,778 --> 00:23:18,781
My daughter, Samantha.

00:23:18,781 --> 00:23:21,751
You asked.

00:23:27,023 --> 00:23:29,125
What happened?

00:23:29,125 --> 00:23:32,128
When she was little,
I was, um...

00:23:32,128 --> 00:23:34,363
I was a bad person, you know?

00:23:34,363 --> 00:23:36,766
I went away.
She ended up

00:23:36,766 --> 00:23:41,070
getting mixed in
with the wrong crowd.

00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:44,941
When I got out...

00:23:44,941 --> 00:23:47,443
I tried to save her.

00:23:47,443 --> 00:23:50,746
You wanted a second chance.
Yeah.

00:23:52,815 --> 00:23:54,784
Ended up getting her killed.

00:23:54,784 --> 00:23:57,053
How?

00:24:05,061 --> 00:24:06,762
A month ago,
I sat down with my dad

00:24:06,762 --> 00:24:10,066
for the first time
in a dozen years.

00:24:10,066 --> 00:24:12,235
He left when you
were little, too?

00:24:12,235 --> 00:24:16,405
When I was about 14
and he'd messed up so much

00:24:16,405 --> 00:24:19,909
that my mom decided she wanted
to leave for California...

00:24:19,909 --> 00:24:23,179
he didn't fight for me to stay.

00:24:25,715 --> 00:24:28,918
If he'd only
just fought for me.

00:24:28,918 --> 00:24:31,821
That would've been enough?

00:24:36,726 --> 00:24:39,061
You finally forgave him?

00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:43,199
I finally decided
it was worth a shot.

00:24:43,199 --> 00:24:46,068
So we're starting over.

00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,209
Whatever mistakes he made...

00:24:53,209 --> 00:24:57,013
we can get past them.

00:24:57,013 --> 00:24:59,248
People change.

00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:02,218
He's a better man now.

00:25:02,218 --> 00:25:05,988
He had a second chance.

00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,797
(grunting and groaning)

00:25:14,797 --> 00:25:16,165
(gunshot)
(screams)

00:25:16,165 --> 00:25:18,100
Look what you made me do!

00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:21,804
(groans)
Look what you made me do!

00:25:21,804 --> 00:25:26,075
Don't you move.
You hear me? Don't you move.

00:25:26,075 --> 00:25:28,110
Okay.

00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,445
Excuse me, Undersheriff?

00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:31,147
This young woman needs
to talk to you.

00:25:31,147 --> 00:25:32,715
Not the time, Shelley.

00:25:32,715 --> 00:25:34,450
I saw on the news about my dad.

00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:37,219
The, uh, helicopter.

00:25:37,219 --> 00:25:40,389
Samantha.

00:25:40,389 --> 00:25:42,858
I want to help.

00:25:50,433 --> 00:25:51,967
Your father's been
up in the air

00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,302
with hostages
for over two hours.

00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:56,138
Do you have any idea
which way he's going?

00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:57,373
I don't know.

00:25:57,373 --> 00:26:00,743
I-I barely know him.

00:26:00,743 --> 00:26:03,012
Letters, when he was in prison,
a handful of weekends

00:26:03,012 --> 00:26:05,448
before that, but we have
never been close.

00:26:05,448 --> 00:26:07,783
You don't understand.
He was trying to save you.

00:26:07,783 --> 00:26:13,289
Samantha, your Dad knew that you
were caught up with the Mad-10s.

00:26:13,289 --> 00:26:15,991
He was trying
to rescue you.

00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:17,860
(sighs)

00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,962
I didn't need his help.

00:26:22,932 --> 00:26:25,101
I checked out of that
life a year ago.

00:26:25,101 --> 00:26:26,969
I'm sober.

00:26:26,969 --> 00:26:28,971
I'm just trying to live quiet.

00:26:30,806 --> 00:26:33,442
So, you know what,
all of this is just...

00:26:33,442 --> 00:26:36,812
No, you know what? My daughter
is on that helicopter.

00:26:36,812 --> 00:26:38,314
Along with an innocent pilot

00:26:38,314 --> 00:26:41,384
and a paramedic,
who both have families.

00:26:47,223 --> 00:26:49,358
I know.

00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:51,093
That's what they
said on the news.

00:26:51,093 --> 00:26:53,362
That's why I'm here.
Not to help him.

00:26:55,831 --> 00:26:59,435
I just don't want to see him
hurt anyone else.

00:27:02,705 --> 00:27:04,974
So how do I talk to him?

00:27:04,974 --> 00:27:06,876
(radio static crackles)

00:27:06,876 --> 00:27:08,711
OFFICER:
Frank Cafferty,
Samantha is alive

00:27:08,711 --> 00:27:09,879
and wants to talk to you.

00:27:09,879 --> 00:27:11,747
Do you copy?

00:27:11,747 --> 00:27:14,817
Frank Cafferty, Samantha is
alive and wants to talk to you.

00:27:14,817 --> 00:27:16,652
He's either not hearing it,
or he's not buying it.

00:27:16,652 --> 00:27:18,854
No, no, he's probably cruising
at a lower altitude.

00:27:18,854 --> 00:27:21,357
You know, he'll hear it
when he rises above the crest.

00:27:21,357 --> 00:27:25,194
I appreciate the
rationalization, I really do.

00:27:25,194 --> 00:27:26,762
When it comes to Morgan,

00:27:26,762 --> 00:27:28,964
I've become something of
a master at it.

00:27:28,964 --> 00:27:31,133
"She's 14; she
doesn't understand

00:27:31,133 --> 00:27:33,302
what her mom and I
are arguing about."

00:27:33,302 --> 00:27:37,840
"16-year-olds are all moody,
they... she doesn't mean it."

00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,176
"She'll call.
She's busy at school."

00:27:40,176 --> 00:27:42,211
"She's busy at work.
She'll call. She'll call."

00:27:42,211 --> 00:27:44,313
"She'll call."
And then she's here.

00:27:44,313 --> 00:27:46,215
Chip the size of
the stratosphere

00:27:46,215 --> 00:27:48,751
on her shoulder,
still vowing eternal vengeance

00:27:48,751 --> 00:27:49,919
against me, but, uh...

00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:51,353
Hey, you know what?

00:27:51,353 --> 00:27:53,088
This could be
a second chance for you guys.

00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:56,292
Maybe.

00:27:56,292 --> 00:27:59,128
It just cannot end like this.

00:28:02,298 --> 00:28:05,835
Hey, Catherine? That Porsche
Cayenne from Cafferty's
surveillance photos.

00:28:05,835 --> 00:28:08,337
DMV had only three matches
to the partial plate,

00:28:08,337 --> 00:28:10,706
but one of them was in
the Mad-10s' neighborhood.

00:28:10,706 --> 00:28:12,942
It's registered to an
Alexander Zadian.

00:28:12,942 --> 00:28:15,110
Brass says he's a shot caller
for the Mad-10s.

00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:18,180
Priors for assault, extortion,
possession with intent,

00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,082
and he's on the
street right now.

00:28:20,082 --> 00:28:22,751
And the best suspect
for the attempted murder
of Frank Cafferty.

00:28:22,751 --> 00:28:24,320
Uniforms are out
looking for Zadian.

00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,955
I will let you know
if their luck changes.
Thank you.

00:28:28,023 --> 00:28:29,425
PILOT:
Well, it's your call, Ace.

00:28:29,425 --> 00:28:31,260
We're ten minutes out from
Parham Airstrip.

00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,862
We touch down and refuel,

00:28:32,862 --> 00:28:34,296
or this party's not
going much longer.

00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:36,832
(groans)

00:28:36,832 --> 00:28:38,701
Shut him up!
Go to hell.

00:28:38,701 --> 00:28:40,870
We got to get him to a hospital.
Please, Frank.

00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:43,305
I'll stay with you. Just let us
land and get him some help.

00:28:43,305 --> 00:28:44,707
I can't.
Please!

00:28:44,707 --> 00:28:46,242
I can't do that!
(groans)

00:28:46,242 --> 00:28:48,344
Shut him up!
(groans)

00:28:56,118 --> 00:28:59,088
OFFICER:
Frank Cafferty, Samantha is
alive and wants to talk to you.

00:28:59,088 --> 00:29:00,923
Do you copy?

00:29:00,923 --> 00:29:04,093
Frank Cafferty, Samantha is
alive and wants to talk to you.

00:29:04,093 --> 00:29:05,394
Do you copy?

00:29:05,394 --> 00:29:06,662
(static crackles)

00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:09,265
This is Frank Cafferty.

00:29:09,265 --> 00:29:10,966
(whispers):
Come on.

00:29:10,966 --> 00:29:13,269
Frank? This is D.B.
Russell, L.V.P.D.

I'm... I'm fine.

00:29:42,798 --> 00:29:46,402

you were trying to rescue me.

00:29:46,402 --> 00:29:47,937
I tried, Samantha.

00:29:47,937 --> 00:29:50,105
I tried as hard as I could.

00:29:54,076 --> 00:29:55,911
You remember when I was little,

00:29:55,911 --> 00:29:59,281

you told me was mine?

00:29:59,281 --> 00:30:02,151
Of course I do, baby.

00:30:02,151 --> 00:30:03,819
Go there.
I've sent someone to

00:30:03,819 --> 00:30:05,321

I love you, Dad.

Get her out of here!

Hey, come on, man.
We're not gonna make it

00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,768
to the next airstrip.

00:30:19,768 --> 00:30:21,403
I got no problem
flying solo.

00:30:21,403 --> 00:30:23,939

Now, she didn't have
a cell phone on her, so...

00:30:43,692 --> 00:30:45,327
She might've stashed that
in her car at P.D.

00:30:45,327 --> 00:30:47,429

00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:48,931

00:30:48,931 --> 00:30:50,833

intercept or follow.

00:30:50,833 --> 00:30:52,101
Good.
Yeah, let's do it.

00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:57,706
Why not let Frank get away?

00:30:57,706 --> 00:31:00,209
Wouldn't it be safer for Morgan
and the others

00:31:00,209 --> 00:31:02,277
if we just let him land?

00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:04,213

00:31:04,213 --> 00:31:05,814

Now, what's more likely,

00:31:16,892 --> 00:31:17,993
that she wants to help him
or hurt him?

00:31:20,262 --> 00:31:22,931

You gonna be okay?

00:31:22,931 --> 00:31:24,667
