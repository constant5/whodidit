Are you or are you not
behind the bombings?

00:01:40,548 --> 00:01:43,749

At your residence, our CSIs

00:02:02,224 --> 00:02:04,225

sent her in to send Sara
on a wild-goose chase.

00:02:42,711 --> 00:02:45,812
The only one sending us
on a wild-goose chase is you.

00:02:45,812 --> 00:02:47,380
You only have your claws out

00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:50,681

your ex-husband and I.

00:02:50,681 --> 00:02:52,448

cared about.
I couldn't go on.

00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:20,824
I gave my patients three months
notice and I retired.

00:04:20,824 --> 00:04:21,265

00:04:21,265 --> 00:04:23,526
you sent your patient
into my casino?

00:04:23,526 --> 00:04:25,693
To enact revenge on the world?

00:04:25,693 --> 00:04:28,528
You told Grissom that you were
the one behind the bombings.

00:04:28,528 --> 00:04:29,261
I am.

00:04:29,261 --> 00:04:30,629

is someone is framing me,

00:04:37,365 --> 00:04:39,933

Red Room client of mine.

00:10:19,795 --> 00:10:21,829
A curious name popped up
in CODIS. Do you guys

00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:25,531
remember a man
named Jacob Wolfowitz?

00:10:25,531 --> 00:10:26,732
He was convicted of killing

00:10:26,732 --> 00:10:28,265
Lady Heather's
daughter years ago.

00:10:28,265 --> 00:10:30,500
He's also the man that
Lady Heather almost killed,

00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,201
until you intervened.

00:10:32,201 --> 00:10:33,635
(groans loudly)

00:10:34,902 --> 00:10:36,869
Heather! Stop it!

00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:38,504
Let me finish!

00:10:40,138 --> 00:10:41,539
(grunting)

00:10:41,539 --> 00:10:43,139
You cannot do this!

00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:44,540
(crying):
Please.

00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:47,508
I'm saying stop.

00:10:47,508 --> 00:10:49,275
(gasping, sobbing)

00:10:49,275 --> 00:10:52,611
It was Wolfowitz
in that suitcase.

00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:54,978
Wasn't he sentenced
to life in prison?

00:10:54,978 --> 00:10:56,513
ANDREWS: Well, he's out.

00:10:56,513 --> 00:10:58,414
Well, half of him, anyway.

00:10:58,414 --> 00:11:00,114
So, clearly, somebody out there

00:11:00,114 --> 00:11:01,848
is obsessed with Lady Heather,
and by the looks

00:11:01,848 --> 00:11:04,817
of what we found
in the suitcase...

00:11:04,817 --> 00:11:07,418
somebody might be obsessed
with you, too.

00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:25,126
WILLOWS:
Hard at work, I see.

00:11:25,126 --> 00:11:27,427
I am.

00:11:27,427 --> 00:11:29,594
Drawing sea creatures.

00:11:29,594 --> 00:11:31,562
Whales and sharks.

00:11:31,562 --> 00:11:34,431
Metaphor for Vegas,
if you think about it.

00:11:34,431 --> 00:11:36,198
Whales bring the money in,

00:11:36,198 --> 00:11:38,699
the sharks take it away.

00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:40,734
Whales are bigger
in size and stature,

00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:42,768
but they're
the submissive.

00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:46,002
Sharks are smaller, but they're
by far the more dominant.

00:11:48,037 --> 00:11:50,238
I think someone's out there
playing the dominant,

00:11:50,238 --> 00:11:53,840
but he's really the submissive.

00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,741
Okay.

00:11:56,741 --> 00:11:58,242
Listen... (clears throat)

00:11:58,242 --> 00:12:00,976
I need a favor.

00:12:00,976 --> 00:12:04,011
The new girl-- she's having
a bit of a rough one.

00:12:04,011 --> 00:12:05,245
She thinks she let you down.

00:12:05,245 --> 00:12:06,379
I was hoping
you might be able

00:12:06,379 --> 00:12:08,313
to help her process
the suitcase,

00:12:08,313 --> 00:12:10,881
give her a little
of that Grissom TLC?

00:12:10,881 --> 00:12:13,215
She could really use it.
I'd rather not.

00:12:13,215 --> 00:12:15,816
I'm quite content here.

00:12:15,816 --> 00:12:18,518
Where did that girl
come from, anyway?

00:12:20,186 --> 00:12:22,086
My vagina.

00:12:24,288 --> 00:12:26,121

00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:29,490
Grissom, that's Lindsey.

00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,424

00:12:32,725 --> 00:12:35,526

00:12:35,526 --> 00:12:37,061

This stuff's amazing.

00:12:48,766 --> 00:12:52,034
Whoever sent this video
was using homemade software

00:12:52,034 --> 00:12:53,835
to swirl the image, right?

00:12:53,835 --> 00:12:54,769
So, pixel

00:12:54,769 --> 00:12:58,404

reverse the digital concealment.

00:12:58,404 --> 00:13:03,906
It's like, uh, unscrambling
scrambled eggs or something, but

00:13:03,906 --> 00:13:06,107
I-I got an ear.

00:13:06,107 --> 00:13:09,476
And we know
that our bomber is Caucasian.

00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:14,011
SIDLE:
From what we can surmise from
the partially reassembled photo

00:13:14,011 --> 00:13:16,379
and the auditory voice analysis,
the person in the video

00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:18,947
is Caucasian, 40's maybe.

00:13:18,947 --> 00:13:22,082
We also believe that
the gender isn't female.

00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:25,617

the person in the video.

But you're not here alone
without Grissom

00:13:34,621 --> 00:13:37,089

You're here for another

00:13:40,024 --> 00:13:42,058
I'm here,
based on what I've shown you,

00:13:42,058 --> 00:13:46,394

any idea who's behind this.

00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:49,828
(sighs deeply)

00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:52,096
I've had thousands

00:13:52,096 --> 00:13:54,497
come through my domain

00:13:54,497 --> 00:13:56,064
Any one of them
can be after me

00:13:56,064 --> 00:13:57,932

00:13:57,932 --> 00:14:00,300
I'm not talking
about you, Heather.

00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,367
This is about Grissom.

00:14:02,367 --> 00:14:06,569
Why would one of your clients
or patients be after him?

00:14:06,569 --> 00:14:09,104
If you're not behind this,
then help me.

00:14:09,104 --> 00:14:11,606

No.

00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:55,727
I'm afraid I can't help you.

00:15:04,331 --> 00:15:06,332

Dust too lightly,
it acts impolitely.

00:15:15,469 --> 00:15:18,303
Hmm.

00:15:18,303 --> 00:15:19,571

00:23:19,367 --> 00:23:20,933
Human presence negative.

00:23:20,933 --> 00:23:22,534
So he's not
in the southeast corner.

00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:24,002
We can eliminate that region.

00:23:28,171 --> 00:23:29,704
Five more to go.

00:23:30,872 --> 00:23:31,973
(taps keys, computer beeping)

00:23:47,546 --> 00:23:48,947
(buzzing)

00:23:48,947 --> 00:23:50,815
Hey, green is back.

00:23:56,484 --> 00:23:59,686
(rapid beeping)

00:24:03,253 --> 00:24:04,821
(electronic chirp)

00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:13,125
(computer beeping)

00:24:20,329 --> 00:24:22,363
Oh, my.

00:24:22,363 --> 00:24:24,964
Here you are.

00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:27,832
(buzzing)
GRISSOM: Red's here.

00:24:27,832 --> 00:24:30,066
(rapid beeping)

00:24:33,368 --> 00:24:34,702
(electronic chirp)

00:24:34,702 --> 00:24:36,469
Finally, we got a hit.

00:24:36,469 --> 00:24:38,037
Red, human presence.

00:24:38,037 --> 00:24:40,871
Region two.
7,500 feet elevation.

00:24:40,871 --> 00:24:42,739
That's steep.
Top of the mountain.

00:24:42,739 --> 00:24:44,807
Due north,
Mount Charleston.

00:24:44,807 --> 00:24:46,308
Could be a hiker.

00:24:46,308 --> 00:24:47,742
Yeah.

00:24:47,742 --> 00:24:50,243
Could be a killer.

00:24:50,243 --> 00:24:51,911
WILLOWS:
I got here as soon as I could.

00:24:51,911 --> 00:24:53,611
Still searching.

00:24:53,611 --> 00:24:55,078
(computer blipping rapidly)

00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,881
It worked. We got a hit.

00:25:00,881 --> 00:25:02,048
Sara interrogated
that guy.

00:25:02,048 --> 00:25:05,150
He's one of the five
gold key suspects.

00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:06,918
Greg, grab Morgan.
We're heading out.

00:25:06,918 --> 00:25:08,151
We got a name and residence

00:25:08,151 --> 00:25:10,586
of the bomber:
1475 Coven Gardens Road.

00:25:10,586 --> 00:25:12,854
I'll meet you there.

00:25:12,854 --> 00:25:14,421
WILLOWS:
<i>Suspect's apartment is clear,</i>

00:25:14,421 --> 00:25:16,522
<i>but we have reports</i>
<i>of suspicious activity</i>

00:25:16,522 --> 00:25:18,423
<i>in the parking garage.</i>

00:25:18,423 --> 00:25:21,158
(car alarms blaring)

00:25:35,832 --> 00:25:38,433
(alarms continue blaring,
horns honking)

00:25:54,641 --> 00:25:55,707
You seeing this?!

00:25:55,707 --> 00:25:57,242
The timers are synchronized.

00:25:57,242 --> 00:25:59,509
We have less than five minutes
to figure this out.

00:25:59,509 --> 00:26:01,077
(sighs)

00:26:29,823 --> 00:26:33,325
♪ ♪

00:26:53,635 --> 00:26:56,236
WILLOWS: Dispatch, we are here
at the Maggadino Apartments

00:26:56,236 --> 00:26:58,371
off of Coven Gardens.
The entire garage

00:26:58,371 --> 00:27:00,872
is rigged with explosives
on timers.

00:27:00,872 --> 00:27:02,673
The building is fully occupied.

00:27:02,673 --> 00:27:04,040
We are in grave danger.

00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:07,241
Repeat, we are in grave danger.

00:27:09,976 --> 00:27:12,811
OFFICER:
Hold your fire!
He's wired!

00:27:17,813 --> 00:27:19,081
Dalton Betton?

00:27:19,081 --> 00:27:21,548
How is that possible?

00:27:23,816 --> 00:27:26,150
Mr. Grissom.

00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:28,885
His DNA wasn't a match.

00:27:31,587 --> 00:27:33,988
I push this button,

00:27:33,988 --> 00:27:36,722
your friends die.

00:27:36,722 --> 00:27:39,390
I pull this cord,

00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:41,024
we die.

00:27:42,458 --> 00:27:43,993
Finally...

00:27:43,993 --> 00:27:46,960
I have all the power.

00:27:52,597 --> 00:27:55,164
I hate to break it,
but we don't have time
for the bomb squad.

00:27:55,164 --> 00:27:56,899
This is our problem now.

00:27:56,899 --> 00:27:57,765
What kind of bomb

00:27:57,765 --> 00:27:59,800
is this?
SANDERS: Daisy chain bomb.

00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,667
If one goes off,
they all go off.

00:28:01,667 --> 00:28:03,568
Not to mention,
there's enough C-4 in here

00:28:03,568 --> 00:28:05,769
to take down
this entire apartment complex.

00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:06,469
Look, the only way out of this

00:28:06,469 --> 00:28:08,204
is we cut the wires
at the same time.

00:28:08,204 --> 00:28:10,305
We each have to take a car.
Cut on my verbal command.

00:28:10,305 --> 00:28:14,040
If we're a millisecond early or
late, the bombs will detonate.

00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,741
This building is filled
with civilians.

00:28:15,741 --> 00:28:16,808
We can't walk away from this.

00:28:16,808 --> 00:28:18,075
This is all
or nothing now.

00:28:18,075 --> 00:28:21,310
Do or die. You with me?

00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:22,077
Yeah.

00:28:22,077 --> 00:28:23,978
(car alarms blaring)

00:28:32,482 --> 00:28:36,584
Mr. Betton,
the illness you're concealing,

00:28:36,584 --> 00:28:38,084
is it cancer?

00:28:40,252 --> 00:28:41,986
Lymphoma.

00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:44,988
If one leaves his blood
in Lady Heather's house

00:28:44,988 --> 00:28:46,889
while undergoing
stem cell treatment,

00:28:46,889 --> 00:28:50,490
changing the genetic
complexion of his DNA,

00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:53,592
does that make him
two different people?

00:28:53,592 --> 00:28:58,294
Scientifically,
I have two genetic makeups.

00:28:58,294 --> 00:29:01,796
Your cheek swab
will tell you that.

00:29:01,796 --> 00:29:03,697
Philosophically,

00:29:03,697 --> 00:29:07,799
I sent those people in
to do my dirty work.

00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:08,966
All for the purpose

00:29:08,966 --> 00:29:13,035
of coming face-to-face with you.

00:29:15,315 --> 00:29:17,315
WILLOWS:
Four colors here.

00:29:17,315 --> 00:29:20,115
Orange, yellow, red, black.

00:29:20,115 --> 00:29:22,181
Red, black.

00:29:22,181 --> 00:29:24,115
Okay, we've got
less than two minutes!

00:29:24,115 --> 00:29:26,281
I want you to carefully take out
your wire cutters

00:29:26,281 --> 00:29:28,681
and steady the blades
around the plastic coating

00:29:28,681 --> 00:29:30,648
of the red wire!
I repeat,

00:29:30,648 --> 00:29:32,448
the red wire!

00:29:35,015 --> 00:29:37,015
Ticktock...

00:29:37,015 --> 00:29:38,281
ticktock.

00:29:38,281 --> 00:29:41,481
What do you want?
His life.

00:29:41,481 --> 00:29:43,615
He ruined her.

00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:44,515
He took her away from me

00:29:44,515 --> 00:29:47,315
the moment he stopped
Lady Heather from killing

00:29:47,315 --> 00:29:49,681
Wolfowitz.

00:29:49,681 --> 00:29:52,248
I was the first client.

00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:54,515
I was the first man
she slept with

00:29:54,515 --> 00:29:56,281
in the dungeon.

00:29:56,281 --> 00:29:57,815
And then you came along

00:29:57,815 --> 00:30:01,248
and you turned her heart.

00:30:01,248 --> 00:30:04,115
She quit role-playing
because of you.

00:30:04,115 --> 00:30:07,348
She quit her practice
because of you.

00:30:09,215 --> 00:30:12,881
She quit <i>me...</i>

00:30:12,881 --> 00:30:16,048
because of <i>you.</i>

00:30:16,048 --> 00:30:17,948
And now...

00:30:17,948 --> 00:30:22,281
everything Heather and I
once had

00:30:22,281 --> 00:30:24,815
is gone.

00:30:24,815 --> 00:30:28,448
You can't lose something
you never had, Mr. Betton.

00:30:28,448 --> 00:30:31,281
Lady Heather never
slept with you.

00:30:31,281 --> 00:30:35,248
She never slept with any of
her clients or her patients.

00:30:35,248 --> 00:30:38,415
But you've been emotionally
attached to her.

00:30:38,415 --> 00:30:41,115
Haven't you?

00:30:41,115 --> 00:30:44,481
Question now is...

00:30:44,481 --> 00:30:47,548
how attached are you
to that bomb?

00:30:47,548 --> 00:30:49,981
(scoffs)

00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:52,748
All right, listen to
the sound of my voice!

00:30:52,748 --> 00:30:54,248
We snip on "one."

00:30:55,148 --> 00:30:56,615
I love you guys!

00:30:56,615 --> 00:30:57,748
(shuddering sobs)

00:30:57,748 --> 00:30:59,615
Counting down from ten...

00:30:59,615 --> 00:31:01,681
nine... eight...

00:31:01,681 --> 00:31:02,815
seven...
Oh, shoot! Oh...

00:31:02,815 --> 00:31:04,815
six, five...

00:31:04,815 --> 00:31:06,748
Got it?
Yeah.

00:31:06,748 --> 00:31:08,581
Two...

00:31:08,581 --> 00:31:09,648
one!

00:31:12,715 --> 00:31:14,215
Boom.

00:31:14,215 --> 00:31:16,115
Your friends are dead.

00:31:23,148 --> 00:31:24,548
I don't think so.

00:31:26,081 --> 00:31:29,615
You see,
I know about bombs.

00:31:29,615 --> 00:31:32,415
I know about oceans, too.

00:31:32,415 --> 00:31:34,248
There's a great
mammal in the ocean

00:31:34,248 --> 00:31:37,448
known as the
52-hertz whale.

00:31:37,448 --> 00:31:41,648
All year, he practices
his love song for the female.

00:31:41,648 --> 00:31:44,815
Travels thousands
of miles to find her.

00:31:44,815 --> 00:31:48,415
But when he finally gets
the chance to serenade her,

00:31:48,415 --> 00:31:51,515
she doesn't give him
a call back.

00:31:51,515 --> 00:31:53,381
Why?

00:31:53,381 --> 00:31:57,248
His love ballad is sung
at 52 hertz,

00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:59,815
a sonic signature
one note higher

00:31:59,815 --> 00:32:02,181
than the lowest sound of a tuba.

00:32:03,281 --> 00:32:05,681
The average female hears

00:32:05,681 --> 00:32:08,281
at ten to 15 hertz.

00:32:10,148 --> 00:32:12,515
So she never hears his song.

00:32:14,415 --> 00:32:17,481
They call him the lonely whale.

00:32:17,481 --> 00:32:21,015
And year after year,
for a hundred years,

00:32:21,015 --> 00:32:24,148
he works on a new love song

00:32:24,148 --> 00:32:26,681
and never, ever gets
a call back.

00:32:29,148 --> 00:32:31,781
Eventually, he dies off,

00:32:31,781 --> 00:32:34,281
forever alone...

00:32:35,948 --> 00:32:38,081
...heart breaking.

00:32:40,048 --> 00:32:43,048
But you've been
calling out, too.

00:32:43,048 --> 00:32:45,481
You've been calling out
for Lady Heather's love.

00:32:45,481 --> 00:32:46,948
(gasping sob)

00:32:46,948 --> 00:32:49,681
But she's not
calling back, is she?

00:32:52,048 --> 00:32:55,715
And the frightening part,
for you, is...

00:32:55,715 --> 00:32:57,681
she never will.

00:32:57,681 --> 00:32:59,581
(gasping sob)

00:33:06,681 --> 00:33:07,848
Don't.

00:33:07,848 --> 00:33:10,948
You don't have all the power.

00:33:10,948 --> 00:33:13,415
Do you?

00:33:13,415 --> 00:33:16,448
Go ahead.

00:33:16,448 --> 00:33:19,048
Pull it.

00:33:30,048 --> 00:33:31,615
(cries, sniffles)

00:33:34,115 --> 00:33:35,948
(sobs quietly)

00:33:42,715 --> 00:33:45,015
(sobbing deeply)

00:33:46,881 --> 00:33:48,048
It's okay, it's okay.

00:33:48,048 --> 00:33:51,481
We did it. We did it.

00:33:53,715 --> 00:33:55,881
Okay.

00:33:55,881 --> 00:33:58,315
Good team.
Yeah.

00:34:06,415 --> 00:34:08,281
Ah, Jules.

00:34:08,281 --> 00:34:11,715
Wherever I go, you go.

00:34:11,715 --> 00:34:13,015
(knocking on glass)

00:34:13,015 --> 00:34:13,848
Heading out?

00:34:13,848 --> 00:34:16,348
Yeah. Yeah, I'm...

00:34:16,348 --> 00:34:18,848
not one for big good-byes--

00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:22,748
cakes, candles and hullabaloo.

00:34:22,748 --> 00:34:24,848
Well...

00:34:24,848 --> 00:34:26,948
I'm not one
for good-byes, either.

00:34:26,948 --> 00:34:28,648
Which is why I'd like

00:34:28,648 --> 00:34:32,348
to put my hat in the ring
for that director position.

00:34:32,348 --> 00:34:35,848
I mean,
if Sara doesn't take it.

00:34:35,848 --> 00:34:37,381
Really?

00:34:37,381 --> 00:34:39,181
Yeah, I'm coming
back home.

00:34:39,181 --> 00:34:41,048
Vegas is in my blood.

00:34:41,048 --> 00:34:43,315
I have my daughter Lindsey.

00:34:43,315 --> 00:34:46,381
And just... so much of what
my father left behind

00:34:46,381 --> 00:34:48,148
is here.

00:34:48,148 --> 00:34:49,681
Not to mention those
two little girls

00:34:49,681 --> 00:34:51,948
who don't have anyone.

00:34:51,948 --> 00:34:55,415
All reasons to come back
where I belong.

00:34:55,415 --> 00:34:57,348
Home.

00:34:57,348 --> 00:34:59,815
And you are heading
east, yeah?

00:34:59,815 --> 00:35:02,281
Yeah, yeah.
Opportunity knocked.

00:35:02,281 --> 00:35:05,748
Never too late to start
a new chapter, as they say.

00:35:05,748 --> 00:35:08,581
Nice.

00:35:08,581 --> 00:35:09,481
So...

00:35:09,481 --> 00:35:11,048
can I help you
carry anything?

00:35:11,048 --> 00:35:14,181
Uh, no, actually.
I-I got it. Um...

00:35:16,115 --> 00:35:19,148
Everything that's
in my mind and...

00:35:19,148 --> 00:35:22,681
and in my heart
is right here in this box.

00:35:36,748 --> 00:35:37,981
ECKLIE:
Okay, okay,

00:35:37,981 --> 00:35:39,915
one more, one more.

00:35:48,981 --> 00:35:52,015
MAN: This way, Sheriff.
WOMAN: Got enough. Thank you.

00:35:52,015 --> 00:35:54,481
Great, great. Thanks, guys.

00:35:56,081 --> 00:35:57,615
Congratulations, Sara.

00:35:57,615 --> 00:35:59,115
Thanks, Conrad.
Mm.

00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:00,048
Talk to you later.

00:36:00,048 --> 00:36:01,348
MAN: You guys might
like that one better.

00:36:01,348 --> 00:36:03,681
MAN 2: Good work, sir.
MAN 3: Congratulations.

00:36:03,681 --> 00:36:07,015
(chuckles)
Thank you.

00:36:07,015 --> 00:36:09,848
I never thought
I'd see this day coming.

00:36:09,848 --> 00:36:10,881
But with D.B. out...

00:36:10,881 --> 00:36:12,981
You deserve it.

00:36:12,981 --> 00:36:14,981
Vegas is lucky to have you.

00:36:14,981 --> 00:36:17,281
The oceans are lucky
to have you.

00:36:19,848 --> 00:36:22,615
Ironic, isn't it?

00:36:22,615 --> 00:36:23,181
I'm the one that

00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,548
always wanted
to get out of Vegas,

00:36:24,548 --> 00:36:29,048
and you're the one who thought
you would never leave.

00:36:29,048 --> 00:36:30,581
Yeah.

00:36:34,048 --> 00:36:36,115
Well...

00:36:39,648 --> 00:36:43,448
So...

00:36:43,448 --> 00:36:46,281
I hope you find what
you're looking for out there.

00:36:48,981 --> 00:36:51,015
Bye, Gil.

00:37:09,981 --> 00:37:11,948
That's it.

00:37:11,948 --> 00:37:14,148
We're done.

00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:15,915
Thanks for your statement.
The D.A. may

00:37:15,915 --> 00:37:19,248
ask you to testify, but
that's entirely up to you.

00:37:19,248 --> 00:37:21,381
Sure.
Whatever helps.

00:37:24,015 --> 00:37:25,981
Heather...

00:37:25,981 --> 00:37:27,948
(sighs)

00:37:27,948 --> 00:37:31,348
...before I get
back on my boat...

00:37:31,348 --> 00:37:34,148
...I wanted to thank you.

00:37:34,148 --> 00:37:36,615
Thank me for what?

00:37:41,915 --> 00:37:43,915
When we first met, I-I...

00:37:43,915 --> 00:37:48,981
had a shell around my heart.

00:37:48,981 --> 00:37:53,781
I'd lost my belief
in humanity.

00:37:53,781 --> 00:37:55,848
The only truth I...

00:37:55,848 --> 00:37:59,615
I knew was empirical science.

00:37:59,615 --> 00:38:04,081
I-I just wanted
to thank you for...

00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:08,348
...opening my heart.

00:38:08,348 --> 00:38:08,848
Through you,

00:38:08,848 --> 00:38:12,181
I learned to love someone.

00:38:14,548 --> 00:38:16,648
Sara?

00:38:21,148 --> 00:38:26,848
She restores my faith
in the human being.

00:38:26,848 --> 00:38:28,715
Plus...

00:38:28,715 --> 00:38:31,281
...she helped me with
my crossword puzzles.

00:38:34,848 --> 00:38:37,381
She's been my
best friend.

00:38:40,548 --> 00:38:43,815
I'll miss her.

00:38:43,815 --> 00:38:46,548
For the rest of my life.

00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:54,881
LINDSEY:
Hey, Sara,

00:38:54,881 --> 00:38:57,748
front desk asked me
to deliver this.

00:38:57,748 --> 00:38:58,581
It's the videotape

00:38:58,581 --> 00:38:59,881
of Lady Heather's
final interview

00:38:59,881 --> 00:39:01,881
before Grissom released her.

00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:04,815
Oh, great.
(wry laugh)

00:39:04,815 --> 00:39:07,015
Thanks, Lindsey.

00:39:15,481 --> 00:39:19,515
I... watched
the whole interrogation.

00:39:19,515 --> 00:39:22,548
Uh, I learned a lot.

00:39:22,548 --> 00:39:24,681
Especially the end.

00:39:27,148 --> 00:39:29,548
You should watch it.
