00:02:55,372 --> 00:02:57,974

00:02:59,342 --> 00:03:01,009
All right, I'll look

I'll shoot the overalls.

00:03:08,782 --> 00:03:10,917
you're applying

00:03:10,917 --> 00:03:13,886
Oh.
Stage doesn't get
any bigger than this, Sara.

00:03:13,886 --> 00:03:15,355
You want this case?

00:03:16,789 --> 00:03:17,689
Good.

00:03:17,689 --> 00:03:19,291
It's yours.

I know this is gonna
sound insensitive,

00:03:22,927 --> 00:03:25,796
but don't you think a
bomber wearing a vest

00:03:25,796 --> 00:03:28,565
would've taken out
way more people than this?

00:03:28,565 --> 00:03:29,432
Yeah.

00:03:29,432 --> 00:03:32,801
So, what, faulty bomb?

00:03:32,801 --> 00:03:34,636
You put a vest on like
that in a public place,

00:03:34,636 --> 00:03:36,337
I gotta think that
you're planning on taking

00:03:36,337 --> 00:03:39,707
as many people with
you as possible.

00:03:39,707 --> 00:03:41,341
Yeah.

00:03:41,341 --> 00:03:42,676
So, what do you think?

00:03:42,676 --> 00:03:43,877
First blush.

00:03:46,779 --> 00:03:48,381
Terrorism.

00:03:48,381 --> 00:03:50,482
Why do you say that?

00:03:50,482 --> 00:03:52,450
Vegas is terrified.

00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:56,453

two seconds to turn around,

00:04:41,289 --> 00:04:42,957
or I'm gonna
consider you a threat

00:04:42,957 --> 00:04:45,426
and shoot you right here
on this boat.

00:04:46,727 --> 00:04:49,162
(sighs)

00:04:49,162 --> 00:04:51,864
Shark fins.

jumped a shark.

Three.
A lot are injured.

00:05:11,346 --> 00:05:13,148
We don't have a count.

00:05:13,148 --> 00:05:14,149
Anyway, she's one of ours.

00:05:14,149 --> 00:05:16,050
Her name is Romina Gonzalez.

00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,251
I saw the surveillance video.

00:05:17,251 --> 00:05:18,485
You want to talk to her now.

00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:21,020
She was the last person
to speak to the bomber

00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,388
before he self-detonated.

00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:23,956
Romina,
hang in there, honey.

00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:24,857
WILLOWS:
Mrs. Gonzalez,

00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:27,159
I'm Catherine Willows,
Special Agent with the FBI.

00:05:27,159 --> 00:05:28,460
(groans in pain)

00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,862
I wasn't even supposed
to work today.

00:05:30,862 --> 00:05:32,529
I just needed the money.

00:05:32,529 --> 00:05:34,498
I just need to ask...

00:05:34,498 --> 00:05:36,132
could you recall
your conversation you had

00:05:36,132 --> 00:05:38,501
with the bomber?

00:05:45,373 --> 00:05:47,075
BOMBER:
Are those your kids?

00:05:47,075 --> 00:05:48,142
Ah, yeah.

00:05:48,142 --> 00:05:50,177
Those are my babies.
Oh, cute.

00:05:50,177 --> 00:05:51,878
Cubano cigars--

00:05:51,878 --> 00:05:53,613
50 bucks a stick, right?

00:05:56,949 --> 00:05:58,717
Could you come with me
to the cage?

00:05:58,717 --> 00:06:02,320
I just need to cash
in a few chips first.

00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,154
Sure.

00:06:04,154 --> 00:06:05,755
So, he was listening to someone

00:06:05,755 --> 00:06:07,391
on the other end
of an earpiece?

00:06:07,391 --> 00:06:08,358
FIREMAN: All right,
check the fentanyl?

00:06:08,358 --> 00:06:10,193
(gasps, groans)
FIREMAN 2: Yeah.

00:06:10,193 --> 00:06:12,361
FIREMAN: Tourniquet
still in place?
FIREMAN 2: It is.

00:06:12,361 --> 00:06:15,697
My daughters' names...

00:06:15,697 --> 00:06:19,500
are Helena and Maria.

00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,535
All right.

00:06:21,535 --> 00:06:23,103

00:06:24,004 --> 00:06:25,305
FIREMAN 2: Doctor, we need
some help over here.

00:06:25,305 --> 00:06:26,539
Romina?

00:06:26,539 --> 00:06:28,273
Ma'am, please step back.

00:06:28,273 --> 00:06:29,774
Start compressions.

00:06:29,774 --> 00:06:32,877
Go ahead to the hospital,
prepare for arrival.

00:06:32,877 --> 00:06:34,578
DOCTOR:
Let's start a line.

00:06:55,495 --> 00:06:56,863
FBI Special Agent Willows.

00:06:56,863 --> 00:06:58,264
I've been authorized
by the L.A. Bureau

00:06:58,264 --> 00:06:59,965
to take over
this bomb sight.

00:07:03,101 --> 00:07:05,603
Sara!
Catherine, hey.

00:07:05,603 --> 00:07:06,971
I am so sorry.
Hey.

00:07:06,971 --> 00:07:08,005
What a mess.

00:07:08,005 --> 00:07:10,106
Just got in from L.A.
I saw the footage on the news.

00:07:10,106 --> 00:07:12,108
How can I help?

00:07:12,108 --> 00:07:14,077
Well, I'm not exactly sure.

00:07:14,077 --> 00:07:15,745
It's a conflict of interest.

00:07:15,745 --> 00:07:17,379
Legally, I'm the owner
of the Eclipse.

00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:19,614
This building and everything
in it is my responsibility.

00:07:19,614 --> 00:07:21,149
Of course, yes.
Yes, it is.

00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:25,486
But... you and I both know
you can't be in here.

00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:27,120
Three of my employees are dead.

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,255
What am I supposed to do?

00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,990
Wait in the
hospitality suite?

00:07:33,492 --> 00:07:35,594
Look, Sara...

00:07:35,594 --> 00:07:36,828
I'm not here to cause trouble,

00:07:36,828 --> 00:07:39,530
but I'm also not here
to sit on the sidelines.

00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:40,731
And as long as
there are bodies

00:07:40,731 --> 00:07:42,632
on the floor of
my father's casino,

00:07:42,632 --> 00:07:45,068
I need to continue
to work this case.

00:07:45,068 --> 00:07:47,036
Okay?

00:07:47,036 --> 00:07:48,604
Okay.

00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:54,609
I ran your name.

00:07:54,609 --> 00:07:57,844
Says you used to run
the Las Vegas Crime Lab.

00:07:57,844 --> 00:07:59,980
Long time ago.
Do you mind telling me

00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,715
why you're unlawfully
on this vessel?

00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:05,851
Well, see, that's
my boat over there.

00:08:05,851 --> 00:08:08,720
The poacher who owns
this boat has violated

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,789
Fish and Game Code 8599,
which states:

00:08:11,789 --> 00:08:14,491
"It is unlawful to
slice the dorsal fin

00:08:14,491 --> 00:08:16,593
"off a <i>Carcharodon</i>
<i>Carcharias</i>

00:08:16,593 --> 00:08:18,795
unless you bring the
whole carcass ashore."

00:08:18,795 --> 00:08:20,997
But white sharks
can only be taken

00:08:20,997 --> 00:08:25,266
for scientific or educational
purposes under permit.

00:08:25,266 --> 00:08:27,835
This boat has no permit.

00:08:27,835 --> 00:08:30,437
My job is to confiscate
the evidence,

00:08:30,437 --> 00:08:32,406
document it and prepare it

00:08:32,406 --> 00:08:36,475
for international
and/or domestic court.

00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:38,711
I had to ask.

00:08:38,711 --> 00:08:42,847
So, now you're what,
a CSI at sea?

00:08:42,847 --> 00:08:44,615
Kind of.

00:08:44,615 --> 00:08:47,083
Shark fin soup is bad.

00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:49,785
It's worth getting
arrested for.

00:08:57,558 --> 00:08:59,093
(Willows scoffs)

00:08:59,093 --> 00:09:02,329
Bastard lied about needing
to get money from the cage.

00:09:02,329 --> 00:09:06,332
He lured Romina over after
he found out she had children.

00:09:06,332 --> 00:09:07,934
BRASS:
Pretty cruel.

00:09:10,936 --> 00:09:12,603
Whew.

00:09:16,506 --> 00:09:17,641
I'm good here.

00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:19,509
Just release
everything back to Sara.

00:09:19,509 --> 00:09:20,343
As far as this
piece of work--

00:09:20,343 --> 00:09:23,212
just grab his photo and run
it through NCIC, BICTOF,

00:09:23,212 --> 00:09:25,748
local DMV-- I want a name.

00:09:27,182 --> 00:09:29,584
Would you have assumed
this if I was a nun

00:09:29,584 --> 00:09:31,052
or a Hasidic Jew?

00:09:31,052 --> 00:09:33,787
They also cover themselves
based on religious belief.

00:09:33,787 --> 00:09:37,190
Considering what your husband
did, Mrs. Karmimi, I would.

00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:38,424
Hijab or no hijab,

00:09:38,424 --> 00:09:40,459
terrorism is not a stretch

00:09:40,459 --> 00:09:42,694
if you're on my side
of the law.

00:09:42,694 --> 00:09:44,596
My husband converted to Islam

00:09:44,596 --> 00:09:47,598
because we fell in
love, Mrs. Sidle.

00:09:47,598 --> 00:09:49,399
I came to America

00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:51,934
so that I could live
free as a woman.

00:09:51,934 --> 00:09:56,038
Here, women have a chance
to live and to love

00:09:56,038 --> 00:09:59,107
without being
stoned to death.

00:10:01,742 --> 00:10:04,779
To you, he's a criminal.

00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:09,315
But to me, he was a husband.

00:10:09,315 --> 00:10:12,185
He was my salvation.

00:10:16,088 --> 00:10:18,022
Sorry.

00:10:18,022 --> 00:10:22,293
Um, I-I didn't mean
to offend you.

00:10:22,293 --> 00:10:25,228
I'm sorry for your loss.

00:10:25,228 --> 00:10:27,963
That does not forgive what
he did to those people.

00:10:27,963 --> 00:10:29,798
I know.

00:10:29,798 --> 00:10:32,133
Mrs. Karmimi, help me.

00:10:32,133 --> 00:10:34,635
If not terrorism...

00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:35,703
then why would your husband

00:10:35,703 --> 00:10:38,671
strap a bomb to his body
and do that?

00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:40,907
I don't know.

00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:43,509
My husband is not a terrorist.

00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:49,480
If anything, he had
a gambling problem.

00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:53,283
I took him to our Imam to
speak to him at the mosque.

00:10:53,283 --> 00:10:55,585
I even took him to therapy.

00:10:55,585 --> 00:10:57,854
Therapy for his addiction?

00:10:57,854 --> 00:10:58,721
Yes.

00:10:58,721 --> 00:11:02,024
He was doing well
for a while.

00:11:02,024 --> 00:11:05,493
But then,
the therapist of his,

00:11:05,493 --> 00:11:08,762
she unexpectedly
quit her practice.

00:11:08,762 --> 00:11:11,832
And then he
just spiraled.

00:11:33,515 --> 00:11:36,317
What the hell is that?

00:11:37,785 --> 00:11:41,521
Hey, you garbage men find
anything gold and square,

00:11:41,521 --> 00:11:42,389
about yea big?

00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:46,292
Something gold and metal flew
out of the bomber's vest.

00:11:46,292 --> 00:11:48,193
Chest-high, right side?

00:11:48,193 --> 00:11:48,794
Yeah.

00:11:48,794 --> 00:11:51,629
Why?
Uh...

00:11:51,629 --> 00:11:54,231
I noticed this
hand-stitched lining

00:11:54,231 --> 00:11:56,967
on the inside of
the bomber's vest,

00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:59,169
almost like
a homemade pocket.

00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:02,238
Gold metal piece.

00:12:02,238 --> 00:12:06,441
I found it earlier,
but I wasn't sure what it was.

00:12:06,441 --> 00:12:08,510
This flew out of the bomber's
right breast pocket,

00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:11,945
but this vest doesn't
even have inside pockets.

00:12:11,945 --> 00:12:13,881
Looks like this gold
God-knows-what

00:12:13,881 --> 00:12:16,083
was purposely sewn
into the vest.

00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:17,350
Good catch.

00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:21,320
Now, there's some kind
of etching on it.

00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,288
Maybe I can lift it.

00:13:16,831 --> 00:13:19,233
Forgive me,
but who is Lady Heather?

00:13:19,233 --> 00:13:22,301
Uh, she's a sex therapist
Grissom had a thing with

00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,802
back in the day-day.

00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:25,638
Not, like, a sexual one,

00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,440
more like...
an intellectual one.

00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,208
Anyway, he worked a
couple cases with her.

00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:33,344
And against her.

00:13:33,344 --> 00:13:34,210
So what do we think?

00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:36,679
That she could be involved
in this somehow?

00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:38,581
We don't know,
but we'd like to find out

00:13:38,581 --> 00:13:41,716
why this piece of metal with
Lady Heather's initials on it

00:13:41,716 --> 00:13:44,218
flew from the
bomber's jacket.

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,789
ECKLIE:
Sara.

00:13:48,789 --> 00:13:50,758
Wait.

00:13:50,758 --> 00:13:52,125
This is gonna sound
like an odd request,

00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:54,293
but do you know
where Grissom is?

00:13:54,293 --> 00:13:55,027
Grissom?
Yeah.

00:13:55,027 --> 00:13:57,263
Uh, let me see, grab a globe,

00:13:57,263 --> 00:13:59,597
spin it, look for the blue,
and pick an ocean.

00:13:59,597 --> 00:14:00,431
He could be anywhere.

00:14:00,431 --> 00:14:01,999
Why?
We think Lady Heather

00:14:01,999 --> 00:14:03,868
might have something
to do with the bombing.

00:14:03,868 --> 00:14:05,970
Lady Heather?

00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,171
Well, even if she did,

00:14:08,171 --> 00:14:10,506
what does that have to do
with my ex-husband?

00:14:10,506 --> 00:14:12,308
Lady Heather is
in the wind, all right?

00:14:12,308 --> 00:14:15,310
We're getting a warrant
for her house, as we speak.

00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:17,244
Come on, if anybody knows
this woman inside and out,

00:14:17,244 --> 00:14:20,114
it's Grissom; I figured he could
provide some deeper insight.

00:14:20,114 --> 00:14:21,248
Conrad, with all due respect,

00:14:21,248 --> 00:14:23,316
this entire building
is working the bombing case.

00:14:23,316 --> 00:14:24,684
Greg and I have history
with Lady Heather.

00:14:24,684 --> 00:14:25,651
We-we got it covered.

00:14:25,651 --> 00:14:28,888
I know, Sara, but this bombing
is international news now.

00:14:28,888 --> 00:14:31,723
I'd feel better if we
exhaust all resources.

00:14:31,723 --> 00:14:34,625
Do you at least
have his cell?

00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,394
(scoffs, chuckles)

00:14:41,931 --> 00:14:43,900
(cell phone rings)

00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,135
(phone ringing, buzzing)

00:14:56,476 --> 00:14:57,911
GRISSOM: <i>Well, if that's</i>
<i>the case, Conrad,</i>

00:14:57,911 --> 00:15:00,012
then I need to come up there.

00:15:00,012 --> 00:15:02,747
But you're gonna have
to get me out of this first.

00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:08,385
Hello.

00:15:08,385 --> 00:15:10,020
Let him go?

00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:12,788
Are you sure
about this, Sheriff?

00:15:12,788 --> 00:15:13,923
Okay.

00:15:13,923 --> 00:15:15,324
I'll arrange transport

00:15:15,324 --> 00:15:18,227
and relinquish him
into your custody.

00:15:18,227 --> 00:15:19,060
(sighs heavily)

00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,595
It's your lucky day, pal.

00:15:20,595 --> 00:15:21,763
I'd tell you
not to leave town,

00:15:21,763 --> 00:15:25,498
but I guess you're
going to Sin City.

Oh, my God.

00:16:39,557 --> 00:16:41,393
Hi. Welcome back.

00:16:41,393 --> 00:16:43,427
It's been a long time
since I saw you last.

00:16:43,427 --> 00:16:46,430
Oh, but, hey, check it out--
CSI Level One.

00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:47,197
I did it. (chuckles)

00:16:47,197 --> 00:16:48,431
You know what
the crazy thing is?

00:16:48,431 --> 00:16:50,933
(whispering):
It's my first day.

00:16:50,933 --> 00:16:51,501
Do you want to take my blood

00:16:51,501 --> 00:16:54,069
or offer me a chocolate-covered
grasshopper?

00:16:54,069 --> 00:16:56,004
Oh, but, uh, anyway,
I gotta run.

00:16:56,004 --> 00:16:58,472
It was great
to see you, as always.

00:16:58,472 --> 00:16:59,473
See ya.

00:17:06,813 --> 00:17:08,547
Sara.

00:17:08,547 --> 00:17:09,881
Gil.

00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:14,419
I'm back.
(chuckles)

00:17:14,419 --> 00:17:16,921
I see that.

00:17:16,921 --> 00:17:19,222
ECKLIE:
Grissom.

00:17:19,222 --> 00:17:20,423
Hey.

00:17:20,423 --> 00:17:22,125
Thanks for coming.

00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:25,027
Uh, let's step
in D.B.'s office. Sara.

00:17:25,027 --> 00:17:27,462
(whispers):
Who's D.B.?

00:17:27,462 --> 00:17:30,131
D.B., Grissom.

00:17:30,131 --> 00:17:32,866
Hi. I'm-I'm
Diebenkorn Russell.

00:17:32,866 --> 00:17:34,835
Pleasure to finally
meet you, Gil.

00:17:36,202 --> 00:17:38,371
My brains used to
sit on that shelf.

00:17:38,371 --> 00:17:40,840
Yeah, I, uh, traded
brains for mushrooms.

00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,207
Hope you don't mind.

00:17:42,207 --> 00:17:43,775
ECKLIE: Gil, we could
really use some insight

00:17:43,775 --> 00:17:45,109
on Lady Heather.

00:17:45,109 --> 00:17:47,711
The most pressing
issue is this.

00:17:47,711 --> 00:17:50,313
At the blast site, we found
a piece of gold metal

00:17:50,313 --> 00:17:53,215
with the letters LHK
inscribed on it.

00:17:53,215 --> 00:17:56,318
It flew out of
the bomber's suicide vest.

00:17:56,318 --> 00:17:58,654
Well, that's her logo,
but I don't know what this is.

00:17:58,654 --> 00:18:02,223
ECKLIE: When was the last
time you spoke with her?

00:18:02,223 --> 00:18:04,424
A few days ago, by phone.

00:18:04,424 --> 00:18:07,627
Guess your cell service is
better than it used to be.

00:18:07,627 --> 00:18:09,128
Who wants to catch me up?

00:18:09,128 --> 00:18:10,863
Gil!
GRISSOM: Hey.

00:18:10,863 --> 00:18:12,898
I heard you were coming by.

00:18:12,898 --> 00:18:14,299
RUSSELL:
Catherine...

00:18:14,299 --> 00:18:16,501
because your name is
on the deed to the Eclipse,

00:18:16,501 --> 00:18:19,603
it might be cleaner if you work
other avenues for us, okay?

00:18:19,603 --> 00:18:20,504
Sure.

00:18:20,504 --> 00:18:22,305
I'll work up
a chronological timeline

00:18:22,305 --> 00:18:25,008
and psychological profile
on Lady Heather.

00:18:25,008 --> 00:18:26,742
Good luck with that.

00:18:26,742 --> 00:18:28,277
ECKLIE:
Sara, your warrant came in.

00:18:28,277 --> 00:18:29,978
Lady Heather's house
is all yours.

00:18:29,978 --> 00:18:31,079
Perfect.

00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:32,547
Grissom and I'll
check it out.

00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,027
Wow, 30 minutes in
the car, no words.

00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:52,897
If you were playing that silent
car game, you definitely win.

00:18:54,631 --> 00:18:57,533
I thought we were talking.

00:18:57,533 --> 00:18:59,835
All right, uh, listen,
you know, before we go in there

00:18:59,835 --> 00:19:03,405
and deal with Lady Heather,
I-I just want to acknowledge

00:19:03,405 --> 00:19:05,940
that you and I haven't
spoken much since the divorce,

00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,074
or before it, for that matter.

00:19:07,074 --> 00:19:08,442
We both went our separate ways.

00:19:08,442 --> 00:19:09,976
You're doing your
Jacques Cousteau thing,

00:19:09,976 --> 00:19:11,677
I'm in the field.

00:19:11,677 --> 00:19:13,079
Things end, I-I get it.

00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:15,247
But-but you and I
are professionals,

00:19:15,247 --> 00:19:16,615
and as professionals,

00:19:16,615 --> 00:19:19,050
I think it's in the best
interests of the case

00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:21,019
if we put on a unified front.

00:19:21,019 --> 00:19:23,354
You know, work as a team.

00:19:23,354 --> 00:19:26,056
So, uh, let's put on
our game faces

00:19:26,056 --> 00:19:28,391
and-and keep it professional.

00:19:28,391 --> 00:19:31,460
See? Mine's on.

00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,928
You ready to go in?

00:19:35,063 --> 00:19:38,165
Seeing you again left me
a little speechless.

00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,302
Come on.

00:19:54,746 --> 00:19:56,980
Dr. Kessler?

00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:59,015
Las Vegas Crime Lab.

00:20:21,233 --> 00:20:23,501
WILLOWS:
From 2000 to 2006,

00:20:23,501 --> 00:20:27,838
Lady Heather ran a role-playing
Red Room out of her home.

00:20:27,838 --> 00:20:32,809
Whips, chains, pig masks,
the whole ball of sex wax.

00:20:32,809 --> 00:20:35,378
SANDERS: In 2006,
she shut down the Red Room

00:20:35,378 --> 00:20:38,313
after her daughter
Zoe was murdered.

00:20:38,313 --> 00:20:41,382
Overnight, her Red Room clients
became therapy patients

00:20:41,382 --> 00:20:43,985
where she started her
own psychiatry practice.

00:20:43,985 --> 00:20:45,252
And three months ago,

00:20:45,252 --> 00:20:47,387
she abruptly shut down
her practice.

00:20:47,387 --> 00:20:48,821
Why?

00:20:48,821 --> 00:20:50,356
Well, here's a thought:

00:20:50,356 --> 00:20:52,792
This year, Lady Heather's
granddaughter Alison,

00:20:52,792 --> 00:20:54,226
daughter of Zoe,

00:20:54,226 --> 00:20:56,761
was hit by a car
while walking to school.

00:20:56,761 --> 00:20:58,162
She died three months ago,

00:20:58,162 --> 00:21:00,263
right around the time
she quit her practice.

00:21:00,263 --> 00:21:02,232
SANDERS: You think the two
incidents are related?

00:21:02,232 --> 00:21:03,766
I don't know yet.

00:21:03,766 --> 00:21:05,034
(sighs)

00:21:05,034 --> 00:21:06,302
Lady Heather told me something

00:21:06,302 --> 00:21:10,105
a long time ago,
that I never forgot.

00:21:10,105 --> 00:21:11,773
She told me that
there are many things

00:21:11,773 --> 00:21:12,973
that you can give a man--

00:21:12,973 --> 00:21:14,942
your body, your time,

00:21:14,942 --> 00:21:16,476
even your heart--

00:21:16,476 --> 00:21:18,345
but that one thing that
you could never, ever,

00:21:18,345 --> 00:21:21,848
ever let go of is your power.

00:21:21,848 --> 00:21:24,316
I think that she lost everything
that mattered to her--

00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:25,517
her daughter and
her granddaughter?

00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:28,420
I mean, it's painful enough
to lose one child, but two?

00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,654
I mean, what else does
she have to live for

00:21:29,654 --> 00:21:32,723
but to wield
her power of revenge?

00:21:32,723 --> 00:21:34,290
Not to mention,
we're dealing with

00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:36,359
a master of the human mind.

00:21:59,544 --> 00:22:03,047
Just put my pole in the water

00:22:03,047 --> 00:22:04,849

This is her classroom.

00:35:30,019 --> 00:35:32,921
According to him,
she'd been put on
administrative leave twice,

00:35:32,921 --> 00:35:33,955
for mental instability.

00:35:33,955 --> 00:35:36,757
The school district
paid for a therapist.

00:35:36,757 --> 00:35:39,626
You'll never
guess the name.

00:35:39,626 --> 00:35:42,396
Dr. Kessler.

00:35:49,367 --> 00:35:51,102
What kind of a person
straps a bomb to her chest

00:35:51,102 --> 00:35:52,169
and self-detonates it

00:35:52,169 --> 00:35:54,171
at a school?

00:36:00,143 --> 00:36:02,211
Perhaps someone
under the influence

00:36:02,211 --> 00:36:04,179
of Devil's Breath.

00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:07,916
Burundanga.

00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:09,950
The most dangerous drug
in the world.

00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:12,552
It's a flower that grows rampant
in South America.

00:36:12,552 --> 00:36:15,788
One whiff of its airborne
pollen, and the recipient

00:36:15,788 --> 00:36:17,857
relinquishes all control.

00:36:17,857 --> 00:36:20,192
They'll do anything
on command

00:36:20,192 --> 00:36:22,828
from emptying their bank
accounts for strangers

00:36:22,828 --> 00:36:26,764
to putting on a suicide vest.

00:36:28,065 --> 00:36:30,734
I found these on
the teacher's desk.

00:36:30,734 --> 00:36:33,336
My theory is that
who's behind the bombings

00:36:33,336 --> 00:36:34,903
gave her these flowers
right before

00:36:34,903 --> 00:36:37,439
she went into that school play.

00:36:37,439 --> 00:36:38,906
Wow... (laughs)

00:36:38,906 --> 00:36:40,642
Thank you.

00:36:40,642 --> 00:36:42,709
Um, that's so sweet.

00:36:42,709 --> 00:36:45,479

00:36:45,479 --> 00:36:47,780

GRISSOM: <i>Neurologically,</i>
<i>the drug is so potent,</i>

00:36:54,553 --> 00:36:55,553
<i>it literally turned off</i>

00:36:55,553 --> 00:36:57,855
<i>the judgment receptors</i>

<i>without processing</i>
<i>the consequences.</i>

00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,195
So, did the first bomber,
the male from the casino,

00:37:06,195 --> 00:37:07,963
have Devil's Breath
in his system?

00:37:07,963 --> 00:37:09,565
According to tox, no.

00:37:09,565 --> 00:37:10,899
BRASS:
Well, I don't think
the male bomber

00:37:10,899 --> 00:37:12,600
needed any extra flower power.

00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,302
He was already pissed off at the
casino for losing all his money.

00:37:15,302 --> 00:37:17,671
SANDERS:
So, what are the connections

00:37:17,671 --> 00:37:19,138
between the two bombers?

00:37:19,138 --> 00:37:21,040
Both were patients
of Lady Heather.

00:37:22,375 --> 00:37:24,710
WILLOWS: Is she
the co-conspirator

00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:26,744
in all this,
or the mastermind?

00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:29,046
I think she's being framed.

00:37:32,015 --> 00:37:34,350
SIDLE:
Uh, Grissom has this theory that

00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:36,319
Lady Heather's being framed even
though he doesn't have a motive

00:37:36,319 --> 00:37:38,954

to validate her innocence,
