00:00:24,959 --> 00:00:25,961
Oh...

00:00:25,961 --> 00:00:28,421
Honey here, take this. 

00:00:36,741 --> 00:00:38,075
Not again.

00:00:38,142 --> 00:00:39,911
We are buying
that alarm system.

00:00:39,977 --> 00:00:41,813
No argument from me.
I'm serious.

00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,419
They got the cash.

00:00:48,486 --> 00:00:49,954
Why did they have
to make such a mess?

00:00:50,021 --> 00:00:51,589
Oh, my God...

00:00:51,656 --> 00:00:52,924
What? What's wrong?

00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:54,559
Call 911.

00:01:36,033 --> 00:01:37,502
Introductions?

00:01:37,568 --> 00:01:38,836
Joseph Felton, 44

00:01:38,903 --> 00:01:41,706
not an employee;
no reason to be here.

00:01:41,772 --> 00:01:43,074
Mind if he and I
have a moment?

00:01:43,141 --> 00:01:44,142
No.

00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:20,645
Burn marks?

00:02:20,711 --> 00:02:23,581
Unusual way
to penetrate a safe.

00:02:23,648 --> 00:02:24,649
Hmm...

00:02:24,715 --> 00:02:25,750
How much was taken?

00:02:25,817 --> 00:02:27,718
Three hundred and something,
small bills.

00:02:27,785 --> 00:02:30,688
GRISSOM:
Multiple contusions
to the back of the skull.

00:02:30,755 --> 00:02:32,557
Might've been taken by surprise.

00:02:32,623 --> 00:02:34,725
Robbery interruptus?

00:02:34,792 --> 00:02:37,762
Yeah, I think our robbery
suspect is a homicide victim.

00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:39,864
One way to beat the rap.

DR. ROBBINS:
This is an easy one.


00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:16,896
Three hits to the head.


00:03:16,962 --> 00:03:18,597
Trauma to the brain stem
was fatal.


00:03:18,664 --> 00:03:20,566
Death was instantaneous.


00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:22,434
Can you tell us
about the murder weapon?


00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,334
Nothing definitive


00:03:24,401 --> 00:03:27,237
but I swabbed the points
of impact.


00:03:27,304 --> 00:03:29,573
Slide's under
the microscope.


00:03:33,177 --> 00:03:36,647
STOKES:
Yellow looks like transfer
from the murder weapon


00:03:36,713 --> 00:03:38,248
but what's with the glitter?


00:03:38,315 --> 00:03:39,917
ROBBINS:
Unidentified mineral.


00:03:39,983 --> 00:03:42,820
I sent a sample to Trace
for analysis.


00:03:42,886 --> 00:03:44,521
Hey, Doc, you have a comb?


00:03:46,223 --> 00:03:48,425
Your hair looks great, Cath.


00:03:48,492 --> 00:03:49,693
Gee, thanks, Nick.


00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,028
Guy's still dirty.


00:03:51,095 --> 00:03:53,597
They don't get a bath
till evidence is collected.


00:03:53,664 --> 00:03:54,732
That's what I'm doing


00:03:54,798 --> 00:03:56,700
although I don't think
this is dirt.


00:04:02,806 --> 00:04:04,908
He's covered in spores.


00:04:09,413 --> 00:04:11,615
I think these are from a fern.


00:04:11,682 --> 00:04:14,284
Well, the back entrance
was overgrown with them.


00:04:21,892 --> 00:04:25,529
A fern plant deposits billions
of spores in its lifetime.


00:04:25,596 --> 00:04:27,464
Most are just dust in the wind.


00:04:27,531 --> 00:04:28,465
In our case


00:04:28,532 --> 00:04:29,800
they're evidence.


00:04:29,867 --> 00:04:32,403
As good as fingerprints
or fibers


00:04:32,469 --> 00:04:35,506
in placing a suspect
at a crime scene.


00:04:37,241 --> 00:04:40,844
Hey, you forget
about the coroner?


00:04:40,911 --> 00:04:42,346
Melissa Marlowe.


00:04:42,413 --> 00:04:44,581
Excuse me?


00:04:44,648 --> 00:04:46,917
You lifted 38 prints
from the pottery store.


00:04:46,984 --> 00:04:48,385
I scanned them
through AFIS.


00:04:48,452 --> 00:04:49,987
One came back.


00:04:50,053 --> 00:04:51,088
Melissa Marlowe.


00:04:51,155 --> 00:04:53,056
Why do I know
that name?


00:04:53,123 --> 00:04:54,425
Kidnapping


00:04:54,491 --> 00:04:58,295
Arizona,
21 years ago...


00:04:58,362 --> 00:05:00,264
the little girl.


00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:03,500
Oh, that Melissa Marlowe.


00:05:03,567 --> 00:05:05,569
Wasn't she presumed dead?


00:05:05,636 --> 00:05:07,905
Well, not anymore.


00:05:07,971 --> 00:05:09,339
On the left


00:05:09,406 --> 00:05:11,008
is Melissa Marlowe's print,
age four--


00:05:11,075 --> 00:05:12,676
preschool fingerprinting
initiative.


00:05:12,743 --> 00:05:14,511
On the right is a print
that you lifted.


00:05:14,578 --> 00:05:16,080
I don't see a match.


00:05:16,146 --> 00:05:17,081
Neither did I


00:05:17,147 --> 00:05:18,649
but since fingerprints
are set for life


00:05:18,715 --> 00:05:20,484
during the fourth month
of fetal development


00:05:20,551 --> 00:05:22,453
I looked beyond
the size differential.


00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:26,256
Now, both prints
are ulnar loops.


00:05:26,323 --> 00:05:31,128
Bifurcation, recurve
and ridge endings
are identical.


00:05:32,129 --> 00:05:34,398
I've aligned the prints
along the delta.


00:05:38,802 --> 00:05:41,839
WILLOWS:
You've got a
perfect match.


00:05:41,905 --> 00:05:46,276
Wait... is she a suspect
in the homicide?


00:05:46,343 --> 00:05:48,045
No, her print wasn't fresh.


00:05:48,112 --> 00:05:49,446
There was dust on it.


00:05:49,513 --> 00:05:51,548
Has to be
a few weeks old.


00:05:51,615 --> 00:05:53,650
I think
we have two separate cases.


00:05:53,717 --> 00:05:55,853
So I'm going to
take the new lead


00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,488
in the old kidnapping case.


00:05:57,554 --> 00:05:59,022
Nick and I will cover
the homicide.


00:06:07,731 --> 00:06:10,434
SIDLE:
Nadine Winston falls
asleep in that chair


00:06:10,501 --> 00:06:12,002
and incinerates.


00:06:12,069 --> 00:06:13,470
We could make history.


00:06:13,537 --> 00:06:15,806
Come on, now. Don't tell me
you believe in that BS.


00:06:15,873 --> 00:06:17,107
No, of course not.


00:06:18,776 --> 00:06:21,178
I'm a scientist. I just...


00:06:21,245 --> 00:06:23,881
She has been reduced
to ashes.


00:06:27,451 --> 00:06:30,687
Spontaneous human combustion
is science fiction.


00:06:30,754 --> 00:06:31,822
I know.


00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:33,891
There's no such thing
as a human torch.


00:06:35,559 --> 00:06:38,028
What if it is real
and we've uncovered it?


00:06:38,095 --> 00:06:39,763
Sara, this is a crime scene.


00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,265
Stay with me here, okay?


00:06:41,331 --> 00:06:43,167
Don't lose it.


00:06:43,233 --> 00:06:45,769
I'm not.


00:06:45,836 --> 00:06:48,705
I'm just open to all theories.


00:06:49,773 --> 00:06:50,808
What's that?


00:06:52,509 --> 00:06:57,881
Looks like cotton fiber...
possibly from a nightgown.


00:06:57,948 --> 00:07:00,384
It's barely
scorched.


00:07:00,451 --> 00:07:02,719
Weird.


00:07:02,786 --> 00:07:05,989
It's like the body burned,
but...


00:07:06,056 --> 00:07:09,093
the clothing
was fire retardant.


00:07:13,864 --> 00:07:15,466
BROWN:
Wow.


00:07:15,532 --> 00:07:16,867
Check that out.


00:07:20,871 --> 00:07:23,474
Fire practically burned
a hole in the roof


00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,375
but it's isolated
in one spot.


00:07:25,442 --> 00:07:28,312
It's like the fire
created a chimney for itself.


00:07:28,378 --> 00:07:29,313
The victim


00:07:29,379 --> 00:07:30,380
she live alone?


00:07:30,447 --> 00:07:32,382
Husband's already
at the station.


00:07:32,449 --> 00:07:37,087
Look, I am telling you,
I have no idea what
happened to my wife.


00:07:37,154 --> 00:07:39,757
Were you having
marital problems?


00:07:39,823 --> 00:07:41,325
No.


00:07:41,391 --> 00:07:45,095
We were like newlyweds.


00:07:45,162 --> 00:07:48,399
INVESTIGATOR:
If I understand
you correctly

00:07:48,465 --> 00:07:49,867
you went to bed.

00:07:49,933 --> 00:07:53,303
Nadine fell asleep
in the easy chair.

00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:56,840
Ten hours later you woke up,
walked into the living room

00:07:56,907 --> 00:07:58,842
and she was a pile of ash.

00:07:58,909 --> 00:08:00,444
A human torch.

00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,745
Yeah, right.

00:08:01,812 --> 00:08:04,181
You say you were like newlyweds?

00:08:04,248 --> 00:08:05,983
Yeah.

00:08:06,049 --> 00:08:08,152
But the two of you weren't
sleeping in the same bed.

00:08:08,218 --> 00:08:09,953
Good question.

00:08:12,055 --> 00:08:13,357
She snored.

00:08:13,424 --> 00:08:14,958
It was a problem.

00:08:17,361 --> 00:08:19,129
A small one.

00:08:19,196 --> 00:08:23,100
Mr. Winston...

00:08:23,167 --> 00:08:25,102
do you know how to use
a blowtorch?

00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:27,371
Another good question.

00:08:27,438 --> 00:08:29,640
Look, I came down to
this station on my own.

00:08:29,706 --> 00:08:32,743
If I can be helpful,
let me know!

00:08:35,579 --> 00:08:37,548
( <i>door slamming</i> )

00:08:37,614 --> 00:08:40,050
So you still think
it's spontaneous combustion?

00:08:40,117 --> 00:08:43,687
Theories give way to conclusions
once all the evidence is in.

00:08:43,754 --> 00:08:46,790
I am merely thinking about
the next piece of evidence.

00:08:46,857 --> 00:08:48,325
Yeah.

00:08:48,392 --> 00:08:51,428
Hey, Nicky,
you paged me?

00:08:51,495 --> 00:08:53,063
Yeah. Yeah, Jim, hi.

00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:55,132
I took these photos

00:08:55,199 --> 00:08:56,500
at the crime scene.

00:08:56,567 --> 00:08:57,701
Safe was cracked

00:08:57,768 --> 00:08:59,036
with a plasma lance.

00:08:59,103 --> 00:09:01,205
Okay, I'll bite.

00:09:01,271 --> 00:09:03,107
It's a high-powered
electric blaster.

00:09:03,173 --> 00:09:04,975
It could cut through
that hard plate

00:09:05,042 --> 00:09:06,210
with extreme
precision.

00:09:06,276 --> 00:09:08,579
It's not common, but effective.

00:09:08,645 --> 00:09:10,814
Crime scene photo from
a robbery case in '99.

00:09:10,881 --> 00:09:12,182
Joseph Felton

00:09:12,249 --> 00:09:14,852
our dead guy,
was arrested

00:09:14,918 --> 00:09:16,587
but granted immunity in exchange

00:09:16,653 --> 00:09:19,356
for his testimony against his
partner, Darin Hanson

00:09:19,423 --> 00:09:21,525
who used
a plasma lance

00:09:21,592 --> 00:09:23,660
to crack that safe.

00:09:23,727 --> 00:09:28,026
Darin Hanson was released
from prison last month.

00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:30,946
Last known address, Vegas 

00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:33,801
I see
where you're going.

00:09:33,868 --> 00:09:36,571
So Hanson gets out of jail,
hooks up with our dead guy.

00:09:36,638 --> 00:09:37,739
Yeah, they hook it up...

00:09:37,805 --> 00:09:40,508
<i>break through</i>
<i>the rear entrance</i>

00:09:40,575 --> 00:09:42,243
<i>of the pottery store</i>

00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:44,178
<i>Hanson lances the safe...</i>

00:09:46,381 --> 00:09:49,083
<i>Once the safe is cracked,</i>
<i>Hanson steps back</i>

00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,885
<i>allowing Felton</i>
<i>to collect the cash.</i>

00:09:50,952 --> 00:09:53,154
<i>With Felton's attention</i>
<i>diverted</i>

00:09:53,221 --> 00:09:54,555
<i>Hanson seizes the moment...</i>

00:09:56,324 --> 00:09:57,859
<i>And kills him.</i>

00:09:57,925 --> 00:10:00,995
Revenge for testifying against
him and putting him in prison.

00:10:01,062 --> 00:10:02,630
That's not bad.

00:10:03,731 --> 00:10:05,300
Any chance you
found the murder weapon?

00:10:05,366 --> 00:10:08,269
No, no... but I think we know
who to ask.

00:10:08,336 --> 00:10:11,973
I haven't seen Joseph Felton
since the trial two years ago.

00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,474
So it's a coincidence
he was killed

00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:15,376
shortly after you were released
from prison.

00:10:15,443 --> 00:10:16,744
Yeah. Guy put me in jail.

00:10:16,811 --> 00:10:18,513
I had no reason
to see him again.

00:10:18,579 --> 00:10:20,181
He put you in the "Gray Bar"?

00:10:20,248 --> 00:10:21,382
Sounds like motive to me.

00:10:21,449 --> 00:10:22,884
BRASS:
Darin

00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:24,952
you and Felton,
you go back, huh?

00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:26,187
Mm-hmm.

00:10:26,254 --> 00:10:28,389
Knew the guy 15 years.

00:10:28,456 --> 00:10:30,958
My folks lived across the street
from him.

00:10:31,025 --> 00:10:32,894
We'd barbecue
with his wife and daughter.

00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,563
Then it must've really pissed
you off when he turned on you.

00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:37,532
STOKES:
The transcript
from your trial

00:10:37,598 --> 00:10:39,834
says that you used
a plasma lance

00:10:39,901 --> 00:10:43,037
in that '99 burglary,
and there it is again, Darin.

00:10:43,104 --> 00:10:44,505
Joe was the lance guy.

00:10:44,572 --> 00:10:47,075
He taught me how
to break into safes.

00:10:47,141 --> 00:10:48,876
That's why the MO's the same.

00:10:48,943 --> 00:10:50,712
BRASS:
Where were you
this morning

00:10:50,778 --> 00:10:52,246
early a.m.?

00:10:52,313 --> 00:10:55,249
I was in Barstow all week.

00:10:55,316 --> 00:10:57,752
Just got back
this afternoon.

00:10:57,819 --> 00:10:59,554
Okay...

00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,389
here you go...

00:11:01,456 --> 00:11:03,691
receipts from the trip.

00:11:03,758 --> 00:11:04,926
Go ahead.

00:11:08,363 --> 00:11:10,365
WILLOWS:
Looks authentic.

00:11:10,431 --> 00:11:14,769
Cactus Pine Cafe,
Barstow, noon today.

00:11:19,707 --> 00:11:21,075
We can't hold him.

00:11:24,145 --> 00:11:27,215
WOMAN:
21 years ago, the chief of
police sat in our living room

00:11:27,281 --> 00:11:29,450
and told us
our daughter was dead.

00:11:29,517 --> 00:11:30,818
After all this time,
She's in Vegas?

00:11:30,885 --> 00:11:32,286
That's a hundred miles
from our home.

00:11:32,353 --> 00:11:34,656
Well, we still don't know
where she is.

00:11:34,722 --> 00:11:38,192
Her prints in the pottery store
tell us that she <i>was</i> here

00:11:38,259 --> 00:11:41,529
possibly a few weeks ago,
but Vegas is a tourist town.

00:11:41,596 --> 00:11:43,765
But you know she's alive.

00:11:43,831 --> 00:11:45,600
I'm still not sure
we can find her.

00:11:45,667 --> 00:11:47,235
She's our only child.

00:11:47,302 --> 00:11:49,003
We never gave up hope.

00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:50,405
We're not giving up now.

00:11:50,471 --> 00:11:51,706
MILLER:
Excuse me.

00:11:51,773 --> 00:11:53,241
Teri...

00:11:53,308 --> 00:11:54,742
come in.

00:11:54,809 --> 00:11:55,977
Hi.

00:11:56,044 --> 00:11:57,378
Teri Miller, Mr.
and Mrs. Marlowe.

00:11:57,445 --> 00:11:58,479
Hello.

00:11:58,546 --> 00:11:59,614
Hi.

00:11:59,681 --> 00:12:01,215
GRISSOM:
Teri is a forensic artist.

00:12:01,282 --> 00:12:02,650
I called her
to help us.

00:12:02,717 --> 00:12:04,619
Did you bring
the photographs of Melissa?

00:12:04,686 --> 00:12:07,322
Yes, but I don't see
how they can help.

00:12:07,388 --> 00:12:09,757
In some of those,
she's just an infant.

00:12:09,824 --> 00:12:10,825
It doesn't matter.

00:12:10,892 --> 00:12:11,993
Do you remember her eyes?

00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,162
I could never forget.

00:12:14,228 --> 00:12:15,697
As we age,
our eyes don't change.

00:12:15,763 --> 00:12:16,931
That's where we'll start.

00:12:16,998 --> 00:12:18,433
Using computer software

00:12:18,499 --> 00:12:21,970
Teri can age Melissa's picture
so that we can determine

00:12:22,036 --> 00:12:24,339
what she looks
like today at age 25.

00:12:24,405 --> 00:12:25,640
Then we send it off

00:12:25,707 --> 00:12:27,408
to every law enforcement
agency in the state.

00:12:27,475 --> 00:12:28,743
It's been so long.

00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,144
Tell us the truth.

00:12:30,211 --> 00:12:31,746
What are
our chances?

00:12:31,813 --> 00:12:36,517
Well, 21 years ago, they told
you that your daughter was dead.

00:12:36,584 --> 00:12:39,487
Now we're moving
in the right direction.

00:12:50,699 --> 00:12:53,602
Where did you find him?

00:12:53,669 --> 00:12:58,974
At a pottery store
on Stansberry Street.

00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:01,076
Tammy, we've already
ID'd your father.

00:13:01,143 --> 00:13:03,445
If you don't
want to see him,
I'd understand.

00:13:03,512 --> 00:13:06,715
No, I want
to say good-bye.

00:13:06,782 --> 00:13:08,150
Well, don't be surprised

00:13:08,217 --> 00:13:10,252
by some swelling
and discoloration.

00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,475
You have any
other family?

00:13:33,542 --> 00:13:34,910
No.

00:13:38,947 --> 00:13:41,083
I can put you
in touch with a counselor

00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,584
if you need to talk.

00:13:42,651 --> 00:13:44,553
No, thank you.

00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:51,760
If there's anything you need...

00:14:11,213 --> 00:14:13,715
Tammy...

00:14:13,782 --> 00:14:16,451
were you at
the pottery store
with your father?

00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,588
What are you
talking about?

00:14:22,658 --> 00:14:24,793
WILLOWS:
There's some plant spores
on your sweater.

00:14:26,261 --> 00:14:28,864
We found them
on your father, too

00:14:28,931 --> 00:14:30,399
and matched them to some ferns

00:14:30,466 --> 00:14:31,733
behind the pottery store.

00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,101
I don't understand.

00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:37,072
What are you doing?

00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:38,874
I'm taking these spores
into evidence.

00:14:38,941 --> 00:14:43,912
They place you
at the crime scene.

00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,783
Is there anything you want
to tell me?

00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:54,490
Okay, I was there.

00:14:55,657 --> 00:14:56,825
Dad!

00:14:57,993 --> 00:14:58,927
Dad, don't do this.

00:14:58,994 --> 00:14:59,928
I'll get a job.

00:14:59,995 --> 00:15:01,130
We don't need the money.

00:15:01,196 --> 00:15:03,465
Tammy, go home.

00:15:07,136 --> 00:15:09,338
And I don't know what happened
after that.

00:15:09,404 --> 00:15:12,074
Why didn't you
just tell me that?

00:15:12,141 --> 00:15:13,942
I wanted to preserve
the good memories

00:15:14,009 --> 00:15:16,678
not remember my dad

00:15:16,745 --> 00:15:19,248
as a thief.

00:15:19,314 --> 00:15:22,050
I didn't kill him; I loved him.

00:15:24,486 --> 00:15:28,123
I need a release
from your office...

00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:30,058
so I can bury my father.

00:15:36,532 --> 00:15:38,967
Tell me everything you can
about this foot.

00:15:39,034 --> 00:15:40,269
Where's the rest
of the body?

00:15:40,335 --> 00:15:41,303
Incinerated.

00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:43,505
Lab results from the ashes
came back.

00:15:43,572 --> 00:15:44,740
Negative for accelerant.

00:15:44,807 --> 00:15:46,842
Nothing flammable
but sebaceous glutamate.

00:15:46,909 --> 00:15:48,043
Human fat.

00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,011
Well...

00:15:49,077 --> 00:15:50,712
I can tell you
that the malleolus--

00:15:50,779 --> 00:15:53,315
the ankle bone--
is completely hollowed out.

00:15:53,382 --> 00:15:56,685
Bone marrow was reduced to ash.

00:15:56,752 --> 00:15:59,955
Which means that the
foot was burned off
the body, not severed.

00:16:00,022 --> 00:16:03,125
That's consistent
with your theory of
spontaneous combustion.

00:16:03,192 --> 00:16:04,860
How do you know
about Sara's theory?

00:16:04,927 --> 00:16:06,128
Word gets around.

00:16:06,195 --> 00:16:08,297
You're siding with Sara
'cause you got a crush on her.

00:16:08,363 --> 00:16:10,165
No, that's why I wore
a clean coat.

00:16:10,232 --> 00:16:12,901
I'm just reporting
my observations.

00:16:12,968 --> 00:16:15,337
If the foot had been
severed, the marrow
would still be intact.

00:16:15,404 --> 00:16:19,575
So your official "observation"
is spontaneous combustion?

00:16:19,641 --> 00:16:20,609
Not yet.

00:16:20,676 --> 00:16:23,178
I want to send
a scraping down to toxicology.

00:16:24,313 --> 00:16:26,048
Excuse me.

00:16:26,114 --> 00:16:27,883
I want to check

00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:29,751
for any flammable
compounds in the blood

00:16:29,818 --> 00:16:31,687
but don't expect much.

00:16:31,753 --> 00:16:33,455
The quality of the sample

00:16:33,522 --> 00:16:36,191
may have been compromised
by the heat.

00:16:37,326 --> 00:16:38,494
I'm going to go talk
to Grissom

00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,495
see what he thinks.

00:16:39,561 --> 00:16:41,530
No, no, we're a team.

00:16:41,597 --> 00:16:43,665
The only place we're going
is back down

00:16:43,732 --> 00:16:44,900
to that crime scene.

00:16:44,967 --> 00:16:46,969
Okay, software's loaded.

00:16:47,035 --> 00:16:49,271
It's preprogrammed with
developmental averages?

00:16:49,338 --> 00:16:50,939
Exactly.

00:16:51,006 --> 00:16:54,109
Aging is about predictable
craniofacial growth.

00:16:54,176 --> 00:16:55,711
Faces grow down and out.

00:16:55,777 --> 00:16:57,179
So the first step
is to stretch

00:16:57,246 --> 00:16:58,614
the bottom half
of the face.

00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,351
You try.

00:17:02,417 --> 00:17:04,286
Go ahead.

00:17:10,225 --> 00:17:11,493
Well!

00:17:13,128 --> 00:17:14,196
Maybe you should drive.

00:17:14,263 --> 00:17:15,397
Good idea.

00:17:16,832 --> 00:17:18,867
Here we go.

00:17:18,934 --> 00:17:22,070
So at age four, the bridge
of the nose is taking shape

00:17:22,137 --> 00:17:24,273
and the interorbital distance
is established

00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:25,274
and baby teeth

00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:26,542
are visible.

00:17:26,608 --> 00:17:28,076
I have a question.

00:17:28,143 --> 00:17:29,878
Okay.

00:17:29,945 --> 00:17:32,147
Since I screwed up
our last date

00:17:32,214 --> 00:17:34,349
will we ever
have dinner again?

00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:35,717
Oh, we'll have dinner...

00:17:35,784 --> 00:17:38,086
just not together.

00:17:38,153 --> 00:17:39,421
So the ears

00:17:39,488 --> 00:17:42,157
are low and large
in proportion to the head.

00:17:42,224 --> 00:17:44,860
You know, I
did apologize.

00:17:44,927 --> 00:17:47,596
And you're forgiven.

00:17:47,663 --> 00:17:50,732
So over the next ten years,
the face elongates

00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,069
the skin thickens,
the hair pattern is set

00:17:54,136 --> 00:17:55,871
and the small deciduous teeth

00:17:55,938 --> 00:17:58,340
are replaced
by the secondary dentition.

00:17:58,407 --> 00:18:01,510
Once the face is aged

00:18:01,577 --> 00:18:04,046
I look to the mother
to fill in the blanks.

00:18:06,215 --> 00:18:07,316
Is that Mrs. Marlowe?

00:18:07,382 --> 00:18:08,417
Uh-huh.

00:18:08,484 --> 00:18:10,786
Most daughters at age 25
age quite similar

00:18:10,853 --> 00:18:13,422
to their mothers.

00:18:17,192 --> 00:18:19,828
A network of grids
allows me to fine-tune

00:18:19,895 --> 00:18:22,364
the tiniest facial
characteristics one
section at a time.

00:18:22,431 --> 00:18:28,170
I'm just softening a few edges,
growing the hair...

00:18:29,671 --> 00:18:32,875
and we're done.

00:18:32,941 --> 00:18:34,209
Well...

00:18:34,276 --> 00:18:35,444
hello, Melissa.

00:18:35,511 --> 00:18:37,379
Am I interrupting?

00:18:37,446 --> 00:18:38,380
Not at all.

00:18:38,447 --> 00:18:39,982
You're just in time.

00:18:40,048 --> 00:18:42,284
GRISSOM:
Catherine, say hello

00:18:42,351 --> 00:18:43,852
to Melissa Marlowe.

00:18:46,688 --> 00:18:48,624
Oh, my God.

00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:50,192
What?

00:18:50,259 --> 00:18:53,529
That's Tammy Felton

00:18:53,595 --> 00:18:55,230
and we've already met.

00:18:58,813 --> 00:19:01,116
Tammy Felton's
our murder suspect?

00:19:01,116 --> 00:19:03,018
She was kidnapped
21 year ago

00:19:03,085 --> 00:19:06,088
and may have killed the man
who raised her--

00:19:06,154 --> 00:19:08,891
possibly the same man
who kidnapped her.

00:19:08,957 --> 00:19:10,559
Whoa, wait. I
thought her prints

00:19:10,626 --> 00:19:12,828
from the crime scene--
they weren't fresh.

00:19:12,895 --> 00:19:15,063
Yeah, well, she could've
cased the place weeks ago

00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:17,399
and then remembered to wear
gloves on the big night.

00:19:17,466 --> 00:19:19,167
So what's the word
on the murder weapon?

00:19:19,234 --> 00:19:21,036
Well, the swab from the
head wound's at Trace.

00:19:21,103 --> 00:19:22,137
And?

00:19:22,204 --> 00:19:23,138
I'm on it.

00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:27,709
You and I have an appointment
with our shrink.

00:19:27,776 --> 00:19:29,044
Here-- you twirl, I'll talk.

00:19:29,111 --> 00:19:31,480
My son has Little League
in an hour.

00:19:31,547 --> 00:19:34,383
He's scared of the ball.

00:19:34,449 --> 00:19:36,418
You think this new bat's
going to do the trick?

00:19:36,485 --> 00:19:37,586
( <i>chuckling</i> )

00:19:37,653 --> 00:19:39,988
Why don't you just
talk with him?

00:19:43,959 --> 00:19:45,961
Dr. Kane, this girl
was kidnapped at age four.

00:19:46,028 --> 00:19:48,263
Would she have any recollection
of her prior life?

00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:51,200
The theory of infantile amnesia
suggests that we have

00:19:51,266 --> 00:19:53,635
no cognitive memory
before the age of three

00:19:53,702 --> 00:19:56,138
but since Tammy--
or Melissa--

00:19:56,205 --> 00:19:58,974
was taken from her biological
parents at age four

00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:01,643
she may remember something
of her former life.

00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:05,480
But these memories
would be... tenuous?

00:20:05,547 --> 00:20:08,684
A sound or a smell might awaken
some latent image or feeling

00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,052
but she'd have difficulty

00:20:10,118 --> 00:20:11,820
contextualizing
these sensations.

00:20:11,887 --> 00:20:14,423
That's got to be frustrating.

00:20:14,489 --> 00:20:17,125
And it's precisely
that frustration

00:20:17,192 --> 00:20:21,463
which dominates this woman's
present state of mind.

00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:23,765
Kidnapped children
at that age tend
to exhibit

00:20:23,832 --> 00:20:25,767
some degree of sociopathy

00:20:25,834 --> 00:20:27,035
as adults.

00:20:27,102 --> 00:20:28,537
Such as?

00:20:28,604 --> 00:20:32,574
Inability to feel guilt,
compassion or love, right?

00:20:32,641 --> 00:20:34,743
Correct, but the most
defining characteristic

00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:36,311
is their instinct for survival.

00:20:36,378 --> 00:20:37,813
There's nothing

00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,314
that they won't do.

00:20:39,381 --> 00:20:41,350
Tammy Felton needs help.

00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:45,187
She may be a suspect,
but she's also a victim.

00:20:45,254 --> 00:20:46,922
Cath, meet with her again.

00:20:46,989 --> 00:20:48,557
Ask open questions.

00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:52,761
Thanks for your insights,
Philip.

00:20:52,828 --> 00:20:54,930
I'll let you know
how this unfolds.

00:20:54,997 --> 00:20:57,599
Gil... be careful.

00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:59,368
Sociopaths
are dangerous

00:20:59,434 --> 00:21:01,336
because they don't function

00:21:01,403 --> 00:21:04,039
by the same... moral code
as the rest of us.

00:21:04,106 --> 00:21:08,043
Welcome to <i>my</i> world.

00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,545
I checked
with Homicide again.

00:21:09,611 --> 00:21:11,313
They found no evidence
of foul play.

00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,115
What about the husband--
is he still a suspect?

00:21:13,182 --> 00:21:14,116
No motive.

00:21:14,183 --> 00:21:16,185
O'Riley spoke with
friends and relatives.

00:21:16,251 --> 00:21:17,519
They were a loving couple.

00:21:17,586 --> 00:21:21,523
What about, uh...
life insurance policies?

00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:23,425
No, and you're reaching.

00:21:23,492 --> 00:21:24,927
I'm not the one
who's reaching here.

00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:26,562
We're scientists, right?

00:21:26,628 --> 00:21:29,731
We want answers,
the satisfaction of certainty.

00:21:29,798 --> 00:21:32,067
I'm not ignoring
scientific method.

00:21:32,134 --> 00:21:34,303
I'm just keeping an open mind.

00:21:34,369 --> 00:21:36,905
If we eliminate
all the alternatives

00:21:36,972 --> 00:21:39,775
we're left with
spontaneous combustion.

00:21:39,842 --> 00:21:41,076
That's exciting!

00:21:41,143 --> 00:21:44,246
That would be cool, but you've
been jumping to that conclusion

00:21:44,313 --> 00:21:45,247
from minute one.

00:21:45,314 --> 00:21:46,615
She's a pile of ash.

00:21:46,682 --> 00:21:48,450
Well, I brought
the ion detector.

00:21:48,517 --> 00:21:51,086
This will pick up
even the smallest traces

00:21:51,153 --> 00:21:52,421
of hydrocarbon fumes.

00:21:52,487 --> 00:21:54,723
I don't care what the lab says.

00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:58,827
This puppy will reveal exactly
what accelerant was used

00:21:58,894 --> 00:22:00,229
to start the fire.

00:22:00,295 --> 00:22:02,731
( <i>clicking</i> )

00:22:10,639 --> 00:22:12,074
( <i>clicking continues</i> )

00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,909
Well?

00:22:14,977 --> 00:22:16,111
( <i>clicking stops</i> )

00:22:16,178 --> 00:22:17,212
Nothing.

00:22:19,481 --> 00:22:21,717
You know I love you.

00:22:21,783 --> 00:22:25,287
Yes... no, I love <i>you</i> more.

00:22:25,354 --> 00:22:26,488
No, I love you more.

00:22:26,555 --> 00:22:28,156
( <i>clears throat</i> )

00:22:31,193 --> 00:22:33,228
Bye, baby.

00:22:33,295 --> 00:22:36,798
Do you have the results
on the swab yet?

00:22:36,865 --> 00:22:37,966
Uh...

00:22:38,033 --> 00:22:40,469
Uh... from the dead guy
at the pottery store?

00:22:40,536 --> 00:22:41,870
The coroner sent over
a sample.

00:22:41,937 --> 00:22:45,073
You were supposed to analyze
the mineral content.

00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,542
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.

00:22:46,608 --> 00:22:49,811
Grissom has just been running me
around like a lapdog.

00:22:49,878 --> 00:22:51,313
I haven't had a chance.

00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,649
Grissom's on a missing persons--
he hasn't sent you anything.

00:22:53,715 --> 00:22:56,084
Did I say Grissom?

00:22:56,151 --> 00:22:57,119
No, I meant Catherine.

00:22:57,186 --> 00:22:59,655
Oh, yeah.
Catherine's working with me.

00:22:59,721 --> 00:23:01,023
Oh.

00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:03,825
Well, what do you say we check
out that swab then, huh?

00:23:03,892 --> 00:23:05,594
Great.

00:23:05,661 --> 00:23:08,430
( <i>laughing</i> )

00:23:08,497 --> 00:23:10,999
Don't you ever
goof off, huh?

00:23:11,066 --> 00:23:13,869
Do you ever get a
little lost in life?

00:23:13,936 --> 00:23:15,604
No.

00:23:15,671 --> 00:23:17,706
Well, you should.

00:23:23,212 --> 00:23:26,315
STOKES:
Do you see the sparkling bits?

00:23:26,381 --> 00:23:28,283
Fluorescent minerals.

00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:29,885
Interesting.

00:23:29,952 --> 00:23:32,621
Here, do me a favor, will you?

00:23:32,688 --> 00:23:34,923
Put your nose
down the scope.

00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:36,959
When you see
the sparkling bits glow

00:23:37,025 --> 00:23:38,327
give a shout.

00:23:50,873 --> 00:23:52,541
Okay, ready?

00:23:52,608 --> 00:23:54,810
Yeah, ready.

00:23:59,381 --> 00:24:00,349
Lead.

00:24:00,415 --> 00:24:03,318
Zinc.

00:24:06,955 --> 00:24:08,223
Lithium.

00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:09,258
Anything?

00:24:09,324 --> 00:24:10,592
Nothing yet.

00:24:11,927 --> 00:24:14,730
Manganese.

00:24:17,099 --> 00:24:19,101
Petroleum.

00:24:22,404 --> 00:24:23,605
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

00:24:23,672 --> 00:24:24,673
Stop.

00:24:26,175 --> 00:24:28,110
It's uranium.

00:24:28,177 --> 00:24:29,478
Are you serious?

00:24:29,545 --> 00:24:32,548
Simple quantum
mechanics.

00:24:32,614 --> 00:24:35,717
When the molecule is bombarded
with energy at a specific level

00:24:35,784 --> 00:24:38,253
the electrons excite,
causing the mineral to glow

00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,822
and at this wavelength,
it's definitely uranium.

00:24:40,889 --> 00:24:41,990
Which is radioactive.

00:24:42,057 --> 00:24:44,326
Do we need to evacuate
the building or anything?

00:24:44,393 --> 00:24:47,162
The amount is trace.

00:24:47,229 --> 00:24:48,630
We should be fine.

00:24:48,697 --> 00:24:49,731
Are you sure?

00:24:49,798 --> 00:24:50,499
No.

00:24:52,034 --> 00:24:55,737
But I can tell you
one thing for sure--

00:24:55,804 --> 00:24:58,574
there is definitely uranium
on your murder weapon.

00:25:00,976 --> 00:25:02,411
I hear that, uh

00:25:02,477 --> 00:25:06,315
Greg found uranium on the swab
from Felton's skull.

00:25:06,381 --> 00:25:09,852
Yeah. He says I'm okay,
but you know Greg.

00:25:09,918 --> 00:25:12,988
Tell me, am I radiating
a green glow?

00:25:13,055 --> 00:25:15,257
You'll be fine, Silkwood.

00:25:15,324 --> 00:25:17,659
What's uranium doing
on a murder weapon, anyway?

00:25:17,726 --> 00:25:20,095
Well, before Peter Parker was
bit by that radioactive spider

00:25:20,162 --> 00:25:21,263
and became Spider-Man

00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:22,931
back in the '50s

00:25:22,998 --> 00:25:26,101
oxidized uranium flecks
were used as color enhancers.

00:25:26,168 --> 00:25:27,669
Color enhancers?

00:25:27,736 --> 00:25:29,204
Like paint?

00:25:29,271 --> 00:25:31,440
Paints, dyes, glazes...

00:25:31,506 --> 00:25:33,375
Since our guy
was killed

00:25:33,442 --> 00:25:35,544
in a pottery store...

00:25:35,611 --> 00:25:37,446
Say no more.

00:25:59,067 --> 00:26:01,403
( <i>clicking</i> )

00:26:17,953 --> 00:26:20,989
You got to be kidding me.

00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:22,391
You found Melissa?

00:26:22,457 --> 00:26:23,859
Yes.

00:26:23,926 --> 00:26:25,827
When can we see her?

00:26:25,894 --> 00:26:28,764
It's not quite that simple.

00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:29,798
What do you mean?

00:26:29,865 --> 00:26:31,266
Well, I don't want
to be evasive.

00:26:31,333 --> 00:26:33,101
It's just that, uh...

00:26:33,168 --> 00:26:36,572
we suspect
she might've committed a crime.

00:26:36,638 --> 00:26:38,340
What kind of crime?

00:26:38,407 --> 00:26:41,043
A homicide.

00:26:41,109 --> 00:26:42,611
This can't be happening.

00:26:42,678 --> 00:26:45,681
Mr. Grissom, we want to
see our daughter-- now.

00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,719
Tell me about
your mother.

00:26:50,786 --> 00:26:53,622
What's she got to do with this?

00:26:53,689 --> 00:26:56,291
Tammy, if you've got
nothing to hide

00:26:56,358 --> 00:27:00,095
and you want me to find out
who killed your father

00:27:00,162 --> 00:27:03,398
why don't you just
answer my questions?

00:27:03,465 --> 00:27:05,534
Mara, my mother...

00:27:05,601 --> 00:27:07,135
died a few years ago.

00:27:07,202 --> 00:27:10,372
I can let you see her,
but I can't allow you
to talk to her

00:27:10,439 --> 00:27:11,473
not right now

00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:14,142
and not under
these circumstances.

00:27:21,617 --> 00:27:24,253
WILLOWS:
Do you have
any siblings?

00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:27,389
Only child.

00:27:27,456 --> 00:27:29,291
How was your
childhood?

00:27:29,358 --> 00:27:31,226
Were you a
happy child?

00:27:31,293 --> 00:27:33,328
Did you have
any friends?

00:27:33,395 --> 00:27:36,865
Look, I don't see how these
questions are going to help you.

00:27:36,932 --> 00:27:38,800
May I go?

00:27:38,867 --> 00:27:41,370
Sure.

( <i>door slams</i> )

00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,115

Melissa...

00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:56,385
Excuse me?

00:27:56,451 --> 00:27:57,920

00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:04,359
I'm not your daughter.

00:28:09,231 --> 00:28:12,067
Who is she?

00:28:12,134 --> 00:28:14,970
Her name? Who is she now?

00:28:15,037 --> 00:28:17,472
Tammy-- Tammy Felton.

00:28:17,539 --> 00:28:19,474
Oh, my God.

00:28:19,541 --> 00:28:20,475
What?

00:28:20,542 --> 00:28:22,811
Mara Felton was our baby-sitter.

00:28:22,878 --> 00:28:26,849
The police questioned Mara
when Melissa disappeared.

00:28:26,915 --> 00:28:29,818
Tammy referred to her mother
as Mara, now deceased.

00:28:29,885 --> 00:28:31,653
I am her mother.

00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,822
Of course. I didn't mean...

00:28:33,889 --> 00:28:35,457
We need a lawyer.

00:28:35,524 --> 00:28:36,959
Why would you need a lawyer?

00:28:37,025 --> 00:28:39,061
Not for us; for our daughter.

00:28:46,501 --> 00:28:47,636
What were you thinking?

00:28:47,703 --> 00:28:49,004
I don't know.

00:28:49,071 --> 00:28:53,475
I wanted to observe them,
I guess.

00:28:53,542 --> 00:28:56,078
That woman hasn't seen
her daughter in 21 years.

00:28:56,144 --> 00:28:59,181
You actually thought a glass
wall would keep them apart?

00:28:59,248 --> 00:29:01,316
I never thought about that.

00:29:01,383 --> 00:29:02,518
I know.

00:29:02,584 --> 00:29:05,020
You're not good with people.

00:29:05,087 --> 00:29:06,655
Yeah.

00:29:08,557 --> 00:29:11,693
Interesting voice mail
you left me.

00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,328
What's that?

00:29:13,395 --> 00:29:16,298
"Meet me behind CSI
and bring a cotton nightgown."

00:29:16,365 --> 00:29:17,332
I'd wear it for you

00:29:17,399 --> 00:29:19,701
but, uh, I prefer pajamas.

00:29:19,768 --> 00:29:22,037
Really? It was actually
for my girlfriend here--

00:29:22,104 --> 00:29:23,338
Miss Piggy.

00:29:23,405 --> 00:29:25,374
We're experimenting
on a pig again?

00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,341
Yeah.

00:29:26,408 --> 00:29:28,410
You know,
I-I-I haven't eaten meat

00:29:28,477 --> 00:29:30,245
since Grissom used one

00:29:30,312 --> 00:29:32,581
to estimate
postmortem insect growth.

00:29:32,648 --> 00:29:35,083
Well, I tried for human
volunteers, but no takers.

00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,718
What are you going to do,
exactly?

00:29:36,785 --> 00:29:37,886
What are <i>we</i> going to do?

00:29:37,953 --> 00:29:40,689
We're disproving the existence

00:29:40,756 --> 00:29:42,191
of spontaneous
human combustion.

00:29:42,257 --> 00:29:43,659
You do not give up.

00:29:43,725 --> 00:29:46,228
Well, we're recreating the death
of Nadine Winston, right?

00:29:46,295 --> 00:29:48,397
She was wearing
a cotton nightgown-- thank you--

00:29:48,463 --> 00:29:51,166
and she had a half a
pack of smokes on her
end table which means

00:29:51,233 --> 00:29:52,534
she was probably smoking.

00:29:52,601 --> 00:29:54,803
If she burned herself
with a cigarette

00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:57,005
she would've woken up,
not burned up.

00:29:57,072 --> 00:29:59,675
Best part:
toxicology sample came back.

00:29:59,741 --> 00:30:01,877
Nadine had a high concentration

00:30:01,944 --> 00:30:02,911
of Seconal
in her blood.

00:30:02,978 --> 00:30:04,213
Sleeping pills.

00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:06,315
Enough to knock out a horse.

00:30:07,783 --> 00:30:10,752
All right.

00:30:15,524 --> 00:30:17,259
Care for a light?

00:30:28,604 --> 00:30:30,172
Now what?

00:30:30,239 --> 00:30:33,509
We wait.

00:30:35,811 --> 00:30:38,046
WILLOWS:
Hi, Tammy.

00:30:38,113 --> 00:30:40,015
We just, uh, want
to look around.

00:30:40,082 --> 00:30:41,617
We have a warrant.

00:30:41,683 --> 00:30:43,252
A warrant for what?

00:30:43,318 --> 00:30:46,788
Any evidence linking
you to the murder
of your father.

00:30:46,855 --> 00:30:48,123
Tammy, could you
step outside?

00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:49,825
This officer will
keep you company.

00:31:05,774 --> 00:31:06,909
( <i>clears throat</i> )

00:31:08,343 --> 00:31:09,645
What?

00:31:09,711 --> 00:31:11,880
I should get a finder's fee.

00:31:16,818 --> 00:31:18,654
Here. One for each of you.

00:31:21,356 --> 00:31:23,659
Yellow paint.

00:31:23,725 --> 00:31:25,527
Shall we test for uranium?

00:31:26,929 --> 00:31:29,698
I need a darkroom.

00:31:40,742 --> 00:31:42,377
Now, if uranium is present

00:31:42,444 --> 00:31:45,347
the photons should react
with the film.

00:32:11,974 --> 00:32:13,375
Well, that's affirmative
for uranium.

00:32:13,442 --> 00:32:15,911
Nicely done, Nick.

00:32:15,978 --> 00:32:17,379
Thanks.

00:32:29,124 --> 00:32:30,592
Miss, have you ever worn
these gloves?

00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:33,629
No. They belonged
to my mother.

00:32:35,397 --> 00:32:37,766
Really? Well, we'll see.

00:32:41,837 --> 00:32:43,405
Tammy, I need your

00:32:43,472 --> 00:32:45,374
right index finger.

00:33:31,854 --> 00:33:34,022
It's a perfect match.

00:33:35,924 --> 00:33:38,493
<i>Joe lanced the safe.</i>

00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,563
<i>Once the safe was cracked</i>

00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:45,200
<i>you seized the moment</i>
<i>and bashed his head in--</i>

00:33:45,267 --> 00:33:46,668
<i>three blows.</i>

00:33:49,671 --> 00:33:51,106
Nick, call Brass.

00:33:51,173 --> 00:33:54,343
Tell him it's time
to make an arrest.

00:33:54,409 --> 00:33:56,378
Done.

00:33:56,445 --> 00:33:58,213
You're making a mistake.

00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,148
I didn't kill my father.

00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:04,720
We weren't alone.

00:34:04,786 --> 00:34:06,722
I'm sorry, but there's
no evidence to indicate

00:34:06,788 --> 00:34:09,224
that there was a third person
present at the crime scene.

00:34:09,291 --> 00:34:11,527
Who else was there?

00:34:11,593 --> 00:34:15,664
I tried to stop her, I swear.

00:34:15,731 --> 00:34:17,232
Tammy...

00:34:19,101 --> 00:34:20,736
Who was with you?

00:34:22,304 --> 00:34:24,506
Melissa Marlowe.

00:34:27,376 --> 00:34:31,213
But that bitch wouldn't listen.

00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,549
So we're looking at
a split personality?

00:34:33,615 --> 00:34:34,716
Quite possible.

00:34:34,783 --> 00:34:37,553
Two personalities in one.

00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:38,921
Is there any
scientific evidence

00:34:38,987 --> 00:34:40,289
that supports
this disorder?

00:34:40,355 --> 00:34:42,124
Brain scans have
documented changes

00:34:42,191 --> 00:34:43,859
in the hippocampus
of individuals

00:34:43,926 --> 00:34:46,028
shifting from one personality
to another.

00:34:46,094 --> 00:34:47,930
But would these
two personalities

00:34:47,996 --> 00:34:49,531
be aware of each other?

00:34:49,598 --> 00:34:52,434
Well, usually the dominant
personality is aware

00:34:52,501 --> 00:34:53,936
of everything.

00:34:54,002 --> 00:34:57,005
The subjugated personality
is only aware of itself.

00:34:57,072 --> 00:34:58,574
Tammy's the dominant
personality.

00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,475
WILLOWS:
But Melissa killed

00:35:00,542 --> 00:35:03,579
Joseph Felton--
Tammy's father.

00:35:03,645 --> 00:35:07,416
Who was
also Melissa's kidnapper.

00:35:07,482 --> 00:35:08,817
BRASS:
But revenge
for a kidnapping

00:35:08,884 --> 00:35:11,253
21 years after the fact?

00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,688
Well, it <i>is</i> possible.

00:35:12,754 --> 00:35:15,591
It may have taken that long
for the subjugated personality

00:35:15,657 --> 00:35:16,959
to break free.

00:35:17,025 --> 00:35:20,596
BRASS:
Maybe, uh, Miss Mirror
Has Two Faces

00:35:20,662 --> 00:35:22,898
is playing us for fools.

00:35:22,965 --> 00:35:25,901
We corner her with the evidence,
she goes nuts

00:35:25,968 --> 00:35:28,604
sets the groundwork
for an insanity plea.

00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:30,405
Forensic Psychology
is a science.

00:35:30,472 --> 00:35:32,941
We have to stay open
to all the possibilities.

00:35:33,008 --> 00:35:34,743
( <i>knocking</i> )

00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:36,411
Captain?
Yeah?

00:35:36,478 --> 00:35:38,514
The girl's parents are here
with her attorney.

00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:40,616
Well, this ought
to be interesting.

00:35:48,976 --> 00:35:50,210
Melissa...

00:35:50,277 --> 00:35:55,249
Lady, I'm sorry,
but I don't know who you are.

00:35:55,316 --> 00:36:01,255
I'm not Melissa;
I'm Tammy-- Tammy Felton.

00:36:01,322 --> 00:36:04,091
Tammy, my name is Randy Painter.
I'm a defense attorney.

00:36:04,158 --> 00:36:06,193
The Marlowes have hired me
to defend you.

00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:08,996
I didn't kill my father.

00:36:09,063 --> 00:36:12,566
Melissa, I don't know
what you've been told

00:36:12,633 --> 00:36:15,102
but you're our daughter.

00:36:15,169 --> 00:36:17,905
You were taken from us.

00:36:17,972 --> 00:36:19,606
We've spent the last 21 years
looking for you.

00:36:19,673 --> 00:36:22,710
My father was Joseph,
my mother was Mara

00:36:22,776 --> 00:36:25,279
and they're both dead.

00:36:25,346 --> 00:36:26,947
Bail's been set at
half a million dollars.

00:36:37,091 --> 00:36:40,361
Are you looking at my necklace?

00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:45,399
Your father bought this for me
when you were born

00:36:45,466 --> 00:36:48,002
and you used to play with it.

00:36:55,576 --> 00:36:58,979
And we're not going
to let you go to jai.

00:36:59,046 --> 00:37:00,147
Right, Hank?

00:37:00,214 --> 00:37:01,915
Raising even ten percent

00:37:01,982 --> 00:37:03,283
won't be easy.

00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:04,918
( <i>sobbing</i> )

00:37:04,985 --> 00:37:07,454
Hank, she's not spending
another night away from us.

00:37:07,521 --> 00:37:08,455
Whatever it takes.

00:37:08,522 --> 00:37:09,857
When are we due in court?

00:37:09,923 --> 00:37:11,759
The prelim's tomorrow
morning, 9:00 a.m.

00:37:11,825 --> 00:37:13,761
Then I'd better hurry
with bail.

00:37:30,077 --> 00:37:32,513
I just got back to the lab,
saw the smoke. What's up?

00:37:32,579 --> 00:37:34,815
We're just working the case.

00:37:34,882 --> 00:37:35,983
Yeah, we're disproving

00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:37,484
spontaneous
human combustion.

00:37:37,551 --> 00:37:38,986
We dressed a pig up
in a cotton dress

00:37:39,053 --> 00:37:40,854
and torched it with a cigarette.

00:37:40,921 --> 00:37:42,656
And what happened?

00:37:42,723 --> 00:37:44,491
The pig's been reduced to ash.

00:37:44,558 --> 00:37:47,394
The fat acted like
candle wax; burned hot,
slow and intense.

00:37:47,461 --> 00:37:50,264
Nothing spontaneous about it.

00:37:50,331 --> 00:37:51,498
You both knew

00:37:51,565 --> 00:37:52,866
there would be a scientific

00:37:52,933 --> 00:37:55,202
explanation for the human torch,
though, right?

00:37:55,269 --> 00:37:56,403
Of course.

00:37:59,573 --> 00:38:00,841
Did you find the wick?

00:38:00,908 --> 00:38:01,909
The wick?

00:38:01,976 --> 00:38:03,444
The what?

00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:05,546
A piece of fabric
that's scorched

00:38:05,612 --> 00:38:08,182
but not completely
burned...

00:38:08,248 --> 00:38:10,451
like possibly
from the nightgown.

00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,555
We found the same thing
at the crime scene.

00:38:14,621 --> 00:38:15,656
It's called
the wick effect.

00:38:15,723 --> 00:38:17,324
It's like an inside-out candle.

00:38:17,391 --> 00:38:20,194
The fabric acts like a wick,
and the body burns inward

00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:22,162
explaining the high
temperatures

00:38:22,229 --> 00:38:23,664
which destroy the bone.

00:38:23,731 --> 00:38:27,101
The fabric ends up scorched,
but not completely burned.

00:38:27,167 --> 00:38:28,302
You knew about the ashes?

00:38:28,369 --> 00:38:30,904
Why didn't you say something
when you gave us the case?

00:38:30,971 --> 00:38:32,239
Well, in science

00:38:32,306 --> 00:38:34,341
we learn through
experimentation, right?

00:38:34,408 --> 00:38:36,577
Sometimes we need
to see it to believe it.

00:38:36,644 --> 00:38:39,380
You guys did
a nice job.

00:38:39,446 --> 00:38:42,416
Now you have to clean it up.

00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:48,622
Well, I would've looked
like an idiot.

00:38:50,124 --> 00:38:51,859
Thanks for covering.

00:38:51,925 --> 00:38:53,394
Well, you can show
your appreciation

00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:54,795
by, uh, cleaning up.

00:38:55,829 --> 00:38:57,998
Done.

00:38:58,065 --> 00:38:59,767
Thank you.

00:39:04,271 --> 00:39:06,707
I got a call
that Melissa wanted to see me.

00:39:06,774 --> 00:39:09,209
Thanks for coming.

00:39:09,276 --> 00:39:12,146
Am I speaking to Melissa...
or Tammy?

00:39:12,212 --> 00:39:13,714
Melissa.

00:39:13,781 --> 00:39:15,649
I know who I am now...

00:39:15,716 --> 00:39:20,788
after spending time
with my real parents.

00:39:20,854 --> 00:39:21,889
I'm not an attorney.

00:39:21,955 --> 00:39:23,590
There are no privileges here.

00:39:23,657 --> 00:39:24,758
Whatever you say...

00:39:24,825 --> 00:39:26,827
What are my chances... in court?

00:39:26,894 --> 00:39:30,331
The evidence is damaging.

00:39:30,397 --> 00:39:33,300
If I plead insanity...?

00:39:33,367 --> 00:39:36,837
You have a lawyer.
Why are you asking me?

00:39:36,904 --> 00:39:38,839
You wanted to help me.

00:39:38,906 --> 00:39:42,343
When I ID'd Joe, you were kind.

00:39:44,812 --> 00:39:46,246
I need you to testify

00:39:46,313 --> 00:39:48,949
that I was not sane
at the time that I killed Joe.

00:39:49,016 --> 00:39:50,918
My lawyer says

00:39:50,985 --> 00:39:53,954
that would go a really long way
with a jury.

00:39:54,021 --> 00:39:56,290
I'm not an expert.

00:39:56,357 --> 00:39:57,458
But it doesn't matter.

00:39:57,524 --> 00:39:58,726
You spent time with me.

00:39:58,792 --> 00:40:00,861
You could answer questions
the right way.

00:40:04,832 --> 00:40:08,702
I can't explain what happened
in that room today

00:40:08,769 --> 00:40:13,307
but it's like...
the only memories I have

00:40:13,374 --> 00:40:14,975
are of being a little kid.

00:40:15,042 --> 00:40:18,612
The last 21 years
are a blank--

00:40:18,679 --> 00:40:21,181
like they never happened.

00:40:26,587 --> 00:40:29,890
Then you shouldn't have
any memories of me...

00:40:29,957 --> 00:40:31,558
Tammy.

00:40:34,528 --> 00:40:37,464
There is no Melissa, is there?

00:40:37,531 --> 00:40:42,069
Get the hell out of here.

00:40:44,471 --> 00:40:45,973
I'm gone.

00:40:47,641 --> 00:40:49,677
( <i>little girl voice</i> ):
Don't go!

00:40:53,847 --> 00:40:56,450
Don't leave me here with her.

00:40:58,919 --> 00:41:01,055
( <i>normal voice</i> ):
Just practicing for court.

00:41:01,121 --> 00:41:02,589
Not bad, huh?

00:41:04,224 --> 00:41:05,559
Guard.

00:41:26,547 --> 00:41:29,683
Hey, come on, we're going
to be late for the prelim.

00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:32,653
Tammy Felton's prelim's been
postponed indefinitely.

00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,488
What? Why?

00:41:34,555 --> 00:41:36,757
She left town. Skipped bail.

00:41:36,824 --> 00:41:40,227
How much did the parents lose?

00:41:40,294 --> 00:41:42,830
Their house
and their life savings.

00:41:44,732 --> 00:41:47,401
It's over.

00:41:47,468 --> 00:41:48,902
Case closed.

00:41:48,969 --> 00:41:51,839
We move on.

00:41:51,905 --> 00:41:53,207
Right.

00:41:57,745 --> 00:41:58,946
Brass, it's Catherine.

00:41:59,013 --> 00:42:02,016
I need a credit card purchase
report on the Marlowes.

00:42:02,082 --> 00:42:03,283
The last 24 hours.

00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:04,585
Based on what?

00:42:04,652 --> 00:42:06,453
Based on the fact
that the Marlowes are blind

00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:09,089
when it comes to their daughter
and would do anything for her.

00:42:09,156 --> 00:42:11,558
We have no idea
where she is.

00:42:11,625 --> 00:42:13,294
Look, you're here, she's not

00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:16,063
and we know that
you helped her flee
the jurisdiction.

00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:17,364
What?

00:42:17,431 --> 00:42:19,366
22 bus tickets bought
with your credit card

00:42:19,433 --> 00:42:20,968
to 22 different states?

00:42:21,035 --> 00:42:23,937
You made sure that
we couldn't track her.

00:42:24,004 --> 00:42:26,607
Now, that's aiding and abetting
the flight of a suspected felon.

00:42:26,674 --> 00:42:29,143
Wherever you think she is--

00:42:29,209 --> 00:42:32,046
wherever you're planning
on meeting her--

00:42:32,112 --> 00:42:33,213
she's not there.

00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,515
She played you.

00:42:34,581 --> 00:42:36,483
Now, if you'll just tell us

00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:40,487
where she is,
we won't file charges, right?

00:42:40,554 --> 00:42:42,956
Well, if she's
apprehended, yes.

00:42:43,023 --> 00:42:45,492
Otherwise it's a felony.

00:42:45,559 --> 00:42:47,094
You're going to jail.

00:42:47,161 --> 00:42:51,565
Arrest us.

00:42:51,632 --> 00:42:55,402
Think about what
you're doing.

00:42:55,469 --> 00:42:57,137
We know exactly
what we're doing.

00:42:57,204 --> 00:42:58,372
Melissa's free.

00:42:58,439 --> 00:43:00,941
That's all that matters.

00:43:04,912 --> 00:43:06,447
Frankie?

00:43:08,015 --> 00:43:09,984
BRASS:
You have the right
to remain silent.

00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:11,986
Anything you say can and will be

00:43:12,052 --> 00:43:13,620
used against you
in a court of law...

00:44:01,268 --> 00:44:03,404
Am I late?

00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:05,439
Oh, you're worth waiting for.

00:44:07,474 --> 00:44:09,410
You owe me one, Darin.

00:44:09,476 --> 00:44:10,644
Owe you?

00:44:10,711 --> 00:44:12,980
I'm the one that told you
the truth about your father.

00:44:13,047 --> 00:44:15,916
And you knew exactly
what I'd do about it.

00:44:24,058 --> 00:44:26,060
Where to?

00:44:26,126 --> 00:44:28,062
Does it matter?
