00:00:19,015 --> 00:00:20,491
BOY:
Come on, Sky.

00:00:21,892 --> 00:00:24,061
Sky, come on.

00:00:25,929 --> 00:00:27,164
Go get it, Sky!

00:00:27,231 --> 00:00:29,533
( <i>barking</i> )

00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,634
Come on, Sky.

00:00:30,701 --> 00:00:32,002
MAN:
Bring it back, Sky.

00:00:32,069 --> 00:00:34,304
Bring it back, Sky.

00:00:34,371 --> 00:00:36,373
Good girl.

00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,041
That's not Sky's stick.

00:00:38,108 --> 00:00:40,577
What do you
have here, Sky?

00:00:40,644 --> 00:00:42,513
Come here, girl.

00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:43,680
What'd you get, here?

00:00:43,747 --> 00:00:45,582
What is it, Dad?

00:00:45,649 --> 00:00:49,486
Nothing... it's just...
uh, just an old bone

00:00:49,553 --> 00:00:53,190
probably from a dead
animal or something.

00:01:08,739 --> 00:01:13,210
It's a tibia...
or most of a tibia.

00:01:13,277 --> 00:01:15,579
How long you think
it's been out here?

00:01:15,646 --> 00:01:17,548
Well, long enough
for the animals
to pick it clean.

00:01:17,614 --> 00:01:18,749
And long enough
for the elements

00:01:18,816 --> 00:01:20,117
to have washed
away any evidence.

00:01:21,552 --> 00:01:22,619
Evidence of what?

00:01:22,686 --> 00:01:25,489
Well, it is a leg bone
and my guess is

00:01:25,556 --> 00:01:28,492
that it didn't walk
out here by itself.

00:01:28,559 --> 00:01:30,594
Well, it could have been
a hiker who got lost.

00:01:30,661 --> 00:01:32,329
It's interesting to me

00:01:32,396 --> 00:01:34,097
how you always
expect the worst.

00:01:34,164 --> 00:01:35,999
You see, that way,
I'm never disappointed.

00:01:36,066 --> 00:01:37,801
And then sometimes
I'm nicely surprised.

00:01:37,868 --> 00:01:39,303
So, can we call it
a crime scene?

00:01:39,369 --> 00:01:40,671
Potential crime scene.

00:01:40,737 --> 00:01:43,941
Did you know that
there's 206 bones
in the human body?

00:01:44,007 --> 00:01:47,077
Yes, Professor,
I, too, took Osteology.

00:01:47,144 --> 00:01:50,447
Well, 205 more
bones and we have
a complete skeleton.

00:01:50,514 --> 00:01:52,749
If we find the rest,
then we can determine

00:01:52,816 --> 00:01:55,119
whether or not
it was a murder.

00:01:55,185 --> 00:01:58,155
Well, I feel it in
every one of my 206 bones

00:01:58,222 --> 00:01:59,823
that this was a murder.

are on the case
from Mount Charleston.


00:02:38,389 --> 00:02:40,358
Nick, we could use
your help on that.
Outstanding.

00:02:40,425 --> 00:02:41,659
So I just talked
with the academy.


00:02:41,726 --> 00:02:42,860
We're getting an entire class


00:02:42,927 --> 00:02:43,962
of cadets meeting
us there.


00:02:44,028 --> 00:02:45,763
All you guys got to
go on is a bone?
Mm-hmm.

00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,565
GRISSOM:
The tibia.
Where there's one


00:02:47,632 --> 00:02:48,566
there's usually
another.


00:02:48,633 --> 00:02:49,567
So, we'll do
a grid search


00:02:49,634 --> 00:02:50,568
and we really could


00:02:50,635 --> 00:02:52,537
use your friend,
Teri Miller.


00:02:52,604 --> 00:02:53,905
I don't think
that's necessary.


00:02:53,972 --> 00:02:54,906
Well, why not?


00:02:54,973 --> 00:02:56,641
She's a forensic
anthropologist


00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:58,543
specializes in bones
and, hello...


00:02:58,610 --> 00:02:59,877
all we've got is a bone.


00:02:59,944 --> 00:03:02,046
I know what she
specializes in.


00:03:02,113 --> 00:03:04,382
If we hit a wall,
I'll call her.


00:03:04,449 --> 00:03:06,250
Okay.


00:03:06,317 --> 00:03:08,319
Sara, Warrick--


00:03:08,386 --> 00:03:10,588
dead body in
the Lucky Seven Motel.


00:03:10,655 --> 00:03:13,324
Is that the place
with that weird pool?


00:03:13,391 --> 00:03:18,096
"Maid found dead male body
in a hotel room."


00:03:18,162 --> 00:03:20,398
Any chance it's old age?


00:03:20,465 --> 00:03:23,601
Guy's 23. No.


00:03:23,668 --> 00:03:26,004
Sounds like a live one.


00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,071
Let's go.


00:03:41,152 --> 00:03:41,986
Stop!


00:03:50,662 --> 00:03:51,929
Looks like a piece
of skull bone.


00:03:59,637 --> 00:04:00,605
What are you doing?


00:04:00,672 --> 00:04:02,607
Bones are porous.


00:04:02,674 --> 00:04:05,343
They stick to the tongue.


00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:07,111
This doesn't stick.


00:04:07,178 --> 00:04:09,580
It's a piece of rock.


00:04:09,647 --> 00:04:11,449
I-I hope you had
your Hepatitis-B shot.


00:04:13,584 --> 00:04:15,687
Did you?


00:04:29,934 --> 00:04:32,337
It could be a piece
of wrist bone.


00:04:32,403 --> 00:04:34,005
Well, do you want
to suck it?


00:04:34,072 --> 00:04:36,674
To be sure?


00:04:36,741 --> 00:04:39,077
Flag man!


00:04:53,825 --> 00:04:56,361
Flag!

00:05:06,371 --> 00:05:07,739
Flag!

00:05:32,864 --> 00:05:36,267
So... you thinking
what I'm thinking?

00:05:36,334 --> 00:05:39,637
How amazing
the universe is.

00:05:39,704 --> 00:05:42,006
Everything made
from the same carbon.

00:05:42,073 --> 00:05:45,810
Stars to trees,
trucks to human bones.

00:05:45,877 --> 00:05:47,478
Mmm... no.

00:05:47,545 --> 00:05:50,114
I-I was thinking that we have
about 100 bone fragments.

00:05:50,181 --> 00:05:52,617
We could I.D. this body
before the end of the shift.

00:05:52,684 --> 00:05:53,685
Hmm.

00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,488
Stars and trucks?

00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:04,963
( <i>garbled radio transmission)</i>

00:06:16,441 --> 00:06:18,376
Only in Vegas.

00:06:18,443 --> 00:06:21,379
BROWN:
Looks like somebody had
a par-tay.

00:06:21,446 --> 00:06:22,714
Here's the wallet.

00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,949
Couple 20s inside.

00:06:25,016 --> 00:06:27,452
"Darren Pyne."

00:06:27,518 --> 00:06:28,720
Dead at 23.

00:06:28,786 --> 00:06:30,254
SIDLE:
Sign of struggle.

00:06:30,321 --> 00:06:31,856
I'll dust for prints.

00:06:31,923 --> 00:06:34,425
BROWN:
Looks like he was whacked
over the head with this lamp.

00:06:34,492 --> 00:06:35,560
SIDLE:
Yeah.

00:06:35,627 --> 00:06:37,862
One hit or there'd be blood.

00:06:37,929 --> 00:06:39,297
BROWN:
Unless each hit

00:06:39,364 --> 00:06:41,065
was to a different part
on his dome.

00:06:41,933 --> 00:06:44,269
Who's the room registered to?

00:06:44,335 --> 00:06:47,772
Well, you know, that would be
Celine Dion.

00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:51,943
But, uh, the bill was charged
to the credit card

00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:55,813
of a Lynn Henry,
Eau Claire, Wisconsin.

00:06:56,814 --> 00:06:57,749
O'Riley, you think...

00:06:57,815 --> 00:06:59,050
Right. Find out the last place

00:06:59,117 --> 00:07:00,218
she used
her credit card.

00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:19,604
WOMAN:
I love those shoes.

00:07:19,671 --> 00:07:20,705
You can wear
them again.

00:07:20,772 --> 00:07:22,273
And we have to
get your veil.

00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,441
We <i>have to</i>
get your veil.

00:07:23,508 --> 00:07:25,176
Lynn Henry?

00:07:26,678 --> 00:07:27,612
You know my name.

00:07:27,679 --> 00:07:29,047
What's yours?

00:07:29,113 --> 00:07:30,982
I'm Warrick Brown,
and this is Sara Sidle.

00:07:31,049 --> 00:07:31,983
Hi.

00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,484
We're with
the Las Vegas Crime Lab.

00:07:33,551 --> 00:07:34,485
Crime lab?

00:07:34,552 --> 00:07:36,020
About what?

00:07:36,087 --> 00:07:38,456
Darren Pyne was found
dead in your motel room

00:07:38,523 --> 00:07:39,657
at the Lucky Seven.

00:07:39,724 --> 00:07:41,459
Did you know him?

00:07:42,694 --> 00:07:44,095
Oh, my God.

00:07:44,162 --> 00:07:45,496
Yes, I-I do know him.

00:07:46,764 --> 00:07:47,865
Sort of.

00:07:47,932 --> 00:07:49,500
Sort of?

00:07:49,567 --> 00:07:51,269
Uh, we, we gave Meg

00:07:51,336 --> 00:07:52,870
a bachelorette
party last night.

00:07:52,937 --> 00:07:54,872
We hired a male dancer.

00:07:54,939 --> 00:07:55,607
I didn't want my fiancÃÂ©
to know

00:07:55,673 --> 00:07:57,175
because he's staying

00:07:57,241 --> 00:07:58,009
at this hotel.

00:07:58,076 --> 00:07:59,877
So we rented
a room in a sort of

00:07:59,944 --> 00:08:00,878
out-of-the-way
place.

00:08:00,945 --> 00:08:02,013
So, Darren was the dancer?

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,049
Yeah, h-he arrived
around... 10:00?

00:08:06,684 --> 00:08:07,719
( <i>all laughing</i> )

00:08:09,387 --> 00:08:11,255
Oh, my God!

00:08:12,624 --> 00:08:13,458
Whoo!

00:08:13,524 --> 00:08:14,726
If Steve could see me now.

00:08:14,792 --> 00:08:17,395
No husbands tonight, ladies.

00:08:17,462 --> 00:08:18,396
Or fiancÃÂ©s.

00:08:29,073 --> 00:08:30,508
So, we left at 3:00,
he was totally fine.

00:08:30,575 --> 00:08:32,844
He was danced out,
but definitely alive.

00:08:35,113 --> 00:08:36,281
He didn't leave when you did?

00:08:36,347 --> 00:08:37,782
No... uh, he asked
if he could stay

00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:39,484
and the room was

00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:42,654
already paid for,
so I didn't see a problem.

00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,423
Lynn, how did you get
those bruises on your wrists?

00:08:46,524 --> 00:08:47,659
Oh, my God!

00:08:49,827 --> 00:08:51,029
I-I don't know.

00:08:51,095 --> 00:08:52,263
I-I was totally
tipsy last night.

00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:53,765
I mean, falling

00:08:53,831 --> 00:08:55,433
all over everything.

00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,668
All right.

00:08:56,734 --> 00:08:58,303
We'll probably have
more questions

00:08:58,369 --> 00:09:00,238
after the coroner completes
his autopsy.

00:09:00,305 --> 00:09:01,873
If we need
to talk to you

00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,408
can we reach you here?

00:09:03,474 --> 00:09:04,709
Yes.

00:09:04,776 --> 00:09:06,978
My wedding is tomorrow.

00:09:07,045 --> 00:09:08,346
Whatever we can do to help.

00:09:08,413 --> 00:09:10,214
Thanks.

00:09:10,281 --> 00:09:11,616
Our card.

00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,989
Ankle bone?

00:09:51,055 --> 00:09:52,890
Medial malleolous?

00:09:52,957 --> 00:09:55,259
Goes on the bottom
of the tibia?

00:09:55,326 --> 00:09:58,796
That is correct...
according to this book.

00:09:58,863 --> 00:10:01,766
I'll take toe bones
for 200, Alex.

00:10:15,713 --> 00:10:18,383
"All the king's horses
and all the king's men

00:10:18,449 --> 00:10:21,386
couldn't put Humpty
Dumpty back together again."

00:10:21,452 --> 00:10:22,387
Hmm.

00:10:22,453 --> 00:10:24,255
Have we hit a wall yet?

00:10:24,322 --> 00:10:25,290
No.

00:10:25,356 --> 00:10:28,660
This was a man,
judging by the pelvic bone.

00:10:47,946 --> 00:10:48,880
Hey, Nicky?

00:10:48,947 --> 00:10:50,281
Yeah.

00:10:50,348 --> 00:10:52,717
Let's post this on
the Dental Society database--

00:10:52,784 --> 00:10:53,985
see if anyone responds.

00:11:02,427 --> 00:11:05,163
GRISSOM:
Five times the length
of the humerus

00:11:05,229 --> 00:11:07,765
means this guy was...

00:11:07,832 --> 00:11:09,601
six feet tall.

00:11:09,667 --> 00:11:11,035
But we don't
know his race

00:11:11,102 --> 00:11:12,036
and we don't know

00:11:12,103 --> 00:11:13,771
whether he was right-
or left-handed, yet.

00:11:13,838 --> 00:11:15,673
Well, he was old--
there's some calcification

00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,208
on the rib cartilage.

00:11:19,243 --> 00:11:20,578
60, 70 years old, maybe.

00:11:20,645 --> 00:11:22,213
Hmm.

00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:29,520
Are the bones whispering to you?

00:11:37,695 --> 00:11:39,731
Look at these jagged
marks on the bone.

00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,402
Wait a minute.

00:11:46,638 --> 00:11:48,673
This guy was chopped up.

00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:49,941
That's murder.

00:11:50,008 --> 00:11:52,176
Well, not necessarily.

00:11:52,243 --> 00:11:54,312
Could have happened
postmortem.

00:11:54,379 --> 00:11:56,481
You know, one of those
tractors up in the hills

00:11:56,547 --> 00:11:57,715
or a mulching
machine, maybe.

00:11:57,782 --> 00:11:58,683
A mulching machine?

00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,085
How long do you plan
on ignoring the obvious?

00:12:01,152 --> 00:12:03,021
A 70-year-old man
found in the mountains

00:12:03,087 --> 00:12:05,023
with clear evidence
he was chopped to pieces.

00:12:05,089 --> 00:12:07,759
That's a... homicide.

00:12:07,825 --> 00:12:09,060
WOMAN:
Well, you should check

00:12:09,127 --> 00:12:10,928
for hemorrhagic tissue
at the bone's tool marks...

00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:12,897
to be certain.

00:12:12,964 --> 00:12:14,565
Teri.

00:12:14,632 --> 00:12:15,466
Hi.

00:12:15,533 --> 00:12:16,834
Thanks for coming, Teri.

00:12:18,102 --> 00:12:19,604
I told you I was...
calling Teri...

00:12:20,772 --> 00:12:21,706
...didn't I?

00:12:21,773 --> 00:12:24,042
Anyway, what were
you saying about

00:12:24,108 --> 00:12:25,043
hemorrhagic tissue?

00:12:25,109 --> 00:12:26,744
It's blood in
the soft tissue.

00:12:26,811 --> 00:12:27,745
If you find it,
it means

00:12:27,812 --> 00:12:29,280
the guy was alive
when he was cut up.

00:12:29,347 --> 00:12:30,381
Hmm.

00:12:30,448 --> 00:12:33,084
Well, maybe you two
don't need me, after all.

00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:36,354
I would never turn away
a scientist of your talent.

00:12:38,289 --> 00:12:42,327
Uh, could I have a word
with you outside, please?

00:12:45,163 --> 00:12:47,966
You bring in a specialist
without my approval?

00:12:48,032 --> 00:12:49,634
And you don't
bring in one

00:12:49,701 --> 00:12:52,437
possibly compromise
the case, because you
two had a relationship?

00:12:52,503 --> 00:12:53,438
Relationship?

00:12:53,504 --> 00:12:54,839
I hardly know that woman.

00:12:54,906 --> 00:12:57,241
Oh... so I guess that
dopey look in your eye

00:12:57,308 --> 00:12:59,077
when she's around
is just that.

00:12:59,143 --> 00:13:00,545
Here's the deal--
we're using Cliff Notes

00:13:00,612 --> 00:13:02,180
to put that skeleton
back together in there.

00:13:02,246 --> 00:13:03,982
Teri is availing
her services.

00:13:04,048 --> 00:13:06,317
You said she's the best,
but hey, if you want

00:13:06,384 --> 00:13:07,318
me to send
her away...

00:13:07,385 --> 00:13:08,820
Just...

00:13:08,886 --> 00:13:11,189
check with me about
stuff like this, will you?

00:13:13,925 --> 00:13:15,393
Right.

00:13:21,266 --> 00:13:22,533
Sorry.

00:13:25,169 --> 00:13:26,371
So, how'd we do?

00:13:26,437 --> 00:13:28,573
Not bad.

00:13:31,743 --> 00:13:34,512
Scaphoid... cuneiform.

00:13:34,579 --> 00:13:37,682
However, this is a wrist bone

00:13:37,749 --> 00:13:39,851
and this...

00:13:39,917 --> 00:13:41,519
is a foot bone.

00:13:46,024 --> 00:13:48,159
I'm glad you're here.

00:13:57,282 --> 00:14:00,118
It looks like someone
in the Dental Society database

00:14:00,185 --> 00:14:01,152
saw your posting.

00:14:01,219 --> 00:14:02,153
Really?

00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,588
Sid Tucker.

00:14:03,655 --> 00:14:04,589
No way.

00:14:04,656 --> 00:14:06,258
A local dentist?

00:14:06,324 --> 00:14:08,426
He has records
that go back 30 years.

00:14:08,493 --> 00:14:10,328
Move over.

00:14:13,098 --> 00:14:15,634
"Hairline fissure

00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,636
of the mandibular canine."

00:14:17,702 --> 00:14:19,871
Oh, God,
why didn't I learn Latin?

00:14:19,938 --> 00:14:21,873
It's lower level

00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:25,210
third from the middle.

00:14:25,277 --> 00:14:26,978
Better memory than you.

00:14:27,045 --> 00:14:29,514
<i>And...</i>

00:14:29,581 --> 00:14:32,484
our first character match.

00:14:33,518 --> 00:14:35,186
"Overlapping left incisors."

00:14:35,253 --> 00:14:37,455
That's the front teeth, right?

00:14:37,522 --> 00:14:38,657
Two for two.

00:14:42,594 --> 00:14:43,695
"Gold fillings."

00:14:43,762 --> 00:14:45,130
Well, I know that.

00:14:45,196 --> 00:14:46,998
He's got
gold fillings

00:14:47,065 --> 00:14:50,669
in adjoining right molars
and interspersed in left molars.

00:14:50,735 --> 00:14:51,970
Tell me

00:14:52,037 --> 00:14:53,405
this is all we need.

00:14:53,471 --> 00:14:56,141
Nolan Ryan pitches
another perfect game.

00:14:56,207 --> 00:14:58,543
And the winner is...

00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:01,146
STOKES:
Mel Bennett.

00:15:01,213 --> 00:15:02,314
326 Franklin Street.

00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:05,884
Date of birth
September 6, 1931.

00:15:05,951 --> 00:15:08,753
He was 70.

00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,589
An electric saw?
You sure?

00:15:10,655 --> 00:15:13,358
Grooves from a
handsaw would be
straight, parallel.

00:15:13,425 --> 00:15:14,893
Now look
at the grooves

00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,295
along the medial
condyle of the femur.

00:15:17,362 --> 00:15:19,231
They're coarse. See?

00:15:20,265 --> 00:15:22,167
A reciprocating
electric saw

00:15:22,234 --> 00:15:23,935
was used on this person.

00:15:24,002 --> 00:15:25,870
WILLOWS:
Excuse me, um,
the person's name

00:15:25,937 --> 00:15:26,871
is Mel Bennett.

00:15:26,938 --> 00:15:27,872
We just confirmed it.

00:15:27,939 --> 00:15:29,074
We're going to meet Brass

00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,375
at the widow's house.

00:15:30,442 --> 00:15:31,576
I got to go.
Thank you.

00:15:31,643 --> 00:15:33,478
Nick, would you stay here
and work with Teri

00:15:33,545 --> 00:15:34,679
on this soft tissue stuff?

00:15:34,746 --> 00:15:36,014
She'll explain it to you.

00:15:36,081 --> 00:15:37,215
Sure.

00:15:37,282 --> 00:15:38,650
ROBBINS:
Our male dancer.

00:15:38,717 --> 00:15:40,252
Multiple blows
to the head?

00:15:40,318 --> 00:15:41,419
That's right.

00:15:41,486 --> 00:15:43,288
And one of those blows
did enough damage

00:15:43,355 --> 00:15:44,556
to cause cranial bleeding.

00:15:44,623 --> 00:15:47,025
Any of your ladies mention

00:15:47,092 --> 00:15:48,393
having sex with this victim?

00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,594
No.

00:15:49,661 --> 00:15:51,129
Just lap dances, nothing more.

00:15:51,196 --> 00:15:54,766
I think the dance might
have been a bit more intimate.

00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:57,769
Penile swab's back
from the lab.

00:15:57,836 --> 00:15:59,170
Vaginal cells.

00:15:59,237 --> 00:16:01,172
Looks like
fried eggs.

00:16:01,239 --> 00:16:03,608
That's because
the cells are fresh.

00:16:03,675 --> 00:16:06,077
Darren had sex
just before he died.

00:16:06,144 --> 00:16:09,614
What's the estimated
time of death?

00:16:09,681 --> 00:16:11,049
Midnight.

00:16:11,116 --> 00:16:12,551
What?!

00:16:12,617 --> 00:16:15,453
These ladies said he was alive
when they left him at 3:00 a.m.

00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,255
Someone's lying.

00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:21,726
I don't mean to be snippy

00:16:21,793 --> 00:16:23,862
but we're already late
for my rehearsal dinner.

00:16:23,929 --> 00:16:25,297
Dinner's going to have
to wait.

00:16:25,363 --> 00:16:27,265
We have forensic proof
that Darren Powell

00:16:27,332 --> 00:16:29,200
had sex with a woman
just before he died.

00:16:29,267 --> 00:16:30,435
And as far as we can tell

00:16:30,502 --> 00:16:32,304
you were the last three women
with him.

00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:34,005
So, who's lying?

00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:51,122
I have two small children
and a husband.

00:16:51,189 --> 00:16:53,258
I can't be involved in this.

00:16:53,325 --> 00:16:55,994
( <i>whispering</i> ):
Joyce... shut up.

00:16:56,061 --> 00:16:57,162
About what?

00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:01,099
Lynn, does this have
anything to do

00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:03,335
with the bruises on your wrists?

00:17:03,401 --> 00:17:05,637
BROWN:
Hey, tell us

00:17:05,704 --> 00:17:07,272
or tell the D.A.

00:17:15,013 --> 00:17:17,616
Okay.

00:17:17,682 --> 00:17:20,452
After the bachelorette party,
we left.

00:17:20,518 --> 00:17:25,290
<i>I forgot my purse,</i>
<i>so I ran back in to get it.</i>

00:17:31,096 --> 00:17:32,964
Let go of me. Let go!

00:17:33,031 --> 00:17:34,032
No!

00:17:34,099 --> 00:17:35,367
Get off!

00:17:35,433 --> 00:17:37,035
Oh, no.

00:17:37,102 --> 00:17:41,273
<i>I told him no, but he just</i>
<i>wouldn't take no for an answer.</i>

00:17:41,339 --> 00:17:42,974
So he raped you.

00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:44,976
That's how I got the bruises
on my wrists.

00:17:45,043 --> 00:17:47,212
I didn't even
tell them

00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:49,047
until we got back to the hotel.

00:17:49,114 --> 00:17:50,682
Was Darren alive when you left?

00:17:50,749 --> 00:17:53,518
Very... unfortunately.

00:17:53,585 --> 00:17:54,953
WHEELER:
So...

00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,187
can we go now?

00:17:56,254 --> 00:17:59,124
My fiancee
is already asking questions.

00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:01,860
Yeah, you can go,
but Lynn, uh...

00:18:01,927 --> 00:18:03,495
a car's going to take you

00:18:03,562 --> 00:18:05,630
to the hospital for an exam.

00:18:05,697 --> 00:18:08,333
An exam for what?

00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,503
It's just standard procedure
for sexual assault.

00:18:14,773 --> 00:18:16,942

Are you Mrs. Bennett?

00:18:24,015 --> 00:18:25,116
Oh, yes.

00:18:25,183 --> 00:18:26,952
Is this about my car plates?

00:18:27,018 --> 00:18:28,286
I have them.

00:18:28,353 --> 00:18:30,555
I just haven't had time
to put them on the car.

00:18:30,622 --> 00:18:32,257
Actually,
Mrs. Bennett

00:18:32,324 --> 00:18:35,093
we're here about
your husband, Mel.

00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:39,097
Oh, well,
Mel isn't here right now.

00:18:39,164 --> 00:18:41,766
Well, do you know
where he is?

00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:43,435
Yes, he's at the store.

00:18:45,136 --> 00:18:46,404
Is there a problem?

00:18:46,471 --> 00:18:48,673
( <i>garbled radio transmission)</i>

00:18:53,511 --> 00:18:56,181
Mrs. Bennett, we're going
to ask you a few questions

00:18:56,248 --> 00:18:57,282
down at the station.

00:18:57,349 --> 00:18:58,817
But I haven't done anything.

GRISSOM:
She looks... distraught.

00:19:02,988 --> 00:19:05,590
Well, is that because
she just found out
he's dead or...

00:19:05,657 --> 00:19:08,426
because she got caught?

00:19:08,493 --> 00:19:10,562
( <i>car door closes</i> )

00:19:10,629 --> 00:19:15,467
Interesting how people
catalog their lives.

00:19:15,533 --> 00:19:16,935
50 years of marriage
on the wall.

00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:21,640
BRASS:
Yeah, that's
a lot of years.

00:19:21,706 --> 00:19:24,442
Maybe a few too many
for the missus.

00:19:24,509 --> 00:19:25,777
Oh, I don't know.

00:19:25,844 --> 00:19:27,479
These two

00:19:27,546 --> 00:19:29,681
were good with each other.

00:19:31,216 --> 00:19:32,817
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:19:32,884 --> 00:19:35,654
It takes a bad marriage
to recognize a good one.

00:19:46,398 --> 00:19:50,068
Well, not even
an aspirin.

00:19:54,372 --> 00:19:55,640
Look at this.

00:19:55,707 --> 00:19:58,710
This bathtub hasn't
been used lately.

00:20:01,713 --> 00:20:04,716
Well, maybe she only uses
her other bathroom.

00:20:12,224 --> 00:20:15,060
Tub's the most obvious place
to cut up a body

00:20:15,126 --> 00:20:17,395
but I don't see anything
down there.

00:20:17,462 --> 00:20:18,997
Try phenolphthalein?

00:20:19,064 --> 00:20:22,434
Give me a swab.

00:20:45,423 --> 00:20:47,592
Hmm...

00:20:52,597 --> 00:20:53,932
How'd you guys do?

00:20:53,999 --> 00:20:55,700
We found blood in the drain.

00:20:55,767 --> 00:20:57,269
You find anything?

00:20:57,335 --> 00:20:58,436
Just the murder weapon.

00:21:01,406 --> 00:21:04,776
Cleaned, in the widow's garage.

They are the most like
humans, as you know.

00:21:22,327 --> 00:21:24,963
This saw matches the one Brass
found in Mrs. Bennett's garage?

00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,431
Exact model.

00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:29,801
No doubt about it.

00:21:29,868 --> 00:21:31,736
The marks on this bone

00:21:31,803 --> 00:21:34,039
are consistent
with the marks

00:21:34,105 --> 00:21:36,107
on Mel Bennett's bones.

00:21:36,174 --> 00:21:38,109
Exact same electric saw,
same blade.

00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:39,878
GRISSOM:
Can you tell
us anything

00:21:39,945 --> 00:21:41,446
about the operator?

00:21:41,513 --> 00:21:43,014
You mean, Mrs. Bennett?

00:21:44,115 --> 00:21:45,116
Oh, right.

00:21:45,183 --> 00:21:46,551
( <i>whispering</i> ):
Reserve judgment.

00:21:46,618 --> 00:21:47,886
How someone operates

00:21:47,953 --> 00:21:51,056
a saw is as telling as how
someone operates a pen.

00:21:51,122 --> 00:21:52,991
Now look at the femur.

00:21:53,058 --> 00:21:55,293
The skipping marks
of a saw over the bone

00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,763
tell us whoever used the saw
was unfamiliar with its use.

00:22:01,633 --> 00:22:04,069
An amateur, if you will.

00:22:04,135 --> 00:22:07,205
Someone with a weakened nature,
compromised musculature.

00:22:18,681 --> 00:22:20,283
What do you mean,
"It doesn't add up?"

00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:22,452
SIDLE:
Well, we're assuming
that a couple of lamp hits

00:22:22,519 --> 00:22:23,787
to the head
killed Darren, right?

00:22:23,853 --> 00:22:24,988
For now, yeah.

00:22:25,055 --> 00:22:26,689
You read the Coroner's
final report.

00:22:26,756 --> 00:22:29,659
There's no traces of that lamp
on his head at points of impact.

00:22:29,726 --> 00:22:32,095
Yeah, but maybe
the materials didn't adhere.

00:22:32,162 --> 00:22:35,131
Doesn't mean he wasn't hit
in the head with the lamp.

00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,235
What are you looking for?

00:22:39,302 --> 00:22:40,403
I don't know yet.

00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:42,572
I'll let you know
when I find it.

00:22:42,639 --> 00:22:45,475
Well, if you don't know,
I can't help you.

00:22:49,446 --> 00:22:50,814
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,949
What is this?

00:22:54,417 --> 00:22:56,519
What? What do you got?

00:22:56,586 --> 00:22:58,021
Some something.

00:22:58,088 --> 00:22:59,222
Where?

00:22:59,289 --> 00:23:00,657
Right there.

00:23:00,724 --> 00:23:02,859
Good job.

00:23:19,409 --> 00:23:21,411
SIDLE:
Tiniest diamond in the world.

00:23:21,478 --> 00:23:23,380
Oh, you think so, huh?

00:23:32,922 --> 00:23:35,225
( <i>glass squeaks</i> )

00:23:37,994 --> 00:23:39,696
No.

00:23:39,763 --> 00:23:41,698
Diamonds cut glass.

00:23:41,765 --> 00:23:44,134
This is some
cheap-ass cubic zirconia.

00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,636
The bride-to-be's ring, maybe?

00:23:46,703 --> 00:23:48,204
She was here.

00:23:48,271 --> 00:23:50,273
Let's go ask her.

00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,108
Why do you keep
asking me

00:23:52,175 --> 00:23:53,943
these kinds of
questions?

00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:56,579
Well, because someone killed
your husband, Mrs. Bennett...

00:23:56,646 --> 00:23:58,782
and was strong
enough to wield

00:23:58,848 --> 00:24:00,650
an electric
saw to do it.

00:24:00,717 --> 00:24:03,153
But not so strong
as to make clean cuts.

00:24:03,219 --> 00:24:05,321
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:24:05,388 --> 00:24:07,757
I didn't kill Mel.

00:24:07,824 --> 00:24:09,459
I loved him.

00:24:09,526 --> 00:24:11,461
Why didn't you
report him missing?

00:24:11,528 --> 00:24:13,797
I mean, were you used
to him leaving

00:24:13,863 --> 00:24:15,298
or, did you fight much?

00:24:15,365 --> 00:24:16,833
Never.

00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,535
Never.

00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:22,439
We had a perfect marriage.

00:24:22,505 --> 00:24:25,308
Perfect.

00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:27,410
And you failed
to report him missing

00:24:27,477 --> 00:24:29,179
for seven months because...?

00:24:29,245 --> 00:24:31,915
I don't like your tone,
young man.

00:24:33,316 --> 00:24:36,720
Detective, you said I could have
an attorney at any time.

00:24:36,786 --> 00:24:38,521
I think I'd like one now.

00:24:38,588 --> 00:24:39,856
Oh, sure, Mrs.
Bennett, sure.

00:24:42,192 --> 00:24:43,293
Just sign this
form, please.

00:24:53,837 --> 00:24:56,206
SIDLE:
Every time we go
to find these girls

00:24:56,272 --> 00:24:57,574
they're somewhere else.

00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,309
You sure you got
that address?

00:24:59,376 --> 00:25:01,644
The desk clerk was
talking very quickly.

00:25:01,711 --> 00:25:03,747
They talk faster
at the sports book.

00:25:03,813 --> 00:25:05,248
What?
In the old days.

00:25:05,315 --> 00:25:06,750
Oh.

00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:08,685
You think we're dressed
for a wedding?

00:25:08,752 --> 00:25:09,819
Yeah, not my wedding.

00:25:09,886 --> 00:25:10,954
( <i>beeper beeping</i> )

00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:12,322
What?

00:25:12,389 --> 00:25:14,457
Lynn Henry's
SART exam's in.

00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:19,829
She lied to us.

00:25:19,896 --> 00:25:22,165
At this point, I think all
those girls are lying to us.

00:25:22,232 --> 00:25:23,433
All right, let's
call Homicide

00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,634
tell them to
meet us there.

00:25:25,835 --> 00:25:28,238
Let's put this to bed
before the honeymoon.

00:25:29,606 --> 00:25:31,274
( <i>tires screech</i> )

00:25:48,358 --> 00:25:51,261
Sorry, Elvis, the wedding party
has to leave the building.

00:25:55,098 --> 00:25:56,499
( <i>whispers</i> )
What?
Oh, my God.

00:25:56,566 --> 00:25:58,068
What's going on?

00:25:58,134 --> 00:26:00,203
All three of you ladies are
coming in for questioning

00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:01,404
in the murder of Darren Pyne.

00:26:01,471 --> 00:26:02,639
Murder?

00:26:02,705 --> 00:26:04,307
Is this a joke?

00:26:04,374 --> 00:26:06,476
The clock's going
to explain it all,
believe me.

00:26:06,543 --> 00:26:08,344
LUKE:
The, the clock?

00:26:08,411 --> 00:26:11,014
What, what clock?

00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:14,718
Hey!

00:26:14,784 --> 00:26:15,852
Hi.

00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:16,853
Where you going?

00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,887
I'm leaving.

00:26:17,954 --> 00:26:19,989
Town?

00:26:20,056 --> 00:26:21,591
Don't worry, I was able

00:26:21,658 --> 00:26:24,360
to isolate some soft tissue
from the preserved vertebrae.

00:26:24,427 --> 00:26:27,197
Nick's working
on it now.

00:26:27,263 --> 00:26:29,165
Well, I'm going to go
check that out.

00:26:29,232 --> 00:26:30,533
Teri...

00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,701
you rule.

00:26:31,768 --> 00:26:34,270
Thanks, Catherine.

00:26:34,337 --> 00:26:36,506
Well...

00:26:36,573 --> 00:26:39,142
have a safe trip.

00:26:39,209 --> 00:26:40,810
Yeah.

00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:46,783
I-I need to apologize for not
returning your call last month.

00:26:48,551 --> 00:26:51,121
Teri, I admire your
dedication to your work.

00:26:51,187 --> 00:26:52,856
Um, dedication
to my work

00:26:52,922 --> 00:26:55,725
didn't keep me from
returning your call.

00:26:55,792 --> 00:26:58,428
Oh.

00:26:59,929 --> 00:27:01,297
It, it was nothing.

00:27:01,364 --> 00:27:03,566
I-I-I just called to
see how you were doing.

00:27:05,402 --> 00:27:07,904
Um... well...

00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:13,910
Are you still interested
in how I'm doing?

00:27:15,111 --> 00:27:17,247
Of course.

00:27:19,549 --> 00:27:21,618
So...

00:27:21,684 --> 00:27:24,487
what's next?

00:27:24,554 --> 00:27:26,756
Mutilation in the Everglades.

00:27:26,823 --> 00:27:28,825
Maybe it was just an alligator.

00:27:28,892 --> 00:27:30,293
Yeah.

00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,796
And if it's not, I'll be filing
for a change of address again.

00:27:34,898 --> 00:27:37,600
Anyway...

00:27:37,667 --> 00:27:38,802
I got to go.

00:27:39,969 --> 00:27:43,106
Do you have to go?

00:27:43,173 --> 00:27:44,908
I mean...

00:27:44,974 --> 00:27:46,576
couldn't you take
a later flight?

00:27:46,643 --> 00:27:48,545
More bones?

00:27:50,447 --> 00:27:51,981
Have dinner with me later.

00:27:56,119 --> 00:27:58,388
I think the bodies will keep.

00:28:01,791 --> 00:28:03,626
See the tissue?

00:28:03,693 --> 00:28:05,128
I do.

00:28:05,195 --> 00:28:06,963
There's no evidence
of blood.

00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:08,164
Yeah.

00:28:08,231 --> 00:28:09,566
Tells us blood
was <i>not</i> pumping

00:28:09,632 --> 00:28:11,768
through Mel Bennett's veins
when he was cut up.

00:28:11,835 --> 00:28:13,303
Which means he
was already dead.

00:28:13,369 --> 00:28:14,404
Yeah.

00:28:14,471 --> 00:28:16,539
So, what does
that leave us?

00:28:16,606 --> 00:28:18,742
A <i>spectrum</i> of
possibilities.

00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:21,644
The universe.

00:28:21,711 --> 00:28:25,014
Leaves me with a Black Widow.

00:28:26,316 --> 00:28:28,218
We want to thank the crime lab
for discovering

00:28:28,284 --> 00:28:29,753
that Mrs. Bennett's husband
was dead

00:28:29,819 --> 00:28:30,920
when she disassembled him.

00:28:30,987 --> 00:28:32,088
WILLOWS:
Disassembled him?

00:28:32,155 --> 00:28:33,423
So she admits to taking

00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:35,225
an electric saw to her husband?

00:28:35,291 --> 00:28:37,093
After he was dead, yes.

00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,462
As you know, in Nevada,
there's no law against

00:28:39,529 --> 00:28:40,697
cutting up a dead body.

00:28:40,764 --> 00:28:42,766
There's no law saying
it's okay, either.

00:28:42,832 --> 00:28:43,833
Does your
client care

00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,268
to tell us <i>how</i>

00:28:45,335 --> 00:28:47,404
her husband
came to be dead?

00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:48,838
Well, she has no idea.

00:28:48,905 --> 00:28:50,573
She came home
from the grocer's

00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,808
went into
the bathroom

00:28:51,875 --> 00:28:54,077
and there he was in
the tub, deceased.

00:28:55,478 --> 00:28:56,880
No.

00:28:56,946 --> 00:28:59,149
I-I want to explain.

00:29:01,017 --> 00:29:03,086
Briefly, Mrs. Bennett.

00:29:04,754 --> 00:29:07,190
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:29:07,257 --> 00:29:09,592
I couldn't afford the burial.

00:29:09,659 --> 00:29:12,028
So I-I got the saw...

00:29:12,095 --> 00:29:16,466
and I cut him
into manageable pieces.

00:29:17,834 --> 00:29:19,235
Manageable?

00:29:19,302 --> 00:29:21,104
Mmm.

00:29:23,273 --> 00:29:27,310
You made it easier
to transport his body?

00:29:27,377 --> 00:29:29,412
Yeah.

00:29:29,479 --> 00:29:31,581
To Mount Charleston.

00:29:33,683 --> 00:29:35,618
( <i>door opens</i> )

00:29:35,685 --> 00:29:37,153
I called
that whistle-blower's line

00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,621
at the local Treasury office.

00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:40,824
You know, the one that handles
social security fraud?

00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:42,125
They were happy to help.

00:29:47,697 --> 00:29:49,666
Well, Mrs. Bennett...

00:29:49,733 --> 00:29:52,302
can you afford the burial now?

00:29:55,371 --> 00:29:56,473
What are you talking about?

00:29:56,539 --> 00:29:58,775
It's her husband's
social security checks

00:29:58,842 --> 00:30:00,176
from the last two years.

00:30:00,243 --> 00:30:01,911
BRASS:
The signature's
the same

00:30:01,978 --> 00:30:03,113
till seven months ago.

00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:04,481
Q.D. matched the
lady's writing.

00:30:04,547 --> 00:30:06,483
Mrs. Bennett,
you've been cashing

00:30:06,549 --> 00:30:09,152
your dearly departed's checks,
haven't you?

00:30:10,487 --> 00:30:12,856
And that's fraud.

00:30:15,392 --> 00:30:17,360
It's also a motive.

00:30:17,427 --> 00:30:18,928
FINN:
If you want to alert
the Government

00:30:18,995 --> 00:30:21,798
about some forged social
security checks, be my guest.

00:30:21,865 --> 00:30:23,533
But there's
no murder here.

00:30:25,001 --> 00:30:27,103
We're done.

00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:29,372
Excuse me.

00:30:43,527 --> 00:30:44,995
WILLOWS:
Typical Vegas wife--

00:30:45,061 --> 00:30:46,530
offs her old man
for the money

00:30:46,596 --> 00:30:50,200
and there's nothing
we can do about it.

00:30:50,267 --> 00:30:51,701
We have to go back
to the body.

00:30:51,768 --> 00:30:52,936
Right.

00:30:53,003 --> 00:30:54,237
There's always
a clue

00:30:54,304 --> 00:30:56,740
except we don't
have a body.

00:30:56,807 --> 00:30:59,910
We have bones.

00:31:11,588 --> 00:31:13,089
I'll take it
to Greg.

00:31:13,156 --> 00:31:16,560
Skeletal muscle of Mel Bennett.

00:31:16,626 --> 00:31:17,961
It goes in...

00:31:24,468 --> 00:31:25,869
Contents come out.

00:31:25,936 --> 00:31:27,804
In 30 seconds--

00:31:27,871 --> 00:31:29,139
Bioassay.

00:31:29,206 --> 00:31:30,807
I like saying
that word.

00:31:30,874 --> 00:31:32,242
Bioassay.

00:31:32,309 --> 00:31:33,243
Sounds Nubian.

00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:34,911
So how are you?

00:31:34,978 --> 00:31:36,646
Never better.

00:31:36,713 --> 00:31:38,081
Yeah? Well,
you look good.

00:31:38,148 --> 00:31:39,282
I try.

00:31:39,349 --> 00:31:41,751
Yeah. I heard Grissom's
lady friend was in town.

00:31:41,818 --> 00:31:43,854
Lady friend? Hmm. Wouldn't know
anything about that.

00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,522
Really? I thought you
and Grissom were tight.

00:31:45,589 --> 00:31:47,491
We are.
( <i>machine noise</i> )

00:31:47,557 --> 00:31:49,559
Okay. Got it. Private.

00:31:54,564 --> 00:31:56,032
Huh. Digoxin.

00:31:56,099 --> 00:31:58,435
Digoxin?

00:31:58,502 --> 00:32:00,203
It's supposed to treat
heart failure

00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:02,139
but not if you're taking
the amount found

00:32:02,205 --> 00:32:03,840
in Mel Bennett's bones.

00:32:03,907 --> 00:32:05,742
She poisoned him.

00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:09,012
Someone did.

00:32:15,085 --> 00:32:17,854
We know your husband had
an overdose in his system.

00:32:19,589 --> 00:32:22,125
We found it
in his bone tissue.

00:32:22,192 --> 00:32:24,628
WILLOWS:
Did you kill him

00:32:24,694 --> 00:32:26,029
for his pension checks?

00:32:26,096 --> 00:32:27,230
Don't answer that question.

00:32:27,297 --> 00:32:28,298
It's okay.

00:32:28,365 --> 00:32:31,034
Mel took those pills himself.

00:32:32,702 --> 00:32:36,573
He asked me to leave the house
so he could do it.

00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,941
So, now it's suicide.

00:32:38,008 --> 00:32:41,344
He was dying
from the heart trouble.

00:32:41,411 --> 00:32:43,413
He was in chronic pain.

00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,581
He asked me

00:32:44,648 --> 00:32:45,682
to get it over with.

00:32:45,749 --> 00:32:47,684
I couldn't.

00:32:47,751 --> 00:32:50,253
I loved him.

00:32:52,289 --> 00:32:54,391
This is the part that I'm having
a hard time with.

00:32:54,458 --> 00:32:56,993
You were able to cut him up

00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:59,262
when you realized
you couldn't

00:32:59,329 --> 00:33:00,897
afford the burial.

00:33:00,964 --> 00:33:04,167
I lied about <i>why.</i>

00:33:04,234 --> 00:33:05,936
Mrs. Bennett, don't...
No.

00:33:06,002 --> 00:33:07,270
Let me talk.

00:33:07,337 --> 00:33:11,074
Mel made me promise
to hide his body

00:33:11,141 --> 00:33:12,776
so I wouldn't lose

00:33:12,843 --> 00:33:15,212
his social security benefits.

00:33:15,278 --> 00:33:18,048
Because a wife's benefits
are cut in half

00:33:18,114 --> 00:33:20,183
when the husband dies.

00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:21,785
Yes.

00:33:21,852 --> 00:33:25,122
Even if you've spent
50 years by his side--

00:33:25,188 --> 00:33:27,224
packing his lunch

00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:30,193
pressing his work pants.

00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:34,898
Mel was my whole life.

00:33:34,965 --> 00:33:37,567
I didn't kill him.

00:33:37,634 --> 00:33:42,639
I couldn't even put him out
of his misery.

00:33:49,813 --> 00:33:52,249
So what do you think, Jim?

00:33:52,315 --> 00:33:53,617
I don't know.
You're the lab guys.

00:33:53,683 --> 00:33:54,985
What is the evidence
telling you?

00:33:55,051 --> 00:33:57,854
Forensically, we can't prove
if Mel took the digoxin overdose

00:33:57,921 --> 00:34:00,323
or if she forced it on him.

00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:02,793
So that leaves us
with one choice.

00:34:02,859 --> 00:34:05,328
Equivocal evidence.

00:34:05,395 --> 00:34:06,463
Golden rule.

00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:08,098
Ah.

00:34:08,165 --> 00:34:09,499
Well, "When faced with evidence

00:34:09,566 --> 00:34:12,235
"that can equally exonerate
or implicate a suspect, we must

00:34:12,302 --> 00:34:14,738
"as objective
interpreters
of that evidence...

00:34:14,805 --> 00:34:16,807
side with the defendant."

00:34:16,873 --> 00:34:18,275
Tie goes to the brother.

00:34:18,341 --> 00:34:20,811
Rose goes free.

00:34:20,877 --> 00:34:22,979
We'll never prove
who administered the fatal dose.

00:34:23,046 --> 00:34:26,316
I don't think she did it.

00:34:26,383 --> 00:34:28,218
Okay, then.

00:34:28,285 --> 00:34:29,686
I guess I'm out of here.

00:34:29,753 --> 00:34:31,188
I'll go start my paperwork.

00:34:31,254 --> 00:34:34,191
See you.

00:34:34,257 --> 00:34:36,092
Okay, so, I was wrong.

00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,594
It wasn't murder.

00:34:37,661 --> 00:34:39,930
It's not a contest.

00:34:39,996 --> 00:34:41,531
You want to go
in with me?

00:34:41,598 --> 00:34:43,533
Give her the
good news?

00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,601
Could you do it?

00:34:44,668 --> 00:34:47,204
I'm sort of late
for a dinner.

00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:49,206
Sure.

00:34:49,272 --> 00:34:52,676
Thanks.

00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:09,793
So, ladies of the wedding party,
you get a free course

00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:12,028
in the forensics
of sexual intercourse.

00:35:12,095 --> 00:35:13,797
Secrets of our trade.

00:35:13,864 --> 00:35:17,400
Lynn, when you had your exam
for sexual assault

00:35:17,467 --> 00:35:19,569
a SART nurse makes a chart
like this.

00:35:23,807 --> 00:35:25,842
This is the vagina.

00:35:27,544 --> 00:35:29,379
And it <i>does</i> tell a monologue.

00:35:29,446 --> 00:35:31,548
Some bruising is normal

00:35:31,615 --> 00:35:33,416
when sex occurs.

00:35:33,483 --> 00:35:35,218
Injuries at 11...

00:35:35,285 --> 00:35:39,689
12, or 1:00,
indicate consensual sex

00:35:39,756 --> 00:35:41,391
or what we would call "avid."

00:35:41,458 --> 00:35:43,593
Injuries around
the dinner hour...

00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:48,198
Five, six, or seven,
indicate forced entry.

00:35:48,265 --> 00:35:50,667
The woman hasn't done anything
to help her partner

00:35:50,734 --> 00:35:52,602
thus sustaining
serious bruising.

00:35:52,669 --> 00:35:56,907
Sidle, I'm going to be
just outside the door.

00:35:56,973 --> 00:35:58,141
Okay, O'Riley.

00:36:00,777 --> 00:36:02,212
Lynn...

00:36:02,279 --> 00:36:04,948
Your exam

00:36:05,015 --> 00:36:07,884
showed no evidence of sex
in the last 48 hours.

00:36:07,951 --> 00:36:08,952
Actually, in months.

00:36:10,654 --> 00:36:12,289
( <i>snickers</i> )

00:36:12,355 --> 00:36:14,391
But the epithelials indicate

00:36:14,458 --> 00:36:16,927
that Darren had sex
right before he died.

00:36:16,993 --> 00:36:19,129
And the coroner puts
time of death

00:36:19,196 --> 00:36:21,631
when you've all admitted
to being present.

00:36:21,698 --> 00:36:23,433
So...

00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,268
Meg?

00:36:26,636 --> 00:36:28,905
Joyce?

00:36:32,309 --> 00:36:35,745
Look, we can run the clock exam
on each of you.

00:36:35,812 --> 00:36:38,748
And the clock is going
to tell us what happened.

00:36:40,984 --> 00:36:42,919
So who wants to go first?

00:36:45,856 --> 00:36:49,426
I had sex with Darren.

00:36:51,862 --> 00:36:54,131
And it wasn't rape.

00:36:54,197 --> 00:36:58,502
MEG:
Darren had been flirting with me
all night

00:36:58,568 --> 00:37:01,238
and when it was time to leave

00:37:01,304 --> 00:37:05,909
I told the other girls
to wait in the car.

00:37:05,976 --> 00:37:07,777
I know it's crazy

00:37:07,844 --> 00:37:10,113
but I thought...

00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:12,182
I'm in Vegas.

00:37:12,249 --> 00:37:14,684
It doesn't really count.

00:37:25,195 --> 00:37:26,129
And...

00:37:26,196 --> 00:37:30,167
Then I don't know
what happened.

00:37:30,233 --> 00:37:33,370
<i>I saw my engagement ring.</i>

00:37:33,436 --> 00:37:37,107
Then I-I thought about Luke

00:37:37,174 --> 00:37:41,011
and how he trusts me.

00:37:41,077 --> 00:37:43,180
I don't think
this is right.

00:37:43,246 --> 00:37:44,714
Oh, you like it a little rough.

00:37:44,781 --> 00:37:46,750
<i>I tried to push Darren of me...</i>
Okay.

00:37:46,817 --> 00:37:48,018
We can do that.

00:37:48,084 --> 00:37:50,787
<i>But I-I don't think</i>
<i>it got through.</i>

00:37:50,854 --> 00:37:53,490
He wouldn't stop.

00:37:55,091 --> 00:37:58,428
As soon as I hit him
with the lamp, I knew.

00:37:58,495 --> 00:38:01,698
WARRICK:
<i>So you only hit him once?</i>

00:38:01,765 --> 00:38:04,468
Mm-hmm.

00:38:08,505 --> 00:38:12,509
I didn't mean to kill him.

00:38:12,576 --> 00:38:15,645
Meg, your engagement ring...

00:38:15,712 --> 00:38:18,849
Is that a cubic zirconia?

00:38:18,915 --> 00:38:21,818
No, it's a real diamond.

00:38:21,885 --> 00:38:25,021
My fiancÃÂ© wanted me
to have the best.

00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:29,025
Does your fiancÃÂ© have
a zirconia ring?

00:38:29,092 --> 00:38:32,129
Zirconia studded.

00:38:34,431 --> 00:38:36,466
It's a promise ring.

00:38:36,533 --> 00:38:41,371
He told me to save my money...

00:38:41,438 --> 00:38:43,874
for our honeymoon.

00:38:47,077 --> 00:38:48,211
Damaged?

00:38:48,278 --> 00:38:50,213
No, my ring is fine.

00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,448
May we see it?

00:39:03,059 --> 00:39:05,595
You were in that motel room
that night, weren't you, Luke?

00:39:05,662 --> 00:39:07,931
I don't know
what you're talking about.

00:39:07,998 --> 00:39:09,366
What happened?
You got wind of the party?

00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,169
( <i>groans</i> ):
I don't know
where she is.

00:39:12,235 --> 00:39:13,170
Let her go!

00:39:13,236 --> 00:39:14,671
Your husband told me
you were here.

00:39:14,738 --> 00:39:15,872
Now tell me where she is.

00:39:15,939 --> 00:39:16,940
Let go of me.

00:39:17,007 --> 00:39:18,208
Just give me the room number.

00:39:18,275 --> 00:39:19,509
Tell me where she is.

00:39:19,576 --> 00:39:22,245
Bruised up Lynn's wrists.

00:39:24,447 --> 00:39:26,049
Meg, you did have sex
with Darren

00:39:26,116 --> 00:39:27,250
the dancer.

00:39:27,317 --> 00:39:28,351
Maybe you even

00:39:28,418 --> 00:39:30,353
tried to stop
in the middle of it.

00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:32,856
But something
got your attention.

00:39:32,923 --> 00:39:36,560
I don't think this is right.

00:39:36,626 --> 00:39:38,395
MEG:
Oh, my God!

00:39:38,462 --> 00:39:39,463
Luke.

00:39:39,529 --> 00:39:42,432
( <i>glass breaking</i> )

00:39:42,499 --> 00:39:46,002
Luke, you threw the lamp--
probably on the floor.

00:39:46,069 --> 00:39:48,071
Understandable rage.

00:39:49,706 --> 00:39:52,042
You did what any guy
in your position would do.

00:39:52,108 --> 00:39:53,577
( <i>screaming</i> )

00:39:53,643 --> 00:39:56,012
But you didn't stop
with one hit.

00:40:01,685 --> 00:40:05,088
And you didn't know that you had
lost a piece of your ring.

00:40:07,157 --> 00:40:08,692
Except we found it.

00:40:16,733 --> 00:40:19,703
Honey, I'm sorry.

00:40:26,676 --> 00:40:27,611
We just...

00:40:27,677 --> 00:40:30,914
We just were hoping
we could get married.

00:40:30,981 --> 00:40:33,383
Put it all behind us.

00:40:39,656 --> 00:40:43,026
Laws don't end
when you come to Vegas.

00:41:02,913 --> 00:41:04,981
( <i>laughing</i> )

00:41:05,048 --> 00:41:08,118
I'm surprised.

00:41:08,185 --> 00:41:10,120
I'm having a nice time.

00:41:10,187 --> 00:41:12,656
Were you expecting
a bad time?

00:41:12,722 --> 00:41:15,926
No. I just thought

00:41:15,992 --> 00:41:18,295
we might be uncomfortable
away from work.

00:41:18,361 --> 00:41:21,731
Are you?

00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,168
No.

00:41:26,603 --> 00:41:28,071
Nor am I.

00:41:28,138 --> 00:41:29,506
Good.

00:41:29,573 --> 00:41:31,274
It's kind of like
that old saying.

00:41:31,341 --> 00:41:32,876
"How a person does
one thing is...

00:41:32,943 --> 00:41:34,711
...how a person
does everything."

00:41:34,778 --> 00:41:35,712
Exactly.

00:41:38,148 --> 00:41:41,051
( <i>beeping</i> )

00:41:41,118 --> 00:41:43,186
Excuse me.
Sure.

00:41:52,062 --> 00:41:54,264
What's going on?

00:41:54,331 --> 00:41:56,266
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:41:56,333 --> 00:41:57,734
They found two bodies

00:41:57,801 --> 00:42:00,337
in a crack den
at the end of the strip.

00:42:00,403 --> 00:42:01,872
Evidently, they've been

00:42:01,938 --> 00:42:03,740
dead a while.

00:42:03,807 --> 00:42:07,277
They need me
to do an insect analysis ASAP.

00:42:07,344 --> 00:42:09,579
Oh.

00:42:11,314 --> 00:42:13,350
Well...

00:42:13,416 --> 00:42:15,385
you are the bug guy.

00:42:15,452 --> 00:42:18,255
Yeah.

00:42:20,957 --> 00:42:23,693
But I asked you
to postpone your flight.

00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,630
It's okay.

00:42:26,696 --> 00:42:28,999
It happens.

00:42:30,967 --> 00:42:32,435
Maybe I can...

00:42:32,502 --> 00:42:34,704
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

00:42:37,407 --> 00:42:39,476
I'm sorry.

00:42:43,547 --> 00:42:44,648
Yeah. Grissom.

00:42:44,714 --> 00:42:47,684
All right, look...

00:42:47,751 --> 00:42:49,219
make sure the paramedics
don't leave

00:42:49,286 --> 00:42:51,221
and have the primary
on the scene

00:42:51,288 --> 00:42:53,290
take photographs of the corpses

00:42:53,356 --> 00:42:55,358
at two minute intervals
until I arrive.

00:42:55,425 --> 00:42:57,828
All right?
