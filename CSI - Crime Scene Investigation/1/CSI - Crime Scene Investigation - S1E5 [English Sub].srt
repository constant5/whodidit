00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,502
Maggots.

00:00:32,568 --> 00:00:34,604
This kid's been here a while.

00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,681
No gunshot wounds.

00:00:45,748 --> 00:00:46,682
No stab marks.

00:00:46,749 --> 00:00:48,818
No signs of strangulation.

00:00:48,885 --> 00:00:51,621
It's a long way out
in the sticks just to drop dead.

00:00:55,691 --> 00:00:57,760
Not if you're being chased.

00:00:59,128 --> 00:01:02,365
Look at the foot patterns
leading up to the body.

00:01:02,432 --> 00:01:04,901
See the strides?

00:01:04,967 --> 00:01:08,071
This kid was running.

00:01:08,137 --> 00:01:10,339
See the left
foot impression?

00:01:10,406 --> 00:01:11,774
It's straight; that's normal.

00:01:11,841 --> 00:01:15,111
But look at the right foot
impression.

00:01:15,178 --> 00:01:17,113
It's turned outward.

00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,948
Almost 90 degrees.

00:01:19,015 --> 00:01:21,751
He was looking over his shoulder
when he was running.

00:01:21,818 --> 00:01:23,886
Think there was
somebody else here?

00:01:26,355 --> 00:01:29,025
Based on these prints,
it's hard to tell.

00:01:29,092 --> 00:01:32,595
Can I get this
taped off here?

00:01:34,197 --> 00:01:35,665
So you want
to call it?

00:01:35,731 --> 00:01:38,334
How do you think he died?

00:01:41,671 --> 00:01:44,407
Fear.

00:01:44,474 --> 00:01:48,244
Someone chased this kid

00:02:43,275 --> 00:02:46,245
Yes, I did.

00:02:46,312 --> 00:02:47,613
Thank you.

00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,615
Hey, you want to give us
our assignments

00:02:49,682 --> 00:02:51,784
or do you want us
to take... the night off?

00:02:51,851 --> 00:02:53,386
Paperwork,

00:02:53,452 --> 00:02:56,055
paper clips, paper-punchers--
all these people want me to do

00:02:56,122 --> 00:02:58,190
is push paper; nobody wants me
to solve crimes.

00:02:58,257 --> 00:03:00,893
Hey, you could've
turned the job down.

00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,096
Yeah, the grass is always
greener, Catherine.

00:03:04,163 --> 00:03:06,265
Well let's just
hurry this up.

00:03:08,267 --> 00:03:09,402
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:03:09,468 --> 00:03:10,536
Cool.

00:03:10,603 --> 00:03:12,805
You really want to
see flash paper flash?

00:03:12,872 --> 00:03:14,140
Walk in on a bookie.

00:03:14,206 --> 00:03:16,275
That's what this was
about, bookies.

( <i>ringing continues</i> )

00:03:26,252 --> 00:03:27,753
Warrick, you and I are
on the 419

00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,155
our dead body in the desert.

00:03:29,221 --> 00:03:31,991
Sara, dead body of your own.
Dumpsite out near Henderson.

00:03:32,058 --> 00:03:33,325
Oh, I'll dress down.

00:03:33,392 --> 00:03:35,995
Catherine, Verbum Dei Charter
School. 420 homicide.

00:03:36,062 --> 00:03:38,097
The school dean was killed
in his office.

00:03:38,164 --> 00:03:40,366
Suspect called it in;
could be self-defense.

00:03:40,433 --> 00:03:42,501
Did some kid off him
with a silver spoon?

00:03:42,568 --> 00:03:43,836
Suspect's not a kid.

00:03:43,903 --> 00:03:45,838
It's the woman
who founded the school.

00:03:45,905 --> 00:03:47,506
Take Nicky with you.

00:03:47,573 --> 00:03:48,841
Where is he?

00:03:48,908 --> 00:03:50,176
Here I am.

00:03:50,242 --> 00:03:51,510
You're coming with me.

00:03:51,577 --> 00:03:52,645
Glad you could make it.

00:03:52,712 --> 00:03:54,814
I'm outta here.
Good luck tonight, you guys.

00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,881
See you.

00:03:55,948 --> 00:03:57,149
Can't make a ruling?

00:03:57,216 --> 00:03:59,819
Look at the bruise marks
on John Doe here.

00:03:59,885 --> 00:04:01,387
I call that suffocation.

00:04:01,454 --> 00:04:02,788
Not necessarily.

00:04:02,855 --> 00:04:05,791
It could be the result
of his face impacting the ground

00:04:05,858 --> 00:04:07,126
at expiration.

00:04:07,193 --> 00:04:08,794
I'm going to take a mouth swab.

00:04:08,861 --> 00:04:09,795
Go ahead.

00:04:09,862 --> 00:04:11,464
Grissom, I have something
to show you.

00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:13,733
You know, when a kid
this young drops dead

00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:15,835
smart money chases
anesthetics, alcohol

00:04:15,901 --> 00:04:17,803
methanol, maybe even
a little Freon.

00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,071
I've got to be honest.

00:04:19,138 --> 00:04:21,707
I've had a lot of dead
bodies from the desert

00:04:21,774 --> 00:04:23,209
and when they're out
there too long

00:04:23,275 --> 00:04:25,044
the elements tend
to eat away the evidence.

00:04:25,111 --> 00:04:26,345
My opinion is,
you are looking

00:04:26,412 --> 00:04:27,913
at the picture
of health, internally.

00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:31,917
Externally,
it's another matter.

00:04:31,984 --> 00:04:34,120
Skin sample.

00:04:37,022 --> 00:04:38,791
Grissom:
This kid was dry as a bone.

00:04:38,858 --> 00:04:41,494
From exposure?

00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,796
The skin's not consistent
with elemental damage.

00:04:43,863 --> 00:04:45,264
Warrick told me
what you said

00:04:45,331 --> 00:04:47,333
about the cause of death
being fear.

00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,935
I never read about that
in any medical book.

00:04:50,002 --> 00:04:51,804
Try the <i>Forensic Medical</i>
<i>Journal.</i>

00:04:51,871 --> 00:04:53,973
Read the four canons on cause
of death:

00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:56,809
Homicide, suicide, natural,
and unexplained.

00:04:56,876 --> 00:05:00,012
Talks about fear
in the last part
of "unexplained."

00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:01,480
I had to ask.

00:05:01,547 --> 00:05:03,015
You want to know
what killed this kid?

00:05:03,082 --> 00:05:04,016
Benihana the maggots.

00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:05,951
What the maggots?

00:05:06,018 --> 00:05:08,087
Tox the maggots we found
on the victim.

00:05:08,154 --> 00:05:09,922
Whatever he ingested

00:05:09,989 --> 00:05:11,857
has probably evaporated
from the sun.

00:05:11,924 --> 00:05:14,326
But the maggots are
like little refrigerators.

00:05:14,393 --> 00:05:17,329
They preserve what we digest
for longer periods of time.

00:05:17,396 --> 00:05:19,598
Entomology is our friend.

00:05:19,665 --> 00:05:21,300
Yes.

00:05:25,271 --> 00:05:28,240
Sorry, little buddy.

00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:31,310
Scalpel.

00:05:31,377 --> 00:05:34,947
My name is Paul
and this is between y'all.

00:05:35,014 --> 00:05:36,982
Talk about <i>Pulp Fiction.</i>

00:05:41,554 --> 00:05:43,522
It's all yours, Doc.

00:05:46,325 --> 00:05:48,360
Fire up that
gas chromatograph

00:05:48,427 --> 00:05:50,696
mass spectrometer thing,
will you?

00:05:50,763 --> 00:05:53,232
No problem, son.

00:05:59,138 --> 00:06:01,807
15 seconds till pay dirt.

00:06:01,874 --> 00:06:02,875
Cool.

00:06:02,942 --> 00:06:04,310
Play any pigskin, man?

00:06:04,376 --> 00:06:05,845
No, I'm off that.

00:06:05,911 --> 00:06:07,646
It's prime time for you.

00:06:07,713 --> 00:06:09,315
I haven't made a bet
in a month.

00:06:09,382 --> 00:06:11,684
I can't say I don't have
that itch, though.

00:06:15,855 --> 00:06:17,957
Hmm. Haven't seen
this stuff for a while.

00:06:18,023 --> 00:06:19,091
What's that?

00:06:19,158 --> 00:06:20,593
Jimsonweed.

00:06:33,739 --> 00:06:35,975
Do you have a name?

00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:38,844
She's not exactly carrying
a purse.

00:06:41,647 --> 00:06:42,815
Oh...

00:06:46,752 --> 00:06:49,522
( <i>camera shutter clicking</i> )

00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,826
Okay, let's take her out.

00:06:56,996 --> 00:06:58,631
Thanks.

00:06:58,697 --> 00:06:59,832
Sure.

00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:10,709
That's strange.

00:07:10,776 --> 00:07:12,044
What's that?

00:07:12,111 --> 00:07:14,113
Glazed like a doughnut.

00:07:16,515 --> 00:07:18,384
Well, here's the reason
the skin was funny.

00:07:18,451 --> 00:07:19,618
Formaldehyde, right?

00:07:19,685 --> 00:07:20,953
Close. BioTone Arterial.

00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,254
Promotes high diffusion

00:07:22,321 --> 00:07:24,056
and fast drainage
in skin tissue.

00:07:24,123 --> 00:07:26,459
So I was right.
This woman's
been embalmed.

00:07:26,525 --> 00:07:29,495
Yeah. Yeah, I already
ran her prints

00:07:29,562 --> 00:07:33,199
through work-hire;
got her I.D. right here.

00:07:33,265 --> 00:07:35,634
I, uh, I just want
to say I-I...

00:07:35,701 --> 00:07:37,069
Well, I really admire
the gusto

00:07:37,136 --> 00:07:38,637
with which you approach
your job.

00:07:38,704 --> 00:07:41,974
Are you hitting on me, David?

00:07:44,043 --> 00:07:45,811
Uh...

00:07:45,878 --> 00:07:47,213
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,949
Let me give you
some friendly advice.

00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:52,818
If you want to pull chicks,
you've got to get aggressive.

00:07:52,885 --> 00:07:54,920
You've gotta drop
the glasses

00:07:54,987 --> 00:07:56,389
lose the coat

00:07:56,455 --> 00:07:57,923
grow some scruff.

00:07:59,825 --> 00:08:03,129
You do get a "C" for cute,
though.

00:08:05,064 --> 00:08:06,665

I got it.

Man, check out
all that blood spatter.

Yeah, blows to the head,
up close and personal.

00:08:49,141 --> 00:08:51,477
A lot of passion
around this one.

00:08:51,544 --> 00:08:53,979
Any suspects?

00:08:54,046 --> 00:08:56,649
Kate Armstrong.
Founded the school.

00:08:56,716 --> 00:09:00,586
She called 911 herself.
She says he attacked her.

00:09:00,653 --> 00:09:02,755
She's out in the hallway.

00:09:08,961 --> 00:09:10,296
He wouldn't let go of me.

00:09:10,362 --> 00:09:11,630
He kept pawing.

00:09:11,697 --> 00:09:13,733
I can still smell
his aftershave.

00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:16,135
( <i>sobbing</i> ):
I mean...

00:09:16,202 --> 00:09:18,070
It's all a blur.

00:09:18,137 --> 00:09:21,640
I grabbed the closest thing
I could and I hit him with it.

00:09:21,707 --> 00:09:23,709
A rock?

00:09:23,776 --> 00:09:25,010
I don't know
what it was.

00:09:25,077 --> 00:09:27,346
I didn't care.
I just wanted
him off of me.

00:09:27,413 --> 00:09:28,814
How many times did you hit him?

00:09:28,881 --> 00:09:30,216
Once.

00:09:32,918 --> 00:09:34,687
What's the matter?

00:09:34,754 --> 00:09:36,055
Come on. No one's
going to hear.

00:09:36,122 --> 00:09:38,758
Everyone's in class.
Where's the harm?

00:09:38,824 --> 00:09:40,659
I said get off of me!

00:09:40,726 --> 00:09:43,229
Miss Armstrong...

00:09:43,295 --> 00:09:46,499
were you and the dean having
a personal relationship?

00:09:46,565 --> 00:09:48,167
No.

00:09:48,234 --> 00:09:50,870
No, Vernon's a pig.

00:09:50,936 --> 00:09:52,938
Then why did you hire him?

00:09:53,005 --> 00:09:54,740
You founded the school.

00:09:54,807 --> 00:09:57,243
It's your integrity
on the line.

00:09:57,309 --> 00:09:59,311
He's great at raising money.

00:09:59,378 --> 00:10:02,314
His donor list is huge.

00:10:03,849 --> 00:10:06,419
I didn't mean to kill him.

00:10:06,485 --> 00:10:08,788
( <i>sniffling</i> )

00:10:08,854 --> 00:10:12,224
I just wanted him
to leave me alone.

00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:14,894
But you hit him
more than once.

00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,096
Oh, who knows. I...

00:10:17,163 --> 00:10:19,498
Well, you hit a man once,
there's no blood.

00:10:19,565 --> 00:10:21,167
The first hit's free.

00:10:21,233 --> 00:10:22,735
You hit him
more than that...

00:10:22,802 --> 00:10:24,003
( <i>clears throat</i> )

00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:26,305
The walls in his office
look like the dean

00:10:26,372 --> 00:10:28,340
went a couple rounds
with Mike Tyson.

00:10:28,407 --> 00:10:31,210
Then I hit him more than once.

00:10:31,277 --> 00:10:34,513
Like I said, I just...

00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:38,017
I wanted him off me.

00:10:38,084 --> 00:10:41,287
Will you excuse me?

00:10:41,353 --> 00:10:44,657
Officer. Thanks.

00:10:46,592 --> 00:10:48,194
What'd you find out?

00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,362
Heavy on B.S.;
zippo on truth.

00:10:50,429 --> 00:10:52,164
You don't seem
too bummed about it.

00:10:52,231 --> 00:10:53,365
Hell, no, I'm stoked.

00:10:53,432 --> 00:10:55,835
( <i>sotto voce</i> ):
We drew the best
case, Nicky.

00:10:55,901 --> 00:10:57,069
I can feel it.

00:10:57,136 --> 00:10:58,671
Mm-hmm.

00:10:58,738 --> 00:11:00,806
Then there's
only one thing left to do.

00:11:00,873 --> 00:11:01,907
String it.

00:11:01,974 --> 00:11:03,209
String it.

00:11:03,275 --> 00:11:05,411
I've never filed a missing
person's report before.

00:11:05,478 --> 00:11:07,880
But I'm getting
concerned about Eric.

00:11:07,947 --> 00:11:11,117
Where was the last place
you saw your friend?

00:11:11,183 --> 00:11:12,451
After work, we went out.

00:11:12,518 --> 00:11:13,619
You two work together?

00:11:13,686 --> 00:11:14,820
No, a few blocks apart.

00:11:14,887 --> 00:11:16,822
I'm over at Voosh's,
you know?

00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:17,990
Voosh's Fireworks

00:11:18,057 --> 00:11:20,960
and he's at Element Sound,
the music store.

00:11:21,026 --> 00:11:22,328
You guys go into the desert?

00:11:22,395 --> 00:11:24,296
Yeah, a party out near Red Rock.

00:11:24,363 --> 00:11:25,965
How'd you know?

00:11:26,031 --> 00:11:27,967
You just told us.

00:11:28,033 --> 00:11:29,301
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:11:29,368 --> 00:11:30,936
So spill it.

00:11:31,003 --> 00:11:35,207
We, uh, drank a couple beers

00:11:35,274 --> 00:11:36,375
hung out, and...

00:11:36,442 --> 00:11:39,678
then I just lost track of him
around midnight

00:11:39,745 --> 00:11:41,113
and I haven't
seen him since.

00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,015
Did you guys drop
anything that night?

00:11:43,082 --> 00:11:44,383
Ecstasy, crystal, G...?

00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:45,384
No.

00:11:45,451 --> 00:11:47,186
No way.

00:11:47,253 --> 00:11:51,524
Look, do you, do you know
where Eric is or not?

00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:53,659
Bobby, we found a body

00:11:53,726 --> 00:11:57,263
that matches your description
of Eric.

00:11:57,329 --> 00:12:01,000
Would you be willing
to identify him?

00:12:01,067 --> 00:12:03,903
Is this your friend?

00:12:05,905 --> 00:12:09,141
( <i>crying</i> )

00:12:13,312 --> 00:12:16,615
Oh, God...

00:12:18,984 --> 00:12:21,921
What happened to you, Eric?

00:12:21,987 --> 00:12:23,456
Oh, God...

00:12:23,522 --> 00:12:26,092
( <i>knocking</i> )

00:12:26,158 --> 00:12:28,627
Hey, boss.
I got something for you.

00:12:34,233 --> 00:12:37,036
( <i>sotto voce</i> ):
I did this whole
tox-the-maggots thing

00:12:37,103 --> 00:12:38,037
like you said.

00:12:38,104 --> 00:12:40,106
Found jimsonweed
in their blood.

00:12:40,172 --> 00:12:42,007
Which means?

00:12:42,074 --> 00:12:44,110
Jimsonweed in Eric's blood.

00:12:44,176 --> 00:12:45,444
Jimsonweed.

00:12:45,511 --> 00:12:48,180
"Dry as a bone,
red as a beet

00:12:48,247 --> 00:12:51,350
blind as a bat,
mad as a hatter."

00:12:51,417 --> 00:12:54,253
Really?
Cite your sources.

00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,423
Internet insomnia.

00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:00,393
But Brass just said
they weren't doing any drugs.

00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,822
Yeah.

00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:05,570
Blood spatter on northwest wall.

00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:09,241
Blood sprays northeast corner
above...

00:14:11,943 --> 00:14:14,313
Wow.

00:14:16,114 --> 00:14:18,717
Now, there's a look
I like to see-- confusion.

00:14:18,784 --> 00:14:19,985
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:14:20,052 --> 00:14:22,020
No, I'm not confused.

00:14:22,087 --> 00:14:23,689
X marks the spot.

00:14:23,755 --> 00:14:24,923
A blow here...

00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:27,793
here... and here.

00:14:27,859 --> 00:14:29,895
Our dean received
the majority of blows

00:14:29,962 --> 00:14:31,096
when he was on the ground.

00:14:31,163 --> 00:14:32,130
Cast-off from the weapon

00:14:32,197 --> 00:14:33,765
against the window.
Mm-hmm.

00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:36,401
The back wall...

00:14:37,703 --> 00:14:40,305
Void... against the back wall.

00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:44,977
The floor under the body?

00:14:45,043 --> 00:14:46,311
The blood spatter has a void

00:14:46,378 --> 00:14:48,046
instead of one continuous line
of spray.

00:14:48,113 --> 00:14:49,281
There's an interruption

00:14:49,348 --> 00:14:52,317
a space where something
or someone comes between

00:14:52,384 --> 00:14:55,721
the blood coming off
the body and the wall.

00:14:55,787 --> 00:14:57,556
Which means our assailant
was here and...

00:14:57,623 --> 00:15:01,293
There was somebody else
in this room.

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,895
Kate Armstrong is lying.

00:15:03,962 --> 00:15:07,099
Fruit juice, half ice.

00:15:07,165 --> 00:15:09,601
Thanks, Warrick.

00:15:09,668 --> 00:15:13,372
The guy said it was natural,
that it wasn't a drug.

00:15:13,438 --> 00:15:16,675
I mean, jimsonweed is a plant.

00:15:16,742 --> 00:15:19,111
Most drugs derive from plants.

00:15:19,177 --> 00:15:20,445
That doesn't make them safe.

00:15:20,512 --> 00:15:22,748
Or legal, for that matter.

00:15:22,814 --> 00:15:24,516
Yeah, but he said it was safe.

00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:25,917
That's why we bought it.

00:15:25,984 --> 00:15:27,853
Did you take the drug, too?

00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:31,657
Yeah. We both did.

00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:34,693
You drink it. It's a tea.

00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,695
Who sold you this "tea"?

00:15:36,762 --> 00:15:39,131
He didn't give a name.

00:15:39,197 --> 00:15:40,599
He just...

00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:43,335
He told us that j-weed
would be a cool high.

00:15:43,402 --> 00:15:45,704
Mind-expanding.

00:15:45,771 --> 00:15:49,908
I mean, that's the whole point
of a rave is to experiment.

00:15:49,975 --> 00:15:52,144
Did you get a stamp
when you got in?

00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:54,179
Yeah. But that was like
four days ago.

00:15:54,246 --> 00:15:56,648
Well, mostly they use
water-resistant pads

00:15:56,715 --> 00:15:58,650
so you don't sweat it off.

00:15:58,717 --> 00:16:00,085
Could you hit the lights, Gris?

00:16:02,554 --> 00:16:04,256
Where'd they stamp you?

00:16:06,992 --> 00:16:08,827
Yeah, that's
DJMasterband's stamp.

00:16:08,894 --> 00:16:11,563
He is the spinner
in Vegas right now.

00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,231
Must've been playing
at the rave

00:16:13,298 --> 00:16:15,300
these two were at.

00:16:16,535 --> 00:16:19,871
Is there any way for us
to track this, uh, DJ person?

00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:21,807
The free papers, yeah.

00:16:21,873 --> 00:16:23,408
They have ads
for all sorts of raves.

00:16:23,475 --> 00:16:24,543
Bobby?

00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:25,777
Would you be able

00:16:25,844 --> 00:16:27,913
to recognize the guy
who sold you the jimson?

00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:30,215
Definitely.

00:16:33,018 --> 00:16:37,189
No one in the mortuary business
likes to discuss the issue

00:16:37,255 --> 00:16:39,925
but it does exist:
people rob graves.

00:16:39,992 --> 00:16:41,627
Are you telling me
that someone dug up

00:16:41,693 --> 00:16:43,195
Stephanie Reyes
and stole her body?

00:16:43,261 --> 00:16:46,298
They do it for gold, trinkets,
or just kicks.

00:16:46,365 --> 00:16:48,133
You should hear what
I hear at conventions.

00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,468
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:16:49,534 --> 00:16:51,470
Did you report the robbery

00:16:51,536 --> 00:16:53,772
of Mrs. Reyes' remains
to the police?

00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,808
As I say, we try not
to discuss the issue

00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:57,909
outside of the community.

00:16:57,976 --> 00:17:01,346
Profits over people,
is that it?

00:17:01,413 --> 00:17:03,949
I wouldn't put
it like that.

00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,062
Eight feet.

00:17:17,129 --> 00:17:19,564
How deep do you
bury these caskets?

00:17:19,631 --> 00:17:21,566
Well...

00:17:21,633 --> 00:17:22,868
There's nothing else
in there.

00:17:22,934 --> 00:17:26,505
I thought you said
grave robbers
only stole bodies.

00:17:26,571 --> 00:17:28,473
This might've been
an inlaid casket

00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:33,345
something of value
that people would steal.

00:17:33,412 --> 00:17:35,414
You sell caskets, right?

00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,616
As part of your
mortuary service?

00:17:37,683 --> 00:17:39,685
I want to see some.

00:17:39,751 --> 00:17:42,754
I can arrange a viewing.

00:17:42,821 --> 00:17:45,090
Bonus.

00:17:54,366 --> 00:17:55,701
( <i>knocking</i> )

00:17:55,767 --> 00:17:57,936
Gris, I got the prelims back

00:17:58,003 --> 00:18:01,273
on that swab I took
off of our desert guy.

00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,474
And?

00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:06,178
Products found
in mouth and nose:

00:18:06,244 --> 00:18:10,015
mentholated nose spray,
patchouli and aluminum.

00:18:10,082 --> 00:18:11,583
Nose spray?
He had a cold.

00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:13,885
Patchouli-- they burn it
at music stores.

00:18:13,952 --> 00:18:15,620
Aluminum's the
odd man out.

00:18:15,687 --> 00:18:17,422
Warrick:
Yeah. I got Trace
putting together

00:18:17,489 --> 00:18:18,857
a list of products
made with the stuff.

00:18:18,924 --> 00:18:21,159
Something tells me
it's not lemonade.

00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:23,495
Jimson tea.

00:18:23,562 --> 00:18:25,697
I like to see what
I'm dealing with.

00:18:25,764 --> 00:18:27,299
Doesn't look
lethal, does it?

00:18:27,366 --> 00:18:28,767
Doesn't look like tea, either.

00:18:28,834 --> 00:18:31,103
You know what the
Japanese tea ceremony signifies?

00:18:31,169 --> 00:18:32,904
What's that?

00:18:32,971 --> 00:18:34,306
That every human encounter

00:18:34,373 --> 00:18:35,974
is a singular occasion

00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:38,777
which can never recur again
in exactly the same way.

00:18:38,844 --> 00:18:40,779
Does that apply to our case?

00:18:40,846 --> 00:18:43,148
Everything applies, Warrick.

00:18:43,215 --> 00:18:46,251
That's the beauty part.

00:18:46,318 --> 00:18:49,087
Cheers.

00:18:51,523 --> 00:18:53,392
All right,
it's true.

00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:54,526
Someone else
was there.

00:18:54,593 --> 00:18:56,061
A name would be nice.

00:18:56,128 --> 00:18:58,597
She's a friend on the faculty

00:18:58,664 --> 00:19:00,499
but she had nothing
to do with this.

00:19:00,565 --> 00:19:02,901
The blood evidence
is telling us otherwise.

00:19:02,968 --> 00:19:05,137
Look, homicide will give us
her name if you won't.

00:19:05,203 --> 00:19:07,439
There are detectives,
and your school's not that big.

00:19:07,506 --> 00:19:12,144
Julia Eastman, but she
was doing me a favor.

00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:15,180
She was just at
the wrong place
at the wrong time.

00:19:17,249 --> 00:19:18,817
We kind of made a plan

00:19:18,884 --> 00:19:21,553
so that the next time
Woods hit on her

00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,121
she'd have a witness.

00:19:23,188 --> 00:19:25,757
You know, because
of the harassment.

00:19:25,824 --> 00:19:27,993
When you were playing witness,
where were you standing?

00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:30,262
At the doorway.

00:19:30,329 --> 00:19:31,730
You're sure?

00:19:31,797 --> 00:19:33,966
Yeah.

00:19:34,032 --> 00:19:36,435
I know you want it.
Give us a little...

00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:40,739
( <i>woman sighing and crying</i> )

00:19:40,806 --> 00:19:42,207
Why you...

00:19:42,274 --> 00:19:43,875
( <i>grunt</i> )
Ah!

00:19:43,942 --> 00:19:47,112
( <i>grunts and sighs</i> )

00:19:47,179 --> 00:19:50,082
We're forensic scientists,
Julia.

00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:51,750
Blood talks to us.

00:19:51,817 --> 00:19:53,385
People exaggerate

00:19:53,452 --> 00:19:54,453
or forget.

00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:56,822
Blood's like my grandfather.
Never lies.

00:19:56,888 --> 00:20:00,492
Nick reenacted the crime
using blood spatter.

00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:03,829
No, I just strung it,
but thank you anyway.

00:20:03,895 --> 00:20:05,130
No, the computer
gizmo does

00:20:05,197 --> 00:20:06,365
all the geometry.

00:20:06,431 --> 00:20:07,933
Computer:
You factor in the location

00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,035
of the body in relation
to the blood on the wall

00:20:10,102 --> 00:20:11,069
in order to create

00:20:11,136 --> 00:20:13,605
an equation
that recreates the event.

00:20:13,672 --> 00:20:15,841
Each hit that drew blood


00:20:15,907 --> 00:20:18,010
gets its own unique color
as he fell.

00:20:18,076 --> 00:20:19,111
Nick:
See?

00:20:19,177 --> 00:20:20,812
Dean Woods was not
in a standing position.

00:20:20,879 --> 00:20:22,481
When he was killed,
he was on the floor.

00:20:22,547 --> 00:20:25,417
So how could
your friend Kate,
who's roughly half

00:20:25,484 --> 00:20:27,919
his size, wrestle him to the
ground and keep him there

00:20:27,986 --> 00:20:30,155
while she bludgeoned him
to death?

00:20:30,222 --> 00:20:31,189
Without help?

00:20:31,256 --> 00:20:34,126
I don't know.

00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:36,428
Hmm.

00:20:36,495 --> 00:20:38,764
Could we take a break?

00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,832
I need a break.

00:20:42,501 --> 00:20:43,502
Sure.

00:20:45,671 --> 00:20:50,876
( <i>rave music plays</i> )

00:21:08,293 --> 00:21:09,528
Three.

00:21:09,594 --> 00:21:12,664
It's gonna be 20 each.

00:21:33,418 --> 00:21:35,654
Teenage wasteland.

00:21:35,721 --> 00:21:36,922
Who?

00:21:36,989 --> 00:21:38,023
Yeah.

00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,830
Hi!

00:21:44,896 --> 00:21:45,931
Hi.

00:21:45,998 --> 00:21:48,533
I love you.

00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,768
( <i>nervous chuckle</i> )

00:21:49,835 --> 00:21:52,337
Uh, thank you.

00:21:52,404 --> 00:21:55,440
You're a total
stranger to me.

00:21:55,507 --> 00:21:56,441
It's Ecstasy.

00:21:56,508 --> 00:21:58,043
It makes everyone fall in love.

00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:00,812
Don't take it personally, miss.

00:22:00,879 --> 00:22:02,914
He's kind of married to his job.

00:22:05,917 --> 00:22:07,552
I love you.

00:22:11,256 --> 00:22:13,091
Come on. Let's go.

00:22:28,974 --> 00:22:31,176
That's him, there, there!

00:22:32,544 --> 00:22:33,712
Grissom:
Bobby, wait!

00:22:37,616 --> 00:22:39,084
You killed my friend!

00:22:39,151 --> 00:22:40,085
Break it up!

00:22:40,152 --> 00:22:41,386
Bobby, stop it!

00:22:41,453 --> 00:22:43,722
( <i>shouting</i> )

00:22:45,157 --> 00:22:46,725
Ow...!

00:22:49,995 --> 00:22:51,563
What do you guys think
you got on me?

00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:53,231
Selling jimsonweed to kids.

00:22:53,298 --> 00:22:55,467
Do you see any j-weed on me?

00:22:55,534 --> 00:22:56,802
You sent, uh, Bobby over here

00:22:56,868 --> 00:22:59,037
and his friend
on quite a trip the other night.

00:22:59,104 --> 00:23:00,072
Which trip was that?

00:23:00,138 --> 00:23:02,607
The one to San Diego
or the one to Mars?

00:23:02,674 --> 00:23:04,843
To the impound,
where your car is going.

00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:06,144
Probable cause.

00:23:06,211 --> 00:23:08,080
You don't have to take my car
to the impound.

00:23:08,146 --> 00:23:09,181
You can search it.

00:23:09,247 --> 00:23:10,615
But, I got news for you.

00:23:10,682 --> 00:23:12,951
Jimson's an unscheduled
controlled substance.

00:23:13,018 --> 00:23:14,419
Mandatory suspended sentence

00:23:14,486 --> 00:23:16,521
for the first go-round
for possession.

00:23:16,588 --> 00:23:18,423
And you can't even prove
that much.

00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:21,226
Guy knows a lot about
the Nevada state penal code.

00:23:21,293 --> 00:23:22,761
Well, if you're gonna break
the law

00:23:22,828 --> 00:23:23,929
you've gotta know the law.

00:23:23,996 --> 00:23:25,897
Exactly.

00:23:25,964 --> 00:23:28,600
Just don't scratch my puppy.

00:24:27,693 --> 00:24:30,062
What do you say, Ethan?

00:24:30,128 --> 00:24:31,463
These seeds look familiar?

00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:33,932
( <i>laughs</i> )

00:24:33,999 --> 00:24:35,667
You just fish those
out of your undies?

00:24:35,734 --> 00:24:37,569
Look, man, if you want
to take me in...

00:24:37,636 --> 00:24:38,904
take me in.

00:24:38,971 --> 00:24:40,505
I'll be back
before the party's over.

00:24:40,572 --> 00:24:41,974
'Cause you know the law,
don't you?

00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,209
Mandatory suspended sentence
for the first possession.

00:24:44,276 --> 00:24:45,744
Exactly.

00:24:45,811 --> 00:24:47,579
Let me tell you something.

00:24:47,646 --> 00:24:49,381
You're twice the age
of these kids

00:24:49,448 --> 00:24:51,917
and most of them couldn't find
their ass with a map.

00:24:51,984 --> 00:24:53,318
You prey on innocent children

00:24:53,385 --> 00:24:55,754
concocting God-knows-what
from God-knows-where

00:24:55,821 --> 00:24:57,356
selling Russian Roulette
in a bottle

00:24:57,422 --> 00:24:59,224
and you think we came
all the way out here

00:24:59,291 --> 00:25:01,393
to bust you for possession,
you dumb punk?

00:25:05,564 --> 00:25:07,299
I'm gonna get you for murder.

00:25:09,568 --> 00:25:11,970
Cool?

00:25:17,607 --> 00:25:20,243
This Ethan was
selling jimsonweed tea

00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,292
at the desert rave.

00:25:21,358 --> 00:25:23,294
I believe Eric drank
the most toxic part--

00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,162
the dregs,
the bottom
of the batch

00:25:25,229 --> 00:25:26,864
the part that's full of seeds.

00:25:26,931 --> 00:25:29,667
Williams:
If that's true,
then we might be able

00:25:29,733 --> 00:25:31,702
to catch up
with some of those seeds

00:25:31,769 --> 00:25:33,203
because they have a way

00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:35,706
of hanging around
the lower intestinal tract.

00:25:35,773 --> 00:25:39,109
The last ones to leave the party
would be right about here.

00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:44,815
Jimson reduced
his gastric motility

00:25:44,882 --> 00:25:47,651
which kept this in his system.

00:25:47,718 --> 00:25:50,387
Now we just tie that
to the dealer.

00:25:50,454 --> 00:25:52,022
Well, we see
if it ties to the dealer.

00:25:52,089 --> 00:25:54,358
That's not what you were saying
out at that rave

00:25:54,425 --> 00:25:55,960
all up in that guy's face.

00:25:56,026 --> 00:25:58,495
There's three things
I've got a real
problem with:

00:25:58,562 --> 00:26:02,967
Guys that hit their wives,
sexual assault on children

00:26:03,033 --> 00:26:06,136
and the scum
that deal death to kids.

00:26:08,372 --> 00:26:11,742
Warrick:
The chemical compositions
break down exactly the same.

00:26:11,809 --> 00:26:14,178
Yeah, but that doesn't
necessarily prove that the seeds

00:26:14,245 --> 00:26:16,213
from the dead kid's gut
came from the same place

00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,615
as the seeds
in the dealer's car.

00:26:17,681 --> 00:26:19,149
We'd need the pods
to do a DNA match

00:26:19,216 --> 00:26:20,517
and we don't have them.

00:26:20,584 --> 00:26:22,186
The truth is,
it wouldn't matter.

00:26:22,253 --> 00:26:23,754
I ran the seeds Eric ingested.

00:26:23,821 --> 00:26:25,022
The toxic levels are low

00:26:25,089 --> 00:26:26,490
too low to
have killed him.

00:26:26,557 --> 00:26:28,993
Square one.

00:26:30,394 --> 00:26:32,630
There is no way
I'm going to end up

00:26:32,696 --> 00:26:34,798
in a dumpster
wrapped in plastic.

00:26:34,865 --> 00:26:38,302
I'm going to be cremated--
dust in the wind, you know.

00:26:38,369 --> 00:26:40,838
I don't want any part
of these things.

00:26:40,905 --> 00:26:43,340
I've already got mine
paid off.

00:26:43,407 --> 00:26:45,009
Are you serious?

00:26:45,075 --> 00:26:47,511
Yeah. It looks
just like this one.

00:26:49,747 --> 00:26:51,181
How much did
it run you?

00:26:51,248 --> 00:26:52,950
Ten thou.

00:26:53,017 --> 00:26:54,285
$10,000...

00:26:54,351 --> 00:26:56,120
For a box buried in the ground

00:26:56,186 --> 00:26:58,622
that everyone's
only going to see you in once.

00:26:58,689 --> 00:26:59,957
I like it.

00:27:00,024 --> 00:27:02,259
It feels like a Caddie.

00:27:02,326 --> 00:27:08,632
So when you buy one of these
for $10,000, it's yours, right?

00:27:08,699 --> 00:27:10,167
Well, of course it is.

00:27:10,234 --> 00:27:12,970
No one else
gets to use it.

00:27:13,037 --> 00:27:15,205
It's built for one.

00:27:38,862 --> 00:27:41,432
Then how did
all these people get in here?

00:27:45,069 --> 00:27:48,672
Thought I'd
find you here.

00:27:48,739 --> 00:27:51,475
It's why I live.

00:27:51,542 --> 00:27:53,577
Evidence...

00:27:53,644 --> 00:27:57,181
the double-edged sword.

00:27:57,248 --> 00:28:00,651
Yeah, nobody wanted to put that
pusher in jail more than I did.

00:28:00,718 --> 00:28:02,453
The evidence sets him free.

00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:04,455
How do you feel about this?

00:28:04,521 --> 00:28:07,024
It doesn't matter how I feel.

00:28:07,091 --> 00:28:10,661
The evidence only knows
one thing: the truth.

00:28:10,728 --> 00:28:11,996
It is what it is.

00:28:12,062 --> 00:28:14,064
You don't really believe that,
do you?

00:28:15,699 --> 00:28:18,035
I was flying to a seminar
in New Hampshire

00:28:18,102 --> 00:28:19,536
a couple summers ago.

00:28:19,603 --> 00:28:20,838
I was sitting
on the plane

00:28:20,905 --> 00:28:22,539
next to this
philosophy professor

00:28:22,606 --> 00:28:23,874
from Harvard.

00:28:23,941 --> 00:28:25,910
He told me this story
about how every morning

00:28:25,976 --> 00:28:28,679
he takes a leak right after
his three-hour philosophy class.

00:28:28,746 --> 00:28:30,014
He'd flush the toilet

00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,682
there'd be
this tiny, brown spider

00:28:31,749 --> 00:28:32,883
fighting for its life

00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:35,719
against the
swirling water.

00:28:35,786 --> 00:28:37,821
Come back the next day, flush

00:28:37,888 --> 00:28:40,791
same spider clawing its way back
from oblivion.

00:28:40,858 --> 00:28:43,961
A week goes by, he decides
to liberate the spider.

00:28:44,028 --> 00:28:46,096
Grabs a paper towel,
scoops him up

00:28:46,163 --> 00:28:49,199
sets him on the floor
in the corner of the stall.

00:28:49,266 --> 00:28:50,935
Comes back the next day

00:28:51,001 --> 00:28:53,604
what do you think
happened to the spider?

00:28:53,671 --> 00:28:56,040
Dead.

00:28:56,106 --> 00:28:59,276
On his back,
eight legs in the air. Why?

00:29:00,945 --> 00:29:04,315
Because one life
imposed itself on another.

00:29:04,381 --> 00:29:07,284
Right then I realized
where we stand.

00:29:07,351 --> 00:29:09,954
I understood
our role.

00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,489
We don't impose our will
on a spider.

00:29:12,556 --> 00:29:15,426
We don't impose our hopes
on the evidence.

00:29:20,531 --> 00:29:23,133
Twenty, ten, five, boom!

00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,935
Touchdown, baby.

00:29:25,002 --> 00:29:27,304
What's my name?

00:29:27,371 --> 00:29:28,839
( <i>Ethan laughs</i> )

00:29:30,874 --> 00:29:32,309
You'll be back.

00:29:32,376 --> 00:29:33,644
Oh, really?
What, have you got

00:29:33,711 --> 00:29:35,646
a crystal ball
in your pocket or something?

00:29:35,713 --> 00:29:37,147
You're a creature of habit.

00:29:37,214 --> 00:29:39,917
I'll catch you later.

00:29:43,721 --> 00:29:47,524
Okay, this is what
we've got so far
on our dead dean.

00:29:47,591 --> 00:29:50,894
Blood spatter and
blood cast-off
on the walls.

00:29:50,961 --> 00:29:53,864
Kate Armstrong's
confession,
her clothes.

00:29:53,931 --> 00:29:57,167
Three void areas, and
that's pretty much it.

00:29:57,234 --> 00:29:58,669
Anything else?

00:29:58,736 --> 00:30:00,504
It's not enough,
it's not enough.

00:30:00,571 --> 00:30:02,506
What's the one thing
we're missing?

00:30:02,573 --> 00:30:04,508
That's it.

00:30:04,575 --> 00:30:05,843
What's it?

00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:07,511
The one thing
we're missing.

00:30:07,578 --> 00:30:08,979
The blood.

00:30:09,046 --> 00:30:10,447
On Julia's clothes.

00:30:10,514 --> 00:30:13,017
We need the clothes
that you were wearing

00:30:13,083 --> 00:30:15,419
the day that the dean
was killed.

00:30:15,486 --> 00:30:18,489
I burned them.

00:30:18,555 --> 00:30:20,024
Why?

00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:21,992
The blood wouldn't come out.

00:30:22,059 --> 00:30:23,494
They were ruined.

00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,663
Blood's funny that way.

00:30:25,729 --> 00:30:27,298
In fact, I bet

00:30:27,364 --> 00:30:31,135
there's plenty of blood
on Dean Woods' shirt.

00:30:35,272 --> 00:30:38,142
Look at that void.

00:30:38,208 --> 00:30:40,277
What a beaut.

00:30:40,344 --> 00:30:41,779
Oh, yeah.

00:30:41,845 --> 00:30:44,381
You don't even have
to know every star

00:30:44,448 --> 00:30:46,750
and you can draw
a constellation.

00:30:55,459 --> 00:30:59,863
And fill in the rest.

00:31:01,432 --> 00:31:05,669
Whoa, look at
that last finger there.

00:31:05,736 --> 00:31:08,706
Talk about
your unique attributes.

00:31:08,772 --> 00:31:10,741
What do you think,
a bandage?

00:31:10,808 --> 00:31:14,245
We'll have to ask our ladies,
but I can tell you this--

00:31:14,311 --> 00:31:16,647
somebody's playing
through the pain.

00:31:16,714 --> 00:31:19,083
Grissom:
I, uh...

00:31:19,149 --> 00:31:20,985
I just wanted you to know

00:31:21,051 --> 00:31:23,520
that Eric didn't die
from jimson tea.

00:31:23,587 --> 00:31:25,856
It didn't have
the chemical toxicity

00:31:25,923 --> 00:31:27,358
to kill him.

00:31:27,424 --> 00:31:29,627
The seeds weren't strong enough.

00:31:34,131 --> 00:31:35,266
Is your arm all right?

00:31:35,332 --> 00:31:37,868
Yeah, uh, spider bite.

00:31:37,935 --> 00:31:40,537
I think it's infected.

00:31:40,604 --> 00:31:42,039
May I take a look?

00:31:42,106 --> 00:31:43,841
Sure. You're a doctor.

00:31:43,908 --> 00:31:46,844
You might be able to give me
something for it.

00:31:46,911 --> 00:31:48,746
I'm a Ph.D.,
not an M.D.

00:31:48,812 --> 00:31:50,748
( <i>chuckling</i> )

00:31:57,554 --> 00:32:03,327
Bobby... this bite
is not from an insect.

00:32:25,421 --> 00:32:28,423
Hey.
Hi.

00:32:30,051 --> 00:32:33,455
I found a bite mark
on Bobby's arm

00:32:33,521 --> 00:32:36,524
and I think it might be human.

00:32:36,591 --> 00:32:38,629
Do you feel like sharing?

00:32:38,696 --> 00:32:39,731
Not really.

00:32:39,797 --> 00:32:41,132
Just a little?

00:32:41,199 --> 00:32:43,668
( <i>sighing</i> )

00:32:43,735 --> 00:32:45,670
I don't know, Jenna.

00:32:45,737 --> 00:32:49,407
This whole case is going
from bad to worse.

00:32:49,474 --> 00:32:53,244
I mean, usually it's a body,
it's a specimen

00:32:53,311 --> 00:32:55,280
but when it
involves kids,
I just can't...

00:32:55,346 --> 00:32:57,181
Gruesome Grissom...

00:32:57,248 --> 00:32:59,284
Tin man with a heart.

00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:01,619
Who knew?

00:33:01,686 --> 00:33:03,922
Hey, guys.

00:33:03,988 --> 00:33:05,823
This came back for the test

00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:09,561
on aluminum products
on our kid in the desert.

00:33:09,627 --> 00:33:12,330
Fireworks.

00:33:12,397 --> 00:33:14,465
That's where Bobby Taylor works.

00:33:17,202 --> 00:33:20,772
Jenna, I need a mold
of Eric's teeth

00:33:20,838 --> 00:33:24,042
<i>and an impression</i>
<i>of Bobby's arm.</i>

00:33:34,819 --> 00:33:38,323
Julia, make a fist for me
with your right hand.

00:33:38,389 --> 00:33:40,992
I mean, count it down like so,
starting with your thumb first.

00:33:41,059 --> 00:33:44,128
Five, four, three, two, one.

00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:01,446
Sprained it at tennis.

00:34:01,512 --> 00:34:04,015
It heals a lot faster
when you wear one of these.

00:34:11,356 --> 00:34:13,625
Dean Woods' shirt.

00:34:13,691 --> 00:34:16,394
Now, remember we said

00:34:16,461 --> 00:34:18,329
blood tells us
everything?

00:34:18,396 --> 00:34:22,433
Well... so does
the absence of blood.

00:34:29,207 --> 00:34:31,876
Oh, my God.

00:34:47,392 --> 00:34:48,893
You held him down...

00:34:50,662 --> 00:34:53,598
while she killed him.

00:34:53,665 --> 00:34:57,802
All because the guy was handsy?

00:35:00,505 --> 00:35:02,407
Seems a little severe.

00:35:06,511 --> 00:35:09,814
We're going to be placing you
under arrest for murder.

00:35:09,881 --> 00:35:12,283
Is there anything
you want to say?

00:35:31,636 --> 00:35:33,972
No, no, this isn't over.

00:35:34,038 --> 00:35:36,207
For all forensic purposes,
it is over.

00:35:36,274 --> 00:35:38,076
They're going to eat bread

00:35:38,142 --> 00:35:40,411
and bang a metal cup
against some bars.

00:35:40,478 --> 00:35:42,113
That's it.
It's over for us.

00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,915
We still don't know why.

00:35:43,982 --> 00:35:45,516
It's not our job to know why.

00:35:45,583 --> 00:35:46,885
It's our job to know how.

00:35:46,951 --> 00:35:48,052
You heard Grissom.

00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:49,721
The more the why,
the less the how

00:35:49,787 --> 00:35:51,489
the less the how,
the more the why.

00:35:51,556 --> 00:35:52,657
Hey, Nick.

00:35:52,724 --> 00:35:54,158
Yeah?

00:35:54,225 --> 00:35:56,427
Grissom's not
always right.

00:35:56,494 --> 00:35:57,795
Do yourself a favor.

00:35:57,862 --> 00:35:59,097
Think for yourself.

00:35:59,163 --> 00:36:02,433
I mean that as
a friend, okay?

00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:07,071
Okay, Detective, we've got
some more homework to do.

00:36:07,138 --> 00:36:09,007
What are you playing,
time-share coffins?

00:36:09,073 --> 00:36:11,409
Uh, there's no such thing
as a time-share coffin.

00:36:11,476 --> 00:36:12,744
Sure there is.

00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:14,879
Once the funeral is over,
you dump the body

00:36:14,946 --> 00:36:16,781
and use the same casket
over and over.

00:36:16,848 --> 00:36:18,650
You can't prove that.

00:36:18,716 --> 00:36:19,918
Yes, I can.

00:36:19,984 --> 00:36:22,487
This is a set of prints
on the inside

00:36:22,554 --> 00:36:25,924
of the plastic sheeting
we found in the dumpster.

00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:28,459
What are the odds
they belong to you?

00:36:30,595 --> 00:36:33,531
All you had to do
was put the bodies

00:36:33,598 --> 00:36:34,699
back in the grave

00:36:34,766 --> 00:36:36,868
and no one would have been
the wiser.

00:36:36,935 --> 00:36:39,671
You have no idea what
a cutthroat business this is.

00:36:39,737 --> 00:36:41,105
The chains are moving in.

00:36:41,172 --> 00:36:42,473
I have payments to make.

00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:44,309
I see the world
from a completely

00:36:44,375 --> 00:36:46,544
different perspective
than most people.

00:36:46,611 --> 00:36:47,545
Yeah, I know.

00:36:47,612 --> 00:36:48,846
You see dead people.
So do I.

00:36:48,913 --> 00:36:50,848
And when they turn up
in dumpsters

00:36:50,915 --> 00:36:53,017
I like to see they get back
to where they belong.

00:36:53,084 --> 00:36:54,118
I'll repay the money.

00:36:54,185 --> 00:36:55,386
Minimum.

00:36:55,453 --> 00:36:57,789
Then you're going to pay
for Stephanie Reyes' family

00:36:57,855 --> 00:36:59,057
to have
a real burial.
Okay.

00:36:59,123 --> 00:37:00,358
At a respectable mortuary.

00:37:00,425 --> 00:37:01,960
Okay.

00:37:02,026 --> 00:37:04,195
Then we're going to let the DA
run a table.

00:37:06,898 --> 00:37:08,099
Did some homework
on Kate.

00:37:08,166 --> 00:37:09,434
Mm-hmm.

00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,102
Financial records
for the last year.

00:37:11,169 --> 00:37:12,937
Great.

00:37:13,004 --> 00:37:15,907
Personal checks
from Kate Armstrong

00:37:15,974 --> 00:37:18,610
to Vernon Woods
over the last year.

00:37:18,676 --> 00:37:22,947
$5,000.
Another for $5,000.

00:37:23,014 --> 00:37:27,785
$3,000.
"Memo: loans."

00:37:27,852 --> 00:37:30,288
I don't think so.

00:37:30,355 --> 00:37:34,225
I think she was paying him off
for something.

00:37:34,292 --> 00:37:35,627
Did Julia say anything?

00:37:35,693 --> 00:37:37,962
Like what?

00:37:38,029 --> 00:37:41,032
The real reason
you killed Woods?

00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:45,270
This is where
Grissom and I differ.

00:37:45,336 --> 00:37:48,273
Forensics is about
more than science.

00:37:48,339 --> 00:37:49,674
Human behavior.

00:37:49,741 --> 00:37:53,144
The inconsistencies
of human behavior.

00:37:53,211 --> 00:37:59,651
Yes, "how" is crucially
important, but so is "why."

00:38:04,489 --> 00:38:07,125
Okay.

00:38:07,191 --> 00:38:08,960
I'm finished paying you.

00:38:09,027 --> 00:38:11,696
We're going to live openly,
honestly.

00:38:11,763 --> 00:38:13,164
It's a new century.

00:38:13,231 --> 00:38:14,699
Parents are evolved.

00:38:14,766 --> 00:38:16,634
Not where their children
are concerned.

00:38:16,701 --> 00:38:17,936
I'll tell everybody

00:38:18,002 --> 00:38:20,071
that I caught you two
having sex on school grounds.

00:38:20,138 --> 00:38:21,773
That's a lie!
What?!

00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:23,074
Of course it's a lie.

00:38:23,141 --> 00:38:25,310
That didn't stop
the McMartin School

00:38:25,376 --> 00:38:26,744
from closing down.

00:38:28,546 --> 00:38:31,249
Yeah, I think
I'll make a call.

00:38:35,653 --> 00:38:41,459
Julia and I would never
have survived a rumor like that.

00:38:41,526 --> 00:38:43,127
We panicked.

00:38:43,194 --> 00:38:45,697
The school is our whole life.

00:38:49,634 --> 00:38:51,903
Mm, you got your "why."

00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:53,771
Crime of passion.

00:38:53,838 --> 00:38:56,908
Bigger "why":

00:38:56,975 --> 00:38:59,978
why did it have
to come down to this?

00:39:00,044 --> 00:39:03,281
I guess they didn't feel like
they had a choice.

00:39:03,348 --> 00:39:06,584
Maybe they didn't.

00:39:06,651 --> 00:39:11,289
A lose-lose situation.

00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:18,496
I'm telling you,
I didn't kill Eric.

00:39:18,563 --> 00:39:20,698
Can you remember
your last hours
with him Saturday?

00:39:20,765 --> 00:39:21,699
Don't answer that.

00:39:21,766 --> 00:39:22,767
I want to answer it.

00:39:22,834 --> 00:39:24,636
I just... I can't
remember anything

00:39:24,702 --> 00:39:26,037
after we took that stuff.

00:39:26,104 --> 00:39:28,373
It's not about
memory now, Bobby.

00:39:28,439 --> 00:39:30,041
It's about the evidence

00:39:30,108 --> 00:39:35,013
and the evidence...
sucks.

00:39:35,079 --> 00:39:38,616
Grissom:
<i>You and Eric bought jimson tea</i>
<i>from Ethan that night.</i>

00:39:38,683 --> 00:39:40,451
Enjoy, fellas!

00:39:40,518 --> 00:39:41,686
( <i>laughing</i> )

00:39:43,354 --> 00:39:46,691
Cheers, man.

00:39:46,758 --> 00:39:48,960
But you guys have never taken
j-weed before

00:39:49,027 --> 00:39:50,895
so you weren't aware
of the side effects

00:39:50,962 --> 00:39:52,230
of photophobia.

00:39:52,297 --> 00:39:53,231
Ph-photo what?

00:39:53,298 --> 00:39:54,766
Photophobia.

00:39:54,832 --> 00:39:57,202
It's just a big word
for lights freaking you out.

00:39:57,268 --> 00:39:58,970
You guys were
hallucinating

00:39:59,037 --> 00:40:00,805
and whatever
Eric was seeing

00:40:00,872 --> 00:40:02,607
was scaring him,
big-time.

00:40:14,652 --> 00:40:16,721
The coroner states
that Eric's dose

00:40:16,788 --> 00:40:19,057
shot his temperature
through the roof.

00:40:19,123 --> 00:40:21,059
He was boiling
in his own skin.

00:40:21,125 --> 00:40:22,560
So he stripped

00:40:22,627 --> 00:40:24,862
which is why we
found him naked.

00:40:32,003 --> 00:40:33,204
We just don't know

00:40:33,271 --> 00:40:35,206
if it was an act of aggression
or self-defense.

00:40:35,273 --> 00:40:36,374
I loved that guy.

00:40:36,441 --> 00:40:38,977
Grissom:
That's why I
tend to believe

00:40:39,043 --> 00:40:40,879
it was an act
of self-protection.

00:40:40,945 --> 00:40:42,580
The lights were scaring him.

00:40:42,647 --> 00:40:44,449
At the same time, we conjecture

00:40:44,515 --> 00:40:47,318
that you were suffering
auditory hallucinations.

00:40:47,385 --> 00:40:49,387
Both of these
symptoms are routine

00:40:49,454 --> 00:40:50,622
with this drug.

00:40:54,158 --> 00:40:55,226
( <i>groaning</i> )

00:40:55,293 --> 00:40:57,629
Shut up! Shut <i>up!</i>

00:40:57,695 --> 00:40:59,797
Shut up! Shut up!

00:40:59,864 --> 00:41:02,166
Shut up! Shut... shut up!

00:41:02,233 --> 00:41:04,235
( <i>both grunting</i> )

00:41:04,302 --> 00:41:06,538
Shut up...

00:41:06,604 --> 00:41:11,109
I just...
I-I can't remember, honest.

00:41:11,175 --> 00:41:14,012
You can "believe"
and "conjecture" all you want.

00:41:14,078 --> 00:41:16,347
None of this
is based on fact.

00:41:16,414 --> 00:41:18,516
I'm afraid that it is.

00:41:18,583 --> 00:41:23,288
The evidence tells us
that Bobby suffocated Eric.

00:41:25,189 --> 00:41:27,158
We found traces
of aluminum

00:41:27,225 --> 00:41:29,761
trapped in Eric's
nostrils that are
consistent

00:41:29,827 --> 00:41:32,096
with what we found
in your client's
hands and arms

00:41:32,163 --> 00:41:35,700
earlier today from his job
at the fireworks plant.

00:41:37,235 --> 00:41:40,738
I don't think I would do that.

00:41:40,805 --> 00:41:45,810
I know, Bobby, but you did.

00:41:51,049 --> 00:41:52,550
This is a mold of the bite mark

00:41:52,617 --> 00:41:54,252
that we took
from your arm today.

00:41:58,456 --> 00:42:02,026
This is a mold of Eric's mouth,
postmortem.

00:42:10,668 --> 00:42:15,273
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:18,276
Come on, you shut up!
Shut up! Shut up!

00:42:18,343 --> 00:42:20,478
You shut up!

00:42:20,545 --> 00:42:22,513
( <i>Eric yells</i> )

00:42:25,717 --> 00:42:29,187
You overpowered him.
He suffocated...

00:42:29,254 --> 00:42:33,558
and then finally
the noise stopped.

00:42:40,198 --> 00:42:41,599
I can tell you right now

00:42:41,666 --> 00:42:44,135
we're going to plead
diminished capacity.

00:42:44,202 --> 00:42:45,470
Good.

00:42:45,537 --> 00:42:48,072
I hope you win.

00:42:48,139 --> 00:42:49,407
It doesn't matter.

00:42:49,474 --> 00:42:51,376
It's the difference
between

00:42:51,442 --> 00:42:52,810
prison and a hospital, Bobby.

00:42:52,877 --> 00:42:53,978
It matters.

00:42:54,045 --> 00:42:56,614
You don't understand.

00:42:56,681 --> 00:42:58,616
I don't care what happens to me.

00:42:58,683 --> 00:43:01,686
I killed my best friend.

00:43:36,854 --> 00:43:38,957
( <i>vehicle engine starts</i> )

00:43:39,023 --> 00:43:40,225
Where you going?

00:43:40,291 --> 00:43:42,126
Away.
