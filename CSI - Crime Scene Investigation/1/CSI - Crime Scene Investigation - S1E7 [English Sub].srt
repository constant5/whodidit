00:00:24,792 --> 00:00:28,792
Woman ( <i>screaming</i> ):
Help me!

00:00:28,792 --> 00:00:31,462
Help me! Somebody, please!

00:00:31,528 --> 00:00:33,664
Please...

00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:35,632
Oh, God! Somebody help me!

00:00:35,699 --> 00:00:37,468
( <i>sobbing</i> )

00:00:37,534 --> 00:00:38,702
Please!

00:00:38,769 --> 00:00:40,404
Help me!

00:00:40,471 --> 00:00:42,539
Help me!

00:00:44,675 --> 00:00:46,276
Help me!

00:00:46,343 --> 00:00:47,678
Help me!

00:00:47,744 --> 00:00:48,979
Please!

00:00:49,046 --> 00:00:52,983
( <i>indistinct radio</i>
<i>transmissions</i> )

00:01:13,303 --> 00:01:14,571
Hey.

00:01:14,638 --> 00:01:16,173
Heads up. The press
is gonna be

00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,708
all over this one.

00:01:17,775 --> 00:01:20,110
Did the count change
since you called me?

00:01:20,177 --> 00:01:23,147
Four dead: mother, father,
two teenage boys.

00:01:23,213 --> 00:01:25,115
The sisters were luckier.

00:01:25,182 --> 00:01:27,351
Teen girl heard a noise,
hid in the closet.

00:01:27,417 --> 00:01:30,454
Alerted the neighbors
after all the shouting
was done.

00:01:30,521 --> 00:01:33,423
Younger sister's
over there.

00:01:34,758 --> 00:01:37,494
They couldn't have killed
their father tag team--

00:01:37,561 --> 00:01:38,495
soaking wet.

00:01:38,562 --> 00:01:40,764
What's the matter

00:01:40,831 --> 00:01:41,799
with your guys?

00:01:41,865 --> 00:01:43,534
They've been inside.

00:01:51,074 --> 00:01:52,843

Put these on.

00:02:41,577 --> 00:02:45,547
I'm going to do
a preliminary
walk-through.

00:02:45,614 --> 00:02:48,250
You're going
to take my notes.

00:03:03,499 --> 00:03:04,800
Don't touch that!

00:03:04,867 --> 00:03:06,802
I want everything exactly
the way it was.

00:03:19,214 --> 00:03:22,317
The air smells like copper.

00:03:22,384 --> 00:03:24,019
Lots of blood.

00:03:24,086 --> 00:03:26,788
Breathe through your mouth.

00:03:26,855 --> 00:03:29,191
Yes, sir.

00:03:52,281 --> 00:03:54,049
Male Caucasian

00:03:54,116 --> 00:03:56,151
approximately 40 years old

00:03:56,218 --> 00:03:58,487
lying in a pool of blood.

00:04:02,491 --> 00:04:04,092
No drag marks.

00:04:05,694 --> 00:04:07,863
Body does not appear
to have been moved.

00:04:10,232 --> 00:04:11,633
Multiple stab wounds

00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,770
to the back and neck.

00:04:15,637 --> 00:04:17,873
Looks like a single-edged blade.

00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,809
Force to such a degree
that the left and right

00:04:20,876 --> 00:04:22,544
internal jugular veins

00:04:22,611 --> 00:04:25,547
have been transected.

00:04:25,614 --> 00:04:26,682
Head faces west.

00:04:26,748 --> 00:04:29,218
Feet pointing east

00:04:29,284 --> 00:04:31,587
Approximately two feet
from the north wall

00:04:31,653 --> 00:04:32,588
one foot from the south.

00:04:32,654 --> 00:04:36,058
C-Could you take your own notes?

00:04:36,124 --> 00:04:38,093
I think that I'm
going to be sick.

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,528
I've got it.

00:04:39,595 --> 00:04:41,363
Go get some fresh air.

00:04:43,599 --> 00:04:45,467
I heard on the scanner.
Quadruple.

00:04:45,534 --> 00:04:47,236
Figured you might need a hand.

00:04:47,302 --> 00:04:49,438
You don't sleep, do you?

00:04:49,505 --> 00:04:50,706
Mm.

00:04:50,772 --> 00:04:53,108
Blood swirl
on the wall.

00:04:53,175 --> 00:04:55,544
Are you thinking cult?

00:04:55,611 --> 00:04:57,079
Manson?

00:04:57,145 --> 00:04:59,882
Somebody left a message.

00:05:02,084 --> 00:05:04,319
I need to see the rest of it.

00:05:12,828 --> 00:05:15,931
Female Caucasian.

00:05:15,998 --> 00:05:17,199
Appears to be

00:05:17,266 --> 00:05:18,767
one stab wound to the throat.

00:05:18,834 --> 00:05:22,337
Transection of left and right
carotid arteries

00:05:22,404 --> 00:05:26,608
with exsanguinating hemorrhage.

00:05:26,675 --> 00:05:28,510
No defense marks.

00:05:28,577 --> 00:05:31,613
Cursory opinion:
She was killed in her sleep.

00:05:34,483 --> 00:05:38,654
( <i>dripping</i> )

00:05:58,974 --> 00:06:01,009
Do you feel this?

00:06:02,311 --> 00:06:05,013
Her soul's still in the room.

00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,516
There's something else.

00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:03,165
You want a barf bag?

00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:05,601
I want the paramedics
that were in this house

00:08:05,667 --> 00:08:06,869
back here immediately.

00:08:06,935 --> 00:08:09,638
Police escort.
Get them on this
front lawn now.

00:08:09,705 --> 00:08:10,806
You'd think I work for you

00:08:10,873 --> 00:08:12,174
instead the other
way around.

00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,175
Call dispatch.

00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:15,410
You tell my entire
graveyard shift

00:08:15,477 --> 00:08:17,379
that I want them
here A.S.A.P.

00:08:17,446 --> 00:08:19,214
All of them,
no exceptions.

00:08:19,281 --> 00:08:21,650
Sara, those photos--
blown up times ten.

00:08:21,717 --> 00:08:24,253
Tell the lab that we need
every forensics tool

00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,054
available to us here
right away.

00:08:26,121 --> 00:08:28,790
This is the only crime scene
in Las Vegas tonight.

00:08:28,857 --> 00:08:29,858
Yes, sir.

00:08:31,193 --> 00:08:32,661
The fear in this neighborhood

00:08:32,728 --> 00:08:34,396
just south
of Las Vegas Boulevard

00:08:34,463 --> 00:08:35,764
is almost palpable.

00:08:35,831 --> 00:08:38,901
Scott Collins, his wife and
two sons were brutally murdered

00:08:38,967 --> 00:08:40,235
in their beds.

00:08:40,302 --> 00:08:42,271
Authorities thus far have
offered no comment

00:08:42,337 --> 00:08:44,473
fueling the fears
of the neighbors

00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:47,743
that a killer is on the lose.

00:08:47,809 --> 00:08:50,145
It's okay.

00:08:50,212 --> 00:08:51,446
We'll give you clothes.

00:08:51,513 --> 00:08:53,482
The lab guys just want
to see yours.

00:08:53,549 --> 00:08:55,083
Sergeant, may I?

00:08:56,585 --> 00:08:58,587
( <i>sobbing</i> )
Tina...

00:08:58,654 --> 00:09:01,390
I'm very sorry about
what happened to you tonight.

00:09:01,456 --> 00:09:03,058
But everything we take
from your house

00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,160
can help us find out
what happened to your family.

00:09:05,227 --> 00:09:08,964
When can I be
with my sister?

00:09:09,031 --> 00:09:12,134
She's so scared.

00:09:16,505 --> 00:09:17,773
Soon.

00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,508
Detective.

00:09:33,021 --> 00:09:34,356
Hi.

00:09:36,525 --> 00:09:37,960
Is your name Brenda?

00:09:40,429 --> 00:09:43,398
I'm trying to find out
who hurt your family.

00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,902
Do you think you could help me?

00:09:49,705 --> 00:09:52,074
Did anyone come into your room
tonight?

00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,643
Through the door?

00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:57,346
Through the window maybe?

00:10:04,653 --> 00:10:06,722
Okay.

00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,194
( <i>softly</i> ):
The buffalo.

00:10:23,105 --> 00:10:24,907
The buffalo?

00:10:26,975 --> 00:10:29,111
Who's the buffalo?

00:10:33,282 --> 00:10:34,716
Brenda?

00:10:58,173 --> 00:11:00,375
First rule for
this crime scene:

00:11:00,442 --> 00:11:02,211
do not do
any interviews.

00:11:02,277 --> 00:11:05,881
Second rule: don't talk
to the sheriff either.

00:11:05,948 --> 00:11:07,282
Media have it right?
Four dead?

00:11:07,349 --> 00:11:09,017
The killer was here
not two hours ago.

00:11:09,084 --> 00:11:11,253
He left part
of himself behind.

00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,822
Catherine, I need
you inside, mapping
and blood samples.

00:11:13,889 --> 00:11:14,823
You got it.

00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:16,124
Nick, Warrick-- the perimeter.

00:11:16,191 --> 00:11:17,426
I want to know how he got here

00:11:17,493 --> 00:11:19,428
how he got in, how he got out,
and how he left.

00:11:19,495 --> 00:11:20,796
I'll take the back.
You got the front?

00:11:20,863 --> 00:11:22,297
You got it.

00:11:33,976 --> 00:11:35,978
Hey, O'Riley,
Grissom wants
to see you.

00:11:41,116 --> 00:11:43,051
They said you were
looking for me.

00:11:43,118 --> 00:11:45,154
Hey, stop! Evidence!

00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,956
We're going to
hug the wall?

00:11:48,023 --> 00:11:49,925
This is the only room
with no blood in it.

00:11:49,992 --> 00:11:51,560
There's nothing
to disturb.

00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:53,962
You guys will never get it,
will you?

00:12:10,579 --> 00:12:12,447
Grissom:
Knife drawer.

00:12:16,051 --> 00:12:17,820
One missing.

00:12:17,886 --> 00:12:20,656
It's the only drawer open.

00:12:20,722 --> 00:12:22,357
The killer knew
where they were going.

00:12:22,424 --> 00:12:26,562
I think the suspect's
been in this house before.

00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:30,866
And this is the first place
they stopped tonight.

00:12:32,367 --> 00:12:35,337
Good. Linoleum.

00:12:36,738 --> 00:12:37,773
The best surface.

00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,542
Best surface for what?

00:12:53,422 --> 00:12:56,892
O'Riley:
You guys got some toys...

00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,328
It's not a toy, O'Riley.

00:12:59,394 --> 00:13:01,463
It's an Electrostatic
Dust Print Lifter.

00:13:02,798 --> 00:13:06,201
Okay...

00:13:06,268 --> 00:13:08,770
Like a supercharged
lint remover.

00:13:08,837 --> 00:13:12,207
Only it lifts footprints.

00:13:12,274 --> 00:13:14,276
Possibly our killer's.

00:13:25,654 --> 00:13:27,923
We did everything
by the book, sir.

00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:30,659
Relax. I just want
to know where you
walked in the house

00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:32,728
and who you
touched in there.

00:13:32,794 --> 00:13:35,664
Well, we did use the main entry,
and up the stairs.

00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:39,368
But once we saw the husband,
we grabbed the walls.

00:13:39,434 --> 00:13:41,370
I felt the pulses in each room.

00:13:41,436 --> 00:13:42,704
Once I found they were dead,
we booked.

00:13:42,771 --> 00:13:44,273
Show me the bottom
of your shoe.

00:13:55,684 --> 00:13:57,186
Now yours.

00:14:03,091 --> 00:14:05,427
You fellows were both
in the kitchen.

00:14:05,494 --> 00:14:06,595
We didn't see bodies
in there

00:14:06,662 --> 00:14:08,730
so I didn't think twice
about walking on the surface.

00:14:08,797 --> 00:14:11,600
All right. Yours
are the only clean
prints I found.

00:14:11,667 --> 00:14:12,968
Thanks.

00:14:13,035 --> 00:14:14,636
You can go back to work.

00:14:17,105 --> 00:14:18,707
News bim's waiting for you.

00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:20,442
Thinks you have

00:14:20,509 --> 00:14:21,376
an "interesting look."

00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:22,744
Newswoman:
Any truth to the rumor

00:14:22,811 --> 00:14:23,745
that a cult may have

00:14:23,812 --> 00:14:24,613
committed these crimes?

00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,714
I don't know that.

00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,249
But you wouldn't rule it out?

00:14:27,316 --> 00:14:28,784
I don't rule anything out.

00:14:28,851 --> 00:14:31,253
Sheriff:
Grissom.

00:14:32,921 --> 00:14:34,590
Sheriff?

00:14:34,656 --> 00:14:36,458
The Mayor has
already called.

00:14:36,525 --> 00:14:37,893
So what have you got?

00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,795
Nothing.

00:14:39,862 --> 00:14:43,298
I'm not asking you
to lay out your whole case.

00:14:43,365 --> 00:14:44,967
Just give me something
I can run with.

00:14:45,033 --> 00:14:48,203
I have got to feed the press
and defuse the panic.

00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:51,507
As soon as I have something,
you'll have something.

00:14:51,573 --> 00:14:53,008
Here's a thought.

00:14:53,075 --> 00:14:56,612
Why don't you try
being more like Ecklie?

00:14:56,678 --> 00:14:58,914
Maybe we need him
and his day shift crew

00:14:58,981 --> 00:14:59,982
on this case with you.

00:15:00,048 --> 00:15:01,984
I could speak volumes
about Conrad Ecklie

00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:03,519
but I have a crime scene
to process

00:15:03,585 --> 00:15:05,954
so... you'll have to excuse me.

00:15:08,423 --> 00:15:10,325
Sheriff, can you tell me
what went on inside?

00:15:10,392 --> 00:15:11,927
Let me assure everyone

00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,196
that the situation
is well under control.

00:15:17,065 --> 00:15:18,667
You want me inside?

00:15:18,734 --> 00:15:20,402
I need you
to transport
the little girl

00:15:20,469 --> 00:15:21,570
to the police department.

00:15:21,637 --> 00:15:22,671
Brass is waiting for you.

00:15:22,738 --> 00:15:23,672
You're kidding me?

00:15:23,739 --> 00:15:24,773
Right?

00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,109
I'm a taxi service
on the biggest case of the year?

00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,143
Sara...

00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:32,252
I need one of us
with that little girl.

00:17:05,288 --> 00:17:07,457
I want to see all of
their personal property.

00:17:07,523 --> 00:17:09,225
Clothes, jewelry,
whatever they have on.

00:17:09,292 --> 00:17:10,994
If there's something
under all this blood

00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,762
you'll be the first to know.

00:17:20,103 --> 00:17:22,105
This kid should be out
playing Pop Warner.

00:17:31,948 --> 00:17:34,584
Catherine:
I got the blood samples

00:17:34,651 --> 00:17:35,618
on the way to the lab.

00:17:35,685 --> 00:17:36,653
Good.

00:17:36,719 --> 00:17:38,254
You buy this cult thing?

00:17:38,321 --> 00:17:39,756
You mean the blood swirls

00:17:39,822 --> 00:17:42,392
next to the father's body
in the boys' room?

00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:45,962
I studied pictures
of the Manson murders.

00:17:46,029 --> 00:17:49,098
This isn't butter.
It's imitation.

00:17:49,165 --> 00:17:51,601
What's your take?

00:17:51,668 --> 00:17:55,204
Whoever did it
killed the mother first.

00:17:55,271 --> 00:17:57,106
In her sleep, quick.

00:17:57,173 --> 00:17:59,342
Explains why the
blood is confined

00:17:59,409 --> 00:18:01,945
to the bed and
the floor under it.

00:18:02,011 --> 00:18:04,180
Husband woke up.

00:18:04,247 --> 00:18:06,149
Ran to protect his kids.

00:18:06,215 --> 00:18:09,953
The killer nicked him here.

00:18:10,019 --> 00:18:13,890
and then finished him off
down the hall.

00:18:13,957 --> 00:18:17,527
Gave his life for
the little girl.

00:18:17,594 --> 00:18:18,895
There should be
more blood.

00:18:18,962 --> 00:18:20,363
Yeah.

00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:23,600
It's a hole.
We need to fill it.

00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:25,868
If we start from the inside
and fan out

00:18:25,935 --> 00:18:28,871
whoever's left at the scene...

00:18:28,938 --> 00:18:31,107
The first suspect.

00:18:34,477 --> 00:18:35,812
The teen daughter?

00:18:35,878 --> 00:18:37,780
She'd need help.

00:18:37,847 --> 00:18:41,150
Maybe a boyfriend?

00:18:41,217 --> 00:18:43,019
I wonder if they
call him Buffalo.

00:18:46,289 --> 00:18:48,891
Sara:
Catherine's the one
with the kid, not me.

00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:50,293
And O'Riley was
primary on this

00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,828
till it passed over
to me, big deal.

00:18:51,894 --> 00:18:53,329
What about Family Services?

00:18:53,396 --> 00:18:54,397
Can't they take her?

00:18:54,464 --> 00:18:55,565
They sent their
case worker

00:18:55,632 --> 00:18:56,499
over to the hospital

00:18:56,566 --> 00:18:57,867
so meet her there
with the kid.

00:18:57,934 --> 00:18:59,202
I am not good with kids.

00:18:59,269 --> 00:19:01,971
Look, I'm not asking
you to adopt her

00:19:02,038 --> 00:19:05,441
just take her over
to Sunrise for a
psych eval, will you?

00:19:14,917 --> 00:19:16,953
That's very pretty.

00:19:19,422 --> 00:19:22,292
Or not.

00:19:22,358 --> 00:19:24,694
Want to go for another ride?

00:19:27,463 --> 00:19:29,732
I'll take that as a "yes."

00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:33,903
Tina, do you know what time
you heard those noises?

00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:38,308
No, but they sounded
like footsteps

00:19:38,374 --> 00:19:39,876
coming from the kitchen.

00:19:39,943 --> 00:19:41,778
And that's when you
hid in the closet?

00:19:41,844 --> 00:19:43,279
Yes.

00:19:43,346 --> 00:19:44,414
Does your family normally

00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,015
keep the doors locked at night?

00:19:46,082 --> 00:19:47,717
I don't know.

00:19:47,784 --> 00:19:50,687
My dad checks the house
at night.

00:19:50,753 --> 00:19:52,655
It's always been

00:19:52,722 --> 00:19:54,057
a safe neighborhood.

00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:57,894
Tina...

00:19:57,961 --> 00:19:59,162
Do you...

00:19:59,228 --> 00:20:02,365
go out with anyone special?

00:20:02,432 --> 00:20:05,635
I hook up with different guys.

00:20:05,702 --> 00:20:07,537
No one special.

00:20:07,604 --> 00:20:12,976
Are any of them...
called Buffalo?

00:20:13,042 --> 00:20:16,079
Buffalo?

00:20:17,847 --> 00:20:20,149
No.

00:20:20,216 --> 00:20:23,586
How about this, Tina?

00:20:23,653 --> 00:20:25,888
You live in a house
with six people, right?

00:20:25,955 --> 00:20:30,260
You must be used to hearing
footsteps in the kitchen
late at night.

00:20:30,326 --> 00:20:32,295
Why so scared last night?

00:20:32,362 --> 00:20:35,632
I know my brothers' footsteps.

00:20:35,698 --> 00:20:37,200
And my dad's.

00:20:38,801 --> 00:20:41,437
These were different.

00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:49,846
Nick:
How do you know it's fresh?

00:20:49,912 --> 00:20:51,514
I checked the
sprinkler system.

00:20:51,581 --> 00:20:53,916
It goes off every night
at 0200.

00:20:53,983 --> 00:20:55,818
And paramedics
pronounced at 0240.

00:20:55,885 --> 00:20:58,288
So somebody came
out of the house

00:20:58,354 --> 00:21:02,292
and got on what looks
to be a step down
from a motorcycle

00:21:02,358 --> 00:21:04,127
and drove it
across the lawn.

00:21:04,193 --> 00:21:05,728
And I bet he dropped
the bidi I found

00:21:05,795 --> 00:21:06,963
in the back on the way out.

00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:07,931
Bidi?

00:21:07,997 --> 00:21:09,032
Hand-rolled cigarettes?

00:21:10,466 --> 00:21:12,435
Probably a teenager.
They're always taking shortcuts.

00:21:12,502 --> 00:21:14,570
How's that hand?

00:21:14,637 --> 00:21:15,571
Hmm?

00:21:15,638 --> 00:21:16,906
I saw you beating
up the door

00:21:16,973 --> 00:21:17,907
a little while ago.

00:21:17,974 --> 00:21:19,175
You all right?

00:21:19,242 --> 00:21:21,044
Yeah. It's cool.

00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:23,146
I'll see you back at the lab.

00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,788
Sara:
Hey, Brenda.

00:21:31,854 --> 00:21:33,990
One of you
with Family Services?

00:21:34,057 --> 00:21:35,058
I am. Connie Bellvue.

00:21:35,124 --> 00:21:36,893
Doctor:
Brenda's fine

00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,494
but I'd like her
to have a consult.

00:21:38,561 --> 00:21:39,862
I've paged
the psychiatric resident.

00:21:39,929 --> 00:21:41,230
He should be here
within the hour.

00:21:43,199 --> 00:21:44,901
Thanks. I'll take
it from here.

00:21:46,235 --> 00:21:47,503
What's the head exam for?

00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:49,172
I <i>said...</i>

00:21:49,238 --> 00:21:50,173
we'll take it
from here.

00:21:50,239 --> 00:21:52,976
Look, if there's
any forensic evidence

00:21:53,042 --> 00:21:55,211
found during this exam,
I need to be there.

00:21:55,278 --> 00:21:56,746
It's already going
to be tense.

00:21:56,813 --> 00:22:00,483
Go back to
your crime lab.

00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:01,751
I'll keep you posted.

00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:04,687
It's okay, Brenda.

00:22:04,754 --> 00:22:07,357
I'm not leaving you.

00:23:24,567 --> 00:23:26,636
( <i>thud</i> )

00:23:26,703 --> 00:23:28,938
Damn. That you, Warrick?

00:23:29,005 --> 00:23:31,307
You need to tell somebody
when you're cutting the lights.

00:23:31,374 --> 00:23:32,275
What, are you working

00:23:32,342 --> 00:23:33,943
for OSHA now?

00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:36,179
Grissom, you remember
those tire treads

00:23:36,245 --> 00:23:38,114
I found on the
front lawn?

00:23:38,181 --> 00:23:40,116
Well, I ran them
through the FBI register

00:23:40,183 --> 00:23:41,017
and they belong to

00:23:41,084 --> 00:23:42,552
a '93 Honda scooter.

00:23:42,619 --> 00:23:43,620
That's good.

00:23:43,686 --> 00:23:44,654
I DMV'd it.

00:23:44,721 --> 00:23:47,824
A kid four blocks
away from the scene

00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:49,459
owns the same make.

00:23:49,525 --> 00:23:50,393
That's very good.

00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,894
I might've
just blown open the case

00:23:51,961 --> 00:23:53,830
and all you give me
is a "that's very good"?

00:23:53,896 --> 00:23:55,198
If your whole family
was murdered

00:23:55,265 --> 00:23:57,634
wouldn't you run to them
to see if they were still alive?

00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,002
Yeah.

00:24:02,372 --> 00:24:05,041
This is a Lady Macbeth.

00:24:05,108 --> 00:24:06,876
Lady Macbeth?

00:24:06,943 --> 00:24:08,745
"Out, out, damn spot."

00:24:08,811 --> 00:24:10,880
There's not a trace
of blood

00:24:10,947 --> 00:24:12,882
on the teen daughter's clothing.

00:24:12,949 --> 00:24:14,417
Not a spot.

00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:22,025
Linds?

00:24:22,091 --> 00:24:23,493
Lindsey?

00:24:26,095 --> 00:24:27,530
Lindsey...

00:24:28,665 --> 00:24:30,400
Lindsey,
hi, honey!

00:24:30,466 --> 00:24:31,768
Mommy, hi!

00:24:31,834 --> 00:24:35,038
Oh, am I glad
to see you.

00:24:37,173 --> 00:24:39,342
Daddy came to ballet tonight.

00:24:39,409 --> 00:24:41,244
I know. I was
just there.

00:24:41,311 --> 00:24:44,747
Your teacher told me
Daddy came to pick you up.

00:24:44,814 --> 00:24:46,482
Oh, you feel so good.

00:24:48,484 --> 00:24:51,688
Ed... I'm working
this quadruple.

00:24:51,754 --> 00:24:54,090
Time got away from me.

00:24:54,157 --> 00:24:55,425
I apologize.

00:24:55,491 --> 00:24:58,027
I figured
that's probably what it was.

00:24:58,094 --> 00:25:01,164
When they couldn't reach you,
they called me.

00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:03,666
Yeah, thank you,
I really, really...

00:25:03,733 --> 00:25:05,001
Cath, Cath, Cath...

00:25:05,068 --> 00:25:06,669
She's my kid too, okay?

00:25:06,736 --> 00:25:08,004
All right?
Yeah.

00:25:08,071 --> 00:25:10,139
Oh...

00:25:10,206 --> 00:25:12,442
So, the case is bad?

00:25:12,508 --> 00:25:14,978
I saw it on the news.

00:25:16,913 --> 00:25:19,482
Hey...

00:25:19,549 --> 00:25:21,150
are you hungry?

00:25:21,217 --> 00:25:22,919
I made pancakes.

00:25:22,986 --> 00:25:24,954
You made pancakes?

00:25:25,021 --> 00:25:26,089
Mm-hmm.

00:25:26,155 --> 00:25:27,490
For dinner?

00:25:27,557 --> 00:25:28,858
Yeah.

00:25:28,925 --> 00:25:30,093
( <i>beeper sounding</i> )

00:25:34,497 --> 00:25:36,099
That would be Grissom.

00:25:36,165 --> 00:25:37,800
How is your boyfriend?

00:25:37,867 --> 00:25:40,203
Ed.

00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:41,437
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

00:25:41,504 --> 00:25:42,805
Yeah.

00:25:42,872 --> 00:25:43,840
Grissom, it's me.

00:25:43,906 --> 00:25:45,842
I need you back here right away.

00:25:45,908 --> 00:25:47,844
The Collins case is busting out.

00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:49,178
Okay, I'll be
right there.

00:25:49,245 --> 00:25:51,314
Just let me throw on
some clean clothes.

00:25:51,381 --> 00:25:53,016
Please do.

00:25:55,718 --> 00:25:57,687
Eddie...

00:25:58,888 --> 00:26:02,492
She's going to ask
where you are.

00:26:02,558 --> 00:26:04,960
She always does.

00:26:13,054 --> 00:26:14,288
Hey, Ecklie.

00:26:14,355 --> 00:26:16,057
I just got off the phone
with the Sheriff.

00:26:16,123 --> 00:26:17,058
He wants results, Gil.

00:26:17,124 --> 00:26:18,526
He should go to
a sports book.

00:26:18,593 --> 00:26:19,994
I hear the Stardust is good.

00:26:20,061 --> 00:26:22,063
He should go to his first team--
my team.

00:26:22,129 --> 00:26:24,131
Teams? I didn't know this
was a competition.

00:26:24,198 --> 00:26:26,267
Well, it is,
and my crew usually wins.

00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:27,702
Really?

00:26:27,768 --> 00:26:30,338
Didn't graveyard beat day shift
in softball last summer?

00:26:30,404 --> 00:26:32,173
You know,
you can joke all you want.

00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,341
It's your ass
on the line.

00:26:33,407 --> 00:26:35,243
I think it was 14-3.

00:26:35,309 --> 00:26:37,678
Like I said,
it's all about results

00:26:37,745 --> 00:26:39,347
and if you don't get them

00:26:39,413 --> 00:26:40,915
I will.

00:26:40,982 --> 00:26:43,351
The tire treads from the scooter

00:26:43,417 --> 00:26:45,119
place you at the scene
of the murders.

00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:46,587
Look, I was in Hoover

00:26:46,654 --> 00:26:47,922
visiting
my father.

00:26:47,989 --> 00:26:49,490
I don't know
about Tina's parents

00:26:49,557 --> 00:26:50,625
getting killed.

00:26:50,691 --> 00:26:53,828
Tina's parents?
So you know Tina Collins?

00:26:53,895 --> 00:26:54,762
Yeah, I know her.

00:26:54,829 --> 00:26:55,830
A lot of guys know her.

00:26:55,897 --> 00:26:56,831
She's a freak.

00:26:56,898 --> 00:26:58,032
You mean sexually?

00:26:58,099 --> 00:26:58,799
Yeah.

00:26:58,866 --> 00:27:01,269
Where's your scooter now?

00:27:01,335 --> 00:27:03,704
I told him I don't know.

00:27:03,771 --> 00:27:04,672
It disappeared?

00:27:04,739 --> 00:27:06,307
Look, it costs money, right?

00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:08,876
And my dad's been slacking
on support

00:27:08,943 --> 00:27:10,678
so I bought it with
three other guys.

00:27:10,745 --> 00:27:11,946
We share it.

00:27:12,013 --> 00:27:13,948
Here's a pen.

00:27:14,015 --> 00:27:15,550
Start writing.

00:27:20,421 --> 00:27:22,523
Hey, heard you have a suspect.

00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:25,893
We got about four
just on the tire prints alone.

00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,929
Homicide's grabbing them up.

00:27:27,995 --> 00:27:30,398
Let's talk about
what else we have.

00:27:30,464 --> 00:27:33,634
Tina Collins' pajama top
from the murder scene

00:27:33,701 --> 00:27:35,836
without a drop of blood on it.

00:27:35,903 --> 00:27:36,871
Hello.

00:27:36,938 --> 00:27:38,406
How does she
explain that?

00:27:38,472 --> 00:27:39,640
We're about to go ask her.

00:27:39,707 --> 00:27:40,975
Nick, what did you find out

00:27:41,042 --> 00:27:42,210
about that stuff
you collected

00:27:42,276 --> 00:27:43,644
at the back
of the house?

00:27:43,711 --> 00:27:44,512
The bidi?

00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:46,714
DNA's still processing,
but Tina said

00:27:46,781 --> 00:27:48,649
nobody in the family smoked.

00:27:48,716 --> 00:27:50,551
So a non-family member
was out there.

00:27:50,618 --> 00:27:51,552
Bidi? Bidi?

00:27:51,619 --> 00:27:53,421
I thought you found
a cigarette and a match

00:27:53,487 --> 00:27:54,355
behind the house.

00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:56,023
Well, it's just like
a cigarette.

00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:57,225
Kids smoke them.

00:27:57,291 --> 00:27:58,860
They think there's less
carbon monoxide.

00:27:58,926 --> 00:28:00,061
What did you find out

00:28:00,127 --> 00:28:02,330
about the psych exam
on the little girl?

00:28:02,396 --> 00:28:04,198
The shrink says the kid
is in a catatonic state

00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:05,199
from a trauma.

00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:07,034
I could've
told you that.

00:28:07,101 --> 00:28:10,738
But she did respond
to the name "Buffalo."

00:28:10,805 --> 00:28:13,107
Respond how?

00:28:13,174 --> 00:28:14,876
She freaked out.

00:28:19,247 --> 00:28:22,350
And... what are you
doing about it now?

00:28:22,416 --> 00:28:24,151
Going back to the girl.

00:28:24,218 --> 00:28:25,953
I left her in the car.

00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:30,691
The windows are cracked.

00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,495
Give me a little credit.

00:28:34,562 --> 00:28:36,230
She's at the hospital.

00:28:45,273 --> 00:28:48,075
I don't know why I didn't get
blood on my pajamas.

00:28:48,142 --> 00:28:49,243
I just didn't.

00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,511
But your statement says

00:28:50,578 --> 00:28:52,713
that you bent down
and hugged your mother

00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,215
who was bleeding profusely.

00:28:54,282 --> 00:28:56,617
Then you ran out,
tripping over

00:28:56,684 --> 00:29:00,421
your father's body
in the upstairs hallway.

00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:03,191
But there was no blood on you.

00:29:03,257 --> 00:29:05,826
I saw my family dead.

00:29:05,893 --> 00:29:07,461
I was scared.

00:29:07,528 --> 00:29:09,330
I ran to the neighbors.

00:29:12,433 --> 00:29:14,535
That is the truth.

00:29:18,172 --> 00:29:20,608
The evidence
is telling a different story.

00:29:23,211 --> 00:29:27,114
I did the nasty with her, yeah,
but I didn't kill her family.

00:29:27,181 --> 00:29:28,749
Besides

00:29:28,816 --> 00:29:31,052
my dad grounded me last week.

00:29:31,118 --> 00:29:32,820
I share the scooter
with Oliver

00:29:32,887 --> 00:29:34,922
but I was camping last night.

00:29:34,989 --> 00:29:36,891
Ask my mom. She made me go.

00:29:36,958 --> 00:29:38,960
Church group.

00:29:39,026 --> 00:29:40,928
We had sex. So what?

00:29:40,995 --> 00:29:42,463
I want a lawyer.

00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:44,498
You want a lawyer?
Okay, we'll get you a lawyer.

00:29:44,565 --> 00:29:46,634
Investigator Stokes

00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:49,237
will stay with you
just in case you remember

00:29:49,303 --> 00:29:51,038
where you left
that scooter.

00:30:01,315 --> 00:30:04,085
There's no smoking
in here.

00:30:04,151 --> 00:30:06,487
Sharon Stone--
<i>Basic Instinct,</i> dude.

00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:08,322
Yeah, and I'm not your <i>dude.</i>

00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:10,191
This ain't a movie

00:30:10,258 --> 00:30:11,826
and Sharon Stone's fine, so...

00:30:21,135 --> 00:30:22,303
Matches?

00:30:30,945 --> 00:30:32,980
The kid's name is Jesse Overton.

00:30:33,047 --> 00:30:35,816
He time-shares
the scooter.

00:30:35,883 --> 00:30:37,518
He admits to having sex
with your girl

00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:38,953
and he's asking for a lawyer.

00:30:41,122 --> 00:30:43,090
I want to get a warrant
and search his house.

00:30:44,892 --> 00:30:46,160
I'll keep you posted.

00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:51,365
I want to see my sister.

00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:52,833
It's not going to happen, Tina.

00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,236
It's a little too
late to start
coaching her now.

00:30:55,303 --> 00:30:56,204
You don't understand.

00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:57,338
I need
to speak with her.

00:30:57,405 --> 00:30:58,339
She won't speak.

00:30:58,406 --> 00:31:00,374
The doctor says
it's from trauma.

00:31:01,843 --> 00:31:03,110
What happened, Tina?

00:31:04,745 --> 00:31:07,381
Did you catch your boyfriend
killing your family?

00:31:18,426 --> 00:31:21,562
Stokes:
Ha-ha-ha.
Houston, we have lift-off.

00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:23,130
Let me take a look.

00:31:25,733 --> 00:31:28,336
You see how each half
of the match lines up?

00:31:28,402 --> 00:31:29,837
I see.

00:31:29,904 --> 00:31:32,540
Ah... who broke
the case?

00:31:32,607 --> 00:31:33,674
Well, if you believe

00:31:33,741 --> 00:31:35,710
what you hear in the halls--
Ecklie.

00:31:35,776 --> 00:31:38,246
Ecklie?

00:31:38,312 --> 00:31:40,114
Day shift.
Day shift.

00:31:40,181 --> 00:31:41,883
Sophisticated criminal, huh?

00:31:43,184 --> 00:31:45,253
Hmm?

00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:47,555
This is the
getaway vehicle.

00:31:47,622 --> 00:31:51,158
Tossing it in his own trash?
What else is new?

00:31:51,225 --> 00:31:53,494
Whoa.

00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,865
Is this
a pair of jeans

00:31:57,932 --> 00:31:58,733
under all that blood?

00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:00,601
"Yet who would have thought

00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:03,504
the old man to have
so much blood in him?"

00:32:03,571 --> 00:32:05,106
What was that?

00:32:05,172 --> 00:32:07,208
That's Shakespeare.

00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:18,352
The lawyer's
pleading him guilty.

00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:19,787
Had to, once I put

00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:21,689
the murder weapon in his mug.

00:32:21,756 --> 00:32:23,991
Man:
Remember--
yes or no.

00:32:24,058 --> 00:32:25,259
Got it.

00:32:25,326 --> 00:32:27,261
Did Tina Collins
approach you at school

00:32:27,328 --> 00:32:28,930
and ask you
to kill her family?

00:32:30,364 --> 00:32:31,999
Yes.

00:32:32,066 --> 00:32:34,068
Would you lie
about that

00:32:34,135 --> 00:32:36,637
to escape the
death penalty?

00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:39,340
No.

00:32:39,407 --> 00:32:41,943
Did you kill
her family?

00:32:45,479 --> 00:32:47,682
Yes.

00:32:47,748 --> 00:32:49,417
Did Tina let you
in the front door

00:32:49,483 --> 00:32:50,785
the night
of the killings?

00:32:50,852 --> 00:32:53,588
2:00. I waited
till it was straight up.

00:32:58,759 --> 00:33:00,261
Man:
Yes or no?

00:33:01,596 --> 00:33:03,764
Sorry.

00:33:03,831 --> 00:33:05,299
Yes.

00:33:05,366 --> 00:33:08,769
Man:
<i>Did she already have a knife</i>
<i>for you?</i>

00:33:08,836 --> 00:33:11,005
Overton:
<i>No, she let me choose.</i>

00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:15,343
Man:
<i>Did you use that knife</i>
<i>to kill Barbara Collins?</i>

00:33:15,409 --> 00:33:17,778
Yes.

00:33:23,317 --> 00:33:26,521
And Mr. Collins?

00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:28,256
Yes.

00:33:32,193 --> 00:33:35,196
And both sons?

00:33:37,832 --> 00:33:39,667
Yes.

00:33:39,734 --> 00:33:41,602
Was Tina mad

00:33:41,669 --> 00:33:45,439
at her parents
for not letting you
see each other?

00:33:45,506 --> 00:33:48,276
Yes.

00:33:48,342 --> 00:33:51,145
Did Tina Collins tell you
she wanted them dead

00:33:51,212 --> 00:33:53,047
so you could see each other?

00:33:56,918 --> 00:33:58,052
Yes.

00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:05,026
Well, the sick bastard
is on the up and up.

00:34:05,092 --> 00:34:06,761
Except your
last question.

00:34:06,827 --> 00:34:07,995
Why?

00:34:08,062 --> 00:34:10,198
That they killed the family
so they could be together?

00:34:10,264 --> 00:34:11,866
Operator says
his respiratory reactions

00:34:11,933 --> 00:34:14,168
were inconsistent.

00:34:14,235 --> 00:34:15,903
He's lying.

00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:18,005
Stokes:
We got them both.

00:34:18,072 --> 00:34:19,407
I don't much care
why they did it.

00:34:19,473 --> 00:34:20,708
I'm with you there.

00:34:20,775 --> 00:34:23,044
I care.

00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:24,612
I don't like holes.

00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:27,703
What are they hiding?

00:34:37,176 --> 00:34:39,612
Did you collect the property
from the Collins family?

00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:42,215
Right after the autopsies;
sealed them myself. Why?

00:34:42,281 --> 00:34:45,284
I told one of your assistants
to make sure that I got them.

00:34:45,351 --> 00:34:46,586
Well, I gave
them to Ecklie.

00:34:46,652 --> 00:34:48,187
He said he'd
deliver them to you.

00:34:48,254 --> 00:34:51,858
He was down here
on another case.

00:34:57,530 --> 00:34:59,165
Ecklie!

00:34:59,232 --> 00:35:02,368
I want everything right now.

00:35:02,435 --> 00:35:04,036
I've been going over it.

00:35:04,103 --> 00:35:06,005
The Collins case
is my shift.

00:35:06,072 --> 00:35:07,373
You are completely off base.

00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,641
What, you're afraid

00:35:08,708 --> 00:35:10,309
I'll find something
that might show you up?

00:35:10,376 --> 00:35:12,178
Oh, I'm sure if you could

00:35:12,245 --> 00:35:13,579
you would have by now.

00:35:13,646 --> 00:35:14,447
Where is it?

00:35:17,083 --> 00:35:18,217
I don't care
that you got

00:35:18,284 --> 00:35:19,852
some pimply-faced
kid to confess.

00:35:19,919 --> 00:35:21,187
You kept
the Sheriff

00:35:21,254 --> 00:35:22,355
out of the loop.

00:35:22,421 --> 00:35:23,689
That's a career-killer, Gil.

00:35:23,756 --> 00:35:26,192
That's what so sad, Conrad.

00:35:26,259 --> 00:35:29,061
You think of this as a career.

00:36:00,259 --> 00:36:04,564
The buffalo.

00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:06,065
Yeah?
Sara.

00:36:06,132 --> 00:36:07,867
When they examined
the little Collins girl

00:36:07,934 --> 00:36:09,602
did they check for sexual abuse?

00:36:09,669 --> 00:36:12,171
Sara:
<i>There were no overt signs. Why?</i>

00:36:12,238 --> 00:36:15,241
Grissom:
<i>Have some ultraviolet</i>
<i>photographs taken.</i>

00:36:15,308 --> 00:36:18,077
This... is a very
special camera.

00:36:18,144 --> 00:36:20,780
It can see deep
into your skin.

00:36:20,847 --> 00:36:23,649
It can see things
nobody can see.

00:36:23,716 --> 00:36:27,653
How about I take a picture
of me first, okay?

00:36:29,655 --> 00:36:31,424
See?

00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:33,359
It's okay.

00:36:50,343 --> 00:36:51,644
Are you ready?

00:36:53,212 --> 00:36:54,680
Okay.

00:36:58,985 --> 00:37:04,557
Notes on mapping: Collins family
murder, case #00-398.

00:37:04,624 --> 00:37:06,526
Intruder killed mother.

00:37:06,592 --> 00:37:11,364
Father went to protect
the little girl.

00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:14,767
Got nicked by knife.

00:37:14,834 --> 00:37:16,202
Killer subdued him

00:37:16,269 --> 00:37:22,508
as dad was entering
the little girl's room to...

00:37:22,575 --> 00:37:24,744
...save her.

00:38:02,448 --> 00:38:04,917
( <i>knocking</i> )

00:38:04,984 --> 00:38:06,385
Catherine Willows?

00:38:06,452 --> 00:38:07,520
Who's asking?

00:38:07,587 --> 00:38:09,522
Ted Goggle.
I'm with Family Services.

00:38:09,589 --> 00:38:12,725
Were you working
the Collins case?

00:38:12,792 --> 00:38:15,928
You know, your department can't
seem to get things straight.

00:38:15,995 --> 00:38:18,531
If you're looking
for the little girl

00:38:18,598 --> 00:38:20,399
she's already got a case worker.

00:38:20,466 --> 00:38:22,034
I'm inquiring
about <i>your</i> little girl.

00:38:22,101 --> 00:38:25,037
My Lindsay? Why?
What are you talking about?

00:38:25,104 --> 00:38:26,606
Your husband, Eddie

00:38:26,672 --> 00:38:28,341
filed a report

00:38:28,407 --> 00:38:30,276
says you neglected
to pick her up

00:38:30,343 --> 00:38:31,911
after dance class
last night

00:38:31,978 --> 00:38:33,713
that you routinely
neglect her

00:38:33,779 --> 00:38:35,081
for your job.

00:38:35,147 --> 00:38:37,350
Is this Eddie's idea of a joke?

00:38:37,416 --> 00:38:39,585
What, are you in
one of his bands?

00:38:39,652 --> 00:38:42,622
I already made a field visit
to your house. Here's the form.

00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:46,559
Lindsay seems okay

00:38:46,626 --> 00:38:49,862
but there is going to be
an investigation

00:38:49,929 --> 00:38:52,231
as to whether there
was parental neglect.

00:38:52,298 --> 00:38:54,200
You're on notice.

00:39:00,506 --> 00:39:03,876
( <i>phone rings</i> )

00:39:03,943 --> 00:39:05,578
Grissom.

00:39:05,645 --> 00:39:09,215
It's me.
Something's off on the map.

00:39:09,282 --> 00:39:11,017
Off? How?

00:39:11,083 --> 00:39:14,420
Uh, I'm looking at dad's blood
in the hall.

00:39:14,487 --> 00:39:16,989
I found an interesting drop.

00:39:17,056 --> 00:39:18,824
The droplet tells me

00:39:18,891 --> 00:39:21,294
that he wasn't running
to the little girl's room.

00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,162
He was coming out of it?

00:39:23,229 --> 00:39:24,931
Yeah.

00:39:24,997 --> 00:39:28,234
<i>I filled one of your holes,</i>
<i>Grissom.</i>

00:39:28,301 --> 00:39:32,171
<i>He killed the father,</i>
<i>then killed the mother.</i>

00:39:32,238 --> 00:39:34,774
<i>The dad's blood</i>
<i>we found in the hallway</i>

00:39:34,841 --> 00:39:37,476
<i>must've dripped off</i>
<i>the killer's knife.</i>

00:39:51,157 --> 00:39:53,292
Damn it.

00:39:59,565 --> 00:40:01,634
Look at all those bruises.

00:40:01,701 --> 00:40:04,504
Grissom:
Somebody was all over this kid.

00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:07,373
We have forensic evidence

00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,978
that your father
sexually abused your sister.

00:40:12,044 --> 00:40:14,046
We also know...

00:40:14,113 --> 00:40:19,952
that he was in
her room the night
of the murders.

00:40:20,019 --> 00:40:21,687
How can you tell?

00:40:21,754 --> 00:40:24,290
Blood drops.

00:40:24,357 --> 00:40:29,061
They fall a
certain way

00:40:29,128 --> 00:40:31,297
depending on the motion
of the victim.

00:40:35,234 --> 00:40:39,605
Something horrible happened
in that house, didn't it, Tina?

00:40:43,476 --> 00:40:45,411
Long before the night
of the murders.

00:40:49,382 --> 00:40:53,886
That was the last night
he was going to touch her.

00:40:53,953 --> 00:40:56,255
But why your mother

00:40:56,322 --> 00:40:58,758
and why your brothers?

00:40:58,824 --> 00:41:05,131
Because they should've
protected <i>me.</i>

00:41:07,333 --> 00:41:08,868
You?

00:41:11,671 --> 00:41:13,739
My father...

00:41:36,028 --> 00:41:37,964
I was young.

00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:40,800
I learned to deal

00:41:40,867 --> 00:41:44,570
but when he went
for my daughter...

00:41:49,775 --> 00:41:52,411
Brenda is...?

00:42:01,153 --> 00:42:02,588
And who is...

00:42:02,655 --> 00:42:04,590
The father?

00:42:06,492 --> 00:42:11,764
I was 13...

00:42:11,831 --> 00:42:13,432
and nobody noticed

00:42:13,499 --> 00:42:16,135
that my clothes
were getting bigger.

00:42:20,339 --> 00:42:22,642
Nice, huh?

00:42:28,648 --> 00:42:32,785
Brenda may hate me
for what I did...

00:42:32,852 --> 00:42:35,321
but I protected her.

00:42:38,191 --> 00:42:40,827
I did that much.

00:43:05,518 --> 00:43:07,086
Night, guys.

00:43:07,153 --> 00:43:09,989
See you, Cath. Good work.

00:43:13,493 --> 00:43:16,929
It'll be back to normal
in 24 hours.

00:43:17,135 --> 00:43:18,694
Normal'd be nice.
