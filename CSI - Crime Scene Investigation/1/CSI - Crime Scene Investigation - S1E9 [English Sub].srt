00:00:17,583 --> 00:00:19,585
Pilot:
<i>McCarren approach</i>

00:00:19,585 --> 00:00:20,792
<i>Las Vegas Nine-Zero-Nine,</i>
<i>30,000.</i>

00:00:20,792 --> 00:00:22,417
<i>Request emergency personnel.</i>
<i>Over.</i>

00:00:22,417 --> 00:00:25,333
<i>Las Vegas Nine-Zero-Nine,</i>
<i>McCarren Tower.</i>

00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:28,136
<i>Specify request. Over.</i>

00:00:28,202 --> 00:00:29,625
<i>Negative, McCarren.</i>
<i>Advise on runway.</i>

00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:32,261
<i>Las Vegas Nine-Zero-Nine</i>

00:00:32,327 --> 00:00:34,208

<i>One-Five approach.</i>

00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:35,643
<i>Over.</i>

00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:37,583
<i>V-O-R Runway One-Five approach.</i>
<i>Roger.</i>

00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:39,041
<i>Request Las Vegas Police.</i>

00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:41,010
<i>Understand-- "police"?</i>

00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,411
<i>Roger.</i>

00:00:42,478 --> 00:00:43,613
Mommy!

00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:45,681
( <i>groaning</i> )

00:00:56,792 --> 00:00:58,261
Brass:
<i>Luggage stays in the plane.</i>

00:00:58,327 --> 00:01:00,096
<i>We're going to treat this</i>
<i>like a crime scene</i>

00:01:00,163 --> 00:01:02,498
<i>until we're told otherwise.</i>

00:01:02,565 --> 00:01:04,233
Tim, Sam, talk
to the coach passengers.

00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,434
See what you can't learn.

00:01:05,501 --> 00:01:06,936
All right, look
I'm going to talk

00:01:07,003 --> 00:01:09,272
to the first class passengers
that are in the lounge.

00:01:09,338 --> 00:01:11,474
Let's meet back there
in a half an hour, all right?

00:01:15,144 --> 00:01:18,648
So... dead guy
in first class?

00:01:18,714 --> 00:01:20,383
Las Vegas Air.

00:01:20,449 --> 00:01:23,553
Always heard it
was a good time.

00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,992
( <i>clears throat</i> )

00:01:32,261 --> 00:01:34,363
Coroner pronounce?

00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:35,998
About 30 minutes ago.

00:01:36,065 --> 00:01:37,266
Eyewitnesses?

00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:39,068
Everyone in the
first class--

00:01:39,135 --> 00:01:41,737
Nine passengers,
one flight attendant.

00:01:41,804 --> 00:01:43,840
Where are they now?
Sequestered
in the lounge.

00:01:43,906 --> 00:01:46,709
According to the flight crew,
the deceased had some sort
of panic attack

00:01:46,776 --> 00:01:49,245
and died before
they landed.

00:01:55,785 --> 00:01:59,489
Point of disturbance:
cockpit door.

00:01:59,555 --> 00:02:01,991
Bloody handprint.

00:02:04,961 --> 00:02:07,597
Looks like foot impression.

00:02:07,663 --> 00:02:09,165
Ballpark shoe size...

00:02:09,232 --> 00:02:11,567
ten to 11.

00:02:21,477 --> 00:02:24,714
Deceased found lying
between rows one and two.

00:02:38,127 --> 00:02:40,429
What is that, blood?

00:02:42,098 --> 00:02:44,367
I want this whole
plane taped off...

00:02:44,433 --> 00:02:46,335
nose to tail
and wing to wing.

00:02:46,402 --> 00:02:48,171
Oh, it's going to
take a lot of tape.

00:02:48,237 --> 00:02:51,507
I've got a dead body,
a crime scene with wings.

00:02:51,574 --> 00:02:54,677
Something very wrong
happened in this plane.

We've got a whale of an
opportunity here, Gil.

00:03:51,882 --> 00:03:54,618
Dead body on an airplane--
F.A.A. has jurisdiction.

00:03:54,685 --> 00:03:56,853
But the feds won't be
here till sunrise.

00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,223
That gives us about 12
hours to be heroes.

00:03:59,289 --> 00:04:00,657
I don't follow you.

00:04:00,724 --> 00:04:02,492
Well, we either
hand over

00:04:02,559 --> 00:04:04,795
the guy who did it
when the feds get here

00:04:04,861 --> 00:04:06,396
or we give them
all the glory

00:04:06,463 --> 00:04:08,332
while we watch
from the sidelines.

00:04:08,398 --> 00:04:10,400
I don't even know if
we have a homicide yet.

00:04:10,467 --> 00:04:12,436
First reports indicate...

00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,338
he had some kind
of an episode.

00:04:14,404 --> 00:04:15,639
Give me a little credit.

00:04:15,706 --> 00:04:17,975
Even you wouldn't tape off
one of these wide-bodies

00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:19,376
unless you knew
you had something.

00:04:19,443 --> 00:04:21,411
Arrest would be
good for you.

00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:24,581
It would be good for me too,
good for Las Vegas.

00:04:24,648 --> 00:04:27,618
You running for mayor?

00:04:32,422 --> 00:04:34,658
What about the passengers
in coach?

00:04:34,725 --> 00:04:36,560
Did they see anything?

00:04:36,627 --> 00:04:38,061
Brass said the curtain was shut.

00:04:38,128 --> 00:04:40,230
Flight attendant kept them
separated. They disembarked

00:04:40,297 --> 00:04:41,331
through the rear.

00:04:41,398 --> 00:04:43,800
What do we know
about the dead guy?

00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:45,535
Tony Candlewell, age 30.

00:04:45,602 --> 00:04:47,738
Communications company manager

00:04:47,804 --> 00:04:49,640
from Atlanta, married...

00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,642
no record.

00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:55,112
So?

00:04:55,178 --> 00:04:56,780
What do you think?

00:04:56,847 --> 00:04:58,181
Catherine:
I don't know...

00:04:58,248 --> 00:05:00,751
but this sure must have looked
scary at 30,000 feet.

00:05:00,817 --> 00:05:03,086
Warrick:
All this done by one guy?

00:05:03,153 --> 00:05:04,621
Had to be on drugs.

00:05:04,688 --> 00:05:07,424
Too much damage for one guy.

00:05:07,491 --> 00:05:10,260
So, more than one guy?
What do you think, Gris?

00:05:10,327 --> 00:05:14,197
I think we've got ten witnesses
all singing the same song.

00:05:14,264 --> 00:05:15,666
The deceased
went berserk.

00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,434
Unless we find
something else

00:05:17,501 --> 00:05:19,269
in the evidence,
that's what happened.

00:05:19,336 --> 00:05:21,138
Catherine.

00:05:21,204 --> 00:05:22,673
I'll start
the interviews.
Thank you.

00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,841
Warrick, go with.

00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:26,610
Brass has them all assembled
in the lounge.

00:05:26,677 --> 00:05:27,945
Assume evidence
on everyone.

00:05:28,011 --> 00:05:31,481
Nick, go with the coroner.
Sara and I will work the plane.

00:05:31,548 --> 00:05:32,683
This is a mobile crime scene.

00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,017
It might not be here tomorrow.

00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:47,497
Miss, my daughter has
to go to the bathroom.

00:05:47,564 --> 00:05:49,466
Okay. I'll see
what I can do.

00:05:49,533 --> 00:05:52,002
Thank you.

00:05:52,069 --> 00:05:54,605
How are you holding up?

00:05:54,671 --> 00:05:56,039
I'm still shaking.

00:06:09,253 --> 00:06:10,320
Could I have your attention?

00:06:10,387 --> 00:06:11,521
I'm Jim Brass from Homicide.

00:06:11,588 --> 00:06:13,423
This is Catherine Willows
and Warrick Brown

00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:14,758
from Las Vegas
Criminalistics.

00:06:14,825 --> 00:06:16,360
They're here to
gather evidence.

00:06:16,426 --> 00:06:18,562
You know you can't keep us here.

00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:21,265
Sir, we realize
this is an imposition,
and we apologize for it.

00:06:21,331 --> 00:06:23,533
Nobody wants to see you on
your way more than we do.

00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,335
We'll make this as
quick and painless

00:06:25,402 --> 00:06:26,937
as we possibly can.

00:06:27,004 --> 00:06:29,439
Man:
Okay.

00:06:29,506 --> 00:06:31,575
Nice snow job.

00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:33,977
More flies with honey.

00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:39,883
Driver's license...

00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:42,119
library card...

00:06:42,185 --> 00:06:43,921
organ donor card.

00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:45,155
Stand-up guy.

00:06:47,591 --> 00:06:48,692
He had a family.

00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:50,861
Can you imagine getting
that phone call?

00:06:50,928 --> 00:06:53,363
What a shame.

00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,232
David...

00:06:55,299 --> 00:06:57,834
It's always a shame.

00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:03,607
Man:
I saw him board.

00:07:03,674 --> 00:07:05,442
He seemed like
an okay guy.

00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:07,077
Here, let me help
you with that.

00:07:07,144 --> 00:07:08,645
Oh, thank you.

00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:11,648
Thank you very much.

00:07:11,715 --> 00:07:13,350
Sure, no problem.

00:07:13,417 --> 00:07:15,185
When did you become aware

00:07:15,252 --> 00:07:17,087
that there was a problem
in the cabin?

00:07:17,154 --> 00:07:19,256
1630 hours, about
35 minutes out.

00:07:19,323 --> 00:07:20,757
Shannon asked one
of us to come out

00:07:20,824 --> 00:07:22,392
and address an issue
with a passenger.

00:07:22,459 --> 00:07:24,962
What's the problem,
Shannon?

00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:26,563
Hello.

00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:30,534
Do me a favor: Go back to coach.
Make sure no one comes forward.

00:07:30,601 --> 00:07:31,935
Thanks.

00:07:32,002 --> 00:07:34,271
Come on, it's
been ten minutes!
Sir...

00:07:34,338 --> 00:07:35,772
is there some way
we can assist you?

00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:37,140
You can help me
open this door.

00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:38,275
There are two other

00:07:38,342 --> 00:07:40,077
restrooms towards
the rear of the plane.

00:07:40,143 --> 00:07:44,248
I paid $1,200 to pee
here, not in coach.

00:07:44,314 --> 00:07:45,983
Sir? You need to
take your seat.

00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:47,684
How much time did you spend
with him?

00:07:47,751 --> 00:07:49,920
Two minutes.

00:07:49,987 --> 00:07:52,589
In that time
did you notice anything

00:07:52,656 --> 00:07:54,157
that would explain
his behavior?

00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:56,226
Was he drunk maybe, or on drugs?

00:07:56,293 --> 00:07:57,694
Not as far as I could tell.

00:07:57,761 --> 00:07:59,263
A little agitated.

00:07:59,329 --> 00:08:02,432
It's not like I haven't seen
this kind of behavior before.

00:08:02,499 --> 00:08:05,202
Flying just makes people react
in funny ways.

00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,977
Is that a meat thermometer?

00:08:14,044 --> 00:08:17,381
Digital readout.
Bigger numbers.

00:08:19,516 --> 00:08:21,418
98.1.

00:08:21,485 --> 00:08:24,488
Guy should be
colder than that.

00:08:24,555 --> 00:08:26,056
Body temperature
drops two degrees

00:08:26,123 --> 00:08:27,424
in the first hour
after death

00:08:27,491 --> 00:08:29,927
then one and a half degrees
for each successive hour.

00:08:29,993 --> 00:08:32,429
Well, he's been dead
for two hours.

00:08:32,496 --> 00:08:35,032
That would make his temperature
at the time of death...

00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:36,667
101.6.

00:08:36,733 --> 00:08:39,603
This guy had a fever.

00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:43,774
Let's see what
else we've got.

00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,311
Petecchial hemorrhaging
behind the eyes...

00:08:47,377 --> 00:08:50,347
suggesting suffocation
of some sort.

00:08:50,414 --> 00:08:52,015
Horseshoe-shaped contusion

00:08:52,082 --> 00:08:53,550
on the left side of the neck.

00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:55,819
Looks like the heel of a boot.

00:08:55,886 --> 00:08:58,589
Oh, I'll buy that-- for now.

00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,492
Multiple contusions
front and back.

00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:04,361
Broken hand.

00:09:04,428 --> 00:09:07,998
Well, this guy's a study
in contradictions.

00:09:08,065 --> 00:09:10,367
He's got defensive wounds
on his palms

00:09:10,434 --> 00:09:12,302
but the scrapes on his knuckles

00:09:12,369 --> 00:09:14,838
and the broken hand
indicate aggression.

00:09:24,948 --> 00:09:27,885
Grissom:
Dr. Kiera Behrle, 3E.

00:09:27,951 --> 00:09:29,453
Emily Behrle, 3F.

00:09:31,889 --> 00:09:33,490
Nate Metz, 2C.

00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:39,830
Nate Metz.

00:09:39,897 --> 00:09:42,566
Put your seat back and tray
table in their upright position.

00:09:42,633 --> 00:09:44,001
I don't think so.

00:09:44,067 --> 00:09:46,436
Let me guess who
was sitting in 3C.

00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:48,839
Tony Candlewell.

00:09:48,906 --> 00:09:50,774
The dead guy.

00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:52,376
Look, the guy was a real ass.

00:09:52,442 --> 00:09:54,244
In what way?

00:09:54,311 --> 00:09:57,381
Look, you know why
I fly first class?

00:09:57,447 --> 00:09:59,483
Other than the fact
that my company pays for it?

00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,018
Because I can work.
I have to work.

00:10:01,084 --> 00:10:04,054
And he wouldn't let you?

00:10:04,121 --> 00:10:06,056
No, he, he, he kept kicking
the back of my seat

00:10:06,123 --> 00:10:07,558
with his foot.

00:10:07,624 --> 00:10:08,892
You know, like in
a movie theater

00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,294
when somebody's
kicking your seat?

00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,329
Imagine that all the way
from Atlanta to Las Vegas.

00:10:12,396 --> 00:10:13,463
Catherine:
Are you telling me

00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,698
this guy was
kicking the back

00:10:14,765 --> 00:10:16,600
of your seat
the entire flight?

00:10:16,667 --> 00:10:18,235
Maybe not the entire flight.

00:10:18,302 --> 00:10:20,904
You know, like, like Dallas
to, to Las Vegas.

00:10:25,309 --> 00:10:29,313
Hey, Pele, could you please stop
kicking the back of my seat?

00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:30,847
I wasn't doing anything.

00:10:30,914 --> 00:10:32,149
You know exactly

00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:34,151
what you're doing. Stop it.

00:10:35,352 --> 00:10:36,587
What did you do?

00:10:36,653 --> 00:10:38,288
I ju... I ignored him.

00:10:38,355 --> 00:10:42,459
You know, I punched the seat
a couple times in anger

00:10:42,526 --> 00:10:44,294
and that's it.

00:10:44,361 --> 00:10:46,096
Look, the guy set me off.

00:10:46,163 --> 00:10:48,332
It was either the seat or him.

00:10:49,967 --> 00:10:51,668
May I see your hands?

00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:57,507
Your knuckles are
pretty banged up.

00:11:07,184 --> 00:11:09,853
Blood drops...

00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:14,491
away from the
main event.

00:11:14,558 --> 00:11:16,360
Maybe that's where
the action started.

00:11:17,694 --> 00:11:19,863
Could just be a bloody nose.

00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:27,070
Who was sitting in 4B?

00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:32,242
Lou Everett.

00:11:38,649 --> 00:11:40,551
Lou Everett?

00:11:41,885 --> 00:11:43,687
Yeah.
How'd you get

00:11:43,754 --> 00:11:45,322
that slice around the chops?

00:11:45,389 --> 00:11:47,624
The guy swung at me with a C.D.

00:11:47,691 --> 00:11:50,527
Put his finger
in the hole and slashed me.

00:11:50,594 --> 00:11:52,296
What guy?

00:11:52,362 --> 00:11:53,997
That crazy guy, the psycho.

00:11:54,064 --> 00:11:55,566
He was out of his mind.

00:11:57,801 --> 00:12:00,537
What the hell is
wrong with you?

00:12:00,604 --> 00:12:01,471
You know, you owe me

00:12:01,538 --> 00:12:03,206
another laptop, pal.
( <i>mumbles</i> )

00:12:03,273 --> 00:12:04,408
Hey!
Everett:
Hey, hey.

00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:05,976
We're in mid-
flight now, guys.

00:12:06,043 --> 00:12:06,910
That's enough.

00:12:12,282 --> 00:12:14,017
So what do you think?

00:12:14,084 --> 00:12:17,254
Bodily injury...
can I sue a dead man?

00:12:17,321 --> 00:12:19,189
I think you need some coffee.

00:12:19,256 --> 00:12:20,857
What do you mean?

00:12:20,924 --> 00:12:22,259
A few cocktails
on the plane, Lou?

00:12:22,326 --> 00:12:25,262
Look, I get nervous when I fly,
so what?

00:12:25,329 --> 00:12:27,497
Well, alcohol does
different things

00:12:27,564 --> 00:12:30,500
to different people...
at different altitudes.

00:12:30,567 --> 00:12:31,768
Hey, I was fine.

00:12:31,835 --> 00:12:33,237
He went bananas.

00:12:33,303 --> 00:12:36,173
Why don't you just ask...
ask the flight attendant?

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,041
So, we were about
35 minutes out...

00:12:38,108 --> 00:12:41,078
when he started pressing his
call button over and over.

00:12:41,144 --> 00:12:42,913
He was complaining
of a headache.

00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,414
And did you
give him anything?

00:12:44,481 --> 00:12:46,717
Yeah, I gave him
a packet of aspirin

00:12:46,783 --> 00:12:48,719
and he popped it
dry, no water.

00:12:48,785 --> 00:12:50,554
Catherine:
And, as far
as you know...

00:12:50,621 --> 00:12:52,689
did he complain
of a headache
when he boarded?

00:12:52,756 --> 00:12:54,224
No.

00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:56,260
So what made the worm turn?

00:12:56,326 --> 00:12:58,362
Look, I've been flying
for ten years.

00:12:58,428 --> 00:13:00,063
You know, I have seen it all.

00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:03,634
I've seen ferrets in suitcases,
uh, fellatio in first class...

00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,270
passengers stir-frying
on their tray tables.

00:13:06,336 --> 00:13:08,138
I mean...

00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:10,440
Who knows why anyone
does anything?

00:13:10,507 --> 00:13:12,309
Right.

00:13:12,376 --> 00:13:13,911
Well, thanks for your time.

00:13:13,977 --> 00:13:15,212
Thank you.

00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:16,680
Thanks.

00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:25,556
So, any bites?

00:13:25,622 --> 00:13:27,624
Nada. You?

00:13:27,691 --> 00:13:29,826
If nothing criminal happened
on that flight...

00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:31,428
why isn't anybody talking to us?

00:13:31,495 --> 00:13:33,830
I'm going to go
out on a limb here...

00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:36,166
and say... they're
hiding something?

00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:38,575
Then we get to play
hide-and-seek.

00:13:53,938 --> 00:13:55,573
I just got off the phone
with Nick.

00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,242
The coroner did some carving
on our dead guy.

00:13:58,309 --> 00:14:01,312
He found intercranial bleeding,
thoracic hemorrhaging

00:14:01,379 --> 00:14:02,914
a ruptured spleen.

00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,015
And for what it's worth

00:14:04,082 --> 00:14:05,416
the guy also had a fever.

00:14:06,751 --> 00:14:08,419
Did you find anything
interesting?

00:14:08,486 --> 00:14:12,423
Well, the guy in 4B was
knocking them back pretty good.

00:14:36,748 --> 00:14:38,683
Could be dried blood.

00:14:41,419 --> 00:14:43,221
Victim had

00:14:43,287 --> 00:14:45,022
defensive wounds on his hand.

00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:49,227
Marlene Valdez
was sitting in 2E.

00:14:49,293 --> 00:14:50,228
Look at me.

00:14:50,294 --> 00:14:51,462
my blouse is ruined.

00:14:51,529 --> 00:14:52,530
Just hope it washes out.

00:14:52,597 --> 00:14:53,598
We'll get you
a new one.

00:14:53,664 --> 00:14:55,099
Marlene:
After I saved

00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:57,034
your life, you better.
Brass:
Mr. Valdez

00:14:57,101 --> 00:14:58,102
was your life in danger?

00:14:58,169 --> 00:14:59,103
Well, you know...

00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:01,105
Of course his life
was in danger.

00:15:01,172 --> 00:15:02,874
That maniac was

00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,243
pacing up and down the aisles.

00:15:05,309 --> 00:15:06,277
All sweating.

00:15:06,344 --> 00:15:07,678
His eyes were glazed.

00:15:07,745 --> 00:15:10,081
I was sure he was going
to hijack that plane.

00:15:10,148 --> 00:15:11,916
Everyone needs to return
to their seats.

00:15:11,983 --> 00:15:13,017
( <i>cups rattling</i> )

00:15:13,084 --> 00:15:14,152
Do something.

00:15:14,218 --> 00:15:16,354
No, we should just
mind our own business.

00:15:16,421 --> 00:15:18,356
Well, if you don't
do something, I will.

00:15:18,423 --> 00:15:21,225
Uh... Ex-excuse me, sir.

00:15:21,292 --> 00:15:22,894
Uh... why don't you just

00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,961
take a seat?

00:15:25,196 --> 00:15:27,532
( <i>crashing</i> )

00:15:27,598 --> 00:15:31,602
Grissom:
The other half
of the wine bottle... from 2E.

00:15:33,704 --> 00:15:37,542
So... Marlene in 2E
slashes the victim.

00:15:37,608 --> 00:15:39,143
He's bleeding...

00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:40,745
where does he go?

00:15:40,812 --> 00:15:42,980
The lavatory.

00:15:54,692 --> 00:15:55,793
No evidence.

00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,428
No.

00:15:57,495 --> 00:15:58,429
No "patent" evidence.

00:15:58,496 --> 00:15:59,764
But if there's blood present

00:15:59,831 --> 00:16:01,632
there maybe latent evidence.

00:16:04,202 --> 00:16:06,471
One step ahead of you,
every so often.

00:16:06,537 --> 00:16:07,839
Thank you.

00:16:17,048 --> 00:16:19,217
Well.

00:16:21,085 --> 00:16:23,688
Would you hand me
the Christopher Columbus

00:16:23,755 --> 00:16:25,456
from my field kit?

00:16:30,061 --> 00:16:31,729
Thank you.

00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,632
( <i>clicks</i> )

00:16:42,907 --> 00:16:44,041
I take it that's not blood.

00:16:44,108 --> 00:16:46,344
No... but there's protein in it.

00:16:46,411 --> 00:16:49,347
Oh, the mile-high club.

00:16:49,414 --> 00:16:51,182
That means
the two passengers

00:16:51,249 --> 00:16:53,785
may have had no idea what was
going on inside that cabin.

00:16:53,851 --> 00:16:57,121
You know, high altitude enhances
the entire sexual experience.

00:16:57,188 --> 00:16:58,156
It increases

00:16:58,222 --> 00:17:00,057
the euphoria.

00:17:00,124 --> 00:17:01,692
Well... it's good.

00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,194
I don't know if it's that good.

00:17:04,796 --> 00:17:07,298
Cite your source.

00:17:07,365 --> 00:17:08,733
Hand me a swab, please.

00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,734
You're avoiding

00:17:09,801 --> 00:17:11,402
the question.

00:17:11,469 --> 00:17:12,770
"Enhances
sexual experience.

00:17:12,837 --> 00:17:13,871
Increases euphoria."

00:17:13,938 --> 00:17:15,239
Cite your source.

00:17:15,306 --> 00:17:17,175

00:17:17,241 --> 00:17:18,476
What magazine?

00:17:18,543 --> 00:17:22,246
<i>Applied Psychodynamics</i>
<i>in Forensic Science.</i>

00:17:22,313 --> 00:17:23,247
Never heard of it.

00:17:23,314 --> 00:17:24,348
I'll get you

00:17:24,415 --> 00:17:25,483
a subscription.

00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:26,717
Now, cite your source.

00:17:26,784 --> 00:17:28,719
Oh... now you want
to go down that route?

00:17:28,786 --> 00:17:29,587
Yeah.

00:17:29,654 --> 00:17:32,056
Nah. Never mind.

00:17:32,123 --> 00:17:33,124
You started it.

00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,598
Delta Airlines, Flight 1109,
Boston to Miami

00:17:40,665 --> 00:17:42,100
March '93, Ken Fuller.

00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:43,101
Hazel eyes

organic chem lab TABMOC...

00:17:47,004 --> 00:17:48,840
overrated... in...

00:17:48,906 --> 00:17:50,942
every aspect.

00:17:51,008 --> 00:17:53,444
Could... we...
get back to work, please?

00:17:53,511 --> 00:17:55,847
Yeah.

00:17:55,913 --> 00:17:57,548
I think your, uh...

00:17:57,615 --> 00:18:00,017
firsthand knowledge
and experience

00:18:00,084 --> 00:18:01,953
in airplane bathrooms

00:18:02,019 --> 00:18:02,987
you should do the swab.

00:18:05,456 --> 00:18:08,059
Fine.

00:18:08,126 --> 00:18:10,628
Catherine:
And where were you when this was
all going on, Mrs. Finn?

00:18:10,695 --> 00:18:12,330
Uh, Mercer, Vicky Mercer.

00:18:12,396 --> 00:18:14,298
Um, I was in the bathroom.

00:18:14,365 --> 00:18:15,466
In the bathroom?

00:18:15,533 --> 00:18:17,201
For how long?

00:18:17,268 --> 00:18:18,369
For a while.

00:18:18,436 --> 00:18:20,438
I... I really
don't fly very well.

00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:23,775
And where was your husband?
Carl:
We're not married.

00:18:23,841 --> 00:18:25,743
We just work together.

00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:27,111
Right.

00:18:27,178 --> 00:18:28,646
Where were you?

00:18:28,713 --> 00:18:30,715
I was in my seat.
So, then

00:18:30,782 --> 00:18:31,916
you saw what happened?

00:18:31,983 --> 00:18:33,718
I had my headphones on.

00:18:33,785 --> 00:18:35,553
I was listening
to the air traffic control

00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,054
channel.

00:18:37,121 --> 00:18:38,956
Puts me right out.

00:18:39,023 --> 00:18:40,892
Catherine:
So, you... slept

00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:42,393
through everything

00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:45,663
and you <i>woke</i> up next
to a... dead body.

00:18:47,865 --> 00:18:49,767
Basically, yeah.

00:19:11,589 --> 00:19:13,825
Handprints.

00:19:13,891 --> 00:19:16,828
A stallion.

00:19:16,894 --> 00:19:19,097
All right, we're going
to have to change tact here

00:19:19,163 --> 00:19:21,866
because what I said
about getting more flies
with honey--

00:19:21,933 --> 00:19:22,967
I was wrong.

00:19:23,034 --> 00:19:24,268
This is incredible.

00:19:24,335 --> 00:19:25,670
Ten people

00:19:25,737 --> 00:19:27,772
and no one's talking.

00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:29,140
My theory:

00:19:29,207 --> 00:19:31,275
the killer is in the group

00:19:31,342 --> 00:19:33,578
and the rest of them are afraid.

00:19:41,986 --> 00:19:44,255
That guy was wearing
khakis, right?

00:19:44,322 --> 00:19:46,457
Yeah.

00:19:54,365 --> 00:19:56,367
Fibers drawn from
his pants maybe?

00:19:56,434 --> 00:19:58,369
We get anything else
off the clothes?

00:19:58,436 --> 00:20:00,872
Nick's working on it.

00:20:07,545 --> 00:20:08,880
What have you got?

00:20:08,946 --> 00:20:12,683
Well... what you've got here
is a nice Bordeaux

00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,719
and a Starbuck's blend.

00:20:14,786 --> 00:20:17,155
No blood. No saliva.

00:20:18,222 --> 00:20:19,390
What about prints?

00:20:19,457 --> 00:20:21,526
Uh, well, suede leather's
a tough gig.

00:20:21,592 --> 00:20:23,027
It's too porous.

00:20:23,094 --> 00:20:24,929
Hey.

00:20:27,732 --> 00:20:30,234
Are you losing
your touch there,
Einstein?

00:20:30,301 --> 00:20:33,671
Coroner's photos
of the dead guy's back.

00:20:33,738 --> 00:20:35,606
Multiple horseshoe-shaped

00:20:35,673 --> 00:20:36,674
bruises.

00:20:36,741 --> 00:20:37,909
Those are

00:20:37,975 --> 00:20:39,077
definitely shoeprints.

00:20:39,143 --> 00:20:40,945
Yeah, looks like somebody

00:20:41,012 --> 00:20:42,413
stomped on your dead guy.

00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,414
Hmm.

00:20:43,481 --> 00:20:44,715
Bring me the jacket.

00:20:44,782 --> 00:20:46,117
If I do heel impressions

00:20:46,184 --> 00:20:48,219
I'll need something
to compare it to.

00:20:48,286 --> 00:20:49,787
See you in 20.

00:20:55,059 --> 00:20:57,595
I need their shoes.

00:20:57,662 --> 00:20:59,230
Why you telling me?

00:20:59,297 --> 00:21:02,233
Because you're the people
person, right?

00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,901
Well, why don't you
tell them that?

00:21:03,968 --> 00:21:07,205
They're not giving me <i>bupkes.</i>

00:21:07,271 --> 00:21:09,240
( <i>crunching</i> )
Please?

00:21:19,317 --> 00:21:21,219
Okay, people.

00:21:21,285 --> 00:21:22,386
Listen up.

00:21:22,453 --> 00:21:23,888
Shoes.

00:21:23,955 --> 00:21:24,989
Off.

00:21:36,567 --> 00:21:37,869
Now.

00:21:51,048 --> 00:21:53,050
( <i>crackling</i> )

00:21:58,556 --> 00:22:00,958
It all comes down to shoeprints.

00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:03,728
Hey.

00:22:03,795 --> 00:22:04,729
Catherine:
Hi.

00:22:04,796 --> 00:22:06,397
Looks like a shoe sale.

00:22:06,464 --> 00:22:09,133
Uh, Nick sent these
photo comparisons over

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,501
from the lab.
Oh.

00:22:12,904 --> 00:22:15,306
Excellent.

00:22:18,309 --> 00:22:19,310
Max.

00:22:26,684 --> 00:22:28,519
That a fit?

00:22:28,586 --> 00:22:29,921
Yeah...

00:22:40,364 --> 00:22:43,067
( <i>sighs</i> ):
Well, that's it then.

00:22:43,134 --> 00:22:45,503
( <i>drops magnifying glass</i> )

00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:48,439
Okay, folks.

00:22:48,506 --> 00:22:51,008
I've got some good news...
and I've got some bad news.

00:22:51,075 --> 00:22:52,443
The good news?

00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:54,078
Well, the good news
would be

00:22:54,145 --> 00:22:56,013
that seven of you may be...

00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,915
getting out of here very soon.

00:22:57,982 --> 00:22:59,183
What's the bad news?

00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:02,320
The bad news is that
three of you may be staying

00:23:02,386 --> 00:23:04,922
in Vegas a lot longer
than you planned.

00:23:04,989 --> 00:23:08,059
And that would be... Mr. Lou

00:23:08,126 --> 00:23:09,994
Everett

00:23:10,061 --> 00:23:12,864
Mr. Max Valdez

00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:18,603
and Dr. Kiera Behrle.

00:23:20,171 --> 00:23:21,105
Would you...

00:23:21,172 --> 00:23:23,624
please come with me.

00:23:36,939 --> 00:23:40,510
Stevie, keep
these guys on ice.

00:23:48,851 --> 00:23:49,952
I'm sorry, ma'am.

00:23:50,019 --> 00:23:52,188
This is as far as
your daughter can go

00:23:52,255 --> 00:23:54,357
but we'll have an
officer stay with her.

00:23:54,424 --> 00:23:56,125
Come on.
It's been a rough night.

00:23:56,192 --> 00:23:58,261
Dr. Behrle, we're
going to be asking you

00:23:58,328 --> 00:23:59,962
some very sensitive
questions--

00:24:00,029 --> 00:24:01,664
questions that I know
that I wouldn't want

00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:03,132
my daughter to hear.

00:24:03,199 --> 00:24:04,734
Hi.

00:24:04,801 --> 00:24:06,202
My name is Jim.

00:24:06,269 --> 00:24:07,203
What's your name?

00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:08,204
Emily.

00:24:08,271 --> 00:24:09,672
Emily. Oh, that's
a great name.

00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:11,741
Emily, I'm going
to make you

00:24:11,808 --> 00:24:12,909
a deal, okay?

00:24:12,975 --> 00:24:15,011
We're going
to borrow your mom

00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:16,179
for a little while.

00:24:16,245 --> 00:24:18,081
I'll be right back,
sweetie, okay?

00:24:18,147 --> 00:24:19,916
Okay.

00:24:19,982 --> 00:24:22,318
Okay? And here's
the good part.

00:24:22,385 --> 00:24:25,521
You get to borrow
anything you see on me.

00:24:25,588 --> 00:24:27,557
Can I borrow your gun?

00:24:27,623 --> 00:24:29,258
Well, you know,
my gun...

00:24:29,325 --> 00:24:30,426
it's kind of...

00:24:30,493 --> 00:24:32,495
it's old, and
it's heavy and...

00:24:32,562 --> 00:24:33,930
and it's stuck there.

00:24:33,997 --> 00:24:35,498
Anything else?

00:24:35,565 --> 00:24:37,433
How about your badge?

00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,435
You got a deal,
and you know what?

00:24:39,502 --> 00:24:40,903
This is the best thing.

00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:42,071
You know why?

00:24:42,138 --> 00:24:44,240
Because anyone gives
you any trouble

00:24:44,307 --> 00:24:45,575
all you got to do is...

00:24:45,641 --> 00:24:46,576
flash this.

00:24:46,642 --> 00:24:48,644
There you go.

00:24:52,348 --> 00:24:53,783
So, were you scared?

00:24:55,618 --> 00:24:57,286
Did you see what happened?

00:25:00,657 --> 00:25:02,825
Okay. Okay.

00:25:02,892 --> 00:25:05,595
It's okay.

00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:11,034
Sweet kid-- Emily.

00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:14,771
Uh, so, Dr. Behrle...

00:25:14,837 --> 00:25:16,639
how long have you been
a physician?

00:25:16,706 --> 00:25:18,408
I prefer surgeon.

00:25:18,474 --> 00:25:20,209
Mm, okay.

00:25:20,276 --> 00:25:22,512
I've been practicing
for 11 years.

00:25:22,578 --> 00:25:24,480
And what was the nature
of your visit to, uh...

00:25:24,547 --> 00:25:25,748
to Las Vegas?

00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:28,651
Emily. She wanted to see
the white tigers.

00:25:28,718 --> 00:25:31,187
How did you get that black eye?

00:25:31,254 --> 00:25:33,189
I caught it during the ruckus.

00:25:33,256 --> 00:25:36,192
The price you pay
for being a Good Samaritan.

00:25:36,259 --> 00:25:40,096
Okay.

00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:44,600
I'm, uh...
just a little confused.

00:25:44,667 --> 00:25:48,237
Your heel impressions
were found on the back

00:25:48,304 --> 00:25:51,074
of the victim's suede jacket.

00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:55,678
That's a little aggressive
for a Good Samaritan.

00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,514
Man:
No! No!

00:25:58,581 --> 00:25:59,415
Hey, stop it!

00:25:59,482 --> 00:26:00,616
Oh...

00:26:01,751 --> 00:26:02,485
Get out of the way.

00:26:02,552 --> 00:26:03,486
Get out of the way!

00:26:03,553 --> 00:26:05,788
Give him some air. Sir?

00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,758
One, two

00:26:08,825 --> 00:26:10,827
three...

00:26:14,831 --> 00:26:16,432
One, two...

00:26:16,499 --> 00:26:18,101
If he had been in my ER

00:26:18,167 --> 00:26:20,536
I might have been able
to save him

00:26:20,603 --> 00:26:24,173
but at 30,000 feet,
there's only so much you can do.

00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,309
Look...

00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:28,144
I did what I could.

00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:30,146
And you're satisfied
with that?

00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:31,347
Why?

00:26:31,414 --> 00:26:33,449
Because I'm a doctor

00:26:33,516 --> 00:26:36,452
I'm responsible
for what happened on that plane?

00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:37,687
What did happen?

00:26:37,754 --> 00:26:39,689
I protected my daughter

00:26:39,756 --> 00:26:42,492
and I tried to save
a guy's life.

00:26:42,558 --> 00:26:45,328
And yes, I'm satisfied
with that.

00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:47,530
Well, you've seen <i>Cops</i>

00:26:47,597 --> 00:26:49,732
the TV show,
so you know our game.

00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:52,535
The first one to talk
gets to make a deal.

00:26:52,602 --> 00:26:54,370
I don't need a deal.

00:26:54,437 --> 00:26:55,838
No?

00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:59,008
Well, maybe your daughter Emily
needs you to take one.

00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:05,882
Grissom:
Mm-hmm.

00:27:05,948 --> 00:27:08,551
Right.

00:27:08,618 --> 00:27:10,386
Makes sense.

00:27:10,453 --> 00:27:11,888
Okay.

00:27:11,954 --> 00:27:15,391
Thanks, Catherine.

00:27:15,458 --> 00:27:17,460
We have a ping-pong ball.

00:27:17,527 --> 00:27:20,196
We just need
to find the paddles.

00:27:23,066 --> 00:27:24,267
Where are they?

00:27:24,334 --> 00:27:26,436
Probably
in the first compartment.

00:27:27,804 --> 00:27:29,772
The doctor in 3E
told Catherine

00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:32,241
that she performed CPR
on the victim.

00:27:32,308 --> 00:27:33,910
Check the inside of the paddles.

00:27:33,976 --> 00:27:35,778
See if there's any bio gel
on them.

00:27:43,686 --> 00:27:46,089
These look like
they weren't even used.

00:27:46,155 --> 00:27:48,291
There was more lubricant
in the bathroom.

00:27:48,358 --> 00:27:50,193
It's pretty negligent
for a doctor.

00:27:50,259 --> 00:27:52,528
She's got to know
every commercial airline

00:27:52,595 --> 00:27:54,197
carries
defib paddles.

00:27:54,263 --> 00:27:56,699
Yeah, and if she didn't know,
the flight attendant sure did.

00:27:56,766 --> 00:27:59,469
By the time I thought
to grab the defibrillator

00:27:59,535 --> 00:28:00,737
he was already dead.

00:28:00,803 --> 00:28:02,705
But you are trained
to use the paddles

00:28:02,772 --> 00:28:04,173
in the event
of an emergency

00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,075
and this was an
emergency situation.

00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:07,910
Yes, but I'm trained to use them

00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:10,580
when a man is having
cardiac arrest in his seat

00:28:10,646 --> 00:28:12,448
not flopping around
in the aisle.

00:28:12,515 --> 00:28:15,218
So, whatever it was
he was going through

00:28:15,284 --> 00:28:17,353
it didn't look a heart attack.

00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,555
Look, I'm going to be honest
with you.

00:28:19,622 --> 00:28:21,557
I was scared.

00:28:21,624 --> 00:28:23,326
I mean...

00:28:23,393 --> 00:28:25,962
I thought this guy
was going to take us all down.

00:28:26,029 --> 00:28:28,031
All right, everyone
needs to return

00:28:28,097 --> 00:28:29,365
to their seats.

00:28:29,432 --> 00:28:31,200
I've got to get off!

00:28:31,267 --> 00:28:32,368
( <i>yelling</i> )

00:28:32,435 --> 00:28:33,836
I have to land this plane!

00:28:33,903 --> 00:28:36,339
All right, so let me
get this straight.

00:28:36,406 --> 00:28:37,607
2F is on the floor.

00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:39,208
His wife is in the aisle

00:28:39,275 --> 00:28:40,843
brandishing a broken
wine bottle.

00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:41,844
What about 1A?

00:28:41,911 --> 00:28:43,646
He was closest to the action.

00:28:43,713 --> 00:28:45,515
That would be Mr. Cash.

00:28:45,581 --> 00:28:47,450
Um, he was in his seat.

00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:48,618
Mr. Cash.

00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,787
I was wondering
when you guys

00:28:50,853 --> 00:28:54,757
were going to get
around to asking
me some questions.

00:28:54,824 --> 00:28:56,559
So, what did you see?

00:28:56,626 --> 00:28:58,127
Not much.

00:28:58,194 --> 00:29:00,763
Sir, it's been a long night,
and we don't have much time

00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:02,365
before our crime scene
flies away.

00:29:02,432 --> 00:29:03,700
I was in my seat.

00:29:03,766 --> 00:29:05,968
You were sitting in 1A.

00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:07,303
You were sitting ringside.

00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,838
How do you <i>not</i> see
what happened?

00:29:13,409 --> 00:29:15,144
The blind leading the blind.

00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:16,512
I'm not
totally blind.

00:29:16,579 --> 00:29:18,047
I'm legally blind.

00:29:18,114 --> 00:29:21,484
My central visual acuity
is 20/200.

00:29:23,686 --> 00:29:25,054
( <i>grunting</i> )

00:29:25,121 --> 00:29:26,389
The plane has to land!

00:29:26,456 --> 00:29:28,324
We've got to get off
this plane!

00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:30,560
Woman:
Get him off the door!

00:29:30,626 --> 00:29:33,162
No, no, no!

00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:35,198
Brown:
Can you identify
the voices?

00:29:35,264 --> 00:29:36,199
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:29:36,265 --> 00:29:37,400
First voice.

00:29:37,467 --> 00:29:38,701
4B.

00:29:38,768 --> 00:29:41,004
Businessman. I could tell
by the way he ordered drinks.

00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,271
How do you mean?

00:29:42,338 --> 00:29:44,073
JW Black, triple
not double.

00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:49,512
Second voice, guy in 2F,
kind of far away.

00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:50,513
Max.

00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,048
Third voice?

00:29:52,115 --> 00:29:55,685
Third voice, row behind me,
two seats over.

00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:57,754
Mr. Dot-com.

00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:00,990
Guy must've typed
60 words a minute.

00:30:01,057 --> 00:30:02,859
Mr. Cash, you've got to help me.

00:30:02,925 --> 00:30:05,695
I've got eight eyewitnesses
with various stories.

00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:08,431
I put them all in a mixing bowl,
add eggs, milk

00:30:08,498 --> 00:30:10,533
stick it in the oven,
and all I got

00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,602
is a limp souffle.

00:30:12,669 --> 00:30:17,040
We need you to tell us
everything you heard.

00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:22,211
From the time the deceased
banged on the cockpit door
to the time he died.

00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:24,047
Then listen up.

00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:26,115
We need to get off
this plane!

00:30:26,182 --> 00:30:27,750
I have to get off
this plane!

00:30:27,817 --> 00:30:28,985
Get him off the door.

00:30:29,052 --> 00:30:31,321
Get out of the way.
Get out of the way.

00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:34,757
No!

00:30:34,824 --> 00:30:37,760
( <i>grunting, blows landing</i> )

00:30:48,004 --> 00:30:50,973
I never heard such silence.

00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,176
( <i>beeping</i> )

00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:00,817
I got two hours till I lose
my crime scene to the feds.

00:31:00,883 --> 00:31:02,418
Tell me you have something.

00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:03,886
I know what set
this guy off.

00:31:03,953 --> 00:31:05,288
That's more than I got.

00:31:05,355 --> 00:31:07,890
We know our victim suffered
from intercranial bleeding.

00:31:07,957 --> 00:31:10,593
I had that pegged as
possible cause of death

00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:13,396
so I crack his skull open,
and what do I find?

00:31:13,463 --> 00:31:17,000
A cantaloupe
in a soup can.

00:31:17,066 --> 00:31:18,401
Tight fit.

00:31:18,468 --> 00:31:20,937
And not from one
or two blows to the head.

00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:22,905
He was also running
a high fever

00:31:22,972 --> 00:31:24,907
so I tested his spinal fluid.

00:31:24,974 --> 00:31:28,711
A normal protein level
is between 15 and 45 milligrams.

00:31:28,778 --> 00:31:30,179
Candlewell's was 60.

00:31:32,048 --> 00:31:34,183
Did anybody mention
this guy had a headache?

00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:38,788
Flight attendant gave him
two aspirin. Why?

00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:43,126
He was suffering from
undiagnosed encephalitis.

00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:44,661
Swelling of the brain.

00:31:44,727 --> 00:31:47,296
It can manifest like
a heart attack: slurred speech

00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:49,198
delirium, loss
of consciousness.

00:31:49,265 --> 00:31:50,667
You throw in
the altitude

00:31:50,733 --> 00:31:53,169
and the air pressure changes
in the cabin

00:31:53,236 --> 00:31:56,506
and our guy was probably
out of his mind.

00:31:56,572 --> 00:31:59,108
Is that what killed him--
encephalitis?

00:31:59,175 --> 00:32:01,577
It wasn't the one thing
that killed him.

00:32:01,644 --> 00:32:03,980
Ruptured spleen,
intercranial bleeding

00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,948
petecchial
hemorrhaging.

00:32:06,015 --> 00:32:09,018
And the guy's heart
just stopped beating.

00:32:09,085 --> 00:32:11,788
A, B, C, D or all of the above.

00:32:11,854 --> 00:32:13,489
Standoff with
the police--

00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:14,991
guy gets shot in the chest

00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:18,161
runs back into his burning house
inhaling smoke as he goes.

00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:19,662
The roof collapses

00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:22,465
the air conditioning unit
falls on his head, he dies.

00:32:22,532 --> 00:32:24,609
What killed him?

00:32:43,431 --> 00:32:45,366
Okay, Vicki Mercer and Carl Finn

00:32:45,433 --> 00:32:47,234
I believe
are in the bathroom.

00:32:47,301 --> 00:32:49,136
Mile-High Club.

00:32:49,203 --> 00:32:51,272
If you ask me,
it's their spouses

00:32:51,338 --> 00:32:52,673
that are the dummies.

00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:56,444
Emily Behrle is in 3F.

00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:58,512
Preston Cash, 1A.

00:32:58,579 --> 00:33:01,248
Tony Candlewell, dead guy.

00:33:01,315 --> 00:33:02,383
Right there, 3C.

00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:03,751
And for now, he's alive

00:33:03,818 --> 00:33:05,086
until he's dead.

00:33:05,152 --> 00:33:08,022
So, you want to tell us
what we're doing here?

00:33:08,089 --> 00:33:09,423
The physical evidence

00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:11,358
that Sarah, Nick,
and I collected

00:33:11,425 --> 00:33:13,027
is contradicting the
anecdotal statements

00:33:13,094 --> 00:33:14,462
that you, Catherine,
and Warrick got

00:33:14,528 --> 00:33:16,130
and my money's on
the physical evidence.

00:33:16,197 --> 00:33:17,131
So is mine.

00:33:17,198 --> 00:33:18,399
These passengers are lying.

00:33:18,466 --> 00:33:19,600
I mean, if this was

00:33:19,667 --> 00:33:22,403
an arson case, we'd
burn down an empty house

00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:24,105
to prove our
theory, right?

00:33:24,171 --> 00:33:25,272
Well, in this case

00:33:25,339 --> 00:33:27,441
we're going to
recreate the flight

00:33:27,508 --> 00:33:28,976
from... 1630 hours on.

00:33:29,043 --> 00:33:31,178
You are in 4B.

00:33:31,245 --> 00:33:32,346
Lou.

00:33:32,413 --> 00:33:33,380
Lou, the angry

00:33:33,447 --> 00:33:34,448
businessman.

00:33:34,515 --> 00:33:35,816
How about that?

00:33:35,883 --> 00:33:36,917
I want to be Shannon.

00:33:36,984 --> 00:33:38,018
Good.

00:33:38,085 --> 00:33:39,553
The stewardess.

00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:41,789
Excuse me,
it's flight attendant.

00:33:41,856 --> 00:33:43,624
Catherine-- the doctor, 3E.

00:33:43,691 --> 00:33:44,658
Single mom.

00:33:44,725 --> 00:33:46,227
What an imagination you have.

00:33:46,293 --> 00:33:48,028
Max and Marlene, 2E and F.

00:33:48,095 --> 00:33:49,430
You two are married.

00:33:49,497 --> 00:33:51,399
Who wants to wear the pants?

00:33:51,465 --> 00:33:53,768
CSI-3 seniority, sweetie.

00:33:53,834 --> 00:33:55,436
Yeah, whatever.

00:33:55,503 --> 00:33:56,637
You're henpecked anyway.

00:33:56,704 --> 00:33:57,838
Let me guess--

00:33:57,905 --> 00:33:59,740
you're the computer geek.

00:33:59,807 --> 00:34:01,342
In the interest of clarity, yes.

00:34:02,376 --> 00:34:04,345
Nate in 2C.

00:34:07,648 --> 00:34:10,418
Okay, look, it's going to
be sunrise in ten minutes.

00:34:10,484 --> 00:34:12,753
We're going to have
to do a <i>Run, Lola, Run</i>

00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:13,921
and play this
in literal time.

00:34:13,988 --> 00:34:15,423
Up until the point
that Captain Murdle

00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:17,191
escorted the dead guy
back to his seat

00:34:17,258 --> 00:34:20,428
the events are substantiated
by the flight log

00:34:20,494 --> 00:34:22,496
and the eyewitness statements

00:34:22,563 --> 00:34:25,399
unless anybody
knows something different.

00:34:25,466 --> 00:34:26,667
What time was that?

00:34:26,734 --> 00:34:27,835
1632 hours--

00:34:27,902 --> 00:34:29,670
exactly 33 minutes
before they landed

00:34:29,737 --> 00:34:31,005
in Vegas.

00:34:31,072 --> 00:34:33,541
One minute later,
the plane hit turbulence.

00:34:33,607 --> 00:34:35,076
And according to
the flight attendant

00:34:35,142 --> 00:34:36,343
that's when our stiff lost it

00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:37,945
and started hammering
his call button.

00:34:38,012 --> 00:34:40,414
So, I walk over

00:34:40,481 --> 00:34:42,516
<i>try to calm the guy down,</i>
<i>but he won't quit.</i>

00:34:42,583 --> 00:34:45,186
Grissom:
<i>Well, we know he's suffering</i>
<i>from encephalitis.</i>

00:34:45,252 --> 00:34:48,422
<i>He's probably sweating and</i>
<i>fighting back a migraine.</i>

00:34:48,489 --> 00:34:51,158
I know what my guy's doing
in my seat-- Lou.

00:34:51,225 --> 00:34:52,726
He's getting ticked off.

00:34:52,793 --> 00:34:56,731
Yeah, but Candlewell is ticking
off Nate in 2C even worse.

00:34:56,797 --> 00:34:59,166
I mean, this guy
is perseverating.

00:35:04,972 --> 00:35:06,741
That's when he winds up
and breaks your seat.

00:35:06,807 --> 00:35:07,775
So, I get up,
spin around

00:35:07,842 --> 00:35:09,643
<i>confront the guy.</i>

00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:12,279
Now, Lou in 4B said
he was the peacemaker.

00:35:12,346 --> 00:35:13,914
Brass:
Peacemaker, my ass.

00:35:13,981 --> 00:35:16,317
He's got three empties
in the pouch.

00:35:16,383 --> 00:35:18,152
<i>Seat reeks of whiskey.</i>

00:35:18,219 --> 00:35:21,055
The guy
probably spilled Lou's drink.

00:35:21,122 --> 00:35:23,057
Very good.

00:35:23,124 --> 00:35:24,825
I was boss at CSI once.

00:35:24,892 --> 00:35:25,960
For a reason.

00:35:26,026 --> 00:35:27,094
Anyway, Lou gets up.

00:35:27,161 --> 00:35:28,162
He's angry.

00:35:28,229 --> 00:35:29,597
He takes a swipe at the guy.

00:35:29,663 --> 00:35:32,266
After knocking a few back
at 33,000 feet

00:35:32,333 --> 00:35:33,534
you know,
probably misses.

00:35:33,601 --> 00:35:35,436
And what does he get
for his trouble?

00:35:37,238 --> 00:35:39,640
A CD swipe
across the chops.

00:35:39,707 --> 00:35:42,109
So, he falls back,
and maybe spilled
his own drink.

00:35:42,176 --> 00:35:43,310
This time Candlewell's

00:35:43,377 --> 00:35:45,112
got to be out of
his seat, right?

00:35:45,179 --> 00:35:47,815
Stokes:
<i>If I'm Max,</i>
<i>I want no part of this.</i>

00:35:47,882 --> 00:35:49,617
Plus I don't have
an aisle seat.

00:35:49,683 --> 00:35:51,352
Yeah, but your wife
is going to make sure

00:35:51,419 --> 00:35:52,820
that you get
in the playing field.

00:35:52,887 --> 00:35:55,289
Yeah, go ahead, honey.
Save my life.

00:35:55,356 --> 00:35:57,925
Stokes:
<i>Right. Max gets up</i>

00:35:57,992 --> 00:35:59,226
slides across Marlene.

00:35:59,293 --> 00:36:00,494
Excuse me, Buttercup.

00:36:00,561 --> 00:36:01,662
Candlewell's moving

00:36:01,729 --> 00:36:03,230
up and down the aisle by now.

00:36:03,297 --> 00:36:04,298
I come over

00:36:04,365 --> 00:36:06,634
confront the dead guy.

00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,502
Then what?

00:36:08,569 --> 00:36:09,937
Who talked to 2F?

00:36:10,004 --> 00:36:11,205
I did.

00:36:11,272 --> 00:36:13,474
Max told the dead guy
to sit down.

00:36:13,541 --> 00:36:16,043
He turned, he shoved Max
into the food cart

00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:18,312
<i>Max landed on the ground.</i>

00:36:18,379 --> 00:36:20,147
Warrick--

00:36:20,214 --> 00:36:21,816
I mean, Marlene-- that's when

00:36:21,882 --> 00:36:23,484
you got up
and grabbed

00:36:23,551 --> 00:36:24,819
the broken wine neck.

00:36:24,885 --> 00:36:26,087
Saved Nick's butt as usual.

00:36:26,153 --> 00:36:27,688
Brass:
Bottle of wine
on the floor.

00:36:27,755 --> 00:36:29,623
<i>You slash at Candlewell</i>

00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:31,792
then he swipes him
across the hand--

00:36:31,859 --> 00:36:33,294
hence the
defensive wound.

00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,395
Now, our guy's bleeding.

00:36:34,462 --> 00:36:36,097
He turns
and heads for the cockpit.

00:36:38,299 --> 00:36:39,467
Bang-- he wants in the cockpit

00:36:39,533 --> 00:36:41,235
<i>but the door is locked.</i>

00:36:41,302 --> 00:36:43,971
Captain Murdle
gets on the horn

00:36:44,038 --> 00:36:45,773
calls First Class twice.

00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,007
No answer. Why?

00:36:47,074 --> 00:36:49,543
Shannon's vapor-locked.

00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:51,045
He can't get in the cockpit.

00:36:51,112 --> 00:36:52,179
What's next?

00:36:52,246 --> 00:36:53,614
He heads for the exit door.

00:36:53,681 --> 00:36:55,349
Blood underneath
the latch handle

00:36:55,416 --> 00:36:57,418
shows that Candlewell
tried to open it.

00:36:57,485 --> 00:36:59,253
<i>Candlewell gets the door open,</i>
<i>they all die.</i>

00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,455
Now it's a whole new ball game.

00:37:01,522 --> 00:37:03,424
It's every man for himself.

00:37:03,491 --> 00:37:04,725
Oh, yeah.

00:37:04,792 --> 00:37:07,161
<i>This is where</i>
<i>they all get scared.</i>

00:37:07,228 --> 00:37:10,264
Brown:
<i>And according to Preston,</i>
<i>Max, and Lou</i>

00:37:10,331 --> 00:37:12,032
they got to Candlewell first.

00:37:12,099 --> 00:37:13,567
The struggle ensued.

00:37:13,634 --> 00:37:16,003
Max and Lou slammed
into Preston

00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:17,705
<i>and at some point</i>

00:37:17,772 --> 00:37:20,241
Candlewell goes down.

00:37:20,307 --> 00:37:21,308
Now it's a
free-for-all.

00:37:21,375 --> 00:37:22,877
'Cause my shoes
end up on his back.

00:37:22,943 --> 00:37:24,745
Mine too.
Ditto.

00:37:24,812 --> 00:37:26,680
Warrick:
He's messing with me;
I get my licks in.

00:37:26,747 --> 00:37:28,449
Grissom:
Nate's knuckles were bruised...

00:37:28,516 --> 00:37:29,984
he's in on it.

00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:31,952
We're in close quarters
so there's elbows
flying everywhere.

00:37:32,019 --> 00:37:34,755
That's probably how the
doctor got her black eye.

00:37:34,822 --> 00:37:36,123
Right.
Hey, guys!

00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:37,658
If you jump a guy
at the exit

00:37:37,725 --> 00:37:40,294
he dies at the exit.

00:37:44,732 --> 00:37:46,834
Yeah.

00:37:48,702 --> 00:37:51,372
And our guy...

00:37:51,439 --> 00:37:53,674
was found five feet away...

00:37:53,741 --> 00:37:56,911
with his head towards coach.

00:37:56,977 --> 00:37:58,479
Nick:
<i>He tried to get away.</i>

00:37:58,546 --> 00:38:00,448
Warrick:
<i>But they didn't let him.</i>

00:38:00,514 --> 00:38:02,083
Willows:
<i>And at this point</i>

00:38:02,149 --> 00:38:04,785
<i>we aren't individuals anymore;</i>
<i>we're a mob.</i>

00:38:10,658 --> 00:38:11,826
Emily:
Mommy!

00:38:18,532 --> 00:38:21,202
You can't perform CPR
on a man's back.

00:38:21,268 --> 00:38:24,071
Dr. Burley had to
have rolled him over.

00:38:24,138 --> 00:38:27,241
<i>Probably just</i>
<i>to cover for ourselves.</i>

00:38:27,308 --> 00:38:31,278
That makes us
all murderers.

00:38:43,057 --> 00:38:46,827
I want five of those passengers
arrested for murder.

00:38:46,894 --> 00:38:49,096
That's four more
than I anticipated.

00:38:49,163 --> 00:38:52,133
We looked at the evidence,
and the evidence says five.

00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:53,467
Let me get this straight.

00:38:53,534 --> 00:38:54,969
Five strangers
get on a plane

00:38:55,035 --> 00:38:56,771
and then together,
they kill a man.

00:38:56,837 --> 00:38:58,239
On the surface,
self-defense.

00:38:58,305 --> 00:39:00,941
They thought Candlewell
was bringing the plane down.

00:39:01,008 --> 00:39:03,277
And he would've.

00:39:03,344 --> 00:39:04,779
But he didn't.

00:39:04,845 --> 00:39:06,914
They stopped him,
and then they killed him

00:39:06,981 --> 00:39:08,616
not as individuals,
but as a mob.

00:39:08,682 --> 00:39:10,384
Let's cut to the chase, Gil.

00:39:10,451 --> 00:39:11,952
Can you prove your case?

00:39:12,019 --> 00:39:13,454
Not yet. I
need more time.

00:39:13,521 --> 00:39:15,022
Yeah, well, time's up.

00:39:18,092 --> 00:39:20,127
I'm going to give these people
their walking papers.

00:39:20,194 --> 00:39:22,029
If the Feds want to pursue it,
let them.

00:39:22,096 --> 00:39:23,964
Oh, come on.
Don't do that.

00:39:24,031 --> 00:39:25,566
No jury's going
to ever convict them.

00:39:25,633 --> 00:39:26,901
You don't know that, Brian.

00:39:26,967 --> 00:39:29,036
Look, if you or I
were on that plane

00:39:29,103 --> 00:39:31,572
we would do whatever it takes
to save our lives.

00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:33,274
That's what a jury would say.

00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:35,042
That's not what
the evidence says.

00:39:35,109 --> 00:39:38,112
Exactly my point.

00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:23,991
( <i>vehicle starts</i> )

00:40:27,094 --> 00:40:30,097
Woman:
<i>Las Vegas Air has issued</i>
<i>no formal comment</i>

00:40:30,164 --> 00:40:32,767
<i>other than to stand by</i>
<i>the actions taken</i>

00:40:32,833 --> 00:40:34,802
<i>by the flight crew.</i>

00:40:34,869 --> 00:40:38,239
<i>Meanwhile, the first-class</i>
<i>passengers from the flight</i>

00:40:38,305 --> 00:40:40,574
<i>have been released</i>
<i>and no charges will be filed.</i>

00:40:40,641 --> 00:40:44,178
The airline provided a bus
to their Las Vegas destinations.

00:40:44,245 --> 00:40:47,748
Our request for interviews
were denied, leaving the events

00:40:47,815 --> 00:40:50,184
surrounding the death
of Tony Candlewell a mystery.

00:40:50,251 --> 00:40:51,218
Hey.

00:40:51,285 --> 00:40:52,553
Whoa.

00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:53,888
Let it go, guys.

00:40:53,954 --> 00:40:56,424
Those people
should be going to jail

00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:58,392
not some hotel
on the Strip.

00:40:58,459 --> 00:40:59,693
It's out of our hands.

00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,195
Our field ruling was overturned

00:41:01,262 --> 00:41:02,997
by the good old Sheriff
and the Feds.

00:41:03,064 --> 00:41:04,832
Stokes:
And you're okay with that?

00:41:04,899 --> 00:41:06,834
We processed evidence
for 12 hours

00:41:06,901 --> 00:41:08,402
laid out the whole case

00:41:08,469 --> 00:41:09,470
and now
those passengers

00:41:09,537 --> 00:41:10,671
are going
to suck martinis

00:41:10,738 --> 00:41:13,040
and eat shrimp cocktails?

00:41:13,107 --> 00:41:14,942
Where's the justice?

00:41:15,009 --> 00:41:16,944
Oh, you think
this is about justice?

00:41:17,011 --> 00:41:18,212
Yeah, what else?

00:41:18,279 --> 00:41:19,613
It's about
human nature

00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,916
how people react
when their lives are threatened.

00:41:21,982 --> 00:41:24,151
I know you're not condoning
what they did.

00:41:24,218 --> 00:41:25,619
I'm not
discounting it.

00:41:25,686 --> 00:41:27,455
I mean, think about it--

00:41:27,521 --> 00:41:29,690
is there any place
more vulnerable

00:41:29,757 --> 00:41:32,293
than being at 30,000 feet
in a tin can?

00:41:32,359 --> 00:41:34,028
Feeling vulnerable

00:41:34,095 --> 00:41:35,529
is not a defense

00:41:35,596 --> 00:41:38,032
and where they were
is irrelevant.

00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:39,533
They took a life.

00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,936
Because their lives
were threatened.

00:41:42,002 --> 00:41:43,871
Their lives were threatened

00:41:43,938 --> 00:41:46,340
when Candlewell
was at the emergency exit

00:41:46,407 --> 00:41:48,309
trying to open it,
but the five feet

00:41:48,375 --> 00:41:49,977
between the exit and the aisles

00:41:50,044 --> 00:41:52,613
is what made the difference
between self-defense and murder.

00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,014
Human nature again.

00:41:54,081 --> 00:41:56,817
I mean, adrenaline doesn't come
with an off switch.

00:41:56,884 --> 00:41:58,519
I don't care
what you say.

00:41:58,586 --> 00:42:00,621
I could never take a life.

00:42:00,688 --> 00:42:05,993
If it was between him or me,
I could.

00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,495
Nick?

00:42:07,561 --> 00:42:09,196
I don't know.

00:42:09,263 --> 00:42:12,666
Well... it's wicked serious
in here.

00:42:12,733 --> 00:42:14,468
Yeah, well, we were
just talking about murder

00:42:14,535 --> 00:42:15,803
and whether we would commit it.

00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:17,805
I couldn't, Warrick could
and Nick's on the fence.

00:42:17,872 --> 00:42:19,573
We're taking an exit poll.

00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,575
Stokes:
Catherine,
you're a mother.

00:42:21,642 --> 00:42:24,345
You have Lindsey, you're on that
plane. How far do you go?

00:42:24,412 --> 00:42:26,313
All the way.

00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:28,048
That's right.
!
You didn't even hesitate.

00:42:28,115 --> 00:42:30,618
If it involves
the protection of my child

00:42:30,684 --> 00:42:32,386
I fight to the death.

00:42:32,453 --> 00:42:35,990
Warrick:
See? We have four people here,
all with different opinions.

00:42:36,056 --> 00:42:39,994
Think of how the passengers
must have felt.

00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:42,997
What do you think, Grissom?

00:42:43,064 --> 00:42:46,434
I can't answer that question.

00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,402
That's a cop-out.
It's a simple question.

00:42:48,469 --> 00:42:50,371
What would you have
done if you had been

00:42:50,438 --> 00:42:51,772
one of those passengers?

00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:53,107
It's not about that.

00:42:53,174 --> 00:42:55,042
You all have different opinions

00:42:55,109 --> 00:42:57,511
but you've taken
the same point of view.

00:42:57,578 --> 00:42:59,780
You put yourself
in the shoes of
the passengers

00:42:59,847 --> 00:43:02,850
but nobody's put themselves
in the shoes of the victim.

00:43:02,917 --> 00:43:04,418
I'm sorry. What are you saying?

00:43:04,485 --> 00:43:05,753
Nobody stopped

00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:07,354
to ask Candlewell
if he was all right.

00:43:07,421 --> 00:43:09,056
They just assumed
because he was kicking

00:43:09,123 --> 00:43:10,858
the back of Nate's seat
that he was a jerk

00:43:10,925 --> 00:43:12,793
because he was pushing
his call button

00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:14,462
that he was bothering
the flight attendant

00:43:14,528 --> 00:43:16,297
because he was trying
to get into the lavatory

00:43:16,363 --> 00:43:18,466
he was making a scene,
because he was going
back and forth

00:43:18,532 --> 00:43:21,702
up and down the aisles,
he was posing a threat.

00:43:21,769 --> 00:43:23,604
He <i>was</i> a threat.

00:43:23,671 --> 00:43:25,072
No. He turned into a threat.

00:43:25,139 --> 00:43:26,707
It didn't have to be that way.

00:43:26,774 --> 00:43:27,975
People make assumptions.

00:43:28,042 --> 00:43:29,710
That's the problem.
You just did.

00:43:29,777 --> 00:43:34,081
And I think these
passengers made
the wrong assumption

00:43:34,148 --> 00:43:37,051
and now this guy's dead.

00:43:37,118 --> 00:43:38,652
Well, if that's your stance

00:43:38,719 --> 00:43:40,554
how could it
have been prevented?

00:43:40,621 --> 00:43:42,556
If just one person

00:43:42,623 --> 00:43:45,826
had stopped and taken the time
to look at the guy

00:43:45,893 --> 00:43:49,330
to listen to him, to figure out
what was wrong with him

00:43:49,397 --> 00:43:51,198
it might not have happened.

00:43:51,265 --> 00:43:53,467
It took five people to kill him.

00:43:53,534 --> 00:43:55,477
It would've only taken
one person

00:43:55,477 --> 00:43:56,336
to save his life.
