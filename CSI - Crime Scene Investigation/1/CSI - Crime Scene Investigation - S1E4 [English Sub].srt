00:00:28,058 --> 00:00:30,969
Ah, these green worms
ain't worth a damn.

00:00:36,341 --> 00:00:37,308
( <i>thumping</i> )

00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:38,676
What the hell was that?

00:00:38,743 --> 00:00:41,079
I don't know, probably
one of those eight-foot carp.

00:00:43,381 --> 00:00:44,549
( <i>thumping</i> )

00:00:47,085 --> 00:00:48,686
Let's get out of here.

00:00:51,756 --> 00:00:53,558
( <i>engine sputters and dies</i> )

00:00:57,962 --> 00:00:59,697
Something probably
caught on the blades.

00:00:59,764 --> 00:01:00,865
Check the prop.

00:01:00,932 --> 00:01:02,200
I'm not sticking my hand

00:01:02,267 --> 00:01:03,201
in that water.

00:01:03,268 --> 00:01:04,802
Move.

00:01:04,869 --> 00:01:05,870
Move out of the way.

00:01:05,937 --> 00:01:06,871
Okay.

00:01:06,938 --> 00:01:08,339
( <i>grunting</i> )

00:01:14,179 --> 00:01:16,347
Yeah, I got something.

00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,586
Dude, throw it back.

00:01:21,653 --> 00:01:22,654
What the hell is it?

00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,098
Femur.

00:01:34,165 --> 00:01:35,967
Strongest bone
in the human body--

00:01:36,034 --> 00:01:37,936
it's sliced clean through.

00:01:38,002 --> 00:01:40,004
Like a Ginsu
through a banana.

00:01:40,071 --> 00:01:41,472
So, what do you think, drowning?

00:01:41,539 --> 00:01:44,509
Yeah, probably,
but under what circumstances?

00:01:44,576 --> 00:01:45,510
You don't wear flippers

00:01:45,577 --> 00:01:46,711
at a five-star
restaurant.

00:01:46,778 --> 00:01:47,712
Why would you wear

00:01:47,779 --> 00:01:49,414
three-inch heels at a lake?

00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:51,983
So, Watson?

00:01:53,284 --> 00:01:54,719

It sucks.

00:02:38,947 --> 00:02:39,881
Ouch.

00:02:39,948 --> 00:02:41,016
Well, time-and-a-half.

00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:42,451
A cup of java,
and you're set.

00:02:42,517 --> 00:02:44,920
Woman:
Fine suit.

00:02:44,987 --> 00:02:47,055
And well, just fine.

00:02:47,122 --> 00:02:49,024
That's harassment.

00:02:49,091 --> 00:02:50,525
Hey, we have
one locker room

00:02:50,592 --> 00:02:52,561
and it's my job
to be observant.

00:02:52,628 --> 00:02:55,163
Well, evidence vault
opens in five.

00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,598
See you guys later.

00:02:56,665 --> 00:02:57,599
Later, bro.
Easy.

00:02:57,666 --> 00:03:00,802
So, you and me,
419 Western Avenue.

00:03:00,869 --> 00:03:03,605
I know, a dead body
at a fraternity.

00:03:03,672 --> 00:03:06,875
7:00 A.M.-- Looks
like we're pulling
another double.

00:03:06,942 --> 00:03:08,310
I know, we don't
have all day...

00:03:08,377 --> 00:03:10,278
Are, are you going
to wear... that?

00:03:11,546 --> 00:03:13,949
Yeah.

00:03:14,016 --> 00:03:16,451
It's that hideous...

00:03:16,518 --> 00:03:17,486
Hideous.

00:03:17,552 --> 00:03:18,754
Thank you.

00:03:22,491 --> 00:03:24,526
( <i>clears throat</i> )

00:03:24,593 --> 00:03:27,029
Large propeller.

00:03:27,095 --> 00:03:28,897
Blade cut clean through.

00:03:28,964 --> 00:03:32,334
No epidermal bruising.

00:03:32,401 --> 00:03:33,969
The leg was severed
post-mortem.

00:03:34,036 --> 00:03:36,071
Well, that's good news.

00:03:36,138 --> 00:03:37,139
How do you figure?

00:03:37,205 --> 00:03:38,473
Well, do you want
to be alive

00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:39,941
when your leg's
being cut off?

00:03:40,008 --> 00:03:40,942
( <i>door slams</i> )

00:03:41,009 --> 00:03:43,812
I believe this goes with that.

00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:45,080
Divers recovered the body

00:03:45,147 --> 00:03:49,017
about a half a mile
east of Calville Marina.

00:03:49,084 --> 00:03:51,486
Female Caucasian,
mid-30s.

00:03:51,553 --> 00:03:53,655
Left thighbone
connected to nothing.

00:03:53,722 --> 00:03:54,990
I believe this
is our victim.

00:03:55,057 --> 00:03:57,125
Well, she's wearing
a wedding ring.

00:03:57,192 --> 00:03:58,493
Will you collect
a rape kit?

00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,428
Always do.

00:03:59,494 --> 00:04:00,862
How's it look for prints?

00:04:00,929 --> 00:04:02,564
Her skin's shriveled
like a Shar-Pei.

00:04:02,631 --> 00:04:03,699
No pressure, no prints.

00:04:06,268 --> 00:04:07,436
No.

00:04:07,502 --> 00:04:08,971
No way, use your own hand.

00:04:09,037 --> 00:04:10,172
Come on, Catherine,
my hand's too big.

00:04:10,238 --> 00:04:11,506
No!

00:04:11,573 --> 00:04:13,108
It's the only way
we can print her.

00:04:13,175 --> 00:04:14,343
Her skin on
your hand

00:04:14,409 --> 00:04:16,345
should fit like
a leather glove.

00:04:24,152 --> 00:04:26,121
Uh...

00:04:26,188 --> 00:04:27,122

On behalf
of the decedent

00:04:41,203 --> 00:04:43,705
I thank you.

00:04:48,343 --> 00:04:50,145
Umm...

00:04:50,212 --> 00:04:52,948
I think we're going
to know who she is
by lunchtime.

00:04:53,015 --> 00:04:54,149
Ugh!

00:05:01,223 --> 00:05:03,925
I can't believe I used to
live in a place like this.

00:05:03,992 --> 00:05:05,727
It seems like
a hundred years ago.

00:05:05,794 --> 00:05:07,562
And here I had
all this respect for you.

00:05:07,629 --> 00:05:09,331
Guys, Nick Stokes.

We're with the crime lab.

if you guys want
to follow me.

00:05:16,171 --> 00:05:17,172
Okay.

Hey.

Hey.

00:05:29,985 --> 00:05:31,086
Good God!

00:05:31,153 --> 00:05:32,721
You see a suicide note?

00:05:32,788 --> 00:05:34,723
We didn't find one.

00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,658
Don't release anyone
downstairs.

00:05:36,725 --> 00:05:38,160
We want to talk to them.

00:05:38,226 --> 00:05:39,194
All of them.

00:05:39,261 --> 00:05:40,195
Coroner pronounce?

00:05:40,262 --> 00:05:41,096
Twenty minutes ago.

00:05:43,165 --> 00:05:44,232
Just get him down.

( <i>camera shutter clicks</i> )

00:05:45,934 --> 00:05:50,872
She's a floater, Wendy Barger.
34, local, Green Valley.

00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:52,074
We should contact
her family.

00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,075
Already did.

00:05:53,141 --> 00:05:54,142
Talked to the husband.

00:05:54,209 --> 00:05:55,577
Never reported her
missing.

00:05:55,644 --> 00:05:58,280
The coroner said
she'd been in the
water for two days.

00:05:58,347 --> 00:05:59,681
Where's the husband now?

00:05:59,748 --> 00:06:02,517
At the coroner's,
IDing the body.

00:06:05,921 --> 00:06:07,022
Hey.

00:06:07,089 --> 00:06:08,724
Results are back
on the rape kit.

00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:11,526
Positive for semen,
vaginal penetration.

00:06:11,593 --> 00:06:13,228
You confirming rape?

00:06:13,295 --> 00:06:14,763
Well, there are
signs of a struggle.

00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,598
The victim's right
shoulder is dislocated.

00:06:16,665 --> 00:06:18,066
Her skull is fractured.

00:06:18,133 --> 00:06:19,368
( <i>inhales</i> )

00:06:19,434 --> 00:06:21,069
Give me a little more
time with the body.

00:06:21,136 --> 00:06:22,070
Sure.

00:06:22,137 --> 00:06:23,872
Thanks, Jenna.

00:06:29,244 --> 00:06:32,347
Mr. Barger, my name
is Gil Grissom.

00:06:32,414 --> 00:06:33,749
Hello.

00:06:33,815 --> 00:06:34,750
This is
Catherine Willows.

00:06:34,816 --> 00:06:36,218
We're forensic investigators.

00:06:36,284 --> 00:06:37,786
Sit down.

00:06:40,455 --> 00:06:42,391
We need to ask you
a few questions.

00:06:42,457 --> 00:06:43,392
All right.

00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:44,993
Is there anyone that you know of

00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,094
that might have wanted

00:06:46,161 --> 00:06:47,095
to harm
your wife?

00:06:47,162 --> 00:06:48,096
No.

00:06:48,163 --> 00:06:49,097
Everybody loved Wendy.

00:06:49,164 --> 00:06:50,832
When was the last time
you saw her?

00:06:50,899 --> 00:06:51,833
Tuesday morning.

00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,803
She needed some
time away...

00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,905
to get perspective.

00:06:56,972 --> 00:06:58,774
She did that
sometimes.

00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:03,445
Uh, we have a, a cabin
up by Calville Bay.

00:07:03,512 --> 00:07:05,414
And when was the last time

00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,016
you had intercourse
with your wife?

00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:09,017
Oh, that-that's personal.

00:07:09,084 --> 00:07:10,018
It's part

00:07:10,085 --> 00:07:11,186
of our investigation, sir.

00:07:11,253 --> 00:07:15,090
Uh, well, the average
is only once a week.

00:07:15,157 --> 00:07:16,158
Saturdays.

00:07:20,362 --> 00:07:22,164
Mr. Barger...

00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:23,932
Probably three
or four months ago.

00:07:23,999 --> 00:07:26,168
Would you be willing
to give us

00:07:26,234 --> 00:07:27,369
a DNA sample, sir?

00:07:28,704 --> 00:07:30,906
What's going on?

00:07:30,973 --> 00:07:32,474
I thought Wendy drowned.

00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:34,609
We're still trying
to piece it all together.

00:07:34,676 --> 00:07:35,978
A sample would be helpful.

00:07:36,044 --> 00:07:37,679
By law,
we need a warrant

00:07:37,746 --> 00:07:39,848
unless you are willing
to volunteer it.

00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,852
Was James depressed?

00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:44,853
You could say that.

00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,821
Could you say that?

00:07:45,887 --> 00:07:47,222
I mean, the kid's
18 years old

00:07:47,289 --> 00:07:48,690
he's got his whole life
life in front of him

00:07:48,757 --> 00:07:49,725
and why would he want
to hang himself?

00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:50,892
I don't know.

00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:51,893
He didn't get in?

00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,862
Get in...?

00:07:53,929 --> 00:07:54,563
The fraternity.

00:07:55,764 --> 00:07:57,199
Pledging. I mean,
it's not easy.

00:07:57,265 --> 00:07:58,333
Apparently not.

00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,701
So, you guys
let James know

00:07:59,768 --> 00:08:01,470
he wasn't getting in, right?

00:08:01,536 --> 00:08:02,638
I told him last night.

00:08:02,704 --> 00:08:03,872
I'm the one in charge
of dinging pledges.

00:08:03,939 --> 00:08:04,740
Big job?

00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,708
How'd he take it?

00:08:06,775 --> 00:08:08,477
I think you know.

00:08:16,618 --> 00:08:17,719
Hey, Judge.

00:08:17,786 --> 00:08:18,754
What's going on?

00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,222
I'm due in your court.

00:08:20,289 --> 00:08:21,590
Called for a continuance.

00:08:21,657 --> 00:08:23,325
Well, nobody told me.

00:08:23,392 --> 00:08:25,961
Nobody was supposed
to tell you.

00:08:30,165 --> 00:08:31,800
You're going
to do something for me.

00:08:31,867 --> 00:08:34,836
Judge, I thought
we were even.

00:08:34,903 --> 00:08:36,905
How much longer am
I under your thumb?

00:08:36,972 --> 00:08:40,275
You do what I ask,
slate's clean.

00:08:41,977 --> 00:08:43,045
Henderson rape case.

00:08:43,111 --> 00:08:44,046
State's evidence.

00:08:44,112 --> 00:08:46,715
Damn.

I need you to compromise
the chain of custody.

Just like that?

I have to have this case kicked.

to anybody.

You're asking

And what do you think

00:10:27,683 --> 00:10:29,518
the chances are she was
seeing somebody else?

00:10:29,584 --> 00:10:31,019
You were married.
You tell me.

00:11:52,402 --> 00:11:54,003
Nope.

00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:56,739
And as far as I can tell,
the husband's on the level.

00:11:56,806 --> 00:11:58,941
He was happier in the
marriage than she was.

00:11:59,008 --> 00:12:00,977
She had something
on the side.

00:12:01,044 --> 00:12:02,678
I can tell you firsthand

00:12:02,745 --> 00:12:05,448
when you don't cheat,
you don't suspect.

Uh, I'm in purgatory.

Meet you at the car.

00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,781
Okay, here's your frat boy.

00:12:38,848 --> 00:12:40,817
We have
a petechial hemorrhaging

00:12:40,883 --> 00:12:42,485
which is synonymous
with asphyxia.

00:12:42,552 --> 00:12:44,754
Stokes:
So he was asphyxiated
by hanging?

Are you ruling suicide?
No, not yet.

00:12:47,056 --> 00:12:48,491
When a victim is found hung

00:12:48,558 --> 00:12:50,259
we usually find
some teeth marks

00:12:50,326 --> 00:12:51,761
on the tongue.

00:12:54,097 --> 00:12:55,164
No teeth marks.

But we found him
swinging from the ceiling.

00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,002
So, the question is,
how did he get there?

00:13:01,904 --> 00:13:02,972

How did this

00:13:07,143 --> 00:13:08,945
get on his penis?
Huh.

00:13:09,011 --> 00:13:10,546
Is that a tattoo?

00:13:10,613 --> 00:13:12,982
No, no,
it looks like ink.

practice hazing?

No.

00:13:30,633 --> 00:13:32,969

no-tolerance policy

00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,042

I enforce that

00:13:39,108 --> 00:13:39,942
to the letter.

00:13:40,009 --> 00:13:41,778

of policies, too.

00:17:25,001 --> 00:17:27,103
Minimal
pulmonary
aspiration.

00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:29,739
There was no water in her lungs?

00:17:29,806 --> 00:17:32,475
If she died by drowning,
her lungs would be flooded.

00:17:35,178 --> 00:17:37,113
<i>But her lungs</i>
<i>weren't flooded.</i>

00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,815
<i>So we think</i>
<i>she was raped</i>

00:17:38,881 --> 00:17:40,583
killed, then dumped in the lake.

00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:41,984
After a very nice dinner.

00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,955
Which brings me
to her stomach.

00:17:46,022 --> 00:17:47,657
Fried calamari

00:17:47,724 --> 00:17:49,392
and based on the extent
of the digestion

00:17:49,459 --> 00:17:50,526
she died
about three hours

00:17:50,593 --> 00:17:52,829
after she ate.

00:17:59,135 --> 00:18:00,403
( <i>chattering</i> )

00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,805
Willows:
Now tell me,
why are we here?

00:18:02,872 --> 00:18:05,608
'Cause it's the only
place within ten miles

00:18:05,675 --> 00:18:08,077
of Calville Bay
that serves calamari.

00:18:08,144 --> 00:18:10,079
And you know this
because...?

00:18:10,146 --> 00:18:11,581
I come here
for calamari.

00:18:11,647 --> 00:18:13,416
Oh. Alone?

00:18:13,483 --> 00:18:17,086
No. Sometimes I
have a beer with it.

00:18:17,153 --> 00:18:19,155
Willows:
Do you recognize
this woman?

00:18:19,222 --> 00:18:21,424
She might have eaten here
Tuesday night

00:18:21,491 --> 00:18:22,759
right around this time.

00:18:22,825 --> 00:18:24,027
Ordered the calamari.

00:18:24,093 --> 00:18:25,828
Miss, everyone
orders calamari.

00:18:25,895 --> 00:18:28,197
Well, I don't care
about everyone.

00:18:28,264 --> 00:18:29,432
I care about her.

00:18:29,499 --> 00:18:31,501
Uh... yeah.

00:18:31,567 --> 00:18:32,502
Yeah, I remember her.

00:18:32,568 --> 00:18:33,936
Um, she came in
with a guy.

00:18:34,003 --> 00:18:35,671
Regulars.

00:18:35,738 --> 00:18:36,773
Good tipper.

00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:39,776
Would you happen to know
this good tipper's name?

00:18:39,842 --> 00:18:42,545
Willows:
<i>Mr. Swelco,</i>
<i>are you all right?</i>

00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:47,083
I can't believe she's dead.

00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:52,055
Could you tell us
about your affair with Wendy?

00:18:52,121 --> 00:18:54,023
Nobody knew we had one.

00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:55,858
What about
your wife?

00:18:55,925 --> 00:18:57,727
We were separated.

00:18:57,794 --> 00:19:00,963
We filed for divorce last week.

00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:03,032
I thought Wendy
was going to do

00:19:03,099 --> 00:19:04,133
the same thing.

00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,537
And... when she didn't,
you got angry?

00:19:07,603 --> 00:19:09,906
No. No.

00:19:09,972 --> 00:19:12,241
That's not
what I meant.

00:19:12,308 --> 00:19:14,477
I loved Wendy.

00:19:14,544 --> 00:19:17,380
She said the marriage
was over.

00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:20,450
It's just that... just...
she was scared.

00:19:20,516 --> 00:19:22,752
Scared?

00:19:22,819 --> 00:19:25,088
Why?

00:19:25,154 --> 00:19:26,556
She didn't want
to hurt Winston.

00:19:26,622 --> 00:19:29,992
She thought if she left, he'd...

00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:31,427
break.

00:19:31,494 --> 00:19:33,663
( <i>sniffling</i> )

00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:38,568
Tuesday night you and Wendy
had dinner at the Grille?

00:19:38,634 --> 00:19:41,070
Where'd you go after that?

00:19:41,137 --> 00:19:44,107
We went back to the marina
in her car

00:19:44,173 --> 00:19:47,009
and then we took the outboard
back here.

00:19:47,076 --> 00:19:49,645
Why'd you take the boat?

00:19:49,712 --> 00:19:53,182
Wendy didn't want anybody
to s-see her car in my driveway

00:19:53,249 --> 00:19:55,118
so we always met at the marina

00:19:55,184 --> 00:19:58,988
and then we'd take
the outboard over here.

00:19:59,055 --> 00:20:01,457
What happened once you got here?

00:20:01,524 --> 00:20:03,593
We made love.

00:20:05,661 --> 00:20:08,798
Then she left.

00:20:08,865 --> 00:20:10,266
Took the boat back.

00:20:15,004 --> 00:20:18,241
Where is... the boat?

00:20:18,307 --> 00:20:20,510
At the marina.

00:20:26,883 --> 00:20:28,151
Do you believe him?

00:20:28,217 --> 00:20:32,055
I believe he
had an affair.

00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:43,066
That the husband?

00:20:43,132 --> 00:20:45,968
Mr. Barger,
what are you doing here?

00:20:46,035 --> 00:20:49,238
You didn't call, so
I was following you.

00:20:49,305 --> 00:20:50,406
Uh, this is...

00:20:50,473 --> 00:20:51,874
Phil Swelco's house, isn't it?

00:20:51,941 --> 00:20:53,376
Do you know Mr. Swelco?

00:20:53,443 --> 00:20:54,877
Informally.

00:20:54,944 --> 00:20:56,779
Does he have something to do

00:20:56,846 --> 00:20:57,780
with Wendy's death?

00:20:57,847 --> 00:20:59,182
We're interviewing
a lot of people.

00:20:59,248 --> 00:21:00,216
Most of it's follow-up.

00:21:00,283 --> 00:21:02,618
Grissom:
Mr. Barger,
this is a time

00:21:02,685 --> 00:21:05,054
when you ought to let us
do our job.

00:21:05,121 --> 00:21:06,823
You've been through
a terrible ordeal.

00:21:06,889 --> 00:21:08,424
You've asked us
to keep you posted

00:21:08,491 --> 00:21:10,259
and I promise
we will keep you posted.

00:21:10,326 --> 00:21:11,260
I just
wanted to see

00:21:11,327 --> 00:21:12,895
if you guys have anything new.

00:21:12,962 --> 00:21:14,697
As soon as we know,
you'll know.

00:21:14,764 --> 00:21:17,333
All right.

00:21:19,535 --> 00:21:21,204
Drive safely.

00:21:22,872 --> 00:21:23,806
( <i>engine starts</i> )

00:21:23,873 --> 00:21:25,007
You know, eventually

00:21:25,074 --> 00:21:27,110
we're going to have
to tell this guy

00:21:27,176 --> 00:21:29,112
that his wife
was having an affair

00:21:29,178 --> 00:21:30,480
with somebody he knows.

00:21:30,546 --> 00:21:31,881
No, we don't,
Catherine.

00:21:31,948 --> 00:21:34,117
We have to tell him
how his wife died.

00:21:34,183 --> 00:21:36,686
Just the facts,
without all the other stuff.

00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:38,388
When Eddie was cheating on me

00:21:38,454 --> 00:21:41,157
I sure wish somebody
would have said something.

00:21:41,224 --> 00:21:42,992
You mean me.

00:21:43,059 --> 00:21:44,180
Who else?

00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,928
( <i>knocking</i> )

00:21:52,729 --> 00:21:54,798
New pet?

00:21:54,865 --> 00:21:56,066
The African red baboon
tarantula--

00:21:56,133 --> 00:21:57,334
the most feared
of all arachnids.

00:21:57,401 --> 00:21:59,469
But basically harmless.

00:21:59,536 --> 00:22:00,771
Yeah, well

00:22:00,837 --> 00:22:02,339
just keep the
lid on it, okay?

00:22:02,406 --> 00:22:03,607
I think you scared him.

00:22:03,674 --> 00:22:04,908
All his hairs
are standing up.

00:22:04,975 --> 00:22:06,443
If you're through
amusing yourself

00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:07,711
I have some news

00:22:07,778 --> 00:22:08,545
on the boat.

00:22:08,612 --> 00:22:09,713
Was it at the marina?

00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:10,814
What do you think?

00:22:10,881 --> 00:22:13,116
My spider sense says it wasn't.

00:22:13,183 --> 00:22:14,952
Right. We need to find the boat.

00:22:20,257 --> 00:22:21,491
The coroner's prelim

00:22:21,558 --> 00:22:23,093
on the frat hanging.

00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,094
Bust it out.

00:22:24,161 --> 00:22:25,095
( <i>sniffing</i> )

00:22:25,162 --> 00:22:26,430
What's that smell?

00:22:26,496 --> 00:22:28,031
I'm nuking a burrito.

00:22:28,098 --> 00:22:31,168
Mmm, junk food and
radiation-- good combo.

00:22:31,235 --> 00:22:32,903
A strip of raw calf's liver

00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:34,972
was found lodged
inside the cleft

00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:36,640
of victim's
throat.

00:22:36,707 --> 00:22:37,841
Cause of death: choking.

00:22:37,908 --> 00:22:41,545
Mm-hmm. That's interesting.

00:22:41,612 --> 00:22:43,947
Microscopic threads of fabric

00:22:44,014 --> 00:22:46,617
were found
embedded in the liver.

00:22:46,683 --> 00:22:48,252
Microscopic fabric?

00:22:48,318 --> 00:22:51,788
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

00:22:51,855 --> 00:22:53,290
You just lost me.

00:22:53,357 --> 00:22:56,860
Kyle, I'm getting
that hazing feeling.

00:22:56,927 --> 00:22:57,995
Did you stuff him?

00:22:58,061 --> 00:22:58,996
Suffocate him?

00:22:59,062 --> 00:23:00,864
Shove towels
down his throat?

00:23:00,931 --> 00:23:05,002
No. Look, lady, I have no idea
where you're going with all this

00:23:05,068 --> 00:23:06,970
but you're way off.

00:23:07,037 --> 00:23:08,906
Tell me about the liver.

00:23:11,441 --> 00:23:13,043
What about the liver?

00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:15,445
Kyle...

00:23:15,512 --> 00:23:17,014
Kyle...

00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,882
11 years ago

00:23:18,949 --> 00:23:20,117
I was you, man.

00:23:20,183 --> 00:23:23,420
Smoking cigars in closets,
playing tanks.

00:23:23,487 --> 00:23:24,588
I wore a trout

00:23:24,655 --> 00:23:27,157
in my jean pocket
for seven days

00:23:27,224 --> 00:23:29,359
till my leg
went half numb.

00:23:29,426 --> 00:23:30,561
I've been there.

00:23:30,627 --> 00:23:32,029
So, don't...

00:23:32,095 --> 00:23:34,631
don't tell me "What about it?"

00:23:35,999 --> 00:23:37,000
Okay.

00:23:37,067 --> 00:23:40,504
James begged us
for one more shot

00:23:40,571 --> 00:23:42,606
so, we came up with a challenge.

00:23:42,673 --> 00:23:46,343
<i>Swallowing raw liver.</i>

00:23:53,817 --> 00:23:55,419
Oh, man.

00:23:55,485 --> 00:23:56,920
Oh, man, he's choking.

00:23:56,987 --> 00:23:58,222
Give him the Heimlich.

00:23:58,288 --> 00:24:00,424
Give him the Heimlich.
Give him the Heimlich!

00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:02,559
( <i>gagging</i> )

00:24:02,626 --> 00:24:03,827
He's turning blue!

00:24:03,894 --> 00:24:05,395
How does a kid choke to death

00:24:05,462 --> 00:24:07,231
and end up
hanging from a rafter?

00:24:19,009 --> 00:24:21,144
Okay.

00:24:24,514 --> 00:24:25,482
We freaked.

00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:28,318
I mean,
we had a lot to lose here.

00:24:28,385 --> 00:24:29,753
We could lose
our charter

00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:31,355
or get kicked
out of school

00:24:31,421 --> 00:24:33,223
or even go to jail.

00:24:35,525 --> 00:24:38,128
So, me and Matt,
we strung him up, and...

00:24:38,195 --> 00:24:40,898
made it look
like he'd committed suicide.

00:24:44,167 --> 00:24:47,571
You do realize you just
admitted to killing him?

00:24:47,638 --> 00:24:48,772
We didn't kill him.

00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:49,973
It was an accident.

00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,074
It was an accident

00:24:51,141 --> 00:24:53,310
but now it's beginning
to look like Christmas.

00:24:56,146 --> 00:24:58,448
Look, my dad's
a top defense attorney

00:24:58,515 --> 00:25:00,918
so, if charges are filed...

00:25:00,984 --> 00:25:01,919
Don't worry.

00:25:01,985 --> 00:25:04,821
They will be.

00:25:04,888 --> 00:25:07,324
It'll be manslaughter,
not murder.

00:25:07,391 --> 00:25:10,494
And me and Matt
wind up

00:25:10,561 --> 00:25:12,663
with community service.

00:25:12,729 --> 00:25:14,064
We can hold him
for manslaughter.

00:25:14,131 --> 00:25:15,365
Manslaughter--
are you kidding?

00:25:15,432 --> 00:25:16,867
Are you willing
to settle for that?

00:25:16,934 --> 00:25:18,535
Come on, Nick, you
know as well as I do

00:25:18,602 --> 00:25:19,636
there is more to this.

00:25:19,703 --> 00:25:21,605
You're going 80 miles an hour
in second gear.

00:25:21,672 --> 00:25:23,040
Let's just slow down,
all right?

00:25:23,106 --> 00:25:24,107
Okay.

00:25:25,876 --> 00:25:28,445
They said they performed
the Heimlich, right?

00:25:28,512 --> 00:25:30,047
Yeah. I don't
believe them.

00:25:30,113 --> 00:25:32,783
Well, if they performed
the Heimlich

00:25:32,849 --> 00:25:35,118
there'd be evidence
of trauma.

00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:39,356
Yes, there would.

00:25:41,258 --> 00:25:42,292
Well, now, you're right.

00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:43,894
If they gave this frat kid
the Heimlich

00:25:43,961 --> 00:25:45,329
chances are
we'd find a broken rib.

00:25:45,395 --> 00:25:46,697
Not even a fracture.

00:25:46,763 --> 00:25:49,533
What about abdominal
or thoracic bruising?

00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,501
Nope. Photos
are all negative.

00:25:51,568 --> 00:25:52,869
They lied.

00:25:52,936 --> 00:25:55,339
When this kid was choking,
no one tried to help him.

00:25:55,405 --> 00:25:56,406
Take a look
at this.

00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:04,214
Now, we magnified
Mr. Johnson's privates.

00:26:04,281 --> 00:26:06,984
The ink is
from a felt tip.

00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:09,019
It's a Paper Max Thin Tip

00:26:09,086 --> 00:26:10,387
to be exact.

00:26:11,622 --> 00:26:12,990
"Jill W."

00:26:13,056 --> 00:26:14,324
Two triangles.

00:26:14,391 --> 00:26:16,260
No, it's two deltas.

00:26:16,326 --> 00:26:17,628
Greek letters.

00:26:17,694 --> 00:26:18,896
She's a Delt.

00:26:18,962 --> 00:26:19,963
( <i>groaning softly</i> )

00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:21,298
Freaks.

00:26:21,365 --> 00:26:24,134
Stokes:
<i>Jill, we need</i>
<i>to ask you a question.</i>

00:26:24,201 --> 00:26:26,837
Is this your signature?

00:26:28,238 --> 00:26:29,539
( <i>laughing</i> ):
Oh, my God.

00:26:31,108 --> 00:26:32,509
Oh, where did
you get that?

00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:34,244
Where do you think?

00:26:34,311 --> 00:26:35,379
You don't think

00:26:35,445 --> 00:26:37,147
that has something to do
with what happened?

00:26:37,214 --> 00:26:38,181
Stokes:
We don't know yet.

00:26:38,248 --> 00:26:40,050
That's what we're trying
to find out.

00:26:40,117 --> 00:26:41,552
How well did you know James?

00:26:41,618 --> 00:26:44,588
Uh, he was pledging
my boyfriend's house.

00:26:44,655 --> 00:26:45,889
We're Greek, I mean...

00:26:45,956 --> 00:26:48,825
We sign them,
they sign us.

00:26:48,892 --> 00:26:50,527
Of course you do.

00:26:50,594 --> 00:26:52,596
Who's your boyfriend?

00:26:52,663 --> 00:26:55,098
Kyle Travis.

00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,435
( <i>clearing throat</i> )

00:27:13,684 --> 00:27:16,286
So, looking
for fibers.

00:27:16,353 --> 00:27:17,754
Yeah, fibers

00:27:17,821 --> 00:27:20,958
liver-- anything
to implicate these guys.

00:27:47,551 --> 00:27:49,353
What the heck
is that?

00:27:49,419 --> 00:27:50,988
The murder weapon.

00:27:51,054 --> 00:27:53,991
Dingle-dangle.

00:27:58,262 --> 00:27:59,196
Let me guess.

00:27:59,263 --> 00:28:01,999
Radiohead
or Rage Against the Machine.

00:28:02,065 --> 00:28:03,967
Actually, it's
an audio book

00:28:04,034 --> 00:28:07,204
on restriction
enzyme analysis
and DNA typing.

00:28:07,271 --> 00:28:08,639
PCR fingerprinting.

00:28:08,705 --> 00:28:09,640
Choice.

00:28:09,706 --> 00:28:10,641
Right.

00:28:10,707 --> 00:28:12,542
What's Grissom
doing in the garage?

00:28:12,609 --> 00:28:14,811
Oh, he's working
that Wendy Barger case--

00:28:14,878 --> 00:28:16,013
you know,
the floater?

00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:18,382
Only clue he's got
is a missing boat

00:28:18,448 --> 00:28:19,883
which sucks,
'cause... it's missing.

00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:22,719
( <i>chuckles</i> ):
He thinks he's going to find it
in a bathtub?

00:28:22,786 --> 00:28:23,921
It's a simulation tank.

00:28:23,987 --> 00:28:26,290
He's re-creating the conditions
the night she died.

00:28:26,356 --> 00:28:29,026
Body was dumped, like,
a half mile from Calville Bay.

00:28:29,092 --> 00:28:30,160
They think the boat

00:28:30,227 --> 00:28:32,229
must have drifted
with the currents.

00:28:32,296 --> 00:28:34,164
And let me guess--
Catherine got bored.

00:28:34,231 --> 00:28:35,365
Well, you know Grissom.

00:28:35,432 --> 00:28:37,267
Shortest distance
between two points

00:28:37,334 --> 00:28:38,368
is science.

00:28:38,435 --> 00:28:41,138
And for Catherine,
it's pounding the pavement.

00:28:41,204 --> 00:28:44,408
Hey, I thought Grissom
gave you the night off.

00:28:45,976 --> 00:28:49,046
Yeah. Something came up.

00:28:49,112 --> 00:28:51,348
See you.

00:31:05,015 --> 00:31:06,617
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

00:31:06,683 --> 00:31:07,618
Yeah? Grissom.

00:31:07,684 --> 00:31:08,719
Catherine:
It's me.

00:31:08,785 --> 00:31:09,720
I found it.

00:31:09,786 --> 00:31:11,688
Just south
of Barring Point Bridge.

00:31:11,755 --> 00:31:13,657
How?

00:31:13,724 --> 00:31:15,325
I took a walk.

00:31:15,392 --> 00:31:18,028
Just south
of Barring Point Bridge?

00:31:18,095 --> 00:31:19,897
What color is the boat?

00:31:19,963 --> 00:31:22,466
It's white with lime green trim.

00:31:22,532 --> 00:31:25,535
Just like the splinters we found
in Wendy Barger's head wound.

00:31:25,602 --> 00:31:27,905
Well done, Catherine.

00:31:27,971 --> 00:31:29,039
Well done.

00:31:29,106 --> 00:31:30,274
( <i>stifled giggle</i> )

00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:32,241
Let's get the boat
back to the garage.

00:31:54,885 --> 00:31:57,354
This better be good.

00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:02,125
I need some assurances.

00:32:02,192 --> 00:32:04,194
It's a two-way street, pal.

00:32:04,261 --> 00:32:06,062
Did you do what I asked?

00:32:06,129 --> 00:32:08,231
I checked out the evidence,
yeah.

00:32:08,298 --> 00:32:10,400
But I'm not sure about the rest.

00:32:10,467 --> 00:32:11,735
What's the big deal?

00:32:11,801 --> 00:32:13,870
You break the seal
on the evidence box

00:32:13,937 --> 00:32:14,871
it's over.

00:32:14,938 --> 00:32:17,073
We put it to bed,
and I tell Henderson

00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,842
"Mission accomplished."

00:32:18,909 --> 00:32:20,911
Why don't you let me do that?

00:32:20,977 --> 00:32:22,913
( <i>siren blaring</i> )

00:32:25,882 --> 00:32:27,551
What's going on here?

00:32:27,617 --> 00:32:29,186
Judge Cohen,
you're under arrest

00:32:29,252 --> 00:32:30,587
for obstruction of justice

00:32:30,654 --> 00:32:32,389
tampering with state's evidence

00:32:32,455 --> 00:32:34,758
and violating seven articles
of scumbag.

00:32:37,794 --> 00:32:39,196
I told you...

00:32:39,262 --> 00:32:41,198
nobody owns me.

00:32:42,432 --> 00:32:44,301
Move on.

00:32:45,669 --> 00:32:48,038
Nice work, man.

00:32:48,104 --> 00:32:50,106
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:32:53,743 --> 00:32:55,045
Hey, Grissom.

00:32:55,111 --> 00:32:56,246
I hear Catherine

00:32:56,313 --> 00:32:57,247
beat you to the boat.

00:32:57,314 --> 00:32:58,582
We work as a team.

00:32:58,648 --> 00:32:59,950
We're not competing.

00:33:00,016 --> 00:33:00,951
Okay.

00:33:01,017 --> 00:33:02,752
But, uh, she found it first

00:33:02,819 --> 00:33:04,855
right?

00:33:04,921 --> 00:33:06,623
"Two roads diverged
in a yellow wood

00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:07,858
"and, sorry

00:33:07,924 --> 00:33:09,292
I could not travel both."

00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:10,660
Robert Frost.

00:33:10,727 --> 00:33:11,828
Very good, Greg.

00:33:11,895 --> 00:33:13,063
Thanks.

00:33:13,129 --> 00:33:16,900
But actually, in this case,
Mr. Frost does not apply.

00:33:16,967 --> 00:33:19,035
When you have partner

00:33:19,102 --> 00:33:20,203
you each take a road.

00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:22,138
That's how you find
a missing boat.

00:33:22,205 --> 00:33:23,640
Come on.
Level with me.

00:33:23,707 --> 00:33:26,843
Who do you think killed her--
the husband or boyfriend?

00:33:28,245 --> 00:33:29,346
And you've narrowed

00:33:29,412 --> 00:33:30,780
it down to just two suspects?

00:33:30,847 --> 00:33:31,815
Actually, you did.

00:33:31,882 --> 00:33:33,850
You see, my second week
at CSI, you told me

00:33:33,917 --> 00:33:36,353
that when a cheating spouse
is murdered

00:33:36,419 --> 00:33:39,256
there's always two suspects
at the top of the list:

00:33:39,322 --> 00:33:41,491
the lover and the betrayed.

00:33:41,558 --> 00:33:43,126
I told you this?

00:33:43,193 --> 00:33:44,528
Mm-hmm.
You see, I'm thinking

00:33:44,594 --> 00:33:47,764
that the husband
caught Wendy
with the boyfriend

00:33:47,831 --> 00:33:49,966
and when she left his house

00:33:50,033 --> 00:33:52,669
he killed her in a jealous rage.

00:33:55,138 --> 00:33:58,708
And this theory
is based on...?

00:33:58,775 --> 00:33:59,709
Nothing.

00:33:59,776 --> 00:34:01,645
I'm just trying to help.

00:34:03,747 --> 00:34:06,016
I'm going to the garage
to meet Catherine.

00:34:06,082 --> 00:34:07,450
You keep thinking, Butch.

00:34:07,517 --> 00:34:09,052
That's what you're good at.

00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:12,189
Hey. If this theory
checks out, uh

00:34:12,255 --> 00:34:14,191
maybe we should
talk about a raise.

00:34:14,257 --> 00:34:15,759
Yeah.

00:34:36,646 --> 00:34:39,816
I think I may have found
some skin.

00:34:42,185 --> 00:34:43,887
When Wendy hit her head.

00:34:45,789 --> 00:34:47,891
Did you hear what I said?

00:34:51,294 --> 00:34:52,696
Blood.

00:34:52,762 --> 00:34:55,398
Blood?

00:34:55,465 --> 00:34:56,900
You were at the autopsy.

00:34:56,967 --> 00:34:58,969
The head trauma
wasn't a bleeder.

00:34:59,035 --> 00:35:00,670
Well, maybe
she fought back.

00:35:00,737 --> 00:35:02,739
Either way,
we got to call Brass.

00:35:02,806 --> 00:35:06,276
Tell them to bring
the boyfriend in.

00:35:06,343 --> 00:35:08,979
( <i>camera shutter clicks</i> )

00:35:11,648 --> 00:35:14,251
Could you wait
right here, please?

00:35:14,317 --> 00:35:15,719
Stay with Mr. Swelco.

00:35:17,454 --> 00:35:19,222
How's it going?

00:35:19,289 --> 00:35:23,226
Aah, you know, the usual
beep-bap-bop, you know?

00:35:23,293 --> 00:35:26,129
The guy said he cut
his hand cleaning fish.

00:35:26,196 --> 00:35:27,397
Got a tetanus shot.

00:35:27,464 --> 00:35:29,699
That's his excuse for the blood
we found on the boat.

00:35:29,766 --> 00:35:31,401
But I'll call the clinic
to confirm.

00:35:31,468 --> 00:35:33,336
Damn, you're good.

00:35:33,403 --> 00:35:35,539
Oh, shut up.

00:35:35,605 --> 00:35:37,274
Stevie, hang with him.

00:35:38,975 --> 00:35:41,278
Man:
Phil?

00:35:41,344 --> 00:35:42,979
Phil Swelco?

00:35:43,046 --> 00:35:44,414
Winston.

00:35:44,481 --> 00:35:47,150
I heard about your wife.

00:35:47,217 --> 00:35:48,385
I'm sorry.

00:35:48,451 --> 00:35:49,986
What are you doing here?

00:35:50,053 --> 00:35:51,922
Why are you questioning him?

00:35:51,988 --> 00:35:53,590
Mr. Barger,
why don't, you, um

00:35:53,657 --> 00:35:55,458
come over here
with me.

00:35:55,525 --> 00:35:56,459
Just walk over...

00:35:56,526 --> 00:35:58,228
why don't we go in here
sit down.

00:35:58,295 --> 00:36:00,964
Have a seat.

00:36:03,867 --> 00:36:05,635
I always knew
she was seeing someone.

00:36:05,702 --> 00:36:07,437
I just didn't know who.

00:36:07,504 --> 00:36:10,640
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:36:10,707 --> 00:36:13,109
She was having an affair
with Phil Swelco?

00:36:13,176 --> 00:36:16,713
And you think he killed her.

00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,582
You just compromised
our investigation.

00:36:18,648 --> 00:36:20,016
He deserved to know
the truth.

00:36:20,083 --> 00:36:21,284
Knowing how
she died, yes.

00:36:21,351 --> 00:36:22,819
Knowing that she had
an affair--

00:36:22,886 --> 00:36:24,154
how does that
bring closure?

00:36:24,221 --> 00:36:26,256
I guess you
just have to be
on the wrong end

00:36:26,323 --> 00:36:27,557
of an affair
to understand.

00:36:27,624 --> 00:36:29,125
You can't make this
about Eddie.

00:36:29,192 --> 00:36:31,595
Look, you hurt our case
because your ex hurt you.

00:36:31,661 --> 00:36:33,196
We bring ourselves
to our cases.

00:36:33,263 --> 00:36:34,531
We can't help it.

00:36:34,598 --> 00:36:35,866
I knew how Barger felt.

00:36:35,932 --> 00:36:38,168
Would you relax?
I didn't give him
chapter and verse.

00:36:38,235 --> 00:36:39,903
You can't give him anything,
Catherine.

00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:41,271
We're scientists.

00:36:41,338 --> 00:36:42,539
We're not psychiatrists

00:36:42,606 --> 00:36:44,074
or victims' rights
advocates.

00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:46,643
You right, you know.
I should be just like you.

00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:48,411
Alone in my hermetically
sealed condo

00:36:48,478 --> 00:36:50,013
watching Discovery
on the big screen

00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,983
working genius-level
crossword puzzles,
but no relationships.

00:36:53,049 --> 00:36:55,252
No chance any will
slop over into a case.

00:36:55,318 --> 00:36:57,487
Right. I want to be
just like you.

00:36:58,989 --> 00:37:00,524
Technically, it's a townhouse.

00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:04,160
And the crosswords are
advanced, not genius.

00:37:04,227 --> 00:37:07,430
But you're right.
I'm deficient in a lot of ways.

00:37:07,497 --> 00:37:10,133
But I never screw up
one of my cases

00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,701
with personal stuff.

00:37:11,768 --> 00:37:14,171
Grissom...

00:37:14,237 --> 00:37:16,540
what personal stuff?

00:37:19,509 --> 00:37:21,211
Matt, I got to know.

00:37:21,278 --> 00:37:23,914
How much did it tick Kyle off?

00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:26,316
What are you
talking about?

00:37:28,718 --> 00:37:30,554
Jill.

00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:32,355
( <i>laughs</i> )

00:37:32,422 --> 00:37:35,926
Man, Kyle must've been steamed.

00:37:35,992 --> 00:37:38,929
His girlfriend signs
a pledge's privates?

00:37:38,995 --> 00:37:40,830
Yeah, Kyle, can take a joke.

00:37:40,897 --> 00:37:43,266
He didn't think it was funny
enough to share it with us.

00:37:43,333 --> 00:37:45,802
You know, I never met a guy
who could just laugh that off.

00:37:45,869 --> 00:37:47,270
Hey, Matt

00:37:47,337 --> 00:37:50,140
you know why I joined
a fraternity?

00:37:50,207 --> 00:37:52,142
'Cause I wanted
to belong

00:37:52,209 --> 00:37:54,144
to something--
the brotherhood.

00:37:54,211 --> 00:37:55,712
That's what it was
all about for me

00:37:55,779 --> 00:37:56,880
you know what I mean?

00:37:56,947 --> 00:37:58,849
So I'm going to cut to the chase
here, bud.

00:37:58,915 --> 00:38:00,851
You come clean,
you might be able

00:38:00,917 --> 00:38:02,319
to save your house

00:38:02,385 --> 00:38:04,588
save the brotherhood,
but...

00:38:04,654 --> 00:38:07,257
if you don't...

00:38:07,324 --> 00:38:09,326
You and Kyle both get charged
with murder

00:38:09,392 --> 00:38:10,660
and the house goes dark.

00:38:10,727 --> 00:38:12,596
Everything you're trying
to protect

00:38:12,662 --> 00:38:15,065
you'll destroy.

00:38:16,666 --> 00:38:17,601
Martie

00:38:17,667 --> 00:38:20,837
I found the string.

00:38:23,807 --> 00:38:26,343
Now are you ready to tell us
what happened

00:38:26,409 --> 00:38:28,612
after James got back
to that house?

00:38:32,315 --> 00:38:33,884
Okay.

00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:36,520
Hey, let's see
what Johnson
came up with.

00:38:36,586 --> 00:38:37,854
Yeah?

00:38:37,921 --> 00:38:39,256
Yeah, let's
see it, dude.

00:38:39,322 --> 00:38:40,457
Show it!

00:38:45,562 --> 00:38:46,696
Dude...

00:38:46,763 --> 00:38:48,131
that's your girlfriend.

00:38:48,198 --> 00:38:49,266
She signed it.

00:38:49,332 --> 00:38:50,433
( <i>guys hooting</i> )

00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,869
Did it hurt?

00:38:52,936 --> 00:38:54,604
Meet me upstairs, pledge.

00:38:54,671 --> 00:38:58,775
You're still behind in points.

00:38:58,842 --> 00:39:01,311
So this is
what we're going to do.

00:39:01,378 --> 00:39:03,280
I'm going to put this
down your throat

00:39:03,346 --> 00:39:04,648
You're going to swallow it

00:39:04,714 --> 00:39:07,284
and you're going to trust me
to pull it back out.

00:39:08,618 --> 00:39:09,653
Okay.

00:39:15,725 --> 00:39:18,295
( <i>gagging</i> )

00:39:23,166 --> 00:39:25,836
Dude, where's Johnson?

00:39:27,237 --> 00:39:28,405
Oh, oh, this is crazy.

00:39:28,471 --> 00:39:30,640
All right, all right,
listen to me.

00:39:30,707 --> 00:39:32,175
Anything goes down

00:39:32,242 --> 00:39:35,178
my father will bail out
the Chapter.

00:39:35,245 --> 00:39:37,280
Now you're just going
to follow my lead

00:39:37,347 --> 00:39:39,616
and you're going to keep
your mouth shut.

00:39:49,092 --> 00:39:51,995
( <i>door sliding open</i> )

00:39:52,062 --> 00:39:54,497
Is my dad here yet?

00:39:54,564 --> 00:39:57,133
No, but when he gets here
you can tell him

00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,202
new charge:
first degree murder.

00:39:59,269 --> 00:40:02,873
No way, come on.
That's ridiculous.

00:40:02,939 --> 00:40:04,708
Your boy rolled
over on, Slick.

00:40:04,774 --> 00:40:07,010
One thing about
the fraternity upstate

00:40:07,077 --> 00:40:08,678
the brotherhood's
fantastic.

00:40:08,745 --> 00:40:09,679
Oh, yeah.

00:40:09,746 --> 00:40:11,948
They gonna <i>love</i> you.

00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:18,822
( <i>hollow clanging</i> )

00:40:21,958 --> 00:40:23,927
She ran out of gas.

00:40:23,994 --> 00:40:25,595
Okay.

00:40:25,662 --> 00:40:27,063
Get in the boat.

00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:28,431
Pull the engine cord.

00:40:28,498 --> 00:40:29,900
What?

00:40:29,966 --> 00:40:31,201
Get in the boat.

00:40:31,268 --> 00:40:32,469
Why?

00:40:32,536 --> 00:40:33,870
Just indulge me, please?

00:40:33,937 --> 00:40:36,006
There's no gas.
It's not gonna start.

00:40:36,072 --> 00:40:37,274
That's not the point.

00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:39,509
( <i>sighing</i> ):
As long as
there is one.

00:40:48,018 --> 00:40:50,020
Pull it again.

00:40:51,254 --> 00:40:53,757
( <i>grunts</i> )
Go on.

00:40:53,823 --> 00:40:54,858
More.

00:40:54,925 --> 00:40:56,193
Harder.

00:40:56,259 --> 00:40:58,428
Go on.

00:41:00,564 --> 00:41:02,265
That's it. What's your point?

00:41:02,332 --> 00:41:03,400
How does your shoulder feel?

00:41:03,466 --> 00:41:04,568
It's sore.

00:41:06,736 --> 00:41:09,306
You already knew that.

00:41:09,372 --> 00:41:12,742
I know what happened to Wendy.

00:41:12,809 --> 00:41:14,778
<i>She says good night</i>
<i>to Swelco</i>

00:41:14,845 --> 00:41:16,613
<i>and gets in the boat.</i>

00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,615
<i>Halfway home,</i>
<i>the boat runs out of gas.</i>

00:41:18,682 --> 00:41:21,885
<i>Stranded in the middle</i>

<i>She pulls so hard,</i>
<i>she dislocates her shoulder</i>

00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:28,625
<i>and falls forward.</i>

00:41:28,692 --> 00:41:31,061
<i>Wendy goes under,</i>
<i>where she remains</i>

00:41:31,127 --> 00:41:33,864
<i>until Barger's propeller</i>
<i>severs her leg.</i>

00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:37,467
She died before
she ever hit the water.

00:41:39,369 --> 00:41:41,671
It was just an accident.

00:41:41,738 --> 00:41:44,674
Well, sometimes
it's about what <i>didn'thappen.</i>

00:41:44,741 --> 00:41:47,310
Well, I guess
we better go talk
to the husband.

00:41:47,377 --> 00:41:50,080
I mean, unless you think
I'm going to compromise

00:41:50,146 --> 00:41:51,915
the integrity
of the case again.

00:41:51,982 --> 00:41:53,717
Look...

00:41:53,783 --> 00:41:55,151
Could we have a truce?

00:41:55,218 --> 00:41:57,287
I would love to.

00:41:57,354 --> 00:41:59,155
Good.

00:42:03,126 --> 00:42:05,295
But let me do
all the talking

00:42:05,362 --> 00:42:07,797
to the husband
and the boyfriend.

00:42:09,866 --> 00:42:12,269
He had to say it.

00:42:12,335 --> 00:42:13,770
Hey.

00:42:16,773 --> 00:42:18,175
I'll meet you
outside, okay?

00:42:18,241 --> 00:42:19,176
Okay.

00:42:19,242 --> 00:42:20,177
Hey, Warrick.

00:42:20,243 --> 00:42:21,778
Hey, Care.

00:42:21,845 --> 00:42:23,580
Did it go okay?

00:42:23,647 --> 00:42:24,681
Yeah. Fine.

00:42:24,748 --> 00:42:26,683
Thanks for letting
Brass handle it.

00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:28,685
The fewer people
who know about this

00:42:28,752 --> 00:42:29,786
the better.

00:42:29,853 --> 00:42:32,689
I'm proud of you.

00:42:32,756 --> 00:42:35,058
No, Judge Cohen's got
a lot of soldiers.

00:42:35,125 --> 00:42:38,094
Yeah. That's
what I'm afraid of.

00:42:38,161 --> 00:42:41,798
You know, I can only
help you out so much.

00:42:41,865 --> 00:42:44,267
After that, it's up to you.

00:42:44,334 --> 00:42:47,237
Yeah, I know.

Hello?!

Mr. Swelco?!

00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:59,049
Mr. Swelco?!

( <i>man sobbing</i> )

00:43:20,871 --> 00:43:23,807
He killed my wife.

00:43:25,308 --> 00:43:28,678
We just came
from your house.

00:43:28,745 --> 00:43:30,180
We wanted to tell you

00:43:30,247 --> 00:43:33,049
that your wife's death
was an accident.

00:43:34,417 --> 00:43:36,720
What?

00:43:46,162 --> 00:43:47,931
He didn't kill her.
