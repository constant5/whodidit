00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:25,577
ANNOUNCER:
All right,
Oklahoma has a ten-point lead.

00:00:25,644 --> 00:00:27,947
Isaac got it to Hendricks.

00:00:28,013 --> 00:00:30,549
He shoots. He scores.

00:00:30,616 --> 00:00:31,617

Give me your keys
and get in the car.

00:01:21,695 --> 00:01:23,397
What is that?

00:01:28,235 --> 00:01:30,004
Is that a body?

00:01:39,246 --> 00:01:41,115
Oh, my God, she's alive.

00:01:42,249 --> 00:01:44,218
( <i>siren blares</i> )

00:01:54,562 --> 00:01:56,430
Here's what
I know so far.

00:01:56,497 --> 00:01:59,633
Victim was a well-dressed woman,
young, black.

00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,602
She's at Desert Palm Hospital

00:02:01,669 --> 00:02:03,437
multiple gunshots
to the head

00:02:03,504 --> 00:02:05,072
possible sexual assault.

00:02:05,139 --> 00:02:07,374
Doctor has her
as "death imminent."

00:02:07,441 --> 00:02:08,609
Sara, go to the hospital

00:02:08,676 --> 00:02:10,044
and process the victim.

00:02:10,111 --> 00:02:12,046
Sexual assault kit, hairs,
fibers, the works.

00:02:12,113 --> 00:02:13,547
Right now?

00:02:13,614 --> 00:02:15,750
I thought I would help you two
with the scene.

00:02:15,816 --> 00:02:18,486
The evidence won't stay
on the body long at the E.R.

00:02:18,552 --> 00:02:22,123
Walk in the park, guys.

00:02:32,133 --> 00:02:34,402
It looks like a high heel print.

00:02:34,468 --> 00:02:37,238
Maybe abducted.

00:02:37,304 --> 00:02:40,374
Did she know the guy?

00:02:40,441 --> 00:02:41,976
Did he use his car or hers?

00:02:42,042 --> 00:02:44,078
Locard's Principle:

00:02:44,145 --> 00:02:46,347
he took a piece of her
away with him

00:02:46,414 --> 00:02:48,783
and he left a piece
of himself here.

00:02:48,849 --> 00:02:50,951

( <i>box thuds</i> )

You're looking at it.


00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,329
Murder case.


00:03:40,396 --> 00:03:41,930
This mess?

You're not serious.

D.A. is.


00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:46,802
Guy named McCall shot
and killed his neighbor


00:03:46,869 --> 00:03:47,836
over a motorcycle.


00:03:47,903 --> 00:03:49,671
D.A. can't make heads or tails
of the evidence


00:03:49,738 --> 00:03:50,973
for the preliminary hearing.


00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,008
Where's McCall now?
He's being held?


00:03:53,075 --> 00:03:54,543
He ran from
the arresting officers


00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,145
so the judge refused him bail.


00:03:56,211 --> 00:03:58,514
And why isn't the case CSI
dealing with this?


00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,848
Franovich from days?


00:03:59,915 --> 00:04:00,949
He quit yesterday.


00:04:01,016 --> 00:04:03,052
Burnout.


00:04:05,421 --> 00:04:06,588
And what did the D.A. charge?


00:04:06,655 --> 00:04:07,589
Murder one.


00:04:07,656 --> 00:04:08,724
The case has
changed hands


00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:09,825
so many times


00:04:09,892 --> 00:04:11,794
that the D.A.
can't make any sense of it.


00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:12,961
It gets better.


00:04:13,028 --> 00:04:14,163
The prelim's in four days.


00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:16,965
Well, no pressure here.


00:04:17,032 --> 00:04:19,201
Great.

<i>Why would my bank</i>

be asking you about
my employment record?


00:04:28,811 --> 00:04:30,713
Well, technically,
I'm your supervisor.


00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:32,381
They said Eddie
took a second mortgage


00:04:32,448 --> 00:04:33,382
out on your house.


00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:35,684
They said that you
still own it together


00:04:35,751 --> 00:04:37,920
until the divorce
is final.


00:04:40,456 --> 00:04:42,458
We didn't want
to sell it


00:04:42,524 --> 00:04:43,892
until the market
went back up


00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:45,060
then we'd split the profits.


00:04:45,127 --> 00:04:47,129
I can't believe he took
a second out on the house.


00:04:47,196 --> 00:04:48,530
How could he
without my signature?


00:04:48,597 --> 00:04:50,366
It's Eddie.


00:04:50,432 --> 00:04:52,334
I just thought you should know.


00:04:52,401 --> 00:04:54,837
I gotta get back
out to Nick.


00:05:04,413 --> 00:05:05,381
Hey.


00:05:05,447 --> 00:05:06,448
Hey.


00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,051
You get any ID on her?


00:05:09,118 --> 00:05:10,519
No, she's a Jane Doe.


00:05:10,586 --> 00:05:12,388
She's got two bullets
lodged in her brain.


00:05:12,454 --> 00:05:14,289
Docs can't remove them
without killing her.


00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:15,557
All right.


00:05:15,624 --> 00:05:16,725
Hi.


00:05:20,329 --> 00:05:21,530
Thanks.


00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:28,737
Make a note


00:05:28,804 --> 00:05:31,140
she's married.


00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:32,541
Or recently divorced.


00:05:38,881 --> 00:05:41,817
She's warm.


00:05:41,884 --> 00:05:43,686
Feels different, huh?


00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:49,792
Uh, Evans...


00:05:51,794 --> 00:05:53,962
We're going to need
a little privacy here.


00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:16,645
I never really liked this part
of my yearly exam.

00:07:16,712 --> 00:07:18,947
These things
are always freezing.

00:07:25,454 --> 00:07:26,855
Okay.

00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:50,212
Cartridge casings.

00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:51,914
They don't look like
hunters', either.

00:07:59,254 --> 00:08:02,124
Nick, get a shot of this.

00:08:05,327 --> 00:08:08,330
Looks like a belt loop.

00:08:08,397 --> 00:08:10,065
Well, it couldn't
have been there long.

00:08:10,132 --> 00:08:11,400
No elements.

00:08:11,467 --> 00:08:13,802
GRISSOM:
Brass, was the victim
wearing denim?

00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:15,337
Silk or lace,
something like that.

00:08:15,404 --> 00:08:17,239
Definitely not denim.

00:08:17,306 --> 00:08:19,441
Good chance this is our suspect.

00:08:19,508 --> 00:08:21,410
I'm going to use scent pads.

00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:25,080
Scent pads?

00:08:25,147 --> 00:08:26,882
Canine voodoo.

00:08:26,949 --> 00:08:27,950
A dog's sense of smell

00:08:28,017 --> 00:08:30,753
is about 40 times more
acute than a human's.

00:08:30,819 --> 00:08:32,354
A dog's nose is packed

00:08:32,421 --> 00:08:35,724
with dense rolls of membranes
that absorb odor.

00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:37,826
Stretched out, these membranes
extend about a third

00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:39,361
the length
of a dog's body.

00:08:39,428 --> 00:08:40,896
The membranes
of the human nose

00:08:40,963 --> 00:08:42,765
about the size
of a postage stamp.

00:08:42,831 --> 00:08:46,268
Looks like
a giant Dustbuster.

00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,636
Similar.

00:08:47,703 --> 00:08:50,239
You place absorbent pads
into the chamber

00:08:50,305 --> 00:08:53,308
then run the machine
over the suspected item.

00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:54,309
Then you take the pad

00:08:54,376 --> 00:08:57,046
seal it in an envelope
and freeze it.

00:08:58,981 --> 00:09:00,883
Yeah. Yeah, then
we pull them out

00:09:00,949 --> 00:09:02,918
when we know enough
about this denim guy

00:09:02,985 --> 00:09:04,186
to find a proximal location.

00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:07,189
Except there's a caveat.

00:09:07,256 --> 00:09:09,458
You want to explain
that caveat?

00:09:10,659 --> 00:09:13,095
Later.

00:09:13,162 --> 00:09:16,098
Hopefully,
Sara's making some progress.

00:09:16,165 --> 00:09:20,969
Hey, are you just going
to ignore my question?

00:09:21,036 --> 00:09:23,605
I called Eddie about the loan.
I got his voicemail.

00:09:23,672 --> 00:09:25,941
The guy's like ether.

00:09:26,008 --> 00:09:28,143
You going to answer my question?

00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:30,713
All right, here's what we know
from the arresting officer:

00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,815
Two 25-year-old guys

00:09:32,881 --> 00:09:35,551
Chuckie Hastings and Roy McCall,
lifelong neighbors

00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,019
one step up
from a trailer park

00:09:37,086 --> 00:09:38,954
got into a beef
over a motorcycle

00:09:39,021 --> 00:09:40,956
in the owner's backyard.

00:09:41,023 --> 00:09:42,524
All right,
here's McCall's statement.

00:09:42,591 --> 00:09:44,626
If you can believe a guy
who's looking at murder.

00:09:44,693 --> 00:09:46,729
McCall says
that he returned

00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:50,132
Hastings' motorcycle to him
with the front end smashed up.

00:09:50,199 --> 00:09:52,234
They were standing in
Hastings' back yard...

00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:53,702
I told you
I'd pay for it.

00:09:53,769 --> 00:09:55,237
Yeah, you said that last time.

00:09:55,304 --> 00:09:56,538
Whatever.

00:09:56,605 --> 00:09:57,873
Yeah, whatever

00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,575
you bastard.

00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:01,010
Hey, back off,
man, back off.

00:10:01,076 --> 00:10:02,811
You're going to pay
for all of it.

00:10:02,878 --> 00:10:04,246
WILLOWS:
<i>McCall defends himself</i>

00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:07,349
<i>with an automatic</i>
<i>that was down his pants.</i>

00:10:12,287 --> 00:10:14,223
All right, now, Hastings' wife

00:10:14,289 --> 00:10:16,859
said that McCall
shot Hastings in the back.

00:10:16,925 --> 00:10:17,860
Mm-hmm.

00:10:17,926 --> 00:10:20,796
And the coroner's report
substantiates that.

00:10:22,564 --> 00:10:23,665
( <i>screams</i> )

00:10:23,732 --> 00:10:25,834
So what, McCall lied,
said Hastings went after him

00:10:25,901 --> 00:10:28,070
with a screwdriver
so he could plead self-defense?

00:10:28,137 --> 00:10:29,905
Well, we would need
the screwdriver

00:10:29,972 --> 00:10:32,775
with McCall's blood on it
to prove that now, wouldn't we?

00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:35,678
All right, which box?

00:10:35,744 --> 00:10:37,279
I have been through
all these boxes

00:10:37,346 --> 00:10:38,781
twice.

00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:40,115
It's not there.

00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:42,618
The evidence is lost?

00:10:42,685 --> 00:10:44,219
In a murder case?

00:10:44,286 --> 00:10:46,522
The gun is here, but
there's no screwdriver.

00:10:46,588 --> 00:10:48,457
They even have crime
scene photos of it.

00:10:48,524 --> 00:10:51,293
But no tests were run on it
before it was misplaced.

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,595
So, we know why Franovich left.

00:10:53,662 --> 00:10:55,631
He quit before
we could fire his ass.

00:10:55,698 --> 00:10:56,632
Right.

00:10:56,699 --> 00:10:58,600
So, you know who the D.A.
will blame for this?

00:10:58,667 --> 00:11:00,436
Yeah, the same people
Homicide'll blame.

00:11:00,502 --> 00:11:02,504
Well, now that
we've exhausted
all of our options

00:11:02,571 --> 00:11:04,907
let's start over.

00:11:06,308 --> 00:11:09,345
So this lady's expected to die.
Is that the story?

00:11:09,411 --> 00:11:11,780
Somebody raped her, shot her
and left her for dead.

00:11:11,847 --> 00:11:15,150
And left two cartridge
casings behind for us.

00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:16,719
Thank you very much.

00:11:22,157 --> 00:11:24,693
That kind of oversight
tells you he's stupid.

00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,362
Or true to form.

00:11:26,428 --> 00:11:28,931
People are usually meticulous
in planning up to a murder

00:11:28,997 --> 00:11:30,899
they rarely plan the aftermath.

00:11:30,966 --> 00:11:32,801
Still, you'd think the bad guys
would figure

00:11:32,868 --> 00:11:35,771
we'd eventually start a data
base on cartridge casings, huh?

00:11:35,838 --> 00:11:37,272
( <i>computer buzzes</i> )

00:11:38,941 --> 00:11:41,510
Gentlemen, we've got
ourselves a bull's-eye.

00:11:43,379 --> 00:11:44,913
STOKES:
Well, well, well.

00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,749
Looks like this gun
was used before in a case

00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:48,650
we've handled.

00:11:48,717 --> 00:11:51,086
North Vegas.

00:11:51,153 --> 00:11:53,789
And I gotta do a side-by-side
comparison to be sure.

00:11:53,856 --> 00:11:55,924
Well, listen, if you get
a confirmation, page me.

00:11:55,991 --> 00:11:57,259
I gotta go see Sara.

00:11:57,326 --> 00:11:58,560
Okay.

00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:09,405
( <i>clink</i> )

00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:23,152
Saint Catherine.

00:12:23,218 --> 00:12:25,587
She studied science.

00:12:28,857 --> 00:12:30,392
She was tough

00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:34,029
and very outspoken.

00:12:34,096 --> 00:12:37,866
Went against
the Emperor himself.

00:12:37,933 --> 00:12:40,135
Chewed him out
for persecuting Christians.

00:12:40,202 --> 00:12:43,205
Took him two
or three tries

00:12:43,272 --> 00:12:47,710
to execute her.

00:12:47,776 --> 00:12:50,446
She never gave up.
She was brave.

00:12:59,755 --> 00:13:01,357
You hold on to this.

00:13:14,636 --> 00:13:18,407
This shouldn't have
happened to you.

00:13:18,474 --> 00:13:21,110
But, I promise

00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:25,214
I will find out
who did this.

00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,882
I promise.

00:13:32,021 --> 00:13:33,355
Hey.

00:13:33,422 --> 00:13:34,523
Hey.

00:13:38,594 --> 00:13:41,597
Sexual assault kit's
ready to process.

00:13:41,663 --> 00:13:43,432
How's it look?

00:13:43,499 --> 00:13:46,568
We'll see.

00:13:46,635 --> 00:13:49,872
She's, um...

00:13:49,938 --> 00:13:51,073
breathing.

00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,409
She's evidence.

00:13:55,611 --> 00:13:56,712
Sara?

00:13:56,779 --> 00:13:58,747
Yeah?

00:13:58,814 --> 00:14:02,484
If you try and chase two rabbits
you end up losing them both.

00:14:16,142 --> 00:14:19,145
( <i>barking</i> )

00:14:30,184 --> 00:14:32,486
( <i>knocking</i> )

00:14:33,603 --> 00:14:34,604
Hi.

00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:36,305
Lauriane Hastings?

00:14:36,372 --> 00:14:39,041
We're with the Las
Vegas Crime Lab.

00:14:39,108 --> 00:14:40,042
Cops.

00:14:40,109 --> 00:14:41,844
I have talked
to enough of you already.

00:14:41,911 --> 00:14:43,179
BROWN:
Ma'am, we're
not cops.

00:14:43,246 --> 00:14:44,680
We're crime scene
investigators.

00:14:44,747 --> 00:14:46,482
We've come to ask you
a few questions

00:14:46,549 --> 00:14:48,451
about the day that
your husband was killed.

00:14:48,518 --> 00:14:51,354
Maybe acquaint ourselves
with the actual crime scene.

00:14:51,421 --> 00:14:53,055
Is this going to let
Roy McCall out of jail

00:14:53,122 --> 00:14:54,624
which is where
he belongs?

00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:57,460
We're simply reviewing
the evidence for the
preliminary hearing.

00:15:02,131 --> 00:15:04,200
McCall was always borrowing
this motorcycle

00:15:04,267 --> 00:15:05,535
and Chuckie was mad at him

00:15:05,601 --> 00:15:07,370
'cause he returned it
wrecked again.

00:15:07,437 --> 00:15:08,504
He was yelling at him

00:15:08,571 --> 00:15:10,773
and out of the blue
McCall pulled his gun.

00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,041
You were home.

00:15:12,108 --> 00:15:13,676
Yes, I was.

00:15:13,743 --> 00:15:14,877
And you saw the shooting?

00:15:14,944 --> 00:15:16,345
I most
certainly did.

00:15:16,412 --> 00:15:18,247
I was doing laundry here...

00:15:18,314 --> 00:15:19,615
McCALL:
Get your hands off me.

00:15:19,682 --> 00:15:20,616
CHUCKIE:
I'm sick of you, man.

00:15:20,683 --> 00:15:22,018
McCALL:
Whatever.

00:15:22,085 --> 00:15:25,088
LAURIANE:
<i>I went to see and try</i>
<i>to break it up.</i>

00:15:25,154 --> 00:15:27,557
CHUCKIE:
Back off, man.
Back off.

00:15:27,623 --> 00:15:28,958
Get your sorry ass
off my property.

00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,727
( <i>gunshots</i> )

00:15:36,165 --> 00:15:37,600
( <i>screaming</i> )

00:15:39,268 --> 00:15:40,803
Out back here?

00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,071
Yes.

00:15:50,613 --> 00:15:53,349
How long did you say
they had been arguing

00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:55,518
before you heard
the first shot?

00:15:55,585 --> 00:15:58,454
Couple minutes.

00:15:58,521 --> 00:16:00,623
And then you
went out back?

00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:02,525
That's right.

00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:06,329
Okay, thank you.

00:16:06,396 --> 00:16:08,798
This won't take
very long.

00:16:08,865 --> 00:16:09,932
( <i>timer beeps</i> )

00:16:12,702 --> 00:16:14,137
What's up?

00:16:14,203 --> 00:16:16,606
She did a "fill-in" back there
in the garage.

00:16:16,672 --> 00:16:19,041
First, she said she saw both
shots, but I just asked her

00:16:19,108 --> 00:16:20,777
and she said she heard
the first shot

00:16:20,843 --> 00:16:22,445
and then came
running out here.

00:16:22,512 --> 00:16:23,579
Heard the first shot

00:16:23,646 --> 00:16:24,981
and then came
running out here.

00:16:25,047 --> 00:16:26,082
Yeah.

00:16:26,149 --> 00:16:27,950
McCall had
a semiautomatic.

00:16:28,017 --> 00:16:30,420
I mean, you could
pull off a shot in
two-tenths of a second.

00:16:30,486 --> 00:16:31,821
Right.

00:16:31,888 --> 00:16:33,956
It took me 3.8 seconds
to get out here.

00:16:34,023 --> 00:16:35,425
She didn't see any shot.

00:16:35,491 --> 00:16:38,027
So she just filled in
what she thought happened--

00:16:38,094 --> 00:16:39,996
that McCall shot
her husband
in cold blood.

00:16:40,063 --> 00:16:41,297
Right.

00:16:41,364 --> 00:16:42,298
Typical eyewitness.

00:16:42,365 --> 00:16:43,399
So, there's a good chance

00:16:43,466 --> 00:16:44,834
that McCall
was telling the truth

00:16:44,901 --> 00:16:47,270
that he shot Hastings
in self-defense.

00:16:47,336 --> 00:16:49,806
Well, if we had
the screwdriver
that someone lost

00:16:49,872 --> 00:16:51,140
we'd be able to
check for blood.

00:16:51,207 --> 00:16:52,141
Right.

00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:53,876
Let's go see McCall.

00:16:53,943 --> 00:16:55,378
No one lost him.

00:16:55,445 --> 00:16:56,879
All right.

00:17:00,116 --> 00:17:02,118
Hey, you guys,
this North Vegas shooting

00:17:02,185 --> 00:17:03,786
with the same casings
as our Jane Doe's?

00:17:03,853 --> 00:17:04,787
Mm-hmm.

00:17:04,854 --> 00:17:06,355
It was gang-related.

00:17:06,422 --> 00:17:08,257
And Homicide never found
the shooter.

00:17:08,324 --> 00:17:10,993
It's almost impossible
in gang neighborhoods.

00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:11,994
Nobody wants to talk.

00:17:12,061 --> 00:17:14,931
People are afraid.

00:17:14,997 --> 00:17:16,566
Listen, let's see if
we have any evidence

00:17:16,632 --> 00:17:18,101
that's not attributed
to the victim.

00:17:19,235 --> 00:17:21,170
( <i>paper bag rustling</i> )

00:17:21,237 --> 00:17:22,238
Here you go.

00:17:28,778 --> 00:17:30,079
GRISSOM:
Snakebacks.

00:17:30,146 --> 00:17:35,752
Gang shooters mark their kills
by tossing down their hats.

00:17:40,323 --> 00:17:43,593
Some sort of anthropological
quirk of territoriality.

00:17:43,659 --> 00:17:46,362
Like cats spraying
on a bush.

00:17:46,429 --> 00:17:48,531
Lets the opposition know
who was responsible.

00:17:48,598 --> 00:17:50,867
Somebody wore this hat a lot.

00:17:55,605 --> 00:17:57,507
This sweatband might give us DNA

00:17:57,573 --> 00:18:00,276
and I could compare it
to the samples I collected

00:18:00,343 --> 00:18:01,978
off of Jane at the hospital.

00:18:03,413 --> 00:18:04,414
Jane?

00:18:06,249 --> 00:18:08,184
Our... Jane Doe.

00:18:08,251 --> 00:18:09,519
My "death imminent."

00:18:09,585 --> 00:18:11,220
First-name basis, Sara?

00:18:12,522 --> 00:18:15,158
I'll be in DNA.

00:18:25,568 --> 00:18:26,869
Hey.

00:18:26,936 --> 00:18:29,138
This is, uh, Detective Sam Vega
from the Gang Detail.

00:18:29,205 --> 00:18:31,207
He's here to give us
information on 23rd Street.

00:18:31,274 --> 00:18:33,709
This is Gil Grissom
and Nick Stokes
from the Crime Lab.

00:18:33,776 --> 00:18:34,977
We're looking for a shooter.

00:18:35,044 --> 00:18:36,279
Guy abducted, raped and shot

00:18:36,345 --> 00:18:37,980
a young black woman
the other night.

00:18:38,047 --> 00:18:39,682
We get a couple
of shootings a week here

00:18:39,749 --> 00:18:41,751
from the Snakebacks,
out of a four-block radius

00:18:41,818 --> 00:18:42,819
from this point here.

00:18:42,885 --> 00:18:44,454
Usually at the
Pepper Street Gang.

00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,155
Your guy might have left
the neighborhood

00:18:46,222 --> 00:18:47,356
as part of a gang initiation.

00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:49,158
It means more
when the victim's a civilian.

00:18:49,225 --> 00:18:50,827
STOKES:
Our ball cap belongs

00:18:50,893 --> 00:18:52,428
to somebody
in this neighborhood.

00:18:52,495 --> 00:18:55,698
These houses are full of people
who know the guy who wears it.

00:18:55,765 --> 00:18:58,267
Okay, Nick, ready to
burn some shoe leather?

00:18:58,334 --> 00:19:00,670
Some old-fashioned police work,
what do you say, huh?

00:19:00,737 --> 00:19:02,472
Why can't we just use
those scent pads?

00:19:02,538 --> 00:19:03,940
The dogs?

00:19:04,006 --> 00:19:05,775
Constitutional issue.

00:19:05,842 --> 00:19:07,777
We can't get a warrant
for the evidence we find

00:19:07,844 --> 00:19:08,778
off the dogs' search.

00:19:08,845 --> 00:19:11,380
Great, great.

00:19:11,447 --> 00:19:12,949
Why'd you even suggest it?

00:19:13,015 --> 00:19:14,117
You're a grown man, Nick.

00:19:14,183 --> 00:19:15,585
Stop whining.

00:19:21,224 --> 00:19:23,192
BROWN:
Mr. McCall, according
to your statement

00:19:23,259 --> 00:19:25,328
you went over to your
neighbor Hastings' house

00:19:25,394 --> 00:19:26,462
to return his motorcycle.

00:19:26,529 --> 00:19:28,331
You got into a dispute
over a wrecked fender

00:19:28,398 --> 00:19:30,166
and he attacked you
with a screwdriver.

00:19:30,233 --> 00:19:32,235
He stabbed me
in the arm.

00:19:32,301 --> 00:19:33,703
Hey, back off, man.

00:19:35,204 --> 00:19:36,639
( <i>groans</i> )

00:19:36,706 --> 00:19:38,841
Can you circle the area
in which the screwdriver

00:19:38,908 --> 00:19:40,943
entered your arm when
Hastings attacked you?

00:19:47,216 --> 00:19:48,885
May I exam your
client's wound?

00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:52,054
Yes, anything
to clear my client.

00:20:00,897 --> 00:20:01,898
Thanks.

00:20:05,168 --> 00:20:07,737
I think he's telling
the truth.

00:20:07,804 --> 00:20:08,938
He's right-handed.

00:20:09,005 --> 00:20:11,207
I could tell when
he took the pen.

00:20:11,274 --> 00:20:13,910
So you're saying that if he'd
inflicted the wound on himself

00:20:13,976 --> 00:20:15,511
he would have stabbed
his left arm.

00:20:15,578 --> 00:20:17,113
And even if he'd
tried to fool us

00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,314
and stabbed
his right arm

00:20:18,381 --> 00:20:21,084
the entry scar would
have been upward,
not down.

00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:24,153
Mr. McCall, which direction
was Hastings facing

00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,354
when you shot him?

00:20:25,421 --> 00:20:26,689
He was facing my client.

00:20:26,756 --> 00:20:27,790
End of story.

00:20:27,857 --> 00:20:29,358
Well, the coroner disagrees.

00:20:29,425 --> 00:20:31,294
Well, that's
the coroner's problem.

00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,528
And I after I tell any jury

00:20:32,595 --> 00:20:34,731
how your side managed to lose
a piece of evidence

00:20:34,797 --> 00:20:37,366
as important as
the screwdriver

00:20:37,433 --> 00:20:38,468
really, how much weight

00:20:38,534 --> 00:20:40,136
will the Coroner's
findings have?

00:20:42,171 --> 00:20:44,040
People don't realize
just how many sets of hands

00:20:44,107 --> 00:20:45,641
a piece of evidence
passes through.

00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:47,810
Losing evidence isn't
about anything sneaky.

00:20:47,877 --> 00:20:48,811
It's just human error.

00:20:48,878 --> 00:20:51,280
Yeah, defense attorneys
have made a whole career

00:20:51,347 --> 00:20:52,281
off that human error.

00:20:52,348 --> 00:20:53,282
Yeah, tell me about it.

00:20:53,349 --> 00:20:55,485
( <i>phone rings</i> )

00:20:55,551 --> 00:20:56,986
Hello.

00:20:57,053 --> 00:20:58,020
Eddie...

00:20:58,087 --> 00:21:00,056
I-I'll meet you
at the coroner's.

00:21:00,123 --> 00:21:01,824
So, you took a second
out on the house

00:21:01,891 --> 00:21:05,128
and, uh, didn't tell me
about it?

00:21:05,194 --> 00:21:06,662
No, I would have remembered

00:21:06,729 --> 00:21:08,765
you telling me something
as big as...

00:21:08,831 --> 00:21:10,233
Oh, a studio.

00:21:10,299 --> 00:21:11,567
Are you out of your mind?

00:21:11,634 --> 00:21:13,536
So, now I'm going
to be making house payments

00:21:13,603 --> 00:21:15,772
which you never had money for
when we lived together

00:21:15,838 --> 00:21:17,106
<i>and</i> a second mortgage?

00:21:17,173 --> 00:21:18,808
No, we don't have time
to talk about this.

00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:22,078
You get that loaned
canceled, and you
do it now, Ed.

00:21:22,145 --> 00:21:23,413
Now!

00:21:23,479 --> 00:21:25,548
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:21:27,183 --> 00:21:29,385
Doc, are you sure
McCall shot Hastings
in the back?

00:21:29,452 --> 00:21:31,320
Back to front,
both times.

00:21:31,387 --> 00:21:32,722
This guy McCall swears

00:21:32,789 --> 00:21:34,991
that he shot him straight
ahead in self-defense.

00:21:35,057 --> 00:21:36,592
Look at my notes.

00:21:40,029 --> 00:21:41,531
Right here.

00:21:43,733 --> 00:21:44,834
"Entry wounds

00:21:44,901 --> 00:21:48,037
"piercing the back,
both small, regular

00:21:48,104 --> 00:21:50,339
"with evidence of
carbonaceous material

00:21:50,406 --> 00:21:52,275
typical of having just
emerged from a gun..."

00:21:52,341 --> 00:21:53,276
Right.

00:21:53,342 --> 00:21:54,710
"...and they exited
out the front

00:21:54,777 --> 00:21:56,612
"with a classic keyhole
effect-- irregular.

00:21:56,679 --> 00:21:59,615
"First bullet

00:21:59,682 --> 00:22:00,716
"lattissimus dorsi

00:22:00,783 --> 00:22:02,919
"passed through
the lower intestine

00:22:02,985 --> 00:22:05,388
"exited out

00:22:07,356 --> 00:22:08,491
"The second bullet

00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:11,727
"passed through Hastings'
C-7 thoracic nerve

00:22:11,794 --> 00:22:14,897

the pectoralis major."

00:22:16,199 --> 00:22:18,468
All right, look, I'm not
doubting your findings.

00:22:18,534 --> 00:22:19,469
But when guys go at it

00:22:19,535 --> 00:22:21,270
they're not like
gingerbread men, you know?

00:22:21,337 --> 00:22:23,906
They're, like, bobbing
and weaving.

00:22:23,973 --> 00:22:25,675
It's like W.W.F. Smackdown.

00:22:25,742 --> 00:22:27,477
You know?

00:22:27,543 --> 00:22:29,345
All of these things
could have changed

00:22:29,412 --> 00:22:31,748
what went down when
Hastings and McCall tangled.

00:22:31,814 --> 00:22:33,816
Anatomically speaking,
it's open-and-shut.

00:22:33,883 --> 00:22:35,985
You guys are the ones
to put perspective on it.

00:22:36,052 --> 00:22:36,986
No doubt.

00:22:37,053 --> 00:22:37,987
When Catherine gets here

00:22:38,054 --> 00:22:39,655
can you tell her
I went over to Evidence

00:22:39,722 --> 00:22:41,090
to check out
the victim's T-shirt?

00:22:41,157 --> 00:22:42,625
Mm-hmm.

00:22:43,626 --> 00:22:48,398
( <i>humming softly</i> )

00:22:55,338 --> 00:22:57,640
( <i>continues humming</i> )

00:22:57,707 --> 00:22:59,776
( <i>singing softly</i> )

00:23:04,647 --> 00:23:07,316
Hey.

00:23:07,383 --> 00:23:09,619
Any luck on 23rd Street?

00:23:09,685 --> 00:23:11,888
I, uh, broke in
my new shoes.

00:23:11,954 --> 00:23:13,189
That's about it.

00:23:13,256 --> 00:23:14,590
What'd the lab say?

00:23:14,657 --> 00:23:16,959
The DNA from the ball cap
is a match to the semen

00:23:17,026 --> 00:23:18,494
we found on our Jane Doe.

00:23:18,561 --> 00:23:22,198
But... CODIS hasn't
kicked out a name.

00:23:22,265 --> 00:23:26,269
So, you're just...
looking at Missing
Persons reports?

00:23:26,335 --> 00:23:28,971
We're not having any luck
finding the shooter

00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:30,973
from his DNA with a belt loop

00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,543
so I thought I would
at least try

00:23:33,609 --> 00:23:36,679
and identify the poor woman
before she dies.

00:23:43,686 --> 00:23:46,055
Sara.

00:23:46,122 --> 00:23:48,257
Do you have
any diversions?

00:23:48,324 --> 00:23:49,625
Do I what?

00:23:49,692 --> 00:23:53,062
You max out on overtime
every month.

00:23:53,129 --> 00:23:55,064
You go home and listen
to your police scanner.

00:23:55,131 --> 00:23:57,133
You read forensic
textbooks...

00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,534
Yeah.

00:24:02,271 --> 00:24:07,477
Look, every day we meet people
on the worst day of their lives.

00:24:07,543 --> 00:24:09,412
It's a lot to deal with.

00:24:09,479 --> 00:24:11,347
Everyone who's had any time
on this job

00:24:11,414 --> 00:24:13,316
knows that you have
to have a diversion

00:24:13,382 --> 00:24:16,619
in order to cope
with what we see.

00:24:16,686 --> 00:24:19,689
What do you do for fun?

00:24:19,756 --> 00:24:21,524
I chase rabbits.

00:24:24,727 --> 00:24:25,661
And...

00:24:25,728 --> 00:24:28,064
I read crime books.

00:24:28,131 --> 00:24:30,900
And I listen
to the scanner.

00:24:30,967 --> 00:24:33,336
You need something outside
of law enforcement.

00:24:33,403 --> 00:24:36,239
Catherine has
her kid, you know?

00:24:36,305 --> 00:24:39,709
I sometimes...

00:24:39,776 --> 00:24:41,644
ride roller coasters.

00:24:42,678 --> 00:24:46,182
What do you do?

00:24:46,249 --> 00:24:47,583
Nothing.

00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:49,819
Okay.

00:24:49,886 --> 00:24:51,087
What do you like?

00:24:51,154 --> 00:24:52,889
I don't like anything.

00:24:55,091 --> 00:24:56,692
You've got to find
something to like.

00:24:56,759 --> 00:24:58,461
You can't get too close
to the victims.

00:24:58,528 --> 00:25:02,765
She's special... to me.

00:25:02,832 --> 00:25:04,967
I can't help it.

00:25:05,034 --> 00:25:06,169
If you don't find something

00:25:06,235 --> 00:25:08,871
they'll all become special
and you'll burn out.

00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,018
Sara.

00:25:22,085 --> 00:25:23,419
Okay.

00:25:23,486 --> 00:25:24,754
I'm almost done.

00:25:24,821 --> 00:25:26,189
I just got to log off.

00:25:48,826 --> 00:25:50,327
So, this is progress.

00:25:50,394 --> 00:25:53,330
The shirt confirms
what the coroner said:

00:25:53,397 --> 00:25:55,899
the shots were fired
back to front.

00:25:55,966 --> 00:25:57,935
Look at those entry holes.

00:26:00,103 --> 00:26:01,805
Yeah, but look
at that gunpowder.

00:26:04,641 --> 00:26:05,909
Unburned gunpowder.

00:26:05,976 --> 00:26:07,211
Which happens when
a gun is fired

00:26:07,277 --> 00:26:08,645
less than three feet
from a victim.

00:26:08,712 --> 00:26:10,314
Right.

00:26:11,915 --> 00:26:14,017
McCall says that
they were standing

00:26:14,084 --> 00:26:16,353
five paces apart.

00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,255
Mrs. Hastings says

00:26:18,322 --> 00:26:19,790
the exact same thing.

00:26:19,857 --> 00:26:23,093
So, we got two eyewitnesses
on opposite sides of the case...

00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,328
saying the same thing.

00:26:24,394 --> 00:26:26,396
In direct contradiction
to our evidence.

00:26:26,463 --> 00:26:27,831
Well, the DA's
on my beeper.

00:26:27,898 --> 00:26:31,068
Would you, uh, explain this
to him because I can't.

00:26:31,135 --> 00:26:32,402
Yeah, right.

00:26:32,469 --> 00:26:33,670
Hey...

00:26:33,737 --> 00:26:37,674
when's the last time
you took target practice?

00:26:37,741 --> 00:26:40,811
Figures. I just
had a manicure.

00:26:40,878 --> 00:26:43,013
Okay, so we're doing
this reconstruction

00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,382
and the best way is to
measure the distance

00:26:45,449 --> 00:26:47,384
between the victim
and the assailant

00:26:47,451 --> 00:26:49,720
during the time of the
altercation, right?

00:26:49,787 --> 00:26:51,054
Right.

00:26:51,121 --> 00:26:52,222
( <i>snaps chamber shut</i> )

00:26:52,289 --> 00:26:53,891
Using the same firearm and ammo

00:26:53,957 --> 00:26:57,060
that McCall used in his backyard
on Hastings.

00:26:57,127 --> 00:26:59,129
Right.

00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:42,439
BROWN:
Circumference of the gunpowder
is the same.

00:27:42,506 --> 00:27:43,774
Looks like

00:27:43,841 --> 00:27:45,809
two feet for shot number one...

00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,648
...and one foot for shot

00:27:51,715 --> 00:27:53,684
number two.

00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,486
And according
to Lauriane Hastings' statement

00:27:55,552 --> 00:27:56,487
he was running away.

00:27:56,553 --> 00:27:57,521
How can the second shot

00:27:57,588 --> 00:27:58,722
be closer
than the first?

00:27:58,789 --> 00:28:00,023
It can't.
It's not possible.

00:28:02,593 --> 00:28:04,695
We just disproved
their statement.

00:28:04,761 --> 00:28:06,897
And then we've got
McCall's statement.

00:28:08,899 --> 00:28:11,101
Can't happen
when someone's facing you.

00:28:11,168 --> 00:28:13,670
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:28:13,737 --> 00:28:16,073
The truth is somewhere
in the middle.

00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,442
How long do we have
till the prelim?

00:28:18,509 --> 00:28:20,711
I think I know how
we can figure this out.

00:28:20,778 --> 00:28:22,946
I saw this thing
in my forensics catalog.

00:28:23,013 --> 00:28:24,948
What kind of "thing"?

00:28:25,015 --> 00:28:26,617
STOKES:
<i>Now you</i> want <i>to use</i>

00:28:26,683 --> 00:28:28,685
the dogs to track down
the Jane Doe shooter?

00:28:28,752 --> 00:28:30,187
K-9 unit's going
to meet us there.

00:28:30,254 --> 00:28:31,522
Yeah, but I spoke to Brass.

00:28:31,588 --> 00:28:33,690
He said we can't get a warrant
on anything we need

00:28:33,757 --> 00:28:35,692
from the suspect's house--
gun, jeans, nothing.

00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:37,361
That's if we find him
inside his house.

00:28:37,427 --> 00:28:39,696
In which case,
we'll figure
out another way

00:28:39,763 --> 00:28:40,864
to get a warrant.

00:28:40,931 --> 00:28:42,366
You're rushing this
for Sarah.

00:28:42,432 --> 00:28:43,867
My priority is
the case, Nick.

00:28:43,934 --> 00:28:46,303
Release the hounds.

00:29:13,897 --> 00:29:16,400
You were shopping.

00:29:18,068 --> 00:29:20,337

00:29:20,404 --> 00:29:22,806

Are we supposed

to be able to keep
up with those guys?

00:29:53,237 --> 00:29:55,906
Yeah!

want with me anyway?

00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,518
Hey, you two,
don't be hassling me.

00:30:42,653 --> 00:30:44,188
( <i>footsteps approaching</i> )

00:30:44,254 --> 00:30:47,357
Guy's wearing the evidence
in plain sight.

00:30:47,424 --> 00:30:49,026
We just got lucky.

00:30:49,092 --> 00:30:50,360
WOMAN:
Tony!

00:30:50,427 --> 00:30:52,196
What are you doing?!

00:30:52,262 --> 00:30:53,897
You got a problem?

00:30:53,964 --> 00:30:55,499
Ma'am, is-is this your son?

00:30:55,566 --> 00:30:56,934
Yes.
Well, we're
going to have

00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,335
to talk to him for a minute.

00:30:58,402 --> 00:31:01,004
You police-- coming here
with your attack dogs.

00:31:01,071 --> 00:31:03,440
Actually, they're scent dogs,
and I'm not a police officer.

00:31:03,507 --> 00:31:04,641
I'm a forensics scientist

00:31:04,708 --> 00:31:06,176
with the Las Vegas
Police Department.

00:31:06,243 --> 00:31:07,511
What do I got to say

00:31:07,578 --> 00:31:08,512
to a scientist?

00:31:08,579 --> 00:31:09,713
You could say "hello."

00:31:11,915 --> 00:31:16,120
This dummy cost
over $500?

00:31:16,186 --> 00:31:17,387
Oh, yeah.

00:31:17,454 --> 00:31:18,555
He's worth it.

00:31:18,622 --> 00:31:19,690
Why?

00:31:19,756 --> 00:31:21,125
Well, look at him.

00:31:21,191 --> 00:31:26,063
He's lifelike, he doesn't talk,
and he's self-healing.

00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:27,197
He's "self-healing"?

00:31:27,264 --> 00:31:28,432
Yeah.

00:31:28,499 --> 00:31:31,135
We make a mistake
in our calculations

00:31:31,201 --> 00:31:32,569
we just start over.

00:31:32,636 --> 00:31:34,559
Cool.

00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,428
Um, the wound track is off.

00:31:36,495 --> 00:31:38,630
Do it two centimeters higher.

00:31:39,965 --> 00:31:43,268
All right.

00:31:43,335 --> 00:31:44,436
How's that?

00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:46,238
Good.
All right.

00:31:46,304 --> 00:31:51,710
Now, the second shot
was fired like so.

00:31:51,777 --> 00:31:53,478
And the coroner says
that Hastings was shot

00:31:53,545 --> 00:31:54,913
just like this,
from back to front

00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:57,349
and Hastings' wife
says the same thing--

00:31:57,416 --> 00:31:59,418
that her husband
was running away.

00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:03,989
And McCall says that
Hastings was facing him

00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:05,891
shot him in self-defense

00:32:05,957 --> 00:32:09,161
and he's got the wound...

00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:10,429
to prove it.

00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:12,764
Just like I said before,
guys don't go at it

00:32:12,831 --> 00:32:15,000
and fight like
gingerbread men,
you know?

00:32:15,067 --> 00:32:16,568
Mm-hmm.

00:32:16,635 --> 00:32:17,969
Check it out.

00:32:19,237 --> 00:32:21,473
What if, um...

00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:24,142
he was lunged...

00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:28,213
...just kind of like this?

00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:33,318
Oh, you are wrong!

Warrick

00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:43,862
I think maybe they were both
telling the truth.

00:32:43,929 --> 00:32:45,497
Yeah.

00:32:45,564 --> 00:32:48,233
I'm calling the DA.

00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:58,210
So, Tony, where were
you two nights ago?

00:32:58,276 --> 00:32:59,644
I was nowhere special.

00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:00,812
I was just hanging.

00:33:00,879 --> 00:33:02,180
Grissom told you

00:33:02,247 --> 00:33:03,715
to keep me out,
didn't he?

00:33:03,782 --> 00:33:05,050
Yeah.

00:33:05,117 --> 00:33:06,718
Were you wearing those pants

00:33:06,785 --> 00:33:07,886
the other night?

00:33:07,953 --> 00:33:08,887
Oh, these jeans?

00:33:08,954 --> 00:33:10,489
What's it to you?

00:33:10,555 --> 00:33:12,090
They're missing a belt loop.

00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:15,193
I find that interesting.

00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,695
BRASS:
You mind if we
look at those?

00:33:16,762 --> 00:33:18,497
We got some scrubs
for you to wear.

00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:21,166
He doesn't have to
do anything unless
a judge says to.

00:33:21,233 --> 00:33:24,302
That's why we're asking Tony
to volunteer.

00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:25,837
GRISSOM:
With your
permission...

00:33:25,904 --> 00:33:27,539
Chill, Moms.

00:33:27,606 --> 00:33:29,341
I got nothing to hide.

00:33:29,408 --> 00:33:30,809
It's no big thing.

00:33:30,876 --> 00:33:33,378
Cop said lady isn't even dead.

00:33:33,445 --> 00:33:36,715
That's true, she isn't...

00:33:36,782 --> 00:33:40,318
but if she dies within a year
and a day of the shooting...

00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:41,987
then it's murder.

00:33:42,053 --> 00:33:43,722
SHAUNDA:
Is this some
kind of trick?

00:33:43,789 --> 00:33:45,891
No, ma'am,
it's the law.

00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:47,592
We're working this case
as a murder.

00:33:47,659 --> 00:33:49,761
At least
for the next year and a day

00:33:49,828 --> 00:33:51,863
and even then,
I'm still a juvie.

00:33:53,932 --> 00:33:56,535
Well, then I guess the law
is on your side, Tony, isn't it?

00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:57,936
For now.

Hi, Catherine.

00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:06,645
Somebody wanted
to see you.

00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:07,646
Hey, baby.

00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:08,980
Hi, Mommy.

00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,916
Daddy's taking me
to dinner tonight.

00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:13,418
He is?

00:34:13,485 --> 00:34:14,753
Main room at the Orpheus.

00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:17,122
They have lions and tigers
at the restaurant

00:34:17,189 --> 00:34:19,257
and Daddy said
I can go to a show after.

00:34:19,324 --> 00:34:21,193

Well, uh...

00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:23,195
you know, honey,
it's a school night

00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:25,664
so I need to discuss
that with Daddy first.

00:34:25,731 --> 00:34:28,533
Come on, Mom.
It's just this one night.

00:34:32,738 --> 00:34:34,005
Ed...

00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,508
Hey, Lindsey, I got some games
on my computer.

00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:37,743
You want to see?

00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:39,244
Sure.
Come on, let's
go play one.

Uh, I'll see you
in a bit, honey.

00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:44,683
You set me up.

00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,518
How, by taking our daughter
to dinner?

00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:48,353
Get over here.

00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,021
Oh, come on now!

00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,356
What?!

00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:53,358
You are so pathetic.
What?! <i>What?!</i>

00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:54,526
Just so pathetic.

00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:55,994
Watch it, Cath.

00:34:56,061 --> 00:34:59,164
Sucking up to our daughter
'cause I caught you robbing me.

00:34:59,231 --> 00:35:01,266
The only thing I
ever robbed you of
was good sex.

00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:03,935
( <i>scoffing</i> ):
<i>No</i> sex is worth you,
and you are not taking

Oh, <i>they're</i> whores?

When I met you

00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:11,410
you were taking
your clothes off
in a strip club.

00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:13,378
It was a job, Ed

00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:15,614
and it supported you,
just like every job I've had

00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,115
including this one!

to close up your nose?

I'll let go of you
when I'm damn good and...

out of here.

you have

Wait a minute.

00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:08,290
Hastings was <i>facing</i> McCall,
and McCall shot him in the <i>back?</i>

You can't have it
both ways, guys.

00:37:10,192 --> 00:37:12,161
A judge will laugh me
out of court.

00:37:12,227 --> 00:37:14,763
Well... bear with us.

00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:17,099
All right. I'm McCall.

00:37:17,166 --> 00:37:18,300
I have a gun.

00:37:18,367 --> 00:37:19,334
I'm Hastings.

00:37:19,401 --> 00:37:21,470
I stab McCall
in the right arm.

00:37:23,105 --> 00:37:25,040
WARRICK:
I push him back off.

00:37:25,107 --> 00:37:26,341
And Hastings charges again.

00:37:26,408 --> 00:37:28,544
This time he <i>lunges</i>
at his midsection.

00:37:29,878 --> 00:37:31,647
I shoot.

00:37:33,015 --> 00:37:35,684
CATHERINE:
He shoots from two feet

00:37:35,751 --> 00:37:37,686
according to our firearms
range test

00:37:37,753 --> 00:37:40,055
and the unburned powder
on the victim's clothes.

00:37:40,122 --> 00:37:42,124
And the bullet enters
through the back

00:37:42,191 --> 00:37:43,992
even though we are
facing each other

00:37:44,059 --> 00:37:45,394
and exits...

00:37:45,461 --> 00:37:46,728
out the front.

00:37:46,795 --> 00:37:48,464
The first shot is fired
in self-defense.

00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:50,365
But then McCall
shoots Hastings

00:37:50,432 --> 00:37:52,134
a second time.
Now that shot...

00:37:52,201 --> 00:37:53,302
Boom.

00:37:53,368 --> 00:37:55,237
...was not
in self-defense.

Chalk it up to adrenaline
or revenge

00:38:05,214 --> 00:38:06,815
but Hastings was already
going down.

00:38:06,882 --> 00:38:08,851
There was no reason
to shoot him a second time.

00:38:08,917 --> 00:38:10,853
I've got to say, I'm impressed.

00:38:10,919 --> 00:38:12,554
You two just put on
quite a show.

00:38:12,621 --> 00:38:14,923

at trial?

00:38:16,592 --> 00:38:18,260
That's our job.

00:38:18,327 --> 00:38:20,095
We'll see you in court, Sam.

I appreciate it. I...

00:38:34,576 --> 00:38:36,778
You've got to get
that divorce finalized, huh?

00:38:56,498 --> 00:38:59,368
We caught him.

00:38:59,434 --> 00:39:01,236
If you hadn't pulled
that belt loop

00:39:01,303 --> 00:39:03,505
we might never
have found him, but...

00:39:03,572 --> 00:39:06,241
You did good.

00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:10,646

I'm Tom, uh,
Pam's husband.

all you've done.

00:39:21,323 --> 00:39:23,659
Sure.

00:39:23,725 --> 00:39:25,928
Oh, I wanted to give you this.

00:39:25,994 --> 00:39:28,964
I've been keeping it...
for Jane--

00:39:29,031 --> 00:39:33,469
Pam, uh, until I found
her family.

00:39:33,535 --> 00:39:35,604
Thanks.

00:39:39,541 --> 00:39:41,109
How are you doing?

00:39:41,176 --> 00:39:42,744
Okay, uh...

00:39:42,811 --> 00:39:44,146
Good.

00:39:44,213 --> 00:39:48,851
The doctor says
Pammie's condition
is stabilized.

00:39:48,917 --> 00:39:51,286
He was in an hour ago.

00:39:51,353 --> 00:39:52,921
He expects her to live.

00:39:52,988 --> 00:39:54,823
Says she's not
going to die.

00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:57,092
That's great.

00:39:57,159 --> 00:39:58,093
That's-that's great.

00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,062
She's a real fighter, huh?

00:40:00,129 --> 00:40:02,064
THOMAS:
Well, we're moving her

00:40:02,131 --> 00:40:04,133
to Haven View Center
later this week.

00:40:04,199 --> 00:40:06,735
Do-do you know that facility?

00:40:06,802 --> 00:40:10,939
Yeah, I do, know people
who've gone there.

00:40:12,708 --> 00:40:14,610
They'll take real good care
of her.

00:40:14,676 --> 00:40:19,081
That's what the doctor said.

00:40:19,148 --> 00:40:21,183
I got to go.

00:40:25,087 --> 00:40:27,022
Well, um, uh...

00:40:27,089 --> 00:40:29,491
come see us sometime.

00:40:29,558 --> 00:40:32,427
Definitely.

00:40:32,494 --> 00:40:34,363
Haven View, I'll be there.

00:40:36,865 --> 00:40:38,867
Good luck.

00:40:38,934 --> 00:40:40,569
Good luck to you.

00:41:12,267 --> 00:41:17,272
The husband
doesn't get it.

00:41:17,339 --> 00:41:21,243
He's so happy
she's going to live

00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:23,645
he doesn't realize

00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:27,115
she's going to be
in a vegetative state

00:41:27,182 --> 00:41:29,618
for the rest of her life.

00:41:32,588 --> 00:41:36,244
And that kid Thorpe

00:41:39,394 --> 00:41:42,397
is going to be out
of juvie in 48 months.

00:41:44,666 --> 00:41:46,768
It's not fair.

00:41:50,706 --> 00:41:52,975
It's the system.

00:41:53,041 --> 00:41:55,544
What kind of system
rewards the suspect

00:41:55,611 --> 00:41:58,814
when the victim
is too tough to die?

00:42:08,357 --> 00:42:10,993
Sara...

00:42:11,059 --> 00:42:14,663
you've got to learn
to let this go

00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:17,533
or you're going to spend
all your time in hospitals

00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:20,135
trying to help
the people you couldn't save.

00:42:22,304 --> 00:42:24,907
I wish I was like you, Grissom.

00:42:24,973 --> 00:42:28,811
I wish I didn't feel anything.

00:42:41,657 --> 00:42:43,592
( <i>sighing</i> ):
Oh.
