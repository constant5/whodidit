00:00:28,104 --> 00:00:29,826
Woman:
What's taking
you so long?


00:00:29,893 --> 00:00:31,795
I just wanted you
to fix the leak.


00:00:31,861 --> 00:00:33,663
Look, lady,
to fix the leak

00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:37,267
I need to find the leak.

00:00:43,273 --> 00:00:44,541
( <i>material ripping</i> )

00:00:44,607 --> 00:00:46,042
Hold on.

00:00:46,109 --> 00:00:47,710
You find the leak?

00:00:47,777 --> 00:00:50,580
( <i>grunts</i> )

00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:53,803
Plumber:
I found something.

00:01:05,448 --> 00:01:07,617
Okay, I'm ready up here.

00:01:07,683 --> 00:01:09,118
Hang on a minute.

00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:15,691
Okay, I'm there.

00:01:15,758 --> 00:01:18,527
Stokes ( <i>over radio</i> ):
Can you confirm it's human?

00:01:18,594 --> 00:01:21,731
Medicarpal, phalanges...

00:01:21,797 --> 00:01:24,433
No question about it.

00:01:26,802 --> 00:01:29,071
Hold on, Nick.

00:01:30,473 --> 00:01:32,441
There's got to be
an easier way.

00:01:32,508 --> 00:01:34,910
When a body decomposes
in concrete

00:01:34,977 --> 00:01:37,813
it leaves an air pocket,
vacuum-sealed.

00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,550
If we do this right, it'll open
like a jar of pickles.

00:01:57,166 --> 00:02:00,336
Ten bucks says the owner
sells the house.

00:02:00,403 --> 00:02:03,539
Grissom:
By law, you've got
to disclose everything--

00:02:03,606 --> 00:02:06,375
three bedrooms,
two baths, and a skeleton.

Nick's going to work with me

00:02:43,528 --> 00:02:45,129
on that unidentified body
at Summercliff.

00:02:45,196 --> 00:02:48,099
I hear it's just bones?
What a rush.

00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:49,534
O.I.S. at the Jockey Club.

00:02:49,601 --> 00:02:50,768
Officer-involved shooting.

00:02:50,835 --> 00:02:52,070
I'll take a piece of that.

00:02:52,136 --> 00:02:53,538
Good, I want you to double up.

00:02:53,605 --> 00:02:55,206
Listen, these deals
are never easy

00:02:55,273 --> 00:02:56,908
so keep me informed,
please.

00:02:56,975 --> 00:02:58,343
Will do.
I drive.

00:02:58,409 --> 00:02:59,811
Picture that.

00:02:59,878 --> 00:03:02,480
So what do you
have for me?

00:03:02,547 --> 00:03:03,915
I could use a rush.

00:03:03,982 --> 00:03:05,850
Well, this qualifies, 4-26.

00:03:05,917 --> 00:03:07,952
But I can't give you
the case.

00:03:08,019 --> 00:03:09,687
Because?

00:03:09,754 --> 00:03:11,089
Conflict of interest.

00:03:11,155 --> 00:03:14,792
The alleged rape victim's
an exotic dancer.

00:03:18,162 --> 00:03:21,499
Because I used to be one,
I'll be biased?

00:03:21,566 --> 00:03:22,734
No.

00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,569
The suspect's your ex-husband.

00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,979
He's asking for you,
but you can't take it.

00:03:37,982 --> 00:03:40,552
Just let me do the prelim.

00:03:43,655 --> 00:03:44,789
All right.

00:03:44,856 --> 00:03:46,457
Do what you can.

00:03:46,524 --> 00:03:50,028
But after the preliminary,
you pass it off, okay?

00:04:14,886 --> 00:04:17,989
Thank God you're here.

00:04:18,056 --> 00:04:19,357
Eddie.

00:04:19,424 --> 00:04:21,860
I didn't rape
that girl.

00:04:21,926 --> 00:04:23,628
According
to the police report

00:04:23,695 --> 00:04:25,563
she's telling
a different story.

00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:28,566
I wonder what the rape kit's
going to say.

00:04:28,633 --> 00:04:29,901
We had sex, okay?

00:04:29,968 --> 00:04:33,271
But <i>she</i> was there
with me 100%.

00:04:35,473 --> 00:04:38,243
In the parking lot
behind the club.

00:04:38,309 --> 00:04:40,912
Well, some women like
the outdoors.

00:04:44,115 --> 00:04:45,216
Melanie know about this?

00:04:45,283 --> 00:04:48,052
Mel and I split up a while ago.

00:04:48,119 --> 00:04:49,787
You might want to call her
anyway.

00:04:49,854 --> 00:04:52,023
She can loan you the money
for an attorney.

00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:53,491
You're not going
to help me?

00:04:53,558 --> 00:04:54,893
Cath, I am in a jam here!

00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:56,728
A detective from Sex Crime's
been assigned.

00:04:56,794 --> 00:04:58,096
I'm going to place another CSI.

00:04:58,162 --> 00:04:59,130
What about Lindsey?

00:05:00,798 --> 00:05:01,966
What about her?

00:05:02,033 --> 00:05:03,067
You want her

00:05:03,134 --> 00:05:05,637
spending Sunday afternoons
with me

00:05:05,703 --> 00:05:08,439
at Nevada State Prison,
or the mall?

00:05:11,209 --> 00:05:13,278
Based on the auricular surface

00:05:13,344 --> 00:05:16,047
I'd say she died
when she was about 20.

00:05:16,114 --> 00:05:18,516
She?

00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:20,885
It's in the hips.

00:05:20,952 --> 00:05:23,321
The pelvic bone is
definitely female.

00:05:23,388 --> 00:05:24,622
You know, for a ladies' man

00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:26,391
you don't know much
about bone structure.

00:05:26,457 --> 00:05:28,660
I know all I need to know.

00:05:28,726 --> 00:05:30,295
I figure
she was killed

00:05:30,361 --> 00:05:33,231
before her cement bath.

00:05:33,298 --> 00:05:34,766
Yeah, how?

00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:36,100
She was stabbed

00:05:36,167 --> 00:05:38,469
at least a dozen times

00:05:38,536 --> 00:05:40,672
a screwdriver maybe

00:05:40,738 --> 00:05:42,307
or a spike.

00:05:42,373 --> 00:05:45,343
No, the gouges on her ribs
are unusual.

00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:48,746
The instrument had to be...
slightly curved

00:05:48,813 --> 00:05:52,650
with some kind
of serrated edge.

00:05:54,352 --> 00:05:57,889
Like crocodile teeth.

00:05:57,956 --> 00:05:59,257
Whatever killed this girl

00:05:59,324 --> 00:06:01,125
it was not a traditional weapon.

00:06:03,595 --> 00:06:04,863
Well, stabbings are personal.

00:06:04,929 --> 00:06:06,397
She knew her attacker.

00:06:06,464 --> 00:06:08,066
That's the rule.

00:06:15,306 --> 00:06:17,308
Who are you?

00:06:21,212 --> 00:06:22,881
Sara Sidle, Warrick Brown

00:06:22,947 --> 00:06:23,882
Officer Joe Tyner.

00:06:23,948 --> 00:06:25,016
Hi.

00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:26,050
Hi.

00:06:26,117 --> 00:06:27,218
Officer Tyner.

00:06:27,285 --> 00:06:28,853
How are you doing?

00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,455
Tell us what happened
here tonight.

00:06:30,522 --> 00:06:31,890
He responded
to shots fired

00:06:31,956 --> 00:06:33,658
the suspect fled the scene.

00:06:33,725 --> 00:06:36,528
Why don't you tell us
what happened here.

00:06:37,962 --> 00:06:41,366
( <i>tires squealing</i> )

00:06:41,432 --> 00:06:43,401
Unit Five. I'm in pursuit
of the fleeing 413

00:06:43,468 --> 00:06:45,003
heading southbound on the Strip.

00:06:46,738 --> 00:06:48,406
( <i>tires squealing</i> )

00:06:50,575 --> 00:06:52,510
Get back
into the car!

00:06:52,577 --> 00:06:54,612
Drop your keys
to the ground!

00:06:54,679 --> 00:06:55,680
Put your hands
on the wheel!

00:06:55,747 --> 00:06:57,215
I didn't do it!

00:06:57,282 --> 00:06:58,483
Whatever
you think I did!

00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,051
I'm looking at three strikes.

00:07:00,118 --> 00:07:01,920
I'm not going back.

00:07:01,986 --> 00:07:03,021
I'll show you my registration.

00:07:03,087 --> 00:07:04,489
No, put your hands
on the wheel!

00:07:04,556 --> 00:07:05,056
( <i>fires gun</i> )

00:07:05,123 --> 00:07:06,057
Then he turned

00:07:06,124 --> 00:07:07,358
the weapon on himself

00:07:07,425 --> 00:07:09,894
and one shot,
right through the forehead.

00:07:09,961 --> 00:07:11,062
Where's his gun?

00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:12,964
I left it in the jeep.

00:07:13,031 --> 00:07:14,365
I'm going to go bag it.

00:07:14,432 --> 00:07:16,301
Officer, we're going to need
your weapon as well.

00:07:16,367 --> 00:07:18,369
I never fired.

00:07:18,436 --> 00:07:19,537
Drawn but not fired.

00:07:19,604 --> 00:07:21,372
It's just standard procedure.

00:07:23,508 --> 00:07:25,677
It's okay. It's all right.

00:07:41,359 --> 00:07:43,761
Brown:
We're going to need
to seal off this lot.

00:07:43,828 --> 00:07:45,930
Tyner told you
what happened here.

00:07:45,997 --> 00:07:47,398
Whose side are you on?

00:07:47,465 --> 00:07:48,500
The officer told me

00:07:48,566 --> 00:07:50,568
a fleeing suspect
committed suicide.

00:07:50,635 --> 00:07:52,337
I'm just verifying
his account.

00:07:52,403 --> 00:07:54,105
You know how
this works, Brass.

00:07:54,172 --> 00:07:56,274
Can we clear the jeep
so I can do my job?

00:07:56,341 --> 00:07:59,377
Well, at least test the dead
guy's hands for gun residue.

00:07:59,444 --> 00:08:00,879
At that proximity

00:08:00,945 --> 00:08:02,146
G.S.R.'s invalid.

00:08:02,213 --> 00:08:04,616
They'd both be covered,
no matter who fired.

00:08:04,682 --> 00:08:06,384
Can we get back to work?

00:08:06,451 --> 00:08:07,886
Yeah.

00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:14,292
( <i>light buzzing</i> )

00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,029
( <i>door opens</i> )

00:08:19,197 --> 00:08:21,366
You brought
the foundation
of the house

00:08:21,432 --> 00:08:22,600
to our lab.

00:08:22,667 --> 00:08:25,003
It's a six-by-three-foot
section.

00:08:25,069 --> 00:08:27,872
When the concrete dried

00:08:27,939 --> 00:08:31,309
it preserved a partial
impression of our Jane Doe.

00:08:32,677 --> 00:08:34,679
Did you find out anything
about the house?

00:08:34,746 --> 00:08:36,181
I pulled the permits.

00:08:36,247 --> 00:08:38,983
Summercliff was built five years
ago on nothing but desert.

00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:42,587
That would explain
why the body was so desiccated.

00:08:42,654 --> 00:08:45,256
House was sold
subsequent to completion

00:08:45,323 --> 00:08:47,525
so the homeowner
isn't a suspect.

00:08:47,592 --> 00:08:49,894
Homicide is running
a missing persons check.

00:08:49,961 --> 00:08:51,329
( <i>clears throat</i> )

00:08:54,866 --> 00:08:57,468
Well, if it wasn't
for a leaky pipe

00:08:57,535 --> 00:09:00,505
she might have been down there
forever.

00:09:00,572 --> 00:09:03,074
I think our killer was counting
on that.

00:09:11,683 --> 00:09:12,684
Hey.

00:09:14,452 --> 00:09:17,055
Why would a guy speed it
all the way down the Strip

00:09:17,121 --> 00:09:18,823
just to pull over
and cap himself?

00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:22,660
What are you
getting at, Warrick?

00:09:22,727 --> 00:09:26,464
Officer's weapon,
Smith and Wesson 5906.

00:09:26,531 --> 00:09:28,366
Standard issue.

00:09:28,433 --> 00:09:31,202
One bullet missing.

00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:33,671
Nothing standard about that.

00:09:38,576 --> 00:09:40,812
Brass isn't going to like this.

00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:42,680
I don't give a damn
what Brass likes.

00:09:42,747 --> 00:09:44,349
Like I do?

00:09:44,415 --> 00:09:46,317
If Tyner's dirty, he goes down.

00:09:46,384 --> 00:09:49,521
I just know what happens
when you piss off the P.D.

00:09:49,587 --> 00:09:53,758
Yeah, it's war.

00:09:55,827 --> 00:09:57,996
Gil Grissom?

00:09:59,364 --> 00:10:02,367
Or should I call you
Spider Man?

00:10:02,433 --> 00:10:03,668
It's harmless.

00:10:03,735 --> 00:10:05,003
Of course it is.

00:10:05,069 --> 00:10:08,506
Orange-kneed tarantula.

00:10:08,573 --> 00:10:09,707
Nice specimen.

00:10:09,774 --> 00:10:12,911
The tarantula's touch
is very gentle.

00:10:12,977 --> 00:10:14,245
It leaves no prints.

00:10:14,312 --> 00:10:15,980
They move without a trace.

00:10:16,047 --> 00:10:17,382
May I?

00:10:26,057 --> 00:10:28,293
Maybe I should introduce myself.

00:10:28,359 --> 00:10:30,240
Teri Miller does not need
an introduction.

00:10:32,982 --> 00:10:33,903
I need you to make me a face.

00:10:38,182 --> 00:10:39,283
I didn't kill him.

00:10:40,558 --> 00:10:41,626
That's what I told IA.

00:10:41,693 --> 00:10:43,128
It's what I told my superior.

00:10:43,194 --> 00:10:44,496
It's what I'm telling you.

00:10:44,562 --> 00:10:45,563
Officer Tyner, your gun--

00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:47,265
there's a bullet's missing
from the magazine.

00:10:47,332 --> 00:10:48,733
I don't top off.

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,236
I know it's against regulation,
but the 14th bullet

00:10:51,302 --> 00:10:53,705
puts pressure on the spring
and the gun can jam.

00:10:53,772 --> 00:10:55,607
Can anyone confirm your story?

00:10:55,674 --> 00:10:56,775
It's not a story!

00:10:56,841 --> 00:10:58,176
And no...

00:10:58,243 --> 00:11:01,746
I don't tell people
how I carry. Do you?

00:11:01,813 --> 00:11:03,715
Check the other magazines.

00:11:03,782 --> 00:11:05,617
What the hell's
going on here?

00:11:05,684 --> 00:11:08,086
We're just having a talk
with Officer Tyner here.

00:11:08,153 --> 00:11:09,621
Next time, don't
start without me.

00:11:09,688 --> 00:11:10,889
I'm the union rep
on this one.

00:11:10,955 --> 00:11:13,792
Then you should know.
Tyner's magazine--
one bullet shy.

00:11:13,858 --> 00:11:16,261
Is the expended round
still missing?

00:11:16,328 --> 00:11:18,096
It's not in the body,
bullet's a round point

00:11:18,163 --> 00:11:19,597
wound was a through-and-through.

00:11:19,664 --> 00:11:21,199
I did not fire a single round.

00:11:21,266 --> 00:11:22,734
And with a record
like yours

00:11:22,801 --> 00:11:24,269
we're supposed
to just take your word?

00:11:24,336 --> 00:11:25,704
Warrick:
Five civilian
complaints--

00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:28,406
three for excessive force.

00:11:28,473 --> 00:11:30,709
Two IA investigations.

00:11:30,775 --> 00:11:32,310
I was cleared.

00:11:32,377 --> 00:11:34,746
I'm sure you were.

00:11:34,813 --> 00:11:37,482
What is that supposed to mean?
I don't have to take this crap!

00:11:37,549 --> 00:11:41,152
Tyner... sit down,
sit down.

00:11:43,621 --> 00:11:45,290
What you do need
is for these guys

00:11:45,357 --> 00:11:47,392
to go out and find
the missing bullet.

00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:50,929
So what are you waiting for?

00:11:50,996 --> 00:11:55,300
I guess it's a good thing
I sealed off that crime scene.

00:11:58,303 --> 00:12:02,240
It's like a human
Jell-O mold.

00:12:02,307 --> 00:12:04,142
The impression's
only a partial.

00:12:04,209 --> 00:12:06,077
It's not going
to be easy.

00:12:06,144 --> 00:12:09,581
They told me you
were the top forensic
artist in the country.

00:12:09,647 --> 00:12:13,818
And Canada. I didn't
say I couldn't do it.

00:12:17,822 --> 00:12:19,324
Give me your hand.

00:12:19,391 --> 00:12:21,660
You'll enjoy this.

00:12:21,726 --> 00:12:24,062
It's as much science as art.

00:12:48,186 --> 00:12:49,854
It doesn't really
look like anything.

00:12:49,921 --> 00:12:52,857
Miller:
No light, no shadows.

00:12:52,924 --> 00:12:55,126
No shadows,
no perspective.

00:12:55,193 --> 00:12:56,695
Now look.

00:13:03,301 --> 00:13:05,403
So teach me.

00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:06,905
Okay.

00:13:06,971 --> 00:13:09,974
First I'm finishing off
the plaster mold.

00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:13,678
We can't give her life
with only half a face.

00:13:13,745 --> 00:13:16,047
Although not
actually symmetrical

00:13:16,114 --> 00:13:17,916
most faces
appear that way

00:13:17,983 --> 00:13:20,986
and the thin layer
of slip

00:13:21,052 --> 00:13:24,022
makes the plaster and clay
appear seamless.

00:13:27,525 --> 00:13:30,228
Her cheekbones and nasal spine

00:13:30,295 --> 00:13:32,230
indicate Nordic descent.

00:13:32,297 --> 00:13:35,100
I've seen a few
Norwegian brunettes

00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:37,969
but your girl's
probably a blonde.

00:13:47,345 --> 00:13:48,913
Grissom:
Brown eyes?

00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:51,349
I thought
you decided she was Nordic.

00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:53,885
But in this country, brown
is a dominant eye color

00:13:53,952 --> 00:13:55,920
and more importantly,
brown photographs better.

00:13:55,987 --> 00:13:58,289
You want to get her face
out there, don't you?

00:13:58,356 --> 00:14:01,226
Yeah.

00:14:01,292 --> 00:14:05,063
I'm sure someone needs closure

00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:07,399
and somebody else
needs to go to jail.

00:14:09,768 --> 00:14:11,903
Miller:
There she is.

00:14:22,447 --> 00:14:24,182
As we first reported yesterday

00:14:24,249 --> 00:14:26,418
the remains of
an unidentified Caucasian female

00:14:26,484 --> 00:14:28,286
were unearthed in Summercliff.

00:14:28,353 --> 00:14:31,589
The 5'4" woman
was approximately 20 years old.

00:14:31,656 --> 00:14:33,091
Here you go.

00:14:33,158 --> 00:14:35,126
Authorities are asking
for the public's help

00:14:35,193 --> 00:14:36,628
in identifying the victim.

00:14:36,695 --> 00:14:38,797
If you have any information

00:14:38,863 --> 00:14:41,099
please call
the Las Vegas P.D. hotline.

00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:44,602
Hotlines... hit or miss.

00:14:44,669 --> 00:14:46,838
I don't know. In my experience

00:14:46,905 --> 00:14:49,641
people usually remember
a beautiful woman.

00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:56,815
Uh, Nick,
weren't you going to go

00:14:56,881 --> 00:14:58,850
and do the,
uh... at the...?

00:14:58,917 --> 00:15:00,652
Stokes:
Yeah.

00:15:00,719 --> 00:15:03,388
Yeah, okay, I'll do that.

00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:07,726
So I saw Eddie.

00:15:10,128 --> 00:15:14,599
He actually... seemed scared.

00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:17,102
Did that make you happy?

00:15:17,168 --> 00:15:18,636
Um, no.

00:15:18,703 --> 00:15:23,208
I'm not really sure what I feel.

00:15:26,745 --> 00:15:28,747
You're not still in love
with Eddie?

00:15:30,315 --> 00:15:32,550
Catherine, you have
to hand off the case.

00:15:32,617 --> 00:15:35,086
Warrick can just double up.

00:15:35,153 --> 00:15:37,722
Uh, Grissom,
Dr. Robbins wants to see you.

00:15:37,789 --> 00:15:40,025
Something about
your skeleton.

00:15:40,091 --> 00:15:41,993
Okay.

00:15:49,834 --> 00:15:52,470
You have to pass off the case.

00:15:52,537 --> 00:15:54,072
If you compromise
the investigation

00:15:54,139 --> 00:15:55,240
there's no going back.

00:15:55,306 --> 00:15:56,408
You could hurt Eddie

00:15:56,474 --> 00:15:58,109
just as much
as you could help him.

00:16:06,251 --> 00:16:08,753
Hey. I've already seen
the marks on the ribs.

00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,755
Uh-huh, but
did you see

00:16:10,822 --> 00:16:13,325
the hairline fracture
on the posterior skull?

00:16:13,391 --> 00:16:15,493
No.

00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:19,230
Robbins:
Easy to miss, but it screams
blunt-force trauma.

00:16:19,297 --> 00:16:22,100
Also, the middle ear
has three bones.

00:16:22,167 --> 00:16:24,569
They're dusted
with sodium

00:16:24,636 --> 00:16:26,471
and lodged against the malleus

00:16:26,538 --> 00:16:29,307
I found a tiny ball of earwax
with grains of sand.

00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:34,245
Salt and sand.

00:16:35,847 --> 00:16:37,048
Killed at the beach?

00:16:37,115 --> 00:16:39,084
Not ruling it out.

00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,919
Stokes:
Grissom.

00:16:40,986 --> 00:16:42,420
Hey, Doc.

00:16:42,487 --> 00:16:43,755
Hotline's lit up.

00:16:43,822 --> 00:16:45,390
Five callers all ID'd

00:16:45,457 --> 00:16:46,791
the same woman

00:16:46,858 --> 00:16:48,460
and her mother just confirmed.

00:16:52,597 --> 00:16:57,369
I need to know what happened
to my daughter.

00:16:57,435 --> 00:17:02,307
We're trying
to figure that
out for you.

00:17:02,374 --> 00:17:04,743
She was quite an athlete, huh?

00:17:04,809 --> 00:17:06,511
Mm-hmm, yeah.

00:17:08,146 --> 00:17:09,247
Did she scuba dive?

00:17:09,314 --> 00:17:11,316
She'd just been certified.

00:17:11,383 --> 00:17:12,784
Did, uh, Fay

00:17:12,851 --> 00:17:16,554
before she disappeared,
go on any vacation

00:17:16,621 --> 00:17:19,524
go diving or spend
time at the beach?

00:17:19,591 --> 00:17:21,893
No, not that I recall.

00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,728
And she, uh

00:17:23,795 --> 00:17:28,233
lived here with you
until she disappeared?

00:17:28,299 --> 00:17:29,634
No, she had just moved

00:17:29,701 --> 00:17:31,603
in with her boyfriend,
Jason Hendler.

00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:34,072
He still lives
on Medley Place.

00:17:34,139 --> 00:17:35,907
Grissom:
And the, uh

00:17:35,974 --> 00:17:39,277
police interviewed him
after she disappeared?

00:17:39,344 --> 00:17:40,612
A couple of times.

00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:42,480
He had nothing to do with this.

00:17:42,547 --> 00:17:44,949
Well, how do you know that?

00:17:45,016 --> 00:17:47,118
He loved my daughter.

00:17:47,185 --> 00:17:49,120
He was good to her.

00:17:49,187 --> 00:17:53,825
Did they... ever fight?

00:17:53,892 --> 00:17:56,795
The first few months
of a relationship

00:17:56,861 --> 00:17:58,363
nobody fights.

00:18:00,031 --> 00:18:03,368
She was crazy about him.

00:18:03,435 --> 00:18:06,004
( <i>sobbing</i> )

00:18:15,246 --> 00:18:17,182
I've given Eddie Willows
20 lap dances.

00:18:17,248 --> 00:18:18,984
He never got rough
till last night.

00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:20,151
In the parking lot.

00:18:20,218 --> 00:18:21,820
Yeah, he asked me
to go for drinks

00:18:21,886 --> 00:18:24,155
you know,
but out in the parking lot

00:18:24,222 --> 00:18:25,991
he starts kissing on me

00:18:26,057 --> 00:18:28,793
and I kind
of laughed it off, but...

00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,528
then he grabbed me

00:18:30,595 --> 00:18:34,099
and he slams me
against the wall

00:18:34,165 --> 00:18:36,234
and... that pig.

00:18:36,301 --> 00:18:38,837
Hi, Evans

00:18:38,903 --> 00:18:40,205
I'm sorry I'm late.

00:18:40,271 --> 00:18:41,406
I'm Catherine...

00:18:41,473 --> 00:18:42,741
just Catherine.

00:18:42,807 --> 00:18:44,409
I'm a forensic scientist.

00:18:44,476 --> 00:18:47,779
Scientist, wow,
you look so normal.

00:18:47,846 --> 00:18:49,814
Thanks.

00:18:49,881 --> 00:18:51,249
Catherine,
you sure want...?

00:18:51,316 --> 00:18:53,752
Yeah.

00:18:55,487 --> 00:18:57,522
Are those bruises
from last night?

00:18:57,589 --> 00:19:01,393
Yeah, a guy pinned me
against a wall.

00:19:01,459 --> 00:19:03,061
Sexual assault nurse
collect a kit yet?

00:19:03,128 --> 00:19:04,562
Evans:
She just finished.

00:19:04,629 --> 00:19:06,264
Why don't you see
if you can catch her.

00:19:06,331 --> 00:19:08,533
I'd like her to get a sample
from under her fingernails.

00:19:12,437 --> 00:19:15,240
Uh... what kind of sample?

00:19:15,306 --> 00:19:19,077
Anything that might, uh,
show up from a... a struggle.

00:19:19,144 --> 00:19:23,048
You'd think what that nurse took
down below would be enough.

00:19:24,649 --> 00:19:27,218
The weird thing is...

00:19:27,285 --> 00:19:29,621
I liked the guy.

00:19:38,797 --> 00:19:41,566
It's not here.

00:19:41,633 --> 00:19:44,235
Bullets just
don't disappear.

00:19:44,302 --> 00:19:45,770
Sidel:
Excuse me.

00:19:45,837 --> 00:19:48,306
No one's allowed
inside the tape.

00:19:48,373 --> 00:19:49,641
I saw what happened.

00:19:51,476 --> 00:19:53,578
Have you talked
to the police?

00:19:53,645 --> 00:19:55,580
Police make me nervous.

00:19:55,647 --> 00:19:57,916
You guys aren't cops, are you?

00:19:57,983 --> 00:20:00,018
We're crime scene
investigators.

00:20:00,085 --> 00:20:01,920
We need to know
what you saw.

00:20:01,987 --> 00:20:06,825
I was kind of taking a break,
hanging out in a PT Cruiser.

00:20:06,891 --> 00:20:10,562
I was laid back in
the heated driver's seat
when I heard the siren.

00:20:10,628 --> 00:20:12,430
( <i>siren blaring</i> )

00:20:12,497 --> 00:20:14,499
Tyner:
Put your hands on the wheel!

00:20:14,566 --> 00:20:16,034
Suspect:
I didn't do it!

00:20:16,101 --> 00:20:18,236
Whatever you think I did!

00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:21,206
Man, I'm looking
at three strikes.
I'm not going back.

00:20:21,272 --> 00:20:23,274
Just let me show you
my registration.

00:20:23,341 --> 00:20:24,843
No! Hands
on the wheel!

00:20:27,245 --> 00:20:29,481
And just like that,
the officer fired?

00:20:29,547 --> 00:20:31,249
Just like that.

00:20:31,316 --> 00:20:34,152
Sidel:
Missing bullet,
eyewitness...

00:20:34,219 --> 00:20:36,301
we better tell Grissom
we got a war.

00:20:50,109 --> 00:20:51,711
I heard about
your eyewitness.

00:20:51,778 --> 00:20:55,181
A valet who joyrides.

00:20:55,248 --> 00:20:56,683
He sounds reliable.

00:20:56,749 --> 00:20:59,352
So, uh, how's
the thing going

00:20:59,419 --> 00:21:00,887
on Eddie Willows?

00:21:00,953 --> 00:21:01,888
What thing?

00:21:01,954 --> 00:21:03,222
The thing that

00:21:03,289 --> 00:21:04,590
I told Catherine

00:21:04,657 --> 00:21:06,059
to pass off to you.

00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:07,293
Oh, good, um...

00:21:08,661 --> 00:21:10,697
We just put some stuff
through the lab.

00:21:10,763 --> 00:21:12,332
Get hold of the DMV?

00:21:12,398 --> 00:21:14,200
I was just about to.

00:21:15,501 --> 00:21:17,737
Warrick? Why would
you call the DMV

00:21:17,804 --> 00:21:18,971
on a rape charge?

00:21:21,941 --> 00:21:24,043
Okay, I didn't hand it off.

00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:25,712
Really?

00:21:25,778 --> 00:21:27,213
I'm sorry, Warrick.

00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,049
If you want me to suave anyone,
I've got to know the shot.

00:21:30,116 --> 00:21:32,418
I know.
I'm sorry.

00:21:35,922 --> 00:21:37,890
I'm doing this for Lindsey.

00:21:37,957 --> 00:21:40,259
You so much as breathe on the
evidence, it's contaminated

00:21:40,326 --> 00:21:41,594
and I end up the bad guy.

00:21:41,661 --> 00:21:43,730
Eyes, no hands.

00:21:43,796 --> 00:21:45,398
What's the status?

00:21:45,465 --> 00:21:48,801
Skin samples from under
the woman's fingernails

00:21:48,868 --> 00:21:50,670
are consistent with Ed's.

00:21:50,737 --> 00:21:53,806
I saw some bruises

00:21:53,873 --> 00:21:57,210
but Eddie's style
has always been very...

00:21:57,276 --> 00:21:58,578
involved...

00:21:58,644 --> 00:21:59,946
vigorous.

00:22:00,013 --> 00:22:01,414
Vigorous?

00:22:02,448 --> 00:22:04,650
She's trying to tell you
Eddie likes it rough.

00:22:04,717 --> 00:22:06,586
Thank you, Warrick.

00:22:06,652 --> 00:22:08,955
Eddie said that
she was into it.

00:22:09,022 --> 00:22:10,123
He said, she said?

00:22:10,189 --> 00:22:12,458
It's about the evidence,
Catherine.

00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,963
And you may not like
where it takes you.

00:22:20,199 --> 00:22:21,801
So how many grains of sand

00:22:21,868 --> 00:22:23,803
in the ocean, huh?

00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:26,773
I don't care about the ocean,
just the sand in my skeleton.

00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:28,207
Can you pinpoint a beach?

00:22:28,274 --> 00:22:29,308
I don't know.

00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:31,010
I might have to do
some field research.

00:22:31,077 --> 00:22:33,146
Hey, you think Grissom
would send me to Hawaii?

00:22:34,947 --> 00:22:36,616
Why don't you ask him yourself?

00:22:36,683 --> 00:22:39,285
Ask me what?

00:22:39,352 --> 00:22:40,553
Oh, nothing, I, uh...

00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,922
I was just telling
Nick about your sand.

00:22:42,989 --> 00:22:45,258
Well, it's not sand.

00:22:45,325 --> 00:22:46,392
It's not natural anyway.

00:22:46,459 --> 00:22:47,827
Here, check this out.

00:22:49,729 --> 00:22:52,699
Now, if this were natural sand,
the surface would be smooth.

00:22:52,765 --> 00:22:54,867
Now this looks more
like Fremont Street

00:22:54,934 --> 00:22:56,135
on a Saturday night...

00:22:56,202 --> 00:22:57,170
rough.

00:22:57,236 --> 00:22:59,272
Could the particles be
sediment from the concrete

00:22:59,339 --> 00:23:00,640
where we found her?

00:23:00,707 --> 00:23:02,675
No, no way.

00:23:02,742 --> 00:23:05,178
I analyzed the mineral content.
It's feldspar and quartz.

00:23:05,244 --> 00:23:07,680
That's crushed
gray sandstone.

00:23:07,747 --> 00:23:10,083
It's man-made,
in a rock crusher.

00:23:10,149 --> 00:23:11,617
What does that mean?

00:23:11,684 --> 00:23:13,853
It means she wasn't killed
in Hawaii.

00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,822
Other than that...

00:23:15,888 --> 00:23:17,557
he has no idea.

00:23:22,028 --> 00:23:24,530
Is this payback, Warrick?
Is that what this is?

00:23:24,597 --> 00:23:26,666
I was tough on you,
so Officer Tyner takes my heat?

00:23:26,733 --> 00:23:28,034
That's how you
think I work?

00:23:28,101 --> 00:23:30,236
Brass, this has nothing
to do with anything.

00:23:30,303 --> 00:23:31,637

filed charges

00:23:31,704 --> 00:23:33,740

a bleary-eyed car jockey

00:23:33,806 --> 00:23:35,441

from the jeep.

00:23:35,508 --> 00:23:38,111
Eyewitness is a bonus:
Your cop's magazine

00:23:38,177 --> 00:23:39,445
was one bullet shy.

with punk-ass cops who hide

You're just a psycho.

00:24:01,267 --> 00:24:02,869
You don't
deserve a badge.

even drawn your weapon.

This is your fault, Gil.

00:24:24,924 --> 00:24:27,093

My guys will not bend

00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,728
and they will not
be intimidated.

Yeah, I sat in your chair.

is the missing bullet?

somewhere in the jeep.

the bullet

and the treads
covered its tracks.

to the cop's gun,
the case is airtight.

There's a match.

So what did the rape kit say?

00:33:27,749 --> 00:33:30,718
Nonoxynol-9,
polyvinyl alcohol, and...

00:33:31,923 --> 00:33:32,724
Glycerin?

00:33:32,791 --> 00:33:34,292
Yeah.

00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:36,895
It's a contraceptive film.

00:33:38,329 --> 00:33:39,731
What are you drinking?

00:33:39,798 --> 00:33:40,732
Chamomile.

00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:41,866
May I?
Sure.

00:33:41,933 --> 00:33:43,034
Thank you.

00:33:44,936 --> 00:33:47,071
So you used to work at
the French Palace, huh?

00:33:47,138 --> 00:33:49,374
That's right.

00:33:49,441 --> 00:33:51,709
You know, my friends and I
used to go there.
Really?

00:33:51,776 --> 00:33:53,244
Payday Fridays.
Uh-huh.

00:33:53,311 --> 00:33:55,814
Maybe I saw you perform?

00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,848
Oh, I doubt it.

00:33:56,915 --> 00:33:57,882
Why?

00:33:57,949 --> 00:34:00,518
You would've remembered.

00:34:02,387 --> 00:34:04,689
So, this film

00:34:04,756 --> 00:34:05,957
it's kind of hard
to detect

00:34:06,024 --> 00:34:07,659
because it dissolves
with body heat.

00:34:07,725 --> 00:34:10,061
And, as you know, Greg

00:34:10,128 --> 00:34:12,230
sex can make a body pretty hot.

00:34:13,465 --> 00:34:15,266
This stuff has to be
inserted

00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:17,869
15 minutes to three hours
before sex.

00:34:17,936 --> 00:34:19,003
Which means that

00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:20,505
April inserted the film

00:34:20,572 --> 00:34:22,440
while she was still at work.

00:34:22,507 --> 00:34:23,708
But how could she have known

00:34:23,775 --> 00:34:25,844
to put the birth control in
before she was raped?

00:34:25,910 --> 00:34:27,912
Exactly.

00:34:34,619 --> 00:34:38,289
Guess where Jason Hendler
was employed five years ago?

00:34:38,356 --> 00:34:40,825
Summercliff
housing development.

00:34:40,892 --> 00:34:42,494
A plumber, perhaps?

00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,162
Close. A subcontractor.

00:34:44,229 --> 00:34:45,563
How'd you know?

00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:47,432
Why else
would you be so excited?

00:34:48,533 --> 00:34:49,534
Hey!

00:34:49,601 --> 00:34:50,902
You weren't
going to say

00:34:50,969 --> 00:34:52,270
good-bye to me?

00:34:52,337 --> 00:34:54,606
I'll meet you outside.

00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,309
Thought I'd let you off easy.

00:34:58,376 --> 00:35:00,445
But I did tack up
my number

00:35:00,512 --> 00:35:03,348
on your big fish corkboard...

00:35:03,415 --> 00:35:04,883
Under "cold cases."

00:35:04,949 --> 00:35:07,218
The ones that got away.

00:35:07,285 --> 00:35:08,920
Let's hope not.

00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,896
So, check it out...

00:35:17,962 --> 00:35:20,799
the laser is the path
of the bullet.

00:35:22,801 --> 00:35:24,335
If you were
Officer Tyner

00:35:24,402 --> 00:35:26,204
and you approached
the suspect

00:35:26,271 --> 00:35:27,906
from the driver's side
of the vehicle...

00:35:27,972 --> 00:35:28,940
Vic was shot

00:35:29,007 --> 00:35:29,941
in the frontal lobe

00:35:30,008 --> 00:35:30,942
through the windshield.

00:35:31,009 --> 00:35:32,410
There's no way I
could shoot the guy

00:35:32,477 --> 00:35:34,846
from here and mimic
that trajectory.

00:35:34,913 --> 00:35:36,981
The laws of physics
trump the eyewitness.

00:35:37,048 --> 00:35:38,983
There's only one way
this could've gone down.

00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:40,118
...show you my registration.

00:35:40,185 --> 00:35:42,353
No! Put your hands on the wheel!

00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,354
( <i>gunshot</i> )

00:35:43,421 --> 00:35:45,090
Officer Tyner
was telling the truth.

00:35:45,156 --> 00:35:47,792
So I bet you think
I owe you one, huh?

00:35:47,859 --> 00:35:50,128
We work. We get paid.

00:35:50,195 --> 00:35:51,362
You don't owe me anything.

00:35:51,429 --> 00:35:54,566
Fine with me.

00:35:57,268 --> 00:35:58,670
He promised me
a million things.

00:35:58,736 --> 00:35:59,871
I got tired
of him lying.

00:35:59,938 --> 00:36:01,506
Like what, marriage, kids?

00:36:01,573 --> 00:36:02,674
Music videos.

00:36:02,741 --> 00:36:04,275
He kept telling me
he'd put me in one

00:36:04,342 --> 00:36:05,510
but he never delivered.

00:36:05,577 --> 00:36:08,813
And for that you
set him up for rape?

00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,014
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:36:10,081 --> 00:36:12,317
No, it wasn't supposed
to go this far, okay?

00:36:12,383 --> 00:36:13,818
I got this friend
over at the Trop.

00:36:13,885 --> 00:36:15,620
She got this high roller
on a rape charge.

00:36:15,687 --> 00:36:17,989
He paid a ton
to make it go away.

00:36:18,056 --> 00:36:21,126
Wait a minute. You think
that Eddie's got money?

00:36:21,192 --> 00:36:23,561
He is in
the music business.

00:36:23,628 --> 00:36:26,097
He reps some bands Off-Strip.

00:36:26,164 --> 00:36:28,533
No, I met a producer
friend of his from L.A.

00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:33,338
and he's always throwing
money around this place.

00:36:33,404 --> 00:36:36,741
( <i>laughs</i> )

00:36:36,808 --> 00:36:38,943
What?

00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:42,180
What's so funny?

00:36:42,247 --> 00:36:43,748
Nothing.

00:36:51,589 --> 00:36:55,527
I see you've cleaned house.
I thought you might.

00:36:55,593 --> 00:36:56,828
I vacuumed up the sand.
Big deal.

00:36:56,895 --> 00:36:58,696
Will you at least tell me
what you're doing here?

00:36:59,764 --> 00:37:01,800
I'm working, sir.

00:37:01,866 --> 00:37:03,768
Officer, would you hit
the lights, please?

00:37:08,973 --> 00:37:10,241
You're getting
my floor wet.

00:37:10,308 --> 00:37:13,411
It's luminol, sir.
It dries quickly.

00:37:16,448 --> 00:37:18,283
Surface is non-reactive.


00:37:18,349 --> 00:37:21,219
I know what you're doing.
You're looking for blood.

00:37:21,286 --> 00:37:23,721
My husband didn't
do anything.

00:37:23,788 --> 00:37:24,856
Why are you
harassing him?

00:37:24,923 --> 00:37:26,324
Let's try the ALS.

00:37:26,391 --> 00:37:28,193
Why use the alternate
light source

00:37:28,259 --> 00:37:30,128
if the luminol didn't
pick up anything?

00:37:30,195 --> 00:37:31,596
Luminol works on the surface

00:37:31,663 --> 00:37:34,466
ALS chases the protein
molecules in blood.

00:37:34,532 --> 00:37:36,267
It actually
penetrates the wood.

00:37:36,334 --> 00:37:38,436
These floorboards are
all made of maple.

00:37:38,503 --> 00:37:41,539
High-end, but
they've been lacquered.

00:37:43,441 --> 00:37:44,709
Who lacquers maple

00:37:44,776 --> 00:37:47,479
unless they're trying
to hide something?

00:38:06,731 --> 00:38:08,433
Turn it off, Nick.

00:38:09,901 --> 00:38:11,970
Officer, hit the lights, please.

00:38:12,036 --> 00:38:14,639
Mr. Hendler

00:38:14,706 --> 00:38:17,208
let me tell you
what I think happened to Fay.

00:38:17,275 --> 00:38:18,643
On the night
of her disappearance

00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:20,345
the two of you
got in a heated argument.

00:38:20,412 --> 00:38:22,480
Don't you walk away from me!

00:38:28,219 --> 00:38:31,022
Suffering a concussion,
Fay falls to the floor.

00:38:31,089 --> 00:38:32,757
In the heat
of the moment

00:38:32,824 --> 00:38:34,692
you decide
to make it final.

00:38:34,759 --> 00:38:37,128
But Fay surprises you:
she fights back.

00:38:37,195 --> 00:38:39,397
She pushes you off.
She crawls a few feet away

00:38:39,464 --> 00:38:41,332
and you move in
for the final attack.

00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:47,605
One thing that
I don't know though

00:38:47,672 --> 00:38:50,175
what did you use to kill her?

00:38:50,241 --> 00:38:52,544
I didn't kill her.

00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:54,512
Well, whatever the weapon

00:38:54,579 --> 00:38:56,214
it wasn't a knife,
but it worked.

00:38:56,281 --> 00:38:57,949
You drove her body
over to Summercliff

00:38:58,016 --> 00:38:59,250
where you were employed

00:38:59,317 --> 00:39:01,186
and you buried her
in wet concrete.
I worked

00:39:01,252 --> 00:39:02,687
the Summercliff job
less than a week.

00:39:02,754 --> 00:39:04,456
Ask Amy; she worked
for the same contractor.

00:39:04,522 --> 00:39:06,191
That's right.
He got a better job

00:39:06,257 --> 00:39:07,459
in Reno.

00:39:07,525 --> 00:39:10,462
Jason wasn't even in Vegas
when Fay disappeared.

00:39:10,528 --> 00:39:12,630
Yeah, you painted the floors,
covered your tracks

00:39:12,697 --> 00:39:14,566
for what, aesthetic reasons?

00:39:14,632 --> 00:39:16,968
Five years
is a long time

00:39:17,035 --> 00:39:19,304
but eventually the past
catches up to everybody.

00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:21,039
I didn't kill Fay!

00:39:21,106 --> 00:39:23,108
I loved her.
I still love her.

00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:34,085
Amy, I'm sorry.

00:39:34,152 --> 00:39:36,855
I'm sorry.

00:39:36,921 --> 00:39:40,191
You still love her?

00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,496
Officer,
would you please

00:39:44,562 --> 00:39:46,097
arrest Mr. Hendler?

00:39:50,068 --> 00:39:52,270
Call my father.
He'll get a lawyer.

00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:00,545
I'll ride along with the cops.

00:40:00,612 --> 00:40:02,113
Bring Homicide
up to speed.

00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:04,382
This is now
a fresh crime scene.

00:40:04,449 --> 00:40:05,717
I'll get to work.

00:40:28,006 --> 00:40:33,178
Grissom:
<i>"...the instrument had</i>
<i>to be slightly curved</i>

00:40:33,244 --> 00:40:37,215
<i>"with some kind</i>
<i>of serrated edge</i>

00:40:37,282 --> 00:40:39,684
<i>like crocodile teeth..."</i>

00:40:39,751 --> 00:40:43,655
Mrs. Hendler, do you and your
husband do much rock climbing?

00:40:43,721 --> 00:40:45,056
( <i>gun cocks</i> )
Yes.

00:40:45,123 --> 00:40:47,659
That's what I killed her with.

00:40:49,561 --> 00:40:52,330
I can prove I was in Reno
when Fay disappeared.

00:40:52,397 --> 00:40:55,700
I've got records.

00:40:55,767 --> 00:40:57,602
You don't want to talk, fine.

00:40:57,669 --> 00:41:00,338
But I've got a question for you.

00:41:00,405 --> 00:41:02,273
Why do you care so much
about the floors?

00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:04,542
I mean, Amy paints them
every spring.

00:41:04,609 --> 00:41:06,211
It's no big deal.

00:41:12,584 --> 00:41:15,787
Jason was in Reno.

00:41:15,854 --> 00:41:18,356
I came here to tell Fay

00:41:18,423 --> 00:41:23,128
that we would be
together again one day.

00:41:23,194 --> 00:41:26,364
Mrs. Hendler, put the gun down.

00:41:26,431 --> 00:41:28,533
Do you know he was engaged to me
when he met her?

00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,335
Where are you going?

00:41:30,401 --> 00:41:31,369
Stop it!

00:41:35,106 --> 00:41:38,810
There was blood everywhere.

00:41:40,845 --> 00:41:45,483
No one else could see it.

00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:48,219
But I knew it was there.

00:41:51,289 --> 00:41:54,559
A dead body is so heavy.

00:41:54,626 --> 00:41:59,297
Mrs. Hendler,
I'm a good listener.

00:41:59,364 --> 00:42:00,732
You've got to give me the gun.

00:42:00,799 --> 00:42:03,067
I can't!

00:42:05,236 --> 00:42:06,538
I'm sorry.

00:42:06,604 --> 00:42:07,939
No, wait.

00:42:08,006 --> 00:42:09,207
But you arrested my husband.

00:42:09,274 --> 00:42:10,241
Wait!

00:42:10,308 --> 00:42:11,743
Mrs. Hendler.

00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:12,911
Nick, don't move.

00:42:12,977 --> 00:42:15,280
Please.

00:42:15,346 --> 00:42:17,982
I don't want to fire my gun
any more than you do.

00:42:20,351 --> 00:42:21,820
For five years

00:42:21,886 --> 00:42:23,822
you've been washing
the blood off your hands.

00:42:26,458 --> 00:42:29,861
Let's put down the guns.

00:42:49,948 --> 00:42:51,082
You okay, Nick?

00:42:51,149 --> 00:42:52,951
Yeah.

00:42:53,017 --> 00:42:54,419
Come on.

00:43:21,079 --> 00:43:22,247
Morning.

00:43:22,313 --> 00:43:23,948
( <i>bike bell rings</i> )

00:43:24,015 --> 00:43:26,050
Morning.

00:43:28,987 --> 00:43:30,121
Please don't tell me

00:43:30,188 --> 00:43:31,956
that you're in trouble
again already.

00:43:32,023 --> 00:43:33,992
You weren't home.
I figured you'd be here.

00:43:34,058 --> 00:43:35,160
Lindsey loves this park.

00:43:37,729 --> 00:43:39,564
So, I thought I'd take you
out to breakfast.

00:43:39,631 --> 00:43:41,099
Say thank you.

00:43:41,166 --> 00:43:42,434
You're welcome.

00:43:46,871 --> 00:43:48,907
I don't think
that's such a good idea, though.

00:43:52,277 --> 00:43:57,182
Cath, when are we going to talk
about what happened between us?

00:43:57,248 --> 00:44:01,719
What's to talk about?

00:44:01,786 --> 00:44:03,822
You cheated on me.

00:44:03,888 --> 00:44:06,491
I caught you.

00:44:06,558 --> 00:44:08,560
I've got a new life.

00:44:11,262 --> 00:44:13,765
Cath...

00:44:13,832 --> 00:44:18,169
Come on...

00:44:18,236 --> 00:44:21,406
why do you fight
the one thing we're good at?

00:44:22,774 --> 00:44:24,309
Daddy!

00:44:24,375 --> 00:44:25,677
Daddy!

00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:30,248
There's my little girl.
