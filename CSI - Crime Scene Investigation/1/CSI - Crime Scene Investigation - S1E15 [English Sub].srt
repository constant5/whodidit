Well, thank you, Sheriff.

00:00:30,995 --> 00:00:32,663
Your presence here
means a lot tonight.

00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:33,597
Is that for me?

about the glass

00:00:35,966 --> 00:00:38,102
I was talking about
the smile on your face.

00:00:38,169 --> 00:00:41,438
( <i>laughing</i> ):
Well, if I'm smiling,
it's because we raised

00:00:41,505 --> 00:00:44,909
$1.6 million for
Mrs. Richmond's
Burn Center tonight.

00:00:44,975 --> 00:00:47,878
That sort of generosity

00:00:47,945 --> 00:00:50,881

of the glass, huh?

Do you know whose

00:01:51,342 --> 00:01:53,978
To know this town

Portia Richmond was

That's not her.

00:02:00,784 --> 00:02:02,052
Maybe 30 years ago

00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:05,022

at the Lido de Paris.

All right, you guys,
like I said on the phone


00:02:58,926 --> 00:03:00,795
it was a big party
and it's a huge house


00:03:00,861 --> 00:03:02,696

you got the pool area.

You want to get
out of there, sir?


00:04:45,266 --> 00:04:46,500
The pool closed at sundown.


00:04:46,567 --> 00:04:48,169

00:04:48,235 --> 00:04:49,637
Yeah, please.

What'd you find?


00:04:51,172 --> 00:04:53,274
Looks like a cufflink.

Initials "C.M."

Turquoise and silver.

maybe Arizona,
New Mexico, Texas.

Working on it.

Well, according
to her friends

00:07:24,203 --> 00:07:25,304
she's been romancing

00:07:25,371 --> 00:07:27,373
some young stallion
for over a month.

00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:28,407
She's in love.

00:07:28,474 --> 00:07:29,808
She's cruising
the Mediterranean

00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:31,410
on some yacht,
eating cheese cubes.

00:07:31,477 --> 00:07:34,013
Got a couple
watching the house.

00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:36,482
Apparently, she
often takes in strays.

Hi.

00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:48,360
Do you mind if we ask you
a few more questions?

00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:50,729
By all means.

00:07:50,796 --> 00:07:53,799
How is it that you
know Portia Richmond?

00:07:53,866 --> 00:07:55,801
Oh, we met her
at the Murado

00:07:55,868 --> 00:07:58,170
at the top
of the Mediterranean.

00:07:58,237 --> 00:08:00,673
You need an oil well
in your backyard
to belong to that place.

00:08:00,739 --> 00:08:02,708
Private club,
50 grand a year

00:08:02,775 --> 00:08:04,176
just to walk
through the door.

00:08:04,243 --> 00:08:05,644
But worth every penny.

00:08:05,711 --> 00:08:08,414
It was like we'd known
Portia all our lives.

00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,316
Does that ever happen to you?

00:08:10,382 --> 00:08:11,317
No.

00:08:11,383 --> 00:08:13,886
PATRICK:
We were new in town.

00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:16,955
Portia introduced us around,
and took us under her wing.

00:08:17,022 --> 00:08:20,059
We were from back East,
and we had mutual acquaintances.

00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,694
And you're house-sitting?

00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,095
Or you're living in?

00:08:23,162 --> 00:08:25,764
House-sitting while hunting
for our own place.

00:08:25,831 --> 00:08:28,133
Portia refused to take
any money from us.

00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,569
She wouldn't even let
us pay for a dinner.

00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:32,738
PATRICK:
That's why when she
took off to Europe...

00:08:32,805 --> 00:08:33,872
AMANDA:
We offered to host

00:08:33,939 --> 00:08:35,040
this charity event.

00:08:35,107 --> 00:08:36,508
It's the least we could do.

00:08:36,575 --> 00:08:39,578
After all, we know how
to throw a party.

00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:41,880
You can say that again.

00:08:41,947 --> 00:08:44,583
Did you know the
deceased woman?

00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,585
No.

00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,455
And you, Miss?

00:08:49,521 --> 00:08:51,357
Well, as far as I know

00:08:51,423 --> 00:08:54,159
she wasn't even
on the guest list.

00:08:58,097 --> 00:08:59,598
Something wrong?

00:08:59,665 --> 00:09:02,001
Yes.

She was here last night.

00:09:16,582 --> 00:09:17,816
Unbelievable.

00:09:17,883 --> 00:09:20,419
Could you put us in
touch with someone

00:09:20,486 --> 00:09:21,553
who was close to her?

00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,855
Sure. Rachel Carson.

00:09:22,921 --> 00:09:24,390
They were best friends.

00:09:24,456 --> 00:09:25,691
Like sisters.

00:09:25,758 --> 00:09:27,126
She's in back.

00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:28,527
Follow me.

00:09:30,462 --> 00:09:32,097
Close your mouth.

00:09:35,134 --> 00:09:38,370
She was seeing some
rich married guy.

00:09:38,437 --> 00:09:40,306
Did he have a name?

00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:41,940
Yeah, but she
wouldn't tell me.

00:09:42,007 --> 00:09:44,076
You know, that's the
thing, it was so weird.

00:09:44,143 --> 00:09:46,312
He refused to tell her
anything about himself.

00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:47,813
Anything.

00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,081
I told her it gave
me the creeps

00:09:49,148 --> 00:09:50,282
but you couldn't
talk to her.

00:09:50,349 --> 00:09:51,583

Hi.

00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:12,004
Do you need
a hand with that?

00:10:12,071 --> 00:10:14,606
Uh... no, thanks.

00:10:14,673 --> 00:10:16,608
I'll be fine.

00:10:16,675 --> 00:10:19,011
Are you a doctor?

00:10:19,078 --> 00:10:21,480
Of sorts.

00:10:21,547 --> 00:10:26,051
I'm just, um...
looking around.

00:10:26,118 --> 00:10:28,754
See anything you like?

00:10:30,289 --> 00:10:31,223
Yes.

00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:32,891

00:10:46,338 --> 00:10:48,340
Catherine?

00:10:50,142 --> 00:10:53,278
Tchaikovsky's
"Waltz of the Flowers."

00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,919
What's with the smile?

00:11:04,117 --> 00:11:05,557
It's playing our song.

00:11:13,316 --> 00:11:15,051
Detective Conroy.

00:11:15,117 --> 00:11:16,085
What happened?

00:11:16,152 --> 00:11:17,553
You get bumped
from first class?

00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,989
No. I do my best work solo.

00:11:20,056 --> 00:11:21,557
On the clock, that is.

00:11:21,624 --> 00:11:23,459
What you got?

00:11:23,526 --> 00:11:24,660
Walk-through.

00:11:24,727 --> 00:11:25,761
Risky move.

00:11:25,828 --> 00:11:28,497
The entire Strip can
see into that elevator.

00:11:35,371 --> 00:11:38,674
All around the ten-ring,
once between the eyes.

00:11:38,741 --> 00:11:40,643
Entry wound give you anything?

00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:41,978
Small caliber?

00:11:42,044 --> 00:11:43,913
You like to work solo.

00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,381
Take a look for yourself.

00:11:57,426 --> 00:11:59,195
Any thoughts?

00:12:05,901 --> 00:12:08,404
Professional hit.

00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:15,011
Hey, well, how did
the Knicks make out?

00:12:15,077 --> 00:12:16,579
Better than you.

00:12:16,646 --> 00:12:18,748
( <i>shots firing</i> )

00:12:28,424 --> 00:12:31,560
Times have changed
since the canary days, huh?

00:12:31,627 --> 00:12:33,396
"Canary days?"

00:12:33,462 --> 00:12:34,797
Yeah. Brass told me
back in the day

00:12:34,864 --> 00:12:35,998
when the mob
would make a hit

00:12:36,065 --> 00:12:37,767
they'd leave a canary,
'cause the guy sang.

00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:39,402
And the quarter stands for?

00:12:39,468 --> 00:12:42,271
"Call someone who cares."

00:12:42,338 --> 00:12:43,306
It's almost like

00:12:43,372 --> 00:12:44,607
the guy wants
to get caught.

00:12:44,674 --> 00:12:46,809
When you leave a gun,
you know it's clean.

00:12:46,876 --> 00:12:48,644
The gun just traces
back to itself.

00:12:48,711 --> 00:12:49,845
Killer cut you off at the knees.

00:12:49,912 --> 00:12:50,880
What do you do now?

00:12:50,947 --> 00:12:53,916
All I can do--

00:12:53,983 --> 00:12:57,386
follow protocol.

00:12:57,453 --> 00:12:59,288
You're going to print

00:12:59,355 --> 00:13:00,323
the entire elevator?

00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:04,226
It's like the Circle Bar
on a Friday night...

00:13:04,293 --> 00:13:07,530
Three million people
on top of each other.

00:13:10,533 --> 00:13:11,734
WILLOWS:
Let me guess:

00:13:11,801 --> 00:13:13,369
You're wondering why
Lacey Duvall

00:13:13,436 --> 00:13:15,638
had a music box engraved
to Portia Richmond.

00:13:15,705 --> 00:13:17,406
You think?
Maybe it's
as simple as

00:13:17,473 --> 00:13:20,009
they knew each other
and she gave it to her.

00:13:20,076 --> 00:13:22,345
If they knew each other,
why wasn't she

00:13:22,411 --> 00:13:23,446
on the guest list?

00:13:26,048 --> 00:13:27,550
March 7, 1969
mean anything to you?

00:13:29,218 --> 00:13:31,454
Meant something
to the Richmonds.

00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,622
You know, when Eddie and I

00:13:32,688 --> 00:13:34,323
were first married--
when things were

00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:35,358
kind of good?

00:13:35,424 --> 00:13:36,525
On the anniversary

00:13:36,592 --> 00:13:38,861
of the day we met,
he always gave me a lace teddy.

00:13:40,563 --> 00:13:43,299
Well, I mean, I know
it's not a music box, but...

00:13:43,366 --> 00:13:45,901
Music box, lace teddy,
it's all the same thing.

00:13:45,968 --> 00:13:47,637
It's tradition.

00:13:47,703 --> 00:13:50,106
And the joy of tradition
is in the constant repetition.

00:13:50,172 --> 00:13:52,141
Right.

00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:55,611
( <i>music playing</i> )

00:13:55,678 --> 00:13:57,146
What am I, working
food and beverage

00:13:57,213 --> 00:13:58,180
at one of the hotels?

00:13:58,247 --> 00:13:59,849
I haven't had a day off
in three weeks.

00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:02,285
I mean, if they're going
to call me in, throw me a bone.

00:14:02,351 --> 00:14:03,653
Give me the 419
on the elevator.

00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:05,721
Someone's bitter.
I'm tired.

00:14:05,788 --> 00:14:07,056
You? Tired?

00:14:07,123 --> 00:14:08,257
I thought you never sleep.

00:14:08,324 --> 00:14:09,892
( <i>yawning</i> )

STOKES:
What up, G?

00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,868
You're awake. I hate you.

00:14:18,935 --> 00:14:20,536
A couple of glasses
of Merlot.

00:14:20,603 --> 00:14:22,138
Rack of lamb
on my day off.

00:14:22,204 --> 00:14:23,839
I slept like
a baby yesterday.

00:14:23,906 --> 00:14:25,207
You look horrible.

00:14:25,274 --> 00:14:26,342
Thanks, Greg.

00:14:27,577 --> 00:14:28,544
Don't look at me.

00:14:28,611 --> 00:14:29,946
I've got Sunshine
all night.

00:14:30,012 --> 00:14:31,948
Check for DNA
in the sexual assault kit

00:14:32,014 --> 00:14:33,316
and the fingernail,
please.

00:14:33,382 --> 00:14:35,017
Everything has to be
in CODIS, A.S.A.P.

00:14:35,084 --> 00:14:36,185
Oh, is that all?

00:14:36,252 --> 00:14:38,921
I want to know who's going
to authorize my overtime.

00:14:38,988 --> 00:14:40,323
Suck it up, Greg.

00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:42,024
You're well rested.

00:14:43,893 --> 00:14:45,995
You want a Valium for her?

00:14:46,062 --> 00:14:48,064
I heard that.

00:14:57,773 --> 00:15:00,776
March 7, 1973.

00:15:04,614 --> 00:15:07,016
March 7, 1981.

00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:09,085
March 7, 1956.

00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:15,524
March 7, 1986.

00:15:15,591 --> 00:15:17,393
I bet he gave her one

00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:20,162
every anniversary
until he died.

00:15:20,229 --> 00:15:23,065
She wouldn't give away
a gift this sentimental.

( <i>"Fur Elise" playing</i> )

00:15:28,137 --> 00:15:30,139
It's not "Waltz of the Flowers."

I think that
was the point.

Oh, yeah.

00:16:36,105 --> 00:16:38,341
No, I can't drink
any more coffee.

My body clock is so screwed up.

00:16:40,576 --> 00:16:42,678
I just want a steak and a shot.

00:16:42,745 --> 00:16:43,746
Tut's Tomb.

00:16:43,813 --> 00:16:45,248
Steak and eggs, $1.99.

00:16:46,282 --> 00:16:47,516
Food?

00:16:48,217 --> 00:16:50,152
Good idea. You're on.

00:16:50,219 --> 00:16:51,187
It's what I live for.

00:16:51,254 --> 00:16:53,222
You guys are never
going to believe this.

00:16:53,289 --> 00:16:54,824
You ready?
So much for the steak.

00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:55,858
I'll take the coffee.

00:16:55,925 --> 00:16:56,993
Yeah.

00:16:57,059 --> 00:16:58,294
Okay, sexual assault kit

00:16:58,361 --> 00:16:59,895
on Lacey Duvall--
that showgirl--

00:16:59,962 --> 00:17:02,565
came back positive for semen,
but that's nothing.

00:17:02,632 --> 00:17:03,866
Ran it through CODIS.

00:17:03,933 --> 00:17:06,002
Seminal DNA matches a cold case
from Texas.

00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:07,436
Dead cheerleader!

Ten years ago!

00:17:09,472 --> 00:17:11,540
Two for one.

00:17:11,607 --> 00:17:12,675
Okay, I'm up.

00:17:15,311 --> 00:17:18,648
Sir, I have four criminalists
working on this.

00:17:18,714 --> 00:17:20,182
No...

00:17:20,249 --> 00:17:22,485
As soon as we find
something tangible

00:17:22,551 --> 00:17:25,588
I'll call you, I promise.

00:17:27,256 --> 00:17:28,324
Sheriff?

00:17:28,391 --> 00:17:29,625
Yeah, he calls me every hour.

I can't get anything done.

00:17:30,793 --> 00:17:32,228
Every half for me.

00:17:33,829 --> 00:17:36,065
I hope we didn't
embarrass you.

00:17:36,132 --> 00:17:37,566
A little late for that.

00:17:42,672 --> 00:17:44,040
Yeah, uh...

00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:45,341
Hi.

00:17:45,408 --> 00:17:47,209
I just have
a few more
questions

00:17:47,276 --> 00:17:49,679
about the whereabouts
of Mrs. Richmond.

00:17:49,745 --> 00:17:51,581
Fire away.

00:17:51,647 --> 00:17:53,749
Drinks for anybody else?

00:17:53,816 --> 00:17:55,585
No, thank you.

( <i>clears throat</i> )

00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:06,462
So, let's, uh... let's
just take baby steps.

00:18:06,529 --> 00:18:08,798
Where is she?

00:18:08,864 --> 00:18:11,300
On a yacht somewhere
in the Greek Isles.

00:18:11,367 --> 00:18:12,868
And if someone
wanted to reach her?

00:18:12,935 --> 00:18:14,270
You have a compass?

00:18:14,337 --> 00:18:16,472
Yeah.

00:18:16,539 --> 00:18:19,208
She's incommunicado.

00:18:19,275 --> 00:18:20,743
Big word.

00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:22,612
Have we done something wrong?

00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:29,285
What?

00:18:36,192 --> 00:18:37,994
May I have your straw?

00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:46,669
I... I collect them.

00:18:47,703 --> 00:18:48,704
( <i>laughs</i> )

00:18:54,043 --> 00:18:55,778
Thank you.

00:18:59,215 --> 00:19:01,951
Oh... mind if I look
around a little?

00:19:03,686 --> 00:19:05,021
Have at it.

00:19:15,031 --> 00:19:16,799
The hostesses' bedroom.

00:19:16,866 --> 00:19:17,967
Mm-hmm.

00:19:18,034 --> 00:19:19,135
Too kinky.

00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:22,972
Let me see if Portia took
her bathing suit with her.

00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,541
Here we go.

00:19:45,628 --> 00:19:47,496
WILLOWS:
Uh...

00:19:47,563 --> 00:19:49,865
We've got a bathing suit,
lingerie, jewels

00:19:49,932 --> 00:19:52,768
wallet, bags...

00:19:52,835 --> 00:19:55,938
I'm not so sure
she's gone anywhere.

00:20:00,643 --> 00:20:02,979
Shall we do
the room, too?

00:21:04,774 --> 00:21:07,376
I think the tooth fairy
might have just left us

00:21:07,443 --> 00:21:08,945
a piece of Portia Richmond.

00:21:09,011 --> 00:21:10,179
What?

00:21:10,246 --> 00:21:11,747
Take a look.

00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:14,750
Ugh.

00:21:16,052 --> 00:21:18,287
WILLOWS:
I guess now
we have two cases.

00:21:18,354 --> 00:21:22,024
We've got a body
without a murderer

00:21:22,091 --> 00:21:25,061
and a murder
without a body.

00:21:33,838 --> 00:21:37,308
Oh, man, I got to get a raise
for this.

00:21:37,374 --> 00:21:38,642
Greg...

00:21:38,709 --> 00:21:41,412
why don't you start
the DNA profile on the tooth

00:21:41,479 --> 00:21:43,948
so that we can tell
if it's Portia Richmond.

00:21:44,014 --> 00:21:46,584
Okay, well, but getting
the DNA from the tooth

00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:47,785
is going to be easy.

00:21:47,852 --> 00:21:49,820
What am I supposed
to compare it to?

00:21:49,887 --> 00:21:51,589
How about the toothbrush
and the hairbrush

00:21:51,655 --> 00:21:52,890
that we took from her vanity?

00:21:52,957 --> 00:21:57,194
Why don't you go talk to
the dead-end twins over there?

00:22:11,742 --> 00:22:13,644
Hmm.

00:22:16,847 --> 00:22:20,651
So, either she's extremely
hygienic, or...

00:22:20,718 --> 00:22:22,420
Somebody did some serious
spring cleaning.

00:22:22,486 --> 00:22:24,388
If you want to know
if it's Portia

00:22:24,455 --> 00:22:26,390
you got to get the DNA
somewhere.

00:22:31,128 --> 00:22:33,531
I can't believe
I've been in this
town 20 years

00:22:33,597 --> 00:22:35,666
and I've never seen
the Liberace Museum.

00:22:35,733 --> 00:22:38,235
That's funny, I was just here
a couple days ago.

00:22:38,302 --> 00:22:39,270
I believe it.

00:22:39,336 --> 00:22:41,605
We have all
of Liberace's costumes

00:22:41,672 --> 00:22:42,706
on display here.

00:22:42,773 --> 00:22:45,609
This one, for example,
worn by Mr. Liberace

00:22:45,676 --> 00:22:49,513
in the 1984 World's Fair
in New Orleans.

00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:50,514
Lovely.

00:22:50,581 --> 00:22:51,515
Mmm.

00:22:51,582 --> 00:22:53,751
Did you ever see
one of the old shows?

00:22:53,818 --> 00:22:55,052
The Lido in the '50s?

00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:57,254
Before my time.

00:22:57,321 --> 00:23:00,057
You weren't even born then,
of course.

00:23:00,124 --> 00:23:01,192
Every dancer

00:23:01,258 --> 00:23:02,693
was from France

00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,463
and the attention to detail
in the costumes

00:23:05,529 --> 00:23:06,731
was unparalleled.

00:23:06,797 --> 00:23:09,400
And the audience
dressed to the nines.

00:23:09,467 --> 00:23:10,401
Oh, yeah.

00:23:10,468 --> 00:23:13,637
The town was different then.

00:23:13,704 --> 00:23:15,573
The other great cities--
New York, Chicago

00:23:15,639 --> 00:23:17,641
London--
they restored.

00:23:17,708 --> 00:23:19,744
But in this town, they destroy.

00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:21,746
Hmm.

00:23:21,812 --> 00:23:24,915
So you want to see what belonged
to Portia Richmond?

00:23:24,982 --> 00:23:26,417
Yes, please.

Yeah... um, looks heavy.

00:23:41,499 --> 00:23:44,168
Imagine that on your head,
two shows a night.

00:23:44,235 --> 00:23:49,206
She used over 15 combs
and various epoxies and glues.

00:23:49,273 --> 00:23:51,609
They damn near had to drive
a spike in her head

00:23:51,675 --> 00:23:53,511
to keep it
from falling off.
Ow.

00:23:53,577 --> 00:23:56,313
She lost all her hair.

00:24:05,856 --> 00:24:08,959

00:24:23,441 --> 00:24:25,476
Too bad he wasn't
driving that elevator.

00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:50,735
It ain't free, believe me.

00:25:04,949 --> 00:25:07,118
You okay?

00:25:07,184 --> 00:25:09,019
Yeah. Yeah.

00:25:13,391 --> 00:25:16,460
A long time
since I seen these.

Just talked to Bobby Dawson
in ballistics.

00:25:22,266 --> 00:25:23,667
He ran that .22

00:25:28,172 --> 00:25:29,106
Yeah.

Will you log these
for me?

00:25:30,307 --> 00:25:31,308
Yeah.

00:25:37,481 --> 00:25:39,383
Mandy, you got any prints
off of that quarter

00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:40,518

Well, that only took
45 minutes.

What do you got?

00:25:51,495 --> 00:25:52,696
A hit off

00:25:52,763 --> 00:25:54,865
Patrick Haynes's
social security number.

00:25:54,932 --> 00:25:56,700
There's only one problem.

00:25:56,767 --> 00:26:00,471
He's an eight-month-old infant
that died 10 years ago.

00:26:00,538 --> 00:26:03,407
Same social? You're sure?

00:26:07,578 --> 00:26:08,979
Bam!

I think we have a match, sir.

Excuse me.

So, did I break the law
by not reporting it?

00:27:04,969 --> 00:27:07,538
It's a good idea
that when your
house is robbed

00:27:07,605 --> 00:27:10,274
you report that your
registered gun was stolen.

about having the gun in the
house since we had our boy

00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,082
and I told her
that I'd gotten rid of it

00:27:18,149 --> 00:27:19,116
but I never did.

00:27:19,183 --> 00:27:21,052
I mean, man, the last thing
I ever expected

00:27:21,118 --> 00:27:22,386
was it'd be used
in a murder.

till Mr. Grissom
here told her.

00:28:40,898 --> 00:28:42,333
Is that kind of like
the guy who, uh

00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,401
walks out of
the auto mall

00:28:43,467 --> 00:28:44,869

00:28:49,206 --> 00:28:50,174
may I?

00:28:52,076 --> 00:28:55,513
Mr. Haynes, we ran
a sexual assault kit

00:28:55,579 --> 00:28:56,914
on Lacey Duvall.

00:28:56,981 --> 00:28:58,315
We found semen.

00:28:58,382 --> 00:29:01,185
Can you
explain that?

00:29:01,252 --> 00:29:02,219
Yeah.

00:29:02,286 --> 00:29:04,922
Yeah, my wife's not here.

00:29:04,989 --> 00:29:07,425
Time to convert lies
into the truth.

00:29:07,491 --> 00:29:10,027
I had sex with Lacey
before the party.

00:29:10,094 --> 00:29:12,997
Would you mind giving us
a DNA sample?

00:29:13,064 --> 00:29:16,834
No.

00:29:16,901 --> 00:29:19,970
My relationship with Lacey
was purely sexual.

00:29:20,037 --> 00:29:21,172
It was good sex.

00:29:21,238 --> 00:29:22,506
Well... great sex.

00:29:22,573 --> 00:29:26,110
Whenever we could
steal a moment, uh, we did.

00:29:26,177 --> 00:29:29,113
Just like an addiction.

00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:32,883
Well, in addition to exchanging
bodily fluids

00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:34,885
did you exchange gifts?

00:29:34,952 --> 00:29:37,021
Whatever do you mean?

00:29:37,088 --> 00:29:38,456
Just answer the question.

00:29:38,522 --> 00:29:39,590
No.

00:29:39,657 --> 00:29:43,394
No, I never gave her anything.

00:29:43,461 --> 00:29:46,564
We found a music box
in Lacey Duvall's dressing area

00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:48,632
that belonged
to Portia Richmond.

00:29:48,699 --> 00:29:52,036
Did you give
it to her?

00:29:52,103 --> 00:29:54,405
Honestly... no.

00:29:54,472 --> 00:29:57,742
Those music boxes
belonged to Portia,
not to me.

00:29:57,808 --> 00:30:02,546
But Lacey had been by the house
and she did admire them.

00:30:02,613 --> 00:30:04,382
You saying that she lifted it?

00:30:04,448 --> 00:30:06,083
Human nature.

00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:10,654
We always covet
what we can't have.

00:30:15,259 --> 00:30:18,996
What did you covet
from Portia Richmond?

Sometimes in

you get one chance;

00:30:47,191 --> 00:30:49,160
And while I'm out here
screwing around with you

00:30:49,226 --> 00:30:50,828
he's in there
thinking up an answer

that he didn't have
before you walked in.

00:30:52,863 --> 00:30:55,666
We matched the DNA

00:30:55,733 --> 00:30:58,369
to a cold case in
Texas ten years ago.

00:30:58,436 --> 00:30:59,603
And?

00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:01,639

was Chad Matthews.

So, Patrick Haynes
is Chad Matthews

00:31:19,957 --> 00:31:23,127
and Chad Matthews
is on the run.

00:31:23,194 --> 00:31:25,930

what the hot topic
of conversation is going to be

00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:42,198
when I walk
into that breakfast?

00:31:45,101 --> 00:31:46,269
That's cute.

is in custody.

00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,338
Does he have
anything to do

vanishing act?

00:31:51,274 --> 00:31:52,308
Haynes is in lockup

on an unrelated matter.

So in the meanwhile

00:31:56,512 --> 00:31:57,980
we're questioning him

00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,195
Still looking.

00:32:12,261 --> 00:32:13,563
Well, look harder,
'cause if someone

00:32:13,629 --> 00:32:15,264
leaks it to the press
that she's dead

00:32:15,331 --> 00:32:17,834
and then she gets off a Lear Jet
at McCarran with a tan

00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,702
we're both going to have
egg on our face

00:32:19,769 --> 00:32:21,471
and I'm going to hold
you responsible.

00:32:21,537 --> 00:32:24,440
Portia Richmond
got me elected, Grissom.

00:32:24,507 --> 00:32:25,908
I was at her party.

00:32:25,975 --> 00:32:27,777
Do you see what this
does to me?

00:32:27,844 --> 00:32:29,779
Evidence is like
fine wine, Brian.

00:32:29,846 --> 00:32:32,415
You can't just open the
bottle and drink it.

00:32:32,482 --> 00:32:35,118
You got to let it breathe.

00:32:35,184 --> 00:32:37,653
Look, I'm going to lay this
on the line right here and now.

00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,489
You find me
Portia Richmond

00:32:39,555 --> 00:32:41,190
or you find me
a motive for her murder

00:32:41,257 --> 00:32:43,259
'cause I'm in your kitchen
till it's solved.

00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,202
Make yourself at home.

00:32:50,269 --> 00:32:51,670
Where you been?

00:32:51,737 --> 00:32:53,172
Proctologist.

00:32:53,238 --> 00:32:55,374
Sheriff getting your ass, huh?

00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,076
Well, I just hit megabucks.

00:32:58,143 --> 00:33:00,979
Austin PD has five aliases
for Chad Matthews.

00:33:01,046 --> 00:33:03,515
Tom Sheridan,
wanted in Beacham County.

00:33:03,582 --> 00:33:05,317
Petty theft,
check fraud.

00:33:05,384 --> 00:33:08,153
Warner Drysdale,
wanted in Sacramento.

00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,088
Grand larceny, car theft.

00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:12,324
Guy took a car
for a test drive...

00:33:12,391 --> 00:33:13,825
never brought it back.

00:33:13,892 --> 00:33:16,862
Jock Jasper-- I'm not
making these names up--

00:33:16,929 --> 00:33:21,266
extorted money
from a rich widow in Denver.

00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:22,734
Busy boy.

00:33:22,801 --> 00:33:24,002
Yeah, and organized, too.

00:33:24,069 --> 00:33:26,271
The Denver PD sent me
copies of his journal.

00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:27,739
Guy kept lists
of rich women

00:33:27,806 --> 00:33:28,974
all around the country.

00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:30,475
Logged in all their vitals.

00:33:30,542 --> 00:33:33,645
Height, weight, how much money
they have, you name it.

00:33:33,712 --> 00:33:35,013
Guess who was on that list.

00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,182
Does her name begin with a "P"?

00:33:37,249 --> 00:33:39,384
Well, according
to her credit card statements

00:33:39,451 --> 00:33:41,119
Portia Richmond
hasn't spent a dime

00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:42,988
since she's been
in the Mediterranean.

00:33:43,055 --> 00:33:44,423
She's dead.

00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:45,691
Oh, not necessarily.

00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:48,193
Maybe she's been...
swept off her feet.

00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:51,663
Hmm. Yeah, some guys still
like to foot the bill.

00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:53,165
Really? How would you know?

00:33:53,232 --> 00:33:54,533
Hey, I only go Dutch

00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,768
if girls ask
the wrong question.

00:33:56,835 --> 00:33:58,270
And what question is that, Nick?

00:33:58,337 --> 00:33:59,872
"What do you drive?"

00:33:59,938 --> 00:34:01,507
It's an honest question.

00:34:01,573 --> 00:34:02,574
No. No, it's not.

00:34:02,641 --> 00:34:04,710
What it means is, "How
much money do you make

00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:06,044
so you can take care of me."

00:34:07,105 --> 00:34:08,640
Well, not this girl.

00:34:08,707 --> 00:34:11,843
Boys and girls, we've
got ourselves a forgery.

00:34:11,910 --> 00:34:15,647
Ooh. Either that
or a dimpled ballot.

00:34:15,714 --> 00:34:17,716
Well, his name <i>is</i> Chad.

00:34:17,782 --> 00:34:18,917
Hmm.

00:34:18,984 --> 00:34:20,619
Let's connect the dots.

00:34:20,685 --> 00:34:21,820
What does that mean?

00:34:21,887 --> 00:34:23,054
Here, I'll show you.

00:34:23,121 --> 00:34:25,190
Catherine, you wear
pierced earrings. May I?

00:34:25,257 --> 00:34:29,761
All right, but...
I've had them on for a week.

00:34:29,828 --> 00:34:31,930
Can't account for what's on it.

00:34:31,997 --> 00:34:33,331
Sign your name, please.

00:34:33,398 --> 00:34:34,666
Okay.

00:34:34,733 --> 00:34:37,002
Now, nobody signs
their signature

00:34:37,068 --> 00:34:38,537
exactly the same way twice.

00:34:38,603 --> 00:34:40,805
Not even you,
chicken scratch.

00:34:40,872 --> 00:34:43,808
If they do, then one
of them's a forgery.

00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:46,945
Here's where connecting
the dots comes in.

00:34:47,012 --> 00:34:51,349
We dot the lines...
and curves... of the signature.

00:34:51,416 --> 00:34:53,451
WILLOWS:
Which leaves indentations
on the blank page

00:34:53,518 --> 00:34:56,388
and then you connect the dots,
get rid of the evidence...

00:34:56,454 --> 00:34:58,757
but, obviously
they didn't.

00:34:58,823 --> 00:35:00,525
Well, that's scary.

00:35:00,592 --> 00:35:02,694
All you need is one signature
to break somebody.

00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:11,570
You look terrible.

00:35:11,636 --> 00:35:13,905
I been spinning my wheels.

00:35:13,972 --> 00:35:16,341
I'm never going
to solve this case.

00:35:16,408 --> 00:35:18,376
It was over before it began.

00:35:18,443 --> 00:35:19,911
That doesn't sound like you.

00:35:19,978 --> 00:35:20,912
I got a dead man

00:35:20,979 --> 00:35:22,614
in a glass elevator

00:35:22,681 --> 00:35:27,018
with a bazillion prints
and a .22 caliber bullet.

00:35:27,085 --> 00:35:29,421
It's virtually untraceable.

00:35:29,487 --> 00:35:30,555
He left the gun at the scene.

00:35:30,622 --> 00:35:31,556
You know what that means.

00:35:31,623 --> 00:35:33,925
Hit man with a ghost.

00:35:36,328 --> 00:35:38,096
But I got two
things left, right?

00:35:38,163 --> 00:35:39,731
Make that one thing.

00:35:39,798 --> 00:35:41,032
You got to be kidding me.

00:35:41,099 --> 00:35:42,033
It gets worse.

00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,502
Got a print off your quarter.

00:35:43,568 --> 00:35:44,503
Ran it through AFIS.

00:35:44,569 --> 00:35:45,804
Came back your dead man.

00:35:57,682 --> 00:35:59,150
Pretty gruesome.

00:36:04,523 --> 00:36:05,857
Want to share?

00:36:09,961 --> 00:36:12,364
I was just thinking
what old man Binion

00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:14,466
told Steve Wynn
when he hit town.

00:36:14,533 --> 00:36:17,102
Always give a gambler
an excuse to gamble

00:36:17,169 --> 00:36:18,904
and he'll thank you for it.

00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:21,473
Was your guy a gambler?

00:36:22,474 --> 00:36:25,744
A bunch of cash receipts
in his pocket.

00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:28,780
Markers all over town.

00:36:28,847 --> 00:36:32,450
Once you get to that place

00:36:32,517 --> 00:36:34,052
there's no getting out.

00:36:37,389 --> 00:36:39,057
Who picked this place?

00:36:39,124 --> 00:36:41,993
Me. I thought it
would be nice.

00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:44,296
Okay, you can pick up the tab.

00:36:44,362 --> 00:36:46,765
Let's keep talking about motive.

00:36:46,832 --> 00:36:48,567
Let's. I don't think
a forged signature

00:36:48,633 --> 00:36:49,801
is a slam dunk for murder.

00:36:49,868 --> 00:36:51,102
Hey, did anyone
tell Grissom

00:36:51,169 --> 00:36:52,370
where we were
having lunch?

00:36:52,437 --> 00:36:53,905
Yeah, Dispatch
left him a message.

00:36:53,972 --> 00:36:56,308
Maybe he thought
it was the sheriff
and blew it off.

00:36:56,374 --> 00:36:57,442
Right.

00:37:18,597 --> 00:37:20,298
Hey! You might want to take

00:37:20,365 --> 00:37:22,033
your face
away from that.

00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,101
Really?

00:37:23,168 --> 00:37:25,070
Why is that?

00:37:30,108 --> 00:37:32,477
SIDLE:
<i>This Chilean sea bass</i>

00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:33,478
is wonderful.

00:37:33,545 --> 00:37:35,380
So is this.

00:37:35,447 --> 00:37:36,815
Okay, you got
your missing widow.

00:37:36,882 --> 00:37:37,816
Her bloody tooth

00:37:37,883 --> 00:37:39,651
found in her own bedroom

00:37:39,718 --> 00:37:41,553
which is currently occupied
by two moes.

00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:43,054
"Moes." I'm rubbing
off on you.

00:37:43,121 --> 00:37:45,123
No, you're not, and stay
out of my sea bass.

00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:46,191
Oh, that <i>is</i> good.

00:37:46,258 --> 00:37:48,160
One of our moes has
six names that we know of

00:37:48,226 --> 00:37:49,261
including Chad Matthews.

00:37:49,327 --> 00:37:50,962
Right, right, and
we've got a cuff link

00:37:51,029 --> 00:37:53,365
with the initials C.M.
found in the bottom of the pool

00:37:53,431 --> 00:37:54,733
along with
a floating showgirl.

00:37:54,799 --> 00:37:56,601
Who was sleeping
with six men

00:37:56,668 --> 00:37:58,670
rolled into one--
Patrick Haynes.

00:37:58,737 --> 00:38:00,605
Hey.

00:38:00,672 --> 00:38:03,141
Photos of your showgirl.

00:38:13,985 --> 00:38:15,187
What did I miss?

00:38:15,253 --> 00:38:16,688
It's not what you missed.

00:38:16,755 --> 00:38:23,261
It's what seems
to be missing.

00:38:23,328 --> 00:38:24,362
A fingernail?

00:38:24,429 --> 00:38:26,264
STOKES:
<i>Okay, Patrick Haynes.</i>

00:38:26,331 --> 00:38:27,532
Or whoever.

00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,534
Whoever. He commits
a murder ten years ago.

00:38:29,601 --> 00:38:30,969
Why give up
your DNA so easily?

00:38:31,036 --> 00:38:33,405
Exactly. I mean, you know,
you can change your name.

00:38:33,471 --> 00:38:34,906
You can't change
your blueprint.

00:38:34,973 --> 00:38:35,907
Right on.

00:38:35,974 --> 00:38:36,908
SIDLE:
Risk versus reward.

00:38:36,975 --> 00:38:39,845
You sleep with someone,
you kill 'em, the heat's on.

00:38:39,911 --> 00:38:43,381
You flee, or, you roll the dice
and maybe you get your cookie.

00:38:43,448 --> 00:38:45,283
What's the cookie?

00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:46,318
The cheese, brother.

00:38:46,384 --> 00:38:47,586
Maybe that 1.6 mil
they raised

00:38:47,652 --> 00:38:48,987
at the charity
event that night.

00:38:49,054 --> 00:38:49,988
The Hayneses controlled

00:38:50,055 --> 00:38:51,156
Portia Richmond's
bank account

00:38:51,223 --> 00:38:52,490
including the Burn
Center account

00:38:52,557 --> 00:38:54,659
but they had to stick around
for the checks to clear.

00:38:54,726 --> 00:38:57,829
So why kill Lacey Duvall?

00:38:57,896 --> 00:38:59,331
Excellent question.

00:38:59,397 --> 00:39:02,133
I don't know, but if Lacey
Duvall hadn't been murdered

00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,768
Patrick Haynes
reinvents himself

00:39:03,835 --> 00:39:06,805
becomes another skippy in
another state, $1.6 mil richer.

00:39:06,872 --> 00:39:08,240
Wait, wait. Time out, now.

00:39:08,306 --> 00:39:10,008
I had half a Caesar
and a coffee.

00:39:10,075 --> 00:39:11,009
How's my end 20 bucks?

00:39:11,076 --> 00:39:12,177
You want to go dutch, Nick?

00:39:12,244 --> 00:39:13,345
Excellent idea, Sara.

00:39:13,411 --> 00:39:14,546
You're catching on.

00:39:14,613 --> 00:39:15,547
I'd love to.

00:39:15,614 --> 00:39:17,516
Uh, Brass, cough it up.

00:39:17,582 --> 00:39:19,084
Cover Nick's, too.

00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:20,986
He had that tiramisu.

00:39:21,052 --> 00:39:24,556
I hate going out to lunch
with you CSIs.

00:39:24,623 --> 00:39:27,159
You notice everything.

00:39:29,027 --> 00:39:29,961
Hey.

00:39:30,028 --> 00:39:31,163
Whatever happened

00:39:31,229 --> 00:39:33,198
to the fingernail
that Catherine found

00:39:33,265 --> 00:39:34,432
at the crime scene?

00:39:34,499 --> 00:39:36,334
Got the results right here.

00:39:36,401 --> 00:39:38,136
First things first.

00:39:38,203 --> 00:39:39,604
Not a match to Patrick Haynes.

00:39:39,671 --> 00:39:42,007
I never figured a man
for the fingernail, Greg.

00:39:42,073 --> 00:39:45,076
Okay, but here's where you break
out the can of creep repellent.

00:39:45,143 --> 00:39:46,444
The fingernail and the semen

00:39:46,511 --> 00:39:48,213
share half
the DNA markers in common.

00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:51,750
Possible first-degree relative?

00:39:54,653 --> 00:39:55,987
Do me a favor.

00:39:58,757 --> 00:40:00,125
Run this for me.

00:40:04,663 --> 00:40:06,198
What is that, lip gloss?

00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:08,667
You tell me.

00:40:09,768 --> 00:40:11,636
BRASS:
On behalf...

00:40:13,104 --> 00:40:14,973
of the state of Nevada

00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,675
my apologies.

00:40:16,741 --> 00:40:18,543
You've been cleared
of all charges.

00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:20,579
It took three of you
to tell me that?

00:40:20,645 --> 00:40:21,580
But...

00:40:21,646 --> 00:40:23,615
on behalf of
the state of Texas

00:40:23,682 --> 00:40:24,983
you're under arrest.

00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:26,184
You're being
extradited

00:40:26,251 --> 00:40:27,853
for the murder
of Lana Grimshaw.

00:40:27,919 --> 00:40:30,021
I slept with her,
but I didn't kill her.

00:40:30,088 --> 00:40:31,256
WILLOWS:
Huh.

00:40:31,323 --> 00:40:33,024
Just like with Lacey Duvall.

00:40:33,091 --> 00:40:34,192
Absolutely.

00:40:34,259 --> 00:40:36,061
Mm-hmm.

00:40:43,134 --> 00:40:44,569
Now I see it.

00:40:44,636 --> 00:40:45,904
What?

00:40:45,971 --> 00:40:47,739
See what?

00:40:47,806 --> 00:40:49,574
The family resemblance.

00:40:49,641 --> 00:40:52,511
Donnie and Marie.

00:40:52,577 --> 00:40:54,880
Brother and sister

00:40:54,946 --> 00:40:58,917
and I got the DNA
to prove it.

00:40:58,984 --> 00:41:00,619
Let me tell you
what else I can prove.

00:41:00,685 --> 00:41:02,687
Your sister...

00:41:02,754 --> 00:41:04,289
killed Lacey Duvall.

00:41:07,726 --> 00:41:08,927
He told me he loves me.

00:41:08,994 --> 00:41:11,096
No more faking love.

00:41:11,163 --> 00:41:12,230
No more acts.

00:41:12,297 --> 00:41:14,065
Is that what he told you?

00:41:14,132 --> 00:41:15,100
That's an act?

00:41:15,167 --> 00:41:16,868
It's as real as it gets.

00:41:16,935 --> 00:41:18,737
Patrick says you're small time.

00:41:18,803 --> 00:41:21,273
You don't have the stones
to go big.

00:41:21,339 --> 00:41:22,941
You don't know Patrick.

00:41:23,008 --> 00:41:24,976
You mean Chad?

00:41:25,043 --> 00:41:27,312
He gave me this.

00:41:27,379 --> 00:41:28,980
You know
what's next.

00:41:29,047 --> 00:41:30,549
It's my turn.

00:41:34,352 --> 00:41:35,220
( <i>snap</i> )

00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:44,629
You're surprised?

00:41:44,696 --> 00:41:46,965
Look at your face.

00:41:47,032 --> 00:41:48,567
You never made a mistake

00:41:48,633 --> 00:41:49,634
until you met her.

00:41:49,701 --> 00:41:50,702
You killed Lacey

00:41:50,769 --> 00:41:52,170
because I told
her about us?

00:41:52,237 --> 00:41:54,172
I had no choice.

00:41:54,239 --> 00:41:55,807
We were partners.

00:41:55,874 --> 00:41:58,977
You can't grift me, Chad.

00:41:59,044 --> 00:42:00,245
Uh...

00:42:00,312 --> 00:42:03,849
Who wants to tell us
about Portia Richmond?

00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:06,818
She's in Europe.

00:42:06,885 --> 00:42:09,654
On a yacht, in Greece.

00:42:09,721 --> 00:42:12,123
Oh, right. She's incommunicado.

00:42:13,358 --> 00:42:15,260
Old Testament.

00:42:15,327 --> 00:42:17,596
The Book of Jonah.

00:42:17,662 --> 00:42:19,297
"And now, the Lord arranged

00:42:19,364 --> 00:42:23,835
for a great fish to
swallow up Jonah."

00:42:23,902 --> 00:42:25,837
You know what's wrong
with the piranha, though?

00:42:25,904 --> 00:42:28,440
They've got
high cholesterol.

00:42:28,507 --> 00:42:31,243
Cholesterol is found
in humans, not fish.

00:42:31,309 --> 00:42:35,313
So how does a fish acquire
human cholesterol?

00:42:39,551 --> 00:42:41,586
You want to fill in the blanks?

00:42:43,088 --> 00:42:44,356
Hey, Portia.

00:42:55,333 --> 00:42:58,503
You're both under arrest for
the murder of Portia Richmond.

00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:07,045
These belong
to Tyson Green.

00:43:07,112 --> 00:43:09,915
Just came to let you know
he won't be paying up.

00:43:09,981 --> 00:43:11,316
What's he, dead?

00:43:11,383 --> 00:43:13,285
Yeah.

00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,756
( <i>women screaming</i> )

00:43:19,758 --> 00:43:21,226
It's machine 25 again.

00:43:21,293 --> 00:43:23,195
Been spitting
silver all day.

00:43:23,261 --> 00:43:25,096
It's a good day to gamble.

00:44:15,981 --> 00:44:18,116
WOMAN:
<i>Vegas, NFL football,</i>
<i>a guy like you.</i>

00:44:18,183 --> 00:44:20,785
<i>Come on, you trying to tell me</i>
<i>that you didn't make</i>

00:44:20,852 --> 00:44:22,420
<i>a little pit stop?</i>

00:44:22,487 --> 00:44:26,158
GRISSOM:
<i>What you do on your time</i>
<i>is nobody's business.</i>

00:44:26,224 --> 00:44:28,894
<i>What you do on my time,</i>
<i>is</i> my <i>business.</i>

00:44:30,922 --> 00:44:33,592
MAN:
<i>Warrick Brown had one</i>
<i>of my guys sub for him in</i>
<i>court</i>

00:44:33,658 --> 00:44:37,229
<i>but I have it on good authority</i>
that he was gambling.

00:44:37,295 --> 00:44:39,231
WOMAN:
<i>Warrick has a problem.</i>

00:44:39,297 --> 00:44:41,800
<i>Ignoring it isn't</i>
<i>going to make it go away.</i>

00:44:41,867 --> 00:44:44,302
BROWN:
<i>I won't let you down again.</i>
