00:00:21,231 --> 00:00:22,748
<i>My name is Royce Harmon.</i>

00:00:22,816 --> 00:00:27,431
<i>I reside at 7642 Carpenter</i>
<i>Street, Las Vegas, Nevada.</i>

00:00:27,498 --> 00:00:30,409
<i>I am 41 years of age...</i>

00:00:30,476 --> 00:00:33,152
<i>...and I'm going</i>
<i>to kill myself.</i>

00:00:35,727 --> 00:00:39,273
<i>I'd like to say</i>
<i>"I love you" to my mother</i>
<i>Paige</i>

00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,779
<i>and my sister Gina.</i>

00:00:40,845 --> 00:00:42,184
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:44,458
<i>I never wanted</i>
<i>to put you through this.</i>

00:00:44,525 --> 00:00:47,068
<i>I just can't do it anymore.</i>

00:00:47,134 --> 00:00:48,573
<i>I love you, Mom...</i>

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,609
( <i>gunshot</i> )

00:00:49,677 --> 00:00:52,018
( <i>helicopter flying overhead)</i>

00:00:52,086 --> 00:00:53,925
( <i>siren flipping on and off</i> )

00:00:58,374 --> 00:01:00,682
Here comes the nerd squad.

00:01:00,749 --> 00:01:02,321
I hate the legwork.

00:01:02,389 --> 00:01:06,001
I'm telling you, that Deputy
Chief job better come in soon.

00:01:06,068 --> 00:01:08,543
I don't know how much longer
I can put up

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,785
with these damn
public appearances.

00:01:12,189 --> 00:01:13,160
Gentlemen...

00:01:13,226 --> 00:01:14,799
Hey, guys, take
a break, huh?

00:01:37,613 --> 00:01:39,084
Suicide.

00:01:39,152 --> 00:01:40,288
You think so, huh?

00:01:40,356 --> 00:01:42,295
You got the sleeping
bag for easy cleanup

00:01:42,363 --> 00:01:43,834
the bathtub to
catch the bullet

00:01:43,902 --> 00:01:46,343
open window so the stench
alerts the neighbors...

00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:48,584
God bless him.

English. I'm not
an entomologist.

00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:14,174
It's the third stage
of larva metamorphosis.

00:02:14,241 --> 00:02:16,048
This guy's been dead seven days.

00:02:16,115 --> 00:02:19,259
That's a maggot,
and he stinks.

00:02:19,326 --> 00:02:20,965
Oh, good, it's almost 11:00.

00:02:21,032 --> 00:02:23,473
Maybe if I'm lucky
I can break out of here

00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:26,250
in time for a shot
at the first rack
of the Krispy Kreme.

00:02:29,061 --> 00:02:31,804
I think we may have
our suicide note.

00:02:33,409 --> 00:02:36,018
Harmon:
I never wanted
to put you through this.

00:02:36,085 --> 00:02:37,624
I just can't do it anymore.

00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,898
I've lost hope.

00:02:39,965 --> 00:02:41,404
I love you, Mom...

Oh, my God!

00:02:44,615 --> 00:02:46,187
Go upstairs, Gina.

00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,302
This can't be happening.

00:02:50,368 --> 00:02:52,677
We're so sorry about this,
Ms. Harmon.

00:02:52,743 --> 00:02:55,186
I can only imagine how difficult
this must be for you.

00:02:55,253 --> 00:02:59,032
No, you don't understand.

00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:01,943
This is his picture...

Sorry.

Welcome to Forensics.

00:04:29,886 --> 00:04:32,261
Gil Grissom. I'm your supervisor
on graveyard.

00:04:32,328 --> 00:04:33,934
Holly Gribbs.

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,606
Nice office.

00:04:35,673 --> 00:04:38,416
Thanks. Would you mind
taking off your jacket

00:04:38,483 --> 00:04:40,189
and rolling up your sleeve?

00:04:40,256 --> 00:04:41,192
For what?

00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,166
I need a pint
of your blood.

00:04:43,233 --> 00:04:45,574
It's customary
for all new hires.

00:04:45,642 --> 00:04:46,545
Why?

00:04:46,612 --> 00:04:48,987
So many reasons.

00:04:49,053 --> 00:04:52,031
I-I haven't even
clocked in yet.

00:04:52,098 --> 00:04:53,770
( <i>people laughing</i>

00:04:53,837 --> 00:04:55,409
Attention, Command

00:04:55,477 --> 00:04:59,056
One more, baby, one more.

00:04:59,123 --> 00:05:00,159
Hey.

00:05:00,227 --> 00:05:02,401
There he is.
What's up?

00:05:04,642 --> 00:05:09,559
99. You and me,
dead heat.

00:05:09,626 --> 00:05:12,938
Next crime solved gets
promoted to CSI III, man.

00:05:13,005 --> 00:05:15,715
Yeah, yeah, choice of shift,
$8,000 raise

00:05:15,781 --> 00:05:20,163
extra week vacation-- oh-ho,
it's all about Cabo, bro.

00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:24,010
Twenty bucks, by the end
of shift, I'm the man.

00:05:24,077 --> 00:05:26,552
Is there anything
you won't bet on?
Nah.

00:05:26,619 --> 00:05:28,493
It's college
football season, man.

00:05:28,559 --> 00:05:30,298
I won eight of ten
this weekend.

00:05:30,366 --> 00:05:33,343
Kilt 'em. Outside
the Huskers and them
punk-ass Irish

00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:35,383
I'm up about four G's.

00:05:35,451 --> 00:05:37,826
Hmm, what's the line on us?

00:05:37,893 --> 00:05:39,632
On us?

00:05:39,698 --> 00:05:42,743
I'm like Tiger, man--
I'm heavily favored.

00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:45,352
Come on, give me a winner
for tomorrow.

00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:49,333
Ah... Green Bay, minus seven
and a half over Niners.

00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,276
Always go with the
better quarterback.

00:05:52,343 --> 00:05:53,280
Uh-huh.

00:05:53,347 --> 00:05:57,629
Cool.
Hey, good luck tonight, man.

00:05:57,696 --> 00:05:59,970
Thanks. You, too, Nick.

00:06:00,037 --> 00:06:01,710
I hope you get that
"trick roll" noise.

00:06:01,776 --> 00:06:03,650
You'll never crack that
in a shift, never.

00:06:03,717 --> 00:06:09,604
Yeah, well, we'll see, and I
hope the Pack wins by seven.

00:06:09,671 --> 00:06:11,478
We scrutinize the crime scene,
collect the evidence

00:06:11,545 --> 00:06:14,889
recreate what happened
without ever having been there.

00:06:14,956 --> 00:06:16,629
Pretty cool, actually.

00:06:16,696 --> 00:06:19,004
I just got out of the Academy--
I already know this.

00:06:19,071 --> 00:06:20,542
Of course you do.

00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:23,988
Then if you'll just sign these
waivers for personal injury

00:06:24,055 --> 00:06:28,035
or death while in the line of
duty, we can begin our shift.

00:06:29,775 --> 00:06:31,046
Mmm...

00:06:31,113 --> 00:06:32,351
What's the matter?

00:06:32,417 --> 00:06:34,057
Um... I'm kind of light-headed.

00:06:34,124 --> 00:06:35,897
Sit down, sit down.

00:06:35,963 --> 00:06:37,904
You're probably low
on blood sugar.

00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:39,777
I've got just the thing.

00:06:41,684 --> 00:06:43,022
Here, try one of these.

00:06:43,088 --> 00:06:47,304
No offense, but I
don't think I want
to eat anything

00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:49,210
that's been in
this office.

00:06:59,045 --> 00:07:01,286
Is there a grasshopper
in here?

00:07:03,093 --> 00:07:04,197
( <i>crunching</i> )

00:07:06,705 --> 00:07:08,646
When we get some free time, try
and catch up on your reports.

00:07:08,712 --> 00:07:10,385
I'm getting a lot of heat
from the Sheriff's Office.

00:07:10,452 --> 00:07:11,857
There I said it.

00:07:11,923 --> 00:07:13,897
Administration,
not my favorite thing.

00:07:13,964 --> 00:07:15,737
All right,
here we go.

00:07:15,804 --> 00:07:17,376
Nick Stokes, 414, trick roll.

00:07:17,443 --> 00:07:19,885
Victim found drugged and robbed
at the scene.

00:07:19,952 --> 00:07:22,862
Warrick Brown, 407,
home invasion, forced entry.

00:07:22,929 --> 00:07:26,107
Person reporting crime fired
multiple rounds at the suspect.

00:07:26,174 --> 00:07:28,650
Suspect's condition is unknown.

00:07:30,021 --> 00:07:31,894
Anyone seen Catherine Willows?

00:07:35,306 --> 00:07:37,279
Okay, give me a kiss.

00:07:37,346 --> 00:07:38,384
Mommy's got to go catch

00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:39,621
some bad guys.

00:07:39,688 --> 00:07:41,863
I'll pick her up in the morning.

00:07:41,929 --> 00:07:43,335
Bye, sis.
Bye.

00:07:43,402 --> 00:07:44,606
I love you!

00:07:47,613 --> 00:07:49,855
Brass:
<i>So your mother is</i>
<i>Lieutenant Jane Gribbs</i>

00:07:49,921 --> 00:07:51,527
from Traffic, is that right?

00:07:51,594 --> 00:07:52,634
Yes, sir.

00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,073
Well, congratulations,
Gribbs.

00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:55,578
You're the...

00:07:55,645 --> 00:07:59,123
You're the fifth person
I've been forced to hire.

00:07:59,191 --> 00:08:00,763
We're the number
two crime lab
in the country.

00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:03,890
We solve crimes
most labs render unsolvable.

00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:05,760
Now what makes you think
you belong here?

00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:08,302
Sir, with all due respect

00:08:08,369 --> 00:08:11,379
I thought the key to being
a lucid crime scene investigator

00:08:11,447 --> 00:08:14,190
was to reserve judgment
until the evidence vindicates

00:08:14,256 --> 00:08:15,627
or eliminates
assumption.

00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:17,893
You're prejudging me.

00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,933
I graduated with honors
in criminal justice at UNLV.

00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,936
Yeah, so?

00:08:22,003 --> 00:08:22,904
That's not fair.

00:08:22,971 --> 00:08:24,275
Fair? Well, you think putting

00:08:24,342 --> 00:08:25,847
a juiced-in
lieutenant's daughter

00:08:25,914 --> 00:08:27,148
on this shift is fair?

00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:28,585
You know, I've been
in the field 22 years.

00:08:28,651 --> 00:08:29,822
I've seen it all.

00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:32,395
I've seen people like you
come and go, and you know what?

00:08:32,462 --> 00:08:35,368
They're nothing
but headaches and bad press.

00:08:37,107 --> 00:08:39,048
Dismissed.

00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:42,761
Fine.

00:08:46,864 --> 00:08:48,537
Think you got through to her?

00:08:48,605 --> 00:08:50,510
You're scheduled to appear
at an autopsy at 12:30 a.m.

They're cutting up that bozo
put a hole in his chest.

00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,254
Take her with.

00:08:54,321 --> 00:08:56,094
I think every new hire
should experience

00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:58,435
an autopsy
on their first night.

She's just a little
shook up is all.

00:09:37,229 --> 00:09:39,135
Somebody want to tell us
what happened here tonight?

00:09:39,202 --> 00:09:42,481
My wife invited
her drunk friend
to stay here

00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:45,291
so he could get
back on his feet.

00:09:45,358 --> 00:09:47,833
Two weeks tops,
she says.

00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,275
That was
six months ago.

I feared for my wife
and my baby.

Let's put the
baby to bed.

That's why I took this job.

I can always tell

00:10:44,131 --> 00:10:45,670
when whitey's talking
out his ass.

00:10:45,737 --> 00:10:46,841
It's a gift.

00:10:46,907 --> 00:10:48,614
It's also your 100th.

00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:51,825
Yeah, that, too.

00:10:51,892 --> 00:10:54,434
So tonight you might say
I'm extra suspicious.

00:10:56,006 --> 00:10:58,181
Why don't you print that tread
and see how good you are?

00:11:13,334 --> 00:11:15,174
Why are you doing that?

00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:16,512
It's just procedure, sir.

00:11:16,579 --> 00:11:18,653
We just want to make sure
the shoe on the suspect

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,530
is the same shoe
that kicked down your door.

00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:23,737
Wait... Wait a minute.

00:11:23,805 --> 00:11:24,808
What's the matter?

00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:26,380
Sir, after you shot

00:11:26,447 --> 00:11:28,588
the deceased, did you move

00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:31,532
re-dress, or alter
the body in any way?

00:11:31,598 --> 00:11:33,338
No, why?

00:11:33,405 --> 00:11:34,441
Talk to me.

00:11:34,509 --> 00:11:36,851
The left shoe's
tied differently.

00:11:36,918 --> 00:11:40,029
Sir, in the six months
that the victim lived with you

00:11:40,095 --> 00:11:41,233
did you ever wear his shoes?

00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,641
No, why would I do that?

00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:46,384
You willing to sign
a statement to that effect?

00:11:46,451 --> 00:11:47,321
Sure.

00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:50,465
Sir, what happened

00:11:50,531 --> 00:11:52,673
to your pinkie toe?

00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:55,581
I tripped over a rattle.

00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:02,227
You got to breathe
through your ears, Gribbs.

00:12:02,294 --> 00:12:04,201
First dead body, ma'am?

00:12:04,268 --> 00:12:06,442
Yes, sir, but I'll be okay.

00:12:06,509 --> 00:12:08,850
To tell you the truth,
he looks fake.

00:12:08,918 --> 00:12:10,958
I hate to put a damper
on your night, Grissom

00:12:11,025 --> 00:12:14,905
but it looks like we got
ourselves a homicide after all.

00:12:14,972 --> 00:12:17,949
You see, if the victim had
extended his arms like...

00:12:18,016 --> 00:12:19,822
Here, I'll show you.
Give me your hands.

00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:22,766
And pushed the trigger
with his thumbs, like so...

00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,572
( <i>echoing gunshot</i> )

00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,312
The wound would look like this.

00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:27,517
He's right, honey.

00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:28,988
This wound's too big.

00:12:29,054 --> 00:12:32,132
This person was shot
from six to seven feet away.

00:12:32,199 --> 00:12:35,277
It's like somebody
stood over him and, bam!

00:12:35,343 --> 00:12:37,184
( <i>echoing gunshot</i> )

00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,656
Criminal homicide.

00:12:38,722 --> 00:12:41,432
Let's see what God
would have to say.

00:12:46,784 --> 00:12:47,520
Are you okay?

00:12:47,587 --> 00:12:48,691
I'm sorry, sir.

00:12:48,757 --> 00:12:50,196
I can't take the smell.

00:12:50,263 --> 00:12:52,403
Oh, God, restroom?

00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:54,612
Right down the hall
to your right.

00:12:56,953 --> 00:12:58,258
She is cute.

00:13:22,945 --> 00:13:25,554
How soon does
the Captain want
that one out?

00:13:25,621 --> 00:13:27,561
Eight hours.

00:13:27,628 --> 00:13:29,200
Whoo!

00:13:33,582 --> 00:13:35,555
( <i>gasping</i> )

00:13:35,623 --> 00:13:37,128
Help! Help me!

00:13:37,195 --> 00:13:39,469
( <i>pounding on door</i> )

00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:43,316
There were bodies.

00:13:43,383 --> 00:13:45,959
I could feel
them breathing.

00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:47,598
Oh, God!

00:13:47,665 --> 00:13:49,840
It's okay, Holly,
it's all right.

00:13:52,282 --> 00:13:54,088
You assholes!!

00:13:55,894 --> 00:13:57,735
There.

00:13:57,801 --> 00:13:58,920
Okay?

00:14:11,388 --> 00:14:12,467
What's up, fellas?

00:14:12,534 --> 00:14:14,173
We got a call
about a trick roll.

00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,812
Right there.
Room 1413.

00:14:20,529 --> 00:14:22,536
Hey.

00:14:24,609 --> 00:14:26,215
Mr. Laferty?

00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:29,494
Well, what's left
of him, anyway.

00:14:31,233 --> 00:14:34,444
I'm Nick Stokes,
with Criminalistics.

00:14:34,511 --> 00:14:36,251
You mind if I ask you
a few questions?

00:14:36,318 --> 00:14:39,329
She got everything--
my wallet, my ID...

00:14:39,395 --> 00:14:41,302
Hell, she even got
my wedding ring.

00:14:41,369 --> 00:14:43,041
Did you two
have a nightcap?

00:14:43,108 --> 00:14:45,215
You think she
could've slipped
you something?

00:14:45,283 --> 00:14:47,925
Nah, I can't drink.
I got this bum ticker.

00:14:47,992 --> 00:14:49,297
Look, Officer, I...

00:14:49,364 --> 00:14:50,902
Nick.

00:14:50,969 --> 00:14:53,344
You can call me Nick.

00:14:53,411 --> 00:14:55,519
Nick, I...

00:14:55,586 --> 00:14:57,425
I love my wife.

00:14:57,492 --> 00:14:59,500
We've been married
31 years now.

00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:01,674
I've never cheated
on her before.

00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,082
I come into town
for this convention

00:15:04,149 --> 00:15:06,324
and I'm setting
in the lounge

00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:09,334
minding my own business,
when this...

00:15:09,401 --> 00:15:12,178
sweet-smelling brunette
came up to me and...

00:15:13,615 --> 00:15:16,727
Next thing I know, she's
nibbling on my earlobe and...

00:15:16,793 --> 00:15:20,239
( <i>laughing</i> )

00:15:22,949 --> 00:15:24,788
Well, my goodness.
Look at you.

00:15:32,817 --> 00:15:36,095
For a second there,
I thought I was your age again.

00:15:36,162 --> 00:15:39,474
We've been seeing more and more
of these the past 48 hours.

00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:41,346
Let's take a look.

00:15:41,413 --> 00:15:43,353
Open your eyes
wide for me.

00:15:43,421 --> 00:15:45,227
Sunny side up.

00:15:48,606 --> 00:15:49,609
Now say "ah."

00:15:49,676 --> 00:15:51,416
Ah.

00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:52,419
Was she hot?

00:15:52,486 --> 00:15:54,192
( <i>chuckling moan</i> )

00:15:54,259 --> 00:15:55,765
Attaboy.

00:15:55,831 --> 00:15:57,972
Mr. Laferty, your
eyes look okay

00:15:58,038 --> 00:15:59,779
but I notice
some discoloration

00:15:59,845 --> 00:16:01,619
around the inside
of your lips.

00:16:01,685 --> 00:16:03,090
Have you always
had that?

00:16:03,157 --> 00:16:05,666
No. What the hell is that?

00:16:05,733 --> 00:16:07,840
I'll swab your gums

00:16:07,907 --> 00:16:10,416
see if we can find out
what made you pass out.

00:16:15,835 --> 00:16:18,912
Grissom:
<i>You know, my first robbery</i>
<i>solved was a store like this.</i>

00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:20,953
When we caught the guy,
the owner was so happy

00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,693
that he gave me a
dozen farm fresh eggs

00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:23,696
out of his cooler.

00:16:23,762 --> 00:16:25,736
You're trying
to cheer me up,
aren't you?

00:16:25,804 --> 00:16:27,777
Yes, I am.
How am I doing?

00:16:27,844 --> 00:16:29,249
Pretty good.

00:16:29,315 --> 00:16:30,587
Good.

00:16:30,654 --> 00:16:33,029
Okay, look, this was
a routine robbery.

00:16:33,096 --> 00:16:35,304
Dust for prints,
check the videotape

00:16:35,371 --> 00:16:36,808
take lots of fun photos.

00:16:36,876 --> 00:16:39,518
I'll be back in
about an hour
to pick you up.

00:16:39,585 --> 00:16:41,793
Okay.

00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,700
If you get done early

00:16:43,767 --> 00:16:45,707
use channel seven
on your walkie.

00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:53,735
What's up?

00:16:53,802 --> 00:16:55,207
Hey, rookie.

00:16:55,274 --> 00:16:57,281
Hair fibers
from the home invasion.

00:16:57,348 --> 00:16:58,753
Take a look.

00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,124
Tell me what you see.

00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,179
I see a lot of things.

00:17:06,246 --> 00:17:08,019
Look at the end
of the follicles.

00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:11,832
Oh, yeah, you know,
I see, like

00:17:11,899 --> 00:17:14,575
little tiny seeds
or sacs or something.

00:17:14,642 --> 00:17:16,381
That's pulp
when the human hair

00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:17,787
is yanked out
like this.

00:17:17,853 --> 00:17:19,794
Ow! Damn, man.

00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,734
Look, you see
the seeds?

00:17:21,801 --> 00:17:23,741
Hair only comes
out in that form

00:17:23,808 --> 00:17:25,480
when it's yanked
or pulled

00:17:25,548 --> 00:17:27,120
signifying a struggle.

00:17:27,187 --> 00:17:29,127
You know what?
I got to go.

00:17:29,194 --> 00:17:31,033
Tell Grissom,
when he gets back

00:17:31,101 --> 00:17:33,542
I went to Homicide
to do a follow-up
on the husband.

00:17:33,609 --> 00:17:34,646
Peace.

00:17:34,713 --> 00:17:35,649
Yeah.

00:17:35,716 --> 00:17:38,827
Now, how long
is this gonna take?

00:17:38,894 --> 00:17:42,105
I'm losing business
because of you.

00:17:42,173 --> 00:17:43,711
Ma'am, I told you,
if you let them in

00:17:43,779 --> 00:17:45,050
it will contaminate
the scene.

00:17:45,116 --> 00:17:46,454
Oh, contaminate, my ass!

00:17:46,522 --> 00:17:48,696
What the hell
difference does it make?

00:17:48,762 --> 00:17:50,201
You ain't
gonna catch 'em.

00:17:50,268 --> 00:17:52,476
You never do.

00:17:52,543 --> 00:17:54,717
Sir, I'm on your side.

00:17:54,783 --> 00:17:57,193
I just want
to clear you.

00:17:57,259 --> 00:17:59,165
Then clear me.
I already told
you everything.

00:17:59,233 --> 00:18:00,471
I understand that.

00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:02,276
The evidence tells us
something different.

00:18:02,344 --> 00:18:05,121
So I'm going
to ask you again,
just one more time--

00:18:05,187 --> 00:18:08,599
before you shot
the deceased

00:18:08,665 --> 00:18:09,803
did a struggle ensue?

00:18:09,871 --> 00:18:11,543
( <i>woman shrieks</i> )

00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:12,346
I've got a gun.

00:18:13,483 --> 00:18:14,788
Woman:
What are you doing?

00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:17,965
( <i>shrieking</i> )

( <i>gunshots</i> )

00:18:18,935 --> 00:18:20,340
Call 911.

( <i>child crying</i> )

00:18:29,707 --> 00:18:33,688
I must've tied
the laces wrong.

00:18:33,754 --> 00:18:37,300
I'm sorry, I...

00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:39,174
I know I should've
told you earlier but...

00:18:39,241 --> 00:18:41,181
I was nervous.

00:18:41,248 --> 00:18:43,589
I mean...

00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:47,402
I took a man's life here.

00:18:49,777 --> 00:18:52,220
You don't believe me,
do you?

00:18:53,825 --> 00:18:56,267
This is Holly Gribbs
requesting backup

00:18:56,334 --> 00:18:58,274
at Junk's on West Owens,
over.

00:18:58,341 --> 00:19:00,883
This is Catherine Willows.
Are you in danger?

00:19:00,951 --> 00:19:03,091
Uh, we're getting there.

00:19:03,158 --> 00:19:05,265
This is my popsicle stand--
I'll defend it

00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,440
to the hilt
if I have to!

00:19:07,506 --> 00:19:09,848
So, this is it, huh?

00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:11,922
The $8,000 Q-Tip.

00:19:11,989 --> 00:19:14,197
Well, you're the chemist.

00:19:14,264 --> 00:19:16,672
I just need to know <i>what</i>
knocked the old man out.

00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:19,951
In 20 seconds, this'll give us
a complete chemical breakdown

00:19:20,018 --> 00:19:21,757
right down
to the atom.

00:19:21,823 --> 00:19:24,400
But I'm going to
warn you, though

00:19:24,466 --> 00:19:26,975
These mouth swabs
don't always read.

00:19:27,043 --> 00:19:29,418
Vaginal swabs,
no problem.

00:19:29,484 --> 00:19:32,227
Anal swabs-- money.

00:19:32,294 --> 00:19:33,532
Anal swabs?

00:19:33,598 --> 00:19:34,602
Anal swabs.

00:19:34,669 --> 00:19:38,616
Ouch.

Dude, you get NFL-2K
for Dreamcast?

00:19:47,514 --> 00:19:49,655
Yeah. Bought it
the day it came out.

00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:52,097
Those graphics are killer,
aren't they?

00:19:52,164 --> 00:19:53,468
My team's
the Falcons.

00:19:53,535 --> 00:19:54,907
Who do you use?

00:19:54,974 --> 00:19:56,346
Randy Moss.

It didn't take,
did it?

00:20:04,206 --> 00:20:06,414
A hint of saliva;
some denture adhesive...

00:20:06,481 --> 00:20:08,120
That's it.

00:20:08,187 --> 00:20:11,399
Sorry, man.

00:20:12,971 --> 00:20:14,476
All right, put the gun down.

00:20:14,543 --> 00:20:15,680
What?

00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:17,921
We're getting robbed again now?

00:20:17,988 --> 00:20:18,992
Everything okay here?

00:20:19,059 --> 00:20:20,062
Yes, ma'am.

00:20:21,668 --> 00:20:23,842
Control, Junk's
is a Code Four.

00:20:23,909 --> 00:20:25,615
Officer:
Copy that.

00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:26,619
You the new girl?

00:20:26,685 --> 00:20:28,759
Yeah. Hi, I'm
Holly Gribbs.

00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:30,533
Thanks.
I'm Catherine Willows.

00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:31,536
And I'm Lesley Stahl.

00:20:31,603 --> 00:20:33,142
Look, let's forget
the formalities.

00:20:33,209 --> 00:20:35,717
Which one of you people's
gonna clean my counter here?

00:20:35,784 --> 00:20:37,156
Let me tell you
something, lady--

00:20:37,223 --> 00:20:39,130
if you don't care
about catching the suspect

00:20:39,197 --> 00:20:40,267
neither do we.

00:20:40,334 --> 00:20:41,270
We're out of here.

00:20:41,337 --> 00:20:43,712
You can pick your
gun up tomorrow.

00:20:43,779 --> 00:20:45,218
You can do that?

00:20:45,284 --> 00:20:47,291
No.

00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,005
Ow!

00:20:53,547 --> 00:20:55,487
Damn!

00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:56,791
Blunt force
trauma case.

00:20:56,858 --> 00:20:58,498
Bermuda Hills Country Club.

00:20:58,565 --> 00:21:00,572
Pregnant wife
caught her husband

00:21:00,639 --> 00:21:02,211
in bed with
another girl.

00:21:02,278 --> 00:21:05,021
What do you think?
Malicious intent?

00:21:05,087 --> 00:21:06,593
Little bit, yeah.
( <i>camera clicks</i> )

00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,098
How's it coming?

00:21:08,165 --> 00:21:09,503
It's coming.

00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:13,150
Whose blood
is that?

00:21:13,217 --> 00:21:14,253
The new girl's.

00:21:14,321 --> 00:21:15,658
Would you like to donate?

00:21:15,725 --> 00:21:17,431
Hell, no.

00:21:17,498 --> 00:21:19,907
How'd the follow-up
go with the husband?

00:21:19,974 --> 00:21:22,114
Boe tells me
you were onto something.

00:21:22,181 --> 00:21:23,653
The story's
changed a bit.

00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,325
Now he says
there <i>was</i> a struggle.

00:21:25,393 --> 00:21:28,102
Said he stepped on his shoe
while they were fighting.

00:21:28,169 --> 00:21:29,674
You believe him?

00:21:29,742 --> 00:21:30,678
At first, no

00:21:30,745 --> 00:21:33,253
but now...

00:21:33,321 --> 00:21:35,260
Hell, I don't know
what to think.

00:21:35,328 --> 00:21:37,302
You ever see the movie
<i>The Exorcist?</i>

00:21:37,368 --> 00:21:39,877
Yeah.

00:21:39,943 --> 00:21:41,784
The old priest
and Father Karras

00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:43,791
are about to exorcise
the demon.

00:21:43,857 --> 00:21:45,798
Father Karras explains

00:21:45,864 --> 00:21:48,006
that he's recorded
the little girl's voice

00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:49,845
and he's broken
down the spirit

00:21:49,912 --> 00:21:51,885
into three distinct
personalities.

00:21:51,953 --> 00:21:55,331
But the old priest
quickly corrects him--

00:21:55,398 --> 00:21:58,442
"There is only one."

00:21:58,509 --> 00:22:00,717
Forget about the
husband, Warrick.

00:22:00,784 --> 00:22:02,657
Forget about
the assumptions.

00:22:02,724 --> 00:22:04,530
Forget about
your promotion.

00:22:04,598 --> 00:22:06,905
These things will
only confuse you.

00:22:06,973 --> 00:22:09,381
Concentrate on what cannot lie--

00:22:09,448 --> 00:22:11,287
the evidence.

00:22:11,355 --> 00:22:14,030
Follow...

00:22:14,098 --> 00:22:16,840
the reason we're having
this conversation.

00:22:18,747 --> 00:22:21,022
Follow the shoe.

00:22:38,383 --> 00:22:40,638
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:22:59,292 --> 00:23:00,392
Well, I'll be damned.

00:23:08,957 --> 00:23:11,215
Tripped over
a rattle, my ass.

00:23:13,687 --> 00:23:15,126
Remember this
from your suicide case?

00:23:15,192 --> 00:23:17,969
Minute I pulled it,
I knew something
wasn't right.

00:23:18,036 --> 00:23:19,775
The impression's
perfect--

00:23:19,842 --> 00:23:21,347
maybe too perfect.

00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,453
Take a gander.

00:23:29,801 --> 00:23:32,268
What are those red particles?

00:23:32,334 --> 00:23:33,807
Latex flakes.

00:23:33,873 --> 00:23:35,312
From what?

00:23:35,379 --> 00:23:36,984
Protective
gloves, maybe

00:23:37,051 --> 00:23:39,995
but the way I figure it,
this son of a bitch is smart--

00:23:40,062 --> 00:23:42,002
probably planted
the damn prints.

00:23:42,069 --> 00:23:44,544
So on a hunch,
I chemically tested the flakes.

00:23:44,611 --> 00:23:46,551
Guess what it
was laced with?

00:23:46,618 --> 00:23:47,622
Lecithin.

00:23:47,689 --> 00:23:48,625
That chemical's found

00:23:48,693 --> 00:23:49,729
in cooking spray

00:23:49,796 --> 00:23:51,068
isn't it?

00:23:51,135 --> 00:23:53,610
If latex rubber
and cooking spray

00:23:53,676 --> 00:23:57,222
went on a blind date,
how would the night end?

00:23:57,289 --> 00:23:58,661
A lot better than ours did.

00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:02,340
I know,
Pink Floyd's not your thing.

00:24:02,745 --> 00:24:03,849
I have on cowboy boots.

00:24:03,916 --> 00:24:05,187
I work in a lab.

00:24:05,254 --> 00:24:07,295
What makes you think
<i>Dark Side of the Moon</i>

00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:11,033
synched to <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>
is going to warm my damn barn?

00:24:11,099 --> 00:24:13,004
I just thought
it'd be something different.

00:24:13,071 --> 00:24:14,710
You want to
be different?

00:24:14,776 --> 00:24:17,085
Pin me up against a wall;
lay one on me like you mean it.

00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:22,872
You're slacking, pal.

00:24:29,027 --> 00:24:30,449
How long till
we get a hit?

00:24:30,516 --> 00:24:32,523
It could be four minutes,
could be four days

00:24:32,589 --> 00:24:35,360
but you can bet your ass
she'll give you something.

00:24:35,428 --> 00:24:37,267
She always does.

00:24:38,067 --> 00:24:40,275
Pin you against a wall?

00:24:44,417 --> 00:24:48,933
Look, um, I got
to be honest.

00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,743
This isn't me.

00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:55,021
I was pushed into it by my mom.

00:24:55,088 --> 00:24:57,817
She's a lieutenant in Traffic.

00:24:57,884 --> 00:25:01,062
She's never going
to get out of Traffic. so, um--

00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:04,618
I'm fulfilling
her dreams, not mine.

00:25:04,846 --> 00:25:06,953
I can sit here
and I can baby you

00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:09,028
and I can tell you to quit

00:25:09,095 --> 00:25:12,475
but I'm not going to do that,
because I really love my job.

00:25:12,476 --> 00:25:14,316
We're just
a bunch of kids

00:25:14,383 --> 00:25:16,932
that are getting <i>paid</i>
to work on puzzles.

00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,776
Sometimes there's a piece
that's missing.

00:25:19,843 --> 00:25:22,218
Sometimes we solve it
in one night.

00:25:23,114 --> 00:25:25,054
So you think I should stick
with it?

00:25:25,121 --> 00:25:27,362
Stick with it?

00:25:27,429 --> 00:25:29,068
The cops?

00:25:29,699 --> 00:25:31,136
Forget it.

00:25:31,204 --> 00:25:34,181
They wouldn't know fingerprints
from paw prints

00:25:34,248 --> 00:25:36,154
and the detectives...

00:25:36,221 --> 00:25:37,995
chase the lie.

00:25:38,061 --> 00:25:40,370
We solve. We restore
peace of mind

00:25:40,436 --> 00:25:44,149
and when you're a victim,
that's everything.

00:25:45,104 --> 00:25:47,075
Stick with it.

00:25:47,142 --> 00:25:49,115
At least
until you solve your first

00:25:49,182 --> 00:25:52,260
and if after that you don't feel
like King Kong on cocaine...

00:25:52,326 --> 00:25:54,835
then you can quit

00:25:54,902 --> 00:25:57,043
but if you stay with it

00:25:57,110 --> 00:26:00,556
my hand to God,
you will never regret it.

00:26:00,622 --> 00:26:04,335
Dispatcher:
Catherine Willows,
cut your lunch short.

00:26:04,402 --> 00:26:06,108
You got a 428.

00:26:06,175 --> 00:26:09,320
Copy.

00:26:11,398 --> 00:26:13,568
Brass:
If you want me to call
Judge Cohen at 4:00 in the morning

00:26:13,635 --> 00:26:16,010
you'd better bring me something
more than a damn toenail.

00:26:16,077 --> 00:26:17,682
Captain, you've got
to make that call.

00:26:17,749 --> 00:26:18,987
If you don't, he'll walk.

00:26:19,053 --> 00:26:20,960
And what do you got?
Hair fibers. Big deal.

00:26:21,027 --> 00:26:23,402
So there was a struggle.
I mean, who gives a corn cob?

00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:25,276
The guy was protecting
his wife and kid.

00:26:25,342 --> 00:26:26,280
I've got the toenail.

00:26:26,346 --> 00:26:27,450
If I can get a warrant

00:26:27,517 --> 00:26:29,223
and match the husband's shaving
to his toe

00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:31,163
I can prove
that the suspect's foot

00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,501
was inside the victim's shoe.

00:26:32,569 --> 00:26:34,662
That alone will establish it was murder.

00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:36,315
The guy lived there, Warrick.
Maybe he put on

00:26:36,381 --> 00:26:38,590
the victim's sneaker and fetched
the paper one morning.

00:26:38,656 --> 00:26:42,048
I have a sworn statement stating
he never wore the victim's shoe.

00:26:42,115 --> 00:26:43,952
You don't even know
the toenail was the vic's.

00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,389
It can't be.
He was wearing socks.

00:26:45,455 --> 00:26:46,091
Not good enough.

00:26:46,158 --> 00:26:46,726
Not good enough?

00:26:46,793 --> 00:26:48,867
Look, I said no, Brown,
damn it!

00:26:49,567 --> 00:26:50,272
( <i>phone rings</i> )

00:26:50,338 --> 00:26:52,245
Hey, we're not
done, Warrick.

00:26:52,312 --> 00:26:53,517
You stay right there.

00:26:54,278 --> 00:26:55,884
Criminalistics, Brass.

00:26:55,951 --> 00:26:58,460
Grissom:
<i>We've got a name on the</i>
<i>suicide case, sir. He's local.</i>

00:26:58,526 --> 00:26:59,631
He's local, good.

00:26:59,697 --> 00:27:01,236
I'll phone the judge
for a warrant.

00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:05,451
Hey, Warrick,
I guess we're all done now.

00:27:05,518 --> 00:27:07,793
Hey, do you mind closing
the door behind you?

00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,164
I got to make
an important call.

00:27:09,231 --> 00:27:12,843
We'll talk about your
little foot fetish later.

00:27:12,911 --> 00:27:14,985
Judge Cohen, please.

00:27:16,668 --> 00:27:18,373
Officer:
A white female,
mid-20s.

00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,113
Said she passed out
behind the wheel.

00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,953
Thought you might want
to check it out.

00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:24,562
All right. Thanks, brother.

00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:27,796
Hi.

00:27:27,863 --> 00:27:29,870
Nick Stokes,
Criminalistics.

00:27:29,938 --> 00:27:31,209
Mind if I take a look?

00:27:31,275 --> 00:27:32,380
I don't know what happened.

00:27:32,446 --> 00:27:33,383
I remember this song

00:27:33,449 --> 00:27:34,888
that was playing
on the radio.

00:27:34,955 --> 00:27:38,233
I just don't remember
passing out.

00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,106
Say "ahhh..."

00:27:40,173 --> 00:27:43,117
What?

00:27:43,184 --> 00:27:44,288
You know, ahhh...

00:27:44,355 --> 00:27:45,559
Ahhh...

00:27:49,673 --> 00:27:51,580
Ahhh...

00:27:54,156 --> 00:27:56,698
No discoloration.

00:27:58,805 --> 00:28:02,151
I don't see
anything criminal here.

00:28:02,218 --> 00:28:04,158
Take her to
the hospital

00:28:04,225 --> 00:28:06,132
have her checked out.

00:28:10,514 --> 00:28:14,996
Well, might as well roll the
dice; take that ass-whooping.

00:28:22,054 --> 00:28:23,794
( <i>siren whooping</i> )

00:28:24,831 --> 00:28:26,871
Police!

00:28:26,939 --> 00:28:28,611
Put your hands
on top of your head

00:28:28,678 --> 00:28:29,982
and walk backwards
towards me.

00:28:30,049 --> 00:28:31,287
I'm ID. Check the badge.

00:28:31,354 --> 00:28:32,459
I'm from Criminalistics.

00:28:32,527 --> 00:28:34,031
Keep your mouth shut
and follow

00:28:34,099 --> 00:28:36,708
my instructions.
Now get down
on your knees.

00:28:36,775 --> 00:28:38,983
I won't get down on my knees
for anybody. You can shoot me.

00:28:39,049 --> 00:28:42,151
I said get down on your knees!

00:28:42,218 --> 00:28:43,054
Hey!

00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:45,061
What the hell
are you doing?

00:28:45,128 --> 00:28:47,136
That's Warrick Brown from ID.

00:28:47,203 --> 00:28:48,340
Put those guns away.

00:28:48,407 --> 00:28:50,916
Sorry, Judge,
we got a call
from a neighbor

00:28:50,982 --> 00:28:52,889
about a black man
outside your house.

00:28:52,956 --> 00:28:54,060
We responded.

00:28:54,127 --> 00:28:55,666
All right,
you caught him.

00:28:55,732 --> 00:28:57,238
Congratulations.

00:28:57,305 --> 00:29:01,285
Clear out of here
before you wake the neighbors.

00:29:01,352 --> 00:29:03,627
Yes, sir.

00:29:03,694 --> 00:29:05,434
Dispatch, please be advised

00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:09,882
Judge Cohen's residence,
a Code 4: false alarm.

00:29:09,949 --> 00:29:11,421
Brown, what the hell
are you doing?

00:29:11,488 --> 00:29:12,759
I'm sorry, Judge.

00:29:12,826 --> 00:29:14,867
Captain Brass wouldn't call you
for a search warrant.

00:29:14,934 --> 00:29:16,907
I got a whopper on the line
with a 100-pound test.

00:29:16,974 --> 00:29:19,684
You got a winner for me?

00:29:19,751 --> 00:29:22,762
I'll make it worth your while,
you give me a name.

00:29:22,828 --> 00:29:24,467
Favre.

00:29:24,534 --> 00:29:27,946
Oh, I knew it. Listen, kid,
I'll make a deal with you.

00:29:28,013 --> 00:29:30,388
You put $5,000 down
on the Pack for me

00:29:30,455 --> 00:29:32,697
I'll give you a blank warrant.

00:29:32,763 --> 00:29:34,737
All I ask
is that you have

00:29:34,804 --> 00:29:37,380
the ticket in my chambers
before kickoff.

00:29:37,447 --> 00:29:40,390
You do that, I'll square it
with your Captain.

00:29:40,457 --> 00:29:42,364
No problem, Judge.

00:29:43,501 --> 00:29:46,444
A staged suicide.

00:29:46,512 --> 00:29:48,418
You're kidding, right?

00:29:49,388 --> 00:29:50,993
I swear on my kids

00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:54,338
I've never seen that
man before in my life.

00:29:54,406 --> 00:29:55,470
Then how the hell

00:29:55,537 --> 00:29:57,375
did your fingerprints
wind up at the scene?

00:29:57,442 --> 00:29:59,449
We talked to the family.
The deceased

00:29:59,516 --> 00:30:01,389
didn't even know
any Paul Millanders.

00:30:02,755 --> 00:30:04,032
Oh, I...

00:30:04,099 --> 00:30:05,771
Hi, Sergeant.

00:30:05,838 --> 00:30:08,146
Would you mind if I, uh...?

00:30:08,213 --> 00:30:09,552
Oh, you want
a whack at him, Grissom

00:30:09,619 --> 00:30:11,124
be my guest.

00:30:12,613 --> 00:30:16,225
Hi, Mr. Millander,
my name's Gil Grissom.

00:30:16,292 --> 00:30:17,760
I work in Criminalistics.

00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,465
May I ask you a few questions?

00:30:19,532 --> 00:30:20,736
Sure.

00:30:20,803 --> 00:30:22,208
Do you have any hobbies?

00:30:22,275 --> 00:30:24,885
Make model airplanes,
make toys

00:30:24,951 --> 00:30:27,393
wind chimes for the backyard,
that sort of thing?

00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:30,839
No, why?

00:30:30,906 --> 00:30:35,254
Well, we found some particles
of latex on your thumbprint.

00:30:35,321 --> 00:30:38,298
Would you have any reason
to have access

00:30:38,366 --> 00:30:40,138
to that particular
substance?

00:30:40,205 --> 00:30:42,178
Well, yeah.

00:30:42,245 --> 00:30:45,925
Yeah, sure. At-at my job.

00:30:57,697 --> 00:31:00,808
Wow, you made all these?

00:31:00,874 --> 00:31:03,249
Yes, sir,
everything
from scratch.

00:31:03,317 --> 00:31:08,101
We mold, carve, shape,
paint and authenticate.

00:31:08,167 --> 00:31:10,108
Excellent work.

00:31:10,174 --> 00:31:11,981
These seem very real.

00:31:12,048 --> 00:31:13,486
Thanks.

00:31:13,552 --> 00:31:16,463
You ever make any rubber hands?

00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:19,240
Sure we do, uh...

00:31:24,223 --> 00:31:27,168
This is our best seller
right here.

00:31:27,234 --> 00:31:29,543
Sold 10,000 of those units

00:31:29,609 --> 00:31:33,925
last Halloween.
Even used my own
hand for the mold.

00:31:33,991 --> 00:31:35,932
These are your prints.

00:31:35,998 --> 00:31:38,675
Yeah, why? What does that mean?

00:31:38,741 --> 00:31:40,247
It means you're free to go.

00:31:40,314 --> 00:31:41,451
He's not the guy.

00:31:41,518 --> 00:31:43,023
Grissom, are you sure?

00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:45,967
This explains the latex
and the lecithin.

00:31:46,034 --> 00:31:48,543
<i>You need oil to make a print.</i>

00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:51,388
Anyone who purchased
one of these hands could be the killer

00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:56,309
and what's worse,
he's proficient in forensics.

00:31:59,517 --> 00:32:01,187
Hey, Dr. Leever!

00:32:01,254 --> 00:32:03,228
Hey, what's up, man?
I got your page.

00:32:03,294 --> 00:32:05,235
Have you had any
trick rolls lately?

00:32:05,301 --> 00:32:06,367
A ton of 'em. Why?

00:32:06,433 --> 00:32:09,040
I've had six pros
come through the ER in the past two nights

00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,779
all with two distinct
similarities.

00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:13,455
Every girl has
been mysteriously
knocked unconscious

00:32:13,522 --> 00:32:15,329
and we found some
skin discoloration.

00:32:15,396 --> 00:32:17,328
Skin discoloration?

00:32:17,395 --> 00:32:18,866
Where? Their lips?

00:32:18,934 --> 00:32:20,840
No, their nipples.

00:32:24,546 --> 00:32:25,917
We meet again...

00:32:25,984 --> 00:32:27,921
May I see your
discoloration?

00:32:27,989 --> 00:32:29,828
You wanna give me
20 bucks?

00:32:29,894 --> 00:32:31,032
You wanna do time?

00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:46,456
You know, I just came
from a trick roll downtown.

00:32:46,522 --> 00:32:48,965
The victim's mouth
had similar blotching.

00:32:49,032 --> 00:32:51,407
Chances are, whatever
he ingested orally

00:32:51,474 --> 00:32:53,447
you absorbed through
your nipples

00:32:53,514 --> 00:32:55,689
knocking you both out.

00:32:55,755 --> 00:32:58,832
So I'll give you a choice.

00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:02,513
You give back the old man
his belongings

00:33:02,579 --> 00:33:04,419
you tell me what
you girls are using

00:33:04,486 --> 00:33:05,992
and I won't have
you charged

00:33:06,058 --> 00:33:07,764
with attempted murder.

00:33:07,831 --> 00:33:09,571
Which is it?

00:33:18,569 --> 00:33:19,907
Eyedrops?

00:33:19,974 --> 00:33:22,382
No, it's scopolamine.

00:33:22,449 --> 00:33:24,223
It's a chemical used
for motion sickness.

00:33:24,289 --> 00:33:25,627
This eyedrop bottle's a front.

00:33:25,694 --> 00:33:28,638
One drop of this stuff
and she's out cold.

00:34:01,621 --> 00:34:03,259
We're ruling out
suicide.

00:34:03,326 --> 00:34:04,798
The evidence leads us

00:34:04,865 --> 00:34:07,341
to believe that it was
in fact a homicide.

00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:11,823
Then he was murdered?

00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:13,262
I believe so.

00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,688
You know...

00:34:20,754 --> 00:34:22,594
this may sound funny

00:34:22,661 --> 00:34:24,969
but I feel better knowing

00:34:25,036 --> 00:34:28,047
that he didn't take
his own life.

00:34:28,114 --> 00:34:30,790
To me that would
never sit right.

00:34:30,857 --> 00:34:32,864
He was such a good man...

00:34:32,931 --> 00:34:35,072
We'll find him,
Ms. Harmon.

00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:37,012
I promise you.

00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:39,421
There is always a clue.

00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:41,561
I'll find him.

00:34:45,575 --> 00:34:46,846
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

00:34:46,914 --> 00:34:48,017
Nurse, excuse me.

00:34:48,084 --> 00:34:50,359
I'm Catherine Willows
from Criminalistics

00:34:50,426 --> 00:34:51,931
and I'm here for the 428.

00:34:56,448 --> 00:34:58,253
Hi, Laura.

00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,830
I'm Catherine.

00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:07,185
How you doin', kiddo?

00:35:07,252 --> 00:35:09,024
What's that?

00:35:09,092 --> 00:35:12,002
Well, that is a camera.

00:35:12,069 --> 00:35:14,812
I'm gonna take
a few photographs.

00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:19,294
Before I do that, though,
could you do me a favor?

00:35:21,602 --> 00:35:23,376
Could you take a look
at this drawing

00:35:23,442 --> 00:35:27,088
and point out to me...

00:35:27,155 --> 00:35:29,430
where he touched you?

00:35:33,612 --> 00:35:35,384
( <i>whispers</i> ):
Can you just show me?

00:35:42,844 --> 00:35:45,554
Can you hold
my dolly for me?

00:35:45,621 --> 00:35:48,229
I'd love to.

00:35:48,297 --> 00:35:49,936
Not just hold her.

00:35:50,003 --> 00:35:52,612
Take her away to your house.

00:35:52,679 --> 00:35:55,756
To my house? Why?

00:35:55,823 --> 00:35:58,968
Because I don't want the same
thing that happened to me

00:35:59,035 --> 00:36:00,306
to happen to dolly.

00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:10,341
It's okay.

00:36:13,586 --> 00:36:15,793
It's gonna be okay, sweetheart.

00:36:17,834 --> 00:36:19,239
You're off the case.

00:36:19,306 --> 00:36:20,878
What? Why?

00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:22,818
Why? you deliberately went
over my head, Brown.

00:36:22,885 --> 00:36:24,056
The phone call from the judge

00:36:24,123 --> 00:36:25,595
saved your job,
but not your ass!

00:36:25,662 --> 00:36:26,966
I want you
shadowing Gribbs.

00:36:27,033 --> 00:36:28,203
A robbery just came in.

00:36:28,271 --> 00:36:29,642
You can't do that.
Me and Nick are tied!

00:36:29,709 --> 00:36:31,148
Tough!

00:36:31,214 --> 00:36:34,459
Grissom! Have Warrick shadow
Gribbs for the next three weeks

00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:37,135
or until Nickie makes his
hundredth, whatever comes first.

00:36:37,202 --> 00:36:38,708
I hate your ass, you know that?

00:36:38,774 --> 00:36:39,778
People walk every day

00:36:39,845 --> 00:36:41,484
because of you-- every day!

00:36:41,551 --> 00:36:43,358
That's enough, Warrick.
Let's go!

00:36:43,424 --> 00:36:44,361
Damn it, Gris.

00:36:44,427 --> 00:36:45,365
I had his ass too!

00:36:45,431 --> 00:36:46,535
Yes, you had him

00:36:46,602 --> 00:36:49,010
and the minute you started
thinking about yourself

00:36:49,077 --> 00:36:50,716
instead of the case,
you lost him.

00:36:50,783 --> 00:36:52,858
There is no room
for subjectivity

00:36:52,924 --> 00:36:54,663
in this department,
Warrick.

00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:57,608
You know that we handle
each case objectively

without presupposition
regardless of race, color,
creed, or bubble gum flavor.

00:37:02,759 --> 00:37:04,699
Okay?

00:37:17,912 --> 00:37:19,418
Let's go.

Make sure you take
plenty of photographs...

Photographs. Be thorough.
Don't worry.

00:37:38,485 --> 00:37:39,856

from Mr. Grissom.

Good. Look, I gotta
run an errand.

on your own?

00:38:05,848 --> 00:38:07,788
How can I help you?

00:38:07,855 --> 00:38:09,427
I need to give you a pedicure.

00:38:09,494 --> 00:38:10,766
Come again?

00:38:10,832 --> 00:38:13,006
I have a warrant
for your toenails.

00:38:14,244 --> 00:38:15,481
A warrant?

00:38:15,549 --> 00:38:18,526
What? Am I a suspect?

00:38:19,931 --> 00:38:21,537
I already gave you
a sworn statement.

00:38:21,603 --> 00:38:24,179
A statement's just
a public record of your version.

00:38:24,246 --> 00:38:25,785
We still need proof.

00:38:30,201 --> 00:38:34,047
Well, I'd love to help you,
but I already cut them.

00:38:34,115 --> 00:38:36,122
May I see where you discarded
the clippings?

00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:38,062
I flushed them down the toilet.

00:38:38,129 --> 00:38:40,437
May I see your toilet?

00:39:06,997 --> 00:39:09,238
I'll be right back.

had a rough night.

to tell you
how much I love you.

00:40:17,646 --> 00:40:20,623
I know, Mommy.
I love you, too.

No, striation.

00:40:38,486 --> 00:40:39,790
Whenever two objects are broken

00:40:39,857 --> 00:40:41,363
there occurs
what we call striae--

00:40:41,429 --> 00:40:44,039
two unique connecting points.

00:40:44,106 --> 00:40:46,246
If I can match the nail
in the sneaker

00:40:46,314 --> 00:40:48,086
to the suspect's clippings...

00:40:51,867 --> 00:40:52,970
Alcatraz!

00:40:53,038 --> 00:40:54,843
The brother was right,
wasn't he?!

00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:55,646
Uh-huh!

00:40:55,713 --> 00:40:58,657
Yeah!

00:40:58,724 --> 00:41:00,564
Careful, Boe,
you'll hurt your back.

00:41:05,614 --> 00:41:07,923
What's up, man?

00:41:07,989 --> 00:41:09,730
Gimme Packers.
One second...

00:41:09,796 --> 00:41:12,105
Man ( <i>over radio</i> ):
Warrick, come in.

00:41:12,171 --> 00:41:14,345
This is Warrick. Go ahead.

00:41:14,413 --> 00:41:16,185
It's Grissom. We got him.

00:41:16,252 --> 00:41:18,627
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, yeah!

00:41:18,694 --> 00:41:20,133
I'll be right there.

00:41:20,199 --> 00:41:21,973
Who do you want now?

00:41:22,039 --> 00:41:24,381
Gimmie Niners for five dimes.

00:41:34,918 --> 00:41:36,858
( <i>man yelling outside</i> ):
Open up!

00:41:36,925 --> 00:41:38,197
Open the door...

00:41:38,263 --> 00:41:40,337
What are you gonna do?
Don't ask questions.

00:41:40,404 --> 00:41:41,307
Just open the door.

00:41:41,374 --> 00:41:44,251
You son of a bitch!

00:41:44,318 --> 00:41:47,295
( <i>three gunshots</i> )

00:41:47,362 --> 00:41:49,637
( <i>baby crying in background</i> )

00:42:06,563 --> 00:42:09,406
Call 911.

00:42:09,473 --> 00:42:11,480
( <i>echoing</i> ):
Do it!

00:42:27,536 --> 00:42:30,849
Hey, weren't you supposed
to be shadowing Holly?

00:42:30,916 --> 00:42:32,554
Oh, she's cool.

00:42:32,621 --> 00:42:34,628
She's doing prints
on that 407.

00:42:34,695 --> 00:42:36,502
There's an officer there.

00:42:36,568 --> 00:42:38,107
I'm out.

00:42:54,130 --> 00:42:55,870
Excuse me, ma'am.

00:42:58,011 --> 00:43:00,687
Hi. Uh... can I help you?

00:43:00,754 --> 00:43:03,296
I'm the neighbor
from across the way

00:43:03,363 --> 00:43:05,537
and I just saw
a cop car leave.

00:43:05,604 --> 00:43:06,976
Is everything okay?

00:43:07,043 --> 00:43:09,952
Yeah, we had a robbery,
but everything's fine.

00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,859
Oh, okay.

00:43:19,453 --> 00:43:21,393
( <i>knocking</i> )

00:43:21,461 --> 00:43:23,266
Room service.

00:43:23,333 --> 00:43:25,742
You're kidding me.

00:43:30,191 --> 00:43:33,101
My stuff!

00:43:33,168 --> 00:43:34,807
You found my stuff!

00:43:34,874 --> 00:43:38,253
Yeah, yeah, your wallet,
your cash, credit cards...

00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:39,590
wedding ring...

00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:41,899
Oh, thank God.

00:43:41,965 --> 00:43:44,174
Okay, next time
you wanna take a shot

00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,979
go to the dice table.

00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:47,886
At least if you crap out,
you can go home broke

00:43:47,953 --> 00:43:50,429
instead of busted,
you know what I mean?

00:43:50,496 --> 00:43:52,971
I sure do.

00:43:53,038 --> 00:43:54,643
Thank you.

00:43:54,711 --> 00:43:56,283
Congratulations, Nickie my boy.

00:43:56,350 --> 00:43:57,621
You are now a C.S.I.
Level III.

00:43:57,688 --> 00:43:58,892
Whoo!

00:43:58,959 --> 00:44:00,163
( <i>clapping</i> )

00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:01,702
Good job, Nick.

00:44:01,768 --> 00:44:03,642
Thanks.
Uh, hey, Warrick, listen

00:44:03,709 --> 00:44:06,218
I heard about the whole thing
with the shoe and...

00:44:06,285 --> 00:44:07,891
Forget it, man.
It's all you.

00:44:07,957 --> 00:44:09,128
Thanks.

00:44:09,195 --> 00:44:11,235
Let's get some breakfast.
It's on me!

00:44:11,302 --> 00:44:12,841
Sorry to break up your party

00:44:12,909 --> 00:44:15,049
but I need grave
to pull a double.

00:44:15,116 --> 00:44:17,591
Holly Gribbs has been shot.

00:44:17,659 --> 00:44:19,766
She's in surgery now.

00:44:19,832 --> 00:44:23,406
Apparently the suspect
returned to the scene.

00:44:25,508 --> 00:44:27,443
They don't think
she's gonna make it.

00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:29,078
Brown, I'm putting you

00:44:29,145 --> 00:44:30,413
on administrative leave

00:44:30,479 --> 00:44:31,647
pending a full report

00:44:31,714 --> 00:44:32,949
of your whereabouts.

00:44:33,015 --> 00:44:34,023
So wash your faces;
change your socks.

00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:35,825
You have a long day
ahead of you.
