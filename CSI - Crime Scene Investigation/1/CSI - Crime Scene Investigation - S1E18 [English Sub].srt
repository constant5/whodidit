00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,325
Eight years.

00:00:24,325 --> 00:00:28,229
People said
we wouldn't last.

00:00:28,296 --> 00:00:29,497
Happy Anniversary, baby.

00:00:29,564 --> 00:00:30,698
Happy Anniversary.

00:00:30,765 --> 00:00:32,767
( <i>distant dog barking</i> )

00:00:51,653 --> 00:00:54,389
She's on the sidewalk,
a block from the curb

00:00:54,455 --> 00:00:56,758
and he's in the middle
of the street.

00:00:56,824 --> 00:00:58,726
What's missing here?

00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:02,030
No car.

00:01:02,096 --> 00:01:03,264
No mercy.

00:01:03,331 --> 00:01:06,534
This guy's stabbed
at least five times.

00:01:06,601 --> 00:01:08,036
Got some reddish hair.

00:01:08,102 --> 00:01:09,704
Vic's hair is brown.

00:01:09,771 --> 00:01:11,172
They had dinner
at Andre's.

00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:14,709
Coroner's assistant
has his wallet with
the credit card receipt.

00:01:14,776 --> 00:01:16,210
They didn't bother to valet.

00:01:16,277 --> 00:01:18,212
Saved five bucks,
cost them their lives.

00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:19,380
Carjacking gone bad.

00:01:19,447 --> 00:01:21,215
Carjackers don't use knives.

00:01:21,282 --> 00:01:22,383
Never?

00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,452
They used to say,
"Never on Sunday."

00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:26,054
Then Pearl Harbor happened.

00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,622
I never say, "Never."

00:01:37,065 --> 00:01:38,599
Oh, man...

00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:40,268
We got three minutes

00:01:40,335 --> 00:01:42,270
to process
this crime scene!

00:01:42,337 --> 00:01:43,938
After that,
we lose it all to the gutters.

00:01:44,005 --> 00:01:45,239
Sarah, take over-alls.

00:01:45,306 --> 00:01:47,609
Warrick, put a cone down
on everything you bag.

00:01:47,675 --> 00:01:49,644
Nick, we got to
get these bodies

00:01:49,711 --> 00:01:51,245
into the van.

00:01:53,514 --> 00:01:54,983
Bring me a body bag.

00:01:56,517 --> 00:01:59,253
Can we get another gurney?

00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,021
We need another gurney.

00:02:00,088 --> 00:02:00,955
Go to the van.

00:02:10,298 --> 00:02:11,666
We're losing everything.

00:02:14,636 --> 00:02:18,539
Yeah...
our killer got lucky tonight.

Don't even bother
bagging it.

00:03:17,437 --> 00:03:19,205
Do we have
any eyeballs at all?

00:03:19,272 --> 00:03:21,107
It's a quiet street,
weeknight.

00:03:21,174 --> 00:03:22,942
Neighbors heard
the commotion.

00:03:23,009 --> 00:03:25,278
Kid over here, he
had the only view.

00:03:35,855 --> 00:03:37,457
What's your
name, son?

00:03:39,893 --> 00:03:41,961
Justin Green.

00:03:42,028 --> 00:03:43,563
Well, Justin,
my name's Gil Grissom.

00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,731
This is Sara Sidle.

00:03:44,798 --> 00:03:46,399
We're with
the Crime Lab.

00:03:47,801 --> 00:03:51,037
Is, uh, is that
your blood?

00:03:51,104 --> 00:03:54,240
No, i-it's his,
the one you took away.

00:03:54,307 --> 00:03:55,475
I tried to help him.

00:03:55,542 --> 00:03:57,877
I thought
I was doing everything right.

00:03:57,944 --> 00:03:59,913
I think I might have killed him.

00:03:59,979 --> 00:04:01,748
Whoa. Slow down.

00:04:01,815 --> 00:04:03,249
What did you do exactly?

00:04:04,784 --> 00:04:06,719
JUSTIN:
<i>I was crossing the street.</i>

00:04:06,786 --> 00:04:10,757
<i>This SUV came out of nowhere--</i>
<i>almost clipped me.</i>

00:04:10,824 --> 00:04:14,194
<i>I turned and there was</i>
<i>this body lying in the street.</i>

00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,895
Oh, my God.

00:04:15,962 --> 00:04:18,264
Help! Help!

00:04:18,331 --> 00:04:20,333
Somebody call 9-1-1!

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,401
<i>I freaked.</i>

00:04:21,468 --> 00:04:23,636
<i>I did everything wrong.</i>

00:04:23,703 --> 00:04:25,138
<i>I didn't tilt his head back.</i>

00:04:25,205 --> 00:04:27,407
I-I didn't clear his airway.

00:04:27,474 --> 00:04:29,843
If it makes you feel any better,
that's not what killed him.

00:04:29,909 --> 00:04:32,145
SIDLE:
Justin...

00:04:32,212 --> 00:04:34,414
we're going to need
to take your clothes.

00:04:34,481 --> 00:04:37,117
Why?

00:04:37,183 --> 00:04:39,953
Because there's blood
all over them.

00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:55,301
( <i>garbled radio transmission)</i>

00:05:21,427 --> 00:05:23,062
MAN:
Catherine?

00:05:23,129 --> 00:05:24,097
Hey.

00:05:24,164 --> 00:05:25,098
I like the hair.

00:05:25,165 --> 00:05:26,733
Thanks.
What are you doing here?

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,867
I was assigned.

00:05:27,934 --> 00:05:29,402
This is my case.

00:05:29,469 --> 00:05:30,537
Case?

00:05:30,603 --> 00:05:31,538
The building collapsed.

00:05:31,604 --> 00:05:32,872
There's nothing
criminal here.

00:05:32,939 --> 00:05:34,040
Right.

00:05:34,107 --> 00:05:37,177
That's why you were assigned--
a homicide detective.

00:05:37,243 --> 00:05:38,178
What happened?

00:05:38,244 --> 00:05:41,714
Oh, part of the basement
caved in.

00:05:41,781 --> 00:05:43,583
Brought the rest down with it.

00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:45,051
Body count?

00:05:45,118 --> 00:05:48,054
Three old women.
Sisters.

00:05:48,121 --> 00:05:50,824
One minute you're watching
<i>Wheel of Fortune--</i>

00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:52,158
next thing, game over.

00:05:52,225 --> 00:05:54,661
And you're not calling
this a crime scene?

00:05:54,727 --> 00:05:57,797
Catherine,
it's a building.

00:05:57,864 --> 00:05:58,898
O'Riley...

00:05:58,965 --> 00:06:01,901
it's a suspect.

00:06:03,136 --> 00:06:04,971
Hey, Greg.

00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:06,639
Shh.

00:06:06,706 --> 00:06:09,175
I might be looking
at the mother of
my children here.

00:06:09,242 --> 00:06:11,277
Somebody's been putting in
way too much overtime.

00:06:11,344 --> 00:06:13,179
No, man, this is serious.

00:06:13,246 --> 00:06:15,348
I had a date last night

00:06:15,415 --> 00:06:19,219
and this girl has
the most impossible
green eyes.

00:06:19,285 --> 00:06:20,286
Just... Bam.

00:06:20,353 --> 00:06:21,855
Shoulder-length
blonde hair...

00:06:21,921 --> 00:06:23,189
intelligent...

00:06:23,256 --> 00:06:25,625
and she smells so good.

00:06:25,692 --> 00:06:27,127
Cute toes?

00:06:27,193 --> 00:06:28,728
Oh... ideal.

00:06:28,795 --> 00:06:29,562
Mmm.

00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:31,397
And none are longer
than the big toe.

00:06:31,464 --> 00:06:32,398
Mmm.

00:06:32,465 --> 00:06:33,500
Both feet.

00:06:33,566 --> 00:06:35,869
But, you know, what I
need to know is

00:06:35,935 --> 00:06:37,470
what's on the inside?

00:06:37,537 --> 00:06:39,205
Oh, what's in her heart?

00:06:39,272 --> 00:06:40,440
No...

00:06:40,507 --> 00:06:41,441
her DNA...

00:06:41,508 --> 00:06:43,343
and let me tell you--

00:06:43,409 --> 00:06:46,946
this girl has got
some fine epithelials.

00:06:47,013 --> 00:06:48,081
Dude, you're sick.

00:06:48,148 --> 00:06:50,350
Man, you've officially
lost it.

00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:51,584
No, no.

00:06:51,651 --> 00:06:53,620
There is this guy
in Louisville.

00:06:53,686 --> 00:06:54,788
He charges 300 clams

00:06:54,854 --> 00:06:57,490
to test your spouse's
underwear for
foreign DNA.

00:06:57,557 --> 00:06:59,692
Now, <i>that</i> guy is sick.

00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:00,960
I'm just a romantic.

00:07:01,027 --> 00:07:02,195
But whatever happened

00:07:02,262 --> 00:07:04,631
to getting to know someone
over coffee...

00:07:04,697 --> 00:07:06,499
letting the relationship
evolve?

00:07:06,566 --> 00:07:08,501
Romantic is
sending flowers

00:07:08,568 --> 00:07:10,670
not bogarting
her skin cells.

00:07:10,737 --> 00:07:12,505
Ahh, that's boring.

00:07:12,572 --> 00:07:13,506
What are you doing?

00:07:13,573 --> 00:07:14,507
What have you got?

00:07:14,574 --> 00:07:18,077
Um, pulled some hair
off a male stabbing vic.

00:07:18,144 --> 00:07:19,379
Okay.

00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:23,983
Baby.

00:07:31,991 --> 00:07:34,427
Uh-huh.

00:07:34,494 --> 00:07:36,129
What?

00:07:36,196 --> 00:07:38,131
Nine lives.

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,233
Cat hair?

00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,235
Meow.

00:07:46,105 --> 00:07:48,641
Kevin Shepherd.
Six stab wounds
to the upper torso--

00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:50,443
one to the back,
five to the front.

00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:52,812
And his wife?

00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:53,947
Amy Shepherd.

00:07:54,013 --> 00:07:56,516
One slice across
the neck,
right to left.

00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:58,551
Work of a lefty?

00:07:58,618 --> 00:08:02,055
Well, the blade transected
the jugular vein
and both carotids.

00:08:02,122 --> 00:08:04,324
Hard to scream
when your throat's been cut.

00:08:07,727 --> 00:08:08,661
Defensive wounds.

00:08:08,728 --> 00:08:10,296
This guy put up
one hell of a fight.

00:08:10,363 --> 00:08:12,298
Attacked with two weapons.

00:08:12,365 --> 00:08:14,467
Two?

00:08:14,534 --> 00:08:17,003
Two types
of stab wounds.

00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,506
First a long,
sharp double-edged blade.

00:08:19,572 --> 00:08:21,074
The blade went in smooth...

00:08:21,141 --> 00:08:24,811
left a little
collateral bruising

00:08:24,878 --> 00:08:26,946
to the skin.

00:08:27,013 --> 00:08:29,349
Weapon number two
was blunt.

00:08:31,551 --> 00:08:34,187
Weapon number two
caused extensive bruising

00:08:34,254 --> 00:08:35,855
around the points of entry.

00:08:37,457 --> 00:08:40,560
Two weapons... two attackers.

00:08:44,964 --> 00:08:45,999
Hi.

00:08:46,065 --> 00:08:48,334
District Engineer?

00:08:48,401 --> 00:08:49,936
Ah.

00:08:50,003 --> 00:08:51,404
Follow the tie.

00:09:01,047 --> 00:09:04,050
Is that from the rain?

00:09:04,117 --> 00:09:05,552
Depends on who's asking.

00:09:05,618 --> 00:09:08,254
Are you hiding something,
or am I not worth your time?

00:09:08,321 --> 00:09:10,023
Excuse me?

00:09:10,089 --> 00:09:11,758
You are the District Engineer
of the city, right?

00:09:11,825 --> 00:09:13,927
You're responsible
for the structural safety
of this building.

00:09:13,993 --> 00:09:15,361
I'm sorry. I didn't
catch your name.

00:09:15,428 --> 00:09:18,364
Catherine Willows,
Las Vegas Crime Lab.

00:09:18,431 --> 00:09:19,632
Crime Lab?

00:09:19,699 --> 00:09:21,201
Yeah.
The building fell down.

00:09:21,267 --> 00:09:23,236
Three people
were crushed to death.

00:09:24,838 --> 00:09:28,274
Why is the wood wet?

00:09:28,341 --> 00:09:29,943
It's a flat-roofed
structure.

00:09:30,009 --> 00:09:32,145
Leaks aren't uncommon.
Maybe that explains
the dry rot.

00:09:32,212 --> 00:09:33,746
And what am I looking at?

00:09:33,813 --> 00:09:35,982
That would be Sheetrock.

00:09:36,049 --> 00:09:38,518
Drywall. But what about
this layer right here?

00:09:38,585 --> 00:09:41,421
When they installed
the original <i>drywall</i>

00:09:41,488 --> 00:09:42,555
they used half-inch

00:09:42,622 --> 00:09:45,258
and then, when they came back
and repaired it

00:09:45,325 --> 00:09:46,659
they used quarter-inch.

00:09:46,726 --> 00:09:48,828
Was the quarter-inch
on sale that day?

00:09:48,895 --> 00:09:51,131
Look, lady, I don't know
what it is...

00:09:51,197 --> 00:09:52,332
Catherine.

00:09:52,398 --> 00:09:53,433
Sorry.

00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,934
Don't say, "Sorry"

00:09:55,001 --> 00:09:56,936
just know who
you're talking to.

00:09:57,003 --> 00:09:58,805
When they applied
the second layer

00:09:58,872 --> 00:10:01,341
and then they spackled it
and they painted it

00:10:01,407 --> 00:10:03,176
the difference
wasn't noticeable.

00:10:03,243 --> 00:10:05,979
It's noticeable now.

00:10:06,045 --> 00:10:09,682
Which District Engineer
conducted the last
inspection?

00:10:09,749 --> 00:10:11,684
There's only one
District Engineer.

00:10:11,751 --> 00:10:13,620
Then it looks
bad for you.

00:10:13,686 --> 00:10:14,954
( <i>laughing</i> ):
Okay.

00:10:15,021 --> 00:10:17,690
Look, uh, Catherine,
why don't I write a report

00:10:17,757 --> 00:10:19,526
and then I'll
e-mail it to you.

00:10:19,592 --> 00:10:20,527
How would that be?

00:10:20,593 --> 00:10:22,962
Where's the point of origin
of the collapse?

00:10:25,498 --> 00:10:29,636
Look, this is my crime scene.

00:10:29,702 --> 00:10:31,437
I can find it
myself

00:10:31,504 --> 00:10:33,873
but that might mean
lots of question

00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,575
to lots of people.

00:10:35,642 --> 00:10:38,244
Well, it's just my,
uh, expert opinion

00:10:38,311 --> 00:10:40,280
but I'd say right below us--

00:10:40,346 --> 00:10:41,881
in the basement...

00:10:41,948 --> 00:10:43,450
the laundry room.

00:10:43,516 --> 00:10:45,585
Then that's where
I want to be.

00:10:46,653 --> 00:10:48,388
Hey, Griss.

00:10:48,455 --> 00:10:50,290
Kevin Shepherd,
chiropractor.

00:10:50,356 --> 00:10:51,291
Amy Shepherd,
dentist.

00:10:51,357 --> 00:10:52,292
House in the Lakes.

00:10:52,358 --> 00:10:53,293
Married eight years.

00:10:53,359 --> 00:10:54,294
Perfect credit.

00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,295
You know, I'm lost.

00:10:55,361 --> 00:10:57,597
There's nothing jumping
off the page, here.

00:10:57,664 --> 00:10:58,932
What about
the eyewitness?

00:10:58,998 --> 00:10:59,933
Justin Green.

00:10:59,999 --> 00:11:01,367
First witness,
first suspect

00:11:01,434 --> 00:11:03,203
but he hung around,
waiting for us.

00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:04,304
Covered in blood.

00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,538
But his story jibes.

00:11:05,605 --> 00:11:08,775
Several eyewitness saw him
performing CPR
on Kevin Shepherd.

00:11:08,842 --> 00:11:11,177
But if-if-if it is a carjacking,
I don't get it.

00:11:11,244 --> 00:11:12,312
Why fight
to the death?

00:11:12,378 --> 00:11:13,880
It's four wheels
and a chassis.

00:11:13,947 --> 00:11:14,981
In the heat
of the moment,

00:11:15,048 --> 00:11:16,382
it's not a car,
it's a possession

00:11:16,449 --> 00:11:19,018
and people will fight
without realizing
what they're risking.

00:11:19,085 --> 00:11:21,988
So, you are thinking the
Shepherds lost their lives
for their SUV?

00:11:22,055 --> 00:11:23,890
I'm speaking
in generalities.

00:11:23,957 --> 00:11:27,127
Regarding the Shepherds...
I'm in the dark, too

00:11:27,193 --> 00:11:28,728
just like you.

00:11:33,633 --> 00:11:36,136
Hey, Warrick.

00:11:36,202 --> 00:11:37,837
Is Grissom around?

00:11:37,904 --> 00:11:40,039
You see him?

00:11:40,106 --> 00:11:41,775
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:45,845
You know,
between you and me

00:11:45,912 --> 00:11:47,647
as long as I've been
on the job

00:11:47,714 --> 00:11:49,983
I still don't like
touching dead bodies.

00:11:50,049 --> 00:11:51,718
Well, that's why

00:11:51,785 --> 00:11:54,721
you got the badge
and I got the syringe.

00:12:11,304 --> 00:12:14,574
I'm casting the stab wounds.

00:12:14,641 --> 00:12:17,110
From the molds, we can identify
the murder weapons.

00:12:17,177 --> 00:12:20,079
You're getting more like Grissom
every day, man.

00:12:22,282 --> 00:12:24,050
Did you want me to give Griss
a message?

00:12:24,117 --> 00:12:25,151
Yeah.

00:12:25,218 --> 00:12:28,688
A patrol car located
the Shepherds' SUV.

00:12:38,131 --> 00:12:40,333
The car is registered
to our dead couple.

00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,669
When you carjack a car,
you keep the car.

00:12:42,735 --> 00:12:43,736
You don't dump it.

00:12:43,803 --> 00:12:44,904
Unless you're joyriding.

00:12:44,971 --> 00:12:46,439
Well, who kills
for a joyride?

00:12:46,506 --> 00:12:47,907
Wouldn't be the first time.

00:12:47,974 --> 00:12:49,909
Has anybody else
touched this vehicle?

00:12:49,976 --> 00:12:51,578
No, sir,
and I'm the one who found it.

00:12:51,644 --> 00:12:52,745
Just the rain.

00:12:52,812 --> 00:12:54,714
The evidence on the outside
of the vehicle

00:12:54,781 --> 00:12:55,748
will be compromised.

00:12:55,815 --> 00:12:59,052
Well, maybe there'll
be some evidence
on the inside.

00:12:59,119 --> 00:13:00,453
Whoa.

00:13:08,361 --> 00:13:10,563
Whoa.

00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,432
Well, I haven't felt that
in a while.

00:13:12,499 --> 00:13:13,666
What's that?

00:13:13,733 --> 00:13:16,369
The element of surprise.

00:13:22,953 --> 00:13:23,411
( <i>sighing</i> )

00:13:24,328 --> 00:13:25,997
What's she doing here?

00:13:26,063 --> 00:13:26,495
Good question.

00:13:26,495 --> 00:13:28,597
Better question,
who is she?

00:13:28,664 --> 00:13:30,232
Hmm.

00:13:30,299 --> 00:13:34,937
Uh. Put some gloves on.

00:13:35,003 --> 00:13:37,940
Yeah, I know.

00:13:38,006 --> 00:13:43,612
You know, I... I can't believe
you messed up the crime scene.

00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:45,981
The body fell out
when I opened the door.

00:13:46,048 --> 00:13:47,383
It happens. We move on.

00:13:47,449 --> 00:13:50,452
Mmm. Going
to bother you all day.

00:13:59,128 --> 00:14:00,896
"Jessica Hall.

00:14:00,963 --> 00:14:01,897
"Date of birth--

00:14:01,964 --> 00:14:04,133
8-5-73."

00:14:06,101 --> 00:14:08,170
Cell phone, power's off.
Didn't call 9-1-1.

00:14:08,237 --> 00:14:11,073
They would've instructed her
to leave it on.

00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,408
Seat belt's unbuckled.

00:14:12,474 --> 00:14:13,942
That's why she fell out.

00:14:14,009 --> 00:14:15,177
Yeah, so?

00:14:15,244 --> 00:14:16,712
Well, she's
in the driver's seat.

00:14:16,779 --> 00:14:17,946
Was she driving?

00:14:18,013 --> 00:14:19,615
Or could she
have been placed in here?

00:14:19,681 --> 00:14:21,984
Maybe she's
like 28% of Americans--

00:14:22,051 --> 00:14:23,519
she doesn't buckle up.

00:14:23,585 --> 00:14:25,821
I think it's 29%, actually.

00:14:25,888 --> 00:14:30,192
I'll go radio the 4-19.

00:14:51,213 --> 00:14:52,815
Hope you're not
allergic there, Boss.

00:14:52,881 --> 00:14:54,383
What?

00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:57,519
Cat hair. Found similar hair
on Kevin Shepherd's clothing.

00:14:57,586 --> 00:14:59,154
How about Amy Shepherd?

00:14:59,221 --> 00:15:01,590
Nope. No hairs on the wife.

00:15:01,657 --> 00:15:05,394
Shepherd's SUV.
Stab wound. Cat hair.

00:15:05,461 --> 00:15:07,629
She's linked
to the first crime scene.

00:15:07,696 --> 00:15:08,731
But how?

00:15:08,797 --> 00:15:10,566
Victim number three.

00:15:10,632 --> 00:15:12,134
Wrong place, wrong time.

00:15:12,201 --> 00:15:15,270
Saw something she shouldn't.

00:15:15,337 --> 00:15:17,740
Well, finally.

00:15:17,806 --> 00:15:19,108
What?

00:15:19,174 --> 00:15:21,110
Someone has a theory.

00:15:23,045 --> 00:15:25,914
Look, I-I've got guys
that are trained to do this.

00:15:25,981 --> 00:15:27,850
Why don't you
let me call them?

00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:29,952
You're going to go in there,
you're going to get

00:15:30,018 --> 00:15:31,754
that snappy little jumpsuit
dirty, and...

00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,288
No offense,
but they work for you.

00:15:33,355 --> 00:15:34,890
So what?

00:15:34,957 --> 00:15:38,927
Well, so the victims' family
deserves answers.

00:15:41,196 --> 00:15:42,898
Somebody's responsible.

00:15:42,965 --> 00:15:45,601
Hey, I didn't do
anything wrong.

00:15:45,667 --> 00:15:49,905
Well, maybe not intentionally,
but if a ship sinks

00:15:49,972 --> 00:15:53,075
the last person
who checked for leaks

00:15:53,142 --> 00:15:54,410
is negligent.

00:15:54,476 --> 00:15:56,812
You're not married, are you?

00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,816
Divorced.

00:16:05,054 --> 00:16:06,622
Okay. All right.

00:16:06,689 --> 00:16:07,956
What you see, I'll see

00:16:08,023 --> 00:16:10,092
but I just want
to go on the record.

00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:11,260
This is a bad idea.

00:16:11,326 --> 00:16:12,795
Thanks for your input.

00:16:12,861 --> 00:16:13,829
All right.

00:16:13,896 --> 00:16:15,297
We got a hot feed.

00:16:15,364 --> 00:16:16,765
I'm going in.

00:16:16,832 --> 00:16:19,268
I'll be right here.

00:16:19,334 --> 00:16:20,803
Catherine?

00:16:20,869 --> 00:16:23,505
You sure you want
to do this?

00:16:23,572 --> 00:16:26,475
Why is everybody asking
me if I want to do my job?

00:16:26,542 --> 00:16:27,910
Because we care.

00:16:27,976 --> 00:16:29,445
And?

00:16:29,511 --> 00:16:35,150
The Mayor ran
on a platform of urban renewal.

00:16:35,217 --> 00:16:39,455
Clean out the slumlords,
create habitable,
low-cost housing

00:16:39,521 --> 00:16:40,889
maintained by the city.

00:16:40,956 --> 00:16:44,326
If you find so much as a scratch
on an aspirin in there

00:16:44,393 --> 00:16:46,795
you know who it's going
to come back to.

00:16:46,862 --> 00:16:49,565
I know I have
a job to do.

00:16:49,631 --> 00:16:50,799
Excuse me.

00:16:57,973 --> 00:16:59,074
Hey, Doc.

00:16:59,141 --> 00:17:01,710
What's with the
fluoroscope?

00:17:01,777 --> 00:17:03,512
When we brought
the body into the lab

00:17:03,579 --> 00:17:05,180
she set off the metal detector.

00:17:05,247 --> 00:17:06,515
Did you check in her pockets?

00:17:06,582 --> 00:17:08,117
Nothing in the pockets.

00:17:08,183 --> 00:17:09,318
What about a pin or a plate--

00:17:09,385 --> 00:17:10,652
something metallic
on the inside?

00:17:10,719 --> 00:17:13,489
I had the same thought,
but that's not what we've found.

00:17:13,555 --> 00:17:14,957
David, take her down.

00:17:15,024 --> 00:17:17,159
Yes, sir.

00:17:18,994 --> 00:17:20,829
Cause of death,
laceration of the liver.

00:17:20,896 --> 00:17:21,830
Exsanguination.

00:17:21,897 --> 00:17:22,998
Once you nick the liver

00:17:23,065 --> 00:17:24,533
it's almost
impossible

00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,236
to stop the bleeding without
immediate medical intervention.

00:17:27,302 --> 00:17:30,305
Whoa, David.

00:17:30,372 --> 00:17:33,042
Go back up to the
12th rib, please.

00:17:33,108 --> 00:17:34,376
I was just getting to that.

00:17:38,914 --> 00:17:41,150
Our killer leave us a souvenir?

00:17:41,216 --> 00:17:42,818
What is that?

00:17:42,885 --> 00:17:44,753
What do you leave your waiter?

00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,488
A tip...

00:17:46,555 --> 00:17:48,257
of a knife.

00:17:48,323 --> 00:17:50,359
How soon can we get that
out of the body?

00:17:55,597 --> 00:17:59,368
Am I almost at ground zero?

00:17:59,435 --> 00:18:01,236
Almost. About ten more feet.

00:18:01,303 --> 00:18:03,105
Uh, then you should be
in the laundry room.

00:18:03,172 --> 00:18:04,673
You should have
more headroom, too.

00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:07,876
I feel like I'm crawling
through a straw.

00:18:07,943 --> 00:18:09,678
( <i>grunting</i> )

00:18:20,189 --> 00:18:22,458
Sweet.

00:18:22,524 --> 00:18:23,692
What? What is it?

00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:25,694
Are you getting this?

00:18:25,761 --> 00:18:27,062
What is that? A roach?

00:18:27,129 --> 00:18:30,933
I'm not an entomologist,
but I know one.

00:18:30,999 --> 00:18:32,568
He can tell us.

00:18:32,634 --> 00:18:34,737
( <i>rumbling</i> )

00:18:36,138 --> 00:18:39,308
I thought this building
was secure.

00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:41,110
It is secure. Just hang on.

00:18:41,176 --> 00:18:42,544
The daily sorties.

00:18:42,611 --> 00:18:44,546
I think that was an F-16.

00:18:44,613 --> 00:18:47,683
Nellis Air Force Base.

00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,451
About a mile south of here.

00:18:49,518 --> 00:18:51,620
Anything else I should, uh

00:18:51,687 --> 00:18:53,055
be aware of?

00:18:53,122 --> 00:18:55,724
You're in the clear.

00:18:59,294 --> 00:19:01,597
Okay.

00:19:22,484 --> 00:19:24,253
Okay.

00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:27,322
I'm in the laundry room...

00:19:27,389 --> 00:19:29,291
what's left of it.

00:19:29,358 --> 00:19:31,393
You want to talk me
through this?

00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,428
Okay, look up.

00:19:32,494 --> 00:19:34,630
You should be able
to see the beam now.

00:19:38,534 --> 00:19:39,968
Got it.

00:19:40,035 --> 00:19:42,471
All right, connected to the beam

00:19:42,538 --> 00:19:44,907
running vertically
to the concrete foundation

00:19:44,973 --> 00:19:46,275
are the support columns.

00:19:46,341 --> 00:19:48,844
Now, in a perfect world,
they should be steel

00:19:48,911 --> 00:19:50,713
but given the age
of the building

00:19:50,779 --> 00:19:51,847
they might be wood.

00:19:51,914 --> 00:19:53,449
Yeah, it's wood, all right.

00:19:59,188 --> 00:20:03,125
And it looks like somebody
took a sledgehammer to it.

00:20:05,194 --> 00:20:07,796
So you really pulled this
out of a corpse?

00:20:07,863 --> 00:20:08,897
SIDLE:
Yeah...

00:20:08,964 --> 00:20:10,132
but I cleaned
it for you.

00:20:10,199 --> 00:20:12,134
We need to know
the make of that knife.

00:20:12,201 --> 00:20:13,402
Well, it's not a knife.

00:20:13,469 --> 00:20:14,703
The tip's double-edged.

00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:16,772
Bevels on both sides,
downward slope.

00:20:16,839 --> 00:20:18,173
This came from a dagger

00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,876
which means it's
either carbon steel

00:20:20,943 --> 00:20:22,177
or stainless steel.

00:20:22,244 --> 00:20:24,680
I get asked this question
more than you think.

00:20:24,747 --> 00:20:26,915
SIDLE:
Acid in the
lemon juice

00:20:26,982 --> 00:20:29,518
should react to carbon steel,
but not stainless steel.

00:20:29,585 --> 00:20:30,686
How's a cop know all this?

00:20:30,753 --> 00:20:32,755
He's the cop.
I'm the scientist.

00:20:32,821 --> 00:20:34,723
I got a cop question.
What are we looking for here?

00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,525
Dark spots.

00:20:36,592 --> 00:20:38,360
SIDLE:
Carbon steel.

00:20:38,427 --> 00:20:39,428
What's next?

00:20:39,495 --> 00:20:40,429
Length.

00:20:40,496 --> 00:20:41,463
Daggers are
rarely more

00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:42,564
than an inch
at the base.

00:20:42,631 --> 00:20:43,565
We got the tip.

00:20:43,632 --> 00:20:46,602
So, we can fill in the rest.

00:20:46,668 --> 00:20:48,303
Basic geometry.

00:20:57,413 --> 00:21:01,350
Five inches.

00:21:01,417 --> 00:21:03,552
Top row-- five-inch daggers,
carbon steel.

00:21:03,619 --> 00:21:05,788
This is the one you want.

00:21:05,854 --> 00:21:08,891
$24.99. We don't
take credit cards.

00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,696
WARRICK:
Forget Shepherd's wife.

00:21:13,762 --> 00:21:15,230
I can't match
the slash marks.

00:21:15,297 --> 00:21:17,166
It's all about
these stab wounds.

00:21:17,232 --> 00:21:19,301
So I concentrated
on Kevin Shepherd.

00:21:19,368 --> 00:21:21,003
This is a nice job, Warrick.

00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,705
You know, casting is an art.

00:21:22,771 --> 00:21:23,672
And while the artist

00:21:23,739 --> 00:21:24,940
was at work,
Brass and I

00:21:25,007 --> 00:21:27,409
identified Jessica Hall's
murder weapon

00:21:27,476 --> 00:21:29,645
from the tip we found
lodged in her ribs.

00:21:29,712 --> 00:21:32,381
It's a dagger.
Fugasi Model 502.

00:21:32,448 --> 00:21:33,515
Cool.

00:21:33,582 --> 00:21:34,516
So we've identified

00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:36,218
the weapon used
on Jessica Hall.

00:21:36,285 --> 00:21:38,721
Was it also used
on Kevin Shepherd?

00:21:38,787 --> 00:21:42,224
Well, I measured all
the sharp points of entry

00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:43,525
on Kevin's body.

00:21:43,592 --> 00:21:44,993
They're all identical.

00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:47,429
They're all made
from the same murder weapon.

00:21:47,496 --> 00:21:49,998
So, if this dagger
matches your mold...

00:22:00,476 --> 00:22:02,244
SIDLE:
Okay.

00:22:02,311 --> 00:22:04,079
We just put
the sharp wounds to bed.

00:22:04,146 --> 00:22:06,248
Identified
murder weapon number one.

00:22:06,315 --> 00:22:10,486
Now we just need
that second murder weapon.

00:22:10,552 --> 00:22:12,988
Points of impact on these
two are blunt, right?

00:22:13,055 --> 00:22:14,890
WARRICK:
Yeah, who stabs someone

00:22:14,957 --> 00:22:16,759
with a blunt instrument?

00:22:16,825 --> 00:22:18,327
Sara, you still have

00:22:18,394 --> 00:22:19,795
the dagger tip from the body?

00:22:19,862 --> 00:22:20,796
Yeah?

00:22:20,863 --> 00:22:21,997
And you have the cast

00:22:22,064 --> 00:22:24,566
of the unidentified
murder weapon.

00:22:24,633 --> 00:22:25,801
Yeah.

00:22:25,868 --> 00:22:27,403
A dagger's not a diamond.

00:22:27,469 --> 00:22:29,071
It doesn't last forever.

00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,582
We don't have two weapons.

00:22:44,486 --> 00:22:45,621
So he started with Kevin

00:22:45,687 --> 00:22:47,356
and then he went
after Jessica

00:22:47,423 --> 00:22:48,857
and then the tip broke off.

00:22:48,924 --> 00:22:51,026
And then he went back
to Kevin to finish the job.

00:22:51,093 --> 00:22:54,296
One weapon, one killer.

00:22:57,926 --> 00:23:00,362
An <i>Anobiid</i> powder-post beetle.

00:23:00,429 --> 00:23:01,863
Very nice specimen.

00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:03,231
He likes you, too.

00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:04,900
Now, tell me about him.

00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:06,435
Your building collapsed.

00:23:06,501 --> 00:23:07,836
You assigned me the case.

00:23:07,903 --> 00:23:09,104
You already know that.

00:23:09,171 --> 00:23:11,373
And this little guy
confirms it.

00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,076
This species of beetle
eats softwood.

00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:16,078
Tell me about the building.

00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:19,047
The frame's made
of Douglas fir.

00:23:19,114 --> 00:23:21,383
A delicacy.

00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:23,385
I did find
more than a bug.

00:23:23,452 --> 00:23:27,189
Dry rot, questionable repairs,
a jittery engineer.

00:23:27,256 --> 00:23:29,258
And check this out.

00:23:30,792 --> 00:23:35,964
GRISSOM:
Forget the beetle;
this damage was intentional.

00:23:36,031 --> 00:23:37,966
You're looking
for a Homo sapiens.

00:23:38,033 --> 00:23:41,270
I know. Gives new meaning
to "home wrecker."

00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:44,573
Catherine, there's a reason
I assigned you this case.

00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,410
You're good with people,
both the dead and the living.

00:23:48,477 --> 00:23:51,480
Translation: we're opening
a political can of worms.

00:23:51,546 --> 00:23:53,548
The mayor's involved,
an election's around the corner

00:23:53,615 --> 00:23:56,618
and you could've clued me in
a little earlier.

00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:57,986
Can I keep it?

00:23:58,053 --> 00:24:00,589
Sorry. It's evidence.

00:24:00,656 --> 00:24:02,257
Don't forget to feed him.

00:24:02,324 --> 00:24:05,494
I know-- wood.

00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:08,664
WARRICK:
Oh, yeah.

00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:12,334
I got three prints
on this gearshift

00:24:12,401 --> 00:24:14,169
and they are beauties.

00:24:14,236 --> 00:24:16,271
Sweaty palms make
the best prints.

00:24:17,306 --> 00:24:20,909
The coroner just
sent over a ten card

00:24:20,976 --> 00:24:23,011
of Jessica Hall's fingerprints.

00:24:23,078 --> 00:24:25,480
Evidently,
I'm the new delivery boy.

00:24:27,316 --> 00:24:29,351
Are you doing
what I think you're doing?

00:24:29,418 --> 00:24:31,320
If we find
what we're looking for

00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:32,955
the answer is yes.

00:24:33,021 --> 00:24:34,723
Can I see those prints?

00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:37,526
The photos are printing.

00:24:39,361 --> 00:24:40,796
Thanks.

00:24:50,939 --> 00:24:52,507
No need for AFIS.

00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:53,742
We got a visual match.

00:24:53,809 --> 00:24:55,944
All three prints belong
to victim number three.

00:24:56,011 --> 00:24:57,913
So Jessica Hall
was the last person

00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,514
to drive the
Shepherds' SUV.

00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:01,116
What does that give us?

00:25:01,183 --> 00:25:03,151
She was stabbed
at the crime scene,
but then what?

00:25:03,218 --> 00:25:05,187
Was she driving herself
to the hospital?

00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:07,055
Was she under duress?

00:25:07,122 --> 00:25:08,523
None of the above.

00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:11,059
Hey, Grissom, you know
that theory I had?

00:25:11,126 --> 00:25:12,995
Yeah.
I'd like to revise it.

00:25:13,061 --> 00:25:15,097
It's a scientist's right
to reexamine his theory

00:25:15,163 --> 00:25:16,798
with each new piece
of evidence, Nick.

00:25:16,865 --> 00:25:19,568
My evidence is
in the layout room.

00:25:19,635 --> 00:25:21,803
All the wounds sustained
by Kevin Shepherd

00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:23,805
were to his torso.

00:25:23,872 --> 00:25:26,508
Now, look at this.

00:25:30,379 --> 00:25:34,816
Blood flow on the left instep
of Kevin Shepherd's shoe.

00:25:34,883 --> 00:25:36,585
WARRICK:
Lucky for us

00:25:36,652 --> 00:25:37,819
the rain missed that.

00:25:37,886 --> 00:25:39,388
When death is not immediate

00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:42,557
the victim will instinctively
curl up into a fetal position.

00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:44,593
Which may have protected
this from the rain.

00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,894
Preserving blood pattern.

00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,596
You expect blood on a victim

00:25:47,663 --> 00:25:49,765
but let's ask
the question:

00:25:49,831 --> 00:25:51,867
could the normal action
and behavior of our victim

00:25:51,934 --> 00:25:53,035
have put his blood there?

00:25:53,101 --> 00:25:55,237
The victim was lying
on the ground

00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:57,539
wounds above the waist.

00:25:57,606 --> 00:25:59,374
It's not Kevin's blood.

00:25:59,441 --> 00:26:01,109
Who else had a flowing wound?

00:26:01,176 --> 00:26:03,011
Amy Shepherd was too far away

00:26:03,078 --> 00:26:05,447
but Jessica Hall
was alive and bleeding.

00:26:05,514 --> 00:26:08,450
Okay. How did her blood
get on his shoe?

00:26:08,517 --> 00:26:11,186
Gravity.

00:26:11,253 --> 00:26:14,222
Warrick, please,
on the floor

00:26:14,289 --> 00:26:15,457
on your back.

00:26:15,524 --> 00:26:17,559
Man, why are you always
trying to put me down?

00:26:17,626 --> 00:26:20,429
Sara, you're Jessica.

00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:21,730
Come on, now.

00:26:21,797 --> 00:26:23,799
SARA:
Okay.

00:26:31,473 --> 00:26:34,343
All right, I'm bleeding
from my abdomen.

00:26:34,409 --> 00:26:38,747
Standing here, I'm not
going to get that much
blood on Warrick.

00:26:38,814 --> 00:26:40,415
Get closer.

00:26:40,482 --> 00:26:42,985
Well, I can't without...
stepping on him.

00:26:43,051 --> 00:26:45,254
You can if you kneel down.

00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,322
Why would she do that?

00:26:47,389 --> 00:26:50,092
Possibly to help

00:26:50,158 --> 00:26:52,094
or to hinder.

00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,163
I say hinder.

00:26:58,133 --> 00:26:59,468
( <i>loud gasp</i> )

00:27:06,074 --> 00:27:07,576
She was in on it.

00:27:07,643 --> 00:27:09,244
She held him down

00:27:09,311 --> 00:27:10,912
while someone else stabbed him.

00:27:10,979 --> 00:27:13,882
By the positioning
of the wound

00:27:13,949 --> 00:27:17,619
I'd say it looked
like her stabbing
was an accident.

00:27:17,686 --> 00:27:20,188
Stabbing's are
messy and inexact.

00:27:20,255 --> 00:27:24,793
So victim number three
becomes suspect number two.

00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:27,462
GRISSOM:
Nick, get a warrant for
Jessica Hall's apartment.

00:27:27,529 --> 00:27:31,166
We'll see if suspect number two
leads us to suspect number one.

00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:33,235
And bring a scorecard with you.

00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:36,772
Can, uh, can I give
you a hand with that?

00:27:36,838 --> 00:27:38,340
No.

00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:42,177
How did you get in here?

00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:47,049
Well, I flashed my city I.D.
and, uh, my smile.

00:27:49,184 --> 00:27:52,354
What are we looking for?

00:27:53,689 --> 00:27:56,625
A lot of factors contributed
to the collapse.

00:27:56,692 --> 00:27:58,660
I'm focusing
on the human element.

00:28:02,664 --> 00:28:06,501
Now... if a sledgehammer was
taken to this column recently

00:28:06,568 --> 00:28:08,704
there'd be evidence
of discoloration.

00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:11,573
The damaged part
would be lighter.

00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,275
May I?

00:28:20,916 --> 00:28:22,751
Hands off.
Oh, right. Sorry.

00:28:22,818 --> 00:28:25,821
No. No discoloration.

00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:28,924
Would you like to know why?

00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,560
Yeah.

00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:34,663
Five years ago, this building
was apartment Vietnam.

00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:36,164
The facility
was substandard.

00:28:36,231 --> 00:28:37,833
The city turned
its back on it.

00:28:37,899 --> 00:28:39,201
The tenants revolted.

00:28:39,268 --> 00:28:42,537
Blake Neferson,
apartment 204

00:28:42,604 --> 00:28:44,940
took a sledgehammer
to that column.

00:28:45,007 --> 00:28:47,509
It's public record--
he was arrested.

00:28:47,576 --> 00:28:49,111
Public record?

00:28:49,177 --> 00:28:52,915
And you failed to indicate
the damage

00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:54,950
in your inspection report?

00:28:55,017 --> 00:28:58,220
There wasn't enough damage
to cause concern.

00:28:59,922 --> 00:29:03,392
Tell that to the women
who were crushed to death.

00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:19,441
I heard the lab matched
the blood

00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:21,443
on Kevin Shepherd's shoe
to Jessica.

00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,612
My theory's getting
better and better.

BRASS:
Not so fast, Nicholas.

00:29:25,447 --> 00:29:27,716
P.D. traced a call Shepherd made
to Jessica

00:29:27,783 --> 00:29:29,318
from Andre's Restaurant.

00:29:29,384 --> 00:29:32,054
What's he doing calling
the woman who helped kill him?

00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,122
It's your theory, pal.

00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:16,999
Our little Jessica

00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:20,102
was a prolific note-taker.

00:30:20,168 --> 00:30:22,104
"Be a good person today."

00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:25,207
Yeah, right.
Try not to kill too many people.

00:30:25,274 --> 00:30:26,808
"Cancel water cooler delivery."

00:30:26,875 --> 00:30:28,644
"Plan girl's night out."

00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:30,545
"Light bulbs for porch."

NICK:
I think I found a key
piece of evidence.

00:30:54,002 --> 00:30:56,371
The redhead
we've been looking for.

00:30:56,438 --> 00:30:57,673
Red hairs on Jessica.

00:30:57,739 --> 00:30:59,007
She owns a tabby cat.

00:30:59,074 --> 00:31:00,409
Red hairs on Shepherd.

00:31:00,475 --> 00:31:03,178
Chances are Shepherd was here
without his wife.

00:31:03,245 --> 00:31:05,080
BRASS:
Yeah. I'm going to run

00:31:05,147 --> 00:31:06,982
Jessica's cell phone records
and Shepherd's.

00:31:07,049 --> 00:31:08,817
If anything was going on
between those two

00:31:08,884 --> 00:31:10,485
we'll find out.

00:31:10,552 --> 00:31:12,287
Let's go.

$500 a week--
probably her weekly paycheck.

00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:08,043
And then a $35,000 day?

00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:10,379
What, she win the lottery?

00:32:10,445 --> 00:32:13,115
How does a girl who
makes $2,000 a month

00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:16,118
pull in $35,000...

00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:19,655
only to give it away
on the same day?

00:32:19,721 --> 00:32:22,557
Let's see who she gave it to.

00:32:22,624 --> 00:32:24,993
It hasn't posted yet.

No luck.

00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:29,464
Wait. Go back.

00:32:34,569 --> 00:32:39,408
Well, we know who she
got it from-- Kevin Shepherd.

00:32:39,474 --> 00:32:41,543
Wait a minute--
Shepherd paid Jessica

00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:43,178
to murder him <i>and</i> his wife?

00:32:43,245 --> 00:32:45,280
Maybe. Maybe not.

00:32:47,316 --> 00:32:49,484
We can't speak
from the evidence, Nick

00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:51,920
and everybody else is dead.

00:32:57,165 --> 00:32:58,724
I took this from
our suspect's apartment.

00:32:58,724 --> 00:33:00,025
Husband and wife carjacking.

00:33:00,092 --> 00:33:01,159
I heard about the case.

00:33:01,226 --> 00:33:02,661
My friend and I
eat at Andre's.

00:33:02,728 --> 00:33:03,829
Creepy.

00:33:03,895 --> 00:33:05,697
Don't cancel
your next reservation.

00:33:05,764 --> 00:33:09,334
It wasn't
a carjacking.

00:33:09,401 --> 00:33:11,637
Well, it's a fresh pad.

00:33:11,703 --> 00:33:13,138
Only a couple
of pages missing.

00:33:13,205 --> 00:33:15,340
Let's see what she wrote
on those missing pages.

00:33:56,982 --> 00:33:59,284
"Quarters for laundry."

00:33:59,351 --> 00:34:00,652
Not incriminating.

00:34:00,719 --> 00:34:02,721
"Pay parking ticket."

00:34:02,788 --> 00:34:03,922
"Andre's at 9:00 p.m."

00:34:03,989 --> 00:34:05,524
Whoa.

00:34:05,591 --> 00:34:08,460
"Andre's, 9:00 p.m.

00:34:08,527 --> 00:34:09,928
"Green SUV.

00:34:09,995 --> 00:34:11,129
"Corner of Sixth.

00:34:11,196 --> 00:34:13,599
"Sunday, K's office, 8:00 a.m."

00:34:13,665 --> 00:34:15,100
This is a blueprint
for murder.

00:34:15,167 --> 00:34:16,401
Assuming "K" is Kevin

00:34:16,468 --> 00:34:18,637
they were planning
to meet three days

00:34:18,704 --> 00:34:20,005
after he was murdered.

00:34:20,072 --> 00:34:21,340
He paid Jessica $35,000.

00:34:21,406 --> 00:34:23,442
He called her as he was
leaving the restaurant.

00:34:23,508 --> 00:34:24,676
He wasn't supposed to die.

00:34:24,743 --> 00:34:26,278
No. Neither was Jessica.

00:34:26,345 --> 00:34:28,981
Kevin Shepherd took
a hit out on his wife

00:34:29,047 --> 00:34:30,682
and something went wrong.

00:34:30,749 --> 00:34:32,417
And we may
have the proof.

00:34:32,484 --> 00:34:33,819
Okay, we've got the blueprint

00:34:33,885 --> 00:34:36,421
and Kevin Shepherd's credit
card receipt from Andre's.

00:34:36,488 --> 00:34:37,789
Okay.

00:34:37,856 --> 00:34:40,892
Now, normally, a signature
wouldn't give us much.

00:34:40,959 --> 00:34:43,328
But look at the "K"
on the receipt.

00:34:43,395 --> 00:34:46,064
Now, look at the "K"
in "K's office."

00:34:46,131 --> 00:34:47,299
Okay?

00:34:47,366 --> 00:34:48,533
Also, look at the "S"

00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,636
in "SUV" and "Sunday."

00:34:50,702 --> 00:34:53,705
Now, look at the "S"
in Shepherd.

00:34:53,772 --> 00:34:55,407
Both letters are identical.

00:34:55,474 --> 00:34:57,376
He wrote both these documents.

00:34:57,442 --> 00:34:59,611
I think Shepherd planned
the murder of his wife.

00:34:59,678 --> 00:35:01,146
I'm with you.

00:35:01,213 --> 00:35:02,447
Why'd he end up dead?

00:35:02,514 --> 00:35:03,448
Bad karma.

00:35:03,515 --> 00:35:04,616
Jessica and
this Shepherd guy

00:35:04,683 --> 00:35:05,751
had been phoning
each other

00:35:05,817 --> 00:35:07,286
day and night
for the past two years.

00:35:07,352 --> 00:35:08,320
What does that tell you?

00:35:08,387 --> 00:35:10,722
They had a very healthy
relationship.

00:35:10,789 --> 00:35:12,291
He was cheating
on his wife, Amy.

00:35:12,357 --> 00:35:13,492
And there's more.

00:35:13,558 --> 00:35:15,894
On the night of the murder,
after Jessica got off the phone

00:35:15,961 --> 00:35:17,229
with Shepherd, she made a call.

00:35:17,296 --> 00:35:18,764
To who?

00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:20,399
( <i>buzzer</i> )

00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,403
Grissom didn't say what
he was looking for, huh?

00:35:24,469 --> 00:35:25,804
No.

00:35:25,871 --> 00:35:29,374
He just said check
his clothes.

00:35:29,441 --> 00:35:30,976
Drying Room.

00:35:31,043 --> 00:35:33,912
Six years in the job and it
still freaks me out in here.

00:35:33,979 --> 00:35:36,048
I think it's peaceful.

00:35:36,114 --> 00:35:38,150
Yeah.

00:35:40,686 --> 00:35:43,455
WARRICK:
Here we go. Here we go.

00:35:43,522 --> 00:35:45,090
Justin Green.

00:35:45,157 --> 00:35:46,825
Eyewitness.

00:35:46,892 --> 00:35:48,226
He's a suspect?

00:35:48,293 --> 00:35:49,761
When did that happen?

00:35:50,862 --> 00:35:54,266
Here's another thing
the rain ruined--

00:35:54,333 --> 00:35:57,703
the blood pattern
on Justin's jacket.

00:35:57,769 --> 00:35:59,471
Not the T-shirt.

00:36:01,907 --> 00:36:03,308
Warrick...

00:36:04,509 --> 00:36:07,079
What does that
look like to you?

00:36:07,145 --> 00:36:08,680
That looks like
a handprint.

00:36:08,747 --> 00:36:11,683
Right hand.

00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:13,919
Justin's?

00:36:13,986 --> 00:36:16,021
Wrist doesn't
bend that way.

00:36:16,088 --> 00:36:18,123
So, it's not Justin's.

00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:19,691
We know where
Jessica's hands were.

00:36:19,758 --> 00:36:21,360
Holding down Kevin's feet.

00:36:21,426 --> 00:36:23,528
And Amy Shepherd
died instantly.

00:36:23,595 --> 00:36:25,297
So, whose handprint is that?

00:36:25,364 --> 00:36:27,532
Kevin Shepherd's.

00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:30,202
This is a transparency

00:36:30,269 --> 00:36:31,903
of Kevin Shepherd's
defense wounds.

00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:37,309
They fit perfectly over the
handprint on Justin's shirt.

00:36:37,376 --> 00:36:40,646
Justin's story was
that he performed CPR
on Kevin Shepherd.

00:36:40,712 --> 00:36:42,614
Yeah, but Kevin grabbed
Justin's shirt

00:36:42,681 --> 00:36:44,549
so that means he
was still breathing.

00:36:44,616 --> 00:36:46,518
Which means he didn't need CPR.

00:36:46,585 --> 00:36:49,888
We just put the dagger
in Justin Green's hand.

00:36:54,493 --> 00:36:56,028
Damn it.

00:36:56,094 --> 00:36:59,398
Justin sold me a lie
and I bought it.

( <i>aircraft approaching</i> )

00:37:26,959 --> 00:37:29,995
What are you doing?

00:37:30,062 --> 00:37:32,431
Proving that you're
not responsible

00:37:32,497 --> 00:37:34,900
for what happened
to that building.

00:37:34,967 --> 00:37:37,703
I'm growing on you.
Aren't I?

00:37:39,137 --> 00:37:41,707
The damaged support
column buckled.

00:37:41,773 --> 00:37:43,475
Why?

00:37:43,542 --> 00:37:45,944
The weight of the building
wasn't evenly distributed

00:37:46,011 --> 00:37:48,046
out to the load-bearing
walls by the joists.

00:37:48,113 --> 00:37:49,114
Good.

00:37:49,181 --> 00:37:50,949
We're on the same page.

00:37:51,016 --> 00:37:55,587
Now, I put a section of the
floor assembly in the tank.

00:37:55,654 --> 00:37:57,923
I added a dozen or so of my
daughter's Superballs

00:37:57,990 --> 00:37:59,191
two sub-woofers...

00:37:59,258 --> 00:38:01,660
You put the whole thing
on vibration isolators.

00:38:01,727 --> 00:38:02,861
Exactly.

00:38:02,928 --> 00:38:05,030
Because I suspect
that sound vibrations

00:38:05,097 --> 00:38:07,499
may be the ultimate
cause of the collapse.

00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:11,169
( <i>Beethoven's Ninth</i>
<i>Symphony plays</i> )

00:38:11,236 --> 00:38:13,672
Are you saying Beethoven
brought down the building?

00:38:13,739 --> 00:38:16,008
No, but, uh, maybe F-16s

00:38:16,074 --> 00:38:21,513
and whatever else they're flying
out of Nellis Air Force Base.

00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:22,948
Now, I ramped up

00:38:23,015 --> 00:38:24,149
the decibels on the stereo

00:38:24,216 --> 00:38:25,984
to maximize
the vibrations.

00:38:26,051 --> 00:38:27,352
Now you've lost me.

00:38:31,323 --> 00:38:33,625
Watch the bouncing balls.

00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:49,574
The nails are rotating.

00:38:49,641 --> 00:38:51,944
Like screws.

00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:53,812
Righty, tighty.
Lefty, loosey.

00:38:53,879 --> 00:38:54,880
Of course.

00:38:54,947 --> 00:38:58,216
Loose nails,
bounce in the joists.

00:38:58,283 --> 00:39:00,552
Multiply that
by 50 years of flybys.

No.

Yes.

to say to me?

As a matter of fact, yes.

Could've saved yourself
a lot of trouble

by not making me a suspect
in the first place.

00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:36,759
Jessica would've steered clear
of the crime scene.

00:40:36,826 --> 00:40:37,927
STOKES:
Maybe not.

00:40:37,994 --> 00:40:39,629
In 1997

00:40:39,695 --> 00:40:42,031
Jessica and Justin
had a joint account.

00:40:42,098 --> 00:40:44,934
And they shared
the same last name.

00:40:45,001 --> 00:40:47,503
Whew. Curveball.

00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,472
BRASS:
<i>So she hired her ex-husband</i>

00:40:49,539 --> 00:40:51,774
<i>to help her kill</i>
<i>her boyfriend's wife.</i>

00:40:51,841 --> 00:40:54,010
All in the family.

00:40:54,076 --> 00:40:55,511
I can trump that.

00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:56,612
Sorry, Nick.

00:40:56,679 --> 00:40:58,414
Thursday, 11:09 a.m.

00:40:58,481 --> 00:41:02,218
$70,000 was transferred
to Justin Green's account.

00:41:02,285 --> 00:41:03,452
From?

00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:04,854
Not Jessica.

00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:05,855
Not Kevin.

00:41:05,922 --> 00:41:07,623
Only one left is Amy.

00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:08,958
WARRICK:
I can trump that.

00:41:09,025 --> 00:41:11,027
Wednesday, 3:00 p.m.

00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:12,695
Justin called Amy Shepherd.

00:41:12,762 --> 00:41:14,697
Oh, I bet I can tell you
that conversation.

00:41:14,764 --> 00:41:17,500
Do you really expect me
to believe that?

00:41:17,567 --> 00:41:19,569
Yeah. Look, you've got
to know about the affair.

00:41:19,635 --> 00:41:21,037
Check his bank account.

00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:23,573
He paid out 35.

00:41:23,639 --> 00:41:25,641
You want to counter?

00:41:25,708 --> 00:41:27,710
Amy Shepherd does
the unthinkable.

00:41:27,777 --> 00:41:28,978
She doubles it.

00:41:29,045 --> 00:41:30,980
Why kill one when you
can take out both

00:41:31,047 --> 00:41:32,482
and collect over 100 grand?

00:41:32,548 --> 00:41:34,083
Makes financial sense.

00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:37,753
And Justin secures his double
cross with an insurance policy.

00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:40,022
He eliminates
the person that hired him.

00:41:40,089 --> 00:41:42,091
Jessica wasn't stabbed
by accident.

00:41:42,158 --> 00:41:43,726
She was a loose end.

00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,877
It's over, man.

00:42:00,943 --> 00:42:03,880
It's over.

00:42:03,946 --> 00:42:05,748
Look, you better split.

00:42:05,815 --> 00:42:07,783
Go call 9-1-1.

00:42:10,853 --> 00:42:11,921
( <i>Jessica gasps</i> )

00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:16,959
Stop! What are you doing?

00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:19,199
Shut up you slut!

00:42:19,199 --> 00:42:20,420
( <i>screams</i> )

00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:23,700
She's always going to be my wife
you're never going to have her. 

00:42:36,835 --> 00:42:38,303
( <i>engine revving</i> )

00:42:43,508 --> 00:42:46,278
( <i>dog barking</i> )

00:42:48,657 --> 00:42:52,428
Call an ambulance!

00:42:54,764 --> 00:42:56,199
Jessica took the car.

00:42:56,266 --> 00:42:58,768
You hid in plain sight,
offering aid to the victim.

00:42:58,835 --> 00:43:01,204
Normally, when they pay
to have someone killed

00:43:01,271 --> 00:43:03,740
they do it so they're not
connected to the crime.

00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:07,077
Why was Jessica even there?

00:43:16,119 --> 00:43:17,487
Timmy.

00:43:17,554 --> 00:43:18,722
The Shepherds--
to the world

00:43:18,788 --> 00:43:20,323
they looked like
the perfect couple.

00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:21,925
You know what they say
about looks.

00:43:21,992 --> 00:43:23,093
They can be deceiving?

00:43:23,159 --> 00:43:24,327
They can kill.
