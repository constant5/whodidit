( <i>thunder crashing</i> )

00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,334
( <i>screaming</i> )

00:01:04,845 --> 00:01:06,214
Eileen Jane Snow.

00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,715
Lady she
carpools with

00:01:07,782 --> 00:01:10,117
couldn't get her
to answer the door.

00:01:10,184 --> 00:01:12,053
Police broke in.

00:01:15,189 --> 00:01:17,191
This is exactly the same
as the last two.

00:01:17,258 --> 00:01:20,194
Audrey Hayes
was strangled
in her basement

00:01:20,261 --> 00:01:22,463
and the other one
ended up in a park.

00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,132
Different M.O.,
but it's the same signature.

00:01:25,199 --> 00:01:26,767
M.O. is how he breaks in.

00:01:26,834 --> 00:01:29,170
Signature's what he does
once inside.

00:01:29,237 --> 00:01:31,372
Three or four

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,542
overpowering blows to the head
from a homemade weapon

00:01:34,609 --> 00:01:36,043
fashioned
at the scene.

00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:38,713
Forces her to drink a mixture
of sodium amytal

00:01:38,779 --> 00:01:40,848
as a chemical
restraint.

00:01:40,915 --> 00:01:44,585
Overligature of the victim

00:01:44,652 --> 00:01:46,487
and an object rape.

00:01:46,554 --> 00:01:49,056
Then he strangles her.

00:01:49,123 --> 00:01:51,526
Ejaculates on the bedsheets.

00:01:51,592 --> 00:01:54,295
And as a final
act of degradation

00:01:54,362 --> 00:01:56,464
he poses her
like a pinup.

00:01:56,531 --> 00:01:57,965
Damn it.

00:01:59,267 --> 00:02:00,334
Sara.

00:02:00,401 --> 00:02:02,570
Damn that guy.

00:02:04,272 --> 00:02:06,040
Listen, no
emotions in here.

00:02:06,107 --> 00:02:07,708
He's escalating,
Grissom.

00:02:07,775 --> 00:02:10,211
That's the pattern;
it's a continuum.

00:02:10,278 --> 00:02:12,146
Guess he wants
to get caught.

00:02:12,213 --> 00:02:15,049
Signature killers never
want to get caught.

00:02:15,116 --> 00:02:17,418
And they won't stop
until they do.

I have tape-lifted,

I'm not finding
one hair.


00:02:57,873 --> 00:02:59,975
I wonder what that might mean.


00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:03,545
He vacuumed this place
before he left.


00:03:03,612 --> 00:03:06,047
We've established
that he utilizes


00:03:06,114 --> 00:03:09,117
materials
from the victim's domicile.


00:03:23,331 --> 00:03:24,900
Hey, guys.


00:03:24,966 --> 00:03:27,102
He took the bag.


00:03:28,403 --> 00:03:29,838
Well, look for prints.


00:03:29,905 --> 00:03:31,239
Don't bother.


00:03:31,306 --> 00:03:32,340
There aren't any.


00:03:32,407 --> 00:03:33,942
Just like the last time.


00:03:34,009 --> 00:03:35,277
The guy's Mr. Clean.


00:03:35,343 --> 00:03:36,945
Here, knock yourself out.


00:03:37,012 --> 00:03:38,447
He stalked
this woman.


00:03:38,513 --> 00:03:41,183
He knew how much time
he had in this apartment


00:03:41,249 --> 00:03:43,785
to kill her,
and to clean up after himself.


00:03:43,852 --> 00:03:45,554
I'll tell Brass
to check for sex offenders


00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,555
in a two-mile radius.


00:03:46,621 --> 00:03:48,623
Yeah, have him check
peeping Toms, too


00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:49,791
five years back.


00:03:49,858 --> 00:03:51,359
That's how they
get started.


00:03:51,426 --> 00:03:53,295
Peeping Toms to murderers?


00:03:53,361 --> 00:03:55,163
It's about crossing boundaries.


00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:57,199
It's like, uh,
with cake, you know?


00:03:57,265 --> 00:04:00,402
You're just going to have
a little bit of the frosting


00:04:00,469 --> 00:04:01,703
and you end up eating


00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:02,904
the entire plate.


00:04:06,526 --> 00:04:08,461
BROWN:
Nobody move.


00:04:14,846 --> 00:04:16,815
Mr. Clean needs a maid.


00:04:18,316 --> 00:04:19,618
I'm going to take this


00:04:19,684 --> 00:04:21,319
back to the lab.


00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:22,521
Gil.


00:04:22,587 --> 00:04:24,890
I need a word
with you outside.


00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:33,698
You're bringing
the FBI in? Why?


00:04:33,765 --> 00:04:37,169
They offered their assistance,
and I'm inclined to take it.


00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:39,271
Of course, uh,
I'd want to make sure


00:04:39,337 --> 00:04:40,605
you're okay with that.


00:04:40,672 --> 00:04:42,641
I-I don't believe
the investigation


00:04:42,707 --> 00:04:44,142
should go
that way, Brian.


00:04:44,209 --> 00:04:46,178
I mean, roadblocks
and special ops?


00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,979
Oh, that's a pity,
'cause I do.


00:04:48,046 --> 00:04:49,114
Maybe you'll
feel different


00:04:49,181 --> 00:04:50,382
when you meet
Rick Culpepper.


00:04:50,448 --> 00:04:51,483
Sheriff Mobley.
Rick.


00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:52,517
Hi, Rick Culpepper.


00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:53,819
Federal Bureau
of Investigation.


00:04:53,885 --> 00:04:56,388
Gil Grissom,
Agent Culpepper.


00:04:56,454 --> 00:04:57,722
Uh, Special Agent.


00:04:57,789 --> 00:04:58,723
It's great
to meet you.


00:04:58,790 --> 00:04:59,891
All our kids
back in Quantico


00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:02,227
are always going on
about your bugs.


00:05:02,294 --> 00:05:03,829
Well, listen,
the FBI is here


00:05:03,895 --> 00:05:05,831
to help you
and your people at CSI.


00:05:05,897 --> 00:05:07,065
Of course, uh, as SAC


00:05:07,132 --> 00:05:09,267
the investigation
will run through me.


00:05:09,334 --> 00:05:11,536
Sheriff probably
already told you that.


00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:13,071
No, he didn't
mention that, either.


00:05:13,138 --> 00:05:15,273
All rivers
run through Rome


00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,374
so to speak.


00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:17,476
( <i>chuckling</i> )


00:05:17,542 --> 00:05:19,411
But, uh, you get an attaboy.


00:05:19,478 --> 00:05:20,545
Three women dead


00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:22,280
'cause you couldn't
get the job done.


00:05:22,347 --> 00:05:23,482
There's not many guys


00:05:23,548 --> 00:05:25,917
who would hand the case over
to us fibbies.


00:05:25,984 --> 00:05:27,419
I'm not handing it over.


00:05:27,486 --> 00:05:30,121
I'm willing to work
in conjunction with you.


00:05:30,188 --> 00:05:31,256
Well, that's fine.


00:05:31,323 --> 00:05:33,391
We'll work the Strip Strangler
case in conjunction.


00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,593
The what?


00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:36,495
He strangles them
near Las Vegas Boulevard


00:05:36,561 --> 00:05:37,729
then removes their clothes.


00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:39,097
Why, what
are you calling him?


00:05:39,164 --> 00:05:42,567
Unknown Signature Homicide,
Metropolitan Las Vegas.


00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:44,469
Oh. He's not kidding, is he?


00:05:44,536 --> 00:05:45,670
O'RILEY:
Excuse me.


00:05:45,737 --> 00:05:47,606
Guy over here's
got something


00:05:47,672 --> 00:05:48,707
you might want to hear.


00:05:48,773 --> 00:05:49,774
Syd Goggle.


00:05:49,841 --> 00:05:51,276
He's a security guard.


00:05:51,343 --> 00:05:52,477
Community patrol.


00:05:52,544 --> 00:05:55,647
Says he saw a man
speeding away from
here last night.


00:05:55,714 --> 00:05:56,648
Mr., uh, Goggle?


00:05:56,715 --> 00:05:57,649
Gil Grissom.


00:05:57,716 --> 00:05:58,917
I know who you are, sir.


00:05:58,984 --> 00:05:59,985
I've seen you on TV.


00:06:00,051 --> 00:06:01,253
Special Agent
Culpepper.


00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,488
You have information for us
about a man fleeing the scene?


00:06:03,555 --> 00:06:04,823
I didn't get his license.


00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:06,925
I didn't think of it
till this morning.


00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:10,295
He was really
burning rubber, though.


00:06:10,362 --> 00:06:12,364
Would you please
give Detective O'Riley
a full statement?


00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,299
If we have any more questions,
we'll get back to you.


00:06:14,366 --> 00:06:15,901
Listen, if you need any help


00:06:15,967 --> 00:06:18,003
in your investigation,
Mr. Grissom...


00:06:18,069 --> 00:06:20,305
The last time a security
guard tried to help me


00:06:20,372 --> 00:06:21,406
he ended up dead.


00:06:21,473 --> 00:06:22,974
But thank you.


00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:24,409
MAN:
This way.


00:06:25,911 --> 00:06:28,146
I'm late for an autopsy.


00:06:30,081 --> 00:06:31,683
He'll need a
little patience.


00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,785
Wouldn't respect him
if he didn't.


00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,022
What can you tell us?


00:06:37,088 --> 00:06:38,523
Nothing you don't know.


00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:41,059
Trauma to the head
with a blunt object.


00:06:41,126 --> 00:06:42,561
Overwhelmed her.

00:06:42,627 --> 00:06:45,497
He got a mixture
of sodium amytal in her.

00:06:45,564 --> 00:06:47,098
A hypnotic.

00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:52,170
Allowed him to control her
for up to six hours.

00:06:52,237 --> 00:06:53,371
Torture her.

00:06:53,438 --> 00:06:54,573
Look at the bruises.

00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:55,774
Purple means

00:06:55,841 --> 00:06:57,509
she was alive for all of it.

00:07:02,814 --> 00:07:03,949
Percussive control.

00:07:04,015 --> 00:07:05,517
He choked her
unconscious

00:07:05,584 --> 00:07:09,154
and then brought her to
multiple times.

00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:11,056
What about the rape?

00:07:11,122 --> 00:07:13,058
Same as the others:
indeterminate object

00:07:13,124 --> 00:07:14,860
caused severe
internal lacerations.

00:07:14,926 --> 00:07:17,863
I did find
a small trace of something

00:07:17,929 --> 00:07:19,798
creviced in the uterine wall.

00:07:19,865 --> 00:07:22,267
Looks like an everyday polymer
to me.

00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:30,208
Okay. I'll go back to the scene,
try to find something like it.

00:07:30,275 --> 00:07:31,209
Be careful, Nicky.

00:07:31,276 --> 00:07:33,145
The chilche's true.

00:07:33,211 --> 00:07:34,479
Signatures
return

00:07:34,546 --> 00:07:35,680
to their scenes.

00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:38,316
Will do.

00:07:38,383 --> 00:07:39,451
Are we done?

00:07:39,518 --> 00:07:42,587
Something we didn't find
with the other two women.

00:07:45,123 --> 00:07:46,658
Fibers.

00:07:46,725 --> 00:07:49,828
One in the back
of her throat.

00:07:49,895 --> 00:07:51,263
One stuck

00:07:51,329 --> 00:07:53,265
between her lower molars.

00:07:53,331 --> 00:07:55,400
This looks like cotton.

00:07:55,467 --> 00:07:57,169
Maybe terry cloth.

00:07:59,738 --> 00:08:02,607
Could be silencing
them with...

00:08:02,674 --> 00:08:03,942
white bath towels?

00:08:04,009 --> 00:08:05,510
Well,
it would explain

00:08:05,577 --> 00:08:07,579
why no one hears
the victim's screams.

00:08:07,646 --> 00:08:10,248
He brings it with him
and takes it away after.

00:08:10,315 --> 00:08:13,585
So, somewhere, there's evidence
of this victim on a towel.

00:08:13,652 --> 00:08:16,121
Kind of a forensic smoking gun.

00:08:16,188 --> 00:08:18,690
Mmm. Now we just
have to find the guy

00:08:18,757 --> 00:08:21,560
and hope that he hasn't
done his laundry.

00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:24,196
The semen taken from
this morning's homicide

00:08:24,262 --> 00:08:26,798
matches the semen taken
from the bedsheets

00:08:26,865 --> 00:08:28,633
of the last two
female victims.

00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,669
So, we're looking
at the same guy.

00:08:30,735 --> 00:08:32,237
Yeah, but,
check this out.

00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:33,605
The ejaculate sample.

00:08:34,673 --> 00:08:36,608
What's the red stuff?

00:08:36,675 --> 00:08:37,709
Mystery substance.

00:08:37,776 --> 00:08:38,877
Not blood?

00:08:38,944 --> 00:08:40,045
No.

00:08:40,111 --> 00:08:42,180
So, what, this guy's
got some strange chemical

00:08:42,247 --> 00:08:43,248
in his mutated DNA?

00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:45,317
Freaky, huh?

00:08:46,918 --> 00:08:49,488
Freakiest semen
I've seen in a while.

00:08:49,554 --> 00:08:50,722
Call me.

00:08:50,789 --> 00:08:51,756
Oh.

00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:52,924
Catherine, you busy?

00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,961
I was hoping we might be able
to talk about a few things.

00:08:56,027 --> 00:08:57,262
Pertaining to the case?

00:08:57,329 --> 00:08:58,797
As a jumping-off point.

00:08:58,864 --> 00:09:02,000
Well, Sheriff,
I'd say let's
go to my office

00:09:02,067 --> 00:09:03,635
but I don't have one.

00:09:03,702 --> 00:09:06,371
Well, that's just
the sort of thing

00:09:06,438 --> 00:09:08,907
I was hoping we would discuss.

00:09:11,409 --> 00:09:12,978
Hey, Warrick

00:09:13,044 --> 00:09:14,246
you got a second?

00:09:14,312 --> 00:09:15,447
What's up?

00:09:15,514 --> 00:09:18,483
I got this hair
that Catherine
found this morning

00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,584
and I'm trying

00:09:19,651 --> 00:09:21,353
to compare it to the one hair
we recovered

00:09:21,419 --> 00:09:23,255
from the murder last week--
the Hayes girl?

00:09:23,321 --> 00:09:24,689
And you got a match
microscopically

00:09:24,756 --> 00:09:26,024
but it doesn't mean
a damn thing

00:09:26,091 --> 00:09:27,826
'cause it still
doesn't lead us to the guy?

00:09:27,893 --> 00:09:30,629
No. I can't even tell
if we have a DNA match.

00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,764
There's no skin tag
on either one.

00:09:32,831 --> 00:09:33,865
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:09:33,932 --> 00:09:35,534
A girl defending herself
against a guy

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,502
is going to pull that hair out
by the roots.

00:09:37,569 --> 00:09:40,806
I mean, you get scalp skin
filled with DNA.

00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:42,607
No scalp, no skin.

00:09:42,674 --> 00:09:45,710
It's almost like
this hair was...

00:09:45,777 --> 00:09:47,179
Shed?

00:09:47,245 --> 00:09:48,313
( <i>beeping</i> )

00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,881
Mine.

00:09:49,948 --> 00:09:51,550
Mine.

00:09:52,918 --> 00:09:54,719
Hey, Gil, you want
to give me the skinny

00:09:54,786 --> 00:09:55,854
on this meeting
of yours?

00:09:55,921 --> 00:09:57,656
I'm on my way back
to the crime scene.

00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:58,690
What meeting?

00:09:58,757 --> 00:09:59,791
I'm going to Evidence.

00:09:59,858 --> 00:10:01,660
I got paged
about the signature case.

00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,462
Hey, Warrick and
I just got a break.

00:10:03,528 --> 00:10:04,963
The guy's been
planting hairs.

00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,865
Shedding. He's trying
to throw us off.

00:10:06,932 --> 00:10:09,434
What he doesn't realize,
we got no DNA on the hairs

00:10:09,501 --> 00:10:10,569
so we can't chase down

00:10:10,635 --> 00:10:12,103
his other suspect.

00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:13,305
Grissom...

00:10:13,371 --> 00:10:14,906
are you hearing us?

00:10:24,883 --> 00:10:26,585
You all got my page. Good.

00:10:26,651 --> 00:10:27,919
I didn't.

00:10:27,986 --> 00:10:29,187
We'll get you a new battery.

00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:31,656
I thought we'd convo
about the strangler.

00:10:31,723 --> 00:10:32,691
Hear what you've got

00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:34,726
tell you what we think
our next move should be.

00:10:36,394 --> 00:10:37,863
Would you guys go back

00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:39,097
to my office, please?

00:10:39,164 --> 00:10:40,866
I'll be in in a few minutes.

00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:47,038
I'll be happy
to pass on

00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:49,541
any pertinent information
you may have to my team.

00:10:49,608 --> 00:10:50,609
Okay. Fine.

00:10:50,675 --> 00:10:52,878
Got anything to report to us?

00:10:56,348 --> 00:10:57,916
You first.

00:10:57,983 --> 00:11:01,319
Okay. We have an operation
in place.

00:11:01,386 --> 00:11:02,787
Your CSI, Sidle

00:11:02,854 --> 00:11:05,190
has expressed
an interest to my agents

00:11:05,257 --> 00:11:06,291
in availing herself.

00:11:06,358 --> 00:11:07,425
I wanted to let you know

00:11:07,492 --> 00:11:09,060
before we made
the official offer.

00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:11,963
Really? What kind of operation?

00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:14,966
All this talk about your great
capacity for observation.

00:11:15,033 --> 00:11:17,636
Sara Sidle matches
the victim prototype to a "T."

00:11:17,702 --> 00:11:20,505
She's a young woman,
brunette, tall for a female.

00:11:24,042 --> 00:11:26,111
You're not serious.

00:11:26,178 --> 00:11:27,445
And by all reports,
she's steady.

00:11:27,512 --> 00:11:29,414
Has the right personality
for a decoy operation.

00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:32,851
You're going to bait this guy
with a human being?

00:11:32,918 --> 00:11:34,753
This is your big FBI plan?

00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,489
Before he kills again, yes.

00:11:37,556 --> 00:11:39,324
Got a better idea?

00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:41,092
Understanding him
first, completely

00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,928
so that we can get
out ahead of him.

00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:43,995
And if
he kills again

00:11:44,062 --> 00:11:46,164
while we're trying
to understand him?

00:11:46,231 --> 00:11:48,600
Well, I'm sorry, but he's
not going to kill my CSI.

00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:50,469
I'm going to do it, Grissom.
I want to.

00:11:50,535 --> 00:11:52,471
You want to put
yourself in the path

00:11:52,537 --> 00:11:53,738
of a psychotic killer?

00:11:53,805 --> 00:11:55,941
I'm trained
in weaponless defense.

00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:58,043
Too bad, because that's
what turns him on--

00:11:58,109 --> 00:11:59,144
women fighting back.

00:11:59,211 --> 00:12:00,679
Gives him a greater
sense of power

00:12:00,745 --> 00:12:02,180
when he makes
his final kill.

00:12:02,247 --> 00:12:04,149
Grissom...
Sit down, Sara.

00:12:10,889 --> 00:12:13,992
Okay. If we're to follow
your line of thinking

00:12:14,059 --> 00:12:15,760
are you out ahead of him?

00:12:15,827 --> 00:12:16,928
Not yet.

00:12:16,995 --> 00:12:18,997
He knows just enough
about forensics

00:12:19,064 --> 00:12:20,298
to be dangerous.

00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:22,300
He thinks
he's throwing us off track

00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:24,002
by planting confederate hairs.

00:12:24,069 --> 00:12:25,570
He probably shaves his head

00:12:25,637 --> 00:12:27,806
maybe his entire body
as DNA protection.

00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:29,307
He may gag
his victims

00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:31,710
using a garden-
variety bath towel

00:12:31,776 --> 00:12:35,080
which he then takes with him
as part of his murder kit.

00:12:35,147 --> 00:12:37,382
He will go after
another tall brunette

00:12:37,449 --> 00:12:39,284
and the torture will be worse.

00:12:39,351 --> 00:12:41,353
But this time,
he won't ejaculate.

00:12:41,419 --> 00:12:42,587
At least not
at the scene.

00:12:42,654 --> 00:12:43,889
At home, later.

00:12:43,955 --> 00:12:44,990
Learning control.

00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:47,325
Think he knows his next victim?

00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:49,761
Signature killers
always know their next victim.

00:12:49,828 --> 00:12:50,962
But they don't know him

00:12:51,029 --> 00:12:54,065
until he tortures,
rapes and kills them.

00:13:59,282 --> 00:14:00,984
( <i>faint creaking</i> )

00:14:23,157 --> 00:14:24,091
( <i>screaming</i> )

00:14:24,158 --> 00:14:24,589
Freeze!

00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:25,890
Hey.

00:14:25,957 --> 00:14:27,558
Get out of there.

00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,127
Get out of the closet.

00:14:29,193 --> 00:14:30,161
Hmm.

00:14:30,228 --> 00:14:30,962
What are you doing?

00:14:31,028 --> 00:14:31,696
Um, I a reporter.
What?

00:14:31,763 --> 00:14:33,231
We know the police
are withholding

00:14:33,297 --> 00:14:35,733
information from us,
so I came down here because...

00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,502
Are you out of your mind?
I could've killed you.

00:14:37,568 --> 00:14:39,670
This a crime scene.
You don't belong here.

00:14:39,737 --> 00:14:41,672
Unless you want me to get
the cop at the front door

00:14:41,739 --> 00:14:43,274
you'll get out of here now.

00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:45,376
And I'd better not
see any pictures
of this apartment

00:14:45,443 --> 00:14:46,677
in your paper...

00:14:46,744 --> 00:14:48,746
or I'll have the D.A.
on your front door.

00:14:48,813 --> 00:14:50,348
I'm sorry that I scared you.

00:14:50,415 --> 00:14:52,583
You didn't scare me.
Mm-mm.

00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:55,086
Want to tell me what you found
over by the window?

00:14:55,153 --> 00:14:56,287
No.

00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:57,955
( <i>softly</i> ):
Okay.

00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:06,264
Fast.

00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:08,032
I'm impressed.

00:15:08,099 --> 00:15:10,101
You got a hot dog?

00:15:10,168 --> 00:15:11,869
This one of your jokes, Greg?

00:15:11,936 --> 00:15:13,271
I got the ketchup.

00:15:13,337 --> 00:15:14,939
I'm sure this is meaningful.

00:15:15,006 --> 00:15:16,374
I went back
and looked at

00:15:16,441 --> 00:15:18,476
the ejaculate from the last
two murders.

00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:19,477
The same thing.

00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:21,946
"Indeterminate red stuff."

00:15:22,013 --> 00:15:23,281
It's C12, H22

00:15:23,347 --> 00:15:25,917
and O11, NaCl, H2O

00:15:25,983 --> 00:15:27,552
and tomato paste.

00:15:27,618 --> 00:15:31,656
Sugar, water, salt
and tomato paste.

00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:32,890
Ketchup?

00:15:32,957 --> 00:15:33,891
Ketchup.

00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:34,959
Well, does he

00:15:35,026 --> 00:15:38,396
add it after or is it organic?

00:15:38,463 --> 00:15:41,099
Don't ask me why, but, uh...

00:15:41,165 --> 00:15:43,134
he adds it.

00:15:43,201 --> 00:15:47,305
I was expecting something
a little more elemental.

00:15:47,371 --> 00:15:49,640
When we zig, he zags.

00:15:49,707 --> 00:15:51,642
Yeah, well, he's not
as smart as he thinks,
you know?

00:15:51,709 --> 00:15:54,612
I mean, ketchup is not going
to mask the DNA in his semen.

00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:57,915
All of which I'm sure
you'll share with the FBI.

00:15:57,982 --> 00:15:59,517
I'm sure.

00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:00,651
Hey...

00:16:00,718 --> 00:16:02,720
is it so bad to avail our lab

00:16:02,787 --> 00:16:05,757
to the resources
of the federal government?

00:16:05,823 --> 00:16:09,026
You've been to talking
to our sheriff.

00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,928
I've been listening
to our sheriff.

00:16:10,995 --> 00:16:12,697
He says that you won't.

00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:13,865
Yeah, yeah, I know.

00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,032
And if I don't shape up

00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:17,201
he going to have Ecklie
take over the case.

00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:18,436
No, he prefers

00:16:18,503 --> 00:16:20,638
someone from night shift

00:16:20,705 --> 00:16:24,108
and it may be more
than just this case.

00:16:26,043 --> 00:16:27,945
Ah.

00:16:28,012 --> 00:16:31,516
Now that the trees are gone,
I can almost see the forest.

00:16:31,582 --> 00:16:32,850
Gil...

00:16:32,917 --> 00:16:36,287
learn to be more politic.

00:16:36,354 --> 00:16:38,189
( <i>knocking on door</i> )

00:16:38,256 --> 00:16:40,091
You guys got a sec?

00:16:40,158 --> 00:16:42,093
He's wearing latex gloves.

00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,162
The thick kind, too.
He must know

00:16:44,228 --> 00:16:45,730
the thin ones
leave prints.

00:16:48,099 --> 00:16:50,668
When we zig,
he zags.

00:16:50,735 --> 00:16:53,137
BRASS:
What about Paul Millander?

00:16:53,204 --> 00:16:55,440
Maybe he's our guy.

00:16:55,506 --> 00:16:58,176
And, uh, he had
the latex hands.

00:16:58,242 --> 00:16:59,410
And he's a serial.

00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:01,879
Millander stages suicides
in bathtubs

00:17:01,946 --> 00:17:03,414
with paternal figures.

00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:05,416
This guy's signature
is overkill rage

00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:06,818
against young women.

00:17:06,884 --> 00:17:08,152
It's completely different.

00:17:08,219 --> 00:17:09,420
Maybe our brethren at the FBI

00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:10,888
have some sort
of special database.

00:17:10,955 --> 00:17:13,758
When did you become friendly
with the feds?

00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:15,727
I didn't think you had that
in you.

00:17:15,793 --> 00:17:18,730
Never make an enemy when you can
just as easily make a friend.

00:17:18,796 --> 00:17:22,300
FBI's okay.
I've kissed
worse ass.

00:17:22,366 --> 00:17:23,768
But I've got to say

00:17:23,835 --> 00:17:26,270
I don't like this decoy op
the feds are talking up.

00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:28,906
I remember when
Holly Gribbs died.

00:17:28,973 --> 00:17:31,609
I sent her out in the field
and she wasn't ready.

00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:35,179
I told Culpepper
that he could not have Sara.

00:17:35,246 --> 00:17:36,881
I know what you told him.

00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,352
CULPEPPER:
Okay, listen up.

00:17:41,419 --> 00:17:44,689
All personnel will be
tethered to our decoy
by this radio.

00:17:44,756 --> 00:17:46,591
According to
Captain James Brass

00:17:46,657 --> 00:17:49,427
two of our assailant's
victims patronized this
specialty grocery store

00:17:49,494 --> 00:17:51,729
to which we are about
to embark forthwith

00:17:51,796 --> 00:17:54,365
two days before they
turned up dead.

00:17:54,432 --> 00:17:55,933
There's a very good chance
our assailant

00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,202
will refrequent this store,
looking for his next victim.

00:17:58,269 --> 00:17:59,704
This is a pretty flimsy excuse

00:17:59,771 --> 00:18:02,206
to get your circus up
and running, don't you think?

00:18:02,273 --> 00:18:04,442
Lives are at stake.
I'll take flimsy over nothing.

00:18:04,509 --> 00:18:06,144
This is action
for action's sake

00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,145
Culpepper.

00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,980
You're risking my CSI's life.

00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:12,150
SIDLE:
Look, this
is my idea.

00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:15,620
I want to do something
before another girl
gets killed and...

00:18:15,686 --> 00:18:17,021
Listen to me, Sara.

00:18:17,088 --> 00:18:20,057
If we study his past,
we can predict his future.

00:18:20,124 --> 00:18:21,726
You've been saying
that for weeks.

00:18:21,793 --> 00:18:23,461
It's taking too long.

00:18:23,528 --> 00:18:24,729
Someone else is going to die

00:18:24,796 --> 00:18:26,731
and you're still going
to be figuring it out.

00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:27,932
CULPEPPER:
Sidle

00:18:27,999 --> 00:18:29,167
we're good to go.

00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,069
Wish me luck.

( <i>clears throat</i> )

00:19:15,146 --> 00:19:18,449
Maybe we should reposition
over at that Borders Book Store.

00:19:18,516 --> 00:19:20,418
Gets a lot of foot traffic
in there

00:19:20,485 --> 00:19:22,186

That guy's coming back.

00:19:53,251 --> 00:19:55,653
Would you happen to
have a cigarette?

00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:59,123
Uh... yeah, actually.

00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:01,092
Culpepper...
Let her play.

00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:03,661
I've been trying to quit.
Didn't want to buy a pack.

00:20:03,728 --> 00:20:04,662
Me, too.

00:20:04,729 --> 00:20:06,030
This is my last pack...

00:20:06,097 --> 00:20:08,933
but, uh, I say that
every week, so...

00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:13,971
Nonfiltered.
The women I know

00:20:14,038 --> 00:20:15,440
smoke filtered-- you know

00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:16,774
those long, skinny cigarettes?

00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:18,543
Guess it depends on the woman.

00:20:18,609 --> 00:20:20,511
Guess it does.

00:20:20,578 --> 00:20:21,679
You got a light?

00:20:21,746 --> 00:20:23,614
Sure. Yeah.

00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:27,151
You live around here?

00:20:27,218 --> 00:20:28,953
Maybe.

00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,589
I don't usually give out
that kind of information.

00:20:31,656 --> 00:20:32,824
It's probably smart.

00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:34,358
I wouldn't tell me either.

00:20:36,461 --> 00:20:38,596
You're cute.

00:20:38,663 --> 00:20:39,764
Thanks.

00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,935
All right, we're on the move.
Let's go.

OFFICER:
Don't move!

00:20:52,009 --> 00:20:53,377
I'll give it back. Here.

00:20:57,181 --> 00:20:59,350
( <i>cell phone ringing</i> )

00:20:59,417 --> 00:21:01,319
Yeah, Culpepper.

00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:03,154
Time and coordinate?

00:21:03,221 --> 00:21:04,589
Yeah, will do.

00:21:04,655 --> 00:21:05,790
All right, gentlemen

00:21:05,857 --> 00:21:07,024
nothing ventured,
nothing gained.

00:21:07,091 --> 00:21:08,259
I do not believe
this is our man.

00:21:08,326 --> 00:21:09,827
What was your first clue?

00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:11,329
Murder at the Monaco Hotel.

00:21:11,396 --> 00:21:12,897
Woman found bound in her room

00:21:12,964 --> 00:21:14,966
stripped and strangled.

00:21:19,804 --> 00:21:22,173
He met the profile.

00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,943
Sometimes the harder thing
to do is to do nothing.

00:21:45,613 --> 00:21:49,950
Starting to look like
deja vu all over again.

00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,952
Hmm.

00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,320
Not?

00:21:53,387 --> 00:21:58,659
Occasionally I'm struck
by the absence of evidence.

00:21:58,726 --> 00:22:01,128
It's there
or it isn't.

00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:04,331
The lamp--
cord's still attached.

00:22:04,398 --> 00:22:06,700
All the others,
he yanked the cords off.

00:22:06,767 --> 00:22:09,770
Look at the table.
Books aren't even disturbed.

00:22:09,837 --> 00:22:11,238
Staged?

00:22:11,305 --> 00:22:15,242
First time in a hotel?

00:22:15,309 --> 00:22:18,512
First time he didn't come
in through the window?

00:22:18,579 --> 00:22:21,582
I don't think he made
a deposit... either.

00:22:21,649 --> 00:22:23,317
That just means his
signature's evolving

00:22:23,384 --> 00:22:25,352
isn't that
right, Grissom?

00:22:25,419 --> 00:22:26,954
Who's that guy?

00:22:27,021 --> 00:22:28,455
BRASS:
He's the husband.

00:22:28,522 --> 00:22:29,957
His name's Brad Walden.

00:22:30,024 --> 00:22:31,792
They're locals, come here
a couple times a year.

00:22:31,859 --> 00:22:33,627
He was downstairs
playing poker.

00:22:33,694 --> 00:22:35,729
She was up here reading
a romance novel.

00:22:35,796 --> 00:22:37,498
He comes back
five grand richer.

00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:38,899
He finds her like this.

00:22:38,966 --> 00:22:41,635
Husband?

00:22:41,702 --> 00:22:43,170
Let's bring him in.

00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:44,972
I'll transport
the witness.

00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,041
Witness?

00:22:47,107 --> 00:22:49,243
Suspect.

00:22:51,545 --> 00:22:53,080
What did you get?

00:22:53,147 --> 00:22:56,617
I posted the lady from
the hotel, and I have to say

00:22:56,684 --> 00:23:00,621
it's the same menu as the last
three-- chemical restraint

00:23:00,688 --> 00:23:03,190
overligature,
death by strangulation.

00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:06,894
What about the object-rape?
Indeterminate polymer?

00:23:06,961 --> 00:23:08,229
No, this one's different.

00:23:08,295 --> 00:23:09,897
Different how?

00:23:09,964 --> 00:23:14,268
DR. ROBBINS:
Cross-hatched leather, with
tiny air holes for breathing.

00:23:16,303 --> 00:23:22,076
I was thinking driving gloves,
or weightlifting gloves, or...

00:23:24,912 --> 00:23:27,548
I'm not accusing you of
anything, but a man and his wife

00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:29,049
get a hotel room
for a romantic weekend

00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,517
then spend
that whole weekend apart--

00:23:30,584 --> 00:23:32,553
makes me wonder if there's
trouble in the marriage.

00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:36,490
I like... to gamble.
She liked to read.

00:23:36,557 --> 00:23:38,459
It was, you know...

00:23:38,525 --> 00:23:40,427
just the perfect
getaway.

00:23:40,494 --> 00:23:42,763
You liked to play golf, too.

00:23:44,331 --> 00:23:46,133
These are your golf clubs.

00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,469
We found them
in your hotel room.

00:23:48,535 --> 00:23:52,573
I prefer a titanium
driver, Mr. Walden.

00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,844
I'd like to see what you use,
but your carrier is locked.

00:23:56,911 --> 00:24:00,548
Yeah, I have a key on my
keychain... my car keys.

00:24:00,614 --> 00:24:02,483
So you won't mind
opening it, though?

00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:05,953
No...

00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:09,256
Uh, uh, w-why?

00:24:09,323 --> 00:24:12,893
Well, so I can see if the
leather on your club handles

00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,228
matches the leather

00:24:14,295 --> 00:24:17,131
from the object used
to violate your wife.

00:24:25,873 --> 00:24:31,645
Well, I-I, you know,
if it does... I read
that this, uh...

00:24:31,712 --> 00:24:34,815
this, uh, you know,
character

00:24:34,882 --> 00:24:37,985
uses whatever is
at the scene of
the crime for, uh...

00:24:38,052 --> 00:24:41,155
for killing his victims.

00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:44,358
Well, if this character...

00:24:44,425 --> 00:24:46,293
killed your wife?

00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:51,532
How did he get your clubs out
of the case without the keys?

00:24:54,001 --> 00:24:55,236
Or, for that matter

00:24:55,302 --> 00:24:58,372
back into the case
after he killed your wife?

00:25:17,858 --> 00:25:19,827
Read this man
his rights, please.

00:25:19,894 --> 00:25:21,061
You're under arrest

00:25:21,128 --> 00:25:23,964
for the murder
of Jennifer Walden...

00:25:24,031 --> 00:25:26,533
and Eileen Snow,
and Tracy Berg, and...

00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,870
Can I have a word with you
outside... please?

00:25:31,906 --> 00:25:34,208
You can't charge him
for the other women.

00:25:34,275 --> 00:25:35,209
What do you mean?

00:25:35,276 --> 00:25:37,177
For the murder
of his wife, maybe

00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:39,847
but I am certain that
he didn't do the others.

00:25:39,914 --> 00:25:41,615
Every piece of the
signature is there.

00:25:41,682 --> 00:25:42,816
He read the papers--

00:25:42,883 --> 00:25:44,385
he piggybacked on
top of the killer.

00:25:44,451 --> 00:25:46,053
For what possible reason?

00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:49,390
Who knows? Convenient way
out of a lousy marriage?
He's not our guy.

00:25:50,057 --> 00:25:52,693
You know, this is where I like
to reference the majesty

00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:56,030
and the power of the Republic
of the United States of America.

00:25:56,097 --> 00:25:57,098
Go ahead. Pull rank.

00:25:57,165 --> 00:25:59,100
But that hotel crime
scene was staged

00:25:59,167 --> 00:26:00,635
to look like
the Signature's.

00:26:00,701 --> 00:26:02,236
And that golfer
just got lucky

00:26:02,303 --> 00:26:05,506
that the victim type fits his
wife to a Texas T, is that it?

00:26:05,573 --> 00:26:08,743
If you stop and think,
you'll see it.

00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:11,012
Duly noted, Supervisor Grissom.

00:26:12,046 --> 00:26:14,782
Duly noted.

00:26:18,219 --> 00:26:21,055
Details of the arrest will be
forthcoming in this live report.

00:26:21,122 --> 00:26:25,259
Federal Agent Culpepper is about
to start his news conference.

00:26:25,326 --> 00:26:27,762
As we've been reporting,
a suspect has been arrested

00:26:27,829 --> 00:26:30,231
in the Strip-Strangler case.

00:26:30,298 --> 00:26:33,601
We believe that Bradley Mac
Walden not only killed his wife

00:26:33,668 --> 00:26:36,571
but also took the lives of
Audrey Hayes and Eileen Snow

00:26:36,637 --> 00:26:37,738
and Tracy Berg.

00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:40,808
Our field agents have divulged
that Mr. Walden

00:26:40,875 --> 00:26:43,277
lived within two miles
of the other victims

00:26:43,344 --> 00:26:45,646
worked in the same office
building as Ms. Snow

00:26:45,713 --> 00:26:48,316
and has no believable
explanation for his whereabouts

00:26:48,382 --> 00:26:49,884
on the dates of their murders.

00:26:49,951 --> 00:26:52,320
We believe that
Bradley Mac Walden

00:26:52,386 --> 00:26:54,789
found and stalked these
victims, and...

00:26:54,856 --> 00:26:57,124
I just talked
with Brass.

00:26:57,191 --> 00:27:00,795
He said that Walden
was having an affair

00:27:00,862 --> 00:27:03,431
with a dentist
in his office.

00:27:03,498 --> 00:27:07,034
I'm telling you, this guy did
not kill those other women.

00:27:08,803 --> 00:27:10,905
This statement is concluded.

00:27:10,972 --> 00:27:12,573
Las Vegas, its locals

00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,110
and visitors can rest
a little easier tonight.

00:27:16,177 --> 00:27:18,079
A suspect is
in custody.

00:27:18,146 --> 00:27:20,581
Thank you.
I'll take some questions.

00:27:20,648 --> 00:27:23,251
Mr. Grissom-- Linda Darby,
<i>Las Vegas Tribune.</i>

00:27:23,317 --> 00:27:25,253
As the lead CSI on this case

00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:27,121
do you have anything to add
to the FBI statement?

00:27:27,188 --> 00:27:28,956
Politics...

00:27:32,026 --> 00:27:33,361
No.

00:27:33,427 --> 00:27:36,030
So, Las Vegas can
breathe easier?

00:27:36,097 --> 00:27:38,966
You do have the Strip
Strangler behind bars?

00:27:40,001 --> 00:27:42,970
No, we don't.

00:27:51,846 --> 00:27:54,248
SHERIFF:
The FBI did me
a favor being here

00:27:54,315 --> 00:27:56,050
and they have a viable suspect.

00:27:56,117 --> 00:27:57,251
He's not viable, Brian.

00:27:57,318 --> 00:27:59,654
Then further investigation
will prove that out.

00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,688
In the meantime

00:28:00,755 --> 00:28:03,191
people will feel better
about their daily lives.

00:28:03,257 --> 00:28:05,927
Now, why on Earth would you
want to counteract that?

00:28:05,993 --> 00:28:08,896
For those who have to ask,
no answer could suffice.

00:28:08,963 --> 00:28:12,366
Look, I see we've
come to an impasse.

00:28:12,433 --> 00:28:14,101
If further investigation
determines

00:28:14,168 --> 00:28:16,204
that Walden didn't kill
those other women

00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:19,473
then you can rejoin
the investigation.

00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:22,043
Oh, do I get the weekend off?

00:28:22,109 --> 00:28:23,344
For starters...

00:28:23,411 --> 00:28:27,248
and a two-week holiday...
anywhere but CSI.

00:28:27,315 --> 00:28:29,484
You brought this
on yourself.

00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:32,220
Now, the next time you want
to play with my career

00:28:32,286 --> 00:28:33,688
maybe you'll think twice.

00:28:41,829 --> 00:28:44,298
You know, it's
not fair, Grissom.

00:28:44,365 --> 00:28:47,869
You know more about
signatures than most
of them put together.

00:28:47,935 --> 00:28:49,637
That may have been
the problem.

00:28:49,704 --> 00:28:51,405
Is there's no one
you can appeal to?

00:28:51,472 --> 00:28:54,942
No... I'm off.

00:28:55,009 --> 00:28:58,746
Come on, this guy's on the loose
and there's nothing you can do?

00:28:58,813 --> 00:29:01,115
It's all Catherine.
She's the boss.

00:29:03,151 --> 00:29:05,853
Good luck.

You okay?

00:30:58,833 --> 00:31:01,002
I get them about
once a year.

I'm not used to having
people in my house.

00:31:04,372 --> 00:31:07,241
You just don't like it
when you can't solve a case

00:31:07,308 --> 00:31:08,576
or command your troops.

Did you come here to tell me
about your new job?

00:31:14,115 --> 00:31:16,083
I told the Sheriff I'd pass.

00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:19,587
You don't want to be
a Supervisor?

00:31:19,654 --> 00:31:23,457
Well, if I get a promotion,
I want it to be on merit...

00:31:23,524 --> 00:31:26,861
not because you're
politically tone-deaf.

00:31:28,963 --> 00:31:31,098
So, our guys are outside
in their Tahoes.

00:31:31,165 --> 00:31:32,834
If you're a civilian, we are.

00:31:34,869 --> 00:31:37,738
Except we are putting in
for overtime.

00:31:44,664 --> 00:31:46,165
We should reexamine
each victim--

00:31:46,232 --> 00:31:47,200
all the evidence

00:31:47,266 --> 00:31:48,768
pertaining to each one
individually.

00:31:48,835 --> 00:31:50,837
All right, well,
I got dibs on Eileen Snow.

00:31:50,903 --> 00:31:52,171
And I have a strong feeling

00:31:52,238 --> 00:31:54,207
I'm going to be the one
to break the case.

00:31:54,273 --> 00:31:55,708
Tracy Berg.

00:31:55,775 --> 00:31:58,477
I got Audrey Hayes,
but those fibers
we found in

00:31:58,544 --> 00:32:00,813
the Snow lady's throat aren't
going to give us anything.

00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,814
White cotton fibers

00:32:01,881 --> 00:32:03,449
are like oxygen--
they're everywhere.

00:32:03,516 --> 00:32:05,184
Well, then go back
to your crime scenes

00:32:05,251 --> 00:32:06,853
and look for a persistence
of fibers.

Yeah, well, don't act
like it's so simple.

This guy could have
gone another year
without being picked up.

What did they get him on?

00:32:29,775 --> 00:32:31,143

I'm sorry, I'm working.

Uh-uh.

You recognize any
of these women?

00:33:19,592 --> 00:33:20,760
Yeah.

00:33:20,827 --> 00:33:22,728
Strip Strangler girls.

They are all over TV.

00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:26,199

I don't know.

Yeah, "I don't know"
doesn't get it, pal.

DNA's like fingerprints.

No two samples are alike.

the last place

00:33:41,314 --> 00:33:44,250
that you will find me
is in a woman's bedroom.

Unless we're discussing

Hey, and my indecent was
for tricking too close

00:33:48,554 --> 00:33:50,056

Would you be able to recognize
any of these guys?

Well, I'd have to be looking
at them in the face

00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:13,112
now, wouldn't I?

( <i>Willows clears throat</i> )

00:34:16,048 --> 00:34:17,183

00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:18,484
if our guy was
planting hairs

00:34:18,551 --> 00:34:20,586
he was planting semen.

00:34:20,653 --> 00:34:24,423
Yeah. Probably in little
hollowed-out packets of ketchup.

to Audrey Hayes' apartment

00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:32,665
and I paid particular attention
to the point of entry.

00:34:32,732 --> 00:34:36,068
I found a small persistence
of white cotton fibers.

00:34:41,607 --> 00:34:44,143
Could have been
the staging area.

what you said about
signature guys

00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,722
and how they have
low self-esteem.

00:34:56,789 --> 00:34:59,325
They're always going
to the gym to work out

00:34:59,392 --> 00:35:00,860
so I'm thinking gym towels.

spotted them.

00:35:06,666 --> 00:35:07,600
I went back to see

00:35:07,667 --> 00:35:09,969
if any of them had tried
out introductory offers.

00:35:10,036 --> 00:35:11,204
Which I do all the time.

00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:14,006
It's a free workout,
and you don't have to sign up.

00:35:14,073 --> 00:35:16,075
But you do have
to sign in.

00:35:16,142 --> 00:35:17,677
All three women

00:35:17,743 --> 00:35:20,413

in the last three months.

00:35:22,481 --> 00:35:24,283
So, I'm going back there,
grab some towels

00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:25,885
bring them back to the lab

00:35:25,952 --> 00:35:28,588
see if I can get
a match from the
crime scene fibers.

00:35:28,654 --> 00:35:31,657
And, of course, get a list
of the club's male gym members.

00:35:31,724 --> 00:35:33,759
Call Brass, tell him
to meet you guys there.

00:35:33,826 --> 00:35:35,161

he saw a guy burn rubber

out of there the night
of Eileen's murder.

00:35:50,776 --> 00:35:52,378
I remember that guy.

00:35:52,445 --> 00:35:54,313
Yeah, well,
there's no rubber here.

And I called Brass.

00:35:59,886 --> 00:36:01,954
Nobody took any photographs
of any tire marks.

00:36:02,021 --> 00:36:03,456
Not the Las Vegas PD.

00:36:03,523 --> 00:36:04,690

00:40:17,043 --> 00:40:20,780
Stuffing club towels down
their throat make your point?

00:40:23,549 --> 00:40:25,618
You know,
the thing with women...

00:40:29,121 --> 00:40:31,791
is they work out

00:40:31,858 --> 00:40:34,861
because they want us
to look at them.

00:40:34,927 --> 00:40:37,163
And then they...

00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:39,332
parade around.

00:40:39,398 --> 00:40:41,868
And you just want to...

00:40:48,508 --> 00:40:50,710
Say hello.

00:40:52,545 --> 00:40:54,580
Everybody knows

00:40:54,647 --> 00:40:56,883
white cotton fibers aren't
like fingerprints.

00:40:56,949 --> 00:40:59,352
They can't be traced.

00:40:59,418 --> 00:41:02,221
You don't get a... match

00:41:02,288 --> 00:41:03,589
on a towel.

00:41:03,656 --> 00:41:05,591
In theory.

00:41:05,658 --> 00:41:07,260
But the truth is

00:41:07,326 --> 00:41:09,729
every object is changed
by its owner.

00:41:09,795 --> 00:41:12,431
By his habits.

00:41:12,498 --> 00:41:16,335
His... washing machine,
for instance.

00:41:16,402 --> 00:41:18,671
His detergent.

00:41:20,706 --> 00:41:22,808
The totality of

00:41:22,875 --> 00:41:25,912
microscopic elements.

00:41:25,978 --> 00:41:28,447
It's Locard's Theory.

00:41:29,482 --> 00:41:31,417
( <i>washing machine banging</i> )

00:41:31,484 --> 00:41:34,120
Your towel is caught
in the agitator.

00:41:36,055 --> 00:41:38,057
Now, see, that's going
to leave distinctive marks

00:41:38,124 --> 00:41:40,159
on the fabric, Syd.

00:41:41,194 --> 00:41:43,095
And that's just
the beginning.

00:41:43,162 --> 00:41:45,164
I've had a look
at your garbage.

00:41:45,231 --> 00:41:48,367
You were in my apartment.

00:41:50,436 --> 00:41:53,673
No, nothing from there's
admissible in court.

00:41:53,739 --> 00:41:55,675
Your garbage is
in a public area.

00:41:55,741 --> 00:41:57,677
Plain sight.

00:41:59,512 --> 00:42:02,148
It's enough for me
to get a warrant.

00:42:10,122 --> 00:42:12,859
( <i>gunfire</i> )

00:42:18,831 --> 00:42:20,666
You all right?

00:42:22,602 --> 00:42:24,604
Yeah.

00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,242
How did you know I was here?

00:42:29,308 --> 00:42:31,811
Nick told me.

00:42:32,845 --> 00:42:34,981
Everybody okay?

00:42:36,349 --> 00:42:37,750
Special Agents,
we got a shooting.

00:42:37,817 --> 00:42:40,520
Notify LVPD and
paramedics ASAP.

00:42:50,496 --> 00:42:52,698
I just wanted to talk to him.

00:42:55,234 --> 00:42:58,838
We can say unequivocally,
based on statements made

00:42:58,905 --> 00:43:01,941
by a certain local
law enforcement employee

00:43:02,008 --> 00:43:03,910
and corresponding evidence

00:43:03,976 --> 00:43:06,546
that the deceased,
Syd Booth Goggle

00:43:06,612 --> 00:43:08,481
is the Strip Strangler.

00:43:08,548 --> 00:43:11,450
Furthermore, since Goggle
was killed

00:43:11,517 --> 00:43:14,320
by a second member
of Las Vegas law enforcement

00:43:14,387 --> 00:43:17,290
during his apprehension,
this case is now closed.

00:43:17,356 --> 00:43:20,693
I would like to thank the FBI,
along with Special Agent

00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,862
Rick Culpepper
for his invaluable leadership

00:43:22,929 --> 00:43:24,197
in this pursuit.

00:43:24,263 --> 00:43:26,566
In short, we couldn't
have done it without you.

00:43:26,632 --> 00:43:31,404
I'd like to thank you, Sheriff,
Las Vegas Police.

00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:34,273
I'd also like to thank
the citizens of Las Vegas

00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:36,409
for their courage.

00:43:36,475 --> 00:43:38,477
We at the Federal Bureau
of Investigation

00:43:38,544 --> 00:43:40,246
are proud to have served you.

00:43:40,313 --> 00:43:41,647
Thank you.

00:43:41,714 --> 00:43:43,649
Oh, that's cool.

00:43:43,716 --> 00:43:44,684
We don't need props.

00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:46,519
At the end of the day,
we know what time it is.

00:43:46,586 --> 00:43:48,020
Give me some of that.

00:43:48,087 --> 00:43:49,488
SIDLE:
Do we have a

00:43:49,555 --> 00:43:50,923
breakfast budget, Grissom?

00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:53,059
I believe Catherine
was going to requisition one.

00:43:53,125 --> 00:43:54,927
Good, cause our
plates are up,
and nobody has

00:43:54,994 --> 00:43:56,062
any money.

00:43:57,430 --> 00:43:59,398
Right behind you.

00:43:59,465 --> 00:44:01,701
You, uh... you got me,
right, War?

00:44:01,767 --> 00:44:03,769
Yeah. Picture that.

00:44:08,174 --> 00:44:10,510
I never should have put you
in that position, Catherine.

00:44:10,576 --> 00:44:11,511
I'm sorry.

00:44:11,577 --> 00:44:13,479
What position?

00:44:14,947 --> 00:44:17,283
Never doubt
and never look back.

00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:20,386
That's how I live my life.

00:44:24,724 --> 00:44:26,759
I admire that.

00:44:28,995 --> 00:44:31,030
SIDLE:
Whole wheat and fruit?

00:44:31,097 --> 00:44:32,198
Who ordered that?

00:44:32,265 --> 00:44:34,267
Here.

00:44:34,333 --> 00:44:35,668
STOKES:
How's this
for service?

00:44:35,735 --> 00:44:36,669
Very good.

00:44:36,736 --> 00:44:38,171
Re... fried <i>beans. Mmm!</i>

00:44:38,237 --> 00:44:39,605
( <i>laughter</i> )
