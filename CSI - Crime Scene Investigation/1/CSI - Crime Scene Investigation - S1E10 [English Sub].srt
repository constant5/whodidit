00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,802
MAN: Isn't great to get back to nature.
You want to set camp here?


00:00:17,869 --> 00:00:19,804
We can camp on the moon,
just give me the shovel.


00:00:19,871 --> 00:00:21,606
Chill, chill.


00:00:21,673 --> 00:00:23,708
You got paper?


00:00:23,775 --> 00:00:25,343
I have what I need.


00:00:28,513 --> 00:00:30,114
( <i>insects buzzing</i> )

00:00:30,181 --> 00:00:31,749
Oh, my God!

00:00:31,816 --> 00:00:32,884
Angie?

00:00:32,951 --> 00:00:34,452
( <i>buzzing continues</i> )

00:00:34,519 --> 00:00:35,920
Angie!

00:00:35,987 --> 00:00:38,189
( <i>buzzing continues</i> )

00:00:41,226 --> 00:00:43,928
They're...
they're everywhere.

00:00:43,995 --> 00:00:45,530
What the...?

00:00:46,731 --> 00:00:48,266
That's a person.

00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:49,834
( <i>coughing</i> )

00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,371
DETECTIVE:
Hey.

00:01:01,212 --> 00:01:02,580
Hikers found her.

00:01:02,647 --> 00:01:04,649
Looks like a gunshot
to the head.

00:01:04,716 --> 00:01:06,918
Did you find a weapon?

00:01:06,985 --> 00:01:08,486
No.

00:01:13,925 --> 00:01:16,261
I hate bees.

00:01:16,327 --> 00:01:17,762
Just paper wasps

00:01:17,829 --> 00:01:20,632
and they're having
too much fun to
worry about us.

00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:26,938
I never get used to this part,
you know

00:01:27,005 --> 00:01:28,173
when the bugs get going.

00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:31,109
Just doing what
God intended...

00:01:31,176 --> 00:01:32,844
...recycling us back
to the earth.

00:01:34,279 --> 00:01:36,381
Hey, officer

00:01:36,447 --> 00:01:40,251
can I borrow some
of your hot coffee, please?

00:01:51,095 --> 00:01:52,263
Preservation.

00:01:56,968 --> 00:02:00,305
John...

00:02:00,371 --> 00:02:02,907
Paul...

00:02:04,275 --> 00:02:06,544
George...

00:02:07,812 --> 00:02:08,746
and Ringo.

00:02:08,813 --> 00:02:10,215
Beetles.

00:02:10,281 --> 00:02:12,884
No alkali fluids
in the dirt

00:02:12,951 --> 00:02:14,519
so she wasn't killed here.

00:02:14,586 --> 00:02:15,920
Whoever dumped her

00:02:15,987 --> 00:02:17,555
must have been
in a hurry.

00:02:17,622 --> 00:02:21,226
Didn't take the time
to bury her.

00:02:21,292 --> 00:02:22,927
What do you think?

00:02:22,994 --> 00:02:25,330
You got any of that beef jerky
you're always gnawing on?

00:02:25,396 --> 00:02:27,732
You can eat?

00:02:27,799 --> 00:02:29,868
I want to keep
these little fellas alive.

00:02:29,934 --> 00:02:32,070
They're our first witnesses
to the crime.

BROWN:
You guys want some coffee?

00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:10,212
Please, cream with some
of that fake stuff.

00:03:10,279 --> 00:03:12,815
There's nothing good
to eat around here.

00:03:13,849 --> 00:03:15,784
Hi, sorry I'm late.

00:03:15,851 --> 00:03:17,419
Hey, how's the body
with the bugs?

00:03:19,121 --> 00:03:20,890
How do you know
about that already?

00:03:20,956 --> 00:03:22,524
Hey, don't look at me.

00:03:22,591 --> 00:03:24,560
We, uh, played a hunch;
checked with Homicide.

00:03:24,627 --> 00:03:25,728
You were late.

00:03:25,794 --> 00:03:27,529
What do you have for us?

00:03:27,596 --> 00:03:29,164
A Paul Sorenson...

00:03:29,231 --> 00:03:32,201
...missing since last night.

00:03:32,268 --> 00:03:35,170
Last seen at home
of Richard Zeigler

00:03:35,237 --> 00:03:37,239
in-- ooh-- Summerlin.

00:03:37,306 --> 00:03:39,642
Summerlin... rich folks.

00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:41,744
Warrick, you can work
this with Catherine.

00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:43,913
Don't you have a
court date coming up?

00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:46,682
Yeah, the DA asked me
to testify on chain of custody.

00:03:46,749 --> 00:03:48,517
I could do that in my sleep.

00:03:48,584 --> 00:03:50,152
Listen, juries need
to have confidence

00:03:50,219 --> 00:03:51,887
in the evidentiary process.
Work with Catherine.

00:03:51,954 --> 00:03:53,222
Break off
when you have to appear.

00:03:53,289 --> 00:03:54,156
Yeah.

00:03:54,223 --> 00:03:55,758
Bye.

00:03:55,824 --> 00:03:56,525
Good luck.

00:03:56,592 --> 00:03:58,093
Bye.

00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,496
Need help with your homicide?

00:04:00,563 --> 00:04:03,198
No, Sara's going
to work with me.

00:04:03,265 --> 00:04:04,767
You get a missing person.

00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:06,068
Sheryl Applegate.

00:04:06,135 --> 00:04:08,671
Her husband notified
the police that
she took the car

00:04:08,737 --> 00:04:10,973
and headed to L.A.,
but she never showed up.

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,809
A few hours ago, PD found
her car at the bus station.

00:04:13,876 --> 00:04:15,377
They requested a CSI.

00:04:15,444 --> 00:04:17,947
She took the bus instead.
Case solved.

00:04:18,013 --> 00:04:19,048
( <i>laughing</i> )

00:04:19,114 --> 00:04:20,883
Hopefully you're right

00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,785
but until
she's located

00:04:22,851 --> 00:04:24,420
treat her car
like a crime scene.

00:04:47,243 --> 00:04:48,611
Is everything okay?

00:04:48,677 --> 00:04:50,246
You've been quiet
all night.

00:04:50,312 --> 00:04:52,314
Yeah... I got a call
the other day

00:04:52,381 --> 00:04:53,816
from Child Services

00:04:53,882 --> 00:04:57,620
asking about
you and Lindsey.

00:04:57,686 --> 00:05:00,256
I don't believe this.

00:05:00,322 --> 00:05:02,157
They told me
they'd notified you--

00:05:02,224 --> 00:05:04,760
some investigation--
that Eddie had made
a charge or something.

00:05:04,827 --> 00:05:06,462
Yes, he's pissed off

00:05:06,528 --> 00:05:09,431
because I won't let him
back into my life

00:05:09,498 --> 00:05:11,233
so he sics
Child Services on me.

00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,469
I never expected they were going
to talk to my friends.

00:05:13,535 --> 00:05:14,837
Well, what
did they ask?

00:05:14,904 --> 00:05:15,738
What did you say?

00:05:15,804 --> 00:05:17,940
Well, I...

00:05:18,007 --> 00:05:19,108
( <i>door opens</i> )

00:05:19,174 --> 00:05:20,109
Hello?

00:05:20,175 --> 00:05:21,343
Hi.

00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:23,746
Sir, we're with
the Las Vegas Crime Lab.

00:05:23,812 --> 00:05:25,748
We're here
about a Paul Sorenson.

00:05:25,814 --> 00:05:27,883
I'm Richard Zeigler.
The cops told me
you were coming.

00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:28,918
Here, please, come in.

00:05:28,984 --> 00:05:31,520
Thank you.
Thanks.

00:05:39,395 --> 00:05:41,130
Well, this, uh

00:05:41,196 --> 00:05:43,632
where the Sorenson
<i>was</i> displayed.

00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:47,436
Sorenson is a painting.

00:05:47,503 --> 00:05:48,671
Paul Sorenson was an artist.

00:05:49,939 --> 00:05:51,340
Early 1900s.

00:05:54,743 --> 00:05:56,178
How dumb are we?

00:05:56,245 --> 00:05:57,613
What's he know

00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,181
about the
forensic analysis

00:05:59,248 --> 00:06:00,449
of a friction ridge?

00:06:00,516 --> 00:06:01,650
Right on.

00:06:01,717 --> 00:06:03,452
I think
I may have surprised the guy

00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,853
while he was stealing it.

00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,822
<i>I came downstairs to read.</i>

00:06:09,525 --> 00:06:11,961
<i>By the time I got to the room,</i>
<i>he was gone</i>

00:06:12,027 --> 00:06:13,862
<i>but the door was open.</i>

00:06:16,532 --> 00:06:18,701
Why don't we dust for prints?

00:06:21,737 --> 00:06:22,838
What about

00:06:22,905 --> 00:06:24,106
the security alarm?

00:06:24,173 --> 00:06:25,541
Somebody disengaged it.

00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:29,712
BROWN:
You thinking

00:06:29,778 --> 00:06:30,646
what I'm thinking?

00:06:30,713 --> 00:06:33,682
Oh, yeah, inside job.

00:06:38,087 --> 00:06:40,990
So... was it a disaster
with Child Services?

00:06:41,056 --> 00:06:42,491
Disaster?

00:06:42,558 --> 00:06:43,826
What do you mean?

00:06:43,893 --> 00:06:45,728
Well, my job
does take me away
from my daughter.

00:06:45,794 --> 00:06:48,397
Nobody knows that
better than you.

00:06:48,464 --> 00:06:51,000
Yeah, but you think
I'd say that?

00:06:51,066 --> 00:06:52,835
Well, not
intentionally.

00:06:52,902 --> 00:06:56,739
They just, you know,
know how to ask questions.

00:06:56,805 --> 00:06:57,773
Are you finding anything?

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,409
We're working on it, sir.

00:07:02,678 --> 00:07:04,613
Your young woman
from the mountains.

00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,348
Do we know
who she is yet?

00:07:06,415 --> 00:07:09,852
I gave her prints
to Homicide for ID.

00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,187
There's the blanket
she was wrapped in.

00:07:12,254 --> 00:07:15,291
Whoever she is, last day
on earth was not pleasant.

00:07:15,357 --> 00:07:19,261
.38 caliber gun,
flush to the scalp.

00:07:19,328 --> 00:07:21,297
Shot clean through,
right to left.

00:07:21,363 --> 00:07:22,798
Bullet out
the other side.

00:07:22,865 --> 00:07:26,068
Stellate pattern
and beveled wound

00:07:26,135 --> 00:07:30,439
confirms the proximity
of barrel to scalp.

00:07:30,506 --> 00:07:34,043
No question this was
an intimate killing.

00:07:34,109 --> 00:07:36,645
GRISSOM:
Full of sound and fury

00:07:36,712 --> 00:07:40,616
signifying what, Doc?

00:07:40,683 --> 00:07:42,818
I took these.

00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:55,998
Fracture to the nasal bone,
orbital bone, mandibular...

00:07:56,065 --> 00:07:58,067
All facial fractures.

00:08:00,135 --> 00:08:02,271
Typical for battered women.

00:08:02,338 --> 00:08:05,608
These aren't fresh, are they?

00:08:05,674 --> 00:08:07,977
The old fracture lines indicate

00:08:08,043 --> 00:08:11,447
this woman was in a long-term
abusive relationship.

00:08:11,513 --> 00:08:13,782
Any idea
how long she's been dead?

00:08:13,849 --> 00:08:15,985
The elements
really got to her.

00:08:16,051 --> 00:08:17,319
Grissom and his insects

00:08:17,386 --> 00:08:20,122
are going to have
to figure that one out.

00:08:20,189 --> 00:08:21,924
Have we lost you,
Grissom?

00:08:21,991 --> 00:08:24,126
"The worms go in

00:08:24,193 --> 00:08:25,427
"the worms go out

00:08:25,494 --> 00:08:27,363
"the worms
play pinochle

00:08:27,429 --> 00:08:28,697
on your snout."

00:08:28,764 --> 00:08:31,367
Shakespeare again?

00:08:31,433 --> 00:08:33,302
An old nursery rhyme.

00:08:33,369 --> 00:08:36,472
ROBBINS:
A very special insect,
Dr. Seuss?

00:08:36,538 --> 00:08:41,510
A muscid fly--
typical only in urban areas.

00:08:41,577 --> 00:08:42,711
But you found her

00:08:42,778 --> 00:08:44,213
in the mountains.

00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,948
Hmm...

00:08:46,015 --> 00:08:47,917
How many people have access
to your home--

00:08:47,983 --> 00:08:49,318
keys and security code?

00:08:49,385 --> 00:08:53,656
Just my wife and my two sons
and, uh...

00:08:53,722 --> 00:08:55,157
my secretary.

00:08:55,224 --> 00:08:56,692
WILLOWS:
Can you get them all here?

00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:58,661
They might be able to help us
with evidence.

00:08:58,727 --> 00:08:59,895
Hey, Catherine

00:08:59,962 --> 00:09:01,997
check this out.

00:09:07,202 --> 00:09:11,574
Helix, antihelix, helix rim,
tragus, antitragus.

00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,075
I think the thief

00:09:13,142 --> 00:09:15,110
must have pressed his head
against the wall

00:09:15,177 --> 00:09:16,879
to check
if the painting was wired.

00:09:16,946 --> 00:09:18,547
Come on, an earprint?

00:09:18,614 --> 00:09:20,149
Hey, a jury
convicted

00:09:20,215 --> 00:09:22,084
a first-degree murderer

00:09:22,151 --> 00:09:23,419
based on a print
just like this

00:09:23,485 --> 00:09:24,920
two years ago in Washington.

00:09:24,987 --> 00:09:26,455
Yeah, I know, I know.

00:09:26,522 --> 00:09:28,791
I'd like to see that one
on appeal.

00:09:28,857 --> 00:09:30,759
Well, photograph and lift.

00:09:30,826 --> 00:09:33,562
We'll have someone
to compare it to soon enough.

00:09:43,038 --> 00:09:44,306
Okay, bear with me.

00:09:44,373 --> 00:09:46,642
I mean, you're
one of ten guys
in the country

00:09:46,709 --> 00:09:48,244
that understands
this stuff.

00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:51,714
I think there's at least 15,
but go on.

00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:52,881
What don't you get?

00:09:52,948 --> 00:09:54,516
Insects arrive

00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:57,086
at a corpse
in a specific order, right?

00:09:57,152 --> 00:10:00,389
Like summer follows the spring.

00:10:00,456 --> 00:10:02,458
And you can pinpoint
time of death

00:10:02,524 --> 00:10:04,226
based on the type and age

00:10:04,293 --> 00:10:06,495
of insects present
on the body?

00:10:06,562 --> 00:10:08,464
I watch the insects mature

00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:12,568
from eggs to larvae
to adults

00:10:12,635 --> 00:10:14,737
and then count backwards.

00:10:14,803 --> 00:10:15,905
Linear regression.

00:10:17,806 --> 00:10:20,075
How old are those
creepy crawlers?

00:10:20,142 --> 00:10:21,377
They're not done maturing yet.

00:10:21,443 --> 00:10:23,279
Oh.

00:10:23,345 --> 00:10:25,981
But when they are, I'll be able
to tell you how old they were

00:10:26,048 --> 00:10:27,549
when I found the body.

00:10:27,616 --> 00:10:29,785
Which will tell us
when the woman died.

00:10:29,852 --> 00:10:32,388
I ID'd her body through AFIS,
and located her husband.

00:10:32,454 --> 00:10:36,258
Let me guess, downtown,
the Fremont district?

00:10:36,325 --> 00:10:38,894
You know,
I'm not even going to ask.

00:10:38,961 --> 00:10:42,264
<i>Synthesiomyia Nudiseta</i>
is the Latin name.

00:10:42,331 --> 00:10:43,399
SIDEL:
It's a muscid fly.

00:10:43,465 --> 00:10:46,001
Only breeds in urban areas

00:10:46,068 --> 00:10:47,937
but Grissom found
one on our girl

00:10:48,003 --> 00:10:50,072
which means
she was probably killed downtown

00:10:50,139 --> 00:10:51,840
and then carried
into the mountains.

00:10:51,907 --> 00:10:53,609
Well, the neighbors heard
a gunshot

00:10:53,676 --> 00:10:55,311
at their apartment
five days ago.

00:10:55,377 --> 00:10:57,012
The "grieving"
husband...

00:10:57,079 --> 00:11:01,450
His name is Scott Shelton.

00:11:01,517 --> 00:11:04,353
What was her name?

00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,956
Kaye screamed at me a lot,
that's for sure

00:11:07,022 --> 00:11:08,657
but I didn't kill her.

00:11:08,724 --> 00:11:10,593
In fact, I was
out of town last week

00:11:10,659 --> 00:11:12,027
at a convention.

00:11:12,094 --> 00:11:14,863
Yeah, in New Orleans soaking up
the gumbo. You told us.

00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:17,533
When was the last time
you saw your wife?

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,867
Five days ago.

00:11:18,934 --> 00:11:20,603
When I came back from my trip

00:11:20,669 --> 00:11:22,471
she was gone.

00:11:22,538 --> 00:11:24,006
You didn't think
to notify the police?

00:11:24,073 --> 00:11:25,374
I keep
my personal business private.

00:11:25,441 --> 00:11:27,776
If Kaye had
left me again,
I wasn't going

00:11:27,843 --> 00:11:29,345
to broadcast it.

00:11:29,411 --> 00:11:32,114
BRASS:
So this neighbor lady

00:11:32,181 --> 00:11:35,117
who told me
that she heard a gunshot

00:11:35,184 --> 00:11:37,319
and a woman scream
inside your apartment...

00:11:37,386 --> 00:11:39,622
What, she just
imagined that?

00:11:39,688 --> 00:11:42,024
It was probably our TV.

00:11:42,091 --> 00:11:44,693
BRASS:
Uh-huh.

00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:49,164
Mr. Shelton...

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,469
did your wife drive race cars?

00:11:53,535 --> 00:11:55,671
You're kidding me?

00:11:55,738 --> 00:11:57,640
No.

00:11:57,706 --> 00:12:00,042
The two most common causes

00:12:00,109 --> 00:12:02,645
of facial trauma
in adult women:

00:12:02,711 --> 00:12:06,515
motor vehicle accidents
and domestic violence.

00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,856
These are your wife's X rays.

00:12:13,923 --> 00:12:17,092
Every face and neck fracture
your wife has sustained

00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:20,129
over the last six years
is highlighted.

00:12:22,831 --> 00:12:24,633
Kaye can get wild.

00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,403
If I came home late with friends

00:12:27,469 --> 00:12:28,938
I've wrestled her off me.

00:12:29,004 --> 00:12:30,272
I admit that.

00:12:30,339 --> 00:12:32,274
Three complaints against Scott
for spousal abuse

00:12:32,341 --> 00:12:33,609
in the last two years.

00:12:33,676 --> 00:12:35,110
Kaye was excitable.

00:12:35,177 --> 00:12:36,512
Like I said

00:12:36,579 --> 00:12:38,113
I've wrestled her
off me

00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,782
but I never, ever laid
a hand on her.

00:12:39,848 --> 00:12:41,750
How about a gun?

00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,422
You have your hands full
with her.

00:12:46,488 --> 00:12:48,023
So do you.

00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:49,792
We're going
to investigate
your apartment.

00:12:49,858 --> 00:12:51,760
Do we need a warrant
or are you going to play nice?

00:12:51,827 --> 00:12:53,462
Come on over.

00:12:53,529 --> 00:12:56,098
I've got nothing to hide.

00:12:56,165 --> 00:12:58,046
We'll be the judge of that.

00:13:20,095 --> 00:13:21,463
Detective Secula.

00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:22,765
Mr. Stokes.

00:13:22,831 --> 00:13:23,932
What's up?

00:13:23,999 --> 00:13:25,334
You got stuck
on this one, too?

00:13:25,401 --> 00:13:28,337
Yeah, well, missing person,
could be interesting.

00:13:28,404 --> 00:13:30,472
Husband reports wife missing.
Car's at a bus terminal?

00:13:30,539 --> 00:13:31,673
Come on.
Lady took a trip.

00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,209
Didn't want him
to know where to.

00:13:34,276 --> 00:13:35,310
Not much of a mystery.

00:13:35,377 --> 00:13:36,545
Auto unit
been by yet?

00:13:36,612 --> 00:13:37,980
No, they just
slim-jimmed.

00:13:38,046 --> 00:13:40,149
We checked for a body,
didn't find one.

00:13:40,215 --> 00:13:41,817
Big surprise.

00:13:41,884 --> 00:13:44,486
Yeah.

00:13:44,553 --> 00:13:46,922
No, I didn't touch a thing.

00:13:53,762 --> 00:13:55,764
Something wrong?

00:13:57,433 --> 00:13:59,368
We had dinner last week.

00:13:59,435 --> 00:14:01,370
I thought it went great.

00:14:01,437 --> 00:14:02,805
You never called.

00:14:02,871 --> 00:14:06,041
That doesn't mean
I wasn't going to.

00:14:18,654 --> 00:14:20,789
Is our missing person a redhead?

00:14:20,856 --> 00:14:22,758
Yeah.

00:14:22,825 --> 00:14:24,927
Call in a tow

00:14:24,993 --> 00:14:26,228
to the CSI garage.

00:14:26,295 --> 00:14:28,597
This case is now
officially interesting.

00:14:32,468 --> 00:14:34,069
CATHERINE:
It's just like a fingerprint...

00:14:34,136 --> 00:14:35,938
for your ears.
RICHARD:
Now, wait a minute.

00:14:36,004 --> 00:14:38,273
Are you thinking
one of <i>us</i> did this?

00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,275
Well, there's no
forced entry.

00:14:40,342 --> 00:14:42,077
Someone shut off
your alarm.

00:14:42,144 --> 00:14:43,112
That tells us

00:14:43,178 --> 00:14:44,546
that we eliminate
the family first

00:14:44,613 --> 00:14:46,014
before we widen
our investigation.

00:14:46,081 --> 00:14:49,184
I'll tell you what, I'm not
putting that crap on my ear.

00:14:49,251 --> 00:14:50,552
Well, we can
get a warrant.

00:14:50,619 --> 00:14:51,787
RICHARD:
Oh, no, nobody's

00:14:51,854 --> 00:14:54,256
getting a warrant
against this family.

00:14:54,323 --> 00:14:57,259
We'll humor them,
and get this over with.

00:14:57,326 --> 00:15:00,162
CATHERINE:
Thank you, sir.

00:15:13,242 --> 00:15:14,810
See?

00:15:47,609 --> 00:15:49,678
Mm-hmm, we got a match.

00:15:54,783 --> 00:15:57,152
CATHERINE:
Let me see...

00:15:57,219 --> 00:15:59,054
WARRICK:
Jason?

00:15:59,121 --> 00:16:00,756
What?

00:16:00,823 --> 00:16:02,524
Earprint talking.

00:16:15,971 --> 00:16:18,507
Why would you steal from me?

00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:22,611
Sir, are you going to
want to press charges?

00:16:22,678 --> 00:16:24,747
No, no, no, no.

00:16:24,813 --> 00:16:26,281
God, no, no, I just...

00:16:26,348 --> 00:16:29,918
We'll get help for Jason.
I don't want court records.

00:16:29,985 --> 00:16:31,286
CATHERINE:
Jason, do you

00:16:31,353 --> 00:16:32,454
still have the painting?

00:16:32,521 --> 00:16:34,490
What if I told you I sold it?

00:16:34,556 --> 00:16:36,458
Well, that would be
selling stolen property

00:16:36,525 --> 00:16:39,461
and you would be
arrested, no matter
what your dad says.

00:16:39,528 --> 00:16:40,829
Okay.

00:16:40,896 --> 00:16:43,832
Painting's in the trunk
of my car.

00:16:46,001 --> 00:16:47,636
Can I get you guys
something to drink?

00:16:47,703 --> 00:16:49,905
Soda, ale?

00:16:49,972 --> 00:16:52,508
SIDEL:
No, thanks.

00:17:05,287 --> 00:17:08,123
Not a lot of room for Kaye.

00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:09,091
She's shy.

00:17:19,401 --> 00:17:22,237
Does it get cold in
here in the winter?

00:17:22,304 --> 00:17:23,872
Sometimes.

00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:25,074
Why?

00:17:26,475 --> 00:17:29,711
That's why you'd need a
blanket on the couch, huh?

00:17:31,447 --> 00:17:33,715
A green one, I bet.

00:17:38,821 --> 00:17:41,623
Looks like your gun's
just been cleaned.

00:17:44,426 --> 00:17:46,662
Yeah, I, uh, cleaned it
before I left town.

00:17:46,729 --> 00:17:48,130
Took out the garbage, too.

00:17:48,197 --> 00:17:50,265
Does that make me
guilty of something?

00:17:52,401 --> 00:17:54,036
No bullets missing here.

00:18:03,712 --> 00:18:05,180
Bullets are missing here,
though.

00:18:07,015 --> 00:18:08,884
I fired them at the
shooting range last month.

00:18:08,951 --> 00:18:10,652
I go there with a
couple guys from work.

00:18:12,788 --> 00:18:14,156
We're going to need

00:18:14,223 --> 00:18:15,958
to borrow
your bullets.

00:18:40,616 --> 00:18:42,484
This back door
lead to your car?

00:18:42,551 --> 00:18:44,520
To <i>a</i> car.

00:18:44,586 --> 00:18:45,954
I drive a different
demo every day.

00:18:46,021 --> 00:18:47,322
Perk of the dealership.

00:18:50,993 --> 00:18:54,096
You smell that, Grissom?

00:18:55,631 --> 00:18:57,733
Did you do laundry
back here today?

00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:03,972
I got news for you, Scott.

00:19:05,507 --> 00:19:07,409
Bleach doesn't make
blood disappear.

00:19:07,476 --> 00:19:09,778
You just can't see it
with the naked eye.

00:19:48,917 --> 00:19:50,819
I have no idea
how that got there.

00:19:50,886 --> 00:19:53,655
It "got there" when you shot
your wife in the head before

00:19:53,722 --> 00:19:54,790
you wrapped her
in a blanket

00:19:54,857 --> 00:19:56,392
and you dumped her
in the mountains!

00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:57,960
Get your finger
out of my face, bitch!

00:19:58,026 --> 00:19:59,328
Touch me again,
draw back a stump!

00:19:59,395 --> 00:20:00,229
Look at her.
Sara!

00:20:00,295 --> 00:20:02,965
Can't you control her?
Get him out
of here, Jim.

00:20:03,031 --> 00:20:04,900
BRASS:
Come on.
You don't know a handful!

00:20:05,934 --> 00:20:08,003
What is the matter with you?

00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:09,538
I am a woman,
and I have a gun.

00:20:09,605 --> 00:20:10,906
And look how
he treated me.

00:20:10,973 --> 00:20:11,974
I can only imagine

00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,777
how he treated his wife.

00:20:25,287 --> 00:20:26,388
Thank you.

00:20:26,455 --> 00:20:27,790
Hey.
Hey.

00:20:27,856 --> 00:20:28,957
Nicky, how's it going?

00:20:29,024 --> 00:20:30,359
Good, good.

00:20:30,426 --> 00:20:32,795
Are you putting one of Lindsey's
drawings into evidence?

00:20:35,731 --> 00:20:37,800
If only her artwork brought
in this kind of dough

00:20:37,866 --> 00:20:40,069
I wouldn't need to worry
about her college tuition.

00:20:40,135 --> 00:20:42,237
Yeah, I heard your missing
person was a painting.

00:20:42,971 --> 00:20:44,239
At least we solved

00:20:44,306 --> 00:20:44,907
<i>our</i> case.

00:20:44,973 --> 00:20:47,376
Oh...!

00:20:48,243 --> 00:20:50,446
Keep walking.

00:20:50,512 --> 00:20:53,749
Give me an evidence tag
for this painting.

00:20:53,816 --> 00:20:55,551
Okay, now I know that
these are rich people

00:20:55,617 --> 00:21:00,255
and it's just a painting
and nobody died, but...

00:21:00,322 --> 00:21:01,857
this just doesn't
feel finished.

00:21:01,924 --> 00:21:04,793
I know every time you say that,
I'm looking at more overtime.

00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,862
I know.

00:21:06,929 --> 00:21:09,331
( <i>pager beeping</i> )

00:21:10,499 --> 00:21:11,900
You know what?

00:21:11,967 --> 00:21:12,935
I've got to be somewhere.

00:21:13,001 --> 00:21:14,369
Court.

00:21:14,436 --> 00:21:16,205
Yeah, right.

00:21:16,271 --> 00:21:19,007
Can you handle this from here?

00:21:19,074 --> 00:21:20,943
Yeah.

00:21:21,009 --> 00:21:23,078
Cool. I'll see you later.

00:21:23,145 --> 00:21:24,780
Hey, Warrick.

00:21:24,847 --> 00:21:26,482
Are you going to tell me?

00:21:26,548 --> 00:21:27,583
What?

00:21:27,649 --> 00:21:28,584
About Child Services?

00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:30,152
Oh, I told them as far

00:21:30,219 --> 00:21:32,287
as mothers are concerned,
you're the bomb.

00:21:32,354 --> 00:21:34,089
Really?

00:21:34,156 --> 00:21:36,825
Yeah, and I also told them
your ex is pretty screwed up.

00:21:38,527 --> 00:21:40,028
No worries.

00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,068
What do we need to
nail him at trial?

00:21:46,135 --> 00:21:48,203
The neighbor puts him in
the apartment five days ago.

00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:49,805
You tell me she's
been dead five days

00:21:49,872 --> 00:21:50,973
and a jury is
going to jump

00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:52,508
all over that
coincidence.

00:21:52,574 --> 00:21:54,777
The post-mortem insects will
tell me when she was killed.

00:21:54,843 --> 00:21:57,946
No, all I'm saying is five days
is what <i>I</i> need.

00:21:58,013 --> 00:21:59,281
Jim, please don't try

00:21:59,348 --> 00:22:00,983
and compromise my end
of the investigation.

00:22:01,049 --> 00:22:01,850
Good luck.

00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,102
The bullets from Scott's gun
are unusual.

00:23:29,104 --> 00:23:31,006
Since we didn't find
the spent bullet

00:23:31,073 --> 00:23:33,142
I sent one from the box
over to Trace.

00:23:34,943 --> 00:23:37,579
Everything else stacks up.

00:23:37,646 --> 00:23:39,114
He killed her.

00:23:42,484 --> 00:23:43,552
What'd you get?

00:23:43,619 --> 00:23:45,220
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:23:45,287 --> 00:23:47,523
She's been dead three days.

00:23:47,589 --> 00:23:48,724
Are you positive?

00:23:50,426 --> 00:23:51,493
Not five?

00:23:53,395 --> 00:23:54,963
Three.

00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,765
My client was in New Orleans
three days

00:23:56,832 --> 00:23:59,401
before his wife's body
was discovered on that mountain.

00:23:59,468 --> 00:24:01,570
He couldn't possibly
have killed her.

00:24:01,637 --> 00:24:02,704
Unless I misunderstand

00:24:02,771 --> 00:24:04,640
what you've explained
to us, Mr. Grissom

00:24:04,706 --> 00:24:07,376
your "linear regression."

00:24:07,443 --> 00:24:09,411
You understand.

00:24:09,478 --> 00:24:11,246
Okay, forget
time of death.

00:24:11,313 --> 00:24:12,881
How does your client explain

00:24:12,948 --> 00:24:15,250
Kaye's blood all over
his apartment wall?

00:24:15,317 --> 00:24:17,553
Quite simply.

00:24:17,619 --> 00:24:19,721
Scott has three prior complaints
for abuse.

00:24:19,788 --> 00:24:21,757
What's to say the blood
didn't get there

00:24:21,824 --> 00:24:23,459
during one of <i>those</i>
<i>altercations?</i>

00:24:23,525 --> 00:24:27,463
"Altercations"...
upgraded from "wrestling?"

00:24:27,529 --> 00:24:29,465
BRASS:
This is good.

00:24:29,531 --> 00:24:31,467
Admitting to prior abuse

00:24:31,533 --> 00:24:33,702
to cover up actual murder.

00:24:33,769 --> 00:24:36,205
My client and I are leaving.

00:24:37,439 --> 00:24:39,641
And Mr. Grissom, thank you.

00:25:01,232 --> 00:25:04,169
Hey, tough luck about
the, uh, wife abuser

00:25:04,235 --> 00:25:05,337
getting released.

00:25:05,403 --> 00:25:07,505
There's no secrets around you,
are there, Conrad?

00:25:07,572 --> 00:25:09,741
You think I wanted you
to whiff out on that?

00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:11,476
Your reputation
as an entomologist

00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:13,011
elevates this
entire crime lab

00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:15,013
which elevates
my stature

00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,481
by association.

00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:18,683
Well, then, you must feel
very small today...

00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:19,851
by association.

00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:23,688
You're dropping the ball
in other areas though.

00:25:23,755 --> 00:25:25,390
Administratively?

00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:27,125
Did I miss
one of your status meetings?

00:25:28,593 --> 00:25:32,264
Warrick Brown had one of my guys
sub for him in court.

00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,665
So? I'm sure something came up.

00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:34,699
Hey, he told my guy

00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:35,900
it was an emergency

00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:37,535
but I have it
on good authority

00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:40,205
that he was gambling.

00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:42,040
At the Monaco.

00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:43,875
What?

00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:45,243
That's right.

00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:47,078
On CSI time.

00:25:47,145 --> 00:25:49,080
I don't like him
using one of my guys

00:25:49,147 --> 00:25:50,548
as a cover.

00:25:50,615 --> 00:25:52,951
I figure if he brings anybody
down with him

00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:54,719
it should be from your shift.

00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:58,023
Don't you think?

00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:13,071
( <i>kettle whistling</i> )

00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:18,877
Sara?

00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:22,781
Sara?

00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:25,517
Are you okay?

00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:28,520
Fine. Yeah.

00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:31,489
Did you sleep here?

00:26:31,556 --> 00:26:34,059
I was working till 4:00 a.m.

00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:35,627
I combed

00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:37,362
every demo Scott's driven.

00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,097
Zilch.

00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:41,967
What's up?

00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:44,669
I need you to do some background
for me on Warrick

00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:46,271
without letting him know why.

00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:49,407
Oh. Warrick-- your favorite CSI.

00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:51,810
That's why I want you
to handle it

00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:54,379
so that Ecklie
can't accuse me
of favoritism

00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,247
if it turns out
that Warrick's clean.

00:26:56,314 --> 00:26:58,950
What do you want to know?

00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:03,388
This painting's a forgery?

00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,590
Where does it say that?

00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:09,160
I was reading up on Sorenson,
and I found a site that says

00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:11,763
that 15% of all museum art
is fake.

00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,665
It's not our job
to authenticate art.

00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:15,200
Case is closed.

00:27:15,267 --> 00:27:18,770
You're so right,
but if this is a forgery

00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:20,805
we've got a new crime.

00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:25,176
This ElectroThermal atomizer

00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:27,479
is set at the excitation
wavelength for titanium

00:27:27,545 --> 00:27:29,514
which was not used
in oil paint

00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:31,149
before the 1950s.

00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:32,851
So, an authentic Sorenson

00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:34,185
would be titanium-free.

00:27:34,252 --> 00:27:36,021
If it's present,
the canvas will fluoresce

00:27:36,087 --> 00:27:37,155
and we've got a forgery.

00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:38,223
Flip the lights.

00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:53,738
CATHERINE:
Mm-hmm.

00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:56,007
No doubt about it,
it's a fake.

00:27:56,074 --> 00:27:58,009
Okay, so if the owner

00:27:58,076 --> 00:27:59,044
purchased this painting

00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:00,412
from a reputable
auction house

00:28:00,478 --> 00:28:02,380
they would have run
a similar test to this?

00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:04,149
Absolutely.

00:28:04,215 --> 00:28:06,751
So, the kid stole the original
painting from his pop

00:28:06,818 --> 00:28:08,153
and gave us back a forgery.

00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:10,121
This kid's in
college, right?

00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:11,957
Let's check
his dorm room.

00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,934
There's no more hair.

00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:24,369
Not even a trace.

00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:25,971
No signs of foul play.

00:28:27,505 --> 00:28:28,607
And the carpet's clean.

00:28:28,673 --> 00:28:30,976
Yeah.

00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:32,210
Yeah, too clean...

00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:35,080
...which begs the question...

00:28:35,146 --> 00:28:36,848
What lies beneath?

00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:39,217
Hand me the phenothaline,
please.

00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,121
You're checking

00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:44,723
for blood?

00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:45,924
Well...

00:28:45,991 --> 00:28:47,292
I am checking...

00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:52,197
to see why someone scrubbed
this carpet so clean.

00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:55,066
If there is blood present...

00:28:58,703 --> 00:29:01,006
...we'll know why.

00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:06,177
It looks like our missing person
might be a homicide.

00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:08,446
Right.

00:29:10,882 --> 00:29:12,817
( <i>knocking</i> )

00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:14,085
Hey.

00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:16,521
Did you find out anything
about Warrick?

00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:20,158
Um... I'm-I'm here
about something else.

00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:27,198
You... you know how you say,
"We're the victim's last voice"?

00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,767
Mm-hmm.

00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:33,138
I thought it was <i>our</i> job
to speak for Kaye Shelton.

00:29:33,204 --> 00:29:37,375
You don't crunch evidence
to fit a theory.

00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:43,548
What if you hear
the victim's screams?

00:29:45,383 --> 00:29:47,686
In the car, at the store.

00:29:47,752 --> 00:29:49,287
You have empathy

00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:50,655
for her, Sara.

00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:53,825
You want someone to pay
for what was done to her.

00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:56,695
That's normal.

00:29:56,761 --> 00:29:58,196
You want to sleep with me?

00:30:05,604 --> 00:30:07,706
Did you just say
what I think you said?

00:30:07,772 --> 00:30:10,308
That way, when I wake up
in a cold sweat

00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:13,111
under the blanket,
hearing Kaye's screams...

00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:15,046
you can tell me it's nothing.

00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:17,682
It's just empathy.

00:31:07,265 --> 00:31:10,035
So, you planning a
little late-night luau?

00:31:10,101 --> 00:31:11,503
Roast pig?

00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:12,671
It's an experiment.

00:31:12,737 --> 00:31:15,573
Maybe Kaye <i>was</i> dead
five days.

00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,609
I thought your bugs
never made mistakes.

00:31:17,676 --> 00:31:18,810
They don't. People do.

00:31:20,078 --> 00:31:21,579
The victim was wrapped
in a blanket.

00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:22,948
Normally a blanket or clothing

00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:24,416
doesn't impact
insect maturation.

00:31:24,482 --> 00:31:27,619
The insects usually
fight their way in anyway.

00:31:27,686 --> 00:31:30,388
But I examined
the folds

00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:31,523
in Kaye's blanket.

00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:33,024
She was wrapped tight--

00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:35,126
maybe tighter
than I realized

00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:38,697
which would have decreased the
corpse's exposure to insects.

00:31:38,763 --> 00:31:40,932
So, it took longer
for the insects to get in there?

00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:42,300
And deposit their eggs.

00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:43,602
Maybe two whole days.

00:31:43,668 --> 00:31:46,071
I've wrapped Porky here
pretty tight.

00:31:46,137 --> 00:31:47,739
Well, let me
ask you this.

00:31:47,806 --> 00:31:49,040
You killed a pig
just for this?

00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:51,610
This poor ham was already
on its way

00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:53,078
to someone's
Christmas dinner table.

00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:55,213
I mean, wouldn't a rabbit
be easier?

00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,548
Got to be a pig.

00:31:56,615 --> 00:31:59,284
Interestingly,
they're the most like humans.

00:31:59,351 --> 00:32:01,753
Yeah, I've been saying that
since I was a rookie.

00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,622
You're on your own, pal.

00:33:07,886 --> 00:33:10,687
Thanks.

00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:36,211
How's the case going?

00:33:36,278 --> 00:33:37,813
Hey.

00:33:37,879 --> 00:33:40,715
Dead end.
How about you?

00:33:40,782 --> 00:33:42,050
Just got a hit

00:33:42,117 --> 00:33:44,186
on one of our missing lady's
credit cards.

00:33:44,252 --> 00:33:45,554
A motel.

00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:47,455
Her abductor
sold her card

00:33:47,522 --> 00:33:49,157
or is using it
himself.

00:33:49,224 --> 00:33:50,759
What motel?

00:33:50,826 --> 00:33:52,027
Four Aces.

00:33:52,093 --> 00:33:53,562
That's right
around the corner

00:33:53,628 --> 00:33:55,030
from where we found
her car.

00:33:55,096 --> 00:33:57,098
I've got some uniforms
meeting us there.

00:33:57,165 --> 00:33:59,267
Good job.

00:34:11,847 --> 00:34:14,149
Are you Sheryl Applegate?

00:34:14,216 --> 00:34:15,717
( <i>door opens</i> )

00:34:15,784 --> 00:34:17,786
Man:
Oh, whoa, man!

00:34:17,853 --> 00:34:19,921
Ow! Oh,
what's going on here?

00:34:19,988 --> 00:34:20,989
Michael, shut up!

00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:22,324
Las Vegas Police.

00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:24,059
Your husband reported you
missing.

00:34:24,126 --> 00:34:26,895
Can she put that gun away?

00:34:26,962 --> 00:34:28,230
You, uh, you haven't
been abducted

00:34:28,296 --> 00:34:29,431
have you, Mrs. Applegate?

00:34:29,498 --> 00:34:30,765
Not really.

00:34:30,832 --> 00:34:33,335
We found evidence of blood
in your car.

00:34:35,036 --> 00:34:39,975
I saw an injured dog last week
and drove it to the vet.

00:34:40,041 --> 00:34:41,309
( <i>clears throat</i> )

00:34:41,376 --> 00:34:43,411
Uh, Nick,
let's get out of here.

00:34:43,478 --> 00:34:45,680
( <i>clears throat</i> )

00:34:45,747 --> 00:34:46,414
Wait!

00:34:49,684 --> 00:34:51,486
What are you going to tell
my husband?

00:34:53,421 --> 00:34:55,457
That you're okay.

00:34:55,524 --> 00:34:57,092
You're going to have

00:34:57,159 --> 00:34:58,660
to fill in the blanks.

00:34:58,727 --> 00:35:00,328
( <i>muffled laughter</i> )

00:35:01,463 --> 00:35:03,632
So the pig's insects matured
at a rate

00:35:03,698 --> 00:35:06,935
consistent
with a five-day-old corpse?

00:35:07,002 --> 00:35:08,403
Once I took the blanket
into account.

00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:09,871
Your initial
computations
were wrong.

00:35:09,938 --> 00:35:14,276
You went back,
adjusted conditions

00:35:14,342 --> 00:35:16,344
and proved
actual time of death?

00:35:16,411 --> 00:35:17,779
Five days, not three.

00:35:17,846 --> 00:35:19,381
Which places the victim
with her husband

00:35:19,447 --> 00:35:20,982
who's already guilty as sin.

00:35:21,049 --> 00:35:22,951
Captain Brass

00:35:23,018 --> 00:35:24,820
do you understand
Grissom's

00:35:24,886 --> 00:35:26,321
insect evidence?

00:35:27,689 --> 00:35:28,623
To a degree.

00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:30,192
You know...

00:35:30,258 --> 00:35:31,793
in a general way.

00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:33,562
Do you think a jury

00:35:33,628 --> 00:35:36,364
will understand your
"adjustments"?

00:35:36,431 --> 00:35:39,401
Or do you think
they'll realize
your "conditions"

00:35:39,468 --> 00:35:41,470
can make the evidence
say anything you want it

00:35:41,536 --> 00:35:42,804
to say?

00:35:42,871 --> 00:35:45,607
I can make a case to any jury
against Scott Shelton

00:35:45,674 --> 00:35:47,142
for the murder of his wife.

00:35:47,209 --> 00:35:51,246
Your arresting officer
can barely understand it.

00:35:51,313 --> 00:35:53,215
I read the file.

00:35:53,281 --> 00:35:54,916
Other than bugs

00:35:54,983 --> 00:35:58,386
is there anything else?

00:36:02,891 --> 00:36:06,294
Get something a jury
can understand, or move on.

00:36:12,567 --> 00:36:13,502
Hello.

00:36:13,568 --> 00:36:14,836
Hello, Mr. Zeigler...

00:36:14,903 --> 00:36:16,171
Oh, oh, good,
you brought it.

00:36:16,238 --> 00:36:17,172
WILLOWS:
Yes.

00:36:17,239 --> 00:36:18,206
Come in.
Thank you.

00:36:19,674 --> 00:36:23,712
That's a nice campus
you got there, Jason.

00:36:23,778 --> 00:36:25,046
What?

00:36:25,113 --> 00:36:27,215
We went by your dorm earlier
with the police here.

00:36:27,282 --> 00:36:28,617
We'd like to ask a favor of you

00:36:28,683 --> 00:36:30,485
Mr. Zeigler.

00:36:30,552 --> 00:36:33,321
A private viewing
of the painting.

00:36:39,561 --> 00:36:43,865
My God, my-my...
my Sorenson's a forgery?

00:36:49,237 --> 00:36:52,741
Wait, I have
ten million dollars'

00:36:52,808 --> 00:36:53,642
worth of forgeries?

00:36:53,708 --> 00:36:55,677
BROWN:
No, sir.

00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:01,283
The police recovered
your originals

00:37:01,349 --> 00:37:02,785
in Jason's
dorm room today.

00:37:02,785 --> 00:37:04,120
What?

00:37:06,522 --> 00:37:08,024
I don't even know you.

00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:10,026
BROWN:
What, did you have
an art major

00:37:10,092 --> 00:37:11,427
do your fakes for you, Jason?

00:37:11,494 --> 00:37:14,630
WILLOW:
Robbery checked
with your school.

00:37:14,697 --> 00:37:19,168
They actually teach classes
in how to copy the masters.

00:37:19,235 --> 00:37:20,736
My friends helped me out.

00:37:20,803 --> 00:37:23,840
They didn't know what I was
doing with the copies.

00:37:23,906 --> 00:37:26,442
And what exactly
were you doing?

00:37:26,509 --> 00:37:28,144
Your son stole
all your originals

00:37:28,211 --> 00:37:29,779
replacing them with forgeries.

00:37:29,846 --> 00:37:33,082
But the other night,
his little scam was interrupted.

00:37:38,221 --> 00:37:40,623
If the hook hadn't dislodged
from your Sorenson

00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:42,825
you would have spent the rest
of your life

00:37:42,892 --> 00:37:45,194
admiring a fake.

00:37:45,261 --> 00:37:47,463
And you never even knew
the difference, did you, Dad?

00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:49,866
You're right.

00:37:49,932 --> 00:37:50,967
You don't know me.

00:37:51,033 --> 00:37:52,869
Where are your pictures of me?

00:37:52,935 --> 00:37:54,904
You're too busy staring

00:37:54,971 --> 00:37:58,841
at your masterpieces,
and they're not even real!

00:37:58,908 --> 00:38:00,543
I'm right here, Dad.

00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:02,945
You don't even see me.

00:38:05,414 --> 00:38:07,750
The police are going to want
to know

00:38:07,817 --> 00:38:10,353
if you're pressing charges
this time.

00:38:15,925 --> 00:38:18,161
I am.

00:38:21,197 --> 00:38:24,667
You want my attention,
Jason?

00:38:26,102 --> 00:38:28,070
You got it.

00:38:36,212 --> 00:38:39,182
I heard you were going
into an autopsy.

00:38:41,117 --> 00:38:43,419
How can you just move on
to another case?

00:38:43,486 --> 00:38:45,721
They're laughing at us.
You know that, right?

00:38:45,788 --> 00:38:48,191
They think we're
a couple of science nerds.

00:38:48,257 --> 00:38:49,725
They threw out
our findings.

00:38:49,792 --> 00:38:50,993
That body should be up

00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,728
in a few minutes,
Mr. Grissom.

00:38:52,795 --> 00:38:54,797
Thank you, David.

00:38:54,864 --> 00:38:57,200
You know, there was
a murder recently

00:38:57,266 --> 00:39:00,069
in a village
on the other side
of the world.

00:39:00,136 --> 00:39:01,704
Every man in the
village denied

00:39:01,771 --> 00:39:02,939
having any part of it.

00:39:03,005 --> 00:39:05,374
The victim's throat
had been slashed
with a shovel.

00:39:05,441 --> 00:39:06,676
So this one guy--

00:39:06,742 --> 00:39:08,878
I guess you could call
him a science nerd--

00:39:08,945 --> 00:39:10,680
asked all the men
in the village

00:39:10,746 --> 00:39:13,249
to bring their shovels
to the center of town

00:39:13,316 --> 00:39:15,885
and hold them
spade-side up.

00:39:15,952 --> 00:39:17,253
And he waited.

00:39:19,041 --> 00:39:21,867
Eventually, flies
started showing up

00:39:21,867 --> 00:39:23,969
on one specific shovel

00:39:24,036 --> 00:39:27,006
looking for microscopic bits
of blood and flesh.

00:39:27,072 --> 00:39:28,774
"First witness to a crime."

00:39:28,841 --> 00:39:31,110
The investigator got
his murderer, and...

00:39:31,176 --> 00:39:33,345
...and forensic science
was born.

00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:34,747
Sung T'su, 1235 A.D.

00:39:34,813 --> 00:39:37,216
You call 800 years ago
recent?

00:39:37,283 --> 00:39:39,618
To an astronomer, it is.

00:39:39,685 --> 00:39:43,622
But then people forgot
about forensic science,
didn't they?

00:39:43,689 --> 00:39:45,024
And they had to be
reminded again

00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:46,392
by Francesco Redi
in the 1600s.

00:39:46,458 --> 00:39:48,460
And again by Bergeret d'Arbois
in the 1800s.

00:39:48,527 --> 00:39:50,629
Every civilization learns
what it needs to know

00:39:50,696 --> 00:39:51,930
and the next one
forgets it.

00:39:51,997 --> 00:39:54,767
The sheriff...

00:39:54,833 --> 00:39:58,504
Well... it's not personal.

00:39:59,838 --> 00:40:01,106
We're part of a cycle.

00:40:01,173 --> 00:40:02,908
Yeah, they laughed
at fingerprints

00:40:02,975 --> 00:40:04,843
70 years ago,
and now it's law.

00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:07,346
Except somebody had to push
for prints.

00:40:07,413 --> 00:40:09,581
And you're standing there saying

00:40:09,648 --> 00:40:11,750
"All things in their own time."

00:40:11,817 --> 00:40:13,819
You're confused, right?

00:40:13,886 --> 00:40:17,256
Yes.

00:40:17,323 --> 00:40:19,692
That's the best place
for a scientist to be.

00:40:19,758 --> 00:40:21,660
( <i>doors opening</i> )

00:40:21,727 --> 00:40:25,097
My body's here.

00:40:32,004 --> 00:40:34,607
Kaye Shelton...

00:40:34,673 --> 00:40:36,775
Shall we?

00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,916
SIDEL:
You gave her
a bath, huh?

00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:45,584
Routine cleaning.

00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:47,920
We had to do it sometime.

00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:48,988
Doc, what's this

00:40:49,054 --> 00:40:50,155
blue mark here?

00:40:50,222 --> 00:40:51,790
Why didn't we see this
at the autopsy?

00:40:51,857 --> 00:40:53,759
It was under a gallon of blood.

00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:56,562
But the blue's embedded;
it won't wash away.

00:40:56,629 --> 00:41:00,132
Didn't you say the suspect's
ammunition was in Trace?

00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:02,468
Yeah.

00:41:10,042 --> 00:41:14,280
"Lead, copper, zinc...

00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:16,582
Teflon."

00:41:16,649 --> 00:41:18,617
Teflon?

00:41:45,611 --> 00:41:46,545
And? So?

00:41:46,612 --> 00:41:49,248
Strand of hair from our lady
in the mountains.

00:41:49,315 --> 00:41:52,251
The blue dust
from around her entrance wound--

00:41:52,318 --> 00:41:55,554
that's from
the bullet's impact.

00:41:55,621 --> 00:41:56,922
It's made of Teflon.

00:41:56,989 --> 00:41:59,091
Now look at the next specimen.

00:42:03,495 --> 00:42:05,164
The bullet is

00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:07,232
from Scott's personal
ammo supply

00:42:07,299 --> 00:42:08,467
which I test-fired.

00:42:08,534 --> 00:42:11,370
See, the Teflon disintegrated
into blue powder

00:42:11,437 --> 00:42:12,938
at the moment of impact.

00:42:13,005 --> 00:42:15,240
You're gonna leave me,
is that what you think?!

00:42:15,307 --> 00:42:16,575
No, Scott, no!

00:42:16,642 --> 00:42:18,410
And the guys are gonna see
a woman walk out on me?

00:42:18,477 --> 00:42:19,812
No! Scott, no!
You just try...

00:42:19,878 --> 00:42:21,513
( <i>gunshot</i> )

00:42:29,955 --> 00:42:31,357
You did very good.

00:42:31,423 --> 00:42:33,392
But this is just more
circumstantial evidence.

00:42:33,459 --> 00:42:35,294
We're a long way
from a conviction.

00:42:35,361 --> 00:42:36,962
But we can bury him
under evidence.

00:42:37,029 --> 00:42:38,597
You're the one
who's always saying

00:42:38,664 --> 00:42:39,598
it's better to have

00:42:39,665 --> 00:42:41,200
one piece
of forensic evidence

00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:42,434
than ten eyewitnesses.

00:42:42,501 --> 00:42:44,336
What, do you tape everything
I say?

00:42:44,403 --> 00:42:46,605
You still have
to educate the jury.

00:42:46,672 --> 00:42:47,339
On bullets.

00:42:47,406 --> 00:42:48,407
It's got to be

00:42:48,474 --> 00:42:49,575
easier than bugs.

00:42:50,676 --> 00:42:52,845
Less Latin.

00:42:55,481 --> 00:42:56,815
( <i>handcuffs clicking</i> )

00:42:56,882 --> 00:43:00,119
BRASS:
You know, I've been waiting
three days to do this.

00:43:00,185 --> 00:43:02,154
No, make that five days.

00:43:03,389 --> 00:43:05,124
Let's go.

00:43:38,958 --> 00:43:40,793
( <i>door opens</i> )

00:43:42,294 --> 00:43:43,329
Hi.

00:43:43,395 --> 00:43:45,297
Hi.

00:43:45,364 --> 00:43:47,499
I checked out Warrick.

00:43:47,566 --> 00:43:51,837
His story about missing
court was, uh... lame.

00:43:51,904 --> 00:43:53,372
I got this

00:43:53,439 --> 00:43:56,442
surveillance tape
from the Monaco.

00:43:56,508 --> 00:43:59,011
He was in the casino.

00:44:00,813 --> 00:44:01,880
I'm sorry.

00:44:08,882 --> 00:44:09,561
Thanks.
