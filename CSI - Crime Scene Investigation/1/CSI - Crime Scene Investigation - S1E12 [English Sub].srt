00:00:16,917 --> 00:00:20,320
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!


00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:22,389
( <i>man grunts</i> )


00:01:12,834 --> 00:01:15,703
This came for you,
Mr. Grissom.


00:01:17,505 --> 00:01:19,674
What's this?


00:01:19,741 --> 00:01:21,309
An anonymous package
from county lockup?


00:01:21,376 --> 00:01:23,144
Yeah, well, hey,
just a second.


00:01:23,211 --> 00:01:26,614
Wait a minute. Give an innocent
bystander a chance to clear out.


00:01:26,681 --> 00:01:28,016
What are you worried about?


00:01:28,082 --> 00:01:29,651
One minute
I'm eating tomato salad.


00:01:29,717 --> 00:01:30,818
The next--


00:01:30,885 --> 00:01:32,187
I'm gazpacho.


00:01:37,525 --> 00:01:38,860
With any luck


00:01:38,927 --> 00:01:40,929
it'll be the next episode
of <i>G-String Divas.</i>


00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:52,307
My name is Frank Damon...

00:01:52,373 --> 00:01:56,644
and I'm awaiting trial
for the murder of...

00:01:56,711 --> 00:01:58,479
my wife and son.

00:01:58,546 --> 00:02:00,448
That's an arson case
a few months ago.

00:02:00,515 --> 00:02:02,750
The D.A. is asking
for the death penalty.

00:02:04,085 --> 00:02:08,590
I didn't kill my family...

00:02:08,656 --> 00:02:11,693
but my lawyer says
the evidence is against me.

00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:14,262
I was a good father.

00:02:14,329 --> 00:02:16,598
I loved him.

00:02:16,664 --> 00:02:20,101
I would have given my life
for Toby and Jeannie.

00:02:20,168 --> 00:02:21,569
They were my world.

00:02:21,636 --> 00:02:25,273
Mr. Grissom,
you are my last hope.

00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,308
Please...

00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,578
help me.

00:02:30,645 --> 00:02:33,948
An innocent man.

00:02:34,015 --> 00:02:35,750
Jail's full of them.

00:02:35,817 --> 00:02:39,721
It only takes one.

Yeah.


00:03:24,847 --> 00:03:26,182
Good.


00:03:26,887 --> 00:03:29,857
Oh. Great. Sorry.


00:03:29,924 --> 00:03:31,492
Uh, I was supposed
to pass out


00:03:31,559 --> 00:03:33,261
some supervisor
evaluation forms.


00:03:33,327 --> 00:03:34,595
Where are they?


00:03:34,662 --> 00:03:36,397
Here they are.


00:03:36,464 --> 00:03:38,266
Mm. Get to rate
the boss. I dig this.


00:03:38,332 --> 00:03:39,400
Give him
a perfect ten


00:03:39,467 --> 00:03:40,768
or your ass
is out of here.


00:03:40,835 --> 00:03:42,270
No, it's not.


00:03:42,336 --> 00:03:43,738
All right.
Assignment:


00:03:43,804 --> 00:03:45,773
parking lot of the sportsbook
at The Monaco.


00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,342
Caucasian male found dead
in the front seat of his car.


00:03:48,409 --> 00:03:49,744
Two days before the Super Bowl.


00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,045
I'll take a piece of that.


00:03:51,112 --> 00:03:53,014
No. Uh, Nick and Catherine.


00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,216
What else you got?
GRISSOM:
You and Warrick


00:03:55,283 --> 00:03:56,584
are working with me.


00:03:56,651 --> 00:03:57,551
WILLOWS:
Prisoner plea.


00:03:57,618 --> 00:03:58,819
Brass told me about the video.


00:03:58,886 --> 00:04:00,688
If we take the case,
we have very little time.


00:04:00,755 --> 00:04:01,956
The trial starts
in three days.


00:04:02,023 --> 00:04:03,457
How did he find you?


00:04:03,524 --> 00:04:04,759
1-800-GRISSOM...?


00:04:04,825 --> 00:04:05,860
WILLOWS:
Wait a minute.


00:04:05,927 --> 00:04:07,862
Ecklie was the CSI


00:04:07,929 --> 00:04:09,730
on that arson.


00:04:09,797 --> 00:04:12,199
I see a bad moon rising.


00:04:12,266 --> 00:04:14,235
Can a CSI take over
another CSI's case?


00:04:14,302 --> 00:04:15,603
Only if they're
of equal rank


00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:16,871
and looking for trouble.


00:04:16,938 --> 00:04:18,205
No trouble.


00:04:18,272 --> 00:04:20,141
We're both colleagues
searching for the truth.


00:04:20,207 --> 00:04:21,943
Okay, that's it.
Look onward.


00:04:22,009 --> 00:04:24,145
You have to start
by looking at this.


00:04:24,211 --> 00:04:26,747
Hey, what happened to that,
uh, meeting the other day?


00:04:26,814 --> 00:04:28,382
Meeting?


00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:30,051
Yeah, the department
heads were voting


00:04:30,117 --> 00:04:31,652
on an extra vacation day
or something?


00:04:31,719 --> 00:04:32,687
Yeah.


00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:40,595
Hmm. "Organization"...
minus one.


00:04:44,131 --> 00:04:46,000
Yo, cousin.


00:04:47,034 --> 00:04:48,669
I'm going to save you
some gas here.


00:04:48,736 --> 00:04:50,571
I did some checking
on your pal, Damon.


00:04:50,638 --> 00:04:52,573
I don't remember asking you to.


00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,542
Eyewitness saw him running
from his burning house.


00:04:54,609 --> 00:04:55,676
Inside was his wife and kid.


00:04:55,743 --> 00:04:56,978
Now, wife's
a big spender.


00:04:57,044 --> 00:04:58,512
Maxed out
on the credit cards.


00:04:58,579 --> 00:04:59,714
They just bought the place


00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,549
and already he's late
on the payments.


00:05:01,616 --> 00:05:03,951
Couple's always arguing
about money. No surprise.


00:05:04,018 --> 00:05:05,686
Well, how does
killing his family


00:05:05,753 --> 00:05:07,088
solve his money problems?


00:05:07,154 --> 00:05:08,422
Maybe
he didn't mean to.


00:05:08,489 --> 00:05:10,324
Maybe he needed
the insurance dough


00:05:10,391 --> 00:05:11,859
and things got out of hand.


00:05:11,926 --> 00:05:13,027
Too many maybes.


00:05:13,094 --> 00:05:15,029
I think we should go
with the evidence.


00:05:15,096 --> 00:05:17,198
Well, I got something
for you on that, too.


00:05:17,265 --> 00:05:19,467
Gasoline found
in the master bedroom closet.


00:05:19,533 --> 00:05:21,636
Yeah. Hydrocarbon.
I read Ecklie's brief.


00:05:21,702 --> 00:05:22,770
Did you
skip the page


00:05:22,837 --> 00:05:24,939
that had Damon's
credit card receipts?


00:05:25,006 --> 00:05:26,807
'Cause he bought
a gallon of gas


00:05:26,874 --> 00:05:28,776
a week before the fire.


00:05:28,843 --> 00:05:32,647
Do I seem like the kind of guy
who skips stuff?


00:05:32,713 --> 00:05:33,848
Read my lips.


00:05:33,915 --> 00:05:36,050
There is no compelling evidence
to suggest


00:05:36,117 --> 00:05:37,618
Damon was wrongfully charged.


00:05:37,685 --> 00:05:40,688
Well, then, it'll be
a short interview, won't it?


00:05:40,755 --> 00:05:43,057
( <i>car starts</i> )


00:05:48,429 --> 00:05:51,299
STOKES:
Whew! Two days
before the Super Bowl


00:05:51,365 --> 00:05:53,968
and they're already
killing each other.


00:05:54,035 --> 00:05:55,536
Hey, O'Riley, anyone put


00:05:55,603 --> 00:05:56,971
their meat hooks
on this vehicle?


00:05:57,038 --> 00:05:58,406
How long have
we worked together?


00:05:58,472 --> 00:06:00,041
Still got to ask.


00:06:00,107 --> 00:06:01,375
Sergeant.


00:06:01,442 --> 00:06:02,977
What's up?


00:06:03,044 --> 00:06:04,645
Oh...


00:06:04,712 --> 00:06:07,848
Gunshot wound to the head,
point-blank range.


00:06:07,915 --> 00:06:11,519
Just a baby.


00:06:25,733 --> 00:06:27,602
Tap city.


00:06:27,668 --> 00:06:29,270
Empty.


00:06:29,337 --> 00:06:32,106
WILLOWS:
<i>Killer was probably</i>
<i>in the back seat</i>


00:06:32,173 --> 00:06:33,307
<i>waiting for him.</i>


00:06:35,943 --> 00:06:38,813
<i>Kid never stood a chance.</i>


00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,118
Check this out.


00:06:44,185 --> 00:06:45,286
Hearing aid?


00:06:45,353 --> 00:06:47,421
Maybe he was deaf.


00:06:47,488 --> 00:06:49,991
Possibly.


00:06:57,598 --> 00:07:01,035
Got some condensation
on the window.


00:07:01,102 --> 00:07:03,704
You should get
a shot of this.

00:07:06,607 --> 00:07:07,843
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:07:07,843 --> 00:07:10,279
You hungry, Nick?

00:07:10,345 --> 00:07:11,480
Got a burger.

00:07:11,546 --> 00:07:14,683
Extra lettuce.

00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,986
A rule of thumb:
$2,500 an inch.

00:07:18,053 --> 00:07:20,222
There's got to be...

00:07:20,289 --> 00:07:21,056
$15,000 there?

00:07:21,123 --> 00:07:22,658
"Rams

00:07:22,724 --> 00:07:25,193
negative nine."

00:07:30,065 --> 00:07:32,401
Oh, "Rams <i>minus</i> nine."

00:07:32,467 --> 00:07:34,336
It's a Super Bowl ticket.

00:07:34,403 --> 00:07:36,071
Straight bet-- $30,000.

00:07:36,138 --> 00:07:37,839
What does a kid doing
walking around

00:07:37,906 --> 00:07:38,840
with a wad like that

00:07:38,907 --> 00:07:40,642
betting 30 grand
on a football game?

00:07:40,709 --> 00:07:43,011
Who wrote
the ticket?

00:07:43,078 --> 00:07:45,514
Teller 12.

00:07:45,581 --> 00:07:47,416
Yeah, I wrote the ticket.
So what?

00:07:47,482 --> 00:07:49,518
So, it was found
with the kid killed

00:07:49,585 --> 00:07:50,686
in your parking lot.

00:07:50,752 --> 00:07:52,154
Yeah. 30 dimes.
It was 517's.

00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,488
517?

00:07:53,555 --> 00:07:55,023
What's that?
That's his number.

00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:55,857
He was a runner.

00:07:55,924 --> 00:07:57,259
A runner?

00:07:57,326 --> 00:07:58,860
Yeah, a go-fer--
runs from book to book

00:07:58,927 --> 00:08:00,529
places bets
with other people's money.

00:08:00,596 --> 00:08:02,764
Kid wasn't a day over 16.
Isn't that illegal?

00:08:02,831 --> 00:08:04,566
Lady, he's not buying
a pack of cigarettes.

00:08:04,633 --> 00:08:05,567
He's betting $30,000.

00:08:05,634 --> 00:08:06,969
Vig for the house
is three grand.

00:08:07,035 --> 00:08:07,970
We look the other way.

00:08:08,036 --> 00:08:09,438
Well, I'd be
willing to bet

00:08:09,504 --> 00:08:11,473
there's a mother out there
that wishes you hadn't.

00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,808
Hey, what do I care?

00:08:12,874 --> 00:08:14,843
I'm out of this job
by the end of the week.

00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,278
Tired of looking at scumbags.

00:08:16,345 --> 00:08:17,846
Well, does 517 have a name?

00:08:17,913 --> 00:08:19,648
I only know them
by their numbers.

00:08:19,715 --> 00:08:21,116
Well, you've been very helpful.

00:08:21,183 --> 00:08:22,317
Thank you.

00:08:30,058 --> 00:08:31,660
Thanks.

00:08:31,727 --> 00:08:33,996
MAN:
Yo, Grissom!

00:08:34,062 --> 00:08:37,065
Yo, man, this guy's
the reason I'm in here.

00:08:37,132 --> 00:08:38,233
Shoe print.

00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,469
Yo, man, next time
I'll go barefoot!

00:08:40,535 --> 00:08:42,137
Even better.

00:08:42,204 --> 00:08:44,206
Footprints.

00:09:02,557 --> 00:09:03,825
So, you're the Grissom

00:09:03,892 --> 00:09:05,894
they wrote about
in the newspaper?

00:09:05,961 --> 00:09:09,298
I thought
you'd be older.

00:09:09,364 --> 00:09:11,733
Why did you contact me,
Mr. Damon?

00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,903
Arson specialist
gave me your name.

00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:17,506
Well, six of them, actually.

00:09:17,572 --> 00:09:20,242
They all turned my case down.

00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:23,812
Will you help me?

00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:26,014
Fires are
very complicated.

00:09:26,081 --> 00:09:29,785
It wasn't too complicated
for the guy who put me in here.

00:09:34,456 --> 00:09:36,692
You think if you

00:09:36,758 --> 00:09:40,228
stare at me long enough,
you can tell if I'm innocent?

00:09:40,295 --> 00:09:42,497
I don't mean to stare...

00:09:42,564 --> 00:09:45,467
but yes,
I can learn some things.

00:09:45,534 --> 00:09:46,635
For instance

00:09:46,702 --> 00:09:48,770
the back of your
hands are smooth.

00:09:48,837 --> 00:09:49,938
You read a lot.

00:09:50,005 --> 00:09:52,975
You have indentation marks
on your nose

00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:54,676
from reading glasses.

00:09:54,743 --> 00:09:58,313
Your speech tells me
that you're well-educated.

00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,450
Your occupation's not
listed in the file

00:10:01,516 --> 00:10:03,352
but I think
that you had

00:10:03,418 --> 00:10:05,187
a white-collar job.

00:10:05,254 --> 00:10:08,824
Paper-pusher
for the phone company.

00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:12,494
I don't know yet
whether you're left-

00:10:12,561 --> 00:10:14,763
or right-handed,
though.

00:10:16,632 --> 00:10:18,567
Now, you want
to tell me

00:10:18,634 --> 00:10:20,769
what happened?

00:10:22,437 --> 00:10:24,006
It was about midnight.

00:10:24,072 --> 00:10:25,574
Okay, baby.

00:10:25,641 --> 00:10:28,243
<i>My wife, Jeannie--</i>
<i>she was hungry.</i>

00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:30,145
<i>She had a food craving.</i>

00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:32,014
She sent me out to the store

00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,649
to get her
some ice cream.

00:10:33,715 --> 00:10:36,351
<i>My son, Toby, he was</i>
<i>in the bed with us.</i>

00:10:36,418 --> 00:10:37,452
<i>He couldn't sleep.</i>

00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,687
<i>I was going</i>

00:10:38,754 --> 00:10:40,956
<i>to take him camping</i>
<i>the next day.</i>

00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:46,361
Toby was eight.

00:10:46,428 --> 00:10:50,032
Why don't you tell me
about the fire.

00:10:53,368 --> 00:10:57,372
<i>I got back from the store</i>
<i>in under 20 minutes.</i>

00:10:57,439 --> 00:11:01,043
<i>I saw smoke coming out</i>
<i>the back of the house.</i>

00:11:01,109 --> 00:11:02,210
<i>I could hear the alarm.</i>

00:11:02,277 --> 00:11:03,211
Jeannie!

00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:04,379
<i>The house was filled</i>

00:11:04,446 --> 00:11:05,948
<i>with smoke.</i>

00:11:06,014 --> 00:11:07,115
Jeannie!

00:11:07,182 --> 00:11:08,817
<i>I checked the door for heat.</i>

00:11:08,884 --> 00:11:10,953
<i>I knew not to open it.</i>

00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:12,721
Why?
Flashover.

00:11:12,788 --> 00:11:15,290
Flashover?

00:11:15,357 --> 00:11:16,625
That's right.

00:11:16,692 --> 00:11:19,027
When the fire reaches
about 932 degrees Fahrenheit

00:11:19,094 --> 00:11:20,195
you add oxygen

00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:23,031
and the smoke
will burst into flame.

00:11:23,098 --> 00:11:26,702
I know how fire behaves,
Mr. Grissom

00:11:26,768 --> 00:11:30,072
because I'm a volunteer fireman.

00:11:30,138 --> 00:11:34,076
I was hoping to make
the department this spring.

00:11:34,142 --> 00:11:36,345
So I couldn't open the door.

00:11:36,411 --> 00:11:39,348
I ran outside to my car
to call a rig.

00:11:39,414 --> 00:11:41,950
Well, if you're
a volunteer fireman

00:11:42,017 --> 00:11:46,054
then you must be familiar
with the use of accelerants.

00:11:46,121 --> 00:11:47,556
Yes.

00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:49,524
According
to the report

00:11:49,591 --> 00:11:52,461
there were traces of gasoline
found on the floor

00:11:52,527 --> 00:11:53,929
of your bedroom closet.

00:11:53,996 --> 00:11:59,201
That's right, and I don't know
how it got there.

00:11:59,268 --> 00:12:01,436
I didn't keep anything
like that in the house.

00:12:01,503 --> 00:12:04,006
Our homicide department
has a credit card receipt

00:12:04,072 --> 00:12:07,442
for gasoline-- your receipt

00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:09,778
and there's no
other suspects.

00:12:09,845 --> 00:12:15,550
I didn't burn down my house,
Mr. Grissom.

00:12:15,617 --> 00:12:20,756
I bought the gasoline
for the lawnmower

00:12:20,822 --> 00:12:23,158
and kept it in the garage.

00:12:23,225 --> 00:12:26,762
Now, if there was gasoline
in our closet

00:12:26,828 --> 00:12:29,197
someone else put it there.

00:12:29,264 --> 00:12:30,966
Find <i>them.</i>

00:12:31,033 --> 00:12:32,935
I don't chase criminals,
Mr. Damon.

00:12:33,001 --> 00:12:34,403
I just evaluate evidence.

00:12:34,469 --> 00:12:36,605
I need someone

00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:38,473
to believe me--

00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:41,977
to figure this out.

00:12:42,044 --> 00:12:45,414
How'd you burn your hand,
Mr. Damon?

00:12:48,283 --> 00:12:50,352
I don't remember.

00:12:50,419 --> 00:12:56,992
People with third-degree burns
don't forget how they got them.

00:13:00,729 --> 00:13:03,599
You're not going to help me?

00:13:03,665 --> 00:13:08,270
I'll take your case.

00:13:08,846 --> 00:13:12,507
I don't know whether
I'll help you or not.

00:14:02,155 --> 00:14:04,758
Nothing harder to investigate
than arson.

00:14:04,825 --> 00:14:07,561
If the fire hasn't ruined
your crime scene...

00:14:07,627 --> 00:14:08,628
Sara:
The firemen have?

00:14:08,695 --> 00:14:09,629
Mmm.

00:14:09,696 --> 00:14:10,897
Funny place
for a mattress.

00:14:10,964 --> 00:14:12,065
Overhaul.

00:14:12,132 --> 00:14:14,734
Post-blaze, firemen removed
charred items

00:14:14,801 --> 00:14:16,603
to neutralize the hot spots.

00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,138
It prevents flare-ups.

00:14:32,986 --> 00:14:34,988
( <i>camera shutter clicking</i> )

00:14:39,392 --> 00:14:41,428
Looks like the kid
was going camping.

00:14:41,495 --> 00:14:43,296
( <i>unlocking latches</i> )

00:14:50,937 --> 00:14:52,472
Waterproof matches.

00:14:52,539 --> 00:14:54,508
Bag those.

00:14:54,574 --> 00:14:55,942
What do you think?

00:14:56,009 --> 00:14:57,310
The kid might have started it?

00:14:59,946 --> 00:15:01,815
We don't rule anything out.

00:15:01,882 --> 00:15:03,884
GRISSOM:
Yeah.

00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:19,566
Master bedroom.

00:15:19,633 --> 00:15:21,768
The fire was contained

00:15:21,835 --> 00:15:23,537
inside this room...

00:15:25,739 --> 00:15:28,275
but the outside doorframe

00:15:28,341 --> 00:15:31,511
is severely charred.

00:15:31,578 --> 00:15:33,980
Well, fires take the path
of least resistance.

00:15:34,047 --> 00:15:36,650
I mean, they feed off
of oxygen and combustibles.

00:15:36,716 --> 00:15:39,085
GRISSOM:
We're going to take
a piece of this back
to the lab.

00:15:39,152 --> 00:15:40,220
It's a weird place for such

00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,454
a thorough burn

00:15:41,521 --> 00:15:43,290
especially since the door
isn't scorched.

00:15:43,356 --> 00:15:45,025
Huh.

00:15:47,394 --> 00:15:48,829
Look at this.

00:15:48,895 --> 00:15:50,864
Rubber?

00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:57,771
Firemen wear rubber gloves.

00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:06,980
According to Ecklie's report,
which was filed in record time

00:16:07,047 --> 00:16:08,181
the point of origin

00:16:08,248 --> 00:16:11,017
for the fire
was the closet.

00:16:11,084 --> 00:16:13,286
Of course, there's
nothing left here.

00:16:15,021 --> 00:16:17,157
More than you think.

00:16:17,224 --> 00:16:21,261
"V" pattern
on the outside wall.

00:16:21,328 --> 00:16:24,064
Fires like to go
up and out.

00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:26,666
That's why you can always
count on seeing a pattern.

00:16:26,733 --> 00:16:27,968
This one's narrow.

00:16:28,034 --> 00:16:31,104
This was very intense,
rapidly moving fire.

00:16:31,171 --> 00:16:33,507
Well, that confirms
Ecklie's findings

00:16:33,573 --> 00:16:35,509
about the use of an accelerant.

00:16:35,575 --> 00:16:38,912
The apex of the "V"
usually indicates

00:16:38,979 --> 00:16:40,780
the point of origin.

00:16:40,847 --> 00:16:42,716
You want to call it?

00:16:42,782 --> 00:16:45,685
Damon doused the closet floor
with gasoline, lit it

00:16:45,752 --> 00:16:47,654
and got the hell
out of Dodge.

00:16:50,957 --> 00:16:52,792
Shards of glass.

00:16:52,859 --> 00:16:53,960
Bag a sample.

00:16:54,027 --> 00:16:55,629
I'll put it
through the lab.

00:16:55,695 --> 00:16:56,630
Can't.

00:16:56,696 --> 00:16:59,132
It's melted into the concrete.

00:17:03,003 --> 00:17:04,804
So, that's why
the concrete's discolored?

00:17:04,871 --> 00:17:05,805
From the heat?

00:17:05,872 --> 00:17:06,907
It's called "spalling."

00:17:06,973 --> 00:17:08,775
It confirms the presence
of an accelerant.

00:17:08,842 --> 00:17:12,045
Why would there be glass
in the middle of the hot spot?

00:17:12,112 --> 00:17:14,047
Good question.
WARRICK:
Who cares?

00:17:14,114 --> 00:17:15,615
The guy torched
his wife and kid.

00:17:15,682 --> 00:17:18,385
Really?

00:17:18,451 --> 00:17:20,153
Where's the trailing?

00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,255
An arsonist would spread
the gasoline around

00:17:22,322 --> 00:17:24,524
to maximize the burn area.

00:17:26,393 --> 00:17:29,129
He still did the job.

00:17:29,196 --> 00:17:31,198
Listen, you guys.

00:17:31,264 --> 00:17:32,465
You're like <i>Dodger</i> fans.

00:17:32,532 --> 00:17:34,668
The ball game's only
in the seventh inning

00:17:34,734 --> 00:17:36,469
you're already out
of your seats.

00:17:57,257 --> 00:17:59,092
Mrs. Hillman?

00:18:02,596 --> 00:18:05,065
Is this your son?

00:18:06,867 --> 00:18:08,869
( <i>inhales</i> )

00:18:14,508 --> 00:18:16,510
( <i>sobbing</i> )

00:18:22,048 --> 00:18:24,050
( <i>whimpering</i> )

00:18:36,963 --> 00:18:38,965
( <i>sighing</i> )

00:18:40,834 --> 00:18:43,236
Mrs. Hillman?

00:18:43,303 --> 00:18:45,305
Was your son
hearing-impaired?

00:18:45,372 --> 00:18:47,741
Joey was wearing
a hearing aid.

00:18:49,075 --> 00:18:50,844
No.

00:18:50,911 --> 00:18:53,380
No, Joey's hearing was fine.

00:18:54,981 --> 00:18:56,583
Why would he have that?

00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:58,485
( <i>softly</i> ):
I don't know.

00:19:01,221 --> 00:19:03,523
Wait a minute.

00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,926
( <i>sighing</i> )

00:19:08,261 --> 00:19:10,330
Danny... swore to me

00:19:10,397 --> 00:19:13,934
he'd keep Joey
out of that racket.

00:19:15,969 --> 00:19:17,270
Danny?

00:19:17,337 --> 00:19:19,206
My older son.

00:19:19,272 --> 00:19:20,874
He's a runner, too.

00:19:20,941 --> 00:19:22,042
They wear

00:19:22,108 --> 00:19:23,210
remote earpieces.

00:19:23,276 --> 00:19:26,546
That's how they talk
to the guy they worked for.

00:19:26,613 --> 00:19:29,850
We've had full-scale wars
about him doing that

00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:31,985
carrying around
that kind of money

00:19:32,052 --> 00:19:33,053
but does he stop?

00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:34,554
No.

00:19:34,621 --> 00:19:37,691
He gets Joey involved.

00:19:37,757 --> 00:19:41,361
Well, the police will want
to talk to your son, Danny.

00:19:41,428 --> 00:19:43,530
I haven't seen him in a week.

00:19:43,597 --> 00:19:46,266
And he hasn't
returned my calls.

00:19:48,034 --> 00:19:50,904
Do you think something's
happened to him, too?

00:19:54,174 --> 00:19:56,176
( <i>Grissom sighs</i> )

00:19:57,878 --> 00:19:59,412
Grissom.

00:19:59,479 --> 00:20:01,481
I'll see you guys
in the evidence lab.

00:20:01,548 --> 00:20:03,917
Night shift so slow you've
got to pick over my cases?

00:20:03,984 --> 00:20:06,653
I'm just making sure that we've
answered all the questions.

00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,854
Was it arson? Yes.

00:20:07,921 --> 00:20:09,523
No doubt about it.
What accelerant was used?

00:20:09,589 --> 00:20:12,225
Let's see, hydrocarbon residue,
and a credit card receipt.

00:20:12,292 --> 00:20:13,927
Got to be <i>gasoline.</i>
Yeah.

00:20:13,994 --> 00:20:15,795
Why was there no trailing?

00:20:15,862 --> 00:20:17,831
And why no evidence
of an incendiary device

00:20:17,898 --> 00:20:18,832
anywhere in the bedroom?

00:20:18,899 --> 00:20:20,100
He's a volunteer
fireman, Gil.

00:20:20,167 --> 00:20:22,636
He knows how to start a fire
and hide the evidence.

00:20:22,702 --> 00:20:25,305
Don't you think if this guy
was <i>remotely</i> innocent

00:20:25,372 --> 00:20:27,908
his attorney would be involved
in your little investigation?

00:20:27,974 --> 00:20:29,209
What are you
so afraid of, Conrad?

00:20:29,276 --> 00:20:30,977
We're just a couple
of science geeks.

00:20:31,044 --> 00:20:32,078
Why can't we work together?

00:20:32,145 --> 00:20:33,413
No, we are public servants.

00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,582
We investigate cases
as efficiently as we can

00:20:35,649 --> 00:20:36,716
and then we move on.

00:20:36,783 --> 00:20:38,552
We're not a clearinghouse
for defendants

00:20:38,618 --> 00:20:39,653
on the eve of trial

00:20:39,719 --> 00:20:41,188
who don't like
what we've turned up.

00:20:41,254 --> 00:20:42,322
Yes, we are

00:20:42,389 --> 00:20:44,124
if it's our mistake
that put them there.

00:20:44,191 --> 00:20:46,793
Fine, spin your wheels.

00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,428
Hey, Eck?

00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:52,399
What is the new policy
on vacation days?

00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:57,671
WARRICK:
Runners, huh?

00:20:57,737 --> 00:20:59,806
I know a little something
about that world.

00:20:59,873 --> 00:21:01,208
Yeah, we thought you might.

00:21:01,274 --> 00:21:02,209
So?

00:21:02,275 --> 00:21:03,510
It breaks down like this.

00:21:03,577 --> 00:21:05,812
There's about a half a dozen
runners in town.

00:21:05,879 --> 00:21:06,980
They're mostly kids

00:21:07,047 --> 00:21:08,715
and they make
about <i>two</i> "G's" a week.

00:21:08,782 --> 00:21:10,450
And they all work
for the same guy.

00:21:10,517 --> 00:21:12,586
Well, that's more than
a little something.

00:21:12,652 --> 00:21:13,687
I used to be a runner

00:21:13,753 --> 00:21:14,788
in college.

00:21:14,855 --> 00:21:16,656
It paid the bills.

00:21:16,723 --> 00:21:18,391
I had Route Five.

00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:21,495
Worked Boulder, Sunset,
Vacation, and The Bay--
all of that.

00:21:21,561 --> 00:21:23,396
So, who was
your boss then?

00:21:23,463 --> 00:21:24,831
The Voice.

00:21:24,898 --> 00:21:26,299
He didn't have a name?

00:21:26,366 --> 00:21:29,769
Runners go from bet to bet,
they jot down their orders

00:21:29,836 --> 00:21:31,471
and they call them
into "The Voice."

00:21:31,538 --> 00:21:33,507
Guy runs the entire operation
underground.

00:21:33,573 --> 00:21:35,876
I mean, he takes orders
from <i>back</i> East

00:21:35,942 --> 00:21:37,544
and lays them
off in Vegas.

00:21:37,611 --> 00:21:39,513
Pockets his vig,
his commission.

00:21:39,579 --> 00:21:42,249
He's like the trader
on the stock exchange.

00:21:42,315 --> 00:21:44,851
( <i>pager beeping</i> )

00:21:44,918 --> 00:21:46,953
I knew it. That's Grissom.

00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,388
I've got to bail.

00:21:49,956 --> 00:21:53,260
So... how do we find
this, uh... "Voice"?

00:21:53,326 --> 00:21:54,661
You don't.

00:21:54,728 --> 00:21:56,229
He's not who
you're looking for anyway.

00:21:56,296 --> 00:21:57,831
If you want to know
who capped this kid

00:21:57,898 --> 00:21:59,699
then you should talk
to another runner.

00:21:59,766 --> 00:22:02,435
I mean, they'll kill each other
for a good route.

00:22:08,575 --> 00:22:11,611
Uh... you might want to
take three giant steps

00:22:11,678 --> 00:22:13,046
<i>backward.</i>

00:22:13,113 --> 00:22:15,849
WARRICK:
What's going on?
Danger, Will Robinson.

00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:19,252
Three drops of gasoline,
limited oxygen supply

00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:23,390
heat to ignition temperature
of 932 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:22:23,456 --> 00:22:25,892
Same conditions in Damon's
bedroom the night of the fire.

00:22:29,396 --> 00:22:31,231
Smoke to fire.

00:22:31,298 --> 00:22:32,599
Flashover.

00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:34,734
So, that confirms the first part
of Damon's story.

00:22:34,801 --> 00:22:37,437
Tell me you're here
to confirm part two.

00:22:37,504 --> 00:22:40,607
As a matter of fact,
here is your doorframe.

00:22:43,743 --> 00:22:45,645
I had Collins analyze
the burn depth.

00:22:45,712 --> 00:22:47,280
You see these
rolling blisters?

00:22:47,347 --> 00:22:48,648
It's called
alligatoring.

00:22:48,715 --> 00:22:49,816
See the way
the wood's cracked?

00:22:49,883 --> 00:22:51,318
It looks like the skin
of an alligator.

00:22:51,384 --> 00:22:53,620
Based on the depth
of the allir... allo...

00:22:53,687 --> 00:22:55,021
Alligatoring.

00:22:55,088 --> 00:22:58,024
This wood burned very hot
and very fast.

00:22:58,091 --> 00:23:00,060
Use of accelerant?
Negative.

00:23:00,126 --> 00:23:03,263
But that piece was a doorframe
<i>outside</i> of the bedroom--

00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:04,831
which was a contained site.

00:23:04,898 --> 00:23:07,300
So, the only way this
could've happened was...

00:23:07,367 --> 00:23:08,368
O2.

00:23:18,111 --> 00:23:19,679
Damon opened the door.

00:23:21,414 --> 00:23:22,682
He lied.

00:23:25,352 --> 00:23:26,853
So, what happens now?

00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,755
We chase the lie...

00:23:28,822 --> 00:23:30,244
till it leads to the truth.

00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:47,296
All right.
You take care.

00:23:47,296 --> 00:23:48,931
And don't-don't worry.

00:23:48,998 --> 00:23:50,866
Everything's
going to be fine.

00:23:59,345 --> 00:24:00,713
That's my sister.

00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:04,050
She's the only one
who stood by me
in all of this.

00:24:06,485 --> 00:24:08,687
Anything else
you want to tell me?

00:24:08,754 --> 00:24:11,957
What, about my sister?

00:24:12,024 --> 00:24:15,761
About the fire.

00:24:15,828 --> 00:24:17,430
I...

00:24:17,496 --> 00:24:19,698
I told you everything.

00:24:19,765 --> 00:24:22,535
Your bedroom doorframe
disagrees.

00:24:22,601 --> 00:24:25,738
If no one opened the door...

00:24:25,805 --> 00:24:28,140
the outside frame
would not have burned.

00:24:28,207 --> 00:24:29,975
As a firefighter

00:24:30,042 --> 00:24:32,044
you know that.

00:24:34,513 --> 00:24:36,716
May I see your hand,
please?

00:24:36,782 --> 00:24:38,784
Palm up.

00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:48,394
This is the same type

00:24:48,461 --> 00:24:50,996
of doorknob that you have
on your bedroom door.

00:25:02,341 --> 00:25:04,844
Mr. Damon...

00:25:06,746 --> 00:25:09,448
Please...

00:25:09,515 --> 00:25:12,585
I don't want anyone to know.

00:25:12,651 --> 00:25:14,053
Why?

00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,088
This places you outside
of the fire.

00:25:16,155 --> 00:25:20,526
You're facing
the death penalty.

00:25:20,593 --> 00:25:22,228
Why are you lying?

00:25:24,063 --> 00:25:27,867
I'm a firefighter.

00:25:27,933 --> 00:25:33,954
And when my wife and my son
<i>needed</i> me...

00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:40,179
I forgot <i>everything.</i>

00:25:40,246 --> 00:25:41,380
<i>I didn't check for heat.</i>

00:25:41,447 --> 00:25:42,381
Jeannie!

00:25:42,448 --> 00:25:43,682
<i>I didn't look for smoke.</i>

00:25:43,749 --> 00:25:47,119
<i>All I could think about</i>
<i>was getting them out.</i>

00:25:47,186 --> 00:25:49,221
<i>So I opened the door...</i>

00:25:49,288 --> 00:25:51,557
<i>and I let the monster out.</i>

00:25:51,624 --> 00:25:53,893
<i>I could just about make them</i>
<i>out through the flame.</i>

00:25:53,959 --> 00:25:55,161
Jeannie! Jeannie!

00:25:55,227 --> 00:25:57,129
<i>But I... I couldn't</i>
<i>get to them!</i>

00:25:57,196 --> 00:25:58,197
( <i>howling</i> ):
Oh!

00:26:01,367 --> 00:26:03,069
What else?

00:26:03,135 --> 00:26:05,237
I had to close the door.

00:26:05,304 --> 00:26:07,573
The whole house
would've gone up

00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,875
and the firemen would
have never reached them.

00:26:11,911 --> 00:26:15,047
I <i>killed</i> my family.

00:26:16,082 --> 00:26:18,217
Carbon monoxide killed them

00:26:18,284 --> 00:26:21,220
long before the fire
got to them.

00:26:21,287 --> 00:26:22,621
You know about
CO2 poisoning.

00:26:22,688 --> 00:26:24,490
It doesn't matter what I know.

00:26:24,557 --> 00:26:27,793
My family died because
I wasn't there to protect them.

00:26:29,595 --> 00:26:32,698
You tried to save your family

00:26:32,765 --> 00:26:35,534
but that doesn't mean
that you didn't start the fire.

00:26:35,601 --> 00:26:41,273
Are you lying
about that, too?

00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:44,643
You tell me.

00:26:46,979 --> 00:26:50,082
I will.

00:26:50,149 --> 00:26:53,953
TONY:
Hey, you didn't hear this
from me, all right? But, um...

00:26:54,019 --> 00:26:56,856
you see the guy
over there--
blue sweatshirt

00:26:56,922 --> 00:26:59,225
with the orange hood?

00:26:59,291 --> 00:27:00,760
702.

00:27:00,826 --> 00:27:02,261
He's a runner.

00:27:02,328 --> 00:27:05,097
He used to hang
with 517-- the kid
who was killed.

00:27:05,164 --> 00:27:07,433
He's not talking
to himself, is he?

00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,468
Talking to his boss on a wire.

00:27:09,535 --> 00:27:12,271
It's illegal to use two-way
communication in the sportsbook.

00:27:12,338 --> 00:27:14,407
As long as you don't get caught.

00:27:14,473 --> 00:27:16,609
I've got to get
back to work.

00:27:19,812 --> 00:27:21,514
Lakers are minus 11.

00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:22,948
The total is 189.

00:27:23,015 --> 00:27:24,817
Yeah. Bulls pick.

00:27:24,884 --> 00:27:27,186
Kings are down
to nine from eleven.

00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:34,226
Done.

00:27:35,394 --> 00:27:36,295
Lakers.

00:27:36,362 --> 00:27:37,763
$50,000.

00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,432
Give me as much
at 11 as you can.

00:27:39,498 --> 00:27:41,333
You like the
Lakers today?

00:27:44,904 --> 00:27:46,338
So do I.

00:27:46,405 --> 00:27:49,508
Yeah, Joey Hillman, 517.

00:27:49,575 --> 00:27:51,210
Yeah, he was
a good kid.

00:27:51,277 --> 00:27:53,245
It's too bad about him
getting shot.

00:27:53,312 --> 00:27:54,413
Yeah, I guess

00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,615
all the runners heard
about it by now, huh?

00:27:56,682 --> 00:27:58,417
I guess.

00:27:58,484 --> 00:27:59,685
So, who got Joey's route?

00:27:59,752 --> 00:28:00,753
I don't know.

00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,655
The only thing
I know is my own route.

00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,290
What was Joey's route, exactly?

00:28:04,356 --> 00:28:06,092
You guys are asking
a lot questions here

00:28:06,158 --> 00:28:07,526
for not being cops, huh?

00:28:07,593 --> 00:28:09,195
Are you interested
in helping us

00:28:09,261 --> 00:28:11,464
better understand
Joey's crime scene, or...

00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:12,598
...not?

00:28:12,665 --> 00:28:15,000
I only know
what I see on the news.

00:28:17,136 --> 00:28:19,772
Later.

00:28:21,474 --> 00:28:23,342
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:28:43,329 --> 00:28:44,997
You got me.

00:28:45,064 --> 00:28:46,198
Sorry.

00:28:46,265 --> 00:28:47,533
What are <i>you</i> doing here?

00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,668
Sifting through this debris.

00:28:49,735 --> 00:28:51,537
You mind?

00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:53,706
No.

00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:55,875
Give me a hand
with this mattress.

00:29:12,591 --> 00:29:14,593
Space heater.

00:29:15,661 --> 00:29:18,264
Janko Electric, Model...

00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:19,265
...220.

00:29:19,331 --> 00:29:20,433
WARRICK:
Or it was.

00:29:20,499 --> 00:29:22,601
I figure it must have
burned up in the bedroom

00:29:22,668 --> 00:29:24,136
and the firemen
threw it out here

00:29:24,203 --> 00:29:25,671
with the rest of this overhaul.

00:29:25,738 --> 00:29:28,441
GRISSOM:
This is heavy-duty,
high voltage.

00:29:28,507 --> 00:29:31,711
This thing could heat
our whole lab.

00:29:31,777 --> 00:29:33,579
Or overload a house.

00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:37,717
Breaker box.

00:29:39,752 --> 00:29:41,020
WARRICK:
Circuit overload.

00:29:41,087 --> 00:29:42,521
The master bedroom.

00:29:42,588 --> 00:29:45,291
You know what
to do next?

00:29:45,357 --> 00:29:48,060
Yeah.

00:29:48,127 --> 00:29:50,362
( <i>drilling</i> )

00:29:56,268 --> 00:29:58,471
The condensation
inside Joey's
back seat window

00:29:58,537 --> 00:29:59,472
is nasal mucus.

00:29:59,538 --> 00:30:00,606
From a sneeze.
Most likely.

00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:01,607
You're thinking...

00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:03,042
the shooter was
in the back seat?

00:30:03,109 --> 00:30:04,276
Mm-hmm, with the sniffles.

00:30:04,343 --> 00:30:05,344
Mm-hmm.

00:30:05,411 --> 00:30:07,246
So what is the DNA like
in mucus these days?

00:30:07,313 --> 00:30:09,181
It's pretty good.

00:30:09,248 --> 00:30:10,449
I'll start a DNA profile.

00:30:10,516 --> 00:30:11,550
Thanks.

00:30:11,617 --> 00:30:13,185
Catherine?

00:30:13,252 --> 00:30:14,453
Oh, hi, David.

00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,554
What's up?

00:30:15,621 --> 00:30:17,623
There's someone waiting
for you in reception.

00:30:21,394 --> 00:30:22,695
Detective?

00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:26,265
She came in with her son.

00:30:26,332 --> 00:30:27,833
Thought you'd like
a conversation

00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,635
before we sat
down with him.

00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:32,004
Yeah, thanks.

00:30:32,071 --> 00:30:33,172
Did you call Nick?

00:30:33,239 --> 00:30:34,173
Yeah.

00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,243
Uh... come on.

00:30:37,309 --> 00:30:39,178
This is my son, Danny.

00:30:39,245 --> 00:30:41,347
He heard about Joey
and came home.

00:30:43,349 --> 00:30:45,584
So, I took some
of my runner money

00:30:45,651 --> 00:30:47,620
and I hit the
blackjack tables.

00:30:47,686 --> 00:30:50,589
I lost...

00:30:50,656 --> 00:30:52,291
so I doubled up.

00:30:52,358 --> 00:30:55,528
I ended up losing 30 grand
in eight minutes.

00:30:55,594 --> 00:30:56,996
Well, I can see
why you ran.

00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:58,764
I was scared.

00:30:58,831 --> 00:31:01,367
You know, it wasn't my money.

00:31:01,434 --> 00:31:02,535
NICK:
Did you think

00:31:02,601 --> 00:31:04,370
to get back to your boss?

00:31:04,437 --> 00:31:05,538
Try to make amends?

00:31:07,239 --> 00:31:09,208
You guys don't even know
who your boss is, do you?

00:31:09,275 --> 00:31:11,711
NICK:
Did you tell Joey

00:31:11,777 --> 00:31:14,113
to get out of town, that someone
might try to harm him?

00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,414
On behalf of your boss?

00:31:15,481 --> 00:31:17,283
I should have.

00:31:17,349 --> 00:31:18,784
But, no...

00:31:18,851 --> 00:31:21,520
DANNY:
I only worried
about <i>my</i> butt.

00:31:21,587 --> 00:31:24,590
They killed Joey
to send a message to me.

00:31:26,959 --> 00:31:28,728
Mom, I'm sorry. I didn't know.

00:31:31,397 --> 00:31:33,566
CATHERINE:
Danny...

00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:37,136
...do you have any idea
who shot your brother?

00:31:37,203 --> 00:31:39,939
One of the runners.

00:31:40,005 --> 00:31:41,173
Probably a guy...

00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,174
No!

00:31:42,241 --> 00:31:44,243
No. No names.

00:31:45,478 --> 00:31:48,147
DANNY:
One of them
killed Joey.

00:31:48,214 --> 00:31:50,216
You know, they'll do
anything for money.

00:31:50,282 --> 00:31:52,084
It's like a-a disease.

00:31:52,151 --> 00:31:54,420
And if you talk,
they'll come after you.

00:31:54,487 --> 00:31:55,588
No.

00:31:55,654 --> 00:31:58,324
No, I'm not losing
another child.

00:31:58,391 --> 00:32:00,025
Joey died because of me.

00:32:00,092 --> 00:32:02,428
Either they find his shooter,
or I do.

00:32:02,495 --> 00:32:04,096
NICK:
Whoa, whoa!

00:32:04,163 --> 00:32:05,164
Hold on, now.

00:32:05,231 --> 00:32:07,166
Nobody's going after anybody.

00:32:07,233 --> 00:32:10,069
Okay, he doesn't have to give us
a name, Ms. Hillman, all right?

00:32:11,904 --> 00:32:14,173
Danny, you wear an earpiece,
right?

00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,410
Just give us the frequency
your runners operate on.

00:32:30,423 --> 00:32:32,358
What the hell are you doing?

00:32:32,425 --> 00:32:34,593
Something you probably
should have done.

00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:37,496
You're checking
for faulty wiring?

00:32:37,563 --> 00:32:38,998
Waste of time, Gil.

00:32:39,065 --> 00:32:40,866
The fire started on
the floor in the closet

00:32:40,933 --> 00:32:42,201
not in the wires
in the wall.

00:32:42,268 --> 00:32:43,936
Yeah, that was your report.

00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:46,238
This is an electrical socket
from the closet

00:32:46,305 --> 00:32:48,140
where a space heater
was plugged in.

00:32:48,207 --> 00:32:49,575
A heater?

00:32:49,642 --> 00:32:51,043
There was no
heater there.

00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:53,612
I found it in the living room,
melted.

00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:55,614
And I suppose
you happen to know

00:32:55,681 --> 00:32:57,483
which outlet
it was plugged into?

00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:58,617
It was a cold night.

00:32:58,684 --> 00:33:01,153
The outlet in the closet
was closest to her bed.

00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:04,557
That's a little far-fetched,
don't you think?

00:33:04,623 --> 00:33:05,791
Look...

00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:08,127
if this wire burned
from the inside out

00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:10,763
then the fire started
in the wall

00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:12,631
not on the closet floor.

00:33:16,902 --> 00:33:19,739
GRISSOM:
Discoloration throughout
the conductor.

00:33:19,805 --> 00:33:21,240
It burned from the inside out.

00:33:21,307 --> 00:33:25,344
The cause of this fire was an
electrical overload in the wall.

00:33:25,411 --> 00:33:26,946
All right, you say wall,
I say floor.

00:33:27,012 --> 00:33:28,314
We differ on points of origin.

00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:30,116
The jury's only going
to hear one word:

00:33:30,182 --> 00:33:31,217
gasoline.

00:33:31,283 --> 00:33:32,251
Speaking of which...

00:33:32,318 --> 00:33:33,853
where's your accelerant
analysis work?

00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:36,355
I personally swabbed
the closet floor

00:33:36,422 --> 00:33:38,824
found traces
of hydrocarbon chains

00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:40,760
confirming gasoline.

00:33:40,826 --> 00:33:43,429
Leave it alone, Gil.

00:33:43,496 --> 00:33:44,864
The D.A. agrees
with me on this.

00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:46,499
Too many
unanswered questions, Conrad.

00:33:46,565 --> 00:33:49,201
This case should <i>not</i>
be going to trial yet.

00:33:49,268 --> 00:33:50,970
No, there's only <i>one</i>
unanswered question.

00:33:51,037 --> 00:33:53,906
Why was there accelerant
in the closet?

00:33:53,973 --> 00:33:55,408
Only one person knows.

00:33:55,474 --> 00:33:58,411
And that's why he's looking
at the death penalty.

00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,649
DAMON:
<i>Look, I told you...</i>

00:34:03,716 --> 00:34:05,684
I don't know why it was there.

00:34:05,751 --> 00:34:06,952
You've got to do better
than that.

00:34:07,019 --> 00:34:07,953
I can't!

00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,055
It doesn't prove

00:34:09,121 --> 00:34:10,156
you didn't start it.

00:34:10,222 --> 00:34:12,024
Until we can explain
why there was gasoline

00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:13,292
in the bedroom closet

00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:15,528
the charges stand.

00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:19,492
Then I guess I'm a dead man.

00:34:28,965 --> 00:34:30,025
Hey, this is bull.

00:34:30,025 --> 00:34:31,092
I thought I was showing up

00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:32,093
to win a trip.

00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,228
CATHERINE:
Oh...

00:34:33,295 --> 00:34:35,297
one of you's going
to win a trip, all right.

00:34:35,363 --> 00:34:37,632
Everybody clear,
this is voluntary?

00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:40,602
Yeah, sure, then she
just calls the cops
to come and arrest us.

00:34:40,669 --> 00:34:43,538
So everyone <i>is</i> clear.

00:34:43,605 --> 00:34:44,840
Yeah.

00:34:44,906 --> 00:34:45,841
Yeah.

00:34:45,907 --> 00:34:47,275
Okay...

00:34:47,342 --> 00:34:49,945
here's what we're going to do.

00:34:50,011 --> 00:34:52,280
Open your nostrils.

00:34:52,347 --> 00:34:54,649
You know, look,
I got a hundred bucks

00:34:54,716 --> 00:34:56,485
that says none of us
are the shooter.

00:34:56,551 --> 00:34:59,121
Well, if you're that confident
it's not one of your guys

00:34:59,187 --> 00:35:00,288
you must know who it is.

00:35:00,355 --> 00:35:03,291
Even if I did,
you think I would tell you?

00:35:03,358 --> 00:35:05,360
NICK:
You're on

00:35:05,427 --> 00:35:07,429
Cool Breeze.
A hundred bucks.

00:35:07,496 --> 00:35:09,498
Okay.

00:35:12,934 --> 00:35:14,936
Head back.

00:35:35,991 --> 00:35:38,560
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:35:44,232 --> 00:35:47,302
Okay. You're all free to go.

00:35:47,369 --> 00:35:49,671
NICK:
This way, gents.

00:35:49,738 --> 00:35:51,640
You owe me a C-note, baby.

00:35:51,706 --> 00:35:52,674
I don't have it on me.

00:35:52,741 --> 00:35:54,009
I'll have to bring it to you.

00:35:54,075 --> 00:35:56,511
Okay, I'll be
holding my breath.

00:35:56,578 --> 00:35:58,580
Mm-hmm.

00:35:59,714 --> 00:36:02,551
Ugh!

00:36:06,488 --> 00:36:08,990
SARA:
Counting matches?

00:36:09,057 --> 00:36:11,660
Yeah.

00:36:11,726 --> 00:36:14,463
From the kid's room.

00:36:14,529 --> 00:36:16,565
I counted them yesterday.

00:36:16,631 --> 00:36:18,567
And I counted them
this morning.

00:36:18,633 --> 00:36:19,768
Twenty.

00:36:19,835 --> 00:36:20,969
They're all there.

00:36:25,073 --> 00:36:28,543
I really don't know
what I'm doing anymore.

00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:30,045
I got a theory.

00:36:30,111 --> 00:36:32,347
You want to hear it?

00:36:32,414 --> 00:36:33,582
Sure.

00:36:33,648 --> 00:36:35,484
You know the melted shards
of glass

00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:36,918
we found on the closet floor?

00:36:36,985 --> 00:36:38,520
They prove that
the fire burned

00:36:38,587 --> 00:36:40,088
at over 1,000
degrees, right?

00:36:40,155 --> 00:36:42,290
But that temp,
combined with the water

00:36:42,357 --> 00:36:43,758
used to douse the flames

00:36:43,825 --> 00:36:46,228
would have destroyed
most of the accelerant.

00:36:46,294 --> 00:36:48,897
That's what happens.

00:36:48,964 --> 00:36:50,732
So, Ecklie's conclusion
of gasoline

00:36:50,799 --> 00:36:52,734
wasn't based
on any physical evidence.

00:36:52,801 --> 00:36:55,070
It was based
on Damon's credit card receipts.

00:36:55,137 --> 00:36:56,371
I can't fault him for that.

00:36:56,438 --> 00:36:58,673
The burn pattern is consistent
with a gasoline accelerant.

00:36:58,740 --> 00:36:59,975
But...

00:37:00,041 --> 00:37:03,078
hydrocarbons are found
in all kinds of things: oils...

00:37:03,145 --> 00:37:05,714
kerosene,
polyethylene-
based compounds

00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:09,584
like laxatives, even the foam
used in push-up bras.

00:37:09,651 --> 00:37:11,787
Yeah, under the right conditions
<i>any</i> hydro-carb

00:37:11,853 --> 00:37:14,156
can be an accelerant.

00:37:14,222 --> 00:37:15,857
Thank you.

00:37:15,924 --> 00:37:17,125
Warrick, you're driving.

00:37:19,127 --> 00:37:21,229
You ever worry about
professional suicide?

00:37:21,296 --> 00:37:24,032
Not while I'm committing it, no.

00:37:39,314 --> 00:37:40,949
Crime scene cleanup.

00:37:41,016 --> 00:37:44,019
Let's go.

00:37:47,456 --> 00:37:49,124
You son of a bitch.

00:37:49,191 --> 00:37:50,459
You swept my crime scene.

00:37:50,525 --> 00:37:51,660
You sent cleanup!

00:37:51,726 --> 00:37:54,596
I didn't send anyone.

00:37:54,663 --> 00:37:56,031
It's been on the books
for months.

00:37:56,097 --> 00:37:57,399
You knew, and did
nothing about it

00:37:57,466 --> 00:37:58,834
even with a man's
life on the line?

00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:01,536
If you'd checked the docket
like everybody else

00:38:01,603 --> 00:38:03,138
you would've known
what was happening.

00:38:03,205 --> 00:38:04,339
Coffee?

00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:07,309
( <i>glass breaking</i> )

00:38:07,375 --> 00:38:09,010
Guess you don't want cream
with that.

00:38:29,698 --> 00:38:32,667
Thanks, Ecklie.

00:38:36,805 --> 00:38:38,240
Hi.

00:38:38,306 --> 00:38:39,674
Hi.

00:38:39,741 --> 00:38:41,409
Excuse me.

00:38:41,476 --> 00:38:42,878
My name's Gil Grissom.

00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:45,547
I know. You're helping
Frank. Thank you.

00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:46,915
May I ask you a question?

00:38:46,982 --> 00:38:49,885
Sure. Anything
to help Frank.

00:38:49,951 --> 00:38:52,154
You're his family.

00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:54,990
What was his relationship like
with his wife and son?

00:38:55,056 --> 00:38:59,361
Frank was a
wonderful father.

00:38:59,427 --> 00:39:01,830
Toby adored him.

00:39:01,897 --> 00:39:03,865
Uh, I'm sorry.

00:39:03,932 --> 00:39:07,269
I, um... I have to
get back to work.

00:39:07,335 --> 00:39:09,571
But thank you.

00:39:16,144 --> 00:39:18,980
I broke a coffee pot today.

00:39:19,047 --> 00:39:20,949
Lost my temper.

00:39:21,016 --> 00:39:23,385
Anything like that
ever happen to you?

00:39:25,687 --> 00:39:30,358
We found shards of
melted glass on the
floor of your closet.

00:39:30,425 --> 00:39:32,427
You want to tell
me about it?

00:39:34,529 --> 00:39:36,932
Okay, you can
explain it in court.

00:39:36,998 --> 00:39:39,401
It's all part of
the report now.

00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:56,118
I didn't leave that night
to buy ice cream.

00:39:58,053 --> 00:39:59,888
I was leaving Jeannie.

00:39:59,955 --> 00:40:00,889
I warned you.

00:40:00,956 --> 00:40:01,723
It's just a few things.

00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:03,291
It is half the damn state!

00:40:03,358 --> 00:40:04,793
I told you this was
the last time.

00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:05,827
Going to leave us now?

00:40:05,894 --> 00:40:07,796
I'm leaving.
You can be broke by yourself!

00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:10,065
You want to leave?
Fine, okay?

00:40:10,132 --> 00:40:12,834
Get out!
What the hell
are you doing?

00:40:12,901 --> 00:40:14,603
So I just got the hell
out of there.

00:40:14,669 --> 00:40:16,638
Drove for about 20 minutes

00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:20,075
and then thought,
how could I end ten years
of our life like that?

00:40:20,142 --> 00:40:22,577
I mean, we had a son,
so I turned around.

00:40:22,644 --> 00:40:24,045
Wait a minute. Go back.

00:40:24,112 --> 00:40:27,015
What did she throw at you?

00:40:27,082 --> 00:40:28,016
Be specific.

00:40:28,083 --> 00:40:29,985
Man, I just ducked and covered.

00:40:30,051 --> 00:40:31,153
I don't remember.

00:40:31,219 --> 00:40:32,187
Think.

00:40:32,254 --> 00:40:36,358
Uh... a-a phone.

00:40:36,424 --> 00:40:38,960
A-A bag.

00:40:39,027 --> 00:40:40,662
Uh, a vase maybe.

00:40:40,729 --> 00:40:41,696
What kind of a vase?

00:40:41,763 --> 00:40:43,365
A flower vase?

00:40:43,431 --> 00:40:44,866
I don't remember any flowers.

00:40:44,933 --> 00:40:46,434
Was it even a vase?

00:40:46,501 --> 00:40:47,903
Look, I don't know.

00:40:47,969 --> 00:40:48,937
I can't remember.

00:40:49,004 --> 00:40:50,505
Was it glass?

00:40:50,572 --> 00:40:52,774
Could it have
been glass?

00:40:52,841 --> 00:40:54,109
Yes.

00:40:54,176 --> 00:40:55,977
It was glass.

00:40:56,044 --> 00:40:59,181
It was a glass lamp,
because it had a wick.

00:40:59,247 --> 00:41:01,183
Get out!
What the hell are you doing?

00:41:01,249 --> 00:41:01,950
<i>Get out!</i>

00:41:02,017 --> 00:41:02,651
DAMON:
I'm leaving!

00:41:02,717 --> 00:41:04,786
Just get out!

00:41:04,853 --> 00:41:06,354
Like a kerosene lamp?

00:41:06,421 --> 00:41:08,123
Yeah, she bought a lamp
like that.

00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:10,725
I found kerosene on the
floor of your closet.

00:41:11,793 --> 00:41:13,829
I think the space heater
overloaded the circuit

00:41:13,895 --> 00:41:16,865
causing a spark to ignite
the kerosene.

00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:19,134
Can you prove it?

00:41:19,201 --> 00:41:20,135
In court?

00:41:20,202 --> 00:41:23,939
The evidence can.

00:41:33,381 --> 00:41:35,217
Hey, how you doing?

00:41:35,283 --> 00:41:36,651
Hey.

00:41:36,718 --> 00:41:37,719
Who do you want?

00:41:37,786 --> 00:41:40,989
The runner... um, 702.

00:41:41,056 --> 00:41:42,657
I owe him a little cash.

00:41:42,724 --> 00:41:44,593
Uh, this isn't the
only place he hangs out

00:41:44,659 --> 00:41:46,428
but if you want me
to give it to him...

00:41:46,495 --> 00:41:47,762
Um...

00:41:47,829 --> 00:41:49,531
you have an envelope
I could use?

00:41:49,598 --> 00:41:50,799
Yeah.

00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:54,102
( <i>sniffles</i> )

00:41:54,169 --> 00:41:55,437
Nice watch.

00:41:55,504 --> 00:41:57,139
Thanks.

00:41:57,205 --> 00:41:59,341
Thought you were getting out
of this business.

00:41:59,407 --> 00:42:01,376
Yeah, uh...
it's my last day.

00:42:01,443 --> 00:42:03,378
Got a new job.

00:42:03,445 --> 00:42:05,580
Later.

00:42:05,647 --> 00:42:06,815
Yeah.

00:42:06,882 --> 00:42:08,517
( <i>sneezes</i> )

00:42:23,632 --> 00:42:26,334
You're out of
business, Joey.

00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:30,272
( <i>sneezes</i> )

00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:33,542
New job, huh?

00:42:33,608 --> 00:42:36,278
Joey's old route?

00:42:38,747 --> 00:42:42,284
Did you get so scared
when you shot him

00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:44,286
that you forgot the money?

00:42:44,352 --> 00:42:46,555
I want a lawyer.

00:42:46,621 --> 00:42:50,058
Well, you better get one
that knows forensics...

00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:53,628
'cause we got you.

00:42:53,695 --> 00:42:56,131
Dispatch, Victor 19.

00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:59,468
Code 462
on the 4-20 suspect Monaco.

00:43:08,777 --> 00:43:10,846
Thought you might
need a ride.

00:43:10,912 --> 00:43:13,582
No. Thanks.

00:43:13,648 --> 00:43:15,917
DAMON:
I'm okay.

00:43:15,984 --> 00:43:19,020
Your sister.

00:43:24,025 --> 00:43:26,128
Who is she?

00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:31,032
Would you have helped me
if I told you

00:43:31,099 --> 00:43:33,301
that my wife and I
fought that night

00:43:33,368 --> 00:43:36,371
that I was leaving her
for another woman?

00:43:37,639 --> 00:43:39,374
For Rachel?

00:43:39,441 --> 00:43:42,377
I don't judge people.

00:43:42,444 --> 00:43:46,248
It's funny-- when I got out,
I thought I'd feel...

00:43:47,449 --> 00:43:49,384
free.

00:43:49,451 --> 00:43:51,720
And?

00:43:51,787 --> 00:43:53,655
I feel...

00:43:53,722 --> 00:43:56,158
Responsible?

00:44:07,369 --> 00:44:09,704
