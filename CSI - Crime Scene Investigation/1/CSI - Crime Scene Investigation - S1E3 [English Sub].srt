00:00:01,285 --> 00:00:03,153
<i>Previously on</i> CSI:

00:00:03,153 --> 00:00:04,587
Congratulations, Nicky, my boy.

00:00:04,587 --> 00:00:06,020
You are now
a CSI Level Three.

00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:07,221
Whoo!

00:00:07,221 --> 00:00:08,522
Mommy?

00:00:08,522 --> 00:00:10,057
I couldn’t drive here
fast enough

00:00:10,057 --> 00:00:11,323
to tell you how much I love you.

00:00:11,323 --> 00:00:12,724
I love you too.

00:00:12,724 --> 00:00:13,925
Sara Sidle?

00:00:13,925 --> 00:00:15,160
I know who I am.

00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,493
I think
you’re a little confused.

00:00:16,493 --> 00:00:18,528
I just off the phone
with the Sheriff.

00:00:18,528 --> 00:00:20,095
He says he wants me
to run the unit.

00:00:20,095 --> 00:00:21,429
You’re the boss.

00:00:21,429 --> 00:00:23,264
They say I got
to let you go.

00:00:23,264 --> 00:00:24,865
I know.

00:00:27,567 --> 00:00:29,101
I don’t care
what the book says.

00:00:29,101 --> 00:00:30,301
I lost one good person today.

00:00:30,301 --> 00:00:32,302
I don’t want
to lose another. Here.

00:01:17,261 --> 00:01:18,962
Oh...

00:01:18,962 --> 00:01:21,398
( <i>quivering wail</i> )

00:01:21,398 --> 00:01:23,299
( <i>screaming</i> )

00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,934
( <i>distorted male voice</i> ):
Bring $2 million in hundreds

00:01:27,934 --> 00:01:29,602
to Charleston and Third
in three hours,

00:01:29,602 --> 00:01:31,403
or your wife dies.

00:01:31,403 --> 00:01:33,971
Stop me from taking the money--
she still dies.

00:01:33,971 --> 00:01:35,539
This guy thinks
it’s some kind of joke

00:01:35,539 --> 00:01:37,039
using a voice like that.

00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:39,008
He’s altering
his voice, sir,
electronically.

00:01:39,008 --> 00:01:40,574
We don’t consider it
a joke at all.

00:01:40,574 --> 00:01:42,843
Bring $2 million in hundreds...

00:01:42,843 --> 00:01:44,844
You guys have listened
to that tape like, 20 times.

00:01:44,844 --> 00:01:46,678
Will somebody please go out
and find my wife?

00:01:46,678 --> 00:01:48,979
Mr. Garris, please, sometimes
if you listen closely,

00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:51,148
you can hear a lot.

00:01:51,148 --> 00:01:52,448
( <i>rewinds tape</i> )

00:01:52,448 --> 00:01:55,583
( <i>low frequency buzz</i> )

00:01:57,718 --> 00:01:59,352
I don’t hear anything.

00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:00,786
Right.

00:02:00,786 --> 00:02:02,954
Where do you hear nothing
in Las Vegas?

00:02:04,255 --> 00:02:06,289
The desert.

00:02:06,289 --> 00:02:08,424
And judging by
what sounds like

00:02:08,424 --> 00:02:11,592
a low frequency buzz
in the background,

00:02:11,592 --> 00:02:13,227
possibly near power lines.

00:02:13,227 --> 00:02:14,528
How’d you hear all that?

00:02:14,528 --> 00:02:16,529
I listen.

00:02:16,529 --> 00:02:18,663
Brass:
Right, okay,
all right, got it.

00:02:18,663 --> 00:02:19,964
I just spoke with the FBI.

00:02:19,964 --> 00:02:21,432
They’ll back us up
if we need it,

00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:22,666
but we have the handle.

00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:24,534
Garris:
Uh, Detective,
wait.

00:02:24,534 --> 00:02:26,335
What are my chances here...

00:02:26,335 --> 00:02:27,902
...of-of Laura...

00:02:27,902 --> 00:02:31,103
f-for Laura?

00:02:31,103 --> 00:02:32,571
It’s a three-hour window.

00:02:33,972 --> 00:02:35,940
Will somebody
just tell me the truth?

00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,974
A ransom message
with a short fuse

00:02:37,974 --> 00:02:39,808
means that
the victim’s situation

00:02:39,808 --> 00:02:41,543
will cause her to expire by

00:02:41,543 --> 00:02:43,210
or before
the deadline,

00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:44,845
regardless of
what we do.

00:02:44,845 --> 00:02:46,912
In a car trunk--
that kind of thing.

00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:48,547
It’s a form of passive murder,

00:02:48,547 --> 00:02:50,014
if you want to be, uh...

00:02:50,014 --> 00:02:51,515
honest
about it.

00:02:51,515 --> 00:02:53,016
Then you guys
have got to move.

00:02:53,016 --> 00:02:54,384
Grissom:
Mr. Garris,

00:02:54,384 --> 00:02:56,785
it’s my experience
that in situations like this,

00:02:56,785 --> 00:02:59,820
if you want to go fast,
go slow.

No, you’re in mine.

I wanted that.

hand-pick
to work here?

( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:04:14,196 --> 00:04:15,963
Keep telling yourself that.

00:04:18,265 --> 00:04:20,033
Get the lights, will you?

00:04:20,033 --> 00:04:21,500
Got it.

00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:34,608
Shady friends?

00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,709
No. Laura
surrounds herself

00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:39,311
with quality people,
people of real substance.

00:04:39,311 --> 00:04:40,711
Has her behavior
changed recently--

00:04:40,711 --> 00:04:42,278
drug use, alcohol,
things like that?

00:04:42,278 --> 00:04:43,613
No, no, no, nothing like that.

00:04:43,613 --> 00:04:45,114
She’s a health nut--
we both are.

00:04:45,114 --> 00:04:46,448
Uh-huh.

00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,784
Look, I’m a rich man.

00:04:51,784 --> 00:04:55,453
How do we let this guy know
I’ll pay?

00:04:55,453 --> 00:04:56,787
We don’t want
to go there yet.

00:04:58,555 --> 00:05:00,256
( <i>sighing</i> )

00:05:00,256 --> 00:05:02,357
Nick, tell lab

00:05:02,357 --> 00:05:04,358
to do a reverse algorithm
on that tape

00:05:04,358 --> 00:05:05,726
and then get it
into enhancement.

00:05:05,726 --> 00:05:07,660
Yeah, I know what to tell
the audio guy.

00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,728
You’ve been a Level Three
for what, two weeks?

00:05:09,728 --> 00:05:12,029
I got it
under control.

00:05:12,029 --> 00:05:13,430
Swear.

00:05:14,997 --> 00:05:16,732
Later.

00:05:24,637 --> 00:05:25,937
Cursory call--

00:05:25,937 --> 00:05:28,772
looks like a
professional job.

00:05:28,772 --> 00:05:32,374
Our guy bypasses
the security system,

00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:35,176
surprises the wife
in the back hall,

00:05:35,176 --> 00:05:36,543
drags her in here.

00:05:36,543 --> 00:05:38,911
She grabs onto
the doorway--
sign of struggle.

00:05:38,911 --> 00:05:40,646
No sign of sexual assault.

00:05:40,646 --> 00:05:43,047
He’s in, they’re out.

00:05:43,047 --> 00:05:46,815
Probably...egress
through those doors.

00:05:48,516 --> 00:05:51,985
Excuse me, is my evaluation
interrupting you?

00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:53,219
No, no, no.

00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:54,887
I barely heard you.

00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:56,888
Glad I have a healthy ego.

You find
something interesting there?

Dirt.

00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:05,126
You’re so technical,
I can hardly keep up, but...

00:06:05,126 --> 00:06:07,827
Oh, sorry, but, uh...

00:06:07,827 --> 00:06:11,296
out of context,
it’s...just dirt.

Did you just slap on
bad cologne?

00:06:25,137 --> 00:06:28,073
I never wear it.
It interferes with the job.

00:06:28,073 --> 00:06:29,774
It’s almost sweet.

We’ll confirm it
in GC mass spec.

"Looks like a professional job,"
I think you said.

Care to amend
your evaluation?

00:06:59,491 --> 00:07:00,892
I mean, if the guy
forgets the rag he used

00:07:00,892 --> 00:07:02,959
to knock her out,
he can’t be much of a pro.

the front is all concrete.

No dirt.

Context--there <i>is</i> dirt
on the carpeting inside.

In an otherwise
spotless house.

00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:25,105
You’re saying kidnapper
tracked the dirt in.

00:07:25,105 --> 00:07:26,739
Possible.

00:07:26,739 --> 00:07:28,740
As of now,
that’s about all we have, so...

00:07:29,874 --> 00:07:31,542
I guess we follow the dirt.

we had this year?

Warrick:
Too many.

One thing I can’t stand
is a punk coward.

00:07:52,021 --> 00:07:54,388
My daughter wants
one of these scooters.

00:07:54,388 --> 00:07:55,623
Says she’s the only kid

00:07:55,623 --> 00:07:57,990
in the world
who doesn’t have one.

00:08:02,793 --> 00:08:06,262
You want me
to take this case alone?

00:08:06,262 --> 00:08:07,563
You feeling all right, Warrick?

00:08:07,563 --> 00:08:09,030
Oh, I’m fine.

00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:12,666
I’m...I’m looking
after you.

00:08:16,568 --> 00:08:18,336
It’s that thing
with Holly Gribbs.

00:08:18,336 --> 00:08:20,037
It’s made me think

00:08:20,037 --> 00:08:22,671
of who I am to my partners,
you know?

00:08:22,671 --> 00:08:24,372
So this is what, your new leaf?

00:08:24,372 --> 00:08:26,707
You keep on busting on me,
you won’t see any kind of leaf.

00:08:26,707 --> 00:08:29,408
Hey, relax, I’ll play nice.

00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:30,676
Thank you for the offer.

00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:34,811
I’m okay.
I can handle this one.

00:08:34,811 --> 00:08:36,712
It’d be nice
if this paint transfer

00:08:36,712 --> 00:08:38,848
had just one special property.

00:08:41,282 --> 00:08:42,816
You want to call it?

down Rochester.

the vic was thrown--

00:08:57,324 --> 00:08:59,692
what, 20 meters?

00:09:02,027 --> 00:09:04,062
And all we’ve got is some paint
that’s gonna match up

00:09:04,062 --> 00:09:06,629
to about 20 million
other vehicles.

00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:09,065
Yeah.

00:09:09,065 --> 00:09:10,566
Bastard.

00:09:10,566 --> 00:09:13,833
Are you ordering me
not to pay the ransom?

00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,969
It’s a very strong suggestion,
yes.

00:09:15,969 --> 00:09:18,303
After you told me she could
already be dead?

00:09:18,303 --> 00:09:19,771
I don’t believe you guys.

00:09:19,771 --> 00:09:21,538
This is my wife.

00:09:21,538 --> 00:09:22,739
I’m paying the ransom.

00:09:22,739 --> 00:09:24,139
Look, if you
give up the cash,

00:09:24,139 --> 00:09:26,508
the kidnapper has no reason
to communicate with us.

00:09:26,508 --> 00:09:28,809
Does anyone on your team
know where Laura is right now?

00:09:28,809 --> 00:09:31,110
We have an entire forensics lab
working on this.

00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:34,812
Yeah? Something tells me
I’ll see her before you do.

00:09:34,812 --> 00:09:37,214
Well, your job
just got harder.

00:09:37,214 --> 00:09:38,515
Yeah.

00:09:38,515 --> 00:09:39,915
I’ll stay close
to the money.

This dirt has
interesting properties.

The gold flecks--
that’s easy, it’s gold.

00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,089
The little gray
squiggles?

00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:52,289
Cyanide.

00:09:52,289 --> 00:09:54,291
Cyanide?
He poisoned her.

00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:55,757
No.

00:09:55,757 --> 00:09:57,558
Did you know
that Nevada produces 80%

00:09:57,558 --> 00:09:58,859
of the country’s gold?

00:09:58,859 --> 00:10:01,528
Miners drop cyanide powder
into the dirt

00:10:01,528 --> 00:10:03,096
and it draws the gold
to the surface.

00:10:03,096 --> 00:10:04,663
And how does
a bug specialist

00:10:04,663 --> 00:10:05,863
know so much about dirt?

00:10:05,863 --> 00:10:07,464
I had a case five years ago.

00:10:07,464 --> 00:10:09,665
We found a skeleton
in an abandoned gold mine.

00:10:09,665 --> 00:10:10,933
I thought it was a murder.

00:10:10,933 --> 00:10:13,768
Turned out the guy
passed out drunk

00:10:13,768 --> 00:10:17,270
and the cyanide leached
into his system.

00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,971
Gruesome, Grissom.

00:10:20,271 --> 00:10:21,939
You know, it’s funny,
but every case

00:10:21,939 --> 00:10:23,673
teaches me something
about the next.

00:10:23,673 --> 00:10:25,308
So when you said,
"follow the dirt"...?

00:10:25,308 --> 00:10:28,110
Gold mine--it’s possible
that’s where he’s got her.

00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:30,277
Great, there’s got to be
100 gold mines in Nevada.

00:10:30,277 --> 00:10:32,012
True, but how many

00:10:32,012 --> 00:10:35,180
are near power lines
within range of the drop zone?

00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:37,048
Three.

00:10:37,048 --> 00:10:39,182
One, two,

00:10:39,182 --> 00:10:40,817
three.

00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:45,620
This is your
hit-and-run victim.

00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,021
Bad thing about this job is,

00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:49,088
you stop asking yourself why.

00:10:51,823 --> 00:10:53,691
Here’s the bruise
I was telling you about.

00:10:56,259 --> 00:10:57,393
You see it?

00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:04,697
( <i>girl screams</i> )

00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:08,766
Oh, my God.

00:11:08,766 --> 00:11:10,234
Plate numbers.

00:11:10,234 --> 00:11:13,969
From the license plate
when it impacted her skin.

00:11:13,969 --> 00:11:16,237
Looks like a "four"

00:11:16,237 --> 00:11:17,438
and a "J."

00:11:17,438 --> 00:11:18,972
Yeah.

00:11:18,972 --> 00:11:20,706
Not like he left us
any evidence.

00:11:20,706 --> 00:11:22,507
Call DMV.

00:11:22,507 --> 00:11:23,808
I’ll get them
to cross-check

00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,676
this partial
within a five-mile radius,

00:11:25,676 --> 00:11:27,077
see how many ideas
they come up with.

00:11:27,077 --> 00:11:30,446
You’ll have those
pictures for me?
Yep.

00:11:30,446 --> 00:11:31,679
I’ll meet you out front.

00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:33,647
All right.

00:11:39,184 --> 00:11:40,784
Freaky.

00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:42,452
Is that what I think it is?

00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:44,186
It’s a pack of coyotes.

00:11:44,186 --> 00:11:46,621
The sensor picks up
any form of body heat,

00:11:46,621 --> 00:11:48,389
two-legged or four-legged.

00:12:16,972 --> 00:12:19,440
Captain Brass. Hey.

00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,774
Geez, you scared me.

00:12:20,774 --> 00:12:22,041
Sorry. Sorry.

00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,342
Grissom told me
to hook up with you.

00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:25,743
He says the drop place
will be a crime scene.

00:12:25,743 --> 00:12:27,111
We hope.

00:12:32,414 --> 00:12:35,949
Come on, give us
something two-legged.

00:12:38,651 --> 00:12:41,019
Last mine,
we’ve circled it twice.

00:12:41,019 --> 00:12:43,120
Yeah, well, we’ll
circle it again.

00:12:51,758 --> 00:12:54,427
Why don’t they
move in on the guy?

00:12:54,427 --> 00:12:57,395
Why? ’Cause he’s probably
just walking his dog.

00:12:57,395 --> 00:13:00,163
Nick:
Well, he’s been there
five minutes.

00:13:01,731 --> 00:13:02,964
Dogs take their time.

00:13:02,964 --> 00:13:05,033
What, do you want
to be rushed?

00:13:05,033 --> 00:13:07,901
Man on Radio:
Male in a ball cap, 10:00.

00:13:12,437 --> 00:13:15,005
Here, kitty, kitty...

00:13:15,005 --> 00:13:16,606
Nobody moves, you got that?

00:13:16,606 --> 00:13:18,407
Rock solid till my order.

00:13:18,407 --> 00:13:19,808
Man: Copy.

00:13:32,581 --> 00:13:33,782
What was that?

00:13:33,782 --> 00:13:37,218
Go back.
Where?

00:13:37,218 --> 00:13:38,952
Grissom:
There. Swing around!

00:13:44,588 --> 00:13:46,456
My God, she’s below
the surface.

00:13:46,456 --> 00:13:47,724
Okay, let’s land!

00:13:47,724 --> 00:13:49,891
Take her down! Down!

00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,461
Ground team is
right behind us.

00:13:54,461 --> 00:13:55,862
I’ll guide them in.

00:13:58,563 --> 00:13:59,831
She’s got to be right up here.

00:13:59,831 --> 00:14:01,565
Mrs. Garris!
Mrs. Garris!

00:14:01,565 --> 00:14:03,166
Can you hear us?

00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:04,567
Mrs. Garris!

00:14:04,567 --> 00:14:08,736
We’re with the Las Vegas
Police Department!

00:14:08,736 --> 00:14:11,270
( <i>muffled screaming</i> )

00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,471
Here!

00:14:12,471 --> 00:14:13,972
She’s here!

00:14:22,977 --> 00:14:24,178
Got something here.

00:14:24,178 --> 00:14:26,779
( <i>sirens approaching</i> )

00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:35,517
Come on!
Get that end!

00:14:35,517 --> 00:14:37,018
Yeah, come over!

00:14:40,787 --> 00:14:41,988
Got to get her air!

00:14:41,988 --> 00:14:43,789
Give me a pick,
an ax.

00:14:48,459 --> 00:14:49,792
Pull it!

00:14:55,563 --> 00:14:57,264
Oh, my God.

00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:00,866
Somebody get up
behind her.

00:15:03,467 --> 00:15:05,368
Okay, we’re gonna
pull her up.

00:15:07,936 --> 00:15:09,871
Sara, get me something
to cut this tape.

00:15:09,871 --> 00:15:11,238
Are you okay?

00:15:13,673 --> 00:15:15,440
You’re gonna
be okay now.

00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,775
Get this off.

00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:21,177
Okay.

00:15:29,515 --> 00:15:31,016
You okay?

00:15:31,016 --> 00:15:32,317
Never ceases
to amaze me

00:15:32,317 --> 00:15:35,285
what people
do to each other.

00:15:35,285 --> 00:15:38,120
Transport the box
to the lab for latents.

00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,621
Hair fibers, get soil...

00:15:39,621 --> 00:15:40,889
Victor-18.

00:15:40,889 --> 00:15:43,590
Brass, do you hear me?

00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:45,257
Brass: Copy.

00:15:45,257 --> 00:15:47,859
We got the package
and she’s still alive.

00:15:47,859 --> 00:15:49,360
Brass, are you reading me? Over.

00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,628
Victor-9, affirmative.
Way to go.

00:15:51,628 --> 00:15:53,296
Major player
is in our sight.

00:15:53,296 --> 00:15:55,763
Will update. Out.

00:15:55,763 --> 00:15:57,164
You think that’s him?

00:15:57,164 --> 00:16:00,166
You think that’s
our guy right there?

00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:09,871
Move on ball cap!
Move, move, move!

00:16:09,871 --> 00:16:12,573
( <i>siren blasts</i> )

00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,241
Police officers, freeze!

00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:17,275
Hey, no, I wasn’t stealing
the bag, all right?

00:16:17,275 --> 00:16:19,811
Hands on your head.
Down on your knees!

00:16:19,811 --> 00:16:21,078
Hold still.

00:16:21,078 --> 00:16:23,113
Suspect:
Hey, look at the bag.

00:16:23,113 --> 00:16:24,647
It’s not even leather.

00:16:24,647 --> 00:16:26,581
Why would I want it?

00:16:26,581 --> 00:16:29,116
I can think of about
two million reasons, Tiger.

00:16:30,883 --> 00:16:33,519
( <i>distant siren wailing</i> )

00:16:46,859 --> 00:16:49,128
( <i>doorbell rings</i> )

00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:55,464
Hello.

00:16:55,464 --> 00:16:57,098
Can I help you folks?

00:16:57,098 --> 00:16:58,799
Mr. Charles Moore?

00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:01,401
We’re with the
Las Vegas Crime Lab.

00:17:01,401 --> 00:17:05,003
We’d like to talk
to you about your car.

00:17:05,003 --> 00:17:06,371
We believe it may
have been involved

00:17:06,371 --> 00:17:08,772
in a traffic collision
earlier this evening.

00:17:08,772 --> 00:17:13,007
I told the police when they
called, my car was stolen.

00:17:13,007 --> 00:17:16,443
That’s why we have
a search warrant, sir...

00:17:18,878 --> 00:17:20,278
So that we can look
in your garage.

00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:38,456
It--it was an accident.

00:17:38,456 --> 00:17:40,623
I saw the girl
and I tried to break,

00:17:40,623 --> 00:17:44,625
but I accelerated
by mistake.

00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:46,026
I get confused.

00:17:47,161 --> 00:17:48,562
I--I shouldn’t have left.

00:17:48,562 --> 00:17:50,129
I was wrong.

00:17:51,964 --> 00:17:53,230
Is she okay?

00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:55,399
She died at the scene.

00:17:55,399 --> 00:17:58,000
Oh, my God.

00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,668
Warrick:
You’re going
to be charged

00:17:59,668 --> 00:18:02,570
with manslaughter,
Mr. Moore.

00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:06,972
A felony hit-and-run.

00:18:06,972 --> 00:18:10,007
Do you have a lawyer?

00:18:13,742 --> 00:18:16,478
Catherine, I just
got off the phone
with the traffic guys.

00:18:16,478 --> 00:18:17,978
They’ve impounded
Moore’s car.

00:18:17,978 --> 00:18:19,645
Should be here
any minute.

00:18:19,645 --> 00:18:20,946
Catherine:
Is it me,

00:18:20,946 --> 00:18:22,947
or did he give
it up too easy?

00:18:22,947 --> 00:18:24,582
Old guy was scared.

00:18:24,582 --> 00:18:26,016
Grissom:
You have to see

00:18:26,016 --> 00:18:28,217
the birthday present
I got for your daughter.

00:18:28,217 --> 00:18:30,051
What’s the rule?
How long do I have to be here

00:18:30,051 --> 00:18:31,652
before I start kicking in
for gifts?

00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:32,853
When the spirit moves you, Sara.

00:18:32,853 --> 00:18:35,188
So, in your case,
I guess, never.

00:18:35,188 --> 00:18:37,155
I got one of these
chem labs when I was six.

00:18:37,155 --> 00:18:39,057
I almost blew up
the whole house.

00:18:39,057 --> 00:18:40,591
I hope you can return it,

00:18:40,591 --> 00:18:42,392
’cause, uh, Lindsey
doesn’t want a party.

00:18:42,392 --> 00:18:43,959
Yeah, what kid
doesn’t want a party?

00:18:43,959 --> 00:18:45,327
My kid.
Nick:
Hey, Catherine

00:18:45,327 --> 00:18:47,028
what time’s your
little girl coming by?

00:18:47,028 --> 00:18:48,229
She isn’t.

00:18:48,229 --> 00:18:50,097
Yeah, but I got her a chem set.

00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,898
You keep that;
might learn something.

00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:55,233
Stop flirting with me.
Cath, really, when’s the party?

00:18:55,233 --> 00:18:57,201
What do I have to do--put it
on the bulletin board?

00:18:57,201 --> 00:18:58,435
There is no party.

00:18:58,435 --> 00:18:59,935
My daughter doesn’t
want a party.

00:18:59,935 --> 00:19:02,004
Is everybody clear on that?

00:19:02,004 --> 00:19:04,505
( <i>several pagers beeping</i> )

00:19:04,505 --> 00:19:05,739
Our car’s here.

00:19:05,739 --> 00:19:07,039
The burial box
is in.

00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,308
The victim’s ready
at Desert Palm.

00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:12,075
We’ll play with
these later.

No problem.

"Garris Winery."

00:19:28,152 --> 00:19:31,286
And you never
saw the person, huh?

00:19:31,286 --> 00:19:35,389
He...grabbed me from behind.

00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:41,326
There was something
clamped over my mouth.

00:19:41,326 --> 00:19:44,028
That’s the last thing
that I remember.

00:19:44,028 --> 00:19:45,461
You know how
you got the bruising

00:19:45,461 --> 00:19:47,696
around your eye?

00:19:47,696 --> 00:19:50,932
I have no idea.

00:19:50,932 --> 00:19:52,132
I’m sorry.

00:19:52,132 --> 00:19:54,700
I was knocked out.

00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,335
( <i>shuddering breath</i> )

00:19:56,335 --> 00:19:58,202
I just don’t think
I can help you.

00:19:58,202 --> 00:20:00,370
She’s been through enough;
can we cut this short?

00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:02,071
Sure.

00:20:02,071 --> 00:20:05,873
I’d like to get a blood sample
from you, though, if I could.

00:20:05,873 --> 00:20:07,274
What for?

00:20:07,274 --> 00:20:09,475
You’ve got scratches
on your arm.

If we can find traces
of your blood in Rundle’s truck,

00:20:12,577 --> 00:20:14,611
we can match the DNA,

00:20:14,611 --> 00:20:16,712
make our case against him
that much stronger.

00:20:16,712 --> 00:20:19,248
Come on, Grissom,
you have the guy.
Isn’t that enough?

00:20:19,248 --> 00:20:22,115
Yeah, well, we didn’t get
any prints off the duct tape.

00:20:22,115 --> 00:20:24,117
Our audio guys are
working on stuff.

00:20:24,117 --> 00:20:25,885
Right now, we need
something more concrete

00:20:25,885 --> 00:20:29,153
if we want to prove
that he did it.

00:20:29,153 --> 00:20:30,620
I want to help, Jack.

00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,388
Okay, all right.

00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,991
Whatever it takes

00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:41,360
to put this guy behind bars,

00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,727
I’ll do.

00:21:21,349 --> 00:21:24,351
So you want to talk to us,
no lawyer?

00:21:24,351 --> 00:21:25,752
Why would I need a lawyer?

00:21:25,752 --> 00:21:27,120
Look, I told you,

00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,121
I didn’t know there was
any money in that bag.

00:21:30,121 --> 00:21:31,622
Hit balls at that park
twice a week.

00:21:31,622 --> 00:21:32,923
Ask around.

00:21:32,923 --> 00:21:35,057
And the fact that you’re
Jack Garris’s trainer?

00:21:35,057 --> 00:21:37,058
How does that mean
I kidnapped his wife?

00:21:37,058 --> 00:21:38,626
I know the dude.

00:21:38,626 --> 00:21:40,060
Yeah.

00:21:42,095 --> 00:21:44,296
And the layout
of the guy’s house.

00:21:44,296 --> 00:21:46,464
He pays extra for me
to come to him.

00:21:46,464 --> 00:21:48,465
You want to explain why
we found your fingerprints

00:21:48,465 --> 00:21:50,666
all over the crate
Laura Garris was
buried in?

00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:53,134
I... look, unless it was

00:21:53,134 --> 00:21:55,169
from Jack’s vineyard,
I don’t know.

00:21:55,169 --> 00:21:56,503
Helped him move
some crates

00:21:56,503 --> 00:21:59,838
a couple weeks ago
up to his garage.

00:21:59,838 --> 00:22:01,006
I can’t believe...

00:22:01,006 --> 00:22:03,107
Y-y-you got nothing
to hold me on.

00:22:03,107 --> 00:22:04,741
Going once, going twice...

00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:08,343
sold...to the man walking
out the front door.

00:22:09,211 --> 00:22:11,012
Don’t go too far, pal.

00:22:11,012 --> 00:22:12,646
My lawyer’s number.

00:22:12,646 --> 00:22:15,380
In case you’d like
to communicate
with me again.

00:22:17,348 --> 00:22:18,916
Hey, didn’t I see you
on the news tonight?

00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:22,218
The chopper, you were
digging up Jack’s wife?

00:22:22,218 --> 00:22:23,752
It’s amazing.

00:22:23,752 --> 00:22:25,053
Hope you catch the guy.

00:22:25,053 --> 00:22:26,621
Me too.

00:22:28,955 --> 00:22:30,289
So?

00:22:30,289 --> 00:22:32,924
Ah, kid didn’t give up
a thing...

00:22:32,924 --> 00:22:34,825
except the tape that’ll
break the case open.

00:22:34,825 --> 00:22:36,759
Did you let him know
you were recording him?

00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:38,961
Yeah, the guy has no idea
what you science types

00:22:38,961 --> 00:22:40,228
can do with
a little audio tape.

00:22:40,228 --> 00:22:42,129
Thank you.

00:22:47,465 --> 00:22:49,667
How tall you do you
think Mr. Moore is?

00:22:49,667 --> 00:22:50,867
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:22:50,867 --> 00:22:52,468
Six feet, I’d say.

00:22:52,468 --> 00:22:54,770
Well, old people must love
hugging that steering wheel

00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:57,071
’cause this seat is pushed
all the way forward.

00:22:59,705 --> 00:23:01,541
Oh!

00:23:01,541 --> 00:23:02,707
Oh...

00:23:04,742 --> 00:23:05,809
Well, I’m six feet,

00:23:05,809 --> 00:23:07,677
and this mirror isn’t
helping me at all.

00:23:09,745 --> 00:23:11,012
Start the car.

00:23:11,012 --> 00:23:12,213
Why?

00:23:12,213 --> 00:23:13,547
Just do it.

00:23:14,781 --> 00:23:16,015
( <i>engine starts</i> )

00:23:16,015 --> 00:23:19,451
( <i>loud rap music plays</i> )

00:23:19,451 --> 00:23:22,485
Mr. Moore was not the last
person to drive this car.

00:23:22,485 --> 00:23:25,487
( <i>music continues</i> )

00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:28,989
Uh, turn the music off.

00:23:28,989 --> 00:23:30,690
This?
Yeah.

00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:32,558
It’s good stuff.

00:23:32,558 --> 00:23:36,026
Nobody over 19 was
the last person
to drive this car.

00:23:36,026 --> 00:23:37,527
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:23:37,527 --> 00:23:39,662
Yeah.

00:23:39,662 --> 00:23:41,229
Hey, just in time.

00:23:41,229 --> 00:23:43,598
We’re giving it
a final run.

00:23:43,598 --> 00:23:45,532
Man ( <i>garbled, over computer</i> ):
Bring $2 million in hundreds

00:23:45,532 --> 00:23:47,167
to Charleston and Third
in three hours

00:23:47,167 --> 00:23:48,868
or your wife dies.

00:23:48,868 --> 00:23:51,402
Stop me from taking the money--
she still dies.

00:23:51,402 --> 00:23:55,704
This is the end of the same tape
after a reverse algorithmic.

00:23:55,704 --> 00:23:58,273
Man ( <i>clearly, over computer</i> ):
Stop me from taking the money--

00:23:58,273 --> 00:23:59,940
she still dies.

00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,108
Sounds like our guy to me.

00:24:01,108 --> 00:24:02,575
It is.

00:24:02,575 --> 00:24:04,610
Now, ransom tape
against your exemplar.

00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,210
You got it
loaded up, THD?

00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:08,079
Right here.

00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:11,280
Rundle:
Look, unless it was from
Jack’s vineyard, I don’t know.

00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,081
Helped him move some crates
couple weeks ago

00:24:13,081 --> 00:24:14,282
up to his garage.

00:24:14,282 --> 00:24:15,983
Survey says...

00:24:15,983 --> 00:24:18,585
perfect match
to the naked ear.

00:24:18,585 --> 00:24:20,819
Now, where’s my spectrograph,
so the defense attorneys

00:24:20,819 --> 00:24:24,754
can’t claim that our
alterations were altered?

00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:26,489
Right here.

00:24:26,489 --> 00:24:28,790
Uh, yellow lines
with the ransom message--

00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:30,091
blue’s the interview.

00:24:30,091 --> 00:24:31,458
( <i>beeping</i> )

00:24:33,959 --> 00:24:35,294
Nick:
There’s something wrong.

00:24:35,294 --> 00:24:36,528
There’s just a green line.

00:24:36,528 --> 00:24:37,829
That’s ’cause the blue line

00:24:37,829 --> 00:24:39,396
is directly on top
of the yellow line,

00:24:39,396 --> 00:24:40,930
which makes it green.

00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:42,231
It’s a perfect match.

00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:43,432
We got our kidnapper.

00:24:43,432 --> 00:24:45,166
What do you
do now, Nick?

00:24:45,166 --> 00:24:46,634
I’ll call Brass,
tell him to go

00:24:46,634 --> 00:24:49,135
pick the guy up.
But you tell Brass
to drag his heels,

00:24:49,135 --> 00:24:50,436
’cause you still
got work to do.

00:24:50,436 --> 00:24:52,237
Grissom, can you look
at something out back?

00:24:52,237 --> 00:24:53,638
Could be big.

00:24:53,638 --> 00:24:54,671
Yeah.

00:24:54,671 --> 00:24:56,672
Come see me
after you raise Brass.

00:24:59,874 --> 00:25:01,242
What’d I do wrong?

00:25:01,242 --> 00:25:02,676
I’m not gonna spoil
Grissom’s fun.

00:25:02,676 --> 00:25:05,845
This is how he teaches
all you guys.

00:25:05,845 --> 00:25:09,246
Does anybody else
drive your car,
Mr. Moore?

00:25:09,246 --> 00:25:10,647
I was driving yesterday.

00:25:10,647 --> 00:25:13,182
Sir, that doesn’t answer
our question.

00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:16,851
Boy:
Pops...

00:25:16,851 --> 00:25:19,052
Hey, you okay?

00:25:19,052 --> 00:25:21,153
What’s he doing here?

00:25:21,153 --> 00:25:22,721
Your grandson is
an approved driver

00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:24,322
on your insurance.

00:25:24,322 --> 00:25:26,223
We had him pulled out of school.

00:25:27,257 --> 00:25:30,459
So, James, you like Mos Def?

00:25:35,529 --> 00:25:37,763
Did you hit that girl
with your grandfather’s car?

00:25:41,965 --> 00:25:44,033
Pops, let me explain to them.
No.

00:25:44,033 --> 00:25:45,267
They should hear what happened.

00:25:45,267 --> 00:25:47,468
They’re going to...
from me.

00:25:52,204 --> 00:25:54,705
I asked James to drive with me.

00:25:54,705 --> 00:25:58,007
I don’t do so good,
night driving.

00:25:58,007 --> 00:25:59,775
When I hit that girl,

00:25:59,775 --> 00:26:03,945
I got knocked woozy,
and James switched seats

00:26:03,945 --> 00:26:05,679
and took over
the wheel...

00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:07,113
got me home.

00:26:07,113 --> 00:26:11,215
He was worried about me,
not the girl.

00:26:11,215 --> 00:26:15,251
One more moving violation,
and they take away my keys.

00:26:16,385 --> 00:26:20,487
I’m not saying
good judgment was used,

00:26:20,487 --> 00:26:23,756
but that’s what happened.

00:26:23,756 --> 00:26:26,358
James, you want to add
anything to that?

00:26:28,125 --> 00:26:30,426
No.

00:26:30,426 --> 00:26:32,361
That’s how it was.

00:26:36,229 --> 00:26:37,664
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:26:37,664 --> 00:26:40,766
Will you please
escort Mr. Moore
back to his cell?

00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:43,733
Sir.

00:26:45,535 --> 00:26:48,970
I’ll come see you
with a lawyer.

00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:50,872
Just not
during school hours.

00:26:50,872 --> 00:26:52,305
I won’t.

00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,747
James.

00:27:06,747 --> 00:27:08,648
You have family,
someone you can call?

00:27:08,648 --> 00:27:10,283
It’s just the two of us.

00:27:10,283 --> 00:27:12,050
We can give you
a lift home.

00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:15,386
Thanks--no.

00:27:15,386 --> 00:27:16,919
I’ll take the bus.

00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:24,957
You know that James
was riding solo that night.

00:27:27,158 --> 00:27:30,194
Like I know my
middle name.

00:27:30,194 --> 00:27:32,962
Well, let’s go
back to the car
and find the proof.

00:27:36,631 --> 00:27:38,032
What?

00:27:38,032 --> 00:27:40,200
It’s just that we’ve got
so much power in this job,

00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,834
which we use to get
the bad guys.

00:27:41,834 --> 00:27:44,302
Once in a while, I’d like
to use it to help the good guys,

00:27:44,302 --> 00:27:47,904
like Mr. Moore and his grandson.

00:27:47,904 --> 00:27:50,772
And what, forget about
little Renda Harris?

00:27:50,772 --> 00:27:52,507
No...

00:27:54,174 --> 00:27:56,575
What I’m saying is that...

00:27:56,575 --> 00:27:59,277
putting James away isn’t
gonna bring her back.

00:27:59,277 --> 00:28:02,312
Mr. Moore is willing
to do the time.

00:28:02,312 --> 00:28:05,447
And the victim’s family
gets closure.

00:28:05,447 --> 00:28:09,349
Hey, you don’t think
I’m feeling this?

00:28:09,349 --> 00:28:11,083
But we got to follow
the evidence,

00:28:11,083 --> 00:28:13,685
even if we don’t like
where it takes us.

00:28:16,754 --> 00:28:17,987
It’s the job.

00:28:19,822 --> 00:28:21,023
Yeah.

00:28:21,023 --> 00:28:22,357
I know it.

00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:26,359
Hey, we start making
deals with the Devil

00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:29,261
and you don’t get
to walk away.

00:28:29,261 --> 00:28:30,862
You understand
what I’m saying?

00:28:30,862 --> 00:28:32,330
Yeah.

00:28:34,297 --> 00:28:35,765
Momentary lapse.

00:28:39,534 --> 00:28:42,068
Grissom:
<i>I want you to find something</i>
<i>new on that tape.</i>

00:28:42,068 --> 00:28:43,269
Like what?

00:28:43,269 --> 00:28:44,703
We already matched
the guy’s voice.

00:28:44,703 --> 00:28:46,871
You know what the defense
attorneys will do with that?

00:28:46,871 --> 00:28:48,539
That’s who you’re
up against in the end.

00:28:48,539 --> 00:28:50,373
You think I don’t
know that?

00:28:50,373 --> 00:28:53,141
Ah, you been second-
guessing me ever since
I got on this case.

00:28:53,141 --> 00:28:54,475
People leave us clues, Nick.

00:28:54,475 --> 00:28:56,376
They speak to us in
thousands of different ways.

00:28:56,376 --> 00:28:58,077
It’s our job to make sure
that we’ve heard

00:28:58,077 --> 00:28:59,278
everything they’ve said.

00:28:59,278 --> 00:29:00,712
Anything less is
reasonable doubt.

00:29:00,712 --> 00:29:02,580
I’ll go back
to the tape.

00:29:05,782 --> 00:29:07,583
You any better?

00:29:07,583 --> 00:29:08,816
What are you talking about?

00:29:08,816 --> 00:29:11,885
Your little
major-minor blow-up

00:29:11,885 --> 00:29:14,387
about Lindsey not wanting
a party.

00:29:14,387 --> 00:29:16,221
Oh, that.

00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:18,256
Yeah.

00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:19,823
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:29:19,823 --> 00:29:23,992
I’m just afraid that I’m
making her weird, you know?

00:29:23,992 --> 00:29:25,193
No.

00:29:25,193 --> 00:29:27,527
I work 24/7.

00:29:27,527 --> 00:29:29,628
I have no time
for my friends.

00:29:29,628 --> 00:29:33,531
My daughter rarely
sees me having any fun,

00:29:33,531 --> 00:29:37,467
and all of a sudden,
she doesn’t want a party.

00:29:37,467 --> 00:29:38,934
And that’s because of you?

00:29:38,934 --> 00:29:40,234
Yes, I’m her mother.

00:29:40,234 --> 00:29:42,303
She mimics me.

00:29:42,303 --> 00:29:44,904
Well, then
she’ll be fine.

00:29:44,904 --> 00:29:46,705
I mean, look at you.

00:29:49,139 --> 00:29:51,941
You’re just saying that
to make me feel better.

00:29:51,941 --> 00:29:54,142
Yeah.

00:29:54,142 --> 00:29:55,377
Hey, Grissom...

00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:56,878
could you come tape me up?

00:29:59,212 --> 00:30:00,646
I love my work.

00:30:00,646 --> 00:30:02,481
It shows.

00:30:04,982 --> 00:30:06,516
( <i>tape rips</i> )

00:30:10,252 --> 00:30:13,687
So you found Laura’s
hairs here...

00:30:13,687 --> 00:30:15,922
passenger side,
front seat?

00:30:15,922 --> 00:30:17,590
Right, not in the back.

00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:19,724
Which made me ask,
what kind of a kidnapper

00:30:19,724 --> 00:30:22,025
puts a woman bound
and unconscious

00:30:22,025 --> 00:30:23,593
in the front seat?

00:30:23,593 --> 00:30:26,028
The back of my arm isn’t
touching the sheepskin, see?

00:30:26,028 --> 00:30:27,796
Yeah, so?

00:30:27,796 --> 00:30:30,963
But there is sheepskin fiber
on the back of Laura’s sleeve.

00:30:30,963 --> 00:30:34,499
That tells us Laura sat back
like a normal person would.

00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:36,000
Cut me, Mick.

00:30:40,036 --> 00:30:41,804
Like this.

00:30:41,804 --> 00:30:43,204
So she wasn’t bound at all?

00:30:43,204 --> 00:30:44,671
Correct.

00:30:44,671 --> 00:30:48,874
But would a kidnapper risk
putting an unconscious woman

00:30:48,874 --> 00:30:51,309
in the front seat
of his car, even unbound?

00:30:51,309 --> 00:30:52,843
Answer is usually
in the question--

00:30:52,843 --> 00:30:54,044
you taught me that.

00:30:54,044 --> 00:30:56,512
So was she unconscious?

00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:58,546
We found halothane on the patio.

00:30:58,546 --> 00:31:01,248
Halothane knocks you out,
if you take it.

00:31:01,248 --> 00:31:04,449
So you’re saying she never
inhaled the halothane?

00:31:04,449 --> 00:31:05,817
Proof would be in her blood.

00:31:05,817 --> 00:31:08,552
Halothane stays in the system
up to 48 hours.

00:31:08,552 --> 00:31:09,786
How pleased am I that I got

00:31:09,786 --> 00:31:12,554
a sample of
her blood?

00:31:12,554 --> 00:31:13,955
So you can go check at the lab,

00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:15,123
see how it turned out.

00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:17,890
Damn it, I wanted to carry
the ball over the line.

00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:19,558
I know.

00:31:19,558 --> 00:31:21,559
We just picked up
our kidnapper, Chip.

00:31:21,559 --> 00:31:23,127
What’s up?

00:31:23,127 --> 00:31:25,328
His lawyer was at his house
and wants to make a deal.

00:31:25,328 --> 00:31:26,529
No deals.

00:31:26,529 --> 00:31:27,730
We know what Chip has to offer.

00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:29,564
Oh, yeah, Kreskin, what’s that?

00:31:29,564 --> 00:31:31,132
Laura Garris.

00:31:31,132 --> 00:31:32,699
The victim.

00:31:33,966 --> 00:31:35,100
The accomplice.

00:31:42,004 --> 00:31:44,039
Hey!

00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:45,740
You got something
that can’t wait, Nick?

00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:48,041
Yeah, the ransom tape
enhanced--

00:31:48,041 --> 00:31:49,442
mega enhanced.

00:31:49,442 --> 00:31:51,176
Good. I’ll listen
to it right now.

00:31:51,176 --> 00:31:52,444
All right.

00:31:52,444 --> 00:31:54,178
Hey, I just...

00:31:54,178 --> 00:31:56,812
I didn’t know there was more
to look for, you know?

00:31:56,812 --> 00:31:57,913
You did it.

00:31:57,913 --> 00:32:01,049
It doesn’t matter
how we got here.

00:32:01,049 --> 00:32:02,450
Just remember this.

00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:05,351
( <i>horn honks</i> )

00:32:05,351 --> 00:32:06,718
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:32:23,462 --> 00:32:25,263
When you want evidence,
you can’t find it,

00:32:25,263 --> 00:32:29,265
and when you don’t want it,
it’s as big as Dallas.

00:32:29,265 --> 00:32:32,067
What you got?

00:32:32,067 --> 00:32:34,468
Can you tell
what that is?

00:32:34,468 --> 00:32:36,135
My Aunt Bertha could tell,

00:32:36,135 --> 00:32:38,003
and she’s legally blind.

00:32:39,571 --> 00:32:42,405
You want to look at my teeth?

00:32:42,405 --> 00:32:44,474
What kind of investigation
is this?

00:32:44,474 --> 00:32:46,375
A forensic investigation, sir.

00:32:46,375 --> 00:32:47,575
Fine.

00:32:47,575 --> 00:32:49,677
You look at my teeth.

00:32:53,245 --> 00:32:54,712
Give them back when you’re done.

( <i>clears throat</i> )

00:32:59,948 --> 00:33:01,416
James...

00:33:01,416 --> 00:33:02,750
We found a tooth chip

00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:03,985
embedded in the
steering wheel

00:33:03,985 --> 00:33:06,586
of your
grandfather’s car.

00:33:06,586 --> 00:33:11,522
It doesn’t appear to be, uh,
from your grandfather’s teeth.

Warrick:
James...

00:33:16,558 --> 00:33:17,893
You have a chipped tooth?

00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:23,162
Must be an incisor,
or we would have noticed.

00:33:24,563 --> 00:33:26,598
Pops, I’m sorry,
but I got to.

00:33:29,699 --> 00:33:32,367
He’s a good boy.

00:33:32,367 --> 00:33:34,035
It was an accident.

00:33:36,669 --> 00:33:38,771
I make him call...

00:33:38,771 --> 00:33:41,172
let me know where he is,

00:33:41,172 --> 00:33:44,674
especially when he’s out
after dark.

Hey, Pops, it’s me.

Tips were good.

Hey, I thought
I’d go check out

00:33:52,646 --> 00:33:54,113
a movie over at the Plex.

00:33:56,015 --> 00:33:57,315
Okay.

00:33:57,315 --> 00:34:00,017
See you later.

He drove straight home

00:34:14,925 --> 00:34:18,828
and wanted me to go
to the police station with him.

00:34:18,828 --> 00:34:21,962
I didn’t know that
little girl was dead.

00:34:21,962 --> 00:34:23,930
I swear.

00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:25,664
I didn’t know what to do.

00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:29,967
I knew Pops would know.

00:34:29,967 --> 00:34:32,368
I wouldn’t let him
turn himself in.

00:34:32,368 --> 00:34:33,869
That was my decision.

I’m very sorry, Mr. Moore.

James, I’m afraid
you’re gonna have to be

to serve his time.

We can’t let
you do that.

I made him cover it up.
That was my decision.

00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,748
He can explain all that
to court.

00:34:53,748 --> 00:34:55,148
I’ll be a witness.

00:34:57,683 --> 00:34:59,017
We both will.

run on home?

Who’s dead?

00:35:41,508 --> 00:35:43,009
No halothane in
Laura Garris’ blood,

00:35:43,009 --> 00:35:45,177
which proves she
was never knocked out.

00:35:45,177 --> 00:35:46,511
She went willingly.

00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:48,012
She and Chip
faked her kidnapping,

00:35:48,012 --> 00:35:50,780
which, of course,
makes no sense at all.

00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:53,482
Because she ended up
under ground in a box.

00:35:53,482 --> 00:35:55,583
With a black eye.

00:35:55,583 --> 00:35:57,050
Any theories?

00:35:58,851 --> 00:36:00,652
Greed.

00:36:00,652 --> 00:36:02,020
That’s ridiculous.

I didn’t even
know Chip Rundle

except that he’s
Jack’s trainer.

00:36:05,321 --> 00:36:07,423
But you became
pretty good friends, didn’t you?

00:36:07,423 --> 00:36:09,024
No.

00:36:09,024 --> 00:36:11,592
Jack...no.

Thing is, Jack,
I tend not to believe people.

00:36:16,161 --> 00:36:17,762
People lie.

00:36:17,762 --> 00:36:19,863

made a plan

too long and messy.

well thought out.

Oh, and you dropped
that halothane rag

and know you were unconscious--

00:37:02,254 --> 00:37:03,722
a real victim.

she’s anything but.

Oh, really?

00:37:08,424 --> 00:37:11,859
Then how did I end up
buried alive, scared to death?

00:37:11,859 --> 00:37:13,593
We’re getting
to that.

00:37:13,593 --> 00:37:15,128
You and Chip drove
out of town,

unbound, fully conscious.

at a roadside phone.

the ransom message

00:37:22,833 --> 00:37:27,635
and I think you were still
in the truck then, right, Laura?

Whatever. This
is your thing.

00:37:29,302 --> 00:37:30,503
Pay attention.

00:37:30,503 --> 00:37:32,004
It’s about to become yours.

00:37:32,004 --> 00:37:34,305
Grissom:
Then you both drove east
towards Sandfill Mine.

00:37:34,305 --> 00:37:36,474
He probably told you
about some little line shack

or something
where you could stay

00:37:37,774 --> 00:37:39,908
while he picked up
the ransom money.

00:37:39,908 --> 00:37:41,944
But then, all of a sudden,
he pulled over,

00:37:41,944 --> 00:37:43,978
probably made some excuse.

00:37:46,246 --> 00:37:48,480
Chip...what are we doing?

00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,949
Switching cars,
covering our tracks.

00:37:50,949 --> 00:37:54,184
I got a Jeep up
over this hill.

Where?

00:37:55,885 --> 00:37:58,886
I bet right away in your gut
you knew something was up,

00:37:58,886 --> 00:38:00,487
and then,
just a few minutes later,

00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:01,855

you were unconscious.

Dubs are queued up.

00:38:31,105 --> 00:38:33,706
Grissom:
Let’s listen
to Chip’s message, okay?

00:38:33,706 --> 00:38:34,907
Remember, Jack,
when I told you

00:38:34,907 --> 00:38:37,208
you could hear a lot
if you listened?

00:38:37,208 --> 00:38:38,842
Yeah.

00:38:38,842 --> 00:38:41,344
Chip:
<i>Bring $2 million in hundreds</i>
<i>to Charleston and Third</i>

00:38:41,344 --> 00:38:43,612
<i>in three hours</i>
<i>\or your wife dies.</i>

00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:45,513
<i>Stop me</i>
<i>from taking the money,</i>

00:38:45,513 --> 00:38:47,481
<i>she still dies.</i>

00:38:47,481 --> 00:38:50,416
I’m sure you all recognize
Chip’s voice unaltered.

00:38:50,416 --> 00:38:52,184
Now, one more time

00:38:52,184 --> 00:38:54,785
with a slight variation.

00:38:54,785 --> 00:38:56,652
Grissom:
It’s amazing what we can do

00:38:56,652 --> 00:38:58,553
with the new forensic
audio programs.

00:38:58,553 --> 00:39:00,021
Enhance sounds,
isolate them.

00:39:00,021 --> 00:39:01,422
Nick:
Heck, we can lift

00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:03,790
entire speeches
just to see what’s underneath.

00:39:06,292 --> 00:39:07,826
( <i>whooshing</i> )

00:39:07,826 --> 00:39:09,093
Grissom:
A car went by

00:39:09,093 --> 00:39:10,927
when Chip was on
the phone to you, Jack.

00:39:10,927 --> 00:39:12,829
Scared you, didn’t it, Laura?

00:39:12,829 --> 00:39:14,930
Thought it might be the police?

00:39:16,631 --> 00:39:18,832
Chip:
Bring $2 million
in hundreds to Charleston

00:39:18,832 --> 00:39:22,367
and Third in three hours
or your wife dies.

00:39:22,367 --> 00:39:24,068
( <i>muffled audio</i> )

00:39:24,068 --> 00:39:26,303
Let’s hear it once more
without that annoying car.

00:39:28,605 --> 00:39:31,172
Laura:
Chip, hurry up.

00:39:31,172 --> 00:39:32,707
( <i>gasps</i> )

00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:39,611
You’re my whole life.

00:39:39,611 --> 00:39:40,878
Please, Jack.

00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:42,746
Your work is your life.

00:39:42,746 --> 00:39:45,447
How else do you
think I started
sleeping with Chip

00:39:45,447 --> 00:39:46,781
right under your nose?

00:39:48,182 --> 00:39:49,817
All right, let’s go, Laura.

00:39:49,817 --> 00:39:51,384
Officer has a car
waiting out front.

00:39:51,384 --> 00:39:53,252
Just wait, just wait a second.

00:39:53,252 --> 00:39:54,319
Grissom, I can help you.

00:39:54,319 --> 00:39:56,220
I can get you Chip
not just on this.

00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:57,654
He was into
a lot of things--

00:39:57,654 --> 00:40:00,356
steroids--he was
into credit cards.

00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:01,757
We already have you both

00:40:01,757 --> 00:40:04,358
for about 25 years, minimum.

00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:23,336
There’s one thing
you didn’t explain in there.

00:40:23,336 --> 00:40:24,803
As soon as you dug Laura up,

00:40:24,803 --> 00:40:26,571
why didn’t
she turn Chip in?

00:40:26,571 --> 00:40:27,804
Self-preservation.

00:40:27,804 --> 00:40:30,673
She rats on him,
she rats on herself.

00:40:31,941 --> 00:40:33,275
( <i>car door shuts</i> )

00:40:40,446 --> 00:40:42,013
( <i>ignition starts</i> )

00:40:50,384 --> 00:40:52,619
So did you have
a good day at school?

00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:54,053
Yeah.
Three friends

00:40:54,053 --> 00:40:55,654
made be birthday cards.

00:40:55,654 --> 00:40:56,988
They did?

00:40:56,988 --> 00:40:59,723
Well, you have got
some great friends.

00:40:59,723 --> 00:41:02,758
So, Lindsey...
how come you didn’t want

00:41:02,758 --> 00:41:04,092
to have a party with them?

00:41:04,092 --> 00:41:06,961
I see my friends
everyday at school.

00:41:06,961 --> 00:41:09,428
I never get to be
alone with you.

00:41:09,428 --> 00:41:13,030
Oh... wow...

00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:16,666
Well, I’m really glad
to be alone with you too.

00:41:16,666 --> 00:41:18,367
I like this more than
you will ever know.

00:41:18,367 --> 00:41:19,768
Boy:
Come on, man.

00:41:21,069 --> 00:41:22,736
Girl:
I’m coming!

00:41:22,736 --> 00:41:26,605
Are you going to
get me one of those
for my birthday?

00:41:26,605 --> 00:41:30,474
Uh, maybe when
you’re older.

00:41:30,474 --> 00:41:31,675
Like, 40.

00:41:31,675 --> 00:41:32,909
Mommy!

00:41:32,909 --> 00:41:34,677
Whatee?
That’s not fair.

00:41:34,677 --> 00:41:36,378
I know it’s not fair.

00:41:36,378 --> 00:41:37,778
Life isn’t fair.

00:41:50,018 --> 00:41:52,253
Don’t worry, Pops.

00:41:52,253 --> 00:41:54,688
I’ll be okay.

00:41:54,688 --> 00:41:56,089
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:41:56,089 --> 00:41:59,257
My grandson going to jail
is never okay.

00:42:04,059 --> 00:42:06,861
You stay alive in there.

00:42:06,861 --> 00:42:08,262
You hear me?

00:42:11,097 --> 00:42:13,399
You too.

00:42:13,399 --> 00:42:16,033
Don’t be going downhill.

00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:18,034
( <i>metal door thuds</i> )

00:42:38,346 --> 00:42:40,580
Hold on.

00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:42,048
James...

00:42:43,516 --> 00:42:47,384
The first couple days
are going to be the toughest.

00:42:47,384 --> 00:42:48,819
Here.

00:42:48,819 --> 00:42:50,780
Here’s my cell number.

00:42:52,213 --> 00:42:55,220
If you run into
any problems,

00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:57,086
you call me.

00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,786
I’ll be right there.

00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:02,553
All right?

00:43:02,553 --> 00:43:05,653
Keep your head up.

00:43:23,253 --> 00:43:26,353
You didn’t have
to do that--

00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:27,686
give James your number.

00:43:29,686 --> 00:43:32,553
I’ve seen other law enforcement
people in my day...

00:43:32,553 --> 00:43:34,953
"My day."

00:43:34,953 --> 00:43:37,520
Reminds me of
my grandmother.

00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,586
Yeah, I gave her a lot
of rough nights too.

00:43:39,586 --> 00:43:42,920
She used to call me
her "work in progress."

00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:48,620
Yeah. Well...
she did something right.

00:43:51,186 --> 00:43:52,520
Maybe.
