00:00:26,959 --> 00:00:29,295
( <i>clock quietly ticking</i> )

00:00:43,917 --> 00:00:45,486
( <i>creaking</i> )

00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:06,744
( <i>gasping</i> )

00:01:17,208 --> 00:01:20,211
( <i>screaming</i> ):
NO!

00:01:30,054 --> 00:01:32,323
( <i>sirens blaring</i> )

00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:34,392
( <i>indistinct radio transmission)</i>

00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,201
Excuse me.

00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:42,402
My name's Gil Grissom.

00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:44,171
I'm with
the Las Vegas Crime Lab.

00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:45,605
Please help us.

00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:47,240
I'll certainly try.

00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,746
Is that the ransom note?

00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:56,550
Yeah. They don't even say
how much money they want.

00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,785
They just say that
they'll call us
in six hours.

00:01:58,852 --> 00:01:59,920
Have you let anyone else

00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:01,188
touch this note?

00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:03,123
Police, a relative, anyone?

00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,124
N-no, just us. Why?

00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:05,225
Well,
because the person

00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:08,361
who touched it before you
has your son...

00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:11,398
and he's just left us
the first piece of the puzzle.

Jim, Dispatch said

Divorce situation?


00:02:51,745 --> 00:02:53,280
No papers filed.College sweethearts.

00:02:53,346 --> 00:02:55,215
Neighbors say they're
the salt of the earth.

00:02:56,404 --> 00:02:57,835
So this could have been
legitimate?


00:02:57,835 --> 00:02:59,670
They have a
security system.

00:02:59,737 --> 00:03:01,172
Never put it on.

00:03:01,238 --> 00:03:02,439
They say how come?


00:03:02,506 --> 00:03:04,875
They feel safe
in the neighborhood.

00:03:04,942 --> 00:03:06,277
Check the premises?


00:03:06,343 --> 00:03:08,312
Attic, wine cellar,
crawl space.

00:03:08,379 --> 00:03:09,914
No four-month-old baby.

00:03:12,616 --> 00:03:13,717
Nice digs.

00:03:13,784 --> 00:03:15,586
Yeah, guy got rich
off some dot-com outfit.

00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:17,188
Moved here from Oregon
two years ago.

00:03:17,254 --> 00:03:19,456
Bet they wished
they hadn't today.

00:03:19,523 --> 00:03:21,692
Are you sure he won't hear
a click or something?


00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:23,027
He won't.

00:03:23,093 --> 00:03:25,296
And if he asks,
you and your wife are alone.

00:03:25,362 --> 00:03:26,797
Question him about your son.

00:03:26,864 --> 00:03:28,199
Ask to hear him breathing.

00:03:28,265 --> 00:03:29,567
Anything
to keep the guy talking.

00:03:29,633 --> 00:03:30,568
Understood?


00:03:30,634 --> 00:03:31,902
I don't know.

00:03:31,969 --> 00:03:33,070
Yeah, yeah.

00:03:33,137 --> 00:03:34,271
Okay.

00:03:34,338 --> 00:03:36,273
Built my own business.

00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,676
I can handle any
kind of pressure.

00:03:42,146 --> 00:03:43,581
GRISSOM:
Was this yours?


00:03:43,647 --> 00:03:46,917
Yeah.

00:03:46,984 --> 00:03:48,786
May I ask
when you opened it?


00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:49,954
I don't know.

00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,389
Um, sometime
after we called 9-1-1.

00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:57,595
You mind if I, uh...?


00:03:57,661 --> 00:03:59,997
No, no, go ahead.

00:04:14,612 --> 00:04:15,880
You have any more of these?


00:04:15,946 --> 00:04:17,882
In the fridge.

00:04:17,948 --> 00:04:19,884
Thanks.

00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,852
WOMAN:
<i>Do my boys have to be here?</i>


00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:23,521
I think this is
hard enough for them


00:04:23,587 --> 00:04:25,055
without having
to hear the facts.

00:04:25,122 --> 00:04:26,624
BRASS:
I understand,
but it's best


00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:29,326
for our investigation if we keep
the whole family together.

00:04:29,393 --> 00:04:31,495
It's okay, Mom.

00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:33,097
You were saying,
Mrs. Anderson?


00:04:33,164 --> 00:04:34,298
Um...

00:04:34,365 --> 00:04:37,768
I got up at 4:30,
like I usually do


00:04:37,835 --> 00:04:39,103
to feed Zack.

00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:41,038
I'm still breast-feeding.

00:04:41,105 --> 00:04:42,206
And I went down


00:04:42,273 --> 00:04:43,275
to Zacky's room.

00:04:43,275 --> 00:04:44,543
I looked in his crib

00:04:44,609 --> 00:04:45,877
and he was gone.

00:04:45,944 --> 00:04:47,045
He wasn't there.

00:04:47,112 --> 00:04:48,380
And I felt around for him


00:04:48,446 --> 00:04:50,182
and that's when
I found the letter


00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:51,516
saying that he
had been taken


00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,751
and I...I don't know.

00:04:52,818 --> 00:04:56,087
I-I think
I screamed...

00:04:56,154 --> 00:04:57,088
You screamed, Mom.

00:04:57,155 --> 00:04:58,824
I jumped
out of bed


00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:02,727
and I went to her,
and that's when we called 9-1-1


00:05:02,794 --> 00:05:04,996
from the upstairs hallway.

00:05:05,063 --> 00:05:07,732
9-1-1-1-1-1.

00:05:07,799 --> 00:05:09,367
Give me the phone,
Robbie.

00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,736
We're going to need
a piece of the baby's clothing.

00:05:11,803 --> 00:05:14,039
Something from
his hamper,
if possible.

00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,741
We're going to use scent dogs
throughout the neighborhood.

00:05:16,808 --> 00:05:19,044
I'll go see what I can find.

00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,512
No, I know what he wears.

00:05:20,579 --> 00:05:22,914
I'll go with you.

00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:27,886
GRISSOM:
I'd also like


00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:30,055
to get blood samples
from each family member.

00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:32,324
Why?
Well, the sooner
we can eliminate


00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:35,427
the expected hairs and fibers
from within the household


00:05:35,494 --> 00:05:37,395
we can begin
looking for outsiders.

00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:38,997
Is it going to hurt?


00:05:39,064 --> 00:05:42,234
I hope not.

00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:53,612
Sara?


00:05:53,678 --> 00:05:54,613
Yeah?


00:05:54,679 --> 00:05:55,814
Take this ransom
note to Q.D.

00:05:55,881 --> 00:05:56,815
Typewritten ransom note?


00:05:56,882 --> 00:05:57,983
Kidnapper was organized.

00:05:58,049 --> 00:05:59,117
I think it's ink-jet


00:05:59,184 --> 00:06:00,185
not typewriter.

00:06:00,252 --> 00:06:01,720
I'll get it
to Questioned Documents


00:06:01,786 --> 00:06:04,289
check for origination prints,
the works.

00:06:04,356 --> 00:06:05,724
Take every computer
and printer


00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:07,259
from the Anderson
house with you.

00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:09,461
You think the suspect
printed the ransom note


00:06:09,528 --> 00:06:10,595
from inside the house


00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:11,863
while they were sleeping?


00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:13,765
I'm not thinking
anything yet.

00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:15,267
Nick?


00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,601
Yo.

00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:18,603
No, thanks,
I'm an iced tea man.

00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,205
It's not a
refreshment.

00:06:20,272 --> 00:06:21,373
It's an experiment.

00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,707
Now take this
to the lab


00:06:22,774 --> 00:06:24,543
in a controlled space,
72 degrees Fahrenheit


00:06:24,609 --> 00:06:25,811
and open it.

00:06:25,877 --> 00:06:28,880
Keep this in the same
room-temp space.

00:06:28,947 --> 00:06:30,315
Okay, then what?


00:06:30,382 --> 00:06:33,385
Process, Nick, process.

00:06:35,053 --> 00:06:36,521
Baby's bedroom
window is open


00:06:36,588 --> 00:06:38,290
and the ladder's
still out there.

00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:40,959
So canvass the whole
grounds from outside to in.

00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:43,028
I'm all over it
like a cheap suit.

00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,211
You see this spiderweb?

00:07:33,278 --> 00:07:34,846
Damn, Warrick!

00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,081
I'm sorry.

00:07:36,148 --> 00:07:37,349
Your ticker okay?

00:07:39,618 --> 00:07:40,886
What spiderweb?

00:07:40,952 --> 00:07:43,455
Right here.

00:07:43,522 --> 00:07:45,790
Kind of hard to get a baby
out of a window

00:07:45,857 --> 00:07:47,392
climb onto a ladder

00:07:47,459 --> 00:07:49,394
without messing up this web,
don't you think?

00:07:49,461 --> 00:07:50,662
Well, it could
have happened

00:07:50,729 --> 00:07:51,897
after the abduction.

00:07:51,963 --> 00:07:54,132
Spiders can build
one of these things

00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:55,367
in a few hours.

00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:07,245
Warrick?

00:08:07,312 --> 00:08:08,914
What are you doing?

00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:11,383
Go around.

00:08:24,996 --> 00:08:28,366
Ooh, you're right
on the golf course.

00:08:28,433 --> 00:08:30,035
That must be nice.

00:08:30,101 --> 00:08:31,369
Steve likes it.

00:08:31,436 --> 00:08:32,871
I never cared for the game.

00:08:32,938 --> 00:08:34,940
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:08:36,608 --> 00:08:37,909
That one's my favorite

00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:40,011
but Zacky, he, uh...

00:08:40,078 --> 00:08:43,348
he liked another one.

00:08:43,415 --> 00:08:45,750
Here it is.

00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:47,853
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:51,022
There's a little spit-up on it.

00:08:51,089 --> 00:08:54,426
He liked the way
the fabric felt on his skin.

00:09:00,732 --> 00:09:03,268
Oh, God...

00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:06,171
It's okay. It used to happen
to me with my daughter

00:09:06,238 --> 00:09:08,673
if I didn't get to
her right on time.

00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:11,743
I can't believe that
this is happening to us.

00:09:13,912 --> 00:09:16,581
I'll get this to our guys.

00:09:29,294 --> 00:09:31,196
What you got?

00:09:31,263 --> 00:09:34,866
Two hair,
separate and distinctive.

00:09:34,933 --> 00:09:38,603
Ah, the plot thickens.

00:09:46,945 --> 00:09:50,382
You smell something?

00:09:50,448 --> 00:09:53,785
I smell these dirty
diapers over here.

00:09:57,122 --> 00:09:58,723
It's like a household cleanser.

00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,325
There's a pine smell.

00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:02,060
Probably used to clean
that diaper pail.

00:10:02,127 --> 00:10:04,696
No, it's stronger than that.

00:10:06,631 --> 00:10:09,301
And it's emanating
from this specific spot.

00:10:34,025 --> 00:10:35,961
Whew.

00:10:37,662 --> 00:10:40,465
Baby was killed
before it even left the house.

00:10:40,532 --> 00:10:42,501
Guy tried to cover
his tracks.

00:10:42,567 --> 00:10:45,036
SIDLE:
<i>What do you mean</i>

00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:46,371
you haven't checked for prints?

00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:47,372
It's a ransom letter.

00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:48,540
MAN:
Everything

00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:50,108
in the proper order.You know that.

00:10:50,175 --> 00:10:52,144
I got five other tests
I got to run on this paper

00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:53,411
before I try
to isolate prints.

00:10:53,478 --> 00:10:54,446
You got anything for me?

00:10:54,513 --> 00:10:56,181
Yeah. The paper's expensive.

00:10:56,248 --> 00:10:57,182
High rag count.

00:10:57,249 --> 00:10:58,650
I could have
told you that.

00:10:58,717 --> 00:11:01,186
Can you explain
these three small vertical dots?

00:11:01,253 --> 00:11:02,320
What? Where?

00:11:02,387 --> 00:11:03,655
It tells me that

00:11:03,722 --> 00:11:05,223
the printer that
emitted this letter

00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,492
has a spot on the drum.

00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:11,563
A drum goes around three
times to print one page.

00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,769
So if the Andersons'
printer was used...

00:11:19,805 --> 00:11:21,673
There'd be
three small dots

00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,708
on any paper
that comes out.

00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:26,411
No vertical dots.

00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:28,079
And different paper
than the ransom letter

00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:31,216
F.Y.I.

00:11:31,283 --> 00:11:33,218
Yeah, this mold I made
of that shoe print

00:11:33,285 --> 00:11:35,253
matches the gardener's
boot that I found

00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,721
in the shed over there.

00:11:36,788 --> 00:11:40,158
Yeah, well, we need to look
for what's <i>out</i> of place.

00:11:40,225 --> 00:11:43,695
And a gardener's boot
in a garden is not
out of place.

00:11:43,762 --> 00:11:45,997
Well, the Andersons did say
the guy's been out of town

00:11:46,064 --> 00:11:47,532
on vacation for
the last three days.

00:11:47,599 --> 00:11:48,934
( <i>cell phone rings</i> )

00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,402
Grissom.

00:11:50,469 --> 00:11:52,437
Ransom note's
not from the Anderson's printer

00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:53,438
or paper supply.

00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:54,606
You're breaking up.

00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:56,208
The Andersons are clear.

00:11:56,274 --> 00:11:59,110
Whoever wrote the letter
did it from a different location

00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:00,445
and brought it with them.

00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:02,280
Are you standing
next to the copy machine

00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:03,448
outside ballistics?

00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:05,417
You want me to check ballistics?

00:12:05,484 --> 00:12:08,186
No, I want you to move away
from that machine.

00:12:08,253 --> 00:12:12,290
Look, check all the printers
at Steve Anderson's company.

00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:13,492
( <i>dogs barking</i> )

00:12:13,558 --> 00:12:15,093
Get Q.D. to help you
with a warrant.

00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,762
Target all
immediate co-workers

00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:21,700
and disgruntled
employees first.

00:12:21,766 --> 00:12:22,701
Are those our dogs?

00:12:22,767 --> 00:12:24,736
Grissom?
Grissom!

00:12:24,803 --> 00:12:27,973
( <i>dogs barking frenetically</i> )

00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:41,953
Get those dogs back.

00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,855
Get them back!

00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:57,836
Stand back.

00:12:57,903 --> 00:12:59,070
Well, we got to
have pictures.

00:12:59,137 --> 00:13:00,438
The coroner will be
all over us.

00:13:00,505 --> 00:13:03,074
I'll get the pictures!

00:13:24,963 --> 00:13:26,364
I'm going to take him.

00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:41,012
MRS. ANDERSON:
Oh, God, my baby!

00:13:41,079 --> 00:13:43,181
Oh, my God,
my baby! No!

00:13:43,248 --> 00:13:45,584
( <i>no audio</i> )

00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:55,727
( <i>screaming</i> ):
My baby!

00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:58,730
My baby!

00:13:59,764 --> 00:14:03,335
Oh, my God!

00:14:03,401 --> 00:14:04,903
Oh, my God!

00:14:09,841 --> 00:14:12,410
( <i>wailing</i> )

00:14:16,223 --> 00:14:16,924
ANCHORWOMAN:
The Andersons, who own

00:14:16,924 --> 00:14:18,226
a profitable Internet company

00:14:18,293 --> 00:14:19,927
in Las Vegas, are said
to be devastated

00:14:19,994 --> 00:14:22,618
by the death of little Zachary.

00:14:22,618 --> 00:14:24,219
As for leads,
the police will only say

00:14:24,286 --> 00:14:26,421
they have widened
the investigation

00:14:26,488 --> 00:14:29,391
to include employees
of Steve Anderson's company.

00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:32,728
Immediate coworkers are being
asked to give DNA samples.

00:14:32,794 --> 00:14:36,098
By all accounts, the employees
are complying voluntarily.

00:14:36,165 --> 00:14:38,133
One of them is quoted as saying

00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,269
"Anything to help
Mr. and Mrs. Anderson

00:14:40,335 --> 00:14:42,871
in their time of grief."

00:14:42,938 --> 00:14:44,940
ROBBINS:
<i>I can't give you</i>

00:14:45,007 --> 00:14:47,242
exact time of death,
but I do know

00:14:47,309 --> 00:14:49,311
cause of death
was asphyxiation.

00:14:49,378 --> 00:14:51,847
He was smothered.

00:14:51,914 --> 00:14:54,183
The retinal hemorrhages
are the result

00:14:54,249 --> 00:14:56,185
of intercranial pressure
from an edema.

00:14:56,251 --> 00:15:00,389
The edema was caused by
an acute lack of oxygen.

00:15:00,455 --> 00:15:02,124
Smothered how?

00:15:02,191 --> 00:15:03,592
Did you find hand marks

00:15:03,659 --> 00:15:05,894
trauma around
the mouth or nose?

00:15:05,961 --> 00:15:08,030
No.

00:15:09,398 --> 00:15:11,333
He was in a blanket
when I found him...

00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,335
wrapped pretty tight.

00:15:13,402 --> 00:15:15,337
Positional asphyxiation?

00:15:15,404 --> 00:15:16,705
Maybe.

00:15:16,772 --> 00:15:19,041
Abductor might have tried
to protect him from the cold.

00:15:19,107 --> 00:15:21,043
Suffocated him
by mistake.

00:15:21,109 --> 00:15:23,011
I'm going
to run tests

00:15:23,078 --> 00:15:25,981
on a microscopic fiber
I found in his throat.

00:15:27,983 --> 00:15:30,152
But I don't think
his death was benign, Gil.

00:15:30,219 --> 00:15:31,687
Or accidental.

00:15:31,753 --> 00:15:33,589
Sternum was cracked.

00:15:33,655 --> 00:15:35,924
X-rays say the
fracture is fresh.

00:15:35,991 --> 00:15:38,260
Manhandled
<i>and</i> suffocated.

00:15:38,327 --> 00:15:41,463
This little guy
didn't have a chance.

00:15:47,402 --> 00:15:49,338
Are those
from Anderson's company?

00:15:49,404 --> 00:15:51,273
Yeah. There's like 200
of them in that place.

00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,809
I'm going to test them
against the ransom note,
one by one.

00:15:53,876 --> 00:15:55,911
You got Homicide's list
of disgruntled employees?

00:15:55,978 --> 00:15:57,212
They're still
working on it.

00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:58,247
You call Homicide back

00:15:58,313 --> 00:16:00,649
and tell them
to get us that list now.

00:16:01,683 --> 00:16:03,519
Hey.

00:16:03,585 --> 00:16:05,020
Hey.Where are we

00:16:05,087 --> 00:16:06,889
on those DNA samples?
I got the
hair samples

00:16:06,955 --> 00:16:08,924
from the baby's crib
ready for comparison.

00:16:08,991 --> 00:16:11,293
Yeah? So answer my question.

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,428
Well, DNA's jammed.

00:16:13,495 --> 00:16:16,465
Sanders says he'll
get to the blood
comparisons as soon as...

00:16:20,435 --> 00:16:22,938
I hear you're backlogged.

00:16:23,005 --> 00:16:26,375
20 "Unknowns" from
some drug shoot-out.

00:16:26,441 --> 00:16:28,110
FBI special request.

00:16:28,177 --> 00:16:30,445
Sheriff told me to clear it
off my counter

00:16:30,512 --> 00:16:31,580
before I do
anything else.

00:16:31,647 --> 00:16:32,748
These?

00:16:32,814 --> 00:16:35,150
Yeah. You can almost smell
Quantico, huh?

00:16:44,126 --> 00:16:45,594
There.

00:16:45,661 --> 00:16:48,397
Now they're
off your counter.

00:16:48,463 --> 00:16:52,067
Zachary Anderson,
date of birth 01-23-01.

00:16:52,134 --> 00:16:53,602
Date of death,
three hours ago.

00:16:53,669 --> 00:16:54,803
Until we find out

00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:56,839
how and why...

00:17:00,209 --> 00:17:01,777
this is the only case
you work on.

00:17:01,844 --> 00:17:02,945
Yes, sir.

00:17:04,146 --> 00:17:06,014
Never seen him
like this before.

00:17:07,015 --> 00:17:08,417
Grissom?

00:17:08,483 --> 00:17:09,818
What?

00:17:09,885 --> 00:17:14,256
You told me a few weeks ago
that nothing is personal.

00:17:14,323 --> 00:17:16,458
No victim should
be special.

00:17:16,525 --> 00:17:18,927
Everyone follows
your lead.

00:17:18,994 --> 00:17:21,063
Everyone didn't find
that baby.

00:17:21,129 --> 00:17:22,464
I did.

00:17:22,531 --> 00:17:23,665
And that little boy
is dead

00:17:23,732 --> 00:17:25,167
because someone lost
their temper

00:17:25,234 --> 00:17:26,602
or screwed up,
or God knows what.

00:17:26,668 --> 00:17:31,540
So, excuse me,
but this victim <i>is</i> special.

00:17:31,607 --> 00:17:33,308
Mr. and Mrs. Anderson
are calling.

00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:34,676
They want to know
why you refuse

00:17:34,743 --> 00:17:36,311
to release the body
for burial.

00:17:36,378 --> 00:17:38,714
They said that you gave
the coroner strict instructions.

00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,349
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:17:40,415 --> 00:17:42,217
You better drive.

00:17:42,284 --> 00:17:44,219
Sure.

00:17:46,955 --> 00:17:49,458
GRISSOM:
I'm very sorry, but we have
to preserve the evidence

00:17:49,525 --> 00:17:50,559
in a case like this.

00:17:50,626 --> 00:17:54,830
And as difficult as this sounds,
Zachary is evidence.

00:17:54,897 --> 00:17:57,299
We need to refer to him
as the case unfolds.

00:17:57,366 --> 00:17:59,334
Well, do you have
any leads?

00:17:59,401 --> 00:18:00,469
Any idea
who did this?

00:18:00,536 --> 00:18:01,904
Your child
was found

00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:04,206
500 yards from your back door,
in clean clothes

00:18:04,273 --> 00:18:08,310
wrapped in a white blanket,
laid carefully under a statuary.

00:18:08,377 --> 00:18:10,412
WILLOWS:
A stranger wouldn't

00:18:10,479 --> 00:18:11,914
treat a victim
like that.

00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:14,449
You think we had something
to do with this?

00:18:14,516 --> 00:18:15,851
GRISSOM:
The FBI tells us

00:18:15,918 --> 00:18:17,953
that you never received
a call from the abductor.

00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:21,623
What kind of a kidnapper forgets
to call the family?

00:18:23,058 --> 00:18:24,615
The wealthy family.

00:18:24,615 --> 00:18:25,682
STEVE:
My lawyer warned me

00:18:25,749 --> 00:18:27,017
that you were going
to try this.

00:18:27,084 --> 00:18:28,051
You don't have a suspect

00:18:28,118 --> 00:18:29,653
so now you're going
to come after us.

00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,754
But you have nothing to hide.

00:18:30,821 --> 00:18:32,256
You're damn right
we don't.

00:18:32,322 --> 00:18:34,091
( <i>knocking</i> )

00:18:34,158 --> 00:18:36,827
I thought I'd deliver this
in person.

00:18:36,894 --> 00:18:39,029
DNA came back
on the entire family.

00:18:46,103 --> 00:18:47,938
GRISSOM:
The blood we found

00:18:48,005 --> 00:18:50,974
in the baby's room...belongs to your son Tyler.

00:18:55,245 --> 00:18:56,814
I was playing ball
in the backyard

00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,917
and I cracked
Zacky's window.

00:18:59,983 --> 00:19:02,786
Dad had told me not to hit
the ball towards the house.

00:19:02,853 --> 00:19:04,421
So I went up
and replaced the window

00:19:04,488 --> 00:19:06,857
before anyone got home

00:19:06,924 --> 00:19:09,459
and I cut my finger
on the glass.

00:19:09,526 --> 00:19:14,064
And you wiped up the blood
with some type of pine cleanser.

00:19:14,131 --> 00:19:15,732
I thought
I got it all.

00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:18,202
GRISSOM:
Let's go back
a second, Tyler.

00:19:18,268 --> 00:19:22,105
You said that you baby-sat
for Robbie and Zack last night

00:19:22,172 --> 00:19:23,140
right?

00:19:23,207 --> 00:19:24,675
I told the police that
this morning.

00:19:24,741 --> 00:19:27,277
We had a Homeowner's
Association Vote meeting.

00:19:27,344 --> 00:19:29,913
It was just five doors
up from our house.

00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,482
I had, uh...I had made dinner

00:19:31,548 --> 00:19:33,550
and then Steve and I
walked up to the clubhouse.

00:19:33,617 --> 00:19:36,920
We were gone maybe 30 minutes,
until 9:00.

00:19:36,987 --> 00:19:38,555
We contacted the Association.

00:19:38,622 --> 00:19:39,790
The story checks out.

00:19:39,857 --> 00:19:42,059
I also did a
background search.

00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:44,261
Tyler has quite a temper on him,
don't you, Ty?

00:19:44,328 --> 00:19:45,395
What?

00:19:45,462 --> 00:19:46,430
You were expelled

00:19:46,497 --> 00:19:47,664
from school twice last year

00:19:47,731 --> 00:19:48,832
for physical altercation.

00:19:48,899 --> 00:19:51,134
That was school yard stuff.

00:19:51,201 --> 00:19:53,103
CATHERINE:
Beat up a
12-year-old

00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:54,905
in the school stairwell.

00:19:54,972 --> 00:19:56,440
He made fun of my mother.

00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,077
I wasn't going to let him
get away with that.

00:20:00,144 --> 00:20:01,645
BRASS:
Your brother Zack
say something

00:20:01,712 --> 00:20:03,814
you weren't going to let him
get away with, either?

00:20:03,881 --> 00:20:05,949
Don't talk about my brother
thatway, you bastard.

00:20:06,016 --> 00:20:08,652
STEVE:
<i>Sit down.</i> Now.

00:20:08,719 --> 00:20:10,587
GWEN:
He's, uh...he's upset.

00:20:10,654 --> 00:20:11,989
He is not usually like this.

00:20:15,225 --> 00:20:17,861
People are calling us killers.

00:20:19,897 --> 00:20:22,366
And I miss my little brother.

00:20:22,432 --> 00:20:25,402
That still doesn't mean
you didn't kill him.

00:20:37,995 --> 00:20:40,705
So what are we looking for?

00:20:40,705 --> 00:20:43,074
I don't know.

00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:45,343
Well, let's start up
and work our way down.

00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:19,270
Here's the father's
bottle of cola.

00:22:19,337 --> 00:22:20,505
Here's the Unknown.

00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:22,640
I duplicated conditions
and monitored the pressure

00:22:22,707 --> 00:22:24,142
that escaped
from the father's bottle

00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:26,678
which he'd told
you had been
open two hours

00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:29,280
against one I <i>know</i>
was open two hours.

00:22:29,347 --> 00:22:31,316
Kept this log.

00:22:31,382 --> 00:22:36,254
Pressure released
every quarter hour.

00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:39,657
Good, Nick.

00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:43,194
Did you find any ethanol
on the lip of that bottle?

00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:44,696
Well, I've got Trace
running tests

00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:46,531
now, but I did

00:22:46,598 --> 00:22:48,400
an unscientific
whiff test.

00:22:48,466 --> 00:22:50,201
Picked up a hint of
some kind of booze.

00:22:52,404 --> 00:22:54,339
Call me when you get
the results.

00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:55,874
See if they can
find out

00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,342
what this green substance is

00:22:57,409 --> 00:22:59,911
on these nylons I found
in Mr. Anderson's closet.

00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:02,580
I'll take a swatch,
get it back to you ASAP.

00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:06,751
GRISSOM:
The mother's prints...

00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:10,488
the father's prints...

00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,524
and a set of Unknowns.

00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:13,691
They're
not unknown.

00:23:13,758 --> 00:23:16,428
I ran them against
the employees

00:23:16,494 --> 00:23:18,763
of Steve Anderson's
computer company

00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,298
disgruntled and otherwise.

00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:23,535
They belong to
a Needra Fenway.

00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:26,805
And who is Needra Fenway?

00:23:26,871 --> 00:23:29,441
Steve Anderson's
secretary.

00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:33,878
So, of course,
I checked out
<i>her</i> printer.

00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:37,715
As I'm sure you know,
all printers have their own

00:23:37,782 --> 00:23:39,284
unique signature.

00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:46,357
These three...

00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:50,562
tiny vertical dots
from Needra's printer

00:23:50,628 --> 00:23:53,932
match the ransom note
perfectly.

00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:00,538
Thank you.

00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:03,641
Thank you for coming in.

00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:05,610
Anything I can do to help.

00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:07,979
You know, it's, it's just
terrible what happened.

00:24:08,046 --> 00:24:10,448
BRASS:
Maybe you can explain
why your printer

00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:13,418
was used to create the ransom
note found in the Anderson home.

00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:14,419
What?

00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:16,054
We have evidence
that this came

00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,589
from your printer.

00:24:17,655 --> 00:24:20,258
There are 500 people
who work in that office.

00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:22,293
Anyone could have used
my printer.

00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,163
We also found a strand of hair.

00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:27,165
Our lab has matched it

00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:28,433
to you.

00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,901
From the Anderson home.

00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:31,903
I'm Steven's secretary.I go there.

00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,105
Do you go upstairs?

00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:35,473
'Cause that's
where we found

00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,175
this particular hair.

00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:40,245
WILLOWS:
You two were

00:24:40,311 --> 00:24:41,413
having an affair.

00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:43,114
We ended it.

00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:44,783
Because his wife got pregnant?

00:24:44,849 --> 00:24:46,317
I'm not going down this road.

00:24:46,384 --> 00:24:47,585
What? A new baby

00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:49,120
screw up the office romance?

00:24:49,187 --> 00:24:50,989
It was more than
just an office romance, okay?

00:24:51,055 --> 00:24:52,223
Much more.

00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:55,026
WILLOWS:
Well, a lot of women
would understand

00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:58,897
if you went over there
and... got rid of that baby.

00:24:58,963 --> 00:25:00,598
Sure. Quickest way

00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:01,866
to end a guy's marriage.

00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:03,668
Okay, I need a lawyer.Is that it?

00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:05,503
Is that what you're saying here?

00:25:07,872 --> 00:25:09,874
( <i>sighing</i> )

00:25:11,342 --> 00:25:13,778
Are these your nylons?

00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:16,848
I found these hidden in the back
of Mr. Anderson's closet.

00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:18,149
So, did you come to him

00:25:18,216 --> 00:25:19,484
after you disposed of the baby

00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:20,952
and ask him to hide them
for you?

00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:23,488
Talk to Steve.

00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:29,561
Steve asked her to get out
of an obligation of a newborn?

00:25:29,627 --> 00:25:32,163
Geez, haven't these people
ever heard of divorce?

00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:38,570
Needra didn't kill Zack
any more than I did.

00:25:38,636 --> 00:25:41,306
How do you explain her hair
in the baby's crib?

00:25:47,073 --> 00:25:48,014
We broke up the day

00:25:48,014 --> 00:25:50,777
that I learned that Gwen
was pregnant with Zack.

00:25:50,777 --> 00:25:52,245
I loved Needra

00:25:52,312 --> 00:25:54,381
but I love my family more.

00:25:54,448 --> 00:25:56,950
Needra asked if she could

00:25:57,017 --> 00:25:59,219
see Zack, after he was born

00:25:59,286 --> 00:26:01,888
to help her kind of
accept the reality.

00:26:01,955 --> 00:26:04,157
So, I had her in
last Saturday

00:26:04,224 --> 00:26:06,226
to watch him sleep.

00:26:09,896 --> 00:26:11,531
Gwen had the kids
at skating.

00:26:11,598 --> 00:26:13,133
Needra was out
of the house

00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,569
in 15 minutes.

00:26:17,637 --> 00:26:18,705
You don't believe me.

00:26:18,772 --> 00:26:20,040
You've lied to me before.

00:26:20,107 --> 00:26:21,575
About what?
You told me that you

00:26:21,641 --> 00:26:22,743
opened that cola bottle

00:26:22,809 --> 00:26:24,678
the morning
you reported Zack missing.

00:26:24,745 --> 00:26:26,646
We had a test done.

00:26:26,713 --> 00:26:27,981
You opened that bottle

00:26:28,048 --> 00:26:30,050
six hours
before you said you did--

00:26:30,117 --> 00:26:33,153
the night before--
somewhere around 11:00 P.M.

00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,588
The lab is still testing it.

00:26:34,654 --> 00:26:36,857
I also believe that you
cut it with alcohol.

00:26:36,923 --> 00:26:39,259
Rum and cola--
what does that prove?

00:26:39,326 --> 00:26:41,428
Was Needra Fenway
in your house that night?

00:26:41,495 --> 00:26:43,430
Did you catch her
suffocating your son?

00:26:43,497 --> 00:26:45,465
( <i>baby crying</i> )
What are you doing?

00:26:45,532 --> 00:26:47,234
What have you done?

00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,870
That's not how it happened.

00:26:49,936 --> 00:26:52,205
Well, why don't you tell me
how it happened.

00:26:52,272 --> 00:26:53,106
( <i>glass shattering)</i>
( <i>gasp</i> )

00:26:53,173 --> 00:26:55,342
GWEN:
Robbie, what did you do?

00:26:55,409 --> 00:26:56,543
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:57,878
All right, I heard you.

00:26:57,944 --> 00:27:01,782
Do we have to have this
conversation right now?

00:27:01,848 --> 00:27:02,716
Mr. Anderson?

00:27:02,783 --> 00:27:04,184
What? Yeah.

00:27:04,251 --> 00:27:05,285
I'm from the <i>Las Vegas Post.</i>

00:27:05,352 --> 00:27:07,054
Comments about these
pictures your secretary

00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,789
sold to the <i>Midnight</i>
<i>Informer</i> this afternoon?

00:27:12,492 --> 00:27:13,593
Where did you get these?

00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:14,728
The tabloid's web site.

00:27:14,795 --> 00:27:17,764
Needra sold them to pay
for her legal fees.

00:27:22,369 --> 00:27:23,503
REPORTER:
Mr. Anderson?

00:27:28,842 --> 00:27:32,112
My only comment is
that I love my wife very much.

00:27:38,985 --> 00:27:40,053
REPORTER:
Excuse me.

00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,588
I'm from the <i>Las Vegas Post.</i>

00:27:41,655 --> 00:27:43,090
May I ask you
a few questions?

00:27:43,156 --> 00:27:44,291
GWEN:
No.

00:27:55,235 --> 00:27:56,169
A wife kills her baby

00:27:56,236 --> 00:27:58,271
to get back at her husband
over his affair.

00:27:58,338 --> 00:27:59,639
Come on.

00:27:59,706 --> 00:28:02,275
Any woman would go after
the husband, not the baby.

00:28:02,342 --> 00:28:03,910
True. But in some instances

00:28:03,977 --> 00:28:06,546
women have been known
to kill their children

00:28:06,613 --> 00:28:08,348
as a way to pay back a spouse.

00:28:08,415 --> 00:28:10,951
Particularly
if it's over an affair

00:28:11,017 --> 00:28:14,020
and particularly
if the child was a male child.

00:28:14,087 --> 00:28:16,757
Well I don't buy it.I just don't buy it, Doctor.

00:28:16,823 --> 00:28:18,325
She really loved that baby.

00:28:18,392 --> 00:28:19,326
Well, Catherine

00:28:19,393 --> 00:28:21,661
that's why
she's in this much pain now.

00:28:21,728 --> 00:28:24,131
A guy cheats,
but the wife commits murder.

00:28:24,197 --> 00:28:26,466
How come moms always end up
the bad guy

00:28:26,533 --> 00:28:28,335
with you Freud types?

00:28:28,402 --> 00:28:31,304
That's because this mother
is the bad guy.

00:28:31,371 --> 00:28:33,240
CNN just dug up
a 13-year-old charge

00:28:33,306 --> 00:28:35,642
against Gwen Anderson.I heard it on the car radio.

00:28:35,709 --> 00:28:36,943
What kind of charge?

00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:39,079
It's called shaken
baby syndrome.

00:28:39,146 --> 00:28:40,747
The oldest boy, Tyler?

00:28:40,814 --> 00:28:41,915
When he was a newborn

00:28:41,982 --> 00:28:44,851
she shook him so hard
they had to go to the hospital.

00:28:44,918 --> 00:28:46,553
She shook the kid unconscious.

00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,555
Is this authentic?

00:28:48,622 --> 00:28:50,023
Yeah, they were on the phone

00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:52,025
with the arresting officer
from Oregon.

00:28:52,092 --> 00:28:53,326
He faxed me this report.

00:28:53,393 --> 00:28:55,996

over your husband's affair?

How hard is it for you
to look at Gwen Anderson?

00:29:28,095 --> 00:29:29,262
Let me tell you something.

00:29:29,329 --> 00:29:30,697
People are presumed innocent...

00:29:30,764 --> 00:29:33,567
innocent until a court of law
can examine all the evidence

00:29:33,633 --> 00:29:34,568
and prove otherwise.

00:29:34,634 --> 00:29:36,370
Until then

00:29:36,436 --> 00:29:38,939
everything else is...

00:29:47,514 --> 00:29:48,849
Just do it.

00:29:51,284 --> 00:29:53,420
That was quite a speech
you made out there

Gwen Anderson's innocent?

You shook him unconscious.

00:30:25,986 --> 00:30:27,020
He was choking.

a legitimate question.

But I have to work on my tone.You're right.

in his windpipe.

His face was... turning red.

00:30:57,617 --> 00:31:00,854
and I started shaking him
to get the food out...

00:31:00,921 --> 00:31:02,989
to... to dislodge it,
and I did.

00:31:03,056 --> 00:31:05,826
But I realized that I had hurt
him, so I called 9-1-1.

00:31:05,892 --> 00:31:06,960
She was a new mother

00:31:07,027 --> 00:31:08,729
23 years old.

00:31:08,795 --> 00:31:10,564
If she'd meant to harm her son

00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:12,699
why would she call 9-1-1?

00:31:12,766 --> 00:31:14,000
Did the E.R. find proof

00:31:14,067 --> 00:31:16,570
that there was food lodged
in Tyler's throat?

00:31:16,636 --> 00:31:19,539
No, that's why
the police were
called in.

00:31:19,606 --> 00:31:21,074
And by the time
my client went home

00:31:21,141 --> 00:31:23,143
and found the chewed food
on the kitchen floor

00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:25,412
it was all too late.

00:31:25,479 --> 00:31:26,813
She was branded.

00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,549
It was a French fry
he had grabbed from my plate.

00:31:29,616 --> 00:31:31,518
LEWIS:
As for the death
of little Zachary

00:31:31,585 --> 00:31:33,587
my client

00:31:33,653 --> 00:31:36,256
categorically denies
any involvement.

00:31:36,323 --> 00:31:38,859
She's a victim
of an intruder
who entered her home

00:31:38,925 --> 00:31:42,396
and abducted and killed
her child.

00:31:42,462 --> 00:31:45,032
Thank you all

00:31:45,098 --> 00:31:47,134
for your continued efforts
to find the real killer.

00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,368
Did you know that your

00:31:48,435 --> 00:31:49,736
golf course paints its grass?

00:31:49,803 --> 00:31:52,205
Excuse me?

00:31:52,272 --> 00:31:54,007
It's actually a vegetable dye.

00:31:54,074 --> 00:31:55,175
Biodegradable.

00:31:55,242 --> 00:31:56,777
They've been using

00:31:56,843 --> 00:31:59,880
green dye on television
tournaments for several years.

00:31:59,946 --> 00:32:01,114
What's your point?

00:32:01,181 --> 00:32:02,749
I found a pair of nylons

00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,584
in the back of your
husband's closet.

00:32:04,651 --> 00:32:06,286
BRASS:
We, uh

00:32:06,353 --> 00:32:07,854
we have a receipt

00:32:07,921 --> 00:32:10,190
that links them to your client.

00:32:10,257 --> 00:32:12,526
GRISSOM:
The exact same dye
from the golf course

00:32:12,592 --> 00:32:16,563
where Zachary was laid to rest
is on your nylons.

00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:19,599
She belongs to the club.

00:32:19,666 --> 00:32:21,568
Grass stains.

00:32:21,635 --> 00:32:23,270
WILLOWS:
But she doesn't play golf.

00:32:23,336 --> 00:32:25,939
Remember our conversation,
Mrs. Anderson?

00:32:26,006 --> 00:32:27,307
It's not your game?

00:32:30,677 --> 00:32:34,081
If you arrest her now...you have 48 hours

00:32:34,147 --> 00:32:36,383
to charge her.

00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:39,086
You really want to show
your hand at the arraignment?

00:32:42,923 --> 00:32:45,325
We'll be in touch.

00:32:45,392 --> 00:32:46,326
Look.

00:32:46,393 --> 00:32:47,761
Mommy, I want my Mommy.Hey.

00:32:47,828 --> 00:32:50,464
Can we just go, please?
What's going on?

00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:52,332
Did you see that?

00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:54,701
A mother repelled
by her young.

00:32:54,768 --> 00:32:57,270
She didn't seem
like that type to me.

00:32:57,337 --> 00:33:00,307
All right, okay.Here, go to your brother.

00:33:00,374 --> 00:33:01,808
I'll catch you later.

00:33:01,875 --> 00:33:04,010
I want to hear
that 9-1-1 tape.

00:33:04,077 --> 00:33:05,912
Hi.Hey.

00:33:05,979 --> 00:33:06,947
Grissom?

00:33:07,013 --> 00:33:08,682
The Coroner's been
trying to reach you.

00:33:08,749 --> 00:33:10,183
Did he nail time of death?

00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:12,686
9:00 P.M., but, uh,
there's something else.

00:33:12,753 --> 00:33:15,622
He isolated the fiber found
in Zachary Anderson's throat.

00:33:15,689 --> 00:33:17,290
It's a flame-retardant
material--

00:33:17,357 --> 00:33:18,625
generic name's Metaramid.

00:33:18,692 --> 00:33:21,128
From the baby's clothes?
Fire-retardant

00:33:21,194 --> 00:33:23,063
infant's clothes are made
out of vinyon.

00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:24,564
The fiber found
in Zack's throat

00:33:24,631 --> 00:33:26,133
is a stronger
chemical treatment.

00:33:26,199 --> 00:33:27,134
It's found in things

00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,869
that are made to be
near fire and flames.

00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:32,072
Hey?

00:33:32,139 --> 00:33:35,175
Hey, can I go with you?

00:34:08,542 --> 00:34:10,377
Same color as the fiber
in Zack's throat.

00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:18,626
Okay, this is
the 9-1-1 call

00:34:18,626 --> 00:34:21,162
from the Anderson house
at 4:30 A.M.

00:34:21,229 --> 00:34:22,497
STEVE:
Our baby has been kidnapped.

00:34:22,564 --> 00:34:23,565
493 Fairmark.

00:34:23,631 --> 00:34:24,666
Please hurry.

00:34:24,733 --> 00:34:26,935
Mrs. Anderson wasn't there?

00:34:27,002 --> 00:34:28,703
You wouldn't think so

00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:31,172
but I went ahead
and separated out

00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:32,874
any underlying voices.

00:34:32,941 --> 00:34:34,175
GWEN:
What are we going to do?!

00:34:34,242 --> 00:34:36,845
She was standing, like,
two meters from the phone.

00:34:36,911 --> 00:34:38,713
Yeah, well,
it's a legitimate comment.

00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,482
Doesn't make her guilty
of anything.

00:34:40,548 --> 00:34:41,516
I know, so I checked

00:34:41,583 --> 00:34:44,019
to see if she was, like,
faking her concern.

00:34:44,085 --> 00:34:46,287
This program measures

00:34:46,354 --> 00:34:48,823
the stress level
of the speakers.

00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:51,960
GWEN:
Oh, God,
what are we going to do?!

00:34:52,027 --> 00:34:54,229
The stress is real.

00:34:54,295 --> 00:34:56,731
Are you familiar
with the JonBenet case?

00:34:56,798 --> 00:34:59,034
A little.

00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:02,170
Well, the police went back,
and they found an earlier call

00:35:02,237 --> 00:35:04,105
that was placed
from the home to 9-1-1

00:35:04,172 --> 00:35:06,841
and the audio tests
separated out the son's voice.

00:35:06,908 --> 00:35:09,778
Now, I'm not saying
that Tyler's our guy, but...

00:35:09,844 --> 00:35:11,913
we need to check
into every avenue.

00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,248
Well, I did backtrack

00:35:13,314 --> 00:35:15,684
and there were no
other calls that night

00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:17,252
from the Anderson house--

00:35:17,318 --> 00:35:19,921
from the land line,
or from the cell phone.

00:35:19,988 --> 00:35:23,358
In the parents' name,
but did you look under Tyler's?

00:35:23,425 --> 00:35:27,062
I mean, a rich kid like that's
probably got a cell phone.

00:35:27,128 --> 00:35:29,264
Yeah. All right,
I'll get into it.

00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:30,999
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

00:35:31,066 --> 00:35:32,133
Hello.

00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,235
MAN:
Anderson attorney, 7:00 A.M.

00:35:34,302 --> 00:35:35,337
7:00 A.M.?

00:35:35,403 --> 00:35:36,404
I'll be there.

00:35:36,471 --> 00:35:37,439
All the evidence.

00:35:37,505 --> 00:35:38,540
Yeah. I'll bring it all.

00:35:38,606 --> 00:35:40,542
Thanks.

00:35:53,621 --> 00:35:56,324
LEWIS:
My colleagues,
Messrs. Landry and Frank

00:35:56,391 --> 00:35:59,861
are representing Steve
and Tyler Anderson respectively.

00:35:59,928 --> 00:36:02,030
Although we're not co-counsel
in the strictest sense

00:36:02,097 --> 00:36:03,298
we've agreed

00:36:03,365 --> 00:36:06,134
the authorities should have
no more than three questions

00:36:06,201 --> 00:36:07,569
to put to our clients each.

00:36:07,635 --> 00:36:10,271
After that, we'll
accept written
submissions only.

00:36:10,338 --> 00:36:13,808
Nice... what money can buy.

00:36:13,875 --> 00:36:15,810
My family is done being
railroaded by you people

00:36:15,877 --> 00:36:17,545
so just ask your questions,
and let's go.

00:36:17,612 --> 00:36:19,414
I don't have any questions.

00:36:19,481 --> 00:36:21,816
We know what happened
in your house

00:36:21,883 --> 00:36:23,651
the night Zachary died.

00:36:23,718 --> 00:36:25,286
We've interpreted the evidence.

00:36:25,353 --> 00:36:26,955
WILLOWS:
All right, let's
work backwards

00:36:27,022 --> 00:36:28,890
starting with
the cover-up.

00:36:28,957 --> 00:36:31,826
Sometime around 11:00 P.M.the night of the kidnapping

00:36:31,893 --> 00:36:32,961
you and Mr. Anderson

00:36:33,028 --> 00:36:36,097
had a drink--
rum and cola...

00:36:40,189 --> 00:36:45,427
<i>and decided what to do</i>
<i>with the body of Zachary.</i>

00:36:47,629 --> 00:36:48,964
We have yet to determine

00:36:49,031 --> 00:36:52,167
whether or not his death
was accidental or intentional.

00:36:52,234 --> 00:36:54,536
The Question
Documents lab thinks

00:36:54,603 --> 00:36:57,473
that a parent
wrote the ransom note

00:36:57,539 --> 00:36:59,775
because there's
no money amount.

00:37:02,811 --> 00:37:04,513
Too hard to put a price
on your own son?

00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:06,982
Mrs. Anderson,
while your husband

00:37:07,049 --> 00:37:10,152
was writing the ransom note,
you wrapped

00:37:10,219 --> 00:37:11,687
Zachary's body
in a blanket

00:37:11,754 --> 00:37:14,356
that you got from the
upstairs linen closet.

00:37:18,427 --> 00:37:20,295
You then laid his body to rest

00:37:20,362 --> 00:37:22,464
near a statue
on the golf course.

00:37:26,802 --> 00:37:30,439
( <i>sobbing softly</i> )

00:37:30,506 --> 00:37:32,508
( <i>crying</i> )

00:37:33,909 --> 00:37:35,911
That's how
you got the grass stains

00:37:35,978 --> 00:37:37,379
on your nylons.

00:37:39,348 --> 00:37:41,049
You put down
a plastic bag

00:37:41,116 --> 00:37:44,753
from the pantry
so that he'd remain dry.

00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,588
Evidence of
genuine care

00:37:46,655 --> 00:37:47,689
and concern.

00:37:47,756 --> 00:37:48,857
And Mr. Anderson

00:37:48,924 --> 00:37:51,593
you put up a ladder
outside the window.

00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:54,863
The only shoe prints
we found were yours

00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:55,964
and the gardener's

00:37:56,031 --> 00:37:58,233
and the gardener
has been out of town.

00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,302
You then drove over
to your office

00:38:00,369 --> 00:38:02,371
and cranked off
a ransom note

00:38:02,438 --> 00:38:05,274
on the first
available printer

00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:08,811
<i>possibly thinking that</i>
<i>if you used a printer</i>
<i>from outside your house</i>

00:38:08,877 --> 00:38:10,546
<i>we wouldn't be able</i>
<i>to trace it.</i>

00:38:10,612 --> 00:38:11,914
But these three dots...

00:38:13,615 --> 00:38:16,585
have given you away.

00:38:16,652 --> 00:38:18,520
This <i>may</i> prove cover-up.

00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:21,523
None of it proves
they killed Zachary.

00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,425
You're right,
Counselor.

00:38:23,492 --> 00:38:26,862
Zachary's life was taken
much earlier in the evening.

00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:29,998
The coroner estimated
time of death at 9:00 P.M.

00:38:30,065 --> 00:38:31,834
LEWIS:
Estimated.

00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:34,169
It could be 8:30.

00:38:34,236 --> 00:38:36,271
Yes.

00:38:36,338 --> 00:38:40,542
While Robbie and Zachary
were in Tyler's care.

00:38:43,345 --> 00:38:44,980
You said we could ask
three questions each.

00:38:45,047 --> 00:38:48,250
Am I right?
Stop.

00:38:48,317 --> 00:38:49,318
Ty didn't do this.

00:38:49,384 --> 00:38:50,786
LEWIS:
Don't give them
anything.

00:38:50,853 --> 00:38:52,588
We're already ruined.

00:38:52,654 --> 00:38:54,356
They're just...

00:38:54,423 --> 00:38:56,759
They're just trying
to protect me.

00:38:56,825 --> 00:38:58,086
Please.
And I can't go on.

00:38:58,086 --> 00:39:00,155
Mrs. Anderson.
I killed him.

00:39:00,221 --> 00:39:01,689
I came home.

00:39:03,386 --> 00:39:07,223
Tyler h-h-hadn't put Zachary
to bed because he

00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:10,827
he was crying,
and I wanted to hush him up

00:39:10,894 --> 00:39:13,196
and, and I just, I went too far.

00:39:13,263 --> 00:39:14,564
For the record

00:39:14,631 --> 00:39:18,568
my client made this statement
against legal counsel.

00:39:18,635 --> 00:39:23,139
Would you tell us...how you killed him.

00:39:23,206 --> 00:39:27,377
I smothered him
with a pot holder.

00:39:27,444 --> 00:39:30,447
And that's when Steve and I
came up with the kidnap story.

00:39:33,717 --> 00:39:37,020
It was the longest night
of our lives.

00:39:37,087 --> 00:39:41,057
You had to wait till the morning
to report him missing.

00:39:41,124 --> 00:39:43,193
So that it wouldn't
look suspicious.

00:39:45,562 --> 00:39:48,264
And you may not believe me,
but I loved him.

00:39:48,331 --> 00:39:50,166
I loved him very, very much.

00:39:54,437 --> 00:39:57,807
We're going to have
to have them both arrested.

00:40:11,654 --> 00:40:12,922
I'm just coming
to meet you guys.

00:40:12,989 --> 00:40:14,424
I thought
you were at the Andersons.

00:40:14,491 --> 00:40:15,725
She copped.

00:40:15,792 --> 00:40:17,594
Guilty people
do that

00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:19,496
when you corner them
with evidence.

00:40:19,562 --> 00:40:21,598
Guys, the mother didn't do it.

00:40:21,664 --> 00:40:23,333
What?

00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,901
Listen.

00:40:29,639 --> 00:40:33,076
TYLER:
What did you do, Robbie?!

00:40:33,143 --> 00:40:35,078
What did you do?!

00:40:36,813 --> 00:40:39,449
I was watching the boys.

00:40:39,516 --> 00:40:42,519
I had my eye on them;
I did.

00:40:42,585 --> 00:40:45,088
( <i>baby cooing</i> )

00:40:46,956 --> 00:40:51,928
Yeah. But then you
called your girlfriend.

00:40:51,995 --> 00:40:53,897
And we got to talking.

00:40:55,932 --> 00:40:59,035
And I was kind of ignoring
Zack and Robbie.

00:41:00,704 --> 00:41:03,073
They were
being quiet.

00:41:03,139 --> 00:41:05,709
They were behaving.

00:41:05,775 --> 00:41:09,379
I turned around,
and I saw how still he was.

00:41:11,348 --> 00:41:14,984
I ran to him, and he was dead.

00:41:16,453 --> 00:41:19,789
And that's
when you called 9-1-1.

00:41:22,058 --> 00:41:24,027
( <i>beeping</i> )

00:41:24,094 --> 00:41:26,296
( <i>audio indistinct</i> )

00:41:26,363 --> 00:41:28,598
But you must have
dropped the phone

00:41:28,665 --> 00:41:31,601
to tend to Zack.

00:41:35,905 --> 00:41:38,308
TYLER:
What did you do, Robbie?!

00:41:38,375 --> 00:41:39,909
What did you do?!

00:41:39,976 --> 00:41:41,974
Then I guess somehow
in the chaos

00:41:41,974 --> 00:41:44,643
you got
disconnected.

00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:49,982
Soon after that,
your parents arrived.

00:41:51,617 --> 00:41:52,685
GWEN:
Oh, my God.

00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:55,688
What happened?

00:41:55,754 --> 00:41:59,425
One of you worked on him so hard
that you cracked his sternum.

00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,062
He was already blue.

00:42:06,265 --> 00:42:08,867
I pushed.

00:42:08,934 --> 00:42:13,038
I tried to breathe air into him,
but he was gone.

00:42:13,105 --> 00:42:15,407
We did everything
that we could.

00:42:15,474 --> 00:42:18,277
Why didn't you
just tell the truth?

00:42:18,344 --> 00:42:20,579
We wanted to protect Robbie.

00:42:25,618 --> 00:42:28,254
We didn't want him
to grow up with
the stigma of...

00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:32,191
"the boy
who killed his brother."

00:42:34,059 --> 00:42:35,394
He's three.

00:42:35,461 --> 00:42:37,863
He's clinically
unaware of his actions.

00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:40,633
No court would hold him
accountable for that.

00:42:40,699 --> 00:42:43,369
But everybody else would know.

00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:46,772
It would follow him
the rest of his life.

00:42:46,839 --> 00:42:51,243
And my wife...would rather go to prison

00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:56,048
than to have anybody know
what Robbie did.

00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:00,552
Mr. Anderson,
we won't let that happen.

00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:27,079
Now I know why you didn't
want to hold Robbie

00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:29,682
when your older son
handed him to you

00:43:29,748 --> 00:43:31,884
outside the
police department.

00:43:35,354 --> 00:43:37,756
I'm very sorry.

00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:39,925
( <i>sniffling</i> )

00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:41,894
I always, uh...

00:43:41,961 --> 00:43:45,998
I always tell them,
"Gentle, gentle."

00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:48,701
He didn't mean it.

00:43:48,767 --> 00:43:49,935
I know he didn't mean it.

00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:51,704
Of course he didn't.

00:44:04,717 --> 00:44:06,485
You must think
that we're awful people--

00:44:06,552 --> 00:44:07,953
all the stuff that's come out.

00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,256
You're an average family

00:44:10,322 --> 00:44:14,560
burdened with a tragedy
that put you under a microscope.

00:44:14,627 --> 00:44:17,162
That close,
nobody can look good.

00:44:26,639 --> 00:44:29,508
Your family's waiting for you.

00:44:29,575 --> 00:44:31,577
You ready?
