( <i>growling</i> )

00:00:28,721 --> 00:00:34,394
( <i>growling continues</i> )

00:00:35,795 --> 00:00:37,030
( <i>screaming</i> )

00:00:43,692 --> 00:00:45,127
Ah, Jeez.

00:00:47,596 --> 00:00:48,664
All right, guy?

00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:52,334
I guess he won't be eating
dinner tonight.

00:01:00,876 --> 00:01:02,511
I think Running Man

00:01:02,578 --> 00:01:05,047
was attacked up there
and then dragged or slid

00:01:05,114 --> 00:01:06,148
down here.

00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:12,388
Look at those wounds.

00:01:12,454 --> 00:01:13,889
STOKES:
He picked the wrong time

00:01:13,956 --> 00:01:15,291
of day to be running alone.

00:01:15,357 --> 00:01:17,026
Dusk is when the animals
come out.

00:01:17,092 --> 00:01:18,560
BROWN:
Yeah, from what I hear

00:01:18,627 --> 00:01:20,029
they carved out a piece

00:01:20,095 --> 00:01:21,630
of this valley
when they made the park.

00:01:21,697 --> 00:01:23,565
Some mountain lion probably
didn't like

00:01:23,632 --> 00:01:25,200
getting relocated.

00:01:25,267 --> 00:01:27,102
Mountain lions are brutal.

00:01:27,169 --> 00:01:28,804
And smart.

00:01:28,871 --> 00:01:32,508
This one evidently knows
how to use a scalpel.

00:02:18,961 --> 00:02:20,929
The carnival case.


00:02:20,996 --> 00:02:21,997
I'm taking it.


00:02:22,064 --> 00:02:22,665
The carnival case?


00:02:22,731 --> 00:02:23,666
A six-year-old girl


00:02:23,732 --> 00:02:24,833
died on a ride


00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,336
at the carnival
over on Washington.


00:02:27,403 --> 00:02:28,904
The paperwork's
on your desk.


00:02:28,971 --> 00:02:31,040
Did you straighten up
my office while
you were in there?


00:02:31,106 --> 00:02:33,208
You think
I overstepped?


00:02:33,275 --> 00:02:35,311
These people
come to town


00:02:35,377 --> 00:02:36,779
they commit crimes
and they leave.


00:02:36,845 --> 00:02:37,813
I just want
to get there


00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,081
before the carnival
moves on.


00:02:39,148 --> 00:02:42,084
Okay. Take Sara with you.


00:02:42,151 --> 00:02:45,154
She's meeting me there.


00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,056
BROWN:
<i>So, Doc</i>


00:02:47,122 --> 00:02:49,258
how big of a cat
are we actually
dealing with here?


00:02:49,325 --> 00:02:50,893
We're not.


00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,328
We're not?


00:02:52,394 --> 00:02:53,729
You ever owned
a kitten?


00:02:53,796 --> 00:02:56,098
When you play with them, they
don't just bite, they scratch.


00:02:56,165 --> 00:02:58,067
Doesn't matter whether
they're tabbies or tigers.


00:02:58,133 --> 00:03:00,703
And there's no signs
of claw wounds on the victim.


00:03:03,072 --> 00:03:04,039
So what are
we dealing with?


00:03:04,106 --> 00:03:05,040
Forget Whiskers.


00:03:05,107 --> 00:03:06,275
Think Spot.


00:03:06,342 --> 00:03:08,544
Teeth marks look canine.


00:03:10,179 --> 00:03:12,514
I was wrong
about the species.


00:03:12,581 --> 00:03:14,616
I'll make a mold


00:03:14,683 --> 00:03:15,651
of the bite.


00:03:15,718 --> 00:03:16,752
If we're lucky


00:03:16,819 --> 00:03:19,088
we can narrow it down
to breed.


00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,691
What?


00:03:22,758 --> 00:03:24,693
Most people don't admit
when they're wrong.


00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,895
I'm wrong all the time.


00:03:26,962 --> 00:03:28,864
That's how I eventually
get to right.


00:03:28,931 --> 00:03:30,599
ROBBINS:
You weren't wrong
about the scalpel.


00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:33,702
Whoever removed this guys organs
knew how to handle one.


00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:35,371
STOKES:
So a dog killed him


00:03:35,437 --> 00:03:37,106
then someone came along
and cut him up.


00:03:37,172 --> 00:03:38,407
GRISSOM:
Someone with two legs


00:03:38,474 --> 00:03:40,442
and a medical degree.


00:03:57,593 --> 00:03:59,328
Stop.


00:03:59,395 --> 00:04:00,329
What are you doing?


00:04:00,396 --> 00:04:01,563
That bag's been used 100 times.


00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:02,564
Get her a new one.


00:04:02,631 --> 00:04:04,500
They get washed every time,
right?


00:04:04,566 --> 00:04:05,901
Yeah, with disinfectant.


00:04:05,968 --> 00:04:08,103
What if it was your kid?


00:04:10,606 --> 00:04:12,107
She gets this one.


00:04:12,174 --> 00:04:14,710
Yes, ma'am.


00:04:19,248 --> 00:04:21,083
She looks scared.


00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:23,085
No six-year-old


00:04:23,152 --> 00:04:24,953
should have to go through that.


00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,956
You okay?


00:04:30,159 --> 00:04:33,162
Why don't you go find the mother
and talk to her.


00:04:33,228 --> 00:04:34,663
I'll take the crime scene.


00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:36,498
Okay.


00:04:40,903 --> 00:04:43,839
I don't know
what happened.


00:04:43,906 --> 00:04:45,474
One minute


00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:50,646
Sandy was laughing,
holding my hand,
and the next...


00:04:50,713 --> 00:04:53,749
The next, sh...


00:04:55,117 --> 00:04:57,152
Oh, my God.


00:05:03,192 --> 00:05:04,193
Mommy!


00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:08,764
Sandy!


00:05:08,831 --> 00:05:11,033
Sandy, where are you?


00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,568
I...


00:05:12,635 --> 00:05:17,940
I got out of the car...


00:05:18,007 --> 00:05:21,343
but I couldn't find her.


00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:24,813
By the time I got the operator


00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,982
to stop the ride...


00:05:27,049 --> 00:05:29,518
she was dead.


00:05:29,585 --> 00:05:32,521
MAN:
How can this happen?


00:05:32,588 --> 00:05:34,690
At a carnival.


00:05:36,592 --> 00:05:38,260
"Go back to the crime scene.


00:05:38,327 --> 00:05:39,828
Collect the dog's scat."


00:05:41,163 --> 00:05:43,732
I didn't realize how many dogs
take their walks up here


00:05:43,799 --> 00:05:44,733
when I said that.


00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,369
BROWN:
Yeah, but I bet Grissom did.


00:05:47,436 --> 00:05:49,672
This sucks.


00:05:51,006 --> 00:05:52,241
But it's evidence,
right?


00:05:52,308 --> 00:05:54,710
No, hair and fiber
is evidence, Warrick.


00:05:54,777 --> 00:05:55,778
This is combat duty.


00:05:55,844 --> 00:05:57,846
Yeah, it's somebody's doody.


00:05:57,913 --> 00:05:59,548
STOKES:
Don't even waste
your time.


00:05:59,615 --> 00:06:01,083
That's cougar.


00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:02,951
How do you figure that?


00:06:04,453 --> 00:06:06,288
See the rabbit hair
in the feces?


00:06:06,355 --> 00:06:08,123
Don't you remember
the seminar?


00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:10,592
Seminar?


00:06:10,659 --> 00:06:11,794
Julie.


00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:15,397
Julie, oh...


00:06:15,464 --> 00:06:17,633
A CSI should not be that fine.


00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,934
( <i>chuckles</i> )


00:06:22,137 --> 00:06:23,906
What is that?


00:06:27,543 --> 00:06:29,244
STOKES:
Looks like


00:06:29,311 --> 00:06:30,913
dirty ice.


00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,648
Yeah, well, I'm taking it
into evidence.


00:06:32,715 --> 00:06:35,017
It's evidence of a picnic,
Warrick.


00:06:37,853 --> 00:06:40,823
Yeah, well...


00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:41,991
we'll see.


00:06:42,057 --> 00:06:44,627
We've never had a problem
with this ride.


00:06:44,693 --> 00:06:46,762
This is the safest ride we got.


00:06:46,829 --> 00:06:49,264
Not anymore.


00:06:49,331 --> 00:06:51,100
So you didn't know
that anything was wrong


00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:53,102
until this car came out
of the tunnel, right?


00:06:53,168 --> 00:06:54,570
As soon as the Mom
started screaming


00:06:54,637 --> 00:06:55,704
I stopped the ride.


00:07:02,244 --> 00:07:03,979
Seat belt's loose.


00:07:04,046 --> 00:07:05,748
I check those every morning.


00:07:05,814 --> 00:07:07,316
Did you check this one?


00:07:07,383 --> 00:07:09,084
Yeah.
So do you strap


00:07:09,151 --> 00:07:12,021
the riders in,
or do they do it themselves?


00:07:12,087 --> 00:07:14,290
Lady, it's the Tunnel of Love,
not Colossus.


00:07:14,356 --> 00:07:17,159
People like to get up close
and personal on this ride.


00:07:17,226 --> 00:07:20,129
So you keep the belts loose
on purpose.


00:07:20,195 --> 00:07:22,331
Loose enough for adults
to get close


00:07:22,398 --> 00:07:23,499
or six-year-old kids


00:07:23,565 --> 00:07:25,200
to slide through?


00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,282
Officer, give us a minute.

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,689
You tampered
with the evidence.

00:08:53,756 --> 00:08:55,557
Ma'am, I don't know
what you're talking about.

00:08:55,624 --> 00:08:56,592
Oh, spare me

00:08:56,659 --> 00:08:57,660
the <i>Hee Haw</i> routine.

00:08:57,726 --> 00:08:59,395
You run this nightmare
on wheels.

00:08:59,461 --> 00:09:00,796
I found this in there.

00:09:00,863 --> 00:09:02,698
You send one
of your employees

00:09:02,765 --> 00:09:04,166
into that tunnel
to fix the track

00:09:04,233 --> 00:09:06,568
where that little girl
was killed to cover your ass?

00:09:06,635 --> 00:09:09,271
Glad you found that,
'cause Puppy's been missing

00:09:09,338 --> 00:09:10,673
since I rolled
into Vegas.

00:09:11,907 --> 00:09:14,610
Look, I, uh...
I'm sorry as the next jim-jim

00:09:14,677 --> 00:09:16,145
about what happened,
ma'am

00:09:16,211 --> 00:09:18,547
but... I ain't got nothing
to do with it.

00:09:18,614 --> 00:09:20,616
Field test for drugs.

00:09:20,683 --> 00:09:21,950
I'm sure you've done
this before.

00:09:22,017 --> 00:09:23,886
You can't make me
take a drug test.

00:09:23,952 --> 00:09:25,220
Oh, before you came
to Nevada

00:09:25,287 --> 00:09:26,722
you should've looked up
the law.

00:09:26,789 --> 00:09:28,057
Mandatory drug testing

00:09:28,123 --> 00:09:30,125
wherever there's been
an accident.

00:09:30,192 --> 00:09:32,795
Pee now,
and don't tell me you're shy.

00:09:42,705 --> 00:09:43,806
Stay on him.

00:09:49,878 --> 00:09:51,413
Mandatory drug testing?

00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,581
There should be.

00:09:52,648 --> 00:09:53,816
And I don't have to wait
for results

00:09:53,882 --> 00:09:55,317
to know that guy's coked
out of his brain.

00:09:55,384 --> 00:09:57,086
Cocaine bugs?

00:09:57,152 --> 00:09:58,087
Oh...

00:09:58,153 --> 00:10:01,323
Crawling all under his skin.

00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,759
GRISSOM:
Like David Crosby said,
big fella:

00:10:03,826 --> 00:10:05,794
"If I'd known I was
going to live this long

00:10:05,861 --> 00:10:07,730
I'd have taken better care
of my teeth."

00:10:07,796 --> 00:10:10,332
Right you are,
Mister Crime Scene
Investigator.

00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,635
You know, most dogs
have 42 teeth

00:10:12,701 --> 00:10:15,504
but, as you've discovered,
your Cujo

00:10:15,571 --> 00:10:17,272
only has 41.

00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:18,841
Woof-woof.

00:10:18,907 --> 00:10:20,209
Did you ever hear

00:10:20,275 --> 00:10:21,977
a dog say woof-woof,
Greg?

00:10:22,044 --> 00:10:24,313
I mean, what is
the origin of that?

00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,382
And what do we sound like
to them, I wonder?

00:10:26,448 --> 00:10:27,383
I don't know.

00:10:27,449 --> 00:10:29,985
Probably blah, blah, blah.

00:10:30,052 --> 00:10:33,789
Did you come here
with some particular
blah, blah, blah for me?

00:10:33,856 --> 00:10:34,823
Yes.

00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:37,159
Two words. Paw prints.

00:10:37,226 --> 00:10:39,895
Your dentally-challenged
killer left them

00:10:39,962 --> 00:10:40,929
all over
the vic's clothes.

00:10:40,996 --> 00:10:42,831
Greg, you know that paw prints

00:10:42,898 --> 00:10:44,867
are not the same
as fingerprints.

00:10:44,933 --> 00:10:48,737
True, and even if they were,
we don't have the database.

00:10:48,804 --> 00:10:51,307
But they can tell you
the size of the dog.

00:10:51,373 --> 00:10:52,308
And?

00:10:52,374 --> 00:10:53,475
And according
to my sagacious

00:10:53,542 --> 00:10:56,545
calculations, this is a big dog.

00:10:56,612 --> 00:10:58,480
At least 100 pounds.

00:10:58,547 --> 00:11:01,050
Now if we can just figure out
where he went to medical school

00:11:01,116 --> 00:11:02,318
we'll be home free.

00:11:02,384 --> 00:11:03,752
Huh?
The, uh

00:11:03,819 --> 00:11:09,224
big dog is
a Great Dane-Mastiff mix.

00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:12,494
So my paw prints
didn't even help.

00:11:12,561 --> 00:11:14,263
No, odontology did.

00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:15,431
Dr. Robbins' dental mold.

00:11:15,497 --> 00:11:16,832
But, uh

00:11:16,899 --> 00:11:19,101
it's always nice to have
a visit with you, Greg.

00:11:19,168 --> 00:11:20,102
Thank you.

00:11:20,169 --> 00:11:22,738
So now you think
you're going to find this dog?

00:11:22,805 --> 00:11:24,073
The array of the bite

00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:26,508
the squarish impression
of the jaw

00:11:26,575 --> 00:11:28,911
are unique to a Dane
or Dane mix.

00:11:28,978 --> 00:11:32,448
And there are only 40 registered
in the greater Las Vegas area.

00:11:32,514 --> 00:11:34,516
So if one of them
is owed a visit

00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:37,319
by the Tooth Fairy...

00:11:37,386 --> 00:11:40,522
yes... I think I can.

00:11:40,589 --> 00:11:41,724
Corn.

00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:42,791
Hamburger.

00:11:42,858 --> 00:11:43,792
Rawhide.

00:11:43,859 --> 00:11:46,762
But no human cellular tissue
in this sample.

00:11:46,829 --> 00:11:49,698
Only 30 more jars to go.

00:11:49,765 --> 00:11:50,766
This is rough, man.

00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,568
We should be pulling
better cases by now.

00:11:52,635 --> 00:11:54,103
Millionaire murders,
casino heists.

00:11:54,169 --> 00:11:56,405
It's interesting how
we categorize evidence

00:11:56,472 --> 00:11:57,940
in terms of what
it means to us

00:11:58,007 --> 00:12:00,743
as opposed to what
it might mean
to the case.

00:12:00,809 --> 00:12:03,212
Uh, we're supposed
to like scat patrol?

00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:08,217
Sometimes we deal
with bugs, worms,
waste or worse.

00:12:08,283 --> 00:12:09,752
But as scientists
we look beyond

00:12:09,818 --> 00:12:11,286
the possibly
offensive qualities

00:12:11,353 --> 00:12:13,555
of these things
to what they might
tell us

00:12:13,622 --> 00:12:15,824
about the puzzle
we're trying to solve.

00:12:17,293 --> 00:12:18,560
Yeah.

00:12:18,627 --> 00:12:20,562
Man, do you turn it on
like this at your seminars?

00:12:20,629 --> 00:12:23,299
People actually pay to go
to my seminars, Nick.

00:12:25,067 --> 00:12:26,435
We've I.D.'d the dog.

00:12:26,502 --> 00:12:27,636
Well, if he's got bits

00:12:27,703 --> 00:12:29,738
of jogger hanging out
of his mouth, cuff him.

00:12:29,805 --> 00:12:31,407
I pulled those rap sheets.

00:12:31,473 --> 00:12:32,408
Called around.

00:12:32,474 --> 00:12:33,409
And?

00:12:33,475 --> 00:12:35,477
The one with the missing tooth
is no angel.

00:12:35,544 --> 00:12:37,813
He attacked a gas man
checking a meter.

00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:41,450
Took a chunk of thigh
and severed a testicle.

00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,554
( <i>doorbell chimes</i> )

00:12:45,621 --> 00:12:47,056
( <i>dog barks</i> )

00:12:48,691 --> 00:12:50,192
Can I help you?

00:12:50,259 --> 00:12:51,527
Are you Susan Hillridge?

00:12:51,593 --> 00:12:53,329
Yes, Dr. Hillridge.

00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,435
Is this your dog

00:12:59,501 --> 00:13:00,970
Doctor?

00:13:01,036 --> 00:13:01,870
Yes, Simba.

00:13:01,937 --> 00:13:04,106
Well, you have a problem.

00:13:04,173 --> 00:13:05,975
Oh, no. Not again.

00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:14,093
What makes you think
Simba was involved?

00:13:15,373 --> 00:13:17,943
There have been complaints
about your dog in the past.

00:13:18,009 --> 00:13:19,945
Your meter reader's
singing soprano.

00:13:20,011 --> 00:13:21,079
Oh, I get it now.

00:13:21,146 --> 00:13:23,782
You're talking about
my old dog, Dickie.

00:13:23,849 --> 00:13:24,816
He was aggressive.

00:13:24,883 --> 00:13:26,051
That's why
I put him down.

00:13:26,118 --> 00:13:27,953
Simba just gets out
of the yard a lot.

00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:29,187
The dog we're
looking for

00:13:29,254 --> 00:13:31,389
is missing a tooth.

00:13:31,456 --> 00:13:36,528
I noticed that Simba is
also missing a tooth.

00:13:36,595 --> 00:13:38,029
Okay, he is missing a tooth.

00:13:38,096 --> 00:13:39,131
But he just gets out

00:13:39,197 --> 00:13:41,333
and wrestles with
neighbors' garbage cans.

00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:42,601
He's not a violent dog.

00:13:42,667 --> 00:13:44,002
That may be.

00:13:44,069 --> 00:13:46,738
We still have to take him into
custody until we can determine

00:13:46,805 --> 00:13:49,241
whether or not he had any
involvement in this homicide.

00:13:49,307 --> 00:13:51,877
Officers, go ahead.
He's all yours.

00:13:51,943 --> 00:13:54,880
You're making a mistake.

00:13:54,946 --> 00:13:57,516
GRISSOM:
You said that
you were a doctor.

00:13:57,582 --> 00:13:59,217
May I ask your specialty?

00:13:59,284 --> 00:14:00,418
Nutrition.

00:14:00,485 --> 00:14:02,487
My patients are mostly
professional athletes.

00:14:02,554 --> 00:14:06,158
Do you ever consult
with amateur athletes?

00:14:06,224 --> 00:14:07,726
Like marathoners?

00:14:07,793 --> 00:14:09,861
You mean like that jogger?
What was his name?

00:14:09,928 --> 00:14:10,929
Terry Manning.

00:14:10,996 --> 00:14:11,997
Doesn't ring a bell.

00:14:12,063 --> 00:14:13,799
And I'm very good with names,
Mr. Grissom.

00:14:13,865 --> 00:14:15,734
You'll let me know when
I can pick up Simba.

00:14:15,801 --> 00:14:17,369
You're assuming a lot.

00:14:17,435 --> 00:14:18,970
So are you.

00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:23,742
So you did the tox screen
on my carnie?

00:14:23,809 --> 00:14:25,310
Roger that.

00:14:25,377 --> 00:14:28,146
You know, I have seen
guys drink, like, five
gallons of water

00:14:28,213 --> 00:14:29,614
to try and dilute
their urine.

00:14:29,681 --> 00:14:31,016
It's the old straight flush.

00:14:31,082 --> 00:14:32,617
But all Bad Boy Sanders
has to do

00:14:32,684 --> 00:14:34,820
is just test the specific
gravity and blammo.

00:14:34,886 --> 00:14:36,588
I can still catch
their toxic butts.

00:14:36,655 --> 00:14:37,889
Mm-hmm.

00:14:37,956 --> 00:14:38,924
So?

00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:41,626
So your guy didn't do that.

00:14:41,693 --> 00:14:42,961
Great.

00:14:43,028 --> 00:14:44,396
What'd he do?
Try and mask it?

00:14:44,463 --> 00:14:45,530
No.

00:14:45,597 --> 00:14:48,099
Oh, come on, that
creep tested clean?

00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:49,234
Yeah.

00:14:49,301 --> 00:14:51,536
For someone who's on the pill.

00:14:51,603 --> 00:14:52,537
What?

00:14:52,604 --> 00:14:53,805
He's got synthetic estrogen

00:14:53,872 --> 00:14:56,074
in his urine sample.

00:14:56,141 --> 00:14:58,143
Should modulate
his mood swings.

00:14:58,210 --> 00:14:59,744
Oldest trick in the book.

00:14:59,811 --> 00:15:01,213
Somebody else's urine.

00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,682
Probably keeps a stash
in his trailer.

00:15:03,748 --> 00:15:06,718
And that Uniform was
too green to look for it.

00:15:06,785 --> 00:15:09,154
Isn't that in
the Constitution somewhere?

00:15:09,221 --> 00:15:11,823
A man's inalienable right
to pee in private?

00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:14,860
Hey, I just got off
the phone with OSHA.

00:15:14,926 --> 00:15:18,230
Our carnival has violations
in eight states.

00:15:18,296 --> 00:15:19,464
What a surprise.

00:15:19,531 --> 00:15:20,465
But that's
not all.

00:15:20,532 --> 00:15:21,600
More than half
these guys

00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:22,801
have records.

00:15:22,868 --> 00:15:24,236
And Pickens, the boss?

00:15:24,302 --> 00:15:26,004
His real name is Roger Peet.

00:15:26,071 --> 00:15:28,473
He's a convicted
sex offender on parole.

00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,175
Let's go.

00:15:32,844 --> 00:15:35,914
How was I supposed to know
she's 16 and a half?

00:15:35,981 --> 00:15:37,182
From the neck down

00:15:37,249 --> 00:15:38,784
she was all grown up.

00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:41,186
You know what I mean?

00:15:41,253 --> 00:15:43,288
I have a teenage daughter.

00:15:43,355 --> 00:15:46,158
So, no, I don't
know what you mean.

00:15:49,261 --> 00:15:50,962
Jerry Lee Lewis, man.

00:15:51,029 --> 00:15:53,298
Same thing happened to him.

00:15:53,365 --> 00:15:56,301
What's all this got to do with
the little dead girl, anyway?

00:15:56,368 --> 00:15:57,636
You tell us.

00:15:57,702 --> 00:16:01,873
I was walking down the midway

00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:04,509
<i>and I seen this woman come</i>
<i>whishing out of the tunnel</i>

00:16:04,576 --> 00:16:05,877
<i>screaming for her daughter.</i>

00:16:05,944 --> 00:16:08,046
My baby! My baby!

00:16:08,113 --> 00:16:09,381
My baby!

00:16:09,448 --> 00:16:11,817
Me and Joey,
he's the Operator

00:16:11,883 --> 00:16:13,518
we hit the kill switch,
stop the ride

00:16:13,585 --> 00:16:15,287
ran in the tunnel
and look for the kid.

00:16:15,353 --> 00:16:16,721
And I seen
her laying

00:16:16,788 --> 00:16:19,124
facedown in the pool of water.

00:16:19,191 --> 00:16:20,225
What did you do?

00:16:20,292 --> 00:16:21,626
I didn't do nothing.

00:16:21,693 --> 00:16:24,029
She was dead.

00:16:24,095 --> 00:16:25,630
I didn't come within

00:16:25,697 --> 00:16:26,698
two feet of her.

00:16:26,765 --> 00:16:28,700
I'm sorry
about what happened.

00:16:28,767 --> 00:16:32,037
But that's all that I know.

00:16:33,505 --> 00:16:35,507
If you so much
as breathed on this child

00:16:35,574 --> 00:16:36,875
the evidence will tell me.

00:16:36,942 --> 00:16:38,176
You can dope your urine

00:16:38,243 --> 00:16:39,411
change your name

00:16:39,478 --> 00:16:40,645
compare yourself

00:16:40,712 --> 00:16:41,813
to Elvis himself

00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,851
but if you harmed Sandy Dantini,
I'm going to get you.

00:16:54,392 --> 00:16:56,328
You worried you tipped
your hand in there?

00:16:56,394 --> 00:16:57,562
No.

00:16:57,629 --> 00:16:59,464
Look, don't bite
my head off,
but any chance

00:16:59,531 --> 00:17:01,733
you're going after this guy
because you're a mother?

00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,868
Pickens is a drug addict

00:17:02,934 --> 00:17:05,670
and sex offender operating
a two-ton kid magnet.

00:17:05,737 --> 00:17:08,106
Did you take a look
around that carnival?

00:17:08,173 --> 00:17:09,107
Yeah.

00:17:09,174 --> 00:17:11,143
Did you notice anything
about those other rides?

00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:12,210
Maybe.

00:17:12,277 --> 00:17:13,912
Ferris wheel--
single cars in the open.

00:17:13,979 --> 00:17:15,447
Zipper-- single cars
in the open.

00:17:15,514 --> 00:17:18,416
Himalaya-- group cars
in the open.

00:17:18,483 --> 00:17:20,585
How come Pickens was hanging
around the only ride

00:17:20,652 --> 00:17:21,987
that takes kids
into the dark?

00:17:24,022 --> 00:17:26,691
What if he pulled
that little girl
out of the car?

00:17:26,758 --> 00:17:29,728
You have anything
to support that?

00:17:31,763 --> 00:17:33,098
Hey.

00:17:33,165 --> 00:17:35,433
We aren't going
to lunch are we?

00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,270
Simba's mold's still damp,
but you can see

00:17:38,336 --> 00:17:40,138
it's a perfect match
to the bite mark

00:17:40,205 --> 00:17:41,506
on the jogger.

00:17:41,573 --> 00:17:43,942
Does this mean Simba's going
to the big dog pound in the sky?

00:17:44,009 --> 00:17:46,144
No, we need to build
some more evidence.

00:17:46,211 --> 00:17:48,046
Find some jogger
in Simba's stool.

00:17:48,113 --> 00:17:49,147
Well, I can
tell you

00:17:49,214 --> 00:17:51,683
we found a unique sample
at the crime scene.

00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,618
Great Dane-sized scat containing

00:17:53,685 --> 00:17:55,754
bits of premium
pet store kibble.

00:17:55,821 --> 00:17:57,222
How premium?

00:17:57,289 --> 00:17:59,458
Sirloin, rice, nothing
artificial.

00:17:59,524 --> 00:18:02,461
We need to find out what
Dr. Hillridge feeds her dog.

00:18:03,728 --> 00:18:05,096
Just coming to see you.

00:18:05,163 --> 00:18:08,166
You remember that ice we found
at the crime scene?

00:18:08,233 --> 00:18:10,235
There's nothing in here.

00:18:10,302 --> 00:18:11,770
It didn't melt.
It evaporated.

00:18:11,837 --> 00:18:12,938
Dry ice.

00:18:13,004 --> 00:18:14,539
Frozen CO2 sublimates

00:18:14,606 --> 00:18:16,408
into invisible gas, not water.

00:18:16,475 --> 00:18:19,010
The jogger was missing
some organs.

00:18:19,077 --> 00:18:21,413
Surgical teams use dry ice
to pack organs

00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,814
shipped for transplant.

00:18:22,881 --> 00:18:25,250
It just so happens the dog's
owner is a doctor.

00:18:25,317 --> 00:18:26,251
Surgeon?

00:18:26,318 --> 00:18:27,519
Nutritionist.

00:18:27,586 --> 00:18:30,489
But all medical residents
have surgical rotations.

00:18:30,555 --> 00:18:32,524
Fellas, we have
a doctor's appointment.

00:19:35,987 --> 00:19:37,322
Would you mind

00:19:37,389 --> 00:19:39,391
if I looked in your freezer?

00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:41,493
I have a patient coming
in exactly 20 minutes

00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,728
so if you want to rifle
around until then, fine

00:19:43,795 --> 00:19:45,664
but I will not leave
my place of business.

00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:46,765
No one's asked you to.

00:20:09,821 --> 00:20:12,224
You're very organized,
Dr. Hillridge.

00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:14,392
I imagine
you're upset

00:20:14,459 --> 00:20:16,761
about your dog--
having to put him down.

00:20:16,828 --> 00:20:18,797
I don't hold onto things.

00:20:18,864 --> 00:20:21,433
I accept the evolution
of change.

00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,636
We live, we die,
we replenish the earth.

00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:26,505
Man's best friend...

00:20:26,571 --> 00:20:28,306
but not yours, huh?

00:20:28,373 --> 00:20:30,242
None of us gets out alive.

00:20:30,308 --> 00:20:33,345
I would think in your job
you'd know that.

00:20:33,411 --> 00:20:35,781
But if we treat our
bodies like a temple

00:20:35,847 --> 00:20:39,351
we can cheat time.

00:20:39,417 --> 00:20:41,286
Your eyes...

00:20:41,353 --> 00:20:43,255
What?

00:20:43,321 --> 00:20:44,456
The lower rims are pale.

00:20:44,523 --> 00:20:46,024
You're deficient in folic acid.

00:20:46,091 --> 00:20:48,126
You're not eating
your beets.

00:20:48,193 --> 00:20:50,662
Two beets have 541/////2%
percent of the RDA.

00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:04,342
May I ask you what medical
school you attended?

00:21:04,409 --> 00:21:06,945
Will that help
with your investigation?

00:21:07,012 --> 00:21:08,980
I just thought the way you
handled that knife...

00:21:09,047 --> 00:21:10,282
Oh, the knife. No.

00:21:10,348 --> 00:21:11,616
I was in the CIA.

00:21:12,918 --> 00:21:16,221
Culinary Institute of America.

00:21:16,288 --> 00:21:20,058
( <i>blender whirring</i> )

00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:22,294
Tell me, Mr. Grissom

00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:27,332
how does a man choose death
as his profession?

00:21:27,399 --> 00:21:29,668
It chose me, actually.

00:21:29,734 --> 00:21:32,270
I guess one man's corpse
is another man's candy.

00:21:32,337 --> 00:21:33,271
Care for a sip?

00:21:33,338 --> 00:21:34,506
It's full of folacin.

00:21:34,573 --> 00:21:36,007
No, thanks.

00:21:37,909 --> 00:21:40,278
Griss, can I show you something?

00:21:42,013 --> 00:21:43,849
Excuse me.

00:21:48,687 --> 00:21:51,423
Surgery equipment.

00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:57,262
"Emory Medical Supplies,
Boston, Mass, 1875."

00:21:57,329 --> 00:22:00,031
Antiques.

00:22:01,433 --> 00:22:03,568
Boy, these are
well maintained.

00:22:03,635 --> 00:22:05,270
Exactly.

00:22:05,337 --> 00:22:06,638
What I find interesting

00:22:06,705 --> 00:22:09,941
is that she keeps them near
the door, not in the office.

00:22:10,008 --> 00:22:12,944
In case she needs to break out
and go do some work.

00:22:13,011 --> 00:22:16,481
Maybe she makes house calls.

00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:19,851
May we help you?

00:22:19,918 --> 00:22:21,319
Yes, is Dr. Hillridge around?

00:22:21,386 --> 00:22:22,420
I'm here for a 4:00.

00:22:25,991 --> 00:22:26,925
Edwin.

00:22:26,992 --> 00:22:28,126
You look great today.

00:22:28,193 --> 00:22:29,161
How'd the race go?

00:22:29,227 --> 00:22:31,563
I finished in three hours
and ten minutes.

00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:33,165
You can do better.

00:22:44,376 --> 00:22:45,911
She gives me the willies.

00:22:45,977 --> 00:22:47,712
We can't arrest
her for that.

00:22:47,779 --> 00:22:50,715
Yeah, well, maybe
we can link these
to the crime.

00:22:50,782 --> 00:22:52,551
Her dog may have eaten
that jogger

00:22:52,617 --> 00:22:54,319
but he can't harvest
the organs.

00:22:54,386 --> 00:22:58,290
No question about it, the cause
of death is drowning.

00:22:58,356 --> 00:22:59,958
How tall
was the victim?

00:23:00,025 --> 00:23:02,427
Three feet, give or
take an inch.

00:23:02,494 --> 00:23:03,562
The water was

00:23:03,628 --> 00:23:05,096
a foot and a half deep.

00:23:05,163 --> 00:23:09,134
She could've easily climbed out,
unless she was unconscious.

00:23:09,201 --> 00:23:11,470
Maybe she had a minor
concussion, or was stunned.

00:23:11,536 --> 00:23:13,638
That could explain why she
couldn't get out.

00:23:13,705 --> 00:23:15,674
I checked, believe me.
She didn't.

00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:18,510
The only injury
I could find on
this little girl

00:23:18,577 --> 00:23:19,945
was a fractured
forearm.

00:23:20,011 --> 00:23:21,413
Spiral or straight?

00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,881
X-rays just came back.

00:23:22,948 --> 00:23:23,982
Let's see.

00:23:32,023 --> 00:23:33,291
Spiral.

00:23:33,358 --> 00:23:35,360
That's not from a fall.

00:23:35,427 --> 00:23:37,662
Somebody twisted
that little girl's arm

00:23:37,729 --> 00:23:39,231
hard enough to break it.

00:23:40,465 --> 00:23:41,933
Perimortem?

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,934
Swelling takes

00:23:43,001 --> 00:23:44,536
at least two to four minutes

00:23:44,603 --> 00:23:45,804
of active circulation.

00:23:45,871 --> 00:23:47,806
There's no swelling,
so it had to happen

00:23:47,873 --> 00:23:49,708
moments before she died.

00:23:49,774 --> 00:23:52,677
So someone did yank her out
of that car in the dark.

00:23:52,744 --> 00:23:54,813
Mommy!

00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,349
Sandy!

00:23:57,415 --> 00:23:59,384
Wait.

00:23:59,451 --> 00:24:02,187
Pickens yanks her out
just so he can drown her?

00:24:02,254 --> 00:24:03,288
He's a sex offender.

00:24:03,355 --> 00:24:05,056
He was going
to take her someplace.

00:24:05,123 --> 00:24:06,892
Not without someone seeing him.

00:24:06,958 --> 00:24:08,126
You read the OSHA report.

00:24:08,193 --> 00:24:10,162
How many emergency doors
were operational?

00:24:10,228 --> 00:24:12,130
None.

00:24:12,197 --> 00:24:16,401
He was trapped like a rat.

00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:21,907
He did the only thing he could--

00:24:21,973 --> 00:24:23,809
he hid the evidence.

00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:27,212
Drowned the little girl.

00:24:29,247 --> 00:24:31,316
I'm going to go call Brass.

00:24:32,317 --> 00:24:33,752
You're going
to enter this

00:24:33,819 --> 00:24:35,387
as a homicide, right?

00:24:35,454 --> 00:24:36,755
Technically, it's

00:24:36,822 --> 00:24:39,391
somewhere between
accidental and undetermined.

00:24:39,458 --> 00:24:40,392
It's a homicide.

00:24:40,459 --> 00:24:41,827
I'm going to get your proof.

00:24:41,893 --> 00:24:43,962
So write down that accidental
in pencil.

00:24:54,072 --> 00:24:55,774
Can you help me?

00:24:55,841 --> 00:24:58,944
I need to find out when my
daughter's going to be released.

00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:00,879
I'm not a coroner.
What's your daughter's name?

00:25:00,946 --> 00:25:02,347
Sandy Dantini.

00:25:02,414 --> 00:25:05,550
Oh, Mrs. Dantini.

00:25:05,617 --> 00:25:07,886
I'm Catherine Willows
from the Crime Lab.

00:25:07,953 --> 00:25:08,920
You've spoken with

00:25:08,987 --> 00:25:10,522
my colleague,
Sara Sidle.

00:25:10,589 --> 00:25:12,390
I'm so sorry.

00:25:14,426 --> 00:25:17,596
Um... did you find out what
happened at the carnival

00:25:17,662 --> 00:25:19,264
to my baby?

00:25:19,331 --> 00:25:22,100
Actually, I'd like to ask
you a few questions.

00:25:22,167 --> 00:25:24,870
Is it possible

00:25:24,936 --> 00:25:27,572
that someone reached
into your car

00:25:27,639 --> 00:25:29,975
and pulled out your daughter?

00:25:30,041 --> 00:25:34,079
I... thought it was an accident.

00:25:34,146 --> 00:25:35,380
You read all the time

00:25:35,447 --> 00:25:38,049
about how dangerous
amusement parks can be.

00:25:38,116 --> 00:25:40,552
You think it can never
happen to you.

00:25:40,619 --> 00:25:44,422
You think you can
protect your kids.

00:25:46,191 --> 00:25:50,328
Well, when you went in
the water to try to save Sandy

00:25:50,395 --> 00:25:52,130
did you hear anything?

00:25:52,197 --> 00:25:56,501
Did you... sense that anyone
was there... in the dark?

00:25:59,805 --> 00:26:00,872
I-I-I don't know.

00:26:00,939 --> 00:26:04,042
I mean, well, you know,
it all happened so fast.

00:26:04,109 --> 00:26:06,311
I was... focused on
finding Sandy.

00:26:08,246 --> 00:26:09,347
Do you...

00:26:09,414 --> 00:26:12,551
do you think someone else
was there?

00:26:14,619 --> 00:26:18,290
I'm not ruling anything out.

00:26:32,269 --> 00:26:33,528
Look, I didn't do
anything wrong.

00:26:33,528 --> 00:26:34,863
I may have recycled
a few caskets

00:26:34,929 --> 00:26:35,864
but you're
talking about

00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:37,332
a whole different
ball game, here.

00:26:37,399 --> 00:26:39,834
Mr. Gesek, I'm not
accusing you of anything.

00:26:39,901 --> 00:26:41,503
I'm not even
here officially.

00:26:41,569 --> 00:26:43,038
Think of yourself
as a consultant

00:26:43,104 --> 00:26:44,339
to the Las Vegas Crime Lab.

00:26:44,406 --> 00:26:46,107
Do I get paid?

00:26:48,076 --> 00:26:50,078
What do you know
about organ theft?

00:26:50,145 --> 00:26:51,513
Oh, if I was
in that business

00:26:51,579 --> 00:26:53,348
I wouldn't worry
about getting paid.

00:26:53,415 --> 00:26:55,250
You know there are
places overseas

00:26:55,316 --> 00:26:57,952
that'll pay 50 grand
for one lung?

00:26:58,019 --> 00:26:59,254
60 for a heart?

00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,222
And you know
this because...?

00:27:01,289 --> 00:27:02,390
Not firsthand.

00:27:02,457 --> 00:27:03,691
Not even secondhand.

00:27:03,758 --> 00:27:06,194
At the last funeral
directors' convention...

00:27:06,261 --> 00:27:07,896
you'd be amazed
what you hear.

00:27:07,962 --> 00:27:09,731
But, you know,
it takes a lot

00:27:09,798 --> 00:27:11,399
to keep a
business afloat.

00:27:11,466 --> 00:27:14,969
Tell me about
the local market for organs.

00:27:15,036 --> 00:27:17,272
Well, we're talking about
life and death.

00:27:17,338 --> 00:27:18,773
It's probably pretty good.

00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,543
If someone was disemboweled
and their liver taken

00:27:21,609 --> 00:27:23,078
what would that go for?

00:27:23,144 --> 00:27:24,979
Menu, everything a la carte.

00:27:25,046 --> 00:27:26,247
Corneas, $5,000.

00:27:26,314 --> 00:27:27,515
Kidney, $20,000.

00:27:27,582 --> 00:27:28,583
Liver, 40.

00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:29,584
Bowel, 30.

00:27:29,651 --> 00:27:30,985
Pancreas, 18.

00:27:33,021 --> 00:27:36,124
It's amazing what you can learn
at a convention.

00:27:37,192 --> 00:27:38,159
Warrick.

00:27:38,226 --> 00:27:39,461
I got a match.

00:27:39,527 --> 00:27:40,729
Cool.
Yeah.

00:27:40,795 --> 00:27:41,796
You want to
hand me those

00:27:41,863 --> 00:27:42,897
filter papers
right there?

00:27:42,964 --> 00:27:44,632
The scat I found
at the crime scene

00:27:44,699 --> 00:27:46,167
and the scat from
the doctor's house

00:27:46,234 --> 00:27:47,902
were the same,
except for one difference.

00:27:47,969 --> 00:27:49,337
The stuff from the backyard--

00:27:49,404 --> 00:27:51,606
full of human
cellular tissue.

00:27:51,673 --> 00:27:53,108
Jogger DNA.

00:27:53,174 --> 00:27:54,476
So we got the right dog.

00:27:56,711 --> 00:28:00,048
Well, let's see
if the owner cut the vic up.

00:28:01,383 --> 00:28:02,951
Reactive agents.

00:28:03,017 --> 00:28:05,186
One part
leuko-malachite.

00:28:05,253 --> 00:28:06,721
One part
hydrogen peroxide--

00:28:06,788 --> 00:28:08,390
used by blondes
everywhere.

00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:16,498
Blue.

00:28:16,564 --> 00:28:17,766
Weird, isn't it?

00:28:17,832 --> 00:28:18,833
What's that?

00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,968
To prove
the presence of heme

00:28:20,035 --> 00:28:21,269
the stuff
that makes blood red...

00:28:21,336 --> 00:28:22,871
Turns the swab blue.

00:28:22,937 --> 00:28:24,472
Yeah.

00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:25,640
I own this attraction

00:28:25,707 --> 00:28:27,876
and it's going with me
to the next town.

00:28:27,942 --> 00:28:29,044
It's evidence.

00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:30,945
It's not going anywhere.
Nothing is.

00:28:31,012 --> 00:28:32,847
What, says you
two string beans?

00:28:32,914 --> 00:28:34,315
It's going
to take a
lot more than

00:28:34,382 --> 00:28:36,017
vegetable insults
to get us to move.

00:28:36,084 --> 00:28:37,886
Lady, you don't know
who you're messing with.

00:28:37,952 --> 00:28:41,122
Oh, I know exactly
who you are, Mr. Pickens.

00:28:41,189 --> 00:28:42,824
And if you so much
as look at me

00:28:42,891 --> 00:28:44,759
in the wrong way,
I will personally
lock you in a cell

00:28:44,826 --> 00:28:46,694
with someone who's going
to do the same thing to you

00:28:46,761 --> 00:28:48,363
that you've been doing
to those little girls.

00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:49,464
BRASS:
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:28:49,531 --> 00:28:51,866
What, you start
the party without me?

00:28:51,933 --> 00:28:53,601
That could get dangerous.

00:28:55,537 --> 00:28:56,905
Thomas Pickens?

00:28:56,971 --> 00:28:57,939
Yeah.

00:28:58,006 --> 00:28:58,973
I got a court order.

00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,308
This ride stays in Vegas

00:29:00,375 --> 00:29:01,810
and you're coming with me.

00:29:01,876 --> 00:29:03,411
You pullin' my pud?

00:29:03,478 --> 00:29:05,447
You know, the thought
never crossed my mind.

00:29:05,513 --> 00:29:06,748
Come on.

00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,987
What?

00:29:13,054 --> 00:29:15,757
Nothing.

00:29:15,824 --> 00:29:17,258
This is fun.

00:29:17,325 --> 00:29:18,993
As compared to what?

00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:21,129
As compared to a more
scientific approach.

00:29:23,298 --> 00:29:24,232
I'm sorry, guys.

00:29:24,299 --> 00:29:25,366
If she cut up that jogger

00:29:25,433 --> 00:29:26,668
she didn't use that scalpel.

00:29:26,735 --> 00:29:29,003
But we found evidence
of blood on it.

00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:30,939
I had Sanders
run a degradation

00:29:31,005 --> 00:29:32,440
on that same sample.

00:29:32,507 --> 00:29:34,843
The blood is
50 to 200 years old.

00:29:34,909 --> 00:29:36,277
Antique, like
the scalpel

00:29:36,344 --> 00:29:37,779
ruling out
the possibility

00:29:37,846 --> 00:29:39,581
it was used
in the murder of our jogger.

00:29:39,647 --> 00:29:41,616
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

00:29:41,683 --> 00:29:42,951
Yeah.

00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:45,754
I'll be
right out.

00:29:48,256 --> 00:29:49,924
I have a visitor.

00:30:00,535 --> 00:30:01,569
Hi.

00:30:01,636 --> 00:30:02,670
I have folic acid.

00:30:02,737 --> 00:30:04,572
I was worried
about your eyes.

00:30:04,639 --> 00:30:07,042
I assume my
surgical instruments

00:30:07,108 --> 00:30:09,978
came back clean,
or relatively clean.

00:30:10,045 --> 00:30:12,981
Are you here for
a nutritional
consultation

00:30:13,048 --> 00:30:15,550
or to eavesdrop
on my investigation?

00:30:15,617 --> 00:30:18,353
Actually, my house
felt a little crowded--

00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,021
all those men you sent.

00:30:22,457 --> 00:30:25,093
The, uh, police sent them.

00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,795
But you dictated the
scope of the warrant.

00:30:26,861 --> 00:30:28,997
They're taking everything
from my kitchen and office.

00:30:29,064 --> 00:30:32,300
You have three prior complaints
in three separate states

00:30:32,367 --> 00:30:33,768
for owning vicious dogs.

00:30:33,835 --> 00:30:35,370
And?

00:30:35,437 --> 00:30:37,072
What else do you
know about me?

00:30:37,138 --> 00:30:40,308
Each complaint is
from a mountain state.

00:30:40,375 --> 00:30:42,243
Is it a crime to
like the mountains?

00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:43,411
No.

00:30:43,478 --> 00:30:47,115
Only if we find other joggers
have turned up dead.

00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:51,252
What's a liver go for
these days, Doc?

00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:53,321
What?

00:30:53,388 --> 00:30:56,524
Terry Manning was missing
several key organs--

00:30:56,591 --> 00:30:57,625
healthy organs.

00:30:57,692 --> 00:30:58,860
You disappoint me.

00:30:58,927 --> 00:31:01,362
I thought you were
smarter than that.

00:31:01,429 --> 00:31:05,400
Coenzyme Q-10 could
help with mental acuity.

00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:12,173
"The last act is bloody

00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,809
however fine
the rest of the play."

00:31:14,876 --> 00:31:16,911
Pascal.

00:31:16,978 --> 00:31:19,814
Very impressive.

00:31:19,881 --> 00:31:22,317
I prefer Buddha,
though.

00:31:22,384 --> 00:31:26,321
"Even death is not to be feared
by those who lived wisely."

00:31:26,388 --> 00:31:28,523
One request.

00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:30,625
Ask them not to leave
my house a mess.

00:31:30,692 --> 00:31:32,494
You know how I like order.

00:31:50,578 --> 00:31:52,414
What, are you guys
working in bulk now?

00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,515
Hey, you're the one who said

00:31:53,581 --> 00:31:54,883
that lady doc keeps
skipping town.

00:31:54,949 --> 00:31:56,084
If the jogger's blood

00:31:56,151 --> 00:31:58,586
is in any of this stuff,
we need to find it now.

00:31:58,653 --> 00:32:00,855
This is only part of
the kitchen-- the rest is

00:32:00,922 --> 00:32:02,023
in those bags and boxes.

00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:03,058
I'm ready, Nick.

00:32:03,124 --> 00:32:04,359
You want to
hit the lights?

00:32:32,921 --> 00:32:34,189
She made a protein shake

00:32:34,255 --> 00:32:36,024
in this yesterday

00:32:36,091 --> 00:32:38,093
right in front of me.

00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:41,296
Why would she do that?

00:32:41,362 --> 00:32:43,031
Get this to DNA--

00:32:43,098 --> 00:32:45,767
see if this is
the jogger's blood.

00:32:45,834 --> 00:32:48,269
I'd place a bet on it.

00:32:51,106 --> 00:32:52,874
Whoa, whoa.

00:32:52,941 --> 00:32:54,442
So she's not
selling the organs

00:32:54,509 --> 00:32:57,512
on the black market...
she's eating them?

00:32:59,547 --> 00:33:01,516
Possibly drinking them.

00:33:18,122 --> 00:33:20,358
I want four techs in there
placed four feet apart.

00:33:20,424 --> 00:33:21,759
Let's try to pull
the girl out

00:33:21,826 --> 00:33:23,094
from every
conceivable angle.

00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,895
Okay, based on our theory

00:33:24,962 --> 00:33:27,264
a loose seat belt
enabled Pickens

00:33:27,331 --> 00:33:30,201
to yank the little girl
out of her seat.

00:33:33,137 --> 00:33:35,406
Mom was on the left.

00:33:37,174 --> 00:33:39,777
42 pounds?

00:33:41,012 --> 00:33:43,280
Just like
little Sandy.

00:33:44,749 --> 00:33:46,851
And, just like...

00:33:46,917 --> 00:33:50,154
the loose seat belt.

00:34:28,059 --> 00:34:31,329
The belt wasn't loose enough
to yank the girl out.

00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:35,599
Forget Pickens.

00:34:35,666 --> 00:34:37,501
The only person who
could've done it, then

00:34:37,568 --> 00:34:40,104
is the person that was in
the car with her-- the mother.

00:34:40,171 --> 00:34:43,474
Her eyes were pointing
in the wrong direction.

00:34:43,541 --> 00:34:45,943
I'm sorry, what?

00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:48,746
Carla Dantini was looking left

00:34:48,813 --> 00:34:50,448
when she told me
about the accident.

00:34:53,351 --> 00:34:56,721
When a person is remembering,
they look right

00:34:56,787 --> 00:34:59,090
and when they're creating,
they look left.

00:34:59,156 --> 00:35:02,493
And by creating,
you mean fabricating.

00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,462
Neurolinguistics
programming

00:35:04,528 --> 00:35:06,964
human behavioral science.

00:35:07,031 --> 00:35:08,265
Call Brass and tell him

00:35:08,332 --> 00:35:10,701
to meet us
at the mother's house.

00:35:20,011 --> 00:35:21,846
Mr. Grissom.

00:35:21,912 --> 00:35:24,181
You're looking grim.

00:35:24,248 --> 00:35:26,817
I'm afraid I don't have
a supplement for that.

00:35:26,884 --> 00:35:30,254
We found blood in
your kitchen blender.

00:35:30,321 --> 00:35:33,090
The lab has matched it
to the dead jogger.

00:35:34,592 --> 00:35:37,128
It had to happen eventually.

00:35:37,194 --> 00:35:38,162
Why?

00:35:38,229 --> 00:35:39,297
You're the scientist.

00:35:39,363 --> 00:35:42,033
I should have thought
you'd figured that out.

00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:45,336
I haven't.

00:35:45,403 --> 00:35:47,838
Think of the bugs, Grissom.

00:35:47,905 --> 00:35:49,173
Cycle of life?

00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,242
Angels versus insects?

00:35:51,309 --> 00:35:53,010
When we die

00:35:53,077 --> 00:35:55,046
the fable we tell ourselves

00:35:55,112 --> 00:35:58,182
is we go toward
a white light and angels.

00:35:58,249 --> 00:36:00,785
But you and I both know
the hard reality

00:36:00,851 --> 00:36:02,953
is that insects
arrive immediately

00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:05,189
and begin turning us
back to earth.

00:36:05,256 --> 00:36:07,158
Yes.

00:36:07,224 --> 00:36:09,527
But the insects
haven't killed anyone.

00:36:09,593 --> 00:36:11,095
No.

00:36:11,162 --> 00:36:15,366
But they'd die if they didn't
have bodies to feed off of.

00:36:15,433 --> 00:36:16,968
And so will I.

00:36:18,669 --> 00:36:20,771
Porphyria.

00:36:20,838 --> 00:36:24,275
The madness of King George.

00:36:24,342 --> 00:36:26,777
Or the legend of the vampire.

00:36:26,844 --> 00:36:29,814
Which makes it
a real hard disease to have.

00:36:31,248 --> 00:36:32,717
But it's real for me.

00:36:32,783 --> 00:36:34,185
It's genetic.

00:36:34,251 --> 00:36:37,254
The only thing
my father ever gave me.

00:36:40,424 --> 00:36:45,563
The first time it presented
was after a minor sunburn.

00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:48,599
My lips receded,
so did my gums.

00:36:48,666 --> 00:36:51,936
I increased my glucose intake
and I was fine...

00:36:52,003 --> 00:36:53,471
for a while.

00:36:53,537 --> 00:36:56,474
I began
a drug regimen.

00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:58,509
But they only treated
the symptoms.

00:36:58,576 --> 00:37:01,946
I had my spleen removed
because it absorbed my blood.

00:37:02,013 --> 00:37:04,448
But nothing helped.

00:37:04,515 --> 00:37:07,785
Lesions started forming
on my face.

00:37:07,852 --> 00:37:10,521
That's when I bought
my first dog.

00:37:10,588 --> 00:37:13,557
Bullets and poison
leave residue in the blood.

00:37:13,624 --> 00:37:16,160
Dogs kill clean.

00:37:16,227 --> 00:37:19,330
Imagine what I'd look like
by now without them.

00:37:27,204 --> 00:37:30,474
You could've tried
intravenous hematin.

00:37:30,541 --> 00:37:33,511
Human blood is
the richest source of heme.

00:37:33,577 --> 00:37:34,679
And so you extracted

00:37:34,745 --> 00:37:36,447
the organs with
the most blood--

00:37:36,514 --> 00:37:38,316
the liver,
the spleen,
the heart.

00:37:38,382 --> 00:37:42,353
If you lock me up, I'll go mad.

00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:45,423
Unfortunately,
a symptom of your condition.

00:37:45,489 --> 00:37:47,458
But you've been
killing people, Doctor.

00:37:47,525 --> 00:37:49,460
I'll die in prison.

00:37:49,527 --> 00:37:51,729
Yes, but the people
you'd be feeding off of

00:37:51,796 --> 00:37:53,364
will still be alive.

00:37:55,032 --> 00:37:56,867
Cycle of life.

00:37:58,602 --> 00:38:00,838
Sergeant.

00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:10,047
You're under arrest for
the murder of Terry Manning.

00:38:14,118 --> 00:38:16,220
You have one more question.

00:38:16,287 --> 00:38:19,223
How could
I consume
raw organs?

00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:22,093
Not morally,
aesthetically.

00:38:24,228 --> 00:38:27,231
I dried them
and ground them into powder.

00:38:30,234 --> 00:38:31,836
Protein powder.

00:38:31,902 --> 00:38:37,308
You want
an empirical experience?

00:38:37,375 --> 00:38:39,910
There's a fresh shake
in my fridge.

00:38:39,977 --> 00:38:42,580
Let's go.

00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,688
Officer.

00:38:54,625 --> 00:38:56,360
She is nuts, right?

00:38:59,597 --> 00:39:02,400
She's a cold-blooded killer.

00:39:04,135 --> 00:39:05,736
You got the
warrant, right?

00:39:05,803 --> 00:39:07,505
Yeah, but it's
limited in scope.

00:39:07,571 --> 00:39:09,307
The boyfriend's
an attorney

00:39:09,373 --> 00:39:11,075
so we can't
toss the place.

00:39:11,142 --> 00:39:12,643
Mrs. Dantini.

00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:14,211
You have news

00:39:14,278 --> 00:39:15,346
about Sandy?

00:39:15,413 --> 00:39:17,248
We may have a lead.

00:39:17,315 --> 00:39:19,283
We need to see the clothes
that you wore

00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:20,951
the day that your
daughter died.

00:39:21,018 --> 00:39:21,952
Why?

00:39:22,019 --> 00:39:22,953
It's okay, honey.

00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,622
I'm Hugh Young,
Mrs. Dantini's attorney.

00:39:24,689 --> 00:39:25,856
Carla's grieving.
We both are.

00:39:25,923 --> 00:39:27,525
Can't this wait
till after the funeral?

00:39:27,591 --> 00:39:29,760
No, it can't.

00:39:31,562 --> 00:39:32,930
Where's your bedroom?

00:39:34,332 --> 00:39:36,267
WILLOWS:
So this is everything
that you wore

00:39:36,334 --> 00:39:37,601
at the carnival
last night?

00:39:37,668 --> 00:39:39,670
Yes.

00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:43,708
Your watch is waterlogged.

00:39:48,012 --> 00:39:52,116
Yes. I went into the water
after my daughter.

00:39:52,183 --> 00:39:53,884
So, you jumped in the water.

00:39:53,951 --> 00:39:55,619
Yes.

00:39:59,023 --> 00:40:02,760
How come your shoes are dry?

00:40:02,827 --> 00:40:04,362
Well... it
was yesterday.

00:40:04,428 --> 00:40:06,497
Of course they're dry.

00:40:06,564 --> 00:40:09,734
The lining's blue.

00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,068
If they'd gotten wet

00:40:11,135 --> 00:40:14,639
the indigo dye would have bled
onto your white socks.

00:40:14,705 --> 00:40:16,073
You never went in the water.

00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:17,975
WILLOWS:
If you didn't go
into the water

00:40:18,042 --> 00:40:19,644
how did your watch get wet?

00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:21,112
Like I told her

00:40:21,178 --> 00:40:23,614
reaching for
my daughter.

00:40:23,681 --> 00:40:26,450
You reached for her all right.

00:40:35,459 --> 00:40:36,661
My baby!

00:40:40,831 --> 00:40:43,701
And when she managed
to grab onto you

00:40:43,768 --> 00:40:45,970
you broke her arm.

00:40:46,037 --> 00:40:49,874
And you held her under
while you sat in that car

00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:51,709
until you drowned her.

00:40:51,776 --> 00:40:54,211
YOUNG:
Carla

00:40:54,278 --> 00:40:56,881
is any of this true?

00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:00,951
I want you to leave.

00:41:03,921 --> 00:41:05,323
You took your daughter
to the carnival

00:41:05,389 --> 00:41:06,857
'cause kids get hurt there
all the time.

00:41:06,924 --> 00:41:08,893
You thought the blame
would leave town
with the ride.

00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,361
Well, you should
have planned better.

00:41:10,428 --> 00:41:11,662
What did you actually think?

00:41:11,729 --> 00:41:14,332
That you and your boyfriend
would run off like newlyweds?

00:41:14,398 --> 00:41:16,617
No kid, no cares?

00:41:16,617 --> 00:41:17,952
I never thought
anything like that.

00:41:18,018 --> 00:41:19,386
She did.

00:41:19,453 --> 00:41:21,422
Didn't you?

00:41:27,228 --> 00:41:29,730
I'm going to need a new lawyer.

00:41:36,704 --> 00:41:38,105
Bag the evidence.
Arrest her, Jim.

00:41:40,274 --> 00:41:43,043
Hey...

00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:45,012
you all right?

00:41:45,079 --> 00:41:47,381
Yeah.

00:41:47,448 --> 00:41:48,716
Since we skipped lunch

00:41:48,783 --> 00:41:50,718
you want to get
something to eat?

00:41:50,785 --> 00:41:51,719
Walk it off?

00:41:51,786 --> 00:41:54,021
I got to go home.

00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:57,158
Thanks. Rain check?

00:41:57,224 --> 00:41:58,526
Mm-hmm.

00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,282
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:42:37,298 --> 00:42:39,366
You got my call.

00:42:39,433 --> 00:42:43,637
It couldn't have come
at a better time.
