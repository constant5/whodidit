00:00:00,768 --> 00:00:01,868
<i>Previously on</i> C.S.I.:

00:00:01,868 --> 00:00:04,378
Welcome to Forensics.
Gil Grissom.

00:00:04,378 --> 00:00:05,712
I’m your supervisor
on graveyard.

00:00:05,712 --> 00:00:07,213
Holly Gribbs.

00:00:07,213 --> 00:00:09,956
You’re the fifth person
I’ve been forced to hire.

00:00:09,956 --> 00:00:11,558
Well, that’s not fair.

00:00:11,558 --> 00:00:12,925
You think putting a juiced-in
lieutenant’s daughter

00:00:12,925 --> 00:00:14,260
on the shift is fair?

00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,667
I’m fulfilling her dreams,
not mine.

00:00:16,667 --> 00:00:18,869
I can sit here,
and I can baby you

00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:21,238
and I can tell you to quit,
but I’m not going to do that

00:00:21,238 --> 00:00:22,672
at least until
you’ve solved

00:00:22,672 --> 00:00:24,140
your first, and if, after that,
you don’t feel

00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,175
like King Kong on cocaine...

00:00:26,175 --> 00:00:27,910
then you can quit.

00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:30,045
Grissom, have Warrick shadow
Gribbs for the next three weeks

00:00:30,045 --> 00:00:32,646
or until Nicky makes his
100th, whatever comes first.

00:00:32,646 --> 00:00:34,381
People walk every
day because of you.
Every day!

00:00:34,381 --> 00:00:36,149
That’s enough. That’s enough.
Warrick, let’s go!

00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:38,051
You had him,
and the minute you
started thinking

00:00:38,051 --> 00:00:40,152
about yourself
instead of the
case, you lost him.

00:00:40,152 --> 00:00:41,153
You’ll be okay
on your own?

00:00:41,153 --> 00:00:42,221
Are you kidding?

00:00:42,221 --> 00:00:43,488
I’m fired up,
ready to go.

00:00:43,488 --> 00:00:45,156
Besides, there’s
an officer here.

00:00:45,156 --> 00:00:46,790
I’m sorry, Judge.

00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:48,491
Captain Brass wouldn’t call
you for a search warrant.

00:00:48,491 --> 00:00:50,427
I got a whopper on the line
with a 100-pound test.

00:00:50,427 --> 00:00:52,061
You got a winner for me?

00:00:52,061 --> 00:00:53,229
Favre.

00:00:53,229 --> 00:00:55,497
You put $5,000 down
on the Pack for me

00:00:55,497 --> 00:00:57,598
I’ll give you a blank warrant.

00:00:57,598 --> 00:00:59,033
Congratulations, Nicky, my boy.

00:00:59,033 --> 00:01:00,768
You are now a C.S.I.
Level Three.

00:01:00,768 --> 00:01:01,901
Whoo!

00:01:01,901 --> 00:01:03,903
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

00:01:03,903 --> 00:01:05,504
I’ll be right there.

00:01:05,504 --> 00:01:07,339
Uh, give me ’Niners
for five dimes.

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,908
Weren’t you supposed
to be shadowing Holly?

00:01:10,908 --> 00:01:12,109
Oh. She’s cool.

00:01:12,109 --> 00:01:13,710
She’s doing prints
on that 4-0-7.

00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:14,945
There’s an officer there.

00:01:14,945 --> 00:01:15,946
Excuse me, miss.

00:01:15,946 --> 00:01:16,746
( <i>gasps</i> )

00:01:16,746 --> 00:01:18,548
Holly Gribbs has been shot.

00:01:18,548 --> 00:01:21,950
They don’t think
she’s going to make it.

00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:03,414
Oh!

Hey, look.

00:02:23,029 --> 00:02:25,898
Oh, $40 million.

00:02:25,898 --> 00:02:27,833
Could you imagine?

00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:29,134
Never happen.

00:02:29,134 --> 00:02:31,102
You got a better chance
of going to the moon.

00:02:31,102 --> 00:02:34,505
Woman:
Oh, give me a $20. Hurry!

00:02:34,505 --> 00:02:35,672
I just got a premonition.

00:02:35,672 --> 00:02:37,507
You got your own
money. Go play.

00:02:37,507 --> 00:02:39,441
Woman:
But I left my purse in the room.

00:02:39,441 --> 00:02:42,076
I’ll play.
Wait here.

00:02:44,312 --> 00:02:45,713
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:02:48,581 --> 00:02:49,782
Is this your slot card?

00:02:49,782 --> 00:02:51,951
No.

( <i>handle cranks</i> )

00:02:58,656 --> 00:03:01,358
Your little <i>premonition</i>
just cost me $20.

00:03:01,358 --> 00:03:02,926
Happy now?

00:03:02,926 --> 00:03:04,894
Here.

00:03:06,094 --> 00:03:08,096
Watch out.

00:03:08,096 --> 00:03:09,431
Here come the millions.

You’ll be having
lobster tonight.

00:03:32,248 --> 00:03:34,516
They gave us
the Presidential Suite.

00:03:34,516 --> 00:03:36,384
Can you believe it?

00:03:36,384 --> 00:03:39,620
Here, Richard Gere,
why don’t you let me
help you with that?

00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,988
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:45,858
Thank you.

00:03:47,492 --> 00:03:49,761
Oh! Look at our view!

00:03:52,096 --> 00:03:53,797
Wow!

00:03:56,232 --> 00:03:59,068
Take a hike.

00:03:59,068 --> 00:04:00,970
Get lost.

00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,504
Excuse me?

00:04:02,504 --> 00:04:03,604
Come on, Jamie.

00:04:03,604 --> 00:04:05,106
I’m a millionaire now.

00:04:05,106 --> 00:04:07,841
Now, why would I want
to waste any more time

00:04:07,841 --> 00:04:08,908
with you?

00:04:08,908 --> 00:04:09,909

Grissom:
<i>All right, the minute</i>

00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:17,148
you hear <i>anything</i>
on Holly Gribbs’s condition

00:04:17,148 --> 00:04:18,316
I want you to page me.

00:04:18,316 --> 00:04:20,517
All right? Bye.

00:04:20,517 --> 00:04:23,787
Dispatcher:
...call back
at 4-7-7 Desert Inn Road.

00:04:23,787 --> 00:04:25,554
So he pulled a Louganis, huh?

00:04:25,554 --> 00:04:26,922
Yeah, 150 feet.

00:04:26,922 --> 00:04:28,723
The Gigamillions curse
strikes again.

00:04:28,723 --> 00:04:31,125
Past four winners
ended up dead or missing.

00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:32,126
What do you think,
Grissom?

00:04:32,126 --> 00:04:33,127
It’s a conspiracy.

00:04:33,127 --> 00:04:34,127
Coincidence.

00:04:34,127 --> 00:04:35,628
I worked those
four cases.

00:04:35,628 --> 00:04:37,330
There was never
any evidence of
foul play.

00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:39,064
Was he in town with anybody?

00:04:39,064 --> 00:04:40,432
His girlfriend.

00:04:40,432 --> 00:04:41,800
She’s upstairs
in police custody.

00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,001
Do you want to talk
to her?

00:04:43,001 --> 00:04:44,102
Not yet.

00:04:44,102 --> 00:04:45,669
Right now, I want
to talk to him.

00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:48,271
How do you talk
to a dead body?

00:04:48,271 --> 00:04:49,439
I let him talk

00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:51,173
to me, actually.

00:04:51,173 --> 00:04:53,875
In fact, he just spoke.

00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:55,543
Didn’t you hear him?

00:04:55,543 --> 00:04:59,714
He just told me
that he didn’t
commit suicide.

00:04:59,714 --> 00:05:01,215
No. You-you lost me.

00:05:01,215 --> 00:05:03,883
This guy fell to his death
wearing prescription eyeglasses.

00:05:03,883 --> 00:05:06,452
Jumpers take their glasses off.

( <i>siren blares</i> )

00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,788
Suicide is the ultimate form
of selfishness, detective.

00:05:10,788 --> 00:05:12,156
It’s unlikely that

00:05:12,156 --> 00:05:14,925
anyone cowardly enough
to take his own life

00:05:14,925 --> 00:05:17,960
would be brave enough
to watch his own death.

00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,095
You can tell all that
just by looking

00:05:20,095 --> 00:05:21,363
at a pair of eyeglasses?

00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:23,765

I just got off the phone
with the Sheriff.

He says he wants me
to run the unit.

You’re the boss.

I mean, I can’t say
I didn’t do it to myself.

Where are they going
to place you?

00:06:45,826 --> 00:06:47,327
Homicide. Believe that?

( <i>chuckles</i> )

Instead of moving up,
I’m moving back

00:06:50,029 --> 00:06:52,598
in a time capsule,
like it’s 1979 again.

00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,302
So, I guess, this might put
you and me at odds.

00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:05,608
Yeah.

00:07:07,642 --> 00:07:09,877
You got any advice for me?

Yeah, cover you ass...

00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:13,714

They’re all
yours, pal.

00:07:19,451 --> 00:07:21,220
Tragedy struck early
this morning

00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,654
when an on-duty
Las Vegas criminalist

00:07:23,654 --> 00:07:25,155
was brutally gunned down.

00:07:25,155 --> 00:07:27,257
It was her first night
on the job.

00:07:27,257 --> 00:07:30,627
Victim Holly Gribbs
was investigating

00:07:30,627 --> 00:07:32,594
a robbery/homicide
in an apartment

00:07:32,594 --> 00:07:34,996
on the corner of M.L.K.
and Warm Springs.

00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:37,332
The crime lab now faces
the daunting task

00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:40,300
of investigating the shooting
of one of their own.

00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,937
The wounded C.S.I.
has been taken to Desert Palm

00:07:43,937 --> 00:07:45,738
where she is listed
in critical condition.

00:07:45,738 --> 00:07:48,206
The suspect is still at large.

00:07:48,206 --> 00:07:49,674
Newsman:
In other news...

00:07:49,674 --> 00:07:51,542
Weren’t you supposed to be
shadowing Holly?

00:07:51,542 --> 00:07:52,909
Warrick, man,
what happened?

00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:55,378
I left her to hook up
with Grissom

00:07:55,378 --> 00:07:57,313
on that toenail case...

00:07:57,313 --> 00:07:59,348
and then, I came back here.

00:07:59,348 --> 00:08:00,415
You left Holly solo?

00:08:00,415 --> 00:08:02,416
It was just supposed
to be

00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:04,418
an easy print job.

00:08:04,418 --> 00:08:07,687
Look, I feel bad enough, okay?

00:08:16,527 --> 00:08:18,262
Here’s what we know.

00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:23,832
Brass assigned Warrick
to shadow Holly on a robbery.

00:08:23,832 --> 00:08:26,635
He left her at the scene.

00:08:26,635 --> 00:08:28,770
The suspect returned

00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:31,772
and Holly was shot.

00:08:31,772 --> 00:08:34,174
The sheriff phoned me
earlier this morning.

00:08:34,174 --> 00:08:37,042
Brass has been moved back
to homicide.

00:08:37,042 --> 00:08:39,311
Who’s going to run the unit?

00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:40,545
For now?

00:08:40,545 --> 00:08:41,880
Me.

00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,647
I know.

00:08:43,647 --> 00:08:47,584
We’ll just play it by ear, okay?

00:08:47,584 --> 00:08:49,185
All right.

00:08:49,185 --> 00:08:51,153
Last night, a jackpot winner
took a swan dive

00:08:51,153 --> 00:08:53,989
off the Hotel Monaco
about the time Holly was shot.

00:08:53,989 --> 00:08:55,556
I’m going to work the leaper.

00:08:55,556 --> 00:08:56,691
Nick?

00:08:56,691 --> 00:08:57,858
Yes, sir.

00:08:57,858 --> 00:08:59,293
You work the Holly case.

00:08:59,293 --> 00:09:00,394
Wait a minute.

00:09:00,394 --> 00:09:02,929
Uh, you-you can’t give him
the Holly case.

00:09:02,929 --> 00:09:04,197
I mean, all due
respect, Nick.

00:09:04,197 --> 00:09:05,931
I want this one.
Nicky is the only one

00:09:05,931 --> 00:09:08,033
that didn’t have
any personal contact with Holly.

00:09:08,033 --> 00:09:09,567
I don’t want you on this,
Catherine.

00:09:09,567 --> 00:09:11,302
Why?
Because you’re

00:09:11,302 --> 00:09:12,103
emotionally involved.

00:09:12,103 --> 00:09:13,437
Yeah. She was going to walk.

00:09:13,437 --> 00:09:15,205
I convinced her to stay.

00:09:15,205 --> 00:09:18,340
If anyone’s to blame here,
it’s me, and I want this case.

00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,674
Fire me.

00:09:19,674 --> 00:09:21,209
I’m not firing anybody.

00:09:21,209 --> 00:09:22,777
Look. I know we’re pulling
a double.

00:09:22,777 --> 00:09:23,844
We’re on edge
’cause of Holly.

00:09:23,844 --> 00:09:25,379
I just want everyone
to stay calm

00:09:25,379 --> 00:09:28,215
and to do their jobs
for the next ten hours.

00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:31,583
And as of now

00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:33,218
we’re short of help.

00:09:33,218 --> 00:09:36,321
So I’m bringing in
Sara Sidle to give us a hand.

00:09:36,321 --> 00:09:38,022
Sara Sidle?

00:09:38,022 --> 00:09:40,023
Who’s that?
She’s a C.S.I. out
of San Francisco.

00:09:40,023 --> 00:09:42,959
She’s a friend of mine,
someone I trust.

00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,293
She’s going to handle
our internal investigation

00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,462
and I want to keep this
in-house.

00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:49,363
I don’t want I.A. involved.

00:09:49,363 --> 00:09:53,834
Great, that’s just what we need,
somebody sniffing around.

00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:00,439
Nicky, you can back me up
on the D.B. at the Monaco.

00:10:00,439 --> 00:10:01,740
You got it.

00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,074
That’s it.

00:10:06,343 --> 00:10:07,977
That’s it?

00:10:10,612 --> 00:10:12,881
What about me?

00:10:12,881 --> 00:10:13,915
You’re on leave.

00:10:13,915 --> 00:10:15,116
You get some personal time.

00:10:15,116 --> 00:10:16,651
I don’t want any personal time.

00:10:16,651 --> 00:10:17,652
I want to help.

00:10:17,652 --> 00:10:19,719
You’re the boss now.

00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:22,588
You can reinstate me.

00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:24,390
Go home, Warrick.

00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:27,159
Get your story straight
before Sara gets here.

00:10:40,068 --> 00:10:42,003
A little late
for the brigade.

00:10:44,872 --> 00:10:46,907
What do you think
happened here?

00:10:49,408 --> 00:10:51,143
First blush?

00:10:54,645 --> 00:10:55,880
Don’t move.

00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,916
Hey, it’s okay.
I’m not a cop.

00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:00,984
I just...
I just analyze the scene.

00:11:00,984 --> 00:11:04,887
( <i>gunshots firing</i> )

( <i>sighs deeply</i> )

00:11:11,358 --> 00:11:13,293
This is Holly’s gun.

00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:21,299
She shot back.

00:11:21,299 --> 00:11:22,433
( <i>pager beeps</i> )

00:11:26,136 --> 00:11:27,937
( <i>beeping continues</i> )

00:11:39,513 --> 00:11:40,580
He’s all rigored up.

00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:43,549
Now pull it like
a slot machine.

00:11:43,549 --> 00:11:45,483
It’s been three weeks
since my last jumper.

00:11:45,483 --> 00:11:47,919
At least this one
died a millionaire.

00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:52,389
( <i>groans</i> )

00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:56,125
Jeez, these look like
defensive wounds, maybe.

00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:59,094
Somebody came after this guy
with something pretty sharp.

00:12:00,229 --> 00:12:02,396
You have any idea
what it might be?

00:12:02,396 --> 00:12:03,997
Glass, maybe.

00:12:03,997 --> 00:12:06,766
We found tiny shards
in the incised wound.

00:12:06,766 --> 00:12:10,836
Take a look.

00:12:10,836 --> 00:12:13,238
Grissom:
Not just glass--

00:12:13,238 --> 00:12:16,206
black glass.

00:12:22,278 --> 00:12:24,980
Broken glass.

00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:28,550
Blood drops,
leading to...

00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,617
bloody towels.

00:12:29,617 --> 00:12:32,152
No effort to hide.

00:12:32,152 --> 00:12:33,620
Hey!

00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,255
Defensive wounds.

00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:36,756
Champagne bottle.
Black glass.

00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,490
I missed that.

00:12:43,794 --> 00:12:45,696
What do you think, boss?

00:12:45,696 --> 00:12:46,896
You’re C.S.I. Three, now.

00:12:46,896 --> 00:12:48,398
You call it.

00:12:48,398 --> 00:12:50,299
What? You want me
to play it blind?

00:12:50,299 --> 00:12:51,900
You’ve read the
woman’s statement.

00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,802
The room is full of
evidentiary clues.

00:12:54,802 --> 00:12:56,604
Talk it out.

00:12:56,604 --> 00:12:58,338
What does the room say?

00:13:00,206 --> 00:13:01,407
Okay.

00:13:03,542 --> 00:13:05,711
Well, according
to the girlfriend’s statement

00:13:05,711 --> 00:13:08,746
they were on the balcony
when they had a lovers’ quarrel.

00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:10,681
Come on, Jamie.

00:13:10,681 --> 00:13:13,083
I’m a millionaire now.

00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,750
Now, why would I want to waste

00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,486
any more time
with you?

00:13:16,486 --> 00:13:18,587
( <i>knocking at door</i> )

Thank you.

00:13:23,657 --> 00:13:25,025
You’re welcome.

00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:27,927
So what was I
this whole time, huh?

00:13:27,927 --> 00:13:29,395
Just someone to bang?

00:13:29,395 --> 00:13:30,762
Yeah.

Crazy broad!

00:13:42,638 --> 00:13:44,340
And then what happened?

00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,808
He took off.

00:13:46,808 --> 00:13:48,309
I cut him up pretty good.

00:13:48,309 --> 00:13:50,844
He probably went to the lobby
to fetch some first aid.

00:13:50,844 --> 00:13:53,814
And he never came back
to the room?

00:13:53,814 --> 00:13:55,815
No.

00:13:55,815 --> 00:13:57,316
You sure?

00:13:57,316 --> 00:13:59,618
The Presidential Suite
at the Hotel Monaco

00:13:59,618 --> 00:14:00,752
is a secured room.

00:14:00,752 --> 00:14:02,353
They keep a log.

00:14:02,353 --> 00:14:04,287
Every time someone enters
with a card key...

00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:06,523
Well, if they
keep a <i>record</i>

00:14:06,523 --> 00:14:08,190
check it for
yourself.

00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:10,192
Why are you bothering me?

00:14:10,192 --> 00:14:13,862
Nicky, what does the log say?

00:14:13,862 --> 00:14:15,263
Nicky:
Well, she’s right.

00:14:15,263 --> 00:14:17,965
The only entry I see here
is when hotel security

00:14:17,965 --> 00:14:18,965
checked them in.

00:14:18,965 --> 00:14:21,334
Can I go now?

00:14:21,334 --> 00:14:23,202
Yes, Ma’am.

00:14:30,574 --> 00:14:31,575

She doesn’t have
any financial motive.

00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,578
She was his girlfriend,
not his wife.

00:14:35,578 --> 00:14:38,647
Any money won by the deceased
goes directly

00:14:38,647 --> 00:14:39,981
to the family estate.

00:14:39,981 --> 00:14:41,983
Well, if he didn’t fall
from his own balcony

00:14:41,983 --> 00:14:43,817
where else could
it have happened?

00:14:43,817 --> 00:14:46,919
The roof.

00:18:34,024 --> 00:18:35,057
Don’t feel bad.

00:18:35,057 --> 00:18:36,091
My last four traces

00:18:36,091 --> 00:18:39,060
came back Eminem, so...

00:18:40,461 --> 00:18:43,364
Look, you seem to have
everything under control here.

00:18:43,364 --> 00:18:46,233
Where can I find Warrick Brown?

00:18:46,233 --> 00:18:47,834
Try one of
the casinos

00:18:47,834 --> 00:18:49,668
on Blue Diamond Road.

00:18:54,172 --> 00:18:55,840
Oh, I’ll
page you

00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,207
with any information.

00:19:10,951 --> 00:19:12,118
There’s our jumper.

00:19:12,118 --> 00:19:14,019
So, you want
to see everything

00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:16,021
one minute before
and one minute after

00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:17,522
he won the
jackpot, right?

00:19:17,522 --> 00:19:18,657
Please.

00:19:20,158 --> 00:19:22,560
Wait a minute.

00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,294
Go back.

00:19:25,828 --> 00:19:28,264
There! It looks like

00:19:28,264 --> 00:19:30,299
she’s offering him his
slot redemption card back.

00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:33,868
Could I see the person
that was sitting at this machine

00:19:33,868 --> 00:19:35,603
right before the victim?

00:19:35,603 --> 00:19:36,771
Sure.

00:19:39,973 --> 00:19:41,474
Is there any way
of telling how long

00:19:41,474 --> 00:19:43,576
he was sitting there?

00:19:50,914 --> 00:19:53,183
Man:
11 hours,
13 minutes...

00:19:53,183 --> 00:19:55,050
15 seconds.

00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:56,518
At three bucks a tug

00:19:56,518 --> 00:20:00,454
hell, he could have gone
through ten, 20 thou.

00:20:03,323 --> 00:20:06,159
Grissom:
Nick, call the slot host.

00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,160
Get this guy’s name
from the slot card.

00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,861
I want to talk
to this man.

00:20:09,861 --> 00:20:11,763
All right.

00:20:11,763 --> 00:20:12,798
Here you go.

00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:14,632
Holly’s weapon’s
already loaded.

00:20:14,632 --> 00:20:16,666
So just point at the
gun entry hole there
to do your test fire.

00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:18,368
Okay, thanks, Bobby.

00:20:30,311 --> 00:20:35,014
Okay, now, in order
to eliminate Holly’s gun
as the possible weapon

00:20:35,014 --> 00:20:37,382
we start by looking
for imperfections

00:20:37,382 --> 00:20:39,083
in the bullet’s stria...

00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:42,686
Now, that’s odd.

00:20:42,686 --> 00:20:44,121
What’s wrong?

00:20:44,121 --> 00:20:45,288
We don’t have
an elimination.

00:20:45,288 --> 00:20:46,723
We got a match.

00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:58,164
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:20:58,164 --> 00:21:00,967
Shot her with her own gun.

00:21:00,967 --> 00:21:02,335
It’s okay, I’m not a cop.

00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:04,269
I just...
I just analyze the scene.

00:21:04,269 --> 00:21:05,403
Throw the gun down!

00:21:05,403 --> 00:21:07,038
All right now,
yank the phone

00:21:07,038 --> 00:21:08,539
out of the wall.

00:21:08,539 --> 00:21:10,507
I’m taking my
prints with me.

( <i>door slams</i> )

00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:31,456
I pulled the slot card
for you.

00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:32,991
That’s the gentleman,
right over there.

00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:33,991
Thank you.

00:21:33,991 --> 00:21:35,025
Mm-hmm.

00:21:35,025 --> 00:21:36,493
Hold this.

00:21:36,493 --> 00:21:38,362
I think I’ll play
a little.

00:21:40,096 --> 00:21:43,131
( <i>indistinct chatting</i> )

00:21:43,131 --> 00:21:45,367
( <i>bells ringing</i> )

00:21:45,367 --> 00:21:47,168
Double down,
now baby.

00:21:47,168 --> 00:21:48,835
Oh, yes, a winner.

00:21:48,835 --> 00:21:50,237
The winner.

00:21:52,105 --> 00:21:54,540
Double nine.
Jacks or better.

00:21:58,142 --> 00:21:59,277
You’re under arrest.

00:21:59,277 --> 00:22:01,245
Oh yeah?

00:22:01,245 --> 00:22:02,480
What for?

00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,814
First-degree murder.

00:22:03,814 --> 00:22:05,648
Oh.

00:22:05,648 --> 00:22:07,984
On what grounds?

00:22:07,984 --> 00:22:10,419
Roof dust.

00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:14,422
Sir, would you please
come with us?

00:22:16,856 --> 00:22:18,024
( <i>bells dinging</i> )

00:22:18,024 --> 00:22:19,258
( <i>coins falling</i> )

00:22:19,258 --> 00:22:21,660
Nicky, my boy,
collect my winnings.

00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:24,196
It’s a C.S.I. Three
initiation.

00:22:41,009 --> 00:22:42,075
You’re up 11 Gs.

00:22:42,075 --> 00:22:44,277
Hit or stay?

00:22:44,277 --> 00:22:45,412
Stay.

00:22:45,412 --> 00:22:47,479
I want to talk to you.

00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:53,984
You were playing $100
on every spot.

00:22:53,984 --> 00:22:56,520
You have a system?

00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,355
I’m counting cards.

00:22:58,355 --> 00:22:59,555
Isn’t that illegal?

00:22:59,555 --> 00:23:02,358
Not if you do the
math in your head.

00:23:02,358 --> 00:23:04,926
You play anything else?

00:23:06,694 --> 00:23:09,830
I bet sports from time to time.

00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:12,032
So...

00:23:12,032 --> 00:23:13,799
let me get this straight.

00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:16,601
You were assigned by Brass
to shadow a trainee.

00:23:16,601 --> 00:23:19,704
A robbery comes up on M.L.K,
and you go for coffee.

00:23:19,704 --> 00:23:21,072
An officer
was there.

00:23:21,072 --> 00:23:22,606
So you felt safe
to leave.

00:23:22,606 --> 00:23:25,475
Do you know the policies
and procedures

00:23:25,475 --> 00:23:26,676
for clearing a scene?

00:23:26,676 --> 00:23:27,476
Yes.

00:23:27,476 --> 00:23:29,211
Then, why’d you leave?

00:23:29,211 --> 00:23:30,446
I mean,
what was so important

00:23:30,446 --> 00:23:31,847
that you had
to rush out of there?

00:23:31,847 --> 00:23:33,581
I told you.

00:23:33,581 --> 00:23:34,949
I went for coffee.

00:23:34,949 --> 00:23:37,784
Was that before
or after you made your bets?

00:23:37,784 --> 00:23:40,186
Sunday...

00:23:40,186 --> 00:23:41,487
Vegas...

00:23:41,487 --> 00:23:43,121
NFL football...

00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:44,256
guy like you...

00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,623
Come on,
you trying to tell me

00:23:45,623 --> 00:23:47,358
that you didn’t make
a little pit stop?

00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,361
Look at me.

00:23:51,361 --> 00:23:54,163
Did you log on...

00:23:54,163 --> 00:23:56,131
tell dispatch where
you were going?

00:23:56,131 --> 00:23:57,499
Do you know how many times

00:23:57,499 --> 00:23:59,200
I’ve been left alone
at a crime scene

00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,334
when I was a rookie?

00:24:00,334 --> 00:24:03,503
Yeah, well,
this time is different.

00:24:03,503 --> 00:24:05,638
Yeah, why’s that?

00:24:05,638 --> 00:24:07,473
Holly Gribbs died
on the operating table

00:24:07,473 --> 00:24:09,975
20 minutes ago.

00:24:20,949 --> 00:24:23,886
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:25:05,183 --> 00:25:07,484
Mind if I get a soda?

00:25:08,885 --> 00:25:11,321
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

00:25:11,321 --> 00:25:13,723
You want one?

00:25:13,723 --> 00:25:16,125
Is there anything
in there with alcohol?

00:25:16,125 --> 00:25:17,759
Root beer.

00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:20,128
No.

00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:23,831
( <i>pager beeping</i> )

00:25:23,831 --> 00:25:24,664

( <i>beeping continues</i> )

00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:30,502
Oh... God.

00:25:33,238 --> 00:25:34,805
What are you going to say?

00:25:34,805 --> 00:25:36,573
"Hi, I’m a criminalist.
I was in the neighborhood..."

00:25:36,573 --> 00:25:38,441
Shh. It’s ringing.

00:25:38,441 --> 00:25:40,376
Hello.

00:25:40,376 --> 00:25:42,377
Uh, hey.

00:25:42,377 --> 00:25:43,611
Hey, who’s this?

00:25:43,611 --> 00:25:44,779
I just dialed
my own damn beeper.

00:25:44,779 --> 00:25:46,814
Uh-uh. It’s my beeper now.

00:25:46,814 --> 00:25:47,915
I found it.

00:25:47,915 --> 00:25:50,216
It ain’t your beeper, girl.

00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:51,484
It’s mine.

00:25:51,484 --> 00:25:53,486
I do a lot of business
on that beeper.

00:25:53,486 --> 00:25:54,887
What kind of business?

00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:55,988
You know--

00:25:55,988 --> 00:25:58,389
Slinging a little
something-something.

00:25:58,389 --> 00:26:00,858
Oh, a little
something-something.

00:26:00,858 --> 00:26:03,593
Or maybe a little bling-bling?

00:26:03,593 --> 00:26:07,529
So what you know
about some bling-bling?

00:26:07,529 --> 00:26:09,398
Well, invite me over
to your crib, baby

00:26:09,398 --> 00:26:11,232
and you might find out.

00:26:11,232 --> 00:26:12,233
It’s on.

00:26:28,979 --> 00:26:32,115
Got me.

00:26:32,115 --> 00:26:34,383
Yeah, I was up on that roof.

00:26:34,383 --> 00:26:37,252
I didn’t push him off.

00:26:37,252 --> 00:26:38,987
I did talk to him, though.

00:26:38,987 --> 00:26:40,254
We know.

00:26:40,254 --> 00:26:41,855

00:26:41,855 --> 00:26:44,324
Gin and tonic or amaretto sours?

00:26:44,324 --> 00:26:46,325
Amaretto sours.
How’d you know that?

00:26:46,325 --> 00:26:49,395
We got a record
of the victim’s
room charges.

00:26:49,395 --> 00:26:50,395
Chief.

00:26:50,395 --> 00:26:51,930
At 1:27 a.m.

00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:55,065
our victim, Ted Salinger, made
a couple of purchases

00:26:55,065 --> 00:26:56,533
in the gift shop--

00:26:56,533 --> 00:26:59,435
<i>Band-Aids and antiseptic.</i>

00:26:59,435 --> 00:27:00,836
<i>At 1:40 a.m.</i>

00:27:00,836 --> 00:27:04,072
we tracked a purchase
at the La Promenade--

00:27:06,507 --> 00:27:10,811
<i>A $30,000 designer watch.</i>

00:27:10,811 --> 00:27:14,546
At 1:45 a.m., you both started
knocking them back

00:27:14,546 --> 00:27:16,215
in the hotel bar.

00:27:16,215 --> 00:27:17,916
Sweet.

00:27:17,916 --> 00:27:18,917
Hey.

00:27:18,917 --> 00:27:20,051
You won my money.

00:27:20,051 --> 00:27:21,051
What?

00:27:21,051 --> 00:27:22,385
That was my machine.

00:27:22,385 --> 00:27:24,821
I put everything I had
in that machine.

00:27:24,821 --> 00:27:26,355
So you’re a degenerate.

00:27:26,355 --> 00:27:27,990
What do you want from me?

00:27:31,826 --> 00:27:33,694
Hey, old timer,
come on, sit down.

00:27:33,694 --> 00:27:35,729
I’ll buy you a drink
for second place.

00:27:35,729 --> 00:27:37,564
What are you having?
It’s on me.

00:27:37,564 --> 00:27:39,432
It’s on you? All right.

00:27:39,432 --> 00:27:41,934
In that case,
I’ll have a, uh...

00:27:41,934 --> 00:27:43,101
amaretto sour.

00:27:43,101 --> 00:27:45,803
The first hour, you both drank
tit for tat

00:27:45,803 --> 00:27:48,772
but by hour two,
Ted started ordering doubles...

00:27:48,772 --> 00:27:50,707
And you quit drinking.

00:27:50,707 --> 00:27:53,509
Drank decaf coffee instead.

00:27:53,509 --> 00:27:55,044
My guess is
that you were

00:27:55,044 --> 00:27:58,112
getting him lathered up
for your little elevator ride.

00:27:58,112 --> 00:28:00,481
Have a nice life, huh?

00:28:00,481 --> 00:28:01,982
I know I will.

00:28:01,982 --> 00:28:02,983
( <i>laughing</i> )

00:28:02,983 --> 00:28:06,452
And from there,
you went to the roof.

00:28:31,671 --> 00:28:33,338
( <i>crying</i> )

00:28:33,338 --> 00:28:36,208
I couldn’t go through with it.

00:28:36,208 --> 00:28:38,042
I’m a born failure.

00:28:38,042 --> 00:28:40,778
I failed at my marriage;
I failed at my work.

00:28:40,778 --> 00:28:44,514
Then I couldn’t even
commit suicide right.

00:28:48,817 --> 00:28:52,487
One pull away...
the story of my life.

00:28:56,923 --> 00:28:59,058
Mr. Carlton,
we’re not detectives.

00:28:59,058 --> 00:29:00,893
We’re crime scene analysts.

00:29:00,893 --> 00:29:03,528
We’re trained to ignore
verbal accounts

00:29:03,528 --> 00:29:05,663
and rely instead
on the evidence

00:29:05,663 --> 00:29:07,631
a scene sets before us.

00:29:07,631 --> 00:29:11,201
But I have to be honest
with you, Red...

00:29:11,201 --> 00:29:13,002
I believe you.

00:29:13,002 --> 00:29:14,837
I do.

00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:18,706
So...

00:29:18,706 --> 00:29:21,341
here’s what we’re going to do:

00:29:21,341 --> 00:29:24,076
you’re going to stay here
until we get back.

00:29:24,076 --> 00:29:26,212
If you pushed this guy
off the roof

00:29:26,212 --> 00:29:29,180
he will, without a doubt,
have roof dust on his shoes.

00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:31,182
If he does

00:29:31,182 --> 00:29:34,184
we’ll have you arrested
for murder.

00:29:34,184 --> 00:29:38,587
But if dust is not present,
then you’ll be free to go.

00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:48,662
I like this guy.

00:30:37,966 --> 00:30:41,468
For a conviction,
we’re going to need
a DNA sample.

Okay, let’s sit him down.

00:30:49,608 --> 00:30:51,142
we got him.

is in custody.

In case you need me.

00:31:51,121 --> 00:31:53,756
I probably do.

00:31:53,756 --> 00:31:56,925
But this is something
I’d rather do alone.

00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:02,129

Okay.

00:33:02,874 --> 00:33:05,009
I’m sorry.

stand up?

00:33:17,551 --> 00:33:20,688
You’re too young to remember
who Red Skelton was.

Hey, Nick at Nite.

00:33:22,155 --> 00:33:24,156
You should
check it out.

00:33:33,097 --> 00:33:34,631
No dust.

00:33:34,631 --> 00:33:35,899
Great.

00:33:35,899 --> 00:33:37,166
I thought so.

00:33:37,166 --> 00:33:40,302
Turns out he’s red herring.

00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:45,439
There’s got to be
something else.

00:34:01,518 --> 00:34:03,353
Nice watch.

00:34:06,788 --> 00:34:08,857
Look at this.

00:34:09,991 --> 00:34:12,793
These look like fibers.

00:34:12,793 --> 00:34:14,694
Yeah. You think he was dragged?

00:34:14,694 --> 00:34:17,130
Maybe.

00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:19,365
Well, I’ll go back
to the presidential suite...

00:34:19,365 --> 00:34:22,134
take a swatch of the carpet,
see if we can match the fibers.

00:34:22,134 --> 00:34:24,569
Get ahold of the girl
while you’re at it.

00:34:24,569 --> 00:34:25,702
Why, is she a suspect?

00:34:25,702 --> 00:34:27,838
She is now.

00:34:27,838 --> 00:34:29,840
All right.

Hey. I thought you
might like to see this.

What the

00:34:43,583 --> 00:34:45,051
I found it
after I shaved his head.

with a diamond

You find that,
I bet you find your killer.

Was this first blow?

00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:55,459
First and fatal.

00:34:55,459 --> 00:34:56,425
Crushed his skull.

00:34:56,425 --> 00:34:58,394
So he was killed,
then he was pushed.

00:34:58,394 --> 00:35:00,896
Without a doubt.

00:42:14,488 --> 00:42:17,690
I didn’t even think
I was doing anything wrong.

00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:19,852
Never occurred to me.

00:42:21,719 --> 00:42:24,886
It never occurred
to me, either.

00:42:27,186 --> 00:42:29,319
You know what?

00:42:29,319 --> 00:42:31,452
If I let you go

00:42:31,452 --> 00:42:34,852
I got to let me go, too.

00:42:34,852 --> 00:42:37,452
And Catherine and Brass,
we’re all culpable in this.

00:42:37,452 --> 00:42:40,186
I don’t care
what the book says.

00:42:40,186 --> 00:42:41,486
I lost one good person today.

00:42:41,486 --> 00:42:43,452
I don’t want
to lose another--here.

00:42:55,286 --> 00:42:58,652
I won’t let
you down again.

00:43:37,152 --> 00:43:39,819
Let’s go home.
