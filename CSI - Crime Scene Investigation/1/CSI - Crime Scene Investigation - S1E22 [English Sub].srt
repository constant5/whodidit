What's my grandson
looking at?

If he talks,
he'll be dead
inside a month.

00:07:26,698 --> 00:07:29,968
Now, if he keeps quiet,
the D.A. will put
the squeeze on him

00:07:30,035 --> 00:07:33,005
and he'll probably
end up in the big house.

your advice would be.

the creepiest thing.

00:09:20,646 --> 00:09:22,614

on the Internet

00:09:22,681 --> 00:09:24,616

a round-trip ticket

00:09:49,908 --> 00:09:51,310
This guy was weird.

00:09:51,376 --> 00:09:52,744
Like way weird.

00:09:52,811 --> 00:09:54,146
I was thinking

00:09:54,212 --> 00:09:56,381
that he was going to pull a
<i>Silence of the Lambs</i>

00:09:56,448 --> 00:09:58,917
on me and tell me to "put
the lotion in the basket."

00:10:07,259 --> 00:10:08,927
You know what I think?

00:10:08,994 --> 00:10:11,496
I don't think you two
are murderers.

00:10:11,563 --> 00:10:13,131
I think you're
just felony stupid

00:10:13,198 --> 00:10:15,233
but for now,
you're being booked

00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,502
on evading arrest,
grand theft auto

00:10:17,569 --> 00:10:19,972
DWI.

00:10:20,038 --> 00:10:22,207
You go
with this officer here.

00:10:25,877 --> 00:10:28,880
MAN ( <i>over P.A. system):</i>
Stabbing in Barracks A.

00:10:28,947 --> 00:10:30,182
Lock down in effect.

00:10:30,248 --> 00:10:32,117
Guards to their post, please.

00:10:33,785 --> 00:10:37,122
I love my Grandpa--
don't get me wrong--

00:10:37,189 --> 00:10:40,659
but he's got no idea
how it works in here

00:10:40,726 --> 00:10:43,395
and I'm not sure
you do, either.

00:10:43,462 --> 00:10:46,565
Why don't you tell me?

00:10:46,632 --> 00:10:49,701
First off, this place
only sees two colors:
black and white.

00:10:49,768 --> 00:10:50,969
You stay with your own.

00:10:51,036 --> 00:10:53,138
Despite what those
Chucks think upstairs

00:10:53,205 --> 00:10:56,742
this entire place is
infiltrated with Rolling 60s.

00:10:56,808 --> 00:10:58,877
Overflow from L.A.

00:10:58,944 --> 00:11:00,979
Lot of education
in a short time, huh?

00:11:01,046 --> 00:11:02,347
Yeah.

00:11:02,414 --> 00:11:05,784
I mean, I'm just trying
to survive, man.

00:11:05,851 --> 00:11:07,886
I'm 60 days

00:11:07,953 --> 00:11:09,721
and a wake-up
unless I get got.

00:11:09,788 --> 00:11:12,157
James, why don't you take
a deep breath

00:11:12,224 --> 00:11:14,126
and tell me what happened here?

00:11:14,192 --> 00:11:16,328
First you got to
tell me something.

00:11:16,395 --> 00:11:18,864
You got to tell me
what side you're on.

00:11:18,931 --> 00:11:22,134
Who's side I'm on?

00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,702
Who reached out to you, man?

00:11:23,769 --> 00:11:25,737
Who put me in here?

00:11:25,804 --> 00:11:28,106
James, I'm trying to help you.

00:11:35,047 --> 00:11:36,448
All right.

00:11:39,451 --> 00:11:41,153
Breaks down
like this--

00:11:41,219 --> 00:11:43,322
<i>Kingpin from Gerson Park</i>
<i>and Kingpin</i>

00:11:43,388 --> 00:11:45,958
<i>from L.A. County/Slauson</i>
<i>both under one roof.</i>

00:11:46,024 --> 00:11:48,827
<i>It was time for one of them</i>
<i>to stake their claim.</i>

00:11:48,894 --> 00:11:51,897
<i>Vegas fool got shanked.</i>

00:11:51,964 --> 00:11:53,432
<i>I was sitting right there.</i>

00:11:55,734 --> 00:11:58,604
<i>Since I'm the new face</i>
<i>and only witness</i>

00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:01,239
<i>lot of fingers pointed</i>
<i>towards me.</i>

00:12:03,909 --> 00:12:06,345
So, it's your life versus time.

00:12:06,411 --> 00:12:08,847
Basically, yeah

00:12:08,914 --> 00:12:10,682
and everybody
knows about it.

00:12:10,749 --> 00:12:13,552
They're just waiting to see
what I'm going to do.

00:12:13,619 --> 00:12:16,655
I sing... they send
me a song back.

00:12:18,624 --> 00:12:21,560
I shut up...
I'm your age when I get out.

00:12:30,502 --> 00:12:31,737
Who found the body?

00:12:31,803 --> 00:12:33,138
MAN:
Department
of Agriculture.

00:12:33,205 --> 00:12:35,607
They were searching
for wild horses in their chopper

00:12:35,674 --> 00:12:36,608
when they found it.

00:12:36,675 --> 00:12:38,777
None of the boys

00:12:38,844 --> 00:12:39,978
would even go near it.

00:12:40,045 --> 00:12:42,214
I had to tape
the perimeter myself.

00:12:42,281 --> 00:12:43,448
Where is "it"?

00:12:43,515 --> 00:12:45,450
Just follow my prints.

00:12:57,896 --> 00:12:59,298
Oh, man.

00:13:04,503 --> 00:13:06,805
It's the rest of him.

00:13:06,872 --> 00:13:08,173
It looks like
he's been skinned.

00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,609
Uh... Hands and feet

00:13:10,676 --> 00:13:12,678
have been
amputated.

00:13:12,744 --> 00:13:14,246
Yeah.

00:13:14,313 --> 00:13:16,048
Most likely to avoid I.D.

00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:19,885
Hey, Sara?

00:13:19,952 --> 00:13:20,919
Yeah?

00:13:20,986 --> 00:13:23,689
No approaching surface prints.

00:13:23,755 --> 00:13:26,191
No tire tracks.

00:13:26,258 --> 00:13:27,159
Only O'Riley's
boot prints.

00:13:27,225 --> 00:13:28,660
These are ours.

00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:33,031
Look at the area
around the corpse.

00:13:33,098 --> 00:13:35,968
Look at the big dent
in the ground,
like a meteor hit.

00:13:46,445 --> 00:13:48,146
INMATE:
That guy's from
the crime lab.

00:13:48,213 --> 00:13:50,983
You gonna spray
some chemical stuff
over the barracks, man?

00:13:51,049 --> 00:13:52,718
Hey, what you got
in the tackle box, man?

00:13:52,784 --> 00:13:53,719
You going fishing?

00:13:53,785 --> 00:13:54,853
Hey, brother,
what's up?

00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,421
Let me talk to you
real quick.

00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,625
Welcome to juvie.

00:13:59,691 --> 00:14:00,993
It's all yours.

00:15:17,356 --> 00:15:19,224
I'm not sure you
should be doing this.

00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:20,492
What are we doing?

00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:22,261
Walking through the garage.

00:15:22,328 --> 00:15:26,131
Snooping for trace on
Grissom and Catherine's
stolen BMW?

00:15:26,198 --> 00:15:28,300
All right.
It's simple.

00:15:28,367 --> 00:15:30,569
We got the body,
they got the head.

00:15:30,636 --> 00:15:31,937
The BMW's fair game.

00:15:32,004 --> 00:15:34,807
Come on, Sara,
where's your "Noriega"?

00:15:34,873 --> 00:15:36,575
What has gotten
into you?

00:15:36,642 --> 00:15:37,977
Grissom.

00:16:09,441 --> 00:16:12,011
Uh... Sara...

00:16:12,077 --> 00:16:13,912
want to take a look at this?

00:16:13,979 --> 00:16:15,547
It's like nothing
I've seen before--

00:16:15,614 --> 00:16:17,016
honestly, Gil--
in all my years.

00:16:17,082 --> 00:16:18,350
The head or the torso?

00:16:18,417 --> 00:16:19,485
Torso.

00:16:19,551 --> 00:16:21,120
Look at the width
of the ribcage--

00:16:21,186 --> 00:16:24,089
it's enormous--
and the shoulders
are significantly

00:16:24,156 --> 00:16:25,624
larger in proportion and size

00:16:25,691 --> 00:16:27,292
compared to
the average endomorph.

00:16:27,359 --> 00:16:29,395
The bone structure
is disproportionate.

00:16:29,461 --> 00:16:32,197
Correct.

00:16:32,264 --> 00:16:34,633
I measured the tibia
and fibula around
the ankle area

00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,934
then the radius
and the ulna

00:16:36,001 --> 00:16:37,803
at the wrists--
the bones are 10-15% larger

00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,171
than the standard
Homo sapiens.

00:16:39,238 --> 00:16:40,906
Left fracture

00:16:40,973 --> 00:16:42,908
of the ischial prominence
of the pelvis.

00:16:42,975 --> 00:16:44,343
Fracture of the pubis synphisus.

00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:46,312
Fracture of
the lumbar spine vertebrae...

00:16:46,378 --> 00:16:48,080
Anything <i>not</i> broken?

00:16:48,147 --> 00:16:51,250
No, the trauma's similar to some
of the leapers I get in here:

00:16:51,317 --> 00:16:54,386
out of state, out of cash
and out the window.

00:16:54,453 --> 00:16:55,754
Suicide by hotel.

00:16:55,821 --> 00:16:57,323
This was not a hotel.

00:16:57,389 --> 00:16:59,391
What you see here
is the flattening
and expansion

00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:00,993
of the body
that could only be caused

00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,628
by the impact
of a very steep fall.

00:17:04,496 --> 00:17:07,399
If I know anything, I know
two unequivocal truths:

00:17:07,466 --> 00:17:10,502
DaSilva's head
does not belong
to this body.

00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:11,970
And the reason I know that

00:17:12,037 --> 00:17:13,472
is because the torso
is not human.

00:17:13,539 --> 00:17:16,342
What is it?

00:17:16,408 --> 00:17:18,978
I don't know.

00:17:19,044 --> 00:17:21,747
You're going to need
an anthropologist.

00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:32,958
Mm-hmm.

00:17:33,025 --> 00:17:34,660
Uh-huh.

00:17:39,565 --> 00:17:41,667
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:17:41,734 --> 00:17:43,936
Squirrels love 'em...

00:17:44,003 --> 00:17:45,804
they get tossed
at Dodger Stadium

00:17:45,871 --> 00:17:47,406
and they make a
hell of a butter.

00:17:47,473 --> 00:17:48,974
You're nuts.
You know that.

00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:51,110
Exacta mundo.

00:17:52,611 --> 00:17:55,114
Peanuts!
Right scope's the shell

00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,749
left scope's
the skin of the nut.

00:17:56,815 --> 00:17:58,083
Think "peanuts EspaÃÂ±ol."

00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:00,786
Peanuts on the gas pedal.
You're kidding.

00:18:00,853 --> 00:18:01,887
Mm-mm.

00:18:01,954 --> 00:18:04,023
That's one of those funny clues.

00:18:04,089 --> 00:18:06,925
Could mean nothing,
could mean everything.

00:18:06,992 --> 00:18:08,293
Hmm.

00:18:13,432 --> 00:18:15,234
Whoa.

00:18:16,735 --> 00:18:17,569
Who are you, pal?

00:18:17,636 --> 00:18:19,571
I'm Trent Calloway.
Who are you?

00:18:19,638 --> 00:18:22,207
I'm Jim Brass.
Homicide.

00:18:22,274 --> 00:18:24,176
This is Gil Grissom.

00:18:24,243 --> 00:18:25,778
Crime Lab.

00:18:25,844 --> 00:18:27,179
Does a Victor
DaSilva live here?

00:18:27,246 --> 00:18:28,714
Yeah, but he's out.

00:18:28,781 --> 00:18:30,949
And you're in.
I'm painting the house.

00:18:31,016 --> 00:18:33,185
In the middle
of the night?

00:18:34,253 --> 00:18:35,387
Back up, Slick.

00:18:35,454 --> 00:18:37,089
We got some questions.

00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:41,994
GRISSOM:
So when was the last time
you saw Victor DaSilva?

00:18:42,061 --> 00:18:44,330
A day or two ago.

00:18:46,231 --> 00:18:49,368
This whole painting thing
had him stressed out.

00:18:51,136 --> 00:18:55,074
"Picking up airheads
just got easier."

00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,542
Yeah, he worked
freelance, mostly.

00:18:56,608 --> 00:18:57,943
He won a "Bandy" award
for that one.

00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:58,944
He worked for
an ad agency.

00:18:59,011 --> 00:19:00,746
What else did he do
for a living?

00:19:00,813 --> 00:19:02,181
That's it,
as far as I know.

00:19:02,247 --> 00:19:03,182
What about you?

00:19:03,248 --> 00:19:06,418
I mean, besides painting walls.

00:19:06,485 --> 00:19:08,253
I'm a bouncer
at the French Palace.

00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,456
I throw guys like you out.

00:19:10,522 --> 00:19:11,690
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:19:11,757 --> 00:19:13,325
Yeah.

00:19:13,392 --> 00:19:14,893
You know,
you don't seem too shook up

00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,095
about DaSilva's death.

00:19:16,161 --> 00:19:17,129
We weren't that close.

00:19:17,196 --> 00:19:18,931
We had some mutual friends,
he needed someone

00:19:18,998 --> 00:19:20,065
to help him with this place

00:19:20,132 --> 00:19:22,368
and, uh, I never
turn down a job.

00:19:22,434 --> 00:19:25,804
Well, I hope you
get paid in advance.

00:20:08,781 --> 00:20:10,582
Found a picture
of Victor DaSilva

00:20:10,649 --> 00:20:13,018
and, uh... somebody.

00:20:13,085 --> 00:20:14,286
What does that mean?

00:20:14,353 --> 00:20:16,088
Cut out.

00:20:20,626 --> 00:20:22,027
So bizarre, human behavior.

00:20:22,094 --> 00:20:23,896
What you can't
cut out of your mind

00:20:23,962 --> 00:20:26,231
you can always cut out
of your photo album.

00:20:26,298 --> 00:20:28,133
Why are we in the closet?

00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,136
I got a call from Greg Sanders,
at our lab.

00:20:31,203 --> 00:20:33,839
He found peanut shells
on the foot pedals

00:20:33,906 --> 00:20:35,107
of Victor DaSilva's car.

00:20:35,174 --> 00:20:37,009
Hmm.

00:20:41,847 --> 00:20:44,416
And voila.

00:20:44,483 --> 00:20:47,186
Mr. Calloway, would you mind
coming in here, please?

00:20:48,754 --> 00:20:51,457
Mr. Calloway...

00:20:51,523 --> 00:20:54,960
is there a remote possibility
that Victor DaSilva ever worked

00:20:55,027 --> 00:20:56,929
at a concession stand
of some sort

00:20:56,996 --> 00:20:59,765
like at a ballpark or...

00:20:59,832 --> 00:21:02,501
the Secret Garden
of Siegfried and Roy

00:21:02,568 --> 00:21:04,236
in the elephants' habitat?

00:21:04,303 --> 00:21:06,138
I don't think
it's Victor's style.

00:21:06,205 --> 00:21:08,574
This is ridiculous.

00:21:08,641 --> 00:21:12,144
Well, not according
to his size 11s.

00:21:19,852 --> 00:21:21,487
Telling you...

00:21:21,553 --> 00:21:24,390
the kids in here
got nothing but time.

00:21:24,456 --> 00:21:27,059
You'd be surprised
what they can come up with.

00:21:27,126 --> 00:21:28,661
WARRICK:
Nothing surprises me anymore.

00:21:28,727 --> 00:21:31,230
Yeah? Wait awhile.

00:21:31,296 --> 00:21:33,399
This is the main
thoroughfare for
all the toilets.

00:21:33,465 --> 00:21:38,137
All the goods
come through here.

00:21:38,203 --> 00:21:42,708
You know, it's funny,
I wanted to be a surgeon.

00:21:42,775 --> 00:21:44,043
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:21:44,109 --> 00:21:45,811
Step back for Molly.

00:21:54,453 --> 00:21:56,455
Step back for Warrick.

00:22:00,793 --> 00:22:03,529
Whew!

00:22:08,801 --> 00:22:09,902
( <i>groans</i> )

00:22:10,903 --> 00:22:12,838
Whew!

00:22:12,905 --> 00:22:15,541
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:22:18,677 --> 00:22:21,213
Man...

00:22:29,154 --> 00:22:32,424
Impressive.

00:22:35,494 --> 00:22:37,696
ROBBINS:
Well, Dr. Miller...

00:22:37,763 --> 00:22:40,766
just what exactly are
we looking at here?

00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:47,239
The specimen's pelvic girdle
and spine...

00:22:47,306 --> 00:22:49,608
are curved
and upright

00:22:49,675 --> 00:22:51,977
suggesting the species
may be quadrupedal.

00:22:52,044 --> 00:22:54,146
The left
and right femur

00:22:54,213 --> 00:22:57,049
and humerus are derivative
of the <i>Tarsius.</i>

00:22:59,551 --> 00:23:00,486
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:23:00,552 --> 00:23:02,521
I think I know what this is.

00:23:04,356 --> 00:23:07,760
The preliminary evaluation
is correct, Dr. Robbins.

00:23:09,628 --> 00:23:11,563
It's not human, it's a primate.

00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:14,299
More specifically, a gorilla.

00:23:25,144 --> 00:23:28,180
NARRATOR ( <i>on computer):</i>
Bushmeat Hunters thrive

00:23:28,247 --> 00:23:30,749
on the murdering of gorillas
for profit.

00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:32,051
In the United States

00:23:32,117 --> 00:23:34,320
their meat is considered
a delicacy.

00:23:34,386 --> 00:23:36,622
It is said if the animal
is ingested

00:23:36,689 --> 00:23:39,958
its great powers will be
passed on to the consumer.

00:23:43,562 --> 00:23:45,164
What are you doing?

00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:46,332
Working the case.

00:23:46,398 --> 00:23:48,334
What case?

00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,702
The skinned gorilla--
torso...

00:23:49,768 --> 00:23:50,936
40 miles outside of Baker.

00:23:51,003 --> 00:23:52,004
Remember?

00:23:52,071 --> 00:23:54,340
I don't think that is a case.

00:23:54,406 --> 00:23:56,508
Well, it was
at the start of shift.

00:23:56,575 --> 00:23:58,010
A crime has
been committed.

00:23:58,077 --> 00:24:01,013
I hate to be the one
to state the obvious, but, uh...

00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,882
this isn't a human being
we're dealing with--

00:24:03,949 --> 00:24:05,017
it's an animal.

00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:08,520
And...

00:24:08,587 --> 00:24:10,823
And every time
a dog gets run over

00:24:10,889 --> 00:24:13,425
you can't go to the vet
to examine it.

00:24:13,492 --> 00:24:14,426
( <i>chortles</i> )

00:24:14,493 --> 00:24:15,594
I can't believe you.

00:24:16,762 --> 00:24:18,397
You, with your pet tarantula

00:24:18,464 --> 00:24:21,667
your maggot farms, that
Komodo dragon on back order...

00:24:21,734 --> 00:24:23,068
You should be

00:24:23,135 --> 00:24:25,838
more sympathetic
to the senseless murder

00:24:25,904 --> 00:24:27,506
of an innocent gorilla.

00:24:27,573 --> 00:24:29,308
You're right.

00:24:29,375 --> 00:24:31,010
I apologize.

00:24:31,076 --> 00:24:32,911
I was just checking

00:24:32,978 --> 00:24:34,446
to see where <i>your</i> head was at.

00:24:34,513 --> 00:24:36,015
For now,
you're working alone.

00:24:36,081 --> 00:24:37,916
Catherine needed Nick.

00:24:37,983 --> 00:24:39,451
Bummer.

00:24:39,518 --> 00:24:40,619
We got another dead body call.

00:24:40,686 --> 00:24:42,254
Wait. Is he missing a head?

00:24:42,321 --> 00:24:43,756
Maybe.

00:24:43,822 --> 00:24:47,559
Meantime, you're on standby
in case Nick needs backup.

00:24:48,994 --> 00:24:50,763
Your evaluation form.

00:24:50,829 --> 00:24:53,832
"Overall performance:
Outstanding."

00:24:55,267 --> 00:24:57,936
"Ability to prioritize:
Improvement needed."

00:24:59,872 --> 00:25:01,373
You up for a riddle?

00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,975
Sure. Why not?

00:25:03,042 --> 00:25:04,576
Okay, repeat after me:

00:25:04,643 --> 00:25:05,844
Silk, silk, silk.

00:25:05,911 --> 00:25:07,680
Silk, silk, silk.

00:25:07,746 --> 00:25:09,682
What do cows drink?

00:25:09,748 --> 00:25:12,184
Water. Why?

00:25:12,251 --> 00:25:13,452
Never mind.

00:25:14,887 --> 00:25:17,990
Who thought that a toothbrush
could take a kid's life?

00:25:18,057 --> 00:25:20,159
Well, the son of a bitch was
crafty, I'll give him that.

00:25:20,225 --> 00:25:22,461
Melted the end of the toothbrush
to insert the razor blade.

00:25:22,528 --> 00:25:23,495
Then why the rubber band?

00:25:26,865 --> 00:25:27,933
Concealment.

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,068
Oh, that's deep.

00:25:29,134 --> 00:25:31,070
Yeah. Now all I got to do

00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:34,006
is put this shank
in someone's hand.

00:25:49,855 --> 00:25:51,890
Hey...

00:25:51,957 --> 00:25:53,359
here's something new.

00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:00,666
The cousin
of footprints.

00:26:02,434 --> 00:26:03,702
Sock prints... look.

00:26:03,769 --> 00:26:05,170
That's not from a shoe.

00:26:05,237 --> 00:26:07,139
Look at
the fabric impressions.

00:26:07,206 --> 00:26:09,475
The guy ran out of here
in his socks.

00:26:09,541 --> 00:26:10,576
Mm-hmm.

00:26:10,643 --> 00:26:13,345
Perp thought he could
cover his tracks

00:26:13,412 --> 00:26:15,180
by taking off
his shoes.

00:26:15,247 --> 00:26:16,415
He thought wrong.

00:26:20,886 --> 00:26:24,623
Manager spotted the blood
during a night sweep.

00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:28,193
Want to know who the
shed was registered to?

00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,628
Victor DaSilva.

00:26:29,695 --> 00:26:31,630
Our head.

00:26:31,697 --> 00:26:32,665
Oh...

00:26:32,731 --> 00:26:34,800
So this is the
rest of his body?

00:26:34,867 --> 00:26:37,202
It ain't gorilla.

00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:39,605
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:26:42,041 --> 00:26:43,509
Well, this amount of blood

00:26:43,575 --> 00:26:45,911
suggests that the victim
was killed here.

00:26:45,978 --> 00:26:47,713
Why don't I do the one-to-ones

00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,882
and you start looking
for the weapon?

00:26:49,948 --> 00:26:52,484
Yeah, whatever punctures,
whatever chops.

00:27:29,188 --> 00:27:31,557
Bob Villa.

00:27:31,623 --> 00:27:34,760
Paul Bunyan.

00:27:34,827 --> 00:27:39,832
WILLOWS:
By the way, what
about my evaluation?

00:27:39,898 --> 00:27:43,535
Keep up the good work,
Catherine.

00:27:43,602 --> 00:27:44,970
Are those molds

00:27:45,037 --> 00:27:45,938
dry yet?

00:27:47,773 --> 00:27:49,108
They're tacky.

00:27:52,378 --> 00:27:54,580
Hmm, positive to positive.

00:27:54,647 --> 00:27:56,315
That'll never hold up in court,
though.

00:27:56,382 --> 00:27:58,283
We're going to need
to make negative molds.

00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:00,352
Tabling the ax.

00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:02,121
Hammer time.

00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:06,992
Um...

00:28:07,059 --> 00:28:08,594
Pretty close.

00:28:08,661 --> 00:28:10,095
All right,
I fed the measurements

00:28:10,162 --> 00:28:11,697
from the claw end of the hammer.

00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:27,646
Something doesn't seem right
about this.

00:28:31,817 --> 00:28:34,720
Why would you use the claw end
of the hammer to kill him

00:28:34,787 --> 00:28:36,055
and not the hammer end?

00:28:42,328 --> 00:28:43,462
Wait a minute.

00:28:43,529 --> 00:28:46,365
Maybe it wasn't about
hitting him in the head.

00:28:46,432 --> 00:28:48,300
Maybe it was about

00:28:48,367 --> 00:28:50,936
fitting him in the locker.

00:29:06,118 --> 00:29:08,787
So, the footlocker
had no head room.

00:29:08,854 --> 00:29:10,656
Exactly.

00:29:18,364 --> 00:29:19,631
So, uh, tricky Nick

00:29:19,698 --> 00:29:22,134
what did you get
on your evaluation?

00:29:22,201 --> 00:29:23,168
It's private.

00:29:23,235 --> 00:29:25,371
Yeah, but how many
"outstandings"

00:29:25,437 --> 00:29:26,405
did Grissom give you?

00:29:26,472 --> 00:29:27,973
Enough.

00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,842
DaSilva had a nice pad.

00:29:29,908 --> 00:29:32,411
What did he tell
you to look for?

00:29:32,478 --> 00:29:34,847
Grissom didn't
tell me anything.

00:29:34,913 --> 00:29:37,383
I put this together myself.

00:29:39,385 --> 00:29:41,854
Give me some light here,
will you, partner?

00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,888
Yeah.

00:29:42,955 --> 00:29:45,024
All right,
it's like this:

00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:49,361
sock prints were found
at the crime scene, size 11.

00:29:49,428 --> 00:29:53,499
Shoes Grissom took from
the closet here, size 11.

00:29:53,565 --> 00:29:55,668
DaSilva's shoe size: Ten.

00:29:55,734 --> 00:29:57,536
So whose
size 11's were they?

00:29:57,603 --> 00:29:59,705
Grissom is something.

00:29:59,772 --> 00:30:02,374
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:33,605

"Spur's Corral."

00:30:33,672 --> 00:30:35,407
I know that place.

00:30:35,474 --> 00:30:37,643
They give you
peanuts for starters

00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:40,012
instead of bread
or chips and salsa.

00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:41,347
I'm calling Grissom.

00:30:41,413 --> 00:30:43,916
Look, you obviously
don't need my help.

00:30:43,983 --> 00:30:46,085
I-I got go put
something to rest.

00:30:46,151 --> 00:30:47,086
See you later?

00:30:47,152 --> 00:30:48,354
All right, thanks.

00:30:49,488 --> 00:30:51,557
GRISSOM:
The body from the storage shed--

00:30:51,623 --> 00:30:53,258
it's Victor DaSilva, all right.

00:30:53,325 --> 00:30:54,460
We ran his prints.

00:30:54,526 --> 00:30:56,295
It's nice that he
still had his hands.

00:30:56,362 --> 00:30:57,963
I was wrong about the cause
of death.

00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:59,765
The hammer didn't do it?

00:30:59,832 --> 00:31:01,700
No. He was shot point blank
in the heart.

00:31:01,767 --> 00:31:03,068
.380.

00:31:03,135 --> 00:31:04,403
Imagine the
human heart

00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:05,304
as an apple.

00:31:08,841 --> 00:31:10,809
<i>Instant liquefaction.</i>

00:31:10,876 --> 00:31:12,711
We found everything else
in that shed;

00:31:12,778 --> 00:31:14,279
I don't know why
we didn't find a gun.

00:31:14,346 --> 00:31:16,315
Well, maybe he was shot
somewhere else?

00:31:16,382 --> 00:31:18,550
That would explain the plastic.

00:31:18,617 --> 00:31:20,586
What plastic?

00:31:20,653 --> 00:31:23,455
You never told me
about any plastic.

00:31:23,522 --> 00:31:24,523
I didn't?

00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:26,492
Oh.

00:31:26,558 --> 00:31:28,761
The victim was wrapped
in a plastic sheet.

00:31:28,827 --> 00:31:31,597
Victor DaSilva's
entire house was
covered in plastic.

00:31:31,664 --> 00:31:32,931
He was having
it painted.

00:31:32,998 --> 00:31:34,933
Really?
Who's the painter?

00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,535
Nobody famous.

00:31:36,602 --> 00:31:37,970
Yet.

00:31:43,307 --> 00:31:45,476
You had access
to Victor DaSilva's house?

00:31:45,543 --> 00:31:47,812
Yeah, I was painting it.
You own a gun?

00:31:47,878 --> 00:31:49,280
I don't mean a paint gun.

00:31:49,347 --> 00:31:50,748
No.
WILLOWS:
Let's get to it.

00:31:50,815 --> 00:31:51,949
What's your shoe size?

00:31:52,016 --> 00:31:52,984
Why?

00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:54,785
I have a shoe fetish.

00:31:54,852 --> 00:31:55,820
I love feet.

00:31:55,886 --> 00:31:58,089
It's 13.

00:31:58,155 --> 00:31:59,457
Take off your shoes and socks.

00:31:59,523 --> 00:32:01,092
We need to verify.

00:32:10,301 --> 00:32:12,403
Okay...

00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:13,771
step on the paper.

00:32:27,985 --> 00:32:30,621
Two sizes too big.

00:32:34,158 --> 00:32:36,761
I'd tell you not to
step on the evidence,
but, uh...

00:32:36,827 --> 00:32:38,162
Yeah, but what's
the point?

00:32:38,229 --> 00:32:40,431
Pretty good gimmick
they got here, though.

00:32:40,498 --> 00:32:42,967
You eat peanuts,
toss the shells
on the floor--

00:32:43,034 --> 00:32:44,435
nobody gives a rat's ass.

00:32:50,441 --> 00:32:52,443
No, Victor DaSilva
never worked here.

00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:54,946
We found one of your
uniforms in his closet.

00:32:55,012 --> 00:32:56,447
Any idea how it got there?

00:32:57,381 --> 00:33:00,985
Guys-- look, boss, I'm sorry.

00:33:01,052 --> 00:33:02,987
I thought I was on
to something here.

00:33:03,054 --> 00:33:04,555
I had a conflict in shoe sizes.

00:33:04,622 --> 00:33:06,157
So, I thought I'd play a hunch.

00:33:06,223 --> 00:33:07,224
Sara was right there.

00:33:07,291 --> 00:33:08,626
We checked out the shoes...

00:33:08,693 --> 00:33:13,531
( <i>Nick continues talking</i>
<i>in background</i> )

00:33:13,598 --> 00:33:17,068
...so that's why I
buzzed you guys down.

00:33:17,134 --> 00:33:20,471
You got to follow your hunches,
right?

00:33:20,538 --> 00:33:22,707
Yeah, sure.

00:33:22,773 --> 00:33:24,775
Tim? You still
got that picture

00:33:24,842 --> 00:33:26,377
that you took
from DaSilva's house?

00:33:26,444 --> 00:33:27,445
Yeah.

00:33:27,511 --> 00:33:29,146
Yeah, here it is.

00:33:41,125 --> 00:33:42,393
What? You're looking

00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,461
at the sombrero?

00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:47,298
The earrings.

00:33:47,365 --> 00:33:49,200
Victor DaSilva was here

00:33:49,267 --> 00:33:50,968
with someone
he cut out of his life.

00:33:51,035 --> 00:33:52,069
Probably his girlfriend.

00:33:52,136 --> 00:33:52,903
Excuse me.

00:33:54,772 --> 00:33:58,409
You recognize this ear?

00:33:58,476 --> 00:34:00,378
You got to be kidding me.

00:34:01,913 --> 00:34:03,347
Wait a minute.

00:34:03,414 --> 00:34:04,548
Yeah, I do.

00:34:04,615 --> 00:34:07,818
I do recognize those earrings.

00:34:07,885 --> 00:34:11,522
GRISSOM:
Fred Applewhite?

00:34:11,589 --> 00:34:13,824
You all here for lunch?

00:34:13,891 --> 00:34:15,927
No.
Take out.

00:34:17,328 --> 00:34:20,097
I heard you were disassembling
the gorilla.

00:34:20,164 --> 00:34:21,999
For purposes of disease control.

00:34:22,066 --> 00:34:23,935
Per the CDC,
I have to take samples

00:34:24,001 --> 00:34:26,203
and dispose of this animal
immediately.

00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:29,273
Well, I've been trying to find
out who did this to her

00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:31,108
and, um, I have some questions.

00:34:31,175 --> 00:34:34,045
You ask, I'll answer.

00:34:34,111 --> 00:34:35,479
Why amputate the gorilla's head?

00:34:35,546 --> 00:34:36,581
It's a trophy.

00:34:36,647 --> 00:34:39,216
American fetishers
would pay up to $10,000

00:34:39,283 --> 00:34:40,551
for the head
of a Low Land Gorilla.

00:34:40,618 --> 00:34:41,886
The hands and feet?

00:34:41,953 --> 00:34:42,920
Novelty items.

00:34:42,987 --> 00:34:44,555
Sold as ashtrays.

00:34:44,622 --> 00:34:48,759
Here Nick and I were thinking
it was to avoid I.D.

00:34:48,826 --> 00:34:51,729
Why skin it?

00:34:51,796 --> 00:34:56,367
Purses, shoes, boots...
it's sad.

00:34:56,434 --> 00:34:57,635
Genetically

00:34:57,702 --> 00:35:00,204
we're 92.7% identical
with gorillas.

00:35:00,271 --> 00:35:02,373
It's hard to tell
where the human ends

00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,708
and the animal begins.

00:35:03,774 --> 00:35:04,709
Well said.

00:35:04,775 --> 00:35:07,311
I checked out
a couple of websites...

00:35:07,378 --> 00:35:09,213
Bushmeat.net, Gorilla.org.

00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,748
I think she
was killed

00:35:10,815 --> 00:35:12,817
probably in
Cameroon or Congo

00:35:12,883 --> 00:35:15,586
transported
to the Port of Los Angeles.

00:35:15,653 --> 00:35:17,355
Dismembered, packaged...

00:35:17,421 --> 00:35:18,589
<i>loaded onto a small plane.</i>

00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:23,494
<i>En route, they dumped</i>
<i>what they couldn't sell</i>

00:35:23,561 --> 00:35:25,329
but, uh, I just have to find
the plane.

00:35:25,396 --> 00:35:26,831
Needle in a haystack.

00:35:26,897 --> 00:35:28,599
Chances are,
whoever did this

00:35:28,666 --> 00:35:29,734
are halfway

00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,103
around the world
by now.

00:35:32,169 --> 00:35:33,638
There must be something
I can do.

00:35:33,704 --> 00:35:36,107
Actually, there is.

00:36:03,768 --> 00:36:06,037
For everyone that parts

00:36:06,103 --> 00:36:07,939
one stands above ground.

00:36:17,748 --> 00:36:20,217
Okay, Mr. Applewhite...

00:36:20,284 --> 00:36:21,419
take a walk.

00:36:31,462 --> 00:36:33,631
Okay, great.

00:36:33,698 --> 00:36:35,166
Now, Mr. Applewhite...

00:36:35,232 --> 00:36:38,569
this time, I want you
to do something different.

00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:40,638
This time...

00:36:40,705 --> 00:36:42,373
run.

00:36:47,678 --> 00:36:51,249
GRISSOM:
<i>Footprints are</i>
<i>almost as reliable</i>

00:36:51,315 --> 00:36:52,250
as fingerprints

00:36:52,316 --> 00:36:53,918
and every step
tells a story.

00:36:53,985 --> 00:36:55,920
The first few steps,
you were walking.

00:36:55,987 --> 00:36:59,924
See the complete heel, arch
and five little piggies?

00:36:59,991 --> 00:37:02,593
The next few
steps, however...

00:37:04,462 --> 00:37:06,430
the heel disappears.

00:37:06,497 --> 00:37:08,599
All of the
pressure was put

00:37:08,666 --> 00:37:10,901
on ball of the foot
and toes. Why?

00:37:10,968 --> 00:37:12,169
'Cause you were running...

00:37:12,236 --> 00:37:13,738
and my guess is
that on the day

00:37:13,804 --> 00:37:15,606
you had a head
in your hand.

00:37:15,673 --> 00:37:17,875
STOKES:
You see,
everyone's foot makes

00:37:17,942 --> 00:37:19,243
a unique well impression.

00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:20,244
Check it out.

00:37:20,311 --> 00:37:21,345
The, uh

00:37:21,412 --> 00:37:24,515
width...
the ball of the foot...

00:37:24,582 --> 00:37:27,385
instep... arch...
and, uh...

00:37:28,352 --> 00:37:30,621
size 11 for dessert.

00:37:30,688 --> 00:37:32,290
GRISSOM:
Mr. Applewhite

00:37:32,356 --> 00:37:35,593
your footprints... place
you at the crime scene.

00:37:37,261 --> 00:37:38,829
Victor and I were partners.

00:37:38,896 --> 00:37:40,064
We shared everything

00:37:40,131 --> 00:37:42,900
including in our house
and in the storage shed.

00:37:42,967 --> 00:37:44,802
We know that. When
did you move out?

00:37:44,869 --> 00:37:46,337
Three months ago.

00:37:46,404 --> 00:37:48,639
He found somebody else...

00:37:48,706 --> 00:37:49,941
kicked me out.

00:37:50,007 --> 00:37:52,476
And you took all your
possessions with you?

00:37:52,543 --> 00:37:55,613
Not everything.
So, you were hoping
for a reconciliation.

00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,948
Yeah.

00:37:57,014 --> 00:38:00,818
I thought once Victor got
this new guy out of his system

00:38:00,885 --> 00:38:02,053
he'd come around.

00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:03,588
But he didn't, did he?

00:38:03,654 --> 00:38:06,557
That's why you went to
his house last night.

00:38:06,624 --> 00:38:07,825
Who said I went there?

00:38:07,892 --> 00:38:09,760
The plastic--

00:38:09,827 --> 00:38:11,829
you know...

00:38:11,896 --> 00:38:14,799
the plastic that you lay down
when you paint a house...

00:38:14,865 --> 00:38:18,402
the kind of plastic
that you, uh...

00:38:18,469 --> 00:38:19,804
wrap a dead body in...

00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:21,138
the plastic

00:38:21,205 --> 00:38:23,674
that we
found your fingerprints on.

00:38:29,046 --> 00:38:31,983
Let me tell you what
I think happened.

00:38:32,049 --> 00:38:33,317
Take what you want.

00:38:33,384 --> 00:38:34,819
I don't care.

00:38:34,885 --> 00:38:36,654
I've moved on.

00:38:36,721 --> 00:38:39,957
What do you think
you're going to do,
just paint me

00:38:40,024 --> 00:38:42,827
out of your life?
Just take what you want
and get out.

00:38:42,893 --> 00:38:44,996
I'll tell you what I want.

00:39:18,396 --> 00:39:19,830
Damn it!

00:39:19,897 --> 00:39:21,232
God!

00:39:22,366 --> 00:39:24,168
So, what did you forget?

00:39:26,837 --> 00:39:31,309
You wouldn't believe it,
but I forgot to lock the shed.

00:39:31,375 --> 00:39:33,744
BRASS:
And when you came
back out

00:39:33,811 --> 00:39:35,046
your car was gone.

00:39:35,112 --> 00:39:37,381
Yeah.

00:39:37,448 --> 00:39:39,850
I don't know who took it.

00:39:39,917 --> 00:39:41,252
We do.

00:39:41,319 --> 00:39:43,220
Lori! Lori!

00:39:57,401 --> 00:39:59,337
You know,
that reminds me--

00:39:59,403 --> 00:40:02,340
I got to remember
to take Greg Sanders to lunch.

00:40:02,406 --> 00:40:05,710
He did a nice job
sniffing out those peanuts.

00:40:05,776 --> 00:40:07,778
Yeah, he did.

00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:18,222
We were waiting for you.

00:40:18,289 --> 00:40:19,357
Meet Ronnie Connors.

00:40:19,423 --> 00:40:20,591
Where's his attorney?

00:40:20,658 --> 00:40:23,527
What are you talking to
him about my business?

00:40:23,594 --> 00:40:24,595
Ask me.

00:40:26,864 --> 00:40:28,633
Where's your lawyer?

00:40:28,699 --> 00:40:30,601
Ask him.

00:40:42,346 --> 00:40:43,447
How's your plaque?

00:40:43,514 --> 00:40:45,483
My what?

00:40:45,549 --> 00:40:46,817
Your teeth.

00:40:46,884 --> 00:40:49,987
I mean, how many toothbrushes
does a guy need?

00:40:51,956 --> 00:40:53,090
Apparently, for you

00:40:53,157 --> 00:40:56,327
it's as many as it takes
to make the perfect shank.

00:40:56,394 --> 00:40:58,396
Let me tell you
something, breeze.

00:40:58,462 --> 00:41:02,199
I'm LA County/Slauson
payback Crip, cuz.

00:41:02,266 --> 00:41:05,736
I got a lot of
offspring up in here--

00:41:05,803 --> 00:41:07,305
black as night.

00:41:07,371 --> 00:41:10,741
They answer to me
because <i>I'm</i> the macaroni.

00:41:10,808 --> 00:41:13,010
I mean, seriously...

00:41:13,077 --> 00:41:16,314
you have any idea who
you're talking to?

00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:18,482
Yeah.

00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:30,494
So, why don't I
have to testify?

00:41:30,561 --> 00:41:33,331
The evidence will testify
for you.

00:41:33,397 --> 00:41:35,900
Ronnie Connors...
bought a toothbrush

00:41:35,967 --> 00:41:38,736
and some rubber bands
at the commissary.

00:41:38,803 --> 00:41:39,971
He didn't know it

00:41:40,037 --> 00:41:42,707
but that's the last shank
he'll ever make.

00:41:42,773 --> 00:41:44,542
How'd you know
it was RC's?

00:41:44,609 --> 00:41:46,210
Before he made
the shank

00:41:46,277 --> 00:41:48,579
he shaved
with the same razor.

00:41:48,646 --> 00:41:51,048
His DNA was
all over the blade.

00:41:51,115 --> 00:41:52,483
Oh, God.

00:41:58,556 --> 00:42:00,958
I owe you, man.

00:42:01,025 --> 00:42:04,061
It's not me
you have to thank.

00:42:22,446 --> 00:42:24,582
I love you, Grandpa.

00:42:30,488 --> 00:42:32,290
You're all I got, James.

00:42:34,125 --> 00:42:35,927
You're everything
to me, you hear?

00:43:04,055 --> 00:43:06,657
I thought you said we
were grabbing a beer.

00:43:06,724 --> 00:43:08,726
We are, after this.

00:43:08,793 --> 00:43:11,228
Aw, Grissom, you know,
this is your thing.
Ah-ah-ah.

00:43:11,295 --> 00:43:13,264
Every nine years
and 34 days

00:43:13,331 --> 00:43:15,132
I feel like sharing.

00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:16,534
You'll like it.

00:43:16,601 --> 00:43:18,135
It cleanses you.

00:43:20,905 --> 00:43:23,407
Cleanses me?

00:43:23,474 --> 00:43:25,042
Whatever happened

00:43:25,109 --> 00:43:26,377
to my evaluation?

00:43:26,444 --> 00:43:28,079
You're sitting in it.

00:43:28,145 --> 00:43:31,315
♪ ...speak for you
when you're gone ♪

00:43:35,886 --> 00:43:41,626
