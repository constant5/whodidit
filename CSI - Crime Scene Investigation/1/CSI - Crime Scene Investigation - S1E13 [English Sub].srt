00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:14,819
Good afternoon, Mr. McGrath.

00:00:14,819 --> 00:00:15,953
How’s the golf?

00:00:20,658 --> 00:00:22,259
Hi.

00:00:22,259 --> 00:00:23,695
You look lost.

00:00:23,695 --> 00:00:25,830
Okay, the stairs are all
the way back to the left

00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:28,333
and the real estate office
is at the end of the hall.

00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:30,134
Okay? Bye.

00:00:30,134 --> 00:00:32,236
Ooh, are those for me?

00:00:32,236 --> 00:00:33,705
Hi, Dominic, sign here.

00:00:33,705 --> 00:00:34,706
Okay.

00:00:34,706 --> 00:00:35,873
I tell you, though

00:00:35,873 --> 00:00:37,875
this is going to be worth
a lot of money someday.

00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:39,277
I know, Elvis.

00:00:39,277 --> 00:00:40,312
Okay.

00:00:40,312 --> 00:00:41,746
See you.
Okay, bye-bye.

00:00:41,746 --> 00:00:42,847
( <i>groans</i> )

00:00:42,847 --> 00:00:44,716
Domino, it’s your turn
to pick up dinner.

00:00:44,716 --> 00:00:45,783
Okay, Jake-o.

00:00:45,783 --> 00:00:47,452
Listen, uh, this goes
to Cooley Real Estate.

00:00:47,452 --> 00:00:48,720
That’s on two,
all right?

00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,755
And the Fed Ex is running
a little bit late

00:00:50,755 --> 00:00:51,789
on the pick-up.

00:00:51,789 --> 00:00:52,724
I’ll be back in...

00:00:52,724 --> 00:00:54,526
hmm, about ten minutes,
all right?

00:00:54,526 --> 00:00:55,860
You got it.
All right,
buddy.

00:01:02,099 --> 00:01:03,768
( <i>ticking</i> )

00:01:15,547 --> 00:01:17,782
( <i>ticking continues</i> )

00:01:28,193 --> 00:01:29,894
( <i>yells</i> )

00:01:34,933 --> 00:01:38,403
Oh, these fire guys
really know how to
trash a crime scene.

00:01:38,403 --> 00:01:39,804
That’s what they do.

00:01:39,804 --> 00:01:42,107
Put wet stuff on
the red stuff.

00:01:42,107 --> 00:01:45,143
We’re all clear to go in,
but here’s what we’ve got.

00:01:45,143 --> 00:01:46,344
Couple of head wounds.

00:01:46,344 --> 00:01:48,013
Elderly guy had his arm
torn off.

00:01:48,013 --> 00:01:50,748
The only fatality so
far is Jake Richards,
a security guard.

00:01:50,748 --> 00:01:53,718
Body’s still inside.

00:02:02,327 --> 00:02:03,962
BRASS:
How big you think this bomb was?

00:02:03,962 --> 00:02:05,898
WILLOWS:
It’s not the size of the bomb.

00:02:05,898 --> 00:02:08,033
It’s the overpressure
in the air around it.

00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,019
The Van Gogh effect.

00:02:28,286 --> 00:02:29,321
In stereo.

00:02:29,321 --> 00:02:31,456
Both ears gone.

00:02:31,456 --> 00:02:33,325
A perfectly symmetrical
amputation.

00:02:33,325 --> 00:02:36,361
Means he was looking directly
at the bomb when it went off.

00:02:36,361 --> 00:02:37,796
So either it drew
his attention

00:02:37,796 --> 00:02:40,032
or it was contained
in something

00:02:40,032 --> 00:02:41,466
that seemed benign.

00:02:43,235 --> 00:02:45,337
Smell the sulfur?

00:02:45,337 --> 00:02:47,439
Uh-huh.

00:02:50,075 --> 00:02:51,977
Got your lighter, Jim?

00:02:51,977 --> 00:02:53,646
Sure.

00:02:58,283 --> 00:02:59,918
Light this.

00:03:02,154 --> 00:03:04,657
Gunpowder.

00:03:04,657 --> 00:03:06,825
GRISSOM:
Well, we know the propellant.

00:03:06,825 --> 00:03:09,161
So would you care to make
a preliminary call on this?

00:03:09,161 --> 00:03:10,563
I’d love to.

00:03:12,631 --> 00:03:14,967
Seat of the bomb is here.

00:03:14,967 --> 00:03:17,870
Victim was thrown...

00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,137
three meters.

00:03:19,137 --> 00:03:20,406
His clothes are torn

00:03:20,406 --> 00:03:22,375
but not burnt,
indicating

00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:24,109
a low-velocity propellant.

00:03:24,109 --> 00:03:25,978
6,000-7,000 feet per second.

00:03:25,978 --> 00:03:28,146
Who? Why?

00:03:28,146 --> 00:03:31,049
Will he do it again?

00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:33,386
Time will tell.

The dirty little secret of bombs

00:04:17,163 --> 00:04:19,065
is how easy they are to make

00:04:19,065 --> 00:04:20,967
and use.

00:04:20,967 --> 00:04:23,136
Our murder weapon’s
here someplace

00:04:23,136 --> 00:04:24,570
in a thousand pieces.

00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:26,339
We have to find it
and put it back together again.

00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:27,373
Where do we start?

00:04:27,373 --> 00:04:28,474
If it’s not growing

00:04:28,474 --> 00:04:29,542
pick it up.

00:04:29,542 --> 00:04:30,877
We cart everything we find

00:04:30,877 --> 00:04:32,979
back to the lab.
And then what?

00:04:32,979 --> 00:04:35,214
Stay curious.

00:04:36,382 --> 00:04:38,384
Can you fill in the blanks?

00:04:38,384 --> 00:04:39,886
WILLOWS:
Bombs explode.

00:04:39,886 --> 00:04:42,521
Weird thing is their components
survive the explosion.

00:04:42,521 --> 00:04:43,957
If we can piece together
this bomb

00:04:43,957 --> 00:04:45,724
we’re closer to finding
who did this.

00:04:45,724 --> 00:04:48,061
So, Warrick, when
you’re photographing
this debris

00:04:48,061 --> 00:04:49,562
can you, uh...?

00:04:49,562 --> 00:04:52,098
Uh, I know,
looky-loos.

00:04:55,468 --> 00:04:58,071
( <i>indistinct chatter</i> )

00:05:38,277 --> 00:05:41,114
Come on, Nick, it’s my
last night in Sin City.

00:05:41,114 --> 00:05:42,248
One more drink, man.

00:05:42,248 --> 00:05:43,783
Oh, no, I just
pulled a double.

00:05:43,783 --> 00:05:45,519
And I still have to file
my shift report.

00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:47,421
Man, you’re
off the clock.

00:05:47,421 --> 00:05:50,557
You’d have never passed up
a wild night back at A&amp;M.

00:05:50,557 --> 00:05:52,091
Well, I guess I grew up.

00:05:52,091 --> 00:05:53,793
Too bad, check that out.

00:06:00,334 --> 00:06:01,801
Enjoy.

00:06:01,801 --> 00:06:03,737
You must really love
your job, man.

00:06:05,138 --> 00:06:06,640
Ladies...

00:06:14,381 --> 00:06:16,182
Here you go. Thanks, man.

00:06:16,182 --> 00:06:17,884
WOMAN:
Get your hands
off me!

00:06:17,884 --> 00:06:19,386
MAN:
Kristy, you’re not
going anywhere.

00:06:19,386 --> 00:06:21,421
You got that?

00:06:21,421 --> 00:06:23,190
Come on.
Relax a little bit.

00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:24,458
Settle down.

00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:26,293
Kristy? Kristy!
You don’t
own me, Jack.

00:06:26,293 --> 00:06:27,361
Nobody does.

00:06:27,361 --> 00:06:28,362
Hey.

00:06:28,362 --> 00:06:29,596
Back off.

00:06:29,596 --> 00:06:30,964
Hey, just mind
your own business.
Nick.

00:06:30,964 --> 00:06:32,599
I know him.
He’s a cop.

00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:34,468
A crime scene investigator.

00:06:34,468 --> 00:06:36,570
Nick, tell him
to leave me alone.

00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:37,737
Nobody tells me

00:06:37,737 --> 00:06:39,005
to do anything...

00:06:39,005 --> 00:06:40,374
Hey, are we going
to have a problem?

00:06:40,374 --> 00:06:45,079
No, officer, we’re not
going to have a problem.

00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:46,846
I’ll see you
around, baby.

00:06:55,555 --> 00:06:57,157
You okay?

00:06:57,157 --> 00:06:58,192
Yeah.

00:06:58,192 --> 00:07:00,127
Yeah, I’m fine.

00:07:00,127 --> 00:07:02,496
That was good
timing. Thanks.

00:07:02,496 --> 00:07:05,232
I suppose you need a ride.

00:07:05,232 --> 00:07:07,935
Do you mind?

00:07:07,935 --> 00:07:09,336
No.

00:07:09,336 --> 00:07:11,005
Come on.

00:07:11,005 --> 00:07:12,606
Thanks.

00:07:14,108 --> 00:07:16,877
WOMAN:
Seems like every time
we run into each other

00:07:16,877 --> 00:07:18,145
I’m getting into trouble.

00:07:18,145 --> 00:07:19,980
Not that it’s any
of my business

00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,782
but maybe you should think
about changing careers.

00:07:22,782 --> 00:07:25,585
Not every john
is like that guy.

00:07:25,585 --> 00:07:28,455
Besides, I’m
making a change.

00:07:28,455 --> 00:07:30,490
I’m going back
to school.

00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:32,259
Yeah?

00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:34,694
I’ve always wanted to study
communications.

00:07:34,694 --> 00:07:35,796
I’m good with people.

00:07:35,796 --> 00:07:38,698
That’s good.

00:07:38,698 --> 00:07:40,267
You think so?

00:07:40,267 --> 00:07:42,302
Yeah, I do.

00:07:42,302 --> 00:07:45,339
Well, I’m going
to go inside now.

00:07:47,641 --> 00:07:52,046
Unless, of course, you’d like
to come in for a drink.

00:07:52,046 --> 00:07:55,115
I don’t think
that’d be a good idea.

00:07:55,115 --> 00:07:56,383
Come on.

00:07:56,383 --> 00:07:58,052
Just ’cause you’re
a crime scene analyst

00:07:58,052 --> 00:08:00,220
you don’t have
to analyze everything.

00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,122
( <i>laughs</i> )

MAN:
Mr. Grissom.

00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:40,961
Oh, uh...

00:08:40,961 --> 00:08:42,463
Hi, I’ve...

00:08:42,463 --> 00:08:44,865
I’ve, um, I’ve seen you
on TV before.

00:08:44,865 --> 00:08:46,300
I admire your work.

00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,335
Well, thank you.

00:08:47,335 --> 00:08:48,436
And your name is...?

00:08:48,436 --> 00:08:49,870
Dominic.

00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:53,207
Uh, "i-c" rather than with
the "i-c-k"... uh, Kretzker.

00:08:53,207 --> 00:08:56,176
I’m the, uh, Hansen
Building Security Detail.

00:08:56,176 --> 00:08:58,713
Did somebody from Homicide
talk to you yet?

00:08:58,713 --> 00:09:00,047
Yeah, as a matter
of fact, they said

00:09:00,047 --> 00:09:01,449
that I was going
to be talking to you.

00:09:01,449 --> 00:09:02,983
Because, well, we are...

00:09:02,983 --> 00:09:04,652
you know, we’re both
in law enforcement, and...

00:09:04,652 --> 00:09:06,053
Right.

00:09:06,053 --> 00:09:07,455
Did you know the victim--

00:09:07,455 --> 00:09:09,190
the other security guard?

00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:11,125
Oh, yeah, he was one
of my best buddies.

00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:13,494
As a matter of fact, you know,
two minutes’ difference

00:09:13,494 --> 00:09:14,829
it would’ve been my face
all over the news

00:09:14,829 --> 00:09:16,864
instead of his, right?

00:09:16,864 --> 00:09:19,033
Would you, uh, like
to be on the news?

00:09:19,033 --> 00:09:19,834
Yeah.

00:09:19,834 --> 00:09:21,169
Yeah.

00:09:21,169 --> 00:09:23,070
I mean... only if I
could help people, yes.

00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:24,705
No, no.

00:09:24,705 --> 00:09:26,006
I know what you’re thinking.

00:09:26,006 --> 00:09:27,675
Uh, you know,
my building blows up

00:09:27,675 --> 00:09:30,411
I’m over at Arby’s sucking
down some extra sauce.

00:09:30,411 --> 00:09:32,147
You know, how could I want
to help people, right?

00:09:32,147 --> 00:09:34,815
Well, I mean, realistically,
what could you have done?

00:09:34,815 --> 00:09:36,784
Well, I know a lot about bombs.

00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:38,919
You know, pipe,
power, powder.

00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:41,556
The three "Ps"
of mass destruction.

00:09:41,556 --> 00:09:42,890
Huh.

00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:44,225
Dominic...

00:09:44,225 --> 00:09:45,926
with an "i-c,"
not "i-c-k"...
Yes sir?

00:09:45,926 --> 00:09:47,028
Would you be interested

00:09:47,028 --> 00:09:48,529
in helping me
in my investigation?

00:09:48,529 --> 00:09:51,232
Are you serious?

00:09:52,667 --> 00:09:54,835
Yeah, yes, sir.

00:09:54,835 --> 00:09:56,404
I’ll be honored, sir.

00:09:56,404 --> 00:09:58,173
Oh.

00:09:58,173 --> 00:10:00,475
But we can’t tell anybody
on the day shift, though

00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:02,677
because they’re going
to get real jealous.

00:10:02,677 --> 00:10:04,812
That’s good thinking.

00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:06,514
Would you excuse me
a minute?

00:10:06,514 --> 00:10:08,083
Yes.

00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:12,153
Keep an eye
on that guy.

00:10:13,855 --> 00:10:15,891
Oh, yes!

00:10:15,891 --> 00:10:18,159
Well, we got
a live one out there.

00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,361
I got a cop babysitting him.

00:10:20,361 --> 00:10:22,663
How are you doing?

00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:25,801
Well, are his
initials "FP"?

00:10:25,801 --> 00:10:29,004
No, Dominic
Kretzker, why?

00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:32,407
I found this near
the point of origin.

00:10:33,809 --> 00:10:35,844
Whoever did this

00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:37,245
is playing with us.

00:10:37,245 --> 00:10:39,280
Or he wants to get caught.

00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:47,088
Hey, it’s me.

00:10:47,088 --> 00:10:48,790
You in the shower?
What are you doing?

00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:51,292
Anyway, if you check
your messages

00:10:51,292 --> 00:10:52,694
I don’t have to work till later.

00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:54,295
So I thought since
you’re between careers

00:10:54,295 --> 00:10:56,965
you might want to grab a late...

00:10:56,965 --> 00:10:58,967
breakfast.

00:11:02,571 --> 00:11:04,472
Hey, Nick, what’s up?

00:11:04,472 --> 00:11:06,742
Not a lot.
What’s... what’s going on?

00:11:06,742 --> 00:11:07,943
It’s a 4-19.

00:11:07,943 --> 00:11:09,878
Dead prostitute.

00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:12,013
Who’s the decedent?

00:11:12,013 --> 00:11:14,015
Kristine Marie Hopkins.

00:11:14,015 --> 00:11:16,852
Day shift’s
got it covered.

00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:19,220
You all right?

00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,288
Yeah, I must’ve, uh...

00:11:20,288 --> 00:11:21,923
I must’ve got my wires crossed.

00:11:21,923 --> 00:11:22,924
I’ll see you.

00:11:22,924 --> 00:11:24,259
All right, man.

00:11:27,596 --> 00:11:31,367
All right, you cram this thing
here with gunpowder, all right?

00:11:31,367 --> 00:11:33,335
Then you cap it here,
and you cap it here.

00:11:33,335 --> 00:11:36,405
Now, the grains inside,
all right...

00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:39,508
they’re going to ignite
and they’re gonna
cause smoke.

00:11:39,508 --> 00:11:41,042
Lots and lots of smoke.

00:11:41,042 --> 00:11:42,511
Now, the problem is

00:11:42,511 --> 00:11:44,813
is all this smoke here, man,
it’s got nowhere to go.

00:11:44,813 --> 00:11:47,182
Okay, it starts
cooking, and then...

00:11:47,182 --> 00:11:49,318
Bob’s your uncle... Boom!

00:11:49,318 --> 00:11:52,087
Grissom was right:
you do know a lot about bombs.

00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:53,522
How’d you learn so much?

00:11:53,522 --> 00:11:55,324
Oh, they don’t teach
this stuff at universities.

00:11:55,324 --> 00:11:56,925
You know, this is all
trial and error.

00:11:56,925 --> 00:12:00,429
So what, you just, uh,
blow up bombs and study them?

00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:01,863
Yeah. Yeah...

00:12:01,863 --> 00:12:02,864
( <i>knocking</i> )

00:12:02,864 --> 00:12:04,400
Margaret Finn, Public Defender.

00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,968
Cease and desist
any conversation
with my client.

00:12:06,968 --> 00:12:08,470
I’ve been assigned to you.

00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:10,206
Guess the PD was thinking
of all the lawsuits

00:12:10,206 --> 00:12:12,408
Richard Jewell brought
when he was wrongfully accused.

00:12:12,408 --> 00:12:15,244
Someone died in
that office building.

00:12:15,244 --> 00:12:17,446
Ma’am, you seem like
a very nice person

00:12:17,446 --> 00:12:19,848
but these people--they’ve been
very, very good to me.

00:12:19,848 --> 00:12:21,417
I’m sure they have.

00:12:21,417 --> 00:12:24,353
Dominic, I think
you should roll
with your attorney.

00:12:24,353 --> 00:12:26,488
Thanks for your
help, though.

00:12:26,488 --> 00:12:27,289
All right.

00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:28,490
I’ll see you guys later.

00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:29,525
Listen, do me a favor.

00:12:29,525 --> 00:12:31,093
Will you tell Grissom
that if he needs me

00:12:31,093 --> 00:12:33,029
just call me
at home, okay?
All right.

00:12:33,029 --> 00:12:34,930
Let’s roll.

00:12:36,232 --> 00:12:38,834
So all this stuff
is from a five-meter radius

00:12:38,834 --> 00:12:40,569
of the point of origin?

00:12:40,569 --> 00:12:41,837
Yep.

00:12:41,837 --> 00:12:44,640
How could the victim possibly
have been in one piece?

00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,876
Vacuum effect.

00:12:46,876 --> 00:12:49,445
The air is being
pushed out so fast...

00:12:49,445 --> 00:12:52,014
<i>and the bomb detonates...</i>

00:12:52,014 --> 00:12:54,616
<i>there’s a calm at the center...</i>

00:12:58,955 --> 00:13:02,258
Calm, huh?
Well, except for
when he lost his ears.

00:13:02,258 --> 00:13:04,526
Did you figure out
what this "FP" stands for?

00:13:04,526 --> 00:13:07,596
I ran it through
ATF’s bomb database.

00:13:07,596 --> 00:13:09,298
No profile.

00:13:09,298 --> 00:13:11,267
So our bomber’s a newbie.

00:13:11,267 --> 00:13:13,803
Does he fit Grissom’s wack job
from the bomb site?

00:13:13,803 --> 00:13:15,171
Dominic the security guard?

00:13:15,171 --> 00:13:17,206
Ah, it’s too soon to tell.

00:13:17,206 --> 00:13:19,608
I found something interesting.

00:13:19,608 --> 00:13:21,744
What is it?

00:13:23,479 --> 00:13:25,748
Looks like a balance
wheel from a clock.

00:13:25,748 --> 00:13:26,983
Bomb was time-delayed.

00:13:26,983 --> 00:13:28,484
This is a piece
of the timing device.

00:13:28,484 --> 00:13:30,286
What about the orange stuff?

00:13:30,286 --> 00:13:31,453
Heat of the explosion

00:13:31,453 --> 00:13:33,956
must’ve melted whatever it is

00:13:33,956 --> 00:13:34,957
all around the wheel.

00:13:34,957 --> 00:13:36,826
So Sara?

00:13:36,826 --> 00:13:39,328
So what’s orange
and melts?

00:13:39,328 --> 00:13:41,631
I would have
to investigate that.

00:13:41,631 --> 00:13:42,632
Thank you.

00:13:42,632 --> 00:13:44,000
Hey, guys.

00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,101
Can I steal you for a minute?

00:13:45,101 --> 00:13:46,235
I thought this
was your day off.

00:13:46,235 --> 00:13:47,970
We’re kind of busy here, Nick.

00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:50,573
Yeah, I know, and I’m sorry,
but I don’t think this can wait.

00:13:50,573 --> 00:13:52,041
Okay.

00:13:56,212 --> 00:13:59,716
You told me
you weren’t dating her.

00:13:59,716 --> 00:14:00,983
I wasn’t till last night

00:14:00,983 --> 00:14:04,954
after I broke up her fight
with this guy, uh... Jack.

00:14:04,954 --> 00:14:07,189
And Ecklie’s at her house now.

00:14:07,189 --> 00:14:09,291
Yeah, and I can tell you
what he’s going to find.

00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:12,529
My fingerprints, my DNA.

00:14:12,529 --> 00:14:14,864
What were you thinking, Nicky?

00:14:14,864 --> 00:14:17,467
I wasn’t.

00:14:17,467 --> 00:14:21,304
<i>We had a connection, you know?</i>

00:14:21,304 --> 00:14:24,541
<i>Chemistry thing, I guess.</i>

00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:27,310
<i>She was irresistible, man.</i>

00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:30,247
I took off around 4:00.

00:14:30,247 --> 00:14:31,981
Ecklie’s going to be
all over this.

00:14:31,981 --> 00:14:32,982
( <i>knocking</i> )

00:14:32,982 --> 00:14:35,618
Hey, Nick...

00:14:35,618 --> 00:14:37,720
I’m sorry to hear
about your friend.

00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,589
Who told you?

00:14:39,589 --> 00:14:40,890
Word travels.

00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:42,559
It was the day shift coroner.

00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:44,694
So people know
I was with Kristy last night?

00:14:44,694 --> 00:14:46,296
Not yet.

00:14:46,296 --> 00:14:48,231
Maybe I should
just go to Ecklie

00:14:48,231 --> 00:14:49,432
and tell him I was there.

00:14:49,432 --> 00:14:50,933
When you’re a suspect

00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:53,170
and you’re innocent,
you keep your mouth shut.

00:14:54,871 --> 00:14:56,072
I’ll talk to Ecklie.

00:14:56,072 --> 00:14:57,574
Bad idea.
You and Ecklie...

00:14:57,574 --> 00:14:58,775
oil and water.

00:14:58,775 --> 00:15:00,377
Just let me
get into it.

00:15:00,377 --> 00:15:02,979
I can’t just sit here.

00:15:02,979 --> 00:15:04,614
Okay, go for a walk.

00:15:04,614 --> 00:15:07,984
Maybe you’ll accidentally
bump into your guy, "Jack?"

00:15:07,984 --> 00:15:09,519
Yeah.

00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,990
I.D. him, but
don’t approach him.

00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:14,391
Okay.

00:15:19,429 --> 00:15:20,930
If Nick’s arrested

00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:23,433
it’s not going to matter
that he’s cleared later.

00:15:23,433 --> 00:15:25,835
No, it’s an automatic dismissal.

00:15:30,007 --> 00:15:33,410
25-year-old female Caucasian.

00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:38,281
Liver temp’s indicating
time of death at 0600.

00:15:38,281 --> 00:15:42,820
Petichial hemorrhaging,
cyanotic tongue.

00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,021
( <i>door opens</i> )

00:15:44,021 --> 00:15:45,288
Can I help you, Catherine?

00:15:45,288 --> 00:15:46,857
I just want
to see the body, David.

00:15:46,857 --> 00:15:48,792
Unless I’m mistaken,
this is Ecklie’s case.

00:15:48,792 --> 00:15:50,861
Eyes, no hands.

00:15:52,562 --> 00:15:54,664
Look at those ligature marks.

00:15:54,664 --> 00:15:56,233
Petichials...

00:15:56,233 --> 00:15:57,901
blue tongue, the works.

00:15:57,901 --> 00:15:59,102
Raccoon eyes

00:15:59,102 --> 00:16:00,971
excoriation around the neck.

00:16:00,971 --> 00:16:02,840
She didn’t give up easy.

00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,507
Struggled and strangled.

00:16:04,507 --> 00:16:06,944
Ecklie find the murder weapon?

00:16:06,944 --> 00:16:08,311
I only deal with bodies.

00:16:08,311 --> 00:16:10,113
Did you check for fingerprints
on the body?

00:16:10,113 --> 00:16:11,514
Not yet.
Half-life

00:16:11,514 --> 00:16:12,816
of fingerprints on flesh

00:16:12,816 --> 00:16:14,384
they’re disappearing
as we speak.

00:16:14,384 --> 00:16:15,686
Catherine, I like Nick, too.

00:16:15,686 --> 00:16:17,187
I know you’re here for him.

00:16:17,187 --> 00:16:18,221
But what if I lift

00:16:18,221 --> 00:16:19,590
his prints from her?

00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:21,925
Then that’s what you report.

00:16:21,925 --> 00:16:25,829
Evidence, Doc... all we got.

00:16:25,829 --> 00:16:28,666
( <i>ticking</i> )

00:16:34,171 --> 00:16:35,773
( <i>alarm ringing</i> )

00:16:35,773 --> 00:16:36,840
Hey.

00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,809
Could you find that
and turn it off, please?

00:16:38,809 --> 00:16:41,378
( <i>alarm ringing</i> )

00:16:44,247 --> 00:16:46,650
( <i>alarm stops</i> )

00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:48,085
Find the clock
our guy used?

00:16:48,085 --> 00:16:49,487
Not yet.

00:16:49,487 --> 00:16:50,754
This is a good choice.

00:16:50,754 --> 00:16:53,156
According
to the Bomb Data Center

00:16:53,156 --> 00:16:55,793
which has a record
of every component

00:16:55,793 --> 00:16:57,861
used in any bomb--
from Ted Kaczynski

00:16:57,861 --> 00:16:59,863
to teenage boys
playing with fireworks--

00:16:59,863 --> 00:17:02,533
the most recent
timing device of choice

00:17:02,533 --> 00:17:05,769
is made by TimeTell Snoozewell,
$10.99 at any

00:17:05,769 --> 00:17:08,138
local drugstore.

00:17:08,138 --> 00:17:10,408
You’ve spoiled
all my fun.

00:17:11,675 --> 00:17:13,444
Gris, can I get clear
on something here?

00:17:13,444 --> 00:17:14,712
Anything’s possible.

00:17:14,712 --> 00:17:15,813
Catherine gave me

00:17:15,813 --> 00:17:17,781
this "FP" which was part
of the Hansen bomb

00:17:17,781 --> 00:17:19,383
and I’m supposed to figure out

00:17:19,383 --> 00:17:21,118
what tool the bomber used
to engrave it.

00:17:21,118 --> 00:17:23,721
You isolate the tool,
and then we trace it.

00:17:23,721 --> 00:17:25,289
Yeah, but he could’ve used

00:17:25,289 --> 00:17:27,024
any number of things
to initial it.

00:17:27,024 --> 00:17:29,993
I mean, a screwdriver,
a drill bit, a box cutter.

00:17:29,993 --> 00:17:30,994
It’s the same
as guns...

00:17:30,994 --> 00:17:33,197
we eliminate them one at a time.

00:17:33,197 --> 00:17:34,832
What are you guys doing?

00:17:34,832 --> 00:17:37,401
We’re going to go
blow up some bombs.

00:17:37,401 --> 00:17:41,505
Oh, I <i>definitely</i> got the wrong
end of this investigation.

00:17:41,505 --> 00:17:44,575
Alas.
Poor Warrick.

00:18:15,339 --> 00:18:17,641
( <i>buzzing</i> )

00:18:19,077 --> 00:18:20,778
( <i>knocking</i> )

00:18:20,778 --> 00:18:21,645
Oh, hey, uh

00:18:21,645 --> 00:18:23,614
Conrad, Grissom’s in the field.

00:18:23,614 --> 00:18:25,616
I need to speak
with him.

00:18:25,616 --> 00:18:27,051
And I need to speak with you...

00:18:27,051 --> 00:18:28,119
about Nick Stokes.

00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:29,487
Well, let me guess...

00:18:29,487 --> 00:18:31,422
about his involvement
with a dead hooker?

00:18:31,422 --> 00:18:34,192
Come on.
The hooker was a person.

00:18:34,192 --> 00:18:35,493
Her name was Kristy Hopkins.

00:18:35,493 --> 00:18:36,660
I realize that. Thank you.

00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,062
I just came from the lab.

00:18:38,062 --> 00:18:40,364
His prints were all over
Kristy Hopkins’ house.

00:18:40,364 --> 00:18:43,001
Let’s see, wine glass...

00:18:43,001 --> 00:18:44,168
oh, bedside table.

00:18:44,168 --> 00:18:46,237
How’s it going, Cath?

00:18:46,237 --> 00:18:49,007
Nick, I don’t think that you
guys should be talking.

00:18:49,007 --> 00:18:51,575
It’s no big deal.

00:18:51,575 --> 00:18:52,777
What’s up, Ecklie?

00:18:52,777 --> 00:18:55,213
I need a DNA sample
from you, Nick.

00:18:55,213 --> 00:18:56,247
I assume
you’re trying

00:18:56,247 --> 00:18:57,581
to prove Kristy Hopkins and I

00:18:57,581 --> 00:18:59,283
were sexually active last night.

00:18:59,283 --> 00:19:01,753
We found a condom, used.

00:19:01,753 --> 00:19:04,355
And my DNA will match,
no warrant necessary.

00:19:04,355 --> 00:19:06,424
And I have something
else for you.

00:19:08,026 --> 00:19:10,662
I got this off a valet
surveillance tape.

00:19:10,662 --> 00:19:12,163
A license plate number?

00:19:12,163 --> 00:19:13,164
Vehicle belongs

00:19:13,164 --> 00:19:14,633
to Jack Willman.

00:19:14,633 --> 00:19:16,234
Had a fight with Kristy Hopkins
outside the Orpheus

00:19:16,234 --> 00:19:17,435
last night around midnight.

00:19:17,435 --> 00:19:19,003
Well, I’ll look into it

00:19:19,003 --> 00:19:21,640
but come on,
<i>your</i> fingerprints, <i>your</i> DNA

00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,274
that’s what’s
going into evidence.

00:19:23,274 --> 00:19:25,109
You just love that, don’t you?

00:19:25,109 --> 00:19:27,579
You think I want to believe
that a CSI could commit murder?

00:19:27,579 --> 00:19:29,280
Hell, I don’t even want
to believe that a CSI

00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,515
could sleep with a hooker.

00:19:30,515 --> 00:19:31,516
You know what?
Nick’s private life...

00:19:31,516 --> 00:19:32,917
Is no longer private.

00:19:32,917 --> 00:19:34,986
Catherine, I’m sorry
if you guys don’t like

00:19:34,986 --> 00:19:36,888
where the evidence
is pointing.

00:19:36,888 --> 00:19:38,690
But show me otherwise,
tell me I’m wrong.

00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:40,291
In the meantime,
my hands are tied.

00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:42,394
I have protocol to follow.

00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:47,732
I hate that guy.

00:19:47,732 --> 00:19:49,100
Okay, look, I’m going
to get O’Riley

00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,769
to track down this Jack
guy for questioning.

00:19:50,769 --> 00:19:52,671
But I am out on a limb
for you here, Nick.

00:19:52,671 --> 00:19:54,739
Just don’t make it harder
with Ecklie, okay?

00:19:54,739 --> 00:19:55,874
Yeah.

00:19:57,376 --> 00:19:59,944
GRISSOM:
We find the bomber
by understanding the bomb.

00:19:59,944 --> 00:20:02,547
Fortunately, Catherine figured
out the exterior container.

00:20:02,547 --> 00:20:04,148
Aluminum briefcase.

00:20:04,148 --> 00:20:05,450
And we know
the timing device.

00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:06,451
Snoozewell.

00:20:06,451 --> 00:20:07,452
And the propellant.

00:20:07,452 --> 00:20:08,853
Black gunpowder.

00:20:08,853 --> 00:20:10,755
So the final piece of
the bomber’s signature?

00:20:10,755 --> 00:20:12,824
Identify the pipe
containing the powder.

00:20:12,824 --> 00:20:15,427
Three bombs,
scaled down five-to-one

00:20:15,427 --> 00:20:16,861
three different metal pipes.

00:20:16,861 --> 00:20:18,830
Different metals
fly different distances

00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:20,232
when the same force is applied.

00:20:20,232 --> 00:20:22,234
Number one is
a plumber’s ex-flow pipe.

00:20:22,234 --> 00:20:23,602
Number two is
an inflow pipe

00:20:23,602 --> 00:20:24,836
which is thinner.

00:20:24,836 --> 00:20:25,737
Number three

00:20:25,737 --> 00:20:27,071
is galvanized steel

00:20:27,071 --> 00:20:28,773
which is the thinnest metal
of them all.

00:20:35,047 --> 00:20:36,481
You ready?

00:20:38,317 --> 00:20:40,719
Let’s do it, Dan.

00:20:47,326 --> 00:20:48,393
Green.

00:20:48,393 --> 00:20:49,995
That’s the ex-flow pipe.

00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:54,199
Inflow pipe, blue.

00:20:59,871 --> 00:21:02,007
Red, the galvanized steel.

00:21:14,419 --> 00:21:17,522
Last piece of green: ten feet.

00:21:32,204 --> 00:21:36,041
Blue: 16 feet.

00:21:45,985 --> 00:21:48,587
Red: 20 feet.

00:21:55,828 --> 00:21:57,863
Fragments from
the galvanized steel

00:21:57,863 --> 00:21:59,965
traveled the farthest.

00:21:59,965 --> 00:22:01,867
20 feet.
Extrapolating five to one

00:22:01,867 --> 00:22:03,936
that would be 100 feet.

00:22:03,936 --> 00:22:05,605
That’s the outer limit
of visible metal detritus

00:22:05,605 --> 00:22:06,839
at the Hansen building.

00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:10,275
So the bomb was housed
in a thin container

00:22:10,275 --> 00:22:11,677
of galvanized steel.

00:22:11,677 --> 00:22:14,313
Like a muffler or a tailpipe.

00:22:14,313 --> 00:22:16,115
I’ve seen it before.

00:22:16,115 --> 00:22:17,850
It’s a common container
for homemades.

00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:20,486
Don’t you love the smell
of sulfur in the afternoon?

00:22:20,486 --> 00:22:21,921
You might want to go
and take a tour

00:22:21,921 --> 00:22:23,623
of Dominic Kretzker’s house.

00:22:23,623 --> 00:22:25,991
I tracked down the sale
of Snoozewell clocks.

00:22:25,991 --> 00:22:27,793
926 credit card purchases

00:22:27,793 --> 00:22:29,895
in the last three months
in Clark County.

00:22:29,895 --> 00:22:31,564
Seven to Dominic Kretzker

00:22:31,564 --> 00:22:32,965
of Prairie Road.

00:22:55,955 --> 00:22:59,892

00:22:59,892 --> 00:23:01,594
Hey, hey.
That your scanner?

00:23:01,594 --> 00:23:04,129
Yeah, that’s how I knew
you were coming.

00:23:04,129 --> 00:23:06,666
Makes me feel like
I’m part of things.

00:23:06,666 --> 00:23:08,434
Mr. Grissom.

00:23:08,434 --> 00:23:10,536
What can I do for you guys?

00:23:10,536 --> 00:23:12,938
Dominic... this is
the type of device

00:23:12,938 --> 00:23:15,575
that was used to set off
the Hansen bomb.

00:23:15,575 --> 00:23:19,645
We have proof that
you purchased the same
make of clock.

00:23:19,645 --> 00:23:22,182
Yeah, yeah,
I recognize that.

00:23:22,182 --> 00:23:24,717
That houses a nice
little detonator.

00:23:24,717 --> 00:23:27,153
Want to show us
that clock of yours?

00:23:27,153 --> 00:23:29,155
Oh, sure. Come on in.

00:23:32,258 --> 00:23:34,894
The place is kind of a mess.
Sorry.

00:23:34,894 --> 00:23:35,795
Here.

00:23:35,795 --> 00:23:38,098
( <i>straining</i> ):
Here it is.

TimeTell Snoozewell.

00:23:41,234 --> 00:23:43,436
$10.99.

00:23:43,436 --> 00:23:46,039
Well, you can get it for half
price if you’ve got a coupon.

00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:48,875
The timing device
is still intact.

00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:50,443
Yeah, ’cause I haven’t
made the bomb yet.

00:23:50,443 --> 00:23:53,513
But you have made bombs before,
using parts from this make?

00:23:53,513 --> 00:23:54,915
Well, yeah.

00:23:54,915 --> 00:23:57,083
Yeah, I blow them out in back
all the time.

00:23:57,083 --> 00:23:59,552
I blasted a few of them
a couple months ago.

00:23:59,552 --> 00:24:02,155
BRASS:
Hey, look what I found.

00:24:02,155 --> 00:24:02,956
Sulfur.

00:24:02,956 --> 00:24:05,091
You blow up any bombs recently?

00:24:10,563 --> 00:24:11,597
Is this from the Hansen bomb?

00:24:11,597 --> 00:24:13,233
Sure is.

00:24:13,233 --> 00:24:14,667
You’re keeping a key piece
of evidence

00:24:14,667 --> 00:24:15,869
that could nail you?

00:24:15,869 --> 00:24:17,070
Hey, that’s sentimental.

00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:19,339
Well, that’s cute.

00:24:19,339 --> 00:24:20,874
No, I mean, it is.

00:24:20,874 --> 00:24:23,076
That’s like, you know,
Waco and Trade Center.

00:24:23,076 --> 00:24:25,011
I mean, that’s historical.

00:24:25,011 --> 00:24:27,080
I didn’t have a war,
all right?

00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,782
I’m too flatfooted for the P.D.

00:24:28,782 --> 00:24:30,516
and that’s as close to history
as I’m going to get.

00:24:30,516 --> 00:24:31,918
I collect souvenirs.

00:24:31,918 --> 00:24:33,586

If I had anything to hide,
I’d hide it.

I’m pretty proud of that

Could you do me a favor?

Can you put the jacket

No family to speak of.

00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:27,001
Has anyone claimed her?

00:26:27,001 --> 00:26:29,036
For burial?
Friend, old roommate?

00:26:29,036 --> 00:26:30,071
There’s no one.

00:26:30,071 --> 00:26:31,805

00:26:35,509 --> 00:26:37,078
No, I’ll pay.

given the circumstances?

to understand the other side
of law enforcement.

You think I’m guilty, don’t you?

00:28:12,507 --> 00:28:15,343
Fatality was
on the check-in line

00:28:15,343 --> 00:28:17,245
and died on the way
to the hospital.

00:28:17,245 --> 00:28:19,314
Anybody report hearing
a noise? Ticking?

00:28:19,314 --> 00:28:20,548
No, no one heard anything.

00:28:20,548 --> 00:28:22,149
SIDLE:
Ah, it’s not
the firemen

00:28:22,149 --> 00:28:24,486
it’s the rain.
This crime scene is trashed.

00:28:30,492 --> 00:28:32,160
What do you have?

00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,229
Form follows function.

00:28:34,229 --> 00:28:36,764
They’ve never been able
to make a better one.

00:28:36,764 --> 00:28:38,200
Mousetrap.

00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,635
That orange stuff again.

00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:45,773
Someone picks it up,
motion trips the trap,
sets off the timer.

00:28:45,773 --> 00:28:48,543
SIDLE:
Which sets off the bomb.

00:28:48,543 --> 00:28:49,677
( <i>explosion</i> )

00:28:53,581 --> 00:28:56,051
Be right back.

00:28:56,051 --> 00:28:57,819
We say nothing
to the media or anybody.

00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:00,855
Our bomber’s signature
just got a little more
sophisticated.

00:29:00,855 --> 00:29:02,024
Excuse me.

00:29:02,024 --> 00:29:03,458
Hi, I’m with the Crime Lab.

00:29:03,458 --> 00:29:06,962
I’m sorry, but I have
to take your jacket.

00:29:06,962 --> 00:29:09,164
Um... okay.

00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:10,598
If it’ll help.

00:29:10,598 --> 00:29:12,300
Thanks.

00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:17,906
What are you doing?

00:29:17,906 --> 00:29:20,842
Polyethylene-terephtalete.

00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:21,944
Polyester.

00:29:21,944 --> 00:29:23,445
Orange stuff.

00:29:25,848 --> 00:29:28,250
GRISSOM:
You’re free to go.

00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:30,252
I wanted to tell you
in person.

00:29:30,252 --> 00:29:32,554
You mean, you weren’t
just in the neighborhood?

00:29:32,554 --> 00:29:35,123
That second bomb--
it wasn’t remote, was it?

00:29:35,123 --> 00:29:36,758
Otherwise I’d
still be a suspect.

00:29:36,758 --> 00:29:38,861
I can’t discuss it.

00:29:38,861 --> 00:29:42,765
So I guess you’re not going to
be needing my expertise anymore.

00:29:42,765 --> 00:29:44,232
I mean, investigation-wise.

00:29:44,232 --> 00:29:47,635
I knew it was too good
to be true.

00:29:47,635 --> 00:29:51,039
Well, proud to have worked
with you, sir.

00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,575
Dominic... I’m not
a police officer.

00:29:53,575 --> 00:29:55,811
I-I-I’m a crime
scene analyst.

00:29:55,811 --> 00:29:58,781
Yeah, but we know who
really solves the crimes,
don’t we, sir?

00:29:58,781 --> 00:30:01,083
Good luck.

00:30:01,083 --> 00:30:02,618
Take care of yourself.

00:30:02,618 --> 00:30:03,752
Thank you.

00:30:06,989 --> 00:30:08,757
Hey, Dom?

00:30:08,757 --> 00:30:10,859
Yeah?
Next time

00:30:10,859 --> 00:30:13,028
try not to be quite so trusting.

00:30:13,028 --> 00:30:15,463
You don’t need
to be a hero.

00:30:24,807 --> 00:30:26,408
I ran priors.

00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:30,879
The guy’s got
an ’88 conviction
for sexual assault.

00:30:30,879 --> 00:30:33,782
Boy, if I ever get in trouble,
I know which CSI I’m going to.

00:30:35,918 --> 00:30:38,386
Let’s watch the show.

00:30:44,192 --> 00:30:46,562
How would you characterize

00:30:46,562 --> 00:30:48,063
your relationship
with Kristy Hopkins?

00:30:48,063 --> 00:30:50,833
Oh, sir, we can
just cut the crap.

00:30:50,833 --> 00:30:52,067
I saw him kill Kristy.

00:30:52,067 --> 00:30:54,102
I saw everything.

00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:55,938
O’RILEY:
Go on.

00:30:55,938 --> 00:30:58,173
Well, Kristy and I,
we had words.

00:30:58,173 --> 00:31:00,876
I was swinging by her place
to tell her I was sorry

00:31:00,876 --> 00:31:02,645
but, uh...

00:31:04,247 --> 00:31:07,316
<i>I didn’t expect to see her</i>
<i>with a guy.</i>

00:31:07,316 --> 00:31:08,884
<i>They were fighting.</i>

00:31:08,884 --> 00:31:10,586
<i>I couldn’t make out</i>
<i>what they were saying</i>

00:31:10,586 --> 00:31:12,655
<i>but he was pushing her around</i>
pretty hard.

00:31:12,655 --> 00:31:14,156
( <i>arguing</i> )

00:31:14,156 --> 00:31:16,959
Could you I.D. this guy?
Yeah.

00:31:16,959 --> 00:31:18,994
It was like, Nick something.

00:31:18,994 --> 00:31:22,131
Kristy and I bumped into him
at The Orpheus earlier.

00:31:22,131 --> 00:31:23,899
O’RILEY:
And you saw him kill her?

00:31:23,899 --> 00:31:27,536
Well, I saw him
get violent, but
then I took off.

00:31:27,536 --> 00:31:29,205
And you didn’t try
to help the girl?

00:31:29,205 --> 00:31:31,874
He’s one of you guys.

00:31:31,874 --> 00:31:33,942
He carries a gun.

00:31:33,942 --> 00:31:35,544
I’m no hero.

00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:41,284
So can I go?

00:31:43,419 --> 00:31:46,122
O’RILEY:
Yeah.

00:31:47,923 --> 00:31:50,026
The witness
sounds believable.

00:31:50,026 --> 00:31:52,861
It’s a load of crap
and you know it.

00:31:52,861 --> 00:31:54,130
I was listening.

00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:56,232
He seemed credible to me.

00:31:56,232 --> 00:31:58,101
Sheriff, you
arrest Nick now

00:31:58,101 --> 00:31:59,435
you end his career.

00:31:59,435 --> 00:32:01,670
So what can you offer me?

00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:04,407
Nothing, except my gut
and ten years of experience.

00:32:04,407 --> 00:32:05,508
He didn’t do this.

00:32:05,508 --> 00:32:07,576
Ignore the evidence
against Stokes

00:32:07,576 --> 00:32:10,379
it looks like special favors
for CSI.

00:32:10,379 --> 00:32:11,780
Well, I can’t have that.

00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:12,916
Not and keep my post.

00:32:12,916 --> 00:32:15,251
So give me 12 hours,
access to the crime scene

00:32:15,251 --> 00:32:17,520
and evidence without
filing papers on Nick.

00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,489
12 hours.

00:32:20,489 --> 00:32:22,658
But then we arrest
Mr. Stokes

00:32:22,658 --> 00:32:26,162
with all the attendant
documentation.

00:32:40,043 --> 00:32:42,078
How you doing, Greg?

00:32:42,078 --> 00:32:43,179
Same as you.

00:32:43,179 --> 00:32:44,848
Yeah.
Worried about Nick.

00:32:44,848 --> 00:32:47,083
I need to see his DNA
from the crime scene.

00:32:47,083 --> 00:32:48,351
You have it, right?

00:32:48,351 --> 00:32:50,486
A sample from the condom,
yeah.

00:32:50,486 --> 00:32:52,321
Popsicled in the freezer.

00:32:52,321 --> 00:32:54,323
But, uh, it’s not your case.

00:32:54,323 --> 00:32:57,293
Much as I want to help,
no can do.

00:32:57,293 --> 00:32:59,362
It’s my case
for the next 12 hours.

00:32:59,362 --> 00:33:02,398
Ask the Sheriff.

00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:04,668
You know, I would never doubt
your word.

00:33:04,668 --> 00:33:06,269
Smart man.

00:33:13,042 --> 00:33:15,144
Nick’s little soldiers.

00:33:15,144 --> 00:33:17,146
It’s all you.

00:33:17,146 --> 00:33:20,383
Thanks, Greg.

00:33:20,383 --> 00:33:24,220
WILLOWS:
When did you say
this sample was frozen?

00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,722
Um, 10:15 a.m.

00:33:25,722 --> 00:33:26,790
Why?

00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:30,226
These guys are all heads,
no tails.

00:33:30,226 --> 00:33:33,663
That’s normal, given
the post-ejaculate time frame.

00:33:33,663 --> 00:33:35,999
How is that going
to help Nick?

00:33:35,999 --> 00:33:37,801
WILLOWS:
<i>The sperm found</i>

00:33:37,801 --> 00:33:40,169
in the condom
was frozen at 10:15 a.m.

00:33:40,169 --> 00:33:42,205
It’s all heads, no tails.

00:33:42,205 --> 00:33:44,474
I’m not quite up
to speed on the
particulars of...

00:33:44,474 --> 00:33:46,410
It takes about seven hours

00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:47,877
for bacteria to eat away
at the tails

00:33:47,877 --> 00:33:50,347
placing the time of ejaculation
at around 2:00 a.m.

00:33:50,347 --> 00:33:52,282
but Kristy’s time of death
was 6:00 a.m.

00:33:52,282 --> 00:33:55,719
Well, it suggests a lag
between ejaculation
and Kristy’s murder

00:33:55,719 --> 00:33:57,687
but it doesn’t disprove
Nick’s presence

00:33:57,687 --> 00:33:59,456
at the time of
the homicide.

00:33:59,456 --> 00:34:01,891
You could be
a little more supportive.

00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,929
I have a new favorite color.

00:34:05,929 --> 00:34:07,096
Orange?
The orange

00:34:07,096 --> 00:34:08,898
polyester from the bomb
is a match

00:34:08,898 --> 00:34:10,066
to the Thrift-Right jacket.

00:34:10,066 --> 00:34:13,002
Guess where their regional
headquarters is located.

00:34:13,002 --> 00:34:14,771
The Hansen Building.
You bet.

00:34:14,771 --> 00:34:16,039
I ran a Lexis search

00:34:16,039 --> 00:34:18,708
looking for disgruntled
employees, irate customers

00:34:18,708 --> 00:34:20,777
anyone with a grievance
against Thrift-Right.

00:34:20,777 --> 00:34:22,879
You get any hits?
Norman Stirling.

00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:24,013
Former manager.

00:34:24,013 --> 00:34:25,982
How disgruntled?
Let go

00:34:25,982 --> 00:34:27,117
last year.

00:34:27,117 --> 00:34:28,518
Caused a commotion at H.Q.

00:34:28,518 --> 00:34:31,488
Filed lawsuits
against the company.

00:34:31,488 --> 00:34:33,657
Guy’s been out of work
ever since.

00:34:33,657 --> 00:34:36,693
Sitting around
making bombs.

00:34:42,866 --> 00:34:44,734
Norman Stirling?

00:34:44,734 --> 00:34:47,471
Yes.

00:34:47,471 --> 00:34:49,839
What’s going on?

00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,341
FP.

00:34:51,341 --> 00:34:53,343
What?

00:34:53,343 --> 00:34:55,645
You don’t recognize
those initials?

00:34:58,015 --> 00:35:00,317
What’s this about?

00:35:00,317 --> 00:35:01,819
The bombing of the
Thrift-Right Car Rental.

00:35:01,819 --> 00:35:03,453
The bombing of the
Hansen Building.

00:35:03,453 --> 00:35:05,856
A-A bomb? Are you kidding?

00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:08,692
I’ve never even been <i>near</i>
a bomb my entire life.

00:35:08,692 --> 00:35:10,294
Well, those orange jackets

00:35:10,294 --> 00:35:11,695
over there appear to match

00:35:11,695 --> 00:35:14,331
the materials
the bombs were wrapped in.

00:35:14,331 --> 00:35:16,366
I used to wear those
to go to work.

00:35:16,366 --> 00:35:17,835
BRASS:
You were let go
by Thrift-Right

00:35:17,835 --> 00:35:19,036
last year, and lost
a court battle

00:35:19,036 --> 00:35:20,570
to get your job back.

00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:23,140
BRASS:
In fact, they filed
a TRO against you

00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:26,243
for throwing furniture around
their headquarters last July.

00:35:26,243 --> 00:35:28,445
I want to call my lawyer.

00:35:28,445 --> 00:35:30,214
Good, you can call him
from the car.

00:35:30,214 --> 00:35:31,348
He can meet us at the PD.

00:35:31,348 --> 00:35:32,750
Take him in.
Come on, let’s go.

00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:33,884
Call your mom.

00:36:47,725 --> 00:36:50,828
WILLOWS:
Kristy Hopkins was strangled
with this sash.

00:36:50,828 --> 00:36:53,731
It’s fingerprint-free,
but the force of the pull

00:36:53,731 --> 00:36:55,065
would have scratched
off epithelials

00:36:55,065 --> 00:36:56,334
from the killer’s
hands, right?

00:36:56,334 --> 00:36:57,768
Abraded, yeah.
And can you

00:36:57,768 --> 00:36:59,470
extract DNA from epithelials?

00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:00,938
If they’re fresh enough.

00:37:16,254 --> 00:37:20,158
GREG:
Okay, epithelials
are an affirmative.

00:37:20,158 --> 00:37:22,760
And they’re good to go
for DNA profiling.

00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:25,163
I’m just going to need something
to compare it to.

00:37:25,163 --> 00:37:27,732
Jack Willman has a prior
for a sexual assault

00:37:27,732 --> 00:37:29,800
so his DNA is on file.

00:37:40,311 --> 00:37:42,613
Well?

00:37:44,916 --> 00:37:47,819
I think that you and I should
head over to the police station.

00:37:49,921 --> 00:37:52,991
DNA didn’t pan out, huh?

00:37:52,991 --> 00:37:55,827
Never have I seen
such a clean match.

00:37:57,195 --> 00:37:58,897
Jack Willman killed her.

00:38:08,039 --> 00:38:11,209
( <i>sighing</i> )

00:38:11,209 --> 00:38:13,244
Thank you.

00:38:13,244 --> 00:38:14,813
Hey...

00:38:14,813 --> 00:38:17,983
Hey, I’m just
doing my job.

00:38:17,983 --> 00:38:19,918
Besides, if they’d
sent you to jail

00:38:19,918 --> 00:38:22,320
I’d get stuck
with all your cases.

00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,656
( <i>laughs</i> )

00:38:27,458 --> 00:38:29,460
Dispatch said
you were looking for me?

00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:30,596
Yeah.

00:38:30,596 --> 00:38:33,264
I finally matched this "FP."

00:38:33,264 --> 00:38:35,534
To this electric etcher.

00:38:35,534 --> 00:38:36,835
Now, I made an exemplar.

00:38:36,835 --> 00:38:37,869
<i>Boom!</i>

00:38:37,869 --> 00:38:39,871
WARRICK:
Identical type of striations.

00:38:39,871 --> 00:38:42,040
The manufacturer says

00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:45,443
that this etcher is only used
for training purposes.

00:38:45,443 --> 00:38:47,879
And it’s only sold in bulk.

00:38:47,879 --> 00:38:50,516
It was not sold
to Norman Stirling.

00:38:50,516 --> 00:38:53,318
So who bought it?

00:38:53,318 --> 00:38:55,086
Las Vegas School District.

00:38:55,086 --> 00:38:56,955
I called the district
and we traced it down

00:38:56,955 --> 00:38:58,957
to one high school--
Summit High.

00:38:58,957 --> 00:39:03,128
Stirling’s son goes there.

00:39:03,128 --> 00:39:08,767
BRASS:
Tyler, were you aware
of your father’s lawsuits

00:39:08,767 --> 00:39:12,070
against Thrift-Right
Car Rental?

00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:14,440
Yeah. It was kind of hard
not to be.

00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:19,077
I mean, it’s all him and my mom
talked about for a year.

00:39:20,546 --> 00:39:22,481
Until she left.

00:39:22,481 --> 00:39:24,683
Do you miss your mother?

00:39:26,452 --> 00:39:28,987
I miss our old life.

00:39:31,257 --> 00:39:34,160
( <i>quietly</i> ):
Is there something
that we should be talking about?

00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,494
You know, in private?

00:39:35,494 --> 00:39:39,865
You said that’s how corporations
do it--in private.

00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:45,737
See, they treated him great
at work, in front of everyone.

00:39:45,737 --> 00:39:47,639
And then they let him go
at the end of the day

00:39:47,639 --> 00:39:48,907
when no one’s around.

00:39:48,907 --> 00:39:50,909
Thirty years of service
and then...

00:39:50,909 --> 00:39:53,379
you know, they realized
they could hire two young guys

00:39:53,379 --> 00:39:54,913
at half the price.

00:39:54,913 --> 00:39:58,350
BRASS:
What does "FP"
stand for?

00:39:59,918 --> 00:40:02,154
It was etched into both bombs.

00:40:02,154 --> 00:40:03,922
We think you engraved it
with an implement

00:40:03,922 --> 00:40:06,258
from your high school
shop class.

00:40:10,529 --> 00:40:12,731
"Fair Play."

00:40:20,806 --> 00:40:22,541
I used to yell that
around the house

00:40:22,541 --> 00:40:24,510
that I was owed fair play.

00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:25,811
TYLER:
I mean, they threw him

00:40:25,811 --> 00:40:27,579
out like trash.

00:40:27,579 --> 00:40:29,648
And you sent them bombs?

00:40:29,648 --> 00:40:34,353
You said you wanted
to kill them.

00:40:39,826 --> 00:40:41,961
How did you even know
how to do this?

00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:45,998
Off the Internet.

00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,703
Dad, are you mad at me?

00:40:53,239 --> 00:40:54,774
I did it for you.

00:40:54,774 --> 00:40:57,376
Tyler, did you make
any more bombs?

00:40:59,712 --> 00:41:01,681
Where are they?

00:41:01,681 --> 00:41:03,683
Where are you keeping them?

00:41:09,155 --> 00:41:11,523
Tyler...

00:41:11,523 --> 00:41:15,161
if you did this for me...

00:41:15,161 --> 00:41:17,930
please tell them where they are.

00:41:20,967 --> 00:41:24,871
( <i>man over dispatch</i> )
Victor 9, Victor 9,
report to Summit High School.

00:41:24,871 --> 00:41:27,206
Prairie road.
Repeat: Prairie road.

00:41:27,206 --> 00:41:33,279
Reported bomb outside
Classroom 22B in Locker 897.

00:41:33,279 --> 00:41:34,514
( <i>radio static</i> )

00:41:34,514 --> 00:41:37,684
Bomb is trigger-activated
and motion-delayed.

00:41:37,684 --> 00:41:38,885
Do not handle.

00:41:38,885 --> 00:41:40,286
P.A. SYSTEM:
Students and faculty

00:41:40,286 --> 00:41:42,288
and all school personnel

00:41:42,288 --> 00:41:43,623
please exit the building
immediately.

00:41:43,623 --> 00:41:45,392
Security Detail, let’s go!

00:41:45,392 --> 00:41:47,159
I need Classroom 22B.

00:41:47,159 --> 00:41:48,528
Second floor!
Where’s 22B?

00:41:48,528 --> 00:41:49,862
Come on, people!

00:41:55,034 --> 00:41:57,136
Come on, people, don’t run.

00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:05,778
All students and faculty

00:42:05,778 --> 00:42:08,881
please exit the facilities
immediately.

00:42:26,666 --> 00:42:29,402
Get out of my way, people.

00:42:29,402 --> 00:42:34,141
Come around me.

00:42:34,141 --> 00:42:37,844
( <i>sirens blaring</i> )

00:42:45,418 --> 00:42:46,386
Dominic, stop!

00:42:46,386 --> 00:42:47,954
Stop right there.
Put it down!

00:42:47,954 --> 00:42:49,889
No, it’s all right.
Everyone’s safe.

00:42:49,889 --> 00:42:52,092
No, no, no, drop it.
It’s <i>active!</i>

00:43:13,713 --> 00:43:15,615
Hi. Just the guy
I wanted to see.

00:43:15,615 --> 00:43:17,918
O’Riley.

00:43:19,052 --> 00:43:20,387
Tell me why you did it.

00:43:20,387 --> 00:43:22,522
I got nothing to
say to you, cowboy.

00:43:24,091 --> 00:43:26,659
She was going back to college,
turning her life around

00:43:26,659 --> 00:43:29,129
getting out of the business,
and you <i>killed</i> her for it!

00:43:29,129 --> 00:43:30,163
Why?

00:43:30,163 --> 00:43:31,364
Is that what
she told you?

00:43:31,364 --> 00:43:33,500
She was getting out
of the business?

00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:36,269
She was going to college
to recruit more girls.

00:43:36,269 --> 00:43:37,905
Do you think
I’m going to believe

00:43:37,905 --> 00:43:39,172
the john that killed her?

00:43:39,172 --> 00:43:41,093
Oh, and you think
I was her client?

00:43:41,093 --> 00:43:42,527
I was her pimp.

00:43:44,127 --> 00:43:48,060
She was leaving me
to start her own racket.

00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:50,393
So wake up. This
isn’t <i>Pretty Woman.</i>

00:43:50,393 --> 00:43:51,827
She’s not Julia Roberts.

00:43:51,827 --> 00:43:53,393
You’re not Richard Gere.

00:43:53,393 --> 00:43:54,727
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:43:54,727 --> 00:43:56,827
I guess you’re right.

00:43:56,827 --> 00:44:00,260
Because there’s no
happy ending for you.

00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:03,393
Twenty-five to life.

00:44:03,393 --> 00:44:05,260
WILLOWS:
Get him out of here.

00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:21,293
Above the fold.
