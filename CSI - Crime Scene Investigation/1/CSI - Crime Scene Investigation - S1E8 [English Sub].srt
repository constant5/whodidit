00:01:19,542 --> 00:01:21,044
Oh... you're
gonna love this.

00:01:27,417 --> 00:01:28,818
Ring any bells?

00:01:28,885 --> 00:01:31,354
Rub-a-dub-dub,
dead man in a tub.

00:01:31,421 --> 00:01:35,058
Sleeping bag
for easy cleanup

00:01:35,124 --> 00:01:37,527
open window so the stench

00:01:37,593 --> 00:01:39,929
alerts
the neighbors...

00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:43,199
It's Royce Harmon
all over again.

00:01:46,602 --> 00:01:48,604
What do you think?

00:01:48,671 --> 00:01:50,873
"Suicide" note
in the same place?

00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:53,376
You tell me, Karnac.

00:02:03,686 --> 00:02:05,121
Now that's weird.

00:02:05,188 --> 00:02:08,091
Not weird. Intentional.

00:02:08,157 --> 00:02:12,428
( <i>recorder plays gibberish</i> )

00:02:15,164 --> 00:02:18,067
What kind of language is that?
Swedish?

00:02:19,602 --> 00:02:20,770
It's backward.

00:02:27,143 --> 00:02:28,745
Would you excuse me
a minute?

00:02:30,446 --> 00:02:32,582
Sure... okay.

00:02:45,395 --> 00:02:46,562
He okay in there?

00:02:46,629 --> 00:02:49,399
Quincy wants to be alone.

00:02:49,465 --> 00:02:51,200
We had a case like this
three months ago

00:02:51,267 --> 00:02:52,635
a guy found dead in his bathtub.

00:02:52,702 --> 00:02:55,505
Turned out the suicide
was staged.

00:02:55,571 --> 00:02:58,474
Found a mini-recorder
as a suicide note.

00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:00,410
Killer may have struck again.

00:03:00,476 --> 00:03:01,878
Why does he want
to be alone?

00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,849
He wants to get his mojo
working.

00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:10,520
Man on mini-recorder:
My name is Stuart Rampler.

00:03:10,586 --> 00:03:13,322
I reside
at 818 Boeing Hill Court

00:03:13,389 --> 00:03:15,324
Las Vegas, Nevada.

00:03:15,391 --> 00:03:18,694
I am 43 years of age
and I'm going to kill myself.

00:03:18,761 --> 00:03:21,831
I just can't do it anymore.

00:03:21,898 --> 00:03:24,500
I love you, Mom.

Have Mandy dust it
and run prints on it
right away.


00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:13,453
Photos from tonight's
suicide.


00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,921
Put a "rush"
on them for you.


00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:16,556
Photos, thank you.


00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:24,597
Oh...

Throw the flag, ref!


00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,500
Stokes:
Uncatchable, bro.


00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:29,736
Hey! you guys want


00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:32,138
an assignment slip
or a pink slip?


00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:35,642
I was just taking
a little coffee break.


00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:37,978
Is it true?


00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:39,646
Same guy?


00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:41,214
I don't know.


00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,582
We'll see.


00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,184
Here, "410"


00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,186
reckless driver
out at Hoover Dam.


00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:47,554
Car went over a cliff.


00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,756
Anonymous caller.


00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:51,925
Could be foul play.


00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:55,095
Oh, me and him,
working together?


00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:56,696
Oh, it's on.


00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:57,964
You're going down, bro.


00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:01,368
Hey! Work together
tonight.


00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:03,003
All right?


00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:09,643
Okay, we're going
off the board tonight.


00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:11,277
Off the board?


00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:13,013
"The ones that got away."


00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,381
Fish.


00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:15,849
Ah, I missed that one.


00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:17,417
First victim,
Royce Harmon.


00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:20,320
About three months ago
Brass and I found this guy


00:05:20,387 --> 00:05:22,756
dead in his own bathtub,
but his "suicide"


00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:23,823
was staged.


00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,525
I think the killer
has killed again.


00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:26,826
Photos of tonight's victim


00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:28,361
Stuart Rampler.


00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:31,398
Play the "pick six things
that are different" game.


00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:32,399
Bet you lose.


00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:33,500
Sidell:
This guy's good.


00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:36,036
Not good. Exceptional.


00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:40,273
Print Examiner lifted a
thumbprint off the mini-recorder


00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,976
near the tub
of our first victim.


00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:45,679
The print came back this.


00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:48,581
The killer purchased one
of these rubber hands


00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:50,950
laced the fingertips
with cooking spray


00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,086
and proceeded
to place false prints


00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:54,754
all around
the crime scene.


00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:56,990
This guy is good.


00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:58,024
Whose prints are these?


00:05:58,091 --> 00:05:59,626
Some guy who works
in a warehouse


00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,227
making Halloween paraphernalia.


00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:03,830
Scary masks,
air-brushed tombstones


00:06:03,897 --> 00:06:05,031
rubber hands.


00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:06,533
He used his own hand
for the mold.


00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:07,701
Willows:
So what do we do?


00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:08,702
Grissom:
We split up.


00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:09,903
You and I go
to the coroner.


00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,671
Sara, you go
to the hotel.


00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:13,473
Dust every inch
of that bathroom.


00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,875
Here, use this.


00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:17,811
"Red Creeper."
My own concoction.


00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:19,980
Wow.


00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,649
Hmm-mm, serious case,
serious print powder.


00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,150
Be thorough.


00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,719
Don't take anything for granted.


00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:27,087
Yes, sir.


00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:35,028
( <i>electric saw buzzing</i> )


00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:41,501
Everyone still breathing
in that car?

00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:43,470
So far.

00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:44,804
Call came in blind.

00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:46,272
You see
who could have made it?

00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:48,942
No, we were first
on the scene.

00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:50,744
Fire department came in

00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,779
two minutes behind.

00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:56,016
Place
was dead quiet.

00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:04,157
Where's the driver?

00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:05,659
He get thrown?

00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:07,127
Officer:
Didn't find anybody.

00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:14,868
I'm thinking DUI.

00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,136
You calling it?

00:07:18,505 --> 00:07:20,206
Stokes:
I'm calling

00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,575
that beer bottle.

00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:28,481
How do you know
it's from the car?

00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:34,187
It's still cold.

00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:37,624
Foam in the bottle.

00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:38,825
Take it up top?

00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:41,428
After you...

00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:46,466
I've read Klausbach's report
on Royce Harmon

00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:48,702
the first staged suicide.

00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:50,537
Similarities?
Well, based

00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:52,872
on the entry wound,
they were both murdered.

00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:54,541
But here's where it gets fun.

00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:57,877
He was shot trying
to protect himself.

00:07:57,944 --> 00:08:00,146
What else, Doc?
My mind is painting.

00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:01,982
He was paid a little visit

00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:04,050
from Mr. Muzzle Stamp.

00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:08,388
Forced into the tub at gunpoint?

00:08:08,455 --> 00:08:09,789
Okay.

00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:12,826
Let's play it out.

00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:14,361
The killer's got him

00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:15,695
at gunpoint, right?

00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:16,896
Standing over him

00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:18,698
like this.

00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:19,933
No!!

00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:26,506
But this time, things got messy.

00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:28,141
Royce Harmon didn't fight back.

00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:31,011
That's why there was no muzzle
bruising to his temple.

00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:32,479
Stuart Rampler
was resistant.

00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:34,948
He didn't want to get
into that tub too easily.

00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,082
He took a few jabs

00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:37,250
to the temple.

00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:39,486
But the killer
just lost round one.

00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:41,688
We know how he gets his vics
into the tub

00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:44,090
and we know that both deaths
were homicides.

00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:45,592
It's not a bad start.

00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:54,067
The skid started
way up the road.

00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:56,469
I got him doing at least 70.

00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,506
More like 80.

00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:02,342
These grooves
are from the car's frame.

00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:04,711
It balanced
before it fell.

00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:07,547
This is where he bailed.

00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:13,386
Wide spacing,
slipping of the heel.

00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:15,989
He ran.

00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:18,491
Who?

00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,161
The phantom driver.

00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,862
Hey, hand me another beer.

00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:23,963
No, you've had enough.

00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:26,800
( <i>car horn blaring</i> )
Hey, hey...!

00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:28,134
( <i>tires squealing</i> )

00:09:45,552 --> 00:09:48,521
So your drunk driver
just got out

00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,490
and ran away?

00:09:50,557 --> 00:09:51,658
Where to?

00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:52,659
I don't know.

00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:53,860
That's why we're up here.

00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,829
But he left his buddy
hanging out to dry.

00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:56,830
I can tell you that.

00:09:56,896 --> 00:10:00,767
Then how do you explain
car number two?

00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:03,703
Stokes:
Driver ran to this point,
car picks him up.

00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,138
Here are your tracks...

00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:07,273
Probably took him
to the hospital.

00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,476
Not if we have these.

00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:12,278
They're kind of
out of place.

00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:15,415
A walking stride
up to the edge.

00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:17,417
( <i>camera shutter clicking</i> )

00:10:19,653 --> 00:10:20,987
No.

00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,760
This is a crime,
not an accident.

00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:31,364
You care to back
that statement up?

00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,401
My phantom driver
against your criminal?

00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,568
How much?

00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:37,737
50.

00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:40,707
I don't get out of bed
for less than a bill.

00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:50,550
Hey, Evans.

00:10:50,617 --> 00:10:52,686
Hi.

00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:54,387
Victim's name

00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:56,156
is Stuart Rampler.

00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:57,157
Lives in town

00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:59,159
reserved a room
for one night

00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:01,561
because his house
was being fumigated.

00:11:01,628 --> 00:11:03,330
Hmm.

00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:04,864
Find anything unusual?

00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:07,534
I bagged a couple
of utility bills.

00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:10,770
Ready for mail.

00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,941
It's almost
as if he wanted

00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,243
to take care
of some unfinished business

00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,545
before he checked out.

00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:20,480
Well, it's not likely.

00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:22,749
His suicide was staged.

00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:34,327
Evans:
It's an upside-down stamp.

00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:35,562
What does that mean?

00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:37,597
I don't know.

00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:47,374
Wow, this stuff rocks.

00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,942
I love bathrooms.

00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:53,813
Last time I printed
a hotel bathroom

00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,482
I had over 1,000 prints.

00:11:59,653 --> 00:12:02,122
Okay...

00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:04,958
close the doors
and hit the lights, Daddy-o.

00:12:32,018 --> 00:12:34,120
He wiped it clean.

00:12:34,187 --> 00:12:35,155
Yeah.

00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:37,724
This guy's a real pro.

00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:40,893
Not only did he wipe it clean,
it's sterile.

00:12:50,835 --> 00:12:52,737
I thought you were going
to tell me that you caught him.

00:12:52,804 --> 00:12:55,340
Mrs. Harmon, we believe
that the person

00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:59,177
who did this to your son
may have done it to someone else

00:12:59,244 --> 00:13:01,947
and we need your help.

00:13:02,013 --> 00:13:03,248
Well, what can I do?

00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:06,952
We talked to
the second victim's girlfriend

00:13:07,018 --> 00:13:08,520
and played his suicide recording
for her.

00:13:08,586 --> 00:13:10,522
She confirmed that

00:13:10,588 --> 00:13:12,357
it was his voice.

00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:13,858
But I already told you

00:13:13,925 --> 00:13:16,928
that the voice on that
tape was not my son's.

00:13:16,995 --> 00:13:19,464
I know. We just need
to be absolutely certain.

00:13:19,531 --> 00:13:21,866
Do you have a recording
of your son's voice

00:13:21,933 --> 00:13:24,502
so that we could tie
the killings together?

00:13:24,569 --> 00:13:27,505
Anything, Mrs. Harmon--
a home movie?

00:13:27,572 --> 00:13:29,808
A recorded message off
your answering machine?

00:13:29,874 --> 00:13:32,911
All I have are pictures.

00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,846
I may have something.

00:13:34,913 --> 00:13:37,415
Royce gave this to me

00:13:37,482 --> 00:13:40,619
for Mother's Day
last year.

00:13:40,685 --> 00:13:45,156
It's a talking frame.

00:13:45,223 --> 00:13:49,361
It's all I have left.

00:13:49,427 --> 00:13:51,196
Hey, Mom, it's Royce.

00:13:51,262 --> 00:13:53,064
I know you're always complaining

00:13:53,131 --> 00:13:55,667
you don't hear my voice
in the house anymore.

00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:58,670
Well, now you can listen to it
anytime you want.

00:13:58,737 --> 00:13:59,804
I love you.

00:13:59,871 --> 00:14:02,240
( <i>softly</i> ):
I love you, too.

00:14:04,876 --> 00:14:06,544
Mr. Backseat
going to make it?

00:14:06,611 --> 00:14:08,647
The name's Walter Bangler.
He'll live.

00:14:08,713 --> 00:14:10,015
He well enough to talk?

00:14:10,081 --> 00:14:12,951
Subdural hematoma,
compound rib fractures...

00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:15,287
All right, all right,
I get the picture.

00:14:15,353 --> 00:14:17,455
How long
until we can see him?

00:14:17,522 --> 00:14:20,859
I didn't say you
couldn't <i>see</i> him.

00:14:20,925 --> 00:14:23,228
He's sedated.

00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:24,763
If you want to talk to him

00:14:24,829 --> 00:14:28,066
you're going to have to wait
until he comes off his meds

00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:29,534
in about 12 to 24 hours.

00:14:29,601 --> 00:14:31,770
( <i>sighing</i> )

00:14:38,009 --> 00:14:41,746
Tan lines, no watch
and no ring.

00:14:41,813 --> 00:14:44,482
Check his personal effects.

00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:56,628
That must have been
one hell of a fall

00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:58,897
to knock his watch
and his ring off...

00:14:58,964 --> 00:15:01,366
and take his money.

00:15:04,469 --> 00:15:05,670
So what do you say?

00:15:05,737 --> 00:15:08,373
Do you want to up the stakes

00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,474
another hundred?

00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,743
To what, a deuce?

00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:15,146
Say my foul play
against your phantom driver?

00:15:15,213 --> 00:15:17,449
You bet.

00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:20,552
Sanders:
Okay...

00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:23,922
I've got Stuart Rampler's
DNA profile ready.

00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:27,092
All I need is something
to compare it to.

00:15:27,158 --> 00:15:28,593
Coming right up.

00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:33,832
Let's see if we can find out
who this licker is.

00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:47,012
What do you got?

00:15:47,078 --> 00:15:49,948
Well, according to the DNA

00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:53,285
Stuart Rampler licked
the right-side-up stamps.

00:15:53,351 --> 00:15:55,820
What about the envelope
with the upside-down stamp?

00:15:55,887 --> 00:15:57,656
Well, it came back
unknown.

00:15:57,722 --> 00:16:01,126
He's toying with us.

00:16:01,192 --> 00:16:02,193
Who?

00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:05,263
Anonymous.

00:16:10,969 --> 00:16:13,038
Superglueing the entire car?

00:16:13,104 --> 00:16:15,473
It's a little excessive,
don't you think?

00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,474
Hey, man, this is war.

00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:19,311
( <i>chuckling</i> ):
You know, I checked

00:16:19,377 --> 00:16:21,980
with six different medical
centers, and no phantom driver

00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:22,981
at any of them.

00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:24,082
Minor setback.

00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,684
How about the 911 call?

00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,353
Las Vegas cell phone.
PD's putting a name to it.

00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,421
Good.

00:16:29,487 --> 00:16:31,690
What's all this?

00:16:31,756 --> 00:16:33,725
The car was rented
from the airport three days ago.

00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:34,826
To...?

00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:36,261
Walter Bangler.

00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,663
I figure Vegas
vacation;

00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:40,498
side trip to Hoover Dam.

00:16:40,565 --> 00:16:41,266
Makes sense.

00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,267
Mm-hmm.

00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:45,604
You find his watch and ring?

00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:48,006
No.

00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:49,374
( <i>laughing</i> )

00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:51,076
My pockets are getting fat!

00:16:51,142 --> 00:16:52,544
Well, he travels light.

00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:55,080
There was only a change of
clothes in the damn suitcase.

00:16:55,146 --> 00:16:56,514
God, you see all that money
in there?

00:16:56,581 --> 00:16:59,184
All right, the fumes have
settled. Give me a hand.

00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,652
Yeah.

00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,928
( <i>coughing</i> )

00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:15,667
You can run...

00:17:17,235 --> 00:17:19,638
but you can't hide.

00:17:21,873 --> 00:17:23,642
"Disco Placid"--
what's that?

00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:24,843
He's a jazz producer.

00:17:24,909 --> 00:17:26,044
He specializes in audio.

00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:28,413
He does voice comparisons
for me from time to time.

00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,614
He hears in perfect pitch.

00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:30,615
Really?

00:17:30,682 --> 00:17:32,017
He's gifted.

Got it right here.

00:18:10,922 --> 00:18:13,058
All I got to do is,
uh, heat this thing up.

00:18:17,562 --> 00:18:21,299
It's a mini-cassette recording
of your first victim.

00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:24,369
I'm going to kill myself.

00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:25,704
I'm comparing
the "I love yous..."

00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:30,475
I just can't do it anymore...
I love you, Mom...

00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:33,578
Now the talking frame.

00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:39,184
Well, now you can listen to it

The mother was wrong.
That <i>is</i> her son's voice.

00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,390
I laid in both

00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:49,060
suicide notes in the computer,
stripped the tracks one by one.

00:18:49,127 --> 00:18:52,931
Picked this up in the b-ground.

00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:56,034
( <i>crinkling in background):</i>
My name is Royce Harmon.

00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:58,870
I reside

00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:00,739
Las Vegas, Nevada.

00:19:00,805 --> 00:19:01,940
I am 41 years of age.

00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:04,376
What is that?

00:19:04,442 --> 00:19:06,211
I don't know. It sounds like

00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:09,214
a flag or a tarp
or something.

00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:11,516
Give me a sec. I'll give it
to you in a Chinese to-go box.

00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:12,951
Play the second victim's tape.

00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:16,354
Okay.

00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:18,757
My name is Stuart Rampler.

00:19:18,823 --> 00:19:21,860
I reside at 818 Boeing Hill

00:19:21,926 --> 00:19:22,861
( <i>tape stops</i> )

00:19:22,927 --> 00:19:25,497
No. Play it through.

00:19:25,563 --> 00:19:26,998
...Nevada.

00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:30,135
I am 43 years of age,
and I'm going to kill myself.

00:19:30,201 --> 00:19:32,404
Play them side by side.

00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:35,373
Both:
My name is

00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,575
Royce Harmon.
Stuart Rampler.

00:19:37,642 --> 00:19:39,544
I reside at
818 Boeing Hill
7642 Carpenter Street.

00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:41,046
Both:
Las Vegas, Nevada.


00:19:41,112 --> 00:19:43,815
Both:
I am 41/43 years of age.


00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:45,483
It's "fill in the blanks."


00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:47,052
He's just reading
from a suicide script.


00:19:47,118 --> 00:19:50,055
( <i>crinkling</i> )


00:19:50,121 --> 00:19:52,724
What do you think?

00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,560
Disco.

00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:59,297
So I've got some good news
and mysterious news.

00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:00,899
Give me the good news.

00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:03,435
Well, your results are back
from the prints on the car

00:20:03,501 --> 00:20:05,604
and your vic Walter Bangler's
top on the list.

00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:07,238
It's a big list.

00:20:07,305 --> 00:20:08,673
You fumed the entire car.

00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,041
What'd you expect?

00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:11,776
What's the mysterious news?

00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:13,278
I found some speckles
of blue dust

00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:15,814
in the ridges
of Bangler's print.

00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,881
Here. Look.

00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:22,887
Let me see.

00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,125
What do you think?

00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:31,930
I have no idea.

00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:33,999
I did some comparative digging
on both victims--

00:20:34,065 --> 00:20:36,134
Royce Harmon and Stuart Rampler.

00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:39,004
Both are white males
in their 40s, single

00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:41,172
<i>and...</i> both have
the same birthday.

00:20:41,239 --> 00:20:45,677
Royce Harmon,
born August 17, 1958.

00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:50,548
Stuart Rampler,
born August 17, 1957.

00:20:50,615 --> 00:20:52,984
One year apart.

00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:56,488
Okay, so maybe it's some
reversed or backwards pattern.

00:20:56,554 --> 00:20:58,356
August 17, 1958...

00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:01,960
1957. The suicide message
was recorded backwards;

00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:03,595
the postage stamp
was upside-down...

00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:05,630
Yeah?

00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:08,433
Maybe he's telling us
in order to go forward, go back.

00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,634
Sara, go back

00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:11,036
one more year--

00:21:11,102 --> 00:21:12,470
August 17, 1956.

00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:15,040
See if anything pops up
with the same MO.

00:21:15,106 --> 00:21:16,942
I'm gone.

00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:21,379
Mr. Grissom, the prints are back

00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,248
from Stuart Rampler's
mini-recorder.

00:21:26,518 --> 00:21:27,953
Can we see the print?

00:21:28,019 --> 00:21:29,087
Not print-- prints.

00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:29,988
What do you mean--

00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:31,289
It's more than
one person?

00:21:31,356 --> 00:21:33,158
It's two thumbprints
overlapped.

00:21:33,224 --> 00:21:34,159
Can you separate them?

00:21:34,225 --> 00:21:35,393
Yeah.

00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:39,464
Running both prints

00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:41,733
through AFIS.

00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,640
( <i>beeping</i> )

00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:50,742
How can that be?

00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:53,011
"Compliance"?

00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:55,080
Someone within the department?

00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:03,388
What?

00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:07,058
Uh, Catherine, can you excuse us
for a moment?

00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:09,027
I need to speak with
Mr. Grissom in private.

00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:13,431
Anything you have to say to me
you can say to her.

00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:17,202
Well, the top print came back
Paul Millander.

00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:18,570
I expected that.

00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:20,005
He's the guy who makes
the rubber hands.

00:22:20,071 --> 00:22:21,106
I've already cleared him.

00:22:21,172 --> 00:22:23,975
What about the compliance--
the bottom print?

00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:25,910
It came back you.

00:22:28,913 --> 00:22:30,482
It's Grissom's print?

00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:35,253
Wait a minute.

00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,022
Somebody got a hold
of your prints.

00:22:37,088 --> 00:22:38,156
How?

00:22:38,223 --> 00:22:39,758
I wear gloves
at every crime scene.

00:22:39,824 --> 00:22:41,626
I was printed for the job.
We all were.

00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,928
Well, somebody's obviously
making this personal.

00:22:43,995 --> 00:22:45,463
They could've gotten your print

00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,632
from a glass that you touched
at a restaurant

00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:50,101
or from a latex glove
that you discarded

00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:51,870
and they turned
inside out...

00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:54,272
( <i>sighing</i> ):
Oh, God...

00:22:56,942 --> 00:22:57,943
I get it.

00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:04,186
Whoever it is is telling me that
he's got me under his thumb.

00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:19,133
So... who's your

00:23:19,199 --> 00:23:20,134
phantom driver?

00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,537
Possibly a cop from Philly.

00:23:23,604 --> 00:23:27,274
Or a, a nurse from Omaha.

00:23:27,341 --> 00:23:29,443
Don't forget the mail carrier
from Nashville.

00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:30,978
Man, it's a rental.

00:23:31,045 --> 00:23:33,447
Those prints are probably older
than you are.

00:23:33,514 --> 00:23:34,815
Well, this is going nowhere.

00:23:34,882 --> 00:23:35,749
You giving up?

00:23:35,816 --> 00:23:37,284
No, no, no, no.

00:23:37,351 --> 00:23:38,419
We're still on.

00:23:38,485 --> 00:23:40,955
I may be stalled,
but I'm not out.

00:23:41,021 --> 00:23:42,323
You want to take it
to three?

00:23:42,389 --> 00:23:44,425
<i>You</i> want to take it
to three?

00:23:47,895 --> 00:23:49,363
You still think
he was robbed?

00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:50,664
Tan lines where his ring

00:23:50,731 --> 00:23:52,099
and watch used to be.

00:23:52,166 --> 00:23:54,969
On vacation in Vegas,
but no money in his wallet.

00:23:55,035 --> 00:23:58,539
His face all bruised up before
he took that cliffside tumble.

00:23:58,606 --> 00:24:00,608
Damn right, I think
he was robbed.

00:24:12,486 --> 00:24:13,954
Are you all right, man?

00:24:14,021 --> 00:24:15,389
Yeah...

00:24:15,456 --> 00:24:17,324
Yeah, I guess so.

00:24:17,391 --> 00:24:18,892
I want the ring, the watch

00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:20,160
and all your cash.

00:24:20,227 --> 00:24:21,295
Okay, all right.

00:24:21,362 --> 00:24:22,396
Come on...

00:24:22,463 --> 00:24:23,497
All right, all right.

00:24:25,065 --> 00:24:26,567
Now get your ass
in the back.

00:24:26,634 --> 00:24:28,068
What?

00:24:28,135 --> 00:24:30,137
I said get your
ass in the back!

00:24:34,141 --> 00:24:35,175
Strap in.

00:24:35,242 --> 00:24:36,610
Okay.

00:24:43,584 --> 00:24:45,619
He lays in wait.
He robs him.

00:24:45,686 --> 00:24:49,189
He tries to kill him,
but he lets him buckle in?

00:24:49,256 --> 00:24:51,125
I don't think the robber
expected Bangler

00:24:51,191 --> 00:24:52,726
to get drunk
and go crash his car.

00:24:52,793 --> 00:24:54,995
He probably freaked
and put him in the back seat

00:24:55,062 --> 00:24:57,398
trying to fool me into thinking
someone else was driving.

00:24:57,464 --> 00:24:58,932
But he only fooled you.

00:25:01,001 --> 00:25:02,703
What about the blue
dust, Warrick?

00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:03,737
What about it?

00:25:03,804 --> 00:25:05,172
Don't you think
it matters?

00:25:05,239 --> 00:25:06,674
Maybe.

00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:10,678
But there's other questions
to answer first.

00:25:10,744 --> 00:25:13,213
Okay, like?

00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,449
Footprints and tire tracks.

00:25:15,516 --> 00:25:17,584
I hate you.

00:25:17,651 --> 00:25:18,852
You love me.

00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:20,220
Who you kidding?

00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:48,082
Mr. Millander?

00:25:48,148 --> 00:25:51,318
Hey, it's the
forensics guy.

00:25:51,385 --> 00:25:55,089
I forgot your name.
I-I'm sorry.

00:25:55,155 --> 00:25:56,223
Gil Grissom.

00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:57,291
Hi, Mr. Grissom.

00:25:57,358 --> 00:25:58,659
It's been a couple
of months.

00:25:58,726 --> 00:26:00,260
How are you, sir?

00:26:00,327 --> 00:26:01,462
I'm okay.

00:26:01,528 --> 00:26:02,596
What are you making?

00:26:02,663 --> 00:26:05,966
I-I-I call it...

00:26:06,033 --> 00:26:08,102
"Good versus Evil."

00:26:08,168 --> 00:26:09,903
You like it?

00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:13,240
Yeah, it reminds me
of our supervisor on days.

00:26:13,307 --> 00:26:18,145
So, what brings you down
to my humble abode?

00:26:18,212 --> 00:26:19,747
I have a couple
of questions

00:26:19,813 --> 00:26:21,782
regarding that
staged suicide.

00:26:21,849 --> 00:26:23,317
Remember?

00:26:23,384 --> 00:26:26,320
Yeah, how's
that going?

00:26:26,387 --> 00:26:28,122
Not too well.

00:26:30,724 --> 00:26:34,828
Say, w-would you like
a cup of coffee?

00:26:34,895 --> 00:26:36,297
I got instant.

00:26:36,363 --> 00:26:37,731
Sure.

00:26:48,842 --> 00:26:51,278
I envy you,
Mr. Millander.

00:26:51,345 --> 00:26:53,213
I do.

00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:57,818
You can work by yourself...
no one around to bother you.

00:26:57,885 --> 00:26:59,954
You just...

00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:02,890
do what you do.

00:27:02,957 --> 00:27:05,359
I'd love to have
that kind of autonomy.

00:27:05,426 --> 00:27:07,494
It's really all I know.

00:27:07,561 --> 00:27:08,996
I...

00:27:09,063 --> 00:27:11,432
started out doing ice carvings

00:27:11,498 --> 00:27:13,834
but the artwork never lasted.

00:27:13,901 --> 00:27:14,969
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:27:15,035 --> 00:27:16,670
I know what you mean.

00:27:16,737 --> 00:27:17,972
Thank you.

00:27:18,038 --> 00:27:20,307
Let's sit.

00:27:24,044 --> 00:27:25,646
How can I help you?

00:27:25,713 --> 00:27:28,482
Do you remember the,
uh, rubber hand mold

00:27:28,549 --> 00:27:30,751
that you made
from your own hand?

00:27:30,818 --> 00:27:32,720
How could I forget?

00:27:32,786 --> 00:27:34,555
Well, whoever
the perpetrator is

00:27:34,622 --> 00:27:36,023
has killed again.

00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:37,758
And again, your
print came up.

00:27:37,825 --> 00:27:39,994
So I was hoping
you could help me.

00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,495
Sure.

00:27:41,562 --> 00:27:43,163
The last time we talked

00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:46,900
you told me that you had sold
several thousand units

00:27:46,967 --> 00:27:47,935
last Halloween?

00:27:48,002 --> 00:27:50,170
Bestseller, yes, sir.

00:27:50,237 --> 00:27:53,040
Could you provide me with
a list of your distributors?

00:27:53,107 --> 00:27:57,678
I really don't
have a list.

00:27:57,745 --> 00:27:59,346
Why?

00:27:59,413 --> 00:28:01,849
I was hoping to do
a credit card search...

00:28:01,915 --> 00:28:05,019
go back ten days before
the first murder occurred...

00:28:05,085 --> 00:28:08,122
try and run some names...
see if any priors pop up.

00:28:08,188 --> 00:28:13,327
I would <i>really</i> love to help you,
Mr. Grissom, but...

00:28:13,394 --> 00:28:16,297
I just don't keep track

00:28:16,363 --> 00:28:19,233
of, of individual
purchasers.

00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:22,469
I-I-I'm just a wholesaler.

00:28:22,536 --> 00:28:25,139
I don't, I don't
crunch numbers.

00:28:25,205 --> 00:28:29,743
I-I just... spook the children.

00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:32,513
Of course you do.

00:28:34,548 --> 00:28:36,717
I'm sure you
do it well.

00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:44,425
Finally...

00:28:46,427 --> 00:28:50,030
Hey, partner, did
you get a match yet?

00:28:50,097 --> 00:28:52,766
Ooh, Converse
All-Star.

00:28:52,833 --> 00:28:53,867
Size 11.

00:28:53,934 --> 00:28:55,502
And you needed all
the books for that?

00:28:55,569 --> 00:28:58,105
Those soles have been
around 20 years.

00:28:58,172 --> 00:29:00,007
I needed to be sure.

00:29:00,074 --> 00:29:01,442
You look tired, buddy.

00:29:01,508 --> 00:29:03,444
You want me to make you
a bottle, go nigh-nigh?

00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:05,679
You want me to clack that jaw,
make you go nigh-nigh?

00:29:05,746 --> 00:29:07,881
You should have worked
the tire tracks.

00:29:07,948 --> 00:29:11,218
Jimmy in Trace put together
a digital catalog of treads...

00:29:11,285 --> 00:29:12,486
has thousands on file.

00:29:12,553 --> 00:29:13,854
Took me three minutes.

00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:19,059
Pirelli Low Profile P-Zeros.

00:29:19,126 --> 00:29:20,761
High performance.

00:29:20,828 --> 00:29:23,964
And standard on your
alleged getaway vehicle...

00:29:24,031 --> 00:29:26,300
the '99 Bentley Arnage,
Red Label.

00:29:26,367 --> 00:29:28,702
It's a sweet ride, man,
hand-crafted.

00:29:28,769 --> 00:29:30,337
So, how many people in Vegas

00:29:30,404 --> 00:29:32,873
do you think drive
that kind of price tag?

00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,441
Three.

00:29:34,508 --> 00:29:35,776
Did a DMV search.

00:29:35,843 --> 00:29:37,044
Any reported stolen?

00:29:37,111 --> 00:29:38,379
Yeah, one, last week.

00:29:38,445 --> 00:29:40,447
It came in a couple
of hours ago.

00:29:40,514 --> 00:29:41,949
Take a look.

00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:44,084
Oh-ho!

00:29:44,151 --> 00:29:46,020
So sweet!

00:29:49,723 --> 00:29:51,925
Check this.

00:29:51,992 --> 00:29:53,594
One-to-one says
that's the car.

00:29:53,661 --> 00:29:54,595
Yeah, well, don't bet

00:29:54,662 --> 00:29:56,864
the sub shop, Warrick.

00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:58,966
That's all the evidence
you'll get from the Bentley.

00:29:59,033 --> 00:30:01,135
We found it at a car wash
off Warm Springs.

00:30:01,201 --> 00:30:02,269
It's been vacuumed...

00:30:02,336 --> 00:30:03,938
detailed, the
whole works.

00:30:04,004 --> 00:30:05,739
It's cleaner
than brand-new.

00:30:05,806 --> 00:30:08,742
Well, I wish Bangler's
rental car company

00:30:08,809 --> 00:30:10,878
were as considerate
as your thief.

00:30:10,945 --> 00:30:12,212
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:30:13,614 --> 00:30:15,149
Dr. Livingston.

00:30:15,215 --> 00:30:17,785
Your dead man is making
cash withdrawals.

00:30:17,851 --> 00:30:18,919
Which one?

00:30:18,986 --> 00:30:20,454
The first victim or the second?

00:30:20,521 --> 00:30:22,189
The second, Stuart Rampler.

00:30:22,256 --> 00:30:23,857
The bank called.

00:30:23,924 --> 00:30:25,893
His ATM card showed
a couple of withdrawals

00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,528
<i>after</i> his time of death.

00:30:27,594 --> 00:30:31,265
ATM machines take photographs
every three seconds.

00:30:31,332 --> 00:30:34,535
Maybe we can get a Kodak moment
of this guy.

00:30:34,601 --> 00:30:36,370
I want the machine here.

00:30:36,437 --> 00:30:39,840
I want prints. I want film.
I want everything.

00:30:39,907 --> 00:30:41,041
The whole machine?

00:30:41,108 --> 00:30:42,343
Yeah, the whole machine.

00:30:42,409 --> 00:30:44,378
Okay.

00:31:01,595 --> 00:31:04,431
You got his clothes?

00:31:04,498 --> 00:31:05,799
That's right.

00:31:05,866 --> 00:31:08,068
What are you doing?
His laundry?

00:31:08,135 --> 00:31:10,404
Something to compare
our mystery blue dust to.

00:31:10,471 --> 00:31:12,339
Ah.

00:31:12,406 --> 00:31:15,509
So... what's the pot up to?

00:31:15,576 --> 00:31:16,944
We don't bet on cases.

00:31:17,011 --> 00:31:19,813
Ah, of course you don't.

00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,849
So, who's winning?

00:31:21,915 --> 00:31:24,685
I am.
I am.

00:31:24,752 --> 00:31:26,587
Fiends.

00:31:35,829 --> 00:31:38,399
Your mystery dust is...

00:31:38,465 --> 00:31:40,834
silicon blue dye.

00:31:40,901 --> 00:31:43,137
What's that?

00:31:43,203 --> 00:31:47,374
Pool cue chalk.

00:31:47,441 --> 00:31:50,244
Bangler's shooting stick
with the phantom driver...

00:31:50,311 --> 00:31:52,813
tosses a few back...
piles into the rental...

00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,482
...I-93, Hoover Dam.

00:31:55,549 --> 00:31:57,384
But don't drink
and drive.

00:31:57,451 --> 00:32:00,120
You might spill your drink...
car skids...

00:32:00,187 --> 00:32:01,889
<i>bangs</i> into the railing...

00:32:01,956 --> 00:32:04,258
see-saws...

00:32:04,325 --> 00:32:05,793
on the edge...

00:32:05,859 --> 00:32:07,161
What does the driver do?

00:32:07,227 --> 00:32:08,495
Man, he bails.

00:32:08,562 --> 00:32:10,898
He leaves Bangler
in the back seat

00:32:10,965 --> 00:32:12,132
to take the fall.

00:32:13,801 --> 00:32:14,835
Literally.

00:32:17,004 --> 00:32:20,808
Fingerprints, grooves,
footprints:

00:32:20,874 --> 00:32:23,911
all the bases are covered.

00:32:23,978 --> 00:32:26,847
Victim, suspect, crime scene.

00:32:26,914 --> 00:32:28,983
Like a laxative...

00:32:29,049 --> 00:32:31,118
it works.

00:32:35,623 --> 00:32:37,458
Bangler shooting stick,
I'll give you that.

00:32:37,524 --> 00:32:39,693
Burping bourbons,
I'll give you that, too.

00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,262
But he left <i>solo.</i>

00:32:42,329 --> 00:32:46,734
A few miles down the road,
Bentley thief flags him down...

00:32:48,268 --> 00:32:49,603
spooks him into a skid...

00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:50,838
boom, crash!

00:32:51,739 --> 00:32:52,806
He's robbed...

00:32:52,873 --> 00:32:54,275
forced into the back...

00:32:54,341 --> 00:32:56,677
pushed over the edge.

00:33:00,347 --> 00:33:01,615
With Bangler out of the way

00:33:01,682 --> 00:33:03,550
the thief gets
in his stolen Bentley...

00:33:03,617 --> 00:33:05,819
hightails it
out of there.

00:33:05,886 --> 00:33:06,954
No watch...

00:33:07,021 --> 00:33:08,922
no rings, no cash...

00:33:08,989 --> 00:33:14,128
stolen Bentley tire treads,
Converse All-Star size 11...

00:33:14,194 --> 00:33:17,398
all bases covered.

00:33:17,464 --> 00:33:21,535
Victim, suspect, crime scene.

00:33:21,602 --> 00:33:24,405
And like a canary... it sings.

00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:32,980
You know, I hate to admit it...

00:33:33,047 --> 00:33:35,382
but I like your theory.

00:33:35,449 --> 00:33:36,817
It does work.

00:33:36,884 --> 00:33:39,787
I was sitting here
thinking the same thing

00:33:39,853 --> 00:33:41,722
about your phantom driver.

00:33:41,789 --> 00:33:43,490
So, what do you think?

00:33:43,557 --> 00:33:46,393
Can two solid theories,
each backed by evidence

00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:48,429
both be correct?

00:33:55,302 --> 00:33:57,004
Grissom:
Yeah, there's our guy...

00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:14,188
Life...

00:34:14,254 --> 00:34:16,924
like holding a dove.

00:34:16,991 --> 00:34:21,428
You hold it too hard...

00:34:21,495 --> 00:34:22,796
you kill it.

00:34:22,863 --> 00:34:24,031
Hold it too soft...

00:34:24,098 --> 00:34:25,165
...and it'll fly away.

00:34:30,671 --> 00:34:32,406
Catherine:
Have we located this bum?

00:34:32,473 --> 00:34:35,209
Brass's guys are
looking for him.

00:34:35,276 --> 00:34:40,080
Okay... significance
of the flipping?

00:34:40,147 --> 00:34:42,049
He's obviously
making a point.

00:34:42,116 --> 00:34:43,984
What does the dove symbolize?
Peace.

00:34:44,051 --> 00:34:47,588
But I don't think
it's peace in terms of...

00:34:47,655 --> 00:34:49,556
of human civility or unrest.

00:34:49,623 --> 00:34:51,959
I think maybe
it's "peace of mind."

00:34:52,026 --> 00:34:54,662
What do you
have to attain

00:34:54,728 --> 00:34:57,131
to have peace of mind?

00:34:58,866 --> 00:35:01,068
Justice.

00:35:04,271 --> 00:35:07,241
"I'm going to keep doing
this over and over again

00:35:07,308 --> 00:35:08,870
until I get justice."

00:35:19,412 --> 00:35:21,047
( <i>door closes</i> )

00:35:21,114 --> 00:35:22,048
Hi.

00:35:22,115 --> 00:35:23,516
How you doing?
Hmm.

00:35:23,583 --> 00:35:24,851
How'd you find him?

00:35:24,918 --> 00:35:28,121
We canvassed a square-mile
radius of the ATM machine.

00:35:28,188 --> 00:35:30,357
Started throwing bums
hamburgers out the window

00:35:30,423 --> 00:35:31,691
in a nice tight spiral.

00:35:31,758 --> 00:35:34,995
He ratted him out
in 20 minutes.

00:35:36,763 --> 00:35:39,332
You want to tell him
how you were approached?

00:35:39,399 --> 00:35:42,569
You know, I think better
when I eat.

00:35:42,636 --> 00:35:43,903
No kidding?

00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:46,039
Jim, call
The Steak House
at Circus.

00:35:46,106 --> 00:35:47,707
Get this fellow
a porterhouse.

00:35:50,143 --> 00:35:52,245
How do you like it,
medium rare or...

00:35:52,312 --> 00:35:55,582
no, you look like
a well-done kind of guy.

00:35:55,649 --> 00:35:56,683
Rare.

00:36:06,092 --> 00:36:08,094
Two minutes,
understand?

00:36:08,161 --> 00:36:10,096
That's all we'll need.

00:36:12,799 --> 00:36:16,169
Hey, how are you feeling,
Mr. Bangler?

00:36:16,236 --> 00:36:19,005
Uh, better, I guess.

00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:21,441
I understand last night
was exciting, though.

00:36:21,508 --> 00:36:23,410
Yeah.
I'm going to come
right out and say it.

00:36:23,476 --> 00:36:25,178
What happened to you
is not right.

00:36:25,245 --> 00:36:28,081
The person responsible needs
to be brought to justice.

00:36:28,148 --> 00:36:29,716
You tell me
who that person is.

00:36:29,783 --> 00:36:31,418
Who was driving that car?

00:36:31,484 --> 00:36:33,219
Who the hell are you guys?

00:36:33,286 --> 00:36:35,188
I'm Warrick.
I'm Nick.

00:36:35,255 --> 00:36:36,523
I'm Nick Stokes.

00:36:36,589 --> 00:36:37,891
This is Warrick Brown.

00:36:37,958 --> 00:36:39,526
We're with Criminalistics.

00:36:39,592 --> 00:36:41,061
We've been working
your accident.

00:36:41,127 --> 00:36:42,462
Actually, sir,
I-I don't think

00:36:42,529 --> 00:36:43,496
it was an accident.

00:36:43,563 --> 00:36:44,598
I think you were robbed

00:36:44,664 --> 00:36:46,700
and any information
that you remember

00:36:46,766 --> 00:36:47,934
about your attacker

00:36:48,001 --> 00:36:49,603
would be
very helpful.

00:36:49,669 --> 00:36:50,971
I wasn't attacked.

00:36:52,505 --> 00:36:54,574
I was drunk...

00:36:54,641 --> 00:36:56,810
really drunk.

00:36:56,876 --> 00:36:59,846
No way I should've been driving
that car.

00:36:59,913 --> 00:37:01,448
( <i>ball clacks</i> )

00:37:05,118 --> 00:37:06,620
Yeah!

00:37:09,389 --> 00:37:11,124
I guess that's enough for me.

00:37:11,191 --> 00:37:12,559
Then it's time to pay up.

00:37:14,127 --> 00:37:17,430
Looks like I'm a little short.

00:37:17,497 --> 00:37:18,765
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:37:18,832 --> 00:37:20,100
Hit him.

00:37:20,166 --> 00:37:21,067
No, wait.

00:37:21,134 --> 00:37:22,502

( <i>tires squealing</i> )

00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:49,996
You mean you got hustled?

00:37:50,063 --> 00:37:51,998
I won the first game.

00:37:52,065 --> 00:37:55,201
You climbed in the back seat
yourself?

00:37:55,268 --> 00:37:56,703
Yeah.

00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:59,773
So buckling up...
really did save your life.

00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:01,107
You know that?

00:38:01,174 --> 00:38:03,643
Yeah, I guess it did.

00:38:04,878 --> 00:38:06,546
You get well, okay?

00:38:06,613 --> 00:38:08,415
Glad we could help.

00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:13,386
Well, the only thing
we didn't factor in
was his will to live.

00:38:13,453 --> 00:38:15,455
And the Bentley thief,
size 11--

00:38:15,522 --> 00:38:17,757
he could've been
at that crime scene

00:38:17,824 --> 00:38:19,159
anytime last week.

00:38:20,393 --> 00:38:23,063
So we push
on the bet?

00:38:23,129 --> 00:38:24,965
No winner?

00:38:25,031 --> 00:38:26,733
No loser.

00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,635
( <i>pager beeping</i> )

00:38:31,204 --> 00:38:32,839
406, burglary.

00:38:32,906 --> 00:38:35,408
Double or nothing?

00:38:35,475 --> 00:38:37,711
You're talking
to the wrong guy.

00:38:42,282 --> 00:38:45,051
Brass:
Can we start
again, please?

00:38:45,118 --> 00:38:48,254
Now, how did this man
approach you?

00:38:48,321 --> 00:38:49,689
He walked up to me.

00:38:49,756 --> 00:38:51,591
Told me he'd give me
a hundred bucks

00:38:51,658 --> 00:38:52,759
if I flip some cards.

00:38:52,826 --> 00:38:54,094
He pay you cash?

00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,862
Mm-hmm. A hundred-dollar bill.

00:38:55,929 --> 00:38:57,764
You still have it?

00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,769
How tall was this man?

00:39:04,804 --> 00:39:10,977
Was he... shorter or taller
than Mr. Brass here?

00:39:13,313 --> 00:39:14,848
A hair taller.

00:39:14,914 --> 00:39:18,218
By a hair, do you mean
the hair of a rabbit

00:39:18,285 --> 00:39:20,387
or the hair
of grizzly bear?

00:39:20,453 --> 00:39:23,156
Somewhere in the middle.

00:39:25,358 --> 00:39:27,627
Okay.

00:39:27,694 --> 00:39:29,496
Let's say he was 5'10".

00:39:29,562 --> 00:39:32,399
What else do you remember
about this man?

00:39:32,465 --> 00:39:35,068
He had a narrow chin.

00:39:35,135 --> 00:39:37,938
Uh... his eyes were blue

00:39:38,004 --> 00:39:42,008
deep-sea blue, you know?

00:39:42,075 --> 00:39:43,109
Uh, jet-black hair

00:39:43,176 --> 00:39:45,979
Uh, Spock-like ears

00:39:46,046 --> 00:39:48,214
pointed nose, bushy eyebrows.

00:39:48,281 --> 00:39:50,283
Sunken cheeks

00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:52,819
with a bad complexion,
almost pockfaced.

00:39:54,187 --> 00:39:57,390
Uh, thin
as a soda cracker

00:39:57,457 --> 00:39:58,992
and his clothes

00:39:59,059 --> 00:40:02,495
were wrinkled,
like, uh, he slept in them.

00:40:02,562 --> 00:40:05,065
And when he spoke,
he spoke with a...

00:40:05,131 --> 00:40:07,100
Stutter.

00:40:08,101 --> 00:40:09,302
Yeah.

00:40:10,637 --> 00:40:12,539
Paul Millander.

00:40:14,874 --> 00:40:16,743
He set me up.

00:40:18,111 --> 00:40:19,613
Son of a bitch!

00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:21,081
I had him

00:40:21,147 --> 00:40:22,649
and I let him go!

00:40:22,716 --> 00:40:25,051
You ever make
any rubber hands?

00:40:25,118 --> 00:40:27,554
I sold 10,000
of those units
last Halloween

00:40:27,621 --> 00:40:30,590
even used my own hand
for the mold.

00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:34,961
So when I picked
up the hand

00:40:35,028 --> 00:40:36,329
he must've lifted
my print.

00:40:36,396 --> 00:40:38,531
Latex rubber surface,
freshly dried paint

00:40:38,598 --> 00:40:39,699
a snip of scotch tape--

00:40:39,766 --> 00:40:42,002
it wouldn't be that hard
to lift and replant.

00:40:42,068 --> 00:40:43,236

just keep trying.

00:41:27,347 --> 00:41:30,283
I got something out
of the newspaper index.

00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:31,484
What is it?

00:41:31,551 --> 00:41:33,753
"Two hotel security guards
exonerated

00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:35,622
"in alleged 'staged' suicide.

00:41:35,689 --> 00:41:37,624
Boy's testimony shaky."

00:41:37,691 --> 00:41:39,826
"Paul Millander, age ten,
testified

00:41:39,893 --> 00:41:43,229
"that he watched in the closet
while his father, John

00:41:43,296 --> 00:41:45,966
"was escorted
by two hotel security guards

00:41:46,032 --> 00:41:48,101
"into his own bathtub
at gunpoint

00:41:48,168 --> 00:41:50,303
"where he was found
shot to death.

00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:53,239
Official cause of death
was ruled..."

00:41:53,306 --> 00:41:54,474
Suicide.

00:41:54,541 --> 00:41:55,809
Check the date.

00:41:55,875 --> 00:41:57,143
( <i>keyboard clacking</i> )

00:41:58,478 --> 00:42:00,513
Catherine, you were right.

00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:01,848
August 17, 1959

00:42:01,915 --> 00:42:03,183
it's a pattern.

00:42:03,249 --> 00:42:05,719
So he was killing men
who were born on the same day

00:42:05,785 --> 00:42:07,120
that his father died.

00:42:15,829 --> 00:42:17,931
( <i>sirens blaring</i> )

00:42:27,207 --> 00:42:29,309
( <i>metal clanking</i> )

00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,789
All clear.

00:43:21,494 --> 00:43:24,564
Blank. What's that mean?

00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:29,603
We have nothing.

00:43:35,775 --> 00:43:37,377
Man:
Mr. Grissom in?

00:43:37,444 --> 00:43:39,045
No, he's out on assignment.

00:43:42,816 --> 00:43:44,784
Do you want to leave him
a message?

00:43:44,851 --> 00:43:47,487
No. Just tell him a friend
stopped by.

00:43:47,554 --> 00:43:50,116
A friend?

00:43:50,116 --> 00:43:51,175
A friend. He'll know.
