00:10:59,315 --> 00:11:00,449
What are you doing?

00:11:00,449 --> 00:11:02,786
Checking for blood spatter.

00:11:02,786 --> 00:11:04,354
What blood?
Am I a suspect?

00:11:04,354 --> 00:11:06,090
This is what I do.

00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:08,126
This is how I eliminate you
as a suspect.

00:11:19,773 --> 00:11:21,910
I’ll take that
for you.

00:11:27,817 --> 00:11:31,254
Well, that’s good news;
no blood, bud.

00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,301
I am gonna need you
to strip, though.

00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:44,671
Right here?

00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:45,873
Don’t be shy on my account.

00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:48,209
But if you are,
this nice detective

00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:50,646
will accompany you
to the bedroom.

00:11:50,646 --> 00:11:52,982
Oh, and, uh, I’m going to need

00:11:52,982 --> 00:11:54,517
to take your window
with me too.

00:11:54,517 --> 00:11:57,054
It’s all in the warrant.

00:11:57,054 --> 00:11:58,488
( <i>camera shutter clicks</i> )

00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:03,928
The person who wrote this
is left-handed.

00:12:03,928 --> 00:12:05,497
And we know that because...?

00:12:05,497 --> 00:12:08,501
The "t-bar" in "catch,"
it’s left-tending.

00:12:08,501 --> 00:12:10,336
And uneducated...

00:12:10,336 --> 00:12:13,374
The contraction
in "Iv’e" is misplaced.

00:12:13,374 --> 00:12:16,244
Then we have the large,
arched hood in the letter "Y"

00:12:16,244 --> 00:12:18,146
and the arches
in the bottom of the "Ls."

00:12:18,146 --> 00:12:20,883
This indicates
criminal tendency,

00:12:20,883 --> 00:12:23,119
which is supported
by the heavy pastiosity,

00:12:23,119 --> 00:12:26,290
which suggests
low impulse control.

00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:27,458
Heavy pastiosity?

00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:31,096
The pressure--
how firmly you put pen to paper.

00:12:31,096 --> 00:12:32,831
Or marker to metal.

00:12:34,734 --> 00:12:36,636
Do we know anything else?

00:12:36,636 --> 00:12:37,905
Yes.

00:12:37,905 --> 00:12:39,106
Overall, the handwriting

00:12:39,106 --> 00:12:42,443
is cursive and round.

00:12:42,443 --> 00:12:44,914
This tells me
it was written by a woman.

00:12:56,128 --> 00:12:58,997
( <i>machine rumbling</i> )

00:13:00,299 --> 00:13:02,969
Damn!

00:13:02,969 --> 00:13:06,941
Taking the
whole window.

00:13:06,941 --> 00:13:10,011
Grissom reinstated you.

00:13:10,011 --> 00:13:11,780
And you have a
problem with that.

00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,282
Let me guess.

00:13:13,282 --> 00:13:15,051
Grissom gets you
to dime yourself off

00:13:15,051 --> 00:13:16,253
and now you both feel better?

00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:17,788
You’re supposed
to be in court.

00:13:17,788 --> 00:13:19,890
Instead, you’re placing bets
for a cheap thrill

00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:21,192
to satisfy nothing.

00:13:21,192 --> 00:13:24,363
Hey! This has nothing
to do with you.

00:13:27,032 --> 00:13:29,269
So are we going
to work together?

00:13:29,269 --> 00:13:30,804
Or not?

00:13:30,804 --> 00:13:32,139
I’m already working.

00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,979
( <i>machine rumbling</i> )

00:13:50,461 --> 00:13:53,365
You weren’t
in your office.

00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:55,602
And good morning
to you too, Miss Sidle.

00:13:55,602 --> 00:13:57,304
Warrick has a problem.

00:13:57,304 --> 00:13:59,139
Ignoring it isn’t gonna
make it go away.

00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:00,341
You asked me
for a report

00:14:00,341 --> 00:14:03,545
and then you disregard
my recommendation.

00:14:03,545 --> 00:14:05,014
I read your report.

00:14:05,014 --> 00:14:06,481
So you feel comfortable

00:14:06,481 --> 00:14:08,919
jeopardizing a unit
to placate an addict?

00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:11,455
I see the whole puzzle, Sara.

00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,856
You’re only seeing one piece.

00:14:12,856 --> 00:14:16,361
Then at least take
him off my case.

00:14:16,361 --> 00:14:17,763
No.

00:14:17,763 --> 00:14:19,698
I trust him.

00:14:19,698 --> 00:14:21,768
Do you trust me?

00:14:21,768 --> 00:14:23,370
( <i>door opening</i> )

00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:24,905
Grissom.

00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:26,507
I’ve got something
you want to see.

00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:30,411
( <i>clears throat</i> )

00:14:33,883 --> 00:14:36,719
You know how you’re always
pushing that Holy Trinity stuff?

00:14:36,719 --> 00:14:38,055
Father, Son,
Holy Ghost?

00:14:38,055 --> 00:14:40,023
Victim, suspect,
crime scene.

00:14:40,023 --> 00:14:41,259
That one--oh.

00:14:41,259 --> 00:14:42,827
Right. Well,
we don’t have a victim.

00:14:42,827 --> 00:14:44,028
We don’t have a suspect.

00:14:44,028 --> 00:14:45,230
All we have is
a crime scene--

00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,499
the restroom
at Marty’s Market

00:14:46,499 --> 00:14:48,434
with the message,
"I killed five women."

00:14:48,434 --> 00:14:51,805
So I figured there had
to be four others.

00:14:51,805 --> 00:14:53,708
You found
the other four victims?

00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:56,244
No, I found
the four other crime scenes.

00:14:57,512 --> 00:15:00,783
Brass ran our case
through VICAP.

00:15:00,783 --> 00:15:02,519
I made a few calls.

00:15:08,326 --> 00:15:11,229
"Iv’e killed 1 woman."
Victorville.

00:15:12,664 --> 00:15:14,667
Salt Lake City--
"Iv’e killed 2 women.

00:15:14,667 --> 00:15:17,170
Catch me if you can?"

00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:20,208
San Bernardino--
"Iv’e killed 3 women..."

00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:24,113
"Iv’e killed 4 women.
Catch me!" Mesquite.

00:15:24,113 --> 00:15:27,883
"...5 women... " Las Vegas.

00:15:27,883 --> 00:15:29,085
Five stall doors

00:15:29,085 --> 00:15:31,588
from five
supermarket restrooms.

00:15:31,588 --> 00:15:36,328
Five missing women,
including Margaret Shorey.

00:15:36,328 --> 00:15:38,163
What else do you know
about the crime scenes?

00:15:38,163 --> 00:15:39,498
Just like
Marty’s Market--

00:15:39,498 --> 00:15:41,267
there was no physical evidence
indicating

00:15:41,267 --> 00:15:42,536
that the women
were killed there.

00:15:42,536 --> 00:15:44,104
Which means
they were probably alive

00:15:44,104 --> 00:15:45,773
when these messages
were written,

00:15:45,773 --> 00:15:48,543
making these messages
of intention, not fact.

00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:12,139
What if we shuffle these doors
like pai gow tiles?

00:16:29,094 --> 00:16:31,297
San Bernardino, California.

00:16:31,297 --> 00:16:32,831
Victorville, California.

00:16:32,831 --> 00:16:34,033
Las Vegas, Nevada.

00:16:34,033 --> 00:16:35,234
Mesquite, Nevada.

00:16:35,234 --> 00:16:37,805
Salt Lake City, Utah.

00:16:40,308 --> 00:16:41,843
Interstate 15.

00:16:41,843 --> 00:16:44,279
God knows I’ve driven
it enough times.

00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:46,749
So has our suspect.

00:16:50,821 --> 00:16:53,725
Okay, dude, it’s ready.

00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,294
So this paper should
have soaked up

00:16:56,294 --> 00:16:58,497
any foreign material
on the shirt,

00:16:58,497 --> 00:17:01,267
particularly amylase...

00:17:06,607 --> 00:17:08,343
You know, I’ve done
this procedure

00:17:08,343 --> 00:17:10,145
on jeans
and leather jackets,

00:17:10,145 --> 00:17:13,950
but never on
something like this.

00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,452
It’s very see-through.

00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:17,921
Very Jennifer Lopez.

00:17:17,921 --> 00:17:19,122
Down, boy.

00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:20,324
What can you tell me?

00:17:20,324 --> 00:17:21,525
Is there saliva on it?

00:17:21,525 --> 00:17:23,395
It’s gonna be
a tough one to prove.

00:17:23,395 --> 00:17:24,596
This is only step one.

00:17:24,596 --> 00:17:25,831
You see,
when a person talks,

00:17:25,831 --> 00:17:27,667
saliva naturally comes
out of their mouth.

00:17:27,667 --> 00:17:30,270
Let’s say that we’re tossing
the hog back and forth, right?

00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:31,605
What can you tell me
about the hottie

00:17:31,605 --> 00:17:33,374
that goes
inside this blouse, huh?

00:17:33,374 --> 00:17:36,144
Is it true she’s
a friend of yours?

00:17:36,144 --> 00:17:37,880
What, is it on the Internet?

00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,482
Might as well be.

00:17:39,482 --> 00:17:41,217
Just remember that.

00:17:41,217 --> 00:17:44,221
My saliva’s getting on you;
your saliva’s getting on me.

00:17:44,221 --> 00:17:45,923
Gross.

00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,962
What’s that stuff?

00:17:50,962 --> 00:17:52,664
Starch and iodine.

00:17:52,664 --> 00:17:54,667
If this is saliva,
we’re gonna get

00:17:54,667 --> 00:17:58,238
the ol’ Dalmatian effect.

00:17:58,238 --> 00:18:00,408
So, Nick, if I
wanted to meet

00:18:00,408 --> 00:18:01,810
this friend
of yours...?

00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:03,545
No.

00:18:03,545 --> 00:18:04,980
Figured.

00:18:08,017 --> 00:18:09,820
That’s a pretty big spot.

00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,588
That’s more
than just a spray.

00:18:11,588 --> 00:18:16,394
In fact, looks like
a distinct glob of spit.

00:18:16,394 --> 00:18:19,164
Kristy was telling the truth.

00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:21,667
But it doesn’t mean it was
the security guard’s spit.

00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:23,337
Step three.

00:18:23,337 --> 00:18:25,672
I’m going to need a sample.

00:18:25,672 --> 00:18:27,241
Well, if the guy
knows he did it,

00:18:27,241 --> 00:18:28,944
he’s not gonna
cough it up.

00:18:28,944 --> 00:18:32,314
If you saw the girl
that went with this blouse...

00:18:32,314 --> 00:18:33,716
you’d try.

00:18:35,151 --> 00:18:37,354
You found what
on my pants?

00:18:37,354 --> 00:18:39,390
Glass. Any idea
how it got there?

00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:42,293
Well, it’s just a guess,

00:18:42,293 --> 00:18:44,129
but someone broke
into my car last weekend

00:18:44,129 --> 00:18:46,666
and smashed my window
and made off with my CD player.

00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:48,468
So I must’ve been
wearing those pants.

00:18:48,468 --> 00:18:50,036
Did you file
a police report?

00:18:50,036 --> 00:18:52,606
No, but you can check
with my insurance company.

00:18:52,606 --> 00:18:54,441
I already checked with my lab.

00:18:54,441 --> 00:18:56,611
They do this test,
and guess what?

00:18:56,611 --> 00:18:59,214
The glass--it floated.

00:18:59,214 --> 00:19:01,084
You know what that means?

00:19:01,084 --> 00:19:02,418
No.

00:19:02,418 --> 00:19:04,955
It means the glass
on your pants

00:19:04,955 --> 00:19:07,224
and the glass from
your living room window

00:19:07,224 --> 00:19:09,427
have equal densities.

00:19:09,427 --> 00:19:11,697
Sorry, I was never
very good at science.

00:19:11,697 --> 00:19:15,435
The glass didn’t come
from any car window.

00:19:15,435 --> 00:19:17,004
That’s science.

00:19:17,004 --> 00:19:18,706
Anything else
you’d like to tell us?

00:19:18,706 --> 00:19:21,442
Look, it’s like I told you.

00:19:21,442 --> 00:19:22,777
I walked in the house...

00:19:26,482 --> 00:19:27,950
( <i>rattling</i> )

00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,652
<i>...and I thought,</i>

00:19:29,652 --> 00:19:33,457
"They’re coming back
and they’re gonna kill me too."

00:19:33,457 --> 00:19:36,794
<i>I heard a noise</i>
<i>and I walked to the window.</i>

00:19:36,794 --> 00:19:38,797
That must be when I got
the glass on my pants.

00:19:38,797 --> 00:19:42,502
Look, somebody really did
break into my car, okay?

00:19:42,502 --> 00:19:45,873
And I just remembered
all that stuff just now.

00:19:47,642 --> 00:19:50,111
So am I in trouble?

00:19:52,348 --> 00:19:53,549
You’re free to go.

00:19:53,549 --> 00:19:54,817
No, he’s not.

00:19:54,817 --> 00:19:56,353
We’re not cops;
we can’t hold him.

00:19:56,353 --> 00:19:58,421
Just one more question.

00:19:58,421 --> 00:20:00,324
What do you do
for a living?

00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:01,525
I’m a day trader.

00:20:01,525 --> 00:20:05,264
You make a lot of
money doing that?

00:20:05,264 --> 00:20:06,632
That’s two
questions.

00:20:06,632 --> 00:20:09,502
Feel free to answer
it anyway.

00:20:09,502 --> 00:20:11,004
Yeah, you can.

00:20:14,241 --> 00:20:15,677
But you don’t, right?

00:20:26,156 --> 00:20:28,058
You showed him
all your cards.

00:20:28,058 --> 00:20:29,360
Sucker play.

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,629
I was playing him.

00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:32,264
Cops ran Kenny’s financials.

00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:33,499
He lost a pot
in the market.

00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:35,134
Had a ton of
margin calls.

00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:37,404
I’m surprised you didn’t tag him
as a fellow gambler.

00:20:37,404 --> 00:20:40,674
Oh, you just don’t let up,
do you?

00:20:40,674 --> 00:20:42,010
It’s a flaw.

00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:43,512
I’ll flip you
to see who drives.

00:20:43,512 --> 00:20:44,914
Where we going?

00:20:44,914 --> 00:20:46,115
Moapa.

00:20:46,115 --> 00:20:47,417
What’s in Moapa?

00:20:47,417 --> 00:20:48,818
Besides the I-15?

00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:11,079
So my guys tell me
that your guy Nick

00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:13,482
is helping a working girl
at a five-star

00:21:13,482 --> 00:21:15,084
and it was quite a commotion.

00:21:15,084 --> 00:21:16,386
Really?

00:21:16,386 --> 00:21:19,357
Yeah, and if I know, it means
a lot of other people know.

00:21:19,357 --> 00:21:21,192
People bigger
than you and me.

00:21:21,192 --> 00:21:23,762
A kid from a crime lab
doing favors for a hooker?

00:21:23,762 --> 00:21:25,931
Can’t make the unit
look too good, huh, boss?

00:21:25,931 --> 00:21:27,933
Yeah, well,
I’ll get into it.

00:21:27,933 --> 00:21:31,338
You know, I bet that’s
just what Nicky said.

00:21:31,338 --> 00:21:32,773
You two ladies
done talking?

00:21:32,773 --> 00:21:35,510
It’s hot out here.

00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:36,711
So, a kid over there

00:21:36,711 --> 00:21:38,446
started to
take a leak.

00:21:38,446 --> 00:21:39,782
<i>Found the body.</i>

00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:47,392
Well, it’s
not Margaret.

00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,927
This one’s a blonde.

00:21:48,927 --> 00:21:50,829
And blue.

00:21:53,232 --> 00:21:54,701
This is bizarre.

00:21:54,701 --> 00:21:56,136
The body’s cold.

00:21:56,136 --> 00:21:57,337
In this heat?

00:21:57,337 --> 00:21:59,206
And she’s stiff--

00:21:59,206 --> 00:22:00,241
like a two-minute burrito

00:22:00,241 --> 00:22:03,011
that’s only been
nuked for a minute.

00:22:03,011 --> 00:22:05,881
Meet Joan Sims
from San Bernardino, California.

00:22:05,881 --> 00:22:07,650
We’ve been
getting acquainted.

00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:09,619
Missing woman number one--
disappeared

00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:11,855
from a supermarket restroom
last July.

00:22:11,855 --> 00:22:13,390
Cause of death
was strangulation.

00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:16,528
I found ligature marks
on the wrists and the ankles.

00:22:16,528 --> 00:22:17,730
That was the easy part.

00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:19,231
This one’s weird.

00:22:19,231 --> 00:22:21,768
Like, I-may-use-her-
in-a-lecture weird.

00:22:21,768 --> 00:22:23,737
Her decomp is
completely backwards.

00:22:23,737 --> 00:22:25,205
It’s supposed
to begin on the inside,

00:22:25,205 --> 00:22:27,775
but her organs are
in better shape than her skin.

00:22:27,775 --> 00:22:30,679
Take a look at this.

00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:32,748
I took tissue samples
from her heart.

00:22:37,821 --> 00:22:39,557
GRISSOM:
Looks like the planet Krypton.

00:22:39,557 --> 00:22:41,092
More like Kryptonite.

00:22:41,092 --> 00:22:43,061
Those are actually
ice crystals, Superman.

00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:44,829
You want to know
why she’s blue?

00:22:44,829 --> 00:22:46,699
Cold to the touch
in the middle of the desert?

00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:48,634
This lady was frozen,
kept on ice

00:22:48,634 --> 00:22:50,804
until approximately
12 hours ago.

00:22:55,343 --> 00:22:57,279
I-15?

00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:00,449
Refrigerated?

00:23:00,449 --> 00:23:01,785
That’s how she was transported

00:23:01,785 --> 00:23:03,520
from San Bernardino
to Vegas--

00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,256
in a refrigerated truck.

00:23:06,256 --> 00:23:07,658
That’s our crime scene.

00:23:09,294 --> 00:23:10,662
And it’s mobile.

00:23:15,768 --> 00:23:19,540
Hey, Nick,
I’ve been looking for you.

00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,810
This girl you’ve
been helping with
the 416...?

00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:23,845
She got in a fight
with a security guard.

00:23:23,845 --> 00:23:25,447
Is she a friend
of yours?

00:23:25,447 --> 00:23:27,417
Are you asking me
what I think you’re asking me?

00:23:27,417 --> 00:23:30,253
Are you doing anything that
could compromise the unit?

00:23:30,253 --> 00:23:31,488
I don’t believe this.

00:23:31,488 --> 00:23:32,823
You’ve always been
so cool.

00:23:32,823 --> 00:23:34,125
I have to ask.
It’s part of the job.

00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:35,527
Sanders ratted me out,
right?

00:23:35,527 --> 00:23:36,728
No, Brass.

00:23:36,728 --> 00:23:38,531
Do you want to
talk about this?

00:23:38,531 --> 00:23:40,199
I don’t think so.

00:23:42,569 --> 00:23:44,338
Excuse you.

00:23:44,338 --> 00:23:45,572
What’s his problem?

00:23:45,572 --> 00:23:46,941
Me, I guess.

00:23:46,941 --> 00:23:48,543
Did you find out
anything?

00:23:48,543 --> 00:23:50,812
Brass got us a listing of
all the refrigerated trucks

00:23:50,812 --> 00:23:53,082
that made deliveries
to the market yesterday.

00:23:53,082 --> 00:23:55,017
There’s a female
trucker on it.

00:24:03,895 --> 00:24:05,297
SIDLE:
Not bad.

00:24:06,666 --> 00:24:09,836
I’m impressed.

00:24:09,836 --> 00:24:12,907
Yeah, I passed up
a chance to play
semi-pro ball.

00:24:12,907 --> 00:24:16,511
Went to college
instead.

00:24:16,511 --> 00:24:17,980
I meant the Haeckel marks.

00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:20,917
They should tell us
what we need to know.

00:24:25,022 --> 00:24:28,058
This is the glass
you line-drived.

00:24:28,058 --> 00:24:30,028
That’s the glass
you "sawzalled."

00:24:32,398 --> 00:24:34,634
SIDLE:
Right angles face
the same direction.

00:24:34,634 --> 00:24:36,703
Take a look.

00:24:36,703 --> 00:24:38,806
Oh, now I’m worthy?

00:24:38,806 --> 00:24:41,009
Just take a damn look.

00:24:44,045 --> 00:24:45,981
That’s crazy.

00:24:45,981 --> 00:24:47,249
I loved my brother.

00:24:47,249 --> 00:24:50,020
Maybe you did,
maybe you didn’t,

00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,755
but we think
you murdered him.

00:24:51,755 --> 00:24:53,624
Based on what?

00:24:53,624 --> 00:24:55,527
The evidence.

00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:57,029
What evidence?

00:24:57,029 --> 00:25:00,166
You ever heard of Haeckel marks?

00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:01,534
No.

00:25:01,534 --> 00:25:02,802
When a window
is broken

00:25:02,802 --> 00:25:04,838
from the outside,

00:25:04,838 --> 00:25:06,273
which is what a burglar
would do,

00:25:06,273 --> 00:25:08,809
<i>Haeckel marks form right angles</i>

00:25:08,809 --> 00:25:10,378
<i>to the inside of the window.</i>

00:25:10,378 --> 00:25:13,149
But when a window is broken
from the inside,

00:25:13,149 --> 00:25:16,052
which is what a peckerwood
like you would do,

00:25:16,052 --> 00:25:17,888
<i>Haeckel marks form right angles</i>

00:25:17,888 --> 00:25:20,191
<i>to the outside of a window.</i>

00:25:24,897 --> 00:25:28,601
What did you use
to break the window, Kenny?

00:25:28,601 --> 00:25:30,436
I didn’t use anything.

00:25:31,705 --> 00:25:33,841
I didn’t do it.

00:25:37,245 --> 00:25:39,147
I want a lawyer.

00:25:47,024 --> 00:25:49,194
Well, we know
he did it.

00:25:49,194 --> 00:25:50,896
We can’t prove it,
but we’ve got a motive.

00:25:50,896 --> 00:25:52,531
He needed the money.

00:25:52,531 --> 00:25:54,934
Okay, let’s say
killing his brother
would get it for him.

00:25:54,934 --> 00:25:57,370
We’re back to how
do we prove it.

00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:59,740
He’s a day trader--
spends all day on his computer.

00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:00,975
If we want to know
more about him,

00:26:00,975 --> 00:26:02,243
that’s where we
should be looking.

00:26:02,243 --> 00:26:04,146
And his computer is...?
Still at the house.

00:26:04,146 --> 00:26:07,049
Still at the house?
Well, we got probable cause.

00:26:07,049 --> 00:26:09,085
Why don’t we go get a...?

00:26:09,085 --> 00:26:10,887

00:26:51,305 --> 00:26:52,639

And for the record,

00:26:54,008 --> 00:26:55,443
she wasn’t working,
she was shopping.

00:26:55,443 --> 00:26:57,212
And the security guard
was a jerk, man.

He pushed her around,

00:27:04,488 --> 00:27:06,323
No, I can’t.

00:27:06,323 --> 00:27:07,858
There’s something about her.

she doesn’t have

00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:14,867
I had Sanders

but the problem is,
I can’t get a match.

00:27:17,971 --> 00:27:19,206
The security guard

00:27:19,206 --> 00:27:21,075

Yeah, but you do know her.

00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,136
Yeah, professionally.

00:27:43,136 --> 00:27:45,439
My profession, not hers.

00:27:45,439 --> 00:27:48,042
I cut her some slack
a while back.

00:27:48,042 --> 00:27:50,278
She’s bad news,
but she’s a babe.

sufficient, thank you.

What’s that gonna
tell you--

00:30:10,086 --> 00:30:12,089
She’s not the one.

00:30:12,089 --> 00:30:13,290
So did I win
something?

00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:15,059
The right to
keep on trucking.

00:30:15,059 --> 00:30:17,129
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:30:17,129 --> 00:30:18,464
Here you go, bubba.

00:30:19,532 --> 00:30:21,400
Hey, we’re outta here!

00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,702
You know,
I’m starting to think

00:30:22,702 --> 00:30:25,372
that maybe we should
be looking for a man.

00:30:25,372 --> 00:30:28,609
Only 3% of multiple killers
are female.

00:30:28,609 --> 00:30:30,512
And a woman
wouldn’t need a trophy.

00:30:30,512 --> 00:30:32,915
BRASS:
And a body on ice
is definitely a trophy.

00:30:32,915 --> 00:30:35,752
Well, Ms. Hard-ass travels
with her boyfriend.

00:30:35,752 --> 00:30:38,021
I bet you a lot of guys
travel with their girlfriends.

00:30:38,021 --> 00:30:39,390
What if it was a man
with a woman

00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:41,625
who would do anything he asked?

00:30:55,377 --> 00:30:57,412
Then I said,
"Hey, us guys have
to stick together."

00:30:57,412 --> 00:31:01,284
He’s like, "Right.
You’re the man!"

00:31:01,284 --> 00:31:03,653
So, I mean, I could’ve
used an STR-DNA

00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:06,323
but it’s too state-of-the-art,
it’s overkill.

00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:09,928
So I used
an HLA-DQ-A1 with a...

00:31:09,928 --> 00:31:11,830
polymarker.

00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:15,302
That’s--that’s very,
very interesting.

00:31:15,302 --> 00:31:17,170
You don’t care about this
at all, do you?

00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:19,707
No.
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:31:19,707 --> 00:31:21,676
But to be honest with you,
all I really care about

00:31:21,676 --> 00:31:24,646
is whether the charges against
me are going to be dropped.

00:31:28,084 --> 00:31:29,753
Are they?

00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:34,859
The D.A. threw out the case.

00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:36,962
Great.

00:31:36,962 --> 00:31:38,163
So I can shoplift

00:31:38,163 --> 00:31:40,032
at that boutique again?

00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:42,769
I was kidding,
I was kidding.

00:31:42,769 --> 00:31:45,239
Besides, they never have any
good sales there, anyway.

00:31:45,239 --> 00:31:46,707
( <i>chuckling</i> )

00:31:50,512 --> 00:31:53,482
I’d invite you out
for coffee, but...

00:31:53,482 --> 00:31:54,884
it’s probably
a bad idea.

00:31:54,884 --> 00:31:56,586
Uh, yeah.

00:31:56,586 --> 00:31:57,721
Yeah.

00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:02,160
But I can call you
sometime, you know,

00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,728
just in case I ever
get into trouble

00:32:03,728 --> 00:32:05,497
or something.

00:32:05,497 --> 00:32:08,768
Maybe you should try
not getting into trouble.

00:32:08,768 --> 00:32:11,037
You do owe me one.

00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,976
I owe you two.

00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,897
You know
where to find me.

00:32:40,108 --> 00:32:43,345
Is that right?

00:32:43,345 --> 00:32:45,580
Your boy Kenny
just lawyered up.

00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,650
Well, we got a warrant,

00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:50,621
so that should give us
the room for a minute.

00:32:52,723 --> 00:32:54,459
There’s something
wrong with it.

00:32:54,459 --> 00:32:56,061
Computers turn on.

00:32:56,061 --> 00:32:57,930
When they don’t,
it’s for a reason.

00:32:57,930 --> 00:32:59,131
Did you plug it in?

00:32:59,131 --> 00:33:00,833
The power light’s on.

00:33:02,101 --> 00:33:03,703
Really?

00:33:07,174 --> 00:33:08,709
Let me check it out.

00:33:14,884 --> 00:33:17,888
Well, he’s a sneaky S.O.B.,
I give him that.

00:33:17,888 --> 00:33:21,125
SIDLE:
Oh, o one is gonna
believe this.

00:33:21,125 --> 00:33:22,326
( <i>snaps picture</i> )

00:33:22,326 --> 00:33:23,662
All right.

00:33:29,269 --> 00:33:30,871
Let me see
that flashlight.

00:33:31,972 --> 00:33:33,641
There’s scratches
all over it.

00:33:33,641 --> 00:33:35,477
Nothing really
special about them.

00:33:35,477 --> 00:33:38,914
And the hotshot
takes another strike.

00:33:38,914 --> 00:33:39,915
Check it out.

00:33:39,915 --> 00:33:41,584
Not enough to cause
even a small scratch

00:33:41,584 --> 00:33:43,287
on your finger,
but more than enough

00:33:43,287 --> 00:33:45,089
to use as a basis
for comparison.

00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:47,425
SIDLE:
We match this to
the broken window, we got him.

00:33:47,425 --> 00:33:51,630
One, two, three.

00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:53,499
Left one is from
the broken window

00:33:53,499 --> 00:33:54,867
the other one
is from the gun,

00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:57,938
both dropping
at an identical rate.

00:33:57,938 --> 00:33:59,807
Glass is from
the same source.

00:33:59,807 --> 00:34:02,243
So Kenny broke the
window from the inside

00:34:02,243 --> 00:34:03,945
using the butt
of the gun.

00:34:03,945 --> 00:34:06,749
My theory...

00:34:06,749 --> 00:34:09,720
The brother was the executor
of the parents’ estate.

00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,455
He controlled
the family money.

00:34:11,455 --> 00:34:13,490
Sounds like more
than a theory.

00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:15,126
I called the county clerk.

00:34:15,126 --> 00:34:18,631
With the brother out of the way,
Kenny is the sole beneficiary.

00:34:18,631 --> 00:34:20,566
KENNY:
Do you have
any idea

00:34:20,566 --> 00:34:21,868
how much money
I’ve lost?

00:34:21,868 --> 00:34:23,537
Kenny, come on,
what are you doing?

00:34:23,537 --> 00:34:25,706
I’m your brother, okay?

00:34:25,706 --> 00:34:28,176
I already said
I’d loan you the money, okay?

00:34:28,176 --> 00:34:29,745
Come on!
$20,000?

00:34:29,745 --> 00:34:32,181
That doesn’t even begin
to solve my problems!

00:35:00,216 --> 00:35:04,188
Slam that jail door.

00:35:04,188 --> 00:35:07,792
Makes you reconsider,
doesn’t it?

00:35:07,792 --> 00:35:10,261
I never said
you weren’t a good CSI.

00:35:18,606 --> 00:35:20,508
WOMAN:
We’re state-of-the-art here--

00:35:20,508 --> 00:35:22,076
number one in vehicle
satellite tracking.

00:35:22,076 --> 00:35:24,779
I can locate
one or all
of our trucks

00:35:24,779 --> 00:35:26,849
with just a click
of a mouse, 24-7.

00:35:26,849 --> 00:35:28,584
Do you ever worry
that technology

00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:30,887
is gonna make us obsolete?

00:35:30,887 --> 00:35:32,957
No.

00:35:32,957 --> 00:35:36,895
Can you, uh,
narrow your database?

00:35:36,895 --> 00:35:40,867
Say, eliminate all trucks
that are not refrigerated?

00:35:40,867 --> 00:35:42,702
Yeah, I think I can.

00:35:44,404 --> 00:35:47,041
Can you eliminate all trucks

00:35:47,041 --> 00:35:49,645
that were not
in Las Vegas yesterday?

00:35:53,315 --> 00:35:57,020
Eliminate all trucks
that only travel in state.

00:36:00,524 --> 00:36:02,360
Now eliminate the trucks

00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,862
that don’t deliver

00:36:03,862 --> 00:36:06,265
to supermarkets
along the I-15.

00:36:08,568 --> 00:36:09,770
GRISSOM:
This is very cool.

00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:11,272
Eliminate all trucks

00:36:11,272 --> 00:36:13,675
that did not deliver
to Marty’s Market yesterday.

00:36:17,479 --> 00:36:18,681
WILLOWS:
That’s our guy.

00:36:18,681 --> 00:36:19,982
He delivered to all five towns

00:36:19,982 --> 00:36:21,417
all five supermarkets.

00:36:21,417 --> 00:36:22,819
Where is he now?

Get your hands up!

00:36:35,268 --> 00:36:36,403
Police!

00:36:36,403 --> 00:36:38,338
Step away from the truck
and put your hands

00:36:38,338 --> 00:36:39,907
on the back
of your head!

00:36:39,907 --> 00:36:41,976
Keep your hands in sight!
Get out of the truck!

00:36:41,976 --> 00:36:43,612
Hands over
your head!

00:36:45,815 --> 00:36:47,683
Step away from the truck.

00:36:47,683 --> 00:36:49,185
Put your hands on
the back of your head.

00:36:49,185 --> 00:36:51,054
I’m just making
my regular delivery...

00:36:51,054 --> 00:36:53,725
Don’t make me ask you twice.

Move! Hands on
the back of your head!

Hands on the back
of your head!

Left hand on the wall,
right hand on the wall.

00:37:02,401 --> 00:37:04,003
Check him for weapons.

Spread your legs. Nice and easy.

00:37:07,408 --> 00:37:09,110
Hey, get away from my truck!

I already know what happened.

00:38:52,506 --> 00:38:53,841

You got to help me!
I locked my baby in the car!

or life in prison.

to tell him you’re here?

Oh, he’s probably working.

00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:32,073
He works really hard.

00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:33,574
If you see him,

00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:36,178
could you just tell him
that, uh, Jason says thanks?

00:41:36,178 --> 00:41:38,346
Okay. Will he know what for?

00:41:38,346 --> 00:41:39,348

Hey, thanks
for busting me loose.

No, you’ll pay me back, shorty.

00:41:49,294 --> 00:41:51,062
Just don’t be pulling
any more fire alarms.

than you want.

I showed you?

right there?

00:42:19,232 --> 00:42:23,002
So you went to the casino
to win bail money.

00:42:23,002 --> 00:42:24,404
He needed my help.

00:42:24,404 --> 00:42:25,567
I didn’t win
anything, Sara.

00:42:25,567 --> 00:42:26,767
You’re a CSI.

00:42:26,767 --> 00:42:27,748
You saw me enter
a casino.

00:42:27,748 --> 00:42:28,948
Did you see me
place a bet?

00:42:28,948 --> 00:42:30,648
You want to tell me you didn’t?

00:42:30,648 --> 00:42:32,882
I don’t have
to tell you anything.

00:42:34,648 --> 00:42:40,148
Look, I went there to collect
a debt that was owed to me.

00:42:40,148 --> 00:42:42,048
We’re supposed
to be working together.

00:42:42,048 --> 00:42:45,148
Next time,
just try talking to me

00:42:45,148 --> 00:42:47,682
instead of going around
behind my back.
