00:00:13,125 --> 00:00:17,262
( <i>women laughing</i> )
We are just warming up,
my girl.

00:00:17,329 --> 00:00:19,208
Wait, wait, wait.

00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:20,643
I don't think
this is the right way.

00:00:20,709 --> 00:00:21,810
It's a shortcut.

00:00:21,877 --> 00:00:23,545
A shortcut? To where?

00:00:23,612 --> 00:00:24,380
( <i>laughing</i> )

00:00:24,446 --> 00:00:25,848
( <i>thumping</i> )
Stop.

00:00:25,915 --> 00:00:27,182
Stop the car.

00:00:27,249 --> 00:00:29,118
It was just a pothole.

00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:31,053
I think you hit someone.

00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,154
( <i>tires screeching</i> )

00:00:45,734 --> 00:00:47,670
The blonde behind the wheel.

00:00:47,736 --> 00:00:49,838
Girlfriend in
the passenger seat
called it in.

00:00:49,905 --> 00:00:53,409
Vehicular manslaughter.

00:00:55,377 --> 00:00:56,979
Taillight?

00:00:57,046 --> 00:00:58,781
Yeah.

00:01:00,649 --> 00:01:03,752
Have you been drinking, Warrick?

00:01:03,819 --> 00:01:05,020
No, I'm having
a block party.

00:01:05,087 --> 00:01:06,221
I marked it

00:01:06,288 --> 00:01:08,023
where I found it--
over on the sidewalk

00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:09,758
over there.

00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:37,686
Two distinct tire treads--

00:01:37,753 --> 00:01:40,556
one wide...

00:01:40,623 --> 00:01:42,224
one narrow.
Given the extensive

00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:44,293
bruising from
the wide tread mark

00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,897
the victim was killed by
a larger vehicle, not a compact.

00:01:47,963 --> 00:01:50,065
Hey, O'Riley

00:01:50,132 --> 00:01:53,569
I wouldn't book
those suspects just yet.

00:01:53,636 --> 00:01:56,438

about ten minutes
ago-- a shooting

00:02:39,297 --> 00:02:41,232
at Vegas Grounds Coffee
Shop, Eighth and Main.

00:02:41,299 --> 00:02:42,834
Multiple fatalities.

00:02:42,901 --> 00:02:44,669
We want this one.
You guys get over there.

Keep the media
out of it.
Right.

00:02:47,339 --> 00:02:49,007
Hey, remember about
three months ago

00:02:49,074 --> 00:02:52,010
I applied to the American
Academy meeting in Chicago?

00:02:52,077 --> 00:02:54,012
Well, the deadline
for your approval

00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:55,180
is end of shift today.

00:02:55,246 --> 00:02:56,548
It's not a problem.

00:02:56,615 --> 00:02:58,049
There's important papers...

00:02:58,116 --> 00:02:59,684
You don't have to explain--
consider it done.

00:02:59,751 --> 00:03:01,019
Thank you.

00:03:01,086 --> 00:03:02,053
Good luck.

00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,255
Printed your hit-and-run.

00:03:04,322 --> 00:03:07,525
AFIS found a match--
Brian Clemonds, 22

00:03:07,592 --> 00:03:09,194
born in Vegas,
and he's deaf.

00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,229
You can tell he's deaf
by his fingerprints?

00:03:11,296 --> 00:03:12,530
Actually, yes--

00:03:12,597 --> 00:03:15,400
he was printed as part
of a state aid program in '81.

00:03:15,467 --> 00:03:19,037
To confirm,
I examined his ear canal.

00:03:19,104 --> 00:03:21,840
Normally, the malleus
is shaped like a hammer--

00:03:21,906 --> 00:03:24,876
a long, smooth handle connecting
to a blunt head--

00:03:24,943 --> 00:03:29,014
but Brian's malleus is knotted,
both of them-- birth defect.

00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,550
There's a college for
the deaf about a mile
from where we found him.

00:03:32,617 --> 00:03:34,419
WARRICK:
So, Brian takes a walk

00:03:34,486 --> 00:03:37,088
crosses the street, doesn't
hear the car, gets creamed.

00:03:37,155 --> 00:03:39,090
SARA:
The vehicle--
probably a truck

00:03:39,157 --> 00:03:42,260
or an SUV, based on the width
of the tire tread-- takes off.

00:03:42,327 --> 00:03:44,696
Later, along comes
a compact--

00:03:44,763 --> 00:03:47,365
thump-- runs over his dead body.

00:03:47,432 --> 00:03:49,134
ROBBINS:
Maybe, maybe not.

00:03:50,268 --> 00:03:52,404
See the dried blood
on his knuckles?

00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,939
No associated wounding.

00:03:54,005 --> 00:03:55,540
Blood's probably not his.

00:03:55,607 --> 00:03:57,242
WARRICK:
You know what that means--

00:03:57,309 --> 00:03:58,910
Smackdown--
the kid was in a fight.

00:03:58,977 --> 00:04:00,045
That ended in murder.

00:04:00,111 --> 00:04:02,047
Did you send a sample
of his blood to DNA?

00:04:02,113 --> 00:04:03,281
When you find the suspect

00:04:03,348 --> 00:04:05,116
you'll nail him
with his own body fluid.

00:04:05,183 --> 00:04:07,285
Has his family been notified?

00:04:07,352 --> 00:04:08,653
Not yet.

00:04:14,559 --> 00:04:17,562
One person dead, it's a shame;
more than one's a party.

00:04:17,629 --> 00:04:19,898
Get ready
to pull a double.

We got four dead,
one on the way to the hospital.

00:04:58,737 --> 00:05:00,805
The kid who belonged
to those headphones.

00:05:00,872 --> 00:05:02,674
I count two--
where are the others?

00:05:02,741 --> 00:05:03,808
One behind the counter;

00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:06,177
one in the back room.
Guy wasn't light
with the ammo.

00:05:06,244 --> 00:05:07,846
This place is raining
shell casings.

00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,549
Hey, I know this guy.

00:05:11,616 --> 00:05:13,818
I bet you do.
Who doesn't know
Frankie Flynn?

00:05:13,885 --> 00:05:15,086
Used to own the Orpheus.

00:05:15,153 --> 00:05:17,222
Lost his gaming license
a couple of years ago.

00:05:17,289 --> 00:05:20,392
Oh, yeah.
Too many dips in the chips.

00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:22,627
Yeah, you got that right.
Who's the muscle?

00:05:22,694 --> 00:05:23,828
This is, uh, Al Robson

00:05:23,895 --> 00:05:25,630
Frankie Flynn's bodyguard.

00:05:25,697 --> 00:05:27,666
Cash taken?
Till's full and
all the wallets

00:05:27,732 --> 00:05:28,800
are accounted for.

00:05:28,867 --> 00:05:30,402
I don't think anyone
was interested

00:05:30,468 --> 00:05:32,871
in the, uh, cash...
or the coffee.

00:05:32,937 --> 00:05:36,174
You're thinking hit?

00:05:36,241 --> 00:05:39,511
Maybe. Frankie drives
a bullet-proof car.

00:05:39,577 --> 00:05:41,313
What does that tell you?

( <i>doorbell rings</i>
<i>and bell ringing</i> )

00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:52,684

00:06:52,751 --> 00:06:53,985
Yes?

00:06:54,052 --> 00:06:55,253
My name is Gil Grissom.

00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,988
I'm with the Las
Vegas Crime Lab.

00:06:57,055 --> 00:06:59,758
Crime Lab?

00:06:59,824 --> 00:07:01,626
May I come in
for a minute?

00:07:01,693 --> 00:07:03,028
Okay.

00:07:12,537 --> 00:07:13,672
My son is deaf.

00:07:13,738 --> 00:07:16,441
That bell is connected
to the doorbell.

00:07:16,508 --> 00:07:17,976
The bell sets off vibrations

00:07:18,043 --> 00:07:19,844
which reverberate
on the floorboards

00:07:19,911 --> 00:07:21,913
so that he knows
someone's at the door.

00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:25,383
Yes.

00:07:26,418 --> 00:07:29,220
Mrs. Clemonds, I'm here
about your son Brian.

00:07:31,756 --> 00:07:34,993
There's no easy way
to say this.

00:07:36,328 --> 00:07:40,699
Oh, God, please, no.

00:07:41,733 --> 00:07:44,703
Brian was killed tonight.

00:07:44,769 --> 00:07:48,506
No, no... no...

00:07:55,413 --> 00:07:56,815
This is my fault.

00:07:56,881 --> 00:07:59,317
No. No, it's not.

00:07:59,384 --> 00:08:02,520
When I was pregnant,
I had the German measles

00:08:02,587 --> 00:08:05,223
and the virus
took away his hearing.

00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:06,558
It's my fault.

00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:09,160
No, Mrs. Clemonds...

00:08:09,227 --> 00:08:11,463
we think he might
have been murdered.

00:08:11,529 --> 00:08:13,198
Murdered?

00:08:15,934 --> 00:08:19,337
Would you like to talk to
a family services counselor?

00:08:19,404 --> 00:08:20,705

Just find out
who did this to my boy.

00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,915
Please.

00:08:30,982 --> 00:08:32,384
It's been

now a hit.

It's going to take a while
to process all the bodies.

What do you know
about Flynn?

00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,225
I always start

gunshot wounds to the head

00:08:43,962 --> 00:08:45,864
and the abdomen.
Any bullets recovered?

00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:48,833
Only one, out of the head--
uh, nine-millimeter .357.

00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,902
I deal with
the pin cushions.

00:08:50,969 --> 00:08:53,171
Ballistics deals
with the pins.

00:08:53,238 --> 00:08:54,739
Shooter could have
saved himself

00:08:54,806 --> 00:08:56,708
a lot of trouble
if he'd waited a month or two.

00:08:56,775 --> 00:08:58,043
Why?

00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:02,814

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,756
Wonder if she even knew
she was pregnant.

00:09:19,364 --> 00:09:22,233
How far along was she?

00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,270
About six weeks.
She knew.

00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:46,791
Another nine-millimeter,
just like our casings.

00:09:46,858 --> 00:09:50,128
Nine bullets,
all the same caliber.

( <i>sighs</i> )

00:10:27,432 --> 00:10:30,468
Wait... Did you call
their parents?

00:10:30,535 --> 00:10:32,470
Once the coroner makes
a positive I.D.

00:10:32,537 --> 00:10:34,272
their families will be notified.

00:10:34,339 --> 00:10:37,008
CATHERINE:
Shooting occurred

00:10:37,075 --> 00:10:38,677
around closing time.

00:10:38,743 --> 00:10:41,980
Is it customary
for your employees to close up?

00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:46,217
Erin locked up twice a week,
10:00 on the nose.

00:10:46,284 --> 00:10:49,554
She was training Alice, moving
on at the end of the month.

00:10:49,621 --> 00:10:52,891
I can't believe
they're gone.

00:10:54,626 --> 00:10:57,996
Dr. Gilbert, we need your help.

00:10:59,397 --> 00:11:00,899
Brian Clemonds was murdered.

00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,236
Was he having any difficulties?

00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:10,709
Anyone have a grudge
against him?

00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:14,045
We understand
you don't want

00:11:14,112 --> 00:11:17,048
a homicide investigation
upsetting your students.

00:11:17,115 --> 00:11:20,352
I'm severely deaf,
and I can communicate fine.

00:11:20,418 --> 00:11:22,020
I'd appreciate it
if you'd look at me

00:11:22,087 --> 00:11:23,254
when you speak to me.

00:11:23,321 --> 00:11:24,489
I wear a hearing aid

00:11:24,556 --> 00:11:25,924
and I can read lips.

00:11:25,991 --> 00:11:29,027
You could have asked
if I needed an interpreter.

00:11:29,094 --> 00:11:32,697
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to offend you.

00:11:32,764 --> 00:11:35,734
There are 152 students
at my school.

00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,335
We live together;

00:11:37,402 --> 00:11:39,270
we study together;
we eat together.

00:11:39,337 --> 00:11:41,539
We're a family.

00:11:41,606 --> 00:11:43,942
And Brian is dead.

00:11:45,844 --> 00:11:48,780
Dr. Gilbert, we're just
following protocol.

00:11:48,847 --> 00:11:50,582
We need to speak

00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:53,118
with Brian's friends,
his roommates.

00:11:53,184 --> 00:11:55,520
We'll also need access
to his records.

00:11:55,587 --> 00:11:57,856
The crime didn't happen here--
it happened out there.

00:11:57,922 --> 00:11:59,758
I'm not accusing anybody
of anything.

00:11:59,824 --> 00:12:02,927
Neither am I, but there
are more of you, right?

00:12:02,994 --> 00:12:06,398
Send someone else, someone
with more understanding

00:12:06,464 --> 00:12:08,566
of this school

00:12:08,633 --> 00:12:10,101
of my students.

00:12:10,168 --> 00:12:13,805
But we're here now,
and evidence is time sensitive.

00:12:13,872 --> 00:12:15,373
How can you solve a crime

00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,342
without understanding
the victim?

00:12:23,515 --> 00:12:25,016
Um, she's kicking us out.

00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:50,809
Hey.

00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:52,477
How'd it go
at the college?

00:12:52,544 --> 00:12:53,778
They're not cooperating.

00:12:53,845 --> 00:12:56,247
Yeah, we didn't have a warrant,
so she kicked us out.

00:12:56,314 --> 00:12:57,749
What did you do?
What did we do?

00:12:57,816 --> 00:13:00,185
We met with the president,
asked a few questions.

00:13:00,251 --> 00:13:01,553
She was kind of hostile.

00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,355
Like it's our fault
we can hear.

00:13:03,421 --> 00:13:05,457
All right. Let's go.

00:13:13,465 --> 00:13:14,966
Dr. Gilbert?

00:13:15,033 --> 00:13:16,868
I'm Gil Grissom
with the Crime Lab.

00:13:16,935 --> 00:13:18,703
You kicked my people
out of your office.

00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:20,205
Well, I'm kicking
you out, too.

00:13:24,376 --> 00:13:27,646
Look, your student is dead.

00:13:27,712 --> 00:13:32,784
Don't you want to know
who's responsible? I do.

00:13:32,851 --> 00:13:35,687
Your people can't
solve this crime.

00:13:35,754 --> 00:13:38,957
Why? 'Cause they don't
understand the victim?

00:13:39,024 --> 00:13:42,193
Help them understand.

00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,362
When a deaf person
meets a hearing person

00:13:44,429 --> 00:13:47,666
the hearing person so much as
says, "I'm normal, you're not."

00:13:47,732 --> 00:13:51,169
Is that what you think
I'm saying?

00:13:51,236 --> 00:13:54,539
A student is dead.

00:13:54,606 --> 00:13:57,709
Maybe you feel responsible.

00:13:57,776 --> 00:13:59,711
Maybe you're angry.

00:13:59,778 --> 00:14:02,714
But don't be angry at us.

00:14:02,781 --> 00:14:06,351
We want to help you.

00:14:06,418 --> 00:14:07,953
If I agree to cooperate

00:14:08,019 --> 00:14:10,689
you will include me
in your investigation?

00:14:10,755 --> 00:14:12,624
Yes, I will.

00:14:12,691 --> 00:14:14,659
I welcome your involvement.

00:14:14,726 --> 00:14:17,329
Now...

00:14:17,395 --> 00:14:20,899
may I see Brian Clemonds'
file? Please?

00:14:23,034 --> 00:14:25,837
I did nothing wrong.

00:14:25,904 --> 00:14:27,606
Brian filed six complaints

00:14:27,672 --> 00:14:29,841
against his roommate
Paul Arrington.

00:14:29,908 --> 00:14:33,044
Paul lost his hearing less
than a year ago-- a tumor.

00:14:33,111 --> 00:14:35,013
He hasn't adjusted.
He's angry.

00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,281
And he took it out
on Brian.

00:14:36,348 --> 00:14:38,950
Assaulted him.

00:14:39,017 --> 00:14:40,785
Brian requested a new roommate.

00:14:40,852 --> 00:14:42,554
Request denied?

00:14:42,621 --> 00:14:45,090
There were no other
available beds.

00:14:45,156 --> 00:14:47,726
I want to speak to Paul.

00:14:47,792 --> 00:14:49,861
He doesn't read
lips or sign.

00:14:49,928 --> 00:14:53,765
You don't need to hear or speak
to communicate.

00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:57,636
Or... commit murder.

00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:06,637
So, you going
to tell us

00:15:06,637 --> 00:15:08,105
how you
learned to sign?

00:15:08,803 --> 00:15:10,548
No.

00:15:11,448 --> 00:15:13,284
Well, the president
of the college

00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,718
is a real wack job.

00:15:14,785 --> 00:15:16,954
Sara, you see deafness
as a pathology.

00:15:17,021 --> 00:15:19,056
For Dr. Gilbert,
her deafness is
not her handicap

00:15:19,123 --> 00:15:20,970
it's her way of life.

00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:22,872
You know, I think you
might be siding with her.

00:15:22,939 --> 00:15:25,575
As long as you see this as
us versus them, you're going

00:15:25,641 --> 00:15:27,243
to have problems
on this case.

00:15:34,428 --> 00:15:37,498
This explains
what we're doing.

00:15:42,336 --> 00:15:43,470
What was that all about?

00:15:43,537 --> 00:15:45,105
Grissom signs.

00:15:45,172 --> 00:15:47,141
Do you know
what Grissom drinks

00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:48,342
when he goes out at night?

00:15:48,409 --> 00:15:49,510
He goes out?

00:15:49,577 --> 00:15:51,846
Exactly-- who knows
anything about that guy?

00:15:53,113 --> 00:15:53,814
Hey, check that out.

00:15:53,881 --> 00:15:56,617
Oh, I've read about
this machine.

00:15:56,684 --> 00:15:58,519
Very Frankenstein.

00:15:58,586 --> 00:15:59,587
Brain printing.

00:15:59,653 --> 00:16:01,689
They call it a visual polygraph.

00:16:01,755 --> 00:16:04,024
You've used one
of these before?

00:16:04,091 --> 00:16:05,326
Yeah, back in '97

00:16:05,392 --> 00:16:08,929
Grissom and I used one
to interview this rapist.

00:16:08,996 --> 00:16:10,164
The guy was mute

00:16:10,231 --> 00:16:12,933
but his brain waves
spoke loud and clear.

00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,470
So, you show the suspect
slides of the crime scene

00:16:16,537 --> 00:16:17,938
and if he's our guy...

00:16:18,005 --> 00:16:20,574
the oscillator
will give him away.

00:16:35,022 --> 00:16:37,591
Good, he recollects you.

00:16:45,099 --> 00:16:46,734
He recollects the college.

00:16:54,675 --> 00:16:56,177
He recollects Brian.

00:17:06,554 --> 00:17:08,989
No recollection.

00:17:27,675 --> 00:17:29,810
No recollection
of the crime scene

00:17:29,877 --> 00:17:32,079
or of Brian
under these conditions.

00:17:32,146 --> 00:17:33,214
May we go now?

00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:02,610
If you want
to find the killer

00:18:02,676 --> 00:18:04,411
look outside
the school.

00:18:34,108 --> 00:18:35,843
( <i>faintly</i> ):
Grissom!

00:18:41,749 --> 00:18:43,083
Sorry.

00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:44,418
I was thinking.

00:18:44,485 --> 00:18:46,320
About what it's
like to be deaf?

00:18:46,387 --> 00:18:47,888
About what it's like to hear.

00:18:49,823 --> 00:18:51,325
Sara told me that
you spoke in sign

00:18:51,392 --> 00:18:53,227
and now you're putting
plugs in your ears.

00:18:53,294 --> 00:18:55,229
I'm on a case.
Mm-hmm.

00:18:55,296 --> 00:18:57,998
Is that why you forgot
about the conference?

00:18:58,065 --> 00:19:00,000
The what?

00:19:00,067 --> 00:19:01,802
You missed the deadline.

00:19:01,869 --> 00:19:03,170
No Chicago for me.

00:19:03,237 --> 00:19:05,172
Oh, Catherine...

00:19:05,239 --> 00:19:06,874
This is the one meeting
I needed to attend.

00:19:06,941 --> 00:19:09,210
I don't always
want to be
second banana.

00:19:09,276 --> 00:19:10,311
I can probably do your job.

00:19:10,377 --> 00:19:11,545
I know that I can do Ecklie's.

00:19:11,612 --> 00:19:12,913
I forgot.

00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,915
I'm so sorry.

00:19:14,982 --> 00:19:17,551
Make sure to submit
the paperwork

00:19:17,618 --> 00:19:19,186
by the end of the day.

00:19:19,253 --> 00:19:21,255
I thought you said
that it was too late.

00:19:21,322 --> 00:19:22,556
Well, I knew you'd forget

00:19:22,623 --> 00:19:24,825
so I upped the deadline,
gave you a buffer.

00:19:26,093 --> 00:19:28,095
Don't forget again.

00:19:38,138 --> 00:19:40,341
Those the tire treads
from the crime scene?

00:19:40,407 --> 00:19:41,609
I photoed the
victim's torso

00:19:41,675 --> 00:19:44,879
and imaged the tread
mark-- scanned it

00:19:44,945 --> 00:19:47,147
got it running through
a Tread Assistance CD ROM.

00:19:47,214 --> 00:19:48,249
Any hits?

00:19:48,315 --> 00:19:49,383
Not yet.

00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:52,653
CD database-- 11,033 patterns.

00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,288
Could take a while.

00:19:54,355 --> 00:19:55,556
Yeah.

00:19:55,623 --> 00:19:57,424
What are you doing?

00:19:57,491 --> 00:19:58,959
Checking out
the dead guy's clothes.

00:20:08,502 --> 00:20:10,404
Whoa.

00:20:10,471 --> 00:20:11,739
What are these?

00:20:18,245 --> 00:20:20,214
What?

00:20:20,281 --> 00:20:21,615
They look like lice.

00:20:21,682 --> 00:20:22,983
Lice?

00:20:24,418 --> 00:20:26,687
Wasn't our dead guy clean?

00:20:26,754 --> 00:20:28,355
Yeah, he was.

00:20:28,422 --> 00:20:29,990
Lice adhere to

00:20:30,057 --> 00:20:32,459
hair follicles-- I didn't
find any stray hairs on him.

00:20:32,526 --> 00:20:34,361
Well, he was in a fight, right?

00:20:35,896 --> 00:20:37,264
Maybe his attacker had lice

00:20:37,331 --> 00:20:39,166
and they crawled off
on his sweater

00:20:39,233 --> 00:20:42,036
and they got comfy

00:20:42,102 --> 00:20:43,971
and the stray hair blew away.

00:20:45,906 --> 00:20:47,842
Hey.

00:20:47,908 --> 00:20:49,677
Any luck on the
tire treads?

00:20:49,743 --> 00:20:50,744
Computer's still processing

00:20:50,811 --> 00:20:52,613
but Warrick found something
pretty interesting.

00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,181
You know anything

00:20:54,248 --> 00:20:55,516
about lice?

00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:57,017
Yeah, they make
your head itch.

00:20:57,084 --> 00:20:58,319
And after head colds

00:20:58,385 --> 00:21:01,655
the most common medical
problem affecting children.

00:21:01,722 --> 00:21:03,357
Little problem
no one talks about, huh?

00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:05,826
Hey, Grissom,
can I see you

00:21:05,893 --> 00:21:08,095
for a sec? Stat.

00:21:09,363 --> 00:21:11,232
Stay on the tire treads.

00:21:12,533 --> 00:21:13,367
Warrick?

00:21:13,434 --> 00:21:14,835
Yeah, right behind you.

00:21:33,554 --> 00:21:36,657
A few more numbers and
this could have been cake.

00:21:36,724 --> 00:21:39,693
Guess who used to sign
Brad Kendall's paychecks

00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,694
six years ago?

00:21:40,761 --> 00:21:41,762
Frankie Flynn.

00:21:41,829 --> 00:21:42,930
Oh, yeah.

00:21:44,131 --> 00:21:45,933
Hey, Brad, thanks
for coming in.

00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,368
We've just got
a few more questions.

00:21:47,434 --> 00:21:49,503
Sure.

00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:50,704
You used to work for Flynn?

00:21:50,771 --> 00:21:52,306
At the Orpheus-- I was a waiter.

00:21:52,373 --> 00:21:53,507
He came in all the time.

00:21:53,574 --> 00:21:54,675
Sit down.

00:21:54,742 --> 00:21:55,442
Sit down.

00:21:58,245 --> 00:22:00,281
Did you see him
outside the coffee shop?

00:22:00,347 --> 00:22:02,516
Once in a while--
he owned the place.

00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:03,384
He was everywhere.

00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:04,685
Why don't you tell us

00:22:04,752 --> 00:22:06,453
about your CCW permit.

00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,955
I made cash deposits.

00:22:08,022 --> 00:22:09,924
I carry a concealed weapon.

00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:10,858
What kind?

00:22:10,925 --> 00:22:12,593
Glock, nine millimeter.

00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,261
We'll need to
see the weapon

00:22:14,328 --> 00:22:16,130
and any spare ammo.

00:22:16,197 --> 00:22:17,631
Yeah, of course,
I'll bring it in.

00:22:21,869 --> 00:22:23,370
I am the man.

00:22:23,437 --> 00:22:24,371
Why, what'd you do?

00:22:24,438 --> 00:22:26,207
Let me guess.

00:22:26,273 --> 00:22:27,408
You ran a DNA profile
on the blood

00:22:27,474 --> 00:22:28,776
off his knuckles
and you got a match.

00:22:28,843 --> 00:22:30,411
No.

00:22:30,477 --> 00:22:32,580
You ran a DNA profile
and got something
distinctive?

00:22:32,646 --> 00:22:34,281
Not quite.

00:22:34,348 --> 00:22:35,616
You got out of bed
and dressed yourself?

00:22:35,683 --> 00:22:37,718
No.

00:22:37,785 --> 00:22:38,686
What is it, Greg?

00:22:41,188 --> 00:22:42,923
Just put your nose
down the scope.

00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,763
Dots of blue light
on a red sea.

00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:50,998
Pyoverdin.

00:22:51,065 --> 00:22:53,000
Pyoverdin.

00:22:53,868 --> 00:22:54,902
A pigment excreted

00:22:54,969 --> 00:22:56,570
from <i>pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>

00:22:56,637 --> 00:22:57,972
which is a bacteria

00:22:58,038 --> 00:23:00,274
occasionally found
in the bloodstream.

00:23:00,341 --> 00:23:01,609
So what does
that give us?

00:23:01,675 --> 00:23:03,944
Your killer has
fluorescent blue
dots in his blood.

00:23:04,011 --> 00:23:05,045
So the guy's a glow-stick.

00:23:05,112 --> 00:23:06,580
How does that help us
track him down?

00:23:06,647 --> 00:23:07,982
Haven't I done enough
for one day?

00:23:08,048 --> 00:23:09,783
SARA:
We have a lead--
I found a partial

00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:11,652
serial number
on the broken taillight.

00:23:11,719 --> 00:23:12,753
I saw it.

00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,688
It's missing six digits,
it's useless.

00:23:14,755 --> 00:23:15,956
Maybe on its own

00:23:16,023 --> 00:23:18,359
but the tire tread database
kicked out a match.

00:23:18,425 --> 00:23:20,895
The tire belongs
to a Ford Explorer.

00:23:20,961 --> 00:23:22,530
A P235-75,
manufactured

00:23:22,596 --> 00:23:24,365
specifically for their SUVs.

00:23:24,431 --> 00:23:27,134
Only one with the same
partial serial number

00:23:27,201 --> 00:23:29,303
is registered in Vegas.

00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:32,973
What do you call a guy
with blue dotted blood

00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,342
lice and keys
to a Ford Explorer?

00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:37,211
A suspect?

00:23:37,278 --> 00:23:39,580
A killer.

00:23:49,733 --> 00:23:52,035
You found the car
that ran over Brian?

00:23:52,102 --> 00:23:53,837
Yes.

00:23:53,904 --> 00:23:57,240
The SUV's registered
to Adam Walkey.

00:23:57,307 --> 00:24:00,377
He's 18 years old;
no prior complaints.

00:24:00,443 --> 00:24:02,445
We're processing it now.

00:24:02,512 --> 00:24:03,947
I promised to keep
you informed.

00:24:04,014 --> 00:24:05,682
You kept your word.

00:24:11,721 --> 00:24:12,823
Lice?

00:24:12,889 --> 00:24:13,757
Creepy critters

00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:15,091
in the passenger seat.

00:24:16,126 --> 00:24:18,728
So... that's why Grissom's late.

00:24:18,795 --> 00:24:20,764
You just don't like other women
in his life.

00:24:20,831 --> 00:24:22,165
I'm going to pretend

00:24:22,232 --> 00:24:23,533
I didn't hear that.

00:24:24,634 --> 00:24:27,103
Affirmative on the head lice.

00:24:28,572 --> 00:24:29,706
Taillights match.

00:24:31,641 --> 00:24:33,043
We have a suspect.

00:24:33,109 --> 00:24:34,077
I'm advising Adam

00:24:34,144 --> 00:24:36,279
to invoke his
Fifth Amendment rights.

00:24:36,346 --> 00:24:38,548
O'RILEY:
No charges have been filed

00:24:38,615 --> 00:24:40,050
and I haven't asked a question.

00:24:40,116 --> 00:24:41,551
Go ahead and ask...

00:24:41,618 --> 00:24:42,752
he won't answer.

00:24:42,819 --> 00:24:44,754
Well, that's why I
suggested we meet here.

00:24:44,821 --> 00:24:46,923
I don't need him to talk.

00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:48,892
I just want his blood.

00:24:48,959 --> 00:24:51,495
Well, for that,
you're going to need a warrant.

00:24:58,335 --> 00:25:00,437
This warrant is for blood...

00:25:01,605 --> 00:25:03,773
and a scalp search.

00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,576
It's a Licemeister.

00:25:08,178 --> 00:25:09,279
We're going to comb

00:25:09,346 --> 00:25:10,914
your hair.

00:25:13,183 --> 00:25:15,352
Talk to me.

00:25:15,418 --> 00:25:17,254
Good news, bad news.

00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,623
Same caliber,
different gun.

00:25:20,891 --> 00:25:22,125
Bobby?

00:25:22,192 --> 00:25:23,960
Striations
don't match.

00:25:24,027 --> 00:25:25,862
The gun that killed those
five people at the coffee house

00:25:25,929 --> 00:25:27,430
isn't your store manager's.
The good news is--

00:25:27,497 --> 00:25:30,267
all of the nine
millimeter bullets
fired at the scene...

00:25:30,333 --> 00:25:32,102
from the same gun.

00:25:37,407 --> 00:25:38,642
You're looking
for only one guy.

00:25:38,708 --> 00:25:39,810
Well, what about

00:25:39,876 --> 00:25:41,278
the breach-face marks
on the casings?

00:25:41,344 --> 00:25:42,279
Indeterminate.

00:25:42,345 --> 00:25:43,713
Hmm.

00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:50,787
Well, well... looks
like you got zip.

00:25:50,854 --> 00:25:51,855
I got a ton of people out

00:25:51,922 --> 00:25:53,056
interviewing
every two-bit stiff

00:25:53,123 --> 00:25:54,391
that ever had a beef
against Flynn.

00:25:54,457 --> 00:25:55,692
They're all doing
the smart thing--

00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:56,693
keeping their mouth shut.

00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,961
WILLOWS:
So have no statements

00:25:58,028 --> 00:25:59,629
or physical evidence
indicating

00:25:59,696 --> 00:26:00,764
it was a hit on Flynn.

00:26:00,831 --> 00:26:03,333
What we have is
five dead bodies.

00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,668
Yeah... why?

00:26:04,734 --> 00:26:06,703
You know something
I don't know?

00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:08,371
Not yet.

00:26:10,407 --> 00:26:12,008
Nick?

00:26:12,075 --> 00:26:14,110
Smoke and mirrors.

00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:21,251
If it was a hit,
the guy came to the front door

00:26:21,318 --> 00:26:24,488
took out Al and Frankie,
and got the witnesses.

00:26:24,554 --> 00:26:26,223
Bullets will confirm it.

00:26:26,289 --> 00:26:30,327
Shooter was standing here
when he shot Al...

00:26:30,393 --> 00:26:34,531
Bam. Once in the chest.

00:26:34,598 --> 00:26:36,066
This is Flynn.

00:26:39,636 --> 00:26:41,505
One miss...

00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,476
one hit...

00:26:46,543 --> 00:26:49,679
one through and through.

00:26:50,714 --> 00:26:52,115
Headphones.

00:26:55,485 --> 00:26:57,521
Ricochet.

00:27:02,259 --> 00:27:03,226
Through and through.

00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:29,085
Each victim
gets a different color.

00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:30,921
Blue beams are isolated.

00:27:30,987 --> 00:27:33,957
The kid with the CD player
was alone.

00:27:38,361 --> 00:27:40,096
Flynn was closest to the door.

00:27:45,869 --> 00:27:49,806
Shooter was positioned between
Flynn and the front door.

00:27:49,873 --> 00:27:50,974
Flynn eats it...

00:27:51,041 --> 00:27:53,510
and I would have taken out
Big Al...

00:27:53,577 --> 00:27:54,711
bodyguard first.

00:27:54,778 --> 00:27:55,846
Me, too.

00:27:55,912 --> 00:27:57,414
Ident found

00:27:57,481 --> 00:28:00,317
both of the bodyguards' paws
on the counter.

00:28:16,633 --> 00:28:20,370
What if the shooter was here
when he shot Big Al?

00:28:20,437 --> 00:28:22,105
Big Al would already be dead.

00:28:22,172 --> 00:28:23,673
It doesn't make any sense.

00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:26,276
If the shooter
walked through
the front door.

00:28:26,343 --> 00:28:29,346
What if he came
through the back?

00:28:35,118 --> 00:28:38,822
Erin McCarty-- the employee
who was supposed to close up.

00:28:38,889 --> 00:28:40,657
Yeah, shot twice
in the back

00:28:40,724 --> 00:28:42,626
while heading for the rear exit.

00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:04,047
If she was headed towards
the parking lot

00:29:04,114 --> 00:29:07,350
how do you explain
this ricochet?

00:29:07,417 --> 00:29:08,652
What?

00:29:11,755 --> 00:29:13,056
STOKES:
Whoa...

00:29:15,325 --> 00:29:16,626
Like this.

00:30:14,951 --> 00:30:16,353
I love this job.

00:30:16,419 --> 00:30:20,323
The ricochet went
out into the store.

00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:23,527
There's no hole in the door.

00:30:25,295 --> 00:30:27,898
There's no hole in the door

00:30:27,964 --> 00:30:29,966
'cause the door
had to have been open.

00:30:32,102 --> 00:30:33,637
Assuming Erin
was running for her life

00:30:33,703 --> 00:30:35,338
the shooter follows her
in the back room

00:30:35,405 --> 00:30:36,273
shoots her twice--

00:30:36,339 --> 00:30:37,674
he would have
been shooting

00:30:37,741 --> 00:30:40,177
toward the parking lot.

00:30:40,243 --> 00:30:41,578
He shot toward
the parking lot first

00:30:41,645 --> 00:30:42,946
then toward
the front of the store.

00:30:43,013 --> 00:30:44,281
He'd only shoot
toward the front

00:30:44,347 --> 00:30:45,448
if there's somebody there.

00:30:45,515 --> 00:30:47,684
Someone was in the line of fire.

00:30:49,019 --> 00:30:49,953
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:52,422
What if we have it backwards?

00:30:52,489 --> 00:30:53,924
What if...

00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:57,427
the shooting began back here...
with Erin?

00:30:57,494 --> 00:30:59,362
Yeah, and somebody else saw.

00:31:00,897 --> 00:31:02,933
Frankie Flynn
was an innocent bystander.

00:31:02,999 --> 00:31:04,267
Wrong place, wrong time.

00:31:04,334 --> 00:31:07,270
The target was Erin...
the pregnant girl

00:31:07,337 --> 00:31:09,739
and the rest was damage control.

00:31:09,806 --> 00:31:11,842
Adam Walkey
doesn't have lice?

00:31:11,908 --> 00:31:12,943
Not even lice eggs.

00:31:13,009 --> 00:31:14,878
Maybe he got rid of them
since the other night.

00:31:14,945 --> 00:31:16,680
Delousing agents take
time to kick in.

00:31:16,746 --> 00:31:19,082
There would have
been evidence of
the infestation.

00:31:19,149 --> 00:31:20,584
Hey... got good news.

00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:22,352
Walkey's blood sample...

00:31:22,419 --> 00:31:24,087
<i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa?</i>

00:31:24,154 --> 00:31:25,388
Fluorescent blue.

00:31:26,656 --> 00:31:28,558
WARRICK:
Same as the blood

00:31:28,625 --> 00:31:29,759
we found on
Brian's knuckle.

00:31:29,826 --> 00:31:31,361
Greg, start a DNA comparison.

00:31:31,428 --> 00:31:33,363
This gives us
enough to hold Walkey.

00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:36,566
It's just like
Dr. Gilbert said...

00:31:36,633 --> 00:31:38,134
the killer
came from out here.

00:31:38,201 --> 00:31:41,138
Dr. Gilbert can afford
her personal bias.

00:31:41,204 --> 00:31:42,539
We can't.

00:31:42,606 --> 00:31:44,674
And we need a lot more
than Day-Glo bacteria

00:31:44,741 --> 00:31:46,243
to get a conviction.

00:31:51,163 --> 00:31:52,965
You really think
Erin knew she was pregnant?

00:31:53,031 --> 00:31:53,966
I mean, six weeks?

00:31:54,032 --> 00:31:55,701
20-year-old girl,
living at home?

00:31:55,767 --> 00:31:57,135
She would have
taken a test

00:31:57,202 --> 00:31:59,371
if she was five
seconds late--
panic city.

00:31:59,438 --> 00:32:01,039
Yeah, Brass talked
to her parents.

00:32:01,106 --> 00:32:02,474
There was no guy
in her life.

00:32:02,541 --> 00:32:04,610
Well, it's not
immaculate conception.

00:32:04,676 --> 00:32:06,011
If the guy was Mr. Right

00:32:06,078 --> 00:32:07,746
she would have
told her folks.

00:32:07,813 --> 00:32:09,414
Which means he
was Mr. Wrong.

00:32:09,481 --> 00:32:10,549
Maybe Mr. Married.

00:32:14,286 --> 00:32:15,721
Back for more?

00:32:15,787 --> 00:32:17,556
You still have
the pregnant girl?

00:32:17,623 --> 00:32:19,458
Mortuary will pick her up
later this afternoon.

00:32:19,524 --> 00:32:22,194
Stall them. We want
a paternity test.

00:32:22,261 --> 00:32:23,061
At six weeks?

00:32:23,128 --> 00:32:24,863
Six weeks with half of

00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:27,432
someone else's DNA
in her body.

00:32:48,186 --> 00:32:49,755
Check this out.

00:32:57,195 --> 00:32:59,464
This fabric matches
the victim's sweater.

00:32:59,531 --> 00:33:01,567
That's the muffler.

00:33:01,633 --> 00:33:03,468
Now, this is the
back of the car.

00:33:03,535 --> 00:33:05,237
And the taillight
was smashed.

00:33:05,304 --> 00:33:07,539
There's no way this car
was moving forward

00:33:07,606 --> 00:33:09,675
when it ran over
Brian Clemonds's body.

00:33:09,741 --> 00:33:12,210
Who drives backwards
on a downtown street?

00:33:13,745 --> 00:33:15,347
First degree murder.

00:33:15,414 --> 00:33:17,082
That's how we see it.

00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:19,451
It's okay.

00:33:19,518 --> 00:33:22,654
In that case,
my client is
now prepared

00:33:22,721 --> 00:33:24,623
to make a statement.

00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:26,592
Tell him, Adam.

00:33:26,658 --> 00:33:28,860
I may have hit the guy.

00:33:28,927 --> 00:33:30,662
That's some statement.

00:33:30,729 --> 00:33:32,497
ADAM:
Okay. I remember
hitting something.

00:33:32,564 --> 00:33:34,733
It was dark.

00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,201
I-I just kept driving.

00:33:36,268 --> 00:33:38,303
Didn't look back.

00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:39,705
Adam...

00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:44,576
We found lice in the driver's
seat of your vehicle

00:33:44,643 --> 00:33:46,378
but your scalp was clean.

00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,115
Was there anyone else there?

00:33:50,182 --> 00:33:52,217
A witness

00:33:52,284 --> 00:33:54,186
who might support your account?

00:33:55,921 --> 00:33:56,688
( <i>clears throat</i> )

00:33:56,755 --> 00:33:59,791
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:33:59,858 --> 00:34:02,394
Yeah, someone
was with me.

00:34:02,461 --> 00:34:04,396
Mark.

00:34:04,463 --> 00:34:05,664
Mark Rucker.

00:34:05,731 --> 00:34:08,300
He can confirm
everything I told you.

00:34:08,367 --> 00:34:09,468
I want to see him.

00:34:09,534 --> 00:34:11,370
That's the coward
who killed Brian.

00:34:11,436 --> 00:34:13,205
JANE:
What happened?

00:34:13,272 --> 00:34:14,206
He scared you?

00:34:14,273 --> 00:34:15,908
Talked a little funny?

00:34:15,974 --> 00:34:17,910
Made a lot of
noises? Screamed?

00:34:17,976 --> 00:34:20,579
Or maybe he just looked
at you the wrong way?

00:34:20,646 --> 00:34:22,381
Get away from me.

00:34:25,417 --> 00:34:27,753
You make me sick.

00:34:36,562 --> 00:34:38,864
You said you'd include me.

00:34:38,931 --> 00:34:40,999
You offered to help to help
with my investigation

00:34:41,066 --> 00:34:42,367
and now you're
compromising it.

00:34:42,434 --> 00:34:44,236
You found the killer.

00:34:44,303 --> 00:34:45,837
Who says it was a hit and run

00:34:45,904 --> 00:34:46,605
not murder.

00:34:46,672 --> 00:34:47,506
He has a witness.

00:34:47,573 --> 00:34:48,373
Who will lie for him.

00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,576
The witness can say
whatever he wants.

00:34:50,642 --> 00:34:53,679
The important thing is that
Adam Walkey was not alone

00:34:53,745 --> 00:34:55,581
when he killed Brian.

00:34:55,647 --> 00:34:58,250
Until now, I did not
know who was with him.

00:34:58,317 --> 00:35:00,686
And now you do.

00:35:00,752 --> 00:35:05,390
His witness is
our other suspect.

00:35:05,457 --> 00:35:07,025
911 page?

00:35:07,092 --> 00:35:08,760
What's up?

00:35:08,827 --> 00:35:10,896
Right gun.
Wrong barrel.

00:35:10,963 --> 00:35:12,731
Son of a bitch swapped
the gun barrel out.

00:35:12,798 --> 00:35:14,132
Check this out.

00:35:16,501 --> 00:35:18,403
Could be an
incomplete
tool mark.

00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:20,439
Maybe the guy
dropped his gun.

00:35:20,505 --> 00:35:23,008
Either way, we still
don't have the barrel.

00:35:23,075 --> 00:35:24,977
This is true.
But we've got
Kendall's ammo.

00:35:25,043 --> 00:35:26,245
What about
bullet batching?

00:35:26,311 --> 00:35:27,546
Match the bunter marks?

00:35:27,613 --> 00:35:30,015
Every casing's got two
pieces of information on it:

00:35:30,082 --> 00:35:31,250
manufacturer and caliber.

00:35:31,316 --> 00:35:33,418
Etched in by an
electrodischarge machine.

00:35:35,888 --> 00:35:38,423
Every casing from a given batch
of ammo has the same markings.

00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:41,260
So if you compared the casings
we collected at the crime scene

00:35:41,326 --> 00:35:43,262
with the casings from
Brad Kendall's gun...

00:35:43,328 --> 00:35:46,431
On a microscopic level,
we should find similar
characteristics...

00:35:46,498 --> 00:35:48,133
Which would link Brad's
ammo to the crime

00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,568
even though we
can't link his gun.

00:35:49,635 --> 00:35:50,969
Not as airtight
as matching the barrel.

00:35:51,036 --> 00:35:52,537
But still enough
to build a case.

00:35:52,604 --> 00:35:53,538
What about motive?

00:35:53,605 --> 00:35:56,441
Well, Catherine's
working on a hunch.

00:35:56,508 --> 00:35:57,442
Me? The father?

00:35:57,509 --> 00:35:58,810
No way. I'm married.

00:35:58,877 --> 00:35:59,978
I don't fool around.

00:36:00,045 --> 00:36:01,980
BRASS:
Would you like us to
explain the mechanics

00:36:02,047 --> 00:36:03,348
of sex in the workplace?

00:36:03,415 --> 00:36:04,917
CATHERINE:
You're the manager.

00:36:04,983 --> 00:36:05,918
Erin was the employee.

00:36:05,984 --> 00:36:07,319
BRASS:
You had the power.

00:36:07,386 --> 00:36:08,487
Happens all the time.

00:36:08,554 --> 00:36:09,955
You got it all wrong.

00:36:10,022 --> 00:36:12,190
Maybe we do; we all make
mistakes, but just to be sure

00:36:12,257 --> 00:36:13,625
why don't you give us
a DNA sample

00:36:13,692 --> 00:36:15,093
and you'll be
on your way.

00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,361
I don't believe this.

00:36:16,428 --> 00:36:17,429
Talk to anyone.

00:36:17,496 --> 00:36:19,264
I'm not like that.

00:36:19,331 --> 00:36:21,400
I've got a court order.

00:36:27,372 --> 00:36:29,141
It was a one-time thing.

00:36:29,207 --> 00:36:31,677
I didn't even know
she was pregnant.

00:36:33,412 --> 00:36:36,481
O'RILEY:
<i>I read him his rights.</i>

00:36:36,548 --> 00:36:38,650
Last chance
for a lawyer.

00:36:38,717 --> 00:36:39,985
I didn't do anything.

00:36:40,052 --> 00:36:41,653
Why would I need a lawyer?

00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:44,256
Fire away.

00:36:44,323 --> 00:36:46,758
I have just one question:

00:36:46,825 --> 00:36:48,293
Does your head itch?

00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,829
Do I have to answer that?

00:36:52,464 --> 00:36:55,701
I'm going to just, uh...

00:36:55,767 --> 00:36:58,537
rearrange your part
a little.

00:37:07,312 --> 00:37:08,914
Hmm.

00:37:09,915 --> 00:37:11,116
According to Adam Walkey

00:37:11,183 --> 00:37:12,651
you were with him in his SUV

00:37:12,718 --> 00:37:14,486
the other night

00:37:14,553 --> 00:37:18,023
and your head lice...
confirmed his statement.

00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:20,859
They also tell me
that you were driving.

00:37:20,926 --> 00:37:22,728
Yeah, yeah, I was with him.

00:37:22,794 --> 00:37:25,564
And like he told you,
we didn't know he hit the guy.

00:37:25,631 --> 00:37:27,199
How do you know
what Adam told us?

00:37:27,266 --> 00:37:29,201
( <i>rubber gloves snapping</i> )

00:37:33,739 --> 00:37:37,542
Now, why don't you just tell us
what really happened.

00:37:37,609 --> 00:37:40,746
Well, it was around midnight...

00:37:40,812 --> 00:37:43,715
<i>and we were listening</i>
<i>to the radio.</i>

00:37:43,782 --> 00:37:44,917
<i>I changed the station.</i>

00:37:44,983 --> 00:37:45,784
<i>Adam got pissed.</i>

00:37:45,851 --> 00:37:47,119
Dude, what are you doing?

00:37:47,185 --> 00:37:48,453
That song is a classic.

00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,188
It's not a classic.
It's crap.

00:37:50,255 --> 00:37:51,456
It's always
been crap.

00:37:51,523 --> 00:37:54,026
Now, this... this is tight.

00:37:54,092 --> 00:37:54,860
( <i>modern rock</i> )

00:37:54,927 --> 00:37:55,928
( <i>loud thud</i> )

00:37:55,994 --> 00:37:57,095
Wh-what was that?

00:37:57,162 --> 00:37:58,330
Probably a dog.

00:37:58,397 --> 00:38:00,065
Let's get out of here.

00:38:00,132 --> 00:38:01,633
We just kept driving.

00:38:03,535 --> 00:38:05,704
Yeah, it's the truth.

00:38:05,771 --> 00:38:08,340
The evidence says otherwise.

00:38:09,942 --> 00:38:12,210
What are you talking about?

00:38:12,277 --> 00:38:14,112
Well, there weren't just lice
in the SUV.

00:38:14,179 --> 00:38:16,381
There were lice

00:38:16,448 --> 00:38:17,983
on the victim's sweater.

00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:20,619
So, who cares about lice?

00:38:20,686 --> 00:38:23,355
Do you know what lice eat?

00:38:25,023 --> 00:38:26,291
Blood.

00:38:26,358 --> 00:38:28,727
I'm pretty sure

00:38:28,794 --> 00:38:31,630
I can prove that the lice
on Brian Clemonds

00:38:31,697 --> 00:38:33,665
came from your head.

00:38:37,069 --> 00:38:39,004
We got out of the car.

00:38:47,379 --> 00:38:49,648
We got to call the paramedics.

00:38:49,715 --> 00:38:52,417
We tell anybody,
we are in trouble.

00:38:52,484 --> 00:38:54,052
We can go to jail.

00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,856
But I didn't want
to leave him like that.

00:38:57,923 --> 00:38:59,458
Adam talked me into it.

00:38:59,524 --> 00:39:02,127
He had a scholarship
to Duke next year, you know.

00:39:02,194 --> 00:39:03,462
He couldn't risk it.

00:39:03,528 --> 00:39:05,063
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:07,766
Let me tell you
what I think happened.

00:39:07,833 --> 00:39:11,270
<i>You and Adam saw Brian</i>
<i>walking out of a liquor store</i>

00:39:11,336 --> 00:39:13,238
<i>carrying a six-pack.</i>

00:39:13,305 --> 00:39:14,306
<i>You're underage.</i>

00:39:14,373 --> 00:39:16,875
<i>Maybe you wanted him</i>
<i>to front you some beer.</i>

00:39:16,942 --> 00:39:18,877
Hey, man, can you
do us a favor?

00:39:18,944 --> 00:39:20,712
GRISSOM:
<i>Brian doesn't respond.</i>

00:39:22,414 --> 00:39:23,548
What's his problem?

00:39:23,615 --> 00:39:24,549
Let's find out.

00:39:24,616 --> 00:39:27,019
( <i>brakes screeching</i> )

00:39:27,085 --> 00:39:28,987
<i>Then you got out of the car.</i>

00:39:29,054 --> 00:39:31,390
Hey, moron, we just want
you to buy us some beer.

00:39:31,456 --> 00:39:32,925
How about we just
grab yours, huh?

00:39:32,991 --> 00:39:34,293
What do you want?
What do you say?

00:39:34,359 --> 00:39:35,294
You going to give it up?

00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,195
<i>Brian still doesn't</i>
<i>say anything.</i>

00:39:37,262 --> 00:39:38,230
<i>So you keep pushing.</i>

00:39:38,297 --> 00:39:39,264
Go away!

00:39:43,435 --> 00:39:44,870
Give...

00:39:46,638 --> 00:39:47,673
Bring him down!

00:39:52,411 --> 00:39:56,348
GRISSOM:
<i>The blood on the victim's</i>
<i>knuckles led us to Adam.</i>

00:39:56,415 --> 00:40:00,485
<i>The average male</i>
<i>loses 80 hairs a day.</i>

00:40:00,552 --> 00:40:05,023
<i>Stray hair left behind lice,</i>
<i>which brings us to you.</i>

00:40:10,395 --> 00:40:14,866
It would have ended there, but
as you were about to drive away

00:40:14,933 --> 00:40:16,902
<i>something caught</i>
<i>your attention.</i>

00:40:16,969 --> 00:40:19,071
<i>Something</i>

Please don't hit me!

00:40:24,943 --> 00:40:26,678
Please don't!

00:40:26,745 --> 00:40:27,779
( <i>yelling</i> )

( <i>engine revving</i> )

00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,622
<i>You backed the car up.</i>

00:40:40,158 --> 00:40:42,394
And you took off.

00:40:42,461 --> 00:40:44,863
I want a lawyer.

00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:47,199
Let me tell you something, son.

00:40:47,266 --> 00:40:48,901
Gil, the interrogation is over.

00:40:48,967 --> 00:40:50,235
He's requested counsel.

00:40:52,137 --> 00:40:54,072
Fine.

00:40:54,139 --> 00:40:56,074
No more questions.

00:40:56,141 --> 00:40:57,409
Just this.

00:40:57,476 --> 00:40:59,144
You want
to know why

00:40:59,211 --> 00:41:01,146
Brian Clemonds ran away
from you?

00:41:03,348 --> 00:41:05,651
It was dark;
you were shouting at him;

00:41:05,717 --> 00:41:09,922
and he didn't understand
what you were saying.

00:41:09,988 --> 00:41:12,925
Brian Clemonds was deaf.

00:41:15,694 --> 00:41:18,664
He was afraid of you.

00:41:21,066 --> 00:41:24,636
But you were more afraid
of him... weren't you?

00:41:43,822 --> 00:41:45,524
What am I looking at?

00:41:45,591 --> 00:41:47,526
STOKES:
Microscopic surface analysis.

00:41:49,161 --> 00:41:51,830
This ought to make
things more clear.

00:41:55,067 --> 00:41:57,502
A bunter tool
leaves a unique mark.

00:42:01,106 --> 00:42:03,475
Casings from your gun
are on the right.

00:42:03,542 --> 00:42:07,512
Casings collected
from the crime scene
are on the left.

00:42:07,579 --> 00:42:09,348
They're identical.

00:42:09,414 --> 00:42:11,717
You came here
that night...

00:42:11,783 --> 00:42:13,719
to kill Erin.

00:42:13,785 --> 00:42:15,120
<i>You came in through the back.</i>

00:42:15,187 --> 00:42:16,288
<i>Erin was in the office.</i>

00:42:16,355 --> 00:42:18,223
We got to talk.
I'm tired of
talking to you.

00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:20,192
Listen to me!
I'm tired of
listening to you.

00:42:20,259 --> 00:42:21,393
BRAD:
I will take
care of this.

00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:22,728
All you take care
of is yourself.

00:42:22,794 --> 00:42:24,162
Erin, think.
Use your head
for once.

00:42:24,229 --> 00:42:26,031
I'm not going to let
you ruin my life!

00:42:26,098 --> 00:42:27,499
I already have
thought about it.

00:42:27,566 --> 00:42:28,834
I'm going to
have this baby

00:42:28,901 --> 00:42:30,469
and you are going
to support it.

00:42:30,535 --> 00:42:33,205
I'll let you know if
it's a boy or a girl.

00:42:33,272 --> 00:42:33,572
( <i>gasps</i> )

00:42:36,074 --> 00:42:37,442
CATHERINE:
<i>But Alice saw.</i>

00:42:37,509 --> 00:42:38,577
<i>You shot her.</i>

00:42:38,644 --> 00:42:39,578
( <i>screams</i> )

00:42:39,645 --> 00:42:42,681
<i>You thought that</i>
<i>Alice had locked up</i>

00:42:42,748 --> 00:42:44,850
<i>but there was a kid</i>
<i>drinking coffee</i>

00:42:44,917 --> 00:42:46,852
and then things got out of hand.

00:42:56,962 --> 00:42:59,298
<i>And you just kept on shooting.</i>

00:43:03,435 --> 00:43:07,673
BRASS:
Brad Kendall,
you're under arrest

00:43:07,739 --> 00:43:09,608
for the murders of Frankie Flynn

00:43:09,675 --> 00:43:15,180
Al Robson, Roy Hinton,
Alice Neely and Erin McCarty.

00:43:15,247 --> 00:43:16,782
STOKES:
Six weeks pregnant

00:43:16,848 --> 00:43:18,417
with your child.

00:43:22,988 --> 00:43:25,591
I didn't mean for it
to happen like that.

00:43:25,657 --> 00:43:27,259
I just wanted
to talk.

00:43:27,326 --> 00:43:29,661
Is that why you
brought your gun?

00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:37,569
Some people
are just afraid.

00:43:37,636 --> 00:43:40,439
And that's why
they killed Brian.

00:43:40,505 --> 00:43:42,174
Because he was different.

00:43:43,308 --> 00:43:45,310
You don't see us
as different.

00:43:46,311 --> 00:43:47,579
You're not.

00:43:47,646 --> 00:43:49,681
Who taught you to sign?

00:43:51,016 --> 00:43:52,951
My mother.

00:43:53,018 --> 00:43:54,419
Tell me about her.

00:43:54,486 --> 00:43:55,621
And use your hands.

00:43:55,687 --> 00:43:57,289
You're a little rusty.
