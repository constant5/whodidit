00:00:10,583 --> 00:00:13,185
( <i>hammering</i> )

00:00:41,543 --> 00:00:43,345
Boss!

00:00:43,412 --> 00:00:46,048
We-We got a problem.

00:00:46,115 --> 00:00:50,185
( <i>indistinct radio chatter</i> )

00:01:10,839 --> 00:01:12,107
( <i>exhales deeply</i> )

00:01:15,177 --> 00:01:16,512
Well, clean surfaces

00:01:16,579 --> 00:01:18,547
make for good
analysis.

00:01:18,614 --> 00:01:20,082
Yeah.

00:01:20,149 --> 00:01:22,217
Well, that may be
the only good thing.

00:01:22,284 --> 00:01:25,821
I checked for
a wallet, no ID.

00:01:25,888 --> 00:01:27,623
Nothing on him.

00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:30,526
The kid looks like
a minor.

00:01:30,593 --> 00:01:32,528
Coroner's investigator
says he's been dead

00:01:32,595 --> 00:01:33,596
for over 12 hours.

00:01:33,662 --> 00:01:35,698
Happened sometime
this weekend.

00:01:43,272 --> 00:01:45,140
You going to pry

00:01:45,207 --> 00:01:46,775
that piece of cloth
from his hand?

00:01:46,842 --> 00:01:48,344
Not just yet.

00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:49,378
Help me
out here.

00:01:49,445 --> 00:01:51,680
Got any ideas on this one?

00:01:53,882 --> 00:01:55,651
Well, based on

00:01:55,718 --> 00:01:58,654
his pants around the knees,
I would say

00:01:58,721 --> 00:02:01,423
a crime of passion.

00:02:03,559 --> 00:02:05,027
Given the brutality
of it...

00:02:08,364 --> 00:02:11,333
seems to me an act of rage.

You know, I lose

cleaning up their
beer bottles

00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:47,434
and their
cigarette butts.

00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:49,601
Kids use it as a hangout, huh?

00:02:49,668 --> 00:02:50,602
Oh, sure. They think

00:02:50,669 --> 00:02:51,870
the house doesn't
have a lock,

00:02:51,937 --> 00:02:52,871
it belongs to them.

00:02:52,938 --> 00:02:54,506
Well, it's a crime scene,

00:02:54,573 --> 00:02:56,107
so it belongs to us now.

00:02:56,174 --> 00:02:57,776
Yeah. How long?

00:02:57,843 --> 00:02:59,711
As long as it takes.

00:02:59,778 --> 00:03:01,413
You know, I got two
teenagers at home,

00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,815
and they know how to respect
other people's property.

00:03:03,882 --> 00:03:05,116
Now, who's going
to feed them

00:03:05,183 --> 00:03:06,785
when I don't get
paid for today, huh?

00:03:06,852 --> 00:03:07,819
Huh?

00:03:07,886 --> 00:03:08,920
I can't tell you that.

00:03:16,795 --> 00:03:19,698
Take a look at his head,
tell me what you see.

00:03:25,937 --> 00:03:29,074
Definitely blunt force.

00:03:29,141 --> 00:03:30,642
That's a hammerhead.

00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:34,045
I thought you might say that.

00:03:35,747 --> 00:03:37,749
Well, we know
that people often

00:03:37,816 --> 00:03:41,553
commit crimes in places
they're familiar with.

00:03:52,364 --> 00:03:55,066
You got to be kidding me.

00:04:02,107 --> 00:04:03,275
BROWN:
I'll swab
the blood

00:04:03,341 --> 00:04:04,709
and see if it's all his.

00:04:16,521 --> 00:04:17,789
Grissom?

00:04:22,427 --> 00:04:25,430
Well, that should help.

00:04:27,766 --> 00:04:30,569
I'll trade you a hammer
for a screw.

00:04:30,635 --> 00:04:32,137
Name, please.

00:04:32,204 --> 00:04:33,972
I'll tell you mine,
you tell me yours.

00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:36,441
Oh, come on, baby.

00:04:36,508 --> 00:04:38,176
I'm stuck with these ugly fools
all day.

00:04:38,243 --> 00:04:40,378
A pretty girl comes by.
Just having a little fun.

00:04:40,445 --> 00:04:43,114
Yeah, murder always makes me
feel a little randy, too.

00:04:43,181 --> 00:04:44,483
Ooh.

00:04:50,622 --> 00:04:52,924
( <i>garbled radio transmission</i> )

00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,595
Fellows.

00:04:56,661 --> 00:04:58,396
Hey, uh,

00:04:58,463 --> 00:05:00,732
Mrs. Marlene Mitchell, 32.

00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:03,268
Apparent gunshot wound
to the chest.

00:05:03,335 --> 00:05:05,237
Entry, no exit.

00:05:05,303 --> 00:05:07,105
No other apparent
injuries.

00:05:08,373 --> 00:05:09,975
Do we know who shot her?

00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:11,276
I patted down all her friends.

00:05:11,343 --> 00:05:12,277
Nobody's carrying.

00:05:12,344 --> 00:05:13,278
Got a couple officers

00:05:13,345 --> 00:05:14,913
scanning the neighborhood
in case the,

00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:15,914
uh, weapon
got tossed.

00:05:15,981 --> 00:05:16,982
She was breaking
up a fight

00:05:17,048 --> 00:05:18,683
when she went down.

00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,352
Nobody saw anything?
Nobody heard anything?

00:05:20,418 --> 00:05:21,219
No.

00:05:21,286 --> 00:05:22,854
Somebody's lying.

00:05:24,422 --> 00:05:25,790
That the husband?

00:05:25,857 --> 00:05:26,958
The current one.

00:05:27,025 --> 00:05:29,294
The other one--
he's the ex.

00:05:31,163 --> 00:05:32,731
Interesting family reunion.

00:05:32,798 --> 00:05:34,566
Whose brilliant idea was that?

00:05:34,633 --> 00:05:36,268
The Mitchells
were moving in.

00:05:36,334 --> 00:05:37,936
The ex stopped
by to say hi.

00:05:38,003 --> 00:05:40,238
Don't you hate it
when hello leads to gunfire?

00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:43,375
I'll need to GSR both.

00:05:44,943 --> 00:05:46,511
Sir?

00:05:46,578 --> 00:05:49,881
I'm going to need to
test your hands for GSR.

00:05:49,948 --> 00:05:50,982
What's that?

00:05:51,049 --> 00:05:53,018
Gunshot residue.

00:05:53,084 --> 00:05:54,152
Why?

00:05:54,219 --> 00:05:55,854
To rule you out.

00:05:55,921 --> 00:05:58,423
You think I shot my wife

00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,592
the day after our honeymoon.

00:06:02,394 --> 00:06:04,362
We were just moving our stuff.

00:06:04,429 --> 00:06:06,465
Her ex, Todd, shows up.

00:06:06,531 --> 00:06:08,500
He knows
he's not supposed to come

00:06:08,567 --> 00:06:10,101
within 100 yards of her.

00:06:11,536 --> 00:06:13,071
But he did.

00:06:14,739 --> 00:06:16,174
Please?

00:06:16,241 --> 00:06:17,209
Marlene?

00:06:17,275 --> 00:06:18,577
Call 911.

00:06:20,946 --> 00:06:23,048
I thought it was a heart attack.

00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:27,986
Then I saw the blood.

00:06:28,053 --> 00:06:29,654
Yes, but there was
a restraining order against you.

00:06:29,721 --> 00:06:30,755
Why were you here?

00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,358
Thank you.

00:06:40,999 --> 00:06:42,901
WOMAN:
Distinguish!

00:06:42,968 --> 00:06:44,169
You ready to run?

00:06:44,236 --> 00:06:46,071
She does all my running.

00:06:46,138 --> 00:06:48,073
Thanks.
Trail!

00:07:12,297 --> 00:07:14,299
It's a hell of a place
to get lost.

00:07:14,366 --> 00:07:15,534
Yeah. We have
five million

00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,935
olfactory sensory
receptors.

00:07:17,002 --> 00:07:18,637
Penny's got
220 million.

00:07:18,703 --> 00:07:20,672
She sees the
world differently.

00:07:41,793 --> 00:07:44,396
The suspect
stopped here.

00:07:56,074 --> 00:07:57,309
Trail is still strong here.

00:08:03,982 --> 00:08:05,550
( <i>barking</i> )

00:08:05,617 --> 00:08:07,118
She's got a hit
on the Dumpster.

00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:12,891
( <i>barking</i> )

00:08:17,596 --> 00:08:18,864
She's getting nothing,

00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:21,633
but Penny will pick up
on anything they touched.

00:08:23,835 --> 00:08:26,371
( <i>barking</i> )

00:08:28,874 --> 00:08:30,942
There's something
in the silver bag.

00:08:36,615 --> 00:08:38,483
What do you think?

00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:40,652
Bought new clothes,
ditched the old ones?

00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,487
What's missing
from that sweater's

00:08:42,554 --> 00:08:44,389
what that dead kid had
in his hand.

00:08:44,456 --> 00:08:47,859
So, we're looking for a girl
who bought a new outfit...

00:08:49,528 --> 00:08:52,264
some earrings and a latte.

00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:55,333
Oh, an iced cappuccino,
actually.

00:08:56,568 --> 00:08:58,937
Congealed blood
in the pericardium.

00:08:59,004 --> 00:09:00,939
Heart's what took the bullet.

00:09:01,006 --> 00:09:02,474
Explains why she
just dropped.

00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:04,176
Yeah, she was dead in seconds.

00:09:05,577 --> 00:09:07,279
Hmm.

00:09:07,345 --> 00:09:08,613
Bullet's still in the heart.

00:09:18,657 --> 00:09:20,659
Here we go.

00:09:23,562 --> 00:09:25,697
There.

00:09:28,266 --> 00:09:32,370
Well, it looks
like a nine millimeter.

00:09:32,437 --> 00:09:33,939
I'll let Vega know.

00:09:34,005 --> 00:09:35,106
Fairly intact.

00:09:35,173 --> 00:09:36,641
Want to do the honors?

00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:38,810
Sure.

00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,189
That's it.

00:09:56,361 --> 00:09:58,196
Four inches?

00:09:58,263 --> 00:10:00,599
That's shallow.

00:10:00,665 --> 00:10:03,468
Standard handgun bullet
penetration's 12.

00:10:03,535 --> 00:10:04,936
Right.

00:10:05,003 --> 00:10:06,104
Give me a hand, will you?

00:10:06,171 --> 00:10:08,607
Sure.

00:10:11,309 --> 00:10:13,512
85 degree downward angle?

00:10:13,578 --> 00:10:15,647
Well, that's, uh,
fairly standard.

00:10:15,714 --> 00:10:16,882
Most gunshot wounds

00:10:16,948 --> 00:10:18,884
are 90 degrees,
give or take.

00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:20,785
Oh. Thanks, Doc.

00:10:20,852 --> 00:10:22,020
Right.

00:11:24,516 --> 00:11:26,184
JOHNSON:
They say in America,
you're on camera

00:11:26,251 --> 00:11:27,452
an average of
seven times a day.

00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:28,453
Go to a mall,

00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,855
and you can
at least triple that.

00:11:29,921 --> 00:11:31,022
I guess that's
good for us.

00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:32,057
I'm going to
think twice

00:11:32,123 --> 00:11:33,391
the next time
I try on a shirt.

00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:35,260
Well, legally,
they can't put cameras

00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:37,128
in dressing rooms,
but there's legal,

00:11:37,195 --> 00:11:38,797
and then there's what people do.

00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:41,366
Our girl bought her clothes
at 8:31.

00:11:41,433 --> 00:11:43,935
Let's scan the dressing room
footage

00:11:44,002 --> 00:11:46,004
from 8:00 on.

00:11:50,308 --> 00:11:52,177
Hold it.

00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:54,446
That's our sweater.

00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:56,181
And that's our girl.

00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:57,682
She did a walk out.
A "walk out?"

00:11:57,749 --> 00:11:59,651
Yeah, my girlfriend does it
all the time.

00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:01,153
She finds something she likes,

00:12:01,219 --> 00:12:03,355
rips the tags off
in the dressing room,

00:12:03,421 --> 00:12:04,656
hands them
to the clerk,

00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:06,591
and walks out
wearing the
new stuff.

00:12:06,658 --> 00:12:08,326
You go shopping
with your girlfriend?

00:12:08,393 --> 00:12:10,428
That's nice.

00:12:10,495 --> 00:12:12,197
Well, you can get her
prints from the receipts.

00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:13,198
DNA from the sweater.

00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:14,232
And you've got a face.

00:12:14,299 --> 00:12:15,233
You're close.

00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,635
Well, look at her.
She's a minor.

00:12:16,701 --> 00:12:17,803
She paid in cash.

00:12:17,869 --> 00:12:19,471
She's not going to be
in any database.

00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:21,006
Without a name,
we don't have much.

00:12:21,072 --> 00:12:23,008
Okay, one of our hammers
had blood on it.

00:12:23,074 --> 00:12:24,509
It matches the victim's.

00:12:24,576 --> 00:12:26,912
Did Greg analyze the clothes
from the Dumpster yet?

00:12:26,978 --> 00:12:28,213
Yeah. Blood's a match, too.

00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,383
Okay. So, the question is,
what is the connection

00:12:31,449 --> 00:12:32,818
between this girl

00:12:32,884 --> 00:12:34,853
and a construction worker?

00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,923
BRASS:
Mr. Curtwell, where were you
this weekend?

00:12:37,989 --> 00:12:39,958
I was fishing in Tahoe.

00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:41,893
Catch anything?

00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,295
No. Nothing
was biting.

00:12:43,361 --> 00:12:44,529
Anyone go with you?

00:12:44,596 --> 00:12:46,264
No.

00:12:46,331 --> 00:12:48,300
How long were you gone?

00:12:48,366 --> 00:12:50,302
Friday to Sunday.

00:12:50,368 --> 00:12:52,737
Look, I thought I was just here
to pick up my hammer.

00:12:52,804 --> 00:12:55,140
Do you ever leave your tools
at the job site?

00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:58,443
No way. That hammer--
it's perfectly balanced.

00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:01,146
BRASS:
Then how do you explain
the blood on it?

00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:03,348
And your injuries.

00:13:05,116 --> 00:13:07,552
Well, it's a construction site.

00:13:07,619 --> 00:13:09,621
People get hurt.

00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:11,389
BROWN:
The blood
that we found

00:13:11,456 --> 00:13:13,492
on your hammer...

00:13:13,558 --> 00:13:16,528
matches this kid right here.

00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:23,101
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,239
Is that the dead kid
from the house?

00:13:27,305 --> 00:13:28,406
Yeah.

00:13:28,473 --> 00:13:29,574
I never got a

00:13:29,641 --> 00:13:30,909
look at him.

00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:33,211
I-I I didn't go inside.

00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,782
What about her?

00:13:41,419 --> 00:13:44,122
That's my kid sister, Ashley.

00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,059
Why? What's she got
to do with it?

00:13:49,594 --> 00:13:51,363
You tell us.

00:13:57,706 --> 00:14:01,209
My parents died in a car
accident four years ago.

00:14:01,276 --> 00:14:02,778
SIDLE:
I'm very sorry.

00:14:02,844 --> 00:14:06,648
Your brother Gregory
is your guardian, right?

00:14:06,715 --> 00:14:08,784
Yeah.

00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:10,619
And he left you alone
all weekend?

00:14:10,686 --> 00:14:13,155
He goes away a lot.

00:14:13,221 --> 00:14:14,456
Okay.

00:14:14,523 --> 00:14:18,727
Why don't you tell me
what happened last night?

00:14:18,794 --> 00:14:21,530
I was on my way to the mall

00:14:21,597 --> 00:14:24,066
to get something
to eat.

00:14:24,132 --> 00:14:25,834
I always cut through
the construction site.

00:14:25,901 --> 00:14:28,670
My brother tells me not to,

00:14:28,737 --> 00:14:32,207
but it saves me,
like, ten minutes.

00:14:32,274 --> 00:14:34,076
That makes sense.

00:14:35,844 --> 00:14:37,879
What happened after that?

00:14:37,946 --> 00:14:44,419
Well, this guy from school,
Brian, comes out of nowhere.

00:14:44,486 --> 00:14:46,521
Do you know Brian's last name?

00:14:46,588 --> 00:14:47,723
Yeah. It's, um...

00:14:47,789 --> 00:14:50,792
Haddick.

00:14:50,859 --> 00:14:53,895
We were in homeroom together
freshman year.

00:14:53,962 --> 00:14:56,365
So, anyway,

00:14:56,431 --> 00:14:58,066
he says his cat

00:14:58,133 --> 00:15:00,302
ran away...

00:15:00,369 --> 00:15:03,705
and will I help him find it.

00:15:03,772 --> 00:15:05,874
And you did?

00:15:05,941 --> 00:15:07,876
( <i>sobbing softly and sniffling)</i>

00:15:07,943 --> 00:15:10,512
A cat. I'm so stupid.

00:15:10,579 --> 00:15:13,048
You're not stupid,
Ashley.

00:15:15,751 --> 00:15:18,353
I know this is hard.

00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:21,456
If we could just go over it
from start to finish

00:15:21,523 --> 00:15:23,692
just one time.

00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:31,466
So, we walked into the house...

00:15:31,533 --> 00:15:34,736
( <i>starting to sob</i> )

00:15:37,873 --> 00:15:39,141
I think I saw
him come in here.

00:15:39,207 --> 00:15:40,842
What color is he?

00:15:40,909 --> 00:15:41,977
BRIAN:
Gray.

00:15:42,044 --> 00:15:43,979
Here, kitty, kitty.

00:15:45,781 --> 00:15:47,416
You're going to like it,
you dirty bitch.

00:15:47,482 --> 00:15:49,418
You're going
to like it.

00:15:50,886 --> 00:15:52,421
( <i>sobbing</i> )

00:15:52,487 --> 00:15:55,290
It was like the more I shouted,

00:15:55,357 --> 00:15:58,927
the more he liked it.

00:16:06,368 --> 00:16:08,403
Rape is not about sex.

00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:10,439
It's about violence.

00:16:15,844 --> 00:16:18,413
You were against the wall.

00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,916
( <i>crying</i> ):
No!

00:16:27,489 --> 00:16:30,058
Did you see who hit Brian?

00:16:33,428 --> 00:16:36,164
Ashley, after all
that had happened,

00:16:36,231 --> 00:16:38,533
you went shopping?

00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,502
He was all over me.

00:16:40,569 --> 00:16:43,505
I just had to get him off me.

00:16:43,572 --> 00:16:44,673
( <i>sobbing</i> )

00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:47,876
And you got some coffee
and some earrings.

00:16:50,145 --> 00:16:52,147
What?

00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:56,985
I bought that stuff?

00:16:59,221 --> 00:17:06,728
All I remember is getting
new clothes and going home.

00:17:06,795 --> 00:17:08,363
Why does all
this bad stuff

00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:10,999
keep happening
to my family?

00:17:11,066 --> 00:17:13,936
She's covering for her brother.

00:17:14,002 --> 00:17:17,506
He's got a non-
confirmable alibi.

00:17:17,573 --> 00:17:18,974
I'm sure she
doesn't want to lose

00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:20,342
the only guardian she's got.

00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,585
It's pretty obvious

00:17:29,651 --> 00:17:32,120
the initial blows
were to the head.

00:17:32,187 --> 00:17:33,155
Well, according
to Sara,

00:17:33,221 --> 00:17:34,990
that's consistent
with the girl's story.

00:17:35,057 --> 00:17:37,492
Whoever attacked him
just kept going.

00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:39,628
Used some real force.

00:17:39,695 --> 00:17:43,031
Severed his spinal cord
at Cl, C2.

00:17:43,098 --> 00:17:45,000
Well, that would have
rendered him immobile.

00:17:45,067 --> 00:17:46,401
Right, so why
keep hitting?

00:17:46,468 --> 00:17:48,103
The epidermis

00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:50,606
was disturbed,
leaving areas

00:17:50,672 --> 00:17:53,041
of exposed derma,
which we'd normally see

00:17:53,108 --> 00:17:55,043
as red or purple
abrasions.

00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:58,981
But in this case,
no blood rushed to the area.

00:17:59,047 --> 00:18:00,616
He was beaten
postmortem.

00:18:00,682 --> 00:18:02,251
Right.

00:18:02,317 --> 00:18:03,952
So, Gregory Curtwell

00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:06,622
sees Brian attacking his sister.

00:18:06,688 --> 00:18:10,525
His adrenaline starts going,
and he can't stop.

00:18:10,592 --> 00:18:14,429
Well, Brian may have gotten off
a punch of his own.

00:18:14,496 --> 00:18:16,798
I can't identify
the pattern,

00:18:16,865 --> 00:18:18,367
but I sent

00:18:18,433 --> 00:18:20,068
blood and skin transfer to Greg.

00:18:20,135 --> 00:18:23,906
And you're going
to need these.

00:18:23,972 --> 00:18:26,475
Thanks.

00:18:32,514 --> 00:18:34,483
That's our son.

00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:37,052
Who could
have done this

00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:39,221
to my baby?

00:18:40,822 --> 00:18:42,391
Do you recognize this girl?

00:18:46,662 --> 00:18:49,498
Did Brian ever mention
the name Ashley Curtwell?

00:18:49,564 --> 00:18:53,635
He got a little out of hand
for a while.

00:18:53,702 --> 00:18:56,138
We couldn't keep track
of his friends.

00:18:56,204 --> 00:18:58,173
"Out of hand"?

00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,209
I found some marijuana
in his room.

00:19:01,276 --> 00:19:02,377
Broke curfew.

00:19:02,444 --> 00:19:05,814
The nipple piercing
was the last straw.

00:19:05,881 --> 00:19:07,916
I told him
he could do anything

00:19:07,983 --> 00:19:10,352
he wanted to the body
God gave him

00:19:10,419 --> 00:19:11,687
once he moved out.

00:19:11,753 --> 00:19:12,921
Until then...

00:19:12,988 --> 00:19:14,289
He was grounded.

00:19:14,356 --> 00:19:17,459
But he was doing
so much better.

00:19:17,526 --> 00:19:20,262
His grades were up.

00:19:20,329 --> 00:19:21,697
He got a job.

00:19:21,763 --> 00:19:22,965
Where did he work?

00:19:23,031 --> 00:19:25,300
MR. HADDICK:
My brother
owns a restaurant.

00:19:25,367 --> 00:19:29,137
Got him a job
bussing and waiting tables.

00:19:29,204 --> 00:19:31,673
500 bucks every two weeks.

00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:34,109
Cash under the table.

00:19:34,176 --> 00:19:35,911
Pretty good for a
kid who can't drive.

00:19:35,978 --> 00:19:37,713
( <i>sobbing</i> )

00:19:40,382 --> 00:19:43,518
DAWSON:
No GSR on either the husband's

00:19:43,585 --> 00:19:44,553
or ex-husband's hands.

00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,687
STOKES:
That's not
definitive.

00:19:45,754 --> 00:19:47,389
One of them still
could have fired the gun

00:19:47,456 --> 00:19:48,790
and washed his hands.

00:19:48,857 --> 00:19:49,958
Yeah.

00:19:50,025 --> 00:19:52,060
Well, you know,
you asked me to check

00:19:52,127 --> 00:19:54,096
Marlene Mitchell's bullet
for trace?

00:19:54,162 --> 00:19:55,364
Well, there isn't any.

00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:56,965
It's in pristine condition.

00:19:57,032 --> 00:19:59,501
The only reason for
shallow penetration

00:19:59,568 --> 00:20:00,836
is loss of momentum.

00:20:00,903 --> 00:20:03,372
Yeah, and it was a standard
full metal jacket,

00:20:03,438 --> 00:20:04,573
not a pre-fragmented.

00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,142
So, assuming
that the bullet

00:20:07,209 --> 00:20:11,713
didn't come in contact
with any intervening object,

00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,582
what slowed it down?

00:20:13,649 --> 00:20:16,718
Hey, Sanders, you
got anything on
that knuckle sludge?

00:20:16,785 --> 00:20:18,020
Grissom's asking.

00:20:18,086 --> 00:20:19,488
Yeah, a skin sample

00:20:19,554 --> 00:20:22,324
taken from Brian Haddick's
defensive wounds, hair samples

00:20:22,391 --> 00:20:23,358
from Ashley
Curtwell,

00:20:23,425 --> 00:20:24,660
and buccal swab
collected

00:20:24,726 --> 00:20:25,961
from Gregory Curtwell.

00:20:26,028 --> 00:20:27,963
No match to the brother
or sister.

00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,898
Construction worker
didn't do it.

00:20:29,965 --> 00:20:33,302
Or he didn't do it alone.

00:20:36,939 --> 00:20:38,807
72-degree impact angle

00:20:38,874 --> 00:20:42,210
puts Brian here
for the initial blows.

00:20:46,682 --> 00:20:48,550
Width is three millimeters.

00:20:48,617 --> 00:20:51,386
Length is six.

00:20:53,288 --> 00:20:55,524
Arcsine gives us

00:20:55,591 --> 00:20:56,892
30 degrees.

00:20:56,959 --> 00:21:00,028
So, Brian was crawling.

00:21:01,797 --> 00:21:04,366
That must be
where his neck was exposed.

00:21:07,803 --> 00:21:12,241
He ended up here on the floor
with his spinal cord severed.

00:21:12,307 --> 00:21:14,142
Well, if he
was laying down,

00:21:14,209 --> 00:21:17,546
this looks too high
to be a spatter.

00:21:17,613 --> 00:21:19,248
Must be cast-off.

00:21:19,314 --> 00:21:22,751
SIDLE:
On three walls.

00:21:22,818 --> 00:21:25,721
Assailants tend to move
only in reaction to a target,

00:21:25,787 --> 00:21:28,890
Brian was stationary.

00:21:28,957 --> 00:21:30,359
Why would the attacker
keep moving?

00:21:30,425 --> 00:21:31,426
It doesn't make sense.

00:21:31,493 --> 00:21:35,264
It does
if there were three hammers

00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:37,599
and three attackers.

00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:53,893
Hey, Catherine,

00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,695
feel like doin'
some real work?

00:21:55,761 --> 00:21:57,964
And leave all this?

00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:00,166
I got a woman who DFO'd
in front of her house

00:22:00,232 --> 00:22:01,834
trying to break up a fight.

00:22:01,901 --> 00:22:04,170
It's a single gunshot wound
to the chest.

00:22:04,236 --> 00:22:06,105
The penetration is...

00:22:06,172 --> 00:22:07,340
shallow.

00:22:07,406 --> 00:22:09,008
I want to know why.

00:22:09,075 --> 00:22:10,810
And you want me to cook?

00:22:34,934 --> 00:22:36,936
( <i>whirring</i> )

00:23:26,986 --> 00:23:28,287
( <i>snaps</i> )

00:23:42,835 --> 00:23:44,370
Okay, boys.

00:23:44,437 --> 00:23:46,706
There's always room
for Jell-O.

00:23:46,772 --> 00:23:48,708
Oh, yeah.
Uh, Catherine,

00:23:48,774 --> 00:23:50,309
technically,
that's just gel.

00:23:50,376 --> 00:23:51,911
I wasn't planning on eating it.

00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,115
Okay, let's shoot it.

00:23:58,718 --> 00:24:00,386
Betty Crocker.

00:24:12,231 --> 00:24:14,233
Firing one at 100%!

00:24:19,905 --> 00:24:21,574
Standard velocity

00:24:21,641 --> 00:24:24,010
is 1,100 feet per second.

00:24:25,811 --> 00:24:29,282
All right, that is a... 12-inch

00:24:29,348 --> 00:24:31,083
penetration.

00:24:32,385 --> 00:24:34,153
So...

00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,521
a, um...

00:24:35,588 --> 00:24:38,758
100% load gives us 12 inches.

00:24:38,824 --> 00:24:40,693
Firing one

00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,395
at 70%!

00:24:45,398 --> 00:24:48,768
Seven and three-quarter inches.

00:24:48,834 --> 00:24:50,569
Firing one at 40%!

00:24:59,045 --> 00:25:00,846
STOKES:
500 and...

00:25:00,913 --> 00:25:03,950
50 feet per second.

00:25:04,016 --> 00:25:05,051
Four inches.

00:25:05,117 --> 00:25:08,020
Same as Ms. Mitchell.

00:25:08,087 --> 00:25:10,323
So Mrs. Mitchell was shot
by a bullet

00:25:10,389 --> 00:25:12,658
traveling 550 feet per second.

00:25:12,725 --> 00:25:15,161
Now that we know the speed,
we can calculate the distance.

00:25:15,227 --> 00:25:16,562
Thanks, Catherine.

00:25:18,264 --> 00:25:20,333
So standard velocity
for a nine millimeter bullet

00:25:20,399 --> 00:25:23,002
is 1,100 feet per second.

00:25:23,069 --> 00:25:25,338
How far does a nine millimeter
bullet have to travel

00:25:25,404 --> 00:25:28,841
before it slows down
to 550 feet per second?

00:25:28,908 --> 00:25:30,943
Let's see.

00:25:32,411 --> 00:25:33,913
1,800 feet.

00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:36,849
Whoa. We're talking
six football fields.

00:25:36,916 --> 00:25:39,518
Yeah, that would pretty much
eliminate anyone

00:25:39,585 --> 00:25:41,687
that was in the Mitchells'
front yard.

00:25:41,754 --> 00:25:45,558
Can a nine millimeter bullet
even travel that far?

00:25:45,625 --> 00:25:46,792
Hang on.

00:25:48,628 --> 00:25:50,096
All right.

00:25:51,564 --> 00:25:54,400
If a nine millimeter
were fired straight...

00:25:56,269 --> 00:25:58,070
it'd go about 600 feet

00:25:58,137 --> 00:25:59,538
before gravity brought it down,

00:25:59,605 --> 00:26:01,507
but if a bullet
were fired

00:26:01,574 --> 00:26:04,143
at an angle...

00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:06,545
could go a heck of a lot
further.

00:26:06,612 --> 00:26:09,548
That would account for
the distance, but Ms. Mitchell

00:26:09,615 --> 00:26:11,250
was shot

00:26:11,317 --> 00:26:12,485
at an 85-degree angle.

00:26:12,551 --> 00:26:15,221
That's basically perpendicular.

00:26:15,288 --> 00:26:16,656
Um...

00:26:16,722 --> 00:26:19,058
bullets are predictable.

00:26:20,226 --> 00:26:22,795
People... aren't.

00:26:26,532 --> 00:26:27,633
No, stop it!

00:26:29,969 --> 00:26:34,073
I assumed she was standing.

00:26:36,709 --> 00:26:39,145
Okay, this is the
Mitchells' house,

00:26:39,211 --> 00:26:41,681
and by all
eyewitness accounts,

00:26:41,747 --> 00:26:43,349
she was standing
in front the house,

00:26:43,416 --> 00:26:46,619
facing away north,
when she was shot,

00:26:46,686 --> 00:26:49,622
so this line
represents
the 1,800 feet

00:26:49,689 --> 00:26:51,624
our bullet traveled.

00:26:51,691 --> 00:26:54,193
It had to have come
from somewhere...

00:26:55,227 --> 00:26:58,030
...on that arc.

00:26:59,065 --> 00:27:02,535
Good luck
knocking on doors.

00:27:04,403 --> 00:27:05,705
Here I'm looking
for three guys,

00:27:05,771 --> 00:27:07,673
but you only found
one hammer with
blood on it,

00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,041
so who do you
want me to follow?

00:27:09,108 --> 00:27:10,610
Me.

00:27:11,644 --> 00:27:13,312
What's up?

00:27:13,379 --> 00:27:15,481
The shoe tread I
found at the scene--

00:27:15,548 --> 00:27:17,316
it's a World
Industries Diablo.

00:27:17,383 --> 00:27:19,285
It's a skate shoe.

00:27:19,352 --> 00:27:20,519
Size 11.

00:27:20,586 --> 00:27:21,954
On a construction worker?

00:27:22,021 --> 00:27:23,256
Screams teenager, I know.

00:27:23,322 --> 00:27:26,492
Why is Gregory Curtwell
hanging out with teenage boys?

00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:28,694
Well, he has a teenage sister.

00:27:28,761 --> 00:27:30,529
And the sister
and Brian Haddick

00:27:30,596 --> 00:27:32,431
were both students
at McKinley High.

00:27:32,498 --> 00:27:36,535
I bet the shoe
also goes to school there.

00:27:43,876 --> 00:27:45,511
Nice kicks. I like those.

00:27:45,578 --> 00:27:47,313
You guys play ball?
BOY:
Yeah.

00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:50,216
Yeah?
BOY:
Uh-huh.

00:27:50,283 --> 00:27:52,018
Nice backpack.
BOY:
Thanks.

00:27:52,084 --> 00:27:53,653
<i>We're treading</i>

00:27:53,719 --> 00:27:55,888
a razor-thin line
of illegal search
and seizure here.

00:27:55,955 --> 00:27:57,290
Now, I'm not arguing
with you,

00:27:57,356 --> 00:28:00,793
but shoes
are a plain-view item.

00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:03,296
Anyway, here's the guy who's
going to be investigating...

00:28:03,362 --> 00:28:05,398
Tyler, come on, we're going.

00:28:05,464 --> 00:28:07,867
Are you crazy?

00:28:07,934 --> 00:28:09,135
Do you know
what my law firm does?

00:28:09,201 --> 00:28:11,337
You can't question these kids
without a parent present.

00:28:11,404 --> 00:28:13,406
We're not questioning
them, which is why
you're here--

00:28:13,472 --> 00:28:16,742
so we can.
Oh. And I'm holding you
responsible.

00:28:16,809 --> 00:28:18,311
Clark County Law
Enforcement and I

00:28:18,377 --> 00:28:20,346
have taken every
precaution to make sure

00:28:20,413 --> 00:28:22,315
that these students'
rights were not violated.

00:28:22,381 --> 00:28:23,316
You are sequestering

00:28:23,382 --> 00:28:24,750
these kids
without probable cause.

00:28:24,817 --> 00:28:25,918
I hate

00:28:25,985 --> 00:28:28,487
that I've been called
out of work to come down here,

00:28:28,554 --> 00:28:30,823
and I'm going to be
so far up your ass,
you're not going to be able

00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:32,692
to sit down straight.
You know what I hate?

00:28:32,758 --> 00:28:34,427
People who hurt kids.

00:28:35,795 --> 00:28:37,730
And you know who those
people sometimes are?

00:28:37,797 --> 00:28:38,864
Cops?

00:28:38,931 --> 00:28:40,533
Other kids.

00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,834
If it had been your son

00:28:41,901 --> 00:28:43,669
whose skull was smashed
in with a hammer,

00:28:43,736 --> 00:28:45,004
you'd be asking
me where I was

00:28:45,071 --> 00:28:46,672
when I should've
been protecting him.

00:28:46,739 --> 00:28:49,675
Kids bring guns
to school to
shoot other kids,

00:28:49,742 --> 00:28:51,611
so who are you
protecting?

00:28:51,677 --> 00:28:53,779
Let's discuss it in court.

00:28:57,516 --> 00:28:59,018
Well, way to clear a room.

00:28:59,085 --> 00:29:00,720
Those of you

00:29:00,786 --> 00:29:02,255
with parents here
are dismissed,

00:29:02,321 --> 00:29:04,824
and the rest of you
please wait here.

00:29:14,033 --> 00:29:15,501
Brass.

00:29:19,872 --> 00:29:21,307
Check this out.

00:29:23,676 --> 00:29:24,944
Hey, bud.

00:29:26,379 --> 00:29:27,413
What's your name?

00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,148
Benny.

00:29:29,215 --> 00:29:30,816
Benny, where's your father?
Is he around?

00:29:30,883 --> 00:29:33,286
Uh, he's at home.
Probably called in drunk.

00:29:33,352 --> 00:29:34,754
Well, lucky for you,

00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:36,656
we make house calls.

00:29:38,557 --> 00:29:40,760
BENNY:
<i>Dad?</i>

00:29:52,905 --> 00:29:56,742
You good for nothing
little bastard...

00:29:56,809 --> 00:29:58,678
I knew you stole
that game thing.

00:29:58,744 --> 00:30:00,279
125 bucks, my ass.

00:30:00,346 --> 00:30:03,282
I told you. I bought that
with my own money.

00:30:03,349 --> 00:30:04,250
You talkin' back to me?

00:30:04,317 --> 00:30:04,951
Huh?

00:30:05,017 --> 00:30:06,185
Hey...
BRASS:
Let's sit down.

00:30:06,252 --> 00:30:07,587
Let's all sit down.

00:30:07,653 --> 00:30:09,589
Come on.

00:30:15,595 --> 00:30:16,862
Look, I'll take this.

00:30:16,929 --> 00:30:20,032
Let 'em argue diminished
capacity after the fact.

00:30:20,099 --> 00:30:22,034
You think they know
how a DNA test works?

00:30:22,101 --> 00:30:23,369
I don't know.
Let's find out.

00:30:23,436 --> 00:30:25,438
Mr. Lizzio,
do you mind

00:30:25,504 --> 00:30:28,841
if we test Benny's
sneaker for DNA?

00:30:28,908 --> 00:30:31,410
You do what you got
to do, officers.

00:30:33,412 --> 00:30:35,014
Lift your right shoe, please.

00:31:01,207 --> 00:31:02,642
We got a problem.

00:31:02,708 --> 00:31:04,577
The blood on your shoe

00:31:04,644 --> 00:31:06,112
is a match to
Brian Haddick's.

00:31:07,146 --> 00:31:10,650
DNA doesn't lie.

00:31:10,716 --> 00:31:12,685
So, do you
want to tell us

00:31:12,752 --> 00:31:14,020
how a dead kid's blood

00:31:14,086 --> 00:31:16,155
ended up on the bottom
of your sneaker, Benny?

00:31:16,222 --> 00:31:19,258
Yeah, Benny. Why don't
you tell us that?

00:31:22,595 --> 00:31:25,197
Sometimes I go
to the construction site

00:31:25,264 --> 00:31:26,933
just to hang out.

00:31:36,809 --> 00:31:40,780
So, you just, uh...
happened upon it?

00:31:40,846 --> 00:31:42,214
Didn't report
it to anybody?

00:31:42,281 --> 00:31:44,050
I was trespassing.

00:31:44,116 --> 00:31:45,918
I didn't want
to get in trouble.

00:31:45,985 --> 00:31:50,556
Mr. Lizzio, would you mind
if I took a look around?

00:31:50,623 --> 00:31:53,125
Be my guest.

00:31:56,028 --> 00:31:58,064
Mr. Lizzio,
why don't you sit down?

00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:00,099
We're going
to be a while, okay?

00:32:00,166 --> 00:32:02,401
You been drinking today,
Mr. Lizzio?

00:32:02,468 --> 00:32:03,669
Couple of beers.

00:32:49,615 --> 00:32:51,751
Practice makes perfect.

00:32:56,665 --> 00:33:01,469
So, Benny, for the record,
you've waived your right

00:33:01,536 --> 00:33:03,271
to have your parent
or an advocate present.

00:33:03,338 --> 00:33:04,472
Yep.

00:33:04,539 --> 00:33:06,408
So, how do you know Brian?

00:33:06,474 --> 00:33:09,611
We hung out a few times
when we were freshmen.

00:33:09,678 --> 00:33:11,279
You know Gregory Curtwell?

00:33:11,346 --> 00:33:12,480
Ashley's brother? Yeah.

00:33:12,547 --> 00:33:14,216
He bought me beer
a couple times.

00:33:14,282 --> 00:33:15,884
Oh, so you know
Ashley, too?

00:33:15,951 --> 00:33:17,219
Yeah.

00:33:17,285 --> 00:33:19,554
I'm a friendly guy.
Well, that's
good, Benny,

00:33:19,621 --> 00:33:20,722
because...

00:33:20,789 --> 00:33:21,857
( <i>clears throat</i> )

00:33:21,923 --> 00:33:23,124
...you're looking at murder.

00:33:23,191 --> 00:33:24,693
And if you're friendly
and you cooperate,

00:33:24,759 --> 00:33:26,494
and you tell me
what happened to Brian Haddick,

00:33:26,561 --> 00:33:27,562
maybe I can cut you a deal.

00:33:27,629 --> 00:33:30,031
Ain't gonna happen.

00:33:30,098 --> 00:33:31,766
I'm no snitch.

00:33:31,833 --> 00:33:34,336
You want to tell me about
those melons at your house?

00:33:34,402 --> 00:33:36,271
You looking to be
another Gallagher?

00:33:36,338 --> 00:33:38,073
You know who that is?

00:33:38,139 --> 00:33:40,675
Since when is whacking fruit
a crime?

00:33:40,742 --> 00:33:42,677
When it's practice
for whacking people.

00:33:42,744 --> 00:33:46,681
Your hammer had Brian's
blood all over it.

00:33:46,748 --> 00:33:48,316
Understand something, Benny,

00:33:48,383 --> 00:33:53,321
I'm talking about months versus
years of juvenile detention.

00:33:53,388 --> 00:33:54,623
It's your call.

00:33:57,459 --> 00:33:59,794
They got cable?

00:33:59,861 --> 00:34:01,263
Food?

00:34:01,329 --> 00:34:03,465
My dad locked on the outside?

00:34:05,934 --> 00:34:09,304
Sounds good to me.

00:34:09,371 --> 00:34:12,107
Besides, I'm a minor.

00:34:12,173 --> 00:34:14,309
By the time
I'm 21,

00:34:14,376 --> 00:34:17,913
it's like it never happened.

00:34:20,949 --> 00:34:22,284
Did he roll?

00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:24,352
Brass says the kid is looking
forward to going to jail.

00:34:24,419 --> 00:34:25,854
Hmm.

00:34:25,921 --> 00:34:28,523
So, what do we got here?

00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:31,059
It's hard to tell
what's relevant

00:34:31,126 --> 00:34:33,728
and what's trash here.

00:34:33,795 --> 00:34:35,463
This is everything
we brought back

00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:37,499
from Benny's party room.

00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:42,571
Are these...?

00:34:42,637 --> 00:34:43,572
SpaghettiOs?

00:34:43,638 --> 00:34:45,540
I don't think so.

00:34:45,607 --> 00:34:48,376
SANDERS:
Nah. Nah, those would be
orthodontic rubber bands.

00:34:48,443 --> 00:34:50,512
Hook 'em to your braces,
uh, upper to lower.

00:34:50,579 --> 00:34:52,547
Helps pull the jaw
in the right direction.

00:34:52,614 --> 00:34:53,748
Also great for flinging.

00:34:53,815 --> 00:34:55,417
Yeah, I had
it all--

00:34:55,483 --> 00:34:57,485
palate expander,
braces,

00:34:57,552 --> 00:34:58,987
retainer, head gear.

00:34:59,054 --> 00:35:00,889
Ah, five years of misery,

00:35:00,956 --> 00:35:02,624
but worth every penny,
don't you think?

00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:08,430
Um, there might be
some saliva residue on them.

00:35:08,496 --> 00:35:11,032
I can see what I can pull off,
if you want.

00:35:11,099 --> 00:35:12,033
SIDLE:
Yeah. Would you?

00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,168
SANDERS:
Well, you're going

00:35:13,235 --> 00:35:14,269
to need something.

00:35:14,336 --> 00:35:16,004
Strike three
on the knuckles.

00:35:16,071 --> 00:35:18,573
Benny's DNA doesn't match.
Gregory's doesn't match.

00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,208
Ashley's doesn't match.

00:35:20,275 --> 00:35:22,043
Who did this guy hit?

00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:23,378
Greg, test both of these.

00:35:23,445 --> 00:35:25,080
If a third guy has braces,

00:35:25,146 --> 00:35:27,649
it may explain the
strange pattern

00:35:27,716 --> 00:35:28,917
on Brian's hand.

00:35:28,984 --> 00:35:31,419
It's probably another student,
but Benny's not talking.

00:35:31,486 --> 00:35:32,854
BROWN:
Benny has a party room, right?

00:35:32,921 --> 00:35:34,856
You can't have a party
without the music.

00:35:34,923 --> 00:35:37,459
I found some new CDs
in his room.

00:35:41,296 --> 00:35:42,797
What's "C &amp; D"?

00:35:42,864 --> 00:35:45,934
It's like a music club,
12 CDs for the price of one.

00:35:48,537 --> 00:35:51,273
And Aaron Gilbert was...?

00:35:53,441 --> 00:35:54,809
The deejay maybe?

00:35:54,876 --> 00:35:56,278
SIDLE:
You know,
at this time of year,

00:35:56,344 --> 00:35:58,480
watermelon isn't cheap,
particularly organic.

00:35:58,547 --> 00:36:00,148
Maybe the music
isn't the only thing

00:36:00,215 --> 00:36:01,149
that Aaron Gilbert

00:36:01,216 --> 00:36:02,517
brought to the party.

00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:09,724
WOMAN:
<i>Yeah, I heard gunfire</i>

00:36:09,791 --> 00:36:12,160
a couple of days ago.

00:36:12,227 --> 00:36:13,495
Johnnie, the idiot behind us,

00:36:13,562 --> 00:36:15,397
was playing like G.I. Joe
in his backyard.

00:36:15,463 --> 00:36:17,632
I screamed out my window.

00:36:17,699 --> 00:36:19,801
I got kids, you know?

00:36:19,868 --> 00:36:21,269
Why do you want to know?

00:36:21,336 --> 00:36:22,470
Just curious.

00:36:22,537 --> 00:36:24,439
She called
you guys, right?

00:36:24,506 --> 00:36:26,441
It's like having a wife.

00:36:26,508 --> 00:36:27,943
Gun's brand-new.

00:36:28,009 --> 00:36:29,778
Shot it one time.

00:36:29,844 --> 00:36:32,247
She told me to
stop, I stopped.

00:36:32,314 --> 00:36:34,549
Sir, you're going to have
to tell us where that gun is.

00:36:41,189 --> 00:36:42,457
And this is the gun
that you fired?

00:36:42,524 --> 00:36:43,825
Yeah.

00:36:50,832 --> 00:36:53,068
Empty ten-round magazine.

00:36:53,134 --> 00:36:54,436
It was full when you started?

00:36:54,502 --> 00:36:56,771
Yeah.

00:36:56,838 --> 00:37:01,042
( <i>gun clip clacking</i> )

00:37:07,315 --> 00:37:10,652
I, uh, only count nine holes
in your target.

00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:13,455
I must have missed one.

00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:15,323
Oh, you didn't miss.

00:37:21,396 --> 00:37:24,299
Hey! You want to kill someone?!
( <i>gunshot</i> )

00:37:24,366 --> 00:37:26,234
<i>Put that thing away!</i>

00:37:29,237 --> 00:37:30,205
( <i>yells</i> )

00:37:30,272 --> 00:37:33,808
VEGA:
Just nice and easy.

00:37:33,875 --> 00:37:35,443
You see, your neighbor
didn't lose her kid,

00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:37,012
but six blocks away,
a guy lost his wife.

00:37:37,078 --> 00:37:39,014
It was just
a little target practice.

00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,181
And that's why

00:37:40,248 --> 00:37:41,983
it's illegal
to discharge firearms

00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:43,752
within the city limits, genius.

00:37:52,761 --> 00:37:53,895
Aaron Gilbert?

00:37:53,962 --> 00:37:55,697
Yeah.
I'm Detective
Brass,

00:37:55,764 --> 00:37:57,199
Las Vegas Police.

00:37:57,265 --> 00:37:58,833
We need to talk.

00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,001
Oh, dude, I got to get home.

00:38:00,068 --> 00:38:02,337
My mom's waiting
for me and my brother.

00:38:02,404 --> 00:38:03,672
Oh, we talked to your mom.

00:38:03,738 --> 00:38:05,140
Yeah, she gave us
your hammer and this.

00:38:08,443 --> 00:38:09,778
BOY:
Yo, dawg,

00:38:09,844 --> 00:38:10,946
we going or what?

00:38:13,982 --> 00:38:15,650
Or what... dawg.

00:38:17,285 --> 00:38:19,654
That's a nice Walkman
you had.

00:38:19,721 --> 00:38:21,923
What'd that cost?
125 bucks?

00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:23,725
Same as Benny's Gameboy.

00:38:23,792 --> 00:38:26,494
Same as your brother's
secret stash.

00:38:29,464 --> 00:38:30,565
Speaking of Benny,

00:38:30,632 --> 00:38:33,268
he's not too smart, is he?

00:38:33,335 --> 00:38:35,036
He wouldn't give up
you and your brother

00:38:35,103 --> 00:38:36,071
for a lesser sentence.

00:38:36,137 --> 00:38:37,072
You know what?

00:38:37,138 --> 00:38:38,540
There's an opportunity here,

00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:40,442
and I think you got
more on the ball

00:38:40,508 --> 00:38:42,611
than Benny.

00:38:42,677 --> 00:38:45,013
Tell me what happened.

00:38:48,016 --> 00:38:54,004
Jared...
ain't braces a bitch?

00:38:54,322 --> 00:38:55,957
I see that cut on your lip.

00:38:56,024 --> 00:38:57,826
Is that where Brian hit you?

00:39:00,529 --> 00:39:03,398
They do make
for a good impression though.

00:39:03,465 --> 00:39:06,001
See all these grooves here?

00:39:06,067 --> 00:39:09,838
It's perfect
for storing DNA.

00:39:09,905 --> 00:39:13,642
That would be your DNA.

00:39:16,578 --> 00:39:20,115
Look, Jared, I'm not a cop,

00:39:20,181 --> 00:39:22,350
but if you tell me
what happened,

00:39:22,417 --> 00:39:24,786
I will put in a good word
for you.

00:39:27,689 --> 00:39:28,857
SIDLE:
We have a problem.

00:39:28,924 --> 00:39:30,859
We have three hammers
and four suspects.

00:39:30,926 --> 00:39:32,527
BROWN:
Well, the
Gilbert brothers

00:39:32,594 --> 00:39:34,262
both seem ready
to go down for it.

00:39:34,329 --> 00:39:36,498
BRASS:
And Benny can't wait
to go to jail.

00:39:36,565 --> 00:39:39,100
If they were defending Ashley
against an attacker,

00:39:39,167 --> 00:39:40,101
why not say so?

00:39:40,168 --> 00:39:41,169
GRISSOM:
They weren't.

00:39:41,236 --> 00:39:43,271
The smashed watermelon
suggests the whole thing

00:39:43,338 --> 00:39:44,272
was premeditated.

00:39:44,339 --> 00:39:46,208
Making the motive robbery?

00:39:46,274 --> 00:39:48,343
BROWN:
Well, Benny,
Aaron and Jared

00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:51,446
each had about $125 worth
of cash and assorted prizes.

00:39:51,513 --> 00:39:54,349
GRISSOM:
$375.

00:39:54,416 --> 00:39:58,153
Brian's parents said that
he was being paid $500

00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,487
every two weeks.

00:39:59,554 --> 00:40:00,488
Cash under the table.

00:40:00,555 --> 00:40:05,060
It was payday,
so who got the other $125?

00:40:05,126 --> 00:40:07,362
Well, Gregory Curtwell
makes good money.

00:40:07,429 --> 00:40:08,530
125 bucks

00:40:08,597 --> 00:40:09,764
is a spit
in the ocean

00:40:09,831 --> 00:40:11,266
for a construction
worker.

00:40:11,333 --> 00:40:13,235
If he wasn't
defending his sister,

00:40:13,301 --> 00:40:14,402
then he has no motive.

00:40:14,469 --> 00:40:16,004
BRASS:
Well, if he
didn't do it,

00:40:16,071 --> 00:40:18,473
how did his hammer end up
with Brian's blood on it?

00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:23,979
Clothing-- $85; earrings - $30;
coffee-- four dollars.

00:40:24,045 --> 00:40:25,981
Getting away with murder...

00:40:26,047 --> 00:40:28,183
Priceless.

00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:29,584
SIDLE:
That hand that holds
the wallet

00:40:29,651 --> 00:40:30,852
is the hand
that rules the world.

00:40:30,919 --> 00:40:32,888
Huh, Ashley?

00:40:35,223 --> 00:40:39,361
Your fingerprint
in Brian's blood

00:40:39,427 --> 00:40:41,396
on Jared's money.

00:40:41,463 --> 00:40:44,699
This is what we call
"completing the triangle."

00:40:44,766 --> 00:40:49,104
Okay. So he attacked me,
and I did see who defended me.

00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:52,073
But I didn't want
to get my friends
in trouble,

00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:55,610
and the money was for, like...

00:40:55,677 --> 00:40:57,746
like, pain and suffering.

00:40:57,812 --> 00:40:59,781
You weren't attacked, Ashley.
Brian was.

00:40:59,848 --> 00:41:01,349
We figured
none of the boys

00:41:01,416 --> 00:41:03,251
wore cotton candy,
so we had it tested.

00:41:03,318 --> 00:41:05,353
Turns out you were
at Benny's house, too.

00:41:07,255 --> 00:41:08,456
Let's do it!

you weren't in shock,
you were celebrating.

00:41:29,211 --> 00:41:32,414
Your brother was up in Tahoe
this past weekend, wasn't he?

00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,283
He goes away almost
every weekend.

00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:39,621
You know, I'm done
with the Ashley pity party.

00:41:39,688 --> 00:41:41,323
My guess is
Aaron and Jared

00:41:41,389 --> 00:41:42,624
only had one hammer,

00:41:42,691 --> 00:41:45,393
but you had access
to your brother's tools.

00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:47,696
Why Brian?

00:41:49,564 --> 00:41:52,500
Before he went straight,
we were buds,

00:41:52,567 --> 00:41:54,436
but then he got too good for us,

00:41:54,502 --> 00:41:57,772
but he wasn't too good
to want to get with this.

00:41:57,839 --> 00:41:58,940
Where do you want
to do it at?

00:41:59,007 --> 00:42:00,442
Right here.

00:42:00,508 --> 00:42:02,143

Do you know
how many people

00:42:29,738 --> 00:42:31,373
don't report a rape
because they're afraid

00:42:31,439 --> 00:42:32,674
that no one will believe them?

00:42:32,741 --> 00:42:34,109
Of course.

00:42:34,175 --> 00:42:36,645
It's what I was counting on.

I'm going to do everything
in my power

you're tried as an adult.

Good luck.

little lace collar,
two dead parents.
