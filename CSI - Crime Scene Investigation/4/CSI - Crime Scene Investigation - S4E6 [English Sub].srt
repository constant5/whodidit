00:01:01,996 --> 00:01:03,931
I heard you got some head.

00:01:03,998 --> 00:01:04,799
Just came in.

00:01:04,865 --> 00:01:05,699
How'd you know?

00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:06,967
I arranged
house seats

00:01:07,034 --> 00:01:08,102
for David to see Celine,

00:01:08,169 --> 00:01:10,104
so he pages me the minute
you get anything

00:01:10,171 --> 00:01:11,505
perishable.

00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:12,640
Sellout.

00:01:18,179 --> 00:01:19,880
Oh... formaldehyde.

00:01:19,947 --> 00:01:22,817
Yeah, it fixes tissue,
but it destroys DNA.

00:01:22,883 --> 00:01:24,151
No ID through CODIS.

00:01:24,218 --> 00:01:26,921
Quite a bit of leaf litter.

00:01:26,987 --> 00:01:29,990
Puncture wound
above the orbital plate.

00:01:30,057 --> 00:01:32,359
That looks like
animal activity.

00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:33,360
Heavy decomp.

00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:34,995
It's going to be, uh...

00:01:35,062 --> 00:01:38,365
virtually impossible
to determine time of death.

00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:39,667
This neck wasn't severed.

00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:40,835
It was disarticulated.

00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:43,037
No skill involved.

00:01:45,106 --> 00:01:46,373
Oh-oh.

00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,742
I take that back.

00:01:47,808 --> 00:01:50,478
That took skill.

00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:57,685

Hair roots and scalp
are relatively clean.

00:02:44,888 --> 00:02:46,323
So the vic wasn't buried?

00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:47,658
You tell me.

00:02:47,725 --> 00:02:48,892
I will.

00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,361
Leaves and needles and dirt--

00:02:51,428 --> 00:02:53,063
that's good as a map.

00:03:01,338 --> 00:03:02,606
Any idea
when Grissom'll be back?

00:03:02,673 --> 00:03:04,575
Nope.

00:03:04,641 --> 00:03:05,809
It's going to be a while.

00:03:07,077 --> 00:03:09,179
WILLOWS:
Jackpot, Nevada.

00:03:09,246 --> 00:03:11,281
Where the hell is that?

00:04:02,366 --> 00:04:05,636
( <i>country music plays faintly)</i>

00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:08,605
Good morning.

00:04:08,672 --> 00:04:10,240
I'm with the Las Vegas
Crime Lab, and I...

00:04:10,307 --> 00:04:11,241
Hey, Alan!

00:04:11,308 --> 00:04:12,776
This guy's here about the head.

00:04:14,511 --> 00:04:16,113
MAN:
Bet a wolf got him.

00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,415
MAN 2:
There's no wolves
around here, dumbass.

00:04:18,482 --> 00:04:19,883
Bears.

00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,752
Ten bucks says
satanic cult.

00:04:21,819 --> 00:04:22,886
Lieutenant Alan Brooks.

00:04:22,953 --> 00:04:24,254
This is my brother Leland.

00:04:24,321 --> 00:04:26,824
How do you do?
Gil Grissom,
Las Vegas Crime Lab.

00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:28,358
May I?

00:04:28,425 --> 00:04:29,593
Have a seat.

00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,994
Things must be
pretty slow

00:04:31,061 --> 00:04:33,130
in Vegas to get one of
you guys out here so quick.

00:04:33,197 --> 00:04:35,365
Well, the Elko County Sheriff
made the request.

00:04:35,432 --> 00:04:36,567
We were happy to respond.

00:04:36,633 --> 00:04:37,801
It's an interesting case.

00:04:37,868 --> 00:04:40,137
Mmm, not particularly.

00:04:40,204 --> 00:04:41,472
LELAND:
It was probably some hiker

00:04:41,538 --> 00:04:44,108
or transient who got lost,
took a bad luck fall.

00:04:44,174 --> 00:04:46,777
Must have been a heck of a fall.

00:04:46,844 --> 00:04:48,545
His head's in a plastic jar.

00:04:48,612 --> 00:04:50,180
BROOKS:
Listen, I filed
the report.

00:04:50,247 --> 00:04:51,348
I sent in the head.

00:04:51,415 --> 00:04:53,150
Five'll get you ten,
there's not much left

00:04:53,217 --> 00:04:54,885
of that body out there
but coyote turds.

00:04:54,952 --> 00:04:56,487
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:04:56,553 --> 00:04:59,323
Look, nobody from
this community's
been reported missing.

00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,191
And I just don't
have the resources

00:05:01,258 --> 00:05:03,060
to go searching
for what might be left.

00:05:03,127 --> 00:05:05,696
Well, you do now.

00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:08,399
There'd better be
a whole lot more
of you out there.

00:05:10,434 --> 00:05:12,102
Have a good one, Marty.

00:05:14,405 --> 00:05:17,641
Lieutenant,
the preliminary autopsy

00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:20,411
revealed a single,
straight, two-inch cut

00:05:20,477 --> 00:05:21,845
on the victim's jaw.

00:05:21,912 --> 00:05:24,515
It was a blade mark.

00:05:24,581 --> 00:05:28,051
So, there's not just a body out
there, there's also a killer.

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,456
HODGES:
Of all the plant life
gathered from the head,

00:05:32,523 --> 00:05:33,757
the conifers are the key.

00:05:33,824 --> 00:05:34,892
The one on the left--

00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:36,760
<i>Abies zasiocarpa.</i>

00:05:36,827 --> 00:05:38,362
The one on the right

00:05:38,429 --> 00:05:41,365
is <i>Picea engelmannii,</i>
Engelmann spruce.

00:05:41,432 --> 00:05:43,934
Spruce and fir trees.

00:05:44,001 --> 00:05:45,936
Typical mountain forest.

00:05:46,003 --> 00:05:48,505
Typical for 9,000
feet above sea level.

00:05:48,572 --> 00:05:51,442
The wood fragments are
either cottonwood or aspen.

00:05:51,508 --> 00:05:53,844
And aspens only grow in areas
that have been cleared.

00:05:53,911 --> 00:05:57,581
Fire, roads or... logging.

00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:00,551
After a major forest fire,

00:06:00,617 --> 00:06:03,620
manzanita bushes
grow like weeds for decades.

00:06:03,687 --> 00:06:06,156
No manzanita leaves here.

00:06:06,223 --> 00:06:07,858
Which means
that the head

00:06:07,925 --> 00:06:10,661
was on a damp north-facing
slope, at least 9,000 feet up,

00:06:10,728 --> 00:06:13,263
cleared, but not recently
exposed to fire.

00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:14,264
( <i>phone rings</i> )

00:06:14,331 --> 00:06:15,265
Grissom.

00:06:15,332 --> 00:06:16,366
WILLOWS:
Is the service

00:06:16,433 --> 00:06:17,401
actually bad out there

00:06:17,468 --> 00:06:18,902
or are you just
keeping your phone off?

00:06:18,969 --> 00:06:20,537
I'm sorry.
I should've called.

00:06:20,604 --> 00:06:22,239
This trip wouldn't
have anything to do

00:06:22,306 --> 00:06:24,241
with you ducking case reviews,
now would it?

00:06:24,308 --> 00:06:25,409
How can you think that?

00:06:25,476 --> 00:06:27,745
You wouldn't mind taking care
of those for me, would you?

00:06:27,811 --> 00:06:30,280
Oh, your job, my pay.
Why would I care?

00:06:30,347 --> 00:06:31,482
I'll make it up to you.

00:06:31,548 --> 00:06:32,783
Yeah, you had better.

00:06:40,557 --> 00:06:43,127
Hodges ID'd your leaf litter.

00:06:44,261 --> 00:06:47,631
Good. Thanks.
I owe you one.

00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:48,799
Trouble with the wife?

00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:49,800
Yeah.

00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:52,169
She hates it
when we're apart.

00:06:53,904 --> 00:06:55,939
GRISSOM:
So your dog found the head?

00:06:56,006 --> 00:06:57,641
WOMAN:
Well, Tripper's not exactly

00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,576
a Chihuahua.

00:06:59,643 --> 00:07:01,178
Goes where he wants,
comes back for dinner.

00:07:01,245 --> 00:07:03,514
Sometimes he brings
dinner back.

00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:06,116
Tripper!
Come on, buddy, dinner.

00:07:06,183 --> 00:07:09,086
Oh, what is it this time,
a rabbit or a possum?

00:07:09,153 --> 00:07:10,754
Is he okay?

00:07:10,821 --> 00:07:12,856
Well, he got a little lethargic
after chewing on that head.

00:07:12,923 --> 00:07:14,825
Took him to the vet,
ran some tests.

00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:15,826
He got better.

00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:16,960
I just want to keep
him that way.

00:07:17,027 --> 00:07:18,796
Where there's a head
there's got to be

00:07:18,862 --> 00:07:21,432
hands and feet, and sooner
or later, he'll dig 'em up.

00:07:21,498 --> 00:07:22,533
Or what's left of 'em.

00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:24,535
No offense, Sylvia,
but he's not exactly

00:07:24,601 --> 00:07:25,536
a scent hound.

00:07:25,602 --> 00:07:28,138
GRISSOM:
All animals can smell
rotting flesh.

00:07:28,205 --> 00:07:30,474
Studies have shown that
when domestic pets bring back

00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:32,109
human body parts,
usually the remains

00:07:32,176 --> 00:07:33,444
are within
a half-mile radius.

00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34,812
They do studies on that?

00:07:34,878 --> 00:07:36,480
It occurs more than you think.

00:07:36,547 --> 00:07:39,283
Have you noticed any buzzards
or vultures around?

00:07:39,349 --> 00:07:40,984
All the time.

00:07:41,051 --> 00:07:41,985
Thanks.

00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:48,826
BROOKS:
So, are we done here?

00:07:50,694 --> 00:07:51,795
This slope faces north,

00:07:51,862 --> 00:07:52,963
doesn't it?

00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:54,298
BROOKS:
Yeah.

00:07:54,364 --> 00:07:56,200
You know that old expression,
"heads will roll"?

00:07:56,266 --> 00:07:59,203
It's true--
especially downhill.

00:08:00,637 --> 00:08:03,640
Barry, drop the doughnut.

00:08:03,707 --> 00:08:05,509
You gotta earn your pay today.

00:08:12,082 --> 00:08:13,417
BROOKS:
Afraid you're going to
trip over something?

00:08:13,484 --> 00:08:14,551
GRISSOM:
I'm hoping.

00:08:14,618 --> 00:08:16,954
Bodies make good fertilizer.

00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,723
You often see fresh,
green shoots

00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:20,891
near a gravesite.

00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,927
Must be nice to know the answer
to every little thing.

00:08:23,994 --> 00:08:25,963
I prefer questions,
actually.

00:08:26,029 --> 00:08:28,565
And I don't,
I suppose.

00:08:28,632 --> 00:08:31,068
Remember that
waitress, Doris?

00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:34,538
Well, she's got an ex-husband
likes to smack her around

00:08:34,605 --> 00:08:35,939
every once in a while.

00:08:36,006 --> 00:08:38,142
High school's got
a dozen meth-heads

00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:39,943
who like boosting
motorcycles

00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,512
and then drag racing 'em

00:08:41,578 --> 00:08:45,082
down Main Street, when they
think nobody's watching.

00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:47,317
Fire chief's a closet pyro,
and so forth.

00:08:47,384 --> 00:08:49,219
See, I don't have a lot of time

00:08:49,286 --> 00:08:53,023
to ask questions about
buzzards and such.

00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:55,592
That's an aspen tree,

00:08:55,659 --> 00:08:57,294
in case you
were wondering.

00:08:57,361 --> 00:08:58,829
Lieutenant!
Over here.

00:09:02,132 --> 00:09:03,233
GRISSOM:
Step away from there,

00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,568
would you please, fellas?

00:09:04,635 --> 00:09:05,869
Don't disturb the scene.

00:09:05,936 --> 00:09:08,338
( <i>retching and coughing</i> )

00:09:14,278 --> 00:09:16,713
GRISSOM:
Carabid beetles.

00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:19,650
Second instar maggots.

00:09:25,155 --> 00:09:26,957
<i>Formica obscuripes.</i>

00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:28,792
BROOKS:
Let me guess.

00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:30,761
You like bugs?

00:09:30,828 --> 00:09:32,930
Yeah, I do.
They're perfect.

00:09:32,996 --> 00:09:35,466
They always do their jobs.

00:09:35,532 --> 00:09:37,568
This body's been here

00:09:37,634 --> 00:09:39,470
four to seven days.

00:09:39,536 --> 00:09:42,272
How deep would you say
this hole is, Lieutenant?

00:09:42,339 --> 00:09:48,112
I'd say about four feet,
depending on...

00:09:48,178 --> 00:09:49,780
how he's stuffed in there.

00:09:49,847 --> 00:09:52,349
Takes a fair amount
of dedication

00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:54,418
to dig a hole this deep up here,
don't you think?

00:09:54,485 --> 00:09:56,587
Unless the killer had help.

00:09:56,653 --> 00:09:57,654
Maybe.

00:10:05,662 --> 00:10:07,297
It's like you said--
he was cut.

00:10:07,364 --> 00:10:09,133
This blood's not from a cut.

00:10:09,199 --> 00:10:11,935
The drops imply
directionality.

00:10:12,002 --> 00:10:13,904
The stellated circles imply...

00:10:13,971 --> 00:10:15,539
<i>perpendicular impact.</i>

00:10:15,606 --> 00:10:16,607
<i>This spatter</i>

00:10:16,673 --> 00:10:18,475
is in direct line with
the victim's carotid.

00:10:18,542 --> 00:10:21,278
It's arterial spurt.

00:10:21,345 --> 00:10:23,814
Are you saying he was alive
when he was buried?

00:10:23,881 --> 00:10:26,617
I think that the cut
we found on his jaw...

00:10:26,683 --> 00:10:29,486
was a lure
to draw predators.

00:10:29,553 --> 00:10:31,054
( <i>screaming</i> )

00:10:33,457 --> 00:10:34,658
( <i>screaming</i> )

00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:42,032
This wasn't just murder.

00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:44,668
It was torture.

00:10:49,038 --> 00:10:51,106
BROOKS:
Hey, Einstein, we going

00:10:51,173 --> 00:10:53,375
to stand here all day or what?

00:10:54,843 --> 00:10:56,945
You're going to have
to be patient, Lieutenant.

00:10:57,012 --> 00:10:59,181
The scene hasn't been
released yet.

00:11:04,353 --> 00:11:05,854
You know, this may be

00:11:05,921 --> 00:11:08,824
a variation on an old Native
American form of punishment.

00:11:08,891 --> 00:11:10,893
The body was bound
and buried up to its neck.

00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,194
Tree sap

00:11:12,261 --> 00:11:15,564
was poured over the head
to attract ants.

00:11:15,631 --> 00:11:17,466
Punishment for what?

00:11:17,533 --> 00:11:18,634
You see?

00:11:18,701 --> 00:11:20,269
That's a good question.

00:11:22,638 --> 00:11:24,340
About time, Dale.

00:11:29,611 --> 00:11:31,313
You are the coroner,

00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,282
I presume.

00:11:33,349 --> 00:11:34,450
Mr. Grissom.

00:11:34,516 --> 00:11:35,617
Dr. Dale Sterling.

00:11:35,684 --> 00:11:36,885
I sent you the head.

00:11:38,654 --> 00:11:39,888
How can I help?

00:11:39,955 --> 00:11:43,826
Well, we can't touch the body
until you authorize it.

00:11:43,892 --> 00:11:45,361
Oh.

00:11:52,968 --> 00:11:54,069
He's dead.

00:11:54,136 --> 00:11:55,537
You're authorized.

00:11:55,604 --> 00:11:56,839
Thanks, Doc.
That's nice work.

00:11:56,905 --> 00:11:57,806
Can we get it out now?

00:11:57,873 --> 00:11:59,108
There may be evidence

00:11:59,174 --> 00:12:00,275
in the gravesite.

00:12:00,342 --> 00:12:01,443
We need to preserve it.

00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:05,280
Okay, so what do you want
to do, call your lab?

00:12:05,347 --> 00:12:06,648
Have them send
the right gear,

00:12:06,715 --> 00:12:07,649
the right guys, what?

00:12:07,716 --> 00:12:09,351
The site's already
been compromised.

00:12:09,418 --> 00:12:11,086
We'll make do
with what we have here.

00:12:11,153 --> 00:12:13,555
Now, for each foot of dirt
that's removed,

00:12:13,622 --> 00:12:14,823
go on a separate bag.

00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:16,525
I'll sift through it later.

00:12:16,592 --> 00:12:18,227
All right. Out
of the way, Doc.

00:12:18,293 --> 00:12:19,862
Pardon me.
Hold on.

00:12:19,928 --> 00:12:22,631
Make sure your shovels don't get
within six inches of that body.

00:12:22,698 --> 00:12:23,766
Can we please get on

00:12:23,832 --> 00:12:25,401
with getting him out of there?

00:12:25,467 --> 00:12:26,835
We're losing light.

00:12:42,685 --> 00:12:44,720
I was in the
99th percentile

00:12:44,787 --> 00:12:45,788
on the MCATs.

00:12:45,854 --> 00:12:48,057
I could have gone
to med school.

00:12:48,123 --> 00:12:50,392
I chose to be a vet.

00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:54,129
Well, veterinary school's harder
to get into than medical school.

00:12:54,196 --> 00:12:57,333
That's not
what I was looking at.

00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:00,202
This is you and that gal
from the diner.

00:13:00,269 --> 00:13:01,337
Doris.

00:13:01,403 --> 00:13:02,504
We were married.

00:13:02,571 --> 00:13:04,006
High school
sweethearts.

00:13:04,073 --> 00:13:06,208
Didn't work out.

00:13:09,945 --> 00:13:12,514
It's not all just cats and dogs
and spays and neuters.

00:13:12,581 --> 00:13:15,517
I've delivered half a dozen
foals by C-section.

00:13:15,584 --> 00:13:17,119
I know how to cut.

00:13:17,186 --> 00:13:20,422
I could... I could do
the autopsy right here.

00:13:20,489 --> 00:13:24,159
Only a licensed pathologist
can perform an autopsy.

00:13:24,226 --> 00:13:26,095
All we're
allowed to do

00:13:26,161 --> 00:13:28,063
is search for evidence
on the body.

00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:29,198
And then what?

00:13:29,264 --> 00:13:30,366
Then we take
it to Vegas.

00:13:30,432 --> 00:13:32,568
Tonight. We'll need someone

00:13:32,634 --> 00:13:34,269
to drive the body.

00:13:34,336 --> 00:13:36,138
Barry, it's your lucky day.
Get your car.

00:13:36,205 --> 00:13:37,139
Come on.

00:13:37,206 --> 00:13:38,307
Our medical examiner

00:13:38,374 --> 00:13:39,641
will send you
his report.

00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:40,809
You'll need to sign

00:13:40,876 --> 00:13:41,944
the death certificate

00:13:42,011 --> 00:13:44,680
as to cause and manner of death.

00:13:55,457 --> 00:13:58,093
No wallet and no ID.

00:14:05,034 --> 00:14:07,069
What have you got there?

00:14:07,136 --> 00:14:09,705
Well, I'm not sure yet.

00:14:22,251 --> 00:14:24,219
No ligature marks.

00:14:24,286 --> 00:14:25,287
Well, he wasn't tied up?

00:14:25,354 --> 00:14:26,388
Apparently not.

00:14:26,455 --> 00:14:27,790
Well, no one just

00:14:27,856 --> 00:14:29,858
lets themselves
get buried alive.

00:14:29,925 --> 00:14:31,827
Well, maybe the killer
had a gun on him.

00:14:31,894 --> 00:14:33,929
Well, you can't dig a hole
and hold a gun

00:14:33,996 --> 00:14:36,131
on an unbound victim
all at the same time.

00:14:36,198 --> 00:14:38,367
Well, maybe the hole was dug
earlier?

00:14:38,434 --> 00:14:40,769
That would imply premeditation.

00:14:40,836 --> 00:14:42,738
Or more than one killer.

00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,608
Maybe the victim was drugged.

00:14:46,675 --> 00:14:50,045
Sylvia Rogers's
dog got sick after

00:14:50,112 --> 00:14:51,980
chewing on the victim's head,
correct?

00:14:52,047 --> 00:14:53,549
That's right.

00:14:53,615 --> 00:14:55,384
Did you do blood work?

00:14:55,451 --> 00:14:56,852
I sent it off
to a lab in Reno.

00:14:56,919 --> 00:14:58,354
Still waiting for the results.

00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,588
Call the lab.

00:14:59,655 --> 00:15:03,058
Have them do a full drug
and tox panel on the blood.

00:15:06,528 --> 00:15:09,732
Maybe whatever was
in this man's body

00:15:09,798 --> 00:15:11,800
is also in the dog's.

00:15:18,307 --> 00:15:20,609
Hold on a second, fellows.

00:15:40,295 --> 00:15:42,297
Okay.

00:15:43,365 --> 00:15:44,266
Say cheese.

00:15:45,834 --> 00:15:47,269
Oh, what the hell
was that for?

00:15:47,336 --> 00:15:49,438
Souvenir.

00:15:49,505 --> 00:15:50,939
Why, is that French
for evidence?

00:15:51,006 --> 00:15:51,974
Straight drive, Barry.

00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:53,142
Stay out of the casinos.

00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:55,277
You got it, boss.

00:15:55,344 --> 00:15:57,346
You boys have a good night.

00:15:57,413 --> 00:15:58,614
( <i>engine starting</i> )

00:16:02,651 --> 00:16:04,720
Man.

00:16:04,787 --> 00:16:07,656
It was one hell of day.

00:16:09,358 --> 00:16:11,827
You need a place to sleep?

00:16:11,894 --> 00:16:14,663
I need a place to work.

00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,028
( <i>door opening</i> )

00:17:09,668 --> 00:17:11,837
Did I miss a memo or something?

00:17:11,904 --> 00:17:13,005
Oh, no.

00:17:13,072 --> 00:17:14,206
Grissom's on a safari.

00:17:14,273 --> 00:17:17,343
He's got you pushing
his paperwork, huh?

00:17:17,409 --> 00:17:19,578
Oh, no. I'm trying
to avoid that.

00:17:19,645 --> 00:17:23,449
His headless D.B. had
a Western LVU bookstore receipt

00:17:23,515 --> 00:17:24,616
in his pocket.

00:17:24,683 --> 00:17:25,784
Grissom just unraveled it.

00:17:25,851 --> 00:17:26,785
Really?

00:17:26,852 --> 00:17:28,020
Wow!

00:17:28,087 --> 00:17:30,556
Some of these books
are 100 bucks a pop.

00:17:30,622 --> 00:17:32,191
Tuition,
plus room and board--

00:17:32,257 --> 00:17:33,459
that's at least another 10K.

00:17:33,525 --> 00:17:34,460
You got to have money

00:17:34,526 --> 00:17:36,462
to go to college these days.

00:17:36,528 --> 00:17:39,698
Yeah, well, I missed that boat.

00:17:39,765 --> 00:17:42,901
So, most of these
are freshman textbooks.

00:17:42,968 --> 00:17:44,737
Core curriculum.

00:17:44,803 --> 00:17:48,407
Well, that's at least
2,000 students.

00:17:48,474 --> 00:17:51,143
Maybe you'll get lucky
with the victim's prints.

00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,678
Oh, wait. Hang on.

00:17:52,745 --> 00:17:55,748
<i>Chiaroscuro Theory</i>
<i>and Technique.</i>

00:17:55,814 --> 00:17:57,649
It's a sophomore-level
Fine Arts text.

00:17:57,716 --> 00:18:00,786
Freshman in a sophomore course?

00:18:00,853 --> 00:18:02,955
Narrows the field.

00:18:04,723 --> 00:18:06,825
BRASS:
<i>Actually, we're here</i>
<i>about your roommate,</i>

00:18:06,892 --> 00:18:08,060
Ross Jenson.

00:18:08,127 --> 00:18:10,062
Do you know where
we can find him?

00:18:10,129 --> 00:18:12,431
Uh, I actually haven't even
seen him since last Friday.

00:18:12,498 --> 00:18:14,600
I had Wheezer tickets,
and we were supposed to go,

00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:15,801
but he, uh, he blew me off.

00:18:15,868 --> 00:18:17,436
Gone almost a week.
That normal?

00:18:17,503 --> 00:18:19,238
Yeah, he's an art student,
you know.

00:18:19,304 --> 00:18:21,774
He goes off a lot,
and for days sometimes.

00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,175
Uh-huh.

00:18:23,242 --> 00:18:25,844
I've been, uh, studying my ass
off for this American History

00:18:25,911 --> 00:18:28,247
midterm, but, uh,

00:18:28,313 --> 00:18:30,315
feel free to have
a look around.

00:18:39,792 --> 00:18:42,094
That's not mine.

00:18:42,161 --> 00:18:43,362
I don't know what that is.

00:18:43,429 --> 00:18:44,630
Relax, buddy.

00:18:44,697 --> 00:18:46,432
This is a homicide

00:18:46,498 --> 00:18:48,133
investigation.

00:18:55,174 --> 00:18:57,309
Are these Ross's shoes?

00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:04,049
What do you got?

00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,588
Aspen leaf.

00:19:09,655 --> 00:19:11,390
A little piece
of the countryside.

00:19:11,457 --> 00:19:13,459
Has Ross spent

00:19:13,525 --> 00:19:15,394
a lot of time up
in northern Nevada?

00:19:15,461 --> 00:19:17,663
Yeah, he liked the scenery
up there.

00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:19,732
We're going to need
to take that computer

00:19:19,798 --> 00:19:21,567
and a few things
back to the lab.

00:19:21,633 --> 00:19:23,168
Okay.

00:19:26,071 --> 00:19:28,073
( <i>whirring</i> )

00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:46,859
WOMAN:
<i>Yeah.</i>

00:19:46,925 --> 00:19:48,494
Came in here last week.
Handsome boy.

00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,596
Nice clothes.

00:19:50,662 --> 00:19:52,531
Just passing through.

00:19:52,598 --> 00:19:53,966
There's, uh, fried chicken,

00:19:54,033 --> 00:19:55,834
me...

00:19:55,901 --> 00:19:58,370
Coffee's about all
I can handle right now.

00:19:58,437 --> 00:20:00,339
Maybe some other time, okay?

00:20:00,406 --> 00:20:02,675
WOMAN:
Guess you weren't his type.

00:20:02,741 --> 00:20:04,276
MAN:
Wasn't he the guy

00:20:04,343 --> 00:20:05,844
driving that gutless
little four-banger?

00:20:05,911 --> 00:20:06,945
What kind of car was it?

00:20:07,012 --> 00:20:08,013
I don't know.
Kid's car.

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,382
Something to drive
around the city.

00:20:10,449 --> 00:20:12,184
It's no good
for hills.

00:20:12,251 --> 00:20:14,319
Black, or, what,
blue, maybe.

00:20:14,386 --> 00:20:15,821
Lieutenant?

00:20:15,888 --> 00:20:17,056
Yeah.

00:20:17,122 --> 00:20:18,691
The victim was on his way
out of town.

00:20:18,757 --> 00:20:20,059
We know he didn't get very far.

00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:21,560
So where's
his vehicle?

00:20:21,627 --> 00:20:23,195
Anybody here

00:20:23,262 --> 00:20:25,397
seen a black or blue
mystery vehicle?

00:20:25,464 --> 00:20:27,032
No. Uh-uh.

00:20:27,099 --> 00:20:28,300
No.

00:20:28,367 --> 00:20:30,235
Well, I'd say that car's

00:20:30,302 --> 00:20:31,403
long gone by now.

00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:32,971
If the killer
was a local,

00:20:33,038 --> 00:20:35,607
he could have ditched the car
somewhere near here.

00:20:38,043 --> 00:20:40,145
Do you have a local suspect?

00:20:40,212 --> 00:20:41,280
It's a theory.

00:20:41,347 --> 00:20:42,281
Oh.

00:20:42,348 --> 00:20:43,749
And like any theory,

00:20:43,816 --> 00:20:45,584
it doesn't mean anything
unless you can prove it.

00:20:45,651 --> 00:20:46,719
Yeah.

00:20:46,785 --> 00:20:47,786
May I borrow this?

00:20:49,121 --> 00:20:50,556
The victim was last
seen here, right?

00:20:50,622 --> 00:20:51,824
Yeah.
We found his body

00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:53,692
here.
Mm-hmm.

00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:55,160
This is the only way
out of town.

00:20:55,227 --> 00:20:56,495
The killer had
to intercept him

00:20:56,562 --> 00:20:58,864
somewhere along this road.

00:20:58,931 --> 00:21:00,799
Knock yourself out.

00:21:39,805 --> 00:21:42,441

( <i>sighs</i> )

00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:41,804
Hey, Doc, I need to use
some of your medical supplies

00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:43,038
and make a telephone call.

00:23:43,105 --> 00:23:44,373
It's local.

00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,808
Uh... okay.

00:23:59,357 --> 00:24:00,558
Did you tint these windows yourself?

00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:02,527
M...aybe not the best job
in the world,

00:24:02,593 --> 00:24:03,694
but it does the trick.

00:24:04,457 --> 00:24:06,159
Do you have
any tinting film left?

00:24:06,226 --> 00:24:07,360
Think so.

00:24:07,427 --> 00:24:08,728
May I use it?

00:24:08,795 --> 00:24:10,463
Okay. I'll have to go check.

00:24:13,433 --> 00:24:15,401
Oh, good, the police.

00:24:15,468 --> 00:24:16,536
I'd like to report a crime.

00:24:16,603 --> 00:24:17,537
No kidding?

00:24:17,604 --> 00:24:18,705
Yeah, my vehicle
was broken into

00:24:18,771 --> 00:24:20,039
and my field kit
was stolen.

00:24:20,106 --> 00:24:21,541
That's going to
cramp your style.

00:24:21,608 --> 00:24:24,210
Not necessarily.

00:24:25,512 --> 00:24:27,280
( <i>bell dings, door creaks</i> )

00:24:27,347 --> 00:24:29,949
Would you keep an
eye on this for me?

00:24:30,016 --> 00:24:31,117
Sure.

00:24:31,184 --> 00:24:32,719
Thanks.

00:24:32,786 --> 00:24:34,254
Excuse me.

00:24:52,872 --> 00:24:54,174
( <i>bell dings</i> )

00:24:58,878 --> 00:25:00,713
Listen, why don't you

00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:01,981
come on by
and fill out a report

00:25:02,048 --> 00:25:03,750
about that kit.

00:25:03,817 --> 00:25:04,851
You think that would help?

00:25:04,918 --> 00:25:06,085
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:25:06,152 --> 00:25:08,788
It wouldn't hurt.

00:25:08,855 --> 00:25:10,924
I, uh, found the victim's car.

00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:12,559
Well, I am impressed.

00:25:12,625 --> 00:25:14,060
Wh... Where was it?

00:25:14,127 --> 00:25:16,996
It was, uh, ditched
in an old barn up in the hills.

00:25:17,063 --> 00:25:18,198
Uh-huh.

00:25:18,264 --> 00:25:19,833
I know you don't have
any men to spare,

00:25:19,899 --> 00:25:21,134
so I called the
Highway Patrol.

00:25:21,201 --> 00:25:23,303
They're sending troopers
up there to secure the site.

00:25:23,369 --> 00:25:25,772
Oh, well,
nearest station's in Elko.

00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:28,741
Should take 'em a couple hours
to get here.

00:25:28,808 --> 00:25:31,177
Well, that should, uh,
give you enough time

00:25:31,244 --> 00:25:32,545
to burn down the barn.

00:27:06,906 --> 00:27:08,608
You going to just
stand there,

00:27:08,675 --> 00:27:10,510
or are you coming in?

00:27:10,577 --> 00:27:12,345
Oh, I don't want
to disturb the scene.

00:27:12,412 --> 00:27:14,681
You carry on.

00:27:14,747 --> 00:27:16,349
Shame to see so much work

00:27:16,416 --> 00:27:18,585
go to waste.

00:27:22,922 --> 00:27:25,024
What does that
mean exactly?

00:27:25,091 --> 00:27:26,860
Well, unless
you've managed

00:27:26,926 --> 00:27:28,962
to improvise yourself
a warrant as well,

00:27:29,028 --> 00:27:30,396
this is an illegal search.

00:27:30,463 --> 00:27:34,801
This barn had been broken into,
which makes it a crime scene,

00:27:34,868 --> 00:27:37,137
even without the murder
victim's car inside,

00:27:37,203 --> 00:27:40,473
so I don't need a warrant.

00:27:41,508 --> 00:27:42,876
Who owns this place?

00:27:42,942 --> 00:27:44,144
Nobody.

00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:45,779
Owner died
a few years ago.

00:27:45,845 --> 00:27:49,449
Well, then who's responsible
for the property?

00:27:49,516 --> 00:27:51,384
His nephew.

00:27:51,451 --> 00:27:53,720
Marty Cooperman.

00:27:53,787 --> 00:27:55,822
Runs the gas station.

00:27:55,889 --> 00:27:58,291
Is that who you're protecting?

00:28:21,915 --> 00:28:24,050
Hey, you think you
can fix this window?

00:28:28,421 --> 00:28:30,657
Yeah, I think I can fix that.

00:28:30,723 --> 00:28:32,725
You know that kid
that got murdered?

00:28:32,792 --> 00:28:35,328
We found his car
up in the hills.

00:28:35,395 --> 00:28:37,931
In your uncle's old barn.

00:28:38,965 --> 00:28:41,668
Oh, I haven't been up there
for years.

00:28:41,734 --> 00:28:44,170
That's understandable.
It's hard to get to.

00:28:44,237 --> 00:28:46,539
Not too many gas
stations around here.

00:28:46,606 --> 00:28:49,375
You must do pretty
good business.

00:28:49,442 --> 00:28:51,711
Yeah, I got the only pumps
for 23 miles.

00:28:51,778 --> 00:28:53,546
I do pretty good.

00:28:55,582 --> 00:28:58,218
You know, uh,
the victim's car
was full of gas.

00:28:59,252 --> 00:29:00,954
So you must've
seen him, right,

00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,822
even though you
said you didn't?

00:29:02,889 --> 00:29:06,693
I can have your window fixed
in a couple hours, Mr. Grissom,

00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:09,229
and then you can
get back home.

00:29:09,295 --> 00:29:12,432
I think you should do that.

00:29:16,803 --> 00:29:18,738
( <i>phone rings</i> )

00:29:20,573 --> 00:29:22,175
Grissom.

00:29:22,242 --> 00:29:23,610
Everybody in Sleepy Hollow

00:29:23,676 --> 00:29:25,578
still drawing a blank
on the victim?

00:29:25,645 --> 00:29:26,846
More or less.

00:29:26,913 --> 00:29:28,381
Well, then somebody's lying.

00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,983
Ross Jenson was having
a relationship

00:29:30,049 --> 00:29:31,050
with someone in Jackpot.

00:29:31,117 --> 00:29:32,719
Greg traced a series
of romantic IMs

00:29:32,786 --> 00:29:34,187
from your victim's computer.

00:29:34,254 --> 00:29:35,555
Greg did?

00:29:35,622 --> 00:29:36,923
Yeah, he knows stuff.

00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:38,091
Pretty hot stuff, too.

00:29:38,158 --> 00:29:39,526
Sounds like he was in love.

00:29:39,592 --> 00:29:41,861
Brass is still working
on a court order for the name.

00:29:41,928 --> 00:29:43,396
You ever coming back?

00:29:45,231 --> 00:29:46,432
Hopefully.

00:29:46,499 --> 00:29:47,867
Ms. Willows,
this came for you,

00:29:47,934 --> 00:29:49,202
certified mail.

00:29:49,269 --> 00:29:52,138
Oh. Thanks, Judy.

00:30:19,432 --> 00:30:20,500
( <i>footsteps approaching</i> )

00:30:20,567 --> 00:30:22,235
STERLING:
Just got the
blood test results

00:30:22,302 --> 00:30:24,237
back from Sylvia's dog.

00:30:24,304 --> 00:30:27,540
There were traces of GHB
in his system.

00:30:27,607 --> 00:30:31,411
I thought GHB
was a party drug.

00:30:31,478 --> 00:30:33,246
It is.

00:30:33,313 --> 00:30:35,081
It's also a powerful sedative.

00:30:35,148 --> 00:30:37,283
Could be what was
used to subdue him.

00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:39,953
You know anybody in town
that would use this?

00:30:40,019 --> 00:30:41,855
( <i>chuckles</i> ):
Uh, weed and speed

00:30:41,921 --> 00:30:43,990
are the drugs of choice
around here.

00:30:44,057 --> 00:30:46,126
Hey, Doc, take a look
at the scope, will you?

00:30:48,161 --> 00:30:52,665
I found some hairs
in Ross Jenson's shirts.

00:30:52,732 --> 00:30:55,235
That is cat hair.

00:30:55,301 --> 00:30:57,370
Tricolored.

00:30:57,437 --> 00:30:58,805
Probably...

00:30:58,872 --> 00:31:00,473
Abyssinian.

00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:04,778
You wouldn't happen to have
any Abyssinian patients?

00:31:04,844 --> 00:31:07,280
One.

00:31:08,281 --> 00:31:10,550
Uh... Ah.

00:31:10,617 --> 00:31:12,552
Here she is.

00:31:12,619 --> 00:31:14,120
Isis.

00:31:14,187 --> 00:31:17,724
Her owner has allergies.

00:31:17,791 --> 00:31:20,093
He needed an aggressive,

00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,928
shorthair

00:31:21,995 --> 00:31:23,163
mouser.

00:31:29,068 --> 00:31:31,137
Excuse me, Lieutenant.

00:31:31,204 --> 00:31:33,239
We need to talk.

00:31:33,306 --> 00:31:34,808
So talk.

00:31:34,874 --> 00:31:36,843
Privately, please.

00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:38,978
Just call them.

00:31:41,314 --> 00:31:42,782
What?

00:31:42,849 --> 00:31:45,151
Ross Jenson was having
a romantic relationship

00:31:45,218 --> 00:31:46,553
with someone in this town.

00:31:46,619 --> 00:31:48,188
And you can you prove that?

00:31:48,254 --> 00:31:49,589
Yes.

00:31:49,656 --> 00:31:51,991
I believe he was up here
visiting that person.

00:31:52,058 --> 00:31:54,494
I found cat hairs
on his T-shirts.

00:31:54,561 --> 00:31:56,863
From an Abyssinian cat.

00:31:56,930 --> 00:31:58,731
The kind your brother owns.

00:31:58,798 --> 00:32:02,001
Just what the hell
are you saying?

00:32:02,068 --> 00:32:04,471
Does your brother live alone?

00:32:04,537 --> 00:32:05,672
Yes.

00:32:06,706 --> 00:32:08,741
Is he gay?

00:32:08,808 --> 00:32:09,809
That is nobody's business.

00:32:09,876 --> 00:32:10,810
I realize that,

00:32:10,877 --> 00:32:12,812
but it's relevant
to this investigation.

00:32:12,879 --> 00:32:14,214
No, he was married.
He has a kid.

00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,315
Was married?

00:32:15,381 --> 00:32:16,916
She left him flat,
ten years ago. So, what?

00:32:16,983 --> 00:32:20,353
Look, whether you like it
or not, Leland is a suspect.

00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:22,689
But you already
knew that.

00:32:22,755 --> 00:32:24,724
I'm giving you
an opportunity, Lieutenant.

00:32:24,791 --> 00:32:27,293
So far, you're only guilty
of being a good brother.

00:32:28,328 --> 00:32:30,296
Get in.

00:32:38,471 --> 00:32:39,906
What are you worried about?

00:32:39,973 --> 00:32:42,342
You do have a gun, don't you?

00:32:42,408 --> 00:32:44,144
( <i>engine starting</i> )

00:33:05,532 --> 00:33:09,469
Look, um, just give me
a minute with him.

00:33:14,607 --> 00:33:16,376
Hey, Bubba.

00:33:16,443 --> 00:33:18,044
Leland.

00:33:18,111 --> 00:33:19,412
We need to ask
you a few...

00:33:19,479 --> 00:33:20,547
What's he doing here?

00:33:20,613 --> 00:33:22,749
Never mind him.

00:33:22,816 --> 00:33:24,951
You and I need
to have a talk.

00:33:29,055 --> 00:33:31,024
( <i>door closes</i> )

( <i>cat meows</i> )

00:33:58,485 --> 00:34:00,620
Put that down!
I don't know what
you're talking about.

00:34:00,687 --> 00:34:02,355
Put that down!
I don't know what
you're talking about!

00:34:02,422 --> 00:34:04,023
( <i>gunshot</i> )

00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:05,625
Let me do this!
Don't you...!

00:34:05,692 --> 00:34:07,026
Leland!
Let me do this!

00:34:07,093 --> 00:34:09,295
Leland!
Let me do this!

00:34:13,833 --> 00:34:17,337
( <i>sobbing</i> )

00:34:24,127 --> 00:34:25,795
You're going to keep Leland
in there, right?

00:34:26,583 --> 00:34:30,787
Yeah, until
he's ready to go home.

00:34:30,854 --> 00:34:33,690
He took at shot at me,
and he tried to kill himself.

00:34:33,757 --> 00:34:35,392
That's not the way I saw it.

00:34:35,458 --> 00:34:37,060
FYI,

00:34:37,127 --> 00:34:38,895
Leland's always run pretty hot.

00:34:38,962 --> 00:34:40,030
That's no secret.

00:34:42,766 --> 00:34:45,635
Matter of fact,
back in high school

00:34:45,702 --> 00:34:48,004
he and Marty Cooperman
played football together.

00:34:48,071 --> 00:34:50,573
One Friday night,
after a couple of beers,

00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:53,476
Marty started
busting on Leland.

00:34:53,543 --> 00:34:56,513
And Leland just busts him back.

00:34:56,579 --> 00:34:59,349
And I helped.

00:35:00,784 --> 00:35:03,320
And we fractured Marty's leg
in three places.

00:35:03,386 --> 00:35:06,856
So I should be grateful that
you showed restraint with me.

00:35:06,923 --> 00:35:08,858
No, I didn't do it for you.

00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:14,164
A man shouldn't go through life
ashamed of who he is.

00:35:32,282 --> 00:35:33,617
What is this?

00:35:33,683 --> 00:35:35,552
A way to get you to talk to me.

00:35:35,619 --> 00:35:36,753
Well, I didn't come here
to talk.

00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:37,754
I came to give it back.

00:35:37,821 --> 00:35:39,122
Not enough?

00:35:42,659 --> 00:35:45,295
You're a murderer.

00:35:45,362 --> 00:35:47,397
Not in the eyes of the law.

00:35:48,298 --> 00:35:49,899
You look good, Mugs.

00:35:49,966 --> 00:35:52,035
How's Lindsey?

00:35:52,102 --> 00:35:53,570
She likes horses, right?

00:35:53,637 --> 00:35:55,205
Lindsey's none
of your business.

00:35:55,271 --> 00:35:56,373
You keep her out of this.

00:35:56,439 --> 00:35:58,708
I'm her grandfather.

00:35:58,775 --> 00:36:02,145
Yeah, well,
nothing I can do about that.

00:36:02,212 --> 00:36:04,547
Catherine, it's just a gift.

00:36:04,614 --> 00:36:05,715
You need the money.

00:36:05,782 --> 00:36:08,184
And the next time you stab
one of your showgirls

00:36:08,251 --> 00:36:10,320
and you need CSI to cover it,
I'm supposed to help you out,

00:36:10,387 --> 00:36:12,822
right?
Take a good look at me.

00:36:12,889 --> 00:36:15,492
Plenty of fresh air,
sun on my face.

00:36:17,193 --> 00:36:18,895
You think I need your help?

00:36:20,964 --> 00:36:22,265
I don't need your charity.

00:36:22,332 --> 00:36:23,967
You know what
your problem is?

00:36:24,034 --> 00:36:27,337
You enjoy making life hard.

00:36:27,404 --> 00:36:30,240
You're lucky Lindsey's
too young to understand that.

00:36:30,307 --> 00:36:33,343
Cash it,
or tear it up.

00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:34,811
Do whatever you want.

00:36:34,878 --> 00:36:37,047
I have one son in jail...

00:36:37,113 --> 00:36:40,183
another in the ground.

00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:42,686
I never did right
by your mother.

00:36:42,752 --> 00:36:44,754
But I'm damn sure going
to try to do right by you.

00:37:09,879 --> 00:37:12,148
Hey, Catherine...

00:37:12,215 --> 00:37:13,216
Hey.

00:37:13,283 --> 00:37:14,818
What's up?

00:37:14,884 --> 00:37:17,087
A possible inconsistency.

00:37:19,122 --> 00:37:20,957
Hey...

00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:22,626
you have a phone call.

00:37:22,692 --> 00:37:25,228
Line two.
I think it's your wife.

00:37:25,295 --> 00:37:27,731
Thanks.

00:37:29,733 --> 00:37:30,834
Hello, dear.

00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,902
The day Ross Jenson left Vegas,

00:37:32,969 --> 00:37:34,704
he used MapQuest
to get directions

00:37:34,771 --> 00:37:37,307
from his dorm to Jackpot.

00:37:37,374 --> 00:37:38,642
Well, that makes sense.

00:37:38,708 --> 00:37:40,343
From what I've been able
to gather, this was

00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:41,911
his first and only visit
up here.

00:37:41,978 --> 00:37:43,546
Well, that doesn't make sense.

00:37:43,613 --> 00:37:45,782
He was involved with someone
in Jackpot for several months.

00:37:45,849 --> 00:37:47,817
There were traces
of aspen leaves

00:37:47,884 --> 00:37:49,519
in his dorm room closet.

00:37:49,586 --> 00:37:51,054
I just assumed
he'd been there before.

00:37:51,121 --> 00:37:54,658
Well, if I believe this was
his first and only visit,

00:37:54,724 --> 00:37:57,093
how do we explain the leaves
in his closet?

00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,062
He has a roommate.

00:37:59,129 --> 00:38:00,897
Does the roommate have a name?

00:38:00,964 --> 00:38:04,167
Yeah, his name is...

00:38:04,234 --> 00:38:05,502
Eric Brooks.

00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:07,070
Eric Brooks?

00:38:07,137 --> 00:38:09,506
Oh, yeah,
that's Leland's boy.

00:38:09,572 --> 00:38:11,574
You guys going to tell him
about his dad?

00:38:13,743 --> 00:38:15,512
BRASS:
Did you know your
father was having

00:38:15,578 --> 00:38:16,947
a sexual relationship
with Ross Jenson?

00:38:17,013 --> 00:38:18,715
My dad's not gay.

00:38:18,782 --> 00:38:20,183
Was Ross?

00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:22,619
We never talked
about it.

00:38:22,686 --> 00:38:24,454
BRASS:
Were you in Jackpot,
Nevada last weekend?

00:38:24,521 --> 00:38:26,056
No.

00:38:26,122 --> 00:38:27,590
Ross Jenson was...

00:38:27,657 --> 00:38:28,758
visiting your dad.

00:38:28,825 --> 00:38:30,393
We found his car

00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:32,495
ditched in a barn
outside town.

00:38:32,562 --> 00:38:34,331
We got your fingerprints

00:38:34,397 --> 00:38:37,200
from a former
ROTC commander of yours,

00:38:37,267 --> 00:38:39,202
and...

00:38:39,269 --> 00:38:40,837
they matched a print
that we recovered

00:38:40,904 --> 00:38:41,972
from the steering wheel.

00:38:42,038 --> 00:38:44,240
He let me borrow his car
all the time.

00:38:44,307 --> 00:38:45,608
We were roommates.

00:38:45,675 --> 00:38:47,444
BRASS:
That's right.
You don't own a car.

00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:49,346
You ride a motorcycle.

00:38:51,781 --> 00:38:53,550
Yeah.

00:38:53,617 --> 00:38:54,818
So?

00:38:54,884 --> 00:38:57,120
Could I see the bottom
of your shoes, please?

00:39:07,297 --> 00:39:09,132
Well, that's an
unusual wear pattern.

00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:12,168
Matches the shoe print
we recovered

00:39:12,235 --> 00:39:13,870
from the barn
near the vehicle.

00:39:13,937 --> 00:39:16,306
Put a lot of miles on your bike.
It shows.

00:39:18,041 --> 00:39:20,677
You were there.

00:39:32,155 --> 00:39:35,091
GRISSOM:
<i>Eric must've known for a while.</i>

00:39:35,158 --> 00:39:36,326
How did you intend

00:39:36,393 --> 00:39:38,094
to keep the relationship
from your own son?

00:39:38,161 --> 00:39:41,097
I've been hiding it
my whole life.

00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,302
You knew.

00:39:45,368 --> 00:39:48,672
Yeah...

00:39:48,738 --> 00:39:50,707
I figured you'd tell me
when you were ready.

00:39:50,774 --> 00:39:53,810
I saw you
with Ross.

00:39:53,877 --> 00:39:55,912
I stopped by here
last weekend.

00:39:59,349 --> 00:40:01,051
You and he were taking a walk.

00:40:05,188 --> 00:40:08,725
I'm sorry.
You got nothing
to be sorry about.

00:40:08,792 --> 00:40:10,794
Nothing.

00:40:12,362 --> 00:40:13,530
Lee, it turns out

00:40:13,596 --> 00:40:15,799
Eric...

00:40:15,865 --> 00:40:18,001
Mr. Brooks, your son
killed Ross Jenson.

00:40:18,068 --> 00:40:20,470
That is not possible.

00:40:20,537 --> 00:40:24,074
According to the evidence,
it is.

00:40:25,166 --> 00:40:31,047
WILLOWS:
<i>We tested the thermos</i>
<i>and found traces of GHB.</i>

00:40:31,114 --> 00:40:35,185
You used Ross' drugs
to subdue him.

00:40:35,251 --> 00:40:38,521
BRASS:
It's a long drive
from Jackpot to Vegas.

00:40:38,588 --> 00:40:41,224
You knew he'd stop for a refill
before he left town.

00:40:45,629 --> 00:40:47,731
( <i>horn honking</i> )

00:40:54,437 --> 00:40:55,905
Eric never could deal
with the fact

00:40:55,972 --> 00:40:59,609
that his mother left.

00:40:59,676 --> 00:41:02,412
She just wanted a husband.

00:41:02,479 --> 00:41:04,381
All I wanted was a family.

00:41:08,385 --> 00:41:09,886
ERIC:
<i>People in town...</i>

00:41:09,953 --> 00:41:12,422
they said my dad
was "different."

00:41:12,489 --> 00:41:14,524
But he wasn't.
He was just lonely.

00:41:14,591 --> 00:41:18,194
And Ross, like, totally
used that to ruin him.

00:41:19,462 --> 00:41:21,031
It was all Ross.

00:41:21,097 --> 00:41:22,766
That why you drugged him?

00:41:22,832 --> 00:41:25,235
Drove him
into the woods?

00:41:25,302 --> 00:41:26,603
Put him in a hole...

00:41:32,042 --> 00:41:34,444
buried him up to his neck...

00:41:37,147 --> 00:41:38,882
cut him...

00:41:40,617 --> 00:41:41,618
ROSS:
What are you doing?

00:41:41,685 --> 00:41:43,086
( <i>screams</i> )

00:41:43,153 --> 00:41:45,822
Why didn't you go the distance?

00:41:45,889 --> 00:41:47,657
Why didn't you

00:41:47,724 --> 00:41:50,226
finish him off
yourself?
Because I wanted him to suffer.

00:41:51,995 --> 00:41:54,464
Because he was in love
with your father?

00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,135
Or because
he wasn't in love with you?

00:42:06,042 --> 00:42:08,078
I don't suppose
that comes with a warranty?

00:42:08,144 --> 00:42:10,647
Nothing around here does,
Mr. Grissom.

00:42:10,714 --> 00:42:12,382
Thanks for the business.

00:42:12,449 --> 00:42:13,583
Hey, Marty.

00:42:15,652 --> 00:42:17,087
Does he ever
talk to you?

00:42:17,153 --> 00:42:19,889
Not one word
since high school.

00:42:21,825 --> 00:42:24,961
Listen, when we found
that torso in the hole,

00:42:25,028 --> 00:42:26,863
on the crest
of that hill...

00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:28,865
I recognized the kid's shirt,

00:42:28,932 --> 00:42:30,834
and I knew he'd been
with Leland, so...

00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:33,603
So you assumed your brother
was capable of murder.

00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:36,473
Didn't even ask him
what happened.

00:42:36,539 --> 00:42:39,843
Questions, remember?

00:42:39,909 --> 00:42:41,878
Not asking them
is what got everybody

00:42:41,945 --> 00:42:43,380
in trouble here
in the first place.

00:42:43,446 --> 00:42:46,883
You don't keep any secrets,
Mr. Grissom?

00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:48,718
Not even from your wife?

00:42:52,789 --> 00:42:55,692
I used to.
I'm trying to change.

00:42:57,394 --> 00:42:58,361
It's a bitch.

00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:02,532
Have a good trip.
