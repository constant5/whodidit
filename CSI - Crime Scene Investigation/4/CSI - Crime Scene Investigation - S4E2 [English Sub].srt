The affidavit is standing.

You've signed warrants for less.

Love is not love.

00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:27,850
Love is conditional.

00:03:24,597 --> 00:03:25,932
Unable to locate.

00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:27,300
False alarm.
We came right back.

00:03:27,366 --> 00:03:28,734
Observed no activity
in the house

00:03:28,801 --> 00:03:30,570

00:03:30,636 --> 00:03:32,271
You know we're going to
need to see your guns.

00:03:32,338 --> 00:03:33,973
Why would we off
two scumbags

when we know you're coming back
with a warrant?

00:03:36,042 --> 00:03:37,310

00:03:37,376 --> 00:03:38,811
And you're not my supervisor.

00:03:40,279 --> 00:03:41,614

And your backups, too.

00:04:01,567 --> 00:04:02,468
Come on.

00:04:14,914 --> 00:04:16,115
Satisfied?

00:04:16,182 --> 00:04:17,817
Just doing my job.

00:04:17,884 --> 00:04:19,719
Here you go. Fellas,
check out the back.

00:04:19,785 --> 00:04:21,454
Okay? Let's go.

00:04:38,538 --> 00:04:41,040
These our serials?

00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:43,676
So it seems.

00:04:45,311 --> 00:04:48,247
Yesterday's suspects.
Today's victims.

00:04:48,314 --> 00:04:49,982
We had 'em...

00:04:55,822 --> 00:04:57,490
Take the inside.

00:05:05,164 --> 00:05:06,999
No sign of forced entry...

00:05:07,066 --> 00:05:09,802
on this door, at least.

00:05:15,942 --> 00:05:17,977
Print the handle.

00:05:39,465 --> 00:05:41,100
What do you think?

00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:48,741
I don't know what that is.

00:05:48,808 --> 00:05:50,877
Make sure you get all of it,
though.

00:05:51,911 --> 00:05:54,347
You see any
cartridge casings?

00:05:54,413 --> 00:05:55,882
Not yet.

00:06:12,932 --> 00:06:15,034
85.5.

00:06:17,503 --> 00:06:19,071
So TOD

00:06:19,138 --> 00:06:21,440
was about 11:00 p.m.

00:06:32,285 --> 00:06:33,719
Grissom,

00:06:33,786 --> 00:06:34,787
I've got blood, but...

00:06:36,155 --> 00:06:38,758
a lot of pheno-negative stains
as well.

00:06:38,825 --> 00:06:40,226
We're going to bring
everything back.

00:07:10,356 --> 00:07:12,825
What do you got,
Warrick?

00:07:14,026 --> 00:07:15,928
If the killer went out
the back door,

00:07:15,995 --> 00:07:18,097
this may be his print.

00:07:22,702 --> 00:07:24,504
Good thing Brass had cops
watching the house.

00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:25,938
Linens and towels
from the Sphere

00:07:26,005 --> 00:07:27,240
on top of the washing machine,

00:07:27,306 --> 00:07:29,075
and what I believe to
be sheets from the motel

00:07:29,142 --> 00:07:30,409
inside the dryer.

00:07:30,476 --> 00:07:31,878
Both positive presumptive
for blood.

00:07:31,944 --> 00:07:33,646
Think they were being smart
taking the sheets,

00:07:33,713 --> 00:07:35,381
or did they just get
off sleeping on 'em?

00:07:35,448 --> 00:07:37,517
Either way, they were sick
and dangerous.

00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:40,586
What does that say
about whoever killed them?

00:07:40,653 --> 00:07:42,889
Wh-What's the big deal?
There's no humans involved.

00:07:42,955 --> 00:07:44,824
I mean, look, Captain.

00:07:44,891 --> 00:07:47,059
Come on. The way I see it,
somebody did us a favor.

00:07:47,126 --> 00:07:49,262
Yeah.
They're dead.
Case is closed.

00:07:49,328 --> 00:07:50,897
Hey, this isn't a favor, Bill.

00:07:50,963 --> 00:07:52,031
This is a screwup.

00:07:52,098 --> 00:07:53,533
Would've been a lot bigger
screwup if...

00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,535
if we didn't break surveillance
and had an officer down

00:07:55,601 --> 00:07:57,403
four blocks away.

00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:59,372
All right, what else
did you see?

00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:00,873
Kid in that house made us.

00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:03,476
Thought we were bad news.

00:08:03,543 --> 00:08:05,411
You are bad news.

00:08:07,713 --> 00:08:11,851
I can't believe Grissom pulled
us off that serial murder case.

00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:14,854
Yeah, well, let me
tell you how it ends.

00:08:14,921 --> 00:08:16,689
They die.

00:08:16,756 --> 00:08:19,492
Whoa, this isn't half
bad for college kids.

00:08:19,559 --> 00:08:21,194
Yeah. Why live in
a one-room flea bag

00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,529
when you can pool
your resources
and live like this.

00:08:23,596 --> 00:08:26,866
Hey, how 'bout it: you, me,
Warrick, Nick, Grissom...

00:08:26,933 --> 00:08:29,268
Oh, can't. Not Grissom.

00:08:34,607 --> 00:08:37,376
What the hell
is this?

00:08:37,443 --> 00:08:39,512
Ma'am, you may want
to take one of these.

00:08:39,579 --> 00:08:41,547
Thank you. Thanks.

00:08:41,614 --> 00:08:42,715
Where's the body?

00:08:42,782 --> 00:08:43,883
Upstairs.

00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:45,852
Upstairs?

00:08:50,223 --> 00:08:53,392
It's raining man juice.

00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:55,027
Hallelujah.

00:08:55,094 --> 00:08:57,396
You might want to wear those.

00:08:57,463 --> 00:08:58,564
Thank you.

00:08:58,631 --> 00:09:00,666
Well, weather's clearing.

00:09:00,733 --> 00:09:02,668
Yeah, if only
the smell would.

Oh, my goodness.

00:09:25,191 --> 00:09:27,059
Oh, God.

00:09:28,995 --> 00:09:31,130
Soup's on.

00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,536
How long has he been in here?

00:09:36,602 --> 00:09:38,538
Roommates last saw him
Thursday night.

00:09:38,604 --> 00:09:40,273
Took off for the weekend.

00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:41,874
Came home to this.

00:09:41,941 --> 00:09:45,044
Guy goes to take a shower
and DFOs.

00:09:45,111 --> 00:09:46,979
He never got to the cold water,
did he?

00:09:47,046 --> 00:09:49,549
Roommate said only the hot water
faucet was on.

00:09:49,615 --> 00:09:51,217
Must've been a steam bath
in here.

00:09:51,284 --> 00:09:52,552
Still is.

00:09:52,618 --> 00:09:56,055
Well, any evidence
on the floor's been washed away.

00:09:56,122 --> 00:09:57,590
There, uh...

00:09:57,657 --> 00:09:59,759
( <i>clears throat</i> ):
could be something in the tub.

00:09:59,826 --> 00:10:02,295
We got to take that body
and get it through that door.

00:10:02,361 --> 00:10:04,797
SARA:
There's another option.

00:10:09,469 --> 00:10:11,337

I'm at the corner
of Harmon Hill and 25th,

00:10:11,404 --> 00:10:12,605
just east of the intersection.

00:10:12,672 --> 00:10:13,673
There's been a shooting.

00:10:13,739 --> 00:10:15,074
I think a cop got shot.

00:10:15,141 --> 00:10:16,576
John, oh...

00:10:16,642 --> 00:10:17,743
Just occurred.

00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:18,911
I heard the shots.

00:10:18,978 --> 00:10:19,912
I received the call

00:10:19,979 --> 00:10:21,581
and issued the 444.

00:10:21,647 --> 00:10:23,316
Uniforms called back
a few minutes later,

00:10:23,382 --> 00:10:25,418
said they checked the area,
said it was a UTL.

00:10:25,485 --> 00:10:26,919
You want to hear that?

00:10:26,986 --> 00:10:28,421
I'll hear it
when you give me a dub

00:10:28,488 --> 00:10:30,256
of the original caller's
voice...

00:10:30,323 --> 00:10:31,858
and his phone number.

00:10:31,924 --> 00:10:33,860
I can get that for you
right now.

00:10:33,926 --> 00:10:35,728
Good.

If I'm not done,
you're not done.

We already gave you
our footprints,

and our fingerprints
are on file,

00:11:06,459 --> 00:11:08,060
so what else
do you need?

00:11:08,127 --> 00:11:10,630

00:12:35,681 --> 00:12:36,916
Yeah...

00:12:36,983 --> 00:12:38,751
and I was watching
these guys all night.

00:12:38,818 --> 00:12:39,919
See, the two bad guys

00:12:39,986 --> 00:12:41,087
drove away in the van,

00:12:41,154 --> 00:12:42,655
and then the
policeman showed up,

00:12:42,722 --> 00:12:43,923
knocked on the door.

00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:45,224
Mr. Klinefeld let him in...

00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:46,425
but he never came back out.

00:12:46,492 --> 00:12:47,794
Did you see a police car?

00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,595
Must've walked here.

00:12:49,662 --> 00:12:51,464
Did you hear any gunshots?

00:12:51,531 --> 00:12:52,632
Nope.

00:12:52,698 --> 00:12:54,767
Okay, thanks, Bradley.
Good job.

00:12:54,834 --> 00:12:56,002
No problem.

00:13:00,439 --> 00:13:04,310
Ever see a beat cop
anywhere but the Strip?

00:13:05,344 --> 00:13:07,446
And how'd he beat us
to the killer?

00:13:14,457 --> 00:13:15,558
Trace evidence.

00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:18,428
Definitely doesn't belong
in the wound track.

00:13:18,495 --> 00:13:20,897
Did your guy get shot
through a window?

00:13:20,964 --> 00:13:22,298
No.

00:13:22,365 --> 00:13:25,969
We found a lot of this material
at the crime scene.

00:13:26,035 --> 00:13:27,403
Absence of gunshot residue.

00:13:28,438 --> 00:13:30,039
GRISSOM:
Maybe he was shot

00:13:30,106 --> 00:13:32,008
through some sort of object.

00:13:32,075 --> 00:13:34,544
Well, Mr. Klinefeld was shot
once in the front

00:13:34,611 --> 00:13:35,578
and Mrs. Klinefeld

00:13:35,645 --> 00:13:38,515
once in the back.

00:13:39,415 --> 00:13:40,583
( <i>yelling</i> )

00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:41,918
( <i>gunshot</i> )

00:13:41,985 --> 00:13:45,255
Dare I say the couple
that slays together,

00:13:45,321 --> 00:13:47,657
lays together?

00:14:30,633 --> 00:14:33,303
This drain hasn't
been tampered with.

00:14:33,369 --> 00:14:35,705
It's just clogged.

00:14:35,772 --> 00:14:36,873
I think this is an accidental.

00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,776
There's nothing
but young people stuff.

00:14:39,843 --> 00:14:41,544
No meds, except some aspirin.

00:14:41,611 --> 00:14:44,414
No prescriptions.

00:14:44,481 --> 00:14:46,249
Well, I don't think
that means much.

00:14:46,316 --> 00:14:49,319
Chances are he's not getting his
drugs from a medicine cabinet.

00:14:49,385 --> 00:14:50,887
There's no sign of struggle.

00:14:50,954 --> 00:14:53,089
Any prints would have
been washed away.

00:14:53,156 --> 00:14:54,424
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:14:54,491 --> 00:14:56,326
Where does that leave us?

00:14:56,392 --> 00:14:59,195
Same place we were when
we walked through the door--

00:14:59,262 --> 00:15:01,297
with a bloated floater.

00:15:04,367 --> 00:15:06,936
Hey, you know that cell phone
Grissom found

00:15:07,003 --> 00:15:07,704
at the crime scene?

00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:08,872
Yeah.

00:15:08,938 --> 00:15:11,541
Traced it back
to a public defender.

00:15:11,608 --> 00:15:13,143
Said she lost it.

00:15:13,209 --> 00:15:15,912
Made life hell for her
while she was in DC.

00:15:15,979 --> 00:15:17,080
Mm...

00:15:17,147 --> 00:15:21,184
Have you run a sample
of this through the GCMS?

00:15:21,251 --> 00:15:22,886
Mm-hmm. Polyethylene.

00:15:22,952 --> 00:15:25,288
Polyethylene.

00:15:25,355 --> 00:15:28,725
I got the results back
from Grissom's ant puddle.

00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:29,893
( <i>beep</i> )
Mm-hmm.

00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:33,129
Corn syrup, glucose,
caramel and water.

00:15:33,196 --> 00:15:35,165
Hang on a second.

00:15:38,635 --> 00:15:40,737
Where do you keep
the sodium rhodizinate?

00:15:40,804 --> 00:15:42,238
On top of the
file cabinet.

00:15:42,305 --> 00:15:43,439
So, what's up?

00:15:43,506 --> 00:15:45,308
You and Bobby switched or what?

00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:47,443
Hey, Rich, whatever happened
with those bullets?

00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,078
Six right nine-millimeter.

00:15:49,145 --> 00:15:50,480
Beretta, amongst others.

00:15:50,547 --> 00:15:52,882
Consistent with an
officer's duty weapon.

00:15:52,949 --> 00:15:55,518
Consistent with Officer Commons
and Officer Nowlin's weapons?

00:15:55,585 --> 00:15:57,654
No match.
That includes backups.

00:15:59,088 --> 00:16:01,391
Well, thanks.

00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:03,860
Hey, Warrick.

00:16:03,927 --> 00:16:05,028
Yeah?

00:16:05,094 --> 00:16:07,897
Polyethylene
plus corn syrup plus GSR

00:16:07,964 --> 00:16:09,098
gives you what?

00:16:09,165 --> 00:16:13,336
Polyethylene and corn syrup
is... cola in a bottle.

00:16:13,403 --> 00:16:17,340
GSR on the inside
of a plastic bottle means...

00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:19,442
Soda silencer.

00:16:22,545 --> 00:16:24,547
Poor man's silencer.

00:16:24,614 --> 00:16:27,050
Only good
for a couple shots.

00:16:27,116 --> 00:16:29,018
So, that shooter was sitting
on the house

00:16:29,085 --> 00:16:30,353
<i>and</i> the surveillance team.

00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,589
<i>Empties out</i>
<i>his bottle of soda...</i>

00:16:32,655 --> 00:16:36,459
<i>calls in an "officer down"...</i>

00:16:39,963 --> 00:16:43,800
<i>...drops the phone</i>
<i>and takes a walk.</i>

00:16:45,735 --> 00:16:47,804
What do you think?

00:16:50,306 --> 00:16:51,608
Who do we have around here

00:16:51,674 --> 00:16:54,144
that could find us
a somewhat used soda bottle?

00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:55,892
Hey.

00:19:55,959 --> 00:19:57,060
Floater's shirt.

00:19:57,126 --> 00:19:59,295
Took it off his bed.

00:19:59,362 --> 00:20:02,999
What does this look like to you?

00:20:04,033 --> 00:20:05,802
A backwards seven.

00:20:05,869 --> 00:20:08,972
Yeah, that's what I got.

00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:10,940
What's it doing on a DB's shirt?

00:20:11,007 --> 00:20:13,476
I don't know.

00:20:22,185 --> 00:20:24,921
Some kind of greasepaint
or makeup.

00:20:24,988 --> 00:20:26,990
How do you get paint
on the inside of your clothes?

00:20:27,056 --> 00:20:29,492
Rubs off your chest.

00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:32,796
Oh, what kind of guy
paints his chest?

00:20:32,862 --> 00:20:34,097
Performance artist?

00:20:34,164 --> 00:20:35,632
A clown maybe?

00:20:35,698 --> 00:20:38,134
Sports freak.

00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:42,438
Well, it's not like you
to have a one-track mind.

00:20:42,505 --> 00:20:44,440
If the evidence points
to cops, we chase cops.

00:20:44,507 --> 00:20:45,675
Jesse Commons
and Bill Nowlin

00:20:45,742 --> 00:20:47,210
were doing what
I asked them to do.

00:20:47,277 --> 00:20:48,545
They were sitting
on the house.

00:20:48,611 --> 00:20:50,346
Until you can get
enough physical evidence

00:20:50,413 --> 00:20:51,347
to support a warrant.

00:20:51,414 --> 00:20:53,383
Somebody knew we were looking
at the Klinefelds.

00:20:53,449 --> 00:20:54,617
They knew where they lived.

00:20:54,684 --> 00:20:55,785
That's somebody inside.

00:20:55,852 --> 00:20:57,620
Cops don't take the law
into their own hands.

00:20:57,687 --> 00:20:58,788
Ha! In what city?

00:20:58,855 --> 00:21:00,857
Oh, you want to hit
below the belt?

00:21:00,924 --> 00:21:04,194
You know, a lot of people
had access to the Klinefelds.

00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,062
Who knows, maybe
CSI III Nicky Stokes

00:21:06,129 --> 00:21:08,898
opened up his mouth to another
parking lot attendant.

00:21:10,133 --> 00:21:12,368
There was an eyewitness
who saw a uniform

00:21:12,435 --> 00:21:13,436
at the front door.

00:21:13,503 --> 00:21:16,105
Oh, come on,
a ten-year-old insomniac kid,

00:21:16,172 --> 00:21:18,675
hyped up on sugar,
going blind on X-Box.

00:21:18,741 --> 00:21:20,143
Who knows what he saw?

00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:21,845
So, now you're discrediting
your own witness?

00:21:21,911 --> 00:21:23,480
All right, let's break it down.

00:21:23,546 --> 00:21:26,049
You got a public defender's
cell phone, no prints.

00:21:26,115 --> 00:21:29,085
You got officers' weapons
taken from the scene, not fired.

00:21:29,152 --> 00:21:30,687
You got officers' shoe prints,

00:21:30,753 --> 00:21:32,288
not matching the
evidence print.

00:21:32,355 --> 00:21:34,324
You got three
black-and-whites
confirming

00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:36,926
that Commons and Nowlin
responded to a 444.

00:21:36,993 --> 00:21:38,394
Give these guys a break.

00:21:38,461 --> 00:21:39,662
Just because
they weren't the shooters

00:21:39,729 --> 00:21:40,864
doesn't mean
they weren't involved.

00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:42,465
Oh, what,
so it's a conspiracy?
Oh, please!

00:21:42,532 --> 00:21:44,434
You got a bogus 444 call
two blocks away.

00:21:44,501 --> 00:21:45,902
Oh, come on, you
know the deal.

00:21:45,969 --> 00:21:46,903
You know better than that.

00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:48,404
There's bogus calls
come in every day.

00:21:48,471 --> 00:21:50,306
Well, maybe you don't,
because you're the kind of guy

00:21:50,373 --> 00:21:51,808
who goes to serve a warrant
without a gun.

00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:53,376
I'm not a cop.

00:21:53,443 --> 00:21:55,011
Well, that's a distinction
that could be lost

00:21:55,078 --> 00:21:56,579
when the suspect's
still inside the house.

00:21:56,646 --> 00:21:58,047
Look, I had your back.

00:21:58,114 --> 00:22:00,083
Now I expect you to have mine.

00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:01,084
That's not the way it works.

00:22:01,151 --> 00:22:02,051
In what city?

00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:06,256
Hey, guys?
I found something.

00:22:06,322 --> 00:22:07,056
Not now.

00:22:07,123 --> 00:22:08,691
No. You need to see this.

00:22:10,226 --> 00:22:11,961
Both of you. Now!

00:22:13,963 --> 00:22:15,632
Please.

00:22:33,983 --> 00:22:35,919
Sorry I didn't find
the soda bottle.

00:22:38,154 --> 00:22:40,924
This'll do.

00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:49,776
Star-1 Uniforms.

00:22:49,843 --> 00:22:51,945
It's the biggest
uniform shop in town.

00:22:52,012 --> 00:22:55,115
From casino
dealers to cops.

00:22:55,182 --> 00:22:56,183
Shirt's wet.

00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:58,051
I found it in a storm drain.

00:22:58,118 --> 00:22:59,619
Where exactly?

00:22:59,686 --> 00:23:00,687
Two blocks west
of the house.

00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:02,856
Opposite direction
from the 444.

00:23:06,626 --> 00:23:07,994
Buttons.

00:23:08,061 --> 00:23:10,130
Meaning?

00:23:10,197 --> 00:23:12,733
All the new uniforms
have zippers.

00:23:17,304 --> 00:23:18,805
This collar's dry.

00:23:18,872 --> 00:23:20,307
It's hot out--

00:23:20,374 --> 00:23:22,209
at least
a buck twenty-five.

00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:24,010
Let's hope whoever was wearing
that shirt sweats.

00:23:29,149 --> 00:23:30,751
The badge looks legit.

00:23:30,817 --> 00:23:33,353
I'll run the number.

00:23:38,892 --> 00:23:41,995
MAN:
Roommates were unable
to make a positive ID

00:23:42,062 --> 00:23:44,531
due to the accelerated
decomposition,

00:23:44,598 --> 00:23:48,268
but dental records confirmed
Daniel O'Hannissey.

00:23:48,335 --> 00:23:51,371
Laceration
on the forehead--

00:23:51,438 --> 00:23:53,940
macerated, but not significant.

00:23:54,007 --> 00:23:55,909
Contusion
with a small laceration...

00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:57,878
here, below the ear.

00:23:57,944 --> 00:23:59,713
That did some damage.

00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:02,115
There's an obvious hematoma
in the subdural space

00:24:02,182 --> 00:24:04,084
consistent with
a subdural bleed.

00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:07,254
Herniation of the Uncinate
Process on the same side.

00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,956
Doc, uh, why is his brain green?

00:24:10,023 --> 00:24:11,158
He was steamed.

00:24:11,224 --> 00:24:13,894
Turns the brain
into lime gelatin.

00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,462
Cause of death?

00:24:15,529 --> 00:24:16,463
Ruled out drowning.

00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:17,697
There was no water
in the lungs.

00:24:17,764 --> 00:24:20,033
He was dead before
he hit the water.

00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,436
So, you are looking at it--

00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:24,571
a blow to the back of the head.

00:24:24,638 --> 00:24:26,273
Resulted in a
subdural hematoma.

00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:29,309
Sort of like a slow
leak in a tire.

00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:31,478
A slow leak in a tire?

00:24:31,545 --> 00:24:33,013
Odds are Danny had no idea

00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,648
he was bleeding
in his brain.

00:24:34,715 --> 00:24:35,716
He probably felt fine.

00:24:35,782 --> 00:24:37,284
Maybe a little woozy.

00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,119
Then out of nowhere, he drops.

00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:41,288
How long do you think
he lived after the blow?

00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:42,989
12 to 24 hours.

00:24:44,391 --> 00:24:45,892
Well, he had to have been
in the water

00:24:45,959 --> 00:24:48,161
for a couple of days
to look like this.

00:24:48,228 --> 00:24:49,963
Roommates last saw him Thursday.

00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:52,733
So I guess we start there
and we work backwards.

00:24:53,734 --> 00:24:54,735
Thanks.

00:24:54,801 --> 00:24:55,635
Yeah.

00:24:57,137 --> 00:24:58,739
I lost my badge years ago.

00:24:58,805 --> 00:25:01,074
Filed a report.
Got issued a new one.

00:25:01,141 --> 00:25:04,845
Yeah, I'm aware of officers
"losing" their badges.

00:25:04,911 --> 00:25:06,680
Then we don't have
a problem, do we?

00:25:06,747 --> 00:25:08,081
No, we got a problem
'cause your badge

00:25:08,148 --> 00:25:09,683
was found in the proximity
of a crime scene.

00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:12,819
How'd you manage
to lose your badge?

00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:15,155
Such is life.

00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:17,124
That's not the answer
I was hoping for.

00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:19,426
BRASS:
I've been looking
at your jacket.

00:25:19,493 --> 00:25:20,460
Reads like a novel.

00:25:20,527 --> 00:25:22,362
You got a lot of entries
in here.

00:25:22,429 --> 00:25:24,598
You got, uh...
beat-and-release.

00:25:24,664 --> 00:25:26,666
You got some stick therapy.
What's up with this?

00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:28,435
Show me a cop without a
few entries in his jacket,

00:25:28,502 --> 00:25:30,937
I'll show you a pogue.

00:25:31,004 --> 00:25:33,940
You referring to me?

00:25:34,007 --> 00:25:35,942
Guys like you get to sit
on your ass behind a desk

00:25:36,009 --> 00:25:38,211
because guys like me are
out there doing the real work.

00:25:38,278 --> 00:25:41,081
BRASS:
Okay, tough guy,
tell me what you know.

00:25:41,148 --> 00:25:44,017
I lost my badge.
End of story.

00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:47,020
If I ever find the guy
who stole it, believe...

00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:48,455
I want my union rep.

00:25:48,522 --> 00:25:49,823
I'm it.

00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:51,124
I want somebody impartial.

00:25:51,191 --> 00:25:52,392
Well, I was impartial.

00:25:52,459 --> 00:25:53,660
Now open up.

00:25:58,999 --> 00:26:00,367
You went for a bottle
and found a shirt?

00:26:00,434 --> 00:26:02,436
This swab is your new priority.

00:26:02,502 --> 00:26:03,670
I was just filling
Nick in...

00:26:03,737 --> 00:26:04,671
Fill me in first.

00:26:04,738 --> 00:26:05,906
The sweat stain?

00:26:05,972 --> 00:26:07,708
Uh, I was just
getting started.

00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:08,742
I can do them
both together.

00:26:08,809 --> 00:26:09,743
The shoe print?

00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:11,144
Running it through Limbic.

00:26:11,211 --> 00:26:14,081
How can you be doing that
when you're standing here?

00:26:14,147 --> 00:26:15,816
MAN ( <i>on tape</i> ):
I'm at the corner
of Harmon Hill and 25th.

00:26:15,882 --> 00:26:16,817
Just east of the intersection.

00:26:16,883 --> 00:26:17,918
There's been a shooting.

00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:19,019
I think a cop got shot.

00:26:19,086 --> 00:26:21,021
John, oh...
Just occurred.

00:26:21,088 --> 00:26:22,189
I heard shots.

00:26:22,255 --> 00:26:23,657
Where are we?

00:26:23,724 --> 00:26:25,692
Check it out.

00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:27,561
I think a cop got shot.

00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:29,629
John, oh...
Just occurred.

00:26:29,696 --> 00:26:30,931
I heard shots.

00:26:30,997 --> 00:26:32,999
I have never heard
a citizen that calm.

00:26:33,066 --> 00:26:35,502
This 911 caller
knew the drill.

00:26:35,569 --> 00:26:37,337
He's using officers code.

00:26:37,404 --> 00:26:38,772
'J' becomes john.

00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:40,040
'O' becomes ocean.

00:26:40,107 --> 00:26:42,008
J.O.-- just occurred.

00:26:42,075 --> 00:26:43,944
Old habits die hard.

00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:44,945
I'm only halfway home.

00:26:45,011 --> 00:26:46,012
I need a voice exemplar.

00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:47,547
Did you get a name
off that badge?

00:26:47,614 --> 00:26:48,882
Yeah.

00:26:48,949 --> 00:26:51,551
You know, Daniel
was from Green Bay.

00:26:51,618 --> 00:26:53,920
Big-time diehard
football fan.

00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:55,622
He tried to walk-on
here, but, uh...

00:26:55,689 --> 00:26:57,924
didn't make the team.

00:26:57,991 --> 00:27:02,195
But, hey, come game night,
he was always at the stadium.

00:27:02,262 --> 00:27:03,730
What about the away games?

00:27:03,797 --> 00:27:04,998
He watched one game at home

00:27:05,065 --> 00:27:06,733
and lost all of his
chill privileges.

00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,969
It was ugly.

00:27:09,035 --> 00:27:10,437
Define ugly.

00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:12,472
Busted the couch,
jumping on it.

00:27:12,539 --> 00:27:15,142
Neighbors called the cops
'cause he was so loud.

00:27:15,208 --> 00:27:16,576
He was a real Bluto.

00:27:16,643 --> 00:27:18,779
Where else did he 'Bluto'?

00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:22,249
( <i>loud rock music plays</i> )

00:27:22,315 --> 00:27:23,784
Everybody knew Dan-o.

00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:24,785
He's the kind of guy

00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:26,286
that keeps a place
like this in business.

00:27:27,587 --> 00:27:28,889
I'm going to miss him.

00:27:28,955 --> 00:27:30,524
When was the last time
you saw him?

00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:32,726
When was the last Rebel game?

00:27:32,793 --> 00:27:34,027
Thursday.

00:27:34,094 --> 00:27:35,095
Did you notice anything?

00:27:35,162 --> 00:27:36,096
Did he...

00:27:36,163 --> 00:27:36,797
feel okay?

00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:37,798
Better than okay.

00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:38,932
He was pumped.

00:27:38,999 --> 00:27:40,467
He was so pumped that him

00:27:40,534 --> 00:27:41,668
and some of his buddies
got into it

00:27:41,735 --> 00:27:42,669
with some other guys.

00:27:42,736 --> 00:27:44,371
Wh-What do you mean?
He started a fight?

00:27:44,438 --> 00:27:46,440
No, Shirley Temple
started the fight.

00:27:46,506 --> 00:27:50,010
Right there!
Right there!

00:27:50,077 --> 00:27:51,578
( <i>hooting</i> )

00:27:51,645 --> 00:27:53,280
Drinks for the guys down there.

00:27:55,348 --> 00:27:58,452
Shirley Temples--
extra cherries.

00:27:58,518 --> 00:28:00,654
Shirley Temples all around.

00:28:02,155 --> 00:28:03,757
Hey, Wayne, those
are for you, buddy.

00:28:03,824 --> 00:28:05,459
Those are for you
and your boys.

00:28:05,525 --> 00:28:07,461
How did Shirley take it?

00:28:07,527 --> 00:28:09,863
Not so good.

00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:11,898
Come here, tough guy.

00:28:13,834 --> 00:28:14,768
( <i>cheering and applause</i> )

00:28:14,835 --> 00:28:16,503
( <i>yelling</i> ):
Yeah!

00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:17,604
You know how guys are.

00:28:17,671 --> 00:28:19,706
They scrap until someone
gets a touchdown.

00:28:19,773 --> 00:28:22,609
Yeah. Yeah, right.

00:28:22,676 --> 00:28:25,612
Do you see any of those guys
in here now?

00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:31,184
There's a couple of Shirleys
over there by the big screen.

00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:37,357
BROWN:
<i>Jen, I need a sample</i>
<i>of Fromansky's voice.</i>

00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:39,726
What's it worth to you?

00:28:39,793 --> 00:28:41,561
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:28:41,628 --> 00:28:42,562
Drinks?

00:28:42,629 --> 00:28:45,365
I don't think you understand.

00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:47,834
FROMANSKY ( <i>on tape</i> ):
Officer in pursuit
of late-model Honda Civic.

00:28:47,901 --> 00:28:48,835
Possibly stolen.

00:28:48,902 --> 00:28:50,637
Heading northbound
on Koval Lane.

00:28:50,704 --> 00:28:52,072
( <i>clicks off tape</i> )
Hold on.

00:28:52,139 --> 00:28:55,709
Now, I've got three full minutes
of Officer Fromansky here.

00:28:55,776 --> 00:28:58,545
I was thinking of
maybe taking it

00:28:58,612 --> 00:29:00,414
to the Dispatch Convention.

00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,516
Oh, no, no.
Okay, okay.

00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:06,053
Drinks at my place.

00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:08,188
I can make that dub for you.

00:29:08,255 --> 00:29:09,456
What time?

00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:31,778
Got a second?

00:29:31,845 --> 00:29:34,214
You're a suspect
in an ongoing investigation.

00:29:34,281 --> 00:29:36,550
We're not allowed to have
a conversation.

00:29:37,951 --> 00:29:39,953
Let me tell you something,
you arrogant clod.

00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,922
I didn't shoot
your suspects.

00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:43,557
Wouldn't waste my life on them.

00:29:43,623 --> 00:29:44,791
Well, if that's true,

00:29:44,858 --> 00:29:47,094
then your DNA sample
will rule you out.

00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:51,264
Someday, you're going to need me
or my buddies at a scene...

00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:53,433
and wouldn't
you know it--

00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,669
we all hit traffic on the way.

00:29:57,104 --> 00:29:59,973
Is that how you do your job,
Officer?

00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:02,743
Have a safe night.

00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:12,419
( <i>multiple voice prints</i>
<i>running</i> )

00:30:12,486 --> 00:30:14,588
Officer in pursuit
of late-model Honda Civic...

00:30:14,654 --> 00:30:15,589
Just occurred...

00:30:15,655 --> 00:30:16,590
I heard shots.

00:30:16,656 --> 00:30:17,791
Heading northbound...

00:30:17,858 --> 00:30:19,426
Just east of the intersection.

00:30:19,493 --> 00:30:20,494
There's been a...

00:30:23,397 --> 00:30:25,232
Pitch, speed, volume--

00:30:25,298 --> 00:30:26,700
they're all different.

00:30:26,767 --> 00:30:28,502
It's not even close.

00:30:28,568 --> 00:30:30,871
Maybe he disguised his voice.

00:30:30,937 --> 00:30:32,439
There's no
distortion.

00:30:32,506 --> 00:30:34,875
Fromansky didn't make that call,
Gris.

00:30:36,643 --> 00:30:38,612
The, uh, sweat
from the uniform

00:30:38,678 --> 00:30:40,947
not a match
to Officer Fromansky.

00:30:54,582 --> 00:30:57,018
You're a hard guy to find.

00:30:58,552 --> 00:31:00,154
I messed up, Jim.

00:31:00,221 --> 00:31:03,491
I got ahead of the evidence.

00:31:03,558 --> 00:31:05,526
I made it personal,
and I don't know why.

00:31:08,129 --> 00:31:10,831
We both got a little stubborn.

00:31:10,898 --> 00:31:14,101
Did a little head-butting.

00:31:14,168 --> 00:31:15,436
I kind of liked it.

00:31:15,503 --> 00:31:18,306
You were like
your old self there.

00:31:18,372 --> 00:31:19,473
Anyway...

00:31:21,676 --> 00:31:23,377
Fromansky was my idea, too.

00:31:23,444 --> 00:31:25,780
I still think
it's somebody inside.

00:31:25,846 --> 00:31:29,216
Pull off a murder like this,
it takes some practice.

00:31:29,283 --> 00:31:32,420
So... one thing I remembered.

00:31:32,486 --> 00:31:33,688
About six or seven months ago,

00:31:33,754 --> 00:31:36,490
we arrested a couple
of gang-bangers.

00:31:36,557 --> 00:31:38,626
They were popping
blackjack dealers

00:31:38,693 --> 00:31:40,061
on their way home from work,

00:31:40,127 --> 00:31:41,195
taking their toke envelopes.

00:31:41,262 --> 00:31:44,699
Because of some
technicality,

00:31:44,765 --> 00:31:45,967
Judge Slater
let them walk

00:31:46,033 --> 00:31:47,635
right out of the courtroom.

00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:51,138
I mean, they were talking
about this

00:31:51,205 --> 00:31:52,373
in the precinct for weeks.

00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,576
Now this morality play
has a very quick

00:31:55,643 --> 00:31:57,445
and unhappy ending.

00:31:57,511 --> 00:31:58,546
Somebody shot them.

00:31:58,613 --> 00:32:00,581
Vigilantes?

00:32:00,648 --> 00:32:02,016
Maybe.

00:32:02,083 --> 00:32:04,385
But still,

00:32:04,452 --> 00:32:06,721
I don't like a cop for this.

00:32:07,822 --> 00:32:10,157
So take the cops out.

00:32:10,224 --> 00:32:12,193
Who's left?

00:32:53,768 --> 00:32:54,769
"All for

00:32:54,835 --> 00:32:56,737
Our Country."

00:32:56,804 --> 00:32:59,373
That's what
he probably told himself.

00:33:10,418 --> 00:33:12,386
Like I told you before,
if you're here for a warrant,

00:33:12,453 --> 00:33:14,755
you better have evidence
to back it up.

00:33:14,822 --> 00:33:16,591
We're not here
to get a warrant, Judge.

00:33:16,657 --> 00:33:19,493
We're here to serve one.

00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:22,063
Wayne, you want to tell us
about the game Friday night?

00:33:22,129 --> 00:33:24,398
You mean like strategy?
Chalk talk?

00:33:24,465 --> 00:33:27,101
Start with the Shirley Temples
and go from there.

00:33:27,168 --> 00:33:28,436
( <i>laughs</i> )

00:33:28,502 --> 00:33:30,338
You're talking about
those idiots from UNLV.

00:33:30,404 --> 00:33:33,107
We have a witness that said
you guys had a beef.

00:33:33,174 --> 00:33:34,141
Specifically,

00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:35,776
you and Number Seven.

00:33:35,843 --> 00:33:37,878
Dude, I don't even
know those guys, okay?

00:33:37,945 --> 00:33:39,647
They came in,
they tried to be funny,

00:33:39,714 --> 00:33:41,082
and we set
them straight.

00:33:41,148 --> 00:33:42,350
How?

00:33:42,416 --> 00:33:44,318
Gave them a little talking to.

00:33:44,385 --> 00:33:46,454
Any blows exchanged?
Physical contact?

00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:49,290
Did that punk bitch rat us out?

00:33:49,357 --> 00:33:51,259
It was harmless.

00:33:51,325 --> 00:33:52,426
It was nothing.

00:33:52,493 --> 00:33:54,095
Punk bitch?

00:33:54,161 --> 00:33:55,463
A kid is dead.

00:33:56,931 --> 00:33:57,965
What?

00:33:58,032 --> 00:34:00,034
Dan O'Hannissey is dead.

00:34:01,903 --> 00:34:04,372
I didn't do anything.

00:34:04,438 --> 00:34:07,008
Hey, that guy left
before we did, and he was fine.

00:34:07,074 --> 00:34:08,209
He was still running his mouth.

00:34:08,276 --> 00:34:10,344
I suppose your buddies
will testify to that?

00:34:10,411 --> 00:34:11,913
Yeah, they'll testify to that.

00:34:11,979 --> 00:34:13,814
Look, you can ask anybody
who was in there.

00:34:15,783 --> 00:34:17,685
Interesting ring you've got on.

00:34:20,354 --> 00:34:21,556
The SMU Sharks.

00:34:21,622 --> 00:34:24,992
That's a college ring.

00:34:25,059 --> 00:34:26,160
Mind if I borrow it?

00:34:26,227 --> 00:34:27,562
You want to borrow my ring?

00:34:27,628 --> 00:34:29,864
Yeah.

00:34:29,931 --> 00:34:31,599
Okay.

00:34:32,667 --> 00:34:34,235
Take it.

00:34:35,703 --> 00:34:36,637
I didn't do anything.

00:34:36,704 --> 00:34:40,274
You're not under arrest.
You're free to go.

00:34:42,276 --> 00:34:44,412
You have a lot of nerve
walking in my chambers

00:34:44,478 --> 00:34:45,546
accusing me of murder.

00:34:45,613 --> 00:34:46,747
I'm not accusing you
of murder.

00:34:46,814 --> 00:34:47,915
I just want

00:34:47,982 --> 00:34:49,050
to see your shoes.

00:34:49,116 --> 00:34:50,818
You've a warrant
to search my closet?
We need to see

00:34:50,885 --> 00:34:51,919
all your shoes.

00:34:51,986 --> 00:34:53,754
That goes for your bailiff
and your clerk as well.

00:34:53,821 --> 00:34:55,923
Gentlemen, please
remove your shoes.

00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:58,526
I'm sure you'd want
to set an example for all

00:34:58,593 --> 00:34:59,794
court employees.

00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,996
The warrant is limited to me,
my clerk and the bailiff?

00:35:02,063 --> 00:35:03,164
The Klinefeld

00:35:03,231 --> 00:35:05,166
warrant was generated
from this office,

00:35:05,233 --> 00:35:07,368
and only you three had access
to their personal information,

00:35:07,435 --> 00:35:09,604
so... yeah.

00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:11,105
I look forward to the day

00:35:11,172 --> 00:35:13,474
you return
to my courtroom, Detective.

00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:17,178
Who issued
the warrant?

00:35:17,245 --> 00:35:19,380
Judge Correll.

00:35:19,447 --> 00:35:20,381
Good judge.

00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:22,316
Always count on him for paper.

00:35:24,952 --> 00:35:27,455
Not this pair.

00:35:35,563 --> 00:35:36,998
Not those.

00:35:38,766 --> 00:35:40,434
You a smoker?

00:35:40,501 --> 00:35:42,436
Is that a crime?

00:35:42,503 --> 00:35:44,438
It's not good for you.

00:36:04,025 --> 00:36:05,626
What tipped you to the ring?

00:36:05,693 --> 00:36:06,994
<i>Jaws.</i>

00:36:07,061 --> 00:36:08,996
Peter Benchley's <i>Jaws?</i>

00:36:09,063 --> 00:36:12,700
No, it was in Steven
Spielberg's <i>Jaws.</i>

00:36:12,767 --> 00:36:15,102
They had this mechanical
shark named Bruce.

00:36:15,169 --> 00:36:16,470
And he kept swimming
round and round

00:36:16,537 --> 00:36:17,838
in circles.

00:36:17,905 --> 00:36:19,006
How come?

00:36:19,073 --> 00:36:21,809
His dorsal fin was bent.

00:36:24,412 --> 00:36:26,080
How did Bruce's

00:36:26,147 --> 00:36:27,748
fin get bent?

00:36:27,815 --> 00:36:29,550
Same way the kid's ring did.

00:36:30,718 --> 00:36:32,186
It hit something.

00:36:33,387 --> 00:36:36,657
Don't be pushing, buddy!

00:36:36,724 --> 00:36:38,292
Come on!

00:36:38,359 --> 00:36:42,730
( <i>cheering</i> )

00:36:47,401 --> 00:36:48,536
Come on. Come on!

00:36:48,603 --> 00:36:50,304
Come on!

00:36:50,371 --> 00:36:53,708
Forget it, man.

00:36:55,409 --> 00:36:56,844
You got to be kidding me.

00:36:56,911 --> 00:36:58,713
You threw a punch.

00:36:58,779 --> 00:37:00,181
Probably a sucker punch.

00:37:00,248 --> 00:37:03,150
Look, I told you,
that guy walked away.

00:37:03,217 --> 00:37:04,785
But he was already dying.

00:37:04,852 --> 00:37:06,254
And you're responsible.

00:37:07,922 --> 00:37:10,691
Now who's the punk... bitch?

00:37:18,065 --> 00:37:21,002
This is Detective Jim Brass,
Las Vegas Police Department.

00:37:21,068 --> 00:37:22,904
Interview Room "A."

00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:26,874
I'm with Stuart Gardner,
County Court Clerk.

00:37:26,941 --> 00:37:31,379
Please, um,
state your name.

00:37:31,445 --> 00:37:34,448
Stuart Gardner.
G-a-r-d-n-e-r.

00:37:34,515 --> 00:37:37,184
And spell it for the record.

00:37:37,251 --> 00:37:38,386
That's right.
You used to be a cop.

00:37:38,452 --> 00:37:41,155
Once a cop, always a cop.

00:37:41,222 --> 00:37:42,823
You and I are brothers.

00:37:46,527 --> 00:37:49,230
I'm not your brother.

00:37:57,071 --> 00:37:58,706
You're a murderer.

00:37:58,773 --> 00:38:01,409
I have a warrant
to search these premises.

00:38:01,475 --> 00:38:03,978
This is crap.
You can't arrest me.

00:38:06,147 --> 00:38:08,249
I'm not here to arrest you.

00:38:08,316 --> 00:38:11,118
What, wait a second...

00:38:21,062 --> 00:38:25,666
We also found
your old uniform shirt,

00:38:25,733 --> 00:38:27,034
with your DNA on the collar.

00:38:29,837 --> 00:38:31,272
What are you going to retire on?

00:38:31,339 --> 00:38:34,408
Psych? Medical?
What?

00:38:34,475 --> 00:38:36,944
Weren't you close to retirement?

00:38:37,011 --> 00:38:39,113
After you shot that bystander?

00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:41,549
Ah, you want
to talk about me, huh?

00:38:45,353 --> 00:38:48,155
You're a clerk.
Get your facts straight.

00:38:48,222 --> 00:38:49,390
He wasn't a bystander.

00:38:49,457 --> 00:38:51,392
He was a passenger
in a felony pursuit.

00:38:52,693 --> 00:38:55,296
So how'd you get promoted
to Captain after that?

00:38:55,363 --> 00:38:57,365
Must be my good looks.
You agreed

00:38:57,431 --> 00:38:58,532
to drive a desk...

00:38:58,599 --> 00:39:02,136
at CSI...
with all the sleazy civilians.

00:39:02,203 --> 00:39:04,005
Don't knock the CSI, Stuart.

00:39:04,071 --> 00:39:05,840
They put a lot of bad guys away.

00:39:05,907 --> 00:39:08,009
You know, I'm going
to give you

00:39:08,075 --> 00:39:10,611
a little therapy for free.

00:39:10,678 --> 00:39:15,116
You know, if you had only shown
a little restraint,

00:39:15,182 --> 00:39:18,085
they would have processed
the DNA after Klinefelds'.

00:39:18,152 --> 00:39:19,787
Slam-dunk case.

00:39:19,854 --> 00:39:22,823
Lots of guys get off
on slam-dunk cases.

00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:24,792
Yeah, I bet you saw
a lot of that working

00:39:24,859 --> 00:39:27,194
for Judge Slater,
most liberal judge in the state.

00:39:27,261 --> 00:39:30,197
Bet you saw
a lot of good cases go south,

00:39:30,264 --> 00:39:32,800
while you just processed
those release forms,

00:39:32,867 --> 00:39:34,835
huh?

00:39:34,902 --> 00:39:37,138
Let me ask you
something.

00:39:44,979 --> 00:39:48,082
Doesn't it piss you off
to put all your hard work

00:39:48,149 --> 00:39:49,684
in the hands
of 12 people

00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:51,886
too stupid to get
off jury duty?

00:39:55,489 --> 00:39:58,092
Stuart, sit down.

00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:05,266
WARRICK:
This guy's a nut job

00:40:05,333 --> 00:40:07,868
vigilante.

00:40:07,935 --> 00:40:10,338
He's making the whole department
look bad.

00:40:10,404 --> 00:40:14,141
I guess he'd just figured
he'd take a shortcut.

00:40:16,644 --> 00:40:18,679
You've thought about it.

00:40:18,746 --> 00:40:21,816
Yeah... lots of times.

00:40:23,751 --> 00:40:25,286
What about you?
