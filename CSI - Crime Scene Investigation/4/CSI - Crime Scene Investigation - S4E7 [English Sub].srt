00:00:08,164 --> 00:00:11,101
I searched the vehicle
at the CSI garage.

00:00:11,167 --> 00:00:13,737
I discovered the knife
under the passenger's seat.

00:00:13,803 --> 00:00:17,941
Now, is this
the knife you found?

00:00:19,543 --> 00:00:20,644
Yes, it is.

00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:21,645
Hmm.

00:00:21,711 --> 00:00:24,281
Who was the registered owner
of the vehicle?

00:00:24,347 --> 00:00:27,584
Michael Fife,
the defendant.

00:00:27,651 --> 00:00:31,254
Please describe the physical
condition of the knife

00:00:31,321 --> 00:00:32,956
when you discovered it.

00:00:33,023 --> 00:00:35,759
The knife was wrapped
in a white towel.

00:00:35,825 --> 00:00:37,360
Both the towel
and the knife

00:00:37,427 --> 00:00:38,962
were caked
with dried blood.

00:00:39,029 --> 00:00:42,365
And how did you process
this evidence?

00:00:42,432 --> 00:00:44,434
I swabbed the blood

00:00:44,501 --> 00:00:45,602
and sent a sample
to the DNA lab.

00:00:45,669 --> 00:00:48,104
The lab technician ran
the sample through CODIS.

00:00:48,171 --> 00:00:50,607
The DNA sample was a match

00:00:50,674 --> 00:00:53,543
to a recent rape and homicide
victim, Rachel Lyford.

00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,446
Rachel Lyford who lived

00:00:56,513 --> 00:00:59,549
in unit seven of the Saturn Arms
Apartment complex.

00:00:59,616 --> 00:01:02,152
The same complex
as the defendant?

00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:03,153
That's correct.

00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:06,256
Is this knife
consistent in size

00:01:06,323 --> 00:01:09,259
and shape to the fatal wounds
sustained by Rachel Lyford?

00:01:09,326 --> 00:01:10,360
Yes, it is.

00:01:10,427 --> 00:01:11,461
Thank you.

00:01:11,528 --> 00:01:12,896
Your Honor, we have

00:01:12,963 --> 00:01:14,631
no further questions
for CSI Brown.

00:01:14,698 --> 00:01:17,133
Mr. Matthews.

00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,271
Mr. Brown, you stated
that you found the knife

00:01:21,338 --> 00:01:22,505
in Mr. Fife's vehicle.

00:01:22,572 --> 00:01:23,506
Is that correct?

00:01:23,573 --> 00:01:24,841
Yes, that's correct.

00:01:24,908 --> 00:01:26,476
Why did you search his vehicle?

00:01:26,543 --> 00:01:28,945
I received a call
from Officer Watson.

00:01:29,012 --> 00:01:31,348
He informed me that he had
pulled the defendant over

00:01:31,414 --> 00:01:32,949
to cite him
for a broken taillight.

00:01:33,016 --> 00:01:35,118
After running his plates,
it was discovered

00:01:35,185 --> 00:01:37,654
that the defendant had an
outstanding warrant for drugs.

00:01:37,721 --> 00:01:41,491
He then arrested Mr. Fife
and ordered a respond and tow.

00:01:41,558 --> 00:01:43,493
At which point,
he asked me

00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,861
to search the vehicle
for drugs.

00:01:44,928 --> 00:01:47,030
That's when I
found the knife.

00:01:47,097 --> 00:01:48,899
Mm-hmm.

00:01:48,965 --> 00:01:51,535
At what point
did you secure the warrant

00:01:51,601 --> 00:01:53,570
to search Mr. Fife's vehicle?

00:01:57,107 --> 00:01:59,175
Officer Watson
would have secured

00:01:59,242 --> 00:02:01,611
the warrant prior
to calling me.

00:02:01,678 --> 00:02:04,514
Officer Watson
never secured a warrant.

00:02:08,418 --> 00:02:09,986
Did you?

00:02:13,189 --> 00:02:14,724
No.

00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,061
Your Honor, the knife
is a product

00:02:18,128 --> 00:02:19,396
of an unlawful search,

00:02:19,462 --> 00:02:20,864
and under NRS
Chapter 179,

00:02:20,931 --> 00:02:23,333
we submit the knife and the
towel be ruled inadmissible.

00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,467
Furthermore, all evidence

00:02:24,534 --> 00:02:26,169
acquired as a result
of the seizure

00:02:26,236 --> 00:02:27,637
must at this time
be excluded.

00:02:27,704 --> 00:02:29,839
So ruled.

00:02:29,906 --> 00:02:31,508
Fruit of the poisonous tree.

00:02:31,575 --> 00:02:33,009
What else do you have?

00:02:33,076 --> 00:02:34,044
Additional evidence

00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,045
is pending.

00:02:35,111 --> 00:02:36,746
The knife would've been

00:02:36,813 --> 00:02:39,149
more than sufficient
for the purpose of a prelim.

00:02:39,216 --> 00:02:42,385
You have no other evidence
to present?

00:02:44,654 --> 00:02:46,423
Not at this time.

00:02:48,692 --> 00:02:50,460
I find insufficient evidence

00:02:50,527 --> 00:02:52,829
to hold the defendant over
for trial.

00:02:52,896 --> 00:02:53,830
He's free to go.

00:02:53,897 --> 00:02:54,931
Your Honor, the defendant

00:02:54,998 --> 00:02:57,000
is accused
of raping and killing

00:02:57,067 --> 00:02:58,001
a 19-year-old woman.

00:02:58,068 --> 00:03:00,003
You can't just let him
back on the street.

00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,638
Are you suggesting
that I violate

00:03:01,705 --> 00:03:03,506
his constitutional rights,
Counselor?

00:03:03,573 --> 00:03:05,208
Ask him for 24 hours.

00:03:09,112 --> 00:03:11,381
Your Honor, we received
no prior notice of this motion.

00:03:11,448 --> 00:03:12,682
Um...

00:03:12,749 --> 00:03:15,886
we would ask for a continuance
and opportunity to reopen.

00:03:17,787 --> 00:03:20,924
We're only asking for 24 hours.

00:03:25,896 --> 00:03:27,063
Okay.

00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:30,867
If you can't make your case,
Mr. Fife walks.

00:03:30,934 --> 00:03:33,436
We will recess for 24 hours.

00:03:41,912 --> 00:03:43,480
The murder weapon's been
excluded, that's all.

00:03:43,547 --> 00:03:45,382
We still have a lab full
of evidence we can process.

00:03:45,448 --> 00:03:47,350
We've been completely
blind-sided here.

00:03:47,417 --> 00:03:49,452
Brown, what is going on?

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:50,921
You got to be kidding me.

00:03:50,987 --> 00:03:52,088
You were unprepared.

00:03:52,155 --> 00:03:53,890
All the evidence
you CSIs collect,

00:03:53,957 --> 00:03:54,891
and all you bring

00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:56,259
into this courtroom is a knife?
Come on.

00:03:56,326 --> 00:03:57,327
I found the knife.

00:03:57,394 --> 00:03:58,662
I processed the knife.

00:03:58,728 --> 00:04:00,030
I presented the knife.

00:04:00,096 --> 00:04:01,364
All you had to do
was the paperwork.

00:04:01,431 --> 00:04:02,799
Yeah, blame it on the cop, huh?

00:04:02,866 --> 00:04:04,534
Look, you wouldn't even
have a suspect

00:04:04,601 --> 00:04:05,635
if I didn't pulled
that guy over.

00:04:05,702 --> 00:04:06,703
If you'd've followed protocol,

00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:07,971
our suspect would be
going to trial.

00:04:08,038 --> 00:04:09,539
If you have
a problem with CSI,

00:04:09,606 --> 00:04:11,308
file a complaint--
we're busy.

00:04:13,743 --> 00:04:16,780
What about what you said
about never rushing evidence?

00:04:16,846 --> 00:04:20,317
Well, for the next 24 hours,
we're breaking the rules.

Sheriff.

00:04:56,751 --> 00:04:57,852
We need to talk...

00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,087
...about him.

00:04:59,154 --> 00:05:01,756
Nice to finally meet
you, too, Sheriff.

00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,324
Why don't you
go ahead

00:05:03,391 --> 00:05:04,492
and start the briefing?

00:05:04,559 --> 00:05:05,727
I'll be in in a minute.

00:05:05,794 --> 00:05:06,761
Yeah.

00:05:06,828 --> 00:05:08,630
Where to?

00:05:21,609 --> 00:05:23,011
Warrick Brown
followed protocol.

00:05:23,078 --> 00:05:24,546
You cannot pin
this mess on him.

00:05:24,612 --> 00:05:27,582
Warrick Brown
was on the stand.

00:05:27,649 --> 00:05:29,117
He's the face
of the case.

00:05:29,184 --> 00:05:30,719
It's all about perception.

00:05:30,785 --> 00:05:31,720
If Fife walks,

00:05:31,786 --> 00:05:33,888
public only hears one thing--

00:05:33,955 --> 00:05:36,958
"Evidence against a killer
was thrown out of court

00:05:37,025 --> 00:05:39,527
because CSI conducted
an improper search."

00:05:39,594 --> 00:05:41,529
You think I don't know that?

00:05:41,596 --> 00:05:43,231
What the hell is this?

00:05:43,298 --> 00:05:45,233
It's irradiated
fetal pig.

00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,435
I used the tissue to determine
the effects of radiation...

00:05:47,502 --> 00:05:51,373
Look, Grissom, you and your team
have done exemplary work.

00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:53,708
Thanks to the Crime Lab,
some very difficult cases

00:05:53,775 --> 00:05:54,876
have gone our way.

00:05:54,943 --> 00:05:57,879
You've elevated the status
of the whole Bureau.

00:05:57,946 --> 00:06:00,014
Uh-huh.

00:06:00,081 --> 00:06:01,249
Then why are you here?

00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:04,853
I'm holding a press conference
in an hour

00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:06,621
where I'll be telling the media

00:06:06,688 --> 00:06:08,757
that this case is
under your purview.

00:06:10,225 --> 00:06:12,761
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:06:12,827 --> 00:06:14,796
Oh, it is about
perception, isn't it?

00:06:14,863 --> 00:06:17,465
Glad we understand each other.

00:06:19,601 --> 00:06:22,771
Uh... why don't you
call my office next week?

00:06:22,837 --> 00:06:25,140
Put a little lunch
on the books, hmm?

00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:30,745
I work nights.

00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,849
So make it a dinner.

00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,556
BROWN:
Impound towed the vehicle
to the garage.

00:06:41,623 --> 00:06:43,491
Michael Fife's
outstanding warrant

00:06:43,558 --> 00:06:44,859
was for marijuana possession,

00:06:44,926 --> 00:06:46,494
so that's what I
was looking for.

00:06:53,468 --> 00:06:57,138
I swabbed the knife and I sent
the blood sample to Greg.

00:06:57,205 --> 00:06:58,673
I ran it through CODIS

00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,775
and matched it
to another case.

00:07:00,842 --> 00:07:02,343
My case.

00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:04,612
Rachel Lyford, 19.

00:07:04,679 --> 00:07:06,147
Murdered in her apartment.

00:07:10,151 --> 00:07:12,420
The Assistant Coroner
examined the body.

00:07:12,487 --> 00:07:16,124
Based on the vaginal introitus,
he suspected rape.

00:07:16,191 --> 00:07:17,792
I processed
the scene.

00:07:17,859 --> 00:07:19,094
There was nothing probative.

00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,462
There were no prints, no DNA.

00:07:20,528 --> 00:07:22,263
Everything I collected
is in the vault.

00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:23,798
Now, once
Warrick found

00:07:23,865 --> 00:07:25,600
the knife, the D.A.
thought there was

00:07:25,667 --> 00:07:28,002
sufficient probable cause
and rushed the prelim.

00:07:28,069 --> 00:07:29,604
Further processing

00:07:29,671 --> 00:07:31,539
of the evidence
became a low priority,

00:07:31,606 --> 00:07:32,774
pending the trial date.

00:07:32,841 --> 00:07:33,975
This is a RUSH case.

00:07:34,042 --> 00:07:35,577
Everyone's in the pool
for 24 hours.

00:07:35,643 --> 00:07:37,078
Warrick, you need
to see Robbins.

00:07:37,145 --> 00:07:39,748
Have him walk you through
his notes on the autopsy.

00:07:39,814 --> 00:07:42,784
Nick, Sara, the judge issued
a warrant for Fife's vehicle.

00:07:42,851 --> 00:07:44,853
Detail is towing it
back to our garage.

00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:45,854
Hold on.

00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,122
Warrick's already searched
the car

00:07:47,188 --> 00:07:48,323
and the knife's been excluded.

00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,657
What exactly
are we hoping to find?

00:07:49,724 --> 00:07:50,859
GRISSOM:
I don't know.

00:07:50,925 --> 00:07:53,595
But the knife and the towel
are invisible evidence.

00:07:53,661 --> 00:07:55,230
The jury will never see them.

00:07:55,296 --> 00:07:57,499
So we have to find something
that's visible.

00:07:57,565 --> 00:07:59,601
Uh, listen, I recognize
the importance of this,

00:07:59,667 --> 00:08:02,137
but I'm in the middle of my
own homicide investigation.

00:08:02,203 --> 00:08:04,305
I'll talk to your detective.
Explain the deal.

00:08:04,372 --> 00:08:05,507
Well, it's not
about the detective.

00:08:05,573 --> 00:08:06,641
It's about my own
responsibility.

00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:08,343
I'm handing out assignments,
Sara.

00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:09,644
It's not a negotiation.

00:08:13,148 --> 00:08:15,884
I'll go back to the scene
and look at it with fresh eyes.

00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,886
GRISSOM:
Deadline's 4:00 P.M. tomorrow.

00:08:17,952 --> 00:08:19,521
Once more into the breach.

00:08:24,592 --> 00:08:25,660
STOKES:
That was Auto Detail.

00:08:25,727 --> 00:08:27,162
There's a traffic jam
on Flamingo.

00:08:27,228 --> 00:08:28,997
Tow truck should
be here any second.

00:08:29,064 --> 00:08:31,132
You know
what pisses me off?

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,233
Lots of things.

00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,468
Victims aren't equal.

00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,370
High profile cases
get priority.

00:08:35,437 --> 00:08:36,838
A ticking clock
gets priority.

00:08:36,905 --> 00:08:38,006
Every case is
a ticking clock.

00:08:38,073 --> 00:08:39,574
The only difference
between a cold case

00:08:39,641 --> 00:08:40,575
and a hot case is time.

00:08:40,642 --> 00:08:41,810
I don't care
if you're working

00:08:41,876 --> 00:08:43,311
on the hottest case
of your career.

00:08:43,378 --> 00:08:45,613
If your supervisor tells
you to leave a scene

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,849
to go wash his car,
you do it.

00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:50,351
You don't have a career
without a job.

00:09:01,896 --> 00:09:04,132
Heard you're on a RUSH.
Sorry.

00:09:04,199 --> 00:09:05,700
That's not the right car, man.

00:09:07,302 --> 00:09:10,372
Uh, registered owner
Michael Fife, BMW 325.

00:09:10,438 --> 00:09:12,140
Impounded ten days ago.

00:09:12,207 --> 00:09:13,508
What the hell happened?

00:09:13,575 --> 00:09:14,542
It's been pancaked.

00:09:14,609 --> 00:09:16,344
STOKES:
We can see that.

00:09:16,411 --> 00:09:17,645
Why?

00:09:17,712 --> 00:09:19,180
Hey, I just move 'em.

00:09:19,247 --> 00:09:21,983
This is evidence
in an active investigation.

00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:23,485
Paperwork mix-up?

00:09:23,551 --> 00:09:25,587
Or some moron checked
the wrong box.

00:09:25,653 --> 00:09:26,721
You can just
unload it here.

00:09:26,788 --> 00:09:28,790
Sign here.
I got to get back to the lot.

00:09:30,091 --> 00:09:31,493
Thanks.

00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:35,630
ROBBINS:
Body was released last week.
Cremated at Desert Haven.

00:09:35,697 --> 00:09:38,299
I.D.'d by the sister.
Pretty girl.

00:09:38,366 --> 00:09:40,068
Couldn't stop crying.

00:09:40,135 --> 00:09:41,770
Yeah, Rita.

00:09:41,836 --> 00:09:43,838
They were real close.

00:09:43,905 --> 00:09:45,840
Lived together up
until a couple months ago.

00:09:45,907 --> 00:09:48,209
These stab wounds look
like they're limited

00:09:48,276 --> 00:09:50,345
to the neck and upper
torso area, huh?

00:09:50,412 --> 00:09:53,148
ROBBINS:
Fatal stab was
to the left side of the neck.

00:09:53,214 --> 00:09:55,116
<i>The blade traversed</i>
<i>the subcutaneous tissue,</i>

00:09:55,183 --> 00:09:58,853
<i>sternocleido-mastoid muscle,</i>
<i>jugular venous complex,</i>

00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,655
the carotid artery
and the Vagus nerve.

00:10:00,722 --> 00:10:02,691
She bled right out.

00:10:02,757 --> 00:10:05,760
Raped.
No semen in the vaginal vault.

00:10:05,827 --> 00:10:08,363
I don't know if it's relevant,

00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:09,497
but check out the abrasion.

00:10:09,564 --> 00:10:11,032
There was something
around her neck.

00:10:11,099 --> 00:10:13,068
Noted.

00:10:13,134 --> 00:10:14,636
What is this foreign substance
on her wrist?

00:10:14,703 --> 00:10:16,671
Pre-autopsy.

00:10:16,738 --> 00:10:19,174
David snapped the photo
before he washed her body.

00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,709
He's in Clean Up.

00:10:20,775 --> 00:10:24,145
Bringing your laundry
to work again, David?

00:10:26,314 --> 00:10:27,882
I'm cleaning a pelvis.

00:10:27,949 --> 00:10:28,883
Great.

00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:30,785
I'm here about one
Rachel Lyford.

00:10:30,852 --> 00:10:32,087
You prepped her body?

00:10:32,153 --> 00:10:33,321
Yeah, ten days ago.

00:10:33,388 --> 00:10:34,689
I thought it was
Catherine's case.

00:10:34,756 --> 00:10:35,690
It's mine now.

00:10:35,757 --> 00:10:38,860
You notice this foreign
substance on her wrists?

00:10:38,927 --> 00:10:39,894
It was flaky.

00:10:39,961 --> 00:10:41,796
Like the glaze on a doughnut?

00:10:41,863 --> 00:10:42,931
I sent a sample
to Trace.

00:10:42,997 --> 00:10:43,932
Trace. Thanks.

00:10:43,998 --> 00:10:44,999
You're the man.

00:10:45,066 --> 00:10:46,067
Have fun.

00:10:49,137 --> 00:10:51,506
Sample's still running
through the GCMS.

00:10:51,573 --> 00:10:52,674
I'll let you know.

00:10:52,741 --> 00:10:54,876
How'd you know
that I was...

00:10:54,943 --> 00:10:56,311
4-1-1 from David.

00:10:56,378 --> 00:10:58,146
Hey, I heard about court today.

00:10:58,213 --> 00:11:00,081
Must have been
embarrassing, huh?

00:11:00,148 --> 00:11:03,151
Hodges, why'd you leave
L.A. again?

00:11:03,218 --> 00:11:06,521
Never mind, it's probably
none of my business.

00:11:06,588 --> 00:11:07,756
Hey, Rick, you okay?

00:11:07,822 --> 00:11:10,525
'Cause I'm here to drop
some more pressure on you.

00:11:10,592 --> 00:11:11,593
Yeah?

00:11:11,659 --> 00:11:13,962
Rachel Lyford's sister
showed up at the police station.

00:11:14,029 --> 00:11:14,963
Man, she was angry.

00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,331
She was firing
on all cylinders.

00:11:16,398 --> 00:11:17,465
I don't blame her.

00:11:17,532 --> 00:11:20,402
Apparently, Rachel wore
a silver chain around her neck.

00:11:20,468 --> 00:11:22,337
It wasn't with
her personal effects.

00:11:22,404 --> 00:11:24,272
Had her father's
Army dog tags on it

00:11:24,339 --> 00:11:25,874
and the family
wants it back.

00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,842
You came all the way
over here for dog tags?

00:11:27,909 --> 00:11:29,577
Well...

00:11:29,644 --> 00:11:32,180
the Sheriff asked me
to find it.

00:11:32,247 --> 00:11:33,882
You know, Rory Atwater's
been in office for--

00:11:33,948 --> 00:11:35,517
what?-- four months,
so it's political.

00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:37,018
He doesn't want
the victim's sister

00:11:37,085 --> 00:11:38,219
bad-mouthing
his department.

00:11:38,286 --> 00:11:39,220
Mm-hmm.

00:11:39,287 --> 00:11:40,221
Check it out.

00:11:40,288 --> 00:11:41,222
Mm-hmm.

00:11:41,289 --> 00:11:42,524
Dr. Robbins found

00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:45,026
consistent abrasions
on the back of her neck, so...

00:11:45,093 --> 00:11:46,227
that's probably
your chain.

00:11:46,294 --> 00:11:47,228
Uh-huh.
Okay.

00:11:47,295 --> 00:11:48,830
Killer took a souvenir.

00:11:48,897 --> 00:11:50,398
I'll let the Sheriff know.
Thanks.

00:11:50,465 --> 00:11:51,466
All right.

00:11:59,007 --> 00:12:00,508
What do you got?

00:12:00,575 --> 00:12:04,112
Got a print off this bottle
I found in the garbage.

00:12:04,179 --> 00:12:05,747
It was the only
bottle like it.

00:12:05,814 --> 00:12:07,282
None others
in the apartment.

00:12:07,348 --> 00:12:09,417
Need a hand?

00:12:09,484 --> 00:12:10,652
You could do the sheets.

00:12:17,726 --> 00:12:19,094
You know, the steak knife

00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,563
I found in that car
matches that set.

00:12:21,629 --> 00:12:22,897
GRISSOM:
We only found five knives

00:12:22,964 --> 00:12:23,898
in Rachel's kitchen.

00:12:23,965 --> 00:12:25,400
Five's an odd number
of steak knives.

00:12:25,467 --> 00:12:27,135
Exactly.

00:12:28,336 --> 00:12:30,805
Weapon of opportunity, perhaps?

00:12:30,872 --> 00:12:32,240
Perhaps.

00:12:52,227 --> 00:12:54,662
Grissom, what do you
make of this?

00:12:54,729 --> 00:12:59,801
We noted a similar type
substance on the girl's wrists.

00:12:59,868 --> 00:13:01,936
GRISSOM:
Doesn't look like it belongs

00:13:02,003 --> 00:13:03,705
on the victim or her sheets.

00:13:12,013 --> 00:13:12,947
Stop it.

00:13:13,014 --> 00:13:14,015
What?

00:13:14,082 --> 00:13:15,450
Watching the clock.

00:13:15,517 --> 00:13:17,352
It's just that new evidence
is coming in

00:13:17,419 --> 00:13:19,154
and the old evidence hasn't
even been processed yet.

00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,955
We're running out of time here,
you know?

00:13:21,022 --> 00:13:23,625
If you're watching the clock,
you're not watching the case.

00:13:23,692 --> 00:13:26,227
Well, not even you
can stop time.

00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:38,793
Thank you.

00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,929
Oh... I remember now.

00:14:02,249 --> 00:14:03,684
I'm reading the same book.

00:14:03,751 --> 00:14:06,787
Really? Any good?

00:14:06,854 --> 00:14:07,755
Yeah, so far.

00:14:24,338 --> 00:14:25,573
( <i>phone rings</i> )

00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:26,740
( <i>answering machine beeps</i> )

00:14:26,807 --> 00:14:28,642
Hi, it's Rachel.
Sorry I missed your call.

00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:30,744
I promise to get back to you
as soon as I can.

00:14:30,811 --> 00:14:32,213
Have a great day.

00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:33,247
( <i>machine beeps</i> )

00:14:33,314 --> 00:14:34,148
MAN:
Hey, Rachel.

00:14:34,215 --> 00:14:35,616
It's Walter. Walter Burr.

00:14:35,683 --> 00:14:39,086
We exchanged numbers at Diane's
party a few weeks ago.

00:14:39,153 --> 00:14:43,023
Anyway, just thought you might
want to grab a drink sometime.

00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,925
So, give me a call.

00:14:44,992 --> 00:14:47,428
I processed this place
for 12 straight hours.

00:14:47,495 --> 00:14:49,029
I never took a break.

00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:50,297
Couldn't eat.

00:14:50,364 --> 00:14:53,134
Yeah, my sister calls that
the CSI diet.

00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,402
She's a CSI out
in Bakersfield.

00:14:55,469 --> 00:14:57,271
Whole family wears a badge.

00:14:58,873 --> 00:15:01,075
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:15:01,142 --> 00:15:02,643
If you want to ALS again,
I'll grab the lights.

00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:05,312
No, I went over every square
inch of this place.

00:15:05,379 --> 00:15:08,482
I did the mattress, the sheets,
the floors, the cabinets.

00:15:08,549 --> 00:15:11,986
If the rapist ejaculated, he was
smart enough to use a condom.

00:15:12,052 --> 00:15:13,554
I'm no expert,

00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:16,323
but most guys can't wait
to take off their rubber jacket.

00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,625
You check the
wastebasket?

00:15:17,691 --> 00:15:18,626
Yeah, I did,

00:15:18,692 --> 00:15:20,895
but...

00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:23,597
not every guy uses the trash.

00:15:49,757 --> 00:15:50,858
Guy had sticky fingers.

00:15:50,925 --> 00:15:52,626
Semen?

00:15:52,693 --> 00:15:54,061
Oh, yeah.

00:16:00,234 --> 00:16:02,736
Fresh eyes, new evidence.

00:17:24,718 --> 00:17:26,554
I think we're done.

00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,756
Then let's get started.

00:17:48,509 --> 00:17:50,010
What do you got?

00:17:50,077 --> 00:17:52,246
Parking placard.
"Saturn Arms."

00:17:52,313 --> 00:17:53,781
It was affixed
to the rearview mirror.

00:17:53,848 --> 00:17:54,949
It's the same kind of permit

00:17:55,015 --> 00:17:56,884
we use at my
apartment building.

00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:57,885
Hmm.

00:18:07,194 --> 00:18:08,429
White threads...

00:18:08,496 --> 00:18:09,763
It is impossible

00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:12,299
to trace the source
of a white thread.

00:18:12,366 --> 00:18:15,102
Reddish-brown stain
consistent with blood.

00:18:15,169 --> 00:18:16,504
Really?

00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:17,938
Mmm.
That could match

00:18:18,005 --> 00:18:19,774
the bloody towel
that Warrick found.

00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,575
Well, the towel is inadmissible,

00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:23,944
but the threads
are still fair game.

00:18:24,011 --> 00:18:25,946
So...

00:18:26,013 --> 00:18:29,450
you still upset about your case
being put on hold?

00:18:31,585 --> 00:18:33,687
( <i>chuckles mischievously</i> )

00:18:35,356 --> 00:18:36,390
Jacqui Franco.

00:18:36,457 --> 00:18:38,626
You responded to my page
in under 45 seconds.

00:18:38,692 --> 00:18:39,593
Gotta be a record.

00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,729
Tell me you've found
something probative.

00:18:41,796 --> 00:18:42,930
Extremely probative.

00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:45,800
Grissom lifted a print off
a beer bottle Catherine found

00:18:45,866 --> 00:18:47,101
in Rachel Lyford's trash.

00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:48,536
Print matches your suspect.

00:18:48,602 --> 00:18:49,737
Oh, wicked.

00:18:49,804 --> 00:18:52,473
You know, in the pretrial
interview, Fife denied

00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,742
ever being in the
victim's apartment.

00:18:54,809 --> 00:18:56,577
Let him try to deny
the print.

00:18:56,644 --> 00:18:58,012
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

00:18:58,078 --> 00:18:59,180
Counselor, your client's
rights...

00:18:59,246 --> 00:19:00,714
Detective, let me finish.

00:19:00,781 --> 00:19:01,916
...will not be violated.
I want it on
the record

00:19:01,982 --> 00:19:05,186
that my client has been advised
not to take this meeting.

00:19:05,252 --> 00:19:06,787
I want to hear what
they have to say.

00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:07,988
WARRICK:
Several hours ago,

00:19:08,055 --> 00:19:10,124
we found
blood-stained threads

00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:12,526
in the back
of your client's car.

00:19:12,593 --> 00:19:14,795
DNA ran the blood.

00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,964
It is consistent
with Rachel Lyford's.

00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:18,899
It is admissible into evidence.

00:19:20,801 --> 00:19:22,903
Now, what do you have to say?

00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:25,239
I don't know anything
about any threads.

00:19:25,306 --> 00:19:26,574
How well did you know
the victim?

00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,575
That's an easy one.

00:19:27,641 --> 00:19:29,677
Rachel was a neighbor.

00:19:29,743 --> 00:19:31,545
I'd say, "Hi."
"How are you?"

00:19:31,612 --> 00:19:32,546
That's it.

00:19:32,613 --> 00:19:34,181
Were you ever
in her apartment?

00:19:34,248 --> 00:19:35,516
We've been through that before.

00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:36,650
Well, we're gonna
go through it again.

00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:37,685
He's never been inside
the victim's apartment.

00:19:37,751 --> 00:19:39,587
Were you ever in her apartment?

00:19:39,653 --> 00:19:41,489
Your client's
fingerprints

00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:44,758
were on a beer bottle collected
from the victim's trash.

00:19:44,825 --> 00:19:46,227
You don't have

00:19:46,293 --> 00:19:48,229
to submit to this, Michael.
Just say the word.

00:19:48,295 --> 00:19:49,797
No, I got... I got this one.

00:19:51,298 --> 00:19:53,167
The night before Rachel
was killed,

00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:55,236
there was a party
in the courtyard...

00:19:55,302 --> 00:19:57,538
( <i>music playing,</i>
<i>people talking</i> )

00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,887
She must've taken the trash
back inside her unit.

00:20:12,953 --> 00:20:14,755
( <i>Brass laughs</i> )

00:20:14,822 --> 00:20:16,791
What do I look like, Mike?

00:20:16,857 --> 00:20:18,125
Listen to me.

00:20:18,192 --> 00:20:19,760
I don't know who killed Rachel.

00:20:19,827 --> 00:20:21,962
I don't know how that knife
got in my car.

00:20:22,029 --> 00:20:23,731
I didn't even know
my taillight was busted

00:20:23,798 --> 00:20:25,599
until that dumb-ass
cop pulled me over.

00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:29,003
I've been in jail for ten days
on something I didn't do,

00:20:29,069 --> 00:20:30,871
and I am tired of this crap!

00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,907
You might want to control
your temper, Mike.

00:20:32,973 --> 00:20:34,542
It can get you
in a lot of trouble.

00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:38,446
Detective Brass, if you were
ready to make your case,

00:20:38,512 --> 00:20:40,748
we'd be back in court,
not an interrogation room.

00:20:40,815 --> 00:20:42,917
Assuming without the knife,
you have nothing

00:20:42,983 --> 00:20:45,052
to directly connect my client
to the attack,

00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:47,955
in 12 hours, he's going to be
getting his street clothes.

00:20:52,993 --> 00:20:54,995
I'd like to speak
to Mr. Brown.

00:20:55,062 --> 00:20:56,497
I don't mind waiting.

00:20:56,564 --> 00:20:58,132
Oh, ma'am, he's at P.D.

00:20:58,199 --> 00:20:59,967
I can relay a message...

00:21:00,034 --> 00:21:01,101
That's okay.

00:21:01,168 --> 00:21:03,737
I'm just... I need
to talk to him, so...

00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:04,672
Mr. Brown.

00:21:04,738 --> 00:21:05,973
Yeah. Hi.

00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,008
I know you must be
extremely busy...

00:21:08,075 --> 00:21:10,177
but I need to know...

00:21:10,244 --> 00:21:12,346
I need you to tell me

00:21:12,413 --> 00:21:15,683
that Michael Fife
is going to pay for what he did

00:21:15,749 --> 00:21:16,684
to my sister.

00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,119
I'm doing everything I can.

00:21:18,185 --> 00:21:20,121
My mother's been medicated,

00:21:20,187 --> 00:21:22,156
and I can't sleep,
and you're, what?

00:21:22,223 --> 00:21:23,624
You're on a coffee break?

00:21:23,691 --> 00:21:26,427
Actually, it's the first
break I've had since court,

00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:29,296
so, if you'll excuse me,
I have a lot of work to do.

00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:32,833
What's going on here?!

00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,536
Does anyone even care?!

00:21:35,603 --> 00:21:37,438
Ms. Lyford? Ms. Lyford,
I'm Nick Stokes.

00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:39,340
I'm also a criminalist
here in the lab,

00:21:39,406 --> 00:21:41,208
and I want you to
know I understand.

00:21:41,275 --> 00:21:42,943
I understand
your frustration.

00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:46,013
This is not an easy thing to
deal with, but I can assure you

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,382
that this entire lab is
on your sister's case.

00:21:48,449 --> 00:21:52,286
Okay? I can't make
any promises,

00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:53,888
but we're doing
everything possible

00:21:53,954 --> 00:21:56,323
to keep this suspect behind
bars, where he belongs.

00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:59,493
Thank you.

00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,796
That's all I needed to hear.

00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:04,365
Okay.

00:22:04,431 --> 00:22:05,399
Okay.

00:22:05,466 --> 00:22:06,834
Thank you.

00:22:06,901 --> 00:22:08,435
Hang in there.

00:22:18,012 --> 00:22:19,980
What's up, Warrick?

00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,248
What's up with what?

00:22:21,315 --> 00:22:22,416
With you.

00:22:22,483 --> 00:22:23,617
This job is hard enough

00:22:23,684 --> 00:22:26,220
without having victims' families
up in your face.

00:22:26,287 --> 00:22:27,388
Her sister was raped
and murdered.

00:22:27,455 --> 00:22:28,923
She watched the defense
decimate your case.

00:22:28,989 --> 00:22:29,924
I think you could have

00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:31,091
given her five minutes.

00:22:31,158 --> 00:22:33,260
You want to hold this girl's
hand, that's fine by me.

00:22:33,327 --> 00:22:34,395
That seems to be your M.O.

00:22:34,462 --> 00:22:36,096
But when you empathize
instead of sympathize,

00:22:36,163 --> 00:22:37,097
I don't judge you.

00:22:37,164 --> 00:22:38,165
She just wants to know

00:22:38,232 --> 00:22:40,301
that someone around here
gives a damn, Warrick.

00:22:40,367 --> 00:22:42,470
You know what?
Lunch is over.

00:22:42,536 --> 00:22:44,805
Time to go back to work.

00:22:44,872 --> 00:22:46,507
( <i>kicks trash can over</i> )

00:23:09,864 --> 00:23:11,332
Hey, you.

00:23:11,398 --> 00:23:12,133
Hey.

00:23:12,199 --> 00:23:15,402
How, uh, are you holding up?

00:23:15,469 --> 00:23:17,238
I'm fine.

00:23:17,304 --> 00:23:19,406
You sure?

00:23:19,473 --> 00:23:20,741
Yeah.

00:23:20,808 --> 00:23:22,843
You're in the women's bathroom.

00:23:26,714 --> 00:23:27,715
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

00:23:27,782 --> 00:23:28,716
No, I...

00:23:28,783 --> 00:23:30,718
I'm all for it.

00:23:30,785 --> 00:23:32,153
Oh, God...
( <i>laughs</i> )

00:23:32,219 --> 00:23:34,421
Oh...

00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:40,261
This case is twisting me up.

00:23:40,327 --> 00:23:42,630
Interrogation room...

00:23:42,696 --> 00:23:44,298
was a bust.

00:23:44,365 --> 00:23:45,933
Fife can lie better
than I can tell the truth.

00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,336
Better to know his lies
before we go to trial.

00:23:49,403 --> 00:23:51,639
I don't think
it's going to trial.

00:23:51,705 --> 00:23:52,873
We've got time.

00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:56,343
Seminal DNA's being processed
as we speak.

00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:58,979
This case can break any minute.

00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:01,882
I'm not giving up.

00:24:01,949 --> 00:24:03,184
I'm just being realistic.

00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:04,552
Come on, you
know, Warrick,

00:24:04,618 --> 00:24:07,555
we don't just call these cases
RUSH 'cause we're in a hurry.

00:24:07,621 --> 00:24:09,290
It's a RUSH
'cause our pulse races,

00:24:09,356 --> 00:24:11,025
it's a rush
when we nail the guy...

00:24:12,827 --> 00:24:14,695
I like that.

00:24:15,963 --> 00:24:17,264
Oh, hey! Hey, boss!

00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,835
Yes?

00:24:20,901 --> 00:24:23,504
I Just ID'ed the substance
from Rachel Lyford's wrist.

00:24:23,571 --> 00:24:25,239
Same substance found
on the sheets.

00:24:25,306 --> 00:24:27,675
Have you told Warrick?
He's the lead on this.

00:24:27,741 --> 00:24:30,444
Yeah, about Warrick,
what exactly happened
in court today?

00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:32,513
I tried to talk to him,
he just shut down.

00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,482
He just shut you down.

00:24:34,548 --> 00:24:36,484
What is the substance?

00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:38,052
Uh... wax.

00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:39,220
What kind of wax?

00:24:39,286 --> 00:24:40,621
Uh, still
working on that,

00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:43,491
but I can tell you
that it does have a
low melting point.

00:24:43,557 --> 00:24:45,126
The GCMS doesn't
have a wax library.

00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:47,928
I've ordered up a reference
from the New Jersey state lab.

00:24:47,995 --> 00:24:48,929
RUSH.

00:24:48,996 --> 00:24:50,998
Okay.

00:24:51,065 --> 00:24:54,502
Cross-check the product labels
off the Internet.

00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:58,272
And, uh, listen, if you need
someone to talk to...

00:24:58,339 --> 00:24:59,874
Yeah, when's a good time?

00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,810
We have a psychologist here
on Tuesdays and Fridays.

00:25:11,485 --> 00:25:13,287
DNA on the toilet flusher.

00:25:13,354 --> 00:25:14,555
On the Three-Ten,

00:25:14,622 --> 00:25:16,423
we're five
seconds out.

00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:20,361
Three, two, one.

00:25:24,265 --> 00:25:25,599
Sorry.

00:25:27,701 --> 00:25:29,103
Suspect's DNA is inconsistent

00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:30,871
with the semen found
at the scene.

00:25:30,938 --> 00:25:32,006
Great.

00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:34,275
Hey, Grissom,
that sheriff's checked

00:25:34,341 --> 00:25:37,711
with just about every tech
in the lab looking for you.

00:25:37,778 --> 00:25:39,480
He's bugging for an update.

00:25:39,547 --> 00:25:40,948
I suggest
you avoid him.

00:25:41,015 --> 00:25:42,216
Why? What happened?

00:25:42,283 --> 00:25:44,785
Our only suspect
may be innocent.

00:25:48,663 --> 00:25:49,709
SIDLE:
<i>You're saying that</i>

00:25:49,776 --> 00:25:51,344
the DNA results
exclude our suspect,

00:25:51,411 --> 00:25:53,780
but couldn't the semen have come
from a prior sexual encounter

00:25:53,847 --> 00:25:55,515
with another man?
STOKES:
Fife still could

00:25:55,582 --> 00:25:56,850
have raped and murdered Rachel.

00:25:56,916 --> 00:25:58,518
WILLOWS:
Well, the toilet
bowl was clean.

00:25:58,585 --> 00:25:59,552
The semen belongs

00:25:59,619 --> 00:26:01,688
to whoever flushed
the toilet last,

00:26:01,754 --> 00:26:03,790
but there was a drop,
not a smear.

00:26:03,857 --> 00:26:05,358
GRISSOM:
Look, we have
no evidence

00:26:05,425 --> 00:26:06,960
that he raped her,
no evidence

00:26:07,026 --> 00:26:08,027
that he killed her, and even

00:26:08,094 --> 00:26:09,429
if we consider
the invisible evidence,

00:26:09,496 --> 00:26:11,531
it still doesn't give us enough
to put him at the scene

00:26:11,598 --> 00:26:13,566
of the crime during
the commission of the crime.

00:26:13,633 --> 00:26:15,068
Our trinity of evidence

00:26:15,135 --> 00:26:16,369
is incomplete.

00:26:16,436 --> 00:26:17,871
WILLOWS:
Okay, so, for
argument's sake,

00:26:17,937 --> 00:26:20,373
let's assume that Fife didn't
put the knife in the car.

00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,374
How did it get there?

00:26:21,441 --> 00:26:23,810
Okay, um, does he live alone?

00:26:23,877 --> 00:26:24,978
Yeah.

00:26:25,044 --> 00:26:26,146
Recently separated.

00:26:26,212 --> 00:26:27,714
His wife moved back
to Albuquerque.

00:26:27,781 --> 00:26:29,716
And no one else had access
to his vehicle.

00:26:29,783 --> 00:26:32,051
Was there any sign
of forced entry?

00:26:32,118 --> 00:26:33,653
No sign of
forced entry.

00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,355
And what evidence is still
outstanding?

00:26:35,421 --> 00:26:36,790
GRISSOM:
The wax.

00:26:36,856 --> 00:26:39,225
What's-his-name is still
analyzing it.

00:26:39,292 --> 00:26:40,693
WILLOWS:
Well, I know that
there was wax

00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,462
on the sheets
and the victim's body.

00:26:42,529 --> 00:26:43,997
How about the murder weapon?

00:26:44,063 --> 00:26:45,832
I didn't notice,
but I wasn't looking.

00:26:45,899 --> 00:26:47,167
STOKES:
Doesn't matter.

00:26:47,233 --> 00:26:48,401
Knife's excluded.

00:26:48,468 --> 00:26:49,736
GRISSOM:
The exclusionary rule

00:26:49,803 --> 00:26:50,937
only applies to the person

00:26:51,004 --> 00:26:52,539
whose constitutional rights
were violated.

00:26:52,605 --> 00:26:54,507
If we have another suspect,
then the knife is back

00:26:54,574 --> 00:26:56,476
in play.
Grissom?

00:26:59,312 --> 00:27:01,548
( <i>heavy sigh</i> )

00:27:03,583 --> 00:27:05,518
I'm sorry. You look lost.

00:27:05,585 --> 00:27:07,854
I've been calling your cell.

00:27:07,921 --> 00:27:09,556
Well, we get bad reception
at CSI. Listen,

00:27:09,622 --> 00:27:11,357
if this is about dinner,
I'm free next week.

00:27:11,424 --> 00:27:12,792
I'll be having the fish.

00:27:12,859 --> 00:27:14,961
We have nine hours
left on the clock, Grissom.

00:27:15,028 --> 00:27:17,530
Well, the investigation,
which is under my purview,

00:27:17,597 --> 00:27:19,199
has taken an
unexpected turn.

00:27:19,265 --> 00:27:21,468
So, when I know something,
you'll know something.

00:27:21,534 --> 00:27:23,570
I don't like surprises.

00:27:23,636 --> 00:27:25,505
Me, neither.

00:27:25,572 --> 00:27:27,507
What, you're not going
to tell me anything?

00:27:27,574 --> 00:27:29,409
No.

00:27:31,144 --> 00:27:33,146
Okay.

00:27:34,514 --> 00:27:35,615
For now.

00:27:35,682 --> 00:27:36,916
Mm-hmm.

00:28:49,055 --> 00:28:50,490
Checking my work?

00:28:50,557 --> 00:28:52,792
Oh, I'm just
looking around.

00:28:55,628 --> 00:28:57,797
What are you thinking?

00:28:57,864 --> 00:28:59,032
Well,

00:28:59,099 --> 00:29:01,968
her body left
behind this void.

00:29:02,035 --> 00:29:03,203
The attacker was on top.

00:29:03,269 --> 00:29:04,737
He held her down by her wrists.

00:29:04,804 --> 00:29:07,073
Which would explain the transfer
of wax from him to her.

00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,641
Yes.

00:29:09,709 --> 00:29:11,344
Pin me down.

00:29:16,783 --> 00:29:19,352
She would have struggled.

00:29:21,121 --> 00:29:23,890
Then, she gave up.

00:29:25,492 --> 00:29:27,727
Afterward, when he got up,

00:29:27,794 --> 00:29:30,330
he put his hands on the sheet
for leverage.

00:29:33,299 --> 00:29:35,869
Like this.

00:29:35,935 --> 00:29:39,172
Which explains how
the wax got from
him to the sheets.

00:29:39,239 --> 00:29:40,707
Yes.

00:29:41,741 --> 00:29:44,644
Grissom, um, I, um,

00:29:44,711 --> 00:29:46,246
wanted to talk to you
about something.

00:29:47,247 --> 00:29:49,215
Go ahead.

00:29:49,282 --> 00:29:51,217
Well, you know, I applied
for the promotion

00:29:51,284 --> 00:29:52,218
for the key position.

00:29:52,285 --> 00:29:53,520
Your application's on my desk.

00:29:53,586 --> 00:29:54,587
About that--

00:29:54,654 --> 00:29:56,589
I, um... I needed to know...

00:29:56,656 --> 00:29:58,558
I...

00:29:58,625 --> 00:30:01,327
I wanted to make
sure, rather, that

00:30:01,394 --> 00:30:04,097
anything that happened
or didn't happen between us

00:30:04,164 --> 00:30:05,598
won't be a factor.

00:30:08,134 --> 00:30:10,103
Never mind.

00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:12,605
I-I shouldn't have said
anything.

00:30:12,672 --> 00:30:14,207
I, um...

00:30:14,274 --> 00:30:15,542
I'm always

00:30:15,608 --> 00:30:19,279
over-talking around you.

00:30:25,018 --> 00:30:26,319
Have you ever
heard of body wax?

00:30:26,386 --> 00:30:29,589
Made with soy, burns clean.

00:30:29,656 --> 00:30:31,257
Drip it all over
your partner's body.

00:30:31,324 --> 00:30:33,259
I thought that we installed

00:30:33,326 --> 00:30:35,161
a fire-wall
for sites like these.

00:30:35,228 --> 00:30:36,830
This is research.

00:30:36,896 --> 00:30:38,832
Body wax has been eliminated.

00:30:38,898 --> 00:30:39,933
What have you got?

00:30:39,999 --> 00:30:41,000
Well,

00:30:41,067 --> 00:30:42,235
I've I.D.'d the wax.

00:30:42,302 --> 00:30:44,337
But, per Grissom,
I am not allowed

00:30:44,404 --> 00:30:46,039
to release any
of my results

00:30:46,106 --> 00:30:47,407
except to
the lead CSI,

00:30:47,474 --> 00:30:49,008
and that would
be Warrick.

00:30:49,075 --> 00:30:50,176
I've already
paged him.

00:30:50,243 --> 00:30:51,411
Give me.

00:30:54,214 --> 00:30:55,615
Axion Car Wax.

00:30:55,682 --> 00:30:58,551
Contains carnuba wax,
butyl cellusolve

00:30:58,618 --> 00:31:00,520
and cationic surfactant.

00:31:00,587 --> 00:31:02,055
Exact same ratio
as the exemplars.

00:31:02,122 --> 00:31:03,790
Ah.

00:31:03,857 --> 00:31:05,792
There's a little
souvenir for you.

00:31:05,859 --> 00:31:06,860
Thank you.

00:31:06,926 --> 00:31:08,194
GRISSOM:
<i>Axion Wax is</i>

00:31:08,261 --> 00:31:09,429
industrial grade.

00:31:09,496 --> 00:31:12,966
It's sold to car washes
for commercial use only.

00:31:13,032 --> 00:31:15,101
Yeah. Fife's an electrician.

00:31:15,168 --> 00:31:19,072
I doubt he would come
into contact with that at work.

00:31:19,139 --> 00:31:21,808
Then, we need to know
where he gets his car washed.

00:31:21,875 --> 00:31:23,743
WILLOWS:
Except, if we ask him,

00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:25,578
we show our cards,
and his lawyer will know

00:31:25,645 --> 00:31:27,313
that we're looking
in another direction.

00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:29,149
Yeah, then he'll
petition Judge Brenner

00:31:29,215 --> 00:31:31,351
for Fife's immediate release.

00:31:32,385 --> 00:31:34,621
How do you feel
about letting him walk?

00:31:34,687 --> 00:31:37,657
We've got, what,
less than seven hours.

00:31:39,659 --> 00:31:40,894
Let's not pull any punches.

00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,896
If the evidence is leading us
away from Fife,

00:31:42,962 --> 00:31:44,964
I say we go with it.

00:31:49,871 --> 00:31:51,105
<i>Mr. Fife,</i>

00:31:51,172 --> 00:31:53,007
let's establish
a sequence of events.

00:31:53,074 --> 00:31:54,976
Walk us through
the night of the party

00:31:55,043 --> 00:31:56,210
at your apartment complex

00:31:56,277 --> 00:32:00,515
right up until your
arrest the next day.

00:32:00,581 --> 00:32:02,383
Don't skip a beat.

00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:04,118
Devil's in the details, huh?

00:32:04,185 --> 00:32:05,319
Could be.

00:32:08,556 --> 00:32:11,392
I hung out until about midnight.

00:32:11,459 --> 00:32:13,227
Drank my six pack.

00:32:13,294 --> 00:32:15,263
Hit on a couple girls.

00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:17,165
Struck out.

00:32:17,231 --> 00:32:21,102
Went back to my apartment,
passed out.

00:32:21,169 --> 00:32:24,238
In the morning,
I drove up to Green Valley

00:32:24,305 --> 00:32:29,510
and installed a chandelier,
two sconces.

00:32:29,577 --> 00:32:31,946
At noon,
I went back to my apartment,

00:32:32,013 --> 00:32:34,982
and I made
a tuna fish sandwich.

00:32:35,049 --> 00:32:38,252
Lettuce, tomato,

00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:40,655
spoon of relish.

00:32:40,722 --> 00:32:41,856
Wheat bread.

00:32:41,923 --> 00:32:47,261
Then... I took a leak.

00:32:47,328 --> 00:32:49,030
I don't want to skip a beat.

00:32:49,097 --> 00:32:50,832
Outstanding.

00:32:50,898 --> 00:32:53,668
So, then what?

00:32:53,735 --> 00:32:56,304
So, I liked your
tough act yesterday.

00:32:56,371 --> 00:33:00,208
Huh?

00:33:00,274 --> 00:33:01,943
"I hand out
the assignments.

00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:04,278
This isn't
a negotiation."

00:33:04,345 --> 00:33:07,815
What, too much?

00:33:07,882 --> 00:33:09,817
Not enough.

00:33:09,884 --> 00:33:11,652
That afternoon,
I had a job

00:33:11,719 --> 00:33:12,820
in Henderson.

00:33:12,887 --> 00:33:16,424
On my way, I stopped,
uh, at a car wash.

00:33:16,491 --> 00:33:18,359
It was a lunch-hour
discount.

00:33:18,426 --> 00:33:19,460
What car wash?

00:33:19,527 --> 00:33:21,162
Reliant,
on Chardon Circle.

00:33:21,229 --> 00:33:22,897
It's about a block
from my apartment.

00:33:22,964 --> 00:33:24,732
Why are you asking
about a car wash?

00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:27,168
At Reliant, did the attendant
say anything

00:33:27,235 --> 00:33:28,836
about your broken taillight?

00:33:28,903 --> 00:33:33,041
No. Yeah, in fact, I mean,
they should've said something.

00:33:33,107 --> 00:33:35,043
The tenor of these questions
leads me to believe

00:33:35,109 --> 00:33:37,145
the focus of your investigation
has shifted.

00:33:37,211 --> 00:33:38,980
This conversation is over,
Michael.

00:33:45,386 --> 00:33:47,789
WARRICK:
<i>I just talked to the manager.</i>

00:33:47,855 --> 00:33:50,525
Of course,
he didn't recognize Fife

00:33:50,591 --> 00:33:52,827
from the six pack of photos.

00:33:52,894 --> 00:33:54,062
We're cleared to look around.

00:33:54,128 --> 00:33:55,063
By bringing your car

00:33:55,129 --> 00:33:56,497
to a car wash, you pretty much

00:33:56,564 --> 00:33:59,267
open it up
into the entire world, right?

00:33:59,334 --> 00:34:01,069
Vehicles are most vulnerable
down that tunnel.

00:34:01,135 --> 00:34:03,671
So, I'm thinking
that Michael Fife's

00:34:03,738 --> 00:34:06,507
taillight was intact
when he arrived.

00:34:06,574 --> 00:34:08,576
I'm sure the attendant
would have told him something.

00:34:08,643 --> 00:34:09,577
They're liable, right?

00:34:09,644 --> 00:34:13,114
Exactly.
So, his car proceeds

00:34:13,181 --> 00:34:16,017
on down the line,
and then inside the tunnel,

00:34:16,084 --> 00:34:18,319
someone,
presumably our killer,

00:34:18,386 --> 00:34:21,122
stashes the knife,
breaks the taillight.

00:34:21,189 --> 00:34:23,291
Busted taillight's
an equipment violation.

00:34:23,358 --> 00:34:24,993
NRS 485.511.

00:34:25,059 --> 00:34:27,628
Yeah, you'd get pulled over
for that pretty quickly.

00:34:27,695 --> 00:34:29,163
And the killer
is banking

00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:30,498
on some
ambitious cop

00:34:30,565 --> 00:34:32,300
searching the vehicle.

00:34:32,367 --> 00:34:34,802
Okay, so, a broken taillight.

00:34:34,869 --> 00:34:38,706
The pieces fall into the water.

00:34:38,773 --> 00:34:40,008
WARRICK:
The fragments
have to run off

00:34:40,074 --> 00:34:41,009
through some kind
of drain.

00:34:41,075 --> 00:34:43,611
Uh, excuse me, sir.

00:34:43,678 --> 00:34:46,681
A-Are you the manager?

00:34:46,748 --> 00:34:48,216
Yeah.

00:34:48,282 --> 00:34:50,651
Does your drain have a filter?

00:34:50,718 --> 00:34:52,620
There's a screen trap
behind the drain.

00:34:52,687 --> 00:34:55,356
Catches everything bigger
than an ice cream sprinkle.

00:34:55,423 --> 00:34:58,292
Well, when was the last time
you had it cleaned?

00:34:58,359 --> 00:34:59,794
About a month ago. Why?

00:34:59,861 --> 00:35:02,730
I'm going to have
to clean your trap.

00:35:05,066 --> 00:35:06,100
Sorry, lady.

00:35:06,167 --> 00:35:07,568
Can't just close down the shop.

00:35:07,635 --> 00:35:08,736
I got customers.

00:35:08,803 --> 00:35:10,171
I understand, sir,
but you know,

00:35:10,238 --> 00:35:12,173
just let us shut you down
for about an hour or so.

00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,741
Otherwise,
we can get a search warrant,

00:35:13,808 --> 00:35:16,177
come back on Saturday, your
busiest day, and, well...

00:35:16,244 --> 00:35:17,745
it's up to you.

00:35:17,812 --> 00:35:20,481
Soon as that Porsche Cayenne
works its way

00:35:20,548 --> 00:35:22,283
through the line...

00:35:23,751 --> 00:35:25,253
I'll shut her off.

00:35:25,319 --> 00:35:28,990
The Crime Lab
thanks you for your
cooperation, sir.

00:35:29,057 --> 00:35:30,358
You're welcome.

00:35:30,425 --> 00:35:31,959
All right, Sassy.

00:35:46,941 --> 00:35:49,210
Look what I found.

00:35:49,277 --> 00:35:52,113
A broken taillight.

00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:55,216
Hey, could two cars
get too close to each other

00:35:55,283 --> 00:35:57,151
and have an accident
in here?

00:35:57,218 --> 00:35:58,519
There's no way.

00:35:58,586 --> 00:35:59,821
Photocell technology.

00:35:59,887 --> 00:36:02,190
Whole system shuts
down if the cars get

00:36:02,256 --> 00:36:03,891
within three feet
of each other.

00:36:03,958 --> 00:36:05,893
Believe me,
in this tunnel,

00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,528
accidents do not happen.

00:36:07,595 --> 00:36:09,197
Which means the taillight

00:36:09,263 --> 00:36:10,732
was broken on purpose.

00:36:13,868 --> 00:36:16,604
Okay, uh, thank you,
thanks for coming down here

00:36:16,671 --> 00:36:19,607
and volunteering
to give a DNA sample.

00:36:19,674 --> 00:36:21,976
We know you work hard,
so, in an effort to be nice,

00:36:22,043 --> 00:36:23,745
we've provided some lunch,
some burgers and stuff,

00:36:23,811 --> 00:36:26,247
compliments of the Las Vegas
Police Department.

00:36:26,314 --> 00:36:27,448
Okay, let's form
two lines now.

00:36:27,515 --> 00:36:29,417
Everybody
whose birthday

00:36:29,484 --> 00:36:30,718
is from January
to June

00:36:30,785 --> 00:36:32,987
in this line,
everybody else over here.

00:36:33,054 --> 00:36:35,957
How long is this crap
going to take?

00:36:36,024 --> 00:36:38,059
As long as it takes, okay?

00:36:38,126 --> 00:36:39,727
Thank you.

00:36:39,794 --> 00:36:41,496
All right,
you guys,

00:36:41,562 --> 00:36:44,065
I'm going to be swabbing
your left cheek,

00:36:44,132 --> 00:36:46,067
so, uh...
try not to bite down.

00:36:47,502 --> 00:36:50,972
Uh, ma'am, I got
to take a leak.

00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:52,373
Well, you just hold on there.

00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,008
It's only going
to take a second.

00:36:55,176 --> 00:36:56,411
Open.

00:37:02,316 --> 00:37:04,018
Thank you.

00:37:10,758 --> 00:37:11,959
Uh, Akers,

00:37:12,026 --> 00:37:15,330
do me a favor and escort
this guy to the john.

00:37:15,396 --> 00:37:16,531
Let's go.

00:37:16,597 --> 00:37:18,266
( <i>clearing throat</i> )

00:37:24,906 --> 00:37:27,775
MAN:
<i>You guys are making</i>
<i>a big mistake.</i>

00:37:27,842 --> 00:37:30,912
I don't know a Rachel Lyford,
I swear.

00:37:30,978 --> 00:37:32,613
Really?
Well, I swear

00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,048
that you do.

00:37:34,115 --> 00:37:37,485
I found semen on the toilet
in Rachel's apartment

00:37:37,552 --> 00:37:38,786
that matches
your DNA.

00:37:38,853 --> 00:37:40,421
You don't have to respond,

00:37:40,488 --> 00:37:42,724
but if you can explain
the semen...

00:37:44,926 --> 00:37:46,094
I know a Rachel, okay?

00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,628
I never knew her last name.

00:37:47,695 --> 00:37:49,964
Did the girl
that you guys are looking for

00:37:50,031 --> 00:37:52,066
live at the Saturn
Arms apartments?

00:37:52,133 --> 00:37:53,234
So, you do know her.

00:37:53,301 --> 00:37:56,304
I... here's the deal, okay?

00:37:56,371 --> 00:37:59,140
A car wax costs
60 bucks, okay?

00:37:59,207 --> 00:38:00,441
We give you
discounts sometimes.

00:38:00,508 --> 00:38:01,809
I'll show up early
and, you know,

00:38:01,876 --> 00:38:03,978
I'll go to a girl's
apartment before work,

00:38:04,045 --> 00:38:06,881
or whatever, you know,
and all the guys do this.

00:38:06,948 --> 00:38:09,851
So, Rachel hired you
to wax her car, is that it?

00:38:09,917 --> 00:38:12,286
I only charged her 25.

00:38:12,353 --> 00:38:14,422
( <i>laughing</i> )

00:38:14,489 --> 00:38:16,524
Hi.

00:38:16,591 --> 00:38:18,026
Shiny as a new penny.

00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,329
( <i>laughing</i> )

00:38:21,396 --> 00:38:25,466
And your story
is that Rachel came on to you?

00:38:25,533 --> 00:38:27,602
Yeah. She was all over me.

00:38:27,669 --> 00:38:29,337
She answered the door

00:38:29,404 --> 00:38:31,139
in, like, this sexy
little thing, and stuff.

00:38:31,205 --> 00:38:33,141
Most of the time,
when a woman answers the door,

00:38:33,207 --> 00:38:34,842
it's in sweats,
they got the money ready.

00:38:34,909 --> 00:38:36,010
This was not
like that.

00:38:36,077 --> 00:38:38,279
( <i>laughing</i> ):
What am I supposed to think?

00:38:38,346 --> 00:38:39,547
I don't think so.

00:38:41,482 --> 00:38:44,686
Hey, I'm all done.

00:38:46,154 --> 00:38:48,289
Uh, hold on a second.

00:38:51,926 --> 00:38:54,662
Okay, here you go.

00:38:55,797 --> 00:38:57,732
( <i>screaming</i> )

00:38:57,799 --> 00:38:58,733
Stop it! Stop it!

00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,401
( <i>screaming</i> )

00:39:00,468 --> 00:39:04,038
After raping her, you realized
she had your name,

00:39:04,105 --> 00:39:05,373
knew where
you worked.

00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,607
One call
to the cops

00:39:06,674 --> 00:39:10,144
and you're looking
at 25 to life.

00:39:10,211 --> 00:39:13,348
( <i>terrified moaning</i> )

00:39:19,187 --> 00:39:21,656
You freaked.

00:39:21,723 --> 00:39:23,157
So, you killed her.

00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:30,865
( <i>screaming</i> )

00:39:41,042 --> 00:39:44,012
Forget life; you're looking
at the death penalty.

00:39:44,078 --> 00:39:45,646
Lady, you are whacked.

00:39:45,713 --> 00:39:47,849
You didn't find

00:39:47,915 --> 00:39:50,084
the murder weapon
in my client's car.

00:39:50,151 --> 00:39:52,787
Your client
went from Rachel's apartment

00:39:52,854 --> 00:39:54,689
to his job at the car wash.

00:39:54,756 --> 00:39:56,457
He took the knife
with him.

00:39:56,524 --> 00:39:59,193
A few hours later,
Michael Fife drove in,

00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:02,063
and he planted the knife
in his car.

00:40:09,137 --> 00:40:10,972
He just happened
to hide the murder weapon

00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:13,374
in a car that belonged
to one of Rachel's neighbors?

00:40:13,441 --> 00:40:14,542
It wasn't a coincidence.

00:40:14,609 --> 00:40:15,610
It was your lucky day.

00:40:15,677 --> 00:40:17,211
You recognized
the parking permit

00:40:17,278 --> 00:40:19,013
in his car window.

00:40:21,949 --> 00:40:24,152
You broke
the taillight,

00:40:24,218 --> 00:40:25,887
you stashed the knife.

00:40:25,953 --> 00:40:28,222
Instant suspect.

00:40:33,294 --> 00:40:34,729
You recognize these?

00:40:37,765 --> 00:40:42,203
The name on the dog tags
is Aaron Lyford.

00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:44,605
That's Rachel's father.

00:40:48,176 --> 00:40:50,311
She gave them to me.

00:40:50,378 --> 00:40:52,013
She gave them to you.

00:40:53,881 --> 00:40:55,083
Why did you try to hide them?

00:40:55,149 --> 00:40:56,684
<i>Why did you take off</i>
<i>to the bathroom</i>

00:40:56,751 --> 00:40:57,685
<i>with the dog tags on?</i>

00:40:57,752 --> 00:40:59,087
<i>And you came back</i>

00:40:59,153 --> 00:41:00,121
<i>with them missing.</i>

00:41:00,188 --> 00:41:01,222
<i>So, I checked it out.</i>

00:41:14,569 --> 00:41:16,270
This is an autopsy photo.

00:41:18,673 --> 00:41:20,942
The abrasions are evidence.

00:41:21,009 --> 00:41:23,811
Those dog tags
were ripped from her neck.

00:41:30,184 --> 00:41:34,622
She gave them to you...
over her dead body.

00:41:38,026 --> 00:41:40,461
The defendant
arrived at the station

00:41:40,528 --> 00:41:41,963
on his own accord.

00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:43,931
He provided us with a sample
of his DNA,

00:41:43,998 --> 00:41:46,300
and we rushed that sample
to our lab for analysis.

00:41:46,367 --> 00:41:48,369
You compared Mr. Quinn's DNA

00:41:48,436 --> 00:41:50,905
to DNA from semen
recovered at
the crime scene,

00:41:50,972 --> 00:41:52,540
is that correct?

00:41:52,607 --> 00:41:53,675
Yes, that's correct.

00:41:53,741 --> 00:41:55,009
It was a match.

00:41:55,076 --> 00:41:57,612
CHIEF DEPUTY D.A.:
Judge, we have no
further questions.

00:41:59,947 --> 00:42:01,049
Ms. Finn?

00:42:01,115 --> 00:42:05,219
Your Honor, we have no questions
for CSI Brown.

00:42:05,286 --> 00:42:07,088
JUDGE BRENNER:
Based on
the evidence,

00:42:07,155 --> 00:42:11,259
I find sufficient
probable cause

00:42:11,326 --> 00:42:14,228
to order the defendant
to stand trial

00:42:14,295 --> 00:42:16,064
for the sexual assault

00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:17,632
and murder of
Rachel Lyford.

00:42:17,699 --> 00:42:20,368
( <i>pounds gavel</i> )

00:42:37,418 --> 00:42:39,287
I'm terribly sorry
for your loss.

00:42:39,354 --> 00:42:41,155
And your father's tags

00:42:41,222 --> 00:42:43,091
are in a safe place.

00:42:43,157 --> 00:42:45,093
I'll make sure
they get back to you.

00:42:45,159 --> 00:42:46,527
Thank you for everything.

00:42:46,594 --> 00:42:48,663
You're more than welcome.

00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:50,665
ATWATER:
Hey, sorry I'm late.

00:42:50,732 --> 00:42:52,433
GRISSOM:
Well, I think
you're right on time.

00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:55,203
There must be
a press conference nearby, huh?

00:42:55,269 --> 00:42:56,337
( <i>clearing throat</i> )

00:42:56,404 --> 00:42:58,539
I wanted to include CSI Brown
in this.

00:42:58,606 --> 00:43:01,142
There might be a few questions
outside my...

00:43:01,209 --> 00:43:02,510
Purview?

00:43:02,577 --> 00:43:05,847
Want to meet me
out in the corridor ASAP?

00:43:05,913 --> 00:43:08,549
Sheriff, I'm not too good

00:43:08,616 --> 00:43:09,984
with cameras.

00:43:10,051 --> 00:43:11,686
You won't have to talk much.

00:43:11,753 --> 00:43:14,122
Grissom, thanks.

00:43:14,188 --> 00:43:15,456
For what?

00:43:15,523 --> 00:43:18,059
See you back at the lab.
