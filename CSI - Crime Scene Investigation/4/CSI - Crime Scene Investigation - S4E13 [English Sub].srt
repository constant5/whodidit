00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:08,197
MAN:
People say
that Las Vegas has no culture,

00:00:08,263 --> 00:00:09,631
no history--

00:00:09,698 --> 00:00:14,136
that we emulate, not create.

00:00:14,203 --> 00:00:17,873
They forget
that this was once a desert

00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,577
from which this city
was created.

00:00:21,643 --> 00:00:24,046
Millions come
every week

00:00:24,113 --> 00:00:26,115
and share their money with us.

00:00:26,181 --> 00:00:29,084
Well, tonight, we give back.

00:00:29,151 --> 00:00:31,086
An exhibition of rare

00:00:31,153 --> 00:00:34,823
and valuable
Japanese antiquities.

00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:37,693
Shown in the US
for the first time,

00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,896
this 17th century
samurai collection

00:00:40,963 --> 00:00:43,399
is owned by one
of the Mediterranean's

00:00:43,465 --> 00:00:44,767
most special guests,

00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:47,536
Mr. Yuri Yamamoto,

00:00:47,603 --> 00:00:50,472
who sadly can't be here
with us tonight.

00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:53,208
To his impeccable taste.

00:00:53,275 --> 00:00:55,644
On behalf of my hotel

00:00:55,711 --> 00:00:58,080
and the city of Las Vegas,

00:00:58,147 --> 00:01:00,115
I thank him.

00:01:00,182 --> 00:01:02,851
( <i>cheering and applause</i> )

00:01:07,055 --> 00:01:08,323
( <i>woman screaming</i> )

00:01:09,091 --> 00:01:10,059
( <i>screaming</i> )

00:01:10,726 --> 00:01:11,794
The cable fell.

00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,896
He was electrocuted.

00:01:13,962 --> 00:01:15,064
Oh, my God.

00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:16,031
( <i>cries</i> )

00:01:16,098 --> 00:01:16,932
Excuse me.

00:01:16,999 --> 00:01:17,900
Okay, folks.

00:01:18,534 --> 00:01:19,802
I need everyone to stay back.

00:01:19,868 --> 00:01:22,071
There's a live wire
in the pool, okay?

00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:26,775
( <i>electrical crackling</i> )

00:01:32,781 --> 00:01:35,317
Watch yourself, Gil.

00:01:43,392 --> 00:01:44,893
GRISSOM:
This is odd.

00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,463
Arms and legs become deadweight
in the water.

00:01:47,529 --> 00:01:50,199
He should have sunk
to the bottom of the pool.

00:01:50,265 --> 00:01:52,134
He wouldn't float
until after putrefaction.

00:01:52,201 --> 00:01:53,569
Sara, would you see

00:01:53,635 --> 00:01:55,404
where the source
of that cable is?

00:01:55,471 --> 00:01:57,039
Yeah.

00:02:16,658 --> 00:02:18,894
Found the power source.

00:02:18,961 --> 00:02:20,095
Car battery.

00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:37,546
This is not a crime scene.

00:02:37,613 --> 00:02:40,749
( <i>alarms blaring</i> )

00:02:55,264 --> 00:02:56,865
This is a crime scene.

( <i>alarms blaring</i> )

00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,775
Keep these people out.

00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:39,777
And turn that damn thing off,
will you?

00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:41,078
They only took the one piece.

00:03:41,145 --> 00:03:43,447
Samurai sword, 17th century.

00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:45,416
They say how much
it was worth?

00:03:45,483 --> 00:03:47,685
Worth the risk
of walking past 100 guests

00:03:47,752 --> 00:03:48,853
into a guarded room.

00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,888
( <i>alarms stop</i> )

00:03:50,955 --> 00:03:52,723
Hey, buddy,

00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:53,891
you see anything?

00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:55,092
No. I got hit
from nowhere.

00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:56,661
Next thing I know,
I'm taped up.

00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:59,330
Blood smear on the desk.

00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:04,168
( <i>groans</i> )

00:04:04,235 --> 00:04:06,871
I feel like an idiot.

00:04:06,938 --> 00:04:09,106
Well, you may have a concussion.

00:04:09,173 --> 00:04:10,775
Let's get you checked out.

00:04:10,841 --> 00:04:12,109
Paramedics out there?

00:04:12,176 --> 00:04:14,045
Check him up.

00:04:30,628 --> 00:04:33,130
Well, none of my men saw
anyone suspicious enter

00:04:33,197 --> 00:04:34,966
or exit.

00:04:35,032 --> 00:04:36,133
The surveillance
cameras?

00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,302
Our cameras only watch
the money and the exits.

00:04:38,369 --> 00:04:39,303
Not rooms like these.

00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:40,938
Damn, they got
the sword.

00:04:41,005 --> 00:04:42,306
Most expensive piece

00:04:42,373 --> 00:04:43,474
in the collection.

00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:45,409
This is all
Mr. Caulfield needs right now.

00:04:46,544 --> 00:04:47,645
Why is that?

00:04:47,712 --> 00:04:48,980
9/11,

00:04:49,046 --> 00:04:50,448
the depressed Asian economy,

00:04:50,514 --> 00:04:52,250
Indian gaming in California.

00:04:52,316 --> 00:04:54,252
Every casino
on the Strip's taken a hit.

00:04:54,318 --> 00:04:56,020
I'm going to
want to talk

00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:58,322
to the girl who
found the body.

00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:07,064
Smells sweet.

00:05:07,131 --> 00:05:08,833
The sign over there says

00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,768
no food or drink
in this room, right?

00:05:10,835 --> 00:05:12,970
Make sure you take it back
to Greg.

00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:31,589
My third time

00:05:31,656 --> 00:05:32,957
at this address.

00:05:33,024 --> 00:05:35,860
Two suicides a few years ago,
and now a 419.

00:05:35,927 --> 00:05:37,228
This house is cursed.

00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:38,429
You don't strike me

00:05:38,496 --> 00:05:40,598
as the type
who believes in curses.

00:05:40,665 --> 00:05:41,832
Yeah, well, I'm not the type

00:05:41,899 --> 00:05:43,401
to believe
in coincidences, either.

00:05:43,467 --> 00:05:45,336
Is this house abandoned?

00:05:45,403 --> 00:05:46,971
Bank foreclosed four years ago.

00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:48,206
Been vacant ever since.

00:05:48,272 --> 00:05:49,507
Neighbor heard a scream.

00:05:49,574 --> 00:05:51,609
I was the responding officer.

00:05:53,711 --> 00:05:55,713
( <i>garbled radio transmission</i> )

00:05:57,415 --> 00:05:59,383
( <i>door creaking</i> )

00:06:01,452 --> 00:06:02,720
Uh...

00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:26,911
Oh, hey, David.

00:06:26,978 --> 00:06:28,112
Yeah.

00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:29,113
Oh, hey.

00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,114
Uh, jugular's

00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,415
been punctured.

00:06:31,482 --> 00:06:32,617
Two marks.

00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:35,453
Possibly bite marks.

00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,189
Bite marks?

00:06:38,256 --> 00:06:40,758
Punctures are
32 millimeters apart.

00:06:40,825 --> 00:06:42,894
That's the average distance
between the eyeteeth

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,795
in an adult
male's mouth.

00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:47,064
Right, but
those punctures aren't

00:06:47,131 --> 00:06:48,533
consistent
with human teeth.

00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:49,734
Yeah, well,

00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,802
what about fangs?

00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:53,237
Fangs?

00:06:53,304 --> 00:06:54,438
Come on.

00:07:02,947 --> 00:07:04,382
Wounds are deep.

00:07:04,448 --> 00:07:05,583
She bled out.

00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:07,618
Then where's all the blood?

00:07:07,685 --> 00:07:09,487
Lividity tells me she wasn't

00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:12,557
moved postmortem,
so, I don't know.

00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:17,528
I'm going to take a look around.

00:07:17,595 --> 00:07:19,230
WILLOWS:
David, I don't know

00:07:19,297 --> 00:07:20,798
a whole lot about vampires,

00:07:20,865 --> 00:07:21,933
but if she was bit,

00:07:21,999 --> 00:07:22,934
there's spit,

00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,368
and if there's spit,
there's DNA,

00:07:24,435 --> 00:07:25,937
so swab the neck.

00:07:26,003 --> 00:07:27,305
BROWN:
Catherine,

00:07:27,371 --> 00:07:30,174
take a look at this.

00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:42,987
Please tell me
that's not blood.

00:08:00,638 --> 00:08:02,306
Negative.

00:08:02,373 --> 00:08:03,407
It's probably just

00:08:03,474 --> 00:08:04,408
house paint.

00:08:04,475 --> 00:08:06,677
Well, we know one
thing for sure.

00:08:06,744 --> 00:08:09,413
This place wasn't vacant.

00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,315
Come on, nobody should have
been allowed to leave.

00:08:11,382 --> 00:08:12,583
Your officers
didn't say anything

00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,986
about detaining Mr.
Caulfield's guests.

00:08:15,052 --> 00:08:16,988
Just give me a list
of names, okay?

00:08:17,054 --> 00:08:18,689
Yeah.

00:08:18,756 --> 00:08:19,924
Weird night.

00:08:19,991 --> 00:08:21,592
That's not the only dummy here.

00:08:21,659 --> 00:08:24,161
Yeah, it's a CPR
demonstration dummy.

00:08:24,228 --> 00:08:25,463
Fully articulated.

00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:26,631
Oh, yeah?

00:08:26,697 --> 00:08:28,432
Yeah. You know,
paramedics, firemen--

00:08:28,499 --> 00:08:30,935
they use these things
to teach lifesaving techniques.

00:08:31,002 --> 00:08:32,169
Any prints?

00:08:32,236 --> 00:08:33,571
Oh, no, no, no.

00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,540
Been in the water
way too long, man. Sorry.

00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:41,746
David says you found evidence
of vampires in North Las Vegas.

00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:44,515
Well, let's just say evidence
at the crime scene suggests

00:08:44,582 --> 00:08:46,584
occult, ritualistic activity.

00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:48,119
I'm not sure
what we found.

00:08:48,185 --> 00:08:49,253
Did you ID the vic?

00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,957
Angela Sommerville, 20,
from Henderson, Nevada.

00:08:53,024 --> 00:08:54,525
License was in her pocket.

00:08:54,592 --> 00:08:56,627
Cause of death:
exsanguination.

00:08:56,694 --> 00:08:57,962
You check out her fangs?

00:08:58,029 --> 00:09:01,165
Well, her bark was worse
than her bite.

00:09:02,967 --> 00:09:04,302
There we go.

00:09:06,537 --> 00:09:08,906
Ah. They're acrylic.

00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:12,109
Check out
her gum line.

00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:16,881
Thin grooves carved
into the canine's enamel.

00:09:16,948 --> 00:09:18,416
Fangs are clip-ons.

00:09:18,482 --> 00:09:19,417
Multiple bite marks

00:09:19,483 --> 00:09:20,885
on the tongue suggest
she was still

00:09:20,952 --> 00:09:22,086
breaking them in.

00:09:22,153 --> 00:09:24,055
Warrick, the symbol

00:09:24,121 --> 00:09:25,423
on her ankle--
it's similar

00:09:25,489 --> 00:09:26,791
to the one that
was painted

00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:28,359
on the floor of
the crime scene.

00:09:28,426 --> 00:09:29,994
BROWN:
The ankh.

00:09:30,061 --> 00:09:31,863
Egyptian symbol
for eternal life.

00:09:31,929 --> 00:09:33,464
I went on-line and found out

00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:36,534
it's also the universal
insignia for vampires.

00:09:36,601 --> 00:09:38,502
Dracula didn't drink
all her blood.

00:09:38,569 --> 00:09:40,338
I sent a sample to tox.

00:09:40,404 --> 00:09:42,340
I'm not sure if it's probative.

00:09:42,406 --> 00:09:44,075
Multiple incised wounds

00:09:44,141 --> 00:09:46,577
on the anterior
of both shoulders.

00:09:46,644 --> 00:09:47,745
Some are fresh.

00:09:47,812 --> 00:09:50,648
Well, the shoulder area
is rich in blood, right?

00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:51,916
Heals quickly.
Yeah.

00:09:51,983 --> 00:09:54,085
Relevance?

00:09:54,151 --> 00:09:55,953
I figure, if you're going
to drink someone's blood,

00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:56,988
it's a good place to start.

00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:58,923
Then why switch to the jugular?

00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,335
Hey.

00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,304
Got anything?

00:10:13,371 --> 00:10:14,839
A partial thumb, perhaps,

00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:16,941
on the tape
that was used to cover

00:10:17,008 --> 00:10:18,609
the security guard's mouth.

00:10:18,676 --> 00:10:20,545
Not torn, either.

00:10:20,611 --> 00:10:21,546
Both ends were cut.

00:10:21,612 --> 00:10:22,680
Pre-cut,

00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:23,681
in fact.

00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:24,882
Indicates planning.

00:10:24,949 --> 00:10:25,917
How about you?

00:10:25,983 --> 00:10:27,018
Trace analyzed
the liquid

00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:29,053
we found near the suit
of armor: glucose syrup.

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,355
Sugar water.

00:10:32,557 --> 00:10:36,294
Why just the sword?

00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,062
Well, it is the one piece
from the exhibit

00:10:38,129 --> 00:10:39,363
you could hide on your person.

00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,598
Down a pant leg, maybe, or...

00:10:40,665 --> 00:10:42,700
Yeah, but if you're going
to steal from a casino,

00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,101
why take an antique?

00:10:44,168 --> 00:10:45,970
Why not take cash?

00:10:46,037 --> 00:10:47,505
Good point.

00:10:50,174 --> 00:10:51,876
How's your knowledge
of Japanese history,

00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:53,077
particularly, antiquities?

00:10:53,144 --> 00:10:55,880
Not good. Why?

00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:57,615
To find the hunter...

00:10:57,682 --> 00:10:59,650
know the game.

00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:10,493
Angela was
the sweetest child.

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,763
She actually liked
spending time with us.

00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:16,165
Her friends were always
over here, and then...

00:11:16,917 --> 00:11:18,752
...puberty hit
and everything changed.

00:11:18,819 --> 00:11:20,921
She shaved her head,
then she grew dreads.

00:11:20,988 --> 00:11:22,589
It was like
she couldn't get comfortable

00:11:22,656 --> 00:11:23,957
in her own skin.

00:11:25,592 --> 00:11:26,693
About, um,

00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,096
six months ago,
Angela went Goth.

00:11:29,163 --> 00:11:30,097
Black clothing.

00:11:30,164 --> 00:11:31,365
She only went out at night.

00:11:31,431 --> 00:11:34,434
We tried to support
Angela the best we could.

00:11:34,501 --> 00:11:37,771
We only wanted
her to be happy.

00:11:37,838 --> 00:11:41,275
<i>"The Black Veil:</i>
<i>13 Rules of Community."</i>

00:11:41,341 --> 00:11:43,710
MRS. SOMMERVILLE:
Guidelines for vampires.

00:11:43,777 --> 00:11:45,345
She wrote them
down in there,

00:11:45,412 --> 00:11:46,980
along with all
her thoughts.

00:11:47,047 --> 00:11:48,816
So you've read what's in here?

00:11:52,186 --> 00:11:56,190
Your daughter believed
that she was a vampire?

00:11:56,256 --> 00:11:57,357
She was 18.

00:11:57,424 --> 00:11:59,960
She wanted to stand out,

00:12:00,027 --> 00:12:01,061
to be special.

00:12:01,128 --> 00:12:02,229
I tried
not to judge her,

00:12:02,296 --> 00:12:04,231
But I also wanted to
know what was going on

00:12:04,298 --> 00:12:04,998
in her head.

00:12:05,065 --> 00:12:05,999
She snooped.

00:12:06,066 --> 00:12:08,168
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:12:08,235 --> 00:12:09,903
Each time Angela
tried something new,

00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,472
I would take
a crash course.

00:12:11,538 --> 00:12:13,841
Lab results.

00:12:13,907 --> 00:12:14,842
Angela's HIV test.

00:12:14,908 --> 00:12:15,843
It was negative.

00:12:15,909 --> 00:12:17,511
That was the one thing

00:12:17,578 --> 00:12:19,880
we insisted upon,
not that it matters now.

00:12:26,153 --> 00:12:27,955
Who's the guy?

00:12:29,423 --> 00:12:31,425
Angela wouldn't say.

00:12:31,492 --> 00:12:34,061
The statue's an incubus.

00:12:34,127 --> 00:12:35,896
According to the legend,

00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:39,266
incubi seduce young women
while they sleep...

00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:41,468
and drink their blood.

00:12:42,503 --> 00:12:44,705
Well, your
daughter was found

00:12:44,771 --> 00:12:46,540
in an abandoned house.

00:12:46,607 --> 00:12:48,542
And we believe
that there was, um,

00:12:48,609 --> 00:12:49,543
someone there with her.

00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:51,211
Do you have any idea
who that might be?

00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:53,180
Her court.
I can give you their names.

00:12:53,247 --> 00:12:55,082
Her court?

00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:59,586
It's like a coven
for vampires.

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,561
Don't tell me,

00:13:07,628 --> 00:13:09,229
they came back
and stole the rest?

00:13:09,296 --> 00:13:11,064
No, not quite.

00:13:11,131 --> 00:13:12,332
At Mr. Yamamoto's request,

00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,535
the collection's been moved
to Mr. Caulfield's

00:13:14,601 --> 00:13:15,736
office vault.

00:13:15,802 --> 00:13:17,037
He was pretty upset.

00:13:17,104 --> 00:13:18,739
He's on his way here now
from Tokyo.

00:13:18,806 --> 00:13:20,874
We were hoping to take a look
at the rest of the exhibit.

00:13:20,941 --> 00:13:23,110
Mr. Caulfield's vault
is off limits.

00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,112
Okay, what about photographs?

00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,413
You're in luck there.

00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,614
Our hotel registrar

00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:29,616
took Polaroids
of the collection

00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:30,551
when she logged it in.

00:13:30,617 --> 00:13:31,485
Can we talk to her?

00:13:31,552 --> 00:13:33,821
Well, Miss Green
is on vacation,

00:13:33,887 --> 00:13:35,522
but, uh, I can try
and contact her.

00:13:35,589 --> 00:13:38,125
Well, this is just
a list of inventory.

00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,827
How about the
insurance policy?

00:13:39,893 --> 00:13:41,762
Yamamoto carried
his own insurance.

00:13:41,829 --> 00:13:44,064
Our hotel registrar
just documents

00:13:44,131 --> 00:13:45,966
the condition
of each piece.

00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:48,101
We extended Mr. Yamamoto
every courtesy,

00:13:48,168 --> 00:13:50,437
but weren't going
to assume responsibility.

00:13:50,504 --> 00:13:52,739
We're a casino,

00:13:52,806 --> 00:13:55,008
not a museum.

00:13:55,075 --> 00:13:56,076
Alice,

00:13:56,143 --> 00:13:57,744
you need to answer
the question.

00:13:57,811 --> 00:13:59,613
GIRL:
She won't respond
to that name.

00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,448
She goes by Luminessa.

00:14:01,515 --> 00:14:04,418
Okay, let's start over.

00:14:04,485 --> 00:14:06,186
Do any of you ladies

00:14:06,253 --> 00:14:08,655
recognize this man?

00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:11,091
BROWN:
When was the last time

00:14:11,158 --> 00:14:12,426
you saw Angela?

00:14:12,493 --> 00:14:13,260
Who?

00:14:13,327 --> 00:14:14,761
( <i>chuckles</i> ):
Okay.

00:14:14,828 --> 00:14:17,064
All right, I've had enough.

00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,298
( <i>clears throat</i> )

00:14:18,365 --> 00:14:19,800
Your friend is dead.

00:14:19,867 --> 00:14:20,801
This is a murder case.

00:14:20,868 --> 00:14:22,336
If you're not willing
to help us,

00:14:22,402 --> 00:14:25,172
we will split you up
and treat you as suspects.

00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,540
Hold you for 24 hours.

00:14:26,607 --> 00:14:27,975
Is that what you want?

00:14:31,445 --> 00:14:34,348
We called her Daegonna.

00:14:34,414 --> 00:14:35,749
We were together

00:14:35,816 --> 00:14:36,783
last night.

00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:38,352
At court.

00:14:38,418 --> 00:14:41,755
Being a vampire
is about feeding.

00:14:41,822 --> 00:14:44,358
This is pathetic.

00:14:44,424 --> 00:14:47,361
Angela had been going
to this blood bar.

00:14:47,427 --> 00:14:49,062
Wanted us to join her.

00:14:49,129 --> 00:14:50,164
Blood bar?

00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:53,433
The people who go there,
they drink blood.

00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,601
For real.

00:14:54,668 --> 00:14:55,869
Hardcore.

00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:58,472
And I guess you girls
don't do that?

00:14:58,539 --> 00:14:59,706
Hell, no.

00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:01,508
And that's what we told her.

00:15:01,575 --> 00:15:03,377
She totally lost it.

00:15:03,443 --> 00:15:05,479
She called us "gajas."

00:15:05,546 --> 00:15:07,614
Which is...?

00:15:07,681 --> 00:15:08,715
A fashion vampire.

00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:09,783
Normal people

00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:10,884
who just play dress-up.

00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,586
You don't have
to drink blood

00:15:12,653 --> 00:15:13,987
to be a vampire.

00:15:14,054 --> 00:15:15,756
For us, it's spiritual.

00:15:15,823 --> 00:15:18,091
We feed off
each other's energies.

00:15:18,158 --> 00:15:19,126
Yeah.

00:15:19,193 --> 00:15:20,594
Energy.

00:15:20,661 --> 00:15:22,763
So, we voted her invisible.

00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:25,065
Kicked her out of our court.

00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:27,067
But she wouldn't leave.

00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:29,369
So we did.

00:15:29,436 --> 00:15:31,738
And that's the last time
we saw her.

00:15:37,177 --> 00:15:39,046
SIDLE:
<i>Other items in the exhibit</i>

00:15:39,112 --> 00:15:41,448
include a 17th century

00:15:41,515 --> 00:15:42,749
decorated silk.

00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:43,851
( <i>paper shuffling</i> )

00:15:43,917 --> 00:15:45,719
17th century iron war mask.

( <i>paper shuffling</i> )

00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:49,223
17th century Kabuki robe

00:15:49,289 --> 00:15:52,793
used in the first
Kabuki dances in Kyoto.

00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,762
GRISSOM:
17th century suit of armor.

00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:01,802
Wasn't the Japanese military
established long after that?

00:16:01,869 --> 00:16:03,937
Let's see.

00:16:07,307 --> 00:16:10,511
( <i>metallic rattling</i> )

00:16:11,545 --> 00:16:16,884
1868, by Emperor Maji? Meiji.

00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:18,485
So, this is out of place.

00:16:18,552 --> 00:16:20,821
Just like the sugar water
we found nearby.

00:16:20,888 --> 00:16:23,123
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

00:16:26,627 --> 00:16:27,661
Grissom.

00:16:27,728 --> 00:16:28,896
STOKES:
Grissom, I got a hit

00:16:28,962 --> 00:16:32,466
on your partial print from
the hotel employee database.

00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:33,734
Brandon Miller.

00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,103
He's your duct-taped
security guard.

00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:37,805
GRISSOM:
I thought he was unconscious.

00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:39,940
How does his prints
end up on the tape?

00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,377
All right. Thanks, Nick.

00:16:47,981 --> 00:16:49,950
Sara?

00:16:50,017 --> 00:16:50,951
Hmm?

00:16:51,018 --> 00:16:53,854
Do you have any duct tape
in your kit?

00:16:53,921 --> 00:16:54,955
Yeah, it's what I use

00:16:55,022 --> 00:16:56,490
to keep it together.

00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:05,766
Thank you.

00:17:20,647 --> 00:17:22,449
He taped himself up.

00:17:22,516 --> 00:17:24,985
We've been conned.

00:17:25,052 --> 00:17:27,554
Well, you saw the paramedics
take him out of here.

00:17:27,621 --> 00:17:28,989
If he'd had a samurai sword

00:17:29,056 --> 00:17:31,425
hanging out of his pant
leg, you would've noticed.

00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:36,763
( <i>metallic rattling</i> )

00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:40,767
( <i>rattling continues</i> )

00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:47,608
( <i>rattling continues</i> )

00:18:06,093 --> 00:18:08,028
Huh.

00:18:08,095 --> 00:18:10,898
<i>Domo arigato.</i>

00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:13,367
So Brandon Miller
never made it to
the hospital, huh?

00:18:13,433 --> 00:18:14,868
Concussion,
my happy ass.

00:18:14,935 --> 00:18:16,036
It's an old trick.

00:18:16,103 --> 00:18:18,071
Don't steal the item;
just leave it at the location,

00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:19,673
come back and get it
when the cops leave.

00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:20,941
Well, your timing's perfect.

00:18:21,008 --> 00:18:22,142
Mr. Yamamoto just arrived.

00:18:22,209 --> 00:18:23,777
Mr. Caulfield's
with him right now.

00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,715
Mr. Caulfield.

00:18:29,917 --> 00:18:31,685
You asked to be kept
up to date on our progress.

00:18:31,752 --> 00:18:33,453
I'll be damned.

00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,721
You found the guy?

00:18:34,788 --> 00:18:36,123
Perhaps.

00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:37,624
We found the sword.

00:18:37,691 --> 00:18:42,162
See? I promised you this matter
would be resolved, Yuri.

00:18:43,197 --> 00:18:44,431
Uh...

00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:47,301
we'll need to take
this back to our lab.

00:18:47,367 --> 00:18:49,937
No. You people have already
lost it once.

00:18:50,971 --> 00:18:53,540
It's part of an
ongoing investigation.

00:18:53,607 --> 00:18:55,108
We need to process it.

00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:56,477
This sword is invaluable.

00:18:56,543 --> 00:18:57,911
To us as well.

00:18:57,978 --> 00:19:01,014
Surely this is open
for conversation, Mr...

00:19:01,081 --> 00:19:02,282
I don't think so.

00:19:03,383 --> 00:19:05,452
I do have a question
for Mr. Yamamoto.

00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,955
Your collection is
primarily 17th century,

00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:10,290
but we found one piece,
a suit of armor,

00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:13,126
that our research dates
to the mid-19th century.

00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:17,164
I don't have a suit of armor
in my collection.

00:19:20,667 --> 00:19:23,804
What is going on here?

00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,606
Mr. Caulfield,

00:19:25,672 --> 00:19:28,041
we'd like to take a look
at your personal vault.

00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:31,778
( <i>beeping</i> )

00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:37,818
Oh, my God.

00:19:39,853 --> 00:19:41,321
The cash-- it's gone.

00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:43,657
How the hell did
they get in here?

00:19:49,363 --> 00:19:51,131
How much cash
did you have in here?

00:19:51,198 --> 00:19:55,669
90% of the casino's cash
is in the basement vault.

00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:59,173
I only keep an
emergency reserve here.

00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:01,742
Ten million...

00:20:02,676 --> 00:20:03,710
...at all times.

00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:11,919
The Trojan horse?

00:20:11,985 --> 00:20:13,587
Someone was
inside the armor,

00:20:13,654 --> 00:20:15,189
hiding in plain sight?

00:20:22,963 --> 00:20:23,831
Maybe.

00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,501
And you just
wheeled him in here?

00:20:27,568 --> 00:20:30,270
Get me my lawyers. Assemble everyone.

00:20:30,337 --> 00:20:31,605
I need answers.

00:20:31,672 --> 00:20:33,073
Yes sir.

00:20:34,241 --> 00:20:38,479
And the con goes on.

00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,920
Well, this explains
the glucose.

00:20:57,986 --> 00:20:59,655
Food source.

00:20:59,721 --> 00:21:01,823
Probably didn't know how long
he was going to be in the suit.

00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:03,425
What's in the other bag?

00:21:03,492 --> 00:21:04,560
Urine.

00:21:05,861 --> 00:21:07,462
He was in there
for a while.

00:21:09,398 --> 00:21:11,667
How you doing
with those money bands?

00:21:11,733 --> 00:21:13,035
$10,000 per band.

00:21:13,101 --> 00:21:16,038
When I get to a thousand,
I'll let you know.

00:21:19,741 --> 00:21:22,244
( <i>tune-like beeping</i> )

00:21:25,047 --> 00:21:27,516
I think it's the code
from the vault.

00:21:28,684 --> 00:21:29,484
Must've recorded it.

00:21:31,186 --> 00:21:33,822
( <i>beeps</i> )

00:21:35,424 --> 00:21:37,059
( <i>beeps</i> )

00:21:50,372 --> 00:21:52,441
( <i>beeping</i> )

00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,274
How did you open

00:22:02,341 --> 00:22:04,543
the safe door?
The same way
our thief did:

00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:07,346
using your musical code.

00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:09,681
Mr. Caulfield,

00:22:09,748 --> 00:22:11,350
you have video surveillance?

00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:12,784
Nothing in my vault
or in my office,

00:22:12,851 --> 00:22:13,886
but I'll get you everything

00:22:13,952 --> 00:22:15,888
from this floor.

00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:20,692
For you...

00:22:23,362 --> 00:22:24,663
...and you.

00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:27,499
Just in case.

00:22:27,566 --> 00:22:29,968
Are Angela's
tox result in yet?
Blood alcohol level

00:22:30,035 --> 00:22:32,571
of .14 percent.
Her friends didn't say

00:22:32,638 --> 00:22:33,906
anything about drinking.

00:22:33,972 --> 00:22:35,407
Well, I'm just getting
warmed up.

00:22:35,474 --> 00:22:37,175
Tox panel
detected traces

00:22:37,242 --> 00:22:38,310
of thujone.

00:22:38,377 --> 00:22:39,845
Thujone is
the psychoactive chemical

00:22:39,912 --> 00:22:42,381
found in absinthe, a liquor
distilled from wormwood.

00:22:42,447 --> 00:22:44,216
Isn't absinthe illegal?

00:22:44,283 --> 00:22:46,485
In the US. Banned in 1912.

00:22:46,552 --> 00:22:48,487
Apparently, toxic byproducts
are released

00:22:48,554 --> 00:22:49,855
during the distilling process.

00:22:49,922 --> 00:22:51,757
Stuff's supposed to make you
a little crazy.

00:22:51,823 --> 00:22:53,892
And how would Angela
get a hold of this?

00:22:53,959 --> 00:22:56,061
Well, this is not coming
from personal experience,

00:22:56,128 --> 00:22:57,829
but according to a
friend of a friend

00:22:57,896 --> 00:23:00,599
of an acquaintance,
absinthe is rumored to be served

00:23:00,666 --> 00:23:02,000
in certain underground clubs.

00:23:02,067 --> 00:23:05,003
Like a blood bar.

Sure. What are you into?

00:23:31,901 --> 00:23:32,902
We're into crime scenes.

00:23:32,969 --> 00:23:34,504
And you are...?

00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:36,272
Lazarus Kane.

00:23:36,339 --> 00:23:38,508
Did Angela Sommerville
call you that?

00:23:38,574 --> 00:23:40,543
I don't know
any Angela Sommerville.

00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:43,012
What about Daegonna?

00:23:44,647 --> 00:23:46,416
She file a complaint against me?

00:23:46,482 --> 00:23:47,583
Why would she do that?

00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:49,585
Look, everything we did
was consensual.

00:23:49,652 --> 00:23:51,187
It's not illegal to
drink someone's blood.

00:23:51,254 --> 00:23:52,388
She was into it.

00:23:52,455 --> 00:23:55,091
That neonate...

00:23:55,158 --> 00:23:57,060
she offered herself to me.

00:23:57,126 --> 00:23:59,195
Did she offer herself
to you last night?

00:23:59,262 --> 00:24:01,164
We had a drink
together here.

00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:02,899
Absinthe?

00:24:02,966 --> 00:24:04,434
What's this about?

00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,401
Was that the last time

00:24:05,468 --> 00:24:06,536
you saw her?

00:24:06,602 --> 00:24:07,403
No. Later on,
I swung by

00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:09,205
her court and daggered

00:24:09,272 --> 00:24:11,374
the relationship.
How long had
the two of you

00:24:11,441 --> 00:24:12,642
been together?

00:24:12,709 --> 00:24:13,743
For the past three months,

00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:15,745
she's been my donor.

00:24:15,812 --> 00:24:18,214
And you were her donor?

00:24:18,281 --> 00:24:19,882
No, it doesn't
work like that.

00:24:19,949 --> 00:24:22,185
Daegonna belonged to me.

00:24:22,251 --> 00:24:26,422
Okay... but you were
<i>someone's</i> donor.

00:24:26,489 --> 00:24:28,057
Well, under the right
circumstances,

00:24:28,124 --> 00:24:29,726
I'll do just about anything.

00:24:29,792 --> 00:24:30,793
How 'bout murder?

00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:33,229
Daegonna was killed
last night.

00:24:33,296 --> 00:24:35,064
Well, I don't know anything
about that.

00:24:35,131 --> 00:24:37,233
See, I follow very
strict guidelines:

00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,568
Black Veil.

00:24:38,635 --> 00:24:39,936
Principle 11:

00:24:40,003 --> 00:24:42,138
you never mistreat your donors.

00:24:42,205 --> 00:24:43,740
And that pendant
around you neck?

00:24:43,806 --> 00:24:46,376
That wouldn't happen
to contain blood,

00:24:46,442 --> 00:24:48,511
would it?
Yeah.

00:24:49,545 --> 00:24:50,747
Whose?

00:24:50,813 --> 00:24:52,915
It's Daegonna's, okay?

00:24:52,982 --> 00:24:54,917
She gave it to me
couple weeks ago.

00:24:54,984 --> 00:24:58,521
I offered to give it back,
but she wanted me to keep it...

00:24:58,588 --> 00:24:59,889
said her psi belonged to me.

00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:01,658
"Psi"?

00:25:02,692 --> 00:25:04,594
Life-force, blood.

00:25:04,661 --> 00:25:06,162
We're going to need

00:25:06,229 --> 00:25:07,830
that pendant for evidence.

00:25:07,897 --> 00:25:10,900
And a sample of your...

00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:12,468
DNA.

00:25:12,535 --> 00:25:13,803
Knock yourself out.

00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:16,039
Oh, I prefer saliva.

00:25:16,105 --> 00:25:17,674
Aw...
Open up.

00:25:20,009 --> 00:25:21,778
Right.

00:25:26,749 --> 00:25:28,351
STOKES:
There's our man.

00:25:28,418 --> 00:25:29,352
And the time?

00:25:29,419 --> 00:25:30,954
3:15 a.m.

00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,722
He's certainly
aware of the cameras.

00:25:32,789 --> 00:25:34,724
Yeah, you really can't get
a good look at him

00:25:34,791 --> 00:25:36,059
from any angle.

00:25:36,125 --> 00:25:38,861
He's walking like
he crapped his pants.

00:25:38,928 --> 00:25:40,363
I'm thinking
that might be the money.

00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:47,003
An employee ID card?

00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:48,304
It gets better.

00:25:57,613 --> 00:26:00,116
That's Brandon Miller,
the security guard.

00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:02,685
Hmm.

00:26:02,752 --> 00:26:04,320
Okay, so find the
best shot you can

00:26:04,387 --> 00:26:06,322
of our mystery thief.

00:26:06,389 --> 00:26:09,392
If he is an employee,
you should be able to ID him.

00:26:09,459 --> 00:26:12,562
There's over 3,000 employees
who work at the Mediterranean,

00:26:12,629 --> 00:26:15,231
and this guy is not really
giving me much to go on here.

00:26:15,298 --> 00:26:18,267
Yes, but technology
is a wonderful thing, Nick.

00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,375
Lazarus may have been sucking
on Angela's shoulders,

00:26:25,441 --> 00:26:27,343
but he did not bite her jugular.

00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:29,545
His DNA's inconsistent
with the saliva

00:26:29,612 --> 00:26:31,814
swabbed from the
puncture wounds
around her neck.

00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:32,915
Damn.

00:26:32,982 --> 00:26:34,417
What about that pendant?

00:26:34,484 --> 00:26:36,219
You know, nothing says
"I love you"

00:26:36,286 --> 00:26:38,321
like an ounce of fresh blood.

00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:39,889
It is Angela's blood,

00:26:39,956 --> 00:26:42,091
and it's mixed with
a polyester base.

00:26:42,158 --> 00:26:44,394
Polyester base
is an inert fluid

00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:47,263
prepackaged in
test tubes used
for HIV testing.

00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:48,665
It helps prepare
the blood

00:26:48,731 --> 00:26:51,167
for centrifugation
by forming a barrier

00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:52,935
between the blood cells
and the serum.

00:26:53,002 --> 00:26:55,605
Angela's parents only insisted
upon only one thing...

00:26:55,672 --> 00:26:57,907
That she be tested for HIV.

00:28:04,073 --> 00:28:05,642

00:28:08,011 --> 00:28:08,911

00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:10,580
CPR dummy.

00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:12,849
Yeah. Had to cancel
a class on Sunday

00:28:12,915 --> 00:28:14,283
'cause we couldn't find
Macaulay.

00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:15,451
Macaulay?

00:28:15,518 --> 00:28:17,920
Culkin. Our dummy.

00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:20,056
You know, 'cause his
mouth is always open.

00:28:24,594 --> 00:28:25,862
Is this Macaulay?

00:28:25,928 --> 00:28:27,830
Yeah, that's him.

00:28:27,897 --> 00:28:28,798
Can we get him back?

00:28:28,865 --> 00:28:30,767
Soon as we're done
with him.

00:28:35,772 --> 00:28:38,474
SIDLE:
Security guard put the sword
in the crawlspace.

00:28:38,541 --> 00:28:40,376
It's got to be his prints.

00:28:40,443 --> 00:28:42,178
GRISSOM:
Well, let's find
out, shall we?

00:28:42,245 --> 00:28:43,179
Hey.

00:28:43,246 --> 00:28:44,380
Nick, want to do me a favor

00:28:44,447 --> 00:28:45,548
and tape-lift that?

00:28:45,615 --> 00:28:47,050
Sure.

00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:00,596
Grissom, how's our insurance?

00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:05,101
I was being careful,
I swear.

00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:15,578
Should 400-year-old lacquer
look this good?

00:29:17,914 --> 00:29:20,249
And smell like acrylic?

00:29:35,665 --> 00:29:37,433
( <i>crunches</i> )

00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,403
What kind of
precious stone
breaks that easily?

00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:42,739
A fake one.

00:29:42,805 --> 00:29:46,075
This is nothing more
than a hardened ball of wax.

00:29:46,142 --> 00:29:48,411
Do you think someone
switched swords on us?

00:29:48,478 --> 00:29:51,881
Well, so far,
nothing's what it seems.

00:30:02,792 --> 00:30:04,627
Smells like tea.

00:30:06,462 --> 00:30:08,097
Sometimes

00:30:08,164 --> 00:30:11,734
paper products
or other materials like silk--

00:30:11,801 --> 00:30:14,437
they soak it in tea
to give an aged look.

00:30:14,504 --> 00:30:17,407
The paint on this mask
is coming right off,

00:30:17,473 --> 00:30:20,076
layer by layer.

00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:29,652
I think this is boot polish.

00:30:29,719 --> 00:30:31,788
Another aging method?

00:30:31,854 --> 00:30:34,590
So it's not just the sword.
This...

00:30:34,657 --> 00:30:36,793
This whole collection's a fake?

00:30:36,859 --> 00:30:38,428
A what?

00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:40,797
We believe
this collection

00:30:40,863 --> 00:30:41,898
is worthless.

00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:44,567
Well-made,
historically accurate,

00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:47,136
but, uh...
probably worthless.

00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:58,047
Your head of security said

00:30:58,114 --> 00:31:00,283
that Mr. Yamamoto's collection
was documented

00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:02,085
by an internal registrar.

00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:05,121
Vanessa Green. I-I
thought you spoke
to her yesterday.

00:31:05,188 --> 00:31:06,756
She was on vacation...

00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:09,359
but even though she's not
an official appraiser,

00:31:09,425 --> 00:31:11,094
she should've been able to tell
these were fakes,

00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,029
don't you think?

00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,109
Mr. Yamamoto?

00:31:28,544 --> 00:31:30,647
I'd like a word with you.

00:31:36,753 --> 00:31:38,354
Mr. Yamamoto?

00:31:38,421 --> 00:31:40,023
It seems he's left.

00:31:40,089 --> 00:31:42,058
Gentlemen, no luggage.

00:31:42,125 --> 00:31:43,226
Nothing.

00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:46,562
Son of a bitch!

00:31:47,897 --> 00:31:50,033
He made a fool out of me.

00:31:50,099 --> 00:31:53,069
Well, we have that
in common.

00:31:54,304 --> 00:31:55,471
Find out when
he checked out.

00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:56,706
I'm on it.

00:31:56,773 --> 00:31:59,709
And Vanessa Green.
Where did she go?

00:31:59,776 --> 00:32:00,710
Brandon Miller,

00:32:00,777 --> 00:32:04,013
Nathan Pollard,
Vanessa Green,

00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,715
and Yuri Yamamoto.

00:32:05,782 --> 00:32:07,517
Three of your employees

00:32:07,583 --> 00:32:11,587
and one whale...
all evidently disappear.

00:32:11,654 --> 00:32:14,457
Along with my
$10 million.

00:32:16,292 --> 00:32:18,061
Yamamoto never
checked out.

00:32:18,127 --> 00:32:19,395
Vanessa Green
made reservations

00:32:19,462 --> 00:32:20,897
at the Princeville
in Kauai.

00:32:20,964 --> 00:32:22,732
She never checked in.

00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:26,069
And he left
without his antiques.

00:32:26,135 --> 00:32:28,237
Well...

00:32:28,304 --> 00:32:30,506
he knew they were worthless.

00:32:36,833 --> 00:32:37,834
Um...

00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:40,403
I'll be right with you.

00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:42,939
The tests will be mailed
to you in seven days,

00:32:43,005 --> 00:32:44,740
and they'll include
a toll-free number

00:32:44,807 --> 00:32:46,008
if you have any questions.

00:32:46,075 --> 00:32:47,110
Thank you.

00:32:47,176 --> 00:32:48,411
I didn't
feel a thing.

00:32:50,413 --> 00:32:51,714
Walk-ins?

00:32:51,781 --> 00:32:54,650
Or do you have
an appointment?

00:32:54,717 --> 00:32:56,352
We're from the crime lab.

00:32:56,419 --> 00:32:59,122
We're here about
a Miss Angela Sommerville.

00:32:59,188 --> 00:33:01,524
Last month, your clinic
tested her blood.

00:33:01,591 --> 00:33:03,693
Actually, we don't
do the testing.
Common mistake.

00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:05,094
I'm contracted

00:33:05,161 --> 00:33:08,564
by AdminaLab to withdraw blood,
and the lab processes.

00:33:08,631 --> 00:33:11,267
And the whole thing
is confidential, so...

00:33:11,334 --> 00:33:12,668
Oh, we've already seen
her results.

00:33:12,735 --> 00:33:13,903
She's dead,

00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:16,539
so, the confidentiality
privilege

00:33:16,606 --> 00:33:17,607
no longer applies.

00:33:17,673 --> 00:33:18,908
We need to know
which tech

00:33:18,975 --> 00:33:21,277
withdrew her blood.

00:33:21,344 --> 00:33:22,612
I'm the only tech here.

00:33:22,678 --> 00:33:24,147
Oh.

00:33:24,213 --> 00:33:27,416
Well, there was a pendant
with her blood inside it.

00:33:27,483 --> 00:33:28,985
What does that
have to do with me?

00:33:29,051 --> 00:33:30,953
Her blood was mixed
with a polyester base.

00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:33,322
I think you know
what that means.

00:33:33,389 --> 00:33:37,460
I... know
who you're talking about.

00:33:42,732 --> 00:33:45,368
I have a favor to ask you.

00:33:46,536 --> 00:33:48,838
Do you want to help?

00:33:48,905 --> 00:33:52,175
I'd taken more than enough
for testing purposes,

00:33:52,241 --> 00:33:54,811
so, I figured
it's her blood.

00:33:54,877 --> 00:33:57,180
Why not just give it to her?

00:33:57,246 --> 00:34:01,117
My bet is that
it's against your lab's policy.

00:34:01,184 --> 00:34:02,852
Great.

00:34:02,919 --> 00:34:05,688
You going to report me?

00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:09,692
Uh, you can't go in there.

00:34:09,759 --> 00:34:11,994
We have a warrant.

00:34:13,796 --> 00:34:16,232
T-That's my personal fridge.

00:34:19,502 --> 00:34:21,137
Now, what's this blood
doing in there?

00:34:25,708 --> 00:34:28,177
Mr. Jones...

00:34:30,847 --> 00:34:33,683
I'm going to need a sample
of your DNA.

00:34:33,749 --> 00:34:37,553
I bet you don't have a warrant
for that.

00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:39,989
Catherine,

00:34:40,056 --> 00:34:42,825
I think we have
all we need here.

00:34:46,896 --> 00:34:48,831
SIDLE:
<i>Handle is molded plastic fiber.</i>

00:34:48,898 --> 00:34:50,967
Materials are used by hundreds

00:34:51,033 --> 00:34:52,902
of manufacturers
throughout the country.

00:34:52,969 --> 00:34:54,537
It's impossible to trace.

00:34:54,604 --> 00:34:55,872
Vintage cherry red
leathers,

00:34:55,938 --> 00:34:58,040
bronze PVC fabric, aged.

00:34:58,107 --> 00:35:01,878
Countless furniture
and clothing suppliers.

00:35:01,944 --> 00:35:03,179
Nothing really unique.

00:35:03,246 --> 00:35:05,047
But the ivory
on the sword's scabbard

00:35:05,114 --> 00:35:06,115
is unique.

00:35:06,182 --> 00:35:08,251
In fact, it's not ivory.

00:35:08,317 --> 00:35:09,485
It's treated bone from an emu.

00:35:09,552 --> 00:35:10,953
Inexpensive,
but not widely used.

00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:13,523
STOKES:
Only about half a
dozen US importers.

00:35:13,589 --> 00:35:17,059
One did recently make a sale
to a business in Las Vegas.

00:35:17,126 --> 00:35:19,328
That same business
also bought vintage leather,

00:35:19,395 --> 00:35:21,230
molded plastics
and everything else

00:35:21,297 --> 00:35:23,032
he used to make this collection.

00:35:23,099 --> 00:35:25,835
Chen's Scenic
Prop House--

00:35:25,902 --> 00:35:26,903
owned by Graeme Chen

00:35:26,969 --> 00:35:29,005
of 1 Engelfield Road,
Las Vegas, Nevada.

00:35:29,071 --> 00:35:30,740
Also his place
of business.

00:35:30,807 --> 00:35:32,241
As of
five minutes ago,

00:35:32,308 --> 00:35:34,210
no one's answering the phone.

00:35:34,277 --> 00:35:36,946
Call Brass. Get a warrant.

00:35:46,789 --> 00:35:48,925
You know,
I always imagined your house

00:35:48,991 --> 00:35:50,593
would look like this, Gil.

00:35:56,866 --> 00:35:58,801
Hey, Grissom,

00:35:58,868 --> 00:36:00,803
check this out.

00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:03,239
Prototypes, maybe.

00:36:11,214 --> 00:36:12,949
Looks like Mr. Chen

00:36:13,015 --> 00:36:15,618
tried a few times
before committing.

00:36:15,685 --> 00:36:19,522
Well, he certainly
does beautiful work.

00:36:26,729 --> 00:36:28,164
BRASS:
Want to see

00:36:28,231 --> 00:36:30,099
a picture
of Mr. Chen?

00:36:34,504 --> 00:36:36,806
I guess he lived here, too.

00:36:36,873 --> 00:36:39,575
GRISSOM:
Mr. Chen is
Mr. Yamamoto.

00:36:39,642 --> 00:36:42,612
He's not even Japanese.

00:36:42,678 --> 00:36:45,248
So, this is how Ty Caulfield's
high rollers live--

00:36:45,314 --> 00:36:47,517
a cot
in a warehouse.

00:36:47,583 --> 00:36:51,287
Well, I'm guessing
he spent all his money
on the baccarat tables,

00:36:51,354 --> 00:36:52,989
buying himself
a reputation.

00:37:00,296 --> 00:37:02,632
You got to spend money
to make money.

00:37:02,698 --> 00:37:03,733
Hey.

00:37:05,935 --> 00:37:08,671
Take a look at this.

00:37:08,738 --> 00:37:11,107
Brandon Miller,
the security guard,

00:37:11,174 --> 00:37:13,042
the lifeguard,
Nathan Pollard,
and I'm guessing

00:37:13,109 --> 00:37:14,610
the registrar,
Vanessa Green.

00:37:14,677 --> 00:37:16,345
So, Mr. Chen made
their costumes,

00:37:16,412 --> 00:37:17,980
their props
and their scenery.

00:37:18,047 --> 00:37:21,117
WOMAN:
♪ Three little maids
from school are we... ♪

00:37:21,184 --> 00:37:24,821
♪ Three little maids
from school are we... ♪

00:37:24,887 --> 00:37:27,056
( <i>tones beeping same refrain)</i>

00:37:27,123 --> 00:37:28,758
You ever listen
to Gilbert and Sullivan?

00:37:30,226 --> 00:37:31,627
No.

00:37:31,694 --> 00:37:33,396
Ty Caulfield does.

00:37:33,463 --> 00:37:35,565
The code
from his digital vault.

00:37:35,631 --> 00:37:36,899
Coincidence?

00:37:36,966 --> 00:37:38,234
I don't think so.

00:37:38,301 --> 00:37:42,205
How much does $10
million in cash
weigh, I wonder?

00:37:43,439 --> 00:37:44,674
A lot.

00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:49,178
Sara, I'm going to need the
money bands you collected.

00:37:49,245 --> 00:37:51,881
Nick, you get to do the math.

00:37:56,786 --> 00:37:58,821
The blood
in your personal fridge

00:37:58,888 --> 00:38:01,124
belonged to
Angela Sommerville.

00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:02,592
We found a lip print

00:38:02,658 --> 00:38:05,061
on the rim of the container
we confiscated.

00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:11,234
It's not a crime
to drink someone's blood.

00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,602
How did her blood

00:38:12,668 --> 00:38:14,237
end up in your fridge?

00:38:14,303 --> 00:38:16,672
When Angela came in
for her HIV test,

00:38:16,739 --> 00:38:18,307
she asked me to withdraw

00:38:18,374 --> 00:38:19,408
an extra unit.

00:38:19,475 --> 00:38:20,710
She paid me
20 bucks to store it,

00:38:20,777 --> 00:38:22,779
and never came back
to pick it up.

00:38:22,845 --> 00:38:25,281
And what, you just got thirsty?

00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:28,751
Angela's test date

00:38:28,818 --> 00:38:30,720
was 32 days ago,

00:38:30,787 --> 00:38:33,589
and our lab determined
that the blood

00:38:33,656 --> 00:38:35,191
from your fridge

00:38:35,258 --> 00:38:36,793
was less than
a week old.

00:38:36,859 --> 00:38:37,960
Would you explain that?

00:38:38,027 --> 00:38:42,498
Most girls just turn away
when I stick the needle in.

00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,636
<i>She was into it.</i>

00:38:46,702 --> 00:38:51,007
I started... watching over her.

00:38:51,073 --> 00:38:54,477
She was dating this... wanna-be.

00:38:54,544 --> 00:38:57,713
A total Hollywood freak show.

00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:59,415
Oh, so you're the real thing?

00:38:59,482 --> 00:39:02,118
These don't come out.

00:39:02,185 --> 00:39:04,921
Mr. Jones,
give me a file,

00:39:04,987 --> 00:39:06,589
and I could sharpen my teeth

00:39:06,656 --> 00:39:07,790
into fangs.

00:39:07,857 --> 00:39:09,258
I was born with these.

00:39:09,325 --> 00:39:11,427
Mm-hmm.

00:39:11,494 --> 00:39:12,895
The night that

00:39:12,962 --> 00:39:14,163
Angela was murdered,

00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:16,098
you were
"watching over her."

00:39:16,165 --> 00:39:18,134
I will not
be tied down.

00:39:18,201 --> 00:39:20,670
No, Lazarus,
please don't go.

00:39:20,736 --> 00:39:22,505
BOBBY:
<i>The poser just took off.</i>

00:39:22,572 --> 00:39:26,275
She... invited me in.

00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:28,611
Yeah?

00:39:28,678 --> 00:39:31,514
She was glad to see me.

00:39:33,082 --> 00:39:34,750
Who are you?

00:39:34,817 --> 00:39:36,853
We kissed.

00:39:36,919 --> 00:39:38,721
Get off me.

00:39:38,788 --> 00:39:40,923
She, um...

00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:44,193
offered herself to me.

00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:46,129
Stop it!

00:39:46,195 --> 00:39:48,297
You mean she offered her blood
to you?

00:39:48,364 --> 00:39:49,899
Yeah.

00:39:49,966 --> 00:39:51,901
( <i>screaming</i> )

00:39:53,569 --> 00:39:54,804
She may have

00:39:54,871 --> 00:39:56,305
offered her blood to you,

00:39:56,372 --> 00:39:58,374
but you took
her life.

00:39:58,441 --> 00:40:00,510
You murdered her.

00:40:04,447 --> 00:40:06,616
You can't prove that.

00:40:06,682 --> 00:40:08,384
DNA from your saliva

00:40:08,451 --> 00:40:11,154
was on the rim
of the container.

00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:13,523
It's consistent
with the saliva

00:40:13,589 --> 00:40:16,192
surrounding the puncture marks
on Angela's neck.

00:40:16,259 --> 00:40:19,695
I released Angela from her body.

00:40:19,762 --> 00:40:22,231
She's inside of me now.

00:40:22,298 --> 00:40:24,233
A part of me.

00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,569
And she's very much alive.

00:40:36,212 --> 00:40:37,246
What's this?

00:40:37,313 --> 00:40:38,347
This is
what's left

00:40:38,414 --> 00:40:39,916
of your $10 million.

00:40:39,982 --> 00:40:41,384
Thank you for reminding me.

00:40:41,451 --> 00:40:42,518
Do you know
how much

00:40:42,585 --> 00:40:43,886
$10 million weighs?

00:40:45,488 --> 00:40:46,956
220 pounds.

00:40:48,357 --> 00:40:51,727
Your lifeguard,
Nathan Pollard-- 5'6",

00:40:51,794 --> 00:40:53,262
140 pounds.

00:40:53,329 --> 00:40:55,531
Strong little bastard.

00:40:55,598 --> 00:40:57,400
Mmm.

00:40:57,467 --> 00:41:01,170
Say, could I borrow $10,000

00:41:01,237 --> 00:41:02,472
in $100 bills?

00:41:02,538 --> 00:41:03,506
What?

00:41:03,573 --> 00:41:05,041
Only for a demonstration.

00:41:05,108 --> 00:41:06,943
I'm sorry.
I'm all out.

00:41:07,009 --> 00:41:08,277
That's okay.

00:41:08,344 --> 00:41:10,246
I brought my own.

00:41:10,313 --> 00:41:12,048
It's only paper,
but it's

00:41:12,115 --> 00:41:14,584
the same size,
weight and density.

00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:16,886
Did you know...

00:41:18,254 --> 00:41:23,626
money bands are wrapped tightly
around stacks of bills?

00:41:23,693 --> 00:41:25,628
They're
very difficult

00:41:25,695 --> 00:41:27,029
to slip off.

00:41:27,096 --> 00:41:29,265
In fact, the only way
you can get them off

00:41:29,332 --> 00:41:30,633
is to tear them.

00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,702
What's your point?

00:41:32,768 --> 00:41:35,104
None of your money bands
were torn.

00:41:39,442 --> 00:41:40,443
Now, I don't know

00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:43,312
how much money you had
in your vault, Mr. Caulfield,

00:41:43,379 --> 00:41:44,714
but I'm pretty sure
I know

00:41:44,781 --> 00:41:46,616
how much you're going
to be asking

00:41:46,682 --> 00:41:48,584
your insurance
company for.

00:41:48,651 --> 00:41:51,721
You see, that's why
you had your "thief"

00:41:51,788 --> 00:41:54,457
leave the money bands
behind.

00:41:54,524 --> 00:41:57,727
You hired Mr. Chen
and his merry band of actors

00:41:57,794 --> 00:41:59,262
to rip you off.

00:41:59,328 --> 00:42:01,631
I'm sure
you paid them,

00:42:01,697 --> 00:42:04,967
but nothing close
to $10 million.

00:42:07,804 --> 00:42:11,174
"Your notions, though many,
are not worth a penny."

00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:14,744
Mmm. <i>The Mikado.</i>

00:42:14,811 --> 00:42:16,546
Notions are all you have.

00:42:16,612 --> 00:42:19,582
Otherwise, we'd be downtown
instead of here

00:42:19,649 --> 00:42:21,918
in my office.

00:42:21,984 --> 00:42:25,955
You know, I've always been
a big supporter of the arts.

00:42:26,022 --> 00:42:27,423
Hence, Mr. Yamamoto...

00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:28,691
Uh, Mr. Chen's...

00:42:28,758 --> 00:42:31,194
Hence, the exhibition.

00:42:32,662 --> 00:42:36,766
Over the years, I've financed
theatrical productions.

00:42:36,833 --> 00:42:38,334
Including <i>The Mikado?</i>

00:42:40,937 --> 00:42:44,373
Well, you know,
one of your "partners"

00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,642
is going to come back
again someday.

00:42:46,709 --> 00:42:48,711
He's going to miss his family,

00:42:48,778 --> 00:42:50,680
friends,
the ensemble.

00:42:50,746 --> 00:42:52,181
He'll be back.

00:42:52,248 --> 00:42:55,151
And I'm guessing
he'll tell us all about

00:42:55,218 --> 00:42:56,919
your latest
production.

00:42:56,986 --> 00:43:01,724
Yes, well,
until then, Mr. Grissom.

00:43:01,791 --> 00:43:04,660
Until then.

00:43:07,763 --> 00:43:11,100
I'm going to hand my findings
over to your insurance company.

00:43:12,869 --> 00:43:16,506
I wouldn't count
on receiving a payment.
