Mike Trent and
his wife Laurel.

Both shot execution-style

so any evidence of the killers
is going to be out here.

00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,549
And bail on bikes.

00:11:12,616 --> 00:11:14,518
That's a little low-rent,
don't you think?

00:11:14,584 --> 00:11:16,720
Yeah, but I'm thinking,
in a neighborhood like this,

00:11:16,787 --> 00:11:18,088
if you burn rubber
out of here,

00:11:18,155 --> 00:11:19,756
it's gonna cause
a lot of attention.

00:11:19,823 --> 00:11:21,691
If you roll quietly away
on a bike, though...

00:11:21,758 --> 00:11:24,761
Ah, no one's the wiser.
Okay, I get it.

00:11:24,828 --> 00:11:27,364
This is the resident gate
that Greg called me from;
he couldn't get in.

00:11:27,431 --> 00:11:29,433
He needed a code.
Sara did find

00:11:29,499 --> 00:11:31,601
an orange peel in the side yard.

00:11:31,668 --> 00:11:33,870
What do you think,
sticky fingers?

00:11:33,937 --> 00:11:35,472
Does citrus illuminate?

00:11:35,539 --> 00:11:37,941
Sugar will,
if it's derivatized.

00:11:38,008 --> 00:11:39,643
Do you have
any fluorescent reagents?

00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:40,944
I've got ANTS.

00:11:41,011 --> 00:11:42,779
Not the insect.
Amino-naphthalene

00:11:42,846 --> 00:11:44,247
Trisulfonic acid.
trisulfonic acid.

00:11:44,314 --> 00:11:45,949
You're trying to stump me.
I can feel it.

00:11:46,016 --> 00:11:47,117
Let me check it out.

00:11:51,521 --> 00:11:54,291
The ANTS should make it light up
under the ALS.

00:12:07,871 --> 00:12:11,308
One, three...

00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:13,176
five and six.

00:12:13,243 --> 00:12:16,113
In some configuration.

00:12:16,179 --> 00:12:18,915
They had the code.

00:12:18,982 --> 00:12:21,051
We're mid-case.
Why do we have to do this now?

00:12:21,118 --> 00:12:22,552
I have to get this
evaluation in,

00:12:22,619 --> 00:12:25,088
or <i>I'm</i> gonna get written up.

00:12:25,155 --> 00:12:27,124
Okay.

00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:29,760
My goals.

00:12:29,826 --> 00:12:31,328
Mm...

00:12:31,395 --> 00:12:32,929
Oh, all right, okay.

00:12:32,996 --> 00:12:35,899
For starters, I'd like
two consecutive nights off.

00:12:35,966 --> 00:12:38,001
I would like to cut my triples
down to ten a year

00:12:38,068 --> 00:12:39,169
instead of the usual 20,

00:12:39,236 --> 00:12:42,005
and, uh,
I would love to find

00:12:42,072 --> 00:12:44,041
a reliable baby-sitter,
so I could have myself

00:12:44,107 --> 00:12:45,409
some kind of a personal life.

00:12:45,475 --> 00:12:48,545
You don't have
a personal life?

00:12:48,612 --> 00:12:50,013
I... Write <i>this</i> down:

00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,615
I haven't had sex in six--

00:12:51,681 --> 00:12:54,451
no-- seven months.

00:12:59,856 --> 00:13:01,792
How can I help?

00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,862
You. Advance, I mean.

00:13:05,929 --> 00:13:07,297
Do you...

00:13:07,364 --> 00:13:10,767
have any interest
in changing sections in the lab,

00:13:10,834 --> 00:13:12,702
for instance?
Gil, how do you do this?

00:13:12,769 --> 00:13:16,473
Honestly, how do you juggle
scheduling and vacations and...

00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:19,609
The goal of any supervisor
is to teach someone

00:13:19,676 --> 00:13:21,445
how to take his place someday.

00:13:21,511 --> 00:13:23,180
Are you going someplace?

00:13:23,246 --> 00:13:25,182
You never know.

00:13:25,248 --> 00:13:26,917
Are you considering me?

00:13:26,983 --> 00:13:28,151
Why not?

00:13:28,218 --> 00:13:30,220
You're certainly
qualified.

00:13:30,287 --> 00:13:34,224
But... a CSI who
uses the DNA lab

00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:36,426
to establish her
own paternity...

00:13:36,493 --> 00:13:40,731
calls into question...
her judgment,

00:13:40,797 --> 00:13:42,799
don't you think?

00:13:51,908 --> 00:13:54,177
You've left that out.

00:13:54,244 --> 00:13:55,912
Are you covering for me?

00:13:55,979 --> 00:13:57,180
I believe

00:13:57,247 --> 00:13:59,349
that we've dealt
with this issue,

00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:00,851
handled it internally.

00:14:00,917 --> 00:14:02,819
As far as I'm concerned,
it's dead.

00:14:02,886 --> 00:14:04,755
Besides,

00:14:04,821 --> 00:14:06,189
you'll never do it again.

00:14:06,256 --> 00:14:09,726
So just sign your
name by the red "X."

00:14:11,228 --> 00:14:13,196
Before I sign, um,

00:14:13,263 --> 00:14:15,866
since we're putting
all of our cards on the table,

00:14:15,932 --> 00:14:18,435
there's something
you should know.

00:14:18,502 --> 00:14:21,338
Sam Braun wrote me a check,

00:14:21,405 --> 00:14:25,042
and... I cashed it.

00:14:27,611 --> 00:14:30,213
For how much?

00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:36,053
Enough to where Lindsay and I
can do anything and...

00:14:36,119 --> 00:14:39,056
not enough to where
we can do nothing.

00:14:39,122 --> 00:14:42,092
Sam Braun was a murder suspect
in one of your cases.

00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:44,227
How does this not
look like a payoff?

00:14:44,294 --> 00:14:45,429
I consulted an attorney.

00:14:45,495 --> 00:14:47,230
It is a check
from a father to a daughter.

00:14:47,297 --> 00:14:49,399
It is completely out of
departmental jurisdiction.

00:14:49,466 --> 00:14:51,001
What about conflict of interest?

00:14:51,068 --> 00:14:52,669
Not just for you
but for this lab.

00:14:52,736 --> 00:14:55,238
Gil, I would never compromise
you or the lab.

00:14:55,305 --> 00:14:56,640
Maybe not legally,

00:14:56,706 --> 00:14:58,241
but ethically?

00:15:03,613 --> 00:15:05,382
What else should I know,

00:15:05,449 --> 00:15:07,517
Catherine?

00:15:07,584 --> 00:15:09,586
That's everything.

00:15:24,501 --> 00:15:25,836
Talk to me.

00:15:25,902 --> 00:15:27,804
Orange peels, seeds,
cigarette butts.

00:15:27,871 --> 00:15:30,173
I'm logging them in
and moving them to DNA.

00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,411
Okay, so you've gone
through her purse,
uh, her wallet...

00:15:34,478 --> 00:15:36,546
Yeah, everything's there--
money, credit cards.

00:15:36,613 --> 00:15:38,014
Yeah. What about
the briefcase?

00:15:38,081 --> 00:15:40,584
Empty. Stop.
I-I got a system here.

00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:43,253
I found this wadded up
in her purse.

00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,155
It's a release form--
permission to film

00:15:45,222 --> 00:15:46,690
an adult movie
at the Acid Drop.

00:15:46,757 --> 00:15:48,759
From Drake the Snake
Productions.

00:15:48,825 --> 00:15:50,060
Signed by a Drake Snow.

00:15:55,932 --> 00:15:57,868
( <i>rock music playing</i> )

00:16:12,149 --> 00:16:14,151
I need to see your boss.

00:16:14,217 --> 00:16:16,086
Follow me.

00:16:16,153 --> 00:16:17,754
Tonight's for Mike.

00:16:17,821 --> 00:16:21,091
We pay our respects
by ringing the register.

00:16:21,158 --> 00:16:23,727
Now, I don't mind
if you're talking,

00:16:23,794 --> 00:16:26,229
just as long
as they're drinking.

00:16:26,296 --> 00:16:27,798
Watch the doubles...

00:16:27,864 --> 00:16:30,734
Uh...

00:16:32,569 --> 00:16:35,572
Watch the doubles. Be smart.

00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:36,973
You do that, we're gonna
take this party

00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,175
through till 6:00
in the morning.

00:16:38,241 --> 00:16:39,476
And most importantly, have fun.

00:16:39,543 --> 00:16:40,911
Okay.

00:16:40,977 --> 00:16:43,780
Go make some money.
See you later.

00:16:45,749 --> 00:16:48,485
You here about Mike?

00:16:48,552 --> 00:16:50,287
Yes, I am.

00:16:50,353 --> 00:16:52,522
Let's go somewhere private.

00:16:52,589 --> 00:16:54,558
Sorry for the inconvenience,
everybody.

00:16:54,624 --> 00:16:56,760
When you come back,
next bottle's on me.

00:16:56,827 --> 00:16:58,028
Go ahead.
( <i>clears throat</i> )

00:16:58,095 --> 00:17:00,030
Thanks, Chief. We're going
to shut her down

00:17:00,097 --> 00:17:01,131
for about half an hour.

00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:02,399
Well...

00:17:02,466 --> 00:17:03,433
this <i>is</i> private.

00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,468
It was,

00:17:04,534 --> 00:17:05,635
um...

00:17:05,702 --> 00:17:07,237
It was a real
shock, you know?

00:17:07,304 --> 00:17:09,473
Mike and Laurel getting
killed like that.

00:17:09,539 --> 00:17:11,475
But I got to say,
if they had a choice

00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:13,310
how to go out,
it would have been

00:17:13,377 --> 00:17:14,511
together.

00:17:14,578 --> 00:17:17,614
For him, the sun rose
and set with her.

00:17:17,681 --> 00:17:20,817
He didn't treat her
like a trophy wife?

00:17:20,884 --> 00:17:22,018
No. You kidding?

00:17:22,085 --> 00:17:24,388
No. He got her
off the VHS covers,

00:17:24,454 --> 00:17:27,124
and she made a
home for him.

00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:28,291
You know?

00:17:28,358 --> 00:17:30,827
Have a seat.

00:17:30,894 --> 00:17:32,629
( <i>clears throat</i> )

00:17:32,696 --> 00:17:34,564
Um, and what was, uh...

00:17:34,631 --> 00:17:37,801
What was your professional
affiliation with him?

00:17:37,868 --> 00:17:40,170
I run his clubs.

00:17:40,237 --> 00:17:41,204
Ever since he got out

00:17:41,271 --> 00:17:43,206
of the partner business
with Kyle Goode.

00:17:44,941 --> 00:17:48,412
Have you seen this Mr. Goode
lately?

00:17:48,478 --> 00:17:50,247
He shows his face
every once in a while.

00:17:50,313 --> 00:17:52,649
I just try to keep him away
from Mike, you know?

00:17:52,716 --> 00:17:54,184
As much as humanly possible.

00:17:55,552 --> 00:17:57,554
And...

00:17:57,621 --> 00:18:00,590
what about this Drake Snow guy?

00:18:00,657 --> 00:18:01,591
Drake?

00:18:01,658 --> 00:18:02,859
( <i>laughs</i> ):
Drake the Snake.

00:18:02,926 --> 00:18:04,027
I, uh...

00:18:04,094 --> 00:18:05,162
I hired him.
He's harmless.

00:18:05,228 --> 00:18:06,263
He saw one

00:18:06,329 --> 00:18:07,431
Ron Jeremy movie.

00:18:07,497 --> 00:18:09,699
Now the guy just sees
dollar signs.

00:18:09,766 --> 00:18:11,635
( <i>laughs</i> )

00:18:11,701 --> 00:18:14,671
Uh, and how did he get along
with the Trents?

00:18:14,738 --> 00:18:16,640
Why don't you go ask him?

00:18:16,706 --> 00:18:18,442
Reading my mind.

00:18:18,508 --> 00:18:20,177
Mm.

00:18:21,878 --> 00:18:22,979
You, uh...

00:18:23,046 --> 00:18:24,548
You never gave me your name.

00:18:24,614 --> 00:18:25,682
Oh.

00:18:25,749 --> 00:18:26,683
Catherine.

00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,151
Catherine.

00:18:28,218 --> 00:18:29,419
Willows.

00:18:30,587 --> 00:18:32,322
Chris Bezich.

00:18:32,389 --> 00:18:34,658
Chris Bezich.

00:18:34,725 --> 00:18:36,393
Come on.

00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,228
Mike and Kyle--
they made all their money

00:18:38,295 --> 00:18:39,496
out of Laurel
taking it off.

00:18:39,563 --> 00:18:42,065
She-She was a cash register
in panties is what she was.

00:18:42,132 --> 00:18:44,334
And you wanted in?

00:18:44,401 --> 00:18:45,702
No. Trust me.

00:18:45,769 --> 00:18:48,472
The last thing that I wanted
was to be partners with Mike.

00:18:48,538 --> 00:18:50,507
Guy'd... Guy'd chew you up
and spit you out

00:18:50,574 --> 00:18:51,508
soon as look at you.

00:18:51,575 --> 00:18:52,542
And Kyle-- forget it.

00:18:52,609 --> 00:18:54,111
Guy'd tell you right
to your face

00:18:54,177 --> 00:18:55,312
he's sticking it to you.

00:18:55,379 --> 00:18:56,713
Pasadena, baby.

00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,181
I got my own plans.

00:18:58,248 --> 00:18:59,683
I-I just...
I just need a location.

00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,251
One location.

00:19:01,318 --> 00:19:02,919
And what?

00:19:02,986 --> 00:19:05,389
Mike didn't agree to it?

00:19:05,455 --> 00:19:06,590
Didn't ask him.

00:19:06,656 --> 00:19:08,658
Last time I asked him
for something,

00:19:08,725 --> 00:19:09,993
he took a swing at me.

00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:10,927
Get the hell out of my...

00:19:10,994 --> 00:19:12,262
I just want the same shot

00:19:12,329 --> 00:19:13,397
that you had, Mike.

00:19:13,463 --> 00:19:14,398
Laurel said that...

00:19:14,464 --> 00:19:15,999
You two aren't
in business anymore.

00:19:16,066 --> 00:19:17,134
( <i>grunts</i> )

00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,936
In the kitchen, you said?

00:19:20,003 --> 00:19:21,004
Yeah.

00:19:21,071 --> 00:19:22,973
So, I wasn't going
to make that mistake again,

00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,541
so I had to try
something different.

00:19:24,608 --> 00:19:25,542
So, I pulled a Geffen.

00:19:25,609 --> 00:19:26,576
I went straight to Yoko.

00:19:26,643 --> 00:19:30,514
Oh, you gave Laurel
the release form.

00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,215
Yeah. She was going
to give it to Mike.

00:19:32,282 --> 00:19:33,283
He was going to sign it,

00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:35,085
and they were going
to get it back to me.

00:19:35,152 --> 00:19:36,219
So much for that.

00:19:36,286 --> 00:19:37,788
All right. So, uh,
listen, Drake.

00:19:37,854 --> 00:19:39,790
I'm going to help you
get that dream shot.

00:19:39,856 --> 00:19:41,792
So that when you do get
into the porn biz,

00:19:41,858 --> 00:19:44,261
you won't have a murder rap
hanging over your head.

00:19:44,327 --> 00:19:46,596
Here.

00:19:46,663 --> 00:19:47,964
Crime Scene 101.

00:19:48,031 --> 00:19:50,434
Stick this in your mouth.

00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,369
Hey, you can set
'em right there.

00:19:52,436 --> 00:19:53,503
Can't believe that

00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:55,472
there's this many
abandoned bikes

00:19:55,539 --> 00:19:56,706
in Charleston Hills.

00:19:56,773 --> 00:19:58,475
These were found
in the alley

00:19:58,542 --> 00:20:01,411
behind the Fire Department,
so check them out.

00:20:14,257 --> 00:20:16,593
Sugar on the handlebars
of both bikes.

00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,961
Just like the keypad.

00:20:18,028 --> 00:20:19,730
So we may have
our getaway bikes.

00:20:19,796 --> 00:20:21,264
We could check
the serial numbers,

00:20:21,331 --> 00:20:22,866
but they're usually
not recorded.

00:20:26,903 --> 00:20:28,371
You know what?
I got an idea.

00:20:28,438 --> 00:20:31,174
Hmm?

00:20:31,241 --> 00:20:33,410
What are you doing?

00:20:38,348 --> 00:20:40,016
Get me a pair
of tweezers, will you?

00:20:46,223 --> 00:20:48,058
( <i>laughs</i> )

00:20:51,728 --> 00:20:53,697
Now how did you know
that receipt was in there?

00:20:53,764 --> 00:20:54,998
Well, I used
to read point spreads.

00:20:55,065 --> 00:20:55,999
Now I read books.

00:20:56,066 --> 00:20:57,634
Good for you.

00:20:57,701 --> 00:21:00,370
Bad for Ross Davis, though.

00:21:02,372 --> 00:21:04,908
This is a little intense
for getting my bike stolen.

00:21:04,975 --> 00:21:06,176
I already got a new one.

00:21:06,243 --> 00:21:07,477
Did you report it?

00:21:07,544 --> 00:21:08,779
No. You're
kidding me, right?

00:21:08,845 --> 00:21:10,347
I got jumped, man.

00:21:10,414 --> 00:21:11,448
By whom?

00:21:11,515 --> 00:21:12,649
By two bucked-ass brothers.

00:21:12,716 --> 00:21:14,384
They were both
yoked as hell.

00:21:14,451 --> 00:21:15,886
Ripped.

00:21:15,952 --> 00:21:17,921
I thought for a second
they were going to kill me.

00:21:17,988 --> 00:21:19,723
( <i>tires squealing</i> )

00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:20,690
Hey, hey.

00:21:20,757 --> 00:21:21,658
( <i>yells</i> )

00:21:24,227 --> 00:21:25,829
BROWN:
Something wrong
with your neck?

00:21:25,896 --> 00:21:26,830
Man, it's killing me.

00:21:26,897 --> 00:21:28,231
I don't know
what the hell

00:21:28,298 --> 00:21:30,167
they hit me with,
but my knees was

00:21:30,233 --> 00:21:31,368
the first to go.

00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:35,038
I believe you were hit
with a stun gun.

00:21:35,105 --> 00:21:37,908
Just like Mike Trent.

00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,675
I found something
on your butt.

00:21:45,742 --> 00:21:47,510
Checking out
my butt again, Greg?

00:21:47,577 --> 00:21:48,845
I was.

00:21:48,912 --> 00:21:51,214
As well as the four butts
Sara got at the crime scene.

00:21:51,281 --> 00:21:52,215
Oh.

00:21:52,282 --> 00:21:54,317
Found something on them
that I can't explain,

00:21:54,384 --> 00:21:55,719
so I sent them over
to Hodges.

00:21:55,785 --> 00:21:57,954
Your butt's fine.

00:21:58,021 --> 00:21:59,489
Switching gears.

00:21:59,556 --> 00:22:01,424
Blood found in
the Trents' bedroom

00:22:01,491 --> 00:22:02,926
is a match to Drake Snow.

00:22:02,992 --> 00:22:04,828
So he told the truth
about the blood

00:22:04,894 --> 00:22:06,296
and lied about
the kitchen.

00:22:06,363 --> 00:22:07,464
Figures.

00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:09,499
Three of the four
cigarette butts

00:22:09,566 --> 00:22:11,134
are also
a match to Drake.

00:22:11,201 --> 00:22:12,669
Puts him
at the scene.

00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:14,304
And the fourth butt?

00:22:14,371 --> 00:22:17,007
Female, not a match
to Laurel Trent.

00:22:17,073 --> 00:22:18,108
Orange seeds?

00:22:18,174 --> 00:22:19,909
Two additional donors,
both male.

00:22:19,976 --> 00:22:21,745
Not a match to any
of our players.

00:22:21,811 --> 00:22:23,413
No hits on CODIS.

00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,348
So we're looking for
two guys and a gal

00:22:25,415 --> 00:22:26,416
who might know Drake.

00:22:26,483 --> 00:22:28,151
BRASS:
<i>We already know you lied.</i>

00:22:28,218 --> 00:22:30,954
We found your blood
in the Trents' bedroom,

00:22:31,021 --> 00:22:32,522
not in the kitchen.

00:22:32,589 --> 00:22:34,257
So what were
you doing in there?

00:22:34,324 --> 00:22:36,292
You putting
the shot in her, or what?

00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:37,961
Hey, look.

00:22:38,028 --> 00:22:39,963
I know where you're
going with this.

00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:42,399
Okay, I was
in the bedroom.

00:22:42,465 --> 00:22:45,201
She wasn't on
her knees. I was.

00:22:45,268 --> 00:22:47,437
I was begging.
Not for sex.

00:22:47,504 --> 00:22:49,973
I was begging
for my business.

00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,841
Drake the Snake Productions.

00:22:51,908 --> 00:22:54,344
Mike comes busting in,
goes ballistic,

00:22:54,411 --> 00:22:55,412
smacks me
in the nose...

00:22:55,478 --> 00:22:56,913
I mean, I know
I keep coming back

00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,214
to this three-and-out thing,

00:22:58,281 --> 00:23:00,350
but maybe because you're
in bed with his wife.

00:23:00,417 --> 00:23:02,886
Laurel and I didn't
have sex in the bedroom.

00:23:02,952 --> 00:23:04,854
We had it on the set--
past tense,

00:23:04,921 --> 00:23:06,189
long time ago.

00:23:06,256 --> 00:23:07,757
Then along came Mike.

00:23:07,824 --> 00:23:09,659
Mike was good for Laurel.

00:23:09,726 --> 00:23:11,594
Mike was not good for me.

00:23:11,661 --> 00:23:13,530
She got carte
blanche-- Laurel.

00:23:13,596 --> 00:23:14,898
Me, I got
a bar back.

00:23:14,964 --> 00:23:15,965
Now I'm popping
blue pills

00:23:16,032 --> 00:23:17,600
looking for something
to bring me down,

00:23:17,667 --> 00:23:18,868
but I know the business.

00:23:18,935 --> 00:23:21,771
I just don't have the capital
to get behind the camera.

00:23:21,838 --> 00:23:23,673
So what does killing
the Trents get you?

00:23:25,842 --> 00:23:27,110
Zero.

00:23:27,177 --> 00:23:31,314
No one was more upset than me.

00:23:31,381 --> 00:23:33,450
You're still pouring drinks.
Boo-hoo.

00:23:33,516 --> 00:23:36,486
And what are you doing
smoking around their place?

00:23:38,088 --> 00:23:39,122
What?

00:23:39,189 --> 00:23:40,824
Yeah, we found cigarette butts

00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:42,926
with your DNA on it
on their property.

00:23:42,992 --> 00:23:45,462
I don't know
what you're talking about.

00:23:45,528 --> 00:23:46,796
I don't.

00:23:46,863 --> 00:23:48,498
I smoke one place, okay?

00:23:48,565 --> 00:23:50,000
I smoke at work.

00:23:50,066 --> 00:23:51,735
I'm down
to one a day.

00:23:51,801 --> 00:23:53,670
Right after happy hour,
I have my one cigarette,

00:23:53,737 --> 00:23:55,372
and it's out back
by the service register.

00:23:55,438 --> 00:23:56,673
You ask anybody.

00:23:58,541 --> 00:24:00,777
BEZICH:
Drake's telling
the truth, you know?

00:24:00,844 --> 00:24:01,911
He smokes one a day.

00:24:01,978 --> 00:24:03,980
Not on the floor,
right here, my rule.

00:24:04,047 --> 00:24:07,283
Mm-hmm, well, still have
to verify it with evidence.

00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,155
You verify
everything?

00:24:12,222 --> 00:24:15,225
Everything.

00:24:15,291 --> 00:24:17,761
Including you.

00:24:17,827 --> 00:24:20,563
You're clear.

00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:23,967
Can you blame Drake, you know?

00:24:24,034 --> 00:24:26,036
He's trying to give
up cigarettes.

00:24:26,102 --> 00:24:28,204
That's like me
trying to give up...

00:24:28,271 --> 00:24:30,273
Sex?

00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,941
Everybody needs to indulge

00:24:32,008 --> 00:24:34,277
in a vice at least
once a day, right?

00:24:34,344 --> 00:24:36,312
Yes, well, I did
happen to notice

00:24:36,379 --> 00:24:38,548
those little waitress
girlies trying

00:24:38,615 --> 00:24:40,850
to serve their way
into bed with you.

00:24:40,917 --> 00:24:43,086
That's work.

00:24:43,153 --> 00:24:45,288
I prefer women.

00:24:45,355 --> 00:24:48,291
Speaking of work,
do you, um...

00:24:48,358 --> 00:24:50,860
ever get a day off?

00:24:54,064 --> 00:24:55,365
What?

00:24:55,432 --> 00:24:57,600
You want to get
to know me?

00:24:57,667 --> 00:24:59,069
Yes.

00:25:12,482 --> 00:25:13,616
Um...

00:25:13,683 --> 00:25:15,285
What?

00:25:15,352 --> 00:25:16,953
Wait. Hang on.

00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,788
I'm on the clock.

00:25:18,855 --> 00:25:21,658
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:25:21,725 --> 00:25:23,059
You started it.

00:25:23,126 --> 00:25:26,663
Yes, and when the time is right,
maybe I'll finish it.

00:25:29,733 --> 00:25:33,770
( <i>distant siren wails</i> )

00:25:38,575 --> 00:25:39,909
How you feeling?

00:25:39,976 --> 00:25:41,745
Hey. What do you mean?

00:25:41,811 --> 00:25:43,446
Well, you were popping
cough drops at the scene

00:25:43,513 --> 00:25:44,547
the other day
a mile a minute.

00:25:44,614 --> 00:25:46,850
I thought I was coming
down with a cold.

00:25:46,916 --> 00:25:48,518
Ah.

00:25:48,585 --> 00:25:50,653
Yeah, I, uh...

00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,757
I understand colds.

00:25:53,823 --> 00:25:55,925
You know, back in Jersey
when I was getting it

00:25:55,992 --> 00:25:57,260
from both ends,
from my wife

00:25:57,327 --> 00:26:00,296
and my work, things
started to get heavy.

00:26:00,363 --> 00:26:03,199
I started medicating.

00:26:03,266 --> 00:26:05,335
Cure my cold.

00:26:05,402 --> 00:26:08,405
And, um,
and God forbid

00:26:08,471 --> 00:26:10,440
I had an early
morning roll-out

00:26:10,507 --> 00:26:13,910
and I had that tell-tale breath,
you know what I mean?

00:26:13,977 --> 00:26:19,916
So I would dodge my supe, and
I started popping cough drops.

00:26:19,983 --> 00:26:22,285
Huh.

00:26:22,352 --> 00:26:25,422
I mean, what I'm trying
to say is that...

00:26:25,488 --> 00:26:28,024
there's more problems
than answers

00:26:28,091 --> 00:26:30,960
in the bottom of a bottle,
believe me.

00:26:31,027 --> 00:26:33,897
Yeah.
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:26:33,963 --> 00:26:37,367
Actually, I had a couple
of beers with breakfast

00:26:37,434 --> 00:26:40,603
when I got off shift.

00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:43,073
And then I got called in.

00:26:43,139 --> 00:26:45,342
Just a couple?

00:26:45,408 --> 00:26:47,477
Yeah.

00:26:49,512 --> 00:26:50,780
I'm just looking out for you.

00:27:00,557 --> 00:27:02,525
Hey, what are you
doing after work?

00:27:02,592 --> 00:27:04,561
More work.

00:27:04,627 --> 00:27:06,429
You got photos
of Laurel Trents' jewelry, huh?

00:27:06,496 --> 00:27:08,865
Yeah, two-carat
diamond earrings,

00:27:08,932 --> 00:27:12,469
ruby necklace, diamond
and sapphire bracelet,

00:27:12,535 --> 00:27:14,037
lady's gold Rolex.

00:27:14,104 --> 00:27:15,205
The insurance
company says

00:27:15,271 --> 00:27:16,940
it's worth somewhere
north of two mil.

00:27:17,007 --> 00:27:20,043
I got every pawn shop
in town on the lookout.

00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:21,344
What?

00:27:21,411 --> 00:27:23,046
You know that feeling you get

00:27:23,113 --> 00:27:26,282
when you just can't quite
put your finger on something?

00:27:26,349 --> 00:27:27,817
What can't you
put your finger on

00:27:27,884 --> 00:27:29,219
besides the clock-out button?

00:27:29,285 --> 00:27:32,489
Why did they drag his body
down the driveway?

00:27:32,555 --> 00:27:34,157
Dragging's your racket.

00:27:34,224 --> 00:27:35,925
But I can tell you
who's dragging

00:27:35,992 --> 00:27:37,127
Mike Trent
into court.

00:27:37,193 --> 00:27:39,796
His ex-business partner,
Kyle Goode.

00:27:39,863 --> 00:27:41,631
HODGES:
Evidence.

00:27:41,698 --> 00:27:43,800
Evidence in context.

00:27:43,867 --> 00:27:45,168
Take a look.

00:27:48,972 --> 00:27:50,540
Trace on the cigarette butt
is a match

00:27:50,607 --> 00:27:52,308
to the sand I collected
from the ashtray.

00:27:52,375 --> 00:27:53,576
At Acid Drop.

00:27:53,643 --> 00:27:56,312
Now...

00:27:56,379 --> 00:27:58,281
take a look at this.

00:27:58,348 --> 00:28:00,817
I found trace amounts
of soil in the orange seeds

00:28:00,884 --> 00:28:02,052
and the orange peel,

00:28:02,118 --> 00:28:04,020
but not on any
of the butts.

00:28:04,087 --> 00:28:06,890
So it's possible
that the butts were planted.

00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,028
May explain why
there seems to be

00:28:12,095 --> 00:28:13,763
so many suspects
at the crime scene.

00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:15,398
Probably
clears Drake Snow

00:28:15,465 --> 00:28:17,701
and your unidentified
female smoker.

00:28:17,767 --> 00:28:19,035
Where does that leave you?

00:28:19,102 --> 00:28:21,571
With two guys on bikes.

00:28:21,638 --> 00:28:23,273
( <i>gunfire</i> )

00:28:25,375 --> 00:28:26,576
Hit that ninja.

00:28:26,643 --> 00:28:27,844
On the bridge.

00:28:27,911 --> 00:28:28,945
That's it.

00:28:29,012 --> 00:28:30,046
Kyle Goode?

00:28:30,113 --> 00:28:31,114
Uh-huh.

00:28:31,181 --> 00:28:33,917
I'm Detective
Jim Brass, Homicide.

00:28:33,983 --> 00:28:36,519
I was wondering when you
guys would get around to me.

00:28:36,586 --> 00:28:38,221
Why's that?

00:28:38,288 --> 00:28:39,589
My ex-partner's murdered.

00:28:39,656 --> 00:28:42,225
I got a lawsuit against him.
He owes me millions.

00:28:42,292 --> 00:28:43,293
I'd like me for it.

00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,394
Great, then we won't

00:28:44,461 --> 00:28:46,496
have to pull teeth
to get to the truth.

00:28:46,563 --> 00:28:48,264
Where were you
yesterday morning?

00:28:48,331 --> 00:28:50,900
With my son, Alex.

00:28:50,967 --> 00:28:52,569
Where?

00:28:52,635 --> 00:28:54,571
( <i>gunfire</i> )

00:28:54,637 --> 00:28:56,806
You're not going to believe
anything I tell you.

00:28:56,873 --> 00:28:57,807
Why don't you ask him?

00:28:57,874 --> 00:28:59,142
Okay.
Come, Alex.

00:28:59,209 --> 00:29:00,477
Get off the game.

00:29:00,543 --> 00:29:01,611
That's enough.

00:29:01,678 --> 00:29:03,213
You cost me a man.

00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:04,481
I got more quarters.

00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:09,219
So, Alex, where were
you yesterday morning?

00:29:09,285 --> 00:29:10,420
At Grandma's.

00:29:10,487 --> 00:29:12,188
All morning?

00:29:12,255 --> 00:29:13,757
No.

00:29:13,823 --> 00:29:15,325
She lives in Laughlin.

00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,493
My dad drove me.

00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:17,994
What time did
you get there?

00:29:18,061 --> 00:29:19,662
I don't know.
I was sleeping.

00:29:19,729 --> 00:29:21,765
Maybe around... 11:00?

00:29:21,831 --> 00:29:23,333
You sure about that?

00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,335
Yeah.

00:29:25,402 --> 00:29:27,470
When I woke up,
<i>Captain Caveman</i> was on.

00:29:27,537 --> 00:29:29,139
Okay, Laughlin's

00:29:29,205 --> 00:29:30,206
about 21/////2 hours away,

00:29:30,273 --> 00:29:31,975
so you and your son
left home around 8:30?

00:29:32,042 --> 00:29:33,009
More like 8:00.

00:29:33,076 --> 00:29:35,011
Alex likes those
breakfast sandwiches.

00:29:35,078 --> 00:29:36,446
We picked a couple up.
Ate them on the way.

00:29:36,513 --> 00:29:37,881
Where'd you
pick them up?

00:29:37,947 --> 00:29:39,749
Sunny Side's over on Eastern.

00:29:39,816 --> 00:29:41,317
You looking for an alibi?

00:29:41,384 --> 00:29:42,652
Something like that, yeah.

00:29:42,719 --> 00:29:45,188
Come on, Alex. Let's go
over to Circus Circus.

00:29:45,255 --> 00:29:47,157
They got a real arcade.

00:29:59,035 --> 00:30:00,603
Thank you
for visiting Sunny Side's.

00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:02,205
Next in line,
please.
Hi.

00:30:02,272 --> 00:30:03,873
Would you like to try
the Sunny Side's Special?

00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:04,874
No, I'm Nick Stokes.

00:30:04,941 --> 00:30:06,042
I'm with the Las Vegas
Crime Lab.

00:30:06,109 --> 00:30:07,143
Can I talk to you
for a second?

00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:08,478
Um...

00:30:12,148 --> 00:30:14,050
Are you Missy Wilson?

00:30:14,117 --> 00:30:15,819
Are you a truant officer?

00:30:15,885 --> 00:30:16,953
No.

00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:19,889
Your manager said you
were working breakfast

00:30:19,956 --> 00:30:21,191
the other day at
the pick-up window.

00:30:21,257 --> 00:30:22,392
Yeah.

00:30:22,459 --> 00:30:24,828
Do you remember
this guy?

00:30:24,894 --> 00:30:26,896
Oh, my God.

00:30:26,963 --> 00:30:28,398
That's the creep

00:30:28,465 --> 00:30:29,399
who was hitting on me.

00:30:29,466 --> 00:30:31,668
He was so repulsive.
You know what he said to me?

00:30:31,735 --> 00:30:33,303
I'd like to bend you
over the counter,

00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:34,938
baby.

00:30:36,272 --> 00:30:38,074
And he said it
in front of his kid.

00:30:38,141 --> 00:30:39,976
What kind of father
acts like that?

00:30:40,043 --> 00:30:41,845
Sounds like he wanted
to make an impression.

00:30:41,911 --> 00:30:42,846
Oh, he did.

00:30:42,912 --> 00:30:44,014
I hope you're
going to arrest him.

00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,382
One thing at a time.

00:30:45,448 --> 00:30:46,649
Now this window...

00:30:46,716 --> 00:30:47,650
I get all
the creeps

00:30:47,717 --> 00:30:49,652
in drive-through--
teenagers, perverts,

00:30:49,719 --> 00:30:51,821
walk-ups, and those
are my favorites.

00:30:51,888 --> 00:30:52,956
"Hi, I'm on a skateboard.

00:30:53,023 --> 00:30:54,758
Can I have a burger combo?"
"No, dork."

00:30:54,824 --> 00:30:57,227
Does this window have
a surveillance camera?

00:30:57,293 --> 00:30:59,529
Oh, yeah, we have cameras
all over here.

00:30:59,596 --> 00:31:01,131
Even in
the cooler.

00:31:05,235 --> 00:31:06,269
Confirms his alibi.

00:31:06,336 --> 00:31:07,637
Every suspect
Brass leans on

00:31:07,704 --> 00:31:09,673
seems to have a case
of the "airtights."

00:31:09,739 --> 00:31:12,275
Hold it. Run that back.

00:31:16,513 --> 00:31:17,580
Pause it.

00:31:19,416 --> 00:31:21,284
What is that
around the kid's neck?

00:31:21,351 --> 00:31:22,318
I don't know.

00:31:22,385 --> 00:31:23,720
Let's enhance it.

00:31:30,427 --> 00:31:32,996
Almost looks like
a canteen.

00:31:33,063 --> 00:31:35,799
You bring a canteen
up to your lips,

00:31:35,865 --> 00:31:38,068
not to your eyes.

00:31:38,134 --> 00:31:39,703
I'll pull
some stills,

00:31:39,769 --> 00:31:41,304
see what I can make of it.

00:31:41,371 --> 00:31:42,706
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

00:31:42,772 --> 00:31:45,975
AV Lab. Grissom.

00:31:47,711 --> 00:31:49,946
I'll be right there.

00:31:50,013 --> 00:31:53,350
( <i>distant siren blares</i> )

00:31:59,989 --> 00:32:02,625
BRASS:
Well, he lived by the stun,

00:32:02,692 --> 00:32:04,627
but I don't think
he died by it.

00:32:04,694 --> 00:32:05,662
He didn't.

00:32:05,729 --> 00:32:07,597
Uh, two gunshot wounds

00:32:07,664 --> 00:32:09,065
to the back of the head.

00:32:09,132 --> 00:32:10,633
TOD is within the hour.

00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:13,303
GRISSOM:
Blood spatter everywhere.

00:32:15,905 --> 00:32:18,008
Multiple directionalities.

00:32:22,245 --> 00:32:23,446
You almost done, David?

00:32:23,513 --> 00:32:24,748
Uh, yes, sir.

00:32:24,814 --> 00:32:26,316
He's all yours.

00:32:26,383 --> 00:32:27,650
Thanks.

00:32:27,717 --> 00:32:29,552
I want to pick his pockets.

00:32:37,193 --> 00:32:38,862
M...

00:32:38,928 --> 00:32:40,163
and T.

00:32:41,264 --> 00:32:42,966
Doesn't look like Michael Trent.

00:32:43,033 --> 00:32:44,968
If he's one of our bad guys
on the bicycle,

00:32:45,035 --> 00:32:46,002
where's his partner?

00:32:46,069 --> 00:32:48,138
And where's the rest
of the jewelry?

00:32:48,204 --> 00:32:49,639
That's probably what
his partner said

00:32:49,706 --> 00:32:50,840
before he tossed the room.

00:33:04,421 --> 00:33:07,424
( <i>indistinct police radio</i>
<i>chatter</i> )

00:33:52,769 --> 00:33:55,638
Hey, look what I found:

00:33:55,705 --> 00:33:57,207
a knife with blood on it.

00:33:57,273 --> 00:33:59,409
Look what I found:

00:33:59,476 --> 00:34:00,944
a dead guy.

00:34:02,946 --> 00:34:04,581
( <i>police radio chattering</i> )

00:34:04,647 --> 00:34:08,385
Nine-millimeter.

00:34:08,451 --> 00:34:10,987
Pillowcase
full of jewelry.

00:34:14,958 --> 00:34:18,762
Two stacks of $10,000 bricks.

00:34:18,828 --> 00:34:22,565
Well, either they pawned some
diamonds at the US Treasury,

00:34:22,632 --> 00:34:24,634
or they're
on someone's payroll.

00:34:24,701 --> 00:34:26,403
You know what that means:

00:34:26,469 --> 00:34:28,605
hit-for-hire.

00:34:28,672 --> 00:34:32,075
And we're still looking
for somebody.

00:34:34,037 --> 00:34:35,738
Who gets the honors:
him or him?

00:34:35,805 --> 00:34:38,741
Eh, let's start
with Mr. Head Wound.

00:34:38,808 --> 00:34:41,177
You've seen these before.

00:34:41,244 --> 00:34:42,745
Stun gun.

00:34:42,812 --> 00:34:44,347
The debilitator
of choice.

00:34:44,414 --> 00:34:46,416
( <i>zapping, screaming</i> )

00:34:46,482 --> 00:34:49,185
( <i>screaming</i> )

00:34:49,252 --> 00:34:50,687
( <i>gunshots</i> )

00:34:50,753 --> 00:34:53,189
Heard you found a nine-
millimeter at the scene?

00:34:53,256 --> 00:34:55,425
Mm-hmm.
I sent the bullets
to ballistics.

00:34:55,491 --> 00:34:58,428
How about his body?
Any lead in him?

00:34:58,494 --> 00:35:00,964
No, but he took a blade
to the stomach.

00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:02,832
The cut was shallow,

00:35:02,899 --> 00:35:05,735
five or six centimeters
below the sternum.

00:35:05,802 --> 00:35:07,804
Like the soft spot
in a dragon.

00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,442
( <i>screams</i> )

00:35:12,508 --> 00:35:14,544
( <i>screaming</i> )

00:35:14,611 --> 00:35:16,379
Sounds like no honor
among thieves.

00:35:16,446 --> 00:35:19,048
Well, I'll tell you
what they were fighting over.

00:35:19,115 --> 00:35:20,316
The jewelry was hot.

00:35:20,383 --> 00:35:22,385
Either you fence it fast
or eat the loss.

00:35:22,452 --> 00:35:23,686
I'm thinking
more and more

00:35:23,753 --> 00:35:25,154
it was never
part of the plan.

00:35:25,221 --> 00:35:26,623
You know,
you could be right.

00:35:26,689 --> 00:35:28,124
I talked to the Trents' bank.

00:35:28,191 --> 00:35:31,194
They were on their way
to the safety deposit box
that morning

00:35:31,261 --> 00:35:33,563
and then off to Hawaii
at the end of the week.

00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:35,498
So it was Laurel Trent
who cleaned out

00:35:35,565 --> 00:35:36,899
her own jewelry box.

00:35:36,966 --> 00:35:40,937
Yeah. Murder was their wage,
and jewelry was their tip.

00:35:41,004 --> 00:35:43,072
( <i>computer beeping</i> )

00:35:47,043 --> 00:35:48,645
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:35:48,711 --> 00:35:51,147
How's your hands?

00:35:51,214 --> 00:35:53,216
Sore.

00:35:53,283 --> 00:35:54,884
Document every
single bill. Fun.

00:35:54,951 --> 00:35:56,753
I got to hand it
to these casinos.

00:35:56,819 --> 00:35:58,554
They got it all figured out.

00:35:58,621 --> 00:36:01,090
SIDLE:
What do you mean?

00:36:01,157 --> 00:36:03,526
Well, this is
a $10,000 brick, right?

00:36:03,593 --> 00:36:04,928
Mm-hmm.

00:36:04,994 --> 00:36:08,298
I could either lose this
in a hand of blackjack,

00:36:08,364 --> 00:36:10,566
or I could lose cranberry chip.

00:36:10,633 --> 00:36:12,001
What's worse?

00:36:12,068 --> 00:36:14,003
To me, losing's losing.

00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:16,072
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:19,676
Sara?

00:36:19,742 --> 00:36:23,446
I got a bloodstain.

00:36:23,513 --> 00:36:25,648
SANDERS:
You know,
the last time I checked,

00:36:25,715 --> 00:36:28,084
defacing government property
was a federal offense.

00:36:28,151 --> 00:36:31,054
Not when it's logged in
as property, Greg.

00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,589
The blood might be
from a paper cut.

00:36:33,656 --> 00:36:35,725
Okay, but you're my witness.

00:36:40,029 --> 00:36:41,631
Run it against all our players.

00:36:41,698 --> 00:36:42,865
Uh-huh.

00:36:42,932 --> 00:36:45,635
I finished up
on those still photos.

00:36:45,702 --> 00:36:48,771
The canteen around
little Alex's neck...

00:36:48,838 --> 00:36:51,240
is really a set of binoculars.

00:36:53,743 --> 00:36:57,714
If you keep flipping,
it tells the rest of the story.

00:37:02,118 --> 00:37:05,021
Now, call me crazy,

00:37:05,088 --> 00:37:07,423

Nick, would you move about
halfway up the driveway?

Back where Mike Trent was shot?

00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:09,218
Exactly.

00:38:13,823 --> 00:38:15,959
How's this?
Can you see me here?

00:38:16,025 --> 00:38:18,361
No, I can't.

She gave us permission
for a hair sample

they work their way through

the 20K that we found on

What geniuses?
You know,
the brothers,

00:40:25,488 --> 00:40:27,523
who are so cool
and laid back,

00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:29,158
they're in the morgue.

00:40:29,225 --> 00:40:31,194
Oh, what? You didn't
know they're dead?

00:40:31,261 --> 00:40:32,895
Yeah, they greased each
other over the jewelry.

00:40:32,962 --> 00:40:34,230
And that wasn't even
part of the deal

00:40:34,297 --> 00:40:35,298

was it?

And he throws me out?

00:40:57,754 --> 00:41:00,790
Invests our money in clubs
and kicks me out? To do what?

00:41:00,857 --> 00:41:02,792
To ride off into the sunset
with my piece of sushi?

00:41:02,859 --> 00:41:04,193
And it's not just me.

00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:07,230
There's a lot guys out there
got burned by him

00:41:07,297 --> 00:41:08,665
who wouldn't mind
a little revenge.

00:41:08,731 --> 00:41:09,899
I'll even go so far
as to say

00:41:09,966 --> 00:41:11,634
I'm not sorry he's dead,

00:41:11,701 --> 00:41:13,670
or rotting somewhere
in some box.

00:41:18,274 --> 00:41:20,209
But I'll say this for sure:

00:41:20,276 --> 00:41:22,612
I didn't kill him.

00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:24,747
I'm not saying you did.

00:41:24,814 --> 00:41:26,416
Or his wife.

00:41:26,482 --> 00:41:29,085
But your $20,000 incentive
pulled the trigger.

00:41:29,152 --> 00:41:31,254
And you know what--
you won't believe this--

00:41:31,321 --> 00:41:33,423

take a while.

about a verdict anyway,
did you, Kyle?

he screwed up.

Your hatred of Trent

00:42:30,113 --> 00:42:32,849
was stronger than your love
for your own child.

You drugged your son

00:42:36,352 --> 00:42:38,788
so you could use him
as an alibi.

00:42:38,855 --> 00:42:42,458
And that's all a jury's going
to need to hear to convict you.
