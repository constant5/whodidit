00:00:12,872 --> 00:00:14,375
CLAY:
What do you need to get?

00:00:14,442 --> 00:00:16,110
Actually, it's what
you need to get, rook.

00:00:16,177 --> 00:00:18,212
Aw, come on, man.
We're off duty.

00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:21,082
You're off
when I say you're off.

00:00:28,122 --> 00:00:29,190
Don't forget the Ho-Hos.

00:00:48,543 --> 00:00:51,612
Yeah...

00:00:52,647 --> 00:00:54,482
I can help you
over here, sir.

00:00:54,549 --> 00:00:57,051
That's not what
your light says.

00:00:58,386 --> 00:00:59,654
Slow night?

00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,988
Kind of.

00:01:01,055 --> 00:01:05,660
Oh... can't forget
the Ho-Hos.

00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,499
( <i>gun clicks faintly</i> )

00:01:17,672 --> 00:01:20,374
MAN:
What the hell is wrong
with you people?

00:01:20,441 --> 00:01:22,276
My wife is still in there!

00:01:23,311 --> 00:01:25,246
Why isn't anybody
helping my wife?!

00:01:28,749 --> 00:01:30,818
Body count's five.

00:01:47,268 --> 00:01:48,503
Officer Clay
entered the store

00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:50,304
unaware of a robbery
that was in progress.

00:01:50,371 --> 00:01:53,274
Officer Fromansky
came in after he
heard a shot fired.

00:01:53,341 --> 00:01:55,343
Engaged two suspects.

00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:57,011
Lit the place up.

00:02:00,081 --> 00:02:02,917
The ski masks
are John Does.

00:02:02,984 --> 00:02:04,118
The rest

00:02:04,185 --> 00:02:05,987
have wallet IDs.

00:02:13,094 --> 00:02:15,930
Woman at the back
is Julia Reed,

00:02:15,997 --> 00:02:17,832
cocktail waitress
at the Tangiers.

00:02:22,803 --> 00:02:27,608
Man on Aisle Four
is Rufus Sanders,

00:02:27,675 --> 00:02:29,310
cab driver.

00:02:43,257 --> 00:02:45,159
How you want us
to handle this, Grissom?

00:02:46,194 --> 00:02:49,564
Same way you'd eat
an elephant...

00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:53,267
one bite at a time.

00:02:57,872 --> 00:02:59,974
Hey, Jim...

00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:01,375
did you know

00:03:01,442 --> 00:03:05,379
that Charles Manson
is only 5'2"?

00:03:05,446 --> 00:03:07,715
Yeah, little guys tend
to overcompensate.

00:03:07,782 --> 00:03:10,751
Do you remember the, uh, story
about...

00:03:10,818 --> 00:03:13,087
how and where the marshals
found old Charlie

00:03:13,154 --> 00:03:14,589
when they raided
Barker Ranch?

00:03:14,655 --> 00:03:17,592
Yeah. I always, uh...

00:03:17,658 --> 00:03:20,127
I always liked that story.

00:03:26,167 --> 00:03:27,935
We need a medic!

00:03:30,838 --> 00:03:32,440
and Volkswagen.
On the road of life

00:03:32,507 --> 00:03:34,775

I was in my radio car

00:04:08,975 --> 00:04:10,477
when I heard shots fired.

00:04:10,544 --> 00:04:12,913
I called for backup.
I went in.

00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,748
Clay, talk to me.

00:04:14,815 --> 00:04:15,482
Clay!

00:04:15,549 --> 00:04:17,684
( <i>gunfire</i> )

00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:23,490
How many shots you fire?

00:04:23,557 --> 00:04:27,828
Three. No, four. I fired four.

00:04:27,894 --> 00:04:29,863
BRASS:
Then what?
I saw my partner

00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:30,897
on the floor.

00:04:30,964 --> 00:04:32,032
I went towards him.

00:04:32,099 --> 00:04:34,000
<i>Second gunman came at me.</i>

00:04:40,774 --> 00:04:43,710
How many shots you fire
at the second gunman, total?

00:04:44,745 --> 00:04:46,613
Maybe-maybe five.

00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,049
I'd taken a shot
in my vest.

00:04:49,116 --> 00:04:51,518
Hard to count under those
conditions. Are you sure?

00:04:51,585 --> 00:04:53,987
No, I'm not sure.
That's why I said maybe...

00:04:55,889 --> 00:04:57,657
...but I know I shot four
at the third guy.

00:04:57,724 --> 00:04:59,559
I was going to
check on my partner.

00:04:59,626 --> 00:05:01,294
I caught movement in the back.

00:05:01,361 --> 00:05:03,130
Black coat, ski mask, gun...

00:05:03,196 --> 00:05:04,398
I put him down.

00:05:09,269 --> 00:05:10,837
BRASS:
He fire at you?

00:05:10,904 --> 00:05:12,406
Didn't give
him a chance.

00:05:12,472 --> 00:05:13,707
All right, that's
all we need for now.

00:05:13,774 --> 00:05:16,243
I need your weapon.

00:05:17,577 --> 00:05:19,413
My partner...

00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:20,947
I want to be the one
to tell his wife.

00:05:21,014 --> 00:05:22,048
He was my responsibility.

00:05:22,115 --> 00:05:24,050
BRASS:
All right.

00:05:26,219 --> 00:05:28,088
All right, look,

00:05:28,155 --> 00:05:29,990
if you're not going to say it,
I will.

00:05:30,056 --> 00:05:31,658
Fromansky said
he killed three,

00:05:31,725 --> 00:05:34,594
and there are two dead ski masks
in there.

00:05:34,661 --> 00:05:36,430
Now, you
cranked him up

00:05:36,496 --> 00:05:38,231
pretty good on that
vigilante case last year.

00:05:38,298 --> 00:05:39,533
Is that going to be a problem?

00:05:40,567 --> 00:05:42,135
No.

00:05:45,405 --> 00:05:48,341
Everybody, could
I please have
your attention?

00:05:48,408 --> 00:05:49,709
All right, folks, I know

00:05:49,776 --> 00:05:51,912
that you've been through
an awful lot this evening.

00:05:51,978 --> 00:05:53,947
If you could just bear with me
a little longer,

00:05:54,014 --> 00:05:56,583
I need to talk
with every one of
you one at a time,

00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:59,586
so I promise to get
you out of here as
quickly as possible.

00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,189
Is the, uh,

00:06:02,255 --> 00:06:04,724
guy in black the
cocktail waitress'
husband?

00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:07,461
Yeah. Do you
want him first?

00:06:07,527 --> 00:06:09,796
WILLOWS:
I don't think he's
ready for me just yet.

00:06:09,863 --> 00:06:11,431
I'm going to get
to him soon enough.

00:06:24,611 --> 00:06:26,146
What happened
to your assault
in Henderson?

00:06:26,213 --> 00:06:27,748
I closed it.

00:06:27,814 --> 00:06:28,982
Where do you need me?

00:06:29,049 --> 00:06:30,884
There's two more bodies
over by the beer.

00:06:30,951 --> 00:06:33,420
You got it.

00:06:38,992 --> 00:06:40,560
Barely cleared the holster.

00:06:40,627 --> 00:06:42,763
Reflex, maybe. Pulled the
trigger before he had a target.

00:06:42,829 --> 00:06:44,464
( <i>gunshot</i> )

00:06:44,531 --> 00:06:47,200
Not quick enough.

00:06:52,539 --> 00:06:53,907
<i>Those two guys came</i>

00:06:53,974 --> 00:06:56,676
out of nowhere...
made everybody go to the corner.

00:06:56,743 --> 00:06:58,678
Where, specifically?

00:06:58,745 --> 00:07:01,281
Uh... dry goods.

00:07:01,348 --> 00:07:02,616
Then one guy grabs Celeste...

00:07:06,019 --> 00:07:07,287
Which guy?

00:07:07,354 --> 00:07:10,157
I was looking at his piece,
not his face, okay?

00:07:10,223 --> 00:07:11,858
Shotgun or handgun?

00:07:11,925 --> 00:07:15,295
Shotgun. He drags her
over to the registers,

00:07:15,362 --> 00:07:17,264
makes her open 'em up.
She does.

00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:20,000
They're pulling out the cash,
and then he sees

00:07:20,067 --> 00:07:21,468
the cops roll up.

00:07:21,535 --> 00:07:23,470
Second guy says,
"Everybody, get down

00:07:23,537 --> 00:07:25,906
and don't say a freaking word,"
so that's what I did.

00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,308
And then...

00:07:29,342 --> 00:07:30,710
And then?

00:07:30,777 --> 00:07:31,878
( <i>gunshots</i> )

00:07:31,945 --> 00:07:34,448
<i>Ankles and flashes and booms.</i>

00:07:34,514 --> 00:07:37,050
That's all I remember.

00:07:37,117 --> 00:07:39,553
And you never moved
from that spot?

00:07:39,619 --> 00:07:41,855
No, I didn't.

00:07:41,922 --> 00:07:43,690
Do you have somewhere
you need to be?

00:07:47,994 --> 00:07:49,763
I got to change my pants.

00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:54,101
Sorry.

00:08:26,933 --> 00:08:29,736
MAN:
Well, you know, we're not
the most modern store around.

00:08:29,803 --> 00:08:31,805
How long is the
surveillance loop?

00:08:31,872 --> 00:08:33,607
About 24 hours.

00:08:42,849 --> 00:08:45,085
What, uh... what happened
to these tapes here?

00:08:45,152 --> 00:08:46,553
Nothing.

00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,454
These are active cameras,

00:08:47,521 --> 00:08:48,922
right?

00:08:48,989 --> 00:08:50,157
Those VCRs are busted.

00:08:50,223 --> 00:08:51,291
Never got 'em fixed.

00:08:51,358 --> 00:08:53,226
You know, cutbacks.

00:08:53,293 --> 00:08:54,828
Over the register
and outside works.

00:08:54,895 --> 00:08:56,163
That's all we really need.

00:08:56,229 --> 00:08:57,964
Gotta keep an eye on
the employees, right?

00:08:58,031 --> 00:09:01,635
They steal worse
than the customers.

00:09:14,381 --> 00:09:16,116
You know, this guy
hit a $75 jackpot.

00:09:16,183 --> 00:09:17,417
Probably shoving quarters

00:09:17,484 --> 00:09:19,086
in his pockets
when this whole
thing went down.

00:09:19,152 --> 00:09:20,220
The door was 20 feet away.

00:09:20,287 --> 00:09:21,888
He probably could've
made a run for it.

00:09:21,955 --> 00:09:24,391
You know,
after the MGM Grand fire,
they found people fused

00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:25,959
to slot machines.

00:09:26,026 --> 00:09:27,594
Never even made it
out of their seats.

00:09:27,661 --> 00:09:29,429
This guy probably thought
it was his lucky day.

00:09:29,496 --> 00:09:32,365
I'm sure he wasn't going
to leave without his money.

00:09:34,401 --> 00:09:36,970
We all just started running
when those two psychos

00:09:37,037 --> 00:09:39,072
started shooting it out
with the cop...

00:09:39,139 --> 00:09:41,475
( <i>gunshots</i> )

00:09:44,811 --> 00:09:46,213
( <i>screaming</i> )

00:09:48,081 --> 00:09:50,517
I took a first aid course

00:09:50,584 --> 00:09:52,452
about a hundred years ago,

00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:55,322
so I-I-I tried
to keep pressure on the wound,

00:09:55,388 --> 00:09:58,458
<i>but it just kept bleeding,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

00:09:58,525 --> 00:10:02,796
I couldn't leave Rufus
all alone, scared, dying.

00:10:02,863 --> 00:10:04,431
You were friends?

00:10:04,498 --> 00:10:05,999
Mm, sort of.

00:10:06,066 --> 00:10:08,001
He-he'd come in a couple
of times a week

00:10:08,068 --> 00:10:09,536
and play the quarter slots.

00:10:09,603 --> 00:10:11,338
From where you
and Rufus were,

00:10:11,405 --> 00:10:13,440
could you see
Officer Fromansky?

00:10:13,507 --> 00:10:15,342
Oh, the cop who saved us?

00:10:15,409 --> 00:10:18,345
No. I couldn't see anything.

00:10:18,412 --> 00:10:20,213
I just heard
all that gunfire

00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,249
just blasting away.

00:10:57,017 --> 00:10:58,351
Hey.

00:10:58,418 --> 00:11:00,720
Hey.

00:11:00,787 --> 00:11:03,356
Entry wound's
on the left side.

00:11:03,423 --> 00:11:04,991
There's no exit wound?

00:11:21,074 --> 00:11:22,476
Skin's thicker on the back.

00:11:22,542 --> 00:11:23,577
Captured the bullet.

00:11:23,643 --> 00:11:25,612
We'll retrieve it at autopsy.

00:11:27,781 --> 00:11:29,549
<i>I was, uh...</i>

00:11:29,616 --> 00:11:30,684
holding Julia's hand

00:11:30,751 --> 00:11:32,519
trying to find
a place to hide...

00:11:32,586 --> 00:11:33,620
somewhere safe.

00:11:35,388 --> 00:11:39,059
It was those stupid heels,
you know.

00:11:39,126 --> 00:11:41,995
She was always forgetting
to bring her flats to work.

00:11:42,062 --> 00:11:43,764
( <i>automatic gunfire</i> )

00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:45,932
( <i>shotgun cocking and firing)</i>
( <i>single gunshot</i> )

00:11:51,505 --> 00:11:53,073
They didn't have
to shoot her.

00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,441
They were wearing masks.

00:11:54,508 --> 00:11:56,643
We didn't even get
a good look at them.

00:11:56,710 --> 00:12:00,514
Mr. Reed, you can't
look for reasons here.

00:12:02,582 --> 00:12:04,885
We'll have it
out in a second.

00:12:06,219 --> 00:12:09,856
The trick is to apply
even pressure all around.

00:12:11,725 --> 00:12:13,493
Is there something wrong
with tweezers?

00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,163
They can mess up
the striae.

00:12:16,229 --> 00:12:20,133
You've got enough to deal with
without my toolmarks in the mix.

00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,135
Here we go.

00:12:23,737 --> 00:12:25,839
Huh.

00:12:25,906 --> 00:12:27,641
Paper or plastic?

00:12:34,915 --> 00:12:38,018
Officer Clay's
already been processed.

00:12:38,085 --> 00:12:40,554
We wanted to get him
to his family.

00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,456
Did you get prints
off the two suspects?

00:12:42,522 --> 00:12:43,457
Uh, yeah.

00:12:43,523 --> 00:12:45,859
They're right here.

00:12:45,926 --> 00:12:48,995
And we also got bullets
from both of them.

00:12:49,062 --> 00:12:50,263
Good.

00:12:55,102 --> 00:12:57,237
Prison tattoos.

00:12:57,304 --> 00:13:00,240
They weren't virgins.

00:13:02,642 --> 00:13:04,010
Hi, I was wondering

00:13:04,077 --> 00:13:07,080
if I might be able to speak
with Celeste Turner.

00:13:07,147 --> 00:13:08,982
She, uh, has a gunshot wound.

00:13:09,049 --> 00:13:11,818
She was brought in from
the grocery store robbery.

00:13:11,885 --> 00:13:14,221
Right. Curtain Three.

00:13:14,287 --> 00:13:17,090
Just out of surgery.
Stable.

00:13:17,157 --> 00:13:18,959
She's still pretty
doped up, though.

00:13:19,025 --> 00:13:21,094
You're going to have
to come back later.

00:13:21,161 --> 00:13:22,829
You going to need these?

00:13:22,896 --> 00:13:24,731
Yes. Thank you.

00:13:24,798 --> 00:13:27,567
What can you tell me
about the little boy

00:13:27,634 --> 00:13:31,037
who was also brought in
from the robbery incident?

00:13:31,104 --> 00:13:34,074
Minor injuries.
He's fine. Mostly shock.

00:13:34,141 --> 00:13:36,042
He's with his mom.

00:13:36,109 --> 00:13:37,310
Hell of a night, huh?

00:13:37,377 --> 00:13:39,746
Take your kid to work,
both end up shot.

00:13:39,813 --> 00:13:44,084
Wait a minute. So, the little
boy's mother is Celeste Turner?

00:13:44,151 --> 00:13:45,519
Yeah.

00:14:09,309 --> 00:14:12,145
WILLOWS:
Son of a bitch was behind her
the whole time.

00:14:12,212 --> 00:14:13,613
Yeah.

00:14:15,449 --> 00:14:16,483
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,518
Okay, here's what
I got so far...

00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,988
There's our two
DOA suspects.

00:14:22,055 --> 00:14:23,256
Looks like they

00:14:23,323 --> 00:14:25,959
just walked in
off the street.

00:14:27,561 --> 00:14:30,297
WILLOWS:
Is there any sign of Fromansky's

00:14:30,363 --> 00:14:31,364
mystery gunner?

00:14:31,431 --> 00:14:32,599
No. All the cars

00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:34,468
in the parking lot
were accounted for,

00:14:34,534 --> 00:14:36,002
and the loading dock out back

00:14:36,069 --> 00:14:37,270
was deserted,
so...

00:14:37,337 --> 00:14:38,271
( <i>typing</i> )

00:14:38,338 --> 00:14:40,874
This is the only view
of what went down.

00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,814
And see here?

00:14:47,881 --> 00:14:49,483
Here comes our cop.

00:14:49,549 --> 00:14:52,519
Three, four feet away,
doesn't even see him.

00:14:52,586 --> 00:14:56,857
The thing I hate the most
is the bad guys always know

00:14:56,923 --> 00:14:59,426
if there's going to be
a gunfight.

00:15:01,895 --> 00:15:04,297
Officer Clay's one shot
went into the floor.

00:15:04,364 --> 00:15:05,565
The bullet fragmented.

00:15:05,632 --> 00:15:07,667
That's probably how
that kid got hit.

00:15:07,734 --> 00:15:09,269
But Officer
Fromansky's Beretta

00:15:09,336 --> 00:15:10,604
and that suspect's TEC-9,

00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:13,306
they both had hollow
.9 millimeters.

00:15:13,373 --> 00:15:16,209
Between the two of them,
they shot off 18 rounds.

00:15:16,276 --> 00:15:18,245
Shotgun was a Mossberg,
model 500.

00:15:18,311 --> 00:15:19,413
Eight rounds fired.

00:15:19,479 --> 00:15:22,716
Ammo was double-aught buckshot,
nine pellets per shell.

00:15:22,783 --> 00:15:27,387
18 bullets, a total of 26
shells, 72 pellets. Enjoy.

00:15:31,491 --> 00:15:33,060
Firing two shots!

00:16:01,254 --> 00:16:05,392
♪ ♪

00:16:31,184 --> 00:16:35,689
♪ ♪

00:16:56,843 --> 00:16:58,078
Warrick.

00:17:05,051 --> 00:17:07,387
Grissom, we got
a problem.

00:17:07,454 --> 00:17:08,388
Only one?

00:17:08,455 --> 00:17:10,357
We've identified
all the bullets

00:17:10,424 --> 00:17:11,758
recovered
at the scene.

00:17:11,825 --> 00:17:14,161
There's no evidence
of a third gunmen.

00:17:14,227 --> 00:17:15,262
It gets worse.

00:17:15,328 --> 00:17:17,798
The bullet that killed
the cocktail waitress--

00:17:17,864 --> 00:17:19,800
it came from
Fromansky's gun.

00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,901
BRASS:
How you feeling,
Officer?

00:17:25,968 --> 00:17:27,236
Little sore.

00:17:27,302 --> 00:17:30,406
Desk duty hurts
a lot more.

00:17:30,472 --> 00:17:33,642
Is there anything you want
to add to your statement?

00:17:33,709 --> 00:17:37,179
What's he saying
I did this time?

00:17:37,246 --> 00:17:39,915
A bullet from
your gun killed
a cocktail waitress.

00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:43,841
A ricochet.

00:17:43,908 --> 00:17:45,209
GRISSOM:
No.

00:17:45,276 --> 00:17:46,677
A clean shot.

00:17:46,744 --> 00:17:48,146
Not possible.

00:17:48,212 --> 00:17:49,914
BRASS:
No one at the scene

00:17:49,981 --> 00:17:50,915
saw a third gunman.

00:17:50,982 --> 00:17:52,450
I would never shoot
at a civilian.

00:17:52,517 --> 00:17:56,421
I saw a guy wearing a ski mask,
dark coat, holding a gun.

00:17:56,487 --> 00:17:59,390
The girl was wearing a black
sweater, carrying a purse.

00:17:59,457 --> 00:18:00,992
I didn't shoot at that.

00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:02,827
You'd just took a full load
in the chest.

00:18:02,894 --> 00:18:03,928
Maybe you were confused.

00:18:03,995 --> 00:18:05,963
Wasn't confused.

00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:07,498
Your statement says

00:18:07,565 --> 00:18:11,269
that you fired four shots
at this third gunman.

00:18:11,335 --> 00:18:12,270
Yeah.

00:18:12,336 --> 00:18:13,504
Ballistics
evidence

00:18:13,571 --> 00:18:16,274
shows that you spread five shots
over the back wall.

00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,409
So I fired more than I thought.
So what.

00:18:18,476 --> 00:18:20,678
I was engaged with multiple
hostile targets

00:18:20,745 --> 00:18:22,146
You're not back
in the Gulf.

00:18:22,213 --> 00:18:23,147
You're a police officer.

00:18:23,214 --> 00:18:24,782
You're supposed to identify
a target.

00:18:24,849 --> 00:18:26,184
And that's what I did.

00:18:27,552 --> 00:18:30,254
What are you, pissed off
because the last time you tried

00:18:30,321 --> 00:18:31,322
to jam me up
didn't work?

00:18:31,389 --> 00:18:32,356
BRASS:
Hey, ease up.

00:18:32,423 --> 00:18:34,826
What I said in my statement
is the truth.

00:18:34,892 --> 00:18:36,761
The truth is,
we have a dead civilian

00:18:36,828 --> 00:18:38,162
with your bullet in her.

00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:44,302
This going to the next step?

00:18:44,368 --> 00:18:47,472
It has to.

00:18:48,473 --> 00:18:49,974
You're on
administrative
leave

00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:52,477
pending an
IAB review.

00:18:54,879 --> 00:18:58,282
There was no way
I could warn that cop.

00:19:01,753 --> 00:19:03,721
I wanted to...

00:19:03,788 --> 00:19:08,760
but the guy was right there,
under the counter...

00:19:08,826 --> 00:19:11,529
pushing his gun
right into my stomach.

00:19:14,766 --> 00:19:16,367
I'm sorry.

00:19:16,434 --> 00:19:19,237
You're not the one
that pulled the trigger.

00:19:19,303 --> 00:19:21,372
Ms. Turner,

00:19:21,439 --> 00:19:23,775
what was your son
doing there with you?

00:19:23,841 --> 00:19:26,544
Well, my ex was looking
after him that night.

00:19:26,611 --> 00:19:28,112
Then the son of a bitch

00:19:28,179 --> 00:19:30,381
shows up at the store.

00:19:30,448 --> 00:19:32,183
Had a party to go to.

00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:35,053
Practically shoved Henry
out of the car.

00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:36,921
I mean...

00:19:36,988 --> 00:19:40,224
I'm not allowed
to bring kids to work.

00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:43,928
So I snuck Henry
into the office,

00:19:43,995 --> 00:19:46,964
and I told him to stay there.

00:19:47,031 --> 00:19:48,433
Then?

00:19:48,499 --> 00:19:52,437
Then those two maniacs came in.

00:19:52,503 --> 00:19:54,372
They shot that poor policeman.

00:19:59,677 --> 00:20:03,081
And then everything
just went crazy.

00:20:03,147 --> 00:20:05,850
<i>I was running, and I ran to go</i>
<i>find Henry...</i>

00:20:05,917 --> 00:20:08,019
<i>but I couldn't find him</i>
<i>anywhere.</i>

00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,655
Henry!

00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:17,328
That's all I remember.

00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,936
Henry likes his candy,
doesn't he?

00:20:25,002 --> 00:20:28,740
He's got five cavities
to prove it.

00:20:28,806 --> 00:20:30,241
How'd you know?

00:20:30,308 --> 00:20:34,412
Well, we found him in a storage
cabinet, near the candy rack.

00:20:34,479 --> 00:20:37,882
He never listens to me.

00:20:39,684 --> 00:20:41,352
STOKES:
<i>Double counts,</i>

00:20:41,419 --> 00:20:43,688
two people in the
room at all times.

00:20:43,755 --> 00:20:46,357
When you're done, match
the total amounts

00:20:46,424 --> 00:20:48,526
with the register
receipts, okay?

00:20:48,593 --> 00:20:52,697
So, explain to me what all the
money was doing in the registers

00:20:52,764 --> 00:20:55,099
and not the store safe.

00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:58,469
See that light?
It's called a halo.

00:20:58,536 --> 00:21:01,005
It's keyed to the sensor
in the cash register.

00:21:01,072 --> 00:21:03,474
Now, at a preset amount,
that light goes off,

00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:05,109
letting the store
manager know

00:21:05,176 --> 00:21:07,512
it's time to transfer
the cash to the safe.

00:21:07,578 --> 00:21:09,247
Now check this out...

00:21:09,313 --> 00:21:11,582
( <i>typing</i> )

00:21:14,385 --> 00:21:16,187
Most of the halos are lit.

00:21:16,254 --> 00:21:19,357
Maximum cash,
just lying in the drawers.

00:21:19,424 --> 00:21:21,559
So, those guys did
their homework.

00:21:21,626 --> 00:21:24,162
They picked the
perfect time to hit.
Mm-hmm.

00:21:24,228 --> 00:21:28,266
AFIS hits on our suspects,
both just recently released

00:21:28,332 --> 00:21:30,902
from five-year
sentences at Lompoc.

00:21:30,968 --> 00:21:32,270
California boys.

00:21:32,336 --> 00:21:33,604
Born and raised.

00:21:33,671 --> 00:21:35,206
Okay. Let's do this.

00:21:35,273 --> 00:21:36,307
Officer Clay was killed

00:21:36,374 --> 00:21:38,042
by a single close-range
shotgun blast

00:21:38,109 --> 00:21:39,577
to the back of the head.

00:21:39,644 --> 00:21:42,714
Excessive penetration
and laceration of the brain.

00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,749
Suspect Clyde Tremmel...

00:21:44,816 --> 00:21:47,085
The TEC-9 guy.

00:21:47,151 --> 00:21:49,821
Two distant-range,
medium-caliber gunshot wounds

00:21:49,887 --> 00:21:51,355
to the front of the chest,

00:21:51,422 --> 00:21:53,958
with penetration
of the lung and heart.

00:21:54,025 --> 00:21:55,660
Suspect Jack Delver...

00:21:55,727 --> 00:21:57,428
GRISSOM:
Shotgun guy.

00:21:57,495 --> 00:22:00,565
One distant-range,
medium-caliber gunshot wound

00:22:00,631 --> 00:22:02,366
to the forehead.
The bullet

00:22:02,433 --> 00:22:05,937
penetrated the brain and was
recovered in the occipital lobe.

00:22:06,003 --> 00:22:08,372
Rufus Sanders,
bystander...

00:22:08,439 --> 00:22:10,174
Five scattered
buckshot perforations

00:22:10,241 --> 00:22:11,576
on the outer thigh.

00:22:11,642 --> 00:22:14,879
One severed the femoral artery,
resulting in massive hemorrhage.

00:22:14,946 --> 00:22:18,449
And Julia Reed,
cocktail waitress.

00:22:18,516 --> 00:22:21,786
Single medium-caliber gunshot
wound to the left chest.

00:22:21,853 --> 00:22:23,721
The bullet perforated the lung

00:22:23,788 --> 00:22:26,257
and thoracic aorta,
then perforated

00:22:26,324 --> 00:22:28,559
the opposite lung.
And that's it.

00:22:28,626 --> 00:22:30,628
Thanks, Doc.

00:22:37,969 --> 00:22:39,704
Catherine,
something bothering you?

00:22:39,771 --> 00:22:41,906
A little.

00:22:41,973 --> 00:22:44,108
Look, I came here to pick up
my wife's body.

00:22:44,175 --> 00:22:45,777
I already gave you my statement.

00:22:45,843 --> 00:22:47,645
Well, we just need
a few more details

00:22:47,712 --> 00:22:49,280
before we can release the body.

00:22:49,347 --> 00:22:50,948
I promise
this won't be long.

00:22:51,015 --> 00:22:52,350
What?

00:22:52,417 --> 00:22:55,553
Well, you said
that your wife fell
during the gunfight,

00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,321
that that's how
you got separated.

00:22:57,388 --> 00:22:58,489
Yeah.

00:22:58,556 --> 00:23:02,260
Do you recall
exactly how she fell?

00:23:02,326 --> 00:23:03,728
Well, what do you mean?

00:23:03,795 --> 00:23:04,829
How did she land?

00:23:04,896 --> 00:23:09,500
Did she land sideways,
backwards...?

00:23:09,567 --> 00:23:12,003
She fell forward, I think.

00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,237
She fell forward.

00:23:13,304 --> 00:23:15,606
So her hands broke the fall,

00:23:15,673 --> 00:23:17,275
landed on her knees?

00:23:17,341 --> 00:23:18,976
Yeah.

00:23:19,043 --> 00:23:21,145
Well, there weren't
any bruises or scrapes

00:23:21,212 --> 00:23:22,747
on her knees or elbows,

00:23:22,814 --> 00:23:26,317
which is leading me to believe
that she didn't fall.

00:23:26,384 --> 00:23:28,352
Well, what's-what's
the difference?

00:23:28,419 --> 00:23:29,987
She's dead.

00:23:30,054 --> 00:23:32,223
Mr. Reed, there were
a lot of bullets

00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:35,026
flying around that store
and a lot of victims,

00:23:35,093 --> 00:23:38,096
and every detail is important,
but they don't help

00:23:38,162 --> 00:23:39,831
if they're
not accurate.

00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:43,634
Well, when we started running...

00:23:45,336 --> 00:23:46,704
she was right behind me.

00:23:46,771 --> 00:23:48,272
( <i>gunshot and ricochet</i> )

00:23:48,339 --> 00:23:52,543
( <i>five gunshots</i> )

00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:58,416
She froze up.

00:23:58,483 --> 00:24:02,687
Just stood there
looking right at me...

00:24:02,754 --> 00:24:05,323
scared out of her mind.

00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:09,394
I... yelled at her to get down,
to come over to me.

00:24:11,095 --> 00:24:14,298
Sh-She wouldn't move.

00:24:14,365 --> 00:24:17,301
I mean I'm...

00:24:17,368 --> 00:24:20,037
I'm pretty sure I yelled.

00:24:20,104 --> 00:24:21,973
GRISSOM:
Highlight the shots

00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:23,741
that killed the
TEC-9 shooter.

00:24:25,476 --> 00:24:27,378
Fromansky said
that he fired

00:24:27,445 --> 00:24:29,847
three or four shots
at that target.

00:24:29,914 --> 00:24:31,215
He fired four.

00:24:31,282 --> 00:24:32,717
That accounts
for those shots.

00:24:40,625 --> 00:24:44,829
Okay, the guy with the shotgun
was killed with... one bullet.

00:24:44,896 --> 00:24:46,697
Well, those four shots

00:24:46,764 --> 00:24:48,733
were definitely meant for him.

00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,501
But this shot

00:24:50,568 --> 00:24:52,270
is closer to the second gunman

00:24:52,336 --> 00:24:53,771
than it is
to the cocktail waitress.

00:24:53,838 --> 00:24:55,540
Well, Fromansky was turning
when he fired

00:24:55,606 --> 00:24:58,309
so his shots were spread out.

00:25:14,092 --> 00:25:16,127
Okay.

00:25:16,194 --> 00:25:17,729
( <i>typing</i> )

00:25:17,795 --> 00:25:20,498
Which means Fromansky
fired four shots

00:25:20,565 --> 00:25:22,934
at a target
at the back of the store.

00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,635
Just like he said he did.

00:25:24,702 --> 00:25:25,937
Yeah.

00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:31,642
MAN:
<i>At the walk-through</i>

00:25:31,709 --> 00:25:33,778
you said that you saw
a third suspect

00:25:33,845 --> 00:25:35,279
at the back of the store.

00:25:35,346 --> 00:25:37,715
Why did you make
the decision to shoot?

00:25:37,782 --> 00:25:39,817
I was in fear for my life.

00:25:39,884 --> 00:25:41,452
Did you see a weapon?

00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:42,787
Yes.

00:25:42,854 --> 00:25:44,989
What kind?

00:25:45,056 --> 00:25:48,159
A semiautomatic pistol.

00:25:48,226 --> 00:25:50,828
So you fired first.

00:25:50,895 --> 00:25:51,829
Yes.

00:25:51,896 --> 00:25:53,464
Four times.
Yes.

00:25:53,531 --> 00:25:55,600
Can you explain
the lack of evidence

00:25:55,666 --> 00:25:57,568
for a third suspect
at the scene?

00:25:57,635 --> 00:25:59,704
That's not my job.

00:26:02,006 --> 00:26:04,709
Right or wrong,
there'll be guys on the job

00:26:04,776 --> 00:26:06,778
who'll think this was personal.

00:26:06,844 --> 00:26:08,646
They'd be wrong.

00:26:08,713 --> 00:26:12,016
Did you see Julia Reed
in your line of fire?

00:26:12,083 --> 00:26:13,451
No.

00:26:15,486 --> 00:26:18,122
According to Supervising
Criminalist Grissom's report,

00:26:18,189 --> 00:26:20,158
you had an unobstructed view
of Ms. Reed,

00:26:20,224 --> 00:26:23,027
so how do you explain the fact
that you didn't see her?

00:26:25,063 --> 00:26:27,532
I can't.

00:26:27,598 --> 00:26:29,967
You don't deny that a bullet

00:26:30,034 --> 00:26:32,670
from your weapon killed her?

00:26:32,737 --> 00:26:35,840
I'm not denying that.

00:26:35,907 --> 00:26:38,342
But you can't explain it?

00:26:39,377 --> 00:26:42,013
No.

00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,950
Look, your partner was dead.

00:26:46,017 --> 00:26:47,819
You'd been shot.

00:26:47,885 --> 00:26:49,654
You saw someone
you thought was a suspect

00:26:49,721 --> 00:26:51,155
and you fired.

00:26:51,222 --> 00:26:52,690
Under those circumstances,

00:26:52,757 --> 00:26:56,494
any one of us
could make a mistake.

00:26:56,561 --> 00:26:59,063
Did you?

00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:06,604
Officer Fromansky,
answer the question.

00:27:11,476 --> 00:27:13,444
He says yes, he's a bad cop.

00:27:13,511 --> 00:27:17,782
He says no, he's a liar.

00:27:17,849 --> 00:27:22,019
Maybe he really doesn't
know what happened.

00:27:29,041 --> 00:27:30,910
BROWN:
A little over.

00:27:30,976 --> 00:27:33,179
Perfect.

00:27:33,457 --> 00:27:36,060
Let's say I'm Fromansky.

00:27:41,065 --> 00:27:43,267
There's nothing
between Fromansky

00:27:43,334 --> 00:27:44,401
and the cocktail waitress.

00:27:44,468 --> 00:27:46,003
I got a clean view
and a clear shot.

00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,777
GRISSOM:
Hey, take a look at this.

00:27:53,844 --> 00:27:57,715
The cracks in the glass
from shot 22

00:27:57,781 --> 00:28:01,318
are terminated by the
cracks from shot 23.

00:28:01,385 --> 00:28:03,520
( <i>glass shattering</i> )

00:28:10,427 --> 00:28:13,597
So, shot 23 had to occur
before shot 22.

00:28:13,664 --> 00:28:15,733
Which means

00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:18,969
that Fromansky was firing
from left to right,

00:28:19,036 --> 00:28:20,871
not right to left.

00:28:27,478 --> 00:28:30,147
Four shots on a level spread.

00:28:30,214 --> 00:28:32,783
He was shooting
at a moving target.

00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:34,752
According to Catherine's
witness,

00:28:34,818 --> 00:28:36,921
the cocktail waitress
wasn't moving.

00:28:36,987 --> 00:28:38,756
She was a stationary target.

00:28:40,591 --> 00:28:44,061
So, if he was shooting
at a moving target,

00:28:44,128 --> 00:28:46,163
where was it moving to?

00:29:07,384 --> 00:29:09,820
We have the
surveillance tape.

00:29:09,887 --> 00:29:13,390
Shows nothing going
on here before, during

00:29:13,457 --> 00:29:15,025
or after the robbery.

00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:19,463
Well, just because
it shows nothing

00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:22,066
doesn't mean
it's seeing everything.

00:29:24,868 --> 00:29:26,904
BROWN:
You can see me now, right?

00:29:26,971 --> 00:29:28,472
Keep moving to your right.

00:29:28,539 --> 00:29:30,474
All right.

00:29:30,541 --> 00:29:32,142
Keep going.

00:29:32,209 --> 00:29:33,577
I'm still in?

00:29:33,644 --> 00:29:34,812
Keep going.

00:29:34,878 --> 00:29:36,280
Right there.

00:29:36,789 --> 00:29:37,834
NOW you're out.

00:29:54,583 --> 00:29:55,917
Tell me what you see.

00:29:55,984 --> 00:29:58,386
A getaway.

00:29:58,453 --> 00:30:00,555
( <i>metallic scraping</i> )

00:30:04,326 --> 00:30:07,495
We found metal paint
scrapings and skid marks.

00:30:07,562 --> 00:30:08,897
Both recent on
that loading dock.

00:30:08,964 --> 00:30:10,498
These guys definitely
had a wheelman.

00:30:10,565 --> 00:30:13,134
Yeah, guy slips in
after everything gets started.

00:30:13,201 --> 00:30:15,170
During the confusion,
nobody sees him.

00:30:15,237 --> 00:30:17,606
Or no one that was alive
to tell anyway.

00:30:17,672 --> 00:30:19,007
Except Fromansky.
Yeah.

00:30:19,074 --> 00:30:20,976
Well, the suspects knew
there was a blind spot.

00:30:21,042 --> 00:30:22,177
It has to be an inside job.

00:30:22,244 --> 00:30:23,345
Oh, no doubt.

00:30:23,411 --> 00:30:25,313
Matched the cash
from the garbage bag

00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,682
to the register receipts--
$878 was missing.

00:30:27,749 --> 00:30:29,184
Somebody came out ahead.

00:30:29,251 --> 00:30:30,352
Inside guy?

00:30:30,418 --> 00:30:32,621
Well,
I'll run the employees.

00:30:32,687 --> 00:30:35,056
Maybe somebody's
got a record.

00:30:46,801 --> 00:30:49,037
Ran your paint chips
through PPG and DuPont.

00:30:49,104 --> 00:30:50,538
Got a hit.

00:30:50,605 --> 00:30:52,874
Aegean blue Honda Accord.

00:30:52,941 --> 00:30:54,042
Popular color.

00:30:54,109 --> 00:30:55,810
They carried it over
for four years.

00:30:55,877 --> 00:30:56,978
Go figure.

00:30:57,045 --> 00:30:59,648
I'm a teal man myself.

00:30:59,714 --> 00:31:01,716
You?

00:31:03,385 --> 00:31:05,487
Stupid question.

00:31:05,554 --> 00:31:08,657
Anyway, model years
'84 to '87.

00:31:08,723 --> 00:31:10,425
I'll put out a broadcast.

00:31:10,492 --> 00:31:11,493
Thanks, Hodges.

00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,761
Sure.

00:31:18,199 --> 00:31:21,970
Before this goes any deeper,
I want to hear it from you.

00:31:22,037 --> 00:31:24,873
Are you going to try
to screw me on this?

00:31:28,009 --> 00:31:30,478
Well?

00:31:30,545 --> 00:31:33,181
I guess it depends on whether
I get stuck in traffic

00:31:33,248 --> 00:31:34,716
on the way to your hearing.

00:31:45,193 --> 00:31:47,095
BRASS:
So, this car was reported stolen

00:31:47,162 --> 00:31:48,997
about, uh, oh, about
three weeks ago.

00:31:49,064 --> 00:31:50,532
Why don't you take the front.

00:31:50,599 --> 00:31:53,802
I'll take the back.

00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:31,406
pH 13. Sodium hydroxide.

00:32:42,884 --> 00:32:45,387
Got a cell phone.

00:32:45,453 --> 00:32:47,756
There's a lot
of scung on it.

00:32:47,822 --> 00:32:49,724
Won't be too good for prints,

00:32:49,791 --> 00:32:52,060
but let me check
the call history.

00:32:55,096 --> 00:32:57,365
Same number keeps popping up.

00:33:03,171 --> 00:33:05,273
( <i>recording on phone</i> ):
Best Bargain

00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,775
is temporarily closed.

00:33:06,841 --> 00:33:08,677
Please check back tomorrow.

00:33:08,743 --> 00:33:11,680
Well, this is interesting.

00:33:11,746 --> 00:33:13,214
Before the
robbery went down,

00:33:13,281 --> 00:33:15,951
somebody at the
store was very eager

00:33:16,017 --> 00:33:17,986
to talk to our suspects.

00:33:18,053 --> 00:33:19,054
Same number.

00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,288
Yeah?

00:33:21,356 --> 00:33:23,458
Maybe he can tell us who.

00:33:28,029 --> 00:33:29,831
Todd Hallickey.

00:33:29,898 --> 00:33:32,067
Look, I don't know why
you guys brought me here,

00:33:32,133 --> 00:33:34,169
but you got no right
tossing my apartment.

00:33:34,236 --> 00:33:36,204
We matched your prints
from a stolen car

00:33:36,271 --> 00:33:38,073
off the prints
from a prior car theft,

00:33:38,139 --> 00:33:39,407
and bingo, we had a match.

00:33:39,474 --> 00:33:41,109
Got a warrant
for your apartment.

00:33:42,143 --> 00:33:44,646
I don't boost cars no more.

00:33:44,713 --> 00:33:46,948
( <i>chuckles</i> ):
Yeah, right.

00:33:47,015 --> 00:33:48,416
Oh, wait. No, I...

00:33:48,483 --> 00:33:51,453
I was looking into
getting some wheels

00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:53,288
a couple of weeks ago.

00:33:53,355 --> 00:33:54,990
I test-drove this old

00:33:55,056 --> 00:33:57,726
Honda Accord this guy
was trying to unload.

00:33:57,792 --> 00:34:02,230
An '86 Aegean blue
with matching velour interior?

00:34:02,297 --> 00:34:03,598
Yeah, that was it.

00:34:03,665 --> 00:34:05,967
Must be how my print got there.

00:34:06,034 --> 00:34:08,169
Didn't buy the car.

00:34:08,236 --> 00:34:10,405
Guy seemed kind of shady.

00:34:10,472 --> 00:34:13,041
BRASS:
<i>You wouldn't happen</i>
<i>to remember</i>

00:34:13,108 --> 00:34:15,477
<i>this shady guy's name,</i>
<i>would you?</i>

00:34:15,543 --> 00:34:16,811
HALLICKEY:
<i>Come on.</i>

00:34:16,878 --> 00:34:19,648
<i>No one keeps track</i>
<i>of stuff like that.</i>

00:34:19,714 --> 00:34:21,983
<i>Right.</i>

00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:25,153
<i>You own any firearms,</i>
<i>Mr. Hallickey?</i>

00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:26,955
<i>No, sir, I'm on parole.</i>

00:34:27,022 --> 00:34:30,559
<i>Besides, I don't</i>
<i>believe in guns.</i>

00:34:30,625 --> 00:34:32,527
<i>They're dangerous.</i>

00:34:32,594 --> 00:34:34,596
You know, that's a nasty injury
you got there, Todd.

00:34:34,663 --> 00:34:36,298
Looks kind of painful.

00:34:36,364 --> 00:34:37,499
How'd you get it?

00:34:37,566 --> 00:34:38,633
It's a rash.

00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:41,169
Looks like a chemical burn
to me.

00:34:41,236 --> 00:34:43,838
You know
what sodium hydroxide is?

00:34:43,905 --> 00:34:45,507
Never heard of it.

00:34:45,574 --> 00:34:47,609
<i>It's the active ingredient</i>
<i>in drain cleaner.</i>

00:34:47,676 --> 00:34:48,710
<i>It opens up the pipes,</i>

00:34:48,777 --> 00:34:51,913
<i>dissolves flesh</i>
<i>and fabrics.</i>

00:34:57,719 --> 00:34:59,788
Look, you want to
pin that car on me,

00:34:59,854 --> 00:35:02,357
you go ahead and try.

00:35:02,424 --> 00:35:05,360
I got this off the jacket
from your apartment.

00:35:05,427 --> 00:35:07,395
What the hell is this?

00:35:07,462 --> 00:35:08,830
BROWN:
It's a bullet wipe.

00:35:08,897 --> 00:35:11,066
A test for lead.

00:35:14,636 --> 00:35:16,571
Congratulations.

00:35:16,638 --> 00:35:18,373
You passed.

00:35:22,457 --> 00:35:24,092
Hallickey's got no connection

00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:25,160
to the grocery store.

00:35:25,227 --> 00:35:26,361
He was just the wheel man.

00:35:26,428 --> 00:35:28,664
Still, he's looking at four
counts of felony murder.

00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:30,917
But he's not talking.
He lawyered up.

00:35:31,291 --> 00:35:32,592
We got a bullet hole
in a jacket.

00:35:32,659 --> 00:35:34,995
That's not even enough to prove
that he was in the store.

00:35:35,061 --> 00:35:35,996
What about the cash?

00:35:36,062 --> 00:35:36,997
It wasn't in
his apartment.

00:35:37,063 --> 00:35:38,999
Maybe somebody else took it.

00:35:39,065 --> 00:35:40,367
Almost $900 in small bills?

00:35:40,433 --> 00:35:43,103
We'd have noticed pockets
bulging with a wad like that.

00:35:43,169 --> 00:35:45,238
What about
the calls

00:35:45,305 --> 00:35:46,973
from the grocery store
to the suspect's cell?

00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,075
That could have been somebody
giving the "go" signal.

00:35:49,142 --> 00:35:50,877
There's no way to tell who.

00:35:50,944 --> 00:35:53,513
The store runs
off of an old PBX system,

00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,348
and every call that comes in

00:35:55,415 --> 00:35:56,750
goes back to
the same number.

00:35:56,816 --> 00:35:58,351
Every employee
was near a phone,

00:35:58,418 --> 00:35:59,619
so, it could have
been anybody.

00:35:59,686 --> 00:36:00,787
Hey, y'all.

00:36:00,854 --> 00:36:02,889
Ran the criminal records
for the employees.

00:36:02,956 --> 00:36:04,791
Came up with
a Raul Valdez.

00:36:04,858 --> 00:36:05,892
Freight loader.

00:36:05,959 --> 00:36:07,761
He clocked in for
work that night.

00:36:07,827 --> 00:36:09,963
Never clocked out.

00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:13,934
No one by that name
interviewed at the scene?

00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,101
Here's the kicker.

00:36:15,168 --> 00:36:17,003
A few years ago,
he spent some time in prison.

00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:18,772
Lompoc.

00:36:18,838 --> 00:36:22,342
So, Brass is trying
to find him now.

00:37:06,286 --> 00:37:07,887
I got to change my pants.

00:37:33,513 --> 00:37:35,582
You left something
in the store

00:37:35,649 --> 00:37:37,150
besides a
urine stain.

00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:42,155
Just a little
too tempting, huh?

00:37:42,222 --> 00:37:44,324
All that cash
just sitting there

00:37:44,391 --> 00:37:46,526
right in front of your face...

00:37:47,894 --> 00:37:49,195
( <i>gunshot</i> )

00:37:52,632 --> 00:37:55,402
Look, I go to that store
to bag groceries,

00:37:55,468 --> 00:37:57,103
not to get my ass shot off.

00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:59,105
I figure

00:37:59,172 --> 00:38:00,206
I earned the money.

00:38:00,273 --> 00:38:01,675
Kind of like working overtime.

00:38:01,741 --> 00:38:03,944
Might as well get something
for all your trouble, right?

00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:05,946
Considering the fact that
your nice little robbery

00:38:06,012 --> 00:38:07,047
had gone straight to hell.

00:38:07,113 --> 00:38:08,782
Whoa, wait a minute.

00:38:08,848 --> 00:38:09,916
You think...?

00:38:09,983 --> 00:38:11,051
No way.

00:38:11,117 --> 00:38:12,752
It was an inside job.

00:38:12,819 --> 00:38:14,621
You knew the
registers were full.

00:38:14,688 --> 00:38:17,090
Those gunmen had help
from an employee.

00:38:17,157 --> 00:38:18,858
Not from me, they didn't.

00:38:18,925 --> 00:38:20,460
Look, you want to bust me
for the money,

00:38:20,527 --> 00:38:23,463
go ahead, I took it.

00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:25,966
But I did not set the thing up.

00:38:37,344 --> 00:38:39,946
You know, Hodges
already analyzed

00:38:40,013 --> 00:38:41,047
trace on
the bullets.

00:38:41,114 --> 00:38:43,083
Yeah, I wanted
to take a look myself.

00:38:43,149 --> 00:38:45,585
He'll take it personally.

00:38:45,652 --> 00:38:46,987
Good.

00:38:50,924 --> 00:38:55,629
The report says that the
cocktail waitress was wearing

00:38:55,695 --> 00:38:56,896
a black wool sweater.

00:38:56,963 --> 00:38:58,064
Was she also

00:38:58,131 --> 00:39:00,100
wearing something polyester?

00:39:00,166 --> 00:39:02,102
No.

00:39:02,168 --> 00:39:04,804
Take a look at this.

00:39:09,075 --> 00:39:11,011
WARRICK:
Black fibers.

00:39:11,077 --> 00:39:13,980
Probably synthetic.

00:39:14,047 --> 00:39:16,149
Mixed in with the wool.

00:39:18,551 --> 00:39:23,490
If their gunman was wearing
a black polyester jacket...

00:39:23,556 --> 00:39:27,861
Fromansky claims that he was
tunnel-visioned on the gunman.

00:39:27,928 --> 00:39:30,030
So, it's possible

00:39:30,096 --> 00:39:33,133
that he never even saw
the cocktail waitress.

00:39:49,182 --> 00:39:52,385
You may have just
saved Fromansky's ass.

00:39:54,554 --> 00:39:56,856
Hey, Catherine, how'd
it go with the bag boy?

00:39:56,923 --> 00:39:58,558
He admitted to swiping the cash,

00:39:58,625 --> 00:40:00,393
but he wouldn't cop
to the robbery.

00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:02,329
Then I have something
you should see.

00:40:02,395 --> 00:40:04,831
I was going back through
the surveillance tapes

00:40:04,898 --> 00:40:07,801
covering the loading dock,
thinking I might find someone

00:40:07,867 --> 00:40:10,303
scouting a blind spot,
you know?

00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:13,673
But instead,
I found this.

00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:17,510
Two nights before
the robbery.

00:40:17,577 --> 00:40:20,146
There.

00:40:20,213 --> 00:40:21,247
See that?

00:40:21,314 --> 00:40:23,516
One more time.

00:40:26,052 --> 00:40:30,490
STOKES:
That camera's stationary, so...

00:40:30,557 --> 00:40:33,159
Somebody moved the camera.

00:40:35,929 --> 00:40:38,431
You used to part-time
at the Forum shops.

00:40:38,498 --> 00:40:40,934
We got your prints
off your work card.

00:40:41,001 --> 00:40:43,103
It was the same print
that we got

00:40:43,169 --> 00:40:45,905
off the loading dock
surveillance camera.

00:40:52,512 --> 00:40:55,682
Raul Valdez,
an ex-con--

00:40:55,749 --> 00:40:57,217
your co-worker.

00:40:57,284 --> 00:40:59,586
You got him
to give you the names

00:40:59,653 --> 00:41:01,621
of some guys to do the job.

00:41:01,688 --> 00:41:05,892
You give them the best time
to hit the registers.

00:41:05,959 --> 00:41:08,328
You tell them
where to park.

00:41:08,395 --> 00:41:10,497
It's a good plan.

00:41:10,563 --> 00:41:12,198
Until your ex
showed up

00:41:12,265 --> 00:41:14,200
and leaves you
with your kid.

00:41:14,267 --> 00:41:16,369
Then you panic,
and you call your guys,

00:41:16,436 --> 00:41:17,470
try to call it off,

00:41:17,537 --> 00:41:19,039
but they
won't listen.

00:41:19,105 --> 00:41:20,807
If that's
what happened,

00:41:20,874 --> 00:41:23,977
that could go in your favor.

00:41:24,044 --> 00:41:25,211
When we find Raul,

00:41:25,278 --> 00:41:26,880
he'll give you up
in a heartbeat.

00:41:26,947 --> 00:41:29,816
I think I need to get a lawyer.

00:41:29,883 --> 00:41:31,051
What you need

00:41:31,117 --> 00:41:32,552
is come clean and cooperate.

00:41:32,619 --> 00:41:34,087
And you better hope and pray

00:41:34,154 --> 00:41:36,623
the DA doesn't want
to put a needle in your arm

00:41:36,690 --> 00:41:38,892
for killing five people,
including a cop.

00:41:43,763 --> 00:41:48,401
I have been working
at that store for five years.

00:41:48,468 --> 00:41:51,371
38 hours a week.

00:41:51,438 --> 00:41:56,343
38... not 40.

00:41:56,409 --> 00:41:58,411
You know why?

00:41:58,478 --> 00:41:59,913
Because my manager

00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:02,015
won't give me
enough hours

00:42:02,082 --> 00:42:05,352
to qualify for benefits.

00:42:09,089 --> 00:42:11,358
I have a kid...

00:42:11,424 --> 00:42:14,361
with rotten teeth.

00:42:19,299 --> 00:42:22,802
I never meant
for anybody to get hurt.

00:42:22,869 --> 00:42:25,705
( <i>sniffling</i> )

00:42:31,811 --> 00:42:33,713
<i>Officer Fromansky,</i>

00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:35,215
if you could smile,
please?

00:42:35,282 --> 00:42:36,750
Thank you;
right over here.

00:42:36,816 --> 00:42:38,685
BRASS:
Guy from
the mayor's office.

00:42:38,752 --> 00:42:40,620
Fromansky's getting
a commendation.

00:42:40,687 --> 00:42:42,022
What do you think?

00:42:42,088 --> 00:42:44,691
Two dead felons,
two dead civilians

00:42:44,758 --> 00:42:46,192
a dead policeman...

00:42:46,259 --> 00:42:48,061
I don't know
what to think.
