WILLOWS:
Hey, Jim!

00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,614
We got a call.

00:00:51,681 --> 00:00:53,282
A possible 4-19.

00:00:53,349 --> 00:00:55,318
Is there a dead body or not?

00:00:55,384 --> 00:00:58,988
That arm crash-landed
on the windshield of the car.

00:00:59,055 --> 00:01:01,991
According to the driver,
it shot out from under the bus.

00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,061
Generally speaking,

00:01:05,127 --> 00:01:07,163
where there's an arm,
there's a body.

00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:09,332
What say we check out the bus?

00:01:09,398 --> 00:01:11,434
Good call.

00:01:12,602 --> 00:01:14,237
Now, the, uh, passengers

00:01:14,303 --> 00:01:16,572
were on their way to
St. Matthew's Church in Pioche.

00:01:16,639 --> 00:01:18,674
They were from
a work release program

00:01:18,741 --> 00:01:20,042
at Nevada Correctional
Institution.

00:01:20,109 --> 00:01:22,745
Okay, well, I got some blood
on the wheel well.

00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:29,952
Oh, yeah, that's a
definite on the 4-19.

00:01:30,987 --> 00:01:35,391
Um, well... appears
to be female.

00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:36,659
Caucasian.

I dissected her arm.

The blood in the brachial
artery is clotted,

of a post-mortem

Given the depth

of the, uh, fracture,
I'd say she was hit on
the head with something

and white and fuzzy

Sure. I'll start her bath.

Baby Girl--
was that a street name?

Yes. That's what
everyone called her.

00:08:31,884 --> 00:08:33,051
Christine?

00:08:33,118 --> 00:08:34,520

we got on the bus.

I didn't hardly know Baby Girl.

00:08:49,067 --> 00:08:50,903
She only lived up
in here eight days.

00:08:50,969 --> 00:08:52,504
Eight days?

00:08:52,571 --> 00:08:54,072
In this cell.

00:08:54,139 --> 00:08:57,543
Few weeks ago, I found her
smuggling contraband.

00:08:57,609 --> 00:09:00,012
It was just a silver necklace.

00:09:00,078 --> 00:09:02,014
Inmates aren't allowed jewelry.

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,683
It wasn't a major infraction,
but I transferred her cell.

I could've told you that.

00:09:40,752 --> 00:09:42,287
Warden,

00:09:42,354 --> 00:09:44,056
could you show us
where the bus was parked

00:09:44,122 --> 00:09:45,924
before it left the facility?

00:09:45,991 --> 00:09:48,060
The bus was stationed
right here.

00:09:48,126 --> 00:09:49,561
Are you the only driver?

00:09:49,628 --> 00:09:50,729
Only bus driver.

00:09:50,796 --> 00:09:53,398

Officer, before you drove

00:09:57,536 --> 00:09:59,404
out of here,
did you inspect the vehicle?

00:09:59,471 --> 00:10:01,039
Miss... Sidle,

00:10:01,106 --> 00:10:02,074
I don't get time

00:10:02,141 --> 00:10:03,075
to scratch my ass.

00:10:03,142 --> 00:10:04,409
I haven't had a

00:10:06,211 --> 00:10:09,148
Now, usually, I work the road,
and when the warden asks,

00:10:09,214 --> 00:10:10,749

That's reality.

00:10:22,995 --> 00:10:25,597
No sign of a struggle,
no evidence of a body drag.

00:10:25,664 --> 00:10:28,066
If the attack didn't happen
in her cell or in here,

00:10:28,133 --> 00:10:30,068
maybe it happened
on the bus.

00:10:30,135 --> 00:10:32,738
SIDLE:
Who maintains
your transpo fleet?

00:10:32,804 --> 00:10:34,239
Fleet?
We got three antique buses.

00:10:34,306 --> 00:10:35,774
Inmates do
all the work.

00:10:35,841 --> 00:10:38,210
You allow inmates to service
your prison vehicles?

00:10:38,277 --> 00:10:39,478
You bet.

00:10:39,545 --> 00:10:43,048
On Saturday, I even bring in
my SUV.

00:10:43,115 --> 00:10:44,917
Juanita washes it.

00:10:44,983 --> 00:10:46,819
Ain't that right,
Juana?

00:10:46,885 --> 00:10:49,955
I've got to get something
on top of my $11.65 an hour.

00:10:50,022 --> 00:10:53,158
Look, we're in the middle
of the desert.

00:10:53,225 --> 00:10:56,061
We're a hundred miles
from the pit of nowhere.

00:10:56,128 --> 00:10:57,229
Is that gate always unlocked?

00:10:57,296 --> 00:10:59,298
It's not like someone's going
to hot-wire the bus

00:10:59,364 --> 00:11:00,699
and hightail it
out of here.

00:11:00,766 --> 00:11:02,267
Right, so essentially anyone

00:11:02,334 --> 00:11:03,836
in the prison population
could have walked

00:11:03,902 --> 00:11:04,937
into the garage,
onto the bus

00:11:05,003 --> 00:11:06,338
and no one would
have said boo?

00:11:06,405 --> 00:11:08,040
Boo.

Hey, we were canvassing
the area

00:12:36,929 --> 00:12:38,263
when Mr. Samuels showed up.

00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:39,998
He says he's the tenant's
guardian.

00:12:40,065 --> 00:12:40,999
He's got questions.

00:12:41,066 --> 00:12:42,501
So do I.

00:12:42,568 --> 00:12:44,903
Mr. Samuels,
I'm Warrick Brown.

I'm from the Crime Lab.

00:12:46,405 --> 00:12:47,840
What happened to Zero?

00:12:47,906 --> 00:12:49,908
There's crime tape
on his door.

00:12:49,975 --> 00:12:51,777
These guys won't let me in.

00:12:51,844 --> 00:12:52,945
His brother was murdered.

00:12:53,011 --> 00:12:54,213
Adanto.

00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:55,514
Did you know him?

00:12:55,581 --> 00:12:57,749
Yeah, I've known them both
since they were kids.

00:12:57,816 --> 00:12:59,918
Frank...

00:12:59,985 --> 00:13:01,420
Zero.

00:13:01,487 --> 00:13:02,988
I'm so sorry.

00:13:05,591 --> 00:13:07,092
I'm sorry.

00:13:27,513 --> 00:13:29,148
Absorption.

00:13:31,183 --> 00:13:33,085
Blood?

00:13:33,152 --> 00:13:36,321
Yeah, and it's more
than just a paper cut.

00:13:36,388 --> 00:13:37,289
I'll swab it for DNA.

00:13:47,866 --> 00:13:49,668
Florescence.

00:13:49,735 --> 00:13:51,770
Bluish-white.

00:14:06,552 --> 00:14:09,988
Acid phosphatase tests positive.

00:14:10,055 --> 00:14:11,523
What is semen doing

00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:13,992
in the back
of a female prison bus?

00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:21,959
FRANK:
It's okay, Zero.

00:14:22,026 --> 00:14:23,661
Just answer the questions.

00:14:26,931 --> 00:14:28,366
I said I was sorry

00:14:28,432 --> 00:14:30,768
'cause I'm not supposed
to be out by myself.

00:14:30,835 --> 00:14:32,270
So, why did you go out?

00:14:34,305 --> 00:14:37,608
Well, I came home
from special school,

00:14:37,675 --> 00:14:40,444
I found Adanto in the kitchen.

00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:46,917
I love you,
I love you Adanto.

00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:51,853
When was the last time
you talked to your brother?

00:14:55,332 --> 00:14:57,333
Just before school.

00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,968
What I'm about
to tell you,

00:14:59,035 --> 00:15:00,570
you can't tell anybody.

00:15:00,636 --> 00:15:02,371
No. No, I won't.

00:15:02,438 --> 00:15:03,873
Scout's honor.

00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,875
We're going to be rich

00:15:05,942 --> 00:15:07,743
like we always talked about.

00:15:12,081 --> 00:15:13,349
I love you, kid.

00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:15,551
I love you, too.

00:15:15,618 --> 00:15:18,554
Said he was going to
buy me a shiny new car

00:15:18,621 --> 00:15:20,223
and a driver to take me

00:15:20,289 --> 00:15:23,292
anywhere I wanted to go.

00:15:25,328 --> 00:15:29,966
He said we were
going to be rich.

00:15:37,974 --> 00:15:40,076
I'm sure she'll be happy

00:15:41,444 --> 00:15:42,912
Juanita?

00:15:42,979 --> 00:15:46,582
Do you recall the last time
that you washed out

00:15:46,649 --> 00:15:47,917
the interior of the bus?

00:15:47,984 --> 00:15:50,386
Yesterday, a few hours
before we left for work release.

00:15:50,453 --> 00:15:52,054
If something's missing,
it wasn't me.

00:15:52,121 --> 00:15:54,557
You can check my locker.

00:15:54,624 --> 00:15:57,093
Did you notice
anything unusual

00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,694
in the back of the bus?

00:15:58,761 --> 00:16:00,029
Like what?

00:16:00,096 --> 00:16:03,499
Blood or... semen?

00:16:03,566 --> 00:16:06,569
Didn't see any blood.

00:16:06,636 --> 00:16:07,637
What about semen?

00:16:07,703 --> 00:16:08,704
Don't they still do it

00:16:08,771 --> 00:16:10,039
in the backseat
in the free world?

00:16:10,106 --> 00:16:12,408
Yeah.

00:16:12,475 --> 00:16:13,910
But I doubt

00:16:13,976 --> 00:16:16,746
if conjugal visits are permitted

00:16:16,813 --> 00:16:18,047
in a prison bus.

00:16:18,114 --> 00:16:20,283
Conjugal visits
aren't permitted anywhere.

00:16:20,349 --> 00:16:22,718
The ACLU was going
to bring a case that's...

00:16:29,692 --> 00:16:31,761
The only men permitted in
this correctional facility

00:16:31,828 --> 00:16:33,229
are the correctional officers.

00:16:33,296 --> 00:16:35,231
It's a Class "D" felony

00:16:35,298 --> 00:16:39,335
for a CO to have sexual contact
with an inmate.

00:16:39,402 --> 00:16:41,204
Lots of things
are felonies,

00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,939
but people still do them.

00:16:43,005 --> 00:16:45,341
Otherwise, you and
I'd be out of a job.

00:16:47,944 --> 00:16:50,580
HODGES:
The white fibers
from the head wound

00:16:50,646 --> 00:16:52,415
were straight out
of any Wal-Market.

00:16:52,482 --> 00:16:54,083
78% cotton, 14% polyester

00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,618
and seven percent
nylon elastic.

00:16:55,685 --> 00:16:57,787
Sounds like we're looking for

00:16:57,854 --> 00:16:59,922
a lethal pair
of white underpants.

00:16:59,989 --> 00:17:03,259
Yeah, or a bra,
pair of socks.

00:17:03,326 --> 00:17:06,262
The skin discoloration,
that was a real challenge.

00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:07,997
You know, uh,
on her forearm.

00:17:08,064 --> 00:17:09,465
Looked like a birthmark.

00:17:09,532 --> 00:17:10,833
Yeah, that skin sample

00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,102
was supposed to be
sent to Histology.

00:17:13,169 --> 00:17:15,204
Yeah, well,
they kicked it back to me.

00:17:15,271 --> 00:17:18,875
Uh, the coloration
was an adulterant.

00:17:18,941 --> 00:17:20,543
Aluminum chelate
of carminic acid.

00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:21,944
Aluminum ch...?

00:17:22,011 --> 00:17:23,779
I've never heard of this before.

00:17:23,846 --> 00:17:24,480
It's a cochineal.

00:17:24,547 --> 00:17:25,448
A what?

00:17:25,515 --> 00:17:26,549
A cochineal.

00:17:26,616 --> 00:17:27,717
They're scaled insects.

00:17:27,783 --> 00:17:29,485
Carminic acid
is found in their intestines.

00:17:29,552 --> 00:17:32,155
<i>It's bitter,</i>
<i>so it discourages predators.</i>

00:17:32,221 --> 00:17:35,024
As a dye,
it's been prized for centuries.

00:17:35,091 --> 00:17:37,326
Since when did you become
an insects expert?

00:17:37,393 --> 00:17:39,295
Entomology textbook.

00:17:39,362 --> 00:17:40,463
Grissom gave it to me
last Christmas.

00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:41,497
When I can't sleep, I read.

00:17:41,564 --> 00:17:44,567
Funny, I didn't get a
Christmas gift from Grissom.

00:17:44,634 --> 00:17:45,735
Did you?

00:17:45,802 --> 00:17:47,303
No.

00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:50,006
Uh, so, assuming that she
was tattooed in prison,

00:17:50,072 --> 00:17:52,308
how'd she get a hold
of the bugs?

00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:55,211
Well, um, cochineals feed
on cactus plants.

00:17:55,278 --> 00:17:58,147
They probably grow wild
in the prison yard.

00:17:58,214 --> 00:18:00,950
SIDLE:
<i>Baby Girl could've</i>
<i>smashed up a few bugs,</i>

00:18:01,017 --> 00:18:04,320
<i>used the carminic acid</i>
<i>to tattoo herself.</i>

00:18:04,387 --> 00:18:06,088
Do you have a photo
of the tattoo?

00:18:06,155 --> 00:18:08,257
Yeah.

00:18:13,963 --> 00:18:16,566
STOKES:
Looks like a half moon.

00:18:16,632 --> 00:18:18,100
Gang moniker, maybe.

00:18:18,167 --> 00:18:20,369
Every woman knows what that is.

00:18:20,436 --> 00:18:22,038
It's a heart.

00:18:22,104 --> 00:18:24,106
Well, half a heart.

00:18:25,675 --> 00:18:27,844
Oh.

00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:29,212
Yeah.

00:18:29,278 --> 00:18:31,080
Where's the other half?

00:18:35,818 --> 00:18:36,986
BROWN:
Mr. Samuels,

00:18:37,053 --> 00:18:39,255
we found your
prints on the knife

00:18:39,322 --> 00:18:40,756
used to kill Adanto Adams.

00:18:40,823 --> 00:18:41,757
Now, wait a minute.

00:18:41,824 --> 00:18:42,925
I didn't stab Adanto.

00:18:42,992 --> 00:18:44,227
Oh, my God.

00:18:44,293 --> 00:18:45,361
Zero?!

00:18:45,428 --> 00:18:46,863
Zero?!

00:18:46,929 --> 00:18:49,065
( <i>grunts</i> )

00:18:49,131 --> 00:18:51,434
But you didn't call 911.

00:18:51,501 --> 00:18:52,568
Or the police.

00:18:52,635 --> 00:18:53,903
You just took off?

00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,438
That's a felony.

00:18:55,505 --> 00:18:57,507
Look, I was concerned
about Zero.

00:18:57,573 --> 00:19:00,143
He's a nine-year-old kid
in a man's body.

00:19:00,209 --> 00:19:02,245
I didn't know
if he did it.

00:19:02,311 --> 00:19:03,679
Zero's like a son to me.

00:19:03,746 --> 00:19:05,982
I've been his guardian
since he was 14.

00:19:06,048 --> 00:19:07,817
Everybody used
to make fun of him.

00:19:07,884 --> 00:19:09,418
Called him "Zero."

00:19:09,485 --> 00:19:12,321
I told him only special people
get nicknames.

00:19:12,388 --> 00:19:14,357
Where's his parents now?

00:19:14,423 --> 00:19:16,526
They passed away.

00:19:16,592 --> 00:19:19,562
He left a small inheritance
for his boys...

00:19:19,629 --> 00:19:21,030
Zero doesn't spend much.

00:19:21,097 --> 00:19:25,368
Okay, I'll ask again.

00:19:25,434 --> 00:19:28,004
You found the body

00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:29,272
and then you went to work?

00:19:29,338 --> 00:19:31,407
I just needed
some time to think.

00:19:31,474 --> 00:19:33,242
Well, you'll get
plenty of that now.

00:19:33,309 --> 00:19:35,278
24 hours in a holding cell.

00:19:35,344 --> 00:19:36,846
Come on. Let's go.

00:19:36,913 --> 00:19:38,581
ROBBINS:
It's very peculiar.

00:19:38,648 --> 00:19:40,550
Take a look
at his chest wound.

00:19:40,616 --> 00:19:42,552
No right or left angulation.

00:19:42,618 --> 00:19:43,886
No up or down.

00:19:43,953 --> 00:19:45,254
Straight in, straight out.

00:19:45,321 --> 00:19:47,390
GRISSOM:
Well, the crime scene suggests

00:19:47,456 --> 00:19:50,426
he was moving around his
apartment while being stabbed

00:19:50,493 --> 00:19:52,195
so, "straight in, straight out"
doesn't seem likely.

00:19:52,261 --> 00:19:54,230
Well, one time
is an anomaly.

00:19:54,297 --> 00:19:55,965
Five times?

00:19:56,032 --> 00:19:59,769
All four back wounds
are clustered and parallel.

00:19:59,836 --> 00:20:01,971
And the chest wound
is at the same distance

00:20:02,038 --> 00:20:04,340
from the crown of his head
as the other four.

00:20:04,407 --> 00:20:06,542
What about defensive wounds?

00:20:06,609 --> 00:20:07,643
There are none.

00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,347
Okay, so, he's running around
his apartment

00:20:11,414 --> 00:20:12,815
trying to get away
from his attacker

00:20:12,882 --> 00:20:14,150
and he incurs no nicks or cuts?

00:20:14,217 --> 00:20:15,651
Nope.

00:20:17,687 --> 00:20:19,088
What else?

00:20:19,155 --> 00:20:21,157
Well, I found this
in his stomach.

00:20:21,224 --> 00:20:23,559
Looks like a paper wad
of some sort.

00:20:25,261 --> 00:20:28,865
Maybe a treasure map.

Good thing this guy's not
concerned with his cholesterol.

00:20:34,237 --> 00:20:35,838
He ate fatty foods.

00:20:35,905 --> 00:20:38,474
Paper's pretty well preserved.

00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:42,545
Uh, most of the ink
is washed off.

00:20:42,612 --> 00:20:44,714
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

Uh... "P-A... L..."

00:21:14,277 --> 00:21:17,346
Oh, The Palms.

00:21:17,413 --> 00:21:19,715
I know what this is.

00:21:19,782 --> 00:21:23,719
It's a receipt for a marker.

00:21:23,786 --> 00:21:25,655
For ten grand.

MAN:
Oh, yeah, that's him.

00:21:29,392 --> 00:21:30,593
Adanto Adams.

00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,695
Said he wanted to play BJ
in the no-limit area.

00:21:32,762 --> 00:21:34,864
So I had the cage check
his credit.

00:21:34,931 --> 00:21:36,032
Qualified for ten grand.

00:21:36,098 --> 00:21:38,201
Thank you.

00:21:38,267 --> 00:21:39,368
And I wrote him up.

00:21:39,435 --> 00:21:40,803
Did he have some kind
of a system?

00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:42,071
They all got systems.

00:21:42,138 --> 00:21:43,105
This one was
a small-time

00:21:43,172 --> 00:21:44,106
double-up
type thing.

00:21:44,173 --> 00:21:45,274
Bet 100, lose;
bet 200, lose.

00:21:45,341 --> 00:21:46,442
Bet four, lose.

00:21:46,509 --> 00:21:48,244
Double-up-till-
you-win type thing.

00:21:55,051 --> 00:21:57,753
Now, don't you get anything
other than a 20?

00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:58,988
Hmm?

00:21:59,055 --> 00:22:00,590
( <i>bangs table</i> )

00:22:00,656 --> 00:22:02,592
The one thing
about systems in this town--

00:22:02,658 --> 00:22:05,094
if you got one,
we want you here.

00:22:05,161 --> 00:22:06,762
Can I get a copy
of that footage?

00:22:06,829 --> 00:22:08,764
Listen, you look familiar.

00:22:08,831 --> 00:22:10,166
I seen you before?

00:22:10,233 --> 00:22:11,734
You been in here?

00:22:11,801 --> 00:22:13,736
Maybe just on a case.

00:22:13,803 --> 00:22:15,972
How about that footage?

00:22:17,006 --> 00:22:19,041
Hey, got your page.
What's up?

00:22:19,108 --> 00:22:20,776
Oh, the warden
faxed over

00:22:20,843 --> 00:22:23,079
Baby Girl's
commissary purchases.

00:22:23,146 --> 00:22:25,681
She bought one 20-count
box of tampons

00:22:25,748 --> 00:22:27,650
every month
like clockwork,

00:22:27,717 --> 00:22:30,620
but check out
the last few months.

00:22:30,686 --> 00:22:31,988
What are you thinking?

00:22:32,054 --> 00:22:35,191
She might not have needed
any for, oh, nine months?

00:22:35,258 --> 00:22:37,460
I think Baby Girl
was having a baby.

00:22:41,931 --> 00:22:44,267
Skull's not ready yet.

00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:46,969
Enzymes are still eating away
at the proteins.

00:22:47,036 --> 00:22:50,239
Did you, by any chance,
do a pregnancy test

00:22:50,306 --> 00:22:51,574
on Baby Girl?

00:22:51,641 --> 00:22:53,776
I thought
she'd been incarcerated

00:22:53,843 --> 00:22:55,645
for the last 23 months.

00:22:55,711 --> 00:22:57,180
She had been.

00:23:06,823 --> 00:23:10,193
Urine...

00:23:10,259 --> 00:23:11,127
you're out.

00:23:12,428 --> 00:23:14,363
Okay...

00:23:17,133 --> 00:23:18,668
Home pregnancy test?

00:23:18,734 --> 00:23:20,536
About ten times cheaper

00:23:20,603 --> 00:23:24,841
than the brand sold
by <i>our</i> medical supply company,

00:23:24,907 --> 00:23:26,909

Eye on the
bottom line.

00:23:29,412 --> 00:23:30,913
I find that very...

00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,114
Sexy?

00:23:32,181 --> 00:23:33,516
Prudent.

00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:35,852
But that was a good try.

00:23:35,918 --> 00:23:39,388
Yeah, plus sign.

00:23:39,455 --> 00:23:40,690
You know what that means.

00:23:40,756 --> 00:23:43,226
Who's your daddy?

00:23:47,248 --> 00:23:48,382
Archie?

00:23:48,449 --> 00:23:49,617
Hey.

00:23:49,684 --> 00:23:51,819
Got your surveillance tape
of Zero's brother.

00:23:51,886 --> 00:23:53,821
Roll it.

00:23:53,888 --> 00:23:57,058
Now, according
to the pit boss,

00:23:57,125 --> 00:23:58,726
the kid was playing
a double-up system.

00:23:58,793 --> 00:23:59,827
What I want to know is,

00:23:59,894 --> 00:24:01,462
how many hands did
he back himself up?

00:24:01,529 --> 00:24:02,563
Let's find out.

00:24:07,135 --> 00:24:09,237
First hand,

00:24:09,303 --> 00:24:11,205
hundred.
Loser.

00:24:11,272 --> 00:24:13,341
Second hand,

00:24:13,408 --> 00:24:15,343
200.

00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:17,078
Lose.

00:24:17,145 --> 00:24:18,379
Third hand,

00:24:18,446 --> 00:24:20,348
400. Lose.

00:24:21,949 --> 00:24:24,152
$800.

00:24:24,218 --> 00:24:26,487
So he's doubling
every bet.

00:24:26,554 --> 00:24:29,857
Yeah, that's the classic
double-up system.

00:24:33,628 --> 00:24:35,630
Go back out wide.

00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:40,568
Looks like
he's all in.

00:24:40,635 --> 00:24:44,138
Tenth bet, $51,200.

00:24:46,407 --> 00:24:48,342
Adanto has 20.

00:24:48,409 --> 00:24:49,343
He sticks.

00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:50,645
She has two up.

00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,081
Another two, and

00:24:53,147 --> 00:24:54,682
that's four.

00:24:54,749 --> 00:24:55,683
Two, three, two.

00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:56,751
That's 11.

00:24:56,818 --> 00:25:00,088
Ace, ace, ace, ace.

00:25:00,154 --> 00:25:02,423
Fifteen.

00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:04,058
Six.

00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:07,128
Ten-card

00:25:07,195 --> 00:25:08,296
21.

00:25:08,362 --> 00:25:10,064
What are the odds of that?

00:25:10,131 --> 00:25:12,400
The record's an 11-card 21.

00:25:12,467 --> 00:25:14,435
That was back in '78.

00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:17,405
So he loses

00:25:17,472 --> 00:25:20,141
$102,300 in ten hands.

00:25:20,208 --> 00:25:21,976
What's the $10,000 marker for?

00:25:25,012 --> 00:25:27,115
Try to chase back the 102.

00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:40,628
He lost it all.

00:25:47,301 --> 00:25:50,171
He swallowed his loss.

00:26:04,986 --> 00:26:07,655
that is nothing more
than a wild goose chase.

00:26:07,722 --> 00:26:09,057
We have probable cause
to believe

00:26:09,123 --> 00:26:10,825
that a correctional officer
was involved

00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:14,062
Involved
in getting her pregnant, maybe,

00:26:14,128 --> 00:26:15,663
but that's a far cry
from homicide.

Nevertheless,
as you pointed out,

00:26:18,199 --> 00:26:21,602
sex with an inmate is a crime.

consistent with

00:28:44,145 --> 00:28:45,313
Not a surprise.

I thought he was talking
about free car washes.

00:29:24,619 --> 00:29:27,121
There's no evidence
of anti- or paramortem rape.

00:29:27,188 --> 00:29:28,523
He'll claim
it was consensual.

00:29:28,589 --> 00:29:29,757
It's still rape.

00:29:29,824 --> 00:29:32,060
Under color
of authority.

00:29:32,126 --> 00:29:34,062
She swore
she couldn't have kids.

00:29:34,128 --> 00:29:36,664
Too many turns
at the coat hanger.

00:29:38,366 --> 00:29:39,967
Her words.

00:29:40,034 --> 00:29:41,702
Yeah.

00:29:41,769 --> 00:29:44,338
I imagine
that you were pissed off

00:29:44,405 --> 00:29:46,340
when she broke
the news.

00:29:46,407 --> 00:29:49,811
It kind of changes
the power dynamics.

00:29:49,877 --> 00:29:51,813
STOKES:
And she blabs
to the warden.

00:29:51,879 --> 00:29:54,348
He's demoted from
officer to inmate.

00:29:54,415 --> 00:29:56,918
That is motive.

00:29:56,984 --> 00:29:58,786
I swear, I had no idea.

00:29:58,853 --> 00:30:00,154
Doug, let me handle this.

00:30:00,221 --> 00:30:01,923
If the DA had
sufficient evidence

00:30:01,989 --> 00:30:04,125
to file murder charges,
he would have.

00:30:04,192 --> 00:30:06,961
Well, your client's already
been charged with a felony.

00:30:07,028 --> 00:30:08,262
DA has all the
time in the world.

00:30:08,329 --> 00:30:09,597
Look, I can't fight
the evidence.

00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:11,332
Doug, Doug, would you be quiet?

00:30:11,399 --> 00:30:12,767
Look, I got her pregnant.

00:30:12,834 --> 00:30:14,235
I admit it.

00:30:14,302 --> 00:30:15,503
I'll do the time, okay?

00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:17,138
But you can't prove
that I killed her

00:30:17,205 --> 00:30:18,506
because I didn't.

00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:27,460
How's the knife
handle coming?

00:30:27,527 --> 00:30:28,661
Handled.

00:30:28,728 --> 00:30:30,230
The substance
Grissom scraped off

00:30:30,296 --> 00:30:33,867
was interior latex house paint
with titanium dioxide.

00:30:33,933 --> 00:30:35,401
That would be
glossy, right?

00:30:35,468 --> 00:30:36,836
Mm-hmm.

00:30:36,903 --> 00:30:38,638
What's house paint doing
on a knife handle?

00:30:38,705 --> 00:30:40,473
1984, William Bergstrom asked

00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:42,942
old man Binion if he could come
into his casino and bet

00:30:43,009 --> 00:30:45,478
a million dollars
on one roll of craps.

00:30:45,545 --> 00:30:47,914
That November,
he put a briefcase full

00:30:47,981 --> 00:30:51,317
of $1 million
on the "don't pass" line,

00:30:51,384 --> 00:30:52,585
rolled a seven
on the come-up.

00:30:52,652 --> 00:30:53,586
Loser.

00:30:53,653 --> 00:30:54,687
Soon after that,

00:30:54,754 --> 00:30:56,356
he killed himself.

00:30:56,422 --> 00:30:57,924
So, what are you getting at?

00:30:57,991 --> 00:30:59,959
If the wounds couldn't
have been made

00:31:00,026 --> 00:31:01,161
by a handheld knife,

00:31:01,227 --> 00:31:03,163
maybe the knife
wasn't handheld.

00:31:03,229 --> 00:31:04,764
How else are you going
to stab a guy?

00:31:04,831 --> 00:31:07,767
Well, put the evidence aside
for a second.

00:31:07,834 --> 00:31:10,136
What was Adanto's state of mind?

00:31:10,203 --> 00:31:11,905
You've had
a few bad runs.

00:31:11,971 --> 00:31:13,273
Guy comes into town,

00:31:13,339 --> 00:31:15,408
convinces his brother to invest

00:31:15,475 --> 00:31:17,610
in some two-bit
double-up system,

00:31:17,677 --> 00:31:20,480
ends up losing
his life savings

00:31:20,547 --> 00:31:23,016
in a ten-card 21.

00:31:23,082 --> 00:31:25,151
In a word: desperate.

00:31:25,218 --> 00:31:28,555
So put that into context
with your evidence.

00:31:32,025 --> 00:31:34,194
Greg.

00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,795
Do you think
skin cells can survive

00:31:35,862 --> 00:31:37,297
50 miles

00:31:37,363 --> 00:31:39,065
of rough desert road?

00:31:39,132 --> 00:31:40,366
That's what I asked you.

00:31:40,433 --> 00:31:42,235
I analyzed every strip

00:31:42,302 --> 00:31:44,404
of fabric from
the bus' chassis.

00:31:44,471 --> 00:31:45,705
Zilch.

00:31:45,772 --> 00:31:47,707
But I'm a guy who likes
to tie up loose ends,

00:31:47,774 --> 00:31:49,776
so I asked Doc Robbins
to send over the scraps

00:31:49,843 --> 00:31:51,244
that were tied
to the body parts.

00:31:51,311 --> 00:31:52,479
That's where
I found them.

00:31:52,545 --> 00:31:53,546
Fresh,

00:31:53,613 --> 00:31:55,548
abraded epithelials.

00:31:59,886 --> 00:32:01,754
So, if the epithelial DNA
matches

00:32:01,821 --> 00:32:02,922
the bus driver,
this case

00:32:02,989 --> 00:32:03,556
is closed.

00:32:03,623 --> 00:32:04,757
One problem.

00:32:04,824 --> 00:32:05,558
Double "X"

00:32:05,625 --> 00:32:06,526
marks the spot.

00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,695
It's female DNA?

00:32:08,762 --> 00:32:10,096
Well, I guess

00:32:10,163 --> 00:32:11,598
we're looking at an inmate.

00:32:11,664 --> 00:32:13,166
Or female staff.

00:32:13,233 --> 00:32:14,834
Excuse me. Am
I interrupting?

00:32:14,901 --> 00:32:16,503
Oh, not if

00:32:16,569 --> 00:32:18,404
the vic's skull
is in that bag.

00:32:18,471 --> 00:32:21,374
Alas, poor Yorick.

00:32:21,441 --> 00:32:22,542
I knew him, Horatio.

00:32:25,011 --> 00:32:26,546
The occipital bone

00:32:26,613 --> 00:32:30,617
retained the shape
of the murder weapon.

00:32:44,597 --> 00:32:46,633
Desperation.

00:33:01,347 --> 00:33:04,984
( <i>gasping softly</i> )

00:33:29,576 --> 00:33:30,743
<i>No way we can lose.</i>

00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:33,113
( <i>voices overlapping</i> )

00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:35,615
<i>This is Vegas.</i>
<i>Anything can happen.</i>

00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:39,018
( <i>grunting</i> )

00:33:39,085 --> 00:33:42,856
( <i>shouting</i> )

00:33:52,766 --> 00:33:55,335
<i>I found a way</i>
<i>to make us some money.</i>

00:33:56,903 --> 00:33:59,839
<i>We're going to be rich</i>
<i>like we always talked about.</i>

00:33:59,906 --> 00:34:01,674
<i>I love you, kid.</i>

00:34:01,741 --> 00:34:03,877
<i>I love you, too.</i>

00:34:06,246 --> 00:34:07,180
( <i>grunts</i> )

00:34:09,849 --> 00:34:12,585
He killed himself?

00:34:14,087 --> 00:34:16,322
I'm afraid so.

00:34:19,592 --> 00:34:22,462
No. Why would he do that?

00:34:22,529 --> 00:34:24,364
Your brother took out
an insurance policy

00:34:24,431 --> 00:34:26,232
with an accidental death clause.

00:34:29,269 --> 00:34:30,837
It means that
if he was murdered,

00:34:30,904 --> 00:34:34,040
the beneficiary would be
entitled to a million dollars.

00:34:34,107 --> 00:34:35,608
You're the beneficiary.

00:34:36,643 --> 00:34:39,846
Unfortunately, the coroner
is going to rule

00:34:39,913 --> 00:34:41,548
the case a suicide...

00:34:41,614 --> 00:34:43,883
and not a homicide,

00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:46,186
which makes that policy
worthless.

00:34:46,252 --> 00:34:49,289
I-I was just trying to help
my brother.

00:34:51,291 --> 00:34:54,194
Oh... I want Frank.

00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,528
Listen to me.

00:34:55,595 --> 00:34:57,897
Frank will be facing charges
of obstructing justice.

00:34:57,964 --> 00:34:58,898
Do you understand?

00:34:58,965 --> 00:35:01,167
The court will appoint you
another guardian.

00:35:01,234 --> 00:35:02,836
No, I don't want
another guardian.

00:35:02,902 --> 00:35:04,471
I want Frank!

00:35:05,972 --> 00:35:07,807
( <i>whimpers</i> )

00:35:08,842 --> 00:35:11,744
I'm sorry.

00:35:26,493 --> 00:35:30,396
STOKES:
This program is scanning
the topography of the skull

00:35:30,463 --> 00:35:33,867
and building a three-dimensional
image based on the data.

00:35:33,933 --> 00:35:36,870
It should be done in a second,

00:35:36,936 --> 00:35:40,039
but you can already see
two concentric arcs.

00:35:40,106 --> 00:35:41,441
Inner arc is impressed

00:35:41,508 --> 00:35:44,778
just a little bit deeper
into the skull.

00:35:44,844 --> 00:35:46,146
Check it out.

00:35:46,212 --> 00:35:48,047
Like a crater in a crater.
Yeah.

00:35:48,114 --> 00:35:50,316
Can you enlarge to full screen?

00:35:55,388 --> 00:35:57,557
There.

00:35:58,792 --> 00:36:02,328
Small... evenly spaced
indentations

00:36:02,395 --> 00:36:04,330
on the edge of the inner arc.

00:36:04,397 --> 00:36:05,932
I know what that is.

00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,108
Skinny-ass
feather worth

00:36:15,175 --> 00:36:16,776
as much trouble dead
as she was alive?

00:36:16,843 --> 00:36:18,411
I didn't ask her

00:36:18,478 --> 00:36:20,180
to move in here.
No one asked you.

00:36:25,752 --> 00:36:27,454
So, Warden,

00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,555
Baby Girl was
transferred

00:36:28,621 --> 00:36:29,856
to this cell
about a week ago?

00:36:29,923 --> 00:36:31,357
That's right.

00:36:31,424 --> 00:36:33,026
Where was she
last housed?

00:36:33,092 --> 00:36:34,527
"D" block.

00:36:51,845 --> 00:36:53,012
White fibers.

00:36:58,384 --> 00:37:00,820
Warden,

00:37:00,887 --> 00:37:03,957
how often do the inmates
have their laundry washed?

00:37:04,023 --> 00:37:06,993
Twice a week:
one day for colors,
one day for whites.

00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,762
Tomorrow's a white day.

00:37:12,899 --> 00:37:16,069
You don't mind if I empty out
your laundry bag, do you?

00:37:28,581 --> 00:37:31,551
Juanita, would you remove
your shoes, please?

00:37:33,419 --> 00:37:35,555
WARDEN:
Now.

00:37:45,465 --> 00:37:46,966
The other.

00:38:11,891 --> 00:38:15,895
A lock in a sock.

00:38:22,235 --> 00:38:24,704
Juanita, I read
your rap sheet.

00:38:24,771 --> 00:38:28,875
Possession
with intent to sell.

00:38:28,942 --> 00:38:33,580
Your old man was
using you as a
drug meal, right?

00:38:35,915 --> 00:38:38,318
He was supposed to protect me.

00:38:39,352 --> 00:38:41,621
He said if I got caught,
he'd take

00:38:41,688 --> 00:38:44,591
the fall.

00:38:44,657 --> 00:38:48,094
After the raid,
he disappeared.

00:38:49,129 --> 00:38:51,364
Vanished.

00:38:51,431 --> 00:38:54,200
I get locked up.

00:38:54,267 --> 00:38:55,668
I should've known better.

00:38:58,204 --> 00:39:00,173
( <i>sighs</i> ):
Well...

00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,075
my ex drained

00:39:02,142 --> 00:39:03,476
my bank account.

00:39:03,543 --> 00:39:05,278
I was saving up for
this nice little house

00:39:05,345 --> 00:39:09,182
for my daughter and me, and...

00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:14,420
As soon as you let 'em in, huh?

00:39:25,665 --> 00:39:27,333
Gets lonely in
prison, doesn't it?

00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:31,571
Was it the first time
you had a relationship
with a woman?

00:39:32,605 --> 00:39:34,207
Tattoo.

00:39:34,274 --> 00:39:35,842
Baby Girl had

00:39:35,909 --> 00:39:37,277
the other half.

00:39:37,343 --> 00:39:40,013
I'm not... like that.

00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:42,515
It wouldn't be the
first time to cross

00:39:42,582 --> 00:39:44,150
gender lines
in search of some...

00:39:44,217 --> 00:39:46,352
affection.

00:39:46,419 --> 00:39:50,690
It was the first time
I felt that way about anyone.

00:39:50,757 --> 00:39:52,826
And Baby Girl
ended up pregnant.

00:39:52,892 --> 00:39:55,195
It's not like she could hide
that from you.

00:39:55,261 --> 00:39:57,230
She said
she had the flu.

00:39:57,297 --> 00:39:59,232
Yeah, right.

00:39:59,299 --> 00:40:02,302
( <i>gagging</i> )
That's what you get
for lying to me,

00:40:02,368 --> 00:40:04,170
for sneaking around.

00:40:04,237 --> 00:40:06,539
I was just playing him, Juana.

00:40:06,606 --> 00:40:08,241
I was doing it for us.

00:40:08,308 --> 00:40:09,876
You're a liar!

00:40:09,943 --> 00:40:11,744
Want to know
the truth, Juanita?

00:40:11,811 --> 00:40:15,515
In one month,
I am out of this hole...

00:40:15,582 --> 00:40:17,650
and away from you.

00:40:17,717 --> 00:40:21,821
And then, later that night,
she said she was sorry,

00:40:21,888 --> 00:40:24,691
and we made up.

00:40:24,757 --> 00:40:25,692
The next day,

00:40:25,758 --> 00:40:28,728
she got the warden
to transfer her...

00:40:28,795 --> 00:40:30,597
out of our cell.

00:40:30,663 --> 00:40:33,533
She wasn't playing Doug.

00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,502
She was playing me.

00:40:35,568 --> 00:40:37,270
So you killed her?

00:40:37,337 --> 00:40:40,306
She promised to end it
with Doug.

00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:46,479
( <i>moaning</i> )

00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,495
( <i>screams</i> )

00:41:13,807 --> 00:41:17,210
You tied her body to the
undercarriage of the bus

00:41:17,277 --> 00:41:19,546
and assumed we'd
think that she died

00:41:19,612 --> 00:41:23,183
while attempting to escape...
right?

00:41:24,217 --> 00:41:27,387
If there's one thing I learned
in prison...

00:41:27,454 --> 00:41:30,723
it's to stick up for myself...

00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:33,660
because nobody else will.

00:41:35,628 --> 00:41:37,564
I think that you should know

00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:40,266
that Baby Girl was telling
the truth

00:41:40,333 --> 00:41:41,267
about the transfer.

00:41:41,334 --> 00:41:42,569
It wasn't her request.

00:41:42,635 --> 00:41:43,770
It was Warden Hutton's

00:41:43,837 --> 00:41:46,473
decision.

00:41:46,539 --> 00:41:48,608
She was caught

00:41:48,675 --> 00:41:50,410
trying to smuggle
in this necklace

00:41:50,477 --> 00:41:53,580
and was reprimanded.

00:41:53,646 --> 00:41:55,448
I'm guessing it was

00:41:55,515 --> 00:41:57,016
for you.
