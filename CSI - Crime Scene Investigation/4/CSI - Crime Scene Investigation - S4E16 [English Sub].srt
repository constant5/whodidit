There's a small cut

00:02:56,705 --> 00:02:58,106
Yeah, it looks like
he's wearing makeup.

Yes.

00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,768

I want you to outline each
individual stain with dots.

But keep them at least
an eighth of an inch

00:11:39,428 --> 00:11:40,762
Bring me some stuff!

00:11:45,267 --> 00:11:47,002
What are you two ladies
lookin' at?

00:11:47,069 --> 00:11:50,639
Uh... Jamal...

00:11:50,706 --> 00:11:53,008
We're with the Las
Vegas Crime Lab.

00:11:53,075 --> 00:11:56,645
It seems you were driving
a dead man's car

00:11:56,712 --> 00:11:59,248
when you got
in your accident.

00:11:59,314 --> 00:12:01,583
Half the peoples I know be dead.

00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:04,419
It don't mean they can't own
a vehicle.

00:12:04,486 --> 00:12:06,521
Hey, Vanilla Ice...

00:12:06,588 --> 00:12:09,258
at this point you're lookin'
at a murder rap,

00:12:09,324 --> 00:12:11,326
which may end you up
on death row,

00:12:11,393 --> 00:12:13,996
and I'm not talking
about the record label.

00:12:14,062 --> 00:12:15,998
Nurse, this be cruel
and unusual!

00:12:16,064 --> 00:12:17,833
GRISSOM:
Look, pal,
right now

00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,101
the evidence tells us

00:12:19,167 --> 00:12:22,204
that you killed the man
whose car you were driving.

00:12:22,271 --> 00:12:23,839
You want to explain that?

00:12:23,906 --> 00:12:25,507
Explain what, B?

00:12:25,574 --> 00:12:29,578
I was laid up shootin'
speedballs all day.

00:12:29,645 --> 00:12:31,713
Look, man,
when I get off,

00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,282
I'm gone.

00:12:33,348 --> 00:12:34,449
Feel me?

00:12:34,516 --> 00:12:37,419
I can't see nothin',
I can't hear nothin'.

00:12:37,486 --> 00:12:41,356
Wherever high is, that's where
I take the elevator up.

00:12:41,423 --> 00:12:43,091
Oh, you damn cow!

00:12:43,158 --> 00:12:44,793
Took you long enough.

00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:48,363
When I call you, you
come, you understand me?

00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:50,699
Why you got to
do me like this?

00:12:50,766 --> 00:12:53,869
That's right.

00:12:53,936 --> 00:12:55,137
Man's dead.

00:12:55,204 --> 00:12:58,040
What difference it make
how he got there?

00:12:58,106 --> 00:13:03,478
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I got a date with Mrs. Jones.

00:13:05,847 --> 00:13:08,483
Man's already dead.

00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:11,787
Why he be needing shoes, anyway?

00:13:11,853 --> 00:13:13,889
Was that a confession?

00:13:13,956 --> 00:13:16,158
I think a plea of insanity.

00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:40,709
DNA results on the blood
from Jamal's clothes.

00:13:40,776 --> 00:13:41,877
It's his own.

00:13:41,944 --> 00:13:43,946
Well, the blood spatter's
consistent

00:13:44,013 --> 00:13:45,548
with a front-end collision.

00:13:45,614 --> 00:13:47,349
So he didn't kill him
in the car.

00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:49,118
Doesn't mean
he didn't kill him.

00:13:49,185 --> 00:13:52,188
What I want to know is how's
a strung-out junkie like Jamal

00:13:52,254 --> 00:13:54,557
get a guy out of the car
with just his knife?

00:13:54,623 --> 00:13:57,393
Yeah, and why stab him
six times?

00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,261
Well, let's just say
for argument's sake

00:13:59,328 --> 00:14:00,830
that Jamal is telling the truth

00:14:00,896 --> 00:14:02,398
and that Burnell
was already dead

00:14:02,465 --> 00:14:04,633
when he took his wallet,
his shoes and his car.

00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,837
Well, if the motive wasn't
robbery... what was it?

00:14:16,178 --> 00:14:18,814
Maybe this'll tell us.

00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:42,271
Heroin?

00:14:42,338 --> 00:14:45,174
Negative
on marquis-mecke-froede.

00:14:45,241 --> 00:14:47,009
So, if it's not an opiate,
what is it?

00:14:47,076 --> 00:14:48,010
I don't know.

00:14:48,077 --> 00:14:48,944
I've never seen it before.

00:14:49,011 --> 00:14:50,079
I ran a color and crystal test.

00:14:50,146 --> 00:14:51,147
Take a look.

00:14:54,884 --> 00:14:57,753
All I can tell you is
it's an indole alkaloid.

00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,822
Did you run it
through the GCMS?

00:14:59,889 --> 00:15:02,792
Yeah, but it's not
in the library.

00:15:12,368 --> 00:15:14,770
( <i>computer beeps</i> )

00:15:46,268 --> 00:15:48,504
( <i>computer beeps</i> )

00:16:10,659 --> 00:16:12,161
WEEN:
<i>That's Doodles.</i>

00:16:12,228 --> 00:16:14,029
A.K.A. Donny Zanko.

00:16:14,096 --> 00:16:15,064
So you know him.

00:16:15,131 --> 00:16:16,999
There are two kinds
of clowns:

00:16:17,066 --> 00:16:18,834
There's your ex-circus pros,

00:16:18,901 --> 00:16:21,937
washed out of Ringling Bros.,
Barnum and Bailey,

00:16:22,004 --> 00:16:24,607
and then there's your basic
chuckleheads.

00:16:24,673 --> 00:16:26,675
Which kind was Doodles?

00:16:26,742 --> 00:16:28,410
Basic chucklehead.

00:16:28,477 --> 00:16:30,179
You know, buy a getup,

00:16:30,246 --> 00:16:32,848
learn some tricks,
and grab some scratch

00:16:32,915 --> 00:16:35,384
boring the crap
out of nine-year-olds.

00:16:35,451 --> 00:16:39,054
He was a good birthday man,
except when he, uh...

00:16:39,121 --> 00:16:40,990
So, he made money boring kids?

00:16:41,056 --> 00:16:42,424
Parents throw parties.

00:16:42,491 --> 00:16:46,695
They like clowns because they
think their kids like clowns.

00:16:46,762 --> 00:16:47,863
Mm-hmm.

00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:50,533
Lindsey's fourth... Bad scene.

00:16:50,599 --> 00:16:51,600
Oh.

00:16:51,667 --> 00:16:55,371
So, what was the last gig
you booked for him?

00:16:55,437 --> 00:16:58,073
Uh...
Car wash, couple of weeks back.

00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,074
Why?

00:16:59,141 --> 00:17:01,410
Mr. Ween, he's been dead
less than 48 hours

00:17:01,477 --> 00:17:04,046
and he was wearing his makeup
when he was killed.

00:17:04,113 --> 00:17:05,648
That son of a bitch.

00:17:05,714 --> 00:17:07,783
He was working
off the books.

00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:10,152
I never thought Doodles
would try to stiff me.

00:17:10,219 --> 00:17:12,488
He, actually, was the one
who got stiffed.

00:17:19,061 --> 00:17:21,997
So, it turns out Burnell's
tox report was clean.

00:17:22,064 --> 00:17:25,468
Not only that, he
works at some sort
of recovery center.

00:17:25,534 --> 00:17:26,969
Well, that makes sense.

00:17:27,036 --> 00:17:28,170
It does?

00:17:28,237 --> 00:17:32,141
Well, the substance we found
in his car was ibogaine.

00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:33,943
What's that, the stuff
that grows hair?

00:17:34,009 --> 00:17:36,378
A choline-esterase inhibitor

00:17:36,445 --> 00:17:41,083
that acts as a stimulant
in the central nervous system.

00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:44,887
In the liver, it converts
to an active metabolite...

00:17:44,954 --> 00:17:45,988
Noribogaine.

00:17:46,055 --> 00:17:49,058
Noribogaine locks
onto addiction receptors...

00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:52,761
blocking the feedback loops
that reinforce dependency.

00:17:52,828 --> 00:17:53,896
In human speak?

00:17:53,963 --> 00:17:56,332
Well, apparently,
in some cases,

00:17:56,398 --> 00:17:59,135
one dose of ibogaine can cure
physical addiction.

00:17:59,201 --> 00:18:01,103
Does it come with a free set
of steak knives?

00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:02,705
It comes with a free trip.

00:18:02,771 --> 00:18:05,374
Curing physical addiction
is a side effect.

00:18:05,441 --> 00:18:07,776
Its intended use
is to facilitate

00:18:07,843 --> 00:18:10,546
visual, tactile,
and auditory experiences

00:18:10,613 --> 00:18:12,148
of alternate realities.

00:18:12,214 --> 00:18:14,617
So it's an hallucinogen.

00:18:14,683 --> 00:18:19,155
Mm-hmm. Used by the Bwiti tribe
of central Africa.

00:18:19,221 --> 00:18:22,758
It comes from the powdered bark
of a tree growing in Cameroon.

00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,961
No kidding.

00:18:26,028 --> 00:18:28,230
Many ethno-botanists believe
that the iboga

00:18:28,297 --> 00:18:29,832
is what the Bible
is talking about

00:18:29,899 --> 00:18:32,034
when it refers
to the Tree of Knowledge.

00:18:32,101 --> 00:18:33,803
<i>The Bwiti consume</i>
<i>the powdered bark</i>

00:18:33,869 --> 00:18:35,871
<i>as part of an initiation</i>
<i>ceremony.</i>

00:18:35,938 --> 00:18:37,206
<i>After the ritual,</i>

00:18:37,273 --> 00:18:42,044
a man is called Baanzi, one
who has seen the other world.

00:18:42,111 --> 00:18:43,312
No way it's legal.

00:18:43,379 --> 00:18:44,713
Not in the U.S.

00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,515
So, Ed Burnell
was a drug dealer.

00:18:46,582 --> 00:18:48,551
Well...
He's either
dealing in
the addiction

00:18:48,617 --> 00:18:51,420
or the cure, and a
dealer's a dealer.

00:18:51,487 --> 00:18:55,090
And this guy's dealing
out of a halfway house.

00:19:20,282 --> 00:19:21,350
SARA:
Well...

00:19:21,417 --> 00:19:23,385
I can see why Doodles drank.

00:19:23,452 --> 00:19:26,689
So, if he's hooking
up in Tranny-town,

00:19:26,755 --> 00:19:29,592
you'd expect to find some
man-on-man porn.

00:19:29,658 --> 00:19:31,560
All we've got is varying flavors
of <i>Juggs.</i>

00:19:31,627 --> 00:19:33,295
Hmm.

00:19:44,373 --> 00:19:47,109
Looks like Doodles was working
out some animosity.

00:19:48,878 --> 00:19:50,880
Oh, an answering machine
with messages.

00:19:50,946 --> 00:19:52,314
( <i>beeps</i> )

00:19:52,381 --> 00:19:54,717
Friday, 11:02.

00:19:54,783 --> 00:19:56,152
WOMAN:
Hey, Doodle-pie.

00:19:56,218 --> 00:19:58,420
I can't stop thinking about
your enormous feet. Call me.

00:19:58,487 --> 00:19:59,922
( <i>beeps</i> )

00:19:59,989 --> 00:20:01,924
You know what they say
about big feet.

00:20:01,991 --> 00:20:03,159
Saturday, 7:00 p.m.

00:20:03,225 --> 00:20:04,393
MAN:
Okay, paddle boy,

00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,095
you want a war, you got one.

00:20:06,162 --> 00:20:08,964
And just so you know,
I do appreciate the irony

00:20:09,031 --> 00:20:10,699
of me leaving you a message.

00:20:10,766 --> 00:20:11,700
( <i>beeps</i> )

00:20:11,767 --> 00:20:13,502
Sunday, 11:45 a.m.

00:20:13,569 --> 00:20:15,771
MAN:
Hey, Mr. Doodles,
your taxi's here.

00:20:15,838 --> 00:20:17,540
MAN:
Yeah, yeah, cool your jets.

00:20:17,606 --> 00:20:18,974
I'll be right down.
( <i>beeps</i> )

00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:22,745
He took a cab ride
two days ago...

00:20:22,812 --> 00:20:25,014
and his costume's not here.

00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,082
Makes sense if he's out of town
on a job.

00:20:27,149 --> 00:20:29,285
I'll call
Detective
Cavaliere

00:20:29,351 --> 00:20:31,253
and have him pull
the phone records.

00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,756
MAN:
Ed Burnell worked here
for about a year.

00:20:33,823 --> 00:20:35,057
We're a halfway house.

00:20:35,124 --> 00:20:36,926
We provide a safe
place to live.

00:20:36,992 --> 00:20:39,228
I mean, if they're
going to do ibogaine,

00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:42,598
I'd rather have them do it in
here than out in the street.

00:20:42,665 --> 00:20:45,534
And despite the fact that
San Quentin is your alma mater

00:20:45,601 --> 00:20:47,603
and you have a record
as long as my leg,

00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:49,705
you wouldn't do anything
illegal, right?

00:20:49,772 --> 00:20:52,441
I wouldn't do anything
to jeopardize this place,

00:20:52,508 --> 00:20:54,510
and we don't give out
illegal drugs.

00:20:54,577 --> 00:20:56,445
We do a lot
of good work here.

00:20:56,512 --> 00:20:59,615
You know, if ibogaine
is such a miracle cure,

00:20:59,682 --> 00:21:02,017
wouldn't it make your life
easier?

00:21:02,084 --> 00:21:04,120
The drug doesn't promise
anything.

00:21:04,186 --> 00:21:05,354
You got to earn it.

00:21:05,421 --> 00:21:08,958
If a user doesn't realize
why he used in the first place,

00:21:09,024 --> 00:21:12,361
I mean, no power in the world
is going to make him stop.

00:21:12,428 --> 00:21:16,031
Right here is a good
case in point.

00:21:20,136 --> 00:21:22,238
So, you're going?

00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:24,907
Yeah.

00:21:24,974 --> 00:21:28,244
You sure that's what
you want to do?

00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:30,246
Yeah.

00:21:30,312 --> 00:21:33,182
This place just reminds
me too much of Ed.

00:21:35,551 --> 00:21:39,421
Look, I really wish
you'd stay here a little longer.

00:21:39,488 --> 00:21:42,424
I can't.

00:21:43,459 --> 00:21:46,762
You did a good
job here, Mindy.

00:21:46,829 --> 00:21:49,331
I'm still doing it.

00:21:52,001 --> 00:21:53,836
What's her story?

00:21:53,903 --> 00:21:56,205
Ed got her clean.

00:21:56,272 --> 00:21:57,706
Let me show you
what she looked like

00:21:57,773 --> 00:21:59,542
two months ago.

00:22:00,576 --> 00:22:02,211
BURNELL ( <i>on video</i> ):
Why are you here, Mindy?

00:22:02,278 --> 00:22:04,547
Wanna get off.

00:22:04,613 --> 00:22:09,218
I... I don't got
another run in me,

00:22:09,285 --> 00:22:13,022
but I can't stop.

00:22:13,088 --> 00:22:15,724
My name is Ed Burnell.

00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:19,962
I'm here to help you,
Mindy.

00:22:22,631 --> 00:22:25,100
This place is nice.

00:22:25,167 --> 00:22:27,670
Can I stay here?

00:22:27,736 --> 00:22:29,738
Yes.

00:22:29,805 --> 00:22:32,575
'Cause you're gonna
take care of me, right?

00:22:32,641 --> 00:22:34,944
Yes, I'm going
to take care of you.

00:22:39,148 --> 00:22:41,550
So, was it the ibogaine

00:22:41,617 --> 00:22:44,587
or the months
she spent here?

00:22:44,653 --> 00:22:46,455
You don't believe
in ibogaine?

00:22:46,522 --> 00:22:48,524
I don't believe in miracles.

00:22:48,591 --> 00:22:50,926
But Ed did?

00:22:50,993 --> 00:22:53,596
Look, when Ed first came here,
he was an asset to the place.

00:22:53,662 --> 00:22:57,133
And then he got...
religious about it.

00:22:57,199 --> 00:22:59,435
You know,
there's a reason why Mohammed

00:22:59,502 --> 00:23:01,370
kept his ass on the mountain.

00:23:01,437 --> 00:23:03,539
It was safe there.

00:23:03,606 --> 00:23:04,974
The thing about recovery

00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,309
is it only works
for those who want it,

00:23:07,376 --> 00:23:08,911
not for those who need it.

00:23:08,978 --> 00:23:10,579
But Ed came down
from the mountain,

00:23:10,646 --> 00:23:12,381
and he brought the ibogaine
with him.

00:23:12,448 --> 00:23:14,917
Yeah, and he started pushing it
on everyone.

00:23:14,984 --> 00:23:16,986
Sometimes he won,
sometimes he lost.

00:23:17,052 --> 00:23:20,523
From one addiction to another.

00:23:24,332 --> 00:23:26,417
WOMAN:
I can't believe Doodles is dead.

00:23:26,484 --> 00:23:27,585
How did it happen?

00:23:27,651 --> 00:23:30,154
We're hoping you can
help us find out.

00:23:30,221 --> 00:23:31,989
Yeah, according
to Sunburst Taxi,

00:23:32,056 --> 00:23:35,326
one of the drivers dropped off
the clown here two days ago.

00:23:35,392 --> 00:23:36,594
Yeah, that's right.

00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,095
My son was having
a birthday.

00:23:38,162 --> 00:23:39,530
It's my own little tradition.

00:23:39,597 --> 00:23:42,099
Birthdays, special occasions,
I always hire a clown.

00:23:42,166 --> 00:23:43,501
The kids love them.

00:23:43,567 --> 00:23:45,970
Except this time, I think
maybe we should've gone

00:23:46,036 --> 00:23:47,705
to Circus Circus.

00:23:47,771 --> 00:23:48,973
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,041
What do you mean by that?

00:23:51,108 --> 00:23:52,510
Well, we hired a clown--

00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:55,446
squirting flower,
big floppy shoes and all that--

00:23:55,513 --> 00:23:58,048
what we got was a smackdown.

00:23:58,115 --> 00:24:03,387
<i>Doodles was going through</i>
<i>his clown bit,</i>

00:24:03,454 --> 00:24:06,457
<i>and, uh, then this mime</i>
<i>comes through our kitchen,</i>

00:24:06,524 --> 00:24:08,893
<i>which at first we thought</i>
<i>it was part of the act.</i>

00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:15,132
What the hell
are you doing here?

00:24:15,199 --> 00:24:17,768
( <i>men grunting</i> )

00:24:27,812 --> 00:24:30,548
So, uh, I jumped in
and broke it up

00:24:30,614 --> 00:24:32,683
and dragged the mime
into the kitchen.

00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,418
I was going
to call you guys...

00:24:34,485 --> 00:24:36,153
Mm.
...but he apologized

00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:38,322
and said that, uh,

00:24:38,389 --> 00:24:41,091
there was bad blood
between him and Doodles.

00:24:41,158 --> 00:24:43,828
And he gave me a hundred bucks
for the damages,

00:24:43,894 --> 00:24:46,764
which I thought was
a pretty stand up thing to do,

00:24:46,831 --> 00:24:48,332
so I let him go.

00:24:48,399 --> 00:24:50,067
Did you get his name?

00:24:50,134 --> 00:24:52,937
I did better than that.

00:24:53,003 --> 00:24:55,206
He, uh, told me
he'd give me a great rate

00:24:55,272 --> 00:24:57,541
if I ever wanted to upgrade
from clowns.

00:25:00,845 --> 00:25:03,714
And what time did
Doodles leave?

00:25:03,781 --> 00:25:06,851
The kids were really upset
after the fight,

00:25:06,917 --> 00:25:09,286
so I took them out
for ice cream.

00:25:09,353 --> 00:25:11,555
Doodles stuck around
to help me clean up,

00:25:11,622 --> 00:25:13,757
and then he asked me
to call him a cab.

00:25:13,824 --> 00:25:16,193
Do you remember the name
of the taxi company

00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,561
or the time of the call?

00:25:17,628 --> 00:25:19,296
Well,
he'd been such a good sport

00:25:19,363 --> 00:25:21,398
that I offered
to give him a ride home.

00:25:21,465 --> 00:25:23,934
I dropped him off at his place
at around 8:30.

00:25:49,393 --> 00:25:51,328
Hey, excuse me.

00:25:53,164 --> 00:25:55,766
Take a look.

00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:05,943
Look, you do have the right
to remain silent,

00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:08,045
but unless you want
a trip to the station,

00:26:08,112 --> 00:26:09,580
I really wouldn't keep it up.

00:26:09,647 --> 00:26:12,116
You want to talk about Doodles,
fine.

00:26:12,183 --> 00:26:14,952
Take a look at what that skeek
did to me.

00:26:15,019 --> 00:26:17,688
You got that at Maguires'?

00:26:17,755 --> 00:26:19,423
( <i>grunts</i> )

00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:22,393
Stick a mime and a clown
in the same place,

00:26:22,459 --> 00:26:24,695
it's like a cobra
and a mongoose.

00:26:24,762 --> 00:26:26,897
You crashed Doodles' party,
he kicked your ass,

00:26:26,964 --> 00:26:28,199
and now Doodles is dead.

00:26:28,265 --> 00:26:30,134
I didn't kill him.

00:26:30,201 --> 00:26:32,937
You left a threatening message
on his answering machine.

00:26:33,003 --> 00:26:34,071
You declared war.

00:26:34,138 --> 00:26:35,372
Look, the creep was a parasite.

00:26:35,439 --> 00:26:37,942
When he wasn't bad-mouthing me,
he was horning in on my gigs.

00:26:38,008 --> 00:26:40,177
Every time I line up
a job, "ring-ring,"

00:26:40,244 --> 00:26:42,746
Doodles calls the mom,
gets her to hire him, too.

00:26:42,813 --> 00:26:44,381
That's money out of my pocket.

00:26:44,448 --> 00:26:47,051
So, yeah, I figured
a little payback was in order.

00:26:47,117 --> 00:26:49,353
Yeah, what did you do
after you left the Maguires?

00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:51,522
I had a strip mall opening
out of town.

00:26:51,589 --> 00:26:52,590
You didn't stop by his house?

00:26:52,656 --> 00:26:53,924
You know,
wait for him to come back?

00:26:53,991 --> 00:26:55,159
No.

00:26:55,226 --> 00:26:57,428
I got two hookers in
Pahrump who can verify.

00:27:00,931 --> 00:27:03,200
GRISSOM:
<i>We found prints</i>

00:27:03,267 --> 00:27:04,535
belonging
to three separate people

00:27:04,602 --> 00:27:05,703
in Ed Burnell's car:

00:27:05,769 --> 00:27:08,539
His, Jamal the thief,
and Mindy.

00:27:08,606 --> 00:27:10,040
He could have
given her a lift.

00:27:10,107 --> 00:27:11,876
Except we found her
print on a condom.

00:27:11,942 --> 00:27:13,544
Well,
she said she loved Ed.

00:27:13,611 --> 00:27:16,514
Yeah? How much, I wonder.

00:27:22,753 --> 00:27:24,655
BRASS:
We're looking
for information

00:27:24,722 --> 00:27:26,056
on Mindy Dupont.

00:27:26,123 --> 00:27:27,858
This was her last
known address.

00:27:27,925 --> 00:27:30,327
Yeah, she's here.

00:27:30,394 --> 00:27:32,596
Mind if we
talk with her?

00:27:32,663 --> 00:27:34,465
You got a search warrant?

00:27:34,532 --> 00:27:37,268
You don't need a warrant
just to talk.

00:27:37,334 --> 00:27:39,203
But if you want, we'll
go get one and come back.

00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:42,907
Hey, it's a free country.

00:27:42,973 --> 00:27:44,975
Yes, it is.

00:27:53,083 --> 00:27:56,787
BRASS:
Mindy Dupont.

00:27:57,822 --> 00:27:59,890
We thought you
cleaned yourself up.

00:27:59,957 --> 00:28:03,093
I tried so hard.

00:28:06,263 --> 00:28:10,701
He said I would feel again.

00:28:10,768 --> 00:28:13,470
I never wanted to feel.

00:28:17,341 --> 00:28:20,578
Ed saved my life.

00:28:20,644 --> 00:28:23,113
How do you repay
a favor like that?

00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:26,016
I tried.

00:28:27,818 --> 00:28:29,253
We're going to clean you up.

00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,489
What if I don't want
to be clean?

00:28:31,555 --> 00:28:32,756
No.

00:28:32,823 --> 00:28:35,926
I'm going to help you.

00:28:35,993 --> 00:28:39,263
He was an angel.

00:28:41,131 --> 00:28:44,502
He gave me that stuff.

00:28:44,568 --> 00:28:47,638
And you didn't want
to get high anymore.

00:28:47,705 --> 00:28:51,041
( <i>whimpers</i> )

00:28:57,014 --> 00:29:01,619
Did you come here to remember
or to forget?

00:29:05,055 --> 00:29:06,757
Well, the mime's alibi
checks out.

00:29:06,824 --> 00:29:08,692
He took Polaroids,
with the hookers.

00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:09,960
Strip mall opened at 7:30.

00:29:10,027 --> 00:29:12,196
He didn't leave Pahrump
till the next morning.

00:29:12,263 --> 00:29:13,697
Uh-huh.

00:29:13,764 --> 00:29:15,699
So that leaves
us with what?

00:29:15,766 --> 00:29:17,201
Nothing.

00:29:17,268 --> 00:29:18,836
Hmm.

00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:22,540
What about timeline?

00:29:22,606 --> 00:29:25,109
Mrs. Maguire gives
Doodles a lift,

00:29:25,176 --> 00:29:29,814
getting him home around 8:30.

00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,915
As far as we know,

00:29:30,981 --> 00:29:33,217
he didn't have
another job that night.

00:29:33,284 --> 00:29:34,785
Doodles goes home,

00:29:34,852 --> 00:29:36,821
having performing
all day for kids,

00:29:36,887 --> 00:29:38,122
wrestling with mimes.

00:29:38,189 --> 00:29:40,157
His costume would've
been a little skanky,

00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:42,726
yet he doesn't
change out of it?

00:29:42,793 --> 00:29:44,728
Maybe he never got inside.

00:29:44,795 --> 00:29:47,665
And he walks around
town in his clown suit

00:29:47,731 --> 00:29:48,899
until he gets killed?

00:29:48,966 --> 00:29:50,467
Okay, what are the knowns?

00:29:50,534 --> 00:29:52,469
Um...

00:29:52,536 --> 00:29:53,704
Doodles was suffocated.

00:29:53,771 --> 00:29:55,539
We found yellow fibers
up his nose.

00:29:55,606 --> 00:29:58,576
Greg analyzed the semen
stains on his boxer shorts

00:29:58,642 --> 00:30:02,046
and found an unknown vaginal
contribution in the sample.

00:30:02,112 --> 00:30:07,084
Mrs. Maguire was the last person
to see him alive.

00:30:09,253 --> 00:30:10,988
BRASS:
The night
Ed Burnell was killed

00:30:11,055 --> 00:30:13,057
you never checked
into the halfway house.

00:30:15,092 --> 00:30:18,796
Mindy, we found a knife
in your basket of clothes

00:30:18,863 --> 00:30:21,098
with Ed Burnell's
blood on it.

00:30:21,165 --> 00:30:24,401
Help us connect the dots.

00:30:26,437 --> 00:30:31,609
We all have this secret,
terrible cave in our hearts,

00:30:31,675 --> 00:30:35,613
and the more
we try to escape it,

00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:38,949
the deeper we drive ourselves
inside of it.

00:30:39,016 --> 00:30:41,218
This isn't
the halfway house, Mindy.

00:30:41,285 --> 00:30:45,589
You're looking at a murder
rap, so let's talk specifics.

00:30:45,656 --> 00:30:48,359
There were 57 micrograms
per milliliter

00:30:48,425 --> 00:30:51,462
of monoacetylmorphine
in your urine sample.

00:30:51,529 --> 00:30:55,799
That means you were
using for a while.

00:30:55,866 --> 00:30:57,902
Ed gave me ibogaine.

00:30:57,968 --> 00:30:59,403
That was months ago.

00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:01,305
Where were you the
night Ed was killed?

00:31:01,372 --> 00:31:05,776
It was like Adam and Eve
taking you to the movies

00:31:05,843 --> 00:31:10,080
except the movie was your life

00:31:10,147 --> 00:31:13,918
and you were watching it
and in it at the same time.

00:31:13,984 --> 00:31:17,321
Why would you have a knife
with his blood on it?

00:31:20,057 --> 00:31:22,293
I think Ed Burnell knew
you were using again

00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:24,829
and he was out there that
night looking for you.

00:31:24,895 --> 00:31:27,932
The spirits...

00:31:27,998 --> 00:31:30,801
they protect you.

00:31:30,868 --> 00:31:33,737
Well, you better hope so,
because you're under arrest

00:31:33,804 --> 00:31:35,840
for the murder of Ed Burnell.

00:31:40,915 --> 00:31:41,883
Sara. Excuse me.

00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:43,718
Could you, uh,
help me out?

00:31:43,785 --> 00:31:44,886
Yeah, with what?

00:31:44,953 --> 00:31:46,721
A woman.

00:31:46,788 --> 00:31:49,891
I need you to process
a female suspect for me.

00:31:49,958 --> 00:31:51,693
Sure.

00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,262
Palms down.

00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:02,570
Would you hold your
arms out, please?

00:32:39,274 --> 00:32:42,177
Thanks. You can get dressed now.

00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:45,380
Samples from your suspect.

00:32:45,447 --> 00:32:47,882
There's nothing but
a few track marks.

00:32:47,949 --> 00:32:50,218
No defensive
wounds, no bruising.

00:32:50,285 --> 00:32:53,054
Junkies usually
bruise if you breathe
on them too hard.

00:32:53,121 --> 00:32:56,991
She is a pile of
twigs, very frail.

00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:59,327
What?

00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:01,830
I haven't seen you
for a while, have I?

00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:04,899
You see me every day.

00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:18,012
It's all yours.

00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:19,681
SIDLE:
Thanks.
Yeah.

00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:22,684
So, we're looking
for clown sex...

00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:24,519
And clown murder.

00:33:53,815 --> 00:33:56,384
This fabric is consistent
with the fibers we found

00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:58,386
in Doodles' nose.

00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:02,824
You notice
how everything matches

00:34:02,891 --> 00:34:03,892
except this one pillow sham?

00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:08,530
Yeah.

00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:15,003
The white-faced clown
with a pillow covering his face.

00:34:15,069 --> 00:34:16,438
There must've been
some transfer.

00:34:16,504 --> 00:34:18,339
If a pillowcase like that

00:34:18,406 --> 00:34:21,009
had grease paint on it,
would you throw it out?

00:34:21,076 --> 00:34:23,044
I'd clean it first.

00:34:23,111 --> 00:34:26,114
♪ ♪

00:34:57,112 --> 00:34:59,981
♪ ♪

00:35:25,507 --> 00:35:27,509
You lied about driving
the clown home.

00:35:27,575 --> 00:35:30,912
He was in your bedroom.

00:35:30,979 --> 00:35:33,314
DNA on his boxer shorts

00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:35,517
indicates that you
had sex with him.

00:35:35,583 --> 00:35:40,021
We checked with the
Buddy Ween Agency,

00:35:40,088 --> 00:35:44,926
and, uh, you hire clowns
on a fairly regular basis:

00:35:44,993 --> 00:35:48,196
four, five, six
times a year.

00:35:48,263 --> 00:35:50,632
That's a lot of clowns.

00:35:51,666 --> 00:35:53,201
I already told you.

00:35:53,268 --> 00:35:55,170
I like clowns.

00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:58,173
I think you like them
more than most people.

00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,746
( <i>laughing</i> )

00:36:06,881 --> 00:36:08,483
Mr. Maguire, I hate
to tell you this,

00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:11,186
but while you were off
driving the other kiddies home,

00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:12,854
your wife was doing
the clown.

00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:16,224
We figured you must've
walked in on them...
in flagrante.

00:36:20,962 --> 00:36:24,332
( <i>grunting</i> )

00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:34,709
You stripped the body
and dumped it in an area

00:36:34,776 --> 00:36:36,511
frequented by
transvestites,

00:36:36,578 --> 00:36:39,347
hoping that it would
just... go away.

00:36:39,414 --> 00:36:41,750
Another forgotten
sex crime.

00:36:41,816 --> 00:36:44,052
You covered
your tracks.

00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:46,688
You cleaned the house.

00:36:46,755 --> 00:36:49,724
You washed that pillowcase.

00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:53,194
What I don't
understand, though...

00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:59,534
Why did you keep
the clown suit?

00:37:04,506 --> 00:37:06,808
You don't understand.

00:37:06,875 --> 00:37:09,144
Merrill and I have been
married nine years.

00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:10,545
We have two kids.

00:37:10,612 --> 00:37:12,781
Not much left
to get excited about?

00:37:14,883 --> 00:37:18,086
I love my wife.

00:37:18,153 --> 00:37:21,322
When Al wore the suit...

00:37:21,389 --> 00:37:23,658
it worked...

00:37:23,725 --> 00:37:26,461
and it was good.

00:37:26,528 --> 00:37:28,596
If you found

00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:31,332
something that got you off...

00:37:31,399 --> 00:37:33,935
wouldn't you keep it?

00:37:37,472 --> 00:37:39,174
Man, there is something
so heartbreaking

00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,476
about a woman
with raggedy drawers.

00:37:41,543 --> 00:37:43,278
Mm-hmm.

00:37:46,581 --> 00:37:48,483
Grissom, we've gone
through all

00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:49,884
of Mindy's stuff twice.

00:37:49,951 --> 00:37:50,985
There's no trace
of blood.

00:37:51,052 --> 00:37:53,021
STOKES:
Doesn't make any sense.

00:37:53,088 --> 00:37:54,456
If she disposes
of her clothes,

00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:56,791
she's not just going to
forget about the knife.

00:37:56,858 --> 00:38:00,462
Hey, guys, got a male
DNA skin sample collected

00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:02,964
from Mindy's hair.
Burnell?

00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:04,466
Yes and no.
The blood is Burnell's,

00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:06,267
but the skin belongs
to another guy.

00:38:06,334 --> 00:38:08,436
Do we know who?

00:38:08,503 --> 00:38:10,071
SANDERS:
The gods of CODIS
have blessed us

00:38:10,138 --> 00:38:11,439
with a hit:

00:38:11,506 --> 00:38:13,975
Riley "Boom-Boom" Renaldo,
proud owner

00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:16,344
of two assault and battery
charges and a possession

00:38:16,411 --> 00:38:18,012
with intent
to distribute.

00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:20,648
Current occupation:
apartment manager.

00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:22,150
What do you bet
Boom Boom's estate

00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:24,185
is on the corner
of Washington and D Street?

00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,622
Renaldo was Mindy's landlord?

00:38:27,689 --> 00:38:29,491
That'd make her
a bag-bride...

00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:31,159
a strawberry.

00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:33,194
Paid her rent
horizontally.

00:38:33,261 --> 00:38:35,296
As long as a dealer keeps
a strawberry high,

00:38:35,363 --> 00:38:37,198
the strawberry
does whatever
the dealer wants.

00:38:46,207 --> 00:38:48,910
BRASS:
Las Vegas Police. Open up.

00:38:53,615 --> 00:38:55,350
GIRL:
Riley...

00:38:55,417 --> 00:38:57,419
you said I could have a taste
when we were done.

00:38:57,485 --> 00:38:58,486
Riley!

00:38:58,553 --> 00:39:00,922
Shut up, Sunshine.

00:39:00,989 --> 00:39:04,492
Nice. We keep Mindy
for a couple of hours,
and you've already

00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:06,528
moved on.
What's the matter?

00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:07,629
Lose faith in Mindy?

00:39:07,695 --> 00:39:09,464
She always comes
back to you.

00:39:09,531 --> 00:39:11,299
Guess Burnell

00:39:11,366 --> 00:39:12,834
was bad for
business, huh?

00:39:20,642 --> 00:39:23,144
Yeah, Old Ed gets enough people
in the 'hood clean,

00:39:23,211 --> 00:39:24,679
you get no love.

00:39:24,746 --> 00:39:26,314
GIRL:
Riley...

00:39:26,381 --> 00:39:27,715
I need it.

00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:31,553
I said shut up.

00:39:33,721 --> 00:39:37,759
Mindy didn't need
it anymore, right?

00:39:37,826 --> 00:39:39,928
That's why you
helped her remember.

00:39:43,231 --> 00:39:45,433
I don't need that anymore.

00:39:47,735 --> 00:39:50,105
What do you mean,
you don't need it?

00:39:50,171 --> 00:39:52,740
Just one more, and that's it.

00:39:54,442 --> 00:39:56,578
Burnell wasn't hard
to find, was he?

00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:00,582
Yo, man... that jackass
who be messin'

00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:01,649
with Mindy is back...

00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:15,063
You've got nothing on me.

00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:18,800
Yeah, we do: Burnell's
blood on your skin.

00:40:18,867 --> 00:40:20,535
BRASS:
So, come on, let's go,
let's go.

00:40:20,602 --> 00:40:22,537
Come on, you have the
right to remain silent.

00:40:22,604 --> 00:40:24,539
Anything you say...
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:30,745
It's her choice, right?

00:40:30,812 --> 00:40:33,648
Unfortunately.

00:40:36,151 --> 00:40:38,486
What do you want to do,
take her to lock up?

00:40:38,553 --> 00:40:41,423
Lateral move.
She's already there.

00:40:59,474 --> 00:41:03,711
One guy's dead.
One guy's going to jail.

00:41:06,081 --> 00:41:07,348
Well, you're free to go.

00:41:09,918 --> 00:41:12,487
Go where?

00:41:38,279 --> 00:41:40,148
You got my message.

00:41:40,215 --> 00:41:43,051
Yeah. You sounded hungry.

00:41:43,118 --> 00:41:46,187
I was thinking... dinner
at the Bellagio.

00:41:47,222 --> 00:41:49,357
All right.

00:41:55,296 --> 00:41:58,032
What are you in
the mood for?

00:41:58,099 --> 00:42:00,468
Room service.
