00:00:07,915 --> 00:00:10,493
( <i>glass breaking</i> )

00:00:29,345 --> 00:00:31,881
Hey man, this place is a dump.

00:00:31,947 --> 00:00:33,883
I'm telling you,
this bitch is loaded

00:00:33,949 --> 00:00:35,318
and no one's seen her
for weeks.

00:00:37,386 --> 00:00:38,521
Come on, this place is trashed.

00:00:38,587 --> 00:00:40,690
You trying to make
me look stupid?

00:00:40,756 --> 00:00:42,792
No, man. I swear. Somebody
must have beat us to it.

00:00:42,858 --> 00:00:43,960
What the hell is this?

00:00:44,026 --> 00:00:45,661
( <i>short, abrupt siren sounding)</i>

00:00:45,728 --> 00:00:48,364
I'm out, man.

00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,002
MAN:
Gentlemen,

00:00:53,069 --> 00:00:56,539
put your hands
on your heads, please.

00:01:29,305 --> 00:01:31,240
Smudges.

00:01:31,307 --> 00:01:33,743
Nothing but smudges.

00:01:33,809 --> 00:01:36,212
Doesn't anybody use Formica
anymore?

00:01:37,246 --> 00:01:39,181
MAN:
First thing

00:01:39,248 --> 00:01:41,183
we did when we saw this
was call you guys.

00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,952
Didn't touch a thing.

00:01:44,353 --> 00:01:46,289
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:01:46,355 --> 00:01:48,858
So you going to open it?

00:01:48,924 --> 00:01:51,560
Eventually.

00:02:08,077 --> 00:02:09,945
( <i>quietly</i> ):
This is going to take all day.

00:02:11,247 --> 00:02:13,816
Sun Tzu once said,
"If you wait

00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:15,051
"by the river long enough,

00:02:15,117 --> 00:02:17,086
the bodies
of your enemies will float by."

00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:34,603
But those were brutal times.

Hey, hold up.

00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,308
Warrick?

00:03:25,374 --> 00:03:26,542
Hey, David.
Give me a minute

00:03:26,609 --> 00:03:28,110
and let me clear a path
here, okay?

00:03:28,177 --> 00:03:30,012
All right,
I'm not going anywhere.

00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:32,081
All right.

00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:39,455
There's at least four weeks
of mail here, Grissom.

00:03:39,522 --> 00:03:42,959
Four weeks of 100 degree days,
zero percent humidity.

00:03:43,025 --> 00:03:46,095
Eventually,
the body tissues sublimate.

00:03:46,095 --> 00:03:49,125
Cell fluids vaporize,
and all that's left --

00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:52,268
Proteins, fats and minerals.

00:03:52,268 --> 00:03:54,036
BROWN:
<i>Turns a grape</i>

00:03:54,103 --> 00:03:55,037
into a raisin.

00:03:55,104 --> 00:03:56,472
Well, the desert
was making mummies

00:03:56,539 --> 00:03:58,908
long before the Egyptians.

00:04:01,811 --> 00:04:03,813
Take a look at this.

00:04:08,184 --> 00:04:10,186
And look at
her fingers.

00:04:15,491 --> 00:04:17,693
She tried to claw her way out.

00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,962
Yeah.

00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:22,198
Which means
she was alive

00:04:22,265 --> 00:04:24,333
when she
was entombed.

00:04:26,002 --> 00:04:27,837
She was supposed to be,
like, this old widow, right?

00:04:27,904 --> 00:04:29,005
Like, always going out
to dinner

00:04:29,071 --> 00:04:30,306
and coming home
with shopping bags.

00:04:30,373 --> 00:04:31,941
Bitch had insurance money

00:04:32,008 --> 00:04:34,277
and word was that she kept it
in a box hidden under her bed.

00:04:34,343 --> 00:04:36,445
A retired grade-school teacher
living on a pension...

00:04:36,512 --> 00:04:38,147
Listen, man, we didn't kill her.

00:04:38,214 --> 00:04:39,382
No, I know that.

00:04:39,448 --> 00:04:42,084
What I want to know is,
other than the back door,

00:04:42,151 --> 00:04:44,520
did you or your partner touch
anything in the house?

00:04:44,587 --> 00:04:47,623
No. There was nothing left
<i>to</i> touch, man.

00:05:12,448 --> 00:05:14,050
Hey, Griss.

00:05:16,385 --> 00:05:17,854
Seem kind of odd to you?

00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,156
A woman who spends the time
making tea like this

00:05:20,223 --> 00:05:21,591
leaves a chunk

00:05:21,657 --> 00:05:23,092
of chocolate cake
on the counter.

00:05:24,093 --> 00:05:26,762
With a big bite out of it?
Yeah.

00:05:28,397 --> 00:05:30,967
Some crack head
brutalizes an old lady,

00:05:31,033 --> 00:05:34,370
leaves her in a closet,
and grabs

00:05:34,437 --> 00:05:35,538
a snack on the way out.

00:05:35,605 --> 00:05:36,906
Hopefully.

00:05:36,973 --> 00:05:39,375
Take it back to the lab.

00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:30,826
Shut up, get in there!

00:06:30,893 --> 00:06:32,895
Oh!

00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:37,233
( <i>labored gasping</i> )

00:06:43,673 --> 00:06:47,076
( <i>groans</i> )

00:06:50,179 --> 00:06:52,915
( <i>groaning</i> )

00:06:55,151 --> 00:06:58,454
( <i>groaning</i> )

00:06:59,989 --> 00:07:01,991
( <i>weak groan</i> ):
Oh.

00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:18,373
Fluoroscope showed no
bullet or stab wounds,

00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,908
and apart from
multiple fractures

00:07:19,974 --> 00:07:22,944
of her fingers and hands,
no other apparent injuries.

00:07:23,011 --> 00:07:24,646
So whoever boarded her up
in the closet

00:07:24,713 --> 00:07:26,081
maybe didn't intend
to kill her.

00:07:26,147 --> 00:07:27,415
Yeah.

00:07:27,482 --> 00:07:29,250
They must have thought
somebody'd find her--

00:07:29,317 --> 00:07:30,251
a friend or relative.

00:07:30,318 --> 00:07:31,486
She lived alone.

00:07:31,553 --> 00:07:33,121
Only relative was a nephew.

00:07:33,188 --> 00:07:34,422
Brass is looking for him.

00:07:34,489 --> 00:07:37,092
Live alone, die alone.

00:07:37,158 --> 00:07:40,662
In this case, from
massive dehydration.

00:07:40,729 --> 00:07:41,863
Rule of Threes:

00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:43,264
Three minutes
without air,

00:07:43,331 --> 00:07:44,632
three days
without water,

00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:46,668
and three weeks without food.

00:07:46,735 --> 00:07:49,738
Three days must have felt
like three years.

00:07:50,772 --> 00:07:52,974
Warrick said you found a
possible print at the scene.

00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:54,776
Need to rule hers out?

00:07:54,843 --> 00:07:57,245
Yeah. Also need
a dental impression.

00:07:57,312 --> 00:07:59,247
Well, that'll
be easy.

00:08:11,826 --> 00:08:13,862
WILLOWS:
<i>So, what do we have here?</i>

00:08:13,928 --> 00:08:15,730
Well, boy was out playing,
found the weapon,

00:08:15,797 --> 00:08:17,232
fired one shot,
dropped the weapon.

00:08:17,298 --> 00:08:18,400
No one's touched it since.

00:08:18,466 --> 00:08:19,634
Hmm.

00:08:19,701 --> 00:08:21,636
Okay, thanks.

00:08:21,703 --> 00:08:23,705
Yeah.

00:08:51,232 --> 00:08:53,268
Hey, Nathan.

00:08:53,335 --> 00:08:55,303
How's your foot?

00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:56,938
I got a rocket ship Band-Aid.

00:08:57,005 --> 00:08:58,106
Hmm.

00:08:58,173 --> 00:09:00,241
Yeah, I see that.

00:09:00,308 --> 00:09:02,043
Mrs. Timmel, does
the gun belong

00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:03,445
to someone in the house?

00:09:03,511 --> 00:09:04,679
No, absolutely not.

00:09:04,746 --> 00:09:06,348
My husband and I don't believe
in guns.

00:09:06,414 --> 00:09:08,216
We moved here from the city

00:09:08,283 --> 00:09:09,951
because it was supposed
to be safer.

00:09:10,018 --> 00:09:12,620
Nathan, where did
you find the gun?

00:09:12,687 --> 00:09:15,023
Seymour found it.

00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,224
Seymour?

00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:18,460
( <i>whispering</i> ):
His imaginary friend.

00:09:19,461 --> 00:09:21,062
So, you were playing
with Seymour,

00:09:21,129 --> 00:09:22,364
and he found the gun

00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:23,365
where?

00:09:23,431 --> 00:09:24,733
Over there.

00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:26,101
Well, where exactly?

00:09:26,167 --> 00:09:27,969
In the backyard.

00:09:28,036 --> 00:09:29,104
Was it buried?

00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:30,305
Did you dig it up?

00:09:30,372 --> 00:09:32,340
Nope.

00:09:34,376 --> 00:09:36,077
( <i>gunshot</i> )

00:09:36,144 --> 00:09:38,480
Will you ever play
with guns again?

00:09:38,546 --> 00:09:41,416
Nope.

00:09:43,218 --> 00:09:45,153
We don't need an I.D..

00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:48,223
Oh, the nephew said
he wanted to see her.

00:09:48,289 --> 00:09:49,691
Insisted on it.

00:09:49,758 --> 00:09:50,959
Made me curious.

00:09:51,026 --> 00:09:53,328
You Connor Foster?

00:09:53,395 --> 00:09:54,729
Yeah.

00:09:54,796 --> 00:09:56,798
I'm sorry I'm late.
I got lost.

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,436
This is the morgue, huh?

00:10:01,503 --> 00:10:03,905
You have to prepare
yourself for this.

00:10:03,972 --> 00:10:05,206
Your aunt was found

00:10:05,273 --> 00:10:07,776
in an advanced state
of decomposition.

00:10:11,813 --> 00:10:14,182
Oh, this is messed up.

00:10:14,249 --> 00:10:16,451
This is really

00:10:16,518 --> 00:10:17,952
messed up.

00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,321
Whoa! She just moved.

00:10:20,388 --> 00:10:21,523
Did you see that?

00:10:21,589 --> 00:10:23,491
I'm telling you,

00:10:23,558 --> 00:10:24,859
she just moved.

00:10:24,926 --> 00:10:27,662
Sometimes, when you see the body
of someone you know,

00:10:27,729 --> 00:10:29,664
someone you've seen move before,

00:10:29,731 --> 00:10:31,032
you want them to move.

00:10:31,099 --> 00:10:32,233
That's not her.

00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,435
This lady's too thin.

00:10:33,501 --> 00:10:35,370
That's not her
skin, either.

00:10:35,437 --> 00:10:36,705
My aunt always wore sunblock.

00:10:36,771 --> 00:10:38,506
Dry mouth.

00:10:38,573 --> 00:10:40,141
Diaphoresis.

00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:41,943
Red eyes,
dilated pupils.

00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:43,211
Huh?

00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:45,046
It means you're high.

00:10:46,081 --> 00:10:48,016
I got to go.

00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:50,185
We'd like you to stay.

00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:54,760
BRASS:
Where are you living
these days, Connor?

00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:57,177
At the YMCA
off Industrial,

00:10:57,243 --> 00:10:58,712
near the underpass.

00:10:58,778 --> 00:10:59,746
Nice.

00:10:59,813 --> 00:11:01,948
How's work?

00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,249
I don't have a job.

00:11:03,316 --> 00:11:04,918
I used to.

00:11:04,985 --> 00:11:06,286
Yeah.
Yeah, two years ago,

00:11:06,353 --> 00:11:08,621
your aunt reported
a pearl necklace stolen.

00:11:08,688 --> 00:11:10,890
You were busted trying
to hock it at a pawn shop.

00:11:10,957 --> 00:11:13,093
She dropped those charges.

00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:14,561
Oh, sure.

00:11:14,627 --> 00:11:15,929
Anything
for her favorite nephew.

00:11:15,996 --> 00:11:17,330
And what have you done
for her?

00:11:17,397 --> 00:11:19,599
She was lying in a coat closet
for over a month.

00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:20,767
You didn't call.

00:11:20,834 --> 00:11:22,335
You didn't stop by.

00:11:22,402 --> 00:11:24,704
I don't call her much.

00:11:24,771 --> 00:11:27,340
We only have
dinner on holidays.

00:11:27,407 --> 00:11:31,544
Whenever she sees me,
it makes her kind of sad.

00:11:31,611 --> 00:11:33,113
Do you get the munchies?

00:11:33,179 --> 00:11:35,315
When?

00:11:35,382 --> 00:11:36,983
When you're high.

00:11:39,586 --> 00:11:42,022
Do you like cake?

00:11:42,088 --> 00:11:44,624
( <i>laughs</i> ):
No, I go for burgers.

00:11:44,691 --> 00:11:45,959
Sonic.

00:11:46,026 --> 00:11:50,063
How would you like to make
a dental impression for us?

00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:52,532
I'll do whatever
you guys want.

00:11:52,599 --> 00:11:53,633
Hey, Rich.

00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,301
Whatcha got for me?

00:11:55,368 --> 00:11:58,405
Found this somewhere
where it didn't belong.
( <i>paper crinkling</i> )

00:11:58,471 --> 00:12:00,240
Unregistered.
No prints.

00:12:00,306 --> 00:12:02,575
Huh. Sweet piece.
Mm-hmm.

00:12:02,642 --> 00:12:04,744
.32 Beretta Tomcat.

00:12:04,811 --> 00:12:06,146
Titanium frame,

00:12:06,212 --> 00:12:08,314
stainless steel barrel
and slide.

00:12:08,381 --> 00:12:09,549
Super lightweight.

00:12:09,616 --> 00:12:11,951
Yeah, light enough
for a five year old to use.

00:12:12,018 --> 00:12:13,420
Ouch.

00:12:13,486 --> 00:12:14,587
He's okay. Thank God.

00:12:14,654 --> 00:12:15,655
Good.

00:12:16,656 --> 00:12:17,891
.32 caliber.

00:12:17,957 --> 00:12:19,893
Not many of these
in circulation.

00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:21,094
Well, that's
a good thing.

00:12:21,161 --> 00:12:22,429
Potentially.

00:12:22,495 --> 00:12:23,997
( <i>ammo rattling</i> )
Okay.

00:12:25,165 --> 00:12:27,000
Here we go.
Okay.

00:12:29,369 --> 00:12:30,837
( <i>gun clicks</i> )

00:12:37,665 --> 00:12:39,400
Two shots!

00:12:39,466 --> 00:12:41,435
( <i>metallic clunking</i> )

00:13:01,038 --> 00:13:04,141
There's showing up for work
and there's doing your job.

00:13:04,207 --> 00:13:06,643
Warrick brought in a
.32 auto Coroner's
bullet last week.

00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:09,446
D.B. in Maslow Park.

00:13:09,513 --> 00:13:12,015
You just found
the murder weapon.

00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:14,017
WILLOWS:
Frank Maddox.

00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:16,219
47-year-old white male.

00:13:16,286 --> 00:13:18,255
He's a bounty hunter.

00:13:18,322 --> 00:13:22,326
Single .32 round in
the side of his head.

00:13:22,392 --> 00:13:24,027
Bruises on his
face and chest.

00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:26,663
Autopsy ruled those premortem.
At least a day old.

00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:30,467
It was a close shot,
noncontact, downward angle.

00:13:30,534 --> 00:13:32,202
No primer residue
on the hands.

00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:34,371
T.O.D. was
approximately 2:00 a.m.

00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:36,206
No one found the body
until 7:00 a.m.

00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:37,607
A lot of wind...

00:13:37,674 --> 00:13:38,975
Warrick, your notes are great.

00:13:39,042 --> 00:13:40,377
Let the case speak for itself.

00:13:42,713 --> 00:13:44,448
I got to go
see my mummy.

00:13:52,189 --> 00:13:53,490
You know, I could've sworn

00:13:53,557 --> 00:13:55,559
I heard Grissom
telling you to do this.

00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:57,127
Yeah?

00:13:57,194 --> 00:13:58,895
You know what
rolls downhill?

00:13:58,962 --> 00:14:01,565
Apparently
bloated fingertips.

00:14:01,631 --> 00:14:04,067
Come on, you got a lot
of new skills to master.

00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:05,769
Field work's
a little messier

00:14:05,836 --> 00:14:07,804
than your test tubes
and your GCMS.

00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:10,207
Yeah, and a lot
less accurate.

00:14:10,273 --> 00:14:13,010
One continuous motion,
nice and easy.

00:14:17,447 --> 00:14:20,217
That's not bad.

00:14:20,283 --> 00:14:21,284
Keep practicing.

00:14:21,351 --> 00:14:22,452
Nine more to go.

00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:26,256
SIDLE:
Hey.
Hey.

00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:27,924
I heard about your mummy
in the closet.

00:14:27,991 --> 00:14:29,092
Very cool.

00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,427
Yeah, and we get
a 406 in Henderson.

00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:31,595
Want to trade?

00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,864
Nothing spells
excitement like
a B and E.

00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:45,108
( <i>knocking on door</i> )

00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,276
MAN:
Who is it?

00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:48,111
OFFICER:
Las Vegas Police, sir.

00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:50,180
Hey.

00:14:50,247 --> 00:14:52,883
We received a phone call
from a neighbor

00:14:52,949 --> 00:14:53,950
about a break in.

00:14:54,017 --> 00:14:55,819
Yeah, yeah, I'm, uh,
sorry, officers.

00:14:55,886 --> 00:14:57,454
There's been a
misunderstanding.

00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:59,256
My daughter, she
had some friends

00:14:59,323 --> 00:15:00,724
over tonight without
my permission,

00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:02,059
and, um, they
started drinking.

00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:03,126
They got out of control.

00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:04,528
They broke some stuff.

00:15:04,594 --> 00:15:07,297
A couple of windows,
but, uh, you know,

00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:09,132
we got it under control,
we're cleaning it all up.

00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,300
So I apologize for the trouble.

00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:11,735
OFFICER:
No trouble at all, sir.

00:15:11,802 --> 00:15:13,070
You have
a good night now.

00:15:13,136 --> 00:15:14,438
Thanks.

00:15:15,472 --> 00:15:16,907
( <i>Stokes sighs</i> )

00:15:16,973 --> 00:15:19,576
"To protect and serve."

( <i>chuckling</i> )

00:15:20,811 --> 00:15:22,779
Are you boys ready
for softball on Sunday?

00:15:22,846 --> 00:15:24,247
Ready to kick
your ass, Stokes.

00:15:24,314 --> 00:15:25,582
See you back
at the lab.

00:15:25,649 --> 00:15:27,417
All right.
You're ready to kiss my what?

00:15:27,484 --> 00:15:28,985
You heard me.

00:15:29,052 --> 00:15:32,155

( <i>gasps</i> )

00:15:39,696 --> 00:15:41,598
I need to go to the hospital.

00:15:41,665 --> 00:15:43,867
Please.

00:15:45,902 --> 00:15:47,938
SIDLE:
Suzanna, if you were
sexually assaulted...

00:15:48,005 --> 00:15:49,106
It was a party.

00:15:49,172 --> 00:15:50,440
It just got out of control.

00:15:50,507 --> 00:15:55,779
All I need is an AIDS test
and a morning after pill.

00:15:55,846 --> 00:15:57,681
Date rape is
still rape.

00:15:57,748 --> 00:16:01,184
Thank you for clearing that up.

00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:03,887
Hey.

00:16:03,954 --> 00:16:05,355
Hi.

00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:10,927
SUZANNA:
Does she...?

00:16:10,994 --> 00:16:13,130
Does she have to be in here
for this?

00:16:13,196 --> 00:16:15,666
No.

00:16:15,732 --> 00:16:16,733
Bye.

00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,268
Thank you.

00:16:18,335 --> 00:16:20,237
Okay.

00:16:20,303 --> 00:16:23,173
Go ahead
and put this on, okay?

00:16:29,913 --> 00:16:31,648
We're going to need
full-body photographs.

00:16:31,715 --> 00:16:34,251
If she can't talk,
the kit's going to
have to do it for her.

00:16:34,317 --> 00:16:35,485
Okay.

00:16:52,602 --> 00:16:54,538
Your, uh, mummy prints.

00:16:58,942 --> 00:17:01,044
Warrick's getting sloppy.

00:17:01,111 --> 00:17:04,114
Yeah, someone should really
have a talk with that guy.

00:17:06,917 --> 00:17:08,552
What's that?

00:17:09,586 --> 00:17:12,356
Dessert.

of all the kids
who were here tonight.

Why?

SIDLE:
Mrs. Kirkwood,

00:17:23,467 --> 00:17:26,703
Mr. Kirkwood,
your daughter has been raped.

00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:27,904
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:17:27,971 --> 00:17:29,973
What did she tell you?

00:17:33,777 --> 00:17:35,779
We're going to need
to search the premises.

00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:37,347
You can't
It's my house.

00:17:37,414 --> 00:17:39,416
You don't have a choice.
We have a warrant.

00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:42,519
I'm going to have
to ask you folks

00:17:42,586 --> 00:17:44,321
to step outside.
Thank you.

00:17:48,325 --> 00:17:49,926
I'll take the girl's room.

00:17:49,993 --> 00:17:51,662
Yeah, I'll take
the master.

00:19:49,999 --> 00:19:51,000
So, how do we know

00:19:51,067 --> 00:19:52,435
we're dealing with
the same suspect?

00:19:52,501 --> 00:19:54,003
We don't.

00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,771
Table against
the closet door,

00:19:55,838 --> 00:19:57,440
chair shoved
under the knob.

00:19:57,506 --> 00:19:58,708
It is the same M.O.

00:19:58,774 --> 00:20:00,876
Any connections
between the victims?

00:20:00,943 --> 00:20:03,679
Well, both victims
were left alive, we think.

00:20:03,746 --> 00:20:05,514
I mean, the old lady's death

00:20:05,581 --> 00:20:07,016
was probably
unintentional,

00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:08,484
and the girl's
rape was...

00:20:08,551 --> 00:20:10,086
Crime of opportunity?

00:20:11,354 --> 00:20:12,788
If you're out
to rob somebody's house,

00:20:12,855 --> 00:20:14,357
why would you do it
when they're home?

00:20:14,667 --> 00:20:17,403
GRISSOM:
The difference between
burglary and home invasion--

00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:19,772
infliction of terror.

00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,840
Talk to the cops?

00:20:20,907 --> 00:20:21,841
Say a word,

00:20:21,908 --> 00:20:23,476
and I'll kill you.

00:20:23,543 --> 00:20:25,311
I'll kill you, okay?

00:20:25,378 --> 00:20:28,815
Bad guys leave,
fear just stays behind.

00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:33,453
WILLOWS:
Maslow Park.

00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:34,754
All fun and games

00:20:34,821 --> 00:20:36,689
till the sun goes down.

00:20:36,756 --> 00:20:40,193
So, the bounty hunter
is here at 2:00 a.m.

00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,295
Like shooting fish
in a barrel.

00:20:42,362 --> 00:20:45,031
Almost guaranteed
to run into one of his skips

00:20:45,098 --> 00:20:47,500
or some lowlife
who knows where they are.

00:20:47,567 --> 00:20:50,069
Well, apparently,
someone found him first.

00:20:57,577 --> 00:21:00,046
Hunter becomes the hunted.

00:21:01,614 --> 00:21:04,517
A dozen perfect dump sites
within a mile of here.

00:21:04,584 --> 00:21:07,153
So, how does the gun
end up across town

00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:09,622
in the hands
of a five-year-old boy?

00:21:09,689 --> 00:21:10,957
Drive and dump.

00:21:11,024 --> 00:21:13,493
Doesn't make any sense.

00:21:25,104 --> 00:21:27,440
You never make it easy, do you?

00:21:27,507 --> 00:21:29,876
The center whorls
look similar.

00:21:31,377 --> 00:21:33,179
BROWN:
Can you generate
a composite?

00:21:33,246 --> 00:21:35,982
FRANCO:
Well, it's all about gestalt.

00:21:36,049 --> 00:21:37,483
When the whole of the pattern

00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:39,419
is greater
than the sum of its parts.

00:22:35,441 --> 00:22:37,543
SIDLE:
Once I pulled details,
I shrank it back down

00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:38,811
to 100%.

00:22:38,878 --> 00:22:40,246
Here's the thing.

00:22:40,313 --> 00:22:43,316
Looks like the bite
came from behind.

00:22:43,383 --> 00:22:46,286
Well, it was probably easier
to subdue her in that position.

00:22:46,352 --> 00:22:48,821
( <i>terrified moaning</i>
<i>and screaming</i> )

00:22:52,725 --> 00:22:54,894
You okay?

00:22:54,961 --> 00:22:56,596
Yeah.

00:22:59,899 --> 00:23:00,967
The occlusal plane

00:23:01,034 --> 00:23:04,003
looks the same.

00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:06,773
And the lateral incisor
overlaps the canine...

00:23:08,341 --> 00:23:10,443
...in both cases.

00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:11,978
Same person.

00:23:12,045 --> 00:23:14,347
Definitely not
the old lady's nephew.

00:23:15,682 --> 00:23:16,849
Hey, hey.

00:23:16,916 --> 00:23:18,651
Two partials
equal one slimeball.

00:23:18,718 --> 00:23:20,386
Jacqui got a hit through AFIS.

00:23:20,453 --> 00:23:23,189
The guy with the closet fixation
is Steve Jansson.

00:23:23,256 --> 00:23:25,458
Let's see if he has
an oral fixation as well.

00:23:25,525 --> 00:23:27,660
BRASS:
Little Stevie Jansson.

00:23:27,727 --> 00:23:28,928
How was the Home

00:23:28,995 --> 00:23:31,698
of the Good
Shepherd, Steve?

00:23:31,764 --> 00:23:34,100
Mac and cheese
was aces.

00:23:34,167 --> 00:23:36,536
Juvie offenses
don't mean squat.

00:23:36,603 --> 00:23:37,704
My record--

00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:38,905
it's been expunged.

00:23:38,972 --> 00:23:40,006
Expunged, huh?

00:23:40,073 --> 00:23:42,642
So, what's this crap
you're pulling now?

00:23:42,709 --> 00:23:44,477
SIDLE:
Two crime scenes,

00:23:44,544 --> 00:23:46,713
two prints-- both yours.

00:23:46,779 --> 00:23:48,548
BRASS:
And looking at
your adult record,

00:23:48,615 --> 00:23:51,084
this makes strike two and three
with one pitch.

00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:52,885
That's a real time-saver for us.

00:23:52,952 --> 00:23:55,355
I don't know
what you're talking about.

00:23:55,421 --> 00:23:56,623
Madeline Foster.

00:23:56,689 --> 00:23:57,857
The Kirkwoods.

00:24:01,761 --> 00:24:04,964
I do work for them sometimes.

00:24:05,031 --> 00:24:06,366
Odd jobs.

00:24:06,432 --> 00:24:08,368
So, if we asked

00:24:08,434 --> 00:24:11,337
the Kirkwoods, they'd say
you were their handyman, huh?

00:24:11,404 --> 00:24:14,307
Go ahead.

00:24:14,374 --> 00:24:15,742
Ask them.

00:24:15,808 --> 00:24:17,377
You always help yourself

00:24:17,443 --> 00:24:19,712
to something sweet
while you work?

00:24:21,714 --> 00:24:23,416
Bite it.

00:24:23,483 --> 00:24:25,051
MADDOX:
I'm saying it now,
and I'm saying it loud.

00:24:25,118 --> 00:24:26,619
I will bring Terrango
to justice.

00:24:26,686 --> 00:24:28,888
INTERVIEWER:
What makes you think
you'll succeed

00:24:28,955 --> 00:24:30,990
where so many others
have failed?

00:24:31,057 --> 00:24:32,492
Failure's not
an option.

00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:33,693
It never has been.

00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,261
You feeling me, Terrango?

00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:38,231
You can keep on running,
but I will keep coming.

00:24:38,298 --> 00:24:39,399
I will never stop.

00:24:39,465 --> 00:24:41,134
Them's fightin' words.

00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,635
Did he get his man?

00:24:42,702 --> 00:24:43,736
Actually, no.

00:24:43,803 --> 00:24:45,438
Terrango killed
two more people

00:24:45,505 --> 00:24:48,574
before another "recovery agent"
picked him up in Texas.

00:24:48,641 --> 00:24:50,944
Well, that probably
hurt business.

00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:52,178
Oh, yeah, it did.

00:24:52,245 --> 00:24:54,580
After that case,
his recovery rate

00:24:54,647 --> 00:24:56,783
went down practically
to zero.

00:25:01,821 --> 00:25:03,323
What about suicide?

00:25:03,389 --> 00:25:04,591
No.

00:25:04,657 --> 00:25:07,327
It's a non-contact wound
at a downward angle.

00:25:07,393 --> 00:25:08,761
It's a textbook murder.

00:25:08,828 --> 00:25:09,929
Maybe too textbook.

00:25:09,996 --> 00:25:11,864
A bounty hunter
would know how to fake it.

00:25:11,931 --> 00:25:13,066
Let's check out

00:25:13,132 --> 00:25:14,133
his right sleeve.

00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,201
Very odd-- unbuttoned.

00:25:15,268 --> 00:25:16,202
It's pulled way down.

00:25:16,269 --> 00:25:17,537
It would explain

00:25:17,604 --> 00:25:19,772
why there weren't any prints
on the gun.

00:25:24,711 --> 00:25:27,146
Doesn't explain
how the gun left the scene.

00:25:27,213 --> 00:25:29,315
Maybe someone found it
and grabbed it up.

00:25:29,382 --> 00:25:31,451
Just to toss it in suburbia
a week later?

00:25:31,517 --> 00:25:33,386
We're always looking
for a weapon.

00:25:33,453 --> 00:25:36,389
You'd think it'd be easier
when the weapon finds us.

00:25:36,456 --> 00:25:38,891
What's in the scope?

00:25:38,958 --> 00:25:39,959
It's polypropylene film.

00:25:40,026 --> 00:25:41,494
It was found
in the trigger guard.

00:25:42,729 --> 00:25:45,265
It's ribbon, for
wrapping presents and...

00:26:24,704 --> 00:26:26,005
You got a theory?

00:26:26,072 --> 00:26:28,241
You got ten bucks?

00:26:29,242 --> 00:26:30,910
Yeah.

00:26:34,047 --> 00:26:36,015
Jansson's dental impression
is consistent

00:26:36,082 --> 00:26:38,117
with the bite mark
on the girl's shoulder.

00:26:38,184 --> 00:26:40,553
Consistent, but
not conclusive.

00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,555
I spoke to Mr. Kirkwood.

00:26:42,622 --> 00:26:45,692
He wouldn't confirm or deny
Jansson's handyman story.

00:26:45,758 --> 00:26:47,427
He said he
couldn't remember.

00:26:47,493 --> 00:26:48,928
And without that, uh...

00:26:48,995 --> 00:26:50,296
Hey, guys, we're screwed.

00:26:50,363 --> 00:26:53,499
The semen from the rape kit
doesn't belong to Steve Jansson.

00:26:53,566 --> 00:26:54,901
No hits off CODIS either.

00:26:54,968 --> 00:26:56,069
There was more
than one guy.

00:26:56,135 --> 00:26:57,203
She was gang-raped.

00:27:02,675 --> 00:27:04,277
This gets cheerier
by the minute.

00:27:04,344 --> 00:27:06,879
Jansson's never going
to roll over on his partner.

00:27:06,946 --> 00:27:08,414
They're going to do it again.

00:27:08,481 --> 00:27:09,582
Yeah.

00:27:09,649 --> 00:27:11,117
We've given them
no reason to stop.

00:27:13,253 --> 00:27:15,355
( <i>doorbell ringing</i> )

00:27:20,293 --> 00:27:21,728
Hi.

00:27:21,794 --> 00:27:23,596
My name's Gil Grissom.

00:27:23,663 --> 00:27:26,866
I'm with the Las Vegas
Crime Lab.

00:27:28,201 --> 00:27:30,003
Suzanna, I said
I'd get it.

00:27:31,804 --> 00:27:33,406
What do you want?

00:27:33,473 --> 00:27:37,610
I already told the police
I have nothing more to say.

00:27:37,677 --> 00:27:38,645
I think you do.

00:27:38,711 --> 00:27:41,047
And I need you
to speak for someone

00:27:41,114 --> 00:27:43,016
who can't speak for herself.

00:27:43,082 --> 00:27:45,485
Another victim.

00:27:45,551 --> 00:27:47,453
I don't care
about another victim.

00:27:50,123 --> 00:27:51,791
Suzanna, please.

00:27:53,459 --> 00:27:55,995
Look, we know that two men
broke into your house.

00:27:56,062 --> 00:27:58,865
We have one suspect in custody,
but we can't hold him

00:27:58,932 --> 00:28:00,099
unless you talk
to us.

00:28:00,166 --> 00:28:01,301
I can't help you.

00:28:01,367 --> 00:28:02,635
I'm shutting the door now.

00:28:02,702 --> 00:28:04,804
Mr. Kirkwood,
I've done all that I can.

00:28:06,506 --> 00:28:09,342
I need what you saw.

00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:15,748
Mr. Grissom,
do you have a wife, children?

00:28:17,317 --> 00:28:18,651
No.

00:28:18,718 --> 00:28:21,120
Then you can't possibly
understand how I feel.

00:28:21,187 --> 00:28:24,290
All I am to you
is a folder in a drawer.

00:28:24,357 --> 00:28:26,326
And if I had
a wife and children...

00:28:26,392 --> 00:28:27,927
Then you wouldn't be here.

00:28:29,395 --> 00:28:30,964
I can't help you.

00:28:35,834 --> 00:28:36,968
STOKES:
Man...

00:28:37,035 --> 00:28:38,336
Mrs. Kirkwood was a Hoover.

00:28:38,875 --> 00:28:40,277
She even bleached the sheets.

00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:41,578
You know
what I don't get?

00:28:41,645 --> 00:28:42,913
How do they get in?

00:28:42,979 --> 00:28:45,115
There's no sign of forced entry
at either scene.

00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:47,551
Ring the doorbell;
that usually seems to work.

00:28:50,887 --> 00:28:52,088
Hey, hey, hey.
What?

00:28:52,155 --> 00:28:54,724
What is that
you just threw over there?

00:28:54,791 --> 00:28:57,594
Leftovers, I guess.

00:28:57,661 --> 00:28:59,462
BROWN:
You know that piece
of half-eaten shark

00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:01,198
with cake that
Gris and I found

00:29:01,264 --> 00:29:03,600
at the old lady
Maddie's house?

00:29:03,667 --> 00:29:05,302
This is from
the same restaurant.

00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:07,470
Links the victims.

00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:14,744
BROWN:
Same night as the home invasion.

00:29:14,811 --> 00:29:16,513
Signed by Mrs. Kirkwood.

00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:20,684
Dinner for one.

00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:24,487
Single women, dining alone--
easy targets.

00:29:25,655 --> 00:29:27,958
<i>All you have to do is</i>
<i>follow them home.</i>

00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,629
Same restaurant...

00:29:32,696 --> 00:29:35,498
Same waiter?

00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:41,238
Uh...

00:29:41,304 --> 00:29:43,106
sure, they're regulars.

00:29:43,173 --> 00:29:45,108
I haven't seen, uh,
Maddie in a while,

00:29:45,175 --> 00:29:46,977
but Mrs. K. comes
in every Thursday

00:29:47,043 --> 00:29:48,812
while her daughter's
at soccer practice.

00:29:48,879 --> 00:29:50,547
Well, you know all
your customers this well?

00:29:50,614 --> 00:29:52,616
I try to chat up
the ones that
come in alone.

00:29:52,682 --> 00:29:53,817
I feel bad for 'em.

00:29:53,884 --> 00:29:55,952
BROWN:
So both women
came in alone?

00:29:56,019 --> 00:29:58,154
Every week.

00:29:58,221 --> 00:30:00,190
Where were you after
your shift on Thursday night?

00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:03,994
Oh, uh... I was best man
at my friend's wedding.

00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,996
The Luxor has
that new wedding chapel.

00:30:06,062 --> 00:30:08,698
You get it at a discount
if you use it on a weekday.

00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:10,800
I can give you a number
if you...

00:30:10,867 --> 00:30:12,002
Down, boy.

00:30:12,068 --> 00:30:13,670
Thanks.

00:30:13,737 --> 00:30:14,738
Sure.

00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:19,242
I kind of doubt that
a clean-cut guy like Ryan

00:30:19,309 --> 00:30:21,444
is hanging out with
snaggletooth Steve.

00:30:21,511 --> 00:30:24,481
No, but I'd bet
somebody here was.

00:30:40,416 --> 00:30:41,851
Hi.
Hi.

00:30:41,918 --> 00:30:43,820
You here every day?

00:30:43,887 --> 00:30:45,655
Seven days a week,
till the sun goes down.

00:30:45,722 --> 00:30:47,590
I got a wife, a kid,
and 2.3 dogs to support.

00:30:47,657 --> 00:30:50,360
Do you recognize this man?

00:30:50,426 --> 00:30:51,461
Oh, yeah.

00:30:51,527 --> 00:30:53,529
He was here
a few days ago.

00:30:53,596 --> 00:30:55,565
A little bigger
than my average customer.

00:30:55,632 --> 00:30:56,833
Did he buy any balloons?

00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:59,002
Four big reds.

00:31:04,474 --> 00:31:06,543
I'll take what he bought.

00:31:31,968 --> 00:31:33,603
So, we know Jansson's
partner knew

00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:35,238
the customers
at the restaurant.

00:31:35,305 --> 00:31:37,907
Education, employment history
and a driver's license

00:31:37,974 --> 00:31:39,475
are required
for all employees.

00:31:39,542 --> 00:31:42,412
I've made a timeline of Steve
Jansson's illustrious life span.

00:31:42,478 --> 00:31:44,747
Places he's lived,
the places he's been arrested--

00:31:44,814 --> 00:31:45,982
you know, the highlights.

00:31:46,049 --> 00:31:48,151
You find
any commonalities?

00:31:48,218 --> 00:31:49,619
Well, Eric Shultz.

00:31:49,686 --> 00:31:51,321
Lives in the same neighborhood.

00:31:51,387 --> 00:31:52,322
BROWN:
Jose Cortez.

00:31:52,388 --> 00:31:53,923
Worked at the Wilson
Street Grill

00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:56,159
from '93 to '94.

00:31:56,226 --> 00:31:59,262
But the busboy, Kelly James--

00:31:59,329 --> 00:32:01,097
not only went
to the same high school,

00:32:01,164 --> 00:32:03,366
but graduated
from the same juvie center.

00:32:03,433 --> 00:32:04,634
SIDLE:
It's always nice

00:32:04,701 --> 00:32:06,436
when they come out worse
than when they went in.

00:32:06,502 --> 00:32:09,172
What do you think?
That's our guy, right?

00:32:09,239 --> 00:32:10,940
GRISSOM:
It's a connection.

00:32:11,007 --> 00:32:12,942
It's not enough to compel DNA.

00:32:13,009 --> 00:32:14,110
So we have nothing?

00:32:14,177 --> 00:32:16,946
No, we have a name,
and we know where he works.

00:32:17,013 --> 00:32:19,415
STOKES:
I'll find out
where he was the night

00:32:19,482 --> 00:32:22,886
the Kirkwoods were invaded.
( <i>pager beeps</i> )

00:32:42,238 --> 00:32:44,007
Lineup's almost ready to go.

00:32:44,073 --> 00:32:46,242
Listen, when she
IDs Kelly James,

00:32:46,309 --> 00:32:48,311
we're going to need
a DNA sample

00:32:48,378 --> 00:32:50,780
and an immediate
hold, no bail.

00:32:50,847 --> 00:32:52,415
He's not a flight risk.

00:32:52,482 --> 00:32:53,683
He's a risk.

00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:55,785
SIDLE:
Hey, Suzanna.

00:32:58,388 --> 00:33:02,292
Um, why don't we go hang out
until they're ready for us?

00:33:02,358 --> 00:33:05,728
We'll get a glass
of water or something.

00:33:07,964 --> 00:33:12,502
I'm really glad
you decided to come today.

00:33:19,209 --> 00:33:22,712
Do you... you want to hear
something stupid?

00:33:24,047 --> 00:33:25,815
Sure.

00:33:31,054 --> 00:33:34,190
My boyfriend and I
had been talking about

00:33:34,257 --> 00:33:36,926
having sex
for a of couple months.

00:33:38,394 --> 00:33:40,496
I always said no

00:33:40,563 --> 00:33:44,701
because I was afraid that
my parents would find out.

00:33:54,911 --> 00:33:56,479
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:33:56,546 --> 00:33:58,281
Mr. Kirkwood, I'm sorry.

00:33:58,348 --> 00:34:01,718
The other day,
I thought you were saying

00:34:01,784 --> 00:34:04,187
that you "wouldn't" help me,

00:34:04,254 --> 00:34:06,456
and now I realize that
you couldn't.

00:34:08,992 --> 00:34:10,960
I never got a good look
at them.

00:34:14,097 --> 00:34:15,598
We're ready.

00:34:15,665 --> 00:34:17,133
Can she come with me?

00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,035
BRASS:
I already cleared it

00:34:19,102 --> 00:34:21,671
with the public defender.

00:34:24,974 --> 00:34:26,276
She's 16.

00:34:26,342 --> 00:34:28,912
I only had two jobs left--

00:34:28,978 --> 00:34:32,081
teach her to think
for herself,

00:34:32,148 --> 00:34:34,117
keep her safe.

00:34:36,686 --> 00:34:39,656
I got one right.

00:34:39,722 --> 00:34:42,091
BRASS:
Here's how this works:

00:34:42,158 --> 00:34:43,793
There are five guys
in a line.

00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:46,529
We're going to ask
each of them to step forward,

00:34:46,596 --> 00:34:49,198
turn to the side,
and then face forward again.

00:34:49,265 --> 00:34:52,335
Now, if you want a second look
or you need more time,

00:34:52,402 --> 00:34:53,836
just let us know.

00:34:53,903 --> 00:34:57,207
When you're ready
to make a decision,

00:34:57,273 --> 00:34:59,676
write it down
on this piece of paper.

00:34:59,742 --> 00:35:02,779
Remember, you can see them,
but they can't see you.

00:35:02,845 --> 00:35:05,248
Okay?

00:35:05,315 --> 00:35:08,017
He already knows it's me.

00:35:08,084 --> 00:35:09,185
SIDLE:
Suzanna,

00:35:09,252 --> 00:35:10,453
you can do this.

00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,355
I know you can.

00:35:18,962 --> 00:35:20,730
Okay.

00:35:22,265 --> 00:35:26,069
MAN ( <i>over intercom</i> ):
Number One, please step forward.

00:35:26,135 --> 00:35:29,138
Turn to the left.

00:35:29,205 --> 00:35:32,342
Step back.

00:35:32,408 --> 00:35:35,912
Number Two, step forward.
Turn to your left.

00:35:35,979 --> 00:35:37,447
MICHAEL:
<i>You know, people say</i>

00:35:37,513 --> 00:35:38,815
you never forget.

00:35:38,882 --> 00:35:43,386
Truth is... you do forget.

00:35:43,453 --> 00:35:45,788
And then you remember.

00:35:45,855 --> 00:35:48,191
It makes it worse.

00:35:48,258 --> 00:35:51,327
It was like, uh,

00:35:51,394 --> 00:35:55,598
it's like my brain...
doesn't know where to put it.

00:35:55,665 --> 00:35:58,067
( <i>screaming</i> )

00:35:58,134 --> 00:36:00,470
( <i>man yelling</i> )

00:36:00,536 --> 00:36:02,572
( <i>crying and pleading</i> )

00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:06,276
You know, it must've run
through a million times
in my mind...

00:36:06,342 --> 00:36:08,745
Somebody breaks in.
I get a baseball bat.

00:36:08,811 --> 00:36:11,414
Get everybody
out the back door.

00:36:11,481 --> 00:36:14,918
Call the cops.
My family's safe.

00:36:19,188 --> 00:36:21,891
And I just stood there...

00:36:26,896 --> 00:36:29,699
MAN ( <i>over intercom</i> ):
Number Four, step forward.

00:36:44,113 --> 00:36:45,448
Turn to your left.

00:36:52,288 --> 00:36:53,856
( <i>crying</i> ):
No!

00:36:53,923 --> 00:36:55,959
( <i>screaming</i> )

00:36:56,025 --> 00:36:57,794
Suzanna!
My baby!

00:37:01,998 --> 00:37:05,335
And when Suzanna was
a little girl,

00:37:05,401 --> 00:37:10,273
Linda made me put those, um,
the child-proof locks

00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:13,276
on all the kitchen cabinets.

00:37:13,343 --> 00:37:15,411
I complained.

00:37:15,478 --> 00:37:17,580
You know what
she said to me?

00:37:17,647 --> 00:37:19,816
She said, uh,

00:37:19,883 --> 00:37:25,688
"The least we can do is
make her safe in her own house."

00:37:29,592 --> 00:37:32,362
Mr. Kirkwood...

00:37:32,428 --> 00:37:34,797
you didn't do
anything wrong.

00:37:34,864 --> 00:37:37,300
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:37:39,702 --> 00:37:41,004
( <i>whispers</i> ):
Baby.

00:37:42,171 --> 00:37:46,042
( <i>sobbing quietly</i> )
Oh, it's okay,
it's okay. Shh.

00:37:51,681 --> 00:37:53,516
She froze up.
She couldn't do it.

00:37:53,583 --> 00:37:55,251
Her reaction
should be enough.

00:37:55,318 --> 00:37:56,686
What do you think?

00:37:56,753 --> 00:37:58,521
BRASS:
Well, we've got
enough to hold

00:37:58,588 --> 00:38:01,391
this Jansson kid,
but the other guy...

00:38:01,457 --> 00:38:03,826
Unless she writes
a number down,

00:38:03,893 --> 00:38:05,962
there's nothing we can do.

00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,402
Hey.

00:38:12,468 --> 00:38:14,237
I'm sorry to hear
about your case.

00:38:14,304 --> 00:38:15,338
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:38:15,405 --> 00:38:18,208
We were so close,
you don't even know.

00:38:18,274 --> 00:38:21,711
Well, he'll be back.
We'll get him eventually.

00:38:21,778 --> 00:38:22,946
Yeah.

00:38:23,012 --> 00:38:25,381
Want to go for a ride?

00:38:26,516 --> 00:38:29,686
Probably safer than anything
else I had planned. Yeah.

00:38:32,422 --> 00:38:36,459
Frank Maddox--
badass bounty hunter
on his way down.

00:38:36,526 --> 00:38:38,928
Loses his rep,
loses his edge...

00:38:38,995 --> 00:38:40,063
Loses his manhood.

00:38:40,129 --> 00:38:43,099
Guess he thought
he had nothing left to live for.

00:38:43,166 --> 00:38:44,467
Except maybe
one thing:

00:38:44,534 --> 00:38:46,202
going out with
his boots on.

00:38:46,269 --> 00:38:48,705
<i>He picks a known hot spot,</i>

00:38:48,771 --> 00:38:51,708
<i>and waits until it gets dark.</i>

00:38:51,774 --> 00:38:56,246
<i>Angles the gun down...</i>
( <i>gunshot</i> )

00:38:56,312 --> 00:39:00,550
<i>And the balloons make it</i>
<i>look like murder.</i>

00:39:00,617 --> 00:39:03,086
BROWN:
<i>On a windy night,</i>
<i>a balloon can go for miles.</i>

00:39:03,152 --> 00:39:05,188
Until...

00:39:15,298 --> 00:39:18,534
You leave the city
to get away from crime,

00:39:18,601 --> 00:39:20,870
and guns fall
out of the sky.

00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:25,942
( <i>classical music plays</i> )

00:39:35,718 --> 00:39:37,520
Get your kit.
