There's a baby

00:00:45,687 --> 00:00:48,089

It's not my car.

00:00:48,156 --> 00:00:49,524

00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:50,592
Somebody help us!
Get back!

00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:45,678
Chances are she's been dead
less than 24 hours.

00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:47,012
Neck looks broken,

00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:49,181
her head's split,

00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:51,784
but there's
no cone of foam.

00:04:51,851 --> 00:04:53,119
No what?

00:04:53,185 --> 00:04:55,287
Uh, we have air
in our lungs--

00:04:55,354 --> 00:04:57,089
add water, you get foam.

00:04:57,156 --> 00:04:58,524
It means she didn't drown.

00:04:58,591 --> 00:05:01,694
Well, apparently,
it's not the only way
to die out here.

I was supposed

00:05:21,247 --> 00:05:23,549
It was a hectic morning.

00:05:23,616 --> 00:05:26,252
My cell phone was going off.

00:05:26,318 --> 00:05:28,053
Problems at the office.

00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,022
Look, I don't care
how much pressure

00:05:30,089 --> 00:05:31,557
we get from the financier.

00:05:31,624 --> 00:05:33,058

can you hold on a second?

00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:34,293
I have anoth...

00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,028
I'm sorry,
I can't do this right now.

00:05:36,095 --> 00:05:37,830
I'm driving.
Look, hold all the calls,

00:05:37,897 --> 00:05:39,365
call my wife,
tell her I'll be...

00:05:39,432 --> 00:05:40,466
I'll be home late.

00:05:40,533 --> 00:05:42,802
I forgot he was
in the back seat.

00:05:42,868 --> 00:05:44,036
How could you forget?

00:05:44,103 --> 00:05:45,704
I'm not the one
who drives him.

00:05:45,771 --> 00:05:47,573
Vickie does that.

00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:51,343
I was distracted.

00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:53,546
My-my job consumes
so much of my mind...

00:05:53,612 --> 00:05:55,714
So, what kind of job you have
that's so distracting?

00:05:55,781 --> 00:05:59,718
I'm an agent for the
gaming commission.

00:05:59,785 --> 00:06:02,755
It's a 25-hour-a-day job,
eight days a week.

00:06:02,822 --> 00:06:03,989
Your wife work?

00:06:04,056 --> 00:06:06,692
She works as much as me.

00:06:10,529 --> 00:06:12,598
Joshua made it all worthwhile.

00:06:12,665 --> 00:06:14,600
BRASS:
Where's your wife now?

00:06:14,667 --> 00:06:17,336
She's in L.A.
on business.

00:06:20,506 --> 00:06:22,675
What am I going to tell her?

00:06:38,224 --> 00:06:41,060
We need <i>something.</i>

00:06:46,298 --> 00:06:47,900
No birthmark,

00:06:47,967 --> 00:06:50,569
no scars, no tattoos.

00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,215
It's a locker key.

00:07:04,283 --> 00:07:06,452
You put in
for the promotion, huh?

00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:08,053
Yeah. Yeah, last week.

00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,955
I still haven't heard
anything about it.

00:07:10,022 --> 00:07:11,257
Yeah, neither have I.

00:07:11,323 --> 00:07:12,391
MAN:
Hey,

00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:13,826
you ready
for me?

00:07:13,893 --> 00:07:15,494
She's all yours.

00:07:15,561 --> 00:07:18,597
Heard you had a rough morning.

00:07:18,664 --> 00:07:20,566
I've had better.

00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:41,620
Sara, take a look at this.

00:07:41,687 --> 00:07:44,123
What is that?

00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:46,592
I don't know.

00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:53,199
You were right about
your dead swimmer.

00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:54,767
She didn't drown.

00:07:54,834 --> 00:07:57,503
Cause of death was
a palpable fracture
of the neck

00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:59,472
at C1/C2.
SIDLE:
From the blow
to the head.

00:07:59,538 --> 00:08:00,606
Probably.

00:08:00,673 --> 00:08:02,675
Cerebral contusion's
beneath the skull fracture.

00:08:02,741 --> 00:08:03,976
Savage hit.

00:08:04,043 --> 00:08:05,945
Greg processed
the sexual assault kit.

00:08:06,011 --> 00:08:07,213
Positive for semen.

00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:09,315
There were no physical findings
for rape.

00:08:09,381 --> 00:08:10,649
Not a lot to go on here.

00:08:10,716 --> 00:08:13,853
Gastric lumen contained
dark, pasty material--

00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,455
maybe slightly digested meat,
stringy vegetable matter.

00:08:16,522 --> 00:08:17,857
Does it give us a timeline?

00:08:17,923 --> 00:08:20,359
Emptying rates vary
from person to person,

00:08:20,426 --> 00:08:23,195
but I'd estimate she ate
two to four hours before death.

00:08:23,262 --> 00:08:24,697
All right, good.

00:08:24,764 --> 00:08:27,767
Ranger Stone came through--
found our locker.

00:08:29,068 --> 00:08:31,637
Ms. Willows, uh,
Chief Deputy D.A.

00:08:31,704 --> 00:08:33,205
Jeffrey Sinclair.
Mm-hmm.

00:08:33,272 --> 00:08:35,508
Personal visit--
must be important.
It is.

00:08:35,574 --> 00:08:38,377
Joshua Winston,
the dead infant?
We're working on it.

00:08:38,444 --> 00:08:40,412
How long was the baby
left inside the car?

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,150
Based on the time of death,
we estimate roughly an hour.

00:08:44,216 --> 00:08:46,519
The 9-1-1 call came in
at 11:30 in the morning.

00:08:46,585 --> 00:08:51,223
Okay, and what time does
Paul Winston start work?

00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:53,726
According to Captain Brass,
uh, 10:00 a.m.

00:08:53,793 --> 00:08:55,828
( <i>scoffs</i> ):
Hour and a half.

00:08:55,895 --> 00:08:57,530
Come on, look,
I've got

00:08:57,596 --> 00:08:59,698
a three-year-old at home,
and I've left him inside

00:08:59,765 --> 00:09:01,967
a covered garage
with groceries for
two minutes, tops,

00:09:02,034 --> 00:09:03,536
but two hours, in this heat?

00:09:03,602 --> 00:09:04,937
I know. It's a tragedy.

00:09:05,004 --> 00:09:06,572
You know,
cases like these

00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:08,841
almost never see the
inside of a courtroom.

00:09:08,908 --> 00:09:10,176
This one will.

00:09:10,242 --> 00:09:12,878
Is there any worse punishment
than losing your child?

00:09:12,945 --> 00:09:14,947
Yeah. Jail time.

00:09:15,014 --> 00:09:17,016
I want him behind bars,
so the next time

00:09:17,082 --> 00:09:19,652
a parent steps away
from their vehicle
in triple-degree heat,

00:09:19,718 --> 00:09:21,921
they check the back seat
before they lock the door.

00:09:21,987 --> 00:09:24,256
Doesn't change my job.

00:09:24,323 --> 00:09:29,628
Look... I-I need you
guys to thoroughly
document this case.

00:09:29,695 --> 00:09:31,730
I don't want any more
surprises in court,

00:09:31,797 --> 00:09:36,569
so from the car to the kid,
just try to cross your T's
and dot your I's, okay?

00:09:36,635 --> 00:09:40,206
I always do.

00:09:41,273 --> 00:09:43,476
WILLOWS:
Car seat's fastened correctly.

00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:45,578
Most aren't.

00:09:53,452 --> 00:09:55,154
Hey, Gil.

00:09:55,221 --> 00:09:58,390
Look at this.
What do you see?

00:09:58,457 --> 00:09:59,759
Um...

00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:02,294
Nothing.

00:10:02,361 --> 00:10:03,496
Exactly.

00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:05,631
There's no indentations
in the leather.

00:10:05,698 --> 00:10:07,566
Well, maybe this wasn't
the primary vehicle

00:10:07,633 --> 00:10:08,934
for transporting the baby.

00:10:09,001 --> 00:10:09,935
Yeah.

00:10:10,002 --> 00:10:11,804
Same thing
the father said.

00:10:11,871 --> 00:10:13,205
What is that?

00:10:14,473 --> 00:10:16,008
Oh.

00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:33,192
Negative for blood.

00:10:33,259 --> 00:10:35,828

It's hot in here.

00:11:04,123 --> 00:11:05,257
Hell, yeah.

00:11:08,294 --> 00:11:10,096
Super came in
to the check the A.C.

00:11:10,162 --> 00:11:11,931
and he found him like this.

00:11:11,997 --> 00:11:14,633
Wesley Jones. 33.

00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,901
In his massage chair.

00:11:15,968 --> 00:11:19,371
No signs of forced entry.

00:11:19,438 --> 00:11:20,639
It doesn't appear

00:11:20,706 --> 00:11:22,775
that robbery was a motive.

00:11:25,945 --> 00:11:27,980
A small bruise
on his fingertip,

00:11:28,047 --> 00:11:31,550
but no outward signs of trauma.

00:11:31,617 --> 00:11:32,985
I had a case once
where a soda can

00:11:33,052 --> 00:11:34,487
was the murder weapon.

00:11:34,553 --> 00:11:36,122
Suspect used it

00:11:36,188 --> 00:11:38,124
to bash in the victim's head.

00:11:45,664 --> 00:11:47,433
Diet shake,
fitness magazine,

00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,602
cookie crumbs
on the baking sheet.

00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:53,072
This guy trying to start a diet
or falling off of one.

He's got a workout schedule.

00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:56,942
And today...

00:11:57,009 --> 00:11:58,477
a three-mile run.

00:11:58,544 --> 00:11:59,845
Whew.

00:12:02,181 --> 00:12:04,617
Fat metabolizers,

00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:06,652
containing ephedra.

00:12:06,719 --> 00:12:10,322
Scorching heat and ephedra--
that's not good.

00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:21,600
( <i>grunts</i> )

00:12:21,667 --> 00:12:23,836
( <i>panting</i> )

00:12:25,171 --> 00:12:26,972
Sounds like a heat stroke to me.

00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:29,575
Yeah. Feel the burn.

00:12:32,545 --> 00:12:34,213
Hey, Greg.
Hey.

00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,481
How we doing
on that swab?

00:12:35,548 --> 00:12:37,516
It should be ready any minute.

00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:38,884
Another baby.

00:12:38,951 --> 00:12:41,454
Hear the D.A.'s
really gunning
for the father.

00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,322
What do you think they're going
to charge him with? Murder?

00:12:43,389 --> 00:12:45,524
Not likely.
Child endangerment,

00:12:45,591 --> 00:12:48,294
child... neglect,
child abuse.

00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,463
Sounds like a slap
on the wrist to me.

00:12:50,529 --> 00:12:53,065
You and the D.A. can
shake hands.

00:12:53,132 --> 00:12:54,800
( <i>printer humming</i> )

00:12:54,867 --> 00:12:57,570
Your printout's ready.

00:13:00,139 --> 00:13:02,408
The red stain in the car...

00:13:02,475 --> 00:13:04,009
Brompheniramine maleates.

00:13:04,076 --> 00:13:05,878
USP-one.

00:13:05,945 --> 00:13:08,681
Cough syrup.

00:13:17,445 --> 00:13:19,147
( <i>coins rattle</i> )

00:13:19,214 --> 00:13:20,982
Dollar slots?

00:13:21,049 --> 00:13:23,651
Is there truly no place left
in Las Vegas

00:13:23,718 --> 00:13:25,720
without slot machines?

00:13:29,792 --> 00:13:32,895
University student I.D.
Sophia Renatta.

00:13:32,962 --> 00:13:34,430
20 years old.

00:13:34,497 --> 00:13:36,699
SIDLE:
A guy's wallet?

00:13:36,766 --> 00:13:40,369
No credit card.
No driver's license.

00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:43,205
Well, this is too big
for Sophia.

00:13:43,272 --> 00:13:44,774
It's a double extra large.

00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,709
Well, that's
definitely a guy's.

00:13:46,776 --> 00:13:48,744
Cold be a boyfriend
or beach buddy.

00:13:48,811 --> 00:13:50,045
Suspect?

00:13:50,112 --> 00:13:51,881
Yeah. I remember her...

00:13:51,947 --> 00:13:54,049
and her punk
in shinning armor.

00:13:54,116 --> 00:13:55,584
He wasn't a cool guy?

00:13:55,651 --> 00:13:57,620
The dude stiffed me,
twice, bro.

00:13:57,686 --> 00:14:00,456
Rents my Waverunner,
doesn't bring it back.

00:14:00,523 --> 00:14:01,924
And his cheap-ass plastic's

00:14:01,991 --> 00:14:03,092
got a 2-K limit.

00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:05,094
I'm out five grand.
SIDLE:
Ouch.

00:14:05,161 --> 00:14:06,796
Did they look like
a couple to you?

00:14:06,862 --> 00:14:08,864
She was a pretty girl
with a problem.

00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,533
He knew an "in"
when he saw one.

00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:11,734
You got a credit card?

00:14:11,801 --> 00:14:13,035
No, this is all I have.

00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,270
No, why don't you ask dad.
We got a line here.

00:14:14,336 --> 00:14:15,638
Why don't you step aside.

00:14:15,704 --> 00:14:17,339
Maybe, maybe
I can help.

00:14:21,644 --> 00:14:23,312
So you think
they just met?

00:14:23,379 --> 00:14:24,480
It's a hot day...

00:14:24,547 --> 00:14:25,815
something must've been
in the air.

00:14:25,881 --> 00:14:27,817
We'll need to look at your
rental log if you don't mind.

00:14:27,883 --> 00:14:29,552
Go crazy.
Thanks.

00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:31,420
Thanks.

00:14:33,522 --> 00:14:34,957
Here it is.
Mark Young.

00:14:35,024 --> 00:14:37,159
Checked out the
Waverunner 11:45.

00:14:37,226 --> 00:14:40,496
But he and Sophia
didn't hit the water
until 2:15.

00:14:40,563 --> 00:14:44,667
Well, if he did just meet her,
he's a pretty smooth operator.

00:14:44,733 --> 00:14:46,202
Bailed her out,
bought her lunch,

00:14:46,268 --> 00:14:48,737
and still had some coins left
over to play the slots.

00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:50,106
Classic lake date.

00:14:54,743 --> 00:14:56,278
Boy meets girl...

00:14:56,345 --> 00:14:57,880
girl ends up dead.

00:15:02,418 --> 00:15:04,019
Mrs. Winston?

00:15:04,086 --> 00:15:06,956
I asked my husband
to do one thing.

00:15:07,022 --> 00:15:09,325
One thing.

00:15:09,391 --> 00:15:11,594
I got up early.

00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,930
I fed Joshua.

00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:18,234
I got him changed, dressed.

00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:23,739
All he had to do
was drop him off.

00:15:23,806 --> 00:15:27,676
WILLOWS:
You flew to Los Angeles,
Mrs. Winston?

00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,845
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:15:29,912 --> 00:15:33,215
I had, uh, business in Anaheim.

00:15:33,282 --> 00:15:34,784
I'm in horticulture.

00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:35,985
My company is

00:15:36,051 --> 00:15:38,854
designing a garden
for a new hotel.

00:15:38,921 --> 00:15:40,856
How'd you get to the airport?

00:15:40,923 --> 00:15:43,359
I drove my car.

00:15:43,426 --> 00:15:45,895
I'm assuming you have
a baby seat in your vehicle.

00:15:45,961 --> 00:15:48,130
Of course.

00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,465
It's the law.

00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:50,733
I...

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,102
I put it in Paul's car
before I left.

00:15:57,973 --> 00:16:00,576
Mrs. Winston, did...

00:16:00,643 --> 00:16:02,645
Joshua have a cold?

00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:05,548
He had a slight cough.

00:16:05,614 --> 00:16:09,351
There was a bug going
around daycare.

00:16:09,418 --> 00:16:11,387
Did you give him
anything for it?

00:16:11,454 --> 00:16:13,122
Cough syrup.

00:16:13,189 --> 00:16:14,490
Last night.

00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:16,058
How about this morning?

00:16:20,129 --> 00:16:22,665
There's a rule in our house
that only one parent

00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:24,266
medicates the child.

00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:26,602
But I told Paul
to go ahead

00:16:26,669 --> 00:16:30,639
and give it to Joshua
if he was still coughing.

00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,243
Why?

00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:37,079
Thanks for coming in.
We're all done.

00:16:37,146 --> 00:16:39,215
Thank you.

00:16:54,029 --> 00:16:56,198
Vicky...
What is wrong
with you?!

00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,701
How could you leave
him in the car?!

00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:00,102
What is wrong with you?!

00:17:00,169 --> 00:17:02,938
( <i>sobbing</i> )

00:17:12,181 --> 00:17:13,549
Mr. Young, your son
was last seen

00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:15,184
with a young girl.

00:17:15,251 --> 00:17:16,919
We know that he rented
a Waverunner.

00:17:16,986 --> 00:17:18,654
Now that young girl is
in our morgue

00:17:18,721 --> 00:17:20,389
and we don't know
where your son is.

00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,525
I can't believe this is
happening.

00:17:22,591 --> 00:17:24,326
Mark has a job.

00:17:24,393 --> 00:17:27,163
There's no reason for him
to be on the lake

00:17:27,229 --> 00:17:28,931
during a work day.

00:17:28,998 --> 00:17:30,499
We contacted Mark's
manager at work.

00:17:30,566 --> 00:17:31,834
He called in sick.

00:17:31,901 --> 00:17:32,835
What are you saying?

00:17:32,902 --> 00:17:34,804
That he killed this girl?
What is this?!

00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:36,939
No, no. No one's
saying that.

00:17:37,006 --> 00:17:37,940
We're just...

00:17:38,007 --> 00:17:40,109
Mr. Young, when is
the last time

00:17:40,176 --> 00:17:41,277
that you saw Mark?

00:17:41,343 --> 00:17:42,578
Yesterday morning.

00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:44,613
He came by, got something
to eat and he left.

00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,816
I mean, at this age,
I can't keep track of him.

00:17:46,882 --> 00:17:49,285
Hey, believe me,
I understand.

00:17:49,351 --> 00:17:50,619
I've been there.

00:17:50,686 --> 00:17:52,088
Mr. Stokes,

00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:54,190
my son is not a criminal.

00:17:54,256 --> 00:17:56,092
We're not saying
he's a criminal.

00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,159
All we're saying is

00:17:57,226 --> 00:17:59,195
your son had contact
with the victim

00:17:59,261 --> 00:18:00,529
and now he's missing.

00:18:00,596 --> 00:18:02,431
What we'd like to do
is get a warrant

00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,333
to search your house.

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,201
A warrant?

00:18:05,267 --> 00:18:06,735
But maybe we don't need one.

00:18:06,802 --> 00:18:08,304
If we could just come
by there

00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:10,639
and collect
some of Mark's things,

00:18:10,706 --> 00:18:12,741
uh, we could get
a DNA sample,

00:18:12,808 --> 00:18:14,376
exclude him as a suspect.

00:18:14,443 --> 00:18:17,480
You can take
whatever you want.

00:18:17,546 --> 00:18:20,616
Mark didn't hurt that girl.

00:18:27,423 --> 00:18:29,658
Go ahead, pinch him.

00:18:34,063 --> 00:18:34,997
There's no tenting.

00:18:35,064 --> 00:18:36,332
So he wasn't dehydrated.

00:18:36,398 --> 00:18:37,666
No, heat stroke.

00:18:37,733 --> 00:18:40,269
Vitreous urea nitrogen
and creatinine were normal.

00:18:40,336 --> 00:18:41,570
Same for sodium.

00:18:41,637 --> 00:18:42,905
What about drugs?

00:18:42,972 --> 00:18:44,540
Tox was negative.

00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:46,408
Heart attack?

00:18:46,475 --> 00:18:48,377
Organ was normal,
under 400 grams.

00:18:48,444 --> 00:18:50,780
Left ventricle less
than 1.5 centimeters.

00:18:50,846 --> 00:18:52,448
I've run out of questions.

00:18:52,515 --> 00:18:54,083
Well, I would've missed
this one

00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:55,317
if it weren't for you.

00:18:56,819 --> 00:18:59,221
Oh, you sectioned off
that fingertip bruise.

00:18:59,288 --> 00:19:01,323
Look at the scope.

00:19:04,193 --> 00:19:06,228
The skin cells look
stressed out.

00:19:06,295 --> 00:19:07,630
It's called
nuclear streaming.

00:19:07,696 --> 00:19:09,265
It occurs
when an electric current

00:19:09,331 --> 00:19:10,900
passes through tissue.

00:19:10,966 --> 00:19:12,201
He was electrocuted.

00:19:12,268 --> 00:19:14,437
But how come there's
no burn marks?

00:19:14,503 --> 00:19:15,871
Low-power shock.

00:19:15,938 --> 00:19:17,540
Uh, current crossed the heart.

00:19:17,606 --> 00:19:18,874
No damage to the muscle,

00:19:18,941 --> 00:19:20,309
but havoc on the rhythm.

00:19:20,376 --> 00:19:23,179
<i>Ventricular fibrillation.</i>

00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:26,982
<i>A precision clock becomes</i>
<i>a bag of worms.</i>

00:19:29,718 --> 00:19:31,954
All it takes is
a little current.

00:19:32,021 --> 00:19:33,989
And a point of contact.

00:19:34,056 --> 00:19:37,426
The substance on her hips
is suntan lotion.

00:19:37,493 --> 00:19:40,329
Waterproof, zinc oxide,
high SPF.

00:19:40,396 --> 00:19:42,498
Well, that's odd.

00:19:42,565 --> 00:19:44,166
The victim had a deep,
even tan.

00:19:44,233 --> 00:19:46,335
We collected low SPF oil
from the locker.

00:19:46,402 --> 00:19:49,371
It's a simple transfer--
him to her.

00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:54,643
What about the green substance
in the head wound?

00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:55,744
Mm.

00:19:57,713 --> 00:20:00,950
Navicula, Hannaea,
Achnanthes, Cymbella.

00:20:01,016 --> 00:20:02,585
Algae.

00:20:02,651 --> 00:20:04,186
Yeah, not the
free-swimming kind.

00:20:04,253 --> 00:20:05,955
These are epilithic diatoms.

00:20:06,021 --> 00:20:07,289
Attached to rocks.

00:20:07,356 --> 00:20:08,491
Girl's out at the lake.

00:20:08,557 --> 00:20:10,192
She meets some random guy
she knows nothing about

00:20:10,259 --> 00:20:11,193
and she goes off with him.

00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,995
She places herself
in a bad situation.

00:20:13,062 --> 00:20:14,263
WILLOWS:
<i>And bad things happen.</i>

00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:15,664

00:20:26,408 --> 00:20:28,811
A Waverunner...
point and throttle.

( <i>sighs</i> )

00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,881
We have no idea
where they went.

00:20:31,947 --> 00:20:34,083
Heard you guys narrowed
your search area

00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,818
to 44 square miles.

00:20:35,885 --> 00:20:37,920
That could take like months.

00:20:39,555 --> 00:20:40,723
And I'm sure you're here

00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:42,324
to shed some light
on the situation.

00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:46,095
Your case is
a boy-girl thing, right?

00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:48,664
Right.
Mm-hmm.

00:20:48,731 --> 00:20:51,000
Body was washed up
near Windmill Cove?

00:20:51,066 --> 00:20:55,171
These two coves to the north--
Cotton Wood Island, Tequila--

00:20:55,237 --> 00:20:56,505
huge make-out spots.

00:20:56,572 --> 00:20:58,541
But nearly impossible
to get to by land.

00:20:58,607 --> 00:21:01,577
And how would you know that,
Greg?

00:21:01,644 --> 00:21:03,012
A gentleman never tells.

00:21:03,078 --> 00:21:04,380
Anyway, I thought
that would be

00:21:04,447 --> 00:21:05,581
a good place to start.

00:21:05,648 --> 00:21:08,150
If you guys need
an extra set of hands...

00:21:08,217 --> 00:21:10,920
Uh, no. No.
I think we got it, boss.

00:22:18,888 --> 00:22:20,823
"Howard Aston Winston."

00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,151
<i>Reporting the record number of...</i>

00:22:30,218 --> 00:22:32,253
<i>still advises all citizens</i>
<i>to stay hydrated and...</i>

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,788
I got
the state medical records

00:22:33,855 --> 00:22:37,291
for Howard Ashton Winston--
born August 12, 2000.

00:22:37,358 --> 00:22:38,793
Would've been
three years old.

00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:39,961
When did he die?

00:22:40,028 --> 00:22:42,463
Last year--
Tay-Sachs Disease.

00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:43,898
Oh, that's incurable.

00:22:43,965 --> 00:22:45,099
Like MS, right?

00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:47,101
Yeah, I worked with a cop
in New Jersey

00:22:47,168 --> 00:22:48,336
whose son died from it.

00:22:48,403 --> 00:22:50,738
Aw, the poor kid went blind,
couldn't swallow.

00:22:50,805 --> 00:22:53,141
In the end, he couldn't even
lift his head up.

00:22:53,207 --> 00:22:56,244
The Winstons never mentioned
they had another child.

00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:58,913
Losing one kid is tough,
but two?

00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,615
I know it.

00:23:02,617 --> 00:23:05,553
These wires are all insulated.

00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,255
No burn marks.

00:23:07,321 --> 00:23:10,258
Current didn't pass
through this chair.

00:23:10,324 --> 00:23:11,592
Whoa-ho!

00:23:11,659 --> 00:23:13,428
What you got?

00:23:13,494 --> 00:23:15,430
Ultimate power.

00:23:15,496 --> 00:23:18,766
I could program this bad boy
to make me a cup of coffee.

00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:21,336
Is there any sign
of electrical surging?

00:23:21,402 --> 00:23:25,239
Well... this remote control's
got plenty of juice, but...

00:23:25,306 --> 00:23:26,941
the board's clean,
no scoring.

00:23:27,008 --> 00:23:29,844
You know, if I had my choice
about how I was going to go out,

00:23:29,911 --> 00:23:32,246
it would not be
electrocution.

00:23:32,313 --> 00:23:35,516
I think an aneurysm
in my sleep--

00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:37,418
quick and painless.

00:23:37,485 --> 00:23:39,420
I like surprises.

00:23:44,025 --> 00:23:45,026
Bingo.

00:23:45,093 --> 00:23:46,361
Look at that.

00:23:47,895 --> 00:23:51,733
Current went through the phone.

00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:53,534
From what?
Heat lightning.

00:23:53,601 --> 00:23:57,405
Storm rolls through the desert,
sometimes it strikes in town.

00:24:00,341 --> 00:24:03,745
( <i>electrical current zapping)</i>

00:24:08,282 --> 00:24:11,019
( <i>zapping continuing</i> )

00:24:11,085 --> 00:24:12,887
( <i>groans</i> )

00:24:12,954 --> 00:24:14,922
Electrocution
through the phone line?

00:24:14,989 --> 00:24:16,024
I thought that was
a myth.

00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:17,425
This look like a myth to you?

00:24:26,768 --> 00:24:28,403
STOKES:
Nice call, Greg.

00:24:28,469 --> 00:24:30,238
There's our Waverunner.

00:24:41,182 --> 00:24:43,284
Signs of sex; no sign of blood.

00:24:43,351 --> 00:24:45,319
Half a tank of gas.

00:24:45,386 --> 00:24:48,256
Why didn't he just take this
to get out of Dodge?

00:24:48,322 --> 00:24:51,092
Well, if he leaves
the dock with Sophia,

00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:54,128
comes back alone...
somebody might notice.

00:24:54,195 --> 00:24:56,331
So...

00:24:56,397 --> 00:24:58,099
he just hoofs it out of here?

00:24:58,166 --> 00:24:59,100
How?

00:24:59,167 --> 00:25:01,602
There's an access route
about two miles east,

00:25:01,669 --> 00:25:03,271
but in this heat,
no way.

00:25:07,709 --> 00:25:09,911
Well, if you kill somebody...

00:25:09,977 --> 00:25:11,713
you find a way.

00:25:11,779 --> 00:25:13,381
Check it out.

00:25:23,091 --> 00:25:26,160
WARRICK:
Strike map from the National
Lightning Detection Network.

00:25:26,227 --> 00:25:27,795
( <i>computer beeping</i> )

00:25:27,862 --> 00:25:30,865
This is Vegas in yellow.

00:25:36,604 --> 00:25:39,374
Hasn't had a lightning strike
in three days.

00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,876
You got another theory?

00:25:41,943 --> 00:25:45,380
All I got is a fried phone.

00:25:45,446 --> 00:25:52,320
One point on the
electrical path
to ground.

00:25:52,387 --> 00:25:57,725
If the phone wasn't the way in,
maybe it was the way out.

00:25:57,792 --> 00:25:59,727
( <i>grunting</i> ):
You good on your end?

00:25:59,794 --> 00:26:00,728
Yeah, fine.

00:26:00,795 --> 00:26:02,063
All right. That's good.

00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:04,732
Good. This about it?

00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,901
Yeah.

00:26:06,968 --> 00:26:10,905
Okay... now, electricity
is fickle, right?

00:26:10,972 --> 00:26:11,906
Yeah.

00:26:11,973 --> 00:26:14,375
One centimeter can
mean the difference

00:26:14,442 --> 00:26:16,377
between a little
zap and dead.

00:26:16,444 --> 00:26:18,713
So, let's assume that
the current went out

00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:21,249
through his right index
finger and the phone.

00:26:21,315 --> 00:26:23,151
For it to cross his heart,
it must've come

00:26:23,217 --> 00:26:24,919
from the left side
of his body, right?

00:26:24,986 --> 00:26:26,754
We've ruled out the fan
and the chair.

00:26:26,821 --> 00:26:29,590
Can was in his left hand,
so...

00:26:29,657 --> 00:26:33,661
the point of entry must've been
somewhere else on his body.

00:26:41,602 --> 00:26:44,539
WARRICK:
His bare foot touched the floor.

00:27:01,322 --> 00:27:03,791
Path of least resistance.

00:27:19,007 --> 00:27:22,076
SIDLE:
That's got to be a 50-foot drop.

00:27:22,143 --> 00:27:23,311
Yeah, but when
you're young,

00:27:23,378 --> 00:27:25,046
it just looks like
a whole lot of fun.

00:27:25,113 --> 00:27:26,981
Not for Sophia.

00:27:27,048 --> 00:27:29,550
Come on, go for it.

00:27:29,617 --> 00:27:30,752
No, I don't...
It'll be a rush.

00:27:30,818 --> 00:27:31,819
I don't know.
( <i>screams</i> )

00:27:34,389 --> 00:27:35,957
( <i>water splashes</i> )

00:27:36,024 --> 00:27:38,893
Well, if that's
where she died...

00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:43,464
the evidence isn't up here.

00:27:43,531 --> 00:27:46,634
It's down there.

00:28:05,286 --> 00:28:07,255
SANDERS:
Catherine...

00:28:07,321 --> 00:28:08,756
Hey, I got your results.

00:28:08,823 --> 00:28:12,560
Found a therapeutic
level of cough syrup
in the baby's system,

00:28:12,627 --> 00:28:14,796
no more than the
recommended dosage.

00:28:14,862 --> 00:28:17,899
So, between the cough syrup
and the heat,

00:28:17,965 --> 00:28:20,001
Joshua probably fell asleep

00:28:20,068 --> 00:28:23,071
and the father forgot
that he was there.

00:28:23,137 --> 00:28:24,572
Maybe.

00:28:24,639 --> 00:28:27,275
I also found
organophosphates,

00:28:27,342 --> 00:28:30,144
more specifically
Disulfoton.

00:28:34,449 --> 00:28:36,184
Pesticides.

00:28:40,655 --> 00:28:43,658
What the hell's he doing
with pesticides in his system?

00:28:50,665 --> 00:28:52,233
( <i>locker closes</i> )

00:28:54,836 --> 00:28:56,371
( <i>doorbell rings</i> )

00:28:56,437 --> 00:29:00,241
BRASS:
Mrs. Winston, we have a warrant
to search the premises.

00:29:00,308 --> 00:29:03,511
WILLOWS:
Where do you keep
your gardening supplies?

00:29:20,395 --> 00:29:21,396
Spiral search pattern.

00:29:21,462 --> 00:29:23,231
The anchor chain is
your center point.

00:29:23,297 --> 00:29:24,632
Do a 360, then
drop your depth.

00:29:24,699 --> 00:29:27,035
Now, you're not done till
you hit the bottom, okay?

00:29:27,101 --> 00:29:29,237
SIDLE:
You're looking for anything
she might've hit her head on,

00:29:29,303 --> 00:29:30,838
probably something covered
with algae.

00:29:30,905 --> 00:29:32,907
STOKES:
Good luck.

00:30:06,774 --> 00:30:09,143
What do you got?

00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:11,112
That's got to be Mark Young.

00:30:14,849 --> 00:30:16,584
Yeah.

00:30:22,857 --> 00:30:24,125
Mr. and Mrs. Winston,

00:30:24,192 --> 00:30:26,361
why don't we get
out of this heat?

00:30:34,302 --> 00:30:35,636
Why didn't you tell us

00:30:35,703 --> 00:30:37,905
you had another child
who also died?

00:30:37,972 --> 00:30:41,142
How dare you bring up Howard.

00:30:41,209 --> 00:30:42,744
I'm a mother in mourning.

00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:44,679
I've already buried one child.

00:30:44,746 --> 00:30:46,147
I have to bury another.

00:30:46,214 --> 00:30:47,648
One was in God's hands,

00:30:47,715 --> 00:30:50,551
the other in the <i>incapablehands</i>
of my husband.

00:30:50,618 --> 00:30:51,986
Show some compassion.

00:30:52,053 --> 00:30:53,788
I'm not the guilty one here!

00:30:53,855 --> 00:30:55,790
I'm guilty.

00:30:55,857 --> 00:30:58,526
I'm not a bad parent;
I was negligent.

00:30:58,593 --> 00:31:01,596
I take full responsibility
for what I did,

00:31:01,662 --> 00:31:03,765
but leave Howard
out of it.

00:31:03,831 --> 00:31:07,301
We found pesticides
in Joshua's bloodstream.

00:31:07,368 --> 00:31:09,037
I'm going to have
to get a court order

00:31:09,103 --> 00:31:10,872
and exhume the body
of your first child.

00:31:10,938 --> 00:31:12,273
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:17,445
Vicky and I went through hell
watching Howard deteriorate.

00:31:17,512 --> 00:31:20,181
Can't you let my boy rest
in peace?

00:31:20,248 --> 00:31:23,117
I'm afraid not.

00:31:28,022 --> 00:31:31,559
ROBBINS:
With exhumations, you always
hope for a good embalmer,

00:31:31,626 --> 00:31:33,127
and I think we've got one.

00:31:33,194 --> 00:31:36,130
Body's well-preserved.

00:31:36,197 --> 00:31:38,633
Tay-Sachs is a genetic disorder.

00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:41,135
You see
the retarded musculature?

00:31:41,202 --> 00:31:43,071
Classic symptom.

00:31:43,137 --> 00:31:46,441
Night and day,
compared to Joshua.

00:32:09,497 --> 00:32:11,432
Quite a lot
of Vitreous Fluid left.

00:32:11,499 --> 00:32:13,001
I stand corrected--

00:32:13,067 --> 00:32:14,802
<i>great</i> embalmer.

00:32:18,506 --> 00:32:19,874
Run this?

00:33:12,827 --> 00:33:15,029
( <i>whirring and clicking</i> )

00:33:23,838 --> 00:33:26,774
No cough syrup.
No pesticides.

00:33:26,841 --> 00:33:28,876
Traces of monocycline.

00:33:28,943 --> 00:33:30,912
Anti-inflammatory.

00:33:30,978 --> 00:33:34,782
Sometimes prescribed
for Tay-Sachs.

00:33:34,849 --> 00:33:36,250
Well, it's the same principle

00:33:36,317 --> 00:33:38,386
of giving marijuana
to glaucoma patients--

00:33:38,453 --> 00:33:40,388
doesn't really cure
the vision problems;

00:33:40,455 --> 00:33:41,556
it just buys you time.

00:33:41,622 --> 00:33:42,557
Band-Aid.

00:33:42,623 --> 00:33:43,558
Yeah.

00:33:43,624 --> 00:33:45,326
Maybe the Winstons
didn't want Howard

00:33:45,393 --> 00:33:46,527
to suffer.

00:33:46,594 --> 00:33:49,731
So, they don't kill
their first child, who's dying.

00:33:49,797 --> 00:33:52,400
Why kill the second child,
who's healthy?

00:33:58,668 --> 00:34:00,936
So both Howard
and Joshua Winston

00:34:01,003 --> 00:34:02,672
were patients
of yours?

00:34:02,738 --> 00:34:05,574
Yes. I was with them
when Howard died.

00:34:05,641 --> 00:34:07,810
That was a dark time for them.

00:34:07,877 --> 00:34:09,078
And, I must say,

00:34:09,145 --> 00:34:10,846
it took a lot of
courage for them
to try again.

00:34:10,913 --> 00:34:13,482
And since both
parents carry the
Tay-Sachs allele,

00:34:13,549 --> 00:34:16,686
there was a 25% that the second
child would be born with it.

00:34:16,752 --> 00:34:20,456
But Joshua dodged the bullet.

00:34:20,523 --> 00:34:22,725
We tested Vicki early in
the second trimester;

00:34:22,792 --> 00:34:24,327
the results
came back negative.

00:34:26,862 --> 00:34:28,297
Had you seen Joshua recently?

00:34:28,364 --> 00:34:30,733
A couple days
before he died.

00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,702
It was a regular checkup, or...?

00:34:32,768 --> 00:34:36,339
No. Vicki called in a panic,
said something was wrong.

00:34:36,405 --> 00:34:38,507
I told her to bring
him right in.

00:34:38,574 --> 00:34:41,177
<i>And despite the fetal test,</i>
<i>Joshua seemed to be exhibiting</i>

00:34:41,243 --> 00:34:43,346
<i>all the classic signs</i>
<i>of early Tay-Sachs.</i>

00:34:43,412 --> 00:34:46,148
<i>Floppiness, poor head control,</i>
<i>unable to turn over,</i>

00:34:46,215 --> 00:34:47,550
<i>decreased muscle tone.</i>

00:34:47,616 --> 00:34:50,519
<i>When they brought him in</i>
<i>it was Howard all over again.</i>

00:34:50,586 --> 00:34:53,989
The only conclusion was that the
fetal test was a false negative.

00:34:54,056 --> 00:34:56,359
What are the odds?

00:34:56,425 --> 00:34:57,693
Under one percent.

00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,262
When I saw Joshua's retinas
there were red spots--

00:35:00,329 --> 00:35:01,330
classic Tay-Sachs.

00:35:01,397 --> 00:35:03,499
I sent out an enzyme
test to confirm it.

00:35:03,566 --> 00:35:05,501
And did you confirm it?

00:35:05,568 --> 00:35:07,103
Results haven't come back yet.

00:35:09,572 --> 00:35:11,407
ROBBINS:
Mark Young.

00:35:11,474 --> 00:35:15,111
Cause of death is asphyxia
due to fresh water drowning.

00:35:15,177 --> 00:35:17,446
No bruises or other injuries.

00:35:17,513 --> 00:35:21,384
Except for a ruptured
tympanic membrane.

00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:22,485
Hmm.

00:35:25,488 --> 00:35:27,423
Hmm.

00:35:29,225 --> 00:35:30,760
Tear's red.

00:35:30,826 --> 00:35:31,961
It's ragged.

00:35:32,028 --> 00:35:33,229
Ante-mortem injury.

00:35:33,295 --> 00:35:34,697
In water, burst eardrums

00:35:34,764 --> 00:35:36,799
typically result
from rapid decent.

00:35:36,866 --> 00:35:39,869
Sudden changes in pressure
without equalizing.

00:35:39,935 --> 00:35:41,270
STOKES:
<i>She went in first.</i>

00:35:41,337 --> 00:35:43,906
( <i>screaming</i> )

00:35:47,843 --> 00:35:49,278
Whoo-hoo!

00:35:51,547 --> 00:35:54,617
<i>And he jumped in after her.</i>

00:36:28,517 --> 00:36:30,953
This was an accident, Sara.

00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:33,222
He was trying to save her.

00:36:33,289 --> 00:36:34,357
That's a great theory.

00:36:34,423 --> 00:36:35,624
But we can't prove that.

00:36:35,691 --> 00:36:37,927
26 feet under with
a busted eardrum?

00:36:37,994 --> 00:36:39,562
If not to save her,
why dive that deep?

00:36:39,628 --> 00:36:40,997
I don't know.

00:36:42,999 --> 00:36:44,934
Case is over.

00:36:45,001 --> 00:36:46,168
Almost over.

00:36:46,235 --> 00:36:48,471
BROWN:
Found this mineral residue

00:36:48,537 --> 00:36:51,507
that led all the way
from the massage chair

00:36:51,574 --> 00:36:55,845
to this burnt-out power strip
across the room... water stain.

00:36:55,911 --> 00:36:57,380
Well, there's
your conductor.

00:36:57,446 --> 00:36:59,715
I also found them
on the cookie sheet

00:36:59,782 --> 00:37:02,651
and this water-damaged magazine
right here.

00:37:02,718 --> 00:37:07,256
And I found this plastic bag
in the kitchen garbage.

00:37:09,392 --> 00:37:11,961
"Ice Block."

00:37:12,028 --> 00:37:13,663
Add that with the fan,

00:37:13,729 --> 00:37:15,865
you got yourself
a homemade swamp cooler.

00:37:34,216 --> 00:37:36,285
( <i>electrical crackling</i> )

00:37:39,255 --> 00:37:40,990
( <i>groaning</i> )

00:37:41,057 --> 00:37:43,225
Inventive.

00:37:43,292 --> 00:37:45,394
Guy was just trying
to stay cool.

00:37:52,234 --> 00:37:53,903
Thanks.

00:37:53,969 --> 00:37:56,005
No,
it's my pleasure.

00:38:00,042 --> 00:38:01,010
Hey, Nick.

00:38:01,077 --> 00:38:02,044
Hey.

00:38:02,111 --> 00:38:03,646
What are you doing?

00:38:03,713 --> 00:38:05,581
What do you mean?

00:38:05,648 --> 00:38:07,216
What did you
tell him?

00:38:07,283 --> 00:38:08,918
His son died a hero?

00:38:08,984 --> 00:38:11,120
Look, I'm just trying
to give the guy
a little peace, you know?

00:38:11,187 --> 00:38:12,788
Oh, well, who
are you trying

00:38:12,855 --> 00:38:14,724
to help feel better,
him or you?

00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:16,559
Hey, let me
ask you something, Sara:

00:38:16,625 --> 00:38:17,960
you're Mr. Young,

00:38:18,027 --> 00:38:20,529
would you rather know this much
or nothing at all?

00:38:20,596 --> 00:38:23,666
You know, if the evidence
doesn't support the answer,

00:38:23,733 --> 00:38:25,935
a CSI shouldn't be
asking that question.

00:38:26,002 --> 00:38:27,770
Well, okay,
if that works for you.

00:38:27,837 --> 00:38:29,605
Be careful.

00:38:50,459 --> 00:38:52,561
I was in the garden
this weekend.

00:38:52,628 --> 00:38:55,598
Why are you so interested
in everything we do?

00:38:55,665 --> 00:38:58,668
I mean, when did
our lives become
an open book?

00:38:58,734 --> 00:39:02,738
When your second son
ended up dead.

00:39:02,805 --> 00:39:05,441
When you were in the garden,
was Joshua with you?

00:39:05,508 --> 00:39:06,876
No.

00:39:06,942 --> 00:39:08,511
Yes, he was.

00:39:08,577 --> 00:39:09,879
We had a fight...

00:39:09,945 --> 00:39:11,013
Vicky, it's your turn.

00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,982
I've had him for
the past four hours.

00:39:13,049 --> 00:39:14,784
What, are you
counting hours now?

00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:16,385
He's your son.

00:39:16,452 --> 00:39:18,888
Look, if you're not gardening
here, then it's at work.

00:39:18,954 --> 00:39:20,289
I've had him all day.
It's your turn.

00:39:20,356 --> 00:39:22,725
Here. Thank you.

00:39:22,792 --> 00:39:24,460
See the pretty flowers, Joshua?

00:39:26,529 --> 00:39:27,930
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:39:27,997 --> 00:39:29,398
I guess he was.

00:39:29,465 --> 00:39:32,835
But the moment he
passed Joshua off
to me I went inside.

00:39:32,902 --> 00:39:34,437
Did you wash your hands?

00:39:34,503 --> 00:39:37,106
Honestly, I don't remember.

00:39:37,173 --> 00:39:38,374
I'm in the garden a lot,

00:39:38,441 --> 00:39:39,942
so I'm sure I
washed my hands.

00:39:40,009 --> 00:39:43,145
Well, I met with your
pediatrician, Dr. Garner.

00:39:43,212 --> 00:39:44,780
When you brought
Joshua in

00:39:44,847 --> 00:39:47,116
on that emergency call,
it was because

00:39:47,183 --> 00:39:48,951
you feared that

00:39:49,018 --> 00:39:51,120
he, too, had Tay-Sachs.

00:39:51,187 --> 00:39:53,389
PAUL:
We had the test
before he was born.

00:39:53,456 --> 00:39:55,958
Dr. Garner said we were fine.

00:39:56,025 --> 00:39:57,126
I can imagine for both of you

00:39:57,193 --> 00:39:58,995
it must have been like
reliving the nightmare.

00:39:59,061 --> 00:40:01,998
One child, now two.

00:40:02,064 --> 00:40:05,201
WILLOWS:
Did you know

00:40:05,267 --> 00:40:08,104
that repeated exposure
to certain pesticides,

00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:09,572
even in small amounts,

00:40:09,638 --> 00:40:12,041
can have an adverse effect
in infants?

00:40:12,108 --> 00:40:14,243
Even mimic the signs
of Tay-Sachs?

00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:16,312
BRASS:
The symptoms are similar.

00:40:16,379 --> 00:40:19,181
Floppiness of the head,
arching of the back.

00:40:19,248 --> 00:40:20,649
Blindness...

00:40:20,716 --> 00:40:23,119
inability to swallow.
You know, like that.

00:40:23,185 --> 00:40:25,488
WILLOWS:
You work with pesticides,
Mrs. Winston,

00:40:25,554 --> 00:40:27,923
on your job
and in your garden.

00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:29,558
And you handled Joshua--

00:40:29,625 --> 00:40:31,694
we suspect that that's how

00:40:31,761 --> 00:40:34,163
the traces
got into his system.

00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:36,098
I'm just speculating here,

00:40:36,165 --> 00:40:38,968
but I think this is
what happened next:

00:40:39,035 --> 00:40:41,504
No, Paul. I went
through hell with Howard,

00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:42,972
I can't go through
that with Joshua.

00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:44,607
We'll wait for the enzyme tests.

00:40:44,674 --> 00:40:47,677
No. No more tests.
No more drugs.

00:40:47,743 --> 00:40:49,078
No more kids.

00:40:49,145 --> 00:40:50,179
No more!

00:40:50,246 --> 00:40:52,481
I can't live through that again,

00:40:52,548 --> 00:40:54,917
and neither can you.

00:40:58,788 --> 00:41:03,326
WILLOWS:
You gave Joshua
cough syrup, Mr. Winston.

00:41:03,392 --> 00:41:05,394
Why did you medicate him?

00:41:05,461 --> 00:41:10,199
BRASS:
'Cause, maybe, you just
didn't want him to suffer?

00:41:28,217 --> 00:41:29,852
( <i>car alarm squeals</i> )

00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,290
( <i>softly cries</i> )

00:41:39,161 --> 00:41:41,897
You have no idea

00:41:41,964 --> 00:41:46,102
what it's like to
watch your child die.

00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:49,572
We couldn't
go through that again.

00:41:51,874 --> 00:41:53,342
WILLOWS:
The shame of it is

00:41:53,409 --> 00:41:55,945
you didn't have to.

00:41:56,012 --> 00:41:57,179
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:41:57,246 --> 00:42:01,117
The enzyme test that Dr. Garner
ran came back negative.

00:42:03,552 --> 00:42:06,055
Joshua didn't have Tay-Sachs.

00:42:09,392 --> 00:42:12,128
You killed
a perfectly healthy baby.
