00:00:10,192 --> 00:00:12,512
I'm going to make this really simple.

00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:14,014
Who are you workin' with?

00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:17,484
I'm, uh, unemployed
at the moment.

00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:18,485
You got any idea

00:00:18,552 --> 00:00:20,687
what we did to chumps
like you back in the day?

00:00:22,456 --> 00:00:23,557
Uh, no.

00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:26,426
Look, could you put the A.C. on
in here

00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:27,427
or somethin'?

00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:28,829
That, or just, uh,

00:00:28,895 --> 00:00:30,297
let me go.

00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:31,965
I mean, you can't keep me
in here.

00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,033
It's against the law.

00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,403
There's no law
in this room.

00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,776
You can't touch me.

00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:48,782
Two shots to the back
of the head.

00:00:48,849 --> 00:00:50,250
Double tap.

00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:56,490
He's wearing a wig

00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:58,558
and a fat suit.

00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:00,494
It's not Halloween, is it?

00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,429
In this town,
it's always Halloween.

00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:06,500
BRASS:
"Ernie Menlo."

00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:09,136
Well, he wasn't carrying

00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:10,637
a very "fat" wad.

00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:12,873
CATHERINE:
Rolex is still on his wrist.

00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:14,374
Probably rules out
robbery.

00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:16,476
What do you think?

00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:17,878
I don't know.

00:01:22,315 --> 00:01:24,217
I'm looking for a sign.

00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:34,094

He's not in the system?

00:01:57,738 --> 00:01:59,440
Yeah... gotta be.

00:01:59,506 --> 00:02:01,642
Okay. Thanks.

00:02:03,055 --> 00:02:04,289
So, uh...

00:02:04,356 --> 00:02:06,324
Brass ran the ID.

00:02:06,391 --> 00:02:08,660
There's no "Ernie Menlo"
in the system.

00:02:08,727 --> 00:02:10,796
Fake.

00:02:10,862 --> 00:02:12,764
GRISSOM:
GSR in the wound track.

00:02:12,831 --> 00:02:15,033
No stellate tearing.

00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,469
Gunshots appear
to be close range,

00:02:17,536 --> 00:02:20,405
but noncontact.

00:02:23,508 --> 00:02:25,477
PHILLIPS:
No exit wounds.

00:02:25,544 --> 00:02:29,114
Well, I don't see
any shell casings either.

00:02:29,181 --> 00:02:31,483
So maybe the killer

00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,118
picked them up.

00:02:33,185 --> 00:02:34,486
Professional hit?

00:02:36,488 --> 00:02:38,290
PHILLIPS:
Major fractures and lacerations

00:02:38,356 --> 00:02:40,092
on his hands.

00:02:40,158 --> 00:02:41,793
Lividity's consistent
with body position.

00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,628
I don't think
it was a body dump.

00:02:43,695 --> 00:02:44,930
So either he walked in

00:02:44,996 --> 00:02:45,997
or he got a ride.

00:02:46,064 --> 00:02:47,766
Either way,
this gravel and glass

00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:49,201
makes good evidence.

00:02:50,669 --> 00:02:52,604
GRISSOM:
I'll go ahead and bag a sample.

00:03:37,816 --> 00:03:41,119
GRISSOM:
"Rampart Casino."

00:03:41,186 --> 00:03:42,554
Well, his day started out good.

00:03:42,621 --> 00:03:46,525
He won $436,278.

00:03:46,591 --> 00:03:49,027
Rampart's always been lucky
for me.

00:03:49,094 --> 00:03:51,596
So where
is this money?

00:04:00,939 --> 00:04:02,908
I found some tire treads.

00:04:02,974 --> 00:04:04,776
I think the vehicle
was making a three-point turn.

00:04:04,843 --> 00:04:08,346
And it seems that robbery
may be a motive after all.

00:04:10,482 --> 00:04:12,384
CATHERINE:
Wow!

00:04:12,451 --> 00:04:13,585
"Rampart."

00:04:13,652 --> 00:04:16,188
Guess I'll go check that out.

00:04:16,254 --> 00:04:17,389
You can't.

00:04:17,456 --> 00:04:18,957
We found the body

00:04:19,024 --> 00:04:20,358
under the Whiskey
Town sign

00:04:20,425 --> 00:04:22,861
and the guy
just cleaned out
the Rampart Casino.

00:04:22,928 --> 00:04:24,629
Coincidence.

00:04:24,696 --> 00:04:26,698
Even if it is,
they're still
Sam Braun's casinos.

00:04:26,765 --> 00:04:28,100
Why is that a problem?

00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:29,601
He's your father.

00:04:29,668 --> 00:04:31,703
You can't be
on this case.

00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:33,739
Gil...
Catherine,

00:04:33,805 --> 00:04:35,707
you have to go home.

00:05:21,386 --> 00:05:22,821
No ticks.
It's authentic.

00:05:26,591 --> 00:05:28,293
Logo sticker isn't worn down.

00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,494
Watch could be new.

00:05:29,561 --> 00:05:31,763
Guy hits the jackpot,
has to celebrate.

00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,532
Goes and buys
some bling-bling

00:05:33,598 --> 00:05:35,000
to impress
the strippers with.

00:05:36,101 --> 00:05:37,502
What have you got?

00:05:39,037 --> 00:05:41,440
Air conditioned socks.

00:05:43,008 --> 00:05:46,278
♪ ... I can hear the sound
of violins ♪

00:05:46,344 --> 00:05:47,379
Insurance?

00:05:47,446 --> 00:05:51,049
♪ Long before it begins... ♪

00:05:51,116 --> 00:05:54,553
Dealer wins.

00:05:54,619 --> 00:05:55,587
CROUPIER:
Seven!

00:05:55,654 --> 00:05:57,055
( <i>players groan</i> )

00:06:03,328 --> 00:06:06,398
24 is even.

00:06:14,773 --> 00:06:16,975
So, I talked
to the pit boss

00:06:17,042 --> 00:06:18,443
who signed the vic's W-2.

00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:19,644
He was pulling surveillance.

00:06:19,711 --> 00:06:20,645
He remembers

00:06:20,712 --> 00:06:21,780
the big winner.

00:06:23,181 --> 00:06:25,150
Sam Braun!

00:06:25,217 --> 00:06:26,251
What a surprise!

00:06:28,019 --> 00:06:31,390
The fat kid...
he was cheating.

00:06:31,456 --> 00:06:33,191
What do you do about it?

00:06:33,258 --> 00:06:34,393
Well, we had
a little chat.

00:06:34,459 --> 00:06:36,061
I didn't kill him.

00:06:36,128 --> 00:06:37,896
Did you take him to the box?

00:06:37,963 --> 00:06:40,932
Gentlemen, these
days, we call it
the holding room.

00:06:49,307 --> 00:06:52,377
Smells like
the cleaning crew
just left.

00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,890
Security brought
the kid

00:07:04,956 --> 00:07:07,526
down here around 2:00 a.m.

00:07:07,592 --> 00:07:08,727
I came in.

00:07:08,794 --> 00:07:10,095
We talked.

00:07:10,162 --> 00:07:12,764
He walked out around 3:00.

00:07:15,634 --> 00:07:17,436
It's all in there.

00:07:17,502 --> 00:07:18,837
Well, good.

00:07:18,904 --> 00:07:20,605
We'll look at the tapes
a little later.

00:07:20,672 --> 00:07:22,174
Would you turn off
the lights, please?

00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:29,548
It's well within my rights
to have a discussion

00:07:29,614 --> 00:07:31,583
with anyone
in my place.

00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:34,286
The kid was cheating.

00:07:34,352 --> 00:07:36,388
I wanted to know how.

00:07:36,455 --> 00:07:39,791
Nobody wins 400K at roulette.

00:07:39,858 --> 00:07:41,460
What's your system?

00:07:41,526 --> 00:07:44,129
Clean living... good karma.

00:07:44,196 --> 00:07:45,630
But either you call
the cops

00:07:45,697 --> 00:07:47,933
and book me now,
or I'm out of here.

00:07:47,999 --> 00:07:50,802
You're no longer welcome
at the Rampart.

00:07:50,869 --> 00:07:52,704
Awesome.

00:07:52,771 --> 00:07:55,307
Okay, I'll take
my money and go.

00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:57,709
Do you have any idea

00:07:57,776 --> 00:08:00,712
the house advantage
in roulette?

00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:03,248
5.26%

00:08:03,315 --> 00:08:05,617
Albert Einstein
had a theory

00:08:05,684 --> 00:08:07,152
about roulette.

00:08:07,219 --> 00:08:08,820
He said the only way
to win at roulette

00:08:08,887 --> 00:08:10,355
is to steal the money
from the table

00:08:10,422 --> 00:08:11,823
when the croupier
isn't looking.

00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:14,526
There's always someone looking.

00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:21,733
GRISSOM:
Well, maybe it was
an inside job, Sam.

00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,403
Maybe somebody bought off
one of your guys.

00:08:25,804 --> 00:08:27,806
I'm curious.

00:08:27,873 --> 00:08:29,608
What bothers you more?

00:08:29,674 --> 00:08:31,943
The fact that you couldn't
pin a murder on me

00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:34,880
or that Catherine
cashed my check?

00:08:39,251 --> 00:08:41,753
There were no strings
on that money.

00:08:43,755 --> 00:08:46,124
Just because you can't
see something

00:08:46,191 --> 00:08:47,692
doesn't mean
it's not there.

00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:50,429
Believe whatever you like.

00:08:50,495 --> 00:08:53,465
That kid walked out
of here with my money.

00:08:53,532 --> 00:08:55,500
If you figure out

00:08:55,567 --> 00:08:58,737
how he ripped me off,
would you let me know?

00:09:02,107 --> 00:09:03,241
ROBBINS:
For what it's worth,

00:09:03,308 --> 00:09:05,911
these bruises correspond
to the holes in his sock.

00:09:05,977 --> 00:09:08,914
Well, he's been worked over
pretty good.

00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,315
He's got a
nice fat lip.

00:09:10,382 --> 00:09:12,517
Yeah.

00:09:12,584 --> 00:09:13,985
There was a good clot
in the wound,

00:09:14,052 --> 00:09:14,986
and the tissues

00:09:15,053 --> 00:09:16,221
were contused.

00:09:16,288 --> 00:09:18,190
I'd say it occurred
at least an hour

00:09:18,256 --> 00:09:19,991
or two before death.

00:09:20,058 --> 00:09:21,093
I teased out

00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:23,929
a couple of small-
caliber projectiles

00:09:23,995 --> 00:09:26,698
from his brain.

00:09:26,765 --> 00:09:29,434
One was embedded
in the right

00:09:29,501 --> 00:09:30,836
frontal cortex.

00:09:30,902 --> 00:09:33,038
The other lodged in the
first cervical vertebra.

00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:35,107
It's copper-washed
lead.

00:09:35,173 --> 00:09:37,075
Must be a .22.

00:09:37,142 --> 00:09:38,510
You know,
historically,

00:09:38,577 --> 00:09:41,413
.22s were the hit man's
bullet of choice.

00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,882
<i>They have the energy to enter</i>
<i>into the cranial vault,</i>

00:09:43,949 --> 00:09:46,351
<i>but not enough to exit,</i>
<i>so they just ricochet around</i>

00:09:46,418 --> 00:09:48,954
inside, shredding
the gray matter until they stop.

00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,789
Nice.

00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:53,592
There's also extensive
crush injury to both hands,

00:09:53,658 --> 00:09:56,194
with fractures of
the metacarpals

00:09:56,261 --> 00:09:57,396
and the phalanges.

00:09:57,462 --> 00:09:59,030
Bruises appear perimortem.

00:09:59,097 --> 00:10:02,134
Any idea what might have caused
that kind of damage?

00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,735
Given the
fracture pattern,

00:10:03,802 --> 00:10:06,304
I'd guess it was some
sort of blunt object.

00:10:06,371 --> 00:10:09,474
Maybe
a ball peen hammer.

00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:10,542
What gets you to that?

00:10:10,609 --> 00:10:12,377
They used to tell me
back in the days,

00:10:12,444 --> 00:10:13,912
the first time
you got caught cheating,

00:10:13,979 --> 00:10:15,647
they'd give you
a couple whacks on the hand

00:10:15,714 --> 00:10:16,648
with a ball peen hammer.

00:10:16,715 --> 00:10:18,083
Ow.

00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,818
The second time,
you'd lose a limb.

00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:21,119
Third time?

00:10:21,186 --> 00:10:24,322
A long walk in the desert
with a shovel.

00:11:00,525 --> 00:11:01,727
A computer in his shoe.

00:11:01,793 --> 00:11:04,429
As far as I could tell,
it's a wireless receiver.

00:11:04,496 --> 00:11:05,630
It picks up a signal,

00:11:05,697 --> 00:11:08,533
solenoids drive the points
up against the guy's foot,

00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,135
tells him
what number to bet.

00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:11,336
Based on what?

00:11:11,403 --> 00:11:12,571
I don't know.

00:11:12,637 --> 00:11:13,905
Archie's working on it
right now.

00:11:13,972 --> 00:11:15,574
Well, if our vic
was the receiver,

00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,042
there has to be
a transmitter.

00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:18,677
Hey, I got an ID on our vic.

00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:19,778
A Teddy Keller.

00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,146
Everyone who buys a Rolex

00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:23,415
gets registered
at the point of purchase.

00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:24,816
So I ran the serial number.

00:11:24,883 --> 00:11:27,486
He bought the watch
at the Forum Shops two days ago.

00:11:27,552 --> 00:11:29,488
And I got his home address.

00:11:29,554 --> 00:11:32,023
Well, his driver's
license was fake,

00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:33,992
so, this could
be fake, too.

00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:35,560
A fake ID
is for scamming a casino.

00:11:35,627 --> 00:11:38,363
A baller puts his real name
on a Roley.

00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:40,866
What? He rubs off.

00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,169
MAN:
Teddy Keller.

00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:46,705
That's Apartment 27.

00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:48,874
Is he in some kind of trouble?

00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,776
Hey, John.
Hey, Mr. Green.

00:11:50,842 --> 00:11:52,511
When was the last time
you saw him?

00:11:52,577 --> 00:11:53,845
I don't know.

00:11:53,912 --> 00:11:55,814
He's got a roommate--
Davis Mullens.

00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:56,982
Oh, yeah, they eat

00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,284
a tremendous amount of pizza.

00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:01,319
Tremendous amount of pizza

00:12:01,386 --> 00:12:02,621
and calzone.

00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:05,424
I feel like bopping
that delivery guy

00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:07,726
every time he
buzzes the gate.

00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:08,827
Here we are.

00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,228
( <i>knocking at door</i> )

00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:13,098
Anybody home?

00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:14,766
( <i>knocking</i> )

00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:16,802
Hello?

00:12:16,868 --> 00:12:19,104
I guess the roommate's out, huh?

00:12:27,612 --> 00:12:29,614
It's freezing in here.

00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:35,420
Get a load
of this wheel.

00:12:36,688 --> 00:12:39,057
It's regulation.

00:12:39,124 --> 00:12:41,660
These things run
about 1,500 bucks.

00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:44,596
Well, they cleared
almost half a mil.

00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:46,498
It's a good investment.

00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:48,033
Yeah.

00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:59,845
These guys
definitely had a system.

00:13:01,261 --> 00:13:03,930
Hey, Rick, you might want
to check this out.

00:13:13,707 --> 00:13:15,642
Looks like the roommate's home
after all.

00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,488
Two taps to the head.

00:13:23,857 --> 00:13:25,125
Deja vu.

00:13:34,368 --> 00:13:36,770
These guys liked to play
dress-up.

00:13:36,837 --> 00:13:38,338
You find any shoes
back there?

00:13:43,277 --> 00:13:44,478
I'm looking.

00:13:49,383 --> 00:13:50,951
Blood smear here.

00:13:54,021 --> 00:13:55,422
Maybe the killer tried
to clean up.

00:13:56,757 --> 00:13:57,691
That's ridiculous.

00:13:57,758 --> 00:13:59,093
Why bother?

00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:00,894
Okay.

00:14:00,961 --> 00:14:04,031
Have a distinctive white mark
on his right shoulder.

00:14:06,633 --> 00:14:08,635
What do you make of that?

00:14:08,702 --> 00:14:10,571
You already shot me down once.

00:14:10,637 --> 00:14:13,574
Look, uh, it could be right.

00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,675
Thanks.

00:14:14,742 --> 00:14:16,477
Can you make sure
that gets to Trace?

00:14:16,543 --> 00:14:18,379
Yeah. Sure.

00:14:22,716 --> 00:14:24,385
Hey, what're you doing,
touching that?

00:14:24,451 --> 00:14:25,786
You got gloves?

00:14:25,853 --> 00:14:28,389
Relax. I got
it covered.

00:14:28,455 --> 00:14:30,190
Hey, Rick, remember
the time you said

00:14:30,257 --> 00:14:32,259
you could get
a print off of air?

00:14:32,326 --> 00:14:33,694
Yeah.

00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:14,268
So you just got
the day off?

00:15:14,334 --> 00:15:16,036
Just... Just like that?

00:15:16,103 --> 00:15:17,237
Are you complaining?

00:15:17,304 --> 00:15:18,739
No.

00:15:18,806 --> 00:15:23,444
You just seem a little
pissed off about it.

00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:25,112
I like it.

00:15:26,346 --> 00:15:27,614
You like that?

00:15:29,917 --> 00:15:31,085
Depends on what you're
gonna do with it.

00:15:32,453 --> 00:15:35,422
Pretty expensive taste
for a public servant.

00:15:35,489 --> 00:15:37,191
She can afford it.

00:15:38,792 --> 00:15:40,094
You going to introduce him?

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,562
Mr. Braun.

00:15:41,628 --> 00:15:43,263
Chris Bezich.

00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:44,565
It's a pleasure
to meet you.

00:15:44,631 --> 00:15:45,666
Your hosts,

00:15:45,733 --> 00:15:47,434
send a lot of your whales
to my club, Acid Drop.

00:15:47,501 --> 00:15:49,370
That's great.

00:15:49,436 --> 00:15:51,138
Just give us a minute.

00:15:51,205 --> 00:15:53,040
Okay.

00:15:53,107 --> 00:15:54,742
What do you want?

00:15:54,808 --> 00:15:57,511
Mugs, I heard
you had some time off
because of me.

00:15:57,578 --> 00:16:00,180
I could get fired for even
having this conversation.
Relax.

00:16:00,247 --> 00:16:01,849
Vegas is a small town.

00:16:01,915 --> 00:16:03,684
I'm always running into people
I know.

00:16:03,751 --> 00:16:05,452
Just cut to the chase, Sam.

00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,056
Some people in this town
think I'm a murderer.

00:16:09,123 --> 00:16:11,959
Some people in this town
know you're a murderer.

00:16:12,026 --> 00:16:13,193
I did not kill those kids.

00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,228
I did not!
Kids?

00:16:14,294 --> 00:16:16,030
How do you know
there's more than one?

00:16:16,096 --> 00:16:17,431
Cath...

00:16:17,498 --> 00:16:19,533
I'm fine.

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,268
You're not impressing her.

00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,438
I'll be in touch.

00:16:44,725 --> 00:16:46,293
<i>You and Sam Braun...</i>

00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,129
He slept with my mother.

00:16:49,196 --> 00:16:51,765
HODGES:
The glass fragments you found
at the apartment building

00:16:51,832 --> 00:16:53,233
are primarily lead-based.

00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,935
Different curvatures
and textures

00:16:55,002 --> 00:16:57,438
with traces of
florescent powder,
phosphorus

00:16:57,504 --> 00:16:58,439
and mercury.

00:16:58,505 --> 00:16:59,840
Neon glass.

00:16:59,907 --> 00:17:01,208
I checked out
that graveyard once.

00:17:01,275 --> 00:17:03,110
Pretty interesting.

00:17:03,177 --> 00:17:05,112
The comparison?

00:17:05,179 --> 00:17:07,181
Your sample's consistent
with the glass collected

00:17:07,247 --> 00:17:08,382
from the first crime scene.

00:17:08,449 --> 00:17:09,450
See?

00:17:09,516 --> 00:17:10,751
That connects the two murders.

00:17:10,818 --> 00:17:13,220
We've got a timeline.

00:17:14,288 --> 00:17:15,522
Hey.

00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:16,824
Hey.

00:17:21,428 --> 00:17:22,996
Everything okay?

00:17:23,063 --> 00:17:25,132
This is about the key
CSI position.

00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:26,734
Grissom recommended me.

00:17:28,702 --> 00:17:30,637
Congratulations.

00:17:30,704 --> 00:17:33,140
It's not necessary.

00:17:33,207 --> 00:17:34,341
Position was cut.

00:17:34,408 --> 00:17:36,477
Budget had room
for the new promotion

00:17:36,543 --> 00:17:38,312
or a new Qiagen,

00:17:38,379 --> 00:17:40,347
Bio Robot EZ-1.

00:17:40,414 --> 00:17:42,316
Greg will be thrilled.

00:17:42,383 --> 00:17:44,118
Yeah.

00:17:45,252 --> 00:17:48,355
Oh, well, it's just an honor
to be nominated, right?

00:17:51,959 --> 00:17:55,162
Grissom, I have been in Vegas
my whole life.

00:17:55,229 --> 00:17:56,497
I've known guys
who counted cards,

00:17:56,563 --> 00:17:58,699
hedged bets,

00:17:58,766 --> 00:18:02,036
crushed a poker table
with a lowball pair.

00:18:02,102 --> 00:18:04,538
I've seen guys beat the
house with their hands...

00:18:04,605 --> 00:18:07,074
but never with their toes.

00:18:08,976 --> 00:18:12,012
Transmitter and receiver.

00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:14,681
I was reading about
these Silicon Valley
types in the '80s

00:18:14,748 --> 00:18:17,451
called the...
Eudaemonic Enterprises.

00:18:17,518 --> 00:18:19,253
Have you heard of them?

00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:20,754
The Eudaemon.

00:18:20,821 --> 00:18:24,725
Aristotle's presiding
spirit of rationality.

00:18:24,792 --> 00:18:27,461
They say they figured
out a way to beat
the roulette wheel.

00:18:27,528 --> 00:18:30,597
Not through a betting system,
but through physics.

00:18:30,664 --> 00:18:33,100
It's simple in principle.

00:18:33,167 --> 00:18:35,903
A fixed mass in a known orbit.

00:18:35,969 --> 00:18:38,839
<i>As long as you can account</i>
<i>for all the forces--</i>

00:18:38,906 --> 00:18:40,774
<i>air resistance, friction,</i>
<i>gravity--</i>

00:18:40,841 --> 00:18:42,710
<i>you can land a probe on Mars.</i>

00:18:42,776 --> 00:18:45,212
WARRICK:
<i>Every roulette wheel</i>
<i>is a little different.</i>

00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:47,581
<i>Tilt, wobble, bounce...</i>

00:18:47,648 --> 00:18:51,485
<i>The guy with the transmitter</i>
<i>does the calibration,</i>

00:18:51,552 --> 00:18:54,588
<i>clocks the position of the</i>
<i>ball,</i>

00:18:54,655 --> 00:18:57,291
<i>hits the switch...</i>

00:18:57,358 --> 00:18:59,259
<i>and the computer does the rest.</i>

00:18:59,326 --> 00:19:00,894
<i>Plays out the spin</i>
<i>in milliseconds,</i>

00:19:00,961 --> 00:19:03,964
<i>Predicts the result,</i>
<i>then transmits a code</i>

00:19:04,031 --> 00:19:06,633
<i>to the receiver about</i>
<i>where that ball will land.</i>

00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,635
All right, big money,
big money!

00:19:08,702 --> 00:19:10,571
$1,000 on four, 22, five and 17.

00:19:10,637 --> 00:19:13,974
It's number 22.

00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:16,443
( <i>cheering</i> )

00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:19,380
This setup gives you
a 44-percent advantage
over the house.

00:19:19,446 --> 00:19:21,382
For every hundred
these guys bet,

00:19:21,448 --> 00:19:25,152
they're pulling in $2,200
an hour.

00:19:25,219 --> 00:19:26,687
Nice return.

00:19:26,754 --> 00:19:28,555
But it's a complicated system.

00:19:28,622 --> 00:19:29,990
STOKES:
Complicated, huh?

00:19:30,057 --> 00:19:31,859
Maybe for a couple
of pizza majors.

00:19:31,925 --> 00:19:34,628
But not for an electrical
engineering grad student.

00:19:34,695 --> 00:19:36,997
AFIS got a hit on the print
off the transmitter

00:19:37,064 --> 00:19:38,165
in the shoe.

00:19:38,232 --> 00:19:41,568
Seth Landers. WLVU.

00:19:41,635 --> 00:19:44,304
Got busted a few years
ago for making fake IDs.

00:19:48,709 --> 00:19:49,843
BRASS:
<i>Seth Landers</i>

00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:50,944
doesn't have a roommate.

00:19:51,011 --> 00:19:52,780
No answer at his door.

00:19:52,846 --> 00:19:54,248
Guy's in the wind.

00:19:54,314 --> 00:19:56,650
If someone hit my
boys all mob-style

00:19:56,717 --> 00:19:57,918
I'd disappear, too,
you know?

00:19:57,985 --> 00:20:00,354
Yeah, I guess we're gonna
have to do this the hard way.

00:20:00,421 --> 00:20:02,056
I'll put out a broadcast.

00:20:02,122 --> 00:20:03,190
Wait a minute.

00:20:03,257 --> 00:20:04,925
Hey, kid...

00:20:04,992 --> 00:20:05,993
you know Seth Landers?

00:20:07,828 --> 00:20:09,329
Uh-oh.

00:20:14,001 --> 00:20:15,369
Stop!

00:20:20,207 --> 00:20:21,809
Don't kill me!
Don't kill me!

00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:24,044
Please! I'll do whatever
Mr. Braun wants!

00:20:24,111 --> 00:20:25,779
Please don't kill me!
Please!
Las Vegas Police.

00:20:25,846 --> 00:20:27,047
You Seth Landers?
Yeah.

00:20:27,114 --> 00:20:28,048
Seth Landers?
Yes!

00:20:28,115 --> 00:20:29,249
Let's go.

00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:35,832
BRASS:
Jacking Sam Braun's
casino at roulette--

00:20:35,899 --> 00:20:37,834
that was gutsy... and smart.

00:20:38,972 --> 00:20:41,441
And since you weren't
the one placing the bet,

00:20:41,508 --> 00:20:43,743
I guess that makes
you the smart one.

00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:46,846
BROWN:
Your boys
right here--

00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:49,349
Teddy and Davis,
the candid camera.

00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,751
They came to <i>me.</i>
It was their idea.

00:20:51,818 --> 00:20:55,255
Judging from what we
found in your apartment,

00:20:55,321 --> 00:20:57,323
looks like you made
their idea work.

00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:59,159
I built the computers
to put in the shoes.

00:20:59,225 --> 00:21:00,527
That's all.

00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:02,095
BRASS:
Your partners
cleared half a mil

00:21:02,162 --> 00:21:03,563
on your skills.

00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:06,132
Dollar signs get involved,
things get ugly, huh?

00:21:06,199 --> 00:21:09,069
Scam was 20 to 30K
a night, max.

00:21:09,135 --> 00:21:11,504
We hit Pike's.
Next day, Tangiers.

00:21:11,571 --> 00:21:13,073
Everything was great.

00:21:13,139 --> 00:21:14,841
We made 50 grand,

00:21:14,908 --> 00:21:18,578
and then Teddy and Davis
got greedy.

00:21:18,645 --> 00:21:20,580
You can't crush a roulette table
like that,

00:21:20,647 --> 00:21:23,583
and not expect someone
to notice.

00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,485
The Tangiers, Pike's, Rampart...

00:21:25,552 --> 00:21:27,420
these are all
Sam Braun's places.

00:21:27,487 --> 00:21:29,222
You got something against him?

00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:30,523
No.

00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:32,258
His casinos are old school.

00:21:32,325 --> 00:21:33,793
They're low tech.

00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:36,096
There's less interference
for my gear.

00:21:36,162 --> 00:21:37,797
Your gear...

00:21:39,866 --> 00:21:41,000
What was your cut?

00:21:41,067 --> 00:21:42,635
I didn't get one.
I just got paid

00:21:42,702 --> 00:21:44,671
for my supplies and my time.
That's all.

00:21:44,738 --> 00:21:46,673
( <i>scoffing</i> ):
Yeah, picture that!

00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,007
It was a challenge.
I just wanted

00:21:48,074 --> 00:21:49,309
to see if I could make it work.

00:21:49,376 --> 00:21:51,177
Any idea where the money is?

00:21:51,244 --> 00:21:53,179
Why don't you ask Sam Braun?

00:21:56,349 --> 00:21:58,852
<i>When they took Teddy</i>
<i>to the "box,"</i>

00:21:58,918 --> 00:22:00,253
<i>I was sure we were busted.</i>

00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,823
<i>Davis freaked.</i>
<i>He split.</i>

00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:06,159
<i>And then when he came out</i>
<i>with the money,</i>

00:22:06,226 --> 00:22:08,928
<i>everything was great.</i>

00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:11,698
<i>For about two seconds.</i>

00:22:11,765 --> 00:22:15,301
<i>They grabbed him</i>
<i>and led him outside.</i>

00:22:15,368 --> 00:22:18,304
That was the last time
I saw either one of them.

00:22:21,508 --> 00:22:22,976
( <i>insistent knocking</i> )

00:22:26,446 --> 00:22:28,381
What are you doing?

00:22:28,448 --> 00:22:31,251
I'm testing
my podiatric dexterity.

00:22:31,317 --> 00:22:33,353
What are you doing?

00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:36,022
Uh, you know those tracks that
we found at the neon graveyard?

00:22:36,089 --> 00:22:39,626
The ones from the case
you're <i>not</i> working on?

00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:41,828
Yeah, those.

00:22:41,895 --> 00:22:43,863
Sam...

00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:45,331
used to be a Caddy man.

00:22:45,398 --> 00:22:47,600
He would drive a
new one every year.

00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:49,536
These days, he's being driven.

00:22:49,602 --> 00:22:51,371
And you know this
because...?

00:22:51,438 --> 00:22:52,439
I saw him.

00:22:52,505 --> 00:22:54,007
He came to me.

00:22:54,074 --> 00:22:55,442
And you walked away,
I hope.

00:22:55,508 --> 00:22:57,277
I <i>made</i> him walk away
from me.

00:22:57,343 --> 00:23:01,214
Right into a stretch limo
with a big turning radius.

00:23:01,281 --> 00:23:02,882
That doesn't prove anything.

00:23:02,949 --> 00:23:05,985
Besides, any evidence
that comes from you is tainted.

00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:07,554
Then have it come
from you.

00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,255
Warrant shouldn't be hard
to get.

00:23:09,322 --> 00:23:11,391
Especially if the call comes
from someone

00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:13,259
whose character is
above reproach.

00:23:30,471 --> 00:23:32,907
Nick said the budget
for the promotion was cut.

00:23:32,973 --> 00:23:35,409
240 inches-- 20 feet.

00:23:35,476 --> 00:23:37,912
He also said
you recommended him.

00:23:41,482 --> 00:23:43,117
I did.

00:23:50,224 --> 00:23:53,227
Possible neon glass fragment.

00:24:20,087 --> 00:24:22,256
You said you didn't have
a problem with me.

00:24:23,924 --> 00:24:25,326
I don't.

00:24:26,827 --> 00:24:31,265
I thought that Nick was the best
candidate for the position.

00:24:33,067 --> 00:24:35,169
Why?

00:24:36,804 --> 00:24:40,908
Because he didn't
care whether he got
the job or not.

00:24:40,975 --> 00:24:43,410
That's a stupid reason.

00:24:50,084 --> 00:24:52,386
We've got blood.

00:24:58,325 --> 00:25:00,294
Handle your scandal.

00:25:04,532 --> 00:25:06,433
Sam Braun?

00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,103
You're under arrest
for the murder of Teddy Keller.

00:25:09,169 --> 00:25:11,805
Is this some kind of joke?

00:25:11,872 --> 00:25:13,407
I'm not laughing.

00:25:15,476 --> 00:25:19,046
Call my lawyer.
This won't take long.

00:25:20,114 --> 00:25:20,915
Sam?

00:25:22,683 --> 00:25:24,351
I'm parked out front.

00:25:43,704 --> 00:25:47,174
As much as my client appreciates
your flair for the dramatic,

00:25:47,241 --> 00:25:48,809
the show's over, gentlemen.

00:25:48,876 --> 00:25:50,477
What do you have?

00:25:50,544 --> 00:25:53,080
The tire patterns at the scene
of Teddy Keller's murder

00:25:53,147 --> 00:25:54,648
are consistent
with the wheel base

00:25:54,715 --> 00:25:56,850
and turning radius of
your client's limousine.

00:25:56,917 --> 00:26:00,487
As well as
every other limo in Vegas.

00:26:00,554 --> 00:26:03,157
We also found neon glass
embedded in all four tires.

00:26:03,224 --> 00:26:04,959
LAWYER:
The whole town's
a construction site.

00:26:05,025 --> 00:26:06,560
It's a tenuous link, at best.

00:26:06,627 --> 00:26:09,697
Well, then...
how did his blood end up

00:26:09,763 --> 00:26:12,967
in the back
of your client's limousine?

00:26:13,033 --> 00:26:15,336
BRASS:
You waited until

00:26:15,402 --> 00:26:17,738
Teddy cleared
the security cameras...

00:26:17,805 --> 00:26:19,907
( <i>grunting</i> )

00:26:22,443 --> 00:26:24,144
We're not through talking, kid.

00:26:24,211 --> 00:26:26,580
And then you took him
for a ride...

00:26:26,647 --> 00:26:27,915
Vegas style.

00:26:27,982 --> 00:26:30,751
Just like
the old days.

00:26:37,858 --> 00:26:39,860
( <i>panting</i> )

00:26:39,927 --> 00:26:42,930
Let me show you
what I do to cheaters.

00:26:42,997 --> 00:26:43,731
( <i>panting rapidly</i> )

00:26:43,797 --> 00:26:46,567
( <i>wailing</i> ):
No, no!

00:26:54,041 --> 00:26:56,510
My client offered the young man
a ride home.

00:26:56,577 --> 00:26:59,013
They stopped briefly
at the neon graveyard,

00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:01,215
where they held
a private conversation

00:27:01,282 --> 00:27:03,584
regarding the ethics
of defrauding a casino.

00:27:03,651 --> 00:27:04,885
( <i>Brass chuckles</i> )

00:27:04,952 --> 00:27:07,021
That must have been
some chat.

00:27:07,087 --> 00:27:09,523
We know he left the casino
with the money.

00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:11,125
The young man returned
the money

00:27:11,192 --> 00:27:12,826
as a sign of respect
for my client

00:27:12,893 --> 00:27:14,528
and his position
in the community.

00:27:14,595 --> 00:27:16,897
I'm sure he did.

00:27:16,964 --> 00:27:18,199
So, what next?

00:27:18,265 --> 00:27:20,534
You gonna tell me
you're being set up?

00:27:20,601 --> 00:27:23,737
It happens to you a lot,
huh, Sam?

00:28:16,957 --> 00:28:19,193
Your smudge from that
second kid's shirt--

00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,828
I got a spectral
library match

00:28:20,895 --> 00:28:24,131
to Sherwin-Williams
EverClean interior
paint, Navajo White.

00:28:26,367 --> 00:28:28,269
Anything distinctive?
I would have
mentioned it.

00:28:28,335 --> 00:28:30,204
Sometimes a paint sample's
just a paint sample.

00:28:30,271 --> 00:28:31,472
Yeah.

00:28:31,539 --> 00:28:33,908
You still liking Braun
for these murders?

00:28:33,974 --> 00:28:35,643
Yeah, why? Something change?

00:28:35,709 --> 00:28:38,612
I'm thinking Seth Landers and
his pals had a woody for him.

00:28:38,679 --> 00:28:41,515
I went back to the
Rampart, and I took

00:28:41,582 --> 00:28:43,851
some electronic
noise measurements.

00:28:43,918 --> 00:28:46,287
The place is a mess
of interference.

00:28:46,353 --> 00:28:48,422
Electronics in
old casinos
aren't shielded.

00:28:48,489 --> 00:28:49,657
So, you're saying

00:28:49,723 --> 00:28:51,659
that the shoe computers
would've worked better

00:28:51,725 --> 00:28:53,360
in one of the new casinos
on the Strip?

00:28:53,427 --> 00:28:55,829
Definitely.
A kid as smart as Seth

00:28:55,896 --> 00:28:58,299
wouldn't make a mistake
like that.

00:28:58,365 --> 00:29:00,167
Then it was intentional.

00:29:01,702 --> 00:29:03,170
Maybe personal.

00:29:38,172 --> 00:29:40,507
( <i>coins feeding</i> )

00:29:45,012 --> 00:29:47,281
So, this is your
casino of choice?

00:29:47,348 --> 00:29:49,450
That's what your
tenants said.

00:29:49,516 --> 00:29:51,185
Sir, could you tell us
about Seth Landers?

00:29:51,252 --> 00:29:54,388
That's my son.
Is he okay?

00:29:54,455 --> 00:29:55,789
( <i>sighing</i> )

00:29:55,856 --> 00:29:59,627
Let's stop playing dumb,
Mr. Greene, huh?

00:29:59,693 --> 00:30:01,662
Would you mind
stepping away from the machine?

00:30:01,729 --> 00:30:04,098
You're staring over my shoulder,
you're looking at me.

00:30:04,164 --> 00:30:05,900
You're jinxing me,
and I'm gonna have to...

00:30:05,966 --> 00:30:07,568
How's that? Is that better?

00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:11,739
What happened to your hand?

00:30:11,805 --> 00:30:14,275
I had an accident
a long time ago.

00:30:14,341 --> 00:30:15,943
Sam Braun do that
with a hammer?

00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:17,878
I'm sorry, I don't know
who that person is.

00:30:17,945 --> 00:30:19,246
Who is that?

00:30:19,313 --> 00:30:21,048
I don't like to talk
about my hand, okay?

00:30:21,115 --> 00:30:22,483
BRASS:
Well, that's too bad.

00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:24,285
'Cause you know what?

00:30:24,351 --> 00:30:28,222
Today... this is your life.

00:31:04,385 --> 00:31:08,322
BRASS:
Joe Greene-- AKA Joe Landers.

00:31:08,389 --> 00:31:10,091
They're old friends.

00:31:12,794 --> 00:31:14,429
Sorry to break up
the reunion, fellas.

00:31:14,495 --> 00:31:16,597
Mr. Greene... Mr. Landers...

00:31:16,664 --> 00:31:18,166
Which is it?
It's Greene.

00:31:18,232 --> 00:31:20,234
Come with me.

00:31:21,002 --> 00:31:23,104
Do your hands hurt

00:31:23,171 --> 00:31:24,872
when it rains, Joe?

00:31:26,741 --> 00:31:29,310
Do I know you?

00:31:38,286 --> 00:31:41,422
The exclusion/exemption clause
means you don't get to gamble.

00:31:41,489 --> 00:31:42,557
Period.

00:31:42,623 --> 00:31:44,625
Not even the quarter
slots at the Gas-and-Go.

00:31:44,692 --> 00:31:48,096
Don't you have
something better to do?

00:31:48,162 --> 00:31:50,364
Like find out who murdered

00:31:50,431 --> 00:31:52,133
those two kids in number 27.

00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,568
You got any theories?

00:31:53,634 --> 00:31:55,570
It was your apartment building.

00:31:55,636 --> 00:31:58,539
Your son Seth fingered the guy
you were sitting next to.

00:31:58,606 --> 00:31:59,740
A guy you don't know.

00:31:59,807 --> 00:32:01,909
The guy who put you in
the Black Book.

00:32:01,976 --> 00:32:06,247
No. The Gaming Commission
put me in the Black Book.

00:32:06,314 --> 00:32:07,415
Yeah, for cheating, Joe.

00:32:07,482 --> 00:32:08,716
I did not cheat.

00:32:09,717 --> 00:32:10,752
I did not cheat.

00:32:10,818 --> 00:32:13,454
I didn't have
to cheat.

00:32:13,521 --> 00:32:15,923
I beat the casinos.

00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:18,860
I beat 'em, and they ganged up
on me, and, uh...

00:32:18,926 --> 00:32:21,796
that was it, they didn't want
me there anymore.

00:32:21,863 --> 00:32:23,931
You beat Sam Braun's casino

00:32:23,998 --> 00:32:26,534
and he ended
your gambling career.

00:32:26,601 --> 00:32:29,637
You're barred from the casinos
for life.

00:32:29,704 --> 00:32:31,539
That sounds like
motive to me.

00:32:31,606 --> 00:32:34,308
Motive for what,
playing the quarter slots?

00:32:34,375 --> 00:32:35,610
Come on.

00:32:35,676 --> 00:32:39,781
Okay, look, here's a quiz.

00:32:39,847 --> 00:32:43,151
Teddy Keller,
Davis Mullins
and your son Seth

00:32:43,217 --> 00:32:44,886
were caught fleecing
the Rampart.

00:32:44,952 --> 00:32:46,187
Now two of 'em are dead.

00:32:46,254 --> 00:32:49,056
I had no idea what
those two boys were doing.

00:32:49,123 --> 00:32:50,758
But I will tell you this--

00:32:50,825 --> 00:32:53,661
I will tell you that my son is
a good kid, he's a good boy.

00:32:53,728 --> 00:32:56,063
Then why'd you put him
in the middle of your action?

00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:58,032
Why'd you use him
to settle an old score?

00:32:58,099 --> 00:33:00,802
Maybe Sam Braun's innocent.

00:33:00,868 --> 00:33:04,572
Maybe Seth whacked his partners
because he got caught.

00:33:04,639 --> 00:33:07,375
Stop looking at my son,

00:33:07,442 --> 00:33:09,710
stop looking at me,

00:33:09,777 --> 00:33:13,448
and start looking at Sam.

00:33:16,084 --> 00:33:18,886
MAN:
Garbage detail
called it in.

00:33:18,953 --> 00:33:21,322
Says they
didn't touch it.

00:33:23,624 --> 00:33:26,627
Well, this is
Seth Landers' dorm.

00:33:28,496 --> 00:33:29,864
There's a lot
of garbage build up.

00:33:29,931 --> 00:33:31,032
When was the last pick-up?

00:33:31,099 --> 00:33:33,201
Day before yesterday.

00:33:33,267 --> 00:33:34,902
End of finals party last night.

00:33:34,969 --> 00:33:35,970
Looks like blood.

00:33:36,037 --> 00:33:38,606
Let's hope the killer left
his DNA behind.

00:33:38,673 --> 00:33:41,008
.22 revolver,

00:33:41,075 --> 00:33:43,211
two live rounds, four expended.

00:33:43,277 --> 00:33:46,180
Should be able to pull
some prints off it.

00:33:46,247 --> 00:33:48,616
Gun's a relic.

00:33:48,683 --> 00:33:50,918
Doesn't matter
if it still works.

00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:04,499
There you go.

00:34:13,775 --> 00:34:16,878
The test fire matches the bullet
found in Teddy Keller's body.

00:34:16,944 --> 00:34:18,913
So we've got
our murder weapon.

00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:21,282
Yeah, we found
our murder weapon.

00:34:21,349 --> 00:34:22,517
I don't know.

00:34:22,583 --> 00:34:24,152
The kid thinks up

00:34:24,218 --> 00:34:28,289
this elaborate scheme
to cheat the casinos.

00:34:28,356 --> 00:34:30,958
Then he kills his partners.

00:34:31,025 --> 00:34:32,593
But he dumps his gun
at his dorm?

00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:33,661
An RG .22.

00:34:33,728 --> 00:34:36,097
That's not a very bad ass'
first weapon of choice.

00:34:36,164 --> 00:34:37,999
No, it's a small caliber weapon

00:34:38,065 --> 00:34:40,001
for an up-close-and-personal
hit.

00:34:40,067 --> 00:34:41,569
I don't really see

00:34:41,636 --> 00:34:43,204
the kid pulling a Gotti.

00:34:43,271 --> 00:34:44,439
Okay, two victims,

00:34:44,505 --> 00:34:46,307
two taps to the head.

00:34:46,374 --> 00:34:48,843
But the loads are different.

00:34:48,910 --> 00:34:50,211
Well, maybe he ran
out of ammo.

00:34:50,278 --> 00:34:51,779
Went back and bought
another brand.

00:34:51,846 --> 00:34:53,581
And reloaded, yeah.

00:34:53,648 --> 00:34:58,186
The bullets that were found
in Teddy Keller's skull,

00:34:58,252 --> 00:35:01,689
were copper washed
CCI .22s.

00:35:01,756 --> 00:35:04,092
And the two rounds found
in Davis Mullins

00:35:04,158 --> 00:35:05,860
were Remington brass washed.

00:35:05,927 --> 00:35:08,963
So, based on
the position
of the cylinder

00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:12,533
Remingtons were fired first?

00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,076
But that would mean that
Davis Mullins was killed

00:35:22,143 --> 00:35:24,679
in the apartment
before Teddy Keller was killed

00:35:24,745 --> 00:35:25,713
in the Graveyard.

00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:26,814
The timeline's off.

00:35:28,449 --> 00:35:31,586
Blood on the shirt
is a match to Davis Mullins.

00:35:31,652 --> 00:35:33,821
Epithelials from
inside the shirt

00:35:33,888 --> 00:35:36,257
belong to Seth Landers.

00:35:40,261 --> 00:35:42,096
What?

00:35:42,163 --> 00:35:45,967
That means Sam Braun's
innocent. This time.

00:35:46,033 --> 00:35:49,403
Are you disappointed?

00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:51,806
It's the evidence.

00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:57,512
What's up, man?

00:35:57,578 --> 00:35:59,547
Am I going
to get out of here?

00:35:59,614 --> 00:36:00,882
No.

00:36:00,948 --> 00:36:03,351
Where did you go after
Teddy Keller was taken?

00:36:03,418 --> 00:36:06,387
You know what, you keep on
asking me all these questions,

00:36:06,454 --> 00:36:09,424
but my lawyer says I'm not even
supposed to talk to you.

00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:11,259
Okay, you don't have
to talk to me.

00:36:11,325 --> 00:36:14,395
But you got to know you're
looking at two counts of murder.

00:36:14,462 --> 00:36:15,496
What?

00:36:15,563 --> 00:36:17,432
I didn't kill anybody.

00:36:17,498 --> 00:36:18,666
This is crazy.

00:36:18,733 --> 00:36:19,901
Then talk to me.

00:36:19,967 --> 00:36:21,636
Tell me what happened.

00:36:21,702 --> 00:36:23,704
Where did you go?
For real.

00:36:23,771 --> 00:36:26,707
I waited outside
the casino for an hour.

00:36:26,774 --> 00:36:30,077
Teddy didn't show up
so I went to his place.

00:36:30,144 --> 00:36:32,146
Davis, where are you, man?

00:36:32,213 --> 00:36:33,414
Braun got Teddy.

00:36:33,481 --> 00:36:35,083
Davis, wake up, man!

00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,894
We found the murder weapon

00:36:46,961 --> 00:36:49,030
that was used to kill
your two partners.

00:36:49,097 --> 00:36:53,034
It was wrapped
in your bloody T-shirt.

00:36:53,101 --> 00:36:54,735
Can you tell me about that?

00:36:54,802 --> 00:36:59,407
I have never used
a gun in my life.

00:36:59,474 --> 00:37:04,378
It was found outside
of your campus apartment.

00:37:04,445 --> 00:37:07,415
That can't be.

00:37:07,482 --> 00:37:09,450
Can be.

00:37:09,517 --> 00:37:11,686
Unless you clear it up.

00:37:11,753 --> 00:37:15,490
Um...

00:37:15,556 --> 00:37:16,891
The rule was

00:37:16,958 --> 00:37:19,894
that if something
went wrong,

00:37:19,961 --> 00:37:23,598
we were supposed
to just go home.

00:37:23,664 --> 00:37:27,001
Uh... so I found the body,

00:37:27,068 --> 00:37:29,504
got blood all over my shirt,

00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:31,606
so... I gave it to my dad.

00:37:31,672 --> 00:37:33,574
I gave my dad the shirt.

00:37:33,641 --> 00:37:34,909
He's the one who had the shirt.

00:37:34,976 --> 00:37:36,110
Dad! Dad!

00:37:36,177 --> 00:37:38,312
Davis... Davis is dead.

00:37:38,379 --> 00:37:40,915
I think they got
Teddy, too.

00:37:40,982 --> 00:37:41,916
Braun's on to us.

00:37:41,983 --> 00:37:43,084
What am I
going to do?

00:37:43,151 --> 00:37:44,519
Give me your shirt.

00:37:44,585 --> 00:37:46,421
Go back to school
and lay low.

00:37:48,723 --> 00:37:53,694
Are you trying to tell me
that your own father set you up?

00:37:59,167 --> 00:38:02,036
The truth is, I just wanted
him to like me.

00:38:04,705 --> 00:38:05,873
But I'm not him.

00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:08,643
You know, I'm never going
to be him.

00:38:08,709 --> 00:38:11,612
Counting cards
and the poker face.

00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:18,252
They say it's a skill,
but it's a gift.

00:38:18,319 --> 00:38:20,621
Till Sam Braun took it away.

00:38:20,688 --> 00:38:24,459
So you went after Sam Braun to
prove something to your old man.

00:38:24,525 --> 00:38:27,595
I mean, I went after the whale,

00:38:27,662 --> 00:38:29,597
but I skinned it.

00:38:29,664 --> 00:38:32,033
I did
what my dad could never do.

00:38:38,473 --> 00:38:40,708
Does your father own a .22?

00:38:52,453 --> 00:38:54,088
I got nothing.

00:39:01,562 --> 00:39:04,332
Maybe he was expecting us.

00:39:04,398 --> 00:39:06,234
You think he cleaned up?

00:39:13,307 --> 00:39:14,642
Well, if he did...

00:39:14,709 --> 00:39:16,611
he missed a spot.

00:39:36,497 --> 00:39:38,433
Nice and new in here.

00:39:43,171 --> 00:39:45,139
Sherwin Williams,

00:39:45,206 --> 00:39:47,642
latex flat.

00:39:47,708 --> 00:39:51,646
Navajo White.
What do you know. 

00:39:51,712 --> 00:39:53,047
Same as the paint

00:39:53,114 --> 00:39:56,084
on the shirt.

00:40:06,694 --> 00:40:10,498
What's in the bag, Dad?

00:40:10,565 --> 00:40:11,933
Money from...

00:40:11,999 --> 00:40:13,768
the Tangiers...

00:40:13,835 --> 00:40:17,238
Money from Pike's.

00:40:17,305 --> 00:40:19,507
Bet there's 50 grand in there.

00:40:21,609 --> 00:40:23,277
Plus...

00:40:23,344 --> 00:40:26,881
what could be paint
and blood smears.

00:40:28,316 --> 00:40:29,584
That blood could match

00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:31,185
the stains we found
on Davis' shirt.

00:40:31,252 --> 00:40:33,087
I don't understand why

00:40:33,154 --> 00:40:34,722
he had to kill his kids.

00:40:34,789 --> 00:40:37,759
They were making a lot
of money off of Braun.

00:40:37,825 --> 00:40:39,627
Dad was getting his revenge.

00:40:39,694 --> 00:40:43,297
My guess, stopped being
about the money.

00:40:43,364 --> 00:40:44,999
( <i>phone ringing</i> )
Yeah.

00:40:45,066 --> 00:40:46,000
Hey, Joe, it's Teddy.

00:40:46,067 --> 00:40:47,001
Oh, hi, Teddy.

00:40:47,068 --> 00:40:48,703
Sam's on to us.
He took me to Neon Graveyard.

00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:49,704
Slow down, slow down.

00:40:49,771 --> 00:40:50,738
I had to give him the money.

00:40:50,805 --> 00:40:51,973
I thought he was going
to kill me.

00:40:52,039 --> 00:40:53,441
Don't move. I'll be there
in a minute.

00:41:03,918 --> 00:41:05,520
Mr. Greene,
what's up, man?

00:41:05,586 --> 00:41:06,554
Hey...

00:41:06,621 --> 00:41:07,889
Hey...

00:41:07,955 --> 00:41:10,925
( <i>gunshots</i> )

00:41:15,596 --> 00:41:17,064
Why settle for the money,

00:41:17,131 --> 00:41:20,101
when you can frame up
your worst enemy for murder.

00:41:23,104 --> 00:41:26,040
Hey, what the hell
took you so long?

00:41:26,107 --> 00:41:29,277
Joe... Joe we
got a problem.

00:41:29,343 --> 00:41:31,212
Sam... Sam he...

00:41:31,279 --> 00:41:33,014
Turn around and walk.

00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,916
( <i>gunshots</i> )

00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:04,779
Sam.

00:42:07,615 --> 00:42:10,318
Could I buy you some dinner?

00:42:10,384 --> 00:42:12,253
Feeling a little guilty?

00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:15,823
Hey, Sam, where's
the ice?

00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:17,692
BRAUN:
Next to the TV, kid.

00:42:24,298 --> 00:42:28,102
You want to catch a cheater--
hire one.

00:42:28,169 --> 00:42:30,204
Right.

00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:32,406
He gets to work off his debt.

00:42:32,473 --> 00:42:37,745
On way or another, I always get
my money's worth.
