00:01:02,458 --> 00:01:03,559
Wow, that had to hurt.

00:01:09,732 --> 00:01:11,700
Well, robbery wasn't a motive.

00:01:11,767 --> 00:01:13,435
His eyes took the brunt
of the punishment.

00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:16,605
If you can't see,
you can't fight back.

00:01:17,806 --> 00:01:21,377
No. But he may have tried.

00:01:24,246 --> 00:01:25,648
Tony Sciarra.

00:01:25,714 --> 00:01:27,416
From Philadelphia.

00:01:27,483 --> 00:01:39,962
So much for brotherly love.

Our victim Tony just checked
into the hotel.

00:02:23,456 --> 00:02:24,758
He hadn't even unpacked.

00:02:24,824 --> 00:02:26,659
He made enemies fast.

00:02:26,726 --> 00:02:29,295
Yeah, old man at the casino,
who he knocked down,
said the same thing.

00:02:29,362 --> 00:02:32,365
He was hauling ass.

00:02:32,432 --> 00:02:33,867
Why?

00:02:43,376 --> 00:02:45,979
Blood drops are medium to large.

00:02:46,046 --> 00:02:49,449
Low-velocity spatter.
No castoff.

00:02:49,516 --> 00:02:52,252
Maybe he wasn't beaten
with a weapon.

00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:54,954
Hand to hand?

00:02:55,021 --> 00:03:00,160
I know this guy's yoked.
He's what? 6'2"? 6'3"?

00:03:00,226 --> 00:03:02,762
Size doesn't matter
when you're outnumbered.

00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:11,137
Damn.

00:03:16,042 --> 00:03:17,377
SIDLE:
Here's our vic.

00:03:17,444 --> 00:03:18,878
Leaving the floor.

00:03:18,945 --> 00:03:21,715
And the cameras. No eyes in
the corridors or the rest rooms.

00:03:21,781 --> 00:03:23,283
Yeah, well, we know
where he went.

00:03:23,349 --> 00:03:24,818
Just show us where
he came from, please.

00:03:37,397 --> 00:03:38,064
Whoa. Whoa.

00:03:38,131 --> 00:03:39,199
That's good.

00:03:39,265 --> 00:03:40,400
Start it from right there.

00:03:46,606 --> 00:03:48,708
Did you see that?

00:03:48,775 --> 00:03:51,010
Yeah, the little
guy on the right

00:03:51,077 --> 00:03:52,245
just snaked him.

00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,848
You've got
to be kidding me.

00:03:54,914 --> 00:03:55,915
He just did it again.

00:03:55,982 --> 00:03:57,050
Two for two.

00:03:57,117 --> 00:03:58,752
That guy has got stones

00:03:58,818 --> 00:04:01,221
going after a mark
as big as Tony.

00:04:01,287 --> 00:04:03,056
He knows he has backup.

00:04:03,123 --> 00:04:06,126
Is the third time a charm?

00:04:06,192 --> 00:04:07,694
Yes, it is.

00:04:09,262 --> 00:04:10,263
Busted.

00:04:11,998 --> 00:04:13,199
Accusations from Tony.

00:04:13,266 --> 00:04:16,169
He's getting hot.

00:04:16,236 --> 00:04:17,937
Some kind of denial
from the little guy.

00:04:18,004 --> 00:04:20,540
Tony got worked.
Just wanted his money back.

00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,909
We're going to need a still
of the little guy's face,
if you could.

00:04:22,976 --> 00:04:25,044
You got it.

00:04:27,981 --> 00:04:32,085
ROBBINS:
Fractures to the zygomatic,
ethmoidal, nasal bones.

00:04:32,152 --> 00:04:35,488
Also the maxilla and mandible.

00:04:35,555 --> 00:04:37,924
How many teeth did you
find at the scene?
Two.

00:04:39,526 --> 00:04:41,761
He's missing six.

00:04:41,828 --> 00:04:43,830
I found one in the back
of his mouth.

00:04:43,897 --> 00:04:45,965
He probably swallowed
the other three.

00:04:46,032 --> 00:04:48,701
I'll check his stomach.

00:04:48,768 --> 00:04:50,270
Blood evidence at the scene

00:04:50,336 --> 00:04:52,705
suggests that his attackers
did not use a weapon.

00:04:54,207 --> 00:04:55,675
Contusions are nondescript.

00:04:55,742 --> 00:04:57,043
No foreign tool marks.

00:04:58,411 --> 00:05:00,080
Bare knuckles?

00:05:00,146 --> 00:05:01,548
That's what I'm thinking.

00:05:01,614 --> 00:05:03,049
Multiple blows
to the head

00:05:03,116 --> 00:05:06,720
produced angular acceleration
and deceleration in the brain.

00:05:09,622 --> 00:05:13,860
<i>Twisting of the brain causes</i>
<i>the bridging veins to rip.</i>

00:05:13,927 --> 00:05:15,562
<i>From there it's all downhill.</i>

00:05:15,628 --> 00:05:18,965
<i>The axons within the white</i>
<i>matter of the brain</i>
<i>begin to snap.</i>

00:05:19,032 --> 00:05:22,368
Officially, COD is
diffuse axonal injury.

00:05:22,435 --> 00:05:23,737
Unofficially...

00:05:25,004 --> 00:05:28,875
it's the most brutal beating
I've ever seen.

00:05:28,942 --> 00:05:33,747
Neck bruises were made
by a left hand?

00:05:34,781 --> 00:05:36,916
What about these bruises?

00:05:36,983 --> 00:05:38,818
Well, there's no
defensive wounds

00:05:38,885 --> 00:05:40,253
on the hands or forearm.

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,756
So I'm guessing
it was restrained.

00:05:42,822 --> 00:05:46,259
Bruises could be somebody's
knees on his chest.

00:05:46,326 --> 00:05:49,129
So a hand on his throat,
knees on his chest,

00:05:49,195 --> 00:05:51,531
his head was butted up
against a wall,

00:05:51,598 --> 00:05:52,599
and all the blows

00:05:52,665 --> 00:05:54,601
were directed at his face.

00:05:54,667 --> 00:05:55,668
That doesn't leave much room

00:05:55,735 --> 00:05:57,470
for any other attackers
to get their licks in.

00:05:57,537 --> 00:05:59,939
Maybe there were
no other attackers.

00:06:00,006 --> 00:06:03,410
( <i>grunting, groaning</i> )

00:06:03,476 --> 00:06:05,879
One guy did all this?

00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,485
So you're sure this
was the man you saw?

00:06:12,552 --> 00:06:16,289
Yes. I was in the bathroom.

00:06:24,397 --> 00:06:27,767
I waited for him to leave.
Then I called security.

00:06:27,834 --> 00:06:29,202
Do you see this man now?

00:06:30,637 --> 00:06:32,739
All you have to do is nod.

00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:40,680
Thanks.

00:06:43,783 --> 00:06:46,086
ID's off. We're looking
for a blue shirt and jeans.

00:06:46,152 --> 00:06:48,221
He could have
ditched the clothes.

00:06:48,288 --> 00:06:49,355
Let's be smart about this.

00:07:08,942 --> 00:07:10,877
Las Vegas Police.

00:07:10,944 --> 00:07:13,513
Put your hands behind your head
and stand up.

00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,782
Come on.

00:07:51,684 --> 00:07:55,188
You're not much of a talker,
are you, Walter?

00:08:00,827 --> 00:08:02,462
I'll tell you.

00:08:05,632 --> 00:08:08,134
You must be a pretty
tough guy to take on Tony.

00:08:08,201 --> 00:08:12,172
A guy as big as that?
He's huge.

00:08:12,238 --> 00:08:14,140
That's his name,
you know?

00:08:14,207 --> 00:08:16,142
Tony Sciarro
from Philadelphia.

00:08:16,209 --> 00:08:19,946
Did you know Tony?

00:08:20,013 --> 00:08:22,582
How come you left
his wallet

00:08:22,649 --> 00:08:26,152
and $500 in chips
in his pocket, huh?

00:08:26,219 --> 00:08:27,754
That makes me think

00:08:27,821 --> 00:08:30,690
that this was about
something else.

00:08:30,757 --> 00:08:32,525
Did he...

00:08:32,592 --> 00:08:35,829
wrong you
in some way?

00:08:35,895 --> 00:08:37,764
He hurt you?

00:08:37,831 --> 00:08:40,633
Huh?

00:08:45,271 --> 00:08:47,040
Maybe it was just a...

00:08:47,107 --> 00:08:49,375
lover's quarrel.

00:08:51,745 --> 00:08:53,813
I'm not soft.

00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:58,218
That's okay.
This is Vegas.

00:08:58,284 --> 00:09:02,822
But that's not what
we saw on the video.

00:09:02,889 --> 00:09:04,357
You're at the crap table.

00:09:04,424 --> 00:09:06,659
You swiped his chips.

00:09:06,726 --> 00:09:09,396
And then you whispered
sweet nothings in his ear.

00:09:11,097 --> 00:09:13,333
What did you say?

00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,468
Give me a reason.

00:09:15,535 --> 00:09:17,003
That a confession?

00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:18,872
No.

00:09:18,938 --> 00:09:20,974
That's what I said.

00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,476
That stare doesn't work on me.

00:09:23,543 --> 00:09:25,812
But save it.

00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:27,714
Because they're going
to love you in prison.

00:09:29,749 --> 00:09:32,752
Mr. Darien, may
I see your fingers?

00:09:32,819 --> 00:09:34,087
Why?

00:09:34,154 --> 00:09:37,357
Well, because you
may have evidence

00:09:37,424 --> 00:09:39,959
underneath the fingernails,
and I'd like to collect it.

00:09:58,344 --> 00:10:00,246
Mr. Darien,

00:10:00,313 --> 00:10:01,815
do you have a fever?

00:10:18,765 --> 00:10:22,135
( <i>yelling</i> )

00:10:27,507 --> 00:10:29,676
( <i>yelling</i> )

00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:13,469
You might want
to double-check that.

00:11:13,536 --> 00:11:15,705
I did.

00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,819
It's not as bad as it looks.

00:11:29,886 --> 00:11:32,555
It never looks too good
when a suspects dies in custody.

00:11:32,622 --> 00:11:34,524
What are you saying, Rory?

00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,726
You'd rather it be one of us?

00:11:36,792 --> 00:11:38,361
No, that's not
what I'm saying.

00:11:38,427 --> 00:11:41,731
If I was here, I'd have been in
there with you, you know that.

00:11:41,797 --> 00:11:45,234
I assume we're going to come out
looking like the bad guy again.

00:11:45,301 --> 00:11:48,237
Yeah.

00:11:50,072 --> 00:11:51,407
You okay?

00:11:51,474 --> 00:11:53,576
I'm fine.

00:11:55,178 --> 00:11:56,579
Nasty.

00:11:56,646 --> 00:11:58,514
That kind of looks
like a hickey.

00:12:00,249 --> 00:12:02,985
You want to tell me
what got this party started?

00:12:03,052 --> 00:12:05,221
I scraped his nails.

00:12:05,288 --> 00:12:07,323
That's it?

00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,658
What was his liver temp?

00:12:08,724 --> 00:12:10,760
101.5.

00:12:10,826 --> 00:12:12,495
He's been dead an hour.

00:12:12,562 --> 00:12:16,766
That means his body
temperature was 103.

00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:18,701
I touched his skin, Catherine.

00:12:18,768 --> 00:12:20,603
He felt like he was on fire.

00:12:32,448 --> 00:12:35,918
How did Walter Darien
even drive this thing?

00:12:35,985 --> 00:12:38,921
Where there's a will,
there's a way.

00:12:38,988 --> 00:12:42,258
PD found it
in the Orpheus parking lot.

00:12:44,961 --> 00:12:49,131
Blue shirt and jeans
right on top.

00:12:50,466 --> 00:12:52,468
He didn't even try to hide them.

00:13:04,914 --> 00:13:06,983
Positive for blood.

00:13:07,049 --> 00:13:08,718
I'll get it to Greg.

00:13:08,784 --> 00:13:12,054
So this scumbag, Walter Darien,

00:13:12,121 --> 00:13:15,858
he beats a guy to death, goes
out to his car, changes clothes

00:13:15,925 --> 00:13:18,928
and then goes back into the
casino, washes his hands

00:13:18,995 --> 00:13:20,496
and just gets something to eat.

00:13:20,563 --> 00:13:23,232
Just another day.

00:13:23,299 --> 00:13:24,734
Wow.

00:13:29,272 --> 00:13:30,339
Whoa...

00:13:30,406 --> 00:13:31,974
Yahtzee.

00:13:34,911 --> 00:13:36,145
Whoa.

00:13:36,212 --> 00:13:38,948
Must be a few thousand dollars'
worth of chips here.

00:13:40,983 --> 00:13:44,921
So, he grifts,
but doesn't cash in?

00:13:44,987 --> 00:13:47,190
Maybe it wasn't about the money.

00:13:48,724 --> 00:13:51,327
I got gloves,
a T-shirt and a jacket

00:13:51,394 --> 00:13:53,696
all with the tags
still on them.

00:13:53,763 --> 00:13:56,866
Maybe he just likes
to steal things.

00:14:07,343 --> 00:14:09,612
"Road Side Diner, Libby."

00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:11,380
Sara.

00:14:21,424 --> 00:14:23,993
What does that
look like to you?

00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:26,496
Burn holes.

00:14:26,562 --> 00:14:31,167
The guy takes on five
cops in their house.

00:14:31,234 --> 00:14:33,903
Makes you wonder
what he might have
done to a waitress.

00:14:40,343 --> 00:14:43,513
Didn't get enough of this guy
in the interrogation room?

00:14:43,579 --> 00:14:44,714
I have a question.

00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,215
Yes?

00:14:46,282 --> 00:14:47,750
Cause of death?

00:14:47,817 --> 00:14:50,253
Well, it wasn't
the nightstick action.

00:14:51,621 --> 00:14:53,656
Cardiac arrhythmia.

00:14:53,723 --> 00:14:56,692
His heart rate increased
till he went into tachycardia.

00:14:56,759 --> 00:14:58,694
Started throwing PVCs
and then V-fib.

00:14:58,761 --> 00:15:00,663
Prior condition?

00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:02,131
Nothing I could find.

00:15:02,198 --> 00:15:06,169
The guy had a big heart-- 550
grams-- but otherwise healthy.

00:15:06,235 --> 00:15:09,372
This guy was pumped up
before the fight.

00:15:09,438 --> 00:15:11,874
White knuckles, veins popping.

00:15:11,941 --> 00:15:14,043
Well, he could have been
on something-- tox is pending--

00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:17,914
but there were no observable
effects of long-term drug abuse.

00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:21,817
No atrophy, cirrhosis,
tissue necrosis.

00:15:21,884 --> 00:15:23,019
I checked all the hot spots.

00:15:23,085 --> 00:15:26,789
He had a temperature of 103
when he died.

00:15:26,856 --> 00:15:29,625
Any pathology to explain that?

00:15:29,692 --> 00:15:33,062
The organs showed no sign
of infection or disease.

00:15:33,129 --> 00:15:36,265
So there was nothing wrong
with this guy.

00:15:36,332 --> 00:15:39,101
Well, I'll send a tissue sample
to histology,

00:15:39,168 --> 00:15:41,437
but 98.6 is just an average.

00:15:41,504 --> 00:15:43,406
Some people run hot.

00:15:43,472 --> 00:15:47,143
See, during questioning,
your brother became a little...

00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:49,445
unruly, and, uh...

00:15:49,512 --> 00:15:50,780
so for their own safety,

00:15:50,847 --> 00:15:53,249
the officers had no choice
but to use force.

00:15:53,316 --> 00:15:55,651

00:15:55,718 --> 00:15:57,587

Ms. Darien,
it's very important

00:15:59,622 --> 00:16:01,924
that you understand
the situation here.

00:16:01,991 --> 00:16:03,426

00:16:03,492 --> 00:16:05,928

This is Beth Darien, the...

00:16:15,338 --> 00:16:18,941
I was in the room
with your brother.

00:16:19,008 --> 00:16:21,444
Was that how he touched
your life?

00:16:23,946 --> 00:16:27,650
The autopsy concluded
that your brother's death

00:16:27,717 --> 00:16:30,520
was not the result
of the officers' use of force.

00:16:30,586 --> 00:16:32,522
I don't care how he died.

00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:36,392
I'm just relieved
that it's over.

00:16:39,829 --> 00:16:42,765
Walter hurt a lot of people.

00:16:42,832 --> 00:16:44,367
If you had something
he wanted,

00:16:44,433 --> 00:16:45,801
he just took it.

00:16:45,868 --> 00:16:47,803
And if you got
in his way...

00:16:50,206 --> 00:16:51,874
I always kept my distance.

00:16:54,243 --> 00:16:58,181
Ms. Darien, your brother's body
temperature was...

00:16:58,247 --> 00:16:59,448
Hot to the touch?

00:16:59,515 --> 00:17:02,051
He was always that way,
ever since we were kids.

00:17:02,118 --> 00:17:03,653
I'll have someone

00:17:03,719 --> 00:17:06,189
from the department contact you,
all right, Ms. Darien?

00:17:06,255 --> 00:17:07,490
Always knew
that Walter

00:17:07,557 --> 00:17:09,425
would end up in jail or dead.

00:17:12,862 --> 00:17:14,063
I'm sorry.

00:17:31,447 --> 00:17:34,817
Griss, what are you
hoping to find here?

00:17:34,884 --> 00:17:36,752
Walter Darien lived here.

00:17:36,819 --> 00:17:38,054
He owned the place.

00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,522
Well, Greg ran
the DNA.

00:17:39,589 --> 00:17:42,758
The blood on
Walter's clothes
is a match to Tony.

00:17:42,825 --> 00:17:45,027
The hair in Tony's hands
is a match to Walter's.

00:17:45,094 --> 00:17:46,429
This case is closed,
isn't it?

00:17:46,496 --> 00:17:48,164
That case is closed.

00:17:48,231 --> 00:17:49,665
We can't prosecute
a dead man.

Well...

00:18:22,932 --> 00:18:27,036
if Walter viewed his world
as a threatening place,

00:18:27,103 --> 00:18:31,107
according to the shrinks,
the hoarding of useless objects

00:18:31,174 --> 00:18:33,976
may have made him feel
safe and secure.

00:18:34,043 --> 00:18:37,980
Yeah, well, in
the real world,
Walter's the threat.

00:18:41,217 --> 00:18:43,619

from inside the pelvis,
