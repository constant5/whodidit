00:00:07,659 --> 00:00:08,593
Come on. Come on.

00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:10,729
Let's go. Come on.
Don't fail me.

00:00:10,795 --> 00:00:12,397
Come on, baby.
I'm feeling this one.

00:00:12,464 --> 00:00:13,932
Don't fail me.
Don't you let me down.

00:00:13,999 --> 00:00:16,434
Alright.
Black 22.

00:00:16,501 --> 00:00:18,336
If this happens,
I'm buying you a shot.

00:00:18,403 --> 00:00:20,405
No more bets.

00:00:26,444 --> 00:00:28,446
Yes!
( <i>screams</i> )

00:00:34,085 --> 00:00:35,787
Yeah.

00:00:35,854 --> 00:00:37,656
WOMAN:
Give me my money.

00:00:40,425 --> 00:00:41,926
Let's cash out.

00:00:41,993 --> 00:00:43,428
Why? I, uh,
I thought we were going

00:00:43,495 --> 00:00:45,096
to take some risks tonight.
Come on...

00:00:45,163 --> 00:00:46,431
I want to go dancing.

00:00:46,498 --> 00:00:47,799
Really?
Mm-hmm.

00:00:47,866 --> 00:00:50,402
Okay. As long as
it's lap dancing.

00:00:50,468 --> 00:00:52,937
What has gotten
into you?

00:00:58,343 --> 00:00:59,444
Hey, buddy,
when you get a chance,

00:00:59,511 --> 00:01:00,912
can I get a couple more
of these martinis?

00:01:00,979 --> 00:01:02,547
One with an olive,
one with a twist.

00:01:02,614 --> 00:01:04,716
Thank you.

00:01:04,783 --> 00:01:07,719
Why don't we, um...

00:01:07,786 --> 00:01:08,920
take those
up to the room?

00:01:12,357 --> 00:01:13,425
'Cause I'm feeling a little...

00:01:13,491 --> 00:01:16,261
( <i>whispering</i> ):
frisky.

00:01:23,635 --> 00:01:25,637
Do you know them?

00:01:25,704 --> 00:01:27,839
( <i>chuckling</i> ):
No,

00:01:27,906 --> 00:01:30,842
but how frisky do you feel?

00:01:30,909 --> 00:01:33,545
Hmm?

00:01:37,182 --> 00:01:40,151
( <i>both chuckling</i> )

00:01:40,218 --> 00:01:42,787
I'll try anything once.

00:01:42,854 --> 00:01:44,022
Oh, really?

00:01:56,001 --> 00:01:58,870
( <i>dialogue inaudible</i> )

00:02:10,782 --> 00:02:12,717
Housekeeping coming in.

00:02:38,476 --> 00:02:39,778
( <i>screams</i> )

00:02:47,252 --> 00:02:50,255
( <i>indistinct</i>
<i>radio transmission</i> )

00:03:01,066 --> 00:03:02,934
GRISSOM:
Her throat's been slit

00:03:03,001 --> 00:03:04,703
by what appears
to have been

00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:06,271
a very sharp implement.

00:03:08,606 --> 00:03:11,042
The room is completely stripped.

00:03:11,109 --> 00:03:12,711
No bedding, no sheets.

00:03:12,777 --> 00:03:15,280
No towels, either.

00:03:15,347 --> 00:03:17,582
Someone took a few souvenirs.

00:03:17,649 --> 00:03:19,551
I'll check the
surveillance tapes.

00:03:30,061 --> 00:03:31,896
Alice Dominguez.

00:03:31,963 --> 00:03:34,265
She wasn't robbed.

00:03:34,332 --> 00:03:35,834
It's not her room, either.

00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,136
It was registered
under the name of Parker.

00:03:39,337 --> 00:03:40,572
Wedding ring.

00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:42,073
Where's the husband?

00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,743
( <i>faint, electronic whirring)</i>

00:03:46,611 --> 00:03:48,413
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,081
I think your cell phone's
vibrating.

00:03:50,148 --> 00:03:51,282
You heard that?

00:03:51,349 --> 00:03:52,217
Mm-hmm.

00:03:54,285 --> 00:03:57,022

There's only two reasons

in a casino.

00:04:41,561 --> 00:04:42,795
Sex or money.

00:04:42,862 --> 00:04:45,431
Well, on the money side,
the room was booked yesterday,

00:04:45,498 --> 00:04:48,067
under a stolen credit card
belonging to a Mrs. Parker.

00:04:48,134 --> 00:04:51,837
She's a 75-year-old
living alone in Henderson.

00:04:51,904 --> 00:04:54,974
As far as sex goes, well,
I want to be a believer.

00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:56,909
Room closest
to the exit.

00:04:56,976 --> 00:04:58,911
Imagine that.

00:04:58,978 --> 00:05:02,281
BROWN:
Quick escape.
Murder central.

00:05:02,348 --> 00:05:03,616
Security cameras?

00:05:03,683 --> 00:05:04,784
Uh, not in the hallway.

00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:06,285
Only in the elevator.
We're on it.

00:05:06,352 --> 00:05:08,120
Take the exit.

00:05:08,187 --> 00:05:09,455
I'll take the money trail.

00:05:11,157 --> 00:05:14,360
And I'll, uh...
go door-to-door.

00:05:18,364 --> 00:05:20,700
This is very weird.

00:05:22,368 --> 00:05:25,238
Yeah, usually when someone
gets their throat cut,

00:05:25,304 --> 00:05:26,539
it's from behind.

00:05:26,606 --> 00:05:28,274
Yeah, and it starts there,
ends there.

00:05:28,341 --> 00:05:29,642
It's not very deep.

00:05:32,545 --> 00:05:33,646
No ligature marks.

00:05:33,713 --> 00:05:35,114
No defensive wounds.

00:05:36,649 --> 00:05:39,318
I think whoever did this
was sitting in that chair.

00:05:47,526 --> 00:05:51,397
She sat there and allowed
someone to slit her throat?

00:05:53,566 --> 00:05:55,167
Hey, girl.

00:05:55,234 --> 00:05:57,003
Hi.

00:05:57,069 --> 00:05:58,170
What you got?

00:05:58,237 --> 00:05:59,505
Not much.

00:05:59,572 --> 00:06:01,607
Mrs. Dominguez checked in
with her husband yesterday.

00:06:01,674 --> 00:06:02,775
Room 869.

00:06:02,842 --> 00:06:04,610
869? That's, like,
two floors away

00:06:04,677 --> 00:06:06,279
from where she
was found dead.

00:06:06,345 --> 00:06:08,080
Anybody heard
from the husband yet?

00:06:08,147 --> 00:06:10,449
He's MIA, but he left
a gambling paper trail.

00:06:10,516 --> 00:06:11,450
Really?

00:06:11,517 --> 00:06:13,219
I have a signature
and a thumbprint

00:06:13,286 --> 00:06:14,820
from where Mr.
Dominguez signed

00:06:14,887 --> 00:06:16,289
a $5,000 cash-advance check.

00:06:16,355 --> 00:06:17,256
Cash advance, huh?

00:06:17,323 --> 00:06:19,292
It was cash advance
on a credit card.

00:06:19,358 --> 00:06:20,293
It's not cheap.

00:06:20,359 --> 00:06:21,961
It's, like $90
every thousand.

00:06:22,028 --> 00:06:22,962
That's a rip-off.

00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:23,863
Not if you're desperate.

00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:24,964
He must have
had a bad night.

00:06:25,031 --> 00:06:26,933
Yeah, and Mrs. Dominguez
had a worse night.

00:06:26,999 --> 00:06:28,901
You know, nobody's checked
their suite yet.

00:06:28,968 --> 00:06:30,136
Would you care to join me?

00:06:30,202 --> 00:06:31,203
Let's do it.

00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,139
I heard some voices raised
and a door slamming.

00:06:33,205 --> 00:06:34,140
Mm. How many voices?

00:06:34,206 --> 00:06:35,408
Two.

00:06:35,474 --> 00:06:38,177
No, wait.
Uh, maybe it was three.

00:06:38,244 --> 00:06:40,746
Definitely a man and a woman.

00:06:40,813 --> 00:06:41,781
What were they saying?

00:06:41,847 --> 00:06:42,915
Uh, it was hard to tell.

00:06:42,982 --> 00:06:45,351
You know, the walls in these
joints are pretty thick.

00:06:45,418 --> 00:06:47,420
They were definitely arguing
about something.

00:06:47,486 --> 00:06:48,354
Did you get a look at them?

00:06:48,421 --> 00:06:50,089
Uh, just through the spy hole.

00:06:50,156 --> 00:06:51,824
MAN:
Obviously he's insane.
They're both crazy.

00:06:51,891 --> 00:06:53,526
WOMAN:
Why would you put me
in that situation?

00:06:53,593 --> 00:06:54,994
I didn't put you
in that position with...

00:06:55,061 --> 00:06:56,062
What time was that?

00:06:56,128 --> 00:06:57,163
10:35.

00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,698
10:35?

00:06:58,764 --> 00:07:00,833
You seem to be
pretty sure about that.

00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,236
Well, I-I had just ordered
a pay-per-view movie,

00:07:03,302 --> 00:07:04,837
and it was just about to begin.

00:07:04,904 --> 00:07:06,105
Oh, yeah? Which
one was that?

00:07:06,172 --> 00:07:08,574
<i>Arma-get-it-on.</i>

00:07:08,641 --> 00:07:10,009
You mean, <i>Armageddon?</i>

00:07:10,076 --> 00:07:12,845
No. <i>Arma-get-it-on.</i>

00:07:12,912 --> 00:07:14,747
Oh.

00:07:16,749 --> 00:07:18,284
Good movie?

00:07:18,351 --> 00:07:20,119
Worked for me.

00:08:05,498 --> 00:08:06,432
Hey, guys.

00:08:06,499 --> 00:08:07,433
How you doing?

00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,802
Uh, I'm with the Las Vegas
Crime Lab, and I'm...

00:08:09,869 --> 00:08:10,436
Nick Stokes?

00:08:10,503 --> 00:08:11,904
Yeah.

00:08:11,971 --> 00:08:12,872
What's up?

00:08:13,973 --> 00:08:14,774
It's Kenny!

00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,776
Kenny Richmond.

00:08:16,842 --> 00:08:18,144
Rebel baseball.

00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:19,345
I played backup catcher.

00:08:19,412 --> 00:08:20,580
Kenny. Yeah!

00:08:20,646 --> 00:08:21,948
Hi, Kenny!
Yeah!

00:08:22,014 --> 00:08:22,949
How you doing, man?
How you doing?

00:08:23,015 --> 00:08:24,116
Good to see you.

00:08:24,183 --> 00:08:25,618
Good to see <i>you!</i>
Look at you, man.

00:08:25,685 --> 00:08:26,786
Yeah. Yeah.

00:08:26,852 --> 00:08:28,321
What are you
doing here?
You a cop now?

00:08:28,387 --> 00:08:29,989
Uh, Crime Scene Investigator.

00:08:30,056 --> 00:08:30,823
I'm on a case.

00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:34,293
Crime Scene?
Rock on, man.

00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,861
You're here on the
tenth floor thing, right?

00:08:35,928 --> 00:08:36,862
Right.

00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:39,165
Yeah. I heard
about that, man.

00:08:39,232 --> 00:08:41,467
Everybody's talking about it.

00:08:41,534 --> 00:08:42,668
Somebody, uh,

00:08:42,735 --> 00:08:44,870
bashed some chick's brains
in, I think, right?

00:08:44,937 --> 00:08:46,939
Yeah, actually, uh,
she had her throat slit

00:08:47,006 --> 00:08:48,441
and bled out
all over the room.

00:08:48,507 --> 00:08:51,477
I'll know more when I check
the surveillance camera.

00:08:51,544 --> 00:08:52,645
Well, what are you
doing down here?

00:08:52,712 --> 00:08:55,348
Uh, I'm just checking
possible escape routes.

00:08:55,414 --> 00:08:58,317
She was murdered in the room
closest to the exit.

00:08:58,384 --> 00:08:59,819
Murder central.

00:08:59,886 --> 00:09:02,555
Murder central, huh?

00:09:04,023 --> 00:09:05,524
Cool.

00:09:05,591 --> 00:09:08,060
ROBBINS:
Cut began at the right carotid.

00:09:08,127 --> 00:09:10,229
Severed the artery
and the jugular vein

00:09:10,296 --> 00:09:11,931
and terminated at the trachea.

00:09:11,998 --> 00:09:13,833
It's not as deep
as I would expect

00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,167
for this kind of crime.

00:09:15,234 --> 00:09:16,636
He sliced her gently?

00:09:16,702 --> 00:09:17,637
Well, yeah.

00:09:17,703 --> 00:09:18,905
Oftentimes,
the only thing intact

00:09:18,971 --> 00:09:19,906
is the spinal column.

00:09:19,972 --> 00:09:21,974
This did the job
and nothing more.

00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:23,910
And what did the tox report
give us?

00:09:23,976 --> 00:09:24,644
Alcohol count

00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:25,845
was .20.

00:09:25,912 --> 00:09:26,913
Double the legal limit.

00:09:26,979 --> 00:09:28,514
There was no limit
to this woman.

00:09:28,581 --> 00:09:30,983
Blood work showed
heavy traces of MDMA.

00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:33,519
Ecstasy? And alcohol?

00:09:33,586 --> 00:09:34,720
Party mix.

00:09:34,787 --> 00:09:37,924
Yeah, it might have made her
docile.

00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:40,259
Well, maybe it explains
why she was cut from the front.

00:09:40,326 --> 00:09:41,294
That may explain
her head.

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,030
Now let's move
down to the toes.

00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,041
Glitter?

00:09:55,107 --> 00:09:58,311
Yeah.

00:09:58,377 --> 00:10:01,314
There is a...
a strip club,

00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,282
um, named Shimmer

00:10:03,349 --> 00:10:05,284
on Industrial.

00:10:05,351 --> 00:10:09,455
I, uh, recognized the "S"
almost immediately.

00:10:10,223 --> 00:10:12,258
You go, Doc.

00:10:14,327 --> 00:10:15,261

Mr. Dominguez?

( <i>sighs</i> )

00:10:27,306 --> 00:10:30,042
Looks like the bed
wasn't slept in.

00:10:30,109 --> 00:10:31,844
Yeah.

00:10:44,257 --> 00:10:46,158
Stopped for gas in Barstow.

00:10:46,225 --> 00:10:47,293
Big tank. $43.

Clothes are still here.

00:10:48,961 --> 00:10:50,329

Two-Paul-Charlie-Edward-329.

00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:55,902
Really?

00:11:34,407 --> 00:11:35,341
Hey, Warrick.

00:11:35,408 --> 00:11:37,510
Take a look
at this wound.

00:11:37,577 --> 00:11:39,545
It's different than the wife's.

00:11:39,612 --> 00:11:41,180
She was cut from the front.

00:11:41,247 --> 00:11:44,450
Yeah, this one looks like
he was cut from the back.

00:11:44,517 --> 00:11:47,253
( <i>screaming</i> )

00:12:04,537 --> 00:12:06,272
Hey, guys?

00:12:06,339 --> 00:12:07,506
I got a knife.

00:12:19,585 --> 00:12:21,220
Use this, uh...

00:12:21,287 --> 00:12:24,357
cash-advance check
Warrick found as a reference.

00:12:24,423 --> 00:12:27,360
Hmm. Ink pads make
for great exemplars.

00:12:27,426 --> 00:12:29,328
And compare that
to the print I pulled off

00:12:29,395 --> 00:12:32,431
the exit door
and the knife... please.

00:12:32,498 --> 00:12:33,733
Here you go.

00:12:39,939 --> 00:12:41,407
Good characteristics here.

00:12:45,945 --> 00:12:48,047
Match to the door handle.

00:12:50,917 --> 00:12:53,185
And a match to the knife.

00:12:53,252 --> 00:12:54,453
One print on the knife.

00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,988
One print on the exit door.

00:12:56,055 --> 00:12:57,690
Both belonging to the husband.

00:12:57,757 --> 00:12:59,959
But we have two victims.

00:13:00,026 --> 00:13:01,193
GREG:
Speaking of twos...

00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:05,798
I found blood from both victims
on the knife.

00:13:05,865 --> 00:13:08,367
So it's possible
the husband killed the wife.

00:13:08,434 --> 00:13:11,270
Who killed the husband?

WOMAN:
Yeah,

00:13:31,192 --> 00:13:33,828
they look familiar--
from the neck up.

00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:35,406
I must've given them

00:13:35,473 --> 00:13:37,642
four, five
lap dances each.

00:13:37,709 --> 00:13:39,410
They made my night.

00:13:39,477 --> 00:13:40,678
So, they were George.

00:13:41,646 --> 00:13:42,714
Big tippers.

00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:43,548
No.

00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:45,350
They weren't the ones
paying for it.

00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:47,652
The other couple was.

00:13:47,719 --> 00:13:48,987
The other couple?

00:13:49,053 --> 00:13:51,523
Yeah, we were all
in the VIP booth over there.

00:13:57,362 --> 00:13:59,297
The four of them--
they came in together.

00:13:59,364 --> 00:14:00,999
The other couple
just wanted to watch.

00:14:01,065 --> 00:14:03,034
So I assumed
they were friends.

00:14:03,101 --> 00:14:04,202
Good friends.

00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,212
I didn't get a good look
at the other two,

00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:16,448
but they slid that money
across the table...

00:14:16,514 --> 00:14:18,216
mmm, brick this big.

00:14:18,283 --> 00:14:20,251
So, like I said,

00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:22,253
they just wanted
to doggie in the window.

00:14:23,521 --> 00:14:25,056
Watch.

00:14:25,123 --> 00:14:27,258
And they were subbing drinks
left and right.

00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,762
Ordering clear drinks
to keep the party going.

00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:31,930
What'd they order?

00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:34,432
Two vodkas, two soda waters.

00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:36,101

Would you like a dance?

00:14:53,651 --> 00:14:54,819
Uh, I got to be
at the courthouse.

00:14:54,886 --> 00:14:56,821
Apparently, there's a last-
minute evidentiary hearing

00:14:56,888 --> 00:14:57,822
in the Sam Braun case.

00:14:57,889 --> 00:14:58,757
I need to be there.

00:14:58,823 --> 00:15:00,692
You sure
you don't want a dance?

00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:02,594
I could be your specimen.

00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,763
You could be my mad scientist.

have of the Dominguezes alive.

Who were they with?

Don't know,
but check it out.

Brass's witness said he heard
a couple arguing at 10:35.

00:15:23,948 --> 00:15:25,784
This must be them, going down.

00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:26,885
But coming up...

00:15:29,654 --> 00:15:31,523
They're with the same
mystery couple

00:15:31,589 --> 00:15:33,224
who brought up
the Dominguezes.

00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:35,760
Can you make me a still
of the 10:35 couple,

00:15:35,827 --> 00:15:37,996
the ones that went
up and down?

00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,497
Freeze it there.

I played baseball in college
with this guy.

00:16:26,811 --> 00:16:28,613
I bumped into him
for, like, two seconds.

00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,415
Don't tell me you opened
your mouth to the guy.

my mouth to the press, okay?

at this time.

How much do you
love your wife?

Sobered me right up.

00:18:29,868 --> 00:18:31,436
I mean, he didn't
just ask it once.

00:18:31,503 --> 00:18:34,439
He asked it... over and
over again, and then

00:18:34,506 --> 00:18:37,809
Mandy asked how far
we'd go to prove it.

up there in the first place.

Sam told me it takes a lifetime
to establish a reputation

00:19:53,118 --> 00:19:54,919

When I suspected that Sam

00:20:00,225 --> 00:20:02,627
was my father,
I didn't go to him.

and had him run a DNA test.

On who?

She's not

Where's her husband?

00:22:11,923 --> 00:22:13,958
( <i>shouts</i> )
Oh, geez.

BRASS:
What was all
that about?

00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:27,505
False alarm.

00:22:27,572 --> 00:22:28,840
Apparently, the guy

00:22:28,907 --> 00:22:29,941
just drove in
from Fresno.

00:22:30,008 --> 00:22:31,509
Fell asleep
in his car,

00:22:31,576 --> 00:22:32,877
and didn't even
check in yet.

00:22:38,249 --> 00:22:39,584
Jesus!

00:22:39,651 --> 00:22:40,385
Help!

00:22:40,452 --> 00:22:42,353
Jesus!
Whoa. Hey. Hey, buddy.

00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,888
Geez.
Take it easy.
Take it easy.

00:23:04,175 --> 00:23:06,177
This one's different.

00:23:07,178 --> 00:23:09,447
Something's not right.

00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,308
Okay, be careful, David.

00:23:21,374 --> 00:23:23,276
The body's frozen, and
it's in full rigor.

00:23:23,343 --> 00:23:24,578
You're going to
have to tilt it.

00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:27,213
Tilt it, sir?

00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,748
Yeah.

00:23:28,815 --> 00:23:30,350
Downward
90-degree angle,

00:23:30,417 --> 00:23:32,652
then up, tilt,

00:23:32,719 --> 00:23:33,420
and out.

00:23:33,486 --> 00:23:35,121
Okay. Uh...

00:23:35,188 --> 00:23:36,289
All right, man.

00:23:36,356 --> 00:23:37,657
Um...

00:23:37,724 --> 00:23:39,526
I'll take the shoulders,
you take the feet.

00:23:39,593 --> 00:23:40,894
Okay.
Okay?

00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:42,062
You ready?

00:23:42,128 --> 00:23:43,229
On three.

00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:45,031
One, two, three, up.

00:23:45,098 --> 00:23:46,266
And now tilt.

00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:47,867
Come on. Up.

00:23:47,934 --> 00:23:49,069
Okay, now tilt.

00:23:49,135 --> 00:23:50,303
Oh, God.

00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:52,472
Up more, tilt more. Now.

00:23:52,539 --> 00:23:53,640
Uh, God.

00:23:53,707 --> 00:23:54,874
Oh, down, down,
put him down.

00:23:54,941 --> 00:23:56,509
One more time.
Ready, one time. One...

00:23:56,576 --> 00:23:58,979
two, three, up.

00:23:59,045 --> 00:24:00,413
Oh, God.

00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,648
S-Sir, we can't get him.

00:24:01,715 --> 00:24:02,849
Uh, his knee's bent.

00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:05,085
Put him back
down carefully.

00:24:08,221 --> 00:24:10,223

There.

00:24:25,205 --> 00:24:26,539
Now try.

00:24:26,606 --> 00:24:28,541

00:24:30,911 --> 00:24:32,812
Do we have to do the
inventory on all this?

00:24:32,879 --> 00:24:35,315
Yeah. What, 15 buckets?

00:24:35,382 --> 00:24:37,050
This is our first bucket
brigade together, gentlemen.

00:24:37,117 --> 00:24:39,185
Try and say that
ten times fast.

00:24:39,252 --> 00:24:41,187
Bucket brigade.
Bucket brigade.
Bucket brigade.

00:24:41,254 --> 00:24:42,355
We have to do this quickly.

00:24:42,422 --> 00:24:44,758
It's 120 degrees outside,
and our crime scene is melting.

00:25:25,131 --> 00:25:27,901
Hold on a second.

00:25:31,504 --> 00:25:33,206
I got something.

00:25:38,979 --> 00:25:40,247
Whoa.

00:25:40,313 --> 00:25:41,715
GRISSOM:
Would you like
to bag this

00:25:41,781 --> 00:25:43,383
for me, Warrick?
My hands are little numb.

00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:57,697
Sara?

00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:58,765
Yeah.

00:25:58,832 --> 00:25:59,966
Would you take
a sample of

00:26:00,033 --> 00:26:01,134
this blood for me?

00:26:01,201 --> 00:26:01,901
Sure.

00:26:01,968 --> 00:26:03,937
Warrick, help her

00:26:04,004 --> 00:26:05,438
process this.

00:26:05,505 --> 00:26:06,640
Nick?

00:26:06,706 --> 00:26:08,074
Yeah.

00:26:08,141 --> 00:26:09,409
Come with me.

00:26:30,363 --> 00:26:32,432
Shut the door, Nick.

00:26:32,499 --> 00:26:35,201
You want to talk?

00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:37,904
No.

00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:40,273
I want to see the room
the way they left it.

00:26:48,415 --> 00:26:50,350
You know, if it's anything
like the Sphere,

00:26:50,417 --> 00:26:53,353
we're probably not going
to find much.

00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,422
We're still
going to look.

00:27:47,407 --> 00:27:49,943
Bathroom's clean.

00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:53,313
Haven't you ever
seen one of those

00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,014
before?

00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,083
Not in person, no.

00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:58,785
Magic Fingers.

00:27:58,852 --> 00:28:01,054
25 cents for 15 minutes
of vibration.

00:28:01,121 --> 00:28:02,522
Died a slow death in the '70s

00:28:02,589 --> 00:28:04,724
due to vandalism

00:28:04,791 --> 00:28:06,293
and seedy connotations.

00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:07,460
Good for sex.

00:28:07,527 --> 00:28:09,329
Good for sleep... too.

00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:10,630
Good for us.

00:28:10,697 --> 00:28:12,732
Given the killer's

00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:16,536
appetite for sexual persuasion,
maybe they blew the circuit.

00:28:16,603 --> 00:28:18,171
Overloaded it with coins.

00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:20,473
And their prints
on those coins.

00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,211

Is that it? We're done?

00:28:51,471 --> 00:28:53,106
I think so.

00:28:53,173 --> 00:28:55,609
Well, power's back on.

00:28:58,979 --> 00:29:01,047
So, why this place?

00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:04,484
How do you go
from the Sphere to the Fez?

00:29:06,553 --> 00:29:09,356
What do you think, Nick?

00:29:11,191 --> 00:29:13,226
A reporter got some inside

00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:14,394
information.

00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:16,229
Killer probably heard
about himself

00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:18,798
on the news,
changed his MO.

00:29:18,865 --> 00:29:20,433
Oh, great.

00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,635
Help the bad guys.

00:29:21,701 --> 00:29:24,271
I'm sure the Laggermans
appreciate that.

00:29:25,338 --> 00:29:27,274
I should probably
get those quarters

00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:29,376
back to the lab,
work on the prints.

00:29:44,624 --> 00:29:47,861
( <i>vibrating</i> )

00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:53,133
I need 15 minutes to think.

00:29:58,538 --> 00:30:00,574
Enjoy.

00:30:29,736 --> 00:30:30,337
Hey.

00:30:30,403 --> 00:30:31,504
Hey.
Your spot of blood

on the ice
machine lid?

00:30:32,906 --> 00:30:34,174
Yeah?
We've got
three alleles

00:30:34,241 --> 00:30:35,075
on several loci.

00:30:35,141 --> 00:30:36,910
Is it a mixture of more
than one stain?

00:30:36,977 --> 00:30:38,345
One blood came
back the vic's.

00:30:38,411 --> 00:30:39,879
The other came back unknown.

00:30:39,946 --> 00:30:41,548
Oh.

00:30:43,917 --> 00:30:46,186
Chances are that's our killer.

their victims with
the promise of sex.

00:30:56,096 --> 00:30:58,064
And then they get
them to the room.

00:30:59,532 --> 00:31:00,634
And they say,

00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,035
"Just kidding.
We don't want sex.

00:31:02,102 --> 00:31:03,570

Which still
doesn't explain

00:31:12,846 --> 00:31:15,815
how they get
the husband to
kill his wife.

00:31:15,882 --> 00:31:18,418
They had to have been
in some kind of situation

00:31:18,485 --> 00:31:20,420
where they couldn't say no.

00:31:20,487 --> 00:31:22,689

or you both die.

They didn't think
he was just going to walk away.

00:31:34,968 --> 00:31:36,903
Maybe he was hoping
to save his wife

Why did he stick him
in the ice machine?

Well, I checked
with the manager.

No car.

So he had to improvise.

Where's your car?

an odd mixture of blood,

00:32:27,787 --> 00:32:31,858
it's safe to say
that someone cut themselves.

Brass showed them
to the motel manager.

How much do you love your wife?

00:34:50,096 --> 00:34:52,065
"Love is not love."

00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:54,267
Shakespeare?

00:34:54,334 --> 00:34:58,738
"Let me not the marriage
of true minds..."

00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:00,040
"...admit impediments

00:35:00,106 --> 00:35:01,341
Love is not love..."

00:35:01,408 --> 00:35:04,644
"...but bears it out
till the edge of doom."

00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:07,681
One of the sonnets.

00:35:07,747 --> 00:35:09,950
Love is conditional.

00:35:10,984 --> 00:35:12,285
For most people.

00:35:13,853 --> 00:35:15,422
But not for you.

00:35:25,127 --> 00:35:26,462
Okay, here we go.

00:35:26,528 --> 00:35:30,165
We've got a husband-and-wife
serial team killing couples.

00:35:30,232 --> 00:35:31,467
So, let's see where we're at

00:35:31,534 --> 00:35:33,135
starting
with the first double murder.

00:35:33,202 --> 00:35:34,303
Sara?

00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:36,472
Bloody knife linking back
to Alice Dominguez.

00:35:36,539 --> 00:35:38,807
WILLOWS:
We suspect
that Mr. Dominguez

00:35:38,874 --> 00:35:40,843
was forced to kill his wife

00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:42,778
for the promise
of freedom.

00:35:42,845 --> 00:35:44,413
MANDY:
Come on. Do it.

00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,549
Just cut her throat,

00:35:46,615 --> 00:35:48,284
and you can walk
out of here.

00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:50,286
STOKES:
That explains
the thumbprint

00:35:50,352 --> 00:35:52,655
I found on the exit door
leading to the garage.

00:35:52,721 --> 00:35:54,256
What, they take him for a walk?

00:35:54,323 --> 00:35:56,158
They were never going
to let him go.

00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:07,203
Doc Robbins
found evidence

00:36:07,269 --> 00:36:08,971
of glitter
on Mrs. Dominguez.

00:36:09,038 --> 00:36:10,706
I also found glitter
on Mr. Dominguez.

00:36:10,773 --> 00:36:13,108
I found some
on Mr. Klinefeld's shoes,

00:36:13,175 --> 00:36:14,643
so it's possible
the Klinefelds

00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:16,245
picked up
their first couple

00:36:16,312 --> 00:36:17,246
at Shimmer.

00:36:17,313 --> 00:36:19,381
Did anyone at Shimmer
ID the Klinefelds?

00:36:19,448 --> 00:36:21,483
I didn't get a good look
at the other two.

00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:23,719
We didn't know who they were
at the time.

00:36:23,786 --> 00:36:25,554
Okay...

00:36:25,621 --> 00:36:27,389
that's it for the first murder.

00:36:27,456 --> 00:36:28,724
What about the second?

00:36:28,791 --> 00:36:31,293
Uh, we've got prints
on quarters.

00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,796
We do have
an admixture of blood
off the ice machine.

00:36:33,862 --> 00:36:35,631
What about prints
on the ice machine knife?

00:36:35,698 --> 00:36:37,099
BROWN:
Forget it.

00:36:37,166 --> 00:36:38,434
Ice destroyed it.

00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,803
WILLOWS:
Okay, so, uh,
we're going to have

00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:42,304
to get into
the Klinefelds' house.

00:36:42,371 --> 00:36:44,440
If they haven't tossed
the towels and sheets...

00:36:44,506 --> 00:36:47,576
we may have something.

00:36:47,643 --> 00:36:50,779
BRASS:
No. Uh, look,
there's got to be some mistake.

00:36:50,846 --> 00:36:53,849
We are this close to busting
a pair of serial killers

00:36:53,916 --> 00:36:55,918
and the judge won't issue
a warrant?

00:36:55,985 --> 00:36:57,353
Hey, I'm just the messenger.

00:36:57,419 --> 00:36:58,821
BRASS:
Give me the affidavit.

00:36:58,888 --> 00:37:00,489
CLERK:
He won't sign it.

00:37:00,556 --> 00:37:02,258
It's not the first time.

00:37:02,324 --> 00:37:03,259
Sorry.

00:37:03,325 --> 00:37:04,760
MAN:
<i>Look, I have signed hundreds</i>

00:37:04,827 --> 00:37:07,963
of search warrants
for Captain Brass, but...

00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:10,466
this affidavit
lacks probable cause.

00:37:10,533 --> 00:37:13,369
Prints on quarters,
an admixture of DNA...

00:37:13,435 --> 00:37:15,371
DNA, if given a warrant,
will clear or convict...

00:37:15,437 --> 00:37:16,605
...are not enough for me

00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:19,441
Your Honor,
to invade the Klinefelds'
right to privacy.

00:37:19,508 --> 00:37:21,277
with all due respect, you've
signed warrants for less.

00:37:21,343 --> 00:37:23,379
Yes... and where did it get me?

00:37:23,445 --> 00:37:25,347
Just last week,
the Appeals Court overturned

00:37:25,414 --> 00:37:27,216
one of our convictions,
based on a search warrant

00:37:27,283 --> 00:37:28,484
I gave to one of your sidekicks.

00:37:28,551 --> 00:37:30,286
We make a habit of this,

00:37:30,352 --> 00:37:32,454
I'm never going to get
to the Foley Building.

00:37:32,521 --> 00:37:33,956
Federal appointment.

00:37:34,023 --> 00:37:35,024
What if they kill again?

00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:36,859
All the more reason
we need to get this right.

00:37:36,926 --> 00:37:38,460
Unappealable.

00:37:38,527 --> 00:37:39,929
The affidavit is thin.

00:37:39,995 --> 00:37:43,532
You give me more...
I'll give you more.

00:37:53,609 --> 00:37:56,045
Funny, doesn't look
like a doghouse.

00:37:57,079 --> 00:37:59,148
Grissom
ratted me out, huh?

00:37:59,215 --> 00:38:02,184
Um, no, you ratted
yourself out.

00:38:02,251 --> 00:38:06,922
Hey, Nick, I know you're
proud of what you do.

00:38:06,989 --> 00:38:07,957
You're good at what you do,

00:38:08,023 --> 00:38:09,491
and you want people
to know what you do,

00:38:09,558 --> 00:38:11,160
but once you open your
mouth, it's all over

00:38:11,227 --> 00:38:14,129
'cause what we say
ends up in the news.

00:38:14,196 --> 00:38:15,998
I guess I'm learning that
the hard way, huh?

00:38:20,436 --> 00:38:23,372
All right, ( <i>clears throat),</i>
let's take a look.

00:38:27,877 --> 00:38:30,212
You see, it looks
like something

00:38:30,279 --> 00:38:34,183
got a little bit
more interesting
than roulette here.

00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:35,985
So, if that's the lure,

00:38:36,051 --> 00:38:38,587
where's the catch?

00:38:38,654 --> 00:38:39,922
( <i>taps keyboard</i> )

00:38:39,989 --> 00:38:43,259
Mm-hmm.

00:38:43,325 --> 00:38:45,060
Clear drinks.

00:38:45,127 --> 00:38:48,163
What do you want to bet the
Rifkins are drinking vodka

00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:49,899
and the Klinefelds club soda.

00:38:49,965 --> 00:38:52,067
Hmm.

00:38:55,671 --> 00:38:56,872
Did you see that?

00:38:56,939 --> 00:38:59,441
That was a little tongue
action right there.

00:38:59,508 --> 00:39:00,910
So, if we're
creatures of habit...

00:39:00,976 --> 00:39:02,878
If she stuck her tongue
in Mr. Rifkin's ear,

00:39:02,945 --> 00:39:05,614
chances are she stuck it
in Mr. Dominguez's ear, too.

00:39:05,681 --> 00:39:07,316
Mr. Dominguez
has already been autopsied.

00:39:07,383 --> 00:39:08,384
Washed from head-to-toe.

00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:09,685
What about the ice man?

00:39:09,752 --> 00:39:11,220
( <i>softly</i> ):
Coroners.

00:39:16,292 --> 00:39:18,494
He's not picking up.

00:39:22,498 --> 00:39:24,233
Oh, hey, Doc. Doc.

00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,401
Where's the ice man?

00:39:25,467 --> 00:39:27,002
Uh, David's
cleaning him up.

00:39:28,037 --> 00:39:29,071
David...

00:39:29,138 --> 00:39:29,872
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

00:39:29,939 --> 00:39:30,439
Drop the hose.

00:39:30,506 --> 00:39:31,974
What did I do?

00:39:32,041 --> 00:39:33,809
Did you go from head
to toe or head to toe?

00:39:33,876 --> 00:39:35,110
Toe to head.

00:39:35,177 --> 00:39:36,245
Good.

00:39:36,312 --> 00:39:38,080
Good answer.

00:39:51,794 --> 00:39:52,828
You run with it.

00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:09,845
We get it yet?

00:40:09,912 --> 00:40:11,447
Any minute now.

00:40:12,481 --> 00:40:16,218
SANDERS:
Here it is.

00:40:19,021 --> 00:40:21,223
Affirmative
for female DNA.

00:40:23,926 --> 00:40:26,795
Where are the admixture results
from the ice machine?

00:40:26,862 --> 00:40:28,864
Right here.

00:40:36,272 --> 00:40:37,506
This is the same woman.

00:40:37,573 --> 00:40:41,143
Whoever was in his ear
was on that ice machine.

00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:42,945
STOKES:
She's the killer.

00:40:43,012 --> 00:40:44,413
Please, let me go.

00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,981
Please, let me go.
You guys...

00:40:46,048 --> 00:40:47,049
( <i>thuds</i> )

00:40:58,494 --> 00:41:02,064
This should get us a warrant.

00:41:20,716 --> 00:41:24,186
Okay, split up.
Go around the back.

00:41:27,189 --> 00:41:28,824
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:41:32,528 --> 00:41:34,363
( <i>doorbell ringing</i> )

00:41:39,101 --> 00:41:40,803
( <i>TV playing in background</i> )

00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:43,973
Las Vegas Police.
Mr and Mrs Klinefeld...

00:41:44,039 --> 00:41:47,042
We have a warrant.

00:42:18,841 --> 00:42:20,242
We got a problem...

00:42:25,014 --> 00:42:27,656
Somebody got to our killers
before we did.
