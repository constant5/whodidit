00:00:06,917 --> 00:00:09,920
MAN:
Thank you.
Have a good night.

00:00:09,987 --> 00:00:12,055
Eagles covered, bruh.

00:00:12,122 --> 00:00:13,256
Cough up the 20.

00:00:13,323 --> 00:00:14,257
Man, backdoor touchdown.

00:00:14,324 --> 00:00:15,425
Man, kills you every time.

00:00:15,492 --> 00:00:17,695
Ha-ha!

00:00:17,695 --> 00:00:19,593
Alright no more martini's for you. 

00:00:28,508 --> 00:00:29,910
Welcome to the Orpheus.

00:00:29,976 --> 00:00:31,511
You checking in
or just donating?

00:00:31,578 --> 00:00:33,313
Checking in.
Any bags, sir?

00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,016
I got this one.
Grab the one in the trunk.

00:00:40,387 --> 00:00:41,721

Car bomb.

00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:11,351
Driver and valet are dead.

00:01:11,418 --> 00:01:13,887
Another valet
is critical.

00:01:13,954 --> 00:01:15,155
Got at least a dozen injured.

00:01:15,222 --> 00:01:16,323
I was having dinner here.

00:01:16,389 --> 00:01:17,824
Was on my way out.

00:01:17,891 --> 00:01:19,259
It'd gone off
a couple of seconds later,

00:01:19,326 --> 00:01:20,894
you'd be picking my badge up
off the ground.

00:01:20,961 --> 00:01:22,329
Thank God you're all right.

00:01:22,395 --> 00:01:24,931

The gunpowder
must have

I believe the, uh,

traveled from the

00:02:49,525 --> 00:02:52,495
David, we have body
parts in the car.

00:02:52,562 --> 00:02:54,197
I've been looking
for the feet.

00:02:54,263 --> 00:02:55,598
I found 'em.

00:02:55,665 --> 00:02:57,667
We gotta ID the driver ASAP.

00:03:02,038 --> 00:03:04,173
Well, the VIN number's
still attached.

00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,474

00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:06,809
Call in the DMV.

00:03:06,876 --> 00:03:08,911
Yes, sir.

00:03:35,705 --> 00:03:37,807
Sorry, Catherine.

00:03:37,874 --> 00:03:40,510
Traffic's backed up all
the way to the Strip.

00:03:40,576 --> 00:03:42,645
Got a SIG-Sauer.

00:03:42,712 --> 00:03:44,113
Probably the driver's.

00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,648
I'll start bagging.

00:03:45,715 --> 00:03:48,584
Gather the detritus and separate
out the bomb components.

00:03:48,651 --> 00:03:51,754
Okay.

Wish I could help, but, uh,
I got a vehicle to process.

00:04:02,298 --> 00:04:04,200
Come on, Grissom--
a bomb goes off these days,

00:04:04,267 --> 00:04:05,735
they're going to assume
it's a hit.

00:04:05,801 --> 00:04:07,570
What are you thinking?

00:04:07,637 --> 00:04:09,572
I'm not thinking.
I'm just looking.

00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:11,240
That's good.

00:04:11,307 --> 00:04:13,643

00:04:20,683 --> 00:04:24,654

It was a pipe bomb.

00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,999
Initiated by a
lightbulb filament.

00:10:10,066 --> 00:10:11,901
Bomb was attached
to the fuel tank.

00:10:11,968 --> 00:10:14,337
There were still magnet
and solder fragments

00:10:14,403 --> 00:10:16,239
attached to the pipe.

and I need to know why.

00:10:45,368 --> 00:10:47,503
Well, the evidence is only
teaching us about the bomb,

00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:48,504
not the bomber.

00:10:48,571 --> 00:10:49,605

particular bomb?

00:10:52,775 --> 00:10:55,811
No.

00:11:19,669 --> 00:11:21,938
She was only 25.

00:11:22,004 --> 00:11:23,806
Was there some kind of defect?

00:11:23,873 --> 00:11:25,675
No, her heart was
in perfect condition.

00:11:25,741 --> 00:11:27,176
In fact, I have it over here.

00:11:29,212 --> 00:11:31,647
See the myocardium?

00:11:31,714 --> 00:11:33,616

infarct or scarring.

00:11:34,884 --> 00:11:36,252
No coronary occlusions.

00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,920
I can't explain it.

00:11:37,987 --> 00:11:39,922
It's like a mystery
of the heart.

00:11:42,658 --> 00:11:46,062
DAWSON:
So, that SIG-Sauer
you found...

00:11:46,128 --> 00:11:48,064
Yes.
Relatively nondescript.

00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:50,266
Uh, the blue stuff,
sent a sample to Trace.

00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,235
Pretty sure
it's from some sort of bag

00:11:52,301 --> 00:11:53,803
that melted in the explosion.

00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:56,138
Right. And the bullets
from the Camaro's trunk?

00:11:56,205 --> 00:11:57,473
A-ha.

00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,841
Pre-fragmented ammo.

00:11:58,908 --> 00:12:00,142
Now they're unique.

00:12:00,209 --> 00:12:02,445
Exemplar's
under the magnifier.

00:12:02,512 --> 00:12:05,181
Copper jacket
contains lead shot

00:12:05,248 --> 00:12:06,916
sealed with a clear
epoxy plug.

00:12:06,983 --> 00:12:08,851
I've never seen anything
like that.

00:12:08,918 --> 00:12:10,653
It's designed
to enter a target,

00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,021
but not exit.

00:12:12,088 --> 00:12:13,523
( <i>gunshot</i> )

00:12:13,589 --> 00:12:15,625
( <i>bullet impacts</i> )

00:12:15,691 --> 00:12:17,927
Penetration, not perforation.

00:12:17,994 --> 00:12:19,562
Why?

00:12:19,629 --> 00:12:21,931
Well, say you're
on a commercial flight.

00:12:21,998 --> 00:12:23,166
Plane gets hijacked.

00:12:23,232 --> 00:12:24,534
US Air Marshal needs

00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,102
to take down the hijacker...

00:12:26,169 --> 00:12:27,303
But not the plane.

00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:29,672
Nowadays, MagSafes
are sold commercially,

00:12:29,739 --> 00:12:31,941
but there's really
not much of a market.

00:12:32,008 --> 00:12:35,011
So chances are, your driver's
a Federal Air Marshal.

00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:38,447
( <i>computer bleeps</i> )

00:12:38,514 --> 00:12:40,049
It's a match.

00:12:40,116 --> 00:12:43,986
Print on the hot tub dial
was Sam Hopkins.

00:12:44,053 --> 00:12:45,288
Rueben's manager?

00:12:45,354 --> 00:12:47,123
Amelia was butt-naked
in the hot tub.

00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:49,425
What was he doing in her room
tweaking dials?

00:12:49,492 --> 00:12:50,860
While her husband's onstage?

00:12:51,994 --> 00:12:53,796
Spectroscopy just got back.

00:12:53,863 --> 00:12:56,032
Hydrofluoric acid in her system.

00:12:56,098 --> 00:12:57,800
Isn't that
an industrial solvent?

00:12:57,867 --> 00:12:59,068
High-powered stuff.

00:12:59,135 --> 00:13:02,071
Mainly used to remove rust,
clean glass, brighten aluminum,

00:13:02,138 --> 00:13:05,208
dissolve silicas...
and commit murder.

00:13:05,274 --> 00:13:06,442
She was poisoned.

00:13:06,509 --> 00:13:09,078
That would explain
her heart attack.

00:13:09,145 --> 00:13:10,746
You're killing me, Jimmy.

00:13:10,813 --> 00:13:12,515
You're killing me.

00:13:12,582 --> 00:13:13,749
All night the spotlight was off.

00:13:13,816 --> 00:13:14,750
Way too hot on his face.

00:13:14,817 --> 00:13:15,952
It's too hot on me right now.

00:13:16,018 --> 00:13:17,854
They guy's not Wayne Newton,
all right?

00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,722
Can you see it
on my face, Jim?

00:13:19,789 --> 00:13:20,723
I need... Jimmy.

00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:23,059
Thank...
I need a cast shadow on him

00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:24,260
for all the love songs.

00:13:24,327 --> 00:13:26,929
Mr. Hopkins, could you answer
the question, please.

00:13:26,996 --> 00:13:28,097
Sorry.

00:13:28,164 --> 00:13:29,365
Yes, I was in Amelia's room.

00:13:29,432 --> 00:13:30,600
I'm in there all the time.

00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:31,601
We're like family.

00:13:31,667 --> 00:13:32,768
We know you were close.

00:13:32,835 --> 00:13:35,071
Do you always turn on
the hot tub for her?

00:13:35,137 --> 00:13:38,074
I represent one of the biggest
headliners in town.

00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,308
Wear a lot of hats:

00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:42,044
Manager, marriage
counselor, confidante.

00:13:42,111 --> 00:13:44,714
I kept Myles happy
by keeping her happy.

00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:47,049
HOPKINS:
Amelia,

00:13:47,116 --> 00:13:48,284
anything else I can get for you?

00:13:49,352 --> 00:13:51,220
Look, sweetheart.

00:13:51,287 --> 00:13:53,456
Here's how this works.

00:13:53,523 --> 00:13:57,160
You give him his space,
he sings his heart out.

00:13:57,226 --> 00:13:59,862
Honey, we all prosper.

00:13:59,929 --> 00:14:02,131
Let me set up a dinner
for you two--

00:14:02,198 --> 00:14:04,167
quiet, alone-- after the show.

00:14:04,233 --> 00:14:05,401
No work.

00:14:05,468 --> 00:14:07,436
Never happen.

00:14:07,503 --> 00:14:09,372
Relax.

00:14:09,438 --> 00:14:10,973
Give me an hour.

00:14:14,644 --> 00:14:16,746
But you must admit,
the boss' wife,

00:14:16,812 --> 00:14:19,282
naked in a hot tub,
looks kind of funky.

00:14:19,348 --> 00:14:20,416
Look at me.

00:14:20,483 --> 00:14:22,051
Do I look like a threat?

00:14:22,118 --> 00:14:23,719
The reason I've succeeded
in this business,

00:14:23,786 --> 00:14:25,755
I don't squat where I eat,
you know what I mean?

00:14:25,822 --> 00:14:27,156
All right,
let's talk about drinking.

00:14:27,223 --> 00:14:28,891
There was a bottle of wine
found near the tub.

00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:30,092
Did you have a drink with her?

00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:31,194
No. Never.

00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,595
I don't touch it.

00:14:32,662 --> 00:14:33,930
I'm on call 24/7.

00:14:33,996 --> 00:14:36,465
Myles can pick up the phone,
have me do anything, anytime.

00:14:36,532 --> 00:14:38,401
Fly to L.A.,
pick someone up at the airport.

00:14:38,467 --> 00:14:40,336
So, you'd do just about anything
for him then?

00:14:40,403 --> 00:14:41,871
When it comes to Myles, yeah.

00:14:41,938 --> 00:14:43,072
What's this all about?

00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:45,374
Mr. Hopkins,
Amelia didn't drown.

00:14:45,441 --> 00:14:46,642
She was poisoned.

00:14:46,709 --> 00:14:48,177
Poisoned? By who?

00:14:48,244 --> 00:14:50,346
That's what we're trying
to find out.

00:14:50,413 --> 00:14:51,814
BRASS:
According to the DMV,

00:14:51,881 --> 00:14:54,150
the Camaro was one of yours,
is that right?

00:14:54,217 --> 00:14:56,786
Yeah, it was rented
to an Adam Watson.

00:14:56,853 --> 00:14:57,954
Waived insurance.

00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,722
Government discount.

00:14:59,789 --> 00:15:01,357
Well, we have reason
to believe

00:15:01,424 --> 00:15:03,192
Mr. Watson
was a US Air Marshal.

00:15:03,259 --> 00:15:05,228
Right. How could I forget him?

00:15:05,294 --> 00:15:06,429
He threw it in my face

00:15:06,496 --> 00:15:08,631
when I told him
we were out of compacts.

00:15:08,698 --> 00:15:10,366
I'm a US Air Marshal, okay?

00:15:10,433 --> 00:15:12,001
I travel for a living.

00:15:12,068 --> 00:15:13,202
I don't need this crap.

00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:15,671
But you found him a car.

00:15:15,738 --> 00:15:17,473
I'll put you in a full-size

00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,175
and won't charge you
for the difference.

00:15:19,242 --> 00:15:20,710
No, forget it.
I'll take the Camaro.

00:15:20,776 --> 00:15:22,512
What time was that?

00:15:22,578 --> 00:15:24,714
Vehicle entered the lot
at 9:31 p.m.

00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:27,183
Mr. Watson drove out
nine minutes later.

00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,685
Thanks a lot.

00:15:29,752 --> 00:15:31,087
Guy worked for
Homeland Security.

00:15:31,153 --> 00:15:33,422
You think maybe
some terrorist blew him up?

00:15:33,489 --> 00:15:36,159
You'll be the first to know.

00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,562
Well, it's been confirmed.

00:15:39,629 --> 00:15:43,032
The driver, Adam Watson,
was a Federal Air Marshal.

00:15:43,099 --> 00:15:45,701
So, one of us
needs to call the sheriff.

00:15:45,768 --> 00:15:47,003
I'll flip you for it.

00:15:47,069 --> 00:15:48,504
Well, before we make that call,

00:15:48,571 --> 00:15:50,873
what time did the Air Marshal
drive off the lot?

00:15:51,908 --> 00:15:53,609
9:40. Why?

00:15:53,676 --> 00:15:56,612
Well, the bomb went
off 30 minutes later.

00:15:56,679 --> 00:15:58,581
It takes that long to get
from here to the Orpheus.

00:15:58,648 --> 00:16:00,583
So you're saying the bomb
was already in the car

00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:01,784
when he drove out?

00:16:01,851 --> 00:16:03,119
Well, that can't be.

00:16:03,186 --> 00:16:04,820
According to the manager,

00:16:04,887 --> 00:16:08,357
the Camaro was only in the lot
for, uh, nine minutes.

00:16:08,424 --> 00:16:11,227
Well, it takes longer than
that to hard-wire a bomb.

00:16:11,294 --> 00:16:13,896
Which can only mean that the
bomb was already in the car

00:16:13,963 --> 00:16:15,398
when it was returned.

00:16:15,464 --> 00:16:18,134
So, who rented the car
before him?

00:16:18,201 --> 00:16:20,303
BRASS:
<i>Roger Dunbar! Open up!</i>

00:16:20,369 --> 00:16:21,671
<i>Las Vegas Police!</i>

00:16:28,311 --> 00:16:30,246
Clear.

00:16:30,313 --> 00:16:31,414
Stand down.

00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,149
Good job, guys.

00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:36,986
Okay, well.

00:16:37,053 --> 00:16:40,490
This guy was obviously
on a week-to-week lease.

00:16:48,865 --> 00:16:50,633
WILLOWS:
Left some clothes behind...

00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,001
and a paper shredder.

00:16:58,174 --> 00:17:00,309
No sign
of any bomb-making material.

00:17:00,376 --> 00:17:01,978
I'll go check the garage.

00:17:44,687 --> 00:17:48,224
WILLOWS:
"Dr. Amerian, 4:00 p.m."

00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:51,093
Oh, today.

00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,229
I'll make an appointment.

00:17:56,687 --> 00:17:59,423
You drag me out
of my dentist's office.

00:17:59,489 --> 00:18:01,358
You throw me in a squad car.

00:18:01,425 --> 00:18:04,528
Now you're accusing me
of planting a car bomb?

00:18:04,595 --> 00:18:07,631
Mr. Dunbar, you rented a Camaro
from Thrift Rite Rental.

00:18:07,698 --> 00:18:10,133
Returned it last
night, 9:30 p.m.

00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,636
It blew up a half an hour later
in front of the Orpheus.

00:18:12,703 --> 00:18:14,438
It's all over the news.

00:18:14,504 --> 00:18:16,807
That was my Camaro?

00:18:16,874 --> 00:18:18,475
Yes.

00:18:18,542 --> 00:18:19,910
But this is crazy.

00:18:19,977 --> 00:18:21,411
So, what happened?

00:18:21,478 --> 00:18:23,447
You have a beef
with the rental car company?

00:18:23,513 --> 00:18:26,617
No. I-I get double miles.

00:18:26,683 --> 00:18:27,784
I'm a Premier Card member.

00:18:27,851 --> 00:18:29,419
Oh, I'm sure you are.

00:18:29,486 --> 00:18:31,555
You know what,
I'm not saying another word

00:18:31,622 --> 00:18:33,090
without an attorney.

00:18:33,156 --> 00:18:35,492
That's your right, Mr. Dunbar.

00:18:37,361 --> 00:18:38,929
Warrant for your clothes.

00:18:40,964 --> 00:18:42,466
Strip.

00:18:42,532 --> 00:18:44,134
Everything in the bag.

00:19:33,183 --> 00:19:35,953
ID'd the explosive.

00:19:36,019 --> 00:19:37,287
Ammonium perchlorate.

00:19:37,354 --> 00:19:38,789
Yeah, rocket fuel.

00:19:38,855 --> 00:19:42,793
GCMS picked up the other half
of the equation-- gasoline.

00:19:42,859 --> 00:19:46,296
Combination of the two
creates an unstable mass.

00:19:46,363 --> 00:19:48,532
Both shock-
and friction-sensitive.

00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:52,569
Ammonium perchlorate's available
at any chemical supply store.

00:19:52,636 --> 00:19:54,605
You can gas up on every corner.

00:19:54,671 --> 00:19:56,740
Anyone could've made this bomb.

00:19:58,775 --> 00:20:01,011
Sheriff?

00:20:01,078 --> 00:20:03,080
What can we do for you?

00:20:03,146 --> 00:20:04,681
Need a little clarification.

00:20:04,748 --> 00:20:07,284
I know Captain Brass
has a suspect in custody.

00:20:07,351 --> 00:20:09,186
Where it get
a little hazy for me,

00:20:09,253 --> 00:20:12,189
is I'm not getting his
connection to the Air Marshal.

00:20:12,256 --> 00:20:13,557
Well, it's entirely possible

00:20:13,624 --> 00:20:16,493
that Mr. Watson was just in the
wrong place at the wrong time.

00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:20,664
Another thing, you said that
the switch was a digital clock.

00:20:20,731 --> 00:20:24,001
The bomb had been set to go off
at a designated time, right?

00:20:24,067 --> 00:20:26,837
How do we get
a wrong time?

00:20:26,904 --> 00:20:28,505
I can answer that, too.

00:20:28,572 --> 00:20:29,907
Take a look.

00:20:36,647 --> 00:20:38,682
Short in the wire.

00:20:38,749 --> 00:20:41,018
Compromised the
timing device.

00:20:41,084 --> 00:20:42,452
Made the bomb
unpredictable.

00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:45,789
We may never know when that bomb
was supposed to explode.

00:20:47,824 --> 00:20:49,927
I got your page.

00:20:50,928 --> 00:20:52,429
You'd be a good maitre d'.

00:20:52,496 --> 00:20:54,264
Checking glassware for spots?

00:20:54,331 --> 00:20:56,767
You know, a hot tub is just like
a dishwasher.

00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:58,635
Washes away
all of the impurities.

00:20:58,702 --> 00:21:00,737
Including hydrofluoric acid,
huh?

00:21:02,372 --> 00:21:03,974
'93 Pinot.

00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:05,943
( <i>French accent</i> ):
Either it was a bad year
for wine

00:21:06,009 --> 00:21:06,944
or a bad year for Amelia.

00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:08,278
I found trace amounts

00:21:08,345 --> 00:21:10,747
of hydrofluoric acid
in the vino.

00:21:10,814 --> 00:21:12,449
So, somebody did spike the wine.

00:21:12,516 --> 00:21:14,184
<i>Oui.</i>

00:21:14,251 --> 00:21:16,320
BROWN:
We just want to know what
happened the other night.

00:21:16,386 --> 00:21:17,487
Did you open the
bottle for her?

00:21:17,554 --> 00:21:18,655
MAN:
Hey, Amelia requested me.

00:21:18,722 --> 00:21:19,990
I was up there every night.

00:21:20,057 --> 00:21:21,158
I hooked her up.

00:21:21,225 --> 00:21:23,093
And she wasn't drinking
no Italian rotgut either.

00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,330
She was ordering '93 Pinot
from Russian River Valley.

00:21:26,396 --> 00:21:28,832
That's 350 a bottle,
20% delivery charge.

00:21:28,899 --> 00:21:30,234
You do the math.

00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,668
Was anyone there with her?

00:21:31,735 --> 00:21:32,669
No.

00:21:32,736 --> 00:21:33,971
What about Sam Hopkins?

00:21:34,037 --> 00:21:35,138
No, that mutt wasn't there.

00:21:35,205 --> 00:21:36,139
"Mutt"?

00:21:36,206 --> 00:21:37,407
Yeah, that manager scumbag.

00:21:37,474 --> 00:21:39,910
You bring a bottle of wine when
he's there, forget about it.

00:21:39,977 --> 00:21:41,578
He signs for the bill
and stiff city.

00:21:41,645 --> 00:21:43,213
Now, when the Prince of Soul
is there,

00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,348
that's a different story.

00:21:44,414 --> 00:21:45,916
He'd give you $500
just to get lost.

00:21:45,983 --> 00:21:47,584
But you didn't see Myles
the other night?

00:21:47,651 --> 00:21:48,752
Yeah, I saw him for a sec.

00:21:48,819 --> 00:21:49,887
He came in between shows.

00:21:49,953 --> 00:21:50,954
He showed me the door.

00:21:55,025 --> 00:21:55,926
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
My man.

00:21:55,993 --> 00:21:57,261
There's only one man

00:21:57,327 --> 00:21:59,563
who practices chivalry
around here,

00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:01,265
and it ain't you, Ducky.

00:22:04,768 --> 00:22:07,204
Hey, I could tell
they were in love, you know?

00:22:07,271 --> 00:22:08,572
But he was never around.

00:22:08,639 --> 00:22:10,607
I mean,
I felt bad for Amelia.

00:22:10,674 --> 00:22:12,910
She'd have me up three,
four times a night.

00:22:12,976 --> 00:22:13,977
"You forgot the fork.

00:22:14,044 --> 00:22:15,646
Can you bring some salt?
How about some ice?"

00:22:15,712 --> 00:22:17,481
If you ask me,

00:22:17,548 --> 00:22:20,450
I'd say she was lonely.

00:22:20,517 --> 00:22:22,419
Did you ever see them fight?

00:22:22,486 --> 00:22:23,353
No, but I heard 'em.

00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:26,924
And I'm sure 2202
and 2206 heard 'em, too.

00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:29,459
Hey, but I don't bite
the hand that feeds me.

00:22:29,526 --> 00:22:32,195
Thanks.

00:22:45,108 --> 00:22:46,410
There was rocket fuel
in the bomb

00:22:46,476 --> 00:22:47,878
and rocket fuel on your T-shirt.

00:22:49,713 --> 00:22:51,615
That you need to explain.

00:22:51,682 --> 00:22:55,319
Well, I'm not really
sure, but my son,

00:22:55,385 --> 00:22:58,822
he's got this
science project due.

00:22:58,889 --> 00:23:00,524
You're right,
I'm not supposed to help,

00:23:00,591 --> 00:23:01,959
but, really, all the parents do.

00:23:02,025 --> 00:23:04,328
We made a volcano.

00:23:04,394 --> 00:23:08,332
Spilled some of the chemicals.

00:23:08,398 --> 00:23:10,968
( <i>sizzling</i> )

00:23:11,034 --> 00:23:12,069
( <i>gurgling</i> )

00:23:12,135 --> 00:23:13,870
( <i>clatters</i> )

00:23:13,937 --> 00:23:15,706
We've been to your apartment.

00:23:15,772 --> 00:23:17,174
What volcano? What kid?

00:23:17,241 --> 00:23:18,442
Timmy. Third grade.

00:23:18,508 --> 00:23:19,810
Mesquite Elementary.

00:23:19,877 --> 00:23:20,711
You're divorced?

00:23:20,777 --> 00:23:22,145
No.

00:23:22,212 --> 00:23:24,314
No, well, look,
here's the situation

00:23:24,381 --> 00:23:27,317
is the family,
they live in Mesquite,

00:23:27,384 --> 00:23:30,087
and I'm there on the weekends.

00:23:30,153 --> 00:23:31,088
And during the week?

00:23:31,154 --> 00:23:32,456
I-I'm in sales,

00:23:32,522 --> 00:23:35,425
so I travel
all over the country.

00:23:35,492 --> 00:23:37,261
Which is why he rents a car
when he's in town.

00:23:37,327 --> 00:23:38,362
It's cheaper than leasing.

00:23:38,428 --> 00:23:40,764
Cheaper.

00:23:40,831 --> 00:23:43,233
All right, but it still doesn't
explain the empty apartment.

00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,937
Look, I... like being married.

00:23:47,004 --> 00:23:49,740
I... love my wife,

00:23:49,806 --> 00:23:51,375
my kid,

00:23:51,441 --> 00:23:56,346
but... I need my space.

00:23:56,413 --> 00:23:58,715
I don't want to hurt
anyone's feelings,

00:23:58,782 --> 00:23:59,917
so I just tell them

00:23:59,983 --> 00:24:03,520
that I'm out of town
even when I'm not.

00:24:03,587 --> 00:24:07,124
We're going to need
your home address.

00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:08,392
No, look...

00:24:08,458 --> 00:24:10,294
I'm begging you.

00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,263
Please don't blow things for me
with the wife.

00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,937
Mom, what's going on?

00:24:20,003 --> 00:24:22,472
I don't understand.

00:24:22,539 --> 00:24:25,309
Mrs. Dunbar, could you and
your son wait outside, please?

00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:26,310
Ma'am, come
with me.

00:24:26,376 --> 00:24:28,478
I'll fill you in.

00:24:55,906 --> 00:24:58,342
Catherine, there is a volcano
on the table.

00:25:05,148 --> 00:25:08,819
Aluminum powder.

00:25:08,886 --> 00:25:11,154
Polyvinylbutadiene.

00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:17,194
Ammonium perchlorate.

00:25:17,261 --> 00:25:21,565
The three ingredients
to make lava flow.

00:25:21,632 --> 00:25:23,500
In fifth grade,
I built one of these

00:25:23,567 --> 00:25:25,002
as my science fair project.

00:25:25,068 --> 00:25:26,036
It was awesome.

00:25:26,103 --> 00:25:28,038
First place should've been mine.

00:25:28,105 --> 00:25:31,441
But they ended up giving it
to this kid with some lame

00:25:31,508 --> 00:25:34,011
red ant colony.

00:25:35,913 --> 00:25:37,014
That was you.

00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,982
Yeah, only my ants
were Black Argentinians.

00:25:39,049 --> 00:25:40,183
Uh-huh.

00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:43,287
I learned at a very early age
that the bugs always win.

00:25:43,353 --> 00:25:45,422
Right.

00:25:47,291 --> 00:25:50,460
Trust me, Roger
didn't build a bomb.

00:25:50,527 --> 00:25:52,696
I love my husband,
but he's inept.

00:25:52,763 --> 00:25:54,565
Just last week,
the hose bib

00:25:54,631 --> 00:25:55,632
cracked.

00:25:55,699 --> 00:25:56,967
Front yard was a river.

00:25:57,034 --> 00:25:59,002
Roger was helpless
till I got home.

00:25:59,069 --> 00:26:00,804
Well, what about that volcano?

00:26:00,871 --> 00:26:02,673
Your husband said
that he helped

00:26:02,739 --> 00:26:04,541
your son build it.

00:26:04,608 --> 00:26:05,709
He watched.

00:26:05,776 --> 00:26:07,244
I'm a teacher.

00:26:07,311 --> 00:26:09,513
Timmy knows which parent
to go to for help.

00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:13,550
Mrs. Dunbar, your husband
told us that he was in sales.

00:26:15,252 --> 00:26:16,720
He's with the State Department.

00:26:16,787 --> 00:26:21,258
You know, all
that sensitive
government stuff.

00:26:21,325 --> 00:26:23,026
Keeps him on the road.

00:26:23,093 --> 00:26:24,228
He doesn't say much about it.

00:26:24,294 --> 00:26:25,662
As far as you know,

00:26:25,729 --> 00:26:29,066
has he talked about his job
with anyone else?

00:26:29,132 --> 00:26:31,101
Any other family members?
Friends?

00:26:31,168 --> 00:26:32,402
His parents are dead.

00:26:32,469 --> 00:26:33,770
Roger's an only child.

00:26:33,837 --> 00:26:37,241
He doesn't have
time for friends.

00:26:37,307 --> 00:26:40,510
There was this one night,
years ago.

00:26:40,577 --> 00:26:43,647
We were both a little drunk
and...

00:26:43,714 --> 00:26:47,017
Roger confessed he was CIA.

00:26:54,524 --> 00:26:57,895
Hey, I made one of those
in third grade.

00:26:57,961 --> 00:27:00,130
Science fair.

00:27:00,197 --> 00:27:01,131
Should have won, too.

00:27:01,198 --> 00:27:02,199
Got to let it go, Nick.

00:27:03,867 --> 00:27:06,603
Bomb end-cap with tool marks.

00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:09,006
Given the orientation
and spread of the marks,

00:27:09,072 --> 00:27:11,909
consistent with pliers,
vise-grips.

00:27:11,975 --> 00:27:14,912
There were no vise-grips
in the Dunbars' toolbox.

00:27:14,978 --> 00:27:17,748
But given that the bomb
and the volcano

00:27:17,814 --> 00:27:19,850
were similarly
constructed...

00:27:19,917 --> 00:27:22,653
We can compare the tool marks
on both end-caps.

00:27:22,719 --> 00:27:25,656
Doesn't matter what you make;
it's what you make it with.

00:27:35,365 --> 00:27:36,433
Not even close.

00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,701
Mm-mm.

00:27:37,768 --> 00:27:40,904
So, whatever tool
made the volcano

00:27:40,971 --> 00:27:43,040
did not make the bomb.

00:27:43,106 --> 00:27:45,008
Okay, I reconstructed

00:27:45,075 --> 00:27:48,212
the contents of
the paper shredder.

00:27:48,278 --> 00:27:49,279
Five bills.

00:27:49,346 --> 00:27:50,681
All in Roger Dunbar's name.

00:27:50,747 --> 00:27:53,350
Addressed to 2175 La Pressa.

00:27:53,417 --> 00:27:56,720
Mm-hmm.
His apartment.

00:27:56,787 --> 00:27:58,622
Okay, top two are
credit card bills.

00:27:58,689 --> 00:27:59,623
Both VISA.

00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:01,058
Separate accounts.

00:28:01,124 --> 00:28:03,026
WILLOWS:
Roger A. Dunbar.

00:28:03,093 --> 00:28:05,062
Roger B. Dunbar.

00:28:05,128 --> 00:28:07,564
That's an easy way
to separate out expenses.

00:28:07,631 --> 00:28:09,132
Check out the gas bills.

00:28:09,199 --> 00:28:10,734
Three different meters.

00:28:11,902 --> 00:28:14,538
2175 La Pressa.

00:28:14,605 --> 00:28:17,541
822 Devon, Mesquite.

00:28:17,608 --> 00:28:20,477
1845 Galewood, Henderson.

00:28:20,544 --> 00:28:22,546
Hey, got the DNA results back

00:28:22,613 --> 00:28:23,680
from that bloody
Band-Aid

00:28:23,747 --> 00:28:25,582
that Grissom found
at Dunbar's apartment.

00:28:25,649 --> 00:28:27,918
Compared it to his DNA.
Not a match.

00:28:27,985 --> 00:28:29,720
But I did find
seven alleles in common.

00:28:29,786 --> 00:28:31,488
His son.

00:28:31,555 --> 00:28:32,489
No. It's female.

00:28:32,556 --> 00:28:34,157
Mother, sister, daughter.

00:28:34,224 --> 00:28:38,996
Well, according to his wife,
his mother's deceased.

00:28:39,062 --> 00:28:41,698
He's an only child.

00:28:41,765 --> 00:28:43,300
So, that leaves a daughter.

00:28:43,367 --> 00:28:46,503
Well, there's no way there
was a kid at that apartment.

00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:48,505
Well, maybe she was living
in Henderson.

00:28:48,572 --> 00:28:51,441
Forget "secret agent."

00:28:51,508 --> 00:28:54,144
Roger Dunbar was living
a secret life.

00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,135
Can I help you?

00:29:07,505 --> 00:29:09,640
Good evening.

00:29:09,707 --> 00:29:11,842
We're with the Las
Vegas Crime Lab.

00:29:11,909 --> 00:29:13,344
Oh, God.

00:29:13,411 --> 00:29:16,046
Did something happen
to my husband?

00:29:16,113 --> 00:29:17,882
He was supposed to be home
on Monday night.

00:29:17,948 --> 00:29:19,884
I've been calling his cell.
He's not at work.

00:29:20,985 --> 00:29:22,420
Is this your husband?

00:29:22,486 --> 00:29:23,421
Yes.

00:29:23,487 --> 00:29:24,989
You're currently
married to him?

00:29:25,056 --> 00:29:26,323
Yes. What is going on?

00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:29,693
WILLOWS:
Well, your husband is a suspect

00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,228
in a criminal
investigation.

00:29:31,295 --> 00:29:33,130
Currently, he's
in police custody.

00:29:35,866 --> 00:29:37,168
GRISSOM:
Mrs. Dunbar?

00:29:38,903 --> 00:29:41,639
Do you have a daughter?

00:29:41,705 --> 00:29:42,640
Amy.

00:29:42,706 --> 00:29:46,477
Is she entered
in the science fair?

00:29:47,578 --> 00:29:49,013
You can't take it.

00:29:50,014 --> 00:29:51,982
Amy, did you use this the tool

00:29:52,049 --> 00:29:54,452
to work on the inside
of your volcano?

00:29:54,518 --> 00:29:55,619
Yeah, my dad did.

00:29:55,686 --> 00:29:57,555
He helped you build it?

00:29:57,621 --> 00:29:59,123
Yeah.

00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:00,124
I teach yoga.

00:30:00,191 --> 00:30:02,393
I have no idea
how this works.

00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,228
It was all Roger.

00:30:04,295 --> 00:30:06,097
When's your science fair?

00:30:06,163 --> 00:30:07,965
Friday.

00:30:08,032 --> 00:30:10,334
Well, we'll do our best
to get this back to you

00:30:10,401 --> 00:30:12,169
by Friday, okay?

00:30:12,236 --> 00:30:13,370
Okay.

00:30:15,206 --> 00:30:17,208
BROWN:
Which side do you want?

00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:19,376
SIDLE:
I'll take the west wing.

00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:22,279
It's a nice place.

00:30:22,346 --> 00:30:23,514
Uh-huh.

00:30:30,988 --> 00:30:33,758
You could record a whole album

00:30:33,824 --> 00:30:35,826
in this studio.

00:30:35,893 --> 00:30:37,995
This guy's got it made.

00:30:38,062 --> 00:30:41,232
The life of a celebrity.

00:30:46,937 --> 00:30:50,674
( <i>plays jazz riff</i> )

00:30:55,012 --> 00:30:57,081
I don't know, I think
it sounds kind of isolating,

00:30:57,148 --> 00:30:58,015
living in a fishbowl.

00:30:58,082 --> 00:30:59,517
Wouldn't be isolated.

00:30:59,583 --> 00:31:03,254
You'd have a butler, a maid
service, laundry service.

00:31:04,855 --> 00:31:06,757
Sheet music.

00:31:06,824 --> 00:31:08,926
Guy writes his own stuff.

00:31:13,531 --> 00:31:15,032
Dishwashing gloves.

00:31:15,099 --> 00:31:18,569
Dry erase markers.

00:31:18,636 --> 00:31:21,806
Slate Industrial Glass Cleaner.

00:31:21,872 --> 00:31:24,208
The ingredients--

00:31:24,275 --> 00:31:25,576
distilled water
and hydrofluoric acid.

00:31:27,711 --> 00:31:29,213
Fatal if swallowed.

00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:36,420
You're sure you want to waive
your right to an attorney?

00:31:36,487 --> 00:31:39,056
I got nothin' to hide.

00:31:39,123 --> 00:31:41,926
Do you recognize this product?

00:31:43,761 --> 00:31:45,062
Yeah.

00:31:45,129 --> 00:31:46,564
I use it to clean my windows.

00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:49,467
Don't you have a maid or someone
to do that for you?

00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:51,168
I write songs late at night.

00:31:51,235 --> 00:31:53,070

your wife was poisoned.

00:32:04,014 --> 00:32:06,951
We suspect window cleaner
was slipped into her wine.

00:32:07,017 --> 00:32:07,952
It can't be.

00:32:08,018 --> 00:32:08,986
I was there.

00:32:09,053 --> 00:32:10,654
I opened that wine.

00:32:10,721 --> 00:32:12,256
Did you have a fight?

00:32:12,323 --> 00:32:13,824
Not lately.

from the same place, man.

00:32:23,067 --> 00:32:24,802
It's passion.

00:32:24,869 --> 00:32:27,905
And we loved each other
passionately.

00:32:31,075 --> 00:32:34,145
When we met, it was fate.

She was looking
for the same thing.

00:33:07,511 --> 00:33:09,480
She loved my music.

00:33:11,882 --> 00:33:13,517
I loved her smile.

00:33:13,584 --> 00:33:17,988
It's hard being on top,

00:33:18,055 --> 00:33:20,424
I mean,
everybody loves you.

00:33:20,491 --> 00:33:22,226
Wants their piece.

00:33:24,595 --> 00:33:26,297
That's why we fought.

00:33:26,363 --> 00:33:28,399
The time.

00:33:31,001 --> 00:33:34,071
She knew she could never
have me to herself.

00:33:36,507 --> 00:33:39,477
Look, I got sound check
for the late show in an hour.

00:33:39,543 --> 00:33:40,478
Can I go?

00:33:40,544 --> 00:33:41,545
Sure.

00:33:44,915 --> 00:33:47,151
We might want to talk
to you later.

00:33:51,355 --> 00:33:54,191
Wife's been dead
less than 48 hours.

00:33:54,258 --> 00:33:55,192
Well, there's a man

00:33:55,259 --> 00:33:57,128
who definitely has
his priorities straight.

00:33:57,194 --> 00:34:00,131
Okay, three people have admitted
to being with Amelia

00:34:00,197 --> 00:34:01,499
the night that she died.

00:34:01,565 --> 00:34:04,468
The room service waiter,
Myles, and Myles's manager.

00:34:04,535 --> 00:34:05,803
Room service guy's out.

00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:07,838
He left before the cork
was popped.

00:34:07,905 --> 00:34:11,075
So, did Myles kill Amelia and
the manager's covering for him

00:34:11,142 --> 00:34:15,212
or did the manager kill Amelia
and Myles doesn't have a clue?

00:34:15,279 --> 00:34:18,249
BRASS:
Bigamy is a Class D Felony.

00:34:18,315 --> 00:34:19,483
If convicted,

00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:22,019
you could be sentenced
from one to four years

00:34:22,086 --> 00:34:23,487
in prison, do
you know that?

00:34:23,554 --> 00:34:25,956
I'd just married Beth,
when I met Debbie.

00:34:26,023 --> 00:34:27,091
She was a student.

00:34:27,158 --> 00:34:29,994
UNLV.

00:34:30,061 --> 00:34:31,462
She got pregnant.

00:34:31,529 --> 00:34:33,364
I did the right thing.

00:34:33,431 --> 00:34:38,436
Ever since, it's been
Monday through Friday

00:34:38,502 --> 00:34:41,372
with Debbie
and weekends with Beth.

00:34:41,439 --> 00:34:43,507
They both think I travel
for a living.

00:34:43,574 --> 00:34:45,409
I know I keep
coming back to this,

00:34:45,476 --> 00:34:47,745
but, uh...
I mean, I got to ask you.

00:34:47,812 --> 00:34:49,880
What's with the empty apartment?

00:34:49,947 --> 00:34:52,550
Do you have a girlfriend
on the side as well?

00:34:52,616 --> 00:34:53,617
No.

00:34:56,053 --> 00:34:57,688
Just tell them the truth.

00:35:01,692 --> 00:35:05,096
My life is really
a balancing act.

00:35:05,162 --> 00:35:07,131
Early on,
I took Debbie to dinner

00:35:07,198 --> 00:35:09,834
and Beth saw it
on a credit card statement.

00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,936
So instead of a P.O. Box,

00:35:12,002 --> 00:35:17,475
I figured why not rent
a cheap apartment, you know?

00:35:17,541 --> 00:35:20,344
Have a night to myself
once in a while.

00:35:20,411 --> 00:35:23,881
We found a Band-Aid with
your daughter Amy's blood

00:35:23,948 --> 00:35:25,216
at your apartment.

00:35:25,282 --> 00:35:29,086
So, you bring your daughter
there, but not your wives?

00:35:29,153 --> 00:35:31,956
Oh, no.
It's not like that.

00:35:32,022 --> 00:35:34,392
You know how kids are.

00:35:34,458 --> 00:35:35,493
Dad, take this.

00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:37,161
It keeps falling off.

00:35:40,698 --> 00:35:43,701
I emptied my pockets
at the apartment.

00:35:43,768 --> 00:35:45,503
Mr. Dunbar, we collected

00:35:45,569 --> 00:35:47,938
both of your
children's volcanoes

00:35:48,005 --> 00:35:49,740
and supplies.

00:35:49,807 --> 00:35:54,245
And we found a pair of pliers
at your home in Henderson.

00:35:54,311 --> 00:35:57,748
Those pliers were used to make
both of the volcanoes.

00:35:57,815 --> 00:35:58,749
That's right.

00:35:58,816 --> 00:36:00,484
I needed pliers in Henderson,

00:36:00,551 --> 00:36:03,087
so I borrowed Beth's pliers
from Mesquite.

00:36:03,154 --> 00:36:04,822
There's no crime in that.

00:36:04,889 --> 00:36:07,258
I'm just really confused.

00:36:07,324 --> 00:36:10,728
Um... your wife, Beth, told us

00:36:10,795 --> 00:36:14,498
that you couldn't build
a volcano to save your soul.

00:36:14,565 --> 00:36:16,133
Yet your wife, Debbie, claims

00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:19,203
that it was all you that made
your daughter's volcano.

00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:20,471
So, what is it?

00:36:20,538 --> 00:36:24,341
Well, I watched Beth
when she made Timmy's volcano.

00:36:24,408 --> 00:36:26,010
So, then when Amy had

00:36:26,077 --> 00:36:27,645
a science project,

00:36:27,711 --> 00:36:28,846
I knew the drill.

00:36:28,913 --> 00:36:31,415
Now, granted, it wasn't
as symmetrical as Beth's

00:36:31,482 --> 00:36:33,451
and the lava flow
was a little anemic,

00:36:33,517 --> 00:36:36,620
but... Amy liked it.

00:36:36,687 --> 00:36:38,689
When did you borrow
those pliers?

00:36:38,756 --> 00:36:39,890
I don't know.

00:36:39,957 --> 00:36:41,525
Couple weeks ago.

00:36:41,592 --> 00:36:42,860
Why?

00:36:42,927 --> 00:36:45,796
You never returned them
to your wife, Beth?

00:36:47,765 --> 00:36:50,134
I've been meaning to do that.

00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:58,109
Same characteristics.
We got a match.

00:37:00,377 --> 00:37:01,879
Take her in.

00:37:28,139 --> 00:37:30,307
I got prints.

00:37:30,374 --> 00:37:32,443
I've got burns.

00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:34,612
You first.

00:37:34,678 --> 00:37:35,813
Sam or Myles?

00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,748
Amelia's.

00:37:44,188 --> 00:37:45,489
Well, you're
just in time.

00:37:45,556 --> 00:37:46,857
She gets shipped in an hour.

00:37:46,924 --> 00:37:48,626
This should just
take a second.

00:37:48,692 --> 00:37:50,561
Could you give me
her right hand, please?

00:37:57,001 --> 00:37:58,469
SARA:
Three acid burns.

00:37:58,536 --> 00:38:01,005
This is not a murder.

00:38:01,072 --> 00:38:02,606
It's a suicide.

00:38:32,036 --> 00:38:35,139
I knew she wasn't happy.

00:38:35,206 --> 00:38:37,141
I guess I just
didn't pay attention.

00:38:37,208 --> 00:38:39,744
You shouldn't blame
yourself for this.

00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:41,712
Shouldn't I? Why shouldn't I?

00:38:41,779 --> 00:38:45,116
I spend most of my time
making them happy.

00:38:45,182 --> 00:38:46,817
I never...

00:38:46,884 --> 00:38:48,853

in your car's glove box.

00:39:51,015 --> 00:39:54,118
You used them
to fix the faucet.

00:39:54,185 --> 00:39:56,353
And to...

His other wife's name is Debbie.

00:40:10,334 --> 00:40:13,304
Once or twice a year
he'd call me by that name.

00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:14,839
I ignored it.

00:40:14,905 --> 00:40:16,807
It's very difficult
for two people to live a lie,

00:40:16,874 --> 00:40:18,676
let alone three.

00:40:18,743 --> 00:40:20,678
Look, when Roger and I
were together,

00:40:20,745 --> 00:40:21,846
he was a good husband.

00:40:21,912 --> 00:40:22,847
Terrific father.

00:40:22,913 --> 00:40:26,584
It was almost like
being in a state of

suspended honeymoon.

00:40:29,286 --> 00:40:31,288
Really?

00:40:31,355 --> 00:40:33,290
So what changed?

00:40:33,357 --> 00:40:35,226
He asked me
to get his dirty laundry

00:40:35,292 --> 00:40:36,927

00:40:54,478 --> 00:40:56,614
but never...

00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:59,049
another family.

00:41:01,552 --> 00:41:05,022
Two weeks ago Sunday,
I followed him.

00:41:05,089 --> 00:41:08,392
He, uh, dropped off
his rental car and walked

00:41:08,459 --> 00:41:09,894
to some apartment
building.

00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,063
Then he changed
his clothes,

00:41:12,129 --> 00:41:15,099
and got into a nicer car,

00:41:15,166 --> 00:41:17,368
and drove out to Henderson.

00:41:17,435 --> 00:41:20,638
Why didn't you just leave him?
Turn him in?

00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:24,942
He made a fool out of me.

00:41:25,009 --> 00:41:27,611
A mockery of our life.

00:41:27,678 --> 00:41:30,181
Mrs. Dunbar, you killed
three innocent people.

00:41:30,247 --> 00:41:34,285
That was never my intention.

00:41:34,351 --> 00:41:37,888
That bomb was supposed
to go off at 8:30.

00:41:37,955 --> 00:41:39,824
On his way to the airport.

00:41:41,258 --> 00:41:43,194
Why a bomb?

00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:47,998
It, it's not much harder
to make a bomb than a volcano.
