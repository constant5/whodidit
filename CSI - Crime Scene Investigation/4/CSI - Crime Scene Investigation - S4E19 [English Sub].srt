FIREMAN:
Knock it down.

00:00:54,657 --> 00:00:56,259
WOMAN:
Sam? Where is Sam?

00:00:56,325 --> 00:00:57,393
What about Sam?! Sam!

00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,095
I'm going to need you
to stay right here, ma'am.

00:00:59,161 --> 00:01:01,097
Sam.

00:01:01,163 --> 00:01:03,332
Where is he?
Where is...?

00:01:04,834 --> 00:01:07,303
Okay, we got him.

00:01:08,671 --> 00:01:09,839
Here you go, pal.

00:01:09,906 --> 00:01:12,275
You stay right here
with your mom.

00:01:12,341 --> 00:01:15,111
( <i>talks quietly</i> )

00:01:15,178 --> 00:01:16,479
Ma'am,
is there anybody else in there?

00:01:16,546 --> 00:01:17,647
No.

00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,822
( <i>firemen shouting orders</i> )

00:01:26,889 --> 00:01:28,524
Hey.

00:01:28,591 --> 00:01:30,059
STOKES:
What's with the 911 page?

00:01:30,126 --> 00:01:31,894
Fire's not even out yet.

00:01:31,961 --> 00:01:32,995
Jack's an arson investigator.

00:01:33,062 --> 00:01:34,730
We were here on this same street
ten days ago.

00:01:34,797 --> 00:01:36,132
Garage fire a few houses down.

00:01:36,199 --> 00:01:37,133
Deemed intentional.

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,134
So you think it's a serial?

00:01:38,201 --> 00:01:39,302
I don't know,

00:01:39,368 --> 00:01:40,670
but I'm keeping my eyes peeled.

00:01:40,736 --> 00:01:43,739
Maybe they came back
to take a look.

00:01:43,806 --> 00:01:45,408
FIREMAN:
We got another one.
Got another one.

00:01:48,945 --> 00:01:50,146
Sabrina?

00:01:50,213 --> 00:01:51,314
We need a paramedic
right now.

00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:52,481
She's not breathing.

00:01:52,548 --> 00:01:54,250
Sabrina,
what are you doing here?

00:01:54,317 --> 00:01:56,452
You weren't supposed to be here.

00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:57,687
Sabrina?

I heard you say she wasn't

00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,078
Was she with her dad?

00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:09,080
My husband died five years
ago in a car accident.

00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,282
She...

00:03:10,348 --> 00:03:13,318
was at her friend Molly's
house for a sleep-over.

00:03:14,352 --> 00:03:17,689
At least she was
when I went to bed.

00:03:17,756 --> 00:03:20,759
What time was that?

00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:24,830
I don't know, 11:00, 11:30.

00:03:24,896 --> 00:03:28,366
Mrs. Abernathy,
do you have any idea

00:03:28,433 --> 00:03:31,436
what may have caused the fire?

00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:34,439
I go to bed,
I make sure the lights are off,

00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:35,941
lock the doors.

00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:39,110
Do you know anyone who might
want to set fire to your home?

00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:40,378
I go to work.

00:03:40,445 --> 00:03:42,614
I take care of my kids
and my mother,

00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:44,716
and that's my life.

00:03:49,287 --> 00:03:50,889
Thanks a lot.

00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:53,525
Okay, folks, any information

00:03:53,592 --> 00:03:55,060
you feel like you may have...

00:03:55,126 --> 00:03:58,563
How am I going
to get my Fosamax?

00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:59,698
Oh, well, I'll make sure

00:03:59,764 --> 00:04:01,800
you have your medications
by breakfast, okay?

00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:03,068
You're going to
be all right.

00:04:03,134 --> 00:04:04,369
Everything's okay.

00:04:04,436 --> 00:04:07,205
This man will take care of you,
okay?

00:04:07,272 --> 00:04:08,406
What does that one do?

00:04:08,473 --> 00:04:09,574
MAN:
That one?

00:04:09,641 --> 00:04:11,176
That turns
on the siren,

00:04:11,243 --> 00:04:14,212
so we can get to
places really fast.

00:04:14,279 --> 00:04:16,548
To help people burning inside?

00:04:16,615 --> 00:04:18,216
That's right.

00:04:18,283 --> 00:04:21,453
But not my sister.

00:04:23,154 --> 00:04:25,190
Yeah.

00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:28,059
I'm sorry, buddy.

00:04:28,126 --> 00:04:31,296
It's okay.

00:04:38,303 --> 00:04:40,839
BRASS:
So the morning cleaning
crew found him.

00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:43,942
No ID,
but this was in his pocket.

00:04:44,009 --> 00:04:46,778
Looks like
some kind of code.

00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:52,517
"735"?

00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:54,119
His goal weight?

00:04:55,153 --> 00:04:58,690
I'm going to talk
to housekeeping.

00:05:03,461 --> 00:05:05,964
( <i>latches clicking</i> )

00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:19,044
That's a nasty head wound.

00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,613
It's always reassuring
to see an empty soap dispenser

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,249
in a public bathroom.

00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:33,783
So I'm thinking this is how
the vic got his head smashed in.

00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,596
( <i>glass breaks, man yells</i> )

00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:43,168
Thank you.

00:05:54,513 --> 00:05:57,349
It's common to find something
in blood.

00:05:57,415 --> 00:05:59,818
Uncommon to find
something on blood.

00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:11,463
Petechial hemorrhaging.

00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:13,865
Asphyxia.

00:06:13,932 --> 00:06:15,700
Head bashed in
and asphyxiated.

00:06:15,767 --> 00:06:18,503
No soap
was the least of his problems.

00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:23,642
JACK:
<i>The smoke detectors'</i>
<i>batteries are all dead.</i>

00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:24,943
Sabrina's was the only bedroom

00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,578
that sustained any
fire damage at all.

00:06:26,645 --> 00:06:29,848
Her mother thought
that she wasn't home.

00:06:29,915 --> 00:06:31,383
( <i>camera shutter clicks</i> )

00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:33,251
WILLOWS:
But she wasn't asleep.

00:06:33,318 --> 00:06:35,353
Not in her bed.

00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:46,832
That would explain
why the firemen

00:06:46,898 --> 00:06:48,266
didn't find her right away.

00:06:49,634 --> 00:06:51,670
But it doesn't explain
what she was doing down there.

00:06:51,736 --> 00:06:55,240
If you can explain the behavior
of teenagers, more power to you.

00:06:56,274 --> 00:06:58,276
The adhesive they use

00:06:58,343 --> 00:07:00,045
to put this stuff down
is highly flammable.

00:07:00,111 --> 00:07:01,680
Crack in the linoleum,

00:07:01,746 --> 00:07:03,348
<i>the fire will just seek it out</i>
<i>and go for it.</i>

00:07:20,465 --> 00:07:22,434
This door's unlocked.

00:07:22,501 --> 00:07:24,069
The firemen said they only used

00:07:24,135 --> 00:07:26,371
one point of entry and exit:
the front door.

00:07:26,438 --> 00:07:30,442
Mrs. Abernathy said that she
locked all the doors before bed.

00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:32,777
Well, this could be
how Sabrina got in.

00:07:32,844 --> 00:07:36,047
Comes home late, forgets
to lock the door behind her.

00:07:36,114 --> 00:07:38,450
It's an opportunity
waiting to happen.

00:07:38,517 --> 00:07:40,719
Check out the living room.

00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:44,456
A few cheap,
wood panel walls.

00:07:44,523 --> 00:07:46,958
Polyester curtains,
couple of fake plants.

00:07:47,025 --> 00:07:49,094
All highly flammable.

00:07:49,161 --> 00:07:50,428
Plus...

00:07:50,495 --> 00:07:55,534
a bar full of liquid fire
with a low flash point.

00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,636
( <i>bottle clanks</i> )

00:07:57,702 --> 00:07:59,738
Coffee table.

00:07:59,804 --> 00:08:01,540
Couch?

00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:04,543
At some point, I think
this was a couch.

00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:07,979
This looks like
a liquid pour pattern.

00:08:08,046 --> 00:08:10,048
High-intensity burn.

00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:11,616
You think this could be

00:08:11,683 --> 00:08:13,118
the point of origin?

00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:21,126
I think this is the area
of heaviest damage.

00:08:21,193 --> 00:08:23,528
The fire spread up and
out towards the kitchen.

00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,257
How'd you do?

00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:56,595
Uh, couple of
weak partials.

00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:58,597
What you got, partner?

00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,198
Newspapers.

00:09:00,265 --> 00:09:02,000
I found them
in the carport.

00:09:02,067 --> 00:09:03,869
That's on the other side
of the house.

00:09:03,935 --> 00:09:05,971
Yeah, it's kind of weird.

00:09:06,037 --> 00:09:07,339
Completely
out of the path of the fire

00:09:07,405 --> 00:09:09,040
and the firemen said
they didn't put them there.

00:09:09,107 --> 00:09:10,942
You know the fire down
the street was in the garage.

00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:13,411
Well, maybe he started
in the carport,

00:09:13,478 --> 00:09:15,647
Sabrina came home,
provided access

00:09:15,714 --> 00:09:16,882
to the inside of the house.

00:09:16,948 --> 00:09:19,017
Did they find an accelerant
at the first scene?

00:09:19,084 --> 00:09:21,052
Lighter fluid in the garage.

00:09:21,119 --> 00:09:22,487
So maybe part of the MO.

00:09:22,554 --> 00:09:25,023
is that he uses accelerants
that are present.

00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:28,126
Let's hope he stuck around long
enough to witness the damage.

00:09:29,895 --> 00:09:32,497
STOKES:
This is home video
from the first fire.

00:09:32,564 --> 00:09:34,499
It looks like
everybody's neighbor.

00:09:34,566 --> 00:09:37,869
Well, they say arsonists
often commit crimes

00:09:37,936 --> 00:09:40,172
where they feel
most familiar.

00:09:40,238 --> 00:09:43,074
The last fire was set
during the day in the garage

00:09:43,141 --> 00:09:44,976
when the family was out of town.

00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:47,212
A neighbor would know
when people were out of town.

00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,481
Or when the door
was left unlocked.

00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:50,982
If this is a
serial situation,

00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:52,384
to go from an empty garage

00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:54,219
to a whole house full of people,

00:09:54,286 --> 00:09:56,755
we're talking
about a major escalation here.

00:09:56,821 --> 00:09:59,157
Well, a match was found
at the first fire.

00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:02,561
If we could find a match in
the debris of the second fire,

00:10:02,627 --> 00:10:04,596
then we may know for sure.

00:10:04,663 --> 00:10:06,932
Oh, she looks familiar.

00:10:06,998 --> 00:10:09,734
Hang on. I may have something.

00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:14,606
She was at both fires.

00:10:14,673 --> 00:10:17,576
I got her name
off the canvas.

00:10:17,642 --> 00:10:19,077
Let's run her.

00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:27,419
She has a record.

00:10:30,488 --> 00:10:32,958
STOKES:
<i>You were arrested</i>
<i>for attempted arson?</i>

00:10:33,024 --> 00:10:35,594
I was exonerated.

00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:39,865
I have you on film

00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:43,368
at both fires on
Cell Crook Road.

00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:45,937
I am not an arsonist.

00:10:46,004 --> 00:10:47,739
That's not what your file says.

00:10:47,806 --> 00:10:50,141
The law doesn't make
much of a distinction

00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:52,544
between arsonists
and pyromaniacs.

00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:54,713
What is the distinction?

00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,781
I don't set fires for money

00:10:56,848 --> 00:10:59,451
or with the intent
to cause damage.

00:10:59,518 --> 00:11:01,486
But you do set fires?

00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:06,258
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:11:06,324 --> 00:11:08,760
Mm.

00:11:08,827 --> 00:11:13,899
You go home at night,
and you feel a little lonely,

00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:15,433
you put in
a racy video.

00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,935
No, no, no.

00:11:17,002 --> 00:11:18,570
We're not talking about me.

00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:20,772
I go home,

00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:27,279
I rip open my junk mail,
and I put it in the fireplace.

00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:36,154
It's an impulse control
disorder...

00:11:36,221 --> 00:11:37,989
but it's private.

00:11:38,056 --> 00:11:40,826
I don't burn down houses
and kill children.

00:11:40,892 --> 00:11:45,330
Maybe not on purpose,
but accidents do happen.

00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,775
You rang?

00:11:53,841 --> 00:11:56,110
Yeah. Greg, how'd you
like to be listed

00:11:56,177 --> 00:11:58,046
as an assist
on an arson case?

00:11:58,112 --> 00:11:59,814
Is that
a rhetorical question?

00:11:59,881 --> 00:12:01,215
Cool.

00:12:01,282 --> 00:12:03,418
I collected these matchbooks
from the pyromaniac's house,

00:12:03,484 --> 00:12:04,919
who was...

00:12:04,986 --> 00:12:07,322
kind of hot, actually.

00:12:07,388 --> 00:12:09,957
Really? You dig chicks
who dig fire?

00:12:12,126 --> 00:12:15,496
Yeah. This, uh... this match
was used to start a garage fire

00:12:15,563 --> 00:12:16,965
a couple of weeks ago.

00:12:17,031 --> 00:12:19,534
See if you can find
a match to...

00:12:21,169 --> 00:12:23,071
...one of those.

00:12:23,137 --> 00:12:24,706
Thanks, Dell.

00:12:27,575 --> 00:12:29,177
All right, David.

00:12:29,243 --> 00:12:31,612
The three most common ways

00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:33,081
to asphyxiate:

00:12:33,147 --> 00:12:35,116
strangulation,
suffocation and...

00:12:35,183 --> 00:12:36,017
Choking.

00:12:36,084 --> 00:12:37,185
Good.
With this guy,

00:12:37,251 --> 00:12:39,020
my money's on choking.

00:12:43,324 --> 00:12:44,659
Scissors.

00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,258
Hmm.

00:13:26,534 --> 00:13:27,969
An "S"?

00:13:28,036 --> 00:13:29,437
Cause of death.

00:13:30,872 --> 00:13:34,008
<i>Found it in the trachea.</i>

00:13:34,075 --> 00:13:40,046
So, he swallows a tile and tries
to give himself a Heimlich?

00:13:46,621 --> 00:13:48,256
Or not.

00:13:48,323 --> 00:13:49,924
I found these
in his stomach.

00:13:51,492 --> 00:13:53,528
You don't swallow
six of them

00:13:53,594 --> 00:13:55,196
by accident.

00:14:31,132 --> 00:14:34,369
Your hottie's matchbook
collection came up dead.

00:14:34,435 --> 00:14:36,771
Hmm. Doesn't mean
she didn't do it.

00:14:36,838 --> 00:14:39,040
True.
You know, arson's
usually a property crime.

00:14:39,107 --> 00:14:40,408
Did you ever find out

00:14:40,475 --> 00:14:42,810
the Abernathys'
financial situation, Warrick?

00:14:42,877 --> 00:14:44,245
According to Catherine,

00:14:44,312 --> 00:14:46,314
Jessica Abernathy had
major credit card debt

00:14:46,381 --> 00:14:48,416
but minimal insurance--
not even enough

00:14:48,483 --> 00:14:50,318
to cover what she had.

00:14:50,385 --> 00:14:53,087
Besides, people tend
to remove mementos

00:14:53,154 --> 00:14:55,823
when they know what's coming.

00:14:57,825 --> 00:15:00,695
So, if the pyro
didn't do it for love,

00:15:00,762 --> 00:15:03,064
and Mrs. A didn't do it
for money,

00:15:03,131 --> 00:15:04,332
who's left?

00:15:06,434 --> 00:15:08,336
Maybe the high school
baseball team.

00:15:09,704 --> 00:15:11,673
<i>McKinley High School Gazette.</i>

00:15:11,739 --> 00:15:14,642
This is tomorrow's edition
with the lead story

00:15:14,709 --> 00:15:18,112
by Editor-in-Chief
Sabrina Abernathy, entitled

00:15:18,179 --> 00:15:21,149
"Varsity Hazing Ritual."

00:15:21,215 --> 00:15:22,917
Now listen to this...

00:15:22,984 --> 00:15:25,553
"The question is not whether
the so-called student athletes

00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,956
should be expelled, but whether
or not they should be arrested."

00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,658
Why, what'd they do?
Apparently,

00:15:30,725 --> 00:15:33,828
something with several hookers
and a lot of testosterone.

00:15:33,895 --> 00:15:36,831
Whatever happened
to toilet paper and trees?

00:15:45,374 --> 00:15:47,042
Hey. DNA came back.

00:15:47,109 --> 00:15:49,712
Blood from the bathroom floor's
a match to the vic.

00:15:49,778 --> 00:15:51,981
Blood from the bathroom mirror
is not.

00:15:53,015 --> 00:15:54,984
That's interesting.

00:15:56,952 --> 00:15:58,120
What are you doing?

00:15:58,187 --> 00:16:00,322
Anagrams.
You think
the letters

00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:01,991
might be a message
from the killer?

00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,995
Six letters.
What is that?

00:16:06,061 --> 00:16:08,764
That's 720
possible combinations,

00:16:08,831 --> 00:16:11,500
not all of them
words, of course.

00:16:17,172 --> 00:16:19,074
Hmm.

00:16:20,109 --> 00:16:22,811
You, uh, missed one.

00:16:26,915 --> 00:16:28,684
Hey. We got an ID.

00:16:28,751 --> 00:16:29,852
off your DB's prints.

00:16:29,918 --> 00:16:31,687
His name is
Adam Brenner.

00:16:31,754 --> 00:16:33,555
That guy has a record?

00:16:33,622 --> 00:16:35,190
Well, sort of.
He's a civil servant.

00:16:35,257 --> 00:16:36,892
He's a postal worker
from Orlando.

00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,228
Do we know why he came to Vegas?

00:16:39,295 --> 00:16:41,463
Oh, you're going to love this.

00:16:54,109 --> 00:16:56,211
WOMAN:
Challenge.

00:16:56,278 --> 00:16:59,148
Adam Brenner was one
of our top Division One players.

00:16:59,214 --> 00:17:00,649
Ranked in the high 1,800s.

00:17:00,716 --> 00:17:01,817
Is that like
the ELO system

00:17:01,884 --> 00:17:03,152
in chess?

00:17:03,218 --> 00:17:04,820
Logos has all the skill of chess

00:17:04,887 --> 00:17:06,555
combined with the cruel whimsy
of fate.

00:17:06,622 --> 00:17:08,924
Adam once set
a tournament record

00:17:08,991 --> 00:17:11,226
by scoring 735 points
in a single game.

00:17:11,293 --> 00:17:12,695
It was on his T-shirt.

00:17:12,761 --> 00:17:14,897
Justifiably.
It's an incredible achievement.

00:17:14,964 --> 00:17:16,398
So, how did the
other players feel

00:17:16,465 --> 00:17:17,866
about that kind
of smack-down?

00:17:17,933 --> 00:17:20,202
You actually suggesting
that somebody here killed Adam?

00:17:20,269 --> 00:17:21,770
BRASS:
Cruel whimsy of fate.

00:17:21,837 --> 00:17:24,406
Guy's from out of town,
takes a cab

00:17:24,473 --> 00:17:26,041
from..., checks
into the hotel.

00:17:26,108 --> 00:17:27,843
The only thing
on his hotel bill

00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:29,678
is four meals a day.

00:17:29,745 --> 00:17:31,246
No phone calls.

00:17:31,313 --> 00:17:34,216
So everybody he talked
to is in this room.

00:17:34,283 --> 00:17:36,518
We're going to need a
list of his opponents.

00:17:36,585 --> 00:17:37,653
Yes...

00:17:43,425 --> 00:17:45,194
What's with the cop?

00:17:45,261 --> 00:17:46,395
We're just talking.

00:17:46,462 --> 00:17:48,030
Yeah, about what?

00:17:48,097 --> 00:17:50,799
Sabrina Abernathy died
in her home in a fire

00:17:50,866 --> 00:17:53,035
on Saturday night.
Hey!

00:17:53,102 --> 00:17:54,270
What'd I tell you--
you don't waste

00:17:54,336 --> 00:17:56,939
a good pitch!

00:17:57,006 --> 00:17:59,308
Cody, where were you
around 1:00 a.m. on Saturday?

00:18:00,342 --> 00:18:01,877
In bed.

00:18:01,944 --> 00:18:03,145
Cody's in bed every
night at 10:00.

00:18:03,212 --> 00:18:04,880
He gets up at 5:00
to go running.

00:18:04,947 --> 00:18:07,082
Except for the nights the team's
pulling a train on a hooker.

00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:09,485
Cody, keep hitting.

00:18:12,288 --> 00:18:13,922
This is Vegas.

00:18:13,989 --> 00:18:15,057
Who hasn't been
with a hooker?

00:18:15,124 --> 00:18:16,258
Well, most high school seniors

00:18:16,325 --> 00:18:18,060
who are being scouted
by Division One schools.

00:18:18,127 --> 00:18:19,828
I don't think
an expulsion

00:18:19,895 --> 00:18:21,230
and an arrest

00:18:21,297 --> 00:18:22,731
would look too good

00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:25,167
on a scholarship application.
It's a tradition.

00:18:25,234 --> 00:18:26,835
Happens every year
with every team,

00:18:26,902 --> 00:18:28,971
and why that little bitch
had to scapegoat Cody,

00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:30,673
I'll never know.

00:18:30,739 --> 00:18:32,675
How 'bout you, Cody?
Do you know?

00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:38,280
Look, I'm sorry the girl's dead.

00:18:38,347 --> 00:18:39,415
Yeah, but you're not real sorry

00:18:39,481 --> 00:18:40,749
the whole mess died with her,
are you?

00:18:40,816 --> 00:18:42,851
Yeah, but burning
the kid's house down?

00:18:42,918 --> 00:18:44,954
Come on. Give my son
a little credit.

00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,856
( <i>fence clangs</i> )
Thanks for your help.

00:18:48,924 --> 00:18:50,960
MAN:
Hey, hey, hey,
no flash drawing.

00:18:51,026 --> 00:18:51,961
Challenge.

00:18:52,027 --> 00:18:54,930
Challenge over here.

00:18:54,997 --> 00:18:57,166
WOMAN:
Illegal word-- that's
a minute penalty.

00:18:57,232 --> 00:19:00,035
MAN:
Time's up.
Game over, baby.

00:19:00,102 --> 00:19:03,839
Gaboons? Like I'm really
not going to challenge that.

00:19:07,376 --> 00:19:08,377
Wilson Janek?

00:19:09,411 --> 00:19:11,380
Yeah.

00:19:11,447 --> 00:19:12,681
Want to try your luck?

00:19:12,748 --> 00:19:13,983
Step up, baby.

00:19:19,021 --> 00:19:20,489
And you are?

00:19:20,556 --> 00:19:23,225
Gil Grissom.
Nice to meet you.

00:19:23,292 --> 00:19:26,028
Nice to meet you,
Gil Grissom.

00:19:26,095 --> 00:19:27,229
So...

00:19:27,296 --> 00:19:28,797
what do you hear

00:19:28,864 --> 00:19:29,932
about Adam Brenner?

00:19:31,033 --> 00:19:32,835
Mr. 735?

00:19:32,901 --> 00:19:34,503
Heard he's dead.

00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:37,506
Well, he was alive last night
when he beat you.

00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,975
Gil...

00:19:40,042 --> 00:19:41,977
you think that trash talk's
going to break my focus?

00:19:42,044 --> 00:19:44,546
You must be new.

00:19:45,948 --> 00:19:46,915
Actually...

00:19:48,584 --> 00:19:50,219
I'm from the Las Vegas

00:19:50,286 --> 00:19:51,820
Crime Lab.

00:19:51,887 --> 00:19:54,390
I'm just here to
collect your DNA.

00:19:57,626 --> 00:19:59,628
You're a quick study.

00:20:01,163 --> 00:20:03,032
But if you think I killed Adam,

00:20:03,098 --> 00:20:06,268
why don't you go ask Uncle Sam
for my DNA?

00:20:06,335 --> 00:20:09,838
I served my country.
Gulf War Senior.

00:20:09,905 --> 00:20:12,875
Memorized word lists
for a sanity check.

00:20:12,942 --> 00:20:15,177
Some guys did ping pong;
I did this.

00:20:15,244 --> 00:20:17,579
I saw enough killing
over there.

00:20:17,646 --> 00:20:21,216
I'm a "Make words, not war"
kind of guy now.

00:20:26,255 --> 00:20:29,124
Word on the floor
is Adam Brenner really had

00:20:29,191 --> 00:20:30,559
your number, Craig.

00:20:30,626 --> 00:20:33,128
The universe ebbs
and flows.

00:20:33,195 --> 00:20:34,697
More ebb than flow
in your case.

00:20:34,763 --> 00:20:37,366
I guess you lost to Adam your
last three tournaments in a row?

00:20:37,433 --> 00:20:41,403
14 points...
times two is 28

00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:42,972
plus 10 bonus points
for full Logos.

00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:45,274
38 points.

00:20:47,209 --> 00:20:48,911
At least you're a good sport.

00:20:48,978 --> 00:20:52,047
Loss for one
is a win for another.

00:20:52,114 --> 00:20:53,816
<i>So what if I was</i>

00:20:53,882 --> 00:20:55,284
the last person
to play Adam?

00:20:55,351 --> 00:20:57,419
You were the last player
who saw him alive.

00:20:57,486 --> 00:20:58,420
What are you thinking,

00:20:58,487 --> 00:21:00,022
that with Adam
out of the tournament,

00:21:00,089 --> 00:21:02,625
I could abscond
with the big cash prize?

00:21:02,691 --> 00:21:04,593
( <i>chuckles</i> )
You tell me.

00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:07,162
Oh, first prize here is $2,000.

00:21:07,229 --> 00:21:08,897
Even if I win,
the remuneration

00:21:08,964 --> 00:21:10,466
barely covers my airfare,
accommodation

00:21:10,532 --> 00:21:11,900
and food.

00:21:11,967 --> 00:21:13,836
No, no, I don't play
for the money.

00:21:13,902 --> 00:21:15,537
You play for the glory.

00:21:17,273 --> 00:21:19,575
You ever attempt a <i>New York</i>
<i>Times</i> crossword, Captain?

00:21:19,642 --> 00:21:21,543
Nah, you probably
wouldn't make it
past Tuesday.

00:21:23,145 --> 00:21:25,848
I do Sunday... in pen.

00:21:25,914 --> 00:21:27,383
I can still spell this.

00:21:31,487 --> 00:21:34,590
GC/Mass Spec found no trace of
accelerant on the couch residue.

00:21:34,657 --> 00:21:35,658
Well, how can that be?

00:21:35,724 --> 00:21:37,293
It was an obvious
liquid pour pattern.

00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:38,894
Well, my dear, this is why

00:21:38,961 --> 00:21:41,964
you should never pick up the
couch left for curbside pickup.

00:21:42,031 --> 00:21:43,899
Polyurethane foam.

00:21:43,966 --> 00:21:48,003
Outlawed in 1988 due
to its highly incendiary nature.

00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,738
You light that crap on fire,
it heats up,

00:21:49,805 --> 00:21:51,407
creates a burning pool
of liquid,

00:21:51,473 --> 00:21:53,409
and acts as its own accelerant.

00:21:58,414 --> 00:22:00,282
Disaster waiting to happen.

00:22:00,349 --> 00:22:01,417
All it needed was a spark.

00:22:05,754 --> 00:22:07,389
We've got no accelerant.

00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:10,693
We've got no match.

00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:11,961
We have no idea

00:22:12,027 --> 00:22:14,430
what started this fire.

00:22:20,469 --> 00:22:22,004
Maybe this will help.

00:22:22,071 --> 00:22:26,375
It kind of smells
like a menthol.

00:22:27,409 --> 00:22:30,412
Hmm, looks like a 100.

00:22:30,479 --> 00:22:33,515
Longer the cigarette,
longer the filter.

00:22:33,582 --> 00:22:35,284
Cigarettes are a terrible way
to commit arson.

00:22:35,351 --> 00:22:36,552
Unreliable. They take too long.

00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,189
Possible DNA
trace, but...

00:22:40,255 --> 00:22:42,725
it just doesn't make any sense.

00:22:42,791 --> 00:22:45,060

if the fire was unintentional.

Well, don't look at me.

00:23:13,622 --> 00:23:15,591
I don't think so.

00:23:15,658 --> 00:23:17,927
Well, we found
a cigarette filter

00:23:17,993 --> 00:23:19,795

for nicotine.

00:23:27,603 --> 00:23:29,905
My house burned down,

00:23:29,972 --> 00:23:32,274
and my daughter is dead.

00:23:32,341 --> 00:23:34,510
And you're asking me
to pee into a cup?

00:23:37,346 --> 00:23:40,015

It's a mix of PVC resin

When heated together,

00:25:06,312 --> 00:25:08,047

00:25:31,837 --> 00:25:33,105
Look, just 'cause I was there

00:25:33,172 --> 00:25:34,740
doesn't mean
I killed Adam Brenner.

00:25:34,807 --> 00:25:37,043
Put your hands on the table.

that's seven
years bad luck.

00:25:44,583 --> 00:25:46,886
More like seven to ten.

00:25:46,953 --> 00:25:49,055
Yeah, I'm not very proud
of that.

00:25:49,121 --> 00:25:50,523

00:25:50,589 --> 00:25:51,857
I'm ebullient, you know.

I-I feel the wins

00:25:53,793 --> 00:25:56,028
The other night, I lost
to a Division Two blue-hair.

00:25:56,095 --> 00:25:57,430
But it's not my fault.

00:25:57,496 --> 00:25:59,899

00:26:02,335 --> 00:26:03,869
You know, yap, yap,
yap-yapping.

00:26:03,936 --> 00:26:05,705
So when I was
at the Southern Regionals

00:26:05,771 --> 00:26:06,872
in Dallas last year,

00:26:06,939 --> 00:26:08,140
I went to the
book depository.

00:26:08,207 --> 00:26:09,408
Have you ever
been there?

00:26:09,475 --> 00:26:11,410
Zip it, lady. I'm trying
to make a play here.

00:26:11,477 --> 00:26:14,413
I never should have lost
that one.

00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,982
What, are you an idiot?

00:26:16,048 --> 00:26:17,183
What, are you stupid?

00:26:17,249 --> 00:26:18,384
You're so stupid!

00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:20,419
What about Adam Brenner?

00:26:20,486 --> 00:26:22,455
No, he wasn't there.

00:26:22,521 --> 00:26:25,057
But you lost to him, too.

00:26:25,124 --> 00:26:26,592
BRASS:
Maybe you took

00:26:26,659 --> 00:26:28,427
that loss even harder.

00:26:28,494 --> 00:26:29,595
Adam?

00:26:29,662 --> 00:26:30,796
No way.

00:26:30,863 --> 00:26:32,598
He's ranked, what, 1,890?

00:26:32,665 --> 00:26:34,567
It's like getting art lessons
from Picasso.

00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:36,602
I was honored to even be sitting

00:26:36,669 --> 00:26:38,671
at the same table
with him.

00:27:21,113 --> 00:27:25,217
Ma'am, earlier you provided us
with a urine sample.

00:27:25,284 --> 00:27:28,487
We found traces
of nicotine in yours.

00:27:28,554 --> 00:27:30,556
That's odd
because I don't smoke.

00:27:30,623 --> 00:27:32,458
Really?

00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:34,827
Would you mind
opening your purse for me?

00:27:40,433 --> 00:27:41,534
You know what?

00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,069
I do too smoke cigarettes.

Attention Deficit Disorder?

00:27:50,109 --> 00:27:52,078
Sabrina?

00:27:52,144 --> 00:27:54,013
No.

00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,649
That girl had the focus
like you can't believe.

00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:58,985
Well, we found Ritalin
in her system,

00:27:59,051 --> 00:28:00,920
and as I'm sure you're aware,

00:28:00,987 --> 00:28:03,422
Ritalin is used
to treat kids with ADD,

00:28:03,489 --> 00:28:06,492
but acts as a stimulant
in older kids and adults.

00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,928
Teens use it as an upper.

00:28:08,995 --> 00:28:12,098
So, Sabrina was taking drugs?

00:28:12,164 --> 00:28:15,501
As were you.

00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:17,703
Valium.

00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:19,238
Fair enough.

00:28:19,305 --> 00:28:21,774
You know,

00:28:21,841 --> 00:28:23,342
Sabrina used to scream at me,

00:28:23,409 --> 00:28:25,077
"I can't wait
till I'm old enough

00:28:25,144 --> 00:28:26,312
to move out of here."

00:28:26,379 --> 00:28:28,614
And I would scream back,
"Yeah, me either."

00:28:31,684 --> 00:28:34,520
What kind of mother says that
to her kid?

00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:36,756
One with a teenage daughter.

00:28:36,822 --> 00:28:38,624
You know what
I pictured

00:28:38,691 --> 00:28:40,993
for this part of my life?

00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:43,462
S... Saturday night,

00:28:43,529 --> 00:28:45,464
leave the kids with Grandma,

00:28:45,531 --> 00:28:47,533
date night with my husband.

00:28:49,201 --> 00:28:51,170
Instead, I'm stuck home alone

00:28:51,237 --> 00:28:55,207
with two kids
and a 70-year-old infant.

00:28:55,274 --> 00:28:58,010
Mrs. Abernathy...

00:28:58,077 --> 00:29:01,981
are you covering
for your mother?

00:29:03,749 --> 00:29:05,851
Part of me wants to say yes,

00:29:05,918 --> 00:29:07,954
please just

00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,155
take her away.

00:29:09,221 --> 00:29:10,957
Let her be the
state's problem.

00:29:11,023 --> 00:29:12,658
You know,
she leaves the stove on,

00:29:12,725 --> 00:29:14,360
and she leaves
the water running.

00:29:14,427 --> 00:29:18,030
I come home, and I find
little burn marks in things.

00:29:21,734 --> 00:29:23,669
But I was with her
the whole night.

00:29:23,736 --> 00:29:25,671
I never saw her smoke.

00:29:25,738 --> 00:29:26,973
Maybe

00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,140
after you went to bed,

00:29:28,207 --> 00:29:29,709
she came out
into the living room.

00:29:37,316 --> 00:29:38,985
I doubt it.

00:29:39,051 --> 00:29:40,586
But it's a possibility?

00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:41,821
No.

00:29:41,887 --> 00:29:43,456
It isn't.

you can go ahead and judge me,

00:29:46,692 --> 00:29:48,694
but after my mother falls asleep
at night,

00:29:48,761 --> 00:29:50,930
I lock her in her room.

00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:57,837
Any luck?

00:29:57,903 --> 00:29:59,338
Yeah, the bad kind.

00:29:59,405 --> 00:30:01,507
My burn scenarios don't match up
with your data.

00:30:01,574 --> 00:30:03,142
Did you try
different variables?

00:30:03,209 --> 00:30:05,444
Yeah. Open windows, uh,

their magnetic properties, yeah?

Mm-hmm.

Frustration shows
you still care.

00:33:27,771 --> 00:33:30,207
And the son, Sam?

00:33:30,274 --> 00:33:31,408
I don't think so.

00:33:31,475 --> 00:33:33,644
"Bitch."
It's such a teenage girl word.

00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:37,948
That brings us back to Sabrina.

00:33:38,015 --> 00:33:39,717
Well, she did think

00:33:39,783 --> 00:33:41,886
the baseball team
had it in for her.

00:33:41,952 --> 00:33:44,121
Her family life
was no picnic.

00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:46,223
What are you saying,
she's on a kamikaze mission?

00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:48,492
Trying to take the whole family
down with her?

00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:54,031
I might be willing to buy that,
but how do we prove it?

00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,296
♪ ♪

00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,978
SIDLE:
Adam Brenner
was a meticulous note-taker.

00:34:41,045 --> 00:34:44,114
He documented every turn of
every game he ever played.

00:34:44,181 --> 00:34:48,152
How many words used the letters
we found in Adam's body?

00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:50,888
None, actually, at least none
with that exact combination.

00:34:50,955 --> 00:34:52,389
But here's the weird part.

00:34:52,456 --> 00:34:54,258
One of the games
didn't add up.

00:34:55,292 --> 00:34:57,294
When Adam played Craig,

00:34:57,361 --> 00:35:00,364
he had 60 points written down
that I couldn't account for.

00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,199
And on that same page
of his notebook,

00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:04,335
I noticed that something

00:35:04,401 --> 00:35:05,736
had been erased.

00:35:05,803 --> 00:35:09,039
So I ran it through ESDA.

00:35:09,106 --> 00:35:10,474
Adam played "Exvin."

00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:12,910
Everything but the "S,"
60 points.

00:35:12,977 --> 00:35:14,745
What's an "Exvin"?

00:35:14,812 --> 00:35:16,780
You know,
I was kind of hoping you'd know.

00:35:16,847 --> 00:35:17,848
It's not in the <i>OED.</i>

00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:22,286
Well, according to the rules,

00:35:22,353 --> 00:35:26,423
if you play a bluff
and your opponent challenges,

00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:28,392
you have to take the tiles back,
you lose a turn

00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:31,262
and a minute
off your game clock. No points.

00:35:31,328 --> 00:35:34,765
Right,
and later in that same game,

00:35:34,832 --> 00:35:36,834
Craig played an "X."

00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:38,836
"Loxodrome."

00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:41,372
Now there's only one "X"
per game.

00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,575
How did he get it?

00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:48,979
What are you
looking for?

00:35:49,046 --> 00:35:50,848
A six-letter word.

00:35:59,123 --> 00:36:01,325
P-I-S-T-O-L?

00:36:01,392 --> 00:36:03,527
It's not the word
we were looking for,

00:36:03,594 --> 00:36:05,196
but it's interesting.

00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:13,170
With blood on it.

00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:14,839
It's a replica.

00:36:14,905 --> 00:36:17,041
I belong to a Communist club.

00:36:17,107 --> 00:36:18,709
We collect replicas

00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:20,611
from the fall of
the Soviet Union.

00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:23,948
And I found that Tokarev
downtown at a pawn shop.

00:36:24,014 --> 00:36:28,886
Hmm. A fake gun for a fake word?

00:36:36,093 --> 00:36:38,262
Exvin?

00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:41,232
A wine aficionado
who no longer drinks.

00:36:41,298 --> 00:36:42,299
Exvin.

00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:48,672
Exvins.

00:36:50,808 --> 00:36:54,345
Challenge!

00:36:57,248 --> 00:37:01,852
There are six letters missing
from your game box.

00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:03,988
E-X-V

00:37:04,054 --> 00:37:06,423
I-N-S.

00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:08,692
You made Adam eat his word.

00:37:10,961 --> 00:37:12,696
Yeah, huh?

00:37:12,763 --> 00:37:13,998
You think
you're so clever?

00:37:14,064 --> 00:37:17,234
I'll let you have
some Exvins for dinner.

00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:18,502
Here.

00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:21,405
Huh?

00:37:21,472 --> 00:37:22,506
( <i>groans</i> )

00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:23,841
( <i>choking</i> )

00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,876
I just wanted to make it

00:37:25,943 --> 00:37:28,245
as hard for him to swallow
as it was for me.

00:37:28,312 --> 00:37:30,247
Karmic retribution.

00:37:30,314 --> 00:37:32,817
Did you do anything to help him
after he started choking?

00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:35,686
No. I thought
it was another fake-out.

00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,221
How about after he fell down

00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:39,223
on the floor
and stopped breathing?

00:37:42,326 --> 00:37:44,395
Out of words?

00:37:46,564 --> 00:37:49,066
This is old school
hydrocarbon detection.

00:37:49,133 --> 00:37:50,801
Oh, yeah.

00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:53,771
WILLOWS:
Chafing dish fuel
is alcohol-based,

00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:57,208
but water would have washed away
any trace.

00:37:57,274 --> 00:37:58,442
Let's just hope

00:37:58,509 --> 00:38:02,046
that whomever wrote it
touched something else.

00:38:02,112 --> 00:38:06,183
Well, it's the only shot
we've got, I guess.

00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:07,384
WILLOWS:
Hmm.

00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:09,386
Take a look at this.

00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:10,521
Well, that's good shooting.

00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:29,807
Oh.

00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:36,080
Hit the jackpot.

00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:41,385
I've got some smudges
over here, too.

00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:53,063
Mom was locking the wrong door.

00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:56,534
They're going

00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,370
to ask you some questions
about the fire at our house.

00:38:59,436 --> 00:39:01,605
And you'd better

00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:03,774
start talking, mister.

00:39:07,978 --> 00:39:09,580
Mrs. Abernathy,

00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:11,315
would you come with me, please?

00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:36,941
Hey, Sam.

00:39:39,743 --> 00:39:41,879
You okay?

00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:46,517
So tell me,

00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:48,018
what kind of things you like

00:39:48,085 --> 00:39:50,554
to do on the weekends?

00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:53,691
Watch TV, hang out,

00:39:53,757 --> 00:39:55,826
play.

00:39:59,964 --> 00:40:02,099
Like to play with matches?

00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:04,401
Sometimes.

00:40:04,468 --> 00:40:06,070
Why is that?

00:40:06,137 --> 00:40:08,272
Fire is cool.

00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:09,974
Yeah.

00:40:26,423 --> 00:40:28,526
You ever have trouble
sleeping at night?

00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:31,295
Only when I got woken up.

00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:34,632
Is that what happened
Saturday?

00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:38,669
( <i>knocking</i> )

00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:40,638
I lost my key. Let me in.

00:40:41,672 --> 00:40:44,675
Thanks, dude.

00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:56,987
Couldn't go back to bed?

00:40:57,054 --> 00:40:59,523
I got a little bit hungry.

00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:14,872
What'd you find?

00:41:14,939 --> 00:41:16,707
Purple jelly.

00:41:16,774 --> 00:41:19,210
Purple jelly?

00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:23,080
Did you eat it?

00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:24,582
No.

00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:28,052
Mom uses it for the chocolate
pot on our birthdays.

00:41:28,118 --> 00:41:30,187
That sounds like fun.

00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:31,922
Yeah...

00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:35,759
except stupid Grandma
isn't allowed to have chocolate,

00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:37,695
so we couldn't do it this year.

00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:41,065
Oh... that must've
made you mad.

00:41:41,132 --> 00:41:44,869
Ever since Grandma moved in,
we can't do anything fun.

00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:48,873
So, what happened next?

00:41:48,939 --> 00:41:52,276
I played for a while.

00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:16,600
Then what?

00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:20,971
I went to bed... and then
the firemen came and rescued us.

00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:22,740
You like when the firemen come?

00:42:22,807 --> 00:42:23,974
Yeah.

00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,409
They're so nice.

00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:28,078
They talked to me and showed me
all their cool stuff.

00:42:28,145 --> 00:42:31,782
This one named George--
he said maybe someday I can meet

00:42:31,849 --> 00:42:34,318
his dog.

00:42:36,987 --> 00:42:38,322
You know, Sam...

00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:42,326
that word that you wrote
on the floor...

00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,929
You know, that's
a really bad word.

00:42:44,995 --> 00:42:47,998
I hear it all the time.

00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:53,437
My grandma says it.

00:42:58,342 --> 00:43:00,010
My mom says it.

00:43:03,481 --> 00:43:06,617
And my sister says it.

00:43:09,286 --> 00:43:12,490
Well... she used to say it.
