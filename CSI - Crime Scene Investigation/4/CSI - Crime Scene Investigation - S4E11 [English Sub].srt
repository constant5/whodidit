00:00:01,166 --> 00:00:02,267
( <i>thunder crashes</i> )

00:00:05,125 --> 00:00:07,193
I saw you with him.
I know you're lying.

00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:09,396
<i>You've got it all wrong.</i>
<i>I'm telling you. Nothing happened.</i>

00:00:10,463 --> 00:00:11,731
Nobody cheats on me.

00:00:11,798 --> 00:00:12,932
( <i>chokes</i> )

00:00:16,703 --> 00:00:18,905
WOMAN:
<i>His fingerprints were</i>
<i>all over that belt.</i>

00:00:18,972 --> 00:00:20,373
That's the only way
it could have happened.

00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,574
I'm with Lizette, all right?

00:00:21,641 --> 00:00:22,909
We heard from the DA.

00:00:22,976 --> 00:00:25,478
They called the cops last week
on a domestic disturbance.

00:00:25,545 --> 00:00:26,980
Kimble was just getting
warmed up. Believe me.

00:00:27,047 --> 00:00:28,148
I know the type.

00:00:28,214 --> 00:00:29,382
Husband was a casino host.

00:00:29,449 --> 00:00:31,484
Just happens to come home
in the middle of a shift?

00:00:31,551 --> 00:00:32,352
Come on.

00:00:32,419 --> 00:00:33,353
Oh, look, we've really

00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:34,788
talked this thing
to death, haven't we?

00:00:34,854 --> 00:00:38,325
Chris, can we please put this
to another vote?

00:00:51,404 --> 00:00:54,107
The burden of proof is beyond

00:00:54,174 --> 00:00:55,108
a reasonable doubt.

00:00:55,175 --> 00:00:56,743
We don't have that.

00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:57,911
There was somebody else
in the house that day.

00:00:57,978 --> 00:00:59,145
The cable guy.

00:01:02,182 --> 00:01:04,684
Cable guy's got priors.
He skipped town.

00:01:04,751 --> 00:01:06,286
You're still on the cable guy
theory?

00:01:06,353 --> 00:01:08,188
His fingerprints
weren't even on the belt.

00:01:08,254 --> 00:01:09,289
He could have worn gloves.

00:01:09,356 --> 00:01:11,858
I can't take this
anymore!

00:01:11,925 --> 00:01:15,428
Who keeps shutting
this damn window?

00:01:15,495 --> 00:01:17,631
Lunch will be here soon.
Let's take a break.

00:01:21,134 --> 00:01:24,471
This guy is
driving me nuts.

00:01:24,537 --> 00:01:26,339
We've got to get
Chris Gibbons replaced.

00:01:26,406 --> 00:01:28,274
Oh, I pointed him
in the right direction,

00:01:28,341 --> 00:01:29,275
but he didn't snap.

00:01:29,342 --> 00:01:32,412
I'd kill for a candy bar
right now.

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,682
Hey, people.
Your lunch is getting cold.

00:01:40,286 --> 00:01:42,856
( <i>chattering</i> )

00:01:54,434 --> 00:01:56,903
Chris Gibbons,
UNLV grad student.

00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:58,571
The jury's been sequestered
two and a half weeks

00:01:58,638 --> 00:01:59,939
on a murder trial.

00:02:00,006 --> 00:02:04,778
Twelve strangers...
stuck in a room

00:02:04,844 --> 00:02:06,146
with no exit.

00:02:06,212 --> 00:02:10,784
It's like Sartre said:

My early opinion?
Blunt force.

00:03:03,214 --> 00:03:07,218
He's got a, uh,
medical alert bracelet.

00:03:07,285 --> 00:03:09,153
Allergy to penicillin.

00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:14,259
Well... we got 11
potential suspects.

00:03:19,731 --> 00:03:22,000
Do you have one with blond hair?

00:03:22,066 --> 00:03:23,234
Yeah. There's one I know of.

00:03:23,301 --> 00:03:26,271
Um, Miss Davis--
she's a stripper

00:03:26,337 --> 00:03:28,206
at The Shimmer.

00:03:34,546 --> 00:03:38,349
There's no tag cells,
and she's not a natural blonde,

00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:39,584
and it looks
synthetic.

00:03:39,651 --> 00:03:41,119
Hey, this is Vegas, baby.

00:03:44,088 --> 00:03:49,894
"Guilty," "guilty"...
"not guilty."

00:03:49,961 --> 00:03:53,965
11 "guilty," one "not guilty."

00:03:55,133 --> 00:03:56,534
Now that's motive.

00:03:56,601 --> 00:03:59,003
( <i>chattering</i> )

00:04:01,206 --> 00:04:03,842
Excuse me.
May I have your...?

00:04:03,908 --> 00:04:05,577
Excuse me.

00:04:05,643 --> 00:04:07,245
May I have your attention,
please?

00:04:08,913 --> 00:04:10,181
Thank you.

00:04:10,248 --> 00:04:12,517
I'm Catherine Willows.
I'm from the Crime Lab.

00:04:12,584 --> 00:04:14,152
So it's a mistrial, right?

00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:15,186
Can we go home?

00:04:15,253 --> 00:04:17,422
No. I'm sorry.

00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:18,823
No one is
going anywhere.

00:04:20,992 --> 00:04:22,093
Ms. Davis.

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,862
I'll start with you.

00:04:23,928 --> 00:04:24,996
Will you follow me, please?

00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,936
( <i>chattering</i> )

00:04:32,003 --> 00:04:34,472
Miss Davis, we found
a synthetic blond hair

00:04:34,539 --> 00:04:35,740
on the victim's body.

00:04:35,807 --> 00:04:37,475
Care to explain?

00:04:37,542 --> 00:04:38,910
Girl to girl.

00:04:38,977 --> 00:04:40,245
I'm a dancer.

00:04:40,311 --> 00:04:43,214
I came off the pole.
I teased him a little bit.

00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:46,317
I need a release,

00:04:46,384 --> 00:04:50,121
so why don't you get us
out of here, and I'll...

00:04:50,188 --> 00:04:53,091
( <i>inaudible dialogue</i> )

00:04:53,157 --> 00:04:55,026
Did he take you up
on your offer?

00:04:55,093 --> 00:04:58,363
Well, if you ask me,
arguing was his turn-on.

00:04:58,429 --> 00:04:59,764
Lucky for you.

00:04:59,831 --> 00:05:03,334
Attempting to influence
is a Category D felony.

00:05:03,401 --> 00:05:06,037
It's up to four years in prison
and a $5,000 fine.

00:05:06,104 --> 00:05:08,306
Am I under arrest?

00:05:10,341 --> 00:05:12,310
Woman to woman?

00:05:13,178 --> 00:05:15,613
The pole is there for a reason.

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,848
It's what you hang on to

00:05:16,915 --> 00:05:20,218
so the creeps don't pull you
out of there.

00:05:20,285 --> 00:05:21,452
Smarten up.

00:05:30,361 --> 00:05:31,362
Thanks, man.

00:05:31,429 --> 00:05:32,564
Stokes.

00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:33,731
Detective.

00:05:33,798 --> 00:05:34,766
Hey.
Hey.

00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:35,934
You've got a minute?

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,935
Yeah. Sure, what's up?

00:05:37,001 --> 00:05:38,369
Four years ago,
you and Grissom

00:05:38,436 --> 00:05:40,505
worked a missing persons
out in Moapa Valley?

00:05:40,572 --> 00:05:43,308
She lived on a farm
with her husband?

00:05:43,374 --> 00:05:46,744
Wow. Um...
Yeah, I remember.

00:05:46,811 --> 00:05:48,112
Uh-uh, Rita?

00:05:48,179 --> 00:05:49,380
Rita Westonson.

00:05:49,447 --> 00:05:52,150
Found nothing suspicious.
Nothing criminal.

00:05:52,217 --> 00:05:53,785
Figured she wanted
to skip town, disappear.

00:05:53,852 --> 00:05:55,620
Rita's sister
is in interrogation.

00:05:55,687 --> 00:05:57,722
She's claiming
Rita was murdered.

00:05:57,789 --> 00:06:01,793
Faye, it's been four years
since your sister went missing.

00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,995
Now, CSI conducted
a full investigation--

00:06:04,062 --> 00:06:07,165
found nothing suspicious,
nothing criminal.

00:06:07,232 --> 00:06:09,200
Why are you coming forward now?

00:06:09,267 --> 00:06:13,304
I lied to you back then, and I
live with the guilt every day.

00:06:13,371 --> 00:06:14,439
Miss Minden?

00:06:14,506 --> 00:06:17,108
It's my duty to advise you
of your right to counsel.

00:06:17,175 --> 00:06:18,810
I don't want
an attorney.

00:06:18,877 --> 00:06:20,945
I admit I withheld
information.

00:06:21,012 --> 00:06:22,280
That's why I'm here.

00:06:22,347 --> 00:06:24,849
And if I have to go to jail,
so be it.

00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:26,885
I just want to do right
by my sister.

00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:33,424
Okay. Let's start
from the beginning.

00:06:33,491 --> 00:06:35,593
Your sister disappeared
over a weekend...

00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,662
Rita didn't disappear.

00:06:37,729 --> 00:06:40,165
Her business trip
to Fresno got cut short,

00:06:40,231 --> 00:06:41,833
and she came home early.

00:06:44,002 --> 00:06:47,906
<i>Found Aaron, her husband,</i>
<i>in the barn with another</i>
<i>woman.</i>

00:06:47,972 --> 00:06:50,441
Rita freaked out
and started screaming

00:06:50,508 --> 00:06:53,011
and saying
she was going to leave him.

00:06:53,077 --> 00:06:54,846
Aaron saw red and lost it.

00:06:54,913 --> 00:06:56,681
( <i>blows landing</i> )

00:06:56,748 --> 00:06:59,417
( <i>body thuds</i> )

00:06:59,484 --> 00:07:02,053
Now if memory serves,
her husband had an alibi?

00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:06,124
Yeah. He was camping in Red Rock
with Harris Mathey.

00:07:06,191 --> 00:07:08,393
That's his business partner,
right?

00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:09,928
Yeah, but Harris owed Aaron
a lot of money.

00:07:09,994 --> 00:07:11,296
He would have said anything.

00:07:11,362 --> 00:07:12,997
If that's true,
Mr. Mathey is guilty

00:07:13,064 --> 00:07:14,365
of conspiracy after the fact.

00:07:14,432 --> 00:07:18,069
He died last month.

00:07:18,136 --> 00:07:20,805
And he's the only one who knew,
besides me.

00:07:20,872 --> 00:07:24,075
Do you know what Aaron did
with Rita's body?

00:07:38,156 --> 00:07:42,894
He drove her out to the river,
about a half mile from his farm,

00:07:42,961 --> 00:07:45,363
and, um, set her on fire.

00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,999
She burned all night,
and then in the morning,

00:07:48,066 --> 00:07:49,834
he dumped her ashes
in the water.

00:07:54,138 --> 00:07:55,640
Miss Minden...

00:07:55,707 --> 00:07:57,408
how did you come across

00:07:57,475 --> 00:07:59,310
this information?

00:08:07,185 --> 00:08:09,187
You were the other woman.

00:08:29,174 --> 00:08:30,375
Hey, Sara.

00:08:30,441 --> 00:08:33,411
Any jurors have blood
on their hands?

00:08:33,478 --> 00:08:35,980
WILLOWS:
Mr. Jervis.

00:08:36,047 --> 00:08:38,416
Why are your fingers bloodied?

00:08:38,483 --> 00:08:40,318
You ever been
on a jury before?

00:08:40,385 --> 00:08:43,321
How many grad students does it
take to screw in a lightbulb?

00:08:43,388 --> 00:08:45,990
I can't take this anymore!

00:08:48,526 --> 00:08:51,229
It's the worst experience
of my life.

00:08:51,296 --> 00:08:54,265
Would you hold your hands
up for me, please?

00:08:54,332 --> 00:08:56,000
The case was a lock anyway.

00:08:56,067 --> 00:08:57,135
I mean, Kimble obviously had...

00:08:57,202 --> 00:08:58,269
Mr. Jervis.

00:08:58,336 --> 00:08:59,704
I need to remind you
that you're still

00:08:59,771 --> 00:09:01,639
under judge's orders
not to discuss the case.

00:09:01,706 --> 00:09:05,310
That's great. This guy's dead,
and I still can't go home?

00:09:05,376 --> 00:09:07,045
Let me tell you
something.

00:09:07,111 --> 00:09:09,981
From the very beginning,
day one

00:09:10,048 --> 00:09:12,250
day after day,

00:09:12,317 --> 00:09:13,685
this guy is
the only holdout.

00:09:13,751 --> 00:09:15,420
Do you want to know
what my boss calls me?

00:09:15,486 --> 00:09:17,755
Mr. Replaceable.

00:09:17,822 --> 00:09:21,025
<i>I had to get back to work.</i>

00:09:21,092 --> 00:09:22,193
( <i>yelling</i> )

00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,862
I lost my temper.

00:09:23,928 --> 00:09:25,730
You sure it's lost?

00:09:39,777 --> 00:09:41,279
Homicide just called.

00:09:41,346 --> 00:09:44,282
They're reopening
the Rita Westonson case

00:09:44,349 --> 00:09:47,285
based on new information
from the eyewitness?

00:09:47,352 --> 00:09:48,686
File's thinner
than I remembered.

00:09:48,753 --> 00:09:50,755
You think we missed something?

00:09:50,822 --> 00:09:52,790
We figured she skipped town,
wanting to disappear.

00:09:52,857 --> 00:09:54,626
At the time, that was
a reasonable conclusion

00:09:54,692 --> 00:09:55,960
based on the evidence.

00:09:56,027 --> 00:09:57,996
Does the witness
seem credible to you?

00:09:58,062 --> 00:10:00,064
Well, if she's lying,
she's obstructing justice

00:10:00,131 --> 00:10:01,966
and wasting my time, but
if she's telling the truth,

00:10:02,033 --> 00:10:03,902
we may have closed
the investigation early.

00:10:03,968 --> 00:10:07,205
At the time, you were
a Level Two, I believe.

00:10:07,272 --> 00:10:10,909
So closing the case
would have been my decision.

00:10:10,975 --> 00:10:12,310
Yeah, it would have.

00:10:12,377 --> 00:10:16,247
I'm checking out her story.
I'll see if it holds up.

00:10:16,314 --> 00:10:17,248
Let me know.

00:10:17,315 --> 00:10:18,583
Mm-hmm.

00:10:20,518 --> 00:10:22,954

00:22:28,451 --> 00:22:30,186
at the burn site,
registered 18%.

00:22:30,252 --> 00:22:32,121
Now anything over 10%
is indicative

00:22:32,188 --> 00:22:34,857
of full saturation over
the last couple of years.

00:22:34,924 --> 00:22:38,160
The river might have washed away
all trace of hydrocarbons.

00:22:38,227 --> 00:22:40,596
Exactly, but before it washed
away, some of the hydrocarbons

00:22:40,663 --> 00:22:41,964
could have
seeped into the ground

00:22:42,031 --> 00:22:43,099
into the tree's
roots.

00:22:43,165 --> 00:22:44,934
Roots carry nutrients
to the tree.

00:22:45,001 --> 00:22:48,137
Some of the hydrocarbons
could have hitched a ride.

00:22:48,204 --> 00:22:52,608
Oaks don't bear fruit,
but this one bears witness.

00:22:52,675 --> 00:22:54,877
Every year,
a branch grows a new ring

00:22:54,944 --> 00:22:57,613
composed of alike,
dark band.

00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,116
Counting from the outside in,
going back four years--

00:23:00,182 --> 00:23:02,485
one, two, three,
four...

00:23:02,551 --> 00:23:03,919
The ring from

00:23:03,986 --> 00:23:06,922
four years ago is thinner
and distorted.

00:23:06,989 --> 00:23:08,391
Yeah, the same
distortion is present

00:23:08,457 --> 00:23:09,659
in ring four of every branch.

00:23:09,725 --> 00:23:13,529
And distortion could mean
evidence of a toxic event.

00:23:13,596 --> 00:23:16,299
I'm thinking the burning
of gasoline under the tree.

00:23:17,533 --> 00:23:18,868
How are you going to prove it?

00:23:18,935 --> 00:23:20,703
Saw dust.

00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,549
( <i>buzzing</i> )

00:23:47,096 --> 00:23:50,733
Nick, I think you're
going to like this.

00:23:52,568 --> 00:23:54,804
STOKES:
Affirmative for hydrocarbons.

00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:55,838
Now we're talking.

00:23:55,905 --> 00:23:58,274
Nick, no offense, but
proving the boss wrong

00:23:58,341 --> 00:24:00,910
is not the quickest path
to career advancement.

00:24:00,977 --> 00:24:03,379
The trial lasted four weeks.

00:24:03,446 --> 00:24:05,047
They've been locked
in deliberations

00:24:05,114 --> 00:24:06,048
for two and a half.

00:24:06,115 --> 00:24:07,049
Sequestered?

00:24:07,116 --> 00:24:08,584
Well, it's
a high-profile case.

00:24:08,651 --> 00:24:11,220
Judge Slater limited contact,
censored newspapers,

00:24:11,287 --> 00:24:13,823
no television, shuttle
between here and their hotel.

00:24:13,889 --> 00:24:15,324
That's a juror's life.

00:24:15,391 --> 00:24:17,326
What about the food,
how does that work?

00:24:17,393 --> 00:24:19,695
This case, uh,
jurors had breakfast

00:24:19,762 --> 00:24:20,963
and dinner at the hotel.

00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:23,532
Lunch, I brought in a menu,
they order...

00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:25,001
Gee, let me guess.

00:24:25,067 --> 00:24:26,068
For the 17th day

00:24:26,135 --> 00:24:28,070
in a row,
you're going to order chili.

00:24:28,137 --> 00:24:30,006
Oh, now you're criticizing
my food choices.

00:24:30,072 --> 00:24:32,108
Chris Gibbons had chili
the day he died.

00:24:32,174 --> 00:24:33,843
Yeah, the guy had
food allergies.

00:24:33,909 --> 00:24:35,778
We had one place
we ordered from.

00:24:35,845 --> 00:24:37,179
He had chili every day.

00:24:37,246 --> 00:24:39,615
Did jurors have access
to these vending machines?

00:24:39,682 --> 00:24:41,851
Uh, yeah,
that's why they're here.

00:24:41,917 --> 00:24:42,918
It's their nickel.

00:24:42,985 --> 00:24:44,954
I mean, they got
to have something.

00:24:45,021 --> 00:24:46,055
They're away from
their families.

00:24:46,122 --> 00:24:48,891
I have all
their cell phone...

00:24:48,958 --> 00:24:50,793
Well, almost all of them.

00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:53,062
Caught a guy
double packing.

00:24:53,129 --> 00:24:55,865
( <i>beeping</i> )

00:24:55,932 --> 00:24:59,402
Can't anybody make a battery
that lasts more than

00:24:59,468 --> 00:25:00,937
a couple of hours?

00:25:02,471 --> 00:25:04,407
Hey, I confiscated his primary

00:25:04,473 --> 00:25:06,142
at the beginning
of deliberations,

00:25:06,208 --> 00:25:07,944
but I don't do cavity searches.

00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:09,445
( <i>chuckling</i> )

00:25:09,512 --> 00:25:11,213
How do you burn out
your cell phone battery

00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,982
when you're not allowed
to use your phone?

00:25:13,049 --> 00:25:15,484
They don't make cell
phones like they used to.

00:25:15,551 --> 00:25:16,485
That's true,
actually.

00:25:16,552 --> 00:25:17,520
Now they make
them better.

00:25:17,586 --> 00:25:19,088
Did you know
that this one takes pictures?

00:25:19,155 --> 00:25:20,990
And having met
your fellow jurors,

00:25:21,057 --> 00:25:25,328
I think
you really captured them.

00:25:25,394 --> 00:25:27,163
Okay, let's start
with the misdemeanor.

00:25:27,229 --> 00:25:28,831
Cell phones
and cameras

00:25:28,898 --> 00:25:32,468
or cell phones <i>withcameras</i>
are prohibited in the jury
room.

00:25:32,535 --> 00:25:34,136
Somebody must have
told you that.

00:25:34,203 --> 00:25:35,871
See, after a while
they're family.

00:25:35,938 --> 00:25:38,941
I-I thought I could throw
a scrapbook together

00:25:39,008 --> 00:25:41,277
for everyone for
after the trial.

00:25:41,344 --> 00:25:43,279
Oh, and-and when where you
planning on handing that out?

00:25:43,346 --> 00:25:45,014
At Mr. Gibbons' funeral?

00:25:46,148 --> 00:25:47,750
I guess you would
consider the folks

00:25:47,817 --> 00:25:49,652
at the credit company
family, too.

00:25:49,719 --> 00:25:51,020
What?

00:25:51,087 --> 00:25:53,255
Yeah, according
to them, uh,

00:25:53,322 --> 00:25:55,758
you got a little bit of a
gambling jones, hmm?

00:25:55,825 --> 00:25:57,593
$25,000 in markers
all over town.

00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:00,162
So what's your game,
dice, cards, sports book?

00:26:00,229 --> 00:26:01,597
Or all of the above?

00:26:01,664 --> 00:26:03,299
Let's just say
it was a bad month.

00:26:03,366 --> 00:26:05,801
Not that bad.

00:26:05,868 --> 00:26:08,337
$30,000 deposit two days ago.

00:26:08,404 --> 00:26:10,640
All right, now
the questions get hard.

00:26:10,706 --> 00:26:12,942
I mean, you can't be
getting rich on jury duty,

00:26:13,009 --> 00:26:14,076
40 bucks a day.

00:26:16,345 --> 00:26:17,947
Or can you?

00:26:18,014 --> 00:26:22,852
Look, I'm self-employed,
which means I've been unemployed

00:26:22,918 --> 00:26:24,620
for the last
six and a half weeks.

00:26:24,687 --> 00:26:26,656
You just made $30,000.

00:26:26,722 --> 00:26:27,990
To deliver
the jury?

00:26:28,057 --> 00:26:30,326
No. My story.

00:26:30,393 --> 00:26:31,894
To a tabloid.

00:26:31,961 --> 00:26:33,496
Hey...

00:26:33,562 --> 00:26:34,563
it's one of
those cases--

00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:35,865
high-profile,

00:26:35,932 --> 00:26:37,566
jurors at each other's throats.

00:26:37,633 --> 00:26:39,602
( <i>indistinct shouting</i> )

00:26:43,172 --> 00:26:44,941
Why should the guy
that killed his wife

00:26:45,007 --> 00:26:46,609
be the only one to make a buck?

00:27:00,523 --> 00:27:01,691
Can I help you?

00:27:01,757 --> 00:27:02,925
I'm Detective Artan.

00:27:02,992 --> 00:27:04,827
This is Nick Stokes
from the Crime Lab.

00:27:04,894 --> 00:27:06,195
Terry Minden?

00:27:06,262 --> 00:27:07,496
Honey, who is it?

00:27:07,563 --> 00:27:08,864
It's the police.

00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,534
I remember you.

00:27:11,601 --> 00:27:13,369
You were here
about Rita.
Yeah.

00:27:13,436 --> 00:27:14,437
You found her.

00:27:14,503 --> 00:27:16,672
No, no, not exactly,

00:27:16,739 --> 00:27:18,374
but we have a
potential new lead.

00:27:18,441 --> 00:27:20,309
And we have a warrant.

00:27:22,078 --> 00:27:24,246
I'm an attorney.

00:27:24,313 --> 00:27:26,749
You want a sample
of gasoline?

00:27:26,816 --> 00:27:28,784
Uh, yes, ma'am--
eight ounces

00:27:28,851 --> 00:27:30,119
from Mr. Westonson's pump.

00:27:30,186 --> 00:27:30,886
Why?

00:27:30,953 --> 00:27:32,188
This is
about Rita.

00:27:32,254 --> 00:27:33,289
I have a right to know.

00:27:33,356 --> 00:27:35,691
Warrant was issued
by Judge Brenner.

00:27:35,758 --> 00:27:36,859
I'll make a call.

00:27:36,926 --> 00:27:37,893
Say hello for me.

00:27:39,495 --> 00:27:41,964
Four years ago,
you tore this place apart.

00:27:42,031 --> 00:27:43,065
That was okay with me.

00:27:43,132 --> 00:27:44,700
Now you come back
with no answers,

00:27:44,767 --> 00:27:46,402
and you're looking at me
with that same face.

00:27:46,469 --> 00:27:48,437
I'm going to tell you the
same thing I said before.

00:27:48,504 --> 00:27:51,540
I had nothing to do
with Rita's disappearance.

00:27:51,607 --> 00:27:53,376
Fuel pump's behind
the barn, right?

00:27:53,442 --> 00:27:56,479
Yeah. Help yourself.

00:28:06,022 --> 00:28:07,323
What are you looking at?

00:28:09,225 --> 00:28:11,193
I was standing right
here four years ago

00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,828
asking myself
the same question.

00:28:12,895 --> 00:28:16,832
You know,
Aaron Westonson's
right about one thing.

00:28:16,899 --> 00:28:17,967
Back then Grissom and I

00:28:18,034 --> 00:28:19,635
processed every
inch of that house

00:28:19,702 --> 00:28:22,371
and this barn and found
no signs of a struggle.

00:28:22,438 --> 00:28:24,540
Aaron versus Rita?
He's twice her size.

00:28:24,607 --> 00:28:26,676
Yeah, it would've been
over before it started.

00:28:33,215 --> 00:28:35,851
Okay, fill her up.

00:28:35,918 --> 00:28:37,353
I think
it's diesel.

00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,621
Why is it red?

00:28:38,688 --> 00:28:40,089
It's an EPA requirement.

00:28:40,156 --> 00:28:43,759
Farm's don't have to pay taxes
on fuel, so refineries,

00:28:43,826 --> 00:28:47,330
they mark their agricultural
diesel by dying it red.

00:29:27,903 --> 00:29:30,039
I'm getting married
in five days.

00:29:30,106 --> 00:29:32,608
Not if you can't explain
to me how your fingerprints

00:29:32,675 --> 00:29:34,543
ended up
on this peanut butter tube.

00:29:36,879 --> 00:29:38,481
We found it

00:29:38,547 --> 00:29:40,516
in the jury room.

00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:46,822
I just wanted to go home,
have my fittings.

00:29:46,889 --> 00:29:49,158
I spent my bridal shower
with 11 strangers.

00:29:49,225 --> 00:29:50,993
My sister filled in for me.

00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:53,529
I'll never get
to experience that.

00:29:53,596 --> 00:29:55,831
Mr. Gibbons
will never get to experience

00:29:55,898 --> 00:29:57,199
the rest of his life.

00:30:00,536 --> 00:30:04,674
We were on a break,
and the lunch order came.

00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:05,975
Hey.

00:30:06,042 --> 00:30:07,543
What did you order?

00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:10,079
Don't worry,
I'll pass it out.

00:30:22,191 --> 00:30:23,559
I got the peanut butter

00:30:23,626 --> 00:30:26,362
out of the vending machine
a couple days ago.

00:30:26,429 --> 00:30:31,434
I wanted to stuff it down
the guy's throat, but I didn't.

00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:35,571
So you decided to put
it in his chili instead?

00:30:40,776 --> 00:30:43,579
Great, food's here.

00:30:43,646 --> 00:30:45,247
I'm starving. Where's mine?

00:30:47,116 --> 00:30:49,819
<i>But at the last minute,</i>
<i>I couldn't do that.</i>

00:30:54,357 --> 00:30:54,991
Oh!

00:30:56,726 --> 00:30:58,094
Oh, I'm so sorry.

00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,662
No, that's okay,
I'll take yours.

00:30:59,729 --> 00:31:00,830
You can reorder.

00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:07,570
Then I cleaned up
and I walked out.

00:31:07,637 --> 00:31:09,438
You had to know
it was going to kill him.

00:31:09,505 --> 00:31:12,074
No, I didn't know
it was going to be lethal.

00:31:12,141 --> 00:31:14,644
When Bob was flicking
peanut shells at him,

00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:16,445
it's not like he choked up.

00:31:18,014 --> 00:31:18,981
I swear,

00:31:19,048 --> 00:31:20,916
I didn't know
it was going to kill him.

00:31:20,983 --> 00:31:23,185
I just thought that
it would get him replaced

00:31:23,252 --> 00:31:25,655
with one of the alternates
who would vote guilty.

00:31:25,721 --> 00:31:28,557
Well, Miss Newsome, you are
officially off of jury duty.

00:31:30,126 --> 00:31:32,928
I killed him.

00:31:32,995 --> 00:31:34,797
No, she didn't.

00:31:34,864 --> 00:31:37,099
Greg, she told Warrick she put
peanut butter in the chili.

00:31:37,166 --> 00:31:39,302
I don't care if Mr.
Peanut was taking a
bath in the vic's lunch.

00:31:39,368 --> 00:31:40,303
It's not what killed him.

00:31:40,369 --> 00:31:41,370
Be specific, Greg.

00:31:41,437 --> 00:31:42,872
I got the
detailed results

00:31:42,939 --> 00:31:44,373
back from the assay test.

00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,142
The level of immunoglobulin E

00:31:46,208 --> 00:31:48,911
was insufficient
to cause a lethal reaction.

00:31:51,881 --> 00:31:53,716
Well, that does go along
with what the bride-to-be

00:31:53,783 --> 00:31:54,717
said about
the victim.

00:31:54,784 --> 00:31:56,519
That he had
a dermatological response

00:31:56,585 --> 00:31:59,021
to the allergen and
not a respiratory one.

00:31:59,088 --> 00:32:00,690
GRISSOM:
Did the assay test

00:32:00,756 --> 00:32:02,224
show any other food allergies?

00:32:02,291 --> 00:32:03,826
No, uh-uh.

00:32:03,893 --> 00:32:06,462
So the cause of death
is still anaphylactic shock.

00:32:06,529 --> 00:32:08,397
Okay, what caused it?

00:32:08,464 --> 00:32:10,866
And who?

00:32:24,666 --> 00:32:26,769
I got your page.

00:32:26,835 --> 00:32:29,972
Who shot your dog?

00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:31,540
Trace tech.

00:32:31,607 --> 00:32:32,975
He analyzed the fuel
from Aaron's pump.

00:32:33,042 --> 00:32:34,476
Confirmed it's diesel.

00:32:34,543 --> 00:32:36,612
The hydrocarbons
found in the tree

00:32:36,678 --> 00:32:38,414
were from unleaded gasoline.

00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,315
Means the fuel
on Aaron's farm

00:32:40,382 --> 00:32:43,018
was not used to
cremate Rita's body.

00:32:43,085 --> 00:32:44,486
Maybe it pumped unleaded
four years ago.

00:32:44,553 --> 00:32:45,988
Converted to diesel
at some point since.

00:32:46,055 --> 00:32:48,657
Ah, I thought
the same thing myself,

00:32:48,724 --> 00:32:49,992
so I called the NDEP.
Mm-hmm.

00:32:50,059 --> 00:32:56,021
E Permit for Aaron's fuel tank
was specifically for diesel.

00:32:56,298 --> 00:32:57,833
Where does that leave us?

00:32:59,401 --> 00:33:01,537
NDEP's database
for Clark County.

00:33:01,603 --> 00:33:05,474
Now, the red dots
represent the areas

00:33:05,541 --> 00:33:06,875
of permitted fuel tanks.

00:33:06,942 --> 00:33:07,876
Isolate Moapa.

00:33:07,943 --> 00:33:09,845
Yeah.

00:33:12,681 --> 00:33:15,517
Aaron's farm's located
at the cross streets

00:33:15,584 --> 00:33:17,486
of White Oak
and Stansberry.

00:33:19,688 --> 00:33:21,323
The burn spot
is a half mile east

00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:23,025
along the river.
Mm-hmm.

00:33:26,695 --> 00:33:29,131
Only two permitted
fuel tanks up in that area.

00:33:29,198 --> 00:33:30,132
The one on the left
is Aaron's.

00:33:30,199 --> 00:33:31,900
We can exclude
that one.

00:33:31,967 --> 00:33:33,669
Who owns
the other one?

00:33:41,643 --> 00:33:42,711
Faye Minden.

00:33:44,146 --> 00:33:47,349
ROBBINS:
We've ruled out food allergy
as the cause of death.

00:33:47,416 --> 00:33:49,184
If it was
an environmental agent,

00:33:49,251 --> 00:33:51,320
I expect one
of the other jurors
had a reaction as well.

00:33:51,387 --> 00:33:55,891
His body reacted to something.

00:33:55,958 --> 00:33:59,228
It's why I'm reexamining
the exposed areas of his body--

00:33:59,294 --> 00:34:01,897
face and the neck.

00:34:07,569 --> 00:34:09,304
Look at this.

00:34:14,643 --> 00:34:17,579
Apis Mellifera Linnaeus.

00:34:20,582 --> 00:34:22,217
We're looking for another body.

00:34:32,895 --> 00:34:35,464
Greg ran the assay test
for bee venom on Chris Gibbons.

00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:37,132
IG levels were spiked.

00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,568
Was Gibbons even aware
that he had a bee allergy?

00:34:39,635 --> 00:34:41,970
Brass finally tracked down
his allergist.

00:34:42,037 --> 00:34:44,573
Gibbons was allergic
to a lot of things.

00:34:51,613 --> 00:34:54,249
The killer, I presume.

00:35:04,293 --> 00:35:05,661
Or what's left of him.

00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:07,796
( <i>buzzing</i> )

00:35:15,003 --> 00:35:16,638
( <i>gasping</i> )

00:35:17,706 --> 00:35:21,443
He had an immediate reaction
to a bee sting.

00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:22,544
Lost consciousness,
fell forward,

00:35:22,611 --> 00:35:23,645
hit his head
on the table.

00:35:23,712 --> 00:35:28,717
You know how Gervis was
complaining that it was too hot.

00:35:28,784 --> 00:35:29,818
He said he opened the window.

00:35:29,885 --> 00:35:32,154
I can't take this anymore!

00:35:32,221 --> 00:35:35,424
Who keeps shutting
this damn window?!

00:35:35,491 --> 00:35:39,395
Well, that explains it.

00:35:39,461 --> 00:35:42,398
It was an outside job.

00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:50,339
Okay, good.
Thank you.

00:35:55,844 --> 00:35:56,812
Hey.
Hey.

00:35:56,879 --> 00:35:59,715
Heard you were over
at Aaron's farm.

00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:01,717
Yep.
I bet that
shook him up.

00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:04,586
Thank you for
pushing forward

00:36:04,653 --> 00:36:05,788
with the
investigation.

00:36:05,854 --> 00:36:08,290
And we continue
to push forward.

00:36:08,357 --> 00:36:10,926
We need to take a sample
of fuel from your pump.

00:36:10,993 --> 00:36:13,162
Yeah. Yeah, you wouldn't mind,
would you, Faye?

00:36:13,228 --> 00:36:14,163
My pump?

00:36:14,229 --> 00:36:15,831
Yeah.

00:36:15,898 --> 00:36:17,032
Well, what'd
he say?

00:36:17,099 --> 00:36:19,535
Didn't I tell you
he'd turn on me?

00:36:19,601 --> 00:36:21,603
Oh, he didn't say anything.

00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:23,439
Just want to take
a look.

00:36:23,505 --> 00:36:24,773
My trees are
Douglas firs.

00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,109
The... the needles
grow in spirals
around the twigs.

00:36:27,176 --> 00:36:28,110
It's amazing.

00:36:28,177 --> 00:36:29,244
Any time you
guys want,

00:36:29,311 --> 00:36:30,879
you come back here,

00:36:30,946 --> 00:36:31,880
take your pick.

00:36:31,947 --> 00:36:33,348
Free of charge.

00:36:33,415 --> 00:36:36,752
The pump on Aaron's farm
is diesel.

00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:40,556
Your sister was cremated
with unleaded.

00:36:44,793 --> 00:36:46,462
You know what?

00:36:46,528 --> 00:36:47,963
Thinking back now,

00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:50,899
I-I remember
Aaron's pump was empty,

00:36:50,966 --> 00:36:53,335
and, uh, he insisted
we drive over here.

00:36:53,402 --> 00:36:55,037
He used mine.

00:36:55,104 --> 00:36:57,005
Sorry for the confusion.

00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:00,342
Excuse me.

00:37:00,409 --> 00:37:03,445
Please say you believe me.

00:37:33,609 --> 00:37:35,277
♪ ♪

00:38:05,541 --> 00:38:08,277
I believe you, Faye.

00:38:09,778 --> 00:38:13,482
You see, blood evidence
doesn't disappear over time.

00:38:13,549 --> 00:38:17,019
Your sister was murdered...

00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:18,454
by you.

00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:20,389
Faye?

00:38:20,456 --> 00:38:21,790
Faye, you in here?

00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,976
STOKES:
<i>Unleaded gasoline,</i>
<i>barrels for incineration,</i>

00:38:41,043 --> 00:38:42,244
<i>cast off on the walls.</i>

00:38:42,311 --> 00:38:44,279
<i>DNA consistent</i>
<i>with Rita Westonson.</i>

00:38:44,346 --> 00:38:46,115
Then he killed Rita
to be with Aaron.

00:38:46,181 --> 00:38:48,817
And a couple of weeks ago,
hears he's getting engaged

00:38:48,884 --> 00:38:50,285
to her younger sister Terry.

00:38:50,352 --> 00:38:51,620
They couldn't
handle it, man.

00:38:51,687 --> 00:38:52,788
She just freaked.

00:38:52,855 --> 00:38:57,459
So she tried to pin
Rita's murder on Aaron.

00:38:57,526 --> 00:39:00,996
Four years ago when I decided
to close the case,

00:39:01,063 --> 00:39:04,867
did you agree
with my decision?

00:39:04,933 --> 00:39:07,970
Well, you were
following protocol.

00:39:08,037 --> 00:39:09,405
And now?

00:39:09,471 --> 00:39:11,573
Now I'd fight you on it, yeah.

00:39:13,842 --> 00:39:15,511
Why?

00:39:15,577 --> 00:39:18,013
Rita Westonson
was a dependable,
predictable girl.

00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,381
We never answered the question

00:39:19,448 --> 00:39:21,583
why she just woke up one morning
and walked away

00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:22,818
from the rest of her life.

00:39:22,885 --> 00:39:23,819
It happens.

00:39:23,886 --> 00:39:26,755
And that's what the evidence
was telling us.

00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:28,891
Well, that's what the <i>physical</i>
<i>evidence was telling us.</i>

00:39:28,957 --> 00:39:30,059
We should have dug deeper.

00:39:30,125 --> 00:39:32,995
You can't just ignore
the human element, Grissom.

00:39:33,062 --> 00:39:34,596
I agree, Nick.

00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:35,998
But when you start
to have feelings

00:39:36,065 --> 00:39:38,033
for the people involved,
you risk your objectivity.

00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,268
So what?

00:39:39,334 --> 00:39:41,870
You know, I'm always getting
criticized for empathizing

00:39:41,937 --> 00:39:43,572
with the victims
and their families,

00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:44,573
but that's who I am.

00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,177
That's how I do my job.

00:39:48,243 --> 00:39:49,311
And as far as the
promotion goes,

00:39:49,378 --> 00:39:50,512
it's all good, man.

00:39:50,579 --> 00:39:52,047
I can live without it.

00:39:52,114 --> 00:39:53,582
I'm not you.

00:40:00,055 --> 00:40:01,090
Good.

00:40:01,156 --> 00:40:03,592
We certainly don't need
another me around here.
