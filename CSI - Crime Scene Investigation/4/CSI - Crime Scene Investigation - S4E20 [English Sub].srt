On the job,

00:09:29,789 --> 00:09:31,524

00:10:08,995 --> 00:10:11,931
Since that's definitely
not Tim Coleman,

00:10:11,998 --> 00:10:13,766
maybe it's our killer.

00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:15,468
Or at least a thief.

00:10:15,535 --> 00:10:17,737

is match a name with the face.

00:10:17,803 --> 00:10:19,105

( <i>cheering</i> )

00:11:03,349 --> 00:11:05,117
ANNOUNCER ( <i>over P.A.</i> ):
120 miles through Baker

00:11:05,184 --> 00:11:07,753
and SWAT and SES neck-and-neck.

00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,622
( <i>cheering</i> )

00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:15,862
SWAT and SES!

00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,632
SWAT and SES!

00:11:19,699 --> 00:11:22,635
LAPD SWAT wins the first time
in eight years.

00:11:22,702 --> 00:11:25,338
Coming in at 13 hours,
24 minutes.

00:11:45,457 --> 00:11:47,026
For the last six years,
I ran the toughest leg

00:11:47,092 --> 00:11:48,027
of the relay...

00:11:48,093 --> 00:11:50,000
against the same
guy from SES.

00:11:50,067 --> 00:11:51,868
But this year,
there was a new guy.

00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,303
Yeah, this cocky kid shows up.

00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:54,771
You're my competition?

00:11:54,838 --> 00:11:56,540
I thought this was supposed
to be the hardest leg.

00:11:56,606 --> 00:11:58,241
Typical SES, all mouth.

00:11:58,308 --> 00:11:58,975
What'd you do?

00:11:59,042 --> 00:11:59,843
Ignored him.

00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,078
Looks like you got
in a fight?

00:12:01,144 --> 00:12:02,345
Hey, I was here to race.

00:12:02,412 --> 00:12:04,181
He cold-cocked me.
I never threw a punch.

00:12:04,247 --> 00:12:07,150
We found red fibers on him
that may match your jacket.

00:12:07,217 --> 00:12:08,752
I'm SWAT. I subdued him.

00:12:08,819 --> 00:12:11,054
( <i>grunting</i> )

00:12:12,656 --> 00:12:14,825
Mind if we take your jacket
to confirm?

00:12:14,891 --> 00:12:15,992
Knock yourself out.

00:12:16,059 --> 00:12:17,928
Not going to find
any blood on it.

00:12:29,072 --> 00:12:32,275
Had a real good talk
with your manager, Clyde.

00:12:32,342 --> 00:12:34,511
How's Fast 'N Fresh
treating you?

00:12:34,578 --> 00:12:36,947
I'm up to $8.75 an hour.

00:12:37,981 --> 00:12:40,150
I guess this kind of beats
saving up, huh?

00:12:42,686 --> 00:12:45,956
Look... is my wife here?

00:12:47,257 --> 00:12:49,626
Is she behind the
glass or something?

00:12:49,693 --> 00:12:52,028
I'll be talking to her
soon enough.

00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:54,030
Oh, come on, now.
Is that really necessary?

00:12:54,097 --> 00:12:56,133
I mean,
I'm just a regular guy...

00:12:56,199 --> 00:12:57,801
Hey, regular guys
don't steal $300

00:12:57,868 --> 00:12:59,903
with a dead cop's
ATM card, man!

00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:01,538
Dead cop?! What are
you talking about?

00:13:01,605 --> 00:13:03,440
Those three bills--
that's-that's my money.

00:13:04,474 --> 00:13:05,976
All right, technically,

00:13:06,042 --> 00:13:08,011
it's my wife's, but...

00:13:10,313 --> 00:13:13,650
I sell this tight little
Asian chick a $3 Tasty Meal.

00:13:13,717 --> 00:13:17,954
She says for $300,
I can get a very tasty meal.

00:13:18,989 --> 00:13:21,858
I was about to go
on my break anyway.

00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,930
My wife's not behind that glass,
right?

00:13:26,997 --> 00:13:30,734
VARTANN:
<i>Hotel security came up</i>
<i>on a noise complaint.</i>

00:13:30,801 --> 00:13:33,003
Found two DBs.

00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:36,006
Room's registered to a uniform
officer, Manny Senteno.

00:13:36,073 --> 00:13:37,507
One of ours?

00:13:37,574 --> 00:13:39,843
Laughlin PD,
but he carries tin,

00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:42,412
so that makes him family.

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,189
Female vic's
Patricia Fielding.

00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:56,026
Also PD.
Bakersfield.

00:14:05,869 --> 00:14:07,637
He check in alone?

00:14:07,704 --> 00:14:09,272
VARTANN:
Yeah, day before yesterday.

00:14:09,339 --> 00:14:10,841
Issued one key,
but his itemized bill

00:14:10,907 --> 00:14:12,309
shows lots of room service
for two.

00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:14,511
SIDLE:
A wife or
girlfriend

00:14:14,578 --> 00:14:17,481
would probably be
on the register.

00:14:29,226 --> 00:14:30,060
Looks like it's all

00:14:30,127 --> 00:14:31,161
his stuff.

00:14:31,228 --> 00:14:33,230
I don't see a
purse around here.

00:14:33,296 --> 00:14:35,966
Guy's away from home,

00:14:36,032 --> 00:14:38,001
unwinds
with some opportunity sex...

00:14:39,569 --> 00:14:41,705
Looks like he came
before he went.

00:14:44,908 --> 00:14:47,411
Glock 19, standard police issue.

00:14:49,813 --> 00:14:52,416
There's something
on the slide.

00:15:05,495 --> 00:15:06,663
14 rounds left.

00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:08,331
15-round magazine.

00:15:08,398 --> 00:15:09,266
Any good cop keeps

00:15:09,332 --> 00:15:10,734
one racked
in the chamber.

00:15:10,801 --> 00:15:12,869
Two bullets, two bodies.

00:15:12,936 --> 00:15:13,670
Put it down!

00:15:13,737 --> 00:15:14,538
You dare me?!

00:15:14,604 --> 00:15:15,439
Put it down!

00:15:18,475 --> 00:15:21,044
I'm thinking
straight-up murder/suicide.

00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:28,652
Tim Coleman's gym bag.

00:15:28,718 --> 00:15:32,556
Gym clothes, towel,
vitamins, pocket knife.

00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:35,992
Protein bar wrapper,

00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:38,328
empty water bottle,
banana peel.

00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:39,763
Why the trash?

00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:41,498
Well, you know,
there's a five-minute penalty

00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:42,899
if you litter the race course.

00:15:42,966 --> 00:15:43,867
Oh.

00:15:43,934 --> 00:15:44,901
What's the best way

00:15:44,968 --> 00:15:46,870
to get chemicals
into your system?

00:15:46,937 --> 00:15:48,205
Injection.

00:15:48,271 --> 00:15:50,373
But there was no
evidence of that.
Second best?

00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,742

00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:54,664
Will Marshall,

00:17:54,731 --> 00:17:55,665
this is Catherine
Willows

00:17:55,732 --> 00:17:56,666
from the Crime Lab.
Hi.

00:17:56,733 --> 00:17:57,768
There is something

00:17:57,834 --> 00:17:59,436
very wrong in the world
if a woman like you

00:17:59,503 --> 00:18:01,438
is only handling
test tubes.

00:18:01,505 --> 00:18:03,106
Well, if you think
that's all I handle,

00:18:03,173 --> 00:18:04,608
you're not as smart
as you think.

00:18:04,674 --> 00:18:08,612
So, you're the L.A. County
team medic, right?

00:18:08,678 --> 00:18:10,414
That means you're responsible
for making sure

00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,215
that all your teammates
are well hydrated.

00:18:12,282 --> 00:18:14,050
Yeah.
Including

00:18:14,117 --> 00:18:15,385
Tim Coleman.

00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,455
Yeah. Hell of a thing, that.

00:18:18,522 --> 00:18:20,524
You're currently #1
on the SES's

00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:21,792
transfer list.

00:18:21,858 --> 00:18:23,527
Same spot you were
two months ago

00:18:23,593 --> 00:18:25,328
when they bypassed you
to transfer in

00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:26,596
Tim Coleman, right?

00:18:26,663 --> 00:18:28,298
Six months I'm on the top
of the list.

00:18:28,365 --> 00:18:32,569
January 31 comes, and they reach
over me and take Coleman.

00:18:32,636 --> 00:18:33,570
That's the cutoff date

00:18:33,637 --> 00:18:34,805
to run in the race.

00:18:34,871 --> 00:18:36,173
Coleman was a ringer.

00:18:36,239 --> 00:18:37,207
Ding-ding.

00:18:37,274 --> 00:18:39,376
SES transferred him
in for speed, not skill.

00:18:39,443 --> 00:18:41,812
Might not be another
opening for years.

00:18:41,878 --> 00:18:43,814
I'm not getting any younger.

00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,451
And after all of that,
Coleman doesn't even run.

00:18:47,517 --> 00:18:49,486
He had a good excuse.

00:18:49,553 --> 00:18:51,121
Did you give it to him?

00:18:51,188 --> 00:18:52,656
If I'm going to kill a guy,

00:18:52,723 --> 00:18:55,492
I'm not going to do it
with 20,000 cops around.

00:18:56,526 --> 00:18:57,561
Well...

00:18:57,627 --> 00:18:58,962
sounds like
you've been giving it

00:18:59,029 --> 00:19:00,130
some serious thought.

00:19:00,197 --> 00:19:01,631
Well, every cop does.

00:19:01,698 --> 00:19:03,567
My way?

00:19:03,633 --> 00:19:06,536
A sniper shot...
200 meters out.

00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:07,904
Coleman'd
never even hear

00:19:07,971 --> 00:19:09,740
the "am" in "blam."

00:19:35,565 --> 00:19:37,000
Okay?

00:19:46,209 --> 00:19:50,647
Mrs. Senteno, is
this your husband?

00:19:50,714 --> 00:19:53,683
He doesn't wear his hair
like that.

00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,021
There's some forms for you
to sign, then we can talk

00:19:58,088 --> 00:19:59,689
in the lounge.

00:19:59,756 --> 00:20:01,124
What happened?

00:20:01,191 --> 00:20:02,325
Mrs. Senteno,

00:20:02,392 --> 00:20:03,760
we haven't finished
our investigation yet,

00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:06,296
but your husband died
from a gunshot wound.

00:20:06,363 --> 00:20:07,631
Who shot him?

00:20:07,697 --> 00:20:09,599
We don't know.

00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,968
Where was he found?

00:20:12,035 --> 00:20:14,004
In his hotel room.

00:20:21,578 --> 00:20:24,181
He wasn't alone, was he?

00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:27,050
No.

00:20:27,117 --> 00:20:29,186
I married a cop.

00:20:29,252 --> 00:20:31,154
With that comes alcohol

00:20:31,221 --> 00:20:33,390
and women to take
the edge off.

00:20:33,457 --> 00:20:38,495
First time...
he said it meant nothing.

00:20:38,562 --> 00:20:41,798
He promised never
to do it again.

00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:46,536
By the third time...
I told him to stop confessing.

00:20:46,603 --> 00:20:49,039
I wasn't going anywhere.

00:20:50,607 --> 00:20:52,509
Don't ask, don't tell.

00:20:52,576 --> 00:20:54,544
I wasn't willing to trade
my family

00:20:54,611 --> 00:20:57,214
for the flavor of the month.

00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,350
That doesn't make me pathetic.

00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:09,159
What happened?

00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:10,494
Break the bad news
to the wife?

00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,895
Oh, I didn't have to.

00:21:11,962 --> 00:21:13,830
( <i>sighs</i> ):
Women always know, huh?

00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:15,999
Not always.
I think so.

00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,834
Women always know when
the man is straying.

00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:19,503
What are you,
the voice of experience?

00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:21,171
( <i>laughs</i> ):
No. I'm a really
nice guy.

00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:23,006
Oh, I believe you.

00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:24,641
Well, you need
to believe this.

00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,843
There was one bullet
in each of the bodies.

00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,845
They both came
from the Glock.

00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:31,681
And the prints on the
Glock are from a female,

00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:34,351
so it's still looking
like a murder/suicide.

00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:36,186
All right.

00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,688
Hey. You anywhere
on my fibers?

00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:41,758
I'm dealing with a lot
of things today.

00:21:41,825 --> 00:21:45,395
My phone has been ringing
off the hook.

00:21:45,462 --> 00:21:47,631
CSI is taking a ton of crap
because we didn't finish

00:21:47,697 --> 00:21:49,900
the race.
There was a dead
cop in the desert.

00:21:49,966 --> 00:21:52,903
That's what I kept telling them,
and they tell me, "Good excuse."

00:21:54,571 --> 00:21:56,940
The white fibers found
on the gun slide

00:21:57,007 --> 00:21:59,876
is tissue: the common
nose-picking variety

00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:01,978
with gun oil residue.

00:22:02,045 --> 00:22:03,980
Are you saying that
the gun was wiped down

00:22:04,047 --> 00:22:05,315
and the prints were planted?

00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:10,153
No, you're saying that.

00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,822
I don't get to say that.

00:22:11,888 --> 00:22:15,025
But somebody else
could've pulled the trigger.

00:22:19,667 --> 00:22:22,583
FRANCO:
Manny Sentero's prints
are all over the room,

00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:25,410
including the champagne bottle
and one of the glasses.

00:22:25,476 --> 00:22:26,778
What about
Patricia Fielding's?

00:22:26,844 --> 00:22:28,079
Hotel room door,
inside knob.

00:22:28,146 --> 00:22:29,280
And the murder
weapon.

00:22:29,347 --> 00:22:31,182
That's it?

00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:33,384
Are you sure?

00:22:34,652 --> 00:22:35,820
I-I'm sorry.

00:22:35,887 --> 00:22:37,155
It just doesn't make any sense.

00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:39,257
The sex kits came back negative,
and now this.

00:22:39,324 --> 00:22:40,792
I mean,
that room reeked of musk.

00:22:40,858 --> 00:22:43,294
Well, maybe he swapped fluids
with someone else.

00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:45,163
There was
a third set of prints.

00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,798
I ran it through AFIS.

00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:49,067
Got a hit on a cop.

00:22:49,133 --> 00:22:50,401
Another one.

00:22:50,468 --> 00:22:52,503
SIDLE:
Lydia Lopez,
Bakersfield PD.

00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:55,006
That's the same division
as Patricia Fielding's.

00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:57,041
Well, according to Histology,

00:22:57,108 --> 00:23:00,011
Tim Coleman's muscle cells
were hyper-hydrated,

00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:02,080
yet his body was dehydrated.

00:23:02,146 --> 00:23:03,314
Well, that condition's

00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:05,316
normally associated
with drug abuse.

00:23:05,383 --> 00:23:07,919
Right. But apart
from the furosemide,

00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:09,454
his tox was negative.

00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,123
So, I took another
look at the guy.

00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:15,960
Buff, cut, aggressive.

00:23:16,027 --> 00:23:18,096
Made me think steroids.

00:23:18,162 --> 00:23:19,264
Kind of risky for a cop,

00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:21,633
considering they're subject
to random drug tests.

00:23:21,699 --> 00:23:23,968
Well, steroids are controlled,
but creatine isn't.

00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:25,537
It's a legal way

00:23:25,603 --> 00:23:27,972
to bulk up.

00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:31,042
Tim Coleman was using it.

00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:32,477
Creatine pulls

00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:35,680
the potassium from the blood
and moves it into the muscles.

00:23:38,816 --> 00:23:40,885
Dehydrating the body
in the process.

00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:43,521
Exactly.
And you add furosemide to it,

00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:46,558
and you get a severe
electrolyte imbalance.

00:23:46,624 --> 00:23:49,827
Leading to arrhythmia,
and consequently cardiac arrest.

00:23:55,733 --> 00:23:58,102
So, what's our problem?

00:23:58,169 --> 00:23:59,370
The dose.

00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:01,072
There wasn't enough

00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:04,642
furosemide in the water
to make that happen.

00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,185
Lydia Lopez--
the girl next door.

00:24:15,253 --> 00:24:16,321
( <i>knocking</i> )

00:24:16,387 --> 00:24:18,523
CSI. Hello.

00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:19,591
Her division captain

00:24:19,657 --> 00:24:21,059
wants every
professional courtesy

00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:23,461
extended to her.

00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,342
Interesting.

00:24:37,408 --> 00:24:38,543
Yeah.

00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,082
Her clothes
are still here.

00:24:44,148 --> 00:24:46,618
But I guess if you
offed two people,

00:24:46,684 --> 00:24:49,621
you're not going to
stick around to pack.

00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:54,859
Adjoining door's open.

00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:56,895
Maybe they wanted it that way.

00:24:56,961 --> 00:24:58,963
So, Manny and Lydia were boning.

00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,099
How does Patricia Fielding
fit in?

00:25:01,165 --> 00:25:02,534
I don't know.

00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,669
Isn't the prevailing
male fantasy two on one?

00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:09,807
So, let's say three of them
were going at it.

00:25:09,874 --> 00:25:12,343
How did two out of
three end up dead?

00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:17,048
Well, if Lydia said no,
and Manny went for it anyway...

00:25:22,787 --> 00:25:26,090
Well, someone was pissed.

00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:27,425
This is,
like, a two,

00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:29,127
$300 La Perla nightie,

00:25:29,193 --> 00:25:30,295
ripped to shreds.

00:25:30,361 --> 00:25:31,829
Oh, looks comfortable.

00:25:31,896 --> 00:25:34,532
It's not designed
to stay on that long.

00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:44,976
This is a man's wedding ring.

00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,711
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:49,380
Yeah.

00:25:49,447 --> 00:25:54,118
Manny was
wearing a ring.

00:25:54,185 --> 00:25:55,587
Was Lydia Lopez married?

00:25:55,653 --> 00:25:57,088
I'll ask her.

00:25:57,155 --> 00:25:59,991
She walked into LVPD
ten minutes ago.

00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:01,326
My CO calls and tells me

00:26:01,392 --> 00:26:03,194
that Patty Fielding's
been murdered,

00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:05,830
and you're about to broadcast
a citywide for my 20.

00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,532
What the hell's going on
in this town?

00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:09,133
That's what we'd like to know.

00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,169
I hope you've got
your story straight.

00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,771
Didn't know I needed one.

00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:18,576
Patricia Fielding was killed
in the room adjoining yours.

00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:22,380
Manny's room?

00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:23,848
Where's Manny?

00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:26,684
Manny's on a slab
next to Patricia.

00:26:35,059 --> 00:26:36,160
Look,

00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:38,796
we know that you and Manny
were together.

00:26:38,863 --> 00:26:41,466
Once a year
for seven years running.

00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:43,968
Desert Relay
is our time together.

00:26:44,035 --> 00:26:46,204
Then we go back to our lives.

00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:47,672
That's sweet.

00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:50,308
What was Sergeant Fielding
doing in your lover's room?

00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:51,442
I don't know.

00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:52,544
You don't know.

00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:54,245
You know, I heard
that Manny Senteno

00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:55,346
was a real player.

00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:57,081
Maybe he moved on,
and you didn't like that.

00:26:57,148 --> 00:26:58,483
Who told you that?

00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,552
Manny doesn't mess around.

00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:01,219
Except with you.

00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,154
Yes.

00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:04,222
How could you know that

00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:05,723
if the only part you know
is his body?

00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,926
Pedestal's a little high,
don't you think?

00:27:07,992 --> 00:27:10,428
Your best friend,
your lover are dead.

00:27:10,495 --> 00:27:12,397
What do you expect me to think?

00:27:12,463 --> 00:27:13,464
I don't know what happened.

00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:14,832
I do know
that Manny loves his wife

00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:17,168
just like I
love my husband.

00:27:17,235 --> 00:27:19,404
It's just an itch we scratched
every 12 months.

00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:20,538
It doesn't mean anything.

00:27:20,605 --> 00:27:21,539
It meant enough

00:27:21,606 --> 00:27:22,907
to someone to trash your room.

00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:24,776
Archie.

00:27:24,842 --> 00:27:26,110
Archie-- your husband.

00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:27,178
Mm-hmm.

00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:28,580
Did he catch
the two of you together?

00:27:28,646 --> 00:27:32,050
No. He wasn't even supposed
to be in Vegas.

00:27:32,116 --> 00:27:33,384
This is my time.

00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:34,652
I heard he was
looking for me.

00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:36,421
He must've got a key
from the front desk.

00:27:36,487 --> 00:27:39,224
Probably took one
look at the room
and went ballistic.

00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:41,259
Did you see
what he did to my teddy?

00:27:42,193 --> 00:27:44,229
That was Archie's gift to me.

00:27:44,295 --> 00:27:46,397
Hey, most husbands

00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:48,199
who buy lingerie

00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:51,436
expect that they're the ones
who're going to be enjoying it.

00:27:51,502 --> 00:27:53,071
I look good in it.

00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:56,975
Archie didn't do this.

00:27:57,041 --> 00:27:58,543
He couldn't.

00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:05,083
The manager says Clyde Grimes

00:28:05,149 --> 00:28:07,485
took a break around 3:00.

00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:10,922
That's consistent
with bank records.

00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:13,925
$300 withdraw to
Clyde's account

00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:15,793
registered at 3:06.

00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,962
But the video shows him

00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:20,999
using Tim Coleman's card
at 4:06.

00:28:21,065 --> 00:28:22,834
Yeah, one hour later.

00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:26,137
Well, maybe
I'm not the only one

00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:28,673
who gets screwed up
by Daylight Savings Time.

00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,476
What if the ATM and the camera
were out of synch?

00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:34,178
How? The camera's
part of the ATM.

00:28:34,245 --> 00:28:36,347
Video is controlled
by the branch office.

00:28:36,414 --> 00:28:38,349
ATM connects
to the national network.

00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:39,817
Separate systems.

00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:41,753
If the clocks
weren't synchronized...

00:28:41,819 --> 00:28:44,055
Then the guy who used
Tim Coleman's card

00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:46,090
should be on video
one hour later.

00:28:57,902 --> 00:29:01,072
He's, uh, emptying the ATM.

00:31:31,155 --> 00:31:33,591
Hey, is everybody all right?

00:31:33,658 --> 00:31:35,026
Hey, you stupid jackass!

00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:36,427
I'm with the Vegas Crime Lab.

00:31:36,494 --> 00:31:37,829
Yo, yo, where's
the fire, my man?

00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,498
( <i>grunting</i> )

00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:50,508
Ha!

00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,978
No wonder you were in a hurry.

00:31:56,583 --> 00:31:58,818
STOKES:
Well, Mr. Drake,
I suppose this is one way

00:31:58,885 --> 00:31:59,986
to make eight years

00:32:00,053 --> 00:32:02,792
in an injection molding factory
pay off.

00:32:02,858 --> 00:32:04,727
You're certainly good
with plastics.

00:32:11,868 --> 00:32:13,236
STOKES:
<i>It was a good scam.</i>

00:32:13,302 --> 00:32:15,538
<i>Your reader transmits</i>
<i>the card number to you,</i>

00:32:15,605 --> 00:32:18,107
<i>and the camera records</i>
<i>the sucker's PIN number.</i>

00:32:20,076 --> 00:32:21,944
I should have used
better transmitters.

00:32:22,011 --> 00:32:23,846
I wouldn't have had
to stick so close.

00:32:23,913 --> 00:32:25,047
You raked in over

00:32:25,114 --> 00:32:27,049
$13,000 off 62

00:32:27,116 --> 00:32:28,251
skimmed accounts.

00:32:28,317 --> 00:32:29,986
That was just
the first two days.

00:32:30,052 --> 00:32:31,787
And I checked the bank records.

00:32:31,854 --> 00:32:34,357
All of the cards you stole
belonged to cops.

00:32:34,423 --> 00:32:37,260
I know.

00:32:37,326 --> 00:32:39,462
You know, I'm facing
multiple felony counts here.

00:32:39,528 --> 00:32:42,365
Comprehensive theft,
card fraud.

00:32:42,431 --> 00:32:44,400
I'm going away for years.

00:32:44,467 --> 00:32:46,269
Everyone here knows that.

00:32:46,335 --> 00:32:48,271
But when I got booked,

00:32:48,337 --> 00:32:51,407
they wrote me up
for two moving violations.

00:32:52,675 --> 00:32:54,577
I hate cops.

00:32:56,345 --> 00:32:58,347
I picked up Lydia Lopez's
husband at Cheetah's.

00:32:58,414 --> 00:32:59,682
He was groping the strippers.

00:32:59,749 --> 00:33:01,017
Classic drunk-and-disorderly.

00:33:01,083 --> 00:33:02,218
When I got there,

00:33:02,285 --> 00:33:04,053
the bouncer was just about
to tune him up.

00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,221
For what?

00:33:05,288 --> 00:33:07,089
Yakking on his suit.

VARTANN:
Archie Lopez.

00:33:18,201 --> 00:33:19,569
So what?

00:33:19,635 --> 00:33:22,071
BROWN:
Your prints were found
in your wife's hotel room,

00:33:22,138 --> 00:33:24,173
including the doorknob
to the adjoining room.

00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,542
Yeah.

00:33:26,609 --> 00:33:28,844
Patricia Fielding was killed
in that room.

00:33:28,911 --> 00:33:30,213
So was Manny
Senteno.

00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:32,048
Hmm. My heart bleeds.

00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:36,219

probably still drunk, yeah.

00:33:38,321 --> 00:33:39,522
Must have been the tequila.

00:33:39,589 --> 00:33:40,923
I don't drink that much.

00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:42,925

And then I left.

Where did you go?

00:34:05,848 --> 00:34:07,550
I went to the hotel bar.

That woman's been to my house.

She's eaten my food.

00:34:18,294 --> 00:34:21,030
She smiled in my face,

I went somewhere else.

00:34:31,574 --> 00:34:32,742
I drank some more.

00:34:32,808 --> 00:34:33,743
I drank...

A lot, I guess.

Ditto on his

But I know Archie
was in Manny's room

because he has
Manny's luggage tag.

Is there an address

Yeah.

He called this number

The last call was 12 minutes.

Archie Lopez called you.

He was drunk.

From the tissue that you used

to wipe the gun.

00:40:20,957 --> 00:40:22,992

She answered the door
like she belonged there.

Where's your kit?

Actually, we have all
the evidence we need.

00:41:20,716 --> 00:41:23,085
Then what the hell
are you doing here?

00:41:23,152 --> 00:41:25,655
I have a question.

00:41:25,721 --> 00:41:28,391
Off the record.

00:41:31,928 --> 00:41:34,096
I wasn't trying to kill him.

00:41:34,163 --> 00:41:36,933
Then why did you do this?

00:41:39,302 --> 00:41:41,604
Leg 16 was mine.

00:41:41,671 --> 00:41:45,274
I ran it eight years in a row.

00:41:45,341 --> 00:41:47,944
I won every time.

00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:50,279
Then the bosses transfer in
that kid,

00:41:50,346 --> 00:41:53,216
kick me upstairs,
and give him my race.

00:41:55,585 --> 00:41:57,720
No way I was going
to let him do better than me.

00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:02,625
Sooner or later,

00:42:02,692 --> 00:42:04,694
everybody gets replaced.

00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:08,497
Talk to me
