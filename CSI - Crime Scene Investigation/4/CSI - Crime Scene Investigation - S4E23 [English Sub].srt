00:06:26,611 --> 00:06:28,313
Some kind of SUV.

Black, I think.

00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:33,819
Can you start
from the beginning?

00:06:36,722 --> 00:06:39,191
I was, um, driving home
from work.

<i>There's hardly any traffic</i>
<i>once you cross Horizon Ranch.</i>

00:06:46,331 --> 00:06:49,134
<i>He was tailgating.</i>

<i>I slowed down</i>

00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:54,473
to let him pass
and he hit me.

<i>I wasn't going to stop,</i>
<i>but he did,</i>

00:06:59,778 --> 00:07:01,546
so I pulled over.

00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:06,785
You're not supposed to leave
the scene of an accident.

00:07:08,787 --> 00:07:10,489
He looked like a normal guy.

00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,491
He asked
if I was okay.

00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,926
Apologized.

00:07:14,993 --> 00:07:17,796
He went to his car to get
his insurance information.

00:07:17,863 --> 00:07:20,165
I was looking at my bumper.

00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:25,804
<i>He punched me in the face,</i>
<i>threw me over his shoulder.</i>

00:07:25,871 --> 00:07:28,940
<i>I lost my shoes.</i>

00:07:29,007 --> 00:07:32,511
<i>He threw me on the ground,</i>

00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:35,447
<i>took off my jacket,</i>
<i>ripped open my shirt.</i>

00:07:35,514 --> 00:07:38,016
He kept trying
to kiss me on the mouth,

00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,052
and I kept turning away.

00:07:40,118 --> 00:07:41,586
So he bit my ear.

00:07:47,426 --> 00:07:50,062
He wanted me to look at him.

00:07:50,128 --> 00:07:51,963
He was going to kill me.

00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:56,101
<i>He ripped off my skirt.</i>

00:07:56,168 --> 00:07:59,204
<i>He raped me.</i>

00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:01,907
He didn't use a condom.

00:08:01,973 --> 00:08:05,444
He got up to zip,

00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:08,780
and I kicked him
in the groin and I ran.

00:08:08,847 --> 00:08:10,449
And the rest,
I guess you know.

00:08:12,184 --> 00:08:15,687
Thank you.

00:08:15,754 --> 00:08:18,356
That was very specific.

00:08:18,423 --> 00:08:21,259
You said that
you looked at him.

00:08:21,326 --> 00:08:23,528
Could you describe him
to a forensic artist?

WOMAN:

<i>about the face?</i>

00:08:35,374 --> 00:08:38,577
He had bright eyes.

00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,645
What about the shape
of the eyes?

00:08:40,712 --> 00:08:44,916
Almond.

00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:46,752
Tiny pupils.

What about the rest
of the face?

00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:52,591
He had a baby face.

00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:58,430
High forehead, thin lips,
clean-shaven.

00:08:58,497 --> 00:09:01,633
Like a crewcut?

00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,403
No, like he had
a regular haircut.

00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:10,575

00:09:10,642 --> 00:09:14,479
How many vacation days
do you have on the books?

00:09:14,546 --> 00:09:18,116
About ten weeks, I guess.

00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:19,151
Why?

00:09:19,217 --> 00:09:22,154
I think you should
take a week or two.

00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:25,624
I'm still on the case.

00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:28,160
I just didn't do the interview
for once in my life.

00:09:32,264 --> 00:09:34,800
When was the last time
you took vacation?

00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:36,568
Never, right?

that will be
of use to you.

00:10:22,814 --> 00:10:25,283
But before you get it,
I need a decision.

00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,051
What?

00:10:26,118 --> 00:10:27,319
I'm tired of being

00:10:27,386 --> 00:10:28,587

00:10:28,653 --> 00:10:31,757
Either I'm in the lab
or I'm in the field.

00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:34,259
Which is it?

00:10:34,326 --> 00:10:37,562
Well, as soon as you can find
and train a replacement,

00:10:37,629 --> 00:10:39,064
you can be in the field.

00:10:39,131 --> 00:10:40,966
Until then, I need you
in the lab.

00:10:41,033 --> 00:10:42,100
Now give.

00:10:42,167 --> 00:10:45,904
I got a CODIS hit
off the semen from your victim.

00:10:45,971 --> 00:10:49,174

a rape-murder case
from a year ago.

No, thank you.

Victim was a 32-
year-old Caucasian
female, Emma Dobbins.

00:11:02,054 --> 00:11:03,655
Sexually assaulted.

00:11:03,722 --> 00:11:05,657
Cause of death,
strangulation.

00:11:05,724 --> 00:11:08,026
They used her pantyhose.

00:11:08,093 --> 00:11:09,461
Where'd they find
the body?

00:11:09,528 --> 00:11:12,898
Off of Blue Diamond Road,
southern highlands.

00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:15,967
That's not far from
where Linley Parker
was assaulted.

00:11:16,034 --> 00:11:17,869
Other than the semen,
the only evidence

00:11:17,936 --> 00:11:20,205
at the scene was a shoe
print-- man's size nine.

00:11:20,272 --> 00:11:21,440
I talked to Nick.

00:11:21,506 --> 00:11:23,341
They also found a
print-- size nine.

00:11:23,408 --> 00:11:25,510
Did she have a car?

00:11:25,577 --> 00:11:28,447
A vintage Pontiac.

00:11:28,513 --> 00:11:29,981

Emma Dobbins ran

Linley Parker was single.

00:11:45,197 --> 00:11:47,099
Blonde.
She was brunette.

Well, according

Todd Coombs is

00:26:45,457 --> 00:26:47,359
and I spent
the night in jail.

00:26:47,426 --> 00:26:48,894
That's right, that's right.

00:26:50,228 --> 00:26:51,663
Hey, let me tell
you something.

00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:53,999
12 hours after Linley Parker
ID'd you as her rapist,

00:26:54,066 --> 00:26:56,301
she gets dragged out of
her car on Fremont Street.

00:26:56,368 --> 00:26:57,569
Now she's missing.

00:26:57,636 --> 00:27:01,773
Then why are you wasting
time talking to me?

00:27:06,378 --> 00:27:08,480
Drive safely.

00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:23,095
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

00:27:23,161 --> 00:27:24,196
Crime lab.

00:27:24,262 --> 00:27:25,597
Yeah, this is Jim Brass.

00:27:25,664 --> 00:27:28,366
Can you send a CSI
to my location

00:27:28,433 --> 00:27:30,302
for evidence recovery.

00:27:30,368 --> 00:27:33,705
STOKES:
250 feet.

00:27:33,772 --> 00:27:36,308
200, still moving.

00:27:36,374 --> 00:27:37,776
Linley!

00:27:37,843 --> 00:27:40,779
150 feet.

00:27:40,846 --> 00:27:43,815
Linley!

00:27:43,882 --> 00:27:45,217
Eighty.

00:27:45,283 --> 00:27:48,286
70, 60,
still moving.

00:27:48,353 --> 00:27:50,989
Fifty.

00:27:51,056 --> 00:27:53,024
Okay, okay,
she stopped.

00:27:53,091 --> 00:27:54,760
30 feet, she's
right here.

00:27:54,826 --> 00:27:56,595
30 feet.

00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,648
MAN:
Over here!

00:29:54,081 --> 00:29:55,850
SIDLE:
Checked with county records.

00:29:55,916 --> 00:29:57,918
Crime scenes
on a 20-acre plot.

00:29:57,985 --> 00:30:00,254
Guess who owns the property.

00:30:00,321 --> 00:30:01,722
One of the
Coombs brothers.

00:30:01,789 --> 00:30:03,591
Coombs brother's company.

00:30:06,594 --> 00:30:07,795
Guy's an
artist.

00:30:07,862 --> 00:30:09,797
You call that art?

00:30:12,733 --> 00:30:14,535
SIDLE:
Black SUV.

00:30:14,602 --> 00:30:15,836
( <i>yelling</i> )

00:30:15,903 --> 00:30:17,872
You're on my property!

00:30:18,572 --> 00:30:19,340
Put the weapon down.

00:30:19,407 --> 00:30:20,841
You're on my property!

00:30:20,908 --> 00:30:21,942
Las Vegas Police,
drop it

00:30:22,009 --> 00:30:23,844
or we shoot.

00:30:23,911 --> 00:30:24,779
Turn around.

00:30:30,818 --> 00:30:31,919
Are you Kevin Coombs?

00:30:31,986 --> 00:30:33,421
I can see the family
resemblance.

00:30:33,487 --> 00:30:34,522
Come on.

00:30:38,426 --> 00:30:39,827
'Cause of death,

00:30:39,894 --> 00:30:42,096
asphyxia due
to strangulation.

00:30:42,163 --> 00:30:44,699
Victim has
a hairline fracture

00:30:44,765 --> 00:30:46,367
of the right third
metacarpal

00:30:46,434 --> 00:30:48,969
with some soft
tissue swelling.

00:30:49,036 --> 00:30:51,272
GRISSOM:
Defensive wounds.

00:30:51,338 --> 00:30:52,606
She was a fighter.

00:30:52,673 --> 00:30:55,476
There's also fresh contusions of
the right labia.

00:30:56,744 --> 00:30:58,145
She was raped again?

00:30:58,212 --> 00:31:00,548
I did a wet mount of
the vaginal secretion

00:31:00,614 --> 00:31:02,283
with a Christmas tree stain.

00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:04,785
Slide's under the scope.

00:31:10,224 --> 00:31:11,759
Sperm.

00:31:11,826 --> 00:31:13,594
If he was trying
to silence a witness,

00:31:13,661 --> 00:31:15,663
why not just kill her,
why rape her again?

00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:18,532
Maybe rape was just
foreplay for this guy.

00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:21,936
Maybe what he really
gets off on is killing.

00:31:27,875 --> 00:31:30,511
( <i>camera clicking</i> )

00:31:30,578 --> 00:31:32,079
What do
you got?

00:31:32,146 --> 00:31:34,048
Maybe a missing

00:31:34,115 --> 00:31:35,916
Pontiac Tempest.

00:31:46,694 --> 00:31:48,829
So, you were home
last night?

00:31:51,399 --> 00:31:53,768
Okay, well, doesn't
really matter.

00:31:53,834 --> 00:31:55,803
Your DNA will
do the talking.

00:31:58,639 --> 00:31:59,573
You know what happens

00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,075
when the government
gets your DNA?

00:32:01,142 --> 00:32:02,610
Enlighten me.

00:32:02,676 --> 00:32:04,445
They put it in the database.

00:32:04,512 --> 00:32:06,614
Then they look at your driver's
license picture

00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,948
and then all those cameras--

00:32:08,015 --> 00:32:11,452
traffic lights, parking lots,
grocery stores...

00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:14,021
They can find you.

00:32:14,088 --> 00:32:16,357
Whenever they want.

00:32:24,065 --> 00:32:25,733
Dr. Coombs.

00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,835
Mr. Grissom.

00:32:27,902 --> 00:32:29,503
I suppose you're compelling

00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:31,338
a DNA sample
from my brother now.

00:32:31,405 --> 00:32:32,606
We are.

00:32:34,141 --> 00:32:35,876
Why are you here?

00:32:35,943 --> 00:32:38,713
Are you an only child?

00:32:38,779 --> 00:32:39,880
I am. Why?

00:32:39,947 --> 00:32:41,916
You've got my brother
in that room, he's family.

00:32:41,982 --> 00:32:43,217
I didn't want him to be alone.

00:32:43,284 --> 00:32:46,754
Well, what about
your other brothers?

00:32:46,821 --> 00:32:49,423
Bailey only looks out
for number one.

00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:50,591
Roger and Larry,

00:32:50,658 --> 00:32:52,026
they do their
best to avoid Kevin.

00:32:52,093 --> 00:32:53,160
They don't
understand him.

00:32:53,227 --> 00:32:54,095
And you do?

00:32:54,161 --> 00:32:55,296
He's harmless.

00:32:55,363 --> 00:32:56,664
He chooses to live alone.

00:32:56,731 --> 00:32:57,898
He lives off the grid.

00:32:57,965 --> 00:33:00,434
He spends all his time
turning junk into art.

00:33:00,501 --> 00:33:01,836
Where does he get his "junk"?

00:33:01,902 --> 00:33:04,271
Mostly from my brother's garage.

00:33:04,338 --> 00:33:05,873
Every once in a while,

00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:09,110
Roger lets Kevin take his pick
of the wrecks.

00:33:09,176 --> 00:33:12,079
Beats inviting him over
for Thanksgiving, you know?

00:33:12,146 --> 00:33:15,950
Dr. Coombs, we found
a 1968 Pontiac

00:33:16,017 --> 00:33:18,219
outside your
brother's house.

00:33:18,285 --> 00:33:19,587
The VIN matched a car

00:33:19,653 --> 00:33:21,255
belonging to a victim
who was raped and murdered

00:33:21,322 --> 00:33:24,225
by the same person who raped
Linley Parker.

00:33:24,291 --> 00:33:27,728
And we found Linley
Parker's dead body

00:33:27,795 --> 00:33:29,930
on your brother's property.

00:33:29,997 --> 00:33:33,768
You guys have been wrong before.

00:34:19,013 --> 00:34:20,481
Whew, man.

00:34:21,849 --> 00:34:23,751
Guys like Brass have it easy.

00:34:23,818 --> 00:34:26,020
All they got to do
is call it in.

00:34:26,087 --> 00:34:28,522
Check this out.
I just found it in the hose.

00:34:28,589 --> 00:34:31,459
It's from a potted plant
purchased at the House Company.

00:34:31,525 --> 00:34:35,196
Confirms
Todd Coombs' alibi.

00:34:35,262 --> 00:34:38,299
WARRICK:
You saw this?

00:34:38,366 --> 00:34:39,433
A pin from the Palms.

00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,569
Linley Parker worked
at the Palms.

00:34:44,839 --> 00:34:47,074
A lot of people
work at the Palms.

00:34:47,141 --> 00:34:49,577
And it doesn't nail
Todd Coombs.

00:34:49,643 --> 00:34:51,011
According to the DNA,

00:34:51,078 --> 00:34:54,148
the blood from Linley Parker's
smashed window

00:34:54,215 --> 00:34:56,650
matches the semen
from all the rapes.

00:34:56,717 --> 00:34:59,153
Which means
it doesn't match
Todd Coombs.

00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,187
Or Kevin Coombs.

00:35:00,254 --> 00:35:03,357
Or any of the rest
of the Brothers Grimm.

00:35:03,424 --> 00:35:07,528
Linley was absolutely certain
that Todd Coombs raped her.

00:35:07,595 --> 00:35:08,963
That's not
what the evidence says.

00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:10,231
Well, maybe the evidence
is wrong.

00:35:10,297 --> 00:35:12,266
You can be wrong,
I can be wrong,

00:35:12,333 --> 00:35:14,368
the evidence
is just the evidence.

00:35:14,435 --> 00:35:16,470
Deep down, tell me you don't
think this guy is good for this.

00:35:18,906 --> 00:35:20,241
I got the DNA on the hair

00:35:20,307 --> 00:35:22,243
you lifted off
Linley Parker's body.

00:35:22,309 --> 00:35:24,512
Get this. It's Todd Coombs.

00:35:24,578 --> 00:35:26,280
Puts him with the body.

00:35:26,347 --> 00:35:27,748
It doesn't prove rape.

00:35:27,815 --> 00:35:30,051
I'll have Brass bring him in.

00:35:43,731 --> 00:35:46,367
Would you strip down
to your shorts, please, Doctor?

00:35:46,434 --> 00:35:47,768
Why?

00:35:47,835 --> 00:35:49,437
I'm going to examine
your clothing

00:35:49,503 --> 00:35:50,638
for any trace evidence,

00:35:50,705 --> 00:35:53,140
and we're going
to document your body
for any injuries

00:35:53,207 --> 00:35:55,209
that may have been sustained
during a recent struggle.

00:35:55,276 --> 00:35:57,611
I don't have any injuries.

00:35:57,678 --> 00:36:00,948
If you'd like,
this officer will
assist you.

00:36:01,015 --> 00:36:02,483
I did not rape
that women.

00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:03,651
I did not kill her.

00:36:03,718 --> 00:36:06,053
You guys proved that
and you let me go.

00:36:26,407 --> 00:36:28,976
Thank you.
Turn around, please.

00:36:33,948 --> 00:36:35,883
That's an old scar.

00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:37,618
I was a bone marrow donor.

00:36:37,685 --> 00:36:40,087
My youngest brother Joss
had leukemia.

00:36:43,391 --> 00:36:44,458
Hold still please.

00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:04,979
Turn off the lights,
would you, please, officer?

00:37:22,697 --> 00:37:24,865
What are you looking at?

00:38:37,038 --> 00:38:37,972
This is harassment.

00:38:38,039 --> 00:38:40,174
I've already given you guys
a DNA sample.

00:38:42,777 --> 00:38:46,414
You know that bone marrow
donation you gave your brother?

00:38:48,149 --> 00:38:50,351
I checked
your medical records.

00:38:50,418 --> 00:38:54,955
His body rejected it
and he died.

00:38:55,022 --> 00:38:58,459
My guess is that's
when you first found out

00:38:58,526 --> 00:39:00,861
about your unique condition.

00:39:10,905 --> 00:39:14,508
The doctors explained it.

00:39:14,575 --> 00:39:17,411
I'm a creature of myth.

00:39:17,478 --> 00:39:20,414
A chimera.

00:39:20,481 --> 00:39:24,618
Head of a lion,
body of a goat,
tail of a dragon.

00:39:30,224 --> 00:39:31,525
You're a genetic anomaly.

00:39:31,592 --> 00:39:34,228
One person,

00:39:34,295 --> 00:39:38,466
two completely different
sets of DNA.

00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:44,405
BRASS:
<i>State your name for the record.</i>

00:39:46,674 --> 00:39:48,743
My name is Todd Coombs.

00:39:48,809 --> 00:39:53,247
I raped and murdered
Emma Dobbins and Linley Parker.

00:39:53,314 --> 00:39:54,482
There are more,

00:39:54,548 --> 00:39:56,717
but we'll talk
about those later.

00:39:56,784 --> 00:39:59,020
How'd you pick your victims?

00:39:59,086 --> 00:40:01,255
They picked me.

00:40:01,322 --> 00:40:03,024
GRISSOM:
Sometimes fraternal twins,

00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:06,027
two separately fertilized eggs,
develop into only one person.

00:40:06,093 --> 00:40:10,798
<i>In effect,</i>
<i>one twin dies in embryo,</i>

00:40:10,865 --> 00:40:14,368
<i>but its DNA survives</i>
<i>in the other.</i>

00:40:14,435 --> 00:40:17,271
That's why the DNA
from his buccal swab

00:40:17,338 --> 00:40:20,007
matched his hair
but not his semen.

00:40:20,074 --> 00:40:23,878
So he had two strains
of DNA in his body.

00:40:23,944 --> 00:40:26,013
Yeah, and the DNA in his semen,

00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,782
was evidently from
his dead twin brother.

00:40:27,848 --> 00:40:30,651
You never met Emma Dobbins
or Linley Parker.

00:40:30,718 --> 00:40:33,354
I didn't have to meet 'em.

00:40:33,421 --> 00:40:35,723
You go to a bar,
you see an attractive woman,

00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:37,658
make your move,
she shoots you down.

00:40:37,725 --> 00:40:39,393
You go home, you masturbate.

00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:40,461
You get on with it.

00:40:43,731 --> 00:40:46,767
But when I see a woman
who arouses me...

00:40:50,671 --> 00:40:53,874
the whole world disappears...

00:40:53,941 --> 00:40:56,944
except for her.

00:40:57,011 --> 00:40:59,046
She can't say no.

00:41:00,247 --> 00:41:01,615
WARRICK:
<i>What a night.</i>

00:41:01,682 --> 00:41:03,117
<i>You guys hungry?</i>

00:41:03,184 --> 00:41:04,518
<i>Want to get something to eat?</i>

00:41:04,585 --> 00:41:06,620
No, I think I'm going
to call it a night.

00:41:06,687 --> 00:41:07,621
Yeah, me, too.

00:41:07,688 --> 00:41:09,790
I feel ya.
Get some rest.

00:41:09,857 --> 00:41:10,825
All right,
I'll see you.

00:41:10,891 --> 00:41:13,127
Hey, hey, Nick,
congratulations

00:41:13,194 --> 00:41:15,830
on your almost promotion.

00:41:15,896 --> 00:41:18,566
Seriously,
you deserve it.

00:41:18,632 --> 00:41:23,104
Wow. That's really
hard for you, isn't it?

00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:24,939
Yeah, it is.

00:41:29,343 --> 00:41:30,478
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

00:41:34,648 --> 00:41:36,083
Grissom.

00:41:37,518 --> 00:41:40,454
Yes.

00:41:44,392 --> 00:41:45,426
Is she all right?

00:41:45,926 --> 00:41:48,529
( <i>siren blips</i> )

00:41:48,596 --> 00:41:51,132
<i>She was lucky</i>
<i>she wasn't on the strip.</i>

00:41:51,198 --> 00:41:53,667
<i>That's Highway Patrol's</i>
<i>jurisdiction.</i>

00:41:53,734 --> 00:41:59,073
<i>She blew .09.</i>

00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,841
Technically,
she's over,

00:42:00,908 --> 00:42:03,244
but they just
lowered the limit,

00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:06,414
so we cut her a break
and didn't book her.

00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,383
But we did have to
call the supervisor.

00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:10,484
Well, thank you.

00:42:10,551 --> 00:42:12,753
I appreciate the courtesy.

00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:14,822
No problem.

00:42:33,307 --> 00:42:35,848
Come on.
I'll take you home.
