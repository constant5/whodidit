00:00:09,166 --> 00:00:11,635
( <i>screaming</i> )

00:00:19,675 --> 00:00:22,000
I don't wanna go!

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,536
Whoa! Ooh!

00:00:24,603 --> 00:00:26,104
Oh, Mommy.

00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:29,961
We're all going to die.

00:00:30,028 --> 00:00:32,664
Joey, put your
seat belt on. NOW.

00:00:36,034 --> 00:00:37,468
Hold on tight, here we go!

00:00:37,535 --> 00:00:40,071
( <i>screaming</i> )

00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,395
Okay, guys, come on.

00:01:04,462 --> 00:01:06,331
That was so fun.

00:01:06,397 --> 00:01:10,068
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Pharaoh's Fever.

00:01:10,134 --> 00:01:12,303
Buckle up. Get ready to scream.

00:01:14,806 --> 00:01:17,108
That was so awesome.

00:01:17,175 --> 00:01:20,678
Um, we'll ride it
in a minute.

00:01:20,745 --> 00:01:22,647
Um, four King Tut burgers,

00:01:22,714 --> 00:01:25,583
uh, two Nile River ice teas
and two milks.

00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,152
Milk is nasty.
Yeah.

00:01:28,219 --> 00:01:31,222
( <i>screaming</i> )

00:01:41,165 --> 00:01:44,168
( <i>sirens blaring</i> )

00:01:58,082 --> 00:02:00,018
So, Dr. Thrillseeker,

00:02:00,084 --> 00:02:02,220
you ever been
on this roller coaster?

00:02:02,286 --> 00:02:04,956
GRISSOM:
Pharaoh's Fever, yeah...

00:02:05,023 --> 00:02:08,760
but my ride ended
at the platform.

00:02:10,361 --> 00:02:11,229
What do you know?

00:02:12,764 --> 00:02:14,298
BRASS:
Six dead.

00:02:14,365 --> 00:02:17,502
Park full of eyewitnesses
saw the train

00:02:17,568 --> 00:02:20,505
fly off the tracks. 401B.

00:02:20,571 --> 00:02:21,739
Accident with injury.

00:02:21,806 --> 00:02:22,740
BRASS:
Uh-huh.

00:02:22,807 --> 00:02:24,742
GRISSOM:
It's also a 418B.

00:02:24,809 --> 00:02:27,412
A runaway?

00:02:28,446 --> 00:02:30,415
A runaway train.

Sorry we're late.

00:03:10,775 --> 00:03:13,178
There was a news van
blocking the entrance.

00:03:13,245 --> 00:03:14,980
This is the first
time a roller coaster

00:03:15,046 --> 00:03:16,848
has derailed in
Clark County.

00:03:16,915 --> 00:03:19,317
Huge criminal and civil
liabilities issues,

00:03:19,384 --> 00:03:20,685
so keep it quiet.

00:03:20,752 --> 00:03:22,387
Photograph the scene.

00:03:22,454 --> 00:03:24,990
Bag and tag all the detritus.

00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,825
Forklift anything
bigger than Greg.

00:03:26,892 --> 00:03:28,293
We're going to
put up a tent

00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,828
on the other side
of the parking lot

00:03:29,895 --> 00:03:32,564
for accident reconstruction.
Questions?

00:03:32,631 --> 00:03:37,335
Yeah. What's that guy doing
so far away from the others?

00:03:38,937 --> 00:03:41,339
Curious, isn't it?

00:03:41,406 --> 00:03:44,743
So, when he asks
if anybody has any questions,

00:03:44,809 --> 00:03:46,177
he's not really asking?

00:03:46,244 --> 00:03:50,015
Well, I don't know much
about roller coaster accidents,

00:03:50,081 --> 00:03:51,816
but in auto collisions,
the victims found

00:03:51,883 --> 00:03:53,552
furthest away from
the car usually
weren't wearing

00:03:53,618 --> 00:03:54,853
a seat belt.

00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,221
That'd be my bet.

00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:58,189
( <i>screaming</i> )

00:04:01,593 --> 00:04:04,095
STOKES:
Okay, let's go to work.

00:04:04,162 --> 00:04:05,697
What should I do?

00:04:05,764 --> 00:04:10,302
Photo-evidence log-- just record
everything we collect, okay?

00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:28,320
Couple of mountain
bikers called
in the body.

00:04:28,386 --> 00:04:30,555
Coroner just arrived.

00:04:32,591 --> 00:04:34,926
WILLOWS:
Hi, David.

00:04:34,993 --> 00:04:36,962
Hey.

00:04:37,028 --> 00:04:38,496
Tessa Press.

00:04:38,563 --> 00:04:41,066
School I.D. was
in her pocket.

00:04:41,132 --> 00:04:42,767
She's 13.

00:04:42,834 --> 00:04:45,737
I hate these cases.

00:04:45,804 --> 00:04:49,341
Now... the body position
is inconsistent

00:04:49,407 --> 00:04:50,942
with her lividity.

00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:54,713
After she died, blood settled to
her anterior and lividity fixed.

00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:56,448
So she had been facedown.

00:04:56,514 --> 00:04:57,983
Yeah.

00:04:58,049 --> 00:05:00,652
And someone dumped her face up.

00:05:00,719 --> 00:05:02,087
How long has she been here?

00:05:02,153 --> 00:05:06,358
I'll defer that question
to the insects.

00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,999
WILLOWS:
Instar maggots.

00:05:14,065 --> 00:05:15,767
Given the ambient
temperature

00:05:15,834 --> 00:05:17,469
and last night's rain,

00:05:17,535 --> 00:05:20,272
I'd estimate she's been
out here 24 hours.

00:05:20,338 --> 00:05:24,676
Takes that long
for blowfly eggs to hatch.

00:05:24,743 --> 00:05:28,413
I guess the rain would've
washed away any trace evidence:

00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,482
tire prints,
shoe impressions.

00:05:30,548 --> 00:05:32,417
Let's just hope there's
some evidence on her body.

00:05:32,484 --> 00:05:34,152
If you're going to drive
all the way out here

00:05:34,219 --> 00:05:35,654
to dump a body,

00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,789
why not take another ten minutes
and bury her?

00:05:37,856 --> 00:05:41,192
Guess it wasn't worth
the killer's time.

00:06:19,564 --> 00:06:21,566
( <i>metal screeching</i> )

00:06:34,145 --> 00:06:36,314
So, how long you been operating
the roller coaster?

00:06:36,381 --> 00:06:38,483
Couple of months.
I got a promotion.

00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:39,985
I used to work
the merry-go-round.

00:06:40,051 --> 00:06:41,887
That's a promotion, huh?

00:06:41,953 --> 00:06:44,155
Yeah. Only little
kids go on the
merry-go-round.

00:06:44,222 --> 00:06:46,558
Oh, I see. So you get to meet
girls your own age

00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:48,326
on Pharaoh's Fever.

00:06:48,393 --> 00:06:50,829
Yeah, something
like that.

00:06:50,896 --> 00:06:53,498
What kind of training
do you get to be an operator?

00:06:53,565 --> 00:06:55,834
Training? I
release the brake.

00:06:55,901 --> 00:06:57,035
I press a button.

00:06:57,102 --> 00:06:58,503
It's green and
marked "start".

00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:00,071
I get the picture.

00:07:00,138 --> 00:07:01,673
All right, look,
there are six victims.

00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:04,776
It'd be helpful to know
where each of them was sitting.

00:07:04,843 --> 00:07:06,611
Um...

00:07:06,678 --> 00:07:08,446
front bench was a girl.

00:07:08,513 --> 00:07:09,614
She was blond.

00:07:09,681 --> 00:07:11,549
Yeah?
Cute.

00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:18,356
<i>Uh, followed by a punk,</i>
<i>old folks and some other dude.</i>

00:07:20,191 --> 00:07:21,793
That's only five.

00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,429
That's all I remember.

00:07:26,831 --> 00:07:28,300
BRASS:
"See yourself
scream"?

00:07:28,366 --> 00:07:30,435
What's this about?
We got a digital camera.

00:07:30,502 --> 00:07:31,770
It's mounted
right over there.

00:07:32,837 --> 00:07:34,239
BRASS:
How does that work?

00:07:34,306 --> 00:07:35,807
Camera's on a trigger.

00:07:35,874 --> 00:07:38,143
Train passes by,
automatically
snaps a picture

00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:40,211
and stores it in the
computer's hard drive.

00:07:40,278 --> 00:07:41,646
The train was airborne.

00:07:41,713 --> 00:07:44,916
Never even got close
to the camera.

00:07:44,983 --> 00:07:47,919
I'm still going to want
to take that computer.

00:07:53,725 --> 00:07:56,461
I'm the park's
chief engineer.

00:07:56,528 --> 00:07:58,630
Been working on coasters
since before I was tall enough

00:07:58,697 --> 00:08:00,131
to ride 'em.

00:08:00,198 --> 00:08:03,401
GRISSOM:
You responsible for maintaining
this roller coaster?

00:08:03,468 --> 00:08:04,836
I keep all the rides up to code.

00:08:04,903 --> 00:08:06,938
You have any idea
what would cause this train

00:08:07,005 --> 00:08:08,240
to go off the track?

00:08:08,306 --> 00:08:10,242
Well, in theory, I didn't think
it was possible.

00:08:10,308 --> 00:08:12,477
There's never been
an accident like
this anywhere.

00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:15,013
So, you're an expert?

00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,649
On roller coasters? Hell yeah.

00:08:17,716 --> 00:08:19,618
Ten years of service
on Six Flags'

00:08:19,684 --> 00:08:21,620
American Eagle before
moving to Vegas.

00:08:21,686 --> 00:08:23,321
Do you know what that is?

00:08:23,388 --> 00:08:27,325
That's a nut. It, uh... secures
the wheel to the screw.

00:08:27,392 --> 00:08:29,794
Well, one loose screw...

00:08:29,861 --> 00:08:33,598
couldn't cause a train
to derail, could it?

00:08:33,665 --> 00:08:36,301
No, no, there's, uh...
eight wheels per train.

00:08:36,368 --> 00:08:38,370
They-they'd all have to be
loose, and, uh...

00:08:38,436 --> 00:08:40,505
that just doesn't happen.

00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,985
"There are three things
in human life

00:08:54,052 --> 00:08:55,820
"that are important.

00:08:55,887 --> 00:08:58,189
"The first is to be kind;

00:08:58,256 --> 00:09:00,926
"the second one
is to be kind;

00:09:00,992 --> 00:09:04,229
and the third one
is to be kind."

00:09:04,296 --> 00:09:05,797
Henry James.

00:09:05,864 --> 00:09:08,934
Very good. Author of one
of the greatest horror stories

00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,602
ever written:
<i>Turn of the Screw.</i>

00:09:10,669 --> 00:09:11,937
And I'm looking for one.

00:09:12,003 --> 00:09:13,471
SIDLE:
A screw?
Yes.

00:09:13,538 --> 00:09:15,340
Oh, well...

00:09:15,407 --> 00:09:17,075
technically, these
are eccentric shafts,

00:09:17,142 --> 00:09:18,643
not screws.

00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:19,978
Well, as long

00:09:20,045 --> 00:09:22,981
as you can screw a nut on it,
it's a screw.

00:09:23,048 --> 00:09:24,983
<i>Turn of the Screw</i>
isn't really a
horror story.

00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:26,084
It's more of a mystery.

00:09:26,151 --> 00:09:27,719
Did the governess
kill the little boy,

00:09:27,786 --> 00:09:28,753
or did the ghost do it?

00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:29,854
Well, it's only a mystery

00:09:29,921 --> 00:09:31,022
if you believe in ghosts.

00:09:33,491 --> 00:09:36,094
End threads are stripped.

00:09:36,161 --> 00:09:37,495
Means the nuts were loose.

00:09:37,562 --> 00:09:40,065
Excessive play on the screws
would've worn down the threads.

00:09:40,131 --> 00:09:42,934
And the nuts
would've popped off.

00:09:47,806 --> 00:09:50,442
Nuts don't just pop off
by themselves.

00:09:53,144 --> 00:09:55,847
GRISSOM:
We got tool marks.

00:09:55,914 --> 00:09:59,017
Vertical striations,
evenly spaced.

00:09:59,084 --> 00:10:01,353
Could've been a pipe wrench.

00:10:01,419 --> 00:10:03,188
Maybe whoever maintains
the roller coaster

00:10:03,255 --> 00:10:05,257
uses a pipe wrench
to tighten the nuts.

00:10:05,323 --> 00:10:09,261
Or whoever loosened the nuts
screwed up.

00:10:19,604 --> 00:10:23,842
It's Tessa.

00:10:23,909 --> 00:10:26,077
I don't understand.

00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:29,948
How could this...?

00:10:34,252 --> 00:10:36,321
My baby.

00:10:39,424 --> 00:10:42,427
I'm very sorry.

00:10:43,461 --> 00:10:46,531
She's beautiful, isn't she?

00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,902
Ma'am, the coroner

00:10:50,969 --> 00:10:52,938
believes that Tessa died

00:10:53,004 --> 00:10:54,205
over 24 hours ago.

00:10:54,272 --> 00:10:56,207
Had you reported her missing?

00:10:58,109 --> 00:11:02,614
Couple nights a week, she'd
sleep at her friend Carrie's.

00:11:02,681 --> 00:11:06,284
There's just
the two of us.

00:11:06,351 --> 00:11:09,321
I'm a waitress. Work nights.

00:11:09,387 --> 00:11:11,923
That way I can...

00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:16,061
make her breakfast and be there
when she gets home from school.

00:11:17,729 --> 00:11:20,031
When was the last time
that you saw her?

00:11:20,098 --> 00:11:22,801
Yesterday morning.

00:11:22,867 --> 00:11:26,037
I got home
around 6:00.

00:11:26,104 --> 00:11:29,975
We made pancakes.

00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:33,945
I packed her lunch
and kissed her good-bye.

00:11:37,682 --> 00:11:38,783
When she didn't

00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:40,252
come home from school,

00:11:40,318 --> 00:11:42,621
I just figured
she was at Carrie's.

00:11:45,824 --> 00:11:47,525
I should have called,

00:11:47,592 --> 00:11:51,663
but I didn't
want to be a nag.

00:11:54,065 --> 00:11:56,768
I want to see her.

00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:59,838
Officer,

00:11:59,905 --> 00:12:01,740
could you please
escort

00:12:01,806 --> 00:12:04,175
Ms. Press... to the morgue.

00:12:20,392 --> 00:12:22,794
When's the last time
you went 24 hours

00:12:22,861 --> 00:12:24,563
without talking
to Lindsey?

00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:26,498
A single mother,
working nights.

00:12:26,565 --> 00:12:27,832
I'm just saying,

00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:30,101
she didn't check
on her own kid, you know?

00:12:30,168 --> 00:12:34,539
Ah, you do the
best you can.

00:12:34,606 --> 00:12:36,608
Introductions.

00:12:38,343 --> 00:12:39,611
Shelly Hoffman, 25.

00:12:39,678 --> 00:12:40,679
Cause of death--

00:12:40,745 --> 00:12:42,514
lacerated ventricle.

00:12:42,581 --> 00:12:43,982
Noah Nuland, 15.

00:12:44,049 --> 00:12:46,218
C.O.D.-- head contusion.

00:12:46,284 --> 00:12:49,588
The swelling of the brain
killed him within minutes.

00:12:49,654 --> 00:12:52,357
Now, Gary Clodfelter

00:12:52,424 --> 00:12:53,558
died of shock.

00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,060
His wife, May,
exsanguinated.

00:12:55,126 --> 00:12:58,863
And their son, Cameron--

00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:00,699
another
head contusion.

00:13:00,765 --> 00:13:03,235
What about this guy?

00:13:03,301 --> 00:13:04,803
Jim Nevins, 20.

00:13:04,869 --> 00:13:06,304
Park employee.

00:13:06,371 --> 00:13:09,708
Died from a temporal herniation.

00:13:09,774 --> 00:13:12,310
Impact to the
head caused the
brain to swell,

00:13:12,377 --> 00:13:14,613
which, in turn,
put pressure on the brain stem.

00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:16,081
According to the ride operator,

00:13:16,147 --> 00:13:18,650
there were only five passengers
on the roller coaster,

00:13:18,717 --> 00:13:19,885
and no employees.

00:13:19,951 --> 00:13:22,053
Right.
So...

00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,624
maybe Nevins was just
an unfortunate bystander.

00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:28,760
Hit in the head
by a falling roller coaster.

00:13:28,827 --> 00:13:30,528
The Chicken Little theory?

00:13:30,595 --> 00:13:31,997
But here's the hitch.

00:13:32,063 --> 00:13:34,466
The others died
roughly ten hours ago.

00:13:34,532 --> 00:13:37,002
Mr. Nevins' rigor
mortis is fixed.

00:13:37,068 --> 00:13:39,104
Body temp
puts the time of his death

00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:41,573
approximately 16 hours
before the others--

00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,008
right around 1:00 A.M.

00:13:43,074 --> 00:13:46,244
( <i>sighing</i> )

00:13:46,311 --> 00:13:51,182
Albert... dead men
don't ride roller coasters.

00:13:56,828 --> 00:13:58,062
<i>We're going to need to see</i>

00:13:58,129 --> 00:13:59,564
the underside
of the loading platform.

00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,565
Oh, follow me.

00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:01,566
Rumor has it

00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:03,001
the park's going to shut down

00:14:03,067 --> 00:14:04,268
Pharaoh's Fever for good.

00:14:04,335 --> 00:14:05,737
You know anything
about that?

00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:07,071
GRISSOM:
No.

00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:09,574
Newspaper called it
"a death trap."

00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,275
An accident
waiting to happen.

00:14:11,342 --> 00:14:12,643
You disagree
with that?

00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:14,312
Well, she's old
and wrinkled, but

00:14:14,379 --> 00:14:16,914
I took good care of her.

00:14:20,018 --> 00:14:21,319
Uh, Woody?

00:14:22,387 --> 00:14:23,688
We'd like to be alone.

00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:26,691
Holler if you need anything.

00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:49,981
Well,

00:14:50,048 --> 00:14:51,683
easy access.

00:14:51,749 --> 00:14:54,519
Wheels are in reach.

00:14:54,585 --> 00:14:57,355
Anyone could have
loosened the nuts
from down here.

00:14:57,422 --> 00:15:00,358
Check this out.

00:15:00,425 --> 00:15:02,026
Is that lubricant,
maybe?

00:15:02,093 --> 00:15:03,361
It's a funny place
for lubricant.

00:15:03,428 --> 00:15:04,495
It's not even on the track.

00:15:04,562 --> 00:15:06,264
I'll swab it.

00:15:07,932 --> 00:15:10,635
( <i>flapping</i> )

00:15:12,904 --> 00:15:15,707
Hey, look at that.

00:15:17,275 --> 00:15:19,143
That's worse than
just a wrinkle.

00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:21,012
It's got a support
beam under it.

00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:22,613
It's just a cosmetic problem.

00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,716
Sir, you need
to step away.

00:15:24,782 --> 00:15:26,718
We need some time.

00:15:26,784 --> 00:15:29,654
This is an active
investigation.

00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:33,024
Were you aware that
that support beam was detached?

00:15:33,091 --> 00:15:34,225
Well, hell, yeah.

00:15:34,292 --> 00:15:36,194
Fixed it a half dozen times
this year.

00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,662
It's in my maintenance log.

00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:39,364
But like I said, that cross bar

00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:41,132
is supported
by the metal beam.

00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,301
But since my hours
were cut back last November,

00:15:43,368 --> 00:15:45,403
I've had to prioritize
my "fix-ums."

00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:47,705
Hmm.

00:15:47,772 --> 00:15:50,675
Woody, we'd like to requisition

00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:51,809
your pipe wrench.

00:15:51,876 --> 00:15:53,878
It's, uh, not technically mine.

00:15:53,945 --> 00:15:55,847
Are you the only one
that uses it?

00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,049
Yeah, but it's the property
of the park.

00:15:58,116 --> 00:16:00,518
Well, I promise
we'll get it back to you.

00:16:03,554 --> 00:16:04,656
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

00:16:04,722 --> 00:16:06,591
Thank you.

00:16:07,992 --> 00:16:09,494
Yeah?

00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,630
I'm processing the dead
park employee's clothing.

00:16:12,697 --> 00:16:15,667
The shirt and the pants
are covered in red fibers.

00:16:15,733 --> 00:16:17,568
GRISSOM:
Anything distinctive?

00:16:17,635 --> 00:16:21,039
Well, they're trilobal.

00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,573
Very good.

00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,875
Thanks, Nick.

00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:29,280
Well, we need to find a car
with a red interior.

00:16:29,347 --> 00:16:31,249
SARA:
Hi.

00:16:33,184 --> 00:16:35,853
The roller coaster
broke into 106 parts.

00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,889
I just logged
the final piece.

00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,257
Good work.

00:16:39,324 --> 00:16:40,925
I found something
a little unusual,

00:16:40,992 --> 00:16:42,994
for a roller coaster.

00:16:47,765 --> 00:16:49,100
Not a sailor,

00:16:49,167 --> 00:16:50,535
but a...

00:16:50,601 --> 00:16:52,103
Semen?

00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:53,971
Sex on the
roller coaster?

00:16:54,038 --> 00:16:56,240
Or some kid
shaking hands with Shorty.

00:16:58,343 --> 00:17:00,978
The release of epinephrine
and adrenaline

00:17:01,045 --> 00:17:02,146
while riding a roller coaster

00:17:02,213 --> 00:17:05,683
can produce a
stimulatory effect.

00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,919
It enhances ejaculation.

00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,587
Right.
But is it probative

00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:10,922
to our
investigation?

00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,423
Well, um,
why don't you

00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:15,259
swab a sample,
and you can tell us.

00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:18,096
Greg, do we know who the R.O.
of this T-Bird is?

00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:19,764
Uh...

00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:21,265
Jim Nevins.

00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:23,001
The dead employee.

00:17:23,067 --> 00:17:24,535
I didn't realize

00:17:24,602 --> 00:17:26,604
the cars were relevant
to our investigation.

00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:27,605
Everything's
relevant

00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:30,041
Greg, until it's not.

00:17:36,714 --> 00:17:38,449
Grissom.

00:17:43,388 --> 00:17:45,590
Take a look at this.

00:17:45,657 --> 00:17:47,759
A pipe wrench.

00:17:50,595 --> 00:17:52,430
Blood.

00:17:52,497 --> 00:17:54,899
Greg, may I?

00:18:01,773 --> 00:18:04,008
Blood pool.

00:18:04,075 --> 00:18:07,779
Camouflaged by the red carpet.

00:18:07,845 --> 00:18:10,081
That explains
the autopsy findings.

00:18:10,148 --> 00:18:13,351
Nevins may have never been in
the roller coaster.

00:18:13,418 --> 00:18:15,053
Possibly killed

00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:17,055
by that wrench
and stuffed in his own trunk.

00:18:17,121 --> 00:18:18,323
And, uh, then what?

00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:19,991
A renegade roller coaster

00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:21,959
comes along
16 hours later,

00:18:22,026 --> 00:18:24,662
and propels Nevin's body
from the trunk to the blacktop?

00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:25,997
I'm just following the evidence.

00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:28,232
I'll call Brass, see if he
can find an eyewitness

00:18:28,299 --> 00:18:30,301
that can place the car
in the parking lot

00:18:30,368 --> 00:18:31,903
at the time of Nevin's death.

00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,541
Uh, so, Woody said

00:18:36,607 --> 00:18:38,843
that I might be able to help you
with your investigation.

00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,479
Zack, you close up shop
at the Sphinx at night.

00:18:41,546 --> 00:18:42,814
Yeah, Monday to Friday.

00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,981
Uh, class till 3:00.

00:18:44,048 --> 00:18:46,551
Tutor kids in math
till 5:00, and then

00:18:46,617 --> 00:18:47,719
I head over to the park.

00:18:47,785 --> 00:18:48,853
We close at 10:00.

00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,990
Did you notice any cars
in the parking lot

00:18:52,056 --> 00:18:54,492
after closing on Thursday night?

00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,929
Jimmy Nevins.
His red T-Bird was out there.

00:18:57,996 --> 00:18:58,763
Oh, you know Jimmy?

00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:00,465
Yeah, sure; pretty cool guy.

00:19:00,531 --> 00:19:01,899
Worked the bumper cars.

00:19:01,966 --> 00:19:03,601
I still
can't believe

00:19:03,668 --> 00:19:05,169
what happened, you know?

00:19:05,236 --> 00:19:08,039
I mean, I must
have rode that
coaster, like,

00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:09,607
100 times, maybe more.

00:19:09,674 --> 00:19:12,777
Anyway, sometimes
Jimmy stayed after closing.

00:19:12,844 --> 00:19:14,212
Why?

00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:16,581
Look, I'm not trying
to get anybody in trouble,

00:19:16,647 --> 00:19:18,349
but occasionally,
Jimmy would

00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:21,519
take his... dates for rides
on The Fever, you know?

00:19:21,586 --> 00:19:23,521
Everybody knew about it.
It was really no big deal.

00:19:23,588 --> 00:19:24,622
Do you happen to know

00:19:24,689 --> 00:19:26,224
the name of his date
on Thursday night?

00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,359
No, sorry.

00:19:28,426 --> 00:19:30,461
How did Jimmy
get access to the park?

00:19:30,528 --> 00:19:33,264
I mean, all the power
is shut down at night.

00:19:33,331 --> 00:19:35,233
The same key that opens up
the men's room door

00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,035
opens up all the power boxes
at the park.

00:19:37,101 --> 00:19:38,903
No kidding.

00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:40,772
It's just hanging
outside Woody's office.

00:19:40,838 --> 00:19:42,073
What about security?

00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:45,043
Nope. Night guy got laid off.

00:19:45,109 --> 00:19:46,310
Budget cuts
last winter.

00:19:46,377 --> 00:19:49,313
It's not like anybody's going
break into an amusement park

00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,948
and steal a coaster, you know?

00:19:51,015 --> 00:19:53,284
DAVID PHILLIPS:
X-rayed Tessa's neck.

00:19:53,351 --> 00:19:55,319
Blade appears
to have perforated

00:19:55,386 --> 00:19:57,889
her fifth cervical
intervertebral disc,

00:19:57,955 --> 00:19:59,891
lacerating the spinal cord.

00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:04,629
Type of trauma suggests
we're looking at asphyxia

00:20:04,696 --> 00:20:06,631
due to diaphragmatic
paralysis.

00:20:09,634 --> 00:20:13,671
It looks like there's soil
inside of her wound.

00:20:13,738 --> 00:20:15,673
Well, we did find her outside.

00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:18,276
Right.

00:20:18,343 --> 00:20:21,879
Should be soil around the wound.

00:20:21,946 --> 00:20:23,014
And on the wound,

00:20:23,081 --> 00:20:25,016
but not inside of it.

00:20:54,579 --> 00:20:58,449
♪ ♪

00:21:37,121 --> 00:21:39,524
Oh, I am the man.

00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,726
Are you?

00:21:41,793 --> 00:21:43,628
I microsilled the pipe wrenches

00:21:43,695 --> 00:21:45,697
you and Sara
turned into evidence.

00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:48,032
I excluded
Woody's wrench.

00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:49,867
Take a look at
the tool marks

00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:51,602
from the wrench
found in the T-bird.

00:21:51,669 --> 00:21:52,870
On the left,
the sabotaged nut.

00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:53,871
On the right,

00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:55,606
the test marks.

00:21:55,673 --> 00:21:57,275
Perfect match.

00:21:57,342 --> 00:21:58,776
I have a theory.

00:21:58,843 --> 00:22:01,979
Maybe Jim Nevins
sabotaged the roller coaster.

00:22:06,818 --> 00:22:09,253
When he left the park,
someone attacked him,

00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,856
grabbed his wrench
and hit him over
the head with it.

00:22:18,429 --> 00:22:19,897
Did you any prints
off the wrench?

00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:20,999
I got a partial.

00:22:21,065 --> 00:22:22,767
And I had a tech
print the T-Bird.

00:22:22,834 --> 00:22:25,536
Found two sets of prints
on the trunk's lid.

00:22:25,603 --> 00:22:27,305
One belonged to the vic,

00:22:27,372 --> 00:22:30,641
the other unknown,
but it did match the partial.

00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:36,414
That semen
from the coaster's cab

00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:38,316
was just processed in my lab.

00:22:38,383 --> 00:22:40,651
All I can say is,
Nevins was a cad.

00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:43,454
Semen match the dead guy's?

00:22:43,521 --> 00:22:45,123
Yup. And Sara spoke to Brass,

00:22:45,189 --> 00:22:48,559
who says Nevins was known for
taking girls on private rides.

00:22:48,626 --> 00:22:50,595
Pharaoh's Fever
was his Spanish fly.

00:22:50,662 --> 00:22:53,498
Well, there goes my theory.

00:22:53,564 --> 00:22:56,501
No one tampers
with their sex machine.

00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:01,186
( <i>typing, computer beeping</i> )

00:23:01,252 --> 00:23:02,287
Multitrack digital camera

00:23:02,353 --> 00:23:03,755
snaps photos
of all the passengers.

00:23:03,821 --> 00:23:05,523
The park finally sent
over their computer,

00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:07,592
so I'm scanning through
the day of the accident.

00:23:08,417 --> 00:23:10,619
Can you go back in time,
to the night before?

00:23:10,686 --> 00:23:12,688
Yeah. Why?

00:23:12,754 --> 00:23:14,489
Jim Nevins
may have been on that coaster.

00:23:14,556 --> 00:23:16,191
I want to see
if anyone was with him.

00:23:16,258 --> 00:23:17,559
( <i>typing</i> )

00:23:17,626 --> 00:23:18,994
( <i>computer beeps</i> )

00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:25,300
Oh. So much for safe sex.

00:23:25,367 --> 00:23:27,035
Who's the girl?

00:23:27,102 --> 00:23:28,737
Reverse one more pic.

00:23:28,804 --> 00:23:30,138
( <i>typing</i> )

00:23:32,908 --> 00:23:34,610
Now, that picture's

00:23:34,676 --> 00:23:35,644
worth five bucks.

00:23:35,711 --> 00:23:39,381
Last time stamp of the night
was 12:45 a.m.

00:23:39,448 --> 00:23:41,750
Coroner placed Nevins' T.O.D
at 1:00 a.m.

00:23:41,817 --> 00:23:43,852
We need to find that girl.

00:23:47,823 --> 00:23:49,224
WILLOWS:
Hey.

00:23:49,291 --> 00:23:50,492
BROWN:
Hey.

00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,494
Got your page.
What's up?

00:23:52,561 --> 00:23:54,696
Tessa Press took the bus
to and from school,

00:23:54,763 --> 00:23:55,998
not far from here.
Mm-hmm.

00:23:56,064 --> 00:23:57,966
I showed her picture
to the mini-mart manager.

00:23:58,033 --> 00:24:00,335
She remembers seeing her
the day that she was killed.

00:24:00,402 --> 00:24:02,671
Wow.

00:24:02,738 --> 00:24:04,573
This place is crawling
with kids.

00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,841
She remembers her?

00:24:05,907 --> 00:24:07,709
She says she came
in every afternoon

00:24:07,776 --> 00:24:09,711
and bought a Little
Debbie and a soda.

00:24:09,778 --> 00:24:11,380
Have we tracked down
her friend, Carrie?

00:24:11,446 --> 00:24:13,582
Officer Ray did speak
with Carrie and her parents,

00:24:13,649 --> 00:24:15,550
and they confirmed

00:24:15,617 --> 00:24:18,053
that Tessa spent at least two
nights a week over their place.

00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,187
And was she supposed
to sleep over

00:24:19,254 --> 00:24:20,188
the day that she was killed?

00:24:20,255 --> 00:24:21,957
I don't think
they had any kind of a schedule.

00:24:22,024 --> 00:24:23,759
She would just show up,
and when she didn't,

00:24:23,825 --> 00:24:25,127
they'd assumed that
she was at home.

00:24:26,328 --> 00:24:27,529
Warrick.

00:24:27,596 --> 00:24:29,965
I've already
secured the footage.

00:24:43,712 --> 00:24:46,014
Oh, roller coaster
wacko at 12:00.

00:24:47,082 --> 00:24:49,818
I heard you were
looking for someone.

00:24:49,885 --> 00:24:51,653
Sir, do you recognize
this young woman?

00:24:53,588 --> 00:24:55,090
Oh, sure, it's Cleopatra.

00:24:56,291 --> 00:24:57,893
She works
in food services.

00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,628
Second pyramid on the left.

00:24:59,695 --> 00:25:01,897
Thank you, Woody.

00:25:10,072 --> 00:25:11,506
MAN:
Hey, can I help you?

00:25:11,573 --> 00:25:13,675
Actually, we're looking
for Cleopatra.

00:25:13,742 --> 00:25:14,843
She's on break.

00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:16,111
But can I get you anything?

00:25:17,479 --> 00:25:19,081
No, thanks.

00:25:24,419 --> 00:25:26,521
Quadratic equations?

00:25:26,588 --> 00:25:29,191
That's not easy.

00:25:29,257 --> 00:25:31,193
Glad you think so.

00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,361
I have a "D" average.

00:25:32,427 --> 00:25:33,528
If I fail the final,

00:25:33,595 --> 00:25:35,597
my family's going to Hawaii
without me.

00:25:35,664 --> 00:25:36,932
We're with the crime lab.

00:25:40,669 --> 00:25:42,638
We have some questions.

00:25:45,774 --> 00:25:49,011
I had no idea
those cameras worked at night.

00:25:49,077 --> 00:25:51,013
Is your name really Cleopatra?

00:25:51,079 --> 00:25:53,582
Lisa. Lisa Hunt.

00:25:53,649 --> 00:25:55,117
Lisa, you know your friend

00:25:55,183 --> 00:25:57,085
in this photograph is dead,
right?

00:25:57,152 --> 00:26:00,088
Right.

00:26:00,155 --> 00:26:02,124
You don't seem
too upset about that.

00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:04,159
D.L. on Jimmy Nevins:

00:26:04,226 --> 00:26:06,595
Four years ago,
when I was a frosh

00:26:06,662 --> 00:26:08,196
and he was a
senior, he was

00:26:08,263 --> 00:26:09,798
my Jordan Catalano.

00:26:09,865 --> 00:26:11,300
Know what I mean?

00:26:11,366 --> 00:26:13,568
But he didn't
know my name.

00:26:13,635 --> 00:26:15,871
So four years later,
when I started working here,

00:26:15,938 --> 00:26:17,139
he's still working here--

00:26:17,205 --> 00:26:20,475
total loser, but
still really hot--

00:26:20,542 --> 00:26:23,011
so when he asked me out,
there was only one answer:

00:26:23,078 --> 00:26:24,246
"When and where?"

00:26:24,313 --> 00:26:26,748
After hours
at the roller coaster.

00:26:26,815 --> 00:26:29,284
I know, I thought
the same thing--

00:26:29,351 --> 00:26:30,519
Cheez Whiz.

00:26:30,585 --> 00:26:32,688
But, I mean, what the hell?

00:26:32,754 --> 00:26:34,957
I'd never done it
on a roller coaster.

00:26:35,023 --> 00:26:36,959
It was your first date.

00:26:37,025 --> 00:26:39,795
You sound like my mother.

00:26:39,861 --> 00:26:42,064
Oh, God, you're not going
to tell her, are you?

00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:43,365
I just turned 18.

00:26:43,432 --> 00:26:45,167
There is nothing statutory
about it, I swear.

00:26:45,233 --> 00:26:48,203
Lisa, we need to know
what the two of you did

00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:50,005
when you got off the ride.

00:26:50,072 --> 00:26:51,373
We talked.

00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,443
I mean, not that
he had much to say.

00:26:55,677 --> 00:26:57,145
He offered to drive me home,

00:26:57,212 --> 00:26:59,247
but I only live a
few blocks from here,

00:26:59,314 --> 00:27:01,516
so I told him I'd huff it.

00:27:01,583 --> 00:27:04,653
Mm, we kissed-- way
too much slobber.

00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,488
And that was it.

00:27:06,555 --> 00:27:08,156
Was there anyone else around?

00:27:08,223 --> 00:27:11,727
I-I didn't see anybody,
but I wasn't really looking.

00:27:19,835 --> 00:27:22,704
I found Tessa.

00:27:22,771 --> 00:27:24,506
WILLOW:
Yeah, you're not
the only one.

00:27:24,573 --> 00:27:25,807
Yeah.

00:27:25,874 --> 00:27:27,309
Can you enlarge it?

00:27:27,376 --> 00:27:29,544
( <i>typing</i> )

00:27:29,611 --> 00:27:31,546
( <i>machine whirring</i> )

00:27:37,452 --> 00:27:39,521
Yeah, that's me.

00:27:39,588 --> 00:27:40,622
And who's that with you?

00:27:40,689 --> 00:27:41,857
Tessa Press.

00:27:41,923 --> 00:27:43,492
You two were friends?

00:27:43,558 --> 00:27:45,694
We sat next to each other
on the bus.

00:27:45,761 --> 00:27:47,029
She was 13.

00:27:47,095 --> 00:27:48,497
How old are you?

00:27:48,563 --> 00:27:49,665
What's that supposed
to mean?

00:27:49,731 --> 00:27:52,367
No, Mom, it's okay.

00:27:52,434 --> 00:27:54,369
I-I'm 15.

00:27:54,436 --> 00:27:56,305
I felt sorry for her.

00:27:56,371 --> 00:27:57,806
The girls picked on her.

00:27:57,873 --> 00:27:59,641
Made fun of her frizzy hair,
her old clothes.

00:27:59,708 --> 00:28:00,976
Stuff like that.

00:28:01,043 --> 00:28:03,245
She'd sit next to me,

00:28:03,312 --> 00:28:05,213
and they'd leave her alone.

00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,215
In the photo,
you're grabbing her arm.

00:28:07,282 --> 00:28:08,650
It wasn't like that.

00:28:08,717 --> 00:28:10,786
I just got my learner's permit.

00:28:10,852 --> 00:28:12,387
My mom was waiting in the car.

00:28:12,454 --> 00:28:14,289
We were just going
to get slushies.

00:28:14,356 --> 00:28:16,024
I saw Tessa in the parking lot.

00:28:16,091 --> 00:28:17,159
Hey, Tessa. Hey.

00:28:17,225 --> 00:28:18,193
Henry.

00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:20,295
You want a ride,
just door to door?

00:28:20,362 --> 00:28:22,064
No, that's okay.

00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:23,332
Oh, come on.
You're not scared

00:28:23,398 --> 00:28:24,666
to drive with me,
are you?

00:28:24,733 --> 00:28:27,302
No, it's okay. I got it.

00:28:27,369 --> 00:28:29,838
She said she was getting a ride
from someone else.

00:28:29,905 --> 00:28:31,940
Did she say who?

00:28:32,007 --> 00:28:33,342
No.

00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:37,746
But when we pulled away,
I saw her getting into a truck.

00:28:37,813 --> 00:28:39,748
I didn't see the driver.

00:28:44,252 --> 00:28:46,355
I've got a question for you.

00:28:46,421 --> 00:28:50,259
What substance contains
the following ingredients:

00:28:50,325 --> 00:28:52,527
Sorbitol, cetyl alcohol,
isopropyl myristate,

00:28:52,594 --> 00:28:55,697
glyceryl, stearate,
PEG-100 stearate,

00:28:55,764 --> 00:28:56,999
petrolatum,
benzylalcohol,

00:28:57,065 --> 00:28:58,800
titanium dioxide
and purified water?

00:28:58,867 --> 00:29:01,403
Okay, I assume that you've
identified the substance

00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:03,305
we found
on the roller coaster track?

00:29:03,372 --> 00:29:04,973
Correct.

00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,643
It's doxepin ointment.

00:29:07,709 --> 00:29:09,978
( <i>chuckles</i> ):
Sounds Klingon, huh?

00:29:11,013 --> 00:29:13,115
Anyway, uh, it's
prescribed by doctors

00:29:13,181 --> 00:29:15,284
to treat dermatological
inflammations

00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:19,154
caused by contact
with certain types of plants.

00:29:19,221 --> 00:29:20,722
Maybe whoever
messed with the tracks

00:29:20,789 --> 00:29:23,225
transferred the ointment
when they loosened the wheels.

00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,395
( <i>metallic clanking</i> )

00:29:26,461 --> 00:29:28,931
Your killer has a rash.

00:29:28,997 --> 00:29:31,600
And we need to catch it.

00:29:35,997 --> 00:29:37,432
I've been
looking for you.

00:29:37,498 --> 00:29:38,766
What's up?

00:29:38,833 --> 00:29:41,102
Hodges analyzed the trace
from inside Tessa's wound.

00:29:41,169 --> 00:29:43,604
It seems it was ZooDoo.

00:29:43,671 --> 00:29:44,772
Come again.

00:29:44,839 --> 00:29:45,940
Hoof stock.

00:29:46,007 --> 00:29:47,241
It's a combination
of feces

00:29:47,308 --> 00:29:48,776
from rhinos, zebras,
and bison.

00:29:48,843 --> 00:29:50,111
You're kidding?

00:29:50,178 --> 00:29:52,447
They say that the smell
of wild animal crap

00:29:52,513 --> 00:29:53,781
keeps the deer away.

00:29:53,848 --> 00:29:55,116
Who knew?

00:29:55,183 --> 00:29:57,952
Uh, so can we track
the source of...?

00:29:58,019 --> 00:30:01,122
There is a zoo in Auckland
that exports it.

00:30:01,189 --> 00:30:03,257
And there's only
one landscaping company

00:30:03,324 --> 00:30:05,460
in Clark County
that imports it-- ADL.

00:30:05,526 --> 00:30:07,795
I contacted ADL,
and guess what they told me?

00:30:07,862 --> 00:30:09,630
Couple of months back,

00:30:09,697 --> 00:30:12,266
they were hired
by the victim's mother.

00:30:20,041 --> 00:30:21,376
BROWN:
Hmm.

00:30:21,442 --> 00:30:22,810
ADL Landscaping.

00:30:22,877 --> 00:30:23,978
( <i>camera shutter clicks</i> )

00:30:24,045 --> 00:30:26,314
Must've been a big job--

00:30:26,381 --> 00:30:29,350
she hired them months ago.

00:30:31,152 --> 00:30:33,988
ZooDoo.

00:30:34,055 --> 00:30:35,857
( <i>camera shutter clicking</i> )

00:30:41,996 --> 00:30:43,798
Hello.

00:30:43,865 --> 00:30:44,999
Hi.

00:30:45,066 --> 00:30:46,467
I just
left you a message.

00:30:46,534 --> 00:30:48,803
Any news?

00:30:50,371 --> 00:30:53,174
Honey, these guys are
from the crime lab.

00:30:53,241 --> 00:30:54,709
Justin Mack, my boyfriend.

00:30:55,877 --> 00:30:57,111
How you doing?

00:30:57,178 --> 00:30:58,346
BROWN:
Hey.

00:30:58,413 --> 00:31:00,748
Could I have a word
with you outside for a moment?

00:31:00,815 --> 00:31:01,816
Why?

00:31:01,883 --> 00:31:02,850
Why not?

00:31:10,425 --> 00:31:13,094
May I?

00:31:13,161 --> 00:31:17,465
How can you be sure
it was Justin's truck?

00:31:17,532 --> 00:31:20,668
At this point, we're
just following a lead.

00:31:20,735 --> 00:31:24,138
How long have you known Justin?

00:31:24,205 --> 00:31:28,943
Uh... few months.

00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:31,846
Hired him to lay sod.

00:31:31,913 --> 00:31:34,482
Now we're in the midst
of an outdoor overhaul.

00:31:34,549 --> 00:31:37,151
And where's Tessa's father?

00:31:37,218 --> 00:31:38,986
L.A., maybe. I don't know.

00:31:39,053 --> 00:31:41,956
I haven't heard from him
since the divorce.

00:31:42,023 --> 00:31:44,959
He'll find a way
to blame me for this.

00:31:45,026 --> 00:31:46,561
You see, Raina said
it was important

00:31:46,627 --> 00:31:48,196
for Tessa to take
the bus to school.

00:31:48,262 --> 00:31:50,398
Said it helps
build independence.

00:31:50,465 --> 00:31:53,501
But sometimes I'd pick
her up at the bus stop,

00:31:53,568 --> 00:31:56,404
buy her an ice-cream cone,
and drop her off here.

00:31:56,471 --> 00:31:58,005
Did you pick her up
that afternoon?

00:31:58,072 --> 00:32:00,942
Look, I know there are a lot
of whack-jobs in the world,

00:32:01,008 --> 00:32:03,378
and you're just doing
your job, but watch it.

00:32:04,412 --> 00:32:06,781
You mind if I take a look
in the back of your truck?

00:32:07,815 --> 00:32:10,218
Don't you need a warrant?

00:32:10,284 --> 00:32:12,086
Only if you deny me access.

00:32:12,153 --> 00:32:13,921
Go ahead.

00:32:13,988 --> 00:32:15,523
Thanks.

00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:18,026
Have you ever left Tessa
alone with Justin?

00:32:18,092 --> 00:32:19,127
Sure.

00:32:19,193 --> 00:32:20,695
He's over here all the time.

00:32:21,729 --> 00:32:24,832
He's a good man.

00:32:24,899 --> 00:32:28,136
He wouldn't hurt anybody,
especially not Tessa.

00:32:30,405 --> 00:32:33,074
( <i>voice cracks</i> ):
Damn, I keep expecting her

00:32:33,141 --> 00:32:35,576
to walk
through that door.

00:33:09,677 --> 00:33:12,647
In 1988, your client
was arrested

00:33:12,714 --> 00:33:14,482
for a drunk and disorderly.

00:33:14,549 --> 00:33:17,852
Your fingerprints were then
entered into our database.

00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:20,655
They match the fingerprints
that we found on this shovel.

00:33:22,857 --> 00:33:25,159
WILLOWS:
The blood

00:33:25,226 --> 00:33:29,464
on the blade matches
your daughter's DNA.

00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:31,599
My client is landscaping
her backyard

00:33:31,666 --> 00:33:32,934
with her boyfriend.

00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,336
Explains her prints
on his shovel.

00:33:35,403 --> 00:33:38,139
They were the only prints
on the shovel.

00:33:38,206 --> 00:33:40,007
Justin wears work gloves.

00:33:40,074 --> 00:33:43,010
Which explains the absence
of his prints.

00:33:43,077 --> 00:33:45,046
That's possible.

00:33:45,113 --> 00:33:47,548
But your client's fingerprints
provided a sufficient basis

00:33:47,615 --> 00:33:49,817
for a warrant
to search her vehicle.

00:34:00,695 --> 00:34:03,164
The choice of weapon

00:34:03,231 --> 00:34:06,367
and the manner of disposal

00:34:06,434 --> 00:34:10,204
suggest that this was not
a premeditated murder.

00:34:14,709 --> 00:34:16,177
You can help yourself here.

00:34:16,244 --> 00:34:17,879
You can avoid

00:34:17,945 --> 00:34:20,381
Murder One by telling us
what set you off.

00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:24,852
You wouldn't understand.

00:34:24,919 --> 00:34:26,087
Try me.

00:34:26,154 --> 00:34:29,090
I bought Tessa a bus pass,

00:34:29,157 --> 00:34:30,525
and that

00:34:30,591 --> 00:34:34,429
little slut still gets my guy

00:34:34,495 --> 00:34:36,197
to pick her up
after school.

00:34:36,264 --> 00:34:38,299
Raina...
Shut up!

00:34:40,001 --> 00:34:41,836
We all know why.

00:34:41,903 --> 00:34:43,271
Why don't you tell us?

00:34:43,337 --> 00:34:46,874
She was trying
to steal him from me.

00:34:52,985 --> 00:34:55,184
Bye, thanks Justin. 

00:34:57,785 --> 00:34:59,187
What the hell

00:34:59,253 --> 00:35:00,221
were you doing with him?

00:35:00,288 --> 00:35:02,090
Mom, he just gave me
a ride home.

00:35:02,156 --> 00:35:04,058
You think you got him wrapped
around your little finger?

00:35:04,125 --> 00:35:05,860
He's just being nice, okay?

00:35:05,927 --> 00:35:07,195
Were you nice back?

00:35:07,261 --> 00:35:09,797
Don't do this again, please!

00:35:09,864 --> 00:35:11,699
You don't talk to me like that,
you little bitch.

00:35:11,766 --> 00:35:13,301
Mom, you're being ridiculous.

00:35:13,368 --> 00:35:14,635
Where the hell do you think

00:35:14,702 --> 00:35:16,804
you're going?
I've given you

00:35:16,871 --> 00:35:19,073
everything.

00:35:23,778 --> 00:35:26,414
Justin was the best thing
in my life.

00:35:27,849 --> 00:35:29,817
No.

00:35:29,884 --> 00:35:31,986
Your daughter

00:35:32,053 --> 00:35:35,156
was the best thing in your life.

00:35:37,625 --> 00:35:39,227
You didn't know her.

00:35:39,293 --> 00:35:42,030
( <i>scoffs</i> )

00:35:42,096 --> 00:35:44,832
I know she was 13 years old.

00:35:44,899 --> 00:35:47,368
A child.

00:35:50,872 --> 00:35:52,407
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:35:52,473 --> 00:35:53,908
SIDLE:
<i>I just got the court order</i>

00:35:53,975 --> 00:35:55,410
from the
pharmaceutical
database.

00:35:55,476 --> 00:35:57,845
Fortunately, Dioxipin
isn't widely prescribed.

00:35:57,912 --> 00:35:59,714
FDA only approved
it two years ago,

00:35:59,781 --> 00:36:02,483
and most dermatologists
don't even know what it is.

00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:04,686
How many names on the list?

00:36:04,752 --> 00:36:06,487
Well, in Clark County,

00:36:06,554 --> 00:36:07,822
twelve prescriptions
were filled.

00:36:07,889 --> 00:36:08,956
I cross-referenced them

00:36:09,023 --> 00:36:10,358
with the employees
from the Park,

00:36:10,425 --> 00:36:11,359
and I got a hit.

00:36:11,426 --> 00:36:12,860
You want a clue?

00:36:12,927 --> 00:36:14,662
Her death ended
the Ptolemy
dynasty's reign

00:36:14,729 --> 00:36:15,830
in Ancient Egypt,

00:36:15,897 --> 00:36:18,099
hence making her
the last Pharaoh.

00:36:18,166 --> 00:36:21,569
Ah, the lovely Cleopatra.

00:36:21,636 --> 00:36:22,870
I had a rash.

00:36:22,937 --> 00:36:24,038
So what?

00:36:24,105 --> 00:36:25,573
That's not a crime.

00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,841
I read the court order.

00:36:26,908 --> 00:36:28,743
Uh, you found trace amounts
of some ointment

00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:30,044
on the roller coaster tracks?

00:36:30,111 --> 00:36:32,080
Is that the only reason
for this conversation?

00:36:32,146 --> 00:36:35,383
Your client had a prescription
for doxepin.

00:36:38,453 --> 00:36:40,021
May we see your arms, please?

00:36:40,088 --> 00:36:41,589
Rash was on my legs.

00:36:41,656 --> 00:36:43,091
Went away days ago.

00:36:43,157 --> 00:36:44,425
You want to see?

00:36:45,293 --> 00:36:46,694
Uh, that's okay.

00:36:46,761 --> 00:36:49,063
Unless you want to argue
that my client stood on her head

00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:50,565
and held a wrench in her toes,

00:36:50,631 --> 00:36:51,866
we're done here.

00:36:51,933 --> 00:36:53,768
Do you know how
you contracted the rash, Lisa?

00:36:53,835 --> 00:36:57,739
Best guess, I was getting
some help with my homework.

00:36:57,805 --> 00:36:59,607
We were studying outside
on the grass.

00:36:59,674 --> 00:37:01,442
Took a break, went for a walk.

00:37:01,509 --> 00:37:03,911
I think I brushed up
against something.

00:37:03,978 --> 00:37:05,413
Who's we?

00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,814
My math tutor.

00:37:06,881 --> 00:37:08,449
And what's his name?

00:37:08,516 --> 00:37:10,084
Zack Lawrence.

00:37:14,155 --> 00:37:16,457
Do you know if he contracted
the rash, as well?

00:37:16,524 --> 00:37:19,827
Yeah. Actually, I gave him some
of my ointment.

00:37:23,064 --> 00:37:25,767
BRASS:
Hey, Zack.

00:37:25,833 --> 00:37:28,369
Oh, hey, guys.

00:37:28,436 --> 00:37:29,804
We spoke with Lisa.

00:37:29,871 --> 00:37:31,372
She said she gave
you some ointment

00:37:31,439 --> 00:37:33,141
for some nasty rash you have.

00:37:33,207 --> 00:37:34,675
Yeah, yeah.
SIDLE:
You know, it's illegal

00:37:34,742 --> 00:37:36,711
to use someone else's
prescription medications.

00:37:36,778 --> 00:37:38,679
Is that why you guys are here?

00:37:38,746 --> 00:37:40,615
Not exactly.

00:37:42,116 --> 00:37:44,952
Um, you guys mind if we talk
about this somewhere else?

00:37:45,019 --> 00:37:45,953
Hey, good idea.

00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,321
Why don't we
go downtown?

00:37:47,388 --> 00:37:48,489
We can talk there.

00:37:48,556 --> 00:37:50,391
Come on. Come on.

00:37:50,458 --> 00:37:52,193
All right.

00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:54,529
You coming?

00:37:54,595 --> 00:37:57,031
You know, I'm going to catch up.

00:37:57,031 --> 00:37:58,114
Okay.

00:38:24,892 --> 00:38:27,695
Yeah, it's, uh,
just a little bit of a rash.

00:38:27,762 --> 00:38:29,330
It's really no big deal.

00:38:29,397 --> 00:38:31,332
Zack, what do you have
against roller coasters?

00:38:31,399 --> 00:38:32,467
What do...?

00:38:32,533 --> 00:38:34,001
I-I don't understand.

00:38:34,068 --> 00:38:36,304
This a
fingerprint
analysis.

00:38:36,371 --> 00:38:38,005
Zack, I lifted
some fingerprints

00:38:38,072 --> 00:38:40,007
off your broom
back at the Park.

00:38:40,074 --> 00:38:41,542
Turns out, they're
a match to prints

00:38:41,609 --> 00:38:43,378
that we lifted off of
Jim Nevins' T-Bird

00:38:43,444 --> 00:38:45,279
and the wrench that
was used to kill him.

00:38:45,346 --> 00:38:47,749
Circumstantial evidence at best.

00:38:47,815 --> 00:38:49,450
I also talked
to your school principal.

00:38:49,517 --> 00:38:51,185
You're a straight "A" student,
Mathalete.

00:38:51,252 --> 00:38:52,487
Science Team.

00:38:52,553 --> 00:38:54,389
You had a full ride
to Stanford next year.

00:38:54,455 --> 00:38:56,324
You don't sound like
the kind of kid

00:38:56,391 --> 00:38:59,360
that would mess with a roller
coaster just for kicks.

00:39:01,095 --> 00:39:02,597
GRISSOM:
You're a smart
guy, Zack.

00:39:02,663 --> 00:39:04,599
So, uh...

00:39:04,665 --> 00:39:08,770
let's talk this out, logically.

00:39:08,836 --> 00:39:12,073
According
to your previous statement,

00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:14,442
when you locked up
on Thursday night,

00:39:14,509 --> 00:39:17,211
Jim Nevins' car was the only one
in the parking lot, right?

00:39:17,278 --> 00:39:19,514
Yes, sir, that's correct.

00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:21,382
And you knew he was staying
in the park

00:39:21,449 --> 00:39:22,717
to ride the roller coaster.

00:39:22,784 --> 00:39:25,453
I don't care about Jim Nevins.

00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,690
What about Lisa Hunt?

00:39:28,756 --> 00:39:31,225
You tutor her, right?

00:39:31,292 --> 00:39:33,561
Did Lisa tell you that
she had a date with Jim?

00:39:33,628 --> 00:39:35,763
No, she didn't say anything.

00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:37,765
It was all over the park.

00:39:37,832 --> 00:39:41,335
Jim was going to take Lisa
on one of his coaster dates.

00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:43,971
I asked her about it.

00:39:44,038 --> 00:39:45,573
She said it was a rumor.

00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:49,310
It seems to matter to you
that she had a date with Jim.

00:39:49,377 --> 00:39:53,481
Lady, I make $20 an hour
tutoring.

00:39:53,548 --> 00:39:54,615
Why do you think

00:39:54,682 --> 00:39:56,150
I'd take minimum wage
at The Sphinx?

00:39:56,217 --> 00:39:58,219
I'm thinking,
you want Lisa to see you

00:39:58,286 --> 00:40:00,288
away from the textbooks.

00:40:01,756 --> 00:40:03,791
We started hanging out
at breaks.

00:40:03,858 --> 00:40:05,860
Having dinner.

00:40:07,261 --> 00:40:09,197
And then last week,
after tutoring,

00:40:09,263 --> 00:40:10,732
we went for a walk.

00:40:10,798 --> 00:40:13,401
And she grabbed my hand.

00:40:13,468 --> 00:40:16,270
Did you think
that meant something?

00:40:16,337 --> 00:40:18,506
Of course.

00:40:18,573 --> 00:40:20,508
But...

00:40:20,575 --> 00:40:23,144
you didn't trust her.

00:40:24,445 --> 00:40:26,447
No. I wanted to.

00:40:39,994 --> 00:40:41,629
You tampered
with the screws.

00:40:41,696 --> 00:40:42,897
If she wasn't lying,

00:40:42,964 --> 00:40:44,532
she wouldn't be on
the roller coaster.

00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:45,867
No harm, no foul.

00:40:45,933 --> 00:40:48,102
Oh, but you see, she was lying.

00:40:48,169 --> 00:40:49,737
Uh-huh.

00:40:51,005 --> 00:40:53,775
But you didn't loosen the wheels
enough, did you?

00:40:53,841 --> 00:40:55,376
Don't answer that.

00:40:55,443 --> 00:40:58,880
So when the roller
coaster didn't derail,

00:40:58,946 --> 00:41:02,517
you took things
into your own hands.

00:41:12,226 --> 00:41:14,195
Lisa walked home.

00:41:14,262 --> 00:41:16,531
Jim walked over to his car.

00:41:22,503 --> 00:41:23,871
What I don't understand is

00:41:23,938 --> 00:41:26,140
why you didn't go back
and fix the roller coaster.

00:41:28,309 --> 00:41:30,144
Guess I just didn't think
about it.

00:41:30,211 --> 00:41:31,479
SIDLE:
You'll be
thinking

00:41:31,546 --> 00:41:32,380
about it now.

00:41:33,581 --> 00:41:35,249
And for the rest of your life.

00:41:37,952 --> 00:41:40,021
( <i>crowd chatter</i> )

00:41:41,589 --> 00:41:44,359
I should have caught
those loose screws.

00:41:44,425 --> 00:41:46,694
Used to check 'em
every morning,

00:41:46,761 --> 00:41:48,763
but since management
cut back on my hours...

00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:50,431
You're not to blame
for this, Woody.

00:41:50,498 --> 00:41:51,666
Oh, I just hope

00:41:51,733 --> 00:41:53,368
they don't blame the coaster.

00:41:53,434 --> 00:41:56,204
It may not be the Manhattan
Express at New York, New York

00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:58,139
or the Desperado in Primm,
but it-it...

00:41:58,206 --> 00:42:00,708
It still makes
grown men scream.

00:42:00,775 --> 00:42:03,778
My first week in Vegas,
I road the Desperado.

00:42:03,845 --> 00:42:05,146
My first coaster marathon.

00:42:05,213 --> 00:42:07,215
I rode that monster
for a week straight.

00:42:07,281 --> 00:42:08,383
Hmm.

00:42:08,449 --> 00:42:09,550
The Steel Phantom,

00:42:09,617 --> 00:42:10,885
Kennywood Park,
Pennsylvania--

00:42:10,952 --> 00:42:12,887
I actually hold
the marathon record there.

00:42:12,954 --> 00:42:14,122
Uh, uh.

00:42:14,188 --> 00:42:17,091
My-My favorite's still
the, um, King's Island.

00:42:17,158 --> 00:42:18,393
The Beast.

00:42:18,459 --> 00:42:19,794
Mm.

00:42:19,861 --> 00:42:22,063
I presented a paper
at an Entomology convention

00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:24,432
in Cincinnati just so
I could ride Son of Beast.

00:42:24,499 --> 00:42:26,667
Head over heels
on a wooden track.

00:42:26,734 --> 00:42:29,804
Ah. So, you prefer wood
over steel?

00:42:29,871 --> 00:42:32,640
No. Not really.

00:42:32,707 --> 00:42:34,375
For me, it's not
about the track.

00:42:34,442 --> 00:42:37,145
It's about the thrill.
