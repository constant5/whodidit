00:00:21,663 --> 00:00:23,065
( <i>thud</i> )

00:00:23,131 --> 00:00:24,600
( <i>tires screeching</i> )

00:00:26,702 --> 00:00:29,905
( <i>screaming</i> )

00:00:29,972 --> 00:00:33,108
You can breathalyze me
all you want,

00:00:33,175 --> 00:00:36,712
but the broad
came right at me, I swear.

00:00:36,778 --> 00:00:38,480
It wasn't my fault.

00:00:38,547 --> 00:00:39,882
Ooh, that's

00:00:39,948 --> 00:00:42,484
what happens when
6,000 pounds of thrust

00:00:42,551 --> 00:00:44,119
meets three
feet of hood.

00:00:44,186 --> 00:00:46,588
This was not a fair fight.

00:00:55,531 --> 00:00:57,299
Well, now, how
did she end up

00:00:57,366 --> 00:00:58,433
way over here?

00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,735
There must
be 20 feet

00:00:59,801 --> 00:01:02,471
of rubber burned
into this asphalt.

00:01:02,538 --> 00:01:05,407
She was braking hard.

00:01:05,474 --> 00:01:07,709
She definitely swerved
out of her lane.

00:01:09,945 --> 00:01:13,282
I think I may know why.

00:01:19,021 --> 00:01:21,423
What kind of animal are
we talking about here?

00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:23,959
A big one.

00:01:24,026 --> 00:01:25,894
The victim could have
clipped the animal

00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:27,329
when it ran in
front of her.

00:01:29,031 --> 00:01:31,333
Well, it can't
have gone far.

Whoa.

00:02:54,385 --> 00:02:56,687
This is incredibly detailed.

00:02:56,754 --> 00:02:59,924
Eyelashes, nostrils...

00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:01,525
Oh, yeah.

00:03:01,592 --> 00:03:02,693
That's what you see out of.

00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,328
I once dated
the Detroit

00:03:04,395 --> 00:03:06,263
Lions mascot. Off-season.

00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:09,266
Dutch was his name.

00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:11,101
The breadth
of your social experience

00:03:11,168 --> 00:03:12,570
never ceases to impress me.

00:03:16,774 --> 00:03:19,877
Dutch never had furballs,
though.

00:03:29,753 --> 00:03:31,789
Are you all right, David?

00:03:31,856 --> 00:03:34,124
It's just... disturbing.

00:03:34,191 --> 00:03:37,361
There was a big raccoon
who hosted

00:03:37,428 --> 00:03:39,363
an after-school kids
show when I was little.

00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,098
Stripey.

00:03:41,165 --> 00:03:42,399
Everybody loved him.

00:03:42,466 --> 00:03:45,202
I loved him.

00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:47,872
Stripey's brother

00:03:47,938 --> 00:03:48,873
suffered
blunt force trauma

00:03:48,939 --> 00:03:50,274
caused by a violent collision

00:03:50,341 --> 00:03:51,408
with a moving vehicle.

00:04:02,686 --> 00:04:04,722
The eternal question--

00:04:04,788 --> 00:04:06,857
why did the man
in the raccoon suit

00:04:06,924 --> 00:04:08,392
cross the road?

00:04:18,435 --> 00:04:20,871
Frozen stiff.

00:04:20,938 --> 00:04:24,074
Looks like he died
trying to get out.

00:04:24,141 --> 00:04:27,044
Trying to get to
the door, maybe.

00:04:27,111 --> 00:04:30,314
It got messy.

00:04:30,381 --> 00:04:32,650
Check out
the shotgun spatter.

00:04:32,716 --> 00:04:34,785
Single blast.

00:04:34,852 --> 00:04:36,787
Went in, went out.

00:04:36,854 --> 00:04:40,291
Ooh. This has got to be
the coldest place in Vegas.

00:04:40,357 --> 00:04:42,459
Let's go.
Vega's got the security guard.

00:04:42,526 --> 00:04:44,028
Yeah, he's not going anywhere.

00:04:51,735 --> 00:04:53,270
So, Peter,
when you checked in...

00:04:53,337 --> 00:04:54,405
Not Peter.

00:04:54,471 --> 00:04:56,006
Petey. P-E-T-E-Y.

00:04:56,073 --> 00:04:57,741
Hey, how you doing?
Good.

00:04:57,808 --> 00:05:00,110
The shooter may
have cleaned out
the machines.

00:05:00,177 --> 00:05:01,745
Those things
hold a lot of dough.

00:05:01,812 --> 00:05:02,813
Take was maybe, uh, $600.

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,915
They shot a guy
over a vending machine?

00:05:04,982 --> 00:05:06,116
So, uh, Petey,

00:05:06,183 --> 00:05:08,152
where were you when
all this went down?

00:05:08,219 --> 00:05:09,186
I was in the guard shack.

00:05:09,253 --> 00:05:10,187
Where else would I be?

00:05:10,254 --> 00:05:11,288
You tell us.

00:05:11,355 --> 00:05:12,857
If a guy walks
into a freezer,

00:05:12,923 --> 00:05:14,825
shoots a guy
and smashes

00:05:14,892 --> 00:05:16,694
six vending machines,
I think I'd hear that.

00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,863
The shack's out there.

00:05:18,929 --> 00:05:20,164
You don't make rounds?

00:05:20,231 --> 00:05:22,233
Look, I'm not supposed
to leave the premises, okay?

00:05:22,299 --> 00:05:25,636
Okay, but if you were here,
you're a suspect.

00:05:25,703 --> 00:05:28,172
Come on, man.

00:05:28,239 --> 00:05:30,541
Middle of the shift,
you're getting hungry.

00:05:30,608 --> 00:05:33,477
You figure, "Hey, I'll duck out,
grab a bite to eat."

00:05:33,544 --> 00:05:34,945
Who's going
to know, right?

00:05:35,012 --> 00:05:36,680
I was gone five minutes, tops.

00:05:36,747 --> 00:05:38,182
When?

00:05:38,249 --> 00:05:39,183
A little after 11:00.

00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,251
Grabbed a burger and came back.

00:05:40,317 --> 00:05:41,385
What kind of burger?

00:05:41,452 --> 00:05:42,853
In 'N' Out--
three blocks from here.

00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,189
I always get the In 'N' Out
Double-Double, Animal Style.

00:05:45,256 --> 00:05:46,156
That's what I get.

00:05:46,223 --> 00:05:47,191
You grill the onions?

00:05:47,258 --> 00:05:48,092
Hell, yeah.

00:05:48,158 --> 00:05:49,493
Now, that is crazy,
Petey,

00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,196
'cause you know, being
an In 'N' Out kind of guy,

00:05:52,263 --> 00:05:53,764
I know it takes
at least five minutes

00:05:53,831 --> 00:05:54,932
to grill the onions
alone.

00:05:54,999 --> 00:05:56,834
Come on, man.

00:05:56,901 --> 00:05:58,335
That time of night,
you're lucky

00:05:58,402 --> 00:05:59,670
if you don't wait
20 minutes

00:05:59,737 --> 00:06:01,005
just to get to the window.

00:06:04,308 --> 00:06:05,409
Look, my boss
finds out

00:06:05,476 --> 00:06:07,645
I'm leaving the site
every night to get my burger on,

00:06:07,711 --> 00:06:08,712
I'm toast.

00:06:08,779 --> 00:06:09,880
You keep lying to us,

00:06:09,947 --> 00:06:11,582
you're going
to be toast in a jumpsuit.

00:06:13,984 --> 00:06:15,786
Around 11:00,
this cat George--

00:06:15,853 --> 00:06:17,254
he usually works days--

00:06:17,321 --> 00:06:19,356
drives up and asks me
where Al is.

00:06:19,423 --> 00:06:21,859
Al Sesto?
The guy in the freezer?

00:06:21,926 --> 00:06:23,127
I told him he was back here.

00:06:23,194 --> 00:06:24,628
I came back.
Everything was quiet.

00:06:24,695 --> 00:06:26,096
So I ate my dinner in my shack.

00:06:26,163 --> 00:06:27,932
Where'd George go?

00:06:27,998 --> 00:06:30,201
Beats me. His car's
still in the parking lot.

00:06:30,267 --> 00:06:31,302
Want to show me which one?

00:06:31,368 --> 00:06:34,438
Sure.

00:06:34,505 --> 00:06:37,074
Unless he was slick,
the guy that did this

00:06:37,141 --> 00:06:39,076
definitely left behind a print,

00:06:39,143 --> 00:06:41,946
and, frankly,
nothing about this looks slick.

00:06:42,012 --> 00:06:43,614
Linda Jones, 35, single.

00:06:43,681 --> 00:06:46,584
We're trying to track
down the next-of-kin.

00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:49,119
No mystery in cause
of death, though.

00:06:49,186 --> 00:06:50,788
Your basic
massive internal trauma.

00:06:50,855 --> 00:06:51,956
And then some.

00:06:52,022 --> 00:06:54,124
Anything unusual
about our furry friend?

00:06:54,191 --> 00:06:56,060
We're about to find out.

00:07:08,239 --> 00:07:11,742
Did you know that raccoons
have opposable thumbs?

00:07:11,809 --> 00:07:14,745
Well, this one liked
to wrap his around a bottle.

00:07:14,812 --> 00:07:16,814
"30 days: One Day at a Time."

00:07:16,881 --> 00:07:18,182
He was a friend of Bill W.'s.

00:07:19,984 --> 00:07:22,019
I'll send the blood work
down to Tox.

00:07:22,086 --> 00:07:24,088
Oh, my--

00:07:24,154 --> 00:07:26,123
hand stitching.

00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:28,158
Lining looks
like some kind of latex.

00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:39,036
GRISSOM:
Whoa. That's
a lot of blood

00:07:39,103 --> 00:07:40,938
for blunt force trauma.

00:07:41,005 --> 00:07:42,406
This isn't a costume.

00:07:42,473 --> 00:07:44,041
It's a six-foot condom.

00:07:44,108 --> 00:07:46,644
Explains why there was no blood
on the road.

00:07:48,212 --> 00:07:51,382
Yeah, his tailor
didn't think of everything.

00:07:51,448 --> 00:07:53,217
His suit's not bulletproof.

00:07:54,585 --> 00:07:55,986
Shall we?

00:08:04,395 --> 00:08:05,696
Through and through.

00:08:05,763 --> 00:08:07,731
It's a high-velocity round.

00:08:07,798 --> 00:08:09,867
Gives the bullet
a smooth entry in and out.

00:08:09,934 --> 00:08:12,469
So, he was shot
and hit by a car.

00:08:12,536 --> 00:08:13,537
Bad night.

00:08:13,604 --> 00:08:15,539
Even for a raccoon.

00:08:15,606 --> 00:08:17,675
The last time
this happened

00:08:17,741 --> 00:08:20,144
they tried to
chop the guy out.

00:08:20,211 --> 00:08:22,913
1989-- year the
Mirage opened.

00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,081
How'd it go?

00:08:24,148 --> 00:08:26,083
Lost an arm and a leg.

00:08:27,251 --> 00:08:29,420
I miss the cold weather.

00:08:29,486 --> 00:08:32,389
So, what are we going to use,
hot water?

00:08:32,456 --> 00:08:33,691
Boiling works best.

00:08:33,757 --> 00:08:36,093
Just, uh, spread it
around the perimeter.

00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,428
Melt the ice.

00:08:37,494 --> 00:08:39,230
Guys, let's
do it here.

00:08:41,465 --> 00:08:42,733
To preserve the body?

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,901
That's right.

00:08:43,968 --> 00:08:47,605
Close as you can.

00:09:01,418 --> 00:09:03,420
All right, guys, let's go.

00:10:18,929 --> 00:10:20,764
Hi, Warrick.
Hey.

00:10:20,831 --> 00:10:22,366
Anything on Mr. Raccoon?

00:10:22,433 --> 00:10:23,667
Yeah.

00:10:23,734 --> 00:10:25,903
I got an AFIS hit.

00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:27,438
Robert Pitt.

00:10:27,504 --> 00:10:29,607
Court-ordered to AA
after a DUI.

00:10:29,673 --> 00:10:32,643
Oh, that explains
the 30-day chip.

00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:36,647
Maybe he fell off the
wagon after he hit 31.

00:10:36,714 --> 00:10:39,450
If I had to walk around
dressed like Rocky Raccoon,

00:10:39,517 --> 00:10:40,684
I'd be drinking, too.

00:10:40,751 --> 00:10:42,453
I don't get this whole thing.

00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,854
Oh, hey, Warrick, it's Vegas.

00:10:43,921 --> 00:10:45,356
People come here to be animals.

00:10:45,422 --> 00:10:46,357
I hear you.

00:10:46,423 --> 00:10:47,525
Take a look at this.

00:10:48,826 --> 00:10:50,895
Oh, yes, the blue fur

00:10:50,961 --> 00:10:51,996
in the vomit.

00:10:52,062 --> 00:10:53,664
Yeah, it's synthetic,
not natural.

00:10:53,731 --> 00:10:56,333
Your manimal died sober.

00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,335
No alcohol.

00:10:58,402 --> 00:10:59,403
Really?

00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,671
All this schmohawk

00:11:00,738 --> 00:11:01,872
had in his system

00:11:01,939 --> 00:11:03,841
was trace amounts of ipecac
and civet oil,

00:11:03,908 --> 00:11:05,576
which, if you ask me,
is even weirder

00:11:05,643 --> 00:11:07,344
than the raccoon suit
he was wearing.

00:11:07,411 --> 00:11:09,847
Well, ipecac's an emetic.

00:11:09,914 --> 00:11:11,415
I once gave it to Lindsey

00:11:11,482 --> 00:11:14,251
when she swallowed mothballs,
but civet oil?

00:11:14,318 --> 00:11:15,819
Yeah. Civet's a wild cat.

00:11:15,886 --> 00:11:18,556
Its scent has been prized
since the pharaohs

00:11:18,622 --> 00:11:20,224
for being an aphrodisiac.

00:11:31,001 --> 00:11:33,137
Pitt was a computer programmer.

00:11:33,204 --> 00:11:34,238
No next-of-kin.

00:11:34,305 --> 00:11:35,839
Ooh.

00:11:35,906 --> 00:11:38,842
Not an <i>Architectural</i>
<i>Digestreader.</i>

00:11:38,909 --> 00:11:40,544
( <i>chuckles softly</i> )

00:11:45,082 --> 00:11:46,417
If you want to know

00:11:46,483 --> 00:11:48,853
what the man
really is all about,

00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:50,588
check out his bedroom.

00:11:57,428 --> 00:11:59,129
Now, this scares me.

00:11:59,196 --> 00:12:00,998
A man lives alone.

00:12:01,065 --> 00:12:02,766
Has no relatives.

00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:04,368
No attachments.

00:12:04,435 --> 00:12:10,107
So, he forms his own
furry little family.

00:12:15,513 --> 00:12:17,414
"PAF Con meeting."

00:12:17,481 --> 00:12:18,549
What's PAF Con?

00:12:18,616 --> 00:12:21,051
I don't know,
but whatever it is,

00:12:21,118 --> 00:12:23,120
it's still going on.

00:12:23,187 --> 00:12:26,257
Minus one raccoon.

00:12:34,831 --> 00:12:36,966
PAF Con?

00:12:37,033 --> 00:12:39,168
The Plushies and
Furries Convention.

00:12:39,235 --> 00:12:42,171
And we're looking for
a bright blue plushy, I think.

00:12:49,312 --> 00:12:51,247
This is fascinating.

00:12:51,314 --> 00:12:53,282
A whole tribe of people...

00:12:53,349 --> 00:12:56,119
...who prefer to interact
as furry animals

00:12:56,185 --> 00:12:58,755
rather than human beings.

00:12:58,821 --> 00:13:00,857
I think I'm having

00:13:00,923 --> 00:13:02,492
Hunter Thompson's
flashbacks.

00:13:02,558 --> 00:13:05,628
This is weirding me out.

00:13:05,695 --> 00:13:06,796
It's not that weird.

00:13:06,863 --> 00:13:07,964
It's instinctual.

00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,699
Many Native
American tribes

00:13:09,766 --> 00:13:12,034
wore entire bearskins,
including the bead,

00:13:12,101 --> 00:13:14,103
when they performed
their war dances.

00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:16,205
They thought it
made them brave.

00:13:16,272 --> 00:13:18,908
I'm not getting
the brave thing.

00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:20,176
Well, think of

00:13:20,243 --> 00:13:22,044
stuffed animals as
a Jungian archetype.

00:13:22,111 --> 00:13:23,746
What's the one
quality they possess

00:13:23,813 --> 00:13:25,515
that a man like Bob
Pitt might want?

00:13:25,581 --> 00:13:27,617
A full head of hair?

00:13:27,683 --> 00:13:30,520
They're lovable.

00:13:30,586 --> 00:13:33,189
We better divide
and mingle.

00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:36,159
I'm going to take in

00:13:36,225 --> 00:13:38,227
a lecture.

00:13:40,096 --> 00:13:41,364
SIDLE:
Uh, why did you page us?

00:13:41,431 --> 00:13:42,832
Your wood sample
from the freezer.

00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:43,866
The one we gave Hodges?

00:13:43,933 --> 00:13:45,268
Yeah. He bounced
it back to me.

00:13:45,334 --> 00:13:46,369
I'm lost.

00:13:46,436 --> 00:13:47,470
It's from a
shotgun stock.

00:13:47,537 --> 00:13:48,738
Probably a
Mossberg 500.

00:13:48,805 --> 00:13:50,039
Probably our murder weapon.

00:13:50,106 --> 00:13:52,208
Well, if you find
it, I can match it.

00:13:52,275 --> 00:13:53,910
Till we do, anything else?

00:13:53,976 --> 00:13:55,812
That's up to Hodges.

00:13:55,878 --> 00:13:58,581
HODGES:
The gray stuff--
it's adhesive.

00:13:58,648 --> 00:13:59,916
On the gun stock?

00:13:59,982 --> 00:14:01,451
Cheap repair.

00:14:02,485 --> 00:14:03,486
So,

00:14:03,553 --> 00:14:05,354
some budget-minded
garage gunsmith

00:14:05,421 --> 00:14:07,156
glues his gun stock together...

00:14:07,223 --> 00:14:10,359
And then kills Al Sesto
for $600 in change.

00:14:10,426 --> 00:14:12,662
Even Petey can do better
than that.

00:14:12,728 --> 00:14:14,730
There's always
the elusive "George."

00:14:24,073 --> 00:14:26,542
Can I help you, sir?

00:14:26,609 --> 00:14:28,411
Yeah, I want to report a crime.

00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,116
Let's start with
what you were doing

00:14:33,182 --> 00:14:35,084
at Big &amp; Best Warehouse, George.

00:14:35,151 --> 00:14:36,252
You're the day guy.

00:14:36,319 --> 00:14:38,020
It was the night shift there.

00:14:38,087 --> 00:14:40,189
Expired ice cream.

00:14:40,256 --> 00:14:41,591
Trash for cash.

00:14:41,657 --> 00:14:43,292
You're selling expired
ice cream?

00:14:43,359 --> 00:14:44,427
It's still good.

00:14:44,494 --> 00:14:45,461
Oh.

00:14:45,528 --> 00:14:47,697
Go on, please.

00:14:47,764 --> 00:14:49,732
I wanted to give Al
his piece of the action,

00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:51,067
88 bucks.

00:14:51,134 --> 00:14:53,369
We, uh, walked into
the break room, and

00:14:53,436 --> 00:14:55,571
someone was smashing
up the candy machine.

00:14:58,541 --> 00:14:59,809
Ski mask?

00:14:59,876 --> 00:15:00,777
Yeah.

00:15:00,843 --> 00:15:02,578
And he had a gun.

00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,981
Better chill, bro.
Okay.

00:15:05,615 --> 00:15:06,783
Get back.
Don't shoot!

00:15:06,849 --> 00:15:07,850
Shut up!
Don't shoot.

00:15:08,684 --> 00:15:09,619
( <i>gunshot</i> )

00:15:09,685 --> 00:15:11,821
He shot Al.

00:15:11,888 --> 00:15:14,557
Then the guy hauls off
and brains me.

00:15:14,624 --> 00:15:17,927
And after that,
everything went black.

00:15:17,994 --> 00:15:19,462
Everything went black?

00:15:19,529 --> 00:15:21,130
SIDLE:
That's a pretty

00:15:21,197 --> 00:15:22,298
nasty bruise.

00:15:22,365 --> 00:15:23,299
Yeah, I told you.

00:15:23,366 --> 00:15:24,367
VEGA:
So,

00:15:24,434 --> 00:15:25,368
you blacked out.

00:15:25,435 --> 00:15:26,536
Then what happened?

00:15:26,602 --> 00:15:28,471
I was blindfolded,

00:15:28,538 --> 00:15:31,340
shoved into the
trunk of some
car and, uh,

00:15:31,407 --> 00:15:33,743
drove around for almost an hour.

00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:35,478
It, uh, glows
in the dark.

00:15:35,545 --> 00:15:36,712
Oh, yeah.

00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,315
Hmm.
STOKES:
So, uh,

00:15:39,382 --> 00:15:41,050
now, how did you get out?

00:15:41,117 --> 00:15:42,118
Tire iron.

00:15:42,185 --> 00:15:43,252
I felt around in the dark,

00:15:43,319 --> 00:15:45,088
and, uh,
there it was.

00:15:45,154 --> 00:15:46,255
STOKES:
Where?

00:15:46,322 --> 00:15:48,357
Under the, uh,
the trunk liner.

00:15:48,424 --> 00:15:50,259
I had to really twist
to get at it.

00:15:50,326 --> 00:15:51,861
Which hand did you use?

00:15:51,928 --> 00:15:53,329
Right.

00:15:53,396 --> 00:15:55,098
VEGA:
And then what?

00:15:55,164 --> 00:15:56,666
I popped the trunk.

00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,502
( <i>metal clanking</i> )

00:16:02,505 --> 00:16:04,207
I-I was in Pahrump.

00:16:04,273 --> 00:16:05,775
I got family out there, but

00:16:05,842 --> 00:16:07,577
nobody was home.

00:16:07,643 --> 00:16:09,412
All right, MacGyver,
could you do me a favor?

00:16:09,479 --> 00:16:11,214
Could you stand up
and hold your arms out?

00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,883
I'm just going
to check you out here.

00:16:20,356 --> 00:16:21,824
( <i>soft chuckle</i> )

00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,895
I'm ticklish.

00:16:25,962 --> 00:16:27,296
Oh.

00:16:35,772 --> 00:16:38,808
George...

00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:41,377
I'm afraid you
and your pants are going

00:16:41,444 --> 00:16:43,012
to be here for a while.

00:16:44,981 --> 00:16:49,685
In <i>The Eight Ages of Man,</i>
Erikson states

00:16:49,752 --> 00:16:55,525
that the child often indulges
in fantasies of being a tiger,

00:16:55,591 --> 00:16:59,128
but in his dream,
runs in terror

00:16:59,195 --> 00:17:01,130
for dear life,

00:17:01,197 --> 00:17:05,435
thus leaving the child
forever divided in himself,

00:17:05,501 --> 00:17:10,306
as his true potential
is squashed

00:17:10,373 --> 00:17:13,309
by the observing superego
of society.

00:17:14,377 --> 00:17:17,246
Birth is-is not destiny.

00:17:17,313 --> 00:17:22,418
And a human form doesn't
always come with a human spirit.

00:17:22,485 --> 00:17:23,786
We gather here

00:17:23,853 --> 00:17:26,322
to embrace our inner animal,

00:17:26,389 --> 00:17:29,625
and to bring our true nature
to bear.

00:17:29,692 --> 00:17:31,527
So to speak.

00:17:32,562 --> 00:17:34,430
Five-minute break.

00:17:34,497 --> 00:17:36,399
( <i>applause</i> )

00:17:36,466 --> 00:17:41,037
Excuse me. Do you recognize
this man, Robert Pitt?

00:17:43,239 --> 00:17:45,141
Oh.

00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:46,676
Hello, guys.

00:17:46,743 --> 00:17:47,877
Pardon me.

00:17:47,944 --> 00:17:49,679
Uh, can you help me out here?

00:17:49,746 --> 00:17:52,281
Do you recognize this guy?

00:17:52,348 --> 00:17:54,150
Look-look again.

00:17:54,217 --> 00:17:55,518
Uh-uh.

00:17:55,585 --> 00:17:56,719
Hmm.

00:17:56,786 --> 00:17:58,855
Nice dog.

00:18:21,878 --> 00:18:23,880
There you go.

00:18:53,915 --> 00:18:55,683
I'm Catherine Willows.

00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,018
I'm with the Crime Lab.

00:18:57,084 --> 00:18:59,720
( <i>hissing</i> )

00:19:10,598 --> 00:19:12,700
GRISSOM:
I guess we're lucky
that blue's not a more

00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,635
popular color.
Wait.

00:19:14,702 --> 00:19:16,838
This is racial profiling.

00:19:16,904 --> 00:19:19,874
Um, we're going
to need samples

00:19:19,941 --> 00:19:22,410
of your fur.

00:19:22,476 --> 00:19:23,544
We're also going to need

00:19:23,611 --> 00:19:25,279
to talk to you
without the masks on.

00:19:28,716 --> 00:19:30,918
Uh-uh.

00:19:30,985 --> 00:19:32,787
You have a problem with that?

00:19:32,854 --> 00:19:35,389
You wouldn't ask a human lady
to take her makeup off.

00:19:35,456 --> 00:19:37,558
If you want
to talk to me,

00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:40,194
this is the me
you're going to talk to.

00:20:03,017 --> 00:20:05,119
Take this chair right here.

00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,019
Do you a have a name,
Miss, uh...?

00:20:11,086 --> 00:20:12,787
My friends call me Sexy.

00:20:12,854 --> 00:20:14,022
Oh, lucky you.

00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:16,358
Now, do you want some help
with the... your helmet?

00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:17,926
I'm a lawyer.

00:20:17,993 --> 00:20:19,194
I know my rights.

00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:20,629
You can't sequester

00:20:20,695 --> 00:20:23,098
a domestic animal
without due cause.

00:20:23,164 --> 00:20:24,933
Well, it's coming off
one way or the other, so...

00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,768
Fine, fine.

00:20:34,309 --> 00:20:35,510
Hello,

00:20:35,577 --> 00:20:37,646
Sexy.

00:20:37,712 --> 00:20:39,981
Okay. Happy now?

00:20:40,048 --> 00:20:41,216
Thrilled.

00:20:41,283 --> 00:20:42,918
Let's start
at the top.

00:20:42,984 --> 00:20:45,020
What's your
human name, sir?

00:20:45,086 --> 00:20:47,222
Bud. Bud Simmons.

00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:48,390
But I'm no criminal,

00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:50,458
and I don't have to talk
to you people.

00:20:51,526 --> 00:20:53,495
You have a very
musky odor, Bud.

00:20:53,562 --> 00:20:55,730
Quite stimulating,

00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:57,632
I imagine.

00:21:00,435 --> 00:21:03,204
Look, we found
blue fibers

00:21:03,271 --> 00:21:05,740
similar to the ones
on your costume

00:21:05,807 --> 00:21:07,876
in the stomach
of a dead man.

00:21:07,943 --> 00:21:09,211
Bob Pitt.

00:21:09,277 --> 00:21:10,278
Huh?

00:21:10,345 --> 00:21:13,048
You may know him
as Rocky Raccoon?

00:21:13,114 --> 00:21:17,652
You think
my costume killed Rocky?

00:21:17,719 --> 00:21:20,355
We think
it may have incapacitated him.

00:21:20,422 --> 00:21:22,357
Rocky was...

00:21:22,424 --> 00:21:24,292
skritching me.

00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:25,961
That's one I haven't heard.

00:21:26,027 --> 00:21:28,296
Skritching is like grooming.

00:21:28,363 --> 00:21:31,199
It's friendly scratching.

00:21:31,266 --> 00:21:33,635
People who don't know each other

00:21:33,702 --> 00:21:36,504
can't just nuzzle
and trade tummy-rubs,

00:21:36,571 --> 00:21:40,108
but for animals,
skritching is perfectly normal.

00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:43,211
Well, killing is
perfectly normal for them, too.

00:21:43,278 --> 00:21:45,413
It doesn't make it legal
for you.

00:21:52,888 --> 00:21:55,757
Well, clearly, this
kitty costume is

00:21:55,824 --> 00:21:58,927
where Bud felt safe
enough to skritch.

00:21:58,994 --> 00:22:01,897
I wonder if he also
felt safe enough

00:22:01,963 --> 00:22:03,899
to explore some of the more...

00:22:03,965 --> 00:22:06,034
aggressive aspects
of his animus.

00:22:06,101 --> 00:22:09,838
So, if we follow the ipecac
and civet oil,

00:22:09,905 --> 00:22:12,007
maybe it'll lead us
to the shooter.

00:22:14,075 --> 00:22:16,745
I don't see a compartment
for a concealed rifle.

00:22:16,811 --> 00:22:18,446
( <i>soft chuckle</i> )

00:22:18,513 --> 00:22:20,615
( <i>whirring</i> )

00:22:46,241 --> 00:22:49,911
Okay, well... I've heard
of some guys getting off

00:22:49,978 --> 00:22:53,248
in some weird ways,
but humping

00:22:53,315 --> 00:22:55,250
an animal suit?

00:22:55,317 --> 00:22:57,719
Well, whatever happened
to normal sex?

00:22:57,786 --> 00:22:59,454
What is normal sex?

00:22:59,521 --> 00:23:02,624
Uh, you think it's natural
for a grown human

00:23:02,691 --> 00:23:06,394
to only be intimate
with a talking animal?

00:23:06,461 --> 00:23:08,730
Well, Freud said that the only
unnatural sexual behavior

00:23:08,797 --> 00:23:09,764
was to have none at all.

00:23:09,831 --> 00:23:11,566
And after that,
it's just a question

00:23:11,633 --> 00:23:13,068
of opportunity
and preference.

00:23:13,134 --> 00:23:14,269
And evidently,

00:23:14,336 --> 00:23:16,271
many prefer the feel of fur

00:23:16,338 --> 00:23:18,473
to the texture of human skin.

00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,475
Well, I like hairy chests,

00:23:20,542 --> 00:23:23,945
but I'm not about
to bop a six-foot weasel.

00:23:24,012 --> 00:23:26,314
Bud is starting

00:23:26,381 --> 00:23:27,716
to look like
a pretty

00:23:27,782 --> 00:23:29,851
bad cat.

00:23:29,918 --> 00:23:32,254
Trace from
his costume.

00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,689
Well, identical to the trace

00:23:34,756 --> 00:23:36,491
we found
in Rocky Raccoon's vomit.

00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:39,027
Ipecac and civet oil.

00:23:39,094 --> 00:23:41,396
Well, that's what you get
for eating...

00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:50,869
What kind of
a knucklehead
rolls into PD

00:23:50,936 --> 00:23:53,004
wearing pants
with blood on them?

00:23:53,071 --> 00:23:54,339
The kind
that knows eventually,

00:23:54,406 --> 00:23:56,174
the cops are going
to want to talk to him.

00:23:56,241 --> 00:23:57,943
Yeah.

00:23:58,009 --> 00:23:59,778
Preemptive strike, huh?

00:23:59,845 --> 00:24:01,346
There's only one drop here,

00:24:01,413 --> 00:24:03,915
and it originated
on the inside of the cuff.

00:24:03,982 --> 00:24:06,852
I don't think George knew
he had blood on him.

00:24:07,886 --> 00:24:09,488
We need to get this
to Greg.

00:24:09,554 --> 00:24:10,889
I was in that freezer.

00:24:10,956 --> 00:24:12,958
Man, there was spatter
everywhere.

00:24:13,024 --> 00:24:15,227
Now, assuming
that is Al's blood,

00:24:15,293 --> 00:24:19,131
how does George not get it
on the outside of his pants?

00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,769
Do you think George
is telling the truth?

00:24:26,805 --> 00:24:28,073
SIDLE:
Room temperature:

00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,541
72 degrees.

00:24:29,608 --> 00:24:31,276
STOKES:
Okay...

00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:34,379
...fire in the hole.

00:24:43,755 --> 00:24:45,323
That's what blood spatter
looks like

00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:46,491
at room temperature.

00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:48,660
Now for the good stuff.

00:24:48,727 --> 00:24:51,496
Changing one variable.

00:24:51,563 --> 00:24:55,067
Dropping temperature
to 22 degrees.

00:25:07,779 --> 00:25:09,081
That explains how only

00:25:09,147 --> 00:25:11,550
one drop of blood got on
the inside of George's pants.

00:25:11,616 --> 00:25:12,551
( <i>gunshot</i> )

00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:21,727
When he left the freezer,
the drop melted.

00:25:21,793 --> 00:25:23,695
Shooter was standing
in front of Al.

00:25:23,762 --> 00:25:25,764
A spatter went back
and to the sides.

00:25:25,831 --> 00:25:28,734
George is not the shooter.

00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:32,304
So, who is
the masked man?

00:25:32,371 --> 00:25:34,306
Well, Lone Ranger had Tonto.

00:25:34,373 --> 00:25:35,874
Some doofus has George.

00:25:36,875 --> 00:25:38,810
Tape lifts
from your suspect's clothing,

00:25:38,877 --> 00:25:40,145
loaded with paint chips.

00:25:40,212 --> 00:25:41,146
What kind?

00:25:41,213 --> 00:25:42,481
Dual layers.

00:25:42,547 --> 00:25:44,449
The bottom one's burgundy
vehicle paint.

00:25:44,516 --> 00:25:47,619
Factory pigment
used on 1984 Monte Carlo.

00:25:47,686 --> 00:25:48,920
What's the top layer?

00:25:48,987 --> 00:25:50,422
In an unprecedented move,

00:25:50,489 --> 00:25:53,458
whoever it was painted
over the burgundy with...

00:25:54,826 --> 00:25:55,827
Want to venture a guess?

00:25:57,195 --> 00:25:59,765
Bright blue house paint.

00:25:59,831 --> 00:26:01,099
Doofus.

00:26:01,166 --> 00:26:02,834
Why would somebody
use house paint on a car?

00:26:02,901 --> 00:26:04,536
Maybe he remodeled
the breakfast nook

00:26:04,603 --> 00:26:06,138
and had some left over.
Who knows?

00:26:06,204 --> 00:26:08,440
I don't try to figure out
what people do anymore.

00:26:08,507 --> 00:26:09,441
That's smart.

00:26:09,508 --> 00:26:11,143
Yeah, I know.

00:26:11,209 --> 00:26:13,111
Oil and water.

00:26:13,178 --> 00:26:15,614
Love to be there when
his hood starts to peel.

00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,115
Okay, first things first.

00:26:17,182 --> 00:26:19,551
Let's go find the car.

00:26:19,618 --> 00:26:22,054
BRASS:
Okay, Bud, I'm going
to get right to it.

00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:25,123
Bob Pitt's semen was found
all over your kitty costume.

00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:26,825
You lied to us.

00:26:26,892 --> 00:26:29,227
You were doing a little more
than grooming.

00:26:31,263 --> 00:26:34,433
It started as a skritch,
then everyone got in a furpile

00:26:34,499 --> 00:26:36,702
and pretty soon,
we were all yiffing.

00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:44,576
I get "furpile."

00:26:44,643 --> 00:26:47,012
Define "yiffing."

00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:48,647
In a furpile,

00:26:48,714 --> 00:26:54,319
when all the animals
start rubbing and wiggling,

00:26:54,386 --> 00:26:56,321
some of them start to do things.

00:27:10,936 --> 00:27:14,239
The kind of things
that leave semen on your fur?

00:27:14,306 --> 00:27:15,440
That never happened before.

00:27:15,507 --> 00:27:17,209
( <i>chuckles wryly</i> )

00:27:17,275 --> 00:27:18,176
Okay.

00:27:18,243 --> 00:27:20,612
That happened before.

00:27:20,679 --> 00:27:21,913
I know what you're thinking.

00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:22,881
You couldn't possibly.

00:27:22,948 --> 00:27:24,316
I didn't kill Rocky Raccoon.

00:27:24,383 --> 00:27:25,650
Did you smear
ipecac and civet oil

00:27:25,717 --> 00:27:26,818
on the back of your costume?

00:27:26,885 --> 00:27:28,120
That's crazy.

00:27:28,186 --> 00:27:29,921
I was there for the yiffing,
and that's all.

00:27:29,988 --> 00:27:32,057
Look, if I don't
have my costume on,

00:27:32,124 --> 00:27:35,827
I pretty much can't get yiffed.

00:27:35,894 --> 00:27:37,763
Okay, Bud.

00:27:37,829 --> 00:27:41,433
We're going to leave you
some time to think about it.

00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,636
Enjoy your new costume.

00:27:44,703 --> 00:27:46,705
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:27:51,209 --> 00:27:53,145
Are you buying
this guy?

00:27:53,211 --> 00:27:56,748
Oh, who the hell knows
what goes on in a furpile?

00:27:56,815 --> 00:27:59,351
But if somebody doused their
special scent on Kitty's back,

00:27:59,418 --> 00:28:01,420
I'm sure he's going to
want to know who did it.

00:28:01,486 --> 00:28:04,156
Well, he gives us
all the furnames
of people in the pile.

00:28:04,222 --> 00:28:06,925
What are we going to do--
put out an APB on Tom and Jerry?

00:28:06,992 --> 00:28:09,995
Maybe we just ask him
where the hip, young

00:28:10,062 --> 00:28:12,664
plushy-on-the-go
likes to hang out?

00:28:37,155 --> 00:28:38,557
Password, please?

00:28:38,623 --> 00:28:41,660
E-I-E-I-O?

00:28:41,727 --> 00:28:43,395
This is a private party.

00:28:43,462 --> 00:28:44,963
Uh, we have an invitation

00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:47,265
from the Las Vegas
Police Department.

00:28:47,332 --> 00:28:49,534
Uh, okay.

00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:06,718
Whoa, Nellie!

00:29:08,587 --> 00:29:10,355
Is this a raid?

00:29:10,422 --> 00:29:12,657
It's a homicide investigation.

00:29:12,724 --> 00:29:15,594
Look, we need you to stop
skritching or yiffing

00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:18,597
or whatever, take
off your costumes,

00:29:18,663 --> 00:29:20,866
and tell us your names.

00:29:30,208 --> 00:29:31,443
Ooh!

00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:33,779
These costumes
are pretty marinated.

00:29:33,845 --> 00:29:36,915
Smokey could've used
some deodorant.

00:29:36,982 --> 00:29:38,216
Well, you know, pheromones

00:29:38,283 --> 00:29:40,285
are the basis
for mammalian reproduction.

00:29:40,352 --> 00:29:42,120
When the female is in estrus,

00:29:42,187 --> 00:29:44,856
the male picks up
on her come-get-me scent.

00:29:46,892 --> 00:29:50,462
But most mammals only
copulate seasonally.

00:29:50,529 --> 00:29:52,330
How boring.

00:29:52,397 --> 00:29:54,199
For some.

00:29:57,869 --> 00:30:00,872
No one else in that furpile
threw up, right?

00:30:01,907 --> 00:30:05,077
Uh, Rocky was a target.

00:30:12,551 --> 00:30:14,720
( <i>blows air</i> )

00:30:14,786 --> 00:30:17,055
Smell this.

00:30:23,562 --> 00:30:25,530
Civet oil and ipecac.

00:30:27,566 --> 00:30:30,502
So I guess
we're looking for a wolf...

00:30:30,569 --> 00:30:32,738
in wolf's clothing.

00:30:33,772 --> 00:30:36,575
GRISSOM:
Mr. Lee, the concentration

00:30:36,641 --> 00:30:39,678
of ipecac and civet oil
on your paws

00:30:39,745 --> 00:30:43,415
speaks to application,
rather than accidental transfer.

00:30:43,482 --> 00:30:44,850
Okay. Fine.

00:30:44,916 --> 00:30:50,522
I... I mixed up some ipecac
and some civet oil

00:30:50,589 --> 00:30:55,127
and I-I... I rubbed it
on Sexy... Sexy Kitty.

00:31:00,532 --> 00:31:02,467
Why Sexy Kitty?

00:31:02,534 --> 00:31:04,770
'Cause Rocky couldn't
get enough of her.

00:31:04,836 --> 00:31:06,238
What did Rocky do to you?

00:31:06,304 --> 00:31:08,807
He's a raccoon.

00:31:08,874 --> 00:31:10,308
They're all lowlifes.

00:31:10,375 --> 00:31:14,479
I mean, honestly,
what do they do?

00:31:14,546 --> 00:31:16,815
Screw...

00:31:16,882 --> 00:31:18,817
eat garbage...

00:31:18,884 --> 00:31:20,652
screw some more.

00:31:20,719 --> 00:31:23,255
Is this a, uh,
general observation,

00:31:23,321 --> 00:31:25,791
or possibly
a personal grievance?

00:31:27,826 --> 00:31:32,464
At last year's convention,
Rocky stole my girlfriend.

00:31:32,531 --> 00:31:33,932
And in the wild,

00:31:33,999 --> 00:31:38,170
wolves are monogamous,
but raccoons are promiscuous.

00:31:38,236 --> 00:31:40,739
That's right.

00:31:42,074 --> 00:31:43,775
And I just, I knew,

00:31:43,842 --> 00:31:47,746
I knew since Sexy Kitty
was Rocky's fave, he'd have

00:31:47,813 --> 00:31:52,350
his filthy raccoon mouth
all over her again this year.

00:31:52,417 --> 00:31:54,853
All I wanted to do
was make him sick enough

00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:58,323
so that he'd have to go home
and stop cheating on my mate.

00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:00,959
Your ex-mate?

00:32:01,026 --> 00:32:02,294
Yes.

00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:05,697
I couldn't take seeing

00:32:05,764 --> 00:32:08,366
what that wanna-be marsupial
put her through.

00:32:08,433 --> 00:32:11,436
My Linda Lamb deserved better.

00:32:11,503 --> 00:32:13,338
Mr. Lee, you're a wolf.

00:32:13,405 --> 00:32:15,774
How'd you end up with a lamb?

00:32:15,841 --> 00:32:19,478
I used to work with Linda.

00:32:19,544 --> 00:32:23,715
And one day, I found out about
what she did on the weekends.

00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:28,987
And she helped me...

00:32:29,054 --> 00:32:31,056
become who I am.

00:32:31,123 --> 00:32:34,693
I always knew
that I was a...

00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,828
something else.

00:32:36,895 --> 00:32:42,891
And... Linda made it real.

00:32:45,804 --> 00:32:48,340
She was one of a kind.

00:32:48,407 --> 00:32:52,911
Does, uh, Linda Lamb
have a human last name?

00:32:53,945 --> 00:32:56,014
Jones.

00:32:56,081 --> 00:32:57,616
Why?

00:33:06,892 --> 00:33:09,561
GRISSOM:
Linda Jones is Linda Lamb.

00:33:09,628 --> 00:33:10,962
Damn it.

00:33:11,029 --> 00:33:12,864
This was here
the whole time.

00:33:12,931 --> 00:33:14,866
Yeah, but evidence without
context is not evidence.

00:33:14,933 --> 00:33:17,135
We had no reason
to search the trunk.

00:33:17,202 --> 00:33:20,806
So she didn't just hit
Rocky, she knew him.

00:33:20,872 --> 00:33:24,209
For the philandering raccoon
that he was.

00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:32,077
GRISSOM:
Okay, assuming that
Linda and Bob were heading home

00:33:32,144 --> 00:33:35,714
after Bob got sick
at the hotel,

00:33:35,781 --> 00:33:38,817
how did he end up on
the side of the road?

00:33:38,884 --> 00:33:41,987
You ever have
a car-fight?

00:33:42,054 --> 00:33:43,522
Well, if a couple has

00:33:43,588 --> 00:33:44,890
any kind of history together,

00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:46,958
they know how to press
each other's buttons.

00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,961
And you lock 'em up
in a metal box with wheels

00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:52,664
on a bad night, they're going
to start pressing 'em.

00:33:52,731 --> 00:33:54,499
You follow?

00:33:54,566 --> 00:33:58,370
So, uh, either Bob told Linda
to stop the car and let him out,

00:33:58,437 --> 00:34:00,439
or she told him
to start walking?

00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:01,940
Yes. That one.

00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,176
I mean, it's bad enough

00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:06,278
that raccoon-boy
blows his girlfriend off

00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:07,446
to go fur-piling--

00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:09,448
he gets sick licking
some nasty kitty

00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:11,349
and makes Lambchop
drive him home.

00:34:13,652 --> 00:34:15,387
Which begs
the question:

00:34:15,454 --> 00:34:18,924
why did she turn the car around
and head back toward the hotel?

00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:21,326
Well, she wasn't heading back
to the hotel.

00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:22,928
She was heading back
for him.

00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:25,364
'Cause that's how
car-fights always end.

00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:28,533
After about a mile or two,
you start to feel guilty

00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,969
that you've abandoned
the person, and you turn around.

00:34:31,036 --> 00:34:32,904
Except she didn't plan
on an 18-wheeler

00:34:32,971 --> 00:34:33,905
finishing her off.

00:34:33,972 --> 00:34:36,141
Mack truck ex machina.

00:34:37,709 --> 00:34:39,611
But it still
doesn't explain

00:34:39,678 --> 00:34:40,812
how Bob got shot

00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:41,813
in the back.

00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,315
No...

00:34:43,382 --> 00:34:45,083
but I think I may know
the last person

00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:47,919
who saw them alive.

00:34:47,986 --> 00:34:49,621
Why don't we ask
the valet

00:34:49,688 --> 00:34:53,592
if he remembers a couple of...
furriest conventioneers?

00:34:56,461 --> 00:34:58,196
Hey, Sara, no
luck on the car,

00:34:58,263 --> 00:35:00,365
but Hodges ran the
gunstock adhesive.

00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:02,667
It's primarily an
epoxy polyester resin

00:35:02,734 --> 00:35:05,170
with traces of styrene
and benzyl peroxide

00:35:05,237 --> 00:35:06,571
and ground terra-cotta.

00:35:06,638 --> 00:35:08,573
Is that supposed
to mean something to me?

00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,741
Terra-cotta's the giveaway.

00:35:09,808 --> 00:35:10,742
It's a granite glue.

00:35:10,809 --> 00:35:11,743
Granite glue?

00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:13,478
Yeah. It's used
for adhering joints

00:35:13,545 --> 00:35:14,679
on big pieces of stone.

00:35:14,746 --> 00:35:17,249
House paint on his car;
granite glue on his gun...

00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:18,583
Well, he used what
was available.

00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:19,584
That's what people do.

00:35:19,651 --> 00:35:20,752
Well, I understand
the house paint,

00:35:20,819 --> 00:35:21,920
but where do you get
granite glue?

00:35:21,987 --> 00:35:22,954
I already checked.

00:35:23,021 --> 00:35:24,122
There's not too many
places in Clark County

00:35:24,189 --> 00:35:25,290
that specialize

00:35:25,357 --> 00:35:26,792
in granite
installation, so...

00:35:26,858 --> 00:35:29,728
Okay, I will bet you
a double-double animal style

00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:33,398
that one of them employs a guy
with a blue 1984 Monte Carlo.

00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:34,733
That's a bet.

00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,734
Excellent.

00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:36,802
( <i>laughs</i> )

00:35:40,172 --> 00:35:42,908
Damn straight
I remember them.

00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:45,377
How often do you see
a six-foot raccoon heaving

00:35:45,444 --> 00:35:47,412
out a car window?

00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:48,413
Dude was hammered, man.

00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,683
His girl... she was pissed.

00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:52,818
Thank you.

00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:53,819
You've been
very helpful.

00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:54,953
All right, no problem.

00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,788
Hey, I got that.

00:35:56,855 --> 00:35:58,523
So, there's
your car-fight.

00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:00,926
Now she thinks
that he's back on the booze,

00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,327
which he denies,

00:36:02,394 --> 00:36:05,430
but the sicker he gets,
the more she thinks he's lying.

00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:08,133
I can't believe
you're drinking again.

00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,134
You promised.

00:36:09,201 --> 00:36:10,702
I was <i>not</i> drinking.

00:36:10,769 --> 00:36:13,171
( <i>grunting</i> )

00:36:13,238 --> 00:36:14,473
Must be food poisoning.

00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:16,308
( <i>chuckling</i> ):
Oh?

00:36:16,375 --> 00:36:18,043
Didn't know they served
food in a furpile.

00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:21,213
The Righteously Angry
versus the Wrongly Accused.

00:36:21,279 --> 00:36:23,115
And the battle's just beginning.

00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,483
( <i>gagging</i> )

00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:26,485
Would you just take off
the mask and talk to me?!

00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:28,320
No, just pull over
and let me out of the car!

00:36:28,387 --> 00:36:29,554
You want out?
Ah...

00:36:29,621 --> 00:36:30,555
( <i>brakes squeal</i> )

00:36:30,622 --> 00:36:31,656
Get out!
Just get out!

00:36:31,723 --> 00:36:32,891
( <i>gagging</i> )

00:36:32,958 --> 00:36:36,561
Okay, so it makes sense
up to that point, but then what?

00:36:36,628 --> 00:36:38,430
He gets out and...

00:36:39,898 --> 00:36:41,533
...she shoots him?

00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,268
I'm not so sure that people

00:36:43,335 --> 00:36:46,705
who dress up like cuddly
forest creatures carry guns.

00:36:46,772 --> 00:36:48,807
You don't think they allow
plushies in the NRA?

00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:52,044
All right, then who shot him?

00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:53,712
Well, we have
a grassy knoll...

00:36:53,779 --> 00:36:56,948
but no Lee Harvey Oswald.

00:36:57,015 --> 00:36:58,817
You're a triple threat--

00:36:58,884 --> 00:37:00,752
robbery,

00:37:00,819 --> 00:37:02,754
kidnapping, murder.

00:37:02,821 --> 00:37:04,389
Big &amp; Best Foods,

00:37:04,456 --> 00:37:07,626
Al Sesto, George Bartell.

00:37:07,692 --> 00:37:09,061
Any of this resonate?

00:37:09,127 --> 00:37:11,463
I don't know no Al Sesto.

00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:13,498
( <i>Stokes clears throat</i> )

00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:15,500
SIDLE:
Virgil, is that your shotgun?

00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:16,735
We found it in your garage.

00:37:16,802 --> 00:37:18,904
If, uh, you look,

00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:20,739
you'll see a chip in the stock.

00:37:20,806 --> 00:37:23,475
We found that in the freezer
at the Big &amp; Best Foods.

00:37:23,542 --> 00:37:25,243
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:27,245
Is this your car?

00:37:27,312 --> 00:37:29,114
It was also
in your garage.

00:37:29,181 --> 00:37:30,749
It has dual-layered paint,

00:37:30,816 --> 00:37:33,285
identical to the dual-layered
paint chips

00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:34,986
we found
on your kidnap victim.

00:37:35,053 --> 00:37:37,022
Anything to say, tough guy?

00:37:37,089 --> 00:37:38,490
Yeah.

00:37:38,557 --> 00:37:40,625
I want a lawyer.

00:38:01,847 --> 00:38:04,683
( <i>beeping faintly</i> )

00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:13,525
Hey, Grissom.

00:38:13,592 --> 00:38:16,928
Over here.
I found the bullet.

00:38:24,036 --> 00:38:26,238
GRISSOM:
Well done.

00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,140
So, we got a sick raccoon

00:38:28,206 --> 00:38:30,876
with an abdominal
through-and-through

00:38:30,942 --> 00:38:35,647
who was shot from what appears
to be a fairly steep trajectory.

00:38:35,714 --> 00:38:37,916
WILLOWS:
So, either he was shot

00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:43,021
by a giant...
or he was, uh, on all fours.

00:38:44,089 --> 00:38:45,824
( <i>gunshot, ping</i> )

00:38:45,891 --> 00:38:48,460
Or both.

00:38:48,527 --> 00:38:50,862
I mean, imagine
what it must have

00:38:50,929 --> 00:38:56,168
looked like out here at night
and from a distance.

00:38:59,137 --> 00:39:01,907
We've been looking for...

00:39:01,973 --> 00:39:04,076
a person who
shot a person,

00:39:04,142 --> 00:39:05,177
but...

00:39:07,713 --> 00:39:10,549
...maybe we should be looking
for a person who shot an animal.

00:39:18,924 --> 00:39:20,092
Hey, Virgil.

00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,662
What are you doing here?

00:39:23,729 --> 00:39:24,930
What am <i>I</i> doing here?

00:39:24,996 --> 00:39:26,765
Yeah.
Why, you guys
know each other?

00:39:26,832 --> 00:39:28,166
Yeah, that's my cousin.

00:39:28,233 --> 00:39:29,901
Pahrump?

00:39:31,002 --> 00:39:33,372
My own blood, and you set me up.

00:39:33,438 --> 00:39:35,173
After I saved
your ass.

00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,242
I should have shot you
in that freezer.

00:39:37,309 --> 00:39:38,110
You son of a bitch!

00:39:38,176 --> 00:39:39,111
VEGA:
Hey, hey!

00:39:39,177 --> 00:39:40,245
You looking
for more time?

00:39:40,312 --> 00:39:41,780
Now come on.

00:39:43,682 --> 00:39:45,450
GEORGE:
Oh, man.

00:39:48,019 --> 00:39:49,388
I'm so stupid.

00:39:49,454 --> 00:39:50,889
Ah, you're not stupid.

00:39:50,956 --> 00:39:53,091
Man, your cousin
just set you up.

00:39:53,158 --> 00:39:54,693
Bowling night.

00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,795
Is that where you told him
about the vending machines?

00:39:56,862 --> 00:39:58,463
And

00:40:02,667 --> 00:40:06,371
Well... George,
sometimes people, they, uh,

00:40:06,438 --> 00:40:08,407
disappoint

00:40:08,473 --> 00:40:09,741
us.

00:40:09,808 --> 00:40:11,276
Why?

00:40:15,213 --> 00:40:17,215
( <i>barking</i> )

00:40:24,122 --> 00:40:25,257
How you doing?

00:40:25,323 --> 00:40:26,691
Can I help you?

00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:28,527
We're with the
Las Vegas Crime Lab.

00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:30,195
This your place?
Yeah.

00:40:30,262 --> 00:40:31,697
Must be here
about that accident.

00:40:31,763 --> 00:40:32,698
Terrible thing.

00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:33,865
Like I said

00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:35,567
to the wife,
the way these 18-wheelers

00:40:35,634 --> 00:40:37,836
fly down here ballin' the jack,
I ain't surprised.

00:40:37,903 --> 00:40:39,771
I'm surprised
there ain't <i>more</i> accidents.

00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:43,508
Why don't you give us
a brief history of your evening?

00:40:43,575 --> 00:40:46,378
Ah, well, I had dinner
with the missus.

00:40:46,445 --> 00:40:48,714
Uh, fed the scraps to the dogs.

00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,949
Uh, watched <i>Jeopardy.</i>

00:40:51,016 --> 00:40:52,584
Could hardly hear it,

00:40:52,651 --> 00:40:55,120
the dogs were, uh,
so stirred up.

00:40:55,187 --> 00:40:58,256
Went outside to take a look,
spotted a coyote.

00:40:58,323 --> 00:40:59,725
This is my business.

00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:01,827
Purebreds.
Wouldn't want to lose one.

00:41:01,893 --> 00:41:04,262
So, I, uh,
took care of it.

00:41:04,329 --> 00:41:07,666
Came back inside in time
for <i>Final Jeopardy.</i>

00:41:10,602 --> 00:41:13,638
So the raccoon was mistaken
for a coyote.

00:41:13,705 --> 00:41:15,507
You gotta be kidding me.

00:41:15,574 --> 00:41:20,011
He was dosed intentionally,
but killed accidentally.

00:41:20,078 --> 00:41:21,279
We got the ranger's rifle,

00:41:21,346 --> 00:41:23,048
we collected a bullet
at the scene,

00:41:23,115 --> 00:41:24,649
and ballistics
made a match.

00:41:24,716 --> 00:41:26,618
Bob Pitt was sick
when he got out

00:41:26,685 --> 00:41:27,786
of the car,

00:41:27,853 --> 00:41:29,821
wounded when he
got onto the road,

00:41:29,888 --> 00:41:31,656
and dead when
he hit the dirt.

00:41:31,723 --> 00:41:34,359
Get out!
Just get out!

Well, the rancher's going
to get off,

Linda's dead, and Wolfie...

00:42:03,388 --> 00:42:05,290
skates with a misdemeanor.

00:42:05,357 --> 00:42:07,459

and thought "foul play,"

00:42:08,994 --> 00:42:12,097
but this was really just
a domestic dispute gone mad.

00:42:12,164 --> 00:42:15,500
Hmm. Fur and loathing
in Las Vegas.
