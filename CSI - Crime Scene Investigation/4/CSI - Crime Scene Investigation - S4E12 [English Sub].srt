Both.

00:03:22,896 --> 00:03:23,931
Uh, take the Honda.

00:03:23,997 --> 00:03:27,067
The VW belongs to the victim's
friend, over there.

00:03:27,134 --> 00:03:28,702
She called it in.

00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:30,103
BROWN:
Aw, that's too bad.

00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:32,239
This will be a day
she'll never forget.

00:03:32,306 --> 00:03:33,674
Sara, you take the perimeter.

00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,675
What?

00:03:34,741 --> 00:03:36,276
You just did
a one-hour walk-through.

00:03:36,343 --> 00:03:37,844
The perimeter cannot be
a priority.

00:03:37,911 --> 00:03:39,146
I need you to work the outside.

00:03:39,212 --> 00:03:40,414
Catherine and I will be inside.

00:03:43,483 --> 00:03:44,584
I'll go talk
to the friend.

00:03:44,651 --> 00:03:45,852
Find out where she walked

00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:47,321
and what she might
have touched in there.

00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:53,193
Hey, Jim.

00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,628
Hmm?

00:03:54,695 --> 00:03:57,531
Did you talk to that guy
across the street?

00:03:57,598 --> 00:03:59,199
The neighbor?
He's on my list.

00:03:59,266 --> 00:04:01,535
Yeah, he looks like he
has something to say.

00:04:05,339 --> 00:04:07,307
Hi, I'm Catherine Willows.
I'm with the crime lab.

00:04:07,374 --> 00:04:08,575
What is your name, miss?

00:04:08,642 --> 00:04:11,345
Kelly McNeil.

00:04:11,411 --> 00:04:13,146
Deb and I
are best friends.

00:04:13,213 --> 00:04:16,550
We were supposed
to get together yesterday.

00:04:16,617 --> 00:04:18,151
It was our day off.

00:04:18,218 --> 00:04:19,553
You're a nurse?

00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,321
Yeah. Both of us.

00:04:21,388 --> 00:04:23,490
Desert Palm Hospital.

00:04:23,557 --> 00:04:25,125
We made lunch plans,

00:04:25,192 --> 00:04:27,261
but she canceled.

00:04:27,327 --> 00:04:29,196
She give a reason why?

00:04:29,263 --> 00:04:30,230
Michael.
!
Michael?

00:04:30,297 --> 00:04:31,632
Michael Clark.

00:04:31,698 --> 00:04:34,167
Um, she's been seeing him
for a month or so.

00:04:34,234 --> 00:04:35,769
He's a surgical intern.

00:04:35,836 --> 00:04:37,804
When she didn't show up
for work today,

00:04:37,871 --> 00:04:39,339
I called the house.

00:04:39,406 --> 00:04:43,277
Her cell... no answer,
so I drove by after shift.

00:04:43,343 --> 00:04:45,612
And how did you get in?

00:04:45,679 --> 00:04:48,315
We have each other's keys.

00:04:48,382 --> 00:04:50,917
Did you touch anything inside?

00:04:50,984 --> 00:04:52,219
No.

00:04:52,286 --> 00:04:55,522
I walked in and...

00:04:55,589 --> 00:04:57,891
I saw her and I ran out.

00:05:04,631 --> 00:05:07,234
Kelly, this, uh, Michael--

00:05:07,301 --> 00:05:11,171
is he just a guy, or is he
somebody special?

00:05:11,238 --> 00:05:15,042
He was the first guy that Debbie
ever blew me off for.

00:05:15,108 --> 00:05:17,210
And did you see him today,
at the hospital?

00:05:17,277 --> 00:05:22,115
No. I figured they were both
playing hooky.

00:05:44,471 --> 00:05:46,340
MAN:
<i>Moved in about two months ago.</i>

00:05:46,406 --> 00:05:47,441
Single girl.
Alone in the house.

00:05:47,507 --> 00:05:48,475
Got my attention.

00:05:48,542 --> 00:05:50,310
I'm running for captain
of the Neighborhood Watch.

00:05:50,377 --> 00:05:51,712
I'll probably have
to self-appoint myself,

00:05:51,778 --> 00:05:52,846
but I'm going
to put out a flyer,

00:05:52,913 --> 00:05:55,315
you know, about shutting doors,
locking windows,

00:05:55,382 --> 00:05:56,583
I mean, the thing is...

00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:58,352
you just don't think
it's going to happen to you.

00:05:58,418 --> 00:05:59,519
You know what I'm saying?

00:05:59,586 --> 00:06:01,421
On your block...
Listen, Pike.
Stop talking.

00:06:01,488 --> 00:06:03,323
I never seen somebody
so excited

00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:05,259
about their neighbor
being killed.

00:06:05,325 --> 00:06:07,661
Let me tell you something:
I know the business of everyone

00:06:07,728 --> 00:06:09,062
up and down this block,
all right?

00:06:09,129 --> 00:06:10,931
Who's cheating on his wife,
who's behind on his bills,

00:06:10,998 --> 00:06:12,499
whose kid's going
to become the next Manson.

00:06:12,566 --> 00:06:14,701
Let's talk about Debbie Marlin.

00:06:14,768 --> 00:06:16,303
You know what they say
about nurses.

00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:17,838
What's that?

00:06:17,904 --> 00:06:18,905
That-that they like to party.

00:06:20,107 --> 00:06:22,676
Hey, look. You see
a stethoscope around this chest?

00:06:22,743 --> 00:06:24,778
No. You want to know why?
I'm not a doctor.

00:06:24,845 --> 00:06:26,546
So I couldn't even
get close to her.

00:06:26,613 --> 00:06:28,215
Well, who is getting close?

00:06:28,282 --> 00:06:30,617
It's like a fricking
doctor auto mall over there.

00:06:30,684 --> 00:06:31,918
You know, hunky surgeons,

00:06:31,985 --> 00:06:33,253
board certified,
lots of dough.

00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,454
And if you want my opinion,

00:06:34,521 --> 00:06:35,956
I think they were
dropping quarts.

00:06:36,023 --> 00:06:39,259
Okay, did you notice
any automobiles,

00:06:39,326 --> 00:06:41,028
any cars out front?

00:06:41,094 --> 00:06:43,897
You know, as a matter
of fact, sir, yes.

00:06:43,964 --> 00:06:45,732
Black Mercedes, E320.

00:06:45,799 --> 00:06:48,368
2004 model,
been there about a month.

00:06:48,435 --> 00:06:49,736
Rolls in all hours.

00:06:49,803 --> 00:06:52,105
I'm figuring on call,
booty call.

00:06:52,172 --> 00:06:53,340
That kind of thing.

00:06:53,407 --> 00:06:54,775
When's the last time
you saw the Mercedes?

00:06:54,841 --> 00:06:56,076
Two days ago. Around lunch.

00:06:56,143 --> 00:06:58,912
And, uh, I think he stayed
for a little bit of dinner, too.

00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:00,380
Thanks a lot.

00:07:00,447 --> 00:07:02,416
Yeah, this is
Detective Jim Brass.

00:07:02,482 --> 00:07:06,086
See if you can find a 2004
Mercedes, black,

00:07:06,153 --> 00:07:08,322
registered
to a Michael Clark, M.D.

00:07:08,388 --> 00:07:10,657
Thanks.

00:07:10,724 --> 00:07:13,860
I have absolutely nothing.
How are you doing?

00:07:13,927 --> 00:07:14,962
I got a lot.

00:07:15,028 --> 00:07:16,563
Check out the backseat.

00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:18,498
Bananas.

00:07:18,565 --> 00:07:20,233
Stuffed Mushrooms.

00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,603
Chocolate syrup,
a six-pack of soda,

00:07:22,669 --> 00:07:23,770
a box of condoms.

00:07:23,837 --> 00:07:25,405
No surprises there.

00:07:25,472 --> 00:07:27,140
Fresh bag of groceries
in an unlocked car?

00:07:27,207 --> 00:07:31,078
Maybe she was interrupted.

00:07:44,691 --> 00:07:45,959
One thing I can never

00:07:46,026 --> 00:07:48,161
get over
with this job:

00:07:48,228 --> 00:07:51,164
anything can happen to anybody.

00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,035
That's why we're here.

00:08:04,778 --> 00:08:09,950
I bet this bathroom was the
reason she bought this place.

00:08:14,855 --> 00:08:15,956
What am I smelling?

00:08:16,023 --> 00:08:18,692
Cleanser.

00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:20,227
Bleach maybe.

00:08:23,697 --> 00:08:26,633
Arterial spray is neck high.

00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:30,170
Indicates she was standing
when she was attacked.

00:08:32,706 --> 00:08:36,143
And the highest gush of blood
has the most volume.

00:08:36,209 --> 00:08:38,345
Definite lack of lividity.
She must have bled out.

00:08:38,412 --> 00:08:41,715
The killer had
to get something on him.

00:08:41,782 --> 00:08:43,951
Had to be a bloody mess,
but there's no...

00:08:45,619 --> 00:08:47,521
footprints,
there's no handprints,

00:08:47,587 --> 00:08:49,256
no smears.

00:08:49,323 --> 00:08:50,891
She looks like

00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:54,361
she was placed
in this position.

00:08:55,896 --> 00:08:56,964
What's the message?

00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,538
What do we got here?

00:09:04,605 --> 00:09:06,273
Pendale's Milk.

00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:10,277
Non-fat. Half a gallon.
Unopened.

00:09:10,344 --> 00:09:13,880
Groceries that
made it inside.

00:09:13,947 --> 00:09:17,250
Fancy crackers...

00:09:17,317 --> 00:09:18,619
brie.

00:09:21,321 --> 00:09:23,857
Coupons with no receipt.

00:09:23,924 --> 00:09:26,793
No receipt?

00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,028
This milk expires on the 23rd.

00:09:28,095 --> 00:09:31,331
Eight days from now.

00:09:31,398 --> 00:09:33,267
Milk is delivered daily
to the supermarket.

00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:34,468
That's a ten-day window.

00:09:34,534 --> 00:09:36,603
People usually reach back
for a fresh one.

00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:38,939
Hmm...

00:09:39,006 --> 00:09:40,907
Subtract ten from the 23rd?

00:09:40,974 --> 00:09:43,377
She was at Pendale's
two days ago.

00:09:43,443 --> 00:09:45,479
Well, according to Brass,
that was the last time

00:09:45,545 --> 00:09:47,281
her boyfriend's car
was seen out front.

00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,921
Positive for both.

00:10:27,988 --> 00:10:30,123
Same here.

00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:32,492
So there's blood
in all four drains,

00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:33,927
followed by bleach.

00:10:33,994 --> 00:10:36,330
He kills Debbie in the shower.

00:10:36,396 --> 00:10:39,132
Then he washes up
in both sinks

00:10:39,199 --> 00:10:40,801
and in the tub?

00:10:40,867 --> 00:10:42,469
Why?

00:10:42,536 --> 00:10:46,540
The answer is in the drains.

He cleaned everywhere
but inside the shower.

00:11:55,676 --> 00:11:57,077
WILLOWS:
We're never going to know

00:11:57,144 --> 00:12:01,081
where the blood ends
and the bleach begins.

00:12:01,148 --> 00:12:03,717
Where's all this blood
coming from?

00:12:07,421 --> 00:12:09,723
Dr. Clark is
on my surgical rotation.

00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:12,292
He was scheduled
to assist this morning.

00:12:12,359 --> 00:12:13,460
No show.

00:12:13,527 --> 00:12:14,628
Oh.

00:12:14,695 --> 00:12:16,863
Was that like him?

00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:18,198
No. It's completely
out of character.

00:12:18,265 --> 00:12:20,033
See, half of these interns
come in here so scared,

00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,035
they couldn't carve a turkey.

00:12:22,102 --> 00:12:25,505
I have to give them scalpels
with training wheels.

00:12:25,572 --> 00:12:26,540
Clark was different.

00:12:26,607 --> 00:12:27,541
He, uh,

00:12:27,608 --> 00:12:30,377
he's a real artist,
a steady hand.

00:12:30,444 --> 00:12:32,045
Yeah, he has a gift.

00:12:32,112 --> 00:12:35,015
How about outside the O.R.?

00:12:35,082 --> 00:12:36,316
Was he socially gifted?

00:12:36,383 --> 00:12:38,885
He turned a lot
of nurses' heads,

00:12:38,952 --> 00:12:41,388
but it never interfered
with his work.

00:12:41,455 --> 00:12:42,389
Why the questions?

00:12:42,456 --> 00:12:43,390
Debbie Marlin,

00:12:43,457 --> 00:12:44,524
one of your nurses,
was murdered.

00:12:44,591 --> 00:12:45,525
Throat slashed.

00:12:45,592 --> 00:12:47,561
You didn't know this?

00:12:47,628 --> 00:12:48,929
Dr. Clark and
his "steady hand"

00:12:48,996 --> 00:12:50,664
haven't been seen
or heard from since,

00:12:50,731 --> 00:12:52,065
so you don't have to
be a brain surgeon

00:12:52,132 --> 00:12:53,433
to guess what I'm thinking.

00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:57,404
( <i>pager beeping</i> )
Uh... all I can ask
is that I...

00:26:31,751 --> 00:26:33,353
I've been sifting
through this trash

00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:34,521
for about six hours.

00:26:34,587 --> 00:26:37,123
You coming to rescue me
or make fun of me?

00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:39,592
I am just looking. Relax.

00:26:39,659 --> 00:26:41,294
What are these
white fibers here?

00:26:41,361 --> 00:26:43,696
They must be
from the spare bedroom

00:26:43,763 --> 00:26:45,899
because all the other carpets
are green.

00:26:45,965 --> 00:26:49,869
Spare bedroom wasn't on
his entrance or exit path.

00:26:49,936 --> 00:26:52,238
Look, all I know is that they
were near the top of the bag,

00:26:52,305 --> 00:26:54,574
so it must have been one of
the last things he vacuumed.

00:26:56,509 --> 00:27:00,013
I did happen to find
this butterfly pendant,

00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:01,915
with some white fibers
on it.

00:27:01,981 --> 00:27:04,384
It looks like it's from
a necklace or a bracelet

00:27:04,451 --> 00:27:06,052
and it has this link
that snaps,

00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:09,923
so I'm thinking...
sign of struggle?

00:27:09,989 --> 00:27:12,559
The killer was in
that spare bedroom.

00:27:20,166 --> 00:27:22,702
Feel better?

00:27:24,737 --> 00:27:27,107
Well, now that we fed you,

00:27:27,173 --> 00:27:29,576
we should probably
talk about a shower.

As soon as we find
some evidence, I promise.

With fresh eyes,
you won't miss it.

00:27:42,188 --> 00:27:44,290
Just talk it through with me,
will you?

00:27:44,357 --> 00:27:45,925

sexed up.

00:28:10,316 --> 00:28:12,986

so I'm safe...
Greg, please,
I'm very tired.

00:36:12,314 --> 00:36:15,284
Well, maybe the guy we're
looking for is going bald...

00:36:15,351 --> 00:36:16,652
or trying not to.

00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:18,487
According
to Papa Olaf,

00:36:18,554 --> 00:36:21,157
a lot of guys who
use Rogaine also
use Propecia,

00:36:21,223 --> 00:36:22,491

a cocktail.

00:36:22,558 --> 00:36:23,993
I ran the hair through MassSpec.

00:36:24,059 --> 00:36:26,162
I got four peaks: ethyl alcohol,

00:36:26,228 --> 00:36:30,032
propylene glycol, minoxidil,
and finasteride.

00:36:30,099 --> 00:36:32,168
Finasteride,

00:36:32,234 --> 00:36:34,270
the chemical name for Propecia.

00:36:34,336 --> 00:36:37,006
But wait, there's more,
and it's a family secret.

00:36:37,072 --> 00:36:40,009
Sexual. Happens in less
than two percent of users.

00:36:40,075 --> 00:36:43,746

Papa Olaf was one of those guys
that needed hydraulics.

00:36:51,921 --> 00:36:53,122
Oh.

The old sex alibi.

00:37:03,065 --> 00:37:06,202
Too bad he didn't leave

00:37:06,268 --> 00:37:07,403
You got a take on him?

00:37:07,469 --> 00:37:11,073
Balloon head, but credible...

00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,174

00:37:12,241 --> 00:37:13,642

00:37:15,211 --> 00:37:17,646
No.

00:37:17,713 --> 00:37:19,215
Anything else?

00:37:19,281 --> 00:37:21,283
He's a lefty.

00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:23,652
Okay, keep in mind,
this is just a theory.

00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:27,223
It's a hot button issue
among forensic pathologists.

00:37:27,289 --> 00:37:29,258
What's the consensus?
Most doctors say

00:37:29,325 --> 00:37:30,759
it's impossible
to prove handedness

00:37:30,826 --> 00:37:34,230
based on the wounds inflicted
on a victim.

00:37:34,296 --> 00:37:36,899
Forget hard science.
What's your hypothesis?

00:37:36,966 --> 00:37:38,934
Based on micro-incisions

00:37:39,001 --> 00:37:40,236
and hesitation marks,

00:37:40,302 --> 00:37:42,705
the victim was lying face up
when he was killed.

00:37:42,771 --> 00:37:46,075
Take a look
at the right knee.

00:37:46,142 --> 00:37:48,911
The cut on the cartilage
of the right distal femur

00:37:48,978 --> 00:37:50,746
has slight angulations

00:37:50,813 --> 00:37:53,048
from the, uh...

00:37:53,115 --> 00:37:55,317
left distal
to the right proximal,

00:37:55,384 --> 00:37:57,653
which suggests the killer
was left-handed.

00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,188
This angulation
is consistent

00:37:59,255 --> 00:38:01,857
with cuts made to the acetabulum
and to the wrist,

00:38:01,924 --> 00:38:05,728
but bear in mind, it's not going
to be admissible in court.

00:38:05,794 --> 00:38:08,330
I don't care about court.

00:38:08,397 --> 00:38:11,500
My mind's on a left-handed,
Propecia-using surgeon

00:38:11,567 --> 00:38:14,470
who's probably on staff
at Desert Palm.

00:38:46,802 --> 00:38:48,471
There was no need
for the light show.

00:38:48,537 --> 00:38:50,506
All you had to do was ask.

00:38:50,573 --> 00:38:52,141
Good.

00:38:52,208 --> 00:38:54,310
Since we're being
completely honest...

00:38:54,376 --> 00:38:56,445
are you losing
your hair?

00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:59,181
I'm a 48-year-old man.
I'm not unique.

00:39:00,216 --> 00:39:01,550
Your hair is, though.

00:39:02,818 --> 00:39:05,154
We found it at the crime scene.

00:39:05,221 --> 00:39:08,624
Minoxidil absorbs
infrared light.

00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:13,329
I-I take Rogaine
and Propecia.

00:39:13,395 --> 00:39:15,798
Again, not unique.
Well, we think

00:39:15,865 --> 00:39:17,333
that Debbie Marlin
and Michael Clark

00:39:17,399 --> 00:39:19,835
were killed by a surgeon
who is left-handed,

00:39:19,902 --> 00:39:23,172
and we know of two
left-handed surgeons
at Desert Palm:

00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:26,709
Dr. Tripton, who has
an alibi, and you.

00:39:26,775 --> 00:39:28,677
Well, if you're going
to make accusations,

00:39:28,744 --> 00:39:31,147
you should really do
your homework.

00:39:31,213 --> 00:39:34,316
Howard and I are
the only lefties on staff.

00:39:34,383 --> 00:39:36,852
Dr. Randolph, who has privileges
at the hospital,

00:39:36,919 --> 00:39:37,853
he's also a lefty.

00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,355
We play tennis every Wednesday.

00:39:39,421 --> 00:39:41,056
He's got a heck of a back-hand.

00:39:42,258 --> 00:39:44,059
If you want me
to name more names,

00:39:44,126 --> 00:39:47,163
I could, but you don't want me
to do your job

00:39:47,229 --> 00:39:48,864
for you, do you?

00:39:48,931 --> 00:39:49,899
Gentlemen...

00:39:49,965 --> 00:39:52,268
we're here as
a courtesy,

00:39:52,334 --> 00:39:53,869
so if you're quite through
wasting our time,

00:39:53,936 --> 00:39:55,204
I think that the doctor
would like

00:39:55,271 --> 00:39:57,506
to get back to the
business of saving lives.

00:39:57,573 --> 00:39:58,707
Not so fast.

00:39:58,774 --> 00:40:00,276
Is this a link

00:40:00,342 --> 00:40:02,878
from a bracelet
you gave Debbie?

00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,382
Mm-hmm. It looks like it.

00:40:06,448 --> 00:40:08,184
Where's the rest of it?

00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:09,752
This link was vacuumed
from the floor

00:40:09,819 --> 00:40:11,387
of the spare bedroom
after the murder.

00:40:11,453 --> 00:40:12,855
The other link was
in her jewelry box.

00:40:12,922 --> 00:40:15,424
The funny thing is
that all the bracelets

00:40:15,491 --> 00:40:19,862
from the other guys she
slept with are intact.

00:40:19,929 --> 00:40:23,732
Well, all I can tell you
is when I gave it to her,

00:40:23,799 --> 00:40:25,734
it was in one piece.

00:40:33,843 --> 00:40:35,411
Do you have any other evidence?

00:40:36,979 --> 00:40:39,048
No, we don't.

00:40:39,114 --> 00:40:42,117
We might not have any other
evidence, but we have a theory.

00:40:42,184 --> 00:40:44,420
That's not admissible in court.

00:40:44,487 --> 00:40:46,789
Oh, no, no, it's worth a listen.

00:40:51,327 --> 00:40:55,030
We think you killed
Debbie Marlin because
she rejected you,

00:40:55,097 --> 00:40:57,700
and Michael Clark
paid the price.

00:41:02,505 --> 00:41:04,740
Thank you for your time
and your theories,

00:41:04,807 --> 00:41:09,311
but you said it yourself:
you don't have a case.

00:41:09,378 --> 00:41:11,380
Doctor.

00:41:16,986 --> 00:41:18,120
It's sad, isn't it, Doc?

00:41:19,155 --> 00:41:21,790
Guys like us.

00:41:23,459 --> 00:41:25,227
Couple of middle-aged men

00:41:25,294 --> 00:41:27,530
who've allowed their work
to consume their lives.

00:41:29,632 --> 00:41:31,167
The only time

00:41:31,233 --> 00:41:33,235
we ever touch other people
is when we're wearing

00:41:33,302 --> 00:41:34,703
our latex gloves.

00:41:36,939 --> 00:41:39,241
We wake up one day and realize
that for 50 years

00:41:39,308 --> 00:41:41,310
we haven't really lived at all.

00:41:43,813 --> 00:41:47,249
But then, all of a sudden...

00:41:47,316 --> 00:41:49,418
we get a second chance.

00:41:52,621 --> 00:41:54,023
<i>Somebody young and beautiful</i>
<i>shows up.</i>

00:41:54,089 --> 00:41:55,291
<i>Somebody...</i>

00:41:55,357 --> 00:41:58,861
we could care about.

00:41:58,928 --> 00:42:01,730
She offers us a new life
with her...

00:42:03,265 --> 00:42:06,869
...but we have
a big decision
to make, right?

00:42:06,936 --> 00:42:09,538
Because we have to risk
everything we've worked for

00:42:09,605 --> 00:42:11,941
in order to have her.

00:42:15,277 --> 00:42:19,048
I couldn't do it...

00:42:19,114 --> 00:42:21,283
but you did.

00:42:23,452 --> 00:42:26,222
You risked it all...

00:42:26,288 --> 00:42:30,125
and she showed you
a wonderful life,
didn't she?

00:42:34,964 --> 00:42:38,200
But then she took it away
and gave it to somebody else,

00:42:38,267 --> 00:42:40,035
<i>and you were lost.</i>

00:42:43,906 --> 00:42:45,708
So you took her life.

00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:54,717
Debbie, it's me,
Michael.

00:42:58,287 --> 00:43:00,689
GRISSOM:
<i>You killed them both,</i>

00:43:00,756 --> 00:43:03,592
and now you have nothing.

00:43:05,761 --> 00:43:07,830
I'm still here.

00:43:08,864 --> 00:43:10,109
Are you?
