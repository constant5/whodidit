I would, um...
I would pull my leotards

really high up on my hips,
and stick feathers in my hair,

00:00:36,521 --> 00:00:41,092
put on my mom's high heels, and
then I would put on this show.

FEMALE REPORTER:
This is day six in the search
for Julie Waters,

00:00:46,364 --> 00:00:48,633
the model and aspiring showgirl

00:00:48,699 --> 00:00:51,302
reported missing by her parents
last Thursday.

00:00:51,369 --> 00:00:53,204
Authorities are asking
for the public's help

00:00:53,271 --> 00:00:55,339
in any information regarding

00:00:55,406 --> 00:00:56,641
her whereabouts.

00:00:56,707 --> 00:00:58,142
Where is Julie Waters?

00:00:58,209 --> 00:01:00,211
That's the question authorities
are asking...

00:01:01,913 --> 00:01:03,247
What is your emergency?

00:01:03,314 --> 00:01:05,316
She's so beautiful.

00:01:05,383 --> 00:01:09,420
Soft and... sweet...

00:01:09,487 --> 00:01:12,156
like an angel.

00:01:12,223 --> 00:01:13,524
What is your emergency?

00:01:13,591 --> 00:01:15,426
I never meant to hurt her.

00:01:15,493 --> 00:01:16,561
Sir?

00:01:16,627 --> 00:01:21,599
I couldn't get the smile
off of my face.

00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:22,967
I didn't even

00:01:23,034 --> 00:01:25,269
see when the security guard
came up to me,

00:01:25,336 --> 00:01:26,771
and he told me
that I had to leave.

00:01:26,838 --> 00:01:29,373
You know, "All rehearsals
are closed."

00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,077
So I got up,

00:01:33,144 --> 00:01:35,680
and then he turns to me...

00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:51,963
SWAT OFFICER:
He's coming out.

00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:55,132
Be advised: suspect is armed.

He's coming out.

00:02:41,045 --> 00:02:42,813
See this face?

00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,982

Jim, the world's watching.

00:02:48,052 --> 00:02:50,021
I want him waiting for me.

00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:58,496
SWAT cleared the
house. It's empty.

00:02:58,563 --> 00:03:00,231
So no girl?

What did he blow?

00:03:04,368 --> 00:03:05,937
A .21.

Going to take him
a long time to sober up.

I'm not waiting.

00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,541
Did he say anything about her?

00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:12,510
He never actually
mentioned her name.

00:03:12,577 --> 00:03:14,045
All he said was,

00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:15,847
"I never meant to hurt her."

I expect an answer to that

00:04:18,321 --> 00:04:20,724
is finished processing
the house.

00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,392

Nothing like predicting
the future.

all the way up
until this morning.

I mean, I've been taking dancing
lessons since I was five.

I would, um...
I would pull my leotards...

00:05:04,935 --> 00:05:07,270
More Julie Waters.

00:05:07,337 --> 00:05:09,372
...stick feathers in my hair,

00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:11,441
put on my mom's high heels...

Her mom.

She said she talks
to her every day.

00:06:46,736 --> 00:06:49,239

couldn't reach her by nightfall.

Her bills were paid,
ready to mail.

00:06:58,081 --> 00:07:00,283
Doesn't look like any
of her toiletries were missing.

00:07:03,253 --> 00:07:04,254
She even left

00:07:04,321 --> 00:07:06,189
her birth control pills.
Strange.

00:07:06,256 --> 00:07:08,024
Her mom said she had dinner

00:07:08,091 --> 00:07:10,827

of <i>Real Vegas Showgirls.</i>

What about her car?

00:07:18,134 --> 00:07:19,903
It was found four days ago
at Dante's Pizza

00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:23,673

parking lot.
Locked.

It's the only thing
that was missing.

00:07:30,246 --> 00:07:32,248
What about the drunk guy?

00:07:32,315 --> 00:07:34,284
STOKES:
A professional
photographer.

00:07:34,351 --> 00:07:35,752
Lives alone.

You collected
everything

00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:38,355
at his house--
no evidence of Julie?

00:07:38,421 --> 00:07:40,890
Although the place was papered
with articles about her,

00:07:40,957 --> 00:07:43,994
all acquired after the fact.

We already know
who you're talking about.

00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,155

it was from mile marker 15?

Why don't you take
off your sunglasses
and your hat?

Are we in the right place?

You walk like a dancer.

Do you moonlight?

00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:29,592
I'll bet you're
featured, huh?

00:10:29,659 --> 00:10:31,594
High dollar.

00:10:31,661 --> 00:10:34,264
Nice long hair
down your back?

00:10:34,331 --> 00:10:36,099
What were you wearing
that day, Howard?

00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:38,168
I like long hair.

00:10:40,203 --> 00:10:41,972
You recognize any
of these rock formations?

00:10:42,038 --> 00:10:44,641
You could grow yours
out more, but...

00:11:18,141 --> 00:11:19,909
What are we doing?

00:11:19,976 --> 00:11:21,411
Is this logical?

00:11:21,478 --> 00:11:24,648
We have suspects picking
their criminalists now.

00:11:26,483 --> 00:11:28,752
Well, we all want
the same thing, Sara.

00:11:28,818 --> 00:11:30,587
Catherine may
have a way in.

00:11:30,654 --> 00:11:32,088
It could be helpful.

00:11:32,155 --> 00:11:35,158
So this looks
helpful to you?

00:11:51,408 --> 00:11:53,610
We're not finding anything.

00:11:53,677 --> 00:11:55,245
You said she was here.

00:11:55,312 --> 00:11:57,614
I'm getting confused...
all these people here.

00:11:57,681 --> 00:12:00,550
You'd be less confused
if it was just you and me?

00:12:00,617 --> 00:12:03,720
I see pictures of her
on TV, in the magazines,
the newspapers...

00:12:03,787 --> 00:12:05,188
Mr. Delhomme,
we're going

00:12:05,255 --> 00:12:06,523
to take you back
to the station.

00:12:06,589 --> 00:12:07,524
I'd rather go home.

00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:09,592
Not yet.

00:12:11,594 --> 00:12:13,430
Hey, uh...
Get in!

00:12:13,496 --> 00:12:14,998
we need him in one piece.

00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:27,143
All right, at least
we can hold onto him
for a while.

00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:29,813
Well, the public defender
may have him out on bail
by tomorrow morning.

00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:31,781
Meanwhile, we still
haven't found anything.

00:12:31,848 --> 00:12:33,483
Now, did anyone stop
to think this guy

00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,484
might just be nuts?

00:12:34,551 --> 00:12:35,952
Well, until
we find the body,

00:12:36,019 --> 00:12:37,721
he is all the evidence
we've got.

00:12:37,787 --> 00:12:38,989
We don't even know
if he did it.

00:12:39,055 --> 00:12:40,857
Oh, I've got a good feeling
about this.

00:12:40,924 --> 00:12:41,992
So does the suspect.

00:12:42,058 --> 00:12:43,760
The only reason that
we're out here today

00:12:43,827 --> 00:12:46,696
on this wild goose chase
is because he wanted
to hang out with you.

00:12:46,763 --> 00:12:48,632
It's weird.
Believe me,

00:12:48,698 --> 00:12:49,966
I'd rather follow
the evidence,

00:12:50,033 --> 00:12:52,202
but if it takes having
the evidence follow me...

00:12:52,269 --> 00:12:53,637
The original
missing persons call

00:12:53,703 --> 00:12:56,172
was mine and Sara's.

00:12:56,239 --> 00:12:57,907
I'm the senior CSI here.

00:12:57,974 --> 00:12:59,643
Uh, I'm the senior CSI here.

00:12:59,709 --> 00:13:00,744
You want it?

00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:02,078
Hold on, now.

00:13:02,145 --> 00:13:03,179
This is a career
case, Grissom.

00:13:03,246 --> 00:13:05,248
You know Sara and I both
put in for a promotion.

00:13:05,315 --> 00:13:07,484
If we work this, we're on
departmental radar here.

00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,718
I got the most
high-profile cases

00:13:08,785 --> 00:13:10,420
under my belt;
I think that the sheriff

00:13:10,487 --> 00:13:12,822
would rest easier
knowing that I was
heading it up.

00:13:12,889 --> 00:13:14,024
It's a big department.

00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:15,225
There's a lot
of room at the top.

00:13:15,292 --> 00:13:16,559
We wouldn't
ask for it

00:13:16,626 --> 00:13:18,795
if we couldn't do it.

00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:28,872
Fine.

00:13:40,917 --> 00:13:43,453
You going to have my back?

00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,523
I always have your back.

00:13:46,589 --> 00:13:49,893
He wanted me. He's got me.

00:13:51,461 --> 00:13:53,296
Suspected murderer
Howard Delhomme

00:13:53,363 --> 00:13:56,333
led police department personnel
on a fruitless search

00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,001
for the body of Julie Waters.

00:13:58,068 --> 00:14:01,204
The search was called off
in darkness with no indication

00:14:01,271 --> 00:14:02,939
that law enforcement personnel

00:14:03,006 --> 00:14:05,241
will continue to comb
the Red Rock area.

00:14:05,308 --> 00:14:06,943
ATWATER:
Just don't make
me look bad.

00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:08,812
Hey, you set the stage.

00:14:08,878 --> 00:14:11,381
You know voters--
they like swift
resolutions.

00:14:11,448 --> 00:14:13,350
If he's the guy,
I need to say it.

00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:15,852
Well, let's find out
if he is the guy first.

00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:17,420
Who's that with Cath?

00:14:20,624 --> 00:14:22,392
Greg Sanders. DNA.

00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:23,893
Is he on the case?

00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,928
Yeah.

00:14:24,995 --> 00:14:26,930
Hell of a time to break out

00:14:26,997 --> 00:14:28,498
the "B" team, isn't it?

00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,735
Remember, we're
looking for anything

00:14:31,801 --> 00:14:34,838
this guy did
last Thursday, November 6.

00:14:34,904 --> 00:14:37,574
Find out where he was seven days
ago, and we'll find Julie.

00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:42,412
So, I know Warrick's off.

00:14:42,479 --> 00:14:44,014
And Sara's pissed.

00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,782
Why not ask Nick to help?

00:14:45,849 --> 00:14:47,717
You want to learn.

00:14:49,419 --> 00:14:52,022
And you can start
by not repeating my mistakes.

00:14:52,088 --> 00:14:54,190
You mean Sam Braun?

00:14:54,257 --> 00:14:56,793
I screwed up.

00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:57,927
You covered me.

00:14:57,994 --> 00:14:59,029
That's why I'm here?

00:14:59,095 --> 00:15:02,465
No, you're here
because I want you to be here.

00:15:02,532 --> 00:15:04,100
Oh.

00:15:06,002 --> 00:15:07,203
He was hungry.

00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:08,371
"Big Snax."

00:15:08,438 --> 00:15:10,073
The chain.

00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:13,209
He bought soda for 75 cents,
snack for 75 cents,

00:15:13,276 --> 00:15:15,211
and a household item for $9.99.

00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:18,782
Household item?
That could be anything.

00:15:21,251 --> 00:15:25,322
Inucci Motors.
He checked out a car

00:15:25,388 --> 00:15:26,957
at 2:00 that afternoon,

00:15:27,023 --> 00:15:29,559
and returned it the following
morning at 9:00 a.m.

00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,728
Why would Howard Delhomme

00:15:31,795 --> 00:15:33,530
have a receipt
for one of your cars?

00:15:33,596 --> 00:15:35,632
We hired him
to photograph it.

00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:36,733
Did you instruct him

00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,868
to hire a model
for the photo shoot?

00:15:38,935 --> 00:15:41,004
Model? Never. Nothing
in the photograph

00:15:41,071 --> 00:15:43,006
should be sexier
than the automobile.

00:15:43,073 --> 00:15:45,475
Where is the car?

00:15:45,542 --> 00:15:47,277
It's not just a car.

00:15:47,344 --> 00:15:48,311
It's a Maserati.

00:15:48,378 --> 00:15:50,246
Well, I appreciate that.

00:15:50,313 --> 00:15:51,514
I still need to look at it.

00:15:51,581 --> 00:15:52,916
Honey...

00:15:52,983 --> 00:15:56,219
the car has been
detailed three times

00:15:56,286 --> 00:15:57,487
since Howard
brought it back.

00:15:57,554 --> 00:15:59,556
It's getting primed
for a whale tomorrow.

00:15:59,623 --> 00:16:01,424
You're wasting
your time.

00:16:01,491 --> 00:16:04,227
You know what I did the last
time I looked at a car?

00:16:04,294 --> 00:16:06,563
I cut out
a 12-by-12-inch section

00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:07,664
of leather from every seat.

00:16:07,731 --> 00:16:10,100
Guy was a drug dealer.

00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:12,435
You know, a salesman?

00:16:12,502 --> 00:16:15,071
I need this car.

00:16:15,138 --> 00:16:16,406
Untouched.

00:16:16,473 --> 00:16:18,241
Oh, well,
I can't promise you that.

00:16:18,308 --> 00:16:20,443
But what I can promise you

00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:22,946
is that, for the next few hours,

00:16:23,013 --> 00:16:25,482
that car is mine.

00:17:18,602 --> 00:17:21,805
Boy, what I could do
with a car like this.

00:17:21,871 --> 00:17:23,106
Take these

00:17:23,173 --> 00:17:24,441
and compare them
to the toothbrush

00:17:24,507 --> 00:17:27,243
that Sara collected
from Julie Waters'
apartment.

00:17:30,013 --> 00:17:31,014
Hey...

00:17:31,081 --> 00:17:33,083
you want to gawk,
do it on your own time.

00:17:33,149 --> 00:17:34,618
You want to work with me,
stay focused.

00:17:34,684 --> 00:17:36,419
Got it.

00:17:39,389 --> 00:17:41,391
I don't believe this.

00:17:43,393 --> 00:17:45,428
What does it matter?
We're all on the same team.

00:17:45,495 --> 00:17:47,130
Nick, it was our case.

00:17:47,197 --> 00:17:49,799
You said it:
you wait a career

00:17:49,866 --> 00:17:50,867
for a case like this.

00:17:50,934 --> 00:17:52,002
Put us on

00:17:52,068 --> 00:17:53,670
the front line for promotion.

00:17:53,737 --> 00:17:55,338
Let's just
find her, okay?

00:17:55,405 --> 00:17:58,174
You know what the
worst part about
this whole thing is?

00:17:58,241 --> 00:18:00,677
Catherine knows
I can do this case.

00:18:00,744 --> 00:18:01,778
So can I.

00:18:03,213 --> 00:18:04,981
I would take
you and me

00:18:05,048 --> 00:18:07,183
over Catherine and Greg
anytime.

00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,853
She's got Greg helping her?

00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,721
Yeah.

00:18:14,024 --> 00:18:15,992
Well, the only way to learn
is by getting out in the field.

00:18:16,059 --> 00:18:18,328
And, if Greg
helps find her,

00:18:18,395 --> 00:18:20,263
I'm okay with that.

00:18:21,531 --> 00:18:22,899
<i>The first day that I got here</i>

00:18:22,966 --> 00:18:25,335
I went straight
to the Tropicana.

00:18:25,402 --> 00:18:28,371
I walked right past
all of the slots and the tables

00:18:28,438 --> 00:18:30,607
to the Tiffany Theater.

00:18:30,674 --> 00:18:33,910
I snuck in,
and I just sat there

00:18:33,977 --> 00:18:38,281
in the back row, just watching.

00:18:38,348 --> 00:18:40,817
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:18:40,884 --> 00:18:44,587
I couldn't get the smile
off of my face.

00:18:44,654 --> 00:18:46,156
( <i>laughs</i> )

00:18:46,222 --> 00:18:48,425
I didn't even see
when the security guard

00:18:48,491 --> 00:18:51,828
came up to me, and he told me
that I had to leave.

00:18:51,895 --> 00:18:53,596
You know,
"All rehearsals are closed."

00:18:53,663 --> 00:18:56,967
So I got up.

00:18:57,033 --> 00:19:01,805
And then he turns to me,
and he says, um...

00:19:03,773 --> 00:19:05,342
"Go ahead and stay."

00:19:05,408 --> 00:19:06,743
Is there anything
on these tapes?

00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:08,278
Nothing.

00:19:08,345 --> 00:19:10,313
How's it going with the sheriff?

00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,748
He wants
to know why

00:19:11,815 --> 00:19:13,550
you're working
with young Greg.

00:19:13,617 --> 00:19:16,353
You could have had
Warrick, you know.

00:19:16,419 --> 00:19:17,921
Or asked Nick to help.

00:19:17,988 --> 00:19:19,289
I need someone
without an agenda.

00:19:19,356 --> 00:19:20,290
Like when Fung

00:19:20,357 --> 00:19:21,524
brought in Mazzola?

00:19:22,492 --> 00:19:24,027
Everybody lost.

00:19:24,094 --> 00:19:25,795
This isn't O.J.
Could be.

00:19:25,862 --> 00:19:27,931
A trainee on a career case...

00:19:27,998 --> 00:19:29,599
I know what I'm doing.

00:19:32,068 --> 00:19:33,303
SARA:
12 missing
girls so far

00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:35,705
over the last two years--
ten of them found dead.

00:19:35,772 --> 00:19:37,607
How many were models?

00:19:37,674 --> 00:19:39,776
Just this one.

00:19:39,843 --> 00:19:41,778
Robyn Knight.

00:19:41,845 --> 00:19:44,347
Day shift found her skeletal
remains six months ago.

00:19:47,284 --> 00:19:51,021
Washed up during heavy rains.

00:19:51,087 --> 00:19:52,789
Furnace Creek.

00:19:52,856 --> 00:19:55,091
Left in the morning

00:19:55,158 --> 00:19:56,693
for a photo shoot.

00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,295
Has a list of photographers

00:19:58,361 --> 00:20:00,764
in her day planner.

00:20:02,465 --> 00:20:04,100
Guess whose name is on the list?

00:20:04,167 --> 00:20:06,002
Howard Delhomme.

00:20:12,142 --> 00:20:14,344
Hey.

00:20:19,382 --> 00:20:21,017
How's it going?

00:20:21,084 --> 00:20:23,053
Your case.
You tell us.

00:20:26,222 --> 00:20:30,860
The odometer of the Maserati
had 142 miles on it.

00:20:30,927 --> 00:20:32,162
The car dealer
said that

00:20:32,228 --> 00:20:33,897
the vehicle only
had nine miles

00:20:33,964 --> 00:20:35,432
when Delhomme
picked it up.

00:20:35,498 --> 00:20:39,536
That means that Delhomme
drove it for 133 miles.

00:20:39,603 --> 00:20:40,971
If you do the math,

00:20:41,037 --> 00:20:44,007
that makes
the search radius

00:20:44,074 --> 00:20:45,842
approximately 66 miles.

00:20:45,909 --> 00:20:47,711
Julie's vehicle was found
in the parking lot

00:20:47,777 --> 00:20:50,814
of Dante's Pizza,
off Boulder Highway.

00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,616
That's what?
12 miles away?

00:20:52,682 --> 00:20:55,352
It's probably where
she hooked up with Delhomme.

00:20:55,418 --> 00:20:57,754
So they hopped in the car
and went to a photo shoot.

00:20:57,821 --> 00:20:59,956
If they did do
a photo shoot,

00:21:00,023 --> 00:21:01,291
and we don't even
know that they did.

00:21:01,358 --> 00:21:02,325
Where are the photos?

00:21:02,392 --> 00:21:04,694
I finished the DNA
from the car.

00:21:04,761 --> 00:21:05,829
It matches the reference

00:21:05,895 --> 00:21:07,364
Sara got from
Julie's apartment.

00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:09,633
And the snack shop?
It's the one on Granite's Pass.

00:21:11,434 --> 00:21:13,370
I also found out
what the household item

00:21:13,436 --> 00:21:15,372
was on the receipt.

00:21:15,438 --> 00:21:16,740
It was a shovel.

00:21:16,806 --> 00:21:19,409
He'd already killed her.

00:21:22,045 --> 00:21:24,014
That explains the blood
and the hair

00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,615
in the back seat
of the Maserati.

00:21:25,682 --> 00:21:27,784
He drove her body
to the snack bar

00:21:27,851 --> 00:21:30,020
and went back
and buried her.

00:21:30,086 --> 00:21:31,521
Question is, where?

00:21:38,795 --> 00:21:42,832
Robyn Knight washed up
near Furnace Creek.

00:21:51,174 --> 00:21:52,909
That's "Devil's Smile."

00:22:25,075 --> 00:22:27,644
I understand why
all these cadets are here.

00:22:27,711 --> 00:22:29,412
They have to be.

00:22:29,479 --> 00:22:32,148
But what's up with all
these off-duty cops?

00:22:32,215 --> 00:22:34,551
Chance to be a hero.

00:22:34,618 --> 00:22:37,253
Girl's beautiful.

00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,656
These guys don't
get many chances.

00:22:39,723 --> 00:22:40,657
For what?

00:22:40,724 --> 00:22:43,593
To rescue a princess.

00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:46,329
CADET:
I think we may have
found something!

00:22:58,808 --> 00:23:01,511
Hey, hey!
Hold on.

00:23:01,578 --> 00:23:03,747
Nobody touch the crime scene.
We do this right.

00:23:11,721 --> 00:23:13,056
All right...

00:23:13,123 --> 00:23:15,091
I want you to search
every trash can,

00:23:15,158 --> 00:23:17,994
drainage ditch, dump site
between here and the city.

00:23:18,061 --> 00:23:19,596
We're looking for a shovel,
a purse,

00:23:19,663 --> 00:23:21,564
anything else that looks
like it belonged to her.

00:23:26,202 --> 00:23:29,139
NICK:
Okay, Greg, diagram
every rock on the pile.

00:23:29,205 --> 00:23:30,941
By trial time,
defense will make us

00:23:31,007 --> 00:23:33,009
recreate this whole crime scene.

00:24:32,936 --> 00:24:34,137
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:24:35,605 --> 00:24:37,140
Sleeping beauty.

00:25:05,468 --> 00:25:07,003
Julie Waters.

00:25:10,206 --> 00:25:11,775
Nature preserved her.

00:25:11,841 --> 00:25:15,312
<i>Loose, sandy soil, shady area,</i>
<i>November temperatures--</i>

00:25:15,378 --> 00:25:16,947
<i>it was like a freezer.</i>

00:25:24,487 --> 00:25:25,889
A girl this beautiful

00:25:25,956 --> 00:25:27,490
wouldn't zip
up this far.

00:25:32,195 --> 00:25:35,131
She's not wearing
any makeup.

00:25:35,198 --> 00:25:37,801
Maybe he cleaned her.

00:25:37,867 --> 00:25:39,669
Yeah, and then he used
these rocks to cover her

00:25:39,736 --> 00:25:41,237
so that she wouldn't
wash up in a storm

00:25:41,304 --> 00:25:42,672
the way the other girl did.

00:25:42,739 --> 00:25:44,140
What other girl?

00:25:44,207 --> 00:25:45,842
We think there
may be a connection

00:25:45,909 --> 00:25:47,978
to the Robyn Knight case
from last year.

00:25:51,514 --> 00:25:53,083
Can we prove it?

00:25:53,149 --> 00:25:55,018
Well, only skeletal remains
were found.

00:25:55,085 --> 00:25:56,353
There's nothing definitive

00:25:56,419 --> 00:25:58,088
to connect Delhomme
to the murder.

00:25:58,154 --> 00:26:01,391
Then we better
make this one stick.

00:26:05,862 --> 00:26:08,098
BRASS:
You lost your
bargaining chip.

00:26:08,164 --> 00:26:09,699
We found her body.

00:26:09,766 --> 00:26:11,034
And smart, too.

00:26:11,101 --> 00:26:12,936
MAN:
I advise you
to remain silent.

00:26:15,672 --> 00:26:16,873
Howard,

00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:20,010
just help us with one thing.

00:26:20,076 --> 00:26:22,112
How did this happen?

00:26:22,178 --> 00:26:25,348
BRASS:
You're pretty
composed, Howard.

00:26:25,415 --> 00:26:26,683
I mean, you kill her,

00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:30,287
you go buy a
shovel, a soda.

00:26:30,353 --> 00:26:32,822
It's thirsty work,
digging a grave, huh?

00:26:32,889 --> 00:26:35,158
That's not how it happened.

00:26:35,225 --> 00:26:36,793
I understand.

00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:39,296
Photographer. Model.

00:26:39,362 --> 00:26:42,465
Had to get the light just right.

00:26:42,532 --> 00:26:43,900
I'd like to photograph you.

00:26:43,967 --> 00:26:48,305
Mmm... can't do anything
until we figure this out.

00:26:54,577 --> 00:26:56,379
It was an accident.

00:26:58,481 --> 00:27:00,150
I wanted to move

00:27:00,216 --> 00:27:03,586
the car... and I didn't see her.

00:27:09,392 --> 00:27:11,728
Why was she even there?

00:27:11,795 --> 00:27:13,797
Miss Waters had modeled
for my client

00:27:13,863 --> 00:27:15,098
on previous occasions.

00:27:15,165 --> 00:27:18,101
Well, the problem
I have with that

00:27:18,168 --> 00:27:21,771
is the dealer representative
specifically stated

00:27:21,838 --> 00:27:25,942
that no model was hired
to appear in the photos.

00:27:28,445 --> 00:27:32,248
I was shooting...
new head shots for her.

00:27:32,315 --> 00:27:33,917
She was all out.

00:27:33,984 --> 00:27:35,518
It was a favor.

00:27:35,585 --> 00:27:37,253
I'm a professional.

00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,189
Ask any of my models.

00:27:39,255 --> 00:27:42,092
So, you took photographs
of Julie?

00:27:42,158 --> 00:27:43,026
A couple of rolls.

00:27:43,093 --> 00:27:44,461
Any idea where they are?

00:27:47,597 --> 00:27:49,366
Mmm... no.

00:27:49,432 --> 00:27:52,202
Well, if
you remember,

00:27:52,269 --> 00:27:54,237
let me know.

00:27:54,304 --> 00:27:56,172
Okay.

00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:03,413
She has no injuries
consistent with a car accident.

00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,283
Cause of death
is, uh, positional asphyxia.

00:28:06,349 --> 00:28:07,951
( <i>screaming</i> )

00:28:11,154 --> 00:28:13,823
Guy we're looking
at was 180-plus.

00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:15,358
Sufficient weight.

00:28:15,425 --> 00:28:19,562
He must have hit her, which
ripped her earring out.

00:28:19,629 --> 00:28:21,331
Occurred antemortem.

00:28:22,499 --> 00:28:23,833
<i>Close to time of death.</i>

00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,635
<i>Only bleeding injury.</i>

00:28:25,702 --> 00:28:28,638
Was there any evidence
of sexual assault?

00:28:28,705 --> 00:28:30,140
Lots of trauma.

00:28:30,206 --> 00:28:31,808
Collected a kit.

00:28:31,875 --> 00:28:33,176
Anything else?

00:28:33,243 --> 00:28:34,477
Yeah, tox came back

00:28:34,544 --> 00:28:37,747
with a blood alcohol
content of .18.

00:28:37,814 --> 00:28:38,882
On the day of her dinner

00:28:38,949 --> 00:28:40,917
with the producers
of <i>Real Vegas Showgirls,</i>

00:28:40,984 --> 00:28:43,653
she'd be like Dorothy
racing for Oz.

00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,689
There's no way that
she slowed down to get drunk.

00:28:45,755 --> 00:28:48,825
Decomposing blood can generate
ethanol postmortem.

00:28:48,892 --> 00:28:50,126
<i>As the cell walls lyse</i>

00:28:50,193 --> 00:28:52,362
<i>and contact</i>
<i>with the sugar in alcohol,</i>

00:28:52,429 --> 00:28:54,764
<i>bacterial growth</i>
<i>produces the byproducts</i>

00:28:54,831 --> 00:28:56,600
<i>of carbon dioxide and ethanol.</i>

00:28:56,666 --> 00:28:59,569
It's inexact, but the body's
capable of producing

00:28:59,636 --> 00:29:03,273
somewhere around .08 grams
percent on its own.

00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:06,009
But in order to have
a postmortem level of .18...

00:29:06,076 --> 00:29:07,677
Well, she had a head start.

00:29:07,744 --> 00:29:10,180
So, that's three shots
in an hour?

00:29:10,246 --> 00:29:12,449
He could have forced
her to drink.

00:29:12,515 --> 00:29:14,117
Robbins rushed
the protocol.

00:29:14,184 --> 00:29:16,386
Released Julie's
body to her parents.

00:29:16,453 --> 00:29:18,588
So they could take
her home to Provo.

00:29:18,655 --> 00:29:20,590
Mmm.

00:29:20,657 --> 00:29:22,826
Thousands of girls come
to Vegas every year

00:29:22,892 --> 00:29:24,427
just hoping to
beat the odds.

00:29:26,096 --> 00:29:27,497
Mmm. Some of them do.

00:29:27,564 --> 00:29:28,632
And some of them don't.

00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:35,372
Multiple abrasions
on her cervix.

00:29:35,438 --> 00:29:38,475
Sexual assault kit had no semen,
no trace evidence.

00:29:38,541 --> 00:29:42,512
So, it's possible he used
a foreign object on her.

00:29:42,579 --> 00:29:44,781
Now I'm confused.

00:29:44,848 --> 00:29:49,185
Julie Waters died
of positional asphyxia.

00:29:49,252 --> 00:29:54,391
That means that someone
sat on her chest, and...

00:29:54,457 --> 00:29:58,528
two years ago, you were arrested
for forced oral cop.

00:29:58,595 --> 00:30:01,031
You don't think I'd ever do
something like that, do you?

00:30:01,097 --> 00:30:02,399
My client went to trial

00:30:02,465 --> 00:30:04,067
and was found
not guilty.

00:30:04,134 --> 00:30:05,568
HOWARD:
I liked Julie.

00:30:05,635 --> 00:30:07,737
I took a lot
of photographs of her.

00:30:07,804 --> 00:30:09,239
Even Julie's mother said

00:30:09,306 --> 00:30:12,208
that no one ever captured her
on film the way I did.

00:30:12,275 --> 00:30:14,311
Just one

00:30:14,377 --> 00:30:17,681
more thing
from the autopsy report.

00:30:17,747 --> 00:30:19,516
Julie was drinking.

00:30:21,918 --> 00:30:23,820
She wanted to loosen up,
you know?

00:30:25,288 --> 00:30:26,523
( <i>laughing</i> )

00:30:26,589 --> 00:30:28,124
You got what you needed.

00:30:28,191 --> 00:30:29,659
Now, get what you want.

00:30:29,726 --> 00:30:30,994
Come on.

00:30:31,061 --> 00:30:33,296
She never said stop.

00:30:33,363 --> 00:30:36,366
Why didn't you
tell me this before?

00:30:36,433 --> 00:30:40,103
I was afraid
of what you'd think of me.

00:30:42,472 --> 00:30:44,774
The sheriff has tried my client
in the media.

00:30:44,841 --> 00:30:47,944
But, right now, evidence that
will exonerate Howard Delhomme

00:30:48,011 --> 00:30:49,279
from these false charges

00:30:49,346 --> 00:30:51,448
is being handed over
to the authorities.

00:30:51,514 --> 00:30:52,449
RECEPTIONIST:
CSI Willows,

00:30:52,515 --> 00:30:53,783
you have a visitor
at the front desk.

00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:54,884
Willows, you have a visitor...

00:30:54,951 --> 00:30:56,386
My brother sent
this to me,

00:30:56,453 --> 00:30:58,855
and his attorney told
me to give it to you.

00:30:58,922 --> 00:31:00,457
Just set it on the counter.

00:31:00,523 --> 00:31:01,791
Could you please get me

00:31:01,858 --> 00:31:03,927
a pair of gloves
and an evidence bag?

00:31:03,994 --> 00:31:05,929
Sure.
Thanks.

00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:09,165
I can show you what's in there.

00:31:09,232 --> 00:31:10,900
Okay.

00:31:12,135 --> 00:31:14,738
When did
you get this?

00:31:14,804 --> 00:31:16,006
Today.

00:31:16,072 --> 00:31:17,474
It was mailed
two days ago.

00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:18,942
There's no
return address.

00:31:19,009 --> 00:31:21,678
How do you know
your brother sent this?

00:31:21,745 --> 00:31:23,413
That's his handwriting.

00:31:25,215 --> 00:31:26,650
Was there a note
in the envelope?

00:31:26,716 --> 00:31:28,485
Yeah. Uh...

00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:37,927
"If I get arrested..."

00:31:37,994 --> 00:31:39,929
Now, why would he think that?

00:31:50,907 --> 00:31:54,878
How are these supposed
to help him beat a murder rap?

00:31:54,945 --> 00:31:58,214
I'm guessing
he's trying to
create an alibi.

00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:04,854
Four rolls,
all of Julie.

00:32:04,921 --> 00:32:07,357
Something's
off, though.

00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:12,395
White shoes,
black stockings,
and all ripped up.

00:32:12,462 --> 00:32:15,065
Not to mention these
aren't the clothes

00:32:15,131 --> 00:32:16,633
that we found her in.

00:32:22,439 --> 00:32:24,541
Now, what is this?

00:32:24,608 --> 00:32:26,343
It's a nude.

00:32:26,409 --> 00:32:29,512
Is that Julie's body?

00:32:29,579 --> 00:32:31,581
If it is,
it's a double exposure.

00:32:31,648 --> 00:32:34,284
I'll have to get them printed
to be sure.

00:32:34,351 --> 00:32:35,552
Cadet got a hit

00:32:35,619 --> 00:32:36,720
off a trash can.

00:32:36,786 --> 00:32:37,887
I brought it in.

00:32:37,954 --> 00:32:39,756
You want me to get Greg?

00:32:41,324 --> 00:32:44,995
Archie, let me know when
you've got these printed up.

00:32:45,061 --> 00:32:46,896
Yeah.

00:33:01,444 --> 00:33:02,746
There's a lot
of head shots here.

00:33:05,582 --> 00:33:06,983
WILLOWS:
Here's our little lie.

00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:09,552
Delhomme said that he took her
out to photograph her

00:33:09,619 --> 00:33:11,254
because she had
no more head shots.

00:33:11,321 --> 00:33:13,256
Needed new ones.

00:33:16,426 --> 00:33:19,296
Explains how he cleaned her up.

00:33:23,566 --> 00:33:25,268
Doesn't explain why.

00:33:26,736 --> 00:33:28,505
Here's her day planner.

00:33:33,176 --> 00:33:35,211
There's only

00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:37,714
two things written
in her book the day
she disappeared--

00:33:37,781 --> 00:33:40,884
<i>Real Vegas Showgirl</i>
producer's dinner 7:00 p.m."

00:33:40,951 --> 00:33:43,920
And the other--
"Meet Howard,

00:33:43,987 --> 00:33:46,056
Dante's Pizza, 2:00 p.m."

00:33:46,122 --> 00:33:47,657
That would have given her
plenty of time

00:33:47,724 --> 00:33:49,225
to get back
for the producer's dinner.

00:33:49,292 --> 00:33:51,995
Here's her clothes.

00:33:58,101 --> 00:33:59,603
First thing you learn
as a model--

00:33:59,669 --> 00:34:01,771
bring several outfits with you.

00:34:01,838 --> 00:34:04,874
You never know what
the photographer might like.

00:34:12,015 --> 00:34:13,316
Here's our big lie.

00:34:13,383 --> 00:34:16,586
Delhomme said
when she injured her earlobe,

00:34:16,653 --> 00:34:18,622
she was in
her underwear

00:34:18,688 --> 00:34:20,790
and she was barefoot.

00:34:23,693 --> 00:34:26,329
I think Howard's
been lying to you.

00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:36,172
$65? Ooh.

00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,174
Capital investment.

00:34:38,241 --> 00:34:41,111
Our victim hadn't made
it to the show yet.

00:34:41,177 --> 00:34:43,813
Her life was all
about after the show.

00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,548
The right guy,

00:34:45,615 --> 00:34:48,218
the right meal,
and, after that...

00:34:48,285 --> 00:34:50,120
It's a tough way to get ahead.

00:34:50,186 --> 00:34:52,656
Did your father ever tell you

00:34:52,722 --> 00:34:54,724
you were pretty?

00:34:54,791 --> 00:34:56,026
I guess.

00:34:56,092 --> 00:34:57,060
He ever tell you

00:34:57,127 --> 00:34:58,194
you were smart?

00:34:58,261 --> 00:34:59,362
Yeah.

00:34:59,429 --> 00:35:01,331
So, it probably
never occurred to you

00:35:01,398 --> 00:35:03,133
that you wouldn't be successful.

00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:04,467
If all you

00:35:04,534 --> 00:35:06,569
ever hear
is that you're gorgeous,

00:35:06,636 --> 00:35:08,305
you can let everything else

00:35:08,371 --> 00:35:11,841
fall away, and it can leave you
in a very dangerous place.

00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:15,345
All right,

00:35:15,412 --> 00:35:18,481
the bloodstain
on the top of the foot

00:35:18,548 --> 00:35:20,917
is round.

00:35:20,984 --> 00:35:22,152
Gravitational.

00:35:22,218 --> 00:35:23,653
On the bottom of the foot,

00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,788
it's smeared.

00:35:24,854 --> 00:35:25,855
There's no blood in these.

00:35:25,922 --> 00:35:26,890
She wasn't wearing them.

00:35:26,957 --> 00:35:29,459
The only way
we can get this guy

00:35:29,526 --> 00:35:33,463
is if the evidence counters
every one of his lies.

00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:48,712
That matches the drop

00:35:48,778 --> 00:35:50,447
on the top of
her stocking.

00:35:50,513 --> 00:35:53,049
Separate bloodstain.

00:35:53,116 --> 00:35:54,951
Separate drop.

00:36:07,397 --> 00:36:08,832
She was standing.

00:36:16,106 --> 00:36:19,576
And there was no one
to help her.

00:36:21,144 --> 00:36:23,213
This is from the
fifth roll of film

00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,948
Delhomme took
with your vic.

00:36:25,015 --> 00:36:27,484
STOKES:
It's a double exposure.

00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:30,153
It's two separate images.

00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:32,188
Separate them.

00:36:34,557 --> 00:36:35,792
Do you have Catherine's

00:36:35,859 --> 00:36:37,227
crime scene photos
of the car?

00:36:37,294 --> 00:36:38,461
Mm-hmm.

00:36:39,496 --> 00:36:41,431
Just give me
the instrument panel

00:36:41,498 --> 00:36:44,601
and put it side-by-side
with the double-exposed

00:36:44,668 --> 00:36:45,602
instrument panel.

00:36:45,669 --> 00:36:47,837
( <i>beep</i> )

00:36:49,306 --> 00:36:51,341
Now just the speedometers.

00:36:59,015 --> 00:37:01,051
Does that look like
the same car to you?

00:37:03,053 --> 00:37:05,188
SIDLE:
She looks fine here.

00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:09,059
And here, it's like

00:37:09,125 --> 00:37:11,328
she's not quite sure
what's going on.

00:37:11,394 --> 00:37:14,164
Then here, uh...

00:37:15,532 --> 00:37:18,001
She knew.

00:37:18,068 --> 00:37:19,536
We have

00:37:19,603 --> 00:37:22,372
looked through every piece
of evidence on this case.

00:37:22,439 --> 00:37:25,108
Whatever caused
these abrasions is gone.

00:37:25,175 --> 00:37:26,610
Well, it's got to be here.

00:37:26,676 --> 00:37:28,678
We found this guy in pieces,
and he's been

00:37:28,745 --> 00:37:30,347
putting himself together
ever since.

00:37:30,413 --> 00:37:32,882
If we don't find something,
he's going to walk out of here

00:37:32,949 --> 00:37:34,684
and forget about this
like a bad dream.

00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:37,120
Hey, y'all.

00:37:37,187 --> 00:37:38,188
I got something

00:37:38,254 --> 00:37:40,156
on the double-exposed
roll of film.

00:37:42,525 --> 00:37:44,327
WILLOWS:
The odometers
don't match.

00:37:44,394 --> 00:37:46,062
STOKES:
No, on the left is you.

00:37:46,129 --> 00:37:48,298
Crime scene photo
from the Maserati.

00:37:48,365 --> 00:37:49,866
What about
the other one?

00:37:49,933 --> 00:37:51,101
Well, it's unknown.

00:37:51,167 --> 00:37:53,503
Must have used a picture
he already had

00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:55,105
for the double
exposure.

00:38:02,479 --> 00:38:04,581
Guys, if it's a different car,

00:38:04,648 --> 00:38:05,849
maybe it's a different girl.

00:38:05,915 --> 00:38:08,318
WILLOWS:
What's on the rest of
the double-exposed roll?

00:38:08,385 --> 00:38:10,420
A female body, naked.

00:38:10,487 --> 00:38:11,755
No face to go

00:38:11,821 --> 00:38:12,756
with an ID.

00:38:12,822 --> 00:38:14,257
Archie, do you have
the SART photos

00:38:14,324 --> 00:38:15,258
from the autopsy?

00:38:15,325 --> 00:38:16,359
Yeah.

00:38:16,426 --> 00:38:18,862
We need to
compare bodies.

00:38:24,067 --> 00:38:27,370
Uh... why don't you guys
take a break?

00:38:27,437 --> 00:38:28,405
Uh... it's okay.

00:38:28,471 --> 00:38:29,673
These photos don't bother me.

00:38:29,739 --> 00:38:31,541
They bother me.

00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:23,059
Well?

00:39:23,126 --> 00:39:25,962
The naked pictures
weren't of Julie.

00:39:26,029 --> 00:39:28,031
So, what? Delhomme fakes
a bunch of nude pictures

00:39:28,098 --> 00:39:29,332
and sends them to his brother?

00:39:29,399 --> 00:39:31,134
At this point, I don't
care why he did it.

00:39:31,201 --> 00:39:32,302
What do you have?

00:39:32,369 --> 00:39:33,470
Nothing.

00:39:33,536 --> 00:39:34,638
Absolutely nothing.

00:39:34,704 --> 00:39:36,473
If he raped her
with a foreign object,

00:39:36,539 --> 00:39:37,674
it is not on this table.

00:39:37,741 --> 00:39:40,076
Do you want me
to leave you alone

00:39:40,143 --> 00:39:41,978
so you can do it yourself?

00:39:44,314 --> 00:39:46,783
Look, the entire lab didn't need
to see pictures

00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:49,352
of Julie's vagina
plastered all over the screen.

00:39:49,419 --> 00:39:52,355
So, Nick and I
are the whole lab now?

00:39:52,422 --> 00:39:54,124
That's not it,

00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:56,326
Catherine, and you know it.

00:39:56,393 --> 00:39:58,862
I saw the look in Howard's eye.

00:39:58,928 --> 00:40:01,331
I used to make my living
off that look.

00:40:01,398 --> 00:40:04,267
He wanted me.
We needed him.

00:40:04,334 --> 00:40:06,836
I decided
to exploit that situation.

00:40:08,738 --> 00:40:11,141
And, as angry as
that made you,

00:40:11,207 --> 00:40:13,977
when you're in my shoes,
you'll do the same thing.

00:40:19,349 --> 00:40:22,018
I already checked that.

00:40:33,263 --> 00:40:36,066
We're looking
at the wrong evidence.

00:40:36,132 --> 00:40:39,603
His initial arrest was
for brandishing a firearm.

00:41:13,136 --> 00:41:15,205
I fired my lawyer.

00:41:15,272 --> 00:41:16,439
We waiting on a new one?

00:41:16,506 --> 00:41:17,841
No.

00:41:17,907 --> 00:41:19,142
( <i>dropping papers on table</i> )

00:41:19,209 --> 00:41:22,112
Is that what you like?

00:41:22,178 --> 00:41:24,214
Being alone with a woman?

00:41:25,348 --> 00:41:27,284
( <i>laughing</i> )

00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:29,519
One like you.

00:41:29,586 --> 00:41:32,789
Take her out
in the middle of nowhere.

00:41:32,856 --> 00:41:34,591
You know, I think I got to go.

00:41:37,027 --> 00:41:38,962
Howard, it's getting late.
I got to go.

00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:40,430
I have a meeting
back in town.

00:41:40,497 --> 00:41:42,966
She posed naked for me.

00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:46,503
My brother gave you
the pictures.

00:41:46,569 --> 00:41:50,173
I never forced her
to do anything.

00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,808
You slapped her.

00:41:51,875 --> 00:41:54,744
( <i>screaming</i> )

00:41:54,811 --> 00:41:56,479
Then you violated her.

00:41:56,546 --> 00:41:57,881
No more pictures.

00:41:58,915 --> 00:42:00,684
No more pictures.

00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:02,652
( <i>whimpering</i> )

00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:06,890
Julie Waters' cervical tissue
was on your gun sight.

00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:10,727
What's the matter?

00:42:10,794 --> 00:42:12,262
Couldn't swallow it

00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:14,931
when you saw her
all over the TV?

00:42:14,998 --> 00:42:15,665
( <i>loud grunt</i> )

00:42:15,732 --> 00:42:16,633
God.

00:42:19,002 --> 00:42:21,338
You bitch.

00:42:21,404 --> 00:42:23,907
You... <i>bitch!</i>

00:42:23,974 --> 00:42:27,844
( <i>panting</i> )

00:42:30,113 --> 00:42:32,282
FEMALE REPORTER:
Prosecutors will seek
a life sentence

00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:36,152
without the possibility
of parole for Howard Delhomme

00:42:36,219 --> 00:42:38,755
in the murder of Julie Waters.

00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:40,457
GRISSOM:
You did good, Cath.

00:42:40,523 --> 00:42:42,525
I had help.

00:42:44,527 --> 00:42:46,896
How are things with you
and Nick and Sara?

00:42:46,963 --> 00:42:48,898
They're good.

00:42:48,965 --> 00:42:51,368
They're pros.

00:42:51,434 --> 00:42:53,470
This case has been one
of the most high-profile

00:42:53,536 --> 00:42:55,138
in this reporter's memory.

00:42:55,205 --> 00:42:56,339
Never before have I seen...

00:42:56,406 --> 00:42:58,608
All he had to do was stay quiet.

00:42:58,675 --> 00:43:00,010
Unlike Robyn Knight,

00:43:00,076 --> 00:43:03,380
Julie Waters became Las Vegas'
postmortem sweetheart.

00:43:03,446 --> 00:43:06,016
...and beautiful
Julie Waters...

00:43:06,082 --> 00:43:08,184
The media as moral conscience.

00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:13,089
She couldn't get away
from him.

00:43:15,191 --> 00:43:18,461
Then he couldn't get away
from her.

00:43:18,528 --> 00:43:20,530
I think that is why
I would be perfect

00:43:20,597 --> 00:43:22,532
for your show.

00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:24,534
Well, at least,
that's what my dad thinks.

00:43:24,601 --> 00:43:26,736
He always says, "Julie,

00:43:26,803 --> 00:43:29,172
people can't help but love you."

00:43:31,374 --> 00:43:34,377
<i>And it's true.</i>
