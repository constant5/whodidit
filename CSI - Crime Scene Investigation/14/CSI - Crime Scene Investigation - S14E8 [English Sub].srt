00:00:04,422 --> 00:00:06,391
(dog barking in distance)

00:00:10,295 --> 00:00:12,530
(loud, rhythmic swishing)

00:00:17,557 --> 00:00:20,627
WOMAN:
We invite the Ritthamels for
wine and they don't show up?

00:00:20,627 --> 00:00:22,429
I mean, really,
what's next?

00:00:24,631 --> 00:00:26,366
MAN:
Honey...

00:00:26,366 --> 00:00:27,834
what's that?

00:00:27,834 --> 00:00:30,470
I don't think
that's the Ritthamels.

00:00:35,675 --> 00:00:36,810
Mother of...

00:00:40,814 --> 00:00:41,815
(squish)

00:00:41,815 --> 00:00:43,450
(woman shrieks)

00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:46,553
(siren wails)

00:00:46,553 --> 00:00:49,889
BRASS:
Male, Caucasian, in his 30s.

00:00:49,889 --> 00:00:52,225
And this
is how he rolls.

00:00:52,225 --> 00:00:55,695
PHILLIPS:
Volume of blood loss,
lack of visible cardio activity.

00:00:55,695 --> 00:00:56,896
He's definitely dead.

00:00:56,896 --> 00:00:58,431
Couldn't have
traveled far.

00:00:58,431 --> 00:01:01,234
These folks recognize him
as a neighbor?

00:01:01,234 --> 00:01:02,602
Yes, Bryce and Bunny.

00:01:02,602 --> 00:01:04,537
They never saw him before,
so police officers

00:01:04,537 --> 00:01:07,607
are knocking on doors
asking the neighbors if anyone

00:01:07,607 --> 00:01:09,275
witnessed his wild ride.

00:01:09,275 --> 00:01:10,877
Well, what
do you think, David?

00:01:10,877 --> 00:01:12,912
This doesn't look like
the kind of damage you'd get

00:01:12,912 --> 00:01:14,647
from just being
tumbled around, does it?

00:01:14,647 --> 00:01:15,849
I think you're right.

00:01:15,849 --> 00:01:18,718
Severe blunt-force injuries,

00:01:18,718 --> 00:01:20,253
primarily to the head and face.

00:01:20,253 --> 00:01:21,721
So, obviously a murder.

00:01:21,721 --> 00:01:24,424
Have you ever seen
anything like this?

00:01:24,424 --> 00:01:25,692
Actually, I have.

00:01:25,692 --> 00:01:27,961
It's a human hamster ball,
I believe.

00:01:27,961 --> 00:01:30,697
Saw one of these
at the state fair
with Charlie once.

00:01:30,697 --> 00:01:33,666
It's airtight, waterproof,
you can roll around in a pool

00:01:33,666 --> 00:01:34,701
for five bucks until

00:01:34,701 --> 00:01:36,903
you lose your corn dogs.

00:01:36,903 --> 00:01:38,838
BRASS:
State fair corn dogs.

00:01:38,838 --> 00:01:41,241
That sounds slightly more fun
than this guy's experience.

00:01:41,241 --> 00:01:42,842
All right, so we have
to figure out who he is,

00:01:42,842 --> 00:01:44,577
where he came from

00:01:44,577 --> 00:01:46,713
and what in the spinning world
happened to him.

00:01:46,713 --> 00:01:50,216
Our entire crime scene
is inside of this bubble, David,

00:01:50,216 --> 00:01:52,752
so I want you to get this back
to the coroner's office, intact.

00:01:52,752 --> 00:01:54,421
Seriously?

00:01:54,421 --> 00:01:56,523
Y-You want me to put <i>that...</i>

00:01:56,523 --> 00:01:57,690
in my van?

00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:59,459
That'd be nice.

00:02:01,761 --> 00:02:03,463
Have a ball.

00:02:03,463 --> 00:02:06,299

Heard you guys have a big,
bloody ball of bad to work on.

00:03:26,546 --> 00:03:29,249
(chuckles) Well, grave shift
always gets the good ones.

00:03:29,249 --> 00:03:31,251
MAN: Glad us swing shift
guys are done.

00:03:31,251 --> 00:03:33,286
Heard you got a sexual
assault call, too.

00:03:33,286 --> 00:03:34,621
Gonna be a
busy night.

00:03:34,621 --> 00:03:36,956
I'll drink my first one
for you, huh?

00:03:36,956 --> 00:03:38,858
Mm-hmm.
(laughs)

00:03:38,858 --> 00:03:40,860
Let him gloat.

00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,328
I don't really like anybody

00:03:42,328 --> 00:03:43,863
that goes to bed
before sunrise, anyways.

00:03:43,863 --> 00:03:45,365
Agreed.

00:03:45,365 --> 00:03:47,867
Hey, Morgan?
The sexual assault call.

00:03:47,867 --> 00:03:51,304
It's got to be our guy.
Similar victim and location.
Oh.

00:03:51,304 --> 00:03:53,339
Oh, sorry.
Dawn. Banks.

00:03:53,339 --> 00:03:55,842
Swing shift.
Hi. Seen you around. Greg.

00:03:55,842 --> 00:03:57,410
Hi.
Dawn and I worked separate

00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,345
home invasion rapes last week,

00:03:59,345 --> 00:04:01,347
realized we might be
dealing with a serial.
Yeah,

00:04:01,347 --> 00:04:03,416
looks like
he might have struck again.

00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:06,653
Do, uh, you mind
if I work this one with you?

00:04:06,653 --> 00:04:08,588
I don't sleep anyway.

00:04:08,588 --> 00:04:11,457
Oh, um, sure.
Great. I can head out
to the scene.

00:04:11,457 --> 00:04:13,760
The victim's waiting at PD.
All right,
I'll talk to her.

00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,828
Okay.

00:04:15,828 --> 00:04:17,430
Good luck.

00:04:20,767 --> 00:04:23,469
I didn't see him.

00:04:23,469 --> 00:04:26,372
I-I didn't hear him.

00:04:26,372 --> 00:04:27,607
I didn't know
anything happened

00:04:27,607 --> 00:04:29,375
until I woke up.

00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:31,678
Tell me what you can
about your night, Amy.

00:04:31,678 --> 00:04:34,948
What do you remember
before you went to bed?

00:04:34,948 --> 00:04:37,350
I got off work at 8:00.

00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:40,219
I'm-I'm a cocktail waitress.

00:04:40,219 --> 00:04:42,221
Fell asleep in bed watching TV.

00:04:42,221 --> 00:04:43,823
When I woke up,

00:04:43,823 --> 00:04:46,426
my head felt all cloudy.

00:04:49,662 --> 00:04:52,565
And... I was...

00:04:55,301 --> 00:04:56,636
...hurting.

00:04:56,636 --> 00:04:59,339
I promise you, Amy,

00:04:59,339 --> 00:05:01,708
we're not gonna stop until
we hunt this animal down.

00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:04,210
I saw something on the news,

00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:06,312
that a girl
got attacked last week

00:05:06,312 --> 00:05:08,715
a mile from my place.

00:05:08,715 --> 00:05:10,383
Was this the same guy?

00:05:13,886 --> 00:05:15,922
BANKS:
<i>I processed Amy's condo.</i>

00:05:15,922 --> 00:05:17,757
Point of entry
was the back door.

00:05:17,757 --> 00:05:20,827
The intruder used a bump key
to bust open the lock.

00:05:22,829 --> 00:05:25,465
Just like the other scenes.
Yeah, I found some rubble,

00:05:25,465 --> 00:05:27,233
crushed shells,
just like the last scene.

00:05:27,233 --> 00:05:28,935
Confirms it's the same guy.
Yeah. It's just,

00:05:28,935 --> 00:05:31,804
this stuff is used to pave
so many driveways around town.

00:05:31,804 --> 00:05:33,539
Could have picked
it up anywhere.

00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:37,477
Found a few small pebbles
of a different rocky material.

00:05:37,477 --> 00:05:40,847
Oh, and fibers from
a chloroform rag.

00:05:40,847 --> 00:05:42,915
He knocked Amy out,
just like the others.
And then,

00:05:42,915 --> 00:05:44,684
again with the TV.

00:05:44,684 --> 00:05:47,220
The rapist turns it on
and leaves it on.

00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,855
He actually didn't
turn it on at Amy's.

00:05:48,855 --> 00:05:51,624
She said she likes to
fall asleep to the news,

00:05:51,624 --> 00:05:52,892
so she left it on.

00:05:52,892 --> 00:05:54,761
So this time,
there's one less thing

00:05:54,761 --> 00:05:57,530
on his sick,
twisted to-do list.

00:06:03,903 --> 00:06:05,304
You know them?

00:06:05,304 --> 00:06:07,840
Yeah, I-I thought
it was my son, Tyler.

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,943
I bought him a jacket
like that last Christmas.

00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:15,782
He's 19. He comes home
every couple of weeks.

00:06:15,782 --> 00:06:17,717
I try to get him to stay,

00:06:17,717 --> 00:06:21,287
but then he wants to use in the
house, and then he's gone and...

00:06:22,722 --> 00:06:25,258
He's just out there.

00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:27,860
You said you don't sleep.

00:06:29,495 --> 00:06:30,763
You worry.

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,203
FINLAY:
No I.D. on our victim,
so we're hoping

00:06:37,203 --> 00:06:38,938
that the trace
from the outside of the ball

00:06:38,938 --> 00:06:40,540
will help us determine its path,

00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,709
and where it came from
will help us

00:06:42,709 --> 00:06:44,644
with who he is.

00:06:44,644 --> 00:06:47,647
Well, however bumpy his path,
that's not what killed him.

00:06:47,647 --> 00:06:50,516
Intracerebral hemorrhage
from blunt-force trauma

00:06:50,516 --> 00:06:52,819
is what bounced him
from this mortal coil.

00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:56,255
He was beaten with
some sort of hard implement.

00:06:56,255 --> 00:07:00,626
Small striking surface,
semicircular lacerations.
Hmm.

00:07:00,626 --> 00:07:02,895
There were marks in his
second skin, as well.

00:07:02,895 --> 00:07:04,297
Second skin?

00:07:04,297 --> 00:07:06,532
I think I missed
that anatomy class.

00:07:06,532 --> 00:07:08,601
The thin vinyl
of the ball was caught

00:07:08,601 --> 00:07:09,936
between the weapon
and the victim.

00:07:09,936 --> 00:07:12,572
So the victim was
inside the ball,

00:07:12,572 --> 00:07:14,307
the assailant
was outside of it.

00:07:14,307 --> 00:07:15,808
And the weapon made

00:07:15,808 --> 00:07:17,844
distinct tool marks
at the points of impact.

00:07:17,844 --> 00:07:19,946
What's the brown trace?

00:07:19,946 --> 00:07:21,514
Those are paint flecks.

00:07:21,514 --> 00:07:23,449
So, shape of the marks
plus the brown color

00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:25,351
could help us
identify the weapon.

00:07:25,351 --> 00:07:28,488
Well, at least something good
rolled this victim's way.

00:07:32,892 --> 00:07:36,229
Forensic nurse exam
was very helpful.

00:07:36,229 --> 00:07:37,530
A swab of Amy Morse's neck

00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:39,766
found male DNA
and amylase.

00:07:39,766 --> 00:07:42,702
He kissed her.
Yeah. Unfortunately,
there wasn't a hit in CODIS.

00:07:42,702 --> 00:07:45,238
But at least now
we have a profile on him.

00:07:45,238 --> 00:07:46,539
So, gets us a little closer.

00:07:46,539 --> 00:07:48,274
Just not close enough
to stop him.

00:07:49,675 --> 00:07:51,677
(indistinct muttering)

00:07:51,677 --> 00:07:53,646
You okay there,
Hodges?

00:07:53,646 --> 00:07:56,382
You're familiar with
the snowball effect?

00:07:56,382 --> 00:07:59,318
A sphere in motion
tumbles along,

00:07:59,318 --> 00:08:01,187
picking up mass?

00:08:01,187 --> 00:08:04,390
Yeah?
Well, the human
hamster ball effect is worse.

00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,792
Because it affects me.

00:08:05,792 --> 00:08:07,426
To the tune of 37

00:08:07,426 --> 00:08:08,961
different plant trace
exemplars,

00:08:08,961 --> 00:08:11,330
each of which
I am tasked with identifying.

00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:12,598
That sucks.

00:08:15,368 --> 00:08:16,402
I like you.

00:08:16,402 --> 00:08:18,704
Now, before
this avalanche

00:08:18,704 --> 00:08:21,574
came tumbling down on me,
I ran the very reasonable amount

00:08:21,574 --> 00:08:23,709
of trace that
you two brought me.

00:08:23,709 --> 00:08:26,479
Crushed shell, just like
at the previous scene.

00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,714
What about the other rubble we
found at the point of entry?

00:08:28,714 --> 00:08:30,449
A little more interesting.

00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:32,418
"Concrete and
titanium oxide."

00:08:32,418 --> 00:08:35,221
Otherwise known
as smog-eating concrete.

00:08:35,221 --> 00:08:37,757
A new, unique material
that helps reduce pollution.

00:08:37,757 --> 00:08:40,793
The chemical additive
is activated by sunlight

00:08:40,793 --> 00:08:43,362
and turns smoggy toxins into

00:08:43,362 --> 00:08:45,698
less-harmful compounds
upon contact.
So where in Vegas

00:08:45,698 --> 00:08:47,700
can this stuff be found?
It might help us

00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,436
find our assailant's
point of origin.

00:08:50,436 --> 00:08:51,971
It's in limited use nationally.

00:08:51,971 --> 00:08:53,573
Haven't had the chance
to determine

00:08:53,573 --> 00:08:56,576
if or where
it might be present in Vegas.

00:08:56,576 --> 00:08:58,277
I can look into it.
You're busy.

00:08:58,277 --> 00:09:01,380
Did I mention
my fondness for you?

00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,349
I like her.

00:09:05,418 --> 00:09:08,254
RUSSELL:
<i>All right, so where are we</i>
<i>on this rape case?</i>

00:09:08,254 --> 00:09:10,756
Victimology shows no links
between the three rape victims.

00:09:10,756 --> 00:09:13,492
None of them knew each other.
No shared routines.

00:09:13,492 --> 00:09:15,394
No overlaps in their lives.

00:09:15,394 --> 00:09:17,930
Other than being
this guy's type--

00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:20,700
early 20s,
single, brunette,

00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,269
living alone
in a first-floor condo.

00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:26,272
The M.O.'s consistent, right?
I mean, he waits until

00:09:26,272 --> 00:09:28,641
they're asleep, uses a bump key
on the back door lock

00:09:28,641 --> 00:09:30,376
to gain entry.
Except that

00:09:30,376 --> 00:09:32,778
at the first scene,
he passes a wide-open window

00:09:32,778 --> 00:09:34,380
he could've used for entry.

00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,382
He goes into
the victim's bedroom.

00:09:36,382 --> 00:09:38,317
Chloroforms her.

00:09:38,317 --> 00:09:39,886
Turns on the TV,

00:09:39,886 --> 00:09:42,755
leaving it on while
he assaults her.

00:09:42,755 --> 00:09:44,724
Actually, Amy already
had her television on,

00:09:44,724 --> 00:09:46,459
so he just
left it playing.

00:09:46,459 --> 00:09:48,227
RUSSELL:
What if it wasn't a coincidence?

00:09:48,227 --> 00:09:49,829
Maybe it's significant.

00:09:49,829 --> 00:09:52,965
You get the feeling that
he was more prepared with Amy?

00:09:52,965 --> 00:09:56,235
At the first scene,
he overlooked the open window.

00:09:56,235 --> 00:09:58,271
Second scene, he woke up a dog

00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,906
that got the neighbors
all excited.

00:09:59,906 --> 00:10:02,541
No missteps at Amy's house, and
he picked the one night a week

00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:04,176
that she gets out
of work early.

00:10:04,176 --> 00:10:05,544
He might've been
casing her home,

00:10:05,544 --> 00:10:06,846
known her habits.

00:10:06,846 --> 00:10:07,780
It's more than that.

00:10:10,283 --> 00:10:12,518
He knew he was gonna
have to use a bump key

00:10:12,518 --> 00:10:13,519
to break into Amy's house.

00:10:16,656 --> 00:10:20,426
<i>He knew that she</i>
<i>fell asleep with the TV on.</i>

00:10:20,426 --> 00:10:22,295
He re-created those conditions

00:10:22,295 --> 00:10:24,563
in the previous
two scenes, because...

00:10:24,563 --> 00:10:26,899
the first two rapes

00:10:26,899 --> 00:10:29,201
were rehearsals.

00:10:30,503 --> 00:10:32,405
Practice runs.

00:10:32,405 --> 00:10:35,374
I think Amy Morse was his
intended target the whole time.

00:10:46,819 --> 00:10:50,222
BRODY:
It could be anyone, Amy, um...

00:10:50,222 --> 00:10:52,591
A customer,
a coworker, a neighbor.

00:10:52,591 --> 00:10:55,594
Has anyone given you
unwanted attention?

00:10:55,594 --> 00:10:59,265
I thought this was some random
psycho attacking random women.

00:10:59,265 --> 00:11:01,300
Why would
I have known him?

00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,235
We now believe
the rapist

00:11:03,235 --> 00:11:05,771
may have targeted
you specifically.

00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,208
There is someone.

00:11:10,943 --> 00:11:14,513
My ex-boyfriend,
Jared... Wallace.

00:11:14,513 --> 00:11:17,516
When I broke up with him
a couple months ago,

00:11:17,516 --> 00:11:19,919
he turned awful.

00:11:21,454 --> 00:11:24,290
Started sending me
these e-mails.

00:11:30,196 --> 00:11:32,465
(voice breaking):
When I woke up...

00:11:32,465 --> 00:11:34,767
after, I...

00:11:36,669 --> 00:11:39,538
I could almost
smell him in the room.

00:11:39,538 --> 00:11:40,673
Jared?

00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:44,510
But it...

00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:47,880
it was so faint, I-I thought
I was imagining it, I...

00:11:50,349 --> 00:11:52,852
We're gonna need to get
a DNA sample from Jared.

00:11:52,852 --> 00:11:55,788
Do you have anything from
when you guys were dating?

00:11:55,788 --> 00:11:58,691
Hairbrush, um,
article of clothing...

00:11:58,691 --> 00:12:02,361
I just wanted
to forget him.

00:12:02,361 --> 00:12:04,597
Are you even sure
her story's legit?

00:12:04,597 --> 00:12:06,365
Amy's a cocktail waitress.

00:12:06,365 --> 00:12:08,801
That's kind of how she makes
money--leading guys on.

00:12:08,801 --> 00:12:10,536
She takes one home
and if she regrets it,

00:12:10,536 --> 00:12:12,538
buff one of the hundred
notches out of the bedpost

00:12:12,538 --> 00:12:13,773
but don't call the cops.

00:12:13,773 --> 00:12:15,207
Enough, Jared.

00:12:15,207 --> 00:12:16,342
He doesn't mean that.

00:12:16,342 --> 00:12:17,676
This is just
a stressful situation.

00:12:17,676 --> 00:12:19,278
Look, Jared,

00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:20,846
we're just going to take
a swab of your DNA,

00:12:20,846 --> 00:12:21,881
and then you're
free to go.

00:12:21,881 --> 00:12:23,516
Yeah, I don't think so.

00:12:23,516 --> 00:12:24,850
It'll only take
a second.

00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:26,852
And last a lifetime
in your database.

00:12:26,852 --> 00:12:30,423
I said no, and you can't force
me unless you have a warrant.

00:12:30,423 --> 00:12:32,625
Mr. Wallace,

00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:34,760
as your son's attorney,
perhaps you should advise...

00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,596
I already told
him no, too.
Wait a minute.

00:12:37,596 --> 00:12:41,667
As his attorney, I have
to support his decision.

00:12:43,602 --> 00:12:45,337
Well, as his dad,
don't you think

00:12:45,337 --> 00:12:47,440
you should tell him
to man the hell up?

00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,243
Parent protects his kid
no matter what...

00:12:51,243 --> 00:12:53,846
disgusting thing
the kid has done.

00:12:53,846 --> 00:12:55,648
Dad can't see it.

00:12:55,648 --> 00:12:57,583
Little boy who used
to sit on his lap

00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:59,485
couldn't be capable
of something so awful.

00:13:00,786 --> 00:13:03,389
And if you are
clear-eyed enough

00:13:03,389 --> 00:13:05,257
to see what he has done,

00:13:05,257 --> 00:13:07,326
what does that say about
how you raised him?

00:13:08,694 --> 00:13:10,696
JARED:
Dad, come on,

00:13:10,696 --> 00:13:11,764
let's get out of here.

00:13:11,764 --> 00:13:12,832
BANKS:
Hey!

00:13:12,832 --> 00:13:14,433
You thought

00:13:14,433 --> 00:13:17,636
you got whatever you wanted,
including Amy,

00:13:17,636 --> 00:13:19,772
and when you lost her,
well...

00:13:19,772 --> 00:13:22,174
If we're wrong, prove it.

00:13:22,174 --> 00:13:23,175
Are you kidding me?

00:13:23,175 --> 00:13:25,311
You raped her, Jared.

00:13:25,311 --> 00:13:26,912
(grunts)

00:13:26,912 --> 00:13:29,415
MR. WALLACE:
Jared, no, no,
Jared, Jared, Jared.

00:13:29,415 --> 00:13:30,749
Jared.
You don't know

00:13:30,749 --> 00:13:31,851
who you're messing with.

00:13:40,926 --> 00:13:42,695
You were hoping
he would spit at you, right?

00:13:42,695 --> 00:13:44,663
Big loogie in the face
would have been nice,

00:13:44,663 --> 00:13:46,365
but at least
a good look

00:13:46,365 --> 00:13:47,967
in his eyes let me know
we're right about him.

00:13:52,638 --> 00:13:55,274
Leave the prop alone.

00:13:55,274 --> 00:13:56,609
You guys got something
to show me?

00:13:56,609 --> 00:13:57,743
Yes.
(clears throat)

00:13:57,743 --> 00:13:59,512
Now, you know

00:13:59,512 --> 00:14:02,414
that a rolling stiff gathers
no moss, but it does gather

00:14:02,414 --> 00:14:05,518
an exhaustive
assortment of flora.

00:14:05,518 --> 00:14:07,920
That is the plant trace that
we took off of the big ball--

00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,889
Hodges I.D.'d it--

00:14:09,889 --> 00:14:11,524
and this is
a landscaping map

00:14:11,524 --> 00:14:13,392
that we got
from the subdivision's gardener.

00:14:13,392 --> 00:14:15,327
Each blade and bloom

00:14:15,327 --> 00:14:16,929
meticulously plotted
and labeled.

00:14:16,929 --> 00:14:18,797
RUSSELL:
So you're looking
for one route--

00:14:18,797 --> 00:14:20,699
probably downhill--

00:14:20,699 --> 00:14:22,935
that makes contact with each
of the plant varieties

00:14:22,935 --> 00:14:27,940
until it ends up in our
unfortunate couple's front yard.

00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:30,776
Took us 17 hours without a
bathroom break, but we did it.

00:14:30,776 --> 00:14:32,778
So we tracked the ball

00:14:32,778 --> 00:14:36,382
to its point of origin--
the backyard

00:14:36,382 --> 00:14:37,883
of one Zack Fisk.

00:14:42,388 --> 00:14:44,790
The human
hamster himself,

00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,892
rest his cardboard-
chewing soul.

00:14:52,798 --> 00:14:54,500
RUSSELL:
<i>Back door's open.</i>

00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,403
Wide enough for the
hamster ball to roll out.

00:14:57,403 --> 00:14:59,305
FINLAY:
Look at these fresh scuffs.

00:14:59,305 --> 00:15:01,307
Right height for the ball.

00:15:01,307 --> 00:15:03,943
So the ball knocks over
the vase,

00:15:03,943 --> 00:15:08,480
spreads water over the carpet,
does a few donuts right here,

00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,915
and out the door.

00:15:09,915 --> 00:15:11,884
That is one hell of a ride

00:15:11,884 --> 00:15:13,586
before he even got out
of the house.

00:15:15,854 --> 00:15:18,390
He was trying to escape

00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:20,392
from whoever was wielding this.

00:15:20,392 --> 00:15:24,330
Same shape as the impressions
left in the hamster ball's skin.

00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:26,865
<i>Paint must have rubbed off</i>
<i>during the assault.</i>

00:15:26,865 --> 00:15:29,735
(grunting)

00:15:31,804 --> 00:15:33,439
Texture's not
really conducive

00:15:33,439 --> 00:15:34,673
to prints.

00:15:34,673 --> 00:15:36,308
Hmm.

00:15:36,308 --> 00:15:37,810
Killer might have left
this little bit

00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:40,512
of trace behind.

00:15:41,714 --> 00:15:43,249
Hey, Jules,

00:15:43,249 --> 00:15:46,318
I think I just found
this guy's romper room.

00:15:46,318 --> 00:15:48,587
Ugh,

00:15:48,587 --> 00:15:50,756
all kinds of freaky fun.

00:15:52,725 --> 00:15:54,727
RUSSELL:
Don't suppose

00:15:54,727 --> 00:15:56,462
he'll mind us looking
at his computer,

00:15:56,462 --> 00:15:57,463
do you?

00:15:58,664 --> 00:16:02,268
"ConfinedBliss.com--

00:16:02,268 --> 00:16:04,470
a claustrophilia oasis."
I guess

00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:06,705
that's the opposite
of claustrophobia, right?

00:16:06,705 --> 00:16:08,907
People who get off
on tight spaces.

00:16:08,907 --> 00:16:09,875
Zack Fisk

00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:12,411
is in every video.

00:16:12,411 --> 00:16:14,446
Well, let's go
to the movies.

00:16:14,446 --> 00:16:16,415
A ball like this,
with a two-way zipper,

00:16:16,415 --> 00:16:20,419
is perfect for solo
or partner play.

00:16:20,419 --> 00:16:22,521
When sealed up,
the ball contains

00:16:22,521 --> 00:16:25,824
20 minutes' worth of oxygen, so,

00:16:25,824 --> 00:16:29,228
in 15 minutes,
the air will be thinning

00:16:29,228 --> 00:16:32,498
and my lovely playmate
will be...

00:16:32,498 --> 00:16:34,500
in bliss.

00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,969
Claustrophilia can bring you

00:16:36,969 --> 00:16:40,939
to full
sensory nirvana.

00:16:40,939 --> 00:16:44,209
The lack of space,
of oxygen makes you

00:16:44,209 --> 00:16:46,912
deliciously aware
of every inch

00:16:46,912 --> 00:16:50,282
and impulse
of your body.

00:16:50,282 --> 00:16:53,652
With the strictest
of boundaries

00:16:53,652 --> 00:16:57,456
comes the most exhilarating
liberation.

00:17:01,527 --> 00:17:03,762
Speaking of oxygen,
I could use a little.

00:17:03,762 --> 00:17:05,364
(sighs)

00:17:05,364 --> 00:17:08,233
Since Zack was killed
inside of the ball,

00:17:08,233 --> 00:17:10,402
his playmate's
a pretty good suspect, right?

00:17:10,402 --> 00:17:11,804
I'll figure out who she is.

00:17:11,804 --> 00:17:13,939
(doorbell rings)

00:17:13,939 --> 00:17:16,742
I got it.

00:17:23,515 --> 00:17:25,451
Hey, Jules.

00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,521
Yeah?

00:17:29,521 --> 00:17:31,390
Package delivered.

00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:34,927
Huh, big package shows up
a day after he's murdered.

00:17:34,927 --> 00:17:36,295
Could be connected.

00:17:36,295 --> 00:17:37,796
What do you think?
Should we open it?

00:17:37,796 --> 00:17:38,731
Yeah.

00:17:39,832 --> 00:17:42,301
Oh, Lord.

00:17:42,301 --> 00:17:45,571
Well, whatever new pervy toys
this guy just ordered,

00:17:45,571 --> 00:17:49,475
I think he went
with solid steel.

00:17:50,809 --> 00:17:52,378
(Finlay groans)

00:17:55,814 --> 00:17:58,283
That is no toy.

00:17:58,283 --> 00:18:00,319
No, that's his playmate.

00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,253
(closes knife)

00:18:08,894 --> 00:18:11,563
BRODY:
<i>Dawn, it's Morgan again,</i>
<i>following up on the case.</i>

00:18:11,563 --> 00:18:13,565
Uh, I really need
to hear from you.

00:18:13,565 --> 00:18:17,302
I'm just hoping
you're, you're okay.

00:18:17,302 --> 00:18:18,604
Please call me back.

00:18:18,604 --> 00:18:20,339
Bye.

00:18:20,339 --> 00:18:22,374
Everything all right?

00:18:22,374 --> 00:18:26,178
Oh, uh, Dawn Banks--

00:18:26,178 --> 00:18:27,679
she didn't show up
for her shift today.

00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,314
When's the last time
you talked to her?

00:18:29,314 --> 00:18:30,449
Yesterday,

00:18:30,449 --> 00:18:31,750
after she got
in the face

00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:34,787
of our rape suspect
Jared Wallace.

00:18:34,787 --> 00:18:37,523
Well, do you want
to do a welfare check,

00:18:37,523 --> 00:18:38,590
swing by her house?

00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:40,626
Yeah.

00:18:41,727 --> 00:18:43,662
Door's unlocked.

00:18:45,731 --> 00:18:47,666
Dawn?

00:18:49,535 --> 00:18:51,236
Looks like she left

00:18:51,236 --> 00:18:53,772
this place
in a hurry.

00:18:53,772 --> 00:18:56,442
Yeah.
She was working.

00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:00,846
She got a response
from a smog-eating

00:19:00,846 --> 00:19:04,683
concrete company last night.

00:19:04,683 --> 00:19:06,185
Rapist tracked
some of that stuff

00:19:06,185 --> 00:19:07,519
into the crime scenes, right?

00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:09,588
Yeah, and according
to this e-mail,

00:19:09,588 --> 00:19:14,359
this stuff only exists on one
half-mile strip of Verdugo Road.

00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:15,761
Good lead.

00:19:15,761 --> 00:19:17,362
(clattering)

00:19:18,831 --> 00:19:20,632
Dawn?

00:19:30,242 --> 00:19:31,176
(grunts)

00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:38,851
Aah! The hell are you guys
doing here, huh?!

00:19:38,851 --> 00:19:39,918
Who are you guys?

00:19:39,918 --> 00:19:40,853
We're CSIs.

00:19:42,354 --> 00:19:44,189
It's her son.

00:19:44,189 --> 00:19:46,191
Tyler?

00:19:46,191 --> 00:19:47,860
We work with your mom.

00:19:53,198 --> 00:19:55,501
So, when's the last time
you saw her?

00:19:56,869 --> 00:19:58,770
Look, I don't know
where she is.

00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:00,272
Okay, I haven't
been here in weeks.

00:20:00,272 --> 00:20:01,273
I just came to get a bite.

00:20:01,273 --> 00:20:02,741
Sure.

00:20:02,741 --> 00:20:04,943
If she got fed up with
me, everything else,

00:20:04,943 --> 00:20:07,212
ran off to the Bahamas or
something, good for her,

00:20:07,212 --> 00:20:08,847
she deserves it.

00:20:08,847 --> 00:20:12,184
Other than that, I don't
know what else to tell you.

00:20:12,184 --> 00:20:14,353
I'm gonna get out of here,
crash somewhere else.

00:20:14,353 --> 00:20:16,522
Uh, Tyler, wait.

00:20:16,522 --> 00:20:19,758
I know you have your own life
and everything, but

00:20:19,758 --> 00:20:21,727
I know your mom has been

00:20:21,727 --> 00:20:23,495
really, really
worried about you.

00:20:24,963 --> 00:20:27,366
I think you should stay.

00:20:27,366 --> 00:20:28,767
Yeah, I'm sure
she'd be happy to see you.

00:20:32,271 --> 00:20:34,206
Look, I'm sorry.

00:20:36,308 --> 00:20:37,943
If I see her,

00:20:37,943 --> 00:20:40,345
then I'll tell her someone
else is looking out for her.

00:20:42,614 --> 00:20:43,916
Thanks.

00:21:10,442 --> 00:21:12,611
YEAGER:
Hey, Brody, I heard
you're on the rape case.

00:21:12,611 --> 00:21:14,580
Stealing
the glory again?

00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,682
Day shift doesn't start
for another hour, Yeager.

00:21:16,682 --> 00:21:18,383
Go get your
breakfast buffet on.
No.

00:21:18,383 --> 00:21:20,452
No carbs
until I make CSI-3.

00:21:20,452 --> 00:21:22,854
Bumped into Sidle.

00:21:22,854 --> 00:21:25,424
She looped me in
on the rape investigation.

00:21:25,424 --> 00:21:26,825
So, what do you have?

00:21:26,825 --> 00:21:28,660
Uh, suspect tracked
two different materials

00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,661
into the scene.

00:21:29,661 --> 00:21:31,263
One was, uh, crushed shells

00:21:31,263 --> 00:21:33,265
and the other was a
smog-eating concrete,

00:21:33,265 --> 00:21:34,600
and I found one location

00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,602
where both of these
materials exist--

00:21:36,602 --> 00:21:38,670
this trailer park.
So you think

00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:40,439
the rapist may have
originated from there?

00:21:40,439 --> 00:21:41,773
Yeah, but it still
doesn't clear

00:21:41,773 --> 00:21:43,542
our prime suspect--
victim's ex

00:21:43,542 --> 00:21:44,910
Jared Wallace.

00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:46,478
Now, I thought he
was some rich kid,

00:21:46,478 --> 00:21:47,746
not some trailer type.

00:21:47,746 --> 00:21:49,448
Well, this particular
trailer park has

00:21:49,448 --> 00:21:50,949
a lot of drug activity,

00:21:50,949 --> 00:21:52,884
and Wallace has an ecstasy
charge on his record.

00:21:52,884 --> 00:21:54,252
Okay, so Wallace swings by

00:21:54,252 --> 00:21:55,654
to score something
before the rapes.

00:21:55,654 --> 00:21:57,589
There's something else.

00:21:57,589 --> 00:21:59,758
I think Dawn figured
this out before I did

00:21:59,758 --> 00:22:01,193
and now she's missing.

00:22:01,193 --> 00:22:02,661
Yeah, I heard--
no-show today.

00:22:02,661 --> 00:22:04,630
I've worked with her.

00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:06,732
That's not like Dawn.
Case had her amped,

00:22:06,732 --> 00:22:08,967
so I'm thinking maybe she
found the same location.

00:22:08,967 --> 00:22:11,603
Could be she ran
into our suspect.

00:22:11,603 --> 00:22:14,773
This e-mail was the last
thing up on her computer.

00:22:14,773 --> 00:22:17,376
Maybe she went
to follow up.

00:22:17,376 --> 00:22:19,344
Went to the
trailer park,

00:22:19,344 --> 00:22:20,712
and then...

00:22:20,712 --> 00:22:23,181
Oh, you think something
happened to her?

00:22:23,181 --> 00:22:24,349
I don't know.

00:22:24,349 --> 00:22:26,685
All right. I'll drive.

00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:35,360
Okay, the manager
did not recognize Dawn

00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,728
or Jared Wallace,

00:22:36,728 --> 00:22:39,331
but he said people
are in and out all hours.

00:22:39,331 --> 00:22:41,366
He give you a list
of the residents?

00:22:41,366 --> 00:22:42,534
No, he refused.

00:22:42,534 --> 00:22:44,202
Suggested we move along.

00:22:44,202 --> 00:22:45,504
(laughs)

00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,505
It's okay.

00:22:46,505 --> 00:22:48,740
We can do it another way.

00:22:50,175 --> 00:22:52,310
You trying Dawn again?

00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,679
Yeah.

00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,815
(distant cell phone ringing)

00:22:56,815 --> 00:22:58,583
Morgan.

00:22:59,651 --> 00:23:00,819
Try her again.

00:23:04,823 --> 00:23:07,893
(distant cell phone ringing)

00:23:13,665 --> 00:23:15,801
Nothing here.

00:23:15,801 --> 00:23:17,269
This way.

00:23:17,269 --> 00:23:18,503
(ringing stops)

00:23:37,556 --> 00:23:39,458
Where the hell is she?

00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,569
Time for the
"postal mortem"?

00:23:53,438 --> 00:23:56,441
(Finlay and Robbins
groan quietly)

00:23:56,441 --> 00:23:58,777
No I.D. from
prints or DNA.

00:23:58,777 --> 00:24:01,179
Well, lividity's fixed.

00:24:01,179 --> 00:24:03,381
It indicates her
orientation in the box.

00:24:03,381 --> 00:24:05,383
She was upside down.

00:24:05,383 --> 00:24:08,587
Hmm. So she was inverted
during transit.

00:24:08,587 --> 00:24:10,856
Well, autopsy will
confirm, but I'd venture

00:24:10,856 --> 00:24:13,925
positional asphyxia was likely
the cause of death.

00:24:13,925 --> 00:24:16,595
<i>Gravity causes the organs</i>

00:24:16,595 --> 00:24:19,831
<i>to impede</i>
<i>the diaphragmatic movement.</i>

00:24:19,831 --> 00:24:24,302
<i>No movement of the diaphragm,</i>
<i>no breathing, suffocation.</i>

00:24:24,302 --> 00:24:27,773
There aren't any wounds
evident on her.

00:24:27,773 --> 00:24:30,475
It doesn't appear she
was forced into the box.

00:24:30,475 --> 00:24:31,743
That's bizarre.

00:24:31,743 --> 00:24:32,878
Well, yes and no.

00:24:32,878 --> 00:24:35,447
This woman was
a claustrophiliac.

00:24:35,447 --> 00:24:37,616
Which means that
she liked to get off

00:24:37,616 --> 00:24:39,684
by getting into
tight spaces.

00:24:39,684 --> 00:24:43,321
The babe in the box
is named Melody Davis.

00:24:43,321 --> 00:24:45,624
The package was shipped
from her residence

00:24:45,624 --> 00:24:47,759
across town 36 hours ago.

00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:51,496
I also lifted some
prints from the label.

00:24:51,496 --> 00:24:54,266
Match to Zack Fisk.

00:24:55,467 --> 00:24:57,903
So Fisk sealed his playmate up

00:24:57,903 --> 00:25:01,640
at her house,
mailed her to his house

00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,341
to have a thrill?
There's a catch.

00:25:03,341 --> 00:25:07,646
Melody is married to a
guy named Roy Davis.

00:25:07,646 --> 00:25:11,449
Brass is breaking the news
and bringing him in.

00:25:11,449 --> 00:25:14,352
Your wife's death
was accidental.

00:25:14,352 --> 00:25:16,855
She got into that box
voluntarily--it's part of her...

00:25:16,855 --> 00:25:18,757
claustrophilia pursuits
that she indulged in

00:25:18,757 --> 00:25:21,493
with her friend Zack Fisk.

00:25:21,493 --> 00:25:23,695
But I suspect you knew
all about this, right?

00:25:23,695 --> 00:25:24,896
Yes, sir, I did.

00:25:24,896 --> 00:25:26,231
I allowed it...

00:25:26,231 --> 00:25:27,799
to save my marriage.

00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:29,534
She said she

00:25:29,534 --> 00:25:30,902
needed her space.

00:25:30,902 --> 00:25:32,737
Or... lack of space.

00:25:33,905 --> 00:25:35,807
She had met a man online,

00:25:35,807 --> 00:25:39,444
but she said it wasn't sex,
it was just... play.

00:25:39,444 --> 00:25:42,380
And a couple of hours after
your wife put herself in the box

00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,648
and mailed herself,
I guess you

00:25:43,648 --> 00:25:45,517
got online
and tracked the package

00:25:45,517 --> 00:25:47,619
on your home computer?
She had told me

00:25:47,619 --> 00:25:50,322
about her shipping
fantasy before.

00:25:50,322 --> 00:25:52,290
But I forbid it.

00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:54,693
It's far too
dangerous.

00:25:54,693 --> 00:25:57,229
But apparently, she
hadn't heeded me.

00:25:57,229 --> 00:25:59,631
You saw the package was
delivered to, uh, Zack Fisk,

00:25:59,631 --> 00:26:00,932
so you went over there

00:26:00,932 --> 00:26:02,868
and confronted
him, huh?
No, sir.

00:26:02,868 --> 00:26:04,569
That is not true.

00:26:04,569 --> 00:26:07,272
Roy, what, uh, what
line of work you in?

00:26:07,272 --> 00:26:10,542
(laughs softly)
I... work on a ranch.

00:26:10,542 --> 00:26:11,943
Horses.

00:26:11,943 --> 00:26:13,511
Wide-open spaces.
Yeah,

00:26:13,511 --> 00:26:15,213
see, that was
a trick question.

00:26:15,213 --> 00:26:17,249
We found a kernel

00:26:17,249 --> 00:26:20,252
of your special blend
of horse feed.

00:26:20,252 --> 00:26:22,554
It was stuck
to the murder weapon.

00:26:24,789 --> 00:26:28,560
I mean, you gave this guy
Fisk a lot of leeway

00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,862
with your own wife,

00:26:30,862 --> 00:26:33,398
but he had to push it,
right?

00:26:34,666 --> 00:26:36,601
He thought he was safe

00:26:36,601 --> 00:26:39,337
in that stupid bubble.

00:26:39,337 --> 00:26:41,306
So damn smug.

00:26:41,306 --> 00:26:44,476
I told you guys, that's
where I drew the line.

00:26:44,476 --> 00:26:46,778
If she gets hurt...
She's on the ride
of her life.

00:26:46,778 --> 00:26:48,813
More excitement than
you've ever given her.

00:26:48,813 --> 00:26:50,248
And you just
wait until

00:26:50,248 --> 00:26:52,550
she arrives,
and I get to tear into

00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:53,752
that pretty little package.

00:26:55,287 --> 00:26:57,756
(grunting)

00:26:57,756 --> 00:27:01,559
(Zach gasping, grunting)

00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:04,562
"It was just play,"
she told me.

00:27:04,562 --> 00:27:06,431
I'm sorry about
your wife, Roy.

00:27:06,431 --> 00:27:08,900
I really am.
Unfortunately,

00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:13,338
you're gonna have to share
her love of enclosed spaces.

00:27:19,711 --> 00:27:22,247
So, PD towed in Dawn's car.

00:27:22,247 --> 00:27:24,649
Found it roadside
in the middle of nowhere.

00:27:24,649 --> 00:27:27,452
Searched the immediate area--
nothing unusual,

00:27:27,452 --> 00:27:29,788
and no viable prints
on the outside.
Get to the inside yet?

00:27:29,788 --> 00:27:31,222
No, not yet.

00:27:31,222 --> 00:27:33,391
All right,
I'll take the front.

00:27:50,442 --> 00:27:51,710
I got a receipt...

00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:54,212
from a truck stop.

00:27:54,212 --> 00:27:56,247
1:00 a.m.,
the night she went missing.

00:27:56,247 --> 00:27:57,916
30 bucks.
Does it say what she bought?

00:28:07,592 --> 00:28:09,227
I've got an evidence bag.

00:28:09,227 --> 00:28:10,862
That looks like

00:28:10,862 --> 00:28:12,931
a T-shirt.

00:28:12,931 --> 00:28:14,632
Dawn might have gone rogue.

00:28:14,632 --> 00:28:16,768
You know, stealing a DNA
sample from Jared Wallace

00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:18,903
or maybe a suspect
from the trailer park.

00:28:18,903 --> 00:28:21,373
(sighs)

00:28:21,373 --> 00:28:24,275
The guy could've caught up
with her and...

00:28:24,275 --> 00:28:25,610
stopped her.

00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:27,846
I think the threat
was closer to home.

00:28:29,848 --> 00:28:32,384
Her suspect was her son.

00:28:43,795 --> 00:28:45,196
BRASS:
Tyler, your mom's car

00:28:45,196 --> 00:28:46,531
was found abandoned
on the highway.

00:28:46,531 --> 00:28:48,333
She was working
a serial rape case.

00:28:48,333 --> 00:28:50,635
She was transporting
collected evidence in her car.

00:28:50,635 --> 00:28:52,937
Now, we think because
of the sequence of events

00:28:52,937 --> 00:28:55,940
and the timing of everything
that she identified the suspect,

00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:58,510
who tracked her
to the highway location

00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:00,678
and confronted her.
Where's my mom?

00:29:00,678 --> 00:29:02,447
We pulled your rap sheet.

00:29:02,447 --> 00:29:04,315
You're a registered
sex offender.

00:29:04,315 --> 00:29:06,651
Yeah, for taking a
leak in an alleyway.

00:29:06,651 --> 00:29:08,253
You've been convicted
of burglary.

00:29:08,253 --> 00:29:10,255
What does this have
to do with anything?

00:29:10,255 --> 00:29:12,190
The rape victim, Amy Morse,
the one whose case

00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:13,758
your mom was working on,
you knew her.

00:29:13,758 --> 00:29:15,960
You went to Sagebrush
High with her.
Okay.

00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,329
There's 2,000 kids
at that school!

00:29:18,329 --> 00:29:21,833
I don't know her.
Your mom collected
a DNA sample from the rapist.

00:29:21,833 --> 00:29:25,670
She also collected
a DNA sample from you.

00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:28,973
Right now, the lab
is comparing them.

00:29:30,408 --> 00:29:33,511
Look, you got
to get my mom.

00:29:33,511 --> 00:29:34,946
Where is she, Tyler?

00:29:34,946 --> 00:29:36,681
Where's your mom?

00:29:36,681 --> 00:29:38,416
(knock at door)

00:29:39,784 --> 00:29:41,653
Captain.
Not now, Officer.

00:29:41,653 --> 00:29:43,822
A detective's come from Reno--
you've got to hear this.

00:29:43,822 --> 00:29:45,356
Take him out
in the hallway.

00:29:49,494 --> 00:29:50,495
How you doing?

00:29:50,495 --> 00:29:52,297
Jim Brass.

00:29:52,297 --> 00:29:55,233
Inspector Smith.
Reno PD.

00:29:55,233 --> 00:29:57,435
I hear that you've been
looking for CSI Dawn Banks.

00:29:57,435 --> 00:29:59,304
Yeah, that's right.

00:29:59,304 --> 00:30:01,473
She was supposed to be coming
up our way--never showed.

00:30:01,473 --> 00:30:03,908
What was she doing
with Reno PD?

00:30:03,908 --> 00:30:07,779
She was coming up to identify
her deceased son, Tyler.

00:30:07,779 --> 00:30:09,914
(exhales)

00:30:09,914 --> 00:30:13,918
That's her son
right there in the hallway.

00:30:13,918 --> 00:30:16,654
Okay, let's step back.

00:30:16,654 --> 00:30:18,423
Tell me what you know.

00:30:18,423 --> 00:30:20,592
Two nights ago, Reno officers
found a deceased male

00:30:20,592 --> 00:30:23,294
in a warehouse where homeless
kids were known to squat.

00:30:23,294 --> 00:30:25,830
Overdose.
Badly decomposed.

00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:29,534
Had a driver's license
identifying him as Tyler Banks.

00:30:29,534 --> 00:30:32,403
I called Ms. Banks
to break the news.

00:30:32,403 --> 00:30:34,739
<i>She was at a trailer park</i>
<i>working a case.</i>

00:30:34,739 --> 00:30:35,940
<i>She was devastated.</i>

00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:39,410
(sobbing):
Tyler...

00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:41,479
Oh...

00:30:41,479 --> 00:30:45,183
Said that she had always feared
a call like this about her son.

00:30:45,183 --> 00:30:46,684
She was gonna collect

00:30:46,684 --> 00:30:48,720
a DNA exemplar from home
and drive it up,

00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,624
confirm I.D.
She never showed.

00:30:52,624 --> 00:30:56,494
So that's why Dawn Banks was
taking a DNA sample of Tyler.

00:30:56,494 --> 00:30:58,830
He wasn't her suspect.

00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:00,632
She thought he was dead.

00:31:00,632 --> 00:31:02,333
RUSSELL:
<i>Henry ran Tyler's DNA</i>

00:31:02,333 --> 00:31:04,369
against the rapist.

00:31:04,369 --> 00:31:06,237
He's clear.
Apparently,
Tyler lent

00:31:06,237 --> 00:31:08,373
his I.D. to a buddy of his,
a homeless guy

00:31:08,373 --> 00:31:10,208
who was heading up to Reno.

00:31:10,208 --> 00:31:13,912
So his buddy O.D.'s,
decomposes beyond recognition,

00:31:13,912 --> 00:31:16,681
cops go off the I.D.
in his pocket.

00:31:16,681 --> 00:31:17,682
All right.

00:31:17,682 --> 00:31:18,917
So, let's run this.

00:31:18,917 --> 00:31:21,619
You get the call
that your son is dead,

00:31:21,619 --> 00:31:23,821
and you pick up
a piece of his laundry

00:31:23,821 --> 00:31:26,558
for DNA so you
can I.D. him.
You start driving

00:31:26,558 --> 00:31:29,360
up to Reno where the body is.
Right. Except...

00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,329
the road that her car

00:31:31,329 --> 00:31:33,731
ends up on is not
on the way to Reno.

00:31:33,731 --> 00:31:35,700
I found a receipt

00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,670
in Dawn's car from a truck stop,

00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:40,672
and the truck stop...

00:31:40,672 --> 00:31:42,340
is at the junction

00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:44,642
of 95 and 373.

00:31:44,642 --> 00:31:48,213
That's when she started
driving south, away from Reno.

00:31:48,213 --> 00:31:49,647
So maybe the truck stop

00:31:49,647 --> 00:31:51,683
is where she changed her mind,
and her route.

00:31:51,683 --> 00:31:54,619
The question is:
Where was she going?

00:31:56,921 --> 00:31:58,790
Tyler,

00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:01,192
I need to ask you a question.
Is there, um,

00:32:01,192 --> 00:32:03,261
any place off
of Highway 373 that

00:32:03,261 --> 00:32:04,762
may have meant
something to your mom?

00:32:04,762 --> 00:32:06,798
Why?

00:32:10,368 --> 00:32:12,237
Your mom thought
you were dead.

00:32:12,237 --> 00:32:15,607
Your I.D. was on a young
man who overdosed in Reno.

00:32:15,607 --> 00:32:17,575
She was driving out
to identify your body,

00:32:17,575 --> 00:32:20,211
and, for some reason,
she changed her mind.

00:32:20,211 --> 00:32:22,880
She stopped at a
truck stop, and, uh...

00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,482
We pulled
the surveillance footage.

00:32:24,482 --> 00:32:25,850
It looks like she bought...

00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:28,453
vodka and acetaminophen.

00:32:28,453 --> 00:32:30,188
S-So she's...
No, no, listen.

00:32:30,188 --> 00:32:32,190
W-We don't know that,
but we think that maybe,

00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:34,192
if she was going to do
something to herself,

00:32:34,192 --> 00:32:36,761
she might have chosen a place
that was significant.

00:32:38,896 --> 00:32:41,266
She used to take me
camping out there.

00:32:41,266 --> 00:32:42,867
But, I mean,
i-it was forever ago.

00:32:42,867 --> 00:32:44,769
Okay, show me.
Show me where.

00:32:50,174 --> 00:32:51,509
Good boy.

00:32:51,509 --> 00:32:53,845
This favorite spot
Tyler told you about,

00:32:53,845 --> 00:32:54,946
are you sure it's this way?

00:32:54,946 --> 00:32:56,848
That's what he said.

00:32:56,848 --> 00:32:59,183
But he and his mom haven't
been here in several years.

00:32:59,183 --> 00:33:01,185
He was a little hazy.
Well, if Dawn's up here,

00:33:01,185 --> 00:33:02,687
how many hours has it been?
(dog barking)

00:33:02,687 --> 00:33:05,523
Over there. Come on.

00:33:06,624 --> 00:33:08,693
(dog sniffing)

00:33:11,195 --> 00:33:12,430
(gasps)
Dawn.

00:33:16,901 --> 00:33:18,403
She's got a pulse.

00:33:18,403 --> 00:33:20,738
Control, this is
Adam-Zero-Four Yeager.

00:33:20,738 --> 00:33:22,407
We have CSI Banks. North trail,

00:33:22,407 --> 00:33:24,175
about a half-mile in.

00:33:24,175 --> 00:33:25,576
Send medics. Code three.

00:33:25,576 --> 00:33:28,513
Dawn? Come on.

00:33:28,513 --> 00:33:29,547
(sighs)
Dawn,

00:33:29,547 --> 00:33:30,648
wake up, please.

00:33:30,648 --> 00:33:31,916
Tyler is alive.

00:33:31,916 --> 00:33:33,818
He's okay. Come on.
Stay with us, Dawn.

00:33:33,818 --> 00:33:37,889
Dawn, help's on the way.

00:33:40,325 --> 00:33:42,627
Hey, boss. Got your text.
How's CSI Banks?

00:33:42,627 --> 00:33:45,263
Oh, she's in ICU.
Morgan's with her.

00:33:45,263 --> 00:33:46,798
Good. Uh, what's up?

00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:48,666
We still have
a serial rapist out there

00:33:48,666 --> 00:33:51,302
with some kind of connection
to that trailer park.

00:33:51,302 --> 00:33:52,537
Right.

00:33:52,537 --> 00:33:53,971
Want you to grab
Henry, go out there

00:33:53,971 --> 00:33:55,907
and go through all the
trash cans you can find.

00:33:55,907 --> 00:33:57,642
If you come up with
any biologicals,

00:33:57,642 --> 00:33:59,177
run them against
our rapist's DNA.

00:33:59,177 --> 00:34:00,745
We need to find
out if he's still

00:34:00,745 --> 00:34:01,946
in one of those
trailers.

00:34:01,946 --> 00:34:04,615
All right, I'm on it.
Thank you.

00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:20,665
Doing noble work here, ma'am.

00:34:21,766 --> 00:34:23,735
Hodges?

00:34:23,735 --> 00:34:25,803
Check this out.

00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,409
So they got

00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:35,313
top-of-the-line locks,
security cam. They're treating

00:34:35,313 --> 00:34:37,181
a dinged-up trailer
like it's Fort Knox.

00:34:37,181 --> 00:34:38,850
Paranoid,
or protecting something?

00:34:46,457 --> 00:34:48,593
Couple of wadded-up tissues.

00:34:48,593 --> 00:34:50,428
Ooh.

00:34:50,428 --> 00:34:52,930
I know what I'm
running first.

00:35:05,576 --> 00:35:08,346
DNA matches our rapist.

00:35:08,346 --> 00:35:10,281
We've got him.

00:35:12,483 --> 00:35:14,685
LVPD!

00:35:19,857 --> 00:35:21,325
All clear.

00:35:21,325 --> 00:35:23,261
Come on, Henry.

00:35:25,563 --> 00:35:27,832
(camera shutter clicks)

00:35:27,832 --> 00:35:29,834
Surveillance cam's
not hooked up.

00:35:29,834 --> 00:35:32,303
It's just for show.

00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:38,443
Young brunettes.

00:35:38,443 --> 00:35:40,445
Just like Amy
and the other victims.

00:35:40,445 --> 00:35:43,915
ANDREWS:
I got pics of Amy
with Jared Wallace, and, uh,

00:35:43,915 --> 00:35:46,451
other mementos.

00:35:49,387 --> 00:35:52,323
"Jared, I hope
what we have

00:35:52,323 --> 00:35:54,325
will last forever. Amy."

00:35:54,325 --> 00:35:56,727
Certainly lasted in his mind.

00:35:59,397 --> 00:36:01,632
Guy rents this trailer
to obsess

00:36:01,632 --> 00:36:04,602
and prepare
in private.

00:36:04,602 --> 00:36:06,337
Becomes his base

00:36:06,337 --> 00:36:09,240
when he starts to act out
on his obsession.

00:36:10,374 --> 00:36:12,376
Did some acting here, too.

00:36:12,376 --> 00:36:13,711
I'll swab.

00:36:25,256 --> 00:36:26,724
Heart medication.

00:36:26,724 --> 00:36:29,193
ANDREWS:
Swiped Daddy's prescription.

00:36:34,632 --> 00:36:36,667
A gray hair.

00:36:43,508 --> 00:36:45,810
It's not Jared.

00:36:48,913 --> 00:36:51,616
It's Dad.

00:36:51,616 --> 00:36:55,353
BRASS:
I guess I can
understand, Mr. Wallace.

00:36:55,353 --> 00:36:57,922
This whole event started
innocently at first.

00:36:57,922 --> 00:37:00,324
You know, son brings home
his girlfriend to meet Dad.

00:37:00,324 --> 00:37:01,425
She's attractive.

00:37:01,425 --> 00:37:03,528
Dad likes her.
He notices her.

00:37:03,528 --> 00:37:05,863
He liked having Amy
around, so he invites her

00:37:05,863 --> 00:37:08,566
to family picnics, outings,

00:37:08,566 --> 00:37:11,202
but then things
get weird.

00:37:11,202 --> 00:37:13,204
Dad gets kind of
jealous of son.

00:37:13,204 --> 00:37:14,939
Right? You also
took from him, too.

00:37:14,939 --> 00:37:17,174
You took his jacket,
his love letters.

00:37:17,174 --> 00:37:18,843
And you took from Amy, too.

00:37:20,711 --> 00:37:22,713
You know, we asked Amy
about you.

00:37:22,713 --> 00:37:25,449
What did she say?

00:37:25,449 --> 00:37:27,451
She said,

00:37:27,451 --> 00:37:31,422
"Ken Wallace walked in on me
once or twice in the shower,

00:37:31,422 --> 00:37:33,457
"but it was
innocent.

00:37:33,457 --> 00:37:36,394
"He was sweet,
clumsy, older man.

00:37:36,394 --> 00:37:38,963
Nothing sexual about him."

00:37:38,963 --> 00:37:42,633
So you had to
change that, so,

00:37:42,633 --> 00:37:44,635
when Amy broke up with Jared,
about a week later,

00:37:44,635 --> 00:37:46,737
you know, and you're gonna
lose her, too, you decided

00:37:46,737 --> 00:37:48,272
to do something
about it.

00:37:48,272 --> 00:37:50,408
Get a funky old
trailer, hired some

00:37:50,408 --> 00:37:51,876
brunette hookers.

00:37:51,876 --> 00:37:54,345
Got their DNA from the sheets.

00:37:54,345 --> 00:37:57,748
But you stepped
over the line.

00:37:57,748 --> 00:38:01,319
You started to prowl
around condos just like Amy's.

00:38:01,319 --> 00:38:04,622
Started to stalk young women,
brunettes, just like Amy.

00:38:04,622 --> 00:38:06,290
You broke into their house.

00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:07,892
You broke into
their bedroom

00:38:07,892 --> 00:38:11,228
to act out your
sick rape fantasies,

00:38:11,228 --> 00:38:14,565
all in preparation...

00:38:14,565 --> 00:38:16,500
for Amy.

00:38:18,569 --> 00:38:20,538
Amy was worth it.

00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:26,310
The woman... is a miracle.

00:38:28,212 --> 00:38:29,947
Jared had her, he messed it up.

00:38:32,383 --> 00:38:35,586
When I had my chance with her...

00:38:35,586 --> 00:38:38,389
I made it perfect.

00:38:44,528 --> 00:38:46,464
(indistinct voice over P.A.)

00:38:55,406 --> 00:38:59,343
Doctors say your mom's
gonna pull through.

00:38:59,343 --> 00:39:02,780
I never wanted to hurt her.

00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:04,782
I know.

00:39:04,782 --> 00:39:06,717
Or make it easy
for her to believe

00:39:06,717 --> 00:39:07,885
I'd end up dead that way.

00:39:18,663 --> 00:39:20,431
You know, I-I just keep thinking

00:39:20,431 --> 00:39:23,434
about how cold
she was out there.

00:39:23,434 --> 00:39:25,703
You know,
I could've told her,

00:39:25,703 --> 00:39:28,839
sleeping outside sucks.

00:39:33,477 --> 00:39:36,580
She's going to need you,
Tyler, more than ever.

00:39:40,184 --> 00:39:42,186
I swear to God,

00:39:42,186 --> 00:39:45,756
I'm not leaving the house
for a second.

00:39:45,756 --> 00:39:47,858
I'm done...

00:39:47,858 --> 00:39:50,661
with everything,
everyone else.

00:39:50,661 --> 00:39:53,964
Just let her be okay.

00:39:53,964 --> 00:39:56,200
(crying)

00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:59,870
Please let her be okay.

00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:01,872
(crying)
