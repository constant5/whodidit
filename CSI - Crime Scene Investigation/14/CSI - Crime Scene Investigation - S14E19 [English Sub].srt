00:00:06,082 --> 00:00:08,017
(indistinct conversations)

00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:17,627
Lieutenant Hughes?

00:00:17,627 --> 00:00:19,629
You got a suspect
for me, I believe.

00:00:19,629 --> 00:00:21,097
We are bringing him in now.

00:00:21,097 --> 00:00:23,032
Felony auto theft, right?

00:00:23,032 --> 00:00:25,468
Your lab sent
this file over.

00:00:25,468 --> 00:00:28,571
Some kid totaled
Councilman Hawk's new BMW?

00:00:28,571 --> 00:00:30,006
<i>You</i> got a political one.

00:00:30,006 --> 00:00:32,909
Jacob Baker.

00:00:32,909 --> 00:00:34,611
Jacob Baker?

00:00:34,611 --> 00:00:36,446
Isn't he the guy that
CSI Stokes brought in for

00:00:36,446 --> 00:00:38,047
pointing lasers
at airplanes?

00:00:38,047 --> 00:00:40,883
I thought Nick had scared him
straight, but I guess not.

00:00:40,883 --> 00:00:43,686
All right, tell the councilman
he can rest easy.

00:00:43,686 --> 00:00:45,622
We will get <i>justice</i>
for his Beemer.

00:00:45,622 --> 00:00:47,457
HUGHES:
Thanks for bringing
him in, Blake.

00:00:47,457 --> 00:00:49,525
No problem.
Headed back out on patrol.

00:00:49,525 --> 00:00:50,593
Change of plans.

00:00:50,593 --> 00:00:52,028
I cleared it
with your sergeant.

00:00:52,028 --> 00:00:54,597
I need you to cover Dolan
at the reception desk.

00:00:54,597 --> 00:00:56,032
Okay...

00:00:56,032 --> 00:00:57,767
You know how I <i>love</i>
taking orders from you.

00:00:57,767 --> 00:00:59,135
Am I going to have to report you

00:00:59,135 --> 00:01:01,571
for insubordination,
Officer Hughes?

00:01:01,571 --> 00:01:04,807
Go ahead. I'll claim sexual
harassment, Lieutenant Hughes.

00:01:04,807 --> 00:01:06,843
RUSSELL:
Guys, get a room.

00:01:06,843 --> 00:01:09,145
Oh, that's right, you don't have
to, you're already married.

00:01:09,145 --> 00:01:10,146
(chuckles)

00:01:10,146 --> 00:01:11,447
So, tell me about the kid.

00:01:11,447 --> 00:01:12,615
Give you any trouble?

00:01:12,615 --> 00:01:13,716
No. Seemed like a mama's boy.

00:01:13,716 --> 00:01:15,084
You should talk.

00:01:15,084 --> 00:01:16,619
See what I have to
put up with?
Ooh.

00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:25,461
Sir, I am connecting you to
Detective Crawford right now.

00:01:25,461 --> 00:01:27,497
Cavalry's arrived.

00:01:27,497 --> 00:01:29,499
What did you do to your wife
to deserve this?

00:01:29,499 --> 00:01:31,100
Just taking one for the team.

00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,635
Well, it's all yours.

00:01:32,635 --> 00:01:34,103
I need you to
fill out your name

00:01:34,103 --> 00:01:35,138
in the top box there,

00:01:35,138 --> 00:01:37,774
and then
your home address

00:01:37,774 --> 00:01:40,209
goes in the box
right below that.

00:01:40,209 --> 00:01:42,545
Okay, who's next?

00:01:42,545 --> 00:01:44,213
Please step up
to the counter.

00:01:44,213 --> 00:01:46,683
Hey, kid, what do you
think you're doing?!

00:01:46,683 --> 00:01:48,484
Son, you got to wait
your turn.

00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,655
Hey! Did you <i>hear</i> me?

00:01:57,694 --> 00:01:58,795
(people exclaiming)

00:01:58,795 --> 00:02:00,596
Just relax, all right?

00:02:00,596 --> 00:02:02,198
Just take it easy.

00:02:02,198 --> 00:02:04,133
(gunshot echoes,
casing clatters to floor)

00:02:04,133 --> 00:02:06,969
(distant screaming,
Blake sighs)

00:02:06,969 --> 00:02:08,705
(sputters)

00:02:08,705 --> 00:02:10,106
MAN:
Go, go!

00:02:10,106 --> 00:02:12,208
(woman whimpers)

00:02:14,944 --> 00:02:17,080
(whimpers)

00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,614
(gunshot, casing clatters)

00:02:18,614 --> 00:02:20,183
(panicked shouting)

00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:25,688
(woman sobbing)

00:02:25,688 --> 00:02:27,623
(casing clattering)

00:02:31,661 --> 00:02:33,563
(officer grunts,
distant screaming)

00:02:35,565 --> 00:02:38,701
(gunshot, casing clattering)

00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:42,672
(panicked shouts)

00:02:48,511 --> 00:02:50,613
MAN:
He's got another gun!

00:02:55,017 --> 00:02:56,452
(woman sobs)

00:03:08,598 --> 00:03:11,000
(woman sobs)

00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:15,071
(rapid gunshots)

00:03:15,071 --> 00:03:17,106
MAN:
Hold your fire!
Russell's in there!

00:03:17,106 --> 00:03:18,574
(panting)
Okay.

00:03:18,574 --> 00:03:19,609
Okay, easy.

00:03:19,609 --> 00:03:20,676
(groans)
Just take it easy.

00:03:22,078 --> 00:03:24,013

PAULA FRANCIS (on TV):
...Desert Palm Hospital.

00:04:03,085 --> 00:04:05,415
Our understanding is
the <i>shooter</i> has now

00:04:05,415 --> 00:04:06,983
barricaded <i>himself</i>

00:04:06,983 --> 00:04:08,451
inside an interrogation room

00:04:08,451 --> 00:04:10,253
and is holding hostages.

00:04:10,253 --> 00:04:12,355
No word yet on whether or not
What the hell's going on?

00:04:12,355 --> 00:04:13,523
there are any casualties.

00:04:13,523 --> 00:04:15,192
It looks really bad.

00:04:15,192 --> 00:04:16,893
Guys, I just got off
the phone with Brass.

00:04:16,893 --> 00:04:17,994
Russell is in the room

00:04:17,994 --> 00:04:19,429
with the shooter.
What?!

00:04:19,429 --> 00:04:21,331
They haven't been able
to make contact with him.

00:04:21,331 --> 00:04:23,200
They're still
securing the building.
Okay.

00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,467
Well, the best
thing we can do

00:04:24,467 --> 00:04:26,203
for everyone right
now, is our jobs.

00:04:26,203 --> 00:04:28,238
So, Greg, you want to head over
to PD with me right now,

00:04:28,238 --> 00:04:29,806
see what's going on?
Yeah. Sure.

00:04:29,806 --> 00:04:31,374
I'll go to the hospital,
collect evidence.

00:04:31,374 --> 00:04:33,810
I'll run things
from here.

00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:36,846
(man shouts orders)

00:04:36,846 --> 00:04:40,016
...the generators
are good to go.

00:04:40,016 --> 00:04:42,886
All men in position!
Weapons high!

00:04:42,886 --> 00:04:46,022
(gun clicking)

00:04:46,022 --> 00:04:47,824
BRASS: Mr. Mayor,
all I can tell you now,

00:04:47,824 --> 00:04:50,527
is I have one officer dead
and four others wounded.

00:04:50,527 --> 00:04:51,528
It <i>seems</i> like the shooter

00:04:51,528 --> 00:04:52,996
was targeting police officers.

00:04:52,996 --> 00:04:54,331
We're clearing the building now.

00:04:54,331 --> 00:04:55,832
I'll call you back
when I know more.

00:04:55,832 --> 00:04:57,434
Sir, you wanted to see me?

00:04:59,035 --> 00:05:01,471
Lieutenant Hughes,
I saw the wounded list.

00:05:01,471 --> 00:05:03,306
Your husband's on it.

00:05:03,306 --> 00:05:04,941
(whispering):
Oh, my God.

00:05:04,941 --> 00:05:06,843
He was at the front desk
when the shooter came in.

00:05:06,843 --> 00:05:08,345
I know.

00:05:08,345 --> 00:05:10,580
(trembling):
<i>I'm</i> the one who put him there.

00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,349
How bad is he?

00:05:12,349 --> 00:05:15,051
You should go to the hospital.

00:05:15,051 --> 00:05:16,052
But...

00:05:16,052 --> 00:05:17,053
No. Go. Go. Debbie, go.

00:05:17,053 --> 00:05:19,189
Go. We got this covered. Go.

00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:21,091
Where's that camera feed
from interrogation?!

00:05:21,091 --> 00:05:22,959
It goes directly into
the observation room.

00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:24,427
I'm trying to reroute it.

00:05:24,427 --> 00:05:26,963
I need eyes on that room!
Yes, sir.

00:05:26,963 --> 00:05:28,031
(phone ringing)

00:05:28,031 --> 00:05:29,266
(Jacob yells)

00:05:29,266 --> 00:05:31,401
Hey! Hey! Hey, you!
Back against the wall!

00:05:31,401 --> 00:05:33,136
All right. All right. All right.

00:05:33,136 --> 00:05:35,005
JACOB: What the hell, man?!
Why'd you shoot me?!

00:05:35,005 --> 00:05:36,873
TEEN: I didn't shoot you,
I don't even know you.

00:05:36,873 --> 00:05:37,874
Everyone just shut up!

00:05:37,874 --> 00:05:39,042
(groans)

00:05:39,042 --> 00:05:40,577
What happened,
did you get hit?

00:05:40,577 --> 00:05:42,345
Man!
Cops are firing rounds

00:05:42,345 --> 00:05:44,547
in this room, you probably
caught one the same time he did.

00:05:44,547 --> 00:05:45,915
Probably cracked a rib.

00:05:45,915 --> 00:05:47,417
(groans)

00:05:47,417 --> 00:05:49,119
(phone continues ringing)

00:05:49,119 --> 00:05:50,920
You're gonna have
to let me answer this.

00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,389
I told you, no.

00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:53,990
Let me, let me tell you
how this works.

00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:55,358
If I don't answer this
pretty soon...

00:05:55,358 --> 00:05:56,593
(phone continues ringing)

00:05:56,593 --> 00:05:58,261
...cops are gonna think
I'm dead.

00:05:58,261 --> 00:05:59,963
And they're gonna think
that he's dead.

00:05:59,963 --> 00:06:01,931
And then it's not gonna just
be a couple of rounds.

00:06:01,931 --> 00:06:03,900
They're gonna
light this place up.

00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,268
Well, maybe that's what I want.

00:06:07,037 --> 00:06:09,339
You think I didn't know
I was gonna die today?

00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,441
(computer trilling)

00:06:11,441 --> 00:06:13,943
Hey, did you talk to Russell?

00:06:13,943 --> 00:06:15,378
No. He-He's not picking up.

00:06:15,378 --> 00:06:17,447
Yeah. Well, radio silence
usually means one thing:

00:06:17,447 --> 00:06:18,448
Guy's not giving up.

00:06:18,448 --> 00:06:19,983
If your CSI's still alive,

00:06:19,983 --> 00:06:23,420
best chance to save him...
tactical entry.

00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:26,456
That is a negative.
We're not there yet, Dolan.

00:06:26,456 --> 00:06:28,091
And when we are, it's
gonna be too late.

00:06:28,091 --> 00:06:30,193
Yeah, and if we go in too early,
everybody gets killed,

00:06:30,193 --> 00:06:31,294
so why don't you just...

00:06:31,294 --> 00:06:33,430
be cool right now,
all right?

00:06:35,365 --> 00:06:37,000
God, it's friggin' cold
in here, man.

00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,402
He needs a doctor.
He's all right.

00:06:39,402 --> 00:06:41,438
(struggling):
Oh, yeah... g-g-great.

00:06:41,438 --> 00:06:43,006
I'm gonna take a look at him.

00:06:43,006 --> 00:06:44,574
Hey! You don't move!
Hey.

00:06:44,574 --> 00:06:46,476
Listen, you know, I don't
know what your deal is.

00:06:46,476 --> 00:06:48,311
I don't know why you thought
you had to do this,

00:06:48,311 --> 00:06:50,547
but it has nothing to
do with Jacob here.

00:06:50,547 --> 00:06:52,182
You got the gun.

00:06:52,182 --> 00:06:54,084
You're in charge.
Besides, you know something,

00:06:54,084 --> 00:06:55,952
I don't, I don't think
you want to see him suffer

00:06:55,952 --> 00:06:57,554
any more than he has.

00:06:57,554 --> 00:06:58,555
Do you?

00:07:01,257 --> 00:07:02,859
All right. Mm.

00:07:02,859 --> 00:07:04,894
(panting)

00:07:04,894 --> 00:07:06,830
Jacob, you're not
gonna like this.

00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:07,997
(groans)

00:07:07,997 --> 00:07:09,232
Ready? Here we go.
(screaming)

00:07:09,232 --> 00:07:11,234
Okay. All right. All right.
(groaning)

00:07:11,234 --> 00:07:13,837
That's good, buddy.
There you go.
Was that really necessary?

00:07:13,837 --> 00:07:15,305
Lean forward here.
I'm going to...

00:07:15,305 --> 00:07:17,374
(short rapid whimpering)
Come on. Okay.

00:07:17,374 --> 00:07:18,975
(groaning)
Well, you know what?

00:07:18,975 --> 00:07:20,510
You are a very...

00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:22,278
very lucky boy.

00:07:22,278 --> 00:07:24,514
How is getting shot
being "lucky"?

00:07:24,514 --> 00:07:26,983
Well, uh, because... (grunts)
(groans)

00:07:26,983 --> 00:07:28,985
the bullet went
straight through,

00:07:28,985 --> 00:07:31,821
so all we have to do is
stop the bleeding here.

00:07:31,821 --> 00:07:33,390
(Jacob groans)

00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:34,524
Here we go.
(groans)

00:07:34,524 --> 00:07:35,592
All right. All right.

00:07:35,592 --> 00:07:37,093
(Jacob groans)
Give me your hand.

00:07:37,093 --> 00:07:38,595
Give me your hand.
(groaning, whimpering)

00:07:38,595 --> 00:07:40,130
You're doing great.
JACOB: Oh...!

00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:41,464
What's your name, son?

00:07:41,464 --> 00:07:43,366
What do you care?

00:07:43,366 --> 00:07:46,469
(sighs) It makes for an easier
conversation, that's all.

00:07:47,871 --> 00:07:49,406
You first.

00:07:49,406 --> 00:07:50,573
My name's Russell.

00:07:50,573 --> 00:07:51,875
D.B. Russell.

00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:54,010
Your turn.

00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:55,445
No uniform.

00:07:55,445 --> 00:07:56,880
No suit.

00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,114
No gun.

00:07:58,114 --> 00:07:59,883
You're not a cop.

00:07:59,883 --> 00:08:01,851
No. I'm a CSI.

00:08:01,851 --> 00:08:03,420
Is that why
you didn't shoot me?

00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,555
You got a beef just with cops?

00:08:05,555 --> 00:08:06,523
(panting)

00:08:08,892 --> 00:08:11,294
(laughs)
C-CSI, huh?

00:08:11,294 --> 00:08:13,062
Mm-hmm.
Like a science guy?

00:08:13,062 --> 00:08:15,298
Yeah.
Makes sense.

00:08:15,298 --> 00:08:16,933
Looks like you know
what you're doing.

00:08:16,933 --> 00:08:18,468
If you mean,
I know first aid,

00:08:18,468 --> 00:08:22,005
yeah, but that doesn't take away
from the fact that

00:08:22,005 --> 00:08:23,940
he needs a doctor.

00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,809
BRASS: <i>How are we doing on</i>
<i>that camera feed?</i>

00:08:25,809 --> 00:08:27,310
I think I'm only going to
be able to get your picture.

00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,378
No sound.

00:08:28,378 --> 00:08:29,546
I'll take anything you can get.

00:08:29,546 --> 00:08:32,348
(phone ringing)

00:08:34,517 --> 00:08:36,252

D.B.?

00:08:36,252 --> 00:08:37,287
RUSSELL:
Yeah, Jim...

00:08:37,287 --> 00:08:39,355
OFFICER:
Captain, I got it.

00:08:39,355 --> 00:08:41,157
RUSSELL: We got you on
speakerphone here,

00:08:41,157 --> 00:08:42,992
just so you know.

00:08:42,992 --> 00:08:44,360
BRASS:
What's your status?

00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,929
Uh, I think
we're okay...

00:08:45,929 --> 00:08:46,930
for the moment.

00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:48,832
I do have a young man...

00:08:48,832 --> 00:08:52,101
Jacob here, who needs
medical attention.

00:08:52,101 --> 00:08:53,269
But our, um,

00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:54,404
our friend with
the gun here,

00:08:54,404 --> 00:08:55,438
is not comfortable

00:08:55,438 --> 00:08:57,040
bringing a doctor in.

00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,108
BRASS: We can get you
anything you need.

00:08:59,108 --> 00:09:01,344
Food, water... medical supplies.

00:09:01,344 --> 00:09:02,879
All right.

00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:04,881
Okay, I think
we've agreed on that.

00:09:04,881 --> 00:09:07,417
So, I guess the young man with
the gun is listening on speaker?

00:09:07,417 --> 00:09:10,053
Yeah. I'm here.
What do you want?

00:09:10,053 --> 00:09:12,388
BRASS: Well, I was gonna ask you
the same thing.

00:09:12,388 --> 00:09:13,957
What do I want?

00:09:13,957 --> 00:09:16,292
BRASS:
Yeah. What do you want?

00:09:16,292 --> 00:09:17,227
Nothing.

00:09:19,229 --> 00:09:21,464
BRASS:
What's your name, son?

00:09:21,464 --> 00:09:24,934
Yeah. We-we already
tried that, Jim.

00:09:24,934 --> 00:09:26,135
(sighs)

00:09:26,135 --> 00:09:27,403
What do you want?

00:09:28,938 --> 00:09:30,340
Maybe one thing...

00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,341
a laptop.

00:09:37,413 --> 00:09:39,082
Any luck recovering
any of the bullets?

00:09:39,082 --> 00:09:41,818
I'm working on it.

00:09:41,818 --> 00:09:43,386
Any word yet on Russell?
He's okay.

00:09:43,386 --> 00:09:44,988
He was able to contact Brass

00:09:44,988 --> 00:09:46,890
and now they have a
direct line of communication

00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,324
with the gunman.

00:09:48,324 --> 00:09:50,560
I found a photo
in Officer Matsuda's wallet.

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,962
Four kids, all boys.

00:09:52,962 --> 00:09:54,330
Has the family
been notified yet?

00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,565
No. I guess they
want to keep a lid

00:09:55,565 --> 00:09:56,966
on what goes out
to the public,

00:09:56,966 --> 00:09:58,268
in case the gunman is watching.

00:09:58,268 --> 00:10:00,003
Meanwhile, his poor family
has no idea

00:10:00,003 --> 00:10:01,271
that he's not
coming home tonight.

00:10:02,539 --> 00:10:04,507
Looks like a nine millimeter.

00:10:04,507 --> 00:10:05,942
Consistent...

00:10:05,942 --> 00:10:07,844
with the weapon
we found on the scene.

00:10:07,844 --> 00:10:09,045
(metal clinks)
Hopefully,

00:10:09,045 --> 00:10:10,513
with this bullet
and that weapon,

00:10:10,513 --> 00:10:12,448
we'll be able to I.D.
the shooter.

Wh-Where's Blake?

00:10:54,991 --> 00:10:56,526
They took him upstairs--
he's in surgery.

00:10:56,526 --> 00:10:58,895
So-so he's not...?
No. No. No.

00:10:58,895 --> 00:11:00,396
They're working on him
right now, uh...

00:11:00,396 --> 00:11:02,432
I'm sure the doctors
will have some news soon.

00:11:02,432 --> 00:11:03,499
Why did this happen?

00:11:03,499 --> 00:11:05,068
Why now?

00:11:05,068 --> 00:11:06,603
I-I was just starting
to think that things

00:11:06,603 --> 00:11:08,204
were gonna be good again.

00:11:08,204 --> 00:11:10,106

Both you being on the job...

00:11:12,141 --> 00:11:13,810
I know that's not easy.

00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:15,411
But that was behind us.

00:11:15,411 --> 00:11:17,981
We were ourselves again,
making plans for the future.

00:11:17,981 --> 00:11:19,415
And now...

00:11:19,415 --> 00:11:21,117
Debbie, you can't believe that.
Not right now.

00:11:21,117 --> 00:11:22,485
Okay, Blake is gonna
pull through this.

00:11:22,485 --> 00:11:23,820
He's gonna come through this.

00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,355
You have to believe that.

00:11:25,355 --> 00:11:26,456
Okay?

00:11:32,061 --> 00:11:33,997
(groaning, panting)

00:11:36,299 --> 00:11:37,600
The pain's getting worse.

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,003
RUSSELL:
Meds will be here
in a second.

00:11:40,003 --> 00:11:41,404
You know,
you just need one of us.

00:11:42,905 --> 00:11:45,008
True... but

00:11:45,008 --> 00:11:46,909
isn't he more valuable than you?

00:11:46,909 --> 00:11:48,378
Being a civilian and all?

00:11:50,446 --> 00:11:52,982

Okay... All right, well,

00:11:52,982 --> 00:11:54,417
we've cleared the building.

00:11:54,417 --> 00:11:56,586

out of there.

00:11:58,087 --> 00:11:59,389
Yeah, <i>alive.</i>

00:11:59,389 --> 00:12:00,523
Yeah, <i>alive.</i>

00:12:00,523 --> 00:12:01,991
Sir,

00:12:01,991 --> 00:12:03,359
you wanted sound,
I got it for you.

00:12:03,359 --> 00:12:05,228
I put a mic inside this
epinephrine injector.

00:12:05,228 --> 00:12:06,496
I figure we could
get it to Russell

00:12:06,496 --> 00:12:08,231
with the rest
of the medical supplies.

00:12:08,231 --> 00:12:09,966
Nice work, Dunn.

00:12:09,966 --> 00:12:11,934
Now, we need to figure out
a way to let Russell know

00:12:11,934 --> 00:12:14,437
that there's a microphone
implanted in this device.

00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:17,407
I can take care of that.

Put your hands to the sides

00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,514
Slowly!

00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:10,093
I'm not armed.

00:13:10,093 --> 00:13:11,594
Just the delivery guy.

00:13:11,594 --> 00:13:12,895
What's your plan now?

00:13:14,997 --> 00:13:16,399
You can take the delivery.

00:13:20,403 --> 00:13:21,437

How bad is it?

00:13:41,023 --> 00:13:42,358
It's pretty bad.

Food, water... meds.

Oh, uh,

00:13:49,832 --> 00:13:51,467

from your desk.

00:13:55,838 --> 00:13:57,974

Hey. You texted me.
You got something?

00:14:23,599 --> 00:14:25,968
So, the bullets
that we recovered from

00:14:25,968 --> 00:14:28,805
Officer Matsuda didn't
provide us anything, but

00:14:28,805 --> 00:14:30,106
the shooter dropped a gun

00:14:30,106 --> 00:14:31,440
and that's another story.

00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,442
Gun's been through
a lot of hands.

00:14:33,442 --> 00:14:35,978
First, seller and then
seven other sales after that.

00:14:35,978 --> 00:14:37,446
Ending up in Arizona.

00:14:37,446 --> 00:14:39,448
Purchased last year
by Mr. Holland Walker.

00:14:39,448 --> 00:14:41,417
Age 48.

00:14:41,417 --> 00:14:43,052
Scottsdale address.

00:14:43,052 --> 00:14:45,488
How does Mr. Walker's gun,
in Arizona,

00:14:45,488 --> 00:14:46,956
end up in the hands of a kid

00:14:46,956 --> 00:14:48,491
shooting up LVPD?

00:14:48,491 --> 00:14:50,059
Call Walker.
See if he has an answer.

How you doing here, Jacob?

00:15:06,876 --> 00:15:08,344
Feeling good, sir.

00:15:08,344 --> 00:15:09,812
Actually, I'm not...

00:15:09,812 --> 00:15:11,280
I'm not feeling much
of anything.

00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,582
Well, that's 'cause
you're on some

00:15:12,582 --> 00:15:14,350
pretty good
drugs there, buddy.

00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:16,886
I'm just gonna
clean you up here

00:15:16,886 --> 00:15:18,287
and you'll be good to go.

00:15:18,287 --> 00:15:21,557

Hey. Do me a favor, will you?

00:15:24,393 --> 00:15:26,329
Give me a hand here.

00:15:26,329 --> 00:15:28,431
I'm-I'm not asking you
to put the gun down.

00:15:28,431 --> 00:15:30,099
I just need,
I just need a hand.

00:15:30,099 --> 00:15:31,534
Give me some water.

00:15:31,534 --> 00:15:32,602
Please.

00:15:32,602 --> 00:15:34,303
Oh, come on, will you?

00:15:34,303 --> 00:15:36,806
You afraid to get your
hands bloody, or something?

00:15:36,806 --> 00:15:40,243
Hand me the water.

00:15:40,243 --> 00:15:41,444
Come on.

00:15:41,444 --> 00:15:43,045
All right.

00:15:44,146 --> 00:15:45,381
That was a close one.

00:15:45,381 --> 00:15:47,316
Russell knows what he's doing.

00:15:50,353 --> 00:15:53,189
What is that medal?
Is that Saint Christopher?

00:15:53,189 --> 00:15:55,091
Yeah. So?

00:15:55,091 --> 00:15:58,461
Well, it just looked like it was
important to you, that's all.

00:15:58,461 --> 00:15:59,929
I used to have
one of those.

00:15:59,929 --> 00:16:01,530
Good for you.

00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:03,065
Easy. Easy. Easy.

00:16:03,065 --> 00:16:04,367
(groans, panting)

00:16:04,367 --> 00:16:05,501
My wife gave it to me.

00:16:05,501 --> 00:16:07,370
She wanted to protect me
at work.

00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:08,371
(chuckles)

00:16:08,371 --> 00:16:10,206
Who gave you yours?

00:16:10,206 --> 00:16:12,375
I told you this whole, "Let's
have a conversation" thing

00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,110
isn't going to work.

00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:16,445
It's gonna make for a
hell of a long evening.

00:16:16,445 --> 00:16:18,080
Maybe.

00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,982
Maybe not.

00:16:19,982 --> 00:16:22,184
JACOB:
Come on, dude.

00:16:22,184 --> 00:16:24,153
Don't be such a tool.

00:16:24,153 --> 00:16:25,554
I'm ju... I'm just saying.

00:16:25,554 --> 00:16:27,823
If this was supposed to be
a suicide mission,

00:16:27,823 --> 00:16:29,859
then why aren't you dead?

00:16:29,859 --> 00:16:32,828
You know something?

00:16:32,828 --> 00:16:34,563
I think you're wondering
the same thing.

00:16:34,563 --> 00:16:36,332
I think there's
someone out there

00:16:36,332 --> 00:16:38,034
you don't want to hurt.

00:16:38,034 --> 00:16:39,835
You know, someone who's
worried about you.

00:16:39,835 --> 00:16:42,004
Maybe the same person
who gave you that medal.

00:16:42,004 --> 00:16:43,339
I'm thinking you should shut up.

00:16:45,007 --> 00:16:47,410
Oh, hell. Uh...

00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:49,045
Hold onto this,
just for a second.

00:16:49,045 --> 00:16:50,446
Easy, easy.

00:16:50,446 --> 00:16:52,415
You all right?

00:16:53,582 --> 00:16:55,084
Thank you.

00:17:14,036 --> 00:17:16,339
DUNN:
Why's he looking
at us like that?

00:17:20,276 --> 00:17:21,978
The water bottle.

00:17:21,978 --> 00:17:22,979
What about it?

00:17:22,979 --> 00:17:24,013
Get me a screen grab.

00:17:24,013 --> 00:17:25,448
Isolate that bottle.

00:17:25,448 --> 00:17:27,350
Yes, sir.

00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:28,985
(computer whirring, beeping)

00:17:30,453 --> 00:17:32,154
STOKES:
Son of a bitch,

00:17:32,154 --> 00:17:33,589
he just got us
the guy's prints.

00:17:33,589 --> 00:17:35,424
I told you he knew
what he was doing.

00:17:38,461 --> 00:17:40,463
FINLAY:
Are they good enough to run?

00:17:40,463 --> 00:17:43,065
In the right hands... yes.

00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,901
This should do it.

00:17:45,901 --> 00:17:47,570
We'll see what we got.

00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:50,439
(computer whirring)

00:17:50,439 --> 00:17:52,475
FINLAY:
Mark Powell. 16 years old.

00:17:52,475 --> 00:17:54,477
16-year-old walks into PD

00:17:54,477 --> 00:17:55,945
and starts killing cops.

00:17:55,945 --> 00:17:57,546
How does that happen?

00:17:57,546 --> 00:17:59,215
Well, his juvie
record's sealed.

00:17:59,215 --> 00:18:00,916
Maybe there'll be some
answers in there.

00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:02,385
Well, maybe there's
some answers here.

00:18:02,385 --> 00:18:03,386
(computer beeps)

00:18:03,386 --> 00:18:04,487
Got a home address.

00:18:06,956 --> 00:18:09,525
STOKES:
That's the kid's mom
right there, Cynthia Powell.

00:18:09,525 --> 00:18:10,960
Does she have any idea
why her son

00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,361
might do something
like this?
No.

00:18:12,361 --> 00:18:15,531
She talked to Brass.
She's still in shock.

00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,601
Said she doesn't even
own a gun.

00:18:18,601 --> 00:18:21,470
Has no clue how her son
would be able to get his hands

00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:23,005
on an arsenal like this.

00:18:23,005 --> 00:18:25,007
Who's processing their house?
Morgan.

00:18:25,007 --> 00:18:27,109
And she also told Brass
that the kid used

00:18:27,109 --> 00:18:28,544
the family van.

00:18:28,544 --> 00:18:30,346
Patrol found it a
couple of blocks from here.

00:18:30,346 --> 00:18:31,847
Impound's bringing it in
right now

00:18:31,847 --> 00:18:32,948
if you want to
get on that.

00:18:32,948 --> 00:18:34,083
Yeah. I will.

00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:35,317
STOKES:
All right, good luck.

00:18:40,122 --> 00:18:41,957
I'm so sorry.

00:18:41,957 --> 00:18:42,925
So are we.

00:18:50,933 --> 00:18:52,101
(sighs)

00:18:55,104 --> 00:18:57,239
Okay, Mrs. Powell, come on,
I want you to have a seat...

00:18:57,239 --> 00:18:59,308
(trembling):
Oh, my God! Mark.

00:19:00,976 --> 00:19:04,280
BRASS:
Mrs. Powell,
come have a seat please.

00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,414
Okay.

00:19:05,414 --> 00:19:07,383
(crying)

00:19:07,383 --> 00:19:09,151
I'm gonna ask you
to phone Mark.

00:19:09,151 --> 00:19:10,519
Now, I know this
is tough, I do,

00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:13,222
but I need you to try
to reach out to him.

00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,358
I don't know what to say to him.

00:19:18,561 --> 00:19:20,863
Just remind him
that he's your son,

00:19:20,863 --> 00:19:23,265
you know, tell him
that you love him.

00:19:23,265 --> 00:19:24,300
And that he has a future

00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,569
if he will just...

00:19:26,569 --> 00:19:28,804
let these people go

00:19:28,804 --> 00:19:30,473
and come home with you.

00:19:30,473 --> 00:19:31,941
(whispering):
Okay.

00:19:31,941 --> 00:19:33,442
Can you do that?

00:19:33,442 --> 00:19:35,544
(voice breaking):
I'll try.

00:19:35,544 --> 00:19:37,012
(phone ringing)

00:19:39,582 --> 00:19:41,450
(sighs)

00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:43,119
Yeah... yeah,
go ahead, answer it.

00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:44,920
Yeah, Jim.

00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,422
BRASS:
Well, I assume
that the young man

00:19:46,422 --> 00:19:47,590
is listening over the speaker?

00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:49,158
Yes, he is.

00:19:49,158 --> 00:19:52,228
I have someone
who wants to speak with him.

00:19:52,228 --> 00:19:53,395
(crying):
Mark, sweetheart,

00:19:53,395 --> 00:19:55,030
it's me.

00:19:56,332 --> 00:19:57,533
M-M-M-Mom?

00:19:57,533 --> 00:19:58,934
W-W-What are you doing here?!

00:19:58,934 --> 00:20:00,836
The police found me.

00:20:00,836 --> 00:20:03,239
What? How?!

00:20:03,239 --> 00:20:05,074
It doesn't matter, sweetheart.

00:20:07,376 --> 00:20:08,377
You need to let

00:20:08,377 --> 00:20:09,578
those people go.

00:20:09,578 --> 00:20:10,980
You've got to stop this.

00:20:12,515 --> 00:20:15,151
Mark.

00:20:15,151 --> 00:20:17,253
You son of a bitch.

00:20:17,253 --> 00:20:19,522
You played me.
You think I'm an idiot...
No. I don't, Mark.

00:20:19,522 --> 00:20:21,290
I just think you need help,
that's all.

00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:22,825
"Mark"?!

00:20:22,825 --> 00:20:24,593
All right.
You-you got my name,

00:20:24,593 --> 00:20:25,895
you found my mother,

00:20:25,895 --> 00:20:28,130
but you don't know who I am!

00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:29,165
But the world's gonna know,

00:20:29,165 --> 00:20:31,133
'cause you know why?!

00:20:31,133 --> 00:20:33,035
'Cause it's over.

00:20:39,341 --> 00:20:40,509
(gunshot)

00:20:40,509 --> 00:20:42,278
OFFICER: Shots fired.
Mark!

00:20:42,278 --> 00:20:43,913
I need you to leave.
It's for your own safety.
No!

00:20:43,913 --> 00:20:45,447
Promise me
you won't hurt my son.

00:20:45,447 --> 00:20:47,383
Officer Wincroft, escort
Mrs. Powell to an outer office.

00:20:47,383 --> 00:20:48,884
What the hell's going on?
I heard a shot.

00:20:48,884 --> 00:20:49,952
DUNN:
Still got ears in there,
Captain.

00:20:49,952 --> 00:20:51,153
What's going on in there?!

00:20:51,153 --> 00:20:52,988
RUSSELL:
Mark...
Hey, come on.

00:20:52,988 --> 00:20:55,090
Don't do anything
that we're all gonna regret.

00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:56,492
I think we're way past that!

00:20:56,492 --> 00:20:58,294
Actually, no, we're not,
but we will be.

00:20:58,294 --> 00:20:59,995
In about five seconds,

00:20:59,995 --> 00:21:01,430
they're gonna come
busting through that room

00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:02,831
and then we're all dead.

00:21:02,831 --> 00:21:05,134
Unless you let me
call them off.

00:21:05,134 --> 00:21:07,369
What's it gonna be?

00:21:09,838 --> 00:21:10,839
Mark?

00:21:16,512 --> 00:21:19,014
Jim, we're okay.
Do you copy me?

00:21:19,014 --> 00:21:20,849
What the hell's going on
in there?

00:21:20,849 --> 00:21:23,452
We just had a little family
disagreement, that's all.

00:21:23,452 --> 00:21:25,454
Mark and I
are working it out here.

00:21:25,454 --> 00:21:27,856
I'm gonna need a few minutes.

00:21:27,856 --> 00:21:29,425
I will call you back.

00:21:29,425 --> 00:21:33,329
You and I have nothing to say.
Now sit down.

00:21:33,329 --> 00:21:35,297
Sit down, man!

00:21:35,297 --> 00:21:36,565
DOLAN:
<i>This kid's a time bomb.</i>

00:21:36,565 --> 00:21:38,400
Thermal imaging can give us
a heat signature

00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,069
on anybody in that room.

00:21:40,069 --> 00:21:42,171
We could put a .30 cal round
right through the wall.

00:21:42,171 --> 00:21:43,305
End it right now.

00:21:43,305 --> 00:21:44,873
And what assurance
do we have

00:21:44,873 --> 00:21:46,575
that you're gonna target
the right signature?

00:21:46,575 --> 00:21:48,544
I agree.
We're not gonna wait
this kid out.

00:21:48,544 --> 00:21:51,113
He killed cops! He knows he's
not walking out of here alive!

00:21:51,113 --> 00:21:53,249
That sounds like you've
already made the decision

00:21:53,249 --> 00:21:55,217
that nobody's walking
out of there alive. You!
You're the one...

00:21:55,217 --> 00:21:56,885
You better watch
who you're poking!

00:21:56,885 --> 00:21:59,388
Calm down! Calm down!
The two of you calm down!

00:21:59,388 --> 00:22:01,290
That's an order!
Calm down.

00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:05,327
Dolan, my heart is with you...

00:22:07,529 --> 00:22:09,832
...but my head is with Nick.

00:22:09,832 --> 00:22:12,334
Now, Russell's in there,
and I'm gonna give him a chance

00:22:12,334 --> 00:22:14,069
to talk this kid out of there.

00:22:14,069 --> 00:22:17,373
But we also need to give CSI
a chance to work this case.

00:22:17,373 --> 00:22:19,508
The better we know Powell,

00:22:19,508 --> 00:22:22,845
the better the chances are
to get Russell and Baker
out of there alive.

00:22:22,845 --> 00:22:25,047
You got it?

00:22:25,047 --> 00:22:28,050
SANDERS:
Powell's mother said
she hadn't seen much of him

00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:29,485
the past couple weeks.

00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,056
Now we know why.

00:22:34,056 --> 00:22:36,091
He's been living in here.

00:22:36,091 --> 00:22:39,061
The usual smell of teen spirit.

00:22:39,061 --> 00:22:40,829
Yeah, and teen angst.

00:22:40,829 --> 00:22:42,998
Self-hatred, depression.

00:22:42,998 --> 00:22:44,199
Looking at his journal,

00:22:44,199 --> 00:22:45,401
I'd say
that he'd be more likely

00:22:45,401 --> 00:22:47,603
to commit suicide than homicide.

00:22:47,603 --> 00:22:49,371
(camera shutter clicking)

00:22:53,976 --> 00:22:58,814
Looks like he found another
outlet for his feelings.

00:22:58,814 --> 00:23:00,449
Did his homework, too.

00:23:00,449 --> 00:23:04,019
Even downloaded blueprints of
the PD from county archives.

00:23:04,019 --> 00:23:05,487
He's been planning this
for a while.

00:23:05,487 --> 00:23:07,122
BRODY:
But not planning it alone.

00:23:07,122 --> 00:23:08,957
Take a look at this.

00:23:10,125 --> 00:23:12,828
There are hundreds of e-mails

00:23:12,828 --> 00:23:14,363
and IMs going back and forth

00:23:14,363 --> 00:23:17,966
between Powell and this
username LookingGlass419.

00:23:17,966 --> 00:23:20,302
This e-mail exchange
is from six months ago.

00:23:20,302 --> 00:23:22,371
"Saw another po-po shooting
on the news.

00:23:22,371 --> 00:23:24,206
"Homeless guy shot 16 times.

00:23:24,206 --> 00:23:26,475
Since when is sleeping
on a bench a crime?"

00:23:26,475 --> 00:23:28,977
Powell responds:
"5-0 got no respect."

00:23:28,977 --> 00:23:31,814
LookingGlass: "Maybe someone
needs to teach 'em some."

00:23:31,814 --> 00:23:33,282
BRODY:
More e-mails like that.

00:23:33,282 --> 00:23:35,451
LookingGlass talks about
how much he hates the cops,

00:23:35,451 --> 00:23:36,885
Powell agrees.

00:23:36,885 --> 00:23:39,888
Then LookingGlass
suggests a plan

00:23:39,888 --> 00:23:41,590
to attack police stations.

00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:44,093
Some kind of suicide pact.

00:23:44,093 --> 00:23:45,527
Powell is suicidal,

00:23:45,527 --> 00:23:47,363
but he wouldn't be able
to do this on his own.

00:23:47,363 --> 00:23:48,564
He needs an alpha; someone

00:23:48,564 --> 00:23:50,165
to give him
a sense of purpose

00:23:50,165 --> 00:23:52,101
and meaning in his life
that he's missing.

00:23:52,101 --> 00:23:54,203
I think you're right.

00:23:54,203 --> 00:23:57,039
This last e-mail exchange
is from ten days ago.

00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:00,509
LookingGlass: "It's on.
I selected targets. You in?"

00:24:00,509 --> 00:24:04,146
Powell: "Bring the pain.
Let them never forget."

00:24:04,146 --> 00:24:06,081
LookingGlass:
"I got guns, burner phones.

00:24:06,081 --> 00:24:09,385
From now on,
total radio silence."

00:24:09,385 --> 00:24:12,087
All right, so we know
Powell's part of the plan.

00:24:12,087 --> 00:24:14,857
Now what about
LookingGlass,

00:24:14,857 --> 00:24:16,992
what's his target?
Which police station?

00:24:16,992 --> 00:24:18,927
And when's he gonna strike?

00:24:18,927 --> 00:24:22,231
Listen to me now, Mrs. Powell.
I think that Mark had help

00:24:22,231 --> 00:24:23,999
planning this attack
from somebody,

00:24:23,999 --> 00:24:26,001
somebody who got in his head
and encouraged him

00:24:26,001 --> 00:24:27,302
to do the things
that he's done.

00:24:27,302 --> 00:24:28,837
I don't understand.

00:24:28,837 --> 00:24:31,807
A partner.
There's somebody else out there

00:24:31,807 --> 00:24:33,008
planning an attack.

00:24:33,008 --> 00:24:34,576
Maybe an attack
on a police station.

00:24:34,576 --> 00:24:37,413
If we can find him,
stop him,

00:24:37,413 --> 00:24:40,048
then maybe he can help us
stop your son.

00:24:40,048 --> 00:24:42,017
We found some e-mails.

00:24:42,017 --> 00:24:45,320
This partner goes
by the screen name

00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,022
"LookingGlass419."

00:24:47,022 --> 00:24:48,390
Does that sound
familiar to you?

00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:51,093
No. I'm sorry,
it doesn't.

00:24:51,093 --> 00:24:52,428
Not somebody he hangs out with?

00:24:52,428 --> 00:24:53,929
A friend of his
from high school?

00:24:53,929 --> 00:24:55,330
Anything like that?

00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:56,565
A friend?

00:24:56,565 --> 00:24:58,834
Mark doesn't
have any friends.

00:25:01,103 --> 00:25:02,471
Not since Elliot was killed.

00:25:02,471 --> 00:25:03,472
Who's Elliot?

00:25:03,472 --> 00:25:04,940
The neighbor's boy.

00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:07,843
But he was more like
a brother to Mark.

00:25:07,843 --> 00:25:10,045
He spent a lot of time
at our house...

00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,515
before he got into drugs.

00:25:13,515 --> 00:25:16,151
About a year ago,
Elliot robbed
a liquor store.

00:25:16,151 --> 00:25:17,920
(voice breaks):
The police cornered him,

00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:21,924
they thought he had a gun,
so they shot him.

00:25:21,924 --> 00:25:27,029
After Elliot was killed,
Mark was inconsolable.

00:25:27,029 --> 00:25:29,932
You know, that would explain
his e-mails expressing

00:25:29,932 --> 00:25:31,099
his hatred
for the police.

00:25:31,099 --> 00:25:32,468
Mark said
a lot of stupid things.

00:25:32,468 --> 00:25:33,969
He's a teenager!

00:25:33,969 --> 00:25:35,471
He's done a lot
of stupid things now, too,

00:25:35,471 --> 00:25:38,340
hasn't he? I'm familiar
with that juvie record.

00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:40,275
He's been arrested
multiple times for

00:25:40,275 --> 00:25:42,144
vandalism, assault...
I know!

00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:43,979
You know, and you didn't
do anything about it?

00:25:43,979 --> 00:25:45,247
You didn't see the warning signs

00:25:45,247 --> 00:25:47,115
that he was capable
of something like this?

00:25:47,115 --> 00:25:50,285
I did. I got
him into therapy

00:25:50,285 --> 00:25:52,387
and into after-school
programs.

00:25:52,387 --> 00:25:56,158
I mean, even one of your
own Police Youth Sports Camps.

00:25:56,158 --> 00:25:58,861
(voice breaks):
Mark started going
to church with me.

00:25:58,861 --> 00:26:01,129
We prayed to
Saint Christopher.

00:26:01,129 --> 00:26:02,965
I gave him a medal.

00:26:02,965 --> 00:26:05,567
And I told him that every time
he got upset about Elliot,

00:26:05,567 --> 00:26:07,402
sad or angry,
that he should pray

00:26:07,402 --> 00:26:09,204
until the anger left him.

00:26:11,106 --> 00:26:13,208
I love my son.

00:26:14,576 --> 00:26:18,213
I swear, I tried.

00:26:23,118 --> 00:26:24,953
Mitch, hi.
Sara.

00:26:24,953 --> 00:26:26,121
How you doing?

00:26:26,121 --> 00:26:28,323
I've been better.

00:26:28,323 --> 00:26:30,125
I just want to get out of here.

00:26:30,125 --> 00:26:31,560
Well, it's gonna be
a little while.

00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,061
You were shot in the stomach.

00:26:33,061 --> 00:26:36,198
Did we at least get
the damn shooter?

00:26:36,198 --> 00:26:40,068
He's on lockdown.
Russell's on it.

00:26:40,068 --> 00:26:41,370
You hang tough, okay?

00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:43,005
(indistinct conversations,
phones ringing)

00:27:00,822 --> 00:27:02,324
He's gone.

00:27:05,427 --> 00:27:07,996
Blake, he's-he's...

00:27:07,996 --> 00:27:09,531
he's dead. (sniffles)

00:27:09,531 --> 00:27:11,466
I'm so sorry.

00:27:11,466 --> 00:27:14,336
You know, it's crazy,

00:27:14,336 --> 00:27:17,873
but I can't stop playing it over
and over in my head.

00:27:17,873 --> 00:27:20,542
All the "if only's,"

00:27:20,542 --> 00:27:23,946
all the dominoes
that line up and fall over,

00:27:23,946 --> 00:27:27,115
and we have no idea where
they're gonna take us.

00:27:27,115 --> 00:27:30,018
You know, Miller's kid's sick,
so she leaves early,

00:27:30,018 --> 00:27:32,087
so I shift Dolan to patrol,

00:27:32,087 --> 00:27:35,557
which means I put Blake
at the reception desk.

00:27:35,557 --> 00:27:37,426
You couldn't have known
this was gonna happen.

00:27:37,426 --> 00:27:38,894
It's not your fault.

00:27:38,894 --> 00:27:40,095
That's my point.

00:27:40,095 --> 00:27:41,997
All the little pieces...

00:27:44,099 --> 00:27:47,002
...if it hadn't all gone
the way that it did, then...

00:27:49,938 --> 00:27:51,940
...Blake would-would
still be here.

00:27:53,976 --> 00:27:55,911
Alive.

00:28:08,924 --> 00:28:10,459
(Jacob groaning)

00:28:13,829 --> 00:28:15,030
(groans)

00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,932
(groans)
This sucks!

00:28:16,932 --> 00:28:19,001
I think the pills
are starting to wear off.

00:28:19,001 --> 00:28:21,336
I'm sorry. I wish
I could help, but I think

00:28:21,336 --> 00:28:23,905
you've topped out
on the dosage there.

00:28:26,508 --> 00:28:29,144
You're not looking
for yourself on the
news, are you?

00:28:29,144 --> 00:28:31,013
You keep checking
your phone.

00:28:31,013 --> 00:28:35,150
You're waiting for a text
or a news report or something.

00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:38,053
Is there someone else
is out there, Mark?
Someone who's

00:28:38,053 --> 00:28:39,821
gonna do
the same thing you just did?

00:28:39,821 --> 00:28:43,191
Just shut up, man.

00:28:43,191 --> 00:28:44,893
You don't know a damn thing.

00:28:47,295 --> 00:28:48,296
You've changed.

00:28:48,296 --> 00:28:49,531
Just shut up.

00:28:49,531 --> 00:28:51,366
You said you wanted
to die today,

00:28:51,366 --> 00:28:53,301
but something's
different.

00:28:53,301 --> 00:28:56,905
I know a little something
about the will to survive,

00:28:56,905 --> 00:29:00,075
and I think I'm seeing
that in you right now.

00:29:00,075 --> 00:29:01,943
You want to survive,
don't you?

00:29:01,943 --> 00:29:03,545
(Jacob coughing)

00:29:03,545 --> 00:29:06,081
You all right, Jacob?
You having trouble breathing?

00:29:06,081 --> 00:29:07,849
My chest feels kinda heavy.

00:29:07,849 --> 00:29:09,518
(gasping)

00:29:09,518 --> 00:29:11,486
Okay, all right, we're
gonna take care of you.

00:29:11,486 --> 00:29:13,889
I think the bullet nicked
his lung.

00:29:13,889 --> 00:29:15,524
It's starting to fill up
with blood.

00:29:15,524 --> 00:29:18,026
So? Look...

00:29:18,026 --> 00:29:19,528
do-do something.

00:29:19,528 --> 00:29:22,330
Listen to me. I can't.
He needs a doctor.

00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:23,999
He needs a hospital, Mark.

00:29:23,999 --> 00:29:25,534
(Jacob coughs)

00:29:25,534 --> 00:29:27,436
I can't do that, man!

00:29:27,436 --> 00:29:29,471
Jacob is not a cop, man!

00:29:29,471 --> 00:29:32,541
He's not one of those people
you declared war on!

00:29:32,541 --> 00:29:34,409
You-You know this
bullet in here?

00:29:34,409 --> 00:29:36,445
That's a police bullet.

00:29:36,445 --> 00:29:39,848
You let him die now,
it's not gonna be on them.

00:29:39,848 --> 00:29:43,051
It's gonna be on you.
Is that what you want?

00:29:46,354 --> 00:29:49,524
Call ahead.
Let 'em know our ETA.

00:29:49,524 --> 00:29:51,560
Watch your back.

00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,195
Russell was able
to talk Mark Powell

00:29:53,195 --> 00:29:54,596
into letting
the wounded kid go.

00:29:54,596 --> 00:29:56,364
Maybe he's finally getting
through to him.

00:29:56,364 --> 00:29:58,233
If not, where are we
on the partner?

00:29:58,233 --> 00:30:00,135
Greg's got the warrant.

00:30:00,135 --> 00:30:02,404
He's tracing the e-mails from
LookingGlass419 as we speak.

00:30:02,404 --> 00:30:03,872
We should know something soon.

00:30:06,241 --> 00:30:08,343
RUSSELL:
You're going be okay, Jacob.

00:30:08,343 --> 00:30:10,512
Thanks.

00:30:10,512 --> 00:30:11,480
I hope you get out of here.

00:30:13,982 --> 00:30:15,817
Both of you.

00:30:17,486 --> 00:30:19,154
All right,
let's move out.

00:30:19,154 --> 00:30:20,922
Hold your fire.
He's coming out.

00:30:25,026 --> 00:30:27,262
(door closes)

00:30:27,262 --> 00:30:28,563
Hang in there.
We got you.

00:30:28,563 --> 00:30:29,931
Make way for him.

00:30:29,931 --> 00:30:31,466
(phone rings)

00:30:31,466 --> 00:30:33,335
Yo, what do you got
for me, Finlay?

00:30:33,335 --> 00:30:35,837
Greg's been running a trace
on LookingGlass.

00:30:35,837 --> 00:30:39,141
Nick, what he's found
does not make any sense.

00:30:39,141 --> 00:30:40,509
What do you mean? Tell me.

00:30:40,509 --> 00:30:42,577
All of the the e-mails came
from one server.

00:30:42,577 --> 00:30:44,946
Whoever is Powell's partner,

00:30:44,946 --> 00:30:47,349
whoever he has been
communicating with...

00:30:47,349 --> 00:30:50,385
is someone inside
the police department.

00:30:55,056 --> 00:30:56,558
Officer Dunn,
give me a minute.

00:30:56,558 --> 00:30:57,993
Take a break.

00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:03,331
(door closes)

00:31:03,331 --> 00:31:04,466
Are you sure about this?

00:31:04,466 --> 00:31:06,134
Greg verified the server's IP.

00:31:06,134 --> 00:31:08,336
At least half the e-mails
the shooter received

00:31:08,336 --> 00:31:10,972
have been sent
from a computer
inside PD.

00:31:10,972 --> 00:31:12,841
What the hell
is going on here?

00:31:12,841 --> 00:31:16,011
Look, all this time
we thought LookingGlass419

00:31:16,011 --> 00:31:17,579
was just some
other screwed-up kid

00:31:17,579 --> 00:31:19,581
looking to shoot up
some other police station.

00:31:19,581 --> 00:31:22,017
Like this was some kind
of suicide pact.

00:31:22,017 --> 00:31:23,585
But I'm telling you, Jim,

00:31:23,585 --> 00:31:27,489
LookingGlass is one
of us, it's a cop.

00:31:27,489 --> 00:31:29,391
And there was never
some other target.

00:31:29,391 --> 00:31:31,993
This has always been
the target, LVPD.

00:31:31,993 --> 00:31:33,461
Yeah, but-but why?

00:31:33,461 --> 00:31:35,130
Why would a cop do <i>this?</i>

00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:36,865
STOKES:
Whatever the motive,

00:31:36,865 --> 00:31:38,066
man, this is crazy.

00:31:39,234 --> 00:31:42,370
Yeah.
Yeah, this is crazy.

00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:43,538
I want this guy.

00:31:43,538 --> 00:31:44,973
STOKES:
Whoever it is,

00:31:44,973 --> 00:31:47,108
they knew Mark Powell very well.

00:31:47,108 --> 00:31:48,510
They know he hates cops,

00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:50,145
and they know
he's a ticking time bomb.

00:31:50,145 --> 00:31:52,147
So you say that
all the messages

00:31:52,147 --> 00:31:53,315
came from
our server?

00:31:53,315 --> 00:31:54,482
Which computer?
I don't know.

00:31:54,482 --> 00:31:56,384
<i>Greg's running it right now.</i>

00:32:16,338 --> 00:32:17,405
(exhales)

00:32:17,405 --> 00:32:19,207
Not happening, is it?

00:32:19,207 --> 00:32:20,942
Whatever it is
you're waiting for.

00:32:22,978 --> 00:32:25,313
Or... whoever it is
you're waiting for.

00:32:27,015 --> 00:32:28,817
No, i-it will, okay?
We had...

00:32:28,817 --> 00:32:30,318
we had a plan.

00:32:30,318 --> 00:32:31,553
He won't let me down.
(sniffs)

00:32:31,553 --> 00:32:33,922
I think he already has.

00:32:33,922 --> 00:32:35,490
And I think
you know that.

00:32:36,825 --> 00:32:39,828
Mark...

00:32:39,828 --> 00:32:41,897
I know it seems like
there's no way out

00:32:41,897 --> 00:32:43,431
for you right now.

00:32:43,431 --> 00:32:45,100
But there is...
There isn't.

00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:47,168
Yeah, I blew away
a bunch of cops!

00:32:47,168 --> 00:32:48,937
They're just
gonna kill me!

00:32:48,937 --> 00:32:50,438
Not if you walk out...

00:32:50,438 --> 00:32:51,573
with me.

00:32:51,573 --> 00:32:53,074
And then what?
(sniffles)

00:32:56,344 --> 00:32:57,879
Do you think I'm crazy?

00:32:57,879 --> 00:32:59,881
No, I don't.

00:32:59,881 --> 00:33:01,383
That's too bad.

00:33:01,383 --> 00:33:03,184
(sniffles)

00:33:03,184 --> 00:33:04,953
It's looking like that's
all I got left, you know?

00:33:04,953 --> 00:33:06,087
Some kind of insanity plea.

00:33:06,087 --> 00:33:08,089
I just don't
want to spend

00:33:08,089 --> 00:33:09,958
the rest of my
life in a cage.

00:33:09,958 --> 00:33:12,093
It's not about what you want.

00:33:12,093 --> 00:33:15,397
You gave that up
when you walked in here.

00:33:15,397 --> 00:33:17,032
I'm-I'm not gonna lie to you.

00:33:17,032 --> 00:33:19,301
There are gonna be consequences,
obviously,

00:33:19,301 --> 00:33:23,104
but if you choose
to live, man, there's...

00:33:23,104 --> 00:33:25,206
you can make something
out of that life.

00:33:36,084 --> 00:33:38,053
What if I don't?

00:33:38,053 --> 00:33:40,121
Don't you do that.

00:33:40,121 --> 00:33:41,456
(sniffles)

00:33:45,527 --> 00:33:46,861
(grunts)

00:33:46,861 --> 00:33:48,463
(panting)

00:33:50,065 --> 00:33:52,033
Okay, I won't.

00:33:52,033 --> 00:33:53,969
Okay, then,

00:33:53,969 --> 00:33:55,904
you're going
to do it.

00:33:55,904 --> 00:33:59,507
Kill me...

00:33:59,507 --> 00:34:01,376
or I will kill you.

00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,595
No one else is gonna
die here today.

00:34:26,968 --> 00:34:28,903
(gasping)

00:34:31,873 --> 00:34:33,808
(sobbing)

00:34:48,123 --> 00:34:49,924
BRODY:
How's the trace going?

00:34:49,924 --> 00:34:52,093
Figure out which computer
at PD sent e-mails to Powell?

00:34:52,093 --> 00:34:54,029
It's a bit more
complicated than I thought.

00:34:54,029 --> 00:34:56,564
I'm comparing each terminal's
user history

00:34:56,564 --> 00:34:58,833
with the server history.

00:34:58,833 --> 00:35:01,236
It's a process of elimination,
until I find a match...

00:35:01,236 --> 00:35:02,570
How many terminals are there?

00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:04,205
Seventy-two.
How many have you done?

00:35:04,205 --> 00:35:05,340
Eleven.

00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:06,474
I'll help.

00:35:16,084 --> 00:35:17,285
I just heard.
Is it true?

00:35:17,285 --> 00:35:18,887
Is the kid gonna
give himself up?

00:35:18,887 --> 00:35:20,889
Yeah, it seems that
Russell talked him out.

00:35:20,889 --> 00:35:21,990
You think he's
on the level?

00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:23,324
Well, we'll know
in a second.

00:35:36,938 --> 00:35:38,339
RUSSELL:
Jim, we're coming out!

00:35:40,875 --> 00:35:42,343
Wait for my call.

00:35:59,561 --> 00:36:01,396
BRASS:
That's far enough.

00:36:03,098 --> 00:36:05,834
D.B., I need you to step aside.

00:36:05,834 --> 00:36:07,102
Sir.
No, no, you're fine.

00:36:07,102 --> 00:36:09,104
You're fine. Just do
everything they say.

00:36:09,104 --> 00:36:11,272
I'm right here.

00:36:12,941 --> 00:36:14,476
BRASS:
All right, Mark.

00:36:14,476 --> 00:36:17,078
I want you to do
exactly as I tell you,

00:36:17,078 --> 00:36:18,446
and only

00:36:18,446 --> 00:36:19,380
what I tell you.

00:36:21,449 --> 00:36:23,251
Put your hands above your head

00:36:23,251 --> 00:36:24,385
and interlock your fingers.

00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:33,394
Get down on your knees.

00:36:33,394 --> 00:36:34,596
Mark, do what they say.

00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:43,271
I got him.

00:36:43,271 --> 00:36:45,974
BRASS:
Now lay flat on your stomach.

00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:57,852
BRODY:
Let's get this
info to Brass.

00:36:57,852 --> 00:37:00,288
You heard him!
Get down! Now!

00:37:10,331 --> 00:37:11,566
Gun!

00:37:11,566 --> 00:37:13,501
RUSSELL:
Mark, no. Mark, no!

00:37:14,836 --> 00:37:17,005
(gunfire)

00:37:18,206 --> 00:37:19,307
(shell casings clattering)

00:37:47,402 --> 00:37:49,437
Oh...

00:37:53,508 --> 00:37:55,410
He was reaching for a gun.

00:37:59,314 --> 00:38:00,381
He was reaching for this.

00:38:08,489 --> 00:38:09,824
Officer Dolan.

00:38:09,824 --> 00:38:10,992
Give me your weapon.

00:38:10,992 --> 00:38:12,227
It was a good
shoot, Captain.

00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:16,998
Put him into custody.

00:38:18,099 --> 00:38:20,068
Captain, it was a good shoot.

00:38:21,302 --> 00:38:22,904
What's going on?

00:38:22,904 --> 00:38:24,372
This doesn't
make any sense.

00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:36,985
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Lab tech to Radiology.

00:38:36,985 --> 00:38:38,853
Lab tech
to Radiology.

00:38:45,026 --> 00:38:46,894
We got the shooter.

00:38:46,894 --> 00:38:48,296
I heard.

00:38:48,296 --> 00:38:50,064
We also, uh, tracked down
the computer in PD

00:38:50,064 --> 00:38:52,200
that Powell was
communicating with.

00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,568
Who was it?

00:38:53,568 --> 00:38:55,370
Dolan.

00:38:57,338 --> 00:38:58,906
Oh, my God.

00:38:58,906 --> 00:39:00,541
The marital troubles
that you talked about,

00:39:00,541 --> 00:39:02,076
Dolan was the
other man?

00:39:02,076 --> 00:39:04,045
He said that
after you

00:39:04,045 --> 00:39:05,913
went back to Blake,
he couldn't handle it.

00:39:05,913 --> 00:39:07,515
He said he couldn't
stop calling,

00:39:07,515 --> 00:39:08,983
he wouldn't
leave you alone.

00:39:08,983 --> 00:39:11,519
So-so Dolan was
behind all this?

00:39:13,321 --> 00:39:14,555
I don't believe it.

00:39:14,555 --> 00:39:16,324
Yeah, neither do I.

00:39:16,324 --> 00:39:19,060
The e-mails came from
Dolan's computer,

00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,962
but we checked
the duty roster.

00:39:20,962 --> 00:39:23,298
He wasn't there
when they were sent.

00:39:23,298 --> 00:39:26,067
So... he had nothing
to do with this.

00:39:26,067 --> 00:39:28,069
S-So it was
someone else?

00:39:28,069 --> 00:39:30,305
Somebody who had a
connection to Powell.

00:39:30,305 --> 00:39:31,973
Somebody that he
crossed paths with

00:39:31,973 --> 00:39:33,941
when he was trying to
straighten his life out.

00:39:33,941 --> 00:39:38,313
We found this
photo from, uh...

00:39:38,313 --> 00:39:42,483
last year's Police
Youth Sports Camp.

00:39:42,483 --> 00:39:43,518
I don't believe this, Sara.

00:39:43,518 --> 00:39:45,053
That kid killed
my husband.

00:39:46,321 --> 00:39:48,823
He killed Blake.
Yeah.

00:39:48,823 --> 00:39:50,458
He did, Debra.

00:39:50,458 --> 00:39:53,127
Because you set the
dominoes in motion.

00:39:53,127 --> 00:39:55,863
Like you said, "All
those little pieces..."

00:39:55,863 --> 00:39:57,832
We searched your house,
we found your laptop.

00:39:57,832 --> 00:39:59,567
You created
LookingGlass419.

00:39:59,567 --> 00:40:01,836
We searched your locker and
we found the burner phone

00:40:01,836 --> 00:40:03,171
that you used
to text Powell.

00:40:03,171 --> 00:40:05,807
You gave him the "go"
two minutes after

00:40:05,807 --> 00:40:07,975
you put your husband
on the reception desk.

00:40:07,975 --> 00:40:09,177
You took advantage of

00:40:09,177 --> 00:40:10,812
a mentally unstable
16-year-old boy,

00:40:10,812 --> 00:40:12,046
you used him to
kill your husband

00:40:12,046 --> 00:40:13,448
and you designed
it to look like

00:40:13,448 --> 00:40:15,583
some random
explosion of violence.

00:40:15,583 --> 00:40:17,151
You betrayed
your badge.

00:40:17,151 --> 00:40:18,519
You didn't care who
else he wounded,

00:40:18,519 --> 00:40:20,521
you didn't care who
else he killed.

00:40:20,521 --> 00:40:21,989
Why did you do this?

00:40:21,989 --> 00:40:24,058
Because Blake was never
going to let me go?

00:40:24,058 --> 00:40:25,093
He beat me?

00:40:25,093 --> 00:40:26,561
I-I did it for
the insurance?

00:40:26,561 --> 00:40:28,496
I don't know, Sara,
come on.

00:40:28,496 --> 00:40:29,831
Do you... do you
really think that

00:40:29,831 --> 00:40:30,832
there's anything

00:40:30,832 --> 00:40:32,100
that I could
say to you

00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:34,402
to make you
understand?

00:40:34,402 --> 00:40:35,470
Y...

00:40:39,207 --> 00:40:41,275
Before I... I say
anything else,

00:40:41,275 --> 00:40:43,211
I really think
that I sh...

00:40:43,211 --> 00:40:46,881
I should speak
to my police reps.

00:40:46,881 --> 00:40:48,383
You do that.

00:40:51,552 --> 00:40:53,321
(handcuffs clicking)

00:41:18,479 --> 00:41:20,415
♪ ♪

00:41:33,027 --> 00:41:36,030
In the news, they're going
to make him into a monster.

00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:37,365
(crying):
But he wasn't.

00:41:43,438 --> 00:41:44,872
You were with him at the end?

00:41:44,872 --> 00:41:46,507
Yes, ma'am.

00:41:46,507 --> 00:41:48,342
What did you see?

00:41:50,077 --> 00:41:51,512
Well, I saw...

00:41:51,512 --> 00:41:53,848
(sniffles)

00:41:53,848 --> 00:41:57,185
I saw a young man
who was confused

00:41:57,185 --> 00:41:58,920
and in a lot of pain.

00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,122
I saw what you saw.

00:42:01,122 --> 00:42:03,357
And whatever
you hear

00:42:03,357 --> 00:42:05,426
in the days to come...

00:42:05,426 --> 00:42:06,994
only God can judge.

00:42:10,431 --> 00:42:12,867
And God can forgive, too.

00:42:15,536 --> 00:42:17,271
