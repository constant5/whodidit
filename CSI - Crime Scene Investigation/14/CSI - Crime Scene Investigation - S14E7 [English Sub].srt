Hello.

00:00:21,288 --> 00:00:23,257
SIDLE: I heard you cleared
your scene. Nice work.

00:00:23,257 --> 00:00:24,959
Would you mind, um,
picking me up a veggie burger

00:00:24,959 --> 00:00:26,293
from RJ's on your way back?

00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:27,928
I guess. They do have
a drive-through.

00:00:27,928 --> 00:00:29,129
BRODY:
Hey, it's Morgan.

00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:30,931
Uh, mind picking up me

00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:33,100
a veggie burger, too,
and Finn a grilled cheese?

00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,935
All right, but you ladies
are gonna owe me.

00:00:34,935 --> 00:00:36,704
MORGAN: Thanks.

00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:38,959

<i>Weather Service has issued</i>

00:00:38,959 --> 00:00:41,262

a close watch

00:00:51,906 --> 00:00:54,308
(groans)
It is nasty out there.

00:00:54,308 --> 00:00:56,911
Can't argue with that.

00:00:56,911 --> 00:00:58,879
Maybe we shouldn't have sent
Greg to get our food.

00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,381
No, he's a...
he's a great swimmer.

00:01:00,381 --> 00:01:01,749
ANDREWS:
Wait, Greg's on a chow run?

00:01:01,749 --> 00:01:04,051
I could really use some soup.
Ooh, or chili.

00:01:04,051 --> 00:01:06,487
Yeah, actually you guys are
gonna have to fend for yourself

00:01:06,487 --> 00:01:07,922
out of the
refrigerator tonight.

00:01:07,922 --> 00:01:09,690
Uh, yeah.
Wouldn't be the first time.

00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:10,958
I knew that was you.

00:01:10,958 --> 00:01:12,460
All right, all
right, listen up...

00:01:13,961 --> 00:01:15,930
Wow.

00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,699
P.D. just pulled a man
out of a flood channel

00:01:18,699 --> 00:01:21,368
with a suspicious head injury;
we need to process him.

00:01:21,368 --> 00:01:22,870
Treat it like a crime
until we know otherwise.

00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:24,805
Who's up next?
That'd be me.

00:01:24,805 --> 00:01:26,707
(clears throat)
Sorry.

00:01:26,707 --> 00:01:28,809
Thank you.

00:01:28,809 --> 00:01:32,546
Got a male, early 30s, severe
hypothermia and head injuries.

00:01:32,546 --> 00:01:33,914
Okay, take him
to room three.

00:01:33,914 --> 00:01:35,649
This your guy
from the flood channel?

00:01:35,649 --> 00:01:37,551
Yeah, he's lucky his bag
got stuck on a tree limb.

00:01:37,551 --> 00:01:39,320
Kept him from washing
further downstream.

00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,388
Doctor, we need you
in room three, stat!

00:01:41,388 --> 00:01:43,524
Agonal respirations
on contact.

00:01:43,524 --> 00:01:45,726
Weak brachial pulse,
unable to get a BP.

00:01:45,726 --> 00:01:47,828

00:01:47,828 --> 00:01:49,463
NURSE:
Glucose is 50 mg.

00:01:49,463 --> 00:01:50,931
Any I.D. on him?

00:01:50,931 --> 00:01:52,366
If there is, it'll be in there.

00:01:52,366 --> 00:01:53,834
DOCTOR: Breathing is
shallow but regular.

00:01:53,834 --> 00:01:55,736
Blood pressure is 85/50.
I'll get him on the monitor.

00:01:55,736 --> 00:01:57,571
EMT: There wasn't any
obvious swelling to the head.

00:01:57,571 --> 00:01:58,839
Laceration's deep.

00:01:58,839 --> 00:01:59,974
DOCTOR: Make sure
we get a core temperature.

00:01:59,974 --> 00:02:01,275
Let's start by warming him.

00:02:01,275 --> 00:02:02,643
Then we'll address
the head wound.

00:02:03,744 --> 00:02:05,779
G-Guys?

00:02:05,779 --> 00:02:08,549
Back out of here slowly
and take him with you.

00:02:08,549 --> 00:02:09,884
What is it?

00:02:09,884 --> 00:02:12,286
Bomb!

00:02:12,286 --> 00:02:13,387
And it's armed.

Ms. Rhodes is here

00:06:32,312 --> 00:06:36,683
to review the evidence
on <i>People v. Gus Ellis,</i> 2006.

00:06:36,683 --> 00:06:39,386
Yeah, that, uh,
doesn't ring a bell.

00:06:39,386 --> 00:06:41,622
Ms. Rhodes,
wh-why don't you give us

00:06:41,622 --> 00:06:44,825
the <i>Reader's Digest</i>
version.

00:06:44,825 --> 00:06:48,529
Gus Ellis served seven years
of a life sentence

00:06:48,529 --> 00:06:51,331
for the rape/murder of
college student Claire Gibson.

00:06:51,331 --> 00:06:54,668
Since his case
hinged on DNA,

00:06:54,668 --> 00:06:56,503
it fit the Innocence Project's
protocol.

00:06:56,503 --> 00:07:00,941
We extracted touch DNA from
her jeans and her underwear,

00:07:00,941 --> 00:07:05,546
which matched that of serial
sex offender Clyde Maroni.

00:07:05,546 --> 00:07:07,848
Testing wasn't sensitive enough
for touch DNA back in 2006.

00:07:07,848 --> 00:07:12,352
Maroni confessed
and pled to a life sentence.

00:07:12,352 --> 00:07:14,621
Now Gus Ellis is free
and wants answers.

00:07:14,621 --> 00:07:16,857
I've been hired
by his civil attorney

00:07:16,857 --> 00:07:18,425
to see the case through.

00:07:18,425 --> 00:07:21,995
So, if science
proved his innocence

00:07:21,995 --> 00:07:23,831
through new and
improved technology,

00:07:23,831 --> 00:07:25,632
what's the basis
for the lawsuit?

00:07:25,632 --> 00:07:29,469
Well, a week before her murder,

00:07:29,469 --> 00:07:31,705
Claire Gibson called the police
complaining that a man

00:07:31,705 --> 00:07:34,575
was looking at her
through her bedroom window.

00:07:34,575 --> 00:07:37,778
Gus Ellis was identified
as the peeper.

00:07:37,778 --> 00:07:39,680
I remember that.
He was also

00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,317
the one who called 911
from the Gibson murder scene.

00:07:43,317 --> 00:07:46,320
<i>He said that he looked</i>
<i>through the victim's window,</i>

00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,621
<i>saw her lying there,</i>

00:07:47,621 --> 00:07:50,257
<i>and claimed</i>
<i>she was already dead.</i>

00:07:50,257 --> 00:07:53,026
He was arrested that same day,
which we call...

00:07:53,026 --> 00:07:57,397
a rush to judgment.

00:07:57,397 --> 00:07:59,867
He was <i>the</i> person
of interest

00:07:59,867 --> 00:08:02,603
in an investigation
started by the victim.

00:08:02,603 --> 00:08:06,473
A week later, he calls 911
from her murder scene.

00:08:06,473 --> 00:08:08,609
No prints, no semen,

00:08:08,609 --> 00:08:10,711
no evidence linked Mr. Ellis
to the inside of that...

00:08:10,711 --> 00:08:12,479
I-I remember that
there was a crowbar

00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,848
next to her with
his blood on it.

00:08:14,848 --> 00:08:18,552
Mr. Ellis stated that he never
went inside that house

00:08:18,552 --> 00:08:19,953
and he never touched
that crowbar.

00:08:19,953 --> 00:08:21,822
RUSSELL:
He claims only way his blood

00:08:21,822 --> 00:08:24,825
was on that crowbar
is if it were planted.

00:08:24,825 --> 00:08:26,426
What?!

00:08:26,426 --> 00:08:28,395
He's saying that I
planted his blood?

00:08:28,395 --> 00:08:29,863
How?

00:08:29,863 --> 00:08:31,865
A reference blood sample
was collected from Mr. Ellis,

00:08:31,865 --> 00:08:34,768
a blood sample
that you received at the scene.

00:08:34,768 --> 00:08:36,270
(knocking)

00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,604
Come on in.

00:08:37,604 --> 00:08:39,573
Finlay's gonna be working
with Ms. Rhodes

00:08:39,573 --> 00:08:41,341

00:08:41,341 --> 00:08:44,444

I need you on desk duty.

00:08:44,444 --> 00:08:45,712

00:09:00,294 --> 00:09:02,629
He's still out.

00:09:02,629 --> 00:09:03,897
How you doing, Sara?

00:09:03,897 --> 00:09:05,899
I'm a little shaky.

00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:08,402
Nothing like staring into
the abyss for 20 minutes

00:09:08,402 --> 00:09:10,537
to decide what's important
in life.

00:09:10,537 --> 00:09:12,940
It's sad how it takes
something so...

00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:16,410
intense to make us stop
and smell the coffee, huh?

00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:19,780
Bomb guys disrupted the device
to render it safe.

00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,748
I sent what was left
to Hodges.

00:09:21,748 --> 00:09:24,017
Well, police officers are
walking the flood channel.

00:09:24,017 --> 00:09:26,019
It would be good to know
how long he was in there.

00:09:26,019 --> 00:09:27,421
It only takes ten minutes

00:09:27,421 --> 00:09:28,889
in 50-degree water
to get hypothermia,

00:09:28,889 --> 00:09:30,824
but he could've been
in there longer than that.

00:09:30,824 --> 00:09:32,426
He got hung up on
a tree branch.

00:09:32,426 --> 00:09:33,860
We need to quickly I.D. him
and find out

00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,295
what he planned
to do with that bomb.

00:09:35,295 --> 00:09:37,464

Oh. I have a match.

00:09:37,464 --> 00:09:39,433
Uh...

00:09:39,433 --> 00:09:43,303

00:09:51,044 --> 00:09:53,380
Somebody wants to keep
this guy's identity a secret.

00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:56,016
Then we go old-school.

00:09:56,016 --> 00:09:58,885
Police are asking the public's
help in identifying this man.

00:09:58,885 --> 00:10:00,887
He was pulled
from a flood channel tonight

00:10:00,887 --> 00:10:02,622
in serious condition.

00:10:02,622 --> 00:10:05,492
If you have any information
about his identity,

00:10:05,492 --> 00:10:09,029
please call
the Las Vegas Police Department.

00:10:09,029 --> 00:10:11,531
Hey.

00:10:11,531 --> 00:10:14,001
Oh, my God. I am so glad
to see you in one piece.

00:10:14,001 --> 00:10:15,836
(chuckles)
You and me both.

00:10:15,836 --> 00:10:17,771
I got you a veggie burger.
It's in the fridge if you want.

00:10:17,771 --> 00:10:20,741
Thanks. Uh, as soon as I get
my appetite back, I'm...

00:10:20,741 --> 00:10:22,943
Right. Well, you can
have it later, I guess.

00:10:22,943 --> 00:10:25,879
Um, so, I thought in order to
find where our bomber went in,

00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:27,481
we could apply some logic,

00:10:27,481 --> 00:10:30,717
so I got us a map of all
flood channels in Vegas.

00:10:30,717 --> 00:10:33,520
I'm thinking he fell in the
water somewhere near his target.

00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,023
Okay, if I was a bomber,
I would look for someplace

00:10:36,023 --> 00:10:37,457
with a lot of people.

00:10:37,457 --> 00:10:38,825
Probably looking at a casino.

00:10:38,825 --> 00:10:41,628
Guy got pulled
out of the water... here.

00:10:41,628 --> 00:10:43,730
Backtrack upstream.

00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:46,800
Closest likely targets are
the Tangiers, Queen Regent

00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,602
and Mediterranean.
(phone chiming)

00:10:50,504 --> 00:10:51,938
Oh. Our John Doe's awake.

00:10:51,938 --> 00:10:54,841
I'm, uh, heading back
to the hospital.

00:10:54,841 --> 00:10:56,510
See you later.

00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:01,415
(coughing)

00:11:01,415 --> 00:11:03,483
This dust
could be toxic!

00:11:03,483 --> 00:11:05,419
Where's my particle mask?
(coughs)

00:11:05,419 --> 00:11:07,287
You got to die
from something.

00:11:07,287 --> 00:11:09,856
(groans, coughs)

00:11:09,856 --> 00:11:11,591
Man, Sara held certain death

00:11:11,591 --> 00:11:14,461
in her hands for 20 minutes
and never moved.

00:11:14,461 --> 00:11:16,329
Do you think it's true
that your whole life flashes

00:11:16,329 --> 00:11:17,597
before your eyes
in those situations?

00:11:17,597 --> 00:11:19,366
Did for me.

00:11:19,366 --> 00:11:21,001
I'm listening.

00:11:21,001 --> 00:11:23,637
I was 18,
getting my wisdom teeth pulled.

00:11:23,637 --> 00:11:25,405
When I got the anesthetic...

00:11:25,405 --> 00:11:27,774
Malignant hyperthermia
from anesthetic can be fatal.

00:11:27,774 --> 00:11:29,376
They need a crash cart?

00:11:29,376 --> 00:11:30,911
Not exactly.

00:11:30,911 --> 00:11:32,712
It was my first experience
with a mind-altering drug.

00:11:32,712 --> 00:11:34,748
I thought I was dying,

00:11:34,748 --> 00:11:36,550
began to hyperventilate,
hallucinate.

00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:38,285
And?

00:11:38,285 --> 00:11:40,020
In my addled state,

00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:43,657
I fell madly in love
with the dental assistant.

00:11:43,657 --> 00:11:45,959
For some reason,
I had to tell everyone,

00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:47,861
including her.

00:11:47,861 --> 00:11:50,464
Turns out, it was just an
adverse reaction to the drugs.

00:11:50,464 --> 00:11:51,531
(singsong):
Awkward.

00:11:51,531 --> 00:11:53,033
No. Humiliating.

00:11:53,033 --> 00:11:54,568
I never went back.

00:11:54,568 --> 00:11:55,802
I still have my wisdom teeth.

00:11:55,802 --> 00:11:56,937
You?

00:11:56,937 --> 00:11:59,005
Perhaps another time.

00:11:59,005 --> 00:12:00,841
Why don't you take what's
left of the satchel,

00:12:00,841 --> 00:12:02,742
and I'll concentrate
on the bomb frags.

00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,883
MAN:
Margarit t'agavorakan.

00:12:09,883 --> 00:12:11,651
<i>Margarit t'agavorakan.</i>

00:12:11,651 --> 00:12:12,919
BRASS:
That's not English.

00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:14,855
Sounds Slavic or Russian
or something.

00:12:14,855 --> 00:12:16,723
Keeps saying it the same
way over and over again.

00:12:16,723 --> 00:12:18,425
Well, hold on,
I have a translator app.

00:12:18,425 --> 00:12:19,926
Maybe we can figure out
what he's saying.

00:12:22,496 --> 00:12:24,664
<i>Margarit t'agavorakan.</i>

00:12:24,664 --> 00:12:26,299
(phone beeps)

00:12:26,299 --> 00:12:27,834
<i>Margarit t'agavorakan.</i>

00:12:27,834 --> 00:12:29,336
He's speaking Armenian.

00:12:29,336 --> 00:12:32,272
<i>Margarit</i> means "pearl."

00:12:32,272 --> 00:12:33,807
App doesn't recognize the rest.

00:12:33,807 --> 00:12:35,475
Guy with a bomb, speaking
a foreign language,

00:12:35,475 --> 00:12:37,577
possibly in code,
hacked into AFIS

00:12:37,577 --> 00:12:39,012
so we don't
identify him.

00:12:39,012 --> 00:12:41,281
That's a guy with
a lot of expertise.

00:12:41,281 --> 00:12:42,949
That's the profile
for a terrorist.

00:12:42,949 --> 00:12:44,951
One thing I know
about terrorists:

00:12:44,951 --> 00:12:46,653
they never work alone.

00:12:52,259 --> 00:12:53,593
Hey, Finn, I'd really like

00:12:53,593 --> 00:12:54,794
to take a look
at my case notes.

00:12:54,794 --> 00:12:56,263
Greg, I can't talk to you.

00:12:56,263 --> 00:12:58,331
I have to remain
completely objective

00:12:58,331 --> 00:13:00,534
while I work
with the defense expert.

00:13:00,534 --> 00:13:01,968
(sighs)

00:13:01,968 --> 00:13:03,870
FINLAY: <i>Greg Sanders</i>
<i>worked this case solo,</i>

00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,772
so all of the
photographs are his.

00:13:05,772 --> 00:13:08,375
The left screen shows
the digital code--

00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:12,345
shot sequence, date, time,
any edits or deletions.

00:13:12,345 --> 00:13:15,582
So we can tell if any of the
photographs have been altered.

00:13:15,582 --> 00:13:17,384
Greg started by
photographing the exterior

00:13:17,384 --> 00:13:19,886
of the crime scene first,
which is protocol.

00:13:19,886 --> 00:13:23,356
Shots were almost
two minutes apart.

00:13:23,356 --> 00:13:26,660
Looks like he finished
the exteriors just after 0600.

00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:29,296
Now he's moved on,
inside the house.

00:13:29,296 --> 00:13:31,398
Starting with the
body in the bedroom.

00:13:31,398 --> 00:13:34,768
When I was working
crime scenes back in Detroit,

00:13:34,768 --> 00:13:36,803
I liked to save
the victim's room for last.

00:13:36,803 --> 00:13:38,405
Hmm, I'm the opposite.

00:13:38,405 --> 00:13:40,407
I like to work the
toughest room first.

00:13:40,407 --> 00:13:43,777
The first shot of the
bedroom was an overall.

00:13:43,777 --> 00:13:45,045
First shot with
the crowbar

00:13:45,045 --> 00:13:47,547
was a perspective shot.

00:13:47,547 --> 00:13:51,751
RHODES: <i>Now Sanders is moving in</i>
<i>for the close-ups.</i>

00:13:51,751 --> 00:13:54,754
20 minutes later, he finishes
photographing the bedroom.

00:13:54,754 --> 00:13:57,390
Moving on to do
the rest of the house.

00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:59,326
Finishes photographing
the rest of the house

00:13:59,326 --> 00:14:00,627
and returns to
the bedroom.

00:14:00,627 --> 00:14:03,463
What? He took over
50 photographs of the room.

00:14:03,463 --> 00:14:04,798
Why go back?

00:14:04,798 --> 00:14:06,533
Shouldn't he start collection?

00:14:06,533 --> 00:14:09,636
Newer CSIs tend to take
more photographs than they need.

00:14:09,636 --> 00:14:12,038
I was taught that film
is cheap-- of course,

00:14:12,038 --> 00:14:14,608
that was back when
we used film.

00:14:14,608 --> 00:14:16,443
(chuckles)

00:14:18,378 --> 00:14:20,780
Look at that.

00:14:23,383 --> 00:14:26,019
Crowbar's been moved,
up and to the left.

00:14:27,988 --> 00:14:30,357
According to the
Major Incident Log,

00:14:30,357 --> 00:14:31,858
Greg was alone
in the crime scene

00:14:31,858 --> 00:14:35,562
until almost... 0730.

00:14:35,562 --> 00:14:37,030
When did the reference
blood arrive?

00:14:38,698 --> 00:14:40,967
He signed for it at 0705.

00:14:40,967 --> 00:14:43,770
So Sanders was
in the crime scene

00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:47,340
with the reference blood
from Ellis and the crowbar,

00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,309
completely alone.

00:14:49,309 --> 00:14:51,711
(thunder rumbling)

00:14:51,711 --> 00:14:54,447
<i>Margarit t'agavorakan.</i>

00:14:54,447 --> 00:14:57,417
<i>Margarit t'agavorakan.</i>

00:14:57,417 --> 00:14:59,586
Aren't you taking "death
imminent" a little too far?

00:14:59,586 --> 00:15:00,854
Not the first
time we've had

00:15:00,854 --> 00:15:02,622
a live one
in here.
Brass called.

00:15:02,622 --> 00:15:05,325
Wanted to know if I could narrow
down where the guy came from.

00:15:05,325 --> 00:15:06,893
Hospitals are running
on generators,

00:15:06,893 --> 00:15:09,296
not doing any elective tests,
so I brought him over.

00:15:09,296 --> 00:15:10,864
What'd you find out?

00:15:10,864 --> 00:15:13,500
No surgeries, no birthmarks,
scars or identifying features.

00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,669
His teeth are coated
in fluoride,

00:15:15,669 --> 00:15:17,804
and he has a
porcelain filling.

00:15:17,804 --> 00:15:19,639
So if he is
from Armenia,

00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:21,541
he came to America when
he was very young.

00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:24,878
They don't do dental work
like that over there.

00:15:24,878 --> 00:15:26,413
<i>Margarit t'agavorakan.</i>

00:15:26,413 --> 00:15:27,881
Sounds like chanting to me.

00:15:27,881 --> 00:15:29,783
Word repetition.

00:15:29,783 --> 00:15:31,651
Reminds me of a
case where a man

00:15:31,651 --> 00:15:33,887
fell into a frozen
lake in Milwaukee,

00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,889
came out speaking
Portuguese.

00:15:35,889 --> 00:15:37,590
David, fire up the
fluoroscope, please.

00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:39,726
Yeah.
<i>Margarit t'agavorakan.</i>

00:15:41,494 --> 00:15:43,363
<i>Margarit t'agavorakan.</i>

00:15:50,637 --> 00:15:52,539
Bleeding at his temporal lobe.

00:15:52,539 --> 00:15:54,407
Could be a case
where head trauma causes

00:15:54,407 --> 00:15:56,676
a person to speak
a foreign language.

00:15:56,676 --> 00:16:00,914
It's a condition called TGA--
Transient Global Amnesia.

00:16:00,914 --> 00:16:02,449
It only lasts
about 24 hours.

00:16:02,449 --> 00:16:04,284
So, what he's saying
is coming from

00:16:04,284 --> 00:16:06,753
his subconscious,
something important to him.

00:16:06,753 --> 00:16:10,256
<i>Margarit t'agavorakan.</i>

00:16:10,256 --> 00:16:12,525
Mr. Sanders.

00:16:12,525 --> 00:16:14,260
You took these
photographs

00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,729
at the Claire Gibson
crime scene.

00:16:15,729 --> 00:16:17,697
34 minutes apart.

00:16:21,701 --> 00:16:23,536
The crowbar's been moved.

00:16:24,671 --> 00:16:26,306
Did you move it?

00:16:28,441 --> 00:16:29,776
If...

00:16:29,776 --> 00:16:32,879
I saw that the crowbar
had been moved,

00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:34,381
it would be in my notes.

00:16:34,381 --> 00:16:36,015
It's not noted.

00:16:36,015 --> 00:16:37,717
During the time

00:16:37,717 --> 00:16:39,919
between these two photographs,
you were the only person

00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:42,589
inside the crime scene.

00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:45,458
You know, I am so focused
on my own work, I...

00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:46,960
barely notice
what anybody else

00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,896
is doing at a scene.

00:16:49,896 --> 00:16:52,565
My former supervisor,
Gil Grissom,

00:16:52,565 --> 00:16:54,801
trained me to follow
a particular procedure

00:16:54,801 --> 00:16:57,437
so I didn't have to
rely on my memory.

00:16:57,437 --> 00:16:59,873
Now, I was so afraid of
making a mistake and being

00:16:59,873 --> 00:17:01,474
sent back to the lab

00:17:01,474 --> 00:17:03,977
that I followed that
training exactly.

00:17:03,977 --> 00:17:05,545
FINLAY:
And yet, this evidence

00:17:05,545 --> 00:17:07,981
was moved
after it was documented

00:17:07,981 --> 00:17:09,349
and before it was collected.

00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:10,483
RHODES:
That's not protocol

00:17:10,483 --> 00:17:12,552
in any crime lab.

00:17:12,552 --> 00:17:14,387
I would be more than
happy to answer

00:17:14,387 --> 00:17:17,357
your specific questions if I
could just review my notes.

00:17:17,357 --> 00:17:19,492
That's all we need right now.

00:17:21,895 --> 00:17:24,531
Should I be worried?

00:17:24,531 --> 00:17:27,367
Greg, a man served
seven years for a crime

00:17:27,367 --> 00:17:28,701
he did not commit.

00:17:28,701 --> 00:17:30,837
We <i>all</i> should be worried.

00:17:34,741 --> 00:17:37,610
(thunder rumbling)

00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:40,480
I just heard you're in
the middle of a defense review.

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,749
Yeah. Kind of rough.

00:17:42,749 --> 00:17:44,484
It's hell.

00:17:44,484 --> 00:17:46,753
It's the worst part of the job.

00:17:46,753 --> 00:17:49,289
Only, I'm not being accused
of making a mistake;

00:17:49,289 --> 00:17:51,324
I'm being accused
of planting evidence.

00:17:52,392 --> 00:17:53,726
Well...

00:17:53,726 --> 00:17:56,729
the evidence is gonna win out,
Greg, I know it.

00:17:56,729 --> 00:17:58,731
(phone ringing)
Yeah.

00:17:58,731 --> 00:18:01,334
Oh, shoot, I got to go.

00:18:01,334 --> 00:18:03,670
Brass found
the bomber's hotel room.

00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:05,805
I'll call you later, okay?

00:18:10,477 --> 00:18:12,312
(siren whoops,
indistinct police radio chatter)

00:18:12,312 --> 00:18:13,713
BRASS: So, the manager
of the motel

00:18:13,713 --> 00:18:15,949
recognized our John Doe
from the TV news.

00:18:15,949 --> 00:18:17,817
Said he checked in
yesterday.

00:18:17,817 --> 00:18:21,020
After she called the hotline,
right, she checked his room,

00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,822
saw some guy tossing it.

00:18:22,822 --> 00:18:24,357
She get a description?

00:18:24,357 --> 00:18:26,426
No, some guy-- white
guy, blue shirt.

00:18:26,426 --> 00:18:28,862
You know, he saw her, he freaked
out, he jumped off the balcony.

00:18:28,862 --> 00:18:31,030
Here's the manager here;
she has a heart condition.

00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:32,799
She's on the oxygen
and a cigarette.

00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,968
Thanks for your help.
I hope you feel better.

00:18:34,968 --> 00:18:37,036
Got to love Vegas, huh?

00:18:43,009 --> 00:18:45,578
SIDLE: Looks like our bomber's
friends got here before we did.

00:18:45,578 --> 00:18:47,914
Got scared off.

00:18:47,914 --> 00:18:50,783
Well, whatever they were after
must have been important.

00:18:50,783 --> 00:18:52,952
Something that would
tell us who they are.

00:18:52,952 --> 00:18:54,454
Or where their next target is.

00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,362
His clothes are mostly
in a pile by his suitcase.

00:19:02,362 --> 00:19:04,731
I'm not sure he ever unpacked.

00:19:04,731 --> 00:19:06,666
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:13,306
Three pair of tightie-whities
means three days of travel.

00:19:13,306 --> 00:19:14,374
No suits.

00:19:14,374 --> 00:19:16,309
All his clothes are casual.

00:19:16,309 --> 00:19:18,011
Maybe a little too casual.

00:19:18,011 --> 00:19:20,680
BRODY:
I got two chargers.

00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:25,451
No electronics.

00:19:25,451 --> 00:19:27,921
No evidence the bomb
was assembled here.

00:19:31,691 --> 00:19:33,893
(thunder rumbling)

00:19:46,506 --> 00:19:48,608
I got an American passport.

00:19:48,608 --> 00:19:50,610
It's our bomber.

00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:52,679
Name's Arman Agakian.

00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:53,746
Armenian surname.

00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:58,451
SIDLE:
Huh.

00:20:00,787 --> 00:20:03,523
I got a flash drive.

00:20:03,523 --> 00:20:05,558
Guy hides a flash drive

00:20:05,558 --> 00:20:06,960
and a passport.

00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,828
We might be looking at a pro.

00:20:19,405 --> 00:20:20,406
(beeps, buzzes)

00:20:29,315 --> 00:20:30,817
Ah, Henry.

00:20:30,817 --> 00:20:32,819
You're just in time
for my demonstration.

00:20:32,819 --> 00:20:35,488
Wait, you seriously
built a bomb?

00:20:35,488 --> 00:20:36,756
I'm going back to tox.

00:20:36,756 --> 00:20:38,791
I chemically tested
the bomb frags,

00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:41,594
pieced together what I could,
then used identical components

00:20:41,594 --> 00:20:44,664
to precisely duplicate
Sara's bomb.

00:20:44,664 --> 00:20:47,367
This is disturbing
in so many ways.

00:20:47,367 --> 00:20:50,403
Why? It's just a magnetic
switch, circuit board delay,

00:20:50,403 --> 00:20:52,405
military blasting cap,
and a couple of pipes.

00:20:52,405 --> 00:20:54,273
'Kay, just to confirm,

00:20:54,273 --> 00:20:56,342
your bomb doesn't actually
contain explosives?

00:20:56,342 --> 00:20:59,412
No. It's identical to the
original complex pipe bomb,

00:20:59,412 --> 00:21:02,849
except I substituted
lightbulbs for explosives.

00:21:02,849 --> 00:21:04,384
Now, lifting this switch

00:21:04,384 --> 00:21:06,886
will duplicate the
action that Sara took

00:21:06,886 --> 00:21:09,589
when she opened up the
magnetized satchel flaps.

00:21:09,589 --> 00:21:11,991
If it's all wired correctly,
then the lightbulb should go on.

00:21:11,991 --> 00:21:14,961
For the boom, you'll just
have to use your imagination.

00:21:14,961 --> 00:21:16,963
Uh... if this does blow up,

00:21:16,963 --> 00:21:19,499
I will come back from
the dead and haunt you.

00:21:19,499 --> 00:21:21,467
This is perfectly safe.

00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:24,737
(gasps)

00:21:24,737 --> 00:21:26,506
Well, that was fascinating.

00:21:26,506 --> 00:21:29,008
I came by to give you
DNA results.

00:21:29,008 --> 00:21:30,777
Uh, no DNA off the bomb parts.

00:21:30,777 --> 00:21:33,813
Only John Doe's DNA
on the straps of the satchel.

00:21:33,813 --> 00:21:35,682
So it's back to
the drawing board.

00:21:35,682 --> 00:21:36,983
You want to help me?

00:21:36,983 --> 00:21:38,351
No, thanks.

00:21:38,351 --> 00:21:40,019
I'm testing something for Finn.

00:21:41,988 --> 00:21:43,356
(sighs)

00:21:47,026 --> 00:21:50,730
Ecklie wanted me to review
the-the Gibson case as well,

00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:52,732
because the department
and the D.A.'s office

00:21:52,732 --> 00:21:54,367
are named in the lawsuit.

00:21:54,367 --> 00:21:55,635
Sit down for a second.

00:21:57,804 --> 00:22:00,907
13 women reported seeing Ellis
outside their homes

00:22:00,907 --> 00:22:02,608
<i>over a two-month period.</i>

00:22:02,608 --> 00:22:06,279
<i>He was caught on three</i>
<i>separate security cameras.</i>

00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:08,347
He had no criminal record, yet.

00:22:08,347 --> 00:22:10,817
Although, escalation's
pretty common

00:22:10,817 --> 00:22:11,984
for voyeurs.

00:22:11,984 --> 00:22:14,287
At the trial,
a coworker testified

00:22:14,287 --> 00:22:17,423
that Ellis threatened
to get even with Claire Gibson

00:22:17,423 --> 00:22:19,425
because she had started
the whole thing

00:22:19,425 --> 00:22:21,461
by calling the police.

00:22:21,461 --> 00:22:25,398
So Ellis definitely had motive
to kill Claire Gibson.

00:22:25,398 --> 00:22:26,866
I mean, if this
happened today,

00:22:26,866 --> 00:22:29,268
Brass would be
all over him like that.

00:22:29,268 --> 00:22:30,770
That all may be true,

00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:32,905
but we've just found
uncontroverted evidence

00:22:32,905 --> 00:22:36,309
that the crowbar was moved
at the scene.

00:22:36,309 --> 00:22:39,579
Things get moved accidentally
at crime scenes all the time.

00:22:39,579 --> 00:22:41,614
Greg was the only person
in the crime scene

00:22:41,614 --> 00:22:42,715
when it happened.

00:22:42,715 --> 00:22:44,817
(sighs)

00:22:44,817 --> 00:22:46,819
All right, you know,

00:22:46,819 --> 00:22:49,489
leaving aside the fact
that we know Greg,

00:22:49,489 --> 00:22:52,925
what possible reason would
he have to frame Gus Ellis?

00:22:52,925 --> 00:22:54,327
It doesn't make
any sense.

00:22:54,327 --> 00:22:56,028
A new CSI trying
to impress his boss.

00:22:56,028 --> 00:22:58,598
No, I'm not buying that.

00:22:58,598 --> 00:23:03,035
You know, I may be the
newest CSI around here,

00:23:03,035 --> 00:23:05,505
but it's a pretty rotten job
to have to comb through

00:23:05,505 --> 00:23:07,707
all of Greg's work.

00:23:09,776 --> 00:23:12,445
I didn't choose you
because you're new, Jules,

00:23:12,445 --> 00:23:14,413
I chose you
because you've been there.

00:23:14,413 --> 00:23:16,949
You know how this
has to go.

00:23:16,949 --> 00:23:19,919
I hated you when
you investigated me.

00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,288
I don't want Greg
to feel the same.

00:23:22,288 --> 00:23:23,790
It's a search for the truth.

00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:25,792
He'll get over it,
just like you did.

00:23:25,792 --> 00:23:28,461
Now, tell me
about this crowbar.

00:23:28,461 --> 00:23:31,864
Whose was it again?

00:23:31,864 --> 00:23:33,766
Joe Gibson, Claire's brother,

00:23:33,766 --> 00:23:37,370
came over to fix a broken gutter
the morning of the murder.

00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:39,806
He left it outside,
so it's his.

00:23:39,806 --> 00:23:42,308
D.A.'s theory
was that Ellis

00:23:42,308 --> 00:23:44,977
used the crowbar
to break into the house,

00:23:44,977 --> 00:23:47,713
broke a window,
cut himself in the process.

00:23:47,713 --> 00:23:50,716
There was only one
small smear of blood found

00:23:50,716 --> 00:23:52,885
in the entire crime scene.

00:23:52,885 --> 00:23:56,355
Ellis's attorney
only has to show

00:23:56,355 --> 00:23:59,358
access and opportunity
to implicate Greg.

00:23:59,358 --> 00:24:00,827
I know.

00:24:00,827 --> 00:24:02,862
Defense attorneys are gonna
bring up this allegation

00:24:02,862 --> 00:24:04,964
every single time
he testifies.

00:24:04,964 --> 00:24:08,367
He is going to be a liability
on every case he works.

00:24:08,367 --> 00:24:11,304
His career will be over.

00:24:11,304 --> 00:24:13,039
(phone chimes)

00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,341
I got to go.

00:24:17,977 --> 00:24:20,980
FINLAY:
What'd you get?

00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,582
Can I just say this?

00:24:22,582 --> 00:24:24,951
Greg is one of the most
honest guys I know,

00:24:24,951 --> 00:24:26,485
and a great CSI.

00:24:26,485 --> 00:24:28,855
He would never intentionally
compromise a case.

00:24:34,827 --> 00:24:38,631
Uh... one microliter
per mil of EDTA

00:24:38,631 --> 00:24:41,033
was detected in the blood
from the crowbar.

00:24:41,033 --> 00:24:42,301
Blood preservative.

00:24:42,301 --> 00:24:43,836
That would be consistent

00:24:43,836 --> 00:24:46,572
with blood collected
in an EDTA tube.

00:24:46,572 --> 00:24:47,773
Thanks, Henry.

00:24:47,773 --> 00:24:49,375
But for your report,

00:24:49,375 --> 00:24:51,377
you should add that there are
trace levels of EDTA

00:24:51,377 --> 00:24:52,578
in our blood from hundreds

00:24:52,578 --> 00:24:54,947
of everyday items--
soap, mayonnaise,

00:24:54,947 --> 00:24:56,515
salad dressing, beer, milk...

00:24:56,515 --> 00:24:57,783
I get it.

00:24:57,783 --> 00:24:59,752
...soda, ointments,
detergents, breakfast...

00:24:59,752 --> 00:25:01,387
Henry, I get it.

00:25:01,387 --> 00:25:02,989
You know what? It's fine.

00:25:02,989 --> 00:25:05,491
I'll just put it
in my report.

00:25:06,792 --> 00:25:08,494
I will, too.

00:25:08,494 --> 00:25:10,763
(thunder rumbling)

00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,742
(sighs)

00:25:25,645 --> 00:25:27,380
Sanders.

00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,482
Right?

00:25:29,482 --> 00:25:31,951
She looked at you like
you were guilty of something.

00:25:31,951 --> 00:25:34,720
Excuse me?
Terri Royce,
the new chemist.

00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,888
Oh.

00:25:35,888 --> 00:25:37,590
What'd you do?

00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:39,825
Uh, nothing.
I... it's...

00:25:39,825 --> 00:25:41,961
Good heavens, spit it out.

00:25:41,961 --> 00:25:44,530
I'm being sued
for planting evidence.

00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:46,666
(laughs)
We've all been accused of that.

00:25:46,666 --> 00:25:48,601
You didn't do it, did you?

00:25:48,601 --> 00:25:50,036
No. Of course not.

00:25:50,036 --> 00:25:52,038
Good. Come in here and help me

00:25:52,038 --> 00:25:53,973
with this Armenian
bomber evidence.

00:25:56,575 --> 00:25:58,945
GCMS identified
polyunsaturated oil

00:25:58,945 --> 00:26:02,014
consistent with peanut oil
from the suspect's pants

00:26:02,014 --> 00:26:03,616
in fragments of the satchel.

00:26:03,616 --> 00:26:05,651
Take a look.

00:26:05,651 --> 00:26:08,387
SANDERS: Looks like what ends up
at the bottom of a deep fryer.

00:26:08,387 --> 00:26:10,623
I worked at a fast-food
joint in high school.

00:26:10,623 --> 00:26:12,325
Ha! Me, too.

00:26:12,325 --> 00:26:13,793
I'm from New Orleans.

00:26:13,793 --> 00:26:15,661
I didn't want to I.D.
fried food on my first day.

00:26:15,661 --> 00:26:17,363
What would y'all think?

00:26:17,363 --> 00:26:19,598
A couple of days ago,
a barrel of frying oil

00:26:19,598 --> 00:26:21,934
intended for
recycling got spilled

00:26:21,934 --> 00:26:24,537
outside the Mediterranean
and caught fire.

00:26:24,537 --> 00:26:26,872
Closed the loading
dock for hours.

00:26:26,872 --> 00:26:28,507
That would explain this.

00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,282
SANDERS:
Carbon ash?

00:26:36,282 --> 00:26:38,017
From the fire.

00:26:38,017 --> 00:26:39,685
Looks like the bomber
was hanging

00:26:39,685 --> 00:26:41,687
at the loading dock
of the Mediterranean.

00:26:41,687 --> 00:26:43,789
Which has direct access
to the flood channel.

00:26:43,789 --> 00:26:46,425
I think you just found
the bomber's target.

00:26:46,425 --> 00:26:48,728
(laughs)
All day long.

00:26:48,728 --> 00:26:50,029
(sighs)

00:26:50,029 --> 00:26:51,931
Thanks for saving
me and coming out.

00:26:51,931 --> 00:26:53,632
Hey, any day
I can be outside

00:26:53,632 --> 00:26:55,034
without my blast suit
is a good day.

00:26:55,034 --> 00:26:56,669
(chuckles)

00:26:56,669 --> 00:26:58,337
I wanted to get a
bomb expert's opinion

00:26:58,337 --> 00:26:59,705
on our guy's activities.

00:26:59,705 --> 00:27:01,474
Glad I could help.

00:27:01,474 --> 00:27:03,609
So, Arman Agakian
gets pulled out

00:27:03,609 --> 00:27:07,580
of this flood control channel
about three miles downstream,

00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,515
holding a bomb.

00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:13,319
We couldn't
get past here.

00:27:28,434 --> 00:27:30,703
This is how he got in.

00:27:30,703 --> 00:27:32,905
ANTHONY:
Yeah, but where was he headed?

00:27:37,777 --> 00:27:41,580
SIDLE: Maybe he was trying
to take a shortcut upstream

00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,349
to the other end
of the Mediterranean.

00:27:43,349 --> 00:27:45,651
I mean, no terrorist would want
to walk through the casino

00:27:45,651 --> 00:27:47,019
and be on a hundred cameras.

00:27:47,019 --> 00:27:49,955
It's way more stealth
out here, but...

00:27:49,955 --> 00:27:51,590
he didn't make it.

00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:54,260
He slipped, fell in, and
was swept downstream.

00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:55,461
Yeah, makes sense.

00:27:55,461 --> 00:27:56,762
Trace evidence we found tells us

00:27:56,762 --> 00:27:58,664
that he was
at this loading dock.

00:27:58,664 --> 00:28:01,000
I was hoping you could help me
narrow down a logical target.

00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,435
Yeah. Let's go take a look.

00:28:02,435 --> 00:28:04,870
Thanks.

00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:06,839
(people chattering)

00:28:09,975 --> 00:28:12,945
This is where
that oil fire was.

00:28:12,945 --> 00:28:16,515
For a bomb that size,
you'd need the perfect location.

00:28:16,515 --> 00:28:19,819
In Iraq, they'd put bombs
in culverts under the road.

00:28:19,819 --> 00:28:22,388
You know, out of sight,
maximum damage.

00:28:22,388 --> 00:28:24,790
Kind of like a gas main
under a casino.

00:28:28,894 --> 00:28:30,830
Thanks.

00:28:35,367 --> 00:28:37,837
A hell of
a force multiplier.

00:28:37,837 --> 00:28:40,639
Even a small charge would
kill a lot of people.

00:28:40,639 --> 00:28:43,442
SIDLE: There's a disturbance
in the dirt under this meter.

00:28:43,442 --> 00:28:45,478
Could be from a satchel.

00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:48,681
And somebody left...

00:28:48,681 --> 00:28:52,318
a little calling card
on this sharp edge.

00:28:52,318 --> 00:28:53,419
(thunder rumbling)

00:28:56,255 --> 00:28:59,892
Perfect time
for my new DNA instrument.

00:28:59,892 --> 00:29:01,393
You have a mobile lab?

00:29:01,393 --> 00:29:02,495
In the back of my car.

00:29:02,495 --> 00:29:04,597
No extractions,
quick results.

00:29:04,597 --> 00:29:05,598
You want to see it?

00:29:08,901 --> 00:29:10,002
Wow.

00:29:18,544 --> 00:29:19,478
(machine beeps)

00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,748
(beeping)

00:29:24,316 --> 00:29:25,951
(siren approaching)

00:29:25,951 --> 00:29:27,686
Blood isn't Agakian's.

00:29:27,686 --> 00:29:30,289
So someone else placed the bomb,
and Agakian removed it?

00:29:30,289 --> 00:29:31,323
(car door opens)

00:29:31,323 --> 00:29:32,758
Sara?

00:29:32,758 --> 00:29:34,927
Thought you'd
want to know.

00:29:34,927 --> 00:29:36,462
Agakian flatlined

00:29:36,462 --> 00:29:38,564
an hour ago at
the hospital.
What?

00:29:38,564 --> 00:29:39,999
He did not have
life-threatening injuries.

00:29:39,999 --> 00:29:41,834
I just saw him
with Doc Robbins.

00:29:41,834 --> 00:29:42,835
David Phillips
is picking him up.

00:29:42,835 --> 00:29:44,470
(sighs)

00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:45,538
Damn it!

00:29:51,577 --> 00:29:52,912
Uh, hi. Uh...

00:29:52,912 --> 00:29:54,813
Can I help you?

00:29:54,813 --> 00:29:57,416
Yeah. I'm from the
coroner's office.

00:29:57,416 --> 00:30:00,352
I'm here to pick up
a... Arman Agakian?

00:30:00,352 --> 00:30:01,420
No can do, pal.

00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:02,988
I have my orders.

00:30:02,988 --> 00:30:04,957
Federal orders trump yours.

00:30:04,957 --> 00:30:07,726
He's FBI property now.

00:30:19,772 --> 00:30:21,607
I went to Tovin's in Pahrump.

00:30:21,607 --> 00:30:24,610
Best baklava in Nevada.

00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:26,478
I brought you
some pastry.

00:30:26,478 --> 00:30:29,748
And I got Tovin to translate
that mystery Armenian phrase.

00:30:29,748 --> 00:30:31,917
The guy is saying "pearl royal."

00:30:31,917 --> 00:30:33,586
Sounds like the name
of a stripper.

00:30:33,586 --> 00:30:35,354
(laughs): Yeah,
it does, doesn't it?

00:30:35,354 --> 00:30:37,456
How you holding up?

00:30:37,456 --> 00:30:39,692
Just eager for this whole thing
to be over with.

00:30:39,692 --> 00:30:41,594
It's crazy, right?

00:30:41,594 --> 00:30:44,897
Everything we do
every day is scrutinized,

00:30:44,897 --> 00:30:48,901
but it's different
when it happens in front of you.

00:30:48,901 --> 00:30:50,536
In your own lab.

00:30:50,536 --> 00:30:52,738
I just wish that
I could remember more details.

00:30:52,738 --> 00:30:54,773
Greg, you've worked hundreds
of cases since then.

00:30:54,773 --> 00:30:56,775
You can't expect
to remember every detail.

00:30:56,775 --> 00:31:00,579
Yeah, but the details that
they found don't look too good.

00:31:00,579 --> 00:31:02,715
And if Finn and that

00:31:02,715 --> 00:31:05,985
expert can't exonerate me--

00:31:05,985 --> 00:31:08,754
and I mean completely--

00:31:08,754 --> 00:31:11,657
I'm through as a CSI.

00:31:13,492 --> 00:31:14,860
EDTA in the blood
from the crowbar

00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:17,563
is consistent with
the hospital blood tube.

00:31:17,563 --> 00:31:20,399
We need to nail down
Sanders' timeline.

00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:21,967
Well, I tracked his movements
through the crime scene

00:31:21,967 --> 00:31:24,470
based on the
photo data code.

00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:28,807
0617 to 0637,
Greg took 57 shots

00:31:28,807 --> 00:31:30,876
in the bedroom with the victim.

00:31:30,876 --> 00:31:33,412
Then he moved through the house,
taking a total of 45

00:31:33,412 --> 00:31:35,948
other shots encompassing
25 minutes.

00:31:35,948 --> 00:31:37,783
FINLAY:

<i>He then returned to the house.</i>

RHODES:
Four minutes later,

00:31:47,893 --> 00:31:50,329
he took the photo
showing the moved crowbar.

00:31:50,329 --> 00:31:54,733
If Sanders made a conscious
decision to frame Ellis,

00:31:54,733 --> 00:31:57,770
four minutes is
enough time to do it.

00:31:57,770 --> 00:31:59,872
All right, let's see.

00:31:59,872 --> 00:32:03,409

All with no guarantee
that he wouldn't be seen.

00:32:13,485 --> 00:32:16,021
It's possible.

00:32:16,021 --> 00:32:19,291
Who received Ellis's
reference blood at the lab?

00:32:19,291 --> 00:32:23,395
Did they note any
discrepancies in the seal?

00:32:23,395 --> 00:32:26,899
FINLAY: Uh, Wendy Simms,
the DNA analyst at the time,

00:32:26,899 --> 00:32:28,767
received the blood sealed
and initialed.

00:32:28,767 --> 00:32:30,336
It's in her notes.

00:32:30,336 --> 00:32:32,404
RHODES:
And then Sanders took

00:32:32,404 --> 00:32:34,039
the final four shots
in the bedroom,

00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:36,608
and then no more,
until the exterior shots

00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:38,944
after the scene was broken down.

00:32:38,944 --> 00:32:40,779
To document the condition
of the crime scene

00:32:40,779 --> 00:32:42,848
after the police had left,
which is protocol.

00:32:43,916 --> 00:32:45,984
Wait a second.
You see that?

00:32:47,386 --> 00:32:49,621
There's blood
on the sidewalk

00:32:49,621 --> 00:32:51,390
outside the scene.

00:32:54,426 --> 00:32:57,463
There was no blood outside
the perimeter in any of

00:32:57,463 --> 00:32:58,530
Greg's initial shots.

00:32:58,530 --> 00:32:59,965
That means someone bled

00:32:59,965 --> 00:33:02,568
outside the scene after
the perimeter was set.

00:33:02,568 --> 00:33:04,737
Gravitational drops.

Where did that blood
come from?

00:33:06,271 --> 00:33:07,840
Simms also tested

00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,776
a handkerchief
that was in Ellis's pocket

00:33:10,776 --> 00:33:12,878
when he was booked.

00:33:12,878 --> 00:33:14,980
Blood on both
was Ellis's.

00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:17,783
How did the blood get
on the handkerchief?

00:33:17,783 --> 00:33:21,387
Doctor at the hospital noted
that Ellis had no injuries.

00:33:21,387 --> 00:33:24,423
Added what looks like "Noble"
in all caps.

00:33:26,325 --> 00:33:29,695
Does Ellis look like a
handkerchief kind of guy to you?

00:33:34,333 --> 00:33:36,668
FINLAY: Amido black

Look at ridge detail.

00:33:38,737 --> 00:33:40,873
It's surprising Simms didn't
process the fingerprint

00:33:40,873 --> 00:33:42,374
in the first place.

00:33:42,374 --> 00:33:43,642
Well, there was
no context for it.

00:33:43,642 --> 00:33:45,511
The only useful evidence
would have been

00:33:45,511 --> 00:33:47,980
to find Claire Gibson's blood
on the handkerchief.

00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:49,882
Otherwise, it's just
Ellis's blood

00:33:49,882 --> 00:33:53,285
on Ellis's handkerchief
in Ellis's pants, so...

00:33:53,285 --> 00:33:55,487
wouldn't have been
a big deal.

Major Incident Log.

from March 21, 2006?

00:34:23,015 --> 00:34:24,616
Sure.

00:34:24,616 --> 00:34:26,885
I remember everything.
It was my first murder scene.

00:34:26,885 --> 00:34:28,887
I was a Police Explorer
back then.

00:34:28,887 --> 00:34:31,557
Your handkerchief was found
inside Gus Ellis's pocket.

00:34:31,557 --> 00:34:34,426
He was the suspect at the time.
Can you explain that?

00:34:34,426 --> 00:34:37,563
Yeah. I was waiting on a radio
car to take him to the hospital

00:34:37,563 --> 00:34:39,932

or something.

00:34:39,932 --> 00:34:42,935

00:36:30,876 --> 00:36:32,578
Still doesn't work.

00:36:32,578 --> 00:36:34,446
Then the circuit
isn't the problem.

00:36:34,446 --> 00:36:35,781
Let me see.

00:36:35,781 --> 00:36:38,884
Blasting caps creep me out.

00:36:38,884 --> 00:36:40,786
I remember a public service film

00:36:40,786 --> 00:36:43,422
in grammar school taught
kids not to play with them.

00:36:43,422 --> 00:36:44,890
Showed a kid who
bit down on one.

00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:46,458
Ugh!
Yeah.

00:36:46,458 --> 00:36:49,328
Made a big impression on him.
And me.

00:36:49,328 --> 00:36:50,929
Just... (imitates explosion)

00:36:54,299 --> 00:36:57,302
That blasting cap
completely fragmented.

00:36:57,302 --> 00:36:58,937
Why is this one still intact?

00:36:58,937 --> 00:37:00,572
There's white powder
still inside.

00:37:00,572 --> 00:37:02,341
I mean, shouldn't
the explosive be brown?

00:37:02,341 --> 00:37:05,510
RDX and PETN are both white.

00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:07,379
But this should have been
completely consumed

00:37:07,379 --> 00:37:08,480
in the controlled blast.

00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,416
Yeah, we should test it.

00:37:12,517 --> 00:37:15,287
By "we," you mean me?

00:37:15,287 --> 00:37:16,922
Primary explosives are
friction-sensitive

00:37:16,922 --> 00:37:18,724
and flammable;
it's more up your alley.

00:37:18,724 --> 00:37:21,360
I'm a body fluid guy.
Not touching that.

00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:34,339
Powder should burn
when exposed to flame.

00:37:44,916 --> 00:37:46,518
ANDREWS:
Well, there's the problem.

00:37:46,518 --> 00:37:48,387
That white stuff
isn't explosive.

00:37:48,387 --> 00:37:50,722
That bomb was never intended
to go off.

00:37:55,594 --> 00:37:57,362
How's it going?

00:37:57,362 --> 00:37:59,831
God, I have tried
everything I can think of.

00:37:59,831 --> 00:38:01,600
Anything that we found
in the hotel room,

00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,335
anything that
he was hiding,

00:38:03,335 --> 00:38:05,404
anything we know about Agakian--
none of it's working.

00:38:05,404 --> 00:38:06,838
I just... I can't
figure out

00:38:06,838 --> 00:38:08,940
the pass code
to this flash drive.

00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:11,810
Have you tried the info
from that bogus AFIS hit?

00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:13,645
Everything I can think of.

00:38:13,645 --> 00:38:16,448
What about... the fake address?

00:38:17,716 --> 00:38:19,551
What was it again?

00:38:19,551 --> 00:38:22,587
473 Snowdrift Lane.

00:38:24,456 --> 00:38:26,324
(computer trilling)

00:38:30,328 --> 00:38:32,264
Look at the intersection
that's highlighted.

00:38:35,467 --> 00:38:37,803
We cracked the password
on that flash drive.

00:38:37,803 --> 00:38:41,406
But it looks like
I'm a little late.

00:38:41,406 --> 00:38:43,475
CSI Sidle.
Sara, this is

00:38:43,475 --> 00:38:46,545
Ben Parker,
special agent, FBI.

00:38:46,545 --> 00:38:47,979
We'll need
to take that flash drive.

00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,521
Cut your arm
on a gas meter cage?

00:38:59,491 --> 00:39:01,526
You're here about Arman Agakian.

00:39:01,526 --> 00:39:03,662
Although, I'm sure
that's not his real name.

00:39:03,662 --> 00:39:06,364
He's probably
not dead, either.

00:39:06,364 --> 00:39:07,632
Agakian's FBI, Sara.

00:39:07,632 --> 00:39:08,934
He's been working

00:39:08,934 --> 00:39:10,802
undercover
for the last couple years

00:39:10,802 --> 00:39:13,438
to infiltrate the Armenian mob.

00:39:13,438 --> 00:39:15,741
They've been extorting money
from The Mediterranean.

00:39:15,741 --> 00:39:17,676
He posed
as an explosives specialist.

00:39:17,676 --> 00:39:18,810
Last night was his big drop.

00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:21,346
You gave him two dud bombs

00:39:21,346 --> 00:39:23,548
that seemed very real

00:39:23,548 --> 00:39:25,717
<i>to plant at The Mediterranean.</i>

00:39:25,717 --> 00:39:28,553
(thunder rumbling)

00:39:30,055 --> 00:39:33,358
<i>He planted the first one.</i>

00:39:33,358 --> 00:39:34,793
<i>When he went</i>
<i>to plant the second one...</i>

00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:41,566
<i>...he slipped into the flood</i>
<i>channel and got washed away.</i>

00:39:47,539 --> 00:39:49,641
After that,
we had to abort the op.

00:39:49,641 --> 00:39:51,343
We picked up the bomb
at the loading dock.

00:39:51,343 --> 00:39:53,912
Scratching your agent's arm
in the process.

00:39:53,912 --> 00:39:56,681
How does planting dud bombs
help your undercover op?

00:39:56,681 --> 00:39:59,417
We planned to discover the bombs
very publicly first,

00:39:59,417 --> 00:40:01,453
then release to the media
that they were very dangerous

00:40:01,453 --> 00:40:02,954
and expertly made.

00:40:02,954 --> 00:40:04,723
Fooling the Armenians and
establishing your agent

00:40:04,723 --> 00:40:07,259
as an explosives expert.

00:40:07,259 --> 00:40:09,261
What about the
intersection

00:40:09,261 --> 00:40:11,463
of Pearl Street and
Royal Avenue in North Vegas?

00:40:11,463 --> 00:40:13,365
What was that about?

00:40:13,365 --> 00:40:16,501
That's where our undercover
met his Armenian contact.

00:40:16,501 --> 00:40:18,770
Probably why Pearl-Royal stuck
in his mind.

00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:21,840
And the extortion plot--
has that been aborted as well?

00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,375
Our undercover
was able to identify

00:40:23,375 --> 00:40:24,743
the individuals responsible.

00:40:24,743 --> 00:40:25,977
We're arresting them
right now.

00:40:25,977 --> 00:40:27,412
Good.

00:40:27,412 --> 00:40:28,747
Parker's men are gonna need

00:40:28,747 --> 00:40:30,415
to take custody
of all the evidence.

00:40:30,415 --> 00:40:32,350
Of course.

00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:35,453
If we're square here, I need
to speak to Captain Jim Brass.

00:40:35,453 --> 00:40:37,622
Sounds like a good idea.

00:40:40,759 --> 00:40:42,894
WOMAN:
<i>Federal agents descended</i>

00:40:42,894 --> 00:40:44,963
on the Mediterranean Casino
today,

00:40:44,963 --> 00:40:47,966
<i>taking five Armenian nationals</i>
<i>into custody.</i>

00:40:47,966 --> 00:40:51,369
<i>The individuals arrested</i>
<i>are suspected to be members</i>

00:40:51,369 --> 00:40:53,872
<i>of an Armenian</i>
<i>organized crime ring.</i>

00:40:53,872 --> 00:40:55,473
Our lawyers scheduled
a deposition

00:40:55,473 --> 00:40:57,342
with Langer
for next week.

00:40:57,342 --> 00:41:00,846
Unsure how it's gonna turn out,
but Sanders is off the hook.

00:41:00,846 --> 00:41:02,547
I'm glad.

00:41:02,547 --> 00:41:05,317
Well, no offense, but I hope
the next time I see you

00:41:05,317 --> 00:41:07,319
will be at an American
Academy meeting.

00:41:07,319 --> 00:41:09,054
(laughs)

00:41:11,289 --> 00:41:12,991
See you later.

00:41:12,991 --> 00:41:15,594
Thank you.

00:41:16,695 --> 00:41:18,697
Hey.
Hey.

00:41:18,697 --> 00:41:19,698
Talked to Greg.

00:41:19,698 --> 00:41:20,732
How's he doing?

00:41:20,732 --> 00:41:22,734
Look, I guess I get

00:41:22,734 --> 00:41:25,637
why you thought you had to
treat him the way that you did,

00:41:25,637 --> 00:41:27,973
but it's tough to be on
the receiving end of that.

00:41:27,973 --> 00:41:29,674
Yeah, I know.

00:41:29,674 --> 00:41:31,810
I had an I.A. investigation
in Seattle,

00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:34,779
and Russell treated me
the exact same way.

00:41:35,747 --> 00:41:37,849
Still not over it.

00:41:39,985 --> 00:41:41,920
Greg's in the locker room.

00:41:51,496 --> 00:41:53,465
Hey. Congratulations.

00:41:53,465 --> 00:41:56,301
Thanks.

00:41:56,301 --> 00:41:58,470
I know I was really hard on you.

00:41:58,470 --> 00:42:00,038
I was trying to do my best

00:42:00,038 --> 00:42:02,374
for someone
that I really do care about,

00:42:02,374 --> 00:42:04,843
but I couldn't act like it.

00:42:04,843 --> 00:42:06,378
I had to seem impartial,

00:42:06,378 --> 00:42:08,380
or it really would have
hurt your case.

00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:10,649
Hey, I understand.

00:42:12,484 --> 00:42:15,053
Greg, I never thought
you did anything wrong.

00:42:18,456 --> 00:42:20,358
How about that grilled cheese
at RJ's?

00:42:20,358 --> 00:42:23,695
That sounds great.

00:42:23,695 --> 00:42:24,963
My treat?

00:42:24,963 --> 00:42:26,431
Okay.
