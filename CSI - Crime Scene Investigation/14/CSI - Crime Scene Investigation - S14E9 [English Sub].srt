00:00:10,021 --> 00:00:11,956
(TV playing, man speaking
indistinctly)

00:00:17,157 --> 00:00:19,014
(motorcycle revs in distance,
phone line rings)

00:00:19,014 --> 00:00:21,082
WOMAN: <i>911 operator.</i>
<i>What's your emergency?</i>

00:00:21,082 --> 00:00:22,984
(siren wails)
MAN:
<i>I'm at the Sky View Motel.</i>

00:00:22,984 --> 00:00:25,687
<i>I was making a delivery.</i>
<i>You have to send someone.</i>

00:00:25,687 --> 00:00:27,689
<i>I think they're dead.</i>
<i>I don't know for sure, but...</i>
<i>Slow down, sir.</i>

00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:28,757
<i>You need to tell me</i>
<i>what happened.</i>

00:00:28,757 --> 00:00:30,625
<i>Are there people injured?</i>

00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:31,927
MAN: <i>There's blood.</i>
<i>There's blood everywhere.</i>

00:00:31,927 --> 00:00:34,029
(siren chirps)

00:00:34,029 --> 00:00:35,997
(sighs wearily)
Well, it's a messy one.

00:00:35,997 --> 00:00:37,520
If you don't believe me,
ask the pizza

00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,656
delivery guy there.
STOKES:
Yeah, is he the one

00:00:39,656 --> 00:00:41,658
who called it in?
Yeah, he was
delivering pizzas

00:00:41,658 --> 00:00:44,060
to, uh, one of
the rooms nearby.

00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,729
The door to 114 was ajar,
so he looked in.

00:00:46,729 --> 00:00:49,032
What do we have?
Two victims.

00:00:49,032 --> 00:00:51,467
Mr. and Mrs. Smith.
Oh, that's original.

00:00:51,467 --> 00:00:52,735
Anybody know
who they really are?

00:00:52,735 --> 00:00:53,811
No.

00:00:53,811 --> 00:00:55,713
And I don't know what
they did to deserve this.

00:01:10,762 --> 00:01:14,666
PHILLIPS:
...63... 64... 65...

00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:17,101
66, 67...

00:01:17,101 --> 00:01:21,105
68... 69... 70...

00:01:21,105 --> 00:01:22,807
71, 72...
STOKES:
Talk to me, David.

00:01:22,807 --> 00:01:26,644
I'm trying to determine
the number of stab wounds.

00:01:26,644 --> 00:01:28,980
But, frankly, there are
just too many to count.

00:01:31,015 --> 00:01:32,517
FINLAY:
This is disturbing.

00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,622
STOKES:
Hey, wait a minute.

00:01:37,622 --> 00:01:40,024
You know something?
I've been here.

00:01:40,024 --> 00:01:43,127
Yeah, we had that OD out
on the street a while back.
Yeah, yeah,

00:01:43,127 --> 00:01:45,697
in the motel, but I mean,
in this room--this exact one.

00:01:45,697 --> 00:01:46,998
I-I've been here.

00:01:46,998 --> 00:01:49,534
Room 114.

00:01:49,534 --> 00:01:51,769
I remember the view of the neon
from that window.

00:01:51,769 --> 00:01:54,038
This is it.
You're right.

00:01:54,038 --> 00:01:56,641
We have been here before.
Yeah, it was

00:01:56,641 --> 00:01:59,043
a dismemberment murder;
victim was in his 20s.

00:01:59,043 --> 00:02:01,479
It was about, uh,
two months ago.
No, I think it was more recent.

00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:04,382
It was another couple,
but the woman was bludgeoned...

00:02:04,382 --> 00:02:05,683
in her sleep.

00:02:05,683 --> 00:02:07,585
I am pretty sure
it was the dismemberment.

00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:09,020
I'm sorry,
but-but you're both right.

00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,788
I've been here twice before,

00:02:10,788 --> 00:02:13,825
once for the dismemberment
and again for the couple.

00:02:13,825 --> 00:02:15,860
And now this.

00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:19,063
Anybody else getting a really
bad feeling about this place?

00:02:19,063 --> 00:02:22,934
Yeah... yeah, this the world's
most unlucky motel room.

00:02:32,677 --> 00:02:35,780

(indistinct radio communication,
siren wailing in distance)

00:03:14,452 --> 00:03:16,854
All right,
that's three murder scenes

00:03:16,854 --> 00:03:18,690
all in the same spot.

00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,558
They got to be related,
don't you think?

00:03:20,558 --> 00:03:23,394
Maybe there's a connection
between the victims

00:03:23,394 --> 00:03:26,064
or the killer has
a weird fixation of some kind.

00:03:26,064 --> 00:03:29,767
I don't think I'm ready to talk
about past crimes yet.

00:03:29,767 --> 00:03:31,869
Have to focus on
this one first.

00:03:31,869 --> 00:03:33,438
Yeah, I hear you.

00:03:33,438 --> 00:03:35,139
I'll take the bathroom.

00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:05,036
(man yelling, blade slicing)

00:04:24,122 --> 00:04:25,590
(woman screams)

00:04:27,525 --> 00:04:29,927
(woman screaming)

00:04:34,465 --> 00:04:36,768
BRASS: So, how long have
you been manager here?

00:04:36,768 --> 00:04:39,036
Uh, since about the time
I learned to walk.

00:04:39,036 --> 00:04:41,372
My parents built this place,
so... I grew up here.

00:04:41,372 --> 00:04:42,373
Oh!
Yeah.

00:04:42,373 --> 00:04:43,708
All mine now.

00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:45,510
Do you have any idea
who might've done this?

00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:48,546
Isn't that your business
to figure that out?

00:04:48,546 --> 00:04:49,847
I mean, I know we're
not the Bellagio, but...

00:04:49,847 --> 00:04:52,583
if I have to drop
the rates any lower,

00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,051
I might as well just
board the place up.

00:04:54,051 --> 00:04:57,588
Yeah. So, you got about, what,
uh, 20 rooms here?

00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:59,857
Tell me about the people
who stay in them.

00:04:59,857 --> 00:05:01,659
It's like the sign says.
I mean, by the night,

00:05:01,659 --> 00:05:03,628
by the week and by the month.

00:05:03,628 --> 00:05:04,929
I'm gonna need a list of names.

00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:06,731
Well, that could be a problem.

00:05:06,731 --> 00:05:07,899
Not that I wouldn't
give it, it's just...

00:05:07,899 --> 00:05:08,833
I don't have it.

00:05:09,801 --> 00:05:11,402
Come on, man.

00:05:11,402 --> 00:05:13,638
The place is 39 bucks a night.

00:05:13,638 --> 00:05:15,072
If people have cash,

00:05:15,072 --> 00:05:16,874
what do I care
about their names?

00:05:16,874 --> 00:05:20,411
Look, none of 'em are
killers, though-- trust me.

00:05:20,411 --> 00:05:22,847
How do you know that?

00:05:22,847 --> 00:05:25,683
Well, there's no one here
that interesting.

00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:46,904
(liquid sloshing)

00:06:07,058 --> 00:06:09,827
Hey, Finn!

00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:11,796
Looks like the Smiths had
a guest last night.

00:06:11,796 --> 00:06:14,799
The towels are damp, and I found
a red hair in the shower drain.

00:06:14,799 --> 00:06:17,001
Hmm, that doesn't match either
of our victims.

00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:19,370
And there were three
toothbrushes around the sink.

00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,539
Uh, I found
a receipt for one.

00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:23,474
It's from the drugstore around
the corner--last night.

00:06:23,474 --> 00:06:25,076
So a guest they didn't plan on.

00:06:25,076 --> 00:06:27,144
There's more.
They also bought shampoo

00:06:27,144 --> 00:06:28,613
and a pair of scissors,

00:06:28,613 --> 00:06:31,148
which have since disappeared.

00:06:31,148 --> 00:06:33,718
Could be the murder weapon.

00:06:33,718 --> 00:06:36,587
So there was someone in here
before the killing started.
Yeah, who showered

00:06:36,587 --> 00:06:38,956
and-- I don't know-- judging
from the toothbrush,

00:06:38,956 --> 00:06:40,791
might've been planning
on staying the night.

00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:41,759
So what went wrong?

00:06:52,003 --> 00:06:53,838
I've been doing this
long enough that nothing

00:06:53,838 --> 00:06:55,473
shocks me,
but if a case could...

00:06:57,608 --> 00:07:00,912
Just the sheer savagery
involved.

00:07:00,912 --> 00:07:02,747
More than a hundred stab wounds
in each victim.

00:07:02,747 --> 00:07:05,383
Certainly beyond
what was necessary...

00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:07,985
if the goal was
to simply kill them.

00:07:07,985 --> 00:07:09,520
Can I see that?

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,689
It's, uh, way beyond
what we sometimes see

00:07:11,689 --> 00:07:13,891
with crimes of passion
or extreme anger.

00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:14,959
This was madness.

00:07:17,361 --> 00:07:18,763
RUSSELL: Their names
really were Smith.

00:07:18,763 --> 00:07:20,364
ROBBINS:
Richard and Ann.

00:07:20,364 --> 00:07:22,667
According to family,
they were in from Flagstaff

00:07:22,667 --> 00:07:25,503
for an antique toy
and collectibles convention.

00:07:25,503 --> 00:07:27,605
That would explain
the dolls in the room.

00:07:27,605 --> 00:07:29,640
Sounds like they were
solid people.

00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:33,744
She volunteered, ran pet therapy
at an old folks home.

00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:35,146
He worked with the homeless.

00:07:36,814 --> 00:07:38,449
Squeaky clean.

00:07:38,449 --> 00:07:40,117
Course, that wouldn't be
the first time the...

00:07:40,117 --> 00:07:43,754
squeaky-clean have indulged
their dark side here in Vegas.

00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:45,456
They could've invited
somebody back to the room,

00:07:45,456 --> 00:07:46,891
spice up their life
a little bit.

00:07:48,659 --> 00:07:50,661
If so...

00:07:50,661 --> 00:07:53,898
certainly got more
than they bargained for.

00:07:53,898 --> 00:07:57,668
Hey. So, I... pulled the files

00:07:57,668 --> 00:07:59,837
for the other two
motel murder scenes.

00:07:59,837 --> 00:08:01,138
It's weird, don't you think?

00:08:01,138 --> 00:08:03,140
That a killer would fixate
on one room?

00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,775
What do you think
the significance is?

00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:05,876
Why does he feel
the need to kill there?

00:08:05,876 --> 00:08:07,445
Well, that's assuming

00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,747
that these are all the work
of one killer.

00:08:09,747 --> 00:08:11,615
It could be
that there's no connection.

00:08:11,615 --> 00:08:14,151
That you're looking for patterns
where there are none.

00:08:14,151 --> 00:08:16,954
So it's a coincidence that three
totally unrelated killers

00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:18,789
chose this one room?

00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:20,658
I'm just saying,
we don't know yet.

00:08:20,658 --> 00:08:22,893
All right,

00:08:22,893 --> 00:08:24,528
first one: Mark Bell.

00:08:24,528 --> 00:08:25,963
11 weeks ago,
he stayed

00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:29,567
in Room 114 after his girlfriend
kicked him out.

00:08:29,567 --> 00:08:31,635
Yeah, I remember.
I worked this case with Finn.

00:08:31,635 --> 00:08:34,005
The maid found him tied
to the bed,

00:08:34,005 --> 00:08:37,141
<i>severe lacerations to his legs.</i>
<i>They were nearly cut off.</i>

00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:38,909
<i>He bled to death.</i>

00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:40,678
<i>There was a bloody knife</i>
<i>found on the floor.</i>

00:08:40,678 --> 00:08:42,480
<i>Too smeared to yield</i>
<i>any viable prints.</i>

00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,582
<i>Detectives, at the time,</i>

00:08:44,582 --> 00:08:46,684
<i>thought the attack was related</i>
<i>to a drug debt.</i>
(screaming)

00:08:46,684 --> 00:08:49,153
<i>They thought the dealer</i>
<i>was sending a message.</i>

00:08:50,588 --> 00:08:53,457
Four weeks ago...

00:08:53,457 --> 00:08:54,992
second attack
in the room.

00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:56,894
Alex and Tina Garnez.

00:08:56,894 --> 00:08:59,096
Nick and I
handled this one.

00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:03,134
<i>Their house</i>
<i>had been foreclosed on.</i>

00:09:03,134 --> 00:09:05,503
<i>They were living in their car</i>
<i>for months.</i>

00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:08,406
<i>Mr. Garnez finally got a job.</i>

00:09:08,406 --> 00:09:11,142
<i>Moving to the motel was</i>
<i>supposed to be a step up.</i>

00:09:11,142 --> 00:09:14,612
<i>That night, he was sneaking</i>
<i>a cigarette in the bathroom</i>

00:09:14,612 --> 00:09:16,614
<i>while his wife slept.</i>

00:09:16,614 --> 00:09:18,516
<i>The killer started</i>
<i>with his wife...</i>

00:09:21,552 --> 00:09:24,155
<i>...clubbing her</i>
<i>while she was sleeping.</i>

00:09:24,155 --> 00:09:26,757
<i>Then he must've surprised</i>
<i>Mr. Garnez in the bathroom...</i>

00:09:26,757 --> 00:09:28,459
No!

00:09:28,459 --> 00:09:30,027
<i>Overpowered him.</i>

00:09:32,129 --> 00:09:34,365
He survived.

00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,534
He's still in the hospital
recovering.

00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,069
And then last night...

00:09:38,069 --> 00:09:39,070
the Smiths.

00:09:41,605 --> 00:09:43,874
(sighs)
Still think we're...

00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:46,143
dealing with random,
unrelated events?

00:09:46,143 --> 00:09:48,012
STOKES:
<i>All right, Finn,</i>

00:09:48,012 --> 00:09:49,980
I'll see you back at the lab.

00:09:54,085 --> 00:09:56,020
(helicopter hovering)

00:10:07,832 --> 00:10:10,701
Come on now. Open up.
I saw you in there.

00:10:11,769 --> 00:10:13,037
Hey.

00:10:13,037 --> 00:10:15,039
I was asleep last night.

00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:17,374
I was not involved.
I already told the cops.

00:10:17,374 --> 00:10:19,643
Oh, yeah, yeah. That's cool.
I'm not, uh...

00:10:19,643 --> 00:10:21,378
I'm not here to grill you.
(chuckles)

00:10:21,378 --> 00:10:24,682
Kind of looks like you like
to call this place home.

00:10:24,682 --> 00:10:26,817
I'm guessing you see everything
that goes on in here.

00:10:26,817 --> 00:10:28,652
You... didn't see
anything weird?

00:10:28,652 --> 00:10:30,888
Anybody suspicious
running around here lately?

00:10:30,888 --> 00:10:33,791
It's not my place to judge
another man in that way.

00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:35,659
Only God can judge.

00:10:35,659 --> 00:10:37,761
Right... well,
God would want you

00:10:37,761 --> 00:10:39,697
to help me catch a
killer, wouldn't he?

00:10:39,697 --> 00:10:41,098
I'm sorry.

00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:43,434
Now, sir, please, please,
hey, come on, now.

00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:46,804
A couple was violently
murdered last night.

00:10:46,804 --> 00:10:49,807
A woman a few weeks ago.
A young man before that.

00:10:49,807 --> 00:10:52,143
All in the same room,
all innocent victims.

00:10:52,143 --> 00:10:55,746
Innocent? There's no one
on this planet who's innocent.

00:10:57,047 --> 00:10:58,682
We're all sinners.

00:10:58,682 --> 00:11:00,985
Yeah, yeah, well, that-that

00:11:00,985 --> 00:11:02,553
doesn't really
help me do my job.

00:11:02,553 --> 00:11:04,421
They were called to God.

00:11:04,421 --> 00:11:05,756
That's God's plan.

00:11:07,091 --> 00:11:08,592
Your job is done.

00:11:08,592 --> 00:11:10,027
Yeah, I just...

00:11:13,497 --> 00:11:16,367
Might be my biggest
regret about this job--

00:11:16,367 --> 00:11:19,937
I know way too much
about hotel bedspreads.

00:11:19,937 --> 00:11:22,840
And hotel carpets.
Don't go barefoot.
So, we have

00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,742
three different bedspreads
from our...

00:11:24,742 --> 00:11:25,943
three different
crime scenes.

00:11:25,943 --> 00:11:27,111
I ran the DNA.

00:11:27,111 --> 00:11:28,779
The bedspread
on the left is

00:11:28,779 --> 00:11:30,981
from the very first
murder scene.
I'm guessing

00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:33,150
it lived in that room
for who knows how long.

00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,085
Long enough that I
was able to identify

00:11:35,085 --> 00:11:37,488
26 individual
DNA profiles.

00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:38,822
Whoa.
Yeah. The replacement

00:11:38,822 --> 00:11:41,158
bedspread there was
only in the room

00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,927
for seven weeks.
So fewer contributions.

00:11:42,927 --> 00:11:44,695
16 of them.

00:11:44,695 --> 00:11:47,698
And the third bedspread,
from last night's crime scene.

00:11:47,698 --> 00:11:49,567
Yielded only
nine contributors.

00:11:49,567 --> 00:11:51,869
But here's the thing:
One of them, a male,

00:11:51,869 --> 00:11:55,105
is common
to all three bedspreads.

00:11:55,105 --> 00:11:57,741
One person,
the same person was in the room

00:11:57,741 --> 00:11:59,109
before each of the murders?

00:12:00,611 --> 00:12:02,012
Have you run the samples
through CODIS?

00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:03,113
It's running
right now.

00:12:05,849 --> 00:12:08,152
Here we go.

00:12:08,152 --> 00:12:10,754
Randall Wicks, 22.
He must have

00:12:10,754 --> 00:12:12,523
just been added
to the system.

00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:15,559
There's why-- sexual battery
charge two weeks ago.

00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:16,994
Look where he was arrested.

00:12:18,662 --> 00:12:20,998
That same motel.
The same room!

00:12:20,998 --> 00:12:23,000
I'll call Brass,

00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,702
get out a broadcast.

00:12:30,941 --> 00:12:32,776
Oh, how the mighty have
fallen, huh, Randall?

00:12:32,776 --> 00:12:35,546
You used to be
the featured dancer
in the Tangiers

00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:36,847
All Male Review.

00:12:36,847 --> 00:12:38,582
How'd you let that
gig slip away?

00:12:38,582 --> 00:12:39,683
I don't know.

00:12:39,683 --> 00:12:41,719
I got bored, so I quit.

00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:44,755
Well, or maybe you
found something more
interesting to do, huh?

00:12:47,858 --> 00:12:50,127
Oh, hey, man, what the hell?
SANDERS: Three
separate murders

00:12:50,127 --> 00:12:52,496
in the same room at
the Sky View Motel.

00:12:52,496 --> 00:12:56,767
Your DNA was found in the room
after each of the crimes.

00:12:56,767 --> 00:13:00,571
What? Wait a minute--
Sky View Motel?

00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,506
Was that in room 114?

00:13:02,506 --> 00:13:04,642
I use that room,
frequently.

00:13:04,642 --> 00:13:05,776
For business.

00:13:05,776 --> 00:13:08,646
So... you're
a prostitute?

00:13:08,646 --> 00:13:11,448
Dude, I'm a stud,
letting frustrated housewives

00:13:11,448 --> 00:13:14,518
get a taste of something
they wouldn't even get
close to otherwise.

00:13:14,518 --> 00:13:17,454
Okay, stud, what
about the housewife
you beat up in room 114?

00:13:17,454 --> 00:13:19,156
The sexual
battery charge.

00:13:19,156 --> 00:13:21,425
Or was that just part of
the pony ride experience?

00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:23,394
That was self-defense.

00:13:23,394 --> 00:13:24,528
I'm serious.

00:13:24,528 --> 00:13:27,531
I was in fear for my life.

00:13:27,531 --> 00:13:28,899
Okay...

00:13:28,899 --> 00:13:30,901
I meet this woman there, right?

00:13:30,901 --> 00:13:33,003
Totally normal at first.

00:13:33,003 --> 00:13:35,072
Then we start
getting into it, and...

00:13:35,072 --> 00:13:37,541
I don't know,
she goes all crazy.

00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:39,543
Starts hallucinating
or something,

00:13:39,543 --> 00:13:40,878
screaming at the walls.

00:13:40,878 --> 00:13:43,147
Pure freak show.
SANDERS:
And why?

00:13:43,147 --> 00:13:45,382
What would make
her do that?

00:13:45,382 --> 00:13:47,551
Well, I ain't a doctor
or nothing, but...

00:13:47,551 --> 00:13:49,753
must be the sex
just blew her mind.

00:13:50,988 --> 00:13:52,823
Yeah, that must
have been it.

00:13:52,823 --> 00:13:55,492
(sighs): Well...
aside from being

00:13:55,492 --> 00:13:57,661
a complete tool,
what do you think?

00:13:57,661 --> 00:13:59,697
Well, he still
could be our killer.
Well, the problem is,

00:13:59,697 --> 00:14:01,565
all we have is DNA evidence,

00:14:01,565 --> 00:14:04,835
and we can't disprove his story
of how it got in that room.

00:14:04,835 --> 00:14:08,405
Well, we do have an eyewitness
who could possibly I.D. Randall.

00:14:08,405 --> 00:14:09,673
Alex Garnez, the husband

00:14:09,673 --> 00:14:11,575
who survived his wife
being bludgeoned

00:14:11,575 --> 00:14:13,911
four weeks ago.
He has massive head injuries.

00:14:13,911 --> 00:14:16,680
He's still in the hospital--
we don't even know what
condition he's in.

00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,981
Well, I talked to his doctor.

00:14:17,981 --> 00:14:20,384
She said he's struggling
psychologically.

00:14:20,384 --> 00:14:22,720
They have him on suicide watch
after one failed attempt,

00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,822
but... physically...

00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:27,558
she said he's strong
enough to talk to us.

00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:38,902
Mr. Garnez.

00:14:38,902 --> 00:14:40,637
Um...

00:14:40,637 --> 00:14:42,539
I'm CSI Brody,

00:14:42,539 --> 00:14:44,408
and this is

00:14:44,408 --> 00:14:45,743
CSI Sanders.

00:14:45,743 --> 00:14:48,545
I'm sorry,
but we need to talk to you

00:14:48,545 --> 00:14:51,048
about the night that
you and your wife were attacked.

00:14:53,117 --> 00:14:55,552
How much do you remember?

00:14:57,421 --> 00:15:00,057
(panting)

00:15:00,057 --> 00:15:01,725
I don't know.

00:15:01,725 --> 00:15:04,128
I... I...

00:15:04,128 --> 00:15:06,930
I remember her just lying there,

00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:10,134
just lying there.

00:15:10,134 --> 00:15:13,670
And all the...
blood around her...

00:15:17,608 --> 00:15:20,511
We were high school sweethearts.

00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:26,717
Did you see the person
who hurt you and your wife?

00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,754
Do you remember his face?

00:15:31,922 --> 00:15:35,125
(woman's faint, distorted cries)

00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:37,361
I can see him...

00:15:37,361 --> 00:15:40,097
standing over her,

00:15:40,097 --> 00:15:41,899
hitting her over...

00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:44,468
and over...

00:15:44,468 --> 00:15:46,804
and...

00:15:46,804 --> 00:15:48,372
and I'm powerless.

00:15:48,372 --> 00:15:51,575
I... I can't stop him.

00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:53,911
Like there's a wall
between us. I...

00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:57,648
Yet I can still hear the
sickening sound of...

00:15:57,648 --> 00:15:59,450
blow...

00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:01,051
after blow.

00:16:01,051 --> 00:16:03,020
Mr. Garnez...

00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,923
we want to... we want
to show you some photographs

00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,891
of some faces.

00:16:07,891 --> 00:16:10,494
We need you to tell us
if any one of these men

00:16:10,494 --> 00:16:13,564
looks like the man that
we've been talking about, okay?

00:16:18,068 --> 00:16:19,803
He's not there.

00:16:19,803 --> 00:16:21,472
Are you sure?

00:16:23,407 --> 00:16:24,942
None of these...

00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:28,078
is the man that
killed my Tina.

00:16:30,414 --> 00:16:33,684
Hodges, you texted me "911"?

00:16:33,684 --> 00:16:34,952
I did.

00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,787
What is the 911?

00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:39,022
Sorry. Your suspect.

00:16:39,022 --> 00:16:41,391
He ran from the motel
room barefoot, correct?

00:16:41,391 --> 00:16:42,426
Mm-hmm.

00:16:42,426 --> 00:16:43,727
Yet he left no shoes behind.

00:16:43,727 --> 00:16:45,362
He could have been
carrying his shoes.

00:16:45,362 --> 00:16:47,798
He was in too much
of a hurry to put them on.

00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:50,434
Mm, maybe. But there
was a bottle of shampoo

00:16:50,434 --> 00:16:51,902
that Nick found
in the bathroom.

00:16:51,902 --> 00:16:54,037
It contained
one percent permethrin,

00:16:54,037 --> 00:16:56,373
formulated to
combat head lice.

00:16:56,373 --> 00:16:57,841
Now, I've checked with Doc.

00:16:57,841 --> 00:17:00,444
Neither of the Smiths
were head lice sufferers.

00:17:00,444 --> 00:17:01,912
So the shampoo
was for the guest.

00:17:01,912 --> 00:17:04,448
Yes. Presumably the killer.

00:17:04,448 --> 00:17:06,116
Nick found residue on
the wall of the shower.

00:17:06,116 --> 00:17:09,553
I've tested it; it contained
<i>five</i> percent permethrin.

00:17:09,553 --> 00:17:11,555
Permethrin, for the head lice.
No.

00:17:11,555 --> 00:17:13,857
This is five percent,
in a body cream.

00:17:13,857 --> 00:17:16,960
It's prescription strength,
used to treat scabies.

00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,663
I don't want to seem
insensitive, but...

00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:21,365
shoeless, head lice,

00:17:21,365 --> 00:17:24,368
and scabies--that all
sounds like homeless to me.

00:17:24,368 --> 00:17:26,136
Richard Smith worked
with the homeless

00:17:26,136 --> 00:17:28,138
back in Flagstaff.

00:17:28,138 --> 00:17:31,141
He could have been doing
some sort of outreach,
wanted to help somebody,

00:17:31,141 --> 00:17:32,809
brought them in
off the street.

00:17:32,809 --> 00:17:34,511
I've already called around.

00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:36,013
There's a local shelter
called Street Saviors

00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:37,881
who had a scabies
outbreak last week,

00:17:37,881 --> 00:17:40,951
where they distributed this
very same prescription cream.

00:17:40,951 --> 00:17:43,587
Way to bury the lead, Hodges.
That's part
of my charm.

00:17:43,587 --> 00:17:45,022
It's all in the telling.

00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:46,456
FINLAY:
The regular.

00:17:46,456 --> 00:17:48,425
Yeah. Fruity.

00:17:48,425 --> 00:17:50,127
Okay, thanks so much.

00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:56,366
Hey. So I talked
to a couple
Hey.

00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:57,868
of the outreach
workers.

00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:00,938
They saw a guy earlier,
a guy named Rudy.

00:18:00,938 --> 00:18:02,472
He's a regular here.

00:18:02,472 --> 00:18:05,142
He was barefoot,
had bloodstained clothes.

00:18:05,142 --> 00:18:06,843
Sounds like our boy.

00:18:06,843 --> 00:18:08,445
FINLAY:
Yeah. According to the locals,

00:18:08,445 --> 00:18:09,880
he likes to hang out here,
under the bridge.

00:18:16,787 --> 00:18:17,988
Anybody seen Rudy?

00:18:17,988 --> 00:18:19,089
Huh?

00:18:20,123 --> 00:18:22,492
STOKES:
You seen Rudy?

00:18:22,492 --> 00:18:24,094
You know who Rudy is?

00:18:25,963 --> 00:18:27,664
Hey, where
does Rudy stay?

00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:34,972
Hey, old-timer.
Hey, man.

00:18:34,972 --> 00:18:37,074
You seen Rudy anywhere?

00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:54,725
Rudy!
(gasping)

00:18:54,725 --> 00:18:56,360
What's wrong?

00:18:57,461 --> 00:18:59,463
What have you
been doing, man?

00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:02,366
(panting)
Huh?

00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:07,671
Rudy, you're gonna have
to come with us.

00:19:07,671 --> 00:19:09,740
Rudy, it says here
in my files

00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:12,075
that you spent some time
in the state hospital.

00:19:12,075 --> 00:19:13,543
Had a few psych holds?

00:19:13,543 --> 00:19:16,680
Yeah, I have some problems.

00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,415
What did the doctors
diagnose you with?

00:19:19,516 --> 00:19:22,819
Schizophrenia, bipolar disorder,

00:19:22,819 --> 00:19:24,888
generalized anxiety,

00:19:24,888 --> 00:19:26,823
paranoia...
BRASS:
Well, that's okay.

00:19:26,823 --> 00:19:28,892
We get the idea.

00:19:28,892 --> 00:19:31,528
Do you recognize these two?
Richard and Ann?

00:19:31,528 --> 00:19:33,563
They're angels.

00:19:33,563 --> 00:19:36,833
What do you mean?
They rescued me.

00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:39,069
How?
I was on the
street, out front

00:19:39,069 --> 00:19:41,838
of a drugstore on Cramer.
Oh, that's

00:19:41,838 --> 00:19:44,374
right near
the Sky View Motel.
I go there sometimes

00:19:44,374 --> 00:19:47,577
to ask for change,
you know, and-and I...

00:19:47,577 --> 00:19:48,979
These guys,

00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,847
they jumped me and-and...

00:19:50,847 --> 00:19:52,649
and they beat me,

00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:55,986
and they took my change
and they took my shoes.

00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,754
And-and it probably
would have been worse,

00:19:57,754 --> 00:19:59,523
except that Richard and Ann
came along

00:19:59,523 --> 00:20:00,724
out of nowhere and...

00:20:00,724 --> 00:20:03,660
and chased them away.

00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,795
Rudy, what happened next?

00:20:07,764 --> 00:20:10,534
I told you, they're angels.

00:20:10,534 --> 00:20:12,636
They-they-they...

00:20:12,636 --> 00:20:14,104
they asked me if
I wanted to stay

00:20:14,104 --> 00:20:16,873
in their room with them,
and they got me a toothbrush

00:20:16,873 --> 00:20:19,443
and stuff, and they let me
get a shower

00:20:19,443 --> 00:20:21,078
and get all cleaned up.

00:20:21,078 --> 00:20:22,679
Did something happen
after the shower?

00:20:24,748 --> 00:20:26,116
Something happened, didn't it?

00:20:28,585 --> 00:20:29,753
(mutters): I don't know.

00:20:29,753 --> 00:20:31,488
I don't remember.

00:20:31,488 --> 00:20:33,557
Come on, Rudy, think.

00:20:33,557 --> 00:20:36,393
Think real hard.
(shuddering breath)

00:20:36,393 --> 00:20:37,360
(distorted shout):
No! No!

00:20:43,133 --> 00:20:44,701
There were these dolls...

00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:46,737
<i>a-and there were</i>
<i>a whole bunch of them,</i>

00:20:46,737 --> 00:20:50,006
<i>and they started talking to me</i>
<i>and they were looking at me.</i>

00:20:50,006 --> 00:20:51,108
(distorted screaming,
eerie voices speaking)

00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:55,579
What were they saying, Rudy?
What did they say?

00:20:55,579 --> 00:20:59,649
Did the dolls
tell you to do this?

00:20:59,649 --> 00:21:01,518
(gasps, screams)

00:21:01,518 --> 00:21:02,586
I...

00:21:05,388 --> 00:21:08,125
I did that, didn't I?
I did that with the scissors.

00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:09,760
I hurt them.

00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,128
(shrieking)

00:21:11,128 --> 00:21:12,562
(eerie, distorted,
high-pitched laughter)

00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:13,597
(shriek echoing)

00:21:13,597 --> 00:21:15,632
What about these people?

00:21:15,632 --> 00:21:17,434
(Rudy gasping repeatedly)

00:21:19,369 --> 00:21:20,570
Did you hurt them, too?

00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:25,809
I don't know.

00:21:25,809 --> 00:21:28,478
FINLAY: <i>You know, sometimes</i>
<i>I think we forget</i>

00:21:28,478 --> 00:21:30,914
what delicate,
complex machines we are.

00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:34,651
You know, all it takes are a few
short-circuiting synapses,

00:21:34,651 --> 00:21:37,120
or a breakdown
in myelination,

00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,922
and everything gets thrown
out of whack.

00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:41,691
Jules, you just
captured a killer.

00:21:41,691 --> 00:21:44,694
I know.
Then why do I feel so bad?

00:21:44,694 --> 00:21:46,062
Because he seems like
a nice guy

00:21:46,062 --> 00:21:48,031
who got dealt a lousy hand
in life.

00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:53,003
So we have him for killing
the Smiths, right?

00:21:53,003 --> 00:21:54,871
What about the other
two attacks?

00:21:54,871 --> 00:21:57,941
Well, I could go over all the
evidence and make a case.

00:21:57,941 --> 00:21:59,910
He's obviously
our prime suspect.

00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:04,548
He frequented the area,
and he's obviously unstable.

00:22:07,384 --> 00:22:08,685
Good work.

00:22:08,685 --> 00:22:10,821
You put some long hours
in on this.

00:22:10,821 --> 00:22:12,088
Why-why don't you go home,

00:22:12,088 --> 00:22:14,057
get yourself some rest.

00:22:27,671 --> 00:22:31,074
(TV playing indistinctly
in distance)

00:22:31,074 --> 00:22:33,643
(yelling, panting)

00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:35,712
Take it, take it easy!

00:22:35,712 --> 00:22:37,914
One plus one is two.
One for me and one for you.

00:22:37,914 --> 00:22:40,917
Two plus two is four. (panting)

00:22:40,917 --> 00:22:43,386
<i>That's a couple more.</i>
<i>Three plus three is six.</i>

00:22:43,386 --> 00:22:44,588
<i>Straight and crooked sticks!</i>

00:22:44,588 --> 00:22:45,589
Get away!

00:22:45,589 --> 00:22:48,992
(siren wailing)

00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:50,460
(muttering)

00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,461
One plus one is two.

00:22:51,461 --> 00:22:52,996
One for me and one for you.

00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:54,431
Two plus two is four,
and that's a couple more.

00:22:54,431 --> 00:22:55,899
(gasping)

00:22:55,899 --> 00:22:57,701
One plus one is two.
One for me and one for you.

00:22:57,701 --> 00:22:59,035
Two plus two is four.
That's a couple more.

00:22:59,035 --> 00:23:00,470
Three plus
three is six.
Ma'am.

00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:01,771
Straight and crooked sticks.

00:23:01,771 --> 00:23:03,006
You need to drop
that bottle, do you hear me?

00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:04,574
(whimpering)

00:23:04,574 --> 00:23:05,976
Four plus four is eight.
Seagulls on the gate!

00:23:05,976 --> 00:23:07,744
Five plus five is ten.
Hey!

00:23:07,744 --> 00:23:09,112
Do you hear
what I'm saying?!

00:23:09,112 --> 00:23:12,449
Drop the bottle!

00:23:12,449 --> 00:23:13,984
Ricky doesn't follow directions!

00:23:13,984 --> 00:23:17,020
He never follows directions!

00:23:18,088 --> 00:23:19,122
(yells)

00:23:19,122 --> 00:23:21,091
(Tazer clicking)

00:23:23,126 --> 00:23:24,461
Thanks, man.

00:23:24,461 --> 00:23:26,897
Seriously, thanks.

00:23:26,897 --> 00:23:28,531
Thanks.
All right.

00:23:28,531 --> 00:23:29,699
(gasps)

00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:31,001
Hey!

00:23:31,001 --> 00:23:32,569
Was she staying here?
In the motel?

00:23:32,569 --> 00:23:34,638
Uh, yeah, just
since tonight.

00:23:35,472 --> 00:23:36,439
What room?

00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,982
(door creaking)

00:23:48,485 --> 00:23:50,153
It's happened again.

00:23:59,496 --> 00:24:01,431
(indistinct radio communication,
siren whoops in distance)

00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:22,719
How the hell can this be?

00:24:22,719 --> 00:24:24,154
I thought we had our killer.

00:24:24,154 --> 00:24:26,523
Did we mess up, Jules?

00:24:26,523 --> 00:24:28,091
Did we make a mistake
with our-our homeless guy?

00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:30,794
No, Rudy's guilty,
maybe not of all three,

00:24:30,794 --> 00:24:32,796
but he definitely
killed the Smiths.

00:24:32,796 --> 00:24:33,930
Then how do we explain this?

00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,065
I don't know.

00:24:35,065 --> 00:24:37,133
It has to be... unrelated.

00:24:37,133 --> 00:24:38,702
Unrelated?

00:24:38,702 --> 00:24:40,470
Four murders in the same room

00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:42,005
over a three-month period.

00:24:42,005 --> 00:24:43,807
That's got to be connected,
don't you think?

00:24:43,807 --> 00:24:44,975
(garbled radio transmission)

00:24:46,743 --> 00:24:49,946
All right, I'm sorry. Look,

00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:51,414
all right, who are
our players tonight?

00:24:51,414 --> 00:24:53,049
Who are we talking about here?

00:24:53,049 --> 00:24:55,552
Suspect is a woman,

00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:57,921
28-year-old
high school math teacher.

00:24:57,921 --> 00:25:00,824
Victim was one of her students.

00:25:00,824 --> 00:25:03,927
Together in a sleazy,
$39-a-night motel room.

00:25:03,927 --> 00:25:08,932
With lingerie, condoms,
sex toys and alcohol.

00:25:08,932 --> 00:25:10,500
Wonder what
was going on here, right?

00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,035
Yeah, according

00:25:12,035 --> 00:25:13,436
to the high school Web site,

00:25:13,436 --> 00:25:14,904
she was just named
Teacher of the Year.

00:25:14,904 --> 00:25:16,106
I'll bet she was.

00:25:16,106 --> 00:25:17,474
Hey.
Hey.

00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:18,842
So, this may

00:25:18,842 --> 00:25:20,577
sound crazy,
but I'm thinking

00:25:20,577 --> 00:25:22,545
that this isn't
what it looks like.

00:25:22,545 --> 00:25:23,780
I don't believe
that the teacher

00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,148
was sleeping with her student.

00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:26,983
Yeah, you're right,
that sounds crazy.

00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:28,718
Well, listen to this voice mail

00:25:28,718 --> 00:25:30,120
I found on her phone.

00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,154
YOUNG MAN:
Ms. Stone, it's Matthew.

00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:32,722
I don't know what to do,

00:25:32,722 --> 00:25:35,392
but my parents have been
drinking and fighting,

00:25:35,392 --> 00:25:37,827
and I can't go home;

00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:40,563
I'm at a motel.

00:25:40,563 --> 00:25:41,698
But I'm scared.

00:25:41,698 --> 00:25:43,600
I don't know who else to call.

00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,102
I'm sorry, but you have
to help, please.

00:25:46,102 --> 00:25:49,139
BRASS: Ms. Stone, we are
trying to make sense

00:25:49,139 --> 00:25:52,876
out of what happened
in that room.

00:25:52,876 --> 00:25:54,611
But we need your help
to do that.

00:25:54,611 --> 00:25:57,881
STOKES:
Boy, Matthew must
have told you

00:25:57,881 --> 00:26:01,951
a really sad story
to lure you to that motel room.

00:26:01,951 --> 00:26:04,087
Now, obviously,

00:26:04,087 --> 00:26:06,856
from the items he brought along,
he had ideas of getting

00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:08,825
romantic with you.
BRASS:
Now, there were a lot of empty

00:26:08,825 --> 00:26:10,360
liquor bottles in the room.

00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,594
Was the young man drunk?

00:26:11,594 --> 00:26:14,030
There wasn't any drinking.

00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:17,734
First thing I did was dump
all the alcohol down the sink.

00:26:17,734 --> 00:26:19,069
I wanted it
clear to Matthew

00:26:19,069 --> 00:26:21,071
that nothing was going
to happen.

00:26:21,071 --> 00:26:22,439
Did he get upset?

00:26:22,439 --> 00:26:23,440
Is that when he threatened you?

00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,442
He would never.

00:26:25,442 --> 00:26:29,012
Matthew's a...
Matthew's a great kid.

00:26:29,012 --> 00:26:31,581
He just had a harmless crush,
that's all.

00:26:31,581 --> 00:26:33,583
He would never hurt me.

00:26:33,583 --> 00:26:34,851
Then why did you kill him?

00:26:39,522 --> 00:26:42,992
It wasn't me.

00:26:42,992 --> 00:26:44,494
Really? Wasn't you?

00:26:44,494 --> 00:26:45,495
Ms. Stone,

00:26:45,495 --> 00:26:46,529
look, look at this.

00:26:47,597 --> 00:26:50,500
(whimpering, grunts)

00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,735
That's not me.

00:26:52,735 --> 00:26:55,839
I mean, it's me, it's my body,
but I...

00:26:58,074 --> 00:26:59,642
I had no control.

00:26:59,642 --> 00:27:01,845
It was like there was
something inside me.

00:27:01,845 --> 00:27:02,979
I was...

00:27:05,148 --> 00:27:07,150
...possessed.

00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:08,651
BRASS:
You were what?

00:27:08,651 --> 00:27:10,954
(crying):
I was...

00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:15,391
I don't know. Part of me
really wants to believe her.

00:27:15,391 --> 00:27:17,427
I mean, the woman ranting
and screaming on that video

00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:20,096
from last night was nothing
like the woman I met today.

00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:22,799
They were two totally
different people.

00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:25,502
So, her behavior last night
was completely out of character.

00:27:25,502 --> 00:27:27,637
Mm-hmm!
Did the hospital do
a tox screen?

00:27:27,637 --> 00:27:29,939
Yeah, it was clean.
Not even alcohol.

00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:33,409
Then it's got to be the room.

00:27:33,409 --> 00:27:35,545
The room made her do it.

00:27:35,545 --> 00:27:38,081
What, like, <i>The Shining?</i> Hmm?

00:27:38,081 --> 00:27:39,415
The Overlook Hotel?

00:27:39,415 --> 00:27:40,783
It's the one thing

00:27:40,783 --> 00:27:43,586
connecting all of the murders.

00:27:43,586 --> 00:27:45,488
Right now, it's the only thing.

00:27:45,488 --> 00:27:49,726
Okay, so, let's have Hodges
and Henry drag their equipment

00:27:49,726 --> 00:27:51,961
out there and test the room,
see what they have to say.

00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,035
Hmm.

00:28:00,703 --> 00:28:02,438
(electronic crackling)

00:28:02,438 --> 00:28:05,141
I've got some elevated VOCs
in the air conditioner,

00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:08,444
but nothing that would explain
any of the bizarre behavior.

00:28:08,444 --> 00:28:10,780
What about you?

00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,649
You got anything yet?

00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:14,817
Could I have five minutes
to look first?

00:28:18,855 --> 00:28:21,558
Oh, and I'm very much enjoying
the dirty bathroom.

00:28:21,558 --> 00:28:22,692
Thank you for that.

00:28:26,462 --> 00:28:28,731
(sighs)

00:28:28,731 --> 00:28:30,967
Mm! Mm...

00:28:30,967 --> 00:28:33,002
Great. Now I can smell
like a fruit bowl

00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:34,470
for the rest of the day.

00:28:40,843 --> 00:28:42,812
(electronic crackling)

00:28:55,725 --> 00:28:58,494
(electronic crackling)

00:29:12,008 --> 00:29:13,610
(electronic crackling)

00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:14,811
It looks like
they've got mold

00:29:14,811 --> 00:29:17,647
inside the walls of the closet.

00:29:17,647 --> 00:29:19,449
I'm going to have
to get a sample.

00:29:19,449 --> 00:29:21,618
Do you have the pry bar
in there?

00:29:21,618 --> 00:29:23,886
Hey, I have
to open some drywall.

00:29:23,886 --> 00:29:25,989
Do you have the pry bar
in your kit?

00:29:25,989 --> 00:29:27,590
Hodges!

00:29:29,525 --> 00:29:31,361
Seriously?

00:29:31,361 --> 00:29:33,563
(sighs)

00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:35,565
Hodges, what
are you doing?

00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:36,599
I was calling you.

00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:37,967
(grunting, huffing)

00:29:43,106 --> 00:29:44,507
What are you
looking at?

00:29:46,376 --> 00:29:47,110
(grunting, growling)

00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:52,048
What, what's
going on with you?

00:29:52,048 --> 00:29:54,517
I know who you are.

00:29:54,517 --> 00:29:56,653
Okay, look, w-why don't you
have a seat on the toilet...

00:29:56,653 --> 00:29:58,821
(continues indistinctly)

00:29:58,821 --> 00:30:00,757
I'm gonna help you
out, come here.

00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:03,793
I can see what you are!

00:30:03,793 --> 00:30:05,762
(yelling)

00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:08,598
Hodges, let go of me!
That hurts!

00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:10,900
(Hodges grunts, pants)

00:30:13,936 --> 00:30:15,805
No... Hodges!

00:30:15,805 --> 00:30:16,939
No, no...!

00:30:19,809 --> 00:30:20,877
(Hodges pounding on door)

00:30:20,877 --> 00:30:22,412
This is Henry Andrews.

00:30:22,412 --> 00:30:24,814
I'm at the Sky View Motel,
room 114,

00:30:24,814 --> 00:30:26,783
and I have an emergency.

00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:28,551
I need police and EMS
immediately.

00:30:28,551 --> 00:30:29,652
(Hodges yelling, bellowing)

00:30:34,424 --> 00:30:35,925
Excuse me...
Hey! Henry!

00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,061
Henry?

00:30:38,061 --> 00:30:39,362
Hey, man, you all right?

00:30:39,362 --> 00:30:40,396
What's going on out here?

00:30:40,396 --> 00:30:41,831
I don't know exactly.

00:30:41,831 --> 00:30:43,800
He just flipped out.

00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,436
Nick, I honestly think
he would have killed me.

00:30:46,436 --> 00:30:48,404
Hodges?
Yeah, but it
wasn't Hodges.

00:30:48,404 --> 00:30:49,972
I mean, if you would've
seen the look in his eyes,

00:30:49,972 --> 00:30:51,541
something must have
happened to him in there,

00:30:51,541 --> 00:30:53,810
something that
triggered this.

00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,445
What'd he say to you?
Nothing.

00:30:55,445 --> 00:30:56,879
Everything that came out
of him was unintelligible.

00:30:56,879 --> 00:30:58,381
It was grunts

00:30:58,381 --> 00:31:00,016
and growls.
Hey, so paramedics
hit him

00:31:00,016 --> 00:31:01,384
with a sedative.

00:31:01,384 --> 00:31:02,919
Once they get him to
the hospital,

00:31:02,919 --> 00:31:04,520
maybe we'll figure out
what's going on.

00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,422
Wait, wait, before he goes,

00:31:06,422 --> 00:31:07,423
I-I need a-a... a swab.

00:31:07,423 --> 00:31:08,658
Check your vest.

00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:09,726
ANDREWS:
Hold up.

00:31:09,726 --> 00:31:11,661
Hey, buddy,

00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:12,829
I just need
to get some saliva.

00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:14,497
Can you help me out?
(mumbling)

00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:15,631
Can you open up?

00:31:15,631 --> 00:31:16,966
Come on,
just open up.

00:31:16,966 --> 00:31:19,535
There you go,
help me out.

00:31:19,535 --> 00:31:20,837
There you go.

00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:22,004
Good.

00:31:22,004 --> 00:31:23,773
Yeah, get him out of here.

00:31:28,878 --> 00:31:30,613
DOCTOR:
Vitals are good...

00:31:30,613 --> 00:31:32,615
(doctor continues
indistinctly)

00:31:32,615 --> 00:31:33,916
RUSSELL: Thanks, Doc.
I appreciate it.

00:31:33,916 --> 00:31:35,118
You're welcome.

00:31:35,118 --> 00:31:36,786
What did he say?
How's he doing?

00:31:36,786 --> 00:31:38,454
He's gonna be okay.

00:31:38,454 --> 00:31:40,656
I mean, his vitals are all
in the normal range.

00:31:40,656 --> 00:31:43,059
He doesn't seem to be
in any physical distress.

00:31:43,059 --> 00:31:44,961
Well, obviously there is
something going on

00:31:44,961 --> 00:31:46,129
in that motel room.

00:31:46,129 --> 00:31:48,564
Now we need to add Hodges
to the list

00:31:48,564 --> 00:31:50,066
of people that went
nuts in there, right?

00:31:50,066 --> 00:31:51,701
Homeless guy, the teacher--

00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:54,604
Makes me wonder about our
first victim, Mark Bell.

00:31:54,604 --> 00:31:56,572
Who's to say he didn't
go crazy, too,

00:31:56,572 --> 00:31:58,574
and stab himself in his legs.

00:31:58,574 --> 00:32:00,843
If all of this is true,

00:32:00,843 --> 00:32:03,913
what's it say about the man
who lost his wife?

00:32:03,913 --> 00:32:05,782
ANDREWS:
Hey, guys,

00:32:05,782 --> 00:32:07,417
you are not gonna
believe this, but

00:32:07,417 --> 00:32:08,618
Hodges was drugged.

00:32:08,618 --> 00:32:09,919
What are you talking about?

00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:12,822
LSD-- I did an ELISA test
on his saliva.

00:32:12,822 --> 00:32:14,524
Somehow, he must've been dosed

00:32:14,524 --> 00:32:16,025
while we were
in the room working.

00:32:16,025 --> 00:32:18,361
Wait a minute, didn't the
hospital do a tox screen

00:32:18,361 --> 00:32:20,696
on the teacher and on Rudy,
and it came back negative?

00:32:20,696 --> 00:32:23,032
The standard tox panel
doesn't test for LSD,

00:32:23,032 --> 00:32:24,534
so they were probably
dosed, too--

00:32:24,534 --> 00:32:26,002
we just had no way
to know it.

00:32:26,002 --> 00:32:27,537
But wh-why the violence?

00:32:27,537 --> 00:32:30,006
The molecules I found
were highly adulterated,

00:32:30,006 --> 00:32:32,875
and cut with a cyclidine
similar to PCP.

00:32:32,875 --> 00:32:34,744
Probably came out of
somebody's kitchen sink.

00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:36,746
Okay.

00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:37,713
Now we know what.

00:32:38,948 --> 00:32:41,117
Let's go find out how.

00:32:43,853 --> 00:32:45,054
STOKES (muffled):
So, according to Henry,

00:32:45,054 --> 00:32:48,090
this lysergic acid glows blue.

00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:49,692
And the stuff's potent.

00:32:49,692 --> 00:32:51,027
We may not be looking
for much.

00:32:51,027 --> 00:32:52,128
SANDERS (muffled):
Wait a minute--

00:32:52,128 --> 00:32:53,062
got something over here.

00:32:55,031 --> 00:32:57,433
These are tiny drops.

00:32:57,433 --> 00:33:00,536
It looks like they might've
been aerosolized.

00:33:04,807 --> 00:33:08,544
STOKES: Check it out--
covered in blue.

00:33:08,544 --> 00:33:10,112
This is our source
right here.

00:33:10,112 --> 00:33:12,381
SANDERS: If Hodges
got sprayed by that,

00:33:12,381 --> 00:33:14,650
it would only have to land
on his lips

00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:17,019
or in his eye, and it would
be instantly absorbed.

00:33:25,027 --> 00:33:26,829
Here, let me bag it.

00:33:29,532 --> 00:33:31,367
Hold on here.

00:33:31,367 --> 00:33:34,604
I don't think the LSD was
coming from that cartridge.

00:33:36,439 --> 00:33:37,907
There's a hose in here.

00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:42,845
Yeah, and it's coming
through the wall

00:33:42,845 --> 00:33:44,146
from the next room.

00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:50,686
(pounding on door)

00:33:50,686 --> 00:33:53,422
STOKES: Hey, Oscar, can we use
your bathroom for a second?

00:33:53,422 --> 00:33:54,991
Hey! You can't come
in here like this!

00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:56,959
Sure we can.
Check it out, Greg.

00:33:56,959 --> 00:33:59,762
It's called
probable cause, Oscar.

00:34:00,963 --> 00:34:01,898
What do you got?

00:34:07,436 --> 00:34:08,638
Found the source.

00:34:10,706 --> 00:34:13,142
Oscar, I remember
standing right there

00:34:13,142 --> 00:34:15,144
and listening to you
preach to me about God's will.

00:34:15,144 --> 00:34:16,379
Is this what you meant? Huh?

00:34:16,379 --> 00:34:17,613
Killing six people?

00:34:17,613 --> 00:34:19,549
I didn't kill anyone.

00:34:19,549 --> 00:34:21,751
You've been spraying LSD
all over the bathroom next door.

00:34:21,751 --> 00:34:23,786
You're responsible!

00:34:23,786 --> 00:34:24,954
I don't know what
you're talking about.

00:34:24,954 --> 00:34:26,055
God sees the truth.

00:34:26,055 --> 00:34:27,657
Yes, sir!
God knows my heart!

00:34:27,657 --> 00:34:28,991
STOKES: You know what?
I'm tired of hearing that.

00:34:28,991 --> 00:34:31,727
Sit down, relax.
I'm gonna get you a ride.

00:34:31,727 --> 00:34:33,529
SANDERS: Nick,
take a look at this.

00:34:38,467 --> 00:34:40,136
That's an odd place for a TV.

00:34:44,473 --> 00:34:47,777
That's the room next door--
room 114.

00:34:47,777 --> 00:34:50,379
So not only have you been dosing
the people next door,

00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:51,914
you've been recording it, too?

00:34:51,914 --> 00:34:54,717
Hey, Nick, I don't see
any recording device.

00:34:56,485 --> 00:34:58,421
But there's this transmitter

00:34:58,421 --> 00:35:00,389
set up to send a signal
someplace else.

00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:02,625
So what's with all
the video stuff?
I don't know.

00:35:02,625 --> 00:35:04,060
I just know I'm not
supposed to touch it.

00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,394
Yeah? Who told you that?

00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:07,563
Huh?

00:35:09,031 --> 00:35:11,400
Trent, the manager.

00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,703
He said if I did,
he'd kick me out.

00:35:17,473 --> 00:35:20,443
Trent Raeger, got a warrant.
See you downtown.

00:35:26,515 --> 00:35:27,550
(door shuts)

00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:37,693
Hey, Nick,

00:35:37,693 --> 00:35:40,029
you gotta come
and see this.

00:35:40,029 --> 00:35:42,598
Our peeper has been looking
at all the rooms,

00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:44,400
not just room 114.

00:35:52,074 --> 00:35:55,077
Yeah, he's been spending
some quality time in here.

00:36:04,987 --> 00:36:08,457
Hmm. These are all souvenirs...

00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:11,927
...from his favorite guests.

00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:19,635
BRASS: You've been peeping
on room 114 for a long time,

00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:21,937
haven't you, Trent?

00:36:21,937 --> 00:36:24,473
At what point did you decide
that it wasn't enough

00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:26,008
to just be a voyeur?

00:36:26,008 --> 00:36:28,611
I mean, when did you decide
that you needed to kill people?

00:36:28,611 --> 00:36:31,113
It isn't like that.

00:36:31,113 --> 00:36:33,616
Okay, then tell me
what it's like.

00:36:33,616 --> 00:36:35,084
Well, it's just about...

00:36:37,787 --> 00:36:39,722
...watching, you know?

00:36:39,722 --> 00:36:43,092
All the people coming
through the motel.

00:36:43,092 --> 00:36:45,828
When I was a kid, we'd get
families on vacation,

00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:49,098
and I was curious because
we never took vacations.

00:36:49,098 --> 00:36:52,501
We never left.

00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:54,537
So...

00:36:54,537 --> 00:36:55,805
I had these special places

00:36:55,805 --> 00:36:57,573
where I could look
through the walls...

00:36:57,573 --> 00:36:59,375
watch them.

00:36:59,375 --> 00:37:01,410
(whispers):
Special places.

00:37:02,712 --> 00:37:03,946
Then the video age came

00:37:03,946 --> 00:37:05,915
and you upgraded
your little hobby, right?

00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,819
That was pretty cool, too.

00:37:09,819 --> 00:37:11,520
I mean, especially when
the motel kind of

00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,788
went downhill, you know?

00:37:12,788 --> 00:37:15,891
That brought all kinds
of crazy stuff.

00:37:15,891 --> 00:37:18,127
The crack whores, drunk dudes,

00:37:18,127 --> 00:37:20,129
beating their wives, they...

00:37:20,129 --> 00:37:23,766
That is a show, believe me.

00:37:23,766 --> 00:37:25,868
But even that
got a little old and dull,

00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:28,971
so you spiced it up by
dosing people with drugs?

00:37:28,971 --> 00:37:34,910
A few months ago, I saw this guy
out on Third, tripping on acid.

00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:37,780
He was, like, out of his mind,

00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:41,517
and it was just so...

00:37:41,517 --> 00:37:43,018
so weird.

00:37:44,854 --> 00:37:48,090
And that is when I came up with
that rig for the bathroom.

00:37:49,825 --> 00:37:53,596
You have to admit...
it is pretty clever.

00:37:53,596 --> 00:37:55,531
Clever.

00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:09,078
Five people are dead,
one is in the hospital.

00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:13,382
Hey, I just put the gas
in the car... okay?

00:38:13,382 --> 00:38:15,084
They're the ones
that crashed it.

00:38:18,621 --> 00:38:20,623
Come on...

00:38:20,623 --> 00:38:23,159
you've got my tapes;
you've seen 'em.

00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:27,062
That first dude,
hacking his legs off.

00:38:27,062 --> 00:38:30,599
Or that teacher...
oh, and the homeless guy.

00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:33,068
I mean, the dude is
already a total mess,

00:38:33,068 --> 00:38:35,104
and then the lady has
all those dolls!

00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:37,973
I mean, that was a gift.

00:38:37,973 --> 00:38:40,543
Or the poor Mexican guy...

00:38:40,543 --> 00:38:42,878
killing his wife.

00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:46,482
Honestly, I didn't
see that coming.

00:38:46,482 --> 00:38:47,650
I mean, that...

00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:48,851
that...

00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:52,888
...that was awesome.

00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:56,492
(quietly):
Awesome.

00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:00,496
What are you looking
at me like that for?

00:39:00,496 --> 00:39:03,499
Come on, people go online
every day to look at stuff

00:39:03,499 --> 00:39:05,000
that's just like that.

00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,836
But you manipulated this.

00:39:06,836 --> 00:39:09,972
You made this happen.

00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:12,775
You made these people,
these innocent people,

00:39:12,775 --> 00:39:14,510
do these things.

00:39:16,846 --> 00:39:17,847
So what?

00:39:19,448 --> 00:39:21,884
What's the difference?

00:39:24,453 --> 00:39:27,122
Well, you'll have 25 years
to life to figure that out.

00:39:27,122 --> 00:39:30,960
And the weird thing is you're
gonna be in a little room

00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,596
where people watching you 24/7.

00:39:39,902 --> 00:39:41,036
Hey.

00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:46,141
I, uh, heard they're going
to be discharging you soon.

00:39:46,141 --> 00:39:48,010
Yeah.

00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:50,880
I guess I've healed as much
as I'm going to.

00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,415
Well, I... I came 'cause
I wanted you to know

00:39:53,415 --> 00:39:54,783
that we arrested
the man responsible

00:39:54,783 --> 00:39:57,086
for what happened to you
and to your wife.

00:39:57,086 --> 00:39:58,754
He didn't physically
do the killings,

00:39:58,754 --> 00:40:00,623
but he is responsible.

00:40:00,623 --> 00:40:03,792
Well, I-I... I'm sorry,
I'm a little confused here.

00:40:03,792 --> 00:40:05,728
The man we arrested...

00:40:05,728 --> 00:40:07,463
lived in the motel,

00:40:07,463 --> 00:40:10,366
and he drugged
several of his guests.

00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:16,105
That night, when your wife
went to sleep,

00:40:16,105 --> 00:40:19,508
you went into the bathroom
and you snuck a cigarette.

00:40:19,508 --> 00:40:20,910
While you were in the bathroom,

00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:25,381
you were dosed with
a very potent psychedelic drug,

00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:29,518
and it caused a violent
change in your personality

00:40:29,518 --> 00:40:31,053
and your behavior.

00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:34,390
That face... that you saw...

00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,926
the man who was hitting
your wife...

00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:54,376
Uh... in a little while,

00:40:54,376 --> 00:40:56,912
there's going to be some
police officers coming here,

00:40:56,912 --> 00:41:00,616
and you're going to need
to go with them, okay?

00:41:00,616 --> 00:41:03,052
I'm sorry.

00:41:23,872 --> 00:41:27,443
I want to apologize
for anything I may have said

00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:28,911
while I wasn't myself.

00:41:28,911 --> 00:41:32,881
It wasn't your words so much
as your actions, really.

00:41:39,688 --> 00:41:42,658
And, obviously...

00:41:42,658 --> 00:41:44,593
I apologize for those, too.

00:41:47,563 --> 00:41:50,899
Apology accepted?

00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:57,706
Yes.

00:41:59,508 --> 00:42:00,542
(sighs with relief)

00:42:00,542 --> 00:42:01,810
Apology accepted.

00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:03,012
Good.

00:42:03,012 --> 00:42:04,380
Then you won't be trying to

00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:05,814
get back at me in some way?

00:42:05,814 --> 00:42:08,384
No, of course not.

00:42:10,019 --> 00:42:12,654
But I wouldn't drink
that coffee, if I were you.
