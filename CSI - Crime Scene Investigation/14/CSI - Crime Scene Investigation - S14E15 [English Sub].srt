00:00:01,661 --> 00:00:03,596
(wind blowing)

00:00:33,727 --> 00:00:36,196
(dog barks in distance)

00:00:49,743 --> 00:00:51,678
(buzzes)

00:01:07,994 --> 00:01:09,896
(siren approaching)

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,241
STOKES:
Man, do you know
how close I was

00:01:21,241 --> 00:01:22,776
to being off the
clock when you called?

00:01:22,776 --> 00:01:24,644
Yeah, I thought about
waiting ten minutes,

00:01:24,644 --> 00:01:25,845
dumping it on
the day shift,

00:01:25,845 --> 00:01:27,414
but for the victim's sake

00:01:27,414 --> 00:01:29,783
I thought we'd go with
the "A" team.

00:01:29,783 --> 00:01:31,518
Oh, boy,
she looks really young.

00:01:31,518 --> 00:01:33,720
CRAWFORD:
16. Just got her license.

00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,255
Name's Debbie Logan.

00:01:36,756 --> 00:01:38,792
Nevada plates.
Is she local?

00:01:38,792 --> 00:01:40,660
CRAWFORD:
Let's see, the address
is in Rowan.

00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,762
That's, what,
another 30 miles out?

00:01:42,762 --> 00:01:45,932
Yeah. Car's registered
to her parents, same address.

00:01:45,932 --> 00:01:47,667
No money,

00:01:47,667 --> 00:01:48,835
no phone...

00:01:48,835 --> 00:01:50,503
Could've started as a robbery.

00:01:50,503 --> 00:01:54,407
Yeah, someone whacked her
in the head real good.

00:01:54,407 --> 00:01:56,242
But I don't think it happened
in the car.

00:01:56,242 --> 00:01:57,710
There's just not enough blood.

00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:01,214
She was definitely on
the ground at some point.

00:02:01,214 --> 00:02:02,782
Her clothes are dirty.

00:02:02,782 --> 00:02:05,351
She's got what looks like
blue tinsel in her hair.

00:02:05,351 --> 00:02:06,686
Put a call in to her parents.

00:02:06,686 --> 00:02:08,421
Didn't even know
she had left the house.

00:02:08,421 --> 00:02:09,923
Thought she was still
in her bed, asleep.

00:02:09,923 --> 00:02:11,691
Hmm.

00:02:11,691 --> 00:02:12,759
Algebra books,

00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:14,360
Bible study books...

00:02:16,529 --> 00:02:18,665
I don't think she was a runaway.

00:02:18,665 --> 00:02:20,300
Makes you wonder

00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,535
where she snuck off to
last night, doesn't it?

00:02:22,535 --> 00:02:23,937
Yeah, but what
I really want to know

00:02:23,937 --> 00:02:26,706
is how the hell
she ended up way out here.

It always takes
a little out of me

00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:14,854
when I see them
this young.

00:03:19,626 --> 00:03:21,194
ROBBINS:
I know what you mean.

00:03:21,194 --> 00:03:22,896
And I'm afraid
the story only gets worse.

00:03:22,896 --> 00:03:24,898
PHILLIPS:
Found skin under
her fingernails.

00:03:24,898 --> 00:03:26,499
I went ahead and ordered
an SAE kit.

00:03:26,499 --> 00:03:27,834
And...?

00:03:27,834 --> 00:03:29,702
Wet mount revealed
the presence of semen.

00:03:29,702 --> 00:03:31,404
ROBBINS:
That, along with

00:03:31,404 --> 00:03:33,640
vaginal bruising and
the abrasions she sustained...

00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,209
I'd have to say she was
sexually assaulted.

00:03:42,615 --> 00:03:45,218
Is this wound
the cause of death?

00:03:45,218 --> 00:03:46,686
Blunt force trauma

00:03:46,686 --> 00:03:48,521
and the attenuating
brain injuries.

00:03:48,521 --> 00:03:51,324
Time of death, somewhere between
midnight and 3:00 a.m.

00:03:51,324 --> 00:03:52,325
Any thoughts on a weapon?

00:03:52,325 --> 00:03:53,326
The margins

00:03:53,326 --> 00:03:54,894
are irregular and jagged,

00:03:54,894 --> 00:03:56,696
so nothing with
a blade or sharp edge.

00:03:58,364 --> 00:03:59,465
And this cut on her knee?

00:03:59,465 --> 00:04:01,434
Pre-mortem or post?

00:04:01,434 --> 00:04:02,835
Well, let's have a look.

00:04:05,672 --> 00:04:08,308
There's some sort of
paper fiber stuck to it.

00:04:08,308 --> 00:04:09,542
Probably bathroom tissue.

00:04:09,542 --> 00:04:10,643
Maybe somebody

00:04:10,643 --> 00:04:12,512
dabbed at it
to stop the bleeding.

00:04:12,512 --> 00:04:14,480
In which case,
the cut was certainly

00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,216
prior to the fatal blow.

00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:18,351
Hold on.

00:04:18,351 --> 00:04:19,652
There's
something else.

00:04:19,652 --> 00:04:20,853
It's embedded much deeper.

00:04:24,591 --> 00:04:25,758
Huh.

00:04:25,758 --> 00:04:26,859
Looks like a
piece of glass.

00:04:26,859 --> 00:04:28,294
It is.

00:04:28,294 --> 00:04:29,729
I'll get this off to Hodges.

00:04:41,908 --> 00:04:43,309
ROBBINS:
You-you all right?

00:04:43,309 --> 00:04:44,544
Finn?
You all right?

00:04:44,544 --> 00:04:46,980
Yeah.
Yeah, just...

00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:47,981
Just a...

00:04:47,981 --> 00:04:49,449
16-year-old girl

00:04:49,449 --> 00:04:50,550
having to face the horror

00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:52,752
of being raped and killed...

00:04:53,987 --> 00:04:55,855
Just never understand it.

00:04:58,257 --> 00:04:59,692
LOGAN: <i>We didn't even know</i>
<i>she was out.</i>

00:04:59,692 --> 00:05:01,628
We thought she was still asleep.

00:05:01,628 --> 00:05:04,631
And then the detective called.

00:05:04,631 --> 00:05:05,898
Was it like your daughter

00:05:05,898 --> 00:05:07,700
to sneak out of the house?
No.

00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,936
Not at all.

00:05:09,936 --> 00:05:11,604
Did she say anything last night

00:05:11,604 --> 00:05:13,339
before she went to bed?

00:05:13,339 --> 00:05:16,309
I... I-I don't know,
I wasn't there.

00:05:16,309 --> 00:05:18,711
I was ministering
to some parishioners.

00:05:18,711 --> 00:05:20,647
No, she didn't say anything.

00:05:20,647 --> 00:05:22,215
It was just
a normal night.

00:05:22,215 --> 00:05:24,751
She did her homework
and she went upstairs.

00:05:24,751 --> 00:05:26,753
I don't
understand.

00:05:26,753 --> 00:05:28,221
Why would she have
left the house?

00:05:28,221 --> 00:05:29,222
Where would
she go?

00:05:29,222 --> 00:05:30,556
Did she have a boyfriend?

00:05:30,556 --> 00:05:31,958
LOGAN:
No. She never even

00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:33,626
talked about boys.
That wasn't her thing.

00:05:34,827 --> 00:05:37,764
Well, uh... what was her thing?

00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,536
I don't know.
The usual

00:05:43,536 --> 00:05:45,271
for a 16-year-old,
I guess.

00:05:45,271 --> 00:05:47,473
She hung out with her friends,
she went to school...

00:05:47,473 --> 00:05:49,842
She didn't call to say she was
in any kind of trouble, did she?

00:05:49,842 --> 00:05:52,245
Actually...
we have her phone.

00:05:52,245 --> 00:05:53,246
We took it from her.

00:05:53,246 --> 00:05:55,248
And not because
she was bad.

00:05:55,248 --> 00:05:56,683
Her grades
had slipped.

00:05:56,683 --> 00:05:58,418
She was supposed
to earn her phone back.

00:05:58,418 --> 00:06:00,253
Uh, look,
Mr. Russell,

00:06:00,253 --> 00:06:01,421
I know what you're thinking.

00:06:01,421 --> 00:06:02,822
I minister to families
all the time

00:06:02,822 --> 00:06:04,991
whose kids are out of control.

00:06:04,991 --> 00:06:07,460
And that is...

00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,462
That wasn't Debbie.

00:06:09,462 --> 00:06:10,530
She worked hard in school,

00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:11,831
she helped out around my church,

00:06:11,831 --> 00:06:14,400
she taught Bible study
to the preschoolers.

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,335
She really was an angel.

00:06:25,211 --> 00:06:27,613
♪ ♪

00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:39,959
Seatback to pedal is 44 inches.

00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:42,562
Way too far back for
our victim's height.

00:06:42,562 --> 00:06:45,231
Whoever dumped the body
probably adjusted the seat.

00:06:45,231 --> 00:06:46,532
Someone tall.

00:06:46,532 --> 00:06:48,434
Judging from the distance,
around six feet.

00:06:48,434 --> 00:06:50,369
You manage to pull any prints

00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:51,938
off the button
that controls the seat?

00:06:51,938 --> 00:06:54,440
No, so far
everything's been smeared.

00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,210
I'm guessing either
the killer was wearing gloves,

00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:58,978
or he wiped everything down
before he bailed.

00:07:03,649 --> 00:07:04,951
It rained yesterday, right?

00:07:04,951 --> 00:07:06,619
SANDERS:
Yeah. For a while.

00:07:06,619 --> 00:07:08,654
This flyer isn't
weathered or faded.

00:07:08,654 --> 00:07:11,324
Might have been put
on the car last night.

00:07:11,324 --> 00:07:12,492
"3.99 breakfast
special.

00:07:12,492 --> 00:07:14,727
Patty's Diner."
Here we go.

00:07:16,596 --> 00:07:17,597
Finally.

00:07:17,597 --> 00:07:18,598
You got a print?

00:07:18,598 --> 00:07:19,799
Yeah, big
and juicy.

00:07:22,235 --> 00:07:23,369
Could be from the last person

00:07:23,369 --> 00:07:24,303
who touched the car.

00:07:25,738 --> 00:07:27,240
The killer.

00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,742
(machine humming)

00:07:29,742 --> 00:07:31,444
FINLAY:
Hey.

00:07:31,444 --> 00:07:32,945
I know what you're
going to say.

00:07:32,945 --> 00:07:34,480
"I want to be dazzled."

00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,948
Oh, let's not set
the bar that high.

00:07:35,948 --> 00:07:36,983
What do you
know about

00:07:36,983 --> 00:07:38,284
the glass fragment?

00:07:38,284 --> 00:07:39,852
Well, for starters, it's old.

00:07:39,852 --> 00:07:41,254
Oh, how old?

00:07:41,254 --> 00:07:42,421
HODGES:
At least 100 years.

00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:43,823
X-ray fluorescence revealed

00:07:43,823 --> 00:07:45,658
revealed a significant
amount of manganese.

00:07:45,658 --> 00:07:46,993
And manganese
was eliminated

00:07:46,993 --> 00:07:48,394
from the
glass-making process

00:07:48,394 --> 00:07:50,429
prior to the start of
the First World War.

00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:52,265
Interesting fact:

00:07:52,265 --> 00:07:54,433
manganese glass is actually
clear when it's produced,

00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:56,769
but then over time,
sunlight turns it purple.

00:07:56,769 --> 00:07:58,271
What else?

00:07:58,271 --> 00:08:00,540
Well, the glass
fragment is curved.

00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,908
And extrapolating
from the curve,

00:08:01,908 --> 00:08:04,544
I have determined
that your piece

00:08:04,544 --> 00:08:06,679
came from a bottle
with a base radius

00:08:06,679 --> 00:08:08,848
of a little over an inch...

00:08:08,848 --> 00:08:11,851
something like one of these
apothecary bottles.

00:08:11,851 --> 00:08:14,520
Not bad, Hodges.
Hey, guys.

00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,656
I processed the semen from
the sexual assault kit.

00:08:16,656 --> 00:08:18,658
Semen DNA
matches DNA

00:08:18,658 --> 00:08:20,793
from the tissue found under
the victim's fingernails.

00:08:20,793 --> 00:08:22,829
So she fought off
her attacker.
Yeah, but

00:08:22,829 --> 00:08:24,463
the DNA profile
isn't in the system.

00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:25,498
Sorry.

00:08:25,498 --> 00:08:27,333
Oh... me, too.

00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:28,568
SANDERS: Were the
parents any help

00:08:28,568 --> 00:08:30,336
figuring out where
their daughter was?

00:08:30,336 --> 00:08:32,405
They weren't, actually.
It's kind of strange.

00:08:32,405 --> 00:08:34,707
I never got any sense of
connection from them.

00:08:34,707 --> 00:08:37,343
I mean, the father's out on
church business all the time,

00:08:37,343 --> 00:08:38,678
but-but the mother...

00:08:38,678 --> 00:08:40,213
She didn't seem to have a clue

00:08:40,213 --> 00:08:41,814
about who her
daughter really was.

00:08:41,814 --> 00:08:43,583
Well, we may have something...

00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:45,852
I found a print on
the passenger-side door handle

00:08:45,852 --> 00:08:47,453
of the victim's car.

00:08:47,453 --> 00:08:49,655
It matches a set of prints
on this flyer.

00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:50,723
What are you thinking?

00:08:50,723 --> 00:08:52,491
Well, someone might've tried

00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:54,327
to break into the victim's car
last night.

00:08:54,327 --> 00:08:56,963
You know, guy goes around
putting flyers on windshields.

00:08:56,963 --> 00:08:58,631
<i>Gives him</i>
<i>the perfect opportunity</i>

00:08:58,631 --> 00:09:00,366
<i>to check inside for valuables.</i>

00:09:00,366 --> 00:09:02,235
<i>Well, I'm thinking</i>
<i>that he saw something</i>

00:09:02,235 --> 00:09:03,436
<i>inside the victim's car,</i>

00:09:03,436 --> 00:09:04,570
<i>because he tried the handle.</i>

00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:05,805
DEBBIE:
Hey! What're you doing?

00:09:05,805 --> 00:09:07,406
Get away from my car!

00:09:07,406 --> 00:09:09,876
(grunts)

00:09:09,876 --> 00:09:11,544
(Debbie screams)

00:09:13,246 --> 00:09:14,480
SANDERS:
Ernesto Peña.

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,948
Talked to your boss
at the diner.

00:09:15,948 --> 00:09:16,983
She said that
she pays you

00:09:16,983 --> 00:09:18,651
an extra $50 bucks a week

00:09:18,651 --> 00:09:20,853
to distribute flyers
after work each night.

00:09:20,853 --> 00:09:23,623
CRAWFORD:
That's not a bad way to make
a little extra scratch, huh?

00:09:23,623 --> 00:09:24,891
Every little bit
helps, you know?

00:09:24,891 --> 00:09:26,492
But you also found another way

00:09:26,492 --> 00:09:28,694
to make some extra scratch,
didn't you?

00:09:28,694 --> 00:09:29,762
You lost me, man.

00:09:29,762 --> 00:09:32,331
I don't know what you mean.

00:09:32,331 --> 00:09:34,533
CRAWFORD:
All of these were in
the trunk of your car.

00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:36,502
And my guess is,
when we search your apartment,

00:09:36,502 --> 00:09:38,471
we're gonna find
a whole lot more.

00:09:38,471 --> 00:09:40,339
SANDERS:
It's a big step though,

00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:42,341
going from breaking into cars

00:09:42,341 --> 00:09:43,509
to rape and murder.

00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:44,877
What are you
talking about, man?

00:09:44,877 --> 00:09:47,413
I never hurt
anybody.

00:09:47,413 --> 00:09:50,283
You did more than
just hurt her, Ernesto.

00:09:50,283 --> 00:09:51,884
Hell no, man!

00:09:51,884 --> 00:09:52,985
You got the wrong guy.

00:09:52,985 --> 00:09:54,353
I didn't do that.

00:09:54,353 --> 00:09:55,721
SANDERS:
You left your fingerprint

00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:56,722
on her car door handle

00:09:56,722 --> 00:09:57,823
and the flyer.

00:09:57,823 --> 00:09:58,958
That's how
we found you.

00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:00,660
And when your DNA
comes back a match

00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,695
to what we found on that girl...

00:10:05,665 --> 00:10:06,866
Fine.

00:10:06,866 --> 00:10:08,534
Fine, you want to test me?

00:10:08,534 --> 00:10:09,769
Test me!

00:10:09,769 --> 00:10:10,836
You'll see,
you're wrong.

00:10:12,305 --> 00:10:13,873
I did not
do that.

00:10:13,873 --> 00:10:15,975
I didn't even break into
any cars last night.

00:10:15,975 --> 00:10:17,576
Then why did we find
your fingerprint

00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:18,844
on her car door?

00:10:21,914 --> 00:10:24,417
I might've stopped at,
like, one place

00:10:24,417 --> 00:10:25,918
on the way home.

00:10:25,918 --> 00:10:27,219
All right?

00:10:27,219 --> 00:10:28,487
There were maybe
a dozen cars,

00:10:28,487 --> 00:10:29,889
but nothing in
there worth stealing,

00:10:29,889 --> 00:10:31,757
so I tossed
the flyers

00:10:31,757 --> 00:10:34,393
in a trash can
and went home, man.

00:10:34,393 --> 00:10:36,796
Please, man,
I'm telling you the truth.

00:10:39,298 --> 00:10:40,566
Okay, where is this place?

00:10:40,566 --> 00:10:41,934
Where was the girl's car?

00:10:41,934 --> 00:10:43,536
Some building, man,
off the highway, man,

00:10:43,536 --> 00:10:44,804
way out in Brime County.

00:10:44,804 --> 00:10:47,840
How about you tell us
exactly where?

00:11:12,531 --> 00:11:14,233
What is this place?

00:11:14,233 --> 00:11:16,202
I don't know.

00:11:16,202 --> 00:11:18,204
I don't see any signs.

00:11:18,204 --> 00:11:20,239
STOKES: Yeah, and I don't see
any restaurant flyers

00:11:20,239 --> 00:11:22,475
on any of these cars, either.

00:11:22,475 --> 00:11:23,776
Well,

00:11:23,776 --> 00:11:27,279
Ernesto said he left
most of the in the trash.

00:11:32,885 --> 00:11:34,520
No, empty.

00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,922
You know, maybe this guy
is just jerking us around.

00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,361
Then again,

00:11:42,361 --> 00:11:44,230
maybe he's not.

00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:50,369
Well, what do you think?

00:11:50,369 --> 00:11:51,570
Should we check it out?

00:11:56,442 --> 00:11:58,277
All right.

00:11:58,277 --> 00:11:59,211
(doorbell buzzes)

00:12:05,918 --> 00:12:07,586
You must be the Harris brothers?

00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:10,222
You're a little early.

00:12:10,222 --> 00:12:12,291
Yeah, well,
there was no traffic, so...

00:12:25,337 --> 00:12:26,605
I'll take you guys in.

00:12:26,605 --> 00:12:28,441
Suzanne will probably be
a couple of minutes,

00:12:28,441 --> 00:12:30,509
but you can get started
on your selections.

00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:39,652
There was a piece of this
in the victim's hair.

00:12:39,652 --> 00:12:40,653
She was here.

00:12:40,653 --> 00:12:44,623
(music playing softly)

00:12:44,623 --> 00:12:46,625
Now, I can take your drink
order whenever you like.

00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:48,861
Just let me know,
but in the meantime...

00:12:48,861 --> 00:12:50,463
(bell dings)

00:12:50,463 --> 00:12:52,331
...why don't you have
a look at your choices?

00:12:55,434 --> 00:12:56,969
(indistinct chatter)

00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,278
STOKES:
Well,

00:13:06,278 --> 00:13:07,847
so much
for our wholesome little girl.

00:13:09,315 --> 00:13:10,649
Teenage Bible Studies teacher

00:13:10,649 --> 00:13:12,651
spent her last night alive
in a brothel.

00:13:20,292 --> 00:13:22,461
(giggling, indistinct chatter)

00:13:24,597 --> 00:13:25,631
Hi, handsome.

00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,632
Sorry, ladies,

00:13:26,632 --> 00:13:27,633
but, uh,

00:13:27,633 --> 00:13:29,235
we're here on business.

00:13:29,235 --> 00:13:31,237
You know, we have
a law enforcement discount

00:13:31,237 --> 00:13:32,571
every day until 10:00.

00:13:32,571 --> 00:13:33,672
That's good to know,

00:13:33,672 --> 00:13:35,474
but, uh, not today.

00:13:35,474 --> 00:13:37,343
Oh, come on.

00:13:37,343 --> 00:13:38,978
You must see something here
that you're interested in.

00:13:38,978 --> 00:13:40,913
(door closes)

00:13:40,913 --> 00:13:42,681
We don't want to waste
your time, ladies.

00:13:42,681 --> 00:13:43,883
This isn't gonna happen.

00:13:45,384 --> 00:13:46,685
(sighs)
I'm serious.

00:13:46,685 --> 00:13:48,487
WOMAN:
You heard him, girls.

00:13:48,487 --> 00:13:50,556
(indistinct chatter)

00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,793
Gentlemen.

00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:56,562
Clearly,
you're not the Harris brothers.

00:13:56,562 --> 00:13:58,497
We're CSIs;
we're from Las Vegas.

00:13:58,497 --> 00:14:01,200
We have reason to believe
that there was a young girl here

00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,968
last night named Debbie.

00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:04,403
16 years old.

00:14:04,403 --> 00:14:06,539
This is a legal,
licensed brothel.

00:14:06,539 --> 00:14:08,240
Having a minor on the premises

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,642
would be against the law.

00:14:09,642 --> 00:14:11,610
I would never allow that.

00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,779
Would you mind taking
a look at her photo?

00:14:13,779 --> 00:14:14,713
Sure.

00:14:16,649 --> 00:14:17,950
She wasn't here.

00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:19,585
Don't suppose there are any,

00:14:19,585 --> 00:14:20,886
uh, security cameras
around here?

00:14:20,886 --> 00:14:22,288
Footage from last night

00:14:22,288 --> 00:14:23,989
that might back up your story?

00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:25,925
Cameras are bad for business.

00:14:25,925 --> 00:14:29,228
My customers
aren't breaking any laws.

00:14:29,228 --> 00:14:30,829
Doesn't mean they're not
breaking any vows,

00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:31,830
if you know what I mean.

00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,465
(chuckles)

00:14:33,465 --> 00:14:34,767
So, we'll just have
a look around?

00:14:34,767 --> 00:14:35,768
Absolutely.

00:14:38,804 --> 00:14:41,407
But under one condition.

00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:44,610
If you see anything
that excites you...

00:14:46,212 --> 00:14:47,279
...you let me know?

00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,414
Yes, ma'am.

00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,555
He's right there.
Oh.

00:15:01,427 --> 00:15:03,929
It's hard to imagine our
victim in this place.

00:15:03,929 --> 00:15:05,297
She seemed so innocent.

00:15:05,297 --> 00:15:06,532
Well, I guarantee you,

00:15:06,532 --> 00:15:08,334
every one of the girls
that we just met

00:15:08,334 --> 00:15:10,936
has a father at home
who'd tell you the same thing.

00:15:10,936 --> 00:15:12,404
(laughter)

00:15:15,674 --> 00:15:18,444
Oh, we'll wait on that one.

00:15:18,444 --> 00:15:20,479
Okay.

00:15:20,479 --> 00:15:21,480
We got, uh,

00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,782
the schoolroom,

00:15:23,782 --> 00:15:25,751
the red room...

00:15:25,751 --> 00:15:27,786
...Western room...

00:15:27,786 --> 00:15:29,255
...and, uh...

00:15:30,356 --> 00:15:31,890
...jungle room.

00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,659
Which do you prefer?

00:15:43,669 --> 00:15:45,904
(door creaking)

00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:08,427
Hey, Nick,

00:16:08,427 --> 00:16:09,461
come in here.

00:16:12,197 --> 00:16:13,499
So, the victim had

00:16:13,499 --> 00:16:15,301
antique glass in her knee.

00:16:15,301 --> 00:16:16,702
Dust void here.

00:16:16,702 --> 00:16:17,803
Bottle's missing.

00:16:17,803 --> 00:16:19,705
Mm-hmm.

00:16:30,816 --> 00:16:33,319
There's no broken glass
in the trash can.

00:16:39,658 --> 00:16:41,593
(glass shattering distantly)

00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:47,833
Well, I got some here,
and it's purple.

00:16:52,204 --> 00:16:53,238
(sniffs)

00:17:00,245 --> 00:17:02,915
Hey, I've got blood.

00:17:05,751 --> 00:17:07,820
(indistinct conversations)
MAN:
Everybody out!

00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:08,921
(shutter clicking)

00:17:08,921 --> 00:17:10,756
MADAM SUZANNE:
This is ridiculous.

00:17:10,756 --> 00:17:12,725
I told you,
this is a legal brothel.

00:17:12,725 --> 00:17:14,993
All of my girls are certified
and licensed.

00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:16,662
Except for the
16-year-olds, right?

00:17:16,662 --> 00:17:19,231
(scoffs) Watch your accusations,
Detective.

00:17:19,231 --> 00:17:20,933
I have friends in high places.
Oh, good.

00:17:20,933 --> 00:17:23,902
After we're done, you might want
to give one of them a call.

00:17:23,902 --> 00:17:25,771
I won't have to wait that long.
Roger, please!

00:17:25,771 --> 00:17:26,839
Do something!

00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:28,540
This way.

00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,641
Officer...

00:17:29,641 --> 00:17:30,743
No, no, Rog, Rog,

00:17:30,743 --> 00:17:32,378
that's gonna be okay.

00:17:32,378 --> 00:17:33,779
Uh, we're not gonna need
your help right now.

00:17:33,779 --> 00:17:35,381
I'm Roger Ridley.

00:17:35,381 --> 00:17:37,316
I'm Brine County Supervisor.

00:17:37,316 --> 00:17:39,918
And I know, Suzanne can come
off a little rough sometimes,

00:17:39,918 --> 00:17:42,421
but I'm here to tell you, this
place is 100% above board.

00:17:42,421 --> 00:17:45,491
And is that your
official position, Mr. Ridley?

00:17:45,491 --> 00:17:47,526
Or are you speaking
as a satisfied customer?

00:17:47,526 --> 00:17:49,695
(chuckles)
Both.

00:17:49,695 --> 00:17:51,930
I mean, I've known Suzanne
a long time.

00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:53,499
I helped her get this
place licensed.

00:17:53,499 --> 00:17:55,200
So I'm just asking
that you set aside

00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,669
some of these prejudices
against prostitution.

00:17:57,669 --> 00:17:58,904
It's just a business,

00:17:58,904 --> 00:18:00,773
like any other business.

00:18:00,773 --> 00:18:02,941
I'm not here because I have
a problem with prostitution.

00:18:02,941 --> 00:18:04,376
I'm here
because I have a problem

00:18:04,376 --> 00:18:05,878
with 16-year-old girls
being murdered.

00:18:09,948 --> 00:18:12,384
DEBBIE: Look what I made
with the Helping Homes Project.

00:18:13,652 --> 00:18:15,354
Not bad, right?

00:18:15,354 --> 00:18:17,623
You didn't think I could do it,
but this is, like,

00:18:17,623 --> 00:18:19,324
the third one of these houses
I've built.

00:18:19,324 --> 00:18:21,794
It's a lot of fun being
a Helping Homes volunteer.

00:18:21,794 --> 00:18:23,362
I guess if I flunk
out of school,

00:18:23,362 --> 00:18:25,197
I could always become
a construction worker.

00:18:25,197 --> 00:18:26,198
(laughs, computer beeps)

00:18:29,468 --> 00:18:30,469
What're you doing?

00:18:30,469 --> 00:18:31,970
I'm torturing myself.

00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:34,273
I'm going through the
victim's computer,

00:18:34,273 --> 00:18:35,441
looking at her e-mails

00:18:35,441 --> 00:18:37,209
and her Friend Agenda page.

00:18:37,209 --> 00:18:39,611
I'm just trying to figure out
how does a girl like her

00:18:39,611 --> 00:18:41,880
end up in a brothel
and then dead

00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,983
in a car on the side
of the road?

00:18:44,983 --> 00:18:48,454
Everything about her is
so positive and wholesome.

00:18:52,524 --> 00:18:54,226
You know, Detective Crawford is

00:18:54,226 --> 00:18:55,694
about to bring
the brothel owner in.

00:18:55,694 --> 00:18:57,596
Maybe you want to be there.

00:18:57,596 --> 00:18:58,764
Okay.

00:19:01,533 --> 00:19:04,336
(door opens)

00:19:04,336 --> 00:19:07,406
Mm, brought a woman
with you, huh, Detective?

00:19:07,406 --> 00:19:08,574
Is that so us gals

00:19:08,574 --> 00:19:11,410
can... relate?

00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:13,378
Oh, I doubt we have much
in common.

00:19:13,378 --> 00:19:15,514
Sex business
make you uncomfortable?

00:19:15,514 --> 00:19:17,483
No, trafficking in young girls

00:19:17,483 --> 00:19:19,718
does do something bad
to my stomach.

00:19:19,718 --> 00:19:21,587
(chuckles)

00:19:21,587 --> 00:19:23,856
What kind of person
do you think I am?

00:19:23,856 --> 00:19:25,457
CRAWFORD: We have DNA
proof that Debbie Logan

00:19:25,457 --> 00:19:26,925
was in your brothel.

00:19:26,925 --> 00:19:29,528
Then she turns up dead,
having been sexually assaulted.

00:19:29,528 --> 00:19:31,363
You want us to believe
there's no connection?

00:19:31,363 --> 00:19:33,665
I run a legal business.

00:19:33,665 --> 00:19:35,400
Yes, you do run a business.

00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,602
You like to make money, right?

00:19:37,936 --> 00:19:39,571
So let's say a client comes in

00:19:39,571 --> 00:19:41,740
and offers you
a whole lot of money,

00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:42,975
but he likes them young,

00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:44,877
and you're someone
who always delivers,

00:19:44,877 --> 00:19:48,447
so you deliver Debbie Logan.

00:19:48,447 --> 00:19:49,715
CRAWFORD:
We already have enough

00:19:49,715 --> 00:19:51,884
to shut you down.

00:19:51,884 --> 00:19:53,519
If you know who killed
that girl,

00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:55,621
it's a good time to talk.

00:19:55,621 --> 00:19:56,989
Unless you want us to hang

00:19:56,989 --> 00:19:58,790
a murder charge
on you as well.

00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,796
I don't know who killed her.

00:20:04,796 --> 00:20:08,200
She was dead the first time
I laid eyes on her.

00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,969
My bartender, Rex,
he found her.

00:20:10,969 --> 00:20:12,938
Suzanne,
there's a girl outside.

00:20:12,938 --> 00:20:14,873
I think she's dead.
What? Where?

00:20:14,873 --> 00:20:18,277
<i>She was outside</i>
<i>in the parking lot.</i>

00:20:20,212 --> 00:20:23,682
I don't know anything about her
being inside the brothel.

00:20:23,682 --> 00:20:24,983
That is the one and only time

00:20:24,983 --> 00:20:26,618
I saw her.

00:20:33,825 --> 00:20:36,695
So, um, this is the spot.

00:20:36,695 --> 00:20:37,963
She was right here
next to her car.

00:20:37,963 --> 00:20:39,464
I-I didn't see her

00:20:39,464 --> 00:20:41,266
until after I threw
the trash in the Dumpster

00:20:41,266 --> 00:20:42,768
and was headed back inside.

00:20:42,768 --> 00:20:45,237
Why didn't you
call it in, man?

00:20:45,237 --> 00:20:46,438
What the hell is
wrong with you?

00:20:46,438 --> 00:20:48,307
I went and told Madam Suzanne.

00:20:48,307 --> 00:20:50,576
I thought she'd call it in.
But she didn't.

00:20:50,576 --> 00:20:53,211
No, she told me to get rid
of the body, just get it

00:20:53,211 --> 00:20:54,513
anywhere away from here.

00:20:54,513 --> 00:20:57,516
So that's what I did.

00:20:57,516 --> 00:20:59,585
<i>I found her keys in her purse</i>

00:20:59,585 --> 00:21:00,986
<i>and I put her in the car.</i>

00:21:00,986 --> 00:21:03,522
<i>I did what I could</i>
<i>to cover up the blood,</i>

00:21:03,522 --> 00:21:05,490
<i>so no one would know,</i>

00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:07,926
<i>and then I got her</i>
<i>the hell out of here,</i>

00:21:07,926 --> 00:21:10,462
<i>away from the brothel.</i>

00:21:10,462 --> 00:21:13,265
I drove her up the highway,
parked the car

00:21:13,265 --> 00:21:14,833
and... and hitched back.

00:21:20,906 --> 00:21:22,608
You're an idiot.

00:21:22,608 --> 00:21:23,609
You know that?

00:21:23,609 --> 00:21:25,243
Come on, I...

00:21:25,243 --> 00:21:26,912
I didn't try to hide her.

00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:29,548
I... I put her where I knew
she'd be found.

00:21:31,984 --> 00:21:34,786
(sirens wailing)

00:21:50,969 --> 00:21:53,271
HODGES:
Blood, yours.

00:21:53,271 --> 00:21:54,606
Cigarette butt, mine.

00:21:56,675 --> 00:21:57,643
Oh.

00:21:59,544 --> 00:22:02,981
A 1926 penny.

00:22:02,981 --> 00:22:04,716
That's got to be
worth something by now.

00:22:04,716 --> 00:22:05,917
I'm sure it's
probably doubled

00:22:05,917 --> 00:22:07,619
or even tripled in value
since then.

00:22:09,588 --> 00:22:12,424
Hey, you know, there's a rumor
going around the office

00:22:12,424 --> 00:22:14,259
that you visited a brothel once.

00:22:14,259 --> 00:22:15,627
Is that true?

00:22:15,627 --> 00:22:17,396
Many, many years ago.

00:22:17,396 --> 00:22:20,465
It's a long story,
and not one with a happy ending.

00:22:22,267 --> 00:22:24,569
No pun intended.

00:22:24,569 --> 00:22:25,904
Aha.

00:22:25,904 --> 00:22:27,806
I will see your two
cigarette butts,

00:22:27,806 --> 00:22:29,307
rusty pull tab
and penny,

00:22:29,307 --> 00:22:32,744
and raise you one
piece of turquoise.

00:22:32,744 --> 00:22:34,413
Don't say I never
gave you anything.

00:22:36,782 --> 00:22:38,417
So I talked to the girls.

00:22:38,417 --> 00:22:40,352
Several of them said
that the bartender

00:22:40,352 --> 00:22:41,553
was only outside for a minute--

00:22:41,553 --> 00:22:43,355
long enough to dump out
the trash--

00:22:43,355 --> 00:22:46,224
then he came running back in,
looking for Madam Suzanne.

00:22:46,224 --> 00:22:48,360
So if we believe the girls,
Rex isn't the killer.

00:22:49,928 --> 00:22:52,564
Well, we still need to
find the murder weapon.

00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,607
STOKES:
Hey, check this out.

00:23:04,209 --> 00:23:05,544
Shoe impression.

00:23:05,544 --> 00:23:06,978
Looks fairly fresh.

00:23:06,978 --> 00:23:09,748
Pointed, like the toe
of a boot.

00:23:09,748 --> 00:23:11,950
Or a high-heel.
Plenty of those in there.

00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:15,787
Ah.

00:23:17,322 --> 00:23:19,357
Or...

00:23:19,357 --> 00:23:22,627
the killer left it behind when
they were getting rid of this.

00:23:22,627 --> 00:23:24,463
Consistent with the
victim's head wound.

00:23:27,199 --> 00:23:28,934
♪ ♪

00:23:48,887 --> 00:23:51,590
Only thing harder than
getting blood from a stone

00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:53,325
is getting fingerprints.

00:23:53,325 --> 00:23:54,426
Nothing there?

00:23:54,426 --> 00:23:55,527
Nothing usable.

00:23:55,527 --> 00:23:56,728
Too smudged.

00:23:56,728 --> 00:23:59,531
Killer probably was
wearing gloves.

00:23:59,531 --> 00:24:02,534
You still running the prints
from the brothel?

00:24:02,534 --> 00:24:05,537
Yep. I already processed
about a hundred lifts.

00:24:05,537 --> 00:24:08,240
Probably have at least
that many still to go.

00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,308
Brothel turns out to be
quite the popular place.

00:24:10,308 --> 00:24:11,543
What a surprise.

00:24:11,543 --> 00:24:12,978
Interesting clientele, too.

00:24:12,978 --> 00:24:15,247
I've already had
two city councilmen,

00:24:15,247 --> 00:24:16,481
a former child actor

00:24:16,481 --> 00:24:18,617
and an over-the-hill
rock star.

00:24:18,617 --> 00:24:20,919
(computer beeping)

00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:23,555
That's interesting. One of
the prints from the brothel,

00:24:23,555 --> 00:24:25,690
the Western Room-- it's a match

00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:27,592
to one of the exemplar
prints we collected

00:24:27,592 --> 00:24:29,394
before processing
the victim's car.

00:24:29,394 --> 00:24:30,695
You got a name?

00:24:30,695 --> 00:24:32,631
Let's see.

00:24:36,301 --> 00:24:37,836
That's the girl's father.

00:24:37,836 --> 00:24:40,272
His prints are all over
the brothel.

00:24:40,272 --> 00:24:41,306
He was there.

00:24:44,843 --> 00:24:47,379
RUSSELL: It's almost
a cliché at this point--

00:24:47,379 --> 00:24:51,249
a revered man of the cloth
indulging in carnal escapades.

00:24:51,249 --> 00:24:52,984
I checked with
your secretary, Mr. Logan.

00:24:52,984 --> 00:24:54,419
You clear your schedule

00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:56,421
for "personal reasons"
every Tuesday night.

00:24:56,421 --> 00:24:58,557
Right about the same time,
your bank records show

00:24:58,557 --> 00:25:01,593
you withdrawing $500 cash--
week in and week out.

00:25:01,593 --> 00:25:03,328
Kind of brothel regular,
aren't you?

00:25:03,328 --> 00:25:05,397
There's nothing illegal
about my going there.

00:25:05,397 --> 00:25:07,299
A bit hypocritical though,
don't you think?

00:25:07,299 --> 00:25:08,900
What happens there
is between me and God.

00:25:11,736 --> 00:25:13,572
You're missing the point,
Mr. Logan.

00:25:13,572 --> 00:25:16,741
We don't really care what
goes on between you and God.

00:25:16,741 --> 00:25:18,310
Or you and
your favorite hooker,

00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:19,811
for that matter.

00:25:19,811 --> 00:25:22,514
Our problem is: you frequent
the very same brothel

00:25:22,514 --> 00:25:24,416
where your daughter was killed

00:25:24,416 --> 00:25:25,417
two nights ago.

00:25:25,417 --> 00:25:27,853
That's our problem.

00:25:27,853 --> 00:25:29,421
Wait a minute.

00:25:29,421 --> 00:25:31,690
Debbie was at the brothel?

00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:32,924
CRAWFORD:
Don't act surprised.

00:25:32,924 --> 00:25:33,925
We don't buy it.

00:25:33,925 --> 00:25:35,393
You can't think I had

00:25:35,393 --> 00:25:36,728
something to do with
Debbie's death?

00:25:36,728 --> 00:25:37,896
No, I'll tell you what I think.

00:25:37,896 --> 00:25:39,331
I think Debbie figured out

00:25:39,331 --> 00:25:41,833
what your Tuesday nights
are all about.

00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:44,236
<i>She caught you in the act.</i>

00:25:44,236 --> 00:25:45,770
Daddy, how could you?

00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:47,973
We have to talk.

00:25:47,973 --> 00:25:49,641
You are a hypocrite!
Listen to me!

00:25:49,641 --> 00:25:50,742
Everything you are is a lie!

00:25:50,742 --> 00:25:52,644
This has to only
be our secret!

00:25:52,644 --> 00:25:53,879
No, no, listen to me!

00:25:53,879 --> 00:25:56,381
(grunts)

00:25:56,381 --> 00:25:58,283
Fight started
in the Western Room.

00:25:58,283 --> 00:25:59,551
That's where Debbie
cut her knee.

00:25:59,551 --> 00:26:01,253
At some point,
she ran outside.

00:26:01,253 --> 00:26:02,654
I'm guessing
you followed her out there

00:26:02,654 --> 00:26:03,989
'cause you knew
you had to stop her.

00:26:05,657 --> 00:26:08,460
Debbie, if you tell,
I'll lose the church.

00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:09,895
I'll lose everything.

00:26:09,895 --> 00:26:12,264
And your mother-- you really
want to hurt her like that?!

00:26:12,264 --> 00:26:14,599
Don't even talk to me!
You should've thought of that.

00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:16,234
Don't you walk away from me!

00:26:20,505 --> 00:26:24,309
I don't know what
sick twisted world you live in.

00:26:24,309 --> 00:26:27,812
But I could never, ever,
lay a hand on my daughter.

00:26:30,448 --> 00:26:31,816
You don't have to take
my word for it.

00:26:31,816 --> 00:26:33,718
I wasn't at the brothel
Tuesday night.

00:26:33,718 --> 00:26:35,787
There was an emergency.

00:26:35,787 --> 00:26:37,255
One of my parishioners died,

00:26:37,255 --> 00:26:39,257
and I was ministering
to that family

00:26:39,257 --> 00:26:40,525
all night.

00:26:40,525 --> 00:26:41,960
This is their number.

00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,862
You call and check
if you don't believe me.

00:26:51,503 --> 00:26:53,471
Okay, so we're only testing
shoes and boots

00:26:53,471 --> 00:26:55,340
with pointed toes.

00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:58,743
Okay, so sneakers, anything with
a round toe, we don't need.

00:26:58,743 --> 00:27:00,578
This is such
a waste of time.

00:27:00,578 --> 00:27:03,381
Can't Prince Charming here
just test the shoes on his own?

00:27:03,381 --> 00:27:04,716
Why do we have to be here?

00:27:04,716 --> 00:27:06,351
Because the impression
will be different

00:27:06,351 --> 00:27:07,552
with the weight of your foot

00:27:07,552 --> 00:27:09,654
inside of the shoe
pressing down.

00:27:09,654 --> 00:27:11,756
Okay.

00:27:13,858 --> 00:27:15,460
Uh...

00:27:16,795 --> 00:27:19,397
Actually, I only need
the right one.

00:27:23,268 --> 00:27:24,436
You can have a seat.

00:27:30,542 --> 00:27:31,876
Okay, stand up.

00:27:32,944 --> 00:27:34,512
Try to stand still.

00:27:34,512 --> 00:27:36,281
All right, now lift up.

00:27:36,281 --> 00:27:39,417
Great. Take your shoes off
and just leave them right there.

00:28:01,906 --> 00:28:02,941
Hey, Finn.

00:28:02,941 --> 00:28:04,743
Yeah?

00:28:04,743 --> 00:28:06,711
Take a look at this.

00:28:06,711 --> 00:28:08,713
There's glass
stuck in the sole.

00:28:08,713 --> 00:28:11,449
That looks a lot like the glass
we found in the victim's knee.

00:28:11,449 --> 00:28:13,651
You know, when I interviewed
the girls earlier,

00:28:13,651 --> 00:28:15,286
Kirsten said that she had never

00:28:15,286 --> 00:28:17,522
been in the
Western Room.

00:28:20,625 --> 00:28:22,527
<i>You lied to me.</i>

00:28:22,527 --> 00:28:25,497
You told me that you had never
been in the Western Room.

00:28:25,497 --> 00:28:26,831
That's not true, is it?

00:28:26,831 --> 00:28:28,633
Wow, a hooker
who can't be trusted.

00:28:28,633 --> 00:28:30,268
Shocking, right?

00:28:30,268 --> 00:28:31,903
I don't think this is
something to joke about.

00:28:31,903 --> 00:28:33,872
Who's joking?

00:28:33,872 --> 00:28:35,774
I know about
your two drug busts.

00:28:35,774 --> 00:28:38,343
It'd be really easy for me
to make a call right now

00:28:38,343 --> 00:28:40,512
and have your
prostitution license revoked.

00:28:40,512 --> 00:28:41,880
Unless you have
some other job skills

00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,881
that I don't know about...

00:28:42,881 --> 00:28:43,882
Fine, all right?

00:28:43,882 --> 00:28:46,751
I saw her.

00:28:46,751 --> 00:28:48,586
She showed up at the back
door, and I let her in.

00:28:48,586 --> 00:28:49,988
I put her in
the Western Room

00:28:49,988 --> 00:28:51,823
so that Madam Suzanne
wouldn't see her.

00:28:51,823 --> 00:28:54,526
She'd blow a boob if she
saw a kid in this place.

00:28:54,526 --> 00:28:55,827
Why was she here?

00:28:55,827 --> 00:28:57,195
I don't know.

00:28:57,195 --> 00:28:58,830
We get girls like her sometimes.

00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:00,865
Runaways usually.

00:29:00,865 --> 00:29:02,667
They think the glamorous
life of prostitution

00:29:02,667 --> 00:29:04,202
is gonna be the answer.

00:29:04,202 --> 00:29:05,603
Well, she wasn't a runaway.

00:29:05,603 --> 00:29:07,505
Whatever.

00:29:07,505 --> 00:29:09,908
Told her she didn't
belong here.

00:29:09,908 --> 00:29:13,478
And when she broke that bottle,
I showed her to the door.

00:29:13,478 --> 00:29:15,713
That was the last
time I saw her.

00:29:15,713 --> 00:29:17,882
Wow, that's the lamest lie
I've ever heard.

00:29:20,919 --> 00:29:23,488
Do you know that girl
was only 16 years old?

00:29:26,591 --> 00:29:28,326
Someone raped
and assaulted her,

00:29:28,326 --> 00:29:32,597
and then beat her
over the head with a rock.

00:29:32,597 --> 00:29:34,265
So, I don't know
what your life was like

00:29:34,265 --> 00:29:35,767
or what was done to you,

00:29:35,767 --> 00:29:37,902
but nobody deserves
to have that happen to them.

00:29:37,902 --> 00:29:39,804
(door opens)

00:29:39,804 --> 00:29:42,440
LOGAN:
Kirsten!

00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,242
Don't say another word.

00:29:44,242 --> 00:29:45,610
FINLAY:
What are you doing here?

00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:46,678
I called an attorney.

00:29:46,678 --> 00:29:47,812
She doesn't have to talk to you.

00:29:54,752 --> 00:29:55,720
I guess we're done here.

00:29:58,857 --> 00:29:59,891
Kirsten.

00:30:03,261 --> 00:30:04,896
Saved her from
a confession.

00:30:04,896 --> 00:30:06,698
Not even a "thank you."

00:30:06,698 --> 00:30:07,699
You ever wonder

00:30:07,699 --> 00:30:09,467
why you even bother?

00:30:09,467 --> 00:30:11,936
I mean, are you gonna pay
for her attorney, too?

00:30:11,936 --> 00:30:13,605
If I have to.

00:30:13,605 --> 00:30:15,640
Why would you do that?

00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,275
Well, because
he's in love with her.

00:30:17,275 --> 00:30:19,611
She's Miss Tuesday Night,
isn't she?

00:30:22,547 --> 00:30:24,249
She's my daughter.

00:30:26,351 --> 00:30:29,454
But we thought that Debbie was
an only child.

00:30:29,454 --> 00:30:31,689
No. She had a sister.

00:30:31,689 --> 00:30:33,558
Kirsten was 17
when she ran away.

00:30:33,558 --> 00:30:35,727
We've been estranged ever since.

00:30:35,727 --> 00:30:38,229
So you coming here
every Tuesday night...

00:30:38,229 --> 00:30:40,632
It's the only chance
I get to talk to her.

00:30:40,632 --> 00:30:42,600
I have to pay for her time,
just like anyone else.

00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,536
At $500 a week?

00:30:44,536 --> 00:30:46,638
$500 is nothing
for the chance

00:30:46,638 --> 00:30:49,974
to sit down and talk
to my daughter.

00:30:49,974 --> 00:30:53,511
I have never
given up on her.

00:30:53,511 --> 00:30:56,714
And I'm never gonna
give up on her.

00:30:56,714 --> 00:30:58,683
Mr. Logan,

00:30:58,683 --> 00:31:01,319
we have reason to believe
that Kirsten may have been

00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:03,521
involved with Debbie's murder.

00:31:03,521 --> 00:31:05,990
Then you better
get the evidence.

00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:09,394
'Cause I'm gonna make sure she
has the best defense available.

00:31:12,864 --> 00:31:14,832
So our preacher
has two daughters, right?

00:31:14,832 --> 00:31:16,568
One a hooker, the other,

00:31:16,568 --> 00:31:18,536
as far as we can tell,
practically an angel.

00:31:18,536 --> 00:31:19,938
Okay? All right?

00:31:19,938 --> 00:31:22,273
So let's say that
Kirsten is our killer.

00:31:22,273 --> 00:31:23,908
What's her motive?

00:31:23,908 --> 00:31:24,976
Jealously, right?

00:31:24,976 --> 00:31:26,244
Yeah.

00:31:26,244 --> 00:31:28,613
Kirsten's stuck being a hooker,

00:31:28,613 --> 00:31:31,249
paying the bills on her back,
while her little sister is

00:31:31,249 --> 00:31:33,351
at home being treated
like a princess.

00:31:33,351 --> 00:31:35,286
Mom has written her off
completely.

00:31:35,286 --> 00:31:36,888
Dad still pays a weekly visit,

00:31:36,888 --> 00:31:38,856
but he probably just
preaches at her,

00:31:38,856 --> 00:31:41,960
tells her she should be more
like her little sister, right?

00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,895
Yeah, that could make her snap.
Right.

00:31:43,895 --> 00:31:45,630
Cracks a rock
over Debbie's head.

00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:47,632
ANDREWS:
Hey, D.B.?

00:31:47,632 --> 00:31:49,300
Well, I've been
working on an I.D.

00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,436
for the guy who sexually
assaulted our victim.

00:31:51,436 --> 00:31:53,471
I don't have a name yet,
but I was processing

00:31:53,471 --> 00:31:56,341
DNA samples brought in from the
brothel, and I found a match.

00:31:56,341 --> 00:31:58,343
Specifically, to
DNA on bedsheets

00:31:58,343 --> 00:31:59,611
that came from the Asian Room.

00:31:59,611 --> 00:32:02,580
So the last customer
in the Asian Room...

00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,982
Same person
who raped Debbie Logan.

00:32:09,887 --> 00:32:12,624
So I met this bozo
at the brothel;

00:32:12,624 --> 00:32:14,392
he's a friend of the madam's.

00:32:14,392 --> 00:32:15,627
(people chattering urgently)

00:32:15,627 --> 00:32:17,362
MAN: Close the door!
Close the door!

00:32:17,362 --> 00:32:19,897
Run! Call the cops!

00:32:19,897 --> 00:32:21,332
WOMAN:
Help!

00:32:21,332 --> 00:32:22,900
Somebody call 911!
He's got a gun!

00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:23,935
Who's got a gun? Ridley?

00:32:23,935 --> 00:32:24,936
No, no. The reverend.

00:32:24,936 --> 00:32:26,437
He's gonna kill him!

00:32:26,437 --> 00:32:27,805
MAN: Move! Let's go!
Everybody clear out!

00:32:27,805 --> 00:32:28,806
Hurry up!
Come on, you guys!

00:32:28,806 --> 00:32:29,807
LOGAN:
Bastard.

00:32:29,807 --> 00:32:30,942
How could you do that

00:32:30,942 --> 00:32:32,410
to a little girl?

00:32:33,645 --> 00:32:35,647
To my baby?!

00:32:35,647 --> 00:32:37,282
Mr. Logan, drop the gun.

00:32:37,282 --> 00:32:38,583
He has to die.

00:32:41,419 --> 00:32:44,789
I have to kill him for
what he did to Debbie!

00:32:51,296 --> 00:32:53,698
Come on, now, Jim.
You can't do this.

00:32:53,698 --> 00:32:57,201
He raped and killed
my little girl.

00:32:57,201 --> 00:32:58,770
For God's sake,
I did nothing of the sort.

00:32:58,770 --> 00:32:59,837
Stop lying!

00:32:59,837 --> 00:33:01,472
Look, there's the proof.

00:33:01,472 --> 00:33:02,874
She fought for her life.
STOKES: Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:33:02,874 --> 00:33:04,575
Listen to me, now.

00:33:04,575 --> 00:33:06,678
Now, you know this is wrong.
How is this wrong?

00:33:06,678 --> 00:33:08,646
He deserves it!
CRAWFORD:
No doubt he does,

00:33:08,646 --> 00:33:09,914
but let us deal with it, okay?

00:33:09,914 --> 00:33:11,716
Not you.

00:33:11,716 --> 00:33:13,384
No...
(cocks gun)

00:33:13,384 --> 00:33:14,419
I have to do this.

00:33:14,419 --> 00:33:17,388
Hey! Hey! Listen...

00:33:17,388 --> 00:33:19,991
Now, I can't quote
any scripture...

00:33:19,991 --> 00:33:23,261
yeah, I don't have any
godly words for you...

00:33:23,261 --> 00:33:25,863
but I do know this:
If you shoot him,

00:33:25,863 --> 00:33:27,565
Detective Crawford,
right behind you,

00:33:27,565 --> 00:33:30,768
is gonna pop you right
in the back of the head.

00:33:30,768 --> 00:33:33,571
Man, nobody wants that.

00:33:33,571 --> 00:33:34,639
So how about...

00:33:38,443 --> 00:33:41,312
...I reach up and I take
that gun from you...

00:33:42,613 --> 00:33:43,648
(shudders)

00:33:46,317 --> 00:33:47,385
All right?

00:33:51,489 --> 00:33:52,557
Nice and easy.

00:33:58,329 --> 00:34:00,231
Good man.

00:34:02,467 --> 00:34:05,403
For God's sake,
you should've shot him.

00:34:05,403 --> 00:34:06,971
Shut up, fool.

00:34:06,971 --> 00:34:09,874
(siren approaching)

00:34:09,874 --> 00:34:11,275
Don't you even move.

00:34:12,777 --> 00:34:15,213
He did those things I said.

00:34:15,213 --> 00:34:16,247
He's the one responsible.

00:34:16,247 --> 00:34:17,415
We know.

00:34:17,415 --> 00:34:18,416
But how'd you find out?

00:34:18,416 --> 00:34:19,884
Kirsten told me.

00:34:19,884 --> 00:34:21,619
Debbie explained everything
to her the other night.

00:34:21,619 --> 00:34:23,488
Is that why Debbie
went to the brothel?

00:34:23,488 --> 00:34:24,689
She was looking
for her sister?

00:34:24,689 --> 00:34:26,791
No, no, no,
she was there to see me.

00:34:26,791 --> 00:34:28,359
She thought I was there
with Kirsten.

00:34:28,359 --> 00:34:30,695
She was upset and
she wanted to...

00:34:30,695 --> 00:34:33,831
tell me what that piece of crap
had done-- how he raped her.

00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,702
OFFICER: Excuse me.
Out of the way, please.

00:34:37,702 --> 00:34:38,736
You can put those away.

00:34:38,736 --> 00:34:40,738
We're all Code Four here.

00:34:40,738 --> 00:34:41,973
It's okay, Jim.

00:34:41,973 --> 00:34:43,708
Give this man
a set of bracelets,

00:34:43,708 --> 00:34:45,209
and walk him out
to the car for me.

00:34:45,209 --> 00:34:46,944
But sit on him for
a few minutes, okay?

00:34:46,944 --> 00:34:48,713
He's gonna be riding
back with me.

00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:54,385
Boy, I hope you guys
are smart enough

00:34:54,385 --> 00:34:55,987
to realize he's delusional.

00:34:55,987 --> 00:34:58,256
It must be, uh,
just the grief or something.

00:34:58,256 --> 00:35:00,525
I tell you what: we'll take
a look at the evidence.

00:35:00,525 --> 00:35:01,826
We'll draw our own conclusions.

00:35:01,826 --> 00:35:03,828
Eh, that's the ladies
at the brothel--

00:35:03,828 --> 00:35:04,829
they don't hold back.

00:35:04,829 --> 00:35:06,864
Yeah.
You know what I mean.

00:35:06,864 --> 00:35:07,899
Sure.

00:35:07,899 --> 00:35:09,267
Open up.

00:35:09,267 --> 00:35:10,268
Pardon me?

00:35:10,268 --> 00:35:12,437
Your mouth. Open it.

00:35:12,437 --> 00:35:15,206
(scoffs)
CRAWFORD: You know what this
is gonna reveal, right?

00:35:15,206 --> 00:35:17,241
That you raped
a 16 year old.

00:35:17,241 --> 00:35:18,443
Rape?!

00:35:18,443 --> 00:35:19,911
There wasn't any rape!

00:35:19,911 --> 00:35:23,214
If anything happened,
it was consensual.

00:35:23,214 --> 00:35:24,916
And, for the record,
I thought she was 18.

00:35:24,916 --> 00:35:27,351
You knew she wasn't.

00:35:27,351 --> 00:35:28,953
That's why you killed her;
to keep her quiet.

00:35:28,953 --> 00:35:31,522
Come on!
You guys are way off base here.

00:35:31,522 --> 00:35:33,291
For starters,
let's not paint this girl

00:35:33,291 --> 00:35:34,492
like some kind of angel.

00:35:34,492 --> 00:35:35,693
She wasn't no virgin.

00:35:35,693 --> 00:35:37,295
You know that's a lie.

00:35:37,295 --> 00:35:38,429
She got paid for it.

00:35:38,429 --> 00:35:39,864
If you don't believe me,

00:35:39,864 --> 00:35:41,766
why don't you go ask
the woman who pimped her out?

00:35:41,766 --> 00:35:43,401
CRAWFORD:
What are you talking about?

00:35:43,401 --> 00:35:44,402
This Madam Suzanne?

00:35:44,402 --> 00:35:45,703
Not Suzanne; I told you--

00:35:45,703 --> 00:35:47,538
Suzanne's on the up and up.

00:35:47,538 --> 00:35:49,540
Okay, then who the hell
are you talking about?

00:35:53,945 --> 00:35:56,681
Can somebody please tell me
what I am doing here?

00:35:56,681 --> 00:35:59,550
I'm supposed to be at
a memorial service for
my daughter right now.

00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:01,586
This is... unconscionable.

00:36:01,586 --> 00:36:04,489
Mrs. Logan,
we've been talking with a...

00:36:04,489 --> 00:36:06,224
an acquaintance of yours--

00:36:06,224 --> 00:36:08,826
Brime County Supervisor
Roger Ridley.

00:36:08,826 --> 00:36:11,229
He's downstairs in a holding
cell, as a matter of fact.

00:36:11,229 --> 00:36:12,930
FINLAY: He signed
a sworn statement

00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:16,667
saying that he paid you
$1,200 and, in return,

00:36:16,667 --> 00:36:21,339
you arranged for him to have sex
with your daughter Debbie.

00:36:21,339 --> 00:36:23,407
That's disgusting.

00:36:23,407 --> 00:36:25,343
That is a horrible
thing to say!

00:36:25,343 --> 00:36:26,844
Why do you think
he said it, then?

00:36:26,844 --> 00:36:28,779
I have no idea.

00:36:28,779 --> 00:36:31,415
I... I-I don't know.

00:36:31,415 --> 00:36:33,818
I... my husband and I were
pretty vocal

00:36:33,818 --> 00:36:36,787
opposing Mr. Ridley's
election last year.

00:36:36,787 --> 00:36:38,422
I-I-I can only think
that he's trying

00:36:38,422 --> 00:36:39,590
to get back at us somehow?

00:36:43,394 --> 00:36:45,596
I mean, you're not gonna
take the word of a...

00:36:45,596 --> 00:36:47,498
of a dirty, horny
pedophile over...

00:36:48,666 --> 00:36:51,335
...mine, a preacher's wife.

00:36:51,335 --> 00:36:53,704
Well, you weren't always a
preacher's wife, were you?

00:36:53,704 --> 00:36:56,874
These are LVPD
arrest reports,

00:36:56,874 --> 00:37:00,878
one from 1989
and two from 1990.

00:37:00,878 --> 00:37:04,282
Solicitation
for prostitution.

00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:10,521
Okay.

00:37:10,521 --> 00:37:11,589
So what?

00:37:13,558 --> 00:37:14,559
I was a prostitute.

00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:15,960
It was a long time ago.

00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,428
RUSSELL:
You were young.

00:37:17,428 --> 00:37:19,397
You were really young.

00:37:19,397 --> 00:37:21,299
But then your husband came along

00:37:21,299 --> 00:37:23,367
and rescued you.

00:37:23,367 --> 00:37:24,402
(mocking laughter)

00:37:24,402 --> 00:37:26,270
"Rescued me."

00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:28,606
That's funny, actually.

00:37:28,606 --> 00:37:30,241
You ever know
one of those people--

00:37:30,241 --> 00:37:32,310
someone who rescues
lots of animals?

00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:34,478
Then you see them with their
pets, later, and you realize

00:37:34,478 --> 00:37:36,247
they don't give a damn
about the animals.

00:37:36,247 --> 00:37:37,582
They just want the whole world

00:37:37,582 --> 00:37:38,816
to think
they're someone special.

00:37:41,252 --> 00:37:42,954
That's Jim.

00:37:42,954 --> 00:37:45,823
All his charity,
all of his missionary work,

00:37:45,823 --> 00:37:48,893
the hours and hours he spends
helping out his parishioners...

00:37:48,893 --> 00:37:51,195
So you don't think
that was genuine.

00:37:51,195 --> 00:37:52,964
He just wants everyone
to think he's a great guy.

00:37:52,964 --> 00:37:54,565
Gets off on
the pats on his back.

00:37:54,565 --> 00:37:55,866
Well, he obviously
helped you

00:37:55,866 --> 00:37:57,368
turn your life around.

00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:01,739
You sound just like
all the rest of them.

00:38:01,739 --> 00:38:05,242
I should be so lucky
to have him.

00:38:05,242 --> 00:38:07,612
My life before Jim
was just fine.

00:38:07,612 --> 00:38:09,747
Being a prostitute,
you mean.

00:38:09,747 --> 00:38:12,850
Good enough for you, good enough
for your daughters, right?

00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:14,852
FINLAY:
How old was Kirsten

00:38:14,852 --> 00:38:17,254
when you first started
pimping her out?

00:38:17,254 --> 00:38:18,255
Fifteen?

00:38:18,255 --> 00:38:19,423
Yeah, how old was she?

00:38:19,423 --> 00:38:23,260
When I was 15, I was working.

00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:26,530
Mm-hmm. I guess Kirsten was
too scared to run to her dad.

00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:27,865
Kept her mouth shut.

00:38:27,865 --> 00:38:29,567
Too bad Debbie
couldn't do the same.

00:38:29,567 --> 00:38:32,703
After she was raped by
Supervisor Ridley,

00:38:32,703 --> 00:38:36,273
she ran to the brothel to tell
her father what had happened,

00:38:36,273 --> 00:38:38,442
and tell him what
you had been doing.

00:38:38,442 --> 00:38:40,678
RUSSELL: Yeah, lucky for you,
he wasn't there.

00:38:40,678 --> 00:38:41,812
But you were.

00:38:41,812 --> 00:38:43,247
<i>You were waiting outside...</i>

00:38:43,247 --> 00:38:44,448
Mom...?
Oh, you bitch!

00:38:44,448 --> 00:38:45,883
You think you're
better than Kirsten!

00:38:45,883 --> 00:38:47,485
You think you're
better than me!

00:38:53,424 --> 00:38:55,226
This is all a lie.

00:38:55,226 --> 00:38:56,594
You can't prove
any of this.

00:38:56,594 --> 00:38:58,195
FINLAY:
Oh, yes, we can.

00:38:58,195 --> 00:39:00,665
We have a pair of shoes
that we found in the trash

00:39:00,665 --> 00:39:02,933
behind your house,
with blood on them,

00:39:02,933 --> 00:39:04,702
and I am sure that,
when we test them,

00:39:04,702 --> 00:39:06,737
they are going to match
the shoe impression

00:39:06,737 --> 00:39:08,439
that you left
at the murder scene.

00:39:08,439 --> 00:39:10,441
RUSSELL: Also found
a turquoise stone,

00:39:10,441 --> 00:39:12,443
in the gravel,
outside the brothel.

00:39:12,443 --> 00:39:14,578
Matches perfectly to a bracelet

00:39:14,578 --> 00:39:16,881
that you had in your
dresser drawer, so...

00:39:16,881 --> 00:39:20,384
yeah, yeah,
we can prove this, Mrs. Logan.

00:39:28,225 --> 00:39:30,428
They're not my girls;
you know that.

00:39:33,564 --> 00:39:36,400
They were adopted.

00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,468
Jim's idea.

00:39:37,468 --> 00:39:38,669
Two more rescues.

00:39:38,669 --> 00:39:39,837
I never wanted 'em.

00:39:50,481 --> 00:39:52,349
Mr. Logan...

00:39:52,349 --> 00:39:54,652
your wife will
remain in custody.

00:39:54,652 --> 00:39:56,620
She's gonna be
charged with murder.

00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:57,888
I'm sorry.

00:39:57,888 --> 00:39:59,924
So it's true?

00:39:59,924 --> 00:40:01,759
She killed Debbie?

00:40:01,759 --> 00:40:02,760
Yes, sir.

00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:05,262
And then...

00:40:05,262 --> 00:40:06,931
what Ridley said, too? She was
selling the girls?

00:40:09,233 --> 00:40:13,237
Kirsten, for years,
until she ran away, yeah.

00:40:13,237 --> 00:40:14,839
And she was just
starting with Debbie.

00:40:14,839 --> 00:40:18,275
All this time, Kirsten...
never told me.

00:40:18,275 --> 00:40:19,744
Or maybe she tried
and I didn't see it.

00:40:19,744 --> 00:40:22,279
I don't know how
I could've been so blind.

00:40:23,447 --> 00:40:25,816
It's, you know, it's...

00:40:25,816 --> 00:40:27,551
been overwhelming.

00:40:27,551 --> 00:40:31,455
All these people in my parish
are in need and-and...

00:40:34,358 --> 00:40:36,660
...and I neglected the ones
who needed me the most.

00:40:38,195 --> 00:40:39,597
And now I've lost them.

00:40:44,802 --> 00:40:46,971
Well... maybe not all of them.

00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:50,374
You could still
save your daughter.

00:41:04,789 --> 00:41:07,224
I think she'll
be saving me.
