00:00:05,397 --> 00:00:07,173
WOMAN:
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>as we start</i>

00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:08,593
<i>our final descent</i>
<i>into Las Vegas,</i>

00:00:08,593 --> 00:00:10,194
<i>please make sure</i>
<i>your tray tables</i>

00:00:10,194 --> 00:00:12,697
and seat backs and are in
their full, upright position.

00:00:12,697 --> 00:00:14,065
Make sure your seat belts

00:00:14,065 --> 00:00:16,000
are securely fastened,
and all carry-on luggage

00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,702
is stowed underneath the seat
in front of you

00:00:17,702 --> 00:00:18,836
or in the overhead bins.

00:00:18,836 --> 00:00:22,073
(intercom chimes)

00:00:22,073 --> 00:00:23,641
You have a good flight?

00:00:23,641 --> 00:00:25,944
You have any idea
how gorgeous you are?

00:00:25,944 --> 00:00:27,111
Not interested,
but thanks.

00:00:27,111 --> 00:00:28,713
You smell good, too.

00:00:28,713 --> 00:00:30,848
You know, I dreamt about
you the whole flight.

00:00:30,848 --> 00:00:32,684
X-rated.
Is that your best line?

00:00:32,684 --> 00:00:35,620
I thought chicks flying
to Vegas were ready to party.

00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,655
Sir, I'm gonna need you
to take your seat.

00:00:37,655 --> 00:00:38,923
Yeah, I'm gonna
need another one

00:00:38,923 --> 00:00:40,158
of those
free drinks, though.

00:00:40,158 --> 00:00:42,594
Sorry, sweetie.
Bar's closed.

00:00:42,594 --> 00:00:44,929
Oh, wow, it's really
not my night.

00:00:44,929 --> 00:00:45,930
(scoffs)

00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:47,565
Psst!

00:00:47,565 --> 00:00:49,200
Maybe you're not coming on
strong enough.

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,836
(laughter)
(intercom dings)

00:00:51,836 --> 00:00:53,671
MAN:
This is your captain speaking.

00:00:53,671 --> 00:00:55,106
We've just been cleared
to land in Las Vegas,

00:00:55,106 --> 00:00:56,874
where the local time is 10:42

00:00:56,874 --> 00:00:58,576
and the temperature is
a pleasant 84 degrees.

00:00:58,576 --> 00:01:01,045
Cabin crew, please take
your seats for landing.

00:01:05,783 --> 00:01:06,985
WOMAN:
On behalf of Pan Transit

00:01:06,985 --> 00:01:08,486
and the entire flight crew,

00:01:08,486 --> 00:01:09,988
I'd like to thank you
for joining us

00:01:09,988 --> 00:01:12,190
and we look forward to seeing
you again in the future.

00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:13,558
Have a great night.
A little help?

00:01:13,558 --> 00:01:14,759
And good luck!
Which bag is yours?

00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:18,563
The yellow one. Thank you.

00:01:19,664 --> 00:01:20,698
Hey, look, I-I didn't mean

00:01:20,698 --> 00:01:22,000
to come off like a creep before.

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,601
I was just trying
to have a good time.

00:01:23,601 --> 00:01:24,969
Buy you a drink to apologize?

00:01:24,969 --> 00:01:27,672
I don't think so.
Bottle of champagne?

00:01:27,672 --> 00:01:29,140
Cut me some slack, baby! Damn!

00:01:30,942 --> 00:01:32,477
Hey, what the hell?

00:01:33,945 --> 00:01:35,146
Hey, my watch--
where the hell's my watch?

00:01:35,146 --> 00:01:36,648
It was in my bag.

00:01:36,648 --> 00:01:38,483
Hey, hey! Hold on!
Hold on, all right?

00:01:38,483 --> 00:01:39,817
Ain't nobody leaving this plane.

00:01:39,817 --> 00:01:41,419
I've been robbed.
Stewardess!

00:01:41,419 --> 00:01:42,954
Don't let anybody
off this plane!

00:01:42,954 --> 00:01:44,656
Hey, wait, hold on a second.

00:01:44,656 --> 00:01:46,958
You-you probably left it in
the bar at the, uh, airport...

00:01:46,958 --> 00:01:48,660
Ain't nobody got no time
for your jokes, man, okay?

00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,994
I'm gonna need some help
finding my watch.

00:01:49,994 --> 00:01:51,429
Somebody stole my watch!
MAN: Hey, hey, hey!

00:01:51,429 --> 00:01:52,897
What?
My wallet's gone, okay?

00:01:52,897 --> 00:01:53,898
Somebody stole my wallet.

00:01:53,898 --> 00:01:55,199
(passengers clamoring)

00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:57,468
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Somebody definitely

00:01:57,468 --> 00:01:59,103
went through my bag!
Who went through my bag?

00:01:59,103 --> 00:02:00,571
They stealing on this plane!
Hey!

00:02:00,571 --> 00:02:02,540
Come on!
(passengers clamoring)

00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,775
I got to get off!

00:02:03,775 --> 00:02:05,009
Come on, damn it!
Hey, hey! Get back, man!

00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:06,144
What the hell's
wrong with you, man?

00:02:06,144 --> 00:02:08,479
(passengers clamoring)

00:02:13,785 --> 00:02:15,453
You know...

00:02:15,453 --> 00:02:17,155
there's something about
being at the airport,

00:02:17,155 --> 00:02:19,657
that makes me just want to jump
on the next plane out of here.

00:02:19,657 --> 00:02:20,958
Doesn't matter where.

00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:22,060
Excitement of the unknown.

00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,828
No, Sara, I got big plans.

00:02:23,828 --> 00:02:26,164
Really?
Yeah, Morocco.

00:02:26,164 --> 00:02:28,733
You gonna open a bar
in Casablanca, Nick?

00:02:28,733 --> 00:02:30,101
Call me Rick.
(laughs)

00:02:30,101 --> 00:02:32,136
I think that was
his name, wasn't it?

00:02:32,136 --> 00:02:34,072
(Sidle laughs)

00:02:40,645 --> 00:02:42,880
PHILLIPS: Caucasian female,
early 30s.

00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,419
Blunt force trauma
to the head.

00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:51,823
(camera shutter clicking)

00:02:53,591 --> 00:02:55,693
STOKES: Well, looks like
she started out on the road.

00:02:55,693 --> 00:02:56,794
Skidded through the dirt and...

00:02:56,794 --> 00:02:59,063
she came to rest right here.

00:02:59,063 --> 00:03:00,932
Long way to roll.

00:03:00,932 --> 00:03:02,767
She hit the road
with significant velocity.

00:03:02,767 --> 00:03:04,702
It would explain
the road rash...

00:03:08,072 --> 00:03:10,208
...and the broken neck.

00:03:14,212 --> 00:03:15,780
She's dressed for a good time.

00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:16,981
I don't think she found it.

00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:20,151
Sara?

00:03:23,488 --> 00:03:25,990
"Janet Riggins,
Pan Transit flight 111."

00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:27,658
Originated in Newark.

00:03:27,658 --> 00:03:28,960
Layover in Atlanta.

00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,928
Landed here at 10:45 tonight.

00:03:30,928 --> 00:03:33,164
Well, that's got
to be some kind of record.

00:03:33,164 --> 00:03:35,133
Dead in under an hour.

00:03:36,734 --> 00:03:38,669

Please, everyone.

00:04:19,877 --> 00:04:21,078
Excuse me.

00:04:21,078 --> 00:04:22,780
Look, my credit cards
are in my wallet.

00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,182
My driver's license.

00:04:24,182 --> 00:04:26,050
How am I supposed to check
into my hotel, huh?

00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,052
I understand, sir.
WOMAN:
That pendant was irreplaceable.

00:04:28,052 --> 00:04:29,453
Irreplaceable!

00:04:29,453 --> 00:04:31,522
My mother gave it to me.

00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:32,723
My dead mother.

00:04:32,723 --> 00:04:33,991
Now, we want to help you.

00:04:33,991 --> 00:04:35,760
But we need your cooperation.

00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,462
Okay? Police officers are gonna
be taking your statements.

00:04:38,462 --> 00:04:40,731
And after that,
you're free to go.

00:04:40,731 --> 00:04:42,633
It's a family heirloom.
Do you understand that?

00:04:42,633 --> 00:04:44,101
Where am I supposed
to sleep tonight, huh?
Yeah!

00:04:44,101 --> 00:04:45,636
All right, look, the airlines,

00:04:45,636 --> 00:04:47,138
the airlines are gonna
help those of you

00:04:47,138 --> 00:04:48,706
who have to make connections.

00:04:48,706 --> 00:04:49,707
And when they can't,
they're gonna

00:04:49,707 --> 00:04:51,742
offer you hotel vouchers.

00:04:51,742 --> 00:04:53,444
At the cheapest hotel
you can find.

00:04:53,444 --> 00:04:54,478
But first,

00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:56,180
CSI Finlay and I

00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,816
need your help to do our job.

00:04:58,816 --> 00:04:59,951
Do you remember

00:04:59,951 --> 00:05:01,819
a woman who was seated

00:05:01,819 --> 00:05:03,955
in row three, seat D.

00:05:03,955 --> 00:05:05,623
3D.
Ooh, let me conjure up

00:05:05,623 --> 00:05:07,892
the seating plan in my head,
and do your job for you.

00:05:07,892 --> 00:05:09,594
Anybody here sit in row two,

00:05:09,594 --> 00:05:13,030
three or four?

00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:15,166
Okay, some of you men
might've remembered her.

00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:17,201
She had long blonde hair,

00:05:17,201 --> 00:05:19,036
a white dress, heels.

00:05:19,036 --> 00:05:21,873
Yeah, yeah, the blonde with the
ass in the tight, white dress.

00:05:21,873 --> 00:05:23,908
Why? Did she steal
my wallet, huh?

00:05:23,908 --> 00:05:25,209
I was sitting right behind her.

00:05:25,209 --> 00:05:27,912
She was acting very suspicious.

00:05:27,912 --> 00:05:29,180
(all clamoring)

00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,616
The woman
that we are talking about

00:05:31,616 --> 00:05:33,818
was just found dead.

00:05:33,818 --> 00:05:35,887
(all clamoring)

00:05:35,887 --> 00:05:37,722
So that makes this

00:05:37,722 --> 00:05:39,156
a homicide investigation.

00:05:39,156 --> 00:05:40,658
And you...

00:05:40,658 --> 00:05:43,060
are the last people
to see her alive.

00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,528
Him!

00:05:44,528 --> 00:05:45,663
He was harassing her.

00:05:45,663 --> 00:05:46,831
She wanted nothing
to do with him.

00:05:46,831 --> 00:05:47,965
I was just talking to the lady.

00:05:47,965 --> 00:05:49,533
Hater.

00:05:49,533 --> 00:05:50,935
Excuse me, sir?

00:05:50,935 --> 00:05:52,470
Could you tell me
how you got the black eye?

00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:53,771
Yeah, yeah.

00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:55,606
He-he didn't have that
on the plane, man.

00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:57,808
Hey, you need to mind
your damn business.
Yeah, right.

00:05:57,808 --> 00:05:58,976
My watch was in my carry-on

00:05:58,976 --> 00:06:00,211
in the overhead bin.

00:06:00,211 --> 00:06:01,846
When I realized
it had been stolen...

00:06:01,846 --> 00:06:04,115
No one is leaving this plane!
I want to get by here...

00:06:04,115 --> 00:06:06,550
Relax, okay?
Somebody stole my watch!

00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,519
Let me get by!

00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:10,655
<i>I hit my head when I fell.</i>
<i>Old guy, he fights dirty.</i>

00:06:10,655 --> 00:06:13,824
<i>When I looked up, I saw</i>
<i>the blonde pushing her way out.</i>

00:06:13,824 --> 00:06:16,193
And that was
the last time I saw her.

00:06:16,193 --> 00:06:18,462
Can anyone else confirm
that story?

00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:19,897
Yeah, the old guy had
some fight left in him.

00:06:19,897 --> 00:06:21,432
I don't know
about all that,

00:06:21,432 --> 00:06:23,634
all I know is the blonde
wanted off the plane.

00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:24,969
Am I right? Right?

00:06:24,969 --> 00:06:26,938
We all saw that.

00:06:26,938 --> 00:06:28,639
(passengers clamoring)

00:06:31,575 --> 00:06:33,110
The airline confirms

00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:35,680
Janet Riggins' flight
landed on time.

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,847
Gate F24.

00:06:36,847 --> 00:06:38,215
F Gate means she had to take

00:06:38,215 --> 00:06:39,884
the tram to baggage claim,

00:06:39,884 --> 00:06:42,186
pick up her checked bags.

00:06:42,186 --> 00:06:43,754
Well, she ended up here.

00:06:43,754 --> 00:06:45,489
She had to have
left the airport.

00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:46,958
Road leads
directly there.

00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:48,726
Yeah, but there's
a big convention in town.

00:06:48,726 --> 00:06:50,528
Long lines for taxis,
rental cars,

00:06:50,528 --> 00:06:51,662
shuttle buses.

00:06:51,662 --> 00:06:52,697
She'd still be waiting in line.

00:06:52,697 --> 00:06:53,798
She could've walked.

00:06:53,798 --> 00:06:55,566
Right, maybe in your shoes.

00:06:55,566 --> 00:06:56,701
But not in those heels.

00:06:56,701 --> 00:06:58,436
(chuckles)

00:06:58,436 --> 00:07:00,671
So... somebody
picked her up

00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:02,173
and gave her one hell of a ride.

00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:05,142
(screams)

00:07:05,142 --> 00:07:06,177
(car tires screeching)

00:07:10,748 --> 00:07:12,049
I think she left

00:07:12,049 --> 00:07:13,784
the vehicle at this swerve mark.

00:07:13,784 --> 00:07:14,885
Right here.

00:07:14,885 --> 00:07:15,953
SIDLE:
Distance from there

00:07:15,953 --> 00:07:17,054
to where she came to rest

00:07:17,054 --> 00:07:19,123
is 75 feet, so...

00:07:19,123 --> 00:07:21,158
30 is the constant,
multiplied

00:07:21,158 --> 00:07:23,060
by 75 feet,

00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,161
times the coefficient
of friction

00:07:24,161 --> 00:07:25,863
for sliding...

00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:27,031
On this terrain,
I'd give it a...

00:07:27,031 --> 00:07:28,032
a one.

00:07:28,032 --> 00:07:29,133
One? Lucky guess.

00:07:29,133 --> 00:07:31,836
2,250 feet.

00:07:31,836 --> 00:07:35,006
Square root of that.

00:07:35,006 --> 00:07:38,009
Vehicle was traveling
about 45 miles an hour.

00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:39,810
You physics majors, you're...

00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:41,212
you're show-offs.

00:07:43,614 --> 00:07:45,516
So the driver
never hit the brakes.

00:07:45,516 --> 00:07:47,651
This was no accident.

00:07:47,651 --> 00:07:49,620
And either she jumped out
or was thrown out.

00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,756
Her luggage could
still be in the car.

00:07:51,756 --> 00:07:54,191
If we're lucky, maybe the driver
threw it out with her.

00:07:55,626 --> 00:07:56,560
Nick, down!

00:07:57,828 --> 00:08:00,631
Laser...
pointed right at your chest.

00:08:00,631 --> 00:08:02,700
You see anything?

00:08:05,202 --> 00:08:06,537
There. Right there.

00:08:10,641 --> 00:08:12,610
Hey! Las Vegas Police.

00:08:14,712 --> 00:08:16,614
No, no, no!

00:08:16,614 --> 00:08:19,050
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I got him, I got him,
get this other guy!

00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:21,152
Stay down! Keep your hands where
I can see them! Don't move!

00:08:23,988 --> 00:08:25,790
What are you doing?

00:08:27,658 --> 00:08:30,528
(laughing)

00:08:30,528 --> 00:08:31,595
(grunts)

00:08:33,664 --> 00:08:34,665
What the hell are you doing?!

00:08:34,665 --> 00:08:36,200
Watching some planes, man.

00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,668
Huh?

00:08:37,668 --> 00:08:39,537
Don't point that thing at me!

00:08:39,537 --> 00:08:41,038
Chill! All right?

00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:42,773
We're just having a little fun.

00:08:42,773 --> 00:08:44,041
Hey, I got the other one!

00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:45,810
You know
that flashing pilots

00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:47,778
with your little laser's
a felony?

00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:49,880
You're interfering
with federal air operations.

00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:54,752
There was a murder
out here tonight.

00:08:56,053 --> 00:08:57,655
Did you and your buddy
see anything?

00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:00,191
(scoffs)

00:09:00,191 --> 00:09:01,425
We'll find out.

00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:06,664
(camera shutter clicks)

00:09:30,554 --> 00:09:32,556
I hear you and Nick collared
a couple of would-be

00:09:32,556 --> 00:09:34,458
terrorists tonight.
Yeah.

00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,060
Yeah, Nick threatened to bring
the FBI down on them

00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,496
unless they turn over
their laser pointers.

00:09:38,496 --> 00:09:39,997
And then he called
their parents.

00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:42,800
Who, I'm sure,
were very proud.

00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,568
So, where are we
with our victim?

00:09:44,568 --> 00:09:47,037
Well, Mr. Scare 'Em
Straight and I found

00:09:47,037 --> 00:09:49,607
the victim's carry-on bag down
the road from the crime scene.

00:09:49,607 --> 00:09:52,476
There's not much to go on,
but she is a local.

00:09:52,476 --> 00:09:54,178
Found a Nevada license.

00:09:56,881 --> 00:09:59,884
"Janet Riggins.

00:09:59,884 --> 00:10:01,051
1432 Desert Vista."

00:10:01,051 --> 00:10:02,953
I'll have Brass look at this.

00:10:09,994 --> 00:10:11,996
Can I see your license
for a second?

00:10:13,531 --> 00:10:15,432
Sure.

00:10:20,137 --> 00:10:21,872
Look at your photo.

00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:23,507
Uh-huh, when it's backlit,

00:10:23,507 --> 00:10:25,843
you can see the perforated
outline of Nevada.

00:10:25,843 --> 00:10:27,845
Right.

00:10:27,845 --> 00:10:29,013
Janet's...

00:10:31,182 --> 00:10:32,650
...not so much.

00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:33,817
So...

00:10:33,817 --> 00:10:36,654
why does Ms. Riggins
need a fake I.D.?

00:10:38,022 --> 00:10:39,190
BRASS: Here's some
video surveillance

00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:41,025
from outside
the baggage claim.

00:10:41,025 --> 00:10:43,127
That's the victim, right?
Janet Riggins?

00:10:43,127 --> 00:10:45,629
If that's even
her real name, yeah.

00:10:45,629 --> 00:10:47,431
Sure is looking over
her shoulder a lot.

00:10:47,431 --> 00:10:48,832
And what's she doing

00:10:48,832 --> 00:10:51,435
leaving baggage claim
with no checked bags?

00:10:51,435 --> 00:10:52,937
She didn't stick around
to claim 'em.

00:10:52,937 --> 00:10:55,673
And the reason she didn't
stick around is...

00:10:57,141 --> 00:10:58,509
...Kenny Greene.

00:10:58,509 --> 00:10:59,643
He was a passenger
on her flight.

00:10:59,643 --> 00:11:00,711
He had his
watch stolen.

00:11:00,711 --> 00:11:01,912
He told me
the last time

00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:03,447
he saw our victim
was on the plane.

00:11:03,447 --> 00:11:04,515
That's a lie.

00:11:04,515 --> 00:11:05,816
Yeah, and not
only that,

00:11:05,816 --> 00:11:08,152
when I met him,
he had a fresh black eye.

00:11:08,152 --> 00:11:09,753
He told me
that he got it

00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:11,021
when a fellow passenger

00:11:11,021 --> 00:11:13,190
banged his head on an armrest.

00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:14,592
Well, if he got it on the plane,

00:11:14,592 --> 00:11:15,826
then we should
see it right here.

00:11:15,826 --> 00:11:17,795
You think she gave it to him?

00:11:17,795 --> 00:11:19,663
I like to keep things simple
in the beginning.

00:11:19,663 --> 00:11:21,065
He ended up
with a shiner;

00:11:21,065 --> 00:11:22,833
she ended up dead.

00:11:27,171 --> 00:11:28,839
(exhales)

00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:30,941
My man!

00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:32,543
Any luck with that watch?

00:11:32,543 --> 00:11:34,578
Wow, the party never stops
for you, does it?

00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,215
Have you slept since the
last time I talked to you?

00:11:38,215 --> 00:11:39,617
You ever been to
Combustion Junction?

00:11:39,617 --> 00:11:41,552
(chuckles)
My lap is still achin'.

00:11:41,552 --> 00:11:42,720
It's open 24/7.

00:11:45,456 --> 00:11:47,791
You want to tell me again
about that black eye?

00:11:49,026 --> 00:11:50,561
Okay. Busted.

00:11:50,561 --> 00:11:52,630
I didn't get it
on the plane.

00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:53,864
No, you got it when
you beat up Janet Riggins.

00:11:53,864 --> 00:11:55,899
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

00:11:55,899 --> 00:11:57,101
Then how'd she
end up dead?

00:11:57,101 --> 00:11:58,602
I ran into the blonde
at baggage claim.

00:11:58,602 --> 00:12:00,004
Look, I just figured
it was the Vegas gods

00:12:00,004 --> 00:12:01,538
giving me another
crack at it.
I bet you're

00:12:01,538 --> 00:12:02,906
really tight with all
the Vegas deities.

00:12:02,906 --> 00:12:04,908
You know, me?
I'm tight with Father Time.

00:12:04,908 --> 00:12:06,910
You know,
like time code.

00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:09,179
See, the time this
picture was taken

00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:10,948
and the time you
showed up at the gate...

00:12:10,948 --> 00:12:12,650
that was two hours
of free time.
She was hot, man!

00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:13,917
I was looking to score.

00:12:13,917 --> 00:12:15,119
You can't arrest
a guy for trying.

00:12:15,119 --> 00:12:17,421
But when she saw me,
she ran.

00:12:17,421 --> 00:12:19,089
And that's when I knew
she stole my watch.

00:12:19,089 --> 00:12:20,557
Only the guilty run.

00:12:22,426 --> 00:12:24,428
Hey, babe?
Yeah.

00:12:24,428 --> 00:12:26,664
You got something
that belongs to me.

00:12:26,664 --> 00:12:28,198
You want your phone,
give me back my watch.

00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,101
Hey, that's assault!

00:12:31,101 --> 00:12:33,437
Look, I didn't
see that coming.

00:12:33,437 --> 00:12:34,738
All right?

00:12:34,738 --> 00:12:36,607
But that was the last
time I saw her.

00:12:36,607 --> 00:12:38,475
I spent the rest
of my "free time"

00:12:38,475 --> 00:12:40,644
at the airport bar,
waiting on you guys
to show up.

00:12:40,644 --> 00:12:42,880
Hey, if you don't believe me,
just ask the bartender.

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,481
She gave me her number.

00:12:44,481 --> 00:12:45,849
Let's say
I believe you, okay?

00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:47,518
Do you still have Janet
Riggins' cell phone?

00:12:50,654 --> 00:12:51,655
Oh...

00:12:51,655 --> 00:12:53,057
You stole her phone?

00:12:53,057 --> 00:12:54,458
Oh, no, no, no.
No, no.

00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:55,659
I was bargaining.

00:12:55,659 --> 00:12:56,727
I'm bargaining, too.

00:12:56,727 --> 00:12:58,462
So what do I get
if I charge you

00:12:58,462 --> 00:13:00,931
with robbery and
strong-arm assault?

00:13:02,566 --> 00:13:04,068
I can't catch a break.

00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:14,445
STOKES:
Hey.

00:13:14,445 --> 00:13:17,014
Any luck
I.D.'ing my victim?

00:13:17,014 --> 00:13:18,515
Well, she's got
a burner phone.

00:13:18,515 --> 00:13:19,917
You can get
one of those

00:13:19,917 --> 00:13:21,652
at any corner store
or gas station.
Yeah.

00:13:21,652 --> 00:13:23,420
Burner phone,
fake I.D....

00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,723
She sure is going to a lot
of trouble to stay anonymous.

00:13:25,723 --> 00:13:27,658
Well, if I were to pull
a mid-air caper,

00:13:27,658 --> 00:13:29,693
I'd fly under
an alias, too.

00:13:29,693 --> 00:13:32,496
She's got
a Vegas number.

00:13:32,496 --> 00:13:33,564
Chances are
she bought it local.

00:13:34,765 --> 00:13:36,533
(chuckles)

00:13:36,533 --> 00:13:39,002
Disregarding all the calls
her drunken assailant made

00:13:39,002 --> 00:13:40,571
to various call girls

00:13:40,571 --> 00:13:42,005
and phone sex
operators last night...

00:13:42,005 --> 00:13:42,940
Nice.

00:13:44,007 --> 00:13:45,909
HODGES:
...got one text,

00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:47,511
outgoing
at 10:48 p.m.

00:13:47,511 --> 00:13:49,513
to a local number.

00:13:49,513 --> 00:13:51,482
"Landed."

00:13:55,119 --> 00:13:56,086
No registered owner.

00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:57,788
Another burner.

00:13:57,788 --> 00:13:59,990
I'll get an AG Waiver
for the detail records.

00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:01,725
Maybe she texted
her ride.

00:14:01,725 --> 00:14:03,727
Or getaway driver.
Mmm.

00:14:04,962 --> 00:14:06,797
Also, she made
one phone call,

00:14:06,797 --> 00:14:08,065
13 minutes later,
at 11:01,

00:14:08,065 --> 00:14:09,433
to a different
local number.

00:14:14,538 --> 00:14:16,540
Nalley Janitorial
Services.

00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,475
North
Las Vegas.

00:14:19,843 --> 00:14:22,479
Maybe she needed someone
to clean up her mess.

00:14:30,721 --> 00:14:32,189
Jefferson Nalley?

00:14:32,189 --> 00:14:34,725
Yeah, uh... you must be
the guys that called.

00:14:35,859 --> 00:14:36,960
Yeah, I'm
Nick Stokes.

00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,462
This is
Sara Sidle.

00:14:38,462 --> 00:14:39,630
We're with
the crime scene unit.

00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:40,664
Need you to take
a look at a photo,

00:14:40,664 --> 00:14:41,698
if you don't mind.

00:14:41,698 --> 00:14:42,800
That's all?

00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,834
Yeah. Sure.

00:14:43,834 --> 00:14:45,135
Know this woman?

00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:46,904
No, no, never seen

00:14:46,904 --> 00:14:48,572
her before.
SARA: Then why'd she
call you last night,

00:14:48,572 --> 00:14:50,140
right before
she was murdered?

00:14:52,176 --> 00:14:53,844
Want to take
another look?

00:14:59,516 --> 00:15:01,518
It kind of looks like
Helen Morrison.

00:15:01,518 --> 00:15:03,520
Helen Morrison?
Yeah.

00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,088
God, I haven't seen her
since high school.

00:15:05,088 --> 00:15:06,089
She went blonde.

00:15:06,089 --> 00:15:07,524
What high school?

00:15:07,524 --> 00:15:08,692
Uh, Hardison High.

00:15:08,692 --> 00:15:09,827
Back in Hoboken.

00:15:09,827 --> 00:15:12,529
Yeah, Helen and I
grew up together.

00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:15,098
Wait, did you just say
that she was murdered?

00:15:15,098 --> 00:15:16,834
You moved out here together?

00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:18,569
No, no, I...

00:15:18,569 --> 00:15:20,671
I-I came out here
for college.

00:15:20,671 --> 00:15:22,773
The last I heard from Helen,
she was living in...

00:15:22,773 --> 00:15:23,874
Saddle River.

00:15:23,874 --> 00:15:25,742
So you have
kept in touch?

00:15:25,742 --> 00:15:26,743
Well, no.

00:15:26,743 --> 00:15:27,744
I mean, not really.

00:15:27,744 --> 00:15:29,480
We-we reconnected online

00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,081
about six months ago.

00:15:31,081 --> 00:15:32,749
Did you know
she was in Vegas?

00:15:32,749 --> 00:15:35,486
I knew that she was
planning a trip out west,

00:15:35,486 --> 00:15:36,987
and maybe swinging
through Vegas...

00:15:36,987 --> 00:15:38,789
And you two were gonna hook up,
is that the deal?

00:15:41,124 --> 00:15:42,659
Look, I can button
up that van,

00:15:42,659 --> 00:15:43,961
tow it downtown,
and we can talk down there.

00:15:43,961 --> 00:15:45,062
I don't care.

00:15:45,062 --> 00:15:47,998
After Helen found
me online, okay,

00:15:47,998 --> 00:15:49,566
she-she never mentioned

00:15:49,566 --> 00:15:51,568
that she was married.

00:15:51,568 --> 00:15:53,470
And then a couple
months later,
she let it slip.

00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:54,471
Look, I don't
mess around

00:15:54,471 --> 00:15:55,706
with married chicks anymore.

00:15:55,706 --> 00:15:56,974
There's too many
complications.

00:15:56,974 --> 00:15:58,008
You know what I mean.

00:15:59,676 --> 00:16:00,978
I cut it off.

00:16:00,978 --> 00:16:02,145
Then why was she calling you?

00:16:02,145 --> 00:16:04,781
I don't know.

00:16:04,781 --> 00:16:06,783
Look, I-I'd love
to help you guys out,

00:16:06,783 --> 00:16:08,151
but I've got my
hands full right now.

00:16:08,151 --> 00:16:10,187
Half my crew just
quit on me, so...

00:16:12,723 --> 00:16:14,825
You know what?

00:16:14,825 --> 00:16:17,027
Las night, I sent her call
through to voicemail.

00:16:17,027 --> 00:16:18,996
So... I mean,
knock yourself out.

00:16:18,996 --> 00:16:20,797
HELEN (on voicemail):
Jeff, I know I'm not supposed

00:16:20,797 --> 00:16:22,733
to contact you,
but I need help.

00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:23,967
I don't know who else to ask.

00:16:23,967 --> 00:16:25,435
Just call me back.

00:16:25,435 --> 00:16:26,436
(phone beeps)

00:16:26,436 --> 00:16:27,571
Some friend.

00:16:27,571 --> 00:16:30,908
Like I said, I cut it off.

00:16:30,908 --> 00:16:32,543
Well, it's not
my problem.

00:16:34,044 --> 00:16:36,113
You know what?

00:16:36,113 --> 00:16:39,116
I bet you guys need some cleanup
every once in a while.

00:16:39,116 --> 00:16:40,951
I sure would love
the opportunity.

00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,822
Yeah, I'd love to help,
but my hands are full.

FINLAY: According to
the flight manifest,

00:18:24,888 --> 00:18:27,424
Helen Morrison was
the last passenger

00:18:27,424 --> 00:18:28,792
to board Flight 111.

00:18:28,792 --> 00:18:30,961
She sat here,
in 3-D.

00:18:30,961 --> 00:18:32,729
Flight attendant said
that her carry-on

00:18:32,729 --> 00:18:34,598
did not fit underneath
the seat in front of her,

00:18:34,598 --> 00:18:36,733
the overhead bin
was full...

00:18:36,733 --> 00:18:39,536
I'm going to have
to take your bag, sweetie.

00:18:39,536 --> 00:18:41,138
I'd really prefer
to keep it down here.
I got it, I got it.

00:18:41,138 --> 00:18:43,206
I prefer to have
it here.
Thanks. I'll put it here.

00:18:43,206 --> 00:18:44,808
She stowed it here,

00:18:44,808 --> 00:18:46,209
two rows back.

00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:47,711
The open bins are
the ones that were robbed?

00:18:47,711 --> 00:18:49,846
Yes, there were
12 passengers

00:18:49,846 --> 00:18:51,782
who filed
police reports.

00:18:51,782 --> 00:18:54,518
These are the four
targeted bins.

00:18:54,518 --> 00:18:56,553
And in each one
of these bins

00:18:56,553 --> 00:18:58,055
there was at least one bag

00:18:58,055 --> 00:19:00,157
that was at some
distance from its owner.

00:19:00,157 --> 00:19:02,826
Well, that makes sense, because

00:19:02,826 --> 00:19:05,629
it's pretty risky to be rifling
through someone's bag

00:19:05,629 --> 00:19:07,164
when the owner is sitting
right beneath it.

00:19:07,164 --> 00:19:10,901
Rule number one of
the professional thief:

00:19:10,901 --> 00:19:13,437
board the plane early.

00:19:13,437 --> 00:19:15,172
Find a seat with a view.

00:19:15,172 --> 00:19:16,773
And I don't mean
a view outside.

00:19:16,773 --> 00:19:17,874
Our crook,

00:19:17,874 --> 00:19:19,509
in order to get a view

00:19:19,509 --> 00:19:21,044
of the targeted bins,

00:19:21,044 --> 00:19:24,181
had to have sat
aft of row eight.

00:19:24,181 --> 00:19:26,016
And he didn't want
to sit so far back
in the plane

00:19:26,016 --> 00:19:27,484
that he was on
the flight attendant's lap.

00:19:27,484 --> 00:19:29,486
And we have to presume
that our suspect

00:19:29,486 --> 00:19:30,754
boarded in
the first wave.

00:19:30,754 --> 00:19:32,689
So that definitely rules out

00:19:32,689 --> 00:19:34,725
Helen Morrison as our thief.

00:19:34,725 --> 00:19:35,959
She boarded last,

00:19:35,959 --> 00:19:37,794
sat forward of
the targeted bins,

00:19:37,794 --> 00:19:40,063
so she wouldn't have
been able to have eyes on.

00:19:40,063 --> 00:19:41,865
To get eyes on
and good visibility,

00:19:41,865 --> 00:19:43,934
an aisle seat
is the best seat.

00:19:43,934 --> 00:19:45,635
So that leaves
us with...

00:19:46,737 --> 00:19:48,004
...eight suspects.

00:19:48,004 --> 00:19:49,072
Who boarded early?

00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:53,210
9-C.

00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:55,746
Hank Kasserman boarded
with the first group.

00:19:55,746 --> 00:19:57,114
"Families with children

00:19:57,114 --> 00:19:58,815
and those needing assistance."

00:19:58,815 --> 00:20:01,051
You think a senior citizen
would qualify for that?

00:20:01,051 --> 00:20:03,754
Because I spoke with
another passenger...

00:20:03,754 --> 00:20:05,856
his name is Kenny Greene.

00:20:05,856 --> 00:20:07,524
He had his watch stolen.

00:20:07,524 --> 00:20:08,792
Now, he told me
he had an altercation

00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:11,661
with, quote,
"an elderly gentleman"

00:20:11,661 --> 00:20:13,597
who was in a real hurry
to get off the plane.

00:20:15,098 --> 00:20:17,100
Hank Kasserman,

00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,035
you've been upgraded

00:20:19,035 --> 00:20:20,904
to our number one suspect.

00:20:25,842 --> 00:20:27,778
Hey, Hank,
sit down, please.

00:20:32,082 --> 00:20:34,584
Wow, you know, Hank,
you know, you got

00:20:34,584 --> 00:20:36,086
almost enough
frequent flyer miles

00:20:36,086 --> 00:20:39,523
for a free room at
the Grey Bar Motel.

00:20:39,523 --> 00:20:41,925
That's the minimum security
prison in Indian Springs.

00:20:41,925 --> 00:20:44,728
I was thinking of,
um, saving my miles

00:20:44,728 --> 00:20:46,696
for a trip to Algeria.

00:20:46,696 --> 00:20:48,498
That's good.
There's no extradition.

00:20:48,498 --> 00:20:49,966
You know, more than a few
of your recent trips

00:20:49,966 --> 00:20:52,569
have coincided with
in-flight thefts.

00:20:52,569 --> 00:20:55,438
That's why I got
a brand-new bag.

00:20:55,438 --> 00:20:57,607
Tamper-proof zipper

00:20:57,607 --> 00:20:59,442
and an extra lock.
You know,

00:20:59,442 --> 00:21:00,877
these days you can't
trust anyone, right?

00:21:00,877 --> 00:21:02,112
They're awful.

00:21:02,112 --> 00:21:03,580
And, by the way,
I like watches.

00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:04,848
That's a nice watch
you're wearing.

00:21:04,848 --> 00:21:06,449
Oh. Well, you see, it's new.

00:21:06,449 --> 00:21:07,884
Now, if I flipped
it over,

00:21:07,884 --> 00:21:10,453
I wouldn't see an engraving,
"Cristal Kenny"

00:21:10,453 --> 00:21:11,655
on the back, would I?

00:21:11,655 --> 00:21:13,023
Oh, yeah.
Kenny is my father.

00:21:14,524 --> 00:21:16,059
Big drinker.

00:21:16,059 --> 00:21:18,662
Yeah, you're very quick
for an old guy, I gotta tell ya.

00:21:18,662 --> 00:21:21,097
You're pretty slow
for a young guy.

00:21:21,097 --> 00:21:22,699
All right, let me show you
something.

00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:24,134
Here's a list of
the things

00:21:24,134 --> 00:21:25,869
that were stolen
from Flight 111.

00:21:25,869 --> 00:21:27,571
And this is a list

00:21:27,571 --> 00:21:30,440
of the items that were recovered
from your hotel suite.

00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,541
Mm-hmm.

00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:32,843
It's an exact match.

00:21:32,843 --> 00:21:34,578
No!

00:21:34,578 --> 00:21:36,880
I hear you had a big night
at the casino last night.

00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,016
I was up, then I was down,
and I was up.

00:21:40,016 --> 00:21:42,052
Yeah, well,
now you're down again, Hank,

00:21:42,052 --> 00:21:44,120
'cause you're with me;
you're in the police station.

00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:48,825
I've got you on
12 counts of grand larceny.

00:21:48,825 --> 00:21:51,661
So how far are you gonna fall?

00:21:54,464 --> 00:21:56,099
What do you want to know?

00:21:56,099 --> 00:21:58,468
You walked in the Mediterranean
casino last night

00:21:58,468 --> 00:22:01,438
with a very big wedge of cash--
tell me about it.

00:22:01,438 --> 00:22:04,841
It's a score of a lifetime.

00:22:04,841 --> 00:22:06,476
There was a woman
on the plane.

00:22:06,476 --> 00:22:08,645
Blonde and in 3-D.

00:22:10,213 --> 00:22:12,182
<i>Clocked her the moment</i>
<i>she walked on the plane.</i>

00:22:12,182 --> 00:22:14,918
<i>Very well-dressed.</i>

00:22:14,918 --> 00:22:18,488
<i>And she was wearing expensive</i>
<i>shoes, expensive clothes.</i>

00:22:18,488 --> 00:22:20,590
<i>She had a designer carry-on.</i>

00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:22,058
<i>She was very reluctant</i>
<i>to let the flight attendant</i>

00:22:22,058 --> 00:22:24,661
<i>put it in the bin</i>
<i>a few rows back.</i>

00:22:24,661 --> 00:22:25,962
Please... please,
just this once, please...

00:22:25,962 --> 00:22:27,731
Can you just...?
Okay. Right there.

00:22:29,699 --> 00:22:33,937
So she put it two rows back
right over Cristal Kenny's seat.

00:22:33,937 --> 00:22:36,806
He was three sheets to the wind.
And I sent him the fourth.

00:22:36,806 --> 00:22:41,044
I'd like to buy my friend
in 5-D a drink.

00:22:41,044 --> 00:22:42,779
<i>I needed him passed out.</i>

00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:46,149
Passengers who are sleeping
or, uh, reading

00:22:46,149 --> 00:22:47,550
or, uh, watching a movie,

00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:49,085
they're easy marks.

00:22:49,085 --> 00:22:51,655
Oh, you're a real student
of human nature, Hank.

00:22:51,655 --> 00:22:55,492
When I'm working, I don't leave
anything to chance.

00:22:55,492 --> 00:22:57,661
When I'm playing...

00:22:57,661 --> 00:22:58,862
I'm all on black.

00:22:58,862 --> 00:23:01,531
What did you steal
from the blonde?

00:23:01,531 --> 00:23:04,668
Chick like that, I expected
you know, diamonds,

00:23:04,668 --> 00:23:06,102
uh, jewelry.

00:23:06,102 --> 00:23:09,873
But.. I hit the mother lode.

00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,983
<i>30 G's.</i>

00:23:19,983 --> 00:23:22,452
Is this the blonde?

00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,956
Well, I had nothing
to do with that.

00:23:25,956 --> 00:23:29,159
Hank, it's time
to go all in now.

00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:31,194
All on the black.

00:23:33,029 --> 00:23:34,764
Okay.

00:23:34,764 --> 00:23:36,633
Let me tell you what I saw.

00:23:36,633 --> 00:23:39,569
A woman of means

00:23:39,569 --> 00:23:41,438
traveling alone.

00:23:41,438 --> 00:23:43,106
She knew how to handle
that drunk.

00:23:43,106 --> 00:23:46,743
Never closed her eyes.
And kept,

00:23:46,743 --> 00:23:47,944
kept putting makeup on.

00:23:47,944 --> 00:23:50,080
Especially over here.

00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,017
She was trying
to hide a, a bruise.

00:23:55,752 --> 00:23:58,021
Now she's dead?

00:23:59,723 --> 00:24:03,760
You should be looking
for that guy

00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,129
that used her as a punching bag.

00:24:06,129 --> 00:24:09,032
Not some senior citizen
on a fixed income.

00:24:15,672 --> 00:24:17,574
SANDERS:
Hey, Doc.

00:24:17,574 --> 00:24:19,109
Heard you got a C.O.D.
I do.

00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:23,747
Atlanto-occipital dislocation

00:24:23,747 --> 00:24:26,583
due to being thrown
from a moving vehicle.

00:24:26,583 --> 00:24:28,785
But that's the least
troubling thing I found.

00:24:28,785 --> 00:24:31,154
Ms. Morrison was married.

00:24:31,154 --> 00:24:33,623
Yeah. Brass is tracking down
her husband.

00:24:33,623 --> 00:24:36,659
She has multiple perimortem
fractures consistent with

00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:38,128
falling from a moving vehicle,

00:24:38,128 --> 00:24:42,632
but these bony calluses
indicate healed fractures.

00:24:42,632 --> 00:24:45,502
This ulna fracture here
is typically the result

00:24:45,502 --> 00:24:48,505
of a direct blow while
the arm's in self-defense.

00:24:48,505 --> 00:24:50,440
No... No!

00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,475
Ms. Morrison has also has
several broken ribs.

00:24:52,475 --> 00:24:55,178
Two ribs, two separate events.

00:24:55,178 --> 00:24:58,481
Left number five, judging
by the size of the callus,

00:24:58,481 --> 00:24:59,783
is about six months old.

00:24:59,783 --> 00:25:01,651
Break to left number six,

00:25:01,651 --> 00:25:04,421
Callus is larger,
but not fully formed.

00:25:04,421 --> 00:25:06,990
That's a recent injury,
only a few weeks.

00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:09,659
It looks like he gave her
a black eye, too.

00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:11,194
Yeah, it was hidden
under her makeup.

00:25:11,194 --> 00:25:13,496
That's only a few days old.

00:25:13,496 --> 00:25:15,932
Well, the old man
on the plane was right.

00:25:15,932 --> 00:25:17,901
She's been physically abused.

00:25:17,901 --> 00:25:21,004
Yeah. Given the number
of healed fractures,

00:25:21,004 --> 00:25:23,006
it's been going on for years.

00:25:34,684 --> 00:25:37,520
Yeah, I heard the airline
finally located

00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,788
Helen Morrison's
checked luggage.

00:25:38,788 --> 00:25:40,523
And not what you
usually pack

00:25:40,523 --> 00:25:41,724
for a weekend
in Vegas:

00:25:41,724 --> 00:25:43,893
childhood photos,
teddy bear...

00:25:45,061 --> 00:25:46,930
her bronzed baby shoes.

00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:49,766
No, that's what you pack when
you're never going home again.

00:25:49,766 --> 00:25:51,734
She was definitely leaving
her husband.

00:25:51,734 --> 00:25:53,103
New identity,
new cell phone.

00:25:53,103 --> 00:25:55,071
$30,000 in cash.

00:25:55,071 --> 00:25:57,207
She had a plan.

00:25:57,207 --> 00:25:58,775
Saddle River PD
just called.

00:25:58,775 --> 00:25:59,943
Helen Morrison's
husband was not home.

00:25:59,943 --> 00:26:01,644
Evidently,

00:26:01,644 --> 00:26:03,113
he caught a flight to Vegas.

00:26:03,113 --> 00:26:06,149
So, the woman he's been using
as a punching bag

00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:07,717
finally left him,
and he followed her.

00:26:07,717 --> 00:26:10,553
Do we know what time
his flight got in?

00:26:10,553 --> 00:26:11,654
Yeah.
Morrison caught a nonstop.

00:26:11,654 --> 00:26:13,022
Helen's flight had a layover.

00:26:13,022 --> 00:26:15,425
So that put him in about
15 minutes before her.

00:26:15,425 --> 00:26:17,427
Well, that give him motive
and opportunity.

00:26:17,427 --> 00:26:19,195
(phone ringing)
Yep. Hold on a sec.

00:26:21,097 --> 00:26:23,500
Doc Robbins says that
out concerned husband

00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,568
is in Autopsy as we speak.

00:26:25,568 --> 00:26:27,537
What the hell's he doing
down there?
No idea.

00:26:27,537 --> 00:26:29,205
MAN:
<i>Look, Doctor, I know</i>

00:26:29,205 --> 00:26:31,207
you've got your rules,
but we're talking about my wife!

00:26:31,207 --> 00:26:33,109
The cops just told me
that she was dead.

00:26:33,109 --> 00:26:35,745
I have a right to say good-bye.

00:26:35,745 --> 00:26:37,514
Look, her body's already
been identified.

00:26:37,514 --> 00:26:39,482
There's no reason
for you to be here.

00:26:39,482 --> 00:26:40,950
No reason?
A mortuary can

00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:42,118
provide the final viewing.

00:26:42,118 --> 00:26:43,786
The final view...?
Hey!

00:26:43,786 --> 00:26:45,455
What are you talking about?
I'm not your wife!

00:26:45,455 --> 00:26:47,590
Hey, hey, hey! Mr. Morrison,
what are you doing?

00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:49,726
Sorry. I just got
a little worked up.

00:26:49,726 --> 00:26:51,461
All right,
I'm Nick Stokes.

00:26:51,461 --> 00:26:53,696
I'm the one handling
your wife's murder, okay?

00:26:53,696 --> 00:26:56,432
Did you catch the bastard
who did it yet?

00:26:56,432 --> 00:26:58,001
I will.

00:26:58,001 --> 00:27:00,136
Well, what's that
supposed to mean?

00:27:00,136 --> 00:27:02,138
That the, that the husband
is always the first suspect?

00:27:02,138 --> 00:27:04,207
There's a good reason for that.

00:27:04,207 --> 00:27:08,077
Listen, my wife and I had
a very physical relationship.

00:27:08,077 --> 00:27:09,846
Oh, we know. Bodies don't lie.

00:27:09,846 --> 00:27:11,014
What's this say?!

00:27:12,649 --> 00:27:14,717
She liked to test me.

00:27:14,717 --> 00:27:17,120
She liked to make me
feel jealous.

00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,089
She would leave little bread
crumbs all over the place.

00:27:20,089 --> 00:27:23,693
Like a few months ago when
she left her e-mail open

00:27:23,693 --> 00:27:25,628
so that I could read
a little exchange

00:27:25,628 --> 00:27:26,963
between her
and an old flame.

00:27:26,963 --> 00:27:28,097
That's why
you broke her arm.

00:27:28,097 --> 00:27:29,532
Would you shut up?

00:27:29,532 --> 00:27:32,835
There were pictures,
explicit pictures.

00:27:32,835 --> 00:27:35,838
So when I confronted her,
she denied it.

00:27:35,838 --> 00:27:37,574
Which is another game
she likes to play.

00:27:37,574 --> 00:27:40,977
But yesterday,
Helen crossed the line.

00:27:40,977 --> 00:27:43,846
I get a call from my bank

00:27:43,846 --> 00:27:47,016
which says that she withdrew
all of our money.

00:27:47,016 --> 00:27:49,185
All of <i>my</i> money.

00:27:49,185 --> 00:27:52,555
So I go home,
and she's gone.

00:27:52,555 --> 00:27:54,123
And you took
the next flight out.

00:27:54,123 --> 00:27:55,658
So you'd be here
when she landed.

00:27:55,658 --> 00:27:57,794
Yes, that's right, Sherlock.

00:27:57,794 --> 00:28:00,196
I figured she would run
to her boyfriend.

00:28:00,196 --> 00:28:01,831
But my plane was delayed.

00:28:01,831 --> 00:28:03,800
A mechanical error.

00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,603
And I didn't get in
until after midnight.

00:28:08,204 --> 00:28:10,707
Which is probably better.

00:28:10,707 --> 00:28:12,041
Saved me a life sentence.

00:28:12,041 --> 00:28:13,710
Oh, we'll check
with the airlines.

00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:16,145
Okay, fine, do that, Doctor!
Check the airlines!

00:28:16,145 --> 00:28:18,948
But I'm not leaving here until
I see my wife's dead body.

00:28:18,948 --> 00:28:20,683
And I want my money back.

00:28:20,683 --> 00:28:21,951
Now, tell me about
this boyfriend.

00:28:21,951 --> 00:28:23,653
Does he have a name?

00:28:23,653 --> 00:28:25,788
He has this little
housecleaning business,

00:28:25,788 --> 00:28:27,790
the little schmuck.

00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:29,058
His name is Jefferson.

00:28:33,463 --> 00:28:37,100
When that psychotic husband
of hers found out

00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,569
that we'd been chatting online,

00:28:39,569 --> 00:28:41,671
he put her in the hospital.
If you're looking

00:28:41,671 --> 00:28:44,207
for who killed her,
you should look at him.

00:28:44,207 --> 00:28:45,508
That guy is dangerous.

00:28:45,508 --> 00:28:47,443
He's a control freak.

00:28:47,443 --> 00:28:50,146
He monitored all
of her phone calls,

00:28:50,146 --> 00:28:51,648
all of her e-mails.

00:28:51,648 --> 00:28:54,584
He kept track of every nickel
that she spent.

00:28:54,584 --> 00:28:57,954
Now, look, I-I know you think
that I am a real S.O.B., but...

00:28:57,954 --> 00:28:59,555
Maybe if you'd
helped her,

00:28:59,555 --> 00:29:02,725
answered her call,
she'd still be alive.

00:29:02,725 --> 00:29:03,926
I did help her.

00:29:03,926 --> 00:29:05,928
When I found out

00:29:05,928 --> 00:29:08,698
that Allen had been
hitting her,

00:29:08,698 --> 00:29:12,101
how many times he put her
in the hospital,

00:29:12,101 --> 00:29:15,204
I begged her
to leave him.

00:29:15,204 --> 00:29:18,174
I set her up with this guy.

00:29:18,174 --> 00:29:20,176
I-I met him in a bar
a while back.

00:29:20,176 --> 00:29:23,746
And for a price,

00:29:23,746 --> 00:29:26,015
he could make anybody disappear.

00:29:26,015 --> 00:29:27,950
This guy have a name?

00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:29,452
He went by "The Wolf."

00:29:29,452 --> 00:29:30,620
The Wolf?

00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,188
He was like
a private witness

00:29:32,188 --> 00:29:34,590
relocation program.

00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:37,627
And I, I arranged
the-the introduction.

00:29:37,627 --> 00:29:39,662
Did he pick her up
at the airport?

00:29:39,662 --> 00:29:41,731
See, that's just the thing.
I don't know. I-I'm not sure.

00:29:41,731 --> 00:29:43,499
See, he had these rules,

00:29:43,499 --> 00:29:45,001
nonnegotiable rules.

00:29:45,001 --> 00:29:48,604
And Helen and I, we were to cut
off all communication

00:29:48,604 --> 00:29:51,708
with each other for at least
six months, maybe more.

00:29:51,708 --> 00:29:54,811
And we weren't supposed
to trust calls

00:29:54,811 --> 00:29:56,145
or e-mails from each other

00:29:56,145 --> 00:29:57,747
because they could've
been a trap.

00:29:57,747 --> 00:30:00,983
And we could have ended up hurt
or... or dead.

00:30:00,983 --> 00:30:02,819
Helen <i>was</i> beaten

00:30:02,819 --> 00:30:05,488
last night, and then she was
pushed from a moving vehicle.

00:30:07,023 --> 00:30:09,492
Do you think that
The Wolf killed her?

00:30:09,492 --> 00:30:10,993
How do I get a hold of him?

00:30:10,993 --> 00:30:15,198
Well, I, uh... I have
a cell phone number for him.

00:30:15,198 --> 00:30:16,799
I-I don't know
if it's still good.

00:30:20,103 --> 00:30:23,506
SIDLE:
<i>It's the phone number that</i>
<i>Helen texted when she landed.</i>

00:30:23,506 --> 00:30:26,476
According to the boyfriend,
it was payment on arrival.

00:30:26,476 --> 00:30:28,044
The Wolf had paid
for her plane ticket,

00:30:28,044 --> 00:30:29,879
her fake I.D.,
her cell phone,

00:30:29,879 --> 00:30:31,914
and any other arrangements that
he'd made for her future.

00:30:31,914 --> 00:30:34,584
But after she was robbed,
she had no money to pay him.

00:30:34,584 --> 00:30:37,587
Probably why she ignored
The Wolf's instructions
and called the boyfriend.

00:30:37,587 --> 00:30:38,621
But he didn't answer.

00:30:38,621 --> 00:30:39,655
She really had no choice.

00:30:39,655 --> 00:30:40,790
She had to stick to the plan.

00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:43,793
Well, he left a trail, so...

00:30:43,793 --> 00:30:45,461
let's track down this wolf.

00:31:13,656 --> 00:31:15,892
♪ ♪

00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:31,441
SANDERS:
<i>Brass and I checked out the bar</i>

00:31:31,441 --> 00:31:33,443
<i>where the vic's boyfriend</i>
<i>says he met The Wolf.</i>

00:31:33,443 --> 00:31:35,812
No one there knew him.
Although the sun was still up.

00:31:35,812 --> 00:31:38,114
So we'll go back later
and talk to the night crowd.

00:31:38,114 --> 00:31:39,782
But I did meet a guy
named "The Goat,"

00:31:39,782 --> 00:31:41,818
who says he'll eat
anything for a dollar.

00:31:41,818 --> 00:31:43,052
Beard, pierced ear?
Yeah.

00:31:43,052 --> 00:31:45,087
I had to get evidence
out of him once.

00:31:45,087 --> 00:31:46,589
Gross.

00:31:46,589 --> 00:31:47,957
Helen's cell was purchased

00:31:47,957 --> 00:31:49,992
at the Silver Wagon
Convenience Store on Flamingo.

00:31:49,992 --> 00:31:51,727
No functioning cameras.

00:31:51,727 --> 00:31:53,029
Buyer paid all cash.

00:31:53,029 --> 00:31:54,897
Her plane ticket was bought
on Boulder Highway

00:31:54,897 --> 00:31:56,098
at Truxton Travel.

00:31:56,098 --> 00:31:57,133
Let me guess--
cash, no cameras.

00:31:57,133 --> 00:31:59,202
You got it.
Thank you.

00:31:59,202 --> 00:32:00,636
Any luck?

00:32:00,636 --> 00:32:02,772
Uh, Wolf's phone
has gone silent.

00:32:02,772 --> 00:32:04,907
No activity since last
night around midnight.

00:32:04,907 --> 00:32:06,776
Time of the murder.

00:32:06,776 --> 00:32:10,079
Yeah, and his call detail
records have come in.

00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:12,081
The phone was activated
ten weeks ago.

00:32:12,081 --> 00:32:14,584
Since then, it's been used
around the Greater Vegas area.

00:32:14,584 --> 00:32:16,919
90% of all the activity occurred

00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:19,455
between 10:00 p.m.
and 6:00 a.m.

00:32:19,455 --> 00:32:21,457
Sounds like
our werewolf works nights.

00:32:21,457 --> 00:32:23,559
And he definitely has a routine.

00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:24,861
Every Monday night,

00:32:24,861 --> 00:32:27,563
his phone pings off
of the tower in Henderson.

00:32:27,563 --> 00:32:29,599
On Tuesdays he's
in Spring Valley.

00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:31,067
Helen's plane ticket
was purchased

00:32:31,067 --> 00:32:32,535
in Henderson on a Monday.

00:32:32,535 --> 00:32:34,971
And the phone
in Spring Valley on a Tuesday.

00:32:34,971 --> 00:32:37,006
Where was The Wolf last night?

00:32:37,006 --> 00:32:40,109
On Wednesday he was
just off the Strip

00:32:40,109 --> 00:32:41,210
near the airport.

00:32:42,678 --> 00:32:44,747
When I was 15,
I tried to make

00:32:44,747 --> 00:32:47,650
a fake I.D. using pencil,
chalk and hair spray.

00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:49,552
If I had had one that
was this good,

00:32:49,552 --> 00:32:51,487
I could've gotten
into any bar I wanted.

00:32:51,487 --> 00:32:54,123
When you were 15, you probably
looked more like you were 12.

00:32:54,123 --> 00:32:57,093
And not even a letter from your
dad would've gotten you in.

00:32:57,093 --> 00:33:00,663
Well, Helen Morrison's
fake license

00:33:00,663 --> 00:33:01,898
isn't even a license.

00:33:01,898 --> 00:33:03,165
Official DMV licenses
aren't chipped.

00:33:03,165 --> 00:33:06,569
And I found
an RFID chip in hers.

00:33:06,569 --> 00:33:09,038
Common in security badges
like ours.

00:33:09,038 --> 00:33:10,172
So where do you get
one of those?

00:33:10,172 --> 00:33:12,108
The county prints ours.

00:33:12,108 --> 00:33:13,876
For casinos and large companies,
they make their own.

00:33:13,876 --> 00:33:14,877
And there are
a couple dozen businesses

00:33:14,877 --> 00:33:16,779
around town that print them.

00:33:16,779 --> 00:33:19,916
So the Wolf had access to blank
security cards and a printer.

00:33:19,916 --> 00:33:21,183
Not just any printer.

00:33:21,183 --> 00:33:22,852
This is a quality print job

00:33:22,852 --> 00:33:24,620
from a top-of-the-line
digital printer.

00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:27,490
Which narrows it down
to only a dozen facilities.

00:33:30,793 --> 00:33:32,895
"Slots of Luck Industries,

00:33:32,895 --> 00:33:34,430
Varlos Boulevard."

00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:36,666
We have his phone pinging
off the tower

00:33:36,666 --> 00:33:37,733
in North Las Vegas.

00:33:37,733 --> 00:33:39,068
North Las Vegas means

00:33:39,068 --> 00:33:40,670
he was there on Friday.

00:33:49,745 --> 00:33:52,214
We were the first company
in Vegas to get the Lazgan.

00:33:52,214 --> 00:33:55,217
Better printer means
I can charge more for jobs.

00:33:55,217 --> 00:33:56,852
We don't print
driver's licenses.

00:33:56,852 --> 00:33:58,521
Yeah, but could you
if you wanted to?

00:33:58,521 --> 00:33:59,855
It's against the law.

00:33:59,855 --> 00:34:01,424
It's not a trick question.

00:34:01,424 --> 00:34:02,959
Is your machine capable
of printing this?

00:34:02,959 --> 00:34:04,827
Technically, yes.

00:34:04,827 --> 00:34:06,996
I print all our
employee I.D. badges.

00:34:06,996 --> 00:34:08,664
So, to make
a driver's license,

00:34:08,664 --> 00:34:10,533
it's just a matter
of downloading the template

00:34:10,533 --> 00:34:12,134
and uploading a photo.

00:34:12,134 --> 00:34:15,571
But it's against the law.
But it's against the law.

00:34:15,571 --> 00:34:16,973
We have reason to believe
that someone printed

00:34:16,973 --> 00:34:18,841
this license on that machine.

00:34:18,841 --> 00:34:21,177
If it was one of my employees,
that's cause for termination.

00:34:21,177 --> 00:34:23,846
How about outside
normal business hours?

00:34:23,846 --> 00:34:25,448
Only my security guard
has access.

00:34:25,448 --> 00:34:27,650
But George has been
with us forever.

00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:28,784
Does he work Friday nights?

00:34:28,784 --> 00:34:30,119
Yes.

00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:32,154
And the cleaning crew.

00:34:32,154 --> 00:34:34,890
They're here every Friday.

00:34:36,158 --> 00:34:38,160
Hey, Stokes.

00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,663
Hooked you up with
some rougher customers.

00:34:42,732 --> 00:34:44,066
Oh, yeah.

00:34:48,771 --> 00:34:50,840
Scoot over

00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,174
for me, will you, boys?

00:34:52,174 --> 00:34:53,809
Thanks.

00:34:57,546 --> 00:34:59,015
What's up?

00:34:59,015 --> 00:35:00,983
I'm in a lot of trouble
because of you.

00:35:00,983 --> 00:35:02,618
Because of me?

00:35:02,618 --> 00:35:04,186
I'm not the one that made
you smoke dope,

00:35:04,186 --> 00:35:06,822
get all dumb and endanger
planeloads of people.

00:35:06,822 --> 00:35:09,925
My dad took my car away.
Oh.

00:35:09,925 --> 00:35:12,094
And that guy said
that I'm looking

00:35:12,094 --> 00:35:14,597
at 4,000 hours of
community service.

00:35:14,597 --> 00:35:17,133
Could be staring at a felony.
Or you could be sharing

00:35:17,133 --> 00:35:19,535
a cell with this fella
right here.

00:35:19,535 --> 00:35:20,970
You'd like that,
wouldn't you?

00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:23,005
See there? you're
already making friends.

00:35:23,005 --> 00:35:25,107
No...
(clears throat)

00:35:25,107 --> 00:35:27,009
Now, I can't
really do anything

00:35:27,009 --> 00:35:28,544
about your old man,

00:35:28,544 --> 00:35:31,147
but I might be able to shave
a few thousand hours

00:35:31,147 --> 00:35:32,915
of community service off.

00:35:32,915 --> 00:35:35,051
What do I have to do?
Last night,

00:35:35,051 --> 00:35:37,053
air traffic control reported

00:35:37,053 --> 00:35:39,989
laser hits on inbound
flights at 11:25.

00:35:39,989 --> 00:35:42,458
That puts you at the
end of the runway

00:35:42,458 --> 00:35:45,194
when my victim was thrown
out of a moving car.

00:35:45,194 --> 00:35:46,896
What'd you see?

00:35:46,896 --> 00:35:48,764
(laughs)
I don't know.

00:35:48,764 --> 00:35:51,500
There was lots of planes.

00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,703
Uh, a f... a few cars.

00:35:53,703 --> 00:35:56,505
Then a-a lot of cops.

00:35:56,505 --> 00:35:57,773
You...

00:35:57,773 --> 00:36:00,710
were there.

00:36:02,011 --> 00:36:03,879
4,000 hours
of community service.

00:36:03,879 --> 00:36:05,648
That's like being
busy every weekend

00:36:05,648 --> 00:36:07,717
for the next ten years, so...

00:36:07,717 --> 00:36:09,452
Come-come on, man,
listen... (groans)

00:36:09,452 --> 00:36:13,022
I was really stoned, man.

00:36:13,022 --> 00:36:15,057
I mean, help me out, guys--
even when you're really stoned,

00:36:15,057 --> 00:36:18,494
you notice if a car's
going too fast.

00:36:18,494 --> 00:36:19,895
Or if it's swerving.

00:36:19,895 --> 00:36:21,530
A woman's dead.

00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:23,065
You realize that, right?

00:36:23,065 --> 00:36:25,134
Yeah.
Okay, so think.

00:36:25,134 --> 00:36:27,636
If it wasn't a car,
maybe it was something else.

00:36:27,636 --> 00:36:29,538
Maybe it was something bigger.

00:36:29,538 --> 00:36:31,207
Oh, there-there was this guy.

00:36:31,207 --> 00:36:32,675
Um...

00:36:32,675 --> 00:36:35,778
a farmer with a pitchfork.

00:36:35,778 --> 00:36:37,813
Farmer with a pitchfork
at the end of the tarmac?

00:36:37,813 --> 00:36:40,683
Well, no, like, not...
He wasn't a... Why?

00:36:40,683 --> 00:36:42,585
You can have a seat right here.
Well, I was...

00:36:42,585 --> 00:36:43,919
Why don't you two guys
get to know each other?
Well...

00:36:43,919 --> 00:36:46,055
He says there's a farmer
with a pitchfork

00:36:46,055 --> 00:36:47,189
at the end of the tarmac?

00:36:47,189 --> 00:36:49,992
No... (laughs)

00:36:49,992 --> 00:36:52,027
Not a... He's not a real guy.

00:36:52,027 --> 00:36:53,763
It was... He was a cartoon.

00:36:53,763 --> 00:36:55,831
Okay.
No!

00:36:55,831 --> 00:36:58,200
No, it was on...
it was on a side of a van!

00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,636
It looked like a farmer
with a pitchfork.

00:37:00,636 --> 00:37:01,737
Only it was, uh,

00:37:01,737 --> 00:37:04,907
it was some moron with a mop.

00:37:07,143 --> 00:37:09,578
Moron with a mop?

00:37:09,578 --> 00:37:10,546
Yeah.

00:37:12,715 --> 00:37:14,650
Was it that moron?

00:37:16,452 --> 00:37:17,419
Yeah.

00:37:17,419 --> 00:37:19,021
That's him.

00:37:20,823 --> 00:37:23,125
BRASS: So, a witness places
your van at the crime scene

00:37:23,125 --> 00:37:24,660
at the time
of Helen's murder.

00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,929
And Truxton Travel
I.D.'d you from a photo.

00:37:26,929 --> 00:37:28,430
That's the travel agency

00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:29,832
where you bought
a plane ticket for Helen.

00:37:29,832 --> 00:37:32,201
And we know that you printed
Helen's fake license

00:37:32,201 --> 00:37:34,103
at Slots of Luck
where you used to work

00:37:34,103 --> 00:37:35,704
every Friday night.

00:37:35,704 --> 00:37:37,540
Yeah, well, I-I was...

00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,975
I was trying to help her.

00:37:39,975 --> 00:37:41,877
I loved Helen.

00:37:41,877 --> 00:37:44,013
So you made up some
fake hero named The Wolf?

00:37:44,013 --> 00:37:45,614
She was terrified
that her husband

00:37:45,614 --> 00:37:47,216
was gonna kill us both.

00:37:47,216 --> 00:37:49,084
So, she didn't want me involved.

00:37:49,084 --> 00:37:50,920
But I wasn't gonna
turn my back...

00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,588
You weren't gonna turn
your back on her money.

00:37:52,588 --> 00:37:53,589
It wasn't her money.

00:37:53,589 --> 00:37:54,690
It was Allen's money.

00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:55,991
Yeah, $30,000, right?

00:37:55,991 --> 00:37:57,860
Now, was that the amount
that The Wolf told

00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,461
Helen it would cost
to start her new life?

00:37:59,461 --> 00:38:02,531
Or was 30K the number

00:38:02,531 --> 00:38:04,733
that Helen said
that she could get her hands on?

00:38:04,733 --> 00:38:08,003
It wasn't like that.

00:38:08,003 --> 00:38:09,471
She was getting a fresh start.

00:38:09,471 --> 00:38:10,940
And, yeah...

00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:14,443
I was getting the money,
but I was also getting my girl.

00:38:16,145 --> 00:38:18,614
Hey!

00:38:18,614 --> 00:38:20,783
What are you doing here?

00:38:20,783 --> 00:38:23,219
How did you know I'd be here?
I'm meeting The Wolf.

00:38:23,219 --> 00:38:25,020
You can't be here!
Change of plans. Get in.

00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:27,022
No, you heard what he said.
We can't be seen together.

00:38:27,022 --> 00:38:28,624
It's all right.
He called me. Come on.

00:38:28,624 --> 00:38:30,125
Everything is going wrong.

00:38:30,125 --> 00:38:32,494
No, Helen, everything's
gonna be fine, all right?

00:38:32,494 --> 00:38:33,963
Just get in.

00:38:33,963 --> 00:38:35,965
I'm gonna take you
to the motel.

00:38:35,965 --> 00:38:38,701
And then I'm gonna bring
The Wolf his money.

00:38:38,701 --> 00:38:40,703
I don't have it.

00:38:41,871 --> 00:38:43,706
Someone stole it.
Stole it?

00:38:43,706 --> 00:38:44,874
In my carry-on, on the plane.

00:38:44,874 --> 00:38:46,442
Someone stole it!

00:38:46,442 --> 00:38:47,776
No, you don't understand.

00:38:47,776 --> 00:38:49,478
The Wolf needs his money.

00:38:49,478 --> 00:38:51,513
He can't help you
without the money.

00:38:51,513 --> 00:38:52,781
Where is The Wolf?
Where is The Wolf?

00:38:52,781 --> 00:38:54,650
I need to talk to The Wolf.

00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:56,118
BRASS:
<i>So, there was no Wolf.</i>

00:38:56,118 --> 00:38:57,519
There was no happy ending.

00:38:57,519 --> 00:38:59,088
It was all about the money.

00:38:59,088 --> 00:39:00,055
You killed her.

00:39:01,457 --> 00:39:02,625
You're as bad as her husband.

00:39:03,626 --> 00:39:05,527
Look, you're right.

00:39:05,527 --> 00:39:07,129
I-I-I-I was upset

00:39:07,129 --> 00:39:09,632
about the money,
and I-I lost my cool.

00:39:09,632 --> 00:39:11,634
But I loved Helen.

00:39:11,634 --> 00:39:13,202
I-I was planning

00:39:13,202 --> 00:39:14,970
a life with her.

00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:18,507
And when I told her
that there was no Wolf,

00:39:18,507 --> 00:39:19,875
she freaked out.

00:39:19,875 --> 00:39:21,477
HELEN:
<i>I trusted you!</i>

00:39:21,477 --> 00:39:25,047
How could you do this to me?!

00:39:25,047 --> 00:39:26,949
You just wanted the money.
What?

00:39:26,949 --> 00:39:28,484
You were never gonna help me.

00:39:28,484 --> 00:39:30,185
No, Helen, that is not true.

00:39:30,185 --> 00:39:32,054
You told me
to leave my husband.

00:39:32,054 --> 00:39:33,989
You told me I would be safe!

00:39:33,989 --> 00:39:35,624
Allen's gonna kill me.

00:39:35,624 --> 00:39:37,493
Allen's gonna find me
and he's gonna kill me.

00:39:37,493 --> 00:39:38,527
No, Helen...

00:39:38,527 --> 00:39:39,528
Pull over, stop the car.

00:39:39,528 --> 00:39:40,696
No, no!
Stop the car!

00:39:40,696 --> 00:39:41,697
No, oh, my God!
Just stop the car!

00:39:41,697 --> 00:39:42,731
God! Helen!

00:39:42,731 --> 00:39:43,732
Helen!, no!
Stop the car!

00:39:43,732 --> 00:39:45,034
No! Oh, my God!

00:39:45,034 --> 00:39:46,568
Stop the car and pull over!
Aah!

00:39:46,568 --> 00:39:47,803
No, no, stop it!

00:39:47,803 --> 00:39:49,438
Get down!
Stop the car!

00:39:49,438 --> 00:39:50,639
My God, you're
gonna kill us both!

00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:52,107
Let me out! Just let me out!

00:39:52,107 --> 00:39:53,776
I need to get out!
Helen! Oh, my God, no!

00:39:53,776 --> 00:39:54,777
I need to get...
No!

00:39:54,777 --> 00:39:55,844
Let go of me!

00:39:55,844 --> 00:39:58,514
Stop it!

00:39:58,514 --> 00:39:59,982
(tires screech)

00:39:59,982 --> 00:40:02,918
I am done with that.

00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:05,788
(both grunting)

00:40:05,788 --> 00:40:06,822
No one hits me!

00:40:06,822 --> 00:40:08,023
No!
(screams)

00:40:08,023 --> 00:40:09,425
No!

00:40:09,425 --> 00:40:11,160
Sit down!
(screaming)

00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,795
Helen!
(Helen screams)

00:40:13,963 --> 00:40:15,431
(van tires screeching)

00:40:15,431 --> 00:40:16,832
I didn't mean to hurt her.

00:40:16,832 --> 00:40:18,968
So you pushed her
out of a van

00:40:18,968 --> 00:40:21,570
going 45 miles an hour.

00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:24,707
And kept on driving.

00:40:24,707 --> 00:40:25,808
I loved her.

00:40:25,808 --> 00:40:26,809
SIDLE:
No, you didn't.

00:40:26,809 --> 00:40:29,778
If you did, Jefferson,

00:40:29,778 --> 00:40:32,481
you would've pulled over.

00:40:42,558 --> 00:40:44,593
Call a cab?

00:40:44,593 --> 00:40:46,595
Thanks for getting
my money back.

00:40:46,595 --> 00:40:48,097
Or what was left of it.

00:40:48,097 --> 00:40:51,166
Either way it was
the cheapest divorce I ever had.

00:40:51,166 --> 00:40:52,835
(laughs)

00:40:52,835 --> 00:40:55,604
You know, you can convince
yourself all day long

00:40:55,604 --> 00:40:57,706
that you came down here
chasing after that money.

00:40:57,706 --> 00:40:59,875
But we both know the
truth, don't we?

00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:02,011
Look, the-the truth is...

00:41:02,011 --> 00:41:04,580
is that Helen got
what she deserved.

00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:07,082
Really? Okay, um, you know what?

00:41:07,082 --> 00:41:08,851
You can take off, bro.

00:41:08,851 --> 00:41:10,486
Whoa, whoa, whoa, that's my cab.

00:41:10,486 --> 00:41:11,887
No, no, that was your cab.

00:41:11,887 --> 00:41:14,556
Hey, what the hell's
going on here?

00:41:14,556 --> 00:41:15,657
Get your hands off of me!

00:41:15,657 --> 00:41:17,026
I am placing you
under arrest

00:41:17,026 --> 00:41:18,994
for felony assault.

00:41:18,994 --> 00:41:21,130
And in Nevada, that carries,
what, three to 13?

00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:23,465
I never touched her in Nevada.

00:41:23,465 --> 00:41:24,633
No, no, I'm not talking
about your ex-wife.

00:41:24,633 --> 00:41:25,634
I'm talking

00:41:25,634 --> 00:41:26,635
about my medical examiner,

00:41:26,635 --> 00:41:28,170
Doc Robbins.

00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:29,571
The guy on crutches

00:41:29,571 --> 00:41:30,572
that you pushed.

00:41:30,572 --> 00:41:32,141
Oh, come on, man!

00:41:32,141 --> 00:41:34,009
That's like hitting a cop.
Are you joking?

00:41:34,009 --> 00:41:35,744
The judge is gonna
laugh you out of court.

00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,079
Maybe he will,

00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:38,080
maybe he won't,
but it's, like,

00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,882
4:00 on a Friday afternoon.

00:41:39,882 --> 00:41:41,116
Nothing's gonna happen
till Monday morning.

00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:46,488
Have a good weekend.
