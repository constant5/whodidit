00:00:11,781 --> 00:00:13,783
MAN:
<i>Welcome to the Premiere,</i>

00:00:13,783 --> 00:00:16,952
<i>where every player's a star.</i>

00:00:16,952 --> 00:00:21,691
(slot machine tunes playing,
tokens clinking)

00:00:21,691 --> 00:00:24,593
MAN: <i>All right,</i>
<i>lucky number seven, here we go!</i>

00:00:26,562 --> 00:00:28,064
DEALER:
<i>Player has blackjack!</i>

00:00:28,064 --> 00:00:30,099
(players cheer)

00:00:30,099 --> 00:00:31,300
CROUPIER:
<i>No more bets.</i>

00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,902
<i>Roll seven.</i>

00:00:32,902 --> 00:00:36,005
MAN: <i>Come on, red, big money.</i>
<i>Come on!</i>

00:00:36,005 --> 00:00:37,139
(applause and cheering)

00:00:44,246 --> 00:00:47,183
(indistinct chatter
on police radio)

00:00:49,585 --> 00:00:51,020
SANDERS:
What do you think, Dave?

00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:54,323
Blunt force trauma
to the back of the skull.

00:00:54,323 --> 00:00:58,627
And her liver temp tells me
she's been dead about two hours.

00:01:00,029 --> 00:01:01,597
I.D.?

00:01:01,597 --> 00:01:03,566
No purse, no cell phone.

00:01:03,566 --> 00:01:04,800
Nothing.

00:01:06,736 --> 00:01:08,237
That is an elaborate model.

00:01:08,237 --> 00:01:09,672
Must be a story there, huh?

00:01:09,672 --> 00:01:11,607
The Premiere?
Yeah.

00:01:11,607 --> 00:01:13,676
It was Jack Witten's dream.

00:01:13,676 --> 00:01:16,112
In Jack Witten's house.

00:01:16,112 --> 00:01:17,613
I've never seen it before.

00:01:17,613 --> 00:01:19,648
Well, that's because
it was never built.

00:01:19,648 --> 00:01:21,951
I could write a book
about the Vegas that never was.

00:01:21,951 --> 00:01:25,020
So many casinos were imagined
and never realized.

00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,657
The most legendary of all,
The Premiere.

00:01:28,657 --> 00:01:30,893
It was Jack Witten's vision
to build a casino

00:01:30,893 --> 00:01:33,329
that resembled his father's
old Hollywood movie studio.

00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:36,165
What happened?
Well, like in the movies,

00:01:36,165 --> 00:01:38,934
the dream ended in scandal.

00:01:38,934 --> 00:01:42,104
Jack Witten lost his investors
when he became the prime suspect

00:01:42,104 --> 00:01:44,306
in the murder of a young woman.

00:01:44,306 --> 00:01:48,210
And here we are again.

00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:49,712
Nice house.

00:01:49,712 --> 00:01:50,946
Who lives here?

00:01:50,946 --> 00:01:52,681
BRASS: Jack Witten.
He's an odd duck.

00:01:52,681 --> 00:01:53,983
He's a modern-day
Howard Hughes.

00:01:53,983 --> 00:01:55,851
That's him,
right over there.

00:01:55,851 --> 00:01:57,820
A former party boy
turned recluse.

00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,722
Said he was downstairs
in the screening room,

00:01:59,722 --> 00:02:02,825
fell asleep, came up,
found the girl.

00:02:02,825 --> 00:02:04,794
Tried to revive her.
Called 911.

00:02:04,794 --> 00:02:06,796
Any sign of a break-in?
No.

00:02:06,796 --> 00:02:08,697
Just some wine bottles
and drug paraphernalia.

00:02:08,697 --> 00:02:11,567
You know, it's weird.
14 years ago,

00:02:11,567 --> 00:02:13,169
we had the guy
for the same crime.

00:02:13,169 --> 00:02:14,603
It's déjà vu
all over again.

00:02:14,603 --> 00:02:16,238
Why? What happened?

00:02:16,238 --> 00:02:18,808
We didn't have enough
evidence to make an arrest.

00:02:18,808 --> 00:02:21,076
Powerful guy? Connected?
Back then.

00:02:21,076 --> 00:02:23,279
Not anymore. Now he's shuffling
around in his slippers.

00:02:23,279 --> 00:02:24,880
Hey.
Hi.

00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,749
It's, uh, pretty
ugly in there.

00:02:26,749 --> 00:02:28,284
Have you seen Sara?

00:02:28,284 --> 00:02:30,886
Thought she was with you.

00:02:56,145 --> 00:02:58,581
I think we got
the son of a bitch.

00:02:58,581 --> 00:03:00,716
This had to come from
Jack Witten's house.

00:03:00,716 --> 00:03:02,084
It should be enough
for a warrant.

00:03:02,084 --> 00:03:03,886
Guy like Witten--
might not be that easy.

00:03:03,886 --> 00:03:05,221
What do you mean?

00:03:05,221 --> 00:03:07,323
This is Vegas, Sara.

00:03:09,191 --> 00:03:11,727
RUSSELL:
<i>Sara? Sara.</i>

00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:15,998
Got something?

00:03:15,998 --> 00:03:18,734
A piece of the past.
Yeah, I heard

00:03:18,734 --> 00:03:20,903
about this Witten guy.

00:03:20,903 --> 00:03:22,805
Are you thinking
that the strand has something

00:03:22,805 --> 00:03:24,306
to do
with the crime scene downstairs?

00:03:24,306 --> 00:03:27,042
Well, 14 years ago...

00:03:27,042 --> 00:03:29,078
I think the crime
scene was right here.

00:03:31,614 --> 00:03:33,849
Tell me about her.
Who--who was she?

00:03:33,849 --> 00:03:37,219
Darcy Blaine. 18.

00:03:37,219 --> 00:03:38,988
Jack Witten
picked her up at a bar.

00:03:38,988 --> 00:03:41,557
Security cameras caught
them leaving together.

00:03:41,557 --> 00:03:43,626
He had a thing
for younger girls.

00:03:43,626 --> 00:03:45,995
Darcy was never seen again.

00:03:45,995 --> 00:03:47,329
They never found her body.

00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:50,065
You think she was murdered
in this room?

00:03:51,834 --> 00:03:54,670
It was my first
high-profile case in Vegas.

00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:57,273
Catherine was supervising
in Grissom's absence.

00:03:57,273 --> 00:03:58,841
I got it.

00:03:58,841 --> 00:04:00,910
Witten's the one who got away.

00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:04,046
I've spent a lot of time
with Darcy's family.

00:04:04,046 --> 00:04:06,248
She was a troubled, wild kid

00:04:06,248 --> 00:04:07,816
who never had a chance
to find her way.

00:04:07,816 --> 00:04:09,551
I've been there.

00:04:09,551 --> 00:04:12,087
But we do have a girl that was
killed in this house tonight,

00:04:12,087 --> 00:04:14,690
so, let's focus on that, okay?

00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:17,226
Yeah, I am.

00:04:17,226 --> 00:04:21,697
I--I have waited a long time
to get into this room.

00:04:21,697 --> 00:04:23,766
And that girl downstairs
might still be alive,

00:04:23,766 --> 00:04:26,702
if we put Witten
away 14 years ago.

was a movie fanatic.

00:05:06,709 --> 00:05:09,510
Let's see what was
playing last night.

00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,679
Okay. Fade in.

00:05:11,679 --> 00:05:13,280
I'm Jack Witten.

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,382
Welcome to my sleazy sex pad.

00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:17,918
Glass of wine?
Why not?

00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:20,287
Glass of wine, little romance...

00:05:20,287 --> 00:05:21,589
But I get too frisky.

00:05:21,589 --> 00:05:23,157
You push me away...

00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:24,458
<i>and drop your wine glass.</i>

00:05:30,264 --> 00:05:31,732
Hmm.

00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:33,267
Little bits

00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:34,702
of cork in there.
Hmm.

00:05:34,702 --> 00:05:37,571
Nice bottle of wine.

00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:39,540
Did the cork break?

00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:42,910
Nope. Still intact.

00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:46,146
Weird.
Where'd that come from?

00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:48,182
I don't know.
Okay, so...

00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:50,517
date is over,
I'm out of here.

00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:51,719
That's the problem.

00:05:51,719 --> 00:05:53,320
<i>I want you to stay.</i>

00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,822
FINLAY: <i>So Witten</i>
<i>and the girl struggle,</i>

00:05:54,822 --> 00:05:56,423
<i>girl breaks free...</i>

00:05:57,658 --> 00:05:58,926
<i>Good night.</i>

00:06:00,728 --> 00:06:05,366
Blood on the lamp is consistent
with blunt force trauma.

00:06:05,366 --> 00:06:07,534
No castoff,

00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:09,403
which means
it was one blow.
Okay, so,

00:06:09,403 --> 00:06:12,373
Witten kills the girl,
calls 911, and then,

00:06:12,373 --> 00:06:14,241
plays it off
like an intruder came in

00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:15,776
while he was sleeping
downstairs.

00:06:15,776 --> 00:06:18,445
Yeah, and that is the worst
alibi ever, which,

00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:21,315
in my experience,
sometimes means that it's true.

00:06:21,315 --> 00:06:23,384
What do you mean?
Well, didn't you say

00:06:23,384 --> 00:06:27,254
that this guy killed a girl
and made her body disappear?

00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:28,889
Why didn't he just do it again?

00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:32,226
Maybe now he thinks
he's untouchable.

00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:35,663
Seems like old times.

00:06:35,663 --> 00:06:36,930
Right, Conrad?

00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:40,401
Some ways, yes,
some ways, no... Jack.

00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:43,404
Uh, Mr. Witten, I'm--I'm not
so interested in the past

00:06:43,404 --> 00:06:44,805
as I am in what happened
last night.

00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:46,907
I already told you.

00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:49,677
I was watching a film
in my basement screening room.

00:06:49,677 --> 00:06:52,846
Fell asleep to Jane Russell,

00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:54,648
<i>woke up to a horror show.</i>

00:06:54,648 --> 00:06:57,184
And you didn't
hear anything upstairs?

00:06:57,184 --> 00:06:58,919
Screening room's soundproofed.

00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,488
And the girl?

00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:02,923
Never saw her before.

00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:04,725
ECKLIE:
I'm so sorry, sir.

00:07:04,725 --> 00:07:07,394
I just need this to be clear.
You're saying that you never

00:07:07,394 --> 00:07:09,229
even met Darcy?
Did I stutter?

00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:10,931
You heard me.

00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:13,567
And this time, you people
aren't going to find me

00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:18,605
wasted on some B.S.
security video outside a club.

00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:21,208
Well, we may not
have video on you, but...

00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:22,743
we do have blood
on your hands, sir.

00:07:22,743 --> 00:07:24,344
ECKLIE:
Yeah, the victim's blood.

00:07:24,344 --> 00:07:26,413
How do you explain that?
I tried to help her.

00:07:26,413 --> 00:07:28,248
I got her blood on my hands.

00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:29,917
What do you want me to do?

00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:31,685
I won't play the sap for you.

00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:34,888
Humphrey Bogart...

00:07:34,888 --> 00:07:36,457
<i>Maltese Falcon,</i> right?

00:07:36,457 --> 00:07:37,758
You know it.

00:07:37,758 --> 00:07:39,259
A kindred spirit.

00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:40,728
RUSSELL:
He played Sam Spade,

00:07:40,728 --> 00:07:42,763
a private eye
everybody was lying to.

00:07:42,763 --> 00:07:44,698
ECKLIE: Yeah, that's me.
You've been lying

00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:47,634
for 14 years.

00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,369
You brought
this little girl home,

00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:50,871
just like you did Darcy Blaine.

00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:54,608
You know it,
and I know it.

00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:56,376
You don't know anything.

00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:59,313
You sure as hell
don't know me.

00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:01,381
You never did.

00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:03,283
Keep smiling, Jack.

00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:05,319
We didn't get
you for Darcy,

00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:07,321
but I promise you

00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:10,157
we're gonna nail you
for this one.

00:08:21,869 --> 00:08:24,538
SIDLE:
Hello, Conrad.

00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:27,207
Sara.

00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:30,177
Here to pull
the Darcy Blaine case files?

00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:32,613
Looks like you
beat me to it.

00:08:32,613 --> 00:08:34,581
Well,
great minds obsess alike.

00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:36,283
Yeah, well, I got a hunch
we're obsessing

00:08:36,283 --> 00:08:37,818
for different reasons.

00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:40,154
Huh. You're right.

00:08:41,488 --> 00:08:43,323
I'm really sorry.

00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:46,160
I should never have taken
this case away from you guys.

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,295
You can't do this, Conrad.
Yes, I can.

00:08:48,295 --> 00:08:49,630
Grissom is at a conference,

00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,898
and you don't have
the authority,

00:08:50,898 --> 00:08:52,733
so this case belongs
to day shift now.

00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:55,302
To me.
So you just decided
to stop looking at Jack Witten.

00:08:55,302 --> 00:08:57,805
At least let us get a warrant
for Witten's house.
No!

00:08:57,805 --> 00:08:59,306
I'm not gonna waste
valuable time

00:08:59,306 --> 00:09:00,774
and resources
on a witch hunt

00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:02,876
of a prominent man
whose family has done so much

00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,611
for this town.
God, you are so political.

00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:06,613
Well, that's an understatement.

00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:08,749
Look, Darcy Blaine
was a drug-addict rich girl

00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:10,317
slumming in Northtown.

00:09:10,317 --> 00:09:12,452
You've been looking
in the wrong place, Sidle,

00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:16,390
and you let her--it's time
the real pros took over.

00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,392
Feels like a lifetime ago.

00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:21,461
I was looking in the wrong place
or not looking at all.

00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:25,899
Security cam photos--
Witten and Darcy

00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:28,268
leaving the club.

00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:30,504
Later on,
in the parking garage.

00:09:30,504 --> 00:09:32,673
SIDLE: They drove away
together in her car.

00:09:32,673 --> 00:09:34,775
Next morning, it was found
on the edge of town.

00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:36,443
Trace on her tires

00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:38,378
said it was driven up
to Mount Charleston.

00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:40,547
Notorious body-dump site.

00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:42,449
There was a lot of blood.

00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:44,818
Exemplar from Darcy's father
proved it was hers.

00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:46,353
Yeah, and her blood
tested positive

00:09:46,353 --> 00:09:48,288
for cocaine and GHB, so she was

00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:51,658
definitely roofied.

00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:53,393
So what do you think happened
that night?

00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:54,928
Well...

00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,631
<i>Darcy Blaine</i> was <i>a drug addict.</i>

00:09:57,631 --> 00:09:59,766
<i>I think that Witten lured her</i>
<i>to his place</i>

00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:02,669
<i>with the promise of drugs,</i>
<i>and then he drugged her.</i>

00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:06,406
<i>Witten brought her upstairs.</i>

00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:07,875
<i>Darcy was out of it, but still</i>

00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,776
<i>she had some fight left in her.</i>
(Darcy grunts)

00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:14,214
(grunts)
<i>He kills her.</i>

00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:17,751
<i>Witten takes Darcy's body out</i>
<i>in her car</i>

00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:20,921
<i>and buries her somewhere</i>
<i>near Mount Charleston.</i>

00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:22,689
<i>He made one mistake.</i>

00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:25,492
<i>He left a carpet fiber</i>
<i>in the trunk.</i>

00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:27,427
Still bloody
after all these years.

00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:29,296
And...

00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:33,267
the carpet fiber
I took from Witten's bedroom.

00:10:33,267 --> 00:10:36,536
You just get that?
Uh-huh.

00:10:36,536 --> 00:10:38,772
That looks damn close.

00:10:38,772 --> 00:10:41,208
Hopefully, Hodges can confirm.

00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:47,714
Hey.
Hey.

00:10:47,714 --> 00:10:49,816
I got a hit
on the prints.

00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:52,519
Jane Doe from
Jack Witten's house

00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:55,188
is Gwenn Onetta.

00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:57,624
18. High school dropout.

00:10:57,624 --> 00:10:59,793
Three drug arrests
in the last year.

00:10:59,793 --> 00:11:03,430
Jack Witten's specialty--
young, vulnerable addicts.

00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:06,166
God, this guy's really gotten
under everybody's skin.

00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,835
It's not so much the guy--
it's the loss.

00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:12,172
Grissom assembled
an all-star team here.

00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:13,640
But ask any pro athlete.

00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,176
Most wins feel the same.

00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:18,645
It's the tough losses
that haunt you.

00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:20,747
So this is a rematch.

00:11:20,747 --> 00:11:23,450
Yeah.
I like it.

00:11:26,586 --> 00:11:28,722
Chip of glass in the head wound.

00:11:28,722 --> 00:11:31,892
Greg said there was a broken
wine glass at the scene.

00:11:31,892 --> 00:11:34,194
This doesn't look like
any wine glass.

00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:35,429
The lamp, maybe? The...

00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:37,698
The suspected murder weapon?

00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:39,232
Yeah, that could be.

00:11:40,634 --> 00:11:42,469
You know,
for the record, Morgan,

00:11:42,469 --> 00:11:44,438
I think you're
an all-star too.

00:11:44,438 --> 00:11:45,839
(laughs)

00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,174
Thanks, Doc.

00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:57,184
News on your fibers.

00:11:57,184 --> 00:11:58,719
Good news?
I hope they match.

00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:00,354
No, sorry.

00:12:00,354 --> 00:12:01,888
I know you wanted
a better answer.

00:12:03,857 --> 00:12:05,392
Who's that?

00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:06,860
Walter Blaine,
Darcy's father.

00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,662
He heard about Witten
and he wants to talk.

00:12:08,662 --> 00:12:11,398
Calls me every October
on the anniversary.

00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:14,701
Every year,
it's the same conversation.

00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:16,737
Sara, thanks much
for your time.

00:12:16,737 --> 00:12:19,306
Of course.
Please, have a seat.

00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:26,580
So, is today the day
we've been waiting for?

00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,449
Well, he's been brought in
for questioning.

00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:31,284
He did it again.

00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:33,253
That's all I can say, Walter.

00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:36,323
Please tell me you're gonna
get him this time.

00:12:36,323 --> 00:12:39,726
I promise that I will do
everything in my power

00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:40,927
to get justice for Darcy.

00:12:42,696 --> 00:12:45,665
She would've been 30 this year.

00:12:45,665 --> 00:12:47,200
Imagine that.

00:12:49,536 --> 00:12:51,905
(whispers):
She didn't deserve...

00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:53,840
(sighs)

00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:00,580
Aah...
closure's a myth.

00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:03,550
Doesn't exist.

00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:06,153
Look, I know
that bringing Witten down

00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:09,523
isn't gonna bring her back.

00:13:09,523 --> 00:13:12,259
But at least he'll never
be able to do it again.

00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:22,669
What are you doing?

00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:24,538
The fiber Sara pulled
from over there

00:13:24,538 --> 00:13:26,239
wasn't a match
to the bloody fiber

00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:28,241
from Darcy Blaine's trunk,

00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:31,478
so I'm thinking it must have
come from someplace else.

00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:33,747
Wow, you guys really
don't give up, do you?

00:13:33,747 --> 00:13:35,348
No, we don't.

00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:37,184
Especially since
we have a pretty good idea

00:13:37,184 --> 00:13:39,419
about what happened here
14 years ago.

00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:43,290
It's got to be somewhere.

00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,299
You know, I, uh, get

00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:53,800
that you want
to put this guy away.

00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,502
But don't you think
the best way to do that

00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:57,537
would be to
focus on last night?

00:14:08,648 --> 00:14:10,717
Did you find
what you're looking for?

00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:12,686
No.

00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:14,454
But maybe something better.

00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:16,189
It's desiccant gel--
like the kind

00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:18,525
used in pill bottles
to keep the contents dry.

00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:21,862
Uh-huh.
Removes excess moisture.

00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:25,265
And more cork.

00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:28,301
Maybe the cork downstairs
wasn't from a wine bottle.

00:14:30,604 --> 00:14:33,573
You know, Jack Witten's father
was a huge art collector.

00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:35,342
And he left everything
to Jack, but,

00:14:35,342 --> 00:14:39,279
I mean, these are all
movie posters.

00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,480
Where's the good stuff?

00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,482
What are you getting at?
You know,

00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:46,186
maybe what happened last night
didn't start in the bedroom.

00:14:46,186 --> 00:14:47,854
Maybe it started
in a Preservation Room.

00:14:47,854 --> 00:14:49,523
It's a sealed vault

00:14:49,523 --> 00:14:51,258
where collectors keep
their art.

00:14:51,258 --> 00:14:53,393
It's climate-controlled.

00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:57,564
Gel and cork are used
in the construction.

00:14:57,564 --> 00:15:00,634
Well, we've been
all over this place and, uh...

00:15:00,634 --> 00:15:02,736
haven't found
a Preservation Room.

00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:04,771
SANDERS:
Hey.

00:15:04,771 --> 00:15:07,307
There's a break
in the baseboard.

00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:10,610
(hollow thumping)

00:15:12,712 --> 00:15:14,247
Whoa.

00:15:20,654 --> 00:15:23,290
(muffled shouting)

00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,758
There's someone
in there.

00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:26,726
Need a password.

00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:29,596
We have to cut
through that door.

00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:33,300
Russell, it's Finn.
Send an emergency response team

00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,769
to Witten's house and tell them
to bring a plasma torch.

00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:37,170
We're in.

00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,738
How?
10-22-02,

00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:40,473
the day <i>The Premiere</i>
was supposed to open.

00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:42,576
(muffled cries)
LVPD!

00:15:49,849 --> 00:15:52,185
It's all right.
You're gonna be okay.

00:15:52,185 --> 00:15:55,789
Please. He tried to kill us.

00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:57,490
Me and my friend.

00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,893
Is she here? Is Gwen okay?

00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:10,270
(sighs)

00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,905
Emily,
I'm CSI Russell.

00:16:11,905 --> 00:16:13,473
And I'm CSI Sidle.

00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,475
Doc says that you're doing
a little better.

00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,310
Still feel a little dizzy.

00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,745
We could come back,
if you'd like.

00:16:18,745 --> 00:16:20,447
No. No, I want to help.

00:16:20,447 --> 00:16:21,748
RUSSELL:
Good, good.

00:16:21,748 --> 00:16:23,483
Do you think you can
take us through

00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:26,253
what happened last night?

00:16:26,253 --> 00:16:30,523
Me and Gwen, we met
this old guy at a club.

00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:32,225
He bought us champagne.

00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:35,495
I got drunk. Stupid.

00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,397
It's okay.

00:16:37,397 --> 00:16:39,299
We went back to his place.

00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:41,434
I needed to use the restroom.

00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:43,603
Said he'd show me.

00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:46,706
He pushed me
into that weird room.

00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:50,810
Tied me up, locked me in.

00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:55,448
Then... I could hear him.

00:16:55,448 --> 00:16:58,652
And I could hear her screaming,

00:16:58,652 --> 00:17:00,387
telling him to stop.

00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:05,825
I never should've
left Gwen alone.

00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:08,328
It's not your fault, Emily.

00:17:08,328 --> 00:17:10,597
So--so you were
in the Preservation Room

00:17:10,597 --> 00:17:12,365
when Witten attacked
your friend,

00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:14,601
is--is that right?

00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:17,304
Yeah. That's right.

00:17:17,304 --> 00:17:19,673
Okay.

00:17:19,673 --> 00:17:21,608
Can you call the doctor?

00:17:21,608 --> 00:17:23,209
I really feel awful.

00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:25,145
Of course.

00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:30,717
What was that about exactly?
Emily just told you

00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:33,219
that Witten locked her
in the Preservation Room.

00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:34,788
Yeah, she did.

00:17:34,788 --> 00:17:36,890
You don't believe her.
No, I didn't say that.

00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,458
But I do think
it's a little curious

00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:39,693
that she could hear so much.

00:17:39,693 --> 00:17:41,728
Locked in a vault,

00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:44,197
far away from the scene
of the crime.

00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:46,700
A--all I'm saying is
if you want him this time,

00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,501
you're gonna need more
than her statement.

00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:49,903
Yeah, and I'm gonna get
what I need.

00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:51,404
Okay.

00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:55,508
Hey, Sara, sometimes
you push too hard,

00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:56,910
and you know it.

00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:59,813
Just...don't.

00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,719
BRODY:
<i>So we got trace</i>

00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:07,754
on that piece of glass
that Doc pulled

00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:10,423
from our victim, Gwen Onetta.

00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,525
Did the glass come
from Witten's lamp?

00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:16,896
No. Density and refractive index
don't match.

00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:19,299
"Silica, sodium oxide,

00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:22,168
with a broadband
anti-reflective coating."

00:18:22,168 --> 00:18:25,372
Sounds like
a flashlight lens.
That's what I was thinking.

00:18:25,372 --> 00:18:27,340
Now, I followed up
on Emily Bridwell,

00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,676
our girl
in the hospital.

00:18:29,676 --> 00:18:31,778
Turns out, she was questioned

00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:33,580
in a string of burglaries
in Summerlin,

00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,682
along with her roommates,

00:18:35,682 --> 00:18:38,651
our girl in the morgue,
Gwen Onetta.

00:18:38,651 --> 00:18:40,620
Flashlights, burglaries...

00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,489
maybe these girls
weren't <i>invited</i>

00:18:42,489 --> 00:18:43,723
to Witten's house.

00:18:43,723 --> 00:18:45,492
Maybe they invited themselves.

00:18:45,492 --> 00:18:47,927
Pair of "Bling Ringers,"
Vegas-style?

00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:50,363
Wait a minute, just because
these girls were questioned

00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:52,499
in break-ins doesn't mean
that Witten's not guilty.

00:18:52,499 --> 00:18:54,467
The guy has a serious
security system,

00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:57,337
so how would these so-called
"Bling Ringers" get in

00:18:57,337 --> 00:18:59,305
in the first place,
let alone one of them end up

00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:00,707
in a locked vault?

00:19:00,707 --> 00:19:01,908
Those are all
good questions.

00:19:01,908 --> 00:19:04,377
Questions we know how to answer.

00:19:04,377 --> 00:19:06,413
Yeah, we need to get our hands
on that murder weapon.

00:19:06,413 --> 00:19:08,248
Find the flashlight.

00:19:08,248 --> 00:19:11,217
Haven't we turned that house
upside-down at this point?

00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:14,721
There is one room
we haven't searched yet.

00:19:58,331 --> 00:19:59,599
Hey, Sara...

00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:01,534
I found the murder weapon.

00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,570
Yeah, and it has
Emily Bridwell's prints on it.

00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:05,371
I know you've already
talked to her,

00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:07,540
but I think you might want
to have another conversation.

00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,542
Yeah, well, that's gonna
be a little difficult.

00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,678
She died in the hospital
two hours ago.

00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:14,147
I got to call you back.

00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:17,884
What the hell
happened?

00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:19,619
No Smurf jokes, please.

00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:21,821
Can you explain
this to me?

00:20:21,821 --> 00:20:24,524
C.O.D. is paralysis of
the respiratory system.

00:20:24,524 --> 00:20:27,360
My educated guess
is that it was caused

00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,496
by the ingestion of silver.

00:20:29,496 --> 00:20:32,732
Blue skin is the result
of a reaction called argyria.

00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:34,667
<i>Nanosilver's broken down</i>
<i>in the stomach,</i>

00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:38,371
<i>absorbed into the bloodstream</i>
<i>as a salt</i>

00:20:38,371 --> 00:20:41,407
<i>and then deposited in the skin,</i>
<i>where exposure to light</i>

00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:43,910
<i>turns the salt back</i>
<i>into elemental silver,</i>

00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,446
<i>creating the skin's bluish hue.</i>

00:20:46,446 --> 00:20:48,348
How would
she have ingested silver?

00:20:48,348 --> 00:20:49,849
I was just about to find out.

00:20:58,157 --> 00:20:59,325
Whoa.

00:21:03,162 --> 00:21:05,431
What is that?

00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:07,300
It looks like film.

00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:11,905
ECKLIE: Okay, it's official.
I've seen everything.

00:21:11,905 --> 00:21:14,807
This girl died from
swallowing a roll of film?

00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:17,343
We know what's on it?

00:21:17,343 --> 00:21:19,145
Hodges is working on it.

00:21:19,145 --> 00:21:21,281
Patrol found
Emily Bridwell's car

00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:22,815
a block away
from Witten's house.

00:21:22,815 --> 00:21:24,884
And a Post-it
with his address

00:21:24,884 --> 00:21:26,586
and security codes.

00:21:26,586 --> 00:21:28,821
Even the password
to the Preservation Room.

00:21:28,821 --> 00:21:30,924
So these girls,
they were targeting

00:21:30,924 --> 00:21:32,592
Jack Witten's secret vault?

00:21:32,592 --> 00:21:34,727
Yes.
Then,
for some reason,

00:21:34,727 --> 00:21:36,863
the partnership went south.

00:21:36,863 --> 00:21:38,464
FINLAY:
And I think I know why.

00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:39,933
No honor among thieves.

00:21:39,933 --> 00:21:41,768
Especially when you're banging
the same guy.

00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:45,872
I checked Gwen's
cell phone records.

00:21:45,872 --> 00:21:48,274
<i>Turns out Emily's boyfriend</i>
<i>texted her</i>

00:21:48,274 --> 00:21:49,809
<i>at a very inconvenient time.</i>

00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:52,211
(phone chimes)

00:21:52,211 --> 00:21:54,380
EMILY (chuckling):
What the...

00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,916
You bitch! You're screwing Ryan?

00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,351
Emily, chill out.

00:21:58,351 --> 00:21:59,719
It's Ryan. Come on.

00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:01,187
He said you weren't
that into him.

00:22:01,187 --> 00:22:02,355
Screw you!

00:22:02,355 --> 00:22:03,623
(grunting)

00:22:05,191 --> 00:22:07,260
GWEN:
Get off of me!
(groans)

00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,562
I'm out of here.

00:22:11,364 --> 00:22:13,199
EMILY: You're not
going anywhere.

00:22:13,199 --> 00:22:15,168
(grunting)

00:22:15,168 --> 00:22:16,502
(glass shatters)

00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:17,737
What is wrong with you?!

00:22:17,737 --> 00:22:18,871
(thud, Gwen screams)

00:22:21,441 --> 00:22:25,311
So Emily kills Gwen
in a jealous rage.

00:22:25,311 --> 00:22:27,747
At this point, you'd
think, you'd run.

00:22:27,747 --> 00:22:29,816
But she has to get
what she came for.

00:22:33,219 --> 00:22:35,355
FINLAY:
<i>She finds the film...</i>

00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:37,390
WITTEN: Yeah, I've got
a dead girl in my living room.

00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:39,158
<i>...but she hears</i>
<i>Jack Witten downstairs.</i>

00:22:39,158 --> 00:22:40,526
Just get somebody
out here!

00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:42,428
<i>But she knows the house,</i>

00:22:42,428 --> 00:22:45,765
<i>and she knows his reputation,</i>
<i>so she improvises.</i>

00:22:45,765 --> 00:22:48,167
<i>Locks herself in the vault,</i>

00:22:48,167 --> 00:22:51,804
<i>hides the flashlight...</i>

00:22:51,804 --> 00:22:55,141
<i>swallows the film...</i>

00:22:55,141 --> 00:22:57,877
<i>and ties herself up.</i>

00:22:57,877 --> 00:23:01,614
<i>And then</i>
<i>she makes up her story.</i>

00:23:01,614 --> 00:23:03,716
But I guess that
clears Witten, huh?

00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:05,518
Yeah, at least
for last night.

00:23:05,518 --> 00:23:07,153
RUSSELL: What
I want to know is,

00:23:07,153 --> 00:23:08,721
what's so important
on this piece of film

00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:11,691
that that girl would
mule it out of there?

00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:41,421
My God.

00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:42,622
Is that who I think it is?

00:23:42,622 --> 00:23:43,790
Was.

00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,362
I forgot how
young she looked.

00:23:51,831 --> 00:23:54,333
Darcy Blaine.

00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:55,501
Ghost from the past.

00:24:03,276 --> 00:24:05,845
Well, she's definitely
in Boulder City.

00:24:05,845 --> 00:24:08,181
And I recognize these banners
from the Millennium.

00:24:08,181 --> 00:24:10,149
So it's got to be 2000.

00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:13,219
So this film
that was shot of Darcy,
clearly before she died,

00:24:13,219 --> 00:24:15,588
has been in Witten's vault
this whole time?

00:24:15,588 --> 00:24:17,557
It would seem so.

00:24:17,557 --> 00:24:19,559
You see the way she's
looking in the camera?

00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:23,329
She's flirting.
And Witten claims that
he never met Darcy before

00:24:23,329 --> 00:24:24,931
the night they walked
out of the club together.

00:24:24,931 --> 00:24:26,432
The look in her eyes
says that there

00:24:26,432 --> 00:24:28,267
was a lot more
to the relationship than that.

00:24:28,267 --> 00:24:30,570
This film proves that everything
he said about Darcy is a lie.

00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:33,239
Not only did they know
each other, they were
probably having sex.

00:24:33,239 --> 00:24:37,243
Well, Witten was released today.
I say we go over to his house,

00:24:37,243 --> 00:24:39,645
shove those in his face and
force a confession out of him.

00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:41,380
SIDLE:
Uh, wait a minute.

00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,316
If we know he's guilty,
somebody else does too.

00:24:43,316 --> 00:24:45,618
Whoever sent our thieves
in there to steal the film.

00:24:45,618 --> 00:24:47,553
Well, it's got to be
someone who knows Witten.

00:24:47,553 --> 00:24:49,422
They knew the house,
they knew the security codes,

00:24:49,422 --> 00:24:50,690
and they knew
that he had the film.

00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:53,192
But how would
they know about it?

00:24:53,192 --> 00:24:55,328
Maybe because they're
the ones who shot it.

00:24:55,328 --> 00:24:57,430
Did you test
the film itself?

00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:58,798
I did.

00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:01,501
I found exactly
300 frames

00:25:01,501 --> 00:25:04,470
of nitrocellulose-based
film print,

00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:06,839
manufactured
sometime before 1952.

00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:09,542
Well, that makes sense.
When planning the premiere,

00:25:09,542 --> 00:25:11,611
Witten hired a bunch
of photographers

00:25:11,611 --> 00:25:13,312
to use vintage cameras

00:25:13,312 --> 00:25:14,847
to shoot
on vintage film.

00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:17,216
Maybe one of the cameramen
shot footage of Darcy

00:25:17,216 --> 00:25:19,285
for Witten's personal use too.
Someone like that

00:25:19,285 --> 00:25:21,654
would know more
intimate details about
their relationship.

00:25:21,654 --> 00:25:23,856
They might even know the truth
of how Darcy died.

00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:27,326
But why steal the film now,
14 years later?

00:25:27,326 --> 00:25:29,662
I don't know, maybe the guy
fell on hard times.

00:25:29,662 --> 00:25:31,764
It's never too late
to blackmail.
All right.

00:25:31,764 --> 00:25:33,666
Okay, let's say
we're right.

00:25:33,666 --> 00:25:35,868
How do we find
the cameraperson
that shot this?

00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:39,205
"Shot" is
the operative word here.

00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:41,674
A strip of film
is like a bullet.

00:25:41,674 --> 00:25:44,877
<i>Just like a gun creates unique</i>
<i>rifling impressions on a round,</i>

00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:47,613
<i>the pressure plate in a camera</i>

00:25:47,613 --> 00:25:51,184
<i>imprints unique scratches</i>
<i>on film.</i>

00:25:51,184 --> 00:25:53,886
These scratch patterns,
they can help us

00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:55,788
find the camera
that shot this film.

00:25:55,788 --> 00:25:59,659
So find the camera...
maybe find the cameraman.

00:25:59,659 --> 00:26:01,594
HODGES:
<i>And...</i>

00:26:01,594 --> 00:26:02,762
action.

00:26:02,762 --> 00:26:04,697
No, no, no,
no, no, no.

00:26:04,697 --> 00:26:06,332
It's a sexy walk.

00:26:06,332 --> 00:26:07,934
And look into camera.
Give me a little smile.

00:26:07,934 --> 00:26:09,402
What difference
does it make?

00:26:09,402 --> 00:26:11,838
We're testing
the film <i>stock,</i> right?

00:26:11,838 --> 00:26:13,906
Please don't tell me
how to direct.

00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:15,641
All right.

00:26:15,641 --> 00:26:16,909
And...

00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:18,678
action.

00:26:18,678 --> 00:26:20,580
Okay, not bad.

00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,481
Got that one.
Go back to the one.

00:26:22,481 --> 00:26:24,450
Little happier this time.
Action.

00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:26,452
Okay, that's better.
In with a wink.

00:26:26,452 --> 00:26:28,521
Stop, wink, and cut. Okay.

00:26:28,521 --> 00:26:29,889
This feels weird.

00:26:29,889 --> 00:26:31,357
You're a scared little lady.

00:26:31,357 --> 00:26:32,792
Uh-huh. No, no,
just... Okay.

00:26:32,792 --> 00:26:34,260
Cut. Never mind.

00:26:35,828 --> 00:26:37,230
Silent film.

00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:38,831
And cut. Great.

00:26:38,831 --> 00:26:40,299
You're Marilyn Monroe.

00:26:40,299 --> 00:26:41,734
Just the slinkiest,
sexiest lady

00:26:41,734 --> 00:26:43,135
you've ever been.

00:26:43,135 --> 00:26:44,737
Looks great.

00:26:44,737 --> 00:26:48,441
Okay, okay, no, that's...
that's too sexy.

00:26:48,441 --> 00:26:49,842
HODGES:
I located five vintage

00:26:49,842 --> 00:26:51,878
35-millimeter cameras
in the Vegas area.

00:26:51,878 --> 00:26:54,247
Two from WLVU's
film department

00:26:54,247 --> 00:26:55,681
and three from
a seedy pawnshop.

00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:59,218
Scratch pattern
is identical.

00:26:59,218 --> 00:27:00,453
Which camera was it?

00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:02,221
This little baby here.

00:27:02,221 --> 00:27:04,423
Arriflex 2C.

00:27:04,423 --> 00:27:08,527
Sold to the pawnshop two months
ago by a guy named Bob Geer.

00:27:08,527 --> 00:27:10,863
He was a cameraman
employed by Jack Witten.

00:27:10,863 --> 00:27:14,567
And PD is pulling
an address right now.

00:27:14,567 --> 00:27:16,168
MAN:
<i>Robert Geer.</i>

00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:22,775
Robert Geer. LVPD.

00:27:23,843 --> 00:27:25,511
Mr. Geer?

00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,448
Hello?

00:27:53,706 --> 00:27:55,207
Been dead a while.

00:28:03,249 --> 00:28:07,753
C.O.D. on our cameraman was
a single gunshot to the head.

00:28:07,753 --> 00:28:10,623
.22--same caliber as a gun

00:28:10,623 --> 00:28:12,224
registered to Jack Witten.

00:28:12,224 --> 00:28:14,627
All right, but .22's
a pretty common gun.

00:28:14,627 --> 00:28:16,295
Doesn't necessarily
point to Witten.

00:28:16,295 --> 00:28:17,863
This does.

00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:20,299
Geer's bank records
going back to 2000.

00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:23,336
RUSSELL:
Wow. $750,000 transferred

00:28:23,336 --> 00:28:24,737
into Geer's account from

00:28:24,737 --> 00:28:27,540
Iris Corp? What's that?
That is an LLC

00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,909
that Witten formed
to build his casino.

00:28:29,909 --> 00:28:31,811
I think it's blackmail money.

00:28:31,811 --> 00:28:34,480
Witten paid off Geer
because Geer knew

00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,415
that he had killed
Darcy, is that right?

00:28:36,415 --> 00:28:39,251
Yes, and then 14 years later,
he's run through the money.

00:28:39,251 --> 00:28:40,486
He needs more.

00:28:40,486 --> 00:28:41,921
But this time,
his word against Witten

00:28:41,921 --> 00:28:43,522
isn't gonna be enough.

00:28:43,522 --> 00:28:45,424
Right, this time he
needs concrete proof

00:28:45,424 --> 00:28:47,293
of Witten's relationship
with Darcy.

00:28:47,293 --> 00:28:48,928
Hence the film.

00:28:48,928 --> 00:28:51,697
And the Post-it that we found
in Emily Bridwell's car

00:28:51,697 --> 00:28:54,767
with Witten's address
and security codes on it?

00:28:54,767 --> 00:28:56,902
It's in Bob Geer's
handwriting.

00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:59,238
He hired our thieves.

00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:02,375
So it looks like Geer,
after all this time,

00:29:02,375 --> 00:29:06,445
decided to put the pinch
on Witten again. Okay.

00:29:06,445 --> 00:29:08,147
So the guy worked for me.

00:29:08,147 --> 00:29:09,582
Everybody knows that.
But Geer

00:29:09,582 --> 00:29:12,351
knew about you and Darcy.
He came back

00:29:12,351 --> 00:29:13,853
for more money,
so you killed him.

00:29:13,853 --> 00:29:16,222
(chuckles)
Here we go again.

00:29:16,222 --> 00:29:17,690
BRASS: But this time
it's gonna stick.

00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:19,458
We pulled a .22-caliber bullet

00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:22,261
out of Geer's head--
same caliber as your gun.

00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:23,829
We're running it now.
I didn't do it.

00:29:23,829 --> 00:29:25,364
Wha...

00:29:25,364 --> 00:29:28,567
I haven't seen Geer in...
forever.

00:29:28,567 --> 00:29:30,269
I barely knew the guy.

00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:32,538
Just like I barely
knew Darcy.

00:29:32,538 --> 00:29:34,440
When are you guys
gonna give up?

00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,843
For someone you barely knew, you
sure had a serious obsession.

00:29:45,151 --> 00:29:47,420
Your buddy Geer shot that
for you, didn't he?

00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:49,422
You been keeping it
all these years.

00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:55,694
I've never seen that before.

00:29:55,694 --> 00:29:57,396
Oh, come on, Jack,
you're getting high

00:29:57,396 --> 00:29:59,398
with a wild party girl
and 500-a-night...

00:29:59,398 --> 00:30:01,400
No, no. No, no.
Darcy wasn't like that.

00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,235
She had a problem, just like me.

00:30:03,235 --> 00:30:05,504
What problem was that, Jack?

00:30:05,504 --> 00:30:06,639
I met her at N.A.

00:30:09,842 --> 00:30:12,178
She was a mixed-up girl.

00:30:12,178 --> 00:30:14,680
She liked old movies.

00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,615
We used to...

00:30:16,615 --> 00:30:18,584
watch them in my
screening room together.

00:30:18,584 --> 00:30:20,920
She got a kick out of
the old actresses, you know?

00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:24,256
Bergman, Vivien Leigh,
Gene Tierney in <i>Laura.</i>

00:30:26,358 --> 00:30:28,928
Darcy was a bright girl.

00:30:28,928 --> 00:30:30,896
She had better things
ahead of her.

00:30:30,896 --> 00:30:34,300
Yeah, I get it.
No, it wasn't like that.

00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,768
She was like
a daughter to me.

00:30:37,403 --> 00:30:39,238
(sighs)

00:30:39,238 --> 00:30:40,806
But I was a broken man. I...

00:30:42,741 --> 00:30:44,410
...couldn't control myself.

00:30:47,413 --> 00:30:48,881
With drugs...

00:30:48,881 --> 00:30:51,250
with women.
With Darcy.

00:30:54,587 --> 00:30:55,855
Yeah, with Darcy.

00:30:58,891 --> 00:31:01,760
And for years, I tried telling
myself it never happened.

00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,164
<i>We were together at the club.</i>

00:31:05,164 --> 00:31:09,535
<i>Next thing I knew,</i>
<i>Darcy was lying there, dead.</i>

00:31:09,535 --> 00:31:11,203
<i>And I forgot</i>
<i>Bob Geer was coming over</i>

00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:12,404
<i>to the house that morning.</i>

00:31:12,404 --> 00:31:13,606
I have no idea
what happened.

00:31:13,606 --> 00:31:15,141
GEER:
Stay cool, Jack.

00:31:15,141 --> 00:31:16,809
Let me handle this, okay?

00:31:16,809 --> 00:31:18,377
He said he could help me.

00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:20,346
Help you get rid
of the body?

00:31:20,346 --> 00:31:21,580
Yeah.

00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:26,452
But the one thing he
didn't tell me was...

00:31:26,452 --> 00:31:29,188
how much it was gonna cost me.

00:31:29,188 --> 00:31:30,856
All this time,
you guys

00:31:30,856 --> 00:31:32,858
have been trying to prove
I'm a killer.

00:31:32,858 --> 00:31:35,227
I got your proof.

00:31:40,432 --> 00:31:42,334
When I was cleaning up,

00:31:42,334 --> 00:31:44,537
Geer took this picture of Darcy.

00:31:48,908 --> 00:31:51,477
Sometimes I forget
what I did.

00:31:51,477 --> 00:31:54,914
So I kept this.

00:31:54,914 --> 00:31:58,651
So I never forget
the kind of person I really am.

00:32:00,886 --> 00:32:03,522
I just heard--
Witten confessed.

00:32:03,522 --> 00:32:05,424
(sighs):
Yeah.

00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:07,826
Uh, thought
you'd be happier.

00:32:07,826 --> 00:32:10,262
Ballistics just came back
on the bullet that killed Geer.

00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:12,164
It wasn't a match
to Witten's gun.

00:32:12,164 --> 00:32:14,333
Okay, so maybe Witten had
someone else do it for him.

00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:15,834
We still have him for Darcy.

00:32:15,834 --> 00:32:17,770
Yeah, I'm not so sure
about that, either, anymore.

00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:19,605
Witten said that he'd never seen

00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:21,907
that old film of Darcy before;
he was telling the truth.

00:32:21,907 --> 00:32:23,542
What do you mean?

00:32:23,542 --> 00:32:25,477
This film collection
in Witten's vault

00:32:25,477 --> 00:32:27,213
was a recent
acquisition.

00:32:28,681 --> 00:32:31,217
The film canisters
belonged to Bob Geer?

00:32:31,217 --> 00:32:32,585
Up until a month ago.

00:32:32,585 --> 00:32:34,420
At which time, he pawned
his vintage camera

00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,754
and all his film,
including the can

00:32:35,754 --> 00:32:37,590
that had 300 frames
of Darcy Blaine.

00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:39,558
I spoke to
the pawnshop owner.

00:32:39,558 --> 00:32:41,460
He said that a regular--
one of his collectors--

00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:45,297
bought all the film--that
collector was Jack Witten.

00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:48,601
We've been thinking that
Bob Geer wanted to get ahold

00:32:48,601 --> 00:32:50,336
of that film of Darcy
so that he could prove

00:32:50,336 --> 00:32:52,605
that Witten was lying
about their relationship--

00:32:52,605 --> 00:32:56,408
but why go after
that film if he had
something even better?

00:32:56,408 --> 00:32:59,278
SANDERS: Yeah, not just proof
of their relationship, but...

00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:01,447
proof of murder.

00:33:01,447 --> 00:33:02,648
This doesn't make any sense.

00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:04,650
What am I looking at?
The tox panel

00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:07,419
on Darcy Blaine's blood
that we found in the car trunk

00:33:07,419 --> 00:33:09,622
definitely had high
levels of cocaine, but...

00:33:09,622 --> 00:33:11,924
we're saying that
she was roofied, right?

00:33:11,924 --> 00:33:13,492
Right.

00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:15,594
Well, it's weird
because the GHB

00:33:15,594 --> 00:33:17,763
was never fully metabolized
into her blood.

00:33:17,763 --> 00:33:21,233
Meaning what?
It just doesn't
make sense.

00:33:21,233 --> 00:33:24,470
Greg, you are a great tech.

00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:26,338
And I know that you want
to be in the field.

00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:28,741
In this job, sometimes you got
to go beyond numbers.

00:33:28,741 --> 00:33:31,277
Beyond what's
on the face of things.

00:33:36,215 --> 00:33:37,549
What are you thinking about?

00:33:39,451 --> 00:33:42,421
Something Catherine once told me
about looking deeper.

00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:47,660
The Tin Man's rivet.

00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:50,296
Uh, for the most recent
reissue of <i>The Wizard of Oz,</i>

00:33:50,296 --> 00:33:52,331
they used a new
restoration technique.

00:33:52,331 --> 00:33:56,135
Details that had been lost
had suddenly now become vivid.

00:33:56,135 --> 00:33:58,871
One of those being
that the Tin Man had a rivet

00:33:58,871 --> 00:34:02,207
between his eyes that nobody
had seen in 50 years.

00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:05,577
Maybe there's some detail in
this film that we're not seeing.

00:34:05,577 --> 00:34:07,212
There's only one way
to find out.

00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:09,148
I'll send this
to FotoKem, have them

00:34:09,148 --> 00:34:11,417
do a wet print and rescan it.

00:34:22,494 --> 00:34:24,463
January 2001.

00:34:24,463 --> 00:34:26,799
The bank was torn
down in '05,

00:34:26,799 --> 00:34:29,201
but I remembered
it had a news ticker.

00:34:30,769 --> 00:34:32,538
That film was shot

00:34:32,538 --> 00:34:35,808
two months after Darcy Blaine
was supposedly murdered.

00:34:35,808 --> 00:34:37,810
She faked her death.

00:34:39,678 --> 00:34:41,413
SANDERS:
And she's smiling at the camera

00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:43,315
because she got
away with it.

00:35:00,165 --> 00:35:01,367
Darcy.

00:35:01,367 --> 00:35:02,701
I've been
looking for you.

00:35:02,701 --> 00:35:05,571
Sorry, my name's Vivian.

00:35:05,571 --> 00:35:07,606
Oh, right, uh,
"Vivian Sinclair."

00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:09,908
We found that
in Bob Geer's cell phone.

00:35:09,908 --> 00:35:12,411
"Vivian" as in "Vivien Leigh,"
your favorite movie star

00:35:12,411 --> 00:35:15,180
and "Sinclair," as in
your mother's maiden name.

00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,782
Hotel Blanc said
that Vivian Sinclair

00:35:16,782 --> 00:35:20,486
was checking out tonight,
heading home to Chicago.

00:35:20,486 --> 00:35:23,489
Sorry to delay
your flight.

00:35:23,489 --> 00:35:25,824
You're making
a big mistake.

00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:27,893
SIDLE:
You're the one who made
a big mistake.

00:35:27,893 --> 00:35:31,330
Bob Geer's phone records shows
a "Vivian Sinclair" called him

00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:33,465
20 minutes
before he was murdered.

00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:34,933
Cell tower hit
puts you a block away

00:35:34,933 --> 00:35:36,635
from his apartment,
it puts you there.

00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:38,504
We found a gun
in your suitcase, a .22.

00:35:38,504 --> 00:35:41,373
Ballistics confirms
that it's the murder weapon.

00:35:41,373 --> 00:35:44,309
He... It was self-defense.
He attacked me.

00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:47,546
All right.

00:35:47,546 --> 00:35:50,182
14 years ago...

00:35:50,182 --> 00:35:53,685
we put ourselves on the line
for an innocent girl

00:35:53,685 --> 00:35:54,820
we thought had been murdered.

00:35:56,155 --> 00:35:57,689
You manipulated the evidence,

00:35:57,689 --> 00:35:59,558
you put
an innocent man through hell.

00:35:59,558 --> 00:36:01,560
That night, you and Jack Witten
were at the club,

00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,262
you did go home together.

00:36:03,262 --> 00:36:05,164
<i>But it wasn't you</i>
<i>who blacked out,</i>

00:36:05,164 --> 00:36:07,633
<i>it was Witten,</i>
<i>like most nights.</i>

00:36:07,633 --> 00:36:10,469
<i>Once he was out, you called</i>
<i>your friend, Bob Geer.</i>

00:36:10,469 --> 00:36:12,438
Bob? He's out.

00:36:12,438 --> 00:36:14,406
Let's do this.

00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:20,512
SIDLE: <i>Witten woke up</i>
<i>in a drug haze, panicked.</i>

00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:23,449
<i>Just like you planned, Bob Geer</i>
<i>showed up in the morning,</i>

00:36:23,449 --> 00:36:25,284
<i>told Witten</i>
<i>he'd take care of things.</i>

00:36:25,284 --> 00:36:28,320
(camera shutter clicking)

00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,589
<i>And then, you two</i>
<i>took care of things.</i>

00:36:30,589 --> 00:36:34,359
(laughing)

00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:35,894
(laughs)

00:36:35,894 --> 00:36:37,663
SIDLE:
<i>You drew your own blood.</i>

00:36:37,663 --> 00:36:40,165
<i>You made it look like</i>
<i>you'd been roofied.</i>

00:36:40,165 --> 00:36:42,935
<i>And then you planted it</i>
<i>in your car trunk.</i>

00:36:46,205 --> 00:36:48,140
<i>You framed Jack Witten.</i>

00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,875
The man that was trying
to help you.

00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:52,911
You think Witten was trying
to help me?

00:36:52,911 --> 00:36:55,247
You don't know
Jack Witten.

00:36:55,247 --> 00:36:56,782
He was like
every other man in my life--

00:36:56,782 --> 00:36:58,417
just trying to use me.

00:36:58,417 --> 00:37:00,419
Is that the story
that you're going with?

00:37:00,419 --> 00:37:02,287
I got one. Bob Geer.

00:37:02,287 --> 00:37:04,289
Seems like
he wasn't using you.

00:37:04,289 --> 00:37:05,791
Seems to me he was
trying to help you.

00:37:05,791 --> 00:37:08,360
Phone records show that he
reached out to you six weeks ago

00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,662
when he realized
that his film collection

00:37:10,662 --> 00:37:12,664
had fallen
into the hands of Jack Witten,

00:37:12,664 --> 00:37:14,500
including 300 frames

00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,802
that prove...

00:37:16,802 --> 00:37:19,271
that this was a lie.

00:37:19,271 --> 00:37:20,405
Dead girl.

00:37:21,773 --> 00:37:23,442
Dead girl walking.

00:37:28,347 --> 00:37:30,716
I did a terrible thing.

00:37:30,716 --> 00:37:32,417
I was a mixed-up junkie.

00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:35,254
I was desperate
and afraid.

00:37:35,254 --> 00:37:36,455
Yeah.

00:37:36,455 --> 00:37:39,358
Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:41,894
Geer and I framed Jack Witten.

00:37:43,896 --> 00:37:46,465
But it was just a way
for me to escape.

00:37:46,465 --> 00:37:48,233
Escape from what?

00:37:48,233 --> 00:37:51,436
From my father,

00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:54,773
who, I'm sure,
was devastated at my loss.

00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:56,441
You know why?

00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:58,210
Because with me gone,

00:37:58,210 --> 00:37:59,811
he couldn't come into my bed
every night

00:37:59,811 --> 00:38:01,146
when my mother was asleep.

00:38:02,881 --> 00:38:05,551
I did what I had to do
to protect myself.

00:38:05,551 --> 00:38:07,286
SIDLE:
Tell that to Bob Geer.

00:38:07,286 --> 00:38:08,587
(laughs)

00:38:08,587 --> 00:38:11,690
I'm not a cold-blooded killer.

00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:12,925
I'm a mom!

00:38:12,925 --> 00:38:14,426
I have two girls.

00:38:14,426 --> 00:38:15,928
I have a husband
and a life that I cherish.

00:38:15,928 --> 00:38:19,164
I am not...
I'm not this person anymore.

00:38:19,164 --> 00:38:21,433
People can change.

00:38:25,604 --> 00:38:28,440
Terrible...

00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,609
unspeakable things happen
to all of us,

00:38:30,609 --> 00:38:32,811
but...

00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:35,847
that doesn't give anyone the
right to destroy someone's life.

00:38:35,847 --> 00:38:38,250
Whatever happened to you,

00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:41,653
whatever the truth is,
for 14 years,

00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:43,355
you let an innocent man believe

00:38:43,355 --> 00:38:45,457
that he killed the one thing
that he cared about.

00:38:45,457 --> 00:38:47,459
The one person
in his screwed-up universe

00:38:47,459 --> 00:38:50,362
that he genuinely loved
like a daughter.

00:38:50,362 --> 00:38:53,432
You took his desire
to protect and save you,

00:38:53,432 --> 00:38:54,866
and you perverted it.

00:38:54,866 --> 00:38:57,836
You twisted it.

00:38:57,836 --> 00:38:59,638
I know you.

00:38:59,638 --> 00:39:01,740
I know who you are.

00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:04,876
You haven't changed, Darcy.

00:39:04,876 --> 00:39:06,378
You never will.

00:39:13,552 --> 00:39:14,753
Thank you.

00:39:14,753 --> 00:39:16,221
(sighs)

00:39:16,221 --> 00:39:18,690
Walter Blaine has
hired counsel for Darcy.

00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:22,160
He's wrapped his fatherly arms
around his daughter.

00:39:24,429 --> 00:39:26,231
Do you believe her?

00:39:26,231 --> 00:39:27,899
Her story about
him molesting her?

00:39:27,899 --> 00:39:30,702
She's definitely screwed up.

00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:33,405
Maybe it's from abuse.

00:39:33,405 --> 00:39:36,875
Maybe...she's just a bad seed.

00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:39,277
I don't know what
to believe anymore.

00:39:39,277 --> 00:39:40,712
Oh, I know that feeling.

00:39:45,517 --> 00:39:47,919
That thing I said to you
about pushing too hard...

00:39:50,689 --> 00:39:52,357
Thank God you did.

00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:01,199
You're a free man, Jack.

00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,806
What's going to
happen to her?

00:40:10,242 --> 00:40:12,911
ECKLIE:
I wouldn't think you'd care.

00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:16,715
All these years,
and I thought I'd killed her.

00:40:16,715 --> 00:40:18,684
Had to live with that.

00:40:18,684 --> 00:40:20,619
Now, I just keep thinking

00:40:20,619 --> 00:40:22,220
I could've done more
to save her.

00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:24,456
Hey, it wasn't your fault.

00:40:24,456 --> 00:40:25,891
She made her own choices.

00:40:25,891 --> 00:40:27,626
Yeah.

00:40:29,394 --> 00:40:32,197
Look, Jack, uh...

00:40:32,197 --> 00:40:33,398
I'm sorry.

00:40:33,398 --> 00:40:36,368
No apologies.

00:40:36,368 --> 00:40:38,136
You guys did your job.

00:40:40,272 --> 00:40:42,808
Thanks for giving me
my life back.

00:40:55,854 --> 00:40:57,222
(sighs)

00:41:02,327 --> 00:41:04,863
Well, it's lights out

00:41:04,863 --> 00:41:06,298
for <i>The Premiere.</i>

00:41:06,298 --> 00:41:07,499
Witten can
still build it.

00:41:07,499 --> 00:41:09,334
Ah, it wouldn't work.

00:41:09,334 --> 00:41:11,470
Too innocent for Vegas
these days.

00:41:17,175 --> 00:41:19,177
Speaking of another time...

00:41:19,177 --> 00:41:20,712
(laughs)

00:41:20,712 --> 00:41:21,913
Please put that away.

00:41:21,913 --> 00:41:24,449
(laughs)

00:41:24,449 --> 00:41:25,784
(sighs)

00:41:28,386 --> 00:41:29,855
All this evidence,

00:41:29,855 --> 00:41:31,490
all these years.

00:41:33,158 --> 00:41:35,327
You ever think
you've had enough?

00:41:35,327 --> 00:41:37,429
Are you kidding?

00:41:37,429 --> 00:41:39,264
I'm just getting started.
