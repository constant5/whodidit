00:00:03,881 --> 00:00:05,048
(siren wailing)

00:00:05,048 --> 00:00:07,618
So, which one
is your favorite?

00:00:07,618 --> 00:00:09,453
Got to go with
<i>Jailhouse Rock.</i>

00:00:09,453 --> 00:00:11,054
But <i>Blue Hawaii's</i>
right up there.

00:00:11,054 --> 00:00:12,990
Yeah.
How about you?

00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,926
Well, it's
a little obscure,

00:00:15,926 --> 00:00:18,362
but I'd have to say that
my favorite Elvis movie

00:00:18,362 --> 00:00:20,330
is definitely
<i>Change of Habit.</i>

00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:21,932
There's just something
about Mary Tyler Moore

00:00:21,932 --> 00:00:23,500
dressed as a nun.

00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,635
Yeah, I can see that.

00:00:24,635 --> 00:00:25,569
SIDLE:
Hey, guys.

00:00:27,438 --> 00:00:28,639
Wow.

00:00:28,639 --> 00:00:30,441
Viva Las Vegas.

00:00:30,441 --> 00:00:33,577
Yeah, minus the "viva."
No encore for this guy.

00:00:33,577 --> 00:00:34,611
Do we have a name?

00:00:34,611 --> 00:00:36,613
George Tabin.
Business card says

00:00:36,613 --> 00:00:38,515
he's an Elvis tribute artist.

00:00:38,515 --> 00:00:39,616
Cash is still there.

00:00:39,616 --> 00:00:41,018
Credit cards, too.

00:00:41,018 --> 00:00:42,019
Rules out robbery.

00:00:44,655 --> 00:00:46,657
Looks like multiple head wounds.

00:00:46,657 --> 00:00:48,959
No blood on the bench.

00:00:48,959 --> 00:00:51,395
No blood pool on the ground.

00:00:51,395 --> 00:00:53,564
No, this was definitely
not the primary.

00:00:53,564 --> 00:00:55,365
He was killed somewhere else,
brought here,

00:00:55,365 --> 00:00:56,567
propped up on the bench,

00:00:56,567 --> 00:00:58,535
and staged.

00:00:58,535 --> 00:00:59,937
I've got
gravitational blood drops

00:00:59,937 --> 00:01:02,439
over here heading
away from the body.

00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:06,043
Maybe from the weapon?

00:01:06,043 --> 00:01:07,311
Well, looks
like a trail.

00:01:07,311 --> 00:01:09,012
Nice night
for a stroll.

00:01:17,988 --> 00:01:21,592
End of the blood trail.

00:01:21,592 --> 00:01:23,293
No murder weapon,

00:01:23,293 --> 00:01:26,497
but looks like
we have another victim.

00:01:28,031 --> 00:01:29,600
It's been stabbed.

00:01:30,834 --> 00:01:33,604
There has to be a connection.

00:01:33,604 --> 00:01:36,006
Maybe the killer
is making a reference

00:01:36,006 --> 00:01:37,708
to Edgar Allan Poe.

00:01:37,708 --> 00:01:39,443
Well, then he needs
to brush up on his birds.

00:01:39,443 --> 00:01:40,844
This isn't a raven,
it's a rook.

00:01:40,844 --> 00:01:43,614
You see the white skin
around its beak?

00:01:45,516 --> 00:01:47,618
A rook?

00:01:47,618 --> 00:01:49,520
Well, the weird thing
though is rooks are

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,889
indigenous to Central
Europe and Asia.

00:01:51,889 --> 00:01:53,690
What's one doing
in Southern Nevada?

00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,759
I think I made the connection.

00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,462
Between a bird and an
Elvis impersonator?

00:01:58,462 --> 00:02:01,298
No, between a rook...

00:02:01,298 --> 00:02:03,033
and a king.

00:02:03,033 --> 00:02:05,402
As in, they're both
chess pieces.

00:02:05,402 --> 00:02:07,538
As in,
whoever our killer is

00:02:07,538 --> 00:02:09,907
has a sick sense of humor.

00:02:19,683 --> 00:02:22,753

00:02:49,613 --> 00:02:52,950
Lost or lost
in your thoughts?

00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:55,619
Avenue D and 1st.

00:02:55,619 --> 00:02:57,421
D1.

00:02:57,421 --> 00:03:00,891
We found the king
at Avenue C and 1st.

00:03:00,891 --> 00:03:02,392
<i>C1.</i>

00:03:02,392 --> 00:03:03,760
Now I'm lost.

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,563
We're looking for
the primary, right?

00:03:12,502 --> 00:03:14,771
Where are we going?

00:03:18,508 --> 00:03:22,346
Uh, you want
to fill me in, or...?

00:03:22,346 --> 00:03:24,715
The squares of a
chessboard are delineated

00:03:24,715 --> 00:03:26,416
by letters and numbers.

00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:29,453
Avenue E and
1st Street-- E1.

00:03:29,453 --> 00:03:32,956
Now, there is a chess move
known as "castling."

00:03:32,956 --> 00:03:35,525
<i>The player moves</i>
<i>two pieces at the same time.</i>

00:03:35,525 --> 00:03:38,428
<i>The rook from its</i>
<i>original position to D1,</i>

00:03:38,428 --> 00:03:42,399
<i>and the king from E1 to C1.</i>

00:03:42,399 --> 00:03:45,002
From Avenue E and 1st Street
to Avenue C and 1st Street.

00:03:45,002 --> 00:03:47,304
We are in the Alphabets.

00:03:47,304 --> 00:03:49,006
Um, Greg,
I-I know you were captain

00:03:49,006 --> 00:03:52,309
of your high school chess team,
and-and I respect your instincts

00:03:52,309 --> 00:03:54,511
as a criminalist immensely...
But you think I'm reaching.

00:03:56,046 --> 00:03:57,447
No.

00:03:57,447 --> 00:03:59,383
Actually, I-I think
you're a genius.

00:03:59,383 --> 00:04:00,917
Memphis or bust?

00:04:00,917 --> 00:04:03,320
Graceland's in Memphis, right?

00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,554
Yeah.

00:04:08,925 --> 00:04:11,428
(groans)

00:04:11,428 --> 00:04:12,996
There is a significant
amount of blood spatter

00:04:12,996 --> 00:04:14,998
in the driver's seat.

00:04:14,998 --> 00:04:16,667
I think we just found
our primary.

00:04:18,669 --> 00:04:21,038
Maybe he wanted us to find
the king's carriage as well.

00:04:21,038 --> 00:04:24,808
Even threw in the murder weapon.

00:04:26,843 --> 00:04:29,312
So, Doc, word
on the street is...

00:04:29,312 --> 00:04:30,447
If you say,

00:04:30,447 --> 00:04:31,615
"The king is dead,"

00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:33,450
I will kick you
right out of here.

00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:36,920
I've already had my fill of
bad Elvis puns from David.

00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,422
So hard to resist.

00:04:38,422 --> 00:04:39,856
Yes, I'm sure.

00:04:39,856 --> 00:04:42,492
Okay, C.O.D. is multiple

00:04:42,492 --> 00:04:44,027
craniocerebral injuries

00:04:44,027 --> 00:04:46,430
due to the blunt force
trauma to the head.

00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:48,331
Consistent with
the tire iron we found.

00:04:48,331 --> 00:04:49,800
Didn't have any prints on it.

00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,769
Well, he was struck at
least a dozen times.

00:04:52,769 --> 00:04:55,038
Suggests rage.
With a twist.

00:04:55,038 --> 00:04:58,942
The tox screen flagged
diphenhydramine in his system.

00:04:58,942 --> 00:05:00,510
Wow, at these levels,

00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,813
even the real Elvis
would've been unconscious.

00:05:02,813 --> 00:05:04,948
Yes. There, uh...

00:05:04,948 --> 00:05:07,584
was no pill residue in
his gastric contents,

00:05:07,584 --> 00:05:10,053
but I found this.

00:05:10,053 --> 00:05:12,489
An injection site.

00:05:12,489 --> 00:05:14,991
So, he was drugged
<i>before</i> he was beaten to death.

00:05:14,991 --> 00:05:17,661
Premeditation,
careful planning.

00:05:17,661 --> 00:05:18,929
Just like a chess player.

00:05:18,929 --> 00:05:21,064
Well, that's very
astute of you.

00:05:21,064 --> 00:05:22,532
(imitating Elvis):
Thank you very much.

00:05:22,532 --> 00:05:24,468
Out. Get out.

00:05:27,804 --> 00:05:29,639
I know you're a fan
of fungi,

00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:31,808
but are you also a fan
of nonvascular plants?

00:05:31,808 --> 00:05:33,643
Specifically bryophyta?

00:05:33,643 --> 00:05:34,845
Should I be?

00:05:34,845 --> 00:05:36,780
Well, if it helps us
catch a killer, yes.

00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,348
<i>I found</i>
<i>what I thought was a hair</i>

00:05:38,348 --> 00:05:40,650
<i>on the king's jumpsuit.</i>

00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:42,519
<i>Didn't match our vic,</i>
<i>so I ran it.</i>

00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:44,421
And you found out
that it was moss.

00:05:44,421 --> 00:05:45,422
Yes.

00:05:45,422 --> 00:05:46,456
In this case,

00:05:46,456 --> 00:05:48,391
a small, but mighty variety

00:05:48,391 --> 00:05:51,661
capable of consuming 20%
of its own weight in fluids.

00:05:51,661 --> 00:05:53,697
Sounds like my college roommate.

00:05:53,697 --> 00:05:55,065
(laughs)
I know that guy.

00:05:55,065 --> 00:05:56,900
It's a little
strange, isn't it?

00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,435
I mean, you can't grow moss
in Vegas; it's a desert.

00:05:58,435 --> 00:05:59,770
You need moisture.

00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:01,872
I found traces
of sodium lauryl sulfate

00:06:01,872 --> 00:06:04,007
and shea butter on the stem.

00:06:04,007 --> 00:06:06,576
Those are commonly found
in shampoos and bath oils.

00:06:06,576 --> 00:06:07,711
I give up.

00:06:07,711 --> 00:06:09,780
Where's this moss from?

00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,382
Not to shill
for the Mediterranean Hotel,

00:06:12,382 --> 00:06:14,684
<i>but they recently installed</i>
<i>live-moss bath mats</i>

00:06:14,684 --> 00:06:16,286
<i>in all of their rooms.</i>

00:06:16,286 --> 00:06:19,055
Part of an
"environmental chic" design.

00:06:19,055 --> 00:06:21,458
Now, I checked.
Our Elvis impersonator is

00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:23,426
persona non grata
at the Mediterranean,

00:06:23,426 --> 00:06:25,295
but perhaps our killer isn't.

00:06:25,295 --> 00:06:27,631
Bit of a long shot,
don't you think?

00:06:27,631 --> 00:06:29,599
Not if I told you
that the Mediterranean

00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:32,536
is currently hosting an
international chess tournament.

00:06:32,536 --> 00:06:33,670
Ah.

00:06:37,974 --> 00:06:40,510
WOMAN (over P.A.): Welcome to
the King's Crown Tournament.

00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:43,647
All players, please show
your USCM I.D. cards

00:06:43,647 --> 00:06:44,848
at the registration desk.

00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:48,418
Hi.

00:06:48,418 --> 00:06:49,619
MAN: Check.
MAN 2: Damn it.

00:06:53,456 --> 00:06:54,691
(laughs)

00:06:54,691 --> 00:06:56,026
Come on, man.

00:06:56,026 --> 00:06:57,828
You really think
that one of these guys

00:06:57,828 --> 00:06:59,462
took a tire iron
to the king?

00:06:59,462 --> 00:07:00,997
SANDERS:
What?

00:07:00,997 --> 00:07:02,566
Too nerdy to kill?

00:07:02,566 --> 00:07:04,668
Well, yeah. I mean,
look at them.

00:07:04,668 --> 00:07:07,704
I doubt if half of these guys
could even hold a tire iron

00:07:07,704 --> 00:07:09,739
over their head,
much less swing it.

00:07:09,739 --> 00:07:12,609
Chess is by definition

00:07:12,609 --> 00:07:16,479
a sequence of captures,
ambushes, sacrifices

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,647
and attacks.

00:07:17,647 --> 00:07:20,016
It's violence played out.

00:07:20,016 --> 00:07:22,819
Uh, no, I think it's
just a board game.

00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:24,354
LVPD?

00:07:24,354 --> 00:07:25,722
Yes.

00:07:25,722 --> 00:07:27,557
I'm Jenny Carroll, the
tournament director.

00:07:27,557 --> 00:07:29,492
I believe I spoke with
one of you on the phone.

00:07:29,492 --> 00:07:31,528
That would be me.
I'm CSI Sanders.
Hi.

00:07:31,528 --> 00:07:32,896
CSI Stokes.
Thank you for your time.

00:07:32,896 --> 00:07:34,764
We just want to ask you
a few questions, okay?

00:07:34,764 --> 00:07:36,533
What about?

00:07:36,533 --> 00:07:38,969
Well, actually,
it's about a homicide.

00:07:38,969 --> 00:07:41,404
A homicide connected
to the festival?

00:07:41,404 --> 00:07:42,873
You mentioned
on the phone

00:07:42,873 --> 00:07:46,042
that this tournament is
part of a promotional tour?

00:07:46,042 --> 00:07:49,512
Yes, we are trying to broaden
the appeal of the game.

00:07:49,512 --> 00:07:50,780
Just make it sexier.

00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,515
Oh, well, no offense.

00:07:52,515 --> 00:07:54,451
You might want to try getting
a few more women in the joint.

00:07:54,451 --> 00:07:55,986
(laughs)
Oh, I agree.

00:07:55,986 --> 00:07:57,787
Chess has been
pretty much a man's game.

00:07:57,787 --> 00:07:59,823
It would be nice to open it up.

00:07:59,823 --> 00:08:01,524
Can't say I disagree
with that.

00:08:02,926 --> 00:08:05,929
Uh, excuse me.

00:08:05,929 --> 00:08:07,631
STOKES:
He, uh...

00:08:07,631 --> 00:08:09,799
he played chess in high school;
he-he gets really excited.

00:08:09,799 --> 00:08:11,868
Check.

00:08:19,342 --> 00:08:20,944
Kid?

00:08:20,944 --> 00:08:22,712
I should've known
that you would've been here.

00:08:22,712 --> 00:08:23,647
Hey, do you mind?

00:08:24,748 --> 00:08:26,283
Man's an old friend.

00:08:26,283 --> 00:08:27,450
A player once, too.

00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:28,685
Well, if that's the case,

00:08:28,685 --> 00:08:29,920
then you should know enough

00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,354
to show some respect
for the game.

00:08:31,354 --> 00:08:33,556
People should show
respect period.

00:08:37,661 --> 00:08:40,397
We're done.

00:08:40,397 --> 00:08:42,899
He's, uh... intense.

00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:45,902
From the looks of it,
he had already lost anyways.

00:08:45,902 --> 00:08:48,638
I assume you're not here
for the tournament.

00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,975
I'm sorry, I still
can't believe

00:08:51,975 --> 00:08:54,477
anyone here would be
involved in murder.

00:08:54,477 --> 00:08:57,614
Well, I've seen
stranger things.

00:08:57,614 --> 00:09:00,917
So, how long is
the tournament in town?

00:09:00,917 --> 00:09:04,287
Since Monday. We're on the
eighth stop of a 12-city tour.

00:09:04,287 --> 00:09:06,289
STOKES: And how many
players do you have?

00:09:06,289 --> 00:09:08,325
150 signed up in Vegas.

00:09:08,325 --> 00:09:09,592
Well, if you don't mind,

00:09:09,592 --> 00:09:11,594
I'm gonna need
a list of all their names.

00:09:11,594 --> 00:09:14,564
Including a list
of all your vendors.

00:09:14,564 --> 00:09:15,999
Quite frankly,
anything associated

00:09:15,999 --> 00:09:17,767
with the chess tour, okay?

00:09:17,767 --> 00:09:19,469
Okay, sure.

00:09:19,469 --> 00:09:21,504
I-I still think you're looking
in the wrong place,

00:09:21,504 --> 00:09:22,605
but whatever you need.

00:09:22,605 --> 00:09:24,407
Who is this guy?

00:09:24,407 --> 00:09:25,508
What's going on over here?

00:09:25,508 --> 00:09:27,410
It's called a "simul."

00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:30,280
Um, man in the middle is
former champion Karl Schrute.

00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,881
He's playing against
everyone seated.

00:09:31,881 --> 00:09:33,516
He's playing
everybody at once?

00:09:33,516 --> 00:09:34,684
Yeah, he's our
star attraction.

00:09:34,684 --> 00:09:36,419
Ah, that's
a pretty cool trick.

00:09:36,419 --> 00:09:39,022
Amateurs come from all over
to play against him.

00:09:39,022 --> 00:09:40,523
So, former champ.

00:09:40,523 --> 00:09:41,992
Has anyone ever
beat him doing that?

00:09:41,992 --> 00:09:43,626
Never.

00:09:43,626 --> 00:09:45,395
What about you?

00:09:45,395 --> 00:09:47,297
Looks like you could
beat him pretty easy.

00:09:47,297 --> 00:09:49,399
Okay, I'll start working
on that list.
(laughs)

00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:51,334
Okay.

00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,843
MAN:
<i>"Chess Freak Kills the King."</i>

00:09:59,843 --> 00:10:02,312
Would certainly make
for a great headline.

00:10:02,312 --> 00:10:04,647
Maybe I <i>can</i> see it.

00:10:04,647 --> 00:10:06,683
At first, the game
gets in your blood.

00:10:06,683 --> 00:10:08,351
Then it gets in your head.

00:10:09,719 --> 00:10:11,588
It can drive you to madness.

00:10:13,723 --> 00:10:16,026
Any idea who you're looking for?

00:10:16,026 --> 00:10:18,495
I've already told you
everything I can tell you, Max.

00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,929
Heard that before.

00:10:19,929 --> 00:10:23,900
Day you told me you were
turning your back on the game.

00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,468
(sighs)

00:10:25,468 --> 00:10:27,837
It's good to see you again, Max.

00:10:27,837 --> 00:10:30,407
Good to be seen.

00:10:30,407 --> 00:10:32,375
(timer ticking)

00:10:37,013 --> 00:10:39,015
SIDLE: Nick got a list
of all the participants

00:10:39,015 --> 00:10:41,518
and the vendors
at the King's Crown.

00:10:41,518 --> 00:10:43,853
There are a lot of names
to go through.

00:10:43,853 --> 00:10:45,889
Let's pull people
from day shift and swing.

00:10:45,889 --> 00:10:47,390
More eyes, the better.

00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:49,059
You know,
if you want to play by yourself,

00:10:49,059 --> 00:10:50,693
there's, uh, computers for that.

00:10:50,693 --> 00:10:52,595
Yeah. Actually, do me a favor.
Come here.

00:10:52,595 --> 00:10:54,631
Sit down for a sec.

00:10:57,333 --> 00:11:00,470
Take a look at the white pieces.
Tell me what you see.

00:11:01,938 --> 00:11:03,540
Looks like you castled
your king.

00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,375
On the queen's side,
just like the killer.

00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:07,077
But what else?

00:11:08,878 --> 00:11:12,282
SIDLE: <i>You moved your pawns,</i>
<i>your knight,</i>

00:11:12,282 --> 00:11:13,883
<i>the bishop and the queen.</i>

00:11:13,883 --> 00:11:17,654
If you want to castle,
you have to move those pieces.

00:11:17,654 --> 00:11:20,790
Because castling
can't be an opening move.

00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:23,860
Which means if the killer
is following the rules,

00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,696
our Elvis impersonator
would not be his first kill.

00:11:26,696 --> 00:11:29,466
And if that's true, then our job
just got a lot harder.

00:11:29,466 --> 00:11:32,335
We're not just looking
for a suspect,

00:11:32,335 --> 00:11:34,070
we're looking
for more victims.

00:11:35,405 --> 00:11:37,073
Hey.
Hey.

00:11:37,073 --> 00:11:38,741
Oh, sorry.

00:11:38,741 --> 00:11:40,543
It's okay, I'm on hold.
I've been looking at

00:11:40,543 --> 00:11:42,278
all of our open cases
for the past year.

00:11:42,278 --> 00:11:44,447
None of them seem to have
anything to do with chess.

00:11:44,447 --> 00:11:45,982
What about outside Vegas?

00:11:45,982 --> 00:11:47,784
You're thinking that
if our killer is connected

00:11:47,784 --> 00:11:49,018
to the King's Crown Tour,

00:11:49,018 --> 00:11:51,421
maybe our cases
that we're looking for

00:11:51,421 --> 00:11:53,323
are in cities where
the tour has stopped.

00:11:53,323 --> 00:11:55,725
Yeah. I'm on hold with
San Francisco PD right now.

00:11:55,725 --> 00:11:57,627
Yeah. Oh, Detective Ettinger.

00:11:57,627 --> 00:12:00,697
Yeah, I'm looking
for unsolved murders

00:12:00,697 --> 00:12:02,665
the week of
February 17th.

00:12:02,665 --> 00:12:06,469
Right, bodies found near
numbered streets or avenues.

00:12:06,469 --> 00:12:08,438
Uh, there is
one other parameter.

00:12:08,438 --> 00:12:10,673
It's gonna sound a little crazy,
but the crimes are gonna have

00:12:10,673 --> 00:12:13,443
some sort of
association with chess.

00:12:13,443 --> 00:12:16,546
Yeah, like, the victim
could be a bishop or a priest

00:12:16,546 --> 00:12:18,948
or maybe some
kind of queen.

00:12:20,683 --> 00:12:22,519
I know it sounds crazy.
Look, any help

00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:25,388
that-that you could give
would be greatly appreciated.

00:12:25,388 --> 00:12:26,389
Thank you.

00:12:26,389 --> 00:12:27,524
(laughs)

00:12:27,524 --> 00:12:29,025
I do not envy you.

00:12:29,025 --> 00:12:30,527
Well, misery
loves company.

00:12:30,527 --> 00:12:31,794
Mm.

00:12:31,794 --> 00:12:33,630
We... have six more
cities to call.

00:12:38,968 --> 00:12:41,304
SIDLE:
Russell, you were right.

00:12:41,304 --> 00:12:44,474
Our Elvis impersonator was not
the killer's first victim.

00:12:44,474 --> 00:12:46,309
Morgan and I found
six other murders

00:12:46,309 --> 00:12:48,578
that look to be chess-related--
not in Vegas,

00:12:48,578 --> 00:12:50,914
but in the last three cities
that the chess tour visited.

00:12:50,914 --> 00:12:52,749
Portland, San Francisco
and Reno.

00:12:52,749 --> 00:12:54,817
SIDLE: <i>In Portland,</i>
<i>a woman on horseback</i>

00:12:54,817 --> 00:12:55,919
<i>and a homeless man.</i>

00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:57,687
RUSSELL:
<i>Knight and a pawn.</i>

00:12:57,687 --> 00:12:59,489
SIDLE: <i>In San Francisco,</i>
<i>a drag queen and a priest.</i>

00:12:59,489 --> 00:13:01,324
SANDERS:
<i>A queen and a bishop.</i>

00:13:01,324 --> 00:13:04,360
<i>And in Reno, another</i>
<i>homeless person and a priest.</i>

00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,563
RUSSELL:
<i>Another pawn and a bishop.</i>

00:13:06,563 --> 00:13:08,898
All the bodies were dumped
at intersections

00:13:08,898 --> 00:13:10,500
of numbered
and lettered streets.

00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,302
So we have seven victims.

00:13:12,302 --> 00:13:13,603
Seven chess murders.

00:13:13,603 --> 00:13:15,371
Mm-hmm.

00:13:15,371 --> 00:13:17,874
But I don't believe that
the murders are capture-kills.

00:13:17,874 --> 00:13:19,876
The killer is not
eliminating pieces.

00:13:19,876 --> 00:13:22,579
I believe that these murders
are chess moves.

00:13:22,579 --> 00:13:25,281
SANDERS: Like our dead Elvis--
king to C1.

00:13:25,281 --> 00:13:27,584
He wasn't eliminating
the king...

00:13:27,584 --> 00:13:29,319
just moving him.

00:13:29,319 --> 00:13:32,021
So we have a serial killer
who's playing a game,

00:13:32,021 --> 00:13:35,658
and every time he makes a move,
somebody dies.

00:13:35,658 --> 00:13:38,828
Yeah. Well, based on
what I can see,

00:13:38,828 --> 00:13:40,697
the game's
just beginning.

00:13:52,008 --> 00:13:54,477
I knew you'd be back.

00:13:54,477 --> 00:13:56,512
Same old Max.

00:13:56,512 --> 00:13:57,914
How many games
have you played

00:13:57,914 --> 00:13:59,315
just staring at
that board?

00:14:01,284 --> 00:14:03,820
Why don't you sit down...
find out?

00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:04,988
I told you.

00:14:04,988 --> 00:14:06,456
I don't play anymore.

00:14:06,456 --> 00:14:08,558
You play every day.

00:14:08,558 --> 00:14:11,394
You just don't do it
on a chessboard.

00:14:13,997 --> 00:14:17,333
The only game I'm
playing right now

00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:19,302
is "catch a killer."

00:14:19,302 --> 00:14:21,604
And I need your help.

00:14:21,604 --> 00:14:24,741
This is a list
of chess moves.

00:14:24,741 --> 00:14:28,745
I need to know what
move comes next.

00:14:28,745 --> 00:14:30,713
You already know it.

00:14:30,713 --> 00:14:34,550
In here.

00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,486
I really don't.

00:14:36,486 --> 00:14:38,421
I only have one
side of the board,

00:14:38,421 --> 00:14:40,456
and I don't know any of
the opponent's moves.

00:14:40,456 --> 00:14:43,026
Remember what I told you
all those years ago?

00:14:43,026 --> 00:14:46,396
Don't play the board,

00:14:46,396 --> 00:14:47,864
play the man.

00:14:47,864 --> 00:14:52,835
Greg, the board is the
face of your opponent.

00:14:52,835 --> 00:14:56,506
You can know a man just
by watching him play.

00:14:56,506 --> 00:15:00,410
I knew you the minute you put
your money down to play me.

00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:02,512
You don't know me.

00:15:02,512 --> 00:15:05,815
You come here every
day after school.

00:15:05,815 --> 00:15:07,717
You're not at
football practice,

00:15:07,717 --> 00:15:10,019
you're not in the
parking lot getting high.

00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:12,021
You're different
from the other kids.

00:15:12,021 --> 00:15:15,291
You think differently,
feel differently.

00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:16,426
You want different.

00:15:16,426 --> 00:15:18,027
What do I want?

00:15:18,027 --> 00:15:20,763
You want to be the best!

00:15:20,763 --> 00:15:24,801
But to be the best,
you've got to go through me.

00:15:26,903 --> 00:15:28,071
School's in.

00:15:28,071 --> 00:15:29,706
SANDERS:
<i>Come on, Max.</i>

00:15:29,706 --> 00:15:31,374
We're not back
in the park.

00:15:31,374 --> 00:15:33,676
This isn't
a lesson here.

00:15:33,676 --> 00:15:35,411
There are people's
lives at stake.

00:15:42,385 --> 00:15:45,054
This game has already
been played.

00:15:45,054 --> 00:15:46,689
16 years ago.

00:15:46,689 --> 00:15:49,025
These are the opening moves
in the championship match

00:15:49,025 --> 00:15:51,894
between Karl Schrute
and Troy Parker.

00:15:53,796 --> 00:15:56,933
Karl Schrute-- that's the guy
doing the dog and pony show,

00:15:56,933 --> 00:15:58,668
playing simuls in
this tournament here.

00:15:58,668 --> 00:16:00,636
Man's got to make a living.

00:16:02,605 --> 00:16:06,442
All right, what about, uh,
his opponent, Parker?

00:16:06,442 --> 00:16:07,810
(chuckles)

00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:09,846
Troy Parker was
the greatest American player

00:16:09,846 --> 00:16:11,848
since Bobby Fischer.

00:16:11,848 --> 00:16:14,951
Till he lost
that championship in '98.

00:16:14,951 --> 00:16:17,687
After that,
he went off the rails.

00:16:17,687 --> 00:16:20,656
Just disappeared.

00:16:20,656 --> 00:16:24,494
Back in '98...

00:16:24,494 --> 00:16:26,429
what was Parker's
next move?

00:16:26,429 --> 00:16:28,598
Bishop to E3.

00:16:30,967 --> 00:16:32,869
Mm, yes.

00:16:32,869 --> 00:16:35,772
It was Parker's fatal move,
actually.

00:16:35,772 --> 00:16:37,707
A mental mistake.

00:16:37,707 --> 00:16:40,843
Uncharacteristic for
someone so gifted.

00:16:40,843 --> 00:16:43,813
And it was that move
that gave you the game?

00:16:43,813 --> 00:16:45,848
Yes, yes.

00:16:45,848 --> 00:16:48,618
He had me on the
ropes until then.

00:16:48,618 --> 00:16:51,287
Only a few moves
away from victory.

00:16:54,857 --> 00:16:56,926
And it wasn't just
the end of the game. No.

00:16:56,926 --> 00:16:58,961
It was the end of him.

00:16:58,961 --> 00:17:01,998
The man became a ghost.

00:17:01,998 --> 00:17:06,002
Do you think he might harbor
any resentment toward you

00:17:06,002 --> 00:17:09,839
about the game
or even try to...

00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,308
engineer some kind
of a rematch?

00:17:12,308 --> 00:17:15,445
Troy Parker was not
a violent man.

00:17:15,445 --> 00:17:16,446
Okay.

00:17:18,548 --> 00:17:21,517
So can you think of
anyone else out there

00:17:21,517 --> 00:17:24,754
who might have
an unhealthy interest

00:17:24,754 --> 00:17:26,289
in your old match
with Parker?

00:17:26,289 --> 00:17:27,990
I can think of
hundreds of people

00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:31,394
that cannot stop talking
about that match.

00:17:32,862 --> 00:17:35,298
And as far as
"unhealthy interest,"

00:17:35,298 --> 00:17:39,569
I get a letter a week
from some crackpot.

00:17:39,569 --> 00:17:40,870
Really?

00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:42,638
Have you, uh, received
any recently?

00:17:45,808 --> 00:17:48,444
You know, I did
receive an odd missive

00:17:48,444 --> 00:17:49,679
when I first arrived
at the hotel.

00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:50,847
I didn't think
twice about it.

00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:52,715
What kind of missive?

00:17:52,715 --> 00:17:56,586
It was a note wishing me well,
wrapped around a chess piece.

00:17:56,586 --> 00:17:59,922
Um, it was sort of,
mm... handmade.

00:18:03,459 --> 00:18:05,328
It was a bishop.

00:18:05,328 --> 00:18:06,996
Do you still have it?
I believe so.

00:18:06,996 --> 00:18:10,366
Unless they've
emptied the trash.

00:18:11,434 --> 00:18:14,871
♪ ♪

00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:43,299
♪ ♪

00:18:53,809 --> 00:18:57,446
I processed the hand-carved
bishop sent to Karl Schrute.

00:18:57,446 --> 00:19:00,583
It wasn't hand-carved so much
as it was hand-sculpted.

00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:02,785
Made from papier-mâché.

00:19:02,785 --> 00:19:06,055
A curious stew of toilet
paper, laundry soap and water.

00:19:06,055 --> 00:19:08,057
Okay. That sounds improvised.

00:19:08,057 --> 00:19:10,693
By someone with a lot of time
on his hands.

00:19:10,693 --> 00:19:12,495
Say, a prison inmate?

00:19:12,495 --> 00:19:14,063
The laundry soap
in our bishop

00:19:14,063 --> 00:19:17,667
is specifically formulated
to work with the hard water

00:19:17,667 --> 00:19:18,901
at Ely State Prison.

00:19:18,901 --> 00:19:20,636
Good work.

00:19:20,636 --> 00:19:22,004
All right, so we need

00:19:22,004 --> 00:19:24,407
to cross-reference the list
of people who attended

00:19:24,407 --> 00:19:26,943
the chess tour with
the population at Ely, right?

00:19:26,943 --> 00:19:28,611
Already done.

00:19:28,611 --> 00:19:31,981
I have a face
and a name.

00:19:31,981 --> 00:19:33,616
You are on fire.

00:19:33,616 --> 00:19:35,685
"Lee Crosby."

00:19:42,425 --> 00:19:45,962
So you're just
gonna sit there?

00:19:45,962 --> 00:19:47,830
Not gonna ask
why you're here?

00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,799
You'll tell me
when you want to.

00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:51,300
Or maybe
you already know.

00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,002
That's a photo

00:19:53,002 --> 00:19:54,937
from the dash-cam
of a Number 7 Bus.

00:19:54,937 --> 00:19:56,672
It shows you
two nights ago

00:19:56,672 --> 00:19:58,674
on the corner
of Avenue C and 5th.

00:19:58,674 --> 00:20:01,978
Four blocks away from here.

00:20:03,312 --> 00:20:05,047
A bold opening.

00:20:05,047 --> 00:20:06,882
It's aggressive.

00:20:06,882 --> 00:20:08,784
I usually find
when an opponent leads

00:20:08,784 --> 00:20:11,787
with a big move, they don't have
much of a game to back it up.

00:20:11,787 --> 00:20:13,756
We're not playing
chess here, Mr. Crosby.

00:20:13,756 --> 00:20:15,057
And the fact
of the matter is,

00:20:15,057 --> 00:20:16,826
we have plenty.

00:20:16,826 --> 00:20:19,762
I guess this is the part
where I call my lawyer.

00:20:19,762 --> 00:20:21,664
Five bills an hour--

00:20:21,664 --> 00:20:24,300
I say save the money,
indulge the cop.

00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,335
STOKES: We know you
spent five years

00:20:26,335 --> 00:20:27,803
at Ely for possession,

00:20:27,803 --> 00:20:31,574
and that most of that time
was spent in a rehab program

00:20:31,574 --> 00:20:34,443
that taught you
how to play chess.

00:20:34,443 --> 00:20:36,712
Some inmates find God.
I found the Royal Game.

00:20:36,712 --> 00:20:38,280
CRAWFORD: You know
what we keep finding?

00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,615
You.

00:20:39,615 --> 00:20:42,551
In Portland,
San Francisco, Reno.

00:20:42,551 --> 00:20:44,487
All stops
on the chess tour.

00:20:44,487 --> 00:20:46,055
Cities where bodies
have been dropping.

00:20:46,055 --> 00:20:48,958
Like little chess moves
on a board.

00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:52,495
Admittedly, I am
a bit insane...

00:20:52,495 --> 00:20:54,930
about... chess.

00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:56,365
(chuckles)

00:20:56,365 --> 00:20:58,401
Yes, I have been
following the tour,

00:20:58,401 --> 00:20:59,802
but, like, riding
buses at night.

00:20:59,802 --> 00:21:01,303
That's all
I've been doing.

00:21:03,439 --> 00:21:06,308
You know who
Troy Parker is, right?

00:21:06,308 --> 00:21:08,010
Heard of him.

00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:10,846
At Ely, you ordered
over a dozen books on him.

00:21:10,846 --> 00:21:12,848
Including his book
on the game.

00:21:12,848 --> 00:21:14,450
CRAWFORD: Sounds like
an obsession to me.

00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:17,286
I bet you know every move
this guy's ever made.

00:21:17,286 --> 00:21:19,989
I bet you even think
that you're better than him.

00:21:19,989 --> 00:21:22,491
Parker was the best,
the top of his game,

00:21:22,491 --> 00:21:25,294
but he made a mistake,
a single bad move,

00:21:25,294 --> 00:21:26,595
and it was his undoing.

00:21:26,595 --> 00:21:28,330
Won't catch me making
that same error.

00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:29,965
Promise you that.

00:21:29,965 --> 00:21:31,834
You've been following
the chess tour.

00:21:31,834 --> 00:21:34,470
You've been dogging Schrute,
trying to get him

00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:36,338
to play you one-on-one.

00:21:36,338 --> 00:21:38,374
There's a lot of people that
want to play Schrute, okay?

00:21:38,374 --> 00:21:39,842
STOKES:
Everyone is not obsessed

00:21:39,842 --> 00:21:41,911
with his old adversary,
Troy Parker,

00:21:41,911 --> 00:21:43,045
the way that you are.

00:21:43,045 --> 00:21:44,847
So obsessed...

00:21:44,847 --> 00:21:47,483
that you're replaying
their match from '98.

00:21:47,483 --> 00:21:48,851
And you've taken it

00:21:48,851 --> 00:21:51,420
to a whole nother level,
Mr. Crosby.

00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:52,955
You're killing people.

00:21:52,955 --> 00:21:57,827
In some sick,
twisted little fantasy.

00:21:57,827 --> 00:21:59,762
You're right.

00:22:02,064 --> 00:22:05,634
I would love to play Schrute.

00:22:05,634 --> 00:22:08,738
God, I would love to replay
his famous match with Parker.

00:22:08,738 --> 00:22:12,475
And you can forget about
"as good as Parker,"

00:22:12,475 --> 00:22:13,709
because I am better.

00:22:13,709 --> 00:22:15,511
I got something
that he never had.

00:22:15,511 --> 00:22:16,846
CRAWFORD:
What's that?
Killer instinct.
Mm-hmm.

00:22:18,481 --> 00:22:20,549
And this is just
between you and me.

00:22:22,485 --> 00:22:24,420
I'm no killer.

00:22:28,357 --> 00:22:29,458
What do you think?

00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:30,693
Is he our guy?

00:22:30,693 --> 00:22:32,628
Well, he's got
the arrogance.

00:22:32,628 --> 00:22:34,897
Delusions of grandeur.

00:22:34,897 --> 00:22:37,433
Greg said he's got
quite a temper, too.

00:22:37,433 --> 00:22:39,502
All right, let's have
Crawford sit on him

00:22:39,502 --> 00:22:41,570
while we get a warrant,
check out his place.

00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:42,905
(phone ringing)
Yeah.

00:22:42,905 --> 00:22:44,073
We're definitely gonna
need something more

00:22:44,073 --> 00:22:46,375
to connect him to
one of the victims.

00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:48,744
What is it?

00:22:48,744 --> 00:22:50,479
(sighs)

00:22:50,479 --> 00:22:52,848
Another move
has been played.

00:22:56,552 --> 00:22:58,354
SANDERS:
Hey, Sara.

00:22:58,354 --> 00:22:59,622
So what's going on?

00:22:59,622 --> 00:23:00,956
I think we have
another chess killer victim.

00:23:00,956 --> 00:23:03,359
The next body dump
was supposed to be

00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:04,627
near Avenue E and 3rd.

00:23:04,627 --> 00:23:05,628
Yeah, I know.

00:23:05,628 --> 00:23:07,630
But, uh... you need to see this.

00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:10,432
Victim's name
is Chris Shatlock.

00:23:10,432 --> 00:23:12,668
I found his wallet
tossed on the floor.

00:23:12,668 --> 00:23:16,639
Work card says that he does
a dinner show at the Four Kings.

00:23:16,639 --> 00:23:18,507
Take a look.

00:23:18,507 --> 00:23:20,743
Security guard
discovered him.

00:23:20,743 --> 00:23:22,812
Run through from
back to front.

00:23:22,812 --> 00:23:25,314
Found his uniform in the back.

00:23:25,314 --> 00:23:26,816
Take a look.

00:23:30,753 --> 00:23:32,621
He's a Knight of
the Round Table.

00:23:32,621 --> 00:23:33,923
SANDERS:
A knight?

00:23:35,491 --> 00:23:37,893
But next victim
should've been a bishop.

00:23:37,893 --> 00:23:39,762
Bishop to E3.

00:23:39,762 --> 00:23:41,063
That's what Schrute said;
it was Parker's next move.

00:23:41,063 --> 00:23:43,432
Yes. But...

00:23:43,432 --> 00:23:46,402
he has an injection mark

00:23:46,402 --> 00:23:49,305
on his neck,
just like our dead Elvis.

00:23:49,305 --> 00:23:51,674
And take a look at the wall.

00:23:52,775 --> 00:23:53,909
Knight to A4--

00:23:53,909 --> 00:23:55,511
that's a chess move.

00:23:55,511 --> 00:23:57,413
Killer's changed
his pattern.

00:23:58,814 --> 00:24:00,916
He's changed the game.

RUSSELL: Troy Parker--
I thought he was a ghost.

00:25:29,905 --> 00:25:31,707
Are you sure about this print?
Yep.

00:25:31,707 --> 00:25:33,042
Which means
we are holding

00:25:33,042 --> 00:25:34,576
the wrong guy for
these murders.

00:25:34,576 --> 00:25:36,812
At least the, uh, Knight
of the Round Table.

00:25:36,812 --> 00:25:39,381
T.O.D. says he was killed
at the same time

00:25:39,381 --> 00:25:41,817
we had Lee Crosby
in the box.

00:25:41,817 --> 00:25:43,052
So what are
we thinking?

00:25:43,052 --> 00:25:46,388
That Troy Parker
is staging his comeback?

00:25:46,388 --> 00:25:48,490
Replaying the game
he lost to Karl Schrute?

00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:50,492
Only to him,
it's not a game.

00:25:50,492 --> 00:25:52,561
He's making his moves
by killing people.

00:25:52,561 --> 00:25:55,831
Okay, so the guy's
a grandmaster.

00:25:55,831 --> 00:25:58,334
Right? He thinks he's
smarter than his opponent.

00:25:58,334 --> 00:26:00,369
Right now,
his opponent is us,

00:26:00,369 --> 00:26:02,304
so we need
to make the next move.

00:26:02,304 --> 00:26:03,872
What do we know about him?
Anything?

00:26:03,872 --> 00:26:05,774
Where is he?

00:26:05,774 --> 00:26:07,643
Well, since '98, he's been
pretty much of a recluse,

00:26:07,643 --> 00:26:10,446
and, uh, nobody has laid eyes
on him in the last five years.

00:26:10,446 --> 00:26:13,949
Nick did pull some trace
from the dead knight's car.

00:26:13,949 --> 00:26:16,285
Hopefully, Parker left
something behind.

00:26:16,285 --> 00:26:17,753
We need to find this guy.

00:26:17,753 --> 00:26:19,755
(knocking)

00:26:19,755 --> 00:26:21,991
I think
Troy Parker just reached out.

00:26:21,991 --> 00:26:23,993
CSI Russell,
Jenny Carroll.

00:26:23,993 --> 00:26:26,495
Ms. Carroll is in charge
of the chess tour.

00:26:26,495 --> 00:26:27,796
How do you do?

00:26:27,796 --> 00:26:29,665
How can I help you,
Ms. Carroll?

00:26:29,665 --> 00:26:31,934
We received this package at
our reception area an hour ago.

00:26:31,934 --> 00:26:34,737
It was sent to our grandmaster-
in-residence, Karl Schrute.

00:26:34,737 --> 00:26:36,872
Has anyone else touched this
besides you?

00:26:36,872 --> 00:26:39,441
My assistant and I.
He's the one who opened it.

00:26:46,615 --> 00:26:47,983
It's a knight.

00:26:47,983 --> 00:26:50,319
Has Mr. Schrute seen this yet?

00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:52,321
No, and truth is,
I can't find him.

00:26:52,321 --> 00:26:53,856
No one can.

00:26:53,856 --> 00:26:55,991
He's not in his room,
not answering his phone.

00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,728
You don't think something's
happened to him, do you?

00:26:59,728 --> 00:27:01,463
We're gonna need to keep this.

00:27:01,463 --> 00:27:04,933
Thank you so much
for-for bringing it to us.

00:27:04,933 --> 00:27:07,936
SANDERS:
<i>He's changed the game, Max.</i>

00:27:07,936 --> 00:27:09,338
Why?

00:27:09,338 --> 00:27:10,806
Why do you think?

00:27:10,806 --> 00:27:13,042
He wants to correct the error,

00:27:13,042 --> 00:27:15,477
the fatal mistake he made
the first time around,

00:27:15,477 --> 00:27:17,413
the one that cost him
the championship.

00:27:17,413 --> 00:27:19,314
Correct.

00:27:19,314 --> 00:27:23,886
Knight to A4 was the move Troy
Parker should have made in '98.

00:27:23,886 --> 00:27:26,422
So... the guy's
trying to win.

00:27:26,422 --> 00:27:28,057
No.

00:27:28,057 --> 00:27:30,292
He's going to win.

00:27:30,292 --> 00:27:32,628
But it's more than that.

00:27:32,628 --> 00:27:35,330
In '98, Troy Parker was
on the verge of doing something

00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:37,533
no one had ever done before
in competition.

00:27:37,533 --> 00:27:39,401
What are you talking about?

00:27:39,401 --> 00:27:41,437
The Osterlitz endgame.

00:27:41,437 --> 00:27:45,607
It's like...
the Holy Grail of chess.

00:27:45,607 --> 00:27:47,643
Parker was three moves

00:27:47,643 --> 00:27:50,679
away from making history
when he screwed up.

00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:53,449
Bishop to E3.

00:27:53,449 --> 00:27:56,685
The move that ruined his life.

00:27:58,554 --> 00:28:01,590
You think Parker's killing
these people, don't you?

00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:03,058
I didn't say that.

00:28:03,058 --> 00:28:04,660
Let me tell you something.

00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:08,730
Troy Parker was a genius.

00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:12,067
And... he was a fool.

00:28:12,067 --> 00:28:13,635
The man
you're looking for

00:28:13,635 --> 00:28:15,938
is neither.

00:28:15,938 --> 00:28:19,341
And it's definitely not...
Parker.

00:28:19,341 --> 00:28:21,410
How can you
be so sure?

00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:24,813
I mean, you're the
one who said it.

00:28:24,813 --> 00:28:28,550
Chess can drive
a man to madness.

00:28:31,019 --> 00:28:32,488
MAN:
You're Troy Parker?

00:28:32,488 --> 00:28:33,922
Is it really you?

00:28:33,922 --> 00:28:36,024
I often wonder that myself.
Do you mind?

00:28:36,024 --> 00:28:38,427
I can't believe this.
This is awesome.

00:28:38,427 --> 00:28:39,728
It really is you.

00:28:39,728 --> 00:28:41,997
PARKER: Congratulations.
You want a prize?

00:28:41,997 --> 00:28:44,833
MAN: Settle for an answer
to just one question.

00:28:44,833 --> 00:28:46,869
Bishop to E3, right?

00:28:46,869 --> 00:28:49,304
How could I have been so stupid?

00:28:49,304 --> 00:28:50,906
Dude, I didn't say that.

00:28:50,906 --> 00:28:54,476
No, but you thought it...
just like everyone thinks it.

00:28:54,476 --> 00:28:57,546
But aren't we all entitled to
make one mistake in our lives?

00:28:57,546 --> 00:28:58,947
Leave me alone.

00:28:58,947 --> 00:29:00,382
MAN:
Bro, bro, come back.

00:29:01,783 --> 00:29:05,020
All I wanted to ask was,
"Why did you quit?"

00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,989
Why did you quit?

00:29:06,989 --> 00:29:08,757
How long have you
been standing there?

00:29:08,757 --> 00:29:10,392
Not long.

00:29:10,392 --> 00:29:12,728
All these years, "captain
of the chess team."

00:29:12,728 --> 00:29:14,429
That's all you
ever told us.

00:29:14,429 --> 00:29:16,365
Didn't know you were
such a chess stud.

00:29:16,365 --> 00:29:19,501
Yeah, well, there are a lot of
things you don't know about me.

00:29:19,501 --> 00:29:21,570
(chuckles) You haven't
answered the question.

00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:23,372
I don't know why I quit.

00:29:23,372 --> 00:29:26,341
It's just, one day...

00:29:26,341 --> 00:29:28,310
I couldn't do it anymore.

00:29:30,412 --> 00:29:31,680
Like him.

00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,682
You know what the problem is

00:29:33,682 --> 00:29:37,619
with people like you,
with the world?

00:29:37,619 --> 00:29:41,623
You can't understand
what it is to be an artist.

00:29:41,623 --> 00:29:44,693
What it is to create beauty!

00:29:44,693 --> 00:29:47,496
You only understand <i>ugliness,</i>

00:29:47,496 --> 00:29:49,631
because you can only
understand yourself!

00:29:49,631 --> 00:29:51,466
MAN: Dude, I was just
trying to ask...

00:29:51,466 --> 00:29:52,868
Get that out of my face!

00:29:53,969 --> 00:29:55,971
Ooh.

00:29:55,971 --> 00:29:58,440
Man holds the
world in contempt.

00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,476
Just the kind of guy who might
see people as chess pieces.

00:30:04,846 --> 00:30:06,381
Hey, Nick.

00:30:06,381 --> 00:30:07,616
Yeah?
Apparently,

00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:09,351
there are no shortage
of people around

00:30:09,351 --> 00:30:11,019
who have seen your little
friend, cimexlectularius.

00:30:11,019 --> 00:30:12,654
Oh, yeah? Like who?
Got a list here

00:30:12,654 --> 00:30:14,022
of motels and weeklies,

00:30:14,022 --> 00:30:15,824
all with recent
infestations of bedbugs,

00:30:15,824 --> 00:30:17,659
just like the one you found
when you processed the car.

00:30:17,659 --> 00:30:19,528
Take a look at the
one in Boulder City.

00:30:19,528 --> 00:30:21,296
Manager there says
he's got a resident

00:30:21,296 --> 00:30:23,665
who matches the photo we
sent over of Troy Parker.

00:30:23,665 --> 00:30:25,400
Really?
Yeah. A little
older and grayer,

00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,535
but it's definitely him.

00:30:26,535 --> 00:30:28,303
Good. Thanks, Morgan.

00:30:30,572 --> 00:30:32,074
According to the manager,
Parker's been here

00:30:32,074 --> 00:30:34,309
for about a year
under the name Jason Winston.

00:30:34,309 --> 00:30:36,578
He always pays his rent
in advance, cash.

00:30:36,578 --> 00:30:38,480
Keeps to himself.

00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,882
Hmm. Sounds to me like a
guy who didn't want to draw

00:30:40,882 --> 00:30:42,284
any attention
to himself.

00:30:42,284 --> 00:30:43,452
Saving himself
for the big event?

00:30:43,452 --> 00:30:44,853
Yeah, well, game over.

00:30:46,388 --> 00:30:47,389
(knocking)

00:30:47,389 --> 00:30:49,625
Troy Parker, LVPD.

00:30:49,625 --> 00:30:50,559
Open up!

00:30:57,499 --> 00:30:58,734
LVPD!

00:31:00,602 --> 00:31:02,371
Parker!

00:31:20,589 --> 00:31:22,357
(water running)

00:31:37,973 --> 00:31:40,509
It's Lee Crosby.

00:31:40,509 --> 00:31:42,444
What?

00:31:43,945 --> 00:31:46,048
He's dead.

00:31:46,048 --> 00:31:47,382
(sighs)

00:31:47,382 --> 00:31:49,551
Damn it.

00:31:49,551 --> 00:31:50,819
Didn't have
enough to hold him.

00:31:50,819 --> 00:31:52,454
Had to let him go
this afternoon.

00:31:53,622 --> 00:31:54,823
STOKES:
Well, for somebody

00:31:54,823 --> 00:31:56,825
who studied
Parker's every move,

00:31:56,825 --> 00:31:59,661
I don't think he saw
that one coming.

00:32:06,702 --> 00:32:09,004
I found these vials
and-and syringes in the trash.

00:32:09,004 --> 00:32:11,006
Probably from the drug
that was used

00:32:11,006 --> 00:32:13,842
to paralyze the victims
before they were killed.

00:32:13,842 --> 00:32:15,711
I'll send it off to Hodges.

00:32:19,448 --> 00:32:21,550
Talk about
a dangerous mind, huh?

00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:23,652
All these chessboards.

00:32:23,652 --> 00:32:26,054
And it looks like they're
playing the exact same game.

00:32:26,054 --> 00:32:28,290
They are.

00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:29,591
Except this one.

00:32:29,591 --> 00:32:31,326
It's further along.

00:32:31,326 --> 00:32:32,294
My friend Max was right.

00:32:34,463 --> 00:32:36,598
It's the
Osterlitz endgame.

00:32:36,598 --> 00:32:38,300
And Parker's
playing it out.

00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:41,036
Crosby's murder--
it's just another move.

00:32:41,036 --> 00:32:43,605
And see the pawn
there tipped over?

00:32:43,605 --> 00:32:44,806
Parker's saying
that he and Crosby

00:32:44,806 --> 00:32:46,475
teamed up for the killings.

00:32:46,475 --> 00:32:48,510
But this whole time,
Crosby was just his pawn.

00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:52,347
And the move-- pawn to C6.

00:32:52,347 --> 00:32:54,783
<i>It's the part</i>
<i>of the Osterlitz endgame</i>

00:32:54,783 --> 00:32:56,985
<i>where the pawn</i>
<i>puts the king in check,</i>

00:32:56,985 --> 00:32:58,987
<i>only to be quickly sacrificed.</i>

00:32:58,987 --> 00:33:00,722
What does he do next?

00:33:00,722 --> 00:33:02,724
Checkmate.

00:33:02,724 --> 00:33:04,659
He takes down the king.

00:33:07,496 --> 00:33:09,030
Karl Schrute is missing.

00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,832
I think Parker has him.

00:33:10,832 --> 00:33:12,768
And he's gonna kill him.

00:33:12,768 --> 00:33:14,836
Not if we find him first.

00:33:14,836 --> 00:33:16,772
♪ ♪

00:33:40,395 --> 00:33:42,397
Morgan, you're not
gonna believe this.

00:33:42,397 --> 00:33:43,932
Try me.
The drugs in the vials

00:33:43,932 --> 00:33:45,901
recovered from Parker's place?

00:33:45,901 --> 00:33:48,437
It's not the diphenhydramine
Doc found in our victims.

00:33:48,437 --> 00:33:50,038
So what is it then?

00:33:50,038 --> 00:33:51,540
It's an experimental medication,

00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:52,908
available only
in Europe and Mexico.

00:33:52,908 --> 00:33:54,443
Used to treat people

00:33:54,443 --> 00:33:57,012
in the late stages
of vascular dementia.

00:33:57,012 --> 00:33:59,314
You realize what this
means, don't you?

00:33:59,314 --> 00:34:00,782
If the drugs are Parker's,
there's no way

00:34:00,782 --> 00:34:02,684
that he would be mentally
or physically capable

00:34:02,684 --> 00:34:03,885
of committing
any of those crimes.

00:34:03,885 --> 00:34:06,521
(computer beeping)

00:34:07,823 --> 00:34:10,425
Parker's not our guy.

00:34:10,425 --> 00:34:12,928
Then who is?

00:34:14,396 --> 00:34:16,665
Where's CSI Sanders?

00:34:16,665 --> 00:34:18,066
That's not your
problem, Mr. Lomax.

00:34:18,066 --> 00:34:19,768
Your problem is you've
been lying to us.

00:34:19,768 --> 00:34:23,472
STOKES: You knew this whole
time where Parker was.

00:34:23,472 --> 00:34:25,373
And you know he can
barely lift a fork,

00:34:25,373 --> 00:34:26,641
much less commit murder.

00:34:26,641 --> 00:34:27,909
RUSSELL: You should
know we're going

00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:30,011
through your
place right now.

00:34:30,011 --> 00:34:32,380
We're also going
through Lee Crosby's.

00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:34,583
Yeah, we know you two
hooked up at Ely.

00:34:34,583 --> 00:34:36,618
During that outreach program.

00:34:36,618 --> 00:34:39,521
We know that you're the one who
taught him how to play chess.

00:34:39,521 --> 00:34:40,789
RUSSELL: Is that where
you turned him on

00:34:40,789 --> 00:34:42,390
to this legendary match

00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:45,327
between Troy Parker
and Karl Schrute?

00:34:45,327 --> 00:34:47,362
We got your prints.

00:34:47,362 --> 00:34:49,064
We got you for conspiracy.

00:34:49,064 --> 00:34:51,299
So the only thing keeping you
from the needle

00:34:51,299 --> 00:34:53,001
is if you stop lying.

00:34:53,001 --> 00:34:54,903
And you tell us where Parker

00:34:54,903 --> 00:34:56,938
and Schrute are
right now.

00:34:56,938 --> 00:34:58,707
I never lied.

00:34:58,707 --> 00:35:00,709
The only thing
I'm guilty of

00:35:00,709 --> 00:35:03,478
is caring for a great man.

00:35:03,478 --> 00:35:06,815
Now sadly diminished.

00:35:06,815 --> 00:35:10,285
My only crime is not
turning him over to you.

00:35:10,285 --> 00:35:12,921
To protect his memory.

00:35:12,921 --> 00:35:16,291
The world should remember him
for what he was.

00:35:16,291 --> 00:35:17,626
(chuckles softly)

00:35:17,626 --> 00:35:18,860
Not as he is.

00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,829
RUSSELL:
Yeah, well,

00:35:20,829 --> 00:35:24,432
all we're concerned about,
Mr. Lomax, is <i>where</i> he is.

00:35:24,432 --> 00:35:26,968
And Karl Schrute.

00:35:29,471 --> 00:35:31,406
Okay.

00:35:32,908 --> 00:35:34,676
That's too bad.

00:35:34,676 --> 00:35:36,745
But I'll tell
you something.

00:35:36,745 --> 00:35:39,814
For your sake, you better hope
they're still alive.

00:35:39,814 --> 00:35:41,750
Wherever they are.

00:35:49,324 --> 00:35:50,592
Kid?

00:35:50,592 --> 00:35:53,328
If I figured it out,
and I think I have,

00:35:53,328 --> 00:35:54,329
you can, too.

00:35:54,329 --> 00:35:55,897
But you've got to look

00:35:55,897 --> 00:35:57,732
in the right place.

00:35:57,732 --> 00:36:00,335
Just like I told you a long

00:36:00,335 --> 00:36:01,803
time ago.

00:36:01,803 --> 00:36:04,673
To see the endgame,

00:36:04,673 --> 00:36:07,976
you have to see
the board through

00:36:07,976 --> 00:36:10,645
your opponent's eyes.

00:36:12,314 --> 00:36:14,482
LOMAX: Come on, kid,
moves are motivation.

00:36:14,482 --> 00:36:16,418
I'm telling you what I'm
doing, I'm telling you what

00:36:16,418 --> 00:36:18,019
I'm going to do. You got to
stop me, make it your game,

00:36:18,019 --> 00:36:19,554
not mine.

00:36:19,554 --> 00:36:20,755
That's it. Good.

00:36:20,755 --> 00:36:22,390
Come on, come on.
There you go.

00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:24,292
There you go.
Take it, take it.

00:36:24,292 --> 00:36:26,928
Don't be afraid. Take it,
take it, take it, take it.

00:36:26,928 --> 00:36:28,597
Checkmate!

00:36:30,031 --> 00:36:31,466
The endgame.

00:36:41,776 --> 00:36:44,846
It's the queen.

00:36:44,846 --> 00:36:47,515
Please be careful with those.

00:36:47,515 --> 00:36:49,851
I'd like them to make
it at least until...

00:36:49,851 --> 00:36:52,954
Phoenix.

00:36:52,954 --> 00:36:55,724
So, the tour continues.

00:36:55,724 --> 00:36:58,360
Even without its
star attraction.

00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,362
CSI Sanders.

00:37:00,362 --> 00:37:02,964
Still no word on
Mr. Schrute's whereabouts?

00:37:02,964 --> 00:37:05,033
Still playing games?

00:37:05,033 --> 00:37:06,468
Excuse me?

00:37:06,468 --> 00:37:08,470
The list of vendors
you gave us--

00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:09,638
I checked it out.

00:37:09,638 --> 00:37:11,973
You closed out all
of the accounts.

00:37:11,973 --> 00:37:13,642
Except one.

00:37:13,642 --> 00:37:16,911
A storage facility downtown
in the Alphabets.

00:37:16,911 --> 00:37:19,280
Don't worry
about it because

00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,949
we closed it for you.

00:37:20,949 --> 00:37:25,453
The same time that we rescued
Karl Schrute and Troy Parker.

00:37:25,453 --> 00:37:27,355
I get it.

00:37:27,355 --> 00:37:30,625
Men are weak, aren't they?

00:37:30,625 --> 00:37:32,894
Just like the king
on the chessboard.

00:37:32,894 --> 00:37:37,032
He hides while all the other
pieces fight to protect him.

00:37:37,032 --> 00:37:39,934
Lee Crosby was weak, too.

00:37:39,934 --> 00:37:41,069
Easily seduced

00:37:41,069 --> 00:37:43,938
into killing
for you.

00:37:43,938 --> 00:37:45,373
Am I right?

00:37:45,373 --> 00:37:46,541
What do you think?

00:37:46,541 --> 00:37:47,809
You neglected
to mention

00:37:47,809 --> 00:37:50,779
to us that you have
chess in your blood.

00:37:50,779 --> 00:37:52,313
Your father

00:37:52,313 --> 00:37:54,315
was a grandmaster.

00:37:54,315 --> 00:37:55,650
You must've learned
a lot from him.

00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:57,485
I learned nothing from him.

00:37:57,485 --> 00:38:01,356
Except that, unlike my brothers,
I was worthless.

00:38:01,356 --> 00:38:04,459
Women are worthless.

00:38:04,459 --> 00:38:06,661
My father used to say,
"Chess is a man's game

00:38:06,661 --> 00:38:10,065
because it's about power,
intellect."

00:38:10,065 --> 00:38:13,401
All things, he said,
I did not possess.

00:38:13,401 --> 00:38:15,070
But your father was wrong.

00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:16,805
Damn right he was wrong.

00:38:16,805 --> 00:38:18,540
I was better than my brothers.

00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,075
Better than him.

00:38:20,075 --> 00:38:24,279
<i>And every time I killed,</i>
<i>I was killing him.</i>

00:38:24,279 --> 00:38:28,283
So why Parker and Schrute?

00:38:28,283 --> 00:38:31,286
They were just...

00:38:31,286 --> 00:38:33,388
like him.

00:38:33,388 --> 00:38:35,356
Cut from the same cloth.

00:38:35,356 --> 00:38:37,559
So you were better
than them, too?

00:38:37,559 --> 00:38:39,661
You know, there are 32 pieces
on a chessboard--

00:38:39,661 --> 00:38:41,429
bishops, knights,

00:38:41,429 --> 00:38:44,432
pawns, kings.

00:38:44,432 --> 00:38:47,802
And yet which piece
is most powerful?

00:38:47,802 --> 00:38:49,971
The queen.

00:39:01,816 --> 00:39:03,752
♪ ♪

00:39:24,606 --> 00:39:26,541
♪ ♪

00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:50,965
(footsteps approaching)

00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,336
I was just
on my way out.

00:39:55,336 --> 00:39:56,805
Want to grab a bite?

00:39:56,805 --> 00:39:58,940
Uh, I should...
probably finish this.

00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:00,809
Thanks though.
Okay.

00:40:02,877 --> 00:40:04,078
Actually,

00:40:04,078 --> 00:40:07,515
um, you asked
why I quit playing chess.

00:40:07,515 --> 00:40:10,952
I used to think that it was

00:40:10,952 --> 00:40:14,989
because I didn't think I had
what it took to be the best.

00:40:14,989 --> 00:40:17,458
Well, that couldn't
have been it.

00:40:17,458 --> 00:40:19,460
(both chuckle)

00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:21,462
And then I realized

00:40:21,462 --> 00:40:25,333
that chess...

00:40:25,333 --> 00:40:28,002
requires a lot of sacrifice.

00:40:28,002 --> 00:40:29,771
Too much

00:40:29,771 --> 00:40:31,873
sacrifice.

00:40:31,873 --> 00:40:33,842
And I just didn't think
it was worth it.

00:40:33,842 --> 00:40:35,977
It stopped being fun.

00:40:35,977 --> 00:40:38,413
It requires a totally
different way of thinking.

00:40:38,413 --> 00:40:41,583
You have to retrain
your mind, and...

00:40:41,583 --> 00:40:43,852
it starts to become

00:40:43,852 --> 00:40:44,786
an obsession.

00:40:47,622 --> 00:40:50,491
Kind of like this job.

00:40:50,491 --> 00:40:52,026
If you know
what I mean.

00:40:52,026 --> 00:40:53,862
I do.

00:40:56,898 --> 00:40:59,767
I was not even
my grade school champion,

00:40:59,767 --> 00:41:01,636
and this is kind of crazy,
but, you know,

00:41:01,636 --> 00:41:04,973
Russell's got that chessboard
in his office. Maybe...

00:41:04,973 --> 00:41:07,942
we should get something
to eat and play.

00:41:07,942 --> 00:41:10,545
For fun?

00:41:16,017 --> 00:41:18,019
Sure.

00:41:18,019 --> 00:41:20,755
(chuckles)

00:41:20,755 --> 00:41:23,057
You better
go easy on me.

00:41:23,057 --> 00:41:26,761
I'll try.
(laughs)
