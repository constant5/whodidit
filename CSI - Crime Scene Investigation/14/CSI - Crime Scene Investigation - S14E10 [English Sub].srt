00:00:08,204 --> 00:00:09,305
Where's Russell?

00:00:09,305 --> 00:00:10,539
He's in layout.
Okay.

00:00:10,539 --> 00:00:12,375
What's going on?
Russell?

00:00:12,375 --> 00:00:14,477
Russell.

00:00:14,477 --> 00:00:16,912
It's Sara.
There's been a shooting.
How bad is it?

00:00:16,912 --> 00:00:19,382
I-I don't know.
Her cell phone cut out.
What about Finn?

00:00:19,382 --> 00:00:21,150
I can't reach her either.
Listen to me,

00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,419
I want you to call
the Sheriff's Office
in Larkston.

00:00:23,419 --> 00:00:25,354
Find out if they know
anything about the shooting.

00:00:25,354 --> 00:00:27,323
(phone keypad blipping)
Go.

00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:31,327
Jim, it's DB.

00:00:31,327 --> 00:00:32,561
I need a chopper.

00:00:32,561 --> 00:00:36,198
[chopper engine roars]

00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,475
Deputy's dead.

00:00:46,475 --> 00:00:49,545
Sheriff's still alive.

00:00:49,545 --> 00:00:50,913
STOKES:
Sara.

00:00:50,913 --> 00:00:52,782
It's been a rough 48 hours.
You all right?

00:00:52,782 --> 00:00:53,783
I'm okay.

00:00:53,783 --> 00:00:55,384
Bullet just grazed me.

00:00:55,384 --> 00:00:57,286
What about Finn--
do you know where she is?

00:00:57,286 --> 00:01:00,256
No, I don't know.
She's not picking up her cell.

00:01:00,256 --> 00:01:02,792
What if he went after her?

00:01:02,792 --> 00:01:04,493
Well...

00:01:04,493 --> 00:01:05,895
we gotta find her.

00:01:13,836 --> 00:01:15,838
(panting)

00:01:21,877 --> 00:01:23,212
Hey!

00:01:24,313 --> 00:01:27,249
Hey! Come on! Stop!

00:01:28,551 --> 00:01:29,819

00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,534

tires screeching)

So, Brass is gonna take
your statement

00:02:34,817 --> 00:02:36,852
down in the Sheriff's
Office in Larkston.

00:02:36,852 --> 00:02:39,188
Yeah, yeah, I'll go over there
as soon as we find Finn.

00:02:39,188 --> 00:02:40,890
No, no, listen
to me, please--

00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,491
there are gonna be
a lot of questions

00:02:42,491 --> 00:02:43,893
about what happened
the last couple of days.

00:02:43,893 --> 00:02:47,797
Sara, I need you to talk
to Brass now--please.

00:02:47,797 --> 00:02:49,298
Nick and I are
gonna stay here

00:02:49,298 --> 00:02:51,834
until we find Finn,
I promise you that.

00:02:51,834 --> 00:02:54,470
All right?
Mm-hmm.

00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:57,373
Come here.

00:02:57,373 --> 00:02:58,808
I'm so glad you're okay.

00:02:58,808 --> 00:03:00,876
Thank you.
Yeah.

00:03:00,876 --> 00:03:03,579
Uh, who's in charge
here, please?

00:03:03,579 --> 00:03:06,415
I...I-I guess
that would be me.

00:03:06,415 --> 00:03:08,184
Yeah.
Uh, Maxine Lennox.

00:03:08,184 --> 00:03:11,454
Deputy Lennox, I'm CSI
Supervisor Russell.

00:03:11,454 --> 00:03:13,155
One of my CSIs is missing.

00:03:13,155 --> 00:03:15,558
She was investigating
a case up here.

00:03:15,558 --> 00:03:17,593
Her name's
Julie Finlay.
Yes.

00:03:17,593 --> 00:03:19,228
I saw her a few hours ago
at the motel.

00:03:19,228 --> 00:03:20,429
Lent her my car.

00:03:20,429 --> 00:03:22,264
She said she was
following up on a lead.

00:03:22,264 --> 00:03:23,632
Did she say where
she was going?

00:03:23,632 --> 00:03:26,202
No.
I need you to
put a broadcast out

00:03:26,202 --> 00:03:28,437
on your car, right now.
Yes, sir.

00:03:28,437 --> 00:03:29,772
Have a seat.
We'll be right with you.

00:03:31,574 --> 00:03:33,609
BRASS: I got you this;
I thought you could use it.

00:03:33,609 --> 00:03:34,610
Thank you.

00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:35,911
How you holding up?

00:03:35,911 --> 00:03:39,748
It's been a long couple of days.

00:03:39,748 --> 00:03:41,917
Well, uh, I know things might
be a little cloudy for you

00:03:41,917 --> 00:03:43,619
right now, but, uh...

00:03:43,619 --> 00:03:45,921
You know, we have
to officially

00:03:45,921 --> 00:03:48,357
get a statement to know
what happened up here.

00:03:48,357 --> 00:03:50,226
I know the drill.

00:03:50,226 --> 00:03:51,494
(recorder beeps)

00:03:51,494 --> 00:03:52,895
Let's start from
the beginning.

00:03:52,895 --> 00:03:55,130
What were you and
CSIs Finlay and Brody

00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:57,466
doing here in Larkston?

00:03:57,466 --> 00:03:59,768
Larkston was never
part of the plan.

00:03:59,768 --> 00:04:02,204
We just wanted to have
a little fun, I mean...

00:04:02,204 --> 00:04:05,341
how often do we all
have the weekend off?

00:04:08,644 --> 00:04:12,281
Whew! I am gonna go home,
open a bottle of wine

00:04:12,281 --> 00:04:13,883
and watch Hepburn
and Tracy movies.

00:04:13,883 --> 00:04:15,918
Oh, wish
I could do that.

00:04:15,918 --> 00:04:18,287
I've got about a month's
worth of laundry to do.

00:04:18,287 --> 00:04:19,388
Ugh.

00:04:19,388 --> 00:04:20,756
What are you
up to, Morgan?

00:04:20,756 --> 00:04:23,292
Uh, actually,
I am driving to Reno.

00:04:23,292 --> 00:04:26,595
My mom got me this gift
certificate for a spa there.

00:04:26,595 --> 00:04:28,731
It has all mineral-based
treatments,

00:04:28,731 --> 00:04:30,733
so I am getting
the amethyst massage.

00:04:30,733 --> 00:04:32,434
It's supposed to calm the nerves

00:04:32,434 --> 00:04:34,169
and absorb negative energy.

00:04:34,169 --> 00:04:35,838
I could probably use that.

00:04:35,838 --> 00:04:37,907
Yeah, me, too.

00:04:37,907 --> 00:04:39,308
You guys should join me.

00:04:39,308 --> 00:04:40,509
I got a suite.

00:04:40,509 --> 00:04:41,510
Got plenty of room.

00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:43,612
Oh, I...I mean,

00:04:43,612 --> 00:04:44,914
we don't want
to crash your weekend.

00:04:44,914 --> 00:04:46,782
Are you kidding?
I would love it.

00:04:46,782 --> 00:04:48,350
I hate drinking alone.

00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:50,519
Massages, alcohol...

00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:51,687
I'm in.

00:04:51,687 --> 00:04:54,156
I'm in.
(Finn laughs)

00:04:54,156 --> 00:04:56,191
Awesome! Okay...um,
let's go home, change,

00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,726
and I'll meet you
back here in an hour.

00:04:57,726 --> 00:04:59,395
Okay.
Okay.

00:04:59,395 --> 00:05:00,930
BRASS:
<i>But you never made it to Reno.</i>

00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:02,731
Why not?

00:05:02,731 --> 00:05:04,433
Finn said that
if we took her car,

00:05:04,433 --> 00:05:06,268
we could make it there
in half the time.

00:05:06,268 --> 00:05:08,604

So, Darryl, uh,
what's the bottom line?

00:05:49,612 --> 00:05:51,880
Can you fix it?
Uh, yeah, it's just
a broken water pump.

00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,183

salt scrubs.

00:06:03,225 --> 00:06:05,561
I can give you ladies
a lift into Larkston.

00:06:05,561 --> 00:06:07,863
We don't have a spa,
but we do have a nice motel.

00:06:07,863 --> 00:06:10,766

at the Cactus.

00:06:12,601 --> 00:06:14,336

and you turn into
Janis Joplin.

00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,799
Yeah, I think you
missed your calling.

00:07:16,799 --> 00:07:19,334
Like, awesome! Wow!
Thanks.
Yeah, uh, well,

00:07:19,334 --> 00:07:20,669
I was a double major
in college.

00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:22,738
Chemistry and voice.
Chose chemistry.

00:07:22,738 --> 00:07:26,375
But I was the front woman for
a band at The Roxy for a year.

00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,177
I can't believe we didn't
know this about you.

00:07:29,478 --> 00:07:31,213
Speaking of secrets,

00:07:31,213 --> 00:07:32,648
I didn't know you were
into mechanics.

00:07:32,648 --> 00:07:35,150
Yeah, you and,
um, Darryl...

00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,919
seem to be enjoying
each other's company tonight

00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:39,588
He's very nice.
He's, uh, he's actually smart.

00:07:39,588 --> 00:07:40,723
BRODY:
Oh.

00:07:40,723 --> 00:07:42,691
(laughs)

00:07:44,693 --> 00:07:46,695
He's, uh, he's funny.

00:07:46,695 --> 00:07:48,497
Knows a lot about cars.

00:07:48,497 --> 00:07:50,499
Oh. It's too bad
he's so unattractive.

00:07:50,499 --> 00:07:53,135
(laughs)

00:07:53,135 --> 00:07:54,770
This round's on Darryl.

00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,371
Thank you.
Oh, thank you.

00:07:56,371 --> 00:07:57,873
BRODY:
Thank <i>you.</i>

00:07:57,873 --> 00:08:00,576
All right, here's
to our girls' weekend.

00:08:00,576 --> 00:08:01,610
Yes.

00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:03,612
(whooping)

00:08:03,612 --> 00:08:04,747
(laughs)

00:08:07,816 --> 00:08:10,619
Oh, God. Aah.
Whee.

00:08:10,619 --> 00:08:12,755
(Finn laughs)
BRODY: Whoo!

00:08:12,755 --> 00:08:15,824
All right, so I'm gonna,
um, go back to the motel.

00:08:15,824 --> 00:08:17,426
No, I-I put in
a Beyoncé song,

00:08:17,426 --> 00:08:18,894
I want us all to
sing it together.

00:08:18,894 --> 00:08:19,928
I'll come with you.

00:08:19,928 --> 00:08:20,929
Hey.
No, stay.

00:08:20,929 --> 00:08:22,598
Stay, have fun.

00:08:22,598 --> 00:08:23,899
Darryl's gonna walk me home.

00:08:23,899 --> 00:08:26,502
We need to finish
the conversation.

00:08:26,502 --> 00:08:27,503
Uh-huh.

00:08:27,503 --> 00:08:29,404
Of course you do.

00:08:29,404 --> 00:08:30,773
(Finn laughs)

00:08:30,773 --> 00:08:31,840
See you guys later.

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,243
Okay. Have fun.

00:08:34,243 --> 00:08:35,444
BRODY:
Yeah, right.

00:08:36,912 --> 00:08:38,247
Who's Beyoncé?

00:08:44,319 --> 00:08:47,656
The stars are really
beautiful out here.

00:08:47,656 --> 00:08:49,391
There's so many lights
in Vegas, you know,

00:08:49,391 --> 00:08:51,160
you never
get to see them.

00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,829
Yeah, I guess I don't
really notice them anymore.

00:08:53,829 --> 00:08:55,464
Born and raised here.

00:08:55,464 --> 00:08:58,267
I guess I kind of
take them for granted.

00:09:00,235 --> 00:09:01,503
Was it great growing up here?

00:09:01,503 --> 00:09:02,638
Yeah, it was great.

00:09:02,638 --> 00:09:03,705
Was it?
It was real great.

00:09:03,705 --> 00:09:05,207
Must have been.
Mm-hmm.

00:09:16,251 --> 00:09:17,252
(Finlay laughs)

00:09:17,252 --> 00:09:19,855
Oh...yeah.

00:09:19,855 --> 00:09:21,557
Oops. (chuckles)

00:09:21,557 --> 00:09:23,892
You have something
in your pocket.

00:09:23,892 --> 00:09:28,297
You mean, um...

00:09:28,297 --> 00:09:29,565
You mean this.

00:09:29,565 --> 00:09:30,566
Mm-hmm.

00:09:30,566 --> 00:09:32,801
You got me.

00:09:32,801 --> 00:09:35,337
I'm not really
into married men.

00:09:35,337 --> 00:09:36,672
Or liars.

00:09:37,906 --> 00:09:39,908
I'm not lying anymore.

00:09:39,908 --> 00:09:41,343
You're still married.

00:09:41,343 --> 00:09:44,646
Not happily.

00:09:46,815 --> 00:09:49,318
Good night.

00:09:49,318 --> 00:09:50,452
(grunts quietly)

00:09:53,522 --> 00:09:54,656
Night?

00:09:57,326 --> 00:10:00,195
You're a little tease,
you know that?

00:10:00,195 --> 00:10:01,530
Darryl, don't do this.

00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:02,731
Oh, you're not going anywhere.

00:10:02,731 --> 00:10:04,166
You think you can
just lead me on

00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:06,602
all night and then
just walk away?

00:10:06,602 --> 00:10:08,470
Don't do this.
(grunts)

00:10:09,838 --> 00:10:11,540
(gasps)

00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:12,741
I don't want to hurt you.

00:10:12,741 --> 00:10:14,176
But I will.

00:10:15,811 --> 00:10:18,513
(grunting)

00:10:24,453 --> 00:10:26,221
(panting)

00:10:28,657 --> 00:10:30,192
You're dead.

00:10:41,403 --> 00:10:43,405
(Sara speaks quietly)

00:10:47,309 --> 00:10:48,377
What happened?

00:10:48,377 --> 00:10:49,611
Oh, my God,

00:10:49,611 --> 00:10:51,546
you're bleeding.
I stabbed him.

00:10:51,546 --> 00:10:53,382
BRODY: What are you
talking about?
FINN: He attacked me.

00:10:53,382 --> 00:10:55,217
What?
I think he's dead.

00:10:56,285 --> 00:10:57,719
Darlene, call the sheriff.

00:10:57,719 --> 00:10:59,454
Finn, what happened?

00:10:59,454 --> 00:11:01,857
I don't know.

00:11:01,857 --> 00:11:04,526
Okay, we got to get you to
a hospital--you need stitches.

00:11:04,526 --> 00:11:05,928
I don't want to go
to the hospital.

00:11:05,928 --> 00:11:07,529
Where's Darryl?

00:11:07,529 --> 00:11:10,465
He's-he's over here.
Show us.

00:11:13,302 --> 00:11:15,304
(panting)

00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:24,179
His body was right here.

00:11:24,179 --> 00:11:26,748
Where'd it go?

00:11:30,886 --> 00:11:33,622
How many times
did you stab him?
I stabbed him twice.

00:11:33,622 --> 00:11:34,823
What did you do
with the knife?

00:11:34,823 --> 00:11:38,360
Uh, I-I-I dropped it
beside the body.

00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,695
Maybe you didn't kill him, Finn.

00:11:39,695 --> 00:11:41,296
Maybe he's not dead.
Did you take

00:11:41,296 --> 00:11:43,565
his pulse?
No, no, I wanted to get away.

00:11:43,565 --> 00:11:45,834
I-I'm sure he was not moving.

00:11:45,834 --> 00:11:47,402
It's okay. All right?

00:11:47,402 --> 00:11:49,171
It's gonna be all right.

00:11:49,171 --> 00:11:51,273
All right.

00:11:51,273 --> 00:11:54,343
They're not flags,
but they'll have to do.

00:11:54,343 --> 00:11:55,877
Really hard to tell
how much blood he lost.

00:11:55,877 --> 00:11:58,380
It seeped into
the dirt.

00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,749
There are blood drops moving
away from the blood pool.

00:12:02,884 --> 00:12:06,588
Hey, Finn, was Darryl
wearing cowboy boots?

00:12:06,588 --> 00:12:08,290
Yeah.

00:12:11,426 --> 00:12:13,295
SIDLE:
I got a boot print.

00:12:13,295 --> 00:12:15,564
(siren wailing in distance)
and corresponding
blood drops.

00:12:15,564 --> 00:12:17,666
He was on his feet
and bleeding.

00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:19,668
Ah, I didn't kill him.
He walked away.

00:12:19,668 --> 00:12:21,770
SIDLE: There's a second set
of prints, so...

00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:23,505
not by himself.
Somebody helped him.

00:12:23,505 --> 00:12:24,606
BRODY:
Into a car.

00:12:24,606 --> 00:12:26,241
Blood drops end...

00:12:26,241 --> 00:12:27,809
where these tire tracks begin.

00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,515
(siren stops)

00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,654
What the hell
you girls think

00:12:39,654 --> 00:12:41,390
you're doing?
It's all right.

00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:44,559
Sheriff, we're law enforcement--
Las Vegas CSIs

00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:46,428
Sidle, Finlay and Brody.

00:12:46,428 --> 00:12:48,330
Las Vegas Crime Lab?

00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:50,565
I didn't call you
to work this scene.

00:12:50,565 --> 00:12:52,367
Uh, we're not
working the scene.

00:12:52,367 --> 00:12:54,469
Our friend here
was attacked.
I got a phone call

00:12:54,469 --> 00:12:57,205
saying you killed him.

00:12:57,205 --> 00:12:59,741
Well, the evidence shows
that Darryl is still alive.

00:12:59,741 --> 00:13:01,343
Evidence?

00:13:01,343 --> 00:13:02,778
Thought you said you weren't
working the scene.

00:13:02,778 --> 00:13:04,279
We're not working
the scene.

00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:05,680
We just made a couple
of observations.

00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,582
Uh-huh.

00:13:07,582 --> 00:13:09,584
Yeah.

00:13:09,584 --> 00:13:12,587
Yeah, I'm making a few
of those myself.

00:13:12,587 --> 00:13:14,790
Three girls; been drinking...

00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:17,559
one bleeding...
messing around

00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:20,262
in a crime scene
you got no business being in.

00:13:20,262 --> 00:13:22,898
We're not
messing around.

00:13:22,898 --> 00:13:24,866
How do I know
you didn't kill him?

00:13:24,866 --> 00:13:27,469
Dumped his body
somewhere.

00:13:29,271 --> 00:13:30,472
Now you're tampering
with the evidence.

00:13:30,472 --> 00:13:32,140
Mm-hmm.

00:13:36,912 --> 00:13:38,747
So he just released you?
No.

00:13:38,747 --> 00:13:40,649
No. His deputies
separated Morgan and I,

00:13:40,649 --> 00:13:43,151
and, uh, they interrogated us
inside the bar.

00:13:43,151 --> 00:13:44,386
What about Finn?
Sheriff put her

00:13:44,386 --> 00:13:45,821
under house arrest in the motel.

00:13:45,821 --> 00:13:47,289
Finn said that he grilled her

00:13:47,289 --> 00:13:49,691
while the local doctor
stitched her up.

00:13:49,691 --> 00:13:53,728
So you're saying
the knife...

00:13:53,728 --> 00:13:54,796
was Darryl's?

00:13:54,796 --> 00:13:56,198
Yes.

00:13:56,198 --> 00:13:57,566
How'd it end up
in your hands?

00:13:57,566 --> 00:13:58,700
I told you:

00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,469
He pulled the knife,

00:14:00,469 --> 00:14:01,536
he tried to rape me,

00:14:01,536 --> 00:14:03,472
I grabbed the knife

00:14:03,472 --> 00:14:05,507
and I fought back.

00:14:05,507 --> 00:14:07,442
Oh.

00:14:07,442 --> 00:14:09,277
Look at these bruises,
Sheriff.

00:14:09,277 --> 00:14:10,912
Consistent with
a struggle.

00:14:10,912 --> 00:14:12,614
Hmm.

00:14:12,614 --> 00:14:14,749
So you stabbed him
in self-defense

00:14:14,749 --> 00:14:16,852
and in that few minutes,
while you were inside the bar

00:14:16,852 --> 00:14:18,553
telling your friends,

00:14:18,553 --> 00:14:20,555
someone took Darryl
and the knife.
Yes.

00:14:20,555 --> 00:14:22,691
And he is out there,
and I-I think

00:14:22,691 --> 00:14:25,627
you should be out there
looking for him.
Oh, I got deputies

00:14:25,627 --> 00:14:27,863
going to his house
and his auto shop.

00:14:27,863 --> 00:14:30,765
But, frankly...
(grunts)

00:14:30,765 --> 00:14:34,536
you could save us
all a lot of time.

00:14:34,536 --> 00:14:36,605
Just tell us the truth.

00:14:38,907 --> 00:14:42,244
I am telling you the truth.

00:14:42,244 --> 00:14:46,581
I am a CSI, and I deserve
the benefit of the doubt.

00:14:46,581 --> 00:14:49,384
I've known Darryl Walsh
for 15 years.

00:14:49,384 --> 00:14:51,686
I play poker with him
every other Thursday.

00:14:51,686 --> 00:14:54,890
It just doesn't seem
like something he'd do.

00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:57,726
Ms. Finlay didn't inflict
these wounds herself.

00:14:57,726 --> 00:15:00,395
Come on, Owen,
she's been through enough.

00:15:00,395 --> 00:15:02,330
Do you really have to keep her
locked up here like a prisoner?

00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:05,367
Until I figure out what
happened to Darryl...

00:15:05,367 --> 00:15:06,868
she's not going anywhere.

00:15:08,803 --> 00:15:10,739
You do your job, Marty;
I'll do mine.

00:15:13,675 --> 00:15:15,177
MARTY:
All done.

00:15:15,177 --> 00:15:17,812
You're gonna be just fine.

00:15:17,812 --> 00:15:19,447
(voice breaking):
Thanks.

00:15:22,651 --> 00:15:24,152
(phone ringing)

00:15:24,152 --> 00:15:25,787
Any sign of Finn?

00:15:25,787 --> 00:15:27,856
No.

00:15:27,856 --> 00:15:29,291
Russell just texted.

00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:30,825
They're still following up
on leads.

00:15:30,825 --> 00:15:33,295
So, CSI Brody took
photographs of the crime scene

00:15:33,295 --> 00:15:36,198
which you believe prove that
Darryl Walsh was still alive.

00:15:36,198 --> 00:15:38,166
Now, did you share those
photos with the deputies

00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:39,534
who questioned you?
Yes. Of course.

00:15:39,534 --> 00:15:40,902
I mean, it wasn't our scene.

00:15:40,902 --> 00:15:44,172
We were legally obligated
to turn 'em over.

00:15:44,172 --> 00:15:47,409
But Morgan didn't delete them
from her cell phone, did she?

00:16:00,222 --> 00:16:01,456
(computer blipping)

00:16:04,359 --> 00:16:05,560
(computer beeping)

00:16:08,563 --> 00:16:09,631
(auto-dial beeping)

00:16:09,631 --> 00:16:11,233
(line ringing)

00:16:11,233 --> 00:16:13,802
Hey, Greg.
Hey. That, uh, tire track photo

00:16:13,802 --> 00:16:16,838
that you guys sent me from the
crime scene, I ran it through

00:16:16,838 --> 00:16:18,907
Treadfind--
tire was manufactured

00:16:18,907 --> 00:16:22,477
by Bridgman Wheels in 2008.

00:16:22,477 --> 00:16:24,646
What kind of car?
A truck, actually.

00:16:24,646 --> 00:16:27,716
Primarily the Ford Ranger
and F-150.

00:16:27,716 --> 00:16:30,852
I pulled DMV records.
Sending you a list

00:16:30,852 --> 00:16:32,754
of everyone in Larkston

00:16:32,754 --> 00:16:33,822
who owns that vehicle.

00:16:33,822 --> 00:16:36,791
Pulling it up now. Thank you.

00:16:37,859 --> 00:16:40,228
Hey, Sheriff?
Yeah.

00:16:40,228 --> 00:16:41,630
According to DMV records,

00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:44,532
there's over 30 vehicles
in this town with tires

00:16:44,532 --> 00:16:47,535
that match the tracks that
we found at the crime scene.

00:16:49,304 --> 00:16:50,772
Well, the last I checked,

00:16:50,772 --> 00:16:52,641
you weren't part of
this investigation.

00:16:52,641 --> 00:16:54,609
BRODY: Sheriff,
evidence shows

00:16:54,609 --> 00:16:56,578
that somebody helped
Darryl Walsh into a truck.

00:16:56,578 --> 00:16:58,413
We find the truck,
maybe we find Darryl.

00:16:58,413 --> 00:17:00,181
It exonerates CSI Finlay.

00:17:00,181 --> 00:17:01,249
You really think
he's still alive?

00:17:01,249 --> 00:17:02,250
There were
no drag marks.

00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,185
Boot prints
and blood drops show

00:17:04,185 --> 00:17:06,554
that he was upright and moving
when he got into the truck.

00:17:06,554 --> 00:17:08,223
BRODY: You've searched his home,
you've searched his work.

00:17:08,223 --> 00:17:09,691
You haven't found him.

00:17:09,691 --> 00:17:11,493
This list is the closest thing
we have to a lead.

00:17:11,493 --> 00:17:12,927
All we're asking is
that you take a look at it.

00:17:12,927 --> 00:17:14,829
Is there anyone
on here that might

00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:17,132
put themselves on the line
for Darryl?

00:17:17,132 --> 00:17:19,401
(sighs)
All right.

00:17:24,906 --> 00:17:26,574
Valerie Irvin, Darryl's wife.

00:17:26,574 --> 00:17:29,477
Great. Let's go talk to her.
We can't.

00:17:29,477 --> 00:17:32,147
She left for Vegas
this morning.

00:17:32,147 --> 00:17:33,581
BRODY:
I'll call Greg right away.

00:17:33,581 --> 00:17:35,283
<i>Have him bring her in</i>
<i>for questioning.</i>

00:17:38,153 --> 00:17:39,354
You don't seem
too worried

00:17:39,354 --> 00:17:41,289
about your husband,
Mrs. Irvin.

00:17:41,289 --> 00:17:42,691
I mean, Darryl was stabbed.

00:17:42,691 --> 00:17:43,892
Now he's missing.

00:17:43,892 --> 00:17:45,327
And you're playing slots

00:17:45,327 --> 00:17:47,295
in Vegas.
Oh, he'll turn up.

00:17:47,295 --> 00:17:48,663
He always does.

00:17:48,663 --> 00:17:50,598
So he's gone missing before?

00:17:50,598 --> 00:17:52,233
(wry laugh)

00:17:52,233 --> 00:17:54,169
We don't really keep tabs
on each other.

00:17:54,169 --> 00:17:56,471
Darryl does his thing.

00:17:56,471 --> 00:17:58,239
I do mine.

00:17:58,239 --> 00:18:01,276
Uh, last night, after Darryl
was stabbed, back in Larkston,

00:18:01,276 --> 00:18:03,478
somebody picked him up
from the motel.

00:18:03,478 --> 00:18:05,547
Wasn't me.

00:18:05,547 --> 00:18:07,649
I was working all night
at the diner, 6:00 to 6:00.

00:18:07,649 --> 00:18:09,351
I drove straight here
after my shift.

00:18:10,452 --> 00:18:15,457
Uh, we searched your truck.

00:18:15,457 --> 00:18:17,492
Found this...

00:18:17,492 --> 00:18:19,294
stuck to the floor mat.

00:18:20,362 --> 00:18:22,197
What is that?

00:18:22,197 --> 00:18:23,631
SIDLE:
<i>It was a high resin leaf,</i>

00:18:23,631 --> 00:18:26,568
along with expanded
clay pebbles.

00:18:26,568 --> 00:18:28,236
Marijuana.

00:18:28,236 --> 00:18:31,206
I get it--so Darryl was
running a hydroponic

00:18:31,206 --> 00:18:34,409
pot-growing operation
under the radar.

00:18:34,409 --> 00:18:36,277
Thing about hydroponics--

00:18:36,277 --> 00:18:38,313
it requires a lot of energy.

00:18:38,313 --> 00:18:39,647
HODGES: I pulled up
the electrical grid

00:18:39,647 --> 00:18:41,216
of the town of Larkston.

00:18:41,216 --> 00:18:43,251
The blue dots
represent average

00:18:43,251 --> 00:18:46,821
household electrical use
per month, about 900 kilowatts.

00:18:46,821 --> 00:18:47,822
Well, they're all blue dots.

00:18:47,822 --> 00:18:49,424
A grow house would use at least

00:18:49,424 --> 00:18:50,725
five times that much power.

00:18:50,725 --> 00:18:53,161
Now, step back in time with me

00:18:53,161 --> 00:18:55,163
as we follow the "current"

00:18:55,163 --> 00:18:56,798
back to the past.

00:18:56,798 --> 00:18:58,700
This is a time lapse reversal
of the town's

00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,202
electrical use
over the past year.

00:19:01,202 --> 00:19:04,506
There's your red dot--indicates
usage of over 5,000 kilowatts

00:19:04,506 --> 00:19:06,408
a month for
four months.

00:19:06,408 --> 00:19:08,243
Goes back to normal for a month

00:19:08,243 --> 00:19:09,778
and then spikes again
for another four months.

00:19:09,778 --> 00:19:11,179
SANDERS: Typical growth

00:19:11,179 --> 00:19:13,248
and harvest cycle
for marijuana.

00:19:13,248 --> 00:19:15,717
Four months to grow,
one month to dry.

00:19:15,717 --> 00:19:17,485
And only minutes to enjoy it.

00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,922
So I've heard.

00:19:20,922 --> 00:19:22,690
So what is that,
a house?

00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:25,860
Well, according to
the satellite image,

00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,296
it's a dilapidated barn,
registered

00:19:28,296 --> 00:19:30,198
to Edith Skinner.

00:19:30,198 --> 00:19:32,267
She's 85.

00:19:41,509 --> 00:19:44,245
DEPUTY: Think old lady Skinner
has any idea

00:19:44,245 --> 00:19:46,314
what Darryl and Val are doing
in her barn?

00:19:46,314 --> 00:19:48,283
SHERIFF:
I just talked to her.

00:19:48,283 --> 00:19:51,286
Darryl told her he was
storing some cars here.

00:19:51,286 --> 00:19:52,487
Put that thing away.

00:19:52,487 --> 00:19:54,155
Darryl could be hiding
in here somewhere.

00:19:54,155 --> 00:19:55,190
I'm not taking any chances.

00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:57,225
Willis, pop the trunk.

00:19:57,225 --> 00:19:59,360
He's not the monster
you're making him out to be.

00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,429
No offense, Sheriff,
but I'm not sure you know Darryl

00:20:01,429 --> 00:20:02,630
the way you think you do.

00:20:07,135 --> 00:20:09,204
Plates are all
from out of state.

00:20:09,204 --> 00:20:11,139
SHERIFF: Well, Darryl could've
bought 'em for spare parts.

00:20:11,139 --> 00:20:13,541
Or, in addition
to growing pot,

00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:15,844
he's running a chop shop.

00:20:19,814 --> 00:20:22,317
No sign of him.

00:20:32,827 --> 00:20:35,296
(groans)

00:20:35,296 --> 00:20:37,432
Sheriff, Deputy,
take a look at this.

00:20:40,835 --> 00:20:42,770
Oh, my God.

00:20:50,345 --> 00:20:52,280
You still think
your friend's not a monster?

00:20:58,219 --> 00:21:00,154
(camera shutter clicking)

00:21:04,726 --> 00:21:06,461
All right. Let's do it.

00:21:19,807 --> 00:21:21,709
All right.

00:21:21,709 --> 00:21:25,213
Blunt force trauma
to the head and face.

00:21:26,748 --> 00:21:30,351
Compound fracture
to the right forearm.

00:21:30,351 --> 00:21:32,487
It looks like
she was beaten to death.

00:21:32,487 --> 00:21:35,557
When I have to put
on my coroner's hat,

00:21:35,557 --> 00:21:39,294
death is usually natural causes
or car accidents.

00:21:39,294 --> 00:21:41,362
Don't see violence
like this very often.

00:21:41,362 --> 00:21:43,865
Wish we could say
the same.
Yeah.

00:21:43,865 --> 00:21:46,501
No identification.

00:21:48,703 --> 00:21:51,773
There's a green residue
on the shoes here--hmm.

00:21:54,876 --> 00:21:56,878
Didn't come from the car.

00:21:56,878 --> 00:21:59,180
Do you mind
if I collect it?

00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:01,382
Not at all.
There's no fresh blood.

00:22:01,382 --> 00:22:03,751
There's no evidence
that Darryl was here last night.

00:22:03,751 --> 00:22:05,420
Wife's alibi checked out.

00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,821
Val wasn't the one
that picked him up.

00:22:06,821 --> 00:22:08,723
Maybe one of his buddies
gave him a ride,

00:22:08,723 --> 00:22:10,458
and he's hiding
him somewhere.

00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:13,328
Val said that she had no idea
what Darryl was doing up here.

00:22:13,328 --> 00:22:15,196
Said that he borrows
her truck all the time.

00:22:15,196 --> 00:22:17,665
It could explain
the pebbles and the cannabis.

00:22:17,665 --> 00:22:19,901
I'll run the license and
registration on these vehicles.

00:22:19,901 --> 00:22:21,669
See if we can figure out
who they belong to.

00:22:21,669 --> 00:22:23,705
Thanks.
Uh, Sheriff...

00:22:23,705 --> 00:22:26,608
I would really like CSI Finlay
to help us out on the case.

00:22:26,608 --> 00:22:28,142
There's no reason

00:22:28,142 --> 00:22:29,644
to keep her locked up
in that motel room.

00:22:29,644 --> 00:22:31,179
She still stabbed Darryl.

00:22:31,179 --> 00:22:32,513
In self defense.

00:22:32,513 --> 00:22:34,382
But she had nothing to do
with this crime scene,

00:22:34,382 --> 00:22:35,817
and frankly...

00:22:35,817 --> 00:22:37,452
we could really use her help.

00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:40,455
Fine.

00:22:40,455 --> 00:22:42,757
I'll lift the house arrest,
but she's not leaving town.

00:22:42,757 --> 00:22:44,492
One more thing...

00:22:45,893 --> 00:22:47,695
Anyone ever tell
you you're pushy?

00:22:47,695 --> 00:22:49,263
(wry laugh)

00:22:49,263 --> 00:22:51,399
I just need DNA samples
from everyone here,

00:22:51,399 --> 00:22:53,201
for elimination purposes.

00:22:53,201 --> 00:22:54,769
What, you think one of us had
something to do with this?

00:22:54,769 --> 00:22:56,537
Just procedure.

00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,175
BRASS:
<i>Then what happened?</i>

00:23:01,175 --> 00:23:02,810
SIDLE:
<i>Morgan took those samples</i>
<i>back to the lab.</i>

00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:05,546
What about the body--did
Dr. Kinney do the autopsy?

00:23:05,546 --> 00:23:07,248
No. No.

00:23:07,248 --> 00:23:09,584
Because of his limited
experience in forensic
pathology,

00:23:09,584 --> 00:23:11,786
Morgan took the body
back to Vegas as well.

00:23:11,786 --> 00:23:14,188
She handed it off
to David Phillips.

00:23:18,292 --> 00:23:20,928
So, let me get
this straight.

00:23:20,928 --> 00:23:25,133
Finn, Morgan and Sara go away
for a nice fun weekend,

00:23:25,133 --> 00:23:26,834
Finn is then attacked,

00:23:26,834 --> 00:23:28,703
accused of murder

00:23:28,703 --> 00:23:30,805
and Sara finds a body?

00:23:30,805 --> 00:23:32,373
Yeah.

00:23:32,373 --> 00:23:34,642
Not the relaxing weekend
they were hoping for.

00:23:34,642 --> 00:23:38,212
Hey, David, there's a 419
at the Mediterranean.

00:23:38,212 --> 00:23:40,748
I'm on it.

00:23:43,618 --> 00:23:46,187
SANDERS:
Pumpkins painted on her nails.

00:23:46,187 --> 00:23:47,455
Must've liked Halloween.

00:23:47,455 --> 00:23:49,490
That could be
when she went missing.

00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:51,159
I'll rehydrate
her fingertip,

00:23:51,159 --> 00:23:52,660
see if we can get an I.D.

00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:53,828
Based on the temperature
of the building

00:23:53,828 --> 00:23:56,264
and the condition
of the body,

00:23:56,264 --> 00:23:58,800
I'd say she's been dead
less than a month.

00:24:00,301 --> 00:24:02,370
SANDERS:
These look like ligature marks.

00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:03,805
Narrow.

00:24:03,805 --> 00:24:06,174
Killer must've used
a string to tie her up.

00:24:06,174 --> 00:24:07,508
Maybe wire.

00:24:07,508 --> 00:24:09,711
Restrained and beaten.

00:24:09,711 --> 00:24:11,746
Circular size and
shape tell me

00:24:11,746 --> 00:24:13,214
she was hit repeatedly
with a hammer.

00:24:13,214 --> 00:24:15,616
Any idea how old she was?

00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:18,853
Wisdom teeth are present,
so she's over 18.

00:24:20,455 --> 00:24:22,657
And there's something
in her teeth.

00:24:22,657 --> 00:24:23,925
Could you hold that?

00:24:33,634 --> 00:24:35,803
Looks like a pubic hair.

00:24:35,803 --> 00:24:38,573
Suggests sexual activity
close to the time of death.

00:24:38,573 --> 00:24:40,608
ROBBINS: Considering that
she was restrained,

00:24:40,608 --> 00:24:43,311
I'm betting the sex
wasn't consensual.

00:24:43,311 --> 00:24:44,879
I'll collect an SAE kit.

00:24:44,879 --> 00:24:46,848
Follicle is still attached.

00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:48,182
Should be able to get DNA.

00:24:48,182 --> 00:24:50,384
Might help us
identify her killer.

00:24:53,888 --> 00:24:56,157
RUSSELL (over phone):
What did you find out?

00:24:56,157 --> 00:24:57,792
FINLAY: Victim's name
is Brenda Whittaker.

00:24:57,792 --> 00:25:00,762
She is a 23-year-old
from San Diego.

00:25:00,762 --> 00:25:02,764
Disappeared four months ago.

00:25:02,764 --> 00:25:05,500
Cross-referenced her driver's
license and registration

00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,435
and prints confirmed it was her.

00:25:07,435 --> 00:25:09,704
Held against her will and raped.

00:25:09,704 --> 00:25:13,174
Spermatozoa was found in the
oral, anal and vaginal samples

00:25:13,174 --> 00:25:14,776
collected from the victim.

00:25:14,776 --> 00:25:16,377
Still waiting on the DNA.

00:25:16,377 --> 00:25:18,379
Which will prove
Darryl's a murderer.

00:25:18,379 --> 00:25:19,914
Can't believe
he's still out there.

00:25:19,914 --> 00:25:22,683
Which is why you better
watch your back.

00:25:22,683 --> 00:25:24,819
Tell me about the other cars
in the barn.

00:25:24,819 --> 00:25:26,921
They belong to two other
missing women.

00:25:26,921 --> 00:25:30,191
A 19-year-old college student
from Sedona

00:25:30,191 --> 00:25:33,828
and a 28-year-old waitress
from Salt Lake City--

00:25:33,828 --> 00:25:36,864
both missing for over a year
and both traveling alone.

00:25:36,864 --> 00:25:38,900
Darryl's a mechanic, right?

00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:42,503
Yeah, he operates a gas station
and a garage.

00:25:42,503 --> 00:25:47,575
So maybe these women had
car trouble, stopped for gas.

00:25:47,575 --> 00:25:49,744
Just happened
to be Darryl's type.

00:25:49,744 --> 00:25:51,913
He seduced them, abducted them,

00:25:51,913 --> 00:25:54,615
raped them,
and probably killed them.

00:25:54,615 --> 00:25:58,419
Brenda Whittaker
was the only one found.

00:25:58,419 --> 00:26:00,555
Darryl must've dumped the other
bodies someplace else.

00:26:00,555 --> 00:26:02,390
(phone buzzing)
Oh, hey. This is Hodges.

00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:03,758
I have to go.

00:26:03,758 --> 00:26:04,759
Oh, go ahead.

00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:07,361
What have you got?

00:26:07,361 --> 00:26:09,463
Trace Morgan collected
from the victim's shoes--

00:26:09,463 --> 00:26:10,464
<i>Pediastrum boryanum.</i>

00:26:10,464 --> 00:26:11,899
Algae?

00:26:11,899 --> 00:26:15,136
Specifically green algae
found in fresh water.

00:26:15,136 --> 00:26:16,604
I did some checking,

00:26:16,604 --> 00:26:18,506
and the nearest large body
of fresh water

00:26:18,506 --> 00:26:20,741
is over 150 miles away.

00:26:20,741 --> 00:26:22,844
That doesn't make any sense.

00:26:22,844 --> 00:26:26,280
RUSSELL:
<i>Finn was here when we spoke</i>
<i>on the phone last night,</i>

00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:29,217
so this is the last place
she was seen.

00:26:29,217 --> 00:26:30,284
And that was...

00:26:30,284 --> 00:26:31,919
a few hours ago.

00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,755
Well, we know she borrowed
the deputy's car.

00:26:35,857 --> 00:26:37,525
Where was she going?

00:26:37,525 --> 00:26:39,227
RUSSELL:
She shouldn't have been
going anywhere.

00:26:39,227 --> 00:26:40,628
Her laptop's locked.

00:26:40,628 --> 00:26:43,297
Any idea what
the password might be?

00:26:43,297 --> 00:26:45,166
Um... bloodgirl.

00:26:47,301 --> 00:26:49,237
Nope.

00:26:49,237 --> 00:26:51,339
Bloodgirl528?

00:26:53,274 --> 00:26:54,442
No, sir.
No.

00:26:54,442 --> 00:26:55,476
Oh, I know, I know--uh...

00:26:55,476 --> 00:26:58,179
Try "Agnes."

00:26:58,179 --> 00:26:59,714
Agnes? Who's that?

00:26:59,714 --> 00:27:02,483
Crazy aunt she loved.

00:27:02,483 --> 00:27:03,718
(Stokes laughs)

00:27:03,718 --> 00:27:06,354
Worked. All right.

00:27:06,354 --> 00:27:09,390
So, according
to her Web history,

00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:13,227
she was looking for fresh
bodies of water in the area.

00:27:13,227 --> 00:27:14,462
Did she find any?

00:27:14,462 --> 00:27:15,796
No, not according to this.

00:27:15,796 --> 00:27:18,332
She wrote the name "Gary"
next to an ad

00:27:18,332 --> 00:27:21,435
for the Diamond Cactus
Bar &amp; Grill.

00:27:21,435 --> 00:27:23,137
That's the bar they were at
Friday night.

00:27:23,137 --> 00:27:25,473
Give them
a little call here.

00:27:25,473 --> 00:27:26,741
Uh, hey, there.

00:27:26,741 --> 00:27:29,310
Um... is Gary around?

00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:31,579
He's on his break?

00:27:31,579 --> 00:27:34,315
Okay. Thank you.

00:27:34,315 --> 00:27:35,683
He's the bartender.

00:27:35,683 --> 00:27:38,686
If I was looking
for information around town,

00:27:38,686 --> 00:27:40,488
that'd be the first place
I'd start.

00:27:40,488 --> 00:27:42,256
Yeah, let's go talk to him.

00:27:43,824 --> 00:27:46,527
Did CSI Finlay ask you anything
about bodies of water?

00:27:46,527 --> 00:27:48,329
GARY:
Yeah.

00:27:48,329 --> 00:27:50,731
She wanted to know if there were
any lakes or streams nearby

00:27:50,731 --> 00:27:52,500
that weren't on a map.

00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,503
Only thing I could think of
was Stone Rock Lake.

00:27:55,503 --> 00:27:56,671
Is that a
man-made lake?

00:27:56,671 --> 00:27:58,239
Just a hole
in the ground now.

00:27:58,239 --> 00:27:59,540
It dried up years ago.

00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,175
You know,
the algae would still be there.

00:28:01,175 --> 00:28:02,710
How far away is this place?

00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:05,413
About 30 miles from here in the
old Stone Rock Lake campground.

00:28:05,413 --> 00:28:06,614
Just off Stevenson Highway.

00:28:06,614 --> 00:28:08,649
Thanks, Gary.

00:28:08,649 --> 00:28:10,418
(sighs)

00:28:10,418 --> 00:28:11,919
What do you think?

00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:13,487
I'd hate to go running off
in the wrong direction.

00:28:13,487 --> 00:28:15,790
Well, I think that
an abandoned campground

00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:18,893
would be a great place for
Darryl to hold women hostage.

00:28:18,893 --> 00:28:21,662
Be a good place for him
to hide out, too.

00:28:21,662 --> 00:28:23,831
Finn's got a two-hour
head start on us.

00:28:23,831 --> 00:28:26,500
Let's go find her
before she finds him.

00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,402
So how'd you end up
in a nasty gunfight?

00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:32,673
Deputy Willis said
that he got a tip

00:28:32,673 --> 00:28:34,375
that Darryl's car
had been spotted

00:28:34,375 --> 00:28:36,744
on the side of the road,
just off the interstate.

00:28:36,744 --> 00:28:39,647
So... I went with the sheriff
to check it out.

00:28:39,647 --> 00:28:41,582
(sirens wailing)

00:28:49,256 --> 00:28:50,825
(sirens stop)

00:28:52,893 --> 00:28:54,395
Darryl!

00:28:54,395 --> 00:28:55,696
It's Owen!

00:28:55,696 --> 00:28:57,431
Get out of the vehicle!

00:28:57,431 --> 00:28:58,766
We're armed, Darryl!

00:28:58,766 --> 00:29:01,402
Come on, show us your hands!

00:29:16,417 --> 00:29:17,918
He's not here.

00:29:19,587 --> 00:29:22,490
Is that bus stop still active?

00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:24,392
Yes, it is.

00:29:24,392 --> 00:29:26,160
SIDLE:
Where does it go?

00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,329
Reno. But from there,
he could've hopped a plane.

00:29:28,329 --> 00:29:30,197
(phone ringing)
He could be
anywhere by now.

00:29:30,197 --> 00:29:31,599
Get on the radio
and find out

00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:33,334
when the last
bus came through here.

00:29:33,334 --> 00:29:35,369
Hey, Henry, what's up?

00:29:36,704 --> 00:29:38,672
Are you sure?

00:29:38,672 --> 00:29:41,242
Okay. Thanks.

00:29:41,242 --> 00:29:44,845
I need a bus schedule from
Larkston to Reno, please.

00:29:50,551 --> 00:29:51,652
What the hell are you doing?

00:29:51,652 --> 00:29:52,787
Drop your weapons.

00:29:59,727 --> 00:30:02,463
Sheriff, step away
from Deputy Willis.

00:30:02,463 --> 00:30:04,331
Sheriff...
I'm not going anywhere

00:30:04,331 --> 00:30:06,333
until you tell me what
the hell's going on.

00:30:06,333 --> 00:30:07,802
Got DNA results
on semen recovered

00:30:07,802 --> 00:30:09,270
from the woman's body
in the barn.

00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:11,238
There were two male
contributors.

00:30:11,238 --> 00:30:13,240
You telling me there
was two men involved
in that woman's death?

00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:16,277
Darryl Walsh
and Deputy Simon Willis.

00:30:16,277 --> 00:30:18,179
What? That's crazy.

00:30:18,179 --> 00:30:19,680
Ms. Sidle, there's got to
be some kind of mistake.

00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,916
My colleague compared
the samples of the DNA

00:30:21,916 --> 00:30:25,519
that I got off of you and your
deputies at the crime scene.

00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:27,188
No mistake.

00:30:27,188 --> 00:30:29,390
Simon...

00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:31,258
did you have anything to do
with that woman's death?

00:30:31,258 --> 00:30:33,494
No. Owen, come on,
you know me.

00:30:39,633 --> 00:30:41,769
Why don't you...

00:30:41,769 --> 00:30:45,372
why don't you put
the gun down,

00:30:45,372 --> 00:30:47,208
we'll talk about it.

00:30:50,544 --> 00:30:52,446
Okay.

00:31:02,223 --> 00:31:04,892
BRASS: <i>You're lucky</i>
<i>it was just a graze.</i>

00:31:04,892 --> 00:31:06,727
Yeah.

00:31:06,727 --> 00:31:08,429
I managed to get
a call through to Morgan

00:31:08,429 --> 00:31:10,431
and...

00:31:10,431 --> 00:31:12,399
shortly after that,
help arrived.

00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:15,269
You know, you saved
Sheriff Gardner's life.

00:31:15,269 --> 00:31:17,705
I got a message that
he's out of surgery.

00:31:17,705 --> 00:31:20,674
His version of the
facts matches yours.

00:31:20,674 --> 00:31:22,176
So, we're done?

00:31:22,176 --> 00:31:23,511
I'll just file a
report with the IAB,

00:31:23,511 --> 00:31:24,845
they'll make their
determination,

00:31:24,845 --> 00:31:26,514
but I wouldn't sweat it.

00:31:27,615 --> 00:31:29,617
Thank you for coming.

00:31:29,617 --> 00:31:31,919
You're welcome.
Of course.

00:31:34,822 --> 00:31:36,390
Oh, hey, Sara?

00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:37,858
Yeah?

00:31:37,858 --> 00:31:39,326
Let me know
when you hear about Finn.

00:31:39,326 --> 00:31:41,195
I will.

00:31:55,476 --> 00:31:56,610
(Stokes cocks gun)

00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:10,891
RUSSELL:
Plate's a match.

00:32:10,891 --> 00:32:13,260
That's Deputy Lennox's car,

00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,595
so Finn's got to be
around here.

00:32:15,663 --> 00:32:17,364
The keys are in it.

00:32:17,364 --> 00:32:19,366
She must've had car trouble.

00:32:25,439 --> 00:32:27,308
Hey...

00:32:27,308 --> 00:32:29,143
coil wires have been cut.

00:32:29,143 --> 00:32:32,913
Darryl wanted to make sure
she couldn't leave.

00:32:32,913 --> 00:32:34,481
(closes hood)

00:32:34,481 --> 00:32:36,483
Nick... I got blood in the car.

00:32:36,483 --> 00:32:37,851
Okay.

00:32:37,851 --> 00:32:39,186
Let's go.

00:32:51,532 --> 00:32:54,134
(whispers):
Take the right.

00:32:59,473 --> 00:33:00,574
Finn?

00:33:00,574 --> 00:33:02,476
I got a body
over here, man.

00:33:10,718 --> 00:33:12,253
It's Darryl Walsh.

00:33:12,253 --> 00:33:13,654
Shot in the chest.

00:33:16,423 --> 00:33:18,425
He's dead as a doornail.

00:33:18,425 --> 00:33:20,561
All right, so...

00:33:20,561 --> 00:33:23,864
Finn's not dead,
then where the hell is she?

00:33:23,864 --> 00:33:25,899
Obviously,
this is where...

00:33:25,899 --> 00:33:28,902
he kept the girls.

00:33:28,902 --> 00:33:31,171
Yeah.

00:33:31,171 --> 00:33:33,307
So what do we got here?

00:33:41,348 --> 00:33:44,285
(exhales)
Got a fully loaded rape kit.

00:33:46,453 --> 00:33:48,188
STOKES:
Three shells.

00:33:51,625 --> 00:33:53,527
.380 casing--
same as Finn.

00:34:00,367 --> 00:34:01,368
(beeps)

00:34:01,368 --> 00:34:03,737
It's her cell phone.

00:34:05,572 --> 00:34:07,808
All right, let-let's
figure this out.

00:34:11,278 --> 00:34:13,147
STOKES:
Well, for starters,

00:34:13,147 --> 00:34:15,716
we got an ax handle
with blood all over it.

00:34:15,716 --> 00:34:17,318
RUSSELL:
Rape kit's open.

00:34:17,318 --> 00:34:18,585
Her cell phone's
right next to it,

00:34:18,585 --> 00:34:20,154
so maybe she was trying

00:34:20,154 --> 00:34:22,289
to document the
crime scene, right?

00:34:22,289 --> 00:34:24,892
Yeah, he disables her car,
he grabs the handle

00:34:24,892 --> 00:34:28,896
on his way back inside,
and just... ambushes her.

00:34:35,669 --> 00:34:37,771
And that would
have pissed her off.

00:34:37,771 --> 00:34:40,341
Yeah, yeah.
She fought back, for sure.

00:34:40,341 --> 00:34:43,744
(Finlay grunting, gasping)

00:34:43,744 --> 00:34:45,279
(punch thuds)

00:34:45,279 --> 00:34:47,614
(Finlay shouting)

00:34:47,614 --> 00:34:49,283
(grunts)

00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,190
And there's two bullets
in the wall right here.

00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:58,525
So she gets off
three shots--

00:34:58,525 --> 00:35:01,462
two miss, but that
third one, boy...

00:35:02,529 --> 00:35:03,697

Blood pool is still liquid
around the edges, so...

00:35:10,504 --> 00:35:12,606
this couldn't have
happened too long ago.

00:35:12,606 --> 00:35:15,309
Car's dead;
she's got to be on foot.

00:35:15,309 --> 00:35:16,844
After she makes it
through this mess,

00:35:16,844 --> 00:35:18,712
she probably made a beeline
for the road.

00:35:18,712 --> 00:35:20,848
I need you to stay here
and process this scene.

00:35:20,848 --> 00:35:22,549
Finn shot the guy.

00:35:22,549 --> 00:35:24,451
We need to do this right.

00:35:24,451 --> 00:35:25,886
I'll go look for her.

00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:16,924
I-I saw this guy on one of
those antique car shows.

00:38:16,924 --> 00:38:18,825
He had this old car,
he drove it for years,

00:38:18,825 --> 00:38:20,594
and when he hit
a million miles,

00:38:20,594 --> 00:38:23,764
he got an emblem to put
on the grill of his car.

00:38:27,301 --> 00:38:29,136
BRODY:
"Million Mile Club."

00:38:29,136 --> 00:38:30,237
MMC.

00:38:30,237 --> 00:38:31,738
It's very exclusive.

00:38:34,374 --> 00:38:37,210
And the town of Larkston
has one member.

00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:52,159
Hey, Doc.

00:38:53,226 --> 00:38:54,294
(sighs)

00:38:54,294 --> 00:38:56,196
Mind if I join you?

00:38:57,631 --> 00:38:59,433
(nervous chuckle)
Wh-What's this about?

00:38:59,433 --> 00:39:02,836
Well, I saw your car
parked out front.

00:39:02,836 --> 00:39:04,905
Looks like it's...

00:39:04,905 --> 00:39:06,807
been in an accident.

00:39:06,807 --> 00:39:09,476
Now, that'd be a real shame--
you've been driving that car

00:39:09,476 --> 00:39:10,777
for a long time.

00:39:10,777 --> 00:39:12,846
You got over a million
miles on it.

00:39:12,846 --> 00:39:14,848
You even have that
cool grill badge

00:39:14,848 --> 00:39:16,383
to prove it.

00:39:16,383 --> 00:39:17,884
Love that thing.

00:39:17,884 --> 00:39:21,521
It also made quite an
impression on my friend...

00:39:21,521 --> 00:39:24,224
when you hit her
with your car.

00:39:24,224 --> 00:39:26,259
(engine revving,
tires screeching)

00:39:26,259 --> 00:39:29,830
(thudding)

00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:31,198
It was an accident.

00:39:31,198 --> 00:39:33,200
No, it wasn't.

00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,403
You tried to kill CSI Finlay
to protect your nasty secret.

00:39:36,403 --> 00:39:38,572
What nasty secret?

00:39:38,572 --> 00:39:40,207
That you're a part
of Deputy Willis

00:39:40,207 --> 00:39:41,775
and Darryl Walsh's
little rape club.

00:39:41,775 --> 00:39:43,810
That's not true.

00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:46,713
I found evidence you were in
the cabin in Stone Rock Lake.

00:39:46,713 --> 00:39:49,883
I was only there
to stitch up Darryl

00:39:49,883 --> 00:39:51,852
after CSI Finlay stabbed him.

00:39:51,852 --> 00:39:53,487
Deputy Willis forced me.

00:39:53,487 --> 00:39:56,523
Did he also force you to
rape Brenda Whittaker?

00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:02,362
Come on. I'm a CSI, man,
and a pretty good one.

00:40:02,362 --> 00:40:05,399
You don't think I'm gonna find
your dirty, nasty used condoms

00:40:05,399 --> 00:40:06,867
in the trash can out front?

00:40:06,867 --> 00:40:08,669
DNA was all over them.

00:40:08,669 --> 00:40:10,604
(laughs anxiously)

00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:16,376
So, I had sex with her.

00:40:17,711 --> 00:40:20,447
No. You raped her.

00:40:20,447 --> 00:40:22,416
And tying a woman up

00:40:22,416 --> 00:40:24,317
against her will, for months,

00:40:24,317 --> 00:40:28,588
and raping her over and
over and over again,

00:40:28,588 --> 00:40:31,158
and then, you bash her
head in with a hammer,

00:40:31,158 --> 00:40:34,194
and you dump her body
in the hood of her car--

00:40:34,194 --> 00:40:36,730
mm--I don't think I need
to tell you what that is.

00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:39,599
I had nothing to do
with her death.

00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:42,335
That was all Darryl
and-and Deputy Willis.

00:40:42,335 --> 00:40:43,904
Well, they're gone.

00:40:43,904 --> 00:40:46,740
You're the one left
holding the bag now.

00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:51,712
So, I know there are at least
two other women missing.

00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:53,714
Where are their bodies?

00:40:53,714 --> 00:40:56,283
I don't know. I...

00:40:56,283 --> 00:40:58,418
Darryl said
they took care of them.

00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:05,192
All I did was have sex
with those girls.

00:41:05,192 --> 00:41:07,861
I-I never did anything
to hurt them.

00:41:10,163 --> 00:41:12,265
What do you think rape is?

00:41:12,265 --> 00:41:14,634
Hmm?

00:41:14,634 --> 00:41:17,170
You're a sick man, Dr. Kinney.

00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:19,639
You need some help.

00:41:19,639 --> 00:41:22,409
And now you're under arrest.

00:41:24,911 --> 00:41:26,780
LENNOX:
You heard the man.

00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:30,517
Come on, let's go.

00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:39,426
(monitor beeping steadily)

00:41:39,426 --> 00:41:40,427
Oh... (laughs)

00:41:40,427 --> 00:41:41,695
RUSSELL:
How you doing?

00:41:41,695 --> 00:41:43,663
You all right?
Want some more drugs?

00:41:43,663 --> 00:41:45,298
I do like the ones I'm on.

00:41:45,298 --> 00:41:46,733
(laughs)

00:41:48,602 --> 00:41:53,173
Thought we almost lost you
there for a minute, Jules.

00:41:53,173 --> 00:41:55,709
I already started
interviewing replacements.

00:41:55,709 --> 00:41:58,645
Yeah? You think you can
get rid of me that easily?

00:41:58,645 --> 00:42:00,247
We could always hope.

00:42:00,247 --> 00:42:01,548
SIDLE:
Up for more visitors?

00:42:02,649 --> 00:42:04,184
Hi.

00:42:04,184 --> 00:42:05,519
RUSSELL:
I'll call you tomorrow.

00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:07,621
Okay.

00:42:07,621 --> 00:42:09,256
So, we never made it
to the spa.

00:42:09,256 --> 00:42:10,924
Thought we'd bring it to you.

00:42:10,924 --> 00:42:12,492
Thank you.

00:42:12,492 --> 00:42:14,795
So what do you want
to do next weekend?
