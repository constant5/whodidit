We're gonna put you
upstairs in a suite on us.

clean up,

00:02:23,638 --> 00:02:25,606
and then come back down here
in a few hours

00:02:25,606 --> 00:02:27,542
and take us
for everything we got.

00:02:27,542 --> 00:02:28,843
How does that sound?

I'm sorry?
It's 8:00 a.m.,

00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,242
as in the graveyard shift
ended two hours ago.

00:03:01,242 --> 00:03:02,977
You realize that, right?

00:03:02,977 --> 00:03:06,080
This body
is, is mine.

00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,883
I'm not going to get into
a turf war with you right now.

00:03:08,883 --> 00:03:11,285
Because you'll lose.

00:03:11,285 --> 00:03:14,088
Look, don't make me
call your supervisor.

Oh, Yeager.

00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:23,998
Yeah, your supervisor
speaks very highly of you.

00:03:23,998 --> 00:03:25,766
You're a CSI-2, right?

00:03:25,766 --> 00:03:27,268
Yeah, one solve away

00:03:27,268 --> 00:03:28,970
from a promotion?

00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:30,938
Yes, sir.
You know, I-I never
cared much for this

00:03:30,938 --> 00:03:33,107
day shift
versus night shift crap.

00:03:33,107 --> 00:03:36,711
I mean, we're all
one crime lab, right?

00:03:36,711 --> 00:03:38,246
All for one, one for all.

00:03:38,246 --> 00:03:42,216
Okay, look, cards
on the table here.

00:03:42,216 --> 00:03:44,952
I really do need this
solve to be a solo.

00:03:44,952 --> 00:03:47,054
I hate to break it to you,

00:03:47,054 --> 00:03:48,890
Yeager, but I don't think
this is the game-changer

00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:50,892
that you're looking for.

00:03:50,892 --> 00:03:53,127
Homeless guy assaulted
in an alley.
(phone chirping)

00:03:53,127 --> 00:03:54,128

00:03:54,128 --> 00:03:55,529
Yeah?

00:03:55,529 --> 00:03:57,598
I'm not so sure
about that.

00:03:57,598 --> 00:03:58,633
Yeah, I think I'm with you.

00:03:58,633 --> 00:03:59,834
Why, do you got something?

00:03:59,834 --> 00:04:01,235
Uh, my wife Barbara

00:04:01,235 --> 00:04:02,603
is stranded at
the airport,

00:04:02,603 --> 00:04:04,038
needs a lift.

00:04:04,038 --> 00:04:05,907
So you should go
pick her up.

00:04:05,907 --> 00:04:07,241

of this.

Don't you think?

I think he just

00:05:01,595 --> 00:05:03,197
may have really
needed a shower.

BRODY:
He's got dirty clothes,

00:05:04,632 --> 00:05:06,300
got weathered skin.

00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,803
He's been living on the streets
for quite a while, you can tell.

00:05:08,803 --> 00:05:10,071
You get a wallet, David?

00:05:10,071 --> 00:05:11,238
No wallet--
I checked.

00:05:11,238 --> 00:05:12,773
PHILLIPS:
Yeager,

00:05:12,773 --> 00:05:14,308
come on, man,
you know the protocol.

00:05:14,308 --> 00:05:16,711
You can't touch my body
without my authorization.

00:05:16,711 --> 00:05:18,179
I didn't touch your body.

00:05:18,179 --> 00:05:20,548
I saw a wear pattern
on the back pocket with no lump.

00:05:20,548 --> 00:05:22,283
No lump,
no wallet.

00:05:22,283 --> 00:05:24,251
I figure the guy gets mugged,
the attacker rifles

00:05:24,251 --> 00:05:25,853
through the wallet and tosses it

00:05:25,853 --> 00:05:27,188
in the nearest
trash receptacle.

00:05:27,188 --> 00:05:28,723
Hey, I'm not in
here for my health.

00:05:28,723 --> 00:05:29,991
You've been in there
for a while.

00:05:29,991 --> 00:05:31,125
You found a wallet yet?

00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:32,159
I'm working on it.

00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:33,160
PHILLIPS:
Hey, uh,

00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,529
liver temp was 91.1,

00:05:35,529 --> 00:05:38,866
which puts time of death at
around 3:00 this morning.

00:05:38,866 --> 00:05:43,037
I count 12 sharp-force injuries
with a two-inch blade.

00:05:43,037 --> 00:05:44,939
Stabbed in the back.

00:05:44,939 --> 00:05:45,940
I know how he feels.

00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,308
You know what?

00:05:47,308 --> 00:05:48,909
When we close this case,
you can have the solve.

00:05:48,909 --> 00:05:50,077
Thanks,

00:05:50,077 --> 00:05:52,146
but I don't need your charity.

00:05:52,146 --> 00:05:54,648
Case...

00:05:54,648 --> 00:05:56,183
in point.

00:05:56,183 --> 00:05:58,285
Blood says it's related.

00:05:59,653 --> 00:06:01,288
Empty.

00:06:01,288 --> 00:06:03,758
What is homeless
guy doing with

00:06:03,758 --> 00:06:05,059
the <i>Mission: Impossible</i>
briefcase?

00:06:06,961 --> 00:06:08,662
So much for your trash run.

00:06:15,903 --> 00:06:17,538
Got blood drops.

00:06:17,538 --> 00:06:20,541
Looks like the assault
started right here.

00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:22,009
<i>Our victim is heading</i>
<i>down the alley,</i>

00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:23,577
<i>he gets attacked from behind.</i>

00:06:23,577 --> 00:06:25,146
<i>The assailant grabs</i>
<i>the briefcase,</i>

00:06:25,146 --> 00:06:26,647
<i>steals what's inside.</i>

00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:31,152
But these blood smears

00:06:31,152 --> 00:06:33,854
and drag marks say
that it didn't end there.

00:06:33,854 --> 00:06:36,090
<i>The killer sees his victim</i>

00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:38,793
<i>still alive,</i>
<i>trying to crawl away,</i>

00:06:38,793 --> 00:06:41,595
<i>so he drags him out of sight,</i>
<i>finishes him off.</i>

00:06:41,595 --> 00:06:43,030
You know,

00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:46,000
you see that blood on his finger
and under his hand?

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,135
Weird, right?

00:06:48,135 --> 00:06:49,970
D.E.

00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:52,206
What do you suppose
that means?

00:06:52,206 --> 00:06:55,176
Well, maybe it's a,
a message, you know,

00:06:55,176 --> 00:06:56,911
last words to
a loved one.

00:06:56,911 --> 00:06:58,646
Or, if it were me,

00:06:58,646 --> 00:07:00,214
my dying breath,

00:07:00,214 --> 00:07:03,617
I'd try to identify
my killer.

00:07:03,617 --> 00:07:05,186
I see you're not the
sentimental type.

00:07:05,186 --> 00:07:07,188
Okay, I like that.

00:07:09,056 --> 00:07:10,858
RUSSELL:
<i>Oh, boy, honey, I'm so sorry.</i>

00:07:10,858 --> 00:07:13,627
Problem solved.

00:07:13,627 --> 00:07:15,729
Conrad wanted me to
reschedule a hearing.

00:07:15,729 --> 00:07:18,866
It's okay, I get it, I know
you're a very busy person.

00:07:18,866 --> 00:07:21,035
That's why I said I would take
a taxi from the airport.

00:07:21,035 --> 00:07:22,903
No, no, I told you I wanted
to take you home.

00:07:22,903 --> 00:07:24,805
I'm gonna, I'm gonna
take you home.

00:07:24,805 --> 00:07:26,240
Sit first.
Have something to eat.

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,175
These pastries are good.
Pastry?

00:07:28,175 --> 00:07:32,546
No, I-- ah, I'm sorry, I
can't-- couldn't possibly...

00:07:32,546 --> 00:07:34,281
I will-- let me have a hit
of that coffee, though.

00:07:34,281 --> 00:07:35,583
Thanks.

00:07:37,084 --> 00:07:38,586
Hey.

00:07:38,586 --> 00:07:41,722
I'm sorry, really, I...

00:07:41,722 --> 00:07:42,923
How are you?

00:07:42,923 --> 00:07:44,191
How was Seattle?

00:07:44,191 --> 00:07:46,060
Maya and Katie
are both doing very well,

00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,828
and Ryan talked
with his company

00:07:47,828 --> 00:07:49,663
and worked it out
so he can stay home more.

00:07:49,663 --> 00:07:51,265
That's good.

00:07:51,265 --> 00:07:53,100
(phone beeps)

00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,736
Have you talked
to Charlie?

00:07:55,736 --> 00:07:56,837
It's been crazy around here.

00:07:56,837 --> 00:07:58,005
I-I know I got

00:07:58,005 --> 00:07:59,940
a couple of
messages from him.

00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,609
Is there something
I should know?
Well, there's something

00:08:01,609 --> 00:08:03,244
he would like
to tell you himself.

00:08:03,244 --> 00:08:05,179
Oh, come on, come on,
that's not fair.

00:08:05,179 --> 00:08:06,547
I promise I'll
act surprised.

00:08:06,547 --> 00:08:07,882
What? What?

00:08:07,882 --> 00:08:10,885
He's gotten an offer
from Eastern Indiana--

00:08:10,885 --> 00:08:13,120
full scholarship,
starting point guard.

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,923
Is he gonna take it?

00:08:15,923 --> 00:08:17,791
Well, I think so.

00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:22,263
Well, that is news.

00:08:22,263 --> 00:08:24,732
It's great, it-it's just
that, you know...

00:08:24,732 --> 00:08:29,069
one of the reasons why we took
this job was so we could be,

00:08:29,069 --> 00:08:32,673
you know, near Charlie,
watch him play his games.

00:08:32,673 --> 00:08:35,609
I think getting away
could be good for him.

00:08:35,609 --> 00:08:36,677
I know.

00:08:36,677 --> 00:08:39,079
I know.

00:08:39,079 --> 00:08:41,315
I just didn't expect it,
that's all.

00:08:41,315 --> 00:08:44,185
Things change,
plans change.

00:08:46,253 --> 00:08:49,123
That sounds like another
discussion we need to have.

00:08:49,123 --> 00:08:51,959
Yeah, but at another time.

00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:53,694
I can tell you're busy,
sweetheart,

00:08:53,694 --> 00:08:55,596
and I can take a taxi.

00:09:02,136 --> 00:09:03,971
Hey, Doc, got
your message.

00:09:03,971 --> 00:09:05,606
You have something for me?

00:09:05,606 --> 00:09:08,842
Yeah, still working
on our alley John Doe,

00:09:08,842 --> 00:09:10,978
but I found this
in one of the wound tracks.

00:09:10,978 --> 00:09:12,813
Maybe a piece
of the murder weapon.

00:09:12,813 --> 00:09:15,216
Tip of the blade--
maybe it broke off.

00:09:15,216 --> 00:09:16,917
I'll get it to Hodges.

00:09:16,917 --> 00:09:19,119
Tell me something--
these wound patterns...

00:09:19,119 --> 00:09:21,755
I admit sometimes cases
start to blur together,

00:09:21,755 --> 00:09:24,825
but I could swear I have seen
this somewhere before.

00:09:24,825 --> 00:09:26,694
Well, the two wounds
in the center,

00:09:26,694 --> 00:09:28,062
closest to the
spine, appear

00:09:28,062 --> 00:09:29,730
deeper and wider.

00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:31,765
Almost like the killer
twisted the blade.

00:09:31,765 --> 00:09:35,135
Yeah, but the rest of the
wounds are clean, sharp.

00:09:35,135 --> 00:09:37,171
That could be overkill, rage.

00:09:37,171 --> 00:09:40,541
Or something else--
a signature.

00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:42,843
I'll pull some case files,
see what I can find.

00:09:42,843 --> 00:09:44,812
Thanks.

Well, that wasn't the question.

Wow.

00:11:53,907 --> 00:11:54,908
You remembered all that?

00:11:56,243 --> 00:11:58,579
Can you remember his name?

200 bucks for a Farami watch

you're, uh,

Uh, yeah, sure.

You never know.
Oh, and the watch and the ring.

00:12:25,873 --> 00:12:28,075
You guys still have those,
right?

00:12:28,075 --> 00:12:30,277
Yeah. We got 'em.

00:12:30,277 --> 00:12:32,246
Great. We'll take those to go.

Wow, somebody had a good night.

FINLAY
Yep, that's Jeremy Sikes
from last night

00:12:39,052 --> 00:12:42,122
from the eye-in-the-sky
from Pike's Gambling Hall.

00:12:42,122 --> 00:12:44,992
This was distributed to security
at all the casinos in town

00:12:44,992 --> 00:12:46,994
with a warning to keep

00:12:46,994 --> 00:12:49,096
a lookout for this guy.
RUSSELL:
Why?

00:12:49,096 --> 00:12:50,130
Was he causing trouble?

00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:51,532
Oh, the worst kind.

00:12:51,532 --> 00:12:52,533
At least in Vegas.

00:12:52,533 --> 00:12:53,867
Our friend here

00:12:53,867 --> 00:12:55,836
took his $200
from Ruby's Pawn Shop,

00:12:55,836 --> 00:12:58,205
walked into Pike's
and 37 hands,

00:12:58,205 --> 00:13:01,875
45 minutes later,
he had $350,000.

00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:03,110
Wow.

00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,978
Well, at least we know

00:13:04,978 --> 00:13:06,613
why he had
that briefcase.

00:13:06,613 --> 00:13:09,550
$200 turning into 350 grand--

00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,251
come on, what are
the odds of that?

00:13:11,251 --> 00:13:13,687
I'd say somewhere in the range
of being eaten by a shark

00:13:13,687 --> 00:13:15,289
while being struck
by lightning.

00:13:15,289 --> 00:13:17,191
(chuckles):
Yeah...
The casino, obviously,

00:13:17,191 --> 00:13:18,292
thought that he was cheating.

00:13:18,292 --> 00:13:19,693
Card counting?

00:13:19,693 --> 00:13:21,195
No, the betting pattern
was off.

00:13:21,195 --> 00:13:24,031
They suspected collusion
with his dealer, Kristi Holt,

00:13:24,031 --> 00:13:27,201
who, by the way, did not show up
for work this morning.

00:13:27,201 --> 00:13:29,670
RUSSELL: You're thinking
that Sikes and Holt

00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,271
were scamming the casino.

00:13:31,271 --> 00:13:33,607
And then Holt stabbed Sikes
in the back-- literally--

00:13:33,607 --> 00:13:34,942
and ran off with the money.

00:13:34,942 --> 00:13:36,944
Interesting theory, but...

00:13:36,944 --> 00:13:38,011
(tapping keys)

00:13:38,011 --> 00:13:39,746
RUSSELL:
Look at that--

00:13:39,746 --> 00:13:41,615
Sikes drew quite the crowd.
Any one of them could've

00:13:41,615 --> 00:13:43,016
followed him back
into the alley, right?

00:13:43,016 --> 00:13:44,818
FINLAY: My money's
still on the dealer.

00:13:44,818 --> 00:13:46,620
That's because you're assuming
that they were cheating.

00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,988
Of course they cheated.

00:13:47,988 --> 00:13:50,791
No, and Sikes even tried
to I.D. his killer

00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:51,892
in his own blood:

00:13:51,892 --> 00:13:54,862
"D-E" spells "Dealer" to me.

00:13:54,862 --> 00:13:56,830
Look, for all we know,
this is just one of those

00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:57,965
great Vegas stories:

00:13:57,965 --> 00:14:01,101
Guy pawns
his last possessions,

00:14:01,101 --> 00:14:02,636
nets it all and wins.

00:14:02,636 --> 00:14:04,838
The two of them
are total strangers

00:14:04,838 --> 00:14:06,740
and it's just a case
of dumb luck.

00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,841
I don't believe in luck.

00:14:07,841 --> 00:14:08,942
Me, neither.

00:14:08,942 --> 00:14:11,144
Why? What do you got?

00:14:11,144 --> 00:14:13,146
A connection...
between Jeremy Sikes

00:14:13,146 --> 00:14:15,883
and our dealer Kristi Holt.

00:14:15,883 --> 00:14:18,719
The watch that Sikes
pawned for stake money

00:14:18,719 --> 00:14:21,655
turned out to belong
to Kristi's husband.

00:14:21,655 --> 00:14:23,190
And here's the kicker:

00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:24,892
Her husband was
murdered two months ago.

00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:29,162
Dumb luck, huh?

00:14:29,162 --> 00:14:31,665
I'm thinking that maybe
this casino heist

00:14:31,665 --> 00:14:33,700
isn't the first time that
Kristi enlisted Sikes

00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,937
to engage in
a little dirty work.

00:14:36,937 --> 00:14:40,240
Two months ago, she has
him murder her husband.

00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,776
And, last night, after
they both scammed the casino,

00:14:42,776 --> 00:14:45,946
Kristi kills Sikes.

00:14:45,946 --> 00:14:48,549
So it looks like
we have this Kristi Holt

00:14:48,549 --> 00:14:49,783
dealing the death card--

00:14:49,783 --> 00:14:51,552
not just once,
but twice.

00:14:56,957 --> 00:14:58,959
Yeager and I pulled
the cold case file

00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,329
on the murder of Simon Holt,
our blackjack dealer's husband.

00:15:02,329 --> 00:15:04,565
You and Yeager.

00:15:04,565 --> 00:15:06,266
Nice to see you kids
getting along.

00:15:06,266 --> 00:15:07,701
Yeah, well,
let's just be clear:

00:15:07,701 --> 00:15:08,869
I'm Rizzoli
and she's Isles.

00:15:08,869 --> 00:15:10,070
(laughing):
Yeah.

00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:13,106
Anyway, the case is
still open.

00:15:13,106 --> 00:15:16,209
And maybe open because
day shift was investigating.

00:15:16,209 --> 00:15:18,245
Don't look at me, okay?
I was on the swing shift then.

00:15:18,245 --> 00:15:20,881
The night of the murder,
Kristi Holt was questioned.

00:15:20,881 --> 00:15:23,817
She said she finished up
her shift at Pike's

00:15:23,817 --> 00:15:26,687
<i>then left the casino to meet up</i>
<i>with her husband Simon.</i>

00:15:26,687 --> 00:15:28,956
They met for dinner,
then got home around midnight.

00:15:28,956 --> 00:15:30,290
She was really tired.

00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:31,992
Immediately went
upstairs to bed,

00:15:31,992 --> 00:15:33,827
and he went to the living room
to watch the news.

00:15:33,827 --> 00:15:35,662
YEAGER: And that's when
she heard two shots ring out.

00:15:35,662 --> 00:15:37,197
She ran downstairs
and found her husband dead

00:15:37,197 --> 00:15:38,732
and the place was ransacked.

00:15:38,732 --> 00:15:40,233
So Kristi Holt's story is that

00:15:40,233 --> 00:15:43,904
her husband walked in on
some guy robbing the place.

00:15:43,904 --> 00:15:45,939
Now, in defense of day shift,
it was a good story.

00:15:45,939 --> 00:15:47,307
There was no reason
to doubt it.

00:15:47,307 --> 00:15:48,942
Until last night...

00:15:48,942 --> 00:15:50,978
<i>when Jeremy Sikes</i>
<i>turned up dead.</i>

00:15:50,978 --> 00:15:54,181
After pawning Kristi Holt's
husband's watch,

00:15:54,181 --> 00:15:56,049
and going on
one hell of a run

00:15:56,049 --> 00:15:57,985
at her blackjack table.

00:15:57,985 --> 00:16:00,887
They say there are
no coincidences.

00:16:00,887 --> 00:16:03,590
Yeah, but...
sometimes there are.

00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:04,858
Yeah. Right.

00:16:04,858 --> 00:16:06,627
Dumb luck.

00:16:06,627 --> 00:16:10,230
I thought we agreed that
luck wasn't a player in this.

00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:11,965
All right, well, then,
call it destiny.

00:16:11,965 --> 00:16:13,634
Or fate.
BRODY: Of all of the

00:16:13,634 --> 00:16:15,068
blackjack tables
in all of the world--

00:16:15,068 --> 00:16:16,570
is that where
you're going with this?

00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:17,904
No, where I'm going with this

00:16:17,904 --> 00:16:19,006
is there's one person
still alive

00:16:19,006 --> 00:16:20,140
who can answer these questions.

00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,576
(phone chimes)
BRODY: Mm.

00:16:22,576 --> 00:16:23,877
What, is that your wife again?

00:16:23,877 --> 00:16:25,312
No, someone else's.

00:16:25,312 --> 00:16:28,081
A widow, as a matter of fact.

00:16:28,081 --> 00:16:30,851
Brass just
picked up Kristi Holt.

00:16:30,851 --> 00:16:33,020
If this is about what
happened last night,

00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:35,622
I'll tell you what
I told Bobby, my pit boss:

00:16:35,622 --> 00:16:37,324
It was a straight-up run.

00:16:37,324 --> 00:16:39,026
There was no cheat.

00:16:39,026 --> 00:16:41,294
If we're just talking about
cheating here,

00:16:41,294 --> 00:16:43,296
then this is your lucky night.

00:16:43,296 --> 00:16:44,965
Now it's my turn
to deal.

00:16:48,001 --> 00:16:49,703
Your pal Jeremy Sikes.

00:16:49,703 --> 00:16:51,905
Oh, my God, wha...
that's... the guy.

00:16:51,905 --> 00:16:53,774
I... Is he...?

00:16:53,774 --> 00:16:54,908
Dead? Yeah.

00:16:54,908 --> 00:16:56,009
But I think you know that.

00:16:57,844 --> 00:16:58,912
How about I hit you again?

00:16:58,912 --> 00:17:01,615
Your husband Simon.

00:17:01,615 --> 00:17:03,850
This is the time
in this gambling session,

00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,318
when you go bust.

00:17:05,318 --> 00:17:08,188
Or you play your ace in the hole
and tell me the truth.

00:17:08,188 --> 00:17:10,757
The truth?

00:17:10,757 --> 00:17:12,192
The truth is
my husband was murdered

00:17:12,192 --> 00:17:13,794
when he walked in on a burglary.

00:17:13,794 --> 00:17:15,662
You sure you want
to stick with that story?

00:17:15,662 --> 00:17:16,997
It's not a story.

00:17:16,997 --> 00:17:18,765
Yes, it is. And you
really ought to hang out

00:17:18,765 --> 00:17:20,300
with a better class
of co-conspirator--

00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,002
or at least a smarter one--

00:17:22,002 --> 00:17:24,671
because your pal Jeremy
pawned your husband's watch

00:17:24,671 --> 00:17:26,807
for $200 and brought
the money to the table--

00:17:26,807 --> 00:17:28,241
that's what staked him
in the game.

00:17:28,241 --> 00:17:30,944
This guy...
had Simon's watch?

00:17:30,944 --> 00:17:32,045
Yes.

00:17:32,045 --> 00:17:33,280
If he had his watch,

00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,582
it must be because he stole it

00:17:35,582 --> 00:17:39,019
because he's the one
who broke in our house.

00:17:39,019 --> 00:17:40,821
Or there could be
another explanation:

00:17:40,821 --> 00:17:42,255
You could've given it
to him as a little

00:17:42,255 --> 00:17:44,725
thank-you gift
for killing your husband.

00:17:44,725 --> 00:17:46,093
That's sick!

00:17:46,093 --> 00:17:47,994
I gave that watch to Simon
for our anniversary!

00:17:47,994 --> 00:17:49,329
Yeah.
We checked with Farami.

00:17:49,329 --> 00:17:51,198
It's a special order.

00:17:51,198 --> 00:17:52,699
Around $2,000.

00:17:52,699 --> 00:17:54,901
So I--I looked
at the insurance records,

00:17:54,901 --> 00:17:58,205
the claims and
the police statements,

00:17:58,205 --> 00:18:02,109
and... nowhere is there
mention of a $2,000 watch.

00:18:02,109 --> 00:18:04,578
My husband was murdered,
Detective.

00:18:04,578 --> 00:18:06,146
I forgot about
the damn watch!

00:18:06,146 --> 00:18:07,814
You didn't forget about
the insurance money.

00:18:07,814 --> 00:18:09,983
Which went to pay off
Simon's debts!

00:18:09,983 --> 00:18:12,285
Which is why
you and Jeremy doubled down

00:18:12,285 --> 00:18:14,988
at Pike's Gambling Hall,
to the tune of $350,000.

00:18:14,988 --> 00:18:17,557
Kristi, you know,
you didn't show up for work.

00:18:17,557 --> 00:18:19,726
You end up at a motel,
hiding under the bed...

00:18:19,726 --> 00:18:21,595
this doesn't look good.

00:18:21,595 --> 00:18:23,530
If you worked
for old-school guys

00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:25,565
at an old-school
casino like Pike's,

00:18:25,565 --> 00:18:26,967
and they thought
you cheated them...

00:18:26,967 --> 00:18:28,802
you'd be laying low
in a motel, too.

00:18:28,802 --> 00:18:33,707
And if this is the guy
who broke in my house

00:18:33,707 --> 00:18:36,143
and killed my husband,
then he deserved to die.

00:18:36,143 --> 00:18:39,112
But I didn't kill him, and I
didn't have anything to do

00:18:39,112 --> 00:18:40,881
with cheating the
casino last night,

00:18:40,881 --> 00:18:43,583
and if you don't believe me,
check the damn tape,

00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:46,253

I'm still not convinced.

00:19:37,671 --> 00:19:39,239
This guy went on
an insane run.

00:19:39,239 --> 00:19:41,107
We saw the tape.
He's hitting when he shouldn't,

00:19:41,107 --> 00:19:42,209

What about the evidence?

00:19:52,152 --> 00:19:54,988
I did examine all 416 cards
in play-- they weren't marked.

00:19:54,988 --> 00:19:56,022
And the shoe checked out.

00:19:56,022 --> 00:19:57,557

at the shuffler.

There's no sign that
either one of them

00:19:58,992 --> 00:20:00,760
was tampered with.

00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,629
And you didn't get anything
on the eye in the sky?

00:20:02,629 --> 00:20:04,898
No. If she was palming cards or
pulling some sleight of hand,

00:20:04,898 --> 00:20:06,633
she was doing it between
the video frames.

00:20:06,633 --> 00:20:08,201
Okay, so she's a magician.

00:20:08,201 --> 00:20:10,604
That doesn't mean
she's not a killer.

00:20:10,604 --> 00:20:12,606

00:20:20,013 --> 00:20:22,215
She was detained
by casino security

00:20:22,215 --> 00:20:24,084
right after she left
the blackjack table,

00:20:24,084 --> 00:20:28,555
and then was interrogated
by her pit boss Bobby Esposito.

00:20:28,555 --> 00:20:30,690
That's them in the holding room.

So Holt's inquisition
lasted over four hours.

00:20:38,598 --> 00:20:40,267
There is no way
that she killed Sikes.

00:20:40,267 --> 00:20:42,836
So who did?

00:20:42,836 --> 00:20:45,138
Well, I hate to admit it,
but Russell may be right.

00:20:45,138 --> 00:20:48,642
Sikes' run at the table
did draw a crowd.

00:20:48,642 --> 00:20:50,010
Meaning there are several people

00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:51,311

that looked like

00:20:56,249 --> 00:20:58,551
they were shadowing him

No, they're still

Nope.

00:21:54,574 --> 00:21:56,643
Looked like an old turntable

00:21:56,643 --> 00:21:59,012

you out with that, it's just...

00:21:59,012 --> 00:22:01,081

00:22:31,077 --> 00:22:33,246

These speakers, it's usually
just a, like, a wiring issue.

00:22:51,831 --> 00:22:53,767
Well, in this case,
I think it might be something

00:22:53,767 --> 00:22:54,868
just a little bit different.

00:22:59,639 --> 00:23:00,707
okay, that's a lot of money.

00:23:00,707 --> 00:23:03,076
I'm guessing about $350,000.

00:23:03,076 --> 00:23:04,144
I don't understand that.

00:23:04,144 --> 00:23:05,211
If I had that kind of money,

00:23:05,211 --> 00:23:06,546
I'd put it in, like, a bank.

00:23:06,546 --> 00:23:07,947
Unless you couldn't.

00:23:07,947 --> 00:23:10,116
Place like this,
people drop off an item,

00:23:10,116 --> 00:23:12,986
you keep it for 60 days,
then they come back to collect.

00:23:12,986 --> 00:23:14,287
Beats a bank

00:23:14,287 --> 00:23:16,856
if you're trying to beat
a murder charge.

00:23:18,591 --> 00:23:20,560
Pike's casino said Alonzo Pierce

00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,195
didn't show up for
his shift today.

00:23:22,195 --> 00:23:24,197
Getting to be a habit
with their workforce.

00:23:24,197 --> 00:23:26,232
Yeah, a real brain drain
at Pike's.

00:23:26,232 --> 00:23:28,668
We buzzed Alonzo's apartment,
no answer.

00:23:28,668 --> 00:23:30,870
His manager said he was going
on a trip; he took a small bag.

00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:32,572
When was this?
A few minutes ago.

00:23:32,572 --> 00:23:34,908

00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:12,879
Alonzo Pierce.

00:24:12,879 --> 00:24:14,714
That was a short trip.

00:24:14,714 --> 00:24:17,117
Yeah, well, nobody steals
from Pike's Gambling Hall.

00:24:17,117 --> 00:24:18,585
Well, at least somebody
at Pike's

00:24:18,585 --> 00:24:20,019
is dedicated to their job.

00:24:25,925 --> 00:24:27,193
Tell you something, Bobby,

00:24:27,193 --> 00:24:28,928
you make detective
work look simple.

00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:31,030
I mean, there you are, standing
there, gun in your hand,

00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:32,732
Alonzo's Pierce's
body in the trunk.

00:24:32,732 --> 00:24:34,968
I mean, all I had to do
was call a tow truck.

00:24:34,968 --> 00:24:36,803
I'm gonna make it
even easier for you.

00:24:36,803 --> 00:24:38,705
I'm gonna tell you exactly

00:24:38,705 --> 00:24:40,173
what that little bitch,
Alonzo, did.

00:24:40,173 --> 00:24:42,208
Tell me.

00:24:42,208 --> 00:24:45,645
You know I seen
a lot of cheats in my time.

00:24:45,645 --> 00:24:48,081
But last night, (sighs)
that was different.

00:24:48,081 --> 00:24:50,283
<i>I don't know exactly</i>
<i>what this guy</i>

00:24:50,283 --> 00:24:52,085
<i>and my dealer had going on,</i>

00:24:52,085 --> 00:24:55,155
but I knew the grift was on.

00:24:55,155 --> 00:24:57,790
It had to be,
'cause nobody's that lucky.

00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:00,026
See, in the old days, Vegas,

00:25:00,026 --> 00:25:03,296
when guys like Sam Braun used
to run the town,

00:25:03,296 --> 00:25:05,165
we would've put this guy
in a car,

00:25:05,165 --> 00:25:06,866
done a little carpentry on him.

00:25:06,866 --> 00:25:08,902
He would've given it up.

00:25:08,902 --> 00:25:10,904
Town's changed.

00:25:10,904 --> 00:25:12,038
Not for the better.

00:25:12,038 --> 00:25:13,973
Right, more civilized now.

00:25:13,973 --> 00:25:15,875
You whack guys in the alley.

00:25:15,875 --> 00:25:17,911
I didn't tell him
to whack the guy.

00:25:17,911 --> 00:25:20,280
<i>I just told him</i>
<i>to get the cash back</i>

00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,815
<i>and put a little healthy fear</i>
<i>of God in him</i>

00:25:22,815 --> 00:25:25,051
<i>before he put him</i>
<i>on the Trailways bus.</i>

00:25:25,051 --> 00:25:28,021
So Alonzo killed Sikes
on his own initiative?

00:25:28,021 --> 00:25:29,622
And he stole the cash.

00:25:29,622 --> 00:25:31,591
Believe that?

00:25:31,591 --> 00:25:34,861
I don't know what
to believe anymore, Bobby.

00:25:34,861 --> 00:25:37,730
I mentored him,

00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:39,165
and he turns around,

00:25:39,165 --> 00:25:40,667
this little bitch,

00:25:40,667 --> 00:25:42,535
and he doesn't have the cojones

00:25:42,535 --> 00:25:44,804
to look me in the eye
and tell me the truth?

00:25:44,804 --> 00:25:47,040
He has to make up some BS story

00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,676
about he didn't kill him.

00:25:49,676 --> 00:25:50,944
He just roughed him up,

00:25:50,944 --> 00:25:54,180
and he put the cash away
for safekeeping.

00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,982
I'm not gonna lie to you,

00:25:55,982 --> 00:25:58,218
I-I would've whacked him anyway,

00:25:58,218 --> 00:26:00,186
Alonzo,

00:26:00,186 --> 00:26:02,589
but that's because he stole
from the house.

00:26:04,724 --> 00:26:06,593
That's a matter of honor.

00:26:06,593 --> 00:26:09,128
Old Vegas.

00:26:09,128 --> 00:26:11,965
Damn straight.

00:26:14,067 --> 00:26:16,302
See, you and me, we're
on opposite sides of the table,

00:26:16,302 --> 00:26:17,737
but I know

00:26:17,737 --> 00:26:18,838
that right here,

00:26:18,838 --> 00:26:21,241
we're on the same page.

00:26:25,745 --> 00:26:27,714
I'm gonna ask you a favor.

00:26:27,714 --> 00:26:28,982
What's that?

00:26:28,982 --> 00:26:31,050
Put in a good word for me
at sentencing.

00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:34,954
I'd like to get sent up
to Carson City...

00:26:34,954 --> 00:26:36,756
with the old boys.

00:26:38,224 --> 00:26:41,060
Men of honor.

00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:43,796
Done.

00:26:48,668 --> 00:26:51,304
Heard you caught a case
with day shift.

00:26:51,304 --> 00:26:53,840
(chuckles)
Yeah, lucky me.

00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,241
Seems to be
case closed.

00:26:55,241 --> 00:26:56,743
Right.

00:26:56,743 --> 00:26:58,945
Homicide, guy's luck
ran out in the alley.

00:26:58,945 --> 00:27:00,280
Yeah, the casino pit boss

00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,715
sent one of his goons
after the guy.

00:27:02,715 --> 00:27:04,017
The goon kills him,

00:27:04,017 --> 00:27:05,652
takes the money, and
then he stashes it

00:27:05,652 --> 00:27:08,721
in a stereo speaker
and then pawns it.

00:27:08,721 --> 00:27:10,323
Now, why am I doing this?

00:27:10,323 --> 00:27:12,625
This day shift guy, Yeager,

00:27:12,625 --> 00:27:14,227
really wants this solve,
he should be the one

00:27:14,227 --> 00:27:15,962
finishing up the paperwork.

00:27:15,962 --> 00:27:17,964
Your victim was stabbed
multiple times, wasn't he?

00:27:17,964 --> 00:27:19,666
Yeah, why?

00:27:19,666 --> 00:27:21,734
I don't know, I'm just looking
at the timestamps

00:27:21,734 --> 00:27:23,269
on these photos.

00:27:23,269 --> 00:27:24,904
So, the security goon

00:27:24,904 --> 00:27:26,873
gets his orders
from the pit boss

00:27:26,873 --> 00:27:29,309
at 2:48 a.m.?

00:27:29,309 --> 00:27:31,311
Yeah, and then the goon
follows him to the alley

00:27:31,311 --> 00:27:33,746
and kills him around 3:00.

00:27:33,746 --> 00:27:35,114
What are you seeing?

00:27:35,114 --> 00:27:37,083
You know,
what about the clothes?

00:27:37,083 --> 00:27:38,084
Doesn't this look like

00:27:38,084 --> 00:27:39,952
the same suit, same shirt,

00:27:39,952 --> 00:27:41,287
same tie?

00:27:41,287 --> 00:27:43,890
Oh, my God, you're right.

00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:45,925
Guy stabs him 12 times,
and he doesn't have

00:27:45,925 --> 00:27:47,860
a single drop of blood
on his clothes.

00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:51,297
Yeager still hasn't
gotten his solve.

00:27:51,297 --> 00:27:53,266
SANDERS:
Hey, Morgan,

00:27:53,266 --> 00:27:54,934
I've been looking for you.

00:27:54,934 --> 00:27:57,003
So your security guard
didn't kill Sikes.

00:27:57,003 --> 00:27:58,738
Yeah, I know.

00:27:58,738 --> 00:28:00,573
What, Hodges told
you about the bullet?

00:28:00,573 --> 00:28:02,208
What bullet?

00:28:02,208 --> 00:28:04,210
The metal fragment we found
in Sikes' wound track.

00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:05,845
We thought it was
the tip of the knife,

00:28:05,845 --> 00:28:07,313
but it turns out
it's from a bullet.

00:28:07,313 --> 00:28:08,748
I thought he was stabbed.

00:28:08,748 --> 00:28:10,249
Now you're saying he was shot?

00:28:10,249 --> 00:28:11,684
Yeah, twice.

00:28:11,684 --> 00:28:13,286
(two gunshots)

00:28:13,286 --> 00:28:15,188
<i>And then the killer</i>
<i>used the knife</i>

00:28:15,188 --> 00:28:17,890
<i>to dig out the bullets,</i>
<i>and then proceeded to stab him</i>

00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:19,258
<i>ten more times.</i>

00:28:19,258 --> 00:28:20,727
To throw us off track.

00:28:20,727 --> 00:28:22,195
Well, that's where he made
his mistake.

00:28:22,195 --> 00:28:23,596
Doc thought he recognized
the wound pattern,

00:28:23,596 --> 00:28:24,864
so I did some checking,

00:28:24,864 --> 00:28:26,632
found an open case
from two years ago,

wasting time with a nobody
like Jeremy Sikes?

00:28:44,083 --> 00:28:45,284
I have an idea about that.

00:28:45,284 --> 00:28:46,853
Turns out, a month ago,

00:28:46,853 --> 00:28:48,654
Delgado walked in
on a robbery

00:28:48,654 --> 00:28:50,022
at his house.

00:28:50,022 --> 00:28:52,058
He got shot,
and his girlfriend called it in.

00:28:52,058 --> 00:28:53,760
You think Sikes was the robber.

I do,

DEA surveillance
just alibied him out.

00:30:23,549 --> 00:30:25,184
Okay, but that doesn't mean
that he didn't get

00:30:25,184 --> 00:30:27,086
one of his own guys
to do it for him.

00:30:27,086 --> 00:30:28,688
That's true, but
the rep on Delgado

00:30:28,688 --> 00:30:30,223
is that he's very hands-on.

00:30:30,223 --> 00:30:32,024

00:32:02,248 --> 00:32:04,850
This Jeremy Sikes is just
one unlucky burglar?

00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:06,852
I thought we agreed that luck
wasn't a player here.

00:32:06,852 --> 00:32:08,788
No, the shootings weren't
an accident,

00:32:08,788 --> 00:32:11,824
and the robberies
were cover stories.

00:32:11,824 --> 00:32:13,993
Remember how Kristi Holt

00:32:13,993 --> 00:32:16,162
left her husband's watch
off of the insurance claim?

00:32:16,162 --> 00:32:18,030
Well, the same goes
for all of these homeowners.

00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,832
YEAGER:
22 items stolen,

00:32:19,832 --> 00:32:22,001
and not one of them reported
by the victims' survivors?

00:32:22,001 --> 00:32:24,570
I mean, personally,
I... we think that

00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:26,005
it's payment
for services rendered.

00:32:26,005 --> 00:32:28,107
I agree.

00:32:28,107 --> 00:32:31,110
We had a case like this
up in Seattle.

00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:33,713
Low-rent hit man for hire ring.

00:32:33,713 --> 00:32:35,081
Advertised in the personals.

00:32:35,081 --> 00:32:36,782
Called themselves
"problem solvers."

00:32:36,782 --> 00:32:37,883
They're pretty good, too.

00:32:37,883 --> 00:32:39,018
Flew under the radar

00:32:39,018 --> 00:32:40,586
for a long time.

00:32:40,586 --> 00:32:42,288
So how'd you bust them?
Caught a break.

00:32:42,288 --> 00:32:45,024
Turned out one of the hit men
was a coke addict.

00:32:45,024 --> 00:32:47,593
Burned through his money,
started shooting off his mouth,

00:32:47,593 --> 00:32:49,795
I guess he became
a liability.

00:32:49,795 --> 00:32:52,698
'Cause the head guy decided
to hit the hit man.

00:32:52,698 --> 00:32:54,266
So Jeremy Sikes
became a liability.

00:32:54,266 --> 00:32:56,969
Only instead of blow,
it was blackjack.

00:32:56,969 --> 00:32:58,738
BRODY: All this loot,
he should've been flush,

00:32:58,738 --> 00:33:02,642
but instead,
he was living on the streets

00:33:02,642 --> 00:33:04,243
with his last $200.

00:33:04,243 --> 00:33:06,679
Sounds like a liability to me.

00:33:06,679 --> 00:33:09,615
One that the broker
decided to eliminate

00:33:09,615 --> 00:33:11,017
by framing Delgado.

00:33:11,017 --> 00:33:14,120
The only question is:
Who's the broker?

00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,822
Kristi, in addition
to your husband's watch,

00:33:16,822 --> 00:33:19,325
we also recovered these
other items that were stolen

00:33:19,325 --> 00:33:20,760
by Jeremy Sikes.

00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,162
The... the man who broke
into my house.

00:33:23,162 --> 00:33:25,564
And murdered
your husband, Simon.

00:33:25,564 --> 00:33:27,667
RUSSELL:
That's roughly,
we figure,

00:33:27,667 --> 00:33:29,935
about $5,000 worth
right there.

00:33:29,935 --> 00:33:32,638
That's an awful lot
of valuable stuff

00:33:32,638 --> 00:33:34,740
to forget to report,
don't you think?

00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,008
(sighs)

00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:39,545
Listen, we know that you...

00:33:39,545 --> 00:33:41,247
you bought this watch
for Simon for your...

00:33:41,247 --> 00:33:42,848
your anniversary, right?

00:33:42,848 --> 00:33:44,884
But you did not buy
this bracelet for him.

00:33:44,884 --> 00:33:46,152
Someone else did.

00:33:46,152 --> 00:33:47,720
Another woman.

00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,855
BRODY:
We traced the purchase
back to a...

00:33:49,855 --> 00:33:50,790
Tiana Lee.

00:33:53,626 --> 00:33:55,094
Oh, come on, Kristi,
we understand.

00:33:55,094 --> 00:33:56,562
I mean...

00:33:56,562 --> 00:33:58,197
you're working
two jobs, right?

00:33:58,197 --> 00:33:59,965
And you're
still in debt

00:33:59,965 --> 00:34:02,935
because Simon spends the money
as fast as you can make it.

00:34:05,304 --> 00:34:06,939
What happened?

00:34:06,939 --> 00:34:09,308
You came back
from work one night,

00:34:09,308 --> 00:34:10,810
he wasn't there.

00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:12,712
He was out again.

00:34:12,712 --> 00:34:14,180
Then he shows up.

00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:16,082
Maybe he's drunk.

00:34:16,082 --> 00:34:18,150
And you ask him,
"Where were you?

00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,652
What were you doing?"

00:34:19,652 --> 00:34:21,554
Maybe he hits you.

00:34:22,955 --> 00:34:25,057
Maybe he does that a lot.

00:34:27,093 --> 00:34:29,995
And then, one day,
someone, a friend,

00:34:29,995 --> 00:34:33,199
suggests a solution.

00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:35,901
And all you can think
about is getting rid

00:34:35,901 --> 00:34:38,804
of that pain, all that sadness.

00:34:41,207 --> 00:34:43,042
Look, Kristi...

00:34:45,077 --> 00:34:49,048
We know that, in your heart,
you are not a killer.

00:34:50,916 --> 00:34:54,854
And that you... you feel
guilty about all of this.

00:34:54,854 --> 00:34:56,822
But this is your chance

00:34:56,822 --> 00:34:59,091
to get rid of some
of that guilt.

00:35:02,762 --> 00:35:05,064
By telling us the
truth right now.

00:35:09,568 --> 00:35:10,803
KRISTI:
But you're right.

00:35:12,238 --> 00:35:14,607
About Simon.

00:35:14,607 --> 00:35:16,542
About the friend.

00:35:16,542 --> 00:35:20,112
That person gave me
an e-mail address of a broker.

00:35:20,112 --> 00:35:24,617
I was told
to follow instructions.

00:35:24,617 --> 00:35:27,620
They were going to make it
look like a robbery,

00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:31,190
and I was told to leave
certain items off the report.

00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:32,691
To pay the hit man.

00:35:32,691 --> 00:35:34,560
I wasn't lying

00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,630
when I said
that I never met the guy.

00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:40,032
Him just... sitting at my table

00:35:40,032 --> 00:35:42,601
and going on that
insane run was just...

00:35:42,601 --> 00:35:44,537
Dumb luck?

00:35:44,537 --> 00:35:45,571
What about the broker?

00:35:45,571 --> 00:35:47,106
I paid $5,000 up front,

00:35:47,106 --> 00:35:48,908
and they set up a meet.

00:35:48,908 --> 00:35:49,975
You remember where?

00:35:49,975 --> 00:35:50,976
At a pawnshop.

00:35:53,045 --> 00:35:54,713
Oh.

00:35:54,713 --> 00:35:56,615
Is this the guy that you paid?

00:35:56,615 --> 00:35:58,751
No. I think
he runs the place.

00:35:58,751 --> 00:35:59,885
The broker's a woman.

00:35:59,885 --> 00:36:01,287
Older.

00:36:01,287 --> 00:36:02,855
She said she
hangs out there.

00:36:02,855 --> 00:36:05,124
(cell phone ringing)

00:36:05,124 --> 00:36:06,859
Russell.

00:36:06,859 --> 00:36:08,260
When?

00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,795
What now?

00:36:09,795 --> 00:36:11,096
Somebody just went
into Ruby's Pawn Shop,

00:36:11,096 --> 00:36:12,031
shot the place up.

00:36:17,269 --> 00:36:18,904
BRODY:
Akers, what the hell happened?

00:36:20,606 --> 00:36:22,842
According to Ms. Banks,
two armed men entered.

00:36:22,842 --> 00:36:24,109
They were looking for something.

00:36:24,109 --> 00:36:25,544
She doesn't know what.

00:36:25,544 --> 00:36:26,745
They shot her son, Kyle.

00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,114
Took her other son, Zeke.

00:36:29,114 --> 00:36:30,883
Okay. Thanks.

00:36:32,051 --> 00:36:34,854
(crying)

00:36:34,854 --> 00:36:36,856
Who would do
something like this?

00:36:36,856 --> 00:36:37,990
I don't know.

00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:39,658
But I think you do.

00:36:39,658 --> 00:36:40,659
Excuse me?

00:36:40,659 --> 00:36:42,161
Kristi Holt gave you up.

00:36:42,161 --> 00:36:44,029
We know Jeremy Sikes worked
for you as a hit man,

00:36:44,029 --> 00:36:45,531
and we have a pretty good idea

00:36:45,531 --> 00:36:46,866
how you terminated
his employment.

00:36:46,866 --> 00:36:48,767
What is wrong with you people?

00:36:48,767 --> 00:36:50,769
My son is lying there dead,

00:36:50,769 --> 00:36:53,138
and now they've got
my other boy, Zeke.

00:36:53,138 --> 00:36:55,207
Ruby, it's over.
I didn't kill Sikes.

00:36:55,207 --> 00:36:57,710
But I know who did--
it was Delgado.

00:36:57,710 --> 00:37:00,546
I mean, the word on the street
is it's his signature.

00:37:00,546 --> 00:37:03,048
Two shots to the back,
bullets dug out.

00:37:03,048 --> 00:37:04,783
Sikes even tried
to write Delgado's name.

00:37:04,783 --> 00:37:06,619
That is one hell of a story.

00:37:06,619 --> 00:37:09,255
But word on my street is
that you're a sociopath.

00:37:09,255 --> 00:37:11,557
You're the one who
killed Jeremy Sikes...

00:37:11,557 --> 00:37:12,892
(two gunshots)

00:37:12,892 --> 00:37:15,127
<i>...and framed Delgado.</i>

00:37:17,096 --> 00:37:18,931
BRODY:
And you know exactly
who came here

00:37:18,931 --> 00:37:20,199
and why.

00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:22,001
If you don't come clean,

00:37:22,001 --> 00:37:23,903
you're going to
lose another son.

00:37:23,903 --> 00:37:25,070
Come on, Ruby.

00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:26,605
We know how much
you love your boy.

00:37:26,605 --> 00:37:27,773
Okay, you're right.

00:37:27,773 --> 00:37:29,575
I killed Sikes, but...

00:37:29,575 --> 00:37:32,912
my boys didn't know anything
about the side business.

00:37:32,912 --> 00:37:36,982
Sikes stole this cigar box
from Delgado,

00:37:36,982 --> 00:37:39,251
<i>and it wasn't even</i>
<i>worth anything--</i>

00:37:39,251 --> 00:37:41,020
<i>it was a few hundred bucks--</i>

00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:43,055
<i>but what was inside</i>
<i>was worth a lot more.</i>

00:37:43,055 --> 00:37:45,024
<i>It was 100 grand in heroin.</i>

00:37:45,024 --> 00:37:46,292
Where are the drugs?

00:37:48,761 --> 00:37:50,229
I sold them.

00:37:51,931 --> 00:37:53,632
But Delgado's guys
don't know this.

00:37:53,632 --> 00:37:56,902
Zeke, he wanted to protect me,
so he lied to them.

00:37:56,902 --> 00:37:58,604
He said he knew
what they wanted

00:37:58,604 --> 00:38:00,606
and he would
take them to it.

00:38:00,606 --> 00:38:03,575
When Delgado finds out
that he lied,

00:38:03,575 --> 00:38:05,611
he's going to kill him.

00:38:07,179 --> 00:38:09,181
(indistinct chatter)

00:38:12,318 --> 00:38:13,819
Back again so soon?

00:38:13,819 --> 00:38:14,920
Where's the kid, Delgado?

00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,188
What kid?

00:38:16,188 --> 00:38:18,057
I know you got him
in some basement,

00:38:18,057 --> 00:38:19,925
beating the hell out of him,
but he doesn't know anything.

00:38:19,925 --> 00:38:21,560
You're not going to
get your drugs back

00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,929
because his mother has
already sold them.

00:38:23,929 --> 00:38:25,264
They're gone.

00:38:25,264 --> 00:38:27,299
Are you going to make
me ask you again?

00:38:27,299 --> 00:38:28,767
Where is he?!

00:38:28,767 --> 00:38:30,536
Hey. I think you need to start

00:38:30,536 --> 00:38:31,904
showing me
a little more respect.

00:38:34,273 --> 00:38:36,675
This is my house.
Yeah, right.

00:38:36,675 --> 00:38:39,178
Look, your lapdog is
going to mess on the rug.

00:38:39,178 --> 00:38:40,546
If he doesn't get

00:38:40,546 --> 00:38:41,880
his hand off his gun...

00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,782
Or... what are you
going to do about it?

00:38:46,085 --> 00:38:47,252
(patrons screaming)

00:38:47,252 --> 00:38:49,054
(man groaning)

00:38:49,054 --> 00:38:52,257
Now that I have
your attention...

00:38:52,257 --> 00:38:54,059
You tell me where
the kid is,

00:38:54,059 --> 00:38:55,294
and we all go home.

00:38:56,996 --> 00:38:59,131
Or we all got to
die sometime.

00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,702
You're new in town,
so here's your play.

00:39:03,702 --> 00:39:05,738
Here's what the guys
in Vegas used to say--

00:39:05,738 --> 00:39:07,639
in the old Vegas:

00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:10,175
It's your house,
it's your rules.

00:39:13,078 --> 00:39:15,280
You got that right.

00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:39,972
I think you got yourself a fan.

00:39:39,972 --> 00:39:43,075
(chuckles) No, he just likes
the way I handle power tools.

00:39:43,075 --> 00:39:45,210
No, I wasn't talking about him.

00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:46,812
Oh.

00:39:46,812 --> 00:39:48,847
Well, congratulations.

00:39:48,847 --> 00:39:50,716
You got your solve.

00:39:50,716 --> 00:39:52,885
No. You take it.

00:39:52,885 --> 00:39:55,220
I mean, you earned it.
I'll catch the next one.

00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:56,722
Maybe I'll catch it with you.

00:39:59,758 --> 00:40:01,260
I'll see you around.

00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,162
Yeah.

00:40:09,568 --> 00:40:11,003
This is nice.

00:40:11,003 --> 00:40:12,771
I'm glad you could
finally get a night off.

00:40:12,771 --> 00:40:15,274
You should thank Finn.
She's covering for me.

00:40:15,274 --> 00:40:17,309
You have a... a great
group of people here, D.B.

00:40:17,309 --> 00:40:20,312
They work so well together,
and they're like a family.

00:40:20,312 --> 00:40:23,148
You should feel good about that.

00:40:23,148 --> 00:40:24,817
I do.

00:40:27,152 --> 00:40:28,253
Charlie--

00:40:28,253 --> 00:40:30,689
has he made
any decisions yet?

00:40:30,689 --> 00:40:32,558
No. Not yet.

00:40:33,959 --> 00:40:35,561
And what about you?

00:40:37,029 --> 00:40:38,130
What's going on?

00:40:40,566 --> 00:40:42,634
This last trip to Seattle,

00:40:42,634 --> 00:40:45,270
I made a pilgrimage
to that neighborhood

00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:47,739
that we used to love
to drive through,

00:40:47,739 --> 00:40:50,309
with the house on the
hill, with the view.

00:40:50,309 --> 00:40:51,910
I remember.

00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:56,014
We used to fantasize
walking up to the front door,

00:40:56,014 --> 00:40:58,784
knocking and asking
if they would sell it to us.

00:40:58,784 --> 00:41:00,719
I did that.

00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:02,754
And they're an
older couple,

00:41:02,754 --> 00:41:04,590
and they're very
open to the idea.

00:41:06,925 --> 00:41:08,794
Okay, don't look
at me like that.

00:41:08,794 --> 00:41:11,830
Well... you're serious?

00:41:13,932 --> 00:41:16,835
We have a house--
here.

00:41:16,835 --> 00:41:18,770
We've talked about
this before.

00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:20,739
You can't do this
job forever.

00:41:20,739 --> 00:41:24,843
And I don't want to wait
forever for this house.

00:41:25,911 --> 00:41:27,713
Where's this coming from?

00:41:27,713 --> 00:41:29,581
I'm worried about you.

00:41:29,581 --> 00:41:32,284
I think... I think this
job is getting to you.

00:41:32,284 --> 00:41:34,853
It's not. I'm fine.

00:41:35,921 --> 00:41:37,956
I don't believe that.

00:41:37,956 --> 00:41:38,924
Well, I'm fine.

00:41:47,966 --> 00:41:49,801
I'm sorry. Come here.

00:41:56,108 --> 00:41:59,545
My work here isn't done yet,
but when it is,

00:41:59,545 --> 00:42:02,247
when that day comes, you and I

00:42:02,247 --> 00:42:05,584
will go back up
to Seattle, and we'll...

00:42:05,584 --> 00:42:07,319
we'll both knock
on that door together.

00:42:09,688 --> 00:42:11,290
I promise.

00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,195
I accept.
