00:00:16,542 --> 00:00:17,843
WOMAN:
It's to you, Mr. Gentry.

00:00:17,843 --> 00:00:20,112
$65,000 to call.

00:00:20,112 --> 00:00:22,114
You've been playing me
all night.

00:00:22,114 --> 00:00:23,849
(sighs)

00:00:23,849 --> 00:00:25,584
In fact, I think
you're playing me right now.

00:00:27,419 --> 00:00:29,121
What about you, Audrey?

00:00:29,121 --> 00:00:32,124
You think this kid's trying
to pull one over on me again?

00:00:32,124 --> 00:00:34,092
AUDREY:
I couldn't say.

00:00:34,092 --> 00:00:35,661
Well, what the hell.

00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:37,663
It's only money, right?

00:00:41,033 --> 00:00:43,101
I'm all in.

00:00:43,101 --> 00:00:44,903
(murmuring)

00:00:48,407 --> 00:00:50,142
I'll call.

00:00:50,142 --> 00:00:51,910
Let's do it.

00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:55,881
(murmuring)

00:00:57,449 --> 00:00:59,751
Mr. Gentry shows a straight.

00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:06,158
Two pair. Aces and kings.

00:01:06,158 --> 00:01:07,993
(laughing):
Oh, I knew it.

00:01:07,993 --> 00:01:09,161
I got you.

00:01:09,161 --> 00:01:11,096
Three-to-one odds
in my favor.

00:01:11,096 --> 00:01:12,798
This one's finally
gonna be mine.

00:01:12,798 --> 00:01:15,133
$490,000
in the pot.

00:01:27,512 --> 00:01:29,781
Oh, no. No damn way.

00:01:29,781 --> 00:01:31,850
The ace makes a full house.

00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:33,051
Tough luck, man.

00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:35,554
Maybe next time.

00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:36,922
Cash me out?

00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:40,926
Congrats.

00:01:40,926 --> 00:01:43,929
What are we looking at,
a little over $600,000?

00:01:45,964 --> 00:01:47,499
(switch clacks,
power whirrs off)

00:01:47,499 --> 00:01:48,734
Sorry, gentlemen.

00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:50,035
Back-ups will
kick in any second.

00:01:50,035 --> 00:01:51,703
In the meantime,
everybody keep your hands

00:01:51,703 --> 00:01:52,904
away from the table, please.

00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:54,539
This is Brantson.
We lost power

00:01:54,539 --> 00:01:56,708
in the Rialto Room.

00:01:56,708 --> 00:01:58,543
MAN (over radio):
That repair crew's on its way.

00:01:59,878 --> 00:02:01,580
GAMBLER:
Hey, what's going on, man?

00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,848
(explosion)

00:02:02,848 --> 00:02:05,417
(people shouting)

00:02:10,022 --> 00:02:11,456
(explosion)

00:02:11,456 --> 00:02:12,658
(people screaming)

00:02:12,658 --> 00:02:14,493
(high-pitched oscillating tone)

00:02:17,629 --> 00:02:18,764
(gunshot)

00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:26,071
(grunting)

00:02:27,506 --> 00:02:29,574
(engine revving,
tires squealing)

00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,446
(engine revving)

00:02:36,882 --> 00:02:39,651
(tires squealing,
engine revving)

00:02:43,055 --> 00:02:46,024
(people screaming, shouting)

00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:51,630
(engine revving)

00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,864
(siren whooping)

00:02:52,864 --> 00:02:54,700
(tires screech)

00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:58,036
(engine revs, tires screech)

00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:08,180
(engine revving)

00:03:16,688 --> 00:03:18,623
(tires screeching)

00:03:19,691 --> 00:03:20,992
(siren wailing)

00:03:23,528 --> 00:03:25,163
Everybody get back!
Out of the way!

00:03:27,966 --> 00:03:29,668
(engine revving)

00:03:34,906 --> 00:03:36,641
(glass clinking)

00:03:40,145 --> 00:03:43,415
(crowd murmuring)

00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:47,619
(filtered breathing)

00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:00,165
This maniac hit the Four Kings,

00:04:00,165 --> 00:04:02,434
made off
with over a million bucks.

00:04:02,434 --> 00:04:04,770
Well, I wouldn't exactly
say he "made off."

00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,538
No, you're right.

00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:08,940
Even if you leave with it,
this town has a twisted way

00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,175
of getting it back
from you, doesn't it?

00:04:10,175 --> 00:04:11,743
Security guard's
pretty shaken up.

00:04:11,743 --> 00:04:13,612
He never shot anyone before.

00:04:13,612 --> 00:04:15,046
PHILLIPS:
Well, he still hasn't.

00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,915
There's no wound,
there's no blood.

00:04:16,915 --> 00:04:18,950
Nothing.

00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,685
STOKES:
Why'd he go down?

00:04:20,685 --> 00:04:22,654
SIDLE:
Ugh.

00:04:22,654 --> 00:04:23,822
What the hell happened to him?

00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:27,058
STOKES:
Whoa, he's swollen.

00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:28,560
Aah...
AKERS:
Here you go.

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,795
We were able to collect

00:04:29,795 --> 00:04:31,730
just about all
the scattered cash.

00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,533
Are you sure the upstanding
citizens of Fremont didn't try

00:04:34,533 --> 00:04:36,101
to stuff their pockets?

00:04:36,101 --> 00:04:38,136
(scoffs) With this?
Why bother? It's counterfeit.

00:04:40,672 --> 00:04:43,608
STOKES:
Yeah. Yeah, I'll say.

00:04:43,608 --> 00:04:45,610
And bad counterfeit at that.

00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,946
Chips are fake too.
They're plastic.

00:04:47,946 --> 00:04:49,714
So this guy

00:04:49,714 --> 00:04:51,583
leaves the casino
with over a million dollars.

00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,784
(chips clinking)

00:04:52,784 --> 00:04:54,419
Where did it go?

00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:55,987
STOKES:
I don't know. I'd ask him,

00:04:55,987 --> 00:04:57,722
but I don't think he's
gonna be much help.

(low, indistinct conversations)

00:05:54,012 --> 00:05:56,448
Oh, his name is Paul Brantson.

00:05:56,448 --> 00:05:59,818
He was only 25 years old.

00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:02,087
Married his
high school sweetheart

00:06:02,087 --> 00:06:04,022
just six months ago.

00:06:09,527 --> 00:06:10,729
(camera shutter clicks)

00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:12,697
This is your first one back.

00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:15,667
You went through a lot.

00:06:17,102 --> 00:06:19,537
I can handle this
if you need me to.

00:06:19,537 --> 00:06:21,806
No. I'm fine.

00:06:23,942 --> 00:06:25,143
You know, I gotta do it.
(laughs)

00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:39,524
I'm Captain Jim Brass.

00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,860
Tell me what you told
the other police officers.

00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,764
I... It all happened so fast,
I, uh...

00:06:45,764 --> 00:06:46,998
like it wasn't even real.

00:06:46,998 --> 00:06:48,800
Like when you wake up,
and you can't

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,635
even remember
what you just dreamed.

00:06:50,635 --> 00:06:52,437
Okay, I want you
to think real hard.

00:06:52,437 --> 00:06:54,139
Before the lights went out,
did anything happen

00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:56,408
that might have tipped you off
that something was up?

00:06:56,408 --> 00:06:58,109
Uh... I don't know.

00:06:58,109 --> 00:07:00,145
I just...I can't remember!

00:07:00,145 --> 00:07:03,648
Um...I had a glass
or two of wine.

00:07:03,648 --> 00:07:05,083
Just, I don't...
just trying to calm

00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:07,419
my nerves. I...

00:07:07,419 --> 00:07:08,620
Sorry.

00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,088
Thank you. Excuse me.

00:07:13,024 --> 00:07:15,593
I talked to about
ten witnesses.

00:07:15,593 --> 00:07:18,763
Not one of them can be sure
of what they saw.

00:07:18,763 --> 00:07:20,165
This whole thing looks
like it was

00:07:20,165 --> 00:07:24,002
designed that way--
to confuse.
(phone ringing)

00:07:24,002 --> 00:07:26,604
Oh.

00:07:26,604 --> 00:07:28,673
Says 201 area code.
That's New Jersey.

00:07:28,673 --> 00:07:31,810
You still settling
Nancy's estate?

00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:34,079
Mundane little things
that are just never ending.

00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,714
If you need to take that,
go ahead.

00:07:35,714 --> 00:07:37,582
We can handle things.
Yeah, thanks.

00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:41,019
Hey.

00:07:41,019 --> 00:07:42,620
Everything okay?

00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,055
(sighs) Help me focus.

00:07:44,055 --> 00:07:45,690
What do we know?

00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:48,893
Well, winner was cashing in
on over 600 grand.

00:07:48,893 --> 00:07:50,996
His chips on the table,
cash to match,

00:07:50,996 --> 00:07:54,466
more stolen from the cart.
Total take--

00:07:54,466 --> 00:07:57,068
just over a million
and a half.

00:07:57,068 --> 00:07:59,704
A million and a half
that's still missing.

00:07:59,704 --> 00:08:02,507
Yeah, but the timing is
what's bothering me.

00:08:02,507 --> 00:08:07,512
The suspect knew exactly
what time to hit--the pay-out.

00:08:07,512 --> 00:08:10,115
So he had eyes in the room.

00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:11,916
Anyone here stand out?

00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:14,853
No, but there is a guy
who's still missing.

00:08:14,853 --> 00:08:16,488
Robert Gentry.

00:08:16,488 --> 00:08:18,423
<i>He was the last player</i>
<i>out of the game.</i>

00:08:18,423 --> 00:08:20,558
<i>Gone before</i>
<i>the first cops arrived.</i>

00:08:20,558 --> 00:08:22,527
You think
he's our guy in the room?

00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,062
Couple witnesses said

00:08:24,062 --> 00:08:27,832
that Gentry and our suspect
collided during the robbery.

00:08:27,832 --> 00:08:32,904
<i>What that an accident,</i>
<i>or was it a hand-off?</i>

00:08:32,904 --> 00:08:35,106
It would explain
where the money went.

00:08:35,106 --> 00:08:37,042
RUSSELL:
Yeah.

00:08:37,042 --> 00:08:39,644
Let's find Gentry.

00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,581
(Robbins grunting with effort)

00:08:43,581 --> 00:08:45,150
(Robbins groaning, grunting)

00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:50,922
You three want
to be left alone?

00:08:50,922 --> 00:08:52,757
Very funny, Finn.

00:08:52,757 --> 00:08:54,426
I could use a hand

00:08:54,426 --> 00:08:56,995
getting these
leathers off.
Sure.

00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:59,731
Ah, it's tight.
Must have been

00:08:59,731 --> 00:09:01,633
a size or two smaller
when he bought them.

00:09:04,469 --> 00:09:05,670
Whoa.

00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,072
I venture to say
he was a size

00:09:07,072 --> 00:09:09,607
or two smaller when
he put them on.

00:09:09,607 --> 00:09:12,577
<i>He didn't start the day</i>
<i>like this.</i>

00:09:12,577 --> 00:09:14,946
<i>Body's swollen;</i>
<i>significant edema.</i>

00:09:14,946 --> 00:09:17,482
<i>Some sort</i>
<i>of allergic reaction, maybe.</i>

00:09:17,482 --> 00:09:20,919
FINLAY: Clint Tyree.
He worked at the Four Kings.

00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:23,488
Yeah, he rode a motorcycle
in their stunt show.

00:09:23,488 --> 00:09:25,123
Can't say I've ever seen it.

00:09:25,123 --> 00:09:28,726
Judging by these X-rays,
must be

00:09:28,726 --> 00:09:30,128
a hell of a show.

00:09:30,128 --> 00:09:32,931
He's broken almost
every bone in his body.

00:09:32,931 --> 00:09:35,667
Hmm...

00:09:35,667 --> 00:09:39,504
Huh. Guy could have used
a new pair of boots.

00:09:39,504 --> 00:09:41,706
So what do you think caused
his allergic reaction?

00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:44,843
Well, I saw a raised mark
on his shoulder.

00:09:44,843 --> 00:09:48,513
Could be as simple
as a bee sting or spider bite.

00:09:48,513 --> 00:09:51,816
A guy robs a casino,
shoots a security guard,

00:09:51,816 --> 00:09:53,551
and rides off on
a motorcycle,

00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:54,919
and gets killed by an insect?

00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:56,688
I only said it could be.

00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:02,794
It's the left shoulder, right?

00:10:02,794 --> 00:10:04,829
Look at that.

00:10:04,829 --> 00:10:06,898
An injection mark.

00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:09,868
Somebody did this
to him on purpose.

00:10:13,037 --> 00:10:15,740
You need anything else
before I zip him up?

00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,108
No, no, go ahead.

00:10:17,108 --> 00:10:18,610
You can take him.
Oh.

00:10:22,547 --> 00:10:25,483
Ma'am, please...
Is that him? Is that Paul?

00:10:25,483 --> 00:10:27,051
I'm so sorry, ma'am,
but you can't be here.

00:10:27,051 --> 00:10:28,520
That's my husband!

00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,522
I have to see him!

00:10:30,522 --> 00:10:32,924
Please?

00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:35,093
Are you sure
you want to do this?

00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:36,661
(quietly, weakly):
Please?

00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:42,767
Okay.

00:10:50,508 --> 00:10:52,110
(whimpers)
Ma'am.

00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:55,513
(stifled crying)

00:10:55,513 --> 00:10:58,416
All the while
he was on active duty,

00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:01,452
four tours of Afghanistan,

00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:03,855
he wouldn't marry me.

00:11:03,855 --> 00:11:05,557
You know why?

00:11:05,557 --> 00:11:08,927
He was afraid
of making me a widow.

00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,795
He didn't want
to put me through that

00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,931
if something happened
to him over there.

00:11:14,999 --> 00:11:17,936
(sniffles, cries)

00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,972
I'm so sorry.

00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:23,608
(crying):
How does this happen?

00:11:23,608 --> 00:11:25,843
How does he survive
four years of hell

00:11:25,843 --> 00:11:28,112
over there,
just to come back home

00:11:28,112 --> 00:11:31,616
and die where
he's supposed to be safe?

00:11:32,884 --> 00:11:34,519
(sobbing):
Oh, God!

00:11:39,591 --> 00:11:41,926
(footsteps approaching)

00:11:41,926 --> 00:11:43,094
Talk to me, Hodges.

00:11:43,094 --> 00:11:46,931
(speaking Chinese)

00:11:46,931 --> 00:11:48,566
In English.

00:11:48,566 --> 00:11:51,102
The writing on these
newspaper bits is Chinese.

00:11:51,102 --> 00:11:52,837
That, combined
with traces of carbon,

00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,672
potassium nitrate, and sulfur,

00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:57,141
tells me the explosives
used in the heist

00:11:57,141 --> 00:11:59,110
are essentially untraceable.

00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:01,846
They're Chinese fireworks.
M-80s, most likely.

00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,415
Available at most any fireworks
stand outside the city,

00:12:04,415 --> 00:12:05,817
if you flash a little cash.

00:12:05,817 --> 00:12:07,018
Which brings us

00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:09,454
to our next potential dead end,

00:12:09,454 --> 00:12:10,922
the strobe ball.

00:12:10,922 --> 00:12:13,057
It's a visual effects device
used in the motorcycle

00:12:13,057 --> 00:12:15,026
stunt show
of the Four Kings Casino.

00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:18,997
The suspect could've stolen that
from his job...

00:12:18,997 --> 00:12:20,965
What about the casino's
security video?

00:12:20,965 --> 00:12:23,935
To complete
the dead-end trifecta?

00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:26,137
<i>Après moi.</i>

00:12:27,805 --> 00:12:29,173
STOKES:
Okay, there he is.

00:12:29,173 --> 00:12:30,708
That's him, right there.

00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,143
That's the guy
we're looking for.

00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,714
What's going on?

00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:38,583
It's the strobe.

00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:40,518
The camera's aperture
couldn't keep up with it.

00:12:40,518 --> 00:12:42,053
It doesn't get any better.

00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:43,655
So fix it.

00:12:43,655 --> 00:12:45,023
What do you propose I do?

00:12:45,023 --> 00:12:46,758
I don't know.

00:12:46,758 --> 00:12:50,094
We got to find out if this guy
Gentry was in on this heist.

00:12:50,094 --> 00:12:51,496
You want me to do it?

00:12:51,496 --> 00:12:53,431
No, no, n...
I got it.

00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,673
The lights in the Rialto Room
work just the same

00:13:01,673 --> 00:13:03,541
as the lights in
the rest of the casino.

00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:05,677
They're all automated,
controlled by a central system.

00:13:05,677 --> 00:13:07,612
So how's the system
controlled?

00:13:07,612 --> 00:13:10,014
You have to be able to turn
the lights on and off
when you want to.

00:13:10,014 --> 00:13:12,150
Well, it's... like
everything else these days,

00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,851
it's, uh... (clears throat)

00:13:13,851 --> 00:13:15,153
it's essentially...

00:13:15,153 --> 00:13:16,554
an app.

00:13:16,554 --> 00:13:18,589
You have to have
an access code.

00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:19,824
But once you're in,

00:13:19,824 --> 00:13:21,025
you can program whole floors,

00:13:21,025 --> 00:13:23,027
you can control
individual fixtures,

00:13:23,027 --> 00:13:24,162
whatever you need.

00:13:28,866 --> 00:13:30,702
So whoever
killed the lights

00:13:30,702 --> 00:13:32,070
should be in the system.

00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:34,706
Pretty much, he'd have to be.

00:13:34,706 --> 00:13:36,741
(chuckles)
That's a cute kid.

00:13:36,741 --> 00:13:38,042
How old is he?

00:13:38,042 --> 00:13:39,744
He's ten months old.

00:13:39,744 --> 00:13:40,945
So the real question is,

00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:43,147
who has the app?
Or the access codes?

00:13:43,147 --> 00:13:45,883
Besides me?
Uh... security department,

00:13:45,883 --> 00:13:47,719
hotel manager,
executive manager, I mean,
(phone ringing)

00:13:47,719 --> 00:13:49,454
just a handful of
people, probably.

00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:51,122
Well, we're gonna need a list.

00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:52,757
I don't have
that list.

00:13:52,757 --> 00:13:54,926
I mean, I set up the system,
but the hotel manager

00:13:54,926 --> 00:13:56,394
controls the access.

00:13:56,394 --> 00:13:58,529
SIDLE:
Morgan...

00:13:58,529 --> 00:14:00,865
Our missing poker player,
Rob Gentry, just turned up.

00:14:00,865 --> 00:14:04,535
He was at the Palermo Casino,
playing with Four Kings chips.

00:14:04,535 --> 00:14:06,437
Hm.

00:14:10,408 --> 00:14:13,010
STOKES:
Whoo! (chuckles)

00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:14,779
You had quite a night
last night,

00:14:14,779 --> 00:14:16,080
didn't you, Mr. Gentry?

00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:20,084
First you go all in
at the Rialto Room, lose,

00:14:20,084 --> 00:14:23,187
then you wind up
in this armed robbery.

00:14:23,187 --> 00:14:26,724
Yeah, I tell you,
whole thing was pretty crazy.

00:14:26,724 --> 00:14:27,959
I feel lucky just to be alive.

00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:29,160
Lucky? Oh, yeah.

00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,162
But you're also
a little stupid.

00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:33,498
Come on, you didn't think
we'd have every casino in town

00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:34,999
looking for these
Four Kings chips?

00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,601
And your dumb ass rolls

00:14:36,601 --> 00:14:39,904
into the Palermo today,
buys in with 75 grand worth.

00:14:39,904 --> 00:14:41,973
Where'd you get it?

00:14:41,973 --> 00:14:44,509
Well, you know,
I can't remember if I...

00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,010
if I won 'em or bought 'em.

00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,545
I've--I've had 'em
for quite a while.

00:14:51,048 --> 00:14:52,450
You see that?

00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:54,152
It's an RFID chip.

00:14:54,152 --> 00:14:55,887
Each one of these chips

00:14:55,887 --> 00:14:59,023
has its own digital
identification number.

00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:01,793
It helps the casino keep up
with chip movement.

00:15:01,793 --> 00:15:04,829
And these particular chips
were scanned last night

00:15:04,829 --> 00:15:07,965
as they were being put
on a cart for the Rialto Room.

00:15:07,965 --> 00:15:10,168
So the only way
that you could have them

00:15:10,168 --> 00:15:12,103
is if you stole them.
Wait.

00:15:12,103 --> 00:15:14,906
I had nothing to do
with that robbery.
Yes, you did, Robert.

00:15:14,906 --> 00:15:18,142
You and your motorcycle buddy?
We've got you on video

00:15:18,142 --> 00:15:21,112
texting him, giving him
the signal to strike.

00:15:21,112 --> 00:15:22,580
You're on the hook
for murder, bud.

00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,716
When that robbery went down,

00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:28,453
I--I ended up on the floor.
Suddenly,

00:15:28,453 --> 00:15:30,555
I'm face-to-face
with the chip cart.
So you just

00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:32,190
helped yourself to a handful,
is that it?

00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:34,926
I lost big
at the tables last night.

00:15:34,926 --> 00:15:36,461
It was just a way
to recoup a little.

00:15:36,461 --> 00:15:38,696
But I didn't
kill anybody.

00:15:38,696 --> 00:15:42,066
Look, maybe I can help you.

00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:44,101
Yeah? How's that?
Well, as...

00:15:44,101 --> 00:15:45,803
as I was slipping
out of there, I...

00:15:45,803 --> 00:15:47,872
I ducked into a service hallway
off the main casino.

00:15:47,872 --> 00:15:50,408
And I saw him,

00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:52,777
saw the guy in the motorcycle
gear running away.

00:15:52,777 --> 00:15:54,545
You know that's
in the opposite direction.

00:15:54,545 --> 00:15:56,581
Well, I--I'm just telling you
what I saw.

00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:01,052
Hey, we got to run this.

00:16:01,052 --> 00:16:04,188
New security footage from
the east side of the casino.

00:16:04,188 --> 00:16:07,091
You don't know how happy
that makes me. Of course...

00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,926
sets the stage
for greater disappointment.

00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,461
Not batting a thousand today?

00:16:10,461 --> 00:16:11,596
So far, no.

00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,602
Swing and a miss.

00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:19,937
Can I see that again?
It's just him running away.

00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,739
It doesn't help tie Gentry
to the robbery.

00:16:21,739 --> 00:16:23,641
Will you please replay it?

00:16:27,512 --> 00:16:29,714
I was just in autopsy.

00:16:29,714 --> 00:16:31,616
I saw Clint Tyree's X-rays.

00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:34,852
He has multiple healed
fractures and titanium posts.

00:16:34,852 --> 00:16:37,655
There is no way
that he could run like that.

00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:41,659
This boot belongs
to Clint Tyree,

00:16:41,659 --> 00:16:44,562
our stunt rider who died out
on Fremont Street.

00:16:44,562 --> 00:16:46,697
Check out
the wear pattern.

00:16:49,767 --> 00:16:52,937
Uneven on the outer heel, right?

00:16:52,937 --> 00:16:54,839
Guy probably had a limp.
Mm-hmm.

00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:57,742
From a lifetime
of motorcycle injuries.

00:16:57,742 --> 00:16:59,477
Now, look at this.

00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:00,745
Right after the robbery.

00:17:01,846 --> 00:17:03,581
(grunts)

00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:07,451
No limp.

00:17:07,451 --> 00:17:09,020
Not even close.
Mm-hmm.

00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,988
Now, enlarge the boot.

00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:13,558
(beeping)

00:17:13,558 --> 00:17:14,926
No wear pattern.

00:17:14,926 --> 00:17:16,894
It's a different boot.

00:17:16,894 --> 00:17:19,063
Two suspects,
identically dressed.

00:17:19,063 --> 00:17:21,499
One of them pulls off
the robbery,

00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:23,134
makes a run for it
down the hall...

00:17:23,134 --> 00:17:25,069
To where the other one
must've been waiting.

00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:29,974
<i>Tyree knows he's playing</i>
<i>the part of a decoy.</i>

00:17:29,974 --> 00:17:32,176
But he doesn't know
he's also the patsy.

00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:34,011
And right before he rides away,

00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,880
<i>he gets an unexpected</i>
<i>parting gift.</i>

00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,682
RUSSELL:
<i>The deadly injection.</i>

00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:39,483
(motorcycle roaring)

00:17:39,483 --> 00:17:41,786
The guy who hit
the Rialto Room

00:17:41,786 --> 00:17:44,589
is not the same guy
who died out on the street.

00:17:51,429 --> 00:17:53,397
Hey, Doc.

00:17:53,397 --> 00:17:56,834
Hear you got a C.O.D. for me
on our motorcycle rider here.

00:17:56,834 --> 00:17:58,603
Well, the C.O.D. was easy--

00:17:58,603 --> 00:18:00,104
the allergic reaction.

00:18:00,104 --> 00:18:01,872
The interesting part
is the cause.

00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:04,041
I was able
to identify the toxin

00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,611
that was injected
into Mr. Tyree's shoulder.

00:18:06,611 --> 00:18:09,413
An extremely
aggressive coagulant.

00:18:09,413 --> 00:18:12,083
This is an exemplar sample.

00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:14,619
Watch what happens
when I add a single drop

00:18:14,619 --> 00:18:17,421
into a beaker of blood.

00:18:22,927 --> 00:18:24,462
RUSSELL:
Wow, look at that.

00:18:24,462 --> 00:18:26,897
Massive clotting.
In just minutes,

00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:30,101
all the blood's clotting ability
is exhausted.

00:18:30,101 --> 00:18:33,137
And as a result, massive
internal bleeding occurs,

00:18:33,137 --> 00:18:35,873
in some cases leading
to total exsanguination.
But, now,

00:18:35,873 --> 00:18:38,409
we didn't see that
with Mr. Tyree here.

00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:41,178
No, because his allergy
to the toxin killed him first.

00:18:41,178 --> 00:18:43,514
Without the allergic reaction,
he would've been in

00:18:43,514 --> 00:18:45,583
for a slow
and very painful death.

00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:46,917
What was the toxin?

00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,419
Snake venom.

00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:50,888
A species called
<i>Daboia russelii,</i>

00:18:50,888 --> 00:18:53,658
commonly the Russell's viper.

00:18:53,658 --> 00:18:56,927
No relation, I'm assuming?
None that
I'm aware of.

00:18:56,927 --> 00:19:00,131
You said, without the allergy,
it would've been a slow death.

00:19:00,131 --> 00:19:03,534
But Mr. Tyree there was
a professional stunt rider.

00:19:03,534 --> 00:19:05,670
He could've led the cops
on a wild chase

00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:07,438
for who knows how long.

00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:10,041
But the allergy caused him to
drop in the first few minutes.

00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:12,476
Yeah, exactly.

00:19:12,476 --> 00:19:15,513
So maybe our real robber had
to change his plans.

00:19:15,513 --> 00:19:17,948
Right? Maybe he had
to do things a little faster.

00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:20,685
Thank you. Thanks.

00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,890
Well, you were right.
Within an hour of that robbery,

00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:28,025
we had every casino in town
looking for those chips,

00:19:28,025 --> 00:19:30,895
but we were too late--
he cashed 'em in immediately.

00:19:30,895 --> 00:19:33,531
So by the time
we sounded the alarm,

00:19:33,531 --> 00:19:35,066
chips were already
in a casino vault.

00:19:35,066 --> 00:19:37,568
Try six different casino vaults,

00:19:37,568 --> 00:19:39,537
all sister hotels
to the Four Kings.

00:19:39,537 --> 00:19:42,606
The Mediterranean
got a shot of our guy.

00:19:42,606 --> 00:19:44,575
There he is right there.

00:19:44,575 --> 00:19:45,776
With that disguise,

00:19:45,776 --> 00:19:47,745
it could be anybody.
Exactly.

00:19:47,745 --> 00:19:50,748
Hey, so I've been doing some
checking on the Russell's viper.

00:19:50,748 --> 00:19:52,116
Turns out this thing
is so dangerous

00:19:52,116 --> 00:19:53,851
it requires a permit
for ownership.

00:19:53,851 --> 00:19:55,453
Please tell me you found one.

00:19:55,453 --> 00:19:56,987
Right here in Vegas.

00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,889
Guy's name is Julian Reese.

00:19:58,889 --> 00:20:03,127
He's a valet car parker
for the Four Kings Casino.

00:20:03,127 --> 00:20:05,596
Another employee.

00:20:05,596 --> 00:20:07,865
Didn't show up to work today.
Brass already put a BOLO out.

00:20:07,865 --> 00:20:10,034
All right, I'll follow up.
See you later.
Okay.

00:20:10,034 --> 00:20:11,535
Yeah, that works and I'll...

00:20:11,535 --> 00:20:13,003
Akers.
Hey, Stokes.

00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:15,639
So parking enforcement
spotted the car.

00:20:15,639 --> 00:20:18,175
When the plates came back
to Julian Reese, they called us.

00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:21,712
When we found this,
we called you.

00:20:24,882 --> 00:20:26,083
Whew.

00:20:29,553 --> 00:20:31,789
Yeah, that's our snake charmer,
all right.

00:20:31,789 --> 00:20:33,991
Looks like he got it right here.

00:20:33,991 --> 00:20:35,693
Single shot
to the head.

00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:38,095
There's a small caliber casing
on the ground.

00:20:38,095 --> 00:20:39,797
There's also some bruising
on his face.

00:20:39,797 --> 00:20:41,165
Yeah, looks like
somebody beat him up

00:20:41,165 --> 00:20:42,733
pretty good.
And grabbed his shirt.

00:20:42,733 --> 00:20:44,168
There's a tear in it.

00:20:44,168 --> 00:20:45,903
Looks like there's
some residue or trace.

00:20:45,903 --> 00:20:47,605
We'll get it back to the lab.

00:20:47,605 --> 00:20:49,540
So that makes two
casino employees,

00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,041
the stunt rider
and the valet parker,

00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,877
both involved in the robbery.

00:20:54,645 --> 00:20:56,814
And both dead, which means

00:20:56,814 --> 00:20:58,816
there's at least one player left
in the game.

00:20:58,816 --> 00:21:01,085
Someone who I'm assuming
didn't want to share the money.

00:21:01,085 --> 00:21:03,087
AKERS: So then what was
this guy's part?

00:21:11,462 --> 00:21:15,166
Oh, I'd say he played
a starring role.

00:21:34,885 --> 00:21:36,153
Oh, hey.

00:21:36,153 --> 00:21:37,788
Uh, I'll start
with the good news.

00:21:37,788 --> 00:21:39,089
This...

00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:40,758
is definitely
your murder weapon.

00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:43,427
Venom from
the <i>Daboia russelii</i> viper.

00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:44,795
And I found DNA

00:21:44,795 --> 00:21:47,431
consistent with Clint Tyree
in the hypodermic tip.

00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:48,866
However, I've been

00:21:48,866 --> 00:21:51,569
less successful getting DNA
from the leathers.

00:21:51,569 --> 00:21:53,404
There was quite a bit
of perspiration inside,

00:21:53,404 --> 00:21:56,173
so I had high hopes
initially, but no luck yet.

00:21:56,173 --> 00:21:57,875
I'm taking
another crack at it,

00:21:57,875 --> 00:21:59,109
but for now,
I can't confirm

00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:00,878
that they were worn
by Julian Reese.

00:22:00,878 --> 00:22:02,813
What's with the orange color?
Yeah, I'm not sure.

00:22:02,813 --> 00:22:04,081
It might have something to do

00:22:04,081 --> 00:22:06,650
with the leather-tanning
process.

00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:08,619
Thought you might be
interested to know

00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:10,054
that I have identified the trace

00:22:10,054 --> 00:22:12,556
left in the snake charmer's
shirt lapels.

00:22:12,556 --> 00:22:14,024
Your residue looks to be pumice.

00:22:14,024 --> 00:22:15,459
Pumice?

00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:16,994
Oh, uh,
volcanic rock.

00:22:16,994 --> 00:22:19,597
Created when super-heated,
highly pressurized igneous rock

00:22:19,597 --> 00:22:21,799
is propelled from a volcano.

00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:23,868
Is there any reason
<i>I</i> couldn't have told her that?

00:22:23,868 --> 00:22:25,603
Guys, I know where
pumice comes from.

00:22:25,603 --> 00:22:26,871
Why would it be on his shirt?

00:22:26,871 --> 00:22:28,873
Well, it has many common uses.

00:22:28,873 --> 00:22:31,408
Such as lightweight concrete,
insulation,

00:22:31,408 --> 00:22:34,545
it's an additive in plaster and
it's even found in toothpaste.

00:22:34,545 --> 00:22:36,647
Hm. Is that it?

00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:42,119
No? If the pH is alkali,
that could indicate

00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:43,587
the presence of...
Soap.

00:22:45,623 --> 00:22:46,824
<i>Mechanic's soap.</i>

00:22:50,594 --> 00:22:51,829
Look, I can't be here.

00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:53,030
I just can't.

00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:54,798
Do you hear me?
I need you

00:22:54,798 --> 00:22:57,067
to sit in that chair now.

00:22:57,067 --> 00:22:58,869
But you don't understand
what you're doing.

00:22:58,869 --> 00:23:00,871
You don't know
what's going on.
SIDLE: Ryan,

00:23:00,871 --> 00:23:02,907
we found pumice
from your hand cleaner

00:23:02,907 --> 00:23:04,541
on Julian Reese's shirt.

00:23:04,541 --> 00:23:06,076
Do you want to tell us
how that got there?

00:23:06,076 --> 00:23:08,012
Look, I can explain everything.

00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:10,080
Okay? Just not now.

00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,017
I can't be here, all right?
Please.

00:23:13,017 --> 00:23:14,585
We got a warrant.

00:23:14,585 --> 00:23:16,053
We checked your
phone, okay?

00:23:16,053 --> 00:23:18,455
It was your access code
that shut down the lights

00:23:18,455 --> 00:23:19,857
in the Rialto Room
for the robbery.

00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:21,191
You were in on that heist.

00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,893
And...

00:23:22,893 --> 00:23:24,662
you shot Julian Reese

00:23:24,662 --> 00:23:26,830
so that you could have
all the money to yourself.

00:23:29,566 --> 00:23:31,435
Fine, okay, don't talk.

00:23:31,435 --> 00:23:33,103
We're in your home right now,

00:23:33,103 --> 00:23:34,905
turning it upside down,
and we're gonna find

00:23:34,905 --> 00:23:37,107
the proof that we need.

00:23:39,843 --> 00:23:42,680
Well, no sign of the money.

00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,981
And there's no evidence

00:23:43,981 --> 00:23:45,950
of a female living
in the house, either.

00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:47,518
I think he divorced the wife.

00:23:47,518 --> 00:23:49,987
No divorce. She died.

00:23:49,987 --> 00:23:51,956
From cancer.

00:23:51,956 --> 00:23:55,192
These are all
condolence cards.

00:23:55,192 --> 00:23:58,395
These are all medical bills.

00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:00,397
Poor kid just
loses his mother.

00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:03,767
Now he's gonna lose
his father too.

00:24:03,767 --> 00:24:04,969
Morgan...

00:24:04,969 --> 00:24:06,103
you gotta check this out.

00:24:11,675 --> 00:24:12,943
(phone auto-dialing)

00:24:12,943 --> 00:24:14,778
(sighs)

00:24:14,778 --> 00:24:16,747
Sara...

00:24:16,747 --> 00:24:18,582
this whole thing
just went sideways.

00:24:21,452 --> 00:24:22,653
(phone beeps off)

00:24:25,489 --> 00:24:26,924
We know what happened.

00:24:26,924 --> 00:24:28,525
They kidnapped your son.

00:24:30,694 --> 00:24:33,097
Yeah, now thanks to you,
they're gonna kill him.

00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:40,404
So what we're gonna do
is just keep you in here.

00:24:40,404 --> 00:24:42,606
We figure the best thing
for you to do is

00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:44,675
stay inside, in case
they try to contact you.

00:24:44,675 --> 00:24:46,543
Now, all our boys
are gonna be here.

00:24:46,543 --> 00:24:48,679
We're gonna have taps
on the phone...

00:24:48,679 --> 00:24:50,881
No, no, no, no, no--this is
exactly what I didn't want.

00:24:50,881 --> 00:24:52,750
Hey!
They said no police.

00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,618
If whoever has Christopher
is watching,

00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:57,121
who knows what
they'll do to him!
Hey, listen,

00:24:57,121 --> 00:24:59,189
man, there's a lot of people
here working really hard

00:24:59,189 --> 00:25:01,158
to help you find your boy,
and we're gonna do that,

00:25:01,158 --> 00:25:03,627
but we can't do it
unless you cooperate.

00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:04,995
Okay? Sit down,

00:25:04,995 --> 00:25:06,930
tell me how you got
into all this mess.

00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:08,399
Come on, let's sit down.

00:25:11,835 --> 00:25:13,504
About, uh, two months ago,

00:25:13,504 --> 00:25:15,606
Julian approached me
in the employee cafeteria.

00:25:15,606 --> 00:25:18,108
Julian...Reese,
the valet dude?
He came to me
and said that there

00:25:18,108 --> 00:25:21,612
was a couple other people who
had come up with a plan, a way
to get rich off the casino.

00:25:21,612 --> 00:25:23,414
What other people?
He didn't name names.
And to be

00:25:23,414 --> 00:25:25,182
really honest, I didn't
take him that seriously.

00:25:25,182 --> 00:25:27,051
I mean, we see
so much money that

00:25:27,051 --> 00:25:28,852
comes through here every day...
I mean, and everybody's

00:25:28,852 --> 00:25:30,888
fantasizing about how
they can get some of it.

00:25:30,888 --> 00:25:33,524
Right.
But I just told him no thanks,
that I wasn't interested,

00:25:33,524 --> 00:25:35,526
not while I have Christopher
to worry about.

00:25:35,526 --> 00:25:37,461
(watch alarm beeping)

00:25:37,461 --> 00:25:39,396
What's with the alarm, man?

00:25:39,396 --> 00:25:41,565
I--I...got to take a pill.
Yeah? Let me see that.

00:25:44,034 --> 00:25:47,004
Rifampin?
What do you take these for?

00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:49,740
Christopher's nanny, one of
the kids got meningitis,

00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,608
so now we're all taking
it as a precaution.

00:25:51,608 --> 00:25:54,144
Yeah, okay.
So what did Julian say

00:25:54,144 --> 00:25:55,846
when you told him
you weren't interested

00:25:55,846 --> 00:25:58,015
in his plan?

00:25:58,015 --> 00:25:59,716
He just said
it was no big deal,

00:25:59,716 --> 00:26:02,052
that that was cool...
and that was the end of it.

00:26:02,052 --> 00:26:05,422
Until yesterday morning.

00:26:05,422 --> 00:26:07,124
I went in...

00:26:07,124 --> 00:26:09,093
to take a shower
while Christopher was sleeping.

00:26:09,093 --> 00:26:10,627
I mean, it couldn't have been

00:26:10,627 --> 00:26:12,463
more than two or three minutes
at the most.

00:26:12,463 --> 00:26:15,032
And when I came back out,
he was gone.

00:26:15,032 --> 00:26:17,101
And he wrote that note
on my laptop.
"Keep quiet,

00:26:17,101 --> 00:26:19,470
do what we ask,
and you'll get your kid back."
And I went

00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:21,105
and I confronted
him at work.
Did you get physical with him?

00:26:21,105 --> 00:26:23,407
Yeah, yeah, I admit it,
I lost my temper.

00:26:23,407 --> 00:26:25,042
I hit him,
but I didn't kill him!

00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:26,910
All right?

00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:28,846
He said he didn't know
where Christopher was,

00:26:28,846 --> 00:26:30,781
and that I should just go along,

00:26:30,781 --> 00:26:33,650
and that I should just shut off
the lights in the Rialto Room.

00:26:36,854 --> 00:26:39,890
But I did everything they asked.

00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:42,159
Where is he?

00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,528
Where's my son?

00:26:44,528 --> 00:26:45,929
We're gonna
get him back for you.

00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:00,811
You know,
when I was taken...

00:27:00,811 --> 00:27:01,945
when I was being held...

00:27:04,882 --> 00:27:07,618
...at least I knew
you guys were looking for me.

00:27:11,188 --> 00:27:13,991
This little baby...

00:27:13,991 --> 00:27:15,959
what is <i>he</i> thinking?

00:27:15,959 --> 00:27:18,061
He's in a weird
place with...

00:27:18,061 --> 00:27:20,063
without his father.

00:27:20,063 --> 00:27:23,867
Yeah...kid cases
are always tough.

00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:28,805
Thing is...

00:27:28,805 --> 00:27:30,741
whoever took him...

00:27:30,741 --> 00:27:32,910
they already got
what they wanted.

00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:34,745
They have no use
for him now.

00:27:34,745 --> 00:27:36,947
Morgan, do you really
want to go there?
Why not?

00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:39,016
They've already shown they
have no trouble killing.

00:27:39,016 --> 00:27:40,484
What's one more?

00:27:40,484 --> 00:27:42,753
Yeah, but this is a baby.

00:27:42,753 --> 00:27:45,055
And you just have
to hope that

00:27:45,055 --> 00:27:47,524
it's...somehow different.

00:27:49,092 --> 00:27:50,694
(quietly):
Yeah.

00:27:54,531 --> 00:27:56,600
(crying softly)

00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,702
(sniffles, sobs)

00:28:01,672 --> 00:28:03,874
(sniffles, sobs)

00:28:05,175 --> 00:28:07,644
(continues sobbing)

00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:10,614
Sorry.

00:28:10,614 --> 00:28:11,848
What's wrong with me?

00:28:11,848 --> 00:28:13,016
Hey...

00:28:15,452 --> 00:28:17,921
You're only human.

00:28:17,921 --> 00:28:19,122
(quietly):
Thanks.

00:28:19,122 --> 00:28:21,725
(sniffles)

00:28:24,027 --> 00:28:25,529
Let's check outside.

00:28:25,529 --> 00:28:26,863
Father said he was
only in the shower

00:28:26,863 --> 00:28:29,433
for a few minutes;
maybe the kidnapper

00:28:29,433 --> 00:28:31,969
was waiting there,
watching...

00:28:31,969 --> 00:28:33,971
for the perfect
time to strike.

00:28:33,971 --> 00:28:35,572
We got to find this kid.

00:28:47,117 --> 00:28:48,518
SANDERS:
Oh, yeah.

00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:49,786
Someone was definitely here,

00:28:49,786 --> 00:28:51,021
in this spot.

00:28:51,021 --> 00:28:53,090
You can see
his shoe impressions.

00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:56,526
BRODY:
Perfect view of the hallway

00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:58,028
towards the bathroom door.

00:28:58,028 --> 00:29:00,597
Kidnapper could have seen Ryan
heading to the bathroom

00:29:00,597 --> 00:29:01,732
to take a shower.

00:29:04,968 --> 00:29:06,136
What's this?

00:29:08,572 --> 00:29:11,575
Hey, get a shot of that.

00:29:11,575 --> 00:29:13,076
(shutter clicks)

00:29:13,076 --> 00:29:15,145
Some kind of coin.
It could have

00:29:15,145 --> 00:29:18,448
fallen out of someone's pocket,
if they were crouched down here.

00:29:18,448 --> 00:29:20,984
SANDERS: Well, it's definitely
not U.S. currency.

00:29:20,984 --> 00:29:22,653
I don't know--
how's your Arabic?

00:29:22,653 --> 00:29:25,889
My Arabic's crap.

00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:27,691
But my Pashto's not bad.

00:29:27,691 --> 00:29:29,059
Pashto?

00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:30,761
Like Afghanistan?

00:29:30,761 --> 00:29:32,396
Yeah.

00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:34,998
Well, our first victim,
the security guard,

00:29:34,998 --> 00:29:37,834
his wife said that he did
four tours in Afghanistan.

00:29:37,834 --> 00:29:40,470
You're thinking
our innocent victim

00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:42,839
wasn't so innocent after all.

00:29:42,839 --> 00:29:46,043
So Paul Brantson
was far from an angel.

00:29:46,043 --> 00:29:48,945
He left the military
with a bad-conduct discharge.

00:29:48,945 --> 00:29:50,881
Apparently, he was
trying to smuggle

00:29:50,881 --> 00:29:52,883
more than a coin
out of Afghanistan.

00:29:52,883 --> 00:29:54,918
I checked the security
schedule at the casino.

00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:57,187
Mm-hmm.
He wasn't even supposed
to be working last night.

00:29:57,187 --> 00:29:59,423
Really?
He traded shifts
to be in the room.

00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:02,192
So it was no accident
he was there.

00:30:02,192 --> 00:30:04,961
I just processed
the security guard's car.

00:30:04,961 --> 00:30:08,799
Fibers found in the backseat
are a match to the baby's crib.

00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,967
There's also traces
of zinc oxide.

00:30:10,967 --> 00:30:12,769
Diaper paste.

00:30:21,678 --> 00:30:23,747
Why won't anybody tell me
what's going on?

00:30:23,747 --> 00:30:26,183
My husband's dead,
I'm trying to plan a funeral,

00:30:26,183 --> 00:30:29,519
and your people storm
into my house and start
tearing it apart without even

00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:31,054
an explanation!
Ms. Brantson....

00:30:31,054 --> 00:30:33,056
please...

00:30:33,056 --> 00:30:34,191
take a seat.

00:30:38,061 --> 00:30:39,563
(sighs)

00:30:44,701 --> 00:30:46,636
Do you recognize this?

00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:48,638
It's an Afghani coin.

00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:50,941
Yeah. It's Paul's.

00:30:52,843 --> 00:30:54,578
He always carried it
with him to remind him

00:30:54,578 --> 00:30:57,481
of all the guys who
weren't as lucky as he was,

00:30:57,481 --> 00:30:59,916
the guys who
didn't make it back.

00:30:59,916 --> 00:31:02,052
The problem is, we found it
outside of the house

00:31:02,052 --> 00:31:03,687
where a young baby
was kidnapped.

00:31:03,687 --> 00:31:07,457
Well, then obviously
it's <i>not</i> Paul's.

00:31:07,457 --> 00:31:08,825
It just looks like
the one he carried.

00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:10,394
Except his fingerprint
was on it.

00:31:10,394 --> 00:31:12,629
And when we
searched his car,

00:31:12,629 --> 00:31:15,098
we found evidence that a baby

00:31:15,098 --> 00:31:16,600
had recently been
in the backseat.

00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,069
No, no, this is insane.

00:31:19,069 --> 00:31:21,571
There's no way Paul
was part of a kidnapping.

00:31:21,571 --> 00:31:26,643
Do you know where your husband
was at 7:30 yesterday morning?

00:31:26,643 --> 00:31:27,911
You know what?

00:31:27,911 --> 00:31:30,447
I'm not doing this with you.

00:31:30,447 --> 00:31:31,782
I just lost my husband,

00:31:31,782 --> 00:31:33,784
and I haven't even
been able to bury him yet.

00:31:33,784 --> 00:31:36,186
I am very sorry for
your loss, but right now,

00:31:36,186 --> 00:31:37,854
we are focused on
finding that baby.

00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:39,723
So if you know
something,

00:31:39,723 --> 00:31:41,925
or if there's anything
you want to tell us...
No, no.

00:31:41,925 --> 00:31:43,493
I'm not talking to you anymore.

00:31:43,493 --> 00:31:45,162
I'm not speaking
to anyone,

00:31:45,162 --> 00:31:47,397
except <i>maybe</i> a lawyer.

00:31:52,903 --> 00:31:55,972
RUSSELL:
Okay, we've got at least
four employees from the casino--

00:31:55,972 --> 00:31:59,009
the stunt driver, valet parker,

00:31:59,009 --> 00:32:01,545
security guard...

00:32:01,545 --> 00:32:03,680
and the maintenance worker.

00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:08,118
These three all presumably
part of the robbery crew,

00:32:08,118 --> 00:32:11,621
all killed during
or after the heist.

00:32:11,621 --> 00:32:13,423
Well, so much
for honor among thieves.

00:32:13,423 --> 00:32:15,158
RUSSELL:
Let me ask you something.

00:32:15,158 --> 00:32:17,027
Why not kill
the maintenance worker?

00:32:17,027 --> 00:32:18,728
Why is Ryan still alive?

00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:20,664
'Cause he doesn't pose a threat.

00:32:20,664 --> 00:32:22,532
He didn't even know
who the main players were,

00:32:22,532 --> 00:32:23,900
except for the valet guy.

00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,936
And he wasn't in for
a share of the spoils.

00:32:25,936 --> 00:32:29,172
Well, we know we have at least
one more player out there--

00:32:29,172 --> 00:32:32,776
whoever shot Julian Reese
and took the money.
Good chance

00:32:32,776 --> 00:32:35,779
it's another Four Kings
employee, but there are
over 400 of them,

00:32:35,779 --> 00:32:38,448
so it's gonna take time
to run them down.

00:32:38,448 --> 00:32:40,617
Which we don't have--
that baby's been out there

00:32:40,617 --> 00:32:42,052
for more than 36 hours.

00:32:42,052 --> 00:32:44,087
Hey, guys, just got
a call from Akers.

00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:45,655
Ryan Archer is gone.

00:32:48,859 --> 00:32:50,560
Officer Akers!

00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,062
What the hell
happened here?

00:32:52,062 --> 00:32:53,864
Captain, he was only out of
my sight for a couple of min--

00:32:53,864 --> 00:32:55,565
Why was he out of
your sight at all?

00:32:55,565 --> 00:32:56,733
H--he said he needed
to use the bathroom.

00:32:56,733 --> 00:32:58,401
I went to check on him...

00:32:58,401 --> 00:33:00,837
Damn it, Akers, you had one
job to do, just one job.

00:33:00,837 --> 00:33:03,740
You were to sit on this guy,
and keep an eye on him.

00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:06,109
That's it, one job!
Jim, come on,
man, chill out.

00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:08,445
Shut up, Stokes.
Don't tell me what to do.

00:33:08,445 --> 00:33:10,180
You, get out of here.

00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:12,816
Captain...
they contacted him.

00:33:12,816 --> 00:33:14,451
We've been monitoring
his phone.

00:33:14,451 --> 00:33:15,952
This is an e-mail.

00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:18,655
"This is your last chance.

00:33:18,655 --> 00:33:21,124
Meet at the employee
parking lot, level four."

00:33:22,592 --> 00:33:25,729
He's gonna get his kid.

00:33:25,729 --> 00:33:28,031
No, he's gonna get
himself killed.

00:33:37,173 --> 00:33:38,875
I don't see him.
I think we're too late.

00:33:38,875 --> 00:33:40,010
I don't see him, either.

00:33:44,614 --> 00:33:45,815
Nick!

00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:47,417
Ryan?

00:33:47,417 --> 00:33:49,019
What happened?

00:33:49,019 --> 00:33:51,021
I've done it. I've lost him.
I'll never see him now.

00:33:51,021 --> 00:33:52,789
All right, calm down.
Is this your blood?

00:33:52,789 --> 00:33:54,024
Are you hurt?
It's not my blood.

00:33:54,024 --> 00:33:55,759
It just went off.
I didn't mean to.

00:33:55,759 --> 00:33:57,861
What went off?
I was just sitting
in the car, waiting.

00:33:57,861 --> 00:33:59,396
Next thing you know, somebody
comes up to my blind spot.

00:33:59,396 --> 00:34:00,697
Suddenly, a gun was
at my head.

00:34:00,697 --> 00:34:02,065
And as I was trying
to get out, I mean,

00:34:02,065 --> 00:34:03,400
I guess the gun went off.

00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,101
BRODY:
Nick...I got a body.

00:34:06,703 --> 00:34:08,138
It's the dealer
from the card room.

00:34:08,138 --> 00:34:09,806
No pulse.

00:34:09,806 --> 00:34:11,608
She's dead.
No, no. No.

00:34:11,608 --> 00:34:13,777
She was the one person
who knew where Christopher was.

00:34:13,777 --> 00:34:15,011
Charlie-05, I got a 187.

00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,413
Send backup, code three.

00:34:16,413 --> 00:34:18,114
You better start
talking to me, Ryan!

00:34:18,114 --> 00:34:19,883
I got keys.

00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:24,988
(car alarm beeping)

00:34:24,988 --> 00:34:26,957
Over this way.

00:34:26,957 --> 00:34:28,458
You stay with me!
Stay with me!

00:34:29,926 --> 00:34:31,595
(alarm chirps off)

00:34:34,397 --> 00:34:35,599
(crying)

00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:36,900
I got the baby.

00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,635
Christopher! Oh, my God.
Oh, no, no, no.

00:34:38,635 --> 00:34:40,937
Stay back, Ryan.
There's no way

00:34:40,937 --> 00:34:43,640
I'm gonna let you touch him,
and you're covered in blood.
It's my son.

00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,609
Look, the important thing is
that he's okay, see?

00:34:45,609 --> 00:34:47,177
He's okay.
There's Daddy.
Yeah, okay.

00:34:47,177 --> 00:34:48,745
We'll get him to the hospital,
we'll get you

00:34:48,745 --> 00:34:50,046
to the hospital, we'll
get him checked out.

00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,715
It's gonna be okay.

00:34:51,715 --> 00:34:53,183
You're okay, buddy.
Daddy's right here, okay?

00:34:53,183 --> 00:34:55,852
Just get his Bun-Bun, all right?
Okay.

00:34:55,852 --> 00:34:58,888
It's gonna make him feel better.
Yeah, we'll do that;
we'll get his Bun-Bun.

00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:01,091
Come on, let's go over here.
Come on, now.

00:35:01,091 --> 00:35:03,793
You're okay.

00:35:03,793 --> 00:35:07,163
Our dead poker dealer, Audrey--
just came from her house.

00:35:07,163 --> 00:35:08,798
She's got all kinds
of kids stuff.

00:35:08,798 --> 00:35:11,868
She's got toys, food,
a makeshift crib.

00:35:11,868 --> 00:35:14,537
Looks like she was gonna
keep that kid for the long haul.

00:35:14,537 --> 00:35:17,073
Also found
this disposable phone.

00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:19,042
In it was the text
signaling Ryan

00:35:19,042 --> 00:35:20,610
to turn off the lights.

00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:23,013
So she was the eyes
in the poker room.

00:35:23,013 --> 00:35:24,547
Okay...

00:35:24,547 --> 00:35:26,082
the gun we recovered

00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:28,852
next to the dealer's dead body
belonged to her.

00:35:28,852 --> 00:35:30,587
Greg just ran
ballistics.

00:35:30,587 --> 00:35:32,455
It's the gun
that killed Reese in his car.

00:35:32,455 --> 00:35:34,958
So what are we thinking,
that she's the mastermind,

00:35:34,958 --> 00:35:37,060
the femme fatale,
the one who seduced

00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:39,696
the other three into
executing her plan?

00:35:39,696 --> 00:35:41,965
Oh, way she looked,
it wouldn't have been that hard.

00:35:41,965 --> 00:35:43,566
Is this it?

00:35:43,566 --> 00:35:45,502
Is this really

00:35:45,502 --> 00:35:47,404
the whole team?

00:35:48,805 --> 00:35:52,709
No...no, we can't.

00:35:52,709 --> 00:35:54,678
Where's the money?

00:35:57,414 --> 00:35:59,482
Hey.

00:35:59,482 --> 00:36:01,785
Oh, that's not a late-night
snack, I'm guessing.

00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:03,653
No, I just came
from the hospital.

00:36:03,653 --> 00:36:06,423
They belong to the baby that
was kidnapped and his father.

00:36:06,423 --> 00:36:07,791
We looking
for anything specific?

00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:09,592
Well, let's start with

00:36:09,592 --> 00:36:12,796
where the baby was and who he
might have had contact with.

00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:20,670
Oh, try to preserve that
the best you can.

00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:22,138
It's special
to the kid.
Oh.

00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:24,441
Yeah, it's funny
how babies do that,

00:36:24,441 --> 00:36:27,077
fixate on one particular toy.

00:36:27,077 --> 00:36:30,880
When I was a baby, mine was
an elephant called "Stinky."

00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,882
Guess I carried him around
in my mouth a lot.

00:36:32,882 --> 00:36:35,018
He was always moist.

00:36:35,018 --> 00:36:38,588
Moist means bacteria,
which leads to stinky.

00:36:38,588 --> 00:36:41,024
Henry, look at this.

00:36:41,024 --> 00:36:42,492
It looks like sweat stains,

00:36:42,492 --> 00:36:44,494
the pattern, at least,
but the color...

00:36:44,494 --> 00:36:48,131
It's orange.
Just like the tint that came
off the motorcycle leathers.

00:36:48,131 --> 00:36:49,733
It wasn't
from the tanning process.

00:36:49,733 --> 00:36:51,434
It's from the perspiration.

00:36:51,434 --> 00:36:52,869
Chromhidrosis--

00:36:52,869 --> 00:36:54,404
colored sweat.

00:36:54,404 --> 00:36:56,005
It's a rare condition
on its own.

00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:58,007
More often, it's a side effect
of something else.

00:36:58,007 --> 00:37:00,009
Like copper miners
can sweat blue

00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:01,511
from the minerals
in the mine.

00:37:01,511 --> 00:37:03,079
What about this?
What about orange?

00:37:03,079 --> 00:37:04,981
Could be a pharmaceutical
side effect.

00:37:04,981 --> 00:37:06,916
Is this baby taking
any medication?

00:37:15,058 --> 00:37:16,459
Oh, finally.

00:37:16,459 --> 00:37:17,727
(laughs)
Doctor said

00:37:17,727 --> 00:37:19,729
everything looks good.

00:37:19,729 --> 00:37:21,631
There's nothing
to worry about.

00:37:21,631 --> 00:37:23,600
Thought I might never get
to hold him again.

00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,102
No one's happier than me
to see this reunion.

00:37:28,438 --> 00:37:31,407
I've been so obsessed
with the loss of my wife,

00:37:31,407 --> 00:37:32,709
I haven't focused enough on him.

00:37:34,911 --> 00:37:36,112
You did the best you could.

00:37:38,615 --> 00:37:40,049
How's your son,
Mr. Archer?

00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:41,885
Seems to be doing fine.

00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:43,853
Doctors said
he checked out okay.

00:37:43,853 --> 00:37:46,022
I guess the kidnappers took
pretty good care of him then.

00:37:46,022 --> 00:37:47,524
Fed him,
changed his diaper,

00:37:47,524 --> 00:37:50,093
gave him his medication.

00:37:50,093 --> 00:37:52,595
Your son is on rifampin,
right?

00:37:52,595 --> 00:37:53,797
You both are?

00:37:53,797 --> 00:37:55,899
What's going on, Sara?

00:37:55,899 --> 00:37:58,568
Well, the hospital ran blood
tests on Christopher tonight,

00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:00,136
and his rifampin
level suggested he had

00:38:00,136 --> 00:38:01,805
a dose about ten hours ago.

00:38:01,805 --> 00:38:04,007
Would you like
to explain to me

00:38:04,007 --> 00:38:06,109
how the kidnappers knew
to give him his medication?

00:38:13,116 --> 00:38:14,884
SIDLE:
<i>Well done, Mr. Archer.</i>

00:38:14,884 --> 00:38:18,154
You played us, you played
the sympathy card with your son.

00:38:18,154 --> 00:38:20,723
You had us all believing that
you were one of the victims.

00:38:20,723 --> 00:38:23,026
Not bad.
Look, I don't
care what you say.

00:38:23,026 --> 00:38:25,995
I didn't kidnap my own son.

00:38:25,995 --> 00:38:28,464
It was that security guard,
just like you said.

00:38:28,464 --> 00:38:30,867
They took Christopher to force
me to be part of their plan.

00:38:30,867 --> 00:38:32,702
That's what you
wanted us to think.

00:38:32,702 --> 00:38:34,037
But it was you

00:38:34,037 --> 00:38:36,973
who planted the Afghani coin
in your garden,

00:38:36,973 --> 00:38:39,943
and it was you who put the
diaper paste in his backseat.

00:38:39,943 --> 00:38:41,477
My God, you make me out to be

00:38:41,477 --> 00:38:42,779
like I'm this
criminal mastermind

00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:44,480
with this crazy plan.

00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,882
I just did what I had to do!

00:38:45,882 --> 00:38:47,884
I turned off the lights.
That's all.

00:38:47,884 --> 00:38:49,085
FINLAY:
That is not all.

00:38:49,085 --> 00:38:50,587
Not even close.

00:38:50,587 --> 00:38:52,856
This, uh, medication
you're on, rifampin,

00:38:52,856 --> 00:38:54,657
has an interesting side effect.

00:38:54,657 --> 00:38:56,659
It's called chromhidrosis.

00:38:56,659 --> 00:38:58,761
Causes colored sweat.

00:38:58,761 --> 00:39:00,897
Your baby's sweat is orange,
your sweat is orange.

00:39:00,897 --> 00:39:02,899
Haven't you noticed?

00:39:02,899 --> 00:39:04,601
We've only been taking it
a couple days.

00:39:04,601 --> 00:39:05,835
Does it really matter?
Yeah.

00:39:05,835 --> 00:39:07,937
Yeah, it matters.

00:39:07,937 --> 00:39:09,939
That's you.

00:39:09,939 --> 00:39:11,908
You were sweating
when you robbed the card room.

00:39:11,908 --> 00:39:15,178
<i>You were sweating</i>
<i>when you shot Paul Brantson.</i>

00:39:15,178 --> 00:39:17,113
<i>Injecting Clint Tyree</i>
<i>with snake venom--</i>

00:39:17,113 --> 00:39:19,682
<i>that made you</i>
<i>sweat too, right?</i>

00:39:19,682 --> 00:39:21,651
FINLAY:
And then, after the robbery,

00:39:21,651 --> 00:39:23,853
you went
and you killed Julian Reese,

00:39:23,853 --> 00:39:26,890
and then you stashed
the motorcycle leathers
and the syringe

00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:28,892
in his car,
hoping that we'd think

00:39:28,892 --> 00:39:30,860
that Reese was the gunman.

00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:32,462
SIDLE:
There was only one problem.

00:39:32,462 --> 00:39:34,731
Those motorcycle leathers
absorbed a lot of sweat--

00:39:34,731 --> 00:39:37,433
orange sweat--
when I compared them

00:39:37,433 --> 00:39:39,836
to the shirt that I took
from you tonight, guess what?

00:39:39,836 --> 00:39:41,971
They were a perfect match,
right down

00:39:41,971 --> 00:39:43,940
to identical traces
of rifampin.

00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:46,442
FINLAY: So that puts you
in the leathers, Ryan.

00:39:46,442 --> 00:39:48,044
You're our guy.

00:39:48,044 --> 00:39:51,948
You robbed the Rialto Room,
and you killed four people.

00:39:58,655 --> 00:39:59,856
I didn't do it for me.

00:39:59,856 --> 00:40:01,524
SIDLE:
Oh, let me guess.

00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:03,626
This is the part where you argue
for father of the year.

00:40:03,626 --> 00:40:06,029
Chris was five months old
when my wife died.

00:40:06,029 --> 00:40:07,630
Do you have any idea

00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:09,432
the amount of medical bills
she left behind?

00:40:09,432 --> 00:40:11,467
So you killed four people
to pay them?

00:40:11,467 --> 00:40:13,870
So much money
goes through that place.

00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:15,672
I mean, just a handful

00:40:15,672 --> 00:40:17,874
of chips would have changed
everything for me and Chris.

00:40:20,443 --> 00:40:23,980
I mean, just think how
I could have raised him.

00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:25,982
Yeah, how are you going
to raise him now?

00:40:25,982 --> 00:40:28,952
(crying)

00:40:28,952 --> 00:40:30,553
(sighs)

00:40:35,425 --> 00:40:37,827
Hey, man.
Hey, you got a second?

00:40:37,827 --> 00:40:39,028
Yeah, sure. What's up?

00:40:39,028 --> 00:40:41,130
(sighs)

00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:43,633
I owe you an apology.

00:40:43,633 --> 00:40:45,034
(chuckles)
For what?

00:40:45,034 --> 00:40:47,036
For jumping on you
and jumping on Akers.

00:40:47,036 --> 00:40:49,605
I talked to Akers, and now I'm
talking to you--I'm sorry.

00:40:49,605 --> 00:40:52,141
Jim, I get it.

00:40:52,141 --> 00:40:54,644
You got a lot going on
right now, okay?

00:40:54,644 --> 00:40:56,546
Yeah, I got a lot
going on, yeah.

00:40:56,546 --> 00:40:58,181
The D.A.'s calling me.

00:40:58,181 --> 00:41:01,784
The prosecutor wants to talk
to me about testifying against

00:41:01,784 --> 00:41:03,119
my daughter.

00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:04,520
Yeah, I mean,
I'm on the phone

00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,422
six or seven times
a day to New Jersey,

00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:08,791
handling my
ex-wife's affairs.

00:41:08,791 --> 00:41:13,162
Come on, everything will be back
to normal eventually.

00:41:13,162 --> 00:41:14,630
You know that.

00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:16,432
Back to normal--
I'd like that.

00:41:18,568 --> 00:41:21,037
But I'll tell you, Nick, the way
my life's going right now,

00:41:21,037 --> 00:41:23,506
I don't know what normal is.

00:41:28,778 --> 00:41:30,113
(footsteps approaching)

00:41:30,113 --> 00:41:31,714
Hey.

00:41:31,714 --> 00:41:33,416
Hey.

00:41:33,416 --> 00:41:34,650
Just got
off the phone with Greg.

00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:35,985
They found the money

00:41:35,985 --> 00:41:38,554
in a maintenance locker
at the casino.

00:41:41,057 --> 00:41:42,825
Good.

00:41:42,825 --> 00:41:43,960
Sit down.

00:41:51,067 --> 00:41:52,702
I just wish
we could take the money,

00:41:52,702 --> 00:41:55,071
you know, put it in a trust
for that poor kid.

00:41:57,006 --> 00:41:58,141
That'd be nice.

00:42:02,178 --> 00:42:05,448
Well, kids are resilient.

00:42:05,448 --> 00:42:08,584
Maybe he'll be all right.

00:42:08,584 --> 00:42:10,586
What about you?

00:42:10,586 --> 00:42:12,155
You gonna be all right?

00:42:16,859 --> 00:42:18,694
Time heals all, right?

00:42:22,131 --> 00:42:24,634
I guess we'll find out
if that's true.

00:42:29,072 --> 00:42:30,673
Have a good night.

00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:32,608
You too.
