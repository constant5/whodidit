00:00:02,824 --> 00:00:07,328
WOMAN:
<i>Once upon a time, there was</i>
<i>a reindeer named Winston.</i>

00:00:07,328 --> 00:00:08,830
(bells jingling)

00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:10,898
<i>Winston was lost.</i>

00:00:10,898 --> 00:00:14,902
<i>He wandered the city instead of</i>
<i>delivering toys in the frost.</i>

00:00:14,902 --> 00:00:17,271
(camera shutters clicking)

00:00:17,271 --> 00:00:19,407
Did you get it?
(reindeer grunts)

00:00:19,407 --> 00:00:21,676
<i>Winston searched</i>
<i>every roof and chimney.</i>

00:00:21,676 --> 00:00:23,378
(women gasping)

00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:27,682
<i>Where, oh, where</i>
<i>could jolly Santa be?</i>

00:00:38,626 --> 00:00:41,929
(siren wails in distance)

00:00:41,929 --> 00:00:44,365
Thank you.

00:00:44,365 --> 00:00:45,366
(heavy sigh)

00:00:45,366 --> 00:00:47,235
BRASS:
Happy holidays.

00:00:47,235 --> 00:00:49,437
RUSSELL:
Not for Santa, I hear.
BRASS: There's gonna be

00:00:49,437 --> 00:00:50,705
a lot of disappointed kids

00:00:50,705 --> 00:00:52,440
this year.

00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,642
RUSSELL:
Wow. Snow in Vegas.

00:00:54,642 --> 00:00:57,011
Well, this White Christmas
is brought to you courtesy of

00:00:57,011 --> 00:00:59,313
the Winter Wonderland Company--
the employee Jayson Walt,

00:00:59,313 --> 00:01:00,348
he's over there.

00:01:00,348 --> 00:01:02,583
Reindeer wrangler,
snowmaker,

00:01:02,583 --> 00:01:04,719
jack-of-all-trades.
He comes to work this morning,

00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:06,654
finds a dead Santa
and a missing reindeer.

00:01:06,654 --> 00:01:08,456
They went all out.

00:01:08,456 --> 00:01:11,225
Patrol found Dasher about
an hour ago on the Strip,

00:01:11,225 --> 00:01:12,860
blood in his fur.
Animal Control

00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,430
brought him here, and Jayson
Walt identified him as Dasher.

00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:17,865
David Phillips has
the I.D. on the dead guy.

00:01:17,865 --> 00:01:18,966
Good luck.

00:01:22,437 --> 00:01:23,704
David,

00:01:23,704 --> 00:01:25,640
got a name yet?
Lucky for us

00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,476
the victim is not
a Secret Santa.

00:01:28,476 --> 00:01:30,244
He's got business cards,
everything.

00:01:31,779 --> 00:01:35,983
"Brad Fante--your friendly
neighborhood I.T. guy."

00:01:35,983 --> 00:01:37,752
Works for Bonham Realty.

00:01:37,752 --> 00:01:39,587
Must have been
the company Kringle.

00:01:39,587 --> 00:01:41,722
Liver temp tells me
he died between

00:01:41,722 --> 00:01:43,825
12:00 and 1:00 a.m.
And both

00:01:43,825 --> 00:01:45,593
femoral arteries were severed.

00:01:45,593 --> 00:01:47,528
So he bled out.
What are those,

00:01:47,528 --> 00:01:49,864
bloody hoofprints?
Looks like it.

00:01:51,466 --> 00:01:53,468
So the reindeer

00:01:53,468 --> 00:01:55,636
sees Santa here die violently,

00:01:55,636 --> 00:01:57,872
breaks out of the pen,

00:01:57,872 --> 00:01:59,340
tracks through
the fresh blood.

00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,409
And I thought
Rudolph had it bad.

00:02:06,481 --> 00:02:08,983
There's blood
on the runner here.

00:02:08,983 --> 00:02:12,386
He was definitely run over
by the sleigh.

00:02:12,386 --> 00:02:14,789
Uh... Russell?

00:02:14,789 --> 00:02:17,291
I got a lot of
blood at his back.

00:02:18,493 --> 00:02:20,695
Could you help me
flip him?

00:02:23,531 --> 00:02:26,334
(Phillips grunts)

00:02:26,334 --> 00:02:27,435
(sighs heavily)

00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,239
Five sharp-force injuries.

00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:32,974
That's a lot of blood,
so he was still alive

00:02:32,974 --> 00:02:33,975
when he was stabbed.

00:02:35,476 --> 00:02:37,512
This is not an accident.
Grandma may have

00:02:37,512 --> 00:02:39,580
gotten run over
by a reindeer,

00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,716
but Santa got "sleighed."

SANDERS:
It's already 50 degrees,

00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,428
the sun's still rising.

00:03:27,428 --> 00:03:29,931
It's supposed to
get up to 70 today.

00:03:29,931 --> 00:03:32,533
Say good-bye to the snow.
SANDERS:
Our main priority

00:03:32,533 --> 00:03:35,603
is to record and preserve--
analyze everything

00:03:35,603 --> 00:03:36,971
when we get back to the lab.

00:03:36,971 --> 00:03:38,573
Are we good
for shoe impressions?

00:03:38,573 --> 00:03:39,974
Good?

00:03:39,974 --> 00:03:41,842
To collect them from the snow.

00:03:41,842 --> 00:03:43,744
I'm guessing
you didn't

00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,846
process many
cold scenes in L.A.

00:03:45,846 --> 00:03:48,282
(laughs) Try none.
All right, well,

00:03:48,282 --> 00:03:50,585
heat is usually the battle
here in Vegas,

00:03:50,585 --> 00:03:51,986
but today it's snow.

00:03:51,986 --> 00:03:53,888
Blood doesn't read
the same way,

00:03:53,888 --> 00:03:56,958
the drops blend in,
no spines, and prints

00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:58,826
don't lift easily.
Yeah, makes sense.

00:03:58,826 --> 00:04:00,728
So we are going to need

00:04:00,728 --> 00:04:03,731
liquid cold wax
to process any impressions,

00:04:03,731 --> 00:04:06,467
and dry ice, too.
All right.

00:04:06,467 --> 00:04:08,803
I'll call Hodges
and have him bring it on over.

00:04:13,307 --> 00:04:15,242
Right this way.

00:04:16,777 --> 00:04:19,013
Hi. I'm Ryan Bonham.
Sorry I kept you waiting.

00:04:19,013 --> 00:04:20,881
I had to check
on my son Blake.

00:04:20,881 --> 00:04:23,317
I, uh, just can't
believe all this.
No.

00:04:23,317 --> 00:04:25,386
It's a hell of a thing.
Sorry, I'm gonna

00:04:25,386 --> 00:04:27,488
have to ask you
a few questions here.

00:04:27,488 --> 00:04:30,858
How well did you know
the victim, Mr. Fante?

00:04:30,858 --> 00:04:32,860
I didn't know him that well--
I mean, he'd been

00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,996
with my company for
a few months.

00:04:34,996 --> 00:04:37,665
He was all psyched
to organize the Christmas party.

00:04:37,665 --> 00:04:40,301
Get along with
the other employees?
Oh, yeah.

00:04:40,301 --> 00:04:42,303
Brad worked miracles
with computers.

00:04:42,303 --> 00:04:43,504
Everyone loved him.

00:04:43,504 --> 00:04:45,606
He made a perfect Santa.

00:04:45,606 --> 00:04:48,476
Is there anything you
can tell me about last night?
Not really, no.

00:04:48,476 --> 00:04:50,611
I mean, you know, the
company had a great year,

00:04:50,611 --> 00:04:52,880
everybody was partying,
they were happy.

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,816
And then around 9:00, I went
upstairs to put Blake to bed.

00:04:55,816 --> 00:04:59,253
He's six now. Christmas is a
bit of a tough time for him.

00:04:59,253 --> 00:05:01,255
Mm.
For me, too.

00:05:01,255 --> 00:05:02,757
My, uh...

00:05:02,757 --> 00:05:04,759
my wife died...

00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:08,629
two years ago, Christmas Eve.

00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:09,797
Sorry to hear that.

00:05:09,797 --> 00:05:11,499
Yeah.

00:05:11,499 --> 00:05:13,334
Uh, anyway, like I said,
I stayed with him,

00:05:13,334 --> 00:05:15,469
I fell asleep,
the sirens woke me up,

00:05:15,469 --> 00:05:17,905
and I looked out my window...
you know, I thought I'd seen

00:05:17,905 --> 00:05:20,307
my share of Christmas tragedy
in my life, but...

00:05:21,642 --> 00:05:24,612
I guess not.

00:05:24,612 --> 00:05:28,282
You had a long night,
huh, Dash? Yeah.

00:05:28,282 --> 00:05:29,917
Bet you're hungry, huh?

00:05:29,917 --> 00:05:31,852
That's all right,
we're gonna get you some grub.

00:05:31,852 --> 00:05:34,321
Yeah, we'll get you
some food.
Mr. Walt?

00:05:35,356 --> 00:05:36,691
Yeah, that's me.

00:05:36,691 --> 00:05:39,360
Hey. I'm, uh,
CSI Sanders.

00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,929
I'm here to...
process your reindeer.

00:05:41,929 --> 00:05:45,533
Process? You don't
mean put him down?
No, I...

00:05:45,533 --> 00:05:48,936
just need to collect a sample
of blood from his fur.

00:05:48,936 --> 00:05:50,504
Why?
Well,

00:05:50,504 --> 00:05:52,339
he walked through
a crime scene,

00:05:52,339 --> 00:05:54,642
and the blood could
be from our victim

00:05:54,642 --> 00:05:56,811
or even from our killer.

00:05:56,811 --> 00:05:58,279
Okay.

00:06:00,948 --> 00:06:03,017
(grunting)

00:06:04,852 --> 00:06:06,554
It's okay, boy.

00:06:06,554 --> 00:06:08,522
It's just a little
cotton on a stick.

00:06:08,522 --> 00:06:10,357
Good.
Do you always leave

00:06:10,357 --> 00:06:12,259
your reindeer out at night?
Oh, yeah, yeah,

00:06:12,259 --> 00:06:14,395
they like it.
Yeah, what with the snow?

00:06:14,395 --> 00:06:15,863
Reminds them of Iceland.

00:06:15,863 --> 00:06:18,532
Only place in the world
you can find real reindeer.

00:06:18,532 --> 00:06:19,633
Yeah, they sleep

00:06:19,633 --> 00:06:21,769
by the glaciers.
Hey, you think

00:06:21,769 --> 00:06:24,505
Dasher saw who did it?
Um...

00:06:24,505 --> 00:06:26,841
it's...
certainly possible.

00:06:26,841 --> 00:06:28,709
You know, I saw
this thing on the news.

00:06:28,709 --> 00:06:30,611
They're giving MRIs
to dogs now.

00:06:30,611 --> 00:06:33,314
Their brains
are a lot like ours.

00:06:33,314 --> 00:06:34,648
Old Dasher here,

00:06:34,648 --> 00:06:36,383
he can't tell us what
he saw, but, you know,

00:06:36,383 --> 00:06:39,253
maybe someday we'll know
what he's thinking.

00:06:40,387 --> 00:06:41,889
All right, well, uh...

00:06:41,889 --> 00:06:44,892
I think I got what
I need. Thanks.

00:06:46,427 --> 00:06:48,395
Hey, Dash.

00:06:48,395 --> 00:06:50,664
Good boy. That was good.

00:06:50,664 --> 00:06:52,233
Yeah.

00:06:54,969 --> 00:06:56,837
You got something?

00:06:56,837 --> 00:06:58,739
HODGES:
Yeah, partial boot impression.

00:06:58,739 --> 00:07:00,708
I checked it against
Santa's--it's not his.

00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:02,343
Blood drop inside.

00:07:02,343 --> 00:07:04,011
Got blood drops
over here as well.

00:07:04,011 --> 00:07:07,515
Man, Greg was right.

00:07:07,515 --> 00:07:09,950
You can't tell
directionality.
But they are close

00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,519
to where the body was.

00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:13,721
Could be gravitational.
Suggests...

00:07:13,721 --> 00:07:15,756
this is the area
where it all happened.

00:07:15,756 --> 00:07:19,326
<i>Santa gets stabbed in the back,</i>

00:07:19,326 --> 00:07:21,762
<i>grabs at his wounds,</i>
<i>trying to stop the bleeding,</i>

00:07:21,762 --> 00:07:23,330
<i>but the blood is flowing.</i>

00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:25,900
<i>Bumps into the sled,</i>
<i>dislodges it.</i>

00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,002
<i>Sled slides downhill and...</i>

00:07:28,002 --> 00:07:30,337
And the elf kingdom weeps.

00:07:30,337 --> 00:07:32,807
Time for our
trusty ice wax.

00:07:34,341 --> 00:07:36,243
I had to use this
in the infamous

00:07:36,243 --> 00:07:37,678
Mount Charleston Chalet Murder.

00:07:37,678 --> 00:07:39,413
Death by ski pole.
Long story.

00:07:39,413 --> 00:07:41,615
So, how does it
work exactly?

00:07:41,615 --> 00:07:43,584
The wax preserves
the impression,

00:07:43,584 --> 00:07:46,387
<i>insulating the snow,</i>
<i>preventing any loss of detail</i>

00:07:46,387 --> 00:07:48,489
<i>caused by heat</i>
<i>from the exothermic reaction</i>

00:07:48,489 --> 00:07:50,424
of the casting material.

00:07:57,298 --> 00:07:58,632
And...

00:07:58,632 --> 00:08:01,235
voilà-- frosty cast.

00:08:01,235 --> 00:08:04,004
Nice. Um, what about
the blood drops?

00:08:05,306 --> 00:08:06,941
You can take them to go.

00:08:08,843 --> 00:08:10,611
All right.

00:08:10,611 --> 00:08:13,247
Why do you think Santa
was hanging out here

00:08:13,247 --> 00:08:15,382
all by his lonesome
after the party?

00:08:15,382 --> 00:08:17,418
He was probably recovering
from the forced levity

00:08:17,418 --> 00:08:19,253
of a hyper-commercialized
holiday

00:08:19,253 --> 00:08:21,488
that's lost
all sense of wonder.
Wow.

00:08:21,488 --> 00:08:24,358
Somebody got a lot of coal
in his stocking as a kid.
I wish.

00:08:24,358 --> 00:08:26,260
Instead of regaling me
with stories of Santa,

00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,928
my scientist father lectured me

00:08:27,928 --> 00:08:29,930
on the implausibility
of the whole thing.

00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:32,766
What, he didn't think
a fat man in a sleigh

00:08:32,766 --> 00:08:34,869
could make it around the world
in one night?

00:08:34,869 --> 00:08:37,504
He also had a problem
with the climate damage caused

00:08:37,504 --> 00:08:39,406

in the North Pole.

00:08:39,406 --> 00:08:43,544
God, I hope I don't have
you as my Secret Santa.
(chuckles)

00:08:43,544 --> 00:08:46,347
I can't believe we're actually
doing it again this year.

00:08:59,793 --> 00:09:01,729
Must be Bonham's kid.

00:09:01,729 --> 00:09:03,664
I wonder if he saw anything.

00:09:03,664 --> 00:09:05,666
BRODY: I don't think
anybody's talked to him yet.

00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:08,569
Maybe we should take
a shot at it.

00:09:08,569 --> 00:09:10,504

Yeah?
How's it going in here?

00:09:24,585 --> 00:09:26,720
Well, our friend
here, Mr. Fante,

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,890
is definitely on
someone's naughty list.

00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:31,425
Looks like
you got Secret Santa'd.

00:09:31,425 --> 00:09:32,693
You gonna open it?

00:09:32,693 --> 00:09:35,296
Why don't you do
the honors for me, Nick.

00:09:35,296 --> 00:09:36,497
All right.

more than a stab
in the back.

00:09:52,346 --> 00:09:54,615
He's got a cut on the cheek,
and bruising.

00:09:54,615 --> 00:09:56,350
Well, maybe
he was punched

00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:58,552
before he was knifed.

00:09:58,552 --> 00:10:00,487
Fiber in the wound.

00:10:00,487 --> 00:10:02,990

that almost looks synthetic.

00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,959
Killer could have
been wearing gloves.

00:10:08,462 --> 00:10:10,731
The stabbing was
particularly vicious.

00:10:10,731 --> 00:10:13,467
The killer twisted
the blade.

00:10:13,467 --> 00:10:16,337
Well, that's the personal touch
right there.

00:10:16,337 --> 00:10:17,571
Okay.

did you find any alcohol
in his stomach?

00:10:27,348 --> 00:10:28,949
Nope, just milk
and cookies.

00:10:28,949 --> 00:10:31,518
Mr. Claus was a teetotaler.

00:10:31,518 --> 00:10:33,754
Okay, there goes
the drunken-brawl theory.

00:10:33,754 --> 00:10:35,422
But one thing is for sure.

00:10:35,422 --> 00:10:40,294

Yeah. He fell asleep.

happened to see anything else?

00:11:27,908 --> 00:11:29,676
I saw a reindeer.

00:11:29,676 --> 00:11:31,478

pawing at the floor,

what you were experiencing

00:11:52,533 --> 00:11:55,936

00:11:55,936 --> 00:11:59,373
During REM sleep,
a pretty awesome

Now, this excess acetylcholine
is what makes you dream.

00:18:02,836 --> 00:18:05,505
bought me breakfast at R.J.'s.

00:18:05,505 --> 00:18:07,574
Fante was alive when we left.

00:18:09,576 --> 00:18:11,545
So I go the security cam
footage back from R.J.'s diner.

00:18:11,545 --> 00:18:15,348
It confirms Rachel Walker
and Fred Larkin's story.

00:18:15,348 --> 00:18:18,685
Doc said T.O.D.
on Brad Fante

00:18:18,685 --> 00:18:21,922
was between midnight
and 1:00 a.m.

00:18:21,922 --> 00:18:23,723
So, they definitely
have alibis,

00:18:23,723 --> 00:18:25,392
according to
the time stamp.

00:18:25,392 --> 00:18:26,993
So, where does
that leave us?

00:18:26,993 --> 00:18:29,529
With no suspect
and a lot of work to do.

00:18:29,529 --> 00:18:32,966
Yeah. New bracelet?

00:18:32,966 --> 00:18:34,601
That is very observant of you.

00:18:34,601 --> 00:18:37,537
Well, it's why they
pay me the big bucks.

00:18:37,537 --> 00:18:39,339
Come on. You're dying
for me to say,

00:18:39,339 --> 00:18:40,807
"Thank you.
That was so generous."

00:18:40,807 --> 00:18:43,009
I don't know
what you're talking about.

00:18:43,009 --> 00:18:44,711
Yes, you do.

00:18:44,711 --> 00:18:45,946
No, I don't.

00:18:45,946 --> 00:18:48,281
Okay, well,
I'm your Secret Santa.

00:18:48,281 --> 00:18:50,417
And I was planning

00:18:50,417 --> 00:18:52,452
on matching your generosity
with something

00:18:52,452 --> 00:18:54,387
that I think you would
really like.

00:18:54,387 --> 00:18:55,655
Well, I hate
to break your heart,

00:18:55,655 --> 00:18:56,623
but I'm not your Secret Santa.

00:18:56,623 --> 00:18:57,958
Really?

00:18:57,958 --> 00:18:59,359
Really.

00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:01,361
Well, that's unfortunate.

00:19:01,361 --> 00:19:04,264
Very unfortunate for you.

00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,902
Ah. I hate Christmas.

00:19:08,902 --> 00:19:12,772
Hey. Finn said you
found some mystery tissue

00:19:12,772 --> 00:19:15,675
in one of the snow samples
I took from the scene.

00:19:15,675 --> 00:19:17,377
Not a mystery anymore.

00:19:17,377 --> 00:19:18,612
Is it from our victim?

00:19:18,612 --> 00:19:20,580
No. In fact,
it's not even human.

00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,883
Sarda Chiliensis Lineolata.

00:19:22,883 --> 00:19:24,251
Otherwise known as

00:19:24,251 --> 00:19:26,386
Pacific Bonito.
Bonito?

00:19:26,386 --> 00:19:27,921
Well, they use it in sushi.

00:19:27,921 --> 00:19:29,723
Did they serve that
at the party?

00:19:29,723 --> 00:19:32,792
Well, if so, it's not the only
thing that they were serving.

00:19:32,792 --> 00:19:34,661
I ran tox on the fish guts.

00:19:34,661 --> 00:19:36,363
Found traces of cocaine.

00:19:36,363 --> 00:19:38,932
We know Brad Fante organized
the office party.

00:19:38,932 --> 00:19:41,535
He went off-script
hiring Miss Reindeer.

00:19:41,535 --> 00:19:44,237
Who knows what else
he had planned for the night.

00:19:44,237 --> 00:19:47,674
We know he ordered bonito
with a side of coke.

00:19:47,674 --> 00:19:49,943
We know that he tried
to stiff the stripper,

00:19:49,943 --> 00:19:51,945
in more ways than one.

00:19:51,945 --> 00:19:54,514
Well, if he was cheap
with the stripper,

00:19:54,514 --> 00:19:56,816
maybe he stiffed
his dealer, too.

00:19:56,816 --> 00:19:59,653
Then got stiffed.

00:19:59,653 --> 00:20:03,323
STOKES: This is Brad Fante's
little helper, Fred Larkin.

00:20:03,323 --> 00:20:04,858
Not only did he
film the stripper

00:20:04,858 --> 00:20:06,793
doing her reindeer
dance, he also

00:20:06,793 --> 00:20:08,261
taped most of the party.

00:20:08,261 --> 00:20:09,930
So, I've been going
through it, hoping

00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:12,399
I'd see the killer getting into
some kind of beef with Santa.

00:20:12,399 --> 00:20:13,633
What did you find?

00:20:13,633 --> 00:20:15,835
Oh, typical
Christmas party stuff.

00:20:15,835 --> 00:20:20,307
A quiet guy singing,
unlikely couple hooking up,

00:20:20,307 --> 00:20:22,409
office joker crying
in his beer.

00:20:22,409 --> 00:20:23,944
Anything unexpected?

00:20:23,944 --> 00:20:27,447
Yeah. I found two Santas.

00:20:27,447 --> 00:20:29,449
Take a look at this.

00:20:29,449 --> 00:20:30,984
Here's the first thing
I noticed.

00:20:30,984 --> 00:20:34,321
Santa pounding a glass of wine.

00:20:34,321 --> 00:20:36,289
It's a party. So what?

00:20:36,289 --> 00:20:38,625
Well, according to the doc,
he didn't drink alcohol.

00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:40,827
Stomach contents were
just milk and cookies.

00:20:40,827 --> 00:20:42,629
So, take a look at this.

00:20:43,697 --> 00:20:44,965
This is 20 minutes later.

00:20:44,965 --> 00:20:47,367
There's our wine-drinking Santa,

00:20:47,367 --> 00:20:49,302
and it looks like
he gets a phone call.

00:20:49,302 --> 00:20:51,338
Now, it must have been pretty
important, because I think

00:20:51,338 --> 00:20:53,273
that's when he
ditched the party

00:20:53,273 --> 00:20:55,675
and lent his suit
to Brad Fante,

00:20:55,675 --> 00:20:58,678
who, as we know, had his own
plans for what to do with that.

00:20:58,678 --> 00:21:01,014
And how do we know
it's the same suit?
Look right here.

00:21:02,315 --> 00:21:03,617
The sleeve.

00:21:03,617 --> 00:21:05,018
See the stain?

00:21:05,018 --> 00:21:07,320
45 minutes later.

00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:10,457
Same suit, different watches,
different beverages...

00:21:11,992 --> 00:21:13,526
...different Santas.
Well, it's easy for us

00:21:13,526 --> 00:21:15,729
to tell them apart,
because we have this

00:21:15,729 --> 00:21:18,498
video, we have forensics, but...

00:21:18,498 --> 00:21:20,000
what if the killer couldn't?

00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,868
Well, we've run out of suspects

00:21:21,868 --> 00:21:23,436
with motives to kill the guy.

00:21:23,436 --> 00:21:26,473
Maybe Brad Fante
was not the target.

00:21:26,473 --> 00:21:28,475
No. No, the target...

00:21:28,475 --> 00:21:31,411
was this other Santa.

00:21:32,746 --> 00:21:35,382
So, who is he?

00:21:39,552 --> 00:21:41,721
At Winter Wonderland, we'll
create a winter wonderland

00:21:41,721 --> 00:21:43,623
you'll never forget.

00:21:43,623 --> 00:21:47,227
We're your first and last stop
for all your holiday needs.

00:21:47,227 --> 00:21:50,630
Hey! We'll even supply you
with real snow,

00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:53,767
a live reindeer
and all the trimmings.

00:21:53,767 --> 00:21:57,771
Including old St. Nick,
himself--ho, ho, ho!

00:21:57,771 --> 00:22:00,306
So, come on down
to Winter Wonderland.

00:22:00,306 --> 00:22:02,676
And tell 'em Jayson sent you.

00:22:02,676 --> 00:22:03,877
So, our reindeer wrangler

00:22:03,877 --> 00:22:07,013
neglected to tell us
that "Santa" was

00:22:07,013 --> 00:22:08,815
part of the Winter
Wonderland package.

00:22:08,815 --> 00:22:10,250
According to Greg,

00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,786
he passed himself off
as just an employee.

00:22:12,786 --> 00:22:14,654
Looks like he owns the company.
That still doesn't tell us

00:22:14,654 --> 00:22:17,223
why someone tried
to kill him, though.

00:22:17,223 --> 00:22:18,491
I might be able
to help with that.

00:22:18,491 --> 00:22:19,926
What do you got?
Well, you know

00:22:19,926 --> 00:22:22,529
the cocaine-laced bonito
we found in the snow

00:22:22,529 --> 00:22:24,464
at Ryan Bonham's yard?

00:22:24,464 --> 00:22:25,932
Well, it turns out that

00:22:25,932 --> 00:22:27,734
bonito wasn't
served at the party.

00:22:27,734 --> 00:22:29,235
So how'd it
get there?

00:22:29,235 --> 00:22:31,337
It was already in the ice.

00:22:32,272 --> 00:22:33,473
How does that work?

00:22:33,473 --> 00:22:34,908
Well, I ran the
truck manifest.

00:22:34,908 --> 00:22:36,810
When it's not working
holiday parties,

00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:40,346
it makes a lot of trips
from Mexico to Vegas,

00:22:40,346 --> 00:22:42,782
transporting
Pacific Bonito--

00:22:42,782 --> 00:22:43,917
on ice.

00:22:43,917 --> 00:22:45,852
<i>Bonito stuffed with cocaine.</i>

00:22:48,488 --> 00:22:51,591
<i>Which is how remnants</i>
<i>of bonito and coke</i>

00:22:51,591 --> 00:22:53,259
<i>got mixed in with ice.</i>

00:22:53,259 --> 00:22:57,263
<i>The same ice used</i>
<i>to make the snow.</i>

00:22:57,263 --> 00:22:59,466
Jayson Walt thought
he was providing

00:22:59,466 --> 00:23:00,934
a little snow for Christmas.

00:23:00,934 --> 00:23:02,635
What he
didn't realize

00:23:02,635 --> 00:23:05,905
is that he was adding
a little powder to the powder.

00:23:05,905 --> 00:23:08,274
Well, that gives us motive
for someone to try to kill him.

00:23:08,274 --> 00:23:10,410
Guy's a major
drug runner.

00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:11,911
Could've been working
with cartels in Mexico.

00:23:11,911 --> 00:23:13,913
That's one Bad Santa.

00:23:13,913 --> 00:23:15,682
That's one <i>dead</i> Santa,

00:23:15,682 --> 00:23:18,384
if we don't bring him in
before the killer finds him.

00:23:23,022 --> 00:23:24,457
Thanks for coming in, Mr. Walt.

00:23:24,457 --> 00:23:26,693
I know it's a busy time
of year for you.

00:23:26,693 --> 00:23:28,762
LVPD interested
in a White Christmas party?

00:23:28,762 --> 00:23:29,929
No.

00:23:29,929 --> 00:23:31,564
I'm interested in a dead Santa

00:23:31,564 --> 00:23:33,566
that was found
in Ryan Bonham's lawn.

00:23:33,566 --> 00:23:36,736
Now, up to 9:33, you
were the guy in the
red suit playing Santa.

00:23:36,736 --> 00:23:37,837
You didn't tell us that.

00:23:37,837 --> 00:23:40,306
Nobody asked.
Look, pal,

00:23:40,306 --> 00:23:42,575
whoever killed the guy
in the suit was after you.

00:23:42,575 --> 00:23:45,478
No way. Why would
anyone want to kill me?

00:23:45,478 --> 00:23:46,813
I don't know, maybe
'cause you're running drugs

00:23:46,813 --> 00:23:48,448
from Mexico in your ice truck.

00:23:48,448 --> 00:23:50,984
Yeah, we found
fish guts laced
with cocaine

00:23:50,984 --> 00:23:53,620
on Ryan Bonham's lawn.

00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,555
Okay, look.

00:23:55,555 --> 00:23:57,791
This is the part
of the interview where
you help us help you.

00:23:57,791 --> 00:23:58,992
Oh, yeah. How's that?

00:23:58,992 --> 00:24:00,760
Well, in your
line of business--

00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,695
and I'm not talking about
spreading holiday cheer

00:24:02,695 --> 00:24:05,331
by putting fake snow on
lawns--I'm talking about

00:24:05,331 --> 00:24:08,434
the other kind of cheer
with the other kind of snow.

00:24:08,434 --> 00:24:10,937
Now, obviously,
you've made enemies.

00:24:10,937 --> 00:24:12,772
You tell us who they
are, we'll help you

00:24:12,772 --> 00:24:14,340
broker a deal with the DEA.

00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:17,277
And what if I don't
want to you help me?

00:24:17,277 --> 00:24:19,345
Well, then it's a
quick trip upstate.

00:24:19,345 --> 00:24:20,713
And the inmates
up there have

00:24:20,713 --> 00:24:22,715
absolutely no
goodwill toward men.

00:24:22,715 --> 00:24:24,350
Yeah, I think
I'll take my chances.

00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:26,452
I'm trying to
save your life.

00:24:26,452 --> 00:24:28,288
Yeah, or maybe you're
trying to work an angle.

00:24:28,288 --> 00:24:29,489
Wouldn't be
the first party

00:24:29,489 --> 00:24:31,291
to have sushi
and coke delivered.

00:24:31,291 --> 00:24:32,759
Plus, I don't buy
that you got evidence

00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:33,993
that I'm the delivery boy.

00:24:33,993 --> 00:24:35,895
So, if we're
through here,

00:24:35,895 --> 00:24:38,631
I'm late for my next Santa gig.

00:24:38,631 --> 00:24:40,333
Sit down,
Kringle.

00:24:40,333 --> 00:24:42,669
Sit back down!

00:24:42,669 --> 00:24:44,003
We have evidence.

00:24:44,003 --> 00:24:45,872
We have your snow.
We have your product.

00:24:45,872 --> 00:24:48,441
Someone's gonna
read you your rights.

00:24:48,441 --> 00:24:50,376
You're under arrest.

00:24:50,376 --> 00:24:51,444
Process him.

00:25:01,688 --> 00:25:02,655
Nail polish?

00:25:02,655 --> 00:25:04,557
"For your mistletoes."

00:25:04,557 --> 00:25:06,226
It's cute.

00:25:06,226 --> 00:25:07,327
I like.

00:25:07,327 --> 00:25:08,595
Total chick gift.

00:25:08,595 --> 00:25:10,330
I bet Finn's your Secret Santa.

00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:11,831
Maybe.

00:25:11,831 --> 00:25:13,867
Or maybe it's you,
trying to cleverly trick me.

00:25:13,867 --> 00:25:16,703
Well, I guess we'll just have
to wait for the office party,

00:25:16,703 --> 00:25:17,871
and all will be revealed.

00:25:17,871 --> 00:25:19,405
In the meantime...

00:25:19,405 --> 00:25:20,840
Check this out, I just got

00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,776
Jayson Walt's phone records.
For the last week,

00:25:23,776 --> 00:25:27,280
he has been in touch with
someone at Ely prison.

00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,249
What, making reservations?
No.

00:25:29,249 --> 00:25:30,650
Texting and talking

00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:33,286
with his convict
older brother, Gary Lee Walt.

00:25:33,286 --> 00:25:34,287
What's Gary in for?

00:25:34,287 --> 00:25:35,788
Drug trafficking.

00:25:35,788 --> 00:25:39,259
So maybe the little brother
is holding the family business

00:25:39,259 --> 00:25:40,927
together while
big brother's inside.

00:25:40,927 --> 00:25:42,662
That's what I thought,

00:25:42,662 --> 00:25:46,232
until I looked at Gary
Lee's trial transcript.

00:25:46,232 --> 00:25:49,235
Last year, Jayson Walt
turned state's evidence

00:25:49,235 --> 00:25:50,703
and testified against
his own brother.

00:25:50,703 --> 00:25:52,839
Well, he was probably just
trying to save his own ass.

00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:56,509
And his own piece
of the drug trafficking pie.

00:25:56,509 --> 00:25:58,845
So, why do you think
they're talking now?

00:25:58,845 --> 00:26:00,713
Gary Lee just
won an appeal.

00:26:00,713 --> 00:26:02,649
He has a hearing
scheduled.

00:26:02,649 --> 00:26:05,718
How much you want to bet older
brother's gonna try and convince

00:26:05,718 --> 00:26:06,953
younger brother
to change his story?

00:26:06,953 --> 00:26:08,321
Yeah.

00:26:08,321 --> 00:26:09,956
With a little
cash incentive.

00:26:09,956 --> 00:26:11,557
Take a look at this
last communication.

00:26:11,557 --> 00:26:14,394
"Jayson: Make it 200."

00:26:14,394 --> 00:26:15,929
"Gary Lee: Can't."

00:26:15,929 --> 00:26:17,797
"Jayson: No deal, bro."

00:26:17,797 --> 00:26:21,267
Brotherly love.
Two days after this exchange,

00:26:21,267 --> 00:26:23,303
Brad Fante was
knifed in the back,

00:26:23,303 --> 00:26:26,239
just after Jayson loaned
him his Santa suit.

00:26:26,239 --> 00:26:29,542
So, big brother
tries to cut a Kringle...

00:26:29,542 --> 00:26:30,977
and misses.

00:26:30,977 --> 00:26:33,479
I think it's time
for us to make a trip to Ely.

00:26:33,479 --> 00:26:35,448
Well, we don't even
have to go that far.

00:26:35,448 --> 00:26:38,318
Gary Lee was just admitted
to Desert Palm Hospital.

00:26:38,318 --> 00:26:40,019
Kidney failure.

00:26:42,522 --> 00:26:44,357
NICK:
Mr. Walt.

00:26:44,357 --> 00:26:46,960
I'm CSI Stokes.

00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,330
With the LVPD.
I'm here to ask
you a few questions

00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:51,731
about your brother, Jayson.

00:26:51,731 --> 00:26:53,833
What about him?

00:26:53,833 --> 00:26:55,868
Well, it seems
like somebody's
trying to kill him.

00:26:55,868 --> 00:26:57,437
It's not surprising.

00:26:57,437 --> 00:26:59,939
My little brother has
a way of pissing people off.

00:26:59,939 --> 00:27:02,275
Like you.
Seems like you'd get

00:27:02,275 --> 00:27:04,410
pissed off
pretty easily.

00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:06,946
Course, I wouldn't
blame you, after what
he did to you last year--

00:27:06,946 --> 00:27:09,349
turning his back
on you like that.

00:27:09,349 --> 00:27:11,484
Jayson was just
a scared little kid.

00:27:11,484 --> 00:27:13,353
Lied.

00:27:13,353 --> 00:27:14,921
He's gonna come clean now.

00:27:14,921 --> 00:27:17,557
Really? I don't know, it
doesn't seem like you two

00:27:17,557 --> 00:27:19,926
kiss and make
up that easy.

00:27:19,926 --> 00:27:20,960
What tells you that?

00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,362
Pictures.

00:27:22,362 --> 00:27:24,731
I think your hit man
made a mistake.

00:27:24,731 --> 00:27:27,400
That's supposed to be
your brother, isn't it?

00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,702
I think you're the one
who's making the mistake.

00:27:29,702 --> 00:27:32,238
'Cause Jayson is
the last person in the world

00:27:32,238 --> 00:27:33,506
I would want to kill.

00:27:33,506 --> 00:27:35,775
Because he's gonna deliver

00:27:35,775 --> 00:27:38,711
the greatest
Christmas present ever.

00:27:38,711 --> 00:27:40,513
He's gonna give me
my life back.

00:27:40,513 --> 00:27:43,783
In court and right here,
in the hospital.

00:27:43,783 --> 00:27:46,753
'Cause, you see, we've got

00:27:46,753 --> 00:27:51,457
perfect matching
leukocyte antigens.

00:27:51,457 --> 00:27:53,659
Jayson's gonna be
your kidney donor.

00:27:53,659 --> 00:27:55,628
Real proud of my little bro.

00:27:55,628 --> 00:27:57,897
He's stepping up. Family.

00:27:57,897 --> 00:28:00,433
Yeah, family.
You know, I've read your texts.

00:28:00,433 --> 00:28:02,969
I know you two were
haggling over money, and I
know you were paying him.

00:28:02,969 --> 00:28:06,539
Well...we all need
a little incentive.

00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:09,742
Yeah, but he wasn't happy with
what you were offering.

00:28:09,742 --> 00:28:13,012
And now,
unfortunately for you,

00:28:13,012 --> 00:28:14,647
I don't think he's
gonna be available.

00:28:15,882 --> 00:28:18,518
Sorry.

00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,388
News flash.

00:28:24,524 --> 00:28:26,859
Jayson and I
arrived at a number.

00:28:26,859 --> 00:28:29,529
And we came
to an understanding.

00:28:29,529 --> 00:28:31,964
Including a little advance.

00:28:31,964 --> 00:28:33,399
For his bail.

00:28:33,399 --> 00:28:34,400
His bail.

00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,535
That's right.

00:28:35,535 --> 00:28:37,437
He's getting out just about now.

00:28:37,437 --> 00:28:40,840
Tomorrow he'll be in here
saving my sorry ass.

00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:43,709
Week after that,
he'll be recanting.

00:28:43,709 --> 00:28:45,478
Then I'm going to have

00:28:45,478 --> 00:28:48,347
the merriest Christmas
Vegas has ever seen.

00:28:51,384 --> 00:28:52,852
Ho, ho, ho.

00:28:52,852 --> 00:28:54,387
RUSSELL:
<i>So the guy we thought</i>

00:28:54,387 --> 00:28:56,756
had the best motive
for killing Jayson Walt

00:28:56,756 --> 00:28:58,391
is actually the guy

00:28:58,391 --> 00:29:00,827
who has the least desire
to see any harm come to him.

00:29:00,827 --> 00:29:01,961
Yeah, without
his brother's kidney,

00:29:01,961 --> 00:29:03,496
Gary Lee's a dead man.

00:29:07,433 --> 00:29:08,568
What are you thinking?

00:29:08,568 --> 00:29:10,002
You got anything?

00:29:10,002 --> 00:29:11,504
The autopsy.

00:29:11,504 --> 00:29:12,905
<i>It shows us that the killer</i>

00:29:12,905 --> 00:29:15,708
<i>stabbed the victim</i>
<i>and then twisted that knife.</i>

00:29:15,708 --> 00:29:17,710
Right. We thought
it was personal.
Okay,

00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:19,445
what if it was
more than just personal?

00:29:19,445 --> 00:29:21,013
I mean, given
the fact that

00:29:21,013 --> 00:29:23,316
Gary Lee needs a
kidney so desperately,

00:29:23,316 --> 00:29:26,285
what if their total destruction
was the killer's intent?

00:29:26,285 --> 00:29:27,453
You know
what I mean?

00:29:27,453 --> 00:29:29,355
You destroy
Jayson Walt's kidneys,

00:29:29,355 --> 00:29:31,457
you're in effect
killing Gary Lee Walt.

00:29:31,457 --> 00:29:33,259
Murder by proxy.

00:29:33,259 --> 00:29:36,429
So our question is
who wants Gary Lee Walt dead?

00:29:36,429 --> 00:29:40,600
I give you Gary Lee Walt's
greatest hits.

00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,734
Allegedly.

00:29:41,734 --> 00:29:43,469
These are all
drug related kills

00:29:43,469 --> 00:29:45,271
that he is suspected
of ordering.

00:29:45,271 --> 00:29:49,308
SANDERS:
Mala Noche's...
Mad-10's... Aquila Cartel.

00:29:49,308 --> 00:29:50,510
Anyone of
them could've
ordered the hit.

00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:51,744
Yeah, that's what I thought.

00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:54,747
Until I came to
this crime scene.

00:29:54,747 --> 00:29:58,017
Ryan Bonham's wife, Eva.

00:29:58,017 --> 00:30:01,888
He told us that she died two
years ago on Christmas Eve.

00:30:01,888 --> 00:30:03,623
This is how.

00:30:03,623 --> 00:30:06,759
Eva Bonham worked
at a Savings &amp; Loan.

00:30:06,759 --> 00:30:08,327
FINLAY:
Yes. Gary Lee Walt

00:30:08,327 --> 00:30:10,997
was laundering
his drug money at that bank.

00:30:10,997 --> 00:30:14,367
An executive found out,
was about to go to the police.

00:30:14,367 --> 00:30:16,235
But Gary Lee Walt
got to him first.

00:30:16,235 --> 00:30:18,838
Eva Bonham was
working late that night

00:30:18,838 --> 00:30:20,640
and became collateral damage.

00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,375
SANDERS:
Leaving behind a husband

00:30:22,375 --> 00:30:24,477
to care for their
little boy alone.

00:30:24,477 --> 00:30:27,513
So Ryan Bonham has been
in touch with the DA all along.

00:30:27,513 --> 00:30:28,915
He knew about the appeal.

00:30:28,915 --> 00:30:31,617
He also knew that
it had to be rescheduled

00:30:31,617 --> 00:30:33,486
because of Gary Lee Walt's
surgery.

00:30:33,486 --> 00:30:34,921
And he must have
known that Jayson Walt

00:30:34,921 --> 00:30:36,622
was going to give his
brother his kidney.

00:30:36,622 --> 00:30:39,892
And he couldn't stand to
see Gary Lee Walt saved.

00:30:39,892 --> 00:30:41,394
Can't say I blame him.

00:30:41,394 --> 00:30:44,997
So Ryan hires Jayson Walt
to work his party.

00:30:44,997 --> 00:30:49,268
<i>He wants to get him alone,</i>
<i>on his turf...</i>

00:30:49,268 --> 00:30:50,736
(grunting)

00:30:53,606 --> 00:30:54,907
<i>...except it's the wrong Santa.</i>

00:30:54,907 --> 00:30:55,942
Brad.

00:30:55,942 --> 00:30:56,709
Ryan....?!

00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,648
(screaming)

00:31:02,648 --> 00:31:04,283
FINLAY:
<i>Ryan panics.</i>

00:31:04,283 --> 00:31:05,952
<i>Can't believe</i>
<i>what he's done.</i>

00:31:05,952 --> 00:31:08,020
<i>Goes inside and gets</i>
<i>rid of the evidence.</i>

00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:10,656
He runs back upstairs
to be with his kid,

00:31:10,656 --> 00:31:12,825
wishing he could
will it all away.

00:31:12,825 --> 00:31:13,893
Me too.

00:31:13,893 --> 00:31:15,394
'Cause now that kid's

00:31:15,394 --> 00:31:17,530
going to lose
both his parents.

00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:20,366
(sirens wailing)

00:31:20,366 --> 00:31:22,602
(tires screech, sirens stop)

00:31:29,742 --> 00:31:30,910
Las Vegas Police!

00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:32,845
Ryan Bonham!

00:31:32,845 --> 00:31:34,680
Go, go, go.

00:31:38,918 --> 00:31:41,354
(distant thumping)

00:31:56,836 --> 00:31:58,838
Whew...

00:31:58,838 --> 00:31:59,972
Blake.

00:31:59,972 --> 00:32:02,441
It's okay.

00:32:02,441 --> 00:32:04,610
You're safe, son.
I'm a policeman.

00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:06,245
Some men came.

00:32:06,245 --> 00:32:07,480
They took my daddy.

00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,889
STOKES:
<i>I heard Ryan Bonham's missing.</i>
<i>What the hell happened to him?</i>

00:32:16,889 --> 00:32:18,457
Yeah, some guys broke in.
They trashed the place.

00:32:18,457 --> 00:32:20,259
I had a bad feeling.

00:32:20,259 --> 00:32:21,927
When the fake Santa, Jayson
Walt, made bail, he disappeared.

00:32:21,927 --> 00:32:23,663
Bet he figured out
Ryan tried to kill him?

00:32:23,663 --> 00:32:25,331
That's a safe bet.
And what
about the kid,

00:32:25,331 --> 00:32:26,899
Blake?

00:32:26,899 --> 00:32:29,335
Well, you know, he's okay.
He's a little shaken up.

00:32:29,335 --> 00:32:30,936
Yeah? Did he see anything?
I don't know.

00:32:30,936 --> 00:32:32,872
He'll only talk to one person.

00:32:32,872 --> 00:32:34,740
Who?

00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:35,841
Me?!

00:32:35,841 --> 00:32:37,276
(scoffs)

00:32:37,276 --> 00:32:38,778
Last time I saw him,
I scared him.

00:32:38,778 --> 00:32:40,346
He said he wanted
to talk to--

00:32:40,346 --> 00:32:43,349
and I quote--
"the funny science man."

00:32:43,349 --> 00:32:45,618
A compliment, I suppose, but...

00:32:45,618 --> 00:32:47,620
you got to help me out here.

00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:49,789
Just relax. Engage him. Here.

00:32:49,789 --> 00:32:51,757
Give him this.
Chocolate.

00:32:51,757 --> 00:32:52,892
Get him talking.

00:32:52,892 --> 00:32:54,493
I'm sure he saw something.

00:32:54,493 --> 00:32:56,629
This is a bad idea.
I'm gonna screw this up.

00:32:56,629 --> 00:32:59,332
Just, you know,
give it your best shot.

00:32:59,332 --> 00:33:01,534
(sighs)

00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:21,687
(sighs)

00:33:23,422 --> 00:33:25,358
Hey... little man.

00:33:25,358 --> 00:33:26,492
Hi.

00:33:31,897 --> 00:33:33,799
Sorry. I'm allergic.

00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:36,235
Yeah. Me, too.

00:33:39,672 --> 00:33:41,674
I like your watch.

00:33:41,674 --> 00:33:43,542
I used to have one
just like it.

00:33:43,542 --> 00:33:45,611
It's purple.
Good color.

00:33:45,611 --> 00:33:47,480
And the diode display.

00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,814
Groundbreaking technology

00:33:48,814 --> 00:33:50,683
for its day.

00:33:50,683 --> 00:33:53,352
Not that you...

00:33:53,352 --> 00:33:54,553
You're a science man,

00:33:54,553 --> 00:33:55,821
right?

00:33:55,821 --> 00:33:57,223
You know big words.

00:33:57,223 --> 00:34:00,793
Sure. I-I know
some big words.

00:34:00,793 --> 00:34:04,263
Did the people with your daddy
use big words?

00:34:04,263 --> 00:34:06,866
Uh-huh. "Condestorb."

00:34:06,866 --> 00:34:09,935
"Condestorb"?
When they were going,

00:34:09,935 --> 00:34:11,704
one man yelled
at the other man.

00:34:11,704 --> 00:34:15,574
He was mad because he hadn't
gotten his condestorb fixed.

00:34:15,574 --> 00:34:17,943
Do you mean "condenser"?

00:34:17,943 --> 00:34:19,979
Yeah! What is that?

00:34:19,979 --> 00:34:22,481
It's a machine
that helps freeze things.

00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:26,819
Did you see the truck
the men came in, Blake?

00:34:26,819 --> 00:34:28,421
Yeah, when they drove up.

00:34:28,421 --> 00:34:30,222
When my dad told me to hide.

00:34:30,222 --> 00:34:32,825
And was it the same truck that
was at the party at your house?

00:34:32,825 --> 00:34:34,627
Uh-huh.

00:34:34,627 --> 00:34:37,229
Will my daddy be okay?

00:34:39,698 --> 00:34:41,834
As long as he knows
what a great,

00:34:41,834 --> 00:34:43,836
smart son he has,

00:34:43,836 --> 00:34:45,538
he's gonna be just fine.

00:34:45,538 --> 00:34:47,673
He's a very lucky daddy.

00:34:47,673 --> 00:34:49,875
Thanks.

00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:52,578
Traffic cam

00:34:52,578 --> 00:34:54,580
caught Jayson Walt's
ice truck turning off

00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:56,949
I-15 onto 215 East

00:34:56,949 --> 00:34:59,885
one hour ago.
I'm guessing
that Ryan Bonham is

00:34:59,885 --> 00:35:02,555
in the back, on ice, and
they're taking him out of town.

00:35:02,555 --> 00:35:04,790
Yeah, but I don't get it.
Why didn't they just
kill him at the house?

00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:06,826
Maybe Ryan has something
they want.

00:35:06,826 --> 00:35:09,728
So, where do you think
they're going?

00:35:09,728 --> 00:35:11,864
My guess is someplace isolated,

00:35:11,864 --> 00:35:15,434
where they feel safe...
so they can rough him up.

00:35:15,434 --> 00:35:17,536
Maybe...

00:35:17,536 --> 00:35:19,605
where they make
their ice.

00:35:19,605 --> 00:35:21,440
Why do you say that?

00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,443
Because when I analyzed
the melted snow,

00:35:24,443 --> 00:35:26,479
there was no chlorine
in the water.

00:35:26,479 --> 00:35:29,982
And all of Las Vegas'
tap water adds chlorine.

00:35:29,982 --> 00:35:32,518
If I test the diatoms
in the melted snow,

00:35:32,518 --> 00:35:35,788
I might be able to...
pinpoint the water source.

00:35:35,788 --> 00:35:37,990
Give us a location.

00:36:09,855 --> 00:36:11,423
Hey.

00:36:11,423 --> 00:36:14,460
So, that party snow came
from a small lake

00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,794
near Henderson.
So that's
where the truck's going.

00:36:15,794 --> 00:36:17,930
Yeah, I ran property records
in Henderson.

00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:19,632
Turns out the Walt brothers

00:36:19,632 --> 00:36:21,901
have had a warehouse there
since the early '90s.

00:36:21,901 --> 00:36:24,603
Good work, Greg.
Well, I hope
it's not too late.

Stop it.
Please stop! Stop.

00:36:39,818 --> 00:36:41,487
I'll show you where it is.

00:36:41,487 --> 00:36:42,821
No, you're gonna tell me
where to find it!

00:36:42,821 --> 00:36:44,323
I can't tell you
where to find it!

00:36:44,323 --> 00:36:45,724
Hold it, hold it, hold it.
Hey, hey!

No. Wait.
Aw, it doesn't
matter anyway. Go on.

00:36:50,863 --> 00:36:53,232
Power it up!

00:36:53,232 --> 00:36:55,267
You know,
cops said someone

00:36:55,267 --> 00:36:58,370
was trying to kill me--
Santa stabbed in the back

00:36:58,370 --> 00:36:59,638
at your house.

00:36:59,638 --> 00:37:01,307

Hey! You listening
to me? Huh?

00:37:11,984 --> 00:37:13,686
Last chance, Ryan!

00:37:13,686 --> 00:37:15,588

I'll bust a cap
right in your kidneys.

00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:40,846
I'll kill you

00:37:40,846 --> 00:37:42,548
and your brother.

00:37:42,548 --> 00:37:43,616

00:37:49,021 --> 00:37:50,222
They killed my wife!

00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:51,991
Do it!

00:37:51,991 --> 00:37:53,759

00:38:15,014 --> 00:38:17,616
You should've killed him.

00:38:17,616 --> 00:38:19,985
Ryan Bonham,
you're under arrest.

00:38:19,985 --> 00:38:21,320
Get him out of here.

00:38:39,705 --> 00:38:42,374
He made a full confession.

00:38:42,374 --> 00:38:45,244
He admitted to killing
Brad Fante by mistake.

00:38:45,244 --> 00:38:47,379
He's lucky Jayson Walt
didn't kill him.

00:38:47,379 --> 00:38:49,248
He saw them coming.
He told his kid to hide.

00:38:49,248 --> 00:38:52,017
Then when they busted in, he
somehow convinced Jayson Walt

00:38:52,017 --> 00:38:53,585
that his wife had bank records

00:38:53,585 --> 00:38:55,854
that would incriminate both him
and his brother.

00:38:55,854 --> 00:38:57,456
There were no records.

00:38:57,456 --> 00:38:59,391
Buying time.

00:38:59,391 --> 00:39:01,860
Till we could find his kid.
Well...

00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:04,830
losing your wife like that...

00:39:06,832 --> 00:39:08,734
Anyway...

00:39:08,734 --> 00:39:11,770
Oh, there's been a little mix-up
in Jayson Walt's custody.

00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:14,406
A Henderson, Nevada,
sheriff showed up--

00:39:14,406 --> 00:39:15,607
he's a friend--

00:39:15,607 --> 00:39:18,277
and I handed Jayson Walt
over to him.

00:39:18,277 --> 00:39:21,413
The weird thing is that his
wristband number got transposed.

00:39:21,413 --> 00:39:22,815
He got on the wrong bus.

00:39:22,815 --> 00:39:24,516
Where is he now?

00:39:24,516 --> 00:39:26,351
He's shuffling off to Buffalo.

00:39:26,351 --> 00:39:28,654
Unbelievable, isn't it?
The red tape.

00:39:28,654 --> 00:39:31,256
Could take months for him
to get back to Las Vegas.

00:39:31,256 --> 00:39:32,791
Well, I guess he won't be

00:39:32,791 --> 00:39:35,360
giving his brother
his kidney tomorrow, will he?

00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:38,497
It's tragic, isn't it?

00:39:38,497 --> 00:39:40,499

Okay.
