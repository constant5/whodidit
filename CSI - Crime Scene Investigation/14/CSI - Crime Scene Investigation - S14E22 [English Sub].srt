00:00:06,977 --> 00:00:08,979
Do you guys ever think
maybe we should

00:00:08,979 --> 00:00:10,214
fix up the shack a little?

00:00:10,214 --> 00:00:12,283
It's fine. Why fix it?
Yeah.

00:00:12,283 --> 00:00:13,584
I don't know;

00:00:13,584 --> 00:00:15,086
in case we ever bring girls
here or something.

00:00:15,086 --> 00:00:16,720
Scotty, what girls
are we gonna bring

00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,689
besides your mom
or your sister?

00:00:18,689 --> 00:00:21,225
You know what?
Fine. Never mind.

00:00:21,225 --> 00:00:24,028
Yo, guys.
The shack door's open.

00:00:32,536 --> 00:00:33,737
Is that blood?

00:00:33,737 --> 00:00:36,207
Oh, man, we should go.
Come on!

00:00:44,215 --> 00:00:47,118
Is he dead?

00:00:47,118 --> 00:00:49,720
He's not moving.

00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,956
That's a lot of blood.

00:00:51,956 --> 00:00:54,258
Looks like he got
shot or something.

00:00:54,258 --> 00:00:55,192
SCOTTY:
Whoa.

00:00:56,961 --> 00:00:58,629
Smooth move, ex-lax!

00:01:00,431 --> 00:01:03,000
You guys.

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,001
Money.

00:01:04,001 --> 00:01:05,703
And a lot of it.

00:01:07,304 --> 00:01:09,206
Holy crap.
We need to go call the cops.

00:01:09,206 --> 00:01:10,207
What?

00:01:10,207 --> 00:01:12,209
(coughing)

00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:13,511
(boys gasp)

00:01:13,511 --> 00:01:14,445
(gun cocks)

00:01:20,284 --> 00:01:22,419
Well, it doesn't look like
he's gonna be making

00:01:22,419 --> 00:01:25,122
that 3:10 to Yuma,
eh, Super Dave?

00:01:25,122 --> 00:01:26,423
I'd say he's caught
his last ride.

00:01:27,558 --> 00:01:30,027
Name is Roger Mathers,

00:01:30,027 --> 00:01:32,296
according to his
Texas driver's license.

00:01:32,296 --> 00:01:34,131
Single bullet wound
to the chest.

00:01:34,131 --> 00:01:37,268
STOKES: Nice powder ring
around the entry wound.

00:01:37,268 --> 00:01:39,537
It looks like he was hiking
in the desert,

00:01:39,537 --> 00:01:42,406
judging from all the dirt
and burrs in his socks.

00:01:42,406 --> 00:01:44,942
Yeah, well, there's no shortage
of that around here.

00:01:44,942 --> 00:01:45,976
No.

00:01:45,976 --> 00:01:47,244
BRASS:
Hey, Nicky!

00:01:47,244 --> 00:01:48,612
Hey, uh, give me a second,
will you?

00:01:48,612 --> 00:01:49,547
Yeah.

00:01:53,017 --> 00:01:55,119
This is, uh,
CSI Nick Stokes.

00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,121
This is Sheriff Combs.
He's the local law.

00:01:57,121 --> 00:01:58,489
Stokes.
How's it going?

00:01:58,489 --> 00:02:00,257
Sheriff was telling me
he knew the victim.

00:02:00,257 --> 00:02:01,625
But he's from Texas.
How'd you know him?

00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:03,727
Well, he might've been
living in Texas now,

00:02:03,727 --> 00:02:05,396
but Roger Mathers was
born and raised

00:02:05,396 --> 00:02:07,198
right here
in Ellis Springs.

00:02:07,198 --> 00:02:08,699
I knew him as a kid.

00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:10,401
BRASS: The sheriff
was telling me

00:02:10,401 --> 00:02:12,002
that the victim had
a moment of fame,

00:02:12,002 --> 00:02:13,671
or infamy, depending
upon how you look at it.

00:02:13,671 --> 00:02:15,372
Yeah, back when
they were kids,

00:02:15,372 --> 00:02:17,141
he and a couple of buddies,
they had the bad luck

00:02:17,141 --> 00:02:19,109
to run across
an armed robbery.

00:02:19,109 --> 00:02:20,945
One of the kids
got killed.

00:02:20,945 --> 00:02:23,948
Shook up the town
pretty bad.
(cell phone ringing)

00:02:23,948 --> 00:02:25,216
Excuse me, I got to take this.

00:02:25,216 --> 00:02:26,417
Yeah, go for Brass.

00:02:26,417 --> 00:02:27,718
So, Sheriff,
what do you think

00:02:27,718 --> 00:02:29,620
Roger might've been doing
back in town?

00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,322
And what the hell
was he doing way out here?

00:02:31,322 --> 00:02:34,024
Well, he wouldn't be the
first guy to come out here

00:02:34,024 --> 00:02:36,060
chasing a payday,
Mr. Stokes.

00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,063
Loot from the robbery
was never recovered.

00:02:39,063 --> 00:02:41,165
There's a million-dollar
treasure out here

00:02:41,165 --> 00:02:43,100
just waiting to be found.

00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:46,170
Local lore, they say it's
still out here somewhere.

00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:47,671
(chuckles):
Huh.

00:02:50,207 --> 00:02:51,642
What is it, Jim?

00:02:51,642 --> 00:02:53,377
That was about my daughter.

00:02:53,377 --> 00:02:54,645
What's wrong?

00:02:54,645 --> 00:02:58,549
She, uh, just tried
to kill herself.

We've got an O.D.
Female, late 20s.

00:03:35,619 --> 00:03:37,087
Attempted suicide.

00:03:37,087 --> 00:03:39,089
Cocktail of clozapine,
olanzapine.

00:03:39,089 --> 00:03:40,224
Breathing steady
but shallow.

00:03:40,224 --> 00:03:41,592
BP: 85/40.

00:03:41,592 --> 00:03:43,360
Get her into three
and throw up

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,695
another bag of ringers, stat.
Yes, Doctor.

00:03:44,695 --> 00:03:45,963
I'm sorry, sir.

00:03:45,963 --> 00:03:47,331
I'm Captain Jim Brass.

00:03:47,331 --> 00:03:48,966
Captain, I'm gonna
need you to wait.

00:03:48,966 --> 00:03:50,467
As soon as she's stable,
I'll find you.

00:03:54,505 --> 00:03:56,040
(sighs)

00:03:58,108 --> 00:03:59,977
We just heard. So sorry.

00:03:59,977 --> 00:04:01,045
How you doing?

00:04:01,045 --> 00:04:02,446
I don't know.

00:04:02,446 --> 00:04:05,516
D.A. said Ellie was here
for a preliminary hearing.

00:04:05,516 --> 00:04:06,984
She was in a holding cell.

00:04:06,984 --> 00:04:08,419
She was obviously
stockpiling her meds.

00:04:08,419 --> 00:04:10,287
I mean, I don't think
she wanted to kill herself.

00:04:10,287 --> 00:04:13,090
You know, her attorney is
filing an insanity plea.

00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:16,060
It might be some screwed-up way
of strengthening their case.

00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,329
Whatever's going on,
this is where you need to be.

00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:19,963
And don't even think about
the Ellis Springs case.

00:04:19,963 --> 00:04:21,231
We got it covered.

00:04:21,231 --> 00:04:22,733
You just take care
of things here.

00:04:22,733 --> 00:04:24,401
Thanks.

00:04:24,401 --> 00:04:26,337
(camera clicking,
indistinct police radio chatter)

00:04:28,405 --> 00:04:31,308
Hey, Sara, find anything in
the treasure hunter's car?

00:04:31,308 --> 00:04:34,611
Well, he wasn't a health
food nut, that's for sure.

00:04:34,611 --> 00:04:37,548
Looks like he ran a solar
business down in Plano.

00:04:37,548 --> 00:04:40,017
His name's on the back
as the company owner.

00:04:40,017 --> 00:04:41,518
Are you kidding me?

00:04:41,518 --> 00:04:43,020
Selling solar in Texas?

00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,955
What? Texas
doesn't have sun?

00:04:44,955 --> 00:04:45,989
(laughs)

00:04:45,989 --> 00:04:47,624
Texas has oil.

00:04:47,624 --> 00:04:49,560
When I was growing up, you
mention something like this,

00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,161
it was blasphemy.

00:04:51,161 --> 00:04:52,429
Well, these might put
your mind at ease.

00:04:52,429 --> 00:04:54,131
Gasoline receipts.

00:04:54,131 --> 00:04:56,166
Looking at the where
and the whens of his fill-ups,

00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:57,735
I would say
that he drove straight through

00:04:57,735 --> 00:04:59,203
from Texas to get here.

00:04:59,203 --> 00:05:00,704
Well, why was he
in such a hurry?

00:05:00,704 --> 00:05:02,005
I don't know.

00:05:02,005 --> 00:05:03,707
And what is that?
Piece of a photo.

00:05:03,707 --> 00:05:05,676
I found it on the ground
near the car.

00:05:05,676 --> 00:05:08,178
Can't find
the rest of it.

00:05:08,178 --> 00:05:10,247
Well, it kind of looks
like an aerial photo.

00:05:10,247 --> 00:05:11,615
Don't you think?

00:05:11,615 --> 00:05:12,649
Maybe the lore is true.

00:05:12,649 --> 00:05:14,351
Aerial photo of the area--

00:05:14,351 --> 00:05:16,653
could've been
the victim's treasure map.

00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,062
So I called on down
to Texas,

00:05:25,062 --> 00:05:26,730
and I spoke with someone
at the victim's company.

00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,632
Did they say why he
came racing up here?

00:05:28,632 --> 00:05:30,968
You know, my guess is,
he was racing away from there.

00:05:30,968 --> 00:05:32,336
Turns out, he had
serious money troubles.

00:05:32,336 --> 00:05:34,138
His company is going under.

00:05:34,138 --> 00:05:36,573
Got to say, if I found
a buried treasure,

00:05:36,573 --> 00:05:38,942
I'd spend it on something
far more exciting

00:05:38,942 --> 00:05:40,344
than saving my failing company.

00:05:40,344 --> 00:05:41,979
What do you got in mind?

00:05:41,979 --> 00:05:44,381
Like a crazy trip
or a sexy sports car.

00:05:44,381 --> 00:05:46,283
Something like that.
Uh-huh.

00:05:46,283 --> 00:05:48,218
So there are
definitely prints

00:05:48,218 --> 00:05:50,220
on that piece of photo
you brought in, but

00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,955
pretty much all of them
belong to the victim.

00:05:51,955 --> 00:05:53,190
Pretty much all of them?

00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,992
Well, there is
one partial print

00:05:54,992 --> 00:05:56,960
that's not his, but
it's not enough to run.

00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,163
It's interesting, though;
it looks like

00:05:59,163 --> 00:06:01,999
a tented arch pattern,
which is really rare.

00:06:01,999 --> 00:06:04,468
I mean, only, what, five percent
of the population has that.

00:06:04,468 --> 00:06:06,236
(cell phone chimes)

00:06:06,236 --> 00:06:09,239
Well, Nick just got
the phone records of our victim.

00:06:09,239 --> 00:06:11,942
He made five calls
on his drive from Texas to here,

00:06:11,942 --> 00:06:13,377
all of them to Tyson Briggs.

00:06:13,377 --> 00:06:14,978
Who's Tyson Briggs?

00:06:14,978 --> 00:06:16,213
He's one of the other two kids

00:06:16,213 --> 00:06:18,382
that got tangled
in the heist 25 years ago.

00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:22,619
So were you and
Roger still close?

00:06:22,619 --> 00:06:24,254
You guys still talk?

00:06:24,254 --> 00:06:25,622
No, not really.

00:06:25,622 --> 00:06:28,425
Everything changed
after that day.

00:06:28,425 --> 00:06:29,626
That's why it was so weird,

00:06:29,626 --> 00:06:31,195
him calling
out of the blue like that.

00:06:31,195 --> 00:06:32,563
What'd he want?

00:06:32,563 --> 00:06:34,064
Wanted to get together.

00:06:34,064 --> 00:06:35,432
And did you?
Yeah.

00:06:35,432 --> 00:06:37,334
I thought it'd be good
to see him, you know?

00:06:37,334 --> 00:06:38,402
Get caught up.

00:06:41,004 --> 00:06:44,241
But all Roger could
talk about was money.

00:06:44,241 --> 00:06:46,243
He was kind of frantic.

00:06:46,243 --> 00:06:48,378
Panicked, even.

00:06:48,378 --> 00:06:50,080
He must've been
in a pretty deep hole.

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,216
Was he talking about
looking for buried treasure?

00:06:52,216 --> 00:06:54,518
You know, the money
from the '89 heist?

00:06:54,518 --> 00:06:57,321
That was why he was here;
that's why he came back.

00:06:57,321 --> 00:07:00,224
<i>That money was gonna be</i>
<i>the answer to all his problems.</i>

00:07:00,224 --> 00:07:01,658
STOKES:
<i>Hmm.</i>

00:07:01,658 --> 00:07:04,561
Well, how would he know
where to look for it?

00:07:04,561 --> 00:07:06,363
Well, he didn't say.

00:07:06,363 --> 00:07:09,233
And tell you the truth, man,
I really wasn't that interested.

00:07:11,735 --> 00:07:14,238
Look, man, I'm not trying
to talk bad about the guy now.

00:07:14,238 --> 00:07:15,739
No, that's all right.
I understand. Go ahead.

00:07:15,739 --> 00:07:17,574
The whole time me and Roger
were together,

00:07:17,574 --> 00:07:19,643
he didn't once mention Scotty.

00:07:19,643 --> 00:07:21,411
He just kept going on
about the money

00:07:21,411 --> 00:07:23,547
and the treasure
and how bad he needed it, man.

00:07:23,547 --> 00:07:26,683
He didn't... man, he didn't
have one single thought

00:07:26,683 --> 00:07:28,485
about Scotty.

00:07:28,485 --> 00:07:31,154
And, Scotty, that's the...
the boy who was killed?

00:07:31,154 --> 00:07:33,991
Yeah, we lost
our best friend that day.

00:07:35,292 --> 00:07:37,694
Please, mister,
don't shoot us!

00:07:37,694 --> 00:07:39,530
We won't tell anyone.

00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:40,731
(gunshot)

00:07:43,233 --> 00:07:44,568
MAN:
Ben!

00:07:44,568 --> 00:07:46,570
What the hell?

00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:48,171
What are you guys doing?

00:07:48,171 --> 00:07:50,207
We just came here to
hang out, mister, I...

00:07:50,207 --> 00:07:51,475
Shut up!

00:07:54,011 --> 00:07:55,212
Hey, bro.

00:07:55,212 --> 00:07:57,114
It's the best
I could do.

00:07:57,114 --> 00:07:58,248
I couldn't go
back to town.

00:08:00,584 --> 00:08:02,352
Hey, hey.

00:08:02,352 --> 00:08:03,453
Ben!

00:08:03,453 --> 00:08:05,455
No! Damn it!

00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:10,193
You.

00:08:10,193 --> 00:08:12,195
Grab the bags.
You're coming with me.

00:08:12,195 --> 00:08:13,430
Get over there!
No. No, please!

00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:14,431
I don't want to go!
(grunts)

00:08:16,266 --> 00:08:19,469
Pick up the money now!

00:08:19,469 --> 00:08:21,471
You two are gonna stay here.

00:08:21,471 --> 00:08:23,707
Be quiet
or your friend here dies.

00:08:23,707 --> 00:08:24,708
You get it?

00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:26,109
(crying):
Guys!

00:08:26,109 --> 00:08:27,978
Shut up.
Pick up the money!

00:08:27,978 --> 00:08:30,113
Pick it up!
(whimpering)

00:08:30,113 --> 00:08:32,349
Guys! Guys!

00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:34,484
Guys! Guys!

00:08:34,484 --> 00:08:36,486
Guys, help!

00:08:36,486 --> 00:08:39,222
We ran as fast as we could
back to town

00:08:39,222 --> 00:08:40,657
to get the sheriff.

00:08:40,657 --> 00:08:43,160
By that time,
it was too late.

00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,529
We never saw Scotty again.

00:08:45,529 --> 00:08:49,099
I grew up with
two great friends, man.

00:08:49,099 --> 00:08:51,034
You know, the kind
you never forget.

00:08:51,034 --> 00:08:54,104
Now they're both gone.

00:08:54,104 --> 00:08:56,340
Well, I'm sorry for
your loss, Mr. Briggs.

00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,675
Yeah, yeah.

00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:04,948
SIDLE:
<i>I just heard about Ellie.</i>

00:09:04,948 --> 00:09:07,017
How is she?

00:09:07,017 --> 00:09:09,419
She's in an induced coma.

00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:11,955
She's stable, so...

00:09:11,955 --> 00:09:13,523
How are you holding up?

00:09:13,523 --> 00:09:15,225
After all that's happened,

00:09:15,225 --> 00:09:17,160
I don't even know
what the hell I'm doing here.

00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,964
There's a part of me that wishes
she would just not wake up.

00:09:20,964 --> 00:09:25,235
I mean, I know how horrible
that sounds, but, uh...

00:09:25,235 --> 00:09:29,006
She's put you
through a lot, Jim.

00:09:29,006 --> 00:09:32,142
You know she's here
for a court hearing, right?

00:09:32,142 --> 00:09:34,011
She's gonna
testify in a court

00:09:34,011 --> 00:09:36,313
that I drove her to madness,

00:09:36,313 --> 00:09:38,382
to murder.

00:09:38,382 --> 00:09:40,651
You are not responsible
for what she did

00:09:40,651 --> 00:09:43,453
or what she's done
to herself.

00:09:43,453 --> 00:09:45,322
I'm not so sure.

00:09:47,991 --> 00:09:50,193
So what do we got
on our murdered treasure hunter?

00:09:50,193 --> 00:09:52,095
Well, we are working
on that right now.

00:09:52,095 --> 00:09:55,599
We just pulled all the files
from the original '89 case.

00:09:55,599 --> 00:09:58,201
These were
our suspects involved,

00:09:58,201 --> 00:09:59,703
a pair of local brothers,

00:09:59,703 --> 00:10:01,438
Paul and Ben O'Malley.

00:10:01,438 --> 00:10:05,676
They robbed the house of
a mid-level Mob boss

00:10:05,676 --> 00:10:07,244
named Michael Scarno,

00:10:07,244 --> 00:10:10,714
and in the process,
one of them was shot.

00:10:10,714 --> 00:10:12,683
According to the police report,
they made off

00:10:12,683 --> 00:10:14,985
with close to a hundred grand
and some valuables.

00:10:14,985 --> 00:10:16,453
That's all?

00:10:16,453 --> 00:10:19,489
Nick talked like there was
this big treasure involved.

00:10:19,489 --> 00:10:22,092
Well, the cash and
watches are part

00:10:22,092 --> 00:10:24,061
of the official
theft report.

00:10:24,061 --> 00:10:26,730
But I remember
when I was writing

00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:29,232
my Vegas mob book,
I heard about

00:10:29,232 --> 00:10:31,501
this Michael Scarno.

00:10:31,501 --> 00:10:33,236
He was an art theft guy,

00:10:33,236 --> 00:10:37,107
and he had acquired a
particular piece of sculpture.

00:10:37,107 --> 00:10:39,710
A Persian stone lion.

00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:42,212
Wow, that's over
2,000 years old.

00:10:42,212 --> 00:10:44,114
And it was just one of a pair.

00:10:44,114 --> 00:10:46,049
The other one just sold
at a British auction

00:10:46,049 --> 00:10:48,185
for close to $10 million.

00:10:48,185 --> 00:10:51,455
FINLAY: Well, that could
explain the "why now" of it all.

00:10:51,455 --> 00:10:53,590
Could be that our victim
heard about the auction

00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:55,659
and then went looking
for the remaining statue.

00:10:55,659 --> 00:10:58,061
How do the three local kids
fit into the original story?

00:10:58,061 --> 00:11:00,230
Wrong place at the wrong time.

00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:03,600
The older O'Malley found them
in a railroad shack.

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,168
Brother was dead.

00:11:05,168 --> 00:11:06,603
O'Malley then tried
to make a getaway

00:11:06,603 --> 00:11:08,705
and took one of
the younger kids with him.

00:11:08,705 --> 00:11:10,340
Scotty Gates.

00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,442
SANDERS: O'Malley was caught
two hours later

00:11:12,442 --> 00:11:15,145
out near Hoover Dam,
but by then

00:11:15,145 --> 00:11:17,447
the boy and the cash
were gone.

00:11:17,447 --> 00:11:18,982
Now, the sheriff
has always contended

00:11:18,982 --> 00:11:22,018
that the kid ended up at
the bottom of Lake Mead.

00:11:22,018 --> 00:11:23,487
The body was never found?

00:11:23,487 --> 00:11:25,489
O'Malley didn't say
what he did with the kid?

00:11:25,489 --> 00:11:27,190
He never got a chance to.

00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:29,459
He was found dead in
his jail cell the next morning.

00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:32,362
No body. No money. No trial.

00:11:32,362 --> 00:11:34,631
Seems a little bit more
than sketchy, don't you think?

00:11:34,631 --> 00:11:37,067
Case of small-town
justice, maybe?

00:11:37,067 --> 00:11:38,635
Or small-town corruption.

00:11:38,635 --> 00:11:40,737
Maybe the local cops knew
what kind of stash

00:11:40,737 --> 00:11:42,372
Scarno was sitting on.

00:11:42,372 --> 00:11:45,308
FINLAY: So this is
what's left of Scotty Gates.

00:11:45,308 --> 00:11:46,476
An entire kid's
existence

00:11:46,476 --> 00:11:49,980
comes down to a baseball hat

00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,982
and a pair of glasses.

00:11:51,982 --> 00:11:53,517
Oh, I can't even imagine

00:11:53,517 --> 00:11:55,185
what his parents
must've been going through.

00:11:55,185 --> 00:11:57,587
Wait a minute.

00:11:57,587 --> 00:12:00,390
Looks like a partial print.

00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:01,591
It could be a tented arch.

00:12:01,591 --> 00:12:02,726
Sara said

00:12:02,726 --> 00:12:04,394
she found a tented arch

00:12:04,394 --> 00:12:06,096
at the Roger Mathers
murder scene.

00:12:06,096 --> 00:12:08,431
SIDLE:
I got your text.
You said it was urgent.

00:12:08,431 --> 00:12:11,401
I was looking through
the evidence from the '89 case,

00:12:11,401 --> 00:12:13,203
and I found
a fingerprint.

00:12:13,203 --> 00:12:15,505
It's only a partial,
not enough to run.

00:12:15,505 --> 00:12:17,407
Don't tell me
it has a tented arch.

00:12:17,407 --> 00:12:19,042
It does.

00:12:19,042 --> 00:12:20,677
Okay, so the one
on the left

00:12:20,677 --> 00:12:22,712
is from the torn photo that
you guys found this morning,

00:12:22,712 --> 00:12:24,648
and the one
on the right

00:12:24,648 --> 00:12:28,118
is from Scotty Gates' glasses
25 years ago.

00:12:28,118 --> 00:12:29,186
Could they really be the same?

00:12:31,188 --> 00:12:32,222
It's a match.

00:12:34,357 --> 00:12:37,027
FINLAY: The fingerprint belongs
to a man named Sam Bishop.

00:12:37,027 --> 00:12:38,562
He is a security
guard now,

00:12:38,562 --> 00:12:40,463
but back in '89, he was a deputy

00:12:40,463 --> 00:12:42,566
in Ellis Springs
under Sheriff Combs.

00:12:42,566 --> 00:12:44,634
And get this--
he left the department

00:12:44,634 --> 00:12:48,338
two weeks after the whole thing
with Scotty Gates and the heist.

00:12:48,338 --> 00:12:52,442
Goes a long way to support
our theory of a crooked cop.

00:12:52,442 --> 00:12:55,312
We have his fingerprints
at both murder scenes.

00:12:55,312 --> 00:12:57,347
RUSSELL:
Could be our killer, I guess,

00:12:57,347 --> 00:12:59,449
covering up his crimes
of the past.

00:13:01,151 --> 00:13:02,352
AKERS:
Let's take the back.

00:13:04,054 --> 00:13:05,689
Can I help you with something?

00:13:05,689 --> 00:13:07,424
Uh, LVPD. Who are you?

00:13:07,424 --> 00:13:09,159
Karen Bishop. I live here.

00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:11,328
SANDERS:
We're looking for Sam Bishop.

00:13:11,328 --> 00:13:12,362
We'd like to have
a word with him.

00:13:12,362 --> 00:13:14,631
Um... yeah.

00:13:14,631 --> 00:13:16,166
I'll let him know you're here.

00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:18,201
No, no. You know what?
That's fine.

00:13:18,201 --> 00:13:19,669
We'll tell him ourselves.
Thank you.

00:13:19,669 --> 00:13:21,037
KAREN: Excuse me,
you can't go in there.

00:13:21,037 --> 00:13:21,972
AKERS:
Ma'am.

00:13:23,573 --> 00:13:25,175
STOKES:
Sam Bishop?

00:13:25,175 --> 00:13:27,110
LVPD. We need to talk.

00:13:30,046 --> 00:13:33,049
Let me guess--
about Scotty Gates' murder?

00:13:33,049 --> 00:13:36,119
I've been waiting 25 years
for you to come.

00:13:44,361 --> 00:13:46,196
You boys are arresting me?
You got to be kidding me.

00:13:46,196 --> 00:13:48,231
We've got your prints at
two murder scenes, Mr. Bishop:

00:13:48,231 --> 00:13:51,735
Roger Mathers' last night and
Scotty Gates' 25 years ago.

00:13:51,735 --> 00:13:53,036
What the hell
are you talking about?

00:13:53,036 --> 00:13:54,371
My father

00:13:54,371 --> 00:13:56,039
wasn't involved
in any murder.

00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:57,707
We have a warrant to search
the premises as well.

00:13:57,707 --> 00:14:00,110
You have absolutely no idea
what you're doing, do you?

00:14:01,111 --> 00:14:03,280
Get him out of here.

00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:06,249
You're making a huge mistake.

00:14:06,249 --> 00:14:07,550
My father is a good man.

00:14:09,386 --> 00:14:11,421
Well, we'll have a look
around, see for ourselves.

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,502
The gun that was used

00:14:25,502 --> 00:14:27,704
to kill Roger Mathers
was a nine-mil, right?

00:14:27,704 --> 00:14:29,506
Yeah, but if it's
hidden down here,

00:14:29,506 --> 00:14:31,274
we got our work
cut out for us.

00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:48,692
SANDERS:
Am I the only one getting

00:14:48,692 --> 00:14:50,660
a mad scientist vibe in here?

00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:53,063
Thought this guy
was a former cop.

00:14:57,267 --> 00:14:59,202
Ooh, have a look
at this.

00:15:06,443 --> 00:15:08,378
These are the boys
from the '89 case.

00:15:08,378 --> 00:15:10,046
STOKES:
Old rabbit's foot.

00:15:11,648 --> 00:15:13,616
Like a kid would have.

00:15:13,616 --> 00:15:16,419
Could be a trophy the killer
kept from Scotty Gates.

00:15:16,419 --> 00:15:19,422
Well, it's got
an evidence tag on it.

00:15:21,992 --> 00:15:23,693
And these are all
old case files.

00:15:23,693 --> 00:15:27,998
Just who the hell
is this guy?

00:15:27,998 --> 00:15:29,432
I'm assuming your people
didn't find

00:15:29,432 --> 00:15:31,167
any murder weapon
in my house.

00:15:31,167 --> 00:15:32,569
No, they didn't,
Mr. Bishop.

00:15:32,569 --> 00:15:35,305
But what they did find
was-was very interesting.

00:15:35,305 --> 00:15:38,575
You're one of us,
a criminalist.

00:15:38,575 --> 00:15:41,678
You were working for Ellis
Springs Sheriff Department

00:15:41,678 --> 00:15:43,713
back in 1989.

00:15:43,713 --> 00:15:45,281
They called me a "hobbyist,"
actually.

00:15:45,281 --> 00:15:47,951
Well, that was
a pretty heavy responsibility

00:15:47,951 --> 00:15:49,052
for a young deputy.

00:15:49,052 --> 00:15:50,353
How'd that land
on your back?

00:15:50,353 --> 00:15:51,621
I volunteered.

00:15:51,621 --> 00:15:53,323
I had a knack for science.

00:15:53,323 --> 00:15:54,724
We're working an investigation

00:15:54,724 --> 00:15:57,193
into a murder that
took place last night.

00:15:57,193 --> 00:16:00,330
Your fingerprint was
on a torn photograph

00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:02,065
recovered at the scene.

00:16:02,065 --> 00:16:03,333
Can you explain that?

00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:05,201
I retired years ago.

00:16:05,201 --> 00:16:07,337
Maybe you should
figure that one out.

00:16:07,337 --> 00:16:08,471
RUSSELL:
You didn't retire.

00:16:08,471 --> 00:16:09,973
You were fired.

00:16:09,973 --> 00:16:12,308
You were let go right after
the 1989 heist,

00:16:12,308 --> 00:16:14,577
says here in your file,
for insubordination.

00:16:14,577 --> 00:16:15,979
There was no
insubordination.

00:16:15,979 --> 00:16:17,614
I found evidence

00:16:17,614 --> 00:16:20,717
that was, uh...
inconvenient for Sheriff Combs.

00:16:20,717 --> 00:16:22,385
Quickest way
to bury my evidence

00:16:22,385 --> 00:16:24,054
was to bury me.

00:16:24,054 --> 00:16:25,955
Why was the evidence
inconvenient for the sheriff?

00:16:25,955 --> 00:16:27,490
Most charitable scenario?

00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:30,226
Local kid was gone,
presumed dead,

00:16:30,226 --> 00:16:32,996
along with
the two men responsible.

00:16:32,996 --> 00:16:34,597
Sheriff just wanted
the case closed.

00:16:34,597 --> 00:16:36,199
Least charitable scenario?

00:16:36,199 --> 00:16:39,002
Sheriff was dirty,
in on the heist.

00:16:39,002 --> 00:16:41,471
I suppose you have
some evidence to back that up?

00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,473
Ben and Paul O'Malley.

00:16:43,473 --> 00:16:45,341
Two brothers that ripped off
Michael Scarno's house.

00:16:45,341 --> 00:16:47,410
BISHOP: They were local
troublemakers back then.

00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:50,713
Got arrested half a dozen times.

00:16:50,713 --> 00:16:54,384
More than once, Sheriff Combs
arranged for them

00:16:54,384 --> 00:16:56,219
to serve their time
working on his house.

00:16:56,219 --> 00:16:58,154
So you're saying
that he knew them well.

00:16:58,154 --> 00:17:00,657
Well enough he could've hired
them to pull off the robbery.

00:17:00,657 --> 00:17:02,325
ECKLIE:
<i>Let's be careful</i>

00:17:02,325 --> 00:17:04,961
about allegations that
Sheriff Combs is dirty.

00:17:04,961 --> 00:17:07,197
Guy has over 30 years
under his belt.

00:17:07,197 --> 00:17:09,232
Yeah, well, 30 years
doesn't take away his guilt

00:17:09,232 --> 00:17:11,501
if he was involved in the
original robbery and murder.

00:17:11,501 --> 00:17:12,735
But we don't know that.

00:17:12,735 --> 00:17:16,139
Come here.
Come here.

00:17:16,139 --> 00:17:17,674
Let's say I play along.

00:17:17,674 --> 00:17:19,609
Let's say Sheriff Combs
was involved

00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:22,479
in the original robbery, which
ties him to the kid's death.

00:17:22,479 --> 00:17:25,415
Why would he kill Roger Mathers
25 years after the fact?

00:17:25,415 --> 00:17:26,983
Maybe Roger and the kids

00:17:26,983 --> 00:17:29,018
saw more that day
than we realized.

00:17:29,018 --> 00:17:32,689
Now, Roger has come back.
He's desperate for money.

00:17:32,689 --> 00:17:34,257
Maybe his next move

00:17:34,257 --> 00:17:36,292
is to try
to blackmail the sheriff.

00:17:36,292 --> 00:17:38,995
That's two "maybes"
in three sentences.

00:17:38,995 --> 00:17:40,497
It does give him motive.

00:17:40,497 --> 00:17:42,132
Look, I'm not
in the man's corner.

00:17:42,132 --> 00:17:44,968
I'm just saying,
proceed with caution.

00:17:48,538 --> 00:17:50,273
This guy, Sam Bishop--

00:17:50,273 --> 00:17:51,608
I'm looking at
the forensics he was doing.

00:17:51,608 --> 00:17:53,076
It's crazy.

00:17:53,076 --> 00:17:55,345
I mean, he was way, way
ahead of his time.

00:17:55,345 --> 00:17:57,213
Polymorphic protein analysis,

00:17:57,213 --> 00:17:58,982
analyzing gunshot residue.

00:17:58,982 --> 00:18:01,618
He has his own formulas here
for amino acid stains.

00:18:01,618 --> 00:18:02,986
Wow.

00:18:02,986 --> 00:18:05,321
I found all of these

00:18:05,321 --> 00:18:07,290
aerial photos in Bishop's box.

00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:09,058
They look a lot like the piece

00:18:09,058 --> 00:18:10,960
you found by
the victim's car,

00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,163
but, I mean, there's not one
that's a perfect match.

00:18:13,163 --> 00:18:15,165
There's not one with
a... with a tear on it

00:18:15,165 --> 00:18:17,066
or anything like that,
which means

00:18:17,066 --> 00:18:19,402
Roger Mathers had the only copy.

00:18:19,402 --> 00:18:21,104
He had the only treasure map.

00:18:21,104 --> 00:18:23,406
Explains why Sam Bishop's
fingerprint was on it.

00:18:23,406 --> 00:18:25,041
It was one of his photos.

00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:28,278
Question is,
how did Roger Mathers get it?

00:18:28,278 --> 00:18:30,313
RUSSELL:
Sam, these were your photos.

00:18:30,313 --> 00:18:33,416
That's why your fingerprint's
on the fragment that we found

00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:35,151
near Roger Mathers' car.

00:18:35,151 --> 00:18:37,420
Did you give him
this photograph?

00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:40,223
No. And I have no idea
how he got it.

00:18:40,223 --> 00:18:42,025
These are all
original case photos.

00:18:42,025 --> 00:18:44,294
Been sitting in the same
evidence box for 25 years.

00:18:44,294 --> 00:18:46,162
Very impressive, actually.

00:18:46,162 --> 00:18:49,566
It's the kind of mapping
we do with drones nowadays.

00:18:49,566 --> 00:18:52,502
But you didn't have a drone
back then, did you?

00:18:52,502 --> 00:18:53,603
No.

00:18:53,603 --> 00:18:56,072
But I had this.

00:18:56,072 --> 00:18:58,441
<i>I mounted a camera</i>
<i>from a suspension rig</i>

00:18:58,441 --> 00:19:01,211
<i>slung beneath</i>
<i>a weather balloon.</i>

00:19:01,211 --> 00:19:03,112
<i>The camera's self-timer</i>
<i>was modified</i>

00:19:03,112 --> 00:19:06,583
<i>to fire off an entire roll</i>
<i>of film automatically.</i>

00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:08,618
<i>Took about a week</i>
<i>to map the region.</i>

00:19:08,618 --> 00:19:11,254
<i>There was no better way to</i>
<i>search for Scotty Gates' body.</i>

00:19:11,254 --> 00:19:14,224
Yeah, I'm-I'm gonna
stop you right there, Sam.

00:19:14,224 --> 00:19:16,960
See, I had a conversation
with Michael Scarno's attorney.

00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,329
Discovered
an interesting connection

00:19:19,329 --> 00:19:21,731
between you and
the old crime boss.

00:19:21,731 --> 00:19:24,601
He paid you
for those photos, Sam,

00:19:24,601 --> 00:19:27,036
and that was after you got fired
by Sheriff Combs.

00:19:27,036 --> 00:19:28,504
Hold on a minute--

00:19:28,504 --> 00:19:30,373
You weren't looking
for the kid's body.

00:19:30,373 --> 00:19:33,476
Scarno hired you
to find his missing loot,

00:19:33,476 --> 00:19:35,144
his treasure.
No, you don't understand...

00:19:35,144 --> 00:19:37,080
Are you going to deny
that you were

00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,349
on Scarno's payroll?

00:19:39,349 --> 00:19:40,550
No, I'm not.

00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:44,487
Yes, I took the old man's money.

00:19:44,487 --> 00:19:47,523
I'd just been fired.
I had a little girl to raise.

00:19:47,523 --> 00:19:48,958
But I never
gave a damn

00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:51,127
about any missing loot,
any treasure.

00:19:51,127 --> 00:19:54,063
It was a chance to find Scotty.

00:19:55,965 --> 00:19:57,700
Sam, we need the photo

00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:00,403
that Roger Mathers had
last night.

00:20:00,403 --> 00:20:02,272
Where are the negatives?

00:20:03,473 --> 00:20:05,174
BRODY:
There it is,

00:20:05,174 --> 00:20:06,709
the photograph that
Roger Mathers was carrying

00:20:06,709 --> 00:20:08,077
the night he was murdered.

00:20:08,077 --> 00:20:09,545
HODGES:
The question is,

00:20:09,545 --> 00:20:11,581
what's so damn special about it
that got him killed?

00:20:11,581 --> 00:20:13,950
Sam Bishop must have
scoured these photos

00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,251
back when he took them.

00:20:15,251 --> 00:20:16,653
He didn't see anything.

00:20:16,653 --> 00:20:19,055
Yeah, but he was working
with 1989 technology.

00:20:25,194 --> 00:20:26,996
HODGES:
Whoa. Hold it.

00:20:26,996 --> 00:20:28,331
Do you see that?

00:20:28,331 --> 00:20:30,566
There's an irregular
pattern in the ground.

00:20:30,566 --> 00:20:32,535
Looks like the dirt
had been recently turned over.

00:20:32,535 --> 00:20:35,638
I can run this against
a current satellite photo,

00:20:35,638 --> 00:20:37,373
get the GPS coordinates.

00:20:48,418 --> 00:20:50,386
SANDERS:
Well, we got to be close.

00:20:50,386 --> 00:20:53,056
Coordinates we have
put us just about

00:20:53,056 --> 00:20:55,291
on top of it.

00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:57,527
Yeah. I think we're there.

00:21:02,699 --> 00:21:04,467
SANDERS:
This is recent.

00:21:06,569 --> 00:21:08,304
Yeah. This hole
looks fresh.

00:21:08,304 --> 00:21:10,707
Look at the impression
in the dirt here.

00:21:10,707 --> 00:21:12,709
Could be from the lion statue.

00:21:12,709 --> 00:21:14,477
Someone beat us to the treasure.

00:21:16,713 --> 00:21:18,948
Greg.

00:21:22,318 --> 00:21:25,488
Looks like a tennis shoe.

00:21:25,488 --> 00:21:27,090
Or it was, a long time ago.

00:21:29,092 --> 00:21:30,626
SANDERS:
That's a bone.

00:21:30,626 --> 00:21:32,362
Wasn't just the treasure
that's buried here.

00:21:33,463 --> 00:21:36,265
No.

00:21:36,265 --> 00:21:37,967
This is Scotty Gates' grave.

00:21:43,573 --> 00:21:45,141
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

00:21:49,545 --> 00:21:51,314
Here's the cast
I pulled from the hole

00:21:51,314 --> 00:21:52,949
before they
started digging.

00:21:52,949 --> 00:21:55,618
Sure looks like a match
for the lion statue to me.

00:21:55,618 --> 00:21:57,720
SIDLE: Yeah, we found
a shovel too.

00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,489
So Scotty Gates
and the statue

00:21:59,489 --> 00:22:01,324
were buried right here
all this time.

00:22:01,324 --> 00:22:02,658
I thought the story was that

00:22:02,658 --> 00:22:04,327
the kid ended up
on the bottom of Lake Mead.

00:22:04,327 --> 00:22:06,629
Well, that's what
Sheriff Combs has always said.

00:22:06,629 --> 00:22:09,098
Then again, I mean,
you heard Sam Bishop's theory.

00:22:09,098 --> 00:22:10,700
The sheriff was in on the heist.

00:22:12,368 --> 00:22:13,536
Speak of the devil.

00:22:20,943 --> 00:22:23,479
So I have to hear
through radio traffic

00:22:23,479 --> 00:22:25,214
that you discovered
a grave.

00:22:25,214 --> 00:22:27,216
We're still in
the early stages.

00:22:27,216 --> 00:22:30,486
If the remains you're digging up
there are Scotty Gates,

00:22:30,486 --> 00:22:33,356
I am still the lead detective
on that case.

00:22:33,356 --> 00:22:35,691
Sheriff, right now, this is
part of our investigation

00:22:35,691 --> 00:22:38,227
into the murder of
Roger Mathers.

00:22:38,227 --> 00:22:39,629
And you found
no other evidence

00:22:39,629 --> 00:22:41,497
that would indicate
this is part of my case?

00:22:41,497 --> 00:22:43,533
You mean like
a million-dollar statue?

00:22:45,101 --> 00:22:46,302
Everything here
is going back to our lab.

00:22:46,302 --> 00:22:47,470
We'll let you know what we find.

00:22:54,143 --> 00:22:57,346
BISHOP: All these years, he was
just a half-mile from town.

00:22:57,346 --> 00:22:59,682
I should have found him.

00:23:02,985 --> 00:23:06,088
Scotty's parents were devastated
by his disappearance.

00:23:06,088 --> 00:23:07,156
Whole town was.

00:23:07,156 --> 00:23:08,458
But his mother--

00:23:08,458 --> 00:23:11,727
it just pushed her
over the edge.

00:23:11,727 --> 00:23:13,229
For weeks and months,

00:23:13,229 --> 00:23:15,097
she posted his picture
all over town.

00:23:15,097 --> 00:23:17,099
She never stopped
looking for him,

00:23:17,099 --> 00:23:21,571
even though, in her heart,
I think she knew he was dead.

00:23:21,571 --> 00:23:25,041
RUSSELL:
Hard to grieve without knowing
what happened.

00:23:25,041 --> 00:23:26,409
I promised her
I'd find Scotty.

00:23:26,409 --> 00:23:29,645
Did everything I could,
but in the end...

00:23:29,645 --> 00:23:31,647
I let her down.

00:23:31,647 --> 00:23:35,084
Sam, I want to apologize to you

00:23:35,084 --> 00:23:37,019
for the assumptions
I made earlier.

00:23:38,554 --> 00:23:40,389
(door opens)
ROBBINS:
Gentlemen.

00:23:40,389 --> 00:23:41,591
Doc.

00:23:41,591 --> 00:23:44,026
I spoke with
the forensic odontologist.

00:23:44,026 --> 00:23:46,162
Dental records
confirm the remains

00:23:46,162 --> 00:23:48,331
are definitely those
of Scotty Gates.

00:23:48,331 --> 00:23:49,398
RUSSELL:
Okay, thanks.

00:23:49,398 --> 00:23:51,033
Anything else
you can tell us?

00:23:51,033 --> 00:23:52,401
Well, obviously, my observations

00:23:52,401 --> 00:23:54,437
are limited by
the advanced decomposition.

00:23:54,437 --> 00:23:56,372
Cause of death
out of the question?

00:23:56,372 --> 00:23:57,974
Not necessarily.

00:23:57,974 --> 00:24:00,543
I noticed some
fracturing here

00:24:00,543 --> 00:24:02,178
and an indentation.

00:24:02,178 --> 00:24:03,646
First, I thought
it was the result

00:24:03,646 --> 00:24:05,548
of the body being buried
for 25 years.

00:24:05,548 --> 00:24:07,550
But on closer look,

00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:09,652
there seems to be
some impact compression.

00:24:09,652 --> 00:24:11,621
Someone struck him in the head.

00:24:11,621 --> 00:24:14,123
Or he fell and hit his head;
it's hard to say which.

00:24:14,123 --> 00:24:15,157
Do you mind?

00:24:15,157 --> 00:24:17,627
No.

00:24:17,627 --> 00:24:21,330
So this jagged mark here,
that's the line of impact?

00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:23,366
ROBBINS:
Yeah, you can see the
compression I mentioned.

00:24:23,366 --> 00:24:25,301
What do you think?

00:24:25,301 --> 00:24:26,636
It matches the base
of the statue.

00:24:26,636 --> 00:24:28,104
Mm-hmm.

00:24:28,104 --> 00:24:29,705
Scotty was killed
with the stone lion.

00:24:29,705 --> 00:24:33,709
Whoever buried that
was not hiding treasure.

00:24:33,709 --> 00:24:36,279
They were ditching
their murder weapon.

00:24:39,282 --> 00:24:41,250
(monitor beeping steadily)

00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:43,619
BRASS:
Ellie.

00:24:43,619 --> 00:24:46,122
How did we get here, huh?

00:24:46,122 --> 00:24:49,992
How did we get here
to this place?

00:24:54,196 --> 00:24:57,567
Was it because I wasn't
your real father?

00:24:57,567 --> 00:24:59,101
I mean, we never
told you;

00:24:59,101 --> 00:25:00,570
we didn't think
it was a big deal.

00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:03,039
But maybe you
instinctively knew

00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,640
and you held it
against me.

00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,409
Is that it?

00:25:06,409 --> 00:25:09,111
Is...

00:25:09,111 --> 00:25:13,082
I mean, the natural connection
between a father and daughter,

00:25:13,082 --> 00:25:15,017
the bond-- we never had that.

00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,056
Was it because
we didn't love each other?

00:25:23,993 --> 00:25:26,495
I mean, I thought I loved you.

00:25:26,495 --> 00:25:28,998
I mean, every time
you were in trouble,

00:25:28,998 --> 00:25:30,600
I was there.

00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,234
I came.

00:25:32,234 --> 00:25:34,437
Tried to save you, help you.

00:25:34,437 --> 00:25:36,639
I mean, if that's not love...

00:25:36,639 --> 00:25:40,109
I-I don't know
what love is, then.

00:25:40,109 --> 00:25:44,113
But you kept pushing me away
and pushing me away.

00:25:44,113 --> 00:25:46,048
And now we're here.

00:25:49,619 --> 00:25:51,487
I can't go on like this, Ellie.

00:26:00,329 --> 00:26:02,231
I think
I've discovered a secret

00:26:02,231 --> 00:26:04,000
about the most beautiful
woman in history.

00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,001
Kate Upton?

00:26:05,001 --> 00:26:06,502
In history, Henry.

00:26:06,502 --> 00:26:08,270
I was talking about Cleopatra.

00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:10,973
Oh. Fascinating,
but I am busy.

00:26:10,973 --> 00:26:13,209
I just came to tell you
that I had no luck

00:26:13,209 --> 00:26:14,477
isolating DNA
from the shovel

00:26:14,477 --> 00:26:15,645
Greg and Sara found
by the hole.

00:26:15,645 --> 00:26:18,114
Something in the sample

00:26:18,114 --> 00:26:20,249
screwed up your extraction,
didn't it?

00:26:20,249 --> 00:26:22,585
Just as Cleopatra
and I expected.

00:26:22,585 --> 00:26:25,254
(sighs)
Fine, I'll bite.

00:26:25,254 --> 00:26:27,456
What does my screwed-up sample
have to do with Cleopatra?

00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:29,692
Minerals from
the Dead Sea,

00:26:29,692 --> 00:26:32,428
13 of them not found in water
anywhere else in the world.

00:26:32,428 --> 00:26:34,664
As usual, I'm not
following you.

00:26:34,664 --> 00:26:37,600
There was lotion
on the shovel handle.

00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,603
The sample contained
a particular proportion

00:26:40,603 --> 00:26:44,273
of magnesium, bromide,
bitumen, calcium, and potassium.

00:26:44,273 --> 00:26:45,675
The high salt content

00:26:45,675 --> 00:26:47,476
would explain why
my extraction failed.

00:26:47,476 --> 00:26:50,579
Only one vendor sells a version
with the precise

00:26:50,579 --> 00:26:52,281
mineral proportions
that I've identified,

00:26:52,281 --> 00:26:53,983
and they only
offer it online.

00:26:53,983 --> 00:26:57,653
I'm waiting for a list of
local customers as we speak.

00:26:59,722 --> 00:27:03,492
We found a shovel this morning,

00:27:03,492 --> 00:27:06,062
out in the desert.

00:27:06,062 --> 00:27:09,565
It had lotion on the handle,
a very specific lotion.

00:27:09,565 --> 00:27:13,402
You know the stuff I'm talking
about, don't you, Karen?

00:27:13,402 --> 00:27:15,071
Huh?

00:27:15,071 --> 00:27:16,505
You were out there.

00:27:16,505 --> 00:27:18,274
I think you went out there

00:27:18,274 --> 00:27:20,443
and dug up Scotty Gates' grave
to get to that treasure.

00:27:20,443 --> 00:27:22,011
Wait, what do you mean,
Scotty's grave?

00:27:23,379 --> 00:27:26,048
We were just looking
for the statue.

00:27:26,048 --> 00:27:27,316
We?

00:27:27,316 --> 00:27:29,285
Who'd you go out there with,
Karen?

00:27:30,653 --> 00:27:32,188
Roger.
Roger?

00:27:32,188 --> 00:27:34,323
Roger Mathers?

00:27:34,323 --> 00:27:37,460
How'd you end up out
in the desert with him?

00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,661
I caught Roger
breaking into

00:27:38,661 --> 00:27:40,463
my father's workshop
two nights ago.

00:27:40,463 --> 00:27:42,431
He was desperate to get
his hands on some photographs.

00:27:42,431 --> 00:27:44,066
Your dad's aerial photos.

00:27:44,066 --> 00:27:46,335
Well, why didn't you
just call the cops?

00:27:46,335 --> 00:27:48,604
I was about to,
but then Roger started

00:27:48,604 --> 00:27:50,106
talking about the treasure.

00:27:50,106 --> 00:27:52,641
The stone lion,
you know?

00:27:52,641 --> 00:27:54,477
He said it wasn't just lore,

00:27:54,477 --> 00:27:57,713
that it was really
worth something.

00:27:57,713 --> 00:28:00,382
He thought that with my dad's
photos, he could find it.

00:28:00,382 --> 00:28:02,618
And he offered to cut you
in on the deal.

00:28:02,618 --> 00:28:05,087
That's why you
decided to help him, hmm?

00:28:05,087 --> 00:28:07,256
I figured, why not?

00:28:07,256 --> 00:28:09,492
If anybody deserves
a piece of that treasure,

00:28:09,492 --> 00:28:11,093
it's me and my father.

00:28:11,093 --> 00:28:14,263
That case
ruined our lives.

00:28:14,263 --> 00:28:17,099
So the two of you went out
there to dig it up, huh?

00:28:17,099 --> 00:28:18,100
That was the plan.

00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,102
But it didn't happen.

00:28:20,102 --> 00:28:22,071
<i>We were able to find the spot,</i>

00:28:22,071 --> 00:28:23,239
<i>pretty much,</i>
<i>using the aerial photo.</i>

00:28:23,239 --> 00:28:25,708
It's got to be close.

00:28:25,708 --> 00:28:28,544
These look like the pipes
that are in the picture.

00:28:32,214 --> 00:28:34,083
No. No, no.

00:28:34,083 --> 00:28:35,985
No!

00:28:35,985 --> 00:28:37,553
Somebody beat us to it.

00:28:37,553 --> 00:28:39,021
I need the money.

00:28:39,021 --> 00:28:40,656
God, I need the statue!

00:28:40,656 --> 00:28:42,525
Hey...
No!

00:28:42,525 --> 00:28:43,659
Just get away from me.

00:28:43,659 --> 00:28:45,161
Go!

00:28:45,161 --> 00:28:46,462
KAREN:
<i>I walked away.</i>

00:28:46,462 --> 00:28:48,264
<i>That was the last time</i>
<i>I saw him--</i>

00:28:48,264 --> 00:28:50,199
<i>on his knees, crying.</i>

00:28:50,199 --> 00:28:53,736
I've known Roger
since we were kids.

00:28:53,736 --> 00:28:57,473
I would never hurt him.

00:28:59,708 --> 00:29:01,644
(drill whirring)

00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:14,323
Come here to tell me
you talked to Karen?

00:29:14,323 --> 00:29:16,592
Your daughter was the one who
raided your old case files, Sam.

00:29:18,527 --> 00:29:21,297
She gave the aerial photos
to Roger Mathers.

00:29:21,297 --> 00:29:22,631
I can't say
I'm surprised.

00:29:22,631 --> 00:29:24,500
Her whole life,
she had to put up with

00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,302
my obsession
with the case.

00:29:26,302 --> 00:29:27,670
Makes sense she'd feel entitled.

00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:29,305
RUSSELL:
Evidentially, she and Roger

00:29:29,305 --> 00:29:32,208
went out to the desert
and they were digging around.

00:29:32,208 --> 00:29:33,642
They didn't find anything.

00:29:35,444 --> 00:29:37,613
But looks like you did.

00:29:37,613 --> 00:29:40,282
(chuckles)

00:29:40,282 --> 00:29:43,152
The real stone lion is
almost 2,000 years old.

00:29:43,152 --> 00:29:44,954
This one isn't
even finished yet.

00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:49,592
Cement?

00:29:49,592 --> 00:29:51,627
Exact size and weight
as the original.

00:29:51,627 --> 00:29:53,329
It's a perfect copy
of the murder weapon.

00:29:53,329 --> 00:29:55,231
Come here, I want to show you
something. Look at this.

00:29:57,533 --> 00:30:00,402
This is a mock-up of the boy's
skull, complete with injuries.

00:30:00,402 --> 00:30:02,004
So what's your plan?

00:30:02,004 --> 00:30:04,039
Well, I am going
to re-enact the murder,

00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:06,175
try and duplicate the blow
that killed Scotty,

00:30:06,175 --> 00:30:07,509
prove it's consistent
with a killer

00:30:07,509 --> 00:30:09,245
the same size and frame
as Sheriff Combs.

00:30:09,245 --> 00:30:11,113
You really think he did it?

00:30:11,113 --> 00:30:13,682
Well, that's what
I want to find out.

00:30:15,417 --> 00:30:17,186
Not a bad idea.

00:30:17,186 --> 00:30:19,955
Is that your way of telling me
it's a good idea?

00:30:19,955 --> 00:30:21,457
Yeah. Yeah, it is.
(chuckles)

00:30:21,457 --> 00:30:23,392
I do think my
guys could, uh,

00:30:23,392 --> 00:30:24,960
offer a few improvements,

00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,629
if you don't mind
joining forces.

00:30:32,434 --> 00:30:35,104
So this is
just like yours,

00:30:35,104 --> 00:30:37,339
only we took it
a little bit further.

00:30:37,339 --> 00:30:39,108
(chuckles)
Just a little bit.

00:30:39,108 --> 00:30:41,610
Well, it's for practical reasons
more than anything else.

00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:43,479
If you were to do
the experiment,

00:30:43,479 --> 00:30:45,681
you'd probably have to destroy
about a dozen skulls.

00:30:45,681 --> 00:30:47,216
SANDERS:
But our head here

00:30:47,216 --> 00:30:49,218
can sustain
numerous blows,

00:30:49,218 --> 00:30:51,954
and the resulting trauma will be
simulated by that computer.

00:30:51,954 --> 00:30:53,355
BISHOP:
And I assume that,

00:30:53,355 --> 00:30:55,224
since we know
the extent of the trauma,

00:30:55,224 --> 00:30:56,592
you can set a target zone

00:30:56,592 --> 00:30:59,161
for the exact force
and angle of the impact.

00:30:59,161 --> 00:31:01,263
Yes, And that computer
will let us know

00:31:01,263 --> 00:31:02,598
when we perfectly
re-create the blow

00:31:02,598 --> 00:31:03,632
that killed Scotty Gates.

00:31:03,632 --> 00:31:05,467
Very cool.

00:31:06,735 --> 00:31:08,604
What are we waiting for?

00:31:08,604 --> 00:31:16,512
♪ ♪

00:31:36,198 --> 00:31:37,633
(computer beeping)

00:31:40,035 --> 00:31:41,437
The injuries
just aren't consistent

00:31:41,437 --> 00:31:43,238
with the sheriff's
height and build.

00:31:43,238 --> 00:31:45,574
There's no way the sheriff
could've killed Scotty.

00:31:45,574 --> 00:31:48,243
Well, according to this,
the killer was smaller,

00:31:48,243 --> 00:31:50,446
barely five-feet tall
and left-handed.

00:31:52,548 --> 00:31:55,684
Back when I was a deputy, I used
to coach some youth baseball.

00:31:55,684 --> 00:31:58,120
There was this one kid,

00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,155
a pitcher,

00:32:00,155 --> 00:32:01,690
<i>a mean southpaw.</i>

00:32:04,426 --> 00:32:06,161
Mr. Briggs?

00:32:06,161 --> 00:32:08,230
Think we need to
have another talk.

00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:10,265
I already told you everything
I know about Roger.

00:32:10,265 --> 00:32:11,700
Yeah, but now
you're gonna tell me

00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,336
everything you know
about Scotty Gates.

00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:16,538
That's where the killing
all started 25 years ago.

00:32:23,245 --> 00:32:24,446
ROGER:
<i>Please, mister, don't shoot us.</i>

00:32:24,446 --> 00:32:25,447
We won't tell anyone.

00:32:25,447 --> 00:32:26,982
(gunshot)

00:32:26,982 --> 00:32:29,084
(boys panting)

00:32:29,084 --> 00:32:31,286
I think he's dead.

00:32:31,286 --> 00:32:33,222
That's what you said before.

00:32:35,157 --> 00:32:36,291
Come on, grab the bags.

00:32:36,291 --> 00:32:37,659
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

00:32:37,659 --> 00:32:39,661
What are you doing?
We-we can't.

00:32:39,661 --> 00:32:42,631
He's dead.
He's not gonna use it.

00:32:42,631 --> 00:32:44,700
Yeah, but it's not ours.
We have to call the police.

00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,001
We're not
calling anybody.

00:32:46,001 --> 00:32:48,170
Now, shut up and
grab the bags!

00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:49,271
No.

00:32:49,271 --> 00:32:51,240
No, this is stupid.
We can't!

00:32:52,641 --> 00:32:54,710
(groans)
Don't be a baby!

00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:57,379
This is our hideout, and
whatever's in it is ours.

00:32:57,379 --> 00:32:58,347
Now shut up...

00:33:00,049 --> 00:33:01,250
And grab the bags.

00:33:03,118 --> 00:33:04,520
Idiot, you didn't have
to break my glasses.

00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,522
My dad's gonna kill me!

00:33:06,522 --> 00:33:08,490
Here, now you can
buy new glasses.

00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:09,992
Quit it, Roger.
It's not our money.

00:33:09,992 --> 00:33:11,427
The cops aren't
gonna let us keep it.

00:33:11,427 --> 00:33:12,661
We're not telling
the cops, stupid.

00:33:12,661 --> 00:33:13,962
We're not telling anybody.

00:33:13,962 --> 00:33:15,064
I told you.

00:33:15,064 --> 00:33:16,331
We have to.
God, Scotty.

00:33:16,331 --> 00:33:18,467
Stop being such a wuss!

00:33:18,467 --> 00:33:20,469
I'm not being a wuss.
I'm being smart.

00:33:20,469 --> 00:33:22,371
I'm being... normal.

00:33:22,371 --> 00:33:24,573
There's a dead guy
back there.

00:33:24,573 --> 00:33:27,176
I'm going home,
and I'm calling the cops!

00:33:27,176 --> 00:33:28,210
Scotty, I'm warning you.

00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:29,378
Screw you.

00:33:29,378 --> 00:33:31,146
You're not the boss
of me.

00:33:34,016 --> 00:33:36,952
I didn't mean to hurt him.

00:33:36,952 --> 00:33:37,953
I just...

00:33:40,089 --> 00:33:42,691
I just...

00:33:42,691 --> 00:33:45,394
I just snapped.

00:33:45,394 --> 00:33:48,130
Yeah, just those...
those bags of cash--

00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:51,166
it just seemed like
all the money in the world.

00:33:53,235 --> 00:33:55,537
I just didn't want
nobody to take it.

00:33:55,537 --> 00:33:57,473
So you killed your best friend.

00:33:57,473 --> 00:34:00,375
No. I didn't kill him.

00:34:00,375 --> 00:34:03,946
I mean, I hit him.

00:34:03,946 --> 00:34:05,347
But he wasn't dead.

00:34:05,347 --> 00:34:06,982
Oh, come on, Tyson.

00:34:06,982 --> 00:34:08,951
He had a fractured skull.

00:34:08,951 --> 00:34:10,319
Stop playing
these games with me.

00:34:10,319 --> 00:34:11,720
Tell me what happened out there.

00:34:13,455 --> 00:34:16,091
Somebody... somebody else
was out there that day.

00:34:17,526 --> 00:34:18,994
We didn't know
we'd been followed.

00:34:18,994 --> 00:34:20,028
GIRL:
<i>Hey, guys!</i>

00:34:20,028 --> 00:34:21,163
(groans)

00:34:21,163 --> 00:34:22,431
You guys better
shut him up.

00:34:22,431 --> 00:34:24,032
Someone's coming.

00:34:24,032 --> 00:34:26,034
Damn it, Karen. Why do you
always have to follow us?

00:34:26,034 --> 00:34:28,504
Didn't you hear what I said?
There's a car coming.

00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:39,281
(groaning)

00:34:39,281 --> 00:34:41,416
Shh.

00:34:44,419 --> 00:34:47,156
(muffled groaning)

00:34:47,156 --> 00:34:48,657
Damn it!

00:34:57,032 --> 00:34:57,966
No!

00:35:08,977 --> 00:35:12,114
STOKES:
<i>So you smothered him?</i>

00:35:12,114 --> 00:35:14,950
Look, I felt bad.

00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:19,521
But in the moment,
it was him or all of us.

00:35:21,456 --> 00:35:23,559
So the three of you
buried Scotty

00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:26,295
out in the desert
along with that statue?

00:35:26,295 --> 00:35:28,297
We were worried
someone would find him.

00:35:28,297 --> 00:35:30,532
But right away,
the focus shifted to Lake Mead,

00:35:30,532 --> 00:35:32,467
so no one ever did.

00:35:32,467 --> 00:35:34,469
What happened to all
that money? The cash?

00:35:34,469 --> 00:35:36,738
We hid it under the porch
at Roger's house.

00:35:36,738 --> 00:35:38,674
Couple of months later,
his grandmother fell asleep

00:35:38,674 --> 00:35:40,943
on the couch
with a cigarette in her hand.

00:35:40,943 --> 00:35:42,377
Burned the house to the ground.

00:35:42,377 --> 00:35:45,047
So Scotty died
for nothing.

00:35:45,047 --> 00:35:46,949
We were just kids.

00:35:46,949 --> 00:35:48,584
Stupid kids.

00:35:48,584 --> 00:35:52,321
Yeah, well, you're not
a kid anymore, Karen.

00:35:52,321 --> 00:35:54,723
Know what you are?

00:35:54,723 --> 00:35:56,491
You're a liar.

00:35:56,491 --> 00:35:59,394
I think you lied to us the
last time you came in here.

00:35:59,394 --> 00:36:01,697
I think that you and Roger
found that stone lion

00:36:01,697 --> 00:36:03,398
the other night, the two of you.

00:36:03,398 --> 00:36:05,634
You know what else
I think?

00:36:05,634 --> 00:36:08,403
I think when you got
to the cars...

00:36:10,572 --> 00:36:12,441
Something went wrong.

00:36:12,441 --> 00:36:15,377
That wasn't the deal, Roger.
You said we'd split it 50/50.

00:36:15,377 --> 00:36:17,713
I said we'd split it;
I didn't say how.

00:36:17,713 --> 00:36:19,348
You didn't even know
the statue was worth anything

00:36:19,348 --> 00:36:20,716
until I told you.

00:36:20,716 --> 00:36:22,117
And you never
would've found it

00:36:22,117 --> 00:36:24,386
without my
father's photos.

00:36:24,386 --> 00:36:26,688
I'll cut you in
for a finder's fee.

00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:30,158
Come on, Karen.

00:36:30,158 --> 00:36:31,126
What are you gonna do?

00:36:32,661 --> 00:36:34,229
You gonna kill me

00:36:34,229 --> 00:36:35,697
like you killed Scotty?

00:36:40,168 --> 00:36:42,537
Not a bad theory.

00:36:42,537 --> 00:36:47,476
Problem is,
you don't have any evidence.

00:36:47,476 --> 00:36:52,214
My father always taught me:
no evidence, no case.

00:36:52,214 --> 00:36:53,615
FINLAY:
<i>There is no way</i>

00:36:53,615 --> 00:36:56,018
that we can get her
for Scotty Gates' murder.

00:36:56,018 --> 00:36:57,486
She was 11 at the time,

00:36:57,486 --> 00:36:59,655
and we can't even conclude
a cause of death.

00:36:59,655 --> 00:37:01,657
We have to get her for
killing Roger Mathers.

00:37:01,657 --> 00:37:03,392
I know, but we don't
have the evidence.

00:37:03,392 --> 00:37:04,626
And by the time we do,

00:37:04,626 --> 00:37:07,029
she will have covered
her tracks.

00:37:07,029 --> 00:37:09,665
Sam?
You looking for me?

00:37:13,735 --> 00:37:15,604
When Karen was a teenager,

00:37:15,604 --> 00:37:18,106
she used to go down to
the creek bed behind our house.

00:37:18,106 --> 00:37:20,509
She had this little hiding place
down there where she'd

00:37:20,509 --> 00:37:24,413
stash her cigarettes,
thinking I-I didn't know.

00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:28,483
I took a look
down there tonight.

00:37:33,422 --> 00:37:36,058
If this is what
I think it is,

00:37:36,058 --> 00:37:39,961
your daughter can go
to prison for a long time.

00:37:50,138 --> 00:37:51,406
FINLAY:
Nine millimeter.

00:37:51,406 --> 00:37:53,275
Same caliber
that killed Roger Mathers.

00:37:53,275 --> 00:37:56,945
All for this.

00:37:56,945 --> 00:37:58,547
BISHOP: You know,
for years, I wondered

00:37:58,547 --> 00:38:01,149
if that thing really existed.

00:38:01,149 --> 00:38:04,052
Now, more than ever,
I wish it hadn't.

00:38:06,621 --> 00:38:09,257
I thought I knew
my little girl.

00:38:09,257 --> 00:38:10,726
I thought we had no secrets.

00:38:12,627 --> 00:38:15,464
For 25 years, she'd been
hiding the truth from me.

00:38:18,166 --> 00:38:20,035
I don't understand it.

00:38:20,035 --> 00:38:21,470
I just...

00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:23,972
I'm sorry. I really am.

00:38:23,972 --> 00:38:25,640
You do everything
you can for your kid.

00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:28,410
You-you give them everything.

00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:31,046
Everything.

00:38:31,046 --> 00:38:34,416
Including the power
to break your heart.

00:38:47,195 --> 00:38:49,398
Captain, you wanted
to know if there was news.

00:38:49,398 --> 00:38:51,066
Yeah.

00:38:51,066 --> 00:38:53,001
The swelling in Ellie's brain
has subsided enough

00:38:53,001 --> 00:38:55,003
that we've reduced
the medication.

00:38:55,003 --> 00:38:56,238
She is responsive now.

00:38:56,238 --> 00:38:57,939
She's awake?
Yes.

00:38:57,939 --> 00:38:59,307
But still in recovery.

00:38:59,307 --> 00:39:01,443
I understand.
Thank you, Doctor.

00:39:13,021 --> 00:39:14,656
They told me you were hovering.

00:39:14,656 --> 00:39:16,258
Yeah.

00:39:16,258 --> 00:39:19,628
I just want to, uh, make
sure that you were...

00:39:19,628 --> 00:39:20,629
All right?

00:39:22,531 --> 00:39:25,300
We both know that
that's not really possible.

00:39:27,369 --> 00:39:30,071
Why'd you even come?

00:39:30,071 --> 00:39:32,107
I guess I'm...

00:39:32,107 --> 00:39:35,010
just not ready to...

00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:36,545
give up on you, Ellie.

00:39:39,614 --> 00:39:42,951
This is not your fault.

00:39:42,951 --> 00:39:45,987
There's always been
something wrong with me.

00:39:45,987 --> 00:39:48,290
No, that-that's not true.

00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:51,593
You should just let me go.

00:39:51,593 --> 00:39:53,995
I've tried.

00:39:53,995 --> 00:39:55,230
Believe me.

00:39:56,698 --> 00:40:00,669
But I can't.

00:40:00,669 --> 00:40:02,471
I mean...

00:40:02,471 --> 00:40:03,572
you're all I have left.

00:40:07,108 --> 00:40:09,211
Look, I'm going to, uh...

00:40:09,211 --> 00:40:11,713
I'm gonna let you rest,
let you sleep, okay?

00:40:16,251 --> 00:40:18,186
No. Stay.

00:40:20,722 --> 00:40:22,657
Please, Dad?

00:40:29,197 --> 00:40:30,298
Hey, Jim.

00:40:30,298 --> 00:40:31,733
Hmm.

00:40:31,733 --> 00:40:33,502
D.B., come in. Sit down.

00:40:39,074 --> 00:40:41,309
I hear Ellie's
out of the woods.

00:40:41,309 --> 00:40:43,044
Yeah.

00:40:43,044 --> 00:40:45,380
Two of you able to talk?

00:40:47,015 --> 00:40:48,450
Yeah, we did.

00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:50,652
For a while.

00:40:50,652 --> 00:40:51,953
You all right?

00:40:51,953 --> 00:40:53,021
I am, actually.

00:40:53,021 --> 00:40:54,689
Can I buy you a drink?

00:40:54,689 --> 00:40:56,191
Yeah.

00:41:01,096 --> 00:41:03,298
Here you go.

00:41:03,298 --> 00:41:04,332
Happy days.

00:41:04,332 --> 00:41:06,501
Happy day.

00:41:06,501 --> 00:41:10,205
You're a little calmer
than I thought you might be.

00:41:10,205 --> 00:41:11,673
You sure you're all right?

00:41:11,673 --> 00:41:14,509
Yeah, I just had
a four-hour conversation

00:41:14,509 --> 00:41:16,378
with my daughter.

00:41:16,378 --> 00:41:19,080
That's something that hasn't
happened to me in 15 years.

00:41:20,715 --> 00:41:22,684
We realize
that we need each other.

00:41:22,684 --> 00:41:24,252
Even more now.

00:41:27,522 --> 00:41:29,324
I-I would be a little...

00:41:29,324 --> 00:41:31,560
little bit cautious
if I were you.

00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,228
Cautious?
What do you mean?

00:41:33,228 --> 00:41:35,530
You think she's trying
to manipulate me-- is that it?

00:41:37,332 --> 00:41:39,701
I love her, D.B.

00:41:39,701 --> 00:41:41,102
I have to trust her.

00:41:41,102 --> 00:41:44,005
She's all I got.

00:41:44,005 --> 00:41:47,208
And I want to be there for her,
I mean, really be there,

00:41:47,208 --> 00:41:50,545
help her out,
the way any father would.

00:41:50,545 --> 00:41:52,180
Good for you.

00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:54,482
And I hope it works out.
I really do.

00:41:54,482 --> 00:41:56,651
Well, you and me both.

00:41:56,651 --> 00:41:58,420
And with a little luck,
who knows?

00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:00,255
Okay.

00:42:00,255 --> 00:42:02,357
I think I'm gonna
hit the road.

00:42:02,357 --> 00:42:04,025
Okay.

00:42:04,025 --> 00:42:06,027
Yeah.

00:42:09,164 --> 00:42:10,632
Want to walk out with me?

00:42:10,632 --> 00:42:13,501
No, I think I'm gonna
hang out here for a while.

00:42:13,501 --> 00:42:16,137
I got to figure some things out.

00:42:16,137 --> 00:42:18,006
Okay.
