00:00:02,742 --> 00:00:05,311
(music plays in distance)

00:00:05,311 --> 00:00:07,246
(static crackling over
indistinct voices)

00:00:11,684 --> 00:00:15,588
(indistinct chatter;
static crackling)

00:00:15,588 --> 00:00:17,090
MAN (staticky): Can I get a cup
of coffee from...

00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:18,925
(man continues, voice garbled,
mixed with other voices)

00:00:18,925 --> 00:00:20,159
WOMAN: Where do you want
to go tonight?

00:00:20,159 --> 00:00:22,028
(staticky):
You want, to, like...

00:00:22,028 --> 00:00:24,063
MAN: I'd like a tall latte
with, uh, two shots... (static)

00:00:25,398 --> 00:00:26,966
Coming right up.
Thanks.

00:00:28,968 --> 00:00:30,169
Would you like anything
to eat, sir?

00:00:30,169 --> 00:00:32,005
No, thank you.

00:00:32,005 --> 00:00:34,974
That'll be three
dollars, please.

00:00:34,974 --> 00:00:37,610
Um, look, I don't suppose you
could, uh, break a 50?

00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:39,679
For a three-dollar latte?

00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:41,381
Well, it's all I have.

00:00:41,381 --> 00:00:43,416
All right.
(clears throat)

00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:44,651
Thank you;
thank you so much.

00:00:49,422 --> 00:00:52,158
Mr. Merchiston?

00:00:52,158 --> 00:00:54,661
Keep walking.

00:00:55,795 --> 00:00:56,863
Who are you?

00:00:56,863 --> 00:00:58,765
A friend of Suvari.

00:00:58,765 --> 00:00:59,899
Where is Suvari?

00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:01,434
Not here, but I am.

00:01:01,434 --> 00:01:03,536
Right. And what
assurance do I have

00:01:03,536 --> 00:01:06,472
that this man Suvari
is actually real?

00:01:06,472 --> 00:01:10,076
How does Suvari really know
that you're a reporter?

00:01:10,076 --> 00:01:12,912
And not an Agency asset?

00:01:12,912 --> 00:01:14,414
Well, in the interest
of full disclosure,

00:01:14,414 --> 00:01:16,149
I've yet to be mistaken
for James Bond.

00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:18,017
(laughs)

00:01:18,017 --> 00:01:19,586
Aw.

00:01:21,154 --> 00:01:22,755
(surveillance camera whirring)

00:01:24,123 --> 00:01:25,858
Suvari will be in touch.

00:01:45,878 --> 00:01:48,147
(alarm chirps)

00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:52,485

00:01:55,822 --> 00:01:58,558
(engine roars, tires screech)

00:02:03,529 --> 00:02:05,398
(engine roars)

00:02:05,398 --> 00:02:07,166
(siren starts up,
tires screech)

00:02:08,935 --> 00:02:10,870
OFFICER (over radio):
Control, this is 3-David-34.

00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,505
Reporting a possible 425-Baker.

00:02:12,505 --> 00:02:14,073
In pursuit of a silver Camaro.

00:02:14,073 --> 00:02:16,676
License Adam-King-Sam-Henry,
413.

00:02:16,676 --> 00:02:19,479
Vehicle's traveling southbound
on Rialto Ridge

00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:20,480
at high rate of speed.

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,615
(siren wailing)

00:02:22,615 --> 00:02:24,117
Backup units, be advised.

00:02:24,117 --> 00:02:25,852
Suspect vehicle has turned
onto Wilmington.

00:02:25,852 --> 00:02:26,953
(tires screech, siren wails)

00:02:32,859 --> 00:02:34,727
He's heading for the Strip.

00:02:34,727 --> 00:02:37,463
OFFICER:
Control, this guy's not
stopping.

00:02:37,463 --> 00:02:39,766
We need to bring him down
before he hurts somebody.

00:02:42,869 --> 00:02:44,937
OFFICER:
He's crossing lanes!

00:02:46,005 --> 00:02:47,573
Oh, my God!

00:02:47,573 --> 00:02:50,543
CONTROL:
All units, fire and paramedics

00:02:50,543 --> 00:02:52,512
are en route to your location.

00:02:53,746 --> 00:02:55,615
Thank you.

00:02:55,615 --> 00:02:57,617
Yeager?!
What are you doing here?

00:02:57,617 --> 00:02:59,385
Oh, I'm pulling
double shifts this week.

00:02:59,385 --> 00:03:01,387
Need the hours,
so you're stuck with me.

00:03:01,387 --> 00:03:03,823
So, our driver raced
through the intersection,

00:03:03,823 --> 00:03:06,592
lost control,
hit this lamp pole,

00:03:06,592 --> 00:03:08,161
and spun out over there.

00:03:08,161 --> 00:03:09,962
The vehicle's registered
to Zenith Car Rentals.

00:03:09,962 --> 00:03:11,497
Office will be
open in a hour.

00:03:11,497 --> 00:03:12,732
We'll get
the renter's name then.

00:03:12,732 --> 00:03:14,167
Think I have an I.D.

00:03:17,503 --> 00:03:19,439
Passport.

00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:24,777
Finn...
check this out.

00:03:35,922 --> 00:03:37,657
It's John Merchiston.

00:03:37,657 --> 00:03:39,492
The reporter?

00:03:39,492 --> 00:03:40,760
Yeah.

00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,628
I don't understand.

00:03:42,628 --> 00:03:44,397
Why would he run from the LVPD?

00:03:44,397 --> 00:03:45,998
I don't know.
It doesn't make any sense.

00:03:45,998 --> 00:03:47,500
Well, if this guy's a reporter,

00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,135

The day that it does go quiet.

00:04:56,035 --> 00:04:57,069
Do you think that that

00:04:57,069 --> 00:04:58,871
that will bring you peace?

00:04:58,871 --> 00:05:00,840
<i>Or will it be a loss</i>
<i>too great to bear?</i>

00:05:04,443 --> 00:05:07,580
Merchiston and I spent
a lot of time together.

00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,649
I suppose he got
to know me a little bit.

00:05:09,649 --> 00:05:11,984
But I don't, I don't know
anything about him.

00:05:11,984 --> 00:05:13,586
I don't know
if he had a family...

00:05:13,586 --> 00:05:14,954
He doesn't have any family.

00:05:17,123 --> 00:05:19,759
Well, hell.

00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,594
All right.

00:05:21,594 --> 00:05:22,862
What do we know?

00:05:22,862 --> 00:05:25,431
On the face of it,
it looks like an accident.

00:05:25,431 --> 00:05:27,600
What's that supposed to mean--
"on the face of it"?

00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,701
Well, look at the vehicle.

00:05:28,701 --> 00:05:30,069
There's nothing left of it.

00:05:30,069 --> 00:05:32,471
I mean, the engine is
all the way over there.

00:05:32,471 --> 00:05:34,874
Have you ever seen
a car accident like this?

00:05:34,874 --> 00:05:36,442
Yeah, sadly, I have.

00:05:36,442 --> 00:05:38,110
Alcohol, drugs, a lead foot.

00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,712
I see it all the time.

00:05:39,712 --> 00:05:41,113
Yeah, well, John didn't drink

00:05:41,113 --> 00:05:42,615
and he didn't do drugs.

00:05:42,615 --> 00:05:44,617
He had been sober
for over two years.

00:05:44,617 --> 00:05:47,787
Is there something
you should be telling me?

00:05:47,787 --> 00:05:50,489
John was working on a story.

00:05:50,489 --> 00:05:52,491
Something to do
with the government

00:05:52,491 --> 00:05:54,093
and domestic spying.

00:05:54,093 --> 00:05:55,795
He told me
that he was being followed.

00:05:55,795 --> 00:05:57,630
I, of course, thought
that he was paranoid.

00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:00,132
Wait, wait a minute.

00:06:00,132 --> 00:06:01,100
When did this happen?

00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,435
Well, a couple of months ago.

00:06:02,435 --> 00:06:03,769
I-I had, uh, you know...

00:06:03,769 --> 00:06:04,904
We stayed in touch.

00:06:04,904 --> 00:06:07,506
You'd stayed in touch.

00:06:07,506 --> 00:06:09,709
Yes, we stayed in touch.

00:06:09,709 --> 00:06:11,077
I'm listening.

00:06:11,077 --> 00:06:13,779
The extent
of the damage to the car,

00:06:13,779 --> 00:06:16,749
the behavior of a man who had no
reason to run from the police,

00:06:16,749 --> 00:06:20,486
and yet, was obviously running
from something.

00:06:20,486 --> 00:06:21,654
So you think this was murder?

00:06:21,654 --> 00:06:23,890
That John was targeted?

00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:26,058
I think he was being silenced
for something that he knew.

00:06:26,058 --> 00:06:28,394
Somebody puts a bomb
in the car?

00:06:28,394 --> 00:06:30,930
Detonates it during a
high-speed police chase?

00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,798
Is that what you think?
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

00:06:32,798 --> 00:06:34,033
That's way out there, Jules.

00:06:34,033 --> 00:06:35,468
You don't believe

00:06:35,468 --> 00:06:36,769
that there are
parts of government

00:06:36,769 --> 00:06:38,604
that would go
to extreme measures

00:06:38,604 --> 00:06:40,406
to silence someone?

00:06:40,406 --> 00:06:41,908
What I believe in is evidence.

00:06:41,908 --> 00:06:43,743
And so should you
if you're thinking

00:06:43,743 --> 00:06:46,145
about accusing
somebody in authority.

00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,649
BRODY:
Based on this video footage,

00:06:49,649 --> 00:06:51,517
I can't tell
if Finn's theory is correct,

00:06:51,517 --> 00:06:53,152
and the car exploded
before hitting the light pole.

00:06:53,152 --> 00:06:55,888
Or if it happened on impact.

00:06:55,888 --> 00:06:58,925
Here's the rest of the traffic
cam footage from the chase.

00:06:58,925 --> 00:07:00,760
Merchiston ran the red light

00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,429
at Sahara and Rialto Ridge
already doing 90.

00:07:03,429 --> 00:07:05,131
Let's see where
This chase began.

00:07:05,131 --> 00:07:07,833
(beeping)

00:07:09,535 --> 00:07:11,437
Garage at the
Embarcadero?

00:07:11,437 --> 00:07:13,172
Man, he came flying
out of there.
Hmm.

00:07:13,172 --> 00:07:15,808
And that is

00:07:15,808 --> 00:07:18,110
the best angle from the street
of the Embarcadero we have.

00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:20,680
We might be able to track him
moving through the mall.

00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,648
Let's see.

00:07:22,648 --> 00:07:25,017
Hello.

00:07:25,017 --> 00:07:26,385
Who's the mystery woman?

00:07:26,385 --> 00:07:27,787
I don't know.

00:07:27,787 --> 00:07:29,655
But it looks like
she handed him something.

00:07:29,655 --> 00:07:30,690
And the way the
light's hitting it,

00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:31,958
it looks metallic.

00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:33,426
Maybe a key?

00:07:33,426 --> 00:07:34,827
Merchiston was
a journalist.

00:07:34,827 --> 00:07:37,430
I'm thinking
that that was a flash drive.

00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,665
We didn't find a flash drive
at the scene.

00:07:39,665 --> 00:07:41,834
Though I doubt it would have
survived that explosion.

00:07:41,834 --> 00:07:44,403
BRODY: You know, she was
the last person to see

00:07:44,403 --> 00:07:46,172
Merchiston alive.
We need to find her.

00:07:46,172 --> 00:07:47,840
WOMAN:
<i>So, Mr. Merchiston,</i>

00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,844
you go from rock journalist
to quixotic muckraker.

00:07:51,844 --> 00:07:54,580
I'd have to say
I'm just a seeker of the truth.

00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,716
And if that makes
certain people uncomfortable,

00:07:56,716 --> 00:07:58,584
then maybe they need
to be uncomfortable.

00:07:58,584 --> 00:07:59,819
'Cause I would say that

00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:02,989
in our obsession with security,

00:08:02,989 --> 00:08:05,658
we may be relinquishing
our freedom.

00:08:05,658 --> 00:08:08,995
Surrendering
to the real enemy-- fear.

00:08:08,995 --> 00:08:11,998
Finished my autopsy
on Mr. Merchiston.

00:08:11,998 --> 00:08:15,735
"C.O.D.: massive
blunt force trauma

00:08:15,735 --> 00:08:17,703
consistent with
high speed impact."

00:08:17,703 --> 00:08:20,873
If it's any consolation, death
would've been mercifully quick--

00:08:20,873 --> 00:08:23,109
long before
the fire consumed the vehicle.

00:08:23,109 --> 00:08:25,544
Tox report shows
high levels of cocaine,

00:08:25,544 --> 00:08:28,014
and a blood alcohol level
of .19.

00:08:28,014 --> 00:08:30,149
And in that condition,
I'm not surprised

00:08:30,149 --> 00:08:31,984
he didn't want
to get pulled over.

00:08:31,984 --> 00:08:34,487
It says here you're going
to rule it an accident.

00:08:34,487 --> 00:08:37,890
He should never
have been behind the wheel.

00:08:45,131 --> 00:08:47,166

Yeah, something

At first, I thought
this was some kind

00:09:15,661 --> 00:09:16,929
of triggering device.

00:09:16,929 --> 00:09:19,532

It was installed after-market
by the rental car company.

00:09:21,734 --> 00:09:24,670

00:09:26,605 --> 00:09:28,541
All right, so, it's
not part of a bomb,

00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:30,409
but it is a black box,

00:09:30,409 --> 00:09:32,111
so, maybe
there's some information in it

00:09:32,111 --> 00:09:35,081
that would suggest
that there was a bomb.

00:09:35,081 --> 00:09:38,517
Possible. Here is the file
of the car's last trip.

00:09:38,517 --> 00:09:41,087
Merchiston floored it
down Rialto Ridge.

00:09:41,087 --> 00:09:44,423
He made a left turn,
then crashed.

00:09:44,423 --> 00:09:46,759
These vitals and
the GPS indicate

00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:48,794
a single catastrophic event

00:09:48,794 --> 00:09:51,764
occurring at the coordinates
where the car hit the pole.

00:09:51,764 --> 00:09:55,968
So, your explosion
happened upon contact.

00:09:55,968 --> 00:09:57,703
Well, that doesn't
rule out a bomb.

00:09:57,703 --> 00:09:59,138
Well, it doesn't
support it, either.

00:09:59,138 --> 00:10:00,506
This might.

00:10:00,506 --> 00:10:01,874
I found unusually
high levels

00:10:01,874 --> 00:10:03,075
of aluminum, magnesium,

00:10:03,075 --> 00:10:04,944
silicon and iron oxide
in the wreckage.

00:10:04,944 --> 00:10:09,048
All are consistent with
a thermite explosion.

00:10:09,048 --> 00:10:11,083
Well, that would explain
the intensity of the blast

00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,518
that we saw on the tape.

00:10:12,518 --> 00:10:13,786
And the condition
of the vehicle.

00:10:13,786 --> 00:10:16,689
But... we are talking
about a car exploding

00:10:16,689 --> 00:10:18,390
upon impact with a light pole.

00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,559
And the metals present in

00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:22,928
thermite are also found
in laptops,

00:10:22,928 --> 00:10:24,563
cell phones, tablets.

00:10:24,563 --> 00:10:26,765
I know that you're looking
for a different answer,

00:10:26,765 --> 00:10:29,935
but I think that we need to find
something more definitive.

00:10:29,935 --> 00:10:32,605
(phone rings)

00:10:32,605 --> 00:10:34,740
John's attorney is here,

00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,976
and she wants us
to release his body.

00:10:38,077 --> 00:10:39,445
I don't understand.

00:10:39,445 --> 00:10:40,846
I thought the circumstances

00:10:40,846 --> 00:10:42,414
of John's accident
were pretty clear-cut.

00:10:42,414 --> 00:10:45,651
Well, we still have a...
few questions,

00:10:45,651 --> 00:10:47,987
Ms. McDermott, and we thought
maybe you could, uh...

00:10:47,987 --> 00:10:49,855
you could help us.

00:10:49,855 --> 00:10:51,757
Questions like what?

00:10:51,757 --> 00:10:55,594
Uh, like, what was the story
that John was working on

00:10:55,594 --> 00:10:58,130
which brought him here to Vegas
in the last few months?

00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:00,599
John.

00:11:00,599 --> 00:11:02,635
So it's you.

00:11:02,635 --> 00:11:04,003
(exhales)

00:11:04,003 --> 00:11:06,939
John always had
a weakness for blondes.

00:11:08,107 --> 00:11:10,476
Your client is dead.

00:11:10,476 --> 00:11:14,013
Any information you have
might help us close this case.

00:11:14,013 --> 00:11:15,614
So do me a favor,
will you?

00:11:15,614 --> 00:11:17,583
Do you, do you recognize
this woman?

00:11:19,752 --> 00:11:20,953
No. Why?

00:11:20,953 --> 00:11:22,154
FINLAY:
She was the last person

00:11:22,154 --> 00:11:23,756
to see John alive.

00:11:23,756 --> 00:11:26,559
We think that she
passed him some information.

00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:28,027
I've never seen her before.

00:11:28,027 --> 00:11:30,429
All I know is
John was working

00:11:30,429 --> 00:11:31,764
on an investigative piece.

00:11:31,764 --> 00:11:33,132
Something to do with
computer hacking

00:11:33,132 --> 00:11:35,501
and domestic
intelligence gathering.

00:11:35,501 --> 00:11:37,603
So, spying on U.S. citizens.

00:11:37,603 --> 00:11:39,638
McDERMOTT:
Allegedly.

00:11:39,638 --> 00:11:42,107
The point person
is an Air Force general,

00:11:42,107 --> 00:11:44,143
Robert Lansdale,
out of Nellis.

00:11:44,143 --> 00:11:45,945
Nellis.

00:11:45,945 --> 00:11:47,012
That would help explain

00:11:47,012 --> 00:11:48,447
all the trips to Vegas.

00:11:48,447 --> 00:11:49,648
Yeah, and why his accident

00:11:49,648 --> 00:11:51,150
may not have been an accident.

00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:55,921
I know John had a gift
for telling a good tale.

00:11:55,921 --> 00:11:57,856
Seducing his listener.

00:11:57,856 --> 00:12:01,627
But the truth is,
his story was going nowhere.

00:12:01,627 --> 00:12:03,028
He was frustrated.

00:12:03,028 --> 00:12:04,930
So you think
it <i>was</i> an accident?

00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:06,799
I do.
Well, you must
have known

00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:08,601
that he had enemies.
Yes.

00:12:08,601 --> 00:12:10,169
But, also, <i>you</i> must know

00:12:10,169 --> 00:12:13,839
that John's own worst enemy
was always himself.

00:12:17,142 --> 00:12:18,711
Yeager, it's Russell.
Where are we

00:12:18,711 --> 00:12:21,046
on the security footage
from the Embarcadero?

00:12:22,648 --> 00:12:24,016
Well-Well then,
go to another judge.

00:12:24,016 --> 00:12:25,117
We need those tapes.

00:12:25,117 --> 00:12:27,486
I want eyes on Merchiston

00:12:27,486 --> 00:12:30,689
and this mystery woman,
wherever they went, okay?

00:12:30,689 --> 00:12:32,691
Call me back.

00:12:35,628 --> 00:12:36,729
(car engine starts)

00:12:42,668 --> 00:12:43,936
(grunts)

00:12:43,936 --> 00:12:45,738
Oh!

00:12:47,573 --> 00:12:48,974
John?

00:12:50,609 --> 00:12:52,144
What the hell are you doing?
We thought you were

00:12:52,144 --> 00:12:53,812
...dead.
Dead.

00:12:53,812 --> 00:12:55,881
Yeah, I know.

00:12:55,881 --> 00:12:57,950
We don't have much time.
I can't stay here.

00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,585
Where's your car?

00:12:59,585 --> 00:13:01,887
Where is your car?
We need to get out of here, now.

00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,095
What the hell is
going on, John?
I wish I knew.

00:13:10,095 --> 00:13:13,499
I wish I bloody knew.
You know a lot more than I do.
Start... Come here.

00:13:13,499 --> 00:13:14,833
Whose body is in our morgue?

00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,168
Oh, it's Brian.

00:13:16,168 --> 00:13:18,604
Brian Freeman,
he's my assistant.

00:13:18,604 --> 00:13:19,905
He was driving my car.

00:13:21,607 --> 00:13:22,875
I gave him my coat and my hat.

00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:24,710
He took his place
behind the wheel of my car

00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:26,412
and I slipped out the back,

00:13:26,412 --> 00:13:27,846
and we both know
what happened after that.
No, no.

00:13:27,846 --> 00:13:29,615
We identified the body using
your dental records.

00:13:29,615 --> 00:13:31,083
How is that possible?

00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:33,585
Same way you got a tox report
claiming that I was high.

00:13:33,585 --> 00:13:34,987
And drunk.
Don't play games with me!

00:13:34,987 --> 00:13:37,122
Talk to me!
I'm not playing games with you!

00:13:37,122 --> 00:13:38,924
(whispers):
I'm covering a story.

00:13:38,924 --> 00:13:41,460
I know.
About domestic spying, right?

00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,162
So you know
it's of a sensitive nature,

00:13:43,162 --> 00:13:45,531
involving powerful people.

00:13:45,531 --> 00:13:47,900
People capable of hacking
into a crime lab computer,

00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,569
fabricating
a toxicology report

00:13:50,569 --> 00:13:51,970
labeling me
a drunk driver.

00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:53,972
What about the dental records?

00:13:53,972 --> 00:13:56,709
Well, they've got their hackers,
and I've got mine.

00:13:56,709 --> 00:13:58,777
I-I need your help, DB.

00:13:58,777 --> 00:14:01,413
John, I'm just
a local cop.

00:14:01,413 --> 00:14:02,548
If what you're
saying is true,

00:14:02,548 --> 00:14:04,016
you need to...

00:14:04,016 --> 00:14:06,151
you need to talk to a
friend of mine at the FBI.

00:14:06,151 --> 00:14:08,487
FBI? You're joking, are you?

00:14:08,487 --> 00:14:10,689
That's the last place
I'm going is the FBI.

00:14:12,758 --> 00:14:14,159
You are hardly a local cop.

00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:17,162
In fact,
you and your team--

00:14:17,162 --> 00:14:19,531
you're literally
the only ones who can help me.

00:14:22,101 --> 00:14:24,636
Please, DB.

00:14:24,636 --> 00:14:26,105
My life's in your hands.

00:14:26,105 --> 00:14:28,040
The people who are trying
to kill me, the people who...

00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,875
killed Brian.

00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:32,111
When they find out
their mistake...

00:14:32,111 --> 00:14:33,946
they <i>will</i> try again.

00:14:33,946 --> 00:14:36,081
I just need to lay low
for a while.

00:14:36,081 --> 00:14:38,751
Until I can figure out
what the hell's on this.

00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:44,390
I heard you got your hands
on the security cam footage

00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:45,758
from the Embarcadero mall.

00:14:45,758 --> 00:14:47,126
Yeah, yeah, I'm going
through it right now.

00:14:47,126 --> 00:14:49,695
Well, how the hell
did you pull that off?

00:14:49,695 --> 00:14:51,063
'Cause I've been on the
phone for three hours

00:14:51,063 --> 00:14:52,731
with four different judges,

00:14:52,731 --> 00:14:54,166
and I couldn't even
get close to a warrant.

00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:56,001
Yeager, sometimes you
have to know who to ask

00:14:56,001 --> 00:14:57,403
and how to ask.

00:14:57,403 --> 00:14:59,905
There was a very lovely,
nice young woman

00:14:59,905 --> 00:15:01,673
working at
Embarcadero operations

00:15:01,673 --> 00:15:05,411
who was more than happy
to give me a hand.

00:15:05,411 --> 00:15:06,412
Well, I'm impressed.

00:15:06,412 --> 00:15:07,413
Thank you.
Yeah.

00:15:07,413 --> 00:15:10,015
Here she makes
the drop-off,

00:15:10,015 --> 00:15:11,784
and then she just kind of
heads off through the crowd.

00:15:11,784 --> 00:15:13,419
What's behind
the corner, there?

00:15:16,054 --> 00:15:18,924
Look at the reflection.

00:15:18,924 --> 00:15:21,059
Let's see if I can
get a taxi number.

00:15:22,127 --> 00:15:23,562
I'm impressed again.

00:15:23,562 --> 00:15:26,832
"T312X."

00:15:26,832 --> 00:15:29,601
Call the company, see where
the cabbie dropped her off.

00:15:32,404 --> 00:15:33,505
<i>(knocking on door)</i>

00:15:35,874 --> 00:15:36,975
I can't believe it.

00:15:39,378 --> 00:15:41,613
I'm sorry,
I-I had nowhere else to go.

00:15:41,613 --> 00:15:42,948
All right, come on in.

00:15:45,384 --> 00:15:47,052
Let's start at the beginning,

00:15:47,052 --> 00:15:49,521
with, uh, the flash
drive and the woman

00:15:49,521 --> 00:15:52,090
who gave it to you.
Like I told you, I'm working
on a story right now.

00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:54,092
Uh, I have an inside man.

00:15:54,092 --> 00:15:56,562
He's providing
me with information
on Project Jericho,

00:15:56,562 --> 00:15:58,497
which is a domestic
spying program.

00:15:58,497 --> 00:16:00,999
And he goes by
the name of Suvari.

00:16:00,999 --> 00:16:04,570
So the woman was your contact?
I don't know who the woman is.
I've never met her before.

00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:07,940
You see, in the past, Suvari
just arranged a dead drop.

00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:10,075
He'd leave a flash drive
somewhere and I'd find it.

00:16:10,075 --> 00:16:11,877
But not this time.
No, no.

00:16:11,877 --> 00:16:14,413
This time I told him I actually
need to look him in the eye.

00:16:14,413 --> 00:16:16,582
Before I publish my story,
I need to be assured

00:16:16,582 --> 00:16:17,816
that the information
that he's providing

00:16:17,816 --> 00:16:19,751
on Project Jericho is genuine.

00:16:19,751 --> 00:16:22,054
Specifically, about the man
who's-who's running things.

00:16:22,054 --> 00:16:23,589
Who's some Air Force general.

00:16:23,589 --> 00:16:26,492
Robert Lansdale.

00:16:26,492 --> 00:16:28,560
How did you...?
Oh, that's all
right, go on.

00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,662
Right. Well, amongst
other things right now,

00:16:30,662 --> 00:16:33,131
they're using drones
for domestic surveillance.

00:16:33,131 --> 00:16:34,967
Question is:
who are they watching?

00:16:34,967 --> 00:16:36,401
And who's watching the watchmen?

00:16:36,401 --> 00:16:38,937
Precisely. Um...

00:16:38,937 --> 00:16:42,841
I was told that the information
off this flash drive would make

00:16:42,841 --> 00:16:44,710
Snowden's leaks look like
a minor blip on the radar.

00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:47,412
I'm assuming that
the files are encrypted.

00:16:47,412 --> 00:16:50,749
I had the decryption key
on my laptop.

00:16:50,749 --> 00:16:51,884
That was in my car.

00:16:51,884 --> 00:16:53,118
Which is where we come in.

00:16:53,118 --> 00:16:55,621
Assuming that you
can crack it.

00:16:55,621 --> 00:16:57,556
The safest place
for you right now

00:16:57,556 --> 00:16:59,024
is to stay here.
First, we need

00:16:59,024 --> 00:17:00,759
to find out what's
on this flash drive.

00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:02,861
Then we can figure out
what our next move is.

00:17:02,861 --> 00:17:04,730
Where are you going?

00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:06,498
I'm gonna go
back to the lab.
The three of us

00:17:06,498 --> 00:17:08,500
are the only people that know
that John's still alive.

00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,868
Let-Let's keep it that way.

00:17:09,868 --> 00:17:12,004
I'll call you when
I get something.

00:17:13,805 --> 00:17:16,975
(thunder rumbling)

00:17:16,975 --> 00:17:19,578
YEAGER: <i>The cab company</i>
<i>said our mystery woman</i>

00:17:19,578 --> 00:17:22,814
was dropped off at the
Palermo last night at 11:15.

00:17:22,814 --> 00:17:25,851
Hotel has her registered
under the name Emily Rey.

00:17:25,851 --> 00:17:28,120
Security checked her room,
she wasn't there.

00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:31,823
An hour ago, we get
a call out here-- 419.

00:17:33,659 --> 00:17:35,727
She fits the description.

00:17:35,727 --> 00:17:37,796
Super Dave, what's the word?

00:17:37,796 --> 00:17:40,499
TOD's approximately
six hours ago.

00:17:40,499 --> 00:17:44,603
And we got blunt force trauma
to the back of the head.

00:17:44,603 --> 00:17:45,871
STOKES:
Yeah.

00:17:47,406 --> 00:17:48,941
All this spatter,

00:17:48,941 --> 00:17:51,443
cast-off, I'd be willing
to bet you she was hit

00:17:51,443 --> 00:17:52,878
more than a couple
of times, yeah?

00:17:52,878 --> 00:17:54,513
Definitely.

00:17:54,513 --> 00:17:56,048
YEAGER: Hey, we got
more blood over here.

00:17:56,048 --> 00:17:59,918
Gravitational drops...

00:17:59,918 --> 00:18:02,020
could've come
off the weapon.

00:18:04,056 --> 00:18:05,857
Nick...

00:18:07,392 --> 00:18:08,627
(thunder rumbling)

00:18:10,762 --> 00:18:12,431
STOKES: Oh, yeah.

00:18:12,431 --> 00:18:15,701
Got a print and blood.
And a good one, at that.

00:18:15,701 --> 00:18:16,969
Just sent the photo to the lab,

00:18:16,969 --> 00:18:18,403
they're running
a check.

00:18:18,403 --> 00:18:20,472
(phone chimes)

00:18:20,472 --> 00:18:21,673
Just got a hit.

00:18:21,673 --> 00:18:22,874
That was quick.

00:18:22,874 --> 00:18:24,076
What the hell?

00:18:24,076 --> 00:18:25,477
What's wrong?

00:18:25,477 --> 00:18:26,979
Hey, Dave.
Yeah.

00:18:26,979 --> 00:18:29,414
You say the time of death
was six hours ago, right?

00:18:29,414 --> 00:18:30,582
That's right. Why?

00:18:32,918 --> 00:18:34,786
Our killer's a dead man.

00:18:39,091 --> 00:18:40,525
Greg...

00:18:40,525 --> 00:18:41,893
I got something
I need you to do.

00:18:41,893 --> 00:18:43,428
Well, I'm kind of
in the middle of something.

00:18:43,428 --> 00:18:44,830
Well, this takes priority.

00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,031
A flash drive?
(cell phone chimes)

00:18:46,031 --> 00:18:47,766
Files on it are encrypted.

00:18:47,766 --> 00:18:49,501
I need you to open
them up for me.

00:18:49,501 --> 00:18:51,570
Oh, damn it.

00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:52,604
Is everything all right?

00:18:52,604 --> 00:18:54,039
Just-Just do it.

00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,842
STOKES:
<i>DB...</i>

00:18:56,842 --> 00:18:58,977
We got a problem. I need to talk
to you about that Merchiston

00:18:58,977 --> 00:19:02,514
car wreck.
All right, come in,
come in.

00:19:02,514 --> 00:19:06,118
Well, there's something
just not right about it.

00:19:06,118 --> 00:19:07,786
(sighs)

00:19:09,454 --> 00:19:11,156
Tell me what you know.
Yeager and I tracked down

00:19:11,156 --> 00:19:14,126
the mystery woman, the one
that met Merchiston in the mall.

00:19:14,126 --> 00:19:16,528
I'm pretty sure those two
hooked up again later.

00:19:16,528 --> 00:19:17,663
Why do you say that?

00:19:17,663 --> 00:19:19,498
'Cause she's dead.

00:19:19,498 --> 00:19:22,167
Beaten to death with a crowbar,
and Merchiston's fingerprints

00:19:22,167 --> 00:19:23,935
right there
on the murder weapon.

00:19:23,935 --> 00:19:26,505
Now, she was killed
six hours ago.

00:19:26,505 --> 00:19:28,473
His car crash was 36 hours ago.

00:19:28,473 --> 00:19:29,975
I mean, you do the math.

00:19:29,975 --> 00:19:32,577
Are you absolutely positive
about the fingerprint?

00:19:32,577 --> 00:19:34,112
It's in the victim's blood.

00:19:34,112 --> 00:19:36,114
Listen, Merchiston
is still alive,

00:19:36,114 --> 00:19:38,417
and he's a stone-cold killer.

00:19:39,885 --> 00:19:41,153
What's going on?

00:19:41,153 --> 00:19:43,088
(phone buzzing, shower running)

00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:01,039
(gasps)

00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,474
(sighs)

00:20:02,474 --> 00:20:04,076
You scared me.

00:20:04,076 --> 00:20:06,144
That wasn't my intention.

00:20:06,144 --> 00:20:09,748
John, I-I...

00:20:09,748 --> 00:20:11,950
Something happened

00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:13,685
since the last time

00:20:13,685 --> 00:20:15,053
I saw you.

00:20:15,053 --> 00:20:16,488
What?

00:20:16,488 --> 00:20:19,024
I don't want to
talk about it.

00:20:30,802 --> 00:20:32,404
Russell left me a message.

00:20:32,404 --> 00:20:33,505
Really? What about?

00:20:33,505 --> 00:20:34,740
I'm checking.

00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:46,585
What's the matter?

00:20:49,421 --> 00:20:50,922
Why are you looking
at me like that?

00:20:53,058 --> 00:20:54,693
FBI! Drop the gun.

00:20:55,794 --> 00:20:59,164
CSI Finlay,
gun on the floor.

00:20:59,164 --> 00:21:00,599
Now!

00:21:03,168 --> 00:21:04,636
Give me the gun, Julie.

00:21:06,705 --> 00:21:09,541
We have to take you in.
Both of you.

00:21:23,889 --> 00:21:27,526
(laptop blipping rapidly
as it downloads)

00:21:27,526 --> 00:21:28,460
(blipping stops)

00:21:36,501 --> 00:21:37,636
CSI Russell.

00:21:37,636 --> 00:21:40,705
Special Agent
Sturgis, FBI.

00:21:40,705 --> 00:21:42,440
I'm going to need to
read you your rights.

00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,409
That's all right...

00:21:44,409 --> 00:21:46,144
I think I know them.

00:21:55,053 --> 00:21:56,588
CSI Russell.

00:21:56,588 --> 00:21:58,423
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:21:58,423 --> 00:22:00,792
Well, it's a long trip
from Nellis.

00:22:00,792 --> 00:22:02,394
General Lansdale,
right?

00:22:02,394 --> 00:22:04,429
No uniform--

00:22:04,429 --> 00:22:06,565
I'm guessing this
conversation's
off the record.

00:22:08,867 --> 00:22:10,402
John Merchiston...

00:22:10,402 --> 00:22:13,004
man's a murderer.

00:22:13,004 --> 00:22:16,942
But worse than that,
he's a threat to this country.

00:22:16,942 --> 00:22:18,977
Can you prove either one
of those allegations?

00:22:18,977 --> 00:22:20,612
FBI will.

00:22:20,612 --> 00:22:21,880
At this moment,
they're securing

00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,548
all the evidence
from your lab.

00:22:23,548 --> 00:22:25,984
You need to know that my people
had no knowledge of this

00:22:25,984 --> 00:22:28,453
whatsoever.
Does that include CSI Finlay?

00:22:29,554 --> 00:22:31,089
Despite your
best efforts

00:22:31,089 --> 00:22:33,825
to alert her, she and
Mr. Merchiston are in custody.

00:22:35,627 --> 00:22:37,495
I know...

00:22:37,495 --> 00:22:40,031
that you have a relationship
with John Merchiston.

00:22:40,031 --> 00:22:42,901
Maybe you trust him--
but you shouldn't.

00:22:42,901 --> 00:22:47,706
I'm not sure who I should be
trusting right now, General.

00:22:47,706 --> 00:22:50,475
Well, you certainly
come by <i>that</i> honestly.

00:22:50,475 --> 00:22:52,611
I know about
your parents.

00:22:52,611 --> 00:22:55,947
About their activities
during the '60s.

00:22:55,947 --> 00:22:59,751
But you, you...
you became a cop.

00:22:59,751 --> 00:23:02,821
That says a lot about you,
about them.

00:23:02,821 --> 00:23:06,057
Must feel sort of odd sitting
on that side of the table.

00:23:06,057 --> 00:23:08,793
What do you want?

00:23:08,793 --> 00:23:11,596
I want to know
what Merchiston told you

00:23:11,596 --> 00:23:13,064
about a gentleman named Suvari.

00:23:13,064 --> 00:23:14,866
He didn't tell
me anything.

00:23:14,866 --> 00:23:18,169
I'm here as a courtesy,
Mr. Russell.

00:23:18,169 --> 00:23:21,072
The FBI can continue
this conversation.

00:23:21,072 --> 00:23:23,708
(clears throat softly)
What about my lab?

00:23:23,708 --> 00:23:27,379
I don't think it'll look
very good for either
one of us, General,

00:23:27,379 --> 00:23:30,782
if the wheels of justice
grind to a halt.

00:23:34,386 --> 00:23:35,720
I'll give you
an opportunity

00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,555
to make arrangements
with your team.

00:23:39,457 --> 00:23:41,660
You're a lucky man.

00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,561
You got a family,

00:23:43,561 --> 00:23:45,697
good job,

00:23:45,697 --> 00:23:47,565
so much to live for.

00:23:47,565 --> 00:23:49,834
You should know
from personal experience

00:23:49,834 --> 00:23:52,604
the cost of misplaced loyalty.

00:24:13,959 --> 00:24:16,494
STURGIS:
We believe your friend
John Merchiston

00:24:16,494 --> 00:24:18,563
has been receiving leaks
of classified information

00:24:18,563 --> 00:24:20,565
vital to our
nation's security.

00:24:20,565 --> 00:24:22,100
Leaks from
an inside source,

00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:25,003
goes by the name Suvari.

00:24:25,003 --> 00:24:26,638
I don't know what
you're talking about.
Yeah?

00:24:26,638 --> 00:24:28,173
Obviously, you
know one thing--

00:24:28,173 --> 00:24:30,041
Merchiston faked
his own death.

00:24:30,041 --> 00:24:32,143
When he realized
we were closing in on him,

00:24:32,143 --> 00:24:34,112
he set up his assistant.

00:24:34,112 --> 00:24:35,613
Murdered him.

00:24:35,613 --> 00:24:37,983
Then he murdered this woman,
Emily Rey,

00:24:37,983 --> 00:24:40,719
the only other person who could
connect him to this Suvari.

00:24:40,719 --> 00:24:42,687
Looks like you got it
all figured out.

00:24:42,687 --> 00:24:43,955
Why do you need me?

00:24:43,955 --> 00:24:45,991
Well, maybe this Emily Rey

00:24:45,991 --> 00:24:48,793
isn't the only connection
to Suvari.

00:24:48,793 --> 00:24:52,731
Well, if that's the case,
why didn't John kill me?

00:24:52,731 --> 00:24:55,400
I like to think
we saved your life.

00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,801
Now it's your turn--

00:24:56,801 --> 00:24:59,838
to help save the lives
of perhaps thousands, if these

00:24:59,838 --> 00:25:01,940
security leaks
are allowed to go unchecked.

00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,708
I don't buy it.

00:25:03,708 --> 00:25:05,610
(scoffs)

00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:09,814
That's... not the cooperative
attitude I was looking for.

00:25:09,814 --> 00:25:12,417
I don't know if you're
protecting Merchiston

00:25:12,417 --> 00:25:14,953
because you've fallen for him
or his politics,

00:25:14,953 --> 00:25:17,489
or maybe he's just a great lay.

00:25:17,489 --> 00:25:19,157
Honestly, I don't care.
Whatever pillow talk

00:25:19,157 --> 00:25:21,459
you two shared,
you are gonna give it up.

00:25:21,459 --> 00:25:24,629
At the risk of sounding
like your British boy toy...

00:25:24,629 --> 00:25:26,031
we could go all night.

00:25:26,031 --> 00:25:27,499
You know what, Agent?

00:25:27,499 --> 00:25:28,867
Go screw yourself!

00:25:28,867 --> 00:25:30,435
That's what you wanted
to say, right?

00:25:30,435 --> 00:25:32,037
BRASS:
Finlay, I advise you

00:25:32,037 --> 00:25:33,705
not to say another word.

00:25:33,705 --> 00:25:35,573
You're here
as an observer, Captain.

00:25:35,573 --> 00:25:37,142
This is my house;
these are my people.

00:25:37,142 --> 00:25:38,777
And if you don't
start acting nice,

00:25:38,777 --> 00:25:40,445
I'm gonna kick your FBI
ass right out of here.

00:25:48,586 --> 00:25:50,055
Russell. Russell.

00:25:50,055 --> 00:25:52,457
Hey, I got your message.
Looks like Finn

00:25:52,457 --> 00:25:54,692
and I are gonna be here
for a little while.

00:25:54,692 --> 00:25:57,028
Merchiston's being charged
with willful communication

00:25:57,028 --> 00:25:59,497
of national defense
information.

00:25:59,497 --> 00:26:01,399
And murder.

00:26:01,399 --> 00:26:03,468
He's letting his lawyer
do the talking right now.

00:26:03,468 --> 00:26:05,036
According to them,
we harbored

00:26:05,036 --> 00:26:07,439
someone who stole secrets,
faked his own death,

00:26:07,439 --> 00:26:08,907
and then murdered
two people.

00:26:08,907 --> 00:26:10,575
Unless we can prove

00:26:10,575 --> 00:26:13,778
that someone was setting
Merchiston up the whole time.

00:26:13,778 --> 00:26:16,648
I mean, we have
his bloody fingerprint
on the murder weapon--

00:26:16,648 --> 00:26:19,484
that makes for a pretty
good argument.
I know, but...

00:26:19,484 --> 00:26:23,054
he once did a forensic field
training with Scotland Yard.

00:26:23,054 --> 00:26:24,789
So he's not stupid enough

00:26:24,789 --> 00:26:28,126
to leave his bloody
fingerprint behind.

00:26:28,126 --> 00:26:30,829
Look, you're the
boss now, bud.

00:26:30,829 --> 00:26:33,565
Get us out of here,
will you?

00:26:46,811 --> 00:26:49,747
♪ ♪

00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,082
FBI yanked all the files
on the Merchiston case,

00:27:24,082 --> 00:27:25,984
but I still had a photo
of the bloody fingerprint

00:27:25,984 --> 00:27:27,652
in my phone.
Check it out.

or what you don't see.

00:27:29,521 --> 00:27:32,457
BRODY:
Ridge detail's all there.

00:27:32,457 --> 00:27:34,659
But there are no pores.

00:27:34,659 --> 00:27:36,661
How is that even possible?

00:27:36,661 --> 00:27:39,464
We've seen this before,
haven't we, Greg?

00:27:39,464 --> 00:27:40,565
The Millander case.

00:27:40,565 --> 00:27:41,566
Mm-hmm.

00:27:41,566 --> 00:27:42,901
A serial killer made

00:27:42,901 --> 00:27:45,870
a mold of Grissom's
print in latex,

00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:47,472
planted it at
a crime scene.

00:27:47,472 --> 00:27:49,707
But unlike skin,
latex gives you

00:27:49,707 --> 00:27:51,709
ridge detail but no pores.

00:27:51,709 --> 00:27:53,645
Russell was right--
this whole thing's a setup,

00:27:53,645 --> 00:27:56,481
from the Emily Rey murder
to the car crash-- all of it.

00:27:56,481 --> 00:27:58,116
Sounds pretty sophisticated.

00:27:58,116 --> 00:28:00,485
Do we think
the FBI's involved?

00:28:00,485 --> 00:28:02,687
STOKES:
No... no, I think they're
just doing their job.

00:28:02,687 --> 00:28:04,856
Well, then
who is it?
I don't know.

00:28:04,856 --> 00:28:06,891
But I don't even know
where to start looking

00:28:06,891 --> 00:28:08,026

00:28:08,026 --> 00:28:10,695
with everything.

00:28:10,695 --> 00:28:12,564
Maybe not everything.

00:28:14,132 --> 00:28:16,000
Russell gave this to me
right after Merchiston

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,769
came back from the dead.

00:28:17,769 --> 00:28:20,438
The guy's accused of stealing
classified information--

00:28:20,438 --> 00:28:23,174
it might be on there.
It might also show

00:28:23,174 --> 00:28:24,876
who's trying
to set Merchiston up.

00:28:24,876 --> 00:28:26,844
Even help spring
Russell and Finn.

00:28:26,844 --> 00:28:29,147
BRODY:
With all these eyes on us,

00:28:29,147 --> 00:28:31,583
it's gonna be almost impossible
to do the job.

00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:34,385
All eyes are on <i>us,</i>

00:28:34,385 --> 00:28:36,521
but I can think
of somebody who

00:28:36,521 --> 00:28:39,123
might be able to fly
under the radar.

00:28:44,529 --> 00:28:46,064
Hey, Nick.

00:28:46,064 --> 00:28:47,532
Hey.
This was left

00:28:47,532 --> 00:28:48,933
at Reception.
What is it?

00:28:48,933 --> 00:28:51,035
Nevada Wireless--
looks like a new phone.

00:28:51,035 --> 00:28:52,837
I didn't order a phone.

00:29:07,051 --> 00:29:10,488
(music playing in distance)

00:29:13,925 --> 00:29:15,493
Hi.
Hi.

00:29:15,493 --> 00:29:17,695
I'll have a cup
of coffee, please.

00:29:17,695 --> 00:29:19,564
Sure. What flavor?

00:29:19,564 --> 00:29:21,099
Coffee-flavored.

00:29:21,099 --> 00:29:24,836
BARISTA:
That'll be $1.35, sir.

00:29:24,836 --> 00:29:26,070
Keep it.

00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:27,605
Thank you.

00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:40,818
You're Suvari?

00:29:40,818 --> 00:29:43,688
I'm not, but...
he reached out to me,

00:29:43,688 --> 00:29:46,824
(over radio):
said he could help my client
and your CSI friends.

00:29:46,824 --> 00:29:48,493
Okay. Where is he?

00:29:48,493 --> 00:29:49,727
I'm supposed to take you to him.

00:29:57,869 --> 00:30:01,639
So, you, uh, decrypted the files
on the flash drive I gave you?

00:30:01,639 --> 00:30:03,408
Files are classified

00:30:03,408 --> 00:30:06,544
Department of Defense documents
relating to Project Jericho:

00:30:06,544 --> 00:30:08,713
the use of drones
to listen in on
communications.

00:30:08,713 --> 00:30:11,416
Now, this is all in
the development stages,

00:30:11,416 --> 00:30:14,118
<i>but</i> definitely something DoD
would not want to go public.

00:30:14,118 --> 00:30:15,887
All right,
but is it serious enough

00:30:15,887 --> 00:30:18,423
that someone from the government
would be willing to stage

00:30:18,423 --> 00:30:21,392
a fake car crash,
murder a woman, just to...

00:30:21,392 --> 00:30:23,528
keep it a secret?
Just because
you're not paranoid

00:30:23,528 --> 00:30:24,896
doesn't mean
they're not following you.

00:30:24,896 --> 00:30:26,864
In this case, backseat driving.

00:30:26,864 --> 00:30:29,133
What do you mean?

00:30:29,133 --> 00:30:30,468
One of the files
references--

00:30:30,468 --> 00:30:31,969
(footsteps approaching)

00:30:34,906 --> 00:30:36,708
One of the files refers

00:30:36,708 --> 00:30:38,743
to Wi-Fi technology,
which enables a user

00:30:38,743 --> 00:30:41,612
to hack a car's onboard CPUs--

00:30:41,612 --> 00:30:43,881
specifically, after-market
black boxes,

00:30:43,881 --> 00:30:45,883
like the one that was installed

00:30:45,883 --> 00:30:48,653
in Merchiston's
rental car.
So you're saying that

00:30:48,653 --> 00:30:51,622
they've developed a software
that allows you

00:30:51,622 --> 00:30:54,425
to take control of a car...
remotely.

00:30:54,425 --> 00:30:56,427
And remotely crash it.

00:30:56,427 --> 00:30:58,429
There's also references

00:30:58,429 --> 00:31:00,765
to enhancing the effects
of the accident

00:31:00,765 --> 00:31:03,101
with a thermite
cocktail-- ka-boom!

00:31:03,101 --> 00:31:04,869
All right, well,
that still doesn't mean

00:31:04,869 --> 00:31:07,171
that someone from the government
is behind all of this.

00:31:07,171 --> 00:31:10,608
For all we know,
it could be this guy Suvari.

00:31:19,851 --> 00:31:22,153
You're not gonna tell me
where we're going?

00:31:22,153 --> 00:31:24,922
You want to meet
Suvari or don't you?

00:31:24,922 --> 00:31:27,792
There's a rest stop
outside of Searchlight.

00:31:27,792 --> 00:31:29,794

I'd like to get there
in one piece.

00:31:39,737 --> 00:31:41,939
It's not me--
my foot's off the pedal.

00:31:41,939 --> 00:31:43,908
Turn off
the cruise control.

00:31:43,908 --> 00:31:45,943
No, it's not on.

00:31:48,513 --> 00:31:50,948
Try the brakes.
They're not working!

00:31:53,384 --> 00:31:55,586

stay cool, we got this.

headed off
by your friend Suvari.

Evidence-- proof of the attack

using a tactic called
"Boston Brakes."

00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,568
Boston Brakes?

00:34:57,568 --> 00:35:00,504
So-called because that was
the first place it was used.

to hack onboard
computers in cars,

00:35:15,152 --> 00:35:17,555
and I think that
Suvari wants us to know

00:35:17,555 --> 00:35:19,957
it's what happened to this

tumbling down.

00:35:39,577 --> 00:35:41,579
Clearly, he's suggesting
Lansdale's behind the murder

00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:44,715
of this woman
to cover up the affair.

00:35:44,715 --> 00:35:47,385
There's the chance
that the child found

is his son.

used it to override

car that we were in, but,

00:36:18,883 --> 00:36:21,886

Well, we-we found him.

00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:48,866
But then again,
I think you know that,

00:38:48,866 --> 00:38:51,435
because you found him first,
didn't you?

00:38:51,435 --> 00:38:53,103
His real name is Joseph Powers.

00:38:53,103 --> 00:38:55,673
Former Army Intelligence.

00:38:55,673 --> 00:38:58,809
More recently employed
by Ceressus Logistics.

00:38:58,809 --> 00:39:03,414
He was a-a contractor assigned
to Project Jericho, wasn't he?

00:39:03,414 --> 00:39:05,015
I don't recognize him.

00:39:05,015 --> 00:39:07,151
But then again, I have a lot
of people working under me.

00:39:07,151 --> 00:39:11,021
How about Cheryl Perez?

00:39:11,021 --> 00:39:13,023
You recognize her?

00:39:13,023 --> 00:39:14,859
I heard about her car accident.

00:39:14,859 --> 00:39:16,560
Tragic.

00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,962
Yes, it was.

00:39:17,962 --> 00:39:19,430
We were all deeply saddened.

00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:20,631
Especially,

00:39:20,631 --> 00:39:22,867
evidentially, Joseph Powers.

00:39:22,867 --> 00:39:26,604
I mean, he-he resigned
a week after the accident.

00:39:26,604 --> 00:39:29,707
He just fell right off the grid,
until, of course,

00:39:29,707 --> 00:39:31,976
he started reaching out
to John Merchiston.

00:39:31,976 --> 00:39:33,711
You remember John, don't you?

00:39:33,711 --> 00:39:35,846
Where's this going?

00:39:35,846 --> 00:39:39,116
Did Cheryl Perez threaten
to go to your wife or your boss?

00:39:39,116 --> 00:39:42,486
Or did she want money
to help support her child?

00:39:42,486 --> 00:39:43,654
Your child?

00:39:43,654 --> 00:39:46,056
A man with a good job

00:39:46,056 --> 00:39:49,894
and a family has so much
to live for, right?

00:39:49,894 --> 00:39:53,831
Or... kill for.

00:39:53,831 --> 00:39:55,666
I would be very careful
about what you say.

00:39:55,666 --> 00:39:59,770
Why? Am I about
to have a car accident?

00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:01,739
See, I know what you've done.
You've used

00:40:01,739 --> 00:40:04,508
the entire national security
apparatus,

00:40:04,508 --> 00:40:08,045
all of their technology,
to cover up an affair.

00:40:08,045 --> 00:40:09,980
You don't know what I've done.

00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:14,718
And even if you did,
you wouldn't understand.

00:40:14,718 --> 00:40:17,588
You're not a soldier, a patriot.

00:40:17,588 --> 00:40:20,991
You are just another
child of the '60s

00:40:20,991 --> 00:40:23,527
who cloaks himself in principle,

00:40:23,527 --> 00:40:26,964
while our enemies plot
to bring chaos to our streets.

00:40:26,964 --> 00:40:28,933
Well, I am not gonna
let that happen.

00:40:28,933 --> 00:40:33,037
And I will stop <i>anybody</i>
who gets in my way.

00:40:33,037 --> 00:40:36,974
You know, my-my hippie parents
might not have taught me a lot,

00:40:36,974 --> 00:40:39,076
but they did teach me
about patience.

00:40:39,076 --> 00:40:41,078
I may not be able

00:40:41,078 --> 00:40:42,746
to prove anything today,

00:40:42,746 --> 00:40:45,749
but you have involved way
too many people here, General.

00:40:45,749 --> 00:40:47,985
And someday, there's gonna be
another Joseph Powers,

00:40:47,985 --> 00:40:49,687
another person of conscience,

00:40:49,687 --> 00:40:52,656
and when they step up,
oh, I'm going to be right there,

00:40:52,656 --> 00:40:55,693
waiting patiently for you.

00:40:56,894 --> 00:40:58,829
You're dismissed, General.

00:41:02,566 --> 00:41:05,903
I thought your flight left
in the morning.

00:41:05,903 --> 00:41:07,438
So did I.

00:41:07,438 --> 00:41:09,606
The editor needs to
see me immediately.

00:41:09,606 --> 00:41:11,508
Mm.

00:41:13,644 --> 00:41:15,980
It's the truth.
I believe you.

00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:20,584
Russell is not giving up on
Lansdale, and neither am I.

00:41:20,584 --> 00:41:22,720
I'll be back.

00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,655
Good to know.

00:41:26,724 --> 00:41:29,927
Look, uh...

00:41:29,927 --> 00:41:33,564
that thing that, uh,

00:41:33,564 --> 00:41:35,566
you didn't want
to talk about--

00:41:35,566 --> 00:41:38,602
should you ever
change your mind,

00:41:38,602 --> 00:41:40,604
I'm an excellent listener.

00:41:42,906 --> 00:41:45,709
Thank you.
I appreciate that.

00:41:45,709 --> 00:41:47,878
Yeah.

00:41:47,878 --> 00:41:49,480
Be safe.

00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,415
Yeah. You, too.

00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:01,825
Be well.

00:42:01,825 --> 00:42:03,394
Yeah. You, too.
