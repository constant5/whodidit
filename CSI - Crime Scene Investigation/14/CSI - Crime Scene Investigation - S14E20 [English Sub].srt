Now you're saying
your attacker looked like me?

00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,692
But ten minutes ago,
you said,

00:00:51,692 --> 00:00:53,560
"I couldn't see him
'cause I was blindfolded."

00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,429
That is technically right,
but by the sound of his voice,

00:00:55,429 --> 00:00:57,931
I could... I could
totally picture him.

just like my colleague here,

00:01:03,804 --> 00:01:05,672
grabs you off the street...
Blindfolds you.

...blindfolds you,

00:01:06,673 --> 00:01:08,609
drives you to a dark room,

reeking of brimstone,

00:01:09,943 --> 00:01:12,513
cuts off a hunk of your leg,
and then...

00:01:12,513 --> 00:01:14,314
And he eats it!

00:01:22,823 --> 00:01:26,059
Now that I think about it...

00:01:26,059 --> 00:01:28,929
he sounded more like you.

00:01:28,929 --> 00:01:31,698
(distorted):
Absolutely delectable.

particular psychopath.

Owen, it's been fun,

00:01:57,558 --> 00:01:58,859
but that's the morgue calling.

00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:00,527
We got to go.

00:02:00,527 --> 00:02:03,096
We'll start a file
and we'll keep an eye out.

00:02:03,096 --> 00:02:05,098
Make sure you go see a doctor.

00:02:05,098 --> 00:02:06,333
Yeah, have him
check your head.

00:02:07,467 --> 00:02:09,036
Make sure
you get in bed.

00:02:09,036 --> 00:02:12,005
Right. Okay.
Yeah...

00:02:16,076 --> 00:02:18,912
Hey, man, sorry.
I heard you were looking for me.

00:02:18,912 --> 00:02:22,316
I had some lunatic at PD
talking about a people-eater.

00:02:22,316 --> 00:02:25,686
I heard about it,
and that's why I asked for you.

00:02:25,686 --> 00:02:30,457
That story might not
be so loony.

00:02:30,457 --> 00:02:31,925

called this in.

00:02:31,925 --> 00:02:33,594
Found it at
the garbage dump.

00:02:33,594 --> 00:02:37,798
These, uh, rectangular
wounds exhibit a serration

00:02:37,798 --> 00:02:39,733
of a steak knife.

00:02:39,733 --> 00:02:41,668
What are those particles
around the wound?

00:02:41,668 --> 00:02:43,971

00:02:47,507 --> 00:02:48,709
This is a prank, right?

00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:49,810
This is real.

00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:52,045
A-A crude
dismemberment like this

00:02:52,045 --> 00:02:55,382

that this meat is murder.

Look at this--
the wound on Mr. Linder's leg

00:04:28,775 --> 00:04:32,713
exhibits the same distinct
blade flaw as these wounds.

00:04:35,048 --> 00:04:38,318
So, same knife,
same assailant maybe.

So, no idea where he ran from?

00:04:59,539 --> 00:05:01,341
Mm-mm. By the time
the cops showed up,

00:05:01,341 --> 00:05:02,776
he was completely turned around.

00:05:02,776 --> 00:05:03,977
Okay, boys.

There's more to his story?

00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,442
A twisted prologue.

00:05:35,442 --> 00:05:37,844
Owen has been spending
some serious time

00:05:37,844 --> 00:05:40,313

of the Internet.

Short for vorarephilia--

00:05:44,718 --> 00:05:46,586
an erotic, compulsive fixation

00:05:46,586 --> 00:05:48,088
that involves eating

00:05:48,088 --> 00:05:50,991
or being eaten by
other living things.

00:05:50,991 --> 00:05:53,393

Well, that's just one room
in the Vore fetish madhouse.

00:05:56,329 --> 00:06:00,066
Others involve man-eating plants
and giant hungry cats

00:06:00,066 --> 00:06:02,002
and a whole pornucopia of things

00:06:02,002 --> 00:06:03,737
you don't even want
to know about.

00:06:03,737 --> 00:06:05,071
You're right there.

00:06:05,071 --> 00:06:06,873
But Owen here

00:06:06,873 --> 00:06:08,708
is into plain old cannibalism.

00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:10,310
At least the idea of it.

00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,078
I mean, he is all
over these sites.

00:06:12,078 --> 00:06:14,948

00:06:14,948 --> 00:06:17,551
Doing what other
Vore enthusiasts do:

00:06:17,551 --> 00:06:19,386
talking about his desire
to be devoured.

00:06:19,386 --> 00:06:20,687
Sharing his fantasies

00:06:20,687 --> 00:06:23,924
of having his flesh
chewed up and swallowed.

00:06:23,924 --> 00:06:28,395
Yeah, but his fantasy became
a... a bloody reality.

00:06:28,395 --> 00:06:31,765
So, what do you think,
that he asked for what happened?

00:06:31,765 --> 00:06:35,902
That he offered himself up
to a... a real-life cannibal?

00:06:35,902 --> 00:06:39,706
I think that Owen and I
need to chew the fat.

00:06:46,813 --> 00:06:49,416
Did I forget to mention
this part of the story?

00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:52,485
I could tell you guys barely
believed me about the attack,

00:06:52,485 --> 00:06:54,654
much less if it looked
like I asked for it.

00:06:54,654 --> 00:06:56,656
So you didn't ask for it?

00:06:56,656 --> 00:06:58,692
For a guy to help himself
to a hunk of my leg?

00:06:58,692 --> 00:07:00,026
Are you nuts?!

00:07:00,026 --> 00:07:01,528
It was supposed to be
role-playing.

00:07:01,528 --> 00:07:03,363
I thought I made that
very clear to him.

00:07:03,363 --> 00:07:04,764
Clear to who?

00:07:04,764 --> 00:07:06,366
Your attacker?

00:07:06,366 --> 00:07:08,535
Yeah.

00:07:08,535 --> 00:07:10,070
Who was he?
I don't know.

00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:12,939
Guy responded privately
to one of my Web posts.

00:07:12,939 --> 00:07:15,609
Said he was a "pred"
looking for "prey."

00:07:15,609 --> 00:07:16,977
Went by the name "Eater."

00:07:16,977 --> 00:07:18,578
Wanted to meet up.

00:07:18,578 --> 00:07:21,314
So you made a... date?

00:07:21,314 --> 00:07:23,650
Yeah. "Eater" told me, uh, to
wait in front of my house,

00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,018
and he sneaks up.

00:07:25,018 --> 00:07:26,786
(snaps fingers)
Blindfold.

00:07:26,786 --> 00:07:28,989
Puts me in the car,
takes me to his place.

00:07:28,989 --> 00:07:30,523
You went willingly?

00:07:30,523 --> 00:07:31,925
Oh, yeah.

00:07:31,925 --> 00:07:33,927
Yeah, but I figured,
you know, we'd...

00:07:33,927 --> 00:07:36,529
we'd get out the condiments,
you know, slather up and...

00:07:36,529 --> 00:07:37,731
All right. All right.

00:07:37,731 --> 00:07:39,499

00:07:39,499 --> 00:07:40,934
Right.

00:07:40,934 --> 00:07:42,469
So, after he cut you up...

00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:43,670
Yeah.

00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:44,938

00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:52,078
I swear.
All right.

00:07:52,078 --> 00:07:53,813
We're gonna need to see

00:07:53,813 --> 00:07:55,949
all your online correspondence
with this "Eater."

00:07:55,949 --> 00:07:57,083
All right, sure,

00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:58,852
but it won't help you track him.

00:07:58,852 --> 00:08:00,954
"Eater" was strictly anonymous.

00:08:00,954 --> 00:08:04,090
No way he's leaving
any digital breadcrumbs behind.

00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:06,059
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

00:08:06,059 --> 00:08:07,661
Well, he did leave us this.

00:08:07,661 --> 00:08:09,729

Named... Dennis Hagel.
You know him?

00:08:12,832 --> 00:08:15,936
Maybe he frequented
the same Vore sites.

00:08:15,936 --> 00:08:18,738
Maybe he shared
the same interests.

00:08:18,738 --> 00:08:20,740
Vegas local.

00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,809

making its way around
the online Vore community--

00:08:48,468 --> 00:08:51,404
a snuff film like
no one's ever seen before.

00:08:51,404 --> 00:08:53,473
According to Owen,

00:08:53,473 --> 00:08:55,575
this lady's name
is "Miss Feed."

00:08:55,575 --> 00:08:58,345
Hi, out there.

00:08:58,345 --> 00:09:01,748
It's another...
sunny day in Vegas.

00:09:01,748 --> 00:09:03,683
Want to have some fun?

00:09:03,683 --> 00:09:04,985
Webcam stripper.

00:09:04,985 --> 00:09:06,586
No, not really.

00:09:06,586 --> 00:09:09,622
She offers a unique service
to vore-heads like Owen

00:09:09,622 --> 00:09:11,024
that dream of being gobbled up.

00:09:11,024 --> 00:09:13,059
You look so yummy.

00:09:13,059 --> 00:09:16,096
Mmm. And I'm just so hungry.

00:09:16,096 --> 00:09:19,366
I can't wait...

00:09:19,366 --> 00:09:23,336
...to devour you.

00:09:23,336 --> 00:09:24,337
(gagging)

00:09:24,337 --> 00:09:25,939
This is new.

00:09:30,343 --> 00:09:31,611
Endoscopic camera.

00:09:31,611 --> 00:09:32,912
Possibly manned by

00:09:32,912 --> 00:09:34,581
our disarmed victim,
Dennis Hagel.

00:09:34,581 --> 00:09:36,816
Can't be too many people
with that skill-set

00:09:36,816 --> 00:09:38,084
involved with
this kind of stuff.

00:09:38,084 --> 00:09:39,419
Yeah.

00:09:42,722 --> 00:09:44,090
And we've reached her stomach.

00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:46,092
Lovely.

00:09:46,092 --> 00:09:47,093
(squishing)

00:09:47,093 --> 00:09:49,963
Whoa. What was that?

00:09:49,963 --> 00:09:53,066
Oh, my God.
It's a knife.

00:09:53,066 --> 00:09:54,801
She's getting stabbed.

00:09:54,801 --> 00:09:58,405
Let it play.

00:09:58,405 --> 00:10:00,407
(sloshing)

00:10:00,407 --> 00:10:02,909
All that blood--
an artery was hit.

00:10:02,909 --> 00:10:04,477
She's dying.

00:10:07,047 --> 00:10:11,584
Uh, wh-what does
the video's metadata say?

00:10:11,584 --> 00:10:13,386
Originated
three days ago,

00:10:13,386 --> 00:10:16,322
but it bounced through proxies,
obscuring any other information.

00:10:16,322 --> 00:10:19,325
So, we have a murder victim
with no name

00:10:19,325 --> 00:10:20,894
and no idea where
the crime scene is.

00:10:20,894 --> 00:10:23,496
Video's all we got to work with.

00:10:23,496 --> 00:10:26,466
Well, if we can stand
a closer look,

00:10:26,466 --> 00:10:28,668
there might be something in here
that can help us.

00:10:28,668 --> 00:10:31,438
Let's split it up.
Go frame by frame.

00:10:31,438 --> 00:10:33,573
Listen, Stephanie, why
don't we reschedule.

00:10:33,573 --> 00:10:36,509
I'm completely jammed up
in traffic on the Strip.

00:10:36,509 --> 00:10:37,844
Okay. Bye.

00:10:37,844 --> 00:10:40,080
Who you hiding from?

00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,682
Head of my share-free
election committee.

00:10:42,682 --> 00:10:45,618
A smart woman,
tons of energy, but...

00:10:45,618 --> 00:10:46,886
You can't stand her.

00:10:46,886 --> 00:10:48,688
Well, you're welcome
to take refuge

00:10:48,688 --> 00:10:49,789
in here if you want.

00:10:49,789 --> 00:10:51,758
I mean...

00:10:51,758 --> 00:10:53,927
election's over a year away.

00:10:53,927 --> 00:10:56,429
They're already pressuring me
about my image, my platform,

00:10:56,429 --> 00:10:58,431
soliciting contributions.

00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:01,367
Getting appointed, I avoided
that whole campaign circus.

00:11:01,367 --> 00:11:03,069
Well, no one's gonna run
against you this time.

00:11:03,069 --> 00:11:05,371
So, your job
should be safe, right?

00:11:05,371 --> 00:11:07,807
Well, that's
the other thing.

00:11:07,807 --> 00:11:12,045
I don't know if I want it.

00:11:12,045 --> 00:11:13,580
Really?

00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:16,449
Sometimes I miss the lab.

00:11:16,449 --> 00:11:19,552
The way you get to work
here, it's clean, honest.

00:11:19,552 --> 00:11:20,987
You don't have to
get your hands dirty.

00:11:20,987 --> 00:11:23,723
Well, for a Vegas sheriff,
your hands are pretty clean.

00:11:23,723 --> 00:11:25,458
Unless you've started

00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:28,094
planting bodies in the desert
like the good old days.

00:11:28,094 --> 00:11:30,330
Not yet, but I can certainly
understand the impulse.

00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:32,699
Some of the decisions I've
had to make in this job,

00:11:32,699 --> 00:11:34,667
some of the ugliness
in this town.

00:11:34,667 --> 00:11:37,871
We've had a big helping
of that today.

00:11:37,871 --> 00:11:40,006
Yeah.

00:11:40,006 --> 00:11:42,375
A killer with a taste
for human flesh,

00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:44,878
preying on those
who fantasize about it.

00:11:44,878 --> 00:11:45,879
That's the headline.

00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:47,313
Well, we better
solve it

00:11:47,313 --> 00:11:48,715
before it hits the news.

00:11:48,715 --> 00:11:51,050
Came by to see
what you got.

00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:53,720
Got a crazy story from one vic,

00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,054
an arm

00:11:55,054 --> 00:11:56,689
from another

00:11:56,689 --> 00:11:58,625
and a snuff film from the third.

00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:00,894
That's it?
No other physical evidence?

00:12:00,894 --> 00:12:02,529
No.

00:12:02,529 --> 00:12:06,432
And no reason to think
that this maniac is gonna stop.

00:12:06,432 --> 00:12:08,601
(sighs)

00:12:08,601 --> 00:12:11,838

Hey.

00:13:06,726 --> 00:13:08,661
So, it turns out,
trying to solve a murder

00:13:08,661 --> 00:13:11,531
from inside the victim
is a hell of a lot trickier

00:13:11,531 --> 00:13:13,533
than it sounds.
The best luck I've had

00:13:13,533 --> 00:13:15,034
is with the murder weapon.

00:13:15,034 --> 00:13:17,003
The knife is serrated.

00:13:17,003 --> 00:13:20,406
Same kind of knife that cut
our other two victims.

00:13:20,406 --> 00:13:24,410
And I noticed an unusual detail
in that freeze-frame.

00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:25,778
Engraved symbol.

00:13:25,778 --> 00:13:27,947
The Cyrillic name
of a Russian village.

00:13:27,947 --> 00:13:29,549
"Marilsk."

00:13:29,549 --> 00:13:31,384
So, either the killer
is from there

00:13:31,384 --> 00:13:32,585
or just a collector.

00:13:32,585 --> 00:13:33,987
Either way,

00:13:33,987 --> 00:13:36,856
we still have no idea
who or where "Miss Feed" is.

00:13:36,856 --> 00:13:39,359
Actually, we do.
As luck should have it,

00:13:39,359 --> 00:13:40,927
her strange eating habits
weren't just limited

00:13:40,927 --> 00:13:42,662
to her work.
I noticed this

00:13:42,662 --> 00:13:44,564
in my analysis of
the stomach video.

00:13:44,564 --> 00:13:48,034
Jelly donut wrapped
around hamburger.

00:13:48,034 --> 00:13:50,637
There's only one place in town
that serves that sandwich.

00:13:50,637 --> 00:13:53,640
Hangover Grill--
and I'm never going there again.

00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,974
I got the credit card receipts

00:13:54,974 --> 00:13:56,342
from the day
"Miss Feed" was killed,

00:13:56,342 --> 00:13:59,779
and I ran them
through DMV.

00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:02,448
"Miss Feed" is actually
Miss Brenda Waring.

00:14:02,448 --> 00:14:06,819
Her home address
is in Henderson.

00:14:06,819 --> 00:14:09,756
LVPD!

BRODY:

Cameraman.

00:14:39,886 --> 00:14:41,421
We got it.

00:14:41,421 --> 00:14:42,622
Why don't you
get some air.

00:14:42,622 --> 00:14:43,790
Thank you.

00:14:49,529 --> 00:14:52,098
Brenda Waring wasn't
just killed, she was butchered.

00:14:58,971 --> 00:15:01,507
Salt and sage.

00:15:01,507 --> 00:15:04,377

causing this picture
to go crooked.

00:15:58,765 --> 00:16:00,400
Brenda was meticulous,
very organized.

00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,801
I don't think
she would've let it

00:16:01,801 --> 00:16:03,669
stay like that
for even a minute.

00:16:03,669 --> 00:16:05,438

We know that moments before

00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:10,943
she was murdered, Brenda was
back there with Dennis

00:16:10,943 --> 00:16:12,412
doing a cam session.

Any sign of forced entry?
No.

00:16:21,421 --> 00:16:23,523
Do you know what? She could've
left the door unlocked.

00:16:23,523 --> 00:16:25,958
Nice neighborhood,
middle of the day-- why not?

All the darkness,
all the weirdness

00:16:28,027 --> 00:16:31,631
was kept in this corner

00:16:31,631 --> 00:16:33,800
Till it came storming in.

00:16:42,809 --> 00:16:45,077
SIDLE: Single, sharp-force wound
to the neck.

00:16:45,077 --> 00:16:49,315
Severed the carotid
jugular complex.

Dozen stab wounds centered
around her stomach.

00:16:57,824 --> 00:17:00,993
That's quite a statement,
considering her line of work.

00:17:00,993 --> 00:17:02,728
Assailant had to know her
as "Miss Feed."

00:17:02,728 --> 00:17:05,097
Maybe an obsessed
or jilted client.

00:17:05,097 --> 00:17:07,400
After consuming Brenda,

00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:12,672
the psycho didn't seem
to have an appetite for Dennis.

00:17:12,672 --> 00:17:14,874
Apparently, uh,

00:17:14,874 --> 00:17:16,309
he bagged Dennis's arm to go.

00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:17,710
It might not have been
all he took.

00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:19,946
I haven't been able to find

00:17:19,946 --> 00:17:22,482
a purse anywhere around here.

00:17:22,482 --> 00:17:24,584
No wallet.

00:17:24,584 --> 00:17:27,520
A cannibal, a killer...

00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,690
and a thief?

00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:32,592
HODGES: In some
cannibalistic cultures,

00:17:32,592 --> 00:17:35,027
it was believed that
eating someone's flesh

00:17:35,027 --> 00:17:37,830
was a way to absorb
their strength,

00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:41,334
their, uh, spiritual
essence, their wisdom,

00:17:41,334 --> 00:17:42,368
their skills.

00:17:42,368 --> 00:17:44,871
You've studied this?

00:17:44,871 --> 00:17:46,506
Caribbean cruise
when I was 11.

00:17:46,506 --> 00:17:48,641
I was prepared
for any encounters.

00:17:48,641 --> 00:17:52,011
So, I was thinking,
"Miss Feed"

00:17:52,011 --> 00:17:54,347
feasted on all of those clients.

00:17:54,347 --> 00:17:57,083
So, maybe the killer
was after her,

00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:59,886
fed on her
because he saw her

00:17:59,886 --> 00:18:02,555
as a sort of
human turducken.

00:18:02,555 --> 00:18:06,626
All those spirits
inside of her...

00:18:06,626 --> 00:18:09,829
would make for a
very powerful meal.

00:18:09,829 --> 00:18:12,498
But "Miss Feed"
only dealt in simulation.

00:18:12,498 --> 00:18:15,001
She never actually
ingested any flesh.

00:18:15,001 --> 00:18:17,403
This killer
is brunching on people.

00:18:17,403 --> 00:18:19,071
His logic might be
slightly out of whack.

00:18:19,071 --> 00:18:20,072
(cell phone vibrates)

00:18:20,072 --> 00:18:22,508
He's also out of cash.

00:18:22,508 --> 00:18:25,645
Just got a hit that someone used
Brenda Waring's credit card.

00:18:28,381 --> 00:18:31,050
Charging up
your sister's plastic?

00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:33,519
That's a strange way of grieving
your sister's death, Colleen.

00:18:37,957 --> 00:18:40,393
Yeah, I stole from Brenda.

00:18:40,393 --> 00:18:41,961
But that was
five days ago.

00:18:41,961 --> 00:18:43,529
I didn't hurt her.

00:18:43,529 --> 00:18:44,997
I was in jail
until this morning

00:18:44,997 --> 00:18:47,033
when I used her card.

00:18:47,033 --> 00:18:49,902
We know that you didn't
kill your sister, Colleen.

00:18:49,902 --> 00:18:51,971
You were locked up
at the time of the murder.

00:18:51,971 --> 00:18:53,506
Meth possession.

00:18:53,506 --> 00:18:57,343
But maybe you know
who did this to Brenda.

00:18:57,343 --> 00:19:00,413
(crying):
I told her they would hurt her.

00:19:00,413 --> 00:19:03,482
Kind of guys who'd ask her
to do those things.

00:19:03,482 --> 00:19:05,418
She's tempting them.

00:19:05,418 --> 00:19:06,886
And the demons
wouldn't stay boxed

00:19:06,886 --> 00:19:09,021
inside the computer forever.

00:19:09,021 --> 00:19:11,490
I tried to warn her.

00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:14,961
All the wicked people out there.

00:19:18,397 --> 00:19:21,100
So, these, uh,
demons you mentioned--

00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:24,437
the clients that
your sister performed for--

00:19:24,437 --> 00:19:28,507
did she ever tell you
about any of them?

00:19:30,343 --> 00:19:32,912
Problems she may have had
with them?

00:19:32,912 --> 00:19:35,548
Last time I saw her
was five days ago.

00:19:35,548 --> 00:19:37,850
And something...

00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:40,853
somebody had scared her.

00:19:40,853 --> 00:19:43,456
Brenda, if one of those online
pervs said something to you,

00:19:43,456 --> 00:19:44,690
threatened you...

00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:46,325
It wasn't one of my clients.

00:19:46,325 --> 00:19:47,927
It's fine.

00:19:47,927 --> 00:19:49,395
I don't know why you even
deal with these freaks!

00:19:49,395 --> 00:19:50,596
They need me.

00:19:50,596 --> 00:19:51,731
These urges
that some of them have--

00:19:51,731 --> 00:19:52,999
if I can't help them,

00:19:52,999 --> 00:19:54,667
they could end up
hurting themselves.

00:19:54,667 --> 00:19:57,603
You can understand
that, right?

00:19:57,603 --> 00:19:59,572
And if you came here for
money to use, forget it.

00:19:59,572 --> 00:20:01,374
(door slams)

00:20:01,374 --> 00:20:03,776
COLLEEN: <i>She wouldn't give me</i>
<i>what I wanted,</i>

00:20:03,776 --> 00:20:05,811
<i>so I took it.</i>

00:20:05,811 --> 00:20:09,448
I scavenged what I
could get from her.

00:20:09,448 --> 00:20:10,650
(sobs softly)

00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:12,551
And now she's gone.

00:20:15,087 --> 00:20:17,356
Okay, this is totally
none of my business,

00:20:17,356 --> 00:20:19,425
but did I hear that

00:20:19,425 --> 00:20:20,626
you asked Nick out?

00:20:20,626 --> 00:20:22,695
No, I did not ask Nick out.

00:20:22,695 --> 00:20:24,363
But we do have
a work date.

00:20:24,363 --> 00:20:27,033
We're going
to this party.

00:20:27,033 --> 00:20:29,035
"The Feast of the Cannibals"?

00:20:29,035 --> 00:20:31,604
Yeah, I found
the invite

00:20:31,604 --> 00:20:34,006
in Brenda Waring's
recovered purse.

00:20:34,006 --> 00:20:37,677
"Join us to indulge your palate
for the darkest of delicacies,

00:20:37,677 --> 00:20:40,479
among the city's
most refined aficionados."

00:20:40,479 --> 00:20:42,348
This can't be real.

00:20:42,348 --> 00:20:44,717
The address is at a
foreclosed-on mansion

00:20:44,717 --> 00:20:46,085
in Seven Hills,

00:20:46,085 --> 00:20:47,787
so it's gonna be a party
of trespassers.

00:20:47,787 --> 00:20:49,422
But I think it's a
good chance to talk

00:20:49,422 --> 00:20:50,690
to these "vore" freaks
in the flesh.

00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:52,358
See if they know anything
about the murders

00:20:52,358 --> 00:20:54,694
at "Miss Feed's"
and the elusive "Eater."

00:20:54,694 --> 00:20:56,529
Fetish is
a small community.

00:20:56,529 --> 00:20:58,731
There's got to be somebody at
the party who knows something.

00:20:58,731 --> 00:21:01,967
Yeah, maybe even our killer
cannibal himself will be there.

00:21:01,967 --> 00:21:05,004
Mm-hmm. Well, don't wear
anything too appetizing.

00:21:09,608 --> 00:21:10,976
(crickets chirping)

00:21:10,976 --> 00:21:13,412
(gate creaks)

00:21:13,412 --> 00:21:15,815
Want to check in
with our chaperone?

00:21:15,815 --> 00:21:17,883
Uh, backup, we're
approaching the house.

00:21:17,883 --> 00:21:19,385
Copy?

00:21:19,385 --> 00:21:21,854
MAN (over earpiece):
Copy. Standing by.

00:21:30,029 --> 00:21:38,003
♪ ♪

00:21:55,654 --> 00:22:03,596
♪ ♪

00:22:08,901 --> 00:22:09,969
(glass clinking)

00:22:09,969 --> 00:22:11,737
MAN:
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:22:11,737 --> 00:22:14,774
it's time to put aside
your hors d'oeuvres

00:22:14,774 --> 00:22:16,776
and your idle chatter,
because tonight's entrée

00:22:16,776 --> 00:22:19,812
is something...

00:22:19,812 --> 00:22:22,548
far more substantial.

00:22:28,587 --> 00:22:31,524
I sincerely hope
that you all have

00:22:31,524 --> 00:22:34,360
the stomach for it.

00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,530
(crowd murmuring)

00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,004
419 inside location.
Make entry.

00:22:45,004 --> 00:22:46,872
Quite the
feeding frenzy,

00:22:46,872 --> 00:22:48,407
isn't it?

00:22:48,407 --> 00:22:49,675
Choice cuts
for the newcomers?

00:22:54,013 --> 00:22:55,047
Gelatin.
Hmm.

00:22:55,047 --> 00:22:56,448
MAN:
LVPD!

00:22:56,448 --> 00:22:58,350
Everyone on the floor!

00:22:58,350 --> 00:22:59,618
Face down!

00:23:03,489 --> 00:23:04,824
Me too?

00:23:16,635 --> 00:23:18,504
Oh, it's a warm, fuzzy feeling

00:23:18,504 --> 00:23:21,907
to know you guys would've been
here for me if this was real.

00:23:21,907 --> 00:23:24,343
The gelatin's
not bad-tasting,

00:23:24,343 --> 00:23:25,678
really.

00:23:25,678 --> 00:23:27,746
No, no, I'm good.

00:23:27,746 --> 00:23:29,715
So, you were hired
by these people, huh?

00:23:29,715 --> 00:23:32,751
Hundred bucks to lie there
and let them snack on me.

00:23:32,751 --> 00:23:34,787
Some trippy
fetish thing, I guess.

00:23:34,787 --> 00:23:36,822
C-note's a C-note.

00:23:36,822 --> 00:23:38,490
Yeah, it is.

00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:42,661
And that should just about cover
your trespassing ticket.

00:23:42,661 --> 00:23:45,531
I assure you, the feast
is a perfectly benign

00:23:45,531 --> 00:23:49,001
role-playing fantasy
among consenting adults.

00:23:49,001 --> 00:23:52,071
Predators and prey,
all pretend.

00:23:52,071 --> 00:23:54,406
Well, there's someone out there
who shares your appetites,

00:23:54,406 --> 00:23:56,742
but who is definitely
not pretending.

00:23:56,742 --> 00:23:58,744
Do tell.

00:23:58,744 --> 00:24:02,514
Nothing gets gobbled up faster
around here than gossip.

00:24:07,453 --> 00:24:09,488
That's an interesting
cuff link, Mr. Korlov.

00:24:09,488 --> 00:24:11,056
It's an heirloom.

00:24:11,056 --> 00:24:13,792
It's the crest of my
ancestors' village.

00:24:13,792 --> 00:24:17,529
It's a bloody family
saga worthy of Tolstoy.

00:24:17,529 --> 00:24:20,065
I could talk your
lovely ear off with it.

00:24:20,065 --> 00:24:22,501
Think I'll keep my ear.

00:24:22,501 --> 00:24:25,070
Is there someplace more private
where we could speak?

00:24:29,875 --> 00:24:32,044
Brenda.

00:24:32,044 --> 00:24:34,813
So you knew her--
not just as "Miss Feed."

00:24:34,813 --> 00:24:36,015
What happened?

00:24:36,015 --> 00:24:37,783
She and her cameraman,
Dennis Hagel,

00:24:37,783 --> 00:24:39,818
were murdered.

00:24:39,818 --> 00:24:40,953
Butchered.

00:24:40,953 --> 00:24:42,888
Parts of them were eaten.

00:24:42,888 --> 00:24:43,923
For real.

00:24:43,923 --> 00:24:47,092
And the knife...

00:24:47,092 --> 00:24:49,561
that was used
in the slaughter

00:24:49,561 --> 00:24:54,366
has the same symbol
as on your cufflinks, Gary.

00:25:00,072 --> 00:25:03,042
I know what it is to live
in the jaws of a compulsion--

00:25:03,042 --> 00:25:05,778
to have one
sinister impulse

00:25:05,778 --> 00:25:08,914
ticking, relentless,
through your every fiber.

00:25:08,914 --> 00:25:12,685
But my impulse is not
to feed on flesh.

00:25:17,823 --> 00:25:21,460
Mr. Korlov...

00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:23,095
Rather, to be fed upon.

00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,434
"Miss Feed..."

00:25:28,434 --> 00:25:29,835
Brenda... was an angel.

00:25:29,835 --> 00:25:31,070
She was helping me

00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:33,872
to heal from this.

00:25:33,872 --> 00:25:35,674
What happened to you?

00:25:37,843 --> 00:25:41,780
KORLOV: <i>I met this</i>
<i>pitch-black soul online,</i>

00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:43,916
<i>a man named "Eater."</i>

00:25:43,916 --> 00:25:46,318
<i>I brought him offerings--</i>

00:25:46,318 --> 00:25:50,356
<i>pieces of my flesh,</i>
<i>surgically removed.</i>

00:25:50,356 --> 00:25:54,860
<i>"Eater" would dine</i>
<i>on my offerings.</i>

00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:58,964
The arrangement was
mutually satisfying.

00:25:58,964 --> 00:26:02,868
I gave him that antique knife
as a gift,

00:26:02,868 --> 00:26:07,473
to use during our dinners.

00:26:07,473 --> 00:26:08,874
<i>It was bliss.</i>

00:26:08,874 --> 00:26:11,677
<i>I knew it would destroy me,</i>

00:26:11,677 --> 00:26:13,746
<i>piece by piece,</i>

00:26:13,746 --> 00:26:17,616
so I sought out Brenda.

00:26:17,616 --> 00:26:20,652
Seeking salvation
through her services.

00:26:20,652 --> 00:26:22,087
So you were one of her clients

00:26:22,087 --> 00:26:23,589
that she would
virtually consume.

00:26:23,589 --> 00:26:25,357
Yes.

00:26:25,357 --> 00:26:29,328
And I-I told "Eater"
I'd found a healthier way

00:26:29,328 --> 00:26:31,764
to... quench my impulses.

00:26:31,764 --> 00:26:33,065
And how did he take that?

00:26:33,065 --> 00:26:36,802
Having food ripped
from his mouth?

00:26:36,802 --> 00:26:40,672
Evidently, not well.

00:26:40,672 --> 00:26:42,941
You were face-to-face
with "Eater."

00:26:42,941 --> 00:26:46,912
Did you get a good look at him?

00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:50,883
KORLOV: <i>Yes. I looked</i>
<i>right into his eyes.</i>

00:26:52,551 --> 00:26:54,053
SIDLE:
If you believe him,

00:26:54,053 --> 00:26:55,921
Gary Korlov said
that he was blindfolded

00:26:55,921 --> 00:26:58,624
on trips to and from
"Eater's" place,

00:26:58,624 --> 00:27:01,060
but he was permitted to watch
"Eater" dine on his flesh.

00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,594
That's only fair,
I guess.

00:27:02,594 --> 00:27:06,065
Korlov cooperated
on a police sketch of "Eater."

00:27:06,065 --> 00:27:09,535
So, we still don't know where
this guy's "dining room" is?

00:27:09,535 --> 00:27:11,003
That's what we're
working on now,

00:27:11,003 --> 00:27:13,105
starting with the fact
that Owen Linder--

00:27:13,105 --> 00:27:17,009
our escaped victim--
ended up here...

00:27:17,009 --> 00:27:18,544
...and he couldn't run too far

00:27:18,544 --> 00:27:19,678
from "Eater's" lair.

00:27:19,678 --> 00:27:22,414
Let's call it a one-mile radius.

00:27:22,414 --> 00:27:23,816
Korlov recalled
certain details of his visits.

00:27:23,816 --> 00:27:25,584
He said it felt like
an industrial space,

00:27:25,584 --> 00:27:27,686
and he said on one visit,
he heard a train

00:27:27,686 --> 00:27:29,922
<i>that was close enough</i>
<i>to disturb the dinner.</i>

00:27:29,922 --> 00:27:32,458
Rails cut through the north end
of that search radius.

00:27:32,458 --> 00:27:35,594
Well, let's lose
the south half.

00:27:35,594 --> 00:27:37,029
Mm.

00:27:37,029 --> 00:27:39,531
It is still
way too much ground to cover.

00:27:39,531 --> 00:27:40,766
Factories,
warehouses.

00:27:40,766 --> 00:27:43,535
RUSSELL:
Mm.

00:27:45,337 --> 00:27:47,406
SANDERS:
You know,

00:27:47,406 --> 00:27:49,675
Linder had said something
in his first interview--

00:27:49,675 --> 00:27:52,478
we thought he was just a
nut job with a crazy story--

00:27:52,478 --> 00:27:56,715
but he said he smelled...
brimstone while being attacked.

00:27:56,715 --> 00:27:59,985
Brimstone? Sulfur.

00:27:59,985 --> 00:28:03,956
SANDERS: This company here
produces organic pesticides.

00:28:03,956 --> 00:28:06,358
Sulfur is a major
component of those.

00:28:08,727 --> 00:28:10,062
RUSSELL:
Well, the company may have

00:28:10,062 --> 00:28:12,364
gone out of business
a couple years ago,

00:28:12,364 --> 00:28:14,733
but the odor of sulfur
would have lingered.

00:28:14,733 --> 00:28:17,736
May not be the only thing
hanging around there.

00:28:20,372 --> 00:28:24,343
(heavy door creaks open)

00:28:34,386 --> 00:28:36,088
Padlock on the door

00:28:36,088 --> 00:28:39,758
and not a soul around.

00:28:39,758 --> 00:28:41,093
Perfect place
for "Eater" to feed.

00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:46,598
Smells like bleach.

00:28:50,369 --> 00:28:52,804
SANDERS:
He cleaned up.

00:29:06,418 --> 00:29:08,487
He knew we'd
be coming.

00:29:08,487 --> 00:29:10,322
He set the table for us.

00:29:10,322 --> 00:29:14,092
SIDLE: Murder weapon,
napkin left like that--

00:29:14,092 --> 00:29:15,894
does it mean he's done?

00:29:15,894 --> 00:29:19,064
Or just done
with the first course.

00:29:19,064 --> 00:29:21,934
ECKLIE: <i>A dead end?</i>
<i>Greg and Sara didn't find</i>

00:29:21,934 --> 00:29:25,437
any prints, DNA?

00:29:25,437 --> 00:29:26,505
All right.

00:29:26,505 --> 00:29:29,808
Uh... keep me
looped in, D.B.

00:29:29,808 --> 00:29:31,643
Sorry, Bill.

00:29:31,643 --> 00:29:33,045
Crime lab.

00:29:33,045 --> 00:29:35,347
When I was sheriff,
that department was three geeks

00:29:35,347 --> 00:29:37,349
with a microscope
I believe they ordered

00:29:37,349 --> 00:29:39,051
off the back
of a comic book.

00:29:39,051 --> 00:29:40,519
(chuckles)
Hard to think the lab

00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:42,654
ever produced a man
fit for the tin star,

00:29:42,654 --> 00:29:43,889
but you've proven yourself.

00:29:43,889 --> 00:29:45,557
Well, I appreciate that.

00:29:45,557 --> 00:29:47,960
Now you're telling me
you want to pansy out,

00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,328
retreat from your duty?

00:29:49,328 --> 00:29:50,729
No, I'll complete
my term.

00:29:50,729 --> 00:29:52,564
I'm just not sure...
whether to run again.

00:29:52,564 --> 00:29:54,633
That's why I wanted
to talk to you.

00:29:54,633 --> 00:29:56,401
I've been doing some
thinking...
Eh, thinking is

00:29:56,401 --> 00:29:58,003
crime lab stuff-- sheriff
doesn't have to think.

00:29:58,003 --> 00:30:00,405
Sheriff has a gut
tells him what to do.

00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:06,311
I hear you.

00:30:08,947 --> 00:30:12,384
Listen, Conrad...

00:30:12,384 --> 00:30:14,753
I know the job's
rough as hell,

00:30:14,753 --> 00:30:17,022
politics can be bloodier
than the crime scenes,

00:30:17,022 --> 00:30:19,758
and with the... the scrutiny
you're under nowadays,

00:30:19,758 --> 00:30:23,629
you don't even have
some of the... release valves

00:30:23,629 --> 00:30:26,098
sheriffs used
to be afforded.

00:30:26,098 --> 00:30:27,966
But here's the thing:

00:30:27,966 --> 00:30:31,670
you're the sheriff,
and you don't answer to anyone.

00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:35,941
Not your campaign staff
or the crime lab

00:30:35,941 --> 00:30:37,809
or not even your own voice
in your own head

00:30:37,809 --> 00:30:39,077
when it starts doubting you.

00:30:39,077 --> 00:30:40,779
You're the sheriff,
and you make it

00:30:40,779 --> 00:30:42,948
so the people in this city
can sleep at night.

00:30:42,948 --> 00:30:44,783
That's it.

00:30:44,783 --> 00:30:47,319
And you're gonna
keep doing that.

00:30:49,688 --> 00:30:52,324
Thanks, Bill.

00:30:52,324 --> 00:30:55,727
Now, what's this I hear
about a killer cannibal?

00:30:55,727 --> 00:30:57,696
Tell me you got
this creep in a cage.

00:30:57,696 --> 00:30:59,564
I wish I could.
All we've got now

00:30:59,564 --> 00:31:02,000
is a sketch
of the suspect.

00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,502
Just released it
to the press.

00:31:03,502 --> 00:31:06,605
That face on the news--
every numbskull

00:31:06,605 --> 00:31:10,008
in the city is gonna be spinning
a Stephen King story for you.

00:31:10,008 --> 00:31:14,980
You're supposed to be curing
nightmares, not causing them.

00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,848
NEWSMAN: Police are asking
anyone with information

00:31:16,848 --> 00:31:19,051
on the suspect
to call their tip line.

00:31:19,051 --> 00:31:23,088
Sir, you-you believe
you saw the suspect?

00:31:23,088 --> 00:31:25,624
I'm sorry,
did you say "undead"?

00:31:25,624 --> 00:31:27,059
All this says something

00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:29,661
about our city's
collective imagination.

00:31:29,661 --> 00:31:31,863
Or maybe their
amphetamine use.

00:31:31,863 --> 00:31:33,465
MAN: Listen to me!
I'm telling you,

00:31:33,465 --> 00:31:35,634
I got him! I caught
the cannibal!

00:31:35,634 --> 00:31:37,502
What's going on?
I swear to God,

00:31:37,502 --> 00:31:38,970
I got him cuffed up
in the car outside!

00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:40,038
Somebody help me!

00:31:40,038 --> 00:31:42,708
Send Stokes out here.

00:31:42,708 --> 00:31:45,010
Come here.

00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:48,347
He's right over here.

00:31:48,347 --> 00:31:50,682
Uh... right here.
Right here.

00:31:50,682 --> 00:31:52,484
He's right, uh...

00:31:52,484 --> 00:31:53,852
What?

00:31:53,852 --> 00:31:55,754
No... What...?

00:31:55,754 --> 00:31:57,055
Give me your light.

00:32:11,503 --> 00:32:14,072
Our cannibal ate his way out?

00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:29,321
♪ ♪

00:32:50,776 --> 00:32:52,043
The hell
were you thinking,

00:32:52,043 --> 00:32:53,445
trying to bring him
here yourself?

00:32:53,445 --> 00:32:54,946
Why didn't you
call it in?

00:32:54,946 --> 00:32:56,782
I saw him, I just reacted.
It's my training.

00:32:56,782 --> 00:32:58,083
Your training?

00:32:58,083 --> 00:32:59,818
You're an office
security guard;

00:32:59,818 --> 00:33:01,653
you don't apprehend
serial killers.

00:33:01,653 --> 00:33:03,488
Well, apparently,
neither do you guys.

00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:08,693
Take a seat, Todd.

00:33:08,693 --> 00:33:10,495
Let's just get
this all straight.

00:33:10,495 --> 00:33:12,531
So you saw this guy
outside your building...

00:33:12,531 --> 00:33:15,100
I was at my watch post;
and I'd seen

00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,935
the news, the sketch
of the suspect.

00:33:16,935 --> 00:33:19,438
And there he was.

00:33:19,438 --> 00:33:21,606
Same awful face
just passing by outside.

00:33:21,606 --> 00:33:23,442
So, I grabbed my Taser,
I went out there...

00:33:23,442 --> 00:33:24,910
You zapped him.

00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:27,446
I tackled him and I cuffed him
in my car.

00:33:27,446 --> 00:33:28,947
Did he say anything
when you were driving here?

00:33:28,947 --> 00:33:32,384
No, he was silent.
He was just staring at me.

00:33:32,384 --> 00:33:35,086
Waiting for his chance.

00:33:40,459 --> 00:33:42,060
No hits on the prints

00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:45,630
or DNA from the hand, but
with an injury like that,

00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:47,866
I'm guessing, suspect's not
getting very far anyway.

00:33:47,866 --> 00:33:49,100
That would be true

00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,969
if this were the suspect's hand.

00:33:50,969 --> 00:33:53,738
What are you talking about?
Once the wound was cleaned,

00:33:53,738 --> 00:33:56,308
the tissue exhibited
significant deterioration.

00:33:56,308 --> 00:33:58,310
That hand was disembodied
at least 24 hours ago.

00:33:58,310 --> 00:34:00,312
Really?

00:34:00,312 --> 00:34:02,314
PHILLIPS: And the tool marks
on the ligament indicate

00:34:02,314 --> 00:34:06,485
that a knife was used,
not teeth.

00:34:06,485 --> 00:34:09,988
The security guard is a liar.

00:34:09,988 --> 00:34:11,890
You know why
we're in here, Todd?

00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:13,692
'Cause the only real thing
about your story

00:34:13,692 --> 00:34:15,760
is a severed human hand.

00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,762
Whose hand is it?
I don't know.

00:34:17,762 --> 00:34:19,030
ECKLIE:
You killed somebody.

00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:20,866
You took their hand
to fake a story,

00:34:20,866 --> 00:34:22,634
to make yourself
look like a hero.

00:34:22,634 --> 00:34:25,437
No! I didn't
hurt anyone.

00:34:27,906 --> 00:34:29,641
He gave it to me.

00:34:29,641 --> 00:34:30,709
Who gave it to you?

00:34:30,709 --> 00:34:33,078
Him.

00:34:33,078 --> 00:34:34,679
The cannibal.

00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:36,348
Enough. Listen to me,
you twisted little...

00:34:36,348 --> 00:34:37,916
I'm not lying!

00:34:37,916 --> 00:34:40,318
He approached me one night
when I was at work alone.

00:34:40,318 --> 00:34:44,356
I don't know why
he chose me, but he did.

00:34:44,356 --> 00:34:46,691
He knew the names of my
little niece and nephew.

00:34:46,691 --> 00:34:48,326
He had pictures.

00:34:48,326 --> 00:34:50,729
He said that if I
didn't do this for him,

00:34:50,729 --> 00:34:53,932
that he was gonna...

00:34:55,934 --> 00:34:59,070
He gave me the hand
and a bottle of blood,

00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:01,973
and he told me what he wanted it
to look like.

00:35:10,482 --> 00:35:12,050
I was just supposed
to drive here

00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:13,652
and say that I'd caught
the cannibal.

00:35:13,652 --> 00:35:14,819
Give it a rest.

00:35:14,819 --> 00:35:16,021
You can understand,

00:35:16,021 --> 00:35:18,490
this is all a little bit
hard to believe.

00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:22,027
I'm a good person.

00:35:22,027 --> 00:35:24,696
I-I never would've thought

00:35:24,696 --> 00:35:27,399
that I'd cooperate with
a monster like that.

00:35:27,399 --> 00:35:32,037
And it wasn't even the threat--
my niece and nephew.

00:35:33,572 --> 00:35:35,574
There was something
about this guy.

00:35:35,574 --> 00:35:37,409
When he was near me,

00:35:37,409 --> 00:35:38,977
there was this...

00:35:38,977 --> 00:35:41,780
this power...

00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:44,950
buzzing off of him.

00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:48,353
He could get you to do
whatever he wanted.

00:35:48,353 --> 00:35:50,422
Like you were
face-to-face

00:35:50,422 --> 00:35:54,793
with the Devil himself.

00:35:57,329 --> 00:35:58,964
(gasping)
Todd? Todd!

00:35:58,964 --> 00:36:00,899
Hey, Dad, this is for real.

00:36:00,899 --> 00:36:02,100
Todd?

00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,102
Todd? Okay, okay,
turn your head.

00:36:04,102 --> 00:36:06,404
He's seizing.
Keep your tongue...

00:36:06,404 --> 00:36:07,772
ECKLIE:
Get medical!

00:36:18,683 --> 00:36:19,951
Any word?

00:36:19,951 --> 00:36:22,520
Todd Burris is dead.
Cyanide poisoning.

00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,888
Hospital ran tox

00:36:23,888 --> 00:36:26,591
and gave us his possessions
and clothing.

00:36:26,591 --> 00:36:27,826
Maybe he dosed himself.

00:36:27,826 --> 00:36:29,728
Could've snuck a pill
into PD.

00:36:29,728 --> 00:36:31,863
Once his story started
unraveling,

00:36:31,863 --> 00:36:34,866
he knew he was gonna
get arrested, humiliated.

00:36:34,866 --> 00:36:36,601
Didn't want to face it.

00:36:36,601 --> 00:36:38,803
Or the matter of where exactly
he got that human hand.

00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,942
What if there's some truth
to Todd's story?

00:36:43,942 --> 00:36:47,078
He spent his dying
words telling it.

00:36:47,078 --> 00:36:50,448
Okay, I suppose
last words deserve a chance.

00:36:50,448 --> 00:36:53,985
So, according to Todd,
the cannibal forced him

00:36:53,985 --> 00:36:56,454
to stage the bloody scene
in the car.

00:36:56,454 --> 00:36:57,555
But why would he do that?

00:36:57,555 --> 00:36:59,824
I mean, just to mess
with the cops?

00:36:59,824 --> 00:37:03,828
SIDLE: Maybe to fuel the fire
of his own myth.

00:37:03,828 --> 00:37:06,398
You know, the tale of
the killer cannibal who eats

00:37:06,398 --> 00:37:07,832
through his own wrist to escape.

00:37:07,832 --> 00:37:10,435
That's boogeyman-level stuff.

00:37:10,435 --> 00:37:11,870
Lives on in urban legend.

00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:16,007
So, "Eater" uses Todd
to spread his tale,

00:37:16,007 --> 00:37:20,011
then somehow
magically doses him

00:37:20,011 --> 00:37:22,013
with cyanide
to take him out.

00:37:22,013 --> 00:37:25,784
Or Todd was just
another attention hound

00:37:25,784 --> 00:37:26,951
with a vivid imagination.

00:37:31,923 --> 00:37:34,759
He didn't imagine it.

00:37:34,759 --> 00:37:36,394
This watch belonged
to Dennis Hagel,

00:37:36,394 --> 00:37:37,629
our slain cameraman.

00:37:37,629 --> 00:37:39,631
And this fabric...

00:37:39,631 --> 00:37:41,466
Ripped from Brenda
Waring's lingerie.

00:37:41,466 --> 00:37:42,901
Tokens from our victims.

00:37:42,901 --> 00:37:44,869
Why?

00:37:44,869 --> 00:37:48,039
Maybe "Eater's" trying to send
a message that he's real.

00:37:49,774 --> 00:37:53,445
There is another
possibility

00:37:53,445 --> 00:37:55,447
how Todd could have
these items

00:37:55,447 --> 00:37:57,515
and why he would use
his last dying words

00:37:57,515 --> 00:37:59,918
to spread the myth of "Eater."

00:37:59,918 --> 00:38:02,387
There was this...

00:38:02,387 --> 00:38:05,657
power buzzing off of him.

00:38:05,657 --> 00:38:08,560
SANDERS: <i>To paint an image,</i>
<i>more than just a killer,</i>

00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,994
<i>but as something supernatural.</i>

00:38:09,994 --> 00:38:13,531
Like you were face-to-face
with the Devil himself.

00:38:13,531 --> 00:38:16,801
What if the myth he was
spreading was his own?

00:38:16,801 --> 00:38:19,938
Todd Burris was "Eater."

00:38:19,938 --> 00:38:22,841
Did these horrific acts,
took tokens from his victims.

00:38:22,841 --> 00:38:26,044
All because he wanted
to create his own legend.

00:38:26,044 --> 00:38:29,681
To live on, not just as some
no-name rent-a-cop...

00:38:29,681 --> 00:38:32,917
But as the nightmare
that devoured and disappeared.

00:38:37,088 --> 00:38:40,825
FINLAY: Mr. Korlov,
the man you knew as "Eater,"

00:38:40,825 --> 00:38:44,929
with whom
you had those meals...

00:38:44,929 --> 00:38:46,965
...is this him?

00:38:53,838 --> 00:38:55,440
This is just flesh.

00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,009
You can't tell the
true essence of a man

00:38:58,009 --> 00:38:59,544
just by looking
at his flesh.

00:38:59,544 --> 00:39:01,579
I asked you a question.

00:39:01,579 --> 00:39:04,649
And I would appreciate
an answer.

00:39:04,649 --> 00:39:06,451
The being that I dealt with

00:39:06,451 --> 00:39:10,088
looked just like I described
to you and your sketch artist.

00:39:10,088 --> 00:39:14,859
A gaunt, glinty-eyed
Lucifer himself.

00:39:14,859 --> 00:39:17,061
Are you sure you want
to stick with that story?

00:39:17,061 --> 00:39:19,798
Because when we find out
that you're lying,

00:39:19,798 --> 00:39:21,666
there will be consequences.

00:39:24,469 --> 00:39:27,105
I'm going to ask you
one more time.

00:39:27,105 --> 00:39:31,342
Is this the man
you knew as "Eater"?

00:39:34,412 --> 00:39:37,715
A force like "Eater" will
never be captured like this.

00:39:37,715 --> 00:39:39,717
ECKLIE:
<i>That's the horror story</i>

00:39:39,717 --> 00:39:40,985
they want us to believe.

00:39:40,985 --> 00:39:42,720
Todd Burris and
Gary Korlov

00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,355
were in this together.

00:39:44,355 --> 00:39:46,624
A murderer and his PR man.

00:39:46,624 --> 00:39:49,427
You know, we don't
know that for sure.

00:39:49,427 --> 00:39:50,628
(sighs)

00:39:50,628 --> 00:39:52,397
Autopsy on Burris

00:39:52,397 --> 00:39:55,500
didn't find any human tissue
in his stomach contents.

00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:58,636
D.B., the last victim
was attacked two days ago.

00:39:58,636 --> 00:39:59,904
Evidence was already digested.

00:39:59,904 --> 00:40:01,773
And search of
Burris's home

00:40:01,773 --> 00:40:03,641
didn't find trace from
any of the victims.

00:40:03,641 --> 00:40:05,543
So he was careful.
What's your point?

00:40:05,543 --> 00:40:07,045
What do you mean,
what's my point?

00:40:07,045 --> 00:40:09,614
My point is "Eater"
could still be out there.

00:40:09,614 --> 00:40:11,449
He never existed.
"Eater" is a myth.

00:40:11,449 --> 00:40:13,384
Todd Burris
was the cannibal.

00:40:13,384 --> 00:40:17,355
I understand that that's the
most likely explanation, Conrad,

00:40:17,355 --> 00:40:19,757
but until we find
physical evidence...

00:40:19,757 --> 00:40:23,494
D.B., the press release
already went out.

00:40:23,494 --> 00:40:27,465
Why would you do that?
What if we're wrong?

00:40:27,465 --> 00:40:30,702
Look, I get it, all right?
I've been in your shoes.

00:40:30,702 --> 00:40:32,003
World looks different
when you're sitting

00:40:32,003 --> 00:40:33,738
behind a microscope,
tweezing for

00:40:33,738 --> 00:40:35,907
any split hair of doubt...
That's the job!

00:40:35,907 --> 00:40:37,876
Well, my job now
is to make the people

00:40:37,876 --> 00:40:39,777
in this city feel safe.

00:40:39,777 --> 00:40:42,780
All right? Not the ones
dabbling in some deviant corner,

00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:45,016
but the rest,
who are living their lives,

00:40:45,016 --> 00:40:47,785
going to work,
supporting their families.

00:40:47,785 --> 00:40:50,722
Sounds like you've
decided to run after all.

00:40:53,791 --> 00:40:55,593
Case is closed.

00:40:57,528 --> 00:40:59,397
NEWS ANCHOR:
<i>Police have identified</i>

00:40:59,397 --> 00:41:03,468
the man responsible for the
grisly crimes as Todd Burris,

00:41:03,468 --> 00:41:05,103
a Las Vegas security guard
who is now deceased.

00:41:05,103 --> 00:41:06,537
WOMAN:
Here you go.

00:41:06,537 --> 00:41:07,906
Thank you.
You're welcome.

00:41:07,906 --> 00:41:10,074
Been a long one.

00:41:10,074 --> 00:41:11,809
That's fine.
Thanks.

00:41:11,809 --> 00:41:14,012
...Sheriff Conrad Ecklie
thanked the city's residents

00:41:14,012 --> 00:41:15,980
for their help in apprehending
the perpetrator

00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:19,050
and bringing him to justice.

00:41:25,056 --> 00:41:27,392
Oh, sorry, sorry.
