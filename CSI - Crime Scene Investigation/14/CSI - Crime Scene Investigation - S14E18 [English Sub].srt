00:00:01,941 --> 00:00:03,777
(crickets chirping)

00:00:07,781 --> 00:00:10,950
(television playing
indistinctly)

00:00:16,256 --> 00:00:18,191
(laughter, conversation on TV)

00:00:31,871 --> 00:00:34,140
(TV playing indistinctly)

00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,042
(dog whimpers)

00:00:36,042 --> 00:00:38,111
(woman speaks quietly
to dog)

00:00:56,096 --> 00:00:58,631
(laughter and conversation
continues on TV)

00:01:15,782 --> 00:01:18,318
Mom, I'm tired.
Can we stop now?

00:01:18,318 --> 00:01:20,320
Just one more house.

00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,288
Then we'll go home
for dinner, okay?

00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:31,865
They're not home.

00:01:31,865 --> 00:01:33,099
Well, knock louder.

00:01:33,099 --> 00:01:34,567
The Conners bought
ten candy bars

00:01:34,567 --> 00:01:36,803
from you
last year.
(phone ringing)

00:01:36,803 --> 00:01:38,805
(knocking)

00:01:38,805 --> 00:01:39,806
Sharon.

00:01:39,806 --> 00:01:41,341
How are you?
Yes.

00:01:41,341 --> 00:01:42,709
Yeah, we got back
last weekend.

00:01:42,709 --> 00:01:43,777
Sorry we missed
the party.

00:01:43,777 --> 00:01:45,745
Was he surprised?

00:01:47,147 --> 00:01:48,782
Oh!

00:01:48,782 --> 00:01:50,150
Wonderful. Amazing.

00:01:53,286 --> 00:01:54,621
Beautiful.

00:01:54,621 --> 00:01:56,589
Really, you need
to go with Burt.

00:01:57,991 --> 00:01:59,592
(groans weakly)

00:01:59,592 --> 00:02:03,596
(girl screams,
fades into police siren wailing)

00:02:06,866 --> 00:02:07,934
Was that our victim?

00:02:07,934 --> 00:02:09,936
Well, yes and no.

00:02:09,936 --> 00:02:11,571
His name is
Doug Adamson.

00:02:11,571 --> 00:02:14,974
He's, uh, 30 days out
of county lockup, right?

00:02:14,974 --> 00:02:16,042
Got a long rap sheet.

00:02:16,042 --> 00:02:17,977
Mostly drug use.

00:02:17,977 --> 00:02:19,112
Looks like he fell.

00:02:19,112 --> 00:02:20,647
<i>Knocked himself out.</i>

00:02:20,647 --> 00:02:21,748
RUSSELL:
<i>I assume we're not here</i>

00:02:21,748 --> 00:02:22,749
<i>'cause he hurt his head.</i>

00:02:22,749 --> 00:02:24,083
Oh, he didn't live here.

00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:26,052
This house belongs
to the Conner family.

00:02:26,052 --> 00:02:28,822
The neighbors said they haven't
seen them for almost a month.

00:02:28,822 --> 00:02:32,325
Ah. Well, whole families
just don't vanish.

00:02:32,325 --> 00:02:34,727
Well, we know it's
easier to find a
car than people,

00:02:34,727 --> 00:02:36,996
so I've got
a broadcast out
on their vehicles.

00:02:36,996 --> 00:02:39,699
What does Doug Adamson
have to say about all this?

00:02:39,699 --> 00:02:40,934
Well, nothing yet,

00:02:40,934 --> 00:02:42,669
but I'm going down
to the ER later.

00:02:42,669 --> 00:02:44,204
All right, so we've
got a convicted felon

00:02:44,204 --> 00:02:45,939
just out of jail
at the same time

00:02:45,939 --> 00:02:47,207
that a family disappears

00:02:47,207 --> 00:02:49,909
and we find him
inside their house--

00:02:49,909 --> 00:02:52,912
that does not look good
for Mr. Adamson.

00:02:52,912 --> 00:02:55,748
Looks even worse
for the Conner family.

00:03:02,655 --> 00:03:05,291

00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:08,628

00:03:31,618 --> 00:03:33,186
So a whole family is missing

00:03:33,186 --> 00:03:35,321
and no one reports it
to the police.

00:03:35,321 --> 00:03:36,789
Well, if I wasn't a CSI,

00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:38,024
I would think
they just moved out.

00:03:38,024 --> 00:03:39,626
No TV, no furniture,

00:03:39,626 --> 00:03:40,827
no electronics.

00:03:40,827 --> 00:03:42,695
Everything of value
is pretty much gone.

00:03:42,695 --> 00:03:45,098
Not if you include
sentimental value.

00:03:45,098 --> 00:03:48,334
Looks like they left behind
some of their family photos.

00:03:48,334 --> 00:03:50,270
FINLAY: Hard to believe
they would leave those.

00:03:52,105 --> 00:03:53,973
All right, so this is where
our intruder, Doug,

00:03:53,973 --> 00:03:55,975
hit his head and fell.

00:03:59,646 --> 00:04:01,781
I'll see if I can find
anything else here.

00:04:01,781 --> 00:04:03,116
I'm gonna take the outside.

00:04:03,116 --> 00:04:05,084
Carpet hasn't been
recently shampooed.

00:04:05,084 --> 00:04:06,886
That's good
for us.
STOKES:
Yeah.

00:04:06,886 --> 00:04:09,222
You know, each of these photos

00:04:09,222 --> 00:04:11,057
is a family member alone.

00:04:11,057 --> 00:04:12,191
Doing their own thing.

00:04:12,191 --> 00:04:13,126
Except for this one.

00:04:15,228 --> 00:04:19,565
Guess that's how families
are these days.

00:04:19,565 --> 00:04:22,001
Huh. Well, that's strange.

00:04:23,803 --> 00:04:25,705
This curtain's missing.

00:04:25,705 --> 00:04:27,774
Tieback too.

00:04:31,811 --> 00:04:34,113
2 millimeter
medium force spatter.

00:04:34,113 --> 00:04:35,682
From Doug Adamson's fall?

00:04:35,682 --> 00:04:37,116
Yeah, some of it.

00:04:37,116 --> 00:04:38,751
Okay, so...

00:04:38,751 --> 00:04:39,886
Doug fell here...

00:04:42,188 --> 00:04:44,223
<i>...causing spatter</i>
<i>to move upward,</i>

00:04:44,223 --> 00:04:45,325
<i>close to the floor.</i>

00:04:45,325 --> 00:04:47,727
Further away, over here,

00:04:47,727 --> 00:04:50,697
spatter is traveling downwards.

00:04:50,697 --> 00:04:52,265
Indicates a separate event.

00:04:52,265 --> 00:04:53,232
Exactly.

00:04:54,734 --> 00:04:56,970
Yeah, okay.

00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,304
Yeah, here we go.

00:04:58,304 --> 00:04:59,639
There's some spatter
on the fireplace,

00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:01,708
and on the wall as well.

00:05:03,943 --> 00:05:07,013
Nick, look at
the ceiling.

00:05:07,013 --> 00:05:08,114
Castoff.

00:05:08,114 --> 00:05:09,048
STOKES:
Ooh, yeah.

00:05:12,051 --> 00:05:13,920
All right, I'm gonna
luminol the place.
Okay.

00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,955
Do you mind stepping out
so that we both don't

00:05:15,955 --> 00:05:17,256
trample all over
the evidence?

00:05:17,256 --> 00:05:18,257
Seriously?

00:05:18,257 --> 00:05:20,326
Yeah.

00:05:24,097 --> 00:05:25,331
She kick you out?
Yeah!

00:05:25,331 --> 00:05:27,033
(both laughing)

00:05:29,302 --> 00:05:30,903
Hey, check this out.

00:05:30,903 --> 00:05:32,772
The caulk on
this window...

00:05:32,772 --> 00:05:35,575
it's fresh.

00:05:35,575 --> 00:05:38,644
STOKES: Yeah, and the other ones
are yellow and cracked.

00:05:38,644 --> 00:05:39,746
That means that somebody

00:05:39,746 --> 00:05:42,215
recently replaced that glass.

00:05:42,215 --> 00:05:43,950
All right.

00:05:48,221 --> 00:05:49,622
Hey, come take a look at this.

00:05:53,092 --> 00:05:55,094
Does that look like
blood to you?

00:05:55,094 --> 00:05:57,930
To the naked eye,
yes, it does.

00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:59,665
Soaked all the way
through the mat.

00:05:59,665 --> 00:06:01,067
It's hard to believe
someone would

00:06:01,067 --> 00:06:02,635
drag a dead body
out the front door.

00:06:02,635 --> 00:06:05,238
Even at night,
there's not much cover out here.

00:06:05,238 --> 00:06:08,574
But I bet they did
some cleaning up.

00:06:08,574 --> 00:06:11,144
Which means we're
getting dirty.

00:06:11,144 --> 00:06:13,679
Time to Dumpster dive.

00:06:13,679 --> 00:06:15,148
You're joining me, right?

00:06:15,148 --> 00:06:16,716
Yeah, um...
WOMAN:
Excuse me.

00:06:16,716 --> 00:06:18,117
Officer?

00:06:18,117 --> 00:06:19,719
Hi, there.

00:06:19,719 --> 00:06:20,753
What's your name?

00:06:20,753 --> 00:06:22,221
I'm Madge.

00:06:22,221 --> 00:06:23,856
I'm a neighbor.

00:06:23,856 --> 00:06:25,691
I'm Nick Stokes.
I'm with the Crime Lab.

00:06:25,691 --> 00:06:28,227
I was just wondering...
what happened to the Conners?

00:06:28,227 --> 00:06:29,862
Well, it's an ongoing
investigation,

00:06:29,862 --> 00:06:31,330
so I can't really
talk about it too much.

00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:33,232
Oh, I understand.

00:06:33,232 --> 00:06:34,333
Did you know them?

00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,969
Well, Dwight, the husband,

00:06:36,969 --> 00:06:40,106
he works 9:00 to 5:00,
a real go-getter.

00:06:40,106 --> 00:06:42,842
And Claire, she's a
lovely stay-at-home mom.

00:06:42,842 --> 00:06:45,011
Their son, I think
he graduated

00:06:45,011 --> 00:06:46,612
high school last year.

00:06:46,612 --> 00:06:49,215
I don't know much
about the daughter...

00:06:49,215 --> 00:06:51,851
but I haven't seen any of them
in the last few weeks.

00:06:51,851 --> 00:06:53,152
And in that time span,

00:06:53,152 --> 00:06:55,955
did you see anybody
hanging around the house?

00:06:55,955 --> 00:06:58,124
Just the man they took
away in the ambulance.

00:06:58,124 --> 00:06:59,725
You know,
he was working

00:06:59,725 --> 00:07:01,561
around the house
and living there.

00:07:01,561 --> 00:07:03,296
I thought he
was a relative.

00:07:03,296 --> 00:07:04,697
Hmm.

00:07:04,697 --> 00:07:06,165
Did you notice
anything else?

00:07:06,165 --> 00:07:08,167
Uh, yeah, there was
a great big truck,

00:07:08,167 --> 00:07:09,635
and they were
loading in all kinds

00:07:09,635 --> 00:07:11,104
of furniture.

00:07:11,104 --> 00:07:14,107
I thought the Conners were
remodeling or something.

00:07:14,107 --> 00:07:15,741
I'd be willing to bet

00:07:15,741 --> 00:07:18,044
that you saw something on
that truck to give it away,

00:07:18,044 --> 00:07:20,279
like a company name, logo,
anything like that?

00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:21,881
Yes, I did.

00:07:21,881 --> 00:07:23,082
It was, uh,

00:07:23,082 --> 00:07:25,818
Las Vegas Consignment.

00:07:25,818 --> 00:07:26,986
That's a big help.

00:07:26,986 --> 00:07:29,689
I would love
to live next-door to you.

00:07:29,689 --> 00:07:31,124
Oh, aren't you sweet?

00:07:34,727 --> 00:07:37,029
Hey, hey, that's all
the clothes I got!
Sorry.

00:07:37,029 --> 00:07:38,131
Gotta take them in for evidence.

00:07:38,131 --> 00:07:39,565
BRASS:
It's okay, Doug.

00:07:39,565 --> 00:07:40,967
Question and
answer time.
Do we have to?

00:07:40,967 --> 00:07:41,968
My head still hurts.

00:07:41,968 --> 00:07:43,236
You're fine.

00:07:43,236 --> 00:07:45,037
How'd you know
the Conner family?

00:07:45,037 --> 00:07:46,839
I was behind the mini-mart.
You know the one on 12th?

00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:48,574
What day was this?

00:07:48,574 --> 00:07:50,243
February 18.

00:07:50,243 --> 00:07:52,311
Oh, and that's the day you
were released from County.

00:07:52,311 --> 00:07:56,115
Yeah, same day.
Mm-hmm.

00:07:56,115 --> 00:07:57,650
Dude drives up
and asks me

00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:59,018
if I wanted to
earn some money.

00:07:59,018 --> 00:08:00,019
Had you seen
him before?

00:08:00,019 --> 00:08:01,554
No. Never.

00:08:01,554 --> 00:08:02,955
What kind of work
did he ask you to do?

00:08:02,955 --> 00:08:04,924
Just some odd jobs
around his house.

00:08:04,924 --> 00:08:07,793
Mm-hmm. Is this the guy
you spoke with?

00:08:07,793 --> 00:08:08,895
Not him.

00:08:08,895 --> 00:08:11,164
Him... and-and
she was with him.

00:08:11,164 --> 00:08:12,798
BRASS: Ethan Conner and
his mother Claire.

00:08:12,798 --> 00:08:14,267
Yeah.
I went with them,

00:08:14,267 --> 00:08:16,169
I cleaned their garage.
I didn't finish till late,

00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:17,770
so they let me
spend the night.

00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:19,038
Inside the house?
Yeah.

00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:21,107
The guest room.

00:08:21,107 --> 00:08:23,209
Sounds like nice people.

00:08:23,209 --> 00:08:24,544
Can I see your hands, please?

00:08:26,078 --> 00:08:27,313
Over.

00:08:29,315 --> 00:08:31,083
They're pretty thrashed.

00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:32,818
Hard work'll do that.

00:08:32,818 --> 00:08:35,054
Okay, so you spent the night.
Then what happened?

00:08:35,054 --> 00:08:36,622
Then, the next morning,
they asked me to dig

00:08:36,622 --> 00:08:37,857
some trenches
for the sprinklers.

00:08:37,857 --> 00:08:39,158
Some trenches?

00:08:39,158 --> 00:08:40,860
Yeah.

00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,162
What happened to
the Conners, Doug?

00:08:43,162 --> 00:08:44,664
No one's seen
them lately.

00:08:44,664 --> 00:08:45,865
In fact, you're
the last person

00:08:45,865 --> 00:08:46,966
to see them at all.

00:08:46,966 --> 00:08:48,701
I don't know.

00:08:48,701 --> 00:08:50,036
Okay?

00:08:50,036 --> 00:08:52,038
I was digging in the backyard,

00:08:52,038 --> 00:08:53,773
saw them get
into their car.

00:08:53,773 --> 00:08:54,807
What kind of car?

00:08:54,807 --> 00:08:57,109
A blue SUV.
Mm-hmm.

00:08:57,109 --> 00:08:58,811
They said they were
going to a movie,

00:08:58,811 --> 00:09:00,680
and they never came back.

00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,048
A movie.
Yeah.

00:09:02,048 --> 00:09:03,683
So you just kept
digging, even though

00:09:03,683 --> 00:09:05,151
you weren't
getting paid.
Yeah.

00:09:05,151 --> 00:09:06,919
They told me I could stay
as long as I wanted.

00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:08,955
SANDERS: For 30 days?
Didn't you ever get curious

00:09:08,955 --> 00:09:10,089
as to where they were?

00:09:10,089 --> 00:09:11,958
Yeah, but what was
I supposed to do?

00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:14,026
Call the cops?

00:09:14,026 --> 00:09:15,561
They'd take me back to jail.

00:09:15,561 --> 00:09:16,796
So whatever happened
to their furniture?

00:09:16,796 --> 00:09:17,830
The computers,

00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:19,732
TVs...

00:09:22,001 --> 00:09:24,604
Look, I-I waited
for them to come back.

00:09:24,604 --> 00:09:26,639
Really.

00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:28,074
Then after a week or two,

00:09:28,074 --> 00:09:30,876
I ran out of food,
so I sold some of the stuff,

00:09:30,876 --> 00:09:32,878
just enough to cover
what they owed me.

00:09:34,914 --> 00:09:37,617
Then-then I sold
some more stuff.

00:09:37,617 --> 00:09:39,185

to stay at their
house indefinitely.

00:09:43,022 --> 00:09:45,191
And then they
mysteriously vanish,

00:09:45,191 --> 00:09:47,627
leaving you to sell
off their property

00:09:47,627 --> 00:09:48,828
piece by piece,
for cash.

00:09:48,828 --> 00:09:50,630
Sounds hard to believe, right?

00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:51,864
It's ridiculous.

00:09:51,864 --> 00:09:54,133
When he gets discharged,

00:09:54,133 --> 00:09:55,201
bring him to the
police station.

00:09:55,201 --> 00:09:57,136

to clean him up.

More blood.

Okay.

00:10:42,848 --> 00:10:46,285
So the predominance
of blood is in this
main living area.

00:10:46,285 --> 00:10:48,721
I marked the voids
with chalk

00:10:48,721 --> 00:10:50,923
to determine
the furniture placement.

00:10:50,923 --> 00:10:53,759
Which was not very difficult
because this entire carpet

00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:55,161
is covered in blood.

00:10:55,161 --> 00:10:57,763
So I found
two interesting areas.

00:10:57,763 --> 00:11:00,266
Right here's
the most concentrated stain,

00:11:00,266 --> 00:11:02,034
About 2 feet in diameter.

00:11:02,034 --> 00:11:04,070
So somebody
was laying there bleeding.

00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,905
And the medium-force spatter

00:11:05,905 --> 00:11:07,306
that I found
on the wall tells me

00:11:07,306 --> 00:11:09,942
that the beating occurred
in this general area.

00:11:09,942 --> 00:11:14,146

the suspect here.

00:11:14,146 --> 00:11:15,614
But without the furniture,

00:11:15,614 --> 00:11:17,216
I really can't be
more specific.

Well, I think I can
help you out there.

00:11:19,218 --> 00:11:22,588

I'll see you later.
Bye.

00:11:29,862 --> 00:11:32,264
The most concerning evidence
I found is over here.

00:11:36,168 --> 00:11:37,203
Well...

00:11:37,203 --> 00:11:39,271
drag marks.

The end of the hall?

00:11:45,745 --> 00:11:47,947
A garage and backyard.

00:11:47,947 --> 00:11:52,051
Bloody drag marks mean
dead bodies to me.

00:11:52,051 --> 00:11:55,187
And anyone left alive who got
in the car with a killer...

00:11:55,187 --> 00:11:56,856
Probably dead too.

don't step on the chalk, okay?

00:12:06,265 --> 00:12:07,666
And the string.

00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:09,635
Really careful of the string.
Thank you.

00:12:09,635 --> 00:12:11,070
She's a very bossy lady.

all this down, huh?

Nick's still working on it.

Evidently,
Las Vegas Consignment

00:12:18,711 --> 00:12:20,780
keeps some pretty
shoddy records.

00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:23,716
And some of the folks didn't
want to give up their stuff.

00:12:23,716 --> 00:12:25,985
How did he charm them
into it?

00:12:25,985 --> 00:12:27,686
Showed them
the blood spatter.

00:12:27,686 --> 00:12:31,791
Nice. Okay, the end table

all the way
across the room,

which means that
the weapon was long.

00:13:21,974 --> 00:13:23,309
You know, earlier,
I noticed

that the poker from the fire set
is missing.

Point of origin is at

Nick said that he noticed
that one of the curtain tiebacks

00:14:09,788 --> 00:14:11,190
was missing.

00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:14,159
Yeah, maybe the victim

the gravitational drips down
the side of the stool here.

daughter Heather's
homeschooled.

00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:44,203
But when you look at his record,
two speeding tickets.

00:17:44,203 --> 00:17:46,705
The search of his room
is a different story.

00:17:46,705 --> 00:17:48,907
<i>Found some stash boxes</i>

00:17:48,907 --> 00:17:51,543
with traces of methamphetamine
and THC.

00:17:51,543 --> 00:17:54,012
Now, I think they're
Doug's, the homeless guy's.

00:17:54,012 --> 00:17:57,116
But if they're not...
you know,

00:17:57,116 --> 00:18:00,085
then maybe Ethan, maybe Ethan
got into some trouble

00:18:00,085 --> 00:18:02,121
with his sketchy friends.

00:18:02,121 --> 00:18:05,557
Enough trouble
to kill the whole family?

00:18:05,557 --> 00:18:06,892
No.
(phone chirps)

00:18:06,892 --> 00:18:07,860
Sorry. Brass.

00:18:10,863 --> 00:18:12,231
(knocking on door)

00:18:12,231 --> 00:18:13,665
Oh, yeah. Hey.

00:18:13,665 --> 00:18:15,067
Got your, uh, text.

00:18:15,067 --> 00:18:17,302
You have something for me
on Claire Conner?

00:18:17,302 --> 00:18:19,772
On February 1, Claire Conner
filed a police report.

00:18:19,772 --> 00:18:21,740
Uh, she claimed someone
was stalking her.

00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,542
Mostly minor vandalism.

00:18:23,542 --> 00:18:25,010
You know, they keyed her car,

00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:27,079
slashed her tires, threw
a rock through her window.

00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:29,782
That would explain the glass
being recently replaced.

00:18:29,782 --> 00:18:31,683
Yeah, well, on the same day
that she called it in,

00:18:31,683 --> 00:18:33,218
she left the house for an hour.

00:18:33,218 --> 00:18:35,888
She came home, all the cabinets
were left wide open.

00:18:35,888 --> 00:18:37,556
So somebody got in.

00:18:37,556 --> 00:18:39,591
Police officers
were dispatched.
They offered

00:18:39,591 --> 00:18:42,127
to send a CSI tech to print
the place, but she declined.

00:18:42,127 --> 00:18:45,330
That's interesting because
Henry just confirmed

00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:47,800
that the blood on their
front porch was canine.

00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:51,904
Their dog was killed
and displayed as a threat.

00:18:51,904 --> 00:18:53,305
She never reported that.

00:18:53,305 --> 00:18:54,940
That's a little odd.

00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:58,243
(phone rings)
Oh. Excuse me.

00:18:58,243 --> 00:18:59,978
Brass.

00:19:01,847 --> 00:19:04,750
Okay. Good work.

00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,820
So Dwight Conner worked
for Marvin Braxton

00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,021
of Braxton Imports.

00:19:09,021 --> 00:19:10,589
Coffee bean guy?

00:19:10,589 --> 00:19:12,925
Well, coffee and other
Colombian imports.

00:19:12,925 --> 00:19:14,226
Braxton fired Conner

00:19:14,226 --> 00:19:17,196
one day before
the family went missing.

00:19:17,196 --> 00:19:19,231
I'm bringing
him in now.

00:19:19,231 --> 00:19:21,867
Dwight Conner worked for me
for seven years.

00:19:21,867 --> 00:19:23,068
In what capacity?

00:19:23,068 --> 00:19:24,703
He was my CFO.

00:19:24,703 --> 00:19:26,772
Oh. Why'd you fire him?

00:19:26,772 --> 00:19:29,575
He stole from me--500 Gs.

00:19:29,575 --> 00:19:31,176
That's a lot of money.
Found out during

00:19:31,176 --> 00:19:33,212
a routine audit. Took the money
from the company account,

00:19:33,212 --> 00:19:34,580
put it into
his personal account.

00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,048
Didn't even try to hide it.

00:19:36,048 --> 00:19:38,550
That's not very smart
for a financial guy.

00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:40,285
He denies it, you know?
But you can check for yourself.

00:19:40,285 --> 00:19:42,321
It's in the account.

00:19:42,321 --> 00:19:43,822
Did you know
that the Conner family

00:19:43,822 --> 00:19:45,190
are officially missing persons?

00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:46,758
I've heard something about it.

00:19:46,758 --> 00:19:48,293
And are you aware
that they went missing

00:19:48,293 --> 00:19:51,563
one day after
you fired Dwight Conner?

00:19:51,563 --> 00:19:54,032
I am not aware of any dates.

00:19:54,032 --> 00:19:56,768
I just figured they ran off
with the money.

00:19:56,768 --> 00:19:58,604
Funny thing is
it's still in his account.

00:19:58,604 --> 00:20:00,172
My new guy checked.

00:20:00,172 --> 00:20:03,108
You know, we both know
that Braxton Imports launders

00:20:03,108 --> 00:20:05,711
more money than it earns.

00:20:05,711 --> 00:20:07,746
Those charges were dropped.

00:20:07,746 --> 00:20:10,048
This is a big money hit
for any business to absorb.

00:20:10,048 --> 00:20:12,284
I'll get the money back.

00:20:12,284 --> 00:20:13,986
I got my own way of doing it,

00:20:13,986 --> 00:20:16,655
and they don't involve going
after a family.

00:20:16,655 --> 00:20:19,224
We think the Conner family
met with foul play.

00:20:19,224 --> 00:20:21,627
You're talking murder now.

00:20:23,695 --> 00:20:25,097
(laughs)

00:20:27,332 --> 00:20:30,869
Uh-huh.
I have no idea about that.

00:20:30,869 --> 00:20:33,105
You can direct any other
questions to my lawyer.

00:20:37,009 --> 00:20:39,778
So this is
the son's car, huh?

00:20:39,778 --> 00:20:42,281
Yeah. Auto shop called
after the broadcast.

00:20:42,281 --> 00:20:43,815
Driver's side is
pretty banged up.

00:20:43,815 --> 00:20:45,217
Car's been in the shop
for a month.

00:20:45,217 --> 00:20:46,852
Obviously hasn't been
repaired yet.

00:20:46,852 --> 00:20:48,253
A month? You know,

00:20:48,253 --> 00:20:49,888
we keep running into this
four-week wall.

00:20:49,888 --> 00:20:51,290
It's like life just stopped

00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:53,825
for that entire family
in an instant.

00:20:53,825 --> 00:20:56,028
Yeah. The mechanic called
the Conners with the estimate.

00:20:56,028 --> 00:20:58,297
Never heard back,
so he put the car on hold.

00:20:58,297 --> 00:21:00,632
Hasn't touched it.
They know what happened?

00:21:00,632 --> 00:21:02,200
According to the DMV,

00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,337
Ethan Conner was involved
in an accident February 15.

00:21:05,337 --> 00:21:07,139
Claimed it was due
to brake failure.

00:21:07,139 --> 00:21:08,307
Take a look.

00:21:11,677 --> 00:21:13,545
The steel brake lines

00:21:13,545 --> 00:21:16,181
on this car have been
completely cut

00:21:16,181 --> 00:21:18,817
intentionally, front and back.

00:21:18,817 --> 00:21:21,119
Maybe it put him
in the hospital.

00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:24,823
I found a medical bracelet
belonging to Ethan in the car.

00:21:24,823 --> 00:21:25,824
It's from

00:21:25,824 --> 00:21:27,292
Desert Palm Hospital.

00:21:27,292 --> 00:21:30,295
Well, Brass is convinced
that the entire family

00:21:30,295 --> 00:21:32,764
is paying for the father
stealing dirty money.

00:21:32,764 --> 00:21:34,066
You know, maybe

00:21:34,066 --> 00:21:35,968
they were trying
to threaten the father

00:21:35,968 --> 00:21:37,302
by hurting the son,
you know what I mean?

00:21:37,302 --> 00:21:39,972
All Mob style.

00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,042
(sniffs)

00:21:44,042 --> 00:21:45,978
Ugh, you know, we're
not gonna be able to pull

00:21:45,978 --> 00:21:48,847
any definitive DNA references
from all of this trash.

00:21:48,847 --> 00:21:50,582
It's a waste of time.

00:21:50,582 --> 00:21:51,583
I disagree.

00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:52,985
I find garbage fascinating.

00:21:52,985 --> 00:21:54,086
Yeah, that doesn't surprise me.

00:21:54,086 --> 00:21:55,287
What most people throw away

00:21:55,287 --> 00:21:56,588
in trash bags is actually

00:21:56,588 --> 00:21:58,623
biodegradable or recyclable.

00:21:58,623 --> 00:22:00,659
Unnecessarily taking up
the precious space

00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:02,728
in our rapidly
diminishing landfills.

00:22:02,728 --> 00:22:05,163
Hey, don't look at me.
I recycle.

00:22:05,163 --> 00:22:08,000
I've started

00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,870
recording my garbage
in a trash journal.

00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:15,607
So now I discard no more
than 3 pounds per week.

00:22:15,607 --> 00:22:17,175
You have a trash journal?

00:22:17,175 --> 00:22:18,643
Yeah.

00:22:19,811 --> 00:22:21,279
This looks like a contract

00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:22,614
for a storage unit.

00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:27,185
"Maybrook Storage."

00:22:27,185 --> 00:22:30,022
Rented to "Doug Adamson"?

00:22:30,022 --> 00:22:31,923
February 19, 2014.

00:22:31,923 --> 00:22:35,093
It's the morning after he had
a sleepover at the Conner house.

00:22:35,093 --> 00:22:37,295
"Unit 353."

00:22:37,295 --> 00:22:40,132
Why would Doug Adamson
need a storage unit?

00:22:42,868 --> 00:22:44,636
"353."

00:22:49,241 --> 00:22:51,243
Ugh...

00:22:51,243 --> 00:22:53,211
Hard to mistake that smell.

00:23:06,992 --> 00:23:08,927
FINLAY:
There's a lot of blood.

00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,175
Inside is empty.

00:23:25,777 --> 00:23:27,579
Keys are still in the ignition.

00:23:27,579 --> 00:23:29,314
(car door shuts)

00:23:32,117 --> 00:23:33,051
Finn.

00:23:39,224 --> 00:23:40,826
Dwight Conner.

00:23:42,761 --> 00:23:45,797
Where's the rest
of the Conner family?

00:23:50,936 --> 00:23:53,171
(distant siren wailing)

00:23:56,041 --> 00:23:57,809
I.D. confirms that

00:23:57,809 --> 00:23:58,910
this is the dad--

00:23:58,910 --> 00:23:59,945
Dwight Conner.

00:23:59,945 --> 00:24:01,279
Large volume of blood

00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:02,981
tells us that
he was killed here.

00:24:02,981 --> 00:24:05,650
Based on the castoff,

00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:07,853
he was struck multiple times.

00:24:09,087 --> 00:24:10,856
No kidding.

00:24:10,856 --> 00:24:13,058
Mr. Conner's skull is in,
like, a million pieces.

00:24:15,894 --> 00:24:18,997
There are bone fragments
embedded in the wood.

00:24:18,997 --> 00:24:20,932
Doug must've been really angry.

00:24:23,235 --> 00:24:24,569
(grunts)

00:24:26,204 --> 00:24:28,874
♪ ♪

00:24:46,791 --> 00:24:48,894
Confirmed blood in the trunk.

00:24:48,894 --> 00:24:51,129
Did you find any blood
in the rest of the car?

00:24:51,129 --> 00:24:52,964
Not a drop.
Hmm.

00:24:54,666 --> 00:24:56,635
DNA match.

00:24:56,635 --> 00:24:58,904
Blood in the house,
female donor.

00:24:58,904 --> 00:25:00,138
(sighs heavily)

00:25:01,907 --> 00:25:05,577
Okay, so either Claire
or Heather Conner

00:25:05,577 --> 00:25:07,212
is killed at the house,

00:25:07,212 --> 00:25:10,549
then put into the trunk
of the car,

00:25:10,549 --> 00:25:12,617
the body dumped somewhere.

00:25:12,617 --> 00:25:14,686
Then Mr. Conner
was driven here

00:25:14,686 --> 00:25:16,922
to this storage unit,
where he was killed.

00:25:16,922 --> 00:25:18,223
That means that Dwight Conner

00:25:18,223 --> 00:25:19,791
was with the killer
when he got rid

00:25:19,791 --> 00:25:20,825
of the body in the trunk.

00:25:20,825 --> 00:25:23,929
Dead weight is heavy.

00:25:23,929 --> 00:25:26,665
Maybe the killer needed
Conner's help.

00:25:29,968 --> 00:25:33,705
BRODY: Looks like there's tar on
the passenger side of the car.

00:25:33,705 --> 00:25:35,840
They must've picked it up

00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,876
around the time
Mr. Conner was killed.

00:25:40,178 --> 00:25:42,681
Means the car was driven
over a freshly paved road.

00:25:44,015 --> 00:25:45,217
Find the road, maybe we'll find

00:25:45,217 --> 00:25:47,252
the rest of the Conner family.

00:25:47,252 --> 00:25:48,787
How many times do
I have to tell you?

00:25:48,787 --> 00:25:50,922
I never rented
any storage locker.

00:25:50,922 --> 00:25:52,224
How else do you explain

00:25:52,224 --> 00:25:54,125
these photos, Doug?
They were taken

00:25:54,125 --> 00:25:56,695
at Maybrook Storage
at 9:35 a.m.

00:25:56,695 --> 00:25:58,630
The same day the Conner family
went missing.

00:25:58,630 --> 00:25:59,898
I was digging trenches
in the Conner's yard

00:25:59,898 --> 00:26:01,633
that whole morning.

00:26:01,633 --> 00:26:02,767
That is not me.

00:26:02,767 --> 00:26:04,636
The shirt you're
wearing in the photo

00:26:04,636 --> 00:26:06,771
is the same one I collected
from you at the hospital.

00:26:06,771 --> 00:26:09,674
I can't be the only guy in
the world who likes plaid, man.

00:26:09,674 --> 00:26:12,077
Dwight Conner was found dead

00:26:12,077 --> 00:26:14,846
in a storage locker
that you rented.

00:26:14,846 --> 00:26:17,048
With his head bashed in
by a baseball bat.

00:26:17,048 --> 00:26:20,919
Conner's wife, Claire, and
their two children are missing.

00:26:20,919 --> 00:26:23,955
Blood is spattered
all over their house,

00:26:23,955 --> 00:26:26,658
the same house you
were squatting in.

00:26:26,658 --> 00:26:29,794
Look, I told you, they
invited me to live with them.

00:26:29,794 --> 00:26:31,930
(door opens)
BRASS:
Okay, Doug, so you're telling me

00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:33,765
that you never saw any
of the Conner family before?

00:26:33,765 --> 00:26:35,267
That's what I keep telling you.

00:26:35,267 --> 00:26:37,302
You're lying, Doug.

00:26:37,302 --> 00:26:40,705
You and Ethan Conner were
on a 72-hour psych hold

00:26:40,705 --> 00:26:42,307
in the same facility
on the same day.

00:26:42,307 --> 00:26:43,908
January 13.

00:26:43,908 --> 00:26:45,844
He was there for an O.D.
You were for medical detox.

00:26:45,844 --> 00:26:48,179
So?
So, there's only
ten people in the unit!

00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:49,781
You're telling me
you never even saw the guy?

00:26:49,781 --> 00:26:51,549
Nope.
So it's just a coincidence

00:26:51,549 --> 00:26:54,052
that Ethan offered you
a job at their house

00:26:54,052 --> 00:26:55,954
and his whole family
may be dead?

00:26:55,954 --> 00:26:59,557
Look, I'm not saying
I'm a saint.

00:26:59,557 --> 00:27:01,760
Okay? I've been an addict
since I was 13.

00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,095
Alcohol, coke, meth,
you name it.

00:27:04,095 --> 00:27:06,998
But I have never hurt anybody.

00:27:06,998 --> 00:27:10,802
Admit it--you'll do anything
to feed your habit.

00:27:10,802 --> 00:27:11,736
Even kill.

00:27:17,575 --> 00:27:18,943
If we charge you
for this crime,

00:27:18,943 --> 00:27:20,845
you're looking at murder.

00:27:20,845 --> 00:27:22,614
You know what that means?

00:27:22,614 --> 00:27:25,083
So do yourself a favor.

00:27:25,083 --> 00:27:28,053
Tell us where the rest
of the Conner family is,

00:27:28,053 --> 00:27:30,155
and maybe we can cut a deal.

00:27:30,155 --> 00:27:32,090
I'm done talking.

00:27:33,692 --> 00:27:34,959
I want a lawyer.

00:27:41,266 --> 00:27:45,303
Okay, so I've got some
DNA results here for you.

00:27:45,303 --> 00:27:47,906
The unknown male DNA
we found in the house

00:27:47,906 --> 00:27:49,941
is a match to Mr. Conner here.

00:27:49,941 --> 00:27:51,309
So he was injured there,

00:27:51,309 --> 00:27:54,713
and then killed in the--
in the storage unit.

00:27:54,713 --> 00:27:56,214
And then Henry compared
Mr. Conner's DNA

00:27:56,214 --> 00:27:58,650
against the unknown
female blood.

00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:00,085
There were no markers in common.

00:28:00,085 --> 00:28:03,855
She they're definitely
not related in any way.

00:28:03,855 --> 00:28:07,025
So it wasn't the daughter
that was killed in the house.

00:28:07,025 --> 00:28:08,226
It was the wife,

00:28:08,226 --> 00:28:09,861
which is interesting.

00:28:09,861 --> 00:28:11,229
Conner here was fired

00:28:11,229 --> 00:28:13,698
by his boss Braxton
for embezzling, right?

00:28:13,698 --> 00:28:17,335
Brass confirmed that it was
a lump sum electronic deposit

00:28:17,335 --> 00:28:20,171
of a half-million dollars.
So what if--

00:28:20,171 --> 00:28:22,807
what if Braxton
or one of his goons

00:28:22,807 --> 00:28:24,309
forced Dwight here

00:28:24,309 --> 00:28:27,245
to watch his loved
ones being murdered

00:28:27,245 --> 00:28:29,047
before he himself
was beaten to death?

00:28:29,047 --> 00:28:30,248
Except we still haven't found

00:28:30,248 --> 00:28:32,684
a link between Braxton and Doug.

00:28:32,684 --> 00:28:34,753
We do know
that Doug knew Ethan.

00:28:34,753 --> 00:28:36,654
They were both addicts.

00:28:36,654 --> 00:28:39,924
Maybe this was some kind
of drug deal gone wrong.

00:28:39,924 --> 00:28:41,092
And the family is just

00:28:41,092 --> 00:28:42,660
collateral damage.

00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:45,563
Boy, beautiful wife,

00:28:45,563 --> 00:28:46,865
two kids, a dog.

00:28:46,865 --> 00:28:48,333
<i>I mean, I bet they seemed like</i>

00:28:48,333 --> 00:28:51,236
the perfect American family.

00:28:51,236 --> 00:28:52,904
Nothing's ever
what it seems, is it?

00:28:52,904 --> 00:28:54,806
No, it's not.

00:28:58,843 --> 00:29:00,812
So did you, uh--

00:29:00,812 --> 00:29:02,747
did you already make a note
on the trace on these pants?

00:29:02,747 --> 00:29:04,849
The reddish dust?
I figured it was

00:29:04,849 --> 00:29:06,718
soil or crushed brick.

00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,822
It's embedded in the tread
of his shoe as well.

00:29:10,822 --> 00:29:13,658
You know, if the killer used
Dwight to help dispose

00:29:13,658 --> 00:29:15,794
of the other bodies,
he could've picked

00:29:15,794 --> 00:29:17,796
that stuff up from
where they were buried.

00:29:19,297 --> 00:29:22,934
Are you familiar
with the Mesozoic Era?

00:29:22,934 --> 00:29:24,035
The Age of Reptiles?

00:29:24,035 --> 00:29:25,036
Ah, I see
someone paid attention

00:29:25,036 --> 00:29:26,304
during earth science class.

00:29:26,304 --> 00:29:28,173
The Mesozoic Era was

00:29:28,173 --> 00:29:30,141
250 million years ago,
during a time

00:29:30,141 --> 00:29:32,277
in which Nevada's landscape

00:29:32,277 --> 00:29:35,180
was developing formations
of salt and gypsum.

00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:37,816
As the years passed,
oxidization gave

00:29:37,816 --> 00:29:40,685
these formations
a beautiful crimson hue,

00:29:40,685 --> 00:29:43,288
creating what we now know
as Red Rock Canyon.

00:29:43,288 --> 00:29:44,689
The red powder that Nick found

00:29:44,689 --> 00:29:46,791
on Mr. Conner's pants and shoes.

00:29:46,791 --> 00:29:47,892
Secluded.

00:29:47,892 --> 00:29:49,194
A perfect place for a killer

00:29:49,194 --> 00:29:50,762
to bury the rest of the family.

00:29:50,762 --> 00:29:54,199
Still, that's over
100,000 acres.

00:29:54,199 --> 00:29:56,668
Actually, over 200,000.

00:29:56,668 --> 00:29:57,902
Right.

00:29:57,902 --> 00:29:59,771
You know, I did find some tar

00:29:59,771 --> 00:30:02,040
on the passenger side
of the SUV.

00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:05,610
Means the killer drove
over a freshly paved road.

00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:06,911
So, we're looking
for an area of Red Rock

00:30:06,911 --> 00:30:08,880
near a road that was paved
about a month ago.

00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,248
Yeah.

00:30:10,248 --> 00:30:11,850
Good.

00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:13,084
Hey, it's Brody.

00:30:13,084 --> 00:30:14,786
(quietly):
Thanks.

00:30:14,786 --> 00:30:16,955

Yeah, okay, let's start digging.

00:31:05,103 --> 00:31:07,272
Okay, everybody,
let's bring it in!

00:31:07,272 --> 00:31:08,239

Found some kind of fabric.

00:31:31,896 --> 00:31:33,898
That's the missing curtain

00:31:33,898 --> 00:31:34,832
from the Conner house.

00:31:36,568 --> 00:31:38,803
Okay.

00:31:46,778 --> 00:31:48,580
Definitely female.

00:31:50,014 --> 00:31:51,950
STOKES:
Badly mummified.

00:31:53,718 --> 00:31:56,020
You think it's Mrs. Conner?

00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,589
Yeah, either that
or her daughter.

00:31:58,656 --> 00:32:00,024
(sighs)

00:32:07,165 --> 00:32:08,833
Hey.
Hey, Finn.

00:32:08,833 --> 00:32:10,802
So Nick and Morgan
are still out there,

00:32:10,802 --> 00:32:12,337
but they haven't found
any other bodies.

00:32:12,337 --> 00:32:14,639
I'm just finishing up
with our victim here.

00:32:14,639 --> 00:32:17,075
FINLAY:
Ligature marks on her wrist

00:32:17,075 --> 00:32:18,710
confirms she was restrained.

00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:20,745
Multiple contusions
to the head as well.

00:32:20,745 --> 00:32:21,946
Was that the cause of death?

00:32:21,946 --> 00:32:23,748
Subarachnoid hemorrhage

00:32:23,748 --> 00:32:26,084
caused by blunt-force trauma.

00:32:26,084 --> 00:32:29,020
The weapon cracked the skull,
but it didn't perforate it.

00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:31,756
Suggests that the killer didn't
have much upper-body strength.

00:32:31,756 --> 00:32:33,291
Were you able to narrow down

00:32:33,291 --> 00:32:35,026
what the weapon was?
Something heavy.

00:32:35,026 --> 00:32:36,995
An inch or less in diameter.

00:32:36,995 --> 00:32:38,863
Could it have been
a fireplace poker?

00:32:38,863 --> 00:32:40,999
That's consistent
with her injuries.

00:32:40,999 --> 00:32:42,567
There was one missing
from the house.

00:32:42,567 --> 00:32:43,568
(door opens, closes)

00:32:43,568 --> 00:32:45,703
The victim's X-rays.

00:32:48,606 --> 00:32:50,108
FINLAY:
Is that an IUD?

00:32:50,108 --> 00:32:52,310
ROBBINS: I did remove
an intrauterine device

00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:54,178
during autopsy.

00:32:54,178 --> 00:32:56,314
According
to their medical records,

00:32:56,314 --> 00:32:59,617
Claire Conner had a hysterectomy
five years ago.

00:32:59,617 --> 00:33:02,053
That means
this is not Claire Conner.

00:33:04,188 --> 00:33:07,759
And Heather was never
prescribed birth control.

00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:09,327
So it's not the daughter
either.

00:33:11,329 --> 00:33:13,631
Who is this woman?

00:33:18,136 --> 00:33:19,337
Hey.
Hmm?

00:33:19,337 --> 00:33:21,639
You know the great thing
about IUDs?

00:33:21,639 --> 00:33:22,840
Besides the obvious?

00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,309
They have serial numbers.

00:33:25,309 --> 00:33:28,579
Meet Jessica Fenton,

00:33:28,579 --> 00:33:30,782
our mystery woman
buried in Red Rock.

00:33:30,782 --> 00:33:33,818
Her DNA matched
the female blood in the house.

00:33:33,818 --> 00:33:35,620
Well, that's interesting.

00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:39,123
So Ms. Fenton here was killed
at the Conner house,

00:33:39,123 --> 00:33:41,292
then put in the back
of their SUV,

00:33:41,292 --> 00:33:42,727
driven out to Red Rock,

00:33:42,727 --> 00:33:44,796
and buried.
Do we know why?

00:33:44,796 --> 00:33:46,264
I mean, what's the connection
to the family?

00:33:46,264 --> 00:33:47,899
Well, I'm working on that.

00:33:47,899 --> 00:33:50,668
She was an IT specialist,
worked from home.

00:33:50,668 --> 00:33:53,104
Landlord reported her missing
when she didn't pay her rent.

00:33:53,104 --> 00:33:54,572
Nick just recovered her laptop,

00:33:54,572 --> 00:33:57,041
so he's going through it
right now.

00:33:57,041 --> 00:33:59,944
(passionate breathing,
laughter)

00:34:01,012 --> 00:34:03,815
(sighs)

00:34:03,815 --> 00:34:05,983
Is that Dwight Conner
in a sex tape?

00:34:05,983 --> 00:34:07,785
Oh, yeah, but not with his wife.

00:34:07,785 --> 00:34:09,921
This was taken
three months ago.

00:34:09,921 --> 00:34:11,789
Looks like
he and our victim

00:34:11,789 --> 00:34:14,959
from the Red Rock were, uh,
having a little fun on the side.

00:34:14,959 --> 00:34:16,627
She's totally playing it
to the camera.

00:34:16,627 --> 00:34:18,329
Oh, yeah, but I
don't even think

00:34:18,329 --> 00:34:20,131
he knows it's there.

00:34:20,131 --> 00:34:22,100
And check this out.

00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,601
Jessica Fenton's hard drive

00:34:23,601 --> 00:34:25,336
was filled with hundreds
of these photos.

00:34:25,336 --> 00:34:29,607
All of Conner and
his wife and kids.

00:34:29,607 --> 00:34:31,542
Claire Conner was right--

00:34:31,542 --> 00:34:33,111
someone was stalking
their family.

00:34:33,111 --> 00:34:34,679
Yeah, but it all happened
pretty fast.

00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:37,849
I mean, the affair
happened in December.

00:34:37,849 --> 00:34:39,183
And then a few weeks later,

00:34:39,183 --> 00:34:40,985
she goes
all <i>Fatal Attraction</i> on him,

00:34:40,985 --> 00:34:42,787
breaks into his house,

00:34:42,787 --> 00:34:47,859
and then kills the family pet
after treating it like that.

00:34:47,859 --> 00:34:49,961
And that's cold-blooded.
Well, she also tried

00:34:49,961 --> 00:34:51,229
to kill their son.

00:34:51,229 --> 00:34:53,698
I found diagonal cutters
at her house.

00:34:53,698 --> 00:34:57,802
Liquid on the hinge smells
and looks like brake fluid.

00:34:57,802 --> 00:34:59,971
Okay, all this time,
we have been thinking

00:34:59,971 --> 00:35:02,206
that this entire family is dead.

00:35:02,206 --> 00:35:03,708
Maybe we're wrong.

00:35:03,708 --> 00:35:06,677
The cheating husband,
the mistress--both dead--

00:35:06,677 --> 00:35:10,047
but who's the most
obvious suspect right now?

00:35:10,047 --> 00:35:11,249
Claire Conner. I mean,

00:35:11,249 --> 00:35:12,817
if she found out
about the affair,

00:35:12,817 --> 00:35:14,018
she could've killed them both.

00:35:14,018 --> 00:35:15,052
STOKES:
Yeah, and then what?

00:35:15,052 --> 00:35:17,088
Just grabs her kids and...

00:35:17,088 --> 00:35:18,756
gets the hell out of Dodge?

00:35:21,025 --> 00:35:22,593
BRASS:
<i>I gotta say,</i>

00:35:22,593 --> 00:35:24,862
Dwight Conner picked the
wrong woman to mess with

00:35:24,862 --> 00:35:26,264
with Jessica Fenton.

00:35:26,264 --> 00:35:28,065
She used her computer skills
to hack

00:35:28,065 --> 00:35:29,300
into the company server

00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,835
and then transferred
half a million bucks

00:35:30,835 --> 00:35:32,737
into his private bank account.

00:35:32,737 --> 00:35:34,205
She got him fired.

00:35:34,205 --> 00:35:36,073
Yeah.
Yeah, and as if
that wasn't enough,

00:35:36,073 --> 00:35:38,609
Nick found evidence
that she contacted the wife

00:35:38,609 --> 00:35:40,044
and gave her the sex tape.

00:35:40,044 --> 00:35:41,846
RUSSELL:
Proving that Claire Conner

00:35:41,846 --> 00:35:42,980
knew about the affair.

00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,081
Yeah, and she also knew

00:35:44,081 --> 00:35:45,183
who was threatening her family.

00:35:45,183 --> 00:35:46,818
Nick also found an email

00:35:46,818 --> 00:35:49,787
from Claire to Ms. Fenton
on February 18

00:35:49,787 --> 00:35:51,222
saying, "We need to talk."

00:35:51,222 --> 00:35:54,292
That was one day before
the family went missing.

00:35:54,292 --> 00:35:55,927
Which explains
why Jessica Fenton

00:35:55,927 --> 00:35:57,862
was at the Conner house
in the first place.

00:35:57,862 --> 00:35:59,297
Okay, so...

00:35:59,297 --> 00:36:02,133
Claire Conner confronts
her husband's mistress.

00:36:02,133 --> 00:36:03,734
Mm-hmm.
Things escalate.

00:36:03,734 --> 00:36:05,136
Claire hits her.

00:36:05,136 --> 00:36:06,971
Jessica falls down.

00:36:06,971 --> 00:36:09,140
(panting)

00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:11,042
Do you like the tape I made
with your husband?

00:36:11,042 --> 00:36:12,677
RUSSELL: <i>Obviously,</i>
<i>the rest of the conversation</i>

00:36:12,677 --> 00:36:13,945
<i>did not go very well.</i>

00:36:13,945 --> 00:36:15,947
Get off me!

00:36:18,683 --> 00:36:20,084
(screaming)

00:36:20,084 --> 00:36:21,919
And we also know
that Dwight Conner's blood

00:36:21,919 --> 00:36:23,855
was found at the scene,
so at some point,

00:36:23,855 --> 00:36:26,090
he came in there
to try to intervene.

00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:27,992
What the hell are you doing?
Stop!

00:36:27,992 --> 00:36:29,560
CLAIRE:
Give me it.

00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,963
No!
(groans)

00:36:31,963 --> 00:36:35,233
So now Claire and Dwight Conner

00:36:35,233 --> 00:36:37,602
have a body
in their living room.

00:36:37,602 --> 00:36:39,971
Okay, they have two options:
they can call the cops

00:36:39,971 --> 00:36:41,839
or cover it up.

00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:43,708
They chose the latter.

00:36:43,708 --> 00:36:46,043
They wrapped her in a curtain,
put her in the back of a car,

00:36:46,043 --> 00:36:48,145
and buried her out at Red Rock.

00:36:48,145 --> 00:36:49,914
And they drove
to the storage place,

00:36:49,914 --> 00:36:52,216
where Claire Conner
killed her husband.

00:36:52,216 --> 00:36:54,719
Okay, that all
makes sense, right?

00:36:57,321 --> 00:36:59,991
Except for the storage locker.

00:36:59,991 --> 00:37:02,159
I mean, we know
that Doug Adamson rented it.

00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:04,262
We got him on surveillance.

00:37:04,262 --> 00:37:06,831
So how's he fit
into all of this?

00:37:06,831 --> 00:37:08,566
Someone set him up.

00:37:08,566 --> 00:37:10,668
It's a strong possibility
that the person on that tape

00:37:10,668 --> 00:37:12,236
was not Doug but someone
that looked like him.

00:37:12,236 --> 00:37:14,138
There's no physical evidence
that he was there.

00:37:14,138 --> 00:37:15,339
Okay.

00:37:15,339 --> 00:37:16,674
Any evidence of the wife?

00:37:16,674 --> 00:37:18,209
No. No DNA from her either.

00:37:18,209 --> 00:37:20,845
Well, so then what are you
so excited about, Henry?

00:37:20,845 --> 00:37:22,179
Dwight Conner
fought his attacker.

00:37:22,179 --> 00:37:23,781
I found tissue under his nails.

00:37:23,781 --> 00:37:25,082
And you have the DNA results?

00:37:25,082 --> 00:37:28,085
Y-STRs match Mr. Conner.

00:37:28,085 --> 00:37:30,054
A male relative?

00:37:30,054 --> 00:37:31,889
So Dwight Conner was killed

00:37:31,889 --> 00:37:32,990
by his son

00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:34,091
in the storage unit.

00:37:34,091 --> 00:37:35,559
And I think I know why.

00:37:35,559 --> 00:37:37,228
I found evidence
of sexual activity

00:37:37,228 --> 00:37:39,163
on Jessica Fenton's underwear.

00:37:39,163 --> 00:37:42,833
It was an admixture of her DNA
and that same male profile.

00:37:42,833 --> 00:37:44,802
Uh, all right.

00:37:44,802 --> 00:37:46,804
So the son,

00:37:46,804 --> 00:37:47,805
<i>Ethan,</i>

00:37:47,805 --> 00:37:48,906
was having an affair

00:37:48,906 --> 00:37:50,341
with his father's mistress.

00:37:50,341 --> 00:37:52,543
You said Jessica Fenton
was trying

00:37:52,543 --> 00:37:55,179
to destroy Dwight Conner's
family--maybe, maybe

00:37:55,179 --> 00:37:56,981
seducing the son
was part of that plan.

00:37:56,981 --> 00:38:00,051
Right. Ethan finds out
that she's just using him,

00:38:00,051 --> 00:38:01,752
maybe even tried to kill him.

00:38:01,752 --> 00:38:02,987
He takes his rage out

00:38:02,987 --> 00:38:05,890
on his father.

00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:08,159
And now he and his mother
and his sister

00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:09,627
are in the wind.

00:38:09,627 --> 00:38:10,761
BRODY:
Russell?

00:38:10,761 --> 00:38:12,196
Yeah.
You have a minute?

00:38:12,196 --> 00:38:15,666
So I traced the
mistress's credit cards.

00:38:15,666 --> 00:38:17,101
Around the time
she was murdered,

00:38:17,101 --> 00:38:19,303
one of them was used
to buy three bus tickets

00:38:19,303 --> 00:38:21,005
to Prescott, Arizona.

00:38:21,005 --> 00:38:23,574
Claire Conner
and her two kids, right?

00:38:23,574 --> 00:38:25,810
Right. Next day, same card
was used to book a room

00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:27,011
at an extended stay hotel.

00:38:27,011 --> 00:38:28,813
Hasn't been used since.

00:38:28,813 --> 00:38:30,681
Are they still there?

00:38:30,681 --> 00:38:32,750
Brass contacted Prescott PD,
but when they got to the room,

00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:34,618
the only one there was Heather,
the daughter.

00:38:34,618 --> 00:38:36,887
The daughter?
Yeah.

00:38:41,859 --> 00:38:44,261
I haven't seen Mom or Ethan
in two weeks.

00:38:44,261 --> 00:38:46,063
Why didn't you call the police?

00:38:46,063 --> 00:38:47,798
I didn't want
to get them in trouble.

00:38:47,798 --> 00:38:49,567
Well, I mean, they're
already in trouble.

00:38:49,567 --> 00:38:50,768
Your mother killed
Jessica Fenton.

00:38:52,603 --> 00:38:54,772
Your brother k-killed your...

00:38:54,772 --> 00:38:56,007
My father.

00:38:56,007 --> 00:38:59,210
I know.

00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:01,278
Were you in the house when
Jessica Fenton was murdered?

00:39:01,278 --> 00:39:02,613
No.

00:39:02,613 --> 00:39:04,315
No, I just came home,

00:39:04,315 --> 00:39:05,983
and I saw that...

00:39:05,983 --> 00:39:08,152
she was lying there,

00:39:08,152 --> 00:39:09,987
dead.

00:39:09,987 --> 00:39:12,990
And there was blood
all over the floor.

00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:14,959
ETHAN: What did you do?
(screams)

00:39:14,959 --> 00:39:17,028
What were you thinking, Mom?

00:39:17,028 --> 00:39:18,696
CLAIRE:
You don't understand.

00:39:18,696 --> 00:39:20,064
She was never gonna stop.

00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:21,165
Who is she?
Ask your father.

00:39:21,165 --> 00:39:22,800
This is all his fault.

00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,135
We have to call the police.
No, no, no, no.

00:39:24,135 --> 00:39:25,269
No one's calling
the police, honey.

00:39:25,269 --> 00:39:26,871
Dad, we have to!

00:39:26,871 --> 00:39:28,773
Look, here's what
we're gonna do.

00:39:28,773 --> 00:39:30,307
We're gonna clean this up,
and we're gonna disappear

00:39:30,307 --> 00:39:31,275
as a family.

00:39:31,275 --> 00:39:32,877
It's okay.

00:39:32,877 --> 00:39:35,212
Nobody ever asks me what I want.

00:39:35,212 --> 00:39:36,947
People just make decisions
in my life,

00:39:36,947 --> 00:39:38,282
and I get no say.

00:39:38,282 --> 00:39:40,317
And now,
because of my parents,

00:39:40,317 --> 00:39:42,720
I don't ever get to see
my friends again.

00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,889
What about your brother?

00:39:44,889 --> 00:39:47,024
He was part of the plan.

00:39:47,024 --> 00:39:50,227
And how did he track down
that vagrant, Doug?

00:39:52,296 --> 00:39:54,298
Ethan remembered him
from the mini-mart.

00:39:54,298 --> 00:39:55,833
(sniffles)

00:39:55,833 --> 00:39:57,568
He said every morning
he would be there,

00:39:57,568 --> 00:39:59,070
looking through
the Dumpsters for food.

00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:00,104
We found him right away.

00:40:00,104 --> 00:40:01,338
And your mother and brother

00:40:01,338 --> 00:40:03,107
invited him to stay
at the house?

00:40:03,107 --> 00:40:06,644
Dad thought it was better if...

00:40:06,644 --> 00:40:08,712
people thought we were dead.

00:40:08,712 --> 00:40:10,648
You find some weird homeless guy
living there,

00:40:10,648 --> 00:40:12,917
and everybody would think
that he killed us.

00:40:12,917 --> 00:40:14,685
(grunts)

00:40:14,685 --> 00:40:17,555
Boy, your dad thought
he had it all figured out, huh?

00:40:17,555 --> 00:40:19,090
My dad and Ethan went
to drop off the car,

00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:22,760
but only Ethan came back
and met us at the bus station.

00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,595
He had blood on him.

00:40:24,595 --> 00:40:27,098
When you saw the blood,
did you ask him what happened?

00:40:27,098 --> 00:40:28,799
No.

00:40:28,799 --> 00:40:30,634
He just said we were better off
without Dad.

00:40:32,203 --> 00:40:35,339
Honestly,
none of this would have happened

00:40:35,339 --> 00:40:37,708
if he had just kept it
in his pants.

00:40:37,708 --> 00:40:41,112
(sighs)

00:40:41,112 --> 00:40:44,715
So your family decided to...

00:40:44,715 --> 00:40:46,984
take matters
into their own hands?

00:40:46,984 --> 00:40:48,552
Yes.

00:40:48,552 --> 00:40:51,155
My family ruined my life.

00:40:51,155 --> 00:40:53,290
Then why protect them?

00:40:55,059 --> 00:40:56,627
I'm not.
Tell me where your mother

00:40:56,627 --> 00:40:57,695
and brother are.

00:40:57,695 --> 00:40:59,263
I said I don't know.

00:40:59,263 --> 00:41:01,999
Come on, Heather.

00:41:01,999 --> 00:41:04,001
You don't know where
your mother and brother are?

00:41:04,001 --> 00:41:05,903
No!

00:41:12,176 --> 00:41:13,611
I don't believe you.

00:41:19,183 --> 00:41:21,585
People don't just vanish.

00:41:28,092 --> 00:41:31,996
They said they were going
to see a movie,

00:41:31,996 --> 00:41:34,064
and I haven't seen them since.
