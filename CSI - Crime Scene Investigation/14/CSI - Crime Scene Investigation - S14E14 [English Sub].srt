Ana is the only girl
I ever asked out.

00:00:22,182 --> 00:00:24,552

but still...

00:00:24,552 --> 00:00:26,487
(voices murmuring)

00:00:29,723 --> 00:00:31,725
Kid was a force of nature.

00:00:31,725 --> 00:00:33,027
She'd come into
my class laughing,

00:00:33,027 --> 00:00:34,128
and just...
light up the room.

00:00:35,396 --> 00:00:37,631

be forgotten.

00:00:37,631 --> 00:00:38,632

00:00:44,972 --> 00:00:46,874

00:00:53,814 --> 00:00:56,083
I still haven't heard
quite what happened.

00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:57,851
I didn't want to keep
the news of Ana's death

00:00:57,851 --> 00:00:59,453
from her friends and family,

00:00:59,453 --> 00:01:01,555
but there are certain details
of it which...

00:01:01,555 --> 00:01:03,557
remain unclear.

00:01:03,557 --> 00:01:05,426
Three days ago,

00:01:05,426 --> 00:01:06,894
Ana was discovered dead

00:01:06,894 --> 00:01:09,697
in the border city
of Arquero, Mexico.

00:01:09,697 --> 00:01:12,066
The local coroner
found her license on her,

00:01:12,066 --> 00:01:14,068
notified LVPD...

00:01:14,068 --> 00:01:17,471
calling her death
"drug-related."

00:01:17,471 --> 00:01:18,706
They sent these photos

00:01:18,706 --> 00:01:20,874
and prints to confirm
it was Ana.

00:01:20,874 --> 00:01:22,643
But he's been
otherwise uncooperative

00:01:22,643 --> 00:01:25,613
and refused to arrange transport
of the body to Las Vegas.

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,916
Has he performed
an autopsy?

00:01:28,916 --> 00:01:31,719
I demanded that he
not proceed with one.

00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:33,120
He's wrong about
Ana doing drugs,

00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,090
and I don't want him
getting anything else wrong.

00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,758
Al...

00:01:37,758 --> 00:01:39,994

00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:48,402

something that I can do.

00:01:48,402 --> 00:01:51,105

00:03:20,961 --> 00:03:22,796
Landlord came over
to collect the month's rent

00:03:22,796 --> 00:03:25,766
from the couple
who lives here.

00:03:25,766 --> 00:03:27,468
Came across this

00:03:27,468 --> 00:03:29,970
when he looked through

00:03:34,508 --> 00:03:35,642
Wow.

00:03:35,642 --> 00:03:37,511
That's one hell
of a body dump.

00:03:37,511 --> 00:03:39,079
Like they were dumped
by a cement truck.

00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:41,548
Got this picture
from inside.

00:03:41,548 --> 00:03:43,951
I'm pretty sure
this is the couple.

00:03:43,951 --> 00:03:45,719
Brett and Claire Marsh.

00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:47,855
Someone's been doing
a lot of work in here.

00:03:47,855 --> 00:03:49,423
SANDERS:
Landlord says

00:03:49,423 --> 00:03:51,859
that Brett had repaired
the sewer line

00:03:51,859 --> 00:03:53,827
and was in the middle
of replacing the floor.

00:03:53,827 --> 00:03:56,063
Yeah, but concrete's
not quicksand.

00:03:56,063 --> 00:03:58,398
They couldn't have just
gotten stuck in it.

00:03:58,398 --> 00:03:59,700
No, I'm thinking

00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,568
that someone was trying
to bury these two.

00:04:01,568 --> 00:04:02,803
PHILLIPS:
And the ground just

00:04:02,803 --> 00:04:04,071
vomited them
up, huh?

00:04:04,071 --> 00:04:05,873
Yeah, because someone
messed up the recipe.

00:04:05,873 --> 00:04:07,174
A couple of
these empty bags

00:04:07,174 --> 00:04:09,042
are expansive mortar.
It looks like concrete,

00:04:09,042 --> 00:04:10,944
but it's actually designed
to bust up concrete.

00:04:10,944 --> 00:04:12,412
You pour it
into drilled holes

00:04:12,412 --> 00:04:13,847
and it'll grow
to such a volume

00:04:13,847 --> 00:04:15,182
that it can crack solid rock.

00:04:15,182 --> 00:04:16,750
The stuff is mistakenly

00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,452

00:04:18,452 --> 00:04:21,955

My wife and my brother Jeff.

00:05:11,972 --> 00:05:13,807
I was only away
in Bakersfield for a night.

00:05:13,807 --> 00:05:15,108
What the hell
happened to them?

00:05:15,108 --> 00:05:16,510
You said that your brother

00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,778
was doing your cement work?

00:05:19,413 --> 00:05:22,749
He needed a
place to stay.

00:05:22,749 --> 00:05:24,051
So I let him crash.

00:05:27,054 --> 00:05:28,622
And I knew he'd screw it up,

00:09:11,678 --> 00:09:13,847
Are there other
staff here?

00:09:13,847 --> 00:09:16,550
Just me.
STOKES:
Wait a minute,
you handle

00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:18,652
over a thousand murders
a year by yourself?

00:09:18,652 --> 00:09:21,621
In a good year, yes.

00:09:21,621 --> 00:09:23,457
That's insane.

00:09:23,457 --> 00:09:26,059
There's only one body
that you're worried about.

00:09:26,059 --> 00:09:27,461
She wasn't murdered.

00:09:30,564 --> 00:09:32,065
Anonymous caller, uh, saw her

00:09:32,065 --> 00:09:34,101
by the side of the road
in the middle of nowhere.

00:09:34,101 --> 00:09:35,435
I picked her up.

00:09:35,435 --> 00:09:37,003
I found cocaine
inside her nostrils,

00:09:37,003 --> 00:09:38,405
all over her hair,

00:09:38,405 --> 00:09:40,140
her dress-- overdose.

00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,609
She has no history
of drug use.

00:09:42,609 --> 00:09:45,011
Says who?
Says me.

00:09:45,011 --> 00:09:46,680
(chuckles)

00:09:51,985 --> 00:09:53,687
You know, I'm starting
to get the feeling

00:09:53,687 --> 00:09:55,188
he doesn't want us around.

00:09:58,191 --> 00:10:00,660
♪ ♪

00:10:18,712 --> 00:10:21,047
♪ ♪

00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:25,519
Hey.
Hey.

00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,988
So, I had Dr. Blanco
give me Ana's clothes.

00:10:27,988 --> 00:10:29,923
There was no
butcher paper.

00:10:29,923 --> 00:10:33,193
So local news is going
to have to do here.

00:10:39,099 --> 00:10:40,834
Everything all right?

00:10:40,834 --> 00:10:43,570
Ana's father wanted
some answers.

00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:45,071
He's not gonna like them.

00:10:45,071 --> 00:10:48,108
Her hair is thinning, she
has sores on her mouth.

00:10:48,108 --> 00:10:50,143
The signs of sustained drug use.

00:10:50,143 --> 00:10:51,945
The degree of damage
to the liver and kidneys

00:10:51,945 --> 00:10:54,514
is further evidence
consistent with her being

00:10:54,514 --> 00:10:57,184
a serious long-term drug user.

00:10:57,184 --> 00:10:58,885
And her father had no idea?

00:10:58,885 --> 00:11:00,520
I don't think so.

00:11:02,822 --> 00:11:06,193
We'll express-ship a sample
of her heart blood to Vegas.

00:11:06,193 --> 00:11:08,395
Lab can run a drug panel.

00:11:08,395 --> 00:11:10,597
Blanco also gave me a sample
of the cocaine trace

00:11:10,597 --> 00:11:12,966
he found in her nose and hair.

00:11:12,966 --> 00:11:14,634
So we'll check that out.

00:11:14,634 --> 00:11:16,636
What's going on
with her feet?

00:11:16,636 --> 00:11:17,704
Are you seeing this?

00:11:17,704 --> 00:11:20,006
Well, it sounds kind of strange,

00:11:20,006 --> 00:11:21,041
but the tissue damage

00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:22,976
is consistent with frostbite.

00:11:22,976 --> 00:11:25,612
Frostbite?

00:11:25,612 --> 00:11:28,815
In a town where the morgue
doesn't drop below 50 degrees?

00:11:28,815 --> 00:11:29,783
You got me.

00:11:34,087 --> 00:11:37,057
Whoa, there's traces of cornhusk
all over this dress.

00:11:42,128 --> 00:11:44,798
Don't worry, Doc, we'll find out
exactly what happened to her.

00:11:44,798 --> 00:11:45,999
I hope so.

00:11:45,999 --> 00:11:47,067
Okay?

00:11:54,574 --> 00:11:56,876
Hey.
Hey.

00:11:56,876 --> 00:12:00,113
This is definitely Claire Marsh
and her husband's brother Jeff.

00:12:02,816 --> 00:12:05,685
Single GSWs
to their heads?

00:12:05,685 --> 00:12:08,021
Through and through on his,
no exit wound on hers.

00:12:08,021 --> 00:12:10,423
Expansive mortar did
the rest of this damage.

00:12:10,423 --> 00:12:13,693
Well, Finn is X-raying
the rest of the concrete now.

00:12:13,693 --> 00:12:15,562
She thought she saw
an embedded bullet,

00:12:15,562 --> 00:12:18,765
which means they were shot
in the garage.

00:12:18,765 --> 00:12:20,100
Right beside
their shallow grave.

00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,068
But the concrete
expanded and shifted,

00:12:22,068 --> 00:12:24,070
so we won't be able
to determine anything

00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:25,739
about the bullet's trajectory.

00:12:25,739 --> 00:12:27,674
(Sidle grunts)

00:12:31,511 --> 00:12:32,612
Greg.

00:12:32,612 --> 00:12:33,613
Look at this.

00:12:33,613 --> 00:12:34,614
A gun.

00:12:34,614 --> 00:12:36,616
Possible murder weapon?

00:12:36,616 --> 00:12:38,585
You know, I found
some antidepressants

00:12:38,585 --> 00:12:40,954
among Jeff's stuff at the house.

00:12:40,954 --> 00:12:44,024
Guy has emotional problems,
ends up with a gun in his hand?

00:12:44,024 --> 00:12:45,725
You're thinking murder-suicide.

00:12:45,725 --> 00:12:46,993
Wouldn't be
the first guy to covet

00:12:46,993 --> 00:12:48,662
his brother's wife.

00:12:48,662 --> 00:12:49,763
He wants to off himself.

00:12:49,763 --> 00:12:51,731
Decides to take her with him.

00:12:51,731 --> 00:12:54,768
So, he shoots her,
pours the concrete,

00:12:54,768 --> 00:12:57,637
and then snuggles up beside her
in the concrete.

00:12:57,637 --> 00:12:59,406
Bam.

00:12:59,406 --> 00:13:01,107
It's a possibility.

00:13:01,107 --> 00:13:03,710
Actually it's not.

00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:05,845
I found high-velocity
blood spatter

00:13:05,845 --> 00:13:07,847
on Claire's clothing.

00:13:07,847 --> 00:13:09,783
Wrong side to be from her GSW.

00:13:09,783 --> 00:13:12,585
So it was his, which means she
was standing out of the concrete

00:13:12,585 --> 00:13:14,621
next to him when he was shot.

00:13:14,621 --> 00:13:16,656
My theory--double murder,
killer plants the gun,

00:13:16,656 --> 00:13:18,491
buries them.

00:13:18,491 --> 00:13:20,460
Occam's razor is so dull.

00:13:29,736 --> 00:13:31,438
Okay.

00:13:31,438 --> 00:13:33,840
Doc's gathering his notes,
writing his report.

00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,675
We'll be out of here
first thing tomorrow.

00:13:35,675 --> 00:13:37,744
Cool. Secured some tacos
from down the street.

00:13:37,744 --> 00:13:39,479
Weapons-grade hot sauce.

00:13:39,479 --> 00:13:40,547
Thanks.

00:13:43,883 --> 00:13:44,884
So, did you read about

00:13:44,884 --> 00:13:46,486
this cartel massacre last week?

00:13:46,486 --> 00:13:48,488
Four gunned down,
one of them beheaded.

00:13:48,488 --> 00:13:51,091
I've got them
in the cooler right now.

00:13:51,091 --> 00:13:53,426
The news treats it like
it's something to celebrate.

00:13:53,426 --> 00:13:54,761
But look at these guys.

00:13:54,761 --> 00:13:56,129
Murder sells papers, amigo.

00:13:56,129 --> 00:13:57,864
Yeah, but it's
different down here.

00:13:57,864 --> 00:14:00,900
I mean, these cartel guys are
worshipped like celebrities.

00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,902
There's songs written
about their crimes.

00:14:02,902 --> 00:14:05,138
Sure, but wasn't Vegas
founded by criminals?

00:14:05,138 --> 00:14:07,440
You guys put your
mobsters in a museum.

00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,875
That's history, not news.

00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:11,578
Okay, so who do you think
buys all the drugs?

00:14:11,578 --> 00:14:12,746
Place like Sin City.

00:14:12,746 --> 00:14:15,014
Come do whatever you want.

00:14:15,014 --> 00:14:17,083
No cartels without customers.

00:14:24,124 --> 00:14:25,458
I think you hurt his feelings.

00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:26,993
Don't get me wrong, Stokes.

00:14:26,993 --> 00:14:29,629
You hook me up with a deal
at Caesars, I'm there.

00:14:40,807 --> 00:14:42,976
Something wrong, Nick?

00:14:42,976 --> 00:14:45,812
These men were all slaughtered
in a cartel hit last week.

00:14:45,812 --> 00:14:47,547
That paper shows

00:14:47,547 --> 00:14:49,783
cornhusks on the ground.

00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,822
It's all over them.

00:14:55,822 --> 00:14:58,425
That's the same trace that
was found on Ana Ortiz.

00:15:01,694 --> 00:15:03,463
Dr. Blanco?

00:15:03,463 --> 00:15:04,898
I think there's been

00:15:04,898 --> 00:15:07,767
a cross-contamination of
trace between the bodies.

00:15:07,767 --> 00:15:08,868
Bull.

00:15:08,868 --> 00:15:10,403
This place might
not be pretty,

00:15:10,403 --> 00:15:12,839
but I do my job right.

00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:14,140
I don't make mistakes like that.

00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,842
If that's true,
then Ana Ortiz

00:15:15,842 --> 00:15:18,144
was at the same place where
those four men were murdered.

00:15:18,144 --> 00:15:20,180
We found traces of cornhusk

00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,714
on her body,
the same way they had it.

00:15:25,084 --> 00:15:27,887
Dr. Blanco, there's more
to her story, isn't there?

00:15:30,857 --> 00:15:33,026
I recovered those men
from the site of the massacre.

00:15:33,026 --> 00:15:34,661
Cartel property.

00:15:34,661 --> 00:15:36,696
Used to be a
cornfield.

00:15:36,696 --> 00:15:41,100
Next day, an anonymous caller
said that I left a body behind.

00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,436
<i>Went back out there,</i>

00:15:43,436 --> 00:15:45,939
<i>little bit away from</i>
<i>where the other bodies fell.</i>

00:15:45,939 --> 00:15:50,610
<i>There was a girl.</i>

00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:52,178
So, you lied to us.

00:15:52,178 --> 00:15:54,848
You're here
for the girl.

00:15:54,848 --> 00:15:56,416
Not the cartel
killings.

00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:57,917
And she wasn't shot
like the other...

00:15:57,917 --> 00:16:00,453
men, so why-why keep
digging into it?

00:16:00,453 --> 00:16:02,922
I want to see the investigative
file on that shooting right now.

00:16:02,922 --> 00:16:04,724
She died of an overdose.

00:16:04,724 --> 00:16:06,726
An overdose of cocaine.

00:16:06,726 --> 00:16:07,727
All right?

00:16:07,727 --> 00:16:08,761
So, let it be.

00:16:08,761 --> 00:16:10,396
I need to see that file.

00:16:13,766 --> 00:16:14,767
There isn't one.

00:16:14,767 --> 00:16:15,902
Oh, come on.

00:16:15,902 --> 00:16:17,637
He's not lying to you, Stokes.

00:16:17,637 --> 00:16:20,139
Cartel-on-cartel crime,
nobody's looking into that.

00:16:20,139 --> 00:16:21,574
Then we will.

00:16:21,574 --> 00:16:23,076
What?
We came here

00:16:23,076 --> 00:16:24,878
to determine what happened
to Ana Ortiz.

00:16:24,878 --> 00:16:26,613
And by God,
that's what we're gonna do.

00:16:26,613 --> 00:16:28,848
Now, her body was found
at the scene

00:16:28,848 --> 00:16:30,450
of that massacre,
we're gonna go

00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,018
back out there,
and we're gonna process it.

00:16:32,018 --> 00:16:33,753
Nick, I'm not so sure...

00:16:33,753 --> 00:16:35,722
You want to go stand in a field
that's still bloody

00:16:35,722 --> 00:16:37,023
from the last guys
who stood there.

00:16:37,023 --> 00:16:38,625
We'd be target practice.

00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:40,960
Well, if you think
it's too dangerous...

00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,161
I'll go alone.

00:17:03,516 --> 00:17:06,519
(speaking in Spanish)

00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:08,054
You trust these guys?

00:17:08,054 --> 00:17:10,890
Local PD was the best protection
my office could coordinate.

00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:13,126
These guys are safer
than nothing.

00:17:13,126 --> 00:17:15,061
That's debatable.

00:17:16,696 --> 00:17:19,432
So, Dr. Blanco

00:17:19,432 --> 00:17:23,436
said he found Ana's body
right around here.

00:17:23,436 --> 00:17:25,171
And look at this.

00:17:25,171 --> 00:17:26,506
Same cocaine trace

00:17:26,506 --> 00:17:28,474
that was found in Ana's nose.

00:17:31,044 --> 00:17:32,612
(speaking Spanish)

00:17:34,013 --> 00:17:35,748
Tire treads.

00:17:35,748 --> 00:17:38,618
Looks like they came to a stop

00:17:38,618 --> 00:17:39,919
right here.

00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,421
SILVA:
18-wheeler.

00:17:45,091 --> 00:17:48,761
Javier, there's flakes of blood
in these treads.

00:17:48,761 --> 00:17:50,863
The truck drove through
the blood from the massacre.

00:17:50,863 --> 00:17:52,465
(gunfire)

00:17:52,465 --> 00:17:54,934
That's what I'm thinking.

00:17:54,934 --> 00:17:57,670
(policemen speaking Spanish)

00:18:01,874 --> 00:18:03,042
Who the hell is that?

00:18:03,042 --> 00:18:05,812
<i>¿Quien es ese, señor?</i>

00:18:12,619 --> 00:18:13,653
Be ready.

00:18:17,824 --> 00:18:19,859
(gun clicks)

00:18:22,762 --> 00:18:25,965
(speaking Spanish)

00:18:32,105 --> 00:18:34,173
What was that?
Said he heard
we were investigating

00:18:34,173 --> 00:18:35,975
an overdosed American girl,

00:18:35,975 --> 00:18:38,578
so why the hell are we poking
around the blood of the cartel?

00:18:46,152 --> 00:18:47,887
Right.

00:18:47,887 --> 00:18:49,455
You know,
the way the blood

00:18:49,455 --> 00:18:51,457
is flaked in these treads
tells me this blood pool

00:18:51,457 --> 00:18:53,159
was dry when the truck drove
through it,

00:18:53,159 --> 00:18:55,128
and that was at least
a couple hours

00:18:55,128 --> 00:18:56,929
after the massacre.

00:18:56,929 --> 00:19:00,733
It stopped right there,
and it dumped Ana's body

00:19:00,733 --> 00:19:02,168
right over there.

00:19:02,168 --> 00:19:04,937
Fascinating.
Can we get the hell out of here?

00:19:06,406 --> 00:19:08,141
Yeah, let's go.

00:19:25,992 --> 00:19:27,794
♪ ♪

00:19:41,174 --> 00:19:42,642
Hey.
Hey.

00:19:42,642 --> 00:19:43,843
Just finished processing

00:19:43,843 --> 00:19:46,145
the concrete couple's
clothes.

00:19:46,145 --> 00:19:49,048
That was kind of a sexy little
dress she had on there.

00:19:49,048 --> 00:19:52,652
Nice shoes, too,
although the, uh, soles had

00:19:52,652 --> 00:19:54,721
speckles of paint on them.
Well, I have

00:19:54,721 --> 00:19:56,823
a bullet and I have a gun,

00:19:56,823 --> 00:19:58,424
but I have no way
to fire it

00:19:58,424 --> 00:20:00,760
to make a comparison,
because the gun barrel

00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,729
is split like a banana peel.

00:20:02,729 --> 00:20:04,997
The expansive mortar got in it.
Yeah.

00:20:04,997 --> 00:20:06,599
So I've tried
something different.

00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:08,601
I've Microsiled
the inside

00:20:08,601 --> 00:20:10,737
of the barrel.
That works?

00:20:16,409 --> 00:20:18,544
Yes, it does.

00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,654
It's a match.

00:20:28,654 --> 00:20:30,022
We've got our murder weapon.

00:20:30,022 --> 00:20:31,891
The killer left it
in the vic's hand.

00:20:31,891 --> 00:20:33,693
Oh, I also found
an errant hair

00:20:33,693 --> 00:20:36,796
in the cement.
Henry ran DNA on it.

00:20:36,796 --> 00:20:39,499
Did not match either one
of our victims, so...

00:20:39,499 --> 00:20:41,634
hopefully could
be the killer's.

00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:46,539
I can smell the health code
violations in that place

00:20:46,539 --> 00:20:48,508
from here, Doc.
ROBBINS:
Hodges...

00:20:48,508 --> 00:20:51,144
Promise me I can't get a staph
infection through the Internet.

00:20:51,144 --> 00:20:53,679
Hodges, the tox reports, please.

00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,817
Right. I ran a full drug screen
on the sample of heart blood

00:20:57,817 --> 00:20:58,951
you sent.

00:20:58,951 --> 00:21:01,854
Ana Ortiz was completely clean.

00:21:01,854 --> 00:21:03,189
ROBBINS:
Well, that makes
no sense.

00:21:03,189 --> 00:21:06,425
Cocaine was collected
from inside her nostrils.

00:21:06,425 --> 00:21:07,727
Well, then she
must have exercised

00:21:07,727 --> 00:21:09,695
remarkable nasal restraint.

00:21:09,695 --> 00:21:11,430
Don't know what else
I can tell you.

00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:12,865
Oh, yeah...
Hmm.

00:21:12,865 --> 00:21:15,001
Definitely see some mold spores
up in that corner

00:21:15,001 --> 00:21:17,637
of the ceiling over there.
Hodges, uh, we're
starting to lose connection.

00:21:17,637 --> 00:21:18,638
Thank you, Hodges.

00:21:18,638 --> 00:21:20,473
Whoa, wait a...

00:21:20,473 --> 00:21:23,442
(sighs) Uh, Dr. Blanco, may I
use one of your microscopes?

00:21:23,442 --> 00:21:25,578
Should I check it for
health code violations?

00:21:25,578 --> 00:21:27,847
That man is a hypochondriac

00:21:27,847 --> 00:21:30,783
and a lunatic, and I apologize.

00:21:34,687 --> 00:21:36,455
Thank you.

00:21:36,455 --> 00:21:37,790
So what are
you thinking?

00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:41,828
Now, with a drug overdose
eliminated,

00:21:41,828 --> 00:21:45,998
other explanation
for Ana's symptoms is poisoning.

00:21:45,998 --> 00:21:47,500
Look at that.

00:21:49,068 --> 00:21:52,605
BLANCO:
Alternating dark bands
near the root.

00:21:52,605 --> 00:21:54,006
Heavy metal poisoning?

00:21:54,006 --> 00:21:55,741
Certainly appears
that way.

00:21:55,741 --> 00:21:57,009
Seen my share of that.

00:21:58,744 --> 00:22:00,980
As a young coroner, this area

00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:03,850
was full
of industrial pollution.

00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:06,519
Factories were no better
than the cartels.

00:22:07,954 --> 00:22:09,188
They left babies
on my table.

00:22:13,492 --> 00:22:14,794
Oh, yeah. Mees' lines.

00:22:14,794 --> 00:22:16,462
Consistent with
heavy metal poisoning.

00:22:16,462 --> 00:22:18,698
It could also explain
the frostbite on her feet.

00:22:18,698 --> 00:22:21,968
Toxic metals can cause
peripheral neuropathy,
Yeah.

00:22:21,968 --> 00:22:23,803
make one's feet feel
like they're burning.

00:22:23,803 --> 00:22:25,137
She may have been icing them.

00:22:25,137 --> 00:22:28,040
So the question is,
how was she poisoned

00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:31,577
and why did she end up
at that massacre site?

00:22:31,577 --> 00:22:33,880
She was dumped there
by a semi truck,

00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,715
hours after the shooting.

00:22:35,715 --> 00:22:37,884
Well, Nick, I'll match
and raise your discovery.

00:22:37,884 --> 00:22:40,586
Ana Ortiz didn't have
any drugs in her system.

00:22:40,586 --> 00:22:42,922
Not an overdose.
Heavy metal poisoning.

00:22:42,922 --> 00:22:44,123
Wait a minute, now.

00:22:44,123 --> 00:22:46,792
Then what is this stuff?

00:22:46,792 --> 00:22:49,061
I was hoping you'd
figure that out.

00:22:49,061 --> 00:22:50,129
Okay.

00:22:51,864 --> 00:22:53,132
Is that your water, Doctor?

00:23:00,907 --> 00:23:02,475
Doesn't dissolve in water.

00:23:02,475 --> 00:23:04,443
Not cocaine.

00:23:10,983 --> 00:23:13,486
This is pulverized plastic.

00:23:13,486 --> 00:23:14,754
They melt it
down and use it

00:23:14,754 --> 00:23:16,956
to make milk jugs,
stuff like that.

00:23:16,956 --> 00:23:19,558
So how did it
get on Ana Ortiz?

00:23:19,558 --> 00:23:22,028
Any, uh, plastics production
around here?

00:23:22,028 --> 00:23:23,763
There's a plant outside of town.

00:23:23,763 --> 00:23:26,098
ROBBINS:
Well, the fact that Ana
had it in her nose

00:23:26,098 --> 00:23:28,668
and her hair suggests
she was around a lot of it.

00:23:28,668 --> 00:23:30,503
Maybe buried in it.
Semi could've come

00:23:30,503 --> 00:23:32,004
from that plant.

00:23:32,004 --> 00:23:33,706
I got to get out there,

00:23:33,706 --> 00:23:35,041
check out those
trucking records.

00:23:35,041 --> 00:23:38,878
That plant-- like much
around here-- is infected.

00:23:38,878 --> 00:23:41,747
Ties to cartel trafficking
and money laundering.

00:23:41,747 --> 00:23:43,883
They're not gonna be happy
to see you there, my friend.

00:23:43,883 --> 00:23:44,884
I don't care.

00:23:44,884 --> 00:23:46,052
What did I miss?

00:23:46,052 --> 00:23:47,787
Hey, grab your stuff.

00:23:47,787 --> 00:23:49,088
We're going on
another field trip.

00:23:49,088 --> 00:23:50,690
<i>¿Otra vez?</i>

00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:51,958
Yippie ki-yay.

00:23:55,695 --> 00:23:58,564
SANDERS:
The concrete the killer
poured all over

00:23:58,564 --> 00:24:00,566
your wife
and brother's bodies...

00:24:00,566 --> 00:24:02,034
we crushed it all up.

00:24:02,034 --> 00:24:04,570
Found this hair.

00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:05,738
It's yours.

00:24:06,772 --> 00:24:08,474
It's my equipment.

00:24:08,474 --> 00:24:10,176
The hair must have been
in the mixer from before.

00:24:10,176 --> 00:24:13,646
Do you, uh, have
receipts from your trip,

00:24:13,646 --> 00:24:15,514
to show that you were
in Bakersfield all night?

00:24:15,514 --> 00:24:17,149
You mean for an alibi.

00:24:17,149 --> 00:24:19,051
Why the hell would I kill
my own wife and brother?

00:24:19,051 --> 00:24:22,555
Your wife was wearing a pretty
revealing outfit when she died.

00:24:22,555 --> 00:24:27,560
So?
So... your brother, alone
in the house with your wife.

00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:30,730
You head out of town,
come home early,

00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:32,398
catch them in the middle
of something.

00:24:32,398 --> 00:24:35,067
What kind of slapstick porno
are you living in, pal?

00:24:35,067 --> 00:24:37,603
My wife, with Jeff?

00:24:37,603 --> 00:24:38,904
My wife had the
house fumigated

00:24:38,904 --> 00:24:40,740
after Jeff visited for
Christmas last year.

00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,441
She looked at him
like he was an ape.

00:24:42,441 --> 00:24:45,745
Claire with Jeff?

00:24:45,745 --> 00:24:49,015
Not in a million lifetimes.

00:24:49,015 --> 00:24:50,883
I'll get you those
receipts from my trip.

00:24:50,883 --> 00:24:54,153
But tell me you guys are working
on some real leads, too, right?

00:24:56,522 --> 00:24:58,424
That's the plastic company's
trucking records

00:24:58,424 --> 00:25:00,059
for the last two weeks.

00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:01,727
How'd you
get that?
Slipped some cash

00:25:01,727 --> 00:25:02,695
to an office clerk.

00:25:02,695 --> 00:25:04,430
I mean, you were
right, Dr. B.

00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:06,499
They're into a lot more
than just plastic over there.

00:25:06,499 --> 00:25:08,034
A lot of firepower.
I mean, who needs

00:25:08,034 --> 00:25:10,136
an M-16 to guard milk jugs,
you know what I mean?

00:25:10,136 --> 00:25:11,837
ROBBINS:
So, let's see
who was trucking

00:25:11,837 --> 00:25:14,507
pulverized plastics
when Ana Ortiz was dumped.

00:25:14,507 --> 00:25:15,508
On the ground.

00:25:15,508 --> 00:25:16,976
<i>En el piso.</i>

00:25:16,976 --> 00:25:18,911
Get back, get
back, guys.
<i>Somos policía.</i>

00:25:18,911 --> 00:25:20,146
<i>¿Qué pasó?</i>

00:25:20,146 --> 00:25:21,947
NICK:
What's going on?

00:25:21,947 --> 00:25:23,816
(officers yelling in Spanish)

00:25:26,485 --> 00:25:28,120
Whoa!
Oh!

00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,655
Javier Silva.
You're under arrest

00:25:29,655 --> 00:25:30,790
for the murder of Ana Ortiz.

00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:32,892
<i>¿Qué?</i>
What?

00:25:32,892 --> 00:25:34,593
That's crazy, man.
Who-Who sent you guys

00:25:34,593 --> 00:25:36,862
down here, huh?
Who told you to come do this?

00:25:36,862 --> 00:25:39,031
Hey!

00:25:39,031 --> 00:25:40,866
Hey.

00:25:40,866 --> 00:25:42,968
It's gonna be
all right, Javier.

00:25:53,012 --> 00:25:54,680
STOKES:
Oh, we're all right.

00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,416
I mean, we're under house ar...
well, morgue arrest.

00:25:57,416 --> 00:25:58,918
But we're fine.

00:25:58,918 --> 00:26:00,486
BRASS:
Well, I'm here with
representatives

00:26:00,486 --> 00:26:01,887
of the State Department.

00:26:01,887 --> 00:26:04,457
We're going to extricate you
and the doc ASAP.

00:26:04,457 --> 00:26:05,791
But there's a snag.

00:26:05,791 --> 00:26:07,693
The Arquero police department
has the two of you

00:26:07,693 --> 00:26:09,562
as persons of interest

00:26:09,562 --> 00:26:11,764
in the death Ana Ortiz.
You got to be
kidding me. Really?

00:26:11,764 --> 00:26:13,799
The investigation obviously
stepped on the wrong

00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:15,634
snakeskin boots.
Well, I'm worried about

00:26:15,634 --> 00:26:17,603
how they're taking it
out on Agent Silva.

00:26:17,603 --> 00:26:19,672
There's no word from
him yet, is there?

00:26:19,672 --> 00:26:20,806
Nada. That's a negative.

00:26:20,806 --> 00:26:22,108
But hang tight, Nicky.

00:26:22,108 --> 00:26:23,742
We'll get you out of there.
Okay.

00:26:23,742 --> 00:26:26,145
(phone clicks off)
Well...

00:26:26,145 --> 00:26:29,048
How you guys feeling?

00:26:29,048 --> 00:26:30,082
Splendid.

00:26:30,082 --> 00:26:31,083
I love visitors.

00:26:31,083 --> 00:26:33,419
ROBBINS:
Listen, the best way

00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:36,555
we can help
Agent Silva...

00:26:36,555 --> 00:26:38,991
is to find out exactly

00:26:38,991 --> 00:26:40,960
what happened to Ana Ortiz.

00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,728
The trucking
records.

00:26:43,996 --> 00:26:45,865
I'll entertain the company.

00:26:53,539 --> 00:26:55,541
You think Ana
came down here,

00:26:55,541 --> 00:26:58,144
crossed paths
with the cartel somehow,

00:26:58,144 --> 00:27:00,980
and they had one of their
truckers dispose of her body?

00:27:10,789 --> 00:27:14,026
Hey, Doc, I'm not so sure that
trouble found her down here.

00:27:15,628 --> 00:27:17,596
I think that trouble
found her in Las Vegas.

00:27:17,596 --> 00:27:20,966
Take a look at this
trucker, right here.

00:27:20,966 --> 00:27:23,469
Now, he's from Arquero,
but he has a regular route

00:27:23,469 --> 00:27:25,404
between here and Las Vegas.

00:27:25,404 --> 00:27:27,072
He was in Las Vegas
eight days ago.

00:27:27,072 --> 00:27:28,874
When Ana went missing.

00:27:28,874 --> 00:27:29,942
That's right.

00:27:36,815 --> 00:27:38,484
Hey, Jim,

00:27:38,484 --> 00:27:40,519
it's Nick again. Listen,
I think I have someone

00:27:40,519 --> 00:27:42,421
you guys should look into.

00:27:44,723 --> 00:27:47,626
How we doing with
Nick's trucker suspect?

00:27:47,626 --> 00:27:50,563
Well, the Vegas plastics
company's been cooperative.

00:27:50,563 --> 00:27:53,065
Given us some good information
on Mateo Garcia's truck

00:27:53,065 --> 00:27:54,500
and his schedule.

00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,769
He is on his way
to Las Vegas right now

00:27:56,769 --> 00:27:58,504
to pick up his
regular shipment.

00:27:58,504 --> 00:28:00,873
Should be in Las
Vegas by breakfast.

00:28:00,873 --> 00:28:02,041
And Brass will pick him up.

00:28:02,041 --> 00:28:04,043
Okay, thanks.

00:28:04,043 --> 00:28:06,812
I really appreciate your
concern, David, but we're fine.

00:28:06,812 --> 00:28:09,582
Are you sure?
I-I'll call my dad's

00:28:09,582 --> 00:28:10,950
Air Force buddies.
Some of those guys

00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:12,885
are crazy enough
to come get you.

00:28:12,885 --> 00:28:14,753
I'll take a rain check, okay?

00:28:14,753 --> 00:28:17,690
Hey, I, uh... I heard about
the concrete couple.

00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:20,059
How did their autopsies go?

00:28:20,059 --> 00:28:21,694
You're checking up on my work?

00:28:21,694 --> 00:28:23,062
Of course not.

00:28:23,062 --> 00:28:24,697
I'm just killing some time.

00:28:24,697 --> 00:28:27,433
Oh. Okay, well,
let's take a look.

00:28:27,433 --> 00:28:30,436
Nothing surprising on him.

00:28:30,436 --> 00:28:33,572
C.O.D. is a gunshot wound
to the temple.

00:28:33,572 --> 00:28:35,474
Big exit wound, though.

00:28:35,474 --> 00:28:38,877
But with her, things are
a bit more complicated.

00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:44,083
That hole in her head
would be my guess.

00:28:44,083 --> 00:28:45,484
Thank you, Dr. Blanco.

00:28:45,484 --> 00:28:47,419
And you are right.

00:28:47,419 --> 00:28:49,421
C.O.D. is the gunshot wound.

00:28:49,421 --> 00:28:51,123
But...

00:28:51,123 --> 00:28:54,159
there are other factors.

00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:56,795
Extensive damage to the liver
and the kidneys.

00:28:56,795 --> 00:28:59,632
And, Doc,

00:28:59,632 --> 00:29:01,033
I took a look at her hair

00:29:01,033 --> 00:29:03,569
and I saw alternating
dark bands.

00:29:06,605 --> 00:29:08,107
Check her fingernails, David.

00:29:08,107 --> 00:29:09,408
Gotcha.

00:29:09,408 --> 00:29:11,977
False nails.

00:29:11,977 --> 00:29:13,545
One's missing.

00:29:13,545 --> 00:29:15,481
I'll see if I can
scrape off the glue.

00:29:15,481 --> 00:29:16,482
Good.

00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:21,787
Mees' lines.

00:29:21,787 --> 00:29:23,455
Heavy metal poisoning?

00:29:23,455 --> 00:29:25,591
(exhales)
Go to the scope.

00:29:25,591 --> 00:29:28,193
Get measurements
on the dark bands

00:29:28,193 --> 00:29:29,495
in her hair.

00:29:29,495 --> 00:29:31,063
Absolutely.

00:29:33,565 --> 00:29:34,700
Two bands,

00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:37,102
half a millimeter wide.

00:29:37,102 --> 00:29:39,104
And a half a millimeter apart.

00:29:39,104 --> 00:29:41,674
Poisoned on
alternating days.

00:29:41,674 --> 00:29:42,841
Same pattern
as Ana Ortiz.

00:29:42,841 --> 00:29:44,743
David, two women
from Vegas

00:29:44,743 --> 00:29:47,446
poisoned the same way--
that can't be coincidence.

00:29:47,446 --> 00:29:49,715
Doc, you went all
the way down to Mexico

00:29:49,715 --> 00:29:53,118
and we're working
on the same case.

00:29:53,118 --> 00:29:54,853
BRASS:
So you got her
in your truck,

00:29:54,853 --> 00:29:56,455
and you took
her for a ride,

00:29:56,455 --> 00:29:57,690
isn't that right, Mateo?

00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:59,124
I have no idea
what happened to her.

00:29:59,124 --> 00:30:00,959
Well, let me jog
your memory, okay?

00:30:00,959 --> 00:30:02,895
You're on a long haul,
you're a lonely guy.

00:30:02,895 --> 00:30:05,831
You see a beautiful
girl in Vegas.
You pick her up.

00:30:05,831 --> 00:30:09,001
Maybe she'll accompany
you on your trip
to Arquero, right?

00:30:09,001 --> 00:30:11,136
No.
We know that you
drove her down there.

00:30:11,136 --> 00:30:12,871
But I didn't know.

00:30:12,871 --> 00:30:15,874
All right? I loaded
my truck at the Vegas plant.

00:30:15,874 --> 00:30:18,444
20 drums of pulverized plastic.
Mm-hmm.

00:30:18,444 --> 00:30:20,079
Drove it down
to Arquero.
Okay.

00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:21,947
Straight through,
no stops.

00:30:21,947 --> 00:30:25,184
When I got there,
I started unloading.

00:30:25,184 --> 00:30:28,487
One of the drums felt...
too heavy.

00:30:28,487 --> 00:30:30,723
She was inside.

00:30:30,723 --> 00:30:31,724
<i>Muerta.</i>

00:30:31,724 --> 00:30:33,459
<i>Muerta.</i>

00:30:33,459 --> 00:30:35,427
And how did she
end up like that?

00:30:35,427 --> 00:30:36,595
<i>Yo no sé.</i>

00:30:36,595 --> 00:30:38,864
But I called
the Arquero police.

00:30:38,864 --> 00:30:41,467
They wanted nothing to do
with a dead American girl.

00:30:41,467 --> 00:30:44,703
So you dumped this
poor girl's body

00:30:44,703 --> 00:30:46,739
like a piece of
road trip trash

00:30:46,739 --> 00:30:48,173
in a field?

00:30:48,173 --> 00:30:49,975
Señor,

00:30:49,975 --> 00:30:53,712
I could have made it so that
nobody ever saw her again.

00:30:53,712 --> 00:30:56,482
But I wanted the girl,

00:30:56,482 --> 00:30:58,517
<i>y su familia,</i>

00:30:58,517 --> 00:31:00,152
to get a chance
to get some answers.

00:31:00,152 --> 00:31:03,122
So I hear about
the cartel massacre,

00:31:03,122 --> 00:31:06,191
and I took the girl
to that field.

00:31:06,191 --> 00:31:09,528
And then you told the
coroner he missed one.

00:31:09,528 --> 00:31:13,432
Whatever happened
to that poor girl,

00:31:13,432 --> 00:31:15,734
it happened up here.

00:31:15,734 --> 00:31:17,903
BRODY:
<i>So Brass thinks</i>
<i>that the truck driver</i>

00:31:17,903 --> 00:31:21,774
was just an unwitting
transporter of Ana Ortiz's body?

00:31:21,774 --> 00:31:23,542
Well, tox says
both Ana and Claire

00:31:23,542 --> 00:31:24,743
were poisoned by thallium.

00:31:24,743 --> 00:31:26,512
Same pattern of dosing.

00:31:26,512 --> 00:31:29,181
So it has to be the
same poison suspect.

00:31:29,181 --> 00:31:32,684
Whoever that is must have dumped
Ana Ortiz's body in the barrel

00:31:32,684 --> 00:31:34,653
at the Las Vegas
plastics facility.

00:31:34,653 --> 00:31:37,156
And then moved on
to their next victim.

00:31:37,156 --> 00:31:40,025
All right, so hair analysis
shows that Claire's poisoning

00:31:40,025 --> 00:31:42,661
began four days after
Ana's body was dumped.

00:31:42,661 --> 00:31:44,663
But before the poison had
the chance to kill Claire,

00:31:44,663 --> 00:31:47,399
she was gunned down
along with her Jeff Marsh.

00:31:47,399 --> 00:31:50,502
Yeah, I feel like
the killer panicked,

00:31:50,502 --> 00:31:53,005
like he couldn't wait
for the poison to do its job.

00:31:53,005 --> 00:31:55,808
Ana's disappearance was
getting a lot of attention.

00:31:55,808 --> 00:31:57,609
It might have put
pressure on him.

00:31:57,609 --> 00:32:00,479
You know, Ana and Claire
have the same killer.

00:32:00,479 --> 00:32:02,080
So what else do they
have in common?

00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,483
Any overlap
in their life could be

00:32:04,483 --> 00:32:06,685
where they crossed paths
with their assailant.

00:32:06,685 --> 00:32:08,454
Well, Ana's 18,

00:32:08,454 --> 00:32:09,855
child of privilege.

00:32:09,855 --> 00:32:12,724
Claire is 15 years older,
scraping by

00:32:12,724 --> 00:32:14,960
on temp receptionist
jobs around town.

00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,862
And they lived
in different neighborhoods.

00:32:16,862 --> 00:32:18,697
No apparent
family connection.

00:32:18,697 --> 00:32:20,666
You guys, tip just
came in from PD.

00:32:20,666 --> 00:32:22,568
A friend of Claire's
heard about her murder,

00:32:22,568 --> 00:32:24,069
and thought this
could be a lead.

00:32:24,069 --> 00:32:26,171
Claire texted her
this photo three days ago.

00:32:26,171 --> 00:32:28,640
"Ready for a visit
with my artiste."

00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,175
Seeing someone
on the side?

00:32:30,175 --> 00:32:32,177
Friend said Claire didn't
give her any details,

00:32:32,177 --> 00:32:35,447
but, Morgan, you found trace of
paint on Claire's shoes, right?

00:32:35,447 --> 00:32:37,950
It could be that Claire
had contact with this artiste

00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:39,585
around the time of her death.

00:32:39,585 --> 00:32:41,453
Anything that can help solve
Claire's case

00:32:41,453 --> 00:32:42,788
can help solve Ana's.

00:32:42,788 --> 00:32:44,456
Where was
the photo taken?

00:32:44,456 --> 00:32:46,024
Henry just analyzed
the metadata.

00:32:46,024 --> 00:32:48,494
Picture was snapped at a house
in Henderson.

00:32:48,494 --> 00:32:50,162
Want to check it out?

00:32:50,162 --> 00:32:51,763
LVPD!

00:32:57,870 --> 00:33:01,807
Elderly homeowner leases out
the guesthouse to a guy.

00:33:01,807 --> 00:33:04,409
Uses it as his
studio, pays cash.

00:33:04,409 --> 00:33:06,144
All clear.

00:33:06,144 --> 00:33:08,046
You got a name?

00:33:08,046 --> 00:33:10,983
No, she swears she
wrote it down somewhere.

00:33:19,958 --> 00:33:21,927
♪ ♪

00:33:51,189 --> 00:33:53,058
Ana Ortiz.

00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:00,933
Claire Marsh.

00:34:00,933 --> 00:34:02,000
Lifelike.

00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,936
For the last time.

00:34:12,544 --> 00:34:14,713
It's a shame the artist
didn't sign his work.

00:34:14,713 --> 00:34:17,182
Didn't leave
any indication of who he is.

00:34:17,182 --> 00:34:20,953
You know, Claire was wearing
that dress when she was shot.

00:34:20,953 --> 00:34:23,755
<i>Maybe she was here</i>
<i>shortly before, posing.</i>

00:34:27,025 --> 00:34:28,860
Whoa.

00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,495
Got some broken glass.

00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,469
Red wine with trace
of something in it.

00:34:40,072 --> 00:34:42,941
Got some personal letters here.

00:34:44,042 --> 00:34:47,579
Green flame.

00:34:47,579 --> 00:34:48,680
It's thallium.

00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,515
He hid the poison in the wine.

00:34:52,117 --> 00:34:56,588
SANDERS:
<i>Tastelsess, odorless.</i>

00:34:56,588 --> 00:34:57,656
The victims had no idea.

00:35:00,492 --> 00:35:03,195
Greg, one of these
is from Ana Ortiz.

00:35:03,195 --> 00:35:06,398
"My love,
I can't be yours forever.

00:35:06,398 --> 00:35:07,733
"You're capturing me
in your work,

00:35:07,733 --> 00:35:09,901
and that will have
to be enough for now."

00:35:09,901 --> 00:35:11,436
She was pulling away from him.

00:35:11,436 --> 00:35:13,672
But he wasn't going
to let that happen.

00:35:13,672 --> 00:35:16,675
He poisoned her to weaken her,
make her sick,

00:35:16,675 --> 00:35:18,577
dependent on him so
she couldn't leave,

00:35:18,577 --> 00:35:20,045
but he pushed
it too far.

00:35:20,045 --> 00:35:23,415
When a sadist kills a plaything,
he needs a replacement.

00:35:23,415 --> 00:35:25,550
A new victim to control.
Claire.

00:35:33,091 --> 00:35:34,760
Hey.

00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:37,095
Claire was missing
an acrylic fingernail.

00:35:37,095 --> 00:35:39,698
Here it is.

00:35:41,466 --> 00:35:44,102
You know, Ana was
all over the news.

00:35:44,102 --> 00:35:46,471
Claire might have
recognized her.

00:35:46,471 --> 00:35:49,107
SIDLE:
<i>She was holding</i>
<i>a portrait of Ana...</i>

00:35:49,107 --> 00:35:50,709
She looks familiar.

00:35:50,709 --> 00:35:53,145
<i>Then the artist yanked it away</i>
<i>from her.</i>

00:35:53,145 --> 00:35:55,180
SANDERS:
<i>She realized he was bad news.</i>

00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:58,550
SIDLE:
<i>He follows her home</i>
<i>to silence her.</i>

00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:00,585
<i>Brother-in-law had the bad luck</i>
<i>of being there.</i>

00:36:05,157 --> 00:36:07,526
Claire was gonna be an artist
before we met.

00:36:07,526 --> 00:36:08,960
Still had some friends
from back then.

00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,163
One of the guys--
she used to model for him.

00:36:11,163 --> 00:36:13,765
I told her I didn't
want to hear about it.
Well, I want to hear about it.

00:36:13,765 --> 00:36:15,567
So, this dude's the killer,
you're saying?

00:36:15,567 --> 00:36:16,902
It's just someone
we want to talk to.

00:36:16,902 --> 00:36:18,170
What's his name?

00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:19,705
I don't remember.

00:36:19,705 --> 00:36:21,840
You don't remember?
No!

00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,142
I wasn't interested
in hearing about some guy,

00:36:24,142 --> 00:36:27,779
sat there staring at my wife
with his brush in his hand.

00:36:27,779 --> 00:36:29,848
If I knew his name,
I'd tell you.

00:36:29,848 --> 00:36:31,149
RUSSELL:
<i>We found some letters</i>

00:36:31,149 --> 00:36:33,552
that Ana wrote
that lead us to believe

00:36:33,552 --> 00:36:37,522
that the artist who painted this
was in a relationship

00:36:37,522 --> 00:36:39,591
with your daughter.

00:36:39,591 --> 00:36:41,860
Why would Ana keep
that from me?
Well, I don't know.

00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:44,062
I don't know.
Maybe he was an older man.

00:36:44,062 --> 00:36:49,000
Somebody who could manipulate
her into keeping a secret.

00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,502
This is the person
who hurt her.

00:36:50,502 --> 00:36:52,771
Yeah, look, there's one
other thing, sir.

00:36:52,771 --> 00:36:57,542
My... my CSIs found
a trucking manifest.

00:36:57,542 --> 00:36:59,678
Ana's body was found
in a barrel

00:36:59,678 --> 00:37:02,514
that belonged to a company
here in Las Vegas.

00:37:02,514 --> 00:37:04,883
A Partell Manufacturing.

00:37:04,883 --> 00:37:05,984
What?

00:37:05,984 --> 00:37:08,019
We checked
the employment records,

00:37:08,019 --> 00:37:11,523
and the other victim,
Claire Marsh, worked for Partell

00:37:11,523 --> 00:37:14,860
recently for a few days
as a temporary receptionist.

00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:16,828
We've also discovered that...

00:37:16,828 --> 00:37:19,965
you're on the board
of... of that company.

00:37:19,965 --> 00:37:22,634
I hope you're not implying that
I had something to do with it.

00:37:22,634 --> 00:37:24,136
Absolutely not.

00:37:24,136 --> 00:37:27,639
But the fact that your daughter
and another woman

00:37:27,639 --> 00:37:29,641
who was employed by a company

00:37:29,641 --> 00:37:33,745
that at least you're involved
with, were both victims...

00:37:33,745 --> 00:37:34,880
You know, I was just hoping

00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,181
you could help us
connect the dots.

00:37:36,181 --> 00:37:37,983
That's all.

00:37:37,983 --> 00:37:39,584
You know anyone like that?

00:37:39,584 --> 00:37:41,920
I mean, who... who would be
capable of such a thing?

00:37:44,022 --> 00:37:45,190
Nobody.

00:37:47,459 --> 00:37:49,694
So, if we're done...

00:37:49,694 --> 00:37:50,896
I think I need
to go rest now.

00:37:52,631 --> 00:37:53,765
You can see yourself out.

00:37:59,171 --> 00:38:00,705
SIDLE:
<i>Russell?</i>

00:38:00,705 --> 00:38:02,707
I checked with Partell
Manufacturing HR,

00:38:02,707 --> 00:38:05,911
any chance they have an employee
who also is a known artist.

00:38:05,911 --> 00:38:07,913
Turns out they just
commissioned a mural

00:38:07,913 --> 00:38:09,514
in their cafeteria.

00:38:09,514 --> 00:38:10,982
Artist's name is
Keith Garner.

00:38:10,982 --> 00:38:12,951
He worked on it
late at night,

00:38:12,951 --> 00:38:15,720
because he's also
got a day job.

00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,622
Garner's day job is an

00:38:17,622 --> 00:38:19,758
art teacher,
Ana Ortiz's high school.

00:38:19,758 --> 00:38:22,160
Guess where he taught
15 years ago.

00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,728
Claire Marsh's high school.

00:38:23,728 --> 00:38:25,964
He knew both our victims
as young students.

00:38:25,964 --> 00:38:27,432
<i>He also attended Ana's wake.</i>

00:38:27,432 --> 00:38:28,867
She will not be forgotten.

00:38:28,867 --> 00:38:31,803
He must have bumped into
Claire again at the factory,

00:38:31,803 --> 00:38:35,040
and invited her back to
his studio as a kind of--

00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,008
I don't know--
replacement for Ana.

00:38:37,008 --> 00:38:38,743
Brass is on his way
to Garner's residence.

00:38:38,743 --> 00:38:39,945
I requested a ping
on his cell

00:38:39,945 --> 00:38:41,713
and a broadcast
on his vehicle.

00:38:41,713 --> 00:38:43,048
Hey, look at that.

00:38:43,048 --> 00:38:44,950
Ping came back on
Garner's cell phone.

00:38:47,752 --> 00:38:49,020
Look where he is.

00:38:50,522 --> 00:38:52,190
(grunting)

00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:54,559
GABRIEL:
I never should have let Ana
convince me to hire you!

00:38:54,559 --> 00:38:56,194
(coughing)
I'm so sorry.

00:38:56,194 --> 00:38:57,762
That I didn't
protect you, Ana.

00:38:57,762 --> 00:38:59,464
(wheezes, coughs)
That I didn't see...

00:38:59,464 --> 00:39:02,100
what this son of a bitch
was doing to you!

00:39:03,535 --> 00:39:06,771
No! You don't look at her!

00:39:06,771 --> 00:39:09,107
She was mine.

00:39:09,107 --> 00:39:10,876
I loved her.

00:39:10,876 --> 00:39:12,878
I just wanted to keep her.

00:39:12,878 --> 00:39:14,512
I just wanted her to need me.

00:39:14,512 --> 00:39:16,181
Shut up!
She loved me.

00:39:16,181 --> 00:39:17,749
(grunting)

00:39:17,749 --> 00:39:19,651
LVPD!
Put the gun down!

00:39:19,651 --> 00:39:21,519
Gabriel. All right,
all right, hey.

00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:23,488
Just relax. Everybody
just take a second here.

00:39:23,488 --> 00:39:24,489
You don't want to do this.

00:39:24,489 --> 00:39:25,590
Just put...

00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:26,825
put the weapon
down, all right?

00:39:26,825 --> 00:39:28,827
He killed her.
He killed my baby girl.

00:39:28,827 --> 00:39:30,829
All right, now, hey, hey,
don't do that. No, no.

00:39:30,829 --> 00:39:33,398
Don't you dare.
Don't you dare.
(gun chamber cocking)

00:39:33,398 --> 00:39:35,033
All right, everybody relax
just for a second.

00:39:35,033 --> 00:39:36,468
He took her from me!

00:39:36,468 --> 00:39:37,569
I know, all right, all right.

00:39:37,569 --> 00:39:38,570
Just-just listen to me

00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:40,071
for one second.

00:39:40,071 --> 00:39:43,475
You can still hear
Ana's voice, can't you?

00:39:43,475 --> 00:39:45,143
What is she telling you
to do right now?

00:39:48,647 --> 00:39:51,650
(crying)

00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:53,685
(sobbing)

00:39:59,891 --> 00:40:01,826
(groans)

00:40:01,826 --> 00:40:03,194
(crying)

00:40:05,397 --> 00:40:09,401
He took her.
All right.

00:40:09,401 --> 00:40:11,603
Just give me a minute
here, will you?

00:40:11,603 --> 00:40:13,138
My daughter.
You did the
right thing.

00:40:13,138 --> 00:40:14,606
You did the right thing.

00:40:14,606 --> 00:40:16,942
Your daughter would be
proud of you, Gabriel.

00:40:27,986 --> 00:40:29,921
(sniffing)

00:40:33,091 --> 00:40:34,859
(laughs)

00:40:34,859 --> 00:40:36,194
I thought you and Stokes took

00:40:36,194 --> 00:40:37,662
the first flight out
this morning.

00:40:37,662 --> 00:40:39,497
Oh, we decided to
take a later one.

00:40:39,497 --> 00:40:41,166
I went to the police
chief's office,

00:40:41,166 --> 00:40:44,769
and I told him how sorry we were
for invading his lovely city

00:40:44,769 --> 00:40:48,440
when the real killer was
a homegrown American monster.

00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,874
(laughs)

00:40:49,874 --> 00:40:51,676
You told him that?
Yeah, and

00:40:51,676 --> 00:40:54,646
I asked him to release Agent
Silva from jail, and it worked.

00:40:54,646 --> 00:40:56,481
Silva's a free man.

00:41:01,419 --> 00:41:02,821
<i>Gracias.</i>

00:41:02,821 --> 00:41:03,989
Thank you for
everything, Nick.

00:41:03,989 --> 00:41:05,991
You, too, Agent Silva.

00:41:05,991 --> 00:41:07,826
And, listen, if you're ever
headed Vegas way,

00:41:07,826 --> 00:41:09,794
you got to look me up,
all right?

00:41:09,794 --> 00:41:11,629
Will do.
Okay.

00:41:11,629 --> 00:41:14,733
But keep your crazy gambles to
the casinos for a while, hey?

00:41:14,733 --> 00:41:16,001
I'll try.

00:41:22,574 --> 00:41:24,075
<i>Vamos.</i>

00:41:24,075 --> 00:41:25,410
STOKES:
<i>Hasta luego.</i>

00:41:28,713 --> 00:41:31,616
You took a big risk...
sticking around,

00:41:31,616 --> 00:41:34,452
going to meet
that police chief. (laughs)

00:41:34,452 --> 00:41:37,188
He's a dangerous man.

00:41:37,188 --> 00:41:39,557
It was the right thing to do.

00:41:39,557 --> 00:41:42,027
Which is something you don't
see too much of around here.

00:41:44,829 --> 00:41:46,865
I want you to have these tools.

00:41:46,865 --> 00:41:50,735
I realize you have a horrible
amount of use for them.

00:41:50,735 --> 00:41:52,003
<i>Gracias.</i>

00:41:52,003 --> 00:41:53,538
I really wish
I could do more to help,

00:41:53,538 --> 00:41:57,475
but I know
wishing's pretty useless.

00:41:57,475 --> 00:41:58,777
It's not useless.

00:41:58,777 --> 00:42:00,945
It's faith.

00:42:00,945 --> 00:42:02,514
<i>La fe.</i>
(laughs)

00:42:02,514 --> 00:42:04,416
We all need faith.

00:42:10,055 --> 00:42:11,790
<i>Vaya con dios, amigo.</i>

00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:13,792
<i>Vaya con dios, amigo.</i>

00:42:13,792 --> 00:42:15,093
(laughs)
