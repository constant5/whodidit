00:00:02,744 --> 00:00:06,781
STOKES:
<i>Some creatures are</i>
<i>more fortunate than humans are.</i>

00:00:06,781 --> 00:00:10,185
<i>Pheromones do</i>
<i>the crowd control,</i>

00:00:10,185 --> 00:00:12,787
<i>keep the mob moving</i>
<i>in an orderly fashion,</i>

00:00:12,787 --> 00:00:16,424
<i>even when panic sets in.</i>

00:00:16,424 --> 00:00:18,360
<i>We humans have no such gift.</i>

00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,763
(screaming, shouting)

00:00:21,763 --> 00:00:25,100
<i>It's every man for himself.</i>

00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,403
(screaming, coughing)

00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,376
Concert going on.

00:00:34,376 --> 00:00:37,145
Fire sent 'em all
running for the door.

00:00:37,145 --> 00:00:39,648
Just a kid.

00:00:39,648 --> 00:00:41,483
Any more bodies?

00:00:41,483 --> 00:00:44,219
Yeah, there's
three more inside.

00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:45,620
At least
the last thing

00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:48,190
he saw was a beautiful night.

00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:51,059
Through the smoke,
mob stomping all over him.

00:00:53,061 --> 00:00:54,696
Nice thought.

00:00:54,696 --> 00:00:56,798
WOMAN: Let me through!
RUSSELL:
No, hey, don't...

00:00:56,798 --> 00:00:59,167
don't let her...
Someone h--someone help my boy!

00:00:59,167 --> 00:01:01,102
He said he was
meeting friends and

00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:02,671
hearing some music.
I said I'd be here

00:01:02,671 --> 00:01:04,639
at midnight to pick him up.
Where are his friends?

00:01:04,639 --> 00:01:06,441
Where are his friends?
Who did this?

00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:08,076
Who did this to Kevin?

00:01:08,076 --> 00:01:09,778
Who did this to my son?

00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:11,646
(sobs)
Who did this to my boy?

00:01:11,646 --> 00:01:13,481
STOKES:
She's looking for answers.

00:01:13,481 --> 00:01:16,284
But it's nobody's fault
they were trying to survive.

00:01:18,019 --> 00:01:19,621
Human instinct.

00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:22,424
<i>Fire starts</i>
<i>and everything you need--</i>

00:01:22,424 --> 00:01:24,326

<i>is on the other side of a door.</i>

00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:29,064
Doesn't matter what's
in front of you.

00:01:29,064 --> 00:01:31,199
Even if it's your best friend.

00:01:34,402 --> 00:01:37,072

STOKES: All right, Russell
checked in with Brass

00:02:27,289 --> 00:02:29,090
and witnesses at the hospital.

00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:32,494
Finn, why don't you and I start
on this fire investigation.

00:02:32,494 --> 00:02:34,062
Okay.

00:02:34,062 --> 00:02:35,664
Yeah, we'll document
the victims.

00:02:35,664 --> 00:02:37,599
Sure.

00:02:39,734 --> 00:02:42,203
(distant siren wailing)

00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:50,278
Kevin Ellis. He's 18.

00:02:50,278 --> 00:02:51,546
He's a local.

00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:53,181
BRODY:
No burns.

00:02:53,181 --> 00:02:54,549
But a lot of soot.

00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:57,285
And multiple blunt-force trauma
to the face,

00:02:57,285 --> 00:02:58,486
the head...

00:02:58,486 --> 00:03:00,555
and the hands.

00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:02,324
Awful.

00:03:02,324 --> 00:03:03,758
I never
liked concerts.

00:03:03,758 --> 00:03:05,794
Just give me an iPod,
some headphones,

00:03:05,794 --> 00:03:08,229
a little personal space,
and I'm good.

00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:10,765
BRODY: Not me. The right
crowd, the right band.

00:03:10,765 --> 00:03:14,669
Closest thing I've ever come
to a religious experience.

00:03:20,642 --> 00:03:22,110
Dave.
Yeah?

00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,678
You mind if I pull his wallet?

00:03:23,678 --> 00:03:25,013
Yeah, go ahead.

00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:33,455
Timo Padia. 19.

00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,624
No burns on him, either.

00:03:36,624 --> 00:03:39,361
Looks like he took a hit
to the nose.

00:03:40,729 --> 00:03:43,064
There's petechiae in his eyes.

00:03:43,064 --> 00:03:44,566
He was asphyxiated.

00:03:44,566 --> 00:03:46,201
By the crowd? It doesn't...

00:03:46,201 --> 00:03:47,535
look like
he was trampled.

00:03:47,535 --> 00:03:49,070
Blood down his shirt says

00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:52,273
he was upright
when his nose was broken.

00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:54,476
No shoeprints on him.

00:03:54,476 --> 00:03:56,277
Crush asphyxiation

00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:59,180
can happen
when you're on your feet.

00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,582
<i>Pressure from other bodies</i>

00:04:00,582 --> 00:04:02,183
<i>prevents the lungs</i>
<i>from expanding,</i>

00:04:02,183 --> 00:04:04,552
<i>making it impossible</i>
<i>to breathe.</i>

00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:08,089
However the physics worked,

00:04:08,089 --> 00:04:09,624
this kid went through hell.

00:04:11,493 --> 00:04:14,429
(indistinct chatter)
(monitor beeping)

00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:25,273
RUSSELL:
Hey. Jim.

00:04:25,273 --> 00:04:29,043
Well...hell
of a thing, huh?

00:04:29,043 --> 00:04:31,579
It's the kind of news
that stops a parent's heart.

00:04:31,579 --> 00:04:33,281
We got a dozen
serious injuries,

00:04:33,281 --> 00:04:35,016
half of them critical.

00:04:35,016 --> 00:04:37,419
Along with, uh,
three unidentified.

00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:39,421
Including that guy.

00:04:41,423 --> 00:04:43,792
So, the club owner, he's sitting
over there in the black shirt.

00:04:43,792 --> 00:04:45,627
His name is Stu Kirchoff.

00:04:45,627 --> 00:04:48,129
He was bunkered in to his back
office when the fire broke out.

00:04:48,129 --> 00:04:49,464
Can't even remember
the name of the band.

00:04:49,464 --> 00:04:50,532
No one can.

00:04:50,532 --> 00:04:52,066
That's a little odd.
Well,

00:04:52,066 --> 00:04:53,768
the place is kind of
like amateur hour, you know?

00:04:53,768 --> 00:04:55,403
Kids sneak in booze,
get wasted

00:04:55,403 --> 00:04:58,373
and listen to some random band
rage onstage.

00:04:58,373 --> 00:05:00,275
Any witness videos, photos?

00:05:00,275 --> 00:05:02,143
Anything to help us
reconstruct?

00:05:02,143 --> 00:05:03,645
No. Not yet. Nothing.

00:05:03,645 --> 00:05:06,614
My kids use
their cell phone cameras

00:05:06,614 --> 00:05:08,716
like they're all-seeing eyes.
Maybe they think

00:05:08,716 --> 00:05:11,453
it's not too cool to share
their photos with cops.

00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:15,156
FINLAY: You know, I have to
admit, when I, uh,

00:05:15,156 --> 00:05:17,025
worked in Seattle,

00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:19,761
I didn't get a chance to do
many fire investigations.

00:05:19,761 --> 00:05:22,096
It's complicated.

00:05:22,096 --> 00:05:24,199
Really? Even for you?

00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,434
Someone who can paint
a whole knife fight

00:05:26,434 --> 00:05:28,269
from a few drops of blood?

00:05:28,269 --> 00:05:29,804
I think you'll be all right.

00:05:29,804 --> 00:05:31,306
All right. Where do we start?

00:05:31,306 --> 00:05:33,708
Our main goal is to find
the point of origin.

00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36,578
And a fire burns up
and out, right?

00:05:36,578 --> 00:05:39,781
So if we locate
the lowest point of damage,

00:05:39,781 --> 00:05:42,217
that should tell us
where the fire started.

00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:43,518
But...

00:05:45,487 --> 00:05:46,688
What?

00:05:46,688 --> 00:05:49,791
You see all this...
soundproof foam

00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:52,527
right here?
Yeah.

00:05:52,527 --> 00:05:54,462
All this caught fire

00:05:54,462 --> 00:05:57,232
and just rained down
all over the place.

00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:58,533
Creating

00:05:58,533 --> 00:06:00,468
many low points.

00:06:00,468 --> 00:06:02,170
Mmm.

00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,405
I bet it went up so fast
that's what caused the stampede.

00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:08,376
SIDLE:
Think this was the stage.

00:06:08,376 --> 00:06:10,678
Didn't want to leave
his axe behind.

00:06:10,678 --> 00:06:13,748
No wallet, no I.D.
on either of them.

00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:17,352
Just a few guitar picks

00:06:17,352 --> 00:06:19,287
on this one.

00:06:19,287 --> 00:06:21,222
I'm guessing...

00:06:21,222 --> 00:06:23,758
that makes her the bassist.

00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:26,227
Reddish skin tone suggests

00:06:26,227 --> 00:06:27,562
carbon monoxide poisoning.

00:06:27,562 --> 00:06:29,130
Smoke inhalation.

00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:31,466
Firefighters knocked in
the side door.

00:06:33,501 --> 00:06:35,570
How come these two didn't exit
through it?

00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:37,472
Maybe the smoke was too thick,
it was too dark

00:06:37,472 --> 00:06:38,673
and they couldn't see.

00:06:38,673 --> 00:06:40,208
Carbon monoxide poisoning

00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:41,676
also disorients

00:06:41,676 --> 00:06:43,711
and confuses long
before it kills.

00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:46,648
Band on the run may have been
all turned around.

00:07:12,574 --> 00:07:14,642
(beeping)

00:07:30,558 --> 00:07:33,194
You realize that this
was bound to happen.

00:07:33,194 --> 00:07:36,464
You covered the walls
with polyurethane foam.

00:07:36,464 --> 00:07:38,633
Went up like gasoline.

00:07:38,633 --> 00:07:41,436
No sprinklers,
no smoke alarms,

00:07:41,436 --> 00:07:43,137
empty fire extinguishers

00:07:43,137 --> 00:07:44,639
and only one exit.

00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,808
That's not true.
There's a...

00:07:46,808 --> 00:07:48,476
second one by
the stage.

00:07:48,476 --> 00:07:50,111
Which couldn't be opened.

00:07:50,111 --> 00:07:53,381
Evidence shows
that this victim

00:07:53,381 --> 00:07:55,650
tried to kick that door open.

00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:57,752
I sure as hell didn't lock it.

00:07:57,752 --> 00:07:59,287
Oh, I used to,

00:07:59,287 --> 00:08:01,022
to keep people
from sneaking in

00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:03,658
during the shows, but, uh...

00:08:03,658 --> 00:08:05,093
(sighs)

00:08:06,761 --> 00:08:09,364
Who are these people?

00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:12,233
SANDERS:
Well, we were hoping that you
might be able to help with that.

00:08:12,233 --> 00:08:14,502
They were in the band
that was playing.

00:08:17,105 --> 00:08:19,474
All right, there--there was
a guy that, uh...

00:08:19,474 --> 00:08:21,809
was the lead vocals,
played the guitar.

00:08:21,809 --> 00:08:23,478
Another guy on the drums.

00:08:23,478 --> 00:08:25,013
And the gal on bass.

00:08:26,781 --> 00:08:28,449
That's all you know?
Look,

00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:29,751
these groups, they come to me,

00:08:29,751 --> 00:08:31,552
ask to play, I let 'em.

00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:33,588
But the music...

00:08:33,588 --> 00:08:35,590
...got lost on me years ago.

00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:38,593
Nevertheless,
kids would line up,

00:08:38,593 --> 00:08:42,664
pay ten bucks,
come in, let loose.

00:08:42,664 --> 00:08:45,299
That's just the way
it's been for...

00:08:45,299 --> 00:08:47,335
30 years now at that club.

00:08:47,335 --> 00:08:49,804
Well, speaking
of club history,

00:08:49,804 --> 00:08:53,074
my colleagues found
some recent online photos

00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:55,576
of the Lockjaw Club's
interior,

00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:58,680
to aid with reconstruction.

00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,648
Noticed something missing.

00:09:00,648 --> 00:09:02,517
Must've been
a pretty sweet guitar

00:09:02,517 --> 00:09:03,718
to get that kind of treatment.

00:09:03,718 --> 00:09:06,154
You know who gave me
that guitar?

00:09:06,154 --> 00:09:07,588
Stevie Ray Vaughan.

00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:10,692
Yeah, he did a spot
for me back in '85.

00:09:10,692 --> 00:09:13,428
Blew the roof and the doors
right off of the joint.

00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:14,662
So why wasn't it

00:09:14,662 --> 00:09:16,197
there tonight?

00:09:16,197 --> 00:09:19,067
Oh.

00:09:19,067 --> 00:09:21,736
About a month or so ago,

00:09:21,736 --> 00:09:25,173
I... I pawned it.

00:09:27,241 --> 00:09:31,679
I had to keep the power on
somehow.

00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:34,749
Yeah, if it wasn't
for that cash, uh...

00:09:34,749 --> 00:09:37,151
club would've been closed
tonight.

00:09:58,039 --> 00:10:00,241
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:10:00,241 --> 00:10:03,544
And without a stack
of old <i>National Geographics,</i>

00:10:03,544 --> 00:10:06,013
like a proper doctor.

00:10:06,013 --> 00:10:07,548
David's still prepping
the last victim,

00:10:07,548 --> 00:10:09,517
but here's what we have so far.

00:10:09,517 --> 00:10:13,020
Kevin Ellis. C.O.D.'s
intracerebral hemorrhage

00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,123
due to multiple
blunt force trauma.

00:10:15,123 --> 00:10:17,692
Steel-toed boots
may be the punk style,

00:10:17,692 --> 00:10:21,028
but they definitely
clashed with his skull.

00:10:21,028 --> 00:10:23,231
Tox showed he had a very high
blood alcohol level.

00:10:23,231 --> 00:10:25,133
Could've made him lose balance
in the stampede.

00:10:25,133 --> 00:10:28,569
Did you also get a panel
on our John Doe musician?

00:10:28,569 --> 00:10:30,271
Yep.

00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,539
This discoloration

00:10:31,539 --> 00:10:34,108
certainly suggests
carbon monoxide.

00:10:34,108 --> 00:10:36,277
BRODY:
Along with a toxic chaser.

00:10:36,277 --> 00:10:38,579
Hydrogen cyanide.

00:10:38,579 --> 00:10:41,015
Same stuff used
in execution chambers.

00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,383
Produced, in this case,

00:10:42,383 --> 00:10:45,386
by the burning polyurethane foam
on the walls.

00:10:45,386 --> 00:10:49,557
Well, on this
three-act bill...

00:10:49,557 --> 00:10:52,527
the last C.O.D.'s
the real surprise.

00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:55,663
Timo Padia,
ligature strangulation.

00:10:55,663 --> 00:10:57,532
Choked by a chain.

00:10:57,532 --> 00:10:59,700
I, uh,
used your I.R. camera,

00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,736
saw the pattern.

00:11:01,736 --> 00:11:04,405
So...he was murdered.

00:11:04,405 --> 00:11:05,773
Before the fire?

00:11:05,773 --> 00:11:07,675
I didn't find any soot
in his lungs.

00:11:07,675 --> 00:11:10,111
But I did find this.

00:11:10,111 --> 00:11:11,646
Some sort of
granular material

00:11:11,646 --> 00:11:14,649
lodged in his trachea.

00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:16,184
(clattering)

00:11:16,184 --> 00:11:18,286
Sorry.
Is something wrong,
David?

00:11:18,286 --> 00:11:20,188
Uh...
(sighs)

00:11:20,188 --> 00:11:22,356
It's just that female decedent
that I'm prepping...

00:11:22,356 --> 00:11:24,559
Jane Doe Bassist?

00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:27,161
You guys really need
to see this.

00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:43,444
Wow.

00:11:43,444 --> 00:11:45,479
There are even more
under the sheet.

00:11:45,479 --> 00:11:46,714
BRODY:
An Hispanic kid

00:11:46,714 --> 00:11:49,050
is strangled to death
with a chain

00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:51,586
while a racist rocks out
onstage?

00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:53,721
What the hell kind
of show was this?

00:11:53,721 --> 00:11:56,157
(beeping)

00:12:24,218 --> 00:12:25,419
(beeping)

00:12:33,194 --> 00:12:35,096
(punk music playing)

00:12:58,085 --> 00:13:01,289
Our female victim's
name is Rene Nylen. 21.

00:13:01,289 --> 00:13:02,723
Local. She was a bassist

00:13:02,723 --> 00:13:04,792
in a hatecore band
called White Rising.

00:13:04,792 --> 00:13:06,294
"Hatecore."

00:13:06,294 --> 00:13:07,795
Music for white supremacists,
right?

00:13:07,795 --> 00:13:10,097
Yeah. Underground scene
with a national presence.

00:13:10,097 --> 00:13:11,299
Lots of anthems for

00:13:11,299 --> 00:13:13,334
angry young bigots.
Here...

00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,369
is some video from
a recent White Rising show.

00:13:15,369 --> 00:13:17,705
(punk music playing)

00:13:17,705 --> 00:13:19,307
I couldn't
find the names

00:13:19,307 --> 00:13:21,275
of the other band members,
but I'm guessing

00:13:21,275 --> 00:13:24,278
that the masked front man
is our John Doe Musician.

00:13:24,278 --> 00:13:26,647
And I'm guessing that's why
our club owner was so forgetful

00:13:26,647 --> 00:13:28,249
about the band he'd booked.

00:13:28,249 --> 00:13:30,017
Admit to letting these guys
take the stage,

00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:32,353
some might say
you deserved the fire.

00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:37,224
But what was Timo Padia doing
at a White Power "hatenanny"?

00:13:37,224 --> 00:13:39,193
Maybe someone asked
that same question.

00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:41,228
Then did something about it,
killed him.

00:13:41,228 --> 00:13:44,031
Yeah, and someone adds fire
to the fury.

00:13:50,071 --> 00:13:53,040
All right. Thanks.

00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,376
Brass spoke to one
of the hospitalized witnesses.

00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,578
Evidently, they saw Timo Padia
enter the club

00:13:57,578 --> 00:14:00,381
with a blonde girl.
They were holding hands.

00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:02,316
He was a little drunk
and flirty.

00:14:02,316 --> 00:14:05,219
But once Timo heard the music,
he sobered up quick.

00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:07,288
And where's this girl now?

00:14:07,288 --> 00:14:08,622
She hasn't come forward.

00:14:08,622 --> 00:14:10,591
All right.
So maybe...

00:14:10,591 --> 00:14:12,560
one of these hatecore fans,

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,761
pumped up on the music,

00:14:13,761 --> 00:14:15,196
goes after Padia,

00:14:15,196 --> 00:14:16,564
kills him

00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:18,199
and starts the fire
to cover it up.

00:14:18,199 --> 00:14:20,034
I just got a
text from Hodges.

00:14:20,034 --> 00:14:22,169
He said the trace they found
in Timo Padia's throat

00:14:22,169 --> 00:14:25,106
is actually
crushed limestone.

00:14:25,106 --> 00:14:26,674
Which I'm guessing
he swallowed somehow

00:14:26,674 --> 00:14:28,509
while he was being choked.

00:14:28,509 --> 00:14:30,411
I didn't find any material
like that at the body.

00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:32,346
But, you know what,
it's worth a look around.

00:14:32,346 --> 00:14:35,416
Maybe we can find exactly
where Padia was attacked.

00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:51,565
Fire didn't touch
this storeroom.

00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:59,173
Morgan.

00:15:00,374 --> 00:15:02,676
Blood drops. Gravitational.

00:15:05,146 --> 00:15:06,714
BRODY:
Got more blood here.

00:15:06,714 --> 00:15:09,650
Double-line pattern.

00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:10,785
That's odd.

00:15:15,423 --> 00:15:18,259
Look, there were scratches
on Timo Padia's boots.

00:15:22,396 --> 00:15:24,632
Timo Padia was killed in here.

00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,100
(choking)

00:15:28,369 --> 00:15:29,770
SIDLE:
<i>Dragged out.</i>

00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:32,139
<i>And then dumped</i>
<i>on the dance floor.</i>

00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:35,242
And then the killer
set fire to the place.

00:15:35,242 --> 00:15:37,278
One crime leads to another.

00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:40,114
(siren chirping)

00:15:40,114 --> 00:15:41,582
(helicopter flying over)

00:15:41,582 --> 00:15:43,451
Hey, could you give me
a hand with this?

00:15:43,451 --> 00:15:46,153
(clanging)

00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:47,521
What is it?

00:15:47,521 --> 00:15:49,323
(grunts)
I want to check
out this door.

00:15:51,792 --> 00:15:55,029
Yep. The door was not locked.

00:15:55,029 --> 00:15:56,764
Then why couldn't the band
get out of it?

00:15:56,764 --> 00:15:59,266
Exactly.

00:15:59,266 --> 00:16:02,169
Fresh paint scrapings
embedded on the outside.

00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:04,672
Something was
blocking that door.
Yep.

00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:07,074
Heard Nick Stokes and a friend
were making a mess of my scene.

00:16:08,209 --> 00:16:10,044
Ryan. Miller.

00:16:10,044 --> 00:16:11,245
Fire Investigator.

00:16:11,245 --> 00:16:13,080
Finn. Hey.

00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,315
So, uh...

00:16:14,315 --> 00:16:16,150
what are we looking at?

00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:19,320
Uh, we're still looking
for the point of origin.
Yeah?

00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,490
Yeah. Ryan, why don't you, uh,
come over here? Check this out.

00:16:24,325 --> 00:16:28,295
Uh, I think this is
what received the most damage.

00:16:28,295 --> 00:16:30,631
Hey, Stokes,
I'll tell you what, man.
What's that?

00:16:30,631 --> 00:16:33,701
I don't mind you invading
my scene when you bring
a partner who looks like that.

00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:35,102
What do you mean?

00:16:35,102 --> 00:16:36,237
You know.

00:16:41,075 --> 00:16:42,610
Ah, here you go.

00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:44,778
Look at this, man. Hey, uh,

00:16:44,778 --> 00:16:46,480
Finn, want to come
take a look at this?

00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,715
FINLAY:
Sure.

00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:50,384
See, these springs
are annealed.

00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:51,685
FINLAY:
Annealed?

00:16:51,685 --> 00:16:53,254
Yeah, a certain threshold
of heat,

00:16:53,254 --> 00:16:55,122
springs lose their tension
and they, uh,

00:16:55,122 --> 00:16:56,657
collapse like this.

00:16:56,657 --> 00:16:59,293
But you only hit that threshold

00:16:59,293 --> 00:17:00,728
if you add an extra combustible.

00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:04,031
Like what?
Gasoline, Sterno, butane.

00:17:04,031 --> 00:17:06,534
Whatever the arsonist's
particular appetite calls for.

00:17:06,534 --> 00:17:08,736
FINLAY: So you're assuming
that it's arson?

00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,738
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:13,207
Someone doused this bench,
lit it up.

00:17:13,207 --> 00:17:16,043
Well, then you should
get me a shot of that.

00:17:16,043 --> 00:17:18,179
(chuckling):
No, bro.

00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:20,381
Let me get my real camera
from the truck.

00:17:20,381 --> 00:17:21,782
Digital's got no soul.

00:17:21,782 --> 00:17:23,350
(chuckles)

00:17:24,451 --> 00:17:25,753
He's kind of obnoxious.

00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:28,155
He's also very old-school.

00:17:28,155 --> 00:17:30,724
He's been taught
by old-school guys.

00:17:30,724 --> 00:17:32,426
When it comes to
a fire investigation,

00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:35,229
some of those pages have been
ripped out of the book.

00:17:35,229 --> 00:17:37,464
A lot of things have been
disproved--case in point,

00:17:37,464 --> 00:17:39,200
annealed springs simply

00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,135
indicate that the springs...

00:17:41,135 --> 00:17:42,703
got hot.

00:17:42,703 --> 00:17:44,505
He likes to jump to conclusions.
RYAN:
Oh, chief,

00:17:44,505 --> 00:17:47,041
you got
your hydrocarbon detector?
Yeah.

00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,576
I tell you what.
I'll trade with you.

00:17:48,576 --> 00:17:50,177
There you go.
Give this thing a try.

00:17:50,177 --> 00:17:52,346
Thanks, man. All right,
this is gonna tell us

00:17:52,346 --> 00:17:55,082
which type of accelerant
the arsonist used.

00:17:56,183 --> 00:17:58,085
(quiet electronic crackling)

00:18:03,023 --> 00:18:05,092
(sensor beeping rapidly)

00:18:05,092 --> 00:18:06,694
Hit. Five-foot radius.
All right.

00:18:12,099 --> 00:18:13,234
(Stokes coughs)

00:18:15,169 --> 00:18:17,504
Hello, sweetheart.

00:18:17,504 --> 00:18:21,108
Piece of cardboard
with a candle attached.

00:18:21,108 --> 00:18:22,443
Let me see that.

00:18:27,047 --> 00:18:28,682
Incendiary device.

00:18:28,682 --> 00:18:32,653
We found a few things
in your son's pockets.

00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,488
Wallet and keys.

00:18:41,362 --> 00:18:44,798
Kevin's grandpa gave him this
when he... (sniffles)

00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:46,600
for his eighth birthday.

00:18:51,372 --> 00:18:53,674
I hope you find peace,
Mrs. Ellis.

00:18:55,476 --> 00:18:58,145
This officer's gonna
show you to your car.

00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,689
(sighs)
BRASS:
Does she have any idea

00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:12,026
what kind of band
her son was going to see?

00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:15,596
What kind of racist, violent
crowd he was hanging out with?

00:19:17,064 --> 00:19:18,365
I don't think so, no.

00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:20,301
Maybe that's good.

00:19:20,301 --> 00:19:23,804
So, this band White Rising--
they made a kind of Top 40.

00:19:23,804 --> 00:19:25,205
They made the FBI

00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:26,707
Hate Group Watch-List.

00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,676
The local office
tossed me their file.

00:19:28,676 --> 00:19:32,313
I.D. on our masked singer--
Kurt Harper.

00:19:32,313 --> 00:19:34,181
Definitely played
the club before.

00:19:34,181 --> 00:19:37,217
They only left one body
behind last time.

00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:39,119
Three months ago,
White Rising played

00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:40,487
a gig at The Lockjaw Club.

00:19:40,487 --> 00:19:43,490
Now, outside the club,
in an adjacent parking lot,

00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:46,060
a group of Asian-American kids
were skateboarding.

00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,261
So, the show let out

00:19:47,261 --> 00:19:49,396
and some of the
skinhead thugs let loose

00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:51,498
and beat one of the
skateboarders into a coma.

00:19:51,498 --> 00:19:54,268
Lee Wong Jr., 17 years old.

00:19:54,268 --> 00:19:55,469
Assailants got away?

00:19:55,469 --> 00:19:56,770
Yeah, they blended
right back

00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:58,372
into the all-white crowd.

00:19:58,372 --> 00:20:00,574
So the Feds took
a picture of Kurt Harper

00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:02,042
and showed it
to the vic's friends,

00:20:02,042 --> 00:20:03,410
hoping to get an I.D.,

00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,579
but none of them could
identify him as an attacker.

00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:08,148
No, he's just the guy
who got the attackers

00:20:08,148 --> 00:20:10,484
amped up and
ready for blood.

00:20:10,484 --> 00:20:13,053
Well, to the question
of whether the stiff

00:20:13,053 --> 00:20:15,022
that's lying horizontal
in our morgue

00:20:15,022 --> 00:20:17,624
is Kurt Harper,
permanently silenced,

00:20:17,624 --> 00:20:19,760
the feds did
a dental comparison.

00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,161
And it's a match.

00:20:21,161 --> 00:20:23,497
Okay, well,
that settles that.

00:20:23,497 --> 00:20:27,334
Front man and the bass
player are both dead.

00:20:27,334 --> 00:20:28,602
The drummer vanished.

00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,337
Does it say anywhere in here

00:20:30,337 --> 00:20:33,040
whether or not the band had
any particular enemies?

00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,441
Nick found an
incendiary device,

00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:36,343
so we're looking at arson.

00:20:36,343 --> 00:20:38,112
No specific grudges, no.

00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:39,747
Okay.

00:20:39,747 --> 00:20:42,015
When you fling enough crap
into the universe,

00:20:42,015 --> 00:20:44,485
occasionally the breeze
is going to blow your way.

00:20:48,322 --> 00:20:50,424
Trace you scraped from the
outside of the club doors--

00:20:50,424 --> 00:20:52,326
stock Pontiac red paint.

00:20:52,326 --> 00:20:54,094
Used since the early '90s.

00:20:54,094 --> 00:20:56,263
So there was a red Pontiac
blocking the door?

00:20:56,263 --> 00:20:58,499
Well, there wasn't one
on the scene when we arrived.

00:20:58,499 --> 00:21:01,502
Okay, how are you doing
with the incendiary device?

00:21:01,502 --> 00:21:03,804
GCMS revealed traces
of gasoline on the cardboard.

00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:06,106
Confirms arson.
Yeah, and since
I'm full-service,

00:21:06,106 --> 00:21:07,408
I didn't stop with the gas.

00:21:07,408 --> 00:21:08,776
I noticed this barcode.

00:21:08,776 --> 00:21:10,277
<i>Ran it.</i>

00:21:10,277 --> 00:21:12,146
Cardboard's from
a box of auto parts

00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:13,647
delivered to a local mechanic--

00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,282
Lee Wong Automotive.

00:21:16,717 --> 00:21:18,218
That can't be
a coincidence.

00:21:18,218 --> 00:21:20,187
What do you mean?
Brass worked a case

00:21:20,187 --> 00:21:22,556
a few months ago where this
kid was beaten half to death,

00:21:22,556 --> 00:21:24,191
put in a coma.

00:21:24,191 --> 00:21:26,660
His name was Lee Wong, Jr.

00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,495
Sounds like more than arson.

00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:30,597
Yeah, it sounds like revenge.

00:21:34,468 --> 00:21:37,371
Thank you for coming down, Nora.
I appreciate it.

00:21:37,371 --> 00:21:39,506
This article
about the assault

00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:43,043
on your brother--
you were pretty vocal.

00:21:43,043 --> 00:21:44,645
Lee couldn't speak for himself.

00:21:44,645 --> 00:21:47,047
Still can't.

00:21:47,047 --> 00:21:48,615
Might never.

00:21:48,615 --> 00:21:50,284
Yeah, I heard that.

00:21:50,284 --> 00:21:53,720
I'm...very sorry.

00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,657
Fact that his assailants
were never identified--

00:21:56,657 --> 00:21:59,393
boy that...that must have
been frustrating.

00:22:01,094 --> 00:22:03,397
What kind of car
do you drive, Nora?

00:22:05,232 --> 00:22:06,567
Jeep.

00:22:06,567 --> 00:22:08,635
My dad's. He passed away.

00:22:08,635 --> 00:22:11,338
But you--you do run
the family auto shop, right?

00:22:11,338 --> 00:22:13,173
So, you'd probably
get your hands

00:22:13,173 --> 00:22:15,476
on any kind of car
you wanted, like a...

00:22:15,476 --> 00:22:17,311
red Pontiac, maybe?

00:22:17,311 --> 00:22:19,313
I drive a Jeep.

00:22:19,313 --> 00:22:21,582
What does this have to do
with my brother's beating?

00:22:21,582 --> 00:22:25,085
Well, the band that inspired
your brother's beating returned

00:22:25,085 --> 00:22:27,588
to that same club last night,
but then, you know that,

00:22:27,588 --> 00:22:30,724
don't you, because
you were there?

00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:33,026
Took a candle,

00:22:33,026 --> 00:22:35,262
scrap of cardboard
from your shop,

00:22:35,262 --> 00:22:39,766
you doused it in some gasoline,
and you set the club on fire.

00:22:39,766 --> 00:22:42,603
And you killed
three people, Nora.

00:22:42,603 --> 00:22:45,472
I thought I was here to learn
who ruined my brother's life.

00:22:45,472 --> 00:22:48,509
Instead,
you're accusing me of...

00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:56,283
You're wrong.

00:22:56,283 --> 00:22:58,752
Two days after the attack
of my brother,

00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:02,689
I brought some friends
to the place where it happened.

00:23:02,689 --> 00:23:05,526
I made sky lanterns.

00:23:05,526 --> 00:23:10,230
Cardboard, candle,
paper balloon.

00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:13,333
We lit them and watched them
float up,

00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:15,135
thinking of Lee.

00:23:17,738 --> 00:23:21,108
One or two landed
on the roof of that club.

00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:22,543
Maybe there was gas
on the cardboard

00:23:22,543 --> 00:23:24,344
from the floor of the shop.

00:23:24,344 --> 00:23:27,281
But that was months ago.

00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:29,683
They didn't start
a fire then,

00:23:29,683 --> 00:23:31,251
or last night.

00:23:35,155 --> 00:23:38,425
Looks like the grieving
sister's story makes sense.

00:23:38,425 --> 00:23:40,527
Yeah, that sky lantern

00:23:40,527 --> 00:23:42,129
landed on the roof,

00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:43,363
stays up there
a couple months,

00:23:43,363 --> 00:23:44,565
then comes down in here

00:23:44,565 --> 00:23:46,133
when that part
of the roof collapsed.

00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:48,135
And we still have
no point of origin,

00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:50,370
which means
we are nowhere.

00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:52,539
Okay, there's a, uh...

00:23:52,539 --> 00:23:54,374
a new technique
that I learned recently

00:23:54,374 --> 00:23:56,310
when it comes to fire
that I'd like to try out here.

00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,644
Are you up for it?

00:23:57,644 --> 00:23:59,546
Sure.
It's called
arc mapping.

00:23:59,546 --> 00:24:02,349
Now, during a fire,
the insulation around the wiring

00:24:02,349 --> 00:24:03,717
in the walls melts away.

00:24:03,717 --> 00:24:05,519
<i>Once that happens,</i>

00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:09,222
<i>the bare wires then</i>
<i>short-circuit or arc,</i>

00:24:09,222 --> 00:24:12,025
<i>leaving behind</i>
<i>these distinct little beads</i>

00:24:12,025 --> 00:24:13,360
<i>at each point of an arc.</i>

00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,663
Now, no power can flow
through that arc,

00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:20,033
so if you map out
the arc locations,

00:24:20,033 --> 00:24:22,669
and compare it against
the building's circuitry,

00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:25,672
you should be able to figure out
which wire burnt first.

00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:27,407
And hopefully,
where the fire started.

00:24:27,407 --> 00:24:28,609
Exactly.

00:24:28,609 --> 00:24:30,010
Where do we start?

00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,478
Well, we start

00:24:31,478 --> 00:24:34,114
by checking the wiring
in the walls for arcs.

00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:38,585
RYAN:
Did I miss something?

00:24:38,585 --> 00:24:40,287
Did you forget where the point
of origin was, Stokes?

00:24:40,287 --> 00:24:41,788
You know, I could have, uh...

00:24:41,788 --> 00:24:43,457
could've written it on
a Post-it note for you.

00:24:43,457 --> 00:24:45,392
Actually, that theory
has been disproven,

00:24:45,392 --> 00:24:47,327
so, we're still investigating.

00:24:47,327 --> 00:24:48,595
Looks more like
you're remodeling.
STOKES:
No.

00:24:48,595 --> 00:24:50,397
No, actually, we are
still investigating.

00:24:50,397 --> 00:24:51,598
We were thinking about

00:24:51,598 --> 00:24:53,233
just arc-mapping
the whole building.

00:24:53,233 --> 00:24:55,268
No. No, bro, not arc-mapping.

00:24:55,268 --> 00:24:57,137
I'm not trying to make
you look bad, chief.

00:24:57,137 --> 00:24:59,806
You guys are going
about this all wrong.

00:24:59,806 --> 00:25:02,209
Leave...
FINLAY:
You know what?

00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:04,378
We're gonna continue working.

00:25:04,378 --> 00:25:08,248
So you're just gonna do
this on your own, huh?

00:25:08,248 --> 00:25:10,550
That's what we're gonna do.

00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:14,021
Okay. Let's see
how that works out for you.

00:25:14,021 --> 00:25:15,222
Have fun.

00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:16,356
Thanks, chief.

00:25:51,324 --> 00:25:54,428
(electrical buzzing)

00:25:59,232 --> 00:26:04,638
Here's where the fire started,
making this arc number one.

00:26:04,638 --> 00:26:06,039
Good.

00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:07,274
Hey, guys.

00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:08,508
How's it going?
FINLAY:
Good.

00:26:08,508 --> 00:26:10,143
We just found
the point of origin.

00:26:13,013 --> 00:26:14,448
Did he call you?

00:26:14,448 --> 00:26:16,349
Wanted to get us in trouble
with the sheriff?

00:26:16,349 --> 00:26:18,785
Oh...Miller's a good guy.

00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:20,454
Smart investigator. I mean,

00:26:20,454 --> 00:26:22,022
yeah, he had a few concerns.

00:26:22,022 --> 00:26:24,091
Well, we had a few concerns
about him.

00:26:24,091 --> 00:26:25,592
Nick obviously

00:26:25,592 --> 00:26:27,160
knows his science.

00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,029
That guy was all about his ego.

00:26:29,029 --> 00:26:31,164
I tried to be fair
with him, Conrad.

00:26:31,164 --> 00:26:33,133
Four people dead,
a dozen more burnt all over.

00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:34,468
I don't give a damn
about fair, Nick.

00:26:34,468 --> 00:26:36,036
Just show me you're right.

00:26:36,036 --> 00:26:37,738
We deduced that the fire had
to have started

00:26:37,738 --> 00:26:39,439
in this corner.
I think

00:26:39,439 --> 00:26:41,742
all we need to do now
is dig through this rubble

00:26:41,742 --> 00:26:43,210
and see what we can find.

00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:45,178
All right, all right, okay.

00:26:45,178 --> 00:26:46,680
What are we waiting for?
Let's do it.

00:26:51,284 --> 00:26:53,120
You tracked it down?

00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,621
The Red Pontiac of Doom.

00:26:54,621 --> 00:26:56,757
Had to have been at
the club during the fire,

00:26:56,757 --> 00:26:58,725
but gone when
the fire department arrived.

00:26:58,725 --> 00:27:00,494
It's a tight time-frame.
Not much traffic.

00:27:00,494 --> 00:27:02,129
I checked the cams.

00:27:02,129 --> 00:27:04,264
There you go--the only
red Pontiac around,

00:27:04,264 --> 00:27:05,532
headed away from the venue.

00:27:05,532 --> 00:27:07,634
Paint looks charred
from the heat.

00:27:07,634 --> 00:27:09,736
Can't make out
the driver's face, though.

00:27:09,736 --> 00:27:11,304
DMV any help
with the plate?

00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,408
Driver is a Northtown resident

00:27:15,408 --> 00:27:17,477
named Jeremy Douglass.

00:27:17,477 --> 00:27:21,681
Haven't seen my car in, like...

00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:23,250
24 hours.

00:27:25,452 --> 00:27:26,653
That's not me driving.

00:27:26,653 --> 00:27:28,555
Look, you already
told us

00:27:28,555 --> 00:27:31,191
that you were at
that skinhead show last night.

00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:32,626
This is your car,

00:27:32,626 --> 00:27:34,394
driving away from it.
What are you saying?

00:27:34,394 --> 00:27:37,264
That one of your friendly
Aryan brothers swiped it?

00:27:37,264 --> 00:27:40,767
Saying, whatever my--
my car

00:27:40,767 --> 00:27:42,502
might have been...

00:27:42,502 --> 00:27:44,070
involved in...

00:27:45,772 --> 00:27:47,240
I didn't have anything
to do with it.

00:27:48,742 --> 00:27:50,243
So, uh,

00:27:50,243 --> 00:27:51,478
what...what, uh...
what--what...

00:27:51,478 --> 00:27:53,146
what might it have been
involved in?

00:27:53,146 --> 00:27:54,748
SANDERS: It was parked in
an alley, blocking

00:27:54,748 --> 00:27:56,349
the exit door from the club,

00:27:56,349 --> 00:27:58,351
trapping the club-goers inside
during the fire.

00:27:58,351 --> 00:28:01,121
Four of them died.

00:28:01,121 --> 00:28:03,023
Something about that
coming back to you?

00:28:10,163 --> 00:28:12,165
He asked me to borrow it.

00:28:12,165 --> 00:28:13,667
My car.

00:28:13,667 --> 00:28:15,435
Texted me, in the middle
of the concert.

00:28:18,271 --> 00:28:20,073
"Leave your car in the alley,
keys in it.

00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:21,508
Right now. Walk away."

00:28:21,508 --> 00:28:23,443
Who's Caleb Voigt?

00:28:23,443 --> 00:28:25,078
A guy.

00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:26,746
Asks for your car,
and you just give it to him?

00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:29,149
Well, he's--he's not the kind
of guy you say no to.

00:28:29,149 --> 00:28:31,051
Dude's like half pit bull,

00:28:31,051 --> 00:28:33,653
and--and...and breaks rocks
for a living.

00:28:33,653 --> 00:28:35,689
Breaks rocks?

00:28:35,689 --> 00:28:38,558
What, like...limestone?

00:28:38,558 --> 00:28:40,360
Sure, I guess.

00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,262
Why?
Because he left

00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:44,264
some of it on the kid
he choked to death at the club.

00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:46,766
A murder for which you
provided the getaway car.

00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:49,569
Whoa, whoa. No, no, no, it--it
wasn't like that. I didn't know.

00:28:49,569 --> 00:28:51,104
SIDLE:
Maybe you didn't know,

00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:53,039
but this Caleb guy
took out one person.

00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:55,742
You took out three people
with your stupid parking job.

00:29:15,595 --> 00:29:16,763
Found something.

00:29:19,099 --> 00:29:20,333
Cigarette

00:29:20,333 --> 00:29:23,270
and matches,
rubber-banded together.

00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:26,373
Whoa.

00:29:26,373 --> 00:29:28,375
Hey, Conrad, how much you want
to bet, the arsonist

00:29:28,375 --> 00:29:30,343
didn't expect that
to survive the fire?

00:29:30,343 --> 00:29:32,579
How much you want to bet they
didn't expect a couple of CSIs

00:29:32,579 --> 00:29:35,382
to rip the walls
down to find it?

00:29:35,382 --> 00:29:36,683
Nice work, guys.

00:29:36,683 --> 00:29:38,084
Mr. Douglass,

00:29:38,084 --> 00:29:39,519
I'm Sheriff Ecklie.

00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:41,021
We're gonna
give you a chance

00:29:41,021 --> 00:29:43,323
to do yourself a
ten-to-15 year favor.

00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:49,062
<i>It's a microphone.</i>

00:29:49,062 --> 00:29:51,164
<i>Looks no different</i>
<i>than a cell phone, so, you do</i>

00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:53,199
your job right,
Caleb Voigt

00:29:53,199 --> 00:29:55,402
doesn't know any different,
and you come out

00:29:55,402 --> 00:29:57,704
in one piece.

00:30:06,246 --> 00:30:07,781
Car's out back.

00:30:07,781 --> 00:30:09,716
Key's in it.

00:30:09,716 --> 00:30:12,118
Cool.

00:30:12,118 --> 00:30:13,586
What's Voigt working on?

00:30:13,586 --> 00:30:17,424
Looks like he's cleaning
some equipment with acid.

00:30:17,424 --> 00:30:18,758
SANDERS:
<i>We need to get Caleb Voigt</i>

00:30:18,758 --> 00:30:21,294
to connect himself
to our evidence.

00:30:21,294 --> 00:30:24,297
That could be
the limestone debris.

00:30:24,297 --> 00:30:27,634
How--how, uh...how--how...
how's work been?

00:30:30,337 --> 00:30:32,372
What the hell do you care?

00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:34,040
Just--just like, uh,

00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,409
what--what kind of jobs
you been doing?

00:30:36,409 --> 00:30:39,446
What--what kind of materials
you working with?

00:30:39,446 --> 00:30:41,114
Don't hit me up for work,
all right?

00:30:41,114 --> 00:30:42,582
You couldn't handle it.

00:30:42,582 --> 00:30:44,584
SANDERS:
<i>Or...</i>

00:30:44,584 --> 00:30:46,219
we connect him
to the murder weapon.

00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:49,489
A chain, approximately
a half-inch wide.

00:30:49,489 --> 00:30:52,158
Caleb wears a chain like that
on his wallet.

00:30:52,158 --> 00:30:54,027
SIDLE: Good.
Keep an eye out for it.

00:30:54,027 --> 00:30:56,429
Whether he's wearing it,
or maybe he tossed it somewhere.

00:30:58,598 --> 00:31:00,433
Uh, listen.

00:31:00,433 --> 00:31:02,135
I'm a...I'm a little short.

00:31:02,135 --> 00:31:05,372
Could--could you loan me
a few bucks? If--If your...

00:31:05,372 --> 00:31:07,173
If your...if your
wallet's around?

00:31:07,173 --> 00:31:08,308
That was subtle.

00:31:09,376 --> 00:31:10,543
That ain't happening.

00:31:10,543 --> 00:31:11,745
But I leant you my car.

00:31:11,745 --> 00:31:13,446
I--I had to walk
all the way here.

00:31:13,446 --> 00:31:14,781
SANDERS:
<i>Or</i>

00:31:14,781 --> 00:31:16,449
we link him to the cigarette
and matches

00:31:16,449 --> 00:31:18,051
that were used
to start the fire.

00:31:18,051 --> 00:31:20,453
Do you know
if Caleb smokes that brand?

00:31:20,453 --> 00:31:22,288
Tillworth?

00:31:22,288 --> 00:31:23,556
Not sure.

00:31:26,292 --> 00:31:27,494
JEREMY:
<i>It's--it's...</i>

00:31:27,494 --> 00:31:28,728
It's just a few bucks.

00:31:28,728 --> 00:31:31,197
I--I wanted to buy
a pack of cigs.

00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:34,801
Unless I can...
I can bum one from you?

00:31:38,638 --> 00:31:40,073
Why don't you come inside
with me?

00:31:45,745 --> 00:31:47,347
Mitch, can you
maintain a visual?

00:31:47,347 --> 00:31:49,049
(over radio): Negative.
We're blocked.

00:31:49,049 --> 00:31:50,784
Adjusting position.

00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,619
CALEB: Man to man, Jeremy,
you on something?

00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,087
JEREMY:
What do you mean?

00:31:54,087 --> 00:31:55,388
CALEB:
The way you're acting.

00:31:55,388 --> 00:31:57,023
The way you parked
your car last night,

00:31:57,023 --> 00:31:59,025
blocking the door.
Nearly burned me to death.

00:31:59,025 --> 00:32:01,061
Makes me think
your mind's not straight.

00:32:01,061 --> 00:32:03,663
Shrooms? Pills?

00:32:03,663 --> 00:32:05,665
I don't know...acid?

00:32:05,665 --> 00:32:07,100
Acid?

00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,635
(click, hissing)

00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:10,537
(screaming over radio)
Go, Mitch! Go!

00:32:15,708 --> 00:32:18,545
(screaming)

00:32:18,545 --> 00:32:20,080
On the floor! Now!

00:32:24,584 --> 00:32:26,119
(grunts)

00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:27,420
Stop!

00:32:29,055 --> 00:32:31,458
(grunts)

00:32:31,458 --> 00:32:33,660
(gun cocks)

00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:36,496
(grunts, coughs)

00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:38,398
OFFICER:
Get him up.

00:32:38,398 --> 00:32:40,633
Let's go.
Go!

00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,410
(distant dog barking,
siren approaching)

00:32:52,612 --> 00:32:57,150
I think you might've stumbled
on an odd premonition,

00:32:57,150 --> 00:33:00,787
hating Timo for his skin,
because his skin,

00:33:00,787 --> 00:33:02,655
or at least
little chunks of it,

00:33:02,655 --> 00:33:04,524
caught in your chain here,

00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:06,593
are gonna put you
away for murder.

00:33:06,593 --> 00:33:08,528
BRASS: And add the
Hate Crime component,

00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:10,196
and your peculiar

00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:13,666
method of clean-up--
that's death row, easy.

00:33:15,635 --> 00:33:18,138
Mutual...

00:33:18,138 --> 00:33:21,107
combat.

00:33:21,107 --> 00:33:23,409
That wetback's first mistake
was walking in the place.

00:33:23,409 --> 00:33:26,212
<i>Second mistake</i>
<i>was opening his mouth.</i>

00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:27,480
You got a problem with me?

00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:30,083
Bunch of redneck bitches!

00:33:30,083 --> 00:33:31,284
(grunting)

00:33:46,499 --> 00:33:48,501
(grunts, gasps)

00:33:50,303 --> 00:33:53,239
Didn't mean
for it to end that way.

00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:55,508
Told Jeremy
to bring the car around

00:33:55,508 --> 00:33:57,410
so I could drag the kid out,

00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,145
drive him to the hospital.

00:33:59,145 --> 00:34:00,413
He was dead,
and you knew it,

00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:02,115
so you dragged him
into the club,

00:34:02,115 --> 00:34:04,150
you dumped him on the floor,
and then you torched

00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:06,352
the whole scene.
I didn't set that fire.

00:34:06,352 --> 00:34:08,288
Oh, so, what was it?

00:34:08,288 --> 00:34:11,624
A thousand-degree
coincidence?

00:34:11,624 --> 00:34:13,560
Huh?

00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,328
Pack enough rage in a room,

00:34:15,328 --> 00:34:16,763
sometimes you get lucky.

00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:19,432
I didn't start your fire,

00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:22,368
but I know who did.

00:34:22,368 --> 00:34:23,736
And seeing as though
he incinerated

00:34:23,736 --> 00:34:26,206
three good, proud white people,

00:34:26,206 --> 00:34:27,707
why don't I tell you
what he looked like?

00:34:30,376 --> 00:34:32,212
Are you believing any of this?

00:34:32,212 --> 00:34:33,513
No.

00:34:35,548 --> 00:34:37,517
Okay, Chuckles, go for it.

00:34:39,252 --> 00:34:40,553
About to bang heads
with the kid,

00:34:40,553 --> 00:34:42,355
I saw him crouched in a corner.

00:34:42,355 --> 00:34:46,492
(indistinct shouting)

00:34:46,492 --> 00:34:49,596
<i>Came out a minute later,</i>
<i>and I saw what he was up to.</i>

00:34:49,596 --> 00:34:53,333
RUSSELL:
<i>Would you recognize him again?</i>

00:34:53,333 --> 00:34:54,534
Him?

00:34:54,534 --> 00:34:56,469
None of those.

00:34:59,672 --> 00:35:01,307
He had on a black T-shirt.

00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:03,443
Some kind of logo.

00:35:03,443 --> 00:35:05,044
Death's head, maybe.

00:35:08,581 --> 00:35:11,084
Shirt like this?

00:35:11,084 --> 00:35:12,518
Yeah.

00:35:14,287 --> 00:35:16,789
Who was wearing that?

00:35:16,789 --> 00:35:18,458
John Doe number three.

00:35:18,458 --> 00:35:21,294
He's on life support
at Desert Palm Hospital.

00:35:22,762 --> 00:35:24,230
Okay.

00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:26,099
(monitor beeping)

00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,525
(device beeps)

00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,432
(device beeps)

00:36:05,672 --> 00:36:06,806
(device beeps)

00:36:10,677 --> 00:36:13,346
(computer blipping)
<i>Suspect's name is</i>

00:36:13,346 --> 00:36:17,216
Ian Baxton, and he's blazed
a pretty long sheet.

00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:18,518
Multiple priors for arson.

00:36:18,518 --> 00:36:21,688
Still on probation
for a torched warehouse.

00:36:21,688 --> 00:36:23,222
STOKES:
Pull up his case history.

00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:24,357
Okay.

00:36:26,025 --> 00:36:27,260
He's got a signature M.O.

00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,494
Tillworth cigarette,

00:36:28,494 --> 00:36:30,596
rubber-banded
with matches.

00:36:30,596 --> 00:36:33,499
Just like what you found
at the club--that makes it easy.

00:36:33,499 --> 00:36:35,635
It should've been a lot easier.

00:36:37,437 --> 00:36:38,638
Now, fellas, you wield
this thing right,

00:36:38,638 --> 00:36:40,406
you get in anywhere.

00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:42,508
Or out, should Donnelly's mom
trap you in her bedroom.

00:36:42,508 --> 00:36:44,043
(chuckles)

00:36:44,043 --> 00:36:45,745
Square up and let 'er rip.

00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:48,114
Miller. I think
we need to talk

00:36:48,114 --> 00:36:50,483
for a second.
Kind of in the middle
of something here, chief.

00:36:50,483 --> 00:36:52,652
Oh, really? Hey, boys,
what's he teaching you,

00:36:52,652 --> 00:36:55,254
how to jeopardize
a quadruple homicide case?

00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:56,756
Take a break, fellas.

00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:58,524
What the hell
you talking about?

00:36:58,524 --> 00:37:00,093
FINLAY: Well,
we just found out

00:37:00,093 --> 00:37:02,562
that you worked
Ian Baxton's arsons.

00:37:02,562 --> 00:37:04,497
Yeah.
So you knew his signature.

00:37:04,497 --> 00:37:06,599
And when we found
that signature at the club,

00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,167
you didn't say anything.

00:37:08,167 --> 00:37:09,635
'Cause I followed up
on that lead, solo.

00:37:09,635 --> 00:37:11,471
I checked with his P.O.

00:37:11,471 --> 00:37:13,439
Baxton was working
the night shift.
Or maybe that's what

00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:15,274
he told his P.O.
before he ditched out of work.

00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:17,276
He's not our guy.

00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:19,312
Yeah? Do you know
where he is right now?

00:37:19,312 --> 00:37:22,248
Home. Look, I'll get
confirmation if you
want, all right?

00:37:22,248 --> 00:37:24,250
But I've studied this guy.
Occupied buildings

00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:27,086
are not his style, okay?

00:37:27,086 --> 00:37:29,355
He's in
the burn ward.

00:37:29,355 --> 00:37:30,790
Well, he got
caught up in a fire

00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,525
that he started, but...

00:37:32,525 --> 00:37:33,793
come on,
if you'd have mentioned

00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:35,294
that you knew
the signature,

00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:36,629
we'd have solved it yesterday.

00:37:40,366 --> 00:37:42,135
Nothing to say?

00:37:42,135 --> 00:37:43,436
Yeah, it's my bad.

00:37:43,436 --> 00:37:44,771
Your bad?

00:37:49,742 --> 00:37:52,245
Hey, guys, there's something
else you should know.

00:37:52,245 --> 00:37:54,046
Baxton only burns for hire.

00:37:56,182 --> 00:37:58,184
7,500 bucks...

00:37:58,184 --> 00:38:01,254
in a paper bag,
under the arsonist's mattress.

00:38:01,254 --> 00:38:03,222
That's the exact
amount that you got

00:38:03,222 --> 00:38:05,291
when you pawned
your prized guitar.

00:38:05,291 --> 00:38:06,759
You showed us
the receipt.

00:38:06,759 --> 00:38:08,461
You pawn your guitar,
and you...

00:38:08,461 --> 00:38:10,163
pay the arsonist,

00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:11,497
you collect the insurance.

00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:13,699
I think I may have
mentioned this before,

00:38:13,699 --> 00:38:16,569
but I pawned the guitar
to save my club.

00:38:16,569 --> 00:38:18,171
You're wasting
your time.

00:38:18,171 --> 00:38:21,340
Your fingerprints are
all over the bag, Stu.

00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,443
We got you. It's over.

00:38:23,443 --> 00:38:25,411
So can we talk?

00:38:25,411 --> 00:38:27,280
I'd really like to know
why you did this.

00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,449
You want out of the club,
you need the cash,

00:38:29,449 --> 00:38:31,651
why didn't you just
sell the dump?

00:38:31,651 --> 00:38:33,786
Dump? Come on.

00:38:33,786 --> 00:38:35,788
You sound like those
real estate crooks.

00:38:35,788 --> 00:38:38,791
Uh...
"Hey, Stu...

00:38:38,791 --> 00:38:41,394
you know, it's a tear-down;
you can't even give it away."

00:38:41,394 --> 00:38:43,629
I spent 30 years
of my life

00:38:43,629 --> 00:38:45,364
busting my hump for that place.

00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:47,500
And you know what?

00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,635
For a long time,
I did pretty good.

00:38:49,635 --> 00:38:52,738
So why'd you want out so bad
that you torched the place?

00:38:52,738 --> 00:38:55,174
I mean, see, that...
I don't understand that.

00:38:56,476 --> 00:38:59,479
Can't tell me
you don't see it.

00:38:59,479 --> 00:39:03,449
You've been around--a guy
in your line of work? What?

00:39:03,449 --> 00:39:05,785
What is it I don't see?

00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:11,324
The world's getting nastier.

00:39:11,324 --> 00:39:13,559
It's getting hard to stomach,
don't you think?

00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:15,695
Day after day.

00:39:15,695 --> 00:39:18,030
You see the way
these kids act, huh?

00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:19,632
They're animals.

00:39:19,632 --> 00:39:23,703
They get up on the stage,
and the stuff that they spout.

00:39:23,703 --> 00:39:26,205
They spit right in my face
if I get in their way.

00:39:26,205 --> 00:39:28,741
They're kids, Stu.

00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:30,309
Young, stupid kids!

00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:36,516
You set a fire
in a club full of kids

00:39:36,516 --> 00:39:39,752
because it's less suspicious
than torching it empty?

00:39:41,487 --> 00:39:44,190
<i>They're</i> animals?
Give me a break.

00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:45,525
What's that make you?

00:39:45,525 --> 00:39:47,560
(sighs heavily)

00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:52,198
I didn't think the fire
would spread that fast.

00:39:52,198 --> 00:39:54,367
I thought they'd have
time to get out of there.

00:39:54,367 --> 00:39:57,336
Well, your timing was off.

00:39:57,336 --> 00:39:58,704
By three.

00:40:14,554 --> 00:40:17,723
It's called the death spiral.

00:40:17,723 --> 00:40:20,192
It's created by the pheromones
the ants put out

00:40:20,192 --> 00:40:22,128
to warn the colony of danger.

00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:24,363
Each ant just follows
the one in front of it.

00:40:24,363 --> 00:40:27,233
Blindly circling
in an endless loop.

00:40:27,233 --> 00:40:29,435
Mindless conformity.

00:40:29,435 --> 00:40:31,370
Has its advantages.

00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:34,674
Like what?

00:40:34,674 --> 00:40:36,809
Well, you don't see
any of them

00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:39,378
wrapping chains around
each other's throats,

00:40:39,378 --> 00:40:41,747
or burning each other up
for money.

00:40:41,747 --> 00:40:44,684
That's true.

00:40:44,684 --> 00:40:46,385
But, then, I bet...

00:40:46,385 --> 00:40:48,588
you won't see any of them
stepping out of line

00:40:48,588 --> 00:40:50,456
to write a symphony or...

00:40:50,456 --> 00:40:52,725
pursue enlightenment, either.

00:40:52,725 --> 00:40:56,195
Yeah, it's a bit
of a trade-off, I guess.

00:40:56,195 --> 00:40:57,763
How long do they
go on like that?

00:40:57,763 --> 00:41:00,099
Well, till they
drop dead from exhaustion.

00:41:00,099 --> 00:41:03,269
Or until some kind soul...

00:41:03,269 --> 00:41:05,438
disrupts the spiral.

00:41:05,438 --> 00:41:07,473
Man, I ain't stickin'
my hand in there.

00:41:07,473 --> 00:41:09,609
You do it.
You be a benevolent god.

00:41:09,609 --> 00:41:11,477
All right.

00:41:12,545 --> 00:41:15,281
Okay, little guys...

00:41:15,281 --> 00:41:17,149
be free.

00:41:19,251 --> 00:41:21,320
Look at that. Wow.

00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:24,190
Well...

00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,424
Hey, lookie there.

00:41:25,424 --> 00:41:27,526
I think that's Beethoven.
