Chefs, what would you say
is the most indispensable tool

00:00:53,657 --> 00:00:54,958
in your kitchen?

00:00:54,958 --> 00:00:56,426
That's easy, my knife.

00:00:56,426 --> 00:00:58,528
Something even more essential.

00:00:58,528 --> 00:00:59,563
My palate.

00:00:59,563 --> 00:01:00,597
Very good, Michelle.

00:01:00,597 --> 00:01:02,766
Today's advantage round

00:01:02,766 --> 00:01:04,568
is a palate test.

00:01:04,568 --> 00:01:06,303
Each one of you

00:01:06,303 --> 00:01:07,804
gonna sample
one of these four dishes

00:01:07,804 --> 00:01:10,774
and identify
the mystery protein.

00:01:10,774 --> 00:01:12,409
First chef to do so

00:01:12,409 --> 00:01:14,778
will win immunity
for the next round.

00:01:14,778 --> 00:01:17,214
Chefs.

00:01:21,551 --> 00:01:22,486
Give it a try.

00:01:29,726 --> 00:01:32,496
Looks like
some herb-crusted meat.

00:01:36,199 --> 00:01:37,734
It's not beef or pork.

00:01:37,734 --> 00:01:38,969
It's too chewy.

00:01:38,969 --> 00:01:41,338
Strong iron flavor.

00:01:41,338 --> 00:01:42,706
Is this made
from liver? Maybe lamb?

00:01:42,706 --> 00:01:43,807
That's incorrect.

00:01:43,807 --> 00:01:45,809
Lots of Asian spices.

00:01:45,809 --> 00:01:48,578
Reminds me of a fish eye soup

00:01:48,578 --> 00:01:50,380
I had in Vietnam.

00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,715
Definitely not a fish eye.

00:01:53,316 --> 00:01:55,252
Could be... pig?

00:02:05,629 --> 00:02:07,330
Oh, my God,
is that a contact lens?

00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:08,632
It's human!

00:02:11,435 --> 00:02:13,470
(camera clicking)

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,305
(indistinct radio chatter)

00:02:15,305 --> 00:02:16,606
It looks human.

00:02:16,606 --> 00:02:18,608
But, uh, I can't
say for sure.

00:02:18,608 --> 00:02:20,510
You know, they're down
to the final four.

00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:22,579
They must shoot this show,
like, six weeks ahead,

00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:23,914
because I watched last night,

00:02:23,914 --> 00:02:25,449
and there were still
ten contestants.

00:02:25,449 --> 00:02:27,417
Can you believe Michelle
is still in the running?

00:02:27,417 --> 00:02:28,718
After she served
that undercooked

00:02:28,718 --> 00:02:30,921
chicken roulade
to the judges last week?

00:02:30,921 --> 00:02:33,490
Didn't realize you guys were
such big fans of the show.

00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:35,926
Good-looking people
making great-looking food?

00:02:35,926 --> 00:02:37,761
We love this show.

00:02:37,761 --> 00:02:39,296
RUSSELL: Well, you're gonna
have to find some other show

00:02:39,296 --> 00:02:40,497
to watch until
we figure out

00:02:40,497 --> 00:02:42,265
this mystery ingredient.

00:02:42,265 --> 00:02:44,835
FINLAY:
It's not caviar.

00:02:44,835 --> 00:02:46,837
Definitely human blood.

00:02:46,837 --> 00:02:48,338
Oh, brother.
I got it right!

00:02:48,338 --> 00:02:50,474
I guessed "human"!
You all heard me say it.

00:02:50,474 --> 00:02:52,509
I win immunity.
Oh, come on. That's crap!

00:02:52,509 --> 00:02:53,510
MICHELLE: We were
all thinking it.

00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:54,678
You just said it first.

00:02:54,678 --> 00:02:56,279
Nobody wins this round.

00:02:56,279 --> 00:02:58,748
The mystery protein
was supposed to be kangaroo.

00:02:58,748 --> 00:03:00,684
It doesn't matter.
I got it right. I win.

00:03:00,684 --> 00:03:01,685

Ray?

00:03:01,685 --> 00:03:02,919
Is that your name? Ray?

00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:04,387
Yeah.

00:03:04,387 --> 00:03:06,389
What made you think
it was human?

00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:08,892
Last time I checked,
animals don't wear contacts.

00:03:08,892 --> 00:03:10,527
(chuckles)
But didn't you think

00:03:10,527 --> 00:03:12,796
it was a little bit odd
that a show would

00:03:12,796 --> 00:03:14,898
cook and serve up
a human being?

00:03:14,898 --> 00:03:17,200
Mm-mm. That wouldn't be
the weirdest thing to happen

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,335
on a reality show.

Maybe they swapped the meat

00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,545
to give themselves an edge up.

00:03:28,545 --> 00:03:29,813
What do you think, Ray?

00:03:29,813 --> 00:03:32,682
They don't exactly sell
human body parts

00:03:32,682 --> 00:03:34,484
at the grocery store.

00:03:34,484 --> 00:03:36,419
No, no. There's only two
ways you get a body:

00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:37,687
you steal it

00:03:37,687 --> 00:03:39,756

the DNA becomes denatured.

00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:27,304
Yeah. There's no way an
entire body was used to make

00:04:27,304 --> 00:04:29,806
these four dishes.

00:04:29,806 --> 00:04:32,442
So what happened to the
remains of the remains?

00:04:32,442 --> 00:04:34,177
That's what I'd
like to know.

00:04:35,378 --> 00:04:36,513
Right here, sir.

00:04:36,513 --> 00:04:38,582
Oh, there you go.
Uh, ma'am?

00:04:38,582 --> 00:04:41,785
Sorry. Could we, uh,
talk to you for a second?

00:04:43,453 --> 00:04:45,822
Hi. Executive producer,
Nadine Bradley.

00:04:45,822 --> 00:04:47,557
Uh, how long is
this going to take?

00:04:47,557 --> 00:04:49,559
Because we were right
in the middle of filming.

00:04:49,559 --> 00:04:50,560
Ms. Bradley,

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,195
you-you called us when you found

00:04:52,195 --> 00:04:53,964
human body parts in your food.

00:04:53,964 --> 00:04:55,966
We're gonna need to find out
how that happened.

00:04:55,966 --> 00:04:59,235
Yeah, well, we're the highest
rated culinary competition show

00:04:59,235 --> 00:05:01,271
on air, so any of our rivals

00:05:01,271 --> 00:05:03,740
could've pulled a stunt like
this to try and sabotage us.

00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,475
Or an eliminated contestant.

00:05:05,475 --> 00:05:07,477
The prize money is just
the beginning.

00:05:07,477 --> 00:05:10,580
Your past winners have gone on
to open their own restaurants,

00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:11,848
become celebrity chefs.

00:05:11,848 --> 00:05:13,617
A win is worth millions.

00:05:13,617 --> 00:05:15,752
I doubt any of them
are involved.

00:05:15,752 --> 00:05:17,621
The eliminated contestants
are sequestered

00:05:17,621 --> 00:05:19,623
at a nearby hotel--
we don't want viewers

00:05:19,623 --> 00:05:21,558
knowing who's
been kicked off.

00:05:21,558 --> 00:05:23,426
We're gonna also need to see
your footage from

00:05:23,426 --> 00:05:24,628
the last 48 hours.

00:05:24,628 --> 00:05:27,197
We have 13 cameras
on this stage,

00:05:27,197 --> 00:05:29,733
seven in the house set where
the remaining contestants live.

00:05:29,733 --> 00:05:31,501
Are they on all the time?
No.

00:05:31,501 --> 00:05:33,536
The cameras on the house set
shut down about 10:00.

00:05:33,536 --> 00:05:36,339
That's still over
500 hours of footage.

00:05:36,339 --> 00:05:38,575
So, this was a palate test.

00:05:38,575 --> 00:05:42,278
The contestants did not
cook the food. Who did?

00:05:42,278 --> 00:05:43,613
We have a team
of prep chefs who use

00:05:43,613 --> 00:05:45,515
the kitchen set
after-hours.

00:05:45,515 --> 00:05:46,916
Clocked out about
9:00 last night.

00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:48,485
Went and did an event
at the Palermo,

00:05:48,485 --> 00:05:50,253
then came back
at 6:00 this morning.

00:05:50,253 --> 00:05:52,188
We're still gonna need
to talk to 'em though.

00:05:52,188 --> 00:05:53,723
Who had access
to the kitchen last night?

00:05:53,723 --> 00:05:55,959
The contestants
and the entire crew.
(phone ringing)

00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:57,961
That's legal.
Sorry.

00:05:57,961 --> 00:05:58,962
I have to take this.

00:06:00,397 --> 00:06:02,298
Cast and crew?

00:06:02,298 --> 00:06:04,768
That is over 100 suspects.

00:06:04,768 --> 00:06:06,670
Well...

00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,672
body was cooked in the kitchen.

00:06:08,672 --> 00:06:10,674
Can't believe I just said that.

00:06:10,674 --> 00:06:12,442
Start in the kitchen.

00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:15,945
♪ ♪

00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:40,570
I just found human blood
down that drain.

00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:43,306
Hmm. Could be the body
was dismembered here.

00:06:43,306 --> 00:06:44,774
Can you hand me
that luminol, please?

00:06:44,774 --> 00:06:46,309
Sure.

00:06:46,309 --> 00:06:47,777
I'll get the lights.

00:06:47,777 --> 00:06:49,879
Thanks.

00:06:59,255 --> 00:07:00,790
That's a large volume of blood.

00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:02,459
Lights, please.

00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:04,527
Means we're not looking
at a stolen body.

00:07:04,527 --> 00:07:06,329
We're looking at murder.

00:07:06,329 --> 00:07:09,599
Well, the prep chefs left
at 9:00, so the murder must have

00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,969
happened after that.

00:07:12,969 --> 00:07:15,171
You know, these gel mats
can hold an impression

00:07:15,171 --> 00:07:16,406
for up to 12 hours.

00:07:16,406 --> 00:07:18,742
Very close to
the blood pool.

00:07:18,742 --> 00:07:21,377
Maybe we can I.D. the
last person who stepped on it.

00:07:26,649 --> 00:07:28,485
Might be our killer.

00:07:30,553 --> 00:07:33,857
You've heard how Jesus
turned water into wine.

00:07:33,857 --> 00:07:37,494
Now watch in amazement
as I turn blood

00:07:37,494 --> 00:07:38,862
into caviar.

00:07:38,862 --> 00:07:41,464
You're comparing yourself
to Jesus?

00:07:41,464 --> 00:07:42,599
Wow.

00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:44,400
First, I take the blood

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,803
and add it to a mixture of...

00:07:46,803 --> 00:07:50,607
calcium glucocinate
and calcium lactate.

00:07:50,607 --> 00:07:52,375
Next, I add xanthan,

00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:55,211
a polysaccharide secreted
from the bacterium

00:07:55,211 --> 00:07:56,746
<i>Xanthomonas campestris.</i>

00:07:56,746 --> 00:07:59,816
Used as a thickening agent
in food and a stabilizing agent

00:07:59,816 --> 00:08:01,551
in makeup.

00:08:01,551 --> 00:08:03,853
I took chemistry, too.

00:08:03,853 --> 00:08:06,756
HODGES: Blend until
thoroughly dissolved.

00:08:06,756 --> 00:08:08,625
(chuckles)

00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:10,760
I take my handy pipette,

00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,896
extract some of
the blood mixture

00:08:12,896 --> 00:08:15,298
and drop it into the alginate
one drop at a time.

00:08:19,736 --> 00:08:23,306
I will pull the sphere
from the alginate,

00:08:23,306 --> 00:08:25,642
plunge it into an ice-cold
water bath

00:08:25,642 --> 00:08:28,945
and...

00:08:28,945 --> 00:08:30,914
<i>buon appetito.</i>

00:08:30,914 --> 00:08:33,416

I'll pass, thanks.

00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:36,386
As you can see, molecular
gastronomy requires great skill

00:08:36,386 --> 00:08:38,655
and an aptitude for chemistry.

00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:41,291

00:08:53,736 --> 00:08:55,438
on the Strip.

00:08:55,438 --> 00:08:56,906
He was the guest judge.

00:08:56,906 --> 00:08:58,908
Taped an episode
of <i>Elite Chef</i> yesterday.

00:08:58,908 --> 00:09:01,477
And then this morning,
did not show up for work.

00:09:01,477 --> 00:09:03,413
You think he's the one
in the soup?

00:09:03,413 --> 00:09:05,315
Well, he did have
a very big confrontation

00:09:05,315 --> 00:09:07,684
with the contestant
who was just eliminated.

00:09:07,684 --> 00:09:10,320
I wouldn't feed it to my dog.
And I hate my dog.

00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,688
WOLFGANG:
This looks like

00:09:11,688 --> 00:09:13,456
a big mess on a plate.

00:09:13,456 --> 00:09:16,259
No sense of presentation.
The presentation
was flawed,

00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:18,695
but I think that it was seasoned
very well.
But you seem to fail

00:09:18,695 --> 00:09:20,830
to appreciate there are
other spices than pepper.

00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,966
I would call you "Chef,"
but that would

00:09:22,966 --> 00:09:25,335
demean the entire profession.
(scoffs)

00:09:25,335 --> 00:09:26,436
That guy's just mean.

00:09:26,436 --> 00:09:28,271
I think he's being honest.

00:09:28,271 --> 00:09:30,540
WOLFGANG: Derek, I'm sorry,
but you are not

00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,941
the Elite Chef.

00:09:31,941 --> 00:09:33,910
I believe you have
some passion for food,

00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:37,413
and maybe someday you'll have
your own restaurant.

00:09:37,413 --> 00:09:38,848
Where he will probably
kill someone

00:09:38,848 --> 00:09:41,284
with salmonella poisoning.

00:09:41,284 --> 00:09:42,919
Your cooking is horrific,
Mr. Barlow.

00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:45,255
Do restaurant patrons
a favor everywhere

00:09:45,255 --> 00:09:46,689
and get out
of the food industry.

00:09:46,689 --> 00:09:47,690
(bleep)
(grunting)

00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:48,691
Call security!

00:09:48,691 --> 00:09:49,726
Get him off me!

00:09:49,726 --> 00:09:51,527
(bleeping)
(shouting)

00:09:51,527 --> 00:09:53,796
You know what? You better
watch your back, Deveraux.

00:09:53,796 --> 00:09:55,765
Watch your back.
RUSSELL:
Okay.

00:09:55,765 --> 00:09:57,200
That was a threat.

00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,902
Derek was such
a nice guy on the show,

00:09:58,902 --> 00:10:00,270
but I guess even

00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:02,605
nice guys have
their breaking point.

00:10:02,605 --> 00:10:04,340
(beeping)
Back a bit more.

00:10:05,441 --> 00:10:08,311
Keep it coming.

00:10:08,311 --> 00:10:10,580
That's great. Perfect. Thanks.
Lucky you managed

00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:13,216
to stop the garbage truck
before it made it to the dump.

00:10:13,216 --> 00:10:15,718
All the trash collected from
<i>Elite Chef</i> this morning

00:10:15,718 --> 00:10:17,320
is still inside.

00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,789
(whirring)

00:10:19,789 --> 00:10:22,558
You talk to the driver?
Yeah, didn't notice
anything suspicious.

00:10:22,558 --> 00:10:24,427
With all
that rotting food inside,

00:10:24,427 --> 00:10:26,529
hard to tell if there's a body.

00:10:29,832 --> 00:10:31,901
This could take a while.
Well, we only

00:10:31,901 --> 00:10:33,670
have to go through
the green bags,

00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,538
'cause those are the ones
that the studio uses.

00:10:46,883 --> 00:10:48,718
(gags)

00:10:48,718 --> 00:10:49,819
Maggots.

00:10:49,819 --> 00:10:51,621
I don't even
notice anymore.

00:10:51,621 --> 00:10:53,556
(groans)

00:10:58,928 --> 00:11:00,396
Got an arm.

00:11:02,198 --> 00:11:03,933
Definitely male.

00:11:03,933 --> 00:11:05,969
Mr. Deveraux, I presume.
Hard to say.

00:11:05,969 --> 00:11:07,971
Henry wasn't able
to extract a DNA profile

00:11:07,971 --> 00:11:10,206
from the blood found
in the kitchen.

00:11:10,206 --> 00:11:12,208
Looks like some of the flesh
has been excised.

00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:15,378
Probably used to make
that herb-crusted meat.

00:11:15,378 --> 00:11:17,246
(groans)

00:11:17,246 --> 00:11:19,315
Let's see if we can
find the rest of him.

00:11:20,917 --> 00:11:23,786
FINLAY: Those look like
fried mac and cheese balls.

00:11:25,688 --> 00:11:27,724
PHILLIPS:
Definitely not mac and cheese.

00:11:27,724 --> 00:11:29,425
I think it's something else.

00:11:29,425 --> 00:11:31,361
Rocky Mountain Oysters.

00:11:31,361 --> 00:11:33,696
Aren't those fried
bull testicles?

00:11:33,696 --> 00:11:35,565
Indeed, they are,
and quite delicious.

00:11:35,565 --> 00:11:37,800
It's like a light
chicken nugget.

00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,736
But they're about three
times bigger than this.

00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:43,539
This is an orchidometer.

00:11:43,539 --> 00:11:45,375
It measures testicle size.

00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,510
And these are consistent

00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:49,379
with that of an adult human.

00:11:49,379 --> 00:11:51,414
Guess the killer didn't want
to waste anything.

00:11:51,414 --> 00:11:53,182
Ugh. Gross.

00:11:53,182 --> 00:11:55,685
Hey, did you ever hear
about that Japanese chef?

00:11:55,685 --> 00:11:57,954
He removed his own genitals,

00:11:57,954 --> 00:12:00,289
and then served them
at a dinner party

00:12:00,289 --> 00:12:02,825
for $250 plate.

00:12:02,825 --> 00:12:04,260
Lowballed.

00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,728
(laughs)

00:12:05,728 --> 00:12:07,363
Look at that.

00:12:07,363 --> 00:12:09,332
Dark pigmentation
on the chicharone.

00:12:09,332 --> 00:12:11,200
Maybe I can reconstitute it.

00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,935
♪ ♪

00:12:29,452 --> 00:12:31,821
(beeping)

00:12:31,821 --> 00:12:33,289
That's a tattoo.

00:12:33,289 --> 00:12:34,757
Where have I
seen that before?

00:12:37,326 --> 00:12:39,629
I would call you chef,

00:12:39,629 --> 00:12:41,964
but that would demean
the entire profession.

00:12:41,964 --> 00:12:43,766
PHILLIPS:
That's the tattoo,

00:12:43,766 --> 00:12:45,201
but that's not Graham Deveraux.

00:12:45,201 --> 00:12:46,536
No, that's Derek Barlow.

00:12:46,536 --> 00:12:47,970
Who was just eliminated
from the show?

00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:50,173
And now eliminated for good.

00:12:54,777 --> 00:12:56,446
So, Derek Barlow
is not our killer.

00:12:56,446 --> 00:12:58,681
He's our victim.
DNA just confirmed it.

00:12:58,681 --> 00:13:00,349
Okay, where's Deveraux?

00:13:00,349 --> 00:13:01,784
Still unaccounted for.

00:13:01,784 --> 00:13:03,653
Oh. A lot of
killers miss work

00:13:03,653 --> 00:13:05,488
the day after
they commit murder.

00:13:05,488 --> 00:13:08,658
Anyway, we know that
Deveraux had an altercation

00:13:08,658 --> 00:13:10,259
with Barlow yesterday.

00:13:10,259 --> 00:13:11,928
Maybe we have
the right players,

00:13:11,928 --> 00:13:14,697
just in the wrong roles.

00:13:14,697 --> 00:13:16,866
You ask me,
they're both scumbags.

00:13:16,866 --> 00:13:18,734
Especially Derek.

00:13:18,734 --> 00:13:20,803
I know, as a producer,
I'm supposed to be impartial,

00:13:20,803 --> 00:13:22,438
but that guy was a piece
of work.

00:13:22,438 --> 00:13:24,740
He did not appear
that way on the show.

00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,242
He was a great chef,

00:13:26,242 --> 00:13:28,511
and I wanted the audience
to root for him,

00:13:28,511 --> 00:13:30,880
so I cut out a lot of the stuff
where he was being an ass.

00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,349
I can show you
the raw footage.

00:13:33,349 --> 00:13:34,917
Sure.

00:13:38,921 --> 00:13:41,791
(sizzling)

00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:42,925
(plate crashes)

00:13:42,925 --> 00:13:44,494
What the hell?!

00:13:44,494 --> 00:13:46,796
Why don't you pick up
your mess, sweetheart?

00:13:46,796 --> 00:13:47,930
You're such an ass!

00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:49,499
(laughs)
(sighs)

00:13:49,499 --> 00:13:50,633
DEREK:
Mmm!

00:13:50,633 --> 00:13:51,901
That is exactly how

00:13:51,901 --> 00:13:54,270
I like seeing my ladies
in the kitchen--

00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:55,638
on their hands and knees.

00:13:55,638 --> 00:13:57,206
Ugh.

00:13:57,206 --> 00:13:58,574
That's just the tip
of the iceberg.

00:13:58,574 --> 00:14:00,576
He tried to sabotage
all the contestants.

00:14:00,576 --> 00:14:02,345
Now this seems personal.

00:14:02,345 --> 00:14:05,815
I mean, who would have hated him
enough to want to cook him?

00:14:05,815 --> 00:14:09,252
To be honest, I wouldn't
put it past any of them.

00:14:09,252 --> 00:14:10,753
Derek tried to sabotage me.

00:14:10,753 --> 00:14:11,888
Well, screw him.

00:14:11,888 --> 00:14:13,523
(laughing)

00:14:13,523 --> 00:14:15,925
I always thought
his cooking was overrated.

00:14:15,925 --> 00:14:18,494
He's gone,
and I'm in the final four.

00:14:18,494 --> 00:14:19,795
With Derek out of the way,

00:14:19,795 --> 00:14:21,898
I really think
I can win this thing.

00:14:21,898 --> 00:14:24,834
BRODY:
Greg and I were able to recover
<i>most</i> of Derek Barlow.

00:14:24,834 --> 00:14:27,937
ROBBINS:
At least the parts that didn't
make it to the dinner table.

00:14:27,937 --> 00:14:29,505
You know, I read somewhere

00:14:29,505 --> 00:14:31,507
that the Yanomamo
tribe in the Amazon

00:14:31,507 --> 00:14:33,342
consume pieces
of their deceased loved ones

00:14:33,342 --> 00:14:34,677
as an act of mourning.

00:14:34,677 --> 00:14:37,213
A way of keeping them alive
within them.

00:14:37,213 --> 00:14:39,916
Well, I don't think that was
the case with Mr. Barlow here.

00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:41,817
Finlay said everyone hated him.

00:14:41,817 --> 00:14:43,953
Yes, but at least
the killer was kind enough

00:14:43,953 --> 00:14:46,789
to kill Mr. Barlow before
they dismembered and cooked him.

00:14:46,789 --> 00:14:50,259
Look at the margins near
the disarticulations.

00:14:50,259 --> 00:14:51,827
Skin is blanched.

00:14:51,827 --> 00:14:53,296
Orange in color.

00:14:53,296 --> 00:14:55,698
Blood wasn't circulating.

00:14:55,698 --> 00:14:57,700
May I?

00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,569
Go ahead.

00:14:59,569 --> 00:15:01,437
Looks like he's
had a head injury.

00:15:01,437 --> 00:15:04,540
Found that examining
underneath his hairline.

00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:07,410
Based on the bruising,
at least 48 hours old.

00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:08,811
It's unrelated to his death.

00:15:08,811 --> 00:15:10,646
So, what's C.O.D.?

00:15:10,646 --> 00:15:12,815
Exsanguination due to multiple
sharp force injuries.

00:15:12,815 --> 00:15:16,485
Based on the width
and depth of the wounds,

00:15:16,485 --> 00:15:19,188
I'd say the killer used
a single-edged knife

00:15:19,188 --> 00:15:22,291
with approximately
a seven-inch blade.

00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:25,595
Do you think the killer used
the same knife to dismember him?

00:15:25,595 --> 00:15:26,729
No, I don't believe so.

00:15:26,729 --> 00:15:28,397
Look at the radius
and ulna here--

00:15:28,397 --> 00:15:29,799
not a mark on them.

00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:31,567
The flesh was removed
with great skill

00:15:31,567 --> 00:15:33,869
and with the proper knife.

00:15:33,869 --> 00:15:35,671
A boning knife.

00:15:35,671 --> 00:15:38,374
Yeah, something any
professional chef would have.

00:15:38,374 --> 00:15:41,310
Now, the stabbing, however,
was less precise.

00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:43,679
I noted tool marks on the ribs.

00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:46,415
(heart beating)

00:15:46,415 --> 00:15:48,618
BRODY: Well, if we can
microsil the tool marks,

00:15:48,618 --> 00:15:51,187
we may be able to
indentify the knife

00:15:51,187 --> 00:15:52,555
and our killer.

00:15:52,555 --> 00:15:55,524
Rod Steward.

00:15:55,524 --> 00:15:58,327
I love his music, but what's
he got to do with this?

00:15:58,327 --> 00:15:59,462
No, that's Rod Stewart.

00:15:59,462 --> 00:16:00,963
This is Rod Steward,
with a "D."

00:16:00,963 --> 00:16:02,698
He's a designer of
high-end men's shoes.

00:16:02,698 --> 00:16:04,300
Very expensive.

00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,901
His size-ten loafer
matches an impression

00:16:05,901 --> 00:16:08,437
on the gel mat that Finn
found at the crime scene.

00:16:08,437 --> 00:16:10,606
Well, that's interesting,
'cause when I was on the set,

00:16:10,606 --> 00:16:13,509
I noticed most of the crew
wearing running shoes.

00:16:13,509 --> 00:16:15,311
So did a lot
of the contestants.

00:16:15,311 --> 00:16:17,413
Well, up-and-coming chefs
don't make a lot of money.

00:16:17,413 --> 00:16:19,215
But celebrity chefs do.

00:16:19,215 --> 00:16:22,318
Graham Deveraux,
our missing judge.

00:16:22,318 --> 00:16:23,919
Not missing anymore.

00:16:35,464 --> 00:16:36,732
(groans)

00:16:36,732 --> 00:16:39,935
You feeling better?

00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:42,338
Oh, just dandy.

00:16:42,338 --> 00:16:44,340
Lot of people have been
looking for you.

00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,341
What can I say?

00:16:45,341 --> 00:16:47,243
I'm a popular guy.

00:16:47,243 --> 00:16:49,512
You're also the lead suspect
in a homicide investigation.

00:16:49,512 --> 00:16:51,247
What are you
talking about?

00:16:51,247 --> 00:16:52,615
Derek Barlow,

00:16:52,615 --> 00:16:54,917
the contestant
who attacked you--

00:16:54,917 --> 00:16:56,919
he was murdered last night.

00:16:56,919 --> 00:16:59,388
Oh.

00:16:59,388 --> 00:17:02,892
Barlow is dead. Huh.

00:17:02,892 --> 00:17:04,293
He was stabbed to death

00:17:04,293 --> 00:17:05,461
in the <i>Elite Chef</i> kitchen.

00:17:06,929 --> 00:17:08,931
No.

00:17:08,931 --> 00:17:11,534
Well, that counts me out.

00:17:11,534 --> 00:17:13,602
Judges aren't allowed
in that kitchen.

00:17:13,602 --> 00:17:15,237
It's against the rules.

00:17:15,237 --> 00:17:17,506
If it's against the rules,
then how do you explain

00:17:17,506 --> 00:17:20,376
the fact that we found
an impression of your size ten

00:17:20,376 --> 00:17:23,346
Rod Steward loafer
in the kitchen of <i>Elite Chef</i>

00:17:23,346 --> 00:17:26,749
right next to where
Derek Barlow was murdered?

00:17:26,749 --> 00:17:28,584
(grunting)

00:17:30,853 --> 00:17:32,855
Because I was there,

00:17:32,855 --> 00:17:34,190
but not with Barlow.

00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:35,391
That hot female

00:17:35,391 --> 00:17:37,293
contestant--
what was her name?

00:17:37,293 --> 00:17:39,462
Uh, Cici? Yeah.

00:17:39,462 --> 00:17:42,465
She was showing me
her secret rub recipe.

00:17:42,465 --> 00:17:43,866
What time?
I don't know.

00:17:43,866 --> 00:17:46,469
Around 6:00, after we
finished filming.

00:17:46,469 --> 00:17:48,270
And after
your little hookup,

00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:50,539
you arranged for Derek
to meet you in the kitchen

00:17:50,539 --> 00:17:52,842
so you could teach him
a little lesson.

00:17:52,842 --> 00:17:56,445
Payback for attacking you
on the show.

00:17:56,445 --> 00:17:59,515
Derek Barlow
wasn't just murdered.

00:17:59,515 --> 00:18:04,286
<i>He was carved up, cooked, and</i>
<i>his blood turned into caviar.</i>

00:18:04,286 --> 00:18:06,722
Molecular gastronomy--
which also

00:18:06,722 --> 00:18:08,491
happens to be
your area of expertise.

00:18:08,491 --> 00:18:10,226
Look,

00:18:10,226 --> 00:18:12,695
any idiot can try their hand
at molecular gastronomy

00:18:12,695 --> 00:18:15,364
for the bargain price of $59.99.

00:18:15,364 --> 00:18:17,867
You just buy a kit online.

00:18:17,867 --> 00:18:19,769
Where were you
after 9:00 last night?

00:18:19,769 --> 00:18:21,771
Uh, I was in a limo downtown

00:18:21,771 --> 00:18:24,807
doing body shots of tequila
off two lovely young ladies.

00:18:24,807 --> 00:18:26,842
You can ask them if
you don't believe me.

00:18:26,842 --> 00:18:29,578
Their names were
Candy and Brown Sugar.

00:18:33,449 --> 00:18:35,317
So, you have something for me?

00:18:35,317 --> 00:18:38,354
I found kratom in Derek Barlow's
stomach contents.

00:18:38,354 --> 00:18:40,356
It's a leafy herb
from Thailand.

00:18:40,356 --> 00:18:42,491
Makes the ingestor
irritable and on edge.

00:18:42,491 --> 00:18:44,360
So, Barlow was drugged.

00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,196
Might explain why he attacked
Graham Deveraux last night.

00:18:47,196 --> 00:18:49,565
In high doses, that
herb can be fatal.

00:18:49,565 --> 00:18:52,368
So, what if someone
tried to poison him,

00:18:52,368 --> 00:18:53,769
but it didn't work,

00:18:53,769 --> 00:18:56,705
so the killer had
to stab him instead?

00:18:56,705 --> 00:18:58,874
Plausible theory.
Mm-hmm.

00:18:58,874 --> 00:19:02,278
Oh, uh, where are you
and Elisabetta registered?

00:19:02,278 --> 00:19:04,747
I wanted to make sure that
I got you something you need.

00:19:04,747 --> 00:19:06,515
That's very kind of you.

00:19:06,515 --> 00:19:09,485
But, honestly,
I have no idea.

00:19:09,485 --> 00:19:12,254
Elisabetta is in charge
of all things nuptial.

00:19:12,254 --> 00:19:14,390
Really?
All I got to do is get
to the church on time.

00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:15,891
That's funny.

00:19:15,891 --> 00:19:19,361
I always thought of you as
a detail-oriented kind of guy.

00:19:19,361 --> 00:19:20,796
And yet, you're not
even interested

00:19:20,796 --> 00:19:23,365
in planning the most
important day of your life?

00:19:23,365 --> 00:19:25,601
Well, work keeps me very busy.

00:19:25,601 --> 00:19:27,736
Can I give you some advice,

00:19:27,736 --> 00:19:31,240
coming from somebody who's been
down the aisle a couple times?

00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,376
You should, um...
you should get involved.

00:19:34,376 --> 00:19:35,644
You should have an opinion.

00:19:35,644 --> 00:19:37,279
You know, band, DJ.

00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:38,914
Roses, lilies.

00:19:38,914 --> 00:19:41,450
I know it may not
seem important,

00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:44,720
but if the groom does not
really care about the wedding,

00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,390
it makes the bride feel like
you don't really care about her.

00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:51,193
It's... symbolic.

00:20:03,472 --> 00:20:06,375
Analyzed the tool marks
on Barlow's rib cage.

00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:09,345
Turns out, he was stabbed
by his own knife.

00:20:09,345 --> 00:20:11,380
Guess the, uh, chefs
all have their own

00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,581
distinct set of knives.

00:20:12,581 --> 00:20:13,916
They're all kept
in the kitchen.

00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:17,553
Where anyone in the cast
or crew has access.

00:20:17,553 --> 00:20:21,857
Doesn't help us narrow down
our list of suspects at all.

00:20:21,857 --> 00:20:24,293
But this might.

00:20:24,293 --> 00:20:25,961
Curtis LeBlanc,
one of the contestants.

00:20:25,961 --> 00:20:27,830
But according
to that, he used

00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:28,964
to be Curtis Gant.

00:20:28,964 --> 00:20:30,299
It looks like

00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:32,201
Mr. Cordon Bleu has a record.

00:20:32,201 --> 00:20:35,304
Back in 2001,
he served four years

00:20:35,304 --> 00:20:36,705
for possession
with intent to sell.

00:20:36,705 --> 00:20:38,407
Didn't the show
do a background check?

00:20:38,407 --> 00:20:40,843
Well, according to the
producer, just cursory ones.

00:20:40,843 --> 00:20:43,245
Mainly to validate
culinary history.

00:20:43,245 --> 00:20:45,848
But if Curtis lied to the show
about his criminal past,

00:20:45,848 --> 00:20:48,183
that would be cause
for elimination.

00:20:48,183 --> 00:20:50,219
Maybe Barlow found out
about Curtis's secret,

00:20:50,219 --> 00:20:51,587
threatened to expose him.

00:20:51,587 --> 00:20:53,956
Now <i>that</i> would be
motive for murder.

00:20:53,956 --> 00:20:56,692
I perfected my craft in kitchens
all over the world.

00:20:56,692 --> 00:20:58,193
It's my time now.

00:20:58,193 --> 00:21:00,229
No one's gonna stand in my way.

00:21:02,598 --> 00:21:06,235
RUSSELL:
Well, congratulations,
Mr. LeBlanc.

00:21:06,235 --> 00:21:08,537
Word on the street is
you're the odds-on favorite

00:21:08,537 --> 00:21:09,705
to win <i>Elite Chef.</i>

00:21:10,906 --> 00:21:12,408
Not bad for an ex-con

00:21:12,408 --> 00:21:14,410
who honed his culinary skills
making vats

00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:17,279
of mystery meat stew
in the federal pen.

00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:19,515
Of course, you were
Curtis Gant back then.

00:21:22,184 --> 00:21:24,186
Look, I-I was, um...

00:21:24,186 --> 00:21:26,488
I was a new man
when I got out.

00:21:26,488 --> 00:21:29,191
A better man, so...
so I changed my name.

00:21:29,191 --> 00:21:30,859
RUSSELL: But you
didn't tell the show.

00:21:30,859 --> 00:21:33,462
You actually lied
about your criminal past.

00:21:33,462 --> 00:21:35,864
And if they had found out,
you would have been kicked off.

00:21:35,864 --> 00:21:38,667
You would have lost your shot
at a half a million dollars.

00:21:38,667 --> 00:21:41,270
Only one person on the
show knew your secret.

00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,871
That was your buddy,
Derek Barlow.

00:21:42,871 --> 00:21:45,207
As it turns out,
you guys go way back.

00:21:45,207 --> 00:21:48,744
You were frat brothers at
Brassard University in Florida.

00:21:48,744 --> 00:21:50,746
Friends ever since.

00:21:50,746 --> 00:21:52,881
Even roommates
here on the show.

00:21:52,881 --> 00:21:55,484
But, I mean, let's face it.

00:21:55,484 --> 00:21:57,219
Half a million dollars--

00:21:57,219 --> 00:22:01,190
that could turn even the best
of friends into enemies.

00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:02,524
What happened?

00:22:02,524 --> 00:22:04,493
Barlow threatened
to expose your secret?

00:22:04,493 --> 00:22:07,496
Is that why you killed him?

00:22:07,496 --> 00:22:10,766
We know that you tried to
poison him earlier in the day.

00:22:10,766 --> 00:22:13,502
We found trace amounts
of the herb kratom

00:22:13,502 --> 00:22:14,770
in his stomach contents.

00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:16,472
You special-ordered it

00:22:16,472 --> 00:22:19,608
from Thailand two weeks ago,
so give me a break.

00:22:19,608 --> 00:22:21,810
But that didn't kill him,
so you lured him

00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:24,813
into the kitchen
and you stabbed him to death.

00:22:27,783 --> 00:22:29,618
CURTIS:
<i>I didn't kill Derek.</i>

00:22:29,618 --> 00:22:31,654
<i>I wasn't even in</i>
<i>the kitchen last night.</i>

00:22:31,654 --> 00:22:33,789
I didn't stab him and I
wasn't trying to poison him.

00:22:33,789 --> 00:22:35,424
I just...

00:22:35,424 --> 00:22:39,395
I gave him a little kratom
to-to make him sick,

00:22:39,395 --> 00:22:41,530
to throw him
off his game.

00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:44,967
Derek was always
better than me...

00:22:44,967 --> 00:22:46,535
at everything.

00:22:46,535 --> 00:22:48,570
Even on the show, he was
winning every challenge.

00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:51,240
I... just needed an edge.

00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:54,810
So, after you edged out Derek,
where did you go?

00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:56,378
Back to our room.

00:22:56,378 --> 00:22:57,413
How long did you stay there?

00:22:57,413 --> 00:22:58,414
All night.

00:22:58,414 --> 00:23:00,249
Drank till I passed out.

00:23:00,249 --> 00:23:02,484
Look, I-I wasn't trying
to get Derek eliminated.

00:23:02,484 --> 00:23:05,354
I just wanted to win.

00:23:07,823 --> 00:23:09,758
Nice digs
for a reality show.

00:23:11,293 --> 00:23:14,730
So Derek Barlow
was killed in the kitchen

00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:16,699
sometime between
10:00 and 6:00,

00:23:16,699 --> 00:23:18,534
which means Curtis LeBlanc
could have left

00:23:18,534 --> 00:23:20,936
this room anytime
during that window

00:23:20,936 --> 00:23:22,738
and the cameras
wouldn't have picked him up.

00:23:22,738 --> 00:23:26,175
Barlow was stabbed
multiple times, dismembered.

00:23:26,175 --> 00:23:27,943
Must have been a lot of blood.

00:23:27,943 --> 00:23:29,945
Killer would have definitely
gotten some on him.

00:23:29,945 --> 00:23:32,715
Let's see if LeBlanc
took some to go.

00:23:32,715 --> 00:23:34,450
♪ ♪

00:23:56,839 --> 00:23:59,641
♪ ♪

00:24:06,548 --> 00:24:08,650
Morgan, look at this.

00:24:10,486 --> 00:24:12,855
A fingerprint in blood.

00:24:12,855 --> 00:24:15,858
Looks like it might have
been used as a weapon.

00:24:15,858 --> 00:24:18,193
Didn't Barlow have a blunt
force trauma to his head?

00:24:18,193 --> 00:24:19,561
Two days before
he was killed.

00:24:19,561 --> 00:24:22,965
Maybe that's when Barlow
threatened to go

00:24:22,965 --> 00:24:24,500
to the executive producers

00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,401
and tell them about
Curtis's prison time.

00:24:26,401 --> 00:24:28,370
They got into a fight.

00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:29,772
No, no, no...
Hey, hey.
FINLAY:
<i>Then it got physical.</i>

00:24:29,772 --> 00:24:31,607
What are you
gonna do, huh?

00:24:32,775 --> 00:24:34,543
BRODY:
<i>After the fight,</i>

00:24:34,543 --> 00:24:36,612
Barlow promises
to keep his mouth shut,

00:24:36,612 --> 00:24:38,480
but Curtis can't take
the chance,

00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,648
<i>so two nights later...</i>

00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:43,218
(choking)

00:24:43,218 --> 00:24:45,587
LeBlanc may have cleaned up
the kitchen, but he left

00:24:45,587 --> 00:24:47,222
a mess here.

00:24:47,222 --> 00:24:48,791
Could send him right
back to prison.

00:24:54,396 --> 00:24:56,632
The alarm clock that we found
under Curtis LeBlanc's bed?

00:24:56,632 --> 00:24:58,700
Blood on it belonged to
the victim Derek Barlow.

00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,402
Was the fingerprint
LeBlanc's?

00:25:00,402 --> 00:25:02,404
No, but it did match another
one of the contestants.

00:25:02,404 --> 00:25:05,240
Huh, Michelle Rowlands.

00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,809
She's kind of the underdog
on the show.

00:25:06,809 --> 00:25:08,210
She's tough.

00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:09,778
Tough enough to
commit murder?

00:25:09,778 --> 00:25:11,914
I miss my daughter so much.

00:25:11,914 --> 00:25:13,782
Losing is not an option.

00:25:13,782 --> 00:25:15,250
Michelle, I'm impressed.

00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:17,219
You made it
to the final four

00:25:17,219 --> 00:25:19,655
of an elite culinary
competition.

00:25:19,655 --> 00:25:21,423
You're a diner chef
from Ohio.

00:25:21,423 --> 00:25:23,325
And a woman.

00:25:23,325 --> 00:25:25,594
I mean, I worked twice as hard
as the guys to get where I am.

00:25:25,594 --> 00:25:26,962
BRODY:
Yeah, I hear

00:25:26,962 --> 00:25:28,931
the culinary world can be
a bit of a boys club.

00:25:28,931 --> 00:25:30,332
(chuckles)

00:25:30,332 --> 00:25:31,633
That's an
understatement.

00:25:31,633 --> 00:25:34,403
And Derek Barlow is
their poster boy.

00:25:34,403 --> 00:25:37,639
We know that he sabotaged you
more than once.

00:25:37,639 --> 00:25:38,807
You must have been
very happy

00:25:38,807 --> 00:25:40,509
when Derek was kicked off
the show.

00:25:40,509 --> 00:25:41,910
He got what he deserved.

00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:44,246
In more ways than one.

00:25:44,246 --> 00:25:48,550
We found this alarm clock
in Curtis and Derek's room.

00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:51,687
That there is your fingerprint
in Derek's blood.

00:25:51,687 --> 00:25:53,555
FINLAY:
What happened, Michelle?

00:25:53,555 --> 00:25:56,258
Had you had enough
of his abuse?

00:25:56,258 --> 00:25:59,428
Decide to get back at him
for how he treated you?

00:25:59,428 --> 00:26:01,830
You obviously got
into an altercation with him

00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:04,867
in his room,
and two days later he's dead.

00:26:04,867 --> 00:26:06,235
I didn't kill him.

00:26:06,235 --> 00:26:08,704
BRODY: You had
motive, opportunity,

00:26:08,704 --> 00:26:10,672
and you certainly had
the skill set

00:26:10,672 --> 00:26:12,941
to cut him up
and cook him.

00:26:12,941 --> 00:26:14,476
It's premeditated murder.

00:26:16,778 --> 00:26:18,647
A cou... a couple
nights ago,

00:26:18,647 --> 00:26:20,749
Derek invited
me to his room.

00:26:20,749 --> 00:26:22,284
Curtis wasn't there.

00:26:22,284 --> 00:26:24,519
He said he wanted
to form an alliance.

00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:26,955
He gave me a drink.

00:26:26,955 --> 00:26:28,924
Tasted like licorice.

00:26:28,924 --> 00:26:32,494
There must have been something
in it, because next thing

00:26:32,494 --> 00:26:36,265
I knew, I woke up and...

00:26:36,265 --> 00:26:38,267
Derek was on top of me.

00:26:38,267 --> 00:26:40,602
<i>His hand around my throat.</i>

00:26:40,602 --> 00:26:42,337
No, stop, please, stop!

00:26:42,337 --> 00:26:43,805
Shut up.

00:26:43,805 --> 00:26:45,540
MICHELLE:
<i>I couldn't get him off of me,</i>

00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,342
<i>so I grabbed the alarm clock</i>
<i>and...</i>

00:26:47,342 --> 00:26:49,578
(screams)

00:26:49,578 --> 00:26:52,447
<i>...then I got out of there.</i>

00:26:52,447 --> 00:26:54,216
Well, how come

00:26:54,216 --> 00:26:56,618
you didn't contact
the police, Ms. Rowlands?

00:26:56,618 --> 00:26:59,821
It was just the two
of us in there.

00:26:59,821 --> 00:27:02,190
It would have been
my word against his.

00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:04,459
Besides...

00:27:04,459 --> 00:27:07,195
a female chef accusing
a male chef of rape?

00:27:08,864 --> 00:27:10,599
I would have never
worked again.

00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:12,367
You know, I gave up

00:27:12,367 --> 00:27:14,503
everything to be here.

00:27:14,503 --> 00:27:17,739
You know, quit my job,
used up my savings.

00:27:17,739 --> 00:27:19,574
Weeks away from my daughter.

00:27:20,876 --> 00:27:23,712
All of it would have
been for nothing.

00:27:23,712 --> 00:27:25,547
(sniffles)

00:27:25,547 --> 00:27:28,283
You know, I'm not sorry
Derek is dead.

00:27:29,384 --> 00:27:32,187
But I didn't kill him.

00:27:32,187 --> 00:27:34,489
SANDERS:
<i>So, this was shot</i>

00:27:34,489 --> 00:27:36,892
two days before Derek Barlow
was murdered.

00:27:36,892 --> 00:27:38,460
According to
Michelle Rowlands,

00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:41,596
the rape happened
just before 10:00 p.m.

00:27:41,596 --> 00:27:44,232
If she's telling
the truth.

00:27:44,232 --> 00:27:45,934
Well, there she is.

00:27:45,934 --> 00:27:48,503
She looks pretty upset.

00:27:48,503 --> 00:27:49,905
I'd believe her.

00:27:49,905 --> 00:27:51,807
But this does not clear her
of Barlow's murder.

00:27:51,807 --> 00:27:54,509
If anything, it gives her
a stronger motive.

00:27:54,509 --> 00:27:56,511
Well, she already
hated the guy.

00:27:56,511 --> 00:27:58,747
This might have pushed her
over the edge.

00:27:58,747 --> 00:28:00,515
Let's look for evidence,
see if we're right.

00:28:02,718 --> 00:28:04,419
Whoa, hang on a sec.
Yeah.

00:28:04,419 --> 00:28:06,788
That's Barlow's roommate
Curtis LeBlanc,

00:28:06,788 --> 00:28:09,257
just minutes after
Michelle left the room.

00:28:09,257 --> 00:28:10,926
But she said he wasn't
in the room that night.

00:28:10,926 --> 00:28:12,761
Michelle was drugged.

00:28:12,761 --> 00:28:14,930
Curtis could have raped her
while she was unconscious,

00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:17,566
then been in the bathroom
while Derek had his turn.

00:28:17,566 --> 00:28:19,835
These guys are worse
than we thought.

00:28:21,303 --> 00:28:24,473
So, this one is called
Tropical Desire.

00:28:24,473 --> 00:28:27,209
Yellow butter cake
with Meyer lemon curd

00:28:27,209 --> 00:28:30,412
and key lime mouse--
mousse.

00:28:31,513 --> 00:28:34,716
Hmm... it's tart.

00:28:34,716 --> 00:28:37,386
I thought it was
light and refreshing,

00:28:37,386 --> 00:28:38,954
not so sweet.

00:28:38,954 --> 00:28:41,556
Well, I mean, if-if you
like it, then we should go

00:28:41,556 --> 00:28:42,557
with that one.

00:28:42,557 --> 00:28:44,326
We both need to like it.

00:28:44,326 --> 00:28:47,963
The wedding cake is like
<i>il simbolo del nostro amore.</i>

00:28:47,963 --> 00:28:50,298
In Italy, when the bride
and the groom

00:28:50,298 --> 00:28:52,868
feed each other cake,
it tells the world that

00:28:52,868 --> 00:28:54,836
they will take care
each other forever.

00:28:54,836 --> 00:28:57,439
Can't we tell the
world with a flan?

00:28:57,439 --> 00:29:00,242
'Cause I'm-I'm not
a big cake guy.

00:29:00,242 --> 00:29:01,943
Wow, those look amazing.

00:29:01,943 --> 00:29:03,845
You want to help
us sample some?

00:29:03,845 --> 00:29:06,381
We're trying to
make a decision.

00:29:06,381 --> 00:29:09,551
Oh, no, no, that's something
that only you two can choose.

00:29:09,551 --> 00:29:13,288
So, Elisabetta, is your family
coming over for the wedding?

00:29:13,288 --> 00:29:14,956
Of course.

00:29:14,956 --> 00:29:17,492
My parents, brothers,

00:29:17,492 --> 00:29:19,528
few of my cousins, <i>la mia nonna.</i>

00:29:19,528 --> 00:29:20,862
She has a big family.

00:29:20,862 --> 00:29:22,697
Oh, must be hard to be
so far away from them.

00:29:22,697 --> 00:29:23,698
ELISABETTA:
Ah, yeah.

00:29:23,698 --> 00:29:25,567
I miss them so much,

00:29:25,567 --> 00:29:28,503
but no, living here--
it's not forever,

00:29:28,503 --> 00:29:29,771
<i>solo temporanea.</i>

00:29:29,771 --> 00:29:31,206
Temporary?

00:29:31,206 --> 00:29:33,675
Uh, uh, what
do you mean?

00:29:33,675 --> 00:29:38,580
Of course we will have babies
and we move back to Italy.

00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:41,416
HODGES:
Honey, I-I thought
you liked it here.

00:29:41,416 --> 00:29:43,351
Las Vegas is
an amazing city,

00:29:43,351 --> 00:29:45,854
but it's no place
to raise a family.

00:29:45,854 --> 00:29:47,189
Yeah, but listen.

00:29:47,189 --> 00:29:49,191
I-I've built a career here.

00:29:49,191 --> 00:29:50,926
It's just a job, David.

00:29:50,926 --> 00:29:54,429
My father said you can work at
the vineyard with my brothers.

00:29:54,429 --> 00:29:55,597
(scoffs)

00:29:55,597 --> 00:29:58,867
I'm a highly
trained scientist.

00:29:58,867 --> 00:30:00,769
I have helped put serial
killers behind bars,

00:30:00,769 --> 00:30:02,771
and y-you want me

00:30:02,771 --> 00:30:04,506
to go stomp grapes
for a living?

00:30:04,506 --> 00:30:06,775
La Dolce Vita
is not about work.

00:30:09,611 --> 00:30:11,480
I'm sorry, we shouldn't
argue in front of you.

00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,381
It's okay,
a couple needs

00:30:13,381 --> 00:30:16,651
to iron out these details
before they go down the aisle.

00:30:16,651 --> 00:30:19,321
I wish I had done that
with my first husband.

00:30:19,321 --> 00:30:20,755
When we first got together,

00:30:20,755 --> 00:30:23,525
it was very romantic--
very much like you two.

00:30:23,525 --> 00:30:25,494
Where did you guys meet?

00:30:25,494 --> 00:30:28,196
We met
at a forensics seminar.

00:30:28,196 --> 00:30:30,432
Ended up ditching,
spent the whole week together,

00:30:30,432 --> 00:30:33,502
and then, a month later,
we got engaged.

00:30:33,502 --> 00:30:37,172
And then, uh, we got
married and real life

00:30:37,172 --> 00:30:38,840
set in, and...

00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,876
as much as we loved each other,

00:30:40,876 --> 00:30:42,777
we were still very,
very different people

00:30:42,777 --> 00:30:46,314
with different goals
and different needs and...

00:30:47,782 --> 00:30:49,651
Just wasn't meant to be.

00:30:49,651 --> 00:30:52,220
(chuckles softly)

00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:56,658
I'm thinking, uh, white
chocolate raspberry symphony.

00:30:56,658 --> 00:30:58,593
Anybody else?

00:31:04,966 --> 00:31:06,568
I'm sorry to have
to tell you that,

00:31:06,568 --> 00:31:08,570
in light
of the ongoing investigation,

00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:10,772
legal has decided
to shut us down

00:31:10,772 --> 00:31:12,274
for the remainder
of the season.

00:31:12,274 --> 00:31:14,242
I'm sorry,
you have been

00:31:14,242 --> 00:31:17,646
an exceptional crew,
and you will all be paid

00:31:17,646 --> 00:31:19,281
for the next
two weeks.

00:31:19,281 --> 00:31:21,383
In the meantime, uh,
let's strike the sets

00:31:21,383 --> 00:31:24,286
and get rid of
all the perishables.

00:31:24,286 --> 00:31:25,554
(indistinct chatter)

00:31:25,554 --> 00:31:27,489
I'm so sorry.

00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:30,959
(woman screams in distance)

00:31:30,959 --> 00:31:32,294
Excuse me.

00:31:32,294 --> 00:31:33,728
Excuse me, excuse me.

00:31:33,728 --> 00:31:35,864
What's going on?

00:31:35,864 --> 00:31:37,766
WOMAN:
Who is it?

00:31:41,836 --> 00:31:43,805
SANDERS:
Blunt force trauma to the head.

00:31:43,805 --> 00:31:47,842
Makes Curtis LeBlanc the second
chef murdered this week.

00:31:47,842 --> 00:31:49,477
Killer competition.

00:31:56,518 --> 00:31:58,820
(sniffs)

00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,422
Smells like soda.

00:32:00,422 --> 00:32:01,823
There's some trace
in this wound.

00:32:01,823 --> 00:32:03,358
Looks like paper.

00:32:04,459 --> 00:32:06,294
Maybe from that label.

00:32:06,294 --> 00:32:09,464
Blood, bits of flesh.

00:32:09,464 --> 00:32:11,433
Yeah, this could be
our murder weapon.

00:32:11,433 --> 00:32:13,335
You know,

00:32:13,335 --> 00:32:16,571
Russell and I found evidence
that LeBlanc was in the room

00:32:16,571 --> 00:32:17,939
when Michelle Rowlands
was raped.

00:32:17,939 --> 00:32:19,307
Yeah, but she never

00:32:19,307 --> 00:32:21,676
implicated him,
just Derek Barlow.

00:32:21,676 --> 00:32:24,212
Maybe because she wanted
to take care of him herself.

00:32:27,582 --> 00:32:28,883
(yells)

00:32:34,322 --> 00:32:36,458
Two men involved
with the rape.

00:32:36,458 --> 00:32:37,759
Now they're both dead.

00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:39,694
Serving up her own justice.

00:32:44,733 --> 00:32:46,801
FINLAY:
<i>So, I checked VICAP.</i>

00:32:46,801 --> 00:32:49,904
You know, Michelle Rowlands'
rape was very well planned.

00:32:49,904 --> 00:32:52,874
On a hunch, I entered some
of the details: two men,

00:32:52,874 --> 00:32:55,944
date rape drug
and a trace of licorice.

00:32:55,944 --> 00:32:57,579
And I got nothing.

00:32:57,579 --> 00:32:59,581
Pretty unusual combination.
But then I thought

00:32:59,581 --> 00:33:02,317
there has to be other things
that taste like licorice, right?

00:33:02,317 --> 00:33:03,652
Like-like fennel.

00:33:03,652 --> 00:33:04,653
Ouzo.

00:33:04,653 --> 00:33:05,687
And anise.

00:33:05,687 --> 00:33:08,223
And then... I got this hit.

00:33:08,223 --> 00:33:10,625
Unsolved case from
over 15 years ago.

00:33:10,625 --> 00:33:13,528
College freshman
named Sally Lennon

00:33:13,528 --> 00:33:15,330
was raped and murdered

00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:17,766
at a Brassard University
music festival.

00:33:17,766 --> 00:33:20,935
Traces of GHB
and anise extract.

00:33:20,935 --> 00:33:24,306
Barlow and LeBlanc went
to the very same college.

00:33:24,306 --> 00:33:26,608
And when LeBlanc was arrested
for drug-dealing,

00:33:26,608 --> 00:33:30,478
they found his GHB
in anise extract bottles.

00:33:30,478 --> 00:33:33,648
Says here two unidentified
semen donors entered into CODIS.

00:33:33,648 --> 00:33:35,850
Did you run that
against Barlow and LeBlanc?

00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:37,419
I did.
And?

00:33:37,419 --> 00:33:39,287
They matched.

00:33:39,287 --> 00:33:42,223
So these two guys
have raped before.

00:33:42,223 --> 00:33:44,392
C.O.D. was asphyxiation

00:33:44,392 --> 00:33:45,960
due to manual strangulation.

00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:49,531
And Sally's body was found
scavenged by animals.

00:33:49,531 --> 00:33:51,199
Based on this old case,

00:33:51,199 --> 00:33:53,935
Michelle Rowlands is very
lucky to be alive.

00:33:53,935 --> 00:33:55,704
Hey, Doc.

00:33:55,704 --> 00:33:58,873
Got a C.O.D.
on Mr. LeBlanc?

00:33:58,873 --> 00:34:00,942
Not blunt force trauma.

00:34:00,942 --> 00:34:03,311
Take a look at
the esophagus here.

00:34:03,311 --> 00:34:04,379
You see this swelling?

00:34:04,379 --> 00:34:06,247
It's laryngeal edema.

00:34:06,247 --> 00:34:08,883
There's also evidence of
eosinophilia in the lungs.

00:34:09,951 --> 00:34:11,419
Anaphylaxis.

00:34:11,419 --> 00:34:12,754
According to his
medical records,

00:34:12,754 --> 00:34:14,856
he had a severe
almond allergy.

00:34:14,856 --> 00:34:18,827
Even trace amounts would've
caused his throat to swell shut,

00:34:18,827 --> 00:34:20,695
resulting in asphyxiation.

00:34:20,695 --> 00:34:23,298
But we know that he was
hit in the head with

00:34:23,298 --> 00:34:24,599
a frozen leg of lamb.

00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:26,434
Maybe, maybe not.

00:34:26,434 --> 00:34:28,970
<i>It's possible</i>
<i>that when Mr. LeBlanc started</i>

00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:31,272
<i>losing consciousness</i>
<i>from the anaphylaxis,</i>

00:34:31,272 --> 00:34:34,843
<i>he fell, hitting his head</i>
<i>on the leg of lamb.</i>

00:34:34,843 --> 00:34:37,512
He had to have known that he was
deathly allergic to almonds.

00:34:37,512 --> 00:34:38,913
How did they get
in his system?

00:34:38,913 --> 00:34:40,382
I didn't notice
any needle marks

00:34:40,382 --> 00:34:41,750
or almonds in the
stomach contents.

00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:42,684
Only soda.

00:34:44,786 --> 00:34:48,456
Morgan collected a drinking
cup from the crime scene.

00:34:52,427 --> 00:34:54,429
Hey-o.

00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:56,631
So, uh, I found
trace amounts

00:34:56,631 --> 00:34:59,300
of amygdalin and benzaldehyde
in the soda.

00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,236
BRODY:
Almond extract.

00:35:01,236 --> 00:35:04,572
Every single person on that show
knew about LeBlanc's allergy,

00:35:04,572 --> 00:35:05,874
including
Michelle Rowlands.

00:35:05,874 --> 00:35:08,443
Greg's analyzing
the cup now.

00:35:08,443 --> 00:35:10,578
Maybe he can find out
who tampered with it.

00:35:10,578 --> 00:35:11,813
Let's hope.
Yeah.

00:35:11,813 --> 00:35:13,448
Thanks.
Mmm.

00:35:13,448 --> 00:35:16,418
Hey, um...
do you have a second?

00:35:16,418 --> 00:35:18,553
Of course.

00:35:18,553 --> 00:35:21,289
(sighs)

00:35:21,289 --> 00:35:23,691
Do you...

00:35:23,691 --> 00:35:27,529
think that I'm making a huge
mistake by marrying Elisabetta?

00:35:29,497 --> 00:35:31,266
Uh...

00:35:31,266 --> 00:35:33,635
I can't tell you what to do.

00:35:35,937 --> 00:35:38,440
But I can tell you that,

00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:41,209
whatever you decide,

00:35:41,209 --> 00:35:43,745
I'm gonna be here for you.

00:35:46,748 --> 00:35:48,616
Uh, um...

00:35:48,616 --> 00:35:50,819
I should get back to work.

00:35:57,425 --> 00:35:59,928
So, um...

00:35:59,928 --> 00:36:02,730
I went to this
wedding last year.

00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:05,900
They wrote their own vows,
which was kind of funny.

00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:09,671
But the groom...

00:36:09,671 --> 00:36:12,907
he said something that just...

00:36:12,907 --> 00:36:16,544
man, it stuck with me.

00:36:16,544 --> 00:36:18,546
"Never marry the one

00:36:18,546 --> 00:36:21,316
"that you think
you can live with.

00:36:23,418 --> 00:36:27,322
Marry the one you know
you can't live without."

00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:34,629
SANDERS:
<i>I figured out the source</i>

00:36:34,629 --> 00:36:36,831
of the almond extract
that killed Curtis LeBlanc.

00:36:36,831 --> 00:36:38,399
It wasn't his drink.

00:36:38,399 --> 00:36:39,901
It was his straw.

00:36:39,901 --> 00:36:42,237
<i>Hidden inside was</i>

00:36:42,237 --> 00:36:45,206
<i>a sugar straw laced</i>
<i>with almond extract,</i>

00:36:45,206 --> 00:36:48,776
<i>made precisely to fit</i>
<i>inside Curtis LeBlanc's straw.</i>

00:36:48,776 --> 00:36:51,212
He would have never noticed it.

00:36:51,212 --> 00:36:54,415
So when he took a sip
of the soda,

00:36:54,415 --> 00:36:56,317
it passed
through the sugar straw,

00:36:56,317 --> 00:36:59,320
picking up trace amounts
of almond extract,

00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,855
which then entered
into his system.

00:37:00,855 --> 00:37:02,190
His throat swelled up.

00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:03,591
Good night, Curtis.

00:37:03,591 --> 00:37:05,660
But here's the thing:
when rolling sugar,

00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:07,295
no matter how careful you are,

00:37:07,295 --> 00:37:10,565
<i>it's hard not to leave</i>
<i>an impression.</i>

00:37:10,565 --> 00:37:12,467
Tell me you got a print.

00:37:12,467 --> 00:37:14,569
Better than that,
I got a match.

00:37:14,569 --> 00:37:16,571
Ms. Bradley,
as a producer, I assumed

00:37:16,571 --> 00:37:19,374
you worked your way up the ranks
in television, but...

00:37:19,374 --> 00:37:22,510
as it turns out, you're
a classically trained chef.

00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:25,280
I took courses at the
Culinary Institute of America.

00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,781
Ah, so you learned, uh,

00:37:26,781 --> 00:37:29,918
all about cooking, you know,
from butchering to baking.

00:37:29,918 --> 00:37:32,387
Yeah, I've always been
fascinated with how chefs

00:37:32,387 --> 00:37:34,656
can make almost anything
out of sugar,

00:37:34,656 --> 00:37:37,692
from a sculpture
of a fire-breathing dragon

00:37:37,692 --> 00:37:40,495
to something as simple
as a straw

00:37:40,495 --> 00:37:43,765
laced with
almond extract.

00:37:43,765 --> 00:37:45,633
This is the straw
that killed

00:37:45,633 --> 00:37:47,702
Curtis LeBlanc.

00:37:47,702 --> 00:37:49,871
And that's your print.
We know you
murdered LeBlanc.

00:37:49,871 --> 00:37:52,740
We're pretty sure you
murdered Derek Barlow, too.

00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:55,310
What we didn't know was why
until we started digging

00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:58,212
into your background and
found out that your maiden name

00:37:58,212 --> 00:38:00,214
was Lennon.
Same last name

00:38:00,214 --> 00:38:04,752
as a young girl who was raped
and murdered 15 years ago--

00:38:04,752 --> 00:38:08,222
Sally Lennon,
your little sister.

00:38:08,222 --> 00:38:10,925
And the case
was never solved.

00:38:14,596 --> 00:38:17,398
When they found her, she was
wearing my favorite sweater.

00:38:17,398 --> 00:38:19,434
She was always
taking my stuff.

00:38:19,434 --> 00:38:21,836
It's the only thing
we ever fought about.

00:38:21,836 --> 00:38:23,204
(laughs)

00:38:23,204 --> 00:38:26,174
The case went cold.

00:38:26,174 --> 00:38:27,875
My parents shut down.

00:38:27,875 --> 00:38:31,312
They... they couldn't
even mention her name.

00:38:31,312 --> 00:38:33,348
Must have helped
that your college buddies,

00:38:33,348 --> 00:38:36,184
Derek and Curtis,
were there for you.

00:38:36,184 --> 00:38:37,819
You've been friends
with them ever since.

00:38:37,819 --> 00:38:40,455
When you found out what
they did to your sister,

00:38:40,455 --> 00:38:42,557
you arranged
to get them on the show.

00:38:42,557 --> 00:38:44,926
You wanted them
on your turf so that

00:38:44,926 --> 00:38:46,294
you could kill them.

00:38:46,294 --> 00:38:48,363
No.

00:38:48,363 --> 00:38:50,665
I only found out
three days ago.

00:38:50,665 --> 00:38:54,469
I was going through raw footage,
and saw Michelle coming out

00:38:54,469 --> 00:38:58,239
of Derek and Curtis's room,
half naked, crying.

00:38:58,239 --> 00:39:00,408
She told me about the rape.

00:39:00,408 --> 00:39:03,378
She'd been drugged,
tasted anise.

00:39:04,779 --> 00:39:07,248
Derek's hand was
around her throat.

00:39:07,248 --> 00:39:08,783
Sounded just like

00:39:08,783 --> 00:39:11,386
what happened to Sally.

00:39:11,386 --> 00:39:12,754
So then you confronted Derek.

00:39:12,754 --> 00:39:15,423
Oh...
You and Curtis
raped my sister,

00:39:15,423 --> 00:39:16,824
strangled her, then dumped her

00:39:16,824 --> 00:39:18,893
in the woods like
a piece of trash.

00:39:18,893 --> 00:39:21,262
Nadine, Nadine.
You pretended
to be my friend. You...

00:39:21,262 --> 00:39:23,631
You knew how hard it was for me
all these years.
I know, I know.

00:39:23,631 --> 00:39:25,533
No, no, no. No!
And the whole time,
it was you!

00:39:25,533 --> 00:39:27,735
(grunting)

00:39:29,937 --> 00:39:31,439
(gasps)

00:39:34,342 --> 00:39:37,345
CRAWFORD: I get why
you wanted Derek Barlow dead,

00:39:37,345 --> 00:39:38,746
but you didn't just kill him.

00:39:38,746 --> 00:39:42,417
You carved him up,
you cooked him.

00:39:42,417 --> 00:39:45,553
You served him to people.

00:39:45,553 --> 00:39:49,190
My sister was ripped apart
and eaten by animals.

00:39:51,325 --> 00:39:53,628
My parents couldn't bring
themselves to identify the body,

00:39:53,628 --> 00:39:55,463
so I had to do it.

00:39:55,463 --> 00:39:59,367
I have had that image in my head
every day for 15 years.

00:40:01,302 --> 00:40:04,772
Derek deserved
everything he got.

00:40:04,772 --> 00:40:07,675
And you wanted
to do the same thing to Curtis,

00:40:07,675 --> 00:40:09,744
but there were cops everywhere,

00:40:09,744 --> 00:40:12,914
so you had to make his death
look like an accident.

00:40:12,914 --> 00:40:15,283
I made them pay
for what they did.

00:40:17,351 --> 00:40:20,755
And I finally got
justice for my sister.

00:40:25,293 --> 00:40:26,661
(sniffles)

00:40:33,468 --> 00:40:36,337
Funny thing about Italian ice.

00:40:36,337 --> 00:40:40,808
Some scholars believe that
it wasn't invented in Italy.

00:40:40,808 --> 00:40:43,845
That it was actually
created in China.

00:40:43,845 --> 00:40:45,213
(chuckles)

00:40:47,181 --> 00:40:48,449
David...
Elisabetta...

00:40:48,449 --> 00:40:49,684
Uh...
Uh, sorry.
You go first.

00:40:49,684 --> 00:40:51,419
No, no, you go first.

00:40:51,419 --> 00:40:53,221
(sighs)

00:40:53,221 --> 00:40:55,723
I've been wanting to talk
to you about something.

00:40:55,723 --> 00:40:57,725
And I don't...

00:40:57,725 --> 00:41:00,194
know how to say
this, but, um,

00:41:00,194 --> 00:41:03,197
lately, I... I've
been feeling that...

00:41:03,197 --> 00:41:05,199
David, it's okay.

00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:07,468
I know.

00:41:07,468 --> 00:41:09,937
I've been feeling the same.

00:41:09,937 --> 00:41:14,375
You and I--
we're very different people.

00:41:14,375 --> 00:41:17,745
We both like different things.

00:41:17,745 --> 00:41:21,249
You're not happy here.

00:41:21,249 --> 00:41:23,618
You'll not be happy
in Italy, either.

00:41:23,618 --> 00:41:26,521
You'll miss your friends,

00:41:26,521 --> 00:41:28,923
you'll miss your work.

00:41:28,923 --> 00:41:32,426
(sighs) And if we were truly
meant to be together...

00:41:35,263 --> 00:41:37,732
That wouldn't matter.

00:41:37,732 --> 00:41:40,568
Unfortunately, it does.

00:41:44,605 --> 00:41:47,275
I need to go now.

00:41:47,275 --> 00:41:48,543
(sighs)

00:41:53,648 --> 00:41:55,716
Yeah.

00:42:00,655 --> 00:42:02,790
I will always love you.

00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:04,725
<i>Ti amo.</i>

00:42:15,536 --> 00:42:17,572
Ciao, David.

00:42:17,572 --> 00:42:19,207
I'm sorry.
