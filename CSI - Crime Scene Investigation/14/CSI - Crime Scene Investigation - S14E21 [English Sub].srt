00:00:37,699 --> 00:00:38,734
Mr. Berman, I've been told,

00:00:38,734 --> 00:00:40,002

Hey.

00:02:34,683 --> 00:02:36,118
Smart house, right?

00:02:36,118 --> 00:02:38,253
You walk into the room,
lights go on.

00:02:38,253 --> 00:02:39,721
You walk out,
they go off.

00:02:39,721 --> 00:02:41,189

that one
of the 18 cameras outside

00:02:47,863 --> 00:02:49,731
got a good look
at our killer.

00:02:49,731 --> 00:02:53,268
Actually, someone
outsmarted the smart house.

00:02:53,268 --> 00:02:56,004
Alarm system and surveillance
cameras were disabled

00:02:56,004 --> 00:02:58,206

00:02:58,206 --> 00:02:59,274
Remotely.

00:02:59,274 --> 00:03:01,043
The good news is,

00:03:01,043 --> 00:03:04,212
the motion sensors still tracked
the path of entry:

00:03:04,212 --> 00:03:06,214
from the garage, down the hall,

00:03:06,214 --> 00:03:08,817
through the foyer,
into the master bedroom.

00:03:08,817 --> 00:03:10,419
In and out in less
than six minutes.

00:03:10,419 --> 00:03:12,287
No wrong turns.

00:03:12,287 --> 00:03:17,893
Whoever killed Audrey Berman
was familiar with the house.

00:03:21,296 --> 00:03:24,066
D.B.

00:03:24,066 --> 00:03:27,269
First two shots were not
immediately fatal.

00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:30,772

<i>she wasn't so lucky.</i>

00:03:30,772 --> 00:03:32,007

00:03:32,007 --> 00:03:33,408
She gave it a valiant effort.

00:03:33,408 --> 00:03:36,278
Almost made it
to those doors.

00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,048
Nine-mil.

00:03:40,048 --> 00:03:42,050
Same caliber as the gun

00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:43,785
that Nick found
in Berman's car.

00:03:43,785 --> 00:03:45,787
So busy killing
his wife, he forgot

00:03:45,787 --> 00:03:47,055
to pick up the casings.

00:03:47,055 --> 00:03:49,024
Crime of passion.

00:03:49,024 --> 00:03:50,792
Could be trouble

00:03:50,792 --> 00:03:52,761
His nightstand's
completely empty.

00:03:52,761 --> 00:03:54,262
Look at hers.

00:03:55,897 --> 00:03:58,166
She also took over both sides
of the closet.

00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:00,769
So I'm thinking
that Mr. Berman moved out

00:04:00,769 --> 00:04:02,237

Lee Berman--
his wife was murdered.

to St. Thomas

00:05:55,217 --> 00:05:57,185
until the deputy director
called.

00:05:57,185 --> 00:05:58,687
Ordered me to detour
to Vegas.

00:05:58,687 --> 00:05:59,955
With all due respect,
ma'am,

00:05:59,955 --> 00:06:01,990
we're not running
a taxi service here.

00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:03,391
So why don't you save Uncle Sam
a couple of bucks

00:06:03,391 --> 00:06:05,260
and fly commercial?

00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,963
Captain, I'm gonna tell you
three things about yourself,

00:06:07,963 --> 00:06:10,098
none of which you're gonna like.

00:06:10,098 --> 00:06:12,734
Number one, there's no
such thing as an up-and-back

00:06:12,734 --> 00:06:15,237
to the Virgin Islands; you go
there, you're staying the night.

00:06:15,237 --> 00:06:17,072
And your
returning there,

00:06:17,072 --> 00:06:18,773
it's not for Mrs. Captain.

00:06:18,773 --> 00:06:20,175
Ooh.
(men chuckle)

00:06:20,175 --> 00:06:22,144
Number two, you and I
both know, morally...

00:06:22,144 --> 00:06:24,079
Okay. Wheels up.

00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:25,780
Let's get Agent Ryan
to Vegas.

00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:26,848
Grab my bags.

00:06:31,286 --> 00:06:33,755
Okay, gentlemen,
this is Las Vegas.

00:06:33,755 --> 00:06:35,190
I'll deal.

00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,858
When was the last time
you saw your wife?

00:06:36,858 --> 00:06:38,226
Yesterday morning.

00:06:39,327 --> 00:06:40,795
I got you beat.

00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:47,769
We saw her last night.

00:06:47,769 --> 00:06:49,838
I didn't kill my wife.

00:06:49,838 --> 00:06:53,241
Here's a photo of the nine-mil
we found on the front seat

00:06:53,241 --> 00:06:55,110
of your Aston Martin.

00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:57,045
These are the shell casings
that you left behind

00:06:57,045 --> 00:06:58,280
in your wife's bedroom.

00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,048
Also nine-millimeter.

00:07:00,048 --> 00:07:02,083
Now, that's the only evidence
we have of you in that room.

00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:05,153
That's because you've been
living in the guest bedroom

00:07:05,153 --> 00:07:08,056
with another piece of tail.

00:07:10,392 --> 00:07:12,260
I want to know everything
about this girl.

00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:15,330
Who is she, and where is she?

00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,832
Okay.

00:07:17,832 --> 00:07:20,936
Let me play it out for you.

00:07:20,936 --> 00:07:23,004
Your marriage is a bust.

00:07:23,004 --> 00:07:25,307
Nevada's a community property
state, right?

00:07:25,307 --> 00:07:27,309
Your wife
is going south.

00:07:27,309 --> 00:07:29,344
The new chick
is heading north.

00:07:29,344 --> 00:07:30,912
It's a classic trade-up.

00:07:30,912 --> 00:07:33,348
You kill your wife
to be with her.

00:07:33,348 --> 00:07:35,784
Now, as the comics
in the lounge act

00:07:35,784 --> 00:07:37,919
at the Tangiers
like to say,

00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,355
how am I doing?

00:07:40,355 --> 00:07:41,923
This Brass is good.

00:07:41,923 --> 00:07:43,391
And he's asking
all the right questions,

00:07:43,391 --> 00:07:46,828
just not my question.

00:07:46,828 --> 00:07:49,764
Do you mind
if we change dealers?

00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,672
Good morning, Mr. Berman.

00:07:57,672 --> 00:07:59,808
FBI Special Agent Ryan.

00:07:59,808 --> 00:08:01,643
Cyber Crimes Division.

00:08:03,845 --> 00:08:06,881
I'm not gonna ask you
if you murdered your wife.

00:08:06,881 --> 00:08:10,252
I'm more interested
in a relationship

00:08:10,252 --> 00:08:12,420
you've been having
with a woman online.

00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:17,292
Her name's Kitty, right?

00:08:20,428 --> 00:08:22,664
The way your pupils
just dilated,

00:08:22,664 --> 00:08:24,866
I'd say there was a little more
than chitchat going on

00:08:24,866 --> 00:08:26,701
in that chat.

00:08:26,701 --> 00:08:28,837
Ten-Stars-VIP.com.

00:08:28,837 --> 00:08:30,105
That ring a bell?

00:08:30,105 --> 00:08:33,408
An exclusive
VIP sex site

00:08:33,408 --> 00:08:36,978
for affluent men willing to pay
for anonymity.

00:08:38,313 --> 00:08:40,715
I could say more.

00:08:40,715 --> 00:08:42,984
Everyone with a law degree,
take a hike.

00:08:42,984 --> 00:08:44,119
MAN:
Mr. Berman,

00:08:44,119 --> 00:08:45,120
I strong...

00:08:50,859 --> 00:08:52,127
(door opens)

00:08:52,127 --> 00:08:54,863
Want to know something funny?

00:08:54,863 --> 00:08:57,332
You and I were both
seeing Kitty.

00:08:59,034 --> 00:09:02,837
So, I log in
under an assumed name, Ralph,

00:09:02,837 --> 00:09:05,073
a lonely rancher
from Montana.

00:09:05,073 --> 00:09:08,209
After about a month,
Kitty sends me a virtual gift.

00:09:08,209 --> 00:09:11,846
And when I refuse to open it,
she kicks me off the site.

00:09:11,846 --> 00:09:14,082
So back
at Quantico,

00:09:14,082 --> 00:09:15,784
I'm trying everything.

00:09:15,784 --> 00:09:18,353
I get male agents to log in
under assumed names.

00:09:18,353 --> 00:09:21,122
But even when we open
the gift,

00:09:21,122 --> 00:09:23,758
still she kicks us off the site.

00:09:23,758 --> 00:09:26,728
You want
to know why?

00:09:26,728 --> 00:09:28,830
'Cause Kitty is only interested
in wealthy men

00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,932
that she can verify.

00:09:30,932 --> 00:09:33,001
Well-known men,
like you.

00:09:33,001 --> 00:09:35,136
You opened the gift,
didn't you?

00:09:35,136 --> 00:09:38,173
I didn't get any gift.

00:09:38,173 --> 00:09:40,875
I'm a behavioral scientist.

00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:43,244
Fancy for "human lie detector."

00:09:48,183 --> 00:09:50,185
Okay.

00:09:50,185 --> 00:09:51,886
I got a gift.

00:09:56,725 --> 00:09:59,027
<i>I opened it.</i>

00:09:59,027 --> 00:10:00,862
<i>The chat box went away,</i>

No more typing.

00:10:04,299 --> 00:10:07,902
Hands-free, so to speak.

00:10:07,902 --> 00:10:09,337
How long
did this honeymoon last?

00:10:10,004 --> 00:10:11,272
A week.

00:10:11,272 --> 00:10:13,375
Ten days.

00:10:14,676 --> 00:10:16,077
Then it ended.

00:10:16,077 --> 00:10:17,979
I ended it.

00:10:17,979 --> 00:10:18,980
You're lying again.

00:10:20,849 --> 00:10:24,052
Here's my big question:

00:10:24,052 --> 00:10:26,988
What did Kitty have on you?

00:10:31,693 --> 00:10:34,796
Call my lawyers back in here.

00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:42,404
Ran facial recognition
on our mystery woman.

00:10:42,404 --> 00:10:44,139
No hits in the Nevada DMV.

00:10:44,139 --> 00:10:47,275
You're not gonna find her
in any database.

00:10:47,275 --> 00:10:49,377
It's okay; I can
help you with that.

00:10:49,377 --> 00:10:50,812
Everybody, uh,

00:10:50,812 --> 00:10:52,680
this is Special Agent Ryan.

00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:57,185
She's a cyber psychologist
specializing in cyber forensics,

00:10:57,185 --> 00:10:59,120
and I'm afraid
I don't know anything else.

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,156
May I?

00:11:10,865 --> 00:11:12,700
(beeping)

00:11:17,138 --> 00:11:18,840
Clikk, you there?

00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,042
Yes, ma'am.
Get me into Kitty.

00:11:21,042 --> 00:11:25,814
Logging into Ten-Stars-VIP.com.

00:11:25,814 --> 00:11:27,382
White label user.

00:11:27,382 --> 00:11:29,918
All I need is a name.
All right, CSI, give me a name.

00:11:29,918 --> 00:11:32,253
Hodges. That's
a good name.

00:11:32,253 --> 00:11:33,321
All right, stand up.

00:11:35,356 --> 00:11:37,058
Are you a sex site guy?

00:11:37,058 --> 00:11:38,193
No, ma'am.

00:11:38,193 --> 00:11:39,360
RYAN:
You ever been

00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,062

00:11:41,062 --> 00:11:42,363
No, ma'am.

00:11:42,363 --> 00:11:43,765
Mm, you sure
about that?

00:11:45,133 --> 00:11:46,134
First name?

00:11:46,134 --> 00:11:47,135
Uh, that would be David.

00:11:47,135 --> 00:11:48,203
Clikk,

00:11:48,203 --> 00:11:50,171

00:11:50,171 --> 00:11:51,840
STOKES (chuckles):
Oh, it's the FBI, man--

00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,007
you're toast.

00:11:53,007 --> 00:11:54,642
(Clikk whistles)

00:11:54,642 --> 00:11:56,978
A little deceptive
on the sex sites.

00:11:56,978 --> 00:11:59,314
But he's never been
to Ten-Stars-VIP.

00:11:59,314 --> 00:12:00,348
HODGES:
Okay...

00:12:00,348 --> 00:12:01,883
uh, I can explain that.

00:12:01,883 --> 00:12:03,418
I had a fiancée...

00:12:03,418 --> 00:12:05,253
At ease, stud.
Just... just fall back.

00:12:06,387 --> 00:12:08,122
You are science cops.

00:12:08,122 --> 00:12:10,658
RYAN:
I'm a cyber cop.

00:12:10,658 --> 00:12:12,894
I work crimes
that start in the mind,

00:12:12,894 --> 00:12:16,264
live online,
and play out in the real world.

00:12:16,264 --> 00:12:18,032
You work dark alleys.

00:12:18,032 --> 00:12:19,801
I work the dark Net.

00:12:21,035 --> 00:12:22,737
You chase suspects.

00:12:22,737 --> 00:12:24,372
I chase Nodes.

00:12:24,372 --> 00:12:28,209
RYAN:
"Node," short for "bad guy."

00:12:28,209 --> 00:12:31,212
Little childlike drawing.

00:12:31,212 --> 00:12:34,716
This iceberg represents
the Internet.

00:12:34,716 --> 00:12:36,651
And believe it or not,
the world only uses

00:12:36,651 --> 00:12:38,219
this top four percent.

00:12:38,219 --> 00:12:40,088
The tip.
The surface Web.

00:12:40,088 --> 00:12:43,825
I work down here,
in the 96%,

00:12:43,825 --> 00:12:45,159
in the deep Web,

00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:47,028
where criminals
are anonymous,

00:12:47,028 --> 00:12:49,163
where money is untraceable,

00:12:49,163 --> 00:12:51,199
and where everything illegal's
for sale.

00:12:51,199 --> 00:12:52,934
And what does this
have to do with Mr. Berman?

00:12:52,934 --> 00:12:55,203
Well, Berman's having
a relationship

00:12:55,203 --> 00:12:56,738
with your mystery woman,

00:12:56,738 --> 00:12:59,340
a woman named Kitty--
and Kitty...

00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,009
she's one of a kind.

00:13:02,143 --> 00:13:04,112
What's your name?

00:13:04,112 --> 00:13:05,947
Kitty.

00:13:05,947 --> 00:13:08,883
Because the more you pet me,
the more I purr.

00:13:08,883 --> 00:13:10,285
What's your name?

00:13:10,285 --> 00:13:13,087
RYAN:
David. Kitty-- ooh, I like that.

00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:15,256
KITTY:
What else do you like, David?

00:13:15,256 --> 00:13:17,292
RYAN:
Oh, I like sex.

00:13:17,292 --> 00:13:18,927
I like sex too.

00:13:18,927 --> 00:13:20,361
RYAN:
What are you into?

00:13:20,361 --> 00:13:21,996
Everything.

00:13:21,996 --> 00:13:23,298
Name it.

00:13:23,298 --> 00:13:26,901
How many legs on a bicycle?

00:13:26,901 --> 00:13:29,237
So you're a leg man?

00:13:29,237 --> 00:13:30,672
How many bicycles on a leg?

00:13:30,672 --> 00:13:32,173
You want to ride me?

Wow, she always brings it

00:13:33,775 --> 00:13:35,143

00:13:35,143 --> 00:13:36,844
Sex is her business.

00:13:36,844 --> 00:13:38,646
Now, we're gonna have
a little fun.

00:13:38,646 --> 00:13:40,982
RYAN:
I'm gonna frustrate
the algorithm

00:13:40,982 --> 00:13:42,650
with a nonresponsive response.

00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:44,419
You want to ride me?

00:13:44,419 --> 00:13:45,920
You want to ride me hard?

00:13:47,388 --> 00:13:49,023
Chain. Yank. Sweat.

00:13:49,023 --> 00:13:51,793
Wet. Bleed. Finger. Lick.

00:13:51,793 --> 00:13:53,027
Tongue. Ass. Ride.

00:13:53,027 --> 00:13:56,130
Ride. Ride. Ride. Ride.

00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:59,100

Ride. Ride. Ride. Ride. Ride...

What the hell kind
of sex site is this?

00:14:11,012 --> 00:14:13,281
RYAN:
My team has been tracking Kitty
for six weeks.

00:14:13,281 --> 00:14:16,417
She is a computer-animated
avatar chatbot

00:14:16,417 --> 00:14:18,786
with machine-learning
artificial intelligence.

00:14:18,786 --> 00:14:20,922
Okay, good, we're all
caught up now.

00:14:20,922 --> 00:14:22,290
So...

00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:24,225
she's not real.

00:14:24,225 --> 00:14:27,729
But the person
who created her is.

00:14:27,729 --> 00:14:30,031
That's why I'm here.

00:14:41,309 --> 00:14:44,012
What's with
the mushrooms?

00:14:44,012 --> 00:14:46,080
It's in my nature to nurture.

00:14:47,982 --> 00:14:49,384
I guess I threw you
a little curveball

00:14:49,384 --> 00:14:50,952
with Kitty, didn't I?
You know, all this

00:14:50,952 --> 00:14:53,921
cyber hocus-pocus
is fascinating, but...

00:14:53,921 --> 00:14:55,323
now what?

00:14:55,323 --> 00:14:57,892
I still have
a dead woman downstairs,

00:14:57,892 --> 00:15:00,662
a casino mogul
with GSR on his hands,

00:15:00,662 --> 00:15:02,063
a gun on the front seat.

00:15:02,063 --> 00:15:04,298
Up until now,
I've been thinking that

00:15:04,298 --> 00:15:06,834
Lee Berman killed
his wife for a...

00:15:06,834 --> 00:15:08,302
a younger woman online.

00:15:08,302 --> 00:15:11,005
You come along,
you tap a few keys,

00:15:11,005 --> 00:15:15,109
and then you reduce our motive
to a bunch of digital bits.

00:15:15,109 --> 00:15:16,277
So...

00:15:16,277 --> 00:15:17,879
where's that leave me?

00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:20,248
Can you cut me CSI Finlay?

00:15:20,248 --> 00:15:24,118
I'm bucking time here.
I really need to get into
the husband's computer.

00:15:24,118 --> 00:15:26,020
Why her?

00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:28,189
Men. Sex sites.

00:15:28,189 --> 00:15:30,324
They're time assassins.
Fine with me.

00:15:30,324 --> 00:15:33,227
But Lee Berman's computer
wiped out right in my hands,

00:15:33,227 --> 00:15:36,130
so...
Was a sledge hammer involved?

00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:37,799
No.

00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:41,002

You're doing great.

So Berman made a sex tape

00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:06,254
People forget
the cameras

00:17:06,254 --> 00:17:09,157
on their laptops, their tablets,
their cell phones--

00:17:09,157 --> 00:17:10,658
they're cameras.

00:17:10,658 --> 00:17:11,826
They record.

00:17:11,826 --> 00:17:13,294
I figured
if rich guys

00:17:13,294 --> 00:17:16,063
like Berman were being targeted,
money was the end game.

00:17:16,063 --> 00:17:18,332

She can't feel pain;
she's not real.

Then why is she
massaging her jaw?

00:17:45,993 --> 00:17:48,329
It's usually the sign of an
underlying medical condition.

00:19:22,089 --> 00:19:23,190
maybe long enough

00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:24,725
to transfer to his hands

00:19:24,725 --> 00:19:26,227
when he handled it last night.

00:19:26,227 --> 00:19:27,995
If the gun wasn't
the murder weapon, though,

00:19:27,995 --> 00:19:29,797
why did Berman have it
in the first place?

00:19:29,797 --> 00:19:32,767
There's got to be a reason.

00:19:32,767 --> 00:19:34,802
How's it going?

00:19:34,802 --> 00:19:36,637
Hey, good, good.

00:19:36,637 --> 00:19:39,140
Uh, I know that Greg was
jocking Berman's smart house,

00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:41,676
(chuckles):
but I don't think he saw
this smart car, man.

00:19:41,676 --> 00:19:43,144
It's amazing.

00:19:43,144 --> 00:19:45,846
It's like a detective on wheels;
you just give it

00:19:45,846 --> 00:19:48,349
a CSI badge and
a field kit.

00:19:48,349 --> 00:19:50,751
I did run diagnostics.

00:19:50,751 --> 00:19:53,154
According to CSI Aston,

00:19:53,154 --> 00:19:56,724
from the Tangiers,
Berman manually entered

00:19:56,724 --> 00:19:59,860
his GPS coordinates
at 4:15 a.m.,

00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:03,230
arriving at his destination,
Industrial Park,

00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:04,865
at 5:13 a.m.

00:20:04,865 --> 00:20:06,100
And then, of course,

00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,169
I handcuffed him at 5:37.

00:20:08,169 --> 00:20:10,304
So he was
nowhere near the scene.

00:20:10,304 --> 00:20:12,039
He couldn't
have killed his wife.

00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:14,942
But that doesn't mean
he didn't pay for it.

00:20:14,942 --> 00:20:16,243
That bag I found
in the trunk

00:20:16,243 --> 00:20:18,079
could have been used
for a money drop.

00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,383
Okay, so...
what do we think?

00:20:22,383 --> 00:20:23,784
Berman hires some guy

00:20:23,784 --> 00:20:26,187
to kill his wife,
meets him in the park

00:20:26,187 --> 00:20:28,022
an hour later
for the payoff.

00:20:28,022 --> 00:20:30,257
I mean...
that does fit the timeline.

00:20:30,257 --> 00:20:32,727
I'm not sure it fits
the logic, though.

00:20:32,727 --> 00:20:34,729
I mean, what's a guy
like Lee Berman doing

00:20:34,729 --> 00:20:36,263
driving an Aston Martin

00:20:36,263 --> 00:20:39,367
around Industrial Park
at 5:00 in the morning

00:20:39,367 --> 00:20:41,202
with a gun on his seat?

00:20:44,905 --> 00:20:46,173
Yeah...

00:20:46,173 --> 00:20:48,642
we're missing something.

00:20:51,278 --> 00:20:53,981
This may be
what you're missing.

00:20:53,981 --> 00:20:57,184
You're gonna pay,
or you're gonna pay.

00:20:57,184 --> 00:21:00,721
LEE:
A hundred thousand--
that was one thing. 250?

00:21:00,721 --> 00:21:02,423
Now you want
a half a million dollars?

00:21:02,423 --> 00:21:04,058
I'm done.

00:21:04,058 --> 00:21:05,659
You're done when
I say you're done.

00:21:05,659 --> 00:21:07,795
Now it's a million.

00:21:07,795 --> 00:21:09,930
You don't want
to play ball with me,

00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:12,066
I will kill your whole family.

00:21:12,066 --> 00:21:15,102
Who do you want to see
in a casket first,

00:21:15,102 --> 00:21:16,670
your wife or your kids?

00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:18,739
(quietly):
You leave them
out of this.

00:21:18,739 --> 00:21:20,174
Now it's $2 million.

00:21:20,174 --> 00:21:22,910
You say another word,
and it's four.

00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:26,814
Same drill-- wire the money,
convert it to bitcoins.

00:21:26,814 --> 00:21:27,982
Forget bitcoins.

00:21:27,982 --> 00:21:29,250
I want a face-to-face!

00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:32,720
LEE:
I'm in charge now! My terms!

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,221
Industrial Park
off Blue Diamond!

00:21:34,221 --> 00:21:35,823
Cash on delivery!

00:21:35,823 --> 00:21:37,358
I am ending this tonight!

00:21:37,358 --> 00:21:38,692
Aw.

00:21:38,692 --> 00:21:40,928
You do love me.

00:21:42,797 --> 00:21:45,833
FINLAY:
And that was the last time
that they spoke.

00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:47,334
Classic extortion.

00:21:47,334 --> 00:21:49,336
How does an avatar
programmed for sex

00:21:49,336 --> 00:21:51,772
turn so sadistic?
RYAN:
Kitty's not a sadist.

00:21:51,772 --> 00:21:53,707
Her creator is.
A psycho-sadist.

00:21:53,707 --> 00:21:55,409
Most likely male.

00:21:55,409 --> 00:21:58,079
He derives pleasure
from inflicting pain on others--

00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:00,815
physical, emotional,
financial.

00:22:00,815 --> 00:22:02,950
Berman didn't pay
to have his wife killed.

00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:05,386
He paid the sadist to spare her.

00:22:05,386 --> 00:22:08,022
But he didn't spare her.
She's dead.

00:22:08,022 --> 00:22:11,358
The second that Berman
initiated this power struggle

00:22:11,358 --> 00:22:15,362
with his "my terms" bravado,
the sadist got pissed.

00:22:15,362 --> 00:22:17,965
So he killed Berman's wife
and he took his money.

00:22:17,965 --> 00:22:21,135
Which means Berman's the only
person who's ever seen this guy.

00:22:21,135 --> 00:22:23,237
First you tell me
this girl is fake,

00:22:23,237 --> 00:22:25,106
and now you're
telling me the "guy"

00:22:25,106 --> 00:22:26,640
who was shaking me down

00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,742
killed my wife?
Hey, Mr. Berman,

00:22:28,742 --> 00:22:30,878
we have you on tape

00:22:30,878 --> 00:22:33,414
agreeing to pay
$2 million cash.

00:22:33,414 --> 00:22:35,416
Question is, who'd
you give it to?

00:22:35,416 --> 00:22:38,252
RYAN:
You can't pay $2 million
to a chatbot.

00:22:38,252 --> 00:22:40,187
So who'd you pay the money to?

00:22:40,187 --> 00:22:42,189
(indistinct whispering)

00:22:42,189 --> 00:22:44,225
Oh, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

00:22:45,793 --> 00:22:48,362
There never was any cash,
was there?

00:22:48,362 --> 00:22:51,632
You went to the
Industrial Park

00:22:51,632 --> 00:22:54,001
not to pay Kitty
but to kill her.

00:22:54,001 --> 00:22:56,270
And when you got there,
I'm guessing

00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:58,672
all you had was
your gun in your hand.

00:23:01,175 --> 00:23:03,377
Gun in my hand?

00:23:03,377 --> 00:23:05,112
That's a polite way to say it.

00:23:11,318 --> 00:23:12,987
<i>No one showed.</i>

00:23:15,756 --> 00:23:19,727
I didn't
say it before because...

00:23:19,727 --> 00:23:22,062
because I was ashamed.

00:23:24,131 --> 00:23:29,170
I'm fooling around
online, and...

00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:31,672
it gets my wife killed.

00:23:31,672 --> 00:23:34,341
That's the first
honest thing you've said.

00:23:37,811 --> 00:23:40,247
I'd like to thank
both the FBI and the LVPD

00:23:40,247 --> 00:23:42,283
for proving what
we knew all along.

00:23:42,283 --> 00:23:44,118
Mr. Berman is innocent.

00:23:44,118 --> 00:23:45,252
And we're out of here.

00:23:57,932 --> 00:23:59,967
Kitty?

00:23:59,967 --> 00:24:02,703
Kitty. Kitty.
It's you.

00:24:02,703 --> 00:24:05,306
What the hell
is going on?

00:24:05,306 --> 00:24:07,241
They said
she wasn't real!

00:24:07,241 --> 00:24:08,242
LAWYER:
Calm down!

00:24:08,242 --> 00:24:09,677
I'm looking for the person

00:24:09,677 --> 00:24:10,411
who gave my picture
to the press.

00:24:21,255 --> 00:24:23,691
My name is Susan McDowell.
I'm from San Diego.

00:24:23,691 --> 00:24:25,192
I'm cooking dinner
for my little girls.

00:24:25,192 --> 00:24:27,962
I look up, and I'm
all over the TV,

00:24:27,962 --> 00:24:30,297
the other woman in
a love triangle.

00:24:30,297 --> 00:24:33,200
Every story mentions the
Las Vegas Police Department.

00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,236
I drove five hours.
I want answers.

00:24:35,236 --> 00:24:38,372
I understand.
I want some myself.

00:24:39,373 --> 00:24:41,642
(clears throat)

00:24:41,642 --> 00:24:44,645
I put your photo out there.

00:24:44,645 --> 00:24:47,381
The FBI is working a case,

00:24:47,381 --> 00:24:48,916
and you're a person of interest.

00:24:48,916 --> 00:24:50,784
Person of interest?
Are you kidding me?

00:24:50,784 --> 00:24:52,319
Do you use social networks?

00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:54,188
Are you even
listening to me?

00:24:54,188 --> 00:24:57,391
I have a husband overseas
serving his country.

00:24:57,391 --> 00:24:59,994
I am trying to hold
my family together.

00:24:59,994 --> 00:25:02,129
That guy in the hall, he
is not the first person

00:25:02,129 --> 00:25:04,832
to call me Kitty.
What about Facebook?

00:25:04,832 --> 00:25:07,134
Instagram? Snapchat?

00:25:07,134 --> 00:25:08,269
Vine?

00:25:08,269 --> 00:25:09,870
Yes. I'm on Friend Agenda.

00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:11,739
My husband's stationed
in Afghanistan.

00:25:11,739 --> 00:25:14,141
It's the only way we
get to see each other.

00:25:14,141 --> 00:25:16,243
How often are you on it?

00:25:16,243 --> 00:25:17,845
Every day.

00:25:17,845 --> 00:25:21,148
I send Bradley photos
and videos of the girls.

00:25:21,148 --> 00:25:23,717
I post whatever I can to
bring our life to him.

00:25:23,717 --> 00:25:26,120
Do you grind your teeth
at night?

00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,354
How do you know that?

00:25:27,354 --> 00:25:29,056
You're massaging your jaw.

00:25:29,056 --> 00:25:31,058
You have an idiosyncratic
medical condition.

00:25:31,058 --> 00:25:34,028
I'm guessing it's TMJ.

00:25:34,028 --> 00:25:36,230
It started when my
husband deployed.

00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:37,865
It's how I knew
you were out there.

00:25:37,865 --> 00:25:41,101
And it's why
I released her photo.

00:25:41,101 --> 00:25:44,405
Ms. McDowell,
someone took your face,

00:25:44,405 --> 00:25:47,107
your body,
and your mannerisms,

00:25:47,107 --> 00:25:48,842
and they made a virtual you.

00:25:48,842 --> 00:25:52,379
They gave it a name, Kitty,
and they put it on a sex site.

00:25:52,379 --> 00:25:55,683
The guy who did it is now
making millions of dollars.

00:25:55,683 --> 00:25:57,951
How could he do that?

00:25:57,951 --> 00:26:00,854
I think we need to assess
your social vulnerability.

00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:07,695
RYAN:
This is your Friend Agenda page.

00:26:07,695 --> 00:26:10,097
Do you recognize
any of these six people?

00:26:11,799 --> 00:26:15,936
WittyGirl285 is a girl
I went to school with.

00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:18,072
BarbaraSD is an

00:26:18,072 --> 00:26:20,708
over-caffeinated mom
trying to set up a playdate.

00:26:20,708 --> 00:26:22,309
I don't know
the other four.

00:26:22,309 --> 00:26:24,712
Today, these
are the top six people

00:26:24,712 --> 00:26:26,046
who viewed your site--

00:26:26,046 --> 00:26:27,815
not your friends,
your wannabe friends.

00:26:27,815 --> 00:26:31,051
Your top hit is Nebula1.
Who's he?

00:26:31,051 --> 00:26:32,853
I have no clue.

00:26:32,853 --> 00:26:35,222
Well, he visited your site

00:26:35,222 --> 00:26:38,692
2,507 times
in the last six months.

00:26:38,692 --> 00:26:40,894
That's 15 times a day.

00:26:40,894 --> 00:26:44,398
Playdate mom?
She was there two times a week.

00:26:44,398 --> 00:26:46,166
That guy hiding behind
the smiley face--

00:26:46,166 --> 00:26:48,268
he's the one that
did this to me?

00:26:48,268 --> 00:26:50,738
2,500 times? Really?

00:26:50,738 --> 00:26:52,940
I have two little girls.

00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,775
What if this guy comes after us?

00:26:54,775 --> 00:26:57,077
I'll protect you.

00:26:57,077 --> 00:26:59,813
I give you my word.

00:27:03,183 --> 00:27:04,918
Mr. Berman?

00:27:04,918 --> 00:27:07,221
Listen, until we catch
your wife's killer,

00:27:07,221 --> 00:27:08,689
I think it would be
a good idea

00:27:08,689 --> 00:27:10,257
for you to stay
at the hotel.

00:27:10,257 --> 00:27:12,326
Little extra layer of security.

00:27:14,261 --> 00:27:17,064
I don't know what you
want to do about your dog.

00:27:17,064 --> 00:27:18,632
Dog?

00:27:18,632 --> 00:27:20,267
I don't have a dog.

00:27:23,704 --> 00:27:24,972
STOKES:
Where you going, bud?

00:27:24,972 --> 00:27:26,707
Come here.

00:27:26,707 --> 00:27:28,342
Hey.

00:27:28,342 --> 00:27:30,244
Nice pooch, Nick.

00:27:30,244 --> 00:27:31,678
Thank you.

00:27:31,678 --> 00:27:33,280
Nice pooch, Nick.
Yeah, thanks.

00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,948
Hey, so I finally
figured out

00:27:34,948 --> 00:27:37,751
how the killer knew his way
around the Berman house.

00:27:37,751 --> 00:27:40,087
Place was up for sale
a few years ago,

00:27:40,087 --> 00:27:42,356
and the, uh,
360 virtual walk-through

00:27:42,356 --> 00:27:43,924
is still online.

00:27:43,924 --> 00:27:45,959
All the killer had to do
was take the tour,

00:27:45,959 --> 00:27:47,861
and he knew every inch
of the place.
Scary.

00:27:47,861 --> 00:27:49,163
Something that
is supposed to

00:27:49,163 --> 00:27:50,764
help you sell your house
ends up being

00:27:50,764 --> 00:27:52,399
a blueprint to kill your wife.
Yeah, he'd

00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:54,868
still have to get past guard
shacks, armed security,

00:27:54,868 --> 00:27:56,203
and electronic sensor gates.

00:27:56,203 --> 00:27:58,071
It's like Shawshank
over there.

00:27:58,071 --> 00:28:01,041
I worked a grand theft
horse case there a while back.

00:28:01,041 --> 00:28:03,210
Community's zoned
for four-legged friends.

00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:04,711
Residents ride their horses

00:28:04,711 --> 00:28:06,847
in and out of there
all the time.

00:28:06,847 --> 00:28:08,348
Well, that's how he did it.

00:28:08,348 --> 00:28:10,317
Where there's a horse trail,
there's a dog trail.

00:28:10,317 --> 00:28:12,653
Maybe security
thought this guy was
just walking his dog.

00:28:12,653 --> 00:28:13,921
That's how he
got past them.

00:28:13,921 --> 00:28:15,789
Yeah, and then once onto
the Berman property,

00:28:15,789 --> 00:28:16,824
he didn't need
the dog anymore,

00:28:16,824 --> 00:28:18,058
so he let her loose.

00:28:18,058 --> 00:28:20,260
(whines)
That's okay,
sweetie.

00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:23,063
Uncle Hodges is gonna adopt you
when all this is over.

00:28:23,063 --> 00:28:25,332
No, he's not. Uncle Greg is.

00:28:25,332 --> 00:28:27,701
But I am going
to scan you

00:28:27,701 --> 00:28:29,736
with my "ARF"-ID Reader.

00:28:29,736 --> 00:28:31,805
(beep)

00:28:31,805 --> 00:28:33,140
Shelter dog.

00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:35,042
Rescued into a life of crime.

00:28:35,042 --> 00:28:37,311
Okay, get a shot of her
for me, will you?

00:28:37,311 --> 00:28:39,046
Yeah.

00:28:39,046 --> 00:28:40,280
Say cheese, sweetie.

00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,115
Cheese, sweetie.

00:28:44,651 --> 00:28:46,153
Got your text.
What do you got?

00:28:46,153 --> 00:28:47,688
Well, this is a first.

00:28:47,688 --> 00:28:50,190
Our killer adopted
a death-imminent mongrel dog.

00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:52,292
You know, a mutt.
But he made a mistake.

00:28:52,292 --> 00:28:54,895
He left a copy of his driver's
license at the dog pound.

00:28:54,895 --> 00:28:56,430
The information
is bogus,

00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:58,298
but the girl at the
counter I.D.'d the photo.

00:28:58,298 --> 00:28:59,900
So I'm looking at our killer.

00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,069
It gets better.
Nick saw a security camera

00:29:02,069 --> 00:29:04,671
in the parking
lot of the animal shelter.

00:29:04,671 --> 00:29:06,273
We ran the plate.

00:29:06,273 --> 00:29:07,975
Rental?
Affirmative.

00:29:07,975 --> 00:29:11,078
Time to LoJack this jackass.

00:29:11,078 --> 00:29:14,815
Control, this is Two Zero
Three Charlie, Captain Brass.

00:29:14,815 --> 00:29:16,350
We're at
the LoJack-identified site.

00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:18,952
Eyes on a silver Ford.
Nevada plates Adam, King,

00:29:18,952 --> 00:29:20,354
Sam, Henry, Four, One, Three.

00:29:22,689 --> 00:29:24,892
STOKES:
Key's still
in the ignition, Jim.

00:29:28,695 --> 00:29:30,397
Well, you have evidence

00:29:30,397 --> 00:29:32,032
but no one to tie it to.

00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,734
He knew that.

00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:40,240
That's why
he left it all behind.

00:29:42,309 --> 00:29:45,279
Ballistics confirmed
that's the murder weapon.

00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,247
No prints. No DNA.

00:29:47,247 --> 00:29:49,082
We tracked down
Berman's jeweler.

00:29:49,082 --> 00:29:50,250
He's the one who
identified the ring.

00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:52,052
Five-carat rock.

00:29:52,052 --> 00:29:54,655
Worth over $2 million.
RUSSELL: Great
payday for a killer.

00:29:54,655 --> 00:29:55,822
Untraceable.

00:29:55,822 --> 00:29:58,025
I also processed
the disposable phone.

00:29:58,025 --> 00:29:59,726
There were only
two numbers in memory:

00:29:59,726 --> 00:30:01,161
one from an animal shelter

00:30:01,161 --> 00:30:03,397
and one from
a rental car agency.

00:30:03,397 --> 00:30:05,732
The only thing
probative, really,

00:30:05,732 --> 00:30:07,234
is the video.

00:30:07,234 --> 00:30:10,304
Wait, there's a video on
a disposable cell phone?

00:30:10,304 --> 00:30:11,972
Oh, yeah.

00:30:11,972 --> 00:30:14,141
Play it.

00:30:27,754 --> 00:30:28,855
(gunshot)

00:30:28,855 --> 00:30:30,390
(woman grunts)

00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:32,059
(shrieks)

00:30:37,397 --> 00:30:38,932
(gunshot)

00:30:38,932 --> 00:30:40,701
(sighs)

00:30:40,701 --> 00:30:43,236
You okay?

00:30:43,236 --> 00:30:45,305
I missed it.

00:30:46,974 --> 00:30:48,275
Hey, slow down,
will you?

00:30:48,275 --> 00:30:49,643
What did you miss?

00:30:49,643 --> 00:30:51,211
Something on that snuff film?

00:30:51,211 --> 00:30:53,280
It's not a snuff film;
it's proof of kill

00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,016
sent by the hit man
to the deep Web

00:30:56,016 --> 00:30:57,884
to create a résumé
in cyberspace

00:30:57,884 --> 00:30:59,019
so he gets hired
for future hits.

00:30:59,019 --> 00:31:00,754
Wait... (exhales)
You're saying

00:31:00,754 --> 00:31:02,422
that the guy who created Kitty
is a hit man?

00:31:02,422 --> 00:31:05,659
No.
No, no, no.

00:31:05,659 --> 00:31:07,694
The man who created Kitty
is a psycho-sadist.

00:31:07,694 --> 00:31:10,063
He derives pleasure from
inflicting pain to others.

00:31:10,063 --> 00:31:13,133
He would never tape himself
killing somebody.

00:31:13,133 --> 00:31:14,635
He is the one I'm after.

00:31:14,635 --> 00:31:16,136
Don't you see?

00:31:16,136 --> 00:31:19,306
My psycho-sadist
hired your hit man.

00:31:19,306 --> 00:31:21,074
So your Node...

00:31:21,074 --> 00:31:23,310
Was never even in Vegas.
And that's what I missed.

00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:25,779
So now we're
looking for two ghosts.

00:31:25,779 --> 00:31:28,248
Mine is underground, and yours
is halfway around the world.

00:31:39,026 --> 00:31:40,861
Brass called Interpol.

00:31:40,861 --> 00:31:43,030
They put out a worldwide
broadcast on our hit man.

00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:44,364
Hopefully they'll
get a bead on him

00:31:44,364 --> 00:31:46,700
so they can drag
his ass back to Vegas.

00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,902
When's the last time you
changed your profile picture?

00:31:48,902 --> 00:31:51,038
I don't know, probably after
I shaved my beard off.

00:31:51,038 --> 00:31:53,640
Good, you're controlling
your self-image.

00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,941
So's he.

00:31:54,941 --> 00:31:57,644
Before Nebula1
was a smiley face,

00:31:57,644 --> 00:31:58,879
this is what he looked like.

00:31:58,879 --> 00:32:01,014
(laughs)
Oh, yeah,

00:32:01,014 --> 00:32:04,017
that rates really high
on the creepy meter.

00:32:04,017 --> 00:32:06,653
Nebula1-- what's that all about?

00:32:06,653 --> 00:32:08,055
Nebula means dark mist.

00:32:08,055 --> 00:32:09,356
He thinks he's
beyond our reach.

00:32:09,356 --> 00:32:11,058
Tell me, what do you see?

00:32:11,058 --> 00:32:13,827
The obvious? Um...

00:32:13,827 --> 00:32:16,096
Caucasian male, 20s,
button-up shirt,

00:32:16,096 --> 00:32:18,231
books, family
photos, window,

00:32:18,231 --> 00:32:20,667
blinds.
And from what I can tell,

00:32:20,667 --> 00:32:21,768
it's nighttime.

00:32:21,768 --> 00:32:23,070
Put it in context.

00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:24,337
Barbells

00:32:24,337 --> 00:32:26,239
on the floor.
Guy works out.

00:32:26,239 --> 00:32:28,108
He's antisocial.
He doesn't like the gym.

00:32:28,108 --> 00:32:30,243
Yeah, and he doesn't like
to take out the trash, either.

00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:34,181
(short chuckle)
Cans are stuffed.

00:32:34,181 --> 00:32:36,316
To-go cups,
food containers.

00:32:36,316 --> 00:32:38,318
He orders in a lot.
He's agoraphobic.

00:32:38,318 --> 00:32:40,087
He doesn't like to leave,
not even to eat.

00:32:40,087 --> 00:32:41,688
Well, we need
to I.D. him, right?

00:32:41,688 --> 00:32:44,224
Guy's got a lot of
family photos there.

00:32:44,224 --> 00:32:46,426
If they were his family.

00:32:46,426 --> 00:32:47,994
What do you mean?

00:32:47,994 --> 00:32:49,830
Blood is thicker
than water, but it's not

00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:51,064
thicker than
a watermark.

00:32:51,064 --> 00:32:52,666
Back up the bus.

00:32:52,666 --> 00:32:54,334
He downloaded
a fake family?

00:32:54,334 --> 00:32:56,036
Everything you see
here is staged.

00:32:56,036 --> 00:32:58,638
Family photos communicate
that he's a good person.

00:32:58,638 --> 00:33:00,107
Books are supposed
to make us believe

00:33:00,107 --> 00:33:02,075
that he's intelligent.
Blinds are closed

00:33:02,075 --> 00:33:03,877
so we don't know
where he lives.

00:33:03,877 --> 00:33:05,746
Hmm.

00:33:05,746 --> 00:33:07,114
Why did you say
it was nighttime?

00:33:07,114 --> 00:33:08,849
I don't know.
I mean, I can see

00:33:08,849 --> 00:33:10,851
stars through the blinds.

00:33:10,851 --> 00:33:11,985
What, he stage those too?

00:33:11,985 --> 00:33:13,920
No. No. That's an oversight.

00:33:15,021 --> 00:33:16,690
(computer chirping)

00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:18,658
It's gestalt theory
of continuation.

00:33:23,263 --> 00:33:24,798
Looks like an arch.

00:33:24,798 --> 00:33:26,233
It's the Gateway Arch.

00:33:26,233 --> 00:33:27,868
He's in St. Louis.

00:33:27,868 --> 00:33:29,936
I'll triangulate
coordinates.

00:33:37,277 --> 00:33:38,278
Clear!

00:33:39,846 --> 00:33:42,015
Clear!
Clear? What do you mean,
"clear"?

00:33:42,015 --> 00:33:43,884
No suspect on the premises.

00:33:43,884 --> 00:33:46,219
Ma'am, you need to see this.

00:33:48,355 --> 00:33:50,991
We've got a whole
nerve center here.

00:33:50,991 --> 00:33:53,693
Computers, hard drives,
the works.

00:33:53,693 --> 00:33:56,797
STOKES:
Oh, looks like he's
still in business, but

00:33:56,797 --> 00:33:59,166
if he never leaves the house,
then where is he?

00:33:59,166 --> 00:34:00,267
Give me the ceiling.

00:34:00,267 --> 00:34:01,735
All four corners.

00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,742
He's got a Web cam!

00:34:08,742 --> 00:34:09,943
He's watching us! It's a trap!

00:34:09,943 --> 00:34:10,944
Get out! Extract! Extract!

00:34:10,944 --> 00:34:12,813
Go! Go! Everybody out! Go!

00:34:12,813 --> 00:34:15,248
(shouting, explosion)

00:34:15,248 --> 00:34:17,150
(static)

00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:19,119
(sighs)

00:34:24,958 --> 00:34:27,260
Figured I'd find you out here.

00:34:32,299 --> 00:34:35,869
Hey, you saved all
those men's lives today.

00:34:35,869 --> 00:34:39,172
Unfortunately, the evidence
didn't fare so well.

00:34:39,172 --> 00:34:41,708
We lost DNA, prints.

00:34:41,708 --> 00:34:44,244
All the hardware
was incinerated.

00:34:46,379 --> 00:34:49,983
Oh. Is that right, D.B.?

00:34:49,983 --> 00:34:51,985
Well, yes, Avery, it is.

00:34:51,985 --> 00:34:55,288
I found a photo

00:34:55,288 --> 00:34:57,657
of Susan's house on her phone.

00:34:57,657 --> 00:35:00,360
She never posted it
to Friend Agenda.

00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,829
If I upload it,
he'll know where she lives.

00:35:02,829 --> 00:35:04,331
You're thinking
of putting her in play?

00:35:04,331 --> 00:35:06,066
I applied some pressure.

00:35:06,066 --> 00:35:09,202
I got an agoraphobe
to leave his house.

00:35:09,202 --> 00:35:11,204
We could lure him.

00:35:11,204 --> 00:35:14,207
He is moveable.

00:35:14,207 --> 00:35:16,209
And now you want
to move him again

00:35:16,209 --> 00:35:17,844
and use Susan to do it.

00:35:17,844 --> 00:35:19,212
(Ryan sighs)

00:35:19,212 --> 00:35:21,348
But you're on the fence
about it?

00:35:21,348 --> 00:35:23,183
The Internet
amplifies crime.

00:35:23,183 --> 00:35:24,951
If my Node gets
away with this,

00:35:24,951 --> 00:35:27,220
his cyber cred
will be immortalized.

00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:30,924
He will spawn hundreds, if not
thousands, of copycatters.

00:35:30,924 --> 00:35:34,027
So it's Susan
versus the greater good.

00:35:34,027 --> 00:35:37,130
I looked that woman in the eye,

00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:39,099
and I promised her

00:35:39,099 --> 00:35:41,101
I would protect her.

00:35:41,101 --> 00:35:44,771
We are talking about a woman
and two little girls.

00:35:47,207 --> 00:35:49,142
Do you want my opinion?

00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:57,083
Greater good.
Put her in play.

00:35:57,083 --> 00:35:59,019
I've got you covered.

00:36:08,094 --> 00:36:13,633
(camera shutters clicking)
My name is Susan McDowell.

00:36:13,633 --> 00:36:17,170
My husband's a Marine
proudly serving in Afghanistan.

00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:20,807
I am a mother of two girls.

00:36:20,807 --> 00:36:24,978
I thought I was tough,
that I could handle anything.

00:36:24,978 --> 00:36:27,314
Then someone hacked
into my life,

00:36:27,314 --> 00:36:29,916
hijacked all my photos online,

00:36:29,916 --> 00:36:31,384
used my likeness,

00:36:31,384 --> 00:36:33,920
my face, my body,

00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:38,091
put me on the Internet,
where I was virtually raped

00:36:38,091 --> 00:36:40,694
by thousands of men.

00:36:40,694 --> 00:36:42,729
There is no law against
what this man did to me.

00:36:42,729 --> 00:36:44,731
There is no law against
what this man did to me.

00:36:44,731 --> 00:36:46,866
But I was violated.

00:36:46,866 --> 00:36:48,101
Virtual rape...

00:36:48,101 --> 00:36:49,703
Is rape.
SUSAN:
...is rape.

00:36:49,703 --> 00:36:51,638
And I refuse
to stand back and do nothing.

00:36:51,638 --> 00:36:53,340
And I refuse to stand by
and do nothing.

00:36:57,177 --> 00:37:00,213
Susan, you can do this.

00:37:00,213 --> 00:37:02,749
The difference between
a victim and victory

00:37:02,749 --> 00:37:03,750
is action.

00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:06,152
Take back your life.

00:37:06,152 --> 00:37:09,089
Provoke him,
expose him for what he is.

00:37:10,657 --> 00:37:12,425
You see this?

00:37:12,425 --> 00:37:15,328
This is what he turned me into.

00:37:15,328 --> 00:37:17,797
A whore, a prostitute.

00:37:17,797 --> 00:37:19,399
He's selling my body

00:37:19,399 --> 00:37:21,001
to thousands of men

00:37:21,001 --> 00:37:23,303
around the world 24/7.

00:37:23,303 --> 00:37:25,839
As of today,
I'm shutting you down.

00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:28,908
And so here's my message
to all you men out there.

00:37:28,908 --> 00:37:31,811
Log off and check
into your families.

00:37:31,811 --> 00:37:33,713
Don't let this coward win.

00:37:33,713 --> 00:37:34,948

00:37:34,948 --> 00:37:37,050

00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:38,718
RYAN:
Well done, Susan.

00:37:38,718 --> 00:37:40,020
CLIKK:
Agent Ryan, I've been tracking

00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:42,088
Nebula1's activity
on Friend Agenda

00:37:42,088 --> 00:37:44,357
since you announced
her press conference.

00:37:44,357 --> 00:37:48,294
In the last hour, he's peeped
her page 900,000 times.

00:37:48,294 --> 00:37:50,263
He D.O.S.'d her?

00:37:50,263 --> 00:37:52,632
He's so angry,
he crashed her site.

00:37:52,632 --> 00:37:55,402
You wanted obsession.
You got it.

00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:58,972
We're going to San Diego.

00:38:34,908 --> 00:38:36,042

You're a sadist.

Where's Kitty?

00:38:42,749 --> 00:38:44,217
You mean Susan?

00:38:44,217 --> 00:38:46,152
You're confused.

00:38:46,152 --> 00:38:49,122
Susan is real; Kitty is not.

00:38:49,122 --> 00:38:51,124
I created Kitty.

00:38:51,124 --> 00:38:53,126
I made her.

00:38:53,126 --> 00:38:55,862
I'm not gonna ask you again.

00:38:59,799 --> 00:39:01,801
Is that a .45?

00:39:03,903 --> 00:39:06,005

00:39:06,005 --> 00:39:08,274
I guarantee you
it's never been fired.

00:39:10,076 --> 00:39:13,780
I've had bigger guns pointed
at my face.

00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:16,216
Wait till you see my other gun.

00:39:16,216 --> 00:39:17,884
I saw it.

00:39:17,884 --> 00:39:20,386
The one your hit man used
to kill Audrey Berman?

00:39:20,386 --> 00:39:23,123
I thought
I'd do this one myself.

00:39:23,123 --> 00:39:25,758
I thought you'd be
more of a blade man.

00:39:35,702 --> 00:39:37,770
She just got him to trade down.

00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:39,873
How long are we gonna play
this waiting game?

00:39:39,873 --> 00:39:41,941
We wait for
Agent Ryan's code word.

00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:50,717
You going to cut me?

00:40:00,226 --> 00:40:02,128
You like to watch me bleed?

00:40:04,063 --> 00:40:05,064
Yeah.

00:40:06,633 --> 00:40:08,201
You want me to cut you again?

00:40:08,201 --> 00:40:09,869
Are you hearing that?

00:40:09,869 --> 00:40:12,639
Yeah. She's adding
years to his sentence.

00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:14,908
Tell me about the first time.

00:40:14,908 --> 00:40:18,344
I was eight years old...

00:40:18,344 --> 00:40:20,713
and I cut my sister's breasts

00:40:20,713 --> 00:40:22,715
with a straight razor.

00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:26,019
I got no problem
cutting you.

00:40:28,688 --> 00:40:30,790
Well, I do.

00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:31,824
I'm out of here.

Drop it! Drop it!

00:40:55,114 --> 00:40:57,050
Stay down!

00:40:57,050 --> 00:40:59,185
Stay down!
You're under arrest

00:40:59,185 --> 00:41:01,821
for attempted murder
of a federal agent,

00:41:01,821 --> 00:41:03,223
conspiracy to commit murder,

00:41:10,697 --> 00:41:11,965
You all right?

00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:16,869
I'll feel a lot better when you
get our hit man behind bars.

00:41:16,869 --> 00:41:18,037
You're something else.

00:41:18,037 --> 00:41:19,239

Oh, my God.

SUSAN:
Thank you so much for
bringing us down here.

00:41:25,845 --> 00:41:27,180
The girls are
so excited.

Daddy! Daddy!

00:41:39,759 --> 00:41:41,761
You brought my husband home?

00:41:41,761 --> 00:41:43,329
After all you've been through,
you both deserve

00:41:43,329 --> 00:41:45,131
a hero's welcome.

00:41:47,333 --> 00:41:48,935

That was nice.

00:41:56,809 --> 00:41:59,812
So this is good-bye,
I guess, huh?

00:41:59,812 --> 00:42:01,948
Well, for now.

00:42:01,948 --> 00:42:03,349
Where you off to?

00:42:03,349 --> 00:42:05,051
Oh, bank robbery, Pittsburgh.

00:42:05,051 --> 00:42:07,820
How much?
Three cents.

00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:09,856
Oh, give me a break.
Talk to me. How much?

$2.4 million a week.

00:42:15,028 --> 00:42:16,896
Makes for one hell of a heist.

00:42:16,896 --> 00:42:18,665
Check your bank statements.
No kidding.

And they say there's no
such thing as the perfect crime.

00:42:21,134 --> 00:42:23,703
It's not the perfect crime.

00:42:23,703 --> 00:42:26,072
It's cyber crime.
