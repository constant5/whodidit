RUSSELL:
<i>Previously on</i> CSI:

00:00:02,737 --> 00:00:04,405
<i>Our serial killer</i>
<i>got all of his inspiration</i>

00:00:04,405 --> 00:00:05,907
<i>from one place:</i>
<i>the Nine Circles of Hell.</i>

00:00:05,907 --> 00:00:06,975
<i>Your daughter, Ellie,</i>

00:00:06,975 --> 00:00:08,443
who may be missing.

00:00:08,443 --> 00:00:09,911
LARSON:
<i>The pictures I sent online?</i>

00:00:09,911 --> 00:00:11,913
<i>A client who reached out</i>
<i>to my ministry.</i>

00:00:11,913 --> 00:00:14,048
Oliver Tate.
Works for a biotech company.

00:00:14,048 --> 00:00:15,717
BRODY:
<i>Without an undercover</i>
<i>operation,</i>

00:00:15,717 --> 00:00:17,151
<i>we are all just sitting around</i>

00:00:17,151 --> 00:00:19,053
<i>waiting for</i>
<i>another body to drop.</i>

00:00:19,053 --> 00:00:20,421
I need to do this, Dad.

00:00:20,421 --> 00:00:21,823
RUSSELL:
<i>Stop the SUV.</i>

00:00:21,823 --> 00:00:23,758
<i>Killer's got Morgan.</i>
<i>And Ellie.</i>

00:00:23,758 --> 00:00:24,893
He's got them both.

00:00:27,829 --> 00:00:29,931
PRIEST:
The Book of Job tells the story

00:00:29,931 --> 00:00:32,667
of a man who loved God

00:00:32,667 --> 00:00:36,437
and renounced evil.

00:00:36,437 --> 00:00:40,375
Until one day,
Satan posed a challenge to God.

00:00:41,809 --> 00:00:43,945
Test this man.

00:00:43,945 --> 00:00:46,114
Test his faith.

00:00:46,114 --> 00:00:49,651
When we mourn,

00:00:49,651 --> 00:00:52,153
we're all tempted to curse God.

00:00:52,153 --> 00:00:56,457
To give voice to our anger,
our confusion.

00:00:56,457 --> 00:00:59,827
Our sense of powerlessness
against evil.

00:00:59,827 --> 00:01:02,697
<i>We're tempted to ask:</i>

00:01:02,697 --> 00:01:07,168
<i>Are we being punished</i>
<i>for our own sins?</i>

00:01:07,168 --> 00:01:10,004
<i>We're tempted to ask:</i>

00:01:10,004 --> 00:01:13,908
<i>Is there something</i>
<i>we could have done?</i>

00:01:13,908 --> 00:01:16,444
TATE:
You are the angry girl.

00:01:20,949 --> 00:01:22,817
(siren whoops)

00:01:24,085 --> 00:01:26,487
Get out of the car!
Now!
Get out!

00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:31,826
Nick! She's not here.
Russell, Morgan's gone.

00:01:31,826 --> 00:01:32,961
(sighs)

00:01:32,961 --> 00:01:36,464
Oliver Tate, LVPD!

00:01:36,464 --> 00:01:37,565
Go, go!

00:01:37,565 --> 00:01:39,434
Go left!

00:01:39,434 --> 00:01:40,802
Yep. Clear.
Clear!

00:01:40,802 --> 00:01:41,903
Sheriff, it's clear.

00:01:41,903 --> 00:01:44,505
No sign of...
Find Tate.

00:01:44,505 --> 00:01:46,007
RUSSELL:
<i>Nick, traffic cams</i>
<i>showed two SUVs.</i>

00:01:46,007 --> 00:01:47,609
<i>We're tracking</i>
<i>the other one now.</i>

00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:50,645
I got it.

00:01:50,645 --> 00:01:51,980
RUSSELL:
The SUV with Morgan

00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,414
is parked outside
a storage facility

00:01:53,414 --> 00:01:54,682
off of Hill

00:01:54,682 --> 00:01:56,618
<i>and Decatur.</i>

00:02:17,538 --> 00:02:19,440
Greg.

Greg!

00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:23,411
Drop back!

00:02:32,587 --> 00:02:34,522
Greg?

00:02:51,606 --> 00:02:53,941

STOKES (on radio):
Stand by, Russell.

00:03:52,786 --> 00:03:54,588
SANDERS:
It's not Morgan.
It sure looks like her, though.

00:03:54,588 --> 00:03:56,490
Her hair, her dress.

00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:58,358
STOKES:
I think it's one of
the missing girls

00:03:58,358 --> 00:03:59,359
from Larson's church.

00:03:59,359 --> 00:04:01,194
The crime scene's

00:04:01,194 --> 00:04:04,631
staged like the
Fifth Circle of Hell.

00:04:04,631 --> 00:04:07,134
We'll start to process.
Uh, get us some help

00:04:07,134 --> 00:04:08,168
out here, will you?

00:04:08,168 --> 00:04:09,202
If I may conjecture...

00:04:09,202 --> 00:04:10,237
RUSSELL:
John, not now.

00:04:10,237 --> 00:04:11,405
Your press badge only gets you

00:04:11,405 --> 00:04:12,773
so much access.
No, I understand.

00:04:12,773 --> 00:04:14,641
This has nothing to do
with my being a reporter

00:04:14,641 --> 00:04:16,476
doing some story
right now.

00:04:16,476 --> 00:04:18,578
If neither Ellie Brass
nor CSI Brody

00:04:18,578 --> 00:04:20,080
were intended to be

00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,449
the killer's next
victim, then...

00:04:22,449 --> 00:04:24,618
then there is still
hope, isn't there?

00:04:24,618 --> 00:04:27,554
There are four circles
of Hell left,

00:04:27,554 --> 00:04:30,390
so... more circles
means more time.

00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:31,658
We are gonna find them.

00:04:31,658 --> 00:04:33,160
Alive?

00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,028
Or like all the others?

00:04:35,028 --> 00:04:37,230
ECKLIE:
We know you're working
with Oliver Tate.

00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:39,232
Oliver Tate.
(chuckles)

00:04:39,232 --> 00:04:40,567
No way.

00:04:40,567 --> 00:04:42,102
Where are the girls?

00:04:42,102 --> 00:04:44,171
I already told your
guys who stopped me.

00:04:44,171 --> 00:04:46,373
Now I'm telling you--
I don't know.

00:04:46,373 --> 00:04:48,074
ECKLIE:
And we're telling you
we don't buy it.

00:04:48,074 --> 00:04:50,343
Two SUVs, two drivers--
you playing decoy,

00:04:50,343 --> 00:04:52,212
and whoever was
driving the girl.

00:04:52,212 --> 00:04:53,447
And not just any girl.

00:04:53,447 --> 00:04:55,081
I know your daughter Ellie

00:04:55,081 --> 00:04:56,583
from Brother Larson's church.

00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:59,519
She told me all about you.

00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,654
(whispers):
I'm not your little girl.

00:05:02,322 --> 00:05:04,090
You're gonna talk to us.

00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,725
Kiss my ass.

00:05:05,725 --> 00:05:07,727
BRASS: All right,
all right, no, no, no, no.

00:05:07,727 --> 00:05:11,064
ECKLIE:
The kid knows
where Morgan is, Jim.

00:05:11,064 --> 00:05:14,067
You want to know why
I was driving that SUV?

00:05:14,067 --> 00:05:16,436
I work for Brother Larson.

00:05:16,436 --> 00:05:18,371
Talk to him.

00:05:18,371 --> 00:05:20,340
You set us up,
you son of a bitch.

00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,409
I don't know what kind of...

00:05:22,409 --> 00:05:25,345
intimidation
Jake was subjected to,

00:05:25,345 --> 00:05:27,347
but I know the boy's
flesh is weak.

00:05:27,347 --> 00:05:30,484
Righteousness and a good lawyer,
cast out that confession

00:05:30,484 --> 00:05:33,687
faster than Jesus cast out the
moneychangers from the temple.

00:05:33,687 --> 00:05:35,322
I--I don't way what
game you're...

00:05:35,322 --> 00:05:36,523
you think you're
playing here.

00:05:36,523 --> 00:05:38,792
You--you and Tate
are on the hook

00:05:38,792 --> 00:05:41,127
for four murders, and
now two kidnappings.

00:05:41,127 --> 00:05:43,096
I'm being set up, pal.

00:05:43,096 --> 00:05:45,432
I'm telling you,
Oliver Tate is setting me up.

00:05:45,432 --> 00:05:47,300
Why would Tate go after you?

00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,669
Obviously, a man of Tate's...

00:05:49,669 --> 00:05:52,305
dark desires is vulnerable.

00:05:52,305 --> 00:05:55,041
I tried
to blackmail him, but...

00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:57,577
man wouldn't pay
my price, so...

00:05:57,577 --> 00:05:59,579
I called his bluff.

00:05:59,579 --> 00:06:02,616
I shared his secrets
with his...

00:06:02,616 --> 00:06:04,618
friends, his employer.

00:06:04,618 --> 00:06:05,785
(chuckles softly)

00:06:05,785 --> 00:06:08,688
Much to his chagrin,
I imagine.

00:06:08,688 --> 00:06:10,457
You don't believe me, do you?

00:06:10,457 --> 00:06:13,360
No.
Admittedly, I've
not earned your faith.

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,130
But... I know someone who has.

00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:19,165
Someone who was once

00:06:19,165 --> 00:06:21,768
Tate's favorite forbidden fruit.

00:06:21,768 --> 00:06:24,104
Someone who once
saved your life.

00:06:24,104 --> 00:06:25,138
Angela?

00:06:25,138 --> 00:06:26,540
The very same.

00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,575
I should warn you, Mr. Russell,

00:06:28,575 --> 00:06:31,511
if Oliver Tate is
the master of this game,

00:06:31,511 --> 00:06:34,814
he will never stop
until he sees to it...

00:06:34,814 --> 00:06:36,750
we all burn.

00:06:38,218 --> 00:06:39,619
ELLIE:
Can you hear me?

00:06:39,619 --> 00:06:41,087
Are you okay?

00:06:41,087 --> 00:06:43,290
Can you hear me?

00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:46,326
Are you okay?

00:06:46,326 --> 00:06:48,428
Can you hear me?

00:06:50,163 --> 00:06:52,198
Ellie?

00:06:52,198 --> 00:06:54,301
You're the cop.
He said you'd be coming.

00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,407
Who? Who said that?

00:07:00,407 --> 00:07:03,076
I don't know.
I haven't seen his face.

00:07:03,076 --> 00:07:04,377
All I know
is that I was with him

00:07:04,377 --> 00:07:05,712
at his condo,
and then I woke up here.

00:07:05,712 --> 00:07:07,681
You were
with him, too?

00:07:07,681 --> 00:07:09,616
Yeah.

00:07:11,051 --> 00:07:12,652
Where are we?

00:07:12,652 --> 00:07:14,521
What is this place?

00:07:14,521 --> 00:07:16,723
It's hell.

00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:27,801
ROBBINS:
Hyoid bone's broken.

00:07:27,801 --> 00:07:29,336
Denise Tyler was strangled.

00:07:31,404 --> 00:07:34,507
Thoracic injuries
appear postmortem

00:07:34,507 --> 00:07:37,077
from being impaled
on that spear.
Staged.

00:07:37,077 --> 00:07:38,511
Just like the others.

00:07:38,511 --> 00:07:40,747
We've seen this
latent bruising before.

00:07:40,747 --> 00:07:42,182
Our last victim.

00:07:42,182 --> 00:07:44,317
(beep)

00:07:44,317 --> 00:07:45,752
"Barb...

00:07:45,752 --> 00:07:47,420
"the...

00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,755
thorns."

00:07:48,755 --> 00:07:50,357
What does that mean?

00:07:50,357 --> 00:07:52,459
I don't know.

00:07:52,459 --> 00:07:53,593
This guy's dropping bodies,

00:07:53,593 --> 00:07:55,528
he's staging crime scenes

00:07:55,528 --> 00:07:59,065
and leaving nothing behind
to tie him to the murders.

00:07:59,065 --> 00:08:01,201
ROBBINS:
Maybe this time he did.
This looks like

00:08:01,201 --> 00:08:02,402
a dried secretion.

00:08:04,237 --> 00:08:05,739
<i>Perhaps a bead of sweat</i>

00:08:05,739 --> 00:08:07,807
<i>from the attack.</i>

00:08:07,807 --> 00:08:10,477
PHILLIPS:
<i>Could be our killer's DNA.</i>

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,082
Who's the mannequin
supposed to be,

00:08:16,082 --> 00:08:17,117
the Grim Reaper or something?

00:08:17,117 --> 00:08:19,252
Phlegyas, the boatman.

00:08:19,252 --> 00:08:22,255
In Dante's <i>Inferno,</i>
Virgil escorts Dante

00:08:22,255 --> 00:08:24,257
down through
the Nine Circles of Hell,

00:08:24,257 --> 00:08:26,326
and Phlegyas here
is the one who

00:08:26,326 --> 00:08:28,662
gets him across the River Styx,
the River of Death.

00:08:29,763 --> 00:08:31,364
I always liked engineering.

00:08:31,364 --> 00:08:34,334
How wide
do you think that door is?

00:08:34,334 --> 00:08:35,769
I don't know,
maybe four feet.

00:08:35,769 --> 00:08:37,537
And the beam
of this boat?

00:08:37,537 --> 00:08:39,305
At least six.

00:08:39,305 --> 00:08:41,808
Somebody put this thing
together in here.

00:08:41,808 --> 00:08:44,344
Let's see if we can take
it apart real quick.

00:08:44,344 --> 00:08:46,212
I think there's a
seam right here.

00:08:48,181 --> 00:08:50,316
Ready?
Yeah.

00:08:56,489 --> 00:08:59,392
Balliol's bones--
just like the ones our guy's

00:08:59,392 --> 00:09:01,795
been leaving behind for us
in the Bibles.

00:09:01,795 --> 00:09:04,330
STOKES:
Yeah, but those dowels

00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:07,367
had zeros on them;
these have zeros

00:09:07,367 --> 00:09:09,803
and numbers in repeating order

00:09:09,803 --> 00:09:11,204
from stem to stern.

00:09:11,204 --> 00:09:12,405
Maybe it's some kind

00:09:12,405 --> 00:09:14,441
of, uh, sequence, like a code.

00:09:18,111 --> 00:09:20,313
RUSSELL:
<i>Tate's leaving us messages.</i>

00:09:20,313 --> 00:09:22,682
He must've left us something
somewhere in that condo.

00:09:22,682 --> 00:09:24,718
I mean, he know we were
gonna tear the place apart.

00:09:24,718 --> 00:09:26,486
I'm telling you,
I haven't found anything,

00:09:26,486 --> 00:09:28,088
and I mean anything.

00:09:28,088 --> 00:09:29,456
There is no blood,

00:09:29,456 --> 00:09:31,224
there are no signs of violence.

00:09:31,224 --> 00:09:33,093
There is nothing here
to even suggest

00:09:33,093 --> 00:09:34,094
a secondary location.

00:09:34,094 --> 00:09:35,729
All right. Keep looking.

00:09:35,729 --> 00:09:38,631
You know, there's got to be
a message there someplace.

00:09:38,631 --> 00:09:40,266
Hi.
Hi.

00:09:40,266 --> 00:09:42,502
Did you find any trace
from the crime scene?

00:09:42,502 --> 00:09:44,204
Boat, SUV, dowel?

00:09:44,204 --> 00:09:47,173
I did find trace on the spear
and the planks of the dory.

00:09:47,173 --> 00:09:48,575
Halide deposits.

00:09:48,575 --> 00:09:50,076
That's rock salt, right?

00:09:50,076 --> 00:09:52,312
We're 300 miles
from the nearest ocean,

00:09:52,312 --> 00:09:53,513
but there are any number

00:09:53,513 --> 00:09:55,515
of mineral deposits
in southern Nevada.

00:09:55,515 --> 00:09:57,350
Doesn't exactly narrow
it down, does it?
No, it doesn't.

00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:00,353
She's a CSI.

00:10:00,353 --> 00:10:02,455
What the hell
was she doing undercover?

00:10:02,455 --> 00:10:04,691
Call me if you find
anything, David.

00:10:04,691 --> 00:10:07,427
Doc said he may have found
some DNA from the killer

00:10:07,427 --> 00:10:09,129
on Denise Tyler's body.

00:10:09,129 --> 00:10:11,431
Is that right?
Yeah, I've got
a dried secretion.

00:10:11,431 --> 00:10:13,266
I ran it--there seems
to be a problem.

00:10:13,266 --> 00:10:16,603
The profile seems incomplete;
there's no amelogenin.

00:10:16,603 --> 00:10:18,204
RUSSELL:
No sex gene?

00:10:18,204 --> 00:10:20,206
How is that even possible?

00:10:20,206 --> 00:10:22,242
You know, run it again,
and get Greg to help you.

00:10:27,213 --> 00:10:28,815
(sighs)

00:10:35,688 --> 00:10:37,524
Hey.
Hey.

00:10:37,524 --> 00:10:39,692
When did you get back
from San Francisco?

00:10:39,692 --> 00:10:41,761
A few hours ago.
You were in PD.

00:10:41,761 --> 00:10:43,630
Uh, Ecklie asked me
to check on Larson's story.

00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:47,634
According to police records,
Angela, aka Miss Kitty,

00:10:47,634 --> 00:10:50,270
was arrested last year
for solicitation.

00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:52,572
Vice made a notation that she
was with an Oliver Tate.

00:10:52,572 --> 00:10:55,508
Cops busted her;
they let Tate go.

00:10:55,508 --> 00:10:58,211
So Larson's telling the truth
about Tate knowing Angela.

00:10:58,211 --> 00:11:00,346
And maybe the blackmail.
I spoke to his

00:11:00,346 --> 00:11:03,116
old boss at PhiloDyne, the
biotech company where he worked.

00:11:03,116 --> 00:11:05,118
Tate was fired
for personal indiscretion.

00:11:05,118 --> 00:11:06,686
After that,
he was angry

00:11:06,686 --> 00:11:09,556
at the company, he was angry
at the cops, at the world.

00:11:09,556 --> 00:11:11,024
He became a recluse.

00:11:11,024 --> 00:11:12,559
We need to talk to Angela.

00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:15,428
She's disappeared.

00:12:36,676 --> 00:12:39,045
Officer downstairs let me up.

00:12:40,713 --> 00:12:42,682
You don't want
to shoot the messenger.

00:12:45,118 --> 00:12:46,653
Someone left their Bible
and a dowel

00:12:46,653 --> 00:12:48,788
outside my hotel door
with that inside.

00:12:48,788 --> 00:12:50,690

Quote from Dante's <i>Inferno.</i>

00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:58,665
Inscribed on the Gates of Hell.

00:13:07,273 --> 00:13:10,610
The King said,
"Bring me a sword.

00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:12,779
"Divide the child in two.

00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:14,247
"Give half to one

00:13:14,247 --> 00:13:15,682
and half to the other."

00:13:15,682 --> 00:13:21,554
By this wisdom...
Solomon discerned

the worthiness of the one that
would lay claim to the child.

You can only have
one daughter back.

00:13:29,562 --> 00:13:31,130
You have a decision to make.

00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:33,666
Or the decision
will be made for you.

00:13:36,469 --> 00:13:38,438
You have six hours.

00:13:44,143 --> 00:13:46,279
You can only have
one daughter back.

Yeah.

00:13:58,358 --> 00:14:00,493
What I don't understand
is why Tate

00:14:00,493 --> 00:14:01,761
is now sending messages

00:14:01,761 --> 00:14:03,629
through you.
Is there anything

00:14:03,629 --> 00:14:04,764
you want to tell us?

00:14:06,466 --> 00:14:08,134

He's screwing with us.
He's using my daughter to do it.

00:14:13,573 --> 00:14:16,242
He doesn't even say
how we're supposed

00:14:16,242 --> 00:14:18,578
to communicate with him.
FINLAY: My guess is
we're gonna get

00:14:18,578 --> 00:14:20,146
another flash drive.

00:14:20,146 --> 00:14:22,382
Well, when you do,
why not give Tate

00:14:22,382 --> 00:14:24,584
an answer?
Excuse me?

00:14:24,584 --> 00:14:26,285
It is the last
thing he'd expect.

00:14:26,285 --> 00:14:27,387
Maybe throw him off his game.

00:14:27,387 --> 00:14:28,755
No, this isn't a game.

00:14:28,755 --> 00:14:30,723
And as I recall, the
last time you were here,

00:14:30,723 --> 00:14:32,658
you two convinced me
to send my daughter

00:14:32,658 --> 00:14:34,093
into the arms
of a killer.

00:14:34,093 --> 00:14:36,195
I don't think that's quite fair.

00:14:36,195 --> 00:14:38,297
No, no. You're right.

00:14:38,297 --> 00:14:40,066
'Cause I'm the one
who made that call.

00:14:40,066 --> 00:14:42,035
But you two don't have
to live with it.

I know you said

00:14:43,469 --> 00:14:44,771

Here, watch this.

She keeps looking up.

Why is she doing that?

Well, she's struggling,
she's under duress.

00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:08,528
No, she's stronger
than that.

00:15:08,528 --> 00:15:10,263
And she's smart.

00:15:10,263 --> 00:15:12,098
Like you.

00:15:12,098 --> 00:15:13,733
Why would you be looking up?

00:15:13,733 --> 00:15:16,302
I would look up
to send a message.

NANCY:
Did you see
Ellie on the video?

00:15:20,773 --> 00:15:22,408
No, just Morgan,
but we have to believe

00:15:22,408 --> 00:15:24,310
that Ellie's still alive.

00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,248
If you had to choose...

00:15:29,248 --> 00:15:30,650
We don't have to choose.
There's no choosing.

00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:31,651
This isn't real, Nancy.

00:15:31,651 --> 00:15:32,752
I know. I'm just saying.

00:15:32,752 --> 00:15:35,221
Ellie is my daughter.

00:15:35,221 --> 00:15:36,489
She's my little girl.

00:15:36,489 --> 00:15:39,759
But she's not
a little girl.

00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,694
She's--she's not...

00:15:41,694 --> 00:15:44,063
six years old.
(sighs)

00:15:44,063 --> 00:15:47,467
Look, I understand.

00:15:47,467 --> 00:15:51,304
The first six years
we were all together,

00:15:51,304 --> 00:15:53,206
you were a great father.

00:15:53,206 --> 00:15:55,141
You were a great husband.
You were a better man.

00:15:55,141 --> 00:15:56,209
Until I screwed it up.

00:15:56,209 --> 00:15:57,710
We screwed it up.

00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:00,680
So what chance
did Ellie have

00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,715
but to do the same thing?

00:16:02,715 --> 00:16:04,317
Gun to your head,

00:16:04,317 --> 00:16:06,285
you'd choose
the other girl, right?

00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,256
If we get her back,

00:16:10,256 --> 00:16:13,426
you have to love her
not for who she was

00:16:13,426 --> 00:16:15,261
but for who she is.

00:16:21,467 --> 00:16:24,470
All this time, all these years,
I've been searching for Ellie

00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:26,606
when she didn't
want to be found.

00:16:27,673 --> 00:16:29,809
I thought, by my sacrifice,

00:16:29,809 --> 00:16:32,512
I could prove to myself
that I still loved her.

00:16:32,512 --> 00:16:35,348
But you're right.

00:16:35,348 --> 00:16:38,384
I'd choose the other girl.

00:16:38,384 --> 00:16:39,719
STOKES:
You know, maybe she's trying

00:16:39,719 --> 00:16:41,687
to draw our attention
to something else

00:16:41,687 --> 00:16:43,623
in the room.
You know, that's what
I thought at first.

00:16:43,623 --> 00:16:44,624
But check this out.

00:16:44,624 --> 00:16:46,492
Every single time

00:16:46,492 --> 00:16:49,529
Morgan looks up, there's
a spike on the audio track.

00:16:49,529 --> 00:16:51,731
BRODY:
You have six hours.
Maybe if I can isolate it.

(beep, low rumbling)

00:17:00,373 --> 00:17:02,041
Low frequency.

00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:03,176
Power lines?

00:17:03,176 --> 00:17:05,745
Yeah, but it surges.
Then it dissipates.

00:17:05,745 --> 00:17:08,047
(rumbling continues)

00:17:08,047 --> 00:17:09,048
Doppler effect.

00:17:09,048 --> 00:17:10,149
It's moving.

00:17:10,149 --> 00:17:11,484
Could be an engine.

00:17:11,484 --> 00:17:13,352
NICK:
It sounds like a jet.

00:17:13,352 --> 00:17:15,221
And it's close
to the ground.

00:17:15,221 --> 00:17:17,523
Taking off or landing?

00:17:17,523 --> 00:17:19,759
If we can I.D.
this audio,

00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:22,094
we might be able
to I.D. the plane.

00:17:22,094 --> 00:17:24,664
There are several airports
around the Vegas area,

00:17:24,664 --> 00:17:26,232
including Nellis
Air Force Base.

00:17:26,232 --> 00:17:28,301
Yeah, and if we run it
against FAA flight logs

00:17:28,301 --> 00:17:30,803
from the time of the recording,
we could have our flight path.

00:17:30,803 --> 00:17:32,772
And we can narrow down
the search area.

00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,708
I processed the dowels
in the boat.

00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:37,210
They were clean,
just like the ones

00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:39,045
that you guys have been
finding in the Bibles.

00:17:39,045 --> 00:17:41,280
If that's a sequence, I'm
not sure where to begin.

00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,515
It's ternary code.

00:17:42,515 --> 00:17:43,783
Like binary code
but instead of just having

00:17:43,783 --> 00:17:45,818
zeros and ones,
you have zeros, ones

00:17:45,818 --> 00:17:48,287
and twos.
You're talking
about digital encryption?

00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,589
I'm also talking about DNA.

00:17:49,589 --> 00:17:50,656
In this case.

00:17:50,656 --> 00:17:52,425
Finn found this

00:17:52,425 --> 00:17:53,693
in Tate's condo.

00:17:53,693 --> 00:17:57,063
Synthetic DNA
in saline solution.

00:17:57,063 --> 00:17:58,564
An exact match
to the DNA

00:17:58,564 --> 00:18:00,800
we thought was sweat
from our killer.

00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,668
Engineered for
data storage.

00:18:02,668 --> 00:18:04,704
That sounds
pretty sci-fi.

00:18:04,704 --> 00:18:07,573
But Tate did work
at a biotech company.

00:18:07,573 --> 00:18:10,776
Forget about flash drives--
this is the future.

00:18:10,776 --> 00:18:12,511
So let's say that we
wanted to store this

00:18:12,511 --> 00:18:15,414
digitally on
synthetic DNA. First,

00:18:15,414 --> 00:18:17,183
we would have to translate
the pixels

00:18:17,183 --> 00:18:19,051
<i>into the zeros, ones and twos</i>
<i>of ternary code.</i>

00:18:19,051 --> 00:18:20,753
<i>Then we'd transfer</i>
<i>those numbers</i>

00:18:20,753 --> 00:18:23,422
<i>into the nucleic acids of DNA.</i>

00:18:23,422 --> 00:18:25,191
<i>The information</i>
<i>can be retrieved</i>

00:18:25,191 --> 00:18:27,193
<i>as long as you have</i>
<i>the right decryption key.</i>

00:18:27,193 --> 00:18:29,195
<i>Tate must have been storing</i>
<i>something important,</i>

00:18:29,195 --> 00:18:31,397
something he wanted to protect.

00:18:31,397 --> 00:18:33,399
Well, if the dowels
are a decryption key,

00:18:33,399 --> 00:18:35,468
we should be able
to read it, right?

00:18:35,468 --> 00:18:37,503
We'd need the biometric scanners
from Tate's company.

00:18:37,503 --> 00:18:38,504
And a warrant.

00:18:38,504 --> 00:18:39,672
So let's get a warrant.

00:18:39,672 --> 00:18:42,675
(grunts softly)

00:18:42,675 --> 00:18:44,577
(quietly):
We shouldn't
be doing this.

00:18:44,577 --> 00:18:46,078
What if he hears us?

00:18:46,078 --> 00:18:49,181
Just keep listening.
I almost got this.

00:18:49,181 --> 00:18:50,349
(groans)

00:18:50,349 --> 00:18:51,617
It's not gonna
work anyway.

00:18:51,617 --> 00:18:53,519
We're not giving up.

00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:55,588
Just like the people who are
looking for us aren't giving up.

00:18:55,588 --> 00:18:57,189
Yeah, right.

00:18:57,189 --> 00:18:58,591
Keep on dreaming.
(sighs)

00:18:58,591 --> 00:19:00,159
Ellie, I know it seems

00:19:00,159 --> 00:19:02,261
like the world has turned
its back on you,

00:19:02,261 --> 00:19:03,562
but it's not the case.

00:19:03,562 --> 00:19:05,564
You don't know anything
about me.

00:19:08,801 --> 00:19:10,703
I know a lot more
than you think.

00:19:10,703 --> 00:19:13,439
I know how much
your dad cares about you.

00:19:13,439 --> 00:19:16,142
And how much he misses you
and how he would do anything

00:19:16,142 --> 00:19:18,277
to help you.
He's not doing this for me.

00:19:18,277 --> 00:19:20,279
You know that
he's not

00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:21,547
even my father?

00:19:21,547 --> 00:19:23,616
Yeah, my real dad
is some cop

00:19:23,616 --> 00:19:25,518
that my mom hooked
up with at the bar

00:19:25,518 --> 00:19:28,354
trying to get back at him
for all the bitches he banged.

00:19:28,354 --> 00:19:30,089
The only thing they
ever agreed upon

00:19:30,089 --> 00:19:32,491
was to lie to me about
it, but I found out.

00:19:32,491 --> 00:19:35,394
From some vice cop in Jersey

00:19:35,394 --> 00:19:38,331
who busted me
after he screwed me.

00:19:41,534 --> 00:19:43,302
(sighs)

00:19:43,302 --> 00:19:46,105
I used to hate my dad, too,
you know?
Please.

00:19:46,105 --> 00:19:48,474
Just spare me the speech about
how you let go of your past

00:19:48,474 --> 00:19:50,376
and learned to accept your dad
for who he was.

00:19:50,376 --> 00:19:52,578
All I'm saying
is I've seen your parents.

00:19:52,578 --> 00:19:54,513
It isn't what
you think it is.

00:19:54,513 --> 00:19:56,449
What are you talking
about, my parents?

00:19:56,449 --> 00:19:59,118
Your mom's here.

00:19:59,118 --> 00:20:00,586
My mom?

00:20:00,586 --> 00:20:02,254
Your dad called her.

00:20:02,254 --> 00:20:05,024
They may disagree
about most everything, but...

00:20:05,024 --> 00:20:07,493
they both love you.

00:20:07,493 --> 00:20:09,362
Well, it doesn't matter
because there's no way

00:20:09,362 --> 00:20:11,063
we're gonna make it
out of here alive.

00:20:17,536 --> 00:20:19,805
(beeping)

00:20:19,805 --> 00:20:21,741
(phone chimes)

00:20:23,376 --> 00:20:24,510
Russell.

00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:26,379
It's me. Angela.

00:20:26,379 --> 00:20:28,080
Angela, where have you been?
We've been looking for you.

00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,382
There's something
I should have told you

00:20:29,382 --> 00:20:32,284
about these murders,
about Oliver Tate.

00:20:32,284 --> 00:20:34,220
I'm scared, Mr. Russell.

00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,621
Tell me where you are right now.

00:20:35,621 --> 00:20:38,023
At the Fellowship.

00:20:38,023 --> 00:20:39,492
All right, Angela,

00:20:39,492 --> 00:20:41,594
I'm gonna send a team over
to you right now.

00:20:41,594 --> 00:20:43,496
No. No, please, Mr. Russell.

00:20:43,496 --> 00:20:46,198
I don't trust anyone but you.

00:20:47,266 --> 00:20:50,102
(sighs)
All right.

00:20:50,102 --> 00:20:52,705
All right, okay, I'm on my way.

00:20:56,509 --> 00:20:59,478
Angela?

00:21:24,236 --> 00:21:26,205
Oh...

00:21:28,641 --> 00:21:31,577
Put the phone down.

00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:38,417
Phone. On the floor.

00:21:38,417 --> 00:21:40,820
Now.

00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,188
Kick it over here.

00:21:49,562 --> 00:21:53,098
Whatever Angela
did to you, Tate,

00:21:53,098 --> 00:21:54,567
she did not deserve this.

00:21:54,567 --> 00:21:57,369
Easy for you to say.
She didn't betray you.

00:21:57,369 --> 00:21:59,572
What do you want? You want...
you want me to beg? Is that it?

00:21:59,572 --> 00:22:01,240
You want me to
choose which girl

00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,741
gets to live, you sick...

00:22:02,741 --> 00:22:06,178
You really have no idea what
is happening here, do you?

00:22:06,178 --> 00:22:08,614
Look, it's just... it's
just you and me right now.

00:22:08,614 --> 00:22:10,649
Tell--tell me
what it is you want,

00:22:10,649 --> 00:22:12,117
and I... and I'll
get it for you.

00:22:12,117 --> 00:22:13,252
I just want the girls back.

00:22:13,252 --> 00:22:15,354
For a pair of whores,

00:22:15,354 --> 00:22:17,356
you would cast your own soul
into the fire?

00:22:17,356 --> 00:22:19,692
I would make a deal
with the devil himself

00:22:19,692 --> 00:22:21,760
to get those girls back.

00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,463
Whatever you think of me,
I am not the devil.

00:22:24,463 --> 00:22:26,732
However, I do believe

00:22:26,732 --> 00:22:30,636
the devil is within your midst.

00:22:30,636 --> 00:22:33,072
Are you talking about Larson?

00:22:33,072 --> 00:22:34,773
That's kind of funny,
'cause he said

00:22:34,773 --> 00:22:36,408
the same thing about you.

00:22:36,408 --> 00:22:38,711
Except he's been in
custody for two days.

00:22:38,711 --> 00:22:41,247
Kind of hard to kill somebody

00:22:41,247 --> 00:22:43,182
when you're behind
bars, isn't it?

00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:46,619
Oh, God.

00:22:46,619 --> 00:22:49,321
I see.

00:22:49,321 --> 00:22:51,757
Those girls are going to die,

00:22:51,757 --> 00:22:55,227
and I will be held accountable.

00:22:55,227 --> 00:22:57,229
You can't stop it.

00:22:57,229 --> 00:22:59,498
And neither can I.

00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:08,407
Control, this is
Charlie-Zero-One, Russell.

00:23:08,407 --> 00:23:10,609
I need backup at Fellowship
of the Fallen Angels.

00:23:10,609 --> 00:23:13,379
I'm in pursuit of Oliver Tate.

00:23:13,379 --> 00:23:15,447
Suspect's driving
a silver Taurus.

00:23:15,447 --> 00:23:18,150
Thomas-David-Henry,
Ocean-Three-Four-Seven.

00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:19,285
(Russell grunts)

00:23:24,356 --> 00:23:27,493
(glass clinking,
debris thudding and clinking)

00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:41,307
ECKLIE:
Oh, God. What the
hell is going on?

00:23:41,307 --> 00:23:42,541
I thought we
had our guy.

00:23:42,541 --> 00:23:43,709
BRASS:
Who says we didn't?

00:23:43,709 --> 00:23:45,678
All the signs
still point to Tate.

00:23:45,678 --> 00:23:48,280
They'll be picking up pieces
of him till tomorrow morning.

00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,416
I think we're looking
for an accomplice

00:23:50,416 --> 00:23:52,785
who decided to end
the partnership.

00:23:52,785 --> 00:23:54,520
I'm not so sure.

00:23:58,023 --> 00:24:00,025
Violence.

00:24:00,025 --> 00:24:01,393
ECKLIE:
What?

00:24:01,393 --> 00:24:03,329
Violence.

00:24:03,329 --> 00:24:06,265
The scattered remains look
exactly like the engraving.

00:24:06,265 --> 00:24:07,666
The Seventh Circle of Hell.

00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:10,269
I think that Tate
was just the next victim.

00:24:10,269 --> 00:24:11,503
ECKLIE:
Which means

00:24:11,503 --> 00:24:14,273
there are now
only two circles left.

00:24:14,273 --> 00:24:16,475
FINLAY:
I processed

00:24:16,475 --> 00:24:17,476
the Bible and the dowel.

00:24:17,476 --> 00:24:18,811
They're both clean.

00:24:18,811 --> 00:24:22,147
But there was a SIM card
inside the dowel and...

00:24:22,147 --> 00:24:24,316
a message... for you.

00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:31,056
The killer wants me
to make a call.

00:24:31,056 --> 00:24:33,158
We're set to run

00:24:33,158 --> 00:24:36,095
a cell tower trace,
for what it's worth.

00:24:38,697 --> 00:24:41,734
(line ringing)

00:24:41,734 --> 00:24:43,302
ELLIE:
Dad?

00:24:43,302 --> 00:24:44,703
Ellie.

00:24:44,703 --> 00:24:46,372
It's time.

00:24:46,372 --> 00:24:49,308
You have to give me your choice.

00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:53,345
Ellie...

00:24:55,381 --> 00:24:57,483
Sweetheart...

00:24:57,483 --> 00:25:00,786
I can't do that.

00:25:00,786 --> 00:25:02,721
I know.

00:25:10,095 --> 00:25:11,630
(phone beeps)

00:25:30,315 --> 00:25:31,617
JOHN:
I was told
I'd find you here.

00:25:31,617 --> 00:25:35,554
I assume this is where
you come for answers.

00:25:35,554 --> 00:25:38,090
Given your reputation,
it must work.

00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:39,725
Well, it's not working now.

00:25:44,063 --> 00:25:48,333
I know it took you 11 months
to find the Gig Harbor Killer...

00:25:48,333 --> 00:25:50,369
but you did find him.

00:25:50,369 --> 00:25:52,337
After he had already
killed six women.

00:25:52,337 --> 00:25:54,740
And here I am now
with seven dead,

00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:57,076
and I'm waiting for
another body to drop.

00:25:57,076 --> 00:25:59,311
Maybe a member
of my own team.

00:25:59,311 --> 00:26:03,048
Or at least the daughter of
someone very close to me, so...

00:26:09,088 --> 00:26:10,789
We're trained to
follow the evidence,

00:26:10,789 --> 00:26:12,725
but some--sometimes
that's not enough.

00:26:12,725 --> 00:26:15,561
There... there are times
when you need to hear that...

00:26:15,561 --> 00:26:20,065
that voice in your head
that says, "Look here."

00:26:22,134 --> 00:26:23,535
Trouble is, when you...

00:26:23,535 --> 00:26:26,171
when you've done this job
long enough...

00:26:26,171 --> 00:26:29,274
one day,
you stop hearing that voice.

00:26:29,274 --> 00:26:31,210
And that day has come?

00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:33,112
SIDLE:
Russell.

00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,682
Hey.

00:26:36,682 --> 00:26:38,150
You have anything?

00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:39,184
Two things.

00:26:39,184 --> 00:26:40,185
Doc found skin

00:26:40,185 --> 00:26:41,220
under Angela's nails.

00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,387
She got a piece of her attacker.

00:26:42,387 --> 00:26:43,622
Henry ran the DNA,
it came back

00:26:43,622 --> 00:26:46,592
unknown male,
so Tate is not our killer.

00:26:46,592 --> 00:26:49,561
Okay. What--what about
the synthetic DNA?

00:26:49,561 --> 00:26:51,764
I got the warrant.
I got Tate's company

00:26:51,764 --> 00:26:53,198
to decrypt the files.

00:26:53,198 --> 00:26:55,067
You need to see this.

00:26:55,067 --> 00:26:59,538
Tate's been using all his DNA
gigabytes for one thing--

00:26:59,538 --> 00:27:01,206
porn.

00:27:01,206 --> 00:27:03,509
Guy certainly had a fixation
on the Nine Circles of Hell.

00:27:03,509 --> 00:27:05,310
All of our female victims
are here.

00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:07,312
Yes, but he wasn't
killing them.

00:27:07,312 --> 00:27:09,314
It was sheer fantasy.

00:27:09,314 --> 00:27:10,616
Pretty clear, also,

00:27:10,616 --> 00:27:12,684
that Tate was a watcher,
not a participant.

00:27:12,684 --> 00:27:15,154
He was using teenage boys
as sexual surrogates.

00:27:15,154 --> 00:27:18,157
Some of them were pretty young.

00:27:18,157 --> 00:27:20,025
Our killer, whoever it is,

00:27:20,025 --> 00:27:23,729
left us evidence
of Tate's perversions, right?

00:27:23,729 --> 00:27:27,166
He's been talking
to us in puzzles, in--in code.

00:27:27,166 --> 00:27:30,202
Like the-the message...

00:27:30,202 --> 00:27:32,237
the message on the body.

00:27:35,174 --> 00:27:38,110
<i>"Barb... thee... thorns."</i>

00:27:41,613 --> 00:27:43,615
<i>It's an anagram.</i>

00:27:50,055 --> 00:27:51,523
That's from Dante's <i>Inferno.</i>

00:27:51,523 --> 00:27:55,260
"Who is in yon fire, that comes
so parted at the summit,

00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:57,362
"as it seem'd, ascending

00:27:57,362 --> 00:27:59,097
"from that funeral pile

00:27:59,097 --> 00:28:01,800
where lay the Theban brothers."

00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,569
"Barb... thee... thorns."

00:28:03,569 --> 00:28:05,270
Theban Brothers.

00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:06,738
Sons of Oedipus.

00:28:06,738 --> 00:28:09,808
Cursed for life because
of the sins of their father.

00:28:09,808 --> 00:28:12,311
See, I think we're looking
for brothers that Tate used.

00:28:12,311 --> 00:28:13,645
Hey, Henry!

00:28:13,645 --> 00:28:15,180
Come here.

00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:17,049
The skin you got
under Angela's nails--

00:28:17,049 --> 00:28:18,183
run it against Jake.

00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:29,494
Hey, D.B.
Hi.

00:28:29,494 --> 00:28:32,097
So it turns out your
hunch was right.

00:28:32,097 --> 00:28:33,732
DNA confirmed it.

00:28:33,732 --> 00:28:37,035
Angela's killer was a
familial match to Jake.

00:28:37,035 --> 00:28:40,105
Meet his brother--
Matthew Tarland.

00:28:40,105 --> 00:28:41,807
I pulled a print off
the trigger remote

00:28:41,807 --> 00:28:44,076
that was used in the
bomb to kill Tate.

00:28:44,076 --> 00:28:45,677
Got a hit in AFIS.

00:28:45,677 --> 00:28:47,779
It turns out that his
brother there, Matthew,

00:28:47,779 --> 00:28:50,349
was busted a couple of years ago
for solicitation.

00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:53,685
There's no way this
dude's gonna roll over

00:28:53,685 --> 00:28:55,153
on his own
flesh and blood.

00:28:55,153 --> 00:28:56,722
All we have him on right now

00:28:56,722 --> 00:28:59,358
is driving around the block,
and he knows it.

00:28:59,358 --> 00:29:00,626
I just... I just don't see

00:29:00,626 --> 00:29:03,028
he and his brother going
to all this trouble

00:29:03,028 --> 00:29:05,697
without wanting the world
to know what Tate did to them,

00:29:05,697 --> 00:29:08,400
why Tate had to be punished.

00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,269
Why we all had to be punished,
for that matter.

00:29:10,269 --> 00:29:11,803
Mm-hmm.

00:29:11,803 --> 00:29:15,641
No, he wants to confess.

00:29:15,641 --> 00:29:17,776
Just not to us.

00:29:17,776 --> 00:29:20,479
LARSON:
When they came to me,
I proclaimed your innocence.

00:29:20,479 --> 00:29:22,080
Even though you'd just planted

00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,449
a big, fat, red Judas smack
on my cheek,

00:29:24,449 --> 00:29:26,084
I said, "No.

00:29:26,084 --> 00:29:28,253
"He could never have committed
these heinous crimes

00:29:28,253 --> 00:29:33,225
"because only one man lives
in such dark places.

00:29:33,225 --> 00:29:34,559
Oliver Tate."

00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,428
Well, you would know.
You pimped to him.

00:29:36,428 --> 00:29:37,663
Yes, I did.

00:29:37,663 --> 00:29:40,499
Is that why
you bore false witness

00:29:40,499 --> 00:29:42,634
against me?

00:29:42,634 --> 00:29:44,136
I don't know
what you're talking about.

00:29:44,136 --> 00:29:45,570
Yeah, you do, Jake.

00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:49,207
You know what you've done--
you and your brother.

00:29:49,207 --> 00:29:50,609
It seems to me,

00:29:50,609 --> 00:29:54,713
your brother's kind of left you
holding the bag.

00:29:54,713 --> 00:29:57,616
And the Lord
said unto Cain,

00:29:57,616 --> 00:30:00,185
"Where is Abel thy brother?"

00:30:00,185 --> 00:30:01,586
And he said, "I know not.

00:30:03,555 --> 00:30:05,223
Am I my brother's keeper?"

00:30:05,223 --> 00:30:07,559
Am I my brother's keeper?

00:30:10,128 --> 00:30:12,064
A boy came to me once.

00:30:12,064 --> 00:30:13,699
A little boy.

00:30:13,699 --> 00:30:17,102
He'd been cast out onto
the street with his brother

00:30:17,102 --> 00:30:20,605
by a man who, father-like,
promised them everything...

00:30:20,605 --> 00:30:22,240
(panting)

00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,309
...but instead...

00:30:24,309 --> 00:30:26,511
used them.

00:30:26,511 --> 00:30:28,580
Twisted their souls.

00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:31,583
Do you remember that boy?

00:30:31,583 --> 00:30:34,119
Yes, I do.

00:30:34,119 --> 00:30:36,188
But he's... dead.
I think

00:30:36,188 --> 00:30:38,190
there is still love
in your heart.

00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:40,559
Not for me,

00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:43,128
but for someone...

00:30:43,128 --> 00:30:47,132
someone who gave that life
to you unconditionally,

00:30:47,132 --> 00:30:49,701
who's been repaid in blood.

00:30:53,105 --> 00:30:56,041
I think you need
to look at this.

00:30:57,809 --> 00:30:59,711
Recognize
your brother's work?

00:31:02,214 --> 00:31:03,749
You're lying.

00:31:03,749 --> 00:31:06,251
This is a trick.

00:31:06,251 --> 00:31:08,320
No, Matthew would never...

00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,223
He--he knows how much
I care about Angela. No.

00:31:11,223 --> 00:31:13,692
Jake, your brother killed her.

00:31:13,692 --> 00:31:16,428
He posed her just like
all the other girls.
No!

00:31:16,428 --> 00:31:18,196
You are your
brother's keeper.

00:31:18,196 --> 00:31:20,732
You are responsible
for what he's done

00:31:20,732 --> 00:31:23,101
and what he will do
to two more girls

00:31:23,101 --> 00:31:25,504
that have nothing to do
with what happened to you.

00:31:27,139 --> 00:31:29,474
We know he's in that area
right there.

00:31:29,474 --> 00:31:31,610
LARSON:
We are all sinners.

00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:34,246
We all need redemption.

00:31:34,246 --> 00:31:37,082
This is your chance.

00:31:43,255 --> 00:31:45,690
(footsteps, Ellie
whimpering and groaning)

00:31:55,233 --> 00:31:58,303
So what's the deal
with the mask anyway?

00:31:58,303 --> 00:32:00,472
Why are you so scared
to show your face?

00:32:02,207 --> 00:32:04,609
You're just going
to kill us.

00:32:04,609 --> 00:32:08,180
Or is that it?

00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:10,182
You don't have the guts

00:32:10,182 --> 00:32:12,250
to look us in the eye
when you do it.

00:32:16,521 --> 00:32:18,490
This what you wanted?

00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:20,292
Take a good look.
It's the last thing

00:32:20,292 --> 00:32:22,494
you're going to see.

00:32:22,494 --> 00:32:25,797
I'm going
to make you feel everything.

00:32:25,797 --> 00:32:27,132
(groaning)

00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:33,405
Lock him up.

00:32:38,076 --> 00:32:40,045
Wait.
What?

00:32:40,045 --> 00:32:41,379
I think there might be
another girl.

00:32:41,379 --> 00:32:42,714
What do you mean?

00:32:42,714 --> 00:32:44,783
When he had me on the phone,
I think I heard

00:32:44,783 --> 00:32:46,551
another girl.
Are you sure? Where?

00:32:46,551 --> 00:32:48,653
I don't know.
Maybe in another room.

00:32:50,755 --> 00:32:52,124
Run! I'll catch up.

00:32:54,025 --> 00:32:55,794
Hello?

00:32:57,095 --> 00:32:59,030
Anybody in here?

00:33:16,615 --> 00:33:19,251
(gun cocks)

00:33:19,251 --> 00:33:21,453
Come down here.

00:33:34,499 --> 00:33:37,068
Get down on your knees.

00:33:47,579 --> 00:33:51,082
Told you I was gonna
make you feel everything.

00:33:51,082 --> 00:33:52,150
(Brody grunts)
(groans)

00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:53,618
(grunts)

00:33:53,618 --> 00:33:55,787
(both grunting, blows landing)

00:33:57,556 --> 00:33:59,090
No!

00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:00,325
(gagging, grunting)

00:34:00,325 --> 00:34:02,527
Let her go.

00:34:04,329 --> 00:34:07,299
(Brody grunts, gasps)

00:34:12,204 --> 00:34:14,673
(low grunt)

00:34:14,673 --> 00:34:16,608
(body falls)

00:34:19,744 --> 00:34:22,214
(panting)

00:34:25,116 --> 00:34:27,219
Thank you
for coming back for me.

00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:29,688
Come on, let's
get out of here.

00:34:30,789 --> 00:34:32,557
(gunshot)

00:34:33,625 --> 00:34:35,560
(body thuds)

00:34:44,369 --> 00:34:46,571
(sirens wailing)

00:34:50,041 --> 00:34:52,077

♪ ♪

00:34:55,447 --> 00:34:57,182
What do you got?

00:34:57,182 --> 00:34:58,316
He's dead, Jim.

00:35:00,085 --> 00:35:01,553
BRASS:
Ellie.
ELLIE: Dad.

00:35:01,553 --> 00:35:04,389
He shot her. I tried to
get the gun from him,

00:35:04,389 --> 00:35:07,325
but I couldn't-- he was
too strong, and he...
It's okay. It's okay.

00:35:07,325 --> 00:35:09,094
Her pulse is weak,
but she's alive.

00:35:09,094 --> 00:35:11,096
Control, this is
Captain Brass.

00:35:11,096 --> 00:35:12,530
Officer down.

(siren wailing)

00:35:22,407 --> 00:35:25,377
Ellie said Morgan
got the girls out of there,

00:35:25,377 --> 00:35:27,512
but Matthew just...
chased 'em down,

00:35:27,512 --> 00:35:29,614
shot Morgan right in the back.

00:35:29,614 --> 00:35:31,383
STOKES:
Then he tackles her,

00:35:31,383 --> 00:35:34,419
there's a struggle,
the gun drops, she shoots him.

00:35:35,487 --> 00:35:37,222
What about Morgan?

00:35:37,222 --> 00:35:38,790
In surgery.

00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:42,093
Doctors say anything?
Nothing yet.

00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,201
Finished the trace reports.

00:35:50,201 --> 00:35:51,803
Morgan's in surgery,

00:35:51,803 --> 00:35:53,371
so I thought I'd...
Go.

00:35:53,371 --> 00:35:56,041
Thanks.

00:35:56,041 --> 00:35:57,575
It's a good thing the
kid was a bad shot.

00:35:57,575 --> 00:35:59,377
Ellie was lucky, too.

00:35:59,377 --> 00:36:02,514
You know, she only got off
the one round, the kill shot.

00:36:02,514 --> 00:36:04,149
I found, um...

00:36:04,149 --> 00:36:06,484
debris...
in the firing mechanism.

00:36:06,484 --> 00:36:09,054
Maybe from the struggle.

00:36:09,054 --> 00:36:11,156
Kid on top of her,
wrestling in the dirt.

00:36:11,156 --> 00:36:13,024
On top of her?

00:36:13,024 --> 00:36:14,693
Don't think so--
at least not

00:36:14,693 --> 00:36:16,194
when Ellie
fired the gun.

00:36:16,194 --> 00:36:17,696
There was no GSR
on his shirt.

00:36:17,696 --> 00:36:20,332
She had to be at least
four feet away from him.

00:36:22,067 --> 00:36:23,768
Traumatic event.

00:36:23,768 --> 00:36:26,438
People remember things
differently, I guess.

00:36:26,438 --> 00:36:27,739
Not that differently.

00:36:27,739 --> 00:36:28,773
Call me from the hospital, okay?

00:36:28,773 --> 00:36:30,608
With an update.

00:36:30,608 --> 00:36:34,279
Nick found Matthew Tarland's
cell phone at the scene, right?

00:36:34,279 --> 00:36:35,680
Yeah. I'm going over
his e-mails now.

00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,148
Okay, forget
the e-mails for now.

00:36:37,148 --> 00:36:38,650
I need to see the photos
right away.

00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:40,819
What are you
looking for?
I'll know when I see it.

00:36:43,555 --> 00:36:45,290
Whoa. That's Ellie Brass
with our killer.

00:36:47,092 --> 00:36:49,627
Uh, metadata says the photos
were taken a year ago

00:36:49,627 --> 00:36:51,463
in Jersey City.
Nancy told Brass
that Ellie

00:36:51,463 --> 00:36:53,098
brought a guy home
with her last year,

00:36:53,098 --> 00:36:54,666
said that he was her fiancé.

00:36:54,666 --> 00:36:57,369
Wait, so Brass's daughter
knew Matthew Tarland?

00:36:57,369 --> 00:36:58,803
She's been lying to us.

00:37:00,505 --> 00:37:03,308
D.B., we have a situation.

00:37:03,308 --> 00:37:04,476
Is Brass still at the hospital?

00:37:06,044 --> 00:37:08,413
When did he leave?

00:37:12,217 --> 00:37:14,052
Hey. It's me.

00:37:14,052 --> 00:37:15,820
Got some moo goo gai pan.

00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,822
Your guys' favorite, right?

00:37:17,822 --> 00:37:19,791
Nancy?

00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:24,028
Ellie?

00:37:30,235 --> 00:37:32,170
Nancy?

00:37:46,718 --> 00:37:48,720
Ellie?

00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,588
Right here, Dad.

00:37:50,588 --> 00:37:53,725
(phone ringing)

00:37:53,725 --> 00:37:55,360
You gonna get that?

00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,462
(phone continues ringing)

00:37:57,462 --> 00:37:59,431
You shouldn't have dragged Mom
out here.

00:37:59,431 --> 00:38:01,232
She saw me with Matthew.

00:38:01,232 --> 00:38:02,467
I had no choice.

00:38:02,467 --> 00:38:04,636
You should have
just kept this

00:38:04,636 --> 00:38:07,405
between you and me.

00:38:07,405 --> 00:38:08,606
Why?

00:38:08,606 --> 00:38:11,443
Matthew and Jake
had their daddy issues,

00:38:11,443 --> 00:38:15,380
and, thanks to you... so do I.

00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:17,415
You--you and the
boys--you did...?

00:38:17,415 --> 00:38:19,684
You did this?

00:38:19,684 --> 00:38:23,588
When I had you on the phone,

00:38:23,588 --> 00:38:25,356
I asked you to make a choice.

00:38:25,356 --> 00:38:26,424
Oh, my God.

00:38:26,424 --> 00:38:28,259
You tried saving me

00:38:28,259 --> 00:38:32,063
my entire life, and you could
have saved me then, but, oh, no.

00:38:32,063 --> 00:38:34,165
Like always...

00:38:34,165 --> 00:38:35,600
(phone ringing)

00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,435
...you had to be the cop.

00:38:37,435 --> 00:38:41,773
Sounds like someone wants to get
your attention pretty bad.

00:38:41,773 --> 00:38:44,476
I know what that's like.

00:38:44,476 --> 00:38:46,478
(phone continues ringing)

00:38:46,478 --> 00:38:50,348
You killed the only
person I ever loved.

00:38:53,384 --> 00:38:55,820
The only person
who ever loved you.

00:38:58,456 --> 00:39:00,625
Ellie,

00:39:00,625 --> 00:39:02,560
you want to shoot me...

00:39:08,299 --> 00:39:10,235
...go ahead.

00:39:11,569 --> 00:39:13,805
(voice breaking):
Because...

00:39:13,805 --> 00:39:15,406
I'm dead already.

00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:20,812
What happened?

00:39:20,812 --> 00:39:22,714
(knocking)
MAN:
LVPD!

00:39:27,118 --> 00:39:29,621
Give me the gun.

00:39:44,135 --> 00:39:45,403
(gun thuds onto floor)

00:39:51,409 --> 00:39:53,444
(rhythmic beeping)

00:39:59,817 --> 00:40:01,519
Hey. Hey, hey.

00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:02,787
Dad.

00:40:02,787 --> 00:40:05,290
Uh, uh, El--Ellie...
Yeah. We know.

00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:06,491
She's in custody.
Don't worry.

00:40:08,092 --> 00:40:10,128
You are gonna be okay.

00:40:10,128 --> 00:40:12,096
(sighs)

00:40:13,665 --> 00:40:15,567
But you know what?

00:40:17,335 --> 00:40:20,038
You and I really need
to steer clear of hospitals

00:40:20,038 --> 00:40:21,606
from now on.

00:40:28,613 --> 00:40:30,515
Thought you'd already left.

00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:34,152
Not without
saying good-bye.

00:40:34,152 --> 00:40:35,787
Did you get your story?

00:40:35,787 --> 00:40:38,056
Yes. Yes, I did.

00:40:38,056 --> 00:40:39,791
Although it's not really the
story I came here to write.

00:40:39,791 --> 00:40:41,759
Should the mayor be worried?

00:40:41,759 --> 00:40:44,062
It's not a hatchet job, if
that's what you're thinking.

00:40:46,197 --> 00:40:48,633
Doesn't all just go
into the box, does it?

00:40:51,603 --> 00:40:53,571
No.

00:40:55,673 --> 00:40:58,343
There is one question
I never got to ask you.

00:40:58,343 --> 00:41:01,579
That voice inside
your head--

00:41:01,579 --> 00:41:05,350
the day that it
does go quiet...

00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:07,685
do you think that that
will bring you peace?

00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:11,656
Or will it be a loss
too great to bear?

00:41:15,326 --> 00:41:17,362
MAN:
<i>And so we gather together today</i>

00:41:17,362 --> 00:41:21,799
to mourn the loss
of our sister Nancy...

00:41:21,799 --> 00:41:24,602
taken from this life
all too soon.

00:41:24,602 --> 00:41:26,638
In grief,

00:41:26,638 --> 00:41:29,207
we throw our arms
around our brother Jim,

00:41:29,207 --> 00:41:33,544
and we pray
that his journey with Nancy

00:41:33,544 --> 00:41:35,613
to her final
resting place

00:41:35,613 --> 00:41:40,485
will bring them both peace.

00:41:40,485 --> 00:41:44,489
The lesson of
Job is clear.

00:41:44,489 --> 00:41:46,758
Even in a moment of

00:41:46,758 --> 00:41:50,762
immeasurable sorrow
like this one,

00:41:50,762 --> 00:41:52,730
we're given a choice.

00:41:54,699 --> 00:41:59,170
A choice between the
hopelessness of despair,

00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:03,775
and the everlasting
promise of faith.

00:42:03,775 --> 00:42:06,044
Faith...

00:42:06,044 --> 00:42:07,745
<i>that there is a plan.</i>

00:42:07,745 --> 00:42:13,184
<i>And that in times of doubt,</i>
<i>God will speak to us</i>

00:42:13,184 --> 00:42:18,189
<i>in a voice that is clear</i>
<i>and true.</i>
